INTRODUCTION\n\nOver the past two decades advances in microscopy and\nmicroscale control have allowed scientists and engineers\nto delve into the workings of the biological matter. One\ncentury after Kelvin's death, today's researchers aim to\nexplain how the engines of life actually work by stretching\nthermodynamics beyond its 19th-century limits (Haw,\n2007).\nCarnot realized that all engines transform energy from\none form into another with a maximum possible efficiency\nthat does not depend on the technology developed or\non the fuel utilized, but rather on fundamental quantities such as heat and temperature. Kelvin and Clausius came up with two \"rules of the engine\", later known\nas the first two laws of thermodynamics. The first law\nstates that energy cannot be destroyed or created but\nonly transformed; the second law sets fundamental limitations to what energy transformation can achieve in\npractical terms. Just as the first law was centered on the\nnotion of energy (from Greek for \"work capability\"), the\nsecond law revolved around the new concept of entropy (a\nterm coined by Clausius also from Greek for \"change capability\"). 1 When expressed in such terms, the second\nlaw states that entropy cannot decrease during any spontaneous or natural process. Notably, within the whole,\nvirtual manufactory of all natural processes the first law\ntakes on the role of an account clerk, keeping track of all\nenergy changes, while the second law takes on the role of\nthe director, determining the direction and action of all\nprocesses.\nThe fathers of thermodynamics developed their laws\nhaving in mind macroscopic systems that they could describe in terms of state (i.e., average) quantities such as\n\n1\n\nRudolf Julius Emanuel Clausius throughout his life allegedly preferred the German word \"Verwandlungswert\" rather than \"entropy\", although his colleagues suggested him to choose a name\nfor his new thermodynamic quantity \"S\" (his chosen symbol for\nlabeling \"entropy\", possibly in honor of \"S\"adi Carnot) that\nsounded as close as possible to the word \"energy\".\n\npressure and temperature, a reasonable assumption when\ndealing with the monster steam engines of the Victorian\nindustry. A typical protein, however, is a few nanometers in size and consists of just a few tens of thousands\nof atoms. As a consequence the movements of a protein engine are swamped by the fluctuations resulting\nfrom the Brownian motion of its surroundings, which\ncauses the energy of any its part to fluctuate continually in units of kT , with k denoting the Boltzmann constant and T the temperature. The effects of such energy\nfluctuations were brilliantly demonstrated by Yanagida's\ngroup (Nishiyama et al., 2002, 2001), who observed kinesin molecules climbing the cytoskeletal track in a juddering motion made up of random hesitations, jumps and\neven backward steps. Similar results have been reported\nfor a host of protein engines. The key question in modern thermodynamics is therefore how far energy fluctuations drive micro- and nano-engines beyond the limits of\nmacroscopic laws.\nA revealing experiment was performed recently by Bustamante et al. (2005), who first stretched a single RNA\nmolecule, by optically tugging at a tiny plastic bead attached to one end, and then released the bead to study\nthe effect of random energy fluctuations on the molecule\nrecovery process. By repeating many identical stretching\ncycles, these authors found that the molecule \"relaxation\npath\" was different every time. In fact, the bead was\ndrawing useful energy from the thermal motion of the\nsuspension fluid and transforming it into motion. However, by averaging over increasingly longer bead trajectories that is, approaching a macroscopic situation, Bustamante et al. (2005) were able to reconcile their findings\nwith the second law. These results lead to the conclusion that the straightforward extension of the second law\nto microscopic systems was ungranted; individual small\nsystems do evolve under inherently nonequilibrium conditions.\nHowever, a decade ago Jarzynski (1997) showed that\nthe demarcation line between equilibrium and nonequilibrium processes is not always as clear cut as we were\nused to think. Imagining a microscopic single molecule\nprocess, Jarzynski evaluated not the simple average of the\nchange of the (random) work of the underlying perturbed\nnanosystem, as it was pulled away from equilibrium according to an arbitrary protocol of forcing, but rather\nthe average of the exponential of that tailored nonequilibrium work. Remarkably, such a quantity turned out\nto be the same as for an adiabatically slow version of\nthe same process, and most remarkably, equals the exponential of the system's equilibrium free energy change.\nThis result, also experimentally demonstrated by Bustamante et al. (2005), came as much of a surprise because\nit meant that information about macroscopic equilibrium\nwas somehow buried inside individual, randomly fluctuating microscopic systems far from equilibrium, see also\n(Crooks, 1999; Gallavotti and Cohen, 1995; Jarzynski,\n2007; Talkner et al., 2008, 2007).\nThere is an additional limitation of 19th-century ther-\n\n\f3\nmodynamics that is potentially even more significant in\nthe design and operation of engines at the sub-micron\nscales. Kelvin's thermodynamics was based on the simplifying notion of an isolated system. The laws of macroscopic thermodynamics therefore apply only to systems\nthat are either separated from their environment or coupled to it under controlled operating conditions, that is,\nmeasured in terms of the state variables of the system itself. However, at variance with a cylinder inside a steam\nengine, protein engines do not (cannot) work in isolation.\nVery much on the footsteps of the 19th-century scientists and engineers, modern experimenters have probed\nthe proteins that play a crucial role in the cell individually by feeding them with energy by injecting some chemical fuel \"by hand\" (e.g., ATP molecules) or exerting\nmechanical actions of some sort (Astumian, 1997; Bustamante et al., 2005). In their natural setting, however,\nlife engines are just parts of a closely interconnected functional web that keeps a cell alive. The great challenge of\nsystems biology is therefore to put our understanding of\nisolated life engines back into the real world of the cell.\n\nbe artificially manufactured by many orders of magnitude. Nevertheless, inorganic nanodevices are attracting\ngrowing interest as a viable option due to their potential\nsimplicity and robustness, without forgetting that inorganic nanodevices may provide additional experimental\naccess to the molecular machinery itself.\nWith this review the authors intend to pursue further\nthe inorganic approach to nanodevices, based on three\nmain assumptions: (1) That, in view of the most recent developments on nonequilibrium thermodynamics,\nthe science of nanodevices, regardless of the fabrication\ntechnique, is inseparable from the thermodynamics of\nmicroscopic engines (H\u00e4nggi et al., 2005); (2) That the\nfabrication techniques on the nanoscales become more\nand more performing following the trend of the last two\ndecades; (3) That a better understanding of the molecular machinery can help devise and implement new transport and control mechanisms for biology inspired nanodevices. In other words, we bet on a two-way crossfertilization between the biomimetic and the inorganic\napproach.\n\n1. Artificial nanodevices\n\n2. Brownian motors\n\nNanotechnology has been intricately linked with biological systems since its inception. Fascinated by the\ncomplexity and smallness of the cell, Feynman (1960)\nchallenged the scientific community to \"make a thing\nvery small which does what we want\". In his visionary\nresponse, Drexler (1992) proposed to focus on protein\nsynthesis as a pathway for creating nanoscale devices.\nBoth Feynman and Drexler's propositions have been met\nwith much skepticism as accurate manipulations at the\nnanoscale were deemed impossible. However, in view of\nthe recent advances in systems biology (Gross, 1999), cellular mechanisms are now being cited as the key proof\nof the nanotechnological viability of devices with atomic\nprecision. In spite of their established complementarity,\na fundamental difference between systems biology and\nnanotechnology is their ultimate goal. Systems biology\naims to uncover the fundamental operation of the cell in\nan effort to predict the exact response to specific stimuli\nand genetic variations, whereas nanotechnology is chiefly\nconcerned with useful design.\nManufacturing nanodevices through positional assembly and self-assembly of biological components available\nat the cellular level is the goal of the so-called biomimetic\napproach \u2013 as opposed to the inorganic approach aimed\nat fabricating nanomechanical devices in hard, inorganic\nmaterials (e.g., using modern lithographic techniques,\natomic force and scanning tunneling microscopy, etc).\nNature has already proven that it is possible to engineer complex machines on the nanoscale; there is an existing framework of working components manufactured\nby Nature than can be used as a guide to develop our\nown biology inspired nanodevices. It is also true that the\nmolecular machinery still outperforms anything that can\n\nNature provided microorganisms, with characteristic\nsizes of about 10\u22125 m, with a variety of self-propulsion\nmechanisms, all of which pertain to motion induced by\ncyclic shape changes. During one such cycle the configuration changes follow an asymmetric sequence, where\none half cycle does not simply retrace the other half, in\norder to circumvent the absence of hydrodynamic inertia\nat the microscales, i.e., for low Reynolds numbers (Purcell, 1977). A typical example are motile bacteria that\n\"swim\" in a suspension fluid by rotating or waving their\nflagella (Astumian, 2007; Astumian and H\u00e4nggi, 2002).\nAs anticipated above, a further complication arises when\nthe moving parts of a (sub)micron-engine have molecular dimensions of 10\u22128 m or so. In that case, diffusion\ncaused by Brownian motion competes with self-propelled\nmotion. For example, a molecular motor mechanism becomes superior if at room temperature, and in a medium\nwith viscosity close to that of water, a bacterium needs\nmore time to diffuse a body length than it does to swim\nthe same distance. A passive diffusive mechanism operating alone simply becomes inefficient.\nA solution common to most cell machinery is to have\nmolecular motors operating on a track that constrains\nthe motion to essentially one dimension along a periodic\nsequence of wells and barriers. The energy barriers significantly suppress the diffusion, while thermal noise plays\na constructive role by providing a mechanism, thermal\nactivation (H\u00e4nggi et al., 1990), by which motors can\nescape over the barriers. The energy necessary for directed motion is supplied by asymmetrically raising and\nlowering the barriers and wells, either via an external\ntime-dependent modulation (e.g., due to the coupling\nwith other motors) or by energy input from a nonequi-\n\n\f4\nlibrium source such as a chemical reaction, like the ATP\nhydrolysis. Thus, in agreement with the reasoning underlying the analysis 2 of the Smoluchowski-Feynman\nstylized ratchet engine (Feynman et al., 1963; Smoluchowski, 1912), under appropriate nonequilibrium conditions, structural anisotropy can sustain directed motion.\nSuch a device clearly does not violate the second law of\nthermodynamics because the very presence of nonequilibrium renders inoperative those limiting (thermal equilibrium) restrictions.\nIn the case of a bacterium, as for any ordinary heat engine, the relevant state variables, namely, its position and\nthe phase of the flagellum stroke, always cycle through\none and the same periodic time sequence; the two variables are tightly coupled and almost synchronized. In\nclear contrast to this familiar scenario, the state variables of molecular motors are often loosely coupled due\nto the prominent action of fluctuations, a salient feature\nnicely captured by H\u00e4nggi who originally coined the term\nBrownian motors in the feature (Bartussek and H\u00e4nggi,\n1995). 3\nImportant hallmarks of any genuine Brownian motor\nare (Astumian and H\u00e4nggi, 2002; H\u00e4nggi et al., 2005): (i)\nThe presence of some amount of (not necessarily thermal)\nnoise. The intricate interplay among nonlinearity, noiseactivated escape dynamics and non-equilibrium driving\nimplies that, generally, not even the direction of transport is a priori predictable; (ii) Some sort of symmetrybreaking supplemented by temporal periodicity (typically via an unbiased, non-equilibrium forcing), if a cyclically operating device is involved. Therefore, not every\nsmall ratchet device falls under the category of Brownian\nmotors. This holds true especially if the governing transport principle is deterministic, like in mechanical ratchet\ndevices of macro- or mesoscopic size.\nThe following prescriptions should be observed when\ndesigning an efficient Brownian motor: (a) Spatial and\ntemporal periodicity critically affect rectification; (b) All\nacting forces and gradients must vanish after averaging\nover space, time, and statistical ensembles; (c) Random\nforces (of thermal, non-thermal, or even deterministic\norigin) assume a prominent role; (d) Detailed balance\nsymmetry, ruling thermal equilibrium dynamics, must be\nbroken by operating the device away from thermal equilibrium; (e) A symmetry-breaking mechanism must apply. There exist several possibilities to induce symmetrybreaking. First, the spatial inversion symmetry of the\n\n2\n3\n\nNote in this context also the insightful examination of Feynman's\nanalysis by Parrondo and Espanol (1996).\nThe notion of \"molecular motor\" is reserved within this review\nfor motors specifying biological, intracelluar transport. Likewise, the notion of \"Brownian ratchet\" or \"thermal ratchet\" is\nreserved for the operating principle of protein translocation processes. The latter term seemingly has been introduced by Simon\net al. (1992) to describe isothermal trapping of Brownian particles to drive protein translocation, see also in Wang and Oster\n(2002).\n\nperiodic system itself may be broken intrinsically; that\nis, already in the absence of non-equilibrium perturbations. This is the most common situation and typically\ninvolves a type of periodic, asymmetric ratchet potential.\nA second option consists in the use of an unbiased driving force (deterministic or stochastic, alike) possessing\nnon-vanishing, higher order odd time-correlations. Yet\na third possibility arises via collective effects in coupled,\nperfectly symmetric non-equilibrium systems, namely in\nthe form of spontaneous symmetry breaking. Note that\nin the latter two cases we speak of a Brownian motor dynamics even though a ratchet potential is not necessarily\ninvolved.\nThe reasoning of using unbiased thermal fluctuations\nand/or unbiased nonequilibrium perturbations to drive\ndirected motion of particles and alike has seen several\nrediscoveries since the visionary works by Marian von\nSmoluchowski (1912) and Richard P. Feynman et al.\n(1963). From a historic perspective, the theme of directed transport and Brownian motors was put into the\nlimelight of the statistical and biological physics research\nwith the appearance of several ground-breaking works,\nboth theoretical and experimental, which appeared during the (1992-1994) period. Most notably, Ajdari and\nProst (1992); Astumian and Bier (1994); Bartussek et al.\n(1994); Chauwin et al. (1994); Doering et al. (1994); Magnasco (1993); Millonas and Dykman (1994); Prost et al.\n(1994); Rousselet et al. (1994) helped ignite a tumultuous activity in this topical area which kept growing\nuntil the present days. The readers may deepen their\nhistorical insight by consulting earlier introductory reports such as those published by Astumian (1997); Astumian and H\u00e4nggi (2002); H\u00e4nggi and Bartussek (1996);\nH\u00e4nggi et al. (2005); J\u00fclicher et al. (1997); Reimann\n(2002); Reimann and H\u00e4nggi (2002).\nThis review focuses on the recent advances in the science of non-biological, artificial Brownian motors.\nIn contrast to those reviews and feature articles mentioned above, which beautifully cover the rich variety of\npossible Brownian motor scenarios and working principles, our focus in this review is on non-biological, artificial, mostly, solid state based Brownian motors. In this\nspirit the authors have attempted to present a comprehensive overview of the present status of this field, including newest theory developments, most compelling experimental demonstrations, and first successful technological\napplications. Some closely related topics, such as the\nengineering of synthetic molecular motors and nanomachines based on chemical species, are only briefly discussed herein because comprehensive, up-to-date reviews\nhave been published recently by research groups very active in that area (Balzani et al., 2006; Kay et al., 2007;\nKottas et al., 2005).\n\n\f5\nII. SINGLE-PARTICLE TRANSPORT\n\nSignal rectification schemes in the absence of noise\nhave been known since long ago, especially in the electrical engineering literature. However, rectification in\na nanodevices cannot ignore fluctuations and Brownian\nmotion, in particular. New experiments on both biological and artificial devices showed how noise rectification can actually be utilized to effectively control particle\ntransport on the small scales. By now, noise rectification has become one of the most promising techniques\nfor powering micro- and nanodevices.\nIn order to set the stage, in the next subsection we first\nconsider the case of systems where rectification cannot\noccur. In the following subsections we then single out all\ningredients that do make rectification possible.\nLet us consider a Brownian particle with mass m, coordinate x(t), and friction coefficient \u03b3 in one dimension,\nsubjected to an external static force F and thermal noise\n\u03be(t). The corresponding stochastic dynamics is described\nby the inertial Langevin equation\nm\u1e8d = \u2212V 0 (x) \u2212 m\u03b3 \u1e8b + F + \u03be(t),\n\n(1)\n\nwhere V (x) is a periodic potential with period L, namely\nV (x + L) = V (x), and 0 indicates the differentiation with\nrespect to x and \u1e8b the differentiation with respect to\ntime t. Thermal fluctuations are modeled by a stationary\nGaussian noise of vanishing mean, h\u03be(t)i = 0, satisfying\nthe fluctuation-dissipation relation\nh\u03be(t)\u03be(0)i = 2Dp \u03b4(t),\n\n(2)\n\nwhere the momentum-diffusion strength reads Dp =\nm\u03b3kT , with k denoting the Boltzmann constant, and T\nis the temperature of an equilibrium heat bath.\nIn extremely small systems, particle dynamics and fluctuations occurring in biological and liquid environments\nare often described well by the overdamped limit of Eq.\n(1), \u2013 for an illustrative discussion of this fact see the account given by Purcell (1977)\u2013, in terms of a the massless\nLangevin equation, which is driven by a position-diffusion\nDx = kT /(m\u03b3) \u2261 D, i.e.,\n0\n\n\u1e8b = \u2212V (x) + F + \u03be(t) ,\n\n(3)\n\nwith a corresponding noise correlation\nh\u03be(t)\u03be(0)i = 2D\u03b4(t) .\n\n(4)\n\nIn this overdamped regime, the inertia term m\u1e8d can\nbe dropped altogether with respect to the friction term\n\u2212m\u03b3 \u1e8b (Smoluchowski approximation). Here m\u03b3 has\nbeen scaled to unity for convenience, i.e., D \u2261 kT .\nIn the absence of an external bias, i.e. F = 0, the equilibrium stochastic mechanism in Eq. (1) cannot sustain\na non-zero stationary current, i.e., h\u1e8b(t)i = 0, no matter what V (x). This can be readily proven upon solving\nthe corresponding Fokker-Planck equation with periodic\nboundary conditions (Mel'nikov, 1991; Risken, 1984).\n\nFIG. 1 (Color online) (a) Tilted periodic potential of Eq.\n(5), V (x) \u2212 xF , with F = 0.1; (b) Locked-to-running transitions. The thresholds F1 and F3 of the hysteretic loop (dashed\ncurves) and the zero temperature step at F2 (solid curve)\nare marked explicitly. Parameter values: m = V0 = 1, i.e.\nF3 = 1, and \u03b3 = 0.03.\n\nA. Symmetric substrates\n\nLet us consider first the case when the periodic substrate with the potential V (x) is symmetric under reflection, that is V (x \u2212 x0 ) = V (\u2212x + x0 ) for certain x0 with\nx0 \u2264 x0 < L. The most studied example is the symmetric washboard potential (Risken, 1984)\nV (x) = \u2212V0 sin(2\u03c0x/L),\n\n(5)\n\ndisplayed in presence of a static tilt-force F in Fig. 1a.\nThe particle mobility \u03bc(F ) \u2261 h\u1e8bi/F is symmetric for\nF \u2192 \u2212F , namely, \u03bc(F ) = \u03bc(\u2212F ). For this reason in\nthis section we restrict ourselves to F \u2265 0.\n\n1. dc drive\n\nThe Brownian motion, Eq. (1), in the washboard potential, Eq. (5), is detailed in Risken (1984) textbook. To\nmake contact with Risken's notation one must rewrite\nEq. (1) in terms of the rescaled quantities x \u2192 2\u03c0\nL x,\n2\u03c0 F\n2\u03c0 2 T\nF \u2192 L m , and T \u2192 ( L ) m , so that\n\u1e8d = \u2212\u03b3 \u1e8b + \u03c902 cos x + F + \u03be(t).\n(6)\np\nThe angular frequency \u03c90 = (2\u03c0/L) V0 /m characterizes\nthe oscillating motion of the particle at the bottom of\nthe potential wells. To reconcile Eq. (6) with Eq. (1)\nfor the potential in Eq. (5), it suffices to scale m = 1\nand L = 2\u03c0, as assumed throughout this section, unless\nstated otherwise.\nThe dynamics of Eq. (6) is characterized by random switches occurring either between two locked states,\ndwelling a well minimum, or switches between a locked\n\n\f6\nstate with zero average velocity and a (downhill) running state with a finite, average asymptotic velocity\nh\u1e8bi = F/\u03b3. In terms of mobility, locked and running\nstates correspond to \u03b3\u03bc = 0 and \u03b3\u03bc = 1, respectively.\nIn the overdamped regime, Eq. (3), the particle is\ntrapped most of the time at a local minimum of the tilted\nsubstrate as long as F \u2264 F3 = \u03c902 ; for F > F3 there exist\nno such minima and the particle runs in the F direction\nwith average speed approaching F/\u03b3. This behavior is\ndescribed quantitatively by the mobility formula (Risken,\n1984):\n\u03bc(F ) =\n\nL\n,\nht(L, F )iF\n\n(7)\n\nwhere ht(L, F )i, the mean first-passage time of the particle across a substrate unit cell in the F direction, can\nbe computed explicitly for any choice of V (x) (H\u00e4nggi\net al., 1990).\nIn the underdamped regime \u03b3 \u001c \u03c90 the locked-torunning transition depends crucially on the presence of\nnoise, no matter how weak. In the noiseless case, \u03be(t) \u2261\n0, the average speed of a Brownian particle with coordinate x(t) depends on the initial conditions according to\nthe hysteretic cycle illustrated in Fig. 1b: The transition\nfrom the locked to the running state occurs on raising F\nabove F3 (depinning threshold), while the opposite transition takes place on lowering F below F1 = (4/\u03c0)\u03b3\u03c90 (repinning threshold). Of course, for sufficiently large values\nof \u03b3, say, in the damped regime with \u03b3 > \u03b30 = (\u03c0/4)\u03c90 ,\nthe distinction between F1 and F3 becomes meaningless;\nthe locked-to-running transition occurs at F = F3 , no\nmatter what the initial conditions.\nAt zero temperature, T = 0+, we have a totally different scenario, as the stationary dynamics of x(t) is\ncontrolled by one threshold F2 = 3.3576 . . . \u03b3\u03c90 , only\n(Risken, 1984): For F < F2 the Brownian particle remains trapped in one potential well; for F > F2 it falls\ndown the tilted washboard potential with speed close to\nF/\u03b3. At the threshold F2 the quantity \u03b3\u03bc jumps from\nzero to (very close to) one, stepwise (Fig. 1b). Note that,\nat variance with F3 , F2 indicates a dynamical transition\noccurring in the presence of a relatively small tilt. Nevertheless, at low damping, switches between locked and\nrunning states correspond to long forward particle jumps,\nwhich can span over many substrate unit cells L; the distributions of the relevant jump lengths exhibit persistent\nnon-exponential tails (Borromeo and Marchesoni, 2000;\nCostantini and Marchesoni, 1999; Ferrando et al., 1995;\nPollak et al., 1993; Shushin, 2002).\nFor finite but low temperatures, kT \u001c V0 , the transition from the locked to the running state is continuous\nbut still confined within a narrow neighborhood of F2 ;\nthe relevant locked-to-running transition threshold Fth\nis numerically identifiable with high accuracy as a convex function of \u03b3; F2 and F3 are respectively the \u03b3 \u2192 0\nand \u03b3 \u2192 \u221e asymptotes of the numerical curve Fth (\u03b3)\n(Risken, 1984).\n\n2. ac drive\n\nSuppose now that the external force F (t) acting on\nthe unit-mass Brownian particle is periodic in time. The\nsimplest case possible is represented by a noiseless particle, \u03be(t) \u2261 0, moving on a sinusoidal potential, Eq. (5),\nunder the action of a harmonic force\nF (t) = A1 cos(\u03a91 t + \u03c61 ).\n\n(8)\n\nThe wide class of devices thus modeled may be assimilated to a damped-driven pendulum operated at zero\nnoise level, a chaotic system investigated at depth in\nthe 1980s (Baker and Gollub, 1990). The dynamics of\na massive particle in a sinusoidal potential was reproduced in terms of a climbing-sine map (Geisel and Nierwetberg, 1982; Grossmann and Fujisaka, 1982): Running orbits, leading to a spontaneous symmetry breaking, can be either periodic or diffusive, depending on\nthe value of the map control parameter (viz. the amplitude of the sine term). The phase-space portrait of\nthe actual damped-driven pendulum was computed by\nHuberman et al. (1980), who revealed the existence of\ndelocalized strange attractors with an intricate structure\non all scales, later recognized to be fractal objects (Baker\nand Gollub, 1990). This means that, despite the global\nreflection symmetry of the dynamics in Eqs. (1) and (8),\nfor sufficiently small \u03b3 the particle drifts either to the\nright or the to left, depending on the initial conditions,\nbut with equal probability in phase-space.\nCoupling the particle to a heat bath, no matter how\nlow the temperature, changes this scenario completely.\nThe action of the noise source \u03be(t) amounts to scrambling the initial conditions, which therefore must be averaged on. As a consequence, trajectories to the right\nand to the left compensate one another and the symmetry is restored: No Brownian drift is expected in the zero\ntemperature limit.\nA system symmetry can be broken by adding a dc component A0 to the external force,\nF (t) = A0 + A1 cos(\u03a91 t + \u03c61 ).\n\n(9)\n\nThe most evident effect of such a periodic drive is the\nappearance of hysteresis loops (Borromeo et al., 1999) in\nthe parametric curves of the mobility \u03bc(t) versus F (t).\nFor \u03a91 \u001c \u03c90 and A0 \u001c Fth , the mobility hysteresis\nloop is centered on the static mobility curve \u03bc(A0 ) and\ntraversed counterclockwise; with decreasing \u03a91 , its major\naxis approaches the tangent to the curve \u03bc(A0 ). Hysteresis loops have been observed even for \u03a91 much smaller\nthan the relevant Kramers rate, the smallest relaxation\nrate in the unperturbed stationary process of Eq. (6)\nwith F = 0. The area encircled by the hysteretic loops\nis maximum for A0 ' Fth , that is close to the transition\njump. Even more interestingly, it exhibits a resonant\ndependence on both the forcing frequency and the temperature, thus pointing to a dynamical stochastic resonance (Gammaitoni et al., 1998) mechanism between\n\n\f7\nlocked and running states (Borromeo and Marchesoni,\n2000).\nFinally, Machura et al. (2007a) showed that under special conditions, involving small Brownian motion at temperature T and appropriate relaxation constants \u03b3 <\n\u223c\n\u03a91 <\n\u223c \u03c90 , the damped process in Eq. (6) occasionally\nexhibits the phenomenon of absolute negative mobility:\nThe ac cycle averaged drift velocity h\u1e8bi may be oriented\nagainst the dc bias A0 , as the result of a delicate interplay of chaotic and stochastic dynamics. This observation was corroborated theoretically by Speer et al. (2007)\nand Kostur et al. (2008) and experimentally by Nagel\net al. (2008). Yet, another artificial Brownian motor system where this phenomenon can likely be validated experimentally are cold atoms dwelling in periodic optical\nlattices.\n3. Diffusion peak\n\nDiffusive transport of particles or, more generally,\nsmall objects is a ubiquitous feature of physical and\nchemical reaction systems (Burada et al., 2009). Directed\nBrownian motor transport is typically controlled both\nby the fluctuation statistics of the jittering objects and\nthe phase space available to their dynamics. For example, as the particle in Eq. (6) drifts with average speed\nh\u1e8bi in the direction of the external force F , the random\nswitches between locked and running state cause a spatial dispersion of the particle around its average position\nThe corresponding normal diffusion constant,\nhx(t)2 i \u2212 hx(t)i2\n,\n(10)\nt\u2192\u221e\n2t\nwas computed numerically as a function of F at constant\ntemperature by Costantini and Marchesoni (1999). A\npeak in the curves of D versus F is detectable in the\nvicinity of the transition threshold Fth , irrespective of\nthe value of \u03b3. In particular, at low damping, where\nFth ' F2 , and low temperature, kT \u001c \u03c902 , the peak of D\nat F = F2 is very pronounced; on increasing the damping, the diffusion peak eventually shrinks down to just a\nbump corresponding to the threshold Fth ' F3 . In any\ncase, in an appropriate neighborhood of Fth the diffusion constant can grow larger than Einstein's diffusion\nconstant for the free Brownian motion in one dimension,\nD0 = kT /\u03b3. On increasing T the diffusion peak eventually disappears, no matter what \u03b3.\nA refined analytical formula for the diffusion peak was\nobtained by Reimann and collaborators who regarded the\nlocked-to-running transition in the overdamped regime as\na renewal process, that is (Reimann et al., 2001, 2002):\nD(F ) = lim\n\nD(F ) =\n\nL2 ht2 (L, F )i \u2212 ht(L, F )i2\n,\n2\nht(L, F )i3\n\n(11)\n\nwhere the n-th moments of the first passage time,\nhtn (L, F )i, can be computed explicitly. For F \u2192 0, Eq.\n(11) reproduces the zero-bias identity D/D0 = \u03b3\u03bc (Festa\nand d'Agliano, 1978).\n\n4. Single-file diffusion\n\nWhen a gas of particles is confined to a linear path, an\nindividual particle cannot diffuse past its neighbors. This\nconstrained 1D geometry is often called a \"single-file\",\nor Jepsen gas (Harris, 1974; Jepsen, 1965). Let us consider a file of N indistinguishable, unit-mass Brownian\nparticles moving on a tilted sinusoidal substrate in Eq.\n(6) of length L. If the particle interaction is hard-core\n(zero radius), the file constituents can be labeled according to a given ordered sequence and the long-time diffusion of an individual particle gets strongly suppressed.\nIn early studies (Harris, 1974; Jepsen, 1965; Lebowitz\nand Percus, 1967; Levitt, 1973; Marchesoni and Taloni,\n2006) the mean square displacement of a single particle in\nthe thermodynamic limit (L, N \u2192 \u221e with constant density \u03c1 = N/L) was calculated analytically. Those results\nwere generalized to the diffusion of a single-file of driven\nBrownian particles on a periodic substrate by Taloni and\nMarchesoni (2006) who derived the subdiffusive law\n2\nlim [hx(t) i \u2212 hx(t)i ] =\nt\u2192\u221e\n\u03c1\n2\n\nr\n\n2\n\nD(F )t\n,\n\u03c0\n\n(12)\n\nwith D(F ) given in Eq. (11). This result applies to any\nchoice of the substrate potential V (x) (Burada et al.,\n2009) and to the transport of composite objects (Heinsalu et al., 2008), as well. Excess diffusion peaks have\nbeen obtained experimentally in the context of particle\ntransport in quasi-1D systems (Sec. III).\n\nB. Rectification of asymmetric processes\n\nStochastic transport across a device surely can be induced by applying a macroscopic gradient, like a force\nor a temperature difference. However, under many practical circumstances this is no viable option: (a) Current\ninduced by macroscopic gradients are rarely selective; (b)\nA target particle that carries no charge or dipole, can\nhardly be manipulated by means of an external field of\nforce; (c) External controls, including powering, critically\noverburden the design of a small device. Ideally, the optimal solution would be a self-propelled device that operates by rectifying environmental signals. In the quest\nfor rectification mechanisms of easy implementation, we\nwill start from the symmetric dynamics of Eq. (1) and\nadd the minimal ingredients needed to induce and control\nparticle transport.\nIf V (x) is symmetric under reflection, the only way to\ninduce a drift of the Brownian particle consists in driving it by means of a non-symmetric force F (t), either\ndeterministic or random (Astumian and H\u00e4nggi, 2002;\nChialvo et al., 1997; H\u00e4nggi et al., 1996; Luczka et al.,\n1995; Reimann and H\u00e4nggi, 2002). Here, \"symmetric\"\nmeans that all force moments are invariant under sign\nreversal F \u2192 \u2212F . Note thatR the condition of a vanisht\ning dc component, limt\u2192\u221e 1t 0 F (s)ds = 0, would not be\n\n\f8\nsufficient. For instance, a bi-harmonic signal with commensurate frequencies and arbitrary phase constants, although zero-mean valued, is in general nonsymmetric.\nOn the contrary, particles in an asymmetric potential\ncan drift on average in one direction even when all perturbing forces or gradients are symmetric. However, as\npointed out in Sec. II.D, to achieve directed transport in\nsuch a class of devices, the external perturbation is required to be at least time-correlated, like in the presence\nof a non-Markovian noise source (correlation ratchets) or\na time periodic drive (rocked and pulsated ratchets).\nThe interplay of time and space asymmetry in the\noperation of a Brownian motor has been established\non firmer mathematical grounds by Yevtushenko et al.\n(2001) and by Reimann (2001). Let us slightly generalize the overdamped dynamics in Eq. (3) to incorporate\nthe case of time dependent substrates, that is\n\u1e8b = \u2212V 0 [x, F2 (t)] + F1 (t) + \u03be(t).\n\n(13)\n\nThe potential V [x, F2 (t)] is termed supersymmetric\n(Jung and H\u00e4nggi, 1991; Marchesoni et al., 1988) if, for\nan appropriate choice of the x and t origins,\n\u2212 V [x, F2 (t)] = V [x + L/2, F2 (\u2212t)].\n\n(14)\n\nAnalogously, the additive drive F1 (t) is supersymmetric\nif for an appropriate t origin,\n\u2212 F1 (t) = F1 (\u2212t).\n\n(15)\n\nShould Fi (t), with i = 1, 2, be stationary noises, clearly\nno restriction can be set on the t origin; the equalities in\nEq. (14) and in Eq. (15) must then hold in a statistical\nsense, meaning that the two terms of each equality must\nbe statistically indistinguishable.\nLet us consider now the time reversed process z(t) =\nx(\u2212t) + L/2. By definition, h\u017ci = \u2212h\u1e8bi, whereas,\non simultaneously imposing the supersymmetry conditions (14) and (15), the Langevin equation (13) yields\nh\u017ci = h\u1e8bi; hence, h\u1e8bi = 0. As a consequence, a nonzero\nrectification current requires that either the substrate or\nthe additive drive (or both) are non-supersymmetric.\nWe remark that the above theorem has been proven\nonly for zero-mass particles, that is, when the Smoluchowski regime m\u1e8d = 0 applies. In the presence of inertia, instead, rectification may occur, under very special conditions, also in fully supersymmetric devices, as\nshown lately by Machura et al. (2007a) for a rocked cosine potential.\nC. Nonlinear mechanisms\n\nIn this Section we review transport on symmetric substrates driven by asymmetric forces. The rectification\nmechanisms outlined below can be traced back to the\nnonlinear nature of the substrate; for this reason, at variance with Brownian motors, they work also, if not more\neffectively, in the absence of noise.\n\nWe remind the reader that these mechanisms have\nbeen introduced and demonstrated experimentally in the\nmost diverse fields of physics and engineering. Direct applications to various categories of artificial nanodevices\nwill be discussed in the subsequent sections.\n\n1. Harmonic mixing\n\nA charged particle spatially confined by a nonlinear\nforce is capable of mixing two alternating input electric\nfields of angular frequencies \u03a91 and \u03a92 , its response containing all possible higher harmonics of \u03a91 and \u03a92 . For\ncommensurate input frequencies, i.e., \u03a91 /\u03a92 = n/m with\nn and m coprime integer numbers, the output contains\na dc component, too (Schneider and Seeger, 1966); harmonic mixing thus induces a rectification effect of the\n(n + m)-th order in the dynamical parameters of the system (Goychuk and H\u00e4nggi, 1998; Marchesoni, 1986).\nLet us consider the overdamped stochastic dynamics\nof Eq. (3) in the potential of Eq. (5), driven by the\nbi-harmonic force\nF (t) = A1 cos(\u03a91 t + \u03c61 ) + A2 cos(\u03a92 t + \u03c62 )\n\n(16)\n\nLet the two harmonic components of F (t) be commensurate with one another, meaning that \u03a91 , \u03a92 are integervalued multiples of a fundamental frequency \u03a90 , i.e.,\n\u03a91 = n\u03a90 and \u03a92 = m\u03a90 . For small amplitudes and\nlow frequencies of the drive in Eq. (16), a simple expansion of the mobility function, Eq. (7), in powers of\nF (t), yields, after time averaging, the following approximate expression for the non-vanishing dc component of\nthe particle velocity:\nm+n\nh\u1e8bi = 2\u03bc\nm! n!\n\n\u0012\n\nA1\n2\n\n\u0013m \u0012\n\nA2\n2\n\n\u0013n\ncos(\u2206m,n ),\n\n(17)\n\nwhere \u03bc is the positive (n + m \u2212 1)-th derivative of \u03bc(F )\nat F = 0, \u2206m,n = n\u03c62 \u2212 m\u03c61 , and m + n is an odd\nnumber. Harmonic mixing currents j = h\u1e8bi/L clearly result from a spontaneous symmetry breaking mechanism:\nindeed, averaging j over \u03c61 or \u03c62 would eliminate the\neffect completely. This is true under any regime of temperature and forcing, as proven by means of standard\nperturbation techniques (Breymayer and Wonneberger,\n1981; Marchesoni, 1986). In particular, rectification of\ntwo small commensurate driving signals, A1 , A2 \u001c \u03c902 , is\na noise assisted process and, therefore, is strongly suppressed for kT \u001c \u03c902 , when \u03bc decays exponentially to\nzero (Risken, 1984). Moreover, we anticipate that accounting for finite inertia effects requires introducing in\nEq. (17) an additional damping and frequency dependent\nphase-lag, as discussed in Sec. IV.A.\nIn all calculations of h\u1e8bi, including Eq. (17), the reflection symmetry of V (x) plays no significant role; rectification via harmonic mixing is caused solely by the nonlinearity of the substrate. However, it must be noticed,\n\n\f9\n2. Gating\n\nA periodically-driven Brownian motion can also be rectified by modulating the amplitude of the substrate potential V (x). Let us specialize the overdamped dynamics\nin Eq. (13) as follows:\n\u1e8b = \u2212V 0 (x)[1 + F2 (t)] + F1 (t) + \u03be(t)\n\nFIG. 2 Gating mechanism. Equation (19) has been simulated\nnumerically for \u03a91 = \u03a92 = 0.01, \u03c61 = \u03c62 = 0, A1 = A2 = A,\nand V (x) = \u03c902 (1\u2212cos x) with \u03c90 = 1; the net velocity h\u1e8bi has\nbeen plotted versus D = kT for different amplitudes A. For\n\u221aa\ncomparison we show h\u1e8bi versus D for \u03a91 = 0.01, \u03a92 /\u03a91 = 2\nand A = 0.5 (crosses). Inset: h\u1e8bi versus \u03c62 for \u03c61 = 0,\nA = 0.5, and D = 1. Note the resonant behavior of h\u1e8bi for\nsubthreshold drives, A < 1, where a low noise level enhances\nrectification; increasing D for A > 1 degrades the rectification\neffect.\n\nthat a symmetric nonlinear device cannot mix rectangular waveforms, like\n\nF (t) = A1 sgn[cos(\u03a91 t+\u03c61 )]+A2 sgn[cos(\u03a92 t+\u03c62 )], (18)\n\nTo avoid interference with possible harmonic mixing effects we follow the prescription of Sec. II.C.1, namely we\ntake Fi (t) = Ai sgn[cos(\u03a9i t + \u03c6i )], i = 1, 2, with A1 > 0\nand 0 < A2 < 1. Mixing of the additive F1 (t) and the\nmultiplicative signal F2 (t) provides a control mechanism\nof potential interest in device design.\nIn the adiabatic limit, the Brownian particle moves\ncyclicly back and forth subjected to opposite dc forces\nwith amplitude A1 ; the substrate potential V (x, t) =\nV (x)[1 + F2 (t)] switches, in turn, periodically between\nthe two symmetric configurations V\u00b1 (x) = V (x)(1 \u00b1 A2 ).\nThe relevant mobilities \u03bc\u00b1 (A1 ) can be easily related to\nthe static mobility function \u03bc(A) for the tilted potential\nV (x) studied in Fig. 1, namely (Savel'ev et al., 2004a;\nSavel'ev et al., 2004)\n\u0014\n\u0015\nA1\n\u03bc\u00b1 (A1 ) = (1 \u00b1 A2 ) \u03bc\n,\n(20)\n1 \u00b1 A2\nwith T \u2192 T /(1 \u00b1 A2 ).\nIn particular, for any pair of commensurate frequencies\n\u03a91 and \u03a92 such that \u03a92 /\u03a91 = (2m \u2212 1)/(2n \u2212 1) (with\nm, n positive integers), the net particle velocity mediated\nover an integer number of cycles of both F1 (t) and F2 (t)\ncan be cast in the form\nh\u1e8bi = \u2212\n\nwith A1 , A2 \u2265 0 and sgn[. . . ] denoting the sign of [. . . ]\n(Savel'ev et al., 2004a; Savel'ev et al., 2004). As shown\nin Sec. II.D.4, asymmetric devices do not exhibit this peculiarity. Moreover, we underscore that for incommensurate frequencies, \u03a91 /\u03a92 not a rational number, harmonic\nmixing takes place only in the presence of spatial asymmetry, as reported in Sec. II.D.4.\nFor practical applications, any commensuration condition, like \u03a91 /\u03a92 = n/m for harmonic mixing (but see\nalso Secs. II.C.2 and II.D.4) is affected by an uncertainty\nthat is inverse proportional to the observation time, i.e.,\nthe code running time for numerical simulations or the\ndata recording time for real experiments. As such time\nis necessarily finite, only a limited number of commensuration spikes can be actually detected.\nWe conclude by reminding that the notion of harmonic\nmixing has been introduced long ago, e.g., to interpret\nthe output of certain charge wave density experiments\n(Schneider and Seeger, 1966) and to design laser ring\ngyroscopes (Chow et al., 1985) and annular Josephson\njunctions (Ustinov et al., 2004); applications in the context of nano-particle transport is more recent (see Secs.\nII.C.3 and IV).\n\n(19)\n\n(\u22121)m+n A1\n\u2206\u03bc(A1 , A2 ) p(\u2206n,m ),\n(2m \u2212 1)(2n \u2212 1)\n\n(21)\n\nwhere \u2206\u03bc(A1 , A2 ) = \u03bc\u2212 (A1 ) \u2212 \u03bc+ (A1 ) and p(\u2206n,m ) \u2261\n|\u03c0 \u2212 \u2206n,m |/\u03c0 \u2212 0.5 is a modulation factor with \u2206n,m =\n(2n\u22121)\u03c62 \u2212(2m\u22121)\u03c61 , mod(2\u03c0). Note that for different\nchoices of the ratio \u03a92 /\u03a91 , no induced drift is predicted\n(see Fig. 2).\nAs a consequence, a relatively small modulation of the\nsinusoidal potential amplitude at low temperatures results in a net transport current as illustrated in Fig. 2.\nLet us consider the simplest possible case, \u03a91 = \u03a92 and\n\u03c61 = \u03c62 : As the ac drive points to the right, the amplitude of V (x, t) is set at its maximum value \u03c902 (1+A2 ); at\nlow temperatures the Brownian particle can hardly overcome the substrate barriers within a half ac-drive period\n\u03c0/\u03a91 . In the subsequent half period F1 (t) switches to the\nleft, while the potential amplitude drops to its minimum\nvalue \u03c902 (1 \u2212 A2 ): The particle has a better chance to\nescape a potential well to the left than to the right, thus\ninducing a negative current with maximum intensity for\n\u03a91 of the order of the Kramers rate (resonant activation\n(Borromeo and Marchesoni, 2004)). Of course, amplitude and sign of the net current may be controlled via\nthe modulation parameters A2 and \u03c62 , too (see inset of\nFig. 2).\n\n\f10\n3. Noise induced transport\n\nInduced transport in the symmetric dynamics can be\nachieved also by employing two correlated noisy signals.\n(i) Noise mixing. Borromeo and Marchesoni (2004)\nshowed that the gating process in Eq. (19) can be driven\nalso by two stationary, zero-mean valued Gaussian noises,\nFi (t) = \u03b7i (t) with i = 1, 2. The two random drives may\nbe cross- and auto-correlated with\n\u0012\n\u0013\np\n|t|\n\u03bbij\nexp \u2212\n,\ni, j = 1, 2.\nh\u03b7i (t)\u03b7j (0)i = Qi Qj\n\u03c4ij\n\u03c4ij\n(22)\nWithout loss of generality, one sets \u03bb11 = \u03bb22 = 1 and\n\u03bb12 = \u03bb21 = \u03bb, and to avoid technical complications,\n\u03c4ij \u2261 \u03c4 . Of course \u03c4 \u2192 0 corresponds to taking the\nwhite noise limit of \u03b7i (t), Eq. (4). The parameter \u03bb\ncharacterizes the cross-correlation of the two signals; in\nparticular, \u03bb = 0: independent signals; \u03bb = 1: identical\nsignals, \u03b72 (t) \u2261 \u03b71 (t); \u03bb = \u22121: signals with reversed\nsign, \u03b72 (t) \u2261 \u2212\u03b71 (t). Two such signals may have been\ngenerated by a unique noise source and then partially\nde-correlated through different transmission or coupling\nmechanisms.\nIn the white noise limit, \u03c4 \u2192 0, the Fokker-Planck\nequation associated with the process of Eqs. (19) and\n(22) admits of a stationary solution in closed form. Nonvanishing values of h\u1e8bi for \u03bb 6= 0 are the signature of\na stochastic symmetry breaking due to nonlinear noise\nmixing; the sign of \u03bb, similarly to the relative phase \u2206m,n\nin the gating set-up of Sec. II.C.2, determines the direction of the particle drift. The interpretation of this result\nis straightforward. Let us consider, for instance, the case\nof the symmetric potential in Eq. (5), rocked and pulsated by the same signal, i.e., \u03b71 (t) = \u03b72 (t): For \u03bb = 1,\nwhen pushed to the left (\u03b7i < 0), the Brownian particle\nencounters lower substrate barriers than when pushed\nto the right (\u03b7i > 0), hence the negative average drift\ncurrent detected by means of numerical simulation (Borromeo et al., 2006; Borromeo and Marchesoni, 2005b).\nThe magnitude of the induced current is controlled\nby the correlation time \u03c4 (Borromeo and Marchesoni,\n2005b). While one can easily estimate h\u1e8bi for \u03bb 6= 0\nand \u03c4 = 0 (white noise (Risken, 1984)) or \u03c4 \u2192 \u221e\n(strongly correlated noise (H\u00e4nggi et al., 1989)), the\nintermediate \u03c4 values are accessible solely through\nnumerical simulation. In Fig. 3(a) we report h\u1e8bi versus\n\u03c4 for different noise intensities: the two sets of curves at\nQ and Q/\u03c4 fixed, illustrate well the noise mixing effect\nfor \u03c4 \u2192 0 and \u03c4 \u2192 \u221e, respectively.\n(ii) Noise recycling. If the noises \u03b7i (t) are generated by\nthe same source and then coupled to the diffusing particle\nthrough different paths, it may well happen that they are\nsimply delayed in time. Under stationary conditions, we\ncan assume that \u03b72 (t) = \u03b71 (t \u2212 \u03c4d ), with \u03b7i (t) given in\nEq. (22) and, for simplicity, \u03bb = 0. In the notation of\nRefs. (Borromeo et al., 2006; Borromeo and Marchesoni,\n2007b), \u03b71 (t) represents the primary noise source and\n\nFIG. 3 (Color online) Equation (19), with Fi (t) = \u03b7i (t),\ni = 1, 2, and V (x) = \u2212 sin x, has been simulated numerically;\nthe noises \u03b7i (t), Eq. (22), have same strength, Q1 = Q2 = Q.\nAfter Borromeo and Marchesoni (2005b): (a) Nonlinear noise\nmixing: Characteristics curve h\u1e8bi-\u03c4 for different intensities\nQ of the noises and \u03bb = 1; D = 0.1. (b) Noise recycling:\nCharacteristics curve v-\u03c4d , where \u03c4d is the relative time delay\nof \u03b7i (see text). Data are for different \u03c4 and Q = 1; D = 0,\nsee in Borromeo et al. (2006).\n\n\u03b72 (t) a recycled noise to be used as a control signal.\nBy the same argument as for noise mixing, we expect\nthat the Brownian dynamics gets rectified to the left with\nnegative velocity h\u1e8b(\u03c4d )i. Note that: h\u1e8b(\u2212\u03c4d )i = h\u1e8b(\u03c4d )i\nand h\u1e8b(\u03c4d )i \u2192 \u2212h\u1e8b(\u03c4d )i, upon changing the relative signs\nof \u03b7i . The dependence of the characteristic curve h\u1e8b(\u03c4d )i\non the time constants \u03c4d and \u03c4 displayed in Fig. 3(b),\nis important in view of practical applications. Indeed,\nin many circumstances, it would be extremely difficult\nto recycle a control signal \u03b72 (t) so that \u03c4d \u001c \u03c4 ; stated\notherwise, measuring h\u1e8b(0)i requires a certain degree of\nexperimental sophistication. On the contrary, if we agree\nto work on the resonant tail of its response curve |h\u1e8b(\u03c4d )i|,\na noise controlled rectification device can be operated\nwith less effort; its net output current may be not the\nhighest for \u03c4d > \u03c4 , but is still appreciable and, more\nimportantly, stable against the accidental floating of the\ntime constant \u03c4d .\nIn this sense both schemes discussed in this section are\na simple-minded attempt at implementing the operation\nof a Maxwell's daemon: The ideal device we set up is intended to gauge the primary random signal \u03b71 at the sampling time t and, depending on the sign of each reading,\nto lower or raise the gate barriers accordingly at a later\n\n\f11\ntime t + \u03c4d , i.e., open or close the trap door. The rectifying power of such a daemon is far from optimal; lacking\nthe dexterity of Maxwell's \"gate-keeper\" (Leff and Rex,\n2003; Maruyama et al., 2008), it only works \"in average\"\nlike an automaton.\n\nD. Brownian motors\n\nAs detailed in Sec. II.B, a necessary condition for the\nrectification of symmetric signals, random or periodic in\ntime, alike, is the spatial asymmetry of the substrate.\nRectification devices involving asymmetric substrates are\ntermed ratchets. In most such devices, however, noise\n(no matter what its source, i.e. stochastic, or chaotic,\nor thermal) plays a non-negligible, or even the dominant\nrole. Under such conditions one speaks of Brownian motors (Astumian, 1997; Astumian and H\u00e4nggi, 2002; Bartussek and H\u00e4nggi, 1995; H\u00e4nggi and Bartussek, 1996;\nH\u00e4nggi et al., 2005, 2002; Kay et al., 2007; Linke, 2002;\nReimann et al., 1996). The label Brownian motor should\nnot be abused to refer to all small ratchet-like devices.\nFor instance, the rocked ratchets of Sec. II.D.1 work\nquite differently in the presence or in the absence of noise,\nwhereas the pulsated and correlation ratchets (sometimes\nalso referred to as \"stochastic\" ratchets) of Secs. II.D.2\nand II.D.3 work only in the presence of noise.\nThe hallmarks of genuine Brownian motors are listed in\nSec. I. In this Section we discuss in detail noise rectification and directed transport on asymmetric periodic substrates and potentials. We caution the reader that: (1)\nStrict periodicity is not a requirement for the operation\nof a Brownian motor. The ratchet system may contain\nsmall amounts of disorder (Harms and Lipowsky, 1997;\nKafri and Nelson, 2005; Martinez and Chacon, 2008;\nPopescu et al., 2000) or even be non-periodic (Marchesoni, 1997); (2) Spatial asymmetry can also result as\na collective effect, for instance, in the extended systems\nconsisting of interacting, symmetric dynamical components, introduced in Sec. V.\nThe archetypal model of ratchet substrates in 1D is the\ndouble-sine potential proposed by Bartussek et al. (1994)\n\u0014 \u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\u0015\n2\u03c0x\n1\n4\u03c0x\nV (x) = \u2212V0 sin\n+ sin\n,\nL\n4\nL\n\n(23)\n\nor, in the rescaled units of Eq. (6), V (x) = \u2212\u03c902 [sin x +\n1\n4 sin(2x)]. In the sketch of Fig. 4, the barriers are skewed\nto the right with ratchet length l+ > l\u2212 . A Brownian particle with Langevin equation (1) moving on such a substrate is characterized by an asymmetric mobility function, \u03bc(F ) 6= \u03bc(\u2212F ); as the particle mobility depends\nnow not only on the amplitude, but also on the orientation of the drive F , symmetric substrate perturbations\nare expected to induce a net current in either direction.\nBroadly speaking, ratchet devices fall into three categories depending on how the applied perturbation couples to the substrate asymmetry.\n\nFIG. 4 (Color online) Ratchet mechanism. (a) Sketch of the\npotential in Eq. (23) with L = 1 and V0 = L/2\u03c0. The\nthree consecutive extremal points, x\u2212 = \u22120.19, x0 = 0.19\nand x+ = 0.81, define a potential well; the barrier height\nis \u2206V = V (x\u00b1 ) \u2212 V (x0 ) ' 0.35 and its asymmetry is\nquantified by the difference l+ \u2212 l\u2212 with l\u00b1 = |x\u00b1 \u2212 x0 |.\nThe curvature\nof the potential at the bottom of the well is\n\u221a\n\u03c9 20 = (3 3/2)\u03c902 ' 10.1. (b) Rocket ratchet. Probability density p(x, t) for a Brownian particle initially centered\naround x = 0 (red) and then driven for t = 10 by a dc force\nA0 = \u22120.5 (green) and 0.5 (grey). The backward displacement is strongly suppressed, hence the positive natural orientation of this ratchet. (c) Pulsated ratchet. The ratchet potential is switched \"on\" and \"off\" periodically with ton = 1,\ntoff = 3 and T2 = ton + toff (see text). The particle, initially set at x = x0 , relaxes first in the starting well during\nton (curve 1, red, t1 = ton ), then diffuses symmetrically only\ndriven by noise for toff (curve 2, blue, t2 = T2 ), and finally\ngets retrapped in the neighboring wells as the next cycle begins (curve 3, green, t3 = T2 + ton ). As the left side peak of\np(x, t3 ) is more pronounced than the right peak, the natural\norientation of this ratchet is negative. In the simulations of\n(b) and (c) the ratchet potential V (x) is the same as in (a)\n(also drawn to guide the eye) and the intensity of the noise\nin Eq. (4) is D = 0.1\u2206V . Courtesy of Marcello Borromeo.\n\n1. Rocked ratchets\n\nLet us consider first, for simplicity, the Langevin equation (3) with the sinusoidal drive of Eq. (8). When applied to the reflection-symmetric sine potential of Eq.\n(5), F (t) breaks instantaneously the symmetry of the\npotential by tilting it to the right for F (t) > 0, and\nto the left for F (t) < 0. However, due to the spatio-\n\n\f12\ntemporal symmetry of the process, V (x) = V (\u2212x) and\nF (t) = F (\u2212t), over one drive cycle, T1 = 2\u03c0/\u03a91 , the\ndrift to the right and to the left compensate one another:\nthe net current is null. When placed in the double-sine\npotential of Eq. (23), instead, an overdamped particle is\napparently more movable to the right than to the left. Indeed, depinning occurs at F = F3R = 3/4 and F = \u2212F3L\nfor F (t) oriented respectively to the right and to the left;\nmoreover from the asymmetry condition l+ > l\u2212 folows\nimmediately the inequality F3R < F3L . The depinning\nthresholds of the potential of Eq. (23) in the rescaled\nunits of Eq. (6) are F3R = 3/4 and F3L = 3/2.\nIf the forcing frequency \u03a91 is taken much smaller than\nall the intrawell relaxation constants, \u03c902 T1 \u001d 1 and\nT1 \u001d ht(L, 0)i, than the net transport current can be\ncomputed in the adiabatic approximation by averaging\nthe instantaneous velocity \u1e8b(t) = \u03bc[F (t)]F (t), see Eq.\n(7), over one forcing cycle, that is (Bartussek et al., 1994;\nBorromeo et al., 2002)\nZ T1\nh\u1e8bi\n1\nsgn[F (s)]\n=\nds.\n(24)\nj\u2261\nL\nT1 0 ht[L, F (s)]i\nThe adiabatic current in Eq. (24) is positive definite,\nas the natural ratchet direction is defined by the choice\nF3R < F3L . However, its range of validity is restricted\nto extremely low temperatures T and drive frequencies\n\u03a91 . On raising \u03a91 , the rectification current develops a\nmore complicated dependence on the noise intensity D\nand the drive amplitude A1 , as proven by the numerical\nsimulations reported in panels (a)-(c) of Fig. 5. This is\ndue to the fact that for forcing periods T1 shorter than\nthe mean first-passage time ht(L, 0)i, the driven particle oscillations span over fewer substrate cells. A few\nproperties of the rocked ratchet current in Fig. 5 are remarkable:\n(a) At finite temperature, the maximum rectification effect occurs right in the adiabatic regime, \u03a91 \u2192 0, and\nwith natural orientation, panels (a) and (b);\n(b) For \u03a91 > \u03c90 , the drive and the interwell oscillations may combine to reverse the current orientation.\nSuch current inversions are restricted to select D and\nA1 ranges, but never in the absence of noise, panel (a)\nand (b);\n(c) In the noiseless regime, T \u2261 0, the incommensuration\nbetween forced oscillation amplitude and substrate periodicity causes the quantized locking structure of panel\n(c). Such a structure disappears either in the limit\n\u03a91 \u2192 0, as the forced oscillation amplitude grows infinitely large, or in the presence of noise, when, due to\nrandomness, the finer steps for A1 > F3L merge into the\nbroad oscillations of panel (b);\n(d) As the temperature vanishes, the adiabatic current\nin Eq. (24) gets suppressed for A1 < F3R and enhanced\nelsewhere [see Fig. 8(a)]. For F3R < A1 < F3L the particle can only move to the right, so that j grows almost\nlinearly with A1 , while for A1 > F3L the particle can\ndrift in both directions, thus making j decrease.\nRectifiers, like a rocked ratchet, can work against an\n\nFIG. 5 Rocked ratchet. Rectification current j versus the\nnoise intensity D, see Eq. (4), panel (a), and versus ac modulation strength A \u2261 A1 , panels (b) and (c) for the ratchet\npotential in Eq. (23) with L = 1. The relevant simulation\nparameters are: (a) A1 = 0.5 and \u03a91 = 0.01, 1, 2.5, 4 and\n7 (top to bottom); (b) D = 0.1 and \u03a91 = 0.01, 1, 4 and 7\n(top to bottom). In both panels (a) and (b) the solid line for\n\u03a91 = 0.01 coincides with the adiabatic limit in Eq.

On adding a dc component A0 to the\nsinusoidal force, namely, on applying the drive (9) instead of (8), we can determine the value of A0 , termed\nstopping force, such that for a certain choice of the other\nperturbation parameters, A1 , \u03a91 and D, the net current\nvanishes.\nRocked ratchets with massive particles exhibit strong\n\n\f13\ninertial effects also capable of reversing their current. A\nnoiseless inertial rocked ratchet is naturally subject to\ndeveloping chaotic dynamics; indeed, its current turns\nout to be extremely sensitive to the initial conditions\n(Borromeo et al., 2002; Jung et al., 1996; Machura et al.,\n2007a; Mateos, 2000, 2003). However, an appropriate\nnoise level suffices to stabilize the rectification properties\nof an inertial ratchet and makes it a useful device with potential applications in science and technology (Machura\net al., 2004b; Marchesoni et al., 2006a).\nIn the notation of Sec. II.A.1, slightly generalized\nto account for the asymmetry of the potential in Eq.\n(23), we define two additional pairs of thresholds, besides\nthe depinning thresholds F3R,L : the repinning thresholds\nF1R,L and the underdamped transition thresholds F2R,L ,\nwith FiR < FiL for i = 1, 2, 3 [the suffix R, L denoting\nthe orientation of the drive]. Under the adiabatic condition \u03a91 \u001c \u03b3, \u03c90 , the following approximations have been\nobtained in Borromeo et al. (2002); Marchesoni et al.\n(2006a):\n(a) in the zero-temperature limit, T \u2192 0:\nj(A1 ) = jR (A1 ),\nF2R < A1 < F2L\n= jR (A1 ) \u2212 jL (A1 )\nA1 > F2L (25)\nand j(A1 ) = 0 for A1 < F2R\nq. The right/left current\n2\ncomponents are jR,L (A1 ) = 2 A21 \u2212 F2R,L\n/(\u03c0\u03b3L).\n(b) in the noiseless regime, T \u2261 0:\nj(A1 ) = jR (A1 ),\nF3R < A1 < F3L\n= jR (A1 ) \u2212 jL (A1 ),\nA1 > F3L (26)\nand\nq j(A1 ) = 0 qfor A1 < F3R . Here, jR,L (A1 ) =\n2\n2\n[ A21 \u2212 F1R,L\n+ A21 \u2212 F3R,L\n]/(\u03c0\u03b3L). Note that j(A1 )\nin Eq. (26) is discontinuous at the depinning thresholds F3R,L as expected for the response curve of any underdamped rocked ratchet operated in the deterministic\nregime (see Sec. II.A.1).\n\nRectification by a pulsated ratchet can be explained\nqualitatively by looking at the cartoon of Fig. 6. The\nprobability density of a particle initially placed at the\nbottom of a potential well (top), is mostly confined to\nthat well, as long as T2 /2 is not exceedingly longer than\nthe escape time ht(L, 0)i, which is the case at low temperatures. When, during the following half cycle, the\nsubstrate is switched off (middle), the particle, still subject to noise, diffuses freely with Einstein's constant D\nand, for T2 \u001d L2 /D, its probability density approaches\na Gaussian spanning over many a unit cell. By switching\non again, the substrate cuts such a probability density\ninto smaller peaks of different size, one for each well surrounding the initial one. For potential barriers skewed\nlike in figure, l+ > l\u2212 , wells on the right are expected to\nbe more populated than wells on the left, hence a positive\nnet current. This is also the case of the potential in Eq.\n(23), which has positive natural orientation when pulsated, and negative orientation when rocked. The mechanism illustrated in Fig. 6 can work even in the presence\nof dc force, F1 (t) = A0 , pointing in the opposite direction, A0 < 0. Such an upward directed motion is clearly\npowered by the thermal fluctuations \u03be(t).\nThe directed particle current is clearly bound to vanish\nin the adiabatic limit, \u03a92 \u2192 0, when thermal equilibrium\nis approached. A similar conclusion holds true for very\nfast substrate modulations, \u03a92 \u001d \u03c902 (in rescaled units).\nIn perturbation analysis (Savel'ev et al., 2004c), one finds\nthe noteworthy result that the current decays to zero in\nboth asymptotic regimes remarkably fast, namely like \u03a922\nin the slow modulation limit, and \u03a922 , in the fast modulation limit respectively. Moreover, for intermediate modulation frequencies, the current in a pulsated ratchet is\ngenerally not oriented in its natural direction; current inversions are possible when the forcing frequency matches\nsome intrinsic relaxation rate of the process.\n\n2. Pulsated ratchets\n\nLet us consider now the overdamped process of Eq.\n(19) with F1 (t) = 0 and F2 (t) = A2 sgn[cos(\u03a92 t + \u03c62 )].\nAs discussed in Sec. II.C.2, modulating the amplitude of\na symmetric potential V (x) in the presence of an uncorrelated, time-symmetric perturbation \u03be(t) does not suffices\nto induce rectification. This state of affair changes when\nF2 (t) couples, instead, to an asymmetric substrate, like\nour reference ratchet potential (23). For the sake of simplicity, we set A2 = 1, so that the effective substrate\npotential [1 + F2 (t)]V (x) appears to switch on and off at\nevery half period T2 /2 = \u03c0/\u03a92 . The interplay between\ntime modulation and spatial asymmetry generates a nonzero drift current, which, at low (but not too low!) frequencies, is oriented in the positive direction. Devices\noperated under similar conditions are termed pulsated\nratchets.\n\nFIG. 6 (Color online) Pulsated ratchet.

Courtesy of Marcello Borromeo.\n\nFinally, pulsated ratchets can be operated under very\n\n\f14\ngeneral amplitude modulations F2 (t), as well. This\nratchet effect proved robust with respect to (a) modifications of the potential shape (Reimann, 2002); (b) changes\nin the switching sequence. A generic discrete modulation signal F2 (t) is characterized by different residence\ntimes, namely, ton in the \"on\" state, +A2 , and toff in the\n\"off\" state, \u2212A2 , respectively. For periodic modulations,\nton + toff = T2 defines the so-called duty cycle of the device (Ajdari and Prost, 1992; Bug and Berne, 1987); for\nrandom modulations, instead, ton and toff must be interpreted as the average residence times in the respective\n\"on\", \"off\" state (Astumian and Bier, 1994; Faucheux\net al., 1995). In both cases the modulation is asymmetric\nfor ton 6= toff ; (c) replacement of pulsated with flashing\nsubstrates. The substrate is made switch, either periodically or randomly in time, among two or more discrete\nconfigurations, which do not result from the amplitude\nmodulation of a unique substrate profile (Borromeo and\nMarchesoni, 1998; Chen, 1997; Gorman et al., 1996; Lee\net al., 2004). The rectification process is controlled by the\nspatial asymmetry of the single substrate configurations\nor by the temporal asymmetry of the switching sequence,\nor by a combination of both; (d) modulation of the temperature (Bao, 1999; Reimann et al., 1996). Modulating\nthe intensity of the ambient noise \u03be(t) or its coupling\nto the device, corresponds to introducing the time dependent temperature T (t) = [1 + F2 (t)]T , for an appropriate control signal F2 (t) with amplitude smaller than\none. Pulsating the potential amplitude V0 or the temperature T yield very similar rectification effects, being\nthe net current of a pulsated ratchet mostly controlled by\nthe barrier-to-noise ratio; (e) the addition of constant or\nspatially modulated damping terms (Luchsinger (2000);\nSuzuki and Munakata (2003); see also Reimann (2002)).\nInertial effects make the rectification mechanism sensitive to the particle mass, so that selective transport and\nsegregation of mixed species becomes possible (Der\u00e9nyi\nand Ajdari, 1996; Der\u00e9nyi and Vicsek, 1995).\n3. Correlation ratchets\n\nTo better understand the role of asymmetry in the rectification of a nonequilibrium process, we consider now\nan overdamped Brownian particle with Langevin equation (3) diffusing in the ratchet potential of Eq. (23)\nsubject to a zero-mean, colored Gaussian noise F \u2261 \u03b7(t),\nwith\n\u0012\n\u0013\nQ\n|t|\nh\u03b7(t)\u03b7(0)i = exp \u2212\n.\n(27)\n\u03c4\n\u03c4\nThe substrate asymmetry is capable per se of rectifying\nthe correlated fluctuation \u03b7(t), even in the absence of\nexternal modulations or thermal noise. The early prediction of this transport effect, based on simple perturbation\narguments (Bartussek et al., 1994; Doering et al., 1994;\nLuczka et al., 1995; Magnasco, 1993; Millonas and Dykman, 1994), kindled a widespread interest in the thermodynamics of molecular motors. A more sophisticated\n\npath-integral analysis (Bartussek et al., 1996) led later\nto the following low-noise estimates of the correlation\nratchet current:\n(a) in the weak color limit, \u03c902 \u03c4 \u001c 1,\nj(\u03c4 ) = j+ (\u03c4 ) \u2212 j\u2212 (\u03c4 ),\n\n(28)\n\nwhere j\u00b1 (\u03c4 ) = rK exp[\u2212\u03c4 2 Qc\u00b1 /(D + Q)2 ] and rK is the\nequilibrium Kramers rate for the particle to exit a potential well through one side, rK = \u03c9 0 \u03c9\u00b1 exp[\u2212\u2206V /(D +\nQ)]/(2\u03c0). Here, x0 and x\u00b1 are the extremal points of\n2\nV (x) defined\nFig. 4; \u03c9 20 = V 00 (x0 ), \u03c9\u00b1\n= |V 00 (x\u00b1 )|,\nR x\u00b1as in\n00\n0\nand c\u00b1 = x0 [V (x)]V (x)dx;\n(b) in the strong color limit, \u03c4 \u2192 \u221e,\n\u0013\u0015\n\u0014\n\u0012\nQL\nj(\u03c4 ) = j0 1 \u2212 exp \u2212 2 (l+ \u2212 l\u2212 ) , (29)\n2D \u03c4\nwhere j0 is a positive definite constant. Equation (28)\ncan be regarded as the difference of two exit currents\nj\u00b1 (\u03c4 ), respectively through x+ (forward) and x\u2212 (backward), in the presence of colored noise (Millonas and\nDykman, 1994).\n\nFIG. 7 Correlation ratchet.

(1996).\n\nThe orientation of the current of a correlation ratchet\nis extremely sensitive to the substrate geometry. In the\nstrong color limit, the condition (l+ \u2212l\u2212 ) > 0 between the\ntwo ratchet lengths guarantees that the current is positive, no matter what the choice of V (x); all correlation\nratchets work in the natural direction of the corresponding rocked ratchet.\nIn the weak color limit, the current in Eq. (28) has the\nRL\nsame sign as the difference c\u2212 \u2212 c+ = 0 [V 00 (x)]V 0 (x)dx,\nwhich, in turn, depends on the detailed profile of V (x),\nregardless of sgn[l+ \u2212 l\u2212 ]. Numerical simulation of correlation ratchets with potential given in Eq. (23), confirmed that, consistently with the inequality c\u2212 \u2212 c+ > 0,\nj(\u03c4 ) is positive definite, as illustrated in Fig. 7; as\nj(\u03c4 \u2192 0) = j(\u03c4 \u2192 \u221e) = 0, optimal rectification\nis achieved for an intermediate noise correlation time,\n\u03c902 \u03c4 \u223c 1.

After Borromeo and Marchesoni (2005b).\n\nan appropriate higher order Fourier component without\nchanging l+ \u2212 l\u2212 , suffices to reverse the sign of c\u2212 \u2212 c+\nand, thus, introduce at least one current inversion (Bartussek et al., 1996).\nCorrelation ratchets have the potential for technological applications to \"noise harvesting\", rather than to\nnano-particle transport. The low current output and its\nextreme sensitivity to the substrate geometry and the\nparticle mass (Lindner et al., 1999; Marchesoni, 1998)\nmakes the design and operation of correlation ratchets\nas mass rectifiers questionable. However, the asymmetry induced rectification of nonequilibrium fluctuations,\nno matter how efficient and hard to control, can be exploited by a small device to extract from its environment\nand store the power it needs to operate.\n\n4. Further asymmetry effects\n\nThe rectification mechanisms introduced in Sec. II.C\napply to any periodic substrate, independently of its spatial symmetry. In the presence of spatial asymmetry, the\n\nrelevant drift currents get modified as follows:\n(i) Current off-sets. At variance with Secs. II.C.1 and\nII.C.2, two ac drives applied to an asymmetric device\nare expected to induce a net current javg = h\u1e8biavg also\nfor incommensurate frequencies \u03a91 , \u03a92 . This is a mere\nratchet effect that in most experiments is handled as a\nsimple current off-set. This conclusion is apparent, for\ninstance, in the case of low-frequency rectangular input\nwaves, where the device output current can be expressed\nas a linear combination of two known ratchet currents\n(Savel'ev et al., 2004a; Savel'ev et al., 2004), namely:\n(a) Harmonic mixing current (Sec. II.C.1). When the\ndrive is a double rectangular wave, Eq. (18), javg can\nbe regarded as the incoherent superposition of currents\nfrom two rocked ratchets driven by rectangular waves\nwith amplitudes A1 + A2 and |A1 \u2212 A2 |, respectively, i.e.\njavg =\n\n1\n[j0 (|A1 \u2212 A2 |) + j0 (A1 + A2 )];\n2\n\n(30)\n\n(b) Gating current (Sec. II.C.2). The rocked-pulsated\ndevice of Eq. (19) can be regarded as the incoherent\nsuperposition of two ratchets with potentials V\u00b1 (x) =\n\n\f16\n(1 \u00b1 A2 )V (x), respectively, both rocked with amplitude\nA1 ; hence\njavg =\n\n1\n[j+ (A1 ) + j\u2212 (A1 )].\n2\n\n(31)\n\nIn Eqs. (30) and (31) j0,\u00b1 (A) are the net currents of Eq.\n(24) for a rocked ratchet driven by a rectangular wave\nwith amplitude A and vanishing frequency, the suffixes\n0, \u00b1 referring to the regular, high/low amplitude potential configurations, V (x) and V\u00b1 (x).\n(ii) Asymmetry induced mixing. As anticipated in Sec.\nII.C.1, a double rectangular wave is not capable of rectifying a Brownian particle in a symmetric potential,\nthat is, h\u1e8bi = 0 also under harmonic mixing conditions,\n\u03a92 /\u03a91 = m/n with m, n coprime integers and m + n\nodd. This is no more the case if V (x) is asymmetric.\nThe non-zero odd moments of the process x(t), determined by the substrate asymmetry, generate additional\nharmonic couplings of the \"odd\" harmonics of the drive,\ni.e., for \u03a92 /\u03a91 = (2m \u2212 1)/(2n \u2212 1) with 2m \u2212 1 and\n2n \u2212 1 coprime, as shown in Fig. 8. The total rectification current, including both the incommensurate term of\nEq. (30) and this new harmonic mixing spikes, was calculated analytically in Savel'ev et al. (2004a); Savel'ev\net al. (2004):\nj = javg \u2212\n\n(\u22121)m+n p(\u2206n,m )\njodd ,\n(2m \u2212 1)(2n \u2212 1)\n\n(32)\n\nwhere p(\u2206n,m ) is defined after Eq. (21) and jodd =\n1\n2 [j0 (|A1 \u2212 A2 |) \u2212 j0 (A1 + A2 )].\nThe competition between current off-set, item (i), and\nasymmetry induced spikes, item (ii), may cause surprising current reversals for special values of the driving frequencies, as observed in several experimental setups (cf.\nSecs. III, IV and VII.B). Moreover, replacing the rectangular waveform, Eq. (18), with a more conventional linear superposition of two sinusoids of the same frequency,\nEq. (16), leads to an even more complicated interplay\nof nonlinearity and asymmetry induced harmonic mixing\n(Savel'ev et al., 2004a). A special limit of bi-harmonically\ndriven rocked ratchet is discussed in Sec. II.E.2.\nA brilliant demonstration of the combination of harmonic mixing and asymmetry effects in the context of\nparticle transport at the nanoscales, has been recently reported by Kalman et al. (2007), who managed to drive dilute ions through conical nanopores by applying a biharmonic rectangular voltage. Harmonic mixing and gating\ncurrents could be separated, as predicted by the theory,\nand the resulting commensuration effects are displayed\nin Fig. 9.\n\nE. Efficiency and control issues\n\nThe analysis of Sec. II.D suggests that the output of a\nreal ratchet device is hard to control experimentally, let\nalone to predict. As a matter of fact, if we use a ratchet\n\nFIG. 9 (Color online) Net current through a single conical\nnanopore for the sum of two voltage signals applied across\nthe pore, 0.5sgn[sin(\u03a91 t)]+0.5sgn[sin(\u03a92 t+\u03c0)], with different\n\u03a92 /\u03a91 . The measurements were taken in a 0.1M KCl solution\nat pH 8.0. For further details see Kalman et al. (2007).\n\nto rectify an assigned signal, the only tunable variables\nare the temperature T , the damping constant \u03b3 (or the\nmass m), and the substrate profile V (x). Under certain\nexperimental circumstances these quantities may prove\nnot directly accessible to this purpose or inconvenient to\nchange. This is why control of particle transport in small\ndevices sometimes requires introducing auxiliary signals,\nauxiliary particle species (Sec. V.C), or even the use of a\nfeedback control scheme to optimize the Brownian motor\ncurrent (Craig et al., 2008a,b; Feito and Cao, 2007, 2008;\nSon et al., 2008).\n1. Optimization\n\nThe most common definition of efficiency for a loaded\nBrownian motor is\n\u03b70 = h\u1e8biA0 /hP iin ,\n\n(33)\n\nwhere h\u1e8biA0 is the average mechanical work done per\nunit of time against a working load A0 and hP iin is the\naverage net power pumped into the system by the external drives, no matter how applied. The quantity \u03b70\nhas been interpreted in terms of macroscopic thermodynamics by Sekimoto (1998) (for further developments\non issues of energetics and efficiency see also Parrondo\nand de Cisneros (2002)), and references therein. In their\nscheme, a ratchet operates like a Carnot cycle, where the\nlower temperature is determined by the thermal noise,\nEqs. (2 and 4), and the higher temperature is related\nto the magnitude of the external modulation. Operating\nfar from thermal equilibrium, the efficiency is typically\nsmaller than the upper limit of a thermal reversibly operating Carnot cycle.\nThe ensuing question, whether a ratchet can be operated at the maximal Carnot efficiency, spurred an intense\ndebate (see for a review, Sec. 6.9 in Reimann (2002)).\nThe issue has been clarified by an analysis performed\nwithin the validity regime of the framework of linear irreversible thermodynamics by den Broeck (2007): The key\n\n\f17\ntowards obtaining maximal Carnot efficiency for a Brownian motor is zero overall entropy production. This can\nbe achieved by use of architectural constraints for which\nthe (linear) Onsager matrix has a determinant equal to\nzero, implying vanishing (linear) irreversible heat fluxes.\nMaximizing efficiency subject to \"maximum power\" also\nleads to the same condition of a vanishing determinant\nof the Onsager matrix (i.e perfect coupling) (den Broeck,\n2005), yielding the Curzon-Ahlborn limit (Curzon and\nAhlborn, 1975), which in turn at small temperature difference just yields half the Carnot efficiency. For the\narchetype Smoluchowski-Feynman Brownian motor device (Feynman et al., 1963; Smoluchowski, 1912) the efficiency at maximum power has recently been evaluated\nfor different coupling schemes by Tu (2008): Interestingly enough, the typical upper bound set by Curzon\nand Ahlborn (1975) can then even be surpassed.\nIn spite of the combined efforts of theorists and experimenters, as of today the question remains unanswered.\nAt present, ratchet devices operating under controllable\nexperimental conditions hardly achieve an efficiency \u03b70\nlarger than a few percent.\nOn the other hand, definition (33) of efficiency is not\nalways adequate to determine the optimal performance\nof a Brownian motor. Firstly, \u03b70 assumes that work is\nbeing done against a load A0 , which is not always the\ncase. For example, one clearly finds a vanishing efficiency whenever no load A0 ) is present. Secondly, the\nonly transport quantifier used in Eq. (33) is the drift\nvelocity hvi, whereas the fluctuations of \u1e8b(t) = v(t), i.e.,\nthe variance \u03c3v2 = hv 2 i \u2212 hvi2 , are also of practical importance. Note that in this Section we use v(t) to denote\nthe particle velocity in Eq. (6) as a proper stochastic\nprocess. If \u03c3v > hvi, and even more so if \u03c3v \u001d hvi, the\nBrownian motor can possibly move for some time against\nits drift direction hvi.\nA load-independent rectification efficiency, \u03b7r , has\nbeen introduced by Suzuki and Munakata (2003) and\nthen generalized by Machura et al. (2004b). They computed \u03b7r as the ratio of the dissipated power associated\nwith the directed motion of the motor against both the\nfriction and the load, and the input power from the timeperiodic forcing. The result assumes the explicit form\n\u03b7r =\n\nhvi(A0 + hvi)\n,\n+ hviA0 \u2212 D0 |\n\n|hv 2 i\n\n(34)\n\nwhere D0 is the free diffusion coefficient of Sec. II.A.3.\nThis definition holds evidently also for A0 = 0, while numerical evidence indicates that hv 2 i \u2265 D0 , consistently\nwith the inequality \u03b7r \u2264 1. Note that the definition (34)\nassumes that x(t) is a damped process with finite \u03b3 (no\nmatter how large). In this way \u03b7r accounts explicitly also\nfor the power dissipated as velocity fluctuations during\nthe rectification process; in particular, it increases upon\ndecreasing \u03c3v . Machura et al. (2004b) noticed that, for\na rocked ratchet, \u03c3v exhibits pronounced peaks in correspondence with the rectification thresholds F3R,L (large\ndamping) and F2R,L (low damping), where the diffusion\n\ncoefficient also has a maximum (Sec. II.A.3). That lead\nto the general conclusion that transport by a Brownian\nmotor can be optimized by operating away from activation thresholds, in regimes of large net currents, where\nthe velocity fluctuations are intrinsically small.\n\nFIG. 10 (Color online) Mobility versus A2 /\u03a92 for a vibrated\nratchet with A1 = 0.5, \u03a91 = 0.01, \u03c61 = \u03c62 = 0, and different\nvalues of the noise intensity D (see legend, main panel).

After Borromeo\nand Marchesoni (2005a).\n\n2. Vibrated ratchets\n\nBesides the remarkable exceptions presented in Sec.\nIV, transport control in a rocked ratchet cannot be obtained experimentally by deforming the substrate potential \"on demand\". As shown by Borromeo and Marchesoni (2005a), this goal can more easily be achieved by\nmeans of an external tunable signal. Let V (x) be assigned a fixed profile, say, the standard double-sine in Eq.\n(23). The ratchet current can be still varied by injecting an additional control signal with frequency \u03a92 , that\nis, by replacing the harmonic drive in Eq. (8) with the\nbi-harmonic drive in Eq. (16); in the adiabatic regime\n\u03a92 \u001d \u03a91 the system response is very different than in\nSec. II.D.4. A rocked ratchet operated under such conditions is termed vibrational ratchet.\nFollowing the perturbation approach of Baltan\u00e1s et al.\n(2003); Bleckman (2000); Landa and McClintock (2000),\nthe variable x(t) in Eq. (3) can be separated as\nx(t) \u2212\u2192 x(t) + \u03c8(t): in the remainder of this Section x(t) will represent a slowly time-modulated stochastic process and \u03c8(t) the particle free spatial oscillation\n\n\f18\n\u03c8(t) = \u03c80 sin(\u03a92 t + \u03c62 ), with \u03c80 = A2 /\u03a92 . On averaging\nout \u03c8(t) over time, the Langevin equation for the slow\nreduced spatial variable x(t) can be written as\n0\n\n\u1e8b = \u2212V (x) + A1 cos(\u03a91 t + \u03c61 ) + \u03be(t),\n\n(35)\n\nwhere\n\u0014\n\u0015\n1\nV (x) = \u2212V0 J0 (\u03c80 ) sin x + J0 (2\u03c80 ) sin 2x\n4\n\n(36)\n\nand J0 (x) is the Bessel function of zero-th order. The\nsymmetry of the effective vibrated potential (35) is restored if one of its Fourier components vanishes, namely\nfor A2 /\u03a92 = 12 j1 , j1 , 12 j2 , 12 j3 , j2 , 12 j4 , 12 j5 , j3 , . . . , where\nj1 = 2.405, j2 = 5.520, j3 = 8.654, j4 = 11.79,\nj5 = 14.93 . . . , are the ordered zeros of the function\nJ0 (x); correspondingly, the ratchet is expected to vanish,\nas confirmed by the simulation data displayed in Fig. 10.\nNot all zeros of this sequence mark an inversion of the\nratchet current. For instance, for A2 /\u03a92 < 12 j1 the current is oriented in the natural direction of the effective\npotential, Eq. (36); for 21 j1 < A2 /\u03a92 < j1 , the coefficient of sin 2x changes sign and so does the ratchet natural orientation, or polarity; on further increasing A2 /\u03a92\nlarger than j1 , the sign of both Fourier coefficients in Eq.\n(36) become reversed: this is equivalent to turning V (x)\nupside-down (beside slightly re-modulating its profile),\nso that the polarity of V (x) stays negative. Following\nthis line of reasoning one predicts double zeros (i.e. no\ncurrent inversions) at \u03c80 = j1 , j2 , j3 , j4 , . . . .\nThis control technique can be easily applied to the\ntransport of massive Brownian particles both in symmetric (Borromeo and Marchesoni, 2007a) \u2013 see inset of Fig.\n10 \u2013 and asymmetric devices (Borromeo and Marchesoni,\n2006). Likewise, the use of a delay in a feedback control\nsignal (Craig et al., 2008a,b; Feito and Cao, 2007, 2008;\nSon et al., 2008) can, via synchronization mechanisms,\nefficiently improve the performance of Brownian motor\ncurrents; a scheme that as well can be implemented readily in experimental flashing ratchets (Craig et al., 2008a).\nIII. TRANSPORT IN NANOPORES\n\nMembranes in biology encase cells and their organelles\nand allow the compartmentalization of cellular processes,\nthereby operating far from thermal equilibrium, a condition that is essential to life. Membranes separate two\nphases by creating an active or passive barrier to the\ntransport of matter between them. As a first classification, membranes can be divided into biological and\nartificial membranes. The latter term is applied to all\nmembranes made by man with natural, possibly modified, materials and with synthetic materials (synthetic\nmembranes). Synthetic membranes can be further divided into organic (made with polymers) and inorganic\nmembranes (made with alumina, metals, etc.).\nTransport across a membrane occurs through channels,\nor pores (Berezhkovskii et al., 2003; Kolomeisky, 2007).\n\nIn several cases, the membrane transport properties must\nbe regarded as a collective effect, where the function of\nan individual channel is influenced by the presence of\n(possibly diverse) neighboring channels. This is the case,\nfor instance, of ion pumps (Im and Roux, 2002; L\u00e4uger,\n1991) in cellular membranes (Sec. III.A) or for coupled\nion channels which experience a common transmembrane\nvoltage. Single molecule techniques, however, allow for\nthe study and characterization of rectification properties\nof individual entities, such as single ion channels. Nowadays, synthetic membranes with assigned pore density\nand patterns are made commercially available. Moreover,\nby means of increasing sophisticated growth methods,\nirradiation (Fleischer et al., 1975), and nanofabrication\ntechniques (Dekker, 2007; Healy et al., 2007; Li et al.,\n2001; Storm et al., 2003), the cross section of membrane\npores can be modulated along their axis. As a result,\ntransport in artificial ion channels fabricated from asymmetric single pores of the most diverse geometries has become accessible to experiments (Healy et al., 2007; Siwy\nand Fuli\u0144ski, 2004), see also in Sec. III.B.\nIn this Section we focus on devices where the size of\nthe transported particles is comparable to the pore cross\nsection. Transport in these devices can be analyzed in\nterms of the one-particle 1D mechanisms illustrated in\nSec. II. Larger pores, commonly used to channel fluids\n(liquid or gaseous) or colloidal particles suspended in a\nfluid, are considered in Sec. VI in the context of microfluidic devices.\n\nA. Ion pumps\n\nAs remarked already before, biology teaches us useful lessons that can guide us in the design of artificial\nBrownian motors. Biological membranes knowingly form\nlipophilic barriers and have embedded a diverse range of\nunits which facilitate the selective movement of various\nionic and polar segments, or the pumping of protons and\nelectrons across channel like membrane openings. These\nbiological nanodevices make typically use of electrochemical gradients that enable them to pump a species against\nits concentration gradient at the expense of yet another\ngradient. Such devices thereby convert nondirectional\nchemical energy, from the resource of the hydrolysis of\nadenosintriphosphate (ATP), into directed transport of\ncharged species against electrochemical gradients.\nAlthough many details of the underlying mechanism\nare far from being understood, these machines apparently\nmake use of mechanisms that characterize the physics of\nBrownian motors (Astumian, 2007). A characteristic feature is that changes in the binding affinity at selective\nsites in the transmembrane region must be coupled to\nconformational changes which, in turn, control motion\ninto the desired direction. Thus, in contrast to rocked\nor pulsated ratchets, where the particle-potential interaction acts globally along the whole periodic substrate\nlandscape, the transport mechanism at work here can be\n\n\f19\nbetter described as an \"information\" ratchet (Astumian\nand Der\u00e9nyi, 1998; Parrondo and de Cisneros, 2002). Indeed, the effective potential bottlenecks to transduction\nof Brownian motion get modified locally according to the\nactual location of the transported unit; as a result, information gets transferred from the unit to the potential landscape. For example, this scheme can be used to\nmodel the pumping of Ca++ ions in Ca++ -ATPase (Xu\net al., 2002). Related schemes have been invoked also in\nthe theoretical and experimental demonstration of pumping of Na+ - and K+ -ions via pulsed electric field fluctuations in Na- and K-ATPase (Freund and SchimanskyGeier, 1999; Tsong, 2002; Xie et al., 1994), or for the\noperation of a catalytic wheel with help of a ratchetlike, electro-conformational coupling model (Rozenbaum\net al., 2004).\nYet another mechanism can be utilized to pump electrons in biomolecules. It involves nonadiabatic electron tunneling in combination with asymmetric, but nonbiased, nonequilibrium fluctuations, as proposed by Goychuk (2006). The nonequilibrium fluctuations originate\nfrom either random binding of negatively charged ATP or\nexternally applied asymmetric, but non-biased, electric\nstochastic fields. Likewise, unbiased nonequilibrum twostate fluctuations (telegraphic noise) can induce directional motion across an asymmetric biological nanopore,\nas numerically investigated for an aquaglyceroporin channel, where water and glycerol get transported by means\nof a rocked ratchet mechanism (Kosztin and Schulten,\n2004).\nFinally, we stress that in such realistic complex biological channels the physical implications of an externally\napplied control are often difficult to predict. This is\ndue to the multi-facetted consequences any control action\nmay have in terms of chemical variations, conformational\nchanges, polarization effects, and the alike. Moreover,\nat variance with single-molecule type experiments, single\nchannel recordings are not easily accessible when dealing\nwith biological molecules. Nanopores of lesser complexity\nare thus synthetic nanopores which can be fabricated by\nuse of bottom-down nanoscience techniques \u2013 the theme\nwe review next.\n\nB. Artificial nanopores\n\nWith the recent advances of track-etching (Fleischer\net al., 1975) and silicon technologies (Dekker, 2007; Li\net al., 2001; Storm et al., 2003), charge transport in a\nsingle nanopore became experimentally accessible. This\nis a substantial leap forward with respect to ion pump\nand zeolite transport experiments, where experimental\ndata are taken over a relatively high channel density.\nFabricated nanopores in polymer films and silicon materials are being investigated in view of their potential\napplications as biomimetic systems, that is, for modeling\nbiological channels, and as biosensors.\nSiwy and coworkers (Constantin and Siwy, 2007; Siwy\n\nFIG. 11 (Color online) Ion current recorded experimentally\nby Constantin and Siwy (2007) at 0.1M KCl, pH= 5.5\nthrough a single conical nanopore with diameters were 5 nm\nand 1000 nm, respectively. The pore rectification power is\n\u03b7 = 217 at 5V . Inset: geometry of a conical nanopore with\nschematic representation of surface charge distribution creating a bipolar nanofluidic diode. Figure provided by Zuzanna\nSiwy.\n\net al., 2005; Siwy and Fuli\u0144ski, 2002; Vlassiouk and Siwy,\n2007) have recently prepared a nanofluidic diode, which\nhad been predicted to rectify ion current in a similar\nway as a bipolar semiconductor diode rectifies electron\ncurrent (Daiguji et al., 2005). This diode is based on a\nsingle conically shaped nanopore track-etched in a polymer film with openings of several nm and 1 \u03bcm, respectively (see sketch in Fig. 11). The surface charge of the\npore is patterned so that two regions of the pore with\npositive and negative surface charges create a sharp barrier called the transition zone. This nanofluidic diode is\nbipolar in character since both positively and negatively\ncharged ions contribute to the measured current. Majumdar and coworkers (Karnik et al., 2007) fabricated a\nsimilar nanofluidic diode with a sharp barrier between a\npositively charged and a neutral side of the pore. The\npresence of only one type of surface charge causes the\nlatter device to be unipolar.\nIon rectification was achieved by applying a longitudinal ac voltage (Fig. 11); the system thus operate as a onecell 1D rocked ratchet (Sec. II.D.1), where the spatial\nasymmetry is determined by the interaction of a single\nion with the inhomogeneous charge distribution on the\npore walls. The rectification power of the pore is defined\nas the ratio of the ionic currents recorded for positive and\nnegative driving voltages, i.e., \u03b7(V ) = |I(V )|/|I(\u2212V )|.\nOf course, due to their asymmetric geometry, conical\npores can rectify diffusing ions also for uniform wallcharge distributions (Siwy et al., 2005); however, the\ncorresponding \u03b7 factor would be at least one order of\nmagnitude smaller than reported here.\nAs a serious limitation of the present design, it is not\npossible to control the rectification power of a given conical nanopore without introducing changes to its built-in\n\n\f20\nelectro-chemical potential. An alternate approach has\nbeen proposed by Kalman et al. (2007), where two superposed rectangular voltage signals of zero mean were\nused to control the net ion current through a nanopore of\npreassigned geometry. By changing the amplitude, frequency and relative phase of these signals these authors\nused the gating effect of Sec. II.C.2 to gain control over\nthe orientation and the magnitude of ion flow through\nthe pore. Their experimental data were found in excellent agreement with the theoretical prediction of Eq.\n(32). The magnitude of ion current variation achieved\nby asymmetric signal mixing was comparable with the\nincommensurate current off-set Eq. (30), which means\nthat the nanopore diode could be operated disregarding\nthe details of its intrinsic rectification power.\nWe conclude this Section on artificial nanopores anticipating that asymmetric micropores etched in silicon membranes also work as microfluidic ratchet pumps\nfor suspended colloidal particles (Kettner et al., 2000;\nMatthias and M\u00fcller, 2003). For instance, entropic\neffects on the rectification efficiency of the conical\nnanopores of Siwy and coworkers have been analyzed\nby Kosinska et al. (2008). However, in-pore diffusion\nin a liquid suspension requires a fully 3D analysis of the\npumping mechanism, which sets the basis for the fabrication of more complicated ionic devices (van der Heyden\net al., 2004; Stein et al., 2004). This category of devices\nis reviewed in Sec. VI.\n\nFIG. 12 (a) (Color online) Electric detection of individual\nDNA molecules with a nanopore. A constant voltage bias induces a steady-state ionic current through a single nanopore\n(left panel, from simulation); adding DNA to the negatively\nbiased compartment causes transient reductions of the ionic\ncurrent (right panel, from experiment). This reduced conductance is associated with the translocation of DNA through the\npore, which partially blocks the ionic current. After Aksimentiev et al. (2004). (b) Schematic diagram of the entropic trap\nin Han et al. (1999).\n\nC. Chain translocation\n\nThe opposite limit of composite objects passing\nthrough a much narrower opening is often called \"translocation\". Using the experimental set-up sketched in Fig.\n12(a), Kasianowicz et al. (1996) measured, for the first\ntime, the blockage currents of single-stranded RNA and\nDNA electrophoretically driven through the a transmembrane pore. Recent developments of this technique\ndemonstrated single nucleotide resolution for DNA hairpins (Ashkenasy et al., 2005; Gerland et al., 2004; Vercoutere et al., 2003), thus raising the prospect of creating nanopore sensors capable of reading the nucleotide\nsequence directly from a DNA or RNA strand, see for\nrecent comprehensive reviews (Healy, 2007; Movileanu,\n2008; Zwolak and Di Ventra, 2008). Nowadays, translocation mechanisms are investigated in both protein channels (mainly the bacterial \u03b1-hemolysin pore (Kasianowicz\net al., 1996)) and synthetic pores. Both these approaches\nhave advantages and disadvantages (Dekker, 2007; Healy,\n2007). Protein channels can be engineered with almost\nangstrom precision, but the lipid membrane in which\nthey may be incorporated is very mechanically unstable. Synthetic pores, on the other hand, offer robustness\nto the system, which allows to better characterize the\nphysical aspects of translocation phenomena.\nAs a main difference with ion transport, the translocation of a long polymer molecule in a 1D device involves\nentropic effects, which become important when the opening cross section grows comparable with the radius of gyration, R0 , of the polymer. These effects were predicted\nin (Arvanitidou and Hoagland, 1991) to account for the\nconformation changes a chain undergoes to move past a\nconduit constriction and, finally, observed by Han and\nCraighead (2000); Han et al. (1999) in an artificial channel. As a model pore-constriction system, these authors\nfabricated a channel consisting in a periodic sequence of\nregions of two different depths, as shown in Fig. 12(b).\nThe thick regions were 1mm deep, i.e., comparable with\nthe R0 of the double stranded DNA molecules they used\nin their experiment, whereas the depth of the thin region,\n90nm, was much smaller than R0 .\nThe thick regions act like \"entropic traps\", as the DNA\nmolecules are entropically prevented from entering the\nthin regions. For the same reason, a chain caught in between two traps, tends to fall back into the trap that\ncontains the most of it. In the presence of an external\nelectric field, escape from a trap is initiated by the introduction of a small portion of DNA into an adjacent thin\nregion, just enough to overcome the escaping activation\nbarrier. This initiation process is local in nature, and\nthe energy barrier does not depend on the total length of\nthe trapped DNA molecule. Once a DNA molecule is in\nthe transition state (once a proper length of \"beachhead\"\nis formed), it readily escapes the entropic trap, regardless of the length of the remaining molecule in the trap.\nQuite counter intuitively, Han and coworkers found that\nescape of DNA in longer entropic traps occurs faster than\n\n\f21\nin shorter ones.\nA theoretical interpretation of these results was given\nby Park and Sung (1999), who treated the dynamics of\na flexible polymer surmounting a 1D potential barrier as\na multidimensional Kramers activation process (H\u00e4nggi\net al., 1990). To determine the activation free energy,\nPark and Sung computed the free energy of the polymer\nat the transition state. For a small-curvature barrier,\nthe polymer keeps its random coil conformation during\nthe whole translocation process, giving rise to essentially\nthe same dynamics as that of a Brownian particle. For\na large-curvature barrier, on the other hand, a conformational transition (coilstretch transition) occurs at the\nonset of the barrier crossing, which significantly lowers\nthe activation free energy and so enhances the barrier\ncrossing rate. As the chain length varies, the rate shows\na minimum at a certain chain length due to the competition between the potential barrier and the free energy\ndecrease by chain stretching. Synthetic nanopores can\nthus be used as Coulter counter devices to selectively\ndetect single DNA molecules, resolving their length and\ndiameter.\nSpatial asymmetry can rectify translocation through\nsynthetic and biological pores, alike. This is the case,\nfor instance, of a hydrophobic polymer translocating\nacross a curved bilayer membrane. Extensive simulation (Baumg\u00e4rtner and Skolnick, 1995) showed that the\npolymer crosses spontaneously and almost irreversibly\nfrom the side of lower curvature to the side of higher\ncurvature, so as to maximize its conformational entropy\n(\"entropy\" ratchets, Sec. V.A.1). Moreover, at variance\nwith artificial channels, in protein translocation through\na biomembrane, the chemical structure of the pores can\ncome into play by helping rectify the thermal fluctuations of the stretched molecule: When specific predetermined segments of the protein cross the membrane,\nchemicals acting as chaperons bind on the segments to\nprevent their backward diffusion (Hartl, 1996; J\u00fclicher\net al., 1997; Nigg, 1997). The ensuing chemical asymmetry then competes with the entropic asymmetry to\ndetermine the translocation current.\n\nare not a part of the zeolite framework, and they stand\nin the channels. The combination of many properties \u2013\nsuch as the uniform cross section of their pores, the ion\nexchange properties, the ability to develop internal acidity, high thermal stability, high internal surface area \u2013\nmakes zeolites unique among inorganic oxides and also\nleads to unique activity and selectivity. As a result, zeolites can separate molecules based on size, shape, polarity, and degree of unsaturation among others (K\u00e4rger,\n2008b; K\u00e4rger and Ruthven, 1992).\nNuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) provides direct access to the density and the mobility of molecules in zeolites. By implementing a time-dependent NMR technique, termed pulsed field gradient NMR, K\u00e4rger and\ncoworkers (see for a review K\u00e4rger (2008a)) investigated\nthe problem of particle diffusion in a narrow zeolite\nnanopore. For instance, they observed that, owing to\nthe constrained pore geometry (0.73nm across), the mean\nsquare displacement of CF4 molecules (0.47nm in diameter) diffusing in zeolite AlPO4 -5, increases linearly with\nthe square root of the observation time rather than with\nthe observation time itself. That was an early experimental demonstration of the single-file diffusion mechanism\nintroduced in Sec. II.A.4. In the meantime, however,\nreal zeolite crystals have been repeatedly found to deviate\nnotably from their ideal textbook structure (Schemmert\net al., 1999), so that, their pore cross-sections ought to\nbe regarded as longitudinally corrugated. To what extent\nthis may affect particle diffusion is still matter of ongoing research (K\u00e4rger et al., 2005; Taloni and Marchesoni,\n2006).\n\n1. Zeolites\n\nMost zeolite structure types exhibit 3D pore networks.\nThe most studied example are a synthetic zeolites of type\nMFI. Their pore network is formed by mutually intersecting straight (in crystallographic y-direction) and sinusoidal (in crystallographic x-direction) channels. Although there is no corresponding third channel system, molecular propagation has been observed also in zdirection. Experimental data are consistent with a simple\nlaw of correlated diffusion anisotropy (Fenzke and K\u00e4rger,\n1993), a2z /Dz = a2x /Dx + a2y /Dy , where ai and Di , with\ni = x, y, z, denote respectively the lattice and the diffusion constants in the i-direction. This means that the\nmolecular \"memory\" is shorter than the mean traveling\ntime between two adjacent network intersections.\n\nZeolites are three dimensional, nanoporous, crystalline\nsolids (either natural or synthetic) with well-defined\nstructures that contain aluminum, silicon, and oxygen\nin their regular framework. The silicon and aluminum\natoms are tetrahedrally connected to each other through\nshared oxygen atoms; this defines a regular framework\nof voids and channels of discrete size, which is accessible\nthrough nanopores of well-defined molecular dimensions.\nThe negative electric charge of the zeolite framework is\ncompensated by (inorganic or even organic) cations or\nby protons (in the acidic form of the zeolites). The ions\n\nWith the advent of synthetic zeolites and zeolitic membranes, researchers are fascinated by the option that the\nexistence of different channel types within one and the\nsame material may be used for an enhancement of the\nperformance of catalytic chemical reactions. As the diffusion streams of the reactant and product molecules tend\nto interfere with each other, rerouting them through different channels may notably speed up a catalytic reactor;\nhence, the idea of reactivity enhancement by \"molecular\ntraffic control\" (Derouane and Gabelica, 1980; Neugebauer et al., 2000).\n\nD. Toward a next generation of mass rectifiers\n\n\f22\n2. Nanotubes\n\nAnother interesting category of artificial nanopore are\ncarbon nanotubes (Dresselhaus et al., 1996). Singlewalled carbon nanotubes are cylindrical molecules of\nabout 1 nm in diameter and 1-100 \u03bcm in length. They\nconsist of carbon atoms only, and can essentially be\nthought of as a layer of graphite rolled-up into a cylinder. Multiple layers of graphite rolled in on themselves\nare said to form a multi-wall carbon nanotube. The electronic properties of nanotubes depend strongly on the\ntube diameter as well as on the helicity of the hexagonal carbon lattice along the tube (chirality). For example, a slight change in the pitch of the helicity can\ntransform the tube from a metal into a large-gap semiconductor, hence they potential use as quantum wires in\nnanocircuits (Collins and Avouris, 2000; Dekker, 1999).\nAn even wider range of geometries and applications became available recently with the synthesis of various\noxide nanotubes (R\u011bmskar, 2004). With their hollow\ncores and large aspect ratios, nanotubes are excellent\nconduits for nanoscale amounts of material. Depending\non the filling material, experimenters have thus realized\nnanoscale magnets, hydrogen accumulators, thermometers and switches.\nNanotubes also provide an artificial substrate for controllable, reversible atomic scale mass transport. Regan\net al. (2004) attached indium nanocrystals to a multi-wall\ncarbon nanotube and placed it between electrodes set up\nin the sample chamber of an electron microscope. Applying a voltage to the tubes, they observed that the metallic\nparticles at one end of the tube gradually disappeared,\nwhile those at the other end grew. While the details\nof the underlying driving mechanisms (thermo- versus\nelectro-migration) remain unclear, they concluded that\nthe voltage dictates the directionality of that nanoscale\nmass conveyor. Experimenters even succeeded to synthesize carbon nanotubes encapsulating metallic atoms and\ncharacterize the electro-mechanical properties of such\nnanochannels (see e.g., Gao and Bando (2002)). In the\nnext future, carbon nanotubes will also be combined to\nform molecular \"gears\", whose feasibility has been proven\nso far only by simulation (Drexler, 1992). A conceptual\nexample is provided by a double-walled carbon nanotube\nconsisting of two coaxial single-walled nanotubes with\ndifferent chirality, immersed in an isothermal bath. In\nthe presence of a varying axial electrical voltage, this\nsystem would exhibit a unidirectional ratchet-like rotation as a function of the chirality difference between it\nconstituents (Marchesoni, 1996).\nNanotubes have also been used to realize prototypes\nof thermal diodes for phonon transport (Chang et al.,\n2006). With this concept in mind, one can further devise\na phonon Brownian motor aimed to ratchet a net heat\nflux from \"cold to hot\", as numerically demonstrated in a\nrecent work by Li et al. (2008). This class of devices has\nthe potential to allow an efficient control of heat fluxes\nat the nanoscales.\n\nIn spite of the recent advances in nanotechnology, (inner or outer) transport along nanotubes is still controlled\nby external gradients. Nevertheless, nanotube based\nratchets, though not immediately available, are like to\nbe one of the next frontiers in artificial Brownian motor\nresearch. Moreover, synthetic nanotubes are potential\nbuilding blocks also for nanofluidic devices (Holt et al.,\n2006), as discussed in Sec. VI.\nIV. COLD ATOMS IN OPTICAL LATTICES\n\nOptical lattices are periodic potential for atoms created by the interference of two or more laser fields (Grynberg and Robilliard, 2001; Jessen and Deutsch, 1996). In\nnear resonant optical lattices the laser fields produce simultaneously a periodic potential for the atoms and a\ncooling mechanism. The optical potential for an atom in\nan optical lattice is given by the light shift, or ac Stark\nshift, of the atomic energy level that acts as the ground\nstate of an assigned optical transition. The simplest case\nis represented by the Jg = 1/2 \u2192 Je = 3/2 atomic transition in a 1D configuration.\nLet us consider two counter-propagating laser fields,\ndetuned below the atomic resonance, with orthogonal\nlinear polarizations and same intensity and wavelength\n\u03bb. Their interference results into a spatial gradient with\npolarization ellipticity of period \u03bb/2. This in turn produces a periodic potential for the atom. For instance, the\natomic hyperfine ground states |g, \u00b1i = |Jg = 1/2, M =\n\u00b11/2i experience periodic potentials in phase opposition\nalong the direction x of light propagation, namely\nV0\n(\u22122 \u00b1 cos kx),\n(37)\n2\nwhere k = 2\u03c0/\u03bb and the depth of the potential wells\nV0 scales as IL /\u2206, with IL the total laser intensity and\n\u2206 the detuning from atomic resonance. As the laser\nfields are near to resonance with the atomic transition\nJg = 1/2 \u2192 Je = 3/2, the interaction with the light fields\nalso leads to stochastic transitions between the Zeeman\nsublevels |g, \u00b1i of the ground state. The rate of this transitions can be quantified by the photon-atom scattering\nrate \u03930 which scales as IL /\u22062 . It is therefore possible to\nvary independently the optical lattice depth V0 and \u03930 by\nchanging simultaneously IL and \u2206.\nThe stochastic transitions between ground states also\nlead to damping and fluctuations. The damping mechanism, named Sisyphus cooling, originates from the combined action of light shifts and optical pumping which\ntransfers, through cycles of absorption/spontaneous\nemission involving the excited state Je , atoms from one\nground state sublevel to the other one. Moreover, the\nstochastic transitions between the two potentials V\u00b1 (x)\nalso generate fluctuations of the instantaneous force experienced by the atom. In conclusion, the equilibrium\nbetween cooling and heating mechanisms determines a\nstationary diffusive dynamics of the atoms, a process confined to the symmetric ground-state optical lattice V\u00b1 (x).\nV\u00b1 (x) =\n\n\f23\nRandom amplitude pulsations of one symmetric potential, Eq. (37), do not suffice to produce rectification.\nThe only missing element to reproduce the rocked set-ups\nof Secs. II.C and II.D is the additive ac force F (t). In\norder to generate a time-dependent homogeneous force,\none of the lattice beams is phase modulated, and we will\nindicate by \u03c6(t) its time-dependent phase. In the laboratory reference frame the phase modulation of one of\nthe lattice beams results into the generation of a moving\noptical lattice V\u00b1 (x \u2212 \u03c6(t)/2k), reminiscent of the periodic sieves in (Borromeo and Marchesoni, 2007a). In the\naccelerated reference frame x \u2192 x \u2212 \u03c6(t)/2k, the optical\npotential would be stationary; however, an atom of mass\nm experiences also an inertial force in the z-direction proportional to the acceleration of the moving frame, namely\nF (t) = (m/2k)\u03c6\u0308(t). This is the homogeneous ac drive\nneeded to rock a cold atom ratchet.\nThe above described harmonic mixing/rocking ratchet\nset-up was recently used by Renzoni and coworkers\n(Gommers et al., 2005, 2007, 2006, 2008; Schiavoni et al.,\n2003) to investigate experimentally the relationship between symmetry and transport in 1D atom traps. We\ndiscuss here separately the experimental results for two\ndifferent cases: (1) a bi-harmonic driving including two\nharmonics at frequencies \u03a90 and 2\u03a90 , and (2) a multifrequency driving obtained by combining signals at three\ndifferent frequencies.\n\nA. Bi-harmonic driving\n\nThese authors (Gommers et al., 2005; Schiavoni et al.,\n2003) generated a bi-harmonic drive, Eq. (16), with\n\u03a92 = 2\u03a91 and \u03c61 = 0, and searched for a harmonic\nmixing current proportional to sin(\u03c62 \u2212 \u03c60 ). At variance\nwith Eq. 17, a phase lag \u03c60 was introduced to account\nfor the finite atom dissipation. Indeed, by generalizing\nour argument of Sec. II.C.1, one can easily prove that\nincreasing the damping makes \u03c60 drop from 0 down to\n\u2212\u03c0/2. In the experiment, the atom dissipation could be\ntuned continuously, without changing the optical potential constant V0 , by varying simultaneously IL and \u2206 at\na constant IL /\u2206 ratio; thus, harmonic mixing was experimentally accessible in both limiting regimes of zero and\ninfinite damping.\nThe experimental results of Fig. 13 for cesium atoms\ncooled in the \u03bcK range, clearly demonstrate the mechanism of harmonic mixing at work. In fact, the net atom\nvelocity plotted in panel (a) is well fitted by v/vr =\nA\u2206 sin(\u03c62 \u2212 \u03c60 ), where the dependence of \u03c60 on \u03930 is\nas in panel (b), and A\u2206 is a characteristic function of the\nsystem (Gommers et al., 2005). For the smallest scattering rate examined in the experiment, no current was\ngenerated at \u03c62 = l\u03c0, with l integer, as expected from\nEq. (17). On the other hand, the magnitude of the phase\nshift \u03c60 increases with increasing the scattering rate, thus\ncausing current generation also for \u03c62 = l\u03c0. Besides confirming the notion of harmonic mixing, the experimental\n\nresults in Gommers et al. (2005); Schiavoni et al. (2003)\nalso suggest that symmetry breaking can be controlled by\ndissipation. Closely related results have been reported by\nUstinov et al. (2004) in their attempt to control fluxon\nratcheting in Josephson junctions by means of harmonic\nmixing.\n\nB. Multi-frequency driving\n\nRecent experiments with multi-frequency driving\n(Gommers et al., 2007, 2006) aimed to investigate the\ntransition from periodic to quasi-periodic driving, and to\nexamine how the analysis of Sec. II.C is modified in this\ntransition. The multi-frequency driving was obtained by\nadding a sinusoidal component to the ac drive employed\nin the previous Section, i.e.,\nF (t) = A1 cos(\u03a91 t) + A2 cos(2\u03a91 + \u03c62 ) + A3 cos(\u03a93 t + \u03c63 )\n(38)\nFor \u03a93 /\u03a91 irrational the driving is quasi-periodic.\nClearly, in a real experiment \u03a93 /\u03a91 is always a rational number, which can be written as p/q, with p, q two\ncoprime positive integers. However, as the duration of\nthe experiment is finite, by choosing p and q sufficiently\nlarge it is possible to obtain a driving which is effectively\nquasi-periodic on the time scale of the experiment.\nLet us consider first the case of periodic driving, with\n\u03a93 /\u03a91 rational. Adding a third harmonic with phase\nconstant \u03c63 6= 0 in Eq. (38) breaks the time symmetry of\nF (t) so that directed transport is allowed also for \u03c60 =\n0 and \u03c62 = l\u03c0. In other words, for \u03c63 6= 0 the third\ndriving component leads to an additional phase shift of\nthe current as a function of \u03c62 . As a results, the current\nwill retain its sinusoidal phase dependence sin(\u03c62 \u2212 \u03c60 ),\nas above, with the difference that now \u03c60 accounts for\nthe phase shifts produced both by dissipation and by\nthe added driving component. Following the discussion\nsketched in Sec. II.D.4, one easily concludes that in the\nquasi-periodic regime the third harmonic at frequency\n\u03a93 is not relevant to characterize the time symmetry of\nthe forcing signal, which is entirely determined by the\nbi-harmonic terms at frequency \u03a91 and 2\u03a92 .\nIn later experiments (Gommers et al., 2007, 2006), the\ntransition to quasi-periodicity was investigated by studying the atomic current as a function of \u03c62 for different p/q. By increasing p and q the driving was made\nmore and more quasi-periodic on the finite duration of\nthe experiment, with the quantity pq an easily accessible\nmeasure of the degree of quasi-periodicity. The data for\nthe average atomic current were fitted with the function\nv/vmax = sin(\u03c62 \u2212 \u03c60 ) and the resulting value for \u03c60 were\nplotted as a function of pq. For small values of pq, i.e.,\nfor periodic driving, the added component at frequency\n\u03a93 lead to a shift which strongly depends on the actual\nvalue of pq. For larger values of pq, i.e., approaching\nquasi-periodicity, the phase shift \u03c60 tends to a constant\nvalue independent of \u03c63 , which coincides with the purely\n\n\f24\n\nFIG. 13 Cold atoms in an optical lattice. (a) Average atomic velocity as a function of the phase \u03c62 for different values of\n\u0393s = [\u03c9v /(2\u03c0)]2 /\u2206 (a quantity proportional to the scattering rate \u03930 ). The data are labeled by the lattice detuning \u2206, as the\nvibrational frequency at the bottom of the wells was kept constant, \u03c9v /2\u03c0 = 170kHz; the forcing frequency is \u03a91 /2\u03c0 = 100kHz.\nThe lines are the best fit of the data with the function v/vr = A\u2206 sin(\u03c6 \u2212 \u03c60 ), where vr = h\u0304k/m is the so-called atom recoil\nvelocity. (b) Experimental results for the phase shift \u03c60 as a function of \u0393s . After Gommers et al. (2005).\n\ndissipative phase-shift measured in the bi-harmonic driving case of Sec. IV.A. The experimental results confirm\nthat in the quasi-periodic limit, the only relevant symmetries are those determined by the periodic bi-harmonic\ndriving and by dissipation.\n\nC. More cold atom devices\n\nCold atoms in optical traps proved to be a playground\nfor rectification experiments.\n(i) Gating effect. For instance Gommers et al. (2008)\nmodified the experimental set-up described above, to\ndemonstrate experimentally a gating ratchet with cold\nrubidium atoms in a driven near-resonant optical lattice.\nAs suggested in Sec. II.C.2, a single-harmonic periodic\nmodulation of the optical potential depth with frequency\n\u03a92 was applied, together with a single-harmonic rocking\nforce with frequency \u03a91 . The modulation of the optical\npotential depth V0 was obtained by modulating the intensity IL of the laser beams. This also resulted in an unavoidable modulation of the optical pumping rate, which\naffected only the fitting phase shift \u03c60 . Directed motion\nwas observed for rational values of \u03a92 /\u03a91 , a result due\nto the breaking of the symmetries of the system.\n(ii) Pulsated ratchets. Although a bona fide rocked\nratchet for cold atoms in an optical lattice has not been\nrealized (see e.g. Ritt et al. (2006)), yet, a clever variation of 1D optical lattice described above allowed an early\ndemonstration of randomly pulsated ratchet (MenneratRobilliard et al., 1999). These authors set the polarizations of the laser beams at an angle \u03b8 6= \u03c0/2 and applied a\nweak Zeeman magnetic field orthogonal to the optical lattice. The effect of the magnetic field consisted in removing the degeneracy of the ground states by adding a \u03bb/2\nwavelength components to both potentials in Eq. (37),\nwhich thus acquired different asymmetric profiles. As a\n\nconsequence, the random optical transitions between the\nmodified potentials V\u00b1 (x) turned out to propel trapped\ncold rubidium atoms in the vertical direction, with the\nsign that depended on \u03b8 and on the orientation of the\nmagnetic field.\nIn Sec. II.D.2 we reported that rectification can occur\non symmetric 1D substrates that shift instantaneously\nback and forth in space with a fixed amplitude, namely,\non substrate that are subjected to a time-discrete phase\nmodulation (periodic or random, alike). In this case,\nbreaking the supersymmetry condition (14) requires appropriate asymmetric space-dependent switching rates\n(Gorman et al., 1996). Based on this rectification scheme,\nSj\u00f6lund et al. (2006) realized an simple flashing ratchet\nfor cold atoms. It consisted again of a \u03bcK cold gas of\ncesium atoms switching between two symmetric ground\nstate optical lattices, coupled via optical pumping. In\nthe presence of induced friction, although small, and for\nappropriate laser detunings and intensities of the laser\nbeams, the degeneracy of the ground states was removed\nby making one ground state, say V+ , long lived and the\nother one, V\u2212 , short lived. If we further consider that\nthe two optical lattices were shifted one relative to the\nother, V\u2212 (x) = V+ (x \u2212 x0 ), then we conclude that the\nswitching rates between potentials were state and position dependent with k\u2212\u2192+ (x) \u001d k+\u2192\u2212 (x). In this setup,\nthe atoms execute stationary time-asymmetric sequences\nof random jumps between V+ and V\u2212 . During the time\nspent in the short-lived lattice V\u2212 , they experience a potential with an incline that depends on x0 . Thus, their\ndiffusion is strongly enhanced in one specific direction,\nand correspondingly reduced in the opposite direction.\nIn the experiment, the spatial shift x0 and the transition\nrates between the two optical lattices could be adjusted\nat will. A directed motion with constant velocity was observed in the absence of additional forcing terms, i.e., for\nF (t) = 0, except for specific system parameters, where\n\n\f25\nsymmetry was restored. Moreover, these authors showed\nthat their device, when operated in 3D (Ellmann et al.,\n2003), can generate directed motion in any direction.\n\nV. COLLECTIVE TRANSPORT\n\nThe studies on rectification mechanisms reviewed in\nSec. II, have been conducted mostly for a single particle;\nhowever, often systems contain many identical particles,\nand the collective interactions between them may significantly influence the transport of particle aggregates\n(Aghababaie et al., 1999). For example, interactions\namong coupled Brownian motors can give rise to novel cooperative phenomena like anomalous hysteresis and zerobias absolute negative resistance (Reimann et al., 1999).\nThe role of interactions among individual motors plays a\nparticular important role for the occurrence of unidirectional transport in biological systems, e.g. see Sec. 9 in\nthe review by Reimann (2002).\nIn this section we shall restrict ourselves to the properties of 1D and 2D systems of point-like interacting particles, although an extension to 3D systems is straightforward. Let the pair interaction potential W(r) be a\nfunction of the pair relative coordinates r = (x, y), characterized by an appropriate parameter g, quantifying\nthe strength of the repelling (g > 0) or attracting force\n(g < 0), and by a constant \u03bb, defining the pair interaction length. An appropriate choice of W(r), with g > 0,\ncan be used to model hardcore particles with diameter \u03bb\n(Savel'ev et al., 2003, 2004b). We term the pair interaction long-range, if \u03bb is larger than the average interparticle distance, and short-range in the opposite regime. In\nthe absence of perturbations due to the substrate or the\nexternal drives, long-range repelling particles rearrange\nthemselves to form a triangular Abrikosov (1957) lattice.\nWhen placed on a disordered substrate or forced through\na constrained geometry, such an ideal lattice breaks up\ninto lattice fragments punctuated by point-like defects\nand dislocations and separated by faulty boundaries. In\nthe presence of a drive, such boundaries act like 1D easyflow paths, or rivers, for the movable particles. This\nprocess, often referred to as \"plastic\" flow, is analyzed\nnumerically in Reichhardt et al. (1998).\nRectification of interacting particles occurs as a combined effect of the configuration of the device and the\ngeometry of its microscopic constituents. In this context the dimensionality of the underlying dynamics is also\nimportant: (1) Transport in some 2D geometries can often be reduced to the 1D mechanisms illustrated in Sec.\nII (reducible 2D geometries); (2) Under certain circumstances, however, a bona-fide 2D rectification may occur\nat a non-zero angle with the driving force (irreducible\n2D geometries). Finally, we remark that particle interaction can be exploited to rectify particles of one species\nby acting on particles of another species, alone, either\nby an appropriate drive or a specially tailored substrate\ngeometry.\n\nFIG. 14 1D reducible asymmetric geometries: (a) Channel with asymmetric profile y(x) = y0 \u2212 y1 [sin(2\u03c0x/L) +\n1\nsin(4\u03c0x/L)]; the parameters y1 and y0 control the width\n4\n2d and the bottleneck 2a; (b) Disordered pattern of circular\ndefects generated with periodic distribution y(x) along the\nx-axis\n.\n\nA. Asymmetric 1D geometries\n\nWe consider now two examples of 2D reducible geometries where the transport of massless repelling particles,\nsubjected to an external ac drive, occurs as a collective\neffect, namely, under conditions incompatible with the\nrectification of a single particle. In particular, we show\nthat collective effects make transport of interacting particles even in the absence of an ad hoc ratchet substrate.\n\n1. Boundary effects\n\nLet us consider the asymmetric channel sketched in\nFig. 14(a) filled with n repelling particles per unit cell.\nThe corresponding particle density is \u03c1 = n/al , where al\nis the area of the channel unit cell. The walls are rigid and\nthe particle-wall collisions are taken elastic and relatively\nshort-range (interaction length not much larger than \u03bb).\nThe profiles \u00b1y(x) of the upper (+) and lower (\u2212) walls\nare modeled by an appropriate double-sine function; 2d\nand 2a denote, respectively, the width of the channel and\nof its bottlenecks. Due to the repulsive interactions, the\nparticles are pressed against the walls which corresponds\nto an effective asymmetric spatial modulation. As a consequence, when driven by an ac force, the particles are\nmore likely to flow to the left than to the right. The ensuing rectification mechanism is reminiscent of a 1D rocked\nratchet with an inverted potential of Eq. (23). Numerical\nsimulations, besides supporting this prediction, clearly\nindicate an optimal or resonant, temperature regime in\nwhich the particle drift is maximized. This observation\ncan be explained by noticing that at low temperatures,\nthe ac drive causes a moving particle to migrate to the\n\n\f26\ncenter of the channel where it no longer interacts with\nthe boundaries; while at high temperatures the driving\nforce becomes irrelevant and thus the particle is no longer\npushed through the channel bottlenecks periodically in\ntime. The first simulation evidence of this phenomenon\nwas produced by Wambaugh et al. (1999). Their results\nobtained for the special case of magnetic vortex channeling are discussed in Sec. VII.A.\nAt high enough particle densities, \u03c1, the net current in\nthe channel is expected to be suppressed, as the repelling\nparticles end up clogging the bottlenecks and thus hampering collective longitudinal oscillations. In the opposite\nlimit of, say, n = 1, the arguments above seem to rule out\nrectification, as a single oscillating particle would be confined in the inner channel of radius a. However, this conclusion holds only in the absence of thermal fluctuations,\nT = 0. At finite T , reducing the diffusion in a 2D channel to a 1D process implies defining an effective diffusion\nconstant (II.A.3), D(x)/D0 = [1+y 0 (x)2 ]\u22121/3 , equivalent\nto a periodic asymmetric modulation of the temperature\n(Reguera et al., 2006) (a Seebeck ratchet in the notation\nof Reimann (2002)). A particle crossing a channel bottleneck perceives a lower effective temperature on the left,\nwhere the wall is steeper, than on the right, so that it\ngets sucked forwards; the opposite happens in correspondence\nto the largest channel cross-sections. As long as\nR\ndx/D(x) 6= 0, the oscillating motion of a single particle can indeed be rectified, with the sign that depends\non the details of the wall profile (Ai and Liu, 2006). No\nmatter how weak, such a mechanism, termed \"entropic\"\nratchet (Slater et al., 1997), supports the conclusion of\nWambaugh et al. (1999) that rectification in a channel\noccurs only at finite T , as a certain amount of noise is\nneeded for the particle to explore the asymmetric geometric of the device. Moreover, the argument above hints at\nthe occurrence of an optimal channel density \u03c1, as detected in real superconducting devices (Sec. VII.A).\n\n2. Asymmetric patterns of symmetric traps\n\nOlson et al. (2001) proposed a new type of 2D ratchet\nsystem which utilizes gradients of pointlike disorder,\nrather than a uniformly varying substrate potential. Let\nus consider a 2D sample containing a periodically graduated density of point defects, as sketched in Fig. 14(b).\nEach defect is depicted as a circular micro-hole, which\nacts as a symmetric short-range particle trap of finite\ndepth. In real experiments, such defects can actually\nbe created by either controlled irradiation techniques\nor direct-write electron-beam lithography (Kwok et al.,\n2002). The defect density \u03c1l (x) was chosen to be uniform\nalong the vertical axis, and to follow a typical doublesine asymmetric profile of Eq. (23) along the horizontal\naxis. Let us now inject into the sample repelling massless\nparticles with average density \u03c1 and interaction length \u03bb.\nThe defect radius controls particle pinning by defects and\nwas taken much smaller than \u03bb. For a sufficiently high\n\nparticle-to-defect density ratios, the particles fill most of\nthe pinning sites and create an effective repulsive potential. If we further assume long-range particle pair interactions W(r), such a 2D potential surely gets insensitive to\nthe details of the defect distribution; it only retains the\nperiodic horizontal modulation of \u03c1l (x), thus resulting\nin a mean-field ratchet potential V (x), like in Eq. (23).\nThe effective amplitude V0 is a function of at least three\nlength scales: the interaction constant, the average particle distance and the average defect spacing. A certain\nfraction of the particles does not become pinned at individual defects but, subjected to an applied ac drive, can\nmove in the interstitial regions between pinning sites. Although the moving interstitials do not directly interact\nwith the short-ranged defects, they feel the long-range\ninteraction of the particles trapped at the pinning sites\nand described by the mean-field potential V (x). As a\nconsequence, a horizontally applied ac drive can induce\na longitudinal particle transport, as proven in Olson et al.\n(2001) by means of numerical simulation.\nTwo conditions are instrumental to the onset of a rectification current: (1) a finite temperature, T > 0, and\n(2) a defect filling fraction close to or larger than one,\nboth conditions being required for interstitial particles\nto get and stay unpinned. As in Sec. V.A.1, condition\n(1) implies the existence of an optimal rectification temperature. The dependence on the forcing frequency and\namplitude are as discussed in Sec. II.D.1. These ideas\nhave been implemented to control transport of colloids\nand charge carriers in experimental setups where point\ndefect gradients could be engineered at will (cf. Secs.\nVI.A, VII.B and VIII.C).\n\nB. 2D lattices of asymmetric traps\n\nExamples of substrates sustaining transverse rectification are asymmetric potential barriers, height q > 0,\nor wells, depth q < 0, either isolated or arranged into\n1D chains and 2D lattices. Similar lateral displacement\ndevices, also known as bumper arrays, have been proposed to separate particles by exploiting their mass and\nsize dispersion (Heller and Bruus, 2008; Savel'ev et al.,\n2005). Consider for instance the pyramidal potential barriers/wells with isosceles triangular cross-section. This\ngeometry, sketched in Fig. 15, is a generalization of the\nexperimental setup by Villegas et al. (2003).\nThe substrates discussed here combine two types of\nasymmetry: the triangular shape of their building blocks\nand the asymmetry associated with the pyramidal structure of each block. The latter asymmetry affects the\nmotion of the particles only if the drive is strong enough\nto push them across the barriers/wells. Savel'ev et al.\n(2005) have numerically simulated the dynamics of a\ngas of repelling massive particles driven across 1D or 2D\nlattices of barriers/wells for different parameters of the\nsubstrate lattice (Fig. 15, bottom panel), of the drive\nF(t) and of the particle pair potential W(r). Although\n\n\f27\n\nFIG. 15 (Color online) Top panel: asymmetric 2D arrays of\npotential energy barrier/wells, top view.

Particle distributions for strong long-range (b,c) and weak short-range (d,e)\ninteractions for the A1 values indicated by arrows in (a). See\nfor details Savel'ev et al. (2005).\n\nSavel'ev et al. (2005) have shown that inertial effects often enhance transverse rectification, we restrict our presentation to the case of massless particles, certainly the\nmost relevant for technological applications. We consider\nnext two distinct operating regimes:\n(i) Deterministic setups. An ac force applied along the\ny-axis, i.e., parallel to the symmetry axis of the pyramid\ncross-section, was known to induce a longitudinal particle\n\ndrift in the drive direction (see for more details in Zhu\net al. (2004) and Sec. VII). Indeed, driving a (distorted)\nlattice of repelling particles along the crystallographic\naxis of the substrate, oriented parallel to the symmetry\naxis of the substrate blocks, makes the system reducible\nto a mean-field 1D dynamics in that direction, along the\nline of Sec. V.A. Due to the pyramidal shape of its building block, the reduced 1D substrate is spatially asymmetric, which explains the reported longitudinal particle\nflows.\n(ii) Diffusive setups. Under appropriate conditions,\ninstead, dc or ac forces applied perpendicularly to the\nsymmetry axis may induce a transverse particle drift in\nthe y-direction. For all geometries considered, the net\nvelocity of a gas of non-interacting overdamped particles\ndriven perpendicularly to the symmetry axis vanishes for\nT \u2192 0. Indeed, sooner or later each particle gets captured in a horizontal lane between two triangle rows and\nthen keeps oscillating back and forth in it forever. At finite temperature, instead, fluctuations tend to push the\nparticle out of its lane, thus inducing the net transverse\ncurrents reported in the earlier literature (Bier et al.,\n2000; Duke and Austin, 1998; Huang et al., 2004). More\nremarkably, Savel'ev et al. (2005) reported that the interaction among particles not only contributes to transverse rectification but actually plays a dominant role if\nthe interaction length \u03bb, or the particle density are large\nenough. In particular, particle-particle interaction was\nshown to control transverse rectification for both weak\nshort-range and strong long-range inter-particle forces\n(see frame (a) of Fig. 15). Therefore, transverse rectification of interacting colloidal particles (short range)\nand magnetic vortices (long range) are expected to differ\nappreciably (see Secs. VI.A, and VII).\nTo illustrate the key mechanism of transverse rectification, we consider only rectification by pyramidal barriers, q > 0, subjected to the square ac force F (t) =\nA1 sgn[cos(\u03a91 t)]. For a fully detailed analysis the reader\nis referred to Savel'ev et al. (2005). Let us consider\nfirst the geometry in frames (b)-(e) of Fig. 15 (bottom\npanel), where the pyramids are stacked up in a close row\n(\u2206y = 0). The particle interactions have a strong impact\non the equilibrium particle distribution; a transition from\nan ordered lattice-like to a disordered liquid-like phase is\ndisplayed in frames (b)-(e). Nevertheless, the transverse\ncurrents hvy i show a qualitatively similar A1 dependence\nfor both weak short-range and strong long-range interactions; only the decaying tail is longer for the latter ones.\nThe region of the linear growth of hvy i for the case of\nweak short-range interaction corresponds to the regime\nwhen a constant fraction of particles (less than 1/2 because of the geometry of the system) is rectified into the\ny-direction. This regime applies for increasing A1 until\nwhen particles start crossing over the triangles [frames\n(d) and (e)]. These results can be easily generalized to\ndescribe transverse rectification in any 2D lattice of triangular shaped barriers/wells.\nSavel'ev et al. (2005) also simulated the case of a 2D\n\n\f28\narray of pyramids, top panel of Fig. 15, where a gap\nbetween triangles along the y-axis, \u2206y > 0, turned out\nto make the net current sensitive to the particle-particle\ninteraction length \u03bb. In the limit of low T , if \u03bb is smaller\nthan a certain threshold value \u03bbc \u223c \u2206y , then the net\ncurrent vanishes; if \u03bb exceeds \u03bbc then the current rapidly\nincreases. This effect has been advocated to separate\nparticles according to their interaction length. More precisely, particles having an interaction length smaller than\n\u03bbc would pass through the array, or sieve of barriers separated by \u2206y . In contrast, particles with a longer interaction length \u03bb > \u03bbc would be sifted sidewise. On\nconnecting several such sieves with different gap \u2206y , one\ncan construct a device capable of separating the different\nfractions of a particle mixture.\nThe overall conclusions of Savel'ev et al. (2005) do\nnot change on replacing barriers with wells of the same\nshape, nor do so for lattices of asymmetric pins of different aspect-ratio and geometries (Bier et al., 2000; Chepelianskii and Shepelyansky, 2005; Duke and Austin, 1998;\nErtas, 1998; Huang et al., 2004; Zhu et al., 2003a, 2004).\nThis effect had been anticipated to some extent by Lorke\net al. (1998), who investigated the magneto-transport\nproperties of a square lattice of triangular antidots of\nthe type shown in Fig. 15. Antidot lattices are 2D electron gases with appropriately placed sub-micron voids.\nThese authors fabricated their lattices by electron beam\nlithography on shallow high electron mobility transistor structures, grown on semi-insulating gallium-arsenide\nsubstrates. In particular, they reported evidence that under far-infrared irradiation, electron sloshing in-between\nthe antidot rows lead to a net electric current along the\nsymmetry axis of the antidots. Significant transverse\neffects were observed in the presence of an orthogonal\nmagnetic field. Moreover, in most applications to the\nelectrophoresis of macromolecules, the particles moving\nthrough these sieve are suspended in the fluid where they\ndiffuse, thus involving additional microfluidic effects (Sec.\nVI).\n\nC. Binary mixtures\n\nWe address now the problem as how to induce and\ncontrol the net transport of passive particles (target or A\nparticles), namely, particles that are little sensitive to the\napplied drives and/or substrates. Savel'ev et al. (2003,\n2004b) proposed to employ auxiliary B particles that (1)\ninteract with the target species and (2) are easy to drive\nby means of external forces. By driving the auxiliary\nparticles one can regulate the motion of otherwise passive\nparticles through experimentally accessible means.\nSavel'ev and coworkers considered a mixture of two\nspecies of pointlike overdamped Brownian particles A\nand B at temperature T , diffusing on the 1D periodic\nsubstrates described by the potentials VA (x) and VB (x),\nrespectively. Particles of type A interact pair-wise with\none another as well as with the B particles via the po-\n\ntentials WAA and WAB (= WBA ), while WBB describes\nthe interaction of the B pairs. The pair interaction is\nquantified by the tunable strengths gij , with i, j = A, B,\nwhereas the interaction constants \u03bbij play no significant\nrole as long as they are conveniently small.\nTo illustrate the rectification mechanisms in a binary\nmixture, we review in some detail the case of a pulsated\ndevice with oscillating temperature, i.e. a temperature\nratchet studied originally by Reimann et al. (1996), see\nalso Sec. II.D.2). The model can be made even simpler\nby assuming that (i) One subsystem (say, the auxiliary B\nparticles) is subject to an asymmetric ratchet potential\nVB (x), while the other one (the target A particles) is\nnot, VA (x) = 0. This may happen, for instance, in a\nmixture of neutral and charged particles with the ratchet\npotential being produced by an electrical field; (ii) The\ninteraction among particles of the same type is repulsive,\ni.e., gAA > 0, gBB > 0.\nUnder these operating conditions, the B particles condense naturally at the minima of the asymmetric substrate potential [see Figs. 16(a) and (b), bottom panels]. In addition, if the B particles repel the A particles,\ngAB > 0, then the latter ones will accumulate in the regions where the density of the B particles is minimum,\nthat is near the maxima of the substrate potential VB (x).\nVice versa, for attractive AB interactions, gAB < 0, the\nB particles concentrate around the minima of VB (x).\nTherefore, the target A particles feel an effective potential VAeff (x), which has opposite spatial asymmetry with\nrespect to VBeff (x) for gAB > 0, and has the same asymmetry for gAB < 0 [see Figs. 16(a) and (b), top panels].\nNote that for low occupation numbers nA and nB , the\nbare potential VB (x) is only marginally affected by particle interaction, i.e., VBeff (x) ' VB (x). During the lower T\nhalf cycle, all particles are confined tighter around the\nminima of the relevant effective potential, while, during the higher T half cycle, the particles of both species\ndiffuse more easily out of the VAeff (x), VBeff (x) potential\nwells. As the asymmetry of the ratchet potentials VAeff (x)\nand VBeff (x) for repelling A and B particles is opposite, so\nis the orientation of their currents. On the contrary, two\nattracting A and B species drift in the same direction.\nThis implies that the transport of both particle species\ncan be effectively and separately controlled by regulating\ntheir number nA and nB per unit cell, without the need\nof tuning their substrate.\nAs gAA , gBB > 0, the potential wells of VAeff (x)\n(VBeff (x)) tend to flatten out when increasing the corresponding density nB (nA ). This results in the decay\nof the associated ratchet current hvB i (hvB i). In contrast, the ratchet asymmetry and current of one species\nmay be enhanced by increasing the density of the other\nmixture component. For instance, in the case of AB attractive forces, the A particles tend to concentrate in the\nregions of higher B densities, that is around the minima\nof VB , thus attracting even more B particles and making\nthe VBeff (x) potential wells deeper. In short, one can enhance the transport of the target particles by adding a\n\n\f29\n\nFIG. 16 (Color online) Spatial dependence of the effective\npotentials VAeff (x), VBeff (x) at different densities of the A and B\nparticles. In both panels, particles of the same type repel one\nanother; the interaction between particles of different species\nis repulsive in (a) and attractive in (b). There is no substrate\nfor the A particles, VA (x) = 0, whereas the ratchet potential\nVB (x) is piecewise linear: VB (0 < x < l+ ) = x/l+ , VB (l+ <\nx < l) = (1 \u2212 x)/l\u2212 , with l\u2212 = 0.2 and l+ = 0.8. The other\ncoupling parameters are gAA = gBB = |gAB | = 1 and T = 1.\n[After Savel'ev et al. (2005)].\n\ncertain amount of auxiliary particles. All these properties have been reproduced analytically in the framework\nof the nonlinear Fokker-Planck formalism (Savel'ev et al.,\n2003, 2004c).\nThe influence of the interspecies interaction on the\ntransport of a binary mixture has been investigated further by Savel'ev et al. (2004b), where dc and ac external\nforces were applied at constant temperature, to the particles either of one species, only, or of both, simultaneously. Their main results can be summarized as follows:\n(1) with increasing the intensity of an applied dc driving force, there is a dynamical phase transition from a\n\"clustered\" motion of A and B particles to a regime of\nweakly coupled motion (Marchesoni et al., 2006b); (2)\nby applying a time-asymmetric zero-mean drive to the B\nspecies only, one can obtain a net current for both the\nA and B species, even in the absence of a substrate; (3)\nwhen two symmetric ac signals act independently on the\nA and B particles, and only the particles of one species\nfeel an asymmetric substrate, then, the two species can\nbe delivered in the same or opposite direction by tuning\nthe relative signal phase (for both attractive and repulsive AB interactions). Superconducting devices based on\nthese two-species transport mechanisms have been realized experimentally in recent years (Sec. VII.C).\n\nVI. MICROFLUIDICS\n\nMicrofluidics (Squires and Quake, 2005) is playing\nan ever growing role in controlling transport of particles, or even whole extended phases, on the micro- and\nnanoscales. The ability to manipulate the dynamics of\nliquids is crucial in various applications such as for a\n\nlab-on-a-chip technology. The Brownian motor concept\nhas recently been invoked in different contexts to face\nthis challenge. In this regard we remark that the inertial forces of small suspended particles are typically quite\nsmall (Purcell, 1977). Pointlike particles can then be considered to be advectively transported by the fluid velocity\nfield at the particle's actual position. Then, for an incompressible liquid the particle dynamics is volume conserving and consequently no dynamical attractors emerge\n(Kostur et al., 2006). However, for extended particles the\nlocal velocity of a surface point need not coincide with\nthe fluid velocity which would act at this point in the\nabsence of the particle. Notably, for extended objects\nwith internal degrees of freedom the volume of the state\nspace is no longer conserved by the dynamics, thus giving rise to attractors for stationary flow fields (Kostur\net al., 2006). Of course, Brownian diffusion provides an\nadditional transport mechanism that must also be taken\ninto account.\nWe remark here that in spite of the intrinsic hydrodynamical effects, microfluidic devices do not fall into\nthe category of collective ratchets as defined in Sec. V,\nbecause here transported objects are not required to interact with one another. The suspension fluid still plays\na central role: (a) it powers particle transport, and (b) it\ndetermines how the particle dynamics is coupled to the\nasymmetric geometry of the substrate. Genuine collective ratchets are discussed in Sec. VII.\n\nA. Transporting colloids\n\nMany physical examples and technological applications\ninvolve particles or molecules in solution that undergo a\ndirected net motion in response to the action of a ratchet.\nThere, the ratchet does not induce a mean flow of the\nsolvent itself. For instance, colloidal particles or macromolecules, suspended in solution, move when exposed to\na sawtooth electric potential that is successively turned\non and off (Rousselet et al., 1994). Electrolytic effects can\nbe avoided by shuttling microsized Brownian polystyrene\nparticles by optically trapping them with repeatedly applied on-off cycles in an optical tweezer, thus mimicking a flashing Brownian motor (Faucheux et al., 1995;\nFaucheux and Libchaber, 1995; Marquet et al., 2002).\nAs a function of the cycle frequency one can even detect\nflux reversal of diffusing colloidal spheres in an optical\nthree-state thermal Brownian motor (Lee et al., 2004).\nThis modus operandi of a Brownian motor can therefore be put to work to pump or separate charged species\nsuch as fragments of DNA. A micromachined silicon-chip\ndevice that transports rhodamine-labeled fragments of\nDNA in water has been demonstrated with a flashing onoff Brownian motor scheme by Bader et al. (1999). Yet\nother devices are based on ideas and experimental realizations of entropic ratchets (Chou et al., 1999; Duke and\nAustin, 1998; Ertas, 1998; van Oudenaarden and Boxer,\n1999; Slater et al., 1997; Tessier and Slater, 2002) which\n\n\f30\n\nFIG. 17 Top Panel: Scanning-electron-microscope picture of\na single pore with ratchet longitudinal profile.

Bottom\npanel: Scanning-electron-microscope picture of a silicon wafer\npierced by practically identical pores about 1.5mm apart and\n1mm in diameter. This picture illustrates the enormous potential for particle separation of a parallel 3D ratchet architecture.

A fluid such as water containing immersed, suspended polystyrene particles is pumped back and forth\nwith no net bias through the 3D array of asymmetric\npores of Fig. 17. Such an artificial Brownian motor\nis thus kept far away from equilibrium by the periodically varying pressure across the membrane. Due to the\nasymmetry of the pores, the fluid develops asymmetric\nflow patterns (Kettner et al., 2000), thus providing the\nratchet-like 3D force profile in which a Brownian particle of finite size can both: (i) undergo Brownian diffusion into liquid layers of differing speed, and/or (ii) become reflected asymmetrically from the pore walls. Both\nmechanisms will then result in a driven non-equilibrium\nnet flow of particles. Note that the direction of the net\n\nFIG. 18 Microfluidic drift ratchet of Kettner et al.

For further\ndetails see Kettner et al. (2000).\n\nflow cannot be easily guessed a priori. Indeed, the direction of the Brownian motor current is determined by\nthe interplay of the Navier-Stokes flow in this engineered\ngeometry and hydrodynamic thermal fluctuations.\nA detailed quantitative interpretation of the experimental data is plagued by several complications such as\nthe influence of hydrodynamic interactions and, possibly,\nelectric response effects due to residual charge accumulation near the boundaries. A most striking feature of this\nsetup, however, is the distinct dependence of current reversals on particle size. The sharply peaked current-size\ncharacteristics curves of this directed flow, that is, the\ntheoretical flow vs. size prediction in Fig. 18 and the\nexperimental current-pressure characteristics in Fig. 19,\nsuggest a highly selective particle separation efficiency\n\n\f31\n(Kettner et al., 2000). This microfluidic artificial Brownian device has recently been implemented in experiments\nwith suspended polystyrene spheres of well defined diameters (100 nm, 320 nm, 530 nm and 1000 nm) by Matthias\nand M\u00fcller (2003): Their experimental findings are in\ngood qualitative agrement with the theory as shown in\nFig. 19.\nRemarkably, this device has advantageous 3D scaling\nproperties: A massively parallel architecture composed\nof about 1.7 million pores illustrated in Fig. 17, is capable to direct and separate suspended microparticles\nvery efficiently. For this reason, such type of devices\nhave clear potential for bio-medical separation applications and therapy use.\nThe separation and sorting of cellular or colloidal particles is definitely a topic attracting wide interest in different areas of biology, physical chemistry and soft matter\nphysics. The powerful toolbox of optical manipulation\n(Dholakia et al., 2007; Grier, 2003) uses the optical forces\nexerted on colloids by focussed laser beams to move and\ncontrol objects ranging in size from tens of nanometers to\nmicrometers. If the optical forces are sufficiently strong\nto rule transport, the stochastic Brownian forces play\nonly a minor role, so that transport occurs as a deterministic process with an efficiency close to unity, a circumstance known as (optical) peristalsis (Bleil et al., 2007;\nKoss and Grier, 2003). Such a scheme can then be implemented also to experimentally realize ratchet cellular\nautomata capable of performing logical operations with\ninteracting objects. All together, in combination with\nthis new optical technology, colloids provides ideal model\nsystems to investigate statistical problems near and far\naway from thermal equilibrium (Babic and Bechinger,\n2005; Babic et al., 2005).\n\nB. Transporting condensed phases\n\nMost present applications use ratchet concepts to\ntransport or filter discrete objects, like colloidal particles\nor macromolecules. However, ratchets may also serve to\ninduce macroscopic transport of a continuous phase using local gradients, only. One such realization, strongly\nrelated to the above cases of particle transport in a \"resting\" liquid phase, is the Brownian motion of magnetic\nparticles in ferrofluids subjected to an oscillating magnetic field (Engel and Reimann, 2004). In contrast to\nthe cases reported above, here the motion is also transmitted to the solvent by viscous coupling.\nAnother class of systems does not require colloidal particles to drive the motion of the liquid phase. In a first\nexample, a secondary large scale mean flow is triggered\nin Marangoni-B\u00e9nard convection over a solid substrate\nwith asymmetric grooves (Stroock et al., 2003). The direction and strength of the mean flow can be controlled\nby changing the thickness of the liquid layer and the temperature gradient across the layer.\nYet another intriguing situation involves self-propelled\n\nLeidenfrost drops placed on a hot surface also with a\nratchet-like grooved profile (Fig. 20). The locally asymmetric geometry of the support induces a directed drop\nmotion. This effect has been observed for many liquids\nand in wide temperature ranges within the film boiling\n(Leidenfrost) regime (Linke et al., 2006; Qu\u00e9r\u00e9 and Ajdari, 2006).\nMoreover, micro-drops confined to the gap between\nasymmetrically structured plates, move when drop shape\nor wetting properties are changed periodically, for instance by vibrating the substrate, applying an on/off\nelectric field across the gap or a low-frequency zero-mean\nelectric field along the gap (Buguin et al., 2002; Gorre\net al., 1996). In a related experiment the motion of drops\non a global wettability gradient resulted to be strongly\nenhanced when a periodic force was applied (Daniel et al.,\n2004). In that work the ratchet aspect was determined\nby the intrinsically asymmetric shape of the drops and\nthe hysteresis of their contact angle on the gradient substrate.\nThe theory for particle transport operated by Brownian motors is presently well developed (Astumian, 1997;\nAstumian and H\u00e4nggi, 2002; H\u00e4nggi and Bartussek,\n1996; H\u00e4nggi et al., 2005; J\u00fclicher et al., 1997; Reimann\nand H\u00e4nggi, 2002). In clear contrast, models for ratchetdriven transport of a continuous phase are a rather scarce\ncommodity, although the concept is thought to be important for emerging microfluidic applications (Squires and\nQuake, 2005).\nIn recent work, a model for the flow of two immiscible layered liquids confined between two walls and driven\nby a flashing \"wettability ratchet\" has been put forward\nby John and Thiele (2007) and John et al. (2008). In\ndoing so, one employs the general concept of wettability\ncomprising all effective interactions between the liquidliquid free interface and the solid walls. Notably, any interaction that is applicable in a time-periodic, spatially\nperiodic (but locally asymmetric) fashion, is capable to\ndrive a flow, i.e. will result in directed transport. There\nexist several possibilities for experimental realizations of\nspatially inhomogeneous and time switching interactions.\nA practical setup consists of thin films of dielectric liquids in a capacitor with a periodic, locally asymmetric\nvoltage profile, that can be periodically switched on and\noff. A spatially homogeneous electric field would destabilize the interface between two dielectric liquids. Therefore, an on-off ratchet with a constant lateral force can\nresult in the dewetting-spreading cycle sketched in Fig.\n21. The process underlying this motor scheme may be\ntermed \"electro-dewetting\".\n\nC. Granular flows\n\nThe concept of ratchet physics had found an early application in the field of granular matter (Jaeger et al.,\n1996). Indeed, to explain the vertical grain size segregation under vibration, the so-called Brazil-nut effect\n\n\f32\n\nFIG. 19 (Color online) Parallel Brownian motors in a macroporous silicon membrane containing ca. 1.7 million asymmetric\npores with 17 etched modulations each (see Fig. 17, top panel). Left panel: When the pressure oscillations of the water\nare switched on, the measured photoluminescence signal and thus the number of particles in the basin located to the right,\nsee top panel of Fig. 18, increases linearly in time, corresponding to a finite transport velocity. In contrast, for symmetric\ncylindrical-shaped pores no net drift is observed. Right panel: The experimentally observed net transport behavior strongly\ndepends on the amplitude of the applied pressure and qualitatively shows the theoretically predicted current inversion (Kettner\net al., 2000).

Other experimental parameters are as follows: the\nsuspended luminescent polystyrene spheres in water are 0.32\u03bcm across, the frequency of the pressure oscillations is 40Hz and\nthe root mean square (RMS) of the applied pressure during the 'on' phase is 2000Pa. A control experiment using straight\ncylindrical pores with a diameter of 2.4\u03bcm showed no directed Brownian motor transport.

In the meantime, this problem spurred several computer simulations aimed at exploring the wonderful world of granular ratchets. Another unusual phenomenon, observed both experimentally and in computer\nsimulations, is horizontal size segregation. It involves the\noccurrence of horizontal flows of granular layers that are\n\nThe spontaneous anelastic clustering of a vibrofluidized granular gas has been employed, for instance, to\ngenerate phenomena such as granular fountains (convection rolls) and ratchet transport in compartmentalized containers, where symmetry breaking flow patterns\nemerge perpendicular to the direction of the energy input (Brey et al., 2001; Eggers, 1999; Farkas et al., 2002;\nvan der Meer et al., 2004). Granular systems exhibit\nindeed a rich scenario of intriguing collective transport\nphenomena, which have been tested and validated both\ncomputationally and experimentally (van der Meer et al.,\n2007).\nAll these systems are kept away from thermal equilibrium by vertical vibrations, while the presence of random\nperturbations play a role as a source of complexity, due to\nthe intrinsic chaotic nature of granular dynamics. Closer\nin spirit of the present review are, however, those devised granular Brownian motors which are truly capable\nto tame thermal Brownian motion (Cleuren and Van den\nBroeck, 2007; Costantini et al., 2007, 2008). In those setups, an asymmetric object of mass m (Fig. 22), is free to\nslide, without rotation, in a given direction. Its motion\nwith velocity v is induced by dissipative collisions with\na dilute gas of surrounding particles of average temperature T . On each collision, only a certain fraction (called\nrestitution coefficient) of the total kinetic energy of the\nobject-particle system is conserved. At variance with the\n\n\f33\n\nFIG. 21 (Color online) Panels (a) to (c) illustrate the working principle of a fluidic ratchet based on dewetting-spreading\ncycles.

(2008).\n\ncase of elastic collisions, here isotropy, implying hvi = 0,\nand energy equipartition, implying hv 2 i = kT /m, do not\napply: Dissipation is responsible for breaking the time\nreversal symmetry. As a result one finds that the asymmetric object undergoes (approximately) a directed random walk with nonzero average velocity, which can be\nmodeled in terms of an effective biased Langevin dynamics for the velocity variable v. Such a Langevin dynamics assumes the form of an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process\n(H\u00e4nggi and Thomas, 1982; Risken, 1984) governed by an\neffective Stokesian friction and an effective external force,\nboth depending on the restitution coefficient (Cleuren\nand Van den Broeck, 2007; Costantini et al., 2007). The\ndirected motion of the object is accompanied by a continuous flow of heat from the gas to the object, in order to\nbalance the dissipation of the collisional processes; as a\nconsequence the average temperature of the asymmetric\nobject is lower than the gas temperature.\nEver since the formulation of the second law of thermodynamics there has been haunting debates about its\nvalidity at the small scales. In this context the ratchet\ngadget invented by Smoluchowski (1912) and later beautifully popularized by Feynman et al. (1963) points at\nthe heart of a controversy, which concerns the very working principle of Brownian motors: To be consistent with\nthis law, no rectification of thermal fluctuations can take\nplace at thermal equilibrium for which all dynamics is intrinsically governed by the principle of detailed balance.\nA steadily working Brownian motors necessarily requires\n\nFIG. 22 (Color online) Taming thermal motion.

Several computer versions\nof Smoluchowski-Feynman ratchets operating in a dilute\ngas of colliding granular particles, have thus been confirmed to generate directed transport in the presence of\na finite temperature difference. With the possibility of\ntoday's observation and manipulation of physical, chemical and biological objects at the nano- and meso-scale,\nsuch devices no longer represent a theorist's thought experiment, but are rather becoming a physical reality. It\nis right on these length scales that thermal fluctuations\ncannot be ignored, as they combine with non-equilibrium\nforces to yield constructive transport.\n\nVII. SUPERCONDUCTING DEVICES\n\nMagnetic vortices in type-II superconducting devices\nprovide a flexible and experimentally accessible playground for testing our stochastic transport models. In\nrecent years an impressive effort has been directed toward\nthe design and operation of a new generation of vortex devices with potential applications to terahertz (THz) technology (Hechtfischer et al., 1997; Zitzmann et al., 2002),\nfluxon circuitry (Shal\u00f3m and Pastoriza, 2005), and quantum computation (You and Nori, 2005), to mention but a\nfew. We anticipate that magnetic vortices are inherently\nquantum objects that, under most experimental conditions, behave like (massless, point-like) classical particles. Genuine quantum effects in the vortex transport\nare briefly discussed in Sec. VIII.\nA magnetic field applied to a type-II superconduct-\n\n\f34\ning film, with intensity H comprised between the critical values Hc1 and Hc2 , penetrates into the sample producing supercurrent vortices, termed Abrikosov vortices\n(Abrikosov, 1957; Blatter et al., 1994). The supercurrent\ncirculates around the normal (i.e. non-superconducting)\ncore of the vortex; the core has a size of the order\nthe superconducting coherence length \u03be (parameter of\na Ginzburg-Landau theory); the supercurrents decay on\na distance \u03bb (London penetration depth) from the core.\nIn the following we assume that \u03bb \u001d \u03be. The circulating supercurrents produce magnetic vortices, each characterized by a total flux equal to a single flux quantum\n\u03a60 = hc/2e (hence the name fluxon for magnetic vortex)\nand a radially decaying magnetic field\nB(r) = B0 K0 (r/\u03bb),\n\n(39)\n\nwhere K0 (x) is a modified Bessel function of zero-th order and B0 = \u03a60 /(2\u03c0\u03bb2 ). Far from the vortex core,\nrp \u001d \u03bb, the field decays exponentially, B(r)/B0 =\n\u03bb\u03c0/2r e\u2212r/\u03bb , whereas, approaching the vortex center,\nit diverges logarithmically for \u03be < r \u001c \u03bb, B(r)/B0 =\nln(\u03bb/r), and then saturates at B(0) = B0 ln(\u03bb/\u03be) inside\nthe core r < \u03be. As a consequence, the coupling between\nvortex supercurrents and magnetic fields determines a\nlong range repulsive vortex-vortex interaction.\nDue to mutual repulsion, fluxons form a lattice (also\ncalled Abrikosov vortex lattice, usually triangular, possibly with defects and dislocations) with average vortex\ndensity \u03c1 approximately equal to H/\u03a60 . A local density I of either a transport current or a magnetization\ncurrent or both, exerts on each fluxon a Lorentz force\nFL = \u03a60 I \u00d7 H/(cH).\nThe distribution and microscopic properties of pinning\ncenters can qualitatively influence the thermodynamic\nand vortex transport properties of the superconducting\nsample. Pinning forces created by isolated defects in the\nmaterial oppose the motion of the fluxons, thus determining a critical (or threshold) current, below which the\nvortex motion is suppressed. Many kinds of artificial pinning centers have been proposed and developed to increase the critical current, ranging from the dispersal of\nsmall non-superconducting second phases to creation of\ndefects by irradiation (Altshuler and Johansen, 2004). A\nnovel approach to the problem came with advances in\nlithography, which allowed for regular structuring and\nmodulation of the sample properties over a large surface\narea (Harada et al., 1996). Long-range correlation in the\nposition of the pinning centers resulted in the interplay\nbetween the length scales characterizing the pin lattice\nand the vortex lattice. Indeed, the magnitude of the commensuration effects is readily controlled by tuning the intensity of the magnetic field H: at the first matching field\nH1 = \u03a60 /al , pin and vortex lattices are exactly commensurate, with one fluxon per pin lattice cell of area al ; at\nthe n-th matching field, H(n) = nH1 , each pin lattice\ncell is occupied by n = \u03c1al fluxons; for irrational H/H1\npin and vortex lattices are incommensurate. Commensuration effects are responsible for a variety of dynamical\n\nsuperconducting states of great relevance to the problem\nof vortex rectification (Reichhardt et al., 1998).\nAs a first attempt to design a vortex ratchet Lee et al.\n(1999) showed that an ac electric current applied to a\nsuperconductor patterned with the asymmetric pinning\npotential shown in Fig. 23, can induce vortex transport\nwhose direction is determined only by the asymmetry of\nthe pattern. The fluxons were treated as zero-mass pointlike particles moving on a saw-tooth potential along the\nx-axis, according to the scheme of Sec. II.D.1. These authors demonstrated theoretically that, for an appropriate choice of the pinning potential, such a rocked ratchet\ncan be used to manipulate single vortices in superconducting samples under realistic conditions. The rectification mechanisms of an extended overdamped string,\nlike a fluxon, on a ratchet potential had been anticipated\nby Marchesoni and coworkers (Costantini et al., 2002;\nMarchesoni, 1996). Brownian motor ratcheting of single\noscillating fluxons have been observed experimentally in\nasymmetrically etched Nb strips (Plourde et al., 2000),\non planar patterns of columnar defect (Kwok et al.,\n2002), and in asymmetric linear arrays of underdamped\nJosephson junctions (Lee, 2003), in an annular Josephson junction (Ustinov et al., 2004), to mention just a few\nrecent experiments.\n\nFIG. 23 (Color online) Diagram of a superconductor in the\npresence of an external magnetic field H. A direct current\nwith density I flowing along the y direction (indicated by the\nlarge arrow) induces a Lorentz force FL that moves the vortex in the x direction (upper panel). The superconductor is\npatterned with a pinning potential (lower panel). The potential is periodic and asymmetric along the x direction, and is\ninvariant under translation along y; the potential V (x) is an\neffective ratchet potential (see Sec. II.D).\n\nA. Fluxon channels\n\nA more viable approach to achieve controllable\nstochastic transport of fluxons in superconducting devices consists in exploiting collective boundary effects as\nsuggested Sec. V.A.1. Fluxon rectification in asymmetric channels has been investigated by Wambaugh et al.\n(1999) by means of a molecular dynamics (MD) code,\noriginally developed to study magnetic systems with random and correlated pinning (Reichhardt et al., 1998).\n\n\f35\nThey simulated a thin slice of a zero-field cooled, typeII superconducting slab, taken orthogonally to the magnetic vortex lines generated by a tunable external magnetic field of intensity H. On regarding them as fairly\nrigid field structures, magnetic vortices formed a confined 2D gas of zero-mass repelling particles with density\n\u03c1 = H/\u03a60 . The simulated sample had very strong, effectively infinite pinning except the \"zero pinning\" central\nsawtooth-shaped channel, sketched in the inset of Fig.\n24. In the channel fluxons moved subject to fluxon-fluxon\nrepulsions, an externally applied ac driving Lorentz force,\nforces due to thermal fluctuations, and strong damping.\nThe fluxons outside the channel could not move, thus\nimpeding the movable fluxons in the middle to cross the\nchannel walls. As a consequence, the interaction length\nof the fluxon-wall collisions was the same as of the fluxonfluxon collisions. The net fluxon velocity hvi versus temperature shown in Fig. 24 is negative and exhibits an\napparent resonant behavior, both versus T and H (i.e.,\nthe fluxon density \u03c1), as anticipated in Sec. V.A.1.\nThese conclusions have been recently corroborated experimentally by Togawa et al. (2005) and then by Yu\net al. (2007). The authors of the more recent work fabricated triangular channels from bilayer films of amorphous niobium-germanium, an extremely weak-pinning\nsuperconductor, and niobium nitride (NbN), with relatively strong pinning. A reactive ion etching process removed NbN from regions as narrow as 100 nm, defined\nwith electron-beam lithography, to produce weak-pinning\nchannels for vortices to move through easily. In contrast,\nvortices trapped in the NbN banks outside of the channels remain strongly pinned. The vortex motion through\nsuch asymmetric channels exhibited interesting asymmetries in both the static depinning and the dynamic flux\nflow. The vortex ratchet effect thus revealed a even richer\ndependence on magnetic field and driving force amplitude than anticipated by the simplified model simulated\nby Wambaugh et al. (1999).\nDevices like that simulated in Fig. 24 serve as excellent\nfluxon rectifiers. By coupling two or more such devices,\none can design fluxon lenses, to regulate the fluxons concentration in chosen regions of a sample, and eventually\nchannel networks or circuits, for fluxons in superconducting films.\nFluxon channeling was observed experimentally for the\nfirst time in an effective 1D vortex rectifier by Villegas\net al. (2003). Their device has the pedagogical merit\nof showing all collective transport effects summarized in\nSec. V at work. A 100\u03bcm thick Niobiun film was grown\non an array of nanoscale triangular pinning potentials\noriented as in Fig. 25 (top panel), with bases lined up\nalong the x-axis and vertices pointing in the y-direction.\nMagneto-resistance R(H) experiments were done with a\nmagnetic field H applied perpendicular to the substrate\nin a liquid Helium system. The dc magneto-resistance\ncurves in the bottom panel of Fig. 25 exhibit commensurability effects in which dissipation minima develop as\na consequence of the geometrical matching between the\n\nFIG. 24 (Color online) Rectified average fluxon velocity hvi\n(in units of \u03bb/\u03c4 ) versus T for the sawtooth channel geometry\nin the inset (width: 7\u03bb, bottleneck: \u03bb).

A vertically applied alternating\ncurrent square wave drives the fluxons back and forth horizontally along the channel with period \u03c4 = 100 MD steps. The\nnumber of fluxons per unit cell is: 1 (circles), 25 (diamonds),\n50 (squares), 75 (triangles), 100 (\u00d7), 150 (+), 250 (*). [After\nWambaugh et al. (1999)].\n\nvortex lattice and the underlying periodic structure. At\nthese matching fields, the vortex lattice motion slows\ndown, and R(H) minima appear at the equally spaced\nvalues H(n) = nH1 , with H1 = 32 Oe. The R(H) minima are sharp at the n = 1, 2, 3 matching fields, but shallow and not well-defined for higher n. This effect is a\nconsequence of the appearance of interstitial vortices at\nincreasing H beyond H3 , three being the maximum number of vortices contained in each triangle.\nIn order to interpret the experimental results, one separates all vortices in two groups: (i) pinned vortices,\nwhich move from one triangular-shaped pinning trap to\nanother one and, thus, are directly affected by an effective 1D rocked ratchet substrate with positive polarity\nin the y-direction; and (ii) interstitial vortices, which are\nchanneled in-between triangles and do not directly interact with the pinning traps (Savel'ev et al., 2003; Zhu\net al., 2003a). However, as apparent in the top panel of\nFig. 25 and discussed in Sec. V.C, pinned vortices, being\nstrongly coupled to the substrate potential, determine a\nweaker mean-field potential that acts on the interstitials\nwith opposite asymmetry (Savel'ev et al., 2003). As a\nconsequence, when all fluxons are subjected to the same\nac drive force, the fluxon-fluxon repulsion pushes the interstitials in the direction opposite to the pinned vortices\n(for an animation see http://dml.riken.go.jp/vortex).\nThe effects of this mechanism are illustrated in Fig.\n26. At constant temperature (close to Tc to avoid random pinning) and H multiple of H1 , an ac current density I(t) = Iac sin(\u03a9t) was injected along the x-axis. This\nyields a sinusoidal Lorentz force with amplitude FL acting on the vortices along the y-axis. Despite the zero\n\n\f36\n\nFIG. 25 (Color online) Top panel: Sketch of the positions of the vortices for several matching fields H(n), i.e., for n vortices per\nunit cell. Vortices pinned on the triangles (no more than 3 per unit cell) are shown in red and interstitial vortices in blue. The\npinning substrate is a square lattice with constant 750nm; the triangular pinning sites have been grown on a Si support, are\n40nm thick with side about 600nm long. Bottom panel: dc magneto-resistance R(H) versus H. The temperature is T = 0.98Tc\nand the injected dc current density is Idc = 12.5kA * cm\u22122 . The upper inset shows a micrograph of the measuring bridge, which\nis 40\u03bcm wide. The darker central area of the inset is the 90 \u00d7 90\u03bcm2 array of magnetic triangles. The lower inset shows the\ncharacteristics curves Vdc -Idc at the matching magnetic fields H(n) = nH1 with H1 = 32Oe and n = 1 (red), 3 (cyan), 4 (blue),\n6 (green), 8 (magenta), and 10 (black). The V (Idc ) curves change abruptly at magnetic fields from n = 3 to n = 4, because\nan ohmic regime appears at low currents. This is a clear signature of the presence of interstitial vortices. [After Villegas et al.\n(2003)].\n\ntime average of such Lorentz force, a non-zero dc voltage drop Vdc in the x-direction was measured, thus proving that the vortices actually drift in the y-direction.\nNote that, due to the peculiar substrate symmetry, an\nac current I(t) oscillating along the y-axis, can rectify\nthe fluxon motion only parallel to it (transverse rectification, Sec. VII.B). The amplitude of the dc voltage signal\ndecreases with increasing H because the effective pinning is suppressed by the inter-vortex repulsion. Moreover, when n > 3 (corresponding to more than three\nvortices per unit cell), a reversed Vdc signal begins to\ndevelop with a maximum (marked by blue arrows) occurring at a lower Lorentz force FL than the positive dc\nmaxima (red arrows): The interstitials, which feel a weak\ninverted ratchet potential with respect to the pinned vortices, dominate the rectification process. This current\nreversal effect is enhanced when further increasing the\nmagnetic field [panels (c) and (d)] and finally, at very\nhigh magnetic fields, close to the normal state, the voltage reversal, although suppressed in magnitude, spans\nover the entire FL range [panel (f)].\nMoshchalkov and coworkers (Silva et al., 2006; de Vondel et al., 2007) also demonstrated longitudinal fluxon\nrectification. Silva et al. (2006) observed multiple current reversals in regular square lattices of asymmetric\ndouble-well traps periodically driven along an \"easy\" direction, as in the simulations by Zhu et al. (2003a,b).\nMore interestingly, de Vondel et al. (2007) have detected\ninverted fluxon currents in large triangular arrays, similar\nto those reviewed here, but at magnetic fields (or fluxon\ndensities) so high that a collective ratchet mechanism\nwould not be plausible. They attributed their finding to\n\na new intra-antidot rectification mechanism controlled by\nthe magnetic flux quantization condition synchronously\nsatisfied at the edge of each asymmetric antidot.\n\nB. Fluxon rectification in 2D arrays\n\nThe rectification of a fluxon lattice, no matter how distorted or disordered, is an inherently 2D process. Following the theoretical and numerical investigations reviewed\nin Sec. V.B, a number of experimental groups (Crisan\net al. (2005); Menghini et al. (2007); Van Look et al.\n(2002) to mention a few) prototyped devices aimed at\ncontrolling vortex ratcheting both in the direction parallel (longitudinal rectifiers) and perpendicular to an applied ac Lorentz force (transverse rectifiers).\nLongitudinal transport in a 2D array of asymmetric\npinning traps has been experimentally obtained, for instance, by de Vondel et al. (2005), who reported that,\nunder appropriate operating conditions, fluxon rectification can be enhanced for FL amplitudes comprised between two critical pinning forces of the underlying asymmetric substrate. The shape of the net dc voltage drop\nVdc as a function of the drive amplitude indicated that\ntheir vortex ratchet behaved in a way very different from\nstandard overdamped models. Rather, as the repinning\nforce necessary to stop vortex motion, is considerably\nsmaller than the depinning force, their device resembles\nthe behavior of the inertial ratchets of Sec. II.D.1. More\nrecently, Shal\u00f3m and Pastoriza (2005) reported longitudinal fluxon rectification in square arrays of Josephson\njunctions, where the coupling energies had been period-\n\n\f37\n\nFIG. 26 (Color online) (a)-(f) Net velocity hvi of vortices versus the amplitude FL of the ac Lorentz force for \u03a9 = 10kHz\nand different matching magnetic fields H(n); other parameter\nvalues are as in Fig. 25. Red and blue arrows show the direction of the net flow, dominated respectively, by the pinned\nand the interstitial vortices (see panel (a) of Fig. 25). [After\nVillegas et al. (2003).\n\nically modulated along one symmetry axis. Similarly,\nlongitudinal fluxon rectification has been observed also\nin square arrays of magnetic antidots with size-graded\nperiod (Gillijns et al., 2007). Both are nice experimental\nimplementations of the asymmetric patterns of symmetric traps introduced in Sec. V.A.2. Finally, Ooi et al.\n(2007) trapped symmetric fluxon lattices in a triangular dot lattice, they had photo-lithographed on a thin\nBi2 Sr2 CaCu2 O8+\u03b4 (Bi2212) single-crystal film, by setting the applied magnetic field at the lowest multiples\nof H1 . By subjecting the fluxon lattice to a bi-harmonic\nLorentz force oriented along the crystallographic axes of\nthe dot lattice, they obtained a neat demonstration of\nharmonic mixing on a symmetric substrate. However,\nalso the results of these experiments can be easily explained in terms of simple 1D models.\nTransverse transport, instead, requires genuinely irreducible 2D geometries. When designing and operating a\ndevice capable of transverse rectification, experimenters\ncan vary the orientation of the pinning lattice axes, the\nsymmetry axes of the individual traps (if any) and the direction of the injected current (i.e., of the Lorentz force).\nMany authors explored by numerical simulation the geometries best suitable for the experimental implementation of this concept (Olson Reichhardt and Reichhardt,\n2005; Zhu et al., 2001). The most recent realizations of\ntransverse fluxon rectifiers fall into two main categories:\n(i) Symmetric arrays of asymmetric traps. Gonzalez\n\net al. (2007) modified the experimental set-up of Villegas et al. (2003) to investigate the rectification mechanisms presented in Secs. V.A and V.B. They confirmed\nthe numerical simulations by Savel'ev et al. (2005), who\nhad predicted that the same device can exhibit either\nlongitudinal or transverse output current depending on\norientation of the ac drive with respect to the pinning\nlattice axes. In the longitudinal ratchet configuration a\nsinusoidal driving current I(t) was applied perpendicular\nto the triangle reflection symmetry axis (x-axis) and the\noutput voltage signal Vdc was recorded in the same direction. We recall that the Lorentz force induced vortex\nmotion, parallel to the triangle reflection symmetry axis\n(y-axis), corresponds to a voltage drop in the direction\nof the injected current. To observe an optimal transverse\nrectification effect, the axes of the current injection and\nthe voltage drop were inverted. The asymmetry of the\ntraps with respect to the direction of the Lorentz force is\nresponsible for the observed fluxon drift in the y direction.\nThe number n of vortices per lattice cell was controlled\nby varying the intensity of the magnetic field orthogonal\nto the device, H = nH1 . On increasing n, the voltage associated to the longitudinal ratchet current changes sign\nand gets amplified, as to be expected due to the presence of the n \u2212 3 interstitials per unit cell (Sec. VII.A).\nThe H dependence the transverse fluxon rectification is\nvery different: (a) the transverse net current shows no\ninversions; (b) increasing the number of the interstitials\ntransverse rectification is suppressed.\n(ii) Asymmetric arrays of symmetric traps. Controlled\ntransport of vortices through rows of antidots was measured by W\u00f6rdenweber et al. (2004) via standard 4probe Hall-type experiments (Altshuler and Johansen,\n2004). 100-150nm thin YBa2 Cu3 O2 (YBCO) films were\ndeposited on CeO2 buffered sapphire and then covered\nwith a 50nm thick Au layer. Asymmetric lattices of symmetric antidots in the shope of circular micro-holes, were\npatterned via optical lithography and ion beam etching.\nThe inset of Fig. 27 shows a typical antidot lattice. A\ntunable dc current Idc was then injected so that the corresponding Lorentz force FL was at an angle \u03b3 with respect\nto the orientation of the antidot rows.\nReference measurements on samples without antidots\nas well as temperature-dependent measurements of the\nHall resistance RH for different angles \u03b3 clearly indicate\nthat for T < 83K and low dc drive current, the Hall resistance is dominated by the directed vortex motion along\nthe antidot rows. Under this circumstances, RH quantifies the fluxon current in the direction of the dc current\nIdc (with negative Hall voltage), or equivalently, transverse to the drive force FL . In view of the symmetry of\nthe traps, for currents perpendicular to the antidot rows,\nno transverse fluxon current was observed; as shown in\nFig. 27, changing the sign of \u03b3 led to a inversion of\nthe transverse current. Most notably, the detected drift\nwas not restricted by a current threshold, that is, fluxons\nseemed not to jump from antidot to antidot, like individ-\n\n\f38\n\nFIG. 27 Angular dependence of RH measured on a circular\nshaped 90nm thick sample at T = 30K, H = 143mT and\nwith dc current Idc = 10mA. Inset: portion of a 20\u03bcm\u00d710\u03bcm\nrectangular lattice of circular antidots with radius of 1\u03bcm; Idc\nis horizontally oriented from left to right corresponding to a\nLorentz force FL pointing upwards. The angular dependence\nis fitted by the sinusoidal law sin 2\u03b3, as sketched in the inset.\n[After W\u00f6rdenweber et al. (2004)].\n\nual vortices in a defective superconductor sample (Sec.\nV.A.2), but rather obey an Ohmic behavior. The absence\nof an activation threshold was explained in W\u00f6rdenweber\net al. (2004) by invoking a combination of (i) finite size\neffects, as the area where vortices can be nucleated is\nseverely restricted by the device geometry; (ii) screening\neffects, as trapped fluxons induce spatially non-uniform\ncurrent distributions around neighboring antidots. Due\nto current screening, the antidot rows serve as easy-flow\n(i.e., threshold-less) paths for the driven vortices, which\nthus acquire a transverse velocity proportional to sin 2\u03b3\n(see Fig. 27, inset and main panel).\nAt higher temperatures and stronger drives, this effect\nbecomes negligible and no transverse rectification was detected (W\u00f6rdenweber et al., 2004). Moreover, on replacing Idc with a symmetric ac drive Iac (t), no net current\nis expected, neither longitudinal nor transversal.\n\nC. Anisotropic fluxon rectifiers\n\nTransport control in a binary mixture can be achieved\nin samples with no ratchet substrate. As reported in Sec.\nV.C, when one of the components of the binary mixture\nis driven, the moving particles drag along the other nondriven component, interacting with it. A time asymmetric ac drive produces rectification of both components of\nthe binary mixture, which can be tuned by means of the\nac drive parameters. The device acts like a ratchet, but\nit has no ratchet substrate.\nSavel'ev and Nori (2002) proposed to implement this\nnew ratchet concept in a layered superconductor. In this\nclass of materials, a magnetic field, tilted away from the\n\nFIG. 28 (Color online) Vortex lens. Subjected to a superposition of dc and time asymmetric ac in-plane magnetic fields,\nH|| (t) = H||dc +H||ac (t), the JV (horizontal cylinders) are asymmetrically pushed in and out of the sample. If the ac component of H|| (t) increases slowly, the PV stacks (pancakes)\nremain trapped on the JV, and both move together towards\nthe center of the lens [panel (a)]. If, on the way back, H||ac (t)\ndecreases rapidly, the JV leave the PV behind them [(panel\n(b)]. Courtesy of Sergey Savel'ev.\n\nhigh-symmetry crystalline c-axis, penetrates the sample\nas two perpendicular vortex arrays (Grigorenko et al.,\n2001; Matsuda et al., 2001; Ooi et al., 1999), known as\n\"crossing\" vortex lattices (Koshelev, 1999). One vortex sublattice consists of stacks of pancake vortices (PV)\naligned along the c-axis, whereas the other is formed by\nJosephson vortices (JV) confined between CuO2 layers\n(Fig. 28). A weak attractive PV-JV interaction has\nbeen experimentally observed (Grigorenko et al., 2001).\nThe JV are usually very weakly pinned and can be easily driven by changing either the in-plane magnetic field,\nH|| , or applying an electrical current, Iz , flowing along\nthe c-axis.\nTime-asymmetrically driven JV can drag along the\nPV, resulting in a net motion of the PV, as in the PV lens\ndevice illustrated schematically in Fig. 28. The simplest\npossible operating mode consists of slowly increasing the\nin-plane field, H|| , from 0 to H||max for a fixed value of the\nout-of-plane magnetic field, Hz . The increasing in-plane\nfield slowly drives the JV from the edges to the middle of\nthe sample. In turn, the JV drag the PV along with them\ntowards the sample center. As a result, asymmetrically\ncycling causes either pumping (focusing) or antipumping\n(defocusing) of the PV at the center of the lens.\nCole et al. (2006) actually performed a vortex lensing experiment on an as-grown single Bi2212 crystal.\nThe changes in magnetic induction, arising from PV\nlensing/anti-lensing, were detected using one centrally\nplaced element of a micro-Hall probe array (Altshuler\nand Johansen, 2004). In order to realize the asymmetric\nac driven mode for the vortex lens, the following steps\n\n\f39\nsketched in Fig. 29 were carried out: (1) The sample\nwas cooled in fixed Hz at H|| = 0; (2) A \"conditioning\"\ntriangular wave was run for 4 min to equilibrate the PV\nsystem; (3) A time-asymmetric, zero-mean ac drive, was\nswitched on for 4 min (for an animation see http:\ndml.riken.go.jp). The magnetic induction, Bz , was then\nmonitored in real time starting from step (2) at a centrally located Hall element and then related to the local\nPV density. The measured efficiency of this vortex lens,\ndisplayed in Fig. 29, is quite low. However, the same\nexperiment, when performed on a symmetric substrate,\nyields a much higher efficiency, as recently proven by Cole\net al. (2006) for a film of Bi2212 patterned with a square\narray of circular antidots.\nThe two main advantages of this class of vortex devices over the earlier proposals reviewed in Secs. VII.A\nand VII.B are: (1) the possibility to guide particles with\nno tailored spatial asymmetry; (2) the tuning of the vortex motion by simply changing the parameters of the externally applied drive. The first feature allows to avoid\nexpensive and cumbersome nanofabrication processing;\nthe second property becomes very important if the transport properties of a device must be frequently varied,\nsomething which is generally hard to achieve in standard\nratchet devices.\n\nclassical statistical fluctuations. Totally new scenarios\nopen up when we try to consistently incorporate quantum mechanical laws in the operation of an artificial\nBrownian motor. The quantum nature of fluctuations\nand the quantum evolution laws, as governed by quantum statistical mechanics, allow for unexpected transport mechanisms. In particular, quantum mechanics provides the doorway to new features such as under-barrier(threshold) tunneling, above barrier-reflection and the interplay of coherent (i.e. with oscillatory relaxation) and\nincoherent (i.e. with overdamped relaxation) quantum\ntransport. Last but not least, quantum mechanics generates the possibility for non-classical correlations, including entanglement among quantum states in presence of\ncoupling.\n\nA. Quantum dissipative Brownian transport\n\nTo set the stage and in order to elucidate the complexity involving directed quantum Brownian transport, we\nconsider a 1D quantum particle of coordinate q and mass\nm, moving in a typically time-dependent rachet-like potential landscape VR (q, t). The particle is bi-linearly coupled with strength ci to a set of N harmonic oscillators\nxi , with i = 1, . . . , N . The latter set of oscillators models the heat bath, with the oscillators being prepared in a\ncanonical state with density matrix \u03c1\u0302bath , corresponding\nto an isolated, bare bath Hamiltonian and a temperature\nkT . Accordingly, the total dynamics is governed by the\nHamiltonian:\nH=\n\nFIG. 29 (Color online) Vortex lens operation. The curves\nshow the measured percentage change of the magnetic induction (PV density) at the samples center, when applying an\ninitial conditioning signal followed by pumping/antipumping\ntime-asymmetric drives. The conditioned PV density increases (decreases) during several cycles of the pumping (antipumping) drive and then saturates. As soon as the drive\nis switched off, the PV density starts to relax from the nonequilibrium pumping (antipumping) state towards an equilibrium state. Courtesy of Sergey Savel'ev.\n\nVIII.

This Hamiltonian\nhas been studied since the early Sixties for systems which\nare weakly coupled to their environment. Only in the\nEighties it was realized by Caldeira and Leggett (Caldeira\nand Leggett, 1983, 1984) that this model is also applicable to strongly damped systems and may be employed to\ndescribe, for example, dissipative tunneling in solid state\nand chemical physics (H\u00e4nggi et al., 1990).\nOne may convince oneself that the Hamiltonian in Eq.\n(40) models indeed dissipation. Making use of the solution of the Heisenberg equations of motion for the external degrees of freedom, one derives a reduced system\noperator-valued equation of motion, the so-called inertial\ngeneralized quantum Langevin equation, that is\n\n\f40\n\nZ\n\nt\n\nds\u03b3(t \u2212 s)q\u0307(s)\n\nmq\u0308(t) + m\nt0\n\n+\n\ndVR (q, t)\n= \u03b7(t) \u2212 m\u03b3(t \u2212 t0 )q(t0 ).\ndq\n\n(41)\n\nThe friction kernel is given by\nN\n\n\u03b3(t) = \u03b3(\u2212t) =\n\n1 X c2i\ncos(\u03c9i t),\nm i=1 mi \u03c9i2\n\nand the quantum Brownian force operator reads\n\u0012\nN\nX\n\u03b7(t) =\nci xi (t0 ) cos(\u03c9i [t \u2212 t0 ])\n\n(42)\n\n(43)\n\ni=1\n\n+\n\n\u0013\npi (t0 )\nsin(\u03c9i [t \u2212 t0 ]) ,\nmi \u03c9i\n\nFIG. 30 (a) Schematic picture of an asymmetric SQUID with\nthree junctions threaded by an external magnetic flux.

This is in clear\ncontrast to the classical models, where the Langevin dynamics is directly formulated in the system state space\n(H\u00e4nggi and Ingold, 2005). Caution applies in making approximations to this structure, even if done semiclassically. The interplay of quantum noise with the commutator structure is necessary to avoid inconsistencies\nwith the thermodynamic laws, such as a spurious finite\ndirected current in an equilibrium quantum ratchet, i.e.,\neven in absence of rocking, i.e., for VR (q, t) = VR (q)\n(H\u00e4nggi and Ingold, 2005; Machura et al., 2004a). Simplifications are possible only under specific circumstances\nlike in the case of very strong friction, when quantum corrections can consistently be accounted by a semiclassical\nquantum Smoluchowski equation operating on the state\nspace of the classical system, only (Ankerhold et al., 2001;\nMachura et al., 2004a, 2007b). The situation is presently\nless settled for weakly damped quantum Brownian motors (Carlo et al., 2005; Denisov et al., 2008) and for systems at high temperatures, where reduced descriptions\n\nare often in conflict with the laws of thermodynamics;\nthis is true in particular for the second law, central to\nthis review (H\u00e4nggi and Ingold, 2005; Zueco and GarciaPalacios, 2005).\nAn alternative approach to the quantum Langevin description, which in addition allows powerful computational methods, is based on the real time path integral\ntechnique. Starting from the quantum statistical representation of the density operator evolution of the total\ndynamics of a system coupled to its environment(s), one\ntraces over the bath degrees of freedom to end up with\na path integral representation for the reduced density\noperator, the so-called influence functional, which consistently incorporates quantum dissipation (see, for instance, (Grifoni and H\u00e4nggi, 1998; H\u00e4nggi and Ingold,\n2005; H\u00e4nggi et al., 1990; Kohler et al., 2005)).\n\nB. Josephson Brownian motors\n\nIn the following we consider the role of quantum effects\non artificial Brownian motors made of coupled Josephson\njunctions.\n\n1. Classical regime\n\nA first case refers to the limit when quantum coherence\nand tunneling events, such as photon-assisted tunneling,\ncan safely be neglected, which is often the case at sufficiently high temperatures. In this regime the description\nof Josephson quantum systems can well be approximated\nby an effective Fokker-Planck dynamics in the context\nof the Stewart-McCumber model (Barone and Patern\u00f2,\n1982), which includes effective parameters containing h\u0304.\nAn artificial Brownian motor then can be experimentally\nrealized for instance with the asymmetric superconduct-\n\n\f41\n\nFIG. 31 Theoretically evaluated dc current-voltage (Josephson relation: V0 = (h\u0304/2e) h\u03c6\u0307(t)i) characteristics for the\nSQUID ratchet of Fig. 30. Simulation parameters: (nonadiabatic) rocking frequency \u03c9 = 2h\u0304\u03a9/eRJl = 0.3, ac drive\namplitude A = I0 /Jl = 1.7, and different noise levels: D =\nekB T /h\u0304Jl = 0 (solid), 0.01 (dashed), and 0.5 (dotted). Inset:\nmagnified plot showing characteristics steps at fractional values of \u03c9 for D = 0. Here, R and Jl denote the resistance and\nthe critical current amplitude of the two identical Josephson\njunctions placed in the left branch of the device, cf. in Fig.\n30.\n\ning quantum interference device (SQUID) illustrated in\nFig. 30 (Zapata et al., 1996). In the overdamped regime,\nwhere capacitative effects can be ignored, such a device\nmaps precisely onto the rocked ratchet of Sec. II.D.1.\nUnder such operating conditions, the phase of the device is a classical variable which can be adequately described by the aforementioned \"resistively shunted junction\" model. Thermal Brownian motion at temperature\nT is included by adding Nyquist noise. The behavior of\nthe so induced rachet voltage is displayed in Fig. 31 for a\nnon-adiabatically rocked SQUID-ratchet (Zapata et al.,\n1996).\nThe results for this ratchet setup have been experimentally validated by use of high temperature superconducting dc SQUID's by the T\u00fcbingen group (Sterck et al.,\n2005, 2002; Weiss et al., 2000). In the meantime, several\nvariants of this scheme have been studied, both theoretically and experimentally, including fluxon ratchets of\nvarious designs (Beck et al., 2005; Berger, 2004; Carapella and Costabile, 2001; Falo et al., 2002; Lee, 2003;\nShal\u00f3m and Pastoriza, 2005; Zapata et al., 1998); cf. also\nSec. VII. Moreover, transport of fluxons in an extended,\nannular Josephson junction has been demonstrated by\nUstinov et al. (2004) also as a harmonic mixing effect.\n\n2. Quantum regime\n\nTo tackle true quantum effects, including quantum\ntunneling phenomena, we must resort to the theoretical scheme outlined in Sect. VIII.A. A first theoretical study of quantum ratchets has been pioneered by\n\nFIG. 32 The classical Brownian motor current Icl occurring\nin a dichotomously rocked ratchet potential, Eq. (23), of period L, is compared with the corresponding quantum Brownian motor current Iqm versus dimensionless inverse temperature T . The current is measured in units of [L\u03c90\u2217 ] with\n1\n\u03c90\u2217 = [4\u03c0 2 V0 /(L2 m)] 2 and temperature is measured in units\nof the (maximal) crossover temperature T0max occurring in the\nrocked potential landscape. Notably, in clear contrast to an\nadiabatically rocked classical Brownian motor, the quantum\ncurrent changes sign near T0max /T = 2.8 which is a manifestation of true quantum tunneling. For more details we refer\nto the original work by Reimann and H\u00e4nggi (1998).\n\nReimann et al. (1997) (see also (Reimann and H\u00e4nggi,\n1998)). For a regime with several (quasi)-bound states\nbelow a potential barrier one can evaluate the ratchet\ntunneling dynamics in terms of an effective action for the\nextremal bounce-solution (in combination with a fluctuation analysis around this bounce solution) to obtain the\ncorresponding tunneling rates. In Fig. 32 the result of\nsuch a quantum calculation is compared with the classical result for an adiabatically rocked quantum particle\nof mass m and coordinate q dwelling in a ratchet potential VR (q). Note that within a quantum Brownian motor\nscheme the role of mass m, i.e. the inertia, does enter the\nanalysis explicitly. The most distinctive quantum signature is a striking current reversal which emerges solely\nas a consequence of quantum tunneling under adiabatic\nrocking conditions. Moreover, in contrast to the classical\nresult, the directed current no longer vanishes as T tends\nto zero and additional resonance-like features show up.\nSuch a dependence of the current versus decreasing\ntemperature in a quantum Brownian motor has been corroborated experimentally for vortices moving in a quasi1D Josephson junction array with ratchet potential profile specially tailored so as to allow several bands below\nthe barrier (Majer et al., 2003). The experimental setup\nof this quantum ratchet device is displayed in Fig. 33.\nThe experimental findings are in good agreement with\nthe theoretical analysis reported by Grifoni et al. (2002).\n\n\f42\n\nFIG. 33 (Color online) Top left: Scanning electron picture\n(with enlargement on the right) of a strongly asymmetric array of a long, narrow network of Josephson junctions arranged\nin a rectangular lattice. This arrangement determines the potential shape felt by vortices. Bottom left: Schematic layout.\nThe Josephson junctions are represented by crosses, each network cell being delimited by four junctions. All arrays have a\nlength of 303 cells and a width of 5 cells, placed between solid\nsuperconducting electrodes (busbars). The vortices assume a\nlower energy in cells with larger area and smaller junctions.\nFigure provided by Milena Grifoni, University of Regensburg,\nGermany.\n\nC. Quantum dot ratchets\n\nAnother ideal resource to observe the interplay of (i)\nquantum Brownian motion, (ii) quantum dissipation,\nand (iii) non-equilibrium driving are semiconductor engineered quantum rectifiers. Composed of arrays of asymmetric quantum rectifiers (Linke et al., 1998), these devices operate on geometric and dynamical length scales\nranging between a few nanometers up to micrometers.\nThis class of devices allowed the first experimental validation of the distinctive features of quantum rectifiers,\nnamely, tunneling enhanced rachet current and tunneling induced current reversals, by Linke and collaborators\n(Linke et al., 2002, 1999). Their central results are illustrated in Fig. 34.\nTheir quantum Brownian motor consisted of a 2D\ngas of electrons moving at the interface of a fabricated,\nratchet-tailored GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructure. Its operating regime was achieved by adiabatically switching\non and off a square wave source-drain periodic voltage of\nfrequency 190Hz and amplitude of about 1mV. Recalling that for an adiabatically rocked classical ratchet of\nSec. II.D.1, noise induced transport exhibits no current\nreversals, things change drastically when quantum tunnelling enters into the dynamics. A true benchmark for\nthe quantum behavior of an adiabatically rocked Brownian motor is then the occurrence of a tunneling induced\nreversal at low temperatures (Reimann et al., 1997). This\ncharacteristic feature has been first experimentally verified with an electron quantum rocked ratchet by Linke\net al. (1999). Moreover, the current reversal reported\nin the top panel of Fig. 34 indicates the existence of\nparameter configurations where the current of a quantum Brownian motor vanishes. In correspondence to\n\nFIG. 34 (Color online) In an experimental quantum Brownian\nmotor driven by an adiabatic square-wave zero-mean rocking voltage, quantum tunneling can contribute to the electron current. Due to the underlying asymmetric potential\nstructure, the two opposite components to the time-averaged\ndriven current differ in magnitude, yielding a net quantum\nratchet current (Linke et al., 1999; Reimann et al., 1997).\nThe magnitudes can be individually controlled by tuning the\ntemperature. This in turn causes a tunneling induced current\nreversal (occurring near 1.5K in the top graph) that can be\nexploited to direct electrons along a priori designed routes\n(Linke et al., 1999). Below the current versus T graph is a\nscanning electron micrograph of the relevant quantum device.\nFigure provided by Heiner Linke, University of Oregon.\n\nsuch configurations, one can imagine to operate the device as a quantum refrigerator to separate \"cold\" from\n\"hot\" electrons in the absence of currents (Linke et al.,\n2002). At higher temperatures this and other asymmetric quantum-dot arrays, when subjected to unbiased ac\ndrives, exhibit incoherent quantum ratchet currents. Experimental such realizations using two-dimensional electron systems with broken spatial inversion symmetry are\nreported in Refs. (Lorke et al., 1998; Sassine et al., 2008;\nVidan et al., 2004). An even richer behavior of the quantum current, including for example multiple current reversals, emerges when this class of devices is operated in\nthe non-adiabatic ac regime, as revealed by recent theoretical studies (Goychuk et al., 1998a,b; Goychuk and\nH\u00e4nggi, 1998; Goychuk and H\u00e4nggi, 2005; Grifoni et al.,\n2002; Kohler et al., 2005).\nAs a second example of an artificial quantum dot Brownian motor, we consider an experimental double quantum\ndot device where both dots are independently coupled to\na nonequilibrium energy source which is given by a biased quantum point contact. Moreover, both quantum\ndots are embedded in independent electric circuits via a\ncommon central gate, marked by a \"C\" in the sketch of\n\n\f43\n\nFIG. 35 (Color online) (a) AFM micrograph of a double quantum dot device. Metal surface gates have a light color, black\nsquares mark source and drain regions. The black scale bar\nmarks the length of 1\u03bcm. (b) Schematic diagram: A biased\nquantum point contact (QPC) provides the nonequilibrium\nfluctuation source for driving a tunneling current IDQD in the\nasymmetric double quantum dot (DQD) (dashed two circles)\n(Khrapai et al., 2006). The asymmetry is induced via gate\nvoltages at the plunger gates 2 and 4. Figure provided by\nVadim S. Khrapai, Ludwig-Maximilian University, Munich,\nGermany.\n\nFig. 35. On breaking its internal symmetry by tuning\nthe dot gate voltages, this double quantum dot acts as a\nquantum ratchet device (Khrapai et al., 2006). For weak\ninterdot tunneling, detuning of the quantum dot energy\nlevels results in the localization of an electron in one dot,\nso that elastic electron transfer to the other dot is energetically forbidden. To operate as a quantum ratchet,\nthe device still requires a nonequilibrium energy source.\nTo this purpose, a strong tunable bias on the quantum\npoint contact induces nonequilibrium energy fluctuations\nacross the dividing central gate, thus promoting inelastic\ninterdot tunneling inside the Coulomb blockaded double quantum dot. This in turn leads to a net quantum\nratchet current flow, as plotted in Fig. 36. In the insets of\nthe same figure, the interdot tunneling process is sketched\nfor the right-to-left transition [m, n + 1] \u2212\u2192 [m + 1, n],\nwith asymmetry energy \u2206 \u2261 Em+1,n \u2212 Em,n+1 , and for\nthe opposite left-to-right transition with energy \u2212\u2206. Notably, a finite ratchet current is only observed if the electron energy states in the dots are detuned asymmetrically, i.e. when \u2206 6= 0. In contrast, a likely inelastic\nionization of one dot towards its adjacent lead, followed\nby recharging from the same lead, does not result in a net\ncurrent. The nonequilibrium energy fluctuations, carried\nby the quantum point contact electrons and absorbed by\nthe electrons in the double quantum dot, could either\nconsist of acoustic phonons, long wavelength photons or\nplasmons (Khrapai et al., 2006).\nThe technology available to generate 2D electron gases\ncan be generalized to ratchet not only charge but also\nspin carriers. The interplay of spatially periodic potentials, lateral confinement, spin-orbit or Zeeman-type interactions and ac driving then gives rise to directed spin\nratchet currents, as theoretically proposed in recent studies (Scheid et al., 2007a,b). Of particular experimental relevance is the recent theoretically predicted phe-\n\nnomenon of a spin current which emerges via an unbiased ac charge current driving a dc spin current in a\nnon-magnetic, dissipative spin quantum ratchet which\nis composed of an asymmetric periodic structure with\nRashba spin-orbit interactions (Flatte, 2008; Smirnov\net al., 2008). Remarkably, this spin current occurs although no magnetic fields are present.\nLikewise, substantial rectification of a spin current can\nalso be achieved by coupling impurities to spatially asymmetric Luttinger liquids under ac voltage rocking (Braunecker et al., 2007). The transport mechanism in those\nschemes is governed by coherent tunneling processes,\nwhich will be addressed in more detail in the following\nsubsection.\n\nFIG. 36 (Color online) Experimental quantum ratchet current IDQD measured through the double quantum dot as a\nfunction of its asymmetry energy \u2206. The energy source is a\nnearby quantum point contact biased with VQPC = \u22121.55 mV,\nsee in Fig. 35. An elastic contribution to IDQD is subtracted\n(Khrapai et al., 2006). The two insets sketch the corresponding inelastic tunneling processes which drive the ratchet current. Notably, this quantum ratchet current vanishes when no\nfinite zero asymmetry is present. Figure provided by Stefan\nLudwig, Ludwig-Maximilians-University, Munich, Germany.\n\nD. Coherent quantum ratchets\n\nThe study of quantum Brownian motors is far from\nbeing complete. Actually, there is an urgent need for\nfurther developments. In many cases the role of incoherent tunneling and coherent transport channels can not\nbe clearly separated. For quantum devices built bottomup with engineered molecules or artificial molecules such\nas quantum dots, the role of coherent quantum transport typically plays a dominant role, as other interactions\nlike electron-phonon processes turn out to be negligible.\nThe key transport process for quantum ratcheting is then\ndriven coherent quantum tunneling (Grifoni and H\u00e4nggi,\n1998; Kohler et al., 2005).\n\n\f44\n\nFIG. 37 Time-averaged current I (measured in units of the\nlead coupling strength e\u0393) as a function of the infrared drive\nangular frequency \u03a9 (measured in units of the tunneling matrix element \u2206 = 0.1eV between sites for a laser amplitude\nA = \u2206 (Lehmann et al., 2002). The inset displays the dependence of I on the static voltage drop, V , applied along\nthe molecule. Note that the current at zero voltage is finite,\nthereby indicating a ratchet effect. The driving frequency\nhere corresponds to the vertical arrow in the main panel.\n\n1. Quantum ratchets from molecular wires\n\nThis is the case of the quantum Brownian motors consisting of nanowires formed by asymmetric molecular\ngroups and subjected to infrared light sources (Lehmann\net al., 2002), or symmetric molecular wires with symmetry breaking now provided by irradiating the wire with\nharmonic mixing signals (Lehmann et al., 2003). The\ntheoretically predicted quantum ratchet current through\nan asymmetric molecular wire irradiated by far-infrared\nlight is displayed in Fig. 37.\nIn these class of quantum ratchets transport proceeds\ncoherently between two or more fermionic leads that ensure the dissipative mechanism for the transported electrons to relax towards equilibrium Fermi distributions.\nSuch a ratchet current can as well be used to sensitively\nprobe the role of the electron correlations in the leads, as\nit is the case with a ratchet device coupled to Luttinger\nliquids rather than to Fermi liquids (Feldman et al., 2005;\nKomnik and Gogolin, 2003).\n\n2. Hamiltonian quantum ratchet for cold atoms\n\nMuch to one's surprise, systems governed by strictly\nHamiltonian dynamics are able to yield directed transport, as well. Directed transport may then take place\neven though no dissipation mechanisms are present.\nTrivial such examples are provided by integrable regular dynamics subjected to unbiased ac-drives with fixed\ninitial phase, i.e., not to be averaged over (Goychuk and\nH\u00e4nggi, 2001; Yevtushenko et al., 2000). Much more intriguing are time-dependent driven Hamiltonian quantum Brownian motors exhibiting a nontrivial, mixed clas-\n\nsical phase space structure (Denisov and Flach, 2001;\nFlach et al., 2000; Schanz et al., 2005, 2001). In these\nsystems, the onset of a directed flow requires, apart from\nthe necessity of breaking time reversal symmetry, also an\nadditional dynamical symmetry breaking. As it turns\nout, in the semi-classical limit, the corresponding directed flow then obeys a remarkable sum rule: Directed\ncurrents occurring in regular regimes of the underlying\nphase space dynamics are counter-balanced by directed\nflows occurring in chaotic regimes in phase space (Schanz\net al., 2005, 2001). As a result, if those individual directed currents are summed up over all disjoint regimes\nin (semi)-classical mixed phase space, no net transport\nemerges.\nThe concept of Hamiltonian quantum Brownian motors extends as well to fully quantum systems governed\nby a unitary time-evolution (Denisov et al., 2006, 2007;\nGong et al., 2007; Goychuk and H\u00e4nggi, 2000, 2001;\nSchanz et al., 2005, 2001). In fact, the issue of pure quantum coherence in the directed transport of chaotic Hamiltonian systems is presently a topic of active research.\nThis in particular holds true for cold atoms loaded in\noptical lattices: If properly detuned, the intrinsic quantum dynamics is then practically dissipation-free, thus\nproviding a paradigm for Hamiltonian quantum ratchet\ntransport. Various experimental cold atom ratchets have\nbeen realized (Sec. IV). Relevant to the topic of this\nsection is also the demonstration of sawtooth-like, asymmetric cold atom potentials by Salger et al. (2007). All\nthese systems are currently being employed to effectively\nshuttle cold matter on a quantum scale.\nIn the context of quantum ratchets for cold atoms one\nmust distinguish the common case of \"rectification of velocity\", implying that the mean position of particles is\ngrowing linearly in time, from the case with a \"rectification of force\", i.e. with mean momentum growing linearly\nin time. The latter class is better classified as \"quantum\nratchet accelerators\" (Gong and Brumer, 2004, 2006). In\nthe context of cold atom ratchets the first situation is obtained by rocking a cold atom gas with temporally asymmetric driving forces or temporally asymmetrically flashing, in combination with spatially asymmetric potential\nkicks (Denisov et al., 2007). The accelerator case originates from the physics of quantum \u03b4-kicked cold atoms\ndisplaying quantum chaos features such as the quantum\nsuppression of classical chaotic diffusion (dynamical localization) and the diametrically opposite phenomenon\nof quantum resonance (occurring when the kicking period\nis commensurate with the inverse recoil frequency). Under quantum resonance condition a linear (quadratic) increase of momentum (kinetic energy) takes place. These\nratchet acceleration features, theoretically predicted in\nsuitably modified kicked rotor models (Kenfack et al.,\n2008; Lundh and Wallin, 2005; Poletti et al., 2007b), requires tuning to exact resonance. In contrast, the accelerator models obtained from either a generalization of\na quantum kicked rotor or a generalization of a kicked\nHarper model (Gong and Brumer, 2004, 2006; Wang and\n\n\f45\nGong, 2008) are generic \"rectifiers of force\" in the sense\nthat here no need for tuning to exact resonance is necessary. Interestingly, these fully quantum ratchet accelerators display unbounded linear growth of mean momentum, while the underlying classical dynamics is fully\nchaotic, a situation where classical quantum Brownian\nmotor transport necessarily vanishes according to the\nabove mentioned classical sum rule (Schanz et al., 2005,\n2001). Thus, within this full quantum regime, which carries no clear relationship with the dynamics in the semiclassical regime, the quantum accelerator work by Gong\nand Brumer (2006), see also (Wang and Gong, 2008),\npresents an intriguing and generic quantum mechanical\nexception to the classical sum rule.\nEarly quantum resonance experiments in quantum\nratchet have already been successfully carried out: For\na \u03b4-kicked rotor model with time-symmetry broken by a\n2-period kicking cycle (asymmetric temporal drive), directed growth of momentum has been detected by Jones\net al. (2007). For a phase-dependent initial preparation of a Bose-Einstein condensate kicked at resonance,\na momentum acceleration has been observed by Sadgrove et al. (2007) at zero quasimomentum, while for an\narbitrary quasimomentum directed quantum Brownian\ntransport has been realized in Dana et al. (2008). The\nlatter experiment also evidenced that an intrinsic experimentally non-avoidable finite width in quasimomentum\ncauses a suppression of the acceleration eventually leading to a saturation effect after short times.\nThis field of Hamiltonian quantum ratchets is presently\nundergoing a racy development. For example, it is possible to apply control schemes to relative phases for resulting single-particle quantum Brownian motor currents\nby harvesting Landau-Zener transitions (Morales-Molina\net al., 2008). Of particular theoretical and experimental\ninterest is also the study of the role of nonlinearity on\nthe size of directed quantum currents in interacting cold\ngases, as described within mean field theory by a nonlinear quantum ratchet evolution of the Gross-Pitaevskiitype. There, the interplay of time-dependent driving\nand nonlinear Floquet states yields new features, such\nas lifting of accidental symmetries (Poletti et al., 2007a)\nand a resonant enhancement of directed ratchet currents\n(Morales-Molina and Flach, 2008).\n\nscenarios of the peristaltic type, or nanosystems which\nare driven by unbiased, but asymmetric mechanical or\nchemical causes that are tightly coupled to resulting motion.\n\nA. Pumping of charge, spin and heat\n\nA first class of physical systems that comes to mind\nin relation to the working principles of artificial Brownian motors are nanoscale pump devices. Pumping is\ncharacterized by the occurrence of a net flux of particles,\ncharges, spins and alike, in response to time dependent\nexternal manipulations of an otherwise unbiased system.\nThis mechanism is well studied and peristaltic pumps\nare being widely exploited in technological applications.\nThese systems do not require a periodic arrangement of\ncomponents nor is thermal Brownian motion an issue for\ntheir operation. In particular, adiabatic turnstiles and\npumps for charge and other degrees of freedom have attracted considerable interest both experimentally (Hohberger et al., 2001; Kouwenhoven et al., 1991; Pothier et al., 1992; Switkes et al., 1999) and theoretically\n(Aono, 2003; Brandes and Vorrath, 2002; Brouwer, 1998;\nMoskalets and B\u00fcttiker, 2004; Shutenko et al., 2000;\nSinitsyn and Nemenman, 2007; Spivak et al., 1995; Thouless, 1983; Vavilov et al., 2001; Zhou et al., 1999).\nRealizations of artificial pumps on the nanoscale often involve coupled quantum dots or superlattices. Most\nnotably, in such peristaltic devices the number of transferred charges, or more generally, the number of transporting units per cycle is directly linked to the cycle\nperiod. As a result the output current thus becomes\nproportional to the driving frequency. This observation\nleads to the conclusion that high frequency nonadiabatic\npumping might become more effective. Indeed, nonadiabatic pumping of charge, spin (Flatte, 2008; Scheid et al.,\n2007a; Smirnov et al., 2008) or also heat (Li et al., 2008)\ndoes exhibit a rich phenomenology, including resonances\n(Arrachea et al., 2007; Cota et al., 2005; Kohler et al.,\n2005; Moskalets and B\u00fcttiker, 2002; Platero and Aguado,\n2004; Rey et al., 2007; Stafford and Wingreen, 1996) and\nother potentially useful noise-induced features (Sanchez\net al., 2008; Strass et al., 2005); hence yielding a close\ninterrelation between nonadiabatic pumping in the presence of noise and the physics of Brownian motors.\n\nIX. SUNDRY TOPICS\n\nIn the following we discuss some classes of nanosystems\nand devices which feature directed transport in the spirit\nof Brownian motors. In these systems, however, rectification of Brownian motion does not constitute the main\nelement for directed transport. We recall that an artificial Brownian motor is mainly noise-controlled, meaning\nthat such a motor operates in a hardly predictable manner. In contrast, we discuss next systems that exhibit\ndirected transport predominantly as the result of strong\ncoupling schemes. Typical examples are adiabatic pump\n\nB. Synthetic molecular motors and machines\n\nAs already emphasized in our introduction, the field\nof Brownian motors has its roots in the study and applications of intracelluar transport in terms of molecular\nmotors (Astumian and H\u00e4nggi, 2002; J\u00fclicher et al., 1997;\nLipowsky and Klumpp, 2005; Reimann, 2002; Reimann\nand H\u00e4nggi, 2002; Wang and Oster, 2002). These molecular motors function in view of structure and motility\nby use of specialized proteins in living systems. These\n\n\f46\n\nFIG. 38 (Color online) Free energy landscape of a single\nazobenzene molecule along the reaction coordinate of the conformation coordinate given by the bond angle \u03a6N N C , which\nvaries from about \u221260\u25e6 to \u223c +60\u25e6 . Transitions can be induced optically (\u03bb1 \u223c 420 nm for the short cis-form (0.6 nm)\nand \u03bb2 \u223c 365 nm for the extended trans-form (0.9 nm), respectively) from the singlet ground state S0 into the excited\nsinglet state S1 , from which the molecule subsequently relaxes\nfluctuation-driven into either the cis-form or the trans-form.\nNotably, the trans-form is thermally favored. The insets depict the corresponding conformations with the transition state\nlocated near \u03a6N N C \u223c 0\u25e6 . Figure provided by Thorsten Hugel\nfrom TU-Munich, Germany\n\nbiological motor enzymes are fueled by ATP hydrolysis\nand are able to efficiently perform mechanical work on\nthe nanoscale inside biological cell structures (Howard,\n2001; Schliwa, 2002).\nClosely related to synthetic motors are the intriguing possibilities of devising DNA-fueled artificial motors:\nseveral settings render possible to biologically engineer\nnanomachines which move along a priori designed tracks\n(Turberfield et al., 2003; Yin et al., 2004; Yorke et al.,\n2000).\nAn offspring of this topic is the engineering of nanomachines based on interlocked molecular species. This has\nspurred a flurry of new investigations within the physical\nbiology and the organic and physical chemistry community, aimed at building bottom-up synthetic molecular\nsystems which carry out such diverse functions as molecular switches, molecular rotors and any other kind of\nmolecular gears.\nA beautiful example of this class of molecular motor is the light powered molecular machine developed by\nHugel et al. (2002). Bistable photosensitive azobenzene\nmolecules can be synthesized into long chains, each containing molecules in either their trans- or cis-form. The\nfree energy landscape corresponding to different molecule\nconformational states is sketched in Fig. 38 versus the\nreaction coordinate. Polymeric chains have the advantage of scaling up the length changes corresponding to\nthe two different conformations of its constituents. The\nlength changes of an azobenzene polymeric chains can\nthen be transformed into mechanical energy by means of\nthe lever arm of a atom force microscope (AFM) which,\nin combination with the light sources, forms the core of\nthe light driven molecular motor of Fig. 39.\n\nSuch a molecular motor can be operated very much\naccording to an idealized thermodynamic cycle of the\nStirling type: Individual azobenzene polymers are made\nstretch and contract by inducing optical trans-cis transitions of their constituents. This machine thus demonstrates opto-mechanical energy conversion in a singlemolecule motor device. The analogy with a thermodynamic cycle should though not be taken too seriously. A\nthermal Stirling engine operates between baths of differing temperature; here, the \"expansion\" and \"compression\" of the molecular motor are performed at a fixed\ntemperature and, most notably, by means of nonequilibrium light sources. This laser operated molecular motor\ncan as well be used as a building block to devise a bioinspired molecular locomotive which can be guided forth\nand back on a preassigned track via a laser assisted protocol (Wang, 2004).\nIn the operation of these synthetic nanoscale devices,\nespecially when powered by light or chemical reactive additives, thermal noise does not necessarily play a major\nrole, i.e. the function of these synthetic molecular motors is ruled predominantly by deterministic forces, forces\nthat depend on the mechanical and chemical properties\nof the molecules (Neuert et al., 2006). Yet, this area of research is fascinating and we therefore encourage the interested reader to read some recent items and tutorials (Astumian, 2007; Balzani et al., 2006; Browne and Feringa,\n2006; Porto et al., 2000) and to consult the timely and\nmost comprehensive reviews by Kottas et al. (2005) and\nKay et al. (2007) for more details.\n\nX. CONCLUDING REMARKS\n\nWith this review we have taken the reader on a tour of\nhorizon through the many intriguing and multi-facetted\napplications that Brownian motion can offer in the most\ndiverse areas of nanotechnology, when combined with\nspatio-temporal symmetry breaking, nonlinearity and,\npossibly, collective interaction effects.\nThe physics of classical and quantum Brownian motion is by now well established, also in consideration of\nthe breadth of the theoretical modeling and experimental realizations produced over the last century. Many\nresearch activities are still spawning in interdisciplinary\nfields encompassing chemistry, biological research, information sciences and even are extending into social sciences and economics. The main lesson to be learned from\nRobert Brown's and Albert Einstein's work is therefore:\nRather than fighting thermal motion, we should put it\nto work to our advantage. Brownian motors thrive from\nthese ceaseless noise source to efficiently direct, separate,\npump and shuttle degrees of freedom of differing nature\nreliably and effectively.\nIn writing this overview we spared no efforts in covering\na wide range of interesting developments and potential\nachievements. In doing so we nevertheless had to make\nsome selective choices of topics and applications, which\n\n\f47\n\nFIG. 39 (Color online) Operation of a light powered molecular motor: The panel on the left depicts the schematic force\nextension cycle for the opto-mechanical energy conversion cycle of a single poly-azobenzene. In analogy to a thermodynamic\nStirling-cycle, the polymer is first stretched by the AFM-tip acting as the piston (I \u2212\u2192 II). Then, the application of the first\noptical excitation with \u03bb2 ' 365nm shortens the polymer by inducing a (poly)trans- (poly)cis transition. This yields a first\npart of work (blue area) in bending the AFM cantilever, which is clearly not as stiff as a piston in a common Stirling motor.\nIn analogy to the Stirling cycle, another amount of work is done during the relaxation of the polymer (III \u2212\u2192 IV). Finally, a\nsecond optical excitation with \u03bb1 ' 420nm is needed to reset the molecule into its starting (poly)trans-state (IV \u2212\u2192 I). The\ntotal work output of the system is the mechanical energy corresponding to the contraction (\u2206L = N \u2206l) of the entire polymer\nchain of N azobenzenes against the external load. The experimental realization of a full single molecule operating cycle (Hugel\net al., 2002) is depicted in the panel on the right. Figure provided by Thorsten Hugel from TU-Munich, Germany\n\nto some extent reflect the authors' preferences and prejudices. Closely related topics of ongoing research were\nnot reviewed for space limits. For example, in Sec. IX.B\nwe did not cover in sufficient detail the fascinating topic\nof ATP-driven molecular motors and DNA-fueled motors, for which we refer to earlier comprehensive reviews\nand books, like in J\u00fclicher et al. (1997), Howard (2001),\nSchliwa (2002), and Lipowsky and Klumpp (2005). This\nsurely is the case of the bottom-up design and operation\nof synthetic Brownian molecular devices, extensively covered by the excellent review of Kay et al. (2007). Another\nsuch topic is the question of the so-called absolute negative mobility, which occurs via quantum tunneling events\nin quantum systems (Aguado and Platero, 1997; Grifoni\nand H\u00e4nggi, 1998; Keay et al., 1995; Platero and Aguado,\n2004) and through mere nonequilibrium driven diffusive\ndynamics in classical systems (Eichhorn et al., 2002a,b;\nKostur et al., 2008; Machura et al., 2007a; Ros et al.,\n2005).\nOur main focus was on noise-assisted directional transport, shuttling and pumping of individual or collective\nparticle-, charge- or matter-degrees of freedom. The concept, however, extends as well to the transport of other\ndegrees of freedom such as energy (heat) and spin modes\n(see also in Sec.(IX.A). Both topics are experiencing a\nsurge of interest with new exciting achievements being\nreported in the current literature. The concept carries\npotential for yet other applications. Examples that come\nto mind are the noise-assisted directional transport and\ntransfer of informational degrees of freedom such as probability or entropy and, within a quantum context, the\nshuttling of entanglement information. These issues immediately relate to the energetics of artificial Brownian\nmotors reviewed in Sec. (II.E), including measures of\nopen and closed loop control scenarios and other opti-\n\nmization schemes.\nWe have attempted to catch the potential of Brownian\nmotors in nowadays nanotechnology by putting them to\nwork; we discussed how such motors can be constructed\nand characterized, and how directional, Brownian motion driven transport can be controlled, measured, and\noptimized. Moreover, we are confident that the interdisciplinary style of this overview shall encourage the readers to bring in new approaches and motivations in this\nchallenging and fast growing research area.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThis review would not have emerged without continuous support from and insightful discussions with our close\ncollaborators and colleagues.
