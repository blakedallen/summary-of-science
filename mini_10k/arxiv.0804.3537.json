Lorentz and\nCPT invariances have supreme importance in the elaboration of modern Quantum Field Theory models.\nHowever, in the last decade the possibility of violation of these symmetries has been vastly investigated\n[1]-[41]. A standard model description, where possible violations of such invariances are considered, was\ndeveloped by Colladay and Kosteleck\u00fd [4], [6] and by Coleman and Glashow [5], [8]. One of the most\ndiscussed terms that incorporates these features has the Chern-Simons (CS) form\nZ\n1\n\u03a3CS = \u2212\nd4 x c\u03bc A\u03bd F\u03b1\u03b2 \u01eb\u03bc\u03bd\u03b1\u03b2 ,\n(1)\n4\nin which c\u03bc is a constant four-vector that selects a space-time direction. Therefore, it gives rise to an\noptical activity of the vacuum. Although astrophysical results put very stringent limits on the magnitude\nof c\u03bc [1], [3], many controversies have emerged from the discussion whether such term could be generated\nby means of radiative corrections from the fermionic sector with the inclusion of the CPT and Lorentz\nviolating axial term, b\u03bc \u03c8\u0304\u03b3 \u03bc \u03b3 5 \u03c8, b\u03bc being a constant background vector. The main point concerns the regularization dependence of this term. As discussed in many of these papers, the finite radiative correction\n\u2206c\u03bc comes from the cancellation of divergences and, therefore, is in principle regularization dependent.\nSymmetries are invoked to argue against or in favor of the generation of such a term.\nOther discussions focus on the possibility of considering a source for the b\u03bc field and in stating gauge\ninvariance in a weak way, which means gauge invariance of the action and not necessarily of the Lagrangian\ndensity.\nIn this paper, we reassess the discussion on the radiative generation of the CS-like term. We give\nparticular attention to the the possibility of gauge symmetry violation coming from quantum corrections.\nWe also analyze if gauge invariance can impose some constraint on the coefficient of the CS-like term.\n\n\u2217 scarp1@des.cefetmg.br\n\u2020 msampaio@fisica.ufmg.br\n\u2021 carolina@fisica.ufmg.br\n\u00a7 brigitte@teor.fis.uc.pt\n\n\f2\nThe paper is divided as follows: in section II, the massless model is considered. It is shown at one-loop\norder that the even parity piece of the polarization tensor has the structure of simple spinorial QED,\non arguments of assigning the constant background field to arbitrary rooting of the internal momentum\ndependence. The implicit regularization (IR) technique allows to pin down the exact form of surface\nterms and its a priori arbitrary parameterized values. A weak constraint, i.e. a relation among two\nof the parameters, instead of fixing both values independently, is seen to be sufficient to ensure gauge\ninvariance. The odd parity term is shown not to deliver further constraints on this relation, which leads\nfinally to the indeterminacy of the coefficient of the CS term. This result is compared to the chirally\nrotated theory and the Jacobian of the transformation. In section III, we carry out the analysis of the\nmassive model, expanding the exact propagator to second order in the constant background field. Again,\na careful study of the surface terms with the IR method leaves the CS-like term coefficient undetermined.\nWe summarize our results in section IV.\nII.\n\nTHE MASSLESS MODEL\n\nConcerning the modified QED which includes the axial term in the fermionic sector, some papers were\ndevoted to discuss the gauge invariance of the model [17], [18], [20], [21]. In ref. [17], B. Altschul has\nanalyzed the massless model and argued that gauge symmetry is violated at b2 order of the vacuum\npolarization tensor. In a further work [18], the author has shown that an adequate Pauli-Villars regulator\nis compatible with the gauge invariance of the model.\nWe would like to show here that the gauge invariance of the action enforces a certain relation among the\na priori arbitrary coefficients which parameterize surface terms. This can be achieved by considering the\nwhole amplitude. Nevertheless, this is not sufficient to fix unambiguously the coefficient of the radiatively\ngenerated CS term.\nWe begin our reasoning by analyzing the massless case, for which the fermion action is given by\nZ\n\u03a3\u03c8 = d4 x \u03c8\u0304(i\u2202/ \u2212 eA\n/ \u2212 /b\u03b35 )\u03c8.\n(2)\nIt is instructive to discuss first a non-perturbative calculation (in b and in the coupling constant) of the\ninduced CS-type term. This calculation has been performed by J.-M. Chung in [22]. By making the\nchiral transformation,\n\u03c8 \u2192 e\u2212i\u03b35 b*x \u03c8 , \u03c8\u0304 \u2192 \u03c8\u0304e\u2212i\u03b35 b*x ,\n\n(3)\n\nwe can eliminate the b\u03bc vector from the classical action. Nevertheless, at the quantum level, the measure\nof the generating functional acquires a factor given by the Jacobian [43],\n\u001a Z\n\u001b\nJ[b\u03bc , A\u03bc ] = exp \u2212i d4 x (b * x)A[A\u03bc ](x) ,\n(4)\nwith\nA[A\u03bc ](x) =\n\n1 \u03bc\u03bd\u03b1\u03b2\n\u01eb\nF\u03bc\u03bd F\u03b1\u03b2 .\n16\u03c0 2\n\n(5)\n\nWe can write\nJ[b\u03bc , A\u03bc ] =\n\u001b\n\u001a Z\n1\n\u03bc\u03bd\u03b1\u03b2\n4\n(b * x)\u01eb\n\u2202\u03bc A\u03bd \u2202\u03b1 A\u03b2 ,\nexp \u2212i d x\n4\u03c0 2\nwhich after an integration by parts turns out to be\n\u001a Z\n\u001b\n1\n\u03bc\u03bd\u03b1\u03b2\nJ[b\u03bc , A\u03bc ] = exp i d4 x\nb\n\u01eb\nA\n\u2202\nA\n\u03bc\n\u03bd \u03b1 \u03b2 .\n4\u03c0 2\n\n(6)\n\n(7)\n\n\f3\nWe see that after the chiral transformation the axial term disappears from the fermionic sector. As\na result the QED Lagrangian is obtained, together with a Jacobian which is taken into account when\nquantum corrections are calculated. Therefore the non-massive model with Lorentz and CPT violation in\nthe fermionic sector is equivalent to the non-massive QED, if a CS-type term coming from the Jacobian\nis added to the radiative correction of the photon self-energy. As a consequence, since the latter model is\ngauge invariant, so must be the original one. We will comment at the end of this section on the coefficient\nof the CS term.\nWe now carry out an one-loop analysis for the massless case, following ref. [17]. If the fermion is\nnon-massive, its propagator can be decomposed as\ni\ni\ni\n=\nPL +\nPR ,\nk/ \u2212 /b\u03b35\nk/ \u2212 /b\nk/ + /b\n\n(8)\n\nwhere we are using the chiral projectors\nPR,L =\n\n1 \u00b1 \u03b35\n.\n2\n\n(9)\n\nIt is now simple to analyze the full vacuum polarization tensor and achieve some conclusions with respect\nto the gauge invariance of the theory and the generation of the CS term.

Any regularization scheme that respects gauge invariance will return an answer\nwhich is transverse and depends only on p = k2 \u2212 k1 . In ref. [24], this amplitude has been calculated by\nmeans of Implicit Regularization [42] with arbitrary k1 and k2 . In the massless limit, it gives\n2\n\u03bc \u03bd\n2 \u03bc\u03bd\n\u03a0\u03bc\u03bd\n\u00b1 = \u03a0(p )(p p \u2212 p g )\n\n\u22124 \u03b11 g \u03bc\u03bd \u2212 (k12 + k22 )\u03b12 g \u03bc\u03bd\n1\n+ (k1\u03b1 k1\u03b2 + k2\u03b1 k2\u03b2 + k1\u03b1 k2\u03b2 )\u03b13 g {\u03bc\u03bd\u03b1\u03b2}\n3\n\u2212(k1 + k2 )\u03bc (k1 + k2 )\u03bd \u03b12 ) .\n\n(13)\n\nIn the equation above, \u03a0(p2 ) includes the divergent part.

For the traditional spinorial QED, gauge\ninvariance is obtained by setting these surface terms to zero. Pauli-Villars Regularization, for example, is\nconstructed to warrant gauge invariance, and in this case the surface terms cancel out. The diagrammatic\nproof of gauge invariance [44] is based on the assumption that there exists a regularization which allows\nfor shifts in the integration momenta. Dimensional Regularization has been developed exactly with this\ncharacteristic. So, if some technique works in the proper dimension of the theory, the preservation of\nthe Ward identities depends on the elimination of the surface terms by means of symmetry restoring\ncounterterms. The exception takes place when anomalies are involved. For situations like that, it is not\npossible to eliminate all the surface terms.\nNow let us return to equation (13) and see how the result of [17] can be obtained. We turn our attention\nto the second order contribution in the external vector b\u03bc . We have\n\u0001\n1 \u03bc\u03bd\n\u03a0\n+ \u03a0\u03bc\u03bd\nbb+\n2 bb\u2212\n\u0001\n\b\n= \u22124 b2 g \u03bc\u03bd + 2b\u03bc b\u03bd (\u03b13 \u2212 2\u03b12 ) .\n\n(18)\n\nIf one uses symmetric integration when calculating \u03b12 and \u03b13 , such that k \u03bc k \u03bd \u2192 g \u03bc\u03bd k 2 /4 and\nk \u03bc k \u03bd k \u03b1 k \u03b2 \u2192 g {\u03bc\u03bd\u03b1\u03b2} k 4 /24, one obtains\n\u03b12 =\n\ni\n32\u03c0 2\n\nand\n\n\u03b13 =\n\n5i\n,\n96\u03c0 2\n\n(19)\n\nso that\n\u0001\n\u0001\ni\n1 \u03bc\u03bd\n\u03a0bb\u2212 + \u03a0\u03bc\u03bd\nb2 g \u03bc\u03bd + 2b\u03bc b\u03bd .\nbb+ =\n2\n2\n24\u03c0\n\n(20)\n\nIt is the same result of [17] apart from some factors of i and e in the definition of the Feynman rules. It\nis also interesting to see how the b\u03bc independent part of the photon self energy (the simple QED vacuum\npolarization tensor) depend on the surface terms. From (13), we have\n2\n\u03bc \u03bd\n2 \u03bc\u03bd\n\u03bc\u03bd\n\u03a0\u03bc\u03bd\n0 = \u03a0(p )(p p \u2212 p g ) \u2212 4\u03b11 g\n4\b\n\u2212 \u03b12 (p\u03bc p\u03bd \u2212 p2 g \u03bc\u03bd )\n3\n+(2p\u03bc p\u03bd + p2 g \u03bc\u03bd )(\u03b13 \u2212 2\u03b12 ) .\n\n(21)\n\nBy examining the expression above, we conclude that if gauge invariance is broken by the \u03a0\u03bc\u03bd\nbb\u00b1 term, so\nit is also broken in the zeroth order, which is the QED vacuum polarization tensor. A simple calculation\n\n\f5\nshows that any of the two possibilities for gauge invariance in the zeroth and second order in b\u03bc photon\nself-energy, the stronger one, \u03b1\u2032 s = 0, or the weaker, \u03b11 = 0 and \u03b13 = 2\u03b12 , set to zero the first order\ndependence of \u03a0\u03bc\u03bd\n\u00b1 on b\u03bc .\nHence, gauge invariance must be preserved in the full amplitude. Note that this implies the complete\ndisappearance of b\u03bc from \u03a0\u03bc\u03bd\n\u00b1 . This means that the shifts k \u2192 k \u00b1 b must be allowed independently in\nthe two contributions, not necessarily being a global shift.\nHowever, even by enforcing gauge invariance, we still have the freedom of choice of the parameter \u03b12 .\nNow, we have not considered yet the \u03a0\u03bc\u03bd\n5\u00b1 parts. The two contributions are equal and we have\n\u0001\n1 \u03bc\u03bd\n\u03bc\u03bd\n\u03a05+ + \u03a0\u03bc\u03bd\n5\u2212 = \u03a05+ ,\n2\n\n\u03a0\u03bc\u03bd\n5 =\n\n(22)\n\nwhich, after Dirac algebra can be written as\n\u03bc\u03b1\u03bd\u03b2\n\u03a0\u03bc\u03bd\n5 = \u22124ib\u03b2 \u01eb\n\n= \u22124ib\u03b2 \u01eb\n\n\u03bc\u03b1\u03bd\u03b2\n\nZ\n\n\u039b\nk\n\n(p + k)\u03b1\n(k + b)2 (k + p + b)2\n\n(p\u03b1 I + I\u03b1 ),\n\n(23)\n\nwith\nI, I\u03b1 =\n\nZ\n\n\u039b\n\nk\n\n1, k\u03b1\n.\n(k + b)2 (k + p + b)2\n\nThe results of these integrals by means of Implicit Regularization [42] are given by\n\u0014 \u0012 2\u0013\n\u0015\np\ni\nln\n\u2212\n\u2212\n2\nI = Ilog (\u03bb2 ) \u2212\n16\u03c0 2\n\u03bb2\n\n(24)\n\n(25)\n\nand\n(p + 2b)\u03b1 \b\nIlog (\u03bb2 )\n2\n\u001b\n\u0014 \u0012 2\u0013\n\u0015\np\ni\nln\n\u2212\n\u2212\n2\n\u2212\n\u03b1\n\u2212\n2 ,\n16\u03c0 2\n\u03bb2\n\nI\u03b1 = \u2212\n\n(26)\n\nwhere\n2\n\nIlog (\u03bb ) =\n\nZ\n\n\u039b\n\nk\n\n1\n(k 2 \u2212 \u03bb2 )2\n\n(27)\n\nis the remaining regularization dependent part and \u03bb2 is a mass parameter characteristic of the procedure.\nSubstituting these results in equation (23), we get\n\u03bc\u03bd\u03b1\u03b2\n\u03a0\u03bc\u03bd\n\u21d2 \u2206c\u03bc = 2i\u03b12 b\u03bc .\n5 = \u22124i\u03b12 p\u03b1 b\u03b2 \u01eb\n\n(28)\n\nWe see that the coefficient of the CS-type generated term is proportional to the surface term \u03b12 . It is the\nsame parameter that could not be fixed on gauge invariance grounds. Of course, symmetric integration\nwill give us the traditional result\n\u2206c\u03bc = \u2212\n\n1\nb\u03bc .\n16\u03c0 2\n\n(29)\n\nNevertheless, we would like to argue that this result is ambiguous and regularization dependent. If we\ndecide to calculate all the surface terms by using symmetric integration, gauge invariance is violated even\nin the zeroth order in b (from eq. (13), transversality is violated in all orders in b if symmetric integration\nis applied to calculate the surface terms). This means violation of gauge symmetry in the simple QED.\nMoreover, the non-perturbative functional calculus has shown us that the model must be gauge invariant.\n\n\f6\nConcerning the coefficient which was obtained in the functional calculation, as discussed in [22] and [13],\nthere is an unavoidable ambiguity coming from the definition of the current operator.\nOne comment on the meaning of Implicit Regularization is in order. Although the regulator needs not\nto be specified, it serves to obtain the following crucial features of IR: all infinities and the differences of\ninfinite integrals of the same degree of divergency (the surface terms) occurring in a certain amplitude do\nnot involve loop propagators that depend on external momenta. Thus they decouple from the physical\ncontent and dynamics of the amplitude. The latter is contained in strictly finite integrals, which are\nintegrated without restriction. As a consequence the regulator does not need to be a gauge invariant\none (an example is the simple cutoff), since the symmetry is restored by fixing the surface terms (it\ncorresponds to make use of symmetry restoring counterterms). Nevertheless the regulator should not\nmodify the dimension of the integrals, or one would face the problems related to the dimension specific\ntheories. Keeping in mind that a regularization is implicit, all the integrals of the same amplitude are\ntreated on the same footing. In other words, the same unregularized integrals will give us the same result\nwhen regularized. The \u03b1i 's (see eq. (13)) coming from them are the same and are adjusted according\nwith the symmetry. On the other hand, since the adjustment of the \u03b1i 's corresponds to using symmetry\nrestoring counterterms, for different amplitudes they can be fixed at different values. It is in this sense\nthat we can say that the same unregularized integrals can lead to different results, i.e. when they stem\nfrom different amplitudes. This is not the case here. We are treating only one amplitude, the vacuum\npolarization tensor of the model.\nIII.\n\nTHE MASSIVE MODEL\n\nIn this section, we complement our analysis with the massive model. It is instructive to see that the\nsame conditions for preserving gauge symmetry are obtained. First, we consider the complete photon\nself-energy, \u03a0\u03bc\u03bd (p), which on gauge invariance grounds must be transverse:\np\u03bc \u03a0\u03bc\u03bd = 0.\n\n(30)\n\nThe modified fermionic propagator is given by\nS(k) =\n\ni\n,\nk/ \u2212 m \u2212 /b\u03b35\n\n(31)\n\nand so, we have\n\u03a0\u03bc\u03bd =\nZ \u039b \u001a\ntr \u03b3 \u03bd\n\u2212\nk\n\n1\n1\n\u03b3\u03bc\nk/ + p\n/ \u2212 m \u2212 /b\u03b35 k/ \u2212 m \u2212 /b\u03b35\n\n\u001b\n\n.\n(32)\n\nNow we perform the contraction with the external momentum p and use the identity /p = (k/ + /p \u2212 m \u2212\n/b\u03b35 ) \u2212 (k/ \u2212 m \u2212 /b\u03b35 ) and trace properties to obtain\n\u001b\nZ \u039b \u001a\n1\n\u03b3\u03bd\np\u03bc \u03a0\u03bc\u03bd =\ntr\nk/ \u2212 m \u2212 /b\u03b35\nk\n\u001b\nZ \u039b \u001a\n1\n\u03bd\n\u2212\ntr\n(33)\n\u03b3 .\nk/ + p\n/ \u2212 m \u2212 /b\u03b35\nk\nAnd then it is clear from the equation above that gauge invariance is obeyed under the condition that\nthe shift k \u2192 k + p in the first integral is allowed (or k \u2192 k \u2212 p in the second one). Note that the shift\nis not carried out in the amplitude as a whole, but only in one of the terms. In other words, it is not a\nglobal shift. The same occurs if we are dealing with the traditional QED (b = 0). Nevertheless, the shift\nis carried out in the contracted amplitude p\u03bc \u03a0\u03bc\u03bd and this will be important for the conclusions on the\ngeneration of the CS term.\n\n\f7\nNow, we consider the possibilities of violation of gauge symmetry, specifically the quadratic in b contribution to the vacuum polarization tensor. For the modified fermion propagator, it is possible to write\nan expansion, which reads\n\u001a\n\u001bn\n\u221e\nX\ni\ni\ni\n\u2212ib\n/\u03b35\n=\nk/ \u2212 m \u2212 /b\u03b35\nk/ \u2212 m\nk/ \u2212 m\nn=0\n=\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nSn (k).\n\n(34)\n\nn=0\n\nFor the b2 order, we have\n\u03a0\u03bc\u03bd\nbb = \u2212\n\u2212\n\nZ\n\n\u039b\n\nZ\n\n\u039b\n\nZ\n\n\u039b\n\ntr {\u03b3 \u03bd S1 (p + k)\u03b3 \u03bc S1 (k)}\n\nk\n\ntr {\u03b3 \u03bd S2 (p + k)\u03b3 \u03bc S0 (k)}\n\nk\n\n\u2212\n\ntr {\u03b3 \u03bd S0 (p + k)\u03b3 \u03bc S2 (k)} .\n\n(35)\n\nk\n\nWhen the contraction with p\u03bc is performed and the identity p\n/ = (k/ + p\n/ \u2212 m) \u2212 (k/ \u2212 m) is used, there\nremains only two terms:\np\u03bc \u03a0\u03bc\u03bd\nbb =\nZ \u039b \u001a\n\u2212\ntr \u03b3 \u03bd\n\n1\n1\n1\n/b\u03b35\n/b\u03b35\nk/ + p\n/\u2212m\nk/ + p\n/\u2212m\nk/ + p\n/\u2212m\nk\n\u001b\nZ \u039b \u001a\n1\n1\n1\n.\n/b\u03b35\n/b\u03b35\n+\ntr \u03b3 \u03bd\nk\n/\n\u2212\nm\nk\n/\n\u2212\nm\nk\n/\n\u2212\nm\nk\n\n\u001b\n(36)\n\nThe second term is null and the first differs from it by a surface term (they differ by a shift). So, all we\nhave to do is to identify the surface terms. They are easily identified by using, after the Dirac algebra\nhas been performed, the identity,\n1\n1\n= 2\n(p + k)2 \u2212 m2\n(k \u2212 m2 )\np2 + 2p * k\n\u2212 2\n,\n(k \u2212 m2 ) [(p + k)2 \u2212 m2 ]\n\n(37)\n\nto separate the divergent (regularization dependent) terms. The surface terms come from differences\nbetween integrals of the same degree of divergence. Using the definitions of equations (15) and (16), we\nget\n\u0003\n\u0002 2 \u03bd\n\u03bd\n,\n(38)\np\u03bc \u03a0\u03bc\u03bd\nbb = \u22124(\u03b13 \u2212 2\u03b12 ) b p + 2(b * p)b\n\nand the same condition for transversality is achieved.\nTo complete our analysis, we look at the linear contribution in the external vector b\u03bc . We have two\ncontributions:\nZ \u039b\ntr {\u03b3 \u03bd S0 (p + k)\u03b3 \u03bc S1 (k)}\n\u03a0\u03bc\u03bd\n=\nb\nk\n\n+\n\nZ\n\n\u039b\n\ntr {\u03b3 \u03bd S1 (p + k)\u03b3 \u03bc S0 (k)} .\n\n(39)\n\nk\n\nUsing that\nS1 (k) = \u2212iS0 (k)b\n/\u03b35 S0 (k),\n\n(40)\n\n\f8\nwe obtain\n\u03a0\u03bc\u03bd\nb = \u2212i\n\u2212i\n\nZ\n\n\u039b\n\nZ\n\ntr {\u03b3 \u03bd S0 (p + k)\u03b3 \u03bc S0 (k)b\n/\u03b35 S0 (k)}\n\nk\n\n\u039b\n\ntr {\u03b3 \u03bd S0 (k + p)b\n/\u03b35 S0 (k + p)\u03b3 \u03bc S0 (k)} .\n\n(41)\n\nk\n\nWe have already seen on gauge invariance grounds that a shift k \u2192 k \u00b1 p must be allowed in p\u03bc \u03a0\u03bc\u03bd ,\nnot necessarily as a global shift. However, in this contracted amplitude the linear term in b has already\ndisappeared. The reason is the presence of the antisymmetric Levi-C\u0131\u0300vita tensor. So it does not say\nanything about the surface term that emerges from a shift k \u2192 k \u2212 p in the first integral. By performing\nthis shift and using the fact that the integral is odd in p and its antisymmetry under the exchange \u03bc \u2194 \u03bd,\nwe see that we have two equal terms plus the surface term. This surface term is easily identified.

For the others a regularization method is needed. Since we are going\nto analyze the regularization dependence of the generated term, we opt to maintain the regularization\nimplicit. So, we adopt here the procedure of Implicit Regularization (IR) [24],[25], [42], since it permits\nto let the evaluation of divergent integrals to the end of the calculation.

We can make explicit the regularization required to manipulate the\ndivergent integrals. Then, renormalization allows to remove the regulator in all the finite integrals and\none is left with the integrals which depend on the regularization, specifically the basic divergence Ilog (m2 )\nand the surface term parameterized as \u03b12 g\u03bc\u03b2 . We see that I\u03b2 and J\u03bc\u03b2 do depend on the regularization\nto be used. Nevertheless, these ambiguous terms cancel out exactly when the integrals are inserted into\nthe amplitude. Actually, the real ambiguity in all this calculation comes from the shift carried out in one\nof the terms of eq. (41) in order to obtain the expression (42).\nThe result of the massless model can be recovered if the limit m2 \u2192 0 is taken before the other one,\np2 \u2192 0. As before, gauge symmetry must be preserved, but it is not sufficient to fix \u03b12 . The interesting\nresult is that although the shift k \u2192 k \u00b1 p must be allowed in p\u03bc \u03a0\u03bc\u03bd , this does not mean that all the\nsurface terms must be set to zero. Actually, they are constrained to respect a definite relation. Even in\ntheories in which there are no parity violating mathematical objects, like the \u03b35 matrix, this freedom of\nfixing one of the surface terms occurs. However, in these cases there is no loss of generality if they are\nput to zero.\nIV.\n\nSUMMARY AND DISCUSSION\n\nWe have carried out an investigation of the modified Lorentz violating QED with an axial term in the\nfermionic sector. Particular attention was paid in the preservation or violation of gauge symmetry of\nthe model and its relation with the radiative generation of a Chern-Simons-like term. If we consider the\naction, we have shown that the quantum corrections must preserve gauge symmetry. If it is broken, then\ngauge invariance of the simple QED is also spoiled. In order to come to this conclusion, the study of the\nmassless model is very instructive, since in this case the functional non-perturbative analysis (in b and\nin the coupling constant), performed in the beginning of section 2, exhibits clearly this feature. When\n\n\f10\nloop calculations are performed, the surface terms play an important role as parameters to be fixed.\nGauge invariance, in this case, requires the possibility of carrying out some shifts. This fact does not\nrestrict all the surface terms to be fixed null, although they are constrained to obey a certain relation.\nAs a conclusion, there is an unavoidable ambiguity in the calculation of the coefficient of the radiatively\ngenerated Chern-Simons-like term.\nHowever it has not been the main purpose of the present work to show that gauge invariance does not\nfix the coefficient of the Chern-Simons like term. This is only a residual conclusion.\nIt is obvious that the gauge invariance of the action is not violated by the CS term, whatever its\ncoefficient might be. Our main focus is the quadratic term in b, the background that causes Lorentz\nviolation. Despite the existence of a vast bibliography concerning the radiative generation of the ChernSimons (CS) type term, only few publications treat the quadratic piece. Parity arguments have been\nconsidered by Altschul [17] to admit the possibility of violation of gauge invariance by the quadratic\nterm and the respective calculation in a specific scheme led indeed to its violation. In further works\n[18], [19], this result is used to perform other analysis. In ref. [21], the authors have performed the\ncalculation of the quadratic term in b using a Pauli-Villars regularization and have obtained a gauge\ninvariant result. However, they have used a less general version of this regularization with the constraint\nthat the gauge invariance of the Lagrangian density is preserved. As a consequence, no Chern-Simons-like\nterm is generated. Therefore it was left no room for violation of gauge symmetry, and its preservation at\nb2 order brings no insight in what concerns the full amplitude. Moreover, the results of ref. [17] has not\nbeen discussed.\nIn our present work we adopt the Implicit Regularization (IR) method to perform a general analysis.\nFor the massless case, for example, we analyze the complete one-loop vacuum polarization tensor (all\norders in b). We show that the conditions to adjust the regularization dependent terms, in such a way\nthat gauge symmetry is preserved at b2 order (recall that according to IR these conditions are kept open\nuntil the end of the calculation), must be exactly the same as for its preservation at zero-th order in b.\nIn other words, if gauge symmetry is spoiled at b2 order, it is also spoiled in QED. Furthermore, the\nfunctional non-perturbative analysis carried out in the first part of section 2, based on ref. [22], shows\nthat the model is gauge invariant to all orders, as discussed in the paragraph before equation (8).\nFinally, we have also performed a critical discussion of some procedures that are commonly adopted in\nthe literature when shifts are done in divergent integrals and the corresponding surface terms calculated\nin a \"naive\" way. We show by comparing to the results obtained within IR, which is constructed to yield\nsymmetry preserving answers, that a naive implementation of surface terms may lead to inconsistencies\nand violation of symmetries even in the simplest case (QED).\nAcknowledgements\nWork supported in part by grants of Fundao para a Ci\u00eancia e Tecnologia, FEDER, POCI 2010,\nPOCI/FP/63930/2005 and 81296/2007.\nA.
