It exhibits a number of thermodynamic and dynamic anomalous properties [1]-[3], such as the maximum as a function of temperature both in density and\nin isothermal compressibility in the liquid phase. It\nhas been proposed some time ago that these anomalies\nmight be associated with a critical point at the terminus\nof a liquid-liquid line, in the unstable supercooled liquid region[4], at high pressures, following the suggestion,\nbased on varied experimental data [5], of a thermodynamic singularity in supercooled water, around 228K and\nat atmospheric pressure. Inspite of the limit of 235K below which water cannot be found in the liquid phase without crystallization, two amorphous phases were observed\nat much lower temperatures [6]. There is evidence, although yet under test, that these two amorphous phases\nare related to fluid water [7][8].\nNotwithstanding of its confirmation for metastable water, interest in liquid polymorphism arose, and the coexistence of two liquid phases was uncovered as a possibility\nfor a few other both associating and non-associating liquids. Notable examples include liquid metals [9], silica\n[10], phosphorus [11][12] and graphite [13]. The relation\nbetween liquid polymorphism and density anomaly has\nbeen a subject of debate in recent theoretical literature\n[14].\nFrom a microscopic point of view, water anomalies\nhave been interpreted qualitatively, since[15], in terms\nof the the presence of an extensive hydrogen bond network which persists in the fluid phase [16]. The hydrogen bond net deformation under temperature was represented in a number of minimal models for water. The\nmain strategy has been to associate the hydrogen bond\n\ndisorder with bond [17][18] or site [19][20] Potts states.\nIn the former case coexistence between two liquid phases\nmay follow from the presence of an order-disorder transition and a density anomaly is introduced ad hoc by\nthe addition to the free energy of a volume term proportional to a Potts order parameter. In the second case,\nit may arise from the competition between occupational\nand Potts variables introduced through a depedency of\nbond strength on local density states.\nWe propose a description also based on occupational\nand orientational degrees of freedom. However, for the\norientational part we employ a modification of the thermal version[21][22] of the ice model[23], so successful in\nthe description of ice entropy. Competition between the\nfilling up of the lattice and the formation of an open fourbonded orientational structure is naturally introduced in\nterms of the ice bonding variables and no ad hoc introduction of density or bond strength variations is needed.\nWe thus consider a lattice gas on a triangular lattice with\nsites which may be full or empty. Besides the occupational variables, \u03c3i , associated to each particle i there\nare six other variables, \u03c4iij , pointing to neighboring sites\nj: four are the usual ice bonding arms, two donor, with\n\u03c4iij = 1, and two acceptor, with \u03c4iij = \u22121, while two additional opposite arms are taken as inert (non-bonding),\n\u03c4iij = 0, as illustrated in Fig. 1. Therefore each occupied\nsite is allowed to be in one of eighteen possible states.\nTwo kinds of interactions are considered: isotropic\n\"van der Waals\" and orientational hydrogen bonding. An\nenergy \u2212v is attributed to each pair of occupied neighboring sites that form a hydrogen bond, while non-bonding\npairs have an energy, \u2212v + 2u (for u > 0). The overall\nmodel energy is given by\nX\n\u03c3i \u03c3j {\u2212v + u[2 + \u03c4iij \u03c4jji (1 \u2212 \u03c4jij \u03c4jji )]}\n(1)\nE=\n(i,j)\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\naddress: vhenriques@if.usp.br\naddress:\nURL: http://www.if.ufrgs.br/~barbosa\n\u2020 Electronic\n\nbarbosa@if.ufrgs.br;\n\nwhere \u03c3i = 0, 1 are occupation variables and \u03c4iij = 0, \u00b11\nrepresent the arm states described above.\n\n\f2\n\nT=0.6\nT=0.5\nT=0.4\nT=0.7\nT=0.8\nT=0.9\nT=1.225\n\n9\n\n\u03c4=\n0=\n\n\u22121\n\n\u03c4=1\n\u03c4=\n\n\u03c4\n\u03c4=\n\n\u22121\n\n\u03c4=\n\n7\n0\n\n1\n\np\n\npar\n\n5\n\n3\n\nFIG. 1: The model orientational state: four bonding (donor\nand receptor) and two non-bonding arms\n\n1\n\n\u22121\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n\u03c1\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\nFIG. 3: Pressure vs. density isotherms for different temperatures.\n\nFIG. 2: Low density liquid, LDL with density 3/4 (top),\nand high density liquid, HDL witn density 1 (botton) on the\ntriangular lattice.\n\nInspection of the model properties allows the prediction of two ordered states, as shown in Fig. 2. One\nof them has lower density ,\u03c1 = 0.75, and energy density given by e = E/N = \u22123v/2. The other state has\nhigher density ,\u03c1 = 1, and energy density e = \u22123v + 2u.\nThe addition of an external chemical potential \u03bc may\nfavor one or the other of the two ordered states. At\nzero temperature, the low density liquid (LDL) coexists\nwith the high density liquid (HDL) at chemical potential\n\u03bc/v = \u22126 + 8u/v, obtained by equating the grand potential density (or pressure) associated with each one of\nthese phases. Similarly the coexistence pressure at the\nzero temperature is given by p/v = \u22123 + 6u/v. Besides\nthese two liquid states, a gas phase is also found and it\ncoexists with the low density liquid at chemical potential\n\u03bc/v = \u22122 and pressure p = 0. The condition for the\npresence of the two liquid phases is therefore u/v > 0.5.\nThe model properties for finite temperatures were obtained through Monte Carlo simulations in the grandcanonical ensemble using the Metropolis algorithm. Particle insertion and exclusion were tested with transition\nprobabilities given by\nw(insertion) = exp(\u2212\u2206\u03c6) and\nw(exclusion) = 1 if \u2206\u03c6 > 0\nor\nw(insertion) = 1 and\nw(exclusion) = exp(+\u2206\u03c6) if \u2206\u03c6 < 0\n\n(2)\n\nwith \u2206\u03c6 \u2261 exp{\u03b2(eparticle \u2212\u03bc)\u2212ln(18)} where eparticle is\nthe energy of the particle included. Since the empty and\nfull sites are visited randomly, the factor 18 is required\nin order to guarantee detailed balance.\nSimulational data were generated both from fixed temperature and fixed chemical potential simulations. Some\ntest runs were done for L=4, 10 and 20. A detailed study\nof the model properties and the full phase diagrams was\nundertaken for an L=10 lattice, at fixed u/v = 1[24].\nRuns were of the order of 106 Monte Carlo steps.\nThe three phases obtained at zero temperature are\npresent for low temperatures, as can be seen in the\nisotherms of Figure 3. The model exhibits two first order\nphase transition lines, gas-LDL and LDL-HDL, respectively.\nIn order to obtain the complete phase diagram, including the two critical points, and to check for density\nanomalies, pressure was computed by numerical integration of the Gibbs Duhem equation, SdT \u2212 V dP + N d\u03bc =\n0, at fixed temperature. Integration was carried out from\neffective zero density, at which pressure is zero, to obtain\nP (\u03c1, T ) isotherms.\nThe pressure isotherms show that an inversion of the\nbehavior of density as a function of temperature takes\nplace at intermediate pressures, in the LDL phase. At\nsmaller pressures ,p \u223c 1, density decreases with temperature, whereas at higher pressures ,p \u223c 3, density increases with temperature. This yields a density anomaly\nin the higher range of pressures, which we illustrate in\nFig 4.\nFinally, from a large set of temperatures, we build\nup the pressure versus temperature coexistence curves\nshown in Fig. 5. The line of maximum densities is also\nshown. The liquid-liquid coexistence line has a positive\ninclination, except at very low temperatures (the zero\ntemperature points do not come from simulations, but\n\n\f3\n0.9\n\n0.8\n\n\u03c1\np=2.9\np=2.8\np=2.7\np=2.6\np=2.4\np=2.2\np=2\np=1.92\n\n0.7\n\n0.6\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\nT\n\n1\n\n1.2\n\n1.4\n\nFIG. 4: Density Anomaly for different pressures\n4\n\nHDL\n\nC'\n\n3\n\nTMD\n\n2\n\nP\n\nLDL\n1\n\nC\n\n0\n\nGas\n\u22121\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\nT\nFIG. 5: Phase Diagram.

From the Clapeydp\n\u2206s\nron condition, dT\n]coex = \u2206v\n, the positive slope implies\nthat within our model the HDL phase has lower entropy\nthan the LDL phase.\nInside each phase, the density anomaly can be related\nto the behavior of entropy as a function of pressure. From\nthermodynamics, a negative thermal expansion coeffi\u2202v\ncient \u03b1 \u2261 ( \u2202T\n)p implies a positive gradient of entropy\n\u2202v\n\u2202s\nwith pressure, since ( \u2202T\n)p = \u2212( \u2202p\n)T . This property has\nbeen thought [14] to imply that the presence of a density\nanomaly would lead to a high entropy high density phase,\nand therefore to a negative slope of the coexistence line,\n\nas is true for the ice fusion line. The present model proves\nthat this assumption is misfounded and that this is not\na general behavior.\nWhat we have here is the following: on the low density side, the thermal expansion coefficient is negative,\nwhereas on the high density phase it is positive, as can\nbe gathered from the pressure-density isotherms. The\npositive slope of the coexistence line implies, by ClausiusClapeyron, that the high density phase is the lower entropy phase. Thus, at constant temperature, entropy\nincreases with pressure up to the coexistence line, drops\ndiscontinuously across this line, and then decreases with\npressure, as in any normal liquid. Therefore the sign\nof entropy variation across the coexistence line may be\neither positive, as in this model, or negative, as in the\nfusion of ice, following, in both cases, the high pressure \u03b1\nsign.\nThe model proposed is a truly statistical model which\nincludes orientational and occupational variables, and\nguarantees the local distribution of hydrogens on molecular bonds, without the need of increasing the volume\nartificially or introducing artificial orientational variables. Inspite of the absence of an orientational orderdisorder transition [22], the model presents liquid-liquid\ncoexistence, with positive inclination in the pressuretemperature plane, accompanied by a line of maximum\ndensity, on the low density side, a feature expected for\nwater. Besides, this study points out to the fact that the\npresence of a density anomaly, with \u03b1 < 0, on the low\ntemperature side, and as a consequence, ( \u2202S\n\u2202p )T > 0, does\nnot imply a negative slope of the liquid-liquid line, contrasting with the results for most studies of metastable\nliquid-liquid coexistence in models for water, which suggest a transition line with negative gradient [25].\nThe presence of both a density anomaly and two liquid\nphases in our model begs the question of which features\nof this potential are responsible for such behaviour. Averaged over orientational degrees of freedom, our model\ncan be seen as some kind of shoulder potential, with\nthe liquid-liquid coexistence line being present only for\na repulsive, soft-core potential. The same was indeed\nobserved for continuous step pair potentials [14][26], for\nwhich, however, the density anomaly is absent. On the\nother hand, a density anomaly seems to be associated\nwith smooth soft core potentials [27][28], which would\nbe hidden, in our model, in the orientational degrees of\nfreedom.\nIn summary, we have found that a lattice gas with\norientational ice-like degrees of freedom can generate a\ndensity anomaly and a liquid-liquid phase boundary with\npositive slope.\n\nAcknowledgments\nThis work was supported by the brazilian science agen-\n\n\f4\ncies CNPq, FINEP, Fapesp and Fapergs.\n\n[1] F.
