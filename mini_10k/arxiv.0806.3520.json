A particularly\ndramatic issue is related to Nambu\u2013Lie algebras [4, 6\u201314]. Already in [5] it\nwas noted that there are only very restricted possibilities for certain types\nof a non-trivial Nambu\u2013Lie 3-algebra. This subject was further developed\nby [15\u201318]. Thus the only \"compact\", i.e. having positive scalar product\nfinite dimensional algebra was found to be the four-dimensional algebra A4\nwith structure constants given by the totally anti-symmetric four-dimensional\ntensor [9, 19].1\nOn leave from : Institutul de Fizic\u0103 Aplicat\u0103 A\u015e, str. Academiei, nr. 5, Chi\u015fin\u0103u,\nMD2028 Moldova; e-mail: sochichi@sogang.ac.kr\n1\nThere also exist less restrictive higher order algebras called Generalized Lie Algebras,\nbased on the Schouten-Nijenhuis bracket [20] classified in [21]. For their comparison to\nNambu\u2013Lie 3-algebras considered here see [22].\n\u2217\n\n1\n\n\fOn the other hand, for the viability of the multiple M2-brane model we\nneed an infinite family of algebras parameterized by an integer parameter,\nwhich can be interpreted as the number of M2-branes.\nIn fact, giving up the Euclidean metric or finite dimension requirement\nallows one to construct various 3-algebras from Lie algebras by an uplift\nprocedure. It is clear that all such 3-algebras are either Lorenzian or infinitedimensional [23\u201325].\nIn this work we propose a construction of representations of Nambu\u2013Lie\n3-algebras in terms of matrix operators subject to Nambu commutation relations. The construction is based on the fact that the Nambu\u2013Lie 3-algebra\nincludes a set of underlying Lie algebra structures, which are obtained by\nfixing a Nambu\u2013Lie 3-algebra element. Then the Nambu\u2013Lie algebra representation should be split into irreducible representations of the underlying Lie\nalgebra. Choosing such Lie algebra representations from which the 3-algebra\nrepresentation (re)constructed solves the problem.\nThe case of four-dimensional Euclidean 3-algebra A4 is considered here in\nmore details. It appears that this 3-algebra can not be represented, in spite\nof its Euclidean nature, in terms of sole Hermitian matrices. The uplift of a\nrepresentation of a compact Lie algebra requires complex eigenvalues for the\nfixed element parameterizing the underlying Lie algebra. Although it is not\nclear wether the setup of our construction is the most general one, it seems\nthat this feature of 3-algebra representations is quite general.\nIn spite of the fact that the role of representations of 3-algebras in the\ntheory of multiple M2-branes is not yet clear, we hope that understanding the\nrepresentations may be useful also for a better understanding of the latter.\nThe plan of the paper is as follows. In the next section we define the matrix representation for a 3-algebra and describe the requirements it should\nsatisfy. Next, we give a general construction of such a representation. After\nthat we specify to algebra A4 for which we find the explicit form of representations. Then we analyze the two-dimensional representation in most general\ncontext, but find that this case too in fact reduces to the previous one.\n\n2\n2.1\n\nLie algebra induced representation\nObjectives\n\nConsider a Nambu\u2013Lie 3-algebra defined as the linear span of generators\n{Ta }, a = 1, . . . , D subject to the following 3-bracket relation,\n[Ta , Tb , Tc ] = ifabc d Td ,\n2\n\n(2.1)\n\n\fwhere fabc d are the structure constants, which are anti-symmetric in the lower\nindices and subject to Fundamental Identity,\nfa1 a2 ba fa3 a4 a5 b = fa1 a2 a3 b fba4 a5 a + fa1 a2 a4 b fa3 b2 a5 a + fa1 a2 a5 b fa3 b2 a5 a ,\n\n(2.2)\n\nfor all a. The indices are lowered and raised respectively by the Killing metric\nhab and its inverse. Next we chose the basis in which hab = \u03b4ab . In this basis\nthe structure constants are totally anti-symmetric. Also we suppose that\nthe structure constants fabc d are non-degenerate in the sense that there exist\n\"dual structure constants\" f \u0303abcf such that,\nf \u0303abc f fabc d = \u03b4fd .\n\n(2.3)\n\nThis is not a very constraining requirement, in any case any semi-simple Lie\nalgebra satisfies an analogue of this. In the case of totally anti-symmetric\nstructure constants f , the dual constants can be chosen to be anti-symmetric\ntoo.\nOur aim is to construct a matrix representation R(A) such that the\nNambu-Lie bracket is mapped to the Nambu commutator [5],\n[A, B, C]N = ABC + BCA + CAB \u2212 BAC \u2212 ACB \u2212 CBA,\n\n(2.4)\n\nwhere A, B, C \u2208 R(A).\n\n2.2\n\nGeneral construction\n\nAs is known a Nambu-Lie n-algebra generates a family of lower degree\nNambu-Lie algebras. In the case of 3-algebra one has a family of Lie brackets\nparameterized by an element \u03be~ \u2208 A,\n~ g, f ],\n[g, f ]\u03be~ \u2261 [\u03be,\n\n~ g, f \u2208 A.\n\u03be,\n\n(2.5)\n\nAs pointed in [15], the restricted bracket (2.5) is anti-symmetric in g and f\nand satisfies the Bianchi identity, therefore a Nambu\u2013Lie algebra contains\nincorporated Lie algebra structures.\nIn the case when the 3-algebra basis is not fixed or it is invariant with\nrespect to rotations (as in the case of the four-dimensional algebra considered\nbelow), we can chose \u03be to be along D-direction: \u03be~ = \u03beTD . Since \u03be enters\nhomogeneously in (2.4), its value is not relevant, therefore we can generically\nset \u03be = 1. Then the underlying (d \u2212 1)-dimensional Lie algebra is defined by\nthe commutation relations,\n[Ti , Tj ]tD \u2261 [TD , Ti , Tj ] = ifijk Tk ,\n3\n\n(2.6)\n\n\fwhere fijk = fDijk , i, j, k = 1, . . . , D \u2212 1.\nSince we seek a \"unitary\" representation of 3-algebra, it is natural to\nassume, that the the matrix representing TD can be diagonalized within this\nrepresentation. Consider the subspace corresponding to the eigenvalue tD .\nThe Nambu\u2013Lie commutator on such a space reduces to2\n[Ti , Tj ]tD = tD [Ti , Tj ],\n\n(2.7)\n\nwhere [*, *] is the usual matrix commutator. In order to satisfy the Nambu\u2013\nLie commutation relations (2.6), the reduced representation on tD subspace\nshould satisfy the following matrix commutation relations,\n[Ti , Tj ] = it\u22121\nD fijk Tk .\n\n(2.8)\n\nLet us consider the situation when the underlying algebra is a semi-simple\nLie algebra. Then the tD -eigen-space is split into irreducible representations\nof the semi-simple algebra. The irreducible representations of the algebra\n(2.7) correspond to eigen-spaces of the quadratic Casimir operator,\nC2 (T ) = t\u22122\nD c2 (\u03c4 ),\n\n(2.9)\n\nwhere c2 (\u03c4 ) is the quadratic Casimir of the tD -independent algebra with\nstandardized commutation relations,\n[\u03c4i , \u03c4j ] = ifijk \u03c4k ,\n\n(2.10)\n\nwhere \u03c4i = tD Ti .\nNow let us pick up a particular irreducible representation and let us compute the following quantity restricted to this representation,\n \u0303ijk D fjkl \u03c4i \u03c4l ,\ntD \u2261 TD = \u2212i f \u0303ijk D [Ti , Tj , Tk ]N = 3t\u22123\nD f\n\n(2.11)\n\nwhere we make use of the total anti-symmetric property of f \u0303abc d . This implies\nthat the value tD of the matrix TD should satisfy,\nt4D = f \u0303ijk D fjkl \u03c4i \u03c4l ,\n\n(2.12)\n\nwhere the r.h.s. depends only on the details of the representation of the\nLie algebra and should be related to the value of Casimir operator. So, the\neigenvalue of T4 is expressed as the fourth power root from the r.h.s of (2.12).\nIt is clear, that if the r.h.s fails to be positive, the representation can not be\nrealized in terms of Hermitian matrices.\n2\n\nNote that here we abusively denote both algebra generators and the their representation as Ti .\n\n4\n\n\fIn the case in which the r.h.s. of (2.12) contains beyond the Casimir also\na Lie-algebra part, the consistency with Nambu\u2013Lie commutation relation\nrequires that this part should vanish. It is not clear how restrictive this\ncondition is since not much is known on Nambu\u2013Lie algebras in general,\nhowever in the case of A4 3-algebra considered below this does not imply\nany additional constraints.\nIrreducibility\nConstructing matrix representations of a Nambu\u2013Lie algebra, one shall ask\nher/himself about the criteria of irreducibility of the representation. If we\ndefine an irreducible representation as one for which the representation module has no invariant subspaces others than itself or zero element, then if we\nrestrict ourself to a subspace with definite value of TD , the irreducibility of\nNambu\u2013Lie algebra representation follows directly from the irreducibility of\nthe underlying Lie algebra representation.\nIt is worth noting that this definition also leads to a 3-algebra analog\nof Schur's Lemma. Indeed, any operator which is Nambu commuting with\nany two arbitrary elements of the 3-algebra should commute in the sense of\nLie algebra commutation with all generators of the underlying Lie algebra\nand, therefore, be proportional to the identity operator on each irreducible\nrepresentation of the latter. That is not all, however. The Nambu bracket\ninvolving two Lie algebra generators reads,\n0 = [Ti , Tj , X] = [Ti , Tj ]X = iXfijk Tk \u21d2 X = 0,\n\n(2.13)\n\nwhere we used the fact that X is commuting with all generators Ti following\nfrom the other Nambu bracket relations,\n0 = [TD , Ti , X]N = [Ti , X]TD + [X, TD ]Ti \u21d2 [Ti , X] = 0,\n\n(2.14)\n\nfor a irreducible underlying Lie algebra representation. Then the 3-algebra\nanalogue of the Schur's lemma is somehow more restrictive:\nLemma 1 There are no central elements in an irreducible representation of\na Nambu Lie 3-algebra except the trivial one: X = 0.\nIn particular this implies that there are no analogues of Casimir operators\nfor 3-algebras.\n\n5\n\n\f2.3\n\nAlgebra A4\n\nSo far the only known nontrivial example of Euclidean finite-dimensional 3algebra is the four dimensional algebra A4 , which is generated by the Nambu\u2013\nLie commutation relations,\n[Ta , Tb , Tc ] = i\u01ebabcd Td ,\n\n(2.15)\n\nwhere \u01ebabcd is the four-dimensional totally anti-symmetric tensor with \u01eb1234 =\n+1. Moreover, there is a strong evidence [7, 9, 15, 19] that it is the only\nnon-trivial Euclidean 3-algebra in finite dimensions.\nAs A4 is invariant with respect to SO(4) rotations, all underlying Lie\nalgebras are related by a SO(4) rotation and are isomorphic to su(2). Therefore, the choice of T4 for the reduction of the Nambu\u2013Lie bracket into a Lie\nalgebra is a generic one. The underlying Lie algebra commutation relations\nare,\n[Ti , Tj ]T4 = \u2212i\u01ebijk Tk , i, j, k = 1, 2, 3,\n(2.16)\nwhere \u01ebijk is the three-dimensional totally anti-symmetric tensor with \u01eb123 =\n+1.\nOn the other hand, the Nambu bracket commutation relations reduced to\nan eigen-space of T4 transform to the following matrix commutator relations,\n[Ti , Tj ] = \u2212it\u22121\n4 \u01ebijk Tk .\n\n(2.17)\n\nIrreducible (2j + 1)-dimensional representations of the Lie algebra generated by (2.17) are parameterized by the half-integer spin j. The Casimir\noperator is given by,\n2\n\u22122\nTi2 = t\u22122\n(2.18)\n4 \u03c4i = t4 j(j + 1).\nConsideration of the leftover Nambu\u2013Lie bracket [T1 , T2 , T3 ] gives the constraint on the value of T4 ,\nit4 \u2261 iT4 = [T1 , T2 , T3 ]N = T1 [T2 , T3 ] + T2 [T3 , T1 ] + T3 [T1 , T2 ]\n2\n2\n2\n\u22123\n= \u2212it\u22121\n4 (T1 + T2 + T3 ) = \u2212it4 j(j + 1), (2.19)\nfrom which we have\nt44 = \u2212j(j + 1).\n\n(2.20)\n\nAs one can see it is not possible in this simple setup to represent the\nalgebra A4 in terms of Hermitian matrices only.3\n3\n\nLet us note that this type of representations were first considered in [26] (see also [7]),\nbut it seems that the minus sign in front of t44 was mishandled in both papers.\n\n6\n\n\f2.4\n\nNonconstant T4 representation\n\nOne may be concerned that the impossibility to find a unitary representation\nof A4 is related to the fact that we considered only the representations with\na constant value of T4 . This implies that T4 commutes with other three\ngenerators Ti on each irreducible space. One may wonder whether giving up\nthe commutativity of T4 may improve the situation.\nFor non-commuting T4 the Nambu commutator (2.15) reduces to the following Lie bracket,\n[A, B]]T4 \u2261 T4 [A, B] + [A, B]T4 \u2212 AT4 B + BT4 A.\n\n(2.21)\n\nOne can consider this relation as a T4 dependent deformation of usual commutation relations. Therefore, a dj -dimensional representation in terms of\nbracket (2.21) should be a deformation of an ordinary matrix representation\nof the underlying Lie algebra.\nConsider the algebra A4 . Here let us limit ourselves to the two-dimensional\nrepresentation of the underlying algebra su(2). The deformed commutation\nrelations in this case read,\n\u03bc[\u03c4i , \u03c4j ] + [\u03c4i , \u03c4j ]\u03bc \u2212 \u03c4i \u03bc\u03c4j + \u03c4j \u03bc\u03c4i = i\u01ebijk \u03c4k ,\n\n(2.22)\n\nwhere the generators \u03c4i , i = 1, 2, 3 are 2\u00d72-dimensional \u03bc-dependent matrices\nwhile \u03bc \u2261 T4 , for notational convenience.\nTo find a \"solution\" for the commutation relations (2.22) let us expand\neverything in terms two-dimensional Pauli matrices,\n\u03bc = \u03bc0 I + \u03bc\u03b1 \u03c3\u03b1 ,\n\n\u03c4i = \u03c40 I + \u03c4i\u03b1 \u03c3\u03b1 .\n\n(2.23)\n\nSubstituting this expansion into (2.22) yields,\n2\u03bc0 \u01eb\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3 \u03c4i\u03b1 \u03c4j\u03b2 \u03c3\u03b3 + 6\u03bc\u03c3 \u01eb\u03b1\u03b2\u03c3 \u03c4i\u03b1 \u03c4j\u03b2 = \u01ebijk (\u03c4k\u03b1 \u03c3\u03b1 + \u03c4k0 ).\n\n(2.24)\n\nThe equation (2.24) is satisfied iff each of the following equalities hold,\n2\u03bc0 \u01eb\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3 \u03c4i\u03b1 \u03c4j\u03b2 = i\u01ebijk \u03c4k\u03b3 ,\n\n6\u01eb\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3 \u03c4i\u03b1 \u03c4j\u03b2 \u03bc\u03b3 = \u01ebijk \u03c4k0 .\n\n(2.25)\n\nThe equalities (2.25) can be equivalently rewritten as,\n[\u03c4\u0302i , \u03c4\u0302j ] = i\u03bc\u22121\n0 \u01ebijk \u03c4\u0302k ,\n\n\u03c4\u0302i = \u03c4i\u03b1 \u03c3\u03b1 /2\n\n(2.26)\n\nand\n\u22121\n\u03c4k0 = 23 \u03bc\u22121\n0 tr \u03bc\u0302\u03c4\u0302k = 3\u03bc0 \u03bc\u03b1 \u03c4k\u03b1 .\n\n7\n\n(2.27)\n\n\fTo complete the solution to the problem, let us note that for arbitrary\nmatrix \u03bc the solution for \u03c4\u0302i satisfying (2.26) is given up to a unitary transformation in terms of Pauli matrices: \u03c4\u0302i = \u03c3i /(2\u03bc0 ) and \u03c4k0 = 32 \u03bck /\u03bc20 . Plugging\nthese results into the leftover Nambu commutator we obtain the equality,\n3 \u22123\n\u03bc = \u2212i[\u03c41 , \u03c42 , \u03c43 ] = \u2212\u03bc\u22123\n0 \u03bck \u03c4\u0302k \u2212 4 \u03bc0 ,\n\n(2.28)\n\nfrom which we get,\n\u03bc40 = \u22123/4,\n\n\u03bck = 0,\n\n(2.29)\n\ni.e. the representation reduces to one considered in the previous subsection.\nTaking the above results we may conjecture that complex values of T4 are\nunavoidable in general.\n\n3\n\nDiscussion\n\nIn this work we give a construction for irreducible representations of a Nambu\u2013\nLie 3-algebra in terms of representations of underlying Lie algebras. It appears that irreducibility of the Lie algebra automatically leads to the irreducibility of the entire Nambu\u2013Lie 3-algebra representation.\nApplied to the case of four-dimensional 3-algebra A4 the construction\nresults in representations, which necessarily require matrices with eigenvalues\nwhich are fourth root of \u22121. This means that such representations can not\nbe built entirely of hermitian matrices.\nOn the other hand, if we consider a Lorenzian 3-algebra which is obtained\nby the uplift procedure from the Lie algebra the mechanism of sign flip in\nthe metric seem to be very similar to the sign flip in our construction. In\nthis case one may expect that Lorenzian 3-algebras may be represented in\nterms of Hermitian generators. If it is the case, it is very much in contrast\nto what we have in Lie algebra representations.\n\nAcknowledgements\nI thank Hai Lin for correspondence and finding typos in the manuscript as\nwell as Jose A. de Azcarraga for drawing my attention to Generalized Lie\nalgebras as an alternative to Nambu\u2013Lie ones considered here.
