Munday\nDepartment of Physics, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA 02138\nFederico Capasso\nSchool of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA 02138\nThe Casimir force, which results from the confinement of the quantum mechanical zero-point fluctuations\nof the electromagnetic fields, has received significant attention in recent years for its effect on micro- and\nnano-scale mechanical systems. With few exceptions, experimental observations have been limited to\nconductive bodies interacting separated by vacuum or air. However, interesting phenomena including\nrepulsive forces are expected to exist in certain circumstances between metals and dielectrics when the\nintervening medium is not vacuum. In order to better understand the effect of the Casimir force in such\nsituations and to test the robustness of the generalized Casimir-Lifshitz theory, we have performed the first\nprecision measurements of the Casimir force between two metals immersed in a fluid. For this situation, the\nmeasured force is attractive and is approximately 80% smaller than the force predicted by Casimir for ideal\nmetals in vacuum. We present experimental results and find them to be consistent with Lifshitz's theory.\n\nprecision methods were not developed for nearly\nfour decades [9-12]. A multitude of experimental\ntechniques have been used to study Lifshitz's\ntheory in the van der Waals regime (typically\nbelow 10nm surface separation) [13-17].\nMeasurements between metallic surfaces in water\nhave been performed using AFM [18]; however,\nas with most van der Waals force measurements,\nlittle attention was given to surface roughness\ncorrections or absolute distance determination.\nOther techniques have been developed for\nprecision, long-range Casimir force measurements\nbetween\nmetals\nin\nvacuum\nusing\nMicroElectroMechanical Systems (MEMS) [12],\nAFM [10], and variety of torsional- and springbased techniques for plate-plate and plate-cylinder\ngeometries [11, 19].\nMore recently, attempts have been made\nto study the Casimir force under modified\nboundary conditions. Experiments have been\nperformed between dissimilar metals [20], a metal\nand a semiconductor [21], a bulk metal and a thin\nfilm [22], and materials whose reflectivity in the\nvisible range can be switched from reflective to\ntransparent [23]. However, all of these\nmeasurements have been performed on\nconductive materials separated by vacuum or air.\nHere we present detailed measurements of\nthe Casimir force between metals separated by a\nmedium other than vacuum/air. This method\nallows one to tune the Casimir-Lifshitz force in\nways not possible in vacuum. We show that the\nintroduction of ethanol screens the Casimir force\n\nAccording to quantum electrodynamics,\nfluctuations of the electromagnetic fields occur in\nvacuum and result in a zero-point energy given by\n\nE=\n\n1\n\u2211 h\u03c9 i , where the sum is evaluated over\n2\n\nthe angular frequencies \u03c9i of the normal modes.\nThe introduction of two grounded, charge neutral\nmetallic plates modifies the boundary conditions\nof these fluctuations, causing the fields to go to\nzero at the plates' surfaces. This reduces the sum\nof the angular frequencies by excluding some of\nthe normal modes and alters the zero-point\nenergy. The energy associated with this\nconfiguration as a function of plate separation can\nbe obtained by subtracting the zero-point energy\nwhen the plates are at a finite separation d from\nthat corresponding to an infinite separation. The\nderivative of this energy yields a force, which was\nfirst predicted by H. G. B. Casimir in 1948 [1].\nDuring\nthe\n1950s-60s,\nLifshiftz,\nDzyaloshinskii, and Pitaevskii generalized\nCasimir's result to included dielectrics [2, 3]. This\nformalism, based on the fluctuation-dissipation\ntheorem, relies on the knowledge of the dielectric\nfunctions of the interacting materials to compute\nthe force. In the case of small surface separations,\nthis formalism provides a complete description of\nthe non-retarded van der Waals interaction [4-6].\nFor larger separations between uncharged ideal\nmetals, Casimir's result is obtained.\nExperimental observations of the Casimir\nforce began in the late 1950s [7, 8], although\n\n1\n\n\fRAPID COMM\n\nA\n\nB\n\nC\n\nD\n\nTO APPEAR IN PHYSICAL REVIEW A\n\nMAY, 2007\n\nfor 30 minutes in ethanol followed by drying in\nnitrogen airflow. The cantilever chip is similarly\nrinsed with ethanol and nitrogen without\nultrasonic cleaning to avoid damaging the\ncantilever. The liquid ethanol used for the\nexperiment contains <0.1% H2O (Sigma-Aldrich)\nand is filtered through a 0.2\u03bcm PTFE filter. Once\nassembled, the experiment is allowed to\nequilibrate for one hour prior to measurements.\nFor all experiments, the cantilever is completely\nsubmerged and no evidence of micro-bubbles or\nparticle contamination is seen.\nA laser (1mW at \u03bb=860nm) is reflected\noff the cantilever into a four-quadrant\nphotodetector for monitoring the cantilever\ndeflection (Fig. 1). Any vertical displacement or\nbending of the cantilever can be detected through\nthe difference signal between the top two\nquadrants and the bottom two quadrants of the\nphotodetector. A piezoelectric column drives the\ncantilever toward the plate, which is monitored\nusing a Linear Variable Differential Transformer\n(Asylum Research) to ensure accurate detection of\ndisplacements and to avoid nonlinearities and\nhysteresis inherent to piezoelectrics. The\ninteraction between the sphere and the plate is\nthen detected through the motion of the cantilever\nas the sphere approaches the plate. The inset of\nFig. 1 depicts the relative motion of the cantilever\nwith respect to the laser, which results in an\nartificial deflection signal. This signal was\ndetermined to be independent of surface\nseparation and is removed from the final data.\nThe photodetector voltage signal is\nconverted into a force signal through calibration\nwith a known force. The deflection of the\ncantilever\nobeys\nHooke's\nlaw:\nFspring = \u2212k dcantilever , where dcantilever is the\ndistance the tip of the cantilever has bent and k is\nthe spring constant of the cantilever. When an\nexternal force is applied to the cantilever, an\nequilibrium condition is reached when\nFexternal = k dcantilever . In order to determine the\ndcantilever\nfrom\nthe\ndeflection\ndistance\nphotodetector signal, the piezoelectric column\nmoves the cantilever toward the surface of the\nplate until the sphere and plate are in contact, and\nthe normal force of the plate against the sphere\ncauses a linear deflection of the cantilever versus\npiezo displacement.

A 100nm gold\nlayer is then evaporated onto both sides of the\ncantilever to create a metallic front surface for the\nCasimir force interaction and a reflective backside\nnecessary for the laser deflection measurement\ntechnique. Nearly equal film thicknesses are\nnecessary on both sides of the cantilever in order\nto reduce cantilever curvature due to material\nstresses induced at the surface interface. An\nadditional 10nm of gold is evaporated at sharp\nangles with respect to the cantilever in order to\nensure electrical continuity of the evaporated film\nand the metallized sphere. The cantilever is\ninserted into a commercially available AFM\n(Asylum Research MFP-3D) containing a fluid\ncell for measurements.\nPrior to setup, standard cleaning\nprocedures are performed on all surfaces.

For ethanol\nthe reduction factor is \u03b5 ethanol = 24.3 , the\ndielectric constant. Thus, a different method is\nneeded to determine the spring constant. Other\ncommon methods for determining the spring\nconstant without making a direct force\nmeasurement (e.g. thermal [24], added mass [25]\nor Sader [26] methods) are considerably less\naccurate. To avoid this problem, we have adapted\na method which uses a hydrodynamic force rather\nthan an electrostatic force to determine the force\nconstant [27].

It was recently shown that the calculated\nforce between two metals in vacuum can vary by\nas much as 5% due to the variation in the optical\nproperties of gold which occur for different\nsamples [32]. The inclusion of a third material\n(ethanol), whose optical properties are less well\nknown, should further increase the theoretical\nuncertainty to above 5%. Surface roughness\nfurther modifies the calculation of the CasimirLifshitz force. The total force including this\ncorrection can be written as [33]:\nF (d ) = \u2211 vi( sp ) v (j pl ) FC \u2212 L (d \u2212 (\u03b4 i( sp ) + \u03b4 (j pl ) )) , (4)\ni, j\n\nwhere vi is the fraction of the surface area of the\nsphere (sp) or plate (pl) displaced a distance \u03b4 i\nfrom an ideally smooth surface. The values for vi\nas a function of \u03b4 i are measured using an optical\nprofiler over a 2\u03bcm x 2\u03bcm section [34].\nFigure 3 shows the comparison between\nour experimental data and theory. The calculation\nof the Casimir force for ideal metals (not shown)\noverestimates it by a factor of ~4.5, while\nLifshitz's theory for gold surfaces in ethanol\nwithout the roughness correction (dotted line)\ngenerally underestimates the measured force.\n\n\u239b \u03b5 0 V0 2\n\u239e\u03c0 R\n= \u2212\u239c\u239c\n+ 6\u03b7 v R \u239f\u239f\n\u239d \u03b5 ethanol\n\u23a0 d\n\nand is 2pN at 40nm compared to the CasimirLifshitz force of -260pN.\nThe experimental data is compared to\nLifshitz theory for a gold plate interacting with a\n\n4\n\n]\n\n\fRAPID COMM\n\nTO APPEAR IN PHYSICAL REVIEW A\n\nLifshitz force between metals and dielectrics in\nfluid, which raises the intriguing possibility of\nachieving quantum flotation using repulsive QED\nforces.\nThe authors would like to acknowledge\nM.

The\nmagnitude of the measured force appears to be\napproximately 5-10pN larger than the theory in\nthe range 50-100nm and is consistently smaller\nbelow 50nm, where the roughness corrections\nbegin to breakdown. For comparison, Lifshitz's\ntheory including roughness corrections for two\ngold surfaces separated by vacuum (dashed line)\nis plot in Fig. 3 and is larger than the measured\nforce by a factor of ~2.\nWhile the force constant \u03b1 has an error\nof <2% and the theory is believed to be accurate\nto within ~5% as previously discussed,\ncomparison between theory and experiment\ncannot be made at this level.

For our experiment,\n\n\u03b4d 0 = \u00b13 nm , which corresponds to a 25%\nuncertainty in the comparison at a separation of\n50nm. To achieve a level of 2%, the uncertainty in\nd 0 would need to be reduced to a few angstroms.\nThis is the leading source of error in the\ncomparison at small separations and is often\noverlooked in the literature (for a critic of related\nliterature see Iannuzzi et al. [35]).\nCalculations have recently shown that\nrepulsive interactions may be achieved using a\nmetallized sphere above a silica plate immersed in\nethanol [36]. Repulsive forces could be of great\nimportance for technological applications by\ncounter-balancing gravity to suspend one surface\nabove another at close range using no classical\nelectromagnetic forces. For a 100\u03bcm radius gold\nsphere 50nm above a silica plate, the resulting\nrepulsive force is 135pN. Using a technique\nsimilar to the one presented here a measurement\nof this long-range quantum electrodynamical\nrepulsion should be measurable.\nIn conclusion, we have conducted the first\nprecision measurements of the Casimir-Lifshitz\nforce between two metal surfaces (gold) separated\nby a fluid (ethanol). The results were found to be\nconsistent with Lifshitz's theory, and errors were\ndiscussed. A straightforward extension of this\nmethodology could be used to study the Casimir-\n\n5\n\n\fRAPID COMM\n\nTO APPEAR IN PHYSICAL REVIEW A\n\n[32]\nI. Pirozhenko, A. Lambrecht, and V. B.
