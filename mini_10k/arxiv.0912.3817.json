We present first results for correlations between\nFermi-LAT and our 15 GHz observations.\n\n1. INTRODUCTION\nBlazars are a subclass of active galactic nuclei characterized by rapid variability, strong linear polarization at visible wavelengths, apparent superluminal\nmotions, flat radio spectrum and double-peaked spectral energy density. They are further divided into two\ntypes: BL Lacs and Flat Spectrum Radio Quasars\n(FSRQs). BL Lacs have almost no emission lines,\nstrong polarization and are preferentially found in elliptical galaxies. FSRQs have broad and narrow emission lines, strong polarization and are more luminous\nthan BL Lacs. It is believed that all AGN are powered\nby an accreting super-massive black hole and that the\ndifferent classes, blazars included, are due to differences in the observing angle and the presence or absence of jets. In this picture blazars would be objects\nwith a jet oriented close to the line of sight.\nGiven the broad-band spectral energy distributions\nand the variability of these objects, a complete understanding of them requires multiwavelength and multiepoch data. The Large Area Telescope (LAT) on\nFermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope provides gammaray light curves for the brightest objects. These can be\ncombined with our radio data and other data sets in\norder to investigate the relation between blazar properties at different energy bands.\nA statistically large sample with high-cadence is required to answer questions about the relation between\ngamma-ray and radio emission. The radio data by itself can be used to characterize the variability properties of these large sample and study their variations\namong different classes. Questions that can be addressed are for example: Are all blazars equally variable on long time scales? Different populations or\nsmooth variation over the properties? What are the\ncharacteristic time scales? Are there correlations between variability characteristics and physical properties of central black hole and/or jet.\nTo address some of these issues we have embarked\neConf C091122\n\non an extensive monitoring program in the radio band.\nThe OVRO 40-Meter Telescope monitoring program\nis part of the Fermi -GST Multi-wavelength Monitoring Alliance (F-GAMMA) project [Fuhrmann et al.\n2007, Angelakis et al. 2008]. The other component of\nthe project consist of monthly multifrequency monitoring of 60 sources selected by historically interesting\nbehavior. Observations are carried out with the Effelsberg 100 m and Pico Veleta 30 m telescopes at 12\nfrequencies between 2.7 and 270 GHz. Combination\nof these two programs allows detailed study of the\nspectral evolution for the small sample, and population studies for the large high-cadence single frequency\nsample.\nHere we present first results for the study of correlated variability using Fermi -LAT observations and\nradio light curves from our monitoring program.\n\n2. OBSERVATIONS\nGamma-ray light curves for the brightest sources\ncan be obtained from Fermi -LAT observations. This\nhas been done on weekly time scales for the source on\nthe LBAS sample [Abdo et al. 2009] using the first\n11 months of Fermi -LAT observations. Details on the\nFermi -LAT instrument and the data reduction can be\nfound in other articles in these conference proceedings\nor elsewhere.\nObservations of all the sources with \u03b4 > \u221220\u25e6 from\nthe Candidate Gamma Ray Blazar Survey (CRGaBS)\n[Healey et al. 2008] have been carried out using the\nOVRO 40-Meter Telescope at 15 GHz. The sources\nhave been observed about twice a week since mid-2007\nwith a thermal noise floor of about 5 mJy. Observations are made using a dual-beam Dicke-switch system. The individual beams are 2.5' FWHM; they are\nseparated by 13'. The cryogenic HEMT receiver has a\nnoise temperature of \u223c30 K and covers the band from\n13.5 to 16.5 GHz. Results based on the radio data\n\n1\n\n\f2\n\n2009 Fermi Symposium, Washington, D.C., Nov. 2-5\nonly are presented by Richards et al. [2009] on this\nconference proceedings.\n\nmake any such definitive statements. A publication\naddressing these issues is in preparation.\n\n3. FIRST RESULTS\nOne of the basic questions we want to explore is\nthe presence of simultaneous variability in radio and\ngamma-ray bands. The first step is to determine the\npresence of variability for the sources in both bands.\nUsing a \u03c72 test to evaluate the probability of a constant source producing the observations, it is found\nthat \u223c 75% of the sources are variable at the 99.9%\nconfidence level in both bands and only \u223c 6% are\nnot variable in either band. The rest of the sources\n(\u223c 19%) are variable in one of the two bands. The basic observation is that objects that vary at gamma-ray\nwavelengths are almost always also variable at radio\nwavelengths over period of time included in our observations. The few exceptions are probably due to\nsampling, duty cycle, low level of variability effects\namong other possible causes.\nTo address the question of the timing between\nthe activity at the two bands we have used crosscorrelations. These cross-correlation are investigated\nusing the method described in Edelson and Krolik\n[1988]. This method allows the use of unevenly sampled light curves such as the ones used in this study,\nbut doesn't provide a quantification of the significance\nof the observed correlations. This issue will be addressed in a publication in preparation.\nWe include some of our cross-correlation results\nhere to give an example of the quality of the data on\nthe two bands (Fig. 1). In view of the fact that the\nflares in these plots often last for a significant fraction\nof the duration of the observations, it is not surprising that high cross-correlations are seen. This does\nnot, however, indicate that these events are related at\nthe two frequencies. Given the short duration of the\nlight curves, it is not yet possible to determine if the\nsingle observed gamma-ray flare is related to the observed radio flare, or to one occurring before/after and\nnot included in the observations. Careful statistical\nanalysis and longer duration observations are needed\nbefore any statistical significance can be attached to\nthese correlations.\n\n4. CONCLUSIONS\nIt is clear from the observations that very interesting behavior occurs at both frequencies, but it is\npremature at this stage to try to associate specific\nfeatures seen at gamma-ray frequencies with features\nseen at radio frequencies, or vice versa, or to claim\nthat a specific gamma-ray feature leads, or lags, a\nspecific radio feature. Longer term monitoring and\ncareful statistical analyses are required before we can\neConf C091122\n\nAcknowledgments\nThe Fermi LAT Collaboration acknowledges generous ongoing support from a number of agencies\nand institutes that have supported both the development and the operation of the LAT as well as scientific data analysis.
