Introduction\nThe high proper-motion star NLTT 11748 was identified as an\nextremely low mass (ELM) white dwarf by Kawka & Vennes\n(2009). The first ELM white dwarfs were discovered to\nbe companions to neutron stars (e.g., van Kerkwijk et al.,\n1996; Bassa et al., 2003), but recent follow-up observations of ELM white dwarfs identified in colourimetric or\nproper motion surveys (e.g., SDSS, NLTT) often find them\nto be in a close binary with a white dwarf companion (e.g., SDSS J125733.63+542850.5, Badenes et al., 2009;\nKulkarni & van Kerkwijk, 2010; Marsh et al., 2010). The companions of several other ELM white dwarfs found to be in close\nbinary systems are yet to be formally identified, but they are\nlikely to be more massive white dwarfs (see, Ag\u00fceros et al.,\n2009a,b).\nThe stellar and kinematical properties of NLTT 11748\n(Kawka & Vennes, 2009) and of two similar objects, LP400-22\n(Kilic et al., 2009; Vennes et al., 2009) and SDSS J1053+5200\n(Kilic et al., 2010), also suggest that they are old halo stars.\nThe constraints placed on their total ages help retrace the\nprior evolution of these systems (see Tauris & Savonije, 1999;\nNelemans et al., 2001; Nelson et al., 2004).\nThe formation of ELM white dwarfs requires that the systems go through at least two phases of mass transfer, where the\nsecond mass transfer phase strips the less massive companion of\nits outer envelope before the helium ignition. This generic scenario appears valid whether the more massive component is a\nneutron star or a white dwarf (see for example Nelemans et al.,\n2001; Nelson et al., 2004). An example of a possible progenitor\nto an ELM white dwarf is the bright subluminous B (sdB) star,\nHD 188112 (Heber et al., 2003). The subdwarf star has a lower\n\u22c6\n\nBased on observations at the European Organisation for\nAstronomical Research in the Southern Hemisphere, Chile under programme ID 84.D-0862.\n\nmass than average, 0.24 versus \u223c 0.5 M\u2299 (Zhang et al., 2009),\nand orbits a degenerate companion with a mass >\n\u223c 0.73 M\u2299 every 14.6 hours. The subdwarf is a likely progenitor of a helium\nwhite dwarf similar to NLTT 11748. On the other hand, a possible progenitor to an ELM white dwarf with, this time, a neutron\nstar companion is SDSSJ102347.6+003841 (Wang et al., 2009).\nThis is a close binary comprising a G-type star and a 1.69ms pulsar (Archibald et al., 2009) with an orbital period of 4.75 hours.\nAlthough the spectral type of the visible component implies a\nmass of \u2248 1 M\u2299 , the mass ratio of the system dictates a much\nlower mass of \u223c 0.2 M\u2299 suggesting that the star is significantly\nevolved with a helium-enriched core. This system probably represents a first link between low-mass X-ray binaries and ELM\nplus neutron star binaries (Archibald et al., 2009).\nWe report new observations that help clarify the nature of\nthe ELM white dwarf NLTT 11748. We obtained two sets of intermediate resolution spectra that show that NLTT 11748 is in a\nclose binary system (Sect. 2). Our analysis of the spectroscopic\ndata and a first determination of the binary parameters are presented in Sect. 3. We discuss our results in Sect. 4 and summarise\nin Sect. 5.\n\n2. Observations\nWe observed NLTT 11748 with the FORS2 spectrograph attached to the UT1 - Antu at Paranal on UT 2009 October 22\nand 23. We used the 1200R grism combined with a slit width of\n1\", which provided a resolution of 3.0 \u00c5. The spectra were obtained as part of a programme aimed at detecting and measuring\nmagnetic fields in hydrogen-rich white dwarf stars. The observation sequence consists of two consecutive exposures with the\nWollaston prism rotated by 90 degrees between them. In principle, a magnetic field may cause an apparent velocity offset in\npairs of exposures, but our analysis of the radial velocity measurements excludes the effect of a magnetic field (Sect. 3.1).\n1\n\n\fA.

We used the\nT2KB detector and the KPC-24 grating (860 lines/mm) in second order centred on H\u03b1. We employed the GG495 filter to block\nout contamination from the first order. We set the slit width\nto 1.5\", which provided a resolution of 0.8\u00c5 (full-width halfmaximum).\nAll spectra were wavelength-calibrated using comparison\narc (HeNeAr) exposures. The stability of the wavelength scale\nwas verified through Oi sky lines, which remained stable with a\nstandard deviation of 3 km s\u22121 . All data were reduced with standard procedures within IRAF. Figure 1 and Table 1 show our\nspectra and the observation log.\n\n3. Analysis\n3.1. Binary parameters\n\nWe used the H\u03b1 line centre to measure the radial velocity of\nNLTT 11748. We fitted a Gaussian profile to the deep, narrow\ncore. Repeated measurements varying the fitting window from\n2 to 5\u00c5 from the line centre were averaged, leaving residuals\nof 3 to 10 km s\u22121 depending on the signal-to-noise ratio of the\nspectrum. The velocities were then corrected to the solar system\nbarycentre. We verified the procedure by cross-correlating each\nspectrum with a template built by co-adding all spectra in the rest\nframe (see Fig. 1) and comparing the resulting velocities to the\nGaussian fits. With a window from 6500 to 6620 \u00c5, we found\nthat the two methods differ by \u22063 = 1.4 \u00b1 3.5 km s\u22121 for the\nhigher quality FORS2 spectra, and \u22063 = 3.2 \u00b1 12.0 km s\u22121 for\nthe R-C spectra. Accordingly, the FORS2 and R-C spectra are\nweighted 4:1 in the orbital analysis. Table 2 lists the barycentric\nmid-exposure times and velocities.\nWe determined the orbital parameters by fitting sinusoidal\nfunctions to the radial velocities, where the period (P), mean\nsystemic velocity (\u03b3), the velocity semi-amplitude (K) and the\ninitial epoch (T 0 ) are varied. Figure 2 shows the periodogram\nand best-fit radial velocity curve. The significance values are\ndrawn at 66%, 90% and 99%. The average of the residuals is\n\u223c 3 km s\u22121 , commensurate with our estimates of the wavelength\nscale accuracy. Although the FORS2 spectra were obtained with\nthe Wollaston prism in place, the low residual value excludes a\nsignificant magnetic field. A more detailed spectropolarimetric\nanalysis will be reported elsewhere.\nThe best-fit parameters are\nP = 0.235061 \u00b1 0.000003 d,\nT 0 (BJD UT) = 2455126.712 \u00b1 0.003,\n2\n\nFig. 1. Spectra obtained with VLT FORS2 (left) and the KPNO\nR-C spectrograph (right). The spectra are labeled with the orbital\nphase (Sect. 3.1) and the top spectra are the co-added phasecorrected spectrum for each spectrograph.\nwhere T 0 is the initial epoch of superior conjunction of the unseen companion. We also determined the systemic velocity\n\u03b3sym = 136.5 \u00b1 0.9 km s\u22121\nby subtracting the gravitational redshift of the white dwarf\n(vg = 2.0 \u00b1 0.4 km \u22121 ) from the apparent systemic velocity\nof \u03b3 = 138.5 \u00b1 0.8 km s\u22121 . The gravitational redshift of the\nwhite dwarf was calculated assuming the parameters derived in\nKawka & Vennes (2009). The observed velocity semi-amplitude\nis\nK = 274.8 \u00b1 1.5 km s\u22121 ,\nwhich corresponds to a mass function for the unseen companion\nf = 0.5054 \u00b1 0.0083 M\u2299 .\nAdopting a mass of 0.167 M\u2299 for the white dwarf\n(Kawka & Vennes, 2009) and using our orbital parameters, we\ninfer a minimum mass for the unseen companion of 0.75 M\u2299 . A\nmain-sequence companion with a mass of 0.75 M\u2299 would have\nan absolute magnitude of MV \u223c 7 (Henry & McCarthy, 1993),\nwhich would clearly outshine a white dwarf with MV = 9.7.\n\n\fA.

(Bottom)\nResiduals of the sinusoidal fit.\nWe re-evaluated the kinematics of the system with the new\nsystemic velocity to obtain (U,V,W) = (-163,-252,-29) km s\u22121 .\nThese updated values clearly place NLTT 11748 in the halo.\nTwo other ELM systems whose kinematics place them in the\nhalo are LP400-22 (Vennes et al., 2009) and SDSSJ1053+5200\n(Kilic et al., 2010) with the remaining systems (without a neutron star) apparently belonging to the disc (Kilic et al., 2010).\n3.2. Constraints on a white dwarf companion\n\nAlthough Kawka & Vennes (2009) achieved a satisfactory fit to\nthe Balmer line profiles, their analysis did not consider a companion. We repeated that analysis using two composite model\ngrids, DA+DC or DA+DA. We modelled the primary with a\npure-hydrogen model grid (DA) and the secondary with either\na pure-helium (DC) or a DA grid. First, we set the mass of\nthe secondary to 0.75M\u2299 . We fitted the Balmer line profiles\n(see Kawka & Vennes, 2009, for details of the NTT-EFOSC2\nspectrum) varying three parameters: the temperature and surface\ngravity of the primary (T eff,p , log gp ) and the effective temperature of the secondary (T eff,s). The total flux was obtained by combining the primary and secondary surface fluxes weighted by the\nemitting area: R2 ftot = R2p fp + R2s fs , where R is the effective radius of the composite star, and Rp and Rs are the primary and secondary radii computed using the evolutionary mass radius relations of Benvenuto & Althaus (1999) and Serenelli et al. (2002).\nNote that the flux composition takes into account the calculated\norbital phase of the observed spectrum and the corresponding\noffset in velocities between the two stars. The combined spectrum is then fitted to the observed spectrum with \u03c72 minimization techniques.\nThe best-fit parameters from the DA+DA grid are T eff,p =\n8580 \u00b1 50 K (1\u03c3) and log gp = 6.18 \u00b1 0.15 for the primary\nand T eff,s \u2264 9600 K for the secondary. The flux contribution\nfrom the secondary at 5500\u00c5 (V-band) is \u2264 5% of the total flux.\nBut if we used the DA+DC grid we obtained an upper limit of\nT eff,s \u2264 7200 K, with a flux contribution \u2264 2%. Setting the sec-\n\nFig. 3.

In summary, the best-fit parameters are identical to the single star solution obtained by Kawka & Vennes (2009), and we conclude that\nthe secondary star is much fainter than the primary star.\n\n4. Discussion\nIf the maximum mass of a white dwarf is 1.35 M\u2299 , a white dwarf\ncompanion would be expected for inclinations i > 51\u25e6 . Ultramassive white dwarfs have been found to be either single or in\nclose binary systems (Vennes & Kawka, 2008), as in the peculiar binary system RX J0648.0\u22124418 (Mereghetti et al., 2009).\nConstraining the secondary mass between 1.35 and 0.75 M\u2299, the\nsystem is not expected to merge before 5.1 to 7.8 Gyr. In the\nlow-mass range the merger would create an ultramassive white\ndwarf, while in the upper mass range the system would constitute a Type 1a supernova candidate.\nFigure 3 shows the locus of the ELM binary systems in\na period versus ELM mass diagram. The data from Table 3\nare compared to the mass-period relations from the WD+NS\nbinary evolutionary scenarios of Nelson et al. (2004) and\nTauris & Savonije (1999). Similar trends are also predicted for\nthe brighter star in binary systems with two white dwarf stars\n(Nelemans et al., 2001). Figure 3 also includes the long period\nWD+NS system PSR B0820+02d (Koester & Reimers, 2000).\nThis particular system extends the apparent correlation toward\nhigher mass (0.60 \u00b1 0.08 M\u2299 ) and longer period (1232.5 d).\nTable 3 first provides the parameters of NLTT11748, followed\nby the parameters of systems containing white dwarfs with a\nneutron star companion (NS+WD), and double white dwarf systems (WD+WD). Finally, we list the parameters of the possible\n3\n\n\fA. Kawka et al.: The double degenerate system NLTT 11748\n\nprogenitors of ELM white dwarf binary systems. Some scatter\nbetween the mass of the brighter star and the orbital period is\nclearly visible, but a correlation is still observed between the\ntwo parameters. The models of Tauris & Savonije (1999) appear\nto better represent the observed trend than those of Nelson et al.\n(2004). The two outstanding points that are significantly off\nthe predicted relationship of either models are the two systems\nwith very short periods (SDSSJ1053+5200, SDSSJ1436+5010:\nKilic et al., 2010; Mullally et al., 2010). Overall, WD+WD and\nWD+NS systems overlap in the diagram, so this trend alone does\nnot allow one to distinguish between WD+WD and WD+NS\nsystems.\nThe ELM white dwarfs that are companions to neutron stars\nappear to be very faint (V > 20) with the brightest known\nELM companion to a neutron star with an apparent magnitude\nof V = 19.6 (PSR J1012+5307). The binary systems containing\nan ELM white dwarf and either a confirmed or probable white\ndwarf companion are significantly brighter, with apparent visual\nmagnitudes ranging from 16.5 up to 19.3, with NLTT 11748 the\nbrightest of the sample. In terms of distances we find that the\nWD+WD sample lies within a range of 0.1-1.6 kpc at an average distance of 0.75 kpc, while the WD+NS sample lies within a\nrange of 0.15-4.4 kpc at an average distance of 1.5 kpc. Located\nat a distance of 0.4 kpc and being the brightest known ELM,\nNLTT 11748 fits well within the relatively closer and brighter\nclass of WD+WD systems. Moreover, NLTT 11748 is not associated with a known radio source, therefore based on these\nconsiderations alone we may conclude that the companion to\nNLTT 11748 is another white dwarf with a mass above average.\nIndeed, after this work was submitted for publication,\nSteinfadt et al. (2010) announced the discovery of primary and\nsecondary eclipses in NLTT11748 confirming the secondary star\nas a white dwarf. Their analysis confirms the ELM nature of the\nprimary star and corroborates our analysis of the binary properties. Their orbital period measurement, based on eclipse timing,\nagrees with our spectroscopic period within error bars. Finally,\nour ephemeris allows us to identifiy the primary and secondary\neclipses observed by Steinfadt et al. (2010) with the corresponding orbital conjunctions.\n\n5. Conclusions\nWe find that the ELM white dwarf NLTT 11748 is part of a shortperiod binary system (P = 5.64 hrs). Based on our orbital analysis alone, we find that the minimum mass of the companion is\n0.75 M\u2299. However, the companion has independently been identified as a faint white dwarf (Steinfadt et al., 2010), and assuming a mass of 0.75M\u2299, we constrained the companion temperature to \u2264 9600 K (DA) or \u2264 7200 K (DC). The kinematics of\nNLTT 11748 also place the system in the Galactic halo.\nAcknowledgements.
