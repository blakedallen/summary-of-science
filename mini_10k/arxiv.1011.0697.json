Introduction\nThe search for wireless power transfer techniques is as old as the invention\nof electricity. From Tesla, trough the vast technological development during the\n20th century till recent days, many proposals have been made and implemented\nin this research field. Established techniques for wireless energy transfer are\nknown both in the near- and far-field coupling regimes. Examples for the former\ncan be found in resonant inductive electric transformers [1], optical waveguides\n[2] and cavity couplers [3]. In the far field, one can find the mechanism of transferring electromagnetic power by beaming a light source to a receiver which\nis converted to usable electrical energy [4]. Although these techniques enable\nsufficiently efficient energy transfer, they suffer either from the short-range interaction in the near-field, or from the requirement of line of sight in the far-field\napproaches. Recently, it was shown that weakly radiative wireless energy transfer between two identical classical resonant coils is possible with sufficiently high\nefficiency [5, 6, 7]. This breakthrough was made possible by the application of\nthe coupled mode theory into the realm of power transfer. In this experiment,\nKurs et. al. [5] showed that energy can be transferred wirelessly at distances of\nabout 2 meters (mid-range) with efficiency of about 40%.\n\u2217 These\n\nauthors contributed equally to this work\nEmail address: rangelov@phys.uni-sofia.bg (A. A. Rangelov)\n\nPreprint submitted to Elsevier\n\nOctober 15, 2018\n\n\fCurrently, most efficient wireless energy transfer devices rely upon the constraint of exact resonance between the frequencies of the emitter (the source)\nand the receiver (the device, or the drain) coils [5, 6, 7]. When the frequency of\nthe source is shifted from the frequency of the device, due to lack of similarity\nbetween the coils or by random noise (introduced, for example, by external objects placed close to either coils), a significant reduction of the transfer efficiency\nwould occur. In such case, one may implement a feedback circuit, as suggested\nin Ref. [5], in order to correct the reduction of the transfer efficiency.\nIn this paper, we suggest a different approach to resolve the issues of the\nresonant energy transfer process. Here, we present a novel technique for robust\nand efficient mid-range wireless power transfer between two coils, by adapting\nthe process of adiabatic passage (AP) for a coherently driven two-state quantum system [8, 9], as will be explained in the following sections. The adiabatic\ntechnique promises to be both efficient and robust for variations of the parameters driving the process, such as the resonant frequencies of the coils and the\ncoupling coefficient between them.\n2. Overview of the coupled mode theory\n\nFigure 1: (Color online) Methods for wireless energy transfer. (a) For constant coil frequencies,\nefficient transfer from the source to a device occurs only when \u03c9S = \u03c9D . (b) The proposed\nadiabatic technique, with time-varying coil frequency \u03c9S (t), can transfer energy to multiple\ndevices even when most of the time \u03c9S (t) 6= \u03c9D1 , \u03c9D2 .\n\nWe follow the description of the coupled mode theory in the context of wireless energy transfer as described in detail by Kurs et. al. [5]. The interaction\n\n2\n\n\fbetween two coils, in the strong-coupling regime, is described by the coupledmode theory, through the following set of two differential equations [3, 5]:\n\u0015\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u0015 \u0014\nd\naS (t)\naS (t)\n\u03c9S (t) \u2212 i\u0393S\n\u03ba(t)\n. (1)\n=\ni\naD (t)\n\u03ba(t)\n\u03c9D (t) \u2212 i\u0393D \u2212 i\u0393W\ndt aD (t)\nHere, aS (t) and aD (t) are defined so that the energies contained in the source\nand the drain are, respectively, |aS (t)|2 and |aD (t)|2 . \u0393S and \u0393D are the intrinsic\nloss rates (due to absorption and radiation) of the source and the drain coils,\nrespectively, and the extraction of work from the device is described by the term\n\u0393W . The intrinsic frequencies of the source and drain coils are \u03c9S (t) and \u03c9D (t);\nthese are given explicitly as\np\n\u03c9m (t) = 1/ Lm (t)Cm (t)\n(m = S, D),\n(2)\nwhere LS,D (t) and CS,D (t) are the inductance and the capacitance, respectively,\nof the source and the drain coils. The coupling coefficient between the two coils\nreads\ns\n\u03c9S (t)\u03c9D (t)\n\u03ba(t) = M (t)\n,\n(3)\nLS (t)LD (t)\n\nwhere M (t) is the mutual inductance of the two coils. The source coil is a part of\nthe driving circuit and is periodically recharged, while the energy is transferred\nwirelessly to the device coil. The dynamics of such process in the case of static\n(time independent) resonance frequencies, as describe in Ref. [5] is illustrated\nin Fig. 1 (top).\nThe evolution of Eq. (1) is connected to the dynamics of the Schr\u00f6dinger\nequation for a two-state atom written in the rotating-wave approximation [8, 9].\nThe variables aS (t) and aD (t) can be identified as the probability amplitudes\nfor the ground state (corresponding to the source) and the excited state (corresponding to the drain), respectively. The coupling between the coils are analogous to the coupling coefficient of the two-state atom (also known as the Rabi\nfrequency), which is proportional to the atomic transition dipole moment d12\nand the laser electric field amplitude E(t): \u03a9(t) = \u2212d12 * E(t)/~ [8, 9]. The\ndifference between the resonant frequencies of the two coils corresponds to the\ndetuning \u2206(t) in the two-state atom: \u2206(t) = \u03c9D (t) \u2212 \u03c9S (t).\nThe power transfer method was demonstrated for the resonant case of \u03c9S =\n\u03c9D = const, which is the case of \u2206 = 0 in atomic physics. However, the power\ntransmitted between the coils drops sharply as the system is detuned from\nresonance, i.e. for the case of \u03c9S 6= \u03c9D . Also, any time dependent dynamics\nor change of coupling strengths between the coils can results in lower energy\ntransfer between the coils.\n3. Adiabatic wireless energy transfer\nIn the following, we develop a systematic framework of the adiabatic criteria\nin the context of wireless energy transfer. The technique of adiabatic passage\n3\n\n\fwas successfully implemented in other research fields, such as nuclear magnetic\nresonance (NMR) [10, 11], interaction of coherent light with two level atoms\n[8, 9], or in sum frequency conversion techniques in nonlinear optics [12, 13].\nThis dynamical solution requires a time-dependent intrinsic frequency change of\nthe source coil \u03c9S (t). The variation of the frequency should be adiabatic (very\nslow) compared to the internal dynamics of the system that is determined by\nthe coupling coefficient.\nWe will first assume that the loss rates \u0393S , \u0393D and \u0393W are zero and write\nEq. (1) in the so-called adiabatic basis [8, 9] (for the two-state atom this is the\nbasis of the instantaneous eigenstates of the Hamiltonian):\n\u0015\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u0015 \u0014\nd b\u2212 (t)\nb\u2212 (t)\n\u2212\u03b5(t) i\u03b8\u0307(t)\ni\n,\n(4)\n=\nb+ (t)\ni\u03b8\u0307(t) \u03b5(t)\ndt b+ (t)\nwhere the dot denotes a time derivative and\np\n\u03b5(t) = 21 4\u03ba(t)2 + \u2206(t)2 ,\ntan 2\u03b8(t) =\n\n2\u03ba(t)\n.\n\u2206(t)\n\n(5a)\n(5b)\n\nThe connection between the original amplitudes aS (t) and aD (t) and the adiabatic ones b\u2212 (t) and b+ (t) is given by\nb\u2212 (t) = aS (t) cos \u03b8(t) \u2212 aD (t) sin \u03b8(t),\nb+ (t) = aS (t) sin \u03b8(t) + aD (t) cos \u03b8(t).\n\n(6a)\n(6b)\n\nWhen the evolution of the system is adiabatic, |b\u2212 (t)|2 and |b+ (t)|2 remain\nconstant [14]. Mathematically, adiabatic evolution means that the non-diagonal\nterms in Eq. (4) are small compared to the diagonal terms and can be neglected.\nThis restriction amounts to the following adiabatic condition on the process\nparameters [8, 9]:\n \u0307\n|\u03ba\u0307(t)\u2206(t) \u2212 \u03ba(t)\u2206(t)|\n\u226a [4\u03ba(t)2 + \u2206(t)2 ]3/2 .\n\n(7)\n\nHence adiabatic evolution requires a smooth time dependence of the coupling\n\u03ba(t) and the detuning \u2206(t), long interaction time, and large coupling and/or\nlarge detuning. In the adiabatic regime |b\u00b1 (t)|2 = const, but the energy contained in the source and the drain coil |aS,D (t)|2 will vary if the mixing angle\n\u03b8(t) varies; thus adiabatic evolution can produce energy transfer between the\ntwo coils.\nIf the detuning \u2206(t) sweeps slowly from some large negative value to some\nlarge positive value (or vice versa), then the mixing angle \u03b8(t) changes from \u03c0/2\nto 0 (or vice versa). With the energy initially in the first coil, the system will\nstay adiabatically in b\u2212 (t) and thus the energy will end up in the second coil.\nTherefore the detuning sweep (i.e. the frequency chirp) will produce complete\nenergy transfer. Furthermore, AP is not restricted to the shape of the coupling\n\u03ba(t) and the detuning \u2206(t) as far as the condition (7) is fulfilled and the mixing\nangle \u03b8(t) changes from \u03c0/2 to 0 (or vice versa).\n4\n\n\fThe variation of the detuning \u2206(t) can be achieved by changing the capacitance (or the inductance) of one, or the two coils. The time variation of the\ncoupling \u03ba(t) can be achieved, for example, with the rotation of one coil (or two\ncoils), thereby changing the geometry and thus the mutual inductance M (t) of\nthe two coils.\n\nEnergy [%]\n\n100\n2\n\n80\n\n|aD|\n2\n|aS|\n\n60\n40\n20\n\nEnergy [%]\n\n100\n\n2\n\n<|aD| >\n\n80\n\n2\n\n|aD|\n\n60\n\n2\n\n|aS|\n\n40\n20\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n-4\n\n-4\n\ntime [10 s]\n\ntime [10 s]\n\nFigure 2: (Color online) Comparison between the energy transfer as a function of time for\nthe AP case (top frames) and the static case (bottom frames), with no losses (left frames)\nand with loss \u0393S,D = 2 \u00d7 103 s\u22121 (right frames). In all the graphs, solid line refers to the\nsource coil, and dashed line refers to the device coil. For the static case, the functions \u03ba(t)\nand \u2206(t) are given by Eqs. (9) with the following parameters: \u03ba0 = 4 \u00d7 104 s\u22121 , \u03b4 = 0 s\u22121 ,\nwhereas for the AP case, they follow Eqs. (10) with the following parameters: \u03ba0 = 4 \u00d7 104\ns\u22121 , \u03b4 = 2 \u00d7 105 s\u22121 , \u03b2 = 3 \u00d7 109 s\u22122 .\n\nWhen the loss rates are nonzero, the dynamics become more complicated\nand more realistic. Nevertheless, the essence of AP remains largely intact, if\none follow another important constraint,\n\u0393S,D < \u03ba0 < |\u2206(t)|.\n\n(8)\n\nwhich states that the coupling coefficient also should be larger than the loss\nrates, and that the initial and final detunings are larger than the coupling coefficient [8, 9]. The physical reasoning behind it is that the dynamics should be\nfaster then the damping rates that exist in the system (mainly on the device)\nand not only adiabatic. In Fig. 2 we compare the resonant (static) and adiabatic\n5\n\n\fmechanisms, without losses (left frames) and with losses (right frames). For the\nnumerics, we used the following coupling and detuning for the resonant case:\n\u03ba(t) =\n\n\u03ba0 ,\n\n(9a)\n\n\u2206(t) =\n\n\u03b4,\n\n(9b)\n\nand for the adiabatic mechanism:\n\u03ba(t)\n\n= \u03ba0 ,\n\n(10a)\n\n\u2206(t)\n\n= \u03b4 + \u03b2(t \u2212 t0 ),\n\n(10b)\n\nwhere for our simulations we set t0 = 10\u22124 s. As can be seen in Fig. 2 the\nenergy in the static case oscillates back and forth between the two coils. In\nAP, once the energy is transferred to the drain coil it stays there. This feature\nof AP is used to minimize the energy losses from the source coil. We see that\nwhen following the adiabatic constraints, the AP process outperforms the static\nresonant method.\nTo describe the efficiency of the proposed technique we use the efficiency\ncoefficient \u03b7, which is the ratio between the work extracted from the drain for\nthe time interval T divided by the total energy (absorbed and radiated) for the\nsame time interval,\n\u03b7=\n\n\u0393W\n\u0393S\n\nRT\n0\n\nRT\n0\n\n|aD (t)|2 dt\n\n|aS (t)|2 dt + (\u0393D + \u0393W )\n\nRT\n0\n\n|aD (t)|2 dt\n\n.\n\n(11)\n\nIn the static steady state case, the efficiency reads [5]\n\u03b7=\n\n\u0393W |aD |2\n.\n\u0393S |aS |2 + (\u0393D + \u0393W )|aD |2\n\n(12)\n\nAs can be seen from Eq. (11), in order to maximize \u03b7, one should reduce\nthe time that the energy stays in the source coil. This cannot be obtained in\nthe resonant (static) case, because the energy oscillates back and forth between\nthe source and the drain coils. Nevertheless, in the AP mechanism, there is\nonly one transition between the source and the device, so it should be chosen\nto be as early as possible. The AP dynamics (or any other time-dependent\ndynamics) should also repeat itself after some repetition time Trep . This is\nillustrated in Fig. 3. The time scale is of the order of several \"loss times\" (equal\nto 1/\u0393S,D,W ), in this way we ensure that each cycle of coil charging begins, after\nthe consumption of all the energy from the previous cycle, otherwise interference\nappears, which will be difficult to be predicted analytically. For the propose AP\ntechnique we assume that energy is instantly loaded into the source coil without\nloss in the beginning of each cycle.\nAnother important measurement is the amount of energy transferred from\nthe source coil to the device, which is the useful energy consumed as a function\nof time. This measurement is in fact equal to the nominator in Eq. (11).\n6\n\n\fFigure 3: (Color online) The function of the resonant frequency of the source coil. The static\ncase is shown in red, and the repeated linear case (which is the simplest realization or the AP\ndynamics) is shown in blue.\n\n4. Simulations\nIn order to compare AP and the static mechanisms for energy transfer,\nseveral sets of simulations were performed, measuring both conversion efficiency\nand total energy consumed by the device:\n\u2022 Comparison between efficiencies as a function of the detuning, for different\ndistances between the coils (determined by the ratio \u03ba/\u0393S,D );\n\u2022 Influence of variations in the coupling and the loss coefficients;\n\u2022 Robustness of the adiabatic energy transfer, for time-dependent coupling\ncoefficient.\nFirst, the effect of different resonant frequency between the source coil and\nthe device coil on the total wireless transfer efficiency were examined. For that\nwe changed only the resonance frequency of the device in each numerical run,\nfor two different distances between the coils: 0.8 meter and 1 meter between\nthe coils (where we used the same units and notations as reported in Ref. [5]).\nFig. 4 shows that AP is less sensitive to the static detuning \u03b4. As can be\nshown, the maximal conversion efficiency is achieved for the resonance approach\nis symmetric about zero detuning, while AP is asymmetric with its maximal\nefficiency value shifted toward the positive detuning. The explanation is that\nthen the energy transfer occurs at early stage and therefore the energy stays\nless time in the source coil.\nNext, we examine the effect of different coupling and loss coefficients. Fig. 5\nshows contour plots of the efficiency coefficient \u03b7 as a function of the coupling \u03ba0\nand the loss rate of the source and the drain coils (where we assumed \u0393S = \u0393D ),\nwhere we assume fix values of \u0393W (i.e. cannot be changed for different value\n7\n\n\f20\n\n40\n\n10\n\n20\n\n40\n\n80\n\n30\n\n60\natic\nAdiab\n\n40\n\nat\nSt\n\n20\n\nic\n\n10\n\n-30\n\n20\n\n-15\n\n0\n\n15\n\nEfficiency \u03b7 [%]\n\n60\n\nEfficiency \u03b7 [%]\n\natic\nAdiab\n\ntic\n\nUseful energy\nconsumed [%]\n\n30\n\n80\n\na\nSt\n\nUseful energy\nconsumed [%]\n\n40\n\n30\n\n4 -1\n\n\u03b4 [10 s ]\n\nFigure 4: (Color online) Efficiency coefficient \u03b7 (right y-axes) and the useful energy consumed\n(left y-axes) as a function of the static detuning. The blue solid line depicts AP and the red\ndotted line is for the static method. The functions \u03ba(t) and \u2206(t) are given by Eqs. (9) for the\nstatic method and (10) for AP, with the following parameter values: (top frames) \u03ba0 = 5 \u00d7 104\ns\u22121 , \u03b2 = 3 \u00d7 109 s\u22122 , \u0393W = 104 s\u22121 , \u0393S = \u0393D = \u03ba0 /30 = 0.17 \u00d7 104 s\u22121 . (bottom frames)\n\u03ba0 = 5 \u00d7 104 s\u22121 , \u03b2 = 3 \u00d7 109 s\u22122 , \u0393W = 104 s\u22121 , \u0393S = \u0393D = \u03ba0 /17 = 0.29 \u00d7 104 s\u22121 .\n\nof coupling and loss coefficients). The upper frame presents results for the AP\ntechnique, while the lower frame is for the static method. AP is obviously more\nrobust to the change in the parameter values compared to the static method.\nThe scheme proposed here, which does not require feedback control, is therefore\nan alternative to the scheme suggested in [15].\nWe also wanted to check the effect of time-dependent coupling to the dynamics of energy transfer, which is a more realistic modelling to the process. When\nthe detuning is varied between the two coils, the coupling changes as well (can\nbe inferred from Eq. (3)). The maximal coupling coefficient value is expected\nto be obtained when the detuning is zero. For that, we chose the following time\ndependent detuning and coupling coefficient, respectively:\n\u2206(t) = \u03b4 + \u03b2(t \u2212 t0 ),\np\n\u03ba(t) = \u03ba0 \u2212 |\u2206(t)|,\n\n(13a)\n(13b)\n\nwhere for our simulations we set t0 = 10\u22124 s. Fig. 6 shows the corresponding\nenergy transfer efficiency as a function of time, along with the detuning and\ncoupling.\n\n8\n\n\fFigure 5: (Color online) Efficiency coefficient \u03b7 for AP (top frame) and the static case (bottom\nframe) versus the loss rate \u0393S \u2261 \u0393D and the coupling coefficient \u03ba0 . The functions \u03ba(t) and\n\u2206(t) are given by Eqs. (9) for the static method and (10) for AP, with the following parameter\nvalues: \u03b2 = 3 \u00d7 109 s\u22122 , \u03b4 = 2 \u00d7 105 s\u22121 , \u0393W = 104 s\u22121 .\n\n5. Conclusions\nIn conclusion, we have shown that the technique of adiabatic passage, which\nis well known in quantum optics and nuclear magnetic resonance, has analog\nin the wireless energy transfer process between two circuites. The factor that\nenables this analogy is the equivalence of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation for two-state\nsystem, to the coupled-mode equation which describes the interaction between\ntwo classical coils in the strong-coupling regime.\nThe proposed procedure transfers energy wirelessly in effective, robust manner between two coils, without being sensitive to any resonant constraints and\nnoise compared to the resonant scheme demonstrated previously. The application of this mechanism enables efficient energy transfer to several devices as well\nas optimizing the transfer for several distances and noise interferences.\nThis work has been supported by the European Commission projects EMALI\nand FASTQUAST, the Bulgarian NSF grants D002-90/08 and DMU02-19/09\nand Sofia University Grant 074/2010.\n9\n\n\f4 -1\n\n\u03ba(t) and \u2206(t) [10 s ]\n\n20\n15\n10\n5\n0\n-5\n-10\n\n\u2206(t)\n\u03ba(t)\n\nEnergy [%]\n\n100\n\n2\n\n80\n\n|aD|\n\n60\n\n|aS|\n\n2\n\n40\n20\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n-4\n\ntime [10 s]\nFigure 6: (Color online) Coupling and detuning (top frame) and energy transfer efficiency\n(lower frame) in AP for the case when the variation of the detuning induces time variation\nin the coupling; the latter are given by Eqs.
