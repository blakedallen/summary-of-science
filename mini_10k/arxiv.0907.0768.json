The High Energy Stereoscopic System\n(H.E.S.S.), located in the Khomas Highlands of\nNamibia, is an array of four imaging atmosphericCherenkov telescopes designed to detect \u03b3-rays in\nthe very-high-energy (VHE; E > 100 GeV) domain.\nIt is an ideal instrument for surveying the Galactic\nplane in search of new sources of VHE \u03b3-rays,\ndue to its location in the Southern Hemisphere, its\nexcellent sensitivity, and its large field-of-view. The\nH.E.S.S. Galactic Plane Survey (GPS) began in 2004\nand initial observations of the Galactic plane resulted\nin the discovery of numerous VHE \u03b3-ray emitters.\nThis original H.E.S.S. GPS covered the inner Galaxy\nwithin \u00b1 30\u25e6 in longitude and \u00b1 3\u25e6 in latitude, with\nrespect to the Galactic center. In the last four years,\nthe longitudinal extent of the survey has more than\ndoubled, now including the region l = 275\u25e6 \u2212 60\u25e6 ,\nand the exposure in the inner Galaxy has also\nbeen significantly increased. These efforts have consequently led to the discovery of many previouslyunknown VHE \u03b3-ray sources with high statistical\nsignificance. We report on the current status of this\nongoing, extended H.E.S.S. GPS, present the latest\nimages of the survey region, and highlight the most\nrecent discoveries.\nKeywords: H.E.S.S., Galactic Plane Survey, VHE\ngamma-rays\n\nThe current generation of imaging atmosphericCherenkov telescopes (IACTs) has opened a new astronomical window on the Universe in the very-highenergy (VHE; E > 100 GeV) domain. Twenty years\nafter the detection of the first TeV \u03b3-ray source, the\nCrab nebula [1], approximately 100 VHE \u03b3-ray sources\nhave now been discovered1 [2]. Over two-thirds of these\nsources are located in our Galaxy, of which most were\ndiscovered by the IACT array H.E.S.S. (High Energy\nStereoscopic System) during its ongoing Galactic Plane\nSurvey (GPS). VHE \u03b3-rays carry information about the\nmost extreme environments in the local Universe, and\nalthough a significant fraction of the Galactic VHE \u03b3ray sources do not appear to have obvious counterparts\nat other wavelengths [3] [4], the majority of them\nare associated with the violent, late phases of stellar\nevolution, e.g. supernova remnants (SNRs), pulsar wind\nnebulae (PWNe) of high spin-down luminosity pulsars,\nonline\n\nTeV\n\nII. T HE H.E.S.S. T ELESCOPE A RRAY\nH.E.S.S. is comprised of four, identical, 12-m diameter IACTs located at an altitude of 1800 m above\nsea level in the Khomas Highlands of Namibia [5].\nIts location in the Southern Hemisphere affords it an\nexcellent view of the inner Galaxy compared to most\nof the other IACTs, which are located in the Northern Hemisphere. Each of H.E.S.S.'s four telescopes is\nequipped with a camera containing 960 photomultiplier\ntubes and a tesselated mirror with a combined area of\n107 m2 [6]. The optical design allows for a comparatively large, 5\u25e6 field-of-view (FoV), the largest of all the\nIACTs currently in operation. The H.E.S.S. array has an\nangular resolution of \u223c0.1\u25e6 and an energy resolution of\n\u223c15%. Its unprecendented sensitivity to \u03b3-rays above\n\u223c100 GeV enables H.E.S.S. to detect a point source\nwith a flux \u223c1% of the Crab nebula with a statistical\nsignificance of 5 \u03c3 in just 25 hours of observations [5].\nThis high sensitivity, coupled with a large FoV, permits\nH.E.S.S. to effectively survey large areas of the Galaxy\nwithin a reasonable amount of time.\nIII.

I NTRODUCTION\n\n1 See\nTeVCat,\nan\nat http://tevcat.uchicago.edu.\n\nand massive Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars in stellar clusters.\nSince all of these astronomical objects are known to\ncluster along the Galactic plane, a comprehensive and\nsystematic survey of this region is an obvious approach\nfor discovering new sources of VHE \u03b3-rays.\n\n\u03b3-ray\n\ncatalog,\n\nA. The Original Survey in 2004\nThe H.E.S.S. Galactic Plane Survey began in 2004 and\nhas been a major component of the H.E.S.S. observation\nprogram ever since. The original GPS [12], conducted\nduring 2004, covered the region l \u00b1 30\u25e6 in longitude\nand b \u00b1 3\u25e6 in latitude, with respect to the Galactic\ncenter (GC). This large area (360 sq. deg.) corresponds\nroughly to the inner part of the Galaxy, from the Norma\nspiral arm tangent at l \u2248 327\u25e6 to the Scutum-Crux spiral\narm tangent at l \u2248 31\u25e6 [9]. Observations of 28-min\nduration each were taken at pointing positions separated\nin Galactic longitude by \u223c0.7\u25e6 . The systematic pointings\nwere distributed in three strips in Galactic latitude, at\nb = \u22121\u25e6 , 0\u25e6 and +1\u25e6 , covering a \u223c6\u25e6 -wide region\nalong the Galactic plane. In this scan mode, 95 h of\ndata were initially taken. Promising VHE \u03b3-ray source\ncandidates were then re-observed with dedicated pointed\nobservations, comprising an additional 30 h of data.\nFinally, known or presumed VHE \u03b3-ray sources were\nobserved, including the GC [10] and the shell-type\nSNR RX J1713.7\u22123946 [11]. In total, the original\n\n\f2\n\nR.C.G. CHAVES. H.E.S.S. GALACTIC PLANE SURVEY\n\nFig. 1. Image showing the pre-trials statistical significance in the H.E.S.S.

The recently-discovered VHE \u03b3-ray emission from Westerlund 1 is also not labeled. The\nsignificance is truncated above 15 \u03c3 to increase visibility, and the color transition (from blue to red) is set at 7.4 \u03c3 pre-trials significance, which\ncorreponds to 5 \u03c3 post-trials significance. See section III-B for more information.\n\n\fPROCEEDINGS OF THE 31st ICRC, \u0141\u00d3D\u0179 2009\n\n3\n\nH.E.S.S. GPS dataset included \u223c230 h of observations\nafter data quality selection.\nThe first phase of the H.E.S.S. GPS resulted in the\ndiscovery of eight, previously-unknown sources of VHE\n\u03b3-rays with a statistical significance greater than 6 \u03c3,\nafter accounting for all trials involved in that initial\nsurvey (post-trials) [8]. Additionally, six likely sources\nwere detected with post-trials significances above 4 \u03c3\n[12], all of which were subsequently confirmed with\ndeeper observations.\nB. Extending the Survey in 2005\u20132009\nIn the last four years, the H.E.S.S. GPS has been\nextended in Galactic longitude and now includes the\n145\u25e6 -wide region l \u223c 275\u25e6 \u2013 60\u25e6 [7]. The Survey now\nreaches two additional spiral arm tangents, SagittariusCarina at l \u2248 51\u25e6 and Crux-Scutum at l \u2248 310\u25e6 [9],\nand beyond, for a total area of 870 sq. deg. In addition\nto expanding the surveyed region, the overall exposure\nalong the Galactic plane has also increased significantly.\nThe total exposure of the GPS dataset has increased by\na factor of 6 from the initial \u223c230 h of observations to\nover 1400 h. Approximately 450 h of data were taken\nin survey mode, and an additional \u223c950 h of data are a\nresult of pointed observations.\nThe latest image of the pre-trials statistical significance in the extended H.E.S.S. GPS region is presented\nin Fig. 1. The image was created using calibrated,\nquality-selected data from observations during the period\nMarch 2004 to October 2008. The on-source counts\n(signal plus background) were summed from a circle\nof radius 0.22\u25e6 centered on each grid point. The background was then estimated from a ring with a mean\nradius of 1.2\u25e6 and an area \u223c7 times as large as the onsource region, also centered on each grid point. A grid\nspacing of 0.02\u25e6 was used to produce the image. The \u03b3hadron separation was performed using hard cuts (which\nrequire a minimum of 200 p.e. for each Cherenkov\nimage). Further details on the H.E.S.S. standard analysis\ncan be found in [5]. The minimum energy threshold and\nthe effective exposure-and, therefore, the sensitivity-\nvary considerably throughout this image. Efforts are\ncurrently underway to increase the uniformity of the\nexposure across the survey region.\nThe Galactic plane is clearly visible at VHE \u03b3-ray energies, with the vast majority of VHE \u03b3-ray sources\ndistributed at low Galactic latitudes. Figure 2 shows\nthe distribution of the H.E.S.S. GPS sources in Galactic\nlatitude. The distribution has a mean of b = \u22120.26\u25e6\nand an rms of 0.40\u25e6, not counting the four outliers at\nb < 2.0\u25e6 , This implies the Galactic plane as seen in\nVHE \u03b3-rays has a thickness of \u223c70\u2013120 pc in the inner\nGalaxy, compatible with the distribution of a presumed\nparent population of SNRs and pulsars. However, given\nthe non-uniform sensitivity of the H.E.S.S. GPS, this\nanalysis is still preliminary.\nThe official H.E.S.S. Source Catalog is available on-\n\nFig. 2. Distribution of the Galactic latitude b of all the VHE \u03b3ray sources in the extended H.E.S.S. GPS region. The distribution has\na mean b = \u22120.26\u25e6 and an rms of 0.40\u25e6 , not counting the four outliers\nat very low Galactic latitude.\n\nline2 and includes all of the VHE \u03b3-ray sources (Galactic\nand extragalactic) which were detected by H.E.S.S. and\nsubsequently published in refereed journals.\nIV. R ECENT D ISCOVERIES OF VHE \u03b3- RAY S OURCES\nH.E.S.S. is continually surveying the Galaxy for VHE\n\u03b3-ray source candidates and then following up on these\nsource candidates with dedicated, pointed observations.\nSome of the more recent H.E.S.S. discoveries are highlighted below:\n\u2022 HESS J1923+141: This new source is located in\nthe complex W 51 region, which hosts many highenergy phenomena, among them the SNR W 51C\n(G49.2\u22120.7). This partial shell-type SNR is interacting with a nearby giant molecular cloud (GMC),\nas evidenced by the presence of two OH(1720\nMHz) masers; in this scenario, VHE \u03b3-rays could\nbe produced by \u03c0 0 decay after hadronic interactions\nin the GMC. Competing scenarios involve leptonic\ninteractions associated with a PWN candidate in\nthe region, and, alternatively, an active star-forming\nregion within the GMC. See [14] for more information.\n\u2022 HESS J1741\u2212302: This very faint VHE \u03b3ray source was detected after deep observations\nof the GC region. The plausible counterparts are\ncurrently being studied; they include cosmic ray\ninteraction with MCs as well as a weak, offset PWN\nscenario. See [4] for more information.\n\u2022 HESS J1708\u2212443: One of the latest H.E.S.S. discoveries in the Galactic plane is in the vicinity of the energetic pulsar PSR B1706\u221244 and\nSNR G343.1\u22122.3. It is an extended source of\nVHE \u03b3-rays and has a relatively hard spectrum\n(\u0393 = 2.0 \u00b1 0.1stat \u00b1 0.2sys ). The H.E.S.S. source\ncould be associated with a relic PWN of the pulsar\nor with the SNR itself, two scenarios still under\ninvestigation. See [13] for more information.\n2 See\n\nhttp://www.mpi-hd.mpg.de/hfm/HESS/pages/home/sources\n\n\f4\n\nR.C.G. CHAVES. H.E.S.S. GALACTIC PLANE SURVEY\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\nHESS J1507\u2212622: This recently-discovered VHE\n\u03b3-ray emitter is unique due to its location relatively\nfar from the Galactic plane, at a Galactic latitude\nb \u223c \u22123.5\u25e6 . It is currently unidentified (or dark), i.e.\nthere are no plausible, lower-energy counterparts\nnearby, despite a comprehensive multi-wavelength\nsearch. See [4] for more information.\nWesterlund 1 region: H.E.S.S. has also recently\nannounced the discovery of VHE \u03b3-ray emission\nfrom the region of Westerlund 1, a massive young\nstellar cluster which is rich in WR stars.

The ongoing and extended Survey\nnow covers most of the Galactic plane as seen from the\nSouthern Hemisphere, specifically the region of Galactic\nlongitude l \u223c 275\u25e6 \u2013 60\u25e6 and latitude b = \u00b1 3\u25e6 . More\nthan 1400 h of observations have now been taken in\nthis region; these data come from a combination of\nsystematic, scan-mode observations, re-observations of\npromising VHE \u03b3-ray source candidates, and dedicated\nobservations of known or presumed VHE \u03b3-ray emitters.\nAs of May 2009, H.E.S.S. has detected a total of 52\nGalactic sources of VHE \u03b3-rays in or near the survey\nregion. While many of these sources are still unidentified\nor dark, the majority are thought to be associated with\nsome of the most energetic phenomena in our Galaxy, in\nparticular pulsar wind nebulae and supernova remnants.\nVI.
