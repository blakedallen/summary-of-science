Let Y be an orbifold and R a Q-algebra. In\nthe book [12] the author develops Kuranishi homology KH\u2217 (Y ; R) and Kuranishi cohomology KH \u2217 (Y ; R). The (co)chains in these theories are of the form\n[X, f , G] where X is a compact Kuranishi space, f : X \u2192 Y is a strongly\nsmooth map, and G is some extra gauge-fixing data. We prove KH\u2217 (Y ; R) is\nisomorphic to singular homology H\u2217si (Y ; R), and KH \u2217 (Y ; R) is isomorphic to\n\u2217\n(Y ; R). We also define Kuranishi bordism\ncompactly-supported cohomology Hcs\nKB\u2217 (Y ; R) and Kuranishi cobordism KB \u2217 (Y ; R), for R a commutative ring.\nThis paper is a brief introduction to selected parts of [12]. The length of [12]\n(presently 290 pages) is likely to deter people from reading it, but the main ideas\ncan be summarized much more briefly, and that is what this paper tries to do.\nA User's Guide, say for a car or a computer, should give you a broad overview of\nhow the machine actually works, and instructions on how to use it in practice,\nbut it should probably not tell you exactly where the carburettor is, or how the\nmotherboard is wired. This paper is written in the same spirit. It should provide\nyou with sufficient background to understand the sequels [2, 13, 14] (once I get\nround to writing them), and also to decide whether Kuranishi (co)homology is\na good tool to use in problems you are interested in.\nHere are the main areas of [12] that we will not cover. In [12] we also define\n\u2217\n(Y ; R), a variant on Kuranishi\neffective Kuranishi (co)homology KH\u2217ef , KHec\nhomology that has the advantage that it works for all commutative rings R,\n\u2217\nincluding R = Z, and is isomorphic to H\u2217si , Hcs\n(Y ; R), but has the disadvantage\n\n2\n\n\fof restrictions on the Kuranishi spaces X allowed in chains [X, f , G], which\nlimits its applications in Symplectic Geometry. Similarly, [12, Ch. 5] actually\ndefines five different kinds of Kuranishi (co)bordism, but below we consider\nonly the simplest. The applications to Symplectic Geometry in [12, Ch. 6] are\nomitted.\nKuranishi (co)homology is intended primarily as a tool for use in areas of\nSymplectic Geometry involving J-holomorphic curves, and will be applied in\nthe sequels [2, 13\u201315]. Kuranishi structures occur naturally on many moduli\nspaces in Differential Geometry. For example, if (M, \u03c9) is a compact symplectic\nmanifold with almost complex structure J then the moduli space Mg,m (M, J, \u03b2)\nof stable J-holomorphic curves of genus g with m marked points in class\nQ \u03b2 in\nH2 (M ; Z) is a compact Kuranishi space with a strongly smooth map i evi :\nm\nMg,m (M, J, \u03b2) \u2192\ngauge-fixing data G we define\na cycle\n\u0002\nQM . By choosing some\n[Mg,m (M, J, \u03b2),\u0003 i evi , G] in KC\u2217 (M m ; Q) whose homology class [Mg,m (M,\nQ\nJ, \u03b2), i evi , G] in KH\u2217 (M m ; Q) \u223c\n= H\u2217si (M m ; Q) is a Gromov\u2013Witten invariant\nof (M, \u03c9), and is independent of the choice of almost complex structure J.\nIn the conventional definitions of symplectic Gromov\u2013Witten invariants [11,\n16, 17, 19], one must define a virtual cycle for Mg,m (M, J, \u03b2). This is a complicated process, involving many arbitrary choices: first one must perturb the\nmoduli space, morally over Q rather than Z, so that it becomes something like a\nmanifold. Then one must triangulate the perturbed moduli space by simplices to\ndefine a cycle in the singular chains C\u2217si (M m ; Q). The Gromov\u2013Witten invariant\nis the homology class of this virtual cycle. By using Kuranishi (co)homology as a\nsubstitute for singular homology, this process of defining virtual cycles becomes\nmuch simpler and less arbitrary. The moduli space is its own virtual cycle, and\nwe eliminate the need to perturb moduli spaces and triangulate by simplices.\nThe real benefits of the Kuranishi (co)homology approach come not in closed\nGromov\u2013Witten theory, where the moduli spaces are Kuranishi spaces without\nboundary, but in areas such as open Gromov\u2013Witten theory, Lagrangian Floer\ncohomology [10], Contact Homology [8], and Symplectic Field Theory [9], where\nthe moduli spaces are Kuranishi spaces with boundary and corners, and their\nboundaries are identified with fibre products of other moduli spaces.\nIn the conventional approach, one must choose virtual chains for each moduli space, which must be compatible at the boundary with intersection products\nof choices of virtual chains for other moduli spaces. This business of boundary\ncompatibility of virtual chains is horribly complicated and messy, and a large\npart of the 1385 pages of Fukaya, Oh, Ohta and Ono's work on Lagrangian Floer\ncohomology [10] is devoted to dealing with it. Using Kuranishi cohomology, because we do not perturb moduli spaces, choosing virtual chains with boundary\ncompatibility is very easy, and Lagrangian Floer cohomology can be reformulated in a much more economical way, as we will show in [12, \u00a76.6] and [2].\nAn important feature of these theories is that Kuranishi homology and cohomology are very well behaved at the (co)chain level, much better than singular homology, say. For example, Kuranishi cochains KC \u2217 (Y ; R) have a supercommutative, associative cup product \u222a, cap products also work well at\n\n3\n\n\fthe (co)chain level, and there is a well-behaved functor from singular chains\nC\u2217si (Y ; R) to Kuranishi chains KC\u2217 (Y ; R). Because of this, the theories may\nalso have applications in other areas which may not be directly related to Kuranishi spaces, but which need a (co)homology theory of manifolds or orbifolds\nwith good (co)chain-level behaviour. In [14] we will apply Kuranishi (co)chains\nto reformulate the String Topology of Chas and Sullivan [5], which involves\nchains on infinite-dimensional loop spaces. Another possible area is Costello's\napproach to Topological Conformal Field Theories [7], which involves a choice\nof chain complex for homology, applied to moduli spaces of Riemann surfaces.\nAs well as Kuranishi homology and cohomology, in [12, Ch. 5] we also define\nKuranishi bordism KB\u2217 (Y ; R) and Kuranishi cobordism KB \u2217 (Y ; R). These are\nsimpler than Kuranishi (co)homology, being spanned by [X, f ] for X a compact\nKuranishi space without boundary and f : X \u2192 Y strongly smooth, and do\nnot involve gauge-fixing data. In contrast to Kuranishi (co)homology which\nis isomorphic to conventional homology and compactly-supported cohomology,\nthese are new topological invariants, and we show that they are very large -\nfor instance, if Y 6= \u2205 and R \u2297Z Q 6= 0 then KB2k (Y ; R) is infinitely generated\nover R for all k \u2208 Z.\nIn [12, \u00a76.2] we define new Gromov\u2013Witten type invariants [Mg,m (M, J,\nQ\n\u03b2), i evi ] in Kuranishi bordism KB\u2217 (M m ; Z). Since these are defined in\ngroups over Z, not Q, the author expects that Kuranishi (co)bordism will be useful in studying integrality properties of Gromov\u2013Witten invariants. In [12, \u00a76.3]\nwe outline an approach to proving the Gopakumar\u2013Vafa Integrality Conjecture\nfor Gromov\u2013Witten invariants of Calabi\u2013Yau 3-folds, which the author hopes\nto take further in [15].\nAcknowledgements.

Manifolds with g-corners are new, as far as\n\n4\n\n\fthe author knows. The precise definitions of these classes of manifolds are given\nin [12, \u00a72.1]. Here are the basic ideas:\n\u2022 An n-dimensional manifold without boundary is locally modelled on open\nsets in Rn .\n\u2022 An n-dimensional manifold with boundary is locally modelled on open sets\nin Rn or [0, \u221e) \u00d7 Rn\u22121 .\n\u2022 An n-dimensional manifold with corners is locally modelled on open sets\nin [0, \u221e)k \u00d7 Rn\u2212k for k = 0, . . . , n.\n\u2022 A polyhedral cone C in Rn is a subset of the form\n\b\nC = (x1 , . . . , xn ) \u2208 Rn : ai1 x1 + * * * + ain xn > 0, i = 1, . . . , k ,\nwhere aij \u2208 R for i = 1, . . . , k and j = 1, . . . , n.\nAn n-dimensional manifold with g-corners is roughly speaking locally\nmodelled on open sets in polyhedral cones C in Rn with nonempty interior\nC \u25e6 . Since [0, \u221e)k \u00d7 Rn\u2212k is a polyhedral cone C with C \u25e6 6= \u2205, manifolds\nwith corners are examples of manifolds with g-corners. In fact the subsets\nin Rn used as local models for manifolds with g-corners are more general than polyhedral cones, but this extra generality is only needed for\ntechnical reasons in the proof of Theorem 3.3.\nHere are some examples. The line R is a 1-manifold without boundary; the\ninterval [0, 1] is a 1-manifold with boundary; the square [0, 1]2 is a 2-manifold\nwith corners; and the octahedron\n\b\nO = (x1 , x2 , x3 ) \u2208 R3 : |x1 | + |x2 | + |x3 | 6 1\nin R3 is a 3-manifold with g-corners. It is not a manifold with corners, since four\n2-dimensional faces of O meet at the vertex (1, 0, 0), but three 2-dimensional\nfaces of [0, \u221e)3 meet at the vertex (0, 0, 0), so O near (1, 0, 0) is not locally\nmodelled on [0, \u221e)3 near (0, 0, 0).\nManifolds X with boundary, corners, or g-corners have a well-behaved notion\n2\n2\nof boundary\ntook\n\u0001 \u2202X. To motivate the definition,\n\u0001 consider [0, \u221e) \u0001in R . If we\n2\n\u2202 [0, \u221e) \u0001 to be the subset [0, \u221e) \u00d7 {0} \u222a {0} \u00d7 [0, \u221e) of [0, \u221e)2 , then\n\u2202 [0, \u221e)2 \u0001 would not be a manifold with corners near (0, 0). Instead, we take\n\u2202 [0, \u221e)2 to be the disjoint union of the two boundary strata [0, \u221e) \u00d7\n\u0001 {0} and\n2\n{0} \u00d7 [0, \u221e). This is a manifold with boundary,\n\u0001 but now \u2202 [0, \u221e) is not a\nsubset of [0, \u221e)2 , since two points in \u2202 [0, \u221e)2 correspond to (0, 0) in [0, \u221e)2 .\nWe define the boundary \u2202X of an n-manifold X with (g-)corners to be the\nset of pairs (p, B), where p \u2208 X and B is a local choice of connected (n\u2212 1)dimensional boundary stratum of X containing p. Thus, if p lies in a codimension k corner of X locally modelled on [0, \u221e)k \u00d7 Rn\u2212k then p is represented by\nk distinct points (p, Bi ) in \u2202X for i = 1, . . . , k. Then \u2202X is an (n\u22121)-manifold\nwith (g-)corners. Note that \u2202X is not a subset of X, but has a natural immersion \u03b9 : \u2202X \u2192 X mapping (p, B) 7\u2192 p. Often we suppress \u03b9, and talk of\nrestricting data on X to \u2202X, when really we mean the pullback by \u03b9.\n5\n\n\fIf X is a n-manifold with (g-)corners then \u2202 2 X is an (n\u22122)-manifold with\n(g-)corners. Points of \u2202 2 X may be written (p, B1 , B2 ), where p \u2208 X and B1 , B2\nare distinct local boundary components of X containing p. There is a natural,\nfree involution \u03c3 : \u2202 2 X \u2192 \u2202 2 X mapping \u03c3 : (p, B1 , B2 ) 7\u2192 (p, B2 , B1 ), which is\norientation-reversing if X is oriented. This involution is important in questions\nto do with extending data defined on \u2202X to X. For example, if f : \u2202X \u2192 R is a\nsmooth function, then a necessary condition for there to exist smooth g : X \u2192 R\nwith g|\u2202X \u2261 f is that f |\u2202 2 X is \u03c3-invariant, and if X has corners (not g-corners)\nthen this condition is also sufficient.\nOrbifolds are a generalization of manifold, which allow quotients by finite\ngroups. Again, we define orbifolds without boundary, or with boundary, or with\ncorners, or with g-corners, where orbifolds without boundary are locally modelled on quotients Rn /\u0393 for \u0393 a finite group acting linearly on Rn , and similarly\nfor the other classes. (We do not require \u0393 to act effectively, so we cannot regard \u0393 as a subgroup of GL(n, R).) Orbifolds (then called V -manifolds) were\nintroduced by Satake [18], and a book on orbifolds is Adem et al. [1]. Note\nhowever that the right definition of smooth maps of orbifolds is not that given\nby Satake, but the more complex notion of morphisms of orbifolds in [1, \u00a72.4].\nWhen we do not specify otherwise, by a manifold or orbifold, we always mean\na manifold or orbifold with g-corners, the most general class.\nLet X, Y be manifolds of dimensions m, n. Smooth maps f : X \u2192 Y are\ncontinuous maps which are locally modelled on smooth maps from Rm \u2192 Rn .\nA smooth map f induces a morphism of vector bundles df : T X \u2192 f \u2217 (T Y )\non X, where T X, T Y are the tangent bundles of X and Y . For manifolds\nX, Y without boundary, we call a smooth map f : X \u2192 Y a submersion if\ndf : T X \u2192 f \u2217 (T Y ) is a surjective morphism of vector bundles. If X, Y have\nboundary or (g-)corners, the definition of submersions f : X \u2192 Y in [12, \u00a72.1] is\nmore complicated, involving conditions over \u2202 k X and \u2202 l Y for all k, l > 0. When\n\u2202Y = \u2205, f is a submersion if d(f |\u2202 k X ) : T (\u2202 k X) \u2192 f |\u2217\u2202 k X (T Y ) is surjective for\nall k > 0.\nLet X, X \u2032 , Y be manifolds (in any of the four classes above) and f : X \u2192 Y ,\n\u2032\nf : X \u2032 \u2192 Y be smooth maps, at least one of which is a submersion. Then the\nfibre product X \u00d7f,Y,f \u2032 X \u2032 or X \u00d7Y X \u2032 is\n\b\n(1)\nX \u00d7f,Y,f \u2032 X \u2032 = (p, p\u2032 ) \u2208 X \u00d7 X \u2032 : f (p) = f \u2032 (p\u2032 ) .\nIt turns out [12, Prop. 2.6] that X \u00d7Y X \u2032 is a submanifold of X \u00d7 X \u2032 , and so\nis a manifold (in the same class as X, X \u2032 , Y ). When X, X \u2032 , Y have boundary\nor (g-)corners, the complicated definition of submersion is necessary to make\n\u2032\nX \u00d7Y X \u2032 a submanifold over \u2202 k X, \u2202 k X \u2032 , \u2202 l Y .\nFibre products can be defined for orbifolds [12, \u00a72.2], but there are some\nsubtleties to do with stabilizer groups. To explain this, first consider the case in\nwhich U, U \u2032 , V are manifolds, and \u0393, \u0393\u2032 , \u2206 are finite groups acting on U, U \u2032 , V\nby diffeomorphisms so that U/\u0393, U \u2032 /\u0393\u2032 , V /\u2206 are orbifolds, and \u03c1 : \u0393 \u2192 \u2206,\n\u03c1\u2032 : \u0393\u2032 \u2192 \u2206 are group homomorphisms, and f : U \u2192 V , f \u2032 : U \u2032 \u2192 V are\nsmooth \u03c1- and \u03c1\u2032 -equivariant maps, at least one of which is a submersion. Then\n6\n\n\ff, f \u2032 induce smooth maps of orbifolds f\u2217 : U/\u0393 \u2192 V /\u2206, f\u2217\u2032 : U \u2032 /\u0393\u2032 \u2192 V /\u2206, at\nleast one of which is a submersion.\nIt turns out that the right answer for the orbifold fibre product is\n\u0001\n(U/\u0393) \u00d7f\u2217 ,V /\u2206,f\u2217\u2032 (U \u2032 /\u0393\u2032 ) = (U \u00d7 U \u2032 ) \u00d7f \u00d7f \u2032 ,V \u00d7V,\u03c0 (V \u00d7 \u2206) /(\u0393 \u00d7 \u0393\u2032 ). (2)\nHere \u03c0 : V \u00d7\u2206 \u2192 V \u00d7V is given by \u03c0 : (v, \u03b4) 7\u2192 (v, \u03b4*v), and (U \u00d7U \u2032 )\u00d7f \u00d7f \u2032 ,V \u00d7V,\u03c0\n(V \u00d7 \u2206) is the fibre product of smooth manifolds, and \u0393 \u00d7 \u0393\u2032 acts on \u0001the\nmanifold (U \u00d7 U \u2032 ) \u00d7V \u00d7V (V \u00d7 \u2206) by diffeomorphism\n(\u03b3, \u03b3 \u2032 ) : (u, u\u2032 ), (v, \u03b4) 7\u2192\n\u0001\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032 \u2032\n\u2032 \u2032 \u22121\n(\u03b3 * u, \u03b3 * u ), (\u03c1(\u03b3) * v, \u03c1 (\u03b3 )\u03b4\u03c1 (\u03b3 ) ) , so that the quotient is an orbifold.\nNow (2) coincides with (1) for X = U/\u0393, X \u2032 = U \u2032 /\u0393\u2032 , Y = V /\u2206 only if one of\n\u03c1 : \u0393 \u2192 \u2206, \u03c1\u2032 , \u0393\u2032 \u2192 \u2206 are surjective; otherwise the projection from (2) to (1) is\na finite surjective map, but not necessarily injective.\nThis motivates the definition of fibre products of orbifolds. Let X, X \u2032 , Y be\norbifolds, and f : X \u2192 Y , f \u2032 : X \u2032 \u2192 Y be smooth maps, at least one of which is\na submersion. Then for p \u2208 X and p\u2032 \u2208 X \u2032 with f (p) = q = f (p\u2032 ) in Y we have\nmorphisms of stabilizer groups f\u2217 : Stab(p) \u2192 Stab(q), f\u2217\u2032 : Stab(p\u2032 ) \u2192 Stab(q).\nThus we can form the double coset space\nf\u2217 (Stab(p))\\ Stab(q)/f\u2217\u2032 (Stab(p\u2032 ))\n\b\n= {f\u2217 (\u03b3)\u03b4f\u2217 (\u03b3 \u2032 ) : \u03b3 \u2208 Stab(p), \u03b3 \u2032 \u2208 Stab(p\u2032 )} : \u03b4 \u2208 Stab(q) .\nAs a set, we define\n\b\nX \u00d7f,Y,f \u2032 X \u2032 = (p, p\u2032 , \u2206) : p \u2208 X, p\u2032 \u2208 X \u2032 , f (p) = f \u2032 (p\u2032 ),\n\n\u2206 \u2208 f\u2217 (Stab(p))\\ Stab(f (p))/f\u2217\u2032 (Stab(p\u2032 )) .\n\n(3)\n\nWe give this an orbifold structure in a natural way, such that if (U, \u0393, \u03c6),\n(U \u2032 , \u0393\u2032 , \u03c6\u2032 ), (V \u2032 , \u2206\u2032 , \u03c8 \u2032 ) are orbifold charts on X, X \u2032 , Y with f (Im \u03c6), f \u2032 (Im \u03c6\u2032 ) \u2286\nIm \u03c8 then we use (2) to define an orbifold chart on X \u00d7Y X \u2032 .\n\n2.2\n\nKuranishi structures on topological spaces\n\nLet X be a paracompact Hausdorff topological space throughout.\nDefinition 2.1. A Kuranishi neighbourhood (Vp , Ep , sp , \u03c8p ) of p \u2208 X satisfies:\n(i) Vp is an orbifold, which may or may not have boundary or (g-)corners;\n(ii) Ep \u2192 Vp is an orbifold vector bundle over Vp , the obstruction bundle;\n(iii) sp : Vp \u2192 Ep is a smooth section, the Kuranishi map; and\n(iv) \u03c8p is a homeomorphism from sp\u22121 (0) to an open neighbourhood of p in X,\nwhere s\u22121\np (0) is the subset of Vp where the section sp is zero.\nDefinition 2.2. Let (Vp , Ep , sp , \u03c8p ), (\u1e7cp , \u1ebcp , s\u0303p , \u03c8\u0303p ) be two Kuranishi neighbourhoods of p \u2208 X. We call (\u03b1, \u03b1\u0302) : (Vp , . . . , \u03c8p ) \u2192 (\u1e7cp , . . . , \u03c8\u0303p ) an isomorphism if \u03b1 : Vp \u2192 \u1e7cp is a diffeomorphism and \u03b1\u0302 : Ep \u2192 \u03b1\u2217 (\u1ebcp ) an isomorphism\nof orbibundles, such that s\u0303p \u25e6 \u03b1 \u2261 \u03b1\u0302 \u25e6 sp and \u03c8\u0303p \u25e6 \u03b1 \u2261 \u03c8p .\n7\n\n\fWe call (Vp , . . . , \u03c8p ), (\u1e7cp , . . . , \u03c8\u0303p ) equivalent if there exist open neighbourhoods Up \u2286 Vp , \u0168p \u2286 \u1e7cp of \u03c8p\u22121 (p), \u03c8\u0303p\u22121 (p) such that (Up , Ep |Up , sp |Up , \u03c8p |Up )\nand (\u0168p , \u1ebcp |\u0168p , s\u0303p |\u0168p , \u03c8\u0303p |\u0168p ) are isomorphic.\nDefinition 2.3. Let (Vp , Ep , sp , \u03c8p ) and (Vq , Eq , sq , \u03c8q ) be Kuranishi neighbourhoods of p \u2208 X and q \u2208 \u03c8p (s\u22121\np (0)) respectively. We call a pair (\u03c6pq , \u03c6\u0302pq )\na coordinate change from (Vq , . . . , \u03c8q ) to (Vp , . . . , \u03c8p ) if:\n(a) \u03c6pq : Vq \u2192 Vp is a smooth embedding of orbifolds;\n(b) \u03c6\u0302pq : Eq \u2192 \u03c6\u2217pq (Ep ) is an embedding of orbibundles over Vq ;\n(c) \u03c6\u0302pq \u25e6 sq \u2261 sp \u25e6 \u03c6pq ;\n(d) \u03c8q \u2261 \u03c8p \u25e6 \u03c6pq ; and\n(e) Choose an open neighbourhood Wpq of \u03c6pq (Vq ) in Vp , and an orbifold\nvector subbundle Fpq of Ep |Wpq with \u03c6\u2217pq (Fpq ) = \u03c6\u0302pq (Eq ), as orbifold\nvector subbundles of \u03c6\u2217pq (Ep ) over Vq . Write \u015dp : Wpq \u2192 Ep /Fpq for the\nprojection of sp |Wpq to the quotient bundle Ep /Fpq . Now sp |\u03c6pq (Vq ) lies in\nFpq by (c), so \u015dp |\u03c6pq (Vq ) \u2261 0. Thus there is a well-defined derivative\nd\u015dp : N\u03c6pq (Vq ) Vp \u2192 (Ep /Fpq )|\u03c6pq (Vq ) ,\nwhere N\u03c6pq (Vq ) Vp is the normal orbifold vector bundle of \u03c6pq (Vq ) in Vp .\nPulling back to Vq using \u03c6pq , and noting that \u03c6\u2217pq (Fpq ) = \u03c6\u0302pq (Eq ), gives\na morphism of orbifold vector bundles over Vq :\nd\u015dp :\n\n\u03c6\u2217pq (T Vp )\n\u03c6\u2217pq (Ep )\n\u2212\u2192\n.\n(d\u03c6pq )(T Vq )\n\u03c6\u0302pq (Eq )\n\n(4)\n\nWe require that (4) should be an isomorphism over s\u22121\nq (0).\nHere Definition 2.3(e) replaces the notion in [11, Def. 5.6], [10, Def. A1.14]\nthat a Kuranishi structure has a tangent bundle.\nDefinition 2.4. A germ of Kuranishi neighbourhoods at p \u2208 X is an equivalence class of Kuranishi neighbourhoods (Vp , Ep , sp , \u03c8p ) of p, using the notion of\nequivalence in Definition 2.2. Suppose (Vp , Ep , sp , \u03c8p ) lies in such a germ. Then\nfor any open neighbourhood Up of \u03c8p\u22121 (p) in Vp , (Up , Ep |Up , sp |Up , \u03c8p |Up ) also\nlies in the germ. As a shorthand, we say that some condition on the germ holds\nfor sufficiently small (Vp , . . . , \u03c8p ) if whenever (Vp , . . . , \u03c8p ) lies in the germ, the\ncondition holds for (Up , . . . , \u03c8p |Up ) for all sufficiently small Up as above.\nA Kuranishi structure \u03ba on X assigns a germ of Kuranishi neighbourhoods\nfor each p \u2208 X and a germ of coordinate changes between them in the following\nsense: for each p \u2208 X, for all sufficiently small (Vp , . . . , \u03c8p ) in the germ at p, for\nall q \u2208 Im \u03c8p , and for all sufficiently small (Vq , . . . , \u03c8q ) in the germ at q, we are\ngiven a coordinate change (\u03c6pq , \u03c6\u0302pq ) from (Vq , . . . , \u03c8q ) to (Vp , . . . , \u03c8p ). These\ncoordinate changes should be compatible with equivalence in the germs at p, q\nin the obvious way, and satisfy:\n8\n\n\f(i) dim Vp \u2212 rank Ep is independent of p; and\n(ii) if q \u2208 Im \u03c8p and r \u2208 Im \u03c8q then \u03c6pq \u25e6 \u03c6qr = \u03c6pr and \u03c6\u0302pq \u25e6 \u03c6\u0302qr = \u03c6\u0302pr .\nWe call vdim X = dim Vp \u2212 rank Ep the virtual dimension of the Kuranishi\nstructure. A Kuranishi space (X, \u03ba) is a topological space X with a Kuranishi\nstructure \u03ba. Usually we refer to X as the Kuranishi space, suppressing \u03ba.\nLoosely speaking, the above definitions mean that a Kuranishi space is locally modelled on the zeroes of a smooth section of an orbifold vector bundle\nover an orbifold. Moduli spaces of J-holomorphic curves in Symplectic Geometry can be given Kuranishi structures in a natural way, as in [10, 11].\n\n2.3\n\nStrongly smooth maps and strong submersions\n\nIn [12, Def. 2.24] we define strongly smooth maps f : X \u2192 Y , for Y an orbifold.\nDefinition 2.5. Let X be a Kuranishi space, and Y a smooth orbifold. A\nstrongly smooth map f : X \u2192 Y consists of, for all p \u2208 X and all sufficiently\nsmall (Vp , Ep , sp , \u03c8p ) in the germ of Kuranishi neighbourhoods at p, a choice\nof smooth map fp : Vp \u2192 Y , such that for all q \u2208 Im \u03c8p and sufficiently small\n(Vq , . . . , \u03c8q ) in the germ at q with coordinate change (\u03c6pq , \u03c6\u0302pq ) from (Vq , . . . , \u03c8q )\nto (Vp , . . . , \u03c8p ) in the germ of coordinate changes, we have fp \u25e6 \u03c6pq = fq . Then\nf induces a continuous map f : X \u2192 Y in the obvious way.\nWe call f a strong submersion if all the fp are submersions, that is, the maps\ndfp : T Vp \u2192 fp\u2217 (T Y ) are surjective, and also when Vp has boundary or corners,\nfp |\u2202Vp : \u2202Vp \u2192 Y is a submersion, and the restriction of fp to each codimension\nk corner is a submersion for all k.\nThere is also [12, Def. 2.25] a definition of strongly smooth maps f : X \u2192 Y\nfor X, Y Kuranishi spaces, which we will not give. A strong diffeomorphism\nf : X \u2192 Y is a strongly smooth map with a strongly smooth inverse. It is the\nnatural notion of isomorphism of Kuranishi spaces.\n\n2.4\n\nBoundaries of Kuranishi spaces\n\nWe define the boundary \u2202X of a Kuranishi space X, which is itself a Kuranishi\nspace of dimension vdim X \u2212 1.\nDefinition 2.6. Let X be a Kuranishi space. We shall define a Kuranishi\nspace \u2202X called the boundary of X. The points of \u2202X are equivalence classes\n[p, (Vp , . . . , \u03c8p ), B] of triples (p, (Vp , . . . , \u03c8p ), B), where p \u2208 X, (Vp , . . . , \u03c8p ) lies\nin the germ of Kuranishi neighbourhoods at p, and B is a local boundary component of Vp at \u03c8p\u22121 (p). Two triples (p, (Vp , . . . , \u03c8p ), B), (q, (\u1e7cq , . . . , \u03c8\u0303q ), C) are\nequivalent if p = q, and the Kuranishi neighbourhoods (Vp , . . . , \u03c8p ), (\u1e7cq , . . . , \u03c8\u0303q )\nare equivalent so that we are given an isomorphism (\u03b1, \u03b1\u0302) : (Up , . . . , \u03c8p |Up ) \u2192\n(\u0168q , . . . , \u03c8\u0303q |\u0168q ) for open \u03c8p\u22121 (p) \u2208 Up \u2286 Vp and \u03c8\u0303q\u22121 (q) \u2208 \u0168q \u2286 \u1e7cq , and\n\u03b1\u2217 (B) = C near \u03c8\u0303q\u22121 (q).\n9\n\n\fWe can define a unique natural topology and Kuranishi structure on \u2202X,\nsuch that (\u2202Vp , Ep |\u2202Vp , sp |\u2202Vp , \u03c8p\u2032 ) is a Kuranishi neighbourhood on \u2202X for each\nKuranishi neighbourhood (Vp , . . . , \u03c8p ) on X, where \u03c8p\u2032 : (sp |\u2202Vp )\u22121 (0) \u2192 \u2202X is\ngiven by \u03c8p\u2032 : (q, B) 7\u2192 [\u03c8p (q), (Vp , . . . \u03c8p ), B] for (q, B) \u2208 \u2202Vp with sp (q) = 0.\nThen vdim(\u2202X) = vdim X \u2212 1, and \u2202X is compact if X is compact.\nIn \u00a72.1 we explained that if X is a manifold with (g-)corners then there is a\nnatural involution \u03c3 : \u2202 2 X \u2192 \u2202 2 X. The same construction works for orbifolds,\nand for Kuranishi spaces. That is, if X is a Kuranishi space then as in [12, \u00a72.6]\nthere is a natural strong diffeomorphism \u03c3 : \u2202 2 X \u2192 \u2202 2 X with \u03c3 2 = idX . If X\nis oriented as in \u00a72.6 below then \u03c3 is orientation-reversing.\n\n2.5\n\nFibre products of Kuranishi spaces\n\nWe can define fibre products of Kuranishi spaces [12, Def. 2.28], as for fibre\nproducts of manifolds and orbifolds in \u00a72.1.\nDefinition 2.7. Let X, X \u2032 be Kuranishi spaces, Y an orbifold, and f : X \u2192 Y ,\nf \u2032 : X \u2032 \u2192 Y be strongly smooth maps inducing continuous maps f : X \u2192 Y\nand f \u2032 : X \u2032 \u2192 Y . Suppose at least one of f , f \u2032 is a strong submersion. We shall\ndefine the fibre product X \u00d7Y X \u2032 or X \u00d7f ,Y,f \u2032 X \u2032 , a Kuranishi space. As a set,\nthe underlying topological space X \u00d7Y X \u2032 is given by (3).\nLet p \u2208 X, p\u2032 \u2208 X \u2032 and q \u2208 Y with f (p) = q = f \u2032 (p\u2032 ). Let (Vp , Ep , sp , \u03c8p ),\n\u2032\u2032\n(Vp , Ep\u2032 \u2032 , s\u2032p\u2032 , \u03c8p\u2032 \u2032 ) be sufficiently small Kuranishi neighbourhoods in the germs\nat p, p\u2032 in X, X \u2032 , and fp : Vp \u2192 Y , fp\u2032 \u2032 : Vp\u2032\u2032 \u2192 Y be smooth maps in the germs\nof f , f \u2032 at p, p\u2032 respectively. Define a Kuranishi neighbourhood on X \u00d7Y X \u2032 by\nVp \u00d7fp ,Y,fp\u2032 \u2032 Vp\u2032\u2032 , \u03c0V\u2217p (Ep ) \u2295 \u03c0V\u2217p\u2032\u2032 (Ep\u2032 \u2032 ),\n\u0001\n(sp \u25e6 \u03c0Vp ) \u2295 (s\u2032p\u2032 \u25e6 \u03c0Vp\u2032\u2032 ), (\u03c8p \u25e6 \u03c0Vp ) \u00d7 (\u03c8p\u2032 \u2032 \u25e6 \u03c0Vp\u2032\u2032 ) \u00d7 \u03c7pp\u2032 .\n\n(5)\n\nHere Vp \u00d7fp ,Y,fp\u2032 \u2032 Vp\u2032\u2032 is the fibre product of orbifolds, and \u03c0Vp , \u03c0Vp\u2032\u2032 are the\nprojections from Vp \u00d7Y Vp\u2032\u2032 to Vp , Vp\u2032\u2032 . The final term \u03c7pp\u2032 in (5) maps the\nbiquotient terms in (3) for Vp \u00d7Y Vp\u2032\u2032 to the same terms in (3) for the set X \u00d7Y\nX \u2032 . Coordinate changes between Kuranishi neighbourhoods in X, X \u2032 induce\ncoordinate changes between neighbourhoods (5). So the systems of germs of\nKuranishi neighbourhoods and coordinate changes on X, X \u2032 induce such systems\non X \u00d7Y X \u2032 . This gives a Kuranishi structure on X \u00d7Y X \u2032 , making it into a\nKuranishi space. Clearly vdim(X \u00d7Y X \u2032 ) = vdim X + vdim X \u2032 \u2212 dim Y , and\nX \u00d7Y X \u2032 is compact if X, X \u2032 are compact.\n\n2.6\n\nOrientations and orientation conventions\n\nIn [12, \u00a72.7] we define orientations on Kuranishi spaces. Our definition is basically equivalent to Fukaya et al. [10, Def. A1.17], noting that our Kuranishi\nspaces correspond to their Kuranishi spaces with a tangent bundle.\nDefinition 2.8. Let X be a Kuranishi space. An orientation on X assigns, for\nall p \u2208 X and all sufficiently small Kuranishi neighbourhoods (Vp , Ep , sp , \u03c8p ) in\n10\n\n\fthe germ at p, orientations on the fibres of the orbibundle T Vp \u2295 Ep varying\ncontinuously over Vp . These must be compatible with coordinate changes, in\nthe following sense. Let q \u2208 Im \u03c8p , (Vq , . . . , \u03c8q ) be sufficiently small in the germ\nat q, and (\u03c6pq , \u03c6\u0302pq ) be the coordinate change from (Vq , . . . , \u03c8q ) to (Vp , . . . , \u03c8p )\nin the germ. Define d\u015dp near sq\u22121 (0) \u2286 Vq as in (4).\nLocally on Vq , choose any orientation for the fibres of \u03c6\u2217pq (T Vp )/(d\u03c6pq )(T Vq ),\nand let \u03c6\u2217pq (Ep )/\u03c6\u0302pq (Eq ) have the orientation induced from this by the isomorphism d\u015dp in (4). These induce an orientation on\n\n\u03c6\u2217\npq (T Vp )\n(d\u03c6pq )(T Vq )\n\n\u03c6\u2217 (Ep )\n\n\u2295 \u03c6\u0302pq (E ) , which is\npq\n\nq\n\nindependent of the choice for \u03c6\u2217pq (T Vp )/(d\u03c6pq )(T Vq ). Thus, these local choices\n\u03c6\u2217\n\u03c6\u2217\npq (T Vp )\npq (Ep )\n(d\u03c6pq )(T Vq ) \u2295 \u03c6\u0302pq (Eq ) near\nVq near s\u22121\nq (0), we have\n\ninduce a natural orientation on the orbibundle\nWe require that in oriented orbibundles over\n\ns\u22121\nq (0).\n\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u03c6\u2217pq T Vp \u2295 Ep \u223c\n= (\u22121)dim Vq (dim Vp \u2212dim Vq ) T Vq \u2295 Eq \u2295\n\u0002 \u03c6\u2217pq (T Vp )\n\u0003\n\u03c6\u2217\npq (Ep )\n(d\u03c6pq )(T Vq ) \u2295 \u03c6\u0302 (E ) ,\npq\n\n(6)\n\nq\n\nwhere T Vp \u2295 Ep and T Vq \u2295 Eq have the orientations assigned by the orientation\non X. An oriented Kuranishi space is a Kuranishi space with an orientation.\nSuppose X, X \u2032 are oriented Kuranishi spaces, Y is an oriented orbifold, and\nf : X \u2192 Y , f \u2032 : X \u2032 \u2192 Y are strong submersions. Then by \u00a72.4\u2013\u00a72.5 we\nhave Kuranishi spaces \u2202X and X \u00d7Y X \u2032 . These can also be given orientations\nin a natural way. We shall follow the orientation conventions of Fukaya et\nal. [10, \u00a745].\nConvention 2.9. First, our conventions for manifolds:\n(a) Let X be an oriented manifold with boundary \u2202X. Then we define the\norientation on \u2202X such that T X|\u2202X = Rout \u2295 T (\u2202X) is an isomorphism\nof oriented vector spaces, where Rout is oriented by an outward-pointing\nnormal vector to \u2202X.\n(b) Let X, X \u2032 , Y be oriented manifolds, and f : X \u2192 Y , f \u2032 : X \u2032 \u2192 Y be\nsubmersions. Then df : T X \u2192 f \u2217 (T Y ) and df \u2032 : T X \u2032 \u2192 (f \u2032 )\u2217 (T Y ) are\nsurjective maps of vector bundles over X, X \u2032 . Choosing Riemannian metrics on X, X \u2032 and identifying the orthogonal complement of Ker df in T X\nwith the image f \u2217 (T Y ) of df , and similarly for f \u2032 , we have isomorphisms\nof vector bundles over X, X \u2032 :\nTX \u223c\n= (f \u2032 )\u2217 (T Y ) \u2295 Ker df \u2032 .\n= Ker df \u2295 f \u2217 (T Y ) and T X \u2032 \u223c\n\n(7)\n\nDefine orientations on the fibres of Ker df , Ker df \u2032 over X, X \u2032 such that (7)\nare isomorphisms of oriented vector bundles, where T X, T X \u2032 are oriented\nby the orientations on X, X \u2032 , and f \u2217 (T Y ), (f \u2032 )\u2217 (T Y ) by the orientation\non Y . Then we define the orientation on X \u00d7Y X \u2032 so that\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2032\nT (X \u00d7Y X \u2032 ) \u223c\n(Ker df ) \u2295 (f \u25e6 \u03c0X )\u2217 (T Y ) \u2295 \u03c0X\n= \u03c0X\n\u2032 (Ker df )\n\n11\n\n\fis an isomorphism of oriented vector bundles. Here \u03c0X : X \u00d7Y X \u2032 \u2192 X\nand \u03c0X \u2032 : X \u00d7Y X \u2032 \u2192 X \u2032 are the natural projections, and f \u25e6\u03c0X \u2261 f \u2032 \u25e6\u03c0X \u2032 .\nThese extend immediately to orbifolds. They also extend to the Kuranishi\nspace versions in Definitions 2.6 and 2.7; for Definition 2.7 they are described\nin [10, Conv. 45.1(4)]. An algorithm to deduce Kuranishi space orientation\nconventions from manifold ones is described in [12, \u00a72.7].\nIf X is an oriented Kuranishi space, we often write \u2212X for the same Kuranishi space with the opposite orientation. Here is [12, Prop. 2.31], largely taken\nfrom Fukaya et al. [10, Lem. 45.3].\nProposition 2.10. Let X1 , X2 , . . . be oriented Kuranishi spaces, Y, Y1 , . . . be\noriented orbifolds, and f 1 : X1 \u2192 Y, . . . be strongly smooth maps, with at least\none strong submersion in each fibre product below. Then the following hold, in\noriented Kuranishi spaces:\n(a) If \u2202Y = \u2205, for f 1 : X1 \u2192 Y and f 2 : X2 \u2192 Y we have\n\u2202(X1 \u00d7Y X2 ) = (\u2202X1 ) \u00d7Y X2 \u2210 (\u22121)vdim X1 +dim Y X1 \u00d7Y (\u2202X2 )\nand\n\nX1 \u00d7Y X2 = (\u22121)(vdim X1 \u2212dim Y )(vdim X2 \u2212dim Y ) X2 \u00d7Y X1 .\n\n(8)\n\n(b) For f 1 : X1 \u2192 Y1 , f 2 : X2 \u2192 Y1 \u00d7 Y2 and f 3 : X3 \u2192 Y2 , we have\n(X1 \u00d7Y1 X2 ) \u00d7Y2 X3 = X1 \u00d7Y1 (X2 \u00d7Y2 X3 ).\n\n(9)\n\n(c) For f 1 : X1 \u2192 Y1 \u00d7 Y2 , f 2 : X2 \u2192 Y1 and f 3 : X3 \u2192 Y2 , we have\nX1 \u00d7Y1 \u00d7Y2 (X2 \u00d7 X3 ) = (\u22121)dim Y2 (dim Y1 +vdim X2 ) (X1 \u00d7Y1 X2 ) \u00d7Y2 X3 . (10)\n\n2.7\n\nCoorientations\n\nTo define Kuranishi cohomology in \u00a74 we we will also need a notion of relative\norientation for (strong) submersions. We call this a coorientation, [12, \u00a72.8].\nDefinition 2.11. Let X, Y be orbifolds, and f : X \u2192 Y a submersion. A\ncoorientation for (X, f ) is a choice of orientations on the fibres of the vector\nbundle Ker df over X which vary continuously over X. Here df : T X \u2192 f \u2217 (T Y )\nis the derivative of f , a morphism of vector bundles, which is surjective as f is\na submersion. Thus Ker df is a vector bundle over X, of rank dim X \u2212 dim Y .\nNow let X be a Kuranishi space, Y an orbifold, and f : X \u2192 Y a strong\nsubmersion. A coorientation for (X, f ) assigns, for all p \u2208 X and all sufficiently\nsmall Kuranishi neighbourhoods (Vp , Ep , sp , \u03c8p ) in the germ at p with submersion fp : Vp \u2192 Y representing f , orientations on the fibres of the orbibundle\nKer dfp \u2295 Ep varying continuously over Vp , where dfp : T Vp \u2192 fp\u2217 (T Y ) is the\n(surjective) derivative of fp .\n12\n\n\fThese must be compatible with coordinate changes, in the following sense.\nLet q \u2208 Im \u03c8p , (Vq , . . . , \u03c8q ) be sufficiently small in the germ at q, let fq : Vq \u2192\nY represent f , and (\u03c6pq , \u03c6\u0302pq ) be the coordinate change from (Vq , . . . , \u03c8q ) to\n(Vp , . . . , \u03c8p ) in the germ. Then we require that in oriented orbibundles over Vq\nnear s\u22121\nq (0), we have\n\u0003\n\u0003\n\u0002\n\u0002\n\u03c6\u2217pq Ker dfp \u2295 Ep \u223c\n= (\u22121)dim Vq (dim Vp \u2212dim Vq ) Ker dfq \u2295 Eq \u2295\n(11)\n\u0002 \u03c6\u2217pq (T Vp )\n\u0003\n\u03c6\u2217\npq (Ep )\n(d\u03c6pq )(T Vq ) \u2295 \u03c6\u0302 (E ) ,\npq\n\nby analogy with (6), where\n\n\u03c6\u2217\npq (T Vp )\n(d\u03c6pq )(T Vq )\n\n\u03c6\u2217\npq (Ep )\n\n\u2295 \u03c6\u0302\n\npq (Eq )\n\nq\n\nis oriented as in Definition 2.8.\n\nSuppose now that Y is oriented. Then an orientation on X is equivalent to\na coorientation for (X, f ), since for all p, (Vp , . . . , \u03c8p ), fp as above, the isomorphism T Vp \u223c\n= fp\u2217 (T Y ) \u2295 Ker dfp induces isomorphisms of orbibundles over Vp :\n\u0001\n\u0001\n(12)\nT Vp \u2295 Ep \u223c\n= fp\u2217 (T Y ) \u2295 Ker dfp \u2295 Ep .\nThere is a 1-1 correspondence between orientations on X and coorientations for\n(X, f ) such that (12) holds in oriented orbibundles, where T Vp \u2295 Ep is oriented\nby the orientation on X, and Ker dfp \u2295 Ep by the coorientation for (X, f ), and\nfp\u2217 (T Y ) by the orientation on Y . Taking the direct sum of fp\u2217 (T Y ) with (11)\nand using (12) yields (6), so this is compatible with coordinate changes.\nIn [12, Conv. 2.33] we give our conventions for coorientations of boundaries\nand fibre products. These correspond to Convention 2.9 under the 1-1 correspondence between orientations on X and coorientations for (X, f ) above when\nY is oriented. So the analogue of Proposition 2.10 holds for coorientations. In\nparticular, for strong submersions f a : Xa \u2192 Y with (Xa , f a ) cooriented for\na = 1, 2, 3, taking \u2202Y = \u2205 in (13), we have\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u2202(X1 \u00d7Y X2 ), \u03c0 Y \u223c\n= (\u2202X1 ) \u00d7Y X2 , \u03c0 Y \u2210\n(13)\n\u0001\n(\u22121)vdim X1 +dim Y X1 \u00d7Y (\u2202X2 ), \u03c0 Y ,\n\u0001\n\u0001\nX1 \u00d7 Y X2 , \u03c0 Y \u223c\n= (\u22121)(vdim X1 \u2212dim Y )(vdim X2 \u2212dim Y ) X2 \u00d7Y X1 , \u03c0Y , (14)\n\u0001\n\u0001\n(15)\n(X1 \u00d7Y X2 ) \u00d7Y X3 , \u03c0Y \u223c\n= X1 \u00d7Y (X2 \u00d7Y X3 ), \u03c0 Y .\n\nSimilarly, if X1 is oriented, f 1 : X1 \u2192 Y is strongly smooth, f 2 : X2 \u2192 Y is a\ncooriented strong submersion, and \u2202Y = \u2205 then\n\u0001\n\u0001\n(16)\n\u2202(X1 \u00d7Y X2 ) \u223c\n= (\u2202X1 ) \u00d7Y X2 \u2210 (\u22121)vdim X1 +dim Y X1 \u00d7Y (\u2202X2 )\nin oriented Kuranishi spaces.\n\n3\n\nKuranishi homology\n\nKuranishi homology [12, \u00a74] is a homology theory of orbifolds Y in which the\nchains are isomorphism classes [X, f , G], where X is a compact, oriented Kuranishi space, f : X \u2192 Y is strongly smooth, and G is some extra data called\ngauge-fixing data. It is isomorphic to singular homology H\u2217si (Y ; R).\n13\n\n\f3.1\n\nGauge-fixing data\n\nLet X be a compact Kuranishi space, Y an orbifold, and f : X \u2192 Y a\nstrongly smooth map. A key ingredient in the definition of Kuranishi homology\nin [12]\nis the idea of gauge fixing data G for (X, f ) studied in [12, \u00a76]. Define\n`\u221e\nP = k=0 Rk /Sk , where the symmetric group Sk acts on Rk by permuting the\n`\ncoordinates x1 , . . . , xk . For n = 0, 1, 2, . . ., define Pn \u2282 P by Pn = nk=0 Rk /Sk .\nGauge-fixing data G for (X, f ) consists of a cover of X by Kuranishi neighbourhoods (V i , E i , si , \u03c8 i ) for i in a finite indexing set I, together with smooth\nmaps f i : V i \u2192 Y representing f and maps Gi : E i \u2192 Pn \u2282 P for some n \u226b 0,\nand continuous partitions of unity \u03b7i : X \u2192 [0, 1] and \u03b7ij : V j \u2192 [0, 1], satisfying many conditions. One important condition, responsible for Theorem 3.1(b)\nbelow, is that each Gi : E i \u2192 P should be a finite map, that is, (Gi )\u22121 (p) is\nfinitely many points for all p \u2208 P .\nUsers of Kuranishi homology do not need to know exactly what gauge-fixing\ndata is, so we will not define it. Here are the important properties of gauge-fixing\ndata, which are proved in [12, \u00a73].\nTheorem 3.1. Consider pairs (X, f ), where X is a compact Kuranishi space,\nY an orbifold, and f : X \u2192 Y a strongly smooth map. In [12, \u00a73.1] we define\ngauge-fixing data G for such pairs (X, f ), with the following properties:\n(a) Every pair (X, f ) admits a (nonunique) choice of gauge-fixing data G. If\n\u0393 \u2286 Aut(X, f ) is a finite subgroup then we can choose G to be \u0393-invariant.\n(b) For all pairs (X, f ) and choices of gauge-fixing data G for (X, f ), the\nautomorphism group Aut(X, f , G) of isomorphisms (a, b) : (X, f , G) \u2192\n(X, f , G) is finite.\n(c) Suppose G is gauge-fixing data for (X, f ) and \u0393 is a finite group acting on\n(X, f , G) by isomorphisms. Then we can form the quotient X\u0303 = X/\u0393, a\ncompact Kuranishi space, with projection \u03c0 : X \u2192 X\u0303, and f pushes down\nto f \u0303 : X\u0303 \u2192 Y with f = f \u0303\u25e6 \u03c0. As in [12, \u00a73.4], we can define gauge-fixing\ndata G\u0303 for (X\u0303, f \u0303), which is the natural push down \u03c0\u2217 (G) of G to X\u0303.\n(d) If G is gauge-fixing data for (X, f ), it has a restriction G|\u2202X defined\nin [12, \u00a73.5], which is gauge-fixing data for (\u2202X, f |\u2202X ).\n(e) Let X be a compact, oriented Kuranishi space with corners (not g-corners),\nf : X \u2192 Y be strongly smooth, and \u03c3 : \u2202 2 X \u2192 \u2202 2 X be the natural involution described in \u00a72.4. Suppose H is gauge-fixing data for (\u2202X, f |\u2202X ).\nThen there exists gauge-fixing data G for (X, f ) with G|\u2202X = H if and\nonly if H|\u2202 2 X is invariant under \u03c3. If also \u0393 is a finite subgroup of\nAut(X, f ), and H is invariant under \u0393|\u2202X , then we can choose G to be\n\u0393-invariant.\n(f) Let Y, Z be orbifolds, and h : Y \u2192 Z a smooth map. Suppose X is a\ncompact Kuranishi space, f : X \u2192 Y is strongly smooth, and G is gaugefixing data for (X, f ). Then as in [12, \u00a73.7], we can define gauge-fixing\ndata h\u2217 (G) for (X, h \u25e6 f ). It satisfies (g \u25e6 h)\u2217 (G) = g\u2217 (h\u2217 (G)).\n14\n\n\fIn order to define a working homology theory, perhaps the most important\nproperty is Theorem 3.1(b). In [12, \u00a74.9] we show that if we define na\u0131\u0308ve Ku\u2217\nranishi (co)homology KH\u2217na , KHna\n(Y ; R) as in \u00a73.2 and \u00a74.2 but omitting all\nna\n\u2217\n(co-)gauge-fixing data, then KH\u2217 (Y ; R) = 0 = KHna\n(Y ; R) for all orbifolds\nY and Q-algebras R. For compact Y , we do this by constructing an explicit\n\u2217\ncochain whose boundary is the identity cocycle [Y, idY ] in KCna\n(Y ; R). This\nexplicit cochain involves a cocycle [X, f ] whose automorphism group Aut(X, f )\nis infinite. Including (co-)gauge-fixing data prevents this from happening, as it\nensures that all automorphism groups Aut(X, f , G) are finite.\n\n3.2\n\nKuranishi homology\n\nWe can now define the Kuranishi homology of an orbifold, [12, \u00a74.2].\nDefinition 3.2. Let Y be an orbifold. Consider triples (X, f , G), where X\nis a compact, oriented Kuranishi space, f : X \u2192 Y is strongly smooth, and\nG is gauge-fixing data for (X, f ). Write [X, f, G] for the isomorphism class\nof (X, f , G) under isomorphisms (a, b) : (X, f , G) \u2192 (X\u0303, f \u0303, G\u0303), where a must\nidentify the orientations of X, X\u0303, and b lifts a to the Kuranishi neighbourhoods\n(V i , . . . , \u03c8 i ), (\u1e7c i , . . . , \u03c8\u0303 i ) in G, G\u0303.\nLet R be a Q-algebra, for instance Q, R or C. For each k \u2208 Z, define\nKCk (Y ; R) to be the R-module of finite R-linear combinations of isomorphism\nclasses [X, f , G] for which vdim X = k, with the relations:\n(i) Let [X, f , G] be an isomorphism class, and write \u2212X for X with the\nopposite orientation. Then in KCk (Y ; R) we have\n[X, f , G] + [\u2212X, f , G] = 0.\n(ii) Let [X, f , G] be an isomorphism class. Suppose that X may be written as a disjoint union X = X+ \u2210 X\u2212 of compact, oriented Kuranishi\nspaces, and that for each Kuranishi neighbourhood (V i , . . . , \u03c8 i ) for i \u2208 I\nin G we may write V i = V+i \u2210 V\u2212i for open and closed subsets V\u00b1i of\nV i , such that Im \u03c8 i |V+i \u2286 X+ and Im \u03c8 i |V\u2212i \u2286 X\u2212 . Then we may define\ngauge-fixing data G|X\u00b1 for (X\u00b1 , f |X\u00b1 ), with Kuranishi neighbourhoods\n(V\u00b1i , E i |V\u00b1i , si |V\u00b1i , \u03c8 i |V\u00b1i ) for i \u2208 I with V\u00b1i 6= \u2205. In KCk (Y ; R) we have\n[X, f , G] = [X+ , f |X+ , G|X+ ] + [X\u2212 , f |X\u2212 , G|X\u2212 ].\n(iii) Let [X, f , G] be an isomorphism class, and suppose \u0393 is a finite group\nacting on (X, f , G) by orientation-preserving automorphisms. Then X\u0303 =\nX/\u0393 is a compact, oriented Kuranishi space, with a projection \u03c0 : X \u2192 X\u0303.\nAs in Theorem 3.1(c), f , G push down to a strong submersion \u03c0 \u2217 (f ) =\nf \u0303 : X\u0303 \u2192 Y and gauge-fixing data \u03c0\u2217 (G) = G\u0303 for (X\u0303, f \u0303). Then\n\u0003\n\u0002\n\u0003\n1 \u0002\nX, f , G\nX/\u0393, \u03c0\u2217 (f ), \u03c0\u2217 (G) =\n|\u0393|\n15\n\n\fin KCk (Y ; R). Elements of KCk (Y ; R) will be called Kuranishi chains.\nDefine the boundary operator \u2202 : KCk (Y ; R) \u2192 KCk\u22121 (Y ; R) by\nP\nP\n\u2202 : a\u2208A \u03c1a [Xa , f a , Ga ] 7\u2212\u2192 a\u2208A \u03c1a [\u2202Xa , f a |\u2202Xa , Ga |\u2202Xa ],\nwhere A is a finite indexing set and \u03c1a \u2208 R for a \u2208 A. This is a morphism of\nR-modules. Clearly, \u2202 takes each relation (i)\u2013(iii) in KCk (Y ; R) to the corresponding relation in KCk\u22121 (Y ; R), and so \u2202 is well-defined.\nRecall from \u00a72.1 and \u00a72.4 that if X is an oriented Kuranishi space then there\nis a natural orientation-reversing strong diffeomorphism \u03c3 : \u2202 2 X \u2192 \u2202 2 X, with\n\u03c3 2 = id\u2202 2 X . If [X, f , G] is an isomorphism class then this \u03c3 extends to an\nisomorphism (\u03c3, \u03c4 ) of (\u2202 2 X, f|\u2202 2 X , G|\u2202 2 X ). So part (i) in KCk\u22122 (Y ; R) yields\n[\u2202 2 X, f |\u2202 2 X , G|\u2202 2 X ] + [\u2202 2 X, f|\u2202 2 X , G|\u2202 2 X ] = 0 in KCk\u22122 (Y ; R).\n\n(17)\n\nAs R is a Q-algebra we may multiply (17) by 12 to get [\u2202 2 X, f |\u2202 2 X , G|\u2202 2 X ] = 0.\nTherefore \u2202 \u25e6 \u2202 = 0 as a map KCk (Y ; R) \u2192 KCk\u22122 (Y ; R).\nDefine the Kuranishi homology group KHk (Y ; R) of Y for k \u2208 Z to be\n\u0001\nKer \u2202 : KCk (Y ; R) \u2192 KCk\u22121 (Y ; R)\n\u0001 .\nKHk (Y ; R) =\nIm \u2202 : KCk+1 (Y ; R) \u2192 KCk (Y ; R)\nLet Y, Z be orbifolds, and h : Y \u2192 Z a smooth map. Define the pushforward\nh\u2217 : KCk (Y ; R) \u2192 KCk (Z; R) for k \u2208 Z by\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u0003\n\u0002\nP\nP\nh\u2217 : a\u2208A \u03c1a Xa , f a , Ga 7\u2212\u2192 a\u2208A \u03c1a Xa , h \u25e6 f a , h\u2217 (Ga ) ,\nwith h\u2217 (Ga ) as in Theorem 3.1(f). These take relations (i)\u2013(iii) in KCk (Y ; R)\nto (i)\u2013(iii) in KCk (Z; R), and so are well-defined. They satisfy h\u2217 \u25e6 \u2202 = \u2202 \u25e6 h\u2217 ,\nso they induce morphisms of homology groups h\u2217 : KHk (Y ; R) \u2192 KHk (Z; R).\nPushforward is functorial, that is, (g \u25e6 h)\u2217 = g\u2217 \u25e6 h\u2217 , on chains and homology.\n\n3.3\n\nSingular homology and Kuranishi homology\n\nLet Y be an orbifold, and R a Q-algebra. Then we can define the singular\nhomology groups Hksi (Y ; R), as in Bredon [4, \u00a7IV]. Write Cksi (Y ; R) for the Rmodule spanned by smooth singular k-simplices in Y , which are smooth maps\n\u03c3 : \u2206k \u2192 Y , where \u2206k is the k-simplex\n\b\n\u2206k = (x0 , . . . , xk ) \u2208 Rk+1 : xi > 0, x0 + . . . + xk = 1 .\nsi\nAs in [4, \u00a7IV.1], the boundary operator \u2202 : Cksi (Y ; R) \u2192 Ck\u22121\n(Y ; R) is given by\n\n\u2202:\n\nP\n\na\u2208A \u03c1a\n\n\u03c3a 7\u2212\u2192\n\nP\n\na\u2208A\n\nPk\n\nj\nj=0 (\u22121) \u03c1a (\u03c3a\n\n\u25e6 Fjk ),\n\nwhere Fjk : \u2206k\u22121 \u2192 \u2206k , Fjk : (x0 , . . . , xk\u22121 ) 7\u2192 (x0 , . . . , xj\u22121 , 0, xj , . . . , xk\u22121 )\n\u0001\nfor j = 0, . . . , k. Then \u2202 2 = 0, and H\u2217si (Y ; R) is the homology of Cksi (Y ; R), \u2202 .\n16\n\n\fDefine R-module morphisms Cksi (Y ; R) \u2192 KCk (Y ; R) for k > 0 by\n\u0003\n\u0002\nP\nP\n\u03a0Kh\nsi :\na\u2208A \u03c1a \u03c3a 7\u2212\u2192\na\u2208A \u03c1a \u2206k , \u03c3a , G\u2206k ,\nwhere G\u2206k is an explicit choice of gauge-fixing data for (\u2206k , \u03c3a ) given in [12,\nKh\n\u00a74.3]. These satisfy \u2202 \u25e6 \u03a0Kh\nsi = \u03a0si \u25e6 \u2202, and so induce R-module morphisms\nsi\n\u03a0Kh\nsi : Hk (Y ; R) \u2212\u2192 KHk (Y ; R).\n\n(18)\n\nHere is [12, Cor. 4.10], one of the main results of [12].\nTheorem 3.3. Let Y be an orbifold and R a Q-algebra. Then \u03a0Kh\nsi in (18)\nis an isomorphism, so that KHk (Y ; R) \u223c\n= Hksi (Y ; R), with KHk (Y ; R) = {0}\nwhen k < 0.\nThe proof of Theorem 3.3 in [12, App. A\u2013C] is very long and complex, taking\nup a third of [12]. The problem is to construct an inverse for \u03a0Kh\nsi in (18). This is\nrelated to Fukaya and Ono's construction of virtual cycles for compact, oriented\nKuranishi spaces without boundary in [11, \u00a76], and uses some of the same ideas.\nBut dealing with boundaries and corners of the Kuranishi spaces in Kuranishi\nchains, and the relations in the Kuranishi chain groups KC\u2217 (Y ; R), increases\nthe complexity by an order of magnitude.\nThe basicPidea of the proof is to take a class \u03b1 \u2208 KHk (Y ; R) and represent\nit by cycles a\u2208A \u03c1a [Xa , f a , Ga ] with better and better properties, until evensi\ntually we represent it by a cycle in the image of \u03a0Kh\nsi : Ck (Y ; R) \u2192 KCk (Y ; R),\nso showing that (18) is surjective. Here (somewhat oversimplified) are the\nmain steps: firstly, by 'cutting' the X\na intoPsmall pieces Xac for c \u2208 Ca , we\nP\nshow we can represent \u03b1 by a cycle a\u2208A c\u2208Ca \u03c1a [Xac , f ac , Gac ] such that\n(Xac , f ac , Gac ) is the quotient of a triple (X\u0301ac , f \u0301ac , \u01f4ac ) by a finite group \u0393ac ,\nwhere X\u0301ac has trivial stabilizers.\nP\nThus by Definition 3.2(iii) we can represent \u03b1 by a cycle a,c \u03c1a |\u0393ac |\u22121 [X\u0301ac ,\nf \u0301ac , \u01f4ac ] involving only Kuranishi spaces X\u0301ac with trivial stabilizers. Such\nspaces can be deformed to manifolds with g-corners (by single-valued perturbations,\nnot multisections). So secondly, we show we can represent \u03b1 by a cycle\nP\n\u22121\n[X\u0303ac , f \u0303ac , G\u0303ac ] in which the X\u0303ac are manifolds, and f \u0303ac : X\u0303ac \u2192 Y\na,c \u03c1a |\u0393ac |\nare smooth maps. Then thirdly, we triangulate the X\u0303ac by simplices \u2206k , and so\nprove that we can represent \u03b1 by a cycle in the image of \u03a0Kh\nsi . In this third step\nit is vital to work with manifolds with g-corners, as in \u00a72.1, not just manifolds\nwith corners,\nP since otherwise we would not be able to construct the homology\nbetween a,c \u03c1a |\u0393ac |\u22121 [X\u0303ac , f \u0303ac , G\u0303ac ] and the singular cycle.\nIn the proof we use the fact that R is a Q-algebra in two different ways. When\nwe replace [Xac , f ac , Gac ] by |\u0393ac |\u22121 [X\u0301ac , f \u0301ac , \u01f4ac ] we must have |\u0393ac |\u22121 \u2208 R,\nso\nQ \u2286 R. And when we deform X\u0301ac to manifolds X\u0303ac , to make\nP we need \u22121\n[X\u0303ac , f \u0303ac , G\u0303ac ] a cycle, we should ensure our perturbations are\na,c \u03c1a |\u0393ac |\npreserved by the automorphism groups Aut(X\u0301ac , f \u0301ac , \u01f4ac ). In fact this may not\nbe possible, if Aut(X\u0301ac , f \u0301ac , \u01f4ac ) has fixed points. So instead, we choose one\nperturbation X\u0303ac , and then take the average of the images of this perturbation\n17\n\n\funder Aut(X\u0301ac , f \u0301ac , \u01f4ac ). This requires us to divide by Aut(X\u0301ac , f \u0301ac , \u01f4ac ) ,\nso again we need Q \u2286 R. Also, for this step it is necessary that automorphism\ngroups Aut(X, f , G) should be finite, as in Theorem 3.1(b), and this was the\nreason for introducing gauge-fixing data.\nThe theorem means that in many problems, particularly areas of in Symplectic Geometry involving moduli spaces of J-holomorphic curves, we can use\nKuranishi chains and homology instead of singular chains and homology, which\ncan simplify proofs considerably, and also improve results.\n\n4\n\nKuranishi cohomology\n\nWe now discuss the Poincar\u00e9 dual theory of Kuranishi cohomology KH \u2217 (Y ; R),\n\u2217\nwhich is isomorphic to compactly-supported cohomology Hcs\n(Y ; R). It is defined\n\u2217\nusing a complex of Kuranishi cochains KC (Y ; R) spanned by isomorphism\nclasses [X, f , C] of triples (X, f , C), where X is a compact Kuranishi space,\nf : X \u2192 Y is a cooriented strong submersion, and C is co-gauge-fixing data.\nAs is usual for cohomology, Kuranishi cohomology has an associative, supercommutative cup product \u222a : KH k (Y ; R) \u00d7 KH l (Y ; R) \u2192 KH k+l (Y ; R), and\nthere is also a cap product \u2229 : KHk (Y ; R)\u00d7KH l (Y ; R) \u2192 KHk\u2212l (Y ; R) relating\nKuranishi homology and Kuranishi (co)homology, which makes KH\u2217 (Y ; R) into\na module over KH \u2217 (Y ; R). More unusually, we can define \u222a, \u2229 naturally on Kuranishi (co)chains, and \u222a is associative and supercommutative on KC \u2217 (Y ; R),\nand \u2229 makes KC\u2217 (Y ; R) into a module over KC \u2217 (Y ; R).\n\n4.1\n\nCo-gauge-fixing data\n\nLet X be a compact Kuranishi space, Y an orbifold, and f : X \u2192 Y a strong\nsubmersion. Kuranishi cohomology is based on the idea of co-gauge-fixing data\nC for (X, f ). This is very similar to gauge-fixing data G in \u00a73.1, and consists\nof a finite cover of X by Kuranishi neighbourhoods (V i , E i , si , \u03c8 i ) for i \u2208 I,\nsubmersions f i : V i \u2192 Y representing f and maps C i : E i \u2192 Pn \u2282 P for some\nn \u226b 0, and partitions of unity \u03b7i : X \u2192 [0, 1] and \u03b7ij : V j \u2192 [0, 1].\nHere are the important properties of co-gauge-fixing data, which are proved\nin [12, \u00a73]. Part (g) makes cup products work on Kuranishi cochains, and part\n(h) makes cap products work. It was difficult to find a definition of (co-)gaugefixing data for which properties (a)\u2013(h) all hold at once; a large part of the\ncomplexity of [12, \u00a73] is due to the author's determination to ensure that cup\nproducts should be associative and supercommutative at the cochain level. This\nis not essential for a well-behaved (co)homology theory, but is extremely useful\nin the applications [2, 13, 14].\nTheorem 4.1. Consider pairs (X, f ), where X is a compact Kuranishi space,\nY an orbifold, and f : X \u2192 Y a strong submersion. In [12, \u00a73.1] we define\nco-gauge-fixing data C for such pairs (X, f ). It satisfies the analogues of\nTheorem 3.1(a)\u2013(e), and also:\n\n18\n\n\f(f) Let Y, Z be orbifolds, and h : Y \u2192 Z a smooth, proper map. Suppose X\nis a compact Kuranishi space, f : X \u2192 Z is a strong submersion, and\nC is co-gauge-fixing data for (X, f ). Then the fibre product Y \u00d7h,Z,f\nX is a compact Kuranishi space, and \u03c0 Y : Y \u00d7Z X \u2192 Y is a strong\nsubmersion. As in [12, \u00a73.7], we can define co-gauge-fixing data h\u2217 (C)\nfor (Y \u00d7Z X, \u03c0Y ). It satisfies (g \u25e6 h)\u2217 (C) = h\u2217 (g \u2217 (C)).\n(g) Let X1 , X2 , X3 be compact Kuranishi spaces, Y an orbifold, f i : Xi \u2192\nY be strong submersions for i = 1, 2, 3, and C i be co-gauge-fixing data\nfor (Xi , f i ) for i = 1, 2, 3. Then [12, \u00a73.8] defines co-gauge-fixing data\nC 1 \u00d7Y C 2 for (X1 \u00d7f 1 ,Y,f 2 X2 , \u03c0Y ) from C 1 , C 2 .\nThis construction is symmetric, in that it yields isomorphic co-gaugefixing data for (X1 \u00d7Y X2 , \u03c0 Y ) and (X2 \u00d7Y X1 , \u03c0 Y ) under the natural\nisomorphism X1 \u00d7Y X2 \u223c\n= X2 \u00d7Y X1 . It is also associative, in that\n\u0001 it\nyields isomorphic co-gauge-fixing\ndata\nfor\n(X\n\u00d7\nX\n)\n\u00d7\nX\n,\n\u03c0\nand\n1\nY\n2\nY\n3\nY\n\u0001\nX1 \u00d7Y (X2 \u00d7Y X3 ), \u03c0 Y under (X1 \u00d7Y X2 )\u00d7Y X3 \u223c\n= X1 \u00d7Y (X2 \u00d7Y X3 ).\n\nThese properties also have straightforward generalizations to multiple fibre\nproducts involving more than one orbifold Y, such as (9) and (10).\n(h) Let X1 , X2 be compact Kuranishi spaces, Y an orbifold, f 1 : X1 \u2192 Y be\nstrongly smooth, f 2 : X2 \u2192 Y be a strong submersion, G1 be gauge-fixing\ndata for (X1 , f 1 ), and C 2 be co-gauge-fixing data for (X2 , f 2 ). Then [12,\n\u00a73.8] defines gauge-fixing data G1 \u00d7Y C 2 for (X1 \u00d7f 1 ,Y,f 2 X2 , \u03c0Y ) from\nG1 , C 2 . If also f 3 : X3 \u2192 Y is a strong submersion and C 3 is co-gaugefixing data for (X3 , f 3 ) then the natural isomorphism (X1 \u00d7Y X2 )\u00d7Y X3 \u223c\n=\nX1 \u00d7Y (X2 \u00d7Y X3 ) identifies (G1 \u00d7Y C 2 )\u00d7Y C 3 and G1 \u00d7Y (C 2 \u00d7Y C 3 ).\n\n4.2\n\nKuranishi cohomology\n\nHere is our definition of Kuranishi cohomology [12, \u00a74.4].\nDefinition 4.2. Let Y be an orbifold without boundary. Consider triples\n(X, f , C), where X is a compact Kuranishi space, f : X \u2192 Y is a strong\nsubmersion with (X, f ) cooriented, as in \u00a72.7, and C is co-gauge-fixing data\nfor (X, f ), as in \u00a74.1. Write [X, f , C] for the isomorphism class of (X, f , C)\nunder isomorphisms (a, b) : (X, f , C) \u2192 (X\u0303, f \u0303, C\u0303), where a must identify the\ncoorientations of (X, f ), (X\u0303, f \u0303), and b lifts a to the Kuranishi neighbourhoods\n(V i , . . . , \u03c8 i ), (\u1e7c i , . . . , \u03c8\u0303 i ) in C, C\u0303.\nLet R be a Q-algebra.

Define the Kuranishi cohomology groups\nKH k (Y ; R) of Y for k \u2208 Z to be\n\u0001\nKer d : KC k (Y ; R) \u2192 KC k+1 (Y ; R)\nk\n\u0001 .\nKH (Y ; R) =\nIm d : KC k\u22121 (Y ; R) \u2192 KC k (Y ; R)\nLet Y, Z be orbifolds without boundary, and h : Y \u2192 Z be a smooth, proper\nmap. Define the pullback h\u2217 : KC k (Z; R) \u2192 KC k (Y ; R) by\n\u0002\n\u0003\nP\nP\nh\u2217 : a\u2208A \u03c1a Xa , f a , C a 7\u2212\u2192 a\u2208A \u03c1a [Y \u00d7h,Z,f a Xa , \u03c0 Y , h\u2217 (C a )],\n(20)\nwhere h\u2217 (C a ) is as in Theorem 4.1(f), and the coorientation for (Xa , f a ) pulls\nback to a natural coorientation for (Y \u00d7Z Xa , \u03c0Y ). These h\u2217 : KC k (Z; R) \u2192\nKC k (Y ; R) satisfy h\u2217 \u25e6 d = d \u25e6 h\u2217 , so they induce morphisms of cohomology\ngroups h\u2217 : KH k (Z; R) \u2192 KH k (Y ; R). Pullbacks are functorial, that is, (g \u25e6\nh)\u2217 = h\u2217 \u25e6 g \u2217 , on both cochains and cohomology.\nHere for simplicity we restrict to orbifolds Y without boundary. When \u2202Y 6=\n\u2205, the definition of KH \u2217 (Y ; R) is more complicated [12, \u00a74.5]: if f : X \u2192 Y\nf\nf\nX, where roughly\nis a strong submersion then we must split \u2202X = \u2202+\nX \u2210 \u2202\u2212\nf\nf\nspeaking \u2202+\nX is the component of \u2202X lying over Y \u25e6 , and \u2202\u2212\nX the component\nf\nX \u2192 Y , and\nof \u2202X lying over \u2202Y . Then f |\u2202 f X is a strong submersion f + : \u2202+\n+\n\nf\nX \u2192 \u2202Y is a strong submersion, and \u03b9 : \u2202Y \u2192\nf |\u2202 f X = \u03b9 \u25e6 f \u2212 , where f \u2212 : \u2202\u2212\n\u2212\n\nY is the natural immersion. In (19) we must replace [\u2202Xa , f a |\u2202Xa , C a |\u2202Xa ]\nf\nby [\u2202+a Xa , f a,+ , C a |\u2202 f a Xa ].\n+\n\nIn [12, \u00a74.7] we define cup and cap products.\nDefinition 4.3. Let Y be an orbifold without boundary, and R a Q-algebra.\nDefine the cup product \u222a : KC k (Y ; R) \u00d7 KC l (Y ; R) \u2192 KC k+l (Y ; R) by\n\u0002\n\u0003\n[X, f , C] \u222a [X\u0303, f \u0303, C\u0303] = X \u00d7f ,Y,f \u0303 X\u0303, \u03c0Y , C \u00d7Y C\u0303 ,\nextended R-bilinearly. Here \u03c0 Y : X \u00d7f ,Y,f \u0303 X\u0303 \u2192 Y is the projection from the\nfibre product, which is a strong submersion as both f , f \u0303 are, and C \u00d7Y C\u0303 is\nas in Theorem 4.1(g). Then \u222a takes relations (i)\u2013(iii) in both KC k (Y ; R) and\nKC l (Y ; R) to the same relations in KC k+l (Y ; R). Thus \u222a is well-defined.\nTheorem 4.1(g) and (13)\u2013(15) imply that for \u03b3 \u2208 KC k (Y ; R), \u03b4 \u2208 KC l (Y ; R)\nand \u01eb \u2208 KC m (Y ; R) we have\n\u03b3 \u222a \u03b4 = (\u22121)kl \u03b4 \u222a \u03b3,\nk\n\nd(\u03b3 \u222a \u03b4) = (d\u03b3) \u222a \u03b4 + (\u22121) \u03b3 \u222a (d\u03b4) and (\u03b3 \u222a \u03b4) \u222a \u01eb = \u03b3 \u222a (\u03b4 \u222a \u01eb).\n\n(21)\n(22)\n\nTherefore in the usual way \u222a induces an associative, supercommutative product\n\u222a : KH k (Y ; R) \u00d7 KH l (Y ; R) \u2192 KH k+l (Y ; R) given for \u03b3 \u2208 KC k (Y ; R) and\n\u03b4 \u2208 KC l (Y ; R) with d\u03b3 = d\u03b4 = 0 by\n(\u03b3 + Im dk\u22121 ) \u222a (\u03b4 + Im dl\u22121 ) = (\u03b3 \u222a \u03b4) + Im dk+l\u22121 .\n20\n\n\fNow suppose Y is compact. Then idY : Y \u2192 Y is a (strong) submersion,\nwith a trivial coorientation giving the positive sign to the zero vector bundle\nover Y . One can define natural co-gauge-fixing data C Y for (Y, idY ) such that\n[Y, idY , C Y ] \u2208 KC 0 (Y ; R), with d[Y, idY , C Y ] = 0, and for all [X, f , C] \u2208\nKC k (Y ; R) we have\n[Y, idY , C Y ] \u222a [X, f , C] = [X, f , C] \u222a [Y, idY , C Y ] = [X, f , C].\nThus [Y,\u0002idY , C Y ] is the\nfor \u222a, at the cochain level. Passing to coho\u0003 identity\n0\nmology,\n[Y,\nid\n,\nC\n]\n\u2208\nKH\n(Y\n;\nR) is the identity for \u222a in KH \u2217 (Y ; R). We\nY\nY\n\u0002\n\u0003\ncall [Y, idY , C Y ] the fundamental class of Y .\nDefine the cap product \u2229 : KCk (Y ; R) \u00d7 KC l (Y ; R) \u2192 KCk\u2212l (Y ; R) by\n\u0002\n\u0003\n[X, f , G] \u2229 [X\u0303, f \u0303, C\u0303] = X \u00d7f ,Y,f \u0303 X\u0303, \u03c0Y , G \u00d7Y C\u0303 ,\nextended R-bilinearly, with G \u00d7Y C\u0303 as in Theorem 4.1(h). For \u03b3 \u2208 KCk (Y ; R)\nand \u03b4, \u01eb \u2208 KC \u2217 (Y ; R), the analogue of (22), using Theorem 4.1(h) and (16), is\n\u2202(\u03b3 \u2229 \u03b4) = (\u2202\u03b3) \u2229 \u03b4 + (\u22121)dim Y \u2212k \u03b3 \u222a (d\u03b4),\n\n(\u03b3 \u2229 \u03b4) \u2229 \u01eb = \u03b3 \u2229 (\u03b4 \u222a \u01eb).\n\nIf also Y is compact then \u03b3 \u2229 [Y, idY , C Y ] = \u03b3. Thus \u2229 induces a cap product \u2229 :\nKHk (Y ; R) \u00d7 KH l (Y ; R) \u2192 KHk\u2212l (Y ; R). These products \u2229 make Kuranishi\nchains and homology into modules over Kuranishi cochains and cohomology.\nLet Y, Z be orbifolds without boundary, and h : Y \u2192 Z a smooth, proper\nmap. Then [12, Prop. 3.33] implies that pullbacks h\u2217 and pushforwards h\u2217 are\ncompatible with \u222a, \u2229 on (co)chains, in the sense that if \u03b1 \u2208 KC\u2217 (Y ; R) and\n\u03b2, \u03b3 \u2208 KC \u2217 (Z; R) then\nh\u2217 (\u03b2 \u222a \u03b3) = h\u2217 (\u03b2) \u222a h\u2217 (\u03b3)\n\nand h\u2217 (\u03b1 \u2229 h\u2217 (\u03b2)) = h\u2217 (\u03b1) \u2229 \u03b2.\n\n(23)\n\nSince \u222a, \u2229, h\u2217 , h\u2217 are compatible with d, \u2202, passing to (co)homology shows that\n\u2217\n(23) also holds for \u03b1 \u2208 KH\n(Z; R). If Z is\u0002 compact then\n\u0001 \u2217 (Y ; R) and \u03b2, \u03b3 \u2208 KH\n\u0003\u0001\n\u2217\n0\nY \u0002is, with h [Z,\nid\n,\nC\n]\n=\n[Y,\nid\n,\nC\n]\nin\nKC\n(Y\n; R) and h\u2217 [Z, idZ , C Z ]\nZ\nZ\nY\nY\n\u0003\n= [Y, idY , C Y ] in KH 0 (Y ; R).\nTo summarize: Kuranishi cochains KC \u2217 (Y ; R) form a supercommutative, associative, differential graded R-algebra, and Kuranishi cohomology KH \u2217 (Y ; R)\nis a supercommutative, associative, graded R-algebra. These algebras are with\nidentity if Y is compact without boundary, and without identity otherwise.\nPullbacks h\u2217 induce algebra morphisms on both cochains and cohomology. Kuranishi chains KC\u2217 (Y ; R) are a graded module over KC \u2217 (Y ; R), and Kuranishi\nhomology KH\u2217 (Y ; R) is a graded module over KH \u2217 (Y ; R).\n\n4.3\n\n\u2217\n(Y ; R)\nPoincar\u00e9 duality, and isomorphism with Hcs\n\nSuppose Y is an oriented manifold, of dimension n, without boundary, and not\nnecessarily compact, and R is a commutative ring.

Satake [18, Th. 3] showed that Poincar\u00e9 duality\nisomorphisms (24) exist when Y is an oriented orbifold without boundary and\nR is a Q-algebra.\nLet Y be an orbifold of dimension n without boundary, and R a Q-algebra.\n\u2217\nWe wish to construct an isomorphism \u03a0Kch\n: Hcs\n(Y ; R) \u2192 KH \u2217 (Y ; R) from\ncs\ncompactly-supported cohomology to Kuranishi cohomology.

Then \u2202 \u25e6 \u03a0Kh\nKch = \u03a0Kch \u25e6 d, so they\nKh\nk\ninduce morphisms \u03a0Kch : KH (Y ; R) \u2192 KHn\u2212k (Y ; R) in (co)homology.\nKch\nFor \u03a0Kch\nKh the story is more complicated. To define \u03a0Kh : KCn\u2212k (Y ; R) \u2192\nk\nKC (Y ; R) we cannot simply map [X, f , G] 7\u2192 [X, f , C G ] for some co-gaugefixing data C G constructed from G, since f need only be strongly smooth for\n[X, f , G] \u2208 KCn\u2212k (Y ; R), but f must be a strong submersion for [X, f , C G ] \u2208\nk\nKch\nKC k (Y ; R). Instead, we define \u03a0Kch\nKh : KCn\u2212k (Y ; R) \u2192 KC (Y ; R) by \u03a0Kh :\nY\nY\nY\nY\n[X, f , G] 7\u2192 [X , f , C G ]. Here X is X equipped with an alternative Kuranishi structure, which roughly speaking adds copies of f \u2217 (T Y ) to both the\ntangent bundle and obstruction bundle of X. Also f Y : X Y \u2192 Y is a lift of\nf to X Y , which is a strong submersion, and C YG is co-gauge-fixing data for\nKch\n(X Y , f Y ) constructed in a functorial way from G. Then d \u25e6 \u03a0Kch\nKh = \u03a0Kh \u25e6 \u2202, so\nKch\nk\nthey induce morphisms \u03a0Kh : KHn\u2212k (Y ; R) \u2192 KH (Y ; R) on (co)homology.\nKch\nIn [12, Th. 4.15] we show that these morphisms \u03a0Kh\nKch , \u03a0Kh on Kuranishi\nKch\n(co)homology are inverse. Thus the third morphism \u03a0Kh in (25) is an isomork\n(Y ; R) \u2192 KH k (Y ; R) is an isomorphism.\nphism, so the composition \u03a0Kch\n: Hcs\ncs\nChanging the orientation of Y changes the sign of Pd, \u03a0Kch\nKh , and so does not\nchange \u03a0Kch\ncs . If Y is not orientable we can make a similar argument using\nsi\nhomology groups Hn\u2212k\n(Y ; O \u00d7{\u00b11} R), KHn\u2212k (Y ; O \u00d7{\u00b11} R) twisted by the\nprincipal Z2 -bundle O of orientations on Y . Thus we prove [12, Cor. 4.17]:\nTheorem 4.4. Let Y be an orbifold without boundary, and R a Q-algebra.\nk\nThen there are natural isomorphisms \u03a0Kch\n: Hcs\n(Y ; R) \u2192 KH k (Y ; R) for k >\ncs\nk\n0, and KH (Y ; R) = 0 when k < 0.\nIn [12, \u00a74.5] the theorem is extended to Y with boundary, going via relative homology H\u2217si (Y, \u2202Y ; R), KH\u2217 (Y, \u2202Y ; R). In [12, Th. 4.34] we show that\n22\n\n\f\u2217\nthe isomorphisms \u03a0Kch\n: Hcs\n(Y ; R) \u2192 KH \u2217 (Y ; R) and \u03a0Kh\n: H\u2217si (Y ; R) \u2192\ncs\nsi\nKH\u2217 (Y ; R) in Theorems 3.3 and 4.4 identify the cup and cap products \u222a, \u2229 on\n\u2217\nHcs\n(Y ; R), H\u2217si (Y ; R) with those on KH \u2217 (Y ; R), KH\u2217 (Y ; R).\n\n5\n\nKuranishi bordism and cobordism\n\nWe now summarize parts of [12, \u00a75] on Kuranishi (co)bordism. They are based\non the classical bordism theory introduced by Atiyah [3]. In fact [12, \u00a75] studies\nfive different kinds of Kuranishi (co)bordism, but we discuss only one.\n\n5.1\n\nClassical bordism and cobordism groups\n\nBordism groups were introduced by Atiyah [3], and Connor [6, \u00a7I] gives a good\nintroduction. Our definition is not standard, but fits in with \u00a75.2.\nDefinition 5.1. Let Y be an orbifold without boundary. Consider pairs (X, f ),\nwhere X is a compact, oriented manifold without boundary or corners, not necessarily connected, and f : X \u2192 Y is a smooth map. An isomorphism between two such pairs (X, f ), (X\u0303, f \u0303) is an orientation-preserving diffeomorphism\ni : X \u2192 X\u0303 with f = f \u0303 \u25e6 i. Write [X, f ] for the isomorphism class of (X, f ).\nLet R be a commutative ring. For each k > 0, define the k th bordism\ngroup Bk (Y ; R) of Y with coefficients in R to be the R-module of finite Rlinear combinations of isomorphism classes [X, f ] for which dim X = k, with\nthe relations:\n(i) [X, f ] + [X \u2032 , f \u2032 ] = [X \u2210 X \u2032 , f \u2210 f \u2032 ] for all classes [X, f ], [X \u2032 , f \u2032 ]; and\n(ii) Suppose Z is a compact, oriented (k + 1)-manifold with boundary but\nwithout (g-)corners, and g : Z \u2192 Y is smooth. Then [\u2202Z, g|\u2202Z ] = 0.\nHere is how this definition relates to those in [3,6]. When Y is a manifold and\nR = Z, our Bk (Y ; Z) is equivalent to Connor's differential bordism group Dk (Y ),\n[6, \u00a7I.9]. Atiyah [3, \u00a72] and Connor [6, \u00a7I.4] also define bordism groups M SOk (Y )\nas for Bk (Y ; Z) above, but only requiring f : X \u2192 Y to be continuous, not\nsmooth. Connor [6, Th. I.9.1] shows that when Y is a manifold, the natural\nprojection Dk (Y ) \u2192 M SOk (Y ) is an isomorphism.\nAs in [6, \u00a7I.5], bordism is a generalized homology theory, that is, it satisfies\nall the Eilenberg\u2013Steenrod axioms for a homology theory except the dimension\naxiom. The bordism groups of a point M SO\u2217 (pt) are known, [6, \u00a7I.2]. This gives\nsome information on bordism groups of general spaces Y : for any generalized\nhomology theory GH\u0001\u2217 (Y ), there is a spectral sequence from the singular homolin GH\u2217 (pt) converging to GH\u2217 (Y ),\nogy H\u2217si Y ; GH\u2217 (pt) of Y with coefficients\n\u0001\nso that GH\u2217 (S n ) \u223c\n= H\u2217si S n ; GH\u2217 (pt) , for instance.\nAtiyah [3] and Connor [6, \u00a713] also define cobordism groups M SOk (Y ) for\nk \u2208 Z, which are a generalized cohomology theory dual to bordism M SOk (Y ).\nThere is a natural product \u222a on M SO\u2217 (Y ), making it into a supercommutative\n\n23\n\n\fring. If Y is a compact, oriented n-manifold without boundary then [3, Th. 3.6],\n[6, Th. 13.4] there are canonical Poincar\u00e9 duality isomorphisms\nM SOk (Y ) \u223c\n= M SOn\u2212k (Y )\n\nfor k \u2208 Z.\n\n(26)\n\nThe definition of M SO\u2217 (Y ) uses homotopy theory, direct limits of k-fold suspensions, and classifying spaces. There does not seem to be a satisfactory\ndifferential-geometric definition of cobordism groups parallel to Definition 5.1.\n\n5.2\n\nKuranishi bordism and cobordism groups\n\nMotivated by \u00a75.1, following [12, \u00a75.2] we define:\nDefinition 5.2. Let Y be an orbifold. Consider pairs (X, f ), where X is a\ncompact, oriented Kuranishi space without boundary, and f : X \u2192 Y is strongly\nsmooth. An isomorphism between two pairs (X, f ), (X\u0303, f \u0303) is an orientationpreserving strong diffeomorphism i : X \u2192 X\u0303 with f = f \u0303 \u25e6 i. Write [X, f ] for\nthe isomorphism class of (X, f ).\nLet R be a commutative ring. For each k \u2208 Z, define the k th Kuranishi\nbordism group KBk (Y ; R) of Y with coefficients in R to be the R-module of\nfinite R-linear combinations of isomorphism classes [X, f ] for which vdim X = k,\nwith the relations:\n(i) [X, f ] + [X \u2032 , f \u2032 ] = [X \u2210 X \u2032 , f \u2210 f \u2032 ] for all classes [X, f ], [X \u2032 , f \u2032 ]; and\n(ii) Suppose W is a compact, oriented Kuranishi space with boundary but\nwithout (g-)corners, with vdim W = k + 1, and e : W \u2192 Y is strongly\nsmooth. Then [\u2202W, e|\u2202W ] = 0.\nElements of KBk (Y ; R) will be called Kuranishi bordism classes.\nLet h : Y \u2192 Z be a smooth map\nP the pushforward\nP of orbifolds. Define\nh\u2217 : KBk (Y ; R) \u2192 KBk (Z; R) by h\u2217 : a\u2208A \u03c1a [Xa , f a ] 7\u2192 a\u2208A \u03c1a [Xa , h\u25e6 f a ].\nThis takes relations (i),(ii) in KBk (Y ; R) to (i),(ii) in KBk (Z; R), and so is welldefined. Pushforward is functorial, that is, (g \u25e6 h)\u2217 = g\u2217 \u25e6 h\u2217 .\nNow Kuranishi bordism KB\u2217 (Y ; R) is like Kuranishi homology KH\u2217 (Y ; R)\nin \u00a73.2, but using Kuranishi spaces X without boundary, and omitting gaugefixing data G. Thus it seems natural to define Kuranishi cobordism KB \u2217 (Y ; R)\nby modifying the definition of Kuranishi cohomology KH \u2217 (Y ; R) in \u00a74.2 in the\nsame way, following [12, \u00a75.4\u2013\u00a75.5].\nDefinition 5.3. Let Y be an orbifold without boundary. Consider pairs (X, f ),\nwhere X is a compact Kuranishi space without boundary, and f : X \u2192 Y is a\ncooriented strong submersion. An isomorphism between two pairs (X, f ), (X\u0303, f \u0303)\nis a coorientation-preserving strong diffeomorphism i : X \u2192 X\u0303 with f = f \u0303 \u25e6 i.\nWrite [X, f ] for the isomorphism class of (X, f ).\nLet R be a commutative ring. For each k \u2208 Z, define the k th Kuranishi\ncobordism group KB k (Y ; R) of Y with coefficients in R to be the R-module of\nfinite R-linear combinations of isomorphism classes [X, f ] for which vdim X =\ndim Y \u2212 k, with the relations:\n24\n\n\f(i) [X, f ] + [X \u2032 , f \u2032 ] = [X \u2210 X \u2032 , f \u2210 f \u2032 ] for all classes [X, f ], [X \u2032 , f \u2032 ]; and\n(ii) Suppose W is a compact Kuranishi space with boundary but without (g-)\ncorners, with vdim W = dim Y \u2212 k + 1, and e : W \u2192 Y is a cooriented\nstrong submersion. Then e|\u2202W : \u2202W \u2192 Y is a cooriented strong submersion, and we impose the relation [\u2202W, e|\u2202W ] = 0 in KB k (Y ; R).\nElements of KB k (Y ; R) will be called Kuranishi cobordism classes.\nDefine the cup product \u222a : KB k (Y ; R) \u00d7 KB l (Y ; R) \u2192 KB k+l (Y ; R) by\n\nhX\n\na\u2208A\n\n\u0002\n\u0003i h X \u0002\n\u0003i X\n\u0002\n\u03c1a X a , f a \u222a\n\u03c3b X\u0303b , f \u0303b =\n\u03c1a \u03c3b Xa \u00d7f\nb\u2208B\n\n \u0303\n\na ,Y,f b\n\na\u2208A, b\u2208B\n\n\u0003\nX\u0303b , \u03c0Y , (27)\n\nfor A, B finite and \u03c1a , \u03c3b \u2208 R. The coorientations on (Xa , f a ) and (X\u0303b , f \u0303b )\ninduce a coorientation on (Xa \u00d7Y X\u0303b , \u03c0Y ) as in \u00a72.7. Similarly, define the cap\nproduct \u2229 : KBk (Y ; R) \u00d7 KB l (Y ; R) \u2192 KBk\u2212l (Y ; R) by the same formula\n(27), where now [Xa , f a ] \u2208 KBk (Y ; R) so that f a is strongly smooth and Xa\noriented, and the orientation on Xa and coorientation for f \u0303b combine to give\nan orientation for Xa \u00d7Y X\u0303b .\nOne can show that \u222a, \u2229 are well-defined, that \u222a is associative and supercommutative, and that (\u03b3 \u2229 \u03b4) \u2229 \u01eb = \u03b3 \u2229 (\u03b4 \u222a \u01eb) for \u03b3 \u2208 KB\u2217 (Y ; R) and\n\u03b4, \u01eb \u2208 KB \u2217 (Y ; R). If Y is also compact then using the trivial coorientation\nfor idY : Y \u2192 Y , we have [Y, idY ] \u2208 KB 0 (Y ; R), which is the identity for \u222a\nand \u2229. Thus, KB \u2217 (Y ; R) is a graded, supercommutative, associative R-algebra,\nwith identity if Y is compact, and without identity otherwise, and \u2229 makes\nKB\u2217 (Y ; R) into a module over KB \u2217 (Y ; R).\nLet Y, Z be orbifolds without boundary, and h : Y \u2192 Z a smooth, proper\n\u2217\nk\nk\nmap. Motivated\nby (20), define\nP the pullback h : KB (Z; R) \u2192 KB (Y ; R)\nP\n\u2217\nby h : a\u2208A \u03c1a [Xa , f a ] 7\u2192 a\u2208A \u03c1a [Y \u00d7h,Z,f a Xa , \u03c0 Y ]. This takes relations\n(i),(ii) in KB k (Z; R) to (i),(ii) in KB k (Y ; R), and so is well-defined. Pullbacks\nare functorial, (g \u25e6 h)\u2217 = h\u2217 \u25e6 g \u2217 . The cup and cap products are compatible with\npullbacks and pushforwards, as in (23).\n\n5.3\n\nMorphisms to and from Kuranishi (co)bordism\n\nIn [12, \u00a75.3\u2013\u00a75.4] we define morphisms between these groups.\nDefinition 5.4.

Let Y be an orbifold, and R a commutative ring. Then KBk (Y ;\nR) is at least as large as the image of Bk (Y ; R) in Hksi (Y ; R \u2297Z Q).\nWe will see in \u00a75.4 that KB\u2217 (Y ; R) is actually very large.\nThe Poincar\u00e9 duality story for Kuranishi (co)homology in \u00a74.3 has an analogue for Kuranishi (co)bordism, as in [12, \u00a75.4]. Let Y be an oriented n-orbifold\nwithout boundary, and R a commutative ring.

Using this and ideas in \u00a75.1 including (26), if Y is a compact\n\u2217\n\u2217\nmanifold we can define a natural morphism \u03a0Kcb\ncb : M SO (Y ) \u2192 KB (Y ; Z),\nso Kuranishi cobordism is a generalization of classical cobordism.\n\n5.4\n\nHow large are Kuranishi (co)bordism groups?\n\nTheorems 3.3 and 4.4 showed that Kuranishi (co)homology are isomorphic to\nclassical (compactly-supported) (co)homology, so they are not new topological\ninvariants. In contrast, Kuranishi (co)bordism are not isomorphic to classical\n(co)bordism, they are genuinely new topological invariants, so it is interesting to\nask what we can say about them. We now summarize the ideas of [12, \u00a75.6\u2013\u00a75.7],\nwhich show that KB\u2217 (Y ; R) and KB \u2217 (Y ; R) are very large for any orbifold Y\nand commutative ring R with Y 6= \u2205 and P\nR \u2297Z Q 6= 0.\nOne reason for this is that in a class a\u2208A \u03c1a [Xa , f a ] in KBk (Y ; R) there\nis a lot of information stored in the orbifold strata of Xa for a \u2208 A. We define\nthese for orbifolds, [12, Def. 5.15].\nDefinition 5.6. Let \u0393 be a finite group, and consider (finite-dimensional) real\nrepresentations (W, \u03c9) of \u0393, that is, W is a finite-dimensional real vector space\n26\n\n\fand \u03c9 : \u0393 \u2192 Aut(W ) is a group morphism. Call (W, \u03c9) a trivial representation\nif \u03c9 \u2261 idW , and a nontrivial representation if Fix(\u03c9(\u0393)) = {0}. Then every\n\u0393-representation (W, \u03c9) has a unique decomposition W = W t \u2295 W nt as the\ndirect sum of a trivial representation (W t , \u03c9 t ) and a nontrivial representation\n(W nt , \u03c9 nt ), where W t = Fix(\u03c9(\u0393)).\nNow let X be an n-orbifold, \u0393 be a finite group, and \u03c1 be an isomorphism class of nontrivial \u0393-representations. Each p \u2208 X has a stabilizer group\nStabX (p). The tangent space Tp X is an n-dimensional vector space with a representation \u03c4p of StabX (p). Let \u03bb : \u0393 \u2192 StabX (p) be an injective group morphism, so that \u03bb(\u0393) is a subgroup of StabX (p) isomorphic to \u0393. Hence \u03c4p \u25e6 \u03bb :\n\u0393 \u2192 Aut(Tp X) is a \u0393-representation, and we can split Tp X = (Tp X)t \u2295 (Tp X)nt\ninto\ntrivial and nontrivial\n\u0393-representations, and form the isomorphism class\n\u0002\n\u0003\n(Tp X)nt , (\u03c4p \u25e6 \u03bb)nt . As a set, define the orbifold stratum X \u0393,\u03c1 to be\n\b\nX \u0393,\u03c1 = StabX (p) * (p, \u03bb) : p \u2208 X, \u03bb : \u0393 \u2192 StabX (p) is an injective\n\u0002\n\u0003\ngroup morphism, (Tp X)nt , (\u03c4p \u25e6 \u03bb)nt = \u03c1 ,\nwhere StabX (p) acts on pairs (p, \u03bb) by \u03c3 : (p, \u03bb) 7\u2192 (p, \u03bb\u03c3 ), where \u03bb\u03c3 : \u0393 \u2192\nStabX (p) is given by \u03bb\u03c3 (\u03b3) = \u03c3\u03bb(\u03b3)\u03c3 \u22121 . Define a map \u03b9\u0393,\u03c1 : X \u0393,\u03c1 \u2192 X\nby \u03b9\u0393,\u03c1 : StabX (p) * (p, \u03bb) 7\u2192 p. Then [12, Prop. 5.16] shows that X \u0393,\u03c1 is an\norbifold of dimension n \u2212 dim \u03c1, and \u03b9\u0393,\u03c1 lifts to a proper, finite immersion.\nIf X is a Kuranishi space, there is a parallel definition [12, Def. 5.18] of\norbifold strata X \u0393,\u03c1 , which we will not give. The most important difference is\nthat \u03c1 is now a virtual nontrivial representation of \u0393, that is, a formal difference\nof nontrivial representations, so that dim \u03c1 \u2208 Z rather than dim \u03c1 \u2208 N. We find\n[12, Prop. 5.19] that X \u0393,\u03c1 is a Kuranishi space with vdim X \u0393,\u03c1 = vdim X\u2212dim \u03c1,\nequipped with a proper, finite, strongly smooth map \u03b9\u0393,\u03c1 : X \u0393,\u03c1 \u2192 X.\nWe would like to define projections \u03a0\u0393,\u03c1 : KBk (Y ; R) \u2192 KBk\u2212dim \u03c1 (Y ; R)\nmapping \u03a0\u0393,\u03c1 : [Xa , f a ] \u2192 [Xa\u0393,\u03c1 , f a |Xa\u0393,\u03c1 ]. But there is a problem: we need\nto define an orientation on Xa\u0393,\u03c1 from the orientation on Xa , and for general\n\u0393, \u03c1 this may not be possible. To overcome this we suppose |\u0393| is odd, which\nimplies that dim \u03c1 is even for all \u03c1, and there is then a consistent way to define\norientations on Xa\u0393,\u03c1 , and \u03a0\u0393,\u03c1 is well-defined.\nLet Y be a nonempty, connected orbifold. In [12, \u00a75.7], for each finite group\n\u0393 with |\u0393| odd and all isomorphism classes \u03c1 of virtual nontrivial representations\n\u0393,\u03c1\nof \u0393, we construct a class C \u0393,\u03c1 \u2208 KBdim \u03c1 (Y ; Z), such that \u03a0Kh\n(C \u0393,\u03c1 ) is\nKb \u25e6 \u03a0\n\u2206,\u03c3\n\u0393,\u03c1\nsi\nnonzero in KH0 (Y ; Q) \u223c\n= Q, and \u03a0 (C ) = 0 if either |\u2206| > |\u0393|\n= H0 (Y ; Q) \u223c\nand \u2206 6\u223c\n= \u0393, or if \u2206 = \u0393 and \u03c1 6= \u03c3. It follows that taken over all isomorphism\nclasses of pairs \u0393, \u03c1, the classes C \u0393,\u03c1 \u2208 KB\u2217 (Y ; Z) are linearly independent\nover Z. Extending to an arbitrary commutative ring R, and using the Poincar\u00e9\nduality ideas of \u00a75.3, we deduce:\nTheorem 5.7. Let Y be a nonempty orbifold, and R a commutative ring with\nR \u2297Z Q 6= 0. Then KB2k (Y ; R) is infinitely generated over R for all k \u2208 Z.\nIf also Y is oriented of dimension n then KB n\u22122k (Y ; R) is infinitely generated\nover R for all k \u2208 Z.\n27\n\n\fTheorem 5.7 supports the idea that Kuranishi bordism, (or better, almost\ncomplex Kuranishi bordism, as in [12, Ch. 5]) may be a useful tool for studying\n(closed) Gromov\u2013Witten invariants.\nQ In [12, \u00a76.2] we define new Gromov\u2013Witten\ntype invariants [Mg,m (M, J, \u03b2), i evi ] in Kuranishi bordism KB\u2217 (M m ; Z).\nTheorem 5.7 indicates that KB\u2217 (M m ; Z) is very large, so that these new invariants contain a lot of information, and that much of this information has to do\nwith the orbifold strata of the moduli spaces Mg,m (M, J, \u03b2).\nAlso, these new invariants are defined in groups KB\u2217 (M m ; Z) over Z, not\nQ. When we project to Kuranishi homology or singular homology to get conventional Gromov\u2013Witten invariants, we must work in homology over Q. The\nreason we cannot work over Z is because of rational contributions from the orbifold strata of Mg,m (M, J, \u03b2). Kuranishi bordism looks like a good framework\nfor describing these contributions, and so for understanding the integrality properties of Gromov\u2013Witten invariants, such as the Gopakumar\u2013Vafa Integrality\nConjecture for Gromov\u2013Witten invariants of Calabi\u2013Yau 3-folds. This is discussed in [12, \u00a76.3], and the author hopes to take it further in [15].\n\nReferences\n[1] A. Adem, J. Leida and Y.
