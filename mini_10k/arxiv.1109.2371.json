String theory also predicts\nquantum corrections to classical gravity theory and the\nGB term is the only one leading to second order differential equations in the metric. On the other hand the\nblack hole solutions in gravity coupled to fields of different types have always drew in much attention, in particular, a great interest in solutions to Einstein-YangMills (EYM) systems [3\u201310]. Wu and Yang [11] obtained static symmetric solution of Yang-Mills equation\nfor the isospin gauge group SO(3). The remarkable feature of this Wu-Yang ansatz is that the field has no contribution from gradient and instead has pure YM nonAbelian component. A curved-space generalization of\nthe Wu-Yang solutions [11] for the gauge group SO(3)\nis shown to be a special case of Yasskin's [3] solutions.\nIt is known that non-Abelian gauge theory coupled to\ngravitation, i.e., EYM results to precisely the geometry\nof Reissner-Nordstr\u00f6m with the charge that determines\nthe geometry is gauge charge [3\u20135]. Indeed, Yasskin [3]\ngave an explicit theorem so that from each solution of the\nEinstein-Maxwell equations one can get solutions of EYM\nequations. One would like to study how these features\nget modified in higher-dimensional (HD) spacetimes and\nwhether this theorem holds in HD spacetimes. Recent developments in string theory indicate that gravity may be\ntruly HD theory, becoming effectively four-dimensional\n(4D) at lower energies. Since non-Abelian gauge fields\nalso feature in the low energy effective action of string\ntheory, it is interesting to study the properties of the\ncorresponding EYM in presence of GB terms. Mazharimousavi and Halilsoy [6, 7] have found static spherically\nsymmetric HD black hole solutions to coupled set of equations of the EYMGB, for SO(N \u22121) gauge group, systems\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\naddress: sghosh2@jmi.ac.in; sgghosh@gmail.com\n\nwhich are based on the Wu and Yang [11] ansatz. The\ncorresponding static topological black holes have been\nfound independently by others [8\u201310].\nIt would be interesting to further consider nonstatic\ngeneralization of Mazharimousavi and Halilsoy solutions\n[6, 7]. It is the purpose of this Letter to obtain an exact\nnonstatic solution of the 5D EYMGB theory in the presence of a null fluid and by employing the Wu-Yang ansatz.\nWe shall present a class of 5D nonstatic solutions describing the exterior of radiating black holes with null fluid\nendowed with gauge charge, i.e., an exact Vaidya-like\nsolution in 5D EYMGB theory. The Vaidya geometry\npermitting the incorporations of the effects of null fluid\noffers a more realistic background than static geometries,\nwhere all back reaction is ignored. It may be noted one of\nfew nonstatic black hole solutions is Vaidya [12] which is a\nsolution of Einstein's equations with spherical symmetry\nfor a null fluid (radially propagating radiation) source. It\nis possible to model the radiating star by matching them\nto exterior Vaidya spacetime (see [13, 14] for reviews on\nVaidya solution and [15] for it's higher-dimensional version). This Letter also examines the effect of the GB\nterms and YM gauge charge on the structure and location of the horizons for the radiating black holes. A black\nhole has three horizon like surface [16, 17]: time-like limit\nsurface (TLS), apparent horizons (AH) and event horizons (EH). In general the three horizon does not coincide\nand they are sensitive to small perturbation. For a classical Schwarzschild black hole (which does not radiate),\nthe three surfaces EH, AH, and TLS are all identical.\nUpon switching on the Hawking evaporation this degeneracy is partially lifted even if the spherical symmetry\nstays. We have then AH=TLS, but the EH is different\nfrom AH=TLS. In particular, the AH is located inside\nthe EH, the portion of spacetime between the two surfaces forming the so-called quantum ergosphere. If we\nbreak spherical symmetry preserving stationarity (e.g.,\nKerr black hole), then AH=EH but EH 6= TLS. Here\nthe ergosphere is the space between the horizon EH=AH\nand the TLS, usually called the static limit [16]. In both\ncases particles and light signals can escape from within\nthe ergosphere and reach infinity. The characteristics of\nEH and AH associated with black holes in 5D EYMGB\n\n\f2\nare also discussed.\nII.\n\nVAIDYA-LIKE SOLUTION IN 5D EYMGB\nTHEORY\n\nhighly nonlinear because of mixing between spacetime\nindices and gauge group indices. However, it is linear\nas expressed in the nonlinear gauge fields because purely\nmagnetic gauge charge is chosen along with position dependent gauge field transformation [3]. The YM field\n2-form is defined by the expression\n\nWe consider SO(4) gauge theory with structure con(\u03b1)\n(\u03b1)\nstant C(\u03b2)(\u03b3) , the YM fields Fab and the YM potential\n(\u03b1)\nAa .

Hence, the spacetime\nhas the scalar polynomial singularity [21] at r = 0. The\nnature (a naked singularity or a black hole) of the singularity can be characterized by the existence of radial null\ngeodesics emerging from the singularity. The singularity\nis at least locally naked if there exist such geodesics, and\nif no such geodesics exist, it is a black hole. The study\nof causal structure of the spacetime is beyond the scope\nof this paper and will be discussed elsewhere [25].\nEnergy conditions: The family of solutions discussed\nhere, in general, belongs to Type II fluid defined in [21].\nWhen m = m(r), we have \u03c8=0, and the matter field\ndegenerates to type I fluid [13, 14]. In the rest frame\nassociated with the observer, the energy density of the\nmatter will be given by\n\u03bc = Tvr , \u03c1 = \u2212Ttt = \u2212Trr\n\n(30)\n\nTii\n\nand the principal pressures are Pi =\n(no sum convention) and due to isotropy P = Pi for all i. a) The\nweak energy conditions (WEC): The energy-momentum\ntensor obeys inequality Tab wa wb \u2265 0 for any time-like\nvector [21], i.e., \u03c8 \u2265 0, \u03c1 \u2265 0, P \u2265 0,. We say that\nstrong energy condition (SEC), holds for Type II fluid if,\nWEC is true., i.e., both WEC and SEC, for a Type II\nfluid, are identical [13].\nb) The dominant energy conditions (DEC) : For any\ntime-like vector wa , T ab wa wb \u2265 0, and T ab wa is nonspace-like vector , i.e., \u03c8 \u2265 0, \u03c1 \u2265 P \u2265 0. Hence WEC\nand SEC are satisfied if \u1e40 (v) \u2265 0.

(20) and the energy-momentum tensor (15). The luminosity due to loss of mass is given by L = \u2212dM/dv,\nwhere L < 1. Both are measured in the region where\nd/dv is time-like. In order to further discuss the physical\nnature of our solutions, we introduce their kinematical\nparameters. As first demonstrated by York [16] and later\nby others [17, 19], the horizons may be obtained to O(L)\nby noting that a null-vector decomposition of the metric\n(4) is made of the form\ngab = \u2212\u03b2a lb \u2212 la \u03b2b + \u03b3ab ,\n\n(31)\n\n1\n\u03b2a = \u2212\u03b4av , la = \u2212 f (v, r)\u03b4av + \u03b4ar ,\n2\n\u03b3ab = r2 \u03b4a\u03b8 \u03b4b\u03b8 + r2 sin2 (\u03b8)\u03b4a\u03c6 \u03b4b\u03c6\nla l\n\na\n\n+r2 sin2 (\u03b8) sin2 (\u03c6)\u03b4a\u03c8 \u03b4b\u03c8 ,\n= \u03b2a \u03b2 a = 0, la \u03b2 a = \u22121, la \u03b3ab = 0,\n\u03b3ab \u03b2 b = 0,\n\n(32)\n\n(33)\n(34)\n\nwith f (v, r) given by Eq.

However, York [16], for\na radiating black holes, argued that the question of the\nescape versus trapping of null rays is, physically, matter\nof qualitative degree and proposed a working definition\nof definition as follows: the EH are strictly null and are\ndefined to order of O(L) and Photons are in captivity by\n\nevent horizon for times long compared to dynamical scale\nof the hole.

From the Eq. (47), it is clear\nthat, in general, the presence of the coupling constant,\nof the GB terms, \u03c9 produces a change in the location of\nhorizons. Such a change could have a significant effect in\nthe dynamical evolution of these horizons. For nonzero \u03c9\nthe structure of the horizons is non-trivial. However, the\neq.

Thus the GB term does not alter\nthe horizons of the 5D EYM black holes.\n\n\f6\nIV.\n\nDISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION\n\nIn this Letter we have obtain an exact black hole solution that describes a null fluid in the framework of\n5D EYMGB theory by employing 5D curved-space generalization Wu-Yang ansatz. Thus we have an explicit\nnonstatic radiating black hole solution of 5D EYMGB\ntheory. We have used the solution to discuss the consequence of GB term and YM charge on the structure and\nlocation of the horizons 5D radiating black hole. The\nAHs are obtained exactly and EHs are obtained to first\norder in luminosity by method developed by York [16].\nWe shown that a 5D radiating black hole in EYGB has\nthree important horizon-like loci that full characterizes\nits structure, viz. AH, EH and TLS and we have relationship of the three surfaces rEH < rAH = rT LS and\nthe region between the AH and EH is defined as quantum ergosphere. The presence of the coupling constant\nof the Gauss-Bonnet terms \u03c9 produces a change in the\nlocation of these horizons [19]. Such a change could have\na significant effect in the dynamical evolution of these\nhorizons. However, It turns out that the presence of the\ncoupling constant of the GB terms \u03c9 > 0 does not alter the location of the horizons from the analogous EYM\ncase, i.e., horizons of the 5D EYM and 5D EYMGB are\nabsolutely same when obtained by procedure suggested\nby York [16] to O(L) by a null-vector decomposition of\nthe metric.\n\n[1] D.

This is because Tab\ngo over\nr\u22124 which is exactly the same as energy momentum of\nEM theory. However, this does not hold in 5D case because components of energy-momentum tensor for EM\nand EYM theories are not same. Thus the Yaaskin's [3]\ntheorem does not hold in 5D case. The 5D solution discussed here incorporates a logarithmic term unprecedent\nin 4D.\nThe family of solutions discussed here belongs to Type\nII fluid. However, if M = constant and the matter field\ndegenerates to Type I fluid, we can generate static black\nhole solutions obtained in [6, 7] by proper choice of these\nconstants. In particular, our results in the limit \u03c9 \u2192 0\nand Q \u2192 0 reduce vis-\u00e0-vis to 5D relativistic case.\nAcknowledgments\n\nWe are grateful to the referee for a number of helpful\nsuggestions for improvement in the Letter.
