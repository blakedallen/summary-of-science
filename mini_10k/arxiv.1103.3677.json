ARMSTRONG, LUIS SILVESTRE, AND CHARLES K. SMART\nAbstract. We prove that a viscosity solution of a uniformly elliptic, fully nonlinear\nequation is C 2,\u03b1 on the compliment of a closed set of Hausdorff dimension at most \u03b5 less\nthan the dimension. The equation is assumed to be C 1 , and the constant \u03b5 > 0 depends\nonly on the dimension and the ellipticity constants. The argument combines the W 2,\u03b5\nestimates of Lin with a result of Savin on the C 2,\u03b1 regularity of viscosity solutions which\nare close to quadratic polynomials.\n\n1. Introduction\nIn this paper, we prove a partial regularity result for viscosity solutions of the uniformly\nelliptic equation\n(1.1)\n\nF (D2 u) = 0.\n\nThe operator F is assumed to be uniformly elliptic and to have uniformly continuous first\nderivatives (these hypotheses are precisely stated in the next section).\nIf F is concave or convex, then solutions of (1.1) in a domain \u03a9 \u2286 Rn are known to\nbelong to C 2,\u03b1 (\u03a9) for some small \u03b1 > 0, according to the famous theorem of Evans [5]\nand Krylov [6] (see also [3] for a simple proof). Viscosity solutions of (1.1) have also been\nshown to be classical solutions for certain classes of nonconvex operators by Yuan [11] as\nwell as Cabr\u00e9 and Caffarelli [1]. The latter result applies, for example, to an F which is the\nminimum of a convex and a concave operator. However, C 2 estimates for solutions of (1.1)\nare unavailable for general F , as attested by the recent counterexamples of Nadirashvili and\nVl\u0103du\u0163 [8, 9]. In fact, a counterexample to C 1,1 regularity was presented in [9], and therefore\nthe best available regularity for solutions of (1.1) is C 1,\u03b1 .\nIn this paper, we study the singular set of a solution u of (1.1), consisting of those points\nx for which u of (1.1) fails to be C 2,\u03b1 in any neighborhood of x. Our result asserts that the\nsingular set has Hausdorff dimension at most n \u2212 \u03b5, where the constant \u03b5 > 0 depends only\non the ellipticity of F and the dimension of the ambient space. The hypotheses (F1) and\n(F2) are stated in Section 2.\nTheorem 1. Assume that F satisfies (F1) and (F2). Let u \u2208 C(\u03a9) be a viscosity solution of\n(1.1) in a domain \u03a9 \u2286 Rn . Then there is a constant \u03b5 > 0, depending only on n, \u03bb, and \u039b,\nand a closed subset \u03a3 \u2286 \u03a9 of Hausdorff dimension at most n \u2212 \u03b5, such that u \u2208 C 2,\u03b1 (\u03a9 \\ \u03a3)\nfor every 0 < \u03b1 < 1.\nAs far as we know, Theorem 1 is the first result which provides an estimate on the\nsmallness of the singular set of a solution of a general uniformly elliptic, fully nonlinear\nDate: October 23, 2018.\n2010 Mathematics Subject Classification. 35B65.\nKey words and phrases. partial regularity, fully nonlinear elliptic equation.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nS.

The constant \u03b5 > 0 which appears in the statement of the theorem is the same \u03b5\nas in the W 2,\u03b5 estimate of Lin [7]; see Remark 5.4.\nLet us describe the idea of the proof of Theorem 1. By differentiating (1.1) and applying\nW 2,\u03b5 estimates to Du, we effectively obtain a W 3,\u03b5 estimate for the solution u. Precisely\nformulated, this implies that u has a global second-order Taylor expansion almost everywhere\nand that the constant in front of the cubic error term lies in L\u03b5 . Near points possessing\nquadratic expansions, we apply a generalization of a result of Savin [10], which asserts that\nany viscosity solution of (1.1) that is sufficiently close to a quadratic polynomial must be\nC 2,\u03b1 . The L\u03b5 integrability of the modulus of the quadratic expansion then restricts the\nHausdorff dimension of the singular set.\nWhile \u03b5 does not depend on the modulus \u03c9 in (F2), the assumption that F is C 1 with\na uniformly continuous first derivative is crucial to our method of proof. In particular,\nTheorem 1 does not apply to Bellman-Isaacs equations, which have the form\n\u0001\n(1.2)\nF (D2 u) := inf sup \u2212 tr(A\u03b1\u03b2 D2 u) = 0.\n\u03b1\u2208I \u03b2\u2208J\n\nSuch operators F are positively homogeneous, and obviously any function which is positively\nhomogeneous and differentiable at the origin is linear. Therefore, the assumption (F2) is\nincompatible with nonlinearity if F is positively homogeneous. We do not know whether\nsuch a partial regularity result is true for equations of the form (1.2).\nIn the next section, we state our notation and some preliminary results needed in the\nproof of Theorem 1. In Sections 3 and 4, we give complete arguments for the W 2,\u03b5 estimate\nand the C 2,\u03b1 regularity for flat solutions of (1.1). The proof of Theorem 1 is presented in\nSection 5.\n2. Preliminaries\nIn this section we state our hypotheses and collect some standard ingredients needed in\nthe proof of Theorem 1.\nNotation and hypotheses. Let Mn denote the set of real n-by-n matrices, and Sn \u2286 Mn\nthe set of symmetric matrices. Recall that the Pucci extremal operators are defined for\nconstants 0 < \u03bb \u2264 \u039b and M \u2208 Sn by\nP+\n\u03bb,\u039b (M ) :=\n\nsup\n\u03bbIn \u2264A\u2264\u039bIn\n\n\u2212 tr(AM )\n\nand P\u2212\n\u03bb,\u039b (M ) :=\n\ninf\n\n\u03bbIn \u2264A\u2264\u039bIn\n\n\u2212 tr(AM ).\n\nThroughout this paper, we assume the nonlinear operator F : Sn \u2192 R satisfies the following:\n(F1) F is uniformly elliptic and Lipschitz; precisely, we assume that there exist constants\n0 < \u03bb \u2264 \u039b such that, for every M, N \u2208 Sn ,\n+\nP\u2212\n\u03bb,\u039b (M \u2212 N ) \u2264 F (M ) \u2212 F (N ) \u2264 P\u03bb,\u039b (M \u2212 N ).\n\n(F2) F is C 1 and its derivative DF is uniformly continuous, that is, there exists an\nincreasing continuous function \u03c9 : [0, \u221e) \u2192 [0, \u221e) such that \u03c9(0) = 0, and for\nevery M, N \u2208 Sn ,\n|DF (M ) \u2212 DF (N )| \u2264 \u03c9(|M \u2212 N |) .\n\nWe call a constant universal if it depends only on the dimension n, the ellipticity constants\n\u03bb and \u039b, and the modulus \u03c9. Throughout, c and C denote positive universal constants\nwhich may vary from line to line. We denote by Qx,r the cube centered at x and of side\n\n\fPARTIAL REGULARITY FOR FULLY NONLINEAR ELLIPTIC EQUATIONS\n\n3\n\nlength 2r.

Balls are\nwritten B(x, r) := {y \u2208 Rn : |y \u2212 x| < r} and Br := B(0, r).\nRecall that the Hausdorff dimension of a set E \u2286 Rn is defined by\n\u001a\nHdim (E) := inf 0 \u2264 s < \u221e : for all \u03b4 > 0, there exists a collection {B(xj , rj )} of balls\nsuch that E \u2286\n\n\u221e\n[\n\nB(xj , rj ) and\n\nj=1\n\n\u221e\nX\nj=1\n\n\u001b\nrjs < \u03b4 .\n\nStandard results. In this subsection, we state three results needed below. Proofs of all\nthree of these results can be found in [2]. We first recall the statement of the AlexandroffBakelman-Pucci (ABP) inequality. We use the notation u+ = max{0, u} and u\u2212 :=\n\u2212 min{0, u}.\nProposition 2.1 (ABP inequality). Assume that BR \u2286 Rn and f \u2208 C(BR ) \u2229 L\u221e (BR ).\nSuppose that u \u2208 C(BR ) satisfies inequality\n( +\nP\u03bb,\u039b (D2 u) \u2265 f in BR ,\nu\u22650\n\non \u2202BR .\n\nThen\nsup u\u2212 \u2264 CRkf + kLn ({\u0393u =u}) ,\nBR\n\nwhere C is a universal constant and \u0393u is the convex envelope in B2R of \u2212u\u2212 , where we\nhave extended u \u2261 0 outside BR .\nWe next recall an interior C 1,\u03b1 regularity result for solutions of (1.1).\nProposition 2.2. If u is a viscosity solution of (1.1) in B1 , then u \u2208 C 1,\u03b1 (B 1/2 ) for some\nuniversal 0 < \u03b1 < 1.\nFinally, we recall a consequence of the Calder\u00f3n-Zygmund cube decomposition. This\nappeared in a slightly different form as [2, Lemma 4.2].\nProposition 2.3. Suppose that D \u2286 E \u2286 Q1 are measurable and 0 < \u03b4 < 1 is such that:\n\u2022 |D| \u2264 \u03b4|Q1 |; and\n\u2022 if x \u2208 Rn and r > 0 such that Qx,3r \u2286 Q1 and |D \u2229 Qx,r | \u2265 \u03b4|Qr |, then Qx,3r \u2286 E.\nThen |D| \u2264 \u03b4|E|.\n3. W 2,\u03b5 estimate\nAn integral estimate for the second derivatives of strong solutions of linear, uniformly\nelliptic equations in nondivergence form with only measurable coefficients was first obtained\nby Lin [7]. It was later extended to viscosity solutions of fully nonlinear equations in [2].\nTo state the estimate, we require some notation. Given a domain \u03a9 \u2286 Rn and a function\nu \u2208 C(\u03a9), define the quantities\n\b\n\u0398(x) = \u0398(u, \u03a9)(x) := inf A \u2265 0 : there exists p \u2208 Rn such that for all y \u2208 \u03a9,\nu(y) \u2265 u(x) + p * (x \u2212 y) \u2212 21 A|x \u2212 y|2 ,\n\n\f4\n\nS. N. ARMSTRONG, L. SILVESTRE, AND C. K. SMART\n\n\b\n\u0398(x) = \u0398(u, \u03a9)(x) := inf A \u2265 0 : there exists p \u2208 Rn such that for all y \u2208 \u03a9,\n\nu(y) \u2264 u(x) + p * (x \u2212 y) + 21 A|x \u2212 y|2 ,\n\nand\n\n\b\n\u0398(x) := \u0398(u, \u03a9)(x) = max \u0398(u, \u03a9)(x), \u0398(u, \u03a9)(x) .\nThe quantity \u0398(x) is the minimum curvature of any paraboloid that touches u from below\nat x. If u cannot be touched from below at x by any paraboloid, then \u0398(x) = +\u221e. A\nsimilar statement holds for \u0398(x), where we touch from above instead.\nThe form of the W 2,\u03b5 estimates we need is contained in the following proposition.\nProposition 3.1. If u \u2208 C(B1 ) satisfies the inequality\n2\nP+\n\u03bb,\u039b (D u) \u2265 0\n\n(3.1)\n\nin B1 ,\n\nthen for all t > t0 supB1 |u|,\n\b\n(3.2)\nx \u2208 B1/2 : \u0398(u, B1 )(x) > t\n\n\u2264 Ct\u2212\u03b5 ,\n\nwhere the constants C, t0 , \u03b5 > 0 are universal.\n\nObviously (3.2) implies that for any 0 < \u03b5\u0302 < \u03b5,\n\u02c6\n\u03b5\u0302\n(3.3)\n(\u0398(u, B1 )(x)) dx \u2264 C sup |u|\u03b5\u0302 ,\nB1\n\nB1/2\n\nwhere the constant C depends additionally on a lower bound for \u03b5 \u2212 \u03b5\u0302.\n\nProposition 3.1 is stated differently than the corresponding estimate in [2]. We emphasize\nhere that \u0398(u, \u03a9)(x) is defined in terms of quadratic polynomials which touch u at x and stay\nbelow u in the full domain \u03a9. That Proposition 3.1 is stated in terms of such a quantity is\ncrucial to its application in the proof of Theorem 1. Indeed, if instead of Proposition 3.1 we\nhad the weaker statement that u is twice differentiable at almost every point, and |D2 u| \u2208 L\u03b5 ,\nthen this would be insufficient to prove the partial regularity result.\nFor completeness and because of our alternative formulation, we give a simplified proof of\nProposition 3.1 following the along the lines of the argument in [2]. The heart of the proof\nis following consequence of the ABP inequality. We recall that Q1 \u2282 Q3 and Q3 \u2282 B6\u221an .\nLemma 3.2. Assume that \u03a9 \u2286 Rn is open and B 6\u221an \u2286 \u03a9.

Since |P\u0303k | \u2264 C\u03b4\u03b7 \u03b1k in B1 , its coefficients are bounded by C\u03b4\u03b7 \u03b1k . More precisely, if\nP\u0303 = ak + bk * x + x * Ck x, then |ak | + |bk | + |Ck | \u2264 C\u03b4\u03b7 \u03b1k . Therefore\nPk+1 \u2212 Pk = \u03b7 2k P\u0303k (\u03b7 \u2212k x) = \u03b7 2k ak + \u03b7 k bk * x + xt Ck x.\n\n\f10\n\nS. N. ARMSTRONG, L. SILVESTRE, AND C. K.

Partial regularity\n\nIn this section, we prove our main result. We first apply the W 2,\u03b5 estimate in Proposition 3.1 to the derivative of u, in effect deriving a W 3,\u03b5 estimate, and then to use this result\nand a scaling argument combined with Proposition 4.1 to obtain the theorem.\nTo state the W 3,\u03b5 estimate, we define the quantity\n\b\n\u03a8(u, \u03a9)(x) := inf A \u2265 0 : there exists p \u2208 Rn and M \u2208 Mn such that for all y \u2208 \u03a9,\n\n|u(y) \u2212 u(x) + p * (x \u2212 y) + (x \u2212 y) * M (x \u2212 y)| \u2264 16 A|x \u2212 y|3 .\n\nThe following lemma records an elementary relation between \u03a8(u, B1 ) and \u0398(uxi , B1 ).\nLemma 5.1. Assume that u \u2208 C 1 (B1 ). Then for each x \u2208 B1 ,\n!1/2\nn\nX\n2\n(\u0398(uxi , B1 )(x))\n(5.1)\n\u03a8(u, B1 )(x) \u2264\n.\ni=1\n\nProof. Suppose that x \u2208 B1 and Ai \u2265 0 are such that \u0398(uxi , B1 )(x) \u2264 Ai for each i =\n1, . . . , n. Then we can find vectors p1 , . . . , pn \u2208 Rn such that\n1\nuxi (y) \u2212 uxi (x) + pi * (x \u2212 y) \u2264 Ai |x \u2212 y|2 for all y \u2208 B1 .\n(5.2)\n2\nLet M \u2208 Mn be the matrix with entries 21 pij .

A similar statement was used by Caffarelli and Souganidis [4]\nto obtain an algebraic rate of convergence for monotone finite difference approximations of\nuniformly elliptic equations.\n\nLemma 5.2. Suppose u \u2208 C(B1 ) solves (1.1) in B1 and satisfies supB1 |u| \u2264 1. There are\nuniversal constants C, \u03b5 > 0 such that, if t > 1, then\n\b\n(5.4)\nx \u2208 B1/2 : \u03a8(u, B1 )(x) > t \u2264 Ct\u2212\u03b5 .\n\nProof. According to Proposition 2.2, we have that u \u2208 C 1 (B1 ). Moreover, according to [2,\nProposition 5.5], for every unit direction e \u2208 Rn , |e| = 1, the function ue := e * Du satisfies\nthe inequalities\n+\n2\n2\nP\u2212\n\u03bb,\u039b (D ue ) \u2264 0 \u2264 P\u03bb,\u039b (D ue ) in B1 ,\nin the viscosity sense. According to Proposition 3.1, we have, for each t > 1,\n\b\nx \u2208 B1/2 : \u0398(u, B1 )(x) > t \u2264 Ct\u2212\u03b5 ,\n\nwhere C, \u03b5 > 0 are universal constants. An application of Lemma 5.1 yields (5.4).\n\n\u0003\n\nLemma 5.3. Suppose that u satisfies the hypotheses of Lemma 5.2 and that 0 < \u03b1 < 1.\n1\n,\nThere is a universal constant \u03b4\u03b1 > 0, such that for every y \u2208 B1/2 and 0 < r < 16\n\b\n\u22121\n2,\u03b1\n(5.5)\n\u03a8(u, B1 ) \u2264 r \u03b4\u03b1 \u2229 B(y, r) 6= \u2205\nimplies that\nu \u2208 C (B(y, r)).\nProof. Suppose that 0 < r <\n\n1\n16 ,\n\ny \u2208 B1/2 , and z \u2208 B(y, r) is such that\n\u03a8(u, B1 )(z) \u2264 r\u22121 \u03b4.\n\nThen there exist p \u2208 Rn and M \u2208 Mn such that, for every x \u2208 B1 ,\n(5.6)\n\n|u(x) \u2212 u(z) + p * (z \u2212 x) + (z \u2212 x) * M (z \u2212 x)| \u2264 16 r\u22121 \u03b4|z \u2212 x|3 .\n\nReplacing M by 21 (M + M t ), we may assume that M \u2208 Sn . Since u is a viscosity solution\nof (1.1), it is clear that F (\u2212M ) = 0. Define the function\n\u0001\n1\nv(x) :=\nu(z + 4rx) \u2212 u(z) + 4rp * x + 16r2 x * M x , x \u2208 B1 .\n16r2\nThe inequality (5.6) implies that\nsup |v| \u2264 31 \u03b4.\nB1\n\nDefine the operator Fe(N ) := F (N \u2212 M ), and observe Fe satisfies (F1) and (F2), with the\nsame ellipticity constants \u03bb, \u039b, and modulus \u03c9, and Fe(0) = F (\u2212M ) = 0. It is clear that v\nis a solution of\nFe (D2 v) = 0 in B1 .\n\n\f12\n\nS. N. ARMSTRONG, L. SILVESTRE, AND C. K. SMART\n\nLet \u03b40 > 0 be the universal constant in Proposition 4.1, which also depends on \u03b1. Suppose\nthat \u03b4 \u2264 3\u03b40 . Then Proposition 4.1 yield that v \u2208 C 2,\u03b1 (B1/2 ), from which we deduce that\nu \u2208 C 2,\u03b1 (B(z, 2r)). Since B(y, r) \u2286 B(z, 2r), we are done.\n\u0003\nProof of Theorem 1. By a standard covering argument, we may fix 0 < \u03b1 < 1 and assume\nthat \u03a9 = B1 , u \u2208 C(B1 ) is bounded, and to show that u \u2208 C 2,\u03b1 (B1/2 \\ \u03a3) for a set \u03a3 \u2286 B 1/2\nwith Hdim (\u03a3) \u2264 n \u2212 \u03b5. Since, for every t > 0, the operator Ft (M ) := t\u22121 F (tM ) satisfies\nboth (F1) and (F2) with the same constants \u03bb, \u039b but a different modulus \u03c9. Since the\nconstant \u03b5 > 0 we obtain does not depend on \u03c9, we may therefore assume without loss of\ngenerality that supB1 |u| \u2264 1.\n\nLet \u03a3 \u2286 B1/2 denote the set of points x \u2208 B1/2 for which u 6\u2208 C 2,\u03b1 (B(x, r)), for every\n1\n. According to the Vitali\nr > 0. Notice that \u03a3 is closed, and thus compact. Fix 0 < r < 16\nm\nCovering Theorem, there exists a finite collection {B(xi , r)}i=1 of disjoint balls of radius r,\nwith centers xi \u2208 \u03a3, such that\nm\n[\nB(xi , 3r).\n\u03a3\u2286\ni=1\n\nSince xi \u2208 \u03a3, according to Lemma 5.3 there exists a universal constant \u03b4, also depending\non \u03b1, such that\nm\n[\nB(xi , r).\n\u03a8(u, B1 )(y) > r\u22121 \u03b4 for every y \u2208\ni=1\n\nApplying Lemma 5.2, we deduce that\n\nmrn \u2264 Cm|Br | \u2264 Cr\u2212\u03b5\n\nfor universal constants C, \u03b5 > 0. Therefore,\nm\nX\n|B(xi , 3r)|n\u2212\u03b5 \u2264 C.\ni=1\n\nWe deduce that H\n\nn\u2212\u03b5\n\n(\u03a3) \u2264 C for a universal constant C. Therefore, Hdim (\u03a3) \u2264 n \u2212 \u03b5. \u0003\n\nRemark 5.4. An inspection of the proof reveals that the codimension \u03b5 in Theorem 1 is\nequal to the exponent \u03b5 of the W 2,\u03b5 estimate of Proposition 3.1. In particular, it does not\ndepend on the modulus \u03c9 of DF . It follows that we could further reduce the dimension of\nthe singular set if we could improve the exponent of the W 2,\u03b5 estimate. However, it is not\npossible to improve the exponent \u03b5 in the W 2,\u03b5 estimate, since as we saw in Remark 3.3,\nthe constant \u03b5 is at most 2(\u039b/\u03bb + 1)\u22121 .\nAcknowledgment.
