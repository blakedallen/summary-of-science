SINGH\nAbstract. For a Noetherian local domain (R, m, K), it is an open question\nwhether strong F\u2013regularity deforms. We provide an affirmative answer to this\nquestion when the canonical module satisfies certain additional assumptions.\nThe techniques used here involve passing to a Gorenstein ring, using an anti\u2013\ncanonical cover.\n\n1. Introduction\nThroughout our discussion, all rings are commutative, Noetherian, and have\nan identity element. Unless specified otherwise, we shall be working with rings\ncontaining a field of characteristic p > 0. The theory of the tight closure of an\nideal or a submodule of a module was developed by Melvin Hochster and Craig\nHuneke in [HH2] and draws attention to rings which have the property that all\ntheir ideals are tightly closed, called weakly F\u2013regular rings. This property turn\nout to be of significant importance, for instance the Hochster\u2013Roberts theorem of\ninvariant theory that direct summands of polynomial rings are Cohen\u2013Macaulay\n([HR1]), can actually be proved for the much larger class of weakly F\u2013regular rings.\nA closely related notion is that of a strongly F\u2013regular ring. The recent work of\nLyubeznik and Smith (see [LS]) shows that the properties of weak F\u2013regularity and\nstrong F\u2013regularity agree for N\u2013graded F\u2013finite rings.\nWhether the property of strong F\u2013regularity deforms has been a persistent open\nquestion, specifically, if R/xR is strongly F\u2013regular for some nonzerodivisor x \u2208 m,\nis R strongly F\u2013regular? A similar question may be posed when (R, m, K) is a ring\ngraded by the nonnegative integers, and x \u2208 m is a homogeneous nonzerodivisor.\nWe examine these questions using the idea of passing to an anti\u2013canonical cover S =\n\u2295i\u22650 I (i) ti (where I represents the inverse of the canonical module in Cl(R)) and get\npositive answers when the symbolic powers I (i) satisfy the Serre condition S3 for all\ni \u2265 0 and S is Noetherian. It was earlier known that strong F\u2013regularity deforms\nfor Gorenstein rings, [HH3, Theorem 4.2], and our results here may be considered\nan extension of those ideas. Another case when it is known that strong F\u2013regularity\ndeforms is in the case of Q\u2013Gorenstein rings, see [AKM] and for the characteristic\nzero case, [Sm]. It is interesting to note that all currently known results on the\ndeformation of strong F\u2013regularity require somewhat restrictive hypotheses which\nare weaker forms of the Gorenstein hypothesis - while Q\u2013Gorenstein is a natural\nweakening of the Gorenstein condition, the hypotheses required in our results are\nmost obviously satisfied when R is Gorenstein!\nDate: November 21, 1997.\n1991 Mathematics Subject Classification.

SINGH\n\nAnother notion ubiquitous in characteristic p methods is that of F\u2013purity i.e.,\nthe property that for a ring R of characteristic p, the Frobenius map remains\ninjective upon tensoring with any R-module, see [HR2]. The corresponding question\nabout the deformation of F\u2013purity has a negative answer, the first examples being\nprovided by R. Fedder in [Fe1]. However Fedder points out that his examples are\nless than satisfactory in two ways: firstly the rings are not integral domains, and\nsecondly his arguments provide relevant examples only for finitely many choices\nof the characteristic p of K. We point out various examples that have already\nbeen studied in different contexts which overcome both these shortcomings, but\nnow another shortcoming stands out - although the rings R are domains (which\nare not F\u2013pure), the F\u2013pure quotient rings R/xR are not domains. The obvious\nquestion then arises: if R/xR is an F\u2013pure domain, is R F\u2013pure? An even more\ninteresting question would be whether the property of being an F\u2013pure normal\ndomain deforms.\nIn section 6 we shall use cyclic covers to study graded rings of dimension two, and\ndevelop a criterion for the strong F\u2013regularity of such rings when the characteristic\nof the field is zero or a \"sufficiently large\" prime. By a graded ring we shall mean,\nunless stated otherwise, a ring graded by the nonnegative integers, with R0 = K,\na field. We shall denote by m = R+ , the homogeneous maximal ideal of R, and by\na system of parameters for R, we shall mean a sequence of homogeneous elements\nof R whose images form a system of parameters for Rm . In specific examples\ninvolving homomorphic images of polynomial rings, lower case letters shall denote\nthe images of the corresponding variables, the variables being denoted by the upper\ncase letters. We shall also implicitly assume our rings are homomorphic images of\nGorenstein rings, and so possess canonical modules.\n\n2. Frobenius closure and tight closure\nLet R be a Noetherian ring of characteristic p > 0. The letter e denotes a\nvariable nonnegative integer, and q its e th power, i.e., q = pe . We shall denote by\nF , the Frobenius endomorphism of R, and by F e , its e th iteration, i.e., F e (r) = rq .\nFor an ideal I = (x1 , . . . , xn ) \u2286 R, let I [q] = (xq1 , . . . , xqn ). Note that F e (I)R = I [q] ,\nwhere q = pe , as always. Let S denote the ring R viewed as an R\u2013algebra via F e .\nThen S \u2297R is a covariant functor from R\u2013modules to S\u2013modules. If we consider\na map of free modules Rn \u2192 Rm given by the matrix (rij ), applying F e we get\nq\na map Rn \u2192 Rm given by the matrix (rij\n). For an R\u2013module M , note that the\ne\n\u2032\nR\u2013module structure on F (M ) is r (r \u2297 m) = r\u2032 r \u2297 m, and r\u2032 \u2297 rm = r\u2032 rq \u2297 m.\n[q]\nFor R\u2013modules N \u2286 M , we use NM to denote Im(F e (N ) \u2192 F e (M )).\nFor a reduced ring R of characteristic p > 0, R1/q shall denote the ring obtained\nby adjoining all q th roots of elements of R. The ring R is said to be F\u2013finite if\nR1/p is module\u2013finite over R. Note that a finitely generated algebra R over a field\nK is F\u2013finite if and only if K 1/p is finite over K.\n\u25e6\n\nWe shall denote by R the complement of the union of the minimal primes of R.\nWe say I = (x1 , . . . , xn ) \u2286 R is a parameter ideal if the images of x1 , . . . , xn form\npart of a system of parameters in RP , for every prime ideal P containing I.\n\n\fDEFORMATION OF F-PURITY AND F-REGULARITY\n\n3\n\nDefinition 2.1. Let R be a ring of characteristic p, and I an ideal of R. For an\nelement x of R, we say that x \u2208 I F , the Frobenius closure of I, if there exists\nq = pe such that xq \u2208 I [q] .\n\u2217\nFor R\u2013modules N \u2286 M and u \u2208 M , we say that u \u2208 NM\n, the tight closure of\n\u25e6\n[q]\nq\nN in M , if there exists c \u2208 R such that cu \u2208 NM for all q = pe \u226b 0. It is worth\nrecording this when M = R, and N = I is an ideal of R. For an element x of R, we\n\u25e6\nsay that x \u2208 I \u2217 , the tight closure of I, if there exists c \u2208 R such that cxq \u2208 I [q]\ne\n\u2217\nfor all q = p \u226b 0. If I = I, we say that the ideal I is tightly closed.\n\nIt is easily verified that I \u2286 I F \u2286 I \u2217 . Furthermore, I \u2217 is always contained in the\nintegral closure of I, and is frequently much smaller.\nDefinition 2.2. A ring R is said to be F\u2013pure if the Frobenius homomorphism\nF : M \u2192 F (M ) is injective for all R\u2013modules M .\nA ring R is said to be weakly F\u2013regular if every ideal of R is tightly closed, and\nis F\u2013regular if every localization is weakly F\u2013regular. A weakly F\u2013regular ring is\nF\u2013pure.\n\u25e6\n\nAn F\u2013finite ring R is strongly F\u2013regular if for every element c \u2208 R , there exists\nan integer q = pe such that the R\u2013linear inclusion R \u2192 R1/q sending 1 to c1/q splits\nas a map of R\u2013modules.\nR is said to be F\u2013rational if every parameter ideal of R is tightly closed.\nThe equivalence of the notions of strong F\u2013regularity, F\u2013regularity, and weak F\u2013\nregularity, in general, is a persistent open problem. It is known that these notions\nagree when the canonical module is a torsion element of the divisor class group, see\n[Ma] and [Wi], and so when this hypothesis is satisfied, we switch freely between\nthese notions. Furthermore, Lyubeznik and Smith have shown that graded F\u2013finite\nrings are weakly F\u2013regular if and only if they are strongly F\u2013regular, [LS, Corollary\n4.3].\nTheorem 2.3.\n(1) An F\u2013finite regular domain of characteristic p is strongly F\u2013regular.\n(2) A strongly F\u2013regular ring is F\u2013regular, and an F\u2013regular ring is weakly F\u2013\nregular.\n(3) Let S be a strongly (weakly) F\u2013regular ring. If R is a subring of S which is\na direct summand of S as an R\u2013module, then R is strongly (weakly) F\u2013regular.\n(4)\nAn F\u2013rational ring R is normal. If in addition, R is assumed to be he\nhomomorphic image of a Cohen\u2013Macaulay ring, then R is Cohen\u2013Macaulay.\n(5) An F\u2013rational Gorenstein ring is F\u2013regular. If it is F\u2013finite, then it is also\nstrongly F\u2013regular.\nProof. (1) follows from the fact that the Frobenius endomorphism over a regular\nlocal ring is flat. For all the assertions about strong F\u2013regularity see [HH1, Theorem\n3.1]. The results on F\u2013rationality (4) and (5) are part of [HH3, Theorem 4.2]. \u0003\n3. F\u2013purity does not deform\nWe recall a useful result, [HR2, Proposition 5.38].\n\n\f4\n\nANURAG K. SINGH\n\nProposition 3.1. Let R = K[X1 , . . . , Xn ]/I where K is a field of characteristic p\nand I is an ideal generated by square\u2013free monomials in the variables X1 , . . . , Xn .\nThen R is F\u2013pure.\nIn [Fe1] Fedder constructs a family of examples for which F\u2013purity does not\ndeform. He points out that the examples have two shortcomings, firstly that they\ndo not work for large primes, and secondly that the rings are not integral domains.\nWe next review a special case of Fedder's examples and point out that it does serve\nas a counterexample to the deformation of F\u2013purity for all choices of the prime\ncharacteristic p of the field K.\nExample 3.2. Let R = K[U, V, Y, Z]/(U V, U Z, Z(V \u2212 Y 2 )). Fedder's work shows\nthat when the characteristic of the field K is 2, then R is not F\u2013pure, although R/yR\nis F\u2013pure. We shall show here that this does not depend on the prime characteristic\np of K, by showing that y 3 z 4 \u2208\n/ I where I = y 2 (u2 \u2212 z 4 )R but (y 3 z 4 )p \u2208 I [p] . As for\nthe assertion that R/yR is F\u2013pure, note that R/yR \u223c\n= K[U, V, Z]/(U V, U Z, ZV )\nand so F\u2013purity follows from the above proposition.\nIn R/I [p] we have (y 3 z 4 )p = vy 3p\u22122 z 4p = vy 3p\u22122 u2p = 0 and it only remains to\nshow that y 3 z 4 \u2208\n/ I. Consider the grading on R where u, v, y and z have weights\n2, 2, 1 and 1 respectively. If y 3 z 4 \u2208 I, we have an equation in K[U, V, Y, Z] of the\nform\nY 3 Z 4 = A(Y 2 (U 2 \u2212 Z 4 )) + B(U V ) + C(U Z) + D(Z(V \u2212 Y 2 )).\nThe polynomial A is of degree 1 and so must be a linear combination of Y and Z.\nExamining this modulo (U, V ), we see that A = \u2212Y , and so Y 3 U 2 = B(U V ) +\nC(U Z) + D(Z(V \u2212 Y 2 )). Dividing through by U , we have Y 3 U = B(V ) + C(Z) +\nD\u2032 (Z(V \u2212 Y 2 )) where D = U D\u2032 , but then Y 3 U \u2208 (V, Z), a contradiction.\nWe next use the idea of rational coefficient Weil divisors to construct a large\nfamily of two dimensional normal domains for which F\u2013purity does not deform,\nindependent of the characteristic of the field K. These examples, as presented, are\nfor the graded case but local examples are obtained by the obvious localization\nat the homogeneous maximal ideal. We recall some notation and results from\n[De, Wa1, Wa2].\nDefinition 3.3. By a rational coefficient Weil divisor on a normal projective variety X, we mean a linear combination of codimension one irreducible subvarieties\nof X, with coefficients in Q.\nLet K(X) denote the field of rational functions on X. Each f \u2208 K(X) gives us a\nWeil divisor div(f ) by considering its zeros and poles with appropriate multiplicity.\nFor a divisor D, we shall say D \u2265 0 if each coefficient of D is nonnegative. Recall\nthat for a Weil divisor D on X, we have\nH 0 (X, OX (D)) = {f \u2208 K(X) : div(f ) + D \u2265 0}.\nP\nIf D =P ni Vi with ni \u2208 Q is a rational coefficient Weil divisor on X, we shall set\n[D] = [ni ]Vi , where [n] denotes the greatest integer less than or equal to n, and\ndefine OX (D) = OX ([D]). With this notation, Demazure's result is:\nTheorem 3.4. Let R = \u2295n\u22650 Rn be a graded normal ring where R0 = K is a field.\nThen R can be described by a rational coefficient Weil divisor D on X = Proj(R)\n\n\fDEFORMATION OF F-PURITY AND F-REGULARITY\n\n5\n\nsatisfying the condition that N D is an ample Cartier divisor for some integer N >\n0, in the form\nR = R(X, D) = \u2295n\u22650 H 0 (X, OX (nD))T n \u2286 K(X)[T ],\nwhere T is a homogeneous element of degree one in the quotient field of R. This\nidentification preserves the grading, i.e., Rn = H 0 (X, OX (nD))T n .\nP\nFor a rational coefficient Weil divisor D =\n(pi /qi )Vi for pi and qi relatively\nP\nprime integers with qi > 0, we define D\u2032 = ((qi \u2212 1)/qi )Vi to be the fractional\npart of D. Note that with this definition of D\u2032 we have, for a positive integer n,\n\u2212[\u2212nD] = [nD + D\u2032 ].\nLet D be a rational coefficient Weil divisor on X such that for some integer\nN > 0, N D is an ample Cartier divisors, and let R = R(X, D) as above. One\ncan get the following descriptions of the symbolic powers of the canonical module\nand their highest local cohomology modules, see [Wa1, Wa2]. If X is a smooth\nprojective variety of dimension d with canonical divisor KX and \u03c9 is the canonical\nmodule of R, we have\n[\u03c9 (i) ]n = H 0 (X, OX (i(KX + D\u2032 ) + nD))T n ,\nd+1\n[Hm\n(\u03c9 (i) )]n = H d (X, OX (i(KX + D\u2032 ) + nD))T n .\nIt is easily seen that we can identify the action of the Frobenius on the n th graded\nd+1\npiece of the injective hull ER (K) = [Hm\n(\u03c9)]n of K (as a graded R\u2013module) with\nthe map\n\nH d (X, OX (KX + D\u2032 + nD))T n \u2192 H d (X, OX (p(KX + D\u2032 + nD)))T pn .\nThe action of the Frobenius on the socle of ER (K) corresponds to the piece of this\nmap in degree zero, i.e.,\nH d (X, OX (KX + D\u2032 )) \u2192 H d (X, OX (p(KX + D\u2032 ))).\nRemark 3.5. In the above notation, if the ring R is F\u2013pure, then the action of the\nFrobenius on ER (K) is injective and so H d (X, OX (p(KX + D\u2032 ))) must be nonzero.\nExample 3.6. We first fix positive integers n and k such that 1/n + 2/k < 1. Take\nP1 = Proj K[X, Y ], choose k distinct nonzero elements \u03b11 , . . . , \u03b1k in the field K,\nand construct the rational coefficient Weil divisor on P1\nD = (1/n)V (X \u2212 \u03b11 Y ) + * * * + (1/n)V (X \u2212 \u03b1k Y ).\nNext construct the graded ring R = R(P1 , D) where\nR = \u2295i\u22650 Ri = \u2295i\u22650 H 0 (P1 , OP1 (iD))Y i ,\nsee [De]. Let \u2206i = (X \u2212 \u03b11 Y ) . . . (X \u2212 \u03b1i\u22121 Y )(X \u2212 \u03b1i+1 Y ) . . . (X \u2212 \u03b1k Y ) for\n1 \u2264 i \u2264 k and \u2206 = (X \u2212 \u03b11 Y ) . . . (X \u2212 \u03b1k Y ). Then R is generated by the elements\nY, A1 , . . . , Ak where Ai = \u2206i XY n /\u2206 for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 k. Now for i 6= j, Ai Aj \u2208 Y R,\nand it is easily verified that\nR/Y R \u223c\n= K[A1 , . . . , Ak ]/(Ai Aj : i 6= j).\nSince (Ai Aj : i 6= j) is an ideal generated by square\u2013free monomials, the ring\nR/Y R is F\u2013pure. To see that R is not F\u2013pure, by Remark 3.5 it suffices to see\nthat H 1 (P1 , OP1 (p(KP1 + D\u2032 ))) = 0. Note that by Serre duality, the vector space\ndual of this is H 0 (P1 , OP1 ((1 \u2212 p)(KP1 + D\u2032 ))), and it certainly suffices to show\n\n\f6\n\nANURAG K. SINGH\n\nthat this is zero. Since we picked n and k satisfying 1/n + 2/k < 1, we get that\ndeg(1 \u2212 p)(KP1 + D\u2032 ) = k(p \u2212 1)(1/n + 2/k \u2212 1) is negative, and so H 0 (P1 , OP1 ((1 \u2212\np)(KP1 + D\u2032 ))) = 0.\nIt is easy to see that the ring R is actually F\u2013rational. The elements Y, A1 +* * *+\nAk form a homogeneous system of parameters for R, and since R/Y R is F\u2013pure,\nthe ideal (Y, A1 + * * * + Ak )R is its own Frobenius closure. The a\u2013invariant of R is\na(R) = \u22121, and so R is F\u2013rational by [HH4, Theorem 7.12]\n4. Cyclic covers and anti\u2013canonical covers\nIf (R, m, K) is a local or graded normal ring with an ideal I of pure height one\nsatisfying I (n) \u223c\n= R, by the cyclic cover of R with respect to I, we mean the ring\nS = R \u2295 I \u2295 I (2) \u2295 * * * \u2295 I (n\u22121) .\nWe use the identification I (n) = uR to give S a natural ring structure, i.e., S is the\nring\nS = R[It, I (2) t2 , . . . , I (i) ti , . . . ]/(utn \u2212 1) = R[It, . . . , I (n\u22121) tn\u22121 ]/(utn \u2212 1).\nIf the characteristic of K is relatively prime to n, the inclusion of R in S is \u00e9tale in\ncodimension one. This holds because for a height one prime P of R, IRP = vRP\nand so SP = RP [vt]/(rv n tn \u2212 1) where r \u2208 RP is a unit. This is implicit in [Wa2].\nNote that this also shows that S is normal.\nThis construction is most interesting when I = \u03c9 is the canonical ideal of R,\nand \u03c9 is an element of finite order in the divisor class group Cl(R). In this case the\ncyclic cover of R with respect to \u03c9 is usually called the canonical cover. (As the\nreader has already discovered, we will sometimes speak of an ideal of pure height\none as an element of Cl(R), although we really mean the class it represents.)\nIf R is of dimension d, we have the isomorphism\nd\nHomR (Hm\n(\u03c9 (i) ), ER ) \u223c\n= \u03c9 (1\u2212i)\n\nwhere ER is the injective hull of the residue field K, and consequently\nHomS (H d (S), ES ) \u223c\n= HomR (H d (S), ER ) \u223c\n= S.\nmS\n\nm\n\nS is therefore Gorenstein whenever it is Cohen\u2013Macaulay. The following is a very\nuseful result of Watanabe, [Wa2, Theorem 2.7].\nTheorem 4.1. Let (R, m) \u2192 (S, n) be a finite local homomorphism of normal rings\nwhich is \u00e9tale in codimension one. Then if R is strongly F\u2013regular (F\u2013pure), so is\nS.\nAn immediate consequence of this is the following theorem:\nTheorem 4.2. Let (R, m, K) be a Cohen\u2013Macaulay normal ring of dimension\ntwo with a canonical ideal \u03c9 satisfying \u03c9 (n) \u223c\n= R for n relatively prime to the\ncharacteristic of K. Then R is (strongly) F\u2013regular if and only the cyclic cover\nS = R \u2295 \u03c9 \u2295 * * * \u2295 \u03c9 (n\u22121) is F\u2013rational.\nProof. Since \u03c9 is a torsion element of the divisor class group of R, the results of\n[Ma] or [Wi] show that F\u2013regularity is equivalent to strong F\u2013regularity. If R is F\u2013\nregular, Theorem 4.1 then shows that S is F\u2013regular and so is certainly F\u2013rational.\nFor the converse, since S is of dimension two our earlier discussion proves that S\n\n\fDEFORMATION OF F-PURITY AND F-REGULARITY\n\n7\n\nis Gorenstein, and consequently is F\u2013regular. The ring R, being a direct summand\nof S, is then F\u2013regular.\n\u0003\nWe next consider the case when the canonical ideal \u03c9 of the Cohen\u2013Macaulay\nnormal ring (R, m, K) is not necessarily of finite order in the divisor class group\nCl(R). In this case, we construct the anti\u2013canonical cover S by taking an ideal I of\npure height one, which is the inverse of \u03c9 in Cl(R) and forming the symbolic Rees\nring\nS = \u2295i\u22650 I (i) ti .\nNote that symbolic Rees rings in general need not be Noetherian. However there\nis a theorem of Watanabe which is very useful when the ring is indeed Noetherian,\n[Wa3, Theorem 0.1].\nTheorem 4.3. Let (R, m, K) be a normal ring and I an ideal of pure height one,\nwhich is the inverse of \u03c9 in Cl(R). Let S = \u2295i\u22650 I (i) ti be the anti\u2013canonical cover\nas above. Then if S is Noetherian, R is strongly F\u2013regular (F\u2013pure) if and only if\nS is strongly F\u2013regular (F\u2013pure).\nNote that if S as above is Noetherian and Cohen\u2013Macaulay, then it is Gorenstein.\nThis can be inferred from a local cohomology calculation in [Wa3], and is also\n[GHNV, Theorem 4.8].\n5. Deformation\nWe now consider the question whether strong F\u2013regularity deforms for local\nrings, i.e., if R/xR is strongly F\u2013regular for some nonzerodivisor x \u2208 m, then is\nR strongly F\u2013regular? It is known that F\u2013rationality deforms, [HH3, Theorem 4.2\n(h)], and our work makes use of this in an essential way.\nTheorem 5.1. Let (R, m, K) be a normal local ring such that if I is an ideal of\npure height one representing the inverse of \u03c9 in Cl(R), then the symbolic powers\nI (i) satisfy the Serre condition S3 for all i \u2265 0 and the anti\u2013canonical cover S =\n\u2295i\u22650 I (i) ti is Noetherian.\nIf R/xR is strongly F\u2013regular for some nonzerodivisor x \u2208 m, then R is also\nstrongly F\u2013regular.\nProof. We may, if necessary, change I to ensure that xR is not one of its minimal\nprimes. Since we have assumed that I (i) is S3 , the natural maps give us isomorphisms (I/xI)(i) \u223c\n= I (i) /xI (i) . Hence\n\u223c R/xR \u2295 (I/xI) \u2295 (I/xI)(2) \u2295 * * *\nS/xS =\nserves as an anti\u2013canonical cover for R/xR. Theorem 4.3 now shows that S/xS is\nstrongly F\u2013regular, and so is also Cohen\u2013Macaulay. Hence S is Cohen\u2013Macaulay\nand therefore Gorenstein. As F\u2013rationality deforms and S/xS is strongly F\u2013regular,\nwe get that S is F\u2013rational. However S is Gorenstein, and so is actually strongly\nF\u2013regular. Finally, R is a direct summand of S and so is strongly F\u2013regular.\n\u0003\nWe next specialize to the case when R has a canonical ideal which is a torsion\nelement of Cl(R). Note that the work of [AKM] already shows that F\u2013regularity\ndeforms in this setting, but we believe it is still interesting to examine deformation\nfrom the point of view of cyclic covers. Recall that we do not need to distinguish\nbetween F\u2013regularity and strong F\u2013regularity in this case. Our previous result\n\n\f8\n\nANURAG K. SINGH\n\nneeded the rather strong hypothesis that the symbolic powers I (i) are S3 , but in\nthis case it turns out that this hypothesis is equivalent to the F\u2013regularity of R, at\nleast when the characteristic p is \"sufficiently large.\"\nTheorem 5.2. Let (R, m, K) be a normal local ring, where K is a field of characteristic p, such that the canonical ideal \u03c9 of R is of finite order in Cl(R), and\nR/xR is F\u2013regular for some nonzerodivisor x \u2208 m.\nIf the symbolic powers \u03c9 (i) satisfy the Serre condition S3 , then R is F\u2013regular.\nThe converse is also true provided p does not divide the order of \u03c9 in Cl(R).\nProof. We choose an ideal I of pure height one which gives an inverse for \u03c9 in Cl(R)\nsuch that xR is not one of the minimal primes of I. Since \u03c9 is of finite order in\nCl(R), so is its inverse I, and the anti\u2013canonical cover S = \u2295i\u22650 I (i) ti is certainly\nNoetherian. The symbolic powers I (i) are isomorphic to some symbolic powers\n\u03c9 (j) , and consequently satisfy the condition S3 , by which we can conclude that R\nis F\u2013regular from the previous theorem. For the converse, since R is F\u2013regular, by\nTheorem 4.2 so is the cyclic cover S = R \u2295 I \u2295 I (2) \u2295 * * * \u2295 I (n\u22121) where n is the\norder of I in Cl(R). Hence the summands I (i) are, in fact, Cohen\u2013Macaulay.\n\u0003\n6. Two dimensional graded rings\nLet (R, m, K) be a graded ring where m is the homogeneous maximal ideal.\nWe shall follow the notation of Goto and Watanabe in [GW]. We recall that the\nd\nhighest local cohomology module Hm\n(R) of R, where dim R = d may be identified\nwith lim R/(xt1 , . . . xtd ) where x1 , . . . , xd is a system of parameters for R and the\n\u2212\u2192\nmaps are induced by multiplication by x1 . . . xd . If R is Cohen\u2013Macaulay, these\nd\nmaps are injective. Hm\n(R) has the natural structure of a graded R\u2013module, where\nPd\nt\nt\ndeg[r + (x1 , . . . xd )] = deg r \u2212 i=1 xi , when r and the xi are taken to be forms.\nd\nWith this grading on Hm\n(R), we define the a\u2013invariant of R to be the highest\nd\ninteger a such that [Hm (R)]a is nonzero, see [GW].\nIn general, for graded R\u2013modules M and N , we may define the graded R\u2013module\nHom(M, N ), where [Hom(M, N )]i is the abelian group consisting of all graded R\u2013\nlinear homomorphisms from M to N (i) where the convention for the grading shift\nis [N (i)]j = [N ]i+j for all j \u2208 Z. This gives Hom(M, N ) a natural structure as a\ngraded R\u2013module. The injective hull of K in the category of graded R\u2013modules\nis E R (K) = Hom(R, K). Consequently for all graded R\u2013modules M , we have\nd\nHom(M, E R (K)) = Hom(M, K). With this notation, \u03c9 = Hom(Hm\n(R), K) is a\nd\ngraded canonical module for R. Note that since \u03c9 = Hom(Hm (R), K), we have\n\u03c9 = \u2295i\u2265\u2212a [\u03c9]i .\n\u223c R(a), the isomorphism now being\nIf R is Gorenstein, it is easy to see that \u03c9 =\na graded isomorphism.\nIf R has a graded canonical module \u03c9 satisfying \u03c9 (n) = uR, set k = (deg u)/n.\nWe may construct a graded cyclic cover S as\nS = R[\u03c9t, . . . , \u03c9 (n\u22121) tn\u22121 ]/(utn \u2212 1)\nwhere we set deg t = \u2212k. The ring S has a (1/n)Z grading, and it can be verified\nthat this is in fact a (1/n)Z\u22650 grading. Consequently S may be graded by the\nnonnegative integers, and results holding for such gradings do apply here. We next\nshow that a(S) = \u2212k.\n\n\fDEFORMATION OF F-PURITY AND F-REGULARITY\n\n9\n\nNote that we have a graded isomorphism\n\u223c R \u2295 \u03c9(k) \u2295 \u03c9 (2) (2k) \u2295 * * * \u2295 \u03c9 (n\u22121) (nk \u2212 k).\nS=\nd\n(\u03c9 (i) ), ER ) \u223c\nUsing the fact that Hom(Hm\n= \u03c9 (1\u2212i) , we get the graded isomorphisms\n\u03c9S \u223c\n= Hom(H d (S), K)\nm\n\n\u223c\n= \u03c9 \u2295 R(\u2212k) \u2295 \u03c9 (\u22121) (\u22122k) \u2295 * * * \u2295 \u03c9 (2\u2212n) )(k \u2212 nk)\n\u223c\n= [\u03c9(k) \u2295 R \u2295 \u03c9 (\u22121) (\u2212k) \u2295 * * * \u2295 \u03c9 (2\u2212n) (2k \u2212 nk)](\u2212k)\n\u223c\n= [\u03c9(k) \u2295 R \u2295 \u03c9 (n\u22121) (nk \u2212 k) \u2295 * * * \u2295 \u03c9 (2) (2k)](\u2212k)\n\u223c\n= S(\u2212k).\nWe can conclude from this that a(S) = \u2212k.\nWe next recall a result of Fedder, [Fe2, Theorem 2.10].\nLet (R, m, K) be a graded ring over a perfect field K. Then S \u2286 derK R is said\nto be D\u2013complete if for every element a \u2208 R with D(a) = 0 for all D \u2208 S, we have\nD(a) = 0 for all D \u2208 derK R. If S is a D\u2013complete set of homogeneous derivations,\nwe set\ndS (R) = sup{deg(D) : D \u2208 S}.\nFedder's Theorem then is:\nTheorem 6.1. Let (R, m, K) be a graded two dimensional normal ring over a\nperfect field K. Assume that the characteristic p of K satisfies dS (R) < p for some\nD\u2013complete set S of homogeneous derivations. Then R is F\u2013rational if and only if\nit has a negative a\u2013invariant.\nThere is a corresponding result in characteristic zero, [Fe2, Theorem 3.6].\nTheorem 6.2. Let (R, m, K) be a graded two dimensional normal ring where K is\na field of characteristic zero. Then R is F\u2013rational if and only if it has a negative\na\u2013invariant.\nWe are now in a position to combine this idea with the theory of cyclic covers\nto get the following result:\nTheorem 6.3. Let (R, m, K) be a graded two dimensional normal ring over a\nperfect field K of characteristic p. Assume that dS (R) < p for some D\u2013complete\nset S of homogeneous derivations. If n is the order of the graded canonical module\n\u03c9 in the graded divisor class group of R, also assume that n and p are relatively\nprime, and let \u03c9 (n) = uR. Then R is F\u2013regular if and only if deg u > 0.\nProof. Consider the graded cyclic cover S = R[\u03c9t, . . . , \u03c9 (n\u22121) tn\u22121 ]/(utn \u2212 1). We\nobserved in Theorem 4.2 that R is F\u2013regular if and only if S is F\u2013rational. By the\nabove result of Fedder, this holds if and only is a(S) < 0. But a(S) = \u2212(deg u)/n\nand so R is F\u2013regular if and only deg u > 0.\n\u0003\n\u0003\nThe characteristic 0 version follows similarly.\nTheorem 6.4. Let (R, m, K) be a graded two dimensional normal ring over a field\nK of characteristic 0. Let n be the order of the graded canonical module \u03c9 in the\ngraded divisor class group of R and \u03c9 (n) = uR. Then R is F\u2013regular if and only if\ndeg u > 0.\n\n\f10\n\nANURAG K. SINGH\n\nExample 6.5. Let R = K[t, t4 x, t4 x\u22121 , t4 (x + 1)\u22121 ] where K is a field of characteristic p which we assume to be a suitably large prime. This is a ring which is\nF\u2013rational but not F\u2013pure, see [HH4, Wa2]. By mapping a polynomial ring onto\nit, we may write R as\nR = K[T, U, V, W ]/(T 8 \u2212 U V, T 4 (V \u2212 W ) \u2212 V W, U (V \u2212 W ) \u2212 T 4 W ).\nThis is graded by setting the weights of t, u, v and w to be 1, 4, 4 and 4 respectively.\nWe shall see that R is not F\u2013regular as an application of the above results. Note\nthat with this grading we have a(R) = \u22121. A graded canonical module for R\nis \u03c9 = 1/t3 (v, w)R. It is easy to compute that \u03c9 (2) = 1/t6 (v 2 , vw, w2 )R and\n\u03c9 (3) = 1/t9 (v 2 \u2212 2vw + w2 )R. Since deg[1/t9 (v 2 \u2212 2vw + w2 )] = \u22121, Theorem 6.3\nshows that R is not F\u2013regular.\nThe cyclic cover S of R is isomorphic to K[T, Y, Z]/(T 4 + Y Z 2 \u2212 Y 2 Z) where\nthe inclusion R \u2192 S is obtained by extending the map\nu 7\u2192 yz 2 , v 7\u2192 y 3 + yz 2 \u2212 2y 2 z, w 7\u2192 z 3 + y 2 z \u2212 2yz 2 , t 7\u2192 t.\nThe ring S has a grading where the weights of t, y and z are 1, 4/3 and 4/3\nrespectively. The a\u2013invariant is a(S) = 1/3 and corresponds to the fact that S is\nnot F\u2013rational.\nExample 6.6. Let T = K[X, Y, Z]/(X 3 \u2212 Y Z(Y + Z)) where K is a field of\ncharacteristic p, assumed to be a sufficiently large prime. Let T have the obvious\ngrading where each variable has weight 1. We let R be the subring\nR = K[X, Y 3 , Y 2 Z, Y Z 2 , Z 3 ]/(X 3 \u2212 Y Z(Y + Z)).\nThis again is an example from [HH4], see also [Wa2]. With the inherited grading,\na(R) = \u22121 and so R is F\u2013rational. A graded canonical module for R is \u03c9 = (y, z)R.\nIt is easily verified that \u03c9 (2) = (y 2 , yz, z 2)R and \u03c9 (3) = R. Consequently R is not\nF\u2013regular.\nT is in fact the cyclic cover of R, under the natural inclusion. Of course, a(T ) = 0\nand T is not F\u2013rational.\nAcknowledgments\nThe author wishes to thank Mel Hochster for many valuable discussions.\nReferences\n[AKM]\n\nI. Aberbach, M. Katzman and B.
