In the end we pose similar\nproblems for groups generated by powers of n \u2265 3 twists and give a partial\nresult.\nAMS Classification 57M07; 20F38, 57N05\nKeywords Mapping class group, Dehn twist, multi-twist, pseudo-Anosov,\nlantern relation\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn a meeting of the American Mathematical Society in Ann Arbor, MI in March\n2002, John McCarthy posed the following question: Suppose a collection of\nsimple closed curves satisfy the lantern relation (see Figure 3) algebraically. Is\nit true that they must form a lantern, as in the same figure, given the same\ncommutativity conditions? In this article we consider groups that are generated\nby two multi-twists and give conditions that guarantee the group is free or\ndoes not contain an accidental multi-twist. This will, in particular, answer\nMcCarthy's question to the affirmative (see Theorem 6.4).\nTo make this precise, let S be an oriented surface, possibly with punctures. For\nthe isotopy class of1 a simple closed curve c on S let Tc denote the right-handed\nDehn twist about c. Let (c1 , c2 ) denote the minimum geometric intersection\nnumber of isotopy classes of 1-sub-manifolds c1 , c2 . By M(S) we denote the\n1\n\nWe will usually drop the phrase \"isotopy class of\" in the rest of this paper for\nbrevity, as all curves are considered up to isotopy.\nc Geometry & Topology Publications\n\n\f1156\n\nHessam Hamidi-Tehrani\n\nmapping class group of S , i.e, the group of homeomorphisms of S which permute the punctures, up to isotopies fixing the punctures.\nThe free group on n generators will be denoted by Fn .\nLet A = {a1 , * * * , ak } be a collection of non-parallel, non-trivial, pairwise disjoint simple closed curves. For any integers m1 , ..., mk , we call TA = Tamk k * * * Tam1 1\na multi-twist. If, furthermore, all mi > 0, we call TA a positive multi-twist. We\nwill study the group generated by two positive multi-twists in detail. We will\ngive explicit conditions which imply hTA , TB i \u223c\n= F2 (see Theorem 3.2). For a\ngroup hTa , Tb i generated by two Dehn twists, we give a complete description of\nelements: We determine which elements are multi-twists, and which elements\nare pseudo-Anosov restricted to the subsurface which is a regular neighborhood\nof a \u222a b (see Theorems 3.5, 3.9, and 3.10). A mapping class f is called pseudoAnosov if f n (c) 6= c (up to isotopy) for all non-trivial simple closed curves c\nand n > 0. Let A = {a1 , a2 , ..., an } be a set of non-parallel, non-trivial simple\nclosed curves on S . The surface filled by A, denoted by SA , is a regular neighborhood N of a1 \u222a * * * \u222a an together with the components of S \\ N which are\ndiscs with 0 or 1 puncture, assuming that ai 's are drawn as geodesics of some\nconstant-curvature metric. SA is well-defined independent of chosen metric [6].\nWe say that A fills up S if SA = S .\nDefinition 1.1 A word w = Tcn11 * * * Tcnkk is called a cyclically-reduced word if\nc1 6= ck . For such a word w, define supp(w) = S{c1 ,*** ,ck } . Then we say w is\nrelatively pseudo-Anosov if the restriction of the map w is pseudo-Anosov in\nM(U ), for all components U of supp(w) which are not annuli. If g = hwh\u22121\n(as words) with w cyclically-reduced, define supp(g) = h(supp(w)). Then\ndefine g to be relatively pseudo-Anosov in the same way as above.\nIn the above, the equation g = hwh\u22121 is an equation of words, not elements, otherwise one can easily give examples where the definition breaks\ndown. To show that the above definition is well-defined, note that if w =\nTcn11 * * * Tcnkk is such that c1 = ck but n1 6= \u2212nk , then one can write w =\n1 = T \u2212nk w \u2032\u2032 T nk , where w \u2032 , w \u2032\u2032 are both cyclically reduced. Notice\nTcn11 w\u2032 Tc\u2212n\nc1\nc1\n1\nn\nthat Tc1 (S{c1 ,*** ,ck\u22121} ) = S{c1 ,*** ,ck\u22121} for all n and so supp(w) = {c1 , * * * , ck\u22121 }.\nAlso note that a power of a Dehn twist Tcni i is a relatively pseudo-Anosov word\nsince its support is an annulus. Similarly a multi-twist is relatively pseudoAnosov as well. A group \u0393 with given set of multi-twist generators is relatively\npseudo-Anosov if every reduced word in generators of \u0393 is relatively pseudoAnosov.\nAlgebraic & Geometric Topology, Volume 2 (2002)\n\n\fGroups generated by positive multi-twists\n\n1157\n\nIntuitively, a group \u0393 generated by multi-twists is relatively pseudo-Anosov if\nno word in generators of \u0393 has \"unexpected reducibility\".\nIt should be noticed that in the case of two curves a, b filling up a closed surface\nthis was done by Thurston as a method to construct pseudo-Anosov elements;\ni.e., he showed that hTa , Tb i is free and consists of pseudo-Anosov elements\nbesides powers of conjugates of the generators [4]. Our methods are completely\ndifferent and elementary, and are only based on how the geometric intersection\nbehaves under Dehn twists.\nOne surprising result that we find is a lantern-like relation:\n(Tb Ta )2 = T\u22021 T\u22022 T\u03b3\u22124 T\u03b3\u22124\n\u2032 ,\nwhere these curves are defined in Figures 2 and 4 (see Proposition 5.1). This\nrelation is lantern-like in the sense that the left hand side is a word in two Dehn\ntwists about intersecting curves and the right hand side is a multi-twist. We\nthen prove that this relation and the lantern relation are the only lantern-like\nrelations (Theorem 6.4).\nIn the case when n \u2265 3, we give some sufficient conditions for \u0393 = hTa1 , * * * , Tan i\nto be isomorphic to Fn . To motivate our condition, look at the case \u0393 =\nhTa1 , Ta2 , Ta3 i, and assume a3 = Ta1 (a2 ). Now Ta3 = Ta1 Ta2 Ta\u22121\n, so \u0393 \u2247 F3 .\n1\nBut notice that (a1 , a3 ) = (a1 , a2 ) and (a2 , a3 ) = (a1 , a2 )2 , by Lemma 2.1. This\nshows that the set I = {(ai , aj ) | i 6= j} is \"spread around\". It turns out that\nthis is in a sense an obstruction for \u0393 \u223c\n= Fn :\nTheorem Suppose \u0393 = hTa1 , ..., Tah i, and let m = min I and M = max I ,\nwhere I = {(ai , aj ) | i 6= j}. Then \u0393 \u223c\n= Fh if M \u2264 m2 /6.\nWe will prove a more general version of this (see Theorem 7.2).\nIt should be noticed that similar arguments have been used to prove that certain\ngroups generated by three 2 \u00d7 2 matrices are free [1, 13].\nIn Section 2 we go over basic facts about Dehn twists and geometric intersection\npairing and different kinds of ping-pong arguments we are going to use. In\nSection 3 we prove our general theorems about groups generated by two positive\nmulti-twists. In Section 4 we look at the specific case of a lantern formation.\nIn Section 5 we look at a formation which produces a lantern-like relation. In\nSection 6 we prove that the only possible lantern-like relations are the ones\ngiven in Theorem 6.1. In Section 7 we prove a theorem on groups generated by\nn Dehn twists. In Section 8 we pose some questions that are of similar flavor.\nAlgebraic & Geometric Topology, Volume 2 (2002)\n\n\f1158\n\nHessam Hamidi-Tehrani\n\nRemark 1.2 After the completion of this work, the author learned that Dan\nMargalit has obtained some results on the subject of lantern relation using\nthe action of the mapping class group on homology [12]. Also notice that\nTheorem 6.1 here answers the first question in [12, Section 7].\n\n2\n\nBasics\n\nFor two isotopy classes of closed 1-sub-manifolds a, b of S let (a, b) denote\ntheir geometric intersection number. For a set of closed 1-sub-manifolds A =\n{a1 , ..., an } and a simple closed curve x put\n||x||A =\n\nn\nX\n\n(x, ai ).\n\ni=1\n\nFor a non-trivial simple closed curve let Ta be the (right-handed) Dehn twist\nin curve a. The following lemma is proved in [4].\nLemma 2.1 For simple closed curves a, x, b, and n \u2265 0,\n|(Ta\u00b1n (x), b) \u2212 n(x, a)(a, b)| \u2264 (x, b).\n\nLet a = {a1 , ..., ak } be a collection of distinct, mutually disjoint non-trivial\nisotopy classes of simple closed curves. For integers ni > 0, the mapping class\nTa = Tan11 * * * Tankk is called a positive multi-twist. We also have the following\nlemma:\nLemma 2.2 For a positive multi-twist Ta = Tan11 * * * Tankk , 1-sub-manifolds x, b\nand n \u2208 Z,\nk\nX\nn\nni (x, ai )(ai , b)| \u2264 (x, b).\n|(Ta (x), b) \u2212 |n|\ni=1\n\nFor a proof see [8, Lemma 4.2]. The statement of that lemma has the expression |n| \u2212 2 instead of |n| above. Using the assumption that all ni are\npositive, the same proof goes through to prove the improved statement given\nhere. Alternatively, a proof can be found in [4, Expos\u00e9 4].\nThe classic ping-pong argument was used first by Klein [11]. We give two\nversions here which will be applied in Section 3. The group \u0393 can be a general\ngroup. The notation \u0393 = hf1 , ..., fn i means that the group \u0393 is generated by\nelements f1 , ..., fn .\nAlgebraic & Geometric Topology, Volume 2 (2002)\n\n\fGroups generated by positive multi-twists\n\n1159\n\nLemma 2.3 (Ping-pong) Let \u0393 = hf1 , ..., fn i, n \u2265 2. Suppose \u0393 acts on a set\nX . Assume that there are n non-empty mutually disjoint subsets X1 , * * * , Xn\nof X such that fi\u00b1k (\u222aj6=i Xj ) \u2282 Xi , for all 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n and k > 0. Then \u0393 \u223c\n= Fn .\nProof First notice that a non-empty reduced word of form w = f1\u2217 fi\u2217 * * * fj\u2217 f1\u2217\n(*'s are non-zero integers) is not the identity because w(X2 ) \u2229 X2 \u2282 X1 \u2229 X2 =\n\u2205. But any reduced word in f1\u00b11 , * * * , fn\u00b11 is conjugate to a w of the above\nform.\nLemma 2.4 (Tower ping-pong) Let \u0393 be a group generated by f1 , * * * , fn .\nSuppose \u0393 acts on a set X , and there is a function ||.|| : X \u2192 R\u22650 , with\nthe following properties: There are n non-empty mutually disjoint subsets\nX1 , * * * , Xn of X such that fi\u00b1k (X \\ Xi ) \u2282 Xi and for any x \u2208 X \\ Xi , we have\n||fi\u00b1k (x)|| > ||x|| for all k > 0. Then \u0393 \u223c\n= Fn . Moreover, the action of every\ng \u2208 \u0393 which is not conjugate to some power of some fi on X has no periodic\npoints.\nProof Any non-empty reduced word in f1\u2217 , ..., fn\u2217 (*'s denote non-zero integers)\nis conjugate to a reduced word w = f1\u2217 * * * f1\u2217 . To show that w 6= id notice that\nif x1 \u2208 X \\ X1 , then w(x1 ) \u2208 X1 , therefore w(x1 ) 6= x1 . To prove the last\nassertion, notice that it's enough to show the claim with \"periodic points\"\nreplaced by \"fixed points\". Any element of \u0393 which is not conjugate to a power\nof some fi is conjugate to some reduced word of the form w = fj\u2217 * * * fi\u2217 with\ni 6= j . Now suppose w(x) = x. First assume x \u2208 X \\ Xi . Then by assumption\n||w(x)|| > ||x|| which is impossible. If on the other hand, x \u2208 Xi and w(x) = x,\nthen w\u22121 (x) = fi\u2217 * * * fj\u2217 (x) = x.

Consider supp(\u0393) = Sa\u222ab . If supp(\u0393) is not a\nconnected surface, and U is one of its components, we can look at the group\n\u0393|U . Certainly if \u0393|U \u223c\n= F2 then \u0393 \u223c\n= F2 as well. Notice that an element\ng|U \u2208 \u0393|U is obtained by dropping the twists in curves which can be isotoped\noff U from g \u2208 \u0393. So let us characterize the groups \u0393 such that supp(\u0393) is\nconnected.\nRemark 3.3 Let \u0393 = hTa , Tb i where Ta , Tb are multi-twists.

The group \u0393 \u223c\n= F2 if\nmi (ai , b) \u2265 2 and nj (a, bj ) \u2265 2 for all i, j , by Theorem 3.2. To understand\nthe other cases, without loss of generality assume that m1 (a1 , b) = 1. By\nRemark 3.3 (ai , b) > 0 for all i and (a, bj ) > 0 for all j since supp(\u0393) is\nconnected.\nNow put \u03bb = 2 in Lemma 3.1. Clearly the condition mi (ai , b) \u2265 2\u03bb\u22121 = 1 is\nsatisfied, so if nj (a, bj ) \u2265 2\u03bb = 4 for all j , using Lemma 2.3 we get \u0393 \u223c\n= F2 .\nOne can completely answer the question \"when is a group generated by powers\nof Dehn twists isomorphic to F2 ?\", as follows:\nTheorem 3.5 Let A = {a, b} be a set of two simple closed curves on a surface\nS and m, n > 0. Put \u0393 = hTam , Tbn i. The following conditions are equivalent:\n(i) \u0393 \u223c\n= F2 .\n(ii) Either (a, b) \u2265 2, or (a, b) = 1 and\n{m, n} \u2208\n/ {{1}, {1, 2}, {1, 3}}.\nProof By Theorem 3.4, (ii) implies (i). To prove (i) implies (ii), we must show\nthat for (a, b) = 1, the groups hTa , Tbn i are not free for n = 1, 2, 3.\nLet us denote Ta by a and Tb by b for brevity. We know that (ab)6 commutes\nwith both a and b, (see Figure 1; for a proof of this relation see [9].) so the\ncase n = 1 is non-free. Also, notice the famous braid relation aba = bab (see,\nfor instance [9]). Now consider the case n = 2.

In the rest of this section we answer the question \"which words in hTa , Tb i are relatively pseudo-Anosov?\"(see\nDefinition 1.1).\nAn element f \u2208 M(S) is called pure [8] if for any simple closed curve c,\nf n (c) = c implies f (c) = c. In other words, by Thurston classification [4], there\nis a finite (possibly empty) set C = {c1 , * * * , ck } of disjoint simple closed curves\nci such that f (ci ) = ci and f keeps all components of S \\(c1 \u222a* * *\u222ack ) invariant,\nand is either identity or pseudo-Anosov on each such component. A subgroup\nof M(S) is called pure if all elements of it are pure. Ivanov showed that M(S)\ncontains finite-index pure subgroups, namely, ker(M(S) \u2192 H1 (S, Z/mZ)) for\nm \u2265 3 [8]. A relatively pseudo-Anosov word induces a pure element of the\nmapping class group.\nTheorem 3.7 For two positive multi-twists Ta = Tam1 1 * * * Tamk k and Tb =\nTbn11 * * * Tbnl l on the surface S , the group \u0393 = hTa , Tb i is pure and relatively\npseudo-Anosov if any of the following conditions holds:\nAlgebraic & Geometric Topology, Volume 2 (2002)\n\n\f1164\n\nHessam Hamidi-Tehrani\n\n(i) For all i, mi (ai , b) \u2265 2 and for all j , nj (a, bj ) \u2265 3.\n\n(ii) For all i, mi (ai , b) \u2265 3 and for all j , nj (a, bj ) \u2265 2.\n\n(iii) For all i, mi (ai , b) \u2265 1 and for all j , nj (a, bj ) \u2265 5.\n(iv) For all i, mi (ai , b) \u2265 5 and for all j , nj (a, bj ) \u2265 1.\n\nProof We use Lemma 2.4 together with Lemma 3.1 (ii),(iv). First assume that\n\u03bb = 1 + \u01eb where \u01eb is a small irrational number. Notice that X = Na,\u03bb \u222a Nb,\u03bb\u22121 .\nIf all mi (ai , b) \u2265 2 > 2\u03bb\u22121 and ni (a, bi ) \u2265 3 > 2\u03bb, one can use Tower pingpong to show that if a simple closed curve intersects supp(\u0393) then it cannot be\nmapped to itself by any element of \u0393 except conjugates of powers of Ta and\nTb , which are already known to be pure and relatively pseudo-Anosov. This\nproves (i) (A relatively pseudo-Anosov word induces a pure element). Similarly\nby using \u03bb = 1 \u2212 \u01eb, \u01eb \u2208 R \\ Q in Lemma 3.1 (ii),(iv), we get (ii). To get\nparts (iii),(iv) we can set \u03bb = 2 + \u01eb and \u03bb = 1/2 \u2212 \u01eb respectively and argue\nsimilarly.\nThis in particular proves:\nCorollary 3.8 (Thurston [4]) If a, b are two simple closed curves, which fill\nup the closed surface S of genus g \u2265 2, then hTa , Tb i \u223c\n= F2 and all elements not\nconjugate to the powers of Ta and Tb are pseudo-Anosov.\nProof If a, b fill up S we must have (a, b) \u2265 3. Now we can use Theorem 3.7.\nTheorem 3.9 Let A = {a, b} be a set of two simple closed curves on a surface\nS and m, n > 0 be integers and \u0393 = hTam , Tbn i. The following conditions are\nequivalent:\n(i) \u0393 is relatively pseudo-Anosov.\n(ii) Either (a, b) \u2265 3, or (a, b) = 2 and (m, n) 6= (1, 1), or (a, b) = 1 and\n{m, n} \u2208\n/ {{1}, {1, 2}, {1, 3}, {1, 4}, {2}}.\nProof If (a, b) \u2265 3, then \u0393 is relatively pseudo-Anosov for all m, n > 0 by\nTheorem 3.7. If (a, b) = 2 then \u0393 is relatively pseudo-Anosov if m > 1 or\nn > 1 by Theorem 3.7. We prove that if (a, b) = 2 then \u0393 = hTa , Tb i is not\nrelatively pseudo-Anosov. We consider two cases.\nAlgebraic & Geometric Topology, Volume 2 (2002)\n\n\f1165\n\nGroups generated by positive multi-twists\n\na\n\n\u22022\n\n\u22021\n\nb\n\nFigure 2: S1,2,0 and the curves a and b\n\nCase 1 (a, b) = 2 and the algebraic intersection number of a, b is \u00b12.\nIn this case both a, b can be embedded in a twice punctured torus subsurface\nof S (see Figure 2).

The\ngroups hTa , Tb i, hTa , Tb2 i and hTa , Tb3 i are not relatively pseudo-Anosov because\nthe map (Ta Tb )6 = (Ta Tb2 )4 = (Ta Tb3 )3 is in fact a Dehn twist in the boundary\nof the surface defined by a, b (see Figure 1) hence they induce the identity on\nSa,b .\nIf (a, b) = 1, then \u0393 = hTa2 , Tb2 i is not relatively pseudo-Anosov. This is because\nTb2 Ta2 has a trace of \u22122 and hence is reducible (see Remark 6.2). Similarly when\n(a, b) = 1, the maps Ta Tb4 and Ta4 Tb both have a trace of \u22122 and hence are\nreducible.\nWe saw that if a, b are two simple closed curves with (a, b) \u2265 2, a word\nw(Ta , Tb ) \u2208 hTa , Tb i is relatively pseudo-Anosov except possibly when (a, b) =\n2. In the following theorem we narrow down the search for words which are not\nrelatively pseudo-Anosov in this case.\nTheorem 3.10 Let a, b be two simple closed curves on a surface S with\n(a, b) = 2. Then a word w in Ta , Tb representing an element of hTa , Tb i is a\npure and relatively pseudo-Anosov unless possibly when w is cyclically reducible\nto a power of either Tb Ta\u22121 or Tb Ta .\nProof The proof is based on repeated application of Lemma 2.1. Clearly Ta\nand Tb are both pure and relatively pseudo-Anosov. So in what follows we\nassume that w is a cyclically reduced word of length > 1. Let X, A, Na,1 , Nb,1\nbe defined as in the beginning of this section. Let\nY = {x \u2208 X | (x, a) = (x, b)}.\nHence X is a disjoint union Na,1 \u222a Nb,1 \u222a Y .\n\nBy Lemma 3.1, we have Ta\u00b1n (Nb,1 ) \u2282 Na,1 and Tb\u00b1n (Na,1 ) \u2282 Nb,1 for all n >\n0. Moreover, for x \u2208 Nb,1 , we have ||Ta\u00b1n (x)|| > ||x|| and for x \u2208 Na,1 ,\n||Tb\u00b1n (x)|| > ||x||. By the same lemma, Ta\u00b1n (Y ) \u2282 Na,1 and Tb\u00b1n (Y ) \u2282 Nb,1\nfor all n \u2265 2 (This follows by applying the lemma to \u03bb = 1 + \u01eb and \u03bb = 1 \u2212 \u01eb,\nwhere \u01eb is a small positive number).\nLet w = Tbnk Tamk * * * Tbn1 Tam1 be a cyclically reduced word, where mi , ni 6= 0 and\nk \u2265 1. If any of mi is greater that 1 in absolute value, we can assume without\nloss of generality that |m1 | > 1, by conjugation. Therefore if x \u2208 Y \u222a Nb,1 , then\nTam1 (x) \u2208 Na,1 and hence ||wn (x)|| > ||x|| for all n > 0. Hence wn (x) 6= x for\nall integers n. If x \u2208 Na,1 , then ||w\u2212n (x)|| > ||x|| for n > 0, and so wn (x) 6= x\nAlgebraic & Geometric Topology, Volume 2 (2002)\n\n\fGroups generated by positive multi-twists\n\n1167\n\nfor all n. This shows that w is relatively pseudo-Anosov. The case where some\n|ni | > 1 follows by symmetry by replacing w with w\u22121 .\nSo let us assume that for all 1 \u2264 i \u2264 k , we have mi , ni = \u00b11. If w is not\nconjugate to a power of Tb Ta or Tb Ta\u22121 , by conjugating w we can assume\neither m1 6= m2 , or nk 6= nk\u22121 . We assume the former. The latter can be dealt\nwith similarly by symmetry and replacing w with w\u22121 . In this case the word\nw could have any of the following forms:\n(i) w = Tbnk Tamk * * * Ta Tb Ta\u22121 ,\n\n(ii) w = Tbnk Tamk * * * Ta\u22121 Tb Ta ,\n\n(iii) w = Tbnk Tamk * * * Ta Tb\u22121 Ta\u22121 ,\n(iv) w = Tbnk Tamk * * * Ta\u22121 Tb\u22121 Ta .\n\nSuppose, for example, that w = Tbnk Tamk * * * Ta Tb Ta\u22121 . As before, if x \u2208 Na,1 \u222a\nNb,1 , we get that wn (x) 6= x for all n > 0. So let us assume that x \u2208 Y . Then,\nby definition of Y , (x, a) = (x, b) = p > 0. Then we have (Ta\u22121 (x), a) = p and\nby Lemma 2.1,\n|(Ta\u22121 (x), b) \u2212 (a, b)(x, a)| \u2264 (x, b),\n\nwhich implies p \u2264 (Ta\u22121 (x), b) \u2264 3p. If p < (Ta\u22121 (x), b), then Ta\u22121 (x) \u2208 Na,1\nand so wn (x) 6= x, for all n > 0. So let us assume (Ta\u22121 (x), b) = p. Notice that\nthis implies (Tb Ta\u22121 (x), b) = p. Again by Lemma 2.1,\n|(Tb (Ta\u22121 (x)), a) \u2212 (a, b)(b, Ta\u22121 (x))| \u2264 (Ta\u22121 (x), a),\n\nwhich gives p \u2264 (Tb Ta\u22121 (x), a) \u2264 3p. Again, if p < (Tb Ta\u22121 (x), a), then\nTb Ta\u22121 (x) \u2208 Nb,1 which implies wn (x) 6= x for n > 0. Otherwise, we can further\nassume that (Tb Ta\u22121 (x), a) = p. Notice that this gives (Ta Tb Ta\u22121 (x), a) = p. At\nthis point it looks like the argument is going to go on forever, but here is a\nnew ingredient. For any mapping class f , we have the following well-known\nequation: f Tb f \u22121 = Tf (b) . In particular: Ta Tb Ta\u22121 = TTa (b) .\n\u2022 Claim (Ta (b), b) = 4\nThis follows from Lemma 2.1: |(Ta (b), b) \u2212 (b, a)(a, b)| \u2264 (b, b).\nNow by the same lemma,\n|(TTa (b) (x), b) \u2212 (Ta (b), x)(Ta (b), b)| \u2264 (x, b),\n\nwhich gives 3p \u2264 (Ta Tb Ta\u22121 (x), b) \u2264 5p, i.e., Ta Tb Ta\u22121 (x) \u2208 Na,1 , and so\nwn (x) 6= x for all n \u2265 0.

Note the\ncommutativity between the various twists.\nProposition 4.1 In the group hTa , Tb i all words are pure. All words are\nrelatively pseudo-Anosov except precisely words that are cyclically reducible to\na non-zero power of Tb Ta .\nProof The lantern relation implies:\nTa Tb = Tc\u22121 T\u22021 T\u22022 T\u22023 T\u22024 .\nThis shows that Ta Tb (and hence its conjugate Tb Ta ) is a multi-twist.

But the group hTa2 , Tc i is pure and\nrelatively pseudo-Anosov by Theorem 3.9, which shows that Ta\u22121 Tb (and hence\nits conjugate Tb Ta\u22121 ) is pure relatively pseudo-Anosov. Moreover, a, c fill the\nsame surface as a, b. Finally, we invoke Theorem 3.10.\n\n5\n\nThe case of two simple closed curves with intersection number 2 filling a twice-punctured torus\n\nLet Sg,b,n denote a surface of genus g with b boundary components and n\npunctures. Let a and b be two simple closed curves such that (a, b) = 2 and\nassume both intersections have the same sign. In this case a and b are both\nnon-separating. One can therefore assume, up to diffeomorphism that they are\nas given in Figure 2. Since the regular neighborhood of a \u222a b is homeomorphic\nto S1,2,0 , the surface filled by a, b is S1,i,j , for i, j = 0, 1, 2, i + j \u2264 2.\nAssume that S{a,b} = S1,2,0 .

By\nfollowing Figure 4 one can see that (Tb Ta )2 (\u03b3) = \u03b3 , preserving the orientation.\nSince by definition Tb Ta (\u03b3) = \u03b3 \u2032 , one also gets (Tb Ta )2 (\u03b3 \u2032 ) = \u03b3 \u2032 . Now notice\nthat \u03b3 and \u03b3 \u2032 cut up S1,2,0 into two pairs of pants. Hence (Tb Ta )2 is a multitwist in curves \u03b3, \u03b3 \u2032 , \u22021 and \u22022 .\nAlgebraic & Geometric Topology, Volume 2 (2002)\n\n\f1169\n\nGroups generated by positive multi-twists\n\na\nTa\n\u03b3\nTb\n\nb\n\nTa\n\u03b3\u2032\nTb\n\n\u03b3\n\nFigure 4: (Tb Ta )2 (\u03b3) = \u03b3 and (Tb Ta )(\u03b3) = \u03b3 \u2032\n\nProposition 5.1 With the notation in Figures 2 and 4, we have\n(Tb Ta )2 = T\u22021 T\u22022 T\u03b3\u22124 T\u03b3\u22124\n\u2032 .\nProof Since (Tb Ta )2 fixes \u22021 , \u22022 , \u03b3 and \u03b3 \u2032 , it has to be a multi-twist in these\ncurves. We consider an arc joining \u22021 to \u22022 crossing \u03b3 once as in Figure 5.\nWe apply (Tb Ta )2 to I , and the result is the same as applying T\u22021 T\u22022 T\u03b3\u22124 to I\n(again see Figure 5). Hence\n(Tb Ta )2 = T\u22021 T\u22022 T\u03b3\u22124 T\u03b3n\u2032 ,\nwhere n is to be found. One can argue by drawing another arc joining \u22021 to \u22022\npassing through \u03b3 \u2032 once, but here is a simpler way: We know that (Tb Ta )(\u03b3) =\n\u03b3 \u2032 and (Tb Ta )(\u03b3 \u2032 ) = \u03b3 (see Figure 4), so if we conjugate the above equation by\nTb Ta , we get:\nn\n(Tb Ta )2 = T\u22021 T\u22022 T\u03b3\u22124\n\u2032 T\u03b3 ,\nwhich shows that n = \u22124.\nProposition 5.2 The word Tb Ta\u22121 is relatively pseudo-Anosov.\nAlgebraic & Geometric Topology, Volume 2 (2002)\n\n\f1170\n\nHessam Hamidi-Tehrani\n\nTa\n\nI\nTb\n\nTa\n\nTb\n\n=\n\nFigure 5: The arc I , and (Tb Ta )2 (I)\n\nProof We use a \"brute force\" method to show that restricted to S = S1,0,2\n(the boundary components \u22021 , \u22022 shrunk to punctures p1 , p2 , respectively), the\nword Tb Ta\u22121 induces a pseudo-Anosov map. It is enough to show that the word\nTb\u22121 Ta is relatively pseudo-Anosov. Let f be the mapping class induced by the\nword Tb\u22121 Ta . We will find measured laminations F1 , F2 and \u03bb > 0 such that\nf (F1 ) = \u03bbF1 and f (F2 ) = \u03bb\u22121 F2 . To this end, we use the theory of measured\ntrain-tracks. For a review of these methods and the theory, see for example [5].\nConsider the polygon R obtained by cutting S open as in Figure 6. Identifying\nparallel sides of R yields back the surface S . Consider the measured train-track\n\u03c4 = \u03c4 (x, y, z) (x, y, z \u2265 0) on S defined as in Figure 7. We can calculate the\nimage f (\u03c4 ) in two steps as in Figures 8 and 9. (Remember that Dehn twists are\nright-handed.) Luckily the action of f on the space of measures on \u03c4 is linear,\nso we can easily find fixed laminations carried on \u03c4 : The matrix representing\nf on the space of measured laminations carried on \u03c4 is\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n2 3 3\n\uf8ed1 4 3\uf8f8 .\n1 1 1\nAlgebraic & Geometric Topology, Volume 2 (2002)\n\n\f1171\n\nGroups generated by positive multi-twists\n\np1\n\np2\n\np1\nII\n\nI\n\na\n\nIII\n\nIII\n\nb\n\nb\nb\n\np1\n\np2\nI\n\np1\n\nII\n\nFigure 6: The surface S1,0,2 cut-open into a polygon R\np1\n\np2\n\np1\nII\n\nI\n\ny\n\nx\n\nIII\n\nIII\n\nz\n\ny\np1\n\nx\np2\n\nI\n\nII\n\np1\n\nFigure 7: The measured train-track \u03c4 (x, y, z)\n\n\u221a\n\u221a\nThis matrix has eigenvalues 1, 3 + 10,\u221a3 \u2212 10.

Clearly sts = q and hence SL(2, Z) = ht, si. In\nthis case, a word in hTa , Tb i is pseudo-Anosov if and only if the trace of the\ncorresponding matrix has absolute value of 2 or more. Such a word is a multitwist if the corresponding matrix has trace 2.\nDefinition 6.3 A relation w(Ta , Tb ) = TC is called lantern-like if Ta , Tb are\nDehn twists, and TC is a multi-twist with C having at least 3 components.\nTheorem 6.4 The only lantern-like relations in any mapping class group are\ndescribed in Theorem 6.1.\nProof We have to only show that, if (a, b) = 1, they cannot form a lantern-like\nrelation.
