Introduction\nThe c \u2264 1 string theories, which can also be viewed as solvable models of 2D quantum\ngravity, have been solved perturbatively through their description as large N matrix models\n(see the reviews [1-3]). Originally the matrix models were considered just as 'engins' that\ngenerate planar graphs, but very soon it became clear that the matrix models are in\nprinciple able to give a qualitative picture of the non-perturbative effects1 in these lowdimensional string theories [5].\nRecent works [6-21] suggested to think of the matrix models as dual open string\ntheories in presence of D-branes and led to an interpretation of the non-perturbative phenomena in terms of open string world sheets with appropriate boundary conditions. This\ninterpretation was prepared, from the string theory side, by the remarkable works on Liouville CFT with boundary, which has been solved using conformal bootstrap methods\n[22-26]. All comparisons between the matrix and CFT approaches showed agreement and\nled further to a new proposal for the matrix description of string theories with world sheet\nsupersymmetry, type 0A and 0B theories [27-29].\nIn particular, the non-perturbative corrections (NPC) to the string partition function\nare believed to be produced by D-instantons [30]. On the string theory side, they were\nshown to be described in terms of a boundary CFT with Dirichlet boundary conditions on\nthe Liouville field, known also as ZZ branes [24]. Namely, the leading corrections are given\nby the exponents of the disk partition functions with ZZ boundary conditions [31,10,11].\nFor c < 1 minimal string theories, the leading non-perturbative effects were given\na nice geometric interpretation in terms of a complex curve describing the closed string\ntheory background [12,14]. Each point on this Riemann surface is associated with a FZZT\nbrane, which implies Neumann boundary conditions for the Liouville field [22]. The ZZ\nbranes are associated with the double points of the Riemann surface, which can be also\nthought of as vanishing A-cycles. The disk partition functions with ZZ boundary conditions\nare given by line integrals along the corresponding B-cycles.\nThe generalization of these results to c = 1 is not obvious because of the singular\ncharacter of the limit c \u2192 1 in the space of minimal string theories. In particular, the\ndouble points of the complex curve degenerate just to two singularities where all ZZ branes\nare situated. Therefore, in order to study the non-perturbative effects in c = 1 string\ntheories, it is helpful to perturb the theory with a time-dependent tachyon potential, to\nthe effect that the degeneracy of the singular points at c = 1 is lifted.\nThe integrable tachyon perturbations are those with equidistant spectrum and it is\nnatural to consider them in the context of a string theory with finite temperature. The\n1\n\nThe first systematic study of the non-perturbative effects in the simplest one-matrix model\n\nhas been done by F. David [4].\n\n1\n\n\fworld sheet description of such a theory is given by the euclidean c = 1 string theory,\ndefined by the world sheet action\nZ\nh\ni\n1\nd2 \u03c3 (\u2202\u03c7)2 + (\u2202\u03c6)2 + 2R\u0302\u03c6 + \u03bc\u03c6 e2\u03c6 + ghosts ,\n(1.1)\nSc=1 =\n4\u03c0\nin which the matter field \u03c7, or the local euclidean time coordinate of the string, is compactified:\n\u03c7 + 2\u03c0R \u2261 \u03c7.\n(1.2)\nWe are interested in the possible deformations of this theory by on-mass-shell tachyon\noperators2\nZ\nTp \u223c d2 \u03c3 eip\u03c7 e(2\u2212|p|)\u03c6\n(1.3)\nwith the allowed by the compactification (1.2) values of the momentum\npk = k/R,\n\nk = \u00b11, \u00b12, . . . .\n\n(1.4)\n\nA general such deformation is achieved by adding to the action (1.1) a term\n\u03b4S =\n\nX\n\nk6=0\n\ntk Tk/R .\n\n(1.5)\n\nWe will be mainly interested in sine-Liouville deformation, which represents a perturbation\nby the two lowest vertex operators n = \u00b11. It contains, besides the Liouville term \u03bce2\u03c6 , a\nsine-Liouville interaction\nZ\n1\n(1.6)\n\u03b4SSL = \u03bb d2 \u03c3 cos(\u03c7/R) e(2\u2212 R )\u03c6 ,\nwhere we denoted \u03bb = t1 = t\u22121 .\nThe string theory deformed by the term (1.5) has been studied using the 'holographic'\ndescription provided by the Matrix Quantum Mechanics (MQM). The first exact result,\nthe expression for the partition function for sine-Liouville deformation, was suggested by\nG. Moore in [32]. Later this result was proved and generalised in [33-35] using the fact\nthat the perturbations (1.5) behave as Toda integrable flows. The classical background\nfor given deformation is described by a complex curve whose exact form depends on the\ncoupling constants in (1.5). This curve is not the one describing the FZZT brane, but is\n2\n\nIn the compactified theory, in addition to this discrete spectrum of tachyon modes, there\n\nis a discrete set of the winding modes, or Kosterlitz\u2013Thouless vortices. In the following we will\nconsider only perturbations by tachyons; the results for perturbations by winding modes can be\nobtained by T-duality.\n\n2\n\n\fobtained from the latter by a projection that identifies an infinite number of sheets. The\nexistence of two distinct complex curves is a peculiarity of the c = 1 string theory and is\nrelated with the logarithmic singularity of the resolvent at infinity. In the c < 1 string\ntheories there is only one such curve.\nThe leading non-perturbative effects in presence of sine-Liouville deformation were\nstudied in [10,11] and later, in [13,14], where the string theory instantons were associated\nwith the double points of of the complex curve. In this paper we study the quantum\ncorrections to the leading NPC to the partition function, given by the pre-exponential\nfactors. We calculate these factors using the matrix model description of the c = 1 string\ntheory.\nWe perform the calculation by two different methods. The first method uses the fact\nthat the free energy of the perturbed theory as a function of the cosmological constant\n\u03bc and sine-Liouville coupling \u03bb satisfies Toda partial differential equation. The second\nmethod is based on the formulation of the matrix model as a system of free fermions and\nconsists in direct evaluation of the quasiclassical fermion wave functions. This method\ngives the answer for a general time-dependent background in terms of the complex curve\nassociated with it.\nWe are using the chiral formalism in which the role of canonical coordinate and momentum are played by the left and right chiral combinations x\u00b1 \u223c x \u00b1 p. The advantage of\nthis formalism is the exact bosonization of the fermion operators. Using the bosonization\nwe interpret our results in terms of (target-space) CFT correlation functions. We show\nthat the subleading corrections are related to the two-point correlation function of the\nbosonic field. Unlike the bosonization formulae for other matrix models for non-critical\nstrings [36,15,37], here we have two chiral fields associated with the left and right moving\ntachyons. The resulting bosonic field theory can be viewed also as a boundary CFT, in\nwhich the boundary condition relates the left and right fields, see e.g. [38,39] for similar\nstatement for the normal matrix model. Since our bosonic field describes chiral excitations\nabove the Fermi sea, its correlation functions do not have direct interpretation in terms of\nthe usual FZZT branes. Nevertheless, the one-point functions, evaluated at the singular\npoints of the complex curve, reproduce the disk partition function on ZZ branes, as is the\ncase in the c = 0 matrix model [15,16].\n\n2. Time-dependent backgrounds in Matrix Quantum Mechanics\n2.1. The singlet sector of MQM as a system of free fermions\nThe matrix quantum mechanics can be viewed as reduction of a two-dimensional U (N )\ngauge theory to one dimension, and involves one gauge field Aij and one scalar field Xij ,\nboth hermitian N \u00d7 N matrices. The modern interpretation of the matrix path integral is\nas an effective open string theory on N D0 branes [6-9]. The matrix variable X describes\n3\n\n\fthe open-string tachyon field in presence of the N D0 branes, and only effect of the gauge\nfield is that it projects onto the singlet sector. The theory is described by the action\nS=\n\nZ\n\n\u0001\ndt Tr P \u2207A X \u2212 21 (P2 \u2212 X2 ) + \u03bcN ,\n\n(2.1)\n\nwhere \u2207A X = \u2202t X \u2212 i[A, X] is the covariant time derivative. The cosmological constant\n\u03bc is introduced as a chemical potential for the size N of the matrices, which is treated as\na dynamical variable.\nThe closed c = 1 string theory appears as a theory of collective excitations of the\nmatrix variables. The momentum modes arise as collective excitations of the matrix Xij ,\nwhile the winding modes are collective excitations of Aij . The vertex operators (1.3) can\nbe represented in the matrix model by3 [41]\nTp \u2194\n\n(\n\ne\u2212pt Tr X|p|\n+\ne\u2212pt Tr X|p|\n\u2212\n\nif p > 0\nif p < 0,\n\n(2.2)\n\nwhere X+ and X\u2212 are the chiral combinations of the matrix coordinate and momentum\nX\u00b1 =\n\nX\u00b1P\n\u221a .\n2\n\n(2.3)\n\nThe theory simplifies significantly if formulated directly in terms of the chiral variables\nX\u00b1 [35]. In the new variables the action (2.1) becomes\nS=\n\nZ\n\ndt Tr X+ \u2207A X\u2212 + X+ X\u2212 + \u03bcN\n\n\u0001\n\n(2.4)\n\nso that the new Hamiltonian is linear in the canonical coordinates and momenta.\nIn the singlet sector, characterized by absence of winding modes, the matrix model\nis described by a system of free fermions whose phase space is the spectral plane (x+ , x\u2212 )\nof the two commuting matrices X+ and X\u2212 . The fermions are governed by a one-body\nHamiltonian\n\u01240 = \u2212 12 (x\u0302+ x\u0302\u2212 + x\u0302\u2212 x\u0302+ ),\n(2.5)\n3\n\nWhen comparing the results in CFT and matrix model descriptions, we encounter the old\n\nproblem of operator mixing [40]. This problem occurs because the correlation functions are\nintegrated over the world sheet and the integrals have contributions from the coinciding points\nand a special prescription is needed to distinguish two tachyons with momenta p1 and p2 close to\neach other from a single tachyon with momentum p1 + p2 . This ambiguity possibly leads to an\nanalytic redefinition of the couplings when passing to the matrix model description.\n\n4\n\n\fwhere\n[x\u0302+ , x\u0302\u2212 ] = \u2212i.\n\n(2.6)\n\nThe one-particle wave functions in \"x+ \" and \"x\u2212 \" representations are related by Fourier\ntransformation \u015c:\nZ\n1\n\u03c8\u2212 (x\u2212 ) = [\u015c\u03c8+ ](x\u2212 ) \u2261 \u221a2\u03c0 dx+ eix+ x\u2212 \u03c8+ (x+ ).\n(2.7)\nThe one-body Hamiltonian has continuous spectrum and is diagonalized, in the x+\nand x\u2212 representations, by the functions\nE\n\u03c8\u00b1\n(x\u00b1 ) =\n\n\u221a1\n2\u03c0\n\n1\n\n\u00b1iE\u2212 2\nx\u00b1\n,\n\nE \u2208 R.\n\n(2.8)\n\nThe wave functions (2.8) have branch points at x\u00b1 = 0 and therefore are defined unambiguously only for x\u00b1 > 0. It is useful to consider them either as multivalued meromorphic\nfunctions of the complex variables x\u00b1 , or as analytic functions of log x\u00b1 .\nWe will restrict ourselves to the case of a theory with one Fermi sea on the right of\nthe top of the potential, in which the wave functions are supported, up to exponentially\nE\nsmall terms, by the positive axis. Therefore we will define \u03c8+E and \u03c8\u2212\nby (2.8) along\nthe positive axis, and their values along the negative axis will be obtained by analytic\ncontinuation from the upper and lower half plane, respectively.4 The wave functions (2.8)\nare orthonormal with respect to the scalar product\nZ \u221e\n(2.9)\n(f, g) =\ndx\u00b1 f (x\u00b1 ) g(x\u00b1 ),\n0\n\nwhere the integration with respect to the chiral phase space coordinates is performed only\nalong the positive real axis, x\u00b1 > 0. The restriction of the phase space to x\u00b1 > 0 can\nbe intuitively understood as follows. The wave function describes the system at given\nmoment of time and its form for other moments is obtained by applying the evolution\noperator eit\u0124 . On the other hand, since the evolution operator shifts arg(x\u00b1 ) by \u2213it, the\nanalytic continuation of the wave functions (2.8) off the positive axis can be viewed as the\nresult of evolution in imaginary time direction.\nThe Fourier transformation \u015c defined by (2.7) gives the reflection part of the scattering\noperator, relating the incoming leftmovers and outgoing rightmovers. It acts diagonally\non the wave functions (2.8):\nE\n\u015c \u03c8+E = ei\u03c60 (E) \u03c8\u2212\n,\n(2.10)\nwith\nei\u03c60 (E) =\n\n\u221a1\n2\u03c0\n\n\u03c0\n\ne\u2212 2 (E\u2212i/2) \u0393(iE + 1/2).\n\n(2.11)\n\nThe reflection phase \u03c60 (E), is the same as the one calculated using the standard xrepresentation of the upside-down oscillator in [42,2]. It has an exponentially small imaginary part\n(2.12)\nIm \u03c60 (\u2212\u03bc) = 21 log(1 + e\u22122\u03c0\u03bc ),\nwhich determines the flow of particles under the potential barrier.\n4\n\nIn a theory with two Fermi seas one should introduce a second set wave functions, which are\nE\nobtained from \u03c8\u00b1\nby reflection x\u00b1 \u2192 \u2212x\u00b1 . For details see the appendix of [35].\n\n5\n\n\f2.2. Partition function and density of states\nThe string theory compactified at time interval \u03b2 = 2\u03c0R is described by the grand canonical\nensemble of fermions at finite temperature 1/\u03b2 and chemical potential \u03bc. If Z(\u03bc) is the\npartition function of the ensemble of fermions, then the free energy F = log Z is given by\nF (\u03bc) =\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\u2212\u221e\n\n\u0011\n\u0010\ndE \u03c1(E) log 1 + e\u2212\u03b2(\u03bc+E) ,\n\n(2.13)\n\nwhere \u03c1(E) is the density of states related to the phase \u03c6(E) of the fermion scattering by\n\u03c1(E) =\n\nlog \u039b\n1 d\u03c6(E)\n\u2212\n.\n2\u03c0\n2\u03c0 dE\n\n(2.14)\n\nThe non-trivial part of the density adds to a constant cut-off dependent term, where the\ncut-off \u039b is introduced as the volume of the (x+ , x\u2212 ) phase space. We remind the derivation\nof this relation in Appendix A, where we also recall the derivation of the relation between\nthe free energy and the scattering phase\n\u2202\n\n\u03bc\n* F (\u03bc) = \u03c6(\u2212\u03bc).\n2 sin 2R\n\n(2.15)\n\nAs we know from [3], this last identity allows to evaluate all tachyon correlation functions\nin the compactified theory, once their counterparts in the theory with R = \u221e are known.\nThe identities (2.14) and (2.15) hold for any Fermi system at finite temperature and,\nin particular, after an arbitrary time-dependent perturbation that preserves the singlet\nsector. Thus all the information about the system is contained in the phase of fermionic\nscattering \u03c6(E) as a function of the coupling constants {tk } associated with the tachyon\noperators (2.2).\nLet us recall the explicit expressions for the stationary background, where all tk = 0.\nThen the phase \u03c60 (E) = \u03c6(E){tk =0} is given by (2.11) and the free energy itself is calculated\nby inverting the finite-difference operator in (2.15). The latter is diagonalized by the\nFourier transformation\nZ \u221e\ni\nds ei\u03bcs\n\u03c60 (\u2212\u03bc) = \u2212\n,\n(2.16)\n2 \u039b1 s sinh 2s\nwhere we reintroduced the cut-off \u039b. Then (2.15) yields5\nF (\u03bc){tk =0}\n5\n\n1\n=\u2212\n4\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n1\n\u039b\n\nei\u03bcs\nds\ns .\ns sinh 2s sinh 2R\n\n(2.17)\n\nUp to cut-off-dependent terms this integral gives the logarithm of the Barnes [43] Gamma\n\n\u2212 i\u03bc|1, R).\nfunction: F (\u03bc, 0) = log \u03932 ( 1+R\n2\n\n6\n\n\fThe real part of this integral is the well-known integral representation for the partition\nfunction of the compactified c = 1 string theory [3]. Its genus expansion (which is also the\nexpansion in 1/\u03bc) reads\nFpert (\u03bc){tk =0} =\n\n\u2212R\n\u03bc2\n2\n\nlog\n\n\u03bc\n\u039b\n\n\u2212\n\n1\nR+ R\n24\n\nlog\n\n\u03bc\n\u039b\n\n+R\n\n\u221e\nX\n\n\u03bc2\u22122h ch (R),\n\n(2.18)\n\nh=2\n\nwhere the genus h term ch (R) is a known polynomial in 1/R.\nIn the Fermi system, the tachyons are represented by collective excitations of the\nFermi liquide [44,2]. A general time-dependent background, corresponding to the tachyon\ndeformation (1.5) of the world-sheet CFT, can be introduced by changing the state of the\nfermi system in the infinite past and in the infinite future, in the spirit of the Polchinski's\nderivation of the tree-level tachyon S-matrix. This amounts to modifying the asymptotics\nat infinity of the fermion eigenfunctions (2.8) in x+ and x\u2212 representations. The spectrum\nof the tachyons should be of the form (1.4) in order to have periodicity in \u03b2 = 2\u03c0R in the\nimaginary time direction. As we know, such deformations of MQM are described by Toda\nhierarchy [45,33,35]. The commuting Toda flows can be formulated either as an hierarchy\nof PDE with respect to the 'times' t\u00b1k , or in terms of a pair of Lax operators satisfying a\nstring equation [46]. Below we remind the necessary facts about the two approaches.\n2.3. Time-dependent backgrounds via Toda hierarchy\nThe partition function of the perturbed theory is a \u03c4 -function of Toda hierarchy and\nsatisfies a hierarchy of PDE with respect to the couplings t\u00b1k . The first of them is the\nToda equation, which is sufficient to describe sine-Liouville perturbation t1 = t\u22121 = \u03bb.\nWritten for the free energy F = log Z, this equation has the form\n\u0010 \u0011\ni\nh\n2 \u2202\u03bc\n1 \u22121\n(2.19)\n\u2202\u03bb \u03bb\u2202\u03bb F (\u03bc, \u03bb) + exp \u22124 sin 2R F (\u03bc, \u03bb) = 1\n4 \u03bb\nand should be solved with initial condition provided by (2.18).\nEquation (2.19) defines the flow between the critical points \u03bb = 0 and \u03bc = 0 of\nthe world-sheet CFT. When \u03bb is large, so that sine-Liouville term sets the scale, the\ncosmological term can be considered as a perturbation. In this case it is convenient to\nintroduce the following variables6\ny = \u03bc\u03be,\n\n\u03be = \u03bb2\n\n\u0001 R\n1\u2212R \u2212 2R\u22121\n3\nR\n\n.\n\n(2.20)\n\nThe variable y is a dimensionless parameter and \u03be \u223c gstr . Therefore, the genus expansion\nof the free energy is an expansion in \u03be with y-dependent coefficients. For each coefficient\n6\n\nThis definition is adjusted to the case R < 1; the case R > 1 can be treated similarly.\n\n7\n\n\fin the expansion the PDF (2.19) yields an ordinary differential equation [33]. Below we\nwill only need the genus zero contribution F0 to the free energy.

Time-dependent backgrounds via fermion wave functions\nAs we mentioned, in the fermionic picture one can introduce sources for incoming and\noutgoing tachyons by changing the asymptotics of the one-particle wave functions. The\nperturbed one-fermion wave functions are obtained from the bare wave functions (2.8) by\nmultiplying with a coordinate-dependent phase factor\nE\n\u03a8E\n(x\u00b1 ) = e\u2213i\u03c6\u00b1 (x\u00b1 ;E) \u03c8\u00b1\n(x\u00b1 ).\n\u00b1\n\n(2.24)\n\nThe phases can be written as a sum of three terms\n\u03c6\u00b1 (x\u00b1 ; E) = V\u00b1 (x\u00b1 ) + 21 \u03c6(E) + v\u00b1 (x\u00b1 ; E),\n\n(2.25)\n\nwhere V\u00b1 vanishes for x\u00b1 = 0, v\u00b1 vanishes for large x\u00b1 \u2192 \u221e, and \u03c6(E) is a constant. The\ndeformations (1.5) of the world sheet CFT correspond, up to a possible analytic redefinition\nof the couplings, to the choice\nX\nt\u00b1k xk/R\n.\n(2.26)\nV\u00b1 (x+ ) =\n\u00b1\nk\u22651\n\nThe constant mode \u03c6(E) and the pieces v\u00b1 (x\u00b1 ; E) depend implicitly on t\u00b1n . They are\ndetermined from the requirement that the left and right fermions are related by the Fourier\ntransformation (2.7):\n\u015c\u03a8E\n= \u03a8E\n, \u015c \u22121 \u03a8E\n= \u03a8E\n(2.27)\n+\n\u2212\n\u2212\n+\nwhere we absorbed the reflection phase factors ei\u03c6(E) in the definition of the deformed\nwave functions.\nFor large negative energy E, the compatibility of the saddle-point equations for the\ntwo integrals in (2.27) gives\nX\nX\n1\n1\nx+ x\u2212 = R\nktk xk/R\n\u2212\nE\n+\nvk (E) x\u2212k/R\nR\n+\n+\nk\u22651\n\n=\n\n1\nR\n\nX\n\nk\u22651\n\nk\u22651\n\nk/R\n\nkt\u2212k x\u2212\n\n\u2212E +\n8\n\n1\nR\n\nX\n\nk\u22651\n\nv\u2212k (E) x\u2212k/R\n.\n\u2212\n\n(2.28)\n\n\fThis means that the two equations (2.28) define two functions x\u00b1 = X\u00b1 (x\u2213 ) which are\ninverse to each other:\nX+ (X\u2212 (x+ )) = x+ .\n\n(2.29)\n\nThe functions X\u00b1 (x\u2213 ), taken at the Fermi level EF = \u2212\u03bc, can be considered as the\n\ngluing functions for an analytic curve M in C2 . This curve yields all the information\nfor the given background. Its real section determines the shape of the Fermi sea in the\nquasiclassical limit \u03bc \u2192 \u221e. The functions X\u00b1 (x\u2213 ) are in general multi-valued, but there\n\nis always a global parameter, the \"proper time\" variable \u03c4 , such that the solution of (2.28)\nis given by x\u00b1 = x\u00b1 (\u03c4 ). If all couplings t\u00b1k with k > kmax vanish, then the solution is of\nthe form [46]\n\n1\n\u00b1\u03c4 \u2212 2R\n\u03c7\n\nx\u00b1 (\u03c4 ) = e\n\n1+\n\nkX\nmax\nk=1\n\nk\n\u2213R\n\u03c4\n\na\u00b1k e\n\n!\n\n,\n\n(2.30)\n\nwhere the quantity \u03c7 is related to the constant mode of the phase (2.25) via\n\u03c7 = \u2212R \u2202\u2202E \u03c6.\n\n(2.31)\n\nThe coefficients a\u00b1k and \u03c7 can be found by substituting (2.30) into (2.28) and comparing\nk\n\ncoefficients in front of e\u00b1 R \u03c4 . For example, in the case of sine-Liouville deformation, i.e.\n\nwhen only the first coupling constants are nonzero, this procedure gives\n1\n\n\u03bce R \u03c7 \u2212\n\n1\nR2\n\n1\u2212\n\n1\nR\n\n\u0001\n\n\u03bb2 e\n\n2R\u22121\n\u03c7\nR2\n\n= 1,\n\na\u00b11 =\n\n\u03bb\nR\n\ne\n\nR\u22121/2\n\u03c7\nR2\n\n.\n\n(2.32)\n\nTaking into account that \u2202\u03bc2 F0 = \u03c7, it is easy to show that this equation is equivalent\nto the solution (2.23) of Toda equation. The solution beyond the tree level can be found\nusing the full Toda integrable structure.\nThe parametrization (2.30) can be thought of as a canonical transformation relating\nthe phase space coordinates (x\u2212 , x+ ) and (\u03c4, E), where the proper time \u03c4 appears as the\nvariable canonically conjugated to the energy E:\n{x\u2212 , x+ } = 1 \u21d4 {\u03c4, E} = 1.\n\n(2.33)\n\nThe origin of the last relation can be traced to the Lax representation of the operators\nx\u00b1 in the basis of the deformed wave functions, where the parameter \u03c9 = e\u03c4 arises as the\n\nclassical limit of the shift operator \u03c9\u0302 = e\u2212i\u2202E [35,46].\n9\n\n\f3. NPC in sine-Liouville string theory from Toda equation\nIn this section we restrict ourselves to the sine-Liouville deformation with coupling \u03bb, in\nwhich case the free energy can be determined from Toda equation (2.19). The initial\ncondition is provided by the free energy of the non-deformed theory which is given by\nthe integral (2.17). Before studying the theory with the sine-Liouville deformation, let us\nremind the exact expression for the NPC in the non-deformed c = 1 string theory following\nfrom the integral representation (2.17). The integral has a small imaginary part, which\ndescribes the flow of eigenvalues beyond the top of the inverse oscillator potential. It can\nbe evaluated by extending the contour to the whole real axis and taking the residues at\nthe two series of poles, sn = 2i\u03c0n and sn = 2i\u03c0Rn:\nFnp (\u03bc){tk =0} = i\n\nX\nn\n\nX\ne\u22122\u03c0n\u03bc\ne\u22122\u03c0Rn\u03bc\n+\ni\n.\n4n(\u22121)n sin \u03c0n\n4n(\u22121)n sin(\u03c0Rn)\nR\nn\n\n(3.1)\n\nThis expression is of course compatible with (2.12) and (2.15). We see that there are two\ntypes of NPC, which have their origin in the two kinds of branes in the c = 1 string theory\n[10]. The first type is due to the D-instanton with Dirichlet boundary conditions on both\nmatter and Liouville fields, whereas the second one is due to a D0-brane with Neumann\nboundary condition for the matter field. In both cases the pre-exponential factors do not\n0\ndepend on \u03bc and therefore scale like gstr\n.\nThe two types of NPC behave very differently with sine-Liouville coupling \u03bb. The\nNPC of the type e\u22122\u03c0Rn\u03bc do not flow with \u03bb and are always given by the second term of\n(3.1). Indeed, given a solution of Toda equation (2.19), by adding a linear combination of\nexponents e\u22122\u03c0R\u03bck with \u03bb-independent coefficients one obtaines another solution.\nIn contrast, the NPC given at \u03bb = 0 by the first term of (3.1), evolve non-trivially\nwith \u03bb. The leading exponential contributions of this series were analyzed in [10,11] for\ndeformation by vortices. From these works we know7 that the leading non-perturbative\neffects have the form\n\u03b5n (\u03bc, \u03bb) \u223c e\u22122gn (y)/\u03be ,\n(3.2)\nwhere\ngn (y) = y\u03b8n (y) +\n\n\u221a1\n\u03b1\n\nX(y)\n\ne\u2212 2R2 sin \u03b8nR(y) ,\n\n\u03b1=\n\n1\u2212R\nR(2R\u22121)2\n\n(3.3)\n\nand \u03b8n (y) = \u2202y gn is found as a solution of the algebraic equation\nsin \u03b8n =\n7\n\n1\nR\n\n\u22121\n\n\u0001\u2212 21\n\ne\n\n2R\u22121\nX(y)\n2R2\n\nsin\n\n1\u2212R\nR\n\n\u0001\n\u03b8n .\n\n(3.4)\n\nThe expressions obtained in [10,11] should be used after the T-duality transformation \u03be \u2192\n\n\u03be/R, y \u2192 y.\n\n10\n\n\fThe different solutions of (3.4) are labeled by the integer n in such way that \u03b8n \u2192 \u03c0n\nwhen \u03bb \u2192 0.\nNow we would like to find the subleading order, i.e. the factor in front of the exponential in (3.2). Following the procedure suggested in [10], we take two solutions F and F\u0303\nof (2.19) that differ by the exponentially small quantity \u03b5 = F\u0303 \u2212 F . Then \u03b5 must satisfy\nthe linearized equation\n\u0010 \u0011\n2\nF0 (\u03bc,\u03bb)\n\u2212 12 \u2202\u03bc\n2 \u2202\u03bc\n1 \u22121\nR\n(3.5)\nsin 2R \u03b5(\u03bc, \u03bb) = 0,\n\u2202\u03bb \u03bb\u2202\u03bb \u03b5(\u03bc, \u03bb) \u2212 4 e\n4\u03bb\nwhere in the exponent in the second term we approximated\n\u0010 \u0011\n\u2202\u03bc\n4R2 sin2 2R\nF (\u03bc, \u03bb) \u2243 \u2202\u03bc2 F0 = R log \u03be + X(y).\n\n(3.6)\n\nThis approximation is correct for our purpose since the subleading non-perturbative contribution is of order O(gstr) with respect to the leading one, whereas the perturbative genus\n2\nexpansion goes in powers of gstr\n. Finally, changing the variables from (\u03bb, \u03bc) to (\u03be, y) we\nwrite equation (3.5) as\n\u0010\n\u0011\nX(y)\n\u2212 2\n\u03be\n2\n2\n2\nR\nsin 2R \u2202y \u03b5(\u03be, y).\n(3.7)\n\u03b1\u03be (y\u2202y + \u03be\u2202\u03be ) \u03b5(\u03be, y) = 4 e\nThis equation is solved by a refinement of the Ansatz (3.2):\n\nb\n\n\u03b5(\u03bc, y) \u2243 A(\u03be, y) e\u22122g(y)/\u03be ,\n\nA(\u03be, y) = [\u03bea(y)] ,\n\n(3.8)\n\nwhere b may depend on y. We omit the index n since it does not appear explicitly in the\nequations. The details of the solution are presented in Appendix B. The result is that\nb = const and a(y) is given by (B.9).\nThe constant b, which gives the power of gstr in the pre-exponential factor, is not fixed\nby Toda equation. It looks like an integration constant. Therefore, the first idea is that it\ncan be fixed from the initial condition (3.1) at \u03bb = 0, which implies that it should vanish.\nOn the other hand, let us consider the limit of small \u03bb.

Thus, we see that sine-Liouville deformation changes drastically the behavior of the non-perturbative corrections in the subleading\norder: the power of gstr \u223c \u03be changes discontinuously from 0 to 1/2. This means that the\nlimits \u039b \u2192 \u221e and \u03bb \u2192 0 do not commute. As we will see later, the change of the behavior of the non-perturbative corrections can be explained with the fact that the tachyon\nperturbations break the time translation symmetry of the theory.\nA nice consistency check of the result (3.12) is to reproduce the non-perturbative\ncorrections to the free energy of the pure gravity in the limit where the couplings approach\nthe c = 0 critical point. We discuss this limit in Appendix C where we show that the result\n(3.12) does reproduce the correct critical behavior.\n\n4. NPC from the quasiclassical wave functions\nThe approach based on Toda equation is conceptually straightforward but does not allow\nto fix the solution completely. Alternatively one can exploit the fermionic formulation\nto evaluate the non-perturbative corrections to the fermion reflection phase and then use\nthe relation (2.15) to find those for the partition function. Moreover, this second approach\nallows to generalize the results obtained in the previous section to the case of a deformation\nwith arbitrary number of non-vanishing couplings. Before considering the general case, we\nwill illustrate the method for the stationary background, where the exact form of the\nnon-perturbative corrections is known.\n4.1. The case of a stationary background\nAlthough the exact expression for the reflection phase is known, we follow here another\napproach which works only quasiclassically but can be generalized to other situations. For\nthis we use the following matrix element of the scattering operator (2.10)\nZZ \u221e\nix x\n1\nE (x ) e + \u2212 \u03c8 E \u2032 (x ) = ei\u03c60 (E) \u03b4(E \u2212 E \u2032 ),\n\u221a\ndx+ dx\u2212 \u03c8\u2212\n(4.1)\n+\n\u2212\n+\n2\u03c0\n0\n\nwhere we used the orthonormality of the wave functions (2.8). Substituting the explicit\nexpression for the wave functions (2.8) and introducing a cut-off \u039b equal to the volume of\nthe phase space, we write the diagonal matrix element as\n1\n(2\u03c0)3/2\n\nZZ\n\n\u221a\n0\n\n\u039b\n\ndx+ dx\u2212\n\u221ax x\n+ \u2212\n\nei(x+ x\u2212 +E log(x+ x\u2212 )) = ei\u03c60 (E) \u03c10 (E),\n12\n\n(4.2)\n\n\f1\nlog(\u2212\u039b/E) is the density of states corresponding to the cut-off \u039b. In\nwhere \u03c10 (E) \u2248 2\u03c0\n1\nthe following discussion we can safely approximate \u03c10 (E) by 2\u03c0\nlog \u039b.\nWe would like to evaluate the integral (4.2) by the saddle point method. The two\nsaddle point equations associated with the variables x+ and x\u2212 actually coincide and both\ngive the equation for the classical fermion phase-space trajectory with energy E:\n\nx+ x\u2212 = \u2212E.\n\n(4.3)\n\nThe fact that the two equations coincide means that we do not have isolated saddle points\nbut 'saddle contours' that go along the flat direction. If we change the variables to\nx\u00b1 (\u03c4 ) =\n\n\u221a\n\n\u01eb e\u00b1\u03c4 ,\n\n(4.4)\n\nthen the flat direction is along the 'proper time' \u03c4 .

This gives the genus-zero perturbative contribution for the reflection phase:\n\u03c60 (E) \u2248 E log(\u2212E) \u2212 E.\n\n(4.7)\n\nThe appearance of the non-perturbative corrections is related to the fact that the\nphase of the integrand in (4.2) is a multivalued function of \u01eb. As a consequence, there is\nan infinite number of saddles at\nlog \u01ebn = log(\u2212E) \u2212 2\u03c0in\n\n(4.8)\n\nwith n integer. The saddles with n > 0 can be connected by constant phase contours to the\ndominant saddle and thus are potentially relevant. The integral along a contour that passes\nthrough the n-th subdominant saddle contributes a factor (\u22121)n e2\u03c0nE ei(E log(\u2212E)\u2212E) ,\nwhere (\u22121)n comes from the pre-factor in (4.6).

The choice of the\nintegration contours and the evaluation of the contributions of the subdominant saddles is\na delicate problem and we will not discuss it here.\nInstead, we will try to understand the geometrical meaning of the saddles (4.8) in\nterms of the complex curve defined by the saddle point equation (4.3) at the Fermi level\nEF = \u2212\u03bc,\n\nx+ x\u2212 = \u03bc.\n\n(4.11)\n\nAs a real manifold the curve represents a hyperboloid, depicted in fig. 1a.

The \"saddle contours\" are given by the B-cycle and n copies of the Acycle. The second picture represents the covering of the hyperboloid by the complex\n\u03c4 -plane and non-minimal saddle contours for x\u00b1 (\u03c4 ) in the universal cover.\n14\n\nIm \u03c4\n3\u03c0\n\n\fHowever, because of the multi-valuedness of the integrand in (4.2), the solutions of the\nsaddle point equation are actually described by the universal cover M0 of the curve (4.11),\nglobally parameterized by the whole complex \u03c4 -plane. For the minimal saddle, n = 0, the\nintegration contours for dx+ and dx+ belong to the same sheet of the universal cover M0\nand coincide with the cycle B on the hyperboloid, which is parameterized by the real axis\nin the \u03c4 -plane.\nIn contrast, the non-minimal saddles, n \u2265 1, are described by two different contours\non the universal cover M0 : one of the contours describes x+ (\u03c4 ) and the other one gives\nx\u2212 (\u03c4 ). In the parametrization (4.12), they are represented as contours joining \u2212\u221e \u2212 2\u03c0in\nto \u221e and \u2212\u221e to \u221e + 2\u03c0in, respectively, as the ones drown in fig. 1b. These conditions\nensure that Im (log x\u00b1 ) = 0 in the asymptotic regions of large x\u00b1 . The two contours\nhave the same projection in M0 where they follow the cycle B and at some point wind\nn times around the cycle A, as it is shown on fig 1a. But since x+ and x\u2212 follow the\ndifferent contours in the universal cover, the integrand in (4.2) along such a contour yields\nan additional factor (\u22121)n e\u22122\u03c0n\u03bc .\nIn this way, the non-minimal saddles are assiciated with 'double contours' on the\nhyperboloid (4.11), rather than with double points. The double points appear in the\ncomplex curve for the resolvent, y = w(x), which is also the c \u2192 1 limit of the FZZT\ncurves of minimal string theories. The curve for the resolvent is parametrized as\nx=\n\np\n\n2\u03bc cosh \u03c4,\n\nw=\u2212\n\n\u221a\n\n2\u03bc\n\u03c4 sinh \u03c4\n\u03c0\n\n(4.13)\n\nand represents a Z2 orbifold of the universal cover of the hyperboloid (4.11), obtained by\n\u221a\nidentifying the points \u03c4 and \u2212\u03c4 . There are two points on the curve (\u00b1 2\u03bc, 0), which are\nalso the positions of the branch points of y = w(x), which are images of infinitely many\npoints on the \u03c4 -plane \u03c4 = i\u03c0n. They appear as the (degenerate) limit of the double points\nof the minimal string curves.\n4.2. Quasiclassical wave functions in the general case\nNow we will apply the same method to calculate the NPC to the scattering phase in\nthe case of a general tachyon deformation described in section 2.4. The first step of the\ncalculation consists in the evaluation of the quasiclassical asymptotics of the fermion wave\nfunctions.\nFirst of all, we need the classical limit of the phases \u03c6\u00b1 (x\u00b1 , E) in (2.24), which is\ndetermined by the compatibility of two equations (2.28). The integration of these equations\ngives the following representation\n\u03c6\u00b1 (x\u00b1 ) =\n\nZ\n\nx\u00b1\n\n\u221e\n\nX\u2213 (x\u2032\u00b1 ) dx\u2032\u00b1 + E log x\u00b1 + \u03c6\u00b1 ,\n15\n\n(4.14)\n\n\fwhere the functions x\u00b1 = X\u00b1 (x\u2213 ) are the classical fermion trajectories defined in parametric form by (2.30) and \u03c6\u00b1 are integration constants. As a result, in this approximation\nthe wave functions take the form\nRx\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2213i\u03c6\u00b1 \u2213i \u221e\u00b1 X\u2213 (x\u00b1 ) dx\u00b1\nE\n,\n(4.15)\n\u03a8\u00b1 (x\u00b1 ) \u2248 B\u00b1 (x\u00b1 ) e\ne\nwhere B\u00b1 are factors coming from the subleading order in the Planck constant. These\nfactors and the zero mode \u03c6 = \u03c6+ + \u03c6\u2212 can be fixed from the normalization condition\nsimilar to (4.1).8\nWith the cut-off \u039b introduced as in the previous subsection, the wave functions satisfy\nthe normalization condition\nZ\n\n\u221a\n\u039b\n\n(x\u00b1 ) \u03a8E\n(x\u00b1 ) =\ndx\u00b1 \u03a8E\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\n0\n\n1\n2\u03c0\n\nlog \u039b.\n\n(4.16)\n\nA second condition follows from the action of the scattering operator, that is the Fourier\ntransformation. Since we absorbed the scattering phase into the wave functions, the Fourier\ntransformation acts as the identity operator, which leads, together with (4.16), to\nZ\n\n\u221a1\n2\u03c0\n\n\u221a\n\n\u039b\n\n\u221a\n\nZ\n\ndx+\n\n0\n\n\u039b\n\ndx\u2212 \u03a8E\n(x\u2212 ) eix+ x\u2212 \u03a8E\n(x+ ) = \u03c1(E).\n\u2212\n+\n\n0\n\n(4.17)\n\nSubstituting the asymptotic form (4.15) and keeping only the constant cut-off dependent\npiece of the density (2.14), one writes the two conditions as\n\u221a\n\nZ\n\n0\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n\u221a\n\u039b\n\ndx+\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n\u039b\n\ndx\u00b1 |B\u00b1 |2 =\n\n1\nlog \u039b,\n2\u03c0\n\n\u221a\n\n\u039b\n\niS(x+ ,x\u2212 )\n\ndx\u2212 B\u0304\u2212 B+ e\n\n(4.18)\n\nei\u03c6\n\u221a\n=\nlog \u039b,\n2\u03c0\n\nwhere we introduced the effective action\nZ x\nZ\n+\n\u2032\n\u2032\nS(x+ , x\u2212 ) = x+ x\u2212 \u2212\nX\u2212 (x+ ) dx+ \u2212\n\u221e\n\nx\u2212\n\n\u221e\n\nX+ (x\u2032\u2212 ) dx\u2032\u2212 .\n\n(4.19)\n\n(4.20)\n\nThe integral in the second condition can be evaluated by the saddle point method.\nThe property (2.29), following from the compatibility of two equations (2.28), means that\nthe leading contribution to the integral is again associated with a one-dimensional saddle\ncontour \u03b3F in the (x+ , x\u2212 ) plane, defined by the functions x\u00b1 = X\u00b1 (x\u2213 ) and going from\nx\u2212 = \u221e to x+ = \u221e. For E = \u2212\u03bc the saddle contour defines the profile of the Fermi sea.\n8\n\nNote that the deformed wave functions are not orthogonal anymore.\n\n16\n\n\fTo evaluate the gaussian fluctuations in the transversal direction to the saddle contour,\nit is convenient to change variables from (x+ , x\u2212 ) to (\u03c4, \u2212\u01eb), where \u03c4 is the same as in\n(2.30) and the variable \u01eb parameterizes the transversal direction. The equation of the\nsaddle contour in the new variables is \u01eb = \u2212E.

Knowing the wave functions (4.15), one can also reconstruct the\nquasiclassical wave function in the x-representation. We refer to Appendix D for details.\n4.3. Instantons as double points of the complex curve\nIn order to find the non-perturbative corrections for the free energy it is sufficient to\ncalculate those for the scattering phase \u03c6(E). This can be done by taking into account\nalso the non-minimal saddles of the integral (4.19). We saw in section 4.1 that if there is no\ntachyon potential, the non-minimal saddles are given by pairs of one-dimensional contours\nliving on different sheets of the universal cover of the hyperboloid x+ x\u2212 = \u03bc, but having\nthe same image in C2 . The collective coordinate along these saddles is the Minkowski\ntime, since the background is time-independent. In presence of tachyon potential there is\nno time translational invariance. As a consequence, the minimal saddle contour will evolve\nwith time and the non-minimal saddles will be given by isolated saddle points, or double\npoints of the deformed complex curve, to be described below. The meaning of these double\npoints is essentially the same as in the minimal string theories [12,14].\nAgain, the saddle-point equations x+ = X+ (x\u2212 ) and x\u2212 = X\u2212 (x+ ) define a complex\ncurve M in C2 , which is a deformation of the universal cover of the hyperboloid x+ x\u2212 = \u03bc.\nThe Riemann surfaces of the functions X+ and X\u2212 are the projections of the curve M to\nthe x\u2212 and x+ complex planes. Due to the multi-valuedness of the functions X+ (x\u2212 ) and\n17\n\n\fX\u2212 (x+ ), equation (2.29) has also particular solutions describing isolated double points,\nwhere the complex curve touches itself [13].\nThe double points can be classified most easily by using the uniformization parameter\n\u03c4 , defined in equation (2.30). They represent pairs of points \u03c4 \u2032 6= \u03c4 \u2032\u2032 in the complex \u03c4 -plane\nsuch that\nx+ (\u03c4 \u2032 ) = x+ (\u03c4 \u2032\u2032 ) and x\u2212 (\u03c4 \u2032 ) = x\u2212 (\u03c4 \u2032\u2032 ).\n(4.24)\nEach double point is by construction a solution of (2.29) and as such represents a saddle\npoint for the action (4.20).\nLet us restrict ourselves to the case tk = t\u2212k for all k, which is simpler to analyze. Then\nak = a\u2212k in (2.30) and the set of double points is given by the pairs (\u03c4 \u2032 = \u2212i\u03b8n , \u03c4 \u2032\u2032 = i\u03b8n ),\nwhere \u03b8n are determined by\nsin (\u03b8n ) =\n\nkX\nmax\n\nak sin\n\nk=1\n\nk\u2212R\nR\n\n\u0001\n\u03b8n ,\n\n\u03b8n \u2192 \u03c0n when all tk \u2192 0,\n\n(4.25)\n\nAs \u03c4 \u2032 and \u03c4 \u2032\u2032 are pure imaginary and complex conjugated, x+ (\u00b1i\u03b8n ) = x\u2212 (\u00b1i\u03b8n ) are both\nreal. For the sine-Liouville deformation the discrete set of parameters \u03b8n is determined by\nthe equation\n\u0001\nsin (\u03b8n ) = a(y) sin 1\u2212R\n\u03b8\n(4.26)\nn\nR\n\nwith a(y) from (2.32). This equation is the same as (3.4) and therefore the parameters \u03b8n\ncoincide with those defined in section 3.\nLet us calculate the contribution of the n-th saddle point to the normalization integral\n(4.19). The leading contribution is given by the value of the action (4.20), which depends\non the integration contours for dx+ and dx\u2212 along the complex curve. The two contours\ncan be parameterized in the \u03c4 -plane by the intervals\n\u03c4 \u2208 (\u221e, 0) \u222a (0, \u2212i\u03b8n )\n\n\u03c4 \u2208 (\u2212\u221e, 0) \u222a (0, i\u03b8n )\n\nfor x+ (\u03c4 ),\nfor x\u2212 (\u03c4 ).\n\nAs a result, the action is given by Spert + iSn ,\nI\nZ\nx\u2212 dx+ ,\nSn = i\nx\u2212 dx+ ,\nSpert =\n\u03b3F\n\n(4.27)\n\n(4.28)\n\n\u03b3n\n\nwhere the contours \u03b3F and \u03b3n are respectively the images of the intervals (\u2212\u221e, \u221e) and\n(i\u03b8n , \u2212i\u03b8n ) in the \u03c4 -plane.\nThe first term Spert gives, according to eq. (4.23), the leading perturbative approximation to the scattering phase. Its integration contour is the B-cycle connecting the two\npunctures at x\u00b1 = \u221e. On the other hand, the image of the integration contour \u03b3n for the\nsecond term Sn is a closed loop in C2 , because it ends at the n-th double point. If the\n18\n\n\fdouble point is considered as a vanishing A-cycle of the complex curve, then the contour\n\u03b3n is a the dual compact B-cycle.\nTo find the subleading pre-exponential factors, one should evaluate the fluctuations\naround the saddle points. The variation of the action (4.20) gives\n\u03b4 2 Sn (x+ , x\u2212 ) = \u03b4x+ \u03b4x\u2212 \u2212\n\n1 dx\u2212\n2 dx+\n\n\u2212i\u03b8n\n\n\u00012\n\n\u03b4x+\n\n\u2212\n\n1 dx+\n2 dx\u2212\n\ni\u03b8n\n\n\u03b4x\u2212\n\n\u00012\n\n.\n\n(4.29)\n\nThis leads to the following prefactor in the calculation of the integral (4.19)\n\u2206n =\n\n\u0010 \u2202x \u0011\n\u2202\u03c4\n\n\u0010 \u2202x \u0011\n\u2212\n\n+\n\n\u2212i\u03b8n\n\n\u2202\u03c4\n\ni\u03b8n\n\n\u0012\n\u0010 dx \u0011\n1 \u2212 dx\u2212\n+\n\n\u0010 dx \u0011\n+\n\n\u2212i\u03b8n\n\ndx\u2212\n\ni\u03b8n\n\n\u0013\n\n\u22121/2\n\n,\n\n(4.30)\n\nwhere the first two factors come from the quasiclassical wave functions.\nAdding together contributions to the left hand side of (4.19) of the minimal saddle\ncontour, given in (4.22), and all isolated saddle points, we get9\n\"\n#\n\u221e r\nX\n\u03c0\neiSpert log \u039b +\n(4.31)\n\u2206n e\u2212Sn = ei\u03c6(E) log \u039b.\n2\nn=1\nTaking the logarithm of both sides, one gets a quasiclassical expression for the zero mode\nthat includes the non-perturbative corrections\nZ\nX \u221a\u03c0 \u2206 n\n\u221a\n\u03c6(E) \u2248\nx\u2212 dx+ \u2212 i\ne\u2212Sn .\n(4.32)\n2\nlog\n\u039b\n\u03b3F\nn>0\nFinally, we can apply (2.15) to evaluate the non-perturbative terms for the free energy\nitself which gives\n\u221a\nX \u2206n\ni \u03c0\ne\u2212Sn .\n(4.33)\nF \u2248 Fpert + \u221a\n\u2202 \u03bc Sn\n2 2 log \u039b n>0 sin 2R\nThe classical action Sn associated with the n-th double point can be written as\nSn = i\n\n\u2212i\u03b8\nZ n\n\nx\u2212 \u2202\u03c4 x+ d\u03c4 = \u22122\n\ni\u03b8n\n\nZE\n\n\u03b8n d\u01eb,\n\n(4.34)\n\nwhere we used the canonical transformation (2.33), and the prefactor to the exponent has\nthe form\n\u0012\n\u0014\u0010\n\u0015\u0013\u22121/2\n\u0011\n\u0010 \u2202x \u0011\n\u0010 \u2202x \u0011 \u0010 \u2202x \u0011\n\u2206n\n\u2202x+\n2 \u03b8\n\u2212\n+\n\u2212\n= sin R\nAn \u223c\n\u2212 \u2202\u03c4\n.

The analysis\nof section 3 based on Toda equation shows that these corrections do not depend on the\ntachyon potential and therefore are given by the last term on the r.h.s. of (3.1). However\nthere is an argument, advanced in [10], that such terms do not appear whenever a tachyon\npotential is switched on.\nThe result (4.35) gives the instanton corrections for an arbitrary tachyon deformation\nof the theory. Now let us restrict ourselves to the case of sine-Liouville deformation.\nIt was already shown in [13] that in this case Sn reproduce the leading non-perturbative\ncorrections (3.2) obtained by Toda equation. Therefore let us concentrate on the subleading\ncontribution (4.35). Calculating the derivatives using (2.30), where only terms with k = 1\nare present, and taking into account the defining equation (4.26) for \u03b8 = \u03b8n , one finds\n\u001a\n\u001b\n1\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001 \u22121/2\n\u2212R\u03c7\n2\n2 \u03b8\n1\n1\u2212R\nA(\u03be, y) = C e\nsin \u03b8 sin R R \u2212 1 cot R \u03b8 \u2212 cot \u03b8\n,\n(4.36)\n\nwhere the overall coefficient C is found to be\u221a\ni \u03c0R\n.\n(4.37)\nC= \u221a\n4 2 log \u039b\nThis result is in complete agreement with the result (3.12) obtained by integrating Toda\nequation.\nIn particular, this confirms our claim that for any finite tachyon deformation the\n1/2\nsubleading corrections scale like gstr and thus they are non-analytic in the limit \u03bb \u2192 0.\nThis is due to the breakdown of the time translation invariance in any time-dependent\nbackground. As a consequence, in the first case the contributions to the saddle point\napproximation come from one-dimensional saddle contours, whereas in the second case\nthey arise from isolated saddle points. Hence, the determinants of fluctuations, giving the\nmain non-trivial contribution to the subleading correction, are one- and two-dimensional,\ncorrespondingly. This explains the difference in the power of the string coupling.\n5. The instanton effects from bosonization\n\nIn the matrix model, the tachyon modes are collective excitations of fermions propagating\nas left and right moving waves on the Fermi surface. After second quantization, these\nmodes form a bosonic field. In (x, p) representation of MQM, the fermions are nonrelativistic and as a consequence the bosonic field is self-interacting. In contrast, as in\n(x+ , x\u2212 ) representation the one-particle fermionic Hamiltonian becomes first order, the\nfermions can be exactly bosonized. This bosonization is essentially the one that occurs in\nToda hierarchy, modulo some subtleties related to the fact that we are using a non-compact\nrealization of the latter.\nIn this section we show that the non-perturbative corrections to the free energy can\nbe expressed in terms of vertex operators for a boson field. The bosonic field in question\ndescribes not the whole spectrum of tachyons in the theory, but only the discrete subset\nthat survives after the compactification. The bosonic field formalism works particularly\nwell in the quasiclassical limit and gives a nice interpretation to the results obtained in the\nprevious two sections. It might also help to interpret these results in terms of D-branes in\nc = 1 string theory with time-dependent background.\n20\n\n\f5.1. Second quantized fermions and density operator\nWe start by introducing the second quantized fermion fields\nZ\n\u0001\n\u2213t\n\u03a8\u0302\u00b1 (x\u00b1 , t) = dE e\u2213Et/2 \u03a8E\ne\nx\nb(E),\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\nZ\n\u0001 \u2020\n\u2213t x\n\u03a8\u0302\u2020\u00b1 (x\u00b1 , t) = dE e\u2213Et/2 \u03a8E\ne\nb (E),\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\n(5.1)\n\nwhere the operator amplitudes b(E) and b\u2020 (E) satisfy the canonical anti-commutation\nrelations\n{b\u2020 (E), b(E \u2032)} = \u03b4(E \u2212 E \u2032 ),\n(5.2)\nwith all other anticommutators equal to zero. We work with only one set of operator\namplitudes, since the left and right fermion operators are related by Fourier transformation\nand the fermion wave functions have the property (2.27). The last property followed from\nthe fact that we absorbed the reflection phase in the definition of the wave functions, so\nthat the fermion reflection operator acts as the identity operator on the amplitudes in\nE-representation.\nWe are interested in operators in the matrix model of the form\nOf = Tr f (X+ , X\u2212 ),\n\n(5.3)\n\nwhere f (x+ , x\u2212 ) is a smooth function of its two variables. The operator Of is well defined\nas the matrices X+ and X\u2212 commute due to the gauge field. In the second quantized\nformalism, this operator translates into\nZ\n\u00d4f = dx+ dx\u2212 f (x+ , x\u2212 ) \u00db(x+ , x\u2212 ),\n(5.4)\nwhere\n\u00db(x+ , x\u2212 , t) =\n\n\u221a1\n2\u03c0\n\neix+ x\u2212 \u03a8\u0302\u2020\u2212 (x\u2212 , t)\u03a8\u0302+ (x+ , t)\n\n(5.5)\n\nis the fermion phase space density operator. The expectation value of the operator \u00db, or\nthe Wigner's function, is evaluated with respect to the thermal vacuum of the compactified\ntheory which is defined by [3]\n\u03bc|b\u2020 (E) b(E \u2032)|\u03bc =\n\n\u03b4(E \u2212 E \u2032 )\n.\n1 + e\u03b2(\u03bc+E)\n\n(5.6)\n\nIn particular, for the trace of the identity operator N \u2261 h\u03bc| Tr 1|\u03bci we find, using (5.6) and\n(4.17),\nZ\nZ \u221e\ndE \u03c1(E)\n.\nN = dx+ dx\u2212 h\u03bc|\u00db(x+ , x\u2212 )|\u03bci =\n(5.7)\n\u03b2(\u03bc+E)\n\u2212\u221e 1 + e\n21\n\n\fComparing with (2.13), one reproduces the well known relation between the number of\nfermions and the grand canonical free energy\nN =\u2212\n\n\u03bc\n1\nlog \u039b \u2212\n\u2202\u03bc F ,\n2\u03c0\n2\u03c0R\n\n(5.8)\n\nwhere we explicitly included the non-universal cut-off dependent term.

Bosonization formula for the fermion wave functions and the density operator\nThe fermionic operators can be expressed as exponents of a bosonic field with continuous\nspectrum of energies. It is however technically more advantageous to introduce another\nbosonic field with discrete spectrum associated with the possible energies in the Euclidean\ncompactified theory. If we restrict the spectrum of tachyons to be discrete as in the\ncompactified theory, the spectrum of the bosonic fields will be also restricted to the discrete\nset of purely imaginary momenta pn = in/R, n \u2208 Z. The sector of the theory spanned on\nthese states gives a 'non-compact' realization of Toda integrable structure.10 The bosonic\nfield is thus spanned on the operators {E, \u2202E , t\u00b1n , \u2202t\u00b1n } and has the form\n\u03a6\u0302\u00b1 (x\u00b1 ) = V\u00b1 (x\u00b1 ) + 12 \u03c6\u0302 \u2212 E log x\u00b1 + D\u0302\u00b1 (x\u00b1 ),\n\n(5.10)\n\nwhere V\u00b1 are the potentials (2.26) and the differential operators \u03c6\u0302 and D\u0302\u00b1 are defined by\n\u03c6\u0302 = \u2212 R1 \u2202E ,\n\nD\u0302\u00b1 (x\u00b1 ) =\n\nX\n\nn\u22651\n\n1\nn\n\nx\u2212n/R\n\u2202t\u00b1n .\n\u00b1\n\n(5.11)\n\nThe deformed fermion wave function at level E = \u2212\u03bc, known in the mathematical\nliterature as Baker-Akhieser function, can be written as the expectation value of normal\nordered exponential of a bosonic field.

Quasiclassical limit\nThe quasiclassical asymptotics of the fermionic wave functions is determined, through the\nrepresentation (5.12), by the quasiclassical expansion of the exponentials of the bosonic\nfields \u03a6\u0302\u00b1 (x\u00b1 ). Here we will restrict ourselves to the first two orders:\n1\n\n\u03a8\u2212\u03bc\n(x\u00b1 ) = \u221a2\u03c01 x e\u2213i\u03a6\u00b1 (x\u00b1 ) e\u2212 2 h:\u03a6\u0302\u00b1 (x\u00b1 )\u03a6\u0302\u00b1 (x\u00b1 ):ic ,\n\u00b1\n\n(5.17)\n\n\u03a6\u00b1 (x\u00b1 ) \u2261 h\u03a6\u0302\u00b1 (x\u00b1 )i\n\n(5.18)\n\n\u00b1\n\nwhere\nis the vacuum expectation value of the field \u03a6\u0302\u00b1 (x\u00b1 ) and h* * *ic denotes the connected\ncorrelator. In the leading order the phase of the fermion wave functions are thus given by\nthe expectation values of the left and right bosonic fields:\n\u03c6\u00b1 (x\u00b1 ; \u2212\u03bc) + \u03bc log x\u00b1 \u2248 \u03a6\u00b1 (x\u00b1 ).\n23\n\n(5.19)\n\n\fIn particular, the quasiclassical phase of the fermion scattering is equal to the expectation\nvalue of the zero mode \u03c6\u0302\n\u03c6 = h\u03c6\u0302i.\n(5.20)\nIn order to find the subleading factor in the exponential, we need the two-point correlation functions. The connected two-point correlators are generating functions for the\nderivatives \u2202\u03bc \u2202n F and \u2202n \u2202m F , which were calculated in the case of sine-Liouville deformation in [34] from Toda hierarchy.

This divergence appears due to breakdown of\nthe quasiclassical approximation of the bosonization formulae near the Fermi sea. This\ndivergent factor can be canceled by application of a difference operator in \u03bc. Indeed, in\nthe given approximation such an operator acts only on the exponent.

Discussion\nIn this paper we studied non-perturbative corrections to the partition function of the\ncompactified c = 1 string theory deformed by a generic tachyon source. The flows between\ndifferent backgrounds are described by a non-compact realization of Toda hierarchy. The\nspace of all such backgrounds is parametrized by a set of Toda 'times' {t\u00b1k }, which in\nthe world sheet CFT have the meaning of coupling constants for the allowed marginal\ndeformations. Each such time-dependent background is described by a complex curve,\nwhich gives the solution of Toda hierarchy in the dispersionless, or quasiclassical, limit.\n12\n\nIn the case of the two-matrix model, where the integrable structure is that of KP hierarchy,\n\nsuch an exact formula was derived in [21].\n\n26\n\n\fWe studied the dual realization of the string theory as the singlet sector of the matrix\nquantum mechanics, described by free fermions in upside-down oscillator potential, using\nchiral canonical coordinates x\u00b1 \u223c x\u00b1p. In the fermionic system the complex curve appears\nas the complexified classical trajectory at the Fermi level. This curve has an infinite (for\nR irrational) number of double points, obtained as solutions of a transcendental equation.\nThe leading non-perturbative corrections are associated with these double points, in the\nsame way as in the minimal string theories. The exponents for the leading NPC are given\nby integral of a holomorphic differential along the compact cycles associated with these\ndouble points.\nOur main new result is the expression for the subleading correction given in (4.35) for\na general tachyon potential and in (4.36) for the particular case of sine-Liouville theory. We\nderived these results by quasiclassical analysis of the fermionic wave functions as well as\nby solving the linearized Toda equation in the simplest case of sine-Liouville deformation.\nThen we showed that these results have a natural interpretation in terms of a bosonic\ncollective field, whose oscillator modes are in correspondence with the Toda couplings tk .\nThe fermion bilinears then can be represented as vertex operators of this bosonic field,\neq. (5.14). The subleading corrections are proportional to the exponent of the two-point\nbosonic correlation function, eq. (5.30).\nIt is natural to expect that the NPC have their origin in the D-branes of the string\ntheory. In order to have such an interpretation, they should be expressed in terms of world\nsheets with local boundary conditions. Such an interpretation exists for the eigenvalue x of\nthe random matrix variable, which is the boundary cosmological constant for the Liouville\nfield.\nOn the other hand, our results were derived in terms of the chiral phase-space coordinates, x+ and x\u2212 , which do not have direct interpretation in terms of local conformal\nboundary conditions in the world-sheet theory. Therefore, to find the meaning of the nonperturbative corrections as the effects due to D-branes, we should first translate the results\nobtained in the (x+ , x\u2212 ) representation back to the (x, p) representation.\nAssuming that tk = t\u2212k and that there is a finite number of non-vanishing couplings,\nthe parametric form of the curve in the (x, p) space is obtained directly from (2.30):\nx(\u03c4 ) =\n\n\u221a\n\nkX\nmax\nh\n1\n2 e\u2212 2R \u03c7 cosh \u03c4 +\nak cosh (1 \u2212\nk=1\n\np(\u03c4 ) =\n\n\u221a\n\n1\n\u03c7\n\u2212 2R\n\n2e\n\nh\nsinh \u03c4 +\n\nkX\nmax\nk=1\n\nk\n)\u03c4\nR\n\n\u0001i\n,\n\n(6.1)\n\n\u0001i\nk\nak sinh (1 \u2212 R\n)\u03c4 .\n\nThe FZZT curve is the one for the resolvent y = w(x). The latter is related to the\nmomentum p by\nw(ei\u03c0 x) \u2212 w(e\u2212i\u03c0 x)\n.\n(6.2)\np(x) =\n2i\n27\n\n\fThis equation is easy to solve only in the case of stationary background, where the two\nsides of the cut of w(x) are the images of the straight lines Im \u03c4 = \u00b1\u03c0, and whose solution\nis given by (4.13). In the case of a time-dependent background the two sides of the cut\nof w(x) are parametrized by the lines \u03c4\u00b1 (t) = t \u00b1 i\u03c01 (t), t > 0, where \u03c01 (t) \u2192 \u03c0 only\nasymptotically at t \u2192 \u00b1\u221e. Therefore eq. (6.2) can be written more explicitly as\np(\u03c4 ) =\n\nw(\u03c4 + i\u03c01 (\u03c4 )) \u2212 w(\u03c4 \u2212 i\u03c01 (\u03c4 ))\n,\n2i\n\n(6.3)\n\nwhere the function \u03c01 (t) is obtained as the solution of the transcendental equation\nsin \u03c01 +\n\nkX\nmax\nk=1\n\n\u0001\nk\n)t\nsinh (1 \u2212 R\nsin (1 \u2212\nak\nsinh t\n\nk\nR )\u03c01\n\n\u0001\n\n= 0,\n\nt \u2208 R.\n\n(6.4)\n\nAs a consequence, the parameter \u03c4 does not uniformize the curve y = w(x). In general,\nw(\u03c4 ) will have infinitely many branch points.\nConsidered at t = 0, eq. (6.4) coincides with the condition that \u2202\u03c4 x = 0 for purely\nimaginary \u03c4 . Therefore the point \u03c4 = \u00b1i\u03c01 (0) is a branch point for p(x). It is easy to\nsee that all purely imaginary solutions of (6.4) correspond to branch points of p(x). The\nsolutions of (6.4) can be classified by their asymptotics at infinity: \u03c0n (t) \u2192 n\u03c0.\nThe equation (6.4) for \u03c0n (\u03c4 ) is not compatible with the transcendental equation (4.25)\nfor the parameters \u03b8n of the double points, except for the stationary background. Therefore, for time-dependent backgrounds the double points never occur at the branch points\nof the resolvent or along its cuts. This fact can be geometrically understood by considering the classical trajectory x(i\u03b8) in imaginary time direction. The branch points are the\nturning points of the classical trajectory, while the double points are associated with its\nintersection points. Therefore, turning on a time-dependent tachyon background resolve\nthe infinite degeneracy of the double points of the complex curve for the c = 1 string\ntheory.\nNow let us return to the interpretation of the non-perturbative corrections in terms of\nD-branes. For the leading non-perturbative effects, which are given by the closed contour\nintegrals Sn (4.28), this was done in [13,14]. Using the relation (D.10) of the light-cone\ncoordinates to the spectral density and (6.2), one obtains\nI\n\u0001\n1\ndx w(ei\u03c0 x) \u2212 w(e\u2212i\u03c0 x) .\n(6.5)\nSn = \u2212 2\n\u03b3n\n\nThe resolvent w(x) is equal to the derivative of the FZZT disk partition function with\nrespect to the boundary cosmological constant x:\nw(x) = \u2202x \u03a6F ZZT (x).\n28\n\n(6.6)\n\n\fTaking into account the symmetry w(ei\u03c0 x(\u03c4 )) = w(e\u2212i\u03c0 x(\u2212\u03c4 )) of the resolvent, this allows\nto identify\n\u2212Sn = \u03a6F ZZT (e\u2212i\u03c0 x(i\u03b8n )) \u2212 \u03a6F ZZT (ei\u03c0 x(i\u03b8n )).\n(6.7)\nIn [13] it was also checked in the first order in the deformation coupling \u03bb that the\nleading correction is given by the ZZ disk partition function\n\u2212Sn = \u03a6ZZ (n, 1)\n\n(6.8)\n\nso that the n-th double point of the complex curve is associated to the (n, 1) ZZ brane.\nAssuming that this equation remains to be true in the full deformed theory, from (6.7) and\n(6.8) we conclude that the ZZ partition function is equal to the difference of two FZZT\npartition functions calculated from two sides of the double point. This is a generalization\nto the case of a general tachyon deformation of a similar identity in the non-deformed\ntheory (\u03bb = 0). [7,25,54,55].\nNote that our analysis also reveals the distinguished role of the (1, 1) ZZ brane. Up\nto now it was the only one which played a role in the interpretation of matrix models as\ntheories of open strings. In our context it is associated with the first double point of the\ncomplex curve. One can show that this is the only double point which is situated on the\nphysical sheet of the Riemann surface. It is natural to expect that this fact corresponds\nto the observation in CFT that the (n, 1) ZZ branes with n > 1 possess some pathological\nproperties [24]. However, if we are calculating the non-perturbative corrections to observables that explore lower sheets of the Riemann surface, than the other double points may\nbecome relevant.\nThe world-sheet interpretation of the subleading order of NPC seems to be a more\ncomplicated problem. It is expected to be related to the annulus amplitude on ZZ brane.\nHowever, the expression given for this amplitude in [16] diverges in this case. One may\n\u22121\nattempt to relate this divergence to the factor (log \u039b) in (4.37). But in this way we can\nnot explain the universal non-trivial functional dependence on the couplings. On the other\nhand, our results are naturally expressed in terms of the two-point amplitude of a gaussian\nfield whose left and right components are associated with the incoming and outgoing\ntachyons. It is not however obvious how to reformulate them in terms of the annulus open\nstring amplitude on FZZT branes, which is defined in terms of the eigenvalue x.\nAcknowledgments\nThe authors would like to thank V.

Applying this\ncondition to the deformed wave functions (2.24), one obtains that it is satisfied for a\ndiscrete set of energies En (n \u2208 ZZ) defined by\nX\n\u03c6(En ) \u2212 En log \u039b + V (\u039b) + 2\u03c0n = 0,\nV (\u039b) =\n(tk + t\u2212k )\u039bk/2R .\n(A.2)\nk\n\nFrom (A.2) one can find the density of the energy levels in the confined system\n\u03c1(E) =\n\nlog \u039b\n1 d\u03c6(E)\n\u2212\n.\n2\u03c0\n2\u03c0 dE\n\n(A.3)\n\nNow the free energy F (\u03bc, R) = log Z(\u03bc, R) of the fermionic system compactified at\ndistance \u03b2 = 2\u03c0R can be calculated using (2.13) with the density (A.3).

The c = 0 critical limit for the subleading contribution\nIt is well known [56] that sine-Liouville theory exhibits a critical behavior when sineLiouville coupling becomes sufficiently large. Physically, at the critical point the fluctuations of the matter field get frozen in minima of sine potential. As a result, the system\napproaches the c = 0 CFT describing pure two-dimensional gravity.\nIn [10,11] it was shown that the leading non-perturbative correction to the partition\nfunction corresponding to n = 1 follows the same pattern, whereas other corrections with\nn > 1 disappear in the c = 0 critical limit. Thus, we expect that A1 (y) must exhibit a\nsingularity as y \u2192 yc with\nR\n\n1\u2212R\n\nyc = \u2212(2R \u2212 1)R\u2212 2R\u22121 (1 \u2212 R) 2R\u22121\n\n(C.1)\n\nand, furthermore, the behavior of A1 near this singularity should reproduce the nonperturbative effects of the c = 0 theory\n1/2\n\nA1 \u223c gstr,c=0 \u223c (y \u2212 yc )\u22125/8 .\n\n(C.2)\n\nIndeed, the singularity at y = yc corresponds to a critical point of (2.23), near which\nthe relation between y and X degenerates:\n\u0001\nyc \u2212 y\n1\u2212R\n\u2243\n(X \u2212 Xc )2 + O (X \u2212 Xc )3 .\n(C.3)\nyc\n2R\n\nAt the critical point \u03b81 \u2192 0 and the first two terms in the expansion of \u03b81 around the\nsingularity are\n\u221a\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u221a\n3(2R2 \u2212 2R + 1)\n3/2\n5/2\n1/2\n\u03b81 (y) = 3(Xc \u2212 X) \u2212\n(X\n\u2212\nX)\n+\nO\n(X\n\u2212\nX)\n.

Quasiclassical wave function in the x-representation\nIn this appendix we study the quasiclassical wave function of the deformed fermionic system\nin the x-representation where x is the usual fermion coordinate related to eigenvalues of\nMQM. The simplest way to get this function is to use the result (4.15) together with (4.23)\nfor the same wave function in the light-cone representation. Then it is enough to apply a\nunitary operator relating the two representations.\nThis unitary operator can be represented as an integral operator with kernel defined\nas a solution of the following equations\n1\n\u221a (x \u2213 i\u2202x ) |xihx\u00b1 | = x\u00b1 |xihx\u00b1 |,\n2\n\n(D.1)\n\n\u0011\n\u0001\u2217\n\u0001\u2217\n1 \u0010\n\u221a x\u00b1 \u00b1 i\u2202x\u00b1 |xihx\u00b1 | = x |xihx\u00b1 | .\n2\n\n(D.2)\n\nIt is easy to check that it is given by\n\n1\n\u2213i\n|xihx\u00b1 | = 1/4 \u221a e 2\n2\n\u03c0\n\n\u221a\nx2 \u22122 2xx\u00b1 +x2\n\n\u00b1\n\n\u0001\n\n.\n\n(D.3)\n\nThen one obtains (the same result will be for the \"x\u2212 \" representation)\n\u03a8 (x) =\nE\n\n=\n\nZ\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n0\n\u221e\n0\n\ndx+ |xihx+ |\u03a8E\n+ (x+ )\ne\u2212i\u03c6+\n\u2212i\ne 2\ndx+ 3/4 p\n2 \u03c0 \u2202 \u03c4 x+\n\n\u0001\nRx\n\u221a\n+ X (x\u2032 )dx\u2032\nx2 \u22122 2xx+ +x2 +2\n+\n+\n\u2212\n+\n\n\u221e\n\n(D.4)\n.\n\nThe integral can be calculated by the saddle point method.
