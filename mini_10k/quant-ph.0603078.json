It has been conjectured that quantum cloning becomes equivalent to state estimation\nin the asymptotic regime where the number of clones tends to infinity. We prove this conjecture\nusing two known results of Quantum Information Theory: the monogamy of quantum correlations\nand the properties of entanglement breaking channels.\n\narXiv:quant-ph/0603078v1 9 Mar 2006\n\nPACS numbers: 03.65.-w, 03.67.-a\n\nThe impossibility of perfect state estimation is a major\nconsequence of the nonorthogonality of quantum states:\nthe state of a single quantum system cannot be perfectly\nmeasured. In other words, a measurement on a system in\norder to acquire information on its quantum state perturbs the system itself. The full reconstruction of the\nstate is only possible by computing statistical averages\nof different observables on a large number of identically\nprepared systems. Thus, any measurement at the singlecopy level only provides partial information.\nThe fact that state estimation is in general imperfect\nleads in a natural way to the problem of building optimal\nmeasurements. Being a perfect reconstruction impossible, it is relevant to find the measurement strategy that\nmaximizes the gain of information about the unknown\nstate. A standard approach to this problem in Quantum\nInformation Theory (QIT) is to quantify the quality of a\nmeasurement by means of the so-called fidelity [1]. This\nquantity is defined as follows. Consider the situation in\nwhich a quantum state |\u03c8i is chosen from the ensemble\n{pi , |\u03c8i i}, i.e. |\u03c8i can be equal to |\u03c8i i with probability\npi . A measurement, defined by NM positive\noperators,\nP\nMj \u2265 0, summing up to the identity, j Mj = 11, is applied on this unknown state. For each obtained outcome\nj, a guess |\u03c6j i for the input state is made. The overlap\nbetween the guessed state and the input state, |h\u03c8i |\u03c6j i|2 ,\nquantifies the quality of the estimation process. The averaged fidelity of the measurement then reads\nX\npi tr(Mj |\u03c8i ih\u03c8i |) |h\u03c8i |\u03c6j i|2 .\n(1)\nF\u0304M =\n\noptimal cloning machines [4]. In this case, one looks\nfor the quantum map L that, given a state |\u03c8i chod\nsen from an ensemble {pi , |\u03c8i i} in C , produces a state\nd\nL(\u03c8) = \u03c1C1 ...CN in (C )\u2297N , such that each individual\nclone \u03c1Ck = trk\u0304 (\u03c1C1 ...CN ) resembles as much as possible\nthe input state, where trk\u0304 denotes the trace with respect\nto all the systems C1 , . . . , CN but Ck . The average fidelity of the cloning process is then\n\nA measurement is optimal according to the fidelity criterion when it provides the largest possible value of F\u0304M ,\ndenoted in what follows by FM .\nThe No-cloning theorem [2], one of the cornerstones\nof QIT [3], represents another known consequence of the\nnonorthogonality of quantum states. It proves that given\na quantum system in an unknown state |\u03c8i, it is impossible to design a device producing two identical copies,\n|\u03c8i|\u03c8i. Indeed, two nonorthogonal quantum states suffice to prove the no-cloning theorem.\nAs it happens for state estimation, the impossibility of perfect cloning leads to the characterization of\n\nLater, this equality was rigorously shown to hold in the\ncases of (i) universal cloning [7], where the initial end\nsemble consists of an arbitrary pure state in C , chosen\nwith uniform probability, and (ii) phase covariant qubit\ncloning [8], where the initial ensemble corresponds to a\n2\nstate in C lying on one of the equators of the Bloch\nsphere. Since then, the validity of this equality for any\nensemble has been conjectured and, indeed, has been\nidentified as one of the open problems in QIT [9].\nIn this work, we show that the fidelities of optimal\nasymptotic cloning and of state estimation are indeed\nequal for any initial ensemble of pure states. Actually, we\n\ni,j\n\nF\u0304C (N ) =\n\nX\ni,k\n\npi\n\n1\nh\u03c8i |trk\u0304 L(\u03c8i )|\u03c8i i.\nN\n\n(2)\n\nThe goal of the optimal machine is to maximize this\nquantity, this optimal value being denoted by FC (N ).\nOne can easily realize that the no-cloning theorem and\nthe impossibility of perfect state estimation are closely\nrelated. On the one hand, if perfect state estimation was\npossible, one could use it to prepare any number of clones\nof a given state, just by measurement and preparation.\nOn the other hand, if perfect cloning was possible, one\ncould perfectly estimate the unknown state of a quantum system by preparing infinite clones of it and then\nmeasuring them. Beyond these qualitative arguments,\nthe connection between state estimation and cloning was\nstrengthened in [5, 6]. The results of these works suggested that asymptotic cloning, i.e. the optimal cloning\nprocess when N \u2192 \u221e, is equivalent to state estimation,\nin the sense that\nFC = FC (N \u2192 \u221e) = FM .\n\n(3)\n\n\f2\nprove that asymptotic cloning does effectively correspond\nto state estimation, from which the equality of the two\nfidelities trivially follows. The proof of this equivalence\nis based on two known results of QIT: the monogamy of\nquantum correlations and the properties of the so-called\nentanglement breaking channels (EBC).\nIt is easy to prove that FM \u2264 FC . Indeed, given the\ninitial state |\u03c8i, a possible asymptotic cloning map, not\nnecessarily optimal, consists of first applying state estimation and then preparing infinite copies of the guessed\nstate. It is sometimes said that the opposite has to be\ntrue since \"asymptotic cloning cannot represent a way\nof circumventing optimal state estimation\". As already\nmentioned in [9], this reasoning is too naive, since it neglects the role correlations play in state estimation. For\ninstance, take the simplest case of universal cloning of a\n2\nqubit, i.e. a state in C isotropically distributed over the\nBloch sphere. The optimal cloning machines produces\nN approximate clones pointing in the same direction in\nthe Bloch sphere as the input state, but with a shrunk\nBloch vector [7]. If the output of the asymptotic cloning\nmachine was in a product form, it would be possible to\nperfectly estimate the direction of the local Bloch vector,\nwhatever the shrinking was. Then, a perfect estimation\nof the initial state would be possible. And of course, after the perfect estimation one could prepare an infinite\nnumber of perfect clones! This simple reasoning shows\nthat the correlations between the clones play an important role in the discussion. Actually, it has recently been\nshown that the correlations present in the output of the\nuniversal cloning machine are the worst for the estimation of the reduced density matrix [10].\nAs announced, the proof of the conjecture is based on\ntwo known results of QIT: the monogamy of entanglement and the properties of EBC. For the sake of completeness, we state here these results, without proof.\nQuantum correlations, or entanglement, represent a\nmonogamous resource, in the sense that they cannot be\narbitrarily shared. One of the strongest results in this\ndirection was obtained by Werner in 1989 [11]. There,\nit was shown that the only states that can be arbitrarily\nshared are the separable ones. Recall that a bipartite\nd\nd\nquantum state \u03c1AC in C \u2297 C is said to be N -shareable\nwhen it is possible to find a quantum state \u03c1AC1 ...CN in\nd\nd\nC \u2297 (C )\u2297N such that \u03c1ACk = trk\u0304 \u03c1AC1 ...CN = \u03c1AC , \u2200k.\nThe state \u03c1AC1 ...CN is then said to be an N -extension of\n\u03c1AC . The initial correlations between subsystems A and\nC are now shared between A and each of the N subsystems Ci , see Fig. 1. It is straightforward to see that\n\n\u03c1AC1 ...CN =\n\nX\ni\n\nqi |\u03b1i ih\u03b1i | \u2297 |\u03b3i ih\u03b3i |\u2297N\n\n(4)\n\ngives\na valid N -extension of a separable state \u03c1sAC =\nP\ni qi |\u03b1i ih\u03b1i | \u2297 |\u03b3i ih\u03b3i | for all N . As proven by Werner,\n\nr AC\n\nr AC 1 C 2 K C N =\n\nA\n\nC1\n\nr AC\n\nC2\nr AC\n\nr AC\n\nA\n\nCi\n\nCN\n\nFIG. 1: The state \u03c1AC is said to be N -shareable when there\nexists a global state \u03c1AC1 ...CN such that the local state shared\nbetween A and Ci is equal to \u03c1AC , for all i.\n\nif the state is entangled, there exists a finite N where no\nvalid extension can be found.\nThe second ingredient needed in what follows are the\nproperties of EBC. A channel \u03a5 is said to be entanglement breaking when it cannot be used to distribute\nentanglement. In Ref. [12] it was proven that the following three statements are equivalent: (1) \u03a5 is entanglement\nP breaking, (2) \u03a5 can be written in the form\n\u03a5(\u03c1) = j tr(Mj \u03c1)\u03c1j , where \u03c1j are quantum states and\n{Mj } defines a measurement and (3) \u221a\n(11 \u2297 \u03a5)|\u03a6+ i is a\nP\nseparable state, where |\u03a6+ i = i |iii/ d is a maximally\nd\nd\nentangled state in C \u2297 C . The equivalence of (1) and\n(2) simply means that any EBC can be understood as the\nmeasurement of the input state, \u03c1, followed by the preparation of a new state \u03c1j depending on the obtained outcome. The equivalence of (1) and (3) reflects that the intuitive strategy for entanglement distribution where half\nof a maximally entangled state is sent through the channel is enough to detect if \u03a5 is entanglement breaking.\nAfter collecting all these results, we are now ready to\nprove the following\nTheorem: Asymptotic cloning corresponds to state\nestimation. Thus, FM = FC for any ensemble of states.\nProof: The idea of the proof is to characterize the\nquantum maps L associated to asymptotic cloning machines. First of all, note that, for any number of clones,\nwe can restrict our considerations to symmetric cloning\nmachines, Ls , where the clones are all in the same state.\nIndeed, given a machine where this is not the case, one\ncan construct a symmetric machine achieving the same\nfidelity FC (N ), just by making a convex combination of\nall the permutations of the N clones [13]. Now, denote\nby Lc the effective cloning map consisting of, first, the\napplication of a symmetric machine Ls and then tracing\nall but one of the clones, say the first one. The cloning\nproblem can be rephrased as, see Eq. (2),\nX\npi h\u03c8i |Lc (\u03c8i )|\u03c8i i.\n(5)\nmax\nc\nL\ni\nNote that this maximization runs over all channels that\n\n\f3\ncan be written as Lc = tr1\u0304 Ls . For instance, the identity\nmap, where \u03c8 \u2192 \u03c8, \u2200\u03c8, does not satisfy this constraint.\nIf the N -cloning map is applied to half of a maximally\nentangled state, the resulting state,\n\u03c1AC1 ...CN = (11A \u2297 LsB )|\u03a6+ iAB ,\n\n(6)\n\nis such that, for all i,\n\u03c1ACi = (11 \u2297 Lc )|\u03a6+ i = \u03c1AC .\n\n(7)\n\nThat is, the output of the N -cloning machine acting on\nhalf of a maximally entangled state is a valid N -extension\nof \u03c1AC . When taking the limit of an infinite number of\nclones, and because of the monogamy of entanglement,\nthis implies that \u03c1AC has to be separable and, thus, Lc is\nentanglement breaking (7). Since any EBC can be seen as\nmeasurement followed by state preparation, asymptotic\ncloning (5) can be written as [14]\nX\npi tr(Mj |\u03c8i ih\u03c8i |) |h\u03c8i |\u03c6j i|2 ,\n(8)\nmax\n{Mj ,\u03c6j }\n\ni,j\n\nwhich defines the optimal state estimation problem.\nTherefore, FM = FC for any ensemble of states. \u0003\nThe same argument applies to the case in which L\ncopies of the initial state |\u03c8i are given. The measurement\nand cloning fidelities now read, see Eqs. (1) and (2),\nX\npi tr(Mj |\u03c8i ih\u03c8i |\u2297L ) |h\u03c8i |\u03c6j i|2\nF\u0304M (L) =\ni,j\n\nF\u0304C (N, L) =\n\nX\ni,k\n\npi\n\n1\nh\u03c8i |trk\u0304 L(\u03c8i\u2297L )|\u03c8i i.\nN\n\n(9)\n\nUsing the same ideas as in the previous Theorem, it is\nstraightforward to prove that\nFM (L) = FC (N \u2192 \u221e, L),\n\n(10)\n\nwhere FM (L) and FC (N, L) denote the optimal values of\nF\u0304M (L) and F\u0304C (N, L), as above.\nOne can also extend this result to asymmetric scenarios. An asymmetric cloning machine [16], given an initial\ninput state |\u03c8i, produces NA clones of fidelity FC (NA )\nand NB clones of fidelity FC (NB ). The machine is optimal when it gives the largest FC (NB ) for fixed FC (NA ).\nIn the case of measurement, we are thinking of measurement strategies where the goal is to obtain information on\nan unknown state introducing the minimal disturbance.\nAs above, we consider that a guess for the input state is\ndone depending on the measurement outcome. The information vs disturbance trade-off can again be expressed\nin terms of fidelities [15]: the information gain is given\nby the overlap, G, between the initial and the guessed\nstate, while the disturbance is quantified by the overlap, F , between the state after the measurement and the\ninitial state. A measurement is optimal when for fixed\n\ndisturbance, F , it provides the largest value of G. The\noptimal trade-off between F and G has been derived in\n[15] for the case in which the input ensemble consists of\nd\nany pure state in C with uniform probability.\nAs it happens for the symmetric case, a connection\nbetween this state estimation problem and asymmetric\ncloning machines can be expected when NA = 1 and\nNB \u2192 \u221e. Indeed, the previous measurement strategy\ngives a possible realization of this asymptotic and asymmetric cloning machine, not necessarily optimal. Actually, when the input state is any pure state, with uniform\nprobability, the optimal measurement strategy of [15]\nturns out to saturate the optimal cloning 1 \u2192 NA + NB\nfidelities of [17], with NA = 1 and NB \u2192 \u221e. Now,\nthe equality between the measurement and asymptotic\ncloning fidelities in the asymmetric scenario for any ensemble of input states can be proven using the same arguments as above: one has to symmetrize the NB clones\nand then use the connection with entanglement shareability and EBC when NB \u2192 \u221e.\nFrom a more speculative point of view, there exist several works relating the impossibility of perfect cloning\nto the no-signaling principle, namely the impossibility of\nhaving faster-than-light communication (see for instance\n[18]). Actually, a no-cloning theorem can be derived just\nfrom the no-signaling principle, without invoking any additional quantum feature [19]. In view of the strong connection between cloning and state estimation, it would\nbe interesting to study whether a similar link between\nthe no-signaling principle and the impossibility of perfect state estimation could also be established.\nTo conclude, this work proves the long-standing conjecture on the equivalence between asymptotic cloning\nand state estimation. It represents the strongest link\nbetween two fundamental no-go theorems of Quantum\nMechanics, namely the impossibilities of perfect cloning\nand state estimation.\nWe thank Emili Bagan, John Calsamiglia, Sofyan Iblisdir and Ramon Mu\u00f1oz-Tapia for discussion.
