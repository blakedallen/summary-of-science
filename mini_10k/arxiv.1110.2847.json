We study their sensitivity to the size of the valence parton distribution in the nucleon.\n\n\u00a71.\n\nIntroduction\n\nSpacetime evolution of the hot and dense system created from heavy ion collisions at Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) or Large Hadron Collider (LHC)\nmay be followed by hydrodynamical simulations. Indeed, the nearly perfect fluid\npicture appears to explain large elliptic flow discovered at RHIC and LHC. Recently,\nit was reported the effects of initial condition for hydrodynamics on the higher order\nflow harmonics in Au+Au collisions at RHIC1) by comparing various hydrodynamical models with different initial conditions.2)\u20134) Combined analysis of higher order\nflow harmonics may provide strong constraints on both the properties of QGP and\nthe initial higher order moments of the density distribution of gluons in coordinate\nspace.5) It was pointed out in Ref.6) that all moments have the same magnitude\nwhen there is no length scale for nucleons inside a nucleus, while their magnitude\ndecreases with the harmonic number if a length scale is introduced. In this work,\nwe compute higher order harmonic moments within Monte-Carlo version of kt factorization formulation with running coupling BK equation, and study the effect of\nGaussian width on the harmonic moments.\n\u00a72.\n\nTheoretical Model\n\nWe will use the Monte-Carlo implementation of kt formula with unintegrated\ngluon distribution function from numerical solutions of running coupling BalitskyKovchegov (MCrcBK)7), 8) equation for the computation of gluon production in\nheavy ion collisions. This model is a extension of the Monte-Carlo KLN (MC-KLN)\nmodel.9) First, the nucleons in the two incident nuclei are randomly sampled according to the Woods-Saxon distribution which simulates the effects of fluctuations\nof position of hard color sources. At each grid point, we compute the thickness function TA (r\u22a5 ) to obtain the local saturation scale and then compute the gluon density.\nWithin a Gaussian nucleon approximation, thickness function (for the large-x valence\npartons) is given by\n1\nTp (r) =\nexp[\u2212r 2 /(2B)] .\n(2.1)\n2\u03c0B\ntypeset using P T P TEX.cls hVer.0.9i\n\n\f2\n\nYasushi Nara\n\nNote that the mean square radius of the valence parton distribution corresponds to\nhr 2 i = 2B. The probability of nucleon-nucleon collision P (b) at impact parameter b\nis\nZ\nP (b) = 1 \u2212 exp[\u2212kTpp (b)],\nTpp (b) = d2 s Tp (s) Tp (s \u2212 b) .\n(2.2)\nwhere (perturbatively) k corresponds to the product of gluon-gluon cross section and\ngluon density squared. We fix k so that integral over impact parameter becomes the\nnucleon-nucleon inelastic cross section \u03c3N N at the given energy:\nZ\n\u0001\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u03c3N N ( s) = d2 b 1 \u2212 exp[\u2212k( s) Tpp (b)] ,\n(2.3)\n\n\u221a\nwith \u03c3N N = 61.36 mb for sN N = 2.76 TeV. Hence, P (b) broadens with increasing\nenergy, even as the size B of the hard valence partons is fixed.\nIn this work, we vary the width of the Gaussian within the range B = 0.2, 0.3, 0.4\nfm2 . Our model applies the kt -factorized formula in the transverse plane perpendicular to the beam axis locally. The number distribution of produced gluons is given\nby\nZ 2 Z p\u22a5\ndNg\nNc\nd p\u22a5\n\u223c 2\nd2 k\u22a5 \u03b1s \u03c6A (x1 , (k\u22a5 + p\u22a5 )2 ) \u03c6B (x2 , (k\u22a5 \u2212 p\u22a5 )2 ) .\n2\nd r\u22a5 dy\nNc \u2212 1\np2\u22a5\n(2.4)\n7)\nIn MCrcBK, \u03c6 is obtained from the Fourier transform of the numerical results of\nthe running coupling BK (rcBK) evolution equation.10) Note that in (2.4) the smallx evolution is not treated stochastically and that the density of produced gluons\nfluctuates only due to fluctuations of the large-x valence charges.\n\u00a73.\n\nInitial Harmonic moments\n\nIn Fig. 1, we plot the event average of eccentricities \u03b5n (n = 2, 3, 4, 5) defined\nas11)\np\nhr 2 cos(n\u03c6)i2 + hr 2 sin(n\u03c6)i2\n\u03b5n =\n(3.1)\nhr 2 i\nwhere r 2 = x2 +y 2 , x = r cos \u03c6, y = r sin \u03c6. h* * * i means the average in the transverse\nplane. Since the eccentricities may be proportional to the magnitude of flows, it is\nimportant to know the initial value of these quantities. The result from Monte-Carlo\nGlauber model in which eccentricity is calculated based on the positions of point-like\nparticipant nucleons that is labeled by Glauber (point-like) is shown in full squares.\nMonte-Carlo Glauber results assuming hard disc nucleon are plotted in open squares.\nIn the hard disc approximation, the thickness function at each grid is obtained by\nwithin S\ncounting the number of participant nucleons as TA (r\u22a5 ) = number of nucleon\n,\nS\nwhere the smearing area S = 42 mb, at top RHIC energy. The finite size of the nucleons does not affect \u03b52 significantly, except for very peripheral collisions. However,\nGlauber with point-like nucleons yields larger values for higher moments (n \u2265 3)\nwhich is consistent with the results in Ref.6)\n\n\f3\n\nHarmonic moments\n\n0.8\n\n0.4\n\n0.2\n\n0\n0\n\nGlauber (point-like)\nGlauber (hard disc)\nHard disc\nB=0.2 fm22\nB=0.3 fm2\nB=0.4 fm\n\n0.3\n\u03b53\n\n0.6\n\u03b52\n\n0.4\n\nGlauber (point-like)\nGlauber (hard disc)\nHard disc\nB=0.2 fm22\nB=0.3 fm2\nB=0.4 fm\n\n0.2\n\n0.1\n\n100\n\n0.5\n\n200\nNpart\n\n300\n\n0\n0\n\n400\n\n0.4\n\nGlauber (point-like)\nGlauber (hard disc)\nHard disc\nB=0.2 fm22\nB=0.3 fm2\nB=0.4 fm\n\n0.4\n\n200\nNpart\n\n300\n\n400\n\nGlauber (point-like)\nGlauber (hard disc)\nHard disc\nB=0.2 fm22\nB=0.3 fm2\nB=0.4 fm\n\n0.3\n\u03b55\n\n\u03b54\n\n0.3\n\n100\n\n0.2\n\n0.2\n0.1\n\n0.1\n0\n0\n\n100\n\n200\nNpart\n\n300\n\n400\n\n0\n0\n\n100\n\n200\nNpart\n\n300\n\n400\n\nFig. 1.

We have shown the length scale dependence of the harmonic\nmoments of the initial density distribution. It will be interesting to see how this\naffects higher order hydrodynamical flows. Also, in the future it would be interesting to systematically explore the effect of additional fluctuations from the BFKL\nevolution ladders.14)\nAcknowledgments\nI thank J. Albacete, A.
