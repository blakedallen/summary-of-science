The dynamics of the latter are\ngoverned by an effective force F generated by a scalar\npotential that represents the collective motion of the fast\ndegrees of freedom, i.e. the electrons. According to the\nHellmann-Feynman theorem[1]\nF = \u2212\u2207 \u000f(R)\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u000f is the Born-Oppenheimer energy (including\nhigher-order corrections[2]) of the electronic state and R\ntypically describes the geometry of the atomic ensemble.\nMolecular spectroscopy, atomic collision phenomena, as\nwell as molecular dynamics simulations are just some of\nthe applications that derive their utility from the implications of Eq. (1). In its modern expression[3\u20135] BO\ntheory also allows for an additional contribution to Eq.\n(1), that of an induced effective \"magnetic\" force[5\u20138]\nv\nv\n\u00d7B\u2212B\u00d7\n2\n2\nB = \u2207 \u00d7 ~A\n\nFm \u2261\n\n(2)\n\nwhere v is the atom velocity operator[5] and A is a vector potential. This effective force is sometimes called\ngeometric magnetism, a term coined by M.V. Berry, and\nis the nomenclature we adopt here.\nAdvances[9\u201314] in the manipulation of cold atomic\nmatter has allowed researchers to \"dress\" atoms via the\napplication of laser fields in order to induce gauge potentials that manifest as effective Lorentz forces on the\natoms. This phenomenon has been called, \"artificial\"[13]\n\nor \"synthetic\"[10] magnetism and in a laboratory realization of it[9], a BEC cloud was observed to undergo\ncyclotron motion in the same manner charged particles\nbehave in a magnetic field. The effect has important implications for the control of atomic matter, and offers a\nnovel route to quantum magnetism[12, 15].\nIn this paper we address the question; what is the relationship between geometric and induced synthetic magnetism? The appearance of vector gauge potentials in\nmolecular physics was first demonstrated by Mead and\nTruhlar[16] in their study of pathologies associated with\nconical intersections (degeneracies of distinct BO molecular energies at an isolated point Rc ). At a conical intersection the phase of the BO wavefunction is undefined\nand, in order to avoid multi-valuedness, Mead and Truhlar introduced a compensating phase factor to accompany the nuclear wavefunction. They argued that such\na procedure is equivalent to minimally coupling the nuclear motion with a non-trivial vector potential[16]. The\nMead-Truhlar gauge potential does not exhibit geometric\nmagnetism but since Berry's vector potential[6, 17] has\nnon-vanishing curl, systems exhibiting the latter do. In\nthe Mead-Truhlar treatment degeneracy plays a central\nrole as it does in Berry's Hamiltonian[17]. Degeneracy\nis also an essential ingredient in the non-Abelian generalization of Berry's phase[18]. Thus the appearance of\ngeometric phases has historically been associated with\nsystems in which degeneracies manifest. This does not\nappear to be the case for artificial magnetism[13] and\nso it is worthwhile to further investigate the relationship\nbetween the two phenomena.\nIn applications[19\u201321] it is often necessary to go beyond BO theory and exploit a multi-channel generalization of it, the Born-Huang expansion or the method of\nperturbed stationary states (PSS)[22]. In atomic collision\ntheory the latter lead to equations that have the form[5]\n~2\n(\u2207 \u2212 iA)2 F + V F = EF\n(3)\n2m\nwhere F is a multi-channel amplitude expressed as a col\u2212\n\n\u2217\n\nbernard@physics.unlv.edu\n\n\f2\numn matrix, A is a matrix-valued vector potential, and\nV is a diagonal scalar-valued matrix whose elements consist of the BO eigenvalues associated with each channel\nand E is the total energy eigenvalue. If a complete set of\nchannel states are included in the PSS expansion then Eq.\n(3) is exact. We distinguish two cases in applications of\nEq. (3). In the first, matrix V is degenerate at all R and\na gauge transformation can be found[5, 7] so that, in the\nnew gauge, A = 0. The representation in which A = 0 is\nsometimes called the diabatic picture[5, 23], whereas Eq.\n(3) describes dynamics in the adiabatic picture. The second case, which we deal with exclusively in this paper, V\nis non-degenerate and Eq. (3) exhibits gauge covariance\nif the vector valued potential A is taken as the spatial\ncomponent of a 3+1 gauge field that also contains a temporal component[5]. In applications[19\u201321] one typically\ntruncates the PSS equations to a finite number of channels (most realistic systems involve an infinite number of\nchannels) and in that case one cannot, in general, find a\ntransformation into a gauge where A = 0. As a consequence effective gauge forces[5, 19] manifest. Does this\nimply that the existence of the latter are the artifacts of\nan approximation procedure? What is the relationship\nbetween geometric forces and the fictitious forces that\narise in a classical description where non-inertial frames\nare employed?\nIn order to address these, and other questions, we introduce and analyze several low dimensional but solvable models that exhibit geometric phase phenomena in\nthe BO approximation. In the systems discussed here\nthe \"fast\" degrees of freedom span a finite Hilbert space\nof dimensions d = 2, 4. Similar models have been discussed previously[24\u201326] but here we focus on systems\nthat do not exhibit energy degeneracies in the adiabatic\napproximation. We concentrate our efforts on fully quantal treatments of Eq. (3) and we limit our discussion to\nscattering systems and their solution.\nIn section II we provide a general theoretical framework for the subsequent discussions. We introduce a 1D\nscattering system in which geometric phase phenomena\narise and which fully quantal analytic solutions are available. In section III we introduce a 2D scattering system\nthat exhibits the phenomenon of synthetic, or geometric,\nmagnetism. We compare the scattering solutions of it\nwith that obtained for a charged particle scattered by a\nferromagnetic slab. In the remaining sections we show\nhow these systems are related to ones in which geometric\nforces arise due to inter-particle interactions. An example\ninvolving two, interacting, spin-1/2 particles is presented.\nVector valued quantities will be shown in boldface, we\nwill announce matrix-valued quantities in the text and\nuse ordinary Roman typeface to represent them. However, in certain circumstance, where there might be a\npossibility for confusion, we will underline a Roman letter to stress its matrix nature.\n\nII.\nA.\n\nGeneral Theory\n\nConsider the Hamiltonian\nH=\u2212\n\n~2\n\u2207R 2 + Had (R)\n2m\n\n(4)\n\nwhere Had (R) is the Hamiltonian defined on an ndimensional Hilbert space hn that represents the internal,\nor \"fast\" [5], degrees of freedom of a quantum system of\nmass m. It is parameterized by the eigenvalues of the\nquantum variable R. In molecular physics Had is called\nthe adiabatic Hamiltonian and represents the total kinetic, electrostatic, and magnetic interactions among the\nelectrons. The kinetic energy term in Eq. (4) represents\nthe motion of the \"slow\" degrees of freedom. In molecular physics the internal space hn is spanned by the BornOppenheimer (BO) eigenstates of Had . Additional realizations described by Eq. (4) could be an atom, molecule\nor spin-n system in an external field that is modulated\nby the values of R. If we assume that the basis for hn is\nfinite, we can express\nHad (R) = U (R)HBO U \u2020 (R)\n\n(5)\n\nwhere HBO is a diagonal matrix whose entries we shall\nlabel e1 (R), e2 (R), ...en (R). In molecular physics they\nare called the BO eigenvalues for the electronic Hamiltonian Had . U (R) is a unitary operator acting on the\ninternal states and, in general, is also parameterized by\nR. Expressed as a matrix representation in the BO basis,\nU is an n \u00d7 n unitary matrix.\nAny well behaved Hermitian operator Had can be written in the form given by Eq. (5), however we require the\nadditional condition that U must be single-valued in the\nparameter space spanned by R. Consider the unitary\nmatrix,\nZ R\nW \u2020 (R) = P exp(i\ndR0 * A(R0 )) C\n(6)\nC\n\nwhere A is a vector valued n \u00d7 n matrix (i.e. a nonAbelian gauge potential), P represents a path-ordering\noperator and C is a constant unitary matrix. Pathordered integrals along curve C in parameter space R\nare defined as follows: Consider a path, C, defined by the\nset R1 , R2 , ...Rn where R1 = R(t1 ), R2 = R(t2 )...Rn =\nR(tn ), Rn = R, and t1 < t2 < ...tn defines a trajectory\nthat maps out the path. We define\nZ R\nP exp(i\ndR0 * A(R0 )) \u2261\nC\nZ tn\ndR(t)\nT exp(i\ndt\n* A(t))\n(7)\ndt\nt1\nwhere we assumed that the path is sufficiently smooth so\nthat dR(t)\nis well defined on it and T is the Dyson timedt\nordering operator. For open ended paths, such integrals\n\n\f3\nare also called the Wilson-line[27], and if C traces a closed\npath Eq. (6) represents the Wilson loop integral[28]\nwhich we require, for a pure gauge, to have the value\nof unity. To that end, we demand that\nF\u03bc\u03bd = \u2202u A\u03bd \u2212 \u2202\u03bd A\u03bc \u2212 i[A\u03bc , A\u03bd ] = 0\n\n(8)\n\nwhere we have used the notation defined in [5] and, here,\n\u03bc, \u03bd are spatial indices only. We make the assumption,\nif A satisfies condition Eq. (8) and is not singular, then\nthe value for path integral Eq. (6) is independent of C.\nWith this working assumption, we take the gradient of\nEq. (6)\n(9)\n\n(\u2207W \u2020 )W = \u2212W \u2020 \u2207W = iA\n\n(10)\n\nA = i W \u2020 \u2207W.\n\n(11)\n\nor\n\nand\n\nConsider a differentiable unitary operator U (R) so that\ni U \u2020 \u2207U = A, and therefore satisfies Eq. (8) [7, 39].\nSince U and W are both unitary and differentiable, W =\nU Z where Z = U \u22121 W . Inserting the expression for W\ninto the r.h.s. of Eq. (11) we obtain\nor\n\nThe unitary matrix Z that relates U with W must obey\nthe above constraint equation and represents a nonAbelian gauge transformation in which A remains invariant (e.g. for the Abelian case it requires that Z is\nconstant). If W and U differ, they do so up to an inconsequential gauge transformation. For example, if we\nreplace U in the adiabatic Hamiltonian, given in Eq. (5),\nwith W then Hamiltonian Eq. (4) is replaced with\n~2\n\u2207R 2 + W HBO W \u2020 .\nH0 = \u2212\n2m\nIt will follow from the discussion below that both H, and\nH 0 lead to identical Schrodinger equations in the adiabatic gauge since both formulations share the same vector and scalar gauge potentials. Therefore, we can always\nreplace the adiabatic Hamiltonian with one in which U\nis parameterized by a Wilson line as given by Eq. (6).\nB.\n\nWe note that U is single-valued and U (x = 0) is the\nidentity operator.\nSuppose the internal Hamiltonian is given by\nHad (x) = U0 HBO U0\u2020\n\n\u2207W \u2020 = i A W \u2020\n(\u2207W \u2020 )W = iA\n\ni W \u2020 \u2207W = A = Z \u2020 A Z + iZ \u2020 \u2207Z\n[Z, A] = i\u2207Z.\n\nwhere A0 , A1 are real constants. It is evident that condition Eq. (8) is satisfied by this gauge potential and we\ncan apply Eq. (6) to construct\n\u0012\n\u0013\nAx\nAx\ncos (Ax) \u2212 iA0 sin\n\u2212 iA1 sin\nA\nA\nU=\nAx\n\u2212 iA1 sin\ncos (Ax) + iA0 sin(Ax)\nA\nA\nq\n2\n2\nA \u2261 A1 + A0 .\n(13)\n\nIllustrative Example\n\nAs an illustration, consider the direct product of an\nhn = 2 dimensional Hilbert space of a two-level, or qubit,\nsystem and a 1D Hilbert space for quantum variable R,\ne.g. R is represented by the one-dimensional variable\n\u2212\u221e < x < \u221e. We define the gauge field\n\u0012\n\u0013\nA0 A1\nA=\n(12)\nA1 \u2212A0\n\n(14)\n\nwhere HBO is an arbitrary diagonal matrix. Previous\nstudies e.g. [16, 24] have focused on systems in which\nHBO is degenerate for some value of the parameter Rc ,\ni.e. e1 (Rc ) = e2 (Rc ). Here we do not allow any crossings, indeed we take the BO eigenergies to be constant\nthroughout the domain of x.

At collision energies where\nsome of the excited BO channels are closed, a common approximation in molecular and collision physics is\nto project the system of coupled equations (which are\nexact) onto the open sector. This is called the BornOppenheimer (BO) or, if several channels are open, the\nperturbed stationary states (PSS) approximation[5, 22].\nIn our example this approximation leads to the following\nsingle channel equation[5],\n(\u2202 + iA0 )2 Fo + k 2 Fo \u2212 b Fo = 0 x \u2265 0\n\u2202 2 Fo + k 2 Fo = 0 x < 0\nX\nb\u2261\nAik * Aki = A21\n\n(23)\n\nk6=i\n\nThe induced potential b is closely related to the so-called\n\"B\" term, or adiabatic, correction[2, 29, 30]. A gauge\ntransformation Fo \u2192 exp(\u2212iA0 x)Fo allows us to \"eliminate\" the derivative coupling in Eq. (23) and we can\nproceed to solve the scattering problem. Imposing the\nboundary condition that the open-channel wavefunction\nvanishes at x = L >> 0 (which is equivalent to the placement of an impenetrable barrier at L), we obtain, in the\nasymptotic region for x < 0,\nF0 (x) = exp(ik(x \u2212 L)) + R exp(\u2212ik(x \u2212 L))\nR = exp(\u22122ikL) \u00d7\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n2k\n\uf8ed\u22121 +\n\u0010 p\n\u0011 \uf8f8 k > |A1 |\np\nk + i k 2 \u2212 A21 cot L k 2 \u2212 A21\nand for k < |A1 |\nR = exp(\u22122ikL) \u00d7\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\u22121 +\n\n\uf8f6\n2k\n\nk+i\n\n\u0010 p\n\u0011\uf8f8 .\np\nA21 \u2212 k 2 coth L A21 \u2212 k 2\n\n(24)\n\nWe can also solve the fully coupled Eqs. (21) analytically, as outlined in the appendix, without resorting to\nthe Born-Oppenheimer approximation. That solution, in\nthe adiabatic limit, leads to\n\u0010\ntanh(A1 L) \u0011\nR = \u22121 + 2ik L \u2212\n+ O(k 2 ) + ... (25)\nA1\nwhere we have kept only the lowest order terms, as k \u2192 0,\nin an effective range expansion for R. This result is in\nharmony with that obtained in an effective range expansion of expression (24) obtained using the BO approximation.\nIn summary,\n\n\u2022 At collision energies where the excited internal\nstate is closed and the energy defect between the\nopen and closed channels is large, the lowest order\nterm in an effective range expansion (i.e. in the cold\ncollision energy regime) of the Born-Oppenheimer\nexpression for the reflection coefficient is identical to that obtained by solution of the fully coupled equations. It depends on the value of the offdiagonal component of the induced gauge potential\n(12) despite the fact that the pure gauge condition\nEq. (8) is satisfied.\n\u2022 In the BO approximation the off-diagonal gauge\ncoupling leads to a higher order induced scalar potential, given by the expression for b in Eq. (23).\nIn this approximation the diagonal component A0\ncan simply be \"gauged\" away and physical quantities, such as the scattering length, are independent\nof it.\n\u2022 At collision regimes where the BO approximation\nis no longer appropriate [31], (e.g. when \u2206 \u223c E),\nthe diagonal components A0 do affect scattering\nproperties. This may seem counter-intuitive since\nwe stated that a gauge transformation can be employed to transform these potentials away. One\nway of proceeding beyond BO theory is to describe\nthe coupling between the open and closed channel through the introduction of a non-local optical\npotential[32]. In such a treatment Eq. (23) is replaced by[33]\n2m\n(\u2202 + iA0 )2 Fo + k 2 Fo + 2 Vopt Fo = 0 x \u2265 0\n~\nZ\nVopt Fo \u2261 dx0 Vopt (x, x0 )Fo (x0 )\n(26)\nwhere Vopt is a nonlocal potential. Now the transformation Fo \u2192 exp(\u2212iA0 x)Fo does eliminate the\nderivative coupling in Eq. (26) but, since Vopt is\nnon-local, it results in\nZ\n\ndx0 Vopt (x, x0 )Fo (x0 ) \u2192\n\nZ\n\ndx0 Vopt (x, x0 ) exp(\u2212iA0 x0 )Fo (x0 )\n\nand it cannot simply be \"gauged\" away as in the\nBO approximation.\n\u2022 If the collision energy is sufficiently large so that\nE >> \u2206 and both channels are open the resulting\nscattering properties become independent of both\nA0 and A1 . In the case where the internal state\nenergy defect \u2206 can be neglected, we can treat A\nas a pure gauge, i.e. it does not affect the scattering\nproperties of the system.\n\n\f5\nIII.\n\ngauge potential (again here we limit ourselves to the\nh2 ) that satisfies the integrability condition Eq. (8),\nbut includes diagonal components that are non-trivial?\nThe answer is yes but we need to extend our parameter\nspace, at the least, into two dimensions i.e R = (x, y),\n\u2212\u221e < x, y < \u221e. Consider\n\nGEOMETRIC MAGNETISM\n\nThe model introduced above has interesting and salient\nproperties but it lacks the feature of geometric magnetism.

In\nseeking scattering solutions for this system it is again\nconvenient to proceed in the adiabatic picture. The adiabatic amplitudes obey equations (21) except that the\ngauge potentials are now given by Eq. (28).

The proposed spin 1/2 system does not have an electromagnetic\ncharge and so this effective magnetic field is a manifestation of what is, sometimes, called artificial or synthetic magnetism[9\u201313, 34].

It expresses the scattering solutions in terms\nof the integral\nZ\nF\u2261\nds * j\n(94)\nC\n\n(89)\n\n\u2212w\n\nwhich is invariant with respect to the gauge or representation. That is, F has the same value in both the diabatic\nor adiabatic pictures. If the collision energy is such that\nthe excited adiabatic channel is closed, then F does not\nvanish and its value is given by the second line in Eq.\n(93). Furthermore, in the adiabatic representation that\nvalue is determined from the contribution of the current\nthat is proportional to A. Because this result is obtained\nin the, exact, coupled-channel framework it does not require the invocation of the BO approximation. However,\nthe BO approximation provides an elegant and accurate\ndescription and the appearance of a vector gauge potential in Eq. (40) is simply a consequence of the fact that\nthe BO approximation is faithful to the requirement that\nF does not have a null value. Indeed, the arbitrary removal of the vector potential in the BO approximation\ncompromises its efficacy.\nIt is important to note that the vector potential Eq.\n(40) and the resulting effective B field are source-less\nand there are no-singularities associated with it. Consider now the case where the BO approximation is no\nlonger valid at higher collision energies where the excited\nadiabatic state is also open. In the high energy limit\nwhere E >> \u2206 we can ignore \u2206 (in lowest order) and it\nis evident that in this limit\n|t12 | \u2192 |r12 | \u2192 0\n\n(95)\n\nand F \u2192 0. Thus, at higher collision energies the scattering properties are not affected by the presence of the\nvector gauge potential, i.e. its influence on the system is\nwhat one would expect from that of a pure gauge. This\ndoes not preclude the fact that when working in the adiabatic picture one cannot ignore the gauge potentials when\nsolving for the multi-channel amplitudes. An interesting\n\n\f12\ncase concerns the energy regime where both channels are\nopen, thus voiding the BO approximation, but the limit\nbehavior, given in Eq. (95), has not been reached. That\ndiscussion will be deferred to future investigations by the\nauthor.\nIn summary we have shown the necessity of including\nthe non-trivial vector potential Eq. (40) in the BO approximation. The potential predicts a Lorentz force that\ndetermines the scattering properties of the proposed system. We illustrated how this system is an analog to that\nof a charged particle that is scattered by a ferromagnetic\nslab. We have solved the, exact, fully coupled equations\nin both the diabatic and adiabatic pictures and showed\nthe fidelity of the BO approximation at low collision energies. At higher collision energies we find, in an appropriate limit, that the presence of the induced gauge\npotentials do not affect scattering properties. Thus the\nemergence of non-trivial gauge structure in the low energy limit is suggestive of phenomena that arise when a\nsymmetry is broken[35].\n\nis illustrated by the blue contours in Figure (5a). The\ninitial kinetic energy of the packet was chosen so penetration of the potential barrier, illustrated in Figure (2),\nis prevented. However, the packet can execute a transition into the open channel across the barrier. In other\nwords, a transition from the g to f channel occurs in the\nregion \u03be \u2248 0. This is illustrated in Figure (5a) by the\nred contours that represent the wave-packet, probability,\ncontours in the f channel. In addition to distortion and\nspreading of the packet there is a noticeable swerve in its\nvelocity as it emerges from the interaction region.

In the adiabatic picture the open channel amplitude\ng\u0303 evolves in a constant adiabatic potential \u2212\u2206 shown in\nFigure (2b).

The magnetic induction is normal to the plane\nof the page, and is illustrated by the green shaded area\nin Figure (5b). In Figure (5a) we also plot, shown by the\ndashed line, the trajectory for the solution of the classical equations of motion, subjected to a Lorentz force\nv \u00d7 B, where |B| is given by Eq. (38). Comparison\nof the classical path and that traced by the centers of\nthe wave-packets shows good agreement. The deflection\nangle suffered by a charged particle that is normally incident on a ferromagnetic slab, of finite width, with constant magnetic induction B directed perpendicular to the\nplane of the page is given by Eq. (46).\nIn Table I we tabulate values of the deflection angles \u03b8,\nobtained by calculating the expectation values < \u03be(t) >,\n< \u03b7(t) > for various values of incident, adiabatic, packet\n\n\f13\n\nFIG. 5.

In that table we show the dependence of \u03b8 on the choice of the energy gap parameter\n\u2206. At lower collision energies, so that k 2 << 2\u2206, we\nfind that Eq. (46) provides a good approximation for \u03b8.\nAs the energy gap 2\u2206 is decreased, for a fixed value of\nk, Eq. (46) is less accurate. However, even at threshold\nk 2 \u2248 2\u2206 there is still fairly good agreement between the\ncalculated value and that predicted by solutions of Eq.\n(100). When k 2 > 2\u2206 the excited adiabatic state is open\nand transitions from the adiabatic channel labeled g\u0303 into\nf \u0303 is energetically allowed. In Figure (6a) we illustrate the\nevolution of the amplitudes |g(t)|2 and |f (t)|2 for the collision energy where 2\u2206/k 2 = 1/3. The incident packet,\nin the g channel, bifurcates when it reaches the interaction region. Because there is sufficient kinetic energy, the\nremainder of the initial packet proceeds along the path\n\u03b7 = 0 in the region \u03be > 0. However, a fraction of that\npacket makes a transition into the f channel, and our calculations show that the angle of the swerve illustrated in\nthat figure is in harmony with that obtained at the lower\ncollision energies tabulated in Table I. Therefore there is\na state-dependent spatial segregation of the initial beam,\n\na hallmark of quantum control. In panel (b) of that figure we plot these probabilities for energies 2\u2206/k 2 = 1/6\nand now find a small, barely noticeable, remnant of the\npacket in the f channel. In the limit k \u2192 \u221e (or \u2206 \u2192 0)\nEq. (96) allow analytic solutions and g(t) simply evolves\nas that of a free particle. According to definition Eq. (98\n) the initial, adiabatic gauge, packet g\u0303(t) makes a transition into the f \u0303 channel in the region \u03be > 0. This \"transition\" is induced by the off-diagonal gauge couplings in\nEq. (99). The \"transition\" is simply an artifact of the\nadiabatic gauge (i.e. different definitions for the scattering basis in the two asymptotic regions, \u03be < 0, \u03be > 0).\nBecause of relation (6) we conclude that A is encoded in\nthe definition of Had and since [HBO , A] 6= 0 gauge symmetry is explicitly broken by HBO . Though A is trivial,\nin the sense of it being a pure gauge, quantum evolution\nselects and is sensitive to the projected \u00c3 = P AP nontrivial connection. In the adiabatic picture the gauge\npotentials are explicit, being minimally coupled to the\namplitudes. As k \u2192 \u221e, or \u2206 \u2192 0, their presence simply contributes to a multichannel, or non-Abelian, phase\nin the adiabatic amplitudes that has no physical import.\nIn contrast, at lower energies the system behaves as if\nit has acquired a non-integrable phase factor. The effect\nis most pronounced when the excited adiabatic state is\n\n\f14\nclosed.\nThe time-dependent approach can be exploited for\nmore complex scattering scenarios, for consider the following form of the parameter\n\u03a6(\u03b7) = p\n\n\u03b7k\n\u03b72\n\n+ 4\u03b3f 2\n\n(101)\n\nwhere \u03b3 is, in general, a complicated function of \u03b2, k, \u2206.\nHere we set it to have the constant value \u03b3 = 1. Using Eq.\n(101) we propagate wave packets for various values of impact parameter. In Figure (7 a) we plot trajectories of the\ntotal expectation values < \u03c8(t)|\u03be|\u03c8(t) >, < \u03c8(t)|\u03b7|\u03c8(t) >\nfor the various impact parameters b. At each impact parameter we choose identical wave-packet widths and set\nk = 12, \u2206 = 400. The trajectories shown in that figure, by the solid red lines, demonstrate that the paths\nconverge to a common focal point given by f = 3. This\nresult is gauge invariant, i.e. it can be obtained using amplitudes obtained in either diabatic or adiabatic gauges.\nHowever, the adiabatic picture provides a transparent\nphysical description. For, in it, the system is accurately\ndescribed by Eq. (100). That description includes the\nemergence of an effective magnetic induction B = \u2207 \u00d7 \u00c3\nwhose magnitude is\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u03c0\u03b2k\u03b7 8f 2 + \u03b7 2 sech2 (\u03b2\u03be) cos 12 \u03c0 tanh(\u03b2\u03be)\n(102)\n3/2\n4 (4f 2 + \u03b7 2 )\nand is normal to the plane of the page. In Figure (7b)\nwe illustrate the propagation of a coherent wave packet\nslab of finite width along the \u03b7 direction. After its passage through the \"magnetic\" lens at \u03be \u2248 0, its shape is\nsignificantly distorted. At \u03c41 = 0.3, where the packet\ndescribes free particle evolution, it assumes the shape of\na \"shark-fin\" as shown in that figure. The width, along\nthe \u03b7 direction, is significantly reduced from its value\nat \u03c40 . A dramatic consequence of the proposed \"magnetic\" lensing effect. Such a lens, if realized, could find\napplication as an \"optical\" component in an atom laser.\nIn addition, consider two localized but coherent packets\nspatially separated at t = 0. After passing through the\nlens they meet and interfere. Because of different geometric phase histories the interference pattern depends\non the \"magnetic\" flux enclosed by the paths. One can\ntherefore anticipate its application as a novel expression\nof atom interferometry.\n\nF.\n\nAharonov-Bohm gauge potentials\n\nThe systems in the previous sections provides illustrations of how effective gauge forces manifest in simple\nquantum systems, and serves as a template for more intricate systems. In the examples discussed above, we\ntook for the internal Hamiltonian Eq. (5) where U is\ngiven by Eq. (27). Such a Hamiltonian may be engineered by \"dressing\" a 2-level atom with a laser[13, 15].\nAlternatively, one can dress a spin-1/2 system that has a\n\nFIG. 7.

Below we describe\na 2D version of such systems. A similar, field-theoretic,\nanalog for such a system was also proposed in Ref.[43].\nConsider that U given by Eq. (27) is now replaced by\n\u03c0\n\u03c6\n\u03c6\nU = exp(\u2212i \u03c33 ) exp(i \u03c31 ) exp(i \u03c33 )\n2\n4\n2\n\n(103)\n\nwhere \u03c6 the azimuthal angle in the x y plane. Hamiltonian Eq. (4) is now given by\n~2 2\n\u2207 + Had\n2m R\n= U (\u03c6)HBO (\u03c1)U \u2020 (\u03c6).\n\nH=\u2212\nHad\n\n(104)\n\nThis adiabatic Hamiltonian is identical to that of a spin\n1/2 particle, with a magnetic moment \u03bc0 , interacting\nwith an external magnetic field in the xy plane as shown\nin Figure (8), i.e.\nHad = \u03bc0 \u03c3 * B\nB = \u03c6\u0302 B(\u03c1).\n\n(105)\n\nThe strength of field B(\u03c1), where \u03c1 is the distance from\nthe origin, depends on the physical setup. For example, a\nwire current passing through the origin (out of the page)\ngenerates such a field with B(\u03c1) \u223c 1/\u03c1. For the purpose of this discussion we envision a setup in which B(\u03c1)\nhas the constant value \u2206, and then the BO energies are\nsimply given by \u00b1\u2206, i.e.\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u2206 0\nHBO =\n0 \u2212\u2206\nand where we have set \u03bc0 = 1.\nIn the adiabatic picture we again obtain Eq. (21) but\nwith the vector potential now given by\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u03c6\u0302\n\u22121 i e\u2212i\u03c6\nA=\n,\n(106)\n1\n2\u03c1 \u2212i ei\u03c6\n\n\f15\nwhere \u03c6 is the polar angle in a cylinder coordinate system. The diagonal scalar potential V = HBO contains\nthe BO eigenvalues as its entries. Eq. (106) contains diagonal as well as the off-diagonal components that couple\nthe two adiabatic channels. Suppose the channel with BO\neigenvalue +B(\u03c1) = \u2206 is closed, i.e. the collision energy\nk 2 < 2m\n~2 \u2206 as \u03c1 \u2192 \u221e.\n\nwhere the line integral is taken along the path C that\nencloses the origin. Because of Eq. (109) we cannot find\na gauge transformation in which the vector potential is\neliminated[28]. Indeed this vector potential is familiar\nfrom Aharonov-Bohm scattering[38]. A similar vector\npotential has been invoked[16] for poly-atomic systems\nin which conical intersections occur. It is note-worthy to\nmention that the adiabatic eigenstates U (\u03b8)|\u00b1 > (where\n|\u00b1 > are the eigenstates of HB0 ) are not multi-valued,\nand the BO eigenvalues \u00b1B(\u03c1) are non-degenerate everywhere, so the analysis given in Ref. [16, 39] does\nnot apply here. Previous studies of geometric phase effects in reactive scattering require the presence of conical intersections, as in studies of the hydrogen-exchange\nreaction[40]. Unlike the example given in the previous\nsections, gauge potential (108) does posess singular behavior as \u03c1 \u2192 0, as is evidenced by relation (109) which\ndoes not vanish in the limit as C encloses and contracts\nupon the origin. Consider the following integral\nZ\nW = P exp(i dR * A)\n(110)\nC\n\nFIG. 8. (Color online) Illustration for the system described\nby Eq. (104). Dotted line represents a classical trajectory\nof the neutral atom for a given impact parameter. Green\nconcentric circles represent the external magnetic field lines.\nBlue arrows represent the spin orientation of the lowest energy\nZeeman level for the atom. The upper Zeeman level is closed,\nand so the spin of the atom is slaved to its lowest Zeeman\nlevel.\n\nwhere C is a path that starts at the point {\u03c1 = R0 , \u03c6 = 0}\nand follows a circular arc to the final point {R0 , \u03c6}. A is\ngiven by Eq. (106) and in order to evaluate this integral\nwe parametrize the path R(t) = R0 cos \u03c9t \u00ee + R0 sin \u03c9t \u0135.\nAccording to Eq.

Now,\n\nWe then ignore the gauge coupling to the closed channel and project onto the open sector to obtain the approximate, one-channel, equation\n\u2212\n\n~2\n(\u2207 \u2212 iA)2 F (R) + V (R)F (R) = EF (R),\n2m\n(107)\n\nwhere\nA=\n\n\u03c6\u0302\n2\u03c1\n\nV (R) = \u2212\u2206 +\n\n~2\n,\n8m\u03c12\n\n(108)\n\nand the second term in Eq. (108) represents the induced\nscalar gauge potential[7]. This procedure is analogous\nto the one we carried out in the previous section for the\n2D \"magnetic\" slab. There we showed that the BO projection is accurate in cases where the excited channel\nis closed, this conclusion also applies to this system[37].\nVector potential (108) has the property\nZ\ndr * A 6= 0\n(109)\nC\n\ndW\n= iA(t)W\ndt\n\n(112)\n\nwhich integrated, gives\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\n1\n\u2212i exp(\u2212i\u03c9t)\nW (t) = \u221a\n.

When path C makes a closed circuit\nwe find W (2\u03c0/\u03c9) = 1 as it must. Therefore A is a pure\ngauge and is not singular. However its diagonal, Abelian,\n\u03c6\u0302\ncomponents \u00b1 2\u03c1\nneed not be and, in this case, lead to\nthe singular behavior evidenced by relation (109). At low\ncollision energies, quantum dynamics effectively projects\nout the channel in which this manifestation of a nonintegrable phase factor emerges.\nThough vector potential Eq. (108) is nontrivial it does\nnot lead to an effective Lorentz force for \u03c1 6= 0, nevertheless its presence has a profound effect on the scattering\nproperties of this system[37]. These examples illustrate\nhow gauge potentials arise due to the \"dressing\" of the\natom (a spin 1/2 system) by external fields. Below we\n\n\f16\nshow how this relates to a central question of geometric\nmagnetism, how and why do non-trivial gauge potentials\narise in inter-atomic interactions? We now take our system to be that of two spin - 1/2 systems that interact via\na spin-spin dipolar interaction. Such systems are often\nrealized in nature, including that for the interaction of\ntwo hydrogen atoms [21, 37]. They also serve as a template for a non-trivial two-qubit quantum gate[21]. Here\nthe adiabatic energy splittings are generated by the internal spin-spin interaction, and the BO energy matrix\nis sandwiched by rotation operators similar to that given\nabove. In an adiabatic expansion (now a four channel,\nor two-qubit problem) the PSS equations possess a four\nchannel vector potential, similar to those given above and\ndiscussed in detail below.\n\nIV.\n\nINTERNAL GAUGE POTENTIALS\n\nConsider Hamiltonian (105) in three spatial dimensions and with B spherically symmetric about the origin. This (or closely related to it) system has been discussed extensively in the literature[17, 24, 41]. In Berry's\nmodel [17], R is treated as a classical variable, Stone\nquantized R and considered the full quantal solutions.\nBerry and Robbins[24] also studied, from a semi-classical\nperspective, the role of the effective Lorentz forces[5, 6]\nthat arise in such systems. The diagonal components of\nA produce the effective magnetic field of a Dirac magnetic monopole[3, 42]. These gauge potentials are realized in molecular and atomic systems[3, 19] and Stone\n[41] suggested a \"Heath-Robinson-type device\", a rotating solenoid interacting with a spin 1/2 particle, to serve\nas a physical realization.\nConsider the Hamiltonian for two, interacting, spin1/2 particles[21] with magnetic moments\nH=\u2212\n\n~2 2\n\u2207 + Had (R)\n2m R\n\n(114)\n\n\uf8eb3\n\nHBO\n\n\u03a3(R) \u2212\n\uf8ec\n0\n=\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n0\n0\n\n\u03b12\n2R3\n\nA=\n\nAt 0\n0 0\n\uf8eb\n\n1 \uf8ec\nAt = \uf8ec\nR\uf8ed\n\nHad = H0 + Hdip\n\u0010\n\u0011\n33 \u03a3(R) +1 \u03a3(R)\nH0 = 3 \u03a3(R) \u22121 \u03a3(R) Sa * Sb +\n4\n\u03b12 h\n(Sa * R)(Sb * R) i\nHdip = 3 Sa * Sb \u2212 3\n.\n(115)\nR\nR2\nThe scalar potentials, 3 \u03a3(R), 1 \u03a3(R), are arbitrary and\ndepend on the polarization properties of the constituents.\nFor a structure-less system, e.g. two electrons, these\nscalar terms are degenerate and H0 reduces to the longrange Coulomb interaction. In the case of two neutral\nspin 1/2 atoms, such as two Alkali atoms, H0 (in atomic\nunits) represents the isotropic electrostatic interaction\nbetween the atoms and 3 \u03a3(R) and 1 \u03a3(R) are the triplet\nand singlet BO energies of the electrostatic Hamiltonian\nrespectively.

There is no direct coupling between the\ntwo M = \u00b11 channels, and the diagonal components are that of Dirac-magnetic monopoles of integer charges \u00b11.\n\u2022 Because the energies of the diagonal entries in\nHBO are split, a gauge transformation cannot be\nfound in which the temporal components of the\nfield strength tensor vanish[5]. As a consequence\nthe gauge potentials are non-trivial in the sense described for the systems discussed in the previous\nsections.\nWhen solving the scattering equations in the adiabatic\ngauge the induced gauge potentials, depending on the\ncollision energy, contribute to spin changing cross sections. Though exact scattering calculations for such a\nsystem (i.e. two ground state hydrogen atoms) have\nbeen performed in the diabatic gauge[45] the question\nof how and in what manner the induced gauge potentials influence scattering cross sections remains to be\ninvestigated[21].\nV.\n\nSUMMARY AND DISCUSSION\n\nIn molecular physics and atomic collision theory one\nis typically faced with a many-body Hamiltonian having\nthe structure given by Eq. (4). The adiabatic Hamiltonian Had (R, r) is a function of the \"fast degrees\" of freedom r as well as R, the coordinates for the positions of\nthe atoms. Using the eigenstates of Had as a basis one arrives at the set of Equations (3) in which the matrix vector gauge potential A manifests. In applications, Eq. (3)\ninvolves an infinite set of coupled equations and a truncation procedure must be invoked in order to proceed with\na working theory. The remaining gauge potentials, after\ntruncation, are non-trivial in the sense that the resulting\nspatial field strength tensor does not vanish[5] and, as a\nconsequence, lead to effective gauge forces. They emerge\nin addition to the traditional Hellmann-Feynman force.\nWe introduced and studied the gauge structure of several\nlow-dimensional scattering systems that are solvable and\nwhere it was not necessary to employ the truncation, or\nBO, approximation. For the adiabatic Hamiltonian we\nreplaced the fast degrees of freedom with the discrete\nPauli coordinates \u03c3,\nHad (R, r) \u2192 Had (R, \u03c3)\n\nso that a complete set of basis functions can be used\nto obtain the exact solutions of the PSS equations (3).\nThough our choices for the adiabatic Hamiltonians varied\nin complexity they shared the feature that\nHad = U (R)HBO U \u2020 (R)\n\n(120)\n\nwhere U is a unitary operator which can be characterized\nby it's gauge field as given in Eq. (6). HBO is a diagonal\nmatrix that contains the energy eigenvalues for Had , and\nin our discussion we were careful to choose systems in\nwhich HBO did not feature degeneracies at physical values for the slow parameter R. The energy gap in HBO\nexplictly \"breaks\" the symmetry inherent in the definition of U . The matrix structure of Had depends on the\nparticular system. For example, in our discussion relating\nto Figure (1) Had can be \"engineered\"[13] by the application of a laser field on a two-level system, for the system\ndescribed in Figure (8) Had is generated by an external\nmagnetic field coupled to a neutral spin-1/2 particle. In\nEq. (117) U is a rotation operator that characterizes the\ndipolar interaction Eq. (115) for two spin-1/2 particles.\nFor the system described by Eq. (28) we were able to\nsolve for the scattering parameters in both the adiabatic\nand diabatic descriptions and showed that the quantity,\nZ\nF\u2261\nds * j\n(121)\nC\n\nwhere j is a current, is invariant with respect to the\nchoice in representation. Furthermore, for the closed loop\nC shown in Figure (4) we found that F does not vanish\nin the low-energy limit. In the adiabatic representation\nthe non-vanishing contribution arises from the gauge potential A that define U . In the low-energy limit, where\nthe excited adiabatic channel is closed, we found that the\nBO projection procedure serves as a good approximation\nfor solutions obtained by the fully coupled calculation.\nThe effective single-channel gauge potential predicts a\n\"magnetic\" field, given by Eq. (38), that leads to the\nappearance of an effective Lorentz force on the scattered\natom. The BO amplitude which is coupled to the, nontrivial, gauge potential allows the BO current to satisfy\nthe condition F 6= 0. We compared the quantal scattering solutions of this system with that of a charged particle interacting with a ferromagnetic slab, and we found\nthat the former predicts, according to Eq. (46), a deflection angle in harmony with that predicted by the latter.\nThough the multichannel gauge potential A is trivial in\nthe sense that the spatial components of the curvature\nvanish, in accordance with Eq. (8), non-trivial gauge behavior manifests in the low energy limit. The adiabatic\nHamiltonian does not suffer from any degeneracies, and\nwe propose that the non-trivial gauge behavior is akin to\nthe phenomenon of symmetry breaking[35]. This system\nserves as a valuable template for more complex examples,\nbut it also highlights possible applications for geometric\nmagnetism. For example, in section III.E we showed how\nthese ideas can be applied toward the engineering of an\neffective \"magnetic\" lens for neutral atoms.\n\n\f18\nWe showed the relationship between systems in which\ndressing is carried out by external agents, such as a magnetic field for the system described by Eq. (104), or\na laser field[13] for the two level system given by Eq.\n(27), with those in which it is accomplished by mutual\ninter-particle interactions. For the interacting two-qubit\nsystem give by Eqs. (116) and (117) \"dressing\" is accomplished by the 2-body tensor interaction Eq. (115).\nWe argue that, regardless of the nature of the dressing\nagent, gauge behavior manifest in these disparate systems via the same mechanism, and we do not advocate\nthe use different labels, e.g. fictitious, artificial, synthetic\nor geometric magnetism, to identify the phenomena. We\npropose that geometric magnetism is an appropriate terminology that underscores its universality.\n\nIn the region x < 0 we obtain\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u221a\nSco exp( 4m\u2206 x)\nF =\n(A5)\nexp(ik(x \u2212 L)) + R exp(\u2212ik(x \u2212 L))\nand solve for the open channel reflection coefficient R by\nrequiring the solution at x > 0 to match the boundary\ncondition at x = L, and then matching it with the asymptotic solutions at x = 0. However, care must be taken\nwhen matching the derivatives of the adiabatic amplitudes since the vector potential A is discontinuous across\nthe boundary. We require the diabatic amplitudes given\nin Eq. (18) and their derivatives to be continuous across\nthe boundary. However since the adiabatic amplitudes\nare related to them according to Eq. (20) we require\nthat\nF 0ad> \u2212 F 0ad< = i A F ad (0)\n\nAppendix A: Coupled channel solution\n\nF 0ad> ,\n\nWe compare the solution of the approximate adiabatic\nsolution Eq.

Though the eigensolutions are\nnon-trivial (see Supplementary material) in the region\nx > 0, carrying out the procedure that resulted in Eq.\n(A7) leads to R = \u22121 as it must.\nAppendix B: Scattering by a 2D ferromagnetic strip\n\nAnalytic expressions for the eigenvalues can be gleaned\nusing the formula of Ferraria[46] for the roots of the quartic equation.
