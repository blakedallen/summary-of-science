Introduction\nDuring the last decade, substantial knowledge about the 60-GHz millimeter-wave (MMW) channel has been\naccumulated and different architectures have been analyzed to develop MMW communication systems for\ncommercial applications [1-2]. The 60 GHz bandwidth is suitable for high data-rate and short-distance wireless\ncommunications. This interest is particularly due to the large bandwidth and the important power loss caused by the\nfree space and walls attenuation which permits to reuse the same frequency bandwidth even in the next floor of the\nsame building. Concerning the 60 GHz front-end technology, higher frequencies lead to smaller sizes of RF\ncomponents including very small antennas. The cost is mainly related to the transceiver RF front ends.\nThe development of new wireless communication systems requires accurate knowledge of the propagation\nchannel to efficiently simulate and design them, including new modulation schemes, coded and multiple access\ntechniques. The rest of this paper is organized as follows: section 2 presents an overview of several studies realized\nat IETR concerning the measurements and characterization of the 60 GHz radio propagation channel. Section 3\nreports recent work concerning of a 60-GHz radio communication system. Some conclusions are drawn in section 4.\n\n2. Channel measurements and characterization\nDuring the last decade, several research activities were carried out at IETR in the 60 GHz bandwidth: the\nrealization of the channel sounder, the indoor radio channel measurements, simulation and characterization.\n\n2.1 Channel sounder\nA 60-GHz wideband channel sounder was developed at IETR (Fig. 1). This channel sounder has 500 MHz\nbandwidth, 40 dB relative dynamic and 2.3 ns effective time resolution, which means that two paths separated from\nby 70 cm can be correctly discriminated. Based on the sliding correlation technique, this sounder is optimized to\n\n\fperform long term measurement campaigns. Some measurement results with Doppler analysis up to 20 kHz are\npresented in [3].\n\nFig. 1 Channel sounder at 60 GHz realized by IETR\n\n2.2 Channel measurements and characterization\n\nAttenuation (dB)\n\nIn [4-6], the results of several studies concerning the radio propagation at 60 GHz in residential environments\nwere published. These studies are based on several measurement campaigns realized with the IETR channel\nsounder. The measurements have been performed in residential furnished environments. The study of the angles-ofarrival (AOA) shows the importance of openings (such as doors, staircase, etc.) for the radio propagation between\nadjacent rooms (Fig. 2). From the database of impulse responses, several propagation characteristics are computed:\nattenuation, delay spread, delay window, coherence bandwidth [5]. The wave propagation depends on antennas\n(beam-width, gain and polarization), physical environment (furniture, materials) and human activity. A particular\nattention is paid to the influence of the human activity on radio propagation. In [6], it is shown that people\nmovements can make the propagation channel unavailable during about one second (Fig. 3).\n\n\u2500 Measurement\n--- 5 dB threshold\n\u2500 Attenuation (channel static)\n+ Shadowing beginning\n0 Shadowing cluster beginning\n\nTime (min)\n\nFig. 2 Received power in the horizontal plane\n(NLOS, with a receiving horn antenna)\n\nFig. 3 Human activity measurement at 60 GHz\n(Receiver antenna: horn, channel activity: 4 persons)\n\nHowever, the angular diversity can be used: when a path is shadowed, another one, coming from another\ndirection, can maintain the radio link. From the characterization of the indoor radio propagation, several\nrecommendations concerning the deployment of the very high data rate 60 GHz wireless networks are derived in [5].\n\n\f2.3 Deterministic simulation of the 60 GHz radio channel\nTwo deterministic simulation tools have been used to complement the experimental characterization: a\nray-tracing tool [6] and a 3 D Gaussian Beam Tracking (GBT) technique [7]. Both tools provided comparable\ncoverage simulations in a residential indoor environment (a house) at 60 GHz and 500 MHz bandwidth. In Fig. 4,\nsimulated coverage results based on GBT algorithm are shown. This method based on Gabor frame approach is\nparticularly well suited to high frequencies and permits a collective treatment of rays which offers significant\ncomputation time efficiency. The advanced deterministic prediction tool X-Siradif based on ray-tracing has further\nshown a good agreement with the power-delay measurement results (see Fig. 5), which is important for such a wide\nbandwidth. Besides the ray-tracing technique can easily and accurately take into account any measured antenna\npatterns. In [6], other comparison results concerning the channel impulse response and the angles-of-arrival are\ngiven. Besides, the ray-tracing technique can easily and accurately take into account any measured antenna patterns.\n\nHowever at 60 GHz static simulations are not sufficient to help for the design of communication systems.\nSIRADEL is still pursuing its investigation on indoor propagation by setting up dynamic scenarios to simulate the\npresence of people in the room (mobility models, direct path and obstruction).\n\n3. Design of a 60 GHz wireless communication system\nStudies for different types of single carrier (SC) modulation and orthogonal frequency division multiplexing\n(OFDM) were proposed in the IEEE 802.15.3 Task Group 3c for the future wireless communication systems\noperating at 60 GHz. The choice of modulation schemes for 60 GHz radio is highly dependent on the characteristics\nof the propagation channel, the use of high gain antenna/antenna array and the limitations imposed by the RF\ntechnology. Some SC modulations as BPSK and QPSK are considered. The SC has two main advantages over\nOFDM: lower complexity and lower PAPR (peak-to average power ratio).\nIETR, one of the partners of the Techim@ges project, is currently involved in the design and the realization\nof a low-cost, high data rate (about 1 Gbps) and small-distance (d < 10 m) wireless communication system. Fig. 6\nshows the single carrier system architecture proposed by IETR which uses a BPSK modulation. The 3.5 GHz and\n58.5 GHz phase locked oscillators use a 70 MHz frequency synthesizer. At the receiver, the intermediate frequency\nand the clock are obtained from the received signal. The frequency-domain equalizer (FDE) and some error\ncorrecting codes are under study. In order to improve the link budget, especially for point-to-point applications, it is\npreferable to use high-gain directive antennas.\n\n\fData\ninput\nCAG\n\nLNA\n\nAmp\n60 GHz\nPLO\n3.5\nGHz\n\nPLO\n56.5\nGHz\nRef.\n70 MHz\n\nRef.\n70 MHz\nData\noutput\n\nFI\n3. 5 GHz\n\nPLO\n56.5\nGHz\n\nSampler\n\nClock\nrecovery\n\nFig. 6 Single-carrier wireless communication system at 60 GHz\n\n4. Conclusion\nIn this paper, a brief overview of several studies performed at IETR on 60 GHz indoor wireless\ncommunications is presented. The characterization of the radio propagation channel is based on several\nmeasurement campaigns realized with the channel sounder of IETR. Some typical residential environments were\nalso simulated by ray tracing and Gaussian Beam Tracking. The obtained results show a good agreement with the\nexperimental results. Currently, the IETR is developing a SC wireless communication system operating at 60 GHz.\n\n5.
