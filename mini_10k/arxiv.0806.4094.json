We give a definition of the spectral flow for paths of bounded essentially hyperbolic operators on a Banach space. The spectral flow induces\na group homomorphism on the fundamental group of every connected component of the space of essentially hyperbolic operators. We prove that this\nhomomorphism completes the exact homotopy sequence of a Serre fibration.\nThis allows us to characterise its kernel and image and to produce examples\nof spaces where it is not injective or not surjective, unlike what happens for\nHilbert spaces. For a large class of paths, namely the essentially splitting,\nthe spectral flow of A coincides with \u2212 ind(FA ), the Fredholm index of the\ndifferential operator FA (u) = u\u2032 \u2212 Au.\n\nIntroduction\nThe spectral flow first appeared in [7] for a family of elliptic and self-adjoint\noperators At , ascribed to the joint work of M. Atiyah and G. Lusztig. We outline\ntheir effective description as \"net number of eigenvalues that change sign (from \u2212\nto +) while the parameter family is completing a period\" in the definition given by\nJ. Robbin and D. Salamon in [24, Theorem 4.21]: In a neighbourhood [t\u2212 , t+ ] of the\nreal line of a point t \u2208 R (called a crossing) such that 0 \u2208 \u03c3(At ) (the spectrum of\n1991 Mathematics Subject Classification. 46B20,58B05,58E05,58J30.\nKey words and phrases. Spectral flow, projectors, hyperplanes.\nThis work was supported by the Priority Research Centers Program through the National Research\nFoundation of Korea (NRF) funded by the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology (Grant\n2009-0094068) and the Scuola Normale Superiore of Pisa.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nGARRISI, D.\n\nAt ), \u03c3(As ) can be described as a finite family of continuously differentiable curves\n\u03bbi : [t\u2212 , t+ ] \u2192 R such that \u03bb\u2032i (t) 6= 0. The contribution to the spectral flow of a\ncrossing is given by\nX\nsign(\u03bbi (t+ )) \u2212 sign(\u03bbi (t\u2212 ))\n\u03bbi\n\nand the spectral flow is the sum of these contributions over all the crossings. The\nspectral flow was used to define a Morse index for 1-periodic hamiltonian orbits, as\nin [27, pp. 23], and then to define the Floer homology. The definition by J. Robbin\nand D. Salamon in [24] requires some differentiability hypotheses and transversality\nconditions. P. Rabier extended their work to unbounded families of operators in\nBanach spaces in [23]. In [21], J. Phillips simplified their definition as follows:\nAt \u2208 F sa (H) is assumed to be a continuous path of Fredholm, bounded and selfadjoint operators, on [0, 1]. If U is a neighbourhood of the origin and J = [t\u2212 , t+ ]\nis a closed interval such that\n1) \u03c3(As ) \u2229 \u2202U = \u2205 for every s \u2208 J;\n2) \u03c3(As ) \u2229 U is a finite set of eigenvalues,\nthen the contribution to the spectral flow from the interval J is defined as\ndim(P (A(t+ ); U )) \u2212 dim(P (A(t\u2212 ); U ))\nwhere P (A; U ) is the spectral projector of A relative to U . The spectral flow is\nthe sum of all the contributions obtained over a partition of the unit interval, Ji ,\nsuch that a neighbourhood Ui as in 1,2) corresponds to each Ji . It is invariant for\nfixed-endpoint homotopies and defines a groups homomorphism on the fundamental\ngroup of each connected component of F sa (H). If H is infinite-dimensional and\nseparable, then there are exactly three connected components, corresponding to I\nand \u2212I (these are contractible to a point) and to 2P \u2212 I, where P is a projector\nwith infinite-dimensional kernel and image. On the fundamental group of the third\none, denoted by F\u2217sa , the spectral flow\nsf : \u03c01 (F\u2217sa ) \u2192 Z\nis a group isomorphism. In [8], J. Phillips later extended this definition to continuous families of unbounded, Fredholm and self-adjoint operators. In contrast with\n[24], no assumptions of differentiability or transversality are made. C. Zhu and\nY. Long in [29] extended the definition in [21] to bounded, admissible operators\n(which are compact perturbations of hyperbolic operators) on Banach spaces: On\nevery interval Ji = [ti\u2212 , ti+ ] of a suitable partition of [0, 1], they provide a path of\nprojectors Qi such that\nQi : Ji \u2192 P(L(E)) is continuous,\nQi (t) \u2212 P + (A(t)) is compact for t \u2208 Ji ,\nQi (t) is a spectral projector of A(t).\nThe contribuition of Ji to the spectral flow is\n[Qi (ti\u2212 ) \u2212 P + (A(ti\u2212 ))] \u2212 [Qi (ti+ ) \u2212 P + (A(ti+ ))],\nwhere [Q \u2212 P ] denotes the Fredholm index of P : Range(Q) \u2192 Range(P ). The\nspectral flow is defined as the sum of the quantity above as Ji varies over the\npartition of [0, 1]. We denote the spectral projector relative to the positive complex\n\n\fSPECTRAL FLOW IN BANACH SPACES\n\n3\n\nhalf-plane by P + (A), and P(L(E)) is the set of projectors of E. This work has\nthree essential purposes:\nI) Further simplifying the definition of spectral flow. Given a path At \u2208 eH(E)\non [0, 1] of essentially hyperbolic operators (which are compact perturbations of\nhyperbolic operators and correspond to the admissible ones used in [29]), there\nexists a continuous path P of projectors on [0, 1] such that\nP (t) \u2212 P + (A(t)) is compact\nfor every t \u2208 [0, 1]. Thus, we define\nsf(A) = [P (0) \u2212 P + (A(0))] \u2212 [P (1) \u2212 P + (A(1))].\nTherefore, we do not need to partition the unit interval (as in the definition in [29]),\nas long as we do not require P (t) to be a spectral projector of A(t).\nThe existence of such a path P follows from the homotopy lifting property of\nthe Serre fibration\np : P(L(E)) \u2192 P(C(E)).\nWe use C(E) to denote the quotient of the operator algebra L(E) by the ideal of the\ncompact operators. P(C(E)) is the space of projectors of the Calkin algebra and\np is the quotient projection. The definition we give of spectral flow coincides with\nthe one in [29]. In \u00a73, we show that the spectral flow is invariant for fixed-endpoint\nhomotopies and that, given two continuous paths A and B such that A(1) = B(0),\nthere holds sf(A \u2217 B) = sf(A) + sf(B). These and other basic facts are outlined in\nProposition 3.3.\nII) Studying the homomorphism properties of the spectral flow. We prove that\neH(E) is homotopically equivalent to P(C(E)) and that the spectral flow completes\nthe exact homotopy sequence of the fibration above. This allows us to characterise\nthe kernel and the image of the spectral flow sf P defined on the fundamental group\nof the connected component of 2P \u2212 I \u2208 eH(E). Precisely: an integer m belongs\nto the image of sf P if and only if\nh1) there exists a projector Q connected to P by a path in the space of projectors P(L(E)), such that Q \u2212 P is compact and [P \u2212 Q] = m;\n\u223c\nker(sf P ) = im(p\u2217 ). Hence, sf P is injective if and only if\nh2) im(p\u2217 ) = {0}.\nThe existence of a projector satisfying h1,2) depends heavily on the structure of\nthe Banach space E. When E is Hilbert, J. Phillips proved in [21] that for every\nprojector with infinite-dimensional range and kernel, h1), with m = 1, and h2)\nhold. We show that lp and l\u221e have this property as well. In general, at least one\nprojector (and then infinitely many) exists in the spaces satisfying the hypotheses\nof Proposition 4.6 and Proposition 4.7.\nThe question whether property h1) holds for some projector is strongly related\nto the existence of complemented subspaces isomorphic to closed subspaces of codimension m. This relation is highlighted in Proposition 4.6. In fact, given a space\nE, isomorphic to its hyperplanes, the projector over each of the summands of E \u2295E\nfulfills property h1). Thus, sf P is surjective. If E is isomorphic to its subspaces\nof co-dimension two, but not to its hyperplanes, the image of the spectral flow is\n2Z, and so on. Examples of such spaces have been constructed by W. T. Gowers\nand B. Maurey in [15]. If E is not isomorphic to any of its proper subspaces, then\n\n\f4\n\nGARRISI, D.\n\nsf P is zero. Such a space was constructed by W. T. Gowers and B. Maurey in the\ncelebrated paper [14].\nWe prove that in a Douady space (cf. [12]), there are projectors P such that sf P\nis not injective and projectors with infinite-dimensional range and kernel such that\nthe spectral flow is zero.\nIII) Comparing the spectral flow with the Fredholm index of the differential\noperator\n\u0013\n\u0012\nd\n1,p\np\n\u2212 A(t) u.\nFA : W (R) \u2192 L (R), u 7\u2192\ndt\nIn \u00a75, we extend the definition of spectral flow for a path At \u2208 eH(E) on R with\nhyperbolic limits at \u00b1\u221e. We prove in Theorem 5.6 that for a large class of paths,\nwhich are essentially hyperbolic, with hyperbolic limits, and essentially splitting\n(cf. [2]), the equality\nind(FA ) = \u2212sf(A)\nholds. The equality above applies, for instance, in the special case where A is\na continuous, compact perturbation of a path of hyperbolic operators with some\nboundary conditions (check [2, Theorem E]). Our theorem confirms the guess of\nA. Abbondandolo and P. Majer in \u00a77 of [2] that for these paths, the equality above\nholds.\nWe remark that our work deals with bounded operators. The differential operator FA arises naturally from the linearisation of a vector field \u03be \u2208 C 1 (E, E) on a\nsolution v \u2032 (t) = \u03be(v(t)), such that the endpoints are zeroes of \u03be and A(t) = D\u03be(v(t)).\nIf FA is Fredholm and surjective (and the zeroes are hyperbolic), then the set\nW\u03be (p, q) = {v : R \u2192 E : v \u2032 (t) = \u03be(v(t)), v(\u2212\u221e) = p, v(+\u221e) = q}\nis a sub-manifold of dimension ind(FA ). This constitutes a landmark for the study\nof the Morse theory on Banach manifolds, as in [3]. A proof of this can be found\nin [2, \u00a78]. If A fulfils the hypotheses of Theorem 5.6, then sf(A) determines the\ndimension of the manifold.\nThe spectral flow also provides an index for 1-periodic solutions of u\u2032 (t) =\nX(u(t)). If DX(ut ) is essentially hyperbolic, then indexX (u) = sf(DX(ut )). Thus,\nin order to have a good Morse theory for periodic solutions, the question whether\nthere are loops with non-trivial spectral flow becomes relevant.\nAcknowledgements.

Spaces of projectors. Given Banach spaces E and F , we denote by L(E, F )\nthe space of bounded operators from E to F . When E = F we use the notation\nL(E). We denote the subsets of compact operators by Lc (E, F ) and Lc (E). The\ncomposition of operators endows the space L(E) with the structure of a Banach algebra (the identity operator being the unit), and the subspace of compact operators\nis a closed ideal. We denote the quotient algebra by C(E). It inherits the structure\nof a Banach algebra and is called the Calkin algebra. The quotient projection\n(2)\n\np : L(E) \u2192 C(E), A 7\u2192 A + Lc (E)\n\nis an algebra homomorphism.\nDefinition 1.5. Given a Banach algebra A, we define the following subsets\n(i) P(A) = {p \u2208 A : p2 = p}, projectors;\n(ii) Q(A) = {q \u2208 A : q 2 = 1}, square roots of the unit;\n(iii) H(A) = {x \u2208 A : \u03c3(x) \u2229 iR = \u2205}, hyperbolic elements.\nProperties and remarks. P and Q are closed subsets, locally path connected and\nanalytic sub-manifolds. A proof of this can be found in [4, Lemma 1.5]. P and Q\nare diffeomorphic to each other through the diffeomorphism p 7\u2192 2p \u2212 1. By (iii) of\nProposition 1.1, applied with \u03a9 = {z : Re(z) 6= 0}, the subset H(A) \u2282 A is open.\nWe denote by G1 (A) the connected component of G(A) of the unit.\nTheorem 1.6. Given two projectors p, q such that either ||p \u2212 q|| < 1 or both are in\nthe same connected component of P(A), there exists u \u2208 G1 (A) such that up = qu.\nFor the proof and details, we refer to [22, Proposition 4.2] and [13, Proposition 2.2]. The theorem above has two consequences:\n(c1) P(A) is locally path-connected. So is Q(A);\n(c2) when A = L(E), two projectors in the same connected component have\nisomorphic ranges and kernels.\nThe quotient projection p in (2) restricts to the subset of projectors and roots of\nthe unit\nP(p) : P(L(E)) \u2192 P(C(E)), P 7\u2192 P + Lc (E)\nQ(p) : Q(L(E)) \u2192 Q(C(E)), Q 7\u2192 Q + Lc (E).\nDefinition 1.7. A continuous map p : E \u2192 B has the homotopy lifting property\nw.r.t. a topological space X if, given continuous maps\nh : X \u00d7 [0, 1] \u2192 B,\n\nf : X \u00d7 {0} \u2192 E,\n\nthere exists H : X \u00d7 [0, 1] \u2192 E such that H(x, 0) = f (x, 0) and p \u25e6 H = h. If the\nhomotopy lifting property holds w.r.t. [0, 1]n for every n \u2265 0, then p is called a\nSerre fibration.\nProposition 1.8. The maps P(p) and Q(p) are surjective Serre fibrations.\nIn general, every surjective algebra homomorphism induces a Serre fibration. For\na proof, see [10, Theorem 2.4]. The surjectivity of P(p) and Q(p) follows from [4,\nProposition 4.1]. In fact, P(p) and Q(p) are locally trivial fiber bundles, as follows\nfrom [4, Proposition 1.3] or [13, Theorem 4.2].\n\n\fSPECTRAL FLOW IN BANACH SPACES\n\n7\n\n1.3. Fredholm operators and relative dimension. Let T \u2208 L(E, F ) be a\nbounded operator. If the image of T is a closed subspace, we have two Banach\nspaces associated with it, namely ker(T ) and E/Range(T ) = coker(T ).\nDefinition 1.9. An operator as above is said to be semi-Fredholm if either ker(T )\nor coker(T ) is a finite-dimensional space. If both have finite dimension, T is called\nFredholm and the integer\nind(T ) = dim ker(T ) \u2212 dim coker(T )\nis the Fredholm index. Otherwise, the index is defined to be +\u221e or \u2212\u221e as long as\nker(T ) or coker(T ) has infinite dimension.\nwe denote by Fred(E, F ) and Fred(E) the subsets of Fredholm operators in\nL(E, F ) and L(E), respectively; Fredk (E, F ) is the set of Fredholm operators of\nindex k.\nProposition 1.10. Let T \u2208 Fred(E, F ), S \u2208 Fred(F, G) and K \u2208 Lc (E, F ). We\nhave\n(a) Fredk (E, F ) \u2286 L(E, F ) is an open subset;\n(b) T + K \u2208 Fred(E, F ) and ind(T + K) = ind(T );\n(c) S \u25e6 T \u2208 Fred(E, G) and ind(S \u25e6 T ) = ind(S) + ind(T );\n(d) given B \u2208 L(E, F ), there exists \u03b5 > 0 such that the maps dim ker(T + \u03bbB)\nand dim coker(T + \u03bbB) are constant on B(0, \u03b5) \\ {0};\n(e) T \u2208 Fred(E, F ) if and only if there exists U \u2208 L(F, E) such that T and\nU are the essential inverse of each other, that is, T \u25e6 U \u2212 I \u2208 Lc (F ) and\nU \u25e6 T \u2212 I \u2208 Lc (E).\nStatements (a,e) are easy to check. Statements (a,b,d) are all stated and proved\nin [16, Ch. IV.5] in the more general setting of semi-Fredholm and unbounded\noperators.\nDefinition 1.11. A pair of closed subspaces (X, Y ) is semi-Fredholm if and only if\ntheir sum is closed and either X \u2229 Y or E/(X + Y ) has a finite dimension. If both\nhave finite dimension, then the Fredholm index of the pair (X, Y ) is defined as\nind(X, Y ) = dim X \u2229 Y \u2212 codimX + Y.\nOtherwise, the index is +\u221e or \u2212\u221e, when either X \u2229 Y or E/(X + Y ) has infinite\ndimension.\nTwo projectors P, Q are compact perturbations of each other if P \u2212 Q \u2208 Lc (E).\nIn this case, the restriction of Q to Range(P ) is in Fred(Range(P ), Range(Q)). The\nrelative dimension between P and Q is defined as\n[P \u2212 Q] := ind(Q : Range(P ) \u2192 Range(Q)).\nThis definition is meant to generalise the dimension gap between two finite-dimensional\nspaces to Banach spaces. The notation above is used by C. Zhu and Y. Long in [29].\nCorresponding definitions are known in Hilbert spaces, considered by A. Abbondandolo and P. Majer in [1, Definition 1.1] (see also [9, Remark 4.9]). A definition\nof relative dimension for pairs of closed subspaces (X, Y ), not necessarily complemented, can be found in [13, Definition 5.8].\nTheorem 1.12. Given pairs of projectors (P, Q) and (Q, R) with compact difference, we have\n\n\f8\n\nGARRISI, D.\n\n(i) if Range(P ) and Range(Q) have finite dimension, then\n[P \u2212 Q] = dim Range(P ) \u2212 dim Range(Q);\n(ii) [P \u2212 R] = [P \u2212 Q] + [Q \u2212 R];\n(iii) on the subset {(P, Q) \u2208 P(L(E)) \u00d7 P(L(E)) : P \u2212 Q \u2208 Lc (E)}, the map\n[P \u2212 Q] is continuous;\n(iv) [P \u2212 Q] = [(I \u2212 Q) \u2212 (I \u2212 P )];\n(v) (Range(P ), ker(Q)) is a Fredholm pair and ind(Range(P ), ker(Q)) = [Q \u2212\nP ].\nProperty (iii) follows from stability results for the index of semi-Fredholm pairs;\nsee [16, Remark IV.4.31] and [13, Theorem 3.3]. For a proof of (iv) and (v), see [29,\nLemma 2.3] and [13, Proposition 5.13], respectively; (i) follows from the remarks\nafter Definition 5.8 in [13].\n2. Essentially hyperbolic operators\nWe recall that a bounded operator A \u2208 L(E) - or more generally an element of a\nBanach algebra A - is called hyperbolic if its spectrum does not meet the imaginary\naxis. We denote by GL(E) the group of invertible operators on E and by GLI (E)\nthe connected component of the identity operator.\nGiven A \u2208 L(E), the spectrum of A + Lc (E) is called the essential spectrum. It\nis usually denoted by \u03c3e (A). By (e) of Proposition 1.10,\n(3)\n\n\u03c3e (A) = { \u03bb : A \u2212 \u03bb 6\u2208 Fred(E) } .\n\nDefinition 2.1. An operator A is called essentially hyperbolic if A + Lc (E) is a\nhyperbolic element in C(E).\nBy the equality above, an operator A \u2208 L(E) is essentially hyperbolic if and\nonly if its essential spectrum does not meet the imaginary axis. A consequence of\n(3) is:\nLemma 2.2. Let D(A) be the set of all isolated points of \u03c3(A), and let \u2202\u03c3(A) be\nthe set of the boundary points of \u03c3(A). Then \u2202\u03c3(A) \\ D(A) is a subset of \u03c3e (A).\nProof. Let \u03bb \u2208 \u2202\u03c3(A) \\ D(A), and suppose that \u03bb 6\u2208 \u03c3e (A), thus A \u2212 \u03bb \u2208 Fred(E).\nLet \u03b5 > 0 as in (d) of Proposition 1.10, with B = \u2212I. Therefore, for some c, k \u2208 Z\ndim ker(A \u2212 z) = c, dim coker(A \u2212 z) = k, for every z \u2208 B(\u03bb, \u03b5) \\ {\u03bb}.\nBecause \u03bb \u2208 \u2202\u03c3(A), there exists w \u2208 B(\u03bb, \u03b5) \\ {\u03bb} such that A \u2212 w is invertible.\nThus, c = k = 0 and A \u2212 z is invertible for every z \u2208 B(\u03bb, \u03b5) \\ {\u03bb}. Hence \u03bb is\nisolated in \u03c3(A).\n\u0003\nWe need a well-known fact about the topology of the real line:\nProposition 2.3. A closed proper subset of the real line with an empty boundary\nis discrete.\nCorollary 2.4. If A is an essentially hyperbolic operator, the set \u03c3(A)\u2229iR is finite.\nProof. We show that the boundary of \u03c3(A) \u2229 iR is empty. Suppose it is not and\nlet \u03bb \u2208 \u2202(\u03c3(A) \u2229 iR) be an arbitrary point. Hence, \u03bb \u2208 \u2202\u03c3(A). Because \u03c3(A) \u2229 iR\nis closed, \u03bb \u2208 iR. Hence \u03bb 6\u2208 \u03c3e (A), because A is essentially hyperbolic. Thus,\n\u03bb \u2208 \u2202\u03c3(A) \\ \u03c3e (A), whence, by Lemma 2.2, \u03bb \u2208 D(A). Hence, \u03bb is isolated in\n\u03c3(A) \u2229 iR in contradiction with the hypothesis that \u03bb is a boundary point. By the\n\n\fSPECTRAL FLOW IN BANACH SPACES\n\n9\n\nproposition above, \u03c3(A) \u2229 iR is discrete. Because it is also compact, it is a finite\nset.\n\u0003\nProposition 2.5. If A is an essentially hyperbolic operator, each of the points of\n\u03c3(A) \u2229 iR is an eigenvalue of finite algebraic multiplicity.\nProof. Let \u03bb \u2208 \u03c3(A)\u2229iR. We infer that A\u2212\u03bb \u2208 Fred0 (E). By (3), A\u2212\u03bb \u2208 Fredk (E)\nfor some k \u2208 Z. Now, by (a) of Proposition 1.10, there exists a neighbourhood V\nof \u03bb such that\nA \u2212 z \u2208 Fredk (E), z \u2208 V.\nBecause \u03bb is isolated, there exists z \u2032 \u2208 V \\ {\u03bb} such that A \u2212 z \u2032 is invertible, hence\nk = 0. Thus, because A \u2212 \u03bb is not invertible, ker(A \u2212 \u03bb) 6= {0}. Hence \u03bb is an\neigenvalue and, by hypothesis, isolated. These two conditions, by Theorem 5.10\nand Theorem 5.28 of [16], imply that the spectral projector P (A; {\u03bb}) has range of\nfinite dimension, which is the algebraic multiplicity.\n\u0003\nTheorem 1.4 provides us with projectors Pi = P (A; {\u03bbi }) for every \u03bbi \u2208 \u03c3(A)\u2229iR.\nLet P = P (A; \u03c3(A) \u2229 { Re(z) 6= 0}). We can write\n!\nn\nn\nX\nX\nPi .\nPi + (A \u2212 I)\n(4)\nA = AP +\ni=1\n\ni=1\n\nAccording to (i,ii) of Theorem 1.4, the term in the brackets is hyperbolic. The\nlast term has finite rank. Thus, we have proved that an essentially hyperbolic\noperator is a compact perturbation of a hyperbolic one. Conversely, a compact\nperturbation of a hyperbolic operator is essentially hyperbolic. In fact, let H, K\nbe a hyperbolic and a compact operator, respectively: By (b) of Proposition 1.10\nand (3), \u03c3e (H + K) = \u03c3e (H) \u2286 \u03c3(H). Because H is hyperbolic, \u03c3(H) does not\nmeet the imaginary axis, so neither does \u03c3e (H). Therefore, H + K is essentially\nhyperbolic. Thus, by (4) and the remarks after it, we have proved the following\nTheorem 2.6. An operator is essentially hyperbolic if and only if it is a compact\nperturbation of a hyperbolic operator.\nwe denote by eH(E) the set of essentially hyperbolic operators endowed with\nthe topology induced by the operator norm.\nProposition 2.7. eH(E) is an open subset of L(E), and homeomorphic to the\nproduct H(C(E)) \u00d7 Lc (E).\nProof. By Definition 2.1,\n(5)\n\neH(E) = p\u22121 (H(C)),\n\nwhere p is the quotient projection defined in (2). Because the right term is an\nopen subset of L(E), so is eH(E). Because p is linear, continuous and surjective,\nthere exists s : C(E) \u2192 L(E) continuous such that p \u25e6 s = id. This follows from [4,\nProposition A.1]. We define the continuous maps\nf : eH(E) \u2192 H(C(E)) \u00d7 Lc (E),\n\nA 7\u2192 (p(A), A \u2212 s(p(A))),\n\ng : H(C(E)) \u00d7 Lc (E) \u2192 eH(E), (x, K) 7\u2192 s(x) + K.\nBoth are well defined. In fact, by (5), p(A) \u2208 H(C(E)). By the property of s,\np(A \u2212 s(p(A))) = 0,\n\n\f10\n\nGARRISI, D.\n\nthus the L(E) component of f is compact, because Lc (E) = ker(p). As for g,\nbecause p(s(x)) = x \u2208 H(C(E)), by (5), s(x) \u2208 eH(E), hence\n\u03c3e (s(x)) \u2229 iR = \u2205.\nBecause \u03c3e (s(x) + K) = \u03c3e (s(x)), s(x) + K \u2208 eH(E). We conclude the proof by\nchecking that f and g are the inverses of each other:\nf \u25e6 g(x, K) = f (s(x) + K) = (p(s(x) + K), s(x) + K \u2212 s(p(s(x) + K))) = (x, K)\ng \u25e6 f (A) = s(p(A)) + A \u2212 s(p(A)) = A.\n\u0003\nDefinition 2.8. Let x \u2208 A be such that \u03c3 + (x) = \u03c3(x) \u2229 { Re(z) > 0} is open and\nclosed in \u03c3(x). We denote by p+ (x) the projector P (x; { Re(z) > 0}). Similarly, we\ndefine p\u2212 (x).\nProposition 2.9. The map p+ : H(A) \u2192 P(A) defines a homotopy equivalence, a\nhomotopy inverse being the map j : P(A) \u2192 H(A), j(p) = 2p \u2212 1.\nProof. For x \u2208 H(A), \u03c3 + (x) is open and closed in \u03c3(x). Thus, there exists a\nrectangle Q := (\u2212a, a) \u00d7 (\u2212b, b) such that \u03c3(x) \u2282 Q. There is a continuous,\nclosed and simple (in the sense of Definiton 1.2) curve c, such that im(c) = \u2202Q+ .\nThus, p+ (x) = Pc (x). By (iii) of Proposition 1.1, there exists \u03b4 > 0 such that, if\nd(y, x) < \u03b4, then y \u2208 H(A) and \u03c3(y) \u2282 Q. Thus Q+ \u2229 \u03c3(y) = \u03c3 + (y) and p+ (y) =\nPc (y). By Theorem 1.4, Pc is continuous on B(x, \u03b4). Thus, p+ is continuous on a\nneighbourhood of x, namely B(x, \u03b4). Repeating the same argument for every x, we\nobtain that p+ is continuous on H(A).\nGiven a projector p, j(p) is a square root of the unit. In fact,\nj(p)2 = (2p \u2212 1)2 = 4p2 \u2212 4p + 1 = 1.\nThus \u03c3(j(p)) \u2286 {\u22121, 1}, hence j(p) is hyperbolic. Given \u03b6 \u2208 C \\ {\u22121, 1}, we have\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u03b6\n1\n1\n1\nj(p)\n1\n1\n1\n\u22121\n(j(p)\u2212\u03b6) =\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\u2212\nj(p).\n+\n=\n+\n\u2212\n1 \u2212 \u03b62 1 \u2212 \u03b62\n2\n\u03b6 +1 1\u2212\u03b6\n2\n\u03b6 +1 1\u2212\u03b6\nLet c be a simple curve as c(t) = 1 + e\u22122\u03c0it /2. Thus, following the notations of\nDefinition 1.2, we have\n\u03c3 + (j(p)) = \u03c3(j(p)) \u2229 \u03a91 (c).\nTherefore, we can compute the spectral projector relative to 1 \u2208 \u03c3(j(p)) as in\nTheorem 1.4. By integrating both sides of the above equality,\nZ\n1\np+ (j(p)) =\n(j(p) \u2212 \u03b6)\u22121 d\u03b6\n2\u03c0i c\n\u0001 1\n\u0001\n1\n\u2212 indc (\u22121) + indc (1) \u2212\n\u2212 indc (\u22121) \u2212 indc (1) j(p)\n=\n2\n2\n\u0001 1\n1\n= 0 + 1 + j(p) = (1 + 2p \u2212 1) = p.\n2\n2\n\nThe computation above shows that p+ \u25e6 j is the identity map on P(A). To prove\nthat j \u25e6 p+ is homotopically equivalent to the identity on H(A), we define\n\u0001\n\u0001\n(6)\nH(t, x) = (1 \u2212 t)x + t p+ (x) + (1 \u2212 t)x \u2212 t p\u2212 (x).\n\n\fSPECTRAL FLOW IN BANACH SPACES\n\n11\n\nBecause x is hyperbolic, \u03c3 + (x) \u222a \u03c3 \u2212 (x) = \u03c3(x), thus, by (iii) of Theorem 1.4,\n(7)\n\np+ (x) + p\u2212 (x) = 1.\n\nBy (1) and by (ii) of Theorem 1.4, we have\n(8)\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u03c3(H(t, x)) = \u03c3p+ (x) (1 \u2212 t)xp+ (x) + tp+ (x) \u222a \u03c3p\u2212 (x) (1 \u2212 t)xp\u2212 (x) \u2212 tp\u2212 (x)\n= {(1 \u2212 t)\u03c3 + (x) + t} \u222a {(1 \u2212 t)\u03c3 \u2212 (x) \u2212 t}.\n\nThe second equality follows from (i) of Theorem 1.4 applied to p+ (x) (resp. p\u2212 (x))\nand \u03c3 + (x) (resp. \u03c3 \u2212 (x)). Because the subsets of the complex plane { Re(z) > 0}\nand { Re(z) < 0} are convex, the sets in the second line of (8) do not meet the\nimaginary axis, and thus H(t, x) is hyperbolic. Moreover,\nH(0, x) = p+ (x) + p\u2212 (x) = 1\nH(1, x) = p+ (x) \u2212 p\u2212 (x) = 2p+ (x) \u2212 1 = j(p+ (x))\nby (7). Hence H is a homotopy of j \u25e6 p+ with the identity map.\n\n\u0003\n\nBecause Lc (E) is a vector space, thus it is contractible to a point, the projection\nonto the first factor in H(C(E)) \u00d7 Lc (E) is a homotopy equivalence. Together with\nthe last two propositions, we have proved the following\nCorollary 2.10. The map \u03a8 : eH(E) \u2192 P(C(E)), A 7\u2192 p+ (A + Lc (E)) is a homotopy equivalence.\nGiven an essentially hyperbolic operator A, we denote by P + (A) and P \u2212 (A) the\nspectral projectors relative to { Re(z) > 0} and { Re(z) < 0}, respectively.\nProposition 2.11. Given a connected component X \u2282 eH(E), there exists P \u2208\nP(L(E)) such that 2P \u2212I \u2208 X . Moreover, two essentially hyperbolic operators A, B\nbelong to the same connected component X , if and only if there exists T \u2208 GLI (E)\nsuch that\nT P + (A)T \u22121 \u2212 P + (B) \u2208 Lc (E).\nProof. By Proposition 2.7, eH(E) is an open subset of L(E). Thus, X is pathconnected. Let A \u2208 X \u2282 eH(E) be an essentially hyperbolic operator. By Theorem 2.6, there exists a hyperbolic operator H such that\nA \u2212 H \u2208 Lc (E).\nBy the converse of the same theorem, the continuous convex combination\n\u03b3 : t 7\u2192 A + t(H \u2212 A)\nlies in eH(E). Because \u03b3(0) = A \u2208 X , \u03b3(1) = H \u2208 X . By Proposition 2.9,\nj \u25e6 p+ (H) = 2P + (H) \u2212 I is path-connected to H, a path being defined as in (6).\nThus 2P + (H) \u2212 I \u2208 X , and this concludes the first part of the proposition.\nGiven A, B \u2208 X , there exists a path At such that A(0) = A and A(1) = B.\nThus, the path\n\u03b1 := \u03a8 \u25e6 A \u2208 P(C(E))\nconnects \u03b1(0) = \u03a8(A) to \u03b1(1) = \u03a8(B). By Proposition 1.8, the fibration (P(L(E), P(C(E), p)\nsatisfies the homotopy lifting property w.r.t. to the unit interval [0, 1]. Thus, there\nexists a path of projectors P such that\n(9)\n\nP (0) = P + (A), p(P (t)) = \u03b1(t).\n\n\f12\n\nGARRISI, D.\n\nBy Theorem 1.6, there exists T \u2208 GLI (E) such that\nT P + (A)T \u22121 = P (1).\n\n(10)\n\nFrom (9) with t = 1, we obtain\np(P (1)) = \u03a8(B) = p+ (B + Lc (E)) = P + (B) + Lc (E) = p(P + (B)).\nThe second equality follows from the definition \u03a8 and the third one from (iv)\nof Proposition 1.4. Thus, comparing the first and the last terms in the chain of\nequalities above, we obtain\nP (1) \u2212 P + (B) \u2208 Lc (E).\nHence, by (10),\nT P + (A)T \u22121 \u2212 P + (B) \u2208 Lc (E).\n\u0003\n3. The spectral flow\nLet A : [0, 1] \u2192 eH(E) be a continuous path. By Proposition 2.10, \u03a8(A(t)) is\na continuous path in P(C(E)). This path can be lifted to a path of projectors P ,\nsuch that\np(P (t)) = \u03a8(A(t)) = p(P + (A(t)))\nby Proposition 1.8. We define the integer\n(11)\n\nsf(A; P ) := [P (0) \u2212 P + (A(0))] \u2212 [P (1) \u2212 P + (A(1))].\n\nProposition 3.1. The integer sf(A; P ) does not depend on the choice of the path\nof projectors P .\nProof. Let Q be a path of projectors such that p(Q(t)) = p(P (t)). Thus, Q(0)\u2212P (0)\nand Q(1) \u2212 P (1) are compact operators. By (ii) of Theorem 1.12, we have\nsf(A; Q) = [Q(0) \u2212 P + (A(0))] \u2212 [Q(1) \u2212 P + (A(1))]\n= [Q(0) \u2212 P (0)] + [P (0) \u2212 P + (A(0))]\n\u2212 [Q(1) \u2212 P (1)] \u2212 [P (1) \u2212 P + (A(1))] = sf(A; Q)\nBy (iii) of Theorem 1.12, [Q(t) \u2212 P (t)] is constant. Thus, the third equality follows.\n\u0003\nDefinition 3.2. Given A : [0, 1] \u2192 eH(E) continuous, we define the spectral flow\nas the integer sf(A; P ) where P is any of the paths of projectors such that p(P (t)) =\np(P + (A(t))). We denote it by sf(A).\nGiven T \u2208 L(E) and S \u2208 L(F ), we refer to T \u2295 S as the linear operator on E \u2295 F\nsuch that T \u2295S(x, y) = (T x, Sy). Given two paths A and B such that A(1) = B(0),\nwe denote by A \u2217 B the continuous path\n(\nA(2t)\n0 \u2264 t \u2264 1/2\nA \u2217 B(t) =\nB(2t \u2212 1) 1/2 \u2264 t \u2264 1\nProposition 3.3. The spectral flow satisfies the following properties:\n(i) Given two paths A and B such that A(1) = B(0), sf(A\u2217B) = sf(A)+sf(B);\n(ii) the spectral flow of a constant path or a path in H(L(E)) is zero;\n(iii) it is invariant for homotopies with endpoints in H(L(E)) and for fixedendpoint homotopies in eH(E);\n\n\fSPECTRAL FLOW IN BANACH SPACES\n\n13\n\nPn\n(iv) if Ai \u2208 C([0, 1], eH(Ei )) for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n, then sf(\u2295ni=1 Ai ) = i=1 sf(Ai );\n(v) if E is an n-dimensional linear space, then for every integer \u2212n \u2264 k \u2264 n,\nthere is a path such that sf(A) = k;\n(vi) if E has infinite dimension, then for every k there is A such that sf(A) = k.\nProof. (i). Let A, B be two paths such that A(1) = B(0). We can choose paths of\nprojectors P and Q such that p(P (t)) = p(P + (A(t)) and p(Q(t)) = p(P + (B(t))),\nwith Q(0) = P (1). Denote by C and R the paths A \u2217 B and P \u2217 Q, respectively.\nThen,\nsf(A \u2217 B) = [R(0) \u2212 P + (C(0))] \u2212 [R(1) \u2212 P + (C(1))]\n= [P (0) \u2212 P + (A(0))] \u2212 [Q(1) \u2212 P + (B(1))] = [P (0) \u2212 P + (A(0))]\n\u2212 [P (1) \u2212 P + (A(1))] + [Q(0) \u2212 P + (B(0))] \u2212 [Q(1) \u2212 P + (B(1))]\n= sf(A) + sf(B).\n(ii). If A is constant, P + (A(t)) is constant; if A is hyperbolic, P + (A(t)) is continuous. In both cases, P + (A(t)) is a continuous path and can be chosen as a lifting\npath of p(P + (A(t))). Therefore,\nsf(A) = [P + (A(0)) \u2212 P + (A(0))] \u2212 [P + (A(1)) \u2212 P + (A(1))] = 0.\n(iii). Let H : I \u00d7I \u2192 eH(E) be a continuous map. By the homotopy lifting property\nof the fibre bundle p : P(L(E)) \u2192 P(C(E)) w.r.t.

We have\nsf(A) = [P (0, 0) \u2212 P + (H(0, 0))] \u2212 [P (1, 0) \u2212 P + (H(1, 0))].\nFor i = 0, 1 and every s, the operator P (i, s) \u2212 P + (H(i, s)) is compact. For a fixed\ni, the right summand is constant or continuous, whether the homotopy has fixed\nendpoints in eH(E) or lies in H(L(E)). In both cases, is continuous.

Spectral sections. The definition of spectral flow we used corresponds to\nthe one given by C. Zhu and Y. Long in [29] for paths of admissible operators (see\n[29, Definition 2.3]), which are essentially hyperbolic. We recall the definition of\ns-section:\nDefinition 3.4. An s-section for a path of projectors Q on J \u2282 [0, 1] is a continuous\npath P such that P (t) \u2212 Q(t) \u2208 Lc (E).\nGiven a continuous path A : [0, 1] \u2192 eH(E), the authors show in [29, Lemma 2.5]\nand [29, Corollary 2.1] that there exists a partition of the unit interval (Jk )nk=1 and\nPk : Jk \u2192 P(L(E)) such that\n(12)\n\nPk is an s-section for P + (A) on Jk\n\n(13)\n\nPk (t) is a spectral projector of A(t).\n\nThen, they define\n(14)\n\nsf(A) =\n\nn\nX\n\nsf(Ak ; Pk )\n\nk=1\n\nwhere Ak is the restriction of A to Jk . In our definition we do not need to partition the unit interval because we dropped the requirement (13). This allows us\nto simplify the definition of spectral flow and to provide simpler proofs of well\nknown properties - such as the homotopy invariance - than the original ones in [29,\nProposition 2.2] or in [21].\nWe conclude by showing that there exists a path A such that P + (A(t)) does not\nadmit an s-section fulfilling (13).\nExample 3.5. Consider the decomposition E = R1 \u2295 X\u2212 \u2295 X+ , where E is a Banach space, X\u2212 and X+ are closed, infinite-dimensional subspaces and dim(R1 ) = 1.\nDenote by P1 , P\u2212 , P+ the projectors onto R1 , X\u2212 and X+ , respectively. Define\nA : [0, 1] \u2192 eH(E),\n\nA(t) = P+ \u2212 P\u2212 + (2t \u2212 1)P1 .\n\nThen A(t) \u2208 eH(E), and no continuous s-section satisfying (13) exists.\nProof. For every t \u2208 [0, 1] we can write A(t) = P+ \u2212 (P\u2212 + P1 ) + 2tP1 ; because\nP+ \u2212P\u2212 \u2212P1 \u2208 H(L(E)) (in fact, is a square root of the identity) and P1 is compact,\nA(t) \u2208 eH(E). By contradiction, suppose that such P exists. We have\nA(0) = P+ \u2212 P\u2212 \u2212 P1 , P + (A(0)) = P+ , \u03c3(A(0)) = {\u22121, 1}.\nBecause P (0) is spectral, there exists \u03a30 \u2282 \u03c3(A(0)) such that P (0) = P (A(0); \u03a30 ).\nThe only choice is \u03a30 = {1}, thus P (0) = P (A(0); {1}) = P+ . On the other\nendpoint,\nA(1) = P+ \u2212 P\u2212 + P1 , P + (A(1)) = P+ + P1 , \u03c3(A(1)) = {\u22121, 1}.\nAs above, P (1) is spectral and P (1) = P (A(1); {1}) = P+ + P1 . Because P is an\ns-section and P + (A(t)) \u2212 P + (A(s)) is compact for every 0 \u2264 t, s \u2264 1, P (t) \u2212 P (s) is\nalso compact. By (iii) of Theorem 1.12, m(t) := [P (t) \u2212 P (0)] is constant. Because\nm(0) = 0, m(1) = 0. But,\n0 = m(1) = [P (1) \u2212 P (0)] = [(P+ + P1 ) \u2212 P+ ] = [P1 ] = 1\n\n\fSPECTRAL FLOW IN BANACH SPACES\n\n15\n\nwhere the last equality follows from (i) of Theorem 1.12. Thus, we obtained a\ncontradiction.\n\u0003\n4. Spectral flow as group homomorphism\nBy (iii) and (i) of Proposition 3.3, the spectral flow determines a Z-valued group\nhomomorphism on the fundamental group of each connected component of eH(E).\nGiven a projector P , we denote by sf P the spectral flow on the fundamental group\nof the connected component of 2P \u2212 I.\nThe fiber of p : P(L(E)) \u2192 P(C(E)) over a point of the base space, P + Lc (E)\nis the set\nPc (E; P ) = {Q \u2208 P(L(E)) : Q \u2212 P \u2208 Lc (E)}\ni : Pc (E; P ) \u0592\u2192 P(L(E)).\nProposition 4.1. For every projector P , the connected components of Pc (E; P )\ncorrespond to Z through the bijection Q 7\u2192 [P \u2212 Q]. Moreover, if the range and the\nkernel have infinite dimension, \u03c01 (Pc (E; P ), P ) \u223c\n= Z2 .\nThe two facts follow from [13, Theorem 6.3] and [13, Theorems 7.2,7.3].\nBecause p induces a Serre fibration, the sequence of homomorphisms\n(15)\n\ni\u2217\n\n\u03c01 (Pc (E; P ), P )\n\n/ \u03c01 (P(L(E)), P )\n\np\u2217\n\n/ \u03c01 (P(C(E)), P + Lc (E))\n\nis exact. The homotopy equivalence \u03a8 defined in Corollary 2.10 determines a group\nisomorphism\n\u03a8\u2217 : \u03c01 (eH(E), 2P \u2212 I) \u2192 \u03c01 (P(C(E)), P + Lc (E)).\nTheorem 4.2.

Let a be a loop at the base point P +Lc (E), and let Q be a path of projectors\nsuch that Q(0) = P and p(Q(t)) = a(t). Because a(0) = a(1), Q(1) \u2212 P is compact.\nWe define\n\u03b4P ([a]) = [Q(1) \u2212 P ].\nArguing as in Proposition 3.1, \u03b4P is well defined. Let A be a closed path in eH(E)\nand Q a path of projectors such that\np(Q(t)) = \u03a8(A(t)), Q(0) = P.\n+\n\nHence, Q(t) \u2212 P (A(t)) is compact for every t \u2208 [0, 1]. By (11), sf(A) = [Q(1) \u2212 P ].\nBy the definition above, \u03b4P ([\u03a8 \u25e6 A]) = [Q(1) \u2212 P ], thus \u03b4P \u25e6 \u03a8\u2217 = sf P .

We prove that \u03b4P is exact.\nker(\u03b4P ) \u2286 im(p\u2217 ): Let a be a loop at the base point P + Lc (E) such that [a] \u2208\nker(\u03b4P ). Then,\n[Q(1) \u2212 P ] = 0.\nBy Proposition 4.1, P and Q(1) are in the same connected component in Pc (E; P ).\nThus, there exists a continuous path of projectors R such that\nR(0) = Q(1), R(1) = P, R(t) \u2212 P \u2208 Lc (E) for every t.\n\n\f16\n\nGARRISI, D.\n\nSet S := Q \u2217 R. It is a closed path of projectors, and p \u25e6 S = a \u2217 cp(P ) , where cp(P )\nis the constant path p(P ).

Therefore, the proposition follows\nfrom the definition of \u03b4P .\nWe define the following properties:\nh1) P is path-connected to a projector Q such that Q \u2212 P is compact and\n[Q \u2212 P ] = m.\nh2) the image of p\u2217 : \u03c01 (P(L(E)), P ) \u2192 \u03c01 (P(C(E), p(P )) is trivial.\nCorollary 4.4. Given P \u2208 P(L(E)), we characterise the kernel and the image of\nthe spectral flow sf P :\n(i) m \u2208 im(sf P ) if and only if P fulfills property h1).\n(ii) im(p\u2217 ) \u223c\n= ker(sf P ). sf P is injective if and only if P fulfills property h2).\nThe isomorphism classes of the kernel and the image of sf P depend only on the\nconjugacy class of P + Lc (E) in P(C(E)). We show that in many cases we can find\na projector P such that sf P is an isomorphism.\nLemma 4.5. Let E be a Banach space, and X, Y \u2282 E closed subspaces such that\nX \u223c\n= Y and X \u2295 Y = E. Then, the projectors PX , PY with ranges X and Y\nrespectively, are connected by a continuous path in P(L(E)).\nA proof of this can be found in [22, \u00a79] or in [19].\nProposition 4.6. Let X, Y \u2282 E be as above. Suppose that X is isomorphic to its\nclosed subspaces of co-dimension m. Let P be the projector onto X with kernel Y .\nThen P satisfies the property h1) w.r.t. m.\nProof. Let X m , Rm \u2282 X be closed subspaces such that dim(Rm ) = m and X m \u223c\n=\nX. We have the following decompositions and isomorphism:\nE = Rm \u2295 X m \u2295 Y, X m \u223c\n= Y, Rm \u2295 X m = X.\nBy applying Lemma 4.5 to X m \u2295 Y and subspaces X m and Y , we obtain that PX m\nis connected to PY . By applying it a second time to E and subspaces X and Y , we\n\u0003\nobtain that PX is connected to PY . Hence, PX is connected to PX m .\nIn Proposition 4.6, we required E to be isomorphic to a cartesian product of a\nspace X with itself, but it suffices that E has a complemented subspace F fulfilling\nthe requirements of Proposition 4.6. In fact, if At \u2208 eH(F ) is such that sf(At ) = m,\nthen sf(I \u2295 At ) = m, by (iv) of Proposition 3.3.\nProposition 4.7. Given P \u2208 P(L(E)), the map \u03c0 : GL(E) \u2192 P(L(E)), T 7\u2192\nT P T \u22121 defines a principal bundle with fiber GL(X)\u00d7GL(Y ), where X = Range(P )\nand Y = ker(P ).\nA proof of this can be found in [10, Theorem 2.1] or in [4, Proposition 1.2]. Both\ntheorems are stated in the more general setting of Banach algebras.\n\n\fSPECTRAL FLOW IN BANACH SPACES\n\n17\n\nCorollary 4.8. If GL(E) is simply-connected and GL(X), GL(Y ) are connected,\nthen sf P is injective.\nProof. Because a locally trivial bundle is a Serre fibration, we have a long exact\nsequence of homomorphisms that ends\n\u03c01 (GL(E), I)\n\n\u03c0\u2217\n\n/ \u03c01 (P(L(E)), P )\n\n\u2206\n\n/ \u03c00 (GL(X) \u00d7 GL(Y ), I).\n\nThus, if GL(E) is simply connected and GL(X) and GL(Y ) are connected, the\nmiddle group is trivial, hence in (16) p\u2217 is the trivial map, thus \u03b4P is injective and\nsf P is injective.\n\u0003\nThen, we have sufficient conditions for a Banach space to have at least one\nprojector P such that sf P is an isomorphism.\nTheorem 4.9. Let E = X \u2295 X be such that X is isomorphic to its hyperplanes,\nGL(E) is simply-connected and GL(X) is connected. Then sf PX is an isomorphism.\nProof. That sf PX is surjective follows from Proposition 4.6. From the corollary\n\u0003\nabove, sf PX is also injective.\nLet us consider the particular case, where E is isomorphic to E \u00d7 E and to its\nhyperplanes, and GL(E) is contractible to a point. This, in fact, is the case of the\nmost common infinite-dimensional spaces as separable Hilbert spaces, c0 , lp with\np \u2265 1, and Lp (\u03a9, \u03bc) with p > 1, C(K, F ) for large classes of compact spaces K and\nBanach spaces F , and many others. For a richer list, see Theorem 2 of [28] and\n[17, 6, 20, 19]. Sequence spaces lp , l\u221e and c0 are also prime (see [5, Theorem 2.2.4]\nand [18]), that is, they are isomorphic to their complemented, infinite-dimensional\nsubspaces. Thus, for every projector P such that Range(P ) and ker(P ) have infinite\ndimension, sf P is an isomorphism.\nTrivial spectral flow. When P is a projector with a finite-dimensional range or\nkernel, P + Lc (E) is 0 or 1, then its connected component in P(C(E)) is {0} or {1}.\nHence, sf P = 0. This is the case of finite-dimensional spaces. A space is said to\nbe undecomposable if the only projectors are as above. In [14], W. T. Gowers and\nB. Maurey showed the existence of an infinite-dimensional, undecomposable space.\nNon-trivial and not surjective spectral flow. In [15], W. T. Gowers and B. Maurey\nproved the existence of a space isomorphic to their subspaces of co-dimension two,\nbut not their hyperplanes. If we denote by X a space with such a property and by P\nthe projector onto the first factor in E = X \u2295 X, then 2 \u2208 im(sf P ) by Proposition\n4.6. However, if 1 \u2208 im(sf P ), by Proposition 4.3 and c2) in \u00a71.2, X would be\nisomorphic to its hyperplanes.\n4.1. The Douady space.

Let M be the operator defined in the line above. Let Ut \u2208 GL(E) be such\nthat U (1) = M and U (0) = I. The existence of U follows from the fact that T \u2295 T \u2032\nis connected to T T \u2032 \u2295 I ( see [19]). Because M commutes with PX , the path\nP (t) = U (t)PX U (t)\u22121\nis a loop in P(L(E)) with base point PX . We denote its homotopy class by x. The\npath Ut is a lifting path for P . Hence \u2206(x) = U (1) = M .\n\u0003\nLet F and G be Banach spaces such that\n(i) every bounded map G \u2192 F is compact;\n(ii) both F and G are isomorphic to their hyperplanes.\nThe next Lemma follows from a more general result of A. Douady, [12, Proposition 1]. We briefly sketch the proof by B. S. Mitjagin in [19].\nLemma 4.11. Let X = F \u2295 G, F and G as above. Then, there exists a continuous,\nsurjective homomorphism j : GL(X) \u2192 Z.\nProof. Let T \u2208 GL(X) be an invertible operator and S be its inverse. We have\n\u0013\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0012\nT11 S11 + T12 S21 T11 S12 + T12 S22\nIF 0\n= TS =\nT21 S11 + T22 S21 T22 S22 + T21 S12 .\n0 IG\nA similar equality holds for ST . Taking the first element of the diagonals of T S\nand ST , respectively, we have the following relations\nT11 S11 + T12 S21 = IF , S11 T11 + S12 T21 = IF .\nBecause S21 and T21 are compact operators, T11 and S11 are the essential inverse of\neach other. According to (e) of Proposition 1.10, T11 is a Fredholm operator. We\ndefine\nj(T ) = ind(T11 ).\n\u2032\nBy (a) of Proposition 1.10, there exists \u03b5 > 0 such that, if ||T11\n\u2212 T11 || < \u03b5, then\n\u2032\n\u2032\nT11 is a Fredholm operator and ind(T11 ) = ind(T11 ). This proves the continuity.\nMoreover, given two invertible operators T and S, we have\n\nj(T S) = ind(T S)11 = ind(T11 S11 + T12 S21 )\n= ind(T11 S11 ) = ind(T11 ) + ind(S11 ),\nwhere (b) and (c) of Proposition 1.10 have been used. Thus, j is a group homomorphism. Let F 1 and G1 be hyperplanes of F and G, respectively. We define\n\u03c3 : F \u2192 F 1 , \u03c4 : G1 \u2192 G\nF = hvi \u2295 F 1 , G = hwi \u2295 G1\nB : G \u2192 F, tw + y 7\u2192 tv.\nwhere \u03c3, \u03c4 are isomorphisms, which exist by (i). We define\nT (x, y) = (\u03c3(x) + B(y), \u03c4 (P y))\nwhere P : G \u2192 G is a projector onto G1 . T is invertible and ind(T11 ) = ind(\u03c3) =\n\u22121. Because j is a homomorphism, it is surjective.\n\u0003\nProposition 4.12. If E = X \u2295 X, where X is a direct sum of two spaces F and\nG as in (i) and (ii) above, then sf PX is surjective, but not injective.\n\n\fSPECTRAL FLOW IN BANACH SPACES\n\n19\n\nProof. From the lemma above, for every k \u2208 Z, there exists Tk \u2208 GL(X) such\nthat j(Tk ) = k. By Proposition 4.10, there exists xk \u2208 \u03c01 (P(L(E)), PX ) such that\n\u2206(xk ) = Tk \u2295 Tk\u22121 and xk 6= xh if k 6= h. Then \u03c01 (P(L(E)), PX ) has infinitely\nmany elements, while \u03c01 (Pc (E; P ), PX ) is a finite group, by Proposition 4.1. Hence,\nin (15), i\u2217 is not surjective, thus xk 6\u2208 im(i\u2217 ) for infinitely many k \u2208 Z. Hence,\np\u2217 (xk ) 6= 0, \u03b4PX (p\u2217 (xk )) = 0.\nbecause the sequence (15) is exact; therefore, the kernel of \u03b4PX is not trivial. Because E and X fulfill the hypothesis of Proposition 4.6, sf PX is surjective.\n\u0003\nBy [26, Theorem 4.23], examples of pairs of Banach spaces as in (i) and (ii) are\ngiven by (lp , l2 ), with p > 2.\nIn the next proposition, we show the existence of a projector P whose range and\nkernel are isomorphic to their hyperplanes, but sf P = 0.\nProposition 4.13. Let X = F \u2295 G, where F and G fulfill properties (i) and (ii).\nThen, sf PF = 0.\nProof. Let 0 \u2265 \u2212m \u2208 im(sf PF ). Then, by (i) of Corollary 4.4, PF is connected to\na projector Q \u2208 P(L(X)) such that Q \u2212 PF is compact and [PF \u2212 Q] = m. Let\nPm \u2208 P(L(X)) be a projector onto a subspace F m \u2282 F of co-dimension m such\nthat Pm (I \u2212 PF ) = 0. Thus, PF \u2212 Pm is compact and [PF \u2212 Pm ] = m. Therefore,\nQ \u2212 Pm is compact and [Pm \u2212 Q] = 0. By Proposition 4.1, Q is connected to Pm .\nHence, PF is connected to Pm . By Theorem 1.6, there exists a continuous path\nUt \u2208 GL(X) such that\nU (0) = I, U (1)PF = Pm U (1).\nFrom these relations, it follows that U (1)11 (F ) = F m , hence j(U (1)) = \u2212m, and\nj(U (0)) = 0. By the lemma above, j(U (t)) is constant, therefore m = 0.\n\u0003\n5. The Fredholm index of FA and the spectral flow\nDefinition 5.1. A path A : R \u2192 L(E) of bounded operators is said to be asymptotically hyperbolic if the limits A(+\u221e) and A(\u2212\u221e) exist and are hyperbolic operators.\nIf A is also essentially hyperbolic, we can define the spectral flow as follows:\nBecause the set of hyperbolic operators is an open subset of L(E), there exists\n\u03b4 > 0 such that A(t) is hyperbolic for every t \u2208 (\u2212\u221e, \u2212\u03b4] \u222a [\u03b4, +\u221e). We set\n(17)\n\nsf(A) = sf(A, [\u2212\u03b4, \u03b4]).\n\nThe definition does not depend on the choice of \u03b4 by (i,ii) of Proposition 3.3. Let\nP + (A) be the spectral projector P (A; { Re(z) > 0}).\nDefinition 5.2. An asymptotically hyperbolic path is called essentially splitting if\nthe following properties\n(i) P + (A(+\u221e)) \u2212 P + (A(\u2212\u221e)) is compact;\n(ii) [A(t), P + (A(+\u221e))] is compact for every t \u2208 R,\nhold, where [A, P ] = AP \u2212 P A.\nThe definition above corresponds to the one given in [2, Theorem 6.3] when (i)\nholds. For short, we will refer to essentially splitting as a path satisfying (i) and\n(ii).\n\n\f20\n\nGARRISI, D.\n\nLemma 5.3. Let A be an asymptotically hyperbolic and essentially hyperbolic path.\nIt is also essentially splitting if and only if P + (A(t)) \u2212 P + (A(s)) is compact for\nevery t, s \u2208 R.\nProof. Suppose A is essentially splitting. we denote by E + and E \u2212 the ranges of\nP + (A(+\u221e)) and P \u2212 (A(+\u221e)), respectively. With respect to the decomposition\nE = E + \u2295 E \u2212 , we can write A(t) block-wise:\n\u0012\n\u0013\nA+ (t) K\u00b1 (t)\nA(t) =\nK\u2213 (t) A\u2212 (t)\n\nwhere K\u00b1 (t) and K\u2213 (t) are compact operators by (ii). Then A(t) is a compact\nperturbation of A+ (t) \u2295 A\u2212 (t). Therefore\n(18)\n\nP + (A(t)) \u2212 P + (A+ (t)) \u2295 P + (A\u2212 (t)) \u2208 Lc (E) for every t \u2208 R.\n\nBecause A(+\u221e) commutes with P + (A(+\u221e)) and P \u2212 (A(+\u221e)), K\u00b1 (+\u221e), K\u2213 (+\u221e)\nare null operators, hence A(+\u221e) = A+ (+\u221e) \u2295 A\u2212 (+\u221e). By the definition of\nessential spectrum and (b) of Theorem 1.10, \u03c3e (A(t)) = \u03c3e (A+ (t)) \u222a \u03c3e (A\u2212 (t)).\nTherefore,\n(19)\n\nP + (A+ (+\u221e)) = IE + , A+ (t) \u2208 eH(E + )\n\n(20)\n\nP + (A\u2212 (+\u221e)) = 0E \u2212 , A\u2212 (t) \u2208 eH(E \u2212 ).\n\nFrom the first part of (19) and Proposition 2.11,\nA+ (+\u221e) \u2208 XIE+ \u2282 eH(E + ).\nwhere XIE+ is the connected component of IE + in eH(E + ). Because eH(E + ) is\nlocally path-connected, XIE+ is open. Then, by the second part of (19)\nA+ (t) \u2208 XIE+ for every t \u2208 R.\nBy Proposition 2.11,\n(21)\n\nP + (A+ (t)) \u2212 IE + \u2208 Lc (E) for every t \u2208 R.\n\nSimilarly, from (20) and Proposition 2.11, we obtain\n(22)\n\nP + (A\u2212 (t)) \u2208 Lc (E) for every t \u2208 R.\n\nBy the definition of P + (A(+\u221e)), IE + \u2295 0E \u2212 = P + (A(+\u221e)). Thus, by (18,21) and\n(22),\nP + (A(t)) \u2212 P + (A(+\u221e)) \u2208 Lc (E) for every t \u2208 R.\nConversely, suppose that each of the projectors of the set {P + (A(t)) : t \u2208 R} is a\ncompact perturbation of the others. Let a > 0 be such that A(s) is hyperbolic for\nevery |s| > a. By the continuity of P + , it follows that\n\u0010\n\u0011\nP + (A(+\u221e)) \u2212 P + (A(\u2212\u221e)) = s\u2192+\u221e\nlim P + (A(s)) \u2212 P + (A(\u2212s)) .\n|s|>a\n\nbecause A is asymptotically hyperbolic. Hence, the left member is the limit of a\nsequence of compact operators. Because Lc (E) is a closed subset of L(E), we have\nproved (i). Property (ii) follows from the equality\n[A(t), P + (A(s))] = [A(t), P + (A(t))] + [A(t), P + (A(s)) \u2212 P + (A(t))],\nwhere the first summand of the right member is zero and the second one is compact\nby hypothesis. In particular, the equality holds for s > a, so we finish our proof by\ntaking the limit on the left member as s \u2192 +\u221e.\n\u0003\n\n\fSPECTRAL FLOW IN BANACH SPACES\n\n21\n\n5.1. The spectral flow and the Fredholm index of FA . Given a continuous,\nbounded path At \u2208 L(E), we denote by FA the differential operator\ndu\n\u2212 A(*)u.\nFA : W 1,p (R, E) \u2192 Lp (R, E), FA (u) =\ndt\nTheorem 5.4. Let A be an asymptotically hyperbolic and essentially splitting path.\nThen FA is a Fredholm operator and\nind(FA ) = [P \u2212 (A(\u2212\u221e)) \u2212 P \u2212 (A(+\u221e))]\nA. Abbondandolo and P. Majer proved it in [2, Theorem 6.3] where E is a Hilbert\nspace and p = 2. However, the theorem, like much of the content of their work, can\nbe generalised to Banach spaces as in [13, Theorem 3.3].\nTheorem 5.5. Let A be an asymptotically hyperbolic, essentially splitting and essentially hyperbolic path. Then,\nsf(A) = \u2212[P \u2212 (A(\u2212\u221e)) \u2212 P \u2212 (A(+\u221e))]\nProof. Let \u03b4 > 0 as in (17). By Lemma 5.3, the constant path P \u2261 P + (A(\u03b4)) is an\ns-section for P + (At ) on [\u2212\u03b4, \u03b4] in the sense of Definition 3.4. Hence,\nsf(A) = [P + (A(\u03b4)) \u2212 P + (A(\u2212\u03b4))].\nBecause A is hyperbolic on (\u2212\u221e \u2212 \u03b4] \u222a [\u03b4, +\u221e), the path P + (At ) is continuous on\nthis subset. By (iii) of Theorem 1.12,\n[P \u2212 (A(\u2212\u221e)) \u2212 P \u2212 (A(+\u221e))] = \u2212[P + (A(\u03b4)) \u2212 P + (A(\u2212\u03b4))] = \u2212sf(A).\n\u0003\nFrom Theorem 5.5 and Theorem 5.4 we have the final result\nTheorem 5.6. If A is essentially hyperbolic, essentially splitting and asymptotically\nhyperbolic, then\n(23)\n\nind(FA ) = \u2212sf(A).\n\nLet A(t) = A0 (t) + K(t), where A0 (t) is hyperbolic and A0 , A are asymptotically\nhyperbolic. K(t) is compact and\nA0 (t)E \u2212 \u2286 E \u2212 , A0 (t)E + \u2286 E + ;\nE \u2212 = E \u2212 (A0 (\u00b1\u221e)), E + = E + (A0 (\u00b1\u221e)).\nThe second line tells us that P + (A0 (+\u221e)) = P + (A0 (\u2212\u221e)) and thus P + (A(+\u221e))\u2212\nP + (A(\u2212\u221e)) is compact. From the first line, it follows that [A(t), P + (A(+\u221e))] is\ncompact. Thus, by Theorem 5.6, we confirm the guess of A. Abbondandolo and\nP. Majer in [2, \u00a77], that for paths satisfying the hypotheses of [2, Theorem E],\ncorresponding to those listed above, the relation (23) holds.\nWhen A is not essentially splitting, the authors provided in [2, Example 6,7]\ncounterexamples to (23).\n\n\f22\n\nGARRISI, D.\n\nReferences\n[1] Alberto Abbondandolo and Pietro Majer.
