On the one hand, the foregoing bounds\nstill apply, as shown by a projection to a generic plane. On the other hand, no\nbetter bound can be stated, since any planar point set which attains the order\nof magnitude in the Szemer\u00e9di\u2013Trotter bounds, can be considered as a subset of\nR3 (or that of Rd ). However, one might have the feeling that the real question\nwould be to consider proper 3\u2013dimensional (or d\u2013dimensional) sets.\nThe main goal of this paper is to improve the Szemer\u00e9di\u2013Trotter bound(s)\nfor proper 3\u2013dimensional point sets (defined appropriately in the next section).\n\n1\n\n\f1.2\n\nProper d\u2013dimensional point sets\n\n3\nLet H be a (finite) set of n planes in\nin Rd ).\n\u0001 R n(or,\n\u0001 inn\u0001general,\n\u0001 of hyperplanes\nn\nn\n3\nThey cut the space into at most 3 + 2 + 1 + 0 \u223c n open convex cells\n\u0001\nP\n(and into \u2264 di=0 ni \u223c nd in Rd ), with equality iff H is in general position,\ni.e., if any three (in general, any d) share exactly one common point.\n\nDefinition 1.2 A set of N points is proper d\u2013dimensional up to a constant\nfactor\n\u221a C, (for short, \"proper d\u2013D\") if it can be cut into singletons by at most\nC d N appropriate hyperplanes.\n\n1.3\n\nThe main result\n\nTheorem 1.3 Assume that a set P \u2282 R3 of N points is proper 3\u2013dimensional,\nup to a constant factor C.

After some preparatory observations (including our Main Lemma 3.8) in Section 3, the proof of\nTheorem 1.3 comes in Section 4.\n\n1.4\n\nMicha Sharir's \"joints\".\n\nGiven a set of m straight lines L = {L1 , L2 , . . . , Lm }, a joint is a point where\nat least three non-coplanar Li meet. In what follows we denote by J (L) the set\nof joints of L.\n2\n\n\fIt was conjectured by Micha Sharir [?] that if |L| = m then\n|J (L)| \u2264 C * m3/2 ,\nfor an absolute constant C.\nHere we show the validity of this conjecture if J (L) is proper three\u2013dimensional - which is true for all known examples with many joints. Actually, we\nprove somewhat more (though the original problem still remains open).\nTheorem 1.4 If |L| = m and J0 is a proper three\u2013dimensional subset (up to a\nconstant factor C \u2265 1) of the intersections - not necassarily of the joints! -\nthen\n|J0 | \u2264 C 3/2 m3/2 .\n\u221a\nProof: Write n := |J0 | and consider C 3 n planes\u221awhich cut J\u221a\n0 into singletons.\n3\n3\nThen each Li \u2208 L can pass\nthrough\nat\nmost\nC\nn\n+\n1\n\u2264\n2C\nn points of J0 ,\n\u221a\n3\nyielding a total of m * 2C n incidences.\nSince\neach\npoints\nin\nJ\nis\nincident upon\n0\n\u221a\n\u2265 2 lines, we have 2n \u2264 m * 2C 3 n, whence n \u2264 C 3/2 m3/2 .\n\n2\n\nLower bounds\n\nExample 2.1 For the N = n3 points of an n \u00d7 n \u00d7 n cube lattice, and any\n2 \u2264 k \u2264 n,\n(a) the number of k\u2013rich lines is \u03a9(N 2 /k 4 );\n(b) the number of incidences between the lattice points and the k\u2013rich lines is\n\u03a9(N 2 /k 3 ).\n[In general, for any d \u2265 2 and the N = nd points of an n\u00d7n\u00d7. . .\u00d7n cube lattice\nin Rd , we have at least \u03a9(N 2 /k d+1 ) k\u2013rich lines which, of course, produce at\nleast \u03a9(N 2 /k d ) incidences.]\nProof: It suffices to show part (a) since it immediately implies part (b).\nConsider the N = n3 points of {1, 2, . . . , n}3 . First we construct \u03a9(n3 /k 3 )\nstraight lines which all go through the origin (0, 0, 0), such that each of them\ncontains approximately k points of the lattice. These lines will be defined in\nterms of their points (u, v, w) which is closest to the origin.\nWe let the coordinates of these points range through\nn\nn\n,..., ;\n4k\n2k\nn\nv = 1, . . . , ;\n2k\nw = 1, . . . , v\nu=\n\nsuch that gcd(v, w) = 1.\n\n3\n\n\fFor each such (u, v, w), the straight line which passes through it and the\norigin, will also pass through at least 2k and at most 4k points of the cube\nlattice. Moreover, the number of such points (u, v, w) is\n\u0012 3\u0013\n\u0012 2\u0013\nn/(2k)\nX\nn\nn\nn\nn\n*\n*\u0398 2 =\u0398 3 ,\n\u03c6(v) =\n4k v=1\n4k\nk\nk\nwhere \u03c6 - i.e., Euler's function - gives the numberP\nof w \u2208 {1 . . . v} which are\n2\ncoprime to v, and we used the well-known fact that m\ni=1 \u03c6(i) = \u0398(m ).\nNow we shift these lines by each of the vectors (a, b, c) \u2208 {1, 2, . . . , n/2}3 .\nThen each new line will still pass through at most 4k and, this time, at least\nk lattice points. Of course, these (n/2)3 * \u0398(n3 /k 3 ) lines are not all distinct.\nHowever, each occurs with multiplicity at most 4k whence\n\u0012 2\u0013\n\u0012 3\u0013\n\u0012 6\u0013\n\u0012 \u00133\n1\nN\nn\nn\nn\n.\n*\u0398 3 *\n=\u0398 4 =\u0398\nnumber of k\u2013rich lines \u2265\n2\nk\n4k\nk\nk4\nRemark 2.2 A similar construction, with coordinates u1 , u2 , . . . , ud (in place\nof u, v, w), ranging through\nn\nn\n,..., ;\nu1 =\n4k\n2k\nn\nu2 , u3 , . . . , ud\u22121 = 1, . . . , ;\n2k\nud = 1, . . . , ud\u22121\nsuch that gcd(ud\u22121 , ud ) = 1, gives \u0398(N 2 /k d+1 ) lines for a d\u2013dimensional n \u00d7\nn \u00d7 . . . \u00d7 n cube lattice with N = nd points.\nExample 2.3 To show that the bounds in part (iii) of the Main Theorem 1.3\nare best possible for all M and N , we again consider the N = n3 points of and\nn \u00d7 n \u00d7 n cube lattice.\n(a) If M > N 2 /16, we just draw M lines, each through at least one point of\nthe lattice.\n\n(b) For M < N 2/3 = n2 , we pick any M of the n2 lattice lines parallel to, say,\nthe x\u2013axis.\n(c) If N 2 /16 > M \u2265 N 2/3 then we define\ndef\n\n2\u2264k =\n\nN 1/2\nN 1/2\n\u2264\n= N 1/3 = n\n1/4\nM\n(N 2/3 )1/4\n\nand consider the k\u2013rich lines of the lattice. According to Example 2.1.(b), the\nnumber of incidences between these lines and the lattice points is\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012 2\u0013\nN2\nN\n=\n\u03a9\n= \u03a9(N 1/2 M 3/4 ).\n\u03a9\nk3\nN 3/2 /M 3/4\n4\n\n\f3\n3.1\n\nArrangements of planes in R3 .\nDistances and neighborhoods.\n\nLet H be a (finite) set of n planes in R3 (or, in general, of hyperplanes in Rd ),\nas in Section 1.2. If they are in general position then - as it was already\nmentioned there - they cut the space into at most \u223c n3 open convex cells (and\ninto \u223c nd in Rd ). The set of these cells, together with their vertices, edges, and\nfaces, is called the arrangement defined by H. We shall denote it by A(H).\nFor two cells Ci , Cj \u2208 A(H), a natural notion of distance is\ndef\n\ndist(Ci , Cj ) = #{h \u2208 H ; h separates Ci and Cj }.\nA spectacular representation is the following: pick two points Pi \u2208 Ci , Pj \u2208 Cj\nand connect them by a straight line segment. Then the foregoing distance equals\nthe number of h \u2208 H which cut the segment Pi Pj .\nIt is easy to see that \"dist\" is a metric, i.e. it satisfies the triangle inequality.\nOur goal is to bound from above - in terms of |H| - the number of pairs\n(Ci , Cj ) whose distance is at most a given \u033a > 0. This will be achieved in the\nMain Lemma 3.8.\nTo this end, we define the \u033a\u2013neighborhood of a cell Cj by\nB\u033a (Cj ) = {Ci \u2208 A(H) ; dist(Ci , Cj ) \u2264 \u033a},\nand we note that the number of (ordered) \"\u033a\u2013close pairs\" mentioned above\nequals\nX\n|B\u033a (Cj )|.\nCj \u2208A(H)\n\nThe next two subsections recall two well-known results, related to the foregoing\n\u033a\u2013neighborhoods in some sense. Our main tool (Lemma 3.8.) comes after these.\n\n3.2\n\nZones\n\nFor any (hyper)plane h \u2208 H, the zone of h is the set of cells which \"touch\"\nh, i.e., which have a face on h. Also the \u2264 \u033a\u2013zone of h can be defined as\nthe set of cells Cj for which there is another cell Ci in the zone of h for which\ndist(Ci , Cj ) \u2264 \u033a. (In this sense the 0\u2013zone coincides with the original zone of h.)\nTheorem 3.1 (Matou\u0161ek) The number of vertices (and, consequently, that\nof the cells, faces, edges) in the \u2264 \u033a\u2013zone of any h \u2208 H is O(\u033a|H|2 ) in R3 and\nO(\u033a|H|d\u22121 ) in Rd .\nProof: see [Mat88] for the bound on the number of vertices. The rest is implied\nby the fact that - according to the \"general position\" assumption - each\nother object has a vertex furthest from h and each vertex is counted a bounded\nnumber of times (which, of course, depends on the dimension).\n\n5\n\n\fWe also re-state this result in terms of \u033a\u2013neighborhoods. To do so, we shall\nsay that a (hyper)plane h \u2208 H and a \u033a\u2013neighborhood B\u033a (Cj ) are incident upon\neach other if h contains at least one face of at least one cell Ci \u2208 B\u033a (Cj ). (It does\nnot matter whether this face is located in the \"interior\" of the \u033a\u2013neighborhood\nor on its boundary.)\nThe next result says that only O(\u033a) (hyper)planes are incident upon an\n\"average\" neighborhood. More precisely, we have the following.\nCorollary 3.2 For each Cj \u2208 A(H), denote by nj the number of h \u2208 H which\nare incident upon B\u033a (Cj ). Then\nX\nnj = O(\u033a|H|3 )\nCj \u2208A(H)\n\nin R3 and O(\u033a|H|d ) in Rd .\nProof: Note that h is incident upon B\u033a (Cj ) iff Cj is in the \u2264 \u033a\u2013zone of h. The\nrest is just double\u2013counting, using Theorem 3.1.\nWe also state yet another consequence which can be considered as the\n\"younger brother\" (i.e., 2\u2013dimensional version) of the forthcoming Main Lemma 3.8.\nCorollary 3.3 In R2 we have\nX\n\nCj \u2208A(H)\n\n|B\u033a (Cj )| = O(\u033a2 |H|2 ).\n\nProof: Instead of summing the number of cells Ci in each B\u033a (Cj ), we double\u2013\ncount the triples (Cj , h, Ci ) such that h \u2208 H bounds Ci \u2208 B\u033a (Cj ) and separates\nit from Cj .\nOn the one hand, the number of these triples cannot be smaller than the sum\nin question (each pair of cells is counted at least once).\nOn the other hand, for a fixed straight line h \u2208 H and a Cj in the \u2264 \u033a\u2013zone of\nh, the number of the Ci to be counted is at most 2\u033a + 1. (Any two such cells are\nat distance \u2264 2\u033a apart, along the line h.) Thus, using Theorem 3.1 for d = 2,\nwe have\nX\n|B\u033a (Cj )| \u2264 # of triples \u2264 |H| * O(\u033a|H|) * (2\u033a + 1) = O(\u033a2 |H|2 ).\nCj \u2208A(H)\n\nP\nAs for the second moment\n|B\u033a (Cj )|2 , it may not always be bounded by\na quadratic function of |H| (e.g., if the lines all surround a regular polygon\nthen each of its |H| triangular neighbours has \u2265 |H| other cells in its \u033a = 2\u2013\nneighborhood.).\nProblem 3.4 Let A(H) be a simple arrangement\nin R2 . Is it true that it\np\n+\ncan\nP be refined to an2 A(H 4) by 2adding O( |H|) new straight lines such that\nCj \u2208A(H + ) |B\u033a (Cj )| = O(\u033a |H| )?\n6\n\n\fIt may well be true that one can even force the stronger upper bound |B\u033a (Cj )| =\nO(\u033a2 ) for all Cj \u2208 A(H + ) - but it is \"even more\" unknown.\n\n3.3\n\nLevels.\n\nDuring this subsection, we study arrangements located in a fixed Cartesian\ncoordinate system and consider the positive half of the z\u2013axis (or that of the\nxd \u2013axis in Rd ) as pointing \"up\". Thus we can say that a point is \"below\" or\n\"above\" a non-vertical (hyper)plane.\nAlso, while speaking about levels (to be defined immediately), we shall assume that none of the (hyper)planes are vertical.\nThe level of a cell Cj \u2208 A(H) is the number of h \u2208 H which lie below Cj .\nThis can also be visualized by picking a point P \u2208 Cj and drawing a ray from\nP downward; the level of Cj is the number of h \u2208 H which cut this ray.\nTheorem 3.5 (Clarkson) The number of vertices, edges, faces, and cells of\nlevel \u2264 \u033a is O(\u033a2 |H|) in R3 and O(\u033a\u2308d/2\u2309 |H|\u230ad/2\u230b ) in Rd .\nProof: see [Cla88] and also Theorem 6.3.1 in [Mat02] for vertices; for the rest\nproceed as in the proof of Theorem 3.1.\nFrom now on, we stop stating results for dimensions exceeding three. The\nreason for this is that the higher dimensional versions of the forthcoming bounds\n- though usually sharp - do not seem strong enough for extending our Main\nLemma 3.8 to d \u2265 4.\nCorollary 3.6 In R3 , for any Cj \u2208 A(H) and \u033a > 0, we have\n|B\u033a (Cj )| = O(\u033a2 |H|).\nProof: First we pick a point P \u2208 Cj and apply a projective transform \u03c0 which\nmaps P to the point at infinity of the z\u2013axis. Consequently, since no h \u2208 H\ncontains P , no plane h will be mapped into vertical position.\nFor any cell Ci \u2208 B\u033a (Cj ) and any point Pi \u2208 Ci , the segment Pi P intersects\n\u2264 \u033a planes h \u2208 H. Moreover, it is mapped to a vertical ray emanating from\n\u03c0(Pi ) which, of course, can point either downward or upward.\nIn the former case, the image \u03c0(Ci ) is at level \u2264 \u033a in A(\u03c0(H)). According\nto Theorem 3.5, there are O(\u033a2 |H|) such cells.\nOtherwise, in the latter case, we reflect \u03c0(H) and the arrangement about\nthe x\u2013y plane and apply the same Theorem to the reflected image.\nTo sum up, the number of cells in B\u033a (Cj ) is at most twice the bound in\nTheorem 3.5, which still makes O(\u033a2 |H|).\nCorollary 3.7 If B\u033a (Cj ) is incident upon nj planes h \u2208 H then\n|B\u033a (Cj )| = O(\u033a2 nj ).\nProof: Those planes which are not incident upon the \u033a\u2013neighborhood cannot\naffect its size; we can just delete them and then apply Corollary 3.6.\n7\n\n\f3.4\n\nGraphs of short distances.\n\nGiven an arrangement A(H) and a \u033a > 0, we define a graph G\u2264\u033a on the cells\nCj \u2208 A(H) as vertices (one can visualize them as representative points Pj \u2208 Cj )\nand edge set E\u2264\u033a by connecting two cells Ci , Cj (or, equivalently, the points Pi\nand Pj ) by an edge if dist(Ci , Cj ) \u2264 \u033a. Our prime tool bounds the number of\nedges of this graph in terms of \u033a and |H|.\nLemma 3.8 (Main Lemma) In R3 , we have\n|E\u2264\u033a | = O(\u033a3 |H|3 ).\nProof: As in Corollaries 3.2 and 3.7, denote by nj the number of planes h \u2208 H\nwhich are incident upon a cell Cj \u2208 A(H). Then\nX\nX\nO(\u033a2 nj ) =\n|B\u033a (Cj )| =\n|E\u2264\u033a | =\nCj \u2208A(H)\n\nCj \u2208A(H)\n\n= \u033a2 O\n\n\u0012 X\n\nnj\n\nCj \u2208A(H)\n\n4\n\n\u0013\n\n= \u033a2 O(\u033a|H|3 ) = O(\u033a3 |H|3 ).\n\nProof of the Main Theorem 1.3.\n\nWe demonstrate parts (i)\u2013(iii) one by one, following (and suitably adapting) an\ningenious idea of J. Solymosi [?].\nProof of part (i): Assume that\na set P \u2282 R3 of N points can be cut into\n\u221a\n3\nsingletons by a set H of n \u2264 C N planes. In other words, each cell contains\nat most one point P \u2208 P. Moreover, let 2 \u2264 k \u2264 n be arbitrary.\nDefine\n3n\n.\n\u033a=\nk\nWe shall make use of the graph G\u2264\u033a of pairs of cells Ci , Cj \u2208 A(H), for which\ndist(Ci , Cj ) \u2264 \u033a.\nFirst we consider a k\u2013rich line l and assume that the points of l \u2229 P are\nP1 , P2 , . . . , Pk in this linear order. This l intersects each of the n planes h \u2208 H\nat most once. Therefore, at most k/3 of the segments between consecutive pairs\nof points Pi Pi+1 will intersect more than \u033a planes - otherwise there would be\nstrictly more than (k/3) * (3n/k) = n intersections.\nHence there remain at least\n(k \u2212 1) \u2212\n\n3k \u2212 3 \u2212 k\nk\nk\n=\n\u2265\n3\n3\n6\n\nsegments which are cut by \u2264 \u033a planes h \u2208 H. In terms of the graph G\u2264\u033a , each\nk\u2013rich line contributes at least k/6 edges. (Moreover, the latter are all distinct\n\n8\n\n\fsince each cell contains at most one point and two points determine an unique\nline.)\nSince the number of edges satisfies |E\u2264\u033a | = O(\u033a3 n3 ) by the Main Lemma 3.8,\nwe have\n\u0013\n\u0012\n3\nn\n3\n\u0012 6\u0013\nO 3 *n\nk\nO(\u033a3 n3 )\nn\nnumber of k\u2013rich lines \u2264\n=O 4 =\n=\nk\nk/6\nk\n6\n\u0012 2\u0013\nN\n=O\n.\nk4\n\nProof of (ii): As a generalization of what was said before, we assume that a\nstraight line l passes through kl \u2265 k points of the proper 3\u2013dimensional point\nset P. Then, just as we have seen, at most k/3 (which is at most kl /3) segments\nwill be cut by more than \u033a = 3n/k planes h \u2208 H, giving way to at least\n(kl \u2212 1) \u2212\n\nkl\n3kl \u2212 3 \u2212 kl\nkl\n=\n\u2265\n3\n3\n6\n\n\"close pairs\" and thus at least this many edges of G\u2264\u033a . Turning this upside\ndown, for each such line we have that the number of incidences generated by l\nis at most six times the number of edges of G\u2264\u033a on l. Summing for all k\u2013rich\nlines, the total number I of incidences satisfies\n\u0013\n\u0012 2\u0013\n\u0012 3\nN\nn\n.\nI \u2264 6 * |E\u2264\u033a | = 6 * O 3 * n3 = O\nk\nk3\n\nProof of (iii): Consider a set of N points, proper 3\u2013dimensional up to a constant\nfactor \u221a\nC. By definition, the set can be cut into singletons by a set H of some\nn \u2264 C 3 N planes.\nFirst,\nnumber of incidences\n\u221a is\n\u221a for such sets and any M straight lines, the \u221a\nO(M 3 N ), since no line can pass through more than C 3 N + 1 \u2264 (C + 1) 3 N =\nO(N 1/3 ) cells of A(H), each of which contains at most one point of the given\nset.\nNext, we show another bound which is better than the previous one for\nM \u2265 N 2/3 .\nDenote by I the number of incidences between our set of N points and M\nlines. (Thus an \"average\" line will be incident upon \u223c I/M points.)\nPut k = I/(2M ) and discard all lines which pass through less than k points.\nDenote by M \u2032 and I \u2032 the number of preserved lines and incidences, respectively.\nIn total, at most M k = I/2 incidences could be discarded whence I \u2032 \u2265 I/2.\nWe distinguish two cases.\n9\n\n\fCase I. If k = I/(2M ) < 2 then we have I < 4M .\nCase II. Otherwise k = I/(2M ) \u2265 2, thus we can apply part (ii) of the\nMain Theorem, which yields\n\u0012 2\u0013\n\u0012 2 3\u0013\nN\nN M\n\u2032\nI/2 \u2264 I = O\n=O\n,\nk3\nI3\nwhence I 4 = O(N 2 M 3 ) i.e. I = O(N 1/2 M 3/4 ). Thus I = O(M + N 1/2 M 3/4 )\nanyway, since the right hand side is an upper bound in either case.\n\nConcluding remarks\nThe following questions remain open.\nProblem 4.1 Is it true for all d \u2265 2 that if a set P \u2282 Rd of N points is proper\nd\u2013dimensional then\n\u0012 2 \u0013\nN\nnumber of k\u2013rich lines = O d+1 ?\nk\nThis order of magnitude, if true, is best possible (as a function of N and k),\nas shown by an N = n \u00d7 n \u00d7 . . . \u00d7 n cube lattice (see Remark 2.2). Perhaps\na positive answer to the following question could help in solving the previous\nproblem.\nProblem 4.2 Is it true for all d \u2265 2 that the edge set E\u2264\u033a of the graph G\u2264\u033a\nof \"short distances\" defined in terms of an arrangement of n hyperplanes in Rd\nsatisfies\n|E\u2264\u033a | = O(\u033ad nd )?\n(For d = 1 the statement is obvious while the cases d = 2 and d = 3 are\nCorollary 3.3 and the Main Lemma 3.8, respectively.)\n\nReferences\n[Cla88] K Clarkson.
