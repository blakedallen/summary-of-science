Berndt's edition of Ramanujan's Notebooks, Volume 5\n[1, p. 521] reads (in part):\n\"Let m :=\n\nn(n+1)\n,\n2\n\nwhere n is a positive integer. Then, as n approaches infinity,\n\nn\nX\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n\u223c ln(2m) + \u03b3 +\n\u2212\n+\n\u2212\n+\n\u2212 [* * * ].\"\n2\n3\n4\nk\n2\n12m 120m\n630m\n1680m\n2310m5\nk=1\n\n(The entry includes terms up to m\u22129 .)\nBerndt's proof simply verifies (as he himself explicitly notes) that Ramanujan's expansion\ncoincides with the standard Euler expansion\nHn :=\n\nn\nX\n1\nk=1\n\nk\n\n\u223c ln n + \u03b3 +\n= ln n + \u03b3 \u2212\n\n1\n1\n1\n\u2212\n+\n\u2212 [* * * ]\n2\n2n 12n\n120n4\n\u221e\nX\nBk\nk=1\n\nnk\n\nwhere Bk denotes the k th Bernoulli number and \u03b3 := 0.57721 * * * is Euler's constant.\nHowever, Berndt does not show that Ramanujan's expansion is asymptotic in the sense\nthat the error in the value obtained by stopping at any particular stage in Ramanujan's\nseries is less than the next term in the series. Indeed we have been unable to find any error\nanalysis of Ramanujan's series.\n1\n\n\fWe therefore offer the following error analysis which shows the first five terms of Ramanujan's series to be asymptotic in the sense above. Our methods can be extended to any\nnumber of terms in the expansion, but we will limit our presentation to the first five.\nBerndt also states that there is no \"natural\" way to obtain an expansion of Hn in powers\nof m. In fact, our method produces the first two terms of Ramanujan's expansion, namely,\n1\n1\n\u2212 120m\n2 , automatically, and the later terms by a simple \"Kummer's transformation\":\n12m\nsee [4, p. 260].\n1\nTheorem 1. Let m := n(n + 1), where n is a positive integer. Then there exists a \u0398n ,\n2\nwith 0 < \u0398n < 1, for which the following equation is true:\nn\nX\n1\nk=1\n\nk\n\n=\n\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n\u0398n\nln(2m) + \u03b3 +\n\u2212\n+\n\u2212\n+\n.\n2\n3\n4\n2\n12m 120m\n630m\n1680m\n2310m5\n\nWe observe that this expansion of Hn does have the property that the error in the value\nobtained by stopping at any particular stage in it is less than the next term since the terms\nalternate in sign and decrease monotonically in absolute value.\nProof.

Finally, the theorem can be checked directly for n = 1, 2, 3, 4.\nNow we note two fascinating corolaries due, in concept, but without the optimal error\nestimates, to the British mathematician Alfred Lodge [5].\nCorollary 1. For every positive integer n, there is a \u03bbn for which\n1+\n\n1\n1\n1\n1 1\n+ + * * * + = ln(2m) + \u03b3 +\n2 3\nn\n2\n12m +\n\nwhere\n0 < \u03bbn <\n\n6\n5\n\n+ \u03bbn\n\n19\n.\n25200m3\n\nIn fact,\n\n19\n\u2212 \u03c1n ,\n25200m3\n19\n43\n43\n. The constants\nand\nare the best possible.\nwhere 0 < \u03c1n <\n4\n84000m\n25200\n84000\n\u03bbn =\n\nCorollary 2. For every positive integer n, define the quantity \u039bn by the following equation:\n1 1\n1\n1\n1\n1 + + + * * * + =: ln(2m) + \u03b3 +\n.\n2 3\nn\n2\n12m + \u039bn\nThen\n6\n19\n13\n\u03b4n\n\u039bn = \u2212\n+\n\u2212 3,\n2\n5 175m 250m\nm\n187969\n. The constants in the expansion of \u039bn all are the best possible.\nwhere 0 < \u03b4n <\n4042500\n6\n\n\fCorollary 3. For every positive integer n > 1 there exists a number cn , 0 < cn < 1, such\nthat the following approximation is valid:\nHn =\n\n1\ncn\nln(2m) + \u03b3 +\n.\n2\n12m\n\nThe first and second corollaries appeared, in much less precise form and with no error\nestimates, in a very interesting paper by Lodge [5], which later mathematicians inexplicably\nignored. Lodge gives some numerical examples of the error in the approximative equation\nHn \u2248\n\n1\n1\nln(2m) + \u03b3 +\n2\n12m +\n\n6\n5\n\nin Corollary 1; he also presents the first two terms of \u039bn from Corollary 2. An asymptotic\n1\nerror estimate for Corollary 1 (with the incorrect constant 150\ninstead of 1651 15 ) appears as\n19\nExercise 19 on page 460 in Bromwich [2].\nOur third corollary is the exercise (no. 18, page 460) that Bromwich originally proposed\nand is, of course, a trivial consequence of our main theorem. In fact, it is due to E. Ces\u00e0ro\n[3] who proved it in 1885 by a completely different technique. By the way, this was two years\nbefore Ramanujan was born!\nAcknowledgment\nI thank Joseph C.
