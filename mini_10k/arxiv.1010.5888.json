Today, a multitude of\nanalysis tools are employed by scientists and engineers\nstudying nanostructures, each offering its own specific\ncapabilities and advantages. Because each technique can\nsupply different data, when a complex material or structure is being considered it is common that several methods will be used together in order to build a more complete and accurate understanding of the subject.\nOf the various methods in use, there are two techniques that are of particular interest thanks to their unparalleled ability to provide atomic-level imaging. The\nfirst technique, cross-sectional scanning tunnelling microscopy (XSTM), one of the family of scanning probe\nmicroscopy techniques, is well suited for studying semiconductor materials, particularly in the III-V1 and II-VI2\narena. The key strength of XSTM is that it can directly\nvisualize the atomic structure of a material, allowing detailed structural analysis.3,4 However, analysis of nanostructures can be difficult due to the lack of contrast between atomic species, the outward relaxation of the surface, and the two-dimensional nature of the technique.\nDespite this, the great precision of the measurements\nmakes it feasible to infer details that can not otherwise be\ndirectly visualized. For example, statistical analysis and\nfinite element (FE) calculations can be used to 3D create models of the atomic structure.5,6 However, this FE\napproach, in which the outward relaxation of a strained\nsurface is calculated, has an inherent limitation that it is\nnot injective; any measured dataset can be simulated by\na range of different input models.7\nThe second technique under consideration is atom\nprobe tomography (APT). This is the latest evolution\nof the venerable field emission microscope,8 whereby a\nfield ion microscope is combined with a spatially resolved\n\ntime-of-flight mass spectroscope, creating a device known\nas a three dimensional atom probe (3DAP).9 In 3DAP\na needle shaped specimen of material is placed under\na large pulsed voltage causing single ions to be emitted from the specimen's apex and accelerated towards a\ndetector screen. The data collected after each voltage\npulse can be combined to form a three-dimensional tomographic image of the specimen. This technique works\nbest for materials with a high conductivity, where subatomic precision can be achieved, and so traditionally\nthere has been little use for the technique outside of\nmetallic systems.10,11 However, the re-emergence of laser\nbased 3DAP has greatly expanded the range of materials that can be analysed.12 Where semiconductor materials were previously out of bounds, now the additional\nthermal excitation from a pulsed laser makes performing\nAPT on these materials feasible, although with a reduced\nanalytical quality.13 Consequently, pioneering work to\nstudy semiconductor nanostructures, such as quantum\ndots (QDs), has started to be undertaken.14\nIn terms of capabilities, APT seems to complement\nXSTM very well. Where XSTM can image only 2D crosssections, APT provides a 3D tomographic reconstruction,\nand where XSTM has limited capabilities to distinguish\nbetween chemical species, the mass-spectral analysis offers the ability not only to distinguish between different\nelements but also different isotopes. Naturally, these capabilities do not come without a price. The length-scales\nof the volume that can be measured by the 3DAP are typically of the order of tens of nm laterally and hundreds\nof nm vertically, which is far more restrictive than the\nmany \u03bcm that can be imaged with XSTM. Furthermore,\nthe spatial precision is not as great as with XSTM, and\nnot all the emitted ions can be detected. Even in ideal\nconditions detection efficiency is less than 60%.15 Finally,\na particular weakness of APT is that the images of the\nsample must be reconstructed, a process requiring many\nassumptions about factors such as apex shape, radius,\nevaporation conditions and so forth.16,17 The result is\nthat, whilst the 3DAP provides a very unique dataset,\n\n\f2\nthe reliability and spatial accuracy is inherently inferior\nto the direct measurements of XSTM.\n\nII.\n\nEXPERIMENTAL DETAILS\n\nThe studied material is comprised of (Inx ,Ga1\u2212x )As\nself-assembled QD layers in GaAs, grown on an (100)\nGaAs substrate via molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). The\nQD layers were grown by deposition of 2 ML of InAs at\na rate of 0.11 ML/s and at a substrate temperature of\n500\u25e6 C. Formation of the QDs was observed by RHEED.\nVertically, the structure consists of five InAs QD layers\nseparated by 50 nm of GaAs with a 20 nm cap. The separation between the wetting layers (WLs) is considered\nsufficient to suppress strain induced nucleation.18\nFrom atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements\non uncapped material grown under the same conditions,\nthe areal density of the QDs was determined to be\n\u2248 3.0 \u00d7 1010 cm\u22122 . Low temperature (5 K) macro photoluminescence measurements show that the QDs emit\nat an energy of 1.229 eV with a FWHM of 59 meV.\nThe APT measurements were performed using an\nLEAP 3000X Si instrument, operating in laser mode.\nThe laser wavelength was green (532 nm) with a pulse\nfrequency of 0.5 MHz (2 \u03bcs) and a target evaporation rate\nwas set to be 0.2%. The flight length between specimen\nand detector was 90.0 mm and the typical time-of-flight\nof an evaporated ion was 0.6\u20131.6 \u03bcs, depending on the\nspecies. The evaporation rate refers to the probability\nthat, for a given laser pulse, an event will be recorded by\nthe detector. In this experiment, therefore, we aimed to\nachieve a single detection event every 500 pulses, that is,\non average there would be 2 ms between each ion strike.\nThe evaporation field is dynamically altered during the\nmeasurement in order to maintain this target. In general, the field will gradually increase over the course of\nthe experiment as the radius of the specimen tip becomes\nlarger as the specimen is evaporated down. Because the\nposition sensitive detector in the 3DAP is not able to\naccurately distinguish multiple impacts it is important\nthat the evaporation rate is low to maintain a high ratio\nof single ion events.\nThe laser pulse energy was less than 0.01 nJ; such a low\npower was used in order to ensure good data quality.19\nThe sample stage temperature was set to 50 K. The needle shaped specimen was fabricated via standard focused\nion beam (FIB) techniques using a dual-beam FEI Nova\n200 NanoLab system.20,21 Prior to FIB sharpening a protective 100-150 nm Ni layer was sputtered on top of the\nGaAs sample. Inside the FIB system, a further 100150 nm Pt layer deposited on the Ni using the ion beam\ndeposition capabilities of the FIB.\nAll XSTM measurements were performed at room temperature under UHV (p < 6 \u00d7 10\u221211 mbar) conditions\nwith an Omicron STM-1, TS2 Scanner. Electrochemically etched tungsten tips were used. The STM was\noperated in constant current mode on in situ cleaved\n\n(110) surfaces. To ensure that the electronic contribution to the apparent height, as measured by XSTM, is\nminimized, a high negative bias voltage (\u2248 \u22123 V) was\napplied during all measurements resulting in a purely topographic signal22 allowing the identification of individual In atoms.23\nThe strain relaxation, induced by the lattice mismatch\nbetween InAs and GaAs, of the WL and the QDs was\nmodelled with the finite element (FE) method. The FE\ncalculations were performed using the MEMS module of\nCOMSOL Multiphysics. To calculate the strain relaxation of the WL and the QDs a 2D and 3D model was\nused, respectively.\n\nIII.\n\nRESULTS\n\nA comparative view of typical data obtained with the\ntwo techniques of XSTM and APT is shown in Fig. 1.\nFrom this figure, it immediately becomes apparent that\nthe two techniques are of a different nature; where the\nXSTM measurement is restricted to a cleavage plane and\nthus yields information that is 2D in nature, the APT\nmeasurement provides a fully 3D dataset. Even without\nfurther analysis, the WLs and QDs can already be distinguished from Fig. 1a-b. In the following sections, a\ndetailed comparison is given of the WLs, and the QDs,\nas measured by XSTM and APT.\n\nA.\n\nWetting Layer\n\nAn atomically resolved 52 nm \u00d7 19 nm local mean\nequalization filtered current XSTM image of a typical\npart of the WL is shown in Fig. 2a. The WL is found to\nstart abruptly (within one bilayer), followed by a decay\nof the In concentration in the direction of growth. From\nprevious work it is known that the decay of the In concentration can be modelled by an exponentially decaying\nfunction.24 The function a exp(\u2212z/b), with z = 0 the\nstart of the WL and positive z representing the growth\ndirection, was used as an input for the FE modelling that\nwas employed to calculate the outward relaxation of the\ncleaved surface due to the strain in the WL. By adjusting the parameters a and b until the calculated outward\nrelaxation profile (blue line, Fig. 2b), matches the outward relaxation profile as measured by XSTM (red line,\nFig. 2b), the decay of the In concentration can be determined. We find a = 0.188 \u00b1 0.002 and b = 1.95 \u00b1 0.05.\nThe In concentration in the direction of growth can\nalso be determined from the APT data. This is found by\nsampling the composition of 20 nm diameter cylinders,\naligned parallel to the z-axis.25 A small bin length was\nchosen in order not to loose detail of the sharp concentration changes. The thin diameter was chosen so the\ncylinder could be positioned not to coincide with any\nQDs and yet remain close to the core of the specimen,\nwhere the reconstruction is most accurate. The thin di-\n\n\f3\n\nFIG. 1. Comparative view of typical data obtained with the\ntwo techniques under consideration. The five (Inx ,Ga1\u2212x )As\nlayers are clearly visible by both methods. All the scale bars\nare 50 nm. (a) 190 nm \u00d7 165 nm topographic XSTM image\ntaken at V = \u22123 V, I = 30 pA. Several QDs can be distinguished as bright features in the WLs. The thin line parallel\nto the QD layers is an adatom that is being pushed by the\ntip in the slow scan direction. (b) Atom map showing only\nthe In atoms, marked as indigo pixels. The In atoms between\nthe WL are background noise and account for approximately\n0.1\u20130.6\u2030 of the detected atoms. Red isosurfaces show the\nx = 25% In fraction, marking the location of QDs. The top\ninset shows the reconstruction, now also with 20% of the detected Ga atoms (yellow pixels), overlaid on an SEM image\nof the FIB fabricated specimen prior to evaporation. The\nbottom inset shows the remains of the specimen after evaporation.\n\nFIG. 2. WL analysis. (a) 52 nm \u00d7 19 nm local mean equalization filtered current XSTM image of the WL taken at\nV = \u22123 V, I = 40 pA. The start of the WL (red arrow)\noccurs within one bilayer and is followed by a decay of the\nIn concentration in the direction of growth. (b) Outward relaxation profile, averaged over 90 nm of WL, as measured by\nXSTM (red line) and the result of the FE calculation (blue\nline). (c) (top) In fraction of the WL as a function of the\nposition in the direction of growth as measured by APT and\nthe used deconvolution function (yellow line). (c) (bottom)\nDeconvolved APT data and the fit of an exponentially decaying function (yellow line), to the data. To ease comparison,\nthe input for the FE calculation is also plotted (red line).\n\nameter also helps to reduce the effects of curvature in\nthe reconstruction and misalignment of the cylinder to\nthe normal axis, both of which could result in loss of\ndetail in the sharp onset of the WL. In order to ensure\nthat there were no systematic errors in the reconstructions, volumes from different layers and different specimens were compared. To improve the signal-to-noise\nratio, the concentrations of these different sampling volumes were averaged together; this averaged data is shown\nin Fig. 2c (top).\nFrom the XSTM measurements we unambiguously determined that the onset of the WL is abrupt (within one\nbilayer). This is not the case in the APT data, where\n\n\f4\nthe In fraction rises from x = 2% to 15% over a distance\nof \u2206z \u2248 0.7 nm. Despite the measures taken to ensure\na good interface, we consider this artifact to arise from\nthe effect of averaging several volumes, which also do\nnot individually have completely sharp interfaces, causing some error in determination of the start of the WL.\nHowever, since we know that the WL starts abruptly,\nwe can perform a deconvolution of the APT profile in\norder to compensate for this. The deconvolution function was determined by fitting a Gaussian function to\nthe onset of the WL in the APT data, see Fig. 2c (top).\nThe FWHM of this Gaussian function is 0.8 nm and thus\ncan be considered as the instrument profile. This value\ncompares favourably with the resolution obtained from\nlaser-assisted evaporation of Si isotope superlattices.26\nAn alternative technique, known as z-density correction,\ncan also be used to improve interface sharpness in the\ndepth direction.27\nThe deconvoluted APT data is shown in Fig. 2c (bottom). The onset of the WL is now found to occur within\n\u2248 0.35 nm, which is well within one bilayer (0.565 nm),\nand the peak Indium fraction, x, has risen by \u2248 2%, in\nagreement with the XSTM data. An exponentially decaying function in the same form as the input for the FE\ncalculations was used to fit the deconvolved APT data.\nWe find a = 0.189 \u00b1 0.004 and b = 1.95 \u00b1 0.05.\nComparing the two techniques we find an excellent\nmatch of the In segregation profiles. However, to arrive\nat this result a deconvolution of the APT data was necessary. In case no deconvolution function is known and\nz-density correction is not applicable, the APT's ability\nto image sharp interfaces is limited without better data\nreconstruction techniques.\n\nB.\n\nQuantum Dots\n\nHaving shown, with the aid of FE calculations, that\nthe two techniques give comparable results for the WLs\nwe shall now consider the QDs. A total of 55 QDs, 43 by\nXSTM and 12 by APT, were characterized.\nIn Fig. 3, the height and width of all observed QDs is\nplotted. The height of the QDs was determined from the\nXSTM data by counting the number of bilayers in the\ncurrent images, resulting in the discrete nature of the\nplotted data. In APT the height of the QDs was determined from a 1D composition profile sampled by a 10 nm\ndiameter cylinder going though the centre of the QD. The\nwidth is determined from the cross-sectional contour map\nwith a 1 nm projection taken through what is estimated\nto be the longest part of the dot. An example of the\nposition of the cross-section and example measurements\nof major and minor axes are shown in the upper-left and\nupper-centre panels of Fig. 3b, respectively.28 The thickness of the highest QD as measured by XSTM is in agreement with the highest QD observed by APT (2.8 nm vs.\n2.7 nm). At the lower end of the observed height distribution a discrepancy between the two techniques is ob-\n\nserved; the thinnest QD found by XSTM is significantly\nlower than the thinnest QD observed by APT (1.1 nm\nvs. 1.5 nm). This can be explained by the 2D nature of\nthe XSTM technique. Due to the arbitrary position of\nthe cleavage plane we have no a priori way of knowing\nhow a QD is cleaved. If a QD is cleaved near its edge it\nwill appear thinner. The same holds for the width of the\nQDs. This results in a wide range (7\u201322 nm) of observed\nQD widths and in the trend of increasing QD height with\nQD width in the XSTM data seen in Fig. 3a.\nIn the fully 3D dimensional technique of APT the\nheight and width of the QDs can be determined with\nless ambiguity. It is therefore not surprising that the\nheight / width distribution of the QDs as measured by\nAPT is clustered in the top right of Fig. 3a. The spread in\nthe distribution reflects the non-uniformity of the growth\nprocess. By taking cross-sectional contour maps through\nnon-central positions of the QD, as shown in the upperright panel of Fig. 3b, we can emulate the effect of offcentre cleavage. The yellow points in Fig. 3a show the\nwidth and height, measured as the contour map is moved\ntowards the edge of the QD. In contrast to the blue\npoints, where a 1D profile was used to determine the\nheight, in this case it is measured from the x = 25% In\nconcentration contour; this is not as accurate, but it gives\nmore localized measurements.\nIt should also be noted here that there is a substantial\nerror in the width of the QDs with both techniques. Due\nto the gradual transition of WL to QD it is hard to pinpoint where the QD starts. In an effort to increase the\naccuracy, a combination of current and topographic data\nwas used to determine the width of the QDs with XSTM.\nIn the case of the APT the WL profile is first subtracted\nfrom the data. However, with both techniques, an error\nof \u2248 \u00b12 nm remains in the width of the QDs. For reason\nof clarity these error bars are omitted from Fig. 3.\nFigure 4a-b shows the topographic and the local mean\nequalization filtered current XSTM image of a cleaved\nQD. The height and width of this QD was determined\nto be 2.8 nm and 18.0 nm, respectively. As mentioned\nabove, it is normally not known how the cleavage plane\nintersects the QDs with the XSTM technique. However,\nthe statistics of Fig. 3 show that this QD is one of the\nhighest and widest that was observed. Therefore, we can\nreasonably assume that this particular QD was cleaved\nthrough its centre.29 Since not all the individual In atoms\ncan be identified in the XSTM images, it is not possible\nto extract directly an In profile from Fig. 4a-b, and an\nindirect route via APT and FE calculations has to be\ntaken. With APT the In profile of the QDs can readily be obtained. A contour plot of the In concentration\nof a slice through the centre of a QD that was observed\nby APT is shown in Fig. 4c. The QD and slice position is shown in the upper-left panel of Fig. 3b. Because\nthis particular QD was situated near the middle of the\nAPT specimen, and thus suffered least from reconstruction artifacts, it was chosen to link the two techniques of\nXSTM and APT. The height and width was determined\n\n\f5\n\nFIG. 3. QD height / width distribution. (a) The height and\nwidth of the QDs as measured with XSTM (red) was determined from topographic and current images. The APT height\nand width data (blue) is derived respectively from 1D composition profiles of a 10 nm diameter cylinder and cross-sectional\ncontour plots using a 1 nm projection made through the centre of the QD. The yellow APT width data is derived from\nIn concentration contour plots made at 2 nm intervals from\nthe centre of a specific QD and the height data is extracted\nfrom the x = 25% contour. (b) In concentration contour maps\n(25 nm \u00d7 25 nm) of six different QDs looking at the (001) surface. The images are orientated so the nominal longest axis\nis horizontal. The upper-left panel shows the centre position used to make the cross-sectional contour of Fig. 4c. The\nupper-centre panel illustrates how the width was estimated\nfrom cross-sectional contour plots. The arrows in the upperright panel mark the length measured for the yellow points\nin (a). Three more QD footprints are depicted in the bottom\npanels.\n\nto be 2.3 nm and 16.7 nm respectively, making this a\ntypical QD. We would like to note here that a previous\nAPT study has reported the peak In concentration in\nInAs QDs to be off-centred and towards the top of the\nQDs.14 This is not the case in our QDs where the peak\nIn concentration is slightly inclined towards the top and\nlaterally located in the centre.\nConventionally, InAs/GaAs QDs are modelled by a\n\nFIG. 4. Comparative views of two QDs. All images are to\nthe same scale (25 nm \u00d7 13 nm).(a) Topographic and (b) local mean equalization filtered current XSTM image taken at\nV = \u22123 V, I = 40 pA. The height was determined to be\n2.8 nm. (c) contour plot of the In concentration of a 1 nm\nthick slice through the centre of a QD measured by APT.\nThe 3D grid parameters used to create the 2D profile are a\nde-localization of 1.5 nm along the in-plane axes and 0.75 nm\nin the growth direction. The contour lines are every 5%, ranging from 0% to 65%. The height of the QD as measured by\nAPT was determined to be 2.3 nm. The APT data was used\nto construct a model (d) which serves as an input for the FE\ncalculations.\n\n\f6\ndisk or a truncated pyramid with increasing (from bottom to top)6 or inverted-triangular shaped In profiles30 .\nGiven the XSTM and APT data, such an approach cannot be followed with the current QDs. Figure 3b shows\nno strong evidence of faceting or a particular footprint\nfor these QDs. As can be seen from the contour concentration maps the QDs merge into the WL, making edges\nindistinct, and each has a unique irregularity. Therefore,\nwe consider it to be a reasonable first approximation to\nmodel these QDs as long thin spheroids with a circular\nfootprint.\nThe size and shape of buried InAs/GaAs QDs is determined by a delicate interplay between driving and\nquenching of QD levelling during overgrowth31 . Depending on specifics of the growth conditions, the obtained\nQDs can be classified into two general types. The first\nclass is characterized by a sharp interface between the\nQD and the surrounding matrix and is the result of a\nlow growth temperature31 or a low growth rate3,6,24 . In\ncase of a low growth temperature the segregation of In\nout of the WL is strongly suppressed, resulting in a localized WL. In contrast to this, if the first class of QD is\nformed by a low growth rate then a pronounced WL will\nbe present. The second class of QD is associated with a\ngrowth process involving a high growth temperature and\na high growth rate. Under such growth conditions there\nis a strong In segregation (both vertically and laterally)\nduring the overgrowth of the QDs. This results in a pronounced WL and softening of the interface of the QD\nwith the surrounding matrix24,31,32 .\nFrom figure 4a-b we observe that the interfaces of our\nstudied QDs are not sharp and a pronounced WL is\npresent. It is, therefore, clear that these QDs do not\nbelong to the first class and are instead examples of the\nsecond class of QD. We would like to note that it can\nbe problematic to distinguish between these two classes\nin most XSTM and TEM studies of InAs/GaAs QDs,\nthus particular care must be taken when trying to model\nthe QDs. To aid in the construction of a model of our\nQDs two 1D In profiles were extracted from the APT\ndata shown in Fig. 4c: one through its centre along in\nthe growth direction, shown in Fig. 5, and one laterally\nthrough the centre, perpendicular to the growth direction\n(not shown). These data are fitted with analytical functions and scaled to match the width and height of the QD\nobserved by XSTM depicted in Fig. 4a-b. The analytical expressions were then extended in order to generate\na fully 3D model of the QD.33 The result is shown in\nFig. 4d.\nBesides the In profile in the core of the QD, two other\nregions proved crucial in modelling the QD. Firstly, the\nexponential decay of the In concentration in the direction\nof growth above the QD. From the 1D In profile taken\nthrough the centre of the QD, we determined that this\namounts to 16% of the total number of In atoms present;\nsee the marked area in Fig. 5. Note that in the XSTM\nimages of Fig. 4a-b, only a few individual In atoms are\nvisible above the QD and that an exponential decay can-\n\nFIG. 5. 1D In profile in the direction of growth through the\ncentre of the QD shown in Fig. 4c. Analytical functions (solid\nlines) are fitted to the APT data. The In found above the QD\nin this profile is marked by the blue shaded area and amounts\nto 16% of the total amount.\n\nnot be distinguished. Because the area above the QDs\nmeasured by XSTM is very limited a meaningful statistical analysis is not practicable. Consequently, the In in\nthis region are often overlooked. However, the APT data\nreveals that, together, these In atoms actually form a\nsignificant part of the Indium profile and should thus be\nincluded in the model. The second region that is crucial\nin modelling our QDs is the gradual transition of the QD\ninto the WL. The XSTM and APT images of Fig. 4a-c\nshow that the In concentration at the sides of the QD is\nmore substantial than that of the WL which the profiled\nin the previous section. We choose to model this feature\nas a region of x = 15% In fraction which extends well\nbeyond the QD and eventually merges with the WL (not\nshown in Fig. 4d).\nIn Fig. 6, the outward relaxation of the cleaved surface\nacross the centre and 7 nm off-centre of the QD, as measured by XSTM, is plotted together with the result of the\nFE calculations. A close match between the measured\nand the calculated outward relaxation is observed. Here\nit should be noted that different input models, e.g. the\nmodels with a linear In profile mentioned above, can yield\na similar match. However, such models would not resemble the APT data. From this we conclude that care is\nrequired when constructing QD models based on XSTM\nmeasurements alone. Recently, it has been shown7 that\nPL measurements in combination with extensive theoretical modelling and XSTM measurements had to be\ncombined to yield a realistic QD model. However, the\nsubtleties of the decaying In concentration above the QD\nand the extension of the QD into the WL might be overlooked in such an approach, and thus some ambiguity still\nremains. In our view, the abilities of APT in providing\na 3D In profile are at the moment unique, and necessary\nto construct an valid 3D QD model.\n\n\f7\n\nFIG. 6. Outward relaxation of the cleaved surface of the QD\nshown in Fig. 4a-b. The outward relaxation measured by\nXSTM through the centre (red line) and 7 nm off-centre (yellow line) of the QD is compared with the results of the FE\ncalculations (blue lines).\n\nIV.\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nWe have used XSTM and APT to image InAs/GaAs\nQD layers in a single sample. We have found there is\ngood agreement between the segregation profiles of the\nWL obtained by both techniques. To arrive at this re-\n\n1\n\nsult it was necessary to deconvolve the APT data with an\ninstrument profile. The height and length of the QDs determined by both techniques is also comparable, both in\nthe case where cross-sections are taken through the centre of the QD and also where they are taken off-centre.\nThis highlights the versatility of APT whereby the 3D\ndata can be processed in a variety of ways to show a variety of details. Exploiting this advantage, we have used\nthe In profile measured by APT to make a 3D model\nof a typical dot. This model is in agreement with the\noutward relaxation measured by XSTM, and we therefore consider this to be a unique solution. This analysis\nmethod highlights some structural features of the QDs\nthat were undetected or neglected in previous measurements. The juxtaposition of the two techniques shows\nthe unique benefits and capabilities of each one. Thanks\nto their very different natures, by using XSTM and APT\ntogether we can analyse semiconductor nanostructures at\na level of detail that has been previously unobtainable.\n\nJ. A. Kubby and J.
