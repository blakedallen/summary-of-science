Introduction\n\n2. Experiment\n\nHfF+ is one of the candidate species for experiments to\nmeasure the electron electric dipole moment (eEDM). In\nparticular, the long-lived metastable 3 \u22061 state of the ion\npossesses both a long coherence time[2, 3] and a strong\neffective electric field[2, 4], offering enhanced sensitivity\nto an eEDM signal of perhaps as many as two orders of\nmagnitude[1] over the current experimental limit[5]. The\ndegree to which an electron possesses an electric dipole\nmoment is deeply connected to the phenomenon of chargeparity violation in particle physics. A more sensitive measurement of the eEDM will stand to constrain the parameters of various so-called Beyond Standard Model theories\nof high energy physics.\nA crucial aspect of the eEDM measurement is preparing a sample of HfF+ in the state with the highest eEDM\nsensitivity, in a given magnetic sublevel of the J = 1 manifold of 3 \u22061 v = 0. The proposed mechanism for this is\ntwo-color autoionization directly into the science state[6].\nTo this end, we require detailed knowledge of the spectrum\nof HfF to identify intermediate states for the autoionization process.\nSpectroscopy of HfF has previously been done by Adam\net al.[7]. In addition to the present work, we have done\nspectroscopy on HfF using resonantly-enhanced multi-photon\nionization[8]. Also of relevance is the work done by Barker\net al.[3], which is the first spectroscopy of the low energy\nstates of HfF+ , as well as other work by our group investigating the higher energy states of HfF+ [9, 10].\n\nWe use a supersonic beam apparatus similar to that\nwhich is described in Ref. 6. We hold a mixture of 99%Ar\n+ 1%SF6 at 100 psi backing pressure. A pulsed valve opens\nfor 140 \u03bcs and the gas undergoes expansion, achieving supersonic velocities after entering the ablation chamber. A\n30 mJ pulse of focused light at 1064 nm from an Nd:YAG\nlaser ablates material from a Hf target rod 0.14 in. in\ndiameter. The ablation plume is entrained in the supersonic beam and chemically reacts to produce HfF, HfF+ ,\nand other products. The molecular beam passes through a\nbeam skimmer 11 cm from the point of ablation, and then\npasses through a second skimmer 9.6 cm further downstream. The diameters of the first and second skimmers\nare 3 mm and 2 mm respectively, and the region between\nthe skimmers is differentially pumped. At a distance of 8.5\ncm downstream from the second skimmer the molecules\nare interrogated using laser-induced fluorescence (LIF). A\n130 mJ pulse of light, with a linewidth of 0.04 cm\u22121 , from\na tunable dye laser excites the molecules, which then emit\nfluorescence which is collected with a gold-coated spherical\nmirror and focused with an off-axis parabolic mirror onto\nan R3896 Hamamatsu photomultiplier tube (PMT). The\nfluorescence lifetime is long compared to the transit time\nof 15 \u03bcs. In order to temporally gate the prompt scattered\nlight of the fluorescence laser, there is a 6 \u03bcs delay between\nthe laser firing and the beginning of the 9 \u03bcs window where\nthe PMT is active. The wavelength range of our scans was\ncovered by a single dye, LDS722.\nFor the survey spectroscopy in Fig. 1, the dye laser\nis calibrated to Argon lines in an optogalvanic cell, and\nthe laser frequency is determined by interpolating the laser\ngrating position between measurements made with a waveme-\n\n\u2217 Corresponding\n\nauthor\nEmail addresses: graum@jila.colorado.edu (M.

For the highresolution spectroscopy of the individual bands, for example see Fig. 2, the laser frequency is measured at each\npoint in the scan with two separate wavemeters, one with a\nhigh absolute accuracy and the other with high resolution,\nspecified to be 10 MHz. The high-resolution wavemeter is\ncalibrated daily to an external-cavity diode laser locked to\na 87 Rb transition at 384.227982 THz.\n\nanalysis we looked for and subsequently found an eighth\nband outside of the original survey range.\nIn the eight high-resolution scans we see four bands\nwith unresolved isotope splitting, consistent with \u2206v = 0,\nand visibly distinct P, Q, and R branches. Of these bands,\non the basis of the presence or absence of certain low J\nlines, two are clearly (\u03a9\u2032 = 3/2) \u2190 (\u03a9\u2032\u2032 = 3/2), and two\nare clearly (\u03a9\u2032 = 1/2) \u2190 (\u03a9\u2032\u2032 = 3/2) with considerable\n\u03a9-doubling. Based on values of the rotational constants,\nband origin \u03bd, and isotope shifts, we are able to assign\nthese four bands and the remaining four less well-resolved\nbands to a common lower electronic state, with rotational\nconstants in good agreement with the X1.5 state identified\nin Ref. 7. The upper state of these bands we assign to\none of two newly identified electronic states: a state with\n\u03a9\u2032 = 3/2 at 14223 cm\u22121 , which we label [14.2]1.5, and\na state with \u03a9\u2032 = 1/2 at 13833 cm\u22121 , which we label\n[13.8]0.5.\nOn each of the bands acquired at high resolution we\nperform a non-linear least squares fit to a vibrational band\ncontour. The doubling for all \u03a9 = 3/2 levels is unresolved.\nFor the lower states of all eight bands and for the upper\nstates of the bands at 13496, 13554, 14159, and 14223\ncm\u22121 we fit using the following Hamiltonian:\n\n3.

The fit is inverted and displayed\nunder the data. For bands of lower quality such as this, our fit\nonly includes n\u0304 \u03bd, \u03b7, overall intensity and rotational temperature as\nadjustable parameters. Rotational constants are determined from\nfits to other bands.\n\nThe absolute parity of the excited state could not be determined, so following the example in Ref. 7, we label related\npairs as a/b instead of e/f as determined by parity. We do\nnot observe a sufficient number of rotational lines within\neach band to be able to fit a non-zero value to the higher\norder rotational constant D, as such it is not included in\nour fitting models.\nThere are five isotopologs of HfF, labeled n Hf19 F, (with\nn = 180, 179, 178, 177,and 176) each with corresponding\nreduced mass n \u03bc, and respective relative abundances 35.1%,\n13.6%, 27.3%, 18.6%, and 5.26%[12]. For \u2206v = 0 transitions (for instance, as in Figs. 2 and 3) the isotope structure is not resolved in our spectra as it is less than the\n0.04 cm\u22121 linewidth of the LIF laser. For \u2206v = +1 and\n\u2206v = \u22121 transitions the isotope spacing is in principle resolvable, but with the exception of notably sparse regions\nof the spectrum (Fig. 4) we are unable to assign indi-\n\nvidual rotational lines due to the overlapping spectrum of\neach isotopolog (as in Fig. 5).\nIn light of this difficulty we adopt the following fitting\nstrategy. We assume that the rotational constants of each\nisotopolog scale reliably with reduced mass n \u03bc:\nn\n\nB =n\u0304 B(n\u0304 \u03bc/n \u03bc),\n\n(4)\n\nwhere n\u0304 = 178.494 labels the abundance-weighted mass\naverage of Hf, and the quantities n\u0304 \u03bc = 17.171 amu and\nn\u0304\nB are the reduced mass and rotational constant of this\n3\n\n\fn\u0304\n\n\u03bd(cm\u22121 )\n13496.018(8)\n13554.287(4)\n14159.100(4)\n14222.928(6)\n13760.51(8)\n13832.846(8)\n14351.78(6)\n14429.3(1)\n\n\u03a9\u2032\n1.5\n1.5\n1.5\n1.5\n0.5\n0.5\n0.5\n0.5\n\n\u03a9\u2032\u2032\n1.5\n1.5\n1.5\n1.5\n1.5\n1.5\n1.5\n1.5\n\nn\u0304\n\nB \u2032 (cm\u22121 )\n0.2673\n0.2693\n0.2673(8)\n0.2693(4)\n0.2681(8)\n0.2676(8)\n0.2690(20)\n0.2681\n\nn\u0304\n\nB \u2032\u2032 (cm\u22121 )\n0.2791(12)\n0.2822\n0.2822(10)\n0.2839(4)\n0.2822\n0.2833(8)\n0.2822\n0.2838\n\n\u03b7(cm\u22121 /amu)\n-0.176(4)\n-0.172(2)\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0.18(4)\n0.20(6)\n\nv\u2032\n1\n0\n1\n0\n1\n0\n2\n1\n\nv \u2032\u2032\n2\n1\n1\n0\n1\n0\n1\n0\n\n\u03b3(cm\u22121 )\n0.070\n0.070(4)\n0.070\n0.070\n\nTable 1: Molecular constants of vibrational bands of HfF, derived from global non-linear least squares fits. The errors determined by\nbootstrapping the residuals of the non-linear fits are reported in parentheses as one standard deviation of the last digit. Values reported\nwithout uncertainties are held constant in their respective fitting routine. As described in the text, \u03b7 is the per-amu isotope splitting parameter,\nand n\u0304 \u03bd is the band origin of fictitious isotopolog n\u0304 Hf19 F. The fit value for n B is n\u0304B(n\u0304 \u03bc/n \u03bc), and the fit value for n \u03bd is n\u0304\u03bd + \u03b7(n\u0304 \u2212 n)\n\nfictitious mass-averaged isotopolog. Similarly, we take the\nband origins of each isotopolog to be distributed about\ntheir averaged value as follows:\nn\n\n\u03bd =n\u0304 \u03bd + \u03b7(n\u0304 \u2212 n),\n\nEven though the quality of our spectra allows for little redundancy in the determination of the rotational constants B, our assignment of vibrational levels is quite solid.\nObserved isotope shifts are consistent with the assigned\nvalues of \u2206v, and the redundant pair of measurements\nfor the B \u2032\u2032 for X1.5 v = 0 is consistent to a difference\nof < 0.001 cm\u22121 . The two bands with \u03a9\u2032 = 3/2 and\nv = 0 permit a precise determination of \u2206G\u2032\u20321/2 (668.641(7)\ncm\u22121 ) for the X1.5 state, and the two bands with \u03a9\u2032 = 1/2\nand v = 1 give a redundant, if less precise determination\nof the same value. The combined result is in good agreement with, but much more precise than, the previous result\n\u2206G\u2032\u20321/2 = 670(13) cm\u22121 reported by Adam et al[7].\nWe also observe one transition from the v = 2 level of\nthe X1.5 state. From this we are able to report a value\n\u2206G\u2032\u20323/2 = 663.082(9) cm\u22121 . This allows us to extract the\nanharmonicities \u03c9e xe of the X1.5 and the [13.8]0.5 states,\nwhich are 2.78(1) cm\u22121 and 2.6(1) cm\u22121 , respectively. Our\nmeasured value of the ground state \u03c9e xe is consistent with\nthe calculation based on the functional form of a Morse\noscillator[14], \u03c9e2 /4De \u223c 2.0 cm\u22121 , calculated from the\nmeasured bond-dissociation energy De = 54000 cm\u22121 [15].\nA summary of the molecular constants for different vibrational levels of the states X1.5, [13.8]0.5, and [14.2]1.5 is\nin Table 2.\nWe are not aware of published theoretical predictions\nfor HfF, but the authors of Ref. 16 provide predictions\nfor the isoelectronic species HfCl. They predict three clusters of states: (i) three low-lying doublet states including\na ground state 2 \u22063/2 , (ii) a collection of quartet states\naround 9000 cm\u22121 , and (iii) a collection of doublet states\naround 18000 cm\u22121 . In the experimental work on HfF,\nthe authors of Ref. 7, having worked from the assumption\nthat HfF structure will be similar to HfCl, speculated that\nthe seven doublet levels they observed from 17000 cm\u22121\nto 24000 cm\u22121 are part of cluster (iii). If this assumption\nis true, it is plausible that the [14.2]1.5 and [13.8]0.5 levels\nwe have discussed are derived from the nominally quartet\nlevels of group (ii).\n\n(5)\n\nwhere \u03b7 is the per-amu isotope splitting parameter. The\nreduced mass of any isotopolog differs from the average\nmass by a fractional amount of no more than 0.2%, justifying this linear expansion at the level of accuracy we\naspire to. To the extent the isotope shift is dominated by\nthe vibrational contribution, we expect \u03b7 to be\ns\nn\u0304+\u01eb \u03bc\nd\n\u03b7=\n\u2206V,\n(6)\nn\u0304 \u03bc\nd\u01eb\n\u01eb=0\n\nwhere \u2206V is the difference in vibrational energy between\nthe upper and lower states. It is assumed that at our level\nof accuracy we are not able to observe the isotope shift in\nthe spin-doubling parameter \u03b3.\nWe use different fitting procedures for \u2206v = 0 bands\ncompared to \u2206v = \u00b11 bands. For \u2206v = 0 bands we\nassume \u03b7 = 0 and fit values of n\u0304 \u03bd,n\u0304 B \u2032 ,n\u0304 B \u2032\u2032 , temperature, instrumental resolution, and for the \u03a9\u2032 = 1/2 bands\nalso \u03b3. When the same vibrational levels are involved in\nbands with \u2206v 6= 0, we use previously determined values\nof n\u0304B \u2032 ,n\u0304 B \u2032\u2032 , and \u03b3, and fit a contour in order to extract\nn\u0304\n\u03bd and \u03b7 only. The exception to this procedure was for\nthe v = 2 levels of the X1.5 and [13.8]0.5 states. For\nthese states we had no alternative but to extract the corresponding values of B from the less well resolved bands.\nWe calculate tentative, purely statistical, one-sigma error estimates using a bootstrap method on the resampled\nresiduals[13]. This method assumes the fitting model is\nperfect, and ignores the possibility of, e.g., nonthermal rotational populations or other deviations from H\u00f6nl-London\nintensity predictions. We treat these estimates as indicative of the relative sizes of the various error bars. From inconsistencies observed in values of parameters determined\nredundantly by fits to different bands, we find that a global\ndoubling of each error bar is appropriate. A summary of\nthe combined results and rescaled one-sigma error bars is\npresented in Table 1.\n4\n\n\fState\nX1.5\n\n[13.8]0.5\n\n[14.2]1.5\n\nv\n0\n1\n2\n0\n1\n2\n0\n1\n\nn\u0304\n\nT (cm\u22121 )\n\n0\n668.641(7)\n663.082(9)\n13832.846(8)\n14429.3(1)\n15020.42(6)\n14222.928(6)\n14827.741(8)\n\nn\u0304\n\nB(cm\u22121 )\n0.2838(4)\n0.2822(10)\n0.2791(12)\n0.2676(8)\n0.2681(8)\n0.2690(20)\n0.2693(4)\n0.2673(8)\n\n\u03b3(cm\u22121 )\n0.070(4)\n0.070(4)*\n0.070(4)*\n-\n\n\u2206Gv+1/2 (cm\u22121 )\n668.641(7)\n663.082(9)\n596.5(1)\n591.3(1)\n604.813(6)\n\nTable 2: Molecular constants for the observed vibrational states of HfF.

After recording a survey spectrum from 13500 to 14500 cm\u22121 we acquired eight vibrational bands at higher resolution. We perform rotational\nanalysis on these bands, assigning them as vibrational subbands of two new electronic states of HfF, [13.8]0.5 and\n[14.2]1.5. From the analysis we are also able to extract\nrotational constants for the electronic states, as well as\n\u2206G\u2032\u20321/2 and \u03c9e \u03c7e for the ground state.\nAcknowledgments\nWe would like to thank J.
