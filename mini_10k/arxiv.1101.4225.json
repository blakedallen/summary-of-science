Within this model, the observed scaling relations, including the\ntilt of the fundamental plane relative to the virial plane, result primarily from the\ndecrease of gas fraction with increasing progenitor mass. The scatter in the size-mass\nrelation of the remnants is reduced from that of the progenitors because of a\ncorrelation between progenitor size and gas fraction at a given mass.\nKey words: galaxies: interactions \u2013 galaxies: evolution \u2013 galaxies: elliptical and\nlenticular, cD \u2013 galaxies: formation \u2013 methods: .\n\n1\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe merging of disk galaxies is one of the main hypothesized mechanisms for the formation of elliptical galaxies.\nSimulations have shown that mergers of disks with similar masses can effectively disrupt the ordered rotation in\nthe disks and convert it into random velocity support, creating merger remnants that appear similar to observed\nelliptical galaxies (Toomre & Toomre 1972; Toomre 1977;\nBarnes & Hernquist 1992; Mihos & Hernquist 1994). Furthermore, the \u039bCDM cosmology predicts the hierarchical\nbuildup of galaxies through a sequence of mergers. These\n\n\u22c6\n\nemail: joel@scipp.ucsc.edu\n\nresults suggest that merging is a likely mechanism for the\nproduction of elliptical galaxies.\nHowever, observed ellipticals follow a number of scaling\nrelations, including relatively tight relations between stellar\nmass and velocity dispersion, the Faber-Jackson relation\n(Faber & Jackson 1976), and between size and stellar\nmass (Kormendy 1977). Furthermore, observed ellipticals\nfall on a tight plane, the fundamental plane (FP), in the\nthree-dimensional space of stellar mass, size, and velocity\ndispersion (Djorgovski & Davis 1987; Dressler et al. 1987).\nRecent studies of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS)\nhave provided excellent statistics on these scaling relations\nin the local universe (Shen et al. 2003; Bernardi et al.\n2003a,b; Padmanabhan et al. 2004; Gallazzi et al. 2006;\n\n\f2\n\nCovington et al.\n\nShankar et al. 2010), and studies using high redshift surveys\nhave provided evidence for the evolution of these relations\nover cosmological time (Barden et al. 2005; McIntosh et al.\n2005; Trujillo et al. 2006; Trujillo et al. 2007; Cimatti et al.\n2008; van der Wel et al. 2008; Buitrago et al. 2008;\nSaracco et al. 2009; van Dokkum et al. 2010; Fan et al.\n2010; Mancini et al. 2010; Williams et al. 2010). If mergers\nare a major mechanism for the production of elliptical\ngalaxies then they must be able to produce the correct\nscaling relations as well as the evolution of these scaling\nrelations over time. Theoretical high-resolution, hydrodynamical studies have shown that simulations of gas-rich\ngalaxy mergers are capable of reproducing the observed\nscaling relations of elliptical galaxies if the correct progenitor properties are used (Dekel & Cox 2006; Robertson et al.\n2006; Hopkins et al. 2008; Bournaud et al. 2011). These\nstudies have been successful in creating highredshift compact ellipticals from major mergers\nof gas-rich compact disk galaxies (Bournaud et al.\n2010; Wuyts et al. 2010). This is a step toward verifying\nthe production of scaling laws through mergers. However,\ncurrent computing power only allows the simulation of relatively small numbers of mergers, and the space of possible\nmerger initial conditions and progenitor properties is quite\nlarge. Furthermore, these simulations are not placed within\na cosmological context, making it more difficult to explore\nin detail the origin and evolution of scaling relations.\nCurrently, the primary theoretical tool for studying the evolution of statistical samples of galaxies over cosmological timescales is semi-analytic modeling (SAM) (Kauffmann et al. 1993; Cole et al. 1994;\nSomerville & Primack 1999; Cole et al. 2000; Hatton et al.\n2003; Croton et al. 2006; De Lucia et al. 2006; Bower et al.\n2006; Somerville et al. 2008; Fontanot et al. 2009; Benson\n2010; Benson & Bower 2010; Cook et al. 2010; Guo et al.\n2010). These models combine dark matter halo merger trees\nwith analytic recipes for populating the halos with galaxies. However, semi-analytic models (SAMs) do not currently\nincorporate realistic formulas for predicting the properties\nof the remnants of galaxy mergers including the effects\nof dissipation. The agreement between current SAMs and\nobserved early-type scaling relations is not impressive. In\nparticular, the observed size-mass relation of early-types is\nsteeper than that of their potential late-type progenitors\n(Shen et al. 2003), and the scatter in the observed sizemass relation for early-types is remarkably small (Shen et al.\n2003; Nair et al. 2010). The disspationless merger models\ncurrently implemented within SAMs have thus far been unable to reproduce these features (e.g., Shankar et al. 2010;\nGuo et al. 2010). Using a simple power law dissipation\nmodel Khochfar & Silk (2006) were able to reproduce the redshift-size evolution of elliptical galaxies, which, along with the high-resolution hydrodynamical simulations described above, suggests that\ndissipative effects may play an important role in determining elliptical galaxy scaling relations.\nCovington et al. (2008) recently developed a physicallymotivated analytic model for predicting the stellar half-mass\nradii and central velocity dispersions of merger remnants\n(Covington et al. 2008). The parameters in this new merger\nmodel were calibrated using a suite of high-resolution hydrodynamical galaxy merger simulations (see Section 2).\n\nHere we implement a simplified version of this model using post-processing of merger outputs from the SAMs developed by Croton et al. (2006), based on the Millennium simulation (Springel et al. 2005), and Somerville et al. (2008).\nThis results in a population of tens of thousands of merger\nremnants over a large range of redshifts (0 < z < 3) complete with predicted values of size, stellar mass, and velocity dispersion. Comparison of the modeled population of\nellipticals with the observed scaling relations provides an\nimportant test of the merger hypothesis as well as physical insight into the origin and evolution of these relations\nvia merging. It is important to note that the model\npresented here is calibrated only for major mergers of disk-dominated galaxies, and that we make\nno attempt to model subsequent evolution following\nthe formative major merger. Future work will expand\nour model to include minor mergers and mergers\nof bulge-dominated galaxies. We will also implement\nour merger model self-consistently within the semi-analytic\nmachinery rather than by post-processing.\nSection 2.1 describes our analytic merger model for\ncalculating the properties of stellar spheroids from galaxy\nmergers including energy losses from dissipation. Section 2.2\nexplains how we implement our merger model using outputs\nfrom the Croton et al. (2006) and Somerville et al. (2008)\nSAMs. Section 3 systematically explores the effects of the\nmerger model. In order to turn the rather shallow size-mass\nrelation of disk galaxies into the steeper size-mass relation\nof observed early-type galaxies, we find that it is essential\nto include both dissipation and the decreasing gas content\nof more massive progenitor disk galaxies. In Section 4 we\nsummarize the observational results that we compare with\nour model outputs, focusing especially on Sloan Digital Sky\nSurvey (SDSS) data for nearby galaxy size vs. mass and\nother scaling relations, and on data from several surveys\n(Trujillo et al. 2006) for the evolution of these relations to\nhigher redshifts. In section 5 we use the predicted properties\nof progenitor disk galaxies from the two semi-analytic models to predict the size-mass and other relations for spheroids\nformed in major gas-rich mergers and compare them with\nthe observations out to redshift z = 3. Section 6 summarizes these results and discusses their implications and some\nfollow-on studies that are in progress. Finally, an Appendix\ndescribes an improvement in the treatment of the central\ndark matter in the analytic merger model of Covington et al.\n(2008) that we used in Covington (2008) and in the present\npaper.\n\n2\n\nMETHODOLOGY\n\nWe use a combination of modeling approaches to construct a\ntheoretical framework for predicting the evolution of earlytype scaling relations over cosmological time. In previous\nwork, a large suite of hydrodynamical galaxy merger simulations were developed (Cox 2004; Cox et al. 2006, 2008).\nThese simulations were performed using the N-body/SPH\ncode GADGET (Springel et al. 2001; Springel & Hernquist\n2003), and include hydrodynamics, star formation, and stellar feedback. The simulation suite contains mergers with\na wide variety of progenitor properties, mass ratios, and\nmerger orbits. Variations in progenitor properties include\n\n\fThe Role of Dissipation in the Scaling Relations of Cosmological Merger Remnants\na range of stellar masses, gas fractions, dark matter halo\nconcentrations, bulge fractions, baryonic fractions, and gas\ndisk sizes.\nIn subsequent work, Covington et al. (2008, hereafter\nC08) constructed a physically-motivated analytic galaxy\nmerger model capable of predicting the half-mass radii, stellar masses, and velocity dispersions of galaxy merger remnants given the properties of the disk progenitor galaxies\nand the initial orbits of the mergers. This model was calibrated using the galaxy merger suite described above. Unlike previous similar models (Cole et al. 2000; Hatton et al.\n2003), this model includes the effects of star formation and\nenergy loss due to dissipation. Here we combine a simplified\nversion of this new galaxy merger model with merger rates\nand progenitor properties predicted by two semi-analytic\nmodels (SAMs) in order to explore the creation and evolution of the scaling relations of early-type galaxies.\n2.1\n\nDescription of the Merger Model\n\nPrevious models for predicting the sizes and velocity dispersions of galaxy merger remnants employed a combination\nof energy conservation and the virial theorem (Cole et al.\n2000; Hatton et al. 2003). Assuming homology between progenitors and remnants then allows a straightforward calculation of remnant properties. However, the most common\nmergers at higher redshifts are 'wet' mergers of gaseous\ngalaxies, and the approach used previously does not account for energy losses due to gas processes. Recent work\nhas suggested that these dissipative effects play an important role in the formation of elliptical galaxies (Cox et al.\n2006; Robertson et al. 2006; Dekel & Cox 2006; Ciotti et al.\n2007; Cox et al. 2008; Hopkins et al. 2008), though there\nis also evidence that disks may preserved in major, gas-rich mergers (Springel & Hernquist 2005;\nRobertson et al. 2006; Hopkins et al. 2009). C08 develops a framework for modifying the energy conservation\napproach to include dissipative losses due to gas processes.\nIn order to account for dissipative losses, we include a\nradiated energy term within the energy conservation equation. Furthermore, since stars form during the merger, we\ninclude the mass of gas that will form stars when calculating the internal energies of the progenitor galaxies. C08\nfound that the energy lost and the number of new stars\nformed are a function of both the gas fraction and the initial\nmerger orbit. Closer, more disruptive encounters will result\nin greater total energy losses and larger numbers of stars\nforming. However, the set of orbital parameters in the simulations used to calibrate the model was not intended to be\nstatistically representative of mergers in the real Universe.\nRather, it was intended to sparsely span the range of reasonable values. In the present work, we find that when the\nmerger model of C08 is applied to SAMs using the distribution of merger orbital parameters observed in cosmological\nN-body simulations (Benson 2005) there is relatively small\nscatter in remnant properties as the result of orbit. Consequently, for this paper we use a simplified version of the\nmodel in C08 where remnant properties are not a function of\norbit. This simplified model is calibrated to the same suite of\ngalaxy merger simulations (Cox 2004), effectively averaging\nover the range of orbits within the suite.\nAdditionally, the model for calculating remnant central\n\n3\n\ndark matter fractions developed in C08, when applied within\nSAMs, fails for a subset of cases with large radii and high\ngas fractions. Therefore, here we use a new model for calculating central dark matter fractions that has a broader\nrange of applicability (see Appendix A for details). Together, the modifications described result in a simpler model\nthat captures the core dynamics of the more complicated\nmodel of C08. This has the added benefit of reducing the\nnumber of unknown model parameters. However, the scaling relations produced by the two models are not identical,\nand further work now underway implementing these models\nwithin SAMs will be needed to determine whether the simpler model presented here is sufficient (see Section 5.3 for a\ndiscussion of differences).\nThe first step in the new model is to calculate\nthe star formation efficiency of the merger, e. Following\nSomerville et al. (2001) we use\n\u0013\u03b3\n\u0012\nMsat\n.\n(1)\ne = e1:1\nMprimary\nThis formula was calibrated to our merger simulations in\nCox et al. (2008) resulting in parameter values of e1:1 =\n0.55 and \u03b3 = 0.69. For each merger Msat is taken to be the\ntotal mass (dark matter plus baryons) of the less massive\nprogenitor and Mprimary is taken to be the total mass of the\nmore massive progenitor. For each progenitor\nMns = eMgas ,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere Mns is the mass of new stars formed in the merger\nand Mgas is the initial (cold) gas mass of the progenitor.\nAs in C08, we use an energy conservation equation to\ncalculate the half-mass radius of the merger remnant. This\nequation includes final and initial internal energy terms and\na term for energy loss due to gas dissipation,\nEfinal = Einit + Erad .\nThe energy terms are calculated as follows:\n\u0012\n\u0013\n(Ms,1 + Mns,1 )2\n(Ms,2 + Mns,2 )2\nEinit = G\n,\n+\nR1\nR2\nEfinal = G\n\n(Ms,1 + Mns,1 + Ms,2 + Mns,2 )2\n,\nRfinal\n\n(3)\n\n(4)\n(5)\n\nand\nErad = Crad fg Einit,\n\n(6)\n\nwhere Ms,i is the initial stellar mass of progenitor i, Ri is\nthe initial 3D stellar half-mass radius of progenitor i, and\nRfinal is the 3D stellar half-mass radius of the remnant.\nCrad = 2.75 is a constant parameter calibrated using the\nmerger simulations, and\nfg =\n\nMg,1 + Mg,2\nMs,1 + Mg,1 + Ms,2 + Mg,2\n\n(7)\n\nis the merger gas fraction where Ms,i and Mg,i are the\nstellar and gas masses, respectively, of the progenitors. Unlike in C08, here orbital energy is neglected,\nbecause we find that, using orbital parameters observed in cosmological N-body simulations (Benson\n2005), the scatter resulting from orbital effects is\nsmall. In the limit of no dissipation (i.e.fg = 0), Eqs.\n3-5 in our paper reduce to Eqs. 1 and 2 of Naab\n\n\f4\n\nCovington et al.\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\n(d)\n\nFigure 1. Half-mass radii of merger remnants from our simulation suite plotted against radii predicted from our simplified analytic\nmerger model, (a), and the full C08 model with central dark matter density calculated as in Appendix A (c). Panels (b) and (d) show\nthe predictions for velocity dispersions for the simple model and C08 plus Appendix A, respectively. Different symbols represent different\ntypes of progenitor galaxies, described in detail in C08. This new, simpler merger model does not capture variations due to initial\norbit, which is seen in the horizontal spread within symbols of the same size, shape, and color, but we find that the spread\nresulting from this mechanism is insignificant when drawing orbits from the distribution observed in N-body simulations. The simple\nmodel was calibrated with a few more simulations that were not available during the initial calibration in C08.\n\nGCsig Ms,f\n.\nRf (1 \u2212 fdm,f )\n\net al. (2009), if one assumes the proportionality of\neffective and gravitational radii as we do here.\n\n\u03c32 =\n\nOnce we have calculated the final radius, we can compute the velocity dispersion. First, we calculate the central\ndark matter fraction of the merger remnant, fdm,f (see Appendix A for details). Then, as in C08, we calculate the\nremnant velocity dispersion using the virial relation,\n\nMs,f is the stellar mass of the remnant, and Csig = 0.15 is a\nconstant parameter fit to the simulations.\nIn order to determine the parameters Crad and Cvir , we\ncalculated a best-fit of the model to the merger remnants in\nour simulation suite. The fit of the new model is depicted\n\n(8)\n\n\fThe Role of Dissipation in the Scaling Relations of Cosmological Merger Remnants\nin Figure 1a-b, while the results from the C08 model with\nthe modified calculation of central dark matter fraction are\nshown in panels c and d. On average, the new model correctly predicts the remnant sizes and velocity dispersions.\nHowever, there is more spread in the accuracy of predictions in the simple model. This results from variations in\ninitial orbit in our simulation suite. As stated above, we\nfind that this variation is insignificant when mergers\nare calculated for the distribution of orbits found in\ncosmological N-body simulations.\nWe note that our merger model has primarily\nbeen calibrated for major mergers of disk-dominated\ngalaxies. An expansion of this model that includes\na detailed treatment of minor mergers and mergers\nof elliptical galaxies is forthcoming (Porter et al., in\nprep), but here we do not attempt to model subsequent evolution of elliptical galaxies following the\ninitial major merger because the current versions of\nthe SAMs do not track bulge sizes using our dissipative model. In limiting our model to major mergers, we are only examining one avenue of elliptical\ngalaxy formation. Recent works (Naab et al. 2006;\nBournaud et al. 2007) have suggested that ellipticals can also form as a product of minor mergers,\nbut we do not attempt to model this here.\n2.2\n\nImplementation of Merger Model with SAMs\n\nIn order to make comparisons with observational data, and\nto explore the evolution of scaling relations over cosmological time scales, we apply the new merger model to progenitor properties from two SAMs: the Somerville et al. (2008)\nSAM (hereafter S08) and a SAM based on the Millennium\nSimulation (Croton et al. 2006). We implement the merger\nmodel externally (i.e., by post-processing) rather than incorporating it within each of the SAMs. This provides an\nexpedient means of exploring the properties of new elliptical galaxies arriving into the population via the merging of\ndisk-dominated galaxies. We restrict our analysis to mergers of disk galaxies because the current generation SAMs\ndo not have a reliable method for calculating bulge sizes,\nand we need stellar radii in order to calculate initial internal energies. Furthermore, since the merger suite was\ndesigned to model mergers of disk galaxies, there\nwere few bulge-dominated progenitors used to calibrate the merger model. The performance of the\nmodel for mergers of bulge-dominated galaxies has\nnot been tested. Consequently, we only analyze mergers in\neach SAM where both progenitors have a stellar disk more\nmassive than their bulge. Additionally, since we are comparing the remnants to observations of elliptical galaxy populations, we only include major mergers with a mass ratio of\n1:3 or greater, as these are the mergers expected to create\nelliptical galaxies.\nEach SAM directly provides the stellar mass, disk radius, and mass of cold gas for each progenitor. In addition,\nthe model requires information about the dark matter halo\nof each progenitor galaxy. Specifically, we need to be able\nto calculate mass as a function of radius in order to calculate both the halo half-mass radius and the central dark\nmatter mass. S08 and Millennium provide the masses of the\ndark matter halos, but specify the halo mass distributions\n\n5\n\nusing different quantities. S08 provides halo concentrations.\nThe Millennium SAM provides Vmax and Vvir , from which\nconcentration can be calculated. For both cases the concentration, virial mass, and redshift are used to calculate the\ndistribution of mass within the halo. For S08 the spherical\ntop-hat collapse model is used to calculate the virial overdensity, using the approximation from Bryan & Norman (1998),\nwhereas for Millennium the virial overdensity is assumed to\nbe 200. All of these calculations assume the \u039bCDM concordance cosmology, with \u03a9m = 0.3, \u03a9\u039b = 0.7, and h = 0.7.\n\n3\n\nSYSTEMATIC EXPLORATION OF THE\nMERGER MODEL\n\nTo gain a better intuitive grasp of the behavior of the\nmerger model, we systematically explore the effects of variations in the progenitor properties and model parameters.\nFor this study we introduce a series of four idealized progenitor galaxy models. In order to isolate the effects of various\nprogenitor properties we begin with a fiducial progenitor\nand scale the progenitor properties in such as way as to\nkeep baryon fraction, average density, and halo concentration constant.\nThe fiducial galaxy with which we begin our series is\nthe G3 galaxy from Cox et al. (2008), whose properties are\ndesigned to fit the average properties of observed nearby disk\ngalaxies in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. The G3 has a dark\nmatter halo mass of 1.1 \u00d7 1012 M\u2299 , a stellar mass of 5.0 \u00d7\n1010 M\u2299 , an initial half-mass radius of 3.8 kpc, and a halo\nconcentration of 6.0. Each subsequent galaxy in the series\nis created by reducing the mass by 1/3, keeping the average\ndensities, concentration, and baryon fraction constant, and\ncalculating \u03c3 using the virial theorem.\n3.1\n\nEffect of Varying Gas Fraction with Mass\n\nPrevious work has shown that gas can have a significant effect on merger remnants (Barnes & Hernquist\n1996;\nRobertson et al.\n2006;\nDekel & Cox\n2006;\nSpringel & Hernquist 2005; Naab et al. 2006). Dekel & Cox\n(2006) suggest that a systematic variation in gas fraction\nwith mass could be responsible for the tilt in the fundamental plane of elliptical galaxies, and Hopkins et al. (2008)\ndemonstrate observational evidence for this hypothesis.\nThus, we examine the effect of progenitor gas fraction,\ndefined here as the ratio of gas to stellar mass, on the\nproperties of equal-mass merger remnants.\nIn our first experiment we set the gas mass of each progenitor such that gas fraction is constant as a function of\nmass. We run the model for several gas fractions, setting\nthe ratio of gas mass to stellar mass to 0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 1.0,\nand 2.0. The size-stellar mass relation, stellar-mass FaberJackson relation (FJ), and virial projection of the fundamental plane (FP) of the merger remnants are shown in Figure\n2(a).\nSeveral observations are worth noting about the sizemass relations plotted in Figure 2(a). First, for all gas fractions the remnant relations (crosses) are just shifted horizontally and vertically from the progenitor relation (stars)\nwithout any significant rotation (i.e., change of slope). That\nis, the vector between progenitor and remnant is constant\n\n\f6\n\nCovington et al.\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 2. Scaling relations for 1:1 merger remnants produced by our model using a series of idealized progenitors of different\nmass. The progenitors used in (a) have a range of initial gas fractions, which are held constant as a function of mass. For remnants,\ncolors depict ratio of gas mass to stellar mass in the progenitors that created that remnant where black=0.0, light blue=0.25, green=0.5,\nblue=1.0, and red=2.0. Dotted lines connect remnants resulting from progenitors with different mass but the same gas fraction. The\n\u2212\u03b3\n). For remnants, colors\nprogenitors used in (b) have gas fractions that vary as a power law of baryonic mass (Mgas /Mbaryons \u221d Mbaryons\ndepict the value of \u03b3 used to set the progenitor gas fractions black=0.0, red=0.5, and blue=1.0. Dotted lines connect remnants with\nprogenitors from the same gas fraction power law. The top panels show the size-stellar mass relation of the merger remnants (crosses)\nand progenitors (stars), while the middle and lower panels show the stellar mass FJ relation and the fundamental plane for the merger\nremnants, respectively. The solid line plotted in the lowest panels shows the slope for galaxies with a virial scaling, whereas the dashed\nline shows the observed tilt in the FP. Steepening in the size-mass relationship and tilt in the FP are produced by a decreasing gas\nfraction with increasing baryonic mass.\n\nfor any given gas fraction. This means that Rf /Ri and\nMstar,f /Mstar,i are also constant for any particular gas fraction. This is worth noting because the observed size-mass\nrelations for disks and ellipticals are significantly rotated\nfrom one another with the relation for ellipticals being much\n\nsteeper. A realistic mechanism for the production of ellipticals must account for this steepening.\nRemember that the progenitors are constructed so that\nthey have a constant density inside their half-mass radius.\nThus one can quickly see from the plot that 'dry' mergers, with no gas, will produce remnants with densities less\n\n\fThe Role of Dissipation in the Scaling Relations of Cosmological Merger Remnants\nthan their progenitors and sizes larger than their progenitors, whereas gas-rich mergers will produce remnants with\ndensities higher than their progenitors. The sizes of the remnants of gas-rich mergers can be similar to or even smaller\nthan the sizes of their progenitors. For this set of model\nparameters, constant density evolution occurs at roughly a\ngas-to-stellar-mass ratio of 0.25 (light-blue crosses).\nThe stellar-mass FJ plot, in the second panel of Figure 2(a), demonstrates a similar effect. Progenitors are not\nshown because they have no values for \u03c3, however one can\nsee that remnants of mergers with each gas fraction follow\nparallel lines. No rotation is introduced between one gas\nfraction series and the next.\nIf elliptical galaxies followed an exact virial relation,\nthen one would expect that Mstar \u221d \u03c3 2 R. Thus plotting\nthese quantities against each other gives us a 'virial' projection of the fundamental plane. Galaxies following the virial\nrelation would fall on a line with a slope of one. Observed\ngalaxies do not fall on the expected virial relation. This variance from virial scaling is the so-called tilt of the fundamental plane. In the third panel of Figure 2(a) we plot Mstar\nversus \u03c3 2 R. The line plotted has a slope of one and therefore\nfollows a virial scaling. The remnants from each gas fraction\nset fall on the same virial scaling. This demonstrates that\nour model produces no tilt in the fundamental plane for\nremnants when the progenitors' properties are scaled with\nthe mass. However, while each gas fraction series follows the\nvirial scaling, there is a shift between cases with different\ngas fractions such that larger gas fraction progenitors result\nin remnants with larger ratios of stellar mass to dynamical\nmass.\nIn the next experiment we let gas fraction vary as a\nfunction of mass. We fix the gas mass of the largest progenitor (G3) such that the ratio of gas mass to stellar mass is\n0.25. Then we let the baryonic gas fraction vary as a power\n\u2212\u03b3\nlaw with the baryonic mass, Mgas /Mbaryons \u221d Mbaryons\n(as\nsuggested in Dekel & Cox (2006)). We use values of \u03b3 equal\nto 0, 0.5, and 1.0. In Figure 2(b) we show the scaling relations of the remnants produced by this series of progenitors.\nEach line of remnants is fixed to the largest mass remnant,\nbut the slope of the size-mass and FJ relations clearly depends on the value chosen for \u03b3. Non-zero values of \u03b3 allow\nfor significant rotations in all of the plotted projections of the\nFP. The rotation in the size-mass relation is the direction of\nrotation required if one is to create ellipticals from mergers\nof disks that follow the observed relations. Additionally, the\nfundamental plane relation rotates away from the virial relation in the same direction as the observed tilt. For reference,\nthe slope of the observed tilt is shown with a dashed line.\nThe tilt required is slightly overshot by the \u03b3 = 1 case, suggesting that a slightly shallower power law slope would reproduce the observed tilt. This result is compatible with the\ngas fraction power of 0.7 suggested by Dekel & Cox (2006).\nThus within our model a gas fraction gradient is capable of\ncreating a tilt in the fundamental plane.\nOur model relies on the virial relation to calculate sizes\nand velocity dispersion. However, in our model the central\ndark matter fraction is calculated assuming that no dissipation occurs within the dark matter halo, and this affects\nour calculation of \u03c3. The break from virial scaling results\nfrom this changing central dark matter fraction, with more\ngas rich progenitors producing a larger difference between\n\n7\n\nthe dissipational baryons and dissipationless dark matter\nresulting in a lower central dark matter fraction.\nFor large values of \u03b3 some curvature is also introduced\ninto the scaling relations. Since both the disk and elliptical\nscaling relations are approximately power laws, this puts\na constraint on the strength of the gas fraction variation\nallowed by the model if we want to reproduce the observed\nscaling relations. However, the expected value of \u03b3 = 0.7\nonly produces a modest amount of curvature.\n\n3.2\n\nMerger Model Parameters\n\nThe merger model contains several parameters with uncertain values because of the uncertainty in the feedback prescription used by the merger simulations. Because of this\nuncertainty, the values of the model parameters might require adjustment. In order to understand the effect of these\nparameters we vary them systematically and examine the\nresults of these variations on the remnant scaling relations.\nWe begin by varying the star formation efficiency parameter, e1:1 . The calibrated value of this parameter (from\nthe simulations) is 0.55, but for the experiments below we\nuse values of 0.1, 0.5, and 1.0. First, we assume a constant\ngas-to-stellar-mass ratio of 0.5 across the idealized galaxy\nseries. Increasing e1:1 will increase the number of stars that\nform; however, it has little effect on the remnant scaling relations (Figure 3(a)). Specifically, none of the relations experience significant rotation as a result of the adjustment.\nFor all relations an increase in e1:1 simply results in a slight\nshift toward higher stellar mass.\nFor the second experiment with e1:1 , we introduce a\nmass-dependent gas fraction according to the power law relation used above, using the expected value of \u03b3 = 0.7. For\nthis series, adjusting e1:1 produces rotations of the scaling\nrelations. Specifically, changing e1:1 has a greater effect on\nthe mergers with a larger gas fraction, resulting in rotations\nin the size-mass and FJ relations and a slight tilting in the\nFP (Figure 3(b)).\nAnother parameter for which feedback could produce\nsome uncertainty is Crad , which sets the importance of the\nradiative energy term. Since the Crad parameter is decoupled from the equation that determines the number of new\nstars, adjusting Crad results in no difference in final mass.\nHowever, an increase of the parameter results in a significant reduction of size and increase in velocity dispersion\nfor the remnants. The same constant gas fraction and massdependent gas fraction merger series used for the star formation parameter series are plotted in Figures 4(a) and 4(b),\nrespectively, with Crad taking values of 1.0 (black), 3.0 (red)\nand 5.0 (blue). The value of Crad determined by fitting to\nthe merger simulations was 2.75. As with e1:1 , rotation in\nthe scaling relations is only seen for the series with a massdependent gas fraction. Here, a significant rotation is created in the size-mass and FJ relations, but adjusting Crad\nnever introduces a tilt in the FP. This is because the model\nis built on the assumption of the virial theorem, and the\nonly portion of the model that violates this assumption is\nthe formula for calculating the change in central dark matter\nfraction, which is then used to adjust the velocity dispersion.\nChanging Crad does not affect this portion of the model.\n\n\f8\n\nCovington et al.\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 3. Scaling relations for merger remnants produced by the model from our series of idealized progenitors with varying star\nformation parameter e1:1 , which takes values of 0.1 (black), 0.5 (red), and 1.0 (blue). 0.55 is the calibrated value. Dotted lines connect\ncases with the same value of e1:1 . Progenitors in (a) have a constant gas to stellar mass ratio of 0.5, whereas progenitors in (b) have\na changing gas fraction with mass (\u03b3 = 0.7). The top panels show the size-stellar mass relation of the merger remnants (crosses) and\nprogenitors (stars), while the middle and lower panels show the stellar mass FJ relation and the fundamental plane for the merger\nremnants, respectively. The solid line plotted in the lowest panels shows the FP slope for galaxies with a virial scaling. Changing e1:1\naffects the slopes of all three scaling relations, but only when gas fraction varies as a power law of stellar mass (b).\n\n4\n\nSUMMARY OF OBSERVATIONAL RESULTS\n\nThe Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) (York et al. 2000) has\nprovided exquisite statistics on galaxy scaling relations in\nthe local universe. Shen et al. (2003) show that for local\ngalaxies the size distribution for each type of galaxy at a\ngiven stellar mass is log-normal. They provide fitting functions for the medians of the distributions for both early- and\nlate-type galaxies. For late-type galaxies the median (R\u0304) is\ndescribed by\n\nR\u0304(kpc) = \u03b3\n\n\u0012\n\nM\nM\u2299\n\n\u0013\u03b1 \u0012\n\n1+\n\nM\nM0\n\n\u0013\u03b2\u2212\u03b1\n\n,\n\n(9)\n\nwhere \u03b3 = 0.1, \u03b1 = 0.14, \u03b2 = 0.39, and M0 = 3.98\u00d71010 M\u2299 .\nA comparison of this distribution to that of Barden et al.\n(2005), also from SDSS, demonstrates a discrepancy, despite the fact that the samples contain significant overlap.\nSpecifically, a comparison of the stellar-mass size ridge line\nin Somerville et al. (2008) with the figure in Shen et al., correcting for the conversion between disk scale length and half\nlight radius, shows that the Shen et al. distribution is a fac-\n\n\fThe Role of Dissipation in the Scaling Relations of Cosmological Merger Remnants\n\n(a)\n\n9\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 4. Scaling relations for merger remnants produced by the model from our series of idealized progenitors with a varying radiative\nenergy loss parameter Crad , which takes values of 1.0 (black), 3.0 (red), and 5.0 (blue). Crad = 2.75 is the calibrated value from the\nsimulations. Dotted lines connect cases with the same value of Crad . Progenitors in (a) have a constant gas to stellar mass ratio of\n0.5, whereas progenitors in (b) have a changing gas fraction with mass (\u03b3 = 0.7). The top panels show the size-stellar mass relation\nof the merger remnants (crosses) and progenitors (stars), while the middle and lower panels show the stellar mass FJ relation and the\nfundamental plane for the merger remnants, respectively. The solid line plotted in the lowest panels shows the FP slope for galaxies with\na virial scaling. Changing Crad affects the slopes of the size-mass relation and FJ relation for the cases where gas fraction varies as a\nfunction of stellar mass (b), but it does not effect the FP.\n\ntor of \u223c 1.5 smaller in radius for a given mass. Dutton et al.\n(2010) find a similar offset between their re-analysis of SDSS\nand the results of Shen et al., and argue that this was primarily due to their use of circular rather than elliptical apertures. For this work, we scale the fitting function of Shen et\nal. to match the normalization of Barden et al. (2005) and\nDutton et al. (2010).\nFor early-type galaxies the median radius is described\nby\n\nR\u0304(kpc) = b\n\n\u0012\n\nM\nM\u2299\n\n\u0013a\n\n,\n\n(10)\n\nwhere a = 0.56 and b = 3.47 \u00d7 10\u2212 5. The scatter in the\nrelation is similar for both late- and early-types with the fit\nto late-type galaxies being\n\u03c3ln R = \u03c32 +\n\n(\u03c31 \u2212 \u03c32 )\n,\n1 + (M/M0 )2\n\nwhere \u03c31 = 0.47 and \u03c32 = 0.34.\n\n(11)\n\n\f10\n\nCovington et al.\n\nThe fit for the stellar mass Faber-Jackson relation in\nSDSS can be found in Gallazzi et al. (2006), and is given by\n\u22121\n\nlog(\u03c3v (km s\n\n)) = 0.286 log(M\u2217 /M\u2299 ) \u2212 0.895,\n\n(12)\n\nwhere \u03c3v is velocity dispersion and M\u2217 is the stellar mass.\nThe scatter in the relation is 0.071 dex.\nThe fundamental plane relation can be represented in\na number of projections. However, recent work suggests\nthat the tilt of the plane results from a systematic change\nin the central dark matter fraction (Zaritsky et al. 2007;\nHopkins et al. 2008) as the result of a varying effect of dissipation with mass. A number of observational studies have\nexamined the relationship between central dynamical and\nstellar mass,\n1+\u03b1\nMdyn \u221d Mstar\n,\n\n(13)\n\nand have determined a value of \u03b1 \u2248 0.2 (Pahre et al.\n1998; Gerhard et al. 2001; Padmanabhan et al. 2004;\nGallazzi et al. 2006).\nThere is little published data on the evolution of the\nFJ and FP to high redshift, though observations suggest that any evolution in the FP is minimal up\nto z \u223c 1 (Holden et al. 2010; Saglia et al. 2010;\nHerbert et al. 2011). However, a number of studies have\nexamined the evolution of the size-mass relations between\nz \u223c 0 and up to z \u223c 3 (Barden et al. 2005; McIntosh et al.\n2005; Trujillo et al. 2006). The most comprehensive of these\nstudies, Trujillo et al. (2006), combines data from SDSS,\nGEMS (Galaxy Evolution from Morphology and SEDs) and\nFIRES (Faint Infrared Extragalactic Survey) in order to\nquantify evolution between z = 0 and z = 3 for both earlyand late-type galaxies. They differentiate galaxies by light\nconcentration according to S\u00e9rsic index n and find that for\nboth low-n (late-type) and high-n (early-type) galaxies the\nmean size at given mass at z \u223c 2.5 is \u223c 2 times smaller than\ntoday. Specifically they find that at given stellar mass the\nsizes of late-type galaxies evolve as (1+z)\u22120.40\u00b10.06 , whereas\nthe sizes of early-types evolve as (1 + z)\u22120.45\u00b10.10 .\n\n5.1\n\nProperties of the Progenitors\n\nIn the model, the most important properties of the progenitors are initial size, mass, and gas fraction. Thus we begin by\nlooking at the size-mass distributions of progenitors in each\nSAM. The relations are plotted for S08 in Figure 5(a) and for\nMillennium in Figure 5(b). For each figure the progenitors\nare separated into one of six redshift bins according to the\nredshift of the merger. Within each bin, the progenitors\nare divided into mass bins with a width of 0.2 in log(M\u2299 ).\nThe local relations for low-n (solid blue) and high-n (dotted\nred) galaxies are shown for comparison. Additionally, the\nobserved redshift evolution of the size of the low-n galaxies\n(Trujillo et al. 2006) is depicted with the blue-dashed line.\nThis is calculated using the median progenitor redshift in\neach redshift bin.\nThe size-mass relation produced by the progenitors in\nS08 reproduces the observed relation quite nicely, including evolution with redshift. The Millennium progenitors are\nalso fairly close to the observed relation, but in the lowest redshift bin they are \u223c 50% too large on average. This\ngap lessens with increasing redshift. Also of note is that the\nhighest mass bin is typically systematically high. It is also\ninteresting to note the difference in slope between the observed size-mass relations for early- and late-type galaxies.\nAs noted before, if a merger explanation of the elliptical\nsize-mass relation is to be successful, it must explain the rotation between the two observed relations. We discuss this\nwith respect to our model in the next section.\nObserving cold gas within galaxies is extremely challenging. However a study by Kannappan (2004) used a photometric estimate of gas fraction in order to calculate the\nchanging ratio of gas to stellar mass (G/S) with galaxies\nfrom SDSS. Calura et al. (2007) use star formation rates\nfrom a large SDSS sample combined with theoretical modeling to estimate (G/S) as a function of both stellar mass\nand redshift. Neither study provides fits to the observed relation, but it can be seen from Figure 5 of Calura et al. (2007)\nthat, for z < 0.1,\nlog(G/S) \u223c \u22120.5 log(M/M\u2299 ) + C,\n\n5\n\nCOMPARISON WITH OBSERVATIONS\n\nWe now apply our merger model to major mergers of\ndisk-dominated galaxies from the S08 and Millennium\nSAMs. These SAMs produce statistical samples of galaxies\nwith properties that are closely matched to those observed\nin the universe. Thus they provide an effective means for\ntesting the merger model in a cosmological framework. At\nevery time step in the SAMs, we use the data from\nall disk-disk major mergers, regardless of the previous or subsequent merger histories of the disks.\nWe emphasize that we are making no attempt to\nmodel subsequent evolution or mergers of the elliptical remnants. Possible implications of this further\nactivity are examined in Section 6. Since the modeled\nmerger remnants are a function of the disk progenitor properties, we begin by examining the distributions of galaxy\nproperties in the SAMs and making comparisons to the observed distributions.\n\n(14)\n\nwhere for blue galaxies C \u223c 4.6 and for red galaxies C \u223c\n4.1. The values of log(G/S) falls approximately in a range\nbetween -4 and 1.5.\nThe relation between G/S and stellar mass in the SAMs\nis shown in Figures 6(a) and 6(b). The observational relation\n(Equation 14) is also depicted to show that the progenitors\nfrom the SAMs have gas fraction to stellar mass relations\nwith slopes similar to those observed. However, the distribution of progenitor gas fractions from the SAMs is not expected to exactly align with the depicted observed relations\nfor two reasons: 1) even the lowest redshift bin (0 < z < 0.3)\nfrom the SAMs includes redshifts significantly higher than\nthose from the observations (z < 0.1), and 2) the progenitors\nare a small subset of all galaxies. Specifically, the galaxies\nshown from the SAMs are those that undergo major mergers during the specified redshift and are disk-dominated. The\nproperties of this subset may differ from both the red and\nblue populations in the observations. In fact, the models of\nS08 have been tuned to reproduce the gas fraction vs. stellar\nmass observations of Kannappan (2004) for spirals.\nIt can be seen that the distributions of G/S in both\n\n\fThe Role of Dissipation in the Scaling Relations of Cosmological Merger Remnants\n\n(a)\n\n11\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 5.

The\nblue-dashed and red-dotted lines depict the evolution of the low-n and high-n relations respectively with redshift as given by Trujillo et al.\n(2006). This is calculated using the median redshift for the progenitors in each bin. For this and subsequent scaling relations figures,\nblue and red lines denote observed scaling relations of disk and elliptical galaxies respectively.\n\nSAMs are bimodal with a gas-rich (blue) and gas-poor (red)\nsequence. While both SAMs capture the slope of the observed relation, they have gas to baryonic mass power law\nslopes which are significantly less than the \u03b3 = 0.7 value\nsuggested in Dekel & Cox (2006) and the idealized mergers presented above. A majority of the mergers are gas-rich;\n99% and 92% of all mergers, for S08 and Millennium respectively, have total progenitor gas fractions greater than\n0.1. The relation from the SAMs only evolves very modestly over time, but for both SAMs the fraction of mergers\nthat are coming from high gas fraction progenitors increases\nwith increasing redshift. This is seen both as a disappearance of the red sequence (in S08) and a decrease in the typical mass of progenitors as redshift increases (both SAMs).\nA recent study (Tacconi et al. 2010) found that the\ngas fraction of star-forming galaxies increases by a\nfactor of a few as the redshift increases from z = 0\nto z \u223c 2.3. While we have made no selection cuts to\nensure that our spiral progenitors are star-forming,\nthese results suggest that the gas fractions of major\nmergers might increase over time.\nThere are also interesting correlations between gas fraction and size. To demonstrate this, we replot the size-mass\nrelation with points drawn for progenitors colored by G/S\n\n(see Figures 7(a) and 7(b)). Red points are gas-poor with\n\u22122.0 < log(G/S) < \u22121.0. Green points have intermediate\ngas fractions with \u22121.0 < log(G/S) < 0.0. Blue points are\ngas rich with 0.0 < log(G/S) < 1.0. For both SAMs, at\ngiven mass there is a significant trend of gas fraction with\nsize: the larger radius progenitors have higher gas fractions.\nThis is because these galaxies have lower densities and therefore have lower star formation rates and have consumed less\nof their gas, since both SAMs assume a Kennicutt-Schmidttype relationship for star formation (star formation rate density is proportional to a power of the gas density). A similar trend has been observed in a study of nearby\ngalaxies (Catinella et al. 2010). This has important implications for the evolution of scaling relations via merging. Remember that dry merging moves galaxies up and to\nthe right on the plot, that is, it increases both mass and\nsize (Figure 2(a)). Because of their location far above the\nlate-type scaling relation, dry merging would not take the\nlarger radius progenitors on to the desired relation for remnants. However, since these galaxies are gas-rich they can\ntravel with a horizontal or even somewhat downward vector\nwhen they merge. Additionally, this convergence of merging vectors within a single mass bin, such that the gas-poor\ncompact galaxies move to larger radii while the gas-rich low\n\n\f12\n\nCovington et al.\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 6.

The observed relations and SAM progenitors display similar slopes, but the\nrelations are not expected to exactly coincide due to differences in redshift ranges and selection effects.\n\ndensity galaxies move to smaller radii, results in a reduction of scatter for the remnant scaling relations. This effect\nmay contribute to the small scatter in the observed early-type\nsize-mass relation.\n5.2\n\nProperties of the Merger Remnants\n\nGiven progenitor properties, the merger model allows us to\npredict the sizes, stellar masses, and velocity dispersions of\nthe merger remnants. We now exploit this ability to explore\nthe buildup and evolution of the remnant scaling relations\nas predicted by the models. In this subsection we use the\nsimplified merger model described in Section 2. For comparison we will show results on the size-mass relation using the\nmore elaborate C08 model and summing over merger orbits\nin subsection 5.3 below.\nThe remnant size-mass relation for the SAMs is shown\nin Figures 8(a) and 8(b). Note that we are comparing the\nsize-mass relations for all observed early-type galaxies at a\ngiven epoch with that for just the remnants of disk major mergers that occurred in that redshift bin. This neglects early-types that formed at earlier epochs, and have\nnot had a recent merger, as well as early-types formed by\nmixed-morphology mergers. In addition, we only model binary mergers, and do not account for multiple mergers or\n\nsubsequent evolution following the formation event.\nTherefore, this may not be a fair comparison, but it is the\nbest we can do until we implement the merger model within\nSAMs.\nThe model applied to the S08 SAM overpredicts the\ntypical observed sizes for a given mass by about 0.3 dex at\nlow masses, and the slope is steeper than observed. However,\nthe S08 results roughly capture the magnitude of observed\nevolution in average sizes from smaller sizes at high redshift\nto larger sizes at low redshift (see also Trujillo et al. 2006;\nTrujillo et al. 2007; Franx et al. 2008). The slope of the sizemass relation is slightly shallower than the observed slope\nat all redshifts, but the merger model has produced a significant steepening from the progenitor size-mass relation as a\nresult of the mass dependent gas fraction in the progenitors.\nThe average predicted size for early-type galaxies in the\nMillennium SAM is too large, sometimes by more than 0.5\ndex. Millennium produces a different normalization for the\nsize-mass relation than S08 for two reasons: 1) the progenitors are larger, and 2) the progenitors have less gas. The\nslope of the relation is also much shallower than observed.\nThis is likely the result of differences in progenitor gas fractions between the two SAMs. The evolution in the Millennium size-mass relationship is such that in the highest redshift bin (2.5 < z < 3.0) the average size at a given mass\n\n\fThe Role of Dissipation in the Scaling Relations of Cosmological Merger Remnants\n\n(a)\n\n13\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 7. Size-Mass relations for the progenitors in the S08 SAM (a) and Millennium SAM (b), binned by redshift and including points\nfor progenitors colored by gas fraction.

Both SAMs produce systematic gradients in disk galaxy gas\nfractions as a function of size at given mass. This results from higher star formation rates, and therefore faster gas consumption in denser\ngalaxies. When dissipative effects are included in a merger model, these systematic gradients result in smaller scatter in the merger\nremnant size-mass relation.\n\nis \u223c 3 times smaller than in the lowest redshift bin. This is\nwithin the errors on the observed evolution.\nIn addition to sizes, the merger model predicts values for\nvelocity dispersion (\u03c3), so we also examine the stellar-mass\nFaber-Jackson relation (FJ) (see Figures 9(a) and 9(b)). The\nS08 model roughly produces the correct slope for the local\nFJ relation. However, Millennium produces a slightly steeper\nslope than observed in most redshift bins, particularly at\nhigh mass. S08 slightly underpredicts (\u223c 0.05 dex) velocity\ndispersions at z = 0, whereas the offset for the Millennium\nrelation is larger (\u223c 0.2 dex). Since remnants from Millennium are systematically too large, they also have systematically low velocity dispersions. Both SAMs show an evolution\nof the FJ relation with redshift. Within the model there are\ntwo possible mechanisms for evolution in \u03c3 at a given mass:\nevolving size and evolving dark matter halo properties. For\nS08 \u03c3 at a given mass increases by roughly a factor of 1.4\nbetween z = 0 and z = 3; for Millennium \u03c3 increases by\na factor of two. These values are commensurate with the\ndecrease in size at a given mass for S08 and Millennium,\nsuggesting that changing dark matter properties have little effect on the evolution. It is not known yet whether this\nevolution is consistent with the real universe.\nFinally, we examine the fundamental plane (FP) rela-\n\ntion predicted by the merger model. The model uses the\nvirial relation to predict values for \u03c3, however the mass used\nin the model is a dynamical mass that includes a contribution from dark matter. Therefore, if a tilt is produced by the\nmodel in the virial projection of the FP, then it is purely\na result of changing dark matter content in the galaxy centers. In Figures 10(a) and 10(b) we plot the relation between\n\u03c3 2 r \u221d Mdyn and stellar mass. The merger model applied to\nthe S08 progenitors does not reproduce the observed tilt in\nthe FP, with slopes roughly the same as would be expected\nfrom the virial relation. For Millennium the FP is tilted in\nthe same sense as is suggested by observations, with dynamical mass increasing faster than stellar mass, and the\ntilt produced is only slightly less than observed. This tilt results from the contrasting dissipational and dissipationless\nevolution of the baryonic and dark matter components combined with the gas gradient in the progenitors. Lower mass\nprogenitors have higher gas fractions and therefore produce\nmore compact stellar remnants with smaller central dark\nmatter fractions. Higher mass progenitors have smaller gas\nfractions and therefore end up with a sparser stellar center,\nresulting in larger central dark matter fractions.\nPlotting \u03c3 versus r gives a nearly face-on view of the\nFP, and allows us to determine the portion of the FP be-\n\n\f14\n\nCovington et al.\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 8. Size-Mass relations for the remnants in the S08 SAM (a) and Millennium SAM (b), binned by redshift. Lines are observed\nrelations as in Figure 5(a). The S08 SAM captures most of the steepening that occurs between the observed late- and early-type scaling\nrelations, whereas the slope produced by the Millennium SAM remains near that of the progenitors (disks). Both SAMs show roughly\nthe right amount of evolution in size between z=3 and z=0, but both also overpredict the sizes for a given mass.\n\ning populated at a given redshift by major mergers of disk\ngalaxies. We show this relationship for both S08 (Figure\n11(a)) and Millennium (Figure 11(b)). Both SAMs show a\ncorrelation between \u03c3 and r such that galaxies with larger\nsizes also tend to have larger velocity dispersions. This is\nsimilar to a correlation observed at low redshift in the SDSS\n(Graves et al. 2009). Most interesting perhaps is the noticeable evolution with redshift across the face of the FP. At\nhigh redshift the mergers produce primarily high \u03c3 galaxies with relatively small sizes. As time progresses toward\nz = 0, the typical \u03c3 of a merger remnant decreases and the\ntypical size increases, as the correlation between the size\nand velocity dispersion marches across the face of the plane.\nGraves et al. (2009) also see this correlation between \u03c3 and\nage, but not between size and age. Also, at any given redshift\nthere is a stronger correlation between \u03c3 and r in our model\nthan seen in SDSS. However, as discussed earlier, in reality each bin would also contain remnants that were formed\nat earlier times, which would weaken the correlation. Furthermore, one would expect that the remnants from higher\nredshifts would be modified by further merging, which could\nalso increase the radius and scatter across the plane. An interesting question that remains unanswered is whether there\nare specific regions of the FP space that are not populated\nby major merging. We are working on further studies of the\nage and metallicity predicted by our merging model imple-\n\nmented self-consistently within the SAMs, and will report\nthe results in a forthcoming paper (Porter et al. in prep).\n5.3\n\nScaling relations produced with the C08\nModel\n\nThe new simplified merger model described above captures\nmuch of the behavior of the C08 model. However, when applied to the SAMs, the results of the two models are not identical. To illustrate the differences, we show the scaling relations produced using the C08 model (Figures 12, 13, and 14).\nAside from using the new, extended model for central dark\nmatter fraction (Appendix A), the model is implemented\nas described in C08. For both SAMs the C08 model results\nin a more pronounced steepening of the size-mass relation.\nIn fact, at low redshift, for S08 the relation produced has\na slope that is too steep, whereas for Millennium the slope\nis close to that observed. Of the three scaling relations, the\nsize-mass relation is the one that shows the largest difference between the two models. However, C08 also produces\na stronger tilt in the FP relation for both SAMs, with both\nSAMs having a tilt that is close to that observed. Though\nwe believe these differences arise from variations in the gas\nfractions and concentrations of the progenitors, we will refrain from a more detailed comparison until the models are\ndirectly implemented within the SAMs.\n\n\fThe Role of Dissipation in the Scaling Relations of Cosmological Merger Remnants\n\n(a)\n\n15\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 9. Faber-Jackson relations for the remnants in the S08 SAM (a) and Millennium SAM (b), binned by redshift. The red line is\nthe observed relation at low redshift (Gallazzi et al. 2006). The S08 SAM produces the correct slope for the FJ relation, whereas the\nMillennium SAM relation is somewhat steeper than observed. Both SAMs also underpredict velocity dispersions for a given mass at z=0,\nthough the problem is much more severe with the Millennium SAM. Both SAMs show evolution in the normalization of the FJ relation\nsince z=3. This is not yet constrained by observations.\n\n6\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nA continuing question in the field of galaxy formation is\nthe role that mergers play in constructing elliptical galaxies. Shen et al. (2003) have suggested that it is difficult to\nget the proper elliptical size-mass relation from repeated\nmajor mergers of disk galaxies because of the rotation between the early- and late-type relations. Recent SAMs confirm this result, and also produce a scatter in the remnant\nsize-mass relation that is much too large (Shankar et al.\n2010; Guo et al. 2010). However, these models do not take\ninto account the effects of dissipation and a possible dependence of gas fraction on progenitor mass, as has been\ndone in several high-resolution hydrodynamical simulations (Dekel & Cox 2006; Robertson et al. 2006;\nHopkins et al. 2008). Here we demonstrate that if the\neffect of dissipation is included within SAMs and if the\nprogenitors have a decreasing gas fraction with increasing\nmass, then this results in a steeper size-mass relation for\nthe merger remnants compared to the disk progenitors.\nFurthermore, since less dense disks have lower star formation rates, the disk galaxy progenitors have increasing gas\nfractions with increasing size at a given mass. Applying a\ndissipative merger model to progenitors with this trend in\ngas fraction also reduces the scatter in the size-mass relation,\n\nas explained at the end of Section 5.1. In fact, our model,\nwith a typical dispersion of 0.2 dex in the size-mass relation, has less than the 0.3-0.4 dex dispersion in the relation\nobserved by Shen et al. (2003). That our dispersion is too\nsmall might be expected, since we are only considering major mergers of disk galaxies, a subset of the total early-type\npopulation. As noted above, we are also separating\nthe size-mass relation according to the redshift of\nthe merger. In order to directly compare to observations, we would need to include all the mergers\nthat have occurred at any given redshift. Comparison\nof the progenitor and remnant properties suggests that the\noverall normalization of the early-type size-mass relation is\ndetermined by a combination of the size-mass relation of\nthe progenitor disk galaxies and the normalization of the\ngas fraction relation.\nIn order to capture the observed Faber-Jackson (FJ)\nrelation, it is necessary to track the changing central dark\nmatter fraction. The results from our model suggest that\nthe FJ relation may evolve modestly over time such that\nearly-type galaxies at a given mass have larger velocity dispersions at higher redshift. The merger model applied to\nprogenitors from the S08 SAM results in a slope close to the\nvirial slope, which is slightly shallower than the observed\nslope. The model applied to progenitors from the Millen-\n\n\f16\n\nCovington et al.\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 10.

The solid red line shows the observed scaling of Mdyn \u221d Mstar\n1+\u03b1\nis a fit to the SAM remnants with Mdyn \u221d Mstar\nand 1 + \u03b1 is shown on the figure. Neither SAM completely captures the observed tilt\nof the FP. S08 produces tilts that are somewhat less than virial, while Millennium is much closer to the observed tilt with 1 + \u03b1 = 1.12\nat z=0.\n\nnium SAM reproduces the observed tilt in the fundamental\nplane (FP), but this agreement appears to be a fortuitous\ncancellation between sizes that are too large and velocity\ndispersions that are too small at a given mass. The tilt predicted by the model is the result of a changing central dark\nmatter fraction with mass that results from a mass dependence of gas fractions in the progenitors. Higher mass progenitors have less gas and therefore less dissipation during\ntheir mergers, resulting in remnants with a less concentrated\nstellar center and consequently a higher dark matter fraction. In the face-on view of the FP, the remnants evolve from\nhigher \u03c3 and lower r at high redshift to lower \u03c3 and higher\nr at low redshift.\nIt is important to note that, since we calculate remnant properties during post-processing, the scaling relations\nderived using the model in this paper do not capture the\nentire elliptical population at each redshift. Rather they depict the scaling relations of elliptical galaxies being added\nto the population via major mergers of disks at a given\nredshift. One would expect that the high-redshift galaxies would undergo further accretion and merging, including\nminor merging and dry merging in some cases (see e.g.\nBezanson et al. 2009; Oser et al. 2010). In particular, minor mergers between a large, gas-poor elliptical and several small spirals have been shown\n\nto greatly increase the effective radius of the elliptical while leaving the velocity dispersion nearly\nunchanged (Naab et al. 2009). Moreover some earlytype galaxies may be formed via mergers involving one or\nmore early-type progenitors, which are also neglected here.\nWe find that approximately one-third of the low-redshift\nspheroids at all masses are accounted for by disk-disk major\nmergers, so it could be misleading to compare our model\noutputs with all observed early-type galaxies at various redshifts.\nWe also note that there are differences between the results of the simple model used here and the previous model\nof C08. Without fully implementing the models within the\nSAMs and tuning the various model parameters, it is difficult to know which model will ultimately produce more\nfavorable results. The simple model requires fewer unknown\nparameters, and therefore is preferred if it produces reasonable results. However, the key conclusions of this work\nare that the steepening and reduced scatter of the sizemass relation from that of disk galaxies, and the tilt\nin the fundamental plane can all be produced by accounting\nfor dissipation during galaxy mergers. While the strength of\nthese effects will vary by model, the effects themselves are\nexpected to be general features of any realistic merger model\nthat accounts for dissipation.\n\n\fThe Role of Dissipation in the Scaling Relations of Cosmological Merger Remnants\n\n(a)\n\n17\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 11. Nearly face-on view of the fundamental plane plotted as r versus \u03c3 for the remnants in the S08 SAM (a) and Millennium\nSAM (b), binned by redshift. Both SAMS show some positive correlation between velocity dispersion and size at all redshifts. From z=3\nto z=0 remnants also gradually migrate from higher dispersion and smaller size to lower dispersion and larger size.\n\nIn future work, it will be useful to a incorporate a dissipational merger model within semi-analytic models. This\nwill allow a more comprehensive exploration of the evolution of galaxy scaling relations via merging by allowing the\ninclusion of a wider variety of progenitor types, and enable\nthe study of correlations with other quantities such as age\nand metallicity. However, even the simple external processing of SAM progenitors as carried out in this study shows\nthat mergers are a viable mechanism for the production of\na large fraction of elliptical galaxies. Furthermore, we find\nthat the elliptical scaling relations are plausibly explained\ngiven the combination of progenitor scaling relations and\ngas fractions.\nAcknowledgments\n\nMC, AD, and JRP acknowledge support from NASA\nATP grant NNX07AG94G and NSF grant 1010033 at\nUCSC.

We\ndefine the dark matter fraction with a given radius as\nfdm =\n\nMdm\n,\n(Mdm + Mstars )\n\n(15)\n\nwhere Mdm and Mstars are the dark matter and stellar\nmasses inside that radius, respectively. For the merger simulations we found that the dark matter fraction inside half\nof the stellar half mass radius could be well-approximated\nby the following formula:\nfdm,f =\n\nMdm,1 + Mdm,2\n.\nMdm,1 + Mdm,2 + Cstars (M1 + M2 + Mnew )\n\n(16)\n\nMdm,1 and Mdm,2 are the dark matter masses inside half of\nthe three-dimensional stellar half-mass radii of the progenitors, M1 and M2 are the total stellar masses of the progenitors, and Mnew is the total mass of stars formed during\nthe merger. This expression simply assumes that the inner\nregion of the remnant contains the same amount of dark\nmatter as the sum of the inner regions of the progenitors,\nand that a fixed fraction, Cstars , of the final stellar mass\nis inside one-half of the three-dimensional stellar half-mass\nradius.\nWhile this formula works well for the simulated remnants, it fails outside the regime where Rprogenitor \u223c\nRremnant . One of the benefits of the formula is that since\nit puts all of the central dark matter from the progenitors\ninto the central portion of the remnant it allows contraction\nof the halo as a result of the baryonic dissipation. However,\nthis contraction is precisely what causes the problem when\nthe initial and final radii differ greatly. Specifically, for high\ngas fraction progenitors with large radii, the remnants can\nhave much smaller radii and the previous formula predicts\nextreme contraction of the dark matter.\nIn order to increase the range of applicability of the\nmerger model, we introduce a simpler, more physically intuitive model for predicting the central dark matter fraction\nthat does not suffer from the deficiencies mentioned above.\nWe begin with the dark matter halo masses and half-mass\n\n21\n\nradii, and assume that the two halos merge dissipationlessly\nso that\n2\n2\nM1,dm\nM2,dm\n(M1,dm + M2,dm )2\n=\n+\n.\nRdm,f\nR1,dm\nR2,dm\n\n(17)\n\nThis equation can be solved for the final halo half-mass radius (Rdm,f ). We use the final radius and mass to fit an\nisothermal profile to the final halo. Then we calculate the\nmass expected inside the stellar half-mass radius and this\nvalue is used to calculate the final central dark matter fraction. For this paper we calculate the dark matter fraction\ninside the stellar half-mass radius and use this to compute\nthe velocity dispersion of the merger remnant. In addition\nto extending the range of validity, this new method removes\none of the least certain parameters from the merger model.\nA check against the merger simulations demonstrates that\nthe new method produces a larger scatter between predicted\nand measured velocity dispersion, with the fractional rms\nscatter increasing from 0.24 to 0.35. However, most of the\nadditional scatter results from variations in orbit, and in this\nwork we find that the distribution of orbits found in N-body\nsimulations is such that orbital variation plays a minor role.\n\n\f"}
