An interesting but generally difficult problem\nEmail addresses: jean-luc.marichal[at]uni.lu (Jean-Luc Marichal),\nivan[at]stat.auckland.ac.nz (Ivan Kojadinovic).\n1 Formerly at LINA CNRS FRE 2729, \u00c9cole Polytechnique de l'Universit\u00e9 de\nNantes, France.\n\nPreprint submitted to Elsevier\n\nSubmitted 18 Jul 06, Accepted 15 Sep 07\n\n\fis to provide explicit expressions for the distribution function and the moments\nof the aggregated random variable Y = h(X).\nThis problem has been completely solved for certain aggregation functions (see\nfor instance [21, \u00a77.2]), especially piecewise linear functions such as weighted\nsums [5] (see also [19]), linear combinations of order statistics [2,20,25] (see\nalso [7, \u00a76.5] for an overview), and lattice polynomials [18], which are max-min\ncombinations of the variables.\nIn this note we solve the case of linear combinations of lattice polynomials,\nwhich include the three above-mentioned cases. Actually, linear combinations\nof lattice polynomials are exactly those continuous functions that reduce to\nlinear functions on each simplex of the standard triangulation of [0, 1]n . In\nparticular, these functions are completely determined by their values at the\n2n vertices of [0, 1]n .\nThe concept of linear combination of lattice polynomials is known in combinatorial optimization and game theory as the Lov\u00e1sz extension [3,13,15,23] of\na pseudo-Boolean function (recall that a pseudo-Boolean function is a realvalued function of 0-1 variables). When it is nondecreasing in each variable, it\nis known in the area of nonlinear aggregation and integration as the discrete\nChoquet integral [10,14,16], which is an extension of the discrete Lebesgue\nintegral (weighted mean) to non-additive measures. The equivalence between\nthe Lov\u00e1sz extension and the Choquet integral is discussed in [16].\nThis note is set out as follows. In Section 2 we elaborate on the definition\nof linear combinations of lattice polynomials and we show how to concisely\nrepresent them. In Section 3 we provide formulas for the distribution function\nand the moments of any linear combination of lattice polynomials from the\nuniform distribution. Finally, in Section 4 we provide an application of our\nresults to aggregation theory.\nThroughout we will use the notation [n] := {1, . . . , n}. Also, for any subset\nA \u2286 [n], 1A will denote the characteristic vector of A in {0, 1}n . Finally, for\nany function h : [0, 1]n \u2192 R, we define the set function vh : 2[n] \u2192 R as\nvh (A) := h(1A ) for all A \u2286 [n].\n\n2\n\nLinear combinations of lattice polynomials\n\nIn the present section we recall the definition of lattice polynomials and we\nshow how an arbitrary combination of lattice polynomials can be represented.\nBasically an n-place lattice polynomial p : [0, 1]n \u2192 [0, 1] is a function defined\n2\n\n\ffrom any well-formed expression involving n real variables x1 , . . . , xn linked\nby the lattice operations \u2227 = min and \u2228 = max in an arbitrary combination\nof parentheses (see e.g. Birkhoff [6, \u00a7II.2]). For instance,\np(x1 , x2 , x3 ) = (x1 \u2227 x2 ) \u2228 x3\nis a 3-place lattice polynomial.\nConsider the standard triangulation of [0, 1]n into the canonical simplices\nS\u03c3 := {x \u2208 [0, 1]n | x\u03c3(1) > * * * > x\u03c3(n) }\n\n(\u03c3 \u2208 Sn ),\n\n(1)\n\nwhere Sn is the set of all permutations on [n]. Clearly, any linear combination\nof n-place lattice polynomials\nh(x) =\n\nm\nX\n\nci pi (x)\n\ni=1\n\nis a continuous function whose restriction to any canonical simplex is a linear\nfunction. According to Singer [23, \u00a72], h is then the Lov\u00e1sz extension of the\npseudo-Boolean function h|{0,1}n , that is, the continuous function defined on\neach canonical simplex S\u03c3 as the unique linear function that coincides with\nh|{0,1}n at the n + 1 vertices\n\u03b5\u03c3i := 1{\u03c3(1),...,\u03c3(i)}\n\n(i = 0, . . . , n)\n\nof S\u03c3 . It can be written as [23, \u00a72]\nh(x) =\n\nn \u0010\nX\n\n\u0011\n\nh\u03c3i \u2212 h\u03c3i\u22121 x\u03c3(i)\n\ni=1\n\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\n\u0010\n\n(x \u2208 S\u03c3 ),\n\n(2)\n\n\u0011\n\nwhere h\u03c3i := h \u03b5\u03c3i = vh {\u03c3(1), . . . , \u03c3(i)} for all i = 0, . . . , n. In particular,\nh\u03c30 = 0.\nConversely any continuous function h : [0, 1]n \u2192 R that reduces to a linear\nfunction on each canonical simplex is a linear combination of lattice polynomials:\nX\n^\nh(x) =\nmh (A)\nxi\n(x \u2208 [0, 1]n ),\n(3)\ni\u2208A\n\nA\u2286[n]\n\nwhere mh : 2[n] \u2192 R is the M\u00f6bius transform of vh , defined as\nmh (A) :=\n\nX\n\n(\u22121)|A|\u2212|B| vh (B).\n\nB\u2286A\n\nIndeed, expression (3) reduces to a linear function on each canonical simplex\nand agrees with h(1B ) at 1B for each B \u2286 [n].\n3\n\n\fEq. (2) thus provides a concise expression for linear combinations of lattice\npolynomials. We will use it in the next section to calculate their distribution\nfunctions and their moments.\nRemark 1 As we have already mentioned, the class of linear combinations\nof lattice polynomials covers three interesting particular cases, namely: lattice\npolynomials, linear combinations of order statistics, and weighted sums. These\nare characterized as follows. Let h : [0, 1]n \u2192 R be a linear combination of\nlattice polynomials.\n(1) The function h reduces to a lattice polynomial if and only if the set function vh is monotone, {0, 1}-valued, and such that vh ([n]) = 1.\n(2) As the order statistics are exactly the symmetric lattice polynomials (see\n[17]), the function h reduces to a linear combination of order statistics\nif and only if the set function vh is cardinality-based, that is, such that\nvh (A) = vh (A\u2032 ) whenever |A| = |A\u2032 |.\n(3) The function h reduces to a weighted sum if and only if the set function\nP\nvh is additive, that is, vh (A) = i\u2208A vh ({i}).\n3\n\nDistribution functions and moments\n\nBefore yielding the main results, let us recall some basic material related to\ndivided differences. See for instance [8,11,22] for further details.\nConsider the plus (resp. minus) truncated power function xn+ (resp. xn\u2212 ), defined to be xn if x > 0 (resp. x < 0) and zero otherwise. Let A(n) be the set of\nn \u2212 1 times differentiable one-place functions g such that g (n\u22121) is absolutely\ncontinuous. The nth divided difference of a function g \u2208 A(n) is the symmetric\nfunction of n + 1 arguments defined inductively by \u2206[g : a0 ] := g(a0) and\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\u2206[g\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\n\n: a1 , . . . , an ] \u2212 \u2206[g : a0 , . . . , an\u22121 ]\n, if a0 6= an ,\nan \u2212 a0\n\n\u2206[g : a0 , . . . , an ] := \uf8f4 \u2202\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\u2206[g : a0 , . . . , an\u22121 ],\n\uf8f3\n\u2202a0\n\nif a0 = an .\n\nThe Peano representation of the divided differences, which can be obtained\nby a Taylor expansion of g, is given by\n\u2206[g : a0 , . . . , an ] =\n\n1\nn!\n\nZ\n\nR\n\ng (n) (t) M(t | a0 , . . . , an ) dt,\n\n(4)\n\nwhere M(t | a0 , . . . , an ) is the B-spline of order n, with knots {a0 , . . . , an },\ndefined as\nn\u22121\nM(t | a0 , . . . , an ) := n \u2206[(* \u2212 t)+\n: a0 , . . . , an ].\n(5)\n4\n\n\fWe also recall the Hermite-Genocchi formula: For any function g \u2208 A(n) , we\nhave\n\u0015\n\u0014\nZ\nn\nX\n(6)\n\u2206[g : a0 , . . . , an ] =\ng (n) a0 + (ai \u2212 ai\u22121 )xi dx,\nSid\n\ni=1\n\nwhere Sid is the simplex defined in (1) when \u03c3 is the identity permutation.\nFor distinct arguments a0 , . . . , an , we also have the following formula, which\ncan be verified by induction,\n\u2206[g : a0 , . . . , an ] =\n\nn\nX\ni=0\n\ng(ai )\n.\nj6=i (ai \u2212 aj )\n\nQ\n\n(7)\n\nNow, consider a random vector X uniformly distributed on [0, 1]n and set\nYh := h(X), where the function h : [0, 1]n \u2192 R is a linear combination of\nlattice polynomials as given in formula (2). We then have the following result.\nTheorem 2 For any function g \u2208 A(n) , we have\nE[g (n) (Yh )] =\n\n\u2206[g : h\u03c30 , . . . , h\u03c3n ].\n\nX\n\n(8)\n\n\u03c3\u2208Sn\n\nProof. Using (2), we simply have\nE[g (n) (Yh )] =\n\nZ\n\n=\n\n[0,1]n\n\ng (n) [h(x)] dx\n\nX Z\n\n\u03c3\u2208Sn\n\ng\nS\u03c3\n\n(n)\n\n\u0014X\nn \u0010\n\nh\u03c3i\n\n\u2212\n\ni=1\n\nh\u03c3i\u22121\n\n\u0011\n\n\u0015\n\nx\u03c3(i) dx.\n\nFinally, after an elementary change of variables, we conclude by the HermiteGenocchi formula (6). \u2737\nTheorem 2 provides the expectation E[g (n)(Yh )] in terms of the divided differences of g with arguments h\u03c30 , . . . , h\u03c3n (\u03c3 \u2208 Sn ). An explicit formula can be\nobtained by (7) whenever the arguments are distinct for every \u03c3 \u2208 Sn .\nClearly, the special cases\ng(x) =\n\nr!\nr!\netx\nxn+r ,\n[x \u2212 E(Yh )]n+r , and n\n(n + r)!\n(n + r)!\nt\n\n(9)\n\ngive, respectively, the raw moments, the central moments, and the momentgenerating function of Yh . As far as the raw moments are concerned, we have\nthe following result.\n5\n\n\fProposition 3 For any integer r > 1, setting A0 := [n], we have,\nE[Yhr ]\n\n=\n\n1\n\u0010\n\nn+r\nr\n\n\u0011\n\nX\n\nA1 \u2286[n]\nA2 \u2286A1\n***\nAr \u2286Ar\u22121\n\nr\nY\n\ni=1\n\n1\n\u0010\n\n|Ai\u22121 |\n|Ai |\n\n\u0011\n\nvh (Ai ).\n\nProof.

For instance, the first two moments are\n\nE[Yh ] =\n\nX\n1\n1\n\u0010 \u0011 vh (A),\nn + 1 A\u2286[n] n\n|A|\n\nX\nX\n1\n2\n1\n\u0010\n\u0011 vh (A1 )\n\u0010\n\u0011 vh (A2 ).\nE[Yh2 ] =\n|A1 |\n(n + 1)(n + 2) A1 \u2286[n] n\nA2 \u2286A1\n|A1 |\n\n|A2 |\n\nWe now yield a formula for the distribution function Fh (y) := Pr[Yh 6 y]\nof Yh .\nTheorem 4 There holds\nFh (y) = 1 \u2212\n\n1 X\n\u2206[(* \u2212 y)n+ : h\u03c30 , . . . , h\u03c3n ].\nn! \u03c3\u2208Sn\n\n(10)\n\nProof. We have\nh\n\ni\n\nFh (y) = 1 \u2212 Pr[h(X) > y] = 1 \u2212 E (Yh \u2212 y)0+ .\nThen, using (8) with\ng(x) =\n\n1\n(x \u2212 y)n+\nn!\n\nleads to the result. \u2737\n\nIt follows from (10) that the distribution function of Yh is absolutely continuous and hence its probability density function is simply given by\nfh (y) =\n\nX\n1\nn\u22121\n\u2206[(* \u2212 y)+\n: h\u03c30 , . . . , h\u03c3n ]\n(n \u2212 1)! \u03c3\u2208Sn\n\n(11)\n\nor, using the B-spline notation (5),\nfh (y) =\n\n1 X\nM(y | h\u03c30 , . . . , h\u03c3n ).\nn! \u03c3\u2208Sn\n\nRemark 5 (i) It is easy to see that (10) can be rewritten by means of the\nminus truncated power function as\nFh (y) =\n\n1 X\n\u2206[(* \u2212 y)n\u2212 : h\u03c30 , . . . , h\u03c3n ].\nn! \u03c3\u2208Sn\n\n7\n\n\f(ii) When the arguments h\u03c30 , . . . , h\u03c3n are distinct for every \u03c3 \u2208 Sn , then combining (7) with (10) immediately yields the following explicit expression\nFh (y) = 1 \u2212\n\nn\n(h\u03c3i \u2212 y)n+\n1 X X\n,\nQ\nn! \u03c3\u2208Sn i=0 j6=i (h\u03c3i \u2212 h\u03c3j )\n\nor, using the minus truncated power function,\nn\n1 X X\n(h\u03c3i \u2212 y)n\u2212\n.\nFh (y) =\nQ\nn! \u03c3\u2208Sn i=0 j6=i (h\u03c3i \u2212 h\u03c3j )\n\n(iii) The knowledge of fh (y) immediately gives an alternative proof of (8).\nIndeed, using Peano's representation (4), we simply have\nE[g (n) (Yh )] =\n=\n=\n\nZ\n\nR\n\ng (n) (y) fh (y) dy\n\n1 X\nn! \u03c3\u2208Sn\nX\n\nZ\n\nR\n\ng (n) (y) M(y | h\u03c30 , . . . , h\u03c3n ) dy\n\n\u2206[g : h\u03c30 , . . . , h\u03c3n ].\n\n\u03c3\u2208Sn\n\n(iv) The case of linear combinations of order statistics is of particular interest.\nIn this case, each h\u03c3i is independent of \u03c3 (see Remark 1), so that we can\nwrite hi := h\u03c3i . The main formulas then reduce to (see for instance [1]\nand [2])\nE[g (n) (Yh )] = n! \u2206[g : h0 , . . . , hn ],\nFh (y) = \u2206[(* \u2212 y)n\u2212 : h0 , . . . , hn ],\nfh (y) = M(y | h0 , . . . , hn ).\nWe also note that the Hermite-Genocchi formula (6) provides nice geometric interpretations of Fh (y) and fh (y) in terms of volumes of slices\nand sections of canonical simplices (see also [4] and [12]).\nBoth functions Fh (y) and fh (y) require the computation of divided differences\nof truncated power functions. On this issue, we recall a recurrence equation,\ndue to de Boor [9] and rediscovered independently by Varsi [24] (see also [4]),\nn\u22121\n: a0 , . . . , an ] in O(n2 ) time.\nwhich allows to compute \u2206[(* \u2212 y)+\nRename as b1 , . . . , br the elements ai such that ai < y and as c1 , . . . , cs the\nelements ai such that ai > y so that r + s = n + 1. Then, the unique solution\nof the recurrence equation\n\u03b1k,l =\n\n(cl \u2212 y)\u03b1k\u22121,l + (y \u2212 bk )\u03b1k,l\u22121\ncl \u2212 bk\n8\n\n(k 6 r, l 6 s),\n\n(12)\n\n\fwith initial values \u03b11,1 = (c1 \u2212 b1 )\u22121 and \u03b10,l = \u03b1k,0 = 0 for all l, k > 2, is\ngiven by\n\u03b1k,l := \u2206[(* \u2212 y)k+l\u22122\n: b1 , . . . , bk , c1 , . . . , cl ]\n+\n\n(k + l > 2).\n\nn\u22121\nIn order to compute \u2206[(* \u2212 y)+\n: a0 , . . . , an ] = \u03b1r,s , it suffices therefore to\ncompute the sequence \u03b1k,l for k + l > 2, k 6 r, l 6 s, by means of two nested\nloops, one on k, the other on l.\n\nWe can compute \u2206[(* \u2212 y)n\u2212 : a0 , . . . , an ] similarly. Indeed, the same recurrence\nequation applied to the initial values \u03b10,l = 0 for all l > 1 and \u03b1k,0 = 1 for all\nk > 1, produces the solution\n\u03b1k,l := \u2206[(* \u2212 y)k+l\u22121\n: b1 , . . . , bk , c1 , . . . , cl ]\n\u2212\n\n(k + l > 1).\n\nSee for instance [4] and [24] for further details.\n\n4\n\nApplication to aggregation theory\n\nAs we have already mentioned, the concept of linear combination of lattice\npolynomials, when it is nondecreasing in each variable, is known in aggregation theory as the discrete Choquet integral, which is extensively used in nonadditive expected utility theory, cooperative game theory, complexity analysis,\nmeasure theory, etc. (see [14] for an overview.) For instance, when a discrete\nChoquet integral is used as an aggregation tool in a given decision making\nproblem, it is then very informative for the decision maker to know its distribution. In that context, the most natural a priori density on [0, 1]n is the\nuniform one, which makes the results derived here of particular interest.\nExample 6 Let h : [0, 1]3 \u2192 R be a discrete Choquet integral defined by\nvh ({1}) = 0.1, vh ({2}) = 0.6, vh ({3}) = vh ({1, 2}) = vh ({1, 3}) = vh ({2, 3}) =\n0.9, and vh ({1, 2, 3}) = 1. According to (3), it can be written as\nh(x) = 0.1 x1 + 0.6 x2 + 0.9 x3\n+ 0.2(x1 \u2227 x2 ) \u2212 0.1(x1 \u2227 x3 ) \u2212 0.6(x2 \u2227 x3 )\n\u2212 0.1(x1 \u2227 x2 \u2227 x3 ).\nIts density, which can be computed through (11) and the recurrence equation (12), is represented in Figure 1 by the solid line. The dotted line represents\nthe density estimated by the kernel method from 10 000 randomly generated\nrealizations. The typical value and standard deviation can also be calculated\nthrough the raw moments: we have\nE[Yh ] \u2248 0.608 and\n\nq\n\nE[Yh2 ] \u2212 E[Yh ]2 \u2248 0.204.\n\n9\n\n\fFig. 1.
