This process\nis generally indicated as the nurture of galaxies. Evidence in support of it comes\nfrom various directions. The asymmetric shape of stellar disks (Zaritsky 1995\nand Zaritsky & Rix 1997) and the morphological and kinematic lopsidedness\nobserved in the H I density distributions and velocity fields of spirals (Verheijen\n1997, Swaters et al. 1999) may have originated from recent minor mergers.\nFurthermore, there is an increasingly large number of galaxies which in H I show\neither peculiar features or clear signs of interactions with small companions\n(Sancisi 1999a and b). This indicates that galaxies often are in an environment\nwhere material for accretion is available.\nCold extra-planar gas has been found in several spiral galaxies. The best\nexamples are those of NGC 891, NGC 2403 and UGC 7321 (cf. Oosterloo et\nal., Fraternali et al., Matthews, this volume). The origin of this gas is not\nknown. It has been suggested that it may, at least partly, be the product of\ngalactic fountains. But some of its structural properties suggest that it may\nhave originated from minor mergers.\nRecently, clear evidence that accretion events play an important role has\ncome from studies of the distribution and kinematics of stars in the Milky Way\nhalo. The discovery of the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy (Ibata et al. 1994) is re1\n\n\f2\n\nvan der Hulst & Sancisi\n\ngarded as proof that accretion is still taking place at the present time. Since\nsuch minor merger remnants retain information about their origin for a long\ntime (Helmi & White 2000) studies of the distribution and kinematics of \"stellar streams\" can in principle be used to trace the merger history of the Milky\nWay (Helmi & de Zeeuw 2001). Such \"stellar streams\" are not only seen in the\nMilky Way, but have also been discovered in the Local Group galaxy M 31 (Ibata\net al. 2001, Ferguson et al. 2002, McConnachie et al. 2003). The substructure\nin the halo of M 31 is another piece of clear evidence that minor mergers still\ntake place.\nSuch events are difficult to trace in more distant galaxies, where we can not\nobserve individual stars. Other means are needed for detecting the signature\nof accretion. In this respect, the use of H I is very powerful as it can image\ninteractions very effectively by studying the H I distributions and kinematics.\nThe latter is particularly useful for modelling. Examples can be found in Sancisi\n(1999a). The improved sensitivity of modern synthesis radio telescopes brings\nwithin reach the detection of faint H I signatures of accretion events and we\nexpect that new observations of nearby and also more distant galaxies will reveal\nthese in the coming decade. To further illustrate this point we here present a\nfew examples of such signatures: NGC 3359, NGC 4565 and NGC 6946.\n\nFigure 1. The left panel shows the distribution of NGC 3359 at a resolution\nof 30\u2032\u2032 superposed on the digital sky survey image. Contours are 0.1, 0.2, 0.4,\n0.8, 1.6, 3.0, and 5.0 \u00d71021 cm\u22122 . The right panel shows outer contours of\nthe H I emission in individual channels superposed on the total H I emission\nin NGC 3359. The low velocities are dark grey, the high velocities light grey.\n\n\fgas accretion\n2.\n\n3\n\nThe observations\n\nAll three galaxies have been observed recently with the Westerbork Synthesis\nRadio Telescope (WSRT) using the new front-end and correlator providing a\nmuch improved sensitivity. We will discuss each case individually below. Details\nof the observations and some of these results have already been reported by van\nder Hulst & Sancisi (2004).\n2.1.\n\nNGC 3359\n\nNGC 3359 is a nearby barred spiral galaxy (Hubble type SBc) which has been\nobserved in H I by Broeils (1992) as part of a study of the mass distribution of a\nsample of nearby spiral galaxies. It has a total mass of 1.2 \u00d7 1011 M\u2299 and an H I\nmass of 7.5\u00d7109 M\u2299 (Broeils & Rhee, 1997, adjusted for a Hubble constant of 72\nkm/s/Mpc). It has well developed spiral structure both in the optical and in H I.\nKamphuis & Sancisi (1994, see also Sancisi 1999a) pointed out the presence of\nan H I companion which appears distorted and has a long tail which may connect\nto the H I disk of NGC 3359. This observation already indicated the possible\naccretion of gas by a large galaxy. Our new, more sensitive observations (rms\nnoise of 0.85 mJy/beam for velocity and spatial resolutions of 10 km s\u22121 and 30\u2032\u2032\nrespectively) are shown in Figure 1 (left panel) and convincingly display an H I\nconnection between the distorted H I companion and the main galaxy. The mass\nof the H I companion is 1.8 \u00d7 108 M\u2299 or 2.4% of the H I mass of NGC 3359. The\nH I distribution of the companion is clearly distorted and shows a tail pointing\ntowards and connecting with the outer spiral structure of NGC 3359. No clear\noptical counterpart of the H I companion has yet been found.\nThe velocity structure of the H I companion and the connecting H I fits in\nvery well with the regular velocity field of NGC 3359. This is shown in the\nright panel of Figure 1 where we display the emission in the individual channels\nsuperposed on the total H I image of NGC 3359. Contours of different shades\nof grey (low velocities are dark, high velocities are light) denote the outer edge\nof the H I emission in each of the velocity channels and thus display the basic\nkinematics of the H I without any further analysis of individual velocity profiles.\nThe regularity of the velocities suggests that the process has been going on\nslowly for at least one rotational period which is of the order of 1.7 Gy.\n2.2.\n\nNGC 4565\n\nNGC 4565 is a large edge-on galaxy of Hubble type Sb which was first observed\nin H I by Sancisi (1976) in an early search for galaxies with warped H I disks.\nRupen (1991) observed NGC 4565 with much higher resolution and presented a\ndetailed study of the kinematics and the warp. NGC 4565 has a small optical\ncompanion 6\u2032 to the north of the center, F378-0021557, which has 7.4 \u00d7 107 M\u2299\nof H I compared to an H I mass of 2.0 \u00d7 1010 M\u2299 for NGC 4565 (using a distance\nof 17 Mpc). An H I detection of this companion called NGC 4565A has also been\nreported by Rupen (1991). Another H I companion, NGC 4562, somewhat larger\nin H I (2.5 \u00d7 108 M\u2299 ) and brighter optically can be found 15\u2032 to the south-west\nof the center of NGC 4565. The H I distribution, derived from a new sensitive\nWSRT observation by Dahlem (priv. comm.), is shown in Figure 2 superposed\non the DSS. The asymmetric warp is clearly visible.\n\n\f4\n\nvan der Hulst & Sancisi\n\nFigure 2.\nH I distribution of NGC 4565 at a resolution of 30\u2032\u2032 superposed\non the digital sky survey image. Contours are 0.2, 0.4, 0,8, 1.6, 3.2, and 6.4\n\u00d71021 cm\u22122 .\n\nInspection of individual channel maps brings to light that in addition to the\nwarp the H I distribution shows additional, low surface brightness emission to the\nnorth of the center, in the direction of the faint companion F378-0021557. The\nH I emission in the velocity range from 1250 to 1290 km s\u22121 (close to the velocity\nof F378-0021557 and to the systemic velocity, 1230 km s\u22121 , of NGC 4565) clearly\nshows distortions above the plane pointing towards the companion. This is best\nseen in Figure 3 which shows four channel maps chosen at velocities in this range.\nIn these maps one can clearly see the H I layer bending towards F378-0021557,\nindicating a connection between F378-0021557 and a strong disturbance in the\nH I disk of NGC 4565. This disturbance is not associated with the warp. However, this bending of the H I layer, undoubtedly caused by the companion, is\nremarkably similar tot the outer H I warping. One wonders whether the type\nof interaction we are witnessing here is the mechanism also responsible for the\ncreation of a warp. This interaction between NGC 4565 and its companion will\neventually lead to a merger of the latter with NGC 4565.\nTo further elucidate the connection between F378-0021557 and NGC 4565\nwe show a position-velocity diagram along the H I connection in figure 4. This\nposition-velocity cut has been taken parallel to the minor axis of NGC 4565\n\n\fgas accretion\n\n5\n\nFigure 3. H I emission at four velocities between 1256 and 1287 km s\u22121\nsuperposed on the DSS image of NGC 4565 at a resolution of 13\u2032\u2032 \u00d733\u2032\u2032 . These\nchannels clearly show the interaction between the companion and NGC 4565.\nContours are -2.0 -1.0 1.0 2.0 4.0 8.0 160. 32 0. 64.0 120.0 mJy/beam\n\nthrough F378-0021557 and clearly shows the velocity continuity of the H I disturbance in the disk of NGC 4565 and F378-0021557.\n2.3.\n\nNGC 6946\n\nNGC 6946 is a bright, nearby spiral galaxy of Hubble type Scd which has been\nstudied in H I numerous times (Rogstad et al. 1973, Tacconi & Young 1986,\nKamphuis 1993). It was in this galaxy that Kamphuis and Sancisi (1993) found\nthe first evidence for an anomalous velocity H I component which they associated\nwith outflow of gas from the disk into the halo as a result of stellar winds and\nsupernova explosions. Evidence for such a component is now being found in more\ngalaxies as discussed by Fraternali et al. (2001, 2002, and also this volume). A\n\n\f6\n\nvan der Hulst & Sancisi\n\nFigure 4. Position velocity diagram parallel to the minor axis of NGC 4565\nacross F378-0021557 and the disk of NGC 4565.\n\ndetailed study of the anomalous H I and the structure in the H I disk is being\ncarried out by Boomsma et al. (this volume) on the basis of very sensitive\nobservations with the WSRT (rms of 0.5 mJy/beam for spatial and velocity\nresolutions of 60\u2032\u2032 and 5 km s\u22121 respectively).\nHere we use a low resolution (60\u2032\u2032 ) version of these data. Figure 6 shows a\ntotal H I image of NGC 6946 down to column density levels of 1.3 \u00d7 1019 cm\u22122 .\nTo the west two small companion galaxies can be seen. The most intruiging\nfeature is the faint whisp to the north-west of the H I disk of NGC 6946. This\nfaint H I extension can only be brought out at this resolution and appears to form\na faint H I filament which blends smoothly (also kinematically) with the H I disk\nof NGC 6946 at a position some 11\u2032 (or 19 kpc) south of the tip of the filament.\nThere is no detected connection with the two companion galaxies farther to the\nwest. The spatial and velocity structure of the object are so regular, yet only\n\n\fgas accretion\n\n7\n\nFigure 5. H I distribution in NGC 6946 at a resolution of 30\u2032\u2032 (greyscale)\nand 60\u2032\u2032 (contours, see also Boomsma et al. this volume). Contours are 1.3,\n2.6, 5.2, 10.4, and 20.8 \u00d71019 cm\u22122 .\n\nconnected to the main H I disk at one side that we prefer an explanation in terms\nof a tidally stretched, infalling H I object. So this looks like yet another example\nof accretion of small amounts of gas onto a large H I disk.\nSimilar examples are perhaps the filament discovered in NGC 2403 (Fraternali et al. 2001, 2002 and also this volume), a long H I filament in M 33 (van\nder Hulst, unpublished) and the extra-planar filaments in the northern part of\nthe H I halo of NGC 891 (Fraternali et al., this volume).\n\n3.\n\nConcluding remarks\n\nWe have shown three cases with strong evidence for the accretion of small\namounts of H I. These are certainly not unique. There are several more cases\nknown (Sancisi 1999a and b). Furthermore, there are cases with such faint features that can only be seen in sensitive H I observations as the H I masses involved\nare rather modest. We therefore expect that with the increased sensitivity of\nmodern synthesis radio telescopes, more examples will be discovered in the coming decade. There probably is a range of H I masses for these accretion events\nas is already apparent from the six cases mentioned here: NGC 891, NGC 2403,\nNGC 3359, NGC 4565, NGC 6946 and M 33.\nWhat is the effect of accretion on the main galaxy? This can influence local\nstar formation in the disks and starbursts. For instance, there may very well\nbe a connection with the star formation activity in the disks of galaxies such\n\n\f8\n\nvan der Hulst & Sancisi\n\nas NGC 6946 and NGC 2403. The infall of gas may be at the origin of the\nextra-planar gas and gaseous halos recently discovered in spiral galaxies. Also,\nit may affect the structure of galactic disks in the outer parts and possibly also\ncontribute to the formation of the outer layers and of warps in particular.\nIt is quite clear that future sensitive and detailed studies of the H I in nearby\ngalaxies will provide a more complete census of the phenomena discussed in this\npaper and enable us to address these issues further and obtain more definitive\nanswers. In particular, it should be possible to obtain estimates of the mean gas\naccretion rate in galaxies.\nReferences\nBroeils, A. H., 1992, PhD thesis, University of Groningen\nBroeils, A.
