Among them the\nmost remarkable property is that such materials have a\nresidual entropy whose value is almost the same as that\nobtained by Pauling1) for proton configurations in the\nordinary hexagonal ice Ih . This indicates the existence\nof the 'ice rule' in these magnetic materials2) due to spin\nfrustrations. The difference of 'spin ice' from the real\nice is that we can resolve the degeneracy by applying an\ninfinitesimal magnetic field. One of our interests then is\nhow the spins behave in response to magnetic fields. The\nspin ice system has a spin lattice forming the pyrochlore\nstructure as depicted in Fig. 1(a). In the pyrochlore lattice the spin sites construct a three dimensional network\nof corner-sharing tetrahedra with cubic symmetry. Each\nsite belongs to two tetrahedra and the spin is forced\nto point toward either of these centers by strong crystal field anisotropy. Due to this Ising-like property the\nspin system becomes fully-frustrated on the pyrochrore\nlattice if the neighboring spins are likely to align ferromagnetically because the direction-cosine between their\neasy-axes is negative. In this case the lowest energy of\nfour-spin state on a tetrahedron is given by the configurations where two spins point \"in\" and the other two\nspins \"out\", and it is six-fold degenerated (see Fig. 1(c)).\nThis rule applied in the ground state is the same as that\nfor the proton configuration in the ordinary hexagonal\nice Ih , and is therefore called the ice rule. The ice rule\nmakes the number of low-lying states of the whole system\nenormous as long as the long range spin-spin interactions\nare very weak. In particular the ground state is macroscopically degenerated when only the nearest neighbor\ninteraction is concerned. Pauling is the first one who\n\n\u2217\n\nE-mail: shun1@statphys.sci.hokudai.ac.jp\n\nestimated the value of the residual entropy to obtain\nS0\n1\n3\n=\nln\n\u2243 0.203,\nN kB\n2\n2\n\n(1.1)\n\nwhere N is the number of protons in the ice Ih . Although his original interest was the entropy due to the\nproton configurations in the ordinary hexagonal ice Ih ,\nthe value obtained is the same for the pyrochlore lattice\nsince the network topology of tetrahedra is ignored in his\nestimation. It turned out that the difference between the\nstructure of tetrahedra in the pyrochlore and Ih lattices\nis not so relevant because the correction to the Pauling\nvalue is very small.3) This is the reason why the Pauling\nvalue is a good approximate one for both systems. Indeed the specific heat for spin ice systems was measured\nby experiments and by Monte Carlo simulations,4) from\nwhich the residual entropy is evaluated and agrees with\n(1.1). A mean field approximation (MFA) may be the\nfirst step to examine thermodynamic properties and has\nbeen so far applied to the spin ice system to analyze neutron scattering experiments.5)6) The simplest MFA is the\none using the 4-sublattice magnetizations and neglecting\nspin correlations. Such a treatment, however, results in\na phase transition at a finite temperature, below which a\nlong range order appears and brings about the vanishing\nof the entropy as T \u2192 0.5) This discrepancy from those\nof experiments and Monte Carlo simulation is due to the\nfact that the MFA cannot deal with the spin fluctuations\nand \"two-in and two-out\" spin behaviors in tetrahedra,\ni.e., the ice rule.\nOn the other hand, Slater studied a hydrogen bonded\ncrystal KH2 PO4 (KDP)7) with the ice rule. In this crystal the ice rule is described by that (i) one proton exists\non each O-O bond between two nearest neighboring PO4\ntetrahedra and (ii) each tetrahedron has exactly two protons ajacent to it. He succeded in explaining the phase\ntransition of KDP by coping with the ice rule. His approximate treatment is tantamount to an extended Bethe\napproximation. It is equivalent to the tetrahedral cactus\napproximation in the cluster variation method (CVM),\n\n\f2\n\nShun-ichi Yoshida , Koji Nemoto , Koh Wada\n\nwhich was developed to improve the MFA systematically\nby taking into account higher order correlations.8) The\ntetrahedral cactus approximation in the CVM was successfully applied to analyze the wave-number dependent\nferro-electric susceptibility above and below the transition temperature for the KDP crystal.9)\nIn the present paper, we apply the tetrahedral cactus approximation in the CVM to the spin ice system\nwith nearest-neighbor ferromagnetic coupling. Within\nthe present approximation we show that no magnetic\nphase transition takes place by investigating analytically\nobtained eigenvalues appearing in the wave-number dependent susceptibility. As a result the Pauling value for\nthe residual entropy is reproduced in the zero temperature limit. Furthermore we evaluate the neutron scattering intensity, which is qualitatively in good agreement\nwith that obtained by Monte Carlo simulations and experiments.\nThe present manuscript is organized as follows: In \u00a72\nwe present the CVM formulation for the spin ice system\nwith nearest neighbor ferromagnetic coupling to derive\na set of linear response equations to an inhomogeneous\nmagnetic field. In \u00a73 described are the main results including the temperature dependency of the entropy and\nof the specific heat, the wave-number dependent susceptibility and the neutron scattering pattern. Section 4\nis devoted to a summary of this manuscript with some\ndiscussions on the relation between the present approximation and the usual mean field approximation.\n\u00a72.\n\nFormulation of Nearest Neighbor Spin Ice\nSystem\n\n2.1 Indexing Site Locations\nThe pyrochlore lattice is a non-Bravias lattice. In a\nrhombohedral chemical unit cell located at a translational lattice site R there exist four independent spins\nsituated on a tetrahedron whose position vectors are denoted by r \u03bd relative to R. Thus there are four sublattices\nfor spin configurations in the pyrochlore lattice. For N/4\nrhombohedral chemical unit cells the translational lattice\nvector R is chosen in the center of each unit cell. The\n\u03bd-th position vector in the unit cell is taken, respectively,\nas\n\uf8eb \uf8f6\n\uf8eb \uf8f6\n0\n0\na \uf8ed \uf8f8\na \uf8ed \uf8f8\n0 , r2 =\n1 ,\nr1 =\n4\n4\n0\n1\n(2.1)\n\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8f6\n1\na \uf8ed \uf8f8\n0 ,\nr3 =\n4\n1\n\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8f6\n1\na \uf8ed \uf8f8\n1 ,\nr4 =\n4\n0\n\nwhere a is the linear size of the cubic primitive cell (see\nFig.1(a)). For later notational convenience we sometimes\nuse the sequential numbering i-th site (i = 1, * * * , N ) for\na spin site R + r\u03bd .\n2.2 Spin Hamiltonian\nThe Hamiltonian of the spin ice system with N\nspins under an inhomogeneous external field H i (i =\n\n(a)\n\na\n\nz\ny\nx\n(b)\n\n2\n\n3\n4\nz\n\n1\ny\n\nx\n\n(c)\n\n2 Jeff\n0\n2\n3\n\nJeff\n\nFig. 1. (a) A schematic plot of the pyrochlore lattice. The magnetic ions are located at each vertex of the tetrahedra. The\noutlines of the rhombohedral chemical unit-cell and the cubic\nunit-cell are also shown. There are four independent spins and\ntwo tetrahedra in a rhombohedral chemical unit-cell. (b) Local\nIsing axes n\u03bd (\u03bd = 1, 2, 3, 4) (c) Energy levels of spin configurations in one tetrahedron.\n\n1, * * * , N ) is given as\nH(S 1 , * * * , S N )\nX\nX\nX\nH i * Si\nSi * Sj \u2212\n(n\u03bd(i) * S i )2 \u2212 J\n= \u2212Da\ni\n\n3\n+Drnn\n\nX \u0014 Si * Sj\nhiji\n\n|rij |3\n\ni\nhiji\n\u0015\n3(S i * rij )(S j * r ij )\n, (2.2)\n\u2212\n|r ij |5\n\nwhere S i is a spin vector at the i-th site (|S i | = 1), r ij\nthe displacement vector from the j-th to the i-th site,\nand rnn is the distance between nearest neighboring two\nspins. The second term represents the nearest-neighbor\nferromagnetic exchange interactions (J > 0). The third\nand the last terms are the Zeeman energy and the dipolar\ninteractions, respectively. The first term, which repre-\n\n\fApplication of the CVM to Spin Ice Systems\n\nsents the single-ion anisotropy(Da > 0), is the most crucial one in the spin ice system because this term makes\nthe system obey the ice rule. There are four distinct local easy-axis directions denoted by n\u03bd(i) , where \u03bd denotes\nthe sublattice where the i-th spin belongs. As shown in\nFig. 1(b) we take the unit vector n\u03bd directing the local\nIsing axis of the \u03bd-th sublattice as\n\uf8eb \uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n1\n1\n1\n1\nn1 = \u221a \uf8ed 1 \uf8f8 , n2 = \u221a \uf8ed \u22121 \uf8f8 ,\n3\n3\n1\n\u22121\n(2.3)\n\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\u22121\n1\nn3 = \u221a \uf8ed 1 \uf8f8 ,\n3\n\u22121\n\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\u22121\n1\nn4 = \u221a \uf8ed \u22121 \uf8f8 .\n3\n1\n\nNow we introduce two assumptions to make the model\na little simpler. First we consider the case where the\ndipole interactions are so weak (D \u226a J) that they are\nnegligible except the nearest-neighbor one, although one\nhas to cope with the effect of D when expecting that\nthe system falls into the unique ground state in very\nlow temperatures. Second the single-ion anisotropy is so\nstrong (Da \u226b J) that the spins are forced to align along\ntheir uniaxial directions.

Then the variational free energy of the\nsystem F is given by\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u03b2F = Tr \u03b2H(\u03c31 , * * * , \u03c3N )Ptot (\u03c31 , * * * , \u03c3N )\n(2.10)\n\u0002\n\u0003\n+Tr Ptot (\u03c31 , * * * , \u03c3N ) ln Ptot (\u03c31 , * * * , \u03c3N ) ,\n\nwhere \u03b2 = 1/kB T .\nThe equilibrium probability is obtained by minimizing F with respect to\nPtot (\u03c31 , * * * , \u03c3N ). Then systematic approximations to\nPtot correspond to those to the free energy one by one.\nFor example the 'point' approximation\nY (i)\n(2.11)\nP1 (\u03c3i ),\nPtot (\u03c31 , * * * , \u03c3N ) \u2243\ni\n\ncorresponds to the usual mean field approximation where\n(i)\nP1 (\u03c3i ) denotes the single spin probability. In the\npresent work we adopt the tetrahedral 'cactus' approximation, whose approximant is written as\nPtot (\u03c31 , * * * , \u03c3N )\n\u2243\n\n(2.12)\n\n(ijkl)\nY\nY (i)\nP4\n(\u03c3i , \u03c3j , \u03c3k , \u03c3l )\nP1 (\u03c3i )\n(i)\n(j)\n(k)\n(l)\ni\nhijkli P1 (\u03c3i )P1 (\u03c3j )P1 (\u03c3k )P1 (\u03c3l )\n\n,\n\n(ijkl)\n\nwhere the probability for the four spins P4\n(\u03c3i , \u03c3j , \u03c3k , \u03c3l )\nis introduced to take into account two spins 'in' and two\nspins 'out' correlation on a tetrahedron.

Numerical evaluation of the neutron scattering pattern with\nf (Q) = 1 is shown in Fig.4. As temperature becomes\n\nhigher, the calculated pattern becomes vaguer due to\nthe fluctuation. Although almost the same scattering\npattern is obtained from the MFA in the paramagnetic\nphase, the tetrahedral cactus approximation in the CVM\nshows vaguer pattern than the MFA does at the same\ntemperature. This difference is due to the fluctuation\ncaused by the four spin correlation which the tetrahedral cactus approximation in the CVM can take into account. The scattering pattern agrees qualitatively with\nthe results of Monte Carlo simulation on the basis of the\nnearest neighbor spin ice model.10)\n\u00a74.\n\nSummary and Discussion\n\nWe have applied the tetrahedral cactus approximation\nin the CVM to the spin ice system with nearest neighbor interactions. The temperature dependence of the\nentropy and the specific heat shows qualitatively good\nagreement with those observed by Monte Carlo simulations and experiments, and the Pauling value is reproduced for the residual entropy. We have obtained\nthe analytic expression of the q-dependent magnetic susceptibility and confirmed the absence of magnetic phase\ntransition. Furthermore we have evaluated the neutron\nscattering pattern, which is also consistent with that obtained from Monte Carlo simulations.\nThe crucial point which differentiates the present results from those of the MFA is that the tetrahedral cactus approximation can take into account the ice rule in\nan appropriate manner. It is because that the four-spin\ncorrelation between the spins on a tetrahedron plays an\nimportant role for the ice rule of spin ice system in low\ntemperatures. To depict this situation let us explain\nbriefly what results in the point approximation of the\nCVM, which corresponds to the MFA. The approximant\nPtot is given by eq.(2.11) and the same procedure as in\nthe previous sections leads to the \u039b-matrix (3.6) with\nthe following parameters replaced by\n\u039bdiag =\n\n1\n,\n2\n\n\u039boff =\n\nJeff\n.\n3kB T\n\n(4.1)\n\nThe rest of the story, including eqs.(3.13) - (3.15), is\nalso valid for the point approximation and we thus ob-\n\n\f4\n3\n\n( 0, 0, l )\n\n2\n1\n0\n-1\n-2\n\n1/\u03c7 (1)\nq\n\nShun-ichi Yoshida , Koji Nemoto , Koh Wada\n\n3.5\n\nInverse Susceptibility\n\n6\n\n2.5\n\n3\n\n2\n1.5\n1\n0.5\n0\n1\n\n0\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\nTemperature k BT/ J\n\n-3\n-4\n-3\n\n-2\n\n-1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n3\n\n(1)\n\nFig. 5.

Below Tc the long range order appears and prevents the\nsystem from having the expecting residual entropy. Obviously this result is not suitable for the behavior of the\npresent model at low temperatures where the ice rule\ndominates.\nRecently dipolar spin ice systems have been found to\nshow a remarkable aspect. It has been suggested that in\nthe spin ice materials such as Dy2 Ti2 O7 and Ho2 Ti2 O7\nthe long range dipolar interaction is responsible for spin\nice behaviors. It would be then expected that the macroscopic degeneracy of the ground state is removed by the\ndipolar interaction and the long range order exists at\nvery low temperature. The existence of ordered phase is\nalso indicated by the Monte Carlo simulation by Melko et\nal.11) On the other hand, such a phase has not been found\nin the real spin ice materials Dy2 Ti2 O7 and Ho2 Ti2 O7 .10)\nThis may happen if with the temperature being decreased the free energy barriers separating the ordered\nstate from quasi-degenerate states grow very high and\nconsequently the relaxation time to the ordered phase\nbecomes very large. In order to elucidate the ordered\nphase of the dipolar spin ice more in detail, we have to\ncope with the long range dipolar interactions neglected\nin the present work. The application of the cactus approximation to the dipolar spin ice is in progress and will\nbe presented elsewhere in the near future.\n\u00a75.\n\nFig. 4.
