Using FUSE observations we have now detected nebular\nO VI emission from NGC 6543. Its central star, with an effective temperature of \u223c50,000 K, is too\ncool to photoionize O V, so the O VI ions must have been produced by thermal collisions at the\ninterface between the hot interior gas and the cool nebular shell. We modeled the O VI emission\nincorporating thermal conduction, but find that simplistic assumptions for the AGB and fast wind\nmass loss rates overproduce X-ray emission and O VI emission. We have therefore adopted the pressure\nof the interior hot gas for the interface layer and find that expected O VI emission to be comparable\nto the observations.\nSubject headings: conduction - planetary nebulae: individual (NGC 6543) - ultraviolet: ISM\n1. INTRODUCTION\n\nPlanetary nebulae (PNe) are formed through dynamic\ninteractions between the current fast stellar wind and\nprevious asymptotic giant branch (AGB) wind (Kwok\n1983; Frank, Balick, & Riley 1990); thus, the interior of\na PN is filled with shocked fast wind. This hot interior\ngas and the cool nebular shell form a contact discontinuity where heat conduction (Spitzer 1962) is expected\nto occur. The resulting mass evaporation from the dense\nnebular shell into the hot interior lowers the temperature and raises the density of the hot gas (Weaver et al.\n1977), significantly increasing the X-ray emissivity. Hydrodynamic models of PNe with heat conduction predict X-ray emission that should be easily detectable with\nmodern X-ray observatories (Zhekov & Perinotto 1996).\nChandra and XMM-Newton have indeed detected diffuse X-ray emission from PNe, with plasma temperatures of 1 \u2212 3 \u00d7 106 K and X-ray luminosities of\nLX = 3 \u2212 100 \u00d7 1031 erg s\u22121 (Guerrero, Chu, & Gruendl\n2004). The limb-brightened X-ray morphology and\nthe low plasma temperatures are qualitatively consistent with the predictions of models with heat conduction; however, the observed LX are generally too low.\nFor example, the observed LX of NGC 6543, 1 \u00d7 1032\nergs s\u22121 (Chu et al. 2001), is an order of magnitude\nlower than that modeled by Zhekov & Perinotto (1998).\nSimilar discrepancies between observed and modeled LX\nhave been seen in Wolf-Rayet bubbles (e.g., NGC 6888,\nGarc\u0131\u0301a-Segura, Langer, & Mac Low 1996) and superbubbles (e.g., M17, Dunne et al. 2003), suggesting that\n\u2217 BASED\n\nON OBSERVATIONS MADE WITH THE NASACNES-CSA FAR ULTRAVIOLET SPECTROSCOPIC EXPLORER. FUSE IS OPERATED FOR NASA BY THE JOHNS\nHOPKINS UNIVERSITY UNDER NASA CONTRACT NAS 532985.\nElectronic address: gruendl@astro.uiuc.edu, chu@astro.uiuc.edu\nElectronic address: mar@iaa.es\n\nthis problem may be associated with thermal conduction\nper se.\nThermal conduction has been assumed in theoretical\nmodels but not constrained empirically through observation because interfaces at a few \u00d7105 K require difficult UV observations. Traditionally interfaces have been\nstudied using spectral lines of C IV, N V, and O VI;\nhowever, these species can be photoionized by hot stars\n(especially PN central stars with effective temperatures\n>100,000 K) and the detection of these narrow absorption lines can be hampered by the stellar P Cygni profile\nand confused by interstellar absorption lines.\nWe have chosen to study the interface layer in the\nPN NGC 6543 using O VI emission because the physical properties of its interior hot gas have been established by Chandra observations (Chu et al. 2001) and its\ncentral star is too cool to produce O VI by photoionization (Teff \u223c 50, 000 K, Zweigle et al. 1997). Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer (FUSE) observations of\nNGC 6543 have been made and O VI emission is indeed\ndetected. In this paper we describe the observations and\ndata processing in \u00a72, present the results in \u00a73, and discuss their implications in \u00a74.\n2. FUSE OBSERVATIONS AND REDUCTION\n\nWe have observed NGC 6543 with FUSE to search\nfor nebular O VI emission. The FUSE observatory\nhas four spectrographs operating simultaneously to cover\nthe 905\u20131187 \u00c5 wavelength range with high resolution,\n\u03bb/\u03b4\u03bb \u224320,000. Details of the design and performance\nof the FUSE spectrographs are described by Moos et al.\n(2000) and Sahnow et al. (2000).\nThree observations of NGC 6543 were obtained in the\ntime-tag mode using the HIRS aperture (1.\u2032\u2032 25\u00d720\u2032\u2032): \"NCav\" samples the northern edge of the central cavity, \"NExt\" the northern extension of the cavity, and \"OFF\" a\nregion outside the nebula at 150\u2032\u2032 north of the central star\n\n\f2\n\nGruendl et al.\n\nFig. 1.- Hubble Space Telescope H\u03b1 image superposed with\nX-ray contours extracted from a smoothed Chandra ACIS-S image\nof NGC 6543 (Chu et al. 2001). The approximate location of the\nFUSE HIRS apertures are marked by rectangles.\n\n(see Fig. 1 for their locations). Additional observations\nof the central star, available in the archive and referred\nto as CS, used the MDRS aperture (4\u2032\u2032 \u00d720\u2032\u2032 ) and were\nacquired in the histogram mode.\nDue to flexure of the instrument, only the LiF1 detector segment remains fixed with respect to a position\non the sky throughout an orbit. Thus, we only analyzed observations obtained with the LiF1a detector segment. The individual exposures were reprocessed using\nthe FUSE calibration pipeline software, CALFUSE (version 2.4.0), to extract a 1-dimensional spectrum for each\nexposure. The observations of the central star obtained\nin histogram mode were also processed using the CALFUSE pipeline with its default settings.\nThe diagnostics produced by the CALFUSE pipeline\nwere examined to ensure that the spectral extraction window was properly centered, and to exclude burst/flare\nevents and periods when the central star drifted into the\nHIRS aperture. Spectral drift between exposures was removed by cross-correlating the individual exposures relative to the longest exposure. The typical offset found\nwas generally less than 1 pixel (\u223c0.0067\u00c5) and never\nmore than 5 pixels. The individual exposures for each\nposition were then weighted by their exposure times and\ncombined. The coadded spectra for the N-Cav, N-Ext,\nOFF, and CS positions had total effective exposure times\nof 14.4, 13.7, 37.3, and 2.3 ks, respectively.\n3. RESULTS\n\nThe four FUSE spectra of NGC 6543 are presented in\nFigure 2. The CS spectrum shows very broad P Cygni\nprofile of the stellar O VI lines with numerous interstellar absorption lines of H2 and low ionization ions. The\nOFF position shows only airglow lines of Ly\u03b2 and O I.\nIn contrast, the spectra at the N-Cav and N-Ext show\nprominent narrow emission lines of C II \u03bb\u03bb1036,1037,\nbroad emission lines of O VI \u03bb\u03bb1032,1038, and a broad\nunidentified emission line at 1034.432 \u00c5, superposed on\ncontinuum emission that has a spectral shape similar to\nthat of the CS.\n\nFig. 2.- FUSE spectra in the wavelength range around the O VI\ndoublet. The aperture location is marked in the upper left corner of\neach panel. The dashed lines mark the rest wavelengths (Vhel =0\nkm s\u22121 ) for Ly\u03b2, and O VI \u03bb\u03bb1032,1038 lines. Absorption features\nof H2 , C II and O I are identified for the CS spectrum, emission\nfeatures are identified for the N-Cav spectrum, and airglow features\nare marked for the OFF spectrum.\n\nTABLE 1\nSummary of O VI Emission Line Detections\n\nObs.\n\nLine\n\nCentroid\n[km s\u22121 ]a\n\nFWHM\n[km s\u22121 ]\n\nIntrinsic\nIntensity\n[erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 ]\n\nN-Cav\n\n\u03bb1032\n\u03bb1038\n\n\u221283.1\n\u221279.9\n\n56.0\n45.9\n\n\u221213\n2.3+0.8\n\u22120.9 \u00d710\n\u221213\n1.2+0.4\n\u00d710\n\u22120.5\n\nN-Ext\n\n\u03bb1032\n\u03bb1038\n\n\u221288.9\n\u221288.6\n\n67.1\n51.4\n\n\u221213\n1.1+0.4\n\u22120.4 \u00d710\n+2.3\n6.7\u22122.1 \u00d710\u221214\n\na All velocities are in the heliocentric frame and assume\nrest wavelength for the O VI transitions of 1031.9261 and\n1037.6167 \u00c5 (Morton 2003).\n\nThe continuum emission in the nebular spectra is most\nlikely stellar emission scattered by dust in the nebular\ngas. To remove this contamination, we have scaled the\nstellar spectrum by factors of 0.018 and 0.0075 and subtracted it from the nebular spectra of N-Cav and N-Ext,\nrespectively. An expanded view of the O VI lines in Figure 3 shows that the continuum contamination is effectively removed and the weaker O VI \u03bb1038 line becomes\nmore prominent. We determine the centroid velocity and\nFWHM of each line by fitting a Gaussian profile, but\nmeasure the line intensity by direct summation. The\nO VI \u03bb1038 line flux and shape should be regarded with\nsome skepticism because the emission line is close to a\nstrong C II absorption line and is in a spectral region\nwhere the P Cygni profile from the central star may be\noversubtracted. The results of these measurements are\nsummarized in Table 1.\nTo convert from the observed to the intrinsic intensity of the O VI emission from NGC 6543, we adopt\nE(1034\u00c5\u2212V ) \u2243 10 E(B \u2212 V ), or A1034 \u2243 13.2 E(B \u2212 V )\n\n\fFUSE Detection of O VI from NGC 6543\n\nFig. 3.- Detailed FUSE spectra for the O VI \u03bb\u03bb1032,1038 lines\nfrom the N-Cav (top), and the N-Ext (middle). For comparison\nthe bottom panels show [O III] \u03bb5007 nebular emission from a\nlong-slit spectroscopic observation 4.\u2032\u2032 5 north of the central star.\nThe bottom left panel shows the echellogram and the bottom right\nshows the line profile extracted from the position marked by the\nhorizontal dashed lines on the echellogram. The systemic velocity\nof NGC 6543 is marked by a dashed vertical line in each panel.\n\ndetermined from the parameterized far-UV extinction\ncurve of Sasseen et al. (2002). The optical extinction of\nNGC 6543 has been determined by Wesson & Liu (2004)\nusing the Balmer decrement as determined from HST\nWFPC2 images in the H\u03b1 and H\u03b2 lines. It is shown that\nthe extinction is fairly uniform across NGC 6543 and the\naverage logarithmic extinction at H\u03b2 is c(H\u03b2) = 0.1. As\nc(H\u03b2) = 1.46 E(B \u2212 V ), the extinction at 1034\u00c5 is A1034\n= 0.90\u00b10.33, where the uncertainty is based on the observational scatter seen in far-UV extinction measurements\n(Sasseen et al. 2002). The intrinsic O VI line intensity is\ntherefore 2.3+0.8\n\u22120.9 times the observed intensity.\nIn Figure 3 we further compare the velocity profile of\nthe O VI lines to that of the [O III]\u03bb5007 line from an\neast-west oriented long-slit echelle spectroscopic observation taken at a position 4.\u2032\u2032 5 north of the central star.\nThe brightest emission component in the [O III] line image has low velocities and corresponds to the dense envelope of the nebular shell, and the faint expanding \"blister\" near the center of the line image corresponds to the\nnorthern extension of the central cavity. The heliocentric velocity of the O VI emission is similar to that of the\nexpanding blister in the [O III] line indicating that they\nare physically associated.\n4. DISCUSSION\n\nFUSE observations of NGC 6543 and NGC 7009\n(Iping, Sonneborn, & Chu 2002) detect, for the first\ntime, O VI emission from PNe. Since the central star\nof NGC 6543 is too cool to photoionize O V, the O VI\nions must be produced by thermal collisions in gas at\ntemperatures of a few \u00d7105 K at the interface layer between the cool nebular shell and the hot gas in the PN\ninterior. Therefore the intensity of O VI in NGC 6543\ncan be used to investigate the physical processes at the\ninterface.\nAre the FUSE observations of O VI from NGC 6543\n\n3\n\nconsistent with that expected from thermal conduction\nin such an interface layer? To model the expected O VI\nemission, we assume that the PN shell is a pressuredriven bubble and the radiative losses of the hot interior\ngas have a negligible effect on the dynamics. We further\nassume a constant AGB mass loss, resulting in a radial\ndensity profile \u221d radius\u22122 for the circumstellar medium.\nThe dynamics of such a bubble can be solved analytically\n(e.g., Garc\u0131\u0301a-Segura & Mac Low 1995) and is characterized by a pressure and age which can be expressed in\nterms of observed quantities such as the fast stellar wind\nterminal velocity and mass loss rate, and the nebular\nshell size and expansion velocity. To calculate the temperature and density structure at the interface layer, radiative losses and thermal conduction are considered by\nnumerically solving the continuity and energy equations\n(i.e., Equations (42) and (43) of Weaver et al. 1977)\nwhich rely directly upon the pressure and age found from\nthe analytic solution.\nThe central star of NGC 6543 has a fast wind terminal velocity of 1750 km s\u22121 and a mass loss rate\nof 4.0\u00d710\u22128 M\u2299 yr\u22121 (Perinotto, Cerruti-Sola & Lamers\n1989). Adopting a distance of 1.0\u00b10.3 kpc (Reed et al.\n1999), the radii of N-Cav and N-Ext are 0.02 and 0.04\npc, respectively. The expansion velocity of NGC 6543's\nnebular shell near the nebular minor axis is \u223c20 km s\u22121\n(Miranda & Solf 1992), which is appropriate for the NCav position. The [O III] emission associated with the\nN-Ext shows a velocity offset of \u223c30 km s\u22121 from the\nsystemic velocity of NGC 6543 (see Fig. 3); for an inclination angle of 35\u25e6 (Miranda & Solf 1992) the expansion\nvelocity will be \u223c40 km s\u22121 .\nUse of these observational parameters results in an analytic solution with a nebular age of \u223c1000 yrs and a\npressure in the central cavity of \u223c3\u00d710\u22127 dyne cm\u22122 .\nIf we compare these values with independent estimates\nwe find that the age is reasonable for NGC 6543 (e.g.,\nReed et al. 1999) but the pressure is roughly a factor of\n10 higher than indicated by observations of both the cool\nnebular shell and the hot gas interior. Consequently this\nsimple model would over-produce LX as did the models of\nZhekov & Perinotto (1998). Likewise, using the method\noutlined later, we find the expected O VI emission to\nbe \u223c10 times higher than observed. Both of these discrepencies arise from the incorrect model prediction of\npressure within the central cavity, and are likely caused\nby incorrect assumptions about the fast and AGB wind\nmass loss rates.\nTo obtain an alternative estimate of the O VI emission\nwe consider the observed pressure in the nebular shell\nand hot interior. In the nebular shell Zhang et al. (2004)\nfind an electron density of \u223c6300 cm\u22123 and temperature of 6800 K, and Robertson-Tessi & Garnett (2004)\nfind \u223c10000 cm\u22123 and \u223c8000 K, indicating a pressure\nof 1.2\u20132.2\u00d710\u22128 dyne cm\u22122 . For the interior hot gas\nChu et al. (2001) find that the X-ray emitting gas has a\nplasma temperature of \u223c1.6\u00d7106 K and electron density\nof \u223c50\u01eb\u22121/2 , where \u01eb is the filling factor. For \u01eb =0.5, the\npressure in the central cavity is \u223c3\u00d710\u22128 dyne cm\u22122 ,\nsimilar to the pressure in the nebular shell. We adopt\nthe pressure obtained for the hot gas in the continuity\nand energy equations to determine the temperature and\ndensity structure of the interface layer. The resulting\n\n\f4\n\nGruendl et al.\n\nFig. 4.- Results of the model calculation for the N-Cav observation of NGC 6543 showing profiles for the temperature (top),\nelectron density (middle), O VI emissivity (bottom) as a function\nof distance from the inner wall of the nebular shell.\n\ntemperature and density profile applicable to the N-Cav\nobservations are plotted as a function of distance from\nthe inner wall of the nebular shell in Figure 4.\nThe O VI density can be determined from the temperature and density profile by assuming ionization equilibrium and adopting a nebular oxygen abundance relative to hydrogen of 5.6\u00d710\u22124 (Aller & Czyzak 1983;\nBernard-Salas, et al. 2003). The O VI \u03bb 1032,1038 line\nintensity, IO VI , in ergs s\u22121 cm\u22122 can be derived from\nequations 4.4 and 4.11 of Spitzer (1978) and expressed\nas:\n8.629 \u00d7 10\u22126 \u03a9\u0304O VI (T ) \u2212\u03c7/kT V\ne\ngj\n4\u03c0d2\nT 1/2\n(1)\nwhere ne and nO VI are respectively the number densities of electrons and O VI ions in units of cm\u22123 , h\u03bd\n\nIO VI = ne nO VI h\u03bd\n\nis the average photon energy in ergs, T is the temperature in Kelvin, \u03a9\u0304O VI (T ) is the Maxwellian-averaged\ncollision strength1 , gj is the statistical weight of the\nlower energy state (in this case gj = 2), \u03c7 is the excitation energy of the upper energy state (in this case\n\u03c7 = h\u03bd = 1.92 \u00d7 10\u221211 ergs), V is the emitting volume\nin cm3 , and d is the distance to the object in cm.\nThe O VI emission per unit volume, jO VI , is plotted in Figure 4 and suggests the thickness of the emitting layer would be \u223c5\u00d71014 cm (0.00016 pc). To simulate the FUSE observations of N-Cav and N-Ext we\nintegrate jO VI over a short cylinder corresponding to\nthe volume intersected by the HIRS aperture, i.e., 4\u2032\u2032 radius and 1.\u2032\u2032 25-height). Based on these calculations we\nwould expect 5.2\u00d710\u221213 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 and 2.6\u00d710\u221213\nerg cm\u22122 s\u22121 at the N-Cav and N-Ext positions, respectively. While the predicted O VI emission intensity is\nroughly 1.5 times higher than observed, the two are consistent given the uncertainties in the model parameters.\nIn summary, we have detected nebular O VI emission\nfrom NGC 6543 from hot gas that is most likely at the\ninterface between the nebular shell and the hot, X-rayemitting gas within the PN interior. We have used the\nfast wind and nebular properties to model the O VI emission but find large discrepancies similar to those found for\nLX . This may result from overly simplistic assumptions\nfor the fast and AGB wind mass loss rates. The observed\npressures in the nebular shell and interior hot gas are\nsimilar. Adopting the hot gas pressure for the interface\nlayer, we find that the model with thermal conduction\npredicts O VI emission consistent with the observations.\n\nThis work was supported through the FUSE grant\nNASA NAG 5-12255.
