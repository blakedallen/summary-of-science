Calculations of energy levels and lifetimes for Eu III are used to control the accuracy.\nPACS numbers: PACS: 11.30.Er, 32.10.Dk, 31.15.Ne\n\nI.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThere have been recent suggestions by Lamoreaux\n[1] and Hunter [2] for searches of the electron electric\ndipole moment (EDM) in solid state experiments with\nthe compounds Gadolinium Gallium Garnet Gd3 Ga5 O12\nand Gadolinium Iron Garnet Gd3 Fe5 O12 . It is known\nthat an EDM of a system in a stationary quantum state\nviolates both time-reversal (T) and space-reflection (P)\nsymmetries. This is why searches for EDMs of elementary particles, atoms, and molecules are very important\nfor studies of violations of fundamental symmetries [3].\nThe best limit on the electron EDM comes from the\nBerkeley experiment of Regan et al. [4] with an atomic\nThallium beam, de < 1.6 \u00d7 10\u221227 e cm. There are ideas\non how to improve the sensitivity substantially working\nwith PbO [5] and YbF [6] molecules. An alternative that\ncan provide a real breakthrough is to use solids containing uncompensated electron spins. This idea was already\nsuggested in 1968 by Shapiro [7]. Application of a strong\nelectric field to electrons bound within a solid would align\nthe EDMs of the unpaired electrons. This should lead\nto a simultaneous alignment of the electron spins; the\nmagnetic field arising from this alignment could be detected experimentally. Another possibility is to polarize electrons by the external magnetic field. This causes\nalignment of electron EDMs, and hence induces a voltage across the sample that could be detected. An experiment of this kind has been performed with nickel-zinc\nferrite [8], however, due to experimental limitations, the\nresult was not very impressive. Interest in this approach\nhas been renewed recently owing to the suggestions by\nLamoreaux [1], Hunter [2] to perform similar experiments\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\naddress:\naddress:\n\u2021 Electronic address:\n\u00a7 Electronic address:\n\u2020 Electronic\n\ndzuba@newt.phys.unsw.edu.au\nsushkov@newt.phys.unsw.edu.au\njohnson@nd.edu; URL: www.nd.edu/~johnson\nusafrono@nd.edu\n\nwith Gadolinium Gallium Garnet and Gadolinium Iron\nGarnet, employing new experimental techniques. The estimates of sensitivity presented in [1] look highly promising; an improvement by several orders of magnitude is\nfeasible.\n\nThe first calculations of the expected effects have been\nperformed in recent papers Buhmann et al. [9], Kuenzi\net al. [10] using a semiempirical approach. The compounds under consideration contain Gd3+ ions, see\nRef. [11], that give the most important contributions to\nthe effect owing to their large nuclear charge. Therefore,\nfrom the theoretical point of view, the problem can be\nsplit into two closely connected, but still distinct, parts.\nThe first part is the evaluation of the EDM of a Gd3+\nion induced by an assumed electron EDM, and the second part is an account of the combined electron-lattice\ndynamics of the solid. It has been shown by Buhmann\net al. [9] that the main contribution to the Gd3+ EDM\ncomes from mixing between 4f and 5d electrons. This\nmixing depends on the energy separation between 4f 7\nand 4f 6 5d configurations. There are experimental data\non the relevant energy intervals [12]. However, Ref. [12]\ndoes not contain identification of all possible levels; therefore, one cannot rely completely on the data. It has been\npointed out by [9, 10] that accurate calculations of the\nenergy levels of the 4f 6 5d configuration of Gd3+ ion are\nthe needed to improve the accuracy of the EDM calculation.\n\nThere were recent measurements of lifetimes of some\nstates of the 4f 6 5d configuration of Eu III [13], which\nhas an electronic structure similar to Gd IV. Therefore,\ncalculations of lifetimes in Eu III provide a good test\nof the accuracy of E1-transition amplitudes which determine both lifetimes and the EDM enhancement factor. In\nthe present work we perform calculations of the energy\nlevels and lifetimes of both Eu III and Gd IV.\n\n\f2\nII.\n\nCALCULATION OF ENERGIES\n\nWe use two different sets of computer codes to do our\ncalculations. One is our own configuration interaction\nprogram and the second is a code written by Cowan [14]\nand freely available via the Internet 1 . We use both codes\nto compute energy levels of Eu III and Gd IV. Calculations for the Eu III are mostly done to control the accuracy. These two ions have similar electronic structure,\nhowever, much of the reliable experimental data is available for Eu III while limited data are available for Gd IV.\nWe restrict our study to the lowest odd configuration 4f 7\nand even configuration 4f 6 5d; these are the configurations most relevant to the atomic EDM.\nWe will describe our approach in detail while restricting our comments on the Cowan code to few general remarks. Since our calculations are relativistic, we will use\nthe abbreviation RCI (relativistic configuration interaction) to refer to them. We start our calculations using the\nrelativistic Hartree-Fock (HF) method. Calculations of\nthe self-consistent field are done for an ion in its ground\nstate. This is an open-shell system with 7 out of 14 electrons in its outermost 4f subshell. Therefore, we apply\n50% weighting to the contribution of the 4f subshell to\nthe HF potential. This weighting is further reduced to\n\u223c 46% when the interaction of a 4f electron with other\nelectrons of the same subshell is calculated (6/13 \u2248 0.46).\nNote, that our calculations are relativistic and we apply\nthe same weighting to both 4f5/2 and 4f7/2 subshells.\nRCI results for the 4f 6 5d configuration are sensitive to\nhow the 5d state is calculated. It is natural to calculate\nit in the field of the 4f 6 subshell, which means that HF\npotential is modified by removing a contribution of one\n4f electron. However, the 5d state obtained in this way\nis still not good enough to achieve accurate energy levels. This is probably because the self-consistent field is\ncalculated for the configuration 4f 7 and not for 4f 6 5d.\nTherefore, we further modify the 5d state by introducing\na correction to the HF potential in which this state is\ncalculated:\n\u03b1\n\u03b4V = \u2212\n.\n(1)\n4\n2(a + r4 )\nHere \u03b1 is polarizability of an ion in the 4f 6 configuration,\na is a cut-off parameter introduced to remove the singularity in the origin. Potential (1) describes the effect of\ncore polarization by the field of external electron. We\ntreat \u03b1 as a fitting parameter. Its value (\u03b1 = 0.5a3B ) has\nbeen chosen to obtain accurate energy levels for Eu III.\nThe value of a is not very important because the 5d wave\nfunction is small at short distances. We use a = aB . We\nuse the same values of a and \u03b1 for both Eu III and Gd IV.\nWe now have four single-electron basis states,\n4f5/2 , 4f7/2 , 5d3/2 and 5d5/2 . Many-electron basis states\n\n1\n\nftp://aphysics.lanl.gov/pub/cowan\n\nfor the RCI calculations are constructed by distributing\nseven electrons over these states in all possible ways.\nThen, many-electron states of definite parity and total\nangular momentum J are constructed. The actual matrix size depends on the configuration considered and the\nvalue of the total angular momentum J; it varies between\n1 (4f 7 , J = 25/2) and 377 (4f 6 5d, J = 9/2).\nEnergy intervals in the RCI calculations are sensitive\nto the value of Slater integrals (F2 (4f, 4f ), F2 (4f, 5d),\netc.). In the HF approximation, the value of these integrals, and consequently the energy intervals, are overestimated. This is because of screening of the Coulomb\ninteraction between valence electrons by core electrons\n(see, e.g. [15]). In the present work we include this\nscreening semi-empirically by introducing screening factor f2 = 0.8. The value of this factor was chosen to fit\nenergy intervals in Eu III. Thus, in the end, we have two\nfitting parameters, a core polarizability \u03b1 and a screening\nfactor f2 . The values of both of these factors are chosen\nfor Eu III and then the same values are used for Gd IV.\nCalculations with the Cowan code are very similar to\nthe RCI calculations. This is also a configuration interaction method, although in its non-relativistic realization.\nThere are also two fitting procedures in the Cowan code.\nOne is scaling of the Coulomb integrals by a factor of\n0.85. This is very similar to our screening of Coulomb\ninteraction. Another fitting which we use in the Cowan\ncode is changing \"by hand\" the average energy of the\nground state configuration. This is equivalent to shifting\nall energy intervals between the ground and excited configuration by the same value. A few more details about\ncalculations with the Cowan code will be given in Section\nIV.\nIII.\n\nCALCULATION OF LIFETIMES\n\nLifetimes of the three 4f 6 5d 8 P5/2,7/2,9/2 states of\nEu III have been recently measured by Zhiguo et al. [13].\nCalculations using the Cowan code give values which are\nabout three times smaller (see Table I). It is important\nto investigate the source of this discrepancy.\nIn a single-configuration approximation which we use\nin the present work, lifetimes of all states of the 4f 6 5d\nconfiguration are determined by single radial integral\nZ \u221e\nR4f,5d =\nR4f (r)R5d (r)r3 dr,\n(2)\n0\n\nand can be presented in a form\n2\n\u03c4i = Ai /R4f,5d\n,\n\n(3)\n\nwhere i denote a particular energy level. The parameter Ai is sensitive to the mixing of states (correlations\nbetween valence electrons) while there are also manybody corrections to R4f,5d due to correlations between\nvalence and core electrons. Since the ratio of experimental and calculated lifetimes is almost the same for all\n\n\f3\nthree 8 P states (see Table I), it is natural to assume that\nthe most of discrepancy comes from many-body corrections to R4f,5d . Note, that the ratio of the experimental\nand calculated lifetimes is even more stable in the work\nof Mashonkina et al. [16]. The ratio is 3.0 \u00b1 0.3 and the\ncorresponding lifetimes are presented in column four of\nTable I. Calculations in this work were also done with\nthe Cowan code, however the mixing of states was more\ncarefully considered.\nIn the HF approximation, R4f,5d = 0.77aB . Now we\ncalculate a correction to this value due to core polarization by the dipole electric field of the emitted photon.\nWe do this in the random-phase approximation (RPA)\nusing the time-dependent Hartree-Fock method (TDHF)\n[17]. The TDHF equations can be written in a form\n(\u01240 \u2212 \u01ebi )\u03b4\u03c8i = \u2212(f\u02c6 + \u03b4\u0302V )\u03c8i ,\n\n(4)\n\nwhere \u01240 is HF Hamiltonian. The single-electron orbital\n\u03c8i satisfies HF equation\n(\u01240 \u2212 \u01ebi )\u03c8i = 0,\nf\u02c6 is the operator of the external electric field, \u03b4\u03c8i is a correction to the orbital \u03c8i due to external field f\u02c6, and \u03b4\u0302V\nis the modification of the HF potential induced by corrections to the core states. Equations (4) are solved selfconsistently for all core states. Note that since Eu III and\nGd IV are open-shell systems, the same weighting procedure described in the previous section must be applied to\nleft-hand-side and right-hand-side of Eq. (4). The transition amplitude between states 4f and 5d in the RPA\nis\nh4f |f\u02c6 + \u03b4\u0302V |5di\n(5)\n(the HF approximation corresponds to \u03b4\u0302V = 0). Core\npolarization reduces the value of the R4f,5d radial integral\nbringing lifetimes into better agreement with experiment\n(see column \"RPA\" in Table I).\nThe remaining discrepancy should be attributed to correlations. A detailed investigation of correlations leads\nbeyond the scope of the present work, but one should\nnote that correlations increase the density of the external\nelectron at short distances. Therefore, owing to normalization, it must decrease the density at large distances,\nthereby decreasing the value of the radial integral. Calculated lifetimes are also sensitive to mixing of states.\nAnalysis of the RCI and Cowan code calculations shows\nthat the smallest mixing is for the 8 P9/2 state. Therefore, we can use this state to extract the value of R4f,5d\nthat ensures the best fit of the experimental data. This\nvalue is R4f,5d = 0.41aB for Eu+2 . To calculate lifetimes\nwhich correspond to the \"best fit\" value of R4f,5d , one\nneed only multiply the results from the Cowan code by a\nfactor of 3.6. In summary, the values of R4f,5d for Eu III\nand Gd IV are:\nEu III Gd IV\nHF 0.77 aB 0.63 aB\nRPA 0.56 aB 0.42 aB\nBest fit 0.41 aB 0.34 aB\n\nTABLE I: Lifetimes of 4f 6 5d 8 P5/2,7/2,9/2 states of Eu III\n(ns).\nExp.a\n65(7)\n46(5)\n36(4)\n\n8\n\nP5/2\nP7/2\n8\nP9/2\n8\n\na Zhiguo\n\nCowanb\n16\n15\n10\n\nCowanc\n24\n15\n11\n\nRPAd\n30\n28\n19\n\net al.

[18, 19]). We use the scaling factor of 0.8 in RCI\ncode and 0.85 in the Cowan code. Also the energies of\nthe 4f 6 5d LSJ levels are shifted by 13500 cm\u22121 in the\nCowan code relative to the ground state 4f 7 8 S7/2 . In\nthe RCI code we don't shift the energies but modify the\n5d state as was described in Section II, to improve the energy interval between the 4f 7 and 4f 6 5d configurations.\nIn Table II, energies of the 4f 7 LSJ, 4f 6 5d LSJ, and\n4f 6 6s LSJ levels in Eu III are compared with recommended data from the National Institute for Standards\nand Technology (NIST) by Martin et al. [20]. The 105\nlevels obtained from spectral analysis by Sugar and Spector [21] given in the NIST publication, classify about 300\nof the observed lines. It should be noted that the spectral\nanalysis in [21] was based on the Cowan code, probably,\na simpler version than we use here.\nIt should be noted that we use different coupling\nschemes in RCI (jj coupling) and Cowan code (LS coupling) to build energy matrices. We use, for convenience,\nLS coupling labeling of states; however, neither jj nor\nLS coupling can describe the physical states properly.\nTo combine together our results obtained with different\ncoupling schemes, we calculated Land\u00e9 g-factors for each\nlevel. For low-lying states, the g-factors are very close\nto their non-relativistic values and identification of levels\nis easy. However, higher in the spectrum, strong mixing\nbetween states makes level identification difficult. We restricted our calculations to levels which are reliably identified in both calculations.\nAs can be seen from Table II that results of both calculations for Eu III are in good agreement with one another\nand with experiment. This gives us confidence in similar\ncalculations for Gd IV.\nThe RCI calculations for Gd IV are done in exactly\nthe same way as for Eu III. All fitting parameters were\nchosen for Eu III and no a priori data on Gd IV was\n\n\f4\nused in the calculations. In a sense, we can say that\nthe Gd IV calculations are predictive. They produce an\nenergy spectrum of Gd IV regardless of what is known\nabout it. In contrast, the calculations with the Cowan\ncode are not exactly the same for both ions. While we\nuse the same scaling factor for Coulomb integrals (0.85)\nthe energy shift for the 4f 6 5d configuration is larger for\nGd IV (18000 cm\u22121 ) than for Eu (13500 cm\u22121 ). A larger\nenergy shift is needed to obtain good agreement with\navailable experimental data.\nIn Table III, we compare energies of the 4f 7 LSJ and\n4f 6 5d LSJ levels with available experimental data and\nand predicted data given by Kielkopf and Crosswhite\n[12]. It can be seen from Table III that for the 4f 7\nconfiguration the energies obtained by Cowan code E C\nare in better agreement with energies from [12] than are\nenergies obtained by RCI code E M . However, for the\n4f 6 5d configuration, results of both calculations are in\nvery good agreement with each other and with [12].\nIn Tables (II and III), we present lifetimes of the\n4f 6 5d LSJ levels calculated using the Cowan code with\nthe HF value of the R4f,5d radial integral. To get more\naccurate predictions for the lifetimes one should multiply the values presented in tables by the factor of 3.6\n(see section I).\n\nKB \u2248 \u22123.3. These two numbers were based on different\nassumptions about the energy splitting between 4f and\n5d states of Gd IV. The first number, (KA ) corresponds\nto E5d \u2212 E4f \u2248 40, 000 cm\u22121 which is a result of extrapolation from Eu III. The second number (KB ) corresponds\nto E5d \u2212 E4f \u2248 100, 000 cm\u22121 which is based on available experimental data for Gd IV (too incomplete at that\ntime to be fully trusted).\nThe present work clearly indicates that the correct energy splitting is closer to 100, 000 cm\u22121 and consequently,\nthe enhancement factor is rather -3.3.\nFurthermore, an analysis of lifetimes of Eu III suggests\nthat core polarization by the electric field of an external\nphoton is an important effect for both ions, Eu III and\nGd IV. It reduces the value of the R4f,5d radial integral\nby a factor of about 1.5. This effect was not included in\nthe calculation of the EDM enhancement factor (KEDM )\n[9]. Only contributions proportional to the R4f,5d radial\nintegral were considered in that work. To include core\npolarization by the electric field, one should divide the\nfinal answer of Ref. [9] by the factor of 1.5. This leaves\nus with KEDM = \u22122.2(\u22123.3/1.5).\nAcknowledgments\n\nIn a recent work on calculation of the EDM enhancement factor (K) in Gd IV [9], the result was presented\nin a form of two different numbers: KA \u2248 \u22126.4 and\n\nOne of the authors (V.D.) is grateful to the Physics\nDepartment of the University of Notre Dame for the hospitality and support during his visit in May, 2002.
