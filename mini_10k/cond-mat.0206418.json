The investigation on the superconducting ferrromagnets traces back to the original\nworks of Clogston4 , Chandrasekhar5, and Abrikosov et\nal.6 . At the same time, the possibility of a finite momentum pairing state coexisting with the long range ferromagnetic order was also revealed by Fulde and Ferrell7\nand by Larkin and Ovchinnikov8. This finite momentum\npairing state is usually called the FFLO state. These\nearly works4,5,6,7,8 focused on the superconductivity in\nthe metals with a spin-exchange field, such as produced\nby ferromagnetically aligned impurities. In such a superconducting ferromagnet, there are two kinds of electrons, respectively, responsible for ferromagnetism and\nsuperconductivity. One is the localized electrons forming\na ferromagnetic background in the metal by way of an\nindirect exchange coupling through itinerant electrons,\nthe other is the itinerant electrons forming the Cooper\npair due to an effective attractive interaction. Therefore, the magnetic exchange energy I is independent of\nthe superconducting gap \u2206. If the spin-exchange field is\nweak enough, the superconductivity can appear against\nthe ferromagnetic background. The ground state of the\nsystem is determined by the ratio I/\u22060 , where \u22060 is\nthe gap in a non-magnetic superconductor. In the threedimensional s-wave case, for I/\u22060 <\n\u223c 0.707 all of the\nitinerant electrons near the Fermi level form the Cooper\npairs with opposite spins and the center-of-mass momen<\ntum equal to zero4 , while for 0.707 <\n\u223c I/\u22060 \u223c 0.754 part\nof the itinerant electrons near the Fermi level form the\nCooper pairs with a finite center-of-mass momentum and\nthe unpaired electrons show a finite magnetization which\nis the paramagnetic response of the itinerant electrons\nto the exchange field caused by localized spins7,8 . For\nI/\u22060 >\n\u223c 0.754, the formation of the Cooper pairs is totally suppressed and the superconductivity is destroyed.\nIn the two-dimensional dx2 \u2212y2 superconductor, with the\n\nincreasing of the exchange field, the ground state of the\nsystem is changed from a zero momentum pairing state\nfirst to a finite momentum pairing state and then to a\nnormal state, the same as in the s-wave case except that\nthe zero momentum pairing dx2 \u2212y2 state in the magnetic\nfield has a finite magnetization9 .\nIn the recently discovered superconducting ferromagnets UGe2 1 and ZrZn2 2 , the superconductivity and the\nferromagnetism disappear at the same critical value, pc ,\nunder the application of the hydrostatic pressure. This\nfeature may suggest that the same electrons are responsible for both ferromagnetism and superconductivity in\nthese novel materials, in contrast to the conventional case\nof a metal with magnetic impurities. Very recently, along\nthis direction, Karchev et al.10 have developed a theoretical model, in which the long range ferromagnetic order does not result from an indirect exchange coupling\nbetween the localized spins, but is a consequence of a\nspontaneously broken spin rotation symmetry of those\nitinerant electrons which participate in the Cooper pair\nformation.\nIn this paper, we employ the model in Ref. 10 to discuss the possibility of the coexistence of spin-singlet superconductivity and itinerant ferromagnetism. There are\ntwo kinds of interactions between the itinerant electrons\nin this model. One is an attractive interaction in the\nBardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) form resulting in the\nsuperconductivity, the other is an exchange coupling resulting in the ferromagnetic order. Thus the magnetic\nexchange energy and the superconducting gap are related\nto each other and will be solved self-consistently. Under\nthe mean-field approximation, the thermodynamic potential of the superconducting ferromagnetic (SF) state\nand that of the non-magnetic superconducting (SC) state\nare obtained analytically at zero temperature. Our calculations include both the s-wave and d-wave cases. For\neach pairing symmetry, both the zero momentum and the\nfinite momentum pairing states are discussed. It is shown\nthat the thermodynamic potential of the SF state is always higher than that of the non-magnetic SC state in all\nfour cases. Therefore, the coexistence of ferromagnetism\nand spin-singlet superconductivity can not be realized if\n\n\f2\nthe same electrons are assumed responsible for both of\nthem. A spin-triplet superconductivity is more likely to\nsurvive in those novel superconducting ferromagnets such\nas UGe2 1,11,12 and ZrZn2 2,13,14,15 . In Sec. II to Sec. IV\nwe will explicitly illustrate this viewpoint for each case\nand in Sec.

Hamiltonian (1) contains a\nkinetic energy term, a ferromagnetic exchange coupling\nterm with strength J, and a four-fermion attractive interaction term with strength g. The coupling constant g\nhas a finite value only in the thin shell of the width 2\u01ebc\naround the Fermi surface, as in the standard BCS theory.\nUnder the mean-field approximation, Hamiltonian (1) is\nreduced to10\n\u0011\nX \u0010 \u2020\nHMF =\n\u01ebp cp~\u2191 cp~\u2191 + cp\u2020~\u2193 cp~\u2193\n\nX\u0010\n\nbreaking of spin rotation symmetry of the itinerant electrons, which is different from a paramagnetic response\nto a magnetic field caused by localized spins. Therefore, both the gap \u2206 and the magnetic exchange energy\nI = JM/2 are determined by Eqs. (3) and (4) selfconsistently, unlike in the conventional case of a metal\nwith magnetic impurities, where the exchange energy is\nconsidered as an external parameter4,5,6,7,8,9 .\nBy means of a Bogoliubov transformation, Hamiltonian (2) can be diagonalized as\n\u0011\nX\u0010\n(5)\nEp\u03b1 \u03b1p\u2020~ \u03b1p~ + Ep\u03b2 \u03b2p~\u2020 \u03b2p~ + E0\nHMF =\n\n(4)\n\nwhere \u01ebp = p2 /(2m\u2217 ) \u2212 \u03bc is the band energy measured\nfrom the chemical potential, h* * * i represents the thermodynamic average, M defines the magnetization of the system, and \u2206 is the superconducting gap. We note that the\ntwo constant terms in Eq. (2) result from the mean-field\napproximation, \u22062 /g comes from the BCS interaction\nand JM 2 /2 from the exchange coupling.

We take the thermodynamic potential of the ideal\nFermi gas as the origin of the energy in the following\ndiscussions.\nObviously, the self-consistent Eqs.

It is shown that, in the SF state, only part of\nthe\n\u221a itinerant electrons whose energies are in the range\nI 2 \u2212 \u22062 < |\u01eb| < \u01ebc form the Cooper pairs while\n\u221a other\nelectrons with energies in the range 0 < |\u01eb| < I 2 \u2212 \u22062\nremain unpaired. These unpaired itinerant electrons give\nrise to a finite spontaneous magnetization. Completing\nthe integrals in Eqs. (12) and (13), one finds that, for\nr > 1, the SF solution is given by\nr\nr\nr\u22121\nI=\u221a\n\u2206, \u2206 =\n\u22060 ,\n(14)\n2\nr+1\nr \u22121\nwhere r = JN (0)/2 is the dimensionless measurement\nfor the exchange coupling strength. Part of the electrons\nnear the Fermi level remain unpaired so that the superconducting gap \u2206 in the SF state is always less than \u22060 .\nHere, the exchange energy I results from the exchange\ncoupling between the itinerant electrons and is related\nto the gap \u2206, in contrast to the case of a metal with\nimpurities. For fixed r, the ratio I/\u2206 is a constant, independent of \u2206. When the gap vanishes the exchange\nenergy also decreases to zero. Substituting the SF solutions for the magnetization and the gap into Eqs. (5)\nand (6) and averaging out the mean-field Hamiltonian\n(5), one obtains the thermodynamic potential of the SF\nstate at zero temperature as\n1\n\u03a9SF = \u2212 N (0)\u22062 .\n2\n\n(15)\n\nComparing \u03a9SC with \u03a9SF , one finds that the SF state\nin the zero momentum pairing s-wave case is always energetically unfavorable due to \u2206 < \u22060 . This result can\nbe understood by the following argument. The spontaneous magnetization in the SF state is very weak and\nthe exchange energy I in the SF state is always less than\n\u22060 . From Eq. (2) and (14) one finds that the Zeeman\nenergy gained by the unpaired electrons can not compensate for the loss of the condensate energy in depairing the Cooper pairs. Therefore, all the itinerant electrons near the Fermi level remain paired with opposite\nspins, and the non-magnetic SC state is always more stable than the SF state. This feature is similar to that in\nthe conventional case of a metal with impurities, where\n\nfor I/\u22060 <\n\u223c 0.707 the itinerant electrons form a nonmagnetic SC state in the presence of an exchange field of\nthe ferromagnetic background. In the present case, the\nexternal exchange field is absent, so is the spontaneous\nmagnetization of the itinerant electrons. As a result, the\ncoexistence of s-wave superconductivity with zero momentum pairing and itinerant ferromagnetism can not\nbe realized.\nIII.\n\nFINITE MOMENTUM PAIRING s-WAVE\nCASE\n\nIn the conventional case of a metal with impurities, the\nformation of a condensate of finite center-of-mass momentum turns out to be more advantageous7,8 . Such a\nfinite momentum pairing state, where part of the itinerant electrons near the Fermi level form the Cooper pairs\nwith a finite center-of-mass momentum and the unpaired\nelectrons show a finite magnetization, is the ground state\nof the system when the exchange energy I is in a proper\nrange. However, if the exchange energy is caused by the\nspontaneous magnetization of the itinerant electrons and\nthus related to the gap, the conclusion is completely different, as will be shown below.\nHere, the center-of-mass momentum of the Cooper\npair, ~q, is not equal to zero, and thus the superconducting gap turns out to be a periodic function of the\ncoordinates8 , such as \u2206(~r) = \u2206 exp (i~q * ~r). The excitation energies of the Bogoliubov fermions in such finite\nmomentum pairing state are given by16\nq\n1\nEp\u03b1 =\n(16a)\n\u01eb2p,q + \u22062 + I + vF q cos \u03b8,\n2\nq\n1\nEp\u03b2 =\n(16b)\n\u01eb2p,q + \u22062 \u2212 I \u2212 vF q cos \u03b8,\n2\n\nwhere \u01ebp,q = (\u01ebp~+~q/2 + \u01eb\u2212~p+~q/2 )/2 = (p2 + q 2 )/(2m\u2217 ),\nvF is the Fermi velocity, and \u03b8 is the angle between the\nmomentum p~ and ~q. The diagonalized Hamiltonian, the\nself-consistent equation of the magnetization and the gap\nequation have the same forms as Eqs. (5), (6), (8), and\n(9), respectively, provided that \u01ebp is replaced by \u01ebp,q and\nthe excitation energies in Eqs. (7a) and (7b) are replaced\nby those in Eqs. (16a) and (16b). The momentum q is\ndetermined by the minimization of the thermodynamic\npotential, and vF q/2 is at most of the order \u22060 7 . By\nreplacing the summation over the momentum p~ with an\nintegral over \u01eb = \u01ebp,q /\u2206, the self-consistent equations at\nzero temperature can be written as\n!\nZ\nZ\n\u2206\n1\ndxd\u01eb\ndxd\u01eb\n\u221a\n\u221a\nln\n= \u2212\n+\n\u22060\n4\n\u01eb2 + 1\n\u01eb2 + 1\nEp\u03b2 <0\nEp\u03b1 <0\n= \u2212F1 (I \u2032 , y),\n\n1\nI\u2032 = r\n4\n\nZ\n\nEp\u03b2 <0\n\ndxd\u01eb \u2212\n\n(17)\nZ\n\nEp\u03b1 <0\n\ndxd\u01eb\n\n!\n\n= rF2 (I \u2032 , y),\n(18)\n\n\f4\n\u2202\u03a9\n1\n= F3 (I \u2032 , y) = 0,\n2\nN (0)\u2206 \u2202y\n\n(19)\n\nwhere I \u2032 = I/\u2206, y = (vF q/2)/\u2206, x = cos \u03b8 and F1,2,3 are\nfunctions of I \u2032 and y, independent of \u2206. From Eqs. (18)\nand (19), one finds that I \u2032 and y are determined only by\nr. Hence, the ratio \u2206/\u22060 in Eq. (17) is also a constant\nfor fixed r. Combining with Eq. (10), one obtains\nd( 1g )\nd\u2206\n\n= \u2212N (0)\n\n1\n.\n\u2206\n\n(20)\n\nThis result is quite different from that in the conventional\ncase where I is an external parameter and the right-hand\nside of Eq. (17), for fixed I, depends on the gap explicitly. The thermodynamic potential of the SF state with\nmoving pairs is given by applying the formula16\nZ \u2206\nd( g1 )\n\u03a9SF \u2212 \u03a9(\u2206 = 0) =\n\u22062\nd\u2206,\n(21)\nd\u2206\n0\nwhere \u03a9(\u2206 = 0) is the energy when the gap vanishes.\nIn our cases, the ratio I \u2032 = I/\u2206 is a constant for fixed\nr. When the gap vanishes the exchange energy also decreases to zero. Therefore, \u03a9(\u2206 = 0) here is actually the\nenergy of the ideal Fermi gas and is set to zero in our\ndiscussions. Completing the integral in Eq. (21), one\nobtains\n1\n\u03a9SF = \u2212 N (0)\u22062 .\n2\n\n(22)\n\nThe energy in the SF state with moving pairs defined\nin Eq. (22) takes the same form as that with immobile\npairs defined in Eq. (15), but the gap functions in the two\ncases are different, because they are determined by two\ndifferent self-consistent equations. Noting that the gap \u2206\nis always less than \u22060 , we find that the thermodynamic\npotential of the SF state with moving pairs is still higher\nthan that of the non-magnetic SC state. Our result is\ndifferent from that in FFLO state, in which part of the\nitinerant electrons near the Fermi level remain unpaired\nand give rise to a finite magnetization in an exchange field\n<\nof 0.707 <\n\u223c I/\u22060 \u223c 0.754 and other electrons form the\nCooper pairs with a finite center-of-mass momentum7 .\nThis is because that the Zeeman energy gained by the\nunpaired electrons in the SF state in the present model\nis less than that in FFLO state. In the conventional case,\nthe exchange field is caused by localized spins and the exchange energy I is an external parameter. Each itinerant\nelectron moving in the exchange field has an additional\nenergy I or \u2212I depending on the spin orientation of the\nelectron. The difference in number between spin-up and\nspin-down electrons results in a finite magnetization M .\nThe Zeeman energy of the system is given by \u22122IM . In\nthe present model, the exchange field is due to the spontaneous magnetization of the itinerant electrons and the\nexchange energy I is determined self-consistently. Therefore, the additional energy I gained by the electron in the\nexchange field here is actually the interaction energy between this electron and other itinerant electrons. The\n\nZeeman energy of the system is obtained by adding the\nexchange energy of every electron together, but the interaction energy between the two electrons should be countered only once. Thus, the Zeeman energy here is \u2212IM ,\nwhich is only a half of that in an external field with the\nsame I. This feature is embodied in Hamiltonian (2) via\nthe constant term JM 2 /2. Such a loss in the Zeeman energy results that the SF state with moving pairs is also\nenergetically unfavorable and the coexistence of the itinerant ferromagnetism and the superconductivity is more\ndifficult. As a result, if the exchange energy is caused\nby the spontaneous magnetization of the itinerant electrons and determined self-consistently, the s-wave nonmagnetic SC state is always more stable than the s-wave\nSF state, no matter whether the center-of-mass momentum of the Cooper pair is zero or not.\nIV.\nA.\n\nd -WAVE CASE\n\nZero momentum pairing d -wave case\n\nWe take a two-dimensional dx2 \u2212y2 superconductor for\nexample. The gap function takes the form \u2206(\u03b8) =\n\u2206d cos(2\u03b8), where \u03b8 is the azimuthal angle of momentum\n~p. The self-consistent equation for the magnetization remains the form of Eq. (8) and the gap equation is given\nby9\n\u2206d =\n\n\u03b2\n1 \u2212 n\u03b1\ng\u2206d X\np \u2212 np\nq\ncos2 (2\u03b8),\n2\n2 + \u22062 cos2 (2\u03b8)\n\u01eb\np\n~\np\nd\n\n(23)\n\n\u03b2\nwhere n\u03b1\np and np are the momentum distribution functions with the energies\nq\nEp\u03b1 =\n\u01eb2p + \u22062d cos2 (2\u03b8) + I,\n(24a)\nq\nEp\u03b2 =\n\u01eb2p + \u22062d cos2 (2\u03b8) \u2212 I.\n(24b)\n\nAt first, we consider the non-magnetic SC solution\n\u03b2\nwhere I = 0 and thus n\u03b1\np = np = 0. Carrying out the\nsummation in Eq. (23), the gap in the non-magnetic SC\nstate is obtained by\n\u2206d0 = 2.43\u01ebc exp(\u2212\n\n2\n).\ngN (0)\n\n(25)\n\nBy using Eq. (21), the thermodynamic potential of the\ndx2 \u2212y2 non-magnetic SC state at zero temperature is\ngiven by\n1\n\u03a9SC = \u2212 N (0)\u22062d0 .\n4\n\n(26)\n\nNext, we turn to the SF solution, where only part of\nthe itinerant electrons near the Fermi surface form the\nCooper pairs while other electrons whose energies satisfy the inequality, Ep\u03b2 < 0, remain unpaired. Replacing\n\n\f5\nthe summations over momentum ~\np in Eqs. (8) and (23)\nby the integrals over the energy \u01eb = \u01ebp /\u2206d and the azimuthal angle \u03b8, the gap equation and the self-consistent\nequation of the magnetization are reduced to\nZ\n\u2206d\n1\ncos2 (2\u03b8)\nln\n=\u2212\nd\u03b8d\u01eb p\n(27)\n\u2206d0\n2\u03c0 Ep\u03b2 <0\n\u01eb2 + cos2 (2\u03b8)\n1\nI\n=\nr\n\u2206d\n4\u03c0\n\nZ\n\nEp\u03b2 <0\n\nd\u03b8d\u01eb.\n\n(28)\nV.\n\nFrom Eq. (28), it follows that the ratio I/\u2206d is a constant for fixed r, and therefore the ratio \u2206d /\u2206d0 in Eq.\n(27) is also a constant for fixed r. The exchange energy\nI is related to the gap \u2206d , and decreases to zero as the\ngap vanishes. With the help of Eqs. (21) and (25), the\nthermodynamic potential of SF state is given by\n1\n\u03a9SF = \u2212 N (0)\u22062d .\n4\n\n(29)\n\nThe gap in the SF state is always less than that in the\nnon-magnetic SC state. Hence, the dx2 \u2212y2 SF state always has higher energy than the dx2 \u2212y2 non-magnetic SC\nstate. This result is the same as that in the s-wave case.\nB.\n\nFinite momentum pairing d-wave case\n\nIn the dx2 \u2212y2 SF state with finite momentum pairing, the excitation\nenergies of the quasi-particles take the\nq\nform Ep\u03b1 = \u01eb2p,q + \u22062d cos2 (2\u03b8) + I + (vF q/2) cos(\u03b8 \u2212 \u03b8q ),\nq\nand Ep\u03b2 = \u01eb2p,q + \u22062d cos2 (2\u03b8) \u2212 I \u2212 (vF q/2) cos(\u03b8 \u2212 \u03b8q ),\nwhere \u03b8q is the azimuthal angle of the momentum ~q which\nis determined by the minimization of the thermodynamic\npotential. The self-consistent equations in the finite momentum pairing d-wave case have the same structure as\nthat in the s-wave case. The equations for the magnetization and the momentum of the pair can be reduced to three expressions which only depend on I/\u2206d ,\n(vF q/2)/\u2206d , \u03b8q and r. Therefore, the variables I/\u2206d ,\n(vF q/2)/\u2206d and \u03b8q are found to be constant for fixed r.\nThe gap equation is reduced to the expression which only\ncontains the variables \u2206d /\u2206d0 , I/\u2206d , (vF q/2)/\u2206d , and\n\u03b8q . Thus, the ratio \u2206d /\u2206d0 is also a constant for fixed r.\n\n1\n\n2\n\nCombined with Eqs. (25) and (21), the thermodynamic\npotential of the SF state with finite momentum pairing\nis obtained as the same form as defined by Eq. (29) but\nthe gap here is different from that in the zero momentum\npairing case. It then follows that the energy in the dx2 \u2212y2\nSF state with moving pairs is also higher than that of the\nnon-magnetic SC state due to \u2206d < \u2206d0 and therefore\nthe SF state can not be realized.\n\nS.

In this model the electrons responsible\nfor the ferromagnetism and those forming the Cooper\npairs are the same and thus the exchange energy between\nthe two spin subbands is determined self-consistently, as\nopposed to the conventional case where the exchange energy is an external parameter. Under the mean-field approximation, the self-consistent equations of both the superconducting gap and the exchange energy are considered simultaneously, and the thermodynamic potential in\nthe non-magnetic SC solution and that in the SF solution\nare obtained analytically at zero temperature. We discussed four cases including both the zero and finite momentum pairing state with both the s-wave and d-wave\npairing symmetry. One finds that the exchange energy\nand the superconducting gap in the SF solution are related to each other. It is shown that the Zeeman energy\ngained by the unpaired electrons in the SF state can not\ncompensate for the loss of the condensate energy in depairing the Cooper pairs and thus the thermodynamic\npotential of the SF state is always higher than that of\nthe non-magnetic SC state in both the s-wave case and\nthe d-wave case, no matter whether center-of-mass momentum of the pair is zero or not. Therefore, the coexistence of ferromagnetism and spin-singlet superconductivity can not be realized if the same electrons are assumed\nresponsible for both of them. The present results indicate that a spin-triplet superconductivity is more likely\nto survive in those novel superconducting ferromagnets\nsuch as UGe2 and ZrZn2 , which are consistent with some\nnew progress11,12,14,15 .\n\n3\n\n4\n5\n6\n\n7\n\nD.
