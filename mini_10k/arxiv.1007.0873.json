A specific parametric form of\nthe effective interaction is postulated and the unknown\nparameters are determined a posteriori so as to reproduce a set of nuclear data selected according to a specific\npurpose. The non-uniqueness of the fitting procedure has\nthus lead to a large number of different parametrizations.\nSome of them may yield very different predictions when\napplied outside the domain where they were fitted [4].\nThis situation is particularly unsatisfactory for nuclear\nastrophysical applications which require the knowledge of\nnuclear masses for nuclei so neutron rich that there is no\nhope of measuring them in the foreseeable future; such\nnuclei play a vital role in the r-process of nucleosynthesis [5] and are also found in the outer crust of neutron\nstars [6]. Extrapolations far beyond the neutron drip line\nare required for the description of the inner crust of neutron stars where nuclear clusters are embedded in a sea\nof superfluid neutrons [7]. Such environments cannot be\nreproduced in the laboratory. However many astrophysical phenomena observed in neutron stars are precisely\nrelated to the physics of these outer layers [8]. The need\nfor more reliable extrapolations of these nuclear models\nhas motivated recent efforts to construct non-empirical\neffective interactions and more generally microscopic nuclear energy density functionals [9]. Unfortunately such\nab initio nuclear energy density functionals able to reproduce existing experimental nuclear data with the same\ndegree of accuracy as phenomenological interactions are\nnot yet available.\nFor the time being, a reasonable approach is to fit\nthese phenomenological interactions with as many avail-\n\nable nuclear data as possible, not only from experiments\nbut also from realistic calculations in infinite homogeneous nuclear matter. Very accurate nuclear mass models based on the Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov (HFB) method\nwith zero- and finite-range effective forces have thus been\nrecently developed [10, 11]. In particular in our model\nHFB-17 [12, 13], we have achieved our best fit ever to\nessentially all the available experimental mass data, the\nrms deviation for the set of 2149 measured masses of\nnuclei with N and Z \u2265 8 [14] being only 0.581 MeV. Significant improvements compared to our previous models\nhave been made possible by a better treatment of pairing\ncorrelations first introduced in Ref. [15] and extended in\nRef. [12, 13]. The effective interaction used in the pairing channel was constrained to reproduce the 1 S0 pairing gaps as obtained by microscopic calculations using\nrealistic nucleon-nucleon interactions. We have recently\napplied these effective forces to study the properties of\nthe neutron superfluid phase in the inner crust of neutron\nstars [16].\nThe effective pairing interaction associated with our\nnuclear mass models requires the evaluation of one dimensional integrals. Although its numerical implementation is straightforward, using such interaction could become computationally costly for large scale calculations\nsuch as the determination of fission barriers. In this paper, a more tractable expression of the pairing interaction\nis presented by calculating the underlying integrals analytically. We will consider effective interactions of the\nSkyrme type in the particle-hole channel. But results can\nbe easily generalized to other kinds of interactions.\n\nII.\n\nEFFECTIVE DENSITY-DEPENDENT\nCONTACT PAIRING FORCE\n\nThe pairing interaction that we consider here acts only\nbetween nucleons of the same charge state q (q = n or p\nfor neutron or proton respectively) and is given by\nv pair (rri , rj ) =\n\n1\n(1 \u2212 P\u03c3 )v \u03c0 q [\u03c1n (rr ), \u03c1p (rr )] \u03b4(rrij ) ,\n2\n\n(1)\n\n\f2\nwhere P\u03c3 is the two-body spin-exchange operator, rij =\nri \u2212 rj and r = (rri + rj )/2. Due to the zero range of\nthis interaction, a cutoff has to be introduced in the gap\nequations in order to avoid divergences (for a review of\nthe various prescriptions, see for instance Ref. [17]). In\nthis work we include all single-particle states whose energy lies below \u03bbq +\u03b5\u039b , where \u03bbq is the chemical potential\nand \u03b5\u039b is an energy cutoff. Although microscopic calculations in semi-infinite nuclear matter suggest that pairing\nin nuclei is a surface phenomenon [18], the density dependence of the pairing force is still poorly known. It is\ngenerally assumed that v \u03c0 q [\u03c1n , \u03c1p ] depends only on the\nisoscalar density \u03c1 = \u03c1n + \u03c1p and is often parametrized\nas [19]\n\u0012 \u0013\u03b1q \u0013\n\u0012\n\u03c1\n\u03c0q\n\u039b\nv [\u03c1n , \u03c1p ] = V\u03c0q 1 \u2212 \u03b7q\n,\n(2)\n\u03c10\n\u039b\nwhere \u03c10 is the nuclear saturation density while V\u03c0q\n, \u03b7q\nand \u03b1q are adjustable parameters. The superscript \u039b\n\u039b\non V\u03c0q\nis to remind that the pairing strength depends\nvery strongly on the cutoff used in the gap equations (in\nprinciple changing the cutoff modifies also the other parameters but the effects are usually found to be small).\nEffective interactions with \u03b7q = 0 (\u03b7q = 1) have been\ntraditionally refered as volume (surface) pairing. The\nparameters in Eq. (2) are usually fitted directly to experimental data. The standard prescription is to adjust\n\u039b\nthe value of the pairing strength V\u03c0q\nto the average gap\n120\nin\nSn [20]. However this does not allow an unambiguous determination of the remaining parameters \u03b7q and\n\u03b1q . Systematic studies of nuclei seem to favor a so-called\n<\nmixed pairing with \u03b7q \u223c 0.5 and 1/2 <\n\u223c \u03b1q \u223c 1 [21, 22].\nEven though such forces have been widely applied in\nnuclear structure calculations with some success, they\nlack a direct connection with realistic nucleon-nucleon\nforces. The reliability of these forces far beyond the\ndomain where they were fitted is therefore not guaranteed. In particular pairing forces fitted only to finite\nnuclei generally yield unrealistic pairing gaps in infinite\nnuclear matter [15, 23], thus rendering their application\nto neutron-star crusts unreliable. Garrido et al. [24] proposed to determine the parameters of the pairing interaction in Eq. (2) by fitting the 1 S0 pairing gaps in infinite\nsymmetric nuclear matter as obtained by the realistic\nParis potential in the BCS approximation. The parametric form Eq. (2) has been recently extended by Margueron et al. [25] who introduced an isospin dependence\nin the pairing strength in order to reproduce the 1 S0 pairing gaps in both symmetric nuclear matter and pure neutron matter as obtained from Brueckner calculations [26].\nThis approach assumes that the pairing interaction between two nucleons inside a nucleus is locally the same\nas the pairing interaction between two nucleons in infinite uniform matter. This should not be confused with\nthe so-called \"local density approximation\" which supposes that the pairing field \u2206(rr ) appearing in the HFB\nequations (see for instance Appendix A of Ref. [15]) is\nlocally the same in finite nuclei and in infinite nuclear\n\nmatter. Even though the coupling to surface vibrations\nis expected to contribute to pairing [27], a local pairing theory seems a reasonable first step [28, 29]. Finite\nsize effects can be subsequently taken into account by\nintroducing density gradient terms in the expression of\nthe effective pairing force as suggested in Ref. [30] in the\ngeneral framework of the density functional theory. Effective pairing forces with density gradients have been\nimplemented in Ref. [31].\nThe drawback of using a phenomenological pairing\nforce in order to fit microscopic pairing gaps in infinite\nuniform matter is that the functional form of the associated pairing strength is not a priori known. In particular different pairing gaps require different expressions of\nv \u03c0 q [\u03c1n , \u03c1p ] which can hardly be guessed due to the highly\nnon-linear character of pairing correlations [32, 33]. It\nshould also be remarked that the parameters of the pairing force depend on the effective interaction used in the\nparticle-hole channel since effective masses appear in the\ngap equations. Fitting the parameters of the effective interaction to essentially all experimental nuclear masses\nboth in the particle-hole and the particle-particle channels while simultaneously reproducing microscopic pairing gaps in infinite uniform matter would thus be an extremely onerous numerical task.\nIII.\n\nMICROSCOPICALLY DEDUCED\nCONTACT PAIRING FORCE\n\nActually as shown in Refs. [12, 13, 15], the densityand isospin dependence of the pairing strength can be\ncalculated exactly for any given 1 S0 pairing-gap function\n\u2206q [\u03c1n , \u03c1p ] by solving directly the HFB equations in infinite uniform matter yielding\n\u0012\n\u00133/2\nh\u03042\n8\u03c0 2\n\u03c0q\n(3)\nv [\u03c1n , \u03c1p ] = \u2212\nIq (\u03c1n , \u03c1p ) 2Mq\u2217 (\u03c1n , \u03c1p )\nwhere Mq\u2217 (\u03c1n , \u03c1p ) is the nucleon effective mass and\n\u221a\nZ \u03bcq +\u03b5\u039b\n\u03be\nd\u03be p\nIq (\u03c1n , \u03c1p ) =\n.

(3) instead of a phenomenological expression\nsuch as Eq (2) guarantees that in infinite uniform matter\nthe microscopic pairing gaps \u2206q (\u03c1n , \u03c1p ) will be exactly\nreproduced. It also ensures that the pairing strength\nis suitably renormalized for any change in the energy\ncutoff. The price to be paid is the evaluation of the\none dimensional integral, Eq (4), for the neutron density \u03c1n (rr ) and proton density \u03c1p (rr ) at all points inside\nthe nucleus. The computational cost becomes significant\nin fully self-consistent 2D and 3D calculations [6]. However we will now show that these numerical integrations\ncan be avoided by making use of the weak-coupling approximation.\nThe integrand in Eq. (4) is all the more peaked around\n(q)\n(q)\n\u03be = \u03bcq \u2243 \u03b5F as \u2206q is small compared to \u03b5F . This\n(q)\nsuggests to expand the integrand in powers of \u2206q /\u03b5F\nleading to\n\nin \u2206q /\u03b5F and \u2206q /\u03b5\u039b , and summing all coefficients, we\n\n+\u221e\nX\n\nn=1\n\n(n)\n\u22432\nI \u0303q\n\n\u0014 \u0010\n\u0011\u0015\np\np\n1\n1 + y\u22122 log\n1 + 1 + y \u22124 , (11)\n4\n(q)\n\nwhere y = \u03b5\u039b /\u03b5F . Adding Eqs. (9) and (11) in Eq. (7)\nleads to\n!\u0015\n!\n\u0014\nq\n(q)\n2\u03b5F\n\u03b5\u039b\n(q)\n(12)\n+\u039b\nIq = \u03b5F 2 log\n(q)\n\u2206q\n\u03b5\nF\n\nwith\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u0001\n\u039b(x) = log(16x)+2 1 + x\u22122 log 1 + 1 + x \u22124 . (13)\n\nThe highly-non linear character of the pairing phenomenon is evident in Eqs. (3) and (12). These equations also show that the density dependence of the pairing\nstrength is intimately related to the choice of the pairing\ncutoff. The contribution of the latter is entirely contained\nin the function \u039b(x). It can also be seen from Eqs. (3)\nand (12) that the pairing strength vanishes whenever the\npairing gap \u2206q goes to zero at finite density, as expected.\nNote that as a by-product we have also obtained a\nmore accurate expression of the pairing gap. Substituting\nEq. (12) in Eq. (3) yields\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\n(0)\n\u2206q = \u2206q exp\n\u039b(y) y \u22121/2 ,\n(14)\n2\n(q)\n\nwhere y = \u03b5\u039b /\u03b5F .\nWe have tested the validity of the analytical expression\ngiven by Eq. (12) as compared to the numerical integration of Eq. (4) using the effective interactions underlying\nour HFB-17 nuclear mass model [12, 13].

The pairing cutoff was fixed at \u03b5\u039b = 16 MeV.\nAs can be seen in Figures 1 and 2, Eqs. (3) and (12) provide a very good estimate of the pairing strength for all\ndensities and different isospin asymmetries. The figures\nalso show that keeping only the first term in Eq. (7) with\n(0)\nI \u0303q given by Eq. (9), leads to fairly good results except\nat low densities.\nAt very low densities \u03c1 \u2192 0, both the pairing gap \u2206q\nand the chemical potential vanish so that the integral\n\u221a\nIq is then simply given by 2 \u03b5\u039b . It is easily seen from\nEq. (3) that the pairing strength remains finite in this\nlimit and is given by\n4\u03c0 2\nv \u03c0 q [\u03c1 \u2192 0] = \u2212 \u221a\n\u03b5\u039b\n\n\u0012\n\nh\u03042\n2Mq\n\n\u00133/2\n\n,\n\n(15)\n\nassuming that Mq\u2217 (\u03c1 \u2192 0) = Mq . The weak-coupling\nexpression, given by Eqs. (3) and (12), tends to the exact limit as shown in Figure 3, whereas Eq. (9) leads to\na divergence (the corresponding pairing strength lies far\nbelow the range shown in Figure 3). The reason for this\ndiscrepancy lies in the underlying assumption of a constant density of s.p. states, which is strongly violated at\nlow\n\u221a energies \u03b5 where the density of states decreases as\n\u03b5.\nThe value of the pairing cutoff \u03b5\u039b can be a priori arbitrarily chosen. However it has been argued [24, 36]\nthat in the limit \u03c1 \u2192 0, the pairing strength should\ncoincide with the bare force in the 1 S0 channel, which\nin turn is determined by the experimental 1 S0 nucleonnucleon phase shifts. According to Eq. (15), specifying\nv \u03c0 q [\u03c1 \u2192 0] is equivalent to specifying the pairing cutoff\n\u03b5\u039b . As shown in Fig. 1 of Ref. [36], the optimal value of\nthe cutoff is \u03b5\u039b \u223c 7 \u2212 8 MeV (note that \u03b5\u039b is half the\ncutoff used in Ref. [36]).

The symbols are the results of numerically integrating Eq. (4) while the solid line was obtained from Eq. (12).\n\nshifts would thus remove the only free remaining parameter. On the other hand, choosing such a low cutoff can\ndeteriorate the precision of the weak-coupling approximation, since Eq. (12) was obtained assuming \u2206q \u226a \u03b5\u039b .\nWe have therefore calculated the relative error between\nthe pairing strength calculated numerically and that obtained from Eqs. (3) and (12), for different values of the\npairing cutoff. Results are shown in Figs. 4 and 5 for\nsymmetric nuclear and pure neutron matter respectively.\nWe have checked that the differences come solely from\nthe weak-coupling approximation, and not from the numerical method used to solve Eq. (4). It can be seen\nthat for the effective interactions underlying our HFB-17\nnuclear mass model [12, 13], the weak-coupling approximation is quite accurate since the largest relative error\nis of a few percent only for \u03b5\u039b = 8 MeV. The precision is\nhigher in neutron matter than in symmetric matter because the 1 S0 pairing gap of neutron matter is smaller\nthan that of symmetric matter. Note that the pairing\ngaps we adopted in our HFB-17 mass model are rather\nlarge (the maximum of the gap function \u2206q (\u03c1n , \u03c1p ) is\nabout 4.8 MeV in symmetric matter and 2.6 MeV in neutron matter). These gaps were obtained from Brueckner\ncalculations including medium polarization effects but\nwithout self-energy corrections [26]. When both effects\nare taken into account, the maximum pairing gaps are\nmuch lower [26]. The precision of the weak-coupling approximation would thus be even better with such gaps. In\nany case, if the constraint of reproducing the 1 S0 nucleonnucleon phase shifts is released, one is free to adjust the\ncutoff so as to achieve a better precision, as illustrated in\nFigs 4 and 5.\nIn the more general context of the nuclear energy density functional theory, the HFB equations can be obtained by minimizing the energy with respect to the\n\n\f5\n0.06\n0.05\n\n8 MeV\n16 MeV\n32 MeV\n\n0.04\n\n\u2202Epair (rr )\n.\n(17)\n\u2202 \u03c1\u0303q (rr )\nBecause Epair (rr ) depends on the nucleon densities, it contributes also to the mean-field potentials (see for instance\nAppendix A of Ref. [15]). Local pairing functionals can\nbe constructed from infinite nuclear-matter calculations\nusing Eqs. (3), (12) and (13).

(3), (12) and (13), can be easily implemented\nin nuclear-structure calculations. These forces could be\nhelpful for understanding the origin of pairing in finite\nnuclei, and could be used to estimate the importance of\nbulk contribution as compared to finite-size effects. Alternatively, the analytical solution of the BCS gap equations which we have obtained in Eq. (14), can be applied\nto calculate the pairing gaps in nuclear matter for any\ngiven contact pairing force (provided the conditions for\nthe weak-coupling approximation remains valid). Even\nthough we have been interested in nuclear pairing, the\npresent results could be easily adapted to other contexts.\n\nFIG. 5: Same as Fig. 4 but in neutron matter.\n\nnormal and pairing density matrices for a fixed average\nnumber of neutrons and protons [37] (the link between\ndifferent formulations of the HFB equations is discussed\nfor instance in Ref.
