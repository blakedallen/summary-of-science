Janik\u2217\nInstitute of Physics, Jagellonian University, Reymonta 4, 30-059 Krakow, Poland.\n\narXiv:hep-th/0610144v2 11 Jan 2007\n\nWe analyze the AdS/CFT dual geometry of an expanding boost-invariant plasma. We show\nthat the requirement of nonsingularity of the dual geometry for leading and subasymptotic times\npredicts, without any further assumptions about gauge theory dynamics, hydrodynamic expansion\nof the plasma with viscosity coefficient exactly matching the one obtained earlier in the static case\nby Policastro, Son and Starinets.\n\nOne of the more challenging problems in theoretical physics is the understanding from first principles of the behaviour of quark-gluon plasma, the phase of matter consisting of deconfined quarks and gluons. There are strong\nindications that the plasma observed at RHIC is indeed strongly coupled (see e.g. [1]) and is well described by models\nbased on hydrodynamics [2]. This suggests the need for nonperturbative techniques to study the dynamics of the\nsystem. This need is especially acute if one would like to study non-equilibrium phenomena, thermalization etc.\nA very powerful technique for studying nonperturbative properties of gauge theory has emerged from string theory\nin recent years [3]. In its original form the AdS/CFT correspondence states the equivalence of N = 4 Super Yang-Mills\ntheory and string theory in a curved 10-dimensional AdS5 \u00d7 S 5 background. What is crucial is that the string theory\nis easiest to handle in the regime of strong gauge theory coupling.\nAlthough the correspondence does not have a direct counterpart which works for QCD it has been argued that for\nstudying features of the plasma not too far above the deconfinement phase transition it may be a good approximation\nas the plasma is strongly coupled and deconfined.\nFrom a more general perspective, it is also interesting to study, for their own sake, dynamical time-dependent\nprocesses in the N = 4 supersymmetric theory within the context of the AdS/CFT correspondence in order to have\nan example where such phenomenae can be calculated exactly, as well as to develop in this context new methods to\naddress these dynamical issues. The methods used in the present paper translate questions on the behaviour of the\nplasma into certain questions within general relativity and we hope that this may inspire further research in both\ndomains.\nProperties of the N = 4 gauge theory at fixed finite temperature have been studied in some detail [4, 5], in particular\nshear viscosity has been calculated from perturbations around a static black hole background. On a more qualitative\nlevel, thermalization has been suggested to correspond to black hole formation in the dual description [6], while cooling\nwas advocated to correspond to black hole motion in the 5th direction [7].\nIn [8] a quantitative framework for studying such time-dependent phenomena has been proposed. The criterion of\na nonsingular dual geometry was shown to pick out uniquely, in a boost-invariant setting, asymptotic perfect fluid\nhydrodynamical evolution for large proper-times. The resulting asymptotic geometry was shown to be analogous to\na moving black hole. Further work within this framework includes [9, 10].\nThe aim of this paper is to show that the criterion of nonsingularity predicts, when applied also to subasymptotic\ntimes, viscous hydrodynamic evolution with a specific viscosity coefficient. As a byproduct we obtain a nontrivial\nconsistency check of the AdS/CFT correspondence for the value of the shear viscosity.\nBoost-invariant viscous hydrodynamics. Let us consider the spacetime evolution of the energy-momentum\ntensor of an expanding fireball of plasma. The energy-momentum tensor is constrained by energy-momentum conservation\n\u2202\u03bc T \u03bc\u03bd = 0\n\n(1)\n\nand, for the case of N = 4 SYM theory that we consider here, tracelessness T\u03bc\u03bc = 0. We will further restrict ourselves\nto boost-invariant evolution, first considered by Bjorken [11] as a model of the mid-rapidity region in heavy-ion\ncollisions. This assumption is also commonly used in hydrodynamic simulations for RHIC [2]. We will further assume\nno dependence on transverse coordinates. It is natural to use the proper-time/spacetime rapidity coordinates for\nMinkowski space:\nds2 = \u2212d\u03c4 2 + \u03c4 2 dy 2 + dx2\u22a5\n\n(2)\n\nThen energy-conservation and tracelessnes determine T \u03bc\u03bd in terms of a single function \u2013 the energy density \u03b5(\u03c4 ) (for\nexplicit expressions [15] see [8]). The dynamics of gauge theory should then determine \u03b5(\u03c4 ). In [8] we proposed to\nuse AdS/CFT to determine the proper-time dependence of energy density by first constructing the dual geometry to\na given \u03b5(\u03c4 ) and then requiring its nonsingularity to fix the physical \u03b5(\u03c4 ).\n\n\f2\nLet us review what would be the physical expectations for large proper-times if the gauge theory dynamics were\ndescribed by viscous hydrodynamics. If there would be no viscosity, then we would have\n\u03b5(\u03c4 ) =\n\n1\n4\n\n\u03c43\n\n(3)\n\nIf in addition we would have viscosity [16]\n\u03b7=\n\n\u03b70\n\u03c4\n\n(4)\n\nthen the energy density would behave like (see [10])\n\u03b5(\u03c4 ) =\n\n1\n\u03c4\n\n4\n3\n\n\u2212\n\n2\u03b70\n+ ...\n\u03c42\n\n(5)\n\nwith viscosity effects generating subleading deviations from the ideal fluid case (3).\nConstruction of a dual AdS/CFT geometry. The procedure of constructing the dual geometry to a gauge\ntheory configuration with given expectation value of the energy-momentum tensor was introduced in [12]. One adopts\nthe Fefferman-Graham coordinates [13] for the 5-dimensional metric\nds2 =\n\ng\u0303\u03bc\u03bd dx\u03bc dx\u03bd + dz 2\nz2\n\n(6)\n\nwhere the z coordinate is the 'fifth' coordinate while \u03bc is a 4D index. One solves Einstein equations with negative\ncosmological constant:\n1\nE\u03b1\u03b2 \u2261 R\u03b1\u03b2 \u2212 g\u03b1\u03b2 R \u2212 6g\u03b1\u03b2 = 0\n2\n\n(7)\n\nwith a boundary condition for g\u0303\u03bc\u03bd around z = 0:\n(4)\ng\u0303\u03bc\u03bd = \u03b7\u03bc\u03bd + z 4 g\u0303\u03bc\u03bd\n+ ...\n\n(8)\n\nThe fourth order term is related to the expectation value of the energy-momentum tensor through\nhT\u03bc\u03bd i =\n\nNc2 (4)\ng\u0303\n2\u03c0 2 \u03bc\u03bd\n\n(9)\n\nThe procedure is therefore to solve the 5-dimensional Einstein's equations (with negative cosmological constant \u039b =\n\u22126) with the boundary condition (8) for a given spacetime profile of the gauge-theoretical hT\u03bc\u03bd i. In the following since\n(4)\nwe will be dealing directly with the metric and hence with g\u0303\u03bc\u03bd so we will supress the factor Nc2 /(2\u03c0 2 ) throughout the\ncomputation reinstating it only in the final discussion.\nNonsingularity and viscosity. The metric consistent with the symmetries of the boost invariant expansion has\nthe form\nds2 =\n\n\u2212ea(\u03c4,z) d\u03c4 2 + \u03c4 2 eb(\u03c4,z) dy 2 + ec(\u03c4,z) dx2\u22a5 + dz 2\nz2\n\n(10)\n\nIn [8] the dual geometry was determined for asymptotic times with the energy-density behaving like\n\u03b5(\u03c4 ) =\n\n1\n\u03c4s\n\n(11)\n\nfor large proper-times. The resulting metric coefficients were given for large proper-times as functions of the scaling\nvariable\nz\nv= s\n(12)\n\u03c44\nIt was found in [8] that the resulting geometry was nonsingular only when s = 4/3, thus corresponding to perfect\nfluid hydrodynamics. Of course subleading corrections like (5) are possible. The explicit leading coefficients for this\ncase were found to be\na(v) = log\n\n(1 \u2212 v 4 /3)2\n1 + v 4 /3\n\nb(v) = c(v) = log(1 + v 4 /3)\n\n(13)\n\n\f3\nThe resulting geometry looks like a black hole whose horizon (in the Fefferman-Graham coordinates) moves in the\n1\n1\nfifth dimension as z0 = 3 4 \u03c4 3 . This leads to the temperature\n\u221a\n\u221a\n2 1\n2 \u22121\n3\n(14)\nT =\n=\n1 \u03c4\n\u03c0 z0\n\u03c03 4\n\u221a\nThe coefficient 2 comes from the special form of the black hole metric in Fefferman-Graham coordinates. See [8] for\na discussion.\nIn an interesting recent paper Nakamura and Sin [10] determined the leading, subasymptotic in proper-time,\ncorrections to the metric coefficients like\na(\u03c4, z) = a(v) + a1 (v)\n\n1\n2\n\n\u03c43\n\n+ ...\n\n(15)\n\nwhich represent \u03b5(\u03c4 ) of the form (5). The coefficients which can be extracted from the results of [10] in a form\nconvenient for proceeding to higher orders are\n(9 + v 4 )v 4\n9 \u2212 v8\nv4\n3 \u2212 v4\nb1 (v) = \u22122\u03b70\n+\n2\u03b7\nlog\n0\n3 + v4\n3 + v4\n4\nv\n3 \u2212 v4\nc1 (v) = \u22122\u03b70\n\u2212\n\u03b7\nlog\n0\n3 + v4\n3 + v4\n\na1 (v) = 2\u03b70\n\n(16)\n\n2\n\nHowever to this order in \u03c4 (O(\u03c4 \u2212 3 )) the Riemann tensor squared\nR2 \u2261 R\u03bc\u03bd\u03b1\u03b2 R\u03bc\u03bd\u03b1\u03b2\n\n(17)\n4\n\nwas found to be finite for any \u03b70 , the first divergence appearing only at order \u03c4 \u2212 3 . This behaviour suggested that in\n2\norder to determine the coefficient of viscosity \u03b70 one had to go one order higher in \u03c4 \u2212 3 . Namely one has to find the\nmetric coefficients to second order like\na(\u03c4, z) = a(v) + a1 (v)\n\n1\n\u03c4\n\n2\n3\n\n+ a2 (v)\n\n1\n4\n\n\u03c43\n\n+ ...\n\n(18)\n\nIn order to setup a systematic expansion procedure one expands the left hand side of the Einstein equations EA \u2261\n2\n4\n2\n4\n2\n2\n(\u03c4 3 E\u03c4 \u03c4 , \u03c4 3 E\u03c4 z , \u03c4 3 Ezz , \u03c4 \u2212 3 Eyy , \u03c4 3 Exx ) in powers of \u03c4 \u2212 3 :\n(0)\n\n(1)\n\nEA = EA (v) + EA (v)\n\n1\n2\n\n\u03c43\n\n(2)\n\n+ EA (v)\n\n1\n4\n\n\u03c43\n\n+ ...\n\n(19)\n\nwhere A = 1 . . . 5 numbers the five nontrivial components of the Einstein equations mentioned above. The prefactors\n(0)\nare chosen in such a way as to have a uniform expansion. The leading order results (13) satisfy EA = 0 while\n(1)\nthe first subleading corrections (16) satisfy EA = 0. Therefore in order to find a2 (v), b2 (v), c2 (v) we have to solve\n(2)\nthe equations EA = 0 with the boundary condition that these coefficient functions should vanish at v = 0. The\nresulting expressions depend on the viscosity coefficient \u03b70 and another coefficient which we denote by C.

The resulting expression at this order has the form\nR2 = nonsingular terms +\n\n1 polynomial in v, \u03b70 and C\n4\n(3 \u2212 v 4 )4 (3 + v 4 )6\n\u03c43\n\n(21)\n\n1\n\nWe see that there is a potential singularity at v = 3 4 . It turns out that the singularity is cancelled exactly when\n\u221a\n3\n2\n\u03b70 =\n(22)\n18\nThere is no restriction on C at this order. We expect one would have to perform the analysis to the next order to fix\nC [14].\nThe above calculation shows that nonsingular dual geometry is not possible for an exact perfect fluid, but that\nviscosity effects in the proper-time evolution are present with a uniquely fixed value of the viscosity coefficient given\nby (22). It is interesting to compare this value with the shear viscosity obtained by Policastro, Son and Starinets [4]\nwho derived it by studying the reponse of a static plasma at fixed temperature to small perturbations.\nTo this end let us take the value of (shear) viscosity obtained in [4] at a fixed temperature T :\n\u03b7=\n\n1\n\u03c0\ns = Nc2 T 3\n4\u03c0\n8\n\n(23)\n\nIf we insert the proper-time dependence of the temperature (14) for the evolving plasma into the above expression we\nobtain\n\u03b7=\n\n1\n1\nNc2\n* 1 3 *\n2\n2\u03c0 2 2 3 4 \u03c4\n\n(24)\n\nwhere we have factored out the coefficient Nc2 /(2\u03c0 2 ) appearing in (9). The resulting estimate for the viscosity\ncoefficient \u03b70 is therefore\n\u03b70 =\n\n1\n1\n\n3\n\n22 34\n\n\u2261\n\n\u221a ! 12\n3\n18\n\n(25)\n\nwhich is exactly the value (22) for which the dual background geometry of the evolving plasma is nonsingular.\nDiscussion.\nIn this paper we have studied the proper-time evolution of a boost-invariant plasma using the\nAdS/CFT correspondence. We have shown that the requirement that the dual geometry is nonsingular predicts the\nproper-time evolution of the energy density to be equal [17] to the one found from viscous hydrodynamics with the\nviscosity being exactly the one following from \u03b7/s = 1/(4\u03c0) in the static case. The computation involves the nonlinear\nregime of gravity on the AdS/CFT side and it is encouraging for other possible applications that the method can\ncapture such fine details of the gauge theory dynamics.\nIt would be very interesting to study in more detail the features of this geometry and its thermodynamics [14], as\nwell as to apply these techniques to other dynamical non-equilibrium processes.\nAcknowledgments.
