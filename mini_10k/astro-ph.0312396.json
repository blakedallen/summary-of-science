For those microquasars\nwhere the mass of the central X-ray source is known, the black hole spin can be deduced from a comparison of the observed\nand expected frequencies.\n\nINTRODUCTION\nSeveral Galactic low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) exhibit quasi-periodic variability (QPOs) of their X-ray\nfluxes, with pairs of \u2248 1 kHz frequencies typical in\nthe neutron-star sources [1]. Klu\u017aniak and Abramowicz\n[2, 3] suggested that these twin kHz QPOs are a manifestation of non-linear resonance that can occur between\nmodes of oscillation in an accretion disk in strong field\nEinstein's gravity, but not in Newton's 1/r potential, and\npointed out that on this hypothesis the same resonances\nshould be present in black hole systems. Pairs of high frequency QPOs should have been present where only single hHz QPOs had been reported in microquasars. Such\npairs of several hHz frequencies have now been reported\nin four or five black-hole systems, all in a 3:2 ratio [4],\nsubstantially strengthening the case for resonance.\nOur originally suggested [2] explanation for kHz\nQPOs in neutron stars was based on these general properties of non-linear resonance, which seemed to us to correspond to the essential features of the observed twin frequency peaks:\n1. The frequencies of non-linear oscillations \u03bd depend on amplitude, and for this reason they may\nbe time dependent and may differ from the fixed\neigenvalue frequencies \u03bd (0) of the system, \u03bd (t) =\n\u03bd (0) + \u03b4 \u03bd (t).\n2. Non-linear resonance may occur over a wide frequency range \u03b4 \u03bd .\n3. Both (resonant) frequencies increase or decrease \"in\nstep\" with each other.\n4. The eigenfrequencies of resonant modes are approximately in the ratio of small integers, e.g., 2:1.\n\nThese ideas initially received a cool reception (see author's note in [3]), because it was not generally appreciated that frequency ratios close to 3:2 actually occur1 for\nkHz QPOs in neutron star sources, and no evidence for\ntwin peaks in black hole sources was known at the time.\nIn addition to the high frequency QPOs, features in the\npower density spectra can be identified at lower frequencies, and at least one frequency \u03bdlow was long known\nto be correlated with \u03bdhigh , one of the kHz/hHz frequencies in neutron-star/black-hole systems [6]. Quasiperiodic modulations of the flux (dwarf nova oscillations, DNOs) were first discovered in cataclysmic variables (white dwarfs) and these are analogous in many\nrespects to the QPOs in LMXBs [7]. However, unlike\nthe kHz/hHz QPOs, the highest frequency DNOs do\nnot come in pairs. This is consistent with the idea that\nthe high frequency pairs arise in accretion disks only in\nstrong gravity.\nThe relativistic resonance model of black hole QPOs is\nbased on fundamental features of strong gravity. Today,\nit is motivated by observations that sharply illuminate the\nphysical nature of QPOs:\n1. The correlation \u03bdlow = 0.08\u03bdhigh between low and\nhigh frequency QPOs in black hole, neutron stars,\nand white dwarf sources extending over six orders\nof magnitude [6, 8, 9], proves that in general the\nQPOs are a hydrodynamic phenomenon, and cannot be attributed to mere kinematic effects, such\nas Doppler modulation of emission from isolated\nbright spots. (\u03bdlow may be the \"ninth wave\" [10].)\n\n1\n\nIndeed, our paper on this appeared in print only much delayed [5].\n\n\fTABLE 1. The four microquasars in which\ntwo hHz QPOs are observed. They all have 3:2\nratio of frequencies. Source of data: [4, 18]\n\n2. The frequencies of twin peak hHz QPOs in microquasars seem to scale with mass [4], \u03bd \u223c 1/M (Figure 1). If true, this would prove their relativistic origin.\n3. In all four microquasars with twin peak hHz QPO\npairs, \u03bdupper /\u03bdlower = 3/2 (Table 1).\n\nTHE ORBITAL AND EPICYCLIC\nMOTIONS.\nConsider a black hole2 with the mass M0 and angular\nmomentum J0 . Inside thin, almost Keplerian accretion\ndisks, matter spirals down the central black hole along\nstream lines that are located almost on the equatorial\nplane \u03b8 = \u03b80 = \u03c0 /2, and that locally differ only slightly\nfrom a family of concentric circles r = r0 = const. The\nsmall deviations, \u03b4 r = r \u2212 r0 , \u03b4 \u03b8 = \u03b8 \u2212 \u03b80 are governed,\nwith accuracy to linear terms, by\n\n\u03b4 r\u0308 + \u03c9r2 \u03b4 r = \u03b4 ar ,\n\n\u03b4 \u03b8\u0308 + \u03c9\u03b82 \u03b4 \u03b8 = \u03b4 a\u03b8 .\n\n(1)\n\nHere, the dot denotes a time derivative. For purely Keplerian (free) motion \u03b4 ar = 0, \u03b4 a\u03b8 = 0 and the above\nequations describe two uncoupled harmonic oscillators\nwith the eigenfrequencies \u03c9\u03b8 \u2261 2\u03c0\u03bd\u03b8 , \u03c9r \u2261 2\u03c0\u03bdr shown\ntogether with the Keplerian orbital frequency, \u03a9 \u2261 2\u03c0\u03bdK ,\nin Figure 2 for a non-rotating black hole, and in Figure 3\nfor a moderately rotating one.\n\n2\nWe rescale mass with M = GM0 /c2 = rG , angular momentum with\na = J0 c/(M02 G). We use Boyer-Lindquist coordinates, t,r, \u03b8 , \u03c6 , and\nrescale the radius with x = r/rG .\n\n\u03bdupper\n\n\u03bdlower\n\nXTE 1550-564\nGRO 1655-40\nGRS 1915+105\nH 1743-322\n\n276\n450\n168\n240\n\n174\n300\n113\n160\n\nM=M\n\n6\n2.7\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\n\n14\n\n16 18\n- 500Hz\n- 450Hz\n- 400Hz\n\n1655-40\n\n2.6\nlog (\u0017 [ Hz \u2104)\n\nAlthough suggestive of a resonance, the ratio 3/2 could\nalso be a signature of overtones (flute modes) [11], or of\nhigher modes of an MHD instability [12] at a 'transition radius' r\u2217 in the innermost part of the disk, which\nexcites quasi periodic oscillations with mode frequencies \u03bd \u223c n \u03bdK (r\u2217 ) (in contrast with the resonance model,\nneither of these two models predicts 1/M scaling, without making some ad hoc assumptions). However, there\nare additional properties of non-linear resonances which\nmay help in their identification. In a non-linear resonance\ncombination frequencies, e.g., \u03bdupper \u00b1 \u03bdlower , and subharmonic frequencies may be present [13], e.g., \u03bdlower /2.\nOur resonance model may also be applied to twin peak\nQPO sources in neutron stars [13]. In refs. [14, 15], and\nin these Proceedings [16], we discuss a resonance in an\naccretion disk or torus excited by an external forcing\nby a millisecond pulsar. A similar forcing is crucially\nimportant in a different, non-relativistic resonance model\nsuggested by Titarchuk [17].\n\nMicroquasar\n\n- 350Hz\n2.5\n\n- 300Hz\n\n1550-564\n\n- 250Hz\n\n2.4\n\n- 200Hz\n\n2.3\n1915+105\n\n2.2\n0.8\n\n0.9\n\n1\n\n1.1\n\n1.2\n\n1.3\n\nlog (M=M )\n\nFIGURE 1.

The radial epicyclic\nfrequency \u03bdr goes to zero at the Innermost Stable Circular Orbit for the Keplerian (free) motion, and has a\nmaximum at a particular circular orbit outside the ISCO,\nits location depends on the black hole spin [19, 20, 21].\n\n1/M SCALING\nBefore the RXTE era, Klu\u017aniak, Michelson, Wagoner\n[22] suggested that the orbital frequency close to the\nmarginally stable orbit may be directly observed as a\nQPO, once instruments with sufficiently high time resolution are built, and pointed out that the frequency will\nbe inversely proportional to the mass of the compact object. The latter statement applies to any characteristic frequency in general relativity.\nFor example, note that for black holes, all three orbital\nfrequencies: Keplerian \u03bdK , radial epicyclic \u03bdr , and vertical epicyclic \u03bd\u03b8 , also have the general form\n\n\u03bd = f (x, a)\n\n\u0012\n\nGM0\nrG3\n\n\u00131/2\n\n,\n\n(2)\n\n\fross at\n621 Hz\n\na=0\n\n6\n\n?\n\n280\n240\n\n\u0017 [ Hz \u2104\n\n200\n\u0017\u0012 = \u0017K\n\n160\n120\n\n\u0017max\n\u0012\n\n80\n\nrph\n\nrh\n\n\u0017r\n\n40\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\n\n14\n\nr=M\n\nr < rin . The transition radius r = rin , closely coinciding\nwith the sonic point, is often called the inner radius of\nthe accretion disk.

In general, the inner edge is\nlocated between the ISCO and the marginally bound\n(RISCO, at rmb ) circular orbits [23], depending on the\ndisk efficiency. ADAFs, with their very low efficiencies,\nhave the inner edges almost exactly at RISCO [24]. The\nsame is true for super-Eddington slim [25] and thick\n[23] disks.

For the\nnon-rotating black hole hole rtrap = 8M [21]. The gmode (inertial-gravity) oscillations [30] can be characterized by a restoring force that is typically dominated by\nthe net gravitational-centrifugal force. The axisymmetric\n(m = 0) g-modes are centered at rtrap .

For example, g-modes have pattern frequency 2\u03c0\u03bdm = \u00b1(\u03bdr \u00b1 m\u03bdK ), and these can be in\nco-rotation resonance, i.e., with \u03bdm = \u03bdK [34]. The case\n\u03bdK /\u03bdr = 3/2 is excluded by observations [33] (Fig. 8).\nThe remaining possibilities [33] are that the upper frequency is \u03bdK \u00b1 \u03bdr , with \u03bdK /\u03bdr = 2, or \u03bdK /\u03bdr = 3, and\n\u03bdupper /\u03bdr = 3/2 (Figs. 9, 10). However, co-rotation resonance leads to damping, and not excitation, of modes\n[35].\nAnother possibility is based on the following idea\n[36]. When the potential vorticity is conserved, coherent\nvortices tend to form in pairs with opposite vortices. One\nmay imagine that because the spatial distance between\n\n\fthe two structures, which oscillates with the epicyclic\nradial frequency, depends on the velocity profile of the\ndisk, i.e., also on the oscillations of orbital velocity, a\nresonance between these two frequencies is possible.\nM=M\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\n\n14\n\n16 18\n-\n\n1655-40\n\n2.6\n\nlog (\u0017 [ Hz \u2104)\n\n1550-564\n\n500Hz\n450Hz\n400Hz\n350Hz\n\nEpicyclic motions\nThe effective potential U(r, \u03b8 ; l) for orbital motion of\na particle with a fixed angular momentum l > lms has\na minimum at r0 (l), corresponding to the location of a\nstable circular orbit.

In thin disks, random fluctuations have\n\u03b4 r \u226b \u03b4 \u03b8 . Thus, \u03b4 r\u03b4 \u03b8 is a first order term in \u03b4 \u03b8 and\nshould be included in the first order equation for vertical\noscillations (1). The equation now takes the form,\n(10)\n\nwhere h is a known constant. The first order equation for\n\u03b4 r has the solution \u03b4 r = A0 cos(\u03c9r t). Inserting this in\n(10) together with \u03b4 a\u03b8 = 0, one arrives at the Mathieu\nequation (A0 is absorbed in h),\n\n\u03b4 \u03b8\u0308 + \u03c9\u03b82 [1 + h cos(\u03c9r t)] \u03b4 \u03b8 = 0,\n\n(12)\n\n1.3\n\nThe 2:1 forced epicyclic resonance.\n\n\u03b4 \u03b8\u0308 + \u03c9\u03b82 [1 + h \u03b4 r] \u03b4 \u03b8 = \u03b4 a\u03b8 ,\n\nn = 1, 2, 3...,\n\nthe parametric resonance is excited [37, 38]. The resonance is strongest for the smallest possible value of\nn. Because near black holes \u03bdr < \u03bd\u03b8 , the smallest possible value for resonance is n = 3, which means that\n2 \u03bd\u03b8 = 3 \u03bdr .
