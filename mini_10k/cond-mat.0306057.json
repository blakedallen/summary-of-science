Flux flow resistivity exhibits unusual field\ndependence with strong enhancement at low field, which is markedly different to conventional s-wave\nsuperconductors. A crossover field which separates two distinct flux flow regimes having different\n\u03c1f slopes was clearly observed in H k ab-plane. The unusual H-dependence indicates that two very\ndifferently sized superconducting gaps in MgB2 manifest in the vortex dynamics and almost equally\ncontribute to energy dissipation. The carrier scattering rate in two different bands is also discussed\nwith the present results, compared to heat capacity and thermal conductivity results.\nPACS numbers: 74.25.Fy,74.25.Nf,74.70.Ad\n\nSince the recent discovery of high temperature superconductivity in MgB2 , great attention has been directed\ntowards understanding the detailed nature of superconductivity [1, 2]. MgB2 consists of two bands having\nroughly equal density of states (DOS), strongly two dimensional \u03c3-band (spx py ) and three dimensional \u03c0-band\n(pz ) bands. Associated with these two bands, two very\ndifferently sized superconducting gaps are quite distinct\nand manifest themselves clearly in many physical properties, which have become one of the central topic of\nthe physical properties of MgB2 . In fact, apart from\nthe much debated pairing mechanism of high transition temperature superconductivity, physical properties\nin the superconducting state i.e., the distinguishing characteristics of a superconductor with two gaps, are still\nlargely unexplored. Recent scanning tunneling microscope (STM) [3], heat capacity [4], and thermal conductivity [5] measurements have revealed that the physical\nproperties in the vortex state of MgB2 are dramatically\ndifferent from those expected in conventional s-wave superconductors. Despite these extensive studies, however,\nthe dynamical properties of the vortices, such as the energy dissipation associated with the vortex motion which\nis intimately related to the electronic structure [6, 7, 8, 9],\nare still far from being completely understood.\nWhen a vortex line in a type-II superconductor responds to a driving current, frictional force is given by\nthe damping viscosity, which in turn depends on the energy dissipation process of quasiparticles in and around\nthe vortex cores. To gain an understanding of this energy dissipation, experimental determination of the free\nflux flow (FFF) resistivity is particularly important. FFF\nrefers to a purely viscous vortex motion of vortices, which\nis realized when the vortices move in pinned free states.\nThe FFF state in conventional s-wave superconductors\nhas been extensively studied and a rather good understanding has been developed. In s-wave superconductors,\nquasiparticles trapped within the vortex core that form\n\nCaroli-de Gennes-Matricon bound states play a key role\nin the dissipation process [6, 7]. The FFF resistivity \u03c1f\nis essentially proportional to normal state resistivity \u03c1n\nand applied field,\n\u03c1f =\n\nH\n\u03c1n .\nHc2\n\n(1)\n\nThis Bardeen-Stephen relationship has been confirmed in\nmost diry and clean s-wave systems throughout almost\nthe whole Abrikosov phase. Recently, striking deviation\nof FFF resistivity from Eq.(1) has been reported in unconventional superconductors with gap nodes [8, 9, 10,\n11, 12, 13]. For instance, in d-wave Bi2 Sr2 CuO6+\u03b4 , \u03c1f\nexhibits a H-linear dependence at low fields, followed by\na non-linear H-dependence described well by,\nr\nH\n\u03c1n ,\n(2)\n\u03c1f \u221d\nHc2\nat higher fields [9]. This demonstrates that the energy\ndissipation is strongly influenced by the superconducting\ngap structure. However, despite these extensive studies\nof the FFF state, the detailed microscopic mechanism of\nenergy dissipation is not well understood, exposing our\nincomplete knowledge of vortex dynamics. This situation\nthus calls for a new textbook example of FFF resistivity\nin a superconductor with a distinctive gap structure. The\nFFF resistivity of MgB2 with two distinct superconducting gaps may provide an unique opportunity for studying\nhow the energy dissipation occurs when vortices move in\nthe superfluid.\nIn this paper, FFF resistivities of MgB2 are examined by measuring microwave surface impedance. FFF\nresistivity exhibits unusual field dependence, which is\nmarkedly different from conventional s-wave superconductors. These results are discussed in terms of energy\ndissipation in the superconductors with two distinct gaps.\nHigh quality single crystals of MgB2 (Tc =38.6 K) were\ngrown using a high pressure method [14].

This unusual FFF\nstate of MgB2 can be seen more clearly in Fig.\np3(b), in\nwhich the same data is plotted as a function of H/Hc2 .\nA crossover field Hcr which separates two distinct flux\nHkab\nflow regime with different \u03c1f\nslope is distinguishable\np\nab\nat Hcr /Hc2 \u2243 0.3, as indicated by the arrow. On the\nother hand, such a crossover cannot be easily identified\nHkc\nin \u03c1f .\nThe appearance of the crossover field can be attributed\nto the two distinct superconducting gaps.

To estimate the pinning\nfrequency of MgB2 , plots of Xs vs Rs in two configurations are shown in the inset of Fig. 2(a). For comparison,\nthe same data at several \u03c9/\u03c9p calculated from Eq.(3) are\nalso plotted. The inset of Fig. 2(a) strongly suggests that\n\u03c9/\u03c9p is much larger than unity in both configurations,\ndemonstrating that the FFF state is nearly realized in\nthe present frequency range. In the FFF state, two characteristic length scales, namely \u03bb and \u03b4f , emerge in accordance with microwave penetration. In low fields, \u03bb\ngreatly exceeds \u03b4f (\u03bb \u226b \u03b4f ). In this region, Rs and Xs\nare given by Rs \u2243 \u03c1f /\u03bb and Xs \u2243 \u03bc0 \u03c9\u03bb . In high fields\nwhere \u03b4f exceeds \u03bb(\u03b4f \u226b \u03bb), the response is similar to\nthe normal state (Rs \u2243 Xs ), except that \u03b4n is replaced\nby \u03b4f . In MgB2 , this cross over occurs at a very low\nfield (\u03bc0 H < 100 mT) in both configurations. This indicates that the influence of penetration lengths on the\nvortex dynamics is negligibly small except at very low\nfield regimes.\nHaving established that the FFF state is realized in\nthe present experiments, FFF resistivities in H paralHkc\nHkab\nlel to the c-axis and ab-plane, \u03c1f\nand \u03c1f\n, respectively, are estimated next from Figs.2(a) and (b), assumHkc\nHkab\ning \u03c9/\u03c9p = \u221e. Figure 3 (a) shows \u03c1f\nand \u03c1f\n,\nnormalized by the normal state values as a function of\nH/Hc2 at T =2.3 K (T /Tc =0.06). For comparison, the Hdependence of the FFF resistivity of single gap s-wave superconductor, as given by Eq. (1), and of d-wave Bi:2201,\nas reported in Ref.[9] are also shown. The field depenHkc\nHkab\ndence of both \u03c1f and \u03c1f\nare spectacularly different\nfrom those of s-wave and d-wave superconductors. Both\nHkc\nHkab\n\u03c1f\nand \u03c1f\nincrease steeply with H at low fields,\neven steeper than \u03c1f in d-wave superconductor.

The solid line represents the FFF resistivity of conventional s-wave superconductor expressed by Eq. (1). The\ndashed line represents the FFF resistivity in d-wave superconductor reported\nin Ref.[9]. (b) The same data plotted as\np\na function of H/Hc2 .\n\nreported in several experiments. According to STM measurements, the vortex radius is much larger than expected from Hc2 and superconductivity is strongly suppressed by a low field. Sharp increases in the heat capacity Ce [4] and thermal conductivity \u03bae [5] at low fields\nwith initial slopes much larger than in conventional swave superconductors also revealed the unusual vortex\nstate of MgB2 . In particular, in Hk ab, Ce is nearly half\nab\nof the normal state value Cen at H/Hc2\n\u223c 0.1, followed\nby a gradual increase up to Hc2 . Moreover, \u03bae in Hk ab\nbecomes nearly H-independent after \u03bae reaches nearly\nab\nhalf of the normal state value \u03ban at H/Hc2\n\u223c 0.1. These\nstrong enhancements of Ce and \u03bae at low fields has been\nattributed to the suppression of the small superconducting gap originating from the three dimensional \u03c0-band.\nTherefore, it is natural to consider that the steep increase\nand crossover behavior observed in the FFF resistivities\ncould also be attributed to the two superconducting gaps.\nIn conventional s-wave superconductors, the energy\ndissipation associated with FFF is caused by the quasiparticles trapped within vortex cores [6, 7]. Since in conventional s-wave superconductors the DOS within cores\n\n\f4\nis approximately H-independent, FFF resistivity is proportional to the number of vortices as given by Eq.(1).\nThe situation in MgB2 is very different. Below Hcr ,\nquasiparticles are trapped by both small and large gaps.\nSince the coherence lengths associated with the small gap\nare much larger than those associated with the large gap,\nthe number of quasiparticles trapped within cores well\nbelow Hcr is much larger than the number trapped solely\nby the large gap. This gives rise to strong enhancement\nof FFF resistivity at low fields. As H approaches Hcr , the\nsmall gap is strongly suppressed. As a result, the contribution of bound quasiparticles of the \u03c0-band essentially\nbecomes negligible above Hcr . This gives rise to a gentler increase in FFF resistivity above Hcr up to Hc2 . The\nkink structure observed at Hcr in Fig. 3(b) implies that\nthis crossover occurs in a narrow field range. Similar to\nHkab\nthe d-wave superconductor described by Eq.(2), \u03c1f\n\u221a\nbelow and above Hcr exhibit nearly H dependence. To\nclarify the origin of this H-dependence, more detailed information on quasiparticle structure and the dissipation\nmechanism is strongly required.\nRecently, the carrier scattering rate in the \u03c0-band\nhas been suggested [21, 22] to be much higher than in\nthe \u03c3 band. Detailed information about the quasiparticle structure and scattering rate can be extracted when\nthe heat capacity, thermal conductivity and FFF resistivity data are combined. In fact heat capacity is essentially determined by the number of the quasiparticles. On the other hand, thermal conductivity is deter-\n\nmined by delocalized quasiparticles outside vortex cores\nbecause localized quasiparticles cannot carry heat. In\ncontrast, energy dissipation in the FFF state is dominated by the quasiparticles localized within cores. We\nstress that all quantities, heat capacity, thermal conductivity, and FFF resistivity in Hk ab follow a striking similar trend; a crossover from low field to high field region\nab\noccurs at Hcr /Hc2\n\u2243 0.1 and all quantities increase up\nto nearly half of the normal state values near Hcr with\nab\nab\nCe (Hcr )/Ce (Hc2\n) \u223c 0.55, \u03ba(Hcr )/\u03ba(Hc2\n) \u223c 0.57, and\nc\nc\nab\n\u03c1f (Hcr )/\u03c1f (Hc2 ) \u223c 0.45. This implies that the carrier\nscattering rate of the \u03c3 band is close to that of \u03c0 the band.\nThis appears to be inconsistent with the suggestion by\nRef.[21, 22]. A more detailed microscopic calculation is\nneeded to evaluate the carrier scattering rate.\nIn summary, the FFF resistivity in MgB2 exhibits\nunusual field dependence, which is markedly different\nfrom conventional s-wave superconductors. Two distinct regimes in which the FFF resistivity exhibits different field dependence are observed. These unusual Hdependences indicate that two very differently sized superconducting gaps manifest in energy dissipation associated with the vortex dynamics.\nWe thank M.B. Gaifullin, N. Hayashi, Y.
