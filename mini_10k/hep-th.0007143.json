This interest is mostly due to the fact that supersymmetry\nseverely restricts the quantum corrections to the moduli space metric and allows to make many\nexact computations [1] . A large class of these gauge theories can be realized by D-brane\nconfigurations in type II strings on Calabi Yau manifolds [2, 3, 4, 5] .\nRecently, a special interest has been given to the analysis of the hypermultiplet gauge invariant\nmoduli space near the Higgs branch singularity. This analysis has been shown to be relevant for\nthe study of many aspects in supersymmetric gauge theories with eight supercharges amongst\nwhich we quote: (1) the understanding of the assymptotic regions of the infrared IR low energy\nlimits of the N = (4, 4) supersymmetric gauge theories in two dimensions especially within\nthe so called throats of the Coulomb and Higgs branches where the theories are typically\ndescribed by 2d N = 4 conformal Liouville theories [6, 7]. (2) the study of vector and\nhypermultiplet moduli spaces in the context of strings compactifications to four dimensions\nwhere the low energy supergravity has scalar fields in both vector and matter multiplets [8]\n. (3) the description of stringy instanton moduli space as hyperkahler deformations of the\nclassical instanton moduli space with non zero NS-NS B field [9, 10, 11]. (4) the rederivation\nof 2d CFT's from compactifications of superstrings on Calabi Yau fourfolds with a sp(1)\nhyperKahler singularity [12].\nThe aim of this paper is to study new aspects of hyperkahler singularities of the Higgs\nbranch of supersymmeric gauge theories with eight supercharges by using the linear sigma\nmodel method. Actually this study extends the analysis of the ADE singularities of Kahler\nmanifolds to hyperKahler ones. It also generalizes known results, on the Coulomb branch of\nsupersymetric gauge theories with four supercharges, to the Higgs branch of supersymetric\ngauge theories with eight supercharges.\nThe presentation of this paper is as follows: In section 2, we review hyperKahler singularities\nand describe brefly the standard way used in handling the D-flateness eq of supersymmetric\ntheories with eight supercharges. In section 3, we use the harmonic superspace method of\nsupersymmeric gauge theories with eight supercharges to study the problem of hyperKahler\nsingularities. This way of doing has many advantagesas first it preserves manifestly the eight\nsupercharges secon it keeps all the three FI parameters non zero without need to make any\nappropriate choice. Our method , which is based on realizing the SU(2)R invariance a by helf\n1\n\n\fharmonic analysis on S 2 , permits to exhibit explicitly the role of the three Kahler structures\nof the gauge invariant hyperkahler moduli space. In Section 4, we study the solving of the Dflateness eqs by introducing a method based on the factorization of the charges of the gauge and\nthe SU(2)R symmetries. We give two classes of solutions of these eqs preserving manifestly the\neight supercharges and recverring known resultts on ADE singularities by particular breaking\nhalf of the supersymetry. In section 5, we give our conclusion.\n\n2\n\nGeneralities on Hyperkahler singularities\nWe begin by noting that Calabi Yau fourfolds can develop singularities of many types;\n\nthis includes the\n\nC4\nZ4\n\norbifold, the ADE hypersurfaces considered recently in [12] and the so\n\ncalled hyperkahler singularity we are intersted in here. We review hereafter the example\nof the hyperkahler cotangent bundle T \u2217 (CP 2 ) of complex projective space (CP 2) and its\ngeneralisation T \u2217 (CP n ) for n > 2. To that purpose, consider 2d N = 4 supersymmetric\nU(1) gauge theory with one FI isotriplet coupling \u03be~ = (\u03be 1 , \u03be 2 , \u03be 3) and three hypermultiplets of\ncharges qai = q i = 1; i = 1, 2, 3. The moduli space of this gauge model are obtained by solving\n3\nX\n\n~\u03c3 \u03b2 ,\n[\u03c6i\u03b1 \u03c6\u03b2i + \u03c6i\u03b1 \u03c6\u03b2i ] = \u03be~\n\u03b1\n\n(2.1)\n\ni=1\n\nwhich by the way is just a special situation of the following eqs:\nn\nX\n\nqai [\u03c6\u03b1i \u03c6i\u03b2 + \u03c6i\u03b2 \u03c6\u03b1i ] = \u03be~a~\u03c3\u03b2\u03b1\n\n; a = 1, ..., r.\n\n(2.2)\n\ni=1\n\nFor later use it is interesting to note that eqs(2.2) have a formal analogy with the sigma\nmodel vaccum eqs of 2d N = 2 supersymmetric U(1)r gauge theory involved in the analysis\nof the Coulomb branch of IIA superstrings on Calabi Yau threefolds with ADE singularities.\nX\n\nqai |Xi |2 = Ra ;\n\na = 1, ..., r.\n\n(2.3)\n\ni\n\nIn eqs (2.3), the Xi 's are complex scalar fields, the Ra 's are FI couplings and the qai 's are the\nU(1)r gauge charges of the Xi 's which, for reference, read in the case of a SU(n) singularity\nas :\nqai = \u22122\u03b4ai + \u03b4ai\u22121 + \u03b4ai+1 ,\n\n(2.4)\n\nwith the remarkable equality\nX\n\nqai = 0.\n\ni\n\n2\n\n(2.5)\n\n\fEqs (2.1) is a system of three eqs which, up to replacing the Pauli matrices by their expressions\nand using the SU(2)R transformations \u03c6\u03b1 = \u03b5\u03b1\u03b2 \u03c6\u03b2 with \u03b512 = \u03b521 = 1 and (\u03c6\u03b1 ) = \u03c6\u03b1 , split as\nfollows:\n3\nP\n\n(|\u03c61i |2 \u2212 |\u03c62i |2 )\n\ni=1\n3\nP\n\ni=1\n3\nP\n\ni=1\n\n= \u03be3\n\n(a)\n\n\u03c61i \u03c6i2\n\n= \u03be 1 + i\u03be 2\n\n(b)\n\n\u03c62i \u03c6i1\n\n= \u03be 1 \u2212 i\u03be 2\n\n(c).\n\n(2.6)\n\nThe moduli space of zero energy states of the classical gauge theory is the space of the solutions\nof eqs (2.1) and (2.6) divided by the action of the U(1) gauge group. The solutions of eqs (2.1)\ndepend on the values of the FI couplings. For the case where \u03be 1 = \u03be 2 = \u03be 3 = 0, the moduli\nspace has an SU(3) \u00d7 SU(2)R symmetry; it is a cone over a seven manifold described by the\neqs:\n3\nX\n\n(\u03c6\u03b1i \u03c6\u03b2i \u2212 \u03c6\u03b2i \u03c6\u03b1i ) = \u03b4 \u03b2\u03b1 .\n\n(2.7)\n\ni=1\n\nFor the case \u03be~ =\n6 ~0, the abovementioned SU(3) \u00d7 SU(2)R symmetry is explicitly broken down\nto SU(3) \u00d7 U(1)R . In the remarkable case where \u03be 1 = \u03be 2 = 0 and \u03be 3 > 0, it is not difficult to\nsee that eqs (2.1) describe the cotangent bundle of CP 2. Indeed making the change\n\u03c61i\n\n\u03c8i =\n[\n\n3\nP\n\ni=1\n\n1\n\n,\n\n(2.8)\n\n|\u03c6i2 |2 + \u03be 3 ] 2\n\nand putting back into eq (2.6.a), one discovers that \u03c8i 's satisfy\n\nP\ni\n\n|\u03c8i |2 = 1.\n\nThe \u03c8i 's\n\nparametrize the CP 2 space. On the other hand with \u03be 1 = \u03be 2 = 0 conditions, eqs (2.6b,c) may be interpreted to mean that \u03c62i lies in the cotangent space to CP 2 at the point\ndetermined by \u03c8i . Note that though we are usually allowed to make the choice \u03be 1 = \u03be 2 = 0 by\nusing an appropriate SU(2)R transformation, we shall consider in section 4, the generic cases\nwhere \u03be 1 , \u03be 2 and \u03be 3 are all of them non zero. For the time being let us note that the previous\nanalysis may be extended to the cases of 2d N = 4 supersymmetric U(1) gauge linear sigma\nmodel involving n + 1 hypermutiplets with charges q i = 1; i = 1, ..., n + 1 and transforming\nin the fundamental representation of SU(n + 1). The vaccum energy equations of this U(1)\ngauge model read as :\nn+1\nP\n\n(|\u03c61j |2 \u2212 |\u03c62j |2 )\n\nj=1\nn+1\nP\nj=1\n\n= \u03be3\n= \u03be 1 + i\u03be 2 .\n\n(\u03c61j \u03c62j )\n3\n\n(2.9)\n\n\fFor \u03be 1 = \u03be 2 = 0 and \u03be 3 > 0, the classical moduli space of the gauge theory is given by the\ncotangent bundle of complex n projective space: T \u2217 CP n . For \u03be 1 = \u03be 2 = \u03be 3 = 0, one has just\nthe conifold singularity of n dimensional complex manifolds.\n\n3\n\nHyperkahler singularities in Harmonic superspace\nEqs(2.2) is a system of 3r equations which shares some general features with the usual 2d\n\nN = 2 supersymmetic D-flatness conditions eqs(2.3). To solve them, we shall use a different\nmethod inspired from harmonic superspace. The latter was shown to be the appropriate space\nto deal with supersymmetric quantum field theories with eight supercharges. We shall not\ndevelop here the basis of this superspace; details may be found in [13, 14]. Our approach will\nbe done in two steps: First we use SU(2)R harmonic analysis allowing us to realise SU(2)R\nrepresentations as special functions on SR2 . The index R carried by SR2 and U(1)R refers to the\nSU(2)R . Second, we introduce a convenient change of variables based on factorizing the U(1)rG\ngauge charges and the SU(2)R ones. We begin by describing the first step of this program.\nIntroducing the following 2 \u00d7 2 matrix\nU=\nand solving the isospin\n\n1\n2\n\n\u0012\n\nu+\n1\nu\u2212\n1\n\nu+\n2\nu\u2212\n2\n\n\u0013\n\n(3.1)\n\nSU(2)R representation constraints namely the unimodularity detU =\n\n+\n\n1 and the unitarity U U = U + U = I conditions, one discovers the defining eq of the unit SR3\nsphere:\nu\u00b1\u03b1 = \u01eb\u03b1\u03b2 u\u00b1\n\u03b2;\n+\u03b1 \u2212\nu u\u03b1 = 1,\n\nu+\u03b1 = u\u2212\n\u01eb\u03b1\u03b2 = \u2212\u01eb\u03b2\u03b1\n\u03b1;\n\u2212\u03b1 \u2212\n= u u\u03b1 = 0.\n\nu+\u03b1 u+\n\u03b1\n\n(3.2)\n\nMoreover, using the u\u00b1\n\u03b1 variables, the SU(2)R algebra is realized as differential operators\non the space of harmonic functions on SR3 :\nD \u2212\u2212 = u\u2212\u03b1 \u2202u\u2202+\u03b1\nD ++ = u+\u03b1 \u2202u\u2202\u2212\u03b1 ;\n2D ++ = [D 0 , D ++ ];\n\u22122D \u2212\u2212 = [D 0 , D \u2212\u2212 ]\nD 0 = [D ++ , D \u2212\u2212 ] = u+\u03b1 \u2202u\u2202+\u03b1 \u2212 u\u2212\u03b1 \u2202u\u2202\u2212\u03b1\n\n(3.3)\n\nTo study the SU(2)R representations by using the harmonic variables, it is more convenient\nq\n\u00b1\nto consider harmonic functions F q (u\u00b1\n\u03b1 ) with definte U(1)R charge q ; that is functions F (u\u03b1 )\n\nsatisfying the eigenfunction eq\n[D 0 , F q ] = qF q .\n4\n\n(3.4)\n\n\fThese functions F q have a global harmonic expansion of total charge q and carry SU(2)R\nrepresentations. For example, taking q = 2 and choosing F ++ as:\n+ + (\u03b1\u03b2)\nF ++ (u\u00b1\n,\n\u03b1 ) = u(\u03b1 u\u03b2) F\n\n(3.5)\n\none sees that F ++ is the highest state of the isovector representation of SU(2)R ;i.e:\n[D 0 , F q ] = qF q ,\n\n[D ++ , F q ] = 0.\n\nNote that one can usually realize F ++ as bilinears of isospinors f + and f\n+\n\n(3.6)\n+\n\nas follows:\n\n\u03b2)\n\n+ (\u03b1\nF ++ = if + f = iu+\n(\u03b1 u\u03b2) f f .\n\n(3.7)\n\nThe complex number i in front of the the factor of the right hand side of the above eqs ensures\nthe reality condition of the isotriplet representation. After this digression on the SU(2)R\n+\nharmonic analysis, we turn now to eqs (2.2) which up on multiplying its both sides by u+\n(\u03b1 u\u03b2) ,\n\nwe get:\nX\n\n+\n++\nqaj \u03c6+\nj \u03c6j = \u2212i\u03bea .\n\n(3.8)\n\nj\n\nEqs (3.8) are also the D-flatness eqs one gets if one is using the 2d N = (4, 4) harmonic\nsuperspace formulation of 2d N = 4 gauge theories [13, 14].\nIn the end of this section, we would like to make two comments: First one can use the\nisospinor bilinear realization of isotriplets eqs (3.7) to represent the Kahler parameters \u03bea++ as\nfollows:\n+\n\n\u03b2)\n\n+ (\u03b1\n\u03bea++ = i\u03b6a+ \u03b6 a = iu+\n(\u03b1 u\u03b2) \u03b6a \u03b6 a\n\u00b1\n\u03b1\n\u03b1\n\u03b6a\u00b1 = u\u00b1\n\u03b6 a = u\u00b1\n\u03b1 \u03b6a ;\n\u03b1 \u03b6a ,\n\n(3.9)\n\n\u03b1\n\nwhere \u03b6a\u03b1 and \u03b6 a may, roughly speaking, be viewed as the square roots of the FI couplings\n\u00b1\n\n\u03bea(\u03b1\u03b2) . Similar relations involving \u03b6a\u00b1 and \u03b6 a for \u03bea0 and \u03bea\u2212\u2212 may be also written down. Putting\nback these relations in eqs (3.8), one gets\nX\n\n+\n\n\u03b2)\n\n+\n+\n+ + (\u03b1\nqaj \u03c6+\nj \u03c6j = \u03b6a \u03b6 a = u(\u03b1 u\u03b2) \u03b6a \u03b6 a .\n\n(3.10)\n\nj\n\nSecond, simplify further eqs (3.10) by making an extra change of variables which turns out to\nconvenient when discussing the moduli space of gauge invariant vacua of eqs (2.2). This extra\nchange consists to use the mapping R3 = R+ \u00d7 S 2 to write the FI isovectors \u03bea++ as\n2 + +\n\u03bea++ = Ra \u03b7a+ \u03b7 +\na = ra \u03b7a \u03b7 a ,\n\n5\n\n(3.11)\n\n\f\u03b1\n\nor equivalently by using the isospinors \u03b6a\u03b1 and \u03b6 a introduced previously:\n\u00b1\n\n\u03b1\n\u03b6a\u00b1\n= u\u00b1\n\u03b1 \u03b6a ;\n\u03b6a\u03b1\n= ra \u03b7a\u03b1 ;\n\u03b6a\u03b1\u03b6 a\u03b1 = ra2 \u2265 0\n\n\u03b1\n\n\u03b6 a = u\u00b1\n\u03b1 \u03b6a\n\u03b1\n\u03b6 a = ra \u03b7 \u03b1a\n\n(a)\n(b)\n(c).\n\n(3.12)\n\nEqs (3.11) and (3.12) tell us that the Ra 's (Ra = ra2 \u2265 0) are the radial variables and the \u03b7a\u03b1 's\nand \u03b7 a\u03b1 's, which satisfy\n\u03b7a\u03b1 \u03b7 a\u03b1 = 1;\n\n\u03b7a\u03b1 \u03b7a\u03b1 = \u03b7 \u03b1a \u03b7a\u03b1 = 0,\n\n(3.13)\n\nparametrize the two spheres Sa2 . The ra2 and \u03b7a\u03b1 and \u03b7 a\u03b1 are in one to one correspondance with\nthe r FI isovectors. In other words eqs (3.13) describe a collection of r unit two spheres which\naltogether with the ra conical variables of (R3 )r give the 3r parameters of the r FI isovector\ncouplings.\n\n4\n\nSolving the D-flateness eqs\n\nIn this section, we solve eqs(2.2) by developing a factorization method of the gauge and\nSU(2)R charges carried by the hyperKahler moduli. This factorization should satisfy the\nfollowing natural constraints:\n(a) The splitting of the gauge and SU(2)R charges preserves the eight supercharges of the\ngauge theory.\n(b)It recovers the results of [12], extends the ADE models of Kahler backgrounds [3]and, up\non breaking half of the eight supercharges, gives the standard ADE results.\n(c) It has a geometrical interpretation.\nThe factorization of hyperKahler moduli solving the above constraints is given by:\n+\n+\n\u03c6+\nj = Xj \u03b7j + \u03b3Yj \u03b7 j\n+\n+\n\u03c6+\nj = X j \u03b7 j \u2212 \u03b3Y j \u03b7 j ,\n\n(4.1)\n\nwhere \u03b7j+ and \u03b7 +\nj are as in eqs (3.12); that is:\n\u03b1\n\u03b7j+ = u+\n\u03b1 \u03b7j ;\n\u03b7j\u03b1 \u03b7 \u03b1j = 1;\n\n+ \u03b1\n\u03b7+\nj = u\u03b1 \u03b7 j\n\u03b7j\u03b1 \u03b7\u03b1j = \u03b7 \u03b1j \u03b7 \u03b1j = 0.\n\n(4.2)\n\nIn eqs(4.1), Xj and Yj , j = 1, ..., n are complex fields carrying no SU(2)R charge. The\nparameter \u03b3 takes the values \u03b3 = 0 or \u03b3 = 1 and allow to distinguish two classes of solutions\nwe will give hereafter. Moreover the quantities Xj , Yj and \u03b7j+ and \u03b7 +\nj of eqs(4.1) behave under\n\n6\n\n\fU(1)r gauge and SU(2)R transformations as follows:\nj\n\nU(1)r : Xj \u2212\u2192 Xj\u2032 = \u03bbqa Xj\nj\nYj \u2212\u2192 Yj\u2032 = \u03bbqa yj\n+\n\u03b7j+ \u2212\u2192 \u03b7\u2032+\nj = \u03b7j\n+\n+\n\u03b7 j \u2212\u2192 \u03b7\u2032j = \u03b7 +\nj ;\n\n(4.3)\n\nU(1)R : Xj \u2212\u2192 Xj\u2032 = Xj\nYj \u2212\u2192 Yj\u2032 = Yj\ni\u03b8 +\n\u03b7j+ \u2212\u2192 \u03b7\u2032+\nj = e \u03b7j\n+\n+\n\u03b7 j \u2212\u2192 \u03b7\u2032j = ei\u03b8 \u03b7+\nj .\n\n(4.4)\n\nand\n\nActually eqs (4.3-4) define the factorization of the gauge charges and SU(2)R ones of the\nvacum moduli. In what follows we shall use the splitting eqs(4.1) to solve eqs (2.2) which, by\nhelp of the analysis of section 3, may be put in the form:\nX\n\n+\n2 + +\nqaj \u03c6+\nj \u03c6j = ra \u03b7a \u03b7 a .\n\n(4.5)\n\nj\n\nWe give herebelow two classes of solutions of these eqs. The first class describes a generalisation\nof the usual ALE surfaces with ADE singularities. The second class leads to new models which\nflow in the infrared to 2d N = (4, 4) conformal field theories.\n\n4.1\n\nGeneralized ADE hypersurfaces\n\nEqs(2.2) looks formally like eqs (2.3); their solutions are then expected to describe generalisations of the standard eqs of ADE singularities associated with 2d N = 2 linear sigma models.\nImposing the ADE Calabi Yau condition\nP\nj\n\nqaj = 0,\n\na = 1, ..., n \u2212 1,\n\n(4.6)\n\none can imitate the analysis of N = 2 linear \u03c3 models and build the gauge invariant moduli\nj\nin terms of the \u03c6+\nj fields. In the SU(n) case for instance where qa is given by eq(2.4), there\n\nare three gauge invariant moduli; U +\n\nn(n+1)\n2\n\n, V+\n\nn(n+1)\n2\n\nand Z +(n+1) carrying\n\nn(n+1)\n2\n\n,\n\nn(n+1)\n2\n\nand\n\n(n + 1) U(1)R Cartan charges respectively.

Note\n\u00b1\nthat like \u03c6\u00b1\nj , the realization Xj \u03b7j carries for each value of j, four real degrees of freedom;\n\ntwo coming from Xj and the two others from the parameters the sphere S 2 described by \u03b7j\u00b1 .\nUnder 2d N = 4 supersymmetric transformations which may be conveniently expressed as 4d\nN = 2 supersymmetric transformations of fermionic parameters \u01eb\u00b1 and \u01eb\u00b1 , we have:\n+\n+\n\u03b4\u03c6+\nj = \u01eb \u03c8j + \u01eb \u03c7j ;\n\n(4.11)\n\n\u00b1\nwhere \u03c8j and \u03c7j are the Fermi partners of the \u03c6\u00b1\nj scalars. (\u03c6j , \u03c8j , \u03c7j ) constitute altogether\n\nthe 4d N = 2 free hypermultiplets. Using the splitting principle by factorizing \u01eb+ as \u01eb\u03b7 + and\n\u01eb+ = \u01eb\u03b7+ , and using eqs (4.10-11), we get\n\u03b7j+ \u03b4Xj + Xj \u03b4\u03b7j+ = \u03b7 + \u01eb\u03c8j + \u03b7 + \u01eb\u03c7j ,\n\n(4.12)\n\n\u03b7j\u03b1 \u03b4Xj + Xj \u03b4\u03b7j\u03b1 = \u03b7 \u03b1 \u01eb\u03c8j + \u03b7\u03b1 \u01eb\u03c7j .\n\n(4.13)\n\nor equivalenty\n\nPutting eqs (4.10) back into eqs (4.5), we obtain\nX\n\n2 + +\nqaj |Xj |2 \u03b7j+ \u03b7 +\nj = ra \u03b7a \u03b7 a\n\n(4.14)\n\nj\n\nand\n\nn(n+1)\n\nn(n+1)\n\nU + 2 = uM + 2\nn(n+1)\nn(n+1)\nV + 2 = vN + 2\nZ +(n+1) = zS +(n+1) ;\n\n8\n\n(4.15)\n\n\fwhere u, v, z and M +\n\nn(n+1)\n2\n\n, N+\n\nu=\nv=\nz=\n\nn(n+1)\n2\n\nn\nQ\n\nj=0\nn\nQ\n\nj=0\nn\nQ\n\nj=0\n\nand S +(n+1) are gauge invariants given by:\n\nXjj\n\nN+\n\n;\n\nn(n+1)\n2\n\n=\n\nn\nQ\n\n(\u03b7j+ )n\u2212j\n\nj=0\n\nXjn\u2212j ;\nXj\n\nM+\n\nn(n+1)\n2\n\n=\n\n(\u03b7j+ )j\n\nj=0\nn\nQ\n\nS +(n+1)\n\n;\n\nn\nQ\n\n=\n\nj=0\n\nNote that u, v and z verify the relation (4.9) and M +\n\nn(n+1)\n2\n\n, N+\n\n(4.16)\n\n\u03b7j+ .\nn(n+1)\n2\n\nand S +(n+1) satisfy eq\n\n(4.8). Note moreover that eqs (4.14-15) may be brought to more familiar forms if one requires\nthat all 2-spheres are identified; i.e:\n(i) The (n + 1) 2- spheres parametrized by the \u03b7j 's .\n(ii) The (n \u2212 1) \u03b7a 2-spheres used in the parametrization of the FI couplings eqs (3.13).\n(iii) The \u03b7 + 2-sphere involved in the factorization of the supersymmetric parameter \u01eb+ eq(4.12).\nPut differently, we require the following constraint eq to hold:\n\u03b7j+ = \u03b7a+ = \u03b7 + .\n\n(4.17)\n\nWith this identification, eqs (4.14) reduce to the well known D- flatness conditions of the U(1)r\nsupersymmetric gauge theory with four supercharges; namely:\nX\n\nqaj |Xj |2 = ra2 .\n\n(4.18)\n\nj\n\nMoreover eq (4.8) reduces to the usual ALE surface with SU(n) singularity (4.9) since the\nM+\n\nn(n+1)\n2\n\n, N+\n\nn(n+1)\n2\n\nand S +(n+1) gauge invariant become trivial; they are given by powers of\n\n\u03b7 + as shown here below.\nn(n+1)\n\nn(n+1)\n\nM + 2 = (\u03b7 + ) 2\nS +(n+1) = (\u03b7 + )n+1 .\n\n= N+\n\nn(n+1)\n2\n\n(4.19)\n\nIn the general case where the gauge charges qaj of the Xj 's satisfy the constraints(2.5), eqs(4.18)\nis the vaccum energy of 2d N = 2 supersymmetric linear \u03c3 models. Thus, the classical moduli\nspace M of the gauge invariant vacua of eqs(4.17-18) is given by the product of the 2-sphere\nparametrized by \u03b7 + ; eq(4.17)and the moduli space of the gauge invariant solutions of 2d N = 2\nvaccum energy states. In other words:\nM=\n\nC n+1\n2\nn\u22121 \u00d7 S .\n\u2217\nC\n\nNote that the identification constraint eq(4.17) has a nice interpretation; it breaks explicitly\nhalf of the eight supersymmetries leaving then four supercharges manifest. These four supercharges are behind the reduction of eqs(4.14) down to eqs(4.18)leading to the standard ADE\n9\n\n\fmodels. This feature is immediately derived by combining eqs(4.13) and (4.17) as follows :\n\u03b7 \u03b1 \u03b4Xj + Xj \u03b4\u03b7 \u03b1 = \u03b7 \u03b1 \u01eb\u03c8j + \u03b7\u03b1 \u01eb\u03c7j .\n\n(4.20)\n\nThen multiplying both sides of this identity by \u03b7 \u03b1 ; one gets, after using eqs(4.2):\n\u03b4Xj = \u01eb\u03c8j .\n\n(4.21)\n\nThis eq gives the usual supersymmetric transformations of the complex scalars of the 2d\nN = 2 chiral multiplets. This completes our check of consistency of the generalised SU(n)\nhypersurface singularity (4.8). Before going ahead let us summarize in few words what we\nhave been doing. Starting from eqs(2.2), we have shown that it is possible to put them into\nthe equivalent form (4.5). The corresponding moduli space of gauge invaraint vacua is given\nby eq (4.8) which reduces to the standard ALE space with An\u22121 singularity up on imposing\nthe factorization eqs (4.10) and the conditions (4.17). The latters break four of the original\neight supercharges. To restore the eight supersymmetries by still using the constraint (4.17),\nwe should take \u03b3 non zero; say \u03b3 = 1. Non zero \u03b3 restores four extra supercharges which add\nto the old four existing ones carried by eq (4.10). Note in passing that a naive analysis of\neqs(4.5) suggests that the gauge invariant moduli space of vacua M of eq (4.10) is given, for\nthe generalized SU(n) singularity eq (4.8), by the usual ALE space with SU(n) singularity\ntimes the two-sphere power 2n :\nM=\n\nC n+1\n2 2n\nn\u22121 \u00d7 (S ) ,\n\u2217\nC\n\nwhere (n + 1) two spheres come from the \u03c6+\nj 's as shown in eqs (4.10) and (n \u2212 1) two spheres\ncome from the FI couplings.\n\n4.2\n\nSecond Solution\n\nPutting \u03b3 = 1 in eqs(4.1) and (4.5), we get the system of three eqs given by:\nP\nj\n\nP\n\nj\nP\nj\n\nqaj (|Xj |2 \u2212 |Yj |2 )\u03b7j+ \u03b7+\n= ra2 \u03b7a+ \u03b7+\nj\na\n\n(a)\n\nqaj (Xj Y j )\u03b7j+ \u03b7j+\n\n=0\n\n(b)\n\n+\nqaj (X j Yj )\u03b7 +\nj \u03b7j\n\n= 0.\n\n(c)\n\n10\n\n(4.22)\n\n\fAt this level no constraint on the FI couplings has been imposed yet. If moreover we require\nthat all the two sphere \u03b7j+ and \u03b7a+ are identified as in eq(4.17); the above system reduces to:\nP\nj\n\nP\nj\n\nP\nj\n\nqaj (|Xj |2 \u2212 |Yj |2 ) = ra2\n\n(a)\n\nqaj (Xj Y j )\n\n=0\n\n(b)\n\nqaj (X j Yj )\n\n= 0.\n\n(c)\n\n(4.23)\n\nEqs(4.22) have remarkable features which have nice interpretations. Though the qaj gauge\ncharges of the hypermultiplet moduli are not required to add to zero as in eq (2.5), eq (4.22.a)\nbehave exactly as the D-flatness condition of 2d N = 4 supersymmetric U(1)r gauge theory.\nThe point is that eqs(4.22.a) involve twice the number of fields of eqs(2.3), but with opposite\ncharges qaj . Put differently; eq(4.22) involve two sets of fields Xj and Yj of charge qaj and\n(\u2212qaj ) respectively. The sum of gauge charges of the Xj 's and Yj 's add automatically to zero\neventhough eq(2.5)is not fulfilled.\nX\n\nqaj +\n\nj\n\nX\n\n(\u2212qaj ) = 0.\n\n(4.24)\n\nj\n\nEqs(4.24) go beyond the constraint eqs(2.5)and so models with \u03b3 = 1 flow in the IR to 2d\nN = (4, 4) superconformal models extending the usual 2d N = (2, 2) ADE ones. Moreover\neqs(4.24) may be fulfilled in different ways; either by taking all charges qaj of the U(1)r gauge\ntheory to be positive; say qaj = 1; a = 1, ..., r; j = 1, ..., n, or part of the qaj 's are positive and\nthe remaining ones are negative. In the case of a supersymmetric U(1) gauge theory with\n(n + 1) hypermutiplets with gauge charges equal to one, eqs(4.23.a) describe a CP n manifold\nwhile eqs(4.23-b,c) which read as\nX\n\nXj Yj = 0,\n\n(4.25)\n\nj\n\ntogether with their complex conjugate, show that the Yj ,'s are in the cotangent space of CP n at\nthe point xj = Xj /[\n\nP\ni\n\n1\n\n|Yi |2 + ra2 ]\u2212 2 . Observe that in case where some of the positive charges\n\nqaj of U(1)r gauge theory are not equal to one, the corresponding moduli space is just the\ncotangent bundle of some weighted complex projective space, T \u2217 (W P n ). Obesrve moreover\nthat in the infrared limit this gauge theory flows to a 2d N = (4, 4) conformal field theory\nwith central charge C = 6n.\n\n5\n\nConclusion\n\nIn this paper we have studied the solutions of the D-flatness eqs of supersymmetric U(1)r\ngauge theories with eight supercharges by using the harmonic superspace linear sigma model\n11\n\n\fapproach . We have studied the blown up of hyperkahler singularities and shown that they\nare given by cotangent bunbles of compact weighted projective spaces. The latters depend on\nthe number of hypermultiplets and gauge supermultiplets involved in the gauge model one is\nconsidering. This examination extends the standard linear sigma model analysis performed\nfor the Kahler Coulomb branch of supersymmetric gauge theories with four supercharges. Our\nmethod, which go beyond standard analysis where only half of the eight supersymmetries are\napparent, preserves manifesty all the eight supersymmetries and is done in two steps. First\nwe have used a geometric realization of the SU(2)R symmetry to transform the D-flatness\neq in a more convenient form quite easy to handle. Second we have introduced a method of\nfactorization of gauge and SU(2)R charges of the hypermultiplet moduli. This factorisation\ninvolves an index \u03b3 taking the values \u03b3 = 0 or \u03b3 = 1 which allow to distinguish two classes\nof solutions of eqs(2.2)preserving the eight supercharges. For \u03b3 = 0, we have obtained a\ngeneralisation of the ADE complex surfaces which read in the non affine case as:\nAn\u22121 :\nDn :\nE6 :\nE7 :\nE8 :\n\nn(n+1)\n\nn(n+1)\n\nU + 2 V + 2 = [Z +(n+1) ]n\n(x++ )n + x++ (y +(n\u22121) )2 + (z +n )2 = 0\n(x+6 )2 + (y +4 )3 + (z +3 )4 = 0\n(x+9 )2 + (y +6 )3 + y +6 (z +4 )3 = 0\n(x+15 )2 + (y +10)3 + (z +6 )5 = 0.\n\n(5.1)\n\nThe above eqs reproduce the standard ADE singularities by partial breaking of 2d N = 4\nsupersymmetry down to 2d N = 2. For \u03b3 = 1, we have found new models which flow in the\ninfrared to 2d N = (4, 4) scale invariant models with central charge c= 6k.\nThis research work has been supported by the program PARS number phys 27/ 372/98\nCNR.\n\n12\n\n\fReferences\n[1] N.
