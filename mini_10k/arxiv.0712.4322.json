Then\n\n\u2217\n\nAbstract\nWe present a few subjects from physics that have one in common: the\nspectral resolution of the Laplacian.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nIf we look to nature, we observe dynamics and structure formation in various aspects. Several theories exist that explain the growth of structure quantitatively.\nOn the smallest scale, it is quantum mechanics that governs the dynamics,\nwhereas on the largest scale the evolution of our universe follows the Einstein\nfield equations.\nFor all scales and almost any kind of observation we have equations at hand\nthat quantify our findings. Many of these equations contain the spectral resolution of the Laplacian. Just think of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation. In absence of\nforces or when the potential can be transformed into the metric, the stationary Schr\u00f6dinger equation reduces to the eigenvalue equation of the Laplacian\nsubject to some boundary conditions.\nSpectral resolution has important consequences on many topics. Focusing\non a few particular subjects, we start with an example from thermodynamics\nand demonstrate the importance of the spectral density. According to Weyl's\nlaw, the spectral density in leading order does not depend on the shape of\nthe boundaries. In consequence, the properties of thermodynamic systems are\nuniversal.\nLess universal is the distribution of the eigenvalues. A central subject of\nquantum chaos is to classify the distribution of eigenvalues in dependence of\nwhether the corresponding classical system is chaotic. In an explicit example,\nwe compute the spectrum of the Laplacian numerically and confirm a conjecture\nof arithmetic quantum chaos.\nFinally, we use the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the Laplacian to compute the temperature fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background.\n\u2217 Institute\n\nof Physics, Carl-von-Ossietzky University, D-26111 Oldenburg, Germany\n\n1\n\n\f2\n\nThermodynamics\n\nThe thermodynamic properties of an ideal gas can be deduced from the logarithm of the partition function,\nX\nln Z \u2261 \u2212\u03b7\nln(1 \u2212 \u03b7ze\u2212\u03b2\u03b5\u03b1 ),\n\u03b1\n\nwhere \u03b1 stands for the quantum numbers of a single particle with energy \u03b5\u03b1 ,\n1\nz = e\u03b2\u03bc is the fugacity, \u03b2 = kT\nis the inverse temperature, and \u03b7 is the statistic\nparameter that distinguishes between bosons, \u03b7 = 1, and fermions, \u03b7 = \u22121.\nIntroducing the spectral density\nX\nd(\u03b5) :=\n\u03b4(\u03b5 \u2212 \u03b5\u03b1 )\n\u03b1\n\nthe partition function can be expressed by an integral\nZ \u221e\nln Z = \u2212\u03b7\nd(\u03b5) ln(1 \u2212 \u03b7ze\u2212\u03b2\u03b5 ) d\u03b5\n\u2212\u221e\n\nwith the advantage that it is easier to compute an integral than a sum analytically.\nExample 1 (The ideal gas inside a cube) The quantum microstate of an\nideal gas in thermal equilibrium is subject to the stationary Schr\u00f6dinger equation\nH\u03a8 = E\u03a8\nwith Dirichlet boundary conditions at x, y, z = 0 and x, y, z = L.

Do we need\nto compute the entire example again, beginning with the spectral resolution of\nthe Laplacian in a sphere?\nTheorem 1 (Weyl's law [29, 4]) If a quantum system is restricted to a finite\nvolume V in D dimensions, its level counting function\nZ E\nN (E) := #{ Ei | Ei \u2264 E} \u2261\nd(E) dE\n\u2212\u221e\n\nis asymptotically equal to\nD\n\nN (E) \u223c (2s + 1)CD V E 2\nin the semiclassical limit, E \u2192 \u221e, where\nCD =\n\nm \u0001 D2\n1\n2\n2\u03c0~\n+ 1)\n\n\u0393( D\n2\n\nis a universal constant that only depends on the dimension D, but not on the\nspecific shape of the boundary.\nWeyl's law is nice. It tells us that the results of thermodynamics are universal, i.e. they are independent of the boundary shape.\n\n3\n\nQuantum chaos\n\nIn terms of classical mechanics a system is described by specifying the values of\nits coordinates and velocities, x1 , . . . , xf and \u1e8b1 , . . . , \u1e8bf , where f is the number\nof degrees of freedom.\nIf there exist f linear independent constants of motion that are in involution\nwith each other, there is a set of canonical coordinates on the phase space, the\naction-angle variables. The action variables are constants of motion and the\nangle variables are the natural linear, periodic coordinates on the torus. The\nmotion on the torus is linear in the angle variables, and the system is called\nclassically integrable.\nIf there do not exist f linear independent constants of motion, the system is\ncalled classical non-integrable or chaotic. The dynamics is non-linear and shows\nan exponential sensitivity to initial conditions.\nBeing a limiting case of quantum mechanics, one might expect to see the\nproperties of classical mechanics in quantum theory. But it is not this simple.\nThe Schr\u00f6dinger equation is linear and there is no exponential sensitivity to\ninitial conditions. Quantum chaos relies on the behaviour of the corresponding classical system. A quantum system is called chaotic if and only if the\ncorresponding classical system is non-integrable.\n4\n\n\fCentral questions of quantum chaos concern the eigenvalue statistics and the\ndistribution of eigenvalues in the semiclassical limit.\nWe use the following assumptions: The quantum mechanical system is desymmetrised with respect to all its unitary symmetries, and whenever we examine\nthe distribution of the eigenvalues, we regard them on the scale of the mean\nlevel spacings. Moreover, it is believed that after desymmetrisation a generic\nquantum Hamiltonian possesses no degenerate eigenvalues.\nConjecture 1 (Berry, Tabor [6]) If the corresponding classical system is integrable, the eigenvalues behave like independent random variables and the distribution of the nearest-neighbour spacings is close to the Poisson distribution,\ni.e. there is no level repulsion.\nConjecture 2 (Bohigas, Giannoni, Schmit [8, 9]) If the corresponding classical system is chaotic, the eigenvalues are distributed like the eigenvalues of\nhermitian random matrices. The corresponding ensembles depend only on the\nsymmetries of the system:\n\u2022 For chaotic systems without time-reversal invariance the distribution of\nthe eigenvalues should be close to the distribution of the Gaussian Unitary\nEnsemble (GUE) which is characterised by a quadratic level repulsion.\n\u2022 For chaotic systems with time-reversal invariance and integer spin the\ndistribution of the eigenvalues should be close to the distribution of the\nGaussian Orthogonal Ensemble (GOE) which is characterised by a linear\nlevel repulsion.\n\u2022 For chaotic systems with time-reversal invariance and half-integer spin\nthe distribution of the eigenvalues should be close to the distribution of the\nGaussian Symplectic Ensemble (GSE) which is characterised by a quartic\nlevel repulsion.\nThese conjectures are very well confirmed by numerical calculations, but several\nexceptions are known. Here are two examples:\nException 1 The harmonic oscillator is classically integrable, but its spectrum\nis equidistant.\nException 2 The geodesic motion on surfaces with constant negative curvature provides a prime example for classical chaos. In some cases, however,\nthe nearest-neighbour distribution of the eigenvalues of the Laplacian on these\nsurfaces appears to be Poissonian.\nConjecture 3 (Arithmetic Quantum Chaos [7, 10]) On surfaces of constant negative curvature that are generated by arithmetic fundamental groups,\nthe distribution of the eigenvalues of the quantum Hamiltonian are close to the\nPoisson distribution. Due to level clustering small spacings occur comparably\noften.\n5\n\n\fIn the next sections, we compute numerically the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the Laplacian that describe the quantum mechanics of a point particle\nmoving freely in the non-integrable three-dimensional hyperbolic space of constant negative curvature generated by the Picard group. The Picard group is\narithmetic and we find that our results are in accordance with the conjecture of\narithmetic quantum chaos.\n\n4\n\nThe modular surface\n\nFor simplicity we first introduce the topology and geometry of the two-dimensional\nsurface of constant negative curvature that is generated by the modular group\n[26]. It will then be easy to carry over to the three-dimensional space of constant\nnegative curvature that is generated by the Picard group.\nThe construction begins with the upper half-plane,\nH = {(x, y) \u2208 R2 ,\n\ny > 0},\n\nequipped with the hyperbolic metric of constant negative curvature\nds2 =\n\ndx2 + dy 2\n.\ny2\n\nA free particle on the upper half-plane moves along geodesics, which are\nstraight lines and semicircles perpendicular to the x-axis, respectively. Expressing a point (x, y) \u2208 H as a complex number z = x + iy, all isometries of the\nhyperbolic metric are given by the group of linear fractional transformations,\nz 7\u2192 \u03b3z =\n\naz + b\n,\ncz + d\n\na, b, c, d \u2208 R,\n\nad \u2212 bc = 1,\n\nwhich is isomorphic to the group of matrices\n\u0012\n\u0013\na b\n\u03b3=\n\u2208 SL(2, R),\nc d\nup to a common sign of the matrix entries,\nSL(2, R)/{\u00b11} = PSL(2, R).\nIn analogy to the concept of a fundamental cell in a regular lattice of a crystal\nwe can introduce a fundamental domain of a discrete group \u0393 \u2282 PSL(2, R).\nDefinition 1 A fundamental domain of the discrete group \u0393 is an open subset\nF \u2282 H with the following conditions: The closure of F meets each orbit \u0393z =\n{\u03b3z, \u03b3 \u2208 \u0393} at least once, F meets each orbit \u0393z at most once, and the boundary\nof F has Lebesgue measure zero.\n\n6\n\n\fIf we choose the group \u0393 to be the modular group,\n\u0393 = PSL(2, Z),\nwhich is generated by a translation and an inversion,\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1 1\n0 \u22121\n: z 7\u2192 z + 1\nand\n: z 7\u2192 \u2212z \u22121 ,\n0 1\n1 0\nthe fundamental domain of standard shape is\nF = {z = x + iy \u2208 H,\n\n\u2212\n\n1\n1\n<x< ,\n2\n2\n\n|z| > 1}.\n\nThe isometric copies of the fundamental domain \u03b3F , \u03b3 \u2208 \u0393, tessellate the\nupper half-plane completely without any overlap or gap. Identifying the fundamental domain F and parts of its boundary with all its isometric copies\n\u03b3F , \u2200\u03b3 \u2208 \u0393, defines the topology to be the quotient space \u0393\\H. The quotient\nspace \u0393\\H can also be thought of as the fundamental domain F with its faces\nglued according to the elements of the group \u0393.\nAny function being defined on the upper half-plane that is invariant under\nlinear fractional transformations,\nf (z) = f (\u03b3z) \u2200\u03b3 \u2208 \u0393,\ncan be identified with a function living on the quotient space \u0393\\H and vice\nversa.\nWith the hyperbolic metric the quotient space \u0393\\H inherits the structure of\nan orbifold. An orbifold locally looks like a manifold, with the exception that\nit is allowed to have elliptic fixed-points.\nThe orbifold of the modular group has one parabolic and two elliptic fixedpoints,\n\u221a\n3\n1\n.\nz = i\u221e, z = i, and z = + i\n2\n2\nThe parabolic one fixes a cusp at z = i\u221e which is invariant under the parabolic\nelement\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1 1\n.\n0 1\nHence, the orbifold of the modular group is non-compact.

Thus, one has to approximate them numerically. By making use of\nthe Hecke operators and the multiplicative relations among the coefficients, Steil\n[25] obtained a non-linear system of equations which allowed him to compute\n2545 consecutive eigenvalues. In [28], we extend these computations with the\nuse of a variant of Hejhal's algorithm [14]. Our favourite explanation of the\nalgorithm is published in [27].\n\n6\n\nResults\n\nThe modular surface, i.e. the two-dimensional hyperbolic orbifold that is generated by the modular group, has a reflection symmetry. This reflection symmetry\ncommutes with the Laplacian. Consequently, the eigenfunctions fall into two\nsymmetry classes. We call an eigenfunction to be even or odd depending on\nwhether f (\u2212x + iy) = f (x + iy) or f (\u2212x + iy) = \u2212f (x + iy) holds. We also call\nthe corresponding eigenvalue to be even or odd, respectively.\nIn table 1, the first ten consecutive even and the first ten consecutive odd\neigenvalues of the Laplacian on the modular surface are listed.\nThe Picard surface, i.e. the three-dimensional hyperbolic orbifold that is\ngenerated by the Picard group, has two symmetries such that the eigenfunctions\nof the Laplacian fall into four symmetry classes.

It is\nthe light that comes from the time when the universe was 379 000 years old. It\nwas predicted by Gamow in 1948 and explained in detail by Peebles [21]. In\n1978, Penzias and Wilson won the Nobel Prize of Physics for first measuring\nthe CMB at a wavelength of 7.35 cm. Within the resolution of their experiment\nthey found the CMB to be completely isotropic over the whole sky. Later with\nthe much better resolution of the NASA satellite mission Cosmic Background\nExplorer (COBE), Smoot et al. [23] found fluctuations in the CMB which are of\namplitude 10\u22125 relative to the mean background temperature of T0 = 2.725 K,\nexcept for the large dipole moment, see figure 2, resulting in the Nobel Prize\nfor Mather and Smoot in 2006. The small fluctuations in the CMB serve as a\nfingerprint of the early universe, since the temperature fluctuations are related to\nthe density fluctuations at the time of last scattering. They show how isotropic\nthe universe was at early times. In the inflationary scenario the fluctuations\noriginate from quantum fluctuations which are inflated to macroscopic scales.\nDue to gravitational instabilities the fluctuations grow steadily and give rise to\nthe formation of stars and galaxies.\nThe theoretical framework in which the CMB and its fluctuations are explained is Einstein's general theory of relativity. Thereby a homogeneous and\nisotropic background given by a Robertson-Walker universe [12, 13, 16] is perturbed. The time-evolution of the perturbations can be computed in the framework of linear perturbation theory [5].\nAn explanation for the presence of the CMB is the following, see also figure\n3: We live in an expanding universe. At early enough times the universe was so\nhot and dense that it was filled with a hot plasma consisting of ionised atoms,\n15\n\n\fFigure 2: Sky maps of the temperature fluctuations in the CMB as observed by\nthe NASA satellite mission COBE. The sky map on the top shows the dipole\nanisotropy after the mean background temperature of T0 = 2.725 K has been\nsubtracted. The amplitude of the dipole anisotropy is about 3 mK. Also subtracting the dipole yields the sky map in the middle. One sees the small temperature fluctuations whose amplitude is roughly 30 \u03bcK. But one also sees a lot\nof foreground contamination along the equator that comes from nearby stars in\nour galaxy. After removing the foregrounds one finally gets the sky map on the\nbottom showing the temperature fluctuations in the CMB.

Due to Thomson scattering of photons with\nelectrons, the hot plasma was in thermal equilibrium and the mean free path of\nthe photons was small, hence the universe was opaque. Due to its expansion the\nuniverse cooled down and became less dense. When the universe was around\n379 000 years old, its temperature T has dropped down to approximately 3000 K.\nAt this time, called the time of last scattering, the electrons got bound to the\nnuclei forming a gas of neutral atoms, mainly hydrogen and helium, and the\nuniverse became transparent. Since this time the photons travel freely on their\ngeodesics through the universe. At the time of last scattering the photons had an\nenergy distribution according to a Planck spectrum with temperature of nearly\n3000 K. The further expansion of the universe redshifted the photons such that\nthey nowadays have an energy distribution according to a Planck spectrum with\ntemperature of T0 = 2.725 K. This is what we observe as the CMB.\nDue to the thermal equilibrium before the time of last scattering the CMB is\nnearly perfectly isotropic, but small density fluctuations lead to small temperature fluctuations. The reason for the small temperature fluctuations comes from\na variety of effects. The most dominant effects are the gravitational redshift that\nis larger in the directions of overdense regions, a small time delay in the transition from opaque to transparent that slightly reduces the Hubble redshift in\nthe directions of overdense regions, the intrinsic temperature fluctuations, and\nthe Doppler effect due to the velocity of the plasma.\n\n17\n\n\f8\n\nRobertson-Walker universes\n\nAssuming a universe whose spatial part is locally homogeneous and isotropic,\nits metric is given by the Robertson-Walker metric,\nds2 = dt2 \u2212 \u00e32 (t)\u03b3ij dxi dxj ,\nwhere we use the Einstein summation convention. Notice that we have changed\nthe notation. Instead of the quaternion z for the spatial variables, we now write\nx = x0 + ix1 + jx2 . \u03b3ij is the metric of a homogeneous and isotropic threedimensional space, and the units are rescaled such that the speed of light is\ndt\nc = 1.

G is\nNewton's gravitational constant, T\u03bd\u03bc is the energy-momentum tensor, and \u039b is\nthe cosmological constant.\nAssuming the energy and matter in the universe to be a perfect fluid consisting of radiation, non-relativistic matter, and a cosmological constant, the\ntime-time component of the energy-momentum tensor reads\nT00 = \u03b5r (\u03b7) + \u03b5m (\u03b7),\nwhere the energy densities of radiation and matter scale like\n\u03b5r (\u03b7) = \u03b5r (\u03b70 )\n\na(\u03b70 ) \u00014\na(\u03b7)\n\nand \u03b5m (\u03b7) = \u03b5m (\u03b70 )\n\na(\u03b70 ) \u00013\n.\na(\u03b7)\n\nHere \u03b70 denotes the conformal time at the present epoch.\nSpecifying the initial conditions (Big Bang!) a(0) = 0, a\u2032 (0) > 0, the Friedmann equation can be solved analytically [3],\n\u00011\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u03a9r 2 \u2032\n1\n\u2212 \u03a9\nP (\u03b7) + 12 \u03a9\u03a9mc P(\u03b7) \u2212 12\nc\na(\u03b70 ),\na(\u03b7) =\n\u0001\n1 2\n\u039b \u03a9r\n\u2212 21 \u03a9\u03a9\n2 P(\u03b7) \u2212 12\n2\nc\n\nwhere P(\u03b7) \u2261 P(\u03b7; g2 , g3 ) denotes the Weierstrass P-function.

But obviously, we\ndo not live in a universe that is perfectly homogeneous and isotropic. We see\nindividual stars, galaxies, and in between large empty space. Knowing the\nspacetime of the Robertson-Walker universe, we can study small perturbations\naround the homogeneous and isotropic background. Since the amplitude of the\nlarge scale fluctuations in the universe is of relative size 10\u22125 , we can use linear\nperturbation theory. In longitudinal gauge the most general scalar perturbation\nof the Robertson-Walker metric reads\n\u0002\n\u0003\nds2 = a2 (\u03b7) (1 + 2\u03a6)d\u03b7 2 \u2212 (1 \u2212 2\u03a8)\u03b3ij dxi dxj ,\nwhere \u03a6 = \u03a6(\u03b7, x) and \u03a8 = \u03a8(\u03b7, x) are functions of spacetime.\nAssuming that the energy and matter density in the universe can be described by a perfect fluid, consisting of radiation, non-relativistic matter, and a\ncosmological constant, and neglecting possible entropy perturbations, the Einstein equations reduce in first order perturbation theory [20] to\n\u03a6 = \u03a8,\n\u0001\n\u03a6\u2032\u2032 + 3\u0124(1 + c2s )\u03a6\u2032 \u2212 c2s \u2206\u03a6 + 2\u0124 \u2032 + (1 + 3c2s )(\u0124 2 + 1) \u03a6 = 0,\n\u2032\n\nwhere \u0124 = aa and c2s = (3 + 49 \u03b5\u03b5mr )\u22121 are given by the solution of the nonperturbed Robertson-Walker universe. In the partial differential equation for\n\u03a6 the Laplacian occurs. If the initial and the boundary conditions of \u03a6 are\nspecified, the time-evolution of the metric perturbations can be computed.\nWith the separation ansatz\nZ\nX\n\u03a6(\u03b7, x) =\nfk (\u03b7)\u03c8k (x) + dk fk (\u03b7)\u03c8k (x),\nk\n\nwhere the \u03c8k are the eigenfunctions of the negative Laplacian, and the Ek are\nthe corresponding eigenvalues,\n\u2212\u2206\u03c8k (x) = Ek \u03c8k (x),\n19\n\n\fthe partial differential equation for \u03a6 simplifies to\n\u0001\nfk\u2032\u2032 (\u03b7) + 3\u0124(1 + c2s )fk\u2032 (\u03b7) + c2s Ek + 2\u0124 \u2032 + (1 + 3c2s )(\u0124 2 + 1) fk (\u03b7) = 0.\n\nThese ordinary differential equations (one for each eigenvalue Ek ) can be computed numerically in a straightforward way, and we finally obtain the metric\nof the whole universe. This gives the input to the Sachs-Wolfe formula which\nconnects the metric perturbations with the temperature fluctuations,\nZ \u03b70\n\u03b4T\n\u2202\n3\nd\u03b7\n(n\u0302) = 2\u03a6(\u03b7SLS , x(\u03b7SLS )) \u2212 \u03a6(0, x(0)) + 2\n\u03a6(\u03b7, x(\u03b7)),\nT0\n2\n\u2202\u03b7\n\u03b7SLS\nwhere n\u0302 is a unit vector in the direction of the observed photons. x(\u03b7) is the\ngeodesic along which the light travels from the surface of last scattering (SLS)\ntowards us, and \u03b7SLS is the time of last scattering.\nIf we choose the topology of the universe to be the Picard surface, we can\nuse the Maass waveforms of sections 5 and 6 in the separation ansatz for the\nmetric perturbations \u03a6. Let us further choose the initial conditions to be\n\u03c3k \u03b1\nfk (0) = p \u221a\nEk Ek \u2212 1\n\nand fk\u2032 (0) =\n\n\u2212\u03a9m fk (0)\n1\n\n16(\u03a9c \u03a9r ) 2\n\n,\n\n[3], which carry over to a Harrison-Zel'dovich spectrum. \u03b1 is a constant independent of k which is fitted to the amplitude of the observed temperature\nfluctuations. The quantities \u03c3k are normal distributed random numbers.\nThe following cosmological parameters are used \u03a9m = 0.3, \u03a9\u039b = 0.65, \u03a9c =\n1 \u2212 \u03a9tot = 1 \u2212 \u03a9r \u2212 \u03a9m \u2212 \u03a9\u039b , H(\u03b70 ) = 100 h0 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 with h0 = 0.65. The\ndensity \u03a9r \u2248 10\u22124 is determined by the current temperature T0 = 2.725 K. The\npoint of the observer is chosen to be at xobs = 0.2 + 0.1i + 1.6j. For numerical\nreasons the infinite spectrum is cut such that only the discrete eigenvalues with\nEk = k 2 + 1 \u2264 19601 and their corresponding eigenfunctions are taken into\naccount. The necessary computations are carried out in [1]. The resulting sky\nmap is shown in figure 4.\nConcerning the topology of the universe which manifests itself in the suppression of power in the large scale anisotropies, there exist the cosmological\nobservations from COBE and WMAP. In order to quantitatively compare our\nresults with these observations, we introduce the two-point correlation function,\nC(\u03b8) = \u03b4T (n\u0302)\u03b4T (n\u0302\u2032 )\n\ncos \u03b8=n\u0302*n\u0302\u2032\n\n.\n\nFigure 5 shows the correlation function corresponding to the calculated sky\nmap of the Picard surface [2] in comparison with the results of the cosmological\nobservations [24] and with the concordance model [24].\nWe find quite good agreement of our calculated temperature fluctuations\nwith the cosmological observations, whereas the results of the concordance\nmodel is not in good agreement with the data for \u03b8 & 7\u25e6 . Especially for large\nangular separations, \u03b8 & 160\u25e6 , the concordance model is not able to describe the\nobserved anticorrelation in C(\u03b8). This anticorrelation constitutes a fingerprint\nin the CMB that favours a non-trivial topology for the universe.\n20\n\n\fFigure 4: The sky map of the calculated temperature fluctuations of the CMB\nfor \u03a9tot = 0.95, \u03a9m = 0.3, \u03a9\u039b = 0.65, h0 = 0.65, and xobs = 0.2 + 0.1i + 1.6j, if\nthe discrete spectrum with Ek = k 2 + 1 \u2264 19601 is taken into account.
