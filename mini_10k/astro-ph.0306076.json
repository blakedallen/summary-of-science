Much progress has taken place where the large and\nincreasing body of observed stellar abundances (e.g., Edvardsson et al. 1993; McWilliam\net al. 1995; Ryan et al. 1996; Reddy et al. 2003) is complemented by the ongoing refinement\nof Galactic chemical evolution models (e.g. Timmes et al. 1995; Goswami & Prantzos 2000;\nAlib\u00e9s et al. 2001). The ultimate objective of Galactic chemical evolution studies is to be\nable to predict accurately elemental and isotopic abundances for any given location and\ntime. The spectra of cool stars show molecular bands from which measurements of isotopic\nabundance ratios can be made (e.g., Mg from MgH, Ti from TiO). These isotopic ratios offer\na unique opportunity to test models of Galactic chemical evolution since different stellar sites\nand nucleosynthetic processes may be responsible for production of the individual isotopes.\n\n\f\u20132\u2013\nComparing the observed and predicted evolution of isotopic abundances will test aspects of\nthe contributions of stellar nucleosynthesis to Galactic chemical evolution in a way that is just\nnot possible with elemental abundances. In order to measure isotopic ratios from molecular\nlines, cool subdwarfs (unevolved metal-poor stars that are located below the solar-metallicity\nmain sequence in color-magnitude diagrams) must first be found.\nPrevious studies such as Ryan (1989) and Carney et al. (1994) drew candidate subdwarfs\nfrom proper-motion catalogs and were successful in identifying large numbers of metal-poor\nstars. Subsequent detailed abundance analyses were carried out on these targets. Both\nstudies focused upon warmer targets, neglecting cooler subdwarfs. Objective prism surveys\nwhich identify metal-poor stars by the weakening of Ca ii H and K have also been successful\nin identifying considerable numbers of metal-poor stars (e.g., Bond 1970; Beers et al. 1992;\nChristlieb 2000). Without a reliable temperature estimate, a cool metal-poor star will have\nCa ii lines comparable to a warmer metal-rich star thereby biasing the sample towards\nwarmer stars. Numerous stars of spectral type M and later have recently been identified (e.g.,\nDelfosse et al. 1999, Hawley et al. 2002, Reid & Cruz 2002). However, the overwhelming\nmajority of these cool stars are solar metallicity. Only a handful of metal-poor stars with\nspectral type M or later have been found (e.g., Gizis 1997, Schweitzer et al. 1999, L\u00e9pine\net al. 2003, and Burgasser et al. 2003). Our target stars are cooler than those found by Ryan\n(1989) and warmer than those found by Gizis (1997).\nIn Paper I (Yong & Lambert 2003), we presented the results from our first search for cool\nsubdwarfs. From these subdwarfs we have measured the evolution of the Mg isotopic ratios,\nextending the Gay & Lambert (2000) measurements to [Fe/H]=\u22122.5 (Yong & Lambert in\nprep). In this paper, we present the results from our second search for cool subdwarfs,\nself-consistent stellar (Teff , log g, [Fe/H], and \u03bet ) and kinematic (U, V, W) parameters for a\nfurther 91 candidates.\n\n2.\n\nSelection criteria\n\nIn Paper I, our goal was to identify subdwarfs with Teff < 4700K and [Fe/H] < \u22121.5,\nthat is, metal-poor stars with MgH molecular features. Following Ryan (1989), we drew\ncandidates from the New Luyten Two-Tenths (NLTT) catalog of stars with annual propernotions in excess of 0.\u2032\u2032 18/year (Luyten 1979,1980; Luyten & Hughes 1980). We used the\nreduced proper-motion criterion to ensure that the selected stars had large transverse velocities relative to the local standard of rest. Since halo stars are on plunging orbits, they are\nover-represented in proper-motion catalogs. Hertzsprung first introduced the concept of the\nreduced proper-motion, defined as H = V + 5 log \u03bc + 5, where V is the apparent magnitude\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\nand \u03bc is the proper-motion in arcsec/year. The reduced proper-motion can also be expressed\nas H = MV + 5 log \u03bdT \u2212 3.37 where MV is the absolute magnitude and \u03bdT is the transverse\nvelocity in km/s. At a given spectral type, a reduced proper-motion constraint rejects stars\nwhose transverse velocities fall below a chosen value. Subdwarfs are less luminous than disk\ndwarfs at a given color and have larger transverse velocities. Both of these factors lead to an\nincrease in the reduced proper-motion of the subdwarf population relative to the disk dwarf\npopulation. While our original search, Paper I, was successful in finding these subdwarfs,\nour efficiency was less than ideal. Of our 134 candidates, only 11 stars had [Fe/H] < \u22121.5\nand MgH lines.\nFor this search, we again utilized the reduced proper-motion criterion to identify metalpoor stars drawn from the NLTT catalog. Instead of relying upon Luyten's original photometry, we made use of the excellent work by Salim & Gould (2002, 2003) and Gould & Salim\n(2003). Salim & Gould cross-referenced the NLTT catalog with 2MASS (Skrutskie et al.\n1997) and USNO-A (Monet et al. 1998) to obtain optical and infrared photometry. Propermotions were determined from the difference in positions between the two catalogs. Salim\n& Gould (2002) then constructed an optical-infrared reduced proper-motion diagram from\nwhich they identify \"distinct tracks for white dwarfs, subdwarfs, and main-sequence stars\".\nA reduced proper-motion diagram based on the original Luyten photometry does not show\nthe expected separation between subdwarfs and main-sequence stars. Salim & Gould suggest\nthat the reduced proper-motion diagram based on the original Luyten photometry suffers\nfrom a \"short color baseline and large errors\". In Paper I, we confirmed the Ryan (1989)\nstatement that the photometric \"values tabulated in the NLTT catalog must be regarded as\napproximate only\". Another advantage of the optical-infrared reduced proper-motion diagram is that the colors provide an accurate estimate of the effective temperature. In Figure\n1, we show a reduced proper-motion diagram identical to that of Salim & Gould with one exception. Rather than using V + 5 log \u03bc, we use J + 5 log \u03bc as the reduced proper-motion. The\nrationale is that the 2MASS photometry is more accurate than USNO. Using photographic\nplates, the principal objective of the USNO catalog is astrometry while the photometry is a\nby-product. USNO-A provides BU and RU magnitudes which are converted to V according\nto the relation given in Salim & Gould (2000) V = RU + 0.23 + 0.32(B \u2212 R)U . Salim &\nGould (2003) show that the uncertainties in V are around 0.25 mag while uncertainties in\nJ are around 0.02 mag. However, there are no discernable differences between the original\n(V + 5 log \u03bc) reduced proper-motion diagram and ours (J + 5 log \u03bc). The locations of white\ndwarfs, subdwarfs, and main-sequence stars (solar metallicity) can be easily estimated.\nOf the stars we observed in Paper I, a subset had optical and infrared photometry\nfrom Salim & Gould (2002, 2003). After constructing a reduced proper-motion diagram,\nwe overplotted the stars we observed in Paper I. It was clear that the metal-poor stars\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\nwere separated from the metal-rich stars. For this search, we selected stars with HJ \u2265\n4 + 2 \u00d7 (V \u2212 J) where HJ = J + 5 log \u03bc with V and J taken from Salim & Gould (2002,\n2003). This cutoff was the approximate line dividing the subdwarfs from the main sequence\nstars studied in Paper I. To ensure we observed cool stars, we generally observed targets\nwhich had 1.4 < V \u2212 J < 2.6. The magnitude limit was V \u2264 13.9, the limit of the\nMcDonald 2.7m telescope. We also imposed a declination limit \u221240o \u2264 \u03b4 \u2264 90o appropriate\nfor McDonald observatory. This resulted in a list of 470 candidate subdwarfs.\nIn Paper I, the most metal-poor star we observed which showed MgH lines was G39-36,\nTeff =4200K and [Fe/H]=\u22122.5. Not only did this star have a large reduced proper-motion,\nit was also marked by a large ultraviolet excess, \u03b4(U \u2212 B)0.6 = 0.25 (Sandage & Kowal\n1986). Roman (1955) found a correlation between the ultraviolet excess and the strength\nof metallic lines in high velocity stars. Schwarzschild et al. (1955) showed that a lower\nmetal abundance and the corresponding reduction in line blanketing was responsible for the\nultraviolet excess (see also Carney 1979 and references within). Therefore, we also observed\ncool stars with large ultraviolet excesses taken from Sandage & Kowal (1986). Finally,\nbright solar metallicity stars expected to have strong MgH lines were also added to the list\nof candidates to be observed. These bright stars were taken from the Hipparcos catalog\n(ESA 1997) and from Carney et al. (1994). In total we observed 91 targets; 58 selected from\nthe V \u2212 J reduced proper-motion diagram, 24 bright targets, and 9 from (Sandage & Kowal\n1986).\n\n3.\n\nObservations and data reduction\n\nTable 1 contains the list of candidates observed at McDonald Observatory on the 2.7m\nHarlan J. Smith telescope between September 2002 and February 2003. The data were\nobtained using the cross-dispersed echelle spectrometer (Tull et al. 1995) at the coud\u00e9 f/32.5\nfocus with a resolving power of either 30,000 or 60,000. The detector was a Tektronix\nCCD with 24 \u03bcm2 pixels in a 2048 \u00d7 2048 format. Using this setting, the spectral coverage\nwas from 3800\u00c5 to 8900\u00c5 with gaps between the orders beyond 5800\u00c5. These observations\nincorporated the MgH A \u2212 X lines near 5140\u00c5. Visual inspection of the data indicated the\npresence or absence of MgH molecular features. Of our sample of 91 stars, 14 stars did not\nshow MgH lines and 77 stars showed MgH lines. Numerous Fe i and Fe ii lines were available\nin the observed spectra for spectroscopic determination of the stellar parameters. For each\nstar, exposure times were generally 20-30 minutes and multiple exposures were taken and\nco-added to increase the signal-to-noise ratio when necessary. Although varying from star\nto star, the typical signal-to-noise ratio of the extracted one dimensional spectra was 60 per\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\npixel at 6500\u00c5. One dimensional wavelength calibrated normalized spectra were extracted in\nthe standard way using the IRAF1 package of programs. Equivalent widths were measured\nusing IRAF where in general Gaussian profiles were fit to the observed profile.\n\n4.\n4.1.\n\nAnalysis\n\nDeriving stellar parameters\n\nWe determined the stellar parameters using the same method described in Paper I. The\nlocal thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) stellar line analysis program Moog (Sneden 1973)\nwas used in combination with the adopted model atmosphere. For log g > 3.5, we used the\nNextgen model atmosphere grid for low mass stars computed by Hauschildt et al. (1999).\nFor giants with log g \u2264 3.5 we used LTE model atmospheres computed by Kurucz (1993).\nIn both cases we interpolated within the grid when necessary. Equivalent widths (EWs) of\n35 Fe i lines and 5 Fe ii lines were measured. The gf values of the lines were taken from\nLambert et al. (1996) and from a compilation by R.E. Luck (1993, private communication).\nThe effective temperature (Teff ) was set by insisting that the abundances of individual Fe\nlines be independent of lower excitation potential. Ideally, the Alonso et al. (1996, 1999)\nTeff :[Fe/H]:color relations based on the infrared flux method would be used to obtain values\nfor Teff . In particular, the (V \u2212 K) color provides the greatest accuracy. Unfortunately, for\n[Fe/H]\u2264 \u22121.5, the Alonso et al. (1996) (V \u2212K) relation is only applicable above Teff \u22434600K\nand Salim & Gould (2003) have shown that errors in V are 0.25 mag. The microturbulence\n(\u03bet ) was set by requiring that the abundances of individual Fe lines show no trend against\nequivalent width. By forcing agreement between the Fe abundance derived from neutral and\nionized lines, the gravity (log g) was fixed. This process required iteration until a consistent\nset of parameters were obtained (see Figure 2) from which the Fe abundance was determined\nfrom the mean of all Fe lines.\nOnly weak lines, EWs < 90 m\u00c5, were used in the analysis if possible. We observed the\nsolar spectrum at R=60,000 to check our analysis techniques. We measured 30 Fe i lines and\n7 Fe ii lines and compared our equivalent widths with the Grevesse & Sauval (1999) values.\nOur equivalent widths were larger by a mean value of 3.7 m\u00c5 with a standard deviation\nof 2.6 m\u00c5. We note that our equivalent widths were measured from a disk integrated solar\nspectrum whereas the Grevesse & Sauval (1999) equivalent widths were measured at disk\n1\n\nIRAF is distributed by the National Optical Astronomy Observatories, which are operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under cooperative agreement with the National\nScience Foundation.\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\ncenter from the Delbouille et al. (1973) solar atlas. Using our equivalent widths and a\nNextgen model atmosphere, we derived a solar abundance of log\u01eb(Fe)= 7.54. Considering\nthe Grevesse & Sauval (1999) value of log\u01eb(Fe)= 7.50 \u00b1 0.05 derived from their empirical\nmodel solar atmosphere, we adopted log\u01eb(Fe)= 7.52 as the solar Fe abundance for this study.\nThe derived model parameters have uncertainties which were estimated in the following\nway. We varied Teff until the trends between lower excitation potential and abundance\nwere unacceptable. Likewise, we changed the microturbulence until the trends between\nequivalent width and abundance were poor. The gravity was adjusted until the difference\nbetween the abundance from Fe i and Fe ii lines was greater than the standard deviation of\nthe Fe abundance derived from Fe i lines (typically 0.1\u22120.15 dex). Estimated uncertainties\nin the model parameters are \u03b4Teff =150K, \u03b4log g=0.3 dex, \u03b4\u03bet =0.3 km s\u22121 , and \u03b4[Fe/H]=0.2\ndex. Though the targets were fainter than those in Paper I, we increased the number of\nexposures to ensure the signal-to-noise ratio was similar. And so the uncertainties in the\nmodel parameters are identical to those in Paper I.\n\n4.2.\n\nComparison with literature\n\nA search on SIMBAD indicated that 10 stars had previously determined temperatures\nand 17 stars had previously determined metallicities. In Table 2, we compare our values\nwith those found in the literature. Combining our data with Paper I, we find a mean\noffset hTeff (Yong & Lambert)\u2212Teff (literature)i = \u221216 K with a standard deviation of 115K\n(see Figure 3). Again combining our data with Paper I, the mean offset is h[Fe/H] (Yong\n& Lambert)\u2212[Fe/H] (literature)i = \u22120.06 dex with a standard deviation of 0.38 dex (see\nFigure 4). There is a reasonable agreement between the stellar parameters derived in this\nstudy (and Paper I) and the values found in a variety of sources in the literature.\n\n4.3.\n\nSelf-consistency check\n\nMolecular lines will not be visible in the spectra of stars with sufficiently high temperatures and/or low abundances. A simple self-consistency test of our stellar parameters is to\npredict the limit in temperature and metallicity at which molecular lines will not be observed.\nOnce a detection limit is obtained, we can then check the stellar parameters to determine\nwhether molecular lines should or should not be present. We synthesized representative MgH\nand TiO lines assuming a resolving power of 60,000 and log g = 4.5. The MgH molecular\ndata were taken from Gay & Lambert (2000) while the TiO molecular data were taken from\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\nJ\u00f8rgensen (1994). Values of [Ti/Fe] and [Mg/Fe] in accord with observed trends summarized\nin Alib\u00e9s et al. (2001) were assumed, i.e., [Mg/Fe]=0.4 at [Fe/H]=\u22121.5. At a given value\nfor Teff , we decreased the metallicity until the molecular features reached a depth of \u223c5%\nrelative to the continuum. We considered this value of Teff and [Fe/H] to be our detection\nlimit. In Figure 5, we plot our stars in temperature\u2013metallicity space imposing our limits of\ndetection for MgH and TiO. At a fixed metallicity, MgH is detectable to considerably higher\nvalues of Teff than TiO. Despite TiO (6.9 eV) having a higher dissociation energy than MgH\n(1.34 eV), the overwhelming H abundance ensures the continuing presence of MgH to higher\ntemperatures.\nAll 14 stars that show neither MgH nor TiO lines occupy a region in temperaturemetallicity space where, for the given stellar parameters, we would not expect to see molecular lines. All 77 stars that show MgH lines lie in the region where, for the given stellar\nparameters, we do expect to see molecular lines. Our approximate limits of detection assume a resolving power of 60,000 and log g = 4.5. For objects observed at a lower resolving\npower, we expect the detection limit would move to lower values of Teff at a fixed metallicity.\nLikewise, the detection limit for giants would be shifted to lower values of Teff at a fixed\nmetallicity. The vast majority of the stars observed in Paper I also lie in the expected regions. That is, stars with MgH lines lie to the left of the detection limit while stars without\nMgH lines fall to the right of the detection limit in Figure 5. We note that the handful\nof stars that do not conform to the predictions are observed at lower resolving powers or\nare giants. Through the synthesis of representative molecular lines, we have performed a\nself-consistency check validating our derived stellar parameters.\n\n5.\n5.1.\n\nDiscussion\nKinematics\n\nWe used the reduced proper-motion constraint to select stars kinematically distinct from\nthe thin disk. This selection criterion was used in order to observe stars on halo-like orbits\nwith halo-like metallicities. The first check we can implement is to determine whether we\nsuccessfully targeted stars with kinematics unlike thin disk stars. Following the Johnson &\nSoderblom (1987) recipe, we calculated the Galactic space-velocity components U (positive\ntowards the Galactic center), V (positive in the direction of Galactic rotation), and W\n(positive towards the north Galactic pole) along with the associated uncertainties \u03c3U , \u03c3V ,\nand \u03c3W (see Table 1). For the solar motion with respect to the local standard of rest (LSR),\nwe assumed the Dehnen & Binney (1998) values (+10,+5,+7) km s\u22121 in (U,V,W). Note that\nin Paper I, we incorrectly applied a correction of \u221210 km s\u22121 in U. Therefore, +20 km s\u22121\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\nmust be added to our values of U in Paper I to obtain ULSR . In the absence of Hipparcos\nparallaxes, spectroscopic parallaxes were determined by using the derived model parameters\nand the Y2 isochrones (Yi et al. 2001). In Figure 6 we plot ULSR , VLSR , and WLSR versus\n[Fe/H] including the stars from Paper I. As in Paper I, we identify stars that lag the LSR,\nV < \u221250 km s\u22121, as likely members of the thick disk or halo. As expected, our reduced\nproper-motion constraint enabled us to select stars belonging to populations kinematically\ndistinct from the thin disk.\n\n5.2.\n\nMetallicity\n\nOur goal was to find stars with [Fe/H]\u2264 \u22121.5. The second check we can conduct is to\nverify the success of our selection criteria in targeting metal-poor stars. In Figure 7 we plot\nthe number of stars versus metallicity for this study, Paper I, Carney et al. (1994), and the\nRyan & Norris (1991) sample. In Paper I, we noted that our distribution was similar to the\nCarney sample. We also mentioned that the Ryan sample had a peak at lower metallicity\nsince these stars were observations of metal-poor candidates identified by Ryan (1989) as\nhaving an ultraviolet excess corresponding to [Fe/H]< \u22121.2, that is, \u03b4(U \u2212 B)0.6 > 0.2. In\nthis study, we were far more successful in identifying metal-poor stars with 38 out of 91 stars\nbeing more metal-poor than [Fe/H]= \u22121.5. As a comparison, in Paper I we had 27 of 134\nstars with [Fe/H]\u2264 \u22121.5. In this study, 32 stars were more metal-poor than [Fe/H]= \u22121.5\nwith MgH lines present in their spectra. As a comparison, 11 stars in Paper I were more\nmetal-poor than [Fe/H]= \u22121.5 with MgH lines present in their spectra. Clearly the selection\ntechnique utilized in this paper was more successful than the technique applied in Paper I.\nThat is, the Salim & Gould (2002) optical-infrared reduced proper-motion diagram separates\nsubdwarfs from main-sequence stars more effectively than a reduced proper-motion diagram\nbased on the original Luyten photometry.\nLet us consider only those stars with 2MASS and USNO photometry, i.e., only the stars\nin Figure 8. After combining this study with the stars in Paper I, we find that 56% (43 of\n76) of stars that lie below the cutoff have [Fe/H]\u2264 \u22121.5. While this is far from the ultra\nmetal-poor stars currently being discovered by other programs, [Fe/H]\u2264 \u22121.5 is a metallicity\nregime in which the Mg isotope ratios have not been explored. In this metallicity range, only\ncool subdwarfs will show MgH lines. We also note that beyond J + 5 log \u03bc = 10, all of the\nobserved stars are more metal-poor than [Fe/H]= \u22121.5.\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\n5.3.\n\nTemperature\n\nOur goal was to find stars with Teff <4700K. More specifically, ideal targets were stars\nwith [Fe/H]< \u22121.5 with MgH molecular lines. Of the 91 stars presented in this paper,\n38 had Teff \u22644700K and given the uncertainties in our derived effective temperatures, we\nnote that 48 of the 91 stars had Teff \u22644800K. As a comparison, in Paper I 44 of the 134\nstars had Teff <4700K and 69 of the 134 stars had Teff \u22644800K. In Figure 9, we plot the\nnumber of stars versus Teff for this study, Paper I, and the Carney et al. (1994) sample. Our\ntemperature distributions are similar between this study and Paper I. Both of our searches\nhave focused upon stars considerably cooler than the Carney study which highlights the\ndifferent temperature regimes of interest. Importantly, 77 of the 91 stars presented here\nhave MgH lines. In Paper I, 100 of the 134 stars had MgH lines.\nIn Paper I, we confirmed Ryan's findings that the Luyten colors were inaccurate. Firstly,\nthe magnitudes were published to only 0.1 mag. Secondly, we chose stars assigned by Luyten\nto color classes g-k, k, or k-m. These stars spanned 4200K < Teff < 6400K yet the Luyten\ncolors for this range of stars were mpg \u2212 mR =0.9, 1.1, or 1.3. We now comment on the\ncolors in the Salim & Gould (2002) study. In Figure 10, we plot the V \u2212 J color against\nour derived temperatures (this study and Paper I) separated into four metallicity bins. This\nFigure shows that a fair estimate of the effective temperature can be obtained from the\nV \u2212 J color. Alonso et al. (1996, 1999) derived Teff :[Fe/H]:color relations for dwarfs and\ngiants using the infrared flux method. They have shown that the V \u2212 K color index provides\nthe most accurate temperature estimates. (We refrain from using the infrared flux method\ncalibrations due to the uncertainties in V .) In Figure 11, we plot the V \u2212K color against our\nderived temperatures and find that the dispersion about the mean is slightly less than for\nV \u2212 J. The K magnitudes were also from 2MASS and presented by Salim & Gould (2002).\nThis reduced scatter in the V \u2212 K versus Teff plot suggests that a reduced proper-motion\ndiagram featuring V \u2212K versus K +5 log \u03bc may be a power tool when the metal-poor targets\nneed to span a small temperature range. In this Figure we also plot the Alonso et al. (1996)\n(V \u2212 K):Teff relation for dwarfs. We find that this relation reasonably matches our data\nthough at the metal-poor end, our data extend to cooler temperatures than the Alonso et al.\n(1996) relations. In both the V \u2212 J and V \u2212 K plots (Figures 10 and 11), we suspect that\nthe dispersion is primarily due to errors in V. Earlier we mentioned that the errors in V\nwere around 0.25 mag while the errors in J (and presumably K) were only 0.02 mag (Salim\n& Gould 2003). While reddening may also be a factor, we note that these cool dwarfs lie\nwithin 100pc of the sun and errors in V \u2212 J and V \u2212 K would overwhelm any reddening\neffects.\nBased on spectrum synthesis, Cottrell (1978) showed that MgH lines in cool stars can\n\n\f\u2013 10 \u2013\nbe a useful metal abundance discriminant. In cool stars, the strength of the MgH lines\ndoes not strongly depend on metallicity, unlike atomic lines. For sufficiently cool stars, a\ndecrease in the metal abundance will weaken the atomic lines whilst the MgH lines remain\nstrong. In Figure 12, we show the spectra of 4 stars highlighting some MgH lines and a\nstrong atomic line. In 2 of the spectra the \"normal\" situation is shown in which the MgH\nlines are dwarfed by the strong atomic line. In the other 2 spectra, Cottrell's prediction\nis verified since the MgH lines are comparable in strength to the atomic line. That is, the\natomic line has weakened while the MgH lines have maintained their strength. Note that all\nstars shown in Figure 12 are very cool. If these stars were solar metallicity, Figure 5 shows\nthat the spectra of these stars would be swamped with TiO lines.\n\n6.\n\nConcluding remarks\n\nWe present stellar parameters for 91 candidate subdwarfs selected primarily by their\nlarge reduced proper-motions. Our goal was to identify metal-poor stars [Fe/H]< \u22121.5 with\nMgH lines. This is the 2nd search that we have conducted for these cool subdwarfs. In our\nfirst search, we drew candidates from a reduced proper-motion diagram based on Luyten's\noriginal photometry. While we were able to find cool subdwarfs, our efficiency was low (11\nof 134 stars had [Fe/H]< \u22121.5 and MgH lines). Errors in the Luyten photometry resulted in\na reduced proper-motion diagram without cleanly separated populations of subdwarfs and\nsolar-metallicity main-sequence stars. In this search, we made use of the 2MASS infrared and\nUSNO optical photometry presented by Salim & Gould (2002). The reduced proper-motion\ndiagram based on this photometry showed distinct populations of subdwarfs and mainsequence stars. Spectroscopic observations of these candidate subdwarfs showed that the\nmajority were metal-poor stars. Of the candidate subdwarfs selected from their location in\nthe optical-infrared reduced proper-motion diagram, we have shown that 56% have [Fe/H]<\n\u22121.5. In Paper I, only 20% of candidates had [Fe/H]< \u22121.5. Further, we verified that the\nV \u2212 J color index was well correlated with Teff such that cool stars suspected of having MgH\nlines could be targeted. We intend to make further observations to identify cool subdwarfs.\nIn this search, we found a further 32 stars with [Fe/H]< \u22121.5 and MgH lines. We intend to\nre-observe candidates from this study with higher resolving power and higher signal-to-noise\nratio in order to measure the Mg isotope ratios to study Galactic chemical evolution.\nWe are grateful to Samir Salim and Andy Gould for providing a list of candidate subdwarfs prior to publication.

We overplot (large circles) the locations of stars we previously observed\nfor which we were able to derive metallicities either in this study or in Paper I. In the upper\nleft panel the large circles are stars with [Fe/H]< \u22121.5, in the upper right panel are stars\nwith \u22121.5 <[Fe/H]< \u22121.0, in the lower left panel are stars with \u22121.0 <[Fe/H]< \u22120.5, and\nin the lower right panel are stars with [Fe/H]> \u22120.5. The dotted and dashed lines (based\non Samir & Gould) define approximate boundaries between main sequence stars (MS), subdwarfs (SD), and white dwarfs (WD). In the upper left panel, the stars with [Fe/H]< \u22122.0\n(open circles) overlap with the [Fe/H]< \u22121.5 stars.\n\n\f\u2013 22 \u2013\n\nFig. 9.- Number of stars versus effective temperature for Paper I (top panel), this study\n(2nd panel), Paper I and this study (3rd panel), and the Carney et al. (1994) study (bottom\npanel). The filled histograms represent the distribution of stars with [Fe/H]\u2264 \u22121.5. Clearly\nour samples peak at lower values of Teff than the Carney sample. The 2nd panel shows that\nour selection technique is very efficient at identifying cool stars with [Fe/H]\u2264 \u22121.5.\n\n\f\u2013 23 \u2013\n\nFig. 10.- V \u2212 J color from Salim & Gould (2002) versus effective temperature derived\nfrom this study and Paper I. In the upper left panel are stars with [Fe/H]< \u22121.5, in the\nupper right panel are stars with \u22121.5 <[Fe/H]< \u22121.0, in the lower left panel are stars with\n\u22121.0 <[Fe/H]< \u22120.5, and in the lower right panel are stars with [Fe/H]> \u22120.5. Given a\nvalue of V \u2212 J, the corresponding Teff can be determined with reasonable accuracy.\n\n\f\u2013 24 \u2013\n\nFig. 11.- V \u2212 K color from Salim & Gould (2002) versus effective temperature derived\nfrom this study and Paper I. In the upper left panel are stars with [Fe/H]< \u22121.5, in the\nupper right panel are stars with \u22121.5 <[Fe/H]< \u22121.0, in the lower left panel are stars with\n\u22121.0 <[Fe/H]< \u22120.5, and in the lower right panel are stars with [Fe/H]> \u22120.5. In each\npanel, the solid line is the (V \u2212 K):Teff relation from Alonso et al. (1996) for dwarfs. The\ndotted line is the extrapolation of the (V \u2212 K):Teff relation.\n\n\f\u2013 25 \u2013\n\nFig. 12.- Observed spectra of 4 different cool subdwarfs. The effective temperature and\nmetallicity of each star is shown. In each panel, the 3 arrows highlight representative MgH\nlines while the asterisk highlights an atomic line (Fe and Ni). In the upper panels, the 3\nMgH lines are dwarfed by the strong atomic line. In the lower panels, the 3 MgH lines are\nof comparable strength to the atomic line.\n\n\f\u2013 26 \u2013\n\nTable 1.
