An analytical transformation method is described which utilizes\ntemperature-dependent zero-field cooling (ZFC) magnetization data to provide a quantitative\nmeasurement of the average diameter and relative abundance of superparamagnetic\nnanoparticles. Applying this method to self-assembled MnAs nanoparticles in MnAs-GaAs\ncomposite films reveals a log-normal size distribution and reduced anisotropy for nanoparticles\ncompared to bulk materials. This analytical technique holds promise for rapid assessment of\nthe size distribution of an ensemble of superparamagnetic nanoparticles.\nMagnetic materials are indispensable components in many electronic device applications and\nare under active investigation to add new functionality for spin electronic devices.1 One of the\nkey issues for progress in this area is a better understanding of the characteristics of\nferromagnets when their size is reduced to nanometer dimensions. While the magnetic\nproperties of an ensemble of nanoparticles can be obtained from magnetization\nmeasurements, determination of the particle dimensions and size distribution usually requires\ncareful analysis of electron microscopy images. In view of this limitation, it is attractive to\nexplore new methods to determine nanoparticle dimensions directly from measured magnetic\nproperties. It is known that the average particle size in an ensemble of magnetic nanoparticles\ncan be estimated from magnetic measurements by several methods, such as fitting the fielddependent magnetic moment, m(H), to a classical Langevin function.2 In some systems, the\naverage particle size of superparamagnetic3 nanoparticles can be obtained from the thermal\nblocking temperature, TB, determined from magnetic measurements, which is defined as the\ntemperature that marks the transition from slow magnetic moment relaxation to rapid\nrelaxation within a proscribed measurement time window.4,5 While these techniques identify\nthe average diameter of an ensemble of magnetic nanoparticles, they do not provide\ninformation on the distribution of the sizes of particles.\nIn this letter we demonstrate a novel method for obtaining the average diameter as well as the\ndistribution of diameters of an ensemble of superparamagnetic nanoparticles using\nthermomagnetic measurements. This transformation method makes use of an approximation\nto convert the measured temperature-dependent zero-field-cooling (ZFC) magnetic moment,\nmZFC(T), into a probability distribution of the particle size. The method was successfully tested\n\n\f2\non composite structures containing MnAs nanoparticles in a GaAs matrix. Additionally, a\ncomparison of the thermomagnetically-derived size distribution and that obtained from\nelectron microscopy of nanoparticles allowed determination of the uniaxial magnetic\nanisotropy constant for MnAs. Moreover, it was found that the distribution in particle size\nconforms to a log-normal distribution function, and that the anisotropy constant is substantially\nsmaller for nanoparticles than for the bulk system.\nThe method for extracting the size distribution of an ensemble of superparamagnetic\nnanoparticle from mZFC(T) data is based on the N\u0117el model,3 which describes the relaxation of\nnoninteracting, single-domain magnetic nanoparticles that experience uniaxial anisotropy.\nUniaxial anisotropy provides a double-well potential for the two directions of magnetic moment\nalignment. The wells are separated by an energy barrier EB that may be overcome by thermal\nactivation with a relaxation time of \u03c4 = \u03c4oexp(EB/kBT), where 1/\u03c4o is the attempt frequency. In\nthe small-field limit EB = KeffV, where Keff is the effective anisotropy constant and V is the particle\nvolume. Since the typical measurement time for a SQUID magnetometer is \u03c4 ~ 102 s and the\nattempt time is \u03c4o ~ 10-9s, the ratio of anisotropy energy to thermal energy is commonly given\nby\nKeffV/kBTB=25.\n(1)\nNote that changing either \u03c4 or \u03c4o by one order of magnitude produces a small change (~10%) in\nthe constant, which rescales TB or V by that amount, and thus rescales the diameter by only 3%.\nWithin the assumptions of the model, for a measured TB this equation allows determination of\nthe magnetic volume of particles when the value of Keff is known. Conversely, Keff may be\ndetermined if the average particle volume is known. Finally, there are several limitations to this\nmethod that must be considered for application: the magnetic field applied for ZFC\nmeasurements must be small compared to the anisotropy field so that it does not lower the\neffective barrier height;6 it neglects particle-particle dipolar interactions, which increase the\napparent blocking temperature;7 and complications arise from multiaxial (cubic) anisotropy,3\nwhich reduce the effective barrier height.\nThe functional distribution of the particle volume f(V) or of the particle diameter f(D) can be\ncomputed from the mZFC(T) data. Since each nanoparticle of volume V is characterized by a\nunique blocking temperature TB through Eq. (1), the size distribution may be obtained by\nmapping the distribution in blocking temperature f(TB) onto f(V). The moment mZFC(T) of an\nensemble of magnetic nanoparticles is given by8\nmZFC (T ) \uf03d\n\nH mS2 (T ) T\nf (TB ) dTB ,\n3 k BT \uf0f20\n\n(2)\n\nwhere mS is the saturation moment of the ensemble and its temperature dependence can be\nneglected for materials with Curie temperature TC>>TB. The relative distribution function is\ngiven by the approximation\nf (TB ) \uf0b5\n\n1 d\n\uf05bT mZFC (T )\uf05d ,\nTB2 dT\n\n(3)\n\n\f3\nor simply\n\nf (D) \uf03d fo\n\n1 d\n\uf05bT mZFC (T )\uf05d ,\nTB2 dT\n\n(4)\n\nwhere fo is a scaling function.9,10\nAssuming spherical particles, the distribution in particle diameter f(D) = f(TB)[dTB/dD] is\ncomputed using Eq. (1) with V = \u03c0D3/6. The accuracy of the approximation in Eq. (3) was\nevaluated by assuming log-normal distributions,\nf(D) \uf03b (1/D\u03c3) exp{-[ln(D)-\u03bc]2/2\u03c32},\n\n(5)\n\nusing a range of standard deviations \u03c3 (relative distribution width). These f(D) were then used\nto compute mZFC(T) via Eq. (2), followed by recomputing f(D) again via Eq. (3). It was found that\nthe log-normal f(D) was accurately reproduced in this test. However, the mean particle\ndiameter <D> = exp(\uf06d+\u03c32/2) and the distribution width were slightly overestimated, increasing\nfor increasing standard deviation \u03c3. For narrow distributions, \u03c3 \u2264 0.3, the overestimation in the\nmean diameter and distribution width was limited to \u2264 10%, while for broader distributions, \u03c3 =\n0.4, the overestimations were ~20%.\n\nTo test the thermomagnetic analysis model,\ncomposite\nfilms\ncontaining\nMnAs\nnanoparticles were fabricated by annealing\nhomogeneous Ga0.9Mn0.1As films grown at\nlow temperatures by solid-source molecular\nbeam epitaxy (MBE) on GaAs substrates.\nMnAs nanoparticles were produced by selfassembly\nafter\nannealing\nat\nhigh\ntemperatures in the MBE chamber. The\nstarting materials in this study were 20 to 50\nnm thick films containing 7-10 at% Mn which\nwere grown at 250 oC. Figure 1 shows the\neffects of annealing films at different\ntemperatures through measurements of the\nlow-field, temperature-dependent magnet\nmoment, m(T). The starting films were first\nannealed in air18 at 250 oC for 30-60 minutes\n\nMagnetic Moment (arbitrary)\n\nThe transformation in Eqs. (3-4) was applied to composite structures containing MnAs\nnanoparticles in a GaAs matrix. This material combines a ferromagnet with a semiconductor\nwhich makes it attractive for investigating aspects of spin physics.11,12,13 MnAs holds potential\nfor devices by virtue of its room temperature ferromagnetism and compatibility with GaAs\ntechnology. Nanocomposites containing MnAs nanoparticles can be easily fabricated through\nself-assembly by annealing homogeneous films of Ga1-xMnxAs.14,15,16 The annealing parameters\ncan be adjusted to produce varying magnetic properties,16,17 ranging from small\nsuperparamagnetic particles to larger size particles that are single-domain ferromagnets.\n1.2\nGaAs:Mn Films\n\n1.0\n0.8\n\n630 \u00b0C anneal\n\n0.6\n0.4\n\n530 \uf0b0C anneal\n\n0.2\n0\n\n250 \uf0b0C anneal\n\n0\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\nT (K)\nFIG. 1.

This film is ferromagnetic below the Curie temperature of TC=90 K. Samples annealed insitu at temperatures 530-580 oC in an arsenic flux produced small superparamagnetic\nnanoparticles, shown by the squares for 530 oC annealing. The field-cooled m(T) trend\ndecreases paramagnetically as 1/T for increasing temperature. Samples annealed at\ntemperatures \u2265630 oC produced larger ferromagnetic MnAs particles with a bulk-like TC in the\nrange ~340 K, shown by the triangle data markers. These magnetic properties were measured\nusing a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetometer (Quantum\nDesign, MPMS XL-5) with the applied field oriented in the plane of the films. The physical size\ndistribution was obtained by manually analyzing scanning electron microscope (SEM) images\n(see inset of Fig. 2). It is noted that the particles are well-separated in accordance with the\nassumptions of the model. The structure of the MnAs nanoparticles was not directly\ndetermined, however, slow annealing as used here can produce either zincblende or NiAs-type\nhexagonal structures,16,17,21 while rapid thermal annealing generally produces hexagonal crystal\nstructures14,16.\nFigure 2 shows the measured mZFC(T) data for\nensembles of magnetic MnAs nanoparticles\nacquired by cooling the sample to low\ntemperatures in zero applied field, after\nwhich a small field (50-100 Oe) was applied\nand the magnetic moment measured for\nincreasing temperature. The mZFC(T) data for\nfilms annealed at 530 and 580 oC shows\nblocking temperature peaks followed by a 1/T\nparamagnetic dependence for increasing\ntemperature.

The inset shows an SEM image of\nfrom the measured mZFC(T) data and Eq. (3). MnAs nanoparticles for the film annealed at 530 oC,\nNext, the thermomagnetic distribution of where the bar represents 50 nm.\ndiameters f(D) was computed from f(TB) and is\nshown by the solid points in Fig. 3. For comparison, the figure also plots histograms of the\nphysical particle size distributions obtained from SEM images. The thermomagnetic\ndistributions were made to overlap the histograms by selecting a value for the effective uniaxial\nanisotropy constant.22 For both films, Keff=4x104 erg/cm3 was used. In Fig 3(a) there is excellent\nagreement between the two distributions, including the slow decrease on the large diameter\nside of the peak that is characteristic of a log-normal distribution. The solid curve is a fit to the\nthermomagnetic data using a log-normal function with a mean nanoparticle diameter of\n<D>=15.9 nm and standard deviation \u03c3=0.34. In contrast, the film annealed at higher\ntemperature, shown in Fig. 3(b), displays a large difference between the thermomagnetic and\nphysical distributions. While the distribution of physical particle size extends to large diameters,\nthe thermomagnetic distribution is confined to a region of small diameters.23 This is expected\n\n\f5\nsince the larger particles exceed the diameter\nfor superparamagnetism and do not\ncontribute to the ZFC thermal blocking\nbehavior. Thus, superparamagnetism is\nlimited to particle diameters less than 30-40\nnm for this system.\nThe anisotropy constant is an important\nmaterials parameter, and its measurement\nlends insight into the role of particle-matrix\ninteractions in magnetic nanoparticles,\nprovided that interparticle interactions are\nminimal. The effective anisotropy constant of\nMnAs has been reported in the literature for\nbulk, thin films, and nanocrystals. At room\ntemperature, bulk MnAs is characterized by a\nvalue24 Keff=76x104 erg/cm3, while thin films\ngrown on GaAs substrates exhibit anisotropy\nvalues25,26,27,28 ranging from 12x104 to 72x104\nerg/cm3. It was also found that for MnAs\nnanocrystals somewhat smaller than those of\nthis study, the anisotropy values29 were in the\nrange 14x104 to 18x104 erg/cm3. The smaller\nanisotropy for embedded MnAs nanocrystals\ncould arise from a modified crystal structure,\nlattice mismatch at the nanoparticle surface,\nmatrix-induced strain, or electric field effects\nat the particle-matrix interface. Additional\nstudies are required to examine this aspect.\n\nFIG. 3. Distribution probability versus particle\ndiameter, f(D), for MnAs nanoparticles in GaAs\nmatrix films. Solid data points represent diameters\nderived from thermomagnetic analysis of the ZFC\nmoment using Eq. (3). The histograms represent the\nphysical diameters obtained from electron\nmicroscope images. The solid curves are fits of a lognormal function to the thermomagnetic data. (a)\nData for the film annealed at 530 oC has a median\nparticle diameter of 15.0 nm and standard deviation\n\u03c3=0.34. (b) Data for the film annealed at 580 oC,\nwhere the dashed curve is a log-normal fit to the\nhistogram. The small (large) round objects represent\nmagnetic nanoparticles with fluctuating (static)\nmoments.\n\nIn conclusion, it is shown that thermomagnetic data obtained from an ensemble of\nsuperparamagnetic nanoparticles can be transformed into a distribution in particle size. The\ntransformation relies on ZFC magnetic data that is readily obtained during characterization of\nthe magnetic properties of the nanoparticles. In addition, the nanocrystal anisotropy can be\ninvestigated by combining the thermomagnetic distribution with the physical size distribution.\nThe application of this method to MnAs nanoparticles indicates that the anisotropy constant\ncan be significantly modified for nanometer size particles.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThis work supported by the National Science Foundation grant DMR-0907007.

As a result, the relative width of the lognormal distribution given by \u03c3 is independent of the value of Keff.\n23\nData for the thermomagnetic distribution does not extend to larger particle sizes due to the limited\nrange of temperatures for mZFC(T).\n24\nR.W.
