Introduction\nCarbon monoxide was first definitely detected spectroscopically\nin the Martian atmosphere by Kaplan et al. (1969). From observations performed in 1967 between Mars L s = 110\u25e6 and 133\u25e6 a\nvolume mixing ratio (vmr) of 800 ppm was deduced Kakar et al.\n(1977) reported the first microwave detection of CO performed\nin 1975, when observing the J = 1\u20130 rotational transition during\nL s = 339\u25e6 . They found a vmr of 1900 ppm assuming a diskaveraged continuum brightness temperature of 200 K and a constant height profile. Good & Schloerb (1981) observed the same\ntransition in 1980 during L s = 86\u25e6 and found 3200 ppm. The reanalysis of these data by Clancy & Muhleman (1983) resulted in\nquite different values: 800\u00b1400 ppm from the Kakar et al. (1977)\nobservation and 1400 \u00b1 500 ppm from the Good & Schloerb\n(1981) observation by assuming a surface brightness temperature of 206 K, a \u00b110 K variation in model atmosphere temperatures, and a surface pressure of 6.5 hPa. They found 2200 \u00b1 1000\nppm, based on their own observations of the CO (2\u20131) line performed in 1982 (L s = 75\u25e6 ) with the same model assumptions.\nClancy et al. (1990) derived a mixing ratio of 600 \u00b1 150 ppm\nfrom 1988/9 observations (L s = 197\u25e6 \u2212 341\u25e6 ) of the 12 CO and\n13\nCO transitions (1\u20130 and 2\u20131) and surface brightness temperatures between 192 and 216 K. They did not find any significant\ntemporal variability of CO. Rosenqvist et al. (1990) found a CO\nvmrs between 800 and 1200 ppm depending on the orography\nfrom Phobos/ISM observations. Lellouch et al. (1991) provided\nfor the first time a mm-wave map of CO (1988, L s = 270\u25e6 ) and\n?\n\nHerschel is an ESA space observatory with science instruments\nprovided by European-led Principal Investigator consortia and with important participation from NASA.\n\ndeduced no significant variation from their derived value of 800\n\u00b1 200 ppm over the Mars disk. While the 230 GHz observations provided reasonable surface brightness temperatures, the\nvalues in the 115 GHz band are too high (270 K), very likely\ndue to sideband ratio calibration errors. Billebaud et al. (1998)\nretrieved values between 450 and 1150 ppm from ground-based\nIR observations in 1990/1. Also from ground-based IR observations, Krasnopolsky (2003) found a hemispheric asymmetry\nwith the CO vmr increasing from 850 ppm at 23\u25e6 N to 1250 ppm\nat 50\u25e6 S (at L s = 112\u25e6 ). Follow-up observations of Krasnopolsky\n(2007) between 80\u25e6 N to 75\u25e6 S over 4 seasons show even larger\nvariations between 700 and 1600 ppm. Encrenaz et al. (2006) report about a seasonal variation in CO over Hellas by a factor of 2\nfrom 2.3 \u03bcm CO band observations by OMEGA/MEX. Infrared\nobservations of PFS/MEX result in similar variabilities over latitude and season, i.e. with a mean value of 1100 ppm (Billebaud\net al. 2009). Finally, Smith et al. (2009) derived seasonally and\nglobally averaged 700 ppm CO vmr from CRISM/MRO observations, but with strong seasonal variations at high latitudes. The\nsummertime near-polar CO mixing ratio was observed to fall to\n200 ppm in the south and 400 ppm in the north during the time\nthe carbon dioxide was sublimating from the seasonal ice caps.\nThe determination of the vertical profile of temperature and\nCO (together with studies of the carbon and oxygen isotopic\nratios in CO) over different solar longitudes of Mars is one of\nthe goals of the Herschel key programme \"Water and related\nchemistry in the solar system\" (Hartogh et al. 2009). Here we\npresent first results of observations performed in April 2010\naround L s = 76\u25e6 . In this paper we derive the CO mixing ratio and temperature profile from HIFI observations. The latter is\nalso required for analysing other species not treated in this paper.\n1\n\n\fP. Hartogh et al.: Herschel/HIFI observations of CO in the Martian atmosphere\n\nFor simplification we analyse two CO lines (the 7\u20136 transitions\nof the isotopes 13 CO and C18 O) observed at the same time and\nin the same sideband.\n\n15.5\n\n1342194686-WBS-H\n15.0\n\nAll observations were carried out in HIFI's dual beam switch\nmode (de Graauw et al. 2010; Roelfsema et al. 2010) on operational days (OD) 332, 333, 334, and 337, corresponding to\n11\u201316 April 2010 or L s = 75.8\u25e6 to 78\u25e6 . Dedicated line observations include CO (5\u20134, 6\u20135, 8\u20137), 13 CO (7\u20136), C17 O (7\u20136), and\nC18 O (7\u20136). HIFI spectrometers can resolve line shapes with a\nspectral resolution of 140 KHz (High Resolution Spectrometer;\nHRS) or 1.1 MHz (Wide Band Spectrometer; WBS). The integration times range from 93 s for the strongest 12 CO lines to\n9289 s for the C17 O observation. Numerous other CO-lines were\ndetected in the band scans or as side products of other dedicated line observations, appearing in the intermediate frequency\neither in the same or other sideband (double sideband conversion), some of them with excellent signal-to-noise ratios. The\nfirst set of data was available about a week after the observations\nand was processed with the standard HIPE v3.0.1 modules (Ott\n2010) up to level 2. This data set was not complete yet; for instance, the data of the HRS was only partly available, and pointing products therein had no entries. The flux calibration by the\nHerschel Science Centre (HSC) was still in progress and some\ncalibration errors occurred in this first data set. Furthermore, it\nturned out in the band scan data that the line amplitudes of the\ndetected CO lines were not always exactly the same in the upper\nand lower sidebands. Last but not least, the HIFI spectra suffered from a relatively large baseline ripple (Fig. 1). Fortunately,\nthe frequency of the ripple generally is the same in the vertical\nand horizontal polarizations; however, phase and amplitudes are\ndifferent so they need a dedicated treatment before both polarizations can be averaged. Solutions of these problems are under way, but only partly available now. Therefore we decided\nto analyse the data with the following boundary conditions: (i)\nline-to-continuum ratio rather than absolute fluxes (requires assumptions on the surface brightness), (ii) only horizontal polarization (hence decreases the signal-to-noise ratio), (iii) only lines\nin the same sideband, (iv) only WBS spectra. The surface pressure averaged over the visible Mars disk changes diurnally in\nthe order of 10% (derived from the European Mars Climate Data\nBase, EMCD v4.1, Forget et al. 1999; Lewis et al. 1999 and our\nown general circulation model, Hartogh et al. 2005; Medvedev\n& Hartogh 2007). Therefore we introduced boundary condition\n(v) to analyse only lines observed at the same time. The only\ndata that fulfil these criteria are the (7\u20136) transitions of 13 CO\nand C18 O, which were observed on 13 April 2010 at 05:33 UT\n(Obs. Id. 1342194686). The integration time for this observation\nwas 900 s.\n\n3. Analysis and discussion\nCompared to cometary observations of HIFI (Hartogh et al.\n2010; de Val-Borro et al. 2010), the baseline ripple on the Mars\nobservations is rather large because of its strong continuum\nemission. This phenomenon was frequently observed by groundbased observations of planets. While in the cometary case, the\nbaseline ripple has been removed with a polynomial fit, for Mars\nwe determined the baseline frequencies by a normalized periodogram according to Lomb (1976) and subtracted 3 periods\nfrom the original spectrum.

C18 O (left) and 13 CO (right) WBS spectra before baseline\nripple removal. Both lines are in the same sideband.\n\nthe determination of the baseline periods is negligible when taking the large number of periods in the spectrum into account. The\nobserved spectral lines have been modelled using a standard radiative transfer code: Mars was assumed as a perfect sphere surrounded by a set of hundred concentric atmospheric layers of 1\nkm thickness each (as in Rengel et al. 2008). Within each layer\nthe atmospheric temperature, pressure, and volume-mixing ratio\nof carbon monoxide have been assumed constant. The surface\ncontinuum emission was modelled as blackbody emission using\na temperature distribution falling off towards the edge of the apparent disk according to T (\u03b1) = T 0 \u00d7 (1 \u2212 0.2 \u00d7 (1 \u2212 cos(\u03b1))),\nwith \u03b1 running from 0\u25e6 (nadir) to 90\u25e6 (limb) across the apparent\ndisk (limb darkening, compare also Cavali\u00e9 et al. 2008).\nThe emission was obtained by integrating over the apparent\ndisk using 64 concentric rings distributed unevenly over the disk\nand the limb region. The variation in the path lengths through\nthe atmosphere were taken into account fully when calculating\nthe radiation transfer for each ring. In our model the total continuum flux emitted by the surface depends purely on the choice of\nthe temperature T 0 , which defines the temperature scale for the\ntemperature profile to be retrieved. We have adjusted T 0 in such\na way as to exactly match the total flux predicted by the 'Mars\ncontinuum model' of \u223c 4230 Jy provided by Lellouch & Amri\n(2008) and to match the temperature fall off towards the limb\ntherein by a factor 0.2. The error of the modelled flux is 5%.\nAbsorption coefficients for the CO spectral lines were calculated using the HITRAN 2008 spectral line catalogue, keeping\nthe terrestrial isotopic ratios in it; i.e., C16 O/C18 O = 498.70 and\n12\nCO/13 CO = 89.01. Krasnopolsky et al. (2007) conclude that\nthe deviations of these isotopic ratios on Mars compared to Earth\nare less than 2%. However, to account for carbon dioxide instead\nof air as broadening gas, the broadening parameters provided by\nthe catalogue were multiplied by a factor of 1.4 according to\nNakazawa & Tanaka (1982).\nTo obtain a temperature profile and the mixing ratio of CO\nwe employed Rodger's optimal estimation method (Rodgers\n\n\fP.

The 13 CO and C18 O lines after removal of the baseline ripples. A radiative transfer model was fitted simultaneously to the\nspectra to retrieve temperature profile and volume mixing ratio of CO. The lower panels show the differences between model and\nobservations.\n1976, 1990). This method uses so-called 'a priori' information \u2013\nin our case the best estimate of the temperature profile and CO\nmixing ratio profile \u2013 which is then updated to allow for a best\nfit of the spectral line shapes (minimization of \u03c72 ). This a priori\nprofile was taken from our MAOAM general circulation model\n(Hartogh et al. 2005) considering the exact observation date, geometry, and time of the HIFI observations. The surface pressure\naveraged over the visible disk was 6.7 hPa. Compared to temperature profiles derived from the EMCD, we find temperature differences less than 3 K between 3\u201360 km. EMCD provides about\n5 K higher temperatures below 3 km and 3 to 5 K higher temperatures between 60\u201380 km. Up to 100 km, both models slowly\nmerge to almost the same temperature. It is worth noting a high\ndegree of coincidence of the averaged temperature profiles over\nthe field of view of the telescope with the two models. Even\nthough the one from EMCD represents monthly averaged fields,\nthe one from MAOAM is based on an instantaneous snapshot,\nand generally the altitude-latitude distributions differ. This increases our degree of confidence in the simulated temperatures.\nA simultaneous fit of the two spectral lines allows retrieving temperature and mixing ratios independently, because of the\nrather different optical depth of the two lines, where the 13 CO\nline is optically thick (\u03c4 = 6.3 in line centre) and the C18 O line\nbeing optically thin (\u03c4 = 1.1). Figure 2 shows the simultane-\n\nously fitted spectra of 13 CO and C18 O (and the residuals) after\nthe removal of the baseline ripple. The retrieved CO mixing ratio\namounts to 980\u00b1100 ppm which is in agreement with the one detected by SPIRE observations during L s = 5\u25e6 from 6 November\n2009 at 20:20 UT (Swinyard et al. 2010) under rather similar\nsurface pressure conditions. The SPIRE value of 900 ppm has\nbeen used as an a priori input to the retrieval algorithm. Figure 3\nshows the corresponding temperature profile and the averaging\nkernels. The latter provide information about the sensitivity of\nthe retrieval versus altitude. Although the contribution of the a\npriori profile to the retrieved temperature profile is less than 10%\nbelow 60 km, it fits quite well to the profiles predicted by the\nGCMs. However, the differences are least with EMCD near the\nground (\u223c 5 K) and with MAOAM near 60\u201370 km. Nevertheless,\nthe observations provide about 12\u201315 K lower temperatures near\n65 km. The temperature inversion between 40\u201360 km predicted\nby the GCMs should be manifested in an emission feature in\nthe centre of the CO lines, which obviously is not the case. The\n5% error of the model continuum flux translates into a roughly\n5% shift of the temperature profiles, i.e., all temperatures will be\nabout 10 K higher or lower than the retrieved value. In the first\ncase, the agreement with the model profile is better between 40\u2013\n80 km (although still without temperature inversion) but worse\n\n3\n\n\faltitude (km)\n\nP.

The averaging kernels express the response\nof the fitted temperature profile to a delta function perturbation in the true profile at a certain altitude (see Rodgers 1990, for a\nsound introduction of this quantity). Different colours are used to distinguish the averaging kernels belonging to perturbations at the\ndifferent altitude levels. The blue temperature profile is derived from EMCD.\nbelow 40 km. In the second case the agreement is worse for all\naltitudes.\n\n4. Summary\nThis work presents the first simultaneous retrievals of temperature and carbon monoxide in the Martian atmosphere derived\nfrom HIFI data. The temperature profile can be used as an input parameter for determining of concentrations of other gases\nobserved by HIFI during the same period. Future work will include all observed CO transitions in order to better constrain the\ntemperature profile above 60 km and take advantage of the much\nwider opacity range for retrieving the vertical profile of CO.\nAcknowledgements.
