Moreover, we prove that if the spacetime admits a\ncomplete timelike Killing field, then the light cones can be widened preserving\nboth global hyperbolicity and the Killing property of the field.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nThis work is devoted to the proof of the stability of the globally hyperbolic\nproperty of spacetimes, where the word stability refers to a particular topology\non the space of spacetime metrics. We stress that we are not going to consider\nthe problem of stability of a property under evolution, indeed in this work we\ndo not impose any evolution equation, such as Einstein's equations, on the\nspacetime. All the results of this work will concern instead the stability of a\nproperty of spacetime where the latter is regarded as a whole.\nOf course the interest of physicists for global hyperbolicity comes from the\nfact that this property assures the predictability of the spacetime evolution from\ninitial data on a spacelike hypersurface. It is a property which allows one to\nregard the spacetime geometrodynamics as deterministic, in analogy with other\nfield theories. Its stability, in any considered form, is therefore particularly\nwelcomed as it shows that it could be realized in nature. As mentioned, we\nshall consider only the problem of stability with respect to spacetime metric\nperturbations rather than Cauchy data perturbations.\nIn a sense this last problem, at least for global hyperbolicity, makes less sense\nbecause, according to the Choquet-Bruhat\u2013Geroch theorem, for every vacuum\ninitial data (given by a Riemannian space and an extrinsic curvature tensor\nfield (S, h, K)), there exists a unique, up to isometric diffeomorphism, vacuum\ndevelopment (M, g), which is globally hyperbolic and inextendible in the class\n\u2217 This archive version includes a detailed discussion of Geroch's original argument (see Sect.\n3), which has been omitted in the published version: J.

Thus, perturbing the initial\nconditions would still lead, after evolution, to a globally hyperbolic spacetime\nwhich is still inextendible in the class of globally hyperbolic spacetimes. In\nthis evolutionary sense global hyperbolicity is trivially stable. Of course, if one\npairs global hyperbolicity with the inextendibility property (not restricting to\nthe globally hyperbolic class) one obtains a stability problem which is known as\nStrong Cosmic Censorship Problem [19, 20, 16].\nComing to our framework, the topology on (conformal classes of) spacetime\nmetrics to which we shall refer to is Geroch's interval topology [5]. In this\ntopology an open set is obtained by giving, continuously and for each spacetime\npoint, two light cones one inside the other and by considering all the metrics\nwhose light cones respect those bounds (see next section). If a metric stays\nin the open set then perturbing its coefficients in a coordinate chart would\nkeep the metric inside the open set, provided the perturbation is sufficiently\nsmall, because the light cone on the tangent space depends continuously on the\nmetric coefficients (indeed the C 0 topology on metrics passes to the quotient of\nconformal classes to Geroch's interval topology [11]).\nActually, Geroch's interval topology is one of the coarsest topologies that\ncan be given on the space of (conformal classes of) metrics [11] and hence\nthe stability in this topology is particularly strong. There is only one other\nimportant topology that has been used in the literature and which is coarser\nthan Geroch's interval topology: the compact-open topology [8, Sect. 6.4,7.6]\n[7]. In this topology a base open set of the topology is obtained as above but\nthe metric light cones are bounded only inside a compact set of spacetime.\nNevertheless, it is obvious that a property such as global hyperbolicity cannot\nbe stable in this topology indeed, already for Minkowski 3 + 1 spacetime, no\nmatter how large a compact set C is, and how much we constraint the metric\ninside the compact set, it is possible to open the cones sufficiently far from C\nso as to produce closed causal curves and hence spoil global hyperbolicity.\nAn argument of proof was produced by Geroch [5], but, as we shall explain in\ndetail in Sect. 3, that argument does not really work without introducing some\nnon trivial amendments. Perhaps for this reason, this result is not included in\nany textbook devoted to mathematical relativity.\nIn the next section we give a direct and strictly topological proof of the\nstability of global hyperbolicity which, contrary to Geroch's argument [5], does\nnot use the concept of Cauchy hypersurface or the topological splitting. As\na corollary of this result we obtain that every globally hyperbolic spacetime\nadmits a Cauchy hypersurface that remains Cauchy for small perturbations of\nthe spacetime metric (remark 2.9).\nWe also prove that if the spacetime admits a complete timelike Killing field,\nthen it is possible to enlarge the light cones while keeping global hyperbolicity\nand stationarity in such a way that the timelike Killing field is left unchanged.\nWe refer the reader to [15] for most of the conventions used in this work.\nIn particular, we denote with (M, g) a C r spacetime (connected, Hausdorff,\ntime-oriented Lorentzian and hence paracompact manifold), r \u2208 3, . . . , \u221e of\narbitrary dimension n \u2265 2 and signature (\u2212, +, . . . , +). On M \u00d7 M the usual\n2\n\n\fproduct topology is defined. The subset symbol \u2282 is reflexive, thus X \u2282 X.\nWe use the dot to denote the boundary of a set, e.g. \u1e8a. With Jg+ we specify\nthe causal relation referring to metric g. With x < y we mean that there is a\nfuture directed causal curve joining x and y and we write x \u2264 y (also denoted\n(x, y) \u2208 J + ) if x < y or x = y. Given two metrics g, g \u2032 we write g < g \u2032 if, for\nevery p \u2208 M , the causal cone of g in T Mp is contained in the timelike cone of g \u2032 ,\nand we write g \u2264 g \u2032 if for every p \u2208 M , the causal cone of g in T Mp is contained\nin the causal cone of g \u2032 .\n\n2\n\nThe proof\n\nLet us recall that a spacetime is non-total imprisoning if no inextendible causal\ncurve is entirely contained in a compact set. A globally hyperbolic spacetime\n(M, g) is a causal spacetime such that for every p, q \u2208 M , J + (p) \u2229 J \u2212 (q) is\ncompact [4, 15]. A spacetime is globally hyperbolic if and only if it admits a\nCauchy hypersurface, namely a (closed) acausal set intersected by any inextendible causal curve [8, 18]. A useful alternative definition is [13]: a spacetime\nis globally hyperbolic if it is non-total imprisoning and for every p, q \u2208 M ,\nJ + (p) \u2229 J \u2212 (q) has compact closure.\nA stably causal spacetime (M, g) is a spacetime for which there is a metric\ng \u2032 > g such that (M, g \u2032 ) is causal. Global hyperbolicity implies stable causality\nwhich implies non-total imprisonment [8, 15]. The intervals (g, g) = {g : g <\ng < g} form a base for Geroch's interval topology on the space of conformal\nclasses Con(M ) (i.e. equivalence classes of metrics which are identical up to\na positive conformal factor). This topology is equivalent to that induced from\nWhitney's fine C 0 topology on the space of metrics Lor(M ) (see [11]).\nIn general, a conformally invariant property P of (M, g) is said to be stable\nin the interval topology if there is an interval (g, g) \u220b g of metrics that share it.\nSince no mention is made of the differentiability of the metrics contained the\nintervals this topology is quite coarse and the stability with respect to it is a\nstrong for of stability.\nSome properties are inherited by spacetimes obtained by narrowing the light\ncones, that is: if (M, g) satisfies P and g \u2032\u2032 < g then (M, g \u2032\u2032 ) satisfies P (see [12,\nSect. 2]). One such such property is global hyperbolicity as it is evident from\nthe second definition given above. In this case in order to prove the stability\nof the property we need only to show that there is g \u2032 > g which satisfies the\nproperty. In particular, we shall look for a continuous g \u2032 . Of course, given a\ncontinuous g \u2032 > g which does the job it is not difficult to find another metric\nin the interval (g, g \u2032 ) with the same degree of differentiability of g. Ultimately,\nthis is the reason why, in all the considerations of stability, the differentiability\nof the metrics will play no significative role.\nThe next result is well known, we include the proof for the sake of completeness.\nLemma 2.1. Let (M, g) be a causal spacetime, then it is globally hyperbolic if\nand only if for every compact set K, J + (K) \u2229 J \u2212 (K) is compact.\n3\n\n\fProof. One direction is trivial. For the other direction we have to prove that\nJ + (K)\u2229J \u2212 (K) is compact. Let us consider an arbitrary sequence pn \u2208 J + (K)\u2229\nJ \u2212 (K), then there are two sequences rn , qn \u2208 K such that rn \u2264 pn \u2264 qn . As a\nfirst step let us show that pn is contained in a compact set, which implies that\nJ + (K) \u2229 J \u2212 (K) has compact closure. If not we could pass to a subsequence\ndenoted in the same way such that pn \u2192 +\u221e (i.e. escapes every compact\nset) while rn \u2192 r, qn \u2192 q for some r, q \u2208 K. But then, taking r\u2032 \u226a r and\nq \u2032 \u226b q, we have since I + is open and I + \u2282 J + , pn \u2208 J + (r\u2032 ) \u2229 J \u2212 (q \u2032 ) which is\ncompact, a contradiction. We have therefore shown that there is p \u2208 M such\nthat pn \u2192 p and it remains to prove that p \u2208 J + (K) \u2229 J \u2212 (K). Again passing to\na subsequence if necessary we can assume rn \u2192 r and qn \u2192 q for some r, q \u2208 K.\nSince J + is closed (because global hyperbolicity implies causal simplicity) we\nconclude r \u2264 p \u2264 q and hence the thesis.\nThe next lemma is [12, Lemma 3.2].\nLemma 2.2. If g < g \u2032 then Jg+ \u2282 Jg+\u2032 .\nLemma 2.3. In a globally hyperbolic spacetime (M, g), if C is a compact set and\nT\nT\ng\u0303 > g then J + (C) = g<g\u2032 <g\u0303 Jg+\u2032 (C) (and analogously J \u2212 (C) = g<g\u2032 <g\u0303 Jg\u2212\u2032 (C)).\nT\nT\nProof. Let us prove as a first step that g<g\u2032 <g\u0303 Jg+\u2032 (C) = g<g\u2032 <g\u0303 Jg+\u2032 (C). The\ninclusion \u2282 is obvious. For the other inclusion let us prove that for every\nT\n\u011d, g < \u011d < g\u0303, g<g\u2032 <g\u0303 Jg+\u2032 (C) \u2282 J\u011d+ (C), the first step will follow from the\nT\narbitrariness of \u011d. Indeed, let q \u2208 g<g\u2032 <g\u0303 Jg+\u2032 (C) and take \u01e7, g < \u01e7 < g\u0303, such\n\nthat \u01e7 < \u011d. Since q \u2208 J\u01e7+ (C) there is a sequence qn \u2208 J\u01e7+ (C) such that qn \u2192 q.\nThus there are pn \u2208 C such that (pn , qn ) \u2208 J\u01e7+ , and since C is compact we\ncan assume without loss of generality that pn \u2192 p \u2208 C. We conclude that\n(p, q) \u2208 J\u01e7+ . By lemma 2.2 we have J\u01e7+ \u2282 J\u011d+ and hence q \u2208 J\u011d+ (p) \u2282 J\u011d+ (C),\nT\nor, due to the arbitrariness of q, g<g\u2032 <g\u0303 Jg+\u2032 (C) \u2282 J\u011d+ (C), which completes the\nfirst step.\nT\nIt remains to prove J + (C) = g<g\u2032 <g\u0303 Jg+\u2032 (C). The inclusion \u2282 is trivial.\nT\nFor the other inclusion let q \u2208 g<g\u2032 <g\u0303 Jg+\u2032 (C). This means that for every\n\ng \u2032 , g < g \u2032 < g\u0303, Jg\u2212\u2032 (q) \u2229 C 6= \u2205 and in particular Jg\u2212\u2032 (q) \u2229 C 6= \u2205. However\nT\n(Lemma 3.3 of [12] or use [12, Remark 3.8]), JS\u2212 (q) = g<g\u2032 <g\u0303 Jg\u2212\u2032 (q), thus\nT\nT\nJS\u2212 (q) \u2229 C = g<g\u2032 <g\u0303 (Jg\u2212\u2032 (q) \u2229 C) 6= \u2205 where JS+ := g\u2032 >g Jg+\u2032 is the Seifert\nrelation [21, 12]. Here the last equality follows from the fact that we are taking\nthe intersection of a family of compact sets which satisfies the finite intersection\nproperty (the finite intersection property follows from the fact that given a finite\nfamily of metrics > g there is one with the same property and cones narrower\nthan any element of the family). In a globally hyperbolic spacetime JS+ = J +\n(this result follows from [9, Theorem 2.1], or one can use the stronger results [14]\nthat in a stably causal spacetime JS+ is the smallest closed and transitive relation\nthat contains J + and hence coincides with J + in globally hyperbolic spacetimes.\n4\n\n\fSee also the appendix.). Thus JS\u2212 (q) = J \u2212 (q) from which q \u2208 J + (C) and the\nthesis follows.\nLemma 2.4. A globally hyperbolic spacetime (M, g) admits a sequence of compact sets Kn with the properties (actually (i) follows from (ii))\nS\u221e\n(i) n=0 Kn = M ,\n(ii) If C is a compact set then there is some n \u2265 0 such that C \u2282 Kn ,\n(iii) For n \u2265 0, J + (Kn ) \u2229 J \u2212 (Kn ) \u2282 Int Kn+1 ,\n(iv) There is some metric g0 > g such that (M, g0 ) is stably causal and Jg+0 (K0 )\u2229\nJg\u22120 (K0 ) \u2282 Int K1\nProof. Since M is a second-countable manifold it admits a complete Riemannian\nmetric h [17]. Chosen a point w \u2208 M the closed balls B(w, r) of h-radius r \u2265 0\nare compact by the Hopf-Rinow theorem. Since the Riemannian distance is\ncontinuous it reaches a maximum over a compact set, thus any compact set C\nis contained in some ball B(w, r) for sufficiently large r. Let K0 = {w} and\nr0 = 1 and define inductively Kn+1 = J + (B(w, rn )) \u2229 J \u2212 (B(w, rn )) and rn+1\nto be larger than rn + 1 and such that Kn+1 \u2282 IntB(w, rn+1 ). Clearly for\nn \u2265 1, J + (Kn ) \u2229 J \u2212 (Kn ) \u2282 J + (J + (B(w, rn\u22121 ))) \u2229 J \u2212 (J \u2212 (B(w, rn\u22121 ))) \u2282 Kn\nthus J + (Kn ) \u2229 J \u2212 (Kn ) = Kn . For n = 0 the last equality follows by causality\nusing K0 = {w}. Thus for n \u2265 0, J + (Kn ) \u2229 J \u2212 (Kn ) = Kn \u2282 IntB(w, rn ) \u2282\nIntKn+1 . Furthermore since rn+1 \u2265 rn + 1 property (ii) is satisfied. Finally,\nglobal hyperbolicity implies stable causality and stable causality is stable in the\ninterval topology [12, Lemma 2.2] thus there is g0 > g such that (M, g0 ) is stably\ncausal; furthermore Jg\u00b10 (K0 ) = Jg\u00b10 (w) = Jg\u00b10 (w), where we have used the closure\nof J + in a globally hyperbolic spacetime. By causality Jg+0 (K0 ) \u2229 Jg\u22120 (K0 ) =\n{w} \u2282 IntB(w, 1) \u2282 IntK1 .\nLemma 2.5. Given n \u2265 0 assume there is some metric gn > g such that\nJg+n (Kn ) \u2229 Jg\u2212n (Kn ) \u2282 Int Kn+1 then there is gn+1 > g such that gn+1 \u2264 gn ,\ngn+1 = gn on Kn , and Jg+n+1 (Kn+1 ) \u2229 Jg\u2212n+1 (Kn+1 ) \u2282 Int Kn+2 .\nProof.

The contradiction proves that there is a metric gn+1\n, g < gn+1\n< gn ,\nsuch that\nJg+\u2032 (Kn+1 ) \u2229 Jg\u2212\u2032 (Kn+1 ) \u2229 K\u0307n+2 = \u2205.\nn+1\n\nn+1\n\n5\n\n\f\u2032\nThis equation implies that no gn+1\n-causal curve from Kn+1 can reach K\u0307n+2 and\nend at Kn+1 otherwise there would be some point in Jg+\u2032 (Kn+1 )\u2229Jg\u2212\u2032 (Kn+1 )\u2229\nn+1\n\nK\u0307n+2 .

Redefining\n\n\u2032\n\u2032\ngn+1\nto be in the interval (g, gn+1\n) and using lemma 2.2 one obtains Jg+\u2032\n\nn+1\n\n(Kn+1 )\u2229\n\nJg\u2212\u2032 (Kn+1 )\nn+1\n\n\u2282 IntKn+2 .\n\u2032\nWe can now widen gn+1\non Int Kn+1 so as to make it equal to gn on Kn by\n\u2032\ndefining gn+1 = \u03c7gn+1 +(1\u2212\u03c7)gn where, \u03c7 : M \u2192 [0, 1], is a continuous function\nsuch that \u03c7 = 0 on Kn and \u03c7 = 1 on M \\Int Kn+1 . With this definition gn+1 \u2264\ngn and we still have Jg+n+1 (Kn+1 ) \u2229 Jg\u2212n+1 (Kn+1 ) \u2282 IntKn+2 because the metric\nhas been widened only inside Int Kn+1 so that Jg\u00b1n+1 (Kn+1 ) = Jg\u00b1\u2032 (Kn+1 ).\nn+1\n\nTheorem 2.6. Global hyperbolicity is stable in the interval topology.\nProof. We have to prove that on the globally hyperbolic spacetime (M, g) there\nis some g \u2032 > g such that (M, g \u2032 ) is globally hyperbolic.\nIn the globally hyperbolic spacetime (M, g) there is a sequence of compact\nsets Kn as in lemma 2.4 and a sequence of metrics gn > g, such that gn+1 \u2264\ngn and Jg+n (Kn ) \u2229 Jg\u2212n (Kn ) \u2282 Int Kn+1 . Indeed, condition (iv) in lemma 2.4\nallows us to define inductively the sequence gn thanks to lemma 2.5. We then\ndefine g \u2032 (p) = gn (p) if p \u2208 Kn so that g \u2032 > g. The fact that gn+1 = gn\non Kn proves that g \u2032 is continuous. Furthermore, since for every i, gi+1 \u2264\ngi , we have g \u2032 \u2264 gi for every i. The fact that g \u2032 \u2264 g0 proves that (M, g \u2032 )\nis stably causal (see lemma 2.4 point (iv)) and hence non-total imprisoning.\nIn particular, Jg+\u2032 (Kn ) \u2229 Jg\u2212\u2032 (Kn ) \u2282 Jg+n (Kn ) \u2229 Jg\u2212n (Kn ) \u2282 Int Kn+1 , thus for\nevery pair p, q \u2208 M there is some Kn which contains p and q thus the set\nJg+\u2032 (p) \u2229 Jg\u2212\u2032 (q) \u2282 Jg+\u2032 (Kn ) \u2229 Jg\u2212\u2032 (Kn ) \u2282 Kn+1 has compact closure. We conclude\nthat (M, g \u2032 ) is globally hyperbolic.\nA time function t : M \u2192 R is a continuous function such that x < y \u21d2 t(x) <\nt(y). A Cauchy hypersurface S is a closed acausal set which is intersected by any\ninextendible causal curve. Global hyperbolicity is equivalent to the existence of\na Cauchy hypersurface [8].\nWe recall Geroch's topological splitting of globally hyperbolic spacetimes [5]\n[8, Prop. 6.6.8] which we state in a slightly more detailed form (see remark 2.8).\nTheorem 2.7. Let (M, g) be globally hyperbolic then there is a smooth manifold\nS, a smooth projection \u03c0 : M \u2192 S, a time function t : M \u2192 R, such that\n\u03c6 := (t \u00d7 \u03c0) : M \u2192 R \u00d7 S is a homeomorphism with the property that each\nhypersurface Sa = \u03c6\u22121 ({a} \u00d7 S) is C 1\u2212 and Cauchy, and the fibers \u03c0 \u22121 (s),\ns \u2208 S, are (C 1 ) timelike curves. Furthermore, given a smooth timelike vector\nfield v, the fibers \u03c0 \u22121 (s) can be chosen to be the integral lines of this field.\nRemark 2.8. The last statement, the fact that the projection \u03c0 is actually\nsmooth in Geroch's splitting, and the fact that S is a smooth manifold are\n6\n\n\fnot so often noted. It suffices to multiply the smooth timelike vector field v\nby a smooth spacetime function which makes it complete. The fact that the\nquotient manifold is a smooth manifold and that \u03c0 is smooth is then a standard\nresult from manifold theory [10, Theor. 9.16] as the integral lines of this field\ndo not pass arbitrarily close to themselves (because strong causality holds). We\nshall need this fact only in the stationary case where it has been already used,\nfor instance in [6]. Finally, we remark that one could use also the fact that \u03c0\ninduces a homeomorphism from Sa to S in order to define a smooth structure\non Sa . However, it would not be natural, as the inclusion of Sa (endowed with\nthis smooth structure) in M may be non-smooth.\nRemark 2.9. Thanks to theorem 2.6 this result can be strengthened so that the\nhypersurfaces Sa are strictly acausal (namely there is g \u2032 > g such that Sa are\nacausal in (M, g \u2032 )). In order to see this it suffices to apply the previous theorem\nto (M, g \u2032 ) where g \u2032 > g is such that (M, g \u2032 ) is globally hyperbolic. Then, since\nevery Cauchy hypersurface for (M, g \u2032 ) is a Cauchy hypersurface for (M, g), one\ngets easily the thesis. This observation is important as the possibility of finding\na strictly acausal Cauchy hypersurface in a globally hyperbolic spacetime has\nbeen one of the main difficulties behind the Cauchy hypersurface smoothability\nproblem [2] which essentially asks to prove that, not only the projection \u03c0 :\nM \u2192 S, but also t : M \u2192 R can be found smooth.\n\n2.1\n\nStationary and static spacetimes\n\nLet (M, g) be a spacetime admitting a timelike Killing vector field k. We recall\nthat the timelike Killing field k is twist-free if, defined the 1-form \u03b7 = g(*, k), we\nhave d\u03b7 \u2227 \u03b7 = 0. This Frobenius condition is equivalent\nto the vanishing of the\np\nvorticity tensor wab = hca hdb u[c;d] where u = k/ \u2212g(k, k) and hab = \u03b4ba + ua ub\nis the projector on the vector space perpendicular to u (the equivalence follows\nfrom the fact that w is orthogonal to u thus it vanishes if and only if \u03b5abcd wab uc\nvanishes).\nThe next result shows that in a globally hyperbolic spacetime it is possible\nto widen the light cones preserving both global hyperbolicity and stationarity\n(or staticity).\nTheorem 2.10. Let (M, g) be a globally hyperbolic spacetime admitting a complete timelike Killing vector field k. There is a smooth function \u03b1 : M \u2192 R,\nLk \u03b1 = 0, \u03b1 > 0, such that defined g \u2032 = g \u2212 \u03b1g(*, k) \u2297 g(*, k), we have g \u2032 > g\nand (M, g \u2032 ) is globally hyperbolic. In particular k is timelike and Killing also\nfor (M, g \u2032 ). Finally, if k is also twist-free (hypersurface orthogonality, staticity)\nthen g \u2032 is such that the property is preserved in (M, g \u2032 ).\nProof. Let g\u0303 > g be such that (M, g\u0303) is globally hyperbolic and let us consider\nGeroch's splitting of the spacetime (M, g\u0303) as given in theorem 2.7, \u03c6 = (t \u00d7 \u03c0) :\nM \u2192 R \u00d7 S, where \u03c0 : M \u2192 S is the smooth projection on a smooth quotient\nmanifold such that the fibers are the integral lines of k. The Killing field is\nindeed smooth, that is, it reaches the largest differentiability degree allowed\n\n7\n\n\fby the differentiability properties of the spacetime manifold and the metric,\nbecause for a Killing field: k\u03b2;\u03b1;\u03bc = \u2212R\u03bc\u03bd\u03b1\u03b2 k \u03bd .\nLet Kn be a sequence of compact sets on S such that Kn \u2282 IntKn+1 and\nS = \u222an Kn . Let \u03c6r be the one-parameter group of diffeomorphisms generated\nby k, and let A = {x \u2208 M : x = \u03c6r (s0 ), s0 \u2208 S0 , |r| < 1} where S0 is the\nCauchy hypersurface t = 0 in Geroch's splitting. In other words A is the open\nset between \u03c6\u22121 (S0 ) and \u03c61 (S0 ). We remark that these latter hypersurfaces\nneed not be Cauchy for g\u0303. The sets Cn = A \u2229 \u03c0 \u22121 (Kn ) are compact sets, indeed\nCn is a closed set contained in \u03c6\u22121 ([\u2212j, j] \u00d7 Kj ) for sufficiently large j, and\n\u03c6 = (t \u00d7 \u03c0) is a homeomorphism (more in detail: for each s0 \u2208 \u03c0 \u22121 (Kn ) \u2229 S0\nthe segment of orbit \u03c6r (s0 ), |r| \u2264 1, is compact because of the completeness\nof k and thus the function t reaches a maximum and a minimum on it that\ndepend continuously on s0 , then one uses compactness of \u03c0 \u22121 (Kn ) \u2229 S0 ). Let\ng1/k = g \u2212 k1 g(*, k) \u2297 g(*, k). By compactness and continuity for each n \u2265 1\nthere is some k(n) such that g1/k(n) < g\u0303 on Cn and we can choose k(n) to be\nan increasing function. Let \u03b1\u0303 : S \u2192 (0, +\u221e) be a smooth function such that\n\u03b1\u0303 < 1/k(n) in Kn \\IntKn\u22121 .\nLet us define \u03b1 = \u03c0 \u2217 \u03b1\u0303, so that \u03b1 : M \u2192 (0, +\u221e) is smooth and satisfies\nLk \u03b1 = 0. The expression g \u2032 = g \u2212 \u03b1g(*, k) \u2297 g(*, k) satisfies Lk g \u2032 = 0 on M and\ng \u2032 < g\u0303 on \u0100. In particular the spacetime A with the metric induced from g \u2032 is\nglobally hyperbolic with Cauchy hypersurface S0 .\nNow we are going to prove that any past inextendible timelike curve \u03b3 in\n(M, g \u2032 ) with a point p in the region t > 0 must actually intersect t = 0 which,\ntogether with the dual statement will provide a proof that S0 is a Cauchy\nhypersurface for (M, g \u2032 ). Indeed, let Ar = \u03c6r (A), so that Ar is made by the\nhypersurfaces \u03c6r\u2032 (S0 ), for r \u2212 1 < r\u2032 < r + 1, then each (Ar , g \u2032 |Ar ) is globally\nhyperbolic (simply because it is isometric with A) with Cauchy hypersurface\n\u03c6r (S0 ) (again by isometry). Let \u03c4 > 0 be such that p = \u03c6\u03c4 (s0 ), with s0 \u2208 S0 ,\nthen we can find a finite increasing sequence ri \u2265 0, i = 0, 1, . . . m, r0 = 0,\nrm = \u03c4 such that rk+1 < rk + 1. Let us consider Arm\u22121 . By construction\np belongs to Arm\u22121 and stays in the chronological future of \u03c6rm\u22121 (S0 ) thus \u03b3\nintersects \u03c6rm\u22121 (S0 ) in a point which we denote pm\u22121 . Again by construction\n\u03c6rm\u22121 (S0 ) \u2282 Arm\u22122 thus \u03b3 intersects a point pm\u22122 \u2208 \u03c6rm\u22122 (S0 ). Continuing in\nthis way we conclude, after a finite number of steps, that \u03b3 intersects S0 which\nproves that (M, g \u2032 ) is globally hyperbolic.\nFinally, g \u2032 (*, k) = (1 \u2212 \u03b1g(k, k))g(*, k) thus since (1 \u2212 \u03b1g(k, k)) > 0 the kernel\nof the 1-form g \u2032 (*, k) coincides with the kernel of the 1-form g(*, k). The local\nintegrability of this kernel is the twist-free condition, hence the thesis.\n\n3\n\nCriticism of Geroch's argument\n\nIn its influential paper [5] \"Domains of dependence\" after introducing the concept of domain of dependence and global hyperbolicity, Geroch devoted a section\nto the proof of the stability of global hyperbolicity. In this section we shortly\nreview Geroch's argument clarifying why and where it needs an amendment.\n\n8\n\n\fWe start recalling Geroch's construction of the time function in his topological splitting theorem [15, Sect. 3.7] [8]. Let (M, g) be globally hyperbolic. The\nfirst step is the introduction of a suitable finite volume measure on spacetime\n(the measure m of a complete Riemannian metric h on M would work provided\nit is conformally rescaled to make m(M ) = 1). The functions on M defined by\nt\u2212 (p) = m(I \u2212 (p)) and t+ = \u2212m(I + (p)) can be proved to be time functions. The\nformer goes to zero following any past inextendible curve, while the latter goes\nto zero following any future inextendible curve. The time t appearing in Geroch's topological splitting theorem is t(p) = ln(\u2212t\u2212 (p)/t+ (p)) and is surjective\non R. Geroch proves that every surface Sa = t\u22121 (a) is a Cauchy hypersurface [8,\nProp. 6.6.8] and in order to prove the stability of global hyperbolicity he splits\nthe problem in two parts focusing first in the spacetime region D+ (S0 ) and then\nin D\u2212 (S0 ). His idea is to show that it is possible to widen the cones preserving\nthe Cauchy property of S0 on past inextendible curves in D+ (S0 ). To do this\nhe regards D+ (S0 ) has a countable union of compact sets Kn , constructed as\ncups, whose explicit form is Kn = I \u2212 (Bn ) \u2229 I + (S0 ) where the hypersurface Bn\nis defined by Bn = {p \u2208 M : 1/n = m(I + (p)) \u2264 m(I \u2212 (p))}. He then proves\nthat for each n there is some gn > g such that Jg+n (Kn ) \u2229 Jg\u2212n (Kn ) = Kn ,\nnamely he proves that the compacts Kn are stably causally convex. Ultimately,\nit is the attempt at proving this particularly strong result that causes most\nproblems in Geroch's strategy (in our proof we needed only the weaker result\nJg+n (Kn ) \u2229 Jg\u2212n (Kn ) \u2282 Kn+1 ). From this point the proof is not very detailed but\nit seems that Geroch has in mind a gluing procedure similar to the one that can\nbe found in our proof.\n\nS0\n\nPSfrag replacements\n\n\u03b32\n\nAp\n\n\u03a3\n\u03b31\nS\u2212 ln 2\n\nFigure 1: The spacetime R \u00d7 S 1 of metric ds2 = \u2212dt2 + d\u03b82 . The timelike\ngeodesic \u03b31 maximizes the Lorentzian distance between S\u2212 ln 2 and p while the\ntimelike geodesic \u03b32 maximizes the Lorentzian distance between p and S0 . The\nset A in Geroch's argument is perpendicular to \u03b31 at p and intersects \u03a3 in more\nthan one point.\n9\n\n\fThe problem with his argument is that in order to prove the strong result\nJg+n (Kn )\u2229Jg\u2212n (Kn ) = Kn he has to assume that S0 and Bn are strictly spacelike,\nnamely locally strictly acausal (for each p \u2208 S0 there is an open set O \u220b p, such\nthat S \u2229 O is acausal in (O, g|O )). He thus follows a path that inverts the logical\ndevelopment of our proofs in which our remark 2.9 follows the main theorem\n2.6 on stability. The reader may convince herself that the assumption that\nthe Cauchy hypersurfaces are strictly spacelike is particulary strong, in fact\nas much as the original result on stability that one wishes to prove. Indeed,\nGeroch feels the need of giving an argument which would allow one to replace\nthe hypersurfaces S0 and Bn with strictly spacelike ones.\nThis argument is rather involved and in our opinion does not work. We\nsketch how, according to Geroch, one would have to replace S0 . He suggests\nto consider S\u2212 ln 2 and S0 and to replace S0 with the hypersurface which is\nequidistant from those according to the Lorentzian distance (which in a globally\nhyperbolic spacetime is continuous [1, 13]) \u03a3 = {p \u2208 D+ (S\u2212 ln 2 ) \u2229 D\u2212 (S0 ) :\nd(S\u2212 ln 2 , p) = d(p, S0 )}. His proof that \u03a3 is strictly spacelike goes as follows. He\ntakes p \u2208 \u03a3\\{S0 \u222a S\u2212 ln 2 } and considers the maximal (proper length) timelike\ngeodesic \u03b3 connecting S\u2212 ln 2 to p, i.e. l(\u03b3) = d(S\u2212 ln 2 , p). Then he takes a\nnormal neighborhood O \u220b p and a point q \u2208 \u03b3 \u2229 O, so that q \u2264 p and d(q, p) =\n\u01eb > 0. The set A = {r : d(q, p) = \u01eb} contains p and by the reverse triangle\ninequality for every r \u2208 A, d(S\u2212 ln 2 , r) \u2265 l(\u03b3). From this fact Geroch claims\nthat it follows that \u03a3 is strictly spacelike. It seems that Geroch is assuming that\nA intersects \u03a3 only at p while this is not the case because \u03a3 is not the locus of\npoints at distance l(\u03b3) from S\u2212 ln 2 . As p runs over \u03a3 the length of the maximal\ngeodesic varies. Of course, if A were entirely on the same side of \u03a3 then it would\nbe possible to open the cone at p, but this is not the case as figure 1 shows.\nFurthermore, in order to prove the strict spacelikeness of the hypersurface one\nwould have to prove that the cones can be opened in a whole neighborhood of\np, which could also be troublesome as \u03b3 might not vary continuously with p.\nGeroch's way of replacing the hypersurfaces could be amended by using the\nsmoothability results contained in [2, 3]. One would have to make this replacement for all the Cauchy hypersurfaces appearing in Geroch's proof showing that\nthis step does not really affect the argument. Of course the proof would be no\nmore self contained and would lose simplicity. Our proof is instead more topological and does not even use the notion of time function not to mention the\ntopological splitting of globally hyperbolic spacetimes.\n\n4\n\nConclusions\n\nWe have given a topological proof of the stability of global hyperbolicity in\nGeroch's interval topology. This result implies that every spacetime admits\na Cauchy hypersurface which remains Cauchy for small perturbations of the\nspacetime metric. Moreover, we have proved that the cones can be enlarged\npreserving not only global hyperbolicity but also the presence of a complete\ntimelike Killing field, being it twist-free or not.\n\n10\n\n\fIn our opinion the stability of global hyperbolicity might prove to be important for the investigation of the stability of geodesic singularities and singularity\ntheorems, [11] while its role for predictability issues connected with the cosmic\ncensorship problem[20] seems less clear.\nAt the mathematical level it seems worthwhile to investigate the analogous\nproblem of the stability of causal simplicity. This problem is harder because\nthe property is not preserved by narrowing the light cones, although, examples\nseem to suggest that causal simplicity is indeed stable in the interval topology.\n\nAcknowledgments\nWe thank A. Fathi and A. Siconolfi for some useful discussions on the issue of the\nstability of global hyperbolicity. Their suggestions have allowed us to simplify\nthe proof. This work1 has been partially supported by GNFM of INDAM under\nproject Giovani Ricercatori 2009 \"Stable and generic properties in relativity\".\n\nAppendix\nT\nThe Seifert relation is defined by JS+ = g\u2032 >g Jg+\u2032 . In lemma 2.3 we have used\nthe equivalence JS+ = J + which holds in globally hyperbolic spacetimes. We\nare going to give a proof of this fact which is similar to [9, Theorem 2.1], but\ndoes not use the geodesic triangulation.\nWe recall that in a globally hyperbolic spacetime the Lorentzian distance\nd : M \u00d7 M \u2192 [0, +\u221e] is finite, continuous and maximized by a connecting\ngeodesic [1].\nTheorem 4.1. In a globally hyperbolic spacetime JS+ = J + .\nProof. Assume that: \"if x \u226a y then there is g \u2032 > g such that Jg+\u2032 (y) \u2282 I + (x)\".\nFrom this assumption it follows JS+ (y) \u2282 I + (x) \u2282 J + (x). Taking the limit\nx \u2192 y and using J + = J + , JS+ (y) \u2282 J + (y) the other inclusion being obvious.\nIt remains to prove x \u226a y \u21d2 there is g \u2032 > g such that Jg+\u2032 (y) \u2282 I + (x).\nLet us define for 0 < k < 1, Sk = {w : d(x, w) = kd(x, y)}. We have that\nI + (Sk ) = {w : d(x, w) > kd(x, y)}, and Sk = \u2202I + (Sk ), in particular Sk is an\nachronal boundary and J + (y) \u2282 I + (Sk ), Sk \u2282 I + (x). It is trivial to establish\nthat Sk is actually acausal. We are going to find a strictly spacelike hypersurface\nS\u0303 \u2282 I + (S1/3 )\u2229I \u2212 (S2/3 ) (see figure 2). Using the results of [2] it would be trivial\n1 (Note not included in the published version.)

Apparently, the referee was very conservative and did not judge positively\nthe possibility of proving the stability of global hyperbolicity without passing through smoothing arguments. We argued that in fact the right approach should be the opposite, which we\nadvocate in remark 2.9, namely to prove topologically that global hyperbolicity is stable and\nthen to prove, as a last step, that smooth time functions exist. This strategy has been successfully followed in the recent paper by A. Fathi and A. Siconolfi: On smooth time functions,\nto appear in Math. Proc. Camb. Phil. Soc., see e.g. Eq. (32) of that work.\n\n11\n\n\fsince it is easy to establish that S1/3 and S2/3 are Cauchy hypersurfaces for the\nspacetime I + (x), and there is always a smooth spacelike hypersurface between\ntwo Cauchy hypersurfaces, one in the future of the other [2, Prop. 14]. We shall\nhowever give a self contained proof.\nFor every point q \u2208 S2/3 let p(q) be the intersection between a (make any\nchoice) maximal geodesic \u03c3 connecting x to q and S1/3 . By the reverse triangle\ninequality this segment from x to p is also maximal and since p \u2208 S1/3 , it has\nlength d(x, y)/3, thus the remaining part of the segment, connecting p to q has\nlength d(x, y)/3. For \u01eb, 0 < \u01eb < d(x, y)/3 sufficiently small we can find a point\nr(q) \u2208 \u03c3 at a distance \u01eb from q so that r is included in a relatively compact\nconvex neighborhood Cq of q.\nMoreover, keeping Cq , there must be an even smaller \u01eb such that (r is at\ndistance \u01eb from q) J + (r)\u2229J \u2212 (S2/3 ) \u2282 Cq . Indeed if for every \u01eb > 0 there is some\ns(\u01eb) \u2208 J + (r) \u2229 J \u2212 (S2/3 ) \u2229 M \\Cq then connecting r(\u01eb) to s(\u01eb) with a maximal\ngeodesic, using the closure of J + in a globally hyperbolic spacetime and taking\nthe limit \u01eb \u2192 0 (which implies r(q) \u2192 q) we could find a point s\u0303 \u2208 \u010aq \u2229J \u2212 (S2/3 )\nin the causal future of q which is a contradiction with the acausality of S2/3 .\n\nS2/3\n\nPSfrag replacements\nS1/3\nS\u0303\n\nCq\n\nq\nr\n\nx\nFigure 2: The construction of the strictly spacelike hypersurface in the proof of\ntheorem 4.1.\nBy the global hyperbolicity of (M, g) as S2/3 \u2229 Cq is compact J + (r) \u2229\nJ (S2/3 ) \u2282 J + (r) \u2229 J \u2212 (S2/3 \u2229 Cq and hence J + (r) \u2229 J \u2212 (S2/3 ) is compact.\nThus for sufficiently small \u01eb the set S2/3 \u2229 I + (r) is non-empty, as it contains\nq, and open relatively compact in the topology of S2/3 \u2229 Cq and furthermore\nJ + (r) \u2229 J \u2212 (S2/3 ) is a compact set contained in Cq . In particular A(q) = {w :\nd(r(q), w) = \u01eb/2} \u2229 I \u2212 (S2/3 ) \u2282 Cq is differentiable with spacelike tangent by a\nproperty of the distance in a convex set (Gauss lemma [8, Lemma 4.5.2]). The\nopen sets O(q) = {w : d(r(q), w) > d(r(q), q)/2} \u2229 S2/3 cover S2/3 . Since S is\n\u03c3-compact we can pass to S\na locally finite countable covering O(qi ).\n(*) The set S\u0303 = \u2202I + ( i A(qi )) is a gluing of the hypersurfaces A(qi ). In\nthe convex set Cqi the cones can be opened keeping A(qi ) spacelike and since\n\u2212\n\n12\n\n\flocally only a finite number of Cq intersect, the same is true for S\u0303. (It must be\nnoted that by gluing the sets A(qi ) instead of summing the associated distance\nfunctions from ri we don't have to deal with some subtleties related to the fact\nthat the squared Lorentzian distance is not C 1 where it vanishes.)\n(**) Alternatively, instead of using route (*) we can define the function\nhi (z) = [d(ri , z)/d(ri , qi )]4 if z \u2208 J \u2212 (S2/3 ) (which implies z \u2208 Cqi or hi (z) = 0)\nand hi (z) = +\u221e if z \u2208 I + (S2/3 ). The function hi is a C 1 time function\nwherever it is finite and furthermore it has a timelike gradient wherever it is\ndifferent from zero (it is sometimes said that d2 is C 1 but this is false at the\npoints where the Lorentzian distance vanishes). In order to check that hi is\nC 1 it suffices to use normal coordinates at r and [18, Lemma\n5.9] according to\nP\nwhich hi = [(x0 )2 \u2212 (x1 )2 * * * \u2212 (xn\u22121 )2 ]2 . Defined t = i hi the function t is a\nC 1 has (past directed) timelike gradient where it is different from zero, and by\nconstruction (see the definition of O(q)) it takes on S2/3 a value greater than\n1/24 . Thus at S\u0303 = t\u22121 (1/25 ) the function t is C 1 with a timelike gradient.\nFor the last step, we find g \u2032 > g such that S\u0303 is locally g \u2032 -acausal. No g \u2032 -causal\ncurve issued from y can cross S\u0303 thus Jg+\u2032 (y) \u2282 I + (S1/2 ) \u2282 I + (x).\n\nReferences\n[1] Beem, J. K., Ehrlich, P. E., and Easley, K.
