During the dynamical evolution of heavy ion collisions (HIC) at intermediate and high\nenergies, a transient state of hot and dense nuclear matter can be produced and therefore\nthe experiments with HIC are powerful tools for constraining the nuclear EOS [4]. Since the\nEOS can not be measured directly in the experiments, one has to compare the experimental\nobservables and the theoretical simulations by using transport models [5]. The single-particle\n(s.p.) potential felt by a nucleon in the nuclear medium is one of the basic ingredients of\ntransport models for HIC and controls together with the nucleon-nucleon cross sections the\ncollision dynamics.\nMicroscopically the s.p. potential in cold nuclear matter has been investigated by many\nauthors based on microscopic theoretical approaches [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]. It has been pointed\nout [11] that the s.p. potential calculated at the lowest level of the Brueckner-Hartree-Fock\n(BHF) approximation cannot describe with sufficient accuracy the mean field, but it is necessary to include higher-order ground state correlations. In Refs. [6, 12], the effect of the\nground-state correlations on the s.p. potential has been investigated within the BruecknerBethe-Goldstone (BGG) theory. Therein it is shown that inclusion of the rearrangement\ncontribution in the s.p. potential is also crucial for restoring the Hugenholtz-Van Hove theorem, which is strongly violated at the lowest BHF level of approximation. The importance of\nthe rearrangement term in the hole-line expansion of the mass operator has also been verified\nin Refs. [13, 14, 15] in connection with the optical model potential, the s.p. properties in\nthe nuclear medium such as the nucleon effective mass and the nucleon mean free path, and\nthe superfluidity properties in neutron matter and nuclear matter. Recently, the calculation\nof the high-order correlations in the mass operator has been extended to the case of isospin\nasymmetric nuclear matter at zero temperature [9] within the extended BHF approach.\nNowadays it is widely recognized that dressing in a non-relativistic framework the interaction with short-range correlations, either G-matrix [1] or in-medium T-matrix [16, 17, 18, 19],\nis not enough to reproduce the empirical saturation properties of cold nuclear matter. The\nsaturation mechanism demands for the high-density repulsive contribution of the threebody force (TBF) [20, 21]. Microscopic TBF [21] have been used in Brueckner calculations\n[22, 23]. Phenomenological versions of TBF have also been used mainly in variational approaches [24]. In Ref. [25] we have extended the BHF approach with microscopic TBF to\nfinite temperature and investigated the EOS of hot nuclear matter. It was shown that the\nTBF affect considerably the properties of hot nuclear matter especially at high densities and\ntemperatures. The aim of the present paper is to extend our previous work by including the\neffect of the ground state correlations in the calculation of the single-nucleon properties.\nThe paper is arranged as follows. In the next section II we shall give a brief review of\nour theoretical model including the finite-temperature BHF approach with a microscopic\nTBF and the hole-line expansion for the mass operator at finite temperature [13, 26]. Our\nnumerical results are presented and discussed in Sect. III, including the rearrangement term\nand its temperature dependence, the TBF effect on the ground state correlations and the\ns.p. potential. Finally, a summary will be given in Sect. IV along with a short comparison\nwith other approaches.\n\n2\n\n\fII.\n\nTHEORETICAL MODEL\nA.\n\nFinite-temperature Brueckner-Hartree-Fock approach with a three-body force\n\nThe general formalism of the Brueckner-Bethe-Goldstone (BBG) theory for cold nuclear\nmatter can be found in Refs. [8, 9] and its extension to the finite temperature case is given\nin Ref. [27]. Here we give a brief review for completeness. The starting point of the BBG\nscheme is the Brueckner reaction G-matrix, which satisfies the following Bethe-Goldstone\n(BG) equation,\nG[\u03c1, T, \u03c9] = V + V\n\nX |k1 k2 iQ(k1 , k2 , \u03c1, T )hk1k2 |\n\u03c9 \u2212 \u03b5(k1 ) \u2212 \u03b5(k2 ) + i0\n\nk1 k2\n\nG[\u03c1, T, \u03c9] ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03c9 is the starting energy and V denotes the realistic nucleon-nucleon (NN) interaction.\nThe finite-temperature Pauli operator Q can be expressed as\nQ(k1 , k2 , \u03c1, T ) = [1 \u2212 f (k1 )] [1 \u2212 f (k2 )] ,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere f (k) is the Fermi distribution at finite temperature,\n\u0014\n\nf (k) = 1 + exp\n\n\u0012\n\n\u03b5(k) \u2212 \u03bc\nT\n\n\u0013\u0015\u22121\n\n.\n\n(3)\n\nIn terms of the normalization condition,\n\u03c1=\n\nX\n\nf (k) ,\n\n(4)\n\nk\n\none can determine the chemical potential \u03bc self-consistently by iteration for any given density\n\u03c1 and temperature T . The s.p. energy \u03b5(k) in Eqs. (1) and (3) is defined as\n\u03b5(k) \u2261 \u03b5(k, \u03c1, T ) =\n\nk2\n+ U(k, \u03c1, T ) ,\n2m\n\n(5)\n\nwhere the s.p. potential U(k, \u03c1, T ) may be calculated from the real part of the on-shell\nanti-symmetrized G-matrix,\nX\nU(k, \u03c1, T ) =\nf (k \u2032 ) Re hkk \u2032 | G[\u03c1, T, \u03b5(k) + \u03b5(k \u2032 )] |kk \u2032 iA .\n(6)\nk\u2032\n\nIn the present calculations, the continuous choice [13] is adopted for the s.p. potential.\nOn the one hand, in the zero temperature limit it provides a much faster convergence of\nthe hole-line expansion than the gap choice [28]; on the other hand, it appears a natural\nchoice for T 6= 0, since in the finite-temperature case any distinction between particles and\nholes becomes meaningless. Within the continuous choice the s.p. potential describes at the\nBHF level the mean field felt by a nucleon during its propagation between two successive\nscatterings in the nuclear medium [29].\nThe NN interaction V in the present calculation contains two parts: the Argonne V18\n[30] or the Nijmegen 93 [31] two-body interaction plus the contribution of a microscopic\n3\n\n\fTBF. Two kinds of TBF have been adopted in the BHF formalism: One is the semiphenomenological Urbana TBF [32], which has two or few adjustable parameters determined\nby fitting the empirical saturation density and energy of cold symmetric nuclear matter in\nthe BHF calculations [23, 33, 34]. The other one (used here) is a microscopic TBF based\non meson exchange coupled to intermediate virtual excitations of nucleon-antinucleon pairs\nand nucleon resonances, which was originally proposed in [21]. It contains the contribution\nof the two-meson exchange part of the NN interaction medium-modified by the intermediate\nvirtual excitation of nucleon resonances, the term associated to the non-linear meson-nucleon\ncoupling required by chiral symmetry, the simplest contribution arising from meson-meson\ninteractions, and finally the two-meson exchange diagram with the virtual excitations of\nnucleon-antinucleon pairs. In this TBF model, the four important mesons \u03c0, \u03c1, \u03c3, and \u03c9\nare considered [35]. The parameters of the TBF, i.e., the coupling constants and the form\nfactors, have been redetermined recently in Ref. [22] from the one-boson-exchange potential\n(OBEP) model to meet the self-consistent requirement with the adopted two-body force.\nA more detailed description of the TBF model and the approximations can be found in\nRef. [21].\nIn the zero-temperature case, the TBF contribution W3 has been included in the BHF\ncalculations by constructing an effective two-body interaction V3 via a suitable average with\nrespect to the third-nucleon degrees of freedom [20, 21]. By extending this scheme to finite\ntemperature, one can reduce the TBF to a temperature-dependent effective two-body force\nV3 (T ), which reads in r-space [25]\nZ\n1 X\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032 \u2032\nf (kn ) dr3 dr3\u2032 \u03c6\u2217n (r3\u2032 ) [1 \u2212 \u03b7(r13\n, T )] [1 \u2212 \u03b7(r23\n, T )]\nhr1 r2 |V3 (T )|r1r2 i = Tr\n4\nkn\n\n\u00d7 W3 (r1\u2032 r2\u2032 r3\u2032 |r1 r2 r3 )\u03c6n (r3 )[1 \u2212 \u03b7(r13 , T )][1 \u2212 \u03b7(r23 , T )] ,\n\n(7)\n\nwhere the trace is taken with respect to the spin and isospin of the third nucleon. The defect\nfunction \u03b7(r, T ) [20, 21] is defined as \u03b7(r, T ) = \u03c6(r) \u2212 \u03c8(r, T ), where \u03c8(r, T ) is the correlated\nwave function for the relative motion of two nucleons in the nuclear medium and \u03c6(r) is\nthe corresponding unperturbed one. A detailed description and justification of the above\nscheme can be found in Ref. [21]. As has been pointed out in Refs. [25, 36], the TBF W3\nitself is the same as the one adopted in our previous calculations for the zero-temperature\ncase [22] and is independent of temperature. However, in the finite-temperature case, the\neffective two-body force V3 (T ) depends on temperature due to the medium effects caused by\nthe Fermi distribution f (k) and the defect function \u03b7(r, T ), which is strongly temperature\ndependent.\nIn the BHF approximation with the TBF, Eqs. (1) and (5-7) are solved self-consistently.\nFirst, the temperature-dependent G-matrix is calculated along with the auxiliary potential\nby solving the BG equation, then one evaluates the defect function with only the two-body\nforce, further constructs the effective two-body force, and finally adds the effective two-body\nforce to the bare two-body force. This procedure is repeated until convergence is reached.\nObviously, the effect of microscopic TBF is automatically included into the G-matrix by\niteration.\n\n4\n\n\fB.\n\nHole-line expansion of the mass operator\n\nWithin the BBG theory the mass operator can be expanded into a perturbation series in\nterms of the number of hole lines [13, 37, 38]:\nM(k, \u03c9) = M1 (k, \u03c9) + M2 (k, \u03c9) + M3 (k, \u03c9) + . . . ,\n\n(8)\n\nwhich is schematically illustrated in Fig. 1. In this expansion the two-hole line contribution\nM2 (k, \u03c9) is the so-called rearrangement term, representing the Pauli rearrangement, i.e., the\nmedium dependence of the effective G-matrix interaction via the ground state Pauli blocking\neffect. The third-order term M3 (k, \u03c9) accounts for the fact that the hole state is partially\nempty in the correlated ground state of nuclear matter [7, 13].\nThe mass operator M(k, \u03c9) = V (k, \u03c9) + iW (k, \u03c9) is a complex quantity. When evaluated\non the energy shell, its real part V (k) \u2261 V (k, \u03b5(k)) describes the s.p. potential felt by a\nnucleon in the nuclear medium and can be compared with the empirical potential depth extracted from the optical potential model [39], whereas its imaginary part W (k) \u2261 W (k, \u03b5(k))\nis related to the nucleon mean free path [9, 13, 14]. The on-shell condition is given by the\nfollowing energy-momentum relation [9],\nk2\n+ Re M(k, \u03c9) = \u03c9 .\n2m\n\n(9)\n\nTo the lowest order of approximation, the on-shell condition is simplified as k 2/2m +\nRe M(k, \u03b5(k)) = \u03b5(k), where \u03b5(k) is the BHF s.p. energy. In the present work, we shall\nconsider only the on-shell properties of the mass operator. Hereafter we denote the real\nand imaginary parts of the on-shell mass operator as V (k) and W (k), respectively. Their\nhole-line expansions can be written as\nV (k) = V1 (k) + V2 (k) + V3 (k) + . . . ,\nW (k) = W1 (k) + W2 (k) + W3 (k) + . . . .\n\n(10)\n(11)\n\nSince the renormalization contribution M3 (k) is quite small compared to the lowestorder BHF term M1 (k) and the rearrangement term M2 (k) [9, 38], in the present paper\nwe concentrate on the investigation of the rearrangement contribution M2 (k), which in the\nfinite-temperature case can be expressed as follows,\nM2 (k1 , \u03c9) =\n\n1 X\n|hk1 k2 |G|k1\u2032 k2\u2032 iA |2\n[1 \u2212 f (k2)]f (k1\u2032 )f (k2\u2032 )\n.\n2 \u2032 \u2032\n\u03c9 + \u03b5(k1 ) \u2212 \u03b5(k1\u2032 ) \u2212 \u03b5(k2\u2032 ) + i0\n\n(12)\n\nk2 k1 k2\n\nBy using the usual angular averaging procedure in order to remove the angular dependence\nof the energy denominator and the anti-Pauli operator [1, 40, 41], M2 (k, \u03c9) can be readily\ncalculated in terms of the G-matrix expanded in the partial wave representation [9, 38]:\nZ\nZ\nh\ni\np\n2 X\nM2 (k, \u03c9) = 2\n(2J + 1) qdq P dP 1 \u2212 f ( P 2/2 + 2q 2 \u2212 k 2 )\n\u03c0 k JST LL\u2032\nZ\n2\n\u2032\n\u2032\n|GJST\n\u20322\n\u2032\n\u2032\nLL\u2032 [q, q , P, \u03b512 (q , P )]|\np\n,\n(13)\n\u00d7 q dq R(q , P )\n\u03c9 + \u03b5( P 2/2 + 2q 2 \u2212 k 2 ) \u2212 \u03b512 (q \u2032 , P ) + i0\n5\n\n\fwhere q \u2032 = (k1 \u2212 k2 )/2 and P = k1 + k2 are the relative and total momenta, respectively. In the above equation, \u03b512 (q \u2032 , P ) \u2261 h\u03b5(k1) + \u03b5(k2)i denotes the angular average of the energy\nR \u03c0 denominator and the angular-averaged anti-Pauli operator is defined as\nR(q \u2032 , P ) \u2261 21 0 sin \u03b8d\u03b8f (k1 )f (k2 ), where \u03b8 is the angle between q \u2032 and P .\nThus in terms of the G-matrix obtained from Eq. (1), the first- and second-order contributions in the hole-line expansion of the mass operator can be calculated. Hereafter we shall\ndenote the on-shell mass operator containing the contribution of the rearrangement term as\nM12 (k) = M1 (k) + M2 (k), and its real and imaginary parts as V12 (k) = V1 (k) + V2 (k) and\nW12 (k) = W1 (k) + W2 (k), respectively.\nIII.\n\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION\n\nThe self-consistent BHF procedure extended to TBF has been applied to study symmetric nuclear matter at finite temperature. Two realistic interactions, the Argonne V18 and\nNijmegen 93 potentials, have been used to describe the two-body force, whereas the model\nof TBF is the meson exchange interaction discussed in Sec. IIA. The results for the EOS\nhave been presented elsewhere [22]. Here we only report the saturation properties: The\nmain effect of TBF is to reduce the saturation density from 0.26 fm\u22123 to 0.19 fm\u22123 due to\nthe high-density extra repulsion. The energy per particle rises from \u221218 MeV to \u221215 MeV,\nwhereas the compression modulus is lowered from 230 MeV to 210 MeV.\nA.\n\nRearrangement contribution\n\nIn Fig. 2 are plotted the real and imaginary parts of the rearrangement contribution\nM2 (k). It is seen that they depend sensitively on temperature in both cases with and\nwithout including the TBF contribution. The real part of M2 (k), i.e., the rearrangement\nterm V2 (k) of the s.p. potential is repulsive and its contribution is mainly concentrated in\nthe region below the Fermi momentum kF , where the ground state hole-hole correlations\nare expected to be most effective. Around kF the magnitude of V2 (k) decreases rapidly as a\nfunction of momentum and vanishes at high enough momentum. As the nuclear matter is\nheated up, V2 (k) is strongly reduced due to the softening of the Pauli blocking around the\nFermi surface at high temperature, which weakens the effect of the ground state hole-hole\ncorrelations.\nAlso the TBF contribution suppresses considerably these correlations in cold and hot\nnuclear matter due to its strong short-range repulsion, and leads to a sizable reduction of\nthe rearrangement correction V2 (k). This feature is much more pronounced in the lowmomentum region, where the ground state correlations are more significant. The influence\nof the TBF diminishes as the temperature increases, since the ground state correlations\nthemselves become smaller at higher temperature. For instance, in the case of the V18\npotential, at T = 0, the reduction of V2 (k = 0) due to the TBF is about 6 MeV, from\n30 MeV to 24 MeV, while at T = 20 MeV, the reduction is about 3 MeV, from 13 to 10\nMeV. Comparing the curves in the upper panels with the corresponding ones in the lower\npanels, it is readily seen that in both cases with the V18 potential and with the Nijmegen\n93 potential, the influence of the TBF decreases as the temperature rises, implying that the\ntemperature dependence of the TBF effect on the correlation potential V2 (k) is not much\nsensitive to the adopted two-body realistic NN interactions. However, the effect of the TBF\n6\n\n\fis more pronounced in the case with the Nijmegen 93 potential in the temperature range\nconsidered here.\nThe imaginary part W2 (k) of M2 (k) is related directly to the lifetime or the width of a\nhole state [13], which vanishes above the Fermi momentum kF for cold nuclear matter due to\nthe Pauli blocking effect [9]. However, at finite temperature, the tail of W2 slightly extends\nto the momentum region above the Fermi surface, since the Fermi surface becomes diffusive\nand the Pauli blocking is weakened in this case. The temperature dependence of W2 (k) is\nsomewhat more complicated than that of the real part V2 (k). With increasing temperature,\nW2 (k) gets smaller in the momentum region well below kF , while it becomes larger in the\nupper part of the Fermi sea. This can be explained as follows. On the one hand, the ground\nstate hole-hole correlations decrease with temperature. On the other hand, at a higher\ntemperature, a hole state intends to decay faster, especially close to the Fermi surface. The\ncompetition between these two effects determines the final variation of W2 (k) as a function\nof temperature. The TBF suppresses somewhat the ground state hole-hole correlations and\nits contribution reduces the magnitude of the imaginary part W2 (k) in agreement with the\nresults obtained for the real part of M2 (k).\nIn order to discuss the density dependence, we report in Fig. 3 the rearrangement contribution M2 at the fixed momentum k = 0 as a function of density for the two cases with and\nwithout the TBF. It is seen that the real and the imaginary parts of M2 (k) increase monotonically with density in both cases, indicating that the effect of the ground state hole-hole\ncorrelations is stronger in denser nuclear matter, where the number of hole state is larger.\nThe TBF leads to a reduction of the ground state correlations in the whole density region\nconsidered. Its effect is fairly small at low densities and becomes stronger rapidly as the\ndensity increases.\nB.\n\nMass operator\n\nThe complex mass operator M12 (k) including the BHF contribution and the rearrangement term is reported in Fig. 4 for several different values of density and two temperatures\nT = 0, 20 MeV. Since the real part of the rearrangement term is repulsive, its contribution\nreduces to a large extent the attraction of the pure BHF s.p. potential V1 (k) [25]. In the zerotemperature case at normal nuclear matter density \u03c1 = 0.17 fm\u22123 , the repulsive contribution\nof the ground state correlations causes the depth of the s.p. potential V12 (k = 0) to rise to\n\u2248 \u221260 MeV from its BHF value V1 (k = 0) \u2248 \u221285 MeV [9]. This improves considerably the\nagreement of our predicted s.p. potential with the optical model potential extracted from\nnucleon-nucleus scattering experiments [13, 39]. As the nuclear density increases, the total\npotential V12 (k) becomes more attractive in the low-momentum region, while at high enough\nmomenta it becomes slightly less attractive. Such a density dependence is mainly attributed\nto the density behavior of the pure BHF s.p. potential V1 (k), as in the zero-temperature\ncase [2].\nConcerning the temperature dependence, it is seen from Fig. 4 that in the case without\nTBF, the total potential becomes more attractive at low momenta and less attractive in the\nhigh momentum region above kF when the nuclear matter is heated up. This is quite different\nfrom the temperature behavior of the lowest-order BHF s.p. potential, where an increase in\ntemperature results in an overall reduction of the attraction of the BHF s.p. potential in the\nwhole momentum region [25]. At low momenta, the enhancement of the attraction of V12 (k)\nwith temperature is readily understood in terms of the temperature effect on the ground\n7\n\n\fstate correlations: The correlation potential V2 (k) applies mainly to states below the Fermi\nmomentum and its repulsive contribution is reduced largely by increasing temperature as\nshown in Fig. 2. At high momenta, the contribution of V2 (k) is very small and consequently\nthe variation of the total potential V12 (k) with temperature is essentially determined by that\nof the BHF potential V1 (k).\nAt low densities (for example, \u03c1 = 0.085 fm\u22123 ), the TBF effect is fairly weak. However,\nat high densities, the TBF modification of the s.p. potential becomes significant, especially\nfor high temperatures. In the two cases of \u03c1 = 0.225 and 0.34 fm\u22123 , inclusion of the TBF\ncontribution even makes the temperature behavior of V12 (k) quite different from that without\nTBF. It can been seen from the figure that the calculated V12 with the TBF contribution gets\nmore repulsive in the whole momentum region. This may be understood as a consequence\nof the competition between the following two effects. Below the Fermi momentum, the TBF\nsuppresses the ground state hole-hole correlations due to its strong short-range repulsion\nand thus it reduces the repulsive contribution of the rearrangement term V2 (k). On the\nother hand, the TBF contribution to the BHF s.p. potential V1 (k) is repulsive and reduces\nthe attraction of V1 (k). At high densities, as the temperature increases, the TBF effect\non the ground state correlations becomes weaker while its contribution to the pure BHF\ns.p. potential V1 (k) gets larger. Above the Fermi momentum, the correlation term V2 (k)\ntends to vanish and the temperature dependence of the total potential V12 is dominated by\nthe BHF one V1 (k). Accordingly at high densities the total potential gets more repulsive\nin the whole momentum region as the matter is heated. Another feature related to the\ntemperature dependence that can be observed from Fig. 4 is that the curvature around the\nFermi momentum becomes more smooth with increasing temperature in both cases with\nand without TBF, which is in agreement with the prediction obtained for the pure BHF\ns.p. potential [20, 25] and is attributed to the thermal excitations around the Fermi surface\nat finite temperature.\nNow let us turn to the imaginary part W12 , which is also called absorptive potential\n[13]. It is seen from Fig. 4 that for cold nuclear matter the absorptive potential crosses\nzero at the Fermi momentum kF . The BHF contribution W1 (k) vanishes below kF and the\ncorrelation term W2 (k) above kF due to the Pauli blocking. At finite temperature, W1 (k)\nmay extend to the momentum region below kF and W2 (k) to above kF . The total absorptive\npotential crosses zero at a momentum close to kF , since the chemical potential does not\nchange very much up to T = 20 MeV [38]. For each fixed density considered here, the\nabsolute value of W12 (k) increases above the Fermi momentum kF while it decreases below\nkF . The temperature dependence of W12 (k) turns out to be stronger in nuclear matter with\na smaller density. As expected, the TBF effect on the imaginary part W12 (k) increases with\ndensity, while it is relatively weak compared to that on the real part V12 (k), especially at\nhigh densities.\nIt is instructive to make a comparison with the predictions of the in-medium T-matrix approach, where the self-energy is self-consistently calculated with the T-matrix [16, 17, 18, 19].\nThe main difference from the G-matrix is that the T-matrix embodies both particle-particle\nand hole-hole correlations. Since its convergence is not protected by any hole line expansion, one needs a very accurate determination of the self-energy. Also, zero-temperature\ncalculations are usually not possible in this approach without removing in some way the too\nstrong pairing instabilities. Doing so, however, nuclear matter appears to be underbound\n[17, 18, 19]. Concerning the s.p. properties, one observes an overall qualitative agreement\nbetween the T-matrix self-energy and the Brueckner one (see for instance Fig. 5 of Ref. [17]\n8\n\n\for Fig. 13 of Ref. [18]), which is an indication that the rearrangement term contains most\nof the hole-hole correlations.\nC.\n\nEffective mass\n\nThe effective mass describes the nonlocality of the s.p. potential and makes its local part\nless attractive. It is of great interest [42], since it is closely related with many nuclear phenomena such as the dynamics of heavy ion collisions at intermediate and high energies [43],\nthe damping of nuclear excitations and giant resonances [44], and the adiabatic temperature\nof collapsing stellar matter [45]. The effective mass m\u2217 (k) is defined as [13]\n\u0014\n\u0015\u22121\nm\u2217 (k)\nk dE(k)\n=\n,\n(14)\nm\nm\ndk\nwhere E(k) is the s.p. energy determined by the momentum-energy relation Eq. (9). When\nthe mass operator is expanded up to the second order, one can readily calculate the effective\nmass as follows:\n\u0015\u22121\n\u0014\nm\u2217 (k)\nm dV12 (k)\n= 1+\n.\n(15)\nm\nk dk\nThe calculated m\u2217 (k)/m versus momentum is reported in Fig. 5, where the upper panel\nshows the results for nuclear matter at the empirical saturation density \u03c1 = 0.17 fm\u22123 and\nfor two temperatures T = 0, 20 MeV with and without including TBF, while the lower\npanel displays the results for three values of density \u03c1 = 0.085, 0.17, and 0.34 fm\u22123 at zero\ntemperature. Due to the high possibility for particle-hole excitations near the Fermi surface\n[13], the momentum dependence of m\u2217 (k)/m in cold nuclear matter is characterized by a\nwide bump around the Fermi momentum kF . Recently such a structure has also been found\n[46] within the relativistic Dirac-Brueckner-Hartree-Fock approach for the momentum dependence of the non-relativistic type of effective mass introduced in terms of the Schr\u00f6dinger\nequivalent s.p. potential [39]. Inclusion of the contribution of the rearrangement term makes\nthe peak of the effective mass more pronounced as compared to the results obtained at the\nlowest BHF level of approximation [25], consistent with previous investigations adopting\npure two-body NN interactions [6, 9, 13, 38]. The value m\u2217F \u2261 m\u2217 (kF ) of the effective mass\nobtained in the present calculation is around 1.02 when the TBF contribution is included\nand 1.08 in the case without the TBF. Both values are larger than the BHF value \u2248 0.8\n[9], which is mainly attributed to the contribution of the ground state correlations, i.e.,\nthe arrangement term V2 (k). Inclusion of even higher-order terms, i.e., the third- and the\nfourth-order terms in the hole-line expansion of the mass operator may reduce m\u2217F /m to\nabout 0.9 as discussed in Ref. [9].\nAs the nuclear matter is heated, the peak of m\u2217 (k) becomes flatter and the peak value\nlower, which is related directly to the temperature effect on the s.p. potential V12 around the\nFermi momentum and is similar to the result obtained at the BHF level of approximation\n[25]. It is seen that in the case of T = 20 MeV the peak structure almost disappears.\nThe TBF effect on the effective mass is significant only at low temperatures and in the\nlow-momentum region below kF , because the TBF effect on the BHF s.p. potential V1 (k)\nis an overall enhancement in the whole momentum region [25] and thus the momentumdependence of the total potential V12 (k) is mainly affected by the correlation potential\nV2 (k), which is important below kF . As the temperature increases, the correlation potential\n9\n\n\fV2 (k) itself and the influence of the TBF on it become weaker as has been shown in Fig. 2,\nand as a result also the TBF effect on the effective mass is smaller at higher temperature.\nFrom the lower part of Fig. 5 it is clear that with increasing density the peak structure of\nthe effective mass around kF becomes less pronounced and the value of the effective mass at\nkF decreases, which is comparable with the previous calculations adopting pure two-body\nnucleon-nucleon forces [6, 14].\nIV.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nIn the present work, we have reported the investigation of the s.p. properties for cold as\nwell as hot nuclear matter within the framework of the Brueckner theory by adopting the\nArgonne V18 or the Nijmegen 93 two-body nucleon-nucleon interaction plus a microscopic\nthree-body force based on the meson-exchange model. The mass operator has been calculated up to the second order of the hole-line expansion. Special attention has been paid to\nthe effect of ground state correlations on the s.p. potential in hot nuclear matter and the\ninfluence of the TBF on the ground state correlations. Our result shows that these correlations give a repulsive contribution to the s.p. potential mainly within the Fermi sphere in\nagreement with previous investigations [9, 13]. As the temperature rises, the real and the\nimaginary part of the rearrangement contribution become less repulsive due to the weakening\nof the correlations.\nThe TBF contribution turns out to reduce the two-hole line correlation term in magnitude\ndue to its strong short-range repulsion. When the nuclear matter is heated, the TBF effect on\nthe ground state correlations becomes weaker. At T = 0, the imaginary part of the secondorder mass operator vanishes below the Fermi surface due to the Pauli blocking, while in the\nfinite-temperature case its tail may extend slightly above the Fermi momentum, since the\nFermi surface becomes diffusive and the Pauli blocking is weakened. Both the real and the\nimaginary parts of the rearrangement term are shown to be increasing functions of density,\nindicating that the effect of the ground state correlations is stronger at higher density.\nThe consideration of the two-hole line diagram of the mass operator reduces remarkably\nthe attraction of the lowest-order BHF s.p. potential and improves significantly the agreement of our microscopic s.p. potential with the empirical optical model potential [13]. For\nlow density up to about \u03c10 = 0.17 fm\u22123 , the total s.p. potential V12 (k) is shown to become\nmore attractive in the low-momentum region when the nuclear matter is heated up, which\ncan be attributed to the reduction of the repulsive contribution from the ground state correlations in the finite-temperature case. The role played by the TBF turns out to become\nstronger as the density increases. The TBF affects the total s.p. potential in two ways. On\nthe one hand it provides a repulsion to the BHF part and makes the BHF s.p. potential\nmore repulsive. On the other hand it suppresses somewhat the ground state correlations\nand reduces the repulsive contribution of the rearrangement term. As a combined result,\nat high densities the s.p. potential becomes less attractive in the whole momentum region\nwhen the TBF is taken into account. At high enough densities, the TBF contribution even\nchanges the temperature dependence of the s.p. potential, i.e., it makes the s.p. potential\nmore repulsive at high temperature than at low temperature.\nIn both cases with and without the TBF, the momentum dependence of the effective mass\ndisplays a broad peak around the Fermi momentum in the zero-temperature case, which is\nsimilar to the result obtained in the lowest BHF approximation. The effects of the TBF\nand the ground state correlations on the effective mass are found to be important mainly\n10\n\n\fbelow the Fermi surface. The ground state correlations make the peak more pronounced\nas compared to the BHF one, whereas the TBF reduces the peak via its effect on the\nrearrangement term. Increasing temperature smoothes the s.p. potential around the Fermi\nsurface and consequently leads to a flattening of the peak, making it almost vanish at high\nenough temperature. The value of the effective mass at the Fermi surface decreases with\ndensity, as in the BHF approximation.\nIn summary, it is shown by our investigation that both the ground state correlations and\nthe TBF affect considerably the s.p. potential in the nuclear medium and its temperature\ndependence. It is therefore important to take into account their effects in the application to\ntransport-model simulations of HIC.\nThis investigation reinforces the role played by TBF in nuclear matter. The G-matrix, as\ntwo-body effective interaction, which embodies the short-range particle-particle correlations,\nwhile preventing hard-core divergences, is not able to reproduce the empirical saturation\ndensity at the convergence of the hole line expansion [28]. Other non-relativistic approaches,\nthe variational method [24] as well as in-medium T-matrix theory seem to confirm the latter\nconclusion. On the other hand, it has been proven that the Dirac-Brueckner theory includes\nTBF (Z-diagrams) as the effect of coupling to the negative energy states.\nAcknowledgments\n\nThis work has been supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of\nChina (10575119,10235030), the Knowledge Innovation Project (KJCX2-SW-N02) of CAS,\nthe Major Program for Basic Research Development of China (G2000077400), the Major\nProphase Research Project of Fundamental Research of the Ministry of Science and Technology (2002CCB00200) of China, and by the Asia-Link project (CN/ASIA-LINK/008(94791))\nof the European Commission.\n\n[1] Nuclear Methods and the Nuclear Equation of State, Ed.

The results in the upper and lower\npanels are obtained by adopting the V18 and Nijmegen 93 two-body nucleon-nucleon interactions,\nrespectively. The solid (dashed) curves represent the results with (without) the TBF contribution\nfor temperatures T = 0, 10, 20 MeV from top to bottom.\n\nFIG. 3: The density dependence of the real and the imaginary parts of the rearrangement term\nat k = 0, M2 (k = 0), with (solid lines) and without (dashed lines) the TBF contribution for three\ndifferent temperatures T = 0, 10, 20 MeV from the top to bottom.\n\nFIG. 4: The real and imaginary parts of the total mass operator up to the second-order term\nfor four different nuclear densities as a function of momentum k. In each panel the rising curves\ncorrespond to the real part V12 (k) and the dropping curves to the imaginary part W12 (k). For both\nquantities, the solid and dashed (dotted and dot-dashed) lines stand for the results at T = 0, 20\nMeV with (without) the TBF contribution, as indicated in the first panel.\n\nFIG. 5: The effective mass m\u2217/m including the BHF and the second-order correlation contributions\nas a function of momentum k. The upper panel shows the results at normal nuclear matter density\nfor two temperatures T = 0, 20 MeV with and without the TBF. The lower panel depicts the\neffective mass including the TBF contribution at T = 0 for three densities \u03c1 = 0.085, 0.17, and\n0.34 fm\u22123 .\n\n14\n\n\fM(k)\n\n=\n\n+\n\n+\n\n+\n\n\u0001\u0001\u0001\n\n\fV2 (MeV)\nV2 (MeV)\n\nAV18\n\nAV18\n\nNIJ93\n\n1\n\n2\n\nwith TBF\nwithout TBF\n\nNIJ93\n\n3\n\nk (fm\u22121)\n\n4\n\n0.0\n\n0.4\n\n0.8\n\n1.2\n\nk (fm\u22121)\n\n1.6\n\n40\n35\n30\n25\n20\n15\n10\n5\n0\n40\n35\n30\n25\n20\n15\n10\n5\n0\n2.0\n\nW2 (MeV)\n\n28\n24\n20\n16\n12\n8\n4\n0\n0\n\nwith TBF\nwithout TBF\n\nW2 (MeV)\n\n28\n24\n20\n16\n12\n8\n4\n0\n\n\fV2 (MeV)\n\n44\n40\n36\n32\n28\n24\n20\n16\n12\n8\n4\n54\n\nNIJ93\n\nAV18\n\n48\n\nW2 (MeV)\n\nNIJ93\n\nAV18\n\n42\n36\n30\n24\n18\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n\u03c1 (fm\u22123)\n\n0.3\n\n0.4 0.1\n\n0.2\n\n\u03c1 (fm\u22123)\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n\fM12 (MeV)\n\n30\n\nAV18\n\nW12\n\n0\n-30\n-60\n-90\n\nT=0 with TBF\nT=0 without TBF\nT=20MeV with TBF\nT=20MeV without TBF\n\nV12\n\n\u03c1 = 0.255fm\n\n30\n\nM12 (MeV)\n\n\u22123\n\n\u03c1 =0.17 fm\n\n\u22123\n\n\u03c1 = 0.085 fm\n\n\u22123\n\n\u03c1 = 0.34fm\n\n\u22123\n\n0\n-30\n-60\n-90\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\u22121\n\nk (fm )\n\n4 0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\u22121\n\nk (fm )\n\n4\n\n\f\u22123\n\n\u03c1 = 0.17 fm\n\n1.2\n\nT=0\n\nm*/m\n\n1.0\n0.8\n\nT = 20 MeV\n\n0.6\n\nwithout TBF\nwith TBF\n\n0.4\n1.6\n\u22123\n\n1.4\n\n\u03c1=0.085 fm\n\n1.2\n\n\u03c1=0.17 fm\n\nm*/m\n\n\u22123\n\u22123\n\n\u03c1=0.34 fm\n\n1.0\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n1\n\n2\n\n\u22121\n\nk (fm )\n\n3\n\n\f"}
