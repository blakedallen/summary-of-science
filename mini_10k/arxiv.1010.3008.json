INTRODUCTION\n\nThe highly successful cold dark matter (CDM) model\nidealizes the thermal motions of dark matter particles\nas negligible on all scales at high redshift. In this\nmodel, perturbation modes on all scales are gravitationally unstable, leading to hierarchical structure formation in which nonlinear structures such as halos assemble through numerous mergers. Numerical simulations\nof structure formation within CDM models indicate that\nhalos are predicted to have steep central density profiles,\nwith logarithmic slopes d log \u03c1/d log r \u223c \u22121 on the smallest resolved scales (see Navarro et al. (2010) for a recent\nexample).\nIn many DM models, however, the DM temperature\nis nonzero, which can affect the properties of DM halos in multiple ways. For example, a finite DM temperature suppresses the abundance of low-mass halos.\nThis occurs because, following freezeout of dark matter\ninteractions, DM particles freely stream over some distance determined by their thermal velocities, and density\nfluctuations on scales below this free-streaming scale rfs\nare highly suppressed. Roughly speaking, the smallest\nhalos that arise are expected to have masses of order\n3\nMfs = (4\u03c0/3)\u03c1\u0304m rfs\n, although N-body simulations have\nnot definitively ruled out the formation of at least some\nhalos below Mfs through non-hierarchical processes like\nfragmentation (Wang & White 2007).\nBesides this suppression of the abundance of halos,\na nonzero DM temperature also can affect the central\ndensity profiles of the halos that do form. One elegant\nway to see this is to note that the DM phase space density is finite if the DM temperature is finite, and since\nDM is taken to be collisionless, then Liouville's theorem\nguarantees that the phase space density cannot increase.\nHence, the phase space density is bounded within DM\nhalos (Tremaine & Gunn 1979), which implies that the\ncentral slope of the DM density profile must vanish (e.g.\nTremaine et al. 1994). In other words, halos are expected\nto have central cores if the DM is not cold. Note that\nthis effect is caused by the finite DM temperature at the\ntime of formation of the halo, and is not due to the truncation of the small-scale linear power spectrum (Wang &\nWhite 2009).\nTherefore, increasing the DM temperature has the ef-\n\nfect of suppressing the number of low-mass halos, and\nof producing central cores in DM halos. Observationally, there may be evidence for both of these effects.\nThe observed number of Local Group satellite galaxies\nfalls well below the thousands of DM subhalos found in\nCDM simulations of halos like our Galaxy's (see Kravtsov\n(2010) for a recent review). In addition, the 21 cm rotation curves of certain galaxies, in particular low surface brightness (LSB) galaxies, appear better fit by cored\nDM profiles than cuspy DM profiles (see Kuzio de Naray\net al. (2010) for a recent discussion). For these reasons,\nthere has been considerable interest in the literature in\ninvestigating structure formation in models where DM\nis not perfectly cold. In so-called Warm Dark Matter\n(WDM) models, the DM temperature is chosen to make\nthe free-streaming scale correspond to subgalactic scales,\nrfs \u223c 0.1h\u22121 Mpc (Bode et al. 2001).\nWDM models have become increasingly disfavored in\nrecent years, in large part because of constraints on the\nmatter power spectrum derived from the Lyman-\u03b1 forest flux power spectrum (Seljak et al. 2006). The observational support for WDM models from dwarfs and\nLSB galaxies has also eroded, as faint Local Group satellites have been discovered in increasing numbers (e.g. Belokurov et al. 2007; Tollerud et al. 2008; Kravtsov 2010)\nthanks to the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. Recently, Kuzio\nde Naray et al. (2010) have argued that the large cores\napparently observed in certain LSB galaxies cannot all\nbe due to WDM, since the implied central phase space\ndensities in these systems are not universal, but instead\nshow large variations from object to object. This suggests an astrophysical origin for claimed detections of\ncentral cores, and mechanisms to produce such cores have\nbeen proposed (e.g. Governato et al. 2009).\nIn this paper, we present yet another argument against\nWDM as the origin of large cores in halo density profiles.\nAs discussed by Kuzio de Naray et al. (2010), the inferred\ncore radii in several LSB galaxies are large fractions of the\nhalo virial radii, rcore \u223c 5% r200 . As mentioned above,\nsuch large cores do not arise in CDM models, and so we\nmight naturally consider producing large cores by raising\nthe DM temperature. Making the DM warm, however,\nhas the side effect of wiping out small halos, and so it is\nnot obvious that raising the DM temperature can gener-\n\n\f2\n\nVillaescusa-Navarro & Dalal\n\nate halos with large rcore /r200 .\nWe can, however, use a simple argument to make an\norder-of-magnitude estimate of this ratio. Consider a\nWDM particle of mass m and typical momentum p. Following freezeout, its momentum redshifts as p \u221d a\u22121 ,\nso let us write p = mv0 /a, where v0 is the velocity today at z = 0 (since WDM must be nonrelativistic today, vp\nThe particle's velocity is then\n0 \u001c 1).\nv(a) = v0 / v02 + a2 (using units where c = 1). Neglecting accelerations caused by gravitational potential\nfluctuations, the particle freely streams a comoving distance\n\u0013\n\u0012\nZ\nv dt\nv0\naeq\nrfs =\n\u223c 1/2\n,\n(1)\nlog\na\nv0\n\u03a9r H0\nwhere we assume v0 \u001c aeq = \u03a9r /\u03a9m . This distance\n3\nencloses mass Mfs = (4\u03c0/3)\u03c1\u0304m rfs\n, and as noted above,\nthe smallest halos that form will have masses of order\nMfs . The virial velocities of these halos at their formation\nepoch ac are\n!\n\u0012\n\u00131/2\n1/3 1/2\nGMfs\n\u03a9m \u2206200\nv200 =\n=\nH0 rfs , (2)\nr200\n2ac\nwhere \u2206200 \u2248 200 is the virial overdensity. Now, because\nthe thermal velocity vth \u2248 v0 /ac at expansion factor ac is\nnonzero, infalling particles will not fall directly towards\nthe halo center, but instead have a nonzero impact parameter, and the typical impact parameter determines\nthe core size. Naively, we might expect that at formation (a = ac ),\n!1/2\n\u0012\n\u0013\nrcore\nvth\n2\naeq\n\u03a9r\n\u223c\n\u223c\n/ log\n.\n(3)\nr200\nv200\n\u03a9m \u22061/3 ac\nv0\n200\n\nFollowing formation, any subsequent growth in halo mass\ncan only decrease the core radius, while the virial radius\ncan only increase. Indeed, even if the mass distribution\naround the halo is static, with no accretion following formation, the virial radius will still grow in time proportionally to the expansion factor a, because the expansion\nof the universe dilutes the background mean matter density. This is the reason why halo concentrations correlate with halo formation times in CDM cosmologies (e.g.\nWechsler et al. 2002; Zhao et al. 2003a,b). Therefore, following the formation epoch ac , the ratio rcore /rvir must\ndiminish in time at least as fast as ac /a; any mass accretion will only decrease this ratio even faster. Assuming\nno growth, then at the present time (a = 1)\n!1/2\n\u0012\n\u00131/2\n\u0012\n\u0013\nrcore\n\u03a9r\n2ac\naeq\n\u223c\n/\nlog\n. (4)\n1/3\nr200\n\u03a9m\nv0\n\u2206\n200\n\nThis ratio is maximized by delaying halo formation as\nlate as possible. For typical parameters, and setting ac =\n1, this gives rcore \u2248 10\u22123 r200 observed today.\nFrom this simple order-of-magnitude estimate, it appears unlikely that WDM models can produce sufficiently\nlarge core radii to explain LSB galaxies. This argument is only approximate, however. To make further\nprogress, we have performed calculations of halo formation in WDM models. Our results indicate that WDM\n\nhalo cores are broadly consistent with (though typically\nsmaller than) the above estimate, which precludes WDM\nas an explanation for the large cores that are claimed to\nexist in certain LSB galaxies.\n2. NUMERICAL METHOD\n\nIn this section we describe our numerical method to\nsolve for the self-consistent halo density profile following\ncollapse. We eschew conventional N-body simulations,\nsince for feasible simulation parameters the core radii will\ntypically be unresolved or (at best) marginally resolved\n(Col\u0131\u0301n et al. 2008). Since we are interested in studying\nthe behavior on scales smaller than the typical resolution limits of conventional N-body simulations, we have\ninstead employed an alternative approach similar to that\nused by Lithwick & Dalal (2010).\nWe calculate the collapse of isolated peaks in an expanding universe. To isolate the effects of the nonzero\nWDM temperature during halo collapse, we focus on the\ncase of spherical collapse. This problem has been investigated previously in the literature, and it is straightforward to show that cold, spherical collapse gives halos\nwith central density profiles behaving as \u03c1 \u221d r\u22122 , or\nsteeper (Fillmore & Goldreich 1984; Bertschinger 1985;\nLithwick & Dalal 2010). Because cold spherical collapse\nis well-understood, any departures from r\u22122 profiles are\nclearly due to the effects of warm collapse. By Newton's\ntheorem, our calculations neglect the effects of the local\nenvironment of peaks, which cause peaks to collapse nonspherically. We know from previous cosmological WDM\nsimulations, however, that accounting for the effects of\nlocal environment does not lead to large cores in WDM\nhalos (Col\u0131\u0301n et al. 2008; Wang & White 2009).\nFor a given potential \u03a6(r, t), assumed to be spherically symmetric, we integrate the equations of motion\nto solve for the orbit R(t) for each particle. Given the\norbit R(t), we compute the mass profile deposited by\neach particle. We compute orbits for many particles,\nand sum over all their deposited mass profiles to obtain\nthe total mass profile Mtotal (r, t), and the total density\n\u03c1 = (dMtotal /dr)/(4\u03c0r2 ). Then, we repeat this procedure, using the newly obtained mass profile, and iterate\nto convergence.\nWe initialize this procedure using linear perturbation\ntheory. We start with a linear density profile \u03b4(rL ) describing the initial peak at the starting epoch ainit =\n(1 + zinit )\u22121 . Here, rL is a comoving Lagrangian radius,\nto be distinguished from the proper Eulerian radius r at\nsubsequent times. We choose the initial peak profile to\nbe proportional to the (linear theory) matter correlation\nfunction, \u03b4(rL ) \u221d \u03be(rL ). This corresponds to the average\nprofile of high peaks in the \u03bd \u2192 \u221e limit (Bardeen et al.\n1986), and so this profile should be typical of the first\nhalos to form in WDM cosmologies. The matter correlation function depends on the WDM transfer function,\nwhich Bode et al. (2001) found to be well described by\nthe parametrization\nTWDM (k) = [1 + (\u03b1k)2\u03bd ]\u22125/\u03bd ,\n\n(5)\n\nwhere \u03bd \u2248 1.2 and \u03b1 is a characteristic length scale. We\nparametrize WDM models by their free-streaming scale\nrfs , or equivalently the enclosed mass Mfs , so we require a\ntranslation between rfs and \u03b1. We determine the equiv-\n\n\fCores and Cusps in WDM Halos\n\nfor smoothing scale R, which we take to be equal to rfs .\nWe have found that \u03b1 \u2248 5rfs provides a reasonable match\nto the two functions.\nGiven a desired free-streaming mass Mfs and halo formation redshift zform , we set the initial peak profile shape\n\u03b4(r = ainit rL ) to be proportional to the correlation function (using the appropriate rfs ), and normalize the peak\nheight at the starting redshift\nR r so that the average interior overdensity \u03b4\u0304 \u2261 3r\u22123 0 r2 \u03b4 dr, linearly evolved to\nredshift zform and evaluated at the free-streaming scale\nis \u03b4\u0304(rL = rfs , z = zform ) = \u03b4c = 1.686, in accordance\nwith the spherical collapse model (Gunn & Gott 1972).\nWe assume that this linear profile evolves at early times\naccording to linear perturbation theory:\n\u03b4(r = a rL , a) = D(a)\u03b4(rL )\n\n(7)\n\nwhere D(a) is the linear growth factor, which for \u039bCDM\nuniverses with no pressure perturbations may be expressed as\nZ a\nda\nD(a) \u221d H(a)\n,\n(8)\n3\n(aH)\n0\nnormalized so that D(a = 1) = 1 (Peebles 1980).\nNote that this procedure is not entirely self-consistent,\nsince our use of CDM growth factors neglects the scaledependence in WDM growth factors caused by residual\nfree-streaming at late times. Our neglect of this residual\nfree streaming when normalizing the initial peak height\nmeans that our peaks do not actually reach \u03b4 = \u03b4c at\nredshift zform , leading to slight errors in the formation\nepoch. This does not appear to affect our results significantly.\nThis procedure specifies the initial overdensity perturbation at the starting redshift of the simulation. We also\nrequire the initial velocities for all the particles. These\nvelocities have three contributions: the Hubble velocity,\nthe bulk peculiar velocity, and a random thermal velocity. The Hubble term is of course just given by vH = H r.\nThe bulk peculiar velocity may be computed from the\ndensity profile, using the linearized continuity equation\n\u03b4\u0307 + \u2207 * v = 0,\n\n(9)\n\nalong with the assumption of potential flow at early times\n(i.e. \u2207 \u00d7 v = 0).

We sample 6000\ninitial radii spaced uniformly in volume, up to a maximum radius chosen to enclose the virialized region at\nz = 0. For each radius, we sample the momentum distribution with 500 points and the angular distribution\nwith 200 points, weighting the particles according to the\nfraction of initial volume, solid angle, and momentum\ndistribution that they represent.\nGiven the initial conditions for each particle, we then\nintegrate forward the equations of motion using a fourth\norder, variable timestep Runge-Kutta integrator. The\nequations of motion are given by the usual Newtonian\ndynamics:\nd2 R\nL2\n\u2212\n= \u2212\u2207\u03a6,\n(13)\ndt2\nR3\nwhere the angular momentum L = R \u00d7 v is conserved\nbecause of the assumed spherical symmetry.\nGiven an orbit R(t), the enclosed mass profile deposited by each particle is\nM (r, t) = mp \u0398[r \u2212 R(t)],\n\n(14)\n\nwhere mp is the mass represented by the particle, and\n\u0398(x) is the step function. Summing over all particles\ngives the total mass profile Mtotal (r, t), and the density\n\u03c1(r, t) and potential \u03a6(r, t) follow easily. Having computed the mass profile M (r, t) for a given iteration, we\nthen use that mass profile in the equations of motion for\nthe subsequent iteration. In practice, we bin the mass\nprofile using a grid with 350 bins spaced uniformly in\nexpansion factor a and 500 logarithmically spaced bins\nin radius, and then linearly interpolate from this grid\nto estimate the mass M at arbitrary times and radii as\nneeded for the orbit integrations.\nTo expedite this calculation, we have made use of a\nsimplifying approximation. For particles deep within the\nhalo, whose orbital times are small compared to the Hubble time, we stop the orbital integration after the fractional change in the product Rapo \u00d7 M (Rapo ) over one\norbit is less than 10\u22123 . Thereafter, we assume that the\norbit evolves adiabatically.\nSpecifically, we assume that\nH\nthe radial action Jr = vr dR \u221d [Rapo M (Rapo )]1/2 is an\nadiabatic invariant.

The halo density\nprofile at z = 2.7 after iterations 1,2,3,6 and 7 are shown in the\ncolored curves, while the black curve shows the converged profile\n(12 iterations).\n\nprofile M (r, t), we then easily determine the time evolution of the orbital apoapse Rapo . As Fig. 1 illustrates,\nadiabaticity is an excellent approximation for these orbits. Similarly, we assume that the ratio of periapse to\napoapse, Rperi /Rapo , is also conserved because of conservation of angular momentum. Given Rperi and Rapo ,\nwe then assume that the mass profile deposited by this\nparticle is\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\nif r > Rapo\n\uf8f21,\nr\u2212Rperi\n,\nif Rperi < r < Rapo (15)\nM (r, t) = mp \u00d7 Rapo \u2212R\nperi\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f30,\nif r < Rperi\nwhich is a good approximation to Eqn. (14), except for\nradii very near Rperi or Rapo .\nThis iterative procedure rapidly converges to a selfconsistent collapse solution; Figure 2 illustrates one typical example. As the figure shows, the interior density\nprofile quickly settles into roughly r\u22122 behavior, as expected, although there are features at both large radii\nand small radii. The spikes at large radii are caustics,\na well-known feature of cold spherical collapse (Fillmore\n& Goldreich 1984; Vogelsberger et al. 2009). At small\nradii, discreteness effects of the finite number of particles\nleads to noise in the determined profile. This noise in the\nmass profile enters the equations of motion for particles,\nwhich affects particle orbits and leads to rapidly developing instabilities in the phase-space structure (H\u00e9non\n1973; Barnes et al. 1986; Henriksen & Widrow 1997).\nThese instabilities significantly distort the shape of the\nradial caustics at times following collapse. We have\nchecked that if we suppress these instabilities by artificially smoothing the potential, the caustics match the\nexpected form. Because these instabilities are physical, rather than numerical in origin, we have opted not\nto suppress them. Accordingly, our density profiles at\nlate times, long after collapse, do not show the expected\nprominent caustics.\n\n8\n\n\" [pc/Gyr]\n\n2\n\n10\n10\nr [pc]\n\n10\n\n107\n6\n\n10\n\n105\n104\n10-11\n\n3\n\n1\n\n10\n\n3\n\n0\n\n10\n\n!/\" [MsunGyr ]\n\n100\n\n109\n8\n10\n107\n6\n10\n5\n10\n104\n103\n102\n1\n10\n\n10-12\n10-13\n10-14\n10-15\n10-16\n10-17\n10-18 -1\n\n10\n\n0\n\n10\n\n1\n\n10\n\n2\n\n10\nr [pc]\n\n10\n\n3\n\n4\n\n10\n\n5\n\n10\n\nFig. 3.- Collapsed profile as a function of time.

RESULTS\n\nIn this section we present results of our calculations.\nIn the first subsection, we illustrate the behavior found\nin one typical simulation, and in the following subsection\n\n3.1. Anatomy of a WDM halo\n\nIn this subsection, we describe the detailed results of\none of our simulations. The behavior found for this halo\n\n\f\u03c1c\n\u03c1= h\n\u0010\n\u0011\u03b1 i2/\u03b1 .\nr\n1 + rcore\n\n(16)\n\nThe parameter \u03b1 controls how sharply the profile breaks\nfrom r\u22122 behavior to constant density, and typically our\n\nr200 [pc]\nrcore/r200\n\nis representative of our simulations. For concreteness, we\nuse a WDM temperature T0 /m = 1.3*10\u22128 in units where\nc = 1, which gives a free-streaming scale rfs \u223c 100 h\u22121\nkpc, and normalize the initial peak amplitude so that\nhalo formation occurs near redshift z = 3. Figures 3\nand 4 show the results. Figure 3 plots the density profile\n\u03c1(r), the 3-D velocity dispersion \u03c3(r), and the pseudophase-space density \u03c1/\u03c3 3 , as a function of time, while\nFig. 4 illustrates a snapshot in time of the radial dynamics. At early times, prior to collapse, the density\nevolves perturbatively, so that the \u03c1(r) profile is similar\nto the original linear density perturbation \u03b4(r), simply\ngrowing in amplitude. The phase-space density remains\nvery homogeneous before collapse. Near the time of collapse, there is smooth infall towards the halo, and both\nthe density and velocity dispersion rise in concert to keep\n\u03c1/\u03c3 3 nearly constant. Orbits do cross in the infall region,\nhowever, since particles with different thermal velocities\nfall into the collapsing halo at different rates.\nThe initial collapse of the halo produces a roughly r\u22122\ndensity profile, due to our assumption of spherical symmetry. This breaks to a shallower \u03c1 \u223c const behavior at\nthe core radius rcore , where the infalling particles reach\nperiapse. Following periapse, the particles splash back\noutwards with positive radial velocity. The splash-back\nsurface defines the outermost caustic, where both the\ndensity and velocity dispersion jump precipitously. The\ndensity jumps at the caustic due to a pile-up of particles\nwith similar apoapses. The velocity dispersion jumps because outside the caustic, particles are all falling inwards,\nwhereas inside the caustic there is both outwards and inwards motion. Inside the caustic, the velocity dispersion\nremains roughly isothermal, at a value near the halo's\nvirial velocity.\nBecause \u03c1 \u223c r\u22122 and \u03c3 is nearly constant with radius,\nthe pseudo-phase space density shows a nearly powerlaw behavior over much of the virialized region. Outside\nthe outermost caustic, \u03c1/\u03c3 3 remains nearly identical to\nthe phase space density of the unperturbed material. At\nthe caustic, \u03c1/\u03c3 3 falls steeply, due to the sudden increase\nin velocity dispersion. Towards smaller radii, \u03c1/\u03c3 3 rises\nsmoothly, close to r\u22122 . It is important to stress, however,\nthat \u03c1/\u03c3 3 is not a good proxy for the actual phase-space\ndensity over much of the halo's interior. The velocity\ndispersion tensor is highly anisotropic, in the sense that\nradial velocities are much larger than tangential velocities, as can be seen from the predominantly radial orbits\nshown in Figures 1 and 4. For this reason, \u03c3 \u2248 \u03c3r , and\nso \u03c3 3 \u2248 \u03c3r3 \u001d \u03c3r \u03c3\u03b8 \u03c3\u03c6 . Only near the core radius does\nthe velocity dispersion become close to isotropic.\nMany of these features are similar to what is found\nin cold spherical collapse (Fillmore & Goldreich 1984;\nBertschinger 1985). The most obvious difference between\nwarm and cold collapse is the presence of a core radius,\ncaused by the orbits' inability to reach r = 0 due to their\nnonzero angular momenta. We estimate the core radius\nby fitting the density profile to the functional form\n\nrcore [pc]\n\nCores and Cusps in WDM Halos\n\n5\n\n5\n4\n3\n105\n104\n10-3\n10-4\n10-5\n\n2.5\n\n2\n\n1.5\n\nZ\n\n1\n\n0.5\n\n0\n\nFig. 5.- Time dependence of halo properties. The upper, middle\nand lower panels show rcore , r200 , and the ratio rcore /r200 respectively, as a function of redshift. As the halo grows in mass over\ntime, the virial radius grows, while the core radius shrinks due to\nadiabatic contraction. The ratio rcore /r200 is therefore maximized\nat the time of halo formation, and only diminishes thereafter.\n\nsimulations give \u03b1 \u2248 1 \u2212 2. We are mainly interested,\nhowever in the core radius. As Figure 4 shows, rcore coincides with the typical location of the periapse of the\ninfalling particles. Both the density and pseudo-phase\nspace density plateau at rcore , the latter saturating at a\nvalue near the phase space density of unvirialized material outside the halo as expected from the Tremaine &\nGunn (1979) bound.\nFigure 5 illustrates the evolution of the halo structural\nparameters over time. Following formation, the halo continues to accrete matter and steadily grows in mass, at a\nrate determined by the initial linear overdensity profile.\nBy definition, this growth in M200 means that r200 grows\nas well. Note, however, that rcore decreases as the halo\ngrows, due to adiabatic contraction of the orbits as the\nhalo potential deepens over time. Since rcore only shrinks\nin time, while r200 grows in time, the ratio between the\ntwo is clearly maximized at the time of formation of the\nhalo.\nLastly, in Figure 6 we plot the breakdown of the contributions to the mass profile from various radii. The\nleft panel decomposes the particles into shells of initial\nradius at z = 100, while the middle panel uses bins of\nturnaround radius rta . At large radii, r \u001d rcore , the\nmass is dominated by recently infalling particles that\noriginated at large Lagrangian radius and have large\nturnaround radii, similar to the behavior found in cold\nspherical collapse (Fillmore & Goldreich 1984). However,\nthis changes on scales of order the core radius. Near\nrcore , many different shells spanning decades in radius\ncontribute comparably to the density. When we bin the\nparticles based on initial, Lagrangian radius, we can see\nthat each shell has a different core radius, roughly scaling\nas rcore \u221d rL , as may be expected from the arguments\ngiven in the introduction. When we bin the particles\nbased on their turnaround radii, we can see that the typical apoapse for each shell scales like the turnaround radius. For shells with rapo > rcore , the enclosed mass\nprofile behaves as\n(\n1\nr \u001d rcore\nr\nMshell (r) \u221d rL3 \u00d7\n\u00d7 \u0010 r \u00112\n(17)\nrapo\nr \u001c rcore\nrcore\n\n\f6\n\nVillaescusa-Navarro & Dalal\n109\n\n109\n\n101\n\n8\n\n8\n\n100\n\n7\n\n10-1\n\n10\n\n10\n\n7\n\n10\n\n6\n\n6\n\n10\n! / \u2013!\n\n! / \u2013!\n\n10\n\n105\n104\n\n105\n104\n\ntotal\n[32,64] pc\n\n103\n\ntotal\n[5,25] pc\n\n103\n\n[64,128] pc\n\n101 -1\n10\n\n100\n\n101\nr [pc]\n\n102\n\n103\n\n10-3\n10-4\n10\n\n[125,625] pc\n\n102\n\n[256,512] pc\n[512,1024] pc\n\n10-2\n\n[25,125] pc\n\n[128,256] pc\n\n102\n\ndP/d(log r)\n\n10\n\n-5\n\n[625,3125] pc\n[3125,15625] pc\n\n101 -1\n10\n\n100\n\n101\nr [pc]\n\n102\n\n103\n\n10-6 0\n10\n\n101\n\n102\n\n103\n\n104\n\nr [pc]\n\nFig. 6.- Breakdown of the mass distribution. The left panel shows the contribution to the mass density \u03c1(r) at z = 2.6 originating\nfrom shells at various initial radii at z = 100. The middle panel shows a similar breakdown, instead binning particles based on their radii\nat turnaround. The right panel shows the distribution of initial radii (blue dashed) and turnaround radii (red solid) for all particles with\nr < rcore at z = 2.6.\n\nand since rcore \u221d rL for each shell, we see that inside\nthe core radius, the mass profile deposited by each shell\nof width d log rL scales as Mshell \u221d r3 \u00d7 (rL /rapo ) \u221d\nr3 \u00d7 (rL /rta ). (For shells with rapo < rcore , the enclosed mass simply behaves as Mshell (r) \u221d (rL r/rcore )3 ,\nof course.) For cold collapse, there is a one-to-one relationship between the turnaround radius rta and the\ninitial radius, that depends on the initial linear density\nprofile of the peak collapsing to form the halo. Roughly\nspeaking, if locally the linear density has slope \u03b3, in\nthe sense that \u03b4 \u221d rL\u2212\u03b3 , then rta \u221d rL1+\u03b3 (Lithwick &\nDalal 2010). The tight relationship between rL and rta\ndegrades somewhat for warm collapse, but we can still\nuse the same basic scaling. For shells inside the freestreaming scale, rL < rfs , the peak profile is quite flat\nwith local slope \u03b3 \u2248 0, and so rta \u221d rL . For these shells,\nMshell (r) becomes roughly independent of the shell's initial radius for r < rcore , as is seen in Fig. 6. For larger\nradii, rL & rfs , the slope of the initial profile becomes\nnonzero, \u03b3 > 0, implying that shells originating from\nlarge radius become subdominant inside the core radius.\nThus, the mass inside the core radius is dominated by\nshells with rL . rfs and rapo > rcore , and receives roughly\nequal contributions per decade within this range, as is\nseen in the right panel of Figure 6.\n3.2. Dependence on physical parameters\n\nHaving established the basic features of the halo structure, we now explore the physics that sets those properties. The two main differences between WDM and CDM\nare the cutoff in the power spectrum, and the relic thermal velocities of DM particles at the time of halo formation. Both of these differences influence the size of halo\ncore radii. To disentangle the different effects, we have\nperformed collapse simulations in which we hold fixed\nthe linear density profile of the initial peak, but vary the\nWDM temperature. This corresponds to holding fixed\nthe halo assembly history, but varying the random motions near the time of collapse. The argument given in\nsection 1 (e.g., Eqn. (3)) would predict that rcore would\nscale linearly with temperature, and our calculations appear consistent with this, as shown in Fig. 7. As we vary\nthe temperature, the overall assembly history and structure of the halo remains unchanged (e.g., the location and\nheight of the caustics), however the core radius varies.\nWe find that a simple linear scaling, rcore \u221d T , appears\nconsistent with our simulations. We note, however, that\nthis linear behavior breaks down at very high temper-\n\natures, when the particles' random velocities become of\norder the Hubble velocity at the time of halo collapse. In\nthis regime, the thermal motions are no longer a small\nperturbation to the particle dynamics, and the overall\ncollapse of the halo is significantly modified, unsurprisingly. Of course, such calculations are not self-consistent:\nthe large random motions that modify halo collapse at\nlow redshift would have erased the initial linear density\nperturbations responsible for the halo, at a higher redshift.\nThis establishes that at fixed initial peak profile (i.e.\nfixed halo assembly history), the core radius scales linearly with DM temperature. It is inconsistent, however,\nto hold fixed the initial peak profile while the temperature is varied, since the random thermal motions of DM\nparticles erase structure at high redshift and modify the\npeak profiles in the linear regime of structure formation.\nTherefore, we next explore how the core radius behaves\nas we self-consistently vary both the WDM temperature\nand the initial peak profile. We know that rfs scales\nroughly linearly with T , and we have just seen that at\nfixed rfs , the core radius rcore also scales linearly with T .\nTherefore, if rcore were independent of the halo assembly\nrate, then both rcore and rfs would scale linearly with\nT , and the ratio rcore /r200 would be independent of the\nWDM temperature, as we argued in Section 1. Figure\n8 shows that this behavior is not confirmed by our simulations, however. The figure shows the results of simulations using temperatures 5 times larger, and smaller,\nthan our fiducial calculation. The red solid curve shows\nthe density profile for rfs = 20 h\u22121 kpc, orange dashed\nshows our fiducial run with rfs = 100 h\u22121 kpc, and blue\ndotted shows results for rfs = 500 h\u22121 kpc. In all three\ncases, we set the initial peak height so that collapse will\noccur near z = 3. As expected, r200 scales close to linearly with rfs : the three simulations give r200 = 1.2, 5.5,\nand 22.6 kpc at the formation redshift z = 2.7. However,\nrcore does not scale linearly with rfs : the three simulations give rcore =0.6, 4.8 and 43 pc respectively. The ratio\nrcore /r200 is not independent of rfs , but instead behaves\n1/2\nroughly as rfs over the range that we have considered.\nEvidently, the core radius depends not only on the DM\ntemperature at the time of halo formation, but also upon\nthe halo assembly rate.\nLastly, we examine the dependence of the core radius\non the halo formation time. We do so, simply by adjusting the height of the initial peak, holding fixed the\nWDM temperature and the radial shape of the peak pro-\n\n\fCores and Cusps in WDM Halos\n\n7\n\n6\nT=0.1T0\n\n10\n\n10\n\nT=0.3T0\n\n5\n\nT=0.6T0\nT=T0\n\n8\n\nrcore [pc]\n\n! / \u2013!\n\n10\n\n6\n\n10\n\n104\n2\n\n10\n\n4\n3\n2\n1\n\n0\n\n10 -5\n10\n\n10-4\n\n10-3\n\n10-2\n10-1\nr / r200\n\n100\n\n101\n\n102\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\nT / T0\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\nFig. 7.- Temperature dependence of the halo profile for a fixed initial peak profile.

Figure 9 shows one example, comparing our fiducial\nsimulation (with zform = 2.7) with a run using the same\nWDM temperature, but with initial peak height a factor of 4 larger. The later simulation has zform = 13.6.\nThe halo masses of the two simulations are similar, as\nexpected: r200 = 1.3 kpc for the z = 13.6 halo, compared to r200 = 5.5 kpc for the fiducial z = 2.7 halo.\nThe core radius for the earlier-forming halo is rcore =2.8\npc, compared to 4.8 pc for the fiducial halo, so that the\nratio rcore /r200 changes by a factor of 2.8. The simple argument given in section 1 would have predicted\nthat rcore /r200 would scale as (1 + zform )1/2 , whereas\nour simulation appears more consistent with a scaling\nrcore /r200 \u221d (1 + zform )2/3 . This is only based on one\ncomparison, of course. This is the result at the formation time; at z = 0 the ratio rcore /r200 would be smaller\nby at least a factor of 1/(1 + zform ), as we argued earlier.\n4. DISCUSSION AND SUMMARY\n\nWe have investigated the formation of halos in warm\ndark matter cosmologies. Our study of spherical collapse\nof WDM halos indicates that core radii do indeed arise in\nthese cosmologies, as expected from simple phase-space\narguments (Tremaine & Gunn 1979). However, we find\nthat WDM core radii are generically small, typically of\n\n100\n\n10-4\n\n10-3\n\n10-2\n\n10-1\nr / r200\n\n100\n\n101\n\n102\n\nFig. 9.- Effect of initial peak height. The solid black line shows\nthe profile at collapse time z = 2.7 for a peak height normalization of \u03b4\u0304(rL = 100 h\u22121 kpc, z = 3) = 1.686. In contrast, dashed\nblue shows the profile at collapse time z = 13.6 for a peak height\nnormalization of \u03b4\u0304(rL = 100 h\u22121 kpc, z = 15) = 1.686.\n\norder 10\u22123 of the halo virial radius at the time of formation, and considerably smaller following formation. This\nis for halos forming at the cutoff scale; higher mass halos will have substantially smaller rcore /r200 . We have\ninvestigated the dependence of the core radius on various physical parameters such as the WDM temperature,\nhalo formation redshift, and halo mass. For the allowed\nrange of WDM temperatures (e.g. Mfs . 109 M ), the\ncore radii of halos observed at z = 0 are generically expected to be far smaller than the core sizes measured in\ncertain LSB galaxies, with rcore /r200 \u2248 0.05.\nOur calculations have all assumed spherical symmetry, whereas halo formation in both CDM and WDM\ncosmologies is highly nonspherical. We would argue,\nhowever, that our conclusions regarding WDM cores are\nlikely to be valid for non-spherical collapse as well. One\nline of evidence supporting this argument is the fact that\nthe pseudo-phase-space density profiles of our halos are\nquite similar to the profiles of halos in CDM simulations,\nwith \u03c1/\u03c3 3 \u221d r\u22122 , roughly speaking (Ludlow et al. 2010).\nThis similarity is presumably a consequence of the virial\ntheorem, which ensures that \u03c1/\u03c3 2 \u223c r\u22122 . For WDM\nhalos, the power-law rise of the pseudo-phase-space density towards small r saturates when \u03c1/\u03c3 3 approaches the\n\n\f8\n\nVillaescusa-Navarro & Dalal\n\nTremaine-Gunn bound, and this saturation will occur\nfor both spherical and nonspherical collapse. Now, we\nwould expect the value of the pseudo-phase-space density to be similar at the virial radius for both spherical\nand non-spherical collapse, since the halo mass and virial\nradius are by definition the same in the two cases, and so\n\u03c1 \u223c M/4\u03c0r3 and \u03c3 \u223c (GM200 /r200 )1/2 will be similar for\nthe two cases. We have noted that \u03c1/\u03c3 3 rises as roughly\nr\u22122 inside the virial radius in spherical and nonspherical collapse, and in both cases the core radius occurs\nwhere \u03c1/\u03c3 3 approaches the Tremaine-Gunn bound. So\nwe have good reason to believe that halo core radii will\nnot be significantly larger for nonspherical collapse than\nfor spherical collapse, just because the \u03c1/\u03c3 3 profiles appear similar.\nThe other possible loophole in our argument is that we\nhave assumed that no halos form below the cutoff scale\nin the power spectrum. N-body simulations have not\n\nyet conclusively determined whether or not halos with\nM \u001c Mfs arise in WDM cosmologies, due to numerical\ndifficulties associated with simulating truncated power\nspectra (Wang & White 2007). We have begun investigating this issue, and our preliminary results indicate\nthat halos may form below the cutoff scale, though it is\nunclear whether they can form in sufficient numbers to\naccount for observed LSB galaxies.\nOur results indicate that warm dark matter cosmologies cannot produce halos with core radii large enough to\naccount for the density profiles of observed LSB galaxies.\nThis would suggest that the origin of these observed cores\nlies within astrophysics, rather than particle physics.\nWe thank Manoj Kaplinghat, Mark Vogelsberger and\nLarry Widrow for useful discussions.
