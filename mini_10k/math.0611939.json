We prove that Fefferman spaces, associated to non\u2013degenerate CR structures of hypersurface type, are characterised, up to local\nconformal isometry, by the existence of a parallel orthogonal complex\nstructure on the standard tractor bundle. This condition can be equivalently expressed in terms of conformal holonomy. Extracting from this\npicture the essential consequences at the level of tensor bundles yields an\nimproved, conformally invariant analogue of Sparling's characterisation\nof Fefferman spaces.\n\n1. Introduction\nFefferman spaces provide a geometric relationship between CR geometry\nand conformal geometry; given a CR manifold M , of hypersurface type, one\nobtains a canonical conformal structure on the total space M\u0303 of a certain\ncircle bundle over M . The first version of this construction in [13] applied\nto the boundaries of strictly pseudoconvex domains, and used Fefferman's\nambient metric construction. Soon after that, a version for abstract non\u2013\ndegenerate CR structures of hypersurface type was given in [3]. This used\nthe canonical Cartan connection for CR structures of Chern and Moser [12].\nRecently there has been renewed interest in the Cartan connection approach to CR structures and, more generally, parabolic geometries. Several\npowerful tools, like tractor calculus and BGG sequences for these geometries\nhave been developed. These tools provide a new and effective approach the\nconstruction of Fefferman spaces and to treating the complicated relationship between the natural objects on the Fefferman space with those on the\nunderlying CR manifold. This approach has been taken up in the article\n[9], where several new results on Fefferman spaces their conformal geometry are obtained. Central in these developments is the result that on the\n(conformal) standard tractor bundle of a Fefferman space M\u0303 , one obtains\na parallel orthogonal complex structure. This complex structure makes the\nstandard tractor bundle into a Hermitian vector bundle and the standard\ntractor connection into a Hermitian connection. Key to the power of this\napproach is that these data are rather simply related to the CR standard\ntractor bundle of M .\nIn this article we complete the picture by showing that Fefferman spaces\nare in fact characterised by this orthogonal parallel complex structure, up\nDate: November 30, 2006.\n1991 Mathematics Subject Classification. primary: 53C29, 53C25, 53A40; secondary:\n32V05.\nKey words and phrases.

This has a very nice interpretation in terms of\nconformal holonomy, an area of significant recent interest, see e.g. [1] and\nreferences therein. By definition, conformal holonomy is the holonomy group\nof the standard tractor connection. In the dimensions and signatures which\nare relevant for us, this is a subgroup of SO(2p\u2032 + 2, 2q \u2032 + 2). Existence of\na parallel orthogonal complex structure is clearly equivalent to the conformal holonomy being contained in the subgroup U (p\u2032 + 1, q \u2032 + 1). Hence\nwe obtain a characterisation of Fefferman spaces among general conformal structures analogous to the characterisation of K\u00e4hler manifolds among\npseudo-Riemannian manifolds. By construction, the conformal holonomy of\na Fefferman space is in fact automatically contained in the smaller subgroup\nSU (p\u2032 + 1, q \u2032 + 1). As a corollary, we therefore obtain that if the conformal\nholonomy is contained in U (p\u2032 + 1, q \u2032 + 1) then the holonomy Lie algebra\nalready has to be contained in su(p\u2032 + 1, q \u2032 + 1). In particular, u(p\u2032 + 1, q \u2032 + 1)\ncannot be a conformal holonomy Lie algebra although it is a Berger algebra.\nIn fact this follows easily and directly from a simple calculation using the\ntractor connection, see Proposition 2.1. This was proved in a more involved\nway in [16].\nThere is a characterisation of Fefferman spaces available in the literature,\nwhich is usually referred to as Sparling's characterisation. While Sparling's\noriginal work remained unpublished, the characterisation has been proved\nin a different way by C.R. Graham in [15]. The central ingredient for this\ncharacterisation is an isotropic Killing field with certain additional properties. In our picture, this arises as follows: A parallel orthogonal complex\nstructure J on the standard tractor bundle can be interpreted as a parallel\nsection of the adjoint tractor bundle. Any section of the adjoint tractor\nbundle has an underlying vector field, and for a parallel section this is automatically a conformal Killing field which inserts trivially into the Cartan\ncurvature. Expanding the condition J \u25e6 J = \u2212 id yields the remaining properties required in Sparling's characterisation (and other identities that are\ndifferential consequences of these).\nIn the last section of the article we that show that the tensorial consequences of J \u25e6 J = \u2212 id lead to a characterisation of Fefferman spaces that\nis in the same spirit as Sparling's, but is conformally invariant. Using this,\nwith the extra choice of a certain conformal scale, recovers Sparling's characterisation precisely. This provides additional insight into the structure of\nconformal manifolds which admit isotropic conformal Killing fields.\nWe assume that the reader is familiar with basic conformal geometry and\nconformal tractor calculus and we will follow the conventions of [14]. Other\nsources for background on conformal tractor calculus are [2] and [8], for generalisations to parabolic geometries see [7]. All facts about the construction\nof Fefferman spaces we need can be found in [9].\nAcknowledgement.

A characterisation of Fefferman spaces\n2.1. Parallel adjoint tractors and conformal Killing fields. The main\ntechnical input for the characterisation is provided by general results in\nconformal geometry. Hence we start in the general setting of a smooth\nmanifold M of dimension n \u2265 3 endowed with a conformal structure [g] of\nsignature (p, q). Then the standard tractor bundle (see [2, 8]) is a vector\nbundle T \u2192 M of rank n + 2, endowed with a bundle metric h of signature (p + 1, q + 1), a line subbundle T 1 \u2282 T with isotropic fibres, and\na linear connection \u2207T which is compatible with h and satisfies a certain\nnon\u2013degeneracy condition with respect to the subbundle T 1 . These data\nare canonically associated with the conformal structure and are equivalent\nto its canonical Cartan connection.\nThe adjoint tractor bundle A \u2192 M is then defined as the bundle so(T ) of\nskew symmetric endomorphisms of T . The adjoint tractor connection \u2207A is\nthe linear connection on A induced by \u2207T . There is a canonical projection\n\u03a0 : A \u2192 T M from the adjoint tractor bundle to the tangent bundle, so in\nparticular, any section of A has an underlying vector field.\nWe will sometimes work with abstract indices, denoting tractor indices\nby A, B, . . . and tensor indices by a, b, . . . . Tractor indices are raised and\nlowered using the tractor metric h = hAB and its inverse, while tensor indices\nare raised and lowered using the conformal metric gab \u2208 \u0393(Eab [2]) and its\ninverse. Thus raising (lowering) a tensor index decreases (increases) the\nconformal weight by 2. If we use connections in abstract index computations,\nthen we will always assume that a metric from the conformal class has\nbeen chosen. The symbol \u2207a then denotes a coupled Levi\u2013Civita\u2013tractor\nconnection, i.e. it acts by the standard tractor connection on all tractor\nindices and by the Levi\u2013Civita connection on all tensor indices.\nThe curvature \u03a9 of the standard tractor connection \u2207T can be naturally\ninterpreted as an element of \u03a92 (M, A). Its abstract index representation\ntherefore has the form \u03a9ab A B . Lowering the tractor index A, the result is\nskew symmetric in both pairs of indices. The form \u03a9 also describes the\ncurvature of the canonical Cartan connection. It can be easily expressed\nexplicitly (see the proof below) in terms of the Weyl\u2013curvature C = Cab c d\nand the Cotton\u2013York tensor Aabc .\nProposition. Let s = sA B be a parallel section of the adjoint tractor bundle\nA and let k = ka denote the underlying vector field \u03a0(s). Then we have:\n(1) k is a conformal Killing field which in addition satisfies ka \u03a9ab A B = 0;\n(2) \u03a9ab A B sB A = 0.\nProof. (1) is proved in [14, Proposition 2.2] and in a much more general\nsetting in [6, Corollary 3.5].\nThe explicit formula for the tractor curvature from [14, formula (6)] reads\nas\n\u03a9abAB = ZA c ZB d Cabcd \u2212 2X[A ZB] c Acab ,\nwith the convention that the last two indices of the Cotton tensor are the\ntwo\u2013form indices. Hence from (1) we get ka Cabcd = 0 and ka Acab = 0.\nFrom Proposition 2.2 and Lemma 2.1 of [14] we get sAB = n1 DA KB , where\nKB = ZB a ka \u2212 n1 XB \u2207a ka for any choice of metric in the conformal class.\n\n\f4\n\nANDREAS \u010cAP AND A. ROD GOVER\n\nSince KB has conformal weight one, we obtain\nsAB = YA KB + ZA a \u2207a KB \u2212 n1 XA (\u2207a \u2207a + Pa a )KB .\nContracting both tractor indices with \u03a9abAB , the last summand does not\ncontribute, since \u03a9abAB X A = 0, and a short computation gives\n\u03a9abAB sAB = \u22122kc Acab + Cabcd \u2207c kd .\nFor the first term, we observe that the total alternation of the Cotton\u2013\nYork tensor vanishes. (This is a consequence of symmetry of the Schouten\ntensor Pab .) Hence\nkc Acab = kc (\u2212Abca \u2212 Aabc ),\nand we have observed above that the right hand side vanishes. Finally, the\nsymmetries of the Weyl tensor together with kb Cabcd = 0 give\nCabcd \u2207c kd = \u2212kd \u2207c Cabcd = \u2212(n \u2212 3)kd Adab = 0,\nwhere we have used the Bianchi identity in the last step. This completes\nthe proof of (2).\n\u0003\n2.2. Complex structures on standard tractors. Let us now assume\nthat dim(M ) is even and [g] is a conformal class of signature (2p\u2032 +1, 2q \u2032 +1),\nso the tractor metric has signature (2p\u2032 + 2, 2q \u2032 + 2). We will further assume\nthat we have given an orthogonal complex structure J on the standard tractor bundle T , which is possible for such a signature. Observe that since\nJ2 = J \u25e6 J = \u2212 id, orthogonality of J is equivalent to skew\u2013symmetry. Hence\nJ can be considered as a section of the adjoint tractor bundle A. Note also\nthat, using J, we can extend the tractor metric h to a Hermitian bundle\nmetric H.\nBy definition, J is parallel for \u2207A if and only if covariant derivatives by\nT\n\u2207 are complex linear. In this case \u2207T is a Hermitian connection for H\nand hence its holonomy is contained in U (p\u2032 + 1, q \u2032 + 1) \u2282 SO(2p\u2032 + 2, 2q \u2032 +\n2). Conversely, this condition on the holonomy is evidently equivalent to\nexistence of a parallel orthogonal complex structure J.\nUsing J, we can view the standard tractor bundle T as a complex vector\n\u2032\n\u2032\nbundle. In particular, we can form the complex line bundle V := \u039bpC +q +2 T ,\ni.e. the highest complex exterior power of T . The standard tractor connection \u2207T induces a linear connection \u2207V on V, and the curvature of this\nlinear connection is given by the trace of the tractor curvature, viewed as a\ncomplex linear map. More explicitly, this is the complex valued two\u2013form\n\u03a9ab A A \u2212 i\u03a9ab A B JB A . The first summand vanishes by skew symmetry while\nthe second vanishes by part (2) of Proposition 2.1. Therefore, locally the\nbundle V admits smooth sections which are parallel for the linear connection\ninduced by \u2207T .\nWe want to interpret the existence of J via a reduction of structure group\nof the canonical Cartan bundle G associated to the conformal structure. The\nCartan bundle can be easily obtained from the standard tractor bundle T\nby a frame bundle construction, see [8, 2.2]. To prepare the grounds for\nusing complex structures later, we use the underlying real vector space of\n\u2032\n\u2032\nV := Cp +q +2 as the modelling vector space for T . Fix a Hermitian inner\nproduct h , i of signature (p\u2032 + 1, q \u2032 + 1) on V as well as a real isotropic\n\n\fA HOLONOMY CHARACTERISATION OF FEFFERMAN SPACES\n\u2032\n\n5\n\n\u2032\n\np +q +2\nline LR \u2282 V, and a non-zero element \u03bd0 \u2208 \u039bC\nV. Let h , iR be the\nreal part of h , i. Let T 1 \u2282 T be the distinguished real line subbundle\nin T . Then the fibre Gx of the canonical Cartan bundle can be identified\nwith the set of all orthogonal linear isomorphisms u : VR \u2192 Tx such that\nu(LR ) = Tx1 . Fixing an element u \u2208 Gx , we obtain a bijection from the\nstabiliser P \u2282 SO(V) =: G of the line LR onto Gx . Together with the\nfact that T can be locally trivialised as a filtered metric vector bundle, this\nimplies that the disjoint union G = \u2294x\u2208M Gx can be made into a smooth\nprincipal P \u2013bundle over M . By construction, T is the associated bundle\nG \u00d7P V.\nLet g = so(V) be the Lie algebra of G and let p \u2282 g be the subalgebra corresponding to P . The canonical conformal Cartan connection \u03c9 \u2208 \u03a91 (G, g)\ncan be recovered from the standard tractor connection as follows. Since\nT = G \u00d7P V, the space \u0393(T ) of smooth sections can be naturally identified with the space C \u221e (G, V)P of smooth functions f : G \u2192 V such that\nf (u*g) = g \u22121 (f (u)) for all u \u2208 G, and all g \u2208 P \u2282 SO(V). Any vector field\n\u03be \u2208 X(M ) can be lifted (locally) to a vector field \u03be on G. For a section\ns \u2208 \u0393(T ) corresponding to f : G \u2192 V, the function inducing \u2207T\u03be s is then\ngiven by \u03be*f + \u03c9(\u03be) \u25e6 f , for any such lift \u03be. It is shown in [7, 2.7] that this\nuniquely defines a Cartan connection \u03c9 on G and normality of \u03c9 is equivalent\nto normality of \u2207T .\nNow suppose that J is an orthogonal complex structure on T . From\np\u2032 +q \u2032 +2\nabove we then know that V = \u039bC\nT admits local non\u2013vanishing parallel\nsections. Restricting to an open subset if necessary, we assume that \u03bd is a\nglobal nonzero parallel section of V. Then we define GxSU \u2282 Gx to be the\nset of those maps u, which are complex linear with respect to Jx , and which\nalso have the property that the induced isomorphism on the (p\u2032 + q \u2032 + 2)nd\ncomplex exterior power maps \u03bd0 to \u03bd(x). The subset of complex linear maps\nin SO(V) is exactly the unitary group U (V), such a map lies in SU (V), if in\np\u2032 +q \u2032 +2\naddition the induced map on \u039bC\nV preserves \u03bd0 . Thus, G SU := \u2294GxSU \u2282\nG is a principal fibre bundle over M with structure group P SU := SU (V)\u2229P .\nThis structure group is exactly the stabiliser of the real line LR in the group\nSU (V).\nNote that by elementary linear algebra SU (V) acts transitively on the\nspace of real null lines, so the inclusion SU (V) \u0592\u2192 G = SO(V) induces a\ndiffeomorphism SU (V)/P SU \u223c\n= G/P . Looking at derivatives at the base\npoints, we see that the inclusion su(V) \u0592\u2192 g = so(V) induces a linear isomorphism su(V)/pSU \u2192 g/p.\n\nProposition. The canonical conformal Cartan connection \u03c9 restricts to a\nCartan connection \u03c9 SU \u2208 \u03a91 (G SU , su(V)).\nProof. The relationship between s \u2208 \u0393(T ) and the corresponding equivariant\nfunction f \u2208 C \u221e (G, V)P is characterised by the fact that for each u \u2208 Gx we\nget s(x) = u(f (u)) \u2208 Tx . Elements of G SU are by definition complex linear\nas isomorphisms V \u2192 Tx . Consequently, if f \u0303 : G \u2192 V is the equivariant\nfunction corresponding to Js, then f \u0303(u) = if (u) for all u \u2208 G SU . Now\nassume that \u03be \u2208 X(M ) is a vector field, and consider a local lift \u03be on G SU \u2282\nG, which is tangent to G SU . Then the integral curves of \u03be\u0303 are contained\n\n\f6\n\nANDREAS \u010cAP AND A. ROD GOVER\n\nin G SU , so along these integral curves we have f \u0303 = if . Thus we have\n\u03be*f \u0303 = i(\u03be*f ), and thus \u2207T\u03be Js corresponds to i(\u03be*f ) + \u03c9(\u03be) \u25e6 if . On the\nother hand, \u2207T\u03be Js = J\u2207T\u03be s, which, along G SU corresponds to the function\ni(\u03be*f +\u03c9(\u03be)\u25e6f ). But this exactly shows that \u03c9(\u03be) is complex linear, provided\nthat \u03be is tangent to G SU .\nAccording to the observations above, we can view T as the associated\nbundle G SU \u00d7P SU V. Thus the exterior power V is the associated bundle\n\u2032\n\u2032\nG SU \u00d7P SU \u039bp +q +2 V. Now elements of SU (V) by definition act trivially on\nthis exterior power, so V is actually the trivial bundle M \u00d7 C. By construction, the section \u03bd of V corresponds to the constant function \u03bd0 . The\nrelation between \u2207V and \u03c9 is similar to the situation of \u2207T , as discussed\nabove. Using this, we can conclude that for \u03be tangent to G SU , we have\n\u03c9(\u03be) \u2208 su(V).\nHence we can restrict \u03c9 to \u03c9 SU \u2208 \u03a91 (G SU , su(V)). On each tangent\nspace, the map \u03c9 SU is evidently injective and hence bijective for dimensional\nreasons. Denoting by r g : G \u2192 G the principal right action of g \u2208 P ,\nequivariancy of \u03c9 reads as (r g )\u2217 \u03c9 = Ad(g\u22121 ) \u25e6 \u03c9. For g \u2208 P SU \u2282 P we get\nr g (G SU ) \u2282 G SU and equivariancy of \u03c9 immediately implies that (r g )\u2217 \u03c9 SU =\nAd(g\u22121 ) \u25e6 \u03c9 SU for such g. Finally, take an element A in the Lie algebra pSU\nof P SU . Viewing A as an element of p, we get the fundamental vector field\n\u03b6A \u2208 X(G) generated by A. By definition, in points of G SU \u2282 G, the field\n\u03b6A is tangent to G SU . Hence we can restrict \u03b6A to a vector field on G SU\nand by definition, this restriction coincides with the fundamental vector\nfield generated by A on this smaller principal bundle. Thus \u03c9(\u03b6A ) = A\nimplies that \u03c9 SU reproduces the generators of fundamental vector fields.\nThis completes the verification that \u03c9 SU defines a Cartan connection on\nG SU .\n\u0003\n\n2.3. Passing to a local leaf space. By part (1) of Proposition 2.1, the\nvector field ka , underlying the parallel adjoint tractor J, is a conformal\nKilling field. The argument of [9, Theorem 3.1] shows that ka is nowhere\nvanishing and by [9, 4.4] it is actually a Killing field for appropriate metrics\nin the conformal class. Since k is nowhere vanishing, it defines a rank one\nfoliation of M , and we may consider a local leaf space for this foliation. This\nmeans that for each x \u2208 M we find an open neighbourhood W of x and a\nsmooth surjective submersion \u03c8 : W \u2192 N onto some manifold N , such that\nker(Tx \u03c8) = Rk(x) for each x \u2208 W .\nA particular outcome from Proposition 2.2 is that the tangent bundle\nT M can be naturally viewed as the associated bundle G SU \u00d7P SU su(V)/pSU ,\nwhere pSU is the Lie algebra of P SU . In this picture, there is a helpful\ninterpretation of the distribution spanned by k. It is represented by the real\nspan of the class of any element A \u2208 su(V) such that A \u2212 J \u2208 p \u2282 so(V).\nBut the fact that A \u2212 tJ \u2208 p for some t \u2208 R is equivalent to the fact that A\nstabilises the complex line L \u2282 V, which is generated by LR .\nLet us denote by q \u2282 su(V) and Q \u2282 SU (V) the stabilisers of L. Then\nQ is a parabolic subgroup of SU (V) with Lie algebra q. By construction, Q\nacts on the line L and the stabiliser of the real line LR \u2282 L is the subgroup\n\n\fA HOLONOMY CHARACTERISATION OF FEFFERMAN SPACES\n\n7\n\nP SU \u2282 Q. Since the action of Q on L is evidently transitive, we see that\nQ/P SU \u223c\n= RP 1 , so in particular this quotient is connected.\nTheorem. Let (M, [g]) be a conformal manifold endowed with a parallel\northogonal complex structure J on the standard tractor bundle T and a non\nvanishing parallel section \u03bd of V. Let (p : G SU \u2192 M, \u03c9 SU ) be the Cartan\ngeometry of type (SU (V), P SU ) obtained in Proposition 2.2.\nThen, for sufficiently small local leaf spaces \u03c8 : W \u2192 N , we can find\na Cartan connection \u03c9 \u2208 \u03a91 (N \u00d7 Q, su(V)) on the trivial principal bundle\nN \u00d7Q and a P SU \u2013equivariant diffeomorphism \u03a6 from a P SU \u2013invariant open\nsubset of N \u00d7 Q onto a P SU \u2013invariant subset of G SU which pulls back \u03c9 SU\nto \u03c9.\nProof. We follow the proofs of Proposition 2.6 and Theorem 2.7 of [5], and\nrefer to the notation introduced just above the Theorem. By part (1) of\nProposition 2.1, k hooks trivially into the Cartan curvature, so the mapping\nA 7\u2192 (\u03c9 SU )\u22121 (A) \u2208 X(G SU ) is a Lie algebra homomorphism. This can be\nviewed as an action of q on G SU , and such an action integrates to a local\naction of Q on G SU . Choosing the leaf space N so small that there is a local\nsection s of G SU \u2192 W \u2192 N one finds an open neighbourhood V of P SU in\nQ which is invariant under right multiplication by elements of P SU . Using\ns, one constructs a P SU \u2013equivariant diffeomorphism \u03a6 from N \u00d7 V onto a\nP SU \u2013invariant subset of G SU , such that \u03c8 \u25e6 p \u25e6 \u03a6 = pr1 : N \u00d7 Q \u2192 N and\nfor A \u2208 q, with corresponding fundamental vector field \u03b6A \u2208 X(N \u00d7 Q), we\nhave T \u03a6 \u25e6 \u03b6A = (\u03c9 SU )\u22121 (A) \u25e6 \u03a6.\nThe fullback \u03a6\u2217 \u03c9 SU \u2208 \u03a91 (N \u00d7 V, su(V)) restricts to a linear isomorphism\non each tangent space. The restriction of this pullback to N \u00d7 {e} can be\nextended equivariantly to a Cartan connection \u03c9 \u2208 \u03a91 (N \u00d7Q, su(V)). Using\nthat k inserts trivially into the Cartan curvature, one shows that \u03c9 coincides\nwith \u03a6\u2217 \u03c9 SU locally around N \u00d7{e} and hence on N \u00d7V by equivariancy. \u0003\nCorollary. A local leaf space N as in the Theorem inherits an almost CR\nstructure of hypersurface type. Explicitly, the complex subbundle H \u2282 T N\nof corank one is the image of the orthocomplement k\u22a5 \u2282 T M .\nProof. The Cartan geometry (N \u00d7 Q, \u03c9) gives rise to an identification of\nT N with the associated bundle (N \u00d7 Q) \u00d7Q (su(V)/q) \u223c\n= N \u00d7 (su(V)/q).\nBy definition, q is the stabiliser of the complex line L \u2282 V. Now we define\nh \u2282 su(V)/q as the set of those A + q for which A(L) \u2282 L\u22a5 , where L\u22a5 is the\ncomplex orthocomplement of L. This is a well defined subspace in su(V)/q.\nFixing a nonzero element v \u2208 LR the map A + q 7\u2192 A(v) + L induces a linear\nisomorphism su(V)/q \u2192 v \u22a5R /L, where we use the real orthocomplement\nof v. This restricts to an isomorphism h \u223c\n= L\u22a5 /L, so h \u2282 su(V)/q has\nreal codimension one. Moreover, L\u22a5 /L is a complex vector space, and the\ninduced complex structure on h is independent of the choice of v. Since both\nthe subspace h and its complex structure are invariant under the natural\naction of Q, they induce a complex subbundle H \u2282 T N of real codimension\none.\nTo describe H explicitly, consider a point u \u2208 G SU \u2282 G and a tangent\nvector \u03be \u2208 Tu G SU . By definition T \u03c8*T p*\u03be lies in the CR subbundle if and\nonly if A := \u03c9(\u03be) \u2208 su(V) maps L to L\u22a5 . Let v \u2208 LR be a nonzero element.\n\n\f8\n\nANDREAS \u010cAP AND A. ROD GOVER\n\nSince A is orthogonal, we have hA(v), viR = 0, and using that A is complex\nlinear we see that A(L) \u2282 L\u22a5 if and only if hA(v), iviR = 0. But, by construction, on the subbundle G SU , the element i id +p \u2208 so(V)/p corresponds\nto the vector field k. Since the conformal structure is induced by h , iR , the\nexplicit description of H follows.\n\u0003\n2.4. The curvature of the reduced Cartan connection. The next step\nis to show that the almost CR structure from Corollary 2.3 is non\u2013degenerate\nof signature (p\u2032 , q \u2032 ) and integrable. We will prove more than that, namely\nthat the Cartan geometry (N \u00d7 Q, \u03c9) is torsion free and normal, which\nalso implies that it is the canonical Cartan geometry associated to this CR\nstructure. To study these issues, we have to understand the curvature of \u03c9.\nFor a sufficiently small local leaf space \u03c8 : W \u2192 N , Theorem 2.3 provides\nus with a Cartan geometry of type (SU (V), Q) on N . Regular Cartan geometries of that type induce an underlying partially integrable almost CR\nstructure, and conversely, a partially integrable almost CR structure gives\nrise to a unique regular normal Cartan connection, see [9, 2.3] and [10, 4.15].\nRecall that the curvature of the Cartan connection \u03c9 \u2208 \u03a91 (G, g) is the\ntwo form K \u2208 \u03a92 (G, g) defined by K(\u03be, \u03b7) = d\u03c9(\u03be, \u03b7) + [\u03c9(\u03be), \u03c9(\u03b7)] for\n\u03be, \u03b7 \u2208 X(G). The defining properties of a Cartan connection immediately\nimply that this form is horizontal and and P \u2013equivariant. Using the trivialisation of T\u0001G provided by \u03c9, one obtains the curvature function \u03ba : G \u2192\nL \u039b2 (g/p), g , which is characterised by\n\u03ba(u)(X + p, Y + p) := K(\u03c9 \u22121 (X)(u), \u03c9 \u22121 (Y )(u)).\nThis is well defined since K is horizontal and equivariancy of\n\u0001 K implies that\n2\n\u03ba is equivariant for the natural P \u2013action on L \u039b (g/p), g . On the other\nhand, composing the inverse of the isomorphism su(V)/pSU \u2192 g/p induced\nby inclusion, with a natural projection, we obtain a natural surjection g/p \u2192\nsu(V)/q.\nLemma. In the situation of Theorem 2.3, the restriction of the curvature\nfunction \u03ba of \u03c9 to the domain of \u03a6 is related to the curvature function \u03ba of\nthe conformal Cartan connection \u03c9 by the commutative diagram\n\u039b2 (g/p)\n\u000f\n\u0001\n\u039b2 su(V)/q\n\n\u03ba\u25e6\u03a6\n\n\u03ba\n\n/g\nO\n\n/ su(V),\n\nwhere we view G SU as a subspace of G, and the vertical arrows are the natural\nsurjection, respectively the natural inclusion. This completely determines \u03ba.\nProof. Since \u03c9 SU is simply a restriction of \u03c9, the definition of the curvature\nimmediately implies that K SU is the restriction of K to G SU . (This restriction automatically has values in the algebra su(V) \u2282 g.) In the proof of\nTheorem 2.3 we have seen that on the domain of \u03a6, \u03c9 coincides with \u03a6\u2217 \u03c9 SU .\nAgain by definition of the curvature, this shows that K = \u03a6\u2217 (K SU ). Moreover, for X \u2208 su(V) we get T \u03a6 \u25e6 \u03c9 \u22121 (X) = (\u03c9 SU )\u22121 (X) \u25e6 \u03a6 = \u03c9 \u22121 (X) \u25e6\n\u03a6. Together with the above, we get for another element Y \u2208 su(V) and\n\n\fA HOLONOMY CHARACTERISATION OF FEFFERMAN SPACES\n\n9\n\nall points a in the domain of \u03a6 the equation K(a)(\u03c9 \u22121 (X), \u03c9 \u22121 (Y )) =\nK(\u03a6(a))(\u03c9 \u22121 (X), \u03c9 \u22121 (Y )). But the natural surjection g/p \u2192 su(V)/q by\ndefinition maps X + p to X + q (and is even characterised by that), so we\nobtain the claimed relation between \u03ba and \u03ba. Since the domain of \u03a6 contains N \u00d7 {e} and the curvature function \u03ba is Q\u2013equivariant, we see that\n\u0003\nthis relation determines \u03ba.\n2.5. The characterisation theorem. To prove our main result, we have\nto verify one more property of the conformal Killing field underlying a parallel complex structure on the standard tractor bundle.\nLemma. Let (M, [g]) be a conformal manifold endowed with a parallel complex structure J on the standard tractor bundle, let ka be the conformal\nKilling field underlying J (see 2.1), and let \u03a9ab A B be the Cartan curvature.\nThen for the Levi\u2013Civita connection \u2207 of a preferred scale in the sense of\n[9, 4.4], we have \u03a9ab A B \u2207a kb = 0.\nProof. By the explicit formula for \u03a9ab A B in the proof of Proposition 2.1 it\nsuffices to show that Cabcd \u2207a kb = 0 and Acab \u2207a kb = 0. In that proof, we\nhave seen that Cabcd \u2207c kd = 0, so the first equation follows by the symmetries\nof the Weyl curvature. Using the covariant derivative of this equation, we\nobtain\nAcab \u2207a kb =\n\nd\na b\n1\nn\u22123 (\u2207 Cabdc )(\u2207 k )\n\n=\n\nd a b\n\u22121\nn\u22123 Cabdc \u2207 \u2207 k .\n\nThere is an explicit formula for JAB in part (5) of Proposition 4.4 of [9]\nin terms of any preferred scale. Expanding 0 = Z A a Z B b \u2207d JAB using this\nformula, we obtain\n0 = \u2207d \u2207a kb + 2Pd[a kb] + 2gd[a lb] .\nInserting this into the above equation we get zero by the trace-freeness of\nCabcd and since ka Cabcd = 0, which was observed in Proposition 2.1.\n\u0003\nHaving this technical result at hand, we can proceed to the main results\nfor the characterisation.\nProposition. The Cartan geometry (N \u00d7 Q, \u03c9) obtained in Theorem 2.3 is\ntorsion free (and hence regular) and normal. Thus it induces on the local\nleaf space N a CR structure of hypersurface type, which is non\u2013degenerate\nof signature (p\u2032 , q \u2032 ), as well as an appropriate root E(1, 0) of the canonical\nbundle, see [9, 2.3].\nProof. Lemma 2.4 describes the curvature \u03ba of \u03c9. For u \u2208 im(\u03a6) \u2282 G SU , the\nmap \u03ba(u) : \u039b2 (g/p) \u2192 g descends to \u039b2 (su(V)/q) and has values in su(V).\nFirst observe that since \u03ba(u) is normal in the conformal sense, it is torsion\nfree, so we conclude that the values actually lie in su(V) \u2229 p = pSU \u2282 q.\nThis shows that \u03c9 is torsion free and hence regular as a Cartan connection\non N \u00d7 Q. Regularity implies that the induced almost CR structure on\nN (as described in Corollary 2.3) is non\u2013degenerate of signature (p\u2032 , q \u2032 ) and\npartially integrable. Moreover, once we have proved that \u03c9 is normal, torsion\nfreeness implies that the structure is integrable (and hence CR) by [10, 4.16].\nThe bundle E(1, 0) can be defined as (N \u00d7Q)\u00d7Q L which immediately implies\nthat it has the required properties.\n\n\f10\n\nANDREAS \u010cAP AND A. ROD GOVER\n\nHence the proof boils down to showing that, if we interpret \u03ba(u) as a map\n\u2192 su(V), then it satisfies the normalisation condition \u2202 \u2217 \u25e6\u03ba = 0\nfor Cartan geometries of type (SU (V), Q). Having proved this, normality of\n\u03c9 immediately follows from Q\u2013equivariancy of \u2202 \u2217 .\nTo compute \u2202 \u2217 \u25e6 \u03ba we have to choose various bases. First, there is an\nabelian subalgebra p+ \u2282 p \u2282 g which consists of all maps Z \u2208 g which\nR\nvanish on LR and map its real orthocomplement L\u22a5\nR to LR . Skew symmetry\nR\nthen implies that all values of Z lie in L\u22a5\nR . The Killing form of g induces a\nduality between p+ and g/p.\nSimilarly, we obtain a subalgebra q+ \u2282 q \u2282 su(V) by taking all maps Z\nwhich vanish on L and map L\u22a5 to L. Again, the Killing form induces a\nduality between su(V)/q and q+ . However, in the complex case, there is a\nfiner decomposition. Namely, there is a subspace q2 \u2282 q+ of real dimension\n1, which consists of those maps that vanish identically on L\u22a5 . (In the real\ncase, the analogous condition already forces a map to vanish identically).\nThe annihilator of q2 is the (real) codimension one subspace h \u2282 su(V)/q\nused in the proof of Corollary 2.3.\nSince the Killing form on a simple Lie algebra is uniquely determined\nup to multiples by invariance, we may in both cases use the trace form on\ng for obtaining the dualities on both algebras. This only replaces \u2202 \u2217 by\na non-zero multiple, so it has no effect on normality. Now let us chose a\nnon-zero element X0 \u2208 su(V) such that X0 + q \u2208\n/ h. Next, choose elements\nX1 , . . . , X2n\u2032 (where n\u2032 = p\u2032 + q \u2032 ) such that {X1 + q, . . . , X2n\u2032 + q} is a basis\nof h. Finally, put X2n\u2032 +1 := i* id \u2208 g. Then {X0 + p, . . . , X2n\u2032 +1 + p} is\na basis for g/p. By duality, there are unique elements Z0 , . . . , Z2n\u2032 +1 \u2208 p+\nsuch that tr(Xi \u25e6 Zj ) = \u03b4ij , so {Z0 , . . . , Z2n\u2032 +1 } is the dual basis of p+ .\nOn the other hand, for j = 0, . . . , 2n\u2032 let Z j be the complex linear part\nof the linear map Zj , i.e. Z j (v) = 21 (Zj (v) \u2212 iZj (iv)). This means that\nZj \u2212 Z j is conjugate linear, and since each Xi is complex linear, the map\nXi \u25e6 (Zj \u2212 Z j ) is conjugate linear. But such a map has vanishing real trace,\nso we conclude that tr(Xi \u25e6 Z j ) = \u03b4ij . Using this for X2n\u2032 +1 = i* id, we in\nparticular see that the Z j \u2208 su(V) for j = 0, . . . , 2n\u2032 .\nNext, take a nonzero element v \u2208 LR . By the definition of p+ , each\nR\nZj (L\u22a5\nR ) \u2282 LR , so Zj (iv) = av for some a \u2208 R. But then i* id \u25e6Zj maps iv to\naiv, and looking at an appropriate basis extending {v, iv} one concludes that\ntr(i* id \u25e6Zj ) = 2a. Hence Zj |L = 0, and therefore Z j |L = 0 for j = 0, * * * , 2n\u2032 .\nR\nFor w \u2208 L\u22a5 all complex multiples of w lie in L\u22a5\nR , so Z j (w) \u2208 L. Thus we\n\u2032\nconclude that Z j \u2208 q+ for all j = 0, . . . , 2n and hence {Z 0 , . . . , Z 2n\u2032 } is the\nbasis of q+ which is dual to the basis {X0 + q, . . . , X2n\u2032 + q} of su(V)/q.\nNow the formula for \u2202 \u2217 (\u03ba(u)) : su(V)/q \u2192 su(V) has two summands, see\n[17, section 5.1]. The first summand is\n\u039b2 (su(V)/q)\n\n\u2032\n\n2n\nX\n[\u03ba(u)(X + q, Xj + q), Z j ],\nX + q 7\u2192\nj=0\n\nwhere the bracket is the commutator of linear maps. Since \u03ba(u)(X+q, Xj +q)\nP \u2032\nis complex linear, this is the complex linear part of 2n\nj=0 [\u03ba(u)(X + q, Xj +\nq), Zj ]. Now inside \u03ba(u), we can replace X +q and Xj +q by X +p and Xj +p,\n\n\fA HOLONOMY CHARACTERISATION OF FEFFERMAN SPACES\n\n11\n\nrespectively, which just corresponds to viewing \u03ba(u) as a map \u039b2 g/p \u2192\nsu(V). Moreover, we may sum up to 2n\u2032 + 1 without changing the result\nsince \u03ba(u) descends to su(V)/q. (This corresponds to the fact that k hooks\ntrivially into \u03ba.) Thus have expressed the first summand as the complex\nP \u2032 +1\nlinear part of 2n\nj=0 [\u03ba(u)(X +p, Xj +p), Zj ], and the bracket is the same as\nin g. But by the choice of our bases, the condition that the conformal Cartan\nP \u2032 +1\nconnection \u03c9 is normal exactly reads as 2n\nj=0 [\u03ba(u)(X + p, Xj + p), Zj ] = 0.\nThus we are left with the second summand, which is\n\u2032\n\n(\u2217)\n\nX + q 7\u2192\n\n1\n2\n\n2n\nX\n\n\u03ba(u)([X, Z j ] + q, Xj + q).\n\nj=0\n\nWe have already observed that Z j vanishes on L, so [X, Z j ](L) = Z j (X(L)).\nIf X + q \u2208 h \u2282 su(V)/q, then Z j (X(L)) \u2282 Z j (L\u22a5 ) \u2282 L, and hence [X, Z j ] \u2208\nq. Therefore, it suffices to show that (\u2217) vanishes for X = X0 .\nTake a nonzero element v \u2208 LR . In the proof of Corollary 2.3 we have\nseen that X + q 7\u2192 X(v) + L induces a linear isomorphism h \u2192 L\u22a5 /L, which\nwas used to define the complex structure on h. Fixing w \u2208 V such that\nhv, wi = 1, one easily verifies, in a basis, that the restriction of the traceform\nto h \u00d7 q+ is a nonzero real multiple of (X + q, Z) 7\u2192 hZ(X(v)), wiR .\nNow for our basis element X0 , by definition we have X0 (v) \u2208\n/ L\u22a5 . Since\nX0 (v) 6= 0, it must be congruent to a nonzero, purely imaginary multiple of w modulo L\u22a5 . Further, for j = 1, . . . , 2n\u2032 we have Z j \u2208 q+ so\nZ j |L = 0 and since Z j is skew Hermitian, this also implies Z j (V) \u2282 L\u22a5 .\nHence [X0 , Z j ](v) = \u2212Z j (X0 (v)) \u2208 L\u22a5 . On the one hand, this shows that\n[X0 , Z j ] + q \u2208 h. On the other hand, together with the above we see that\nthere is a nonzero real number a such that\nhX(v), i[X0 , Z j ](v)iR = \u2212hX(v), iZ j (X0 (v))iR = a tr(X \u25e6 Z j ).\nNow (X +q, Y +q) 7\u2192 hX(v), Y (v)iR defines a non\u2013degenerate inner product\non h. Hence there are unique elements Yj + q \u2208 h for j = 1, . . . , 2n\u2032 such that\nhXk (v), Yj (v)iR = \u03b4kj . Applying the last displayed formula to X = Xk we\nconclude that [X0 , Z j ] + q = \u2212ia(Yj + q). Therefore, normality is equivalent\nto\n\u2032\n\n(\u2217\u2217)\n\n2n\nX\n\n\u03ba(u)(i(Yj + q), Xj + q) = 0.\n\nj=1\n\nThis expression admits an interpretation on M . Similar to the linear isomorphism h \u2192 L\u22a5 /L, a nonzero element v \u2208 LR also gives rise to a linear\nR\nisomorphism g/p \u2192 L\u22a5\nR /LR . Now h , iR induces an inner product on\nR\nL\u22a5\nR /LR which can be carried over to g/p. Passing to the associated bundle G \u00d7P (g/p) the resulting class of inner products induces the conformal\nstructure on M . In particular, L\u22a5 /L (together with the class of inner products induced by h , iR ) corresponds to a subquotient of the tangent spaces\nof M . Choosing a preferred metric from the conformal class, sections 4.4\nand 4.5 of [9] show that this subquotient can be naturally identified with\nH\u0303 = k\u22a5 \u2229 l\u22a5 \u2282 T M . Moreover, by [9, Proposition 4.4], the endomorphism\n\u2207a kb of T M vanishes on k and l, and it represents the complex structure\n\n\f12\n\nANDREAS \u010cAP AND A. ROD GOVER\n\non H\u0303 obtained from the identification with L\u22a5 /L. But this exactly means\nthat the left hand side of (\u2217\u2217) corresponds to \u03a9abAB \u2207a kb , which vanishes\nby the Lemma above.\n\u0003\nTheorem. Let (M, [g]) be a conformal structure of signature (2p\u2032 +1, 2q \u2032 +1)\nsuch that there is a parallel orthogonal complex structure J on the standard\ntractor bundle. Then locally M is conformally isometric to the Fefferman\nspace of a CR manifold of hypersurface type, which is non\u2013degenerate of\nsignature (p\u2032 , q \u2032 ) endowed with an appropriate root E(1, 0) of the canonical\nbundle in such a way the J corresponds to the canonical complex structure\nintroduced in [9].\nProof. Take an open subset W \u2282 M and a local leaf space \u03c8 : W \u2192 N\nas in Theorem 2.3. By the Proposition above we get a CR structure of the\nrequired type on N , and (N \u00d7Q, \u03c9) is the canonical normal Cartan geometry\nassociated to this structure. By construction, P SU \u2282 Q is the stabiliser of\nthe real isotropic line LR \u2282 L \u2282 V. Taking (N \u00d7 Q) \u00d7Q L as E(\u22121, 0),\nthe Fefferman space \u00d1 of N is simply N \u00d7 (Q/P SU ), endowed with the\nCartan geometry (N \u00d7 Q \u2192 N \u00d7 (Q/P SU ), \u03c9). Theorem 2.3 exactly says\nthat this Cartan geometry is locally isomorphic to (p : G SU \u2192 M, \u03c9 SU ),\nwhich by the construction in [9, Theorem 2.4 and 3.1] implies that M is\nlocally isometric to \u00d1 in a way compatible with the complex structures on\nstandard tractors.\n\u0003\n3. A strengthening of Sparling's characterisation\nFrom some points of view, the local characterisation of Fefferman spaces\nin Theorem 2.5 is rather satisfactory. The characterisation uses only conformally invariant data, and it is very conceptual through its relation to\nconformal holonomy. On the other hand, at first sight it would seem to\nbe much weaker than the characterisation due to Sparling as described in\nTheorem 3.1 of [15]. This characterisation says that if (M, g) is a pseudoRiemannian manifold, of appropriate signature, which admits an isotropic\nKilling field k with the properties that it inserts trivially into both the Weyl\ncurvature and the Cotton tensor, while Ric(k, k) > 0, then M is locally\nconformally isometric to a Fefferman space.\nNow as shown in [14, Proposition 2.2] and in [6, Corollary 3.5], parallel\nsections of the adjoint tractor bundle A of any conformal manifold M are\nin bijective correspondence with conformal Killing fields which insert trivially into the Weyl curvature and the Cotton\u2013York tensor. Given such a\nconformal Killing field k, one can view the corresponding parallel adjoint\ntractor as an endomorphism J of the standard tractor bundle T , and express\nthe condition that J \u25e6 J = \u2212id in terms of k and its covariant derivatives.\nExpressing J \u25e6 J = \u2212id in this way, one is quickly led to see this includes the\nproperties required in Sparling's characterisation (see subsection 4.4 of [9]).\nHowever pushing through the calculation na\u0131\u0308vely at first suggests that many\nmore conditions arise than are needed for the Sparling characterisation. In\nfact a direct but tedious calculation reveals that the remaining identities are\nall differential consequences of the conditions in Sparling's characterisation.\n\n\fA HOLONOMY CHARACTERISATION OF FEFFERMAN SPACES\n\n13\n\nThere is however an elegant and insightful way to do this using deeper\nmethods from conformal geometry. As a bonus we obtain a variant of Sparling's characterisation which is stronger by dint of conformal invariance.\nTheorem. Let (M, [g]) be a conformal manifold of dimension n \u2265 3 and\nlet s \u2208 \u0393(A) be a parallel section with underlying conformal Killing field k,\nand suppose that k is isotropic. Then for any metric in the conformal class,\nwith Levi\u2013Civita connection \u2207 and Schouten tensor P, the function\n1\n(\u2207a ka )2\nn2\n\n\u2212 ka Pab kb \u2212 n1 ka \u2207a \u2207b kb\n\nis equal to some constant \u03bb \u2208 R. This constant is independent of the choice\nof metric from the conformal class and s \u25e6 s = \u03bb id \u2208 \u0393(End(T )).\nProof. As an endomorphism of T , s is skew symmetric and hence s \u25e6 s \u2208\n\u0393(S 2 T ). Now S 2 T invariantly decomposes into the trace-free part S02 T and\nR id. Since s is a parallel section of End(T ), s \u25e6s is a parallel section of S 2 T ,\nand hence it is the sum of a parallel section of S02 T and a constant multiple\nof the identity. Now the canonical filtration T 1 \u2282 T 0 \u2282 T with T 0 := (T 1 )\u22a5\ninduces a filtration of S02 T . The largest filtration component is the image\nof T 0 \u2297 T in S02 T (under the obvious projection) and the quotient of S02 T\nby this filtration component is isomorphic to S 2 (T /T 0 ) \u223c\n= E[2]. If tAB is a\n2\nsection of S0 T then the projection to this quotient is given by XA tAB XB .\nNow we can use the explicit formula for sAB in terms of KB := ZBb kb \u2212\n1\nb\nn XB \u2207b k from the proof of Proposition 2.1. This, in particular, implies\nA\nX sAB = KB , as well as\nK B sBC = \u2212 n1 KC \u2207b kb + ka \u2207a KC .\nThis shows that X A sA C sC B XB = \u2212ka ka = 0. But a simple corollary\nof the machinery of BGG sequences developed in [11] and [4] is that any\nparallel section of an indecomposable tractor bundle can be recovered, by\nan invariant differential operator, from its projection to the quotient by the\nlargest filtration component.\nHence s \u25e6 s = \u03bb idT for some constant \u03bb \u2208 R, and we can compute this\nconstant for example as X A sA C sC B YB = K B sBC Y C . The formula for \u03bb\nthen follows easily by expanding the above expression for K B sBC .\n\u0003\nUsing this, we obtain a strengthening of Sparling's characterisation as\nwell as surprising information about odd dimensional manifolds admitting\nisotropic normal conformal Killing fields.\nCorollary. Let M be a pseudo-Riemannian manifold of dimension n \u2265 3\nand let k be an isotropic conformal Killing field, which inserts trivially into\nthe Weyl curvature and (the 2\u2013form indices of ) the Cotton\u2013York tensor.\n(1) If n is even and the constant\na 2\n1\nn2 (\u2207a k )\n\n\u2212 ka Pab kb \u2212 n1 ka \u2207a \u2207b kb\n\nis negative, then M is locally conformally isometric to a Fefferman space\n\u00d1 , of a CR manifold N , in such a way that k is mapped to a generator of\nthe vertical subbundle of \u00d1 \u2192 N .\n(2) If n is odd, then\n1\n(\u2207a ka )2\nn2\n\n\u2212 ka Pab kb \u2212 n1 ka \u2207a \u2207b kb = 0\n\n\f14\n\nANDREAS \u010cAP AND A. ROD GOVER\n\nand the adjoint tractor field s corresponding to k satisfies s \u25e6 s = 0.\nProof. (1) Passing to a constant rescaling of k, we obtain a conformal Killing\nfield such that the associated parallel adjoint tractor defines an almost complex structure. Then the result follows from the theorem.\n(2) Since n is odd, the tractor bundle T has odd rank, so the skew symmetric\nmap s : T \u2192 T has to be degenerate. Then s \u25e6 s = \u03bb id is only possible for\n\u03bb = 0, and the result follows.\n\u0003\nRemarks. (1) If in part (1) of the corollary we assume that k is a Killing\nfield rather than just a conformal Killing field, then \u2207a ka = 0, and the\nconstant in question simply becomes \u2212ka Pab kb . Since k is isotropic, this is\na nonzero multiple of Ric(k, k), and we recover Sparling's characterisation.\nNote that in contrast to Ric(k, k) > 0, negativity of the constant in (1)\ndoes not evidently imply that k is nowhere vanishing. We get this as a\nconsequence of the corollary.\n(2) In section 4 of [15] it is shown how to deduce a global characterisation\nof Fefferman spaces from the local one.\n(3) In the odd\u2013dimensional case, the kernel of s is nontrivial in each point.\nIf the dimension of these kernels is constant, then they form a smooth subbundle in the standard tractor bundle. Since s is parallel, this subbundle is\ninvariant under the standard tractor connection. In particular, this implies\nthat the conformal holonomy cannot act irreducibly.\nReferences\n[1] S.
