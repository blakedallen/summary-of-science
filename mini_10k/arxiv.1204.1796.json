Denote by\nk(G) the fixed field k(xg : g \u2208 G)G . Noether's problem asks whether k(G) is rational\n(= purely transcendental) over k. It is related to the inverse Galois problem, to the\nexistence of generic G-Galois extensions over k, and to the existence of versal G-torsors\nover k-rational field extensions [Sw2; Sa1; GMS, 33.1, p. 86]. Noether's problem for\nabelian groups was studied by Swan, Voskresenskii, Endo, Miyata and Lenstra, etc.\nThe reader is referred to Swan's paper for a survey of this problem [Sw2].\nOn the other hand, just a handful of results about Noether's problem for non-abelian\ngroups are obtained.\nBefore stating the main results of this paper, we recall a notion introduced by\nSaltman, retract rationality, which is weaker than rationality, but is still very useful.\nDefinition 1.1 Let k \u2282 K be an extension of fields. K is rational over k (for short,\nk-rational) if K is purely transcendental over k. K is stably k-rational if K(y1 , . . . , ym )\nis rational over k for some y1 , . . . , ym such that y1 , . . . , ym are algebraically independent\nover K.\nWhen k is an infinite field, K is said to be retract k-rational if there is a k-algebra\nA contained in K such that (i) K is the quotient field of A, (ii) there exist a nonzero polynomial f \u2208 k[X1 , . . . , Xn ] (where k[X1 , . . . , Xn ] is the polynomial ring) and\nk-algebra morphisms \u03c6 : A \u2192 k[X1 , . . . , Xn ][1/f ] and \u03c8 : k[X1 , . . . , Xn ][1/f ] \u2192 A satisfying \u03c8 \u25e6 \u03c6 = 1A . See [Sa2; Ka4] for details.\nIt is not difficult to see that \"k-rational\" \u21d2 \"stably k-rational\" \u21d2 \"retract krational\". Note that k(G) is retract k-rational is equivalent to the existence of a\ngeneric G-Galois extension over k [Sa1; Sa2; Ka4, Theorem 1.2].\nThe following result ensures that k(G) is retract k-rational is as good as Noether's\nproblem for solving the inverse Galois problem. The reader is referred to Serre's monograph [Se] for Hilbert's irreducibility theorem and the inverse Galois problem.\nTheorem 1.2 Let G be a finite group, and k be an infinite field such that Hilbert's\nirreducibility theorem is valid (e.g. k is an algebraic number field). If k(G) is retract k-rational, then there is a Galois extension field K over k whose Galois group is\nisomorphic to G.\nProof. Write E = k(xg : g \u2208 G) and F = E G = k(G). Since k(G) is retract\nk-rational, there is k-algebra A in F such that the quotient field of A is F , and the\nk-algebra morphisms \u03c6 : A \u2192 k[X1 , . . . , Xn ][1/f ] and \u03c8 : k[X1 , . . . , Xn ][1/f ] \u2192 A satisfying \u03c8 \u25e6 \u03c6 = 1A .\nLet B be the integral closure of A in E. Write E = F (\u03b8) for some primitive element\n\u03b8. We may assume that \u03b8 \u2208 B and B is a Galois extension of A with group G (see\n[Sw2, Section 3] for details).\n2\n\n\fSince A[\u03b8] and B have the same quotient field, there exist elements s, t \u2208 A such\nthat A[\u03b8][1/s] = B[1/t] by [Sw1, Lemma 8]. Further localization will ensure that\nA[\u03b8] = B. In short, we have a Galois extension B over A and the k-algebra morphisms\n\u03c6 : A \u2192 k[X1 , . . . , Xn ][1/f ] and \u03c8 : k[X1 , . . . , Xn ][1/f ] \u2192 A such that B = A[\u03b8].\nLet g(T ) \u2208 A[T ] be the minimum polynomial of \u03b8 over F where T is a variable which\nis algebraic independent over k(X1 , . . . , Xn ) (and over F via the injective morphism\n\u03c6). Write g(T ) = T m + a1 T m\u22121 + * * * + am for some elements a1 , * * * , am \u2208 A with\nm = |G|. Note that g(T ) is an irreducible polynomial in F [T ]. Define h(T ) = T m +\n\u03c6(a1 )T m\u22121 + * * * + \u03c6(am ). We claim that h(T ) \u2208 k(X1 , . . . , Xn )[T ] is an irreducible\npolynomial over k(X1 , . . . , Xn ) ; otherwise, applying the morphism \u03c8 would lead to a\ncontradiction.\nNow we may apply Hilbert's irreducibility theorem. There is a k-specialization\n\u03bb : k[X1 , . . . , Xn ][1/f ] \u2192 k such that T m +\u03bb(\u03c6(a1 ))T m\u22121 +* * *+\u03bb(\u03c6(am )) is irreducible\nin k[T ]. Thus \u03bb \u25e6 \u03c6 : A \u2192 k is the k-specialization we need. The remaining proof is\nsimilar to [Sw2, Section 3].\n\u0004\nNow we turn to Frobenius groups.\nDefinition 1.3 ([Is, pages 181\u2013182]) A finite group G is called a Frobenius group if\nG = N \u22ca G0 where N and G0 are non-trivial subgroups of G satisfying (i) N is a\nnormal subgroup of G, and (ii) the action of G0 on N is fixed point free, i.e. for any\nx \u2208 N\\{1}, any g \u2208 G0 \\{1}, gxg \u22121 6= x.\nIn other words, a group G is a Frobenius group if and only if the celebrated Frobenius Theorem in representation theory is valid for G [Ro, Theorem 8.5.5, page 243].\nIn this situation, the normal subgroup N is called the Frobenius kernel of G, and the\nsubgroup G0 (or any of its conjugates in G) is called a Frobenius complement of G.\nA group is called a Frobenius complement (resp. a Frobenius kernel) if it is a\nFrobenius complement (resp. a Frobenius kernel) of some Frobenius group.\nTheorem 1.4 ([Ro, page 299; Is, Chapter 6]) Let G = N \u22ca G0 be a Frobenius group\nwith kernel N and complement G0 .\n(1) (John T hompson) N is a nilpotent group.\n(2) (Burnside) The p-Sylow subgroups of G0 are cyclic if p \u2265 3, while the 2-Sylow\nsubgroups of G0 are cyclic or generalized quaternion.\nFrobenius groups and Frobenius complements are ubiquitous in various mathematical areas (see Section 2). We will coin some names for these groups.\nDefinition 1.5 Following the terminology used by Suzuki [Su], a finite group G is\ncalled a Z-group if all of its Sylow subgroups are cyclic. Imitating this usage, we called\na finite G a GZ-group if the p-Sylow subgroups of G are cyclic for p \u2265 3 and the\n2-Sylow subgroups of G are cyclic or generalized quaternion.\nFrom Theorem 1.4, we find that the Frobenius complements are GZ-groups.\nThe purpose of this paper is to study the rationality problems of Frobenius groups\nand Frobenius complements. But let us discuss an example first.\n3\n\n\fExample 1.6 Let p, q be distinct odd prime numbers. Define G = h\u03c3, \u03c4 : \u03c3 p = \u03c4 q =\n1, \u03c4 \u03c3\u03c4 \u22121 = \u03c3 r i where 2 \u2264 r \u2264 p \u2212 1 and r q \u2261 1 (mod p). Then G is a Frobenius\ngroup and G \u2243 Cp \u22ca Cq . By Theorem 3.9, if [\u03b6q ] is a unique factorization domain,\nthen (Cp \u22ca Cq ) is rational over . However, when [\u03b6q ] is not a unique factorization\ndomain, it is still unknown whether (Cp \u22ca Cq ) is rational or not.\n\nC\n\nC\n\nZ\n\nC\n\nZ\n\nBecause of the above example, we will study the retract rationality of k(G) where\nk is a field satisfying mild assumptions, and G is a GZ-group, a Frobenius complement\nor a Frobenius group with abelian kernel. We will not aim at the rationality problem\nfor these groups in this paper. The rationality problem of (G) where G = ( /p ) \u22ca\n( /p )\u00d7 was indeed explored by Samson Breuer [Br] (when p is a prime number with\np \u2264 19); we will study the rationality problem for these groups in a separate paper.\nThe retract rationality for a Frobenius group with abelian kernel is a consequence\nof that for GZ-groups (for the details about the results for GZ-groups, see Section 4).\nWe list our results for Frobenius groups as follows.\n\nQ\n\nZ Z\n\nZ Z\n\nTheorem 1.7 Let G be a solvable Frobenius group of exponent e = 2u 3l n (where\nu, l \u2265 0, 2 \u2224 n, 3 \u2224 n), and k be an infinite field with char k 6= 2, 3, and \u03b62u\u2032 , \u03b63l \u2208 k\nwhere u\u2032 = max{u, 3}. If the Frobenius kernel of G is an abelian group, then k(G) is\nretract k-rational.\nTheorem 1.8 Let G be a non-solvable Frobenius group. If k is an infinite field with\nchar k = 2 or char k = 0 such that k(\u03b68 ) is a cyclic extension of k, then k(G) is retract\nk-rational.\nNote that, in Theorem 1.8, the assumption that the Frobenius kernel is abelian is\nunnecessary because of Theorem 2.1 and Theorem 2.9. A criterion of retract rationality\nwhen the Frobenius complement is a Z-group and the Frobenius kernel is abelian is\ngiven in Theorem 4.2.\nExample 1.9 Let p be a prime number with p \u2261 1 (mod 8). Choose an integer r such\nthat 2 \u2264 r \u2264 p \u2212 1 and the order of r in ( /p )\u00d7 is 8. Define G = h\u03c3, \u03c4 : \u03c3 p = \u03c4 8 =\n1, \u03c4 \u03c3\u03c4 \u22121 = \u03c3 r i. Then G is a Frobenius group and G \u2243 Cp \u22ca C8 . We claim that (G)\nis not retract -rational. Otherwise, (C8 ) would be retract -rational by Theorem\n3.1. But this is impossible by Theorem 3.2.\nThe above example illustrates that, in Theorem 1.7, the assumption that \u03b68 \u2208 k is\ncrucial. A similar situation happens to Theorem 1.8; see Example 4.12.\n\nZ Z\n\nQ\n\nQ\n\nQ\n\nQ\n\nApplying Theorem 1.7 and Theorem 1.8 together with Theorem 1.2, we deduce\nresults of the inverse Galois problem. We record only results for non-solvable Frobenius\ngroups.\nTheorem 1.10 Let G a non-solvable Frobenius group. If k is an algebraic number\nfield such that k(\u03b68 ) is a cyclic extension of k, then there is a Galois extension field K\nover k whose Galois group is isomorphic to G.\n4\n\n\fAccording to Suzuki's classification (see Theorem 2.8), there are two types of nonsolvable Frobenius groups. The result in Theorem 1.8 for the type (I) group in Theorem\n2.8 may be sharpened as follows.\nTheorem 1.11 Let k be a field with char k = 0, G be a Frobenius group whose Frobenius complement is isomorphic to G1 \u00d7 G2 where G1 is a Z-group and G2 \u2243 SL2 ( 5 ).\nThen k(G) is retract k-rational.\n\nF\n\nA corollary of the above theorem is the following.\nTheorem 1.12 Let k be an algebraic number field, G be a Frobenius group whose Frobenius complement is isomorphic to G1 \u00d7 G2 where G1 is a Z-group and G2 \u2243 SL2 ( 5 ).\nThen there is a Galois extension field K over k whose Galois group is isomorphic to\nG.\n\nF\n\nWe note that it is possible to solve the inverse Galois problem in Theorem 1.12 by\nother methods using [Fe; Me; ILF, page 55, Theorem 3.12] or [MM, page 326, Theorem\n8.1].\nThe proof of Theorem 1.7, Theorem 1.8 and Theorem 1.11 will be given at the\nend of Section 4. We use Saltman's result (Theorem 3.1) and the structure theorems\nof Frobenius groups as a method of reduction process. The structure theorems of\nFrobenius groups were investigated by Zassenhaus, Suzuki, Wolf and other people\n[Za1; Su; Wo]. We summarize these results in Section 2. However, to prove the\nretract rationality is rather tricky. Sometimes we should prove the stronger result of\nrationality in order to prove the retract rationality; thus we are reduced to solving\nNoether's problem for the corresponding groups. For example, Theorem 4.4 proves\nthat k(G1 ) and k(G2 ) are k-rational where G1 \u2243 Q8 \u22ca C3l , G2 is defined by the group\nextension 1 \u2192 G1 \u2192 G2 \u2192 C2 \u2192 1 (Q8 is the quaternion group of order 8) and k is a\nfield containing \u03b6e with exp(G2 ) = e. Also see the proof of Theorem 4.10 and Theorem\n4.11. In Section 5, some remarks about the unramified Brauer groups for Frobenius\ngroups will be given; here we don't assume the Frobenius kernels are abelian.\nAcknowledgments. I should like to thank I. M. Isaacs, E. Khukhro and Victor\nMazurov for providing many helpful messages about Frobenius groups.\nStanding notations. In discussing retract rationality, we always assume that the\nground field is infinite (see Definition 1.1). For emphasis, recall k(G) = k(xg : g \u2208 G)G ,\nwhich is defined in the first paragraph of this section.\nWe denote by \u03b6n a primitive n-th root of unity in some extension field of the ground\nfield k. When we write \u03b6n \u2208 k or char k \u2224 n, it is understood that either char k = 0 or\nchar k = p > 0 with p \u2224 n.\nAll the groups in this paper are finite groups. Cn denotes the cyclic group of order\nn. The exponent of a group G, exp(G), is defined as exp(G) = lcm{ord(g) : g \u2208 G}.\nWe denote p the finite field with p elements.\n\nF\n\n5\n\n\f\u00a72.\n\nStructure theorems of Frobenius groups\n\nWe recall some standard results of Frobenius groups in this section.\nTheorem 2.1 ([Is, Lemma 6.1 and Theorem 6.3]) Let G = N \u22ca G0 be a Frobenius\ngroup with kernel N and complement G0 .

By the same method as in Case 1, we embed the\nG2 -field k(x1 , x2 , x3 , x4 ) into the G2 -field k(xg : g \u2208 G2 ) and apply Theorem 3.5. We\nfind that k(G2 ) is rational over k(x1 , x2 , x3 , x4 )G2 .\nStep 2. Define y1 = x1 /x2 , y2 = x3 /x4 . Then k(x1 , x2 , x3 , x4 ) = k(y1 , y2 , x2 , x4 )\nand, for all g \u2208 G2 , g(y1), g(y2) \u2208 k(y1 , y2 ), g(x2 ) = \u03b1g x2 , g(x4 ) = \u03b2g x4 for some\n\u03b1g , \u03b2g \u2208 k(y1 , y2 ). Applying Theorem 3.4 twice, we find that k(y1 , y2, x2 , x4 )G2 =\nk(y1 , y2)G2 (v1 , v2 ) for some elements\nv1 , v2 fixed \u221a\nby G2 .\n\u221a\n\u221a\nNote\u221athat \u03c4 (x1 ) = [(\u22121\u2212 \u22121)x1 /2]+[(\u22121+ \u22121)x2 /2], \u03c4 (x2 ) = [(1+ \u22121)x1 /2]+\n[(\u22121 + \u22121)x2 /2], etc. Thus the action of G2 on k(y1 , y2) is given by\n\u03bb : y1 7\u2192 \u2212y1 , y2 7\u2192 y2 ,\n\u03c1 : y1 7\u2192 \u22121/y1 , y2 7\u2192 y2 ,\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u03c4 : y1 7\u2192 (\u2212y1 + \u22121)/(y1 + \u22121), y2 7\u2192 \u03b6 2y2 ,\n\u03bd : y1 7\u2192 (y1 + 1)/(y1 \u2212 1), y2 7\u2192 1/y2.\nDefine y3 = y12 + (1/y12).

Note that, for a k-automorphism \u03c3 on k(x) with \u03c3(x) = (ax + b)/(cx + d)\nwhere a, b, c, d \u2208 k and ad \u2212 bc 6= 0, if y = (\u03b1x + \u03b2)/(\u03b3x + \u03b4) with \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3, \u03b4 \u2208 k and\n\u03b1\u03b4 \u2212 \u03b2\u03b3 6= 0, then \u03c3(y) = (Ay + B)/(Cy + D) where A, B, C, D are defined by\n\u0013\n\u0013 \u0012\n\u0013\u0012\n\u0012\nA B\na b\n\u03b1 \u03b2\n.\n=\nC D\nc d\n\u03b3 \u03b4\nIn particular, if\n\u0012\n\u0013\u0012\n\u0013\u0012\n\u0013\u22121 \u0012\n\u0013\n\u03b1 \u03b2\na b\n\u03b1 \u03b2\ntw 0\n=\n\u03b3 \u03b4\nc d\n\u03b3 \u03b4\n0 t\nwhere ad \u2212 bc 6= 0, \u03b1\u03b4 \u2212 \u03b2\u03b3 6= 0 and \u03c3(x) = (ax + b)/(cx + d), then \u03c3(y) = wy if y is\ndefined as y = (\u03b1x + \u03b2)/(\u03b3x + \u03b4).\nStep 4. Return to the actions of \u03c4 and \u03bd on y3 . Since \u03c4 3 (y3 ) = 1, it follows that the\norder of the matrix ( 12 \u221212\n2 ) \u2208 P GL2 (k) is 3. Regard this matrix\u221aas a 2 \u00d7 2 matrix\n\u221a over\n2\nk. Its characteristic polynomial is (X \u2212 2) + 12 = (X \u2212 2 \u2212 2 \u221a\u22123)(X \u2212 2 + 2 \u22123).\nSince \u03b63 \u2208 k (because \u03b63l \u2208 k), it follows the eigenvalues 2 \u00b1 \u22123 \u2208 k. Hence this\nmatrix\n\u0001 can be diagonalized over k. In other words, there is an invertible 2 \u00d7 2 matrix\n\u03b1 \u03b2\n\u03b3 \u03b4 \u2208 GL2 (k) such that\n\u0012\n\u0013\u0012\n\u0013\u0012\n\u0013\u22121 \u0012\n\u0013\n\u03b1 \u03b2\n2 \u221212\n\u03b1 \u03b2\na 0\n=\n.\n\u03b3 \u03b4\n1 2\n\u03b3 \u03b4\n0 b\nSince the order of ( 21 \u221212\n2 ) \u2208 P GL2 (k) is 3, it is necessary that a/b = \u03c9 is a primitive\n3rd root of unity (where \u03c9 \u2032 = \u03c9 or \u03c9 2 ).\nApply the result of Step 3. Define y5 = (\u03b1y3 + \u03b2)/(\u03b3y3 + \u03b4). Then \u03c4 (y5 ) = \u03c9y5.\nNote that \u03bd(y5 ) = (Ay5 + B)/(Cy5 + D) for some A, B, C, D \u2208 k with AD \u2212 BC 6= 0.\nBecause \u03bd\u03c4 \u03bd \u22121 = \u03c4 \u22121 , we find \u03c4 \u03bd\u03c4 = \u03bd and \u03c4 \u03bd\u03c4 (y5 ) = \u03bd(y5 ). Plugging in the\nformula \u03bd(y5 ) = (Ay5 + B)/(Cy5 + D), we get the identity\n(\u03c9 2 Ay5 + \u03c9B)/(\u03c9Cy5 + D) = (Ay5 + B)/(Cy5 + D).\nThe above identity implies that A = D = 0. In other words, \u03bd(y5 ) = d/y5 for some\nd \u2208 k\\{0}.\nIn summary, we have k(y3 , y4 ) = k(y4 , y5 ) and\n\u03c4 : y4 \u2192\n7 \u03c9 \u2032y4 , y5 7\u2192 \u03c9y5 ,\n\u03bd : y4 \u2192\n7 1/y4, y5 \u2192\n7 d/y5 .\nBy Theorem 3.8, k(y4 , y5 )h\u03c4,\u03bdi is k-rational.

We will study the automorphism \u03b8 : SL2 (\nTheorem 2.8. Choose \u03c9 = 2 \u2208 5 .

Now we turn to the group G+ = h\u03bb, Li of this theorem.\nBecause L \u2243 SL2 ( 5 ) \u2243 H, we may use the presentation of H in Step 2 for a\npresentation of L, i.e. we write L = ha, b, ci with the relations given there. It follows\nthat \u03b8(a) = \u03b5a3 ca, \u03b8(b) = \u03b5c, \u03b8(c) = \u03b5b by Step 4. Define a group G\u2212 by 1 \u2192 {1, \u03b5} \u2192\nG+ \u2192 G\u2212 \u2192 1.

Since \u03bb \u2208 G+\nis mapped to (3 4) \u2208 S5 and \u03bb is an element of order 4, it follows that G+ \u2243 Sb5 by\nDefinition 4.8.\n\u0004\n16\n\n\fF\n\nTheorem 4.10 Let G = G1 \u00d7G2 be a GZ-group where G1 is a Z-group, G2 \u2243 SL2 ( 5 ),\ni.e. G is the group (I) in Theorem 2.8 with p = 5.\nAssume that k is a field satisfying at least one of the following conditions : char k =\n0, char k = 2, or char k = l > 0 with l \u2261 \u00b11 (mod 5). Then k(G2 ) is k-rational. If it\nis assumed furthermore that k is an infinite field, then k(G) is retract k-rational.\nProof.

We get k(x1 , x2 ) = k(x, x2 ). The\nproof is similar to the last paragraph of Case 1 in the proof of Theorem 4.4. We get\nk(x1 , x2 )A5 = k(x, x2 )A5 is k-rational.\nNow consider k(G). Note that gcd{|G1 |, |G2|} = 1. Thus |G1 | is an odd integer.\nk(G1 ) is retract k-rational by Lemma 4.1 (with the aid of Theorem 2.4). Using the\nresult that k(G2 ) is k-rational, we conclude that k(G) is retract k-rational by Theorem\n3.3.\n\u0004\n\nTheorem 4.11 Let G be the group (II) in Theorem 2.8 with p = 5. Define a subgroup\nG+ of G by G+ = h\u03bb, Li. If k is a field with char k = 2 or char k = 0 such that k(\u03b68 )\nis a cyclic extension of k, then k(G+ ) is k-rational. If it is assumed furthermore that\nk is an infinite field, then k(G) is retract rational.\nProof. By Lemma 4.9, G+ \u2243 Sb5 . We will show that k(G+ ) is k-rational.\nIf char k = 0 and k(\u03b68 ) is cyclic over k, then k(G+ ) is k-rational by [KZ, Theorem\n1.4].\nIf char k = 2, consider the group extension 1 \u2192 {\u00b11} \u2192 Sb5 \u2243 G+ \u2192 S5 \u2192 1. By\nTheorem 3.6, k(Sb5 ) is rational over k(S5 ). But k(S5 ) is k-rational. Hence so is k(Sb5 ).\nNow we will show that k(G) is retract k-rational. The proof is similar to that of\nTheorem 4.5.\nDefine H1 = h\u03c3i, H2 = h\u03c4, \u03bb, Li. We obtain G \u2243 H1 \u22ca H2 . Since k(H1 ) is retract\nk-rational by Theorem 3.2, we find that k(G) is retract k-rational if and only if k(H2 )\nis retract k-rational by Theorem 3.1.\n\n17\n\n\fDefine H3 = h\u03c4 i and G+ = h\u03bb, Li. Then H2 \u2243 H3 \u22caG+ . Using the same arguments,\nwe find that k(H2 ) is retract k-rational if and only so is k(G+ ).\nUnder the assumption that (i) char k = 0 with k(\u03b68 ) cyclic over k, or (ii) char k = 2\nand k is infinite, it is clear that k(G+ ) is retract k-rational because it is k-rational. \u0004\nExample 4.12 Let G and G+ be the same as in Theorem 4.11, and k be a field with\nchar k = 0. Checking the proof of Theorem 4.11, we find that k(G) is retract k-rational\nif and only if so is k(G+ ).\nBy Serre's Theorem, (Sb5 ) is not retract -rational [GMS, Example 33.27, page\n90; KZ, Theorem 1.2].

If |N| is even\nand the exponent of N is 2u n\u2032 (where 2 \u2224 n\u2032 ), then the exponent of G is 2u m (where\n2 \u2224 m). Since \u03b62u\u2032 \u2208 k, it follows that k(N) is also retract k-rational by Theorem 3.2.\nApplying Theorem 3.1, we find the k(G) is retract k-rational.\n\u0004\nProof of Theorem 1.8.

In particular, if k is an\nalgebraically closed field and K is retract k-rational, then Brv,k (K) = 0. The following\nresult shows that Brv,k (k(G)) depends only on the group G.\nTheorem 5.1 (Bogomolov, Saltman [Bo; Sa4, Theorem 12]) Let G be a finite group,\nk be an algebraically closed field with gcd{|G|, char k} = 1.

It is shown in the proof of [Mo, Corollary 6.6] that\nres : B0 (G) \u2192 B0 (N) is injective. Since B0 (N) \u2192 \u2295p B0 (Np ) is also injective where p\nruns over all the prime divisors of |N|, thus B0 (G) \u2192 \u2295p B0 (Np ) is injective.
