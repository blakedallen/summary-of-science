There, it was conjectured to be an exact symmetry at tree level, but broken by quantum corrections,\nand an expression for the anomaly associated to the dual conformal generators was\nproposed. A confirmation of the conjecture was presented shortly after in [2], where\nit was demonstrated that the tree-level S-matrix of N = 4 SYM transforms covariantly under the dual superconformal group. Furthermore, it was shown in the same\npaper that the supercoefficients, which appear in the expansion of planar, one-loop\namplitudes in a basis of box functions, transform covariantly under the symmetry,\ni.e. exactly in the same way as superamplitudes.\nDual conformal symmetry was first observed in the context of the duality between\nMHV scattering amplitudes and Wilson loops [3\u20135]. Strong indications of this duality\nwere discovered in string theory in [3], where the calculation of scattering amplitudes\nat strong coupling was mapped to that of a Wilson loop with a particular polygonal\ncontour which can be constructed by gluing together the null momenta of the scattered\nparticles, following the order of the insertions of the string vertex operators on the\nworldsheet. Quite surprisingly, several calculations in perturbative N = 4 SYM, first\nat one [4, 5] and then at two loops [6\u20139], showed that the same duality holds also\nat weak coupling, with perfect agreement found between the perturbative Wilson\nloop and the MHV scattering amplitudes of the N = 4 theory computed in [10\u201313].\nThe perturbative Wilson loop/amplitude duality was recently studied in [14], where a\nnumerical calculation of Wilson loops at two loops for an arbitrary number of particles\nwas presented.\nAt strong coupling, the emergence of dual superconformal symmetry was understood in [15, 16] using a peculiar T-duality of the superstring theory on AdS5 \u00d7 S 5 ,\nwhich combines bosonic [3] and fermionic T-duality transformations. The combined\neffect of these T-dualities maps the original string sigma model into a dual sigma\nmodel identical to the original one. More importantly, the T-duality also exchanges\nthe original with the dual superconformal symmetries.\nAt weak coupling, dual conformal symmetry emerged as the ordinary conformal\nsymmetry of the Wilson loop, which acts in the conventional way on 't Hooft's region\nmomenta xi . These are defined via the relations pi,\u03b1\u03b1\u0307 = (xi \u2212 xi+1 )\u03b1\u03b1\u0307 , where i =\n1, . . . , n, n is the number of scattered particles, and the identification xn+1 = x1\nenforces momentum conservation. Dual conformal symmetry is broken by loop effects\nand the corresponding anomalous Ward identity for the Wilson loop was derived\nin [6, 7]. In particular, it was shown in [7] that the ABDK/BDS ansatz [13, 17] for\nthe all-loop MHV amplitudes in N = 4 SYM is a solution to this anomalous Ward\n1\n\n\fidentity.\nThe origin of the dual conformal anomaly at the quantum level can be traced to the\npresence of cusps in the polygonal contour of the Wilson loop. For a smooth contour\ndual conformal transformations would be an exact symmetry, however the cusps give\nrise to short-distance singularities which need to be regularised, and, hence, generate\nan anomaly in the dual conformal transformations at the loop level. These ultraviolet\ndivergences are mapped to the conventional infrared divergences of the scattering\namplitudes [18\u201325], thus suggesting an intimate link between infrared singularities\nand the dual conformal anomaly.\nInspired by the anomaly derived from the Wilson loop side and the duality with\nMHV amplitudes, dual conformal symmetry was extended in [1] to dual superconformal symmetry, acting on superamplitudes [26] defined in a dual on-shell superspace.\nMoreover, it was suggested that any superamplitude factorises naturally into the MHV\nsuperamplitude and a dual superconformal invariant factor R as A = AMHV R. The\nMHV superamplitude factor completely encapsulates the anomaly, which is therefore\na universal quantity. This remarkable conjecture was checked at one loop in [27]\nfor the next-to-MHV (NMHV) superamplitudes up to nine particles. Very recently\nin [28,29] dual conformal covariance was proved for one-loop NMHV superamplitudes\nwith an arbitrary number of external particles.\nThe goal of this paper is to prove the dual conformal anomaly for generic (nonMHV) one-loop superamplitudes in the N = 4 theory. In order to do so, we will\nbuild on the results of [28], where the most generic expression for the dual conformal\nanomaly of all N = 4 superamplitudes was derived using only the result that the\nsuperamplitude can be expanded in terms of box functions [10]. The result of that\ncalculation, reviewed in Section 2, was found to be the sum of two terms. The first\none is precisely the one-loop anomaly conjectured in [1]. Therefore, the additional\nterm must vanish if the conjecture of [1] is correct. This indeed happens for all MHV\nand NMHV superamplitudes, as was proved in [28] by using the explicit forms of\nthese amplitudes derived in [10] and in [27]. Moreover, a new set of equations for the\none-loop supercoefficients of a generic non-MHV amplitude were derived in [28] by\nassuming the vanishing of this additional term. In this paper we will prove that this\nterm does indeed vanish for generic superamplitudes, thus providing a proof of the\ndual conformal anomaly conjectured in [1] at the one-loop level and, consequently, of\nthe conformal equations presented in [28].\nAs will be explained in Section 2, this additional term is finite in four dimensions\nand can be written as a particular linear combination of two-mass triangle functions,\nwhich depend on multi-particle as well as two-particle invariants. On the other hand,\nthe dual conformal anomaly of [1] diverges as 1/\u01eb as \u01eb \u2192 0, and depends only on\ntwo-particle invariants through one-mass triangles. Note that we work here in di2\n\n\fmensional regularisation with D = 4 \u2212 2\u01eb. The different analytical structures of the\ntwo terms in the anomaly suggest that it is sufficient to study the discontinuities of\nthe anomaly in all possible kinematic channels in order to prove that the additional\nterm in the anomaly is in fact absent. Importantly, these discontinuities can be expressed in terms of appropriate phase space integrals. In Section 3 we will begin by\ncalculating two-particle cuts of the one-loop anomaly for a generic superamplitude\nwhich are associated to discontinuities in multi-particle channels.1 We will find that\nfor any superamplitude these multi-particle discontinuities give rise to finite phase\nspace integrals multiplied by \u01eb. Hence, all the multi-particle discontinuities of the\ndual conformal variation of a superamplitude vanish in four dimensions. With this\nresult we can rule out any additional terms to the anomaly conjectured in [1]. We\nemphasise that our proof is general and applies to superamplitudes with arbitrary\ntotal helicity and an arbitrary number of external particles.\nWe have mentioned earlier a potential link between the dual conformal anomaly\nand infrared divergences. In Section 4 we expose this connection further by considering two-particle cuts of the anomaly in two-particle channels. Unlike the multi-particle\ndiscontinuities discussed above, the two-particle discontinuities of the anomaly are\nnon-zero and finite in four dimensions. By uplifting the cut to a full loop diagram,\nakin to a procedure introduced in [31] for the calculation of splitting amplitudes, we\ncalculate its leading infrared divergence, which in this case is of the order 1/\u01eb. This\nturns out to reproduce precisely the anomaly of [1].\nOur treatment of the two-particle channels exposes the leading 1/\u01eb2 infrared singularity in this uplifted one-loop integral (which is further multiplied by one power\nof \u01eb from an anomalous Jacobian), and in principle could miss subleading 1/\u01eb contributions to it; these, in turn, would lead to finite, unwanted contributions to the\nanomaly. However, we will argue that, thanks to the no-triangle and bubble property\nof one-loop amplitudes in N = 4 SYM [10], our approximation in fact captures all\nthe infrared divergences of the above mentioned loop integral. This result, together\nwith the absence of discontinuities of the anomaly in multi-particle channels, will provide us with a second (albeit intimately related) proof of the dual conformal anomaly\nconjectured in [1].\nThis second proof has the virtue of making more manifest the connection of the\ndual conformal anomaly of a generic scattering amplitude to its infrared divergences.\nWe stress that a crucial ingredient of both proofs is the maximal supersymmetry\nof the theory. In the second proof, this enters directly through the no-triangle and\nbubble property of the N = 4 amplitudes [10]; in the first proof, it enters through\nthe specific form of the most general anomaly, derived in [28].2\n1\n\nThis has been done in the recent paper [30] for MHV amplitudes.\nThis form of the anomaly can itself be thought of as a non-trivial consequence of the no triangle\nand bubble property.\n2\n\n3\n\n\f2\n\nBackground\n\nIn this section we will first describe the structure of one-loop superamplitudes, and\nwill then discuss the general form of the dual conformal anomaly.\n\n2.1\n\nOne-loop superamplitudes\n\nScattering amplitudes in N = 4 SYM with a fixed number of particles and total\nhelicity are naturally combined into superamplitudes [26]. These are defined in an\non-shell superspace where to each particle i one associates the momentum pi = \u03bbi \u03bb\u0303i ,\nas well as a fermionic variables \u03b7iA , where A = 1, . . . , 4 is an SU(4) index. The\nsuperamplitude can then be expanded in powers of the \u03b7iA 's, and each term of this\nexpansion corresponds\nto a particular amplitude in N = 4 SYM with a fixed total\nPn\nhelicity htot = i=1 hi . A term containing mi powers of \u03b7i corresponds to a scattering\nprocess where the ith particle has helicity hi = 1 \u2212 mi /2. For instance, the MHV\nsuperamplitude is given by the following compact expression\nAMHV = i (2\u03c0)4\n\n\u03b4 (4) (P ) \u03b4 (8) (\u039b)\n,\nh12ih23i * * * hn1i\n\n(2.1)\n\nP\nP\nwhere P := ni=1 \u03bbi \u03bb\u0303i and \u039b := ni=1 \u03b7i \u03bbi are the total momentum and supermomentum, respectively.\nOne-loop amplitudes in the maximally supersymmetric N = 4 theory can be\nexpanded in a known basis of integrals which contains only box functions3 Fi , and\nno triangle or bubble functions [10]. The functions Fi are related to the scalar box\nintegrals Ii by a kinematic prefactor as follows. We call K1 , K2 , K3 and K4 the\nexternal momenta at the four corners of a given box function, which are expressed as\nsums of momenta pi of external particles. The momenta K1...4 can also be written in\nterms of the region momenta x1...4 , e.g. K1 = x12 , where xij := xi \u2212 xj (see Figure\n1). Then, up to a numerical constant, the relation between the F 's and the I's is\nFi\nIi = \u22122 \u221a ,\nRi\n2 2 2\nRi = (x13 x24 ) \u2212 2x213 x224 x212 x234 \u2212 2x213 x224 x223 x241 + (x212 x234 \u2212 x223 x241 )2 .

In order to deal with quantities which are invariant under dual\nconformal transformations rather than covariant, it is convenient to redefine the dual\nconformal generator K \u03bc as [32]\nK\n\n\u03bc\n\n\u2192 K\u0302\n\n\u03bc\n\n\u03bc\n\n:= K \u2212 2\n\nn\nX\n\nx\u03bci .\n\n(2.6)\n\ni=1\n\nThe covariance of the one-loop supercoefficients is then re-expressed as\nK\u0302 \u03bc c(i, j, k, l) = 0 .\n\n5\n\n(2.7)\n\n\f2.2\n\nThe structure of the anomaly\n\nDual conformal symmetry is violated at the quantum level by the presence of infrared\ndivergences.

In order to set the\nscene for our proof, let us now highlight the main characteristics of (2.9).\nTo begin with, the first term of (2.9) precisely matches the anomaly conjectured\nin [1]. Furthermore, it contains only one-mass triangles whose arguments are twoparticle invariants. These triangles, multiplied by \u01eb, give rise to terms which diverge\nas 1/\u01eb as \u01eb \u2192 0.\n6\n\n\fOn the other hand, the second line of (2.9) contains two-mass triangles whose\narguments can be two- or multi-particle invariants. In general, there is no two-mass\ntriangle that has only two-particle invariants, except at five points, where amplitudes\nare only MHV or anti-MHV. This specific case has already been addressed explicitly\nin [1, 28] where it was shown that the anomaly of [1] is correctly reproduced.\nThe presence of multi-particle invariants in the second line of (2.9) is its key signature, and in the next section we will use the analyticity properties of this expression\nto prove that, in fact, this term identically vanishes. As a byproduct, this implies the\nconformal equations\nE(i, k) = 0 ,\n\ni = 1, . . . , n , k = i + 2, . . . , i + n \u2212 3 ,\n\n(2.13)\n\nrelating box coefficients, where E(i, k) are given in (2.10). These relations were conjectured in [28] to hold for any superamplitude, and checked explicitly for the infinite\nsequences of MHV and NMHV superamplitudes. They can be solved to give expressions for all one-mass, two-mass easy and half of the two-mass hard box coefficients\nin terms of the remaining box coefficients.\n\n3\n\nThe first proof\n\nWe perform the proof of the one loop dual conformal anomaly in two steps:\n1. We will calculate the discontinuities of the anomaly using conventional unitarity\n[33], and prove that for multi-particle channels, the result for the discontinuity is\ngiven by \u01eb times an integral which is finite in four dimensions. The result for such a\ndiscontinuity therefore vanishes in four dimensions.\n2. We will calculate the discontinuity of the anomaly in a multi-particle channel\ndirectly from (2.9), and impose that this vanishes. This precisely implies the dual\nconformal equations (2.13) and therefore proves the form of the anomaly conjectured\nin [1] for all one-loop superamplitudes in the N =4 theory,\nK\u0302\n\n\u03bc\n\nA1\u2212loop\nn\n\n=\n\n4\u01eb Atree\nn\n\nn\nX\n\nx\u03bci\u22121 x2ii\u22122 J(x2ii\u22122 ) .\n\n(3.1)\n\ni=1\n\nWe now proceed directly to the proof.\n1. Consider the discontinuity of the superamplitude in a certain multi-particle\nchannel PL2 . We wish to show that this is conformally invariant (this is not true\n7\n\n\ffor the two-particle channel \u2013 such cuts will be considered in the following section).\nThe corresponding cut diagram is represented in Figure 2, and is expressed by the\nfollowing phase space integral:\nZ\nd\u03bci,...,j AL (l2 , l1 , i, . . . , j) AR(\u2212l1 , \u2212l2 , j + 1, . . . , i \u2212 1) .\n(3.2)\nThe integration measure is defined as\nd\u03bci,...,j := dLIPS(l2 , l1 ; PL ) d4 \u03b7l1 d4 \u03b7l2 \u03b4 (8) (\u03b7l1 \u03bbl1 + \u03b7l2 \u03bbl2 + \u039bL ) ,\n\n(3.3)\n\ndLIPS(l2 , l1 ; PL ) = dD l1 dD l2 \u03b4 (+) (l12 ) \u03b4 (+) (l22 ) \u03b4 (D) (l1 + l2 + PL ) ,\n\n(3.4)\n\nwhere\nis the phase space measure, and d4 \u03b7l1 d4 \u03b7l2 \u03b4 (8) (\u03b7l1 \u03bbl1 + \u03b7l2 \u03bbl2 + \u039bL ) is the fermionic\nintegration measure.

In (3.2) we are omitting overall delta functions imposing momentum\nand supermomentum conservation.\nIn the appendix we compute the dual conformal transformation of the discontinuity in the x2i j+1 channel, with the result\nZ\ni\n\u0002 \u03bc 1\u2212loop \u0003\n\u0001 (+)\n\u0001h \u03bc\n4\nD\n(+)\n2\n2\ny hl1 l2 i AL AR .\n= 2(4\u2212D) d y \u03b4\n(y\u2212xi ) \u03b4\n(xj+1 \u2212y)\ndiscx2i j+1 K\u0302 An\n(3.6)\n\nFigure 2: A cut diagram reproducing the discontinuity of the anomaly for a generic\nsuperamplitude in a kinematic channel x2i j+1. When x2i j+1 is a multi-particle invariant, the phase space integral corresponding to this cut diagram is finite, and vanishes\nin four dimensions due to the factor of D \u2212 4 on the right hand side of (3.6).\nIn order to understand whether (3.6) leads to a contribution to the anomaly, we\nanalyse the singularities of the integral in that equation. To this end, we first consider\n8\n\n\fthe phase space integral giving the discontinuity of the superamplitude in the same\nchannel x2i j+1 . This is given by\nZ\ni\n\u0001 (+)\n\u0001h\n4\n1\u2212loop\nD\n(+)\n2\n2\nhl1 l2 i AL AR . (3.7)\ndiscx2i j+1 An\n= d y\u03b4\n(y \u2212 xi ) \u03b4\n(xj+1 \u2212 y)\nAs is well known, there is a crucial distinction in the infrared properties of (3.7)\nbetween the cases when the channel is a multi-particle or a two-particle one. When\nx2i j+1 is a multi-particle channel, the integral appearing on the right hand side of\n(3.7) is free of infrared divergences and hence can be calculated in four dimensions,\nsee [34] and [31] for a discussion of this point.4 This is of course in agreement with\nthe general expression of the infrared divergences of one-loop amplitudes in N = 4\nSYM, given by [35]\nA1\u2212loop\n|IR = \u2212r\u0393 Atree\nn\nn\n\nn\nX\n(\u2212x2ii+2 )\u2212\u01eb\ni=1\n\n\u01eb2\n\n,\n\n(3.8)\n\nwhich only contain two-particle invariants formed with adjacent momenta (but no\nmulti-particle invariant).\nWe now make the observation that the integral we are really interested in, namely\nthat on the right hand side of (3.6) is very similar to the integral appearing in (3.7).\nMore precisely, (3.6) contains an extra power of 2(D \u2212 4) and a y \u03bc in the integrand\ncompared to (3.7). The presence in (3.6) of y = xj+1 \u2212 l1 by itself cannot lead to\nany infrared singularity (the term containing l1 will only give rise to terms which are\nbetter behaved in the infrared). Since (3.7) is infrared finite, we conclude that the\npresence of a factor of D \u2212 4 multiplying the discontinuity of the anomaly (3.6) will\nmake the result vanish. Hence, for a generic multi-particle channel x2i j+1 ,\n\u0002\n\u0003\n= 0,\ndiscx2i j+1 K\u0302 \u03bc A1\u2212loop\nn\n\nj 6= i + 1 .\n\n(3.9)\n\nThis concludes the first part of the proof. Notice that (3.9) is in agreement with [30],\nwhere it was observed that the discontinuities of the one-loop MHV amplitude in\nmulti-particle channels, calculated in [34], are dual conformal invariant. Our result\n(3.9) is however completely general, in that it applies to all one-loop amplitudes,\nincluding non-MHV.\n2. We now wish to use the absence of conformal anomalies in the multi-particle\ncut (3.9) to constrain the expression (2.9). More precisely, we will use the fact that\nin each of the n(n \u2212 5)/2 multi-particle channels the discontinuity of the anomaly\n4\n\nFor the sake of this first proof, we are only interested in multi-particle channels, as discussed\nabove. We will later on discuss the two-particle channel discontinuities, to show how the anomaly\narises precisely from such singular channels.\n\n9\n\n\fvanishes in order to prove the conformal equations (2.13), and hence the form of the\nconformal anomaly for generic amplitudes.\nTo this end, we focus on the terms on the right hand side of (2.9) which have a\ndiscontinuity in a certain multi-particle channel x2ik . There are four such terms:\nh\ni\n\u03bc\n\u03bc 2\n2\n2\n2\nK\u0302 \u03bc A1\u2212loop\n\u220b\n\u22122\u01eb\nE(i,\nk)\nx\nx\n\u2212\nx\nx\nn\ni\u22121 ik\ni i\u22121 k J(xik , xi\u22121 k )\ni\nh\n\u2212 2\u01eb E(i + 1, k) x\u03bci x2i+1 k \u2212 x\u03bci+1 x2ik J(x2i+1 k , x2ik )\nh\ni\n\u03bc\n\u03bc 2\n2\n\u2212 2\u01eb E(k, i) xk\u22121 xik \u2212 xk xk\u22121 i J(x2ik , x2k\u22121 i )\n(3.10)\ni\nh\n\u2212 2\u01eb E(k + 1, i) x\u03bck x2k+1 i \u2212 x\u03bck+1 x2ik J(x2k+1 i , x2ik ) .\nThe last two lines are obtained from the first two by simply exchanging i with k. The\ndiscontinuity of a triangle function is given by\n\u0002\n\u0003\ndiscb \u01eb J(a, b) =\n\n2\u03c0i\n+ O(\u01eb) ,\nb\u2212a\n\n(3.11)\n\ntherefore\n\u0002\n\u0003\ndiscx2ik K \u03bc An1\u2212loop\nh\nx\u03bci x2i+1 k \u2212 x\u03bci+1 x2ik\nx\u03bci\u22121 x2ik \u2212 x\u03bci x2i\u22121 k\n+ E(i + 1, k)\n= 2\u03c0i E(i, k)\nx2ik \u2212 x2i\u22121 k\nx2ik \u2212 x2i+1 k\nx\u03bc x2 \u2212 x\u03bck x2k\u22121 i\nx\u03bck x2k+1 i \u2212 x\u03bck+1 x2ik i\nE(k, i) k\u22121 2ik\n+\nE(k\n+\n1,\ni)\nxik \u2212 x2k\u22121 i\nx2ik \u2212 x2k+1 i\n= 0,\n(3.12)\nwhere in the last step we have used (3.9).\nEquation (3.12) is a vector equation, which we can rewrite as\n\u03bc\n\u03bc\n\u03bc\n\u03bc\nE(i, k)vik\n+ E(i + 1, k)vi+1k\n+ E(k, i)vki\n+ E(k + 1, i)vk+1i\n= 0,\n\nwhere\n\u03bc\nvik\n:=\n\nx\u03bci\u22121 x2ik \u2212 x\u03bci x2i\u22121 k\n,\nx2ik \u2212 x2i\u22121 k\n\n(3.13)\n\n(3.14)\n\n\u03bc\n\u03bc\n\u03bc\n\u03bc\nand we remark that the four vectors vik\n, vi\u22121k\n, vki\nand vk\u22121i\nare in general linearly\nindependent in four dimensions. Hence we conclude that the coefficients E(i, k),\nE(k, i), E(i + 1, k), E(k + 1, i) must vanish independently.\n\nThis proves the conformal equations (2.13), and therefore we conclude that the\ndual conformal anomaly for an arbitrary (non-MHV) amplitude is given by (3.1).\n10\n\n\fThis completes our proof. We conclude this section with a couple of additional\ncomments.\nFirst, we have managed to prove n(n \u2212 4) conformal equations E(i, k)=0 in (2.13)\nfrom considering just n(n \u2212 5)/2 multi-particle cuts of the amplitude. We can do\nthis since each multiparticle cut anomaly is a vectorial equation and hence gives four\nindependent conditions, thus we really obtain 2n(n\u22125) (dependent) conditions. These\nare precisely the conditions (3.13). Each multiparticle cut x2ik leads to the condition\nE(i, k) = 0 and E(k, i) = 0. This leaves only the 'boundary case' E(i, i + 2) = 0\npotentially unaccounted for. Fortunately (3.13) also gives E(i + 1, k) = 0 which for\nk = i + 3 gives us precisely this boundary case with the (arbitrary) label i shifted to\ni + 1.\nSecond, we mention an important point which could have affected our proof. It has\nbeen recently pointed out in [30, 36] that some of the dual superconformal generators\ndo not precisely annihilate the superamplitude but leave behind a delta-function\nsupported contribution of the type of an holomorphic anomaly [37]. It is important\nfor our proof that there is no holomorphic anomaly for the special conformal generator\nK \u03bc we are interested in. Indeed, had K \u03bc acting on the tree-level amplitudes AL or AR\nin (3.7) produced delta-function contributions, the phase space integration in (3.7)\nwould be localised, and new, unwanted contributions to the dual conformal anomaly\nwould be generated.\nFortunately, the absence of holomorphic anomaly contributions to the dual special conformal generator K \u03bc has been shown for all tree-level amplitudes in [36], and\nspecifically for MHV superamplitudes and six-point NMHV tree-level superamplitudes in [30]. We recall that the holomorphic anomaly arises from\n\u2202\n1\n= 2\u03c0 \u03bc\u0303\u03b1\u0307 \u03b4(h\u03bb\u03bci) \u03b4([\u03bb\u0303\u03bc\u0303]) .\n\u2202 \u03bb\u0303\u03b1\u0307 h\u03bb\u03bci\n\n(3.15)\n\nIn order to get a contribution from holomorphic anomalies which would lead to a\nlocalisation of the phase space integral in (3.7), one should then identify all possible\nphysical singularities in the scattering amplitude of the type 1/hlki, where l is any one\nof the cut loop momenta, and k one of the legs which are adjacent to it.5 At tree level,\nsuch singularities arise only from collinear kinematics, and in [30] it has been shown\nthat in the action of K\u03b1\u03b1\u0307 on 1/hii+1i, the holomorphic anomaly contributions cancel.\nTherefore, the special conformal generator is not affected by holomorphic anomalies.6\n5\nWe consider colour-ordered amplitudes, hence such singularities can only involve particles that\nare adjacent in colour space.\n6\nUnlike the dual special conformal generator, the dual supersymmetry generator Q\u0304 does suffer\nfrom a holomorphic anomaly [30].\n\n11\n\n\f4\n\nUnearthing the anomaly with two-particle cuts\n\nTo complete our discussion, we now address the two-particle channel cuts of the conformal variation of the amplitudes in more detail. This will reveal the close relation\nbetween infrared divergences of the amplitude and the dual conformal anomaly. For\n\nFigure 3: The cut diagram reproducing the discontinuity of the anomaly for a generic\nsuperamplitude in the two-particle channel sii+1 = x2ii+2 . In this case the superamplitude on the left hand side has four particles and, hence, must be a MHV superamplitude. This diagram has an infrared divergence arising from the region of integration\nwhere l1 \u223c \u2212pi and l2 \u223c \u2212pi+1 . In this region we also have that y \u223c xi+1 where y is\nthe region momentum between the two cut legs.\nconcreteness let us consider the two-particle channel cut of a generic one-loop amplitude represented in Figure 3. This cut gives rise to the following phase space\nintegral,\nZ\n1\u2212loop\n=\nd\u03bcii+1 AMHV (i, i + 1, l2 , l1 ) AR (\u2212l1 , \u2212l2 , i + 2, . . . , i \u2212 1) , (4.1)\ndiscx2ii+2 An\nwhile the corresponding cut diagram of the dual conformal anomaly is given by\nZ\nh\ni\n\u0002 \u03bc 1\u2212loop \u0003\n= 4\u01eb d\u03bcii+1 y \u03bc AMHV (i, i+1, l2 , l1 ) AR (\u2212l1 , \u2212l2 , i+2, . . . , i\u22121) ,\ndiscx2i i+2 K An\n(4.2)\nwhere the integration measure appearing in both expressions is defined in (3.3).\n\nThe phase space integrals appearing in (4.1) and (4.2) are both infrared divergent.\nThe divergence arises from a region where l1 becomes collinear to pi and l2 becomes\ncollinear to pi+1 at the same time [31]. This occurrence of simultaneous collinear\nsingularities is special to two-particle cuts and is necessary to produce the expected\ninfrared divergences. For generic kinematics, i.e. if pi and pi+1 are not collinear,\nmomentum conservation of the four-point MHV amplitude implies that the singular\nregion of the momentum integral is confined to\nl1 \u2192 \u2212pi ,\n\nl2 \u2192 \u2212pi+1 .\n12\n\n(4.3)\n\n\fIn this singular region of loop momentum space, the region momentum y localises on\nthe region momentum xi+1 , which will be of importance in the following.\nIn the following we will show that the exact one-loop anomaly and the infrared\ndivergent part of the amplitude can be extracted by using an approximation which\nfocuses exactly on this peculiar loop momentum region. A couple of explanations are\nin order here:\n\u2022 We observe that the leading infrared singularity of both integrals is correctly\ncaptured by replacing \u2212l1 and \u2212l2 in the tree-level superamplitude AR by pi\nand pi+1 , respectively. Importantly, this allows us to pull AR out in front of\nthe integrals (4.1) and (4.2). Note that this tree-level superamplitude has the\nsame total helicity as the one-loop amplitude under consideration. Furthermore,\nin the integrand of (4.2) we can replace y with xi+1 and factor it out of the\nintegral as well. This factorisation property of the leading infrared singularity\nis illustrated in Figure 4.\n\u2022 We know from (3.9) in the previous section that the anomaly does not have\ndiscontinuities in multi-particle channels and, hence, it can only depend on\ntwo-particle invariants.\n\u2022 Our approximation of the cut integrals (4.1) and (4.2) removes all dependence\non momentum invariants other than the two-particle invariant x2ii+2 . This allows\nus to directly uplift the cut integrals to full loop integrals, i.e. replace the two\non-shell \u03b4-functions in the cut by propagators, very much as was done in [31]\nfor splitting amplitudes.\n\u2022 The remaining issue is to rule out any subleading infrared terms that our approximation might miss. For the amplitudes, this is easily settled by recalling\nthat in N = 4 SYM all one-loop amplitudes are linear combinations of box\nfunctions and that all potentially infrared divergent terms are expressed in\nterms of one-mass triangle functions with a two-particle invariant argument,\nwhich behave as (\u2212x2ii+2 )\u2212\u01eb /\u01eb2 . Indeed, after uplifting the cut integral, one\nobtains one-mass triangle integrals with the expected coefficient. If we now\napply dual special conformal transformation on our integrand, one power of the\nloop momentum appears in the numerator. Uplifting then gives rise to linear\nbox functions, which can be reduced to scalar boxes and triangles. The result\nconsists of finite terms and terms that are of the form (\u2212s)\u2212\u01eb /\u01eb2 or (\u2212t)\u2212\u01eb /\u01eb2\nfor two- (multi-)particle invariants s (t). Crucially, there are no subleading 1/\u01eb\nterms, i.e. bubble functions. Since the dual conformal transformation comes\nwith a factor of \u01eb, only one-mass triangles with two-particle invariants survive.\nSo in essence the no-bubble and no-triangle property of one-loop amplitudes in\n\n13\n\n\fN = 4 SYM ensures that our procedure is valid.7\n\nFigure 4: Graphic representation of the factorised structure of the two-particle channel\ndiscontinuities of the amplitude and of the anomaly in (4.4) and (4.5).\nAfter these comments we proceed now to the explicit evaluation of the two-particle\ncut integrals (4.1) and (4.2).

We recall that momenta are written as differences\nof region momenta as\npi := xi \u2212 xi+1 ,\n(A.2)\nand that under an infinitesimal special conformal transformation one has\nK \u03bd x\u03bc := \u03b7 \u03bc\u03bd x2 \u2212 2 x\u03bc x\u03bd .\n15\n\n(A.3)\n\n\fIn spinor notation, (A.3) becomes\nK \u03b2 \u03b2\u0307 x\u03b1i \u03b1\u0307 = \u22122 x\u03b1i \u03b2\u0307 xi\u03b2 \u03b1\u0307 ,\n\n(A.4)\n\nand one can easily check that the transformations\n\nK \u03b2 \u03b2\u0307 \u03bb\u03b1i = \u22122 (x\u03b1i \u03b2\u0307 \u03bb\u03b2i \u2212 \u03bci \u03bb\u03b1i \u03bb\u03b2i \u03bb\u0303\u03b2\u0307i ) ,\n\n\u03b2\u0307\n\u03b1\u0307 \u03b2\u0307 \u03b2\nK \u03b2 \u03b2\u0307 \u03bb\u0303\u03b1\u0307i = \u22122 (x\u03b1\u0307\u03b2\ni \u03bb\u0303i \u2212 (1 \u2212 \u03bci )\u03bb\u0303i \u03bb\u0303i \u03bbi ) ,\n\n(A.5)\n(A.6)\n\n\u03b1\u0307\nare consistent with this (consider K \u03b2 \u03b2\u0307 (\u03bb\u03b1i \u03bb\u0303\u03b1\u0307i ) = K \u03b2 \u03b2\u0307 x\u03b1i i+1\n). The standard choice\nof spinor transformation [1] is obtained by simply setting \u03bci = 0. We will have\nto consider these general transformations involving the free parameter \u03bci in order\nto correctly cope with the transformation of the spinors associated with the loop\nmomenta.\n\nWe have\nK \u03bc x2ii+2 = \u22122(x\u03bci + x\u03bci+2 )x2ii+2 ,\n\nand\n\nh\ni\nK \u03bc hii + 1i = \u22122 x\u03bci (1 \u2212 \u03bci ) + x\u03bci+1 (\u03bci \u2212 \u03bci+1 ) + x\u03bci+2 \u03bci+1 hii + 1i ,\ni\nh\nK \u03bc [ii + 1] = \u22122 x\u03bci \u03bci + x\u03bci+1 (\u2212\u03bci + \u03bci+1 ) + x\u03bci+2 (1 \u2212 \u03bci+1 ) [ii + 1] .\n\n(A.7)\n(A.8)\n(A.9)\n\nAfter performing the fermionic integrations and one of the two momentum integrations, as well as a shift in the integration variable to y = l1 +xi , the cut superamplitude\nbecomes\nZ\ndD y \u03b4 (+) (l12 ) \u03b4 (+) (l22 ) hl1 l2 i4 AL AR ,\n(A.10)\nwhere l1 = \u03bbl1 \u03bb\u0303l1 = y \u2212 xi and l2 = \u03bbl2 \u03bb\u0303l2 = xj+1 \u2212 y.\nThe transformation of the various components of the cut diagram read as follows,\nKAL (l2 , l1 , i, . . . , j)\nj\nh X\n=2\nxa (1 \u2212 2\u03bca + 2\u03bca\u22121 ) + xj+1 (1 \u2212 2\u03bcl2 + 2\u03bcj )\na=i+1\n\ni\n+ y(1 \u2212 2\u03bcl1 + 2\u03bcl2 ) + xi (1 \u2212 2\u03bci + 2\u03bcl1 ) AL (l2 , l1 , i, . . . , j) ,\n\n(A.11)\n\nand\nKAR (\u2212l1 , \u2212l2 , j + 1, . . . , i \u2212 1)\ni\u22121\nh X\n=2\nxb (1 \u2212 2\u03bcb + 2\u03bcb\u22121 ) + xi (1 \u2212 2\u03bc\u2032l1 + 2\u03bci\u22121 )\nb=j+2\n\ni\n+ y(1 \u2212 2\u03bc\u2032l2 + 2\u03bc\u2032l1 ) + xj+1 (1 \u2212 2\u03bcj+1 + 2\u03bc\u2032l2 ) AR (\u2212l1 , \u2212l2 , j + 1, . . . , i \u2212 1) .\n\n(A.12)\n\n16\n\n\fFurthermore, one has\nK \u03b4 (+) (l12 ) = 2(xi + y) \u03b4 (+) (l12 ) ,\nK \u03b4 (+) (l22 ) = 2(xj+1 + y) \u03b4 (+)(l22 ) ,\nK dD y = \u22122D y dD y .\n\n(A.13)\n(A.14)\n(A.15)\n\nHere the \u03bc\u2032 parameters are defined as \u03bc\u2032l1 := 1 \u2212 \u03bcl1 and \u03bc\u2032l2 := 1 \u2212 \u03bcl2 , accounting\nfor the fact that, in AR , l1 and l2 are in the reverse cyclic ordering to AL . The\ncovariance of all tree-level amplitudes under conformal transformations was proved\nin [2] and indeed covariance under the more general transformations defined here was\nalso proven there.\nPutting all this together we get that the cut amplitude transforms with weight\n2\n\nn\nX\na=1\n\nx\u03bca (1 \u2212 2\u03bca + 2\u03bca\u22121 ) + 2(4 \u2212 D)y \u03bc .\n\n(A.16)\n\nThe first term is the expected covariant term, whereas the second is the contribution\nto the one-loop dual conformal anomaly quoted in (3.6).\n\nReferences\n[1] J.
