For instance it was shown in the early 1970's that\nthe Fermi surface spin polarization of a ferromagnetic\nmetal could be measured by spin-resolved tunneling between a ferromagnet and a superconducting film in the\npresence of Zeeman splitting2 . The Fermi surface spin\npolarization was measured more recently3,4 by Andreev\nreflection at F/S interfaces5 with highly transparent interfaces, not in thin film geometries. The non equilibrium spin population in the ferromagnet plays also a role\nin Andreev reflection at F/S interfaces6,7,8 . Andreev reflection with Zeeman splitting in a thin film geometry\ncould be another way to probe the Fermi surface spin\npolarization9 .\nThese experiments can be interpreted without discussing the proximity effect (the pair correlations induced in the normal metal or ferromagnet) that has focused an important interest recently. It is well established both theoretically and experimentally that the\npair amplitude induced in a ferromagnetic metal oscillates in space and can become negative10,11,12,13,14 , giving rise to the \u03c0-coupling. The \u03c0-coupling generates\noscillations of the critical temperature of F/S multilayers as a function of the thickness of the ferromag-\n\n\u2217 E-mail:\n\nmelin@grenoble.cnrs.fr\n5001 du CNRS, Laboratoire conventionn\u00e9 avec l'Universit\u00e9\nJoseph Fourier\n\u2020 U.P.R.\n\nnetic layers15,16,17,18,19 . The bad quality of interfaces\nmay however also play a role in these experiments20,21 .\nDirect evidences of the \u03c0-coupling have been obtained\nrecently22,23,24,25 . The proximity effect at F/S interfaces\nis related to the formation of the so-called Andreev bound\nstates. Andreev bound states were first discussed by\nde Gennes and Saint-James26 and Andreev27 for normal\nmetal (N)/S interfaces. Several theoretical investigations\nof Andreev bound states at F/S interfaces have been presented recently21,28,29 as well as numerical investigations\nof the proximity effect at F/S interfaces, based on simulations of the Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations30 .\nThe interest in the inverse proximity effect (the properties of the superconductor) at F/S interfaces dates back\nto the 1960's31,32,33 where it was shown that with insulating ferromagnets an exchange field is induced in the superconducting electrode of a F/S/F trilayer in the parallel alignment. The theoretical prediction by de Gennes31\nwas further confirmed by experiments in the late 1960's\nwith metallic32 and insulating33 ferromagnets. Recent\nexperiments were carried out with metallic ferromagnets,\nwhich confirmed the effect on the critical temperature34 .\nIt was shown recently35,36 that an exchange field in the\nsuperconductor exists also with metallic ferromagnets\nbut the sign of the magnetization in the superconductor is opposite to the magnetization in the ferromagnet.\nAn exchange field in a superconductor is pair breaking.\nAs a consequence the superconducting transition temperature in the parallel alignment is smaller than in the\nantiparallel alignment.\nWith metallic ferromagnets the proximity effect may\ninfluence the value of the superconducting gap and transition temperature. It was realized recently36,37,38,39,40\nthat the proximity effect in F/S/F trilayers is quite\nspecial since under some conditions the zero temperature superconducting gap in the parallel alignment\ncan be larger than in the antiparallel alignment. This\nwas established36,37 within a model of multiterminal hybrid structure originally proposed for transport\nproperties41,42,43,44,45 and is related to spatially separated superconducting correlations among the two ferro-\n\n\f2\nmagnets. The same behavior was found within a model\nof F/S/F trilayer with atomic thickness and half-metal\nferromagnets39, which was finally extended to Stoner\nferromagnets40.\n\nD\nH\n(a)\n\nOther physical effects take place with weak ferromagnets for which the exchange field is smaller than the superconducting gap, as indicated by the reentrance of the\ncritical temperature of F/S superlattices as a function\nof the exchange field46,47 , and by the reentrance of the\ncritical temperature of F/S bilayers as a function of the\nthickness of the ferromagnet38,48,49 . The full temperature dependence of the self-consistent superconducting\ngap was calculated in Ref. 40 and it was shown that for\nF/S bilayers or F/S/F trilayers with atomic thickness the\nsuperconducting gap can have a non monotonic temperature dependence: within a given range of parameters the\nsuperconducting gap first increases as temperature T is\nreduced, reaches a maximum, and decreases to zero as T\nis further reduced. Within a narrow range of interface\ntransparencies there exists also a reentrant behavior of\nthe superconducting gap at low temperature40 .\n\nF\n\nS\n\nF\n\ny\n\nx\n\nz\n\n0\n\n(b) W\n\nL\n\nL\n\nLS\n\nF\n\nF\n\nS\n\nF\n\nd'\n\nd\n\nFIG. 1: (a) Schematic representation of the F/S/F trilayer.\nD and H are sent to to infinity (infinite planar geometry).\nThe ferromagnets (superconductor) are made of LF (LS ) layers stacked in the lateral (z) direction.

Different regimes\ncan be obtained depending on how the lateral dimensions\nLS of the superconductor and LF of the ferromagnets\ncompare respectively (i) to the zero temperature lateral\n(\u22a5)\nsuperconducting coherence length \u03beS = 2t0 a0 /\u03c0\u220628 ,\nwhere t0 is the lateral hoping amplitude, and a0 is equal\nto the interatomic distance in the tranverse direction;\nand (ii) to the zero temperature lateral exchange length\n(\u22a5)\n\u03beF = 2t0 a0 /\u03c0hex 28 .

We note LS the\nthickness of the superconductor (see Fig. 1). The three\nelectrodes are made of 2D planes stacked along the z axis\n(see Fig. 2). Each superconducting plane is described by\n\n\f3\nthe BCS Hamiltonian\nX\n(2D)\nHBCS =\n\u01eb(k)c+\nk,\u03c3 ck,\u03c3\n\nB.\n\n(1)\n\n1.\n\nGreen's functions\n\nZero temperature Green's functions\n\nk,\u03c3\n\n+ \u2206\n\nX\u0010\nk\n\n\u0011\n+\n,\nc+\nc\n+\nc\nc\nk,\u2193\n\u2212k,\u2191\nk,\u2191 \u2212k,\u2193\n\nwhere the wave vector k is parallel to the 2D layer. The\nfree electron dispersion relation within one layer is \u01eb(k) =\n~2 k 2 /2m. The ferromagnets are described by the Stoner\nmodel\nX\n(2D)\nHStoner =\n\u01eb(k)c+\n(2)\nk,\u03c3 ck,\u03c3\nk,\u03c3\n\n\u0011\nX\u0010\n+\n\u2212 hex\nc+\nk,\u2191 ck,\u2191 \u2212 ck,\u2193 ck,\u2193 ,\nk\n\nwhere hex is the exchange field. The coupling between\ntwo planes belonging to the same superconducting or ferromagnetic electrode is given by\nX\n\u0001\n+\nWF\u2212F = WS\u2212S = t0\nc+\nxL ,\u03c3 cxR ,\u03c3 + cxR ,\u03c3 cxL ,\u03c3 ,\nxL ,\u03c3\n\n(3)\nwhereas the coupling between the ferromagnets and the\nsuperconductor is given by\nX\n\u0001\n+\n(4)\nc+\nWF\u2212S = t\nxL ,\u03c3 cxR ,\u03c3 + cxR ,\u03c3 cxL ,\u03c3 ,\nxL ,\u03c3\n\nwhere the summation runs over all sites at the interface (xL corresponds to a site on the left side and xR\nis the corresponding site on the right side). The parameters are such that the coherence length within one\n(k)\n(k)\nlayer \u03beS = ~vF /\u2206 and the tranverse coherence length\n(\u22a5)\n\u03beS = 2t0 a0 /\u03c0\u2206 are larger than the width LS of the superconductor. The model should stricktly speaking apply\nto ballistic systems whereas real samples are usually in\nthe diffusive regime. However we can include disorder\nin one particular case (the F/S/F trilayer with atomic\nthickness, see section IV C). In this case the qualitative\nbehavior is robust against increasing disorder. FabryPerot resonances generate parity effects for small values\nof LS and LF in the ballistic model. These parity effects\nare not expected to occur in the diffusive regime, but\ndo not occur either in our simulations if LS and LF are\nsufficiently large. By increasing LF and LS we obtain\na cross-over between the regime LF , LS . \u03bbF and the\n(\u22a5)\nregime \u03bbF . LF , LS \u226a \u03beS . We find the same qualitative effects in the two regimes. Moreover we obtain in\nsection V a non monotonic variation of the self-consistent\nsuperconducting gap as a function of the exchange field.\nThis is compatible with the non monotonic variation of\nthe critical temperature as a function of the exchange\nfield38,48,49 obtained in the context of linearized Usadel\nequations for disordered conductors. The compatibility\nbetween the two behaviors indicates the validity of our\napproach.\n\nThe Green's functions of an isolated superconductor can be gathered in a 4 \u00d7 4 matrix in the spin \u2297\nNambu representation but in the absence of non collinear\nmagnetizations44,50,51,52 the quantization axis can be\nchosen parallel to the exchange field so that the 4 \u00d7 4\nGreen's functions reduce to two separate 2 \u00d7 2 matrices,\none in each spin sector.

In this respect the\n(LS /a0 , LF /a0 ) = (1, 1) trilayer is just viewed as a toymodel: we use a mean field approach that does not incorporate the phase fluctuations of the order parameter\nand we do not consider possible instabilities such as spin\nor charge density wave.\nThe ferromagnetic and superconducting electrodes of\nthe F/S/F trilayer consist of a finite number of layers\nstacked along the z axis and labeled from 1 to L (see\nFig. 2). Two consecutive layers n and n+1 are coupled by\na tunnel amplitude tn .

We\nobtain a reentrant behavior in a narrow range of interface transparencies (not shown on Fig. 3). By contrast\nwe obtain a monotonic behavior for off-resonant values\nof (LS /a0 , LF /a0 ), as expected from Appendix A.\nThe values of the tunnel amplitude needed to destroy\nsuperconductivity for off-resonant trilayers (see Figs. 3(b) and (d)) is almost ten times larger than in the reso-\n\nRole of the exchange field\n\nWe repeated the simulations for the F/S/F trilayer\nwith (LS /a0 , LF /a0 ) = (2, 2) but with different values\nof hex /\u22060 . For the smallest value of hex /\u22060 (hex /\u22060 =\n0.28) we obtained a monotonic decrease of the superconducting gap as a function of temperature for all values of\nthe tunnel amplitude. For hex /\u22060 = 0.56, 0.83, 1.11, 1.39\nwe obtained a non monotonic temperature dependence of\nthe superconducting gap similar to Fig. 3-(a) and Fig. 3(b). The non monotonic variation of the superconducting\ngap occurs typically for hex being a fraction of \u22060 up to\nvalues slightly above \u22060 .\n\nB.\n\nRelation between the local density of states and\nthe self-consistent superconducting gap\n1.\n\nLocal density of states in the parallel alignment\n\nThe spin-up LDOS \u03c1\u2191 (\u03c9) in the superconductor is\nshown on Fig. 4 for the F/S/F trilayer in the paral-\n\n\f6\n\n2.\n\nFinite temperature local density of states\n\nThe spin-up LDOS at a finite temperature T is related the conductance of a scanning tunneling microscope\n(STM) in which the tip is made of a half-metal ferromagnet. The finite temperature current at an arbitrary voltage is obtained through Keldysh formalism. The finite\n\n0.3\n\nLDOS (arb. units)\n\nlel alignment, for (LS /a0 , LF /a0 ) = (1, 3). We obtained similar results for (LS /a0 , LF /a0 ) = (2, 2). The\nspin-down LDOS \u03c1\u2193 (\u03c9) is obtained through the relation\n\u03c1\u2193 (\u03c9) = \u03c1\u2191 (\u2212\u03c9). The zero temperature superconducting gap \u2206 is fixed to the BCS value \u22060 of an isolated\nsuperconducting layer.\nThe case of a N/S interface is shown on Fig. 4-(a) and\nFig. 4-(b). The LDOS is symmetric with respect to a\nchange of sign in energy, as expected in the absence of\nan exchange field. There exists a minigap at the Fermi\nenergy so that superconductivity is robust against increasing the tunnel amplitude t. Increasing t gives rise\nto pairs of Andreev bound states at opposite energies (see\nFig. 4-(a)). Each peak corresponds to a miniband, which\nis visible on Fig. 4-(b) obtained with larger values of t.\nThe formation of the minibands is related to the infinite\nplanar geometry: the layers are infinite in the x and y\ndirections (see Fig. 1) and there is thus a degeneracy associated to the position of the Andreev bound state in\nthe (x, y) plane. The bound state can delocalize in the\n(x, y) plane and thus acquire a dispersion which would\nnot occur if the dimensions H and D (see Fig. 1) were\nsmall compared to the BCS coherence length, a situation\nconsidered in Ref. 28.\nFor weak ferromagnets with t, hex and \u2206 having the\nsame order of magnitude (panel (c) on Fig. 4) we obtain\none Andreev bound state miniband inside the gap and\none resonant scattering state above the gap. The Andreev bound state miniband moves to the Fermi energy\nas the tunnel amplitude t increases (see Fig. 4-(c)) and\nappears at a positive energy for larger values of t (see\nFig. 4-(d)).\nFor larger values of the exchange field the Andreev\nbound state miniband disappears from the LDOS. For\nhex /\u22060 \u226b 1 the induced exchange field is opposite to\nthe magnetization in the ferromagnets35,36 .\nThere are thus two qualitatively different depairing\nmechanisms for strong and weak ferromagnets. For\nstrong ferromagnets with hex /\u22060 \u226b 1 (see Figs. 4-(e)\nand 4-(f)) the breakdown of superconductivity is due\nmainly to Zeeman splitting. The case of very weak ferromagnets (hex /\u22060 \u226a 1) resembles that case hex /\u22060 = 0:\nnon perturbative Andreev bound states are generated in\nthe superconducting gap approximately at opposite energies. In the case hex /\u22060 \u223c 1 the Andreev bound state\nminiband can be at zero energy, therefore destructing the\nminigap.\n\nT/\u22060 = 0.056\nT/\u22060 = 0.17\nT/\u22060 = 0.28\n\n0.2\n\n0.1\n\n0\n-2.5\n\n0\n\n2.5\n\nE/\u22060\nFIG. 5: Energy dependence of the finite temperature\nspin-up LDOS (in arbitrary units) in the superconducting\nlayer of the F/S/F trilayer in the parallel alignment with\n(LS /a0 , LF /a0 ) = (1, 3).

Increasing temperature tends to reduce the\nintensity of the Andreev bound state at the Fermi energy on Fig. 4-(c) so that the LDOS at the Fermi energy\ndecreases if T increases. For relatively large values of\nT the peak structure has almost disappeared from the\nLDOS but there remains a minimum associated to the\nsuperconducting gap that is significantly filled. As T increases there is thus a first cross-over where the peak at\nthe Fermi energy disappears and a superconducting minigap is restored, and a second cross-over where the superconducting gap disappears. The first cross over occurs\nat a temperature equal to the bandwidth of the Andreev\nbound state miniband and the second cross-over occurs\nat a temperature comparable to the zero temperature\nsuperconducting gap. The finite temperature LDOS is\nthus in a qualitative agreement with the non monotonic\nself-consistent superconducting gap.\nReentrance obtained in a narrow range of interface\ntransparencies40 can also be explained by this qualitative\npicture: if the Andreev bound state miniband is narrow\nand located at a slightly positive energy like on Fig. 4(c) then the LDOS at the Fermi energy is vanishingly\nsmall at T = 0 since the Fermi energy is not in the Andreev bound state miniband. By increasing T the width\nof the Andreev bound state miniband increases so that\nthe density of states at the Fermi energy increases. By\nfurther increasing T the intensity of the Andreev bound\nstate miniband is reduced, and the density of states at the\nFermi energy decreases.

The LDOS is symmetric with respect\nto a change of sign of energy, but not equivalent to the\nLDOS of a N/S interface (see Fig. 4-(a) and Fig. 4-(b)).\nThere exists a well-defined minimum at the Fermi energy\ncorresponding to the superconducting minigap. The energy dependence of the LDOS in the antiparallel alignment shows that superconductivity is stronger than in\nthe parallel alignment, both for weak and strong ferromagnets. This is expected because of the exchange field\ninduced in the superconductor in the antiparallel alignment is reduced compared to the parallel alignment31 .\nThe self-consistent superconducting gap has a monotonic\ntemperature dependence in this case which is because a\nwell-defined minigap is obtained in the LDOS.\n\nC.\n\nt / \u22060 = 0.70\nt / \u22060 = 0.97\nt / \u22060 = 1.25\n\n0.75\n\n\u2206(T) / \u22060\n\nLDOS (arb. units)\n\n7\n\nRole of disorder for weak ferromagnets and for\nthe F/S/F trilayer with atomic thickness\n\nDisorder plays an important role in the proximity effect. Diffusive N/S interfaces are described by quasiclassical theory54 . A small disorder can be incorporated\nin our description based on microscopic Green's functions like in Ref. 53 (see Appendix B). The strength\nof disorder\nin the superconductor is characterized by\np\n(0)\n\u03b4S = n\u03b1 u2\u03b1 /\u22060 , where n\u03b1 is the concentration of impurities and u\u03b1 is the scattering potential, and we use\n(0)\na similar parameter \u03b4F to characterize disorder in the\n\nferromagnets. We obtain a significant effect of disorder\n(0)\n(0)\nfor relatively large values of \u03b4S and \u03b4F .\n1.\n\nDisorder in the superconducting and ferromagnetic\nlayers\n\nThe temperature dependence of the self-consistent superconducting gap in the presence of disorder in the superconductor is shown on Fig. 7 for (LS /a0 , LF /a0 ) =\n(1, 1) in the parallel alignment. In the absence of disorder Fig. 7 corresponds to Fig. 3-(a). The effect of disorder\nis to reduce the effect of the tunnel amplitude40 so that\nif disorder increases a larger value of t is needed to destroy superconductivity. Comparing Fig. 3 and Fig. 7 we\nsee that the variations of \u2206(T ) are affected by a weak\ndisorder especially if the F/S/F trilayer in the parallel\nalignment is close to the breakdown of superconductivity. In this case the dimensionless parameter controlling\n(0)\nthe strength of disorder is \u03b4S = \u03b4S \u22060 /\u2206(T ) which can\n(0)\nbe much larger than \u03b4S .\n2.\n\nVertex corrections\n\nThere exist two perturbative series: one in the hopping amplitude t and the other in the disorder scattering\npotential u.

(b) Variation of the self-consistent superconducting gap calculated\nwith hex /\u22060 = 0.56 in the parallel alignment, as a function of\nT /\u22060 . We used in both cases (LF /a0 , LS /a0 ) = (11, 11). The\nFermi wave length is \u03bbF = 6.28a0 . We use t/\u22060 = 5.6 (\u0003 in\nthe P alignment and \u0004 in the AP alignment), t/\u22060 = 8.3 (\u25e6 in\nthe P alignment and \u2022 in the AP alignment), and t/\u22060 = 11.1\n(\u25b3 in the P alignment and N in the AP alignment).\n\nture dependence of the self-consistent superconducting\ngap with the vertex corrections is shown on Fig. 7-(d).\nThe critical temperature is larger if vertex corrections\nare included. We obtain a non monotonic temperature\ndependence of the superconducting gap even in the presence of vertex corrections. The role of vertex corrections\nincreases if t increases since the vertex correction term is\nproportional to n\u03b1 t2 u2\u03b1 .\n\nV. FINITE THICKNESS IN THE\n(\u22a5)\n(\u22a5)\nSUPERCONDUCTOR (LS . \u03beS AND LF \u226a \u03beF )\n\nIn this section we include a finite thickness in the su(\u22a5)\nperconductor for LF \u226a \u03beF . For weak ferromagnets in\nthe regime hex /\u22060 \u223c 1 we obtain non monotonic temperature dependences of the self-consistent superconducting\ngap in the parallel alignment, therefore confirming section IV.\nWe have shown on Fig. 8-(a) the variation of the selfconsistent superconducting gap in the middle of the superconductor as a function of the reduced exchange field\nhex /\u22060 . As expected from the variation of the critical\ntemperature38,47,48 we obtain a minimum if the exchange\nfield is comparable to the superconducting gap. Moreover\nwe obtain a minimum also in the antiparallel alignment\nthat is related to the minigap formed in between Andreev\nbound states at opposite energies (see section IV B 3).\nThe full temperature dependence of the self-consistent\nsuperconducting gap in the parallel alignment is shown\n(\u22a5)\non Fig. 8-(b) for LS /a0 = 11 (comparable to \u03beS /a0 ) and\n(\u22a5)\nLF /a0 = 11 (much smaller than \u03beF /a0 ). We obtain a\nmaximum in the variation of \u2206(T )/\u22060 in the parallel\nalignment. We carried out the same simulation in the\nantiparallel alignment and found a monotonic temper-\n\n(\u22a5)\n\nWe discuss now the regime LS \u226a \u03beS and LF & \u03beF .\nWe find Andreev bound states at the Fermi energy in\nthe parallel alignment for strong ferromagnets, correlated\nwith non monotonic temperature dependences of the selfconsistent superconducting gap.\nThe regime LF & \u03beF is characterized by oscillations\nof the self-consistent superconducting gap, critical temperature and pair amplitude as a function of LF . We\nobtain bound states within the superconducting gap and\nresonant scattering states outside the superconducting\ngap. We calculated systematically the LDOS and the\nself-consistent superconducting gap for LS /a0 = 1, 2 and\nLF /a0 = 1, ..., 100, in the parallel and antiparallel alignments (see Fig. 9). The systematic calculation of the\nfinite temperature LDOS given by Eq. (17) is too demanding from a computational point of view. Instead\nwe calculate the LDOS at zero temperature with \u03b7 = T .\nThe consistency between the two calculations was verified\nin a few cases. Depending on the interface transparencies \u2206(LF /a0 )/\u22060 tends either to a finite value or to zero\nin the limit LF /a0 \u2192 +\u221e. We concentrate on the first\ncase only. For 1 \u2264 LF /a0 \u2264 40 we see on Fig. 9 that\non average the superconducting gap is smaller when the\nLDOS at the Fermi energy is larger. For LS /a0 = 1 and\nt/\u22060 = 2.8 (see Fig. 9-(b)) we obtain \u2206(T )/\u22060 = 0\nfor four values of LF /a0 (LF /a0 = 4, 6, 11, 13). For\nthree other values of LF /a0 (LF /a0 = 16, 23, 25) we obtain a non monotonic variation of \u2206(T )/\u22060 . For two\nother values of LF /a0 (LF /a0 = 32 and LF /a0 = 35)\n\u2206(T )/\u22060 is monotonic but far from the BCS variation.\nThese nine values of LF /a0 with an anomalous temperature dependence of the self-consistent superconducting\ngap have large values of the LDOS at the Fermi energy\n(\u03c1(\u03c9 = 0) > 0.045 on Fig. 9-(b), in arbitrary units). Like\nin section IV B 1 Andreev bound states near the Fermi\nenergy correlate with unconventional temperature dependences of the superconducting gap.\n(\u22a5)\nFor 40 \u2264 LF /a0 \u2264 100 corresponding to LF \u226b \u03beF ,\nwe obtain a cloud of points with a small dispersion and\nwith no correlation between the superconducting gap and\nthe LDOS at the Fermi energy. This corresponds to the\ncross-over to the F/S/F trilayer with bulk ferromagnets.\nWe obtain bound states within the superconducting\ngap and unconventional temperature dependences of the\nsuperconducting gap with strong ferromagnets in the parallel alignment. By contrast with strong ferromagnets we\nobtain a conventional temperature dependence of the superconducting gap for the F/S/F trilayer with smaller\nvalues of (LS /a0 , LF /a0 )40 .\nWe carried out the same simulation in the antiparallel\nalignment and found that \u2206(T )/\u22060 is close to the BCS\n\n\f9\n0.15\n\n1\n\n(a)\n\n(c)\n\n(e)\n0.5\n\nE/\u2206\n\nLDOS (arb. units)\n\n0.1\n\n0.05\n\n-0.5\n\n0\n\n(b)\n\n(d)\n\n(a)\n\n(f)\n\n(b)\n\n-1\n0\n\n0.1\n\n1000\n\n2000\n\n3000\n\n4000\n\n0\n\n1000\n\n2000\n\n3000\n\n4000\n\n5000\n\nLF/a0\n0.05\n\n0\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1 0\n\n0.5\n\n1 0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n\u2206/\u22060\nFIG. 9: Correlation between \u2206/\u22060 and the LDOS at the\nFermi energy (in arbitrary units) for LS /a0 = 1 and LF /a0\nbetween 1 and 40. The temperature is T /\u22060 = 0.14. In the\ncalculation of the LDOS the superconducting gap is not selfconsistent. We use strong ferromagnets with hex /\u22060 = 13.9\n(\u22a5)\nand \u03beF = 1.3a0 . We use LS /a0 = 1 and t/\u22060 = 2.1 (a);\nLS /a0 = 1 and t/\u22060 = 2.8 (b); LS /a0 = 2 and t/\u22060 = 3.5\n(c); LS /a0 = 2 and t/\u22060 = 4.2 (d); LS /a0 = 1 and t/\u22060 =\n2.8 (e); LS /a0 = 1 and t/\u22060 = 3.3 (f).

A larger density\nof states at the Fermi energy correlates with smaller values of the self-consistent superconducting gap like in the\nparallel alignment (see Fig. 9-(e) and (f)). Because of\nthe minigap that can be formed since the bound states\nare at opposite energies (see Fig. 6) we do not obtain\nthe points with large values of the density of states at\nthe Fermi energy like in the parallel alignment. The absence of large values of the LDOS at the Fermi energy\nis related to the fact that the Andreev levels in the antiparallel alignment do not cross the Fermi energy as the\ninterface transparency is increased.\n\nVII.\n\n0\n\nCOMPARISON WITH OTHER MODELS\n\nThe discussion in the preceding sections was restricted\nto the infinite planar geometry. Now we discuss Andreev\nbound states in other geometries without imposing selfconsistency on the superconducting gap. In section VII A\nwe improve the discussion of a model proposed by recently Vecino et al.28 in which a ferromagnetic chain is\nconnected to a superconductor55 . In section VII B we\ncompare the LDOS to a model discussed recently by\nCserti et al.29 .\n\nFIG. 10: Reduced energy E/\u2206 of the Andreev bound states as\na function of the number of sites LF /a0 in the ferromagnetic\nchain for weak ferromagnets (hex /\u2206 = 0.5). We used the\nparameters \u2206/t = \u22060 /tF = 0.01, t/tS = 0.01 , LS = 105 a0 .\nThe entire spectrum is kept in (a). Only the levels with a\nresidue larger than 2 are kept in (b). The superconducting\ngap is not self-consistent.\n\nA.\n\nA one dimensional model\n\nWe suppose that the superconductor and ferromagnets\nare described by 1D chains with open boundary conditions with LS /a0 sites in the superconductor and LF /a0\nsites in the ferromagnet. We denote by tS (tF ) the hopping amplitude in the superconductor (ferromagnet) and\nwe use tS = tF . The energy level spacing in the superconductor is much smaller than the superconducting gap\n\u2206.\nWe have shown on Fig. 10 the evolution of the energy\nof Andreev bound states as a function of the length of\nthe ferromagnetic chain obtained with the algorithm presented in Appendix C. The spectrum is symmetric under a change of sign in energy if we keep all energy levels\ninto account. Andreev bound states arising from the gap\nedges move to the Fermi energy as LF /a0 increases28 .\nThere is level repulsion between Andreev bound state and\noscillations of the energy levels with a period of order 10\ntimes \u03beF = 2tF a0 /\u03c0hex . These oscillations do not exist\nin Ref. 28. Among all Andreev bound states obtained at\na fixed LF /a0 some have a spectral weight much larger\nthan the other. We keep only the levels having a spectral\nweight larger than a given cut-off. The evolution of the\nremaining Andreev bound states as a function of LF /a0\nis then in agreement with Ref. 28.\nIn connection with the discussion in section IV B 1 we\nsee that Andreev bound states near the Fermi energy\noccur only if the ferromagnetic chain is long enough,\nlarger than approximately 10 times \u03beS = 2tS a0 /\u03c0\u2206. This\nshould be contrasted with the LDOS in the infinite planar limit discussed in section IV B 1, and with the model\ndiscussed in section VII B.\n\n\f\u03c1(E/\u2206) (arb. units)\n\n10\n\n(a)\n\n300\n\n200\n\n(b)\nZ = 1000\nZ = 200\n\nZ = 40\nZ=8\n\n100\n\n0\n-1\n\n0\n\n-1\n1\n\n0\n\n1\n\nE/\u2206\n\nFIG. 11: Density of Andreev bound states (in arbitrary units)\n\u03c1(E/\u2206) as a function of reduced energy E/\u2206 for Z = 1000\nand Z = 200 (a); Z = 40 and Z = 8 (b). We used the\nparameters \u2206/\u01ebF = 0.02, \u2206 = 0.01, hex /\u2206 = 0.5, d = \u03bbF /2,\nW \u2243 15900\u03bbF where \u03bbF = 2\u03c0/kF is the Fermi wave length.\n\nB.\n\nBogoliubov-de Gennes equations\n\nWe consider now the model proposed by Cserti et al.29\nin which a 2D ferromagnetic dot with a rectangular shape\nof dimensions (d, W ) is connected to a superconductor\n(see Fig. 1-(b)). The superconductor has a width W but\nis infinite in the other direction (d\u2032 = +\u221e on Fig. 1). Using the solution of this model29 based on Bogoliubov-de\nGennes equations we generated the set {En } of Andreev\nbound state energies. Like for the de Gennes-Saint James\nmodel26 the density of bound states is not equal to the\nLDOS in the superconductor28 . The evolution of the density of Andreev bound states as a function of the interface\ntransparency is shown on Fig. 11. The interface transparency is parametrized by the dimensionless coefficient\nZ, equal to the repulsive interface potential in units of\nthe Fermi energy56 . For large values of Z (corresponding to tunnel interfaces) we obtain an Andreev bound\nstate miniband around E/\u22060 = hex /\u22060 . As the interface transparency decreases the miniband broadens and\nsplits into two separate minibands (see Fig. 11). This is\nin a qualitative agreement with section IV B 1 (see Fig. 4(c) and Fig. 4-(d)) where we obtain also Andreev bound\nstate minibands that evolve inside the superconducting\ngap and can generate a large density of states at the\nFermi energy for some values of the interface transparencies.\n\nVIII.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nWe have presented a detailed analysis of F/S/F trilayers with weak ferromagnets based on microscopic Green's\nfunctions. The exchange field induced in the superconductor in the regime hex /\u22060 \u226b 1 generates Zeeman splitting of the LDOS the regime hex /\u22060 \u226a 1 is characterized\nby Andreev bound states. In the non perturbative regime\nt/\u22060 \u223c hex /\u22060 \u223c 1 the Andreev bound state miniband\ncrosses the Fermi energy as the interface transparency\nis increased therefore competing with the formation of\n\na minigap, which explains why the self-consistent superconducting gap is weakened by the formation of an Andreev bound state miniband near the Fermi energy. Increasing temperature decreases the intensity of the Andreev bound state peak in the LDOS which correlates\nwith a reduction of the low temperature self-consistent\nsuperconducting gap.\nWe found non monotonic temperature dependences\nof the superconducting gap with weak ferromagnets for\n(\u22a5)\n(\u22a5) (\u22a5)\nLF , LS \u226a \u03beF , \u03beS as well as for LS \u223c \u03beS and\n(\u22a5)\n(\u22a5)\n(\u22a5)\nLF \u226a \u03beF . In the regime LS \u226a \u03beS and LF & \u03beF\nwe obtain non monotonic temperature dependences for\nsome values of LF /a0 for strong ferromagnets.\nFor the F/S/F trilayer in the parallel alignment we find\npairs of Andreev bound states at opposite energies but\nthere exists a minigap so that the self-consistent superconducting gap decreases monotonically with temperature. However at a fixed temperature the self-consistent\nsuperconducting gap is non monotonic as a function of\nthe exchange field which is due to pairs of Andreev bound\nstates at opposite energies in the regime hex /\u22060 \u223c 1 \u226a\nt/\u22060 .\nConcerning the induced exchange field in the F/S/F\ntrilayer in the parallel alignment we find that for weak\nferromagnets the exchange field is in the same direction\nas in the ferromagnetic electrodes whereas it is in the opposite direction for strong ferromagnets. The change of\nsign is visible both in the LDOS and in the magnetization profile. As the exchange field in the ferromagnets is\nincreased we find a first order transition to the normal\nstate, as for paramagnetically limited superconducting\nfilms in an applied magnetic field.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nThe author wishes to thank D.

Let us consider a F/S/F trilayer\nwith LF /a0 layers in the ferromagnets and LS /a0 layers\nin the superconductor. Quasiparticles in the superconductor with a transverse quantum number nS can tunnel\nin the ferromagnets only if there exists an energy level\nwith quantum number nF close to resonance in the ferromagnets, such that \u01ebnS (LS ) \u2243 \u01ebnF (LF ). If tunneling\nbetween the ferromagnets and superconductor is not resonant then the F/S/F trilayer behaves as if the ferromagnets were insulating.
