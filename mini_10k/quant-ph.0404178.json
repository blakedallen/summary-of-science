One of the most widely encountered representations of the photon field is of a\nquantized Gibbs (column) vector potential\nX Z \u221e d3 p\np\n[e\u03bc (p, \u03c3)a(p, \u03c3)eipx + e\u03bc\u2217 (p, \u03c3)a\u2020 (p, \u03c3)e\u2212ipx ]\n(1)\nA \u03bc (x) = (2\u03c0)\u22123/2\n0\n2p\n\u2212\u221e\n\u03c3\n\nin which e\u03bc (p, \u03c3), the photon polarization vector, satisfies p\u03bc e\u03bc (p, \u03c3) = 0, e0 (p, \u03c3) = 0. For a pure motion in the\n1-direction\n\u221a\ne(p, \u00b1\u03c3) = (0, 0, \u00b1i, 1)/ 2\n(2)\n\nBecause the polarization vectors are transverse, they impart to the field the influence of holonomy, a quantity associated\nwith the change in orientation of a tangent vector directed by parallel transport around a non-Euclidean surface. A\nsubstantial literature has developed around the discovery by Berry [3] that the transport of a quantum system through\nan adiabatic circuit induces a change in phase that is dependent on the area of the surface enclosed and the angular\nmomentum of the system. The identification of this effect with holonomy [4], its realization experimentally through\nexperiments with light [5, 6], the elucidation of its origins in the Poincar\u00e9 group [7, 8, 9], and the ensuing debate\nover whether the experimentally observed effects have classical or quantum origins [10, 11, 12, 13] have recently\nbeen reviewed comprehensively [14]. Berry's original treatment has been extended to non adiabatic circuits [15] and\nopen trajectories [16, 17]; and the contributions of holonomy were recognized [18] to be implicit in earlier studies\nof polarization phase by Pancharatnam [19, 20] and in the proposal by Aharanov and Bohm [21] to measure phase\nchanges in non-simply connected topologies.\nIn this work we carry out a direct calculation to demonstrate that the photon polarization 'vector' is not a vector but\na complex bivector, and that the bivector can be equated with the electromagnetic field, not the vector potential. The\nbivector field exhibits a phase freedom associated with rotation history that cannot be separated from the observer\nframe. If the widely used Gibbs vector formalism is extended to spaces in which the time dimension has imaginary\nweight, a covariant Hamiltonian can be created that yields well-behaved eigensolutions with positive and negative\nenergy eigenvalues and that yields the Maxwell equations upon application to the fields. Current and translation\noperators can be defined that are free of various defects associated with the quantized vector potential. Experimental\ntests can be devised that distinguish between a vector potential and a bivector, using a simple idealization of a single\nmode state to explore contrasting predictions of the dependence of the energy of a photon on its modulation envelope.\nII.\n\nA COVARIANT OPERATOR ALGEBRA FOR GIBBS VECTORS\n\nIn the following the metric signature is (\u2212 + ++) and 'a pure motion in the n-direction' signifies that the velocities\nalong the spatial axes j 6= n are null. Our first task is to develop a covariant Gibbs vector algebra that allows a\n\n\f2\nHamiltonian equation for the electromagnetic field. To achieve this we introduce operators \u03c7 \u03bc that can be considered\nanalogs, in a vector representation, of the Weyl operators \u03c3 \u03bc in the spinor representation. The components \u03c7 \u03bc\n(formally, \u03c7 \u03bc\u03bd \u03c1 ) are rank two tensors that can be written\n\uf8eb\n1\n\uf8ec0\n{\uf8ed\n0\n0\n\n0\n1\n0\n0\n\n0\n0\n1\n0\n\n\uf8f6 \uf8eb\n0\n0\n0\uf8f7 \uf8ec\u2212i\n,\n0\uf8f8 \uf8ed 0\n0\n1\n\ni\n0\n0\n0\n\n0\n0\n0\ni\n\n\uf8f6 \uf8eb\n0\n0\n0\uf8f7 \uf8ec0\n,\n\u2212i\uf8f8 \uf8ed\u2212i\n0\n0\n\n0\n0\n0\n\u2212i\n\ni\n0\n0\n0\n\n\uf8f6 \uf8eb\n0\n0\ni\uf8f7 \uf8ec 0\n,\n0\uf8f8 \uf8ed 0\n\u2212i\n0\n\n0\n0\ni\n0\n\n0\n\u2212i\n0\n0\n\n\uf8f6\ni\n0\uf8f7\n}\n0\uf8f8\n0\n\n(3)\n\nThe \u03c7 \u03bc\u03bd \u03c1 and the related \u03c7 \u03bc \u03bd \u03c1 constitute two subalgebras of M at(4, C) that are isomorphic to the left and right\nsubalgebras of the real matrix representation of quaternion multiplication M at(4, R) \u2243 H \u2297 H [22]. The three spatial\noperators \u03c7j have eigenvalues of \u00b11 and eigensolutions that are irreducible representations of the Lorentz group\nin a space that assigns imaginary weight to the (scalar) time direction. In this space the boost transformations\nare reflections, so the fundamental group operation is a reflection. Reflections are in any case more primitive than\nrotations since by a theorem of Hamilton any rotation can be decomposed as a pair of reflections, e.g. [23]. The\nnormalized eigensolutions of \u03c71 are:\n\uf8eb \uf8f6\n\uf8eb \uf8f6\n\uf8eb \uf8f6\n\uf8eb \uf8f6\ni\n\u2212i\n0\n0\n1 \uf8ec 0 \uf8f7 1 \uf8ec0\uf8f7 1 \uf8ec1\uf8f7 1 \uf8ec 1 \uf8f7\n(4)\n{ \u221a \uf8ed \uf8f8 , \u221a \uf8ed \uf8f8 , \u221a \uf8ed \uf8f8 , \u221a \uf8ed \uf8f8}\n2 \u2212i\n2 i\n2 0\n2 0\n0\n0\n1\n1\nwith respective eigenvalues {1, \u22121, 1, \u22121}. The first pair are eigenbivectors or simply bivectors and correspond to the\ntwo orthogonal states of the polarization 'vector' (2); the second pair are time-imaginary vectors. Like the \u03c3 j , the\n\u03c7 j , j \u2208 1, 2, 3 form the basis of a Clifford or geometric algebra Cl3 on R3 defined in the usual way by\n\u03c7i \u03c7j + \u03c7j \u03c7i = 2\u03b4 ij 14\n\n(5)\n\nwhere 14 is the 4 \u00d7 4 identity matrix. By (5) appropriately normed Clifford numbers composed from the \u03c7i are\nelements of the (odd + even) group Pin(3) with Pin(3)/{\u00b11} \u2243 SO(3), since Pin(n) forms a double cover of SO(n),\n[22, 24]. The \u03c7i can be divided into spatial and temporal parts \u03c7i = K i + S i = K i + S i , where\nS0 j k = \u03b4jk\n\nK0 0 0 = 1\n\nSi 0 \u03bc = Si \u03bc 0 = 0\n\nKi 0 j = \u2212Ki j 0 = i \u03b4ij\n\nSi j k = \u2212i\u01ebi j k\n\n(6)\n\nK\u03bc j k = 0\n\n(7)\n\nThe Si are the generators of the spin one rotation operator about axis i, often written Ji j k , and have, with the Ki ,\nthe following properties:\nSi 2 + Ki 2 := Si j k Si k l + Ki j k Ki k l = \u03b4 j l\n\n(8)\n\ne\u03ba Si = Ki 2 + Si 2 cosh \u03ba + Si sinh \u03ba\n\n(9)\n\nThe Si are also the generators of bivector boosts in direction i. The Ki are the generators of vector boosts in direction\ni and satisfy\ne\u03ba Ki = Si 2 + Ki 2 cosh \u03ba + Ki sinh \u03ba\n\n(10)\n\nThe first two and last two elements of (4) are eigen(bi)vectors of S1 and K1 respectively.\nThe Si and Ki obey the commutation relations\n[Si , Sj ] = i \u01ebij k Sk\n[Ki , Kj ] = i \u01ebij k Sk\n[Si , Kj ] = i \u01ebij k Kk\nand the above relations differ from the usual formulation only in the sign of the righthand side of the middle equation.\nHowever as a result the operators \u03c7i conform to the Lie algebra of the quaternions,\n[\u03c7i , \u03c7j ] = 2 i \u01ebij k \u03c7k\n\n(11)\n\n\f3\nThe Hamiltonian operator \u03c7j pj has doubly degenerate eigenvalues \u00b1p0 and hence admits a covariant equation of\nthe form\n\u03c7 \u03bc p\u03bc \u03c8 = 0\n\n(12)\n\nas well as a contravariant (opposite helicity) equation:\n\u03c7 \u03bcp \u03bc\u03c8 = 0\n\n(13)\n\u221a\nIn the case of a pure 1-direction\n\u221a motion the first eigenbivector of (4), \u03c8+ = (0, 0, \u2212i, 1)/ 2 is a solution of (12)\nand the second, \u03c8\u2212 = (0, 0, i, 1)/ 2 is a solution of (13), and these correspond to the positive energy solutions for\na positive and negative helicity particle, respectively. To the \u03c8\u00b1 can be associated complex conjugates \u03c8 \u00b1 ; their\nmodulus, or length, \u03c8 \u00b1 * \u03c8\u00b1 is unity. Like their counterparts in the massless spin 1/2 field, \u03c8+ and \u03c8\u2212 undergo\nboost transformations by different laws, but behave the same way under rotations.

The normalization factor of 1/ 2p0 emerges naturally as a consequence of the unit length of the bivector.\nWith (23) and (24) we have found that explicit application of the program to represent particles as irreducible\nrepresentations of the inhomogeneous Lorentz group in the Gibbs vector representation leads to the conclusion that\nthe elementary excitation of the massless spin one field is not a vector but a complex bivector. In the normalized\nform of (18), the real and imaginary parts can be equated with the electric and magnetic amplitudes of the photon\nfield respectively. That is, (18) can be decomposed as\nzS (p) := ze(p) + i zb(p)\n\n(25)\n\nwhere, for example,\nze(p)1 =\nzb(p)1 =\nN=\n\n\u221a\n\n2 p0\n\np0 (p2 \u2212 p3 )/N\nP\n(\u2212p0 2 + p1 3j=1 pj )/N\n\nq\n2\n2\n2\n(p1 \u2212 p2 ) + (p1 \u2212 p3 ) + (p2 \u2212 p3 )\n\n(26)\n\nze(p) reverses upon spatial reflection (pi \u2192 \u2212pi ) but not time reflection (p0 \u2192 \u2212p0 ), whereas zb(p) shows the opposite\nbehavior, consistent with the known symmetries of the electric and magnetic fields. The ze(p) and zb(p) constitute\nan orthogonal basis from which the projection matrix can also be derived.\nzS \u2297 z S + z S \u2297 zS = 2 (ze(p) \u2297 ze(p) + zb(p) \u2297 zb(p))\n\n(27)\n\nWith the results above we can define a positive helicity spin one field\nei \u03b8\n(0, i b1 + e1 , i b2 + e2 , i b3 + e3 )\n\u03c8+ = \u221a\n2p0\n\n(28)\n\n\f5\nin which the factor ei \u03b8 assimilates the phase freedom of the field.

Although the Gibbs vector formalism is the most frequently encountered depiction of the electromagnetic\nfield, the most compact way to represent the field operators is not by Gibbs bivectors but by spinor bivectors (or,\nmore directly, by elements of a Clifford algebra [22, 25, 26]), which will be presented elsewhere. The time and space\nreflection operators defined by\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\n04 \u221214\n04 14\nRT :=\nand RS :=\n(36)\n14 04\n14 04\nhave action on the operator G\u2202 of (32) given by the inner products RT G\u2202 RT and RS G\u2202 RS respectively, consistent\nwith their character as reflections, not rotations.\nV.\n\nPHASE FREEDOM AND TOPOLOGY\n\nBecause the lengths of the bivectors (14 - 16) are equal, the differences between them constitute variations in\nnormalization that affect the argument but not modulus of a complex quantity, a form of phase freedom that can be\nidentified with the well-studied Berry phase [3, 4, 13], recently reviewed in [14]. The phase has a history dependence\nwhich is easily displayed without reference to circuit as follows.\nIf the order of rotations is reversed for each of the (14 - 16), a different collection of bivectors results. For\nexample, from the pure 1-direction bivector \u03c8\u00b1 we can carry out the rotation \u03c8\u00b1 \u2032 = e\u2212i\u03bb3 S3 e\u2212i\u03bb2 S2 \u03c8\u00b1 where\n\n\f6\np\np\n\u03bb2 = arcsin(\u2212p3 / p21 + p22 + p23 ) and \u03bb3 = arcsin(p2 / p21 + p22 ). In this case the resulting \u03c8\u00b1 \u2032 is poorly defined\nfor motion in the 3-direction, not the 2-direction as in (14). The collection of bivectors under reversal of the rotation\norder then are:\n\u03c8+ \u2192 y3 , \u03b6+ \u2192 y1 , \u03be+ \u2192 y2\n\n(37)\n\nwith the translation to field components\nyj = \u221a\n\n1 \u2212i bj + ej\nq\n(0, i b1 + e1 , i b2 + e2 , i b3 + e3 )\n2p0 b 2 + e 2\nj\n\n(38)\n\nj\n\ndiffering from (23) by a factor of i. Thus we can easily calculate changes in phase without completing a circuit.\nAlternatively, any open path can be turned into at least one closed circuit by joining the endpoints by a geodesic,\nalong which the angle of rotation by parallel transport is zero [16, 17]\nBy rotating from a pure motion in the 1-direction to a motion in an arbitrary direction via the sequence leading to\n(23), and then back to a pure motion in the 1-direction by the reverse of the sequence leading to (38), a rectilinear\npath is inscribed on a sphere, and the regenerated bivector at the close of the loop has the form\np2 p3\n\ne\u00b1i arctan( p0 p1 ) \u03c8\u00b1\n\n(39)\n\nThe simplest interpretation of (39) is that the positive helicity bivector has been rotated by arctan( pp20 pp31 ) and the\nnegative helicity bivector has been rotated by \u2212 arctan( pp02 pp13 ). However if a positive helicity state is rotated about the\naxis of propagation by an amount \u03b3 and a negative helicity state is rotated about the same axis by \u2212\u03b3, the effect of\nrotation is equivalent to a translation in time of the phase of both states by the same amount. In particular, for any\nequally weighted mixture of such states the holonomy angle should be zero. This conclusion would be consistent with\nthe inferred dependence of phase on angular momentum [3, 7, 8], but leads to the prediction that a linearly polarized\nbeam, which has obvious transverse character, should show no holonomy. This is not observed experimentally [6].\nAlthough it might be possible to invoke the influence of optical fiber geometry on rotation of the polarization plane,\nconsiderations based on the orientation of the field with respect to time allow an alternate interpretation.\nThe classical sum of helicity states described in the preceding paragraph is [26] chap. 7\n\u03bc\n\n\u03bc\n\nei p\u03bc x |+i + e\u2212i p\u03bc x |\u2212i\n\n(40)\n\nwhere for avoidance of doubt we can multiply both states by the same modulation envelope, such as a simple Gaussian\nfunctional (2\u03c0\u03c3 2 /p20 )\u22121/4 exp(\u2212(p\u03bc x\u03bc )2 /(4\u03c3 2 )) [26], and confirm that the resulting structure describes a plane wavelet\npropagating forward in time. (40) has no obvious pathologies from a classical perspective. However it does not allow\na Hamiltonian equation that is consistent with all properties of the field, even if the sum is taken to be a direct tensor\naddition, because the derivative with respect to time yields both positive and negative energies and the resulting\ncurrents are then pseudovectors, not vectors. Consistent with this, if (40) is multiplied by a Gaussian modulation\nfunction the Fourier transform of the resulting state is a sum of two momentum amplitude components, one centered\non p and the other on \u2212p. If we require a common orientation for all states in both time and time derivative, we have\na direct sum of the form (32), and the Hamiltonian has the form\n\u0012\n\u0013 \u0012\n\u0013\nH+ 04\n\u03c7j p j\n04\nH=\n=\n(41)\n04 H\u2212\n04 \u2212\u03c7j pj\nwhich has quadruply degenerate eigenvalues of \u00b1p0 . The time evolution of states is given by\n\u0013\n\u0013\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0012 \u2212x H\n\u03bc\n\u03c8+\n\u03c8+\ne 0 +\n04\ni p*x\nei p\u03bc x\ne\n=\n\u2212x0 H\u2212\n\u2212\u03c8\n\u2212\u03c8\n04\ne\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\n(42)\n\nWith this, multiplication of \u03c8+ and \u03c8\u2212 by ei \u03b3 and e\u2212i \u03b3 , respectively, is equivalent to phase translation in opposite\ntime directions, leading to rotation of the plane of polarization. Representing the polarization state by the parameters\nof the Poincar\u00e9 spinor (helicity basis), we have for the positive energy part of the field\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u03bc\n\u03c8+ a+\nei p\u03bc x\n(43)\n\u2212\u03c8\u2212 a\u2212\nwhere a+ and a\u2212 are the annihilation operators for the positive and negative helicity states, respectively. In the\nstandard depiction, the 'north' and 'south' poles of the Poincar\u00e9 sphere are pure + and \u2212 helicity states represented\n\n\f7\nby amplitude weights of cos \u03b8/2 and e\u2212i \u03c6 sin \u03b8/2 respectively, and the equatorial antipodes (front and back) are pure\n'x' and 'y' states. The plane \u03b8 = \u03c0/2 is the plane of linear polarization, and \u03b8 = \u03c0/2, \u03c6 = 0 corresponds to linear\nx axis polarization while \u03b8 = \u03c0/2, \u03c6 = \u03c0 corresponds to linear y axis polarization. From this we can see that the\neffect of multiplication of an equally weighted mixture of positive and negative states (\u03b8 = \u03c0/2) by ei \u03b3 and e\u2212i \u03b3 ,\nrespectively, is equivalent to a rotation of the plane of linear polarization by \u03b3; a corollary is that the phase factors\nof (39) do not have a simple geometric interpretation. With respect to the angular momentum dependence found by\nBerry, we must also conclude that the equally weighted direct sum of time-oriented (1, 0) and (0, 1) representations\ndoes not transform as a state of zero angular momentum under rotations.\nIn the standard spherical coordinates p1 = p0 cos \u03c6 sin \u03b8, p2 = p0 sin \u03c6 sin \u03b8, p3 = p0 cos \u03b8, (39) gives\ne\u00b1i arctan(cos \u03b8 tan \u03c6) \u03c8\u00b1\n\n(44)\n\nand by the Gauss-Bonnet theorem, for a large class of simple loops that enclose an area that can be represented as\nthe union of a countable collection of triangles, the exponent is equal to the area of the spherical surface enclosed\ndivided by the square of the radius of curvature, |p|. For the calculation above this is easily confirmed in the limit\n\u03b8 \u2192 0. The general result can be reached in a direct and elegant way from the properties of the holonomy group and\nthe unitary representation of the massless spin one little group [9].\nReversal of the direction by which the path is traversed leads to reversal of the sign of the exponent. In addition it\ncan easily be seen that for a spin n field, constructed as the outer product of n spin 1 fields, the phase acquired upon\ntraversal of the circuit would be n times the value obtained upon traversal by a spin one field (apply the sequence of\ntransformations to each element of the outer product). The related SU (2) phase value \u00b1 arctan(cos \u03b8 tan \u03c62 ) [27, 28]\nhas been identified with the Pancharatnam phase [19], obtained by rotating the polarization state about a closed path\non the Poincar\u00e9 sphere.\nRotation of the vector solutions of (4) to an arbitrary direction of motion by recapitulation of the steps leading to\n(14 - 16) is simple and yields the same result in all three cases,\n1\n(i p0 , p1 , p2 , p3 )\nzT (p) := \u221a\n2 p0\n\n(45)\n\nthe longitudinal field, with time-like polarization. There is no phase freedom in this case because the solutions\ndescribe polar, as opposed to tangent, vectors; there is correspondingly no quantization known to be associated with\nthe longitudinal field.\nThe prescription for boost transformation of zT differs from that for zS , and as was the case for the zS , the\ntransformation laws for zT and z T are different:\nzT (p\u2032 ) = e \u03ba Ki zT (p) = zT (p)e\u2212\u03ba Ki\n\nz T (p\u2032 ) = e\u2212\u03ba Ki z T (p) = z T (p)e \u03ba Ki\n\n(46)\n\nThe rotation operator is the same for zS and zT (and z S and z T )\nzT (p\u2032 ) = e i\u03ba Sj zT (p) = zT (p)e\u2212i\u03ba Sj\nVI.\n\n(47)\n\nPHASE FREEDOM AND QUANTIZATION\n\nPhase freedom imposes additional constraints on field structure. Because the wave-like behavior of elementary\nparticles is experimentally well-validated there must be some principle that prevents the phase of the field from\nchanging arbitrarily from one space-time coordinate to another. If this were not present all phases could equally\ncoexist at all space-time coordinates \u2013 or equivalently be unpredictable \u2013 and interference phenomena would not be\nobservable. The simplest reconciliation of phase freedom with wave-like behavior is to posit that the phase of a photon\nis determinate, but changes upon rotation from one coordinate system to another in a path-dependent manner. That\nis, that phase is embedded topologically and depends on the rotation history of both the particle and the observer.\nNow imagine that the photon field were not quantized, specifically that the angular momentum could be varied\ncontinuously by some unspecified classical mechanism. The angular momentum in this hypothetical field would\npresumably be represented by an intensive variable, i.e., would be localizable. Since the phase change associated with\nvariation in path orientation depends linearly on angular momentum, frame rotation of a wave train would result\nin a phase change proportional to the total angular momentum accumulated at the point of measurement, in turn\ndependent on the length of the electromagnetic impulse measured. We could formalize this by saying the field would\nhave an additional multiplicative factor ei x0 \u03b8 where \u03b8 is proportional to the solid angle of the circuit traversed (in the\ncase of a closed loop). However this would be equivalent to a change in energy of the system by \u2212~ \u03b8. If this were\n\n\f8\nnot sufficiently disquieting, by the analysis above, the plane of linear polarization would rotate with time. Although\nit has been argued [11, 12] that the rotation of the plane of polarization of linearly polarized light injected into a\nhelically wound optical fiber [5, 6] represents a classical effect, the necessity for a discrete angular momentum, and\nhence field quantization, appears unavoidable.\nVII.\n\nCURRENT AND GRADIENT OPERATORS\n\nFor massive and massless spin 1/2 fields, there exist well behaved four-vector current operators whose expectations,\ntypically written \u03c8\u03b3\u03bc \u03c8 and \u03c8 \u2020 \u03c3\u03bc \u03c8, respectively, yield the predicted particle flux. If these did not exist there would be\ndifficulties accounting for conservation of charge. Because photons do not bear charge, there is no obvious necessity for\na conserved current, but there are related requirements to preserve conservation of energy-momentum. The standard\ndefinition of the quantized quantity corresponding to the Poynting energy-momentum flux vector is an expectation\nover a field and the time derivative of its adjoint:\nZ\np \u03bc = \u2212 d3 x\u0226(\u2212) (x, t)\u2202/\u2202x \u03bc A(+) (x, t)\n(48)\nThis has been formally justified in the context of the canonical quantization of boson fields, which are thought to\nhave canonical adjoints that are time derivatives of the ordinary adjoints; the canonical adjoint of spinor fields is the\nordinary adjoint. Depending on one's perspective, either quantization, boson or fermion, could appear unnatural. For\nexample, in the fermion case the canonical momentum is the adjoint field.\nFrom field equations of the form \u2202\u03bc \u03c7 \u03bc \u03c8+ = 0, it would be reasonable to attempt to identify the \u03c7j with current\nR\noperators, yielding operator expectations of the form d3 x [\u03c8+ \u2020 \u03c7 \u03bc \u03c8+ ] = j \u03bc , while allowing translation operator\nR 3\nexpectations to be formed in the usual way: d x [\u03c8+ \u2020 \u2202\u03bc \u03c8+ ] = p \u03bc . Although such a representation can be realized,\nthe current operators transform not as vectors but as tensors, because the fields themselves are tensors.\nOur first task is to introduce an adjoint field as a formal conjugate, written in terms of the electric and magnetic\namplitudes as\ne\u2212i \u03b8\n\u03c8+ \u2020 = \u221a\n(0, \u2212i b1 \u2020 + e1 \u2020 , \u2212i b2 \u2020 + e2 \u2020 , \u2212i b3\u2020 + e3 \u2020 )\n2p0\n\n(49)\n\nIn the presence of interactions the adjoint field is an independent quantity and by convention labels the exiting particle.\nThe momentum function conjugates corresponding to this field satisfy the adjoint equation z(p)p \u03bc \u03c7\u03bc = 0 as well as\nthe contravariant (negative helicity) equation p \u03bc \u03c7 \u03bc z(p) = 0. The latter correspond to the Maxwell equations\ne\u2212i \u03b8\ne\u2212i \u03b8\n= (i\u03c1\u2020 , j\u2020 ) \u221a\n\u2202 \u03bc \u03c7 \u03bc \u03c8+ \u2020 = (\u2207 * b\u2020 + i\u2207 * e\u2020 , \u2212\u22020 e\u2020 + \u2207 \u00d7 b\u2020 + i(\u22020 b\u2020 + \u2207 \u00d7 e\u2020 )) \u221a\n2p0\n2p0\n\n(50)\n\nwhere we have superscripted the exiting current to signify its possibly different structure from that associated with\nthe entering field.\nThe Poynting currents for the field can be calculated as elements of the symmetrical tensor formed from the field\nand adjoint, expressed in components as\n\u03c8\u00b1 \u2020 \u03bb \u03c7 \u03b1 \u03bb\u03bc \u03c7\u03b2\u03bc\u03bd \u03c8\u00b1 \u03bd\nThe currents formed from the amplitudes can be written\n\u0011\u0011\n\u0010\n\u0010\n\u03c8\u00b1 \u2020 \u03c7 0 \u03c7 i \u03c8\u00b1 = \u03c8\u00b1 \u2020 \u03c7 i \u03c8\u00b1 = \u00b1\u01ebij k ej \u2020 bk \u2212 bj \u2020 ek \u2213 i bj \u2020 bk + ej \u2020 ek /(2p0 )\n\n(51)\n\n(52)\n\nand\n\u03c8\u00b1 \u2020 \u03c7 0 \u03c7 0 \u03c8\u00b1 = (bj \u2020 bj + ej \u2020 ej \u00b1 i (ej \u2020 bj \u2212 bj \u2020 ej ))/(2p0 )\n\n(53)\n\nThe spatial elements of the stress-energy tensor are\n\u03c8\u00b1 \u2020 \u03c7 l \u03c7 m \u03c8\u00b1 = \u03b4lm (bj \u2020 bj + ej \u2020 ej \u00b1 i (ej \u2020 bj \u2212 bj \u2020 ej ))\n\n\u2212(bl \u2020 bm + bm \u2020 bl + el \u2020 em + em \u2020 el \u00b1 i(el \u2020 bm \u2212 bm \u2020 el + em \u2020 bl \u2212 bl \u2020 em ))\n\n(54)\n\n\f9\nIn the absence of interaction the field component operators bi \u2020 , ej etc., must form Hermitian products (i.e., bi \u2020 ej =\nej bi ) to insure that the momenta, etc., are real. With this the imaginary terms in (52-54) vanish and\n\u0001\n\u03c8\u00b1 \u2020 \u03c7 i \u03c8\u00b1 = \u00b1\u01ebij k ej \u2020 bk \u2212 ek \u2020 bj /(2p0 )\n(55)\n\u2020\n\nand\n\n\u03c8\u00b1 \u2020 \u03c7 0 \u03c8\u00b1 = (bj \u2020 bj + ej \u2020 ej )/(2p0 )\n\n(56)\n\nwhich reduce to the classical expressions. The Hermiticity constraint does not apply in the presence of interactions,\nas the incoming and outgoing fields have different energy-momentum structures.\nIn the absence of interaction the current bilinears generated from the momentum functions of the fields and adjoints\nhave the properties of a generalized velocity, i.e.\nz T (p) \u03c7 \u03bc zT (p) = z S (p) \u03c7 \u03bc zS (p) = p \u03bc /p0\n\n(57)\n\nalthough it should be kept in mind that in the case of the zS , the currents are components of a tensor, not a vector.\nFor example the full relation for the stress-energy tensor is\nz S (p) \u03c7 \u03b1 \u03bb\u03bc \u03c7\u03b2\u03bc\u03bd zS (p) = p \u03b1 p \u03b2 /p20\n\n(58)\n\nand the action of the boost operator on the currents is a tensor reflection,\nj \u03bc \u2032 = \u03c8\u2020 e \u03ba S \u03c7 \u03bc e \u03ba S \u03c8\n\n(59)\n\nwhereas the action of the rotation operator is a tensor rotation\nj \u03bc \u2032 = \u03c8 \u2020 e\u2212i \u03ba S \u03c7 \u03bc e i \u03ba S \u03c8\n\n(60)\n\nThe boost operation is a reflection because the current operator corresponding to the time dimension is a scalar; if it\nwere a vector element (the usual case) the boost operation would be a rotation.\nThe field expectation of translation operators is, by most definitions, computed over the scalar part of the field. In\nthe case of a scalar particle, there is no current operator known apart from the translation operator, and the definition\n\u2212i\np =\n2\n\u03bc\n\nZ\n\nd3 x : [\u03c8+ \u2020 \u2202\u03bc \u03c8+ \u2212 \u03c8+ \u2202\u03bc \u03c8+ \u2020 ] :\n\n(61)\n\nwhere the colons denote normal ordering of creation and annihilation operators, can be identified with the operator\nexpectation. This definition extends to both spinor and bivector fields, and to higher order fields for which the adjoint\ncan be identified as the field quantity that yields a probability density upon contraction with the field.\nVIII.\n\nORTHOGONALITY RELATIONS\n\nThe zT and zS are orthonormal with respect to inner product (with the application of the energy-momentum\nconstraint p\u03bc p \u03bc = 0):\nz T zT = z S zS = 1\nz T zS = z S zT = 0\n\n(62)\n\nand the electric and magnetic amplitudes in the transverse representation have the additional normalization and\northogonality properties (with the energy-momentum constraint)\nze(p) zb(p) = 0\nzT (p) ze(p) = zT (p) zb(p) = 0\nze(p) ze(p) = zb(p) zb(p) = 1/2\n\n(63)\n\nconsistent with the idea that an orthogonal basis can be formed from vectors parallel to the momentum, the electrical\nfield and the magnetic field, and that the electric and magnetic components of a source-free simple field contribute\nequally to the energy density of the field.\n\n\f10\nIX.\n\nPROJECTION OPERATORS\n\nProjection of positive and negative energy states requires an idempotent operator, usually formed\nP as a sum over\n(orthogonal) spin states of the normalized outer product of basis vectors and their adjoints, P = \u03c3 \u03c8 \u2297 \u03c8 \u2020 . In the\nrepresentation developed here the sum is not over spin states but rather longitudinal and transverse components.\nzS \u2297 z S = \u03b4i j /2 \u2212 pi pj /2p0 2 \u2212 i\u01ebi j k pk /2p0 1 \u2264 i, j \u2264 3\n=\n0\notherwise\n\n(64)\n\nThe spatial components of zT \u2297 z T are pi pj /2p0 2 , leading to\nP+ = zT \u2297 z T + zS \u2297 z S =\n\nP\u2212 = z T \u2297 zT + z S \u2297 zS =\n\np \u03bc\u03c7 \u03bc\n2p0\n\n(65)\n\n\u2212p \u03bc \u03c7\u03bc\n2p0\n\n(66)\n\nThese have the required properties P\u00b1 P\u00b1 = P\u00b1 and P\u00b1 P\u2213 = 0. Also P+ z = z; P\u2212 z = z; P+ z = P\u2212 z = 0.\nBecause the negative energy solutions are indistinguishable from lefthanded solutions in the case of the transverse\nfield, these operators also project out spin states. The structure of the projection operators illustrates the principle\nthat both transverse and longitudinal contributions must be included to form a complete description of the field. That\nboth contributions are required is also implicit in the description of the Maxwell equations.\nX.\n\nCONNECTION WITH OTHER FORMALISMS\n\nIn some treatments the relation \u2212\u2202A/\u2202t = E (in radiation gauge) is taken to justify the representation of the\nphoton in terms of a quantized electric field\nr\nXZ \u221e\np0 \u03bc\n\u03bc\n\u22123/2\n3\nE (x) = (2\u03c0)\nd p\n[e (p, \u03c3)a(p, \u03c3)eipx + e\u03bc\u2217 (p, \u03c3)a\u2020 (p, \u03c3)e\u2212ipx ]\n(67)\n2\n\u2212\u221e\n\u03c3\nin which the polarization vectors e\u03bc (p, \u03c3) are the same as those used to describe the vector potential. The magnetic\namplitudes are given by\nr\nXZ \u221e\n(p \u00d7 e(p, \u03c3))\u03bc\u2217 \u2020\np0 (p \u00d7 e(p, \u03c3)) \u03bc\n\u03bc\n\u22123/2\n3\na(p, \u03c3)eipx +\na (p, \u03c3)e\u2212ipx ]\n(68)\n[\nH (x) = (2\u03c0)\nd p\n2\np\np\n0\n0\n\u2212\u221e\n\u03c3\nThis depiction inherits some of the difficulties of the vector potential representation. The electromagnetic field\ntransforms not as a vector (46) but as a tensor (33); the polarization bivectors e(p, \u03c3) describe the complex sum of\nelectric and magnetic fields, not the individual fields in isolation; and the field conjugates transform by different laws\nand obey distinct field equations.\nThe approach taken in this work appears to be most closely related to that of Bialynicki-Birula and BialynickaBirula [7] who have emphasized the role of the Poincar\u00e9 group in determining the structure of the fields. A gauge\ndependent covariant derivative operator does not feature in this analysis, however \u2013 the comparable action is fulfilled\nby operator inner products of the form (12-13) in the momentum representation.\nXI.\n\nMODULATION ENVELOPE TERMS\n\nA vector potential with current given by (48), and a bivector field with current based on (52) or (61) can be\ndistinguished by the presence or absence of terms dependentR on the modulation envelope. Introducing the generic\nreal envelope functional f (p\u03bc x \u03bc ), subject to the constraint f 2 d3 x = 1 we note that, as in the classical case [26],\n\u03bc\n\u03c8 = f (p\u03bc x \u03bc )eip\u03bc x is a solution of the wave equation \u2202 \u03bc \u2202\u03bc \u03c8 = 0. Taking a pure polarization state, for example\npure positive helicity light propagating in the 1-direction in a discrete single mode with wavenumber k, the vector\npotential wavelet\nA(x \u03bc ) =\n\n\u03bc\n\u03bc\nf (k\u03bc x \u03bc )\n\u221a\n( e(k, \u03c3)eik\u03bc x ak + e(k, \u03c3)\u2217 e\u2212ik\u03bc x ak \u2020 := A+ (x \u03bc ) + A\u2212 (x \u03bc )\n2\u03c9k\n\n(69)\n\n\f11\ngives, by (48), a field momentum\nZ\nZ\nZ\n2\n\u03bc\n3\n\u2212\n\u03bd\n\u03bc +\n\u03bd\n\u2020\n3\n\u03bc 2\n\u20322\n\u2020\n\u03bc\nkA = \u2212 d x[\u22020 A (x )\u2202 A (x )] = ak ak d x[k (f + f )] = ak ak k (1 + d3 x[f \u2032 ])\n\n(70)\n\nwhereas the bivector field wavelet\n\u03bc\n\n\u03bc\n\nB(x \u03bc ) = f (k\u03bc x \u03bc )(e(k, \u03c3)eik\u03bc x ak \u2295 e(k, \u03c3)\u2217 e\u2212ik\u03bc x ak \u2020 := B + (x \u03bc ) \u2295 B \u2212 (x \u03bc )\ngives, by (61), a field momentum\nZ\n\u2212i\nd3 x : [B \u2212 (x \u03bd )\u2202 \u03bc B + (x \u03bd ) \u2212 B + (x \u03bd )\u2202 \u03bc B \u2212 (x \u03bd )] : = ak \u2020 ak k \u03bc\nkB \u03bc =\n2\n\n(71)\n\n(72)\n\nThe difference between (72) and (70) is the spatial integral of a squared functional derivative. To see what this\ncontributes we evaluate it for the case of the normalized plane wavelet envelope\nf (k\u03bc x \u03bc ) = (2\u03c0\u03c3 2 /k02 )\u22121/4 e\u2212\n\n(k\u03bc x \u03bc )2\n4\u03c32\n\n(73)\n\nspecialized to a pure 1-direction motion (integration over the 2- and 3- directions is taken to give unity). In this case\nthe Fourier transform in the two spatial variables x0 , x1 of the positive frequency part of the field gives\nZ\n\u2212\u03c32 (p1 \u2212k1 )2\n\u03bc\n2\nk1\n\u03b4(p0 \u2212 p1 )\n(74)\nf (k\u03bc x \u03bc )eik\u03bc x e\u2212ip0 x0 +p1 x1 dx0 dx1 = (8\u03c0\u03c3 2 /k02 )1/4 e\nand the squared derivative term in (70) gives\nZ\nZ\n1\nk0 (k0 x0 \u2212 k1 x1 )2 \u2212 (k0 x0 \u2212k21 x1 )2\n\u20322\n2\u03c3\n]= 2\ndx1 [f ] = dx1 [\ne\n5/2\n5\n1/2\n4\u03c3\n2 \u03c3 \u03c0\n\n(75)\n\nso that the current (70) is\nkA \u03bc = ak \u2020 ak k \u03bc (1 +\n\n1\n)\n4\u03c3 2\n\n(76)\n\nAn energy-momentum contribution that increases with decreasing width of the modulation envelope should be demonstrable experimentally.\nXII.\n\nCURRENTS FROM FIELD SUPERPOSITION\n\nAnother setting that allows discrimination of vector and bivector fields is the prediction of currents arising from field\nsuperposition. Consider for instance a field that is constituted by the division and redirection of two components. Let\nthe two components be directed toward each other symmetrically after some experimental manipulation to separate\nthem, and for convenience, let them be in the same polarization state. If the envelope functional of one component\nis f (k\u03bc x \u03bc ) and of the other is g(\u2212k \u03bc x \u03bc ) (i.e., they are directed with equal and opposite momenta, evolving in the\nsame time direction), and if we set the time of intersection of the fields to be the origin, the positive frequency part\nof the bivector superimposed field will be\n\u03bc\n\nB + (x \u03bc ) = f (k\u03bc x \u03bc )e(k, \u03c3)eik\u03bc x ak + g(\u2212k \u03bc x \u03bc )e(k, \u03c3)e\u2212ik\n\n\u03bc\n\nx\u03bc\n\nak\n\n(77)\n\nin which the fields share the same creation and annihilation operators because they are derived from a single source.\nUsing (77) and (61) we find for the spatial components of the momenta\nZ\n< kB j >= ak \u2020 ak k j d3 x[f 2 \u2212 g 2 + 2Sin(2 p * x)(f \u2032 g + g \u2032 f )]\n(78)\nwhere the subtraction of squared functionals reflects their opposite contributions to total momentum; for the energy\nwe find\nZ\n0\n\u2020\n0\n< kB >= ak ak k\nd3 x[f 2 + g 2 + 2f g Cos(2 p * x) + 2Sin(2 p * x)(f \u2032 g \u2212 g \u2032 f )]\n(79)\n\n\f12\nso the energy is given by the sum of the energies of the components, as expected. For the case of a pure 1-direction\nmotion, with a Gaussian envelope of the form (73) for f , and with g given by the same formula with opposite sign of\np1 , the interference term in (78) is given by\n1\n\n\u221a\n2 \u03c0 \u03c32\n\ne\u2212\n\np0 2 x0 2 +p1 2 x1 2\n2 \u03c32\n\n\u03c32\n\np20 x0 sin(2 p1 x1 )\n\nAnalysis of the currents by the vector potential treatment gives\nZ\n2\n2\n\u03bc\n\u2020\n\u03bc\n< kA >= ak ak k\nd3 x[f 2 + f \u2032 \u2212 g 2 \u2212 g \u2032 + 2 i Sin(2p * x)(f \u2032 g + f g \u2032 ) + 2 i Cos(2p * x)(f g \u2032 \u2212 f \u2032 g)]\n\n(80)\n\n(81)\n\nhence in addition to the squared functional derivatives encountered in (70) there are imaginary interference terms.\nI thank Jeremy Gunawardena, Tom McCauley, and Rebecca Ward for suggestions and encouragement of this work.\n\n[1]\n[2]\n[3]\n[4]\n[5]\n[6]\n[7]\n[8]\n[9]\n[10]\n[11]\n[12]\n[13]\n[14]\n[15]\n[16]\n[17]\n[18]\n[19]\n[20]\n[21]\n[22]\n[23]\n[24]\n[25]\n[26]\n[27]\n[28]\n\nE.
