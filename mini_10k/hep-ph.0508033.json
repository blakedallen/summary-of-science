Colangelo and R. Ferrandes\nIstituto Nazionale di Fisica Nucleare, Sezione di Bari, Italy\nDipartimento di Fisica, Universit\u00e1 di Bari, Italy\n\nAbstract\n0\nThe widths of a class of two-body B s decays induced by b \u2192 c\u016bd and b \u2192\nc\u016bs transitions are determined in a model-independent way, using SU(3)F\nsymmetry and existing information on B\u0304 \u2192 D(s) P and B\u0304 \u2192 D(s) V decays,\nwith P and V a light pseudoscalar or vector meson. The results are relevant for\nthe Bs physics programmes at the hadron colliders and at the e+ e\u2212 factories\nrunning at the peak of \u03a5(5S).\n\n\fIn the next few years an intense Bs physics programme will be pursued at the hadron\ncolliders, the Fermilab Tevatron and the CERN LHC, and at the e+ e\u2212 factories running at\n\u03a5(5S). The programme includes precise determination of the Bs \u2212 B s mixing parameters\nand search for CP violating asymmetries in Bs decays, with the aim of providing new\ntests of the Standard Model (SM) and searching for physics beyond SM. The analysis of\nrare Bs transitions is another aspect of the research programme, with the same aim of\nlooking for deviations from SM expectations.\nThe knowledge of non leptonic Bs decay rates is of prime importance for working out\nthe research programme. For example, Bs \u2212 B s mixing can be studied using Bs twobody hadronic decay modes in addition to semileptonic modes. It is noticeable that the\nwidths of a set of two-body transitions can be predicted in a model independent way,\nusing the symmetries of QCD and available information on B decays. We are referring\n\nin particular to a class of decay modes induced by the quark transitions b \u2192 c\u016bd and\nb \u2192 c\u016bs, for example those collected in Table 1. The key observation is that the various\n0\n\nTable 1: SU(3) decay amplitudes for B s \u2192 D(s) P decays, with P a light pseudoscalar\nmeson.

The transition in\nthe SU(3) singlet \u03b70 involves another amplitude D in principle not related to the previous\n\nones. Notice that the identification of the different amplitudes is not graphical, it is based\non SU(3) [1]. Since B \u2192 DP decays induced by the quark processes b \u2192 cuq (q = d or s)\ninvolve a weak Hamiltonian transforming as a flavor octet, using de Swart's notation T\u03bd(\u03bc)\nfor the \u03bd = (Y, I, I3 ) component of an irreducible tensor operator of rank (\u03bc) [2], one can\n\u2217 (8)\n\u2217 (8)\nwrite: HW = Vcb Vud\nT0 1 \u22121 + VcbVus\nT\u22121 1 \u2212 1 . When combined with the initial B mesons,\n2\n\n2\n\nwhich form a (3\u2217 )-representation of SU(3), this leads to (3\u2217 ), (6) and (15\u2217 ) representations.\nThese are also the representations formed by the combination of the final octet light\npseudoscalar meson and triplet D meson. Therefore, using the Wigner-Eckart theorem\nfor SU(3), the decay amplitudes can be written as linear combinations of three reduced\n\u2217\namplitudes h\u03c6(\u03bc) |T (8) |B (3 ) i, with \u03bc = 3\u2217 , 6, 15\u2217, which are independent of the quantum\n\nnumbers Y, I, I3 of the Hamiltonian and the initial and final states. By appropriate linear\ncombinations of the three reduced amplitudes one can obtain a correspondence with the\nthree topological diagrams of the various decay modes. The combinations correspond\nto C, T and E in Table 1, i.e. the color suppressed, color enhanced and W-exchange\ndiagrams, respectively. The SU(3) representation for B decays is reported in Table 2.\n\nTable 2: SU(3) parameterization of B\u0304 \u2192 D(s) P decay amplitudes induced by the b \u2192 c\u016bd\nand b \u2192 c\u016bs transitions, together with the experimental results reported by the Particle\nData Group [3].\ndecay mode\nB \u2212 \u2192 D0\u03c0\u2212\n0\nB \u2192 D0 \u03c00\n0\n\nB \u2192 D+ \u03c0\u2212\n0\nB \u2192 Ds+ K \u2212\n0\nB \u2192 D 0 \u03b78\n0\n\nB \u2192 D 0 \u03b70\n0\nB \u2192 D0 \u03b7\n0\nB \u2192 D0 \u03b7\u2032\nB \u2212 \u2192 D0K \u2212\n0\n0\nB \u2192 D0 K\n0\nB \u2192 D+ K \u2212\n\namplitude\n\u2217\nVud\nVcb (C + T )\n\u221a1 V \u2217 Vcb (C \u2212 E)\n2 ud\n\u2217\nVud\nVcb (T + E)\n\u2217\nVud\nVcb E\n1\n\u2217\n\u2212 \u221a6 Vud Vcb (C + E)\n\u2217\nVud\nVcb D\n\n\u2217\nVus\nVcb (C + T )\n\u2217\nVus\nVcb C\n\u2217\nVus Vcb T\n\n3\n\nBR [3]\n(4.98 \u00b1 0.29) \u00d7 10\u22123\n(2.91 \u00b1 0.28) \u00d7 10\u22124\n(2.76 \u00b1 0.25) \u00d7 10\u22123\n(3.8 \u00b1 1.3) \u00d7 10\u22125\n\n(2.2 \u00b1 0.5) \u00d7 10\u22124\n(1.7 \u00b1 0.4) \u00d7 10\u22124\n(3.7 \u00b1 0.6) \u00d7 10\u22124\n(5.0 \u00b1 1.4) \u00d7 10\u22125\n(2.0 \u00b1 0.6) \u00d7 10\u22124\n\n\fConsidering Table 2 one realizes that the three B\u0304 \u2192 DK experimental rates could\nallow to obtain |T |, |C| and the phase difference \u03b4C \u2212 \u03b4T . This was already observed in\n\n[4], and can be recast in the determination of the two independent isospin amplitudes\n\u221a\nA1 and A0 for I = 1 and I = 0 isospin DK final states: A(B \u2212 \u2192 D 0 K \u2212 ) = 2A1 ,\nA(B\u0304 0 \u2192 D + K \u2212 ) = \u221a12 (A1 + A0 ) A(B\u0304 0 \u2192 D 0 K\u0304 0 ) = \u221a12 (A1 \u2212 A0 ).

Due to the quality of the experimental data and to the correlation between |A0 /A1 |\nand \u03b40 \u2212\u03b41 , the allowed region is not tightly constrained, in particular the phase difference\ncould be zero.\n\nWe pause here, since we can elaborate once more about factorization approximations\nsometimes adopted for computing non leptonic decays, in this case for B mesons [5].\nIn fig.1 we have shown the predictions by, e.g., naive factorization, where the decay\namplitudes are written in terms of K and D meson leptonic constants fK and fD , and\n4\n\n\f\u2217\nthe B \u2192 D and B \u2192 K form factors F0 : A(B\u0304 0 \u2192 D + K \u2212 )F = i G\u221aF2 VcbVus\na1 (m2B \u2212\n\u2217\na2 (m2B \u2212 m2K )fD F0B\u2192K (m2D ). The\nm2D )fK F0B\u2192D (m2K ) and A(B\u0304 0 \u2192 D 0 K\u0304 0 )F = i G\u221aF2 VcbVus\n\nresult of this approach corresponds to vanishing phase difference; using a1 = c1 + c2 /3 and\na2 = c2 +c1 /3, with c1 and c2 the Wilson coefficients appearing in the effective hamiltonian\ninducing the decays (for their numerical values we quote a1 = (1.036, 1.017, 1.025) and\n\na2 = (0.073, 0.175, 0.140) at LO and at NLO (in NDR and HV renormalization schemes)\naccuracy, respectively [6]) we obtain results corresponding to the dots along the horizontal\naxis in fig. 1, which do not belong to the region permitted by experimental data at 95%\nCL. In generalized factorization, where a1 and a2 are considered as parameters, the phase\ndifference is constrained to be zero, too. This is allowed by the experimental data on\nthese three channels, but excluded if one considers all channels, as we shall see below.\nComing to bounding the decay amplitudes, the four B\u0304 \u2192 D\u03c0 and B\u0304 \u2192 Ds K decay\n\nrates cannot determine C, T , E and their phase differences [7]. B\u0304 \u2192 Ds K only fixes the\nmodulus of E, which is not small at odds with the expectations by factorization, where W exchange processes are suppressed by ratios of decay constants and form factors and are\nusually considered to be negligible. Moreover, the presence of E does not allow to directly\nrelate color favoured T or color suppressed C decay amplitudes in D\u03c0 and DK final\nstates. What can be done, however, is to use all the information on B\u0304 \u2192 D\u03c0, Ds K and\n\nDK (7 experimental data) to determine T , C and E (5 parameters). A similar attitude\nhas been recently adopted in [8]. Noticeably, the combined experimental information\nis enough accurate to tightly determine the ranges of variation for all these quantities.\nIn fig. 2 we have depicted the allowed regions in the C/T and E/T planes, obtained\nfixing the other variables to their fitted values, with the corresponding confidence levels.\nIt is worth noticing that the phase differences between the various amplitudes are close\nto be maximal; this signals again deviation from naive (or generalized) factorization,\n\nprovides contraints to QCD-based approaches proposed to evaluate non leptonic B decay\namplitudes [9, 10, 11] and points towards sizeable long-distance effects in C and E [12, 13].\nTo obtain the amplitudes we have fixed the ratio |Vus /Vud | to the experimental result:\n\n|Vus /Vud | = 0.226 \u00b1 0.003, and we have taken into account the phase space correction\ndue to pDK , pD\u03c0 = 2306 MeV and pDs K \u2212 = 2242 MeV. We obtain | CT | = 0.53 \u00b1 0.10,\n| ET | = 0.115 \u00b1 0.020, \u03b4C \u2212 \u03b4T = (76 \u00b1 12)\u25e6 and \u03b4E \u2212 \u03b4T = (112 \u00b1 46)\u25e6 . We have to\nmention that the accuracy of the fit is not particularly high since \u03c72 /dof = 2.3, i.e. a fit\n\nprobability of 10%. This is entirely due to a single entry in Table 2, the branching fraction\nof B \u2212 \u2192 D 0 K \u2212 . We have reported the PDG value corresponding to the average of two\n\nmeasurements, by CLEO ((2.92\u00b10.84\u00b10.28)\u00d710\u22124) and Belle ((4.19\u00b10.57\u00b10.40)\u00d710\u22124)\n5\n\n\f100\n\n\u2206E -\u2206T HdegreesL\n\n\u2206C -\u2206T HdegreesL\n\n175\n\n80\n60\n\n150\n125\n100\n75\n50\n25\n\n40\n\n0\n0.4\n\n0.45\n\n0.5 0.55\n\u00c8C\u0090T\u00c8\n\n0.6\n\n0\n\n0.05\n\n0.1 0.15\n\u00c8E\u0090T\u00c8\n\n0.2\n\nFigure 2: Ratios of SU(3) amplitudes obtained from data in Table 2.

The fit favours a smaller value:\nfor example, using the CLEO result the \u03c72 /dof drops to 0.3 without sensibly modifying\nthe results.\nWith the results for the amplitudes we can determine a number of Bs decay rates,\nand the predictions are collected in Table 1. The uncertainties in the predicted rates are\n0\nsmall; in particular, the W -exchange induced processes B s \u2192 D + \u03c0 \u2212 , D 0\u03c0 0 are precisely\n\nestimated [14].\nConsidering the decays with \u03b7 or \u03b7 \u2032 in the final state, they involve the amplitude D\ncorresponding to the transition in a SU(3) singlet \u03b70 , and the \u03b7 \u2212 \u03b7 \u2032 mixing angle \u03b8 (in a\none angle mixing scheme):\n\n1\nD\n0\nA(B \u2192 D 0 \u03b7) = cos \u03b8[\u2212 \u221a (C + E)] \u2212 sin \u03b8 \u221a\n6\n3\nD\n1\n0\nA(B \u2192 D 0 \u03b7 \u2032 ) = sin \u03b8[\u2212 \u221a (C + E)] + cos \u03b8 \u221a .\n6\n3\n\n(1)\n\n| = 0.41 \u00b1 0.11\nIf we use the value \u03b8 = \u221215.40 for the mixing angle [15], we obtain | D\nT\n\nwithout sensibly constraining the D \u2212 T phase difference, \u03b4D \u2212 \u03b4T = \u2212(25 \u00b1 51)\u25e6 . Corre0\nsponding B s decay rates are predicted consequently.\nThe key of the success of the programme of predicting Bs decay rates is the small\nnumber of amplitudes in comparison to the available data, a feature which is not common\n6\n\n\fto all processes. Considering b \u2192 c\u016bd(s) induced transitions, one could look at the case\nof one light vector meson in the final state, with the same SU(3) decomposition reported\nin Tables 1, 2 (we denote by a prime the amplitudes involved in this case). B decay\ndata are collected in Table 3. The difference with respect to the previous case is that the\nW-exchange mode B\u0304 0 \u2192 Ds+ K \u2217\u2212 has not been observed, yet, therefore the E \u2032 amplitude\n\nis poorly determined considering only the other modes. Taking into account phase space\n\u2032\ncorrections due to pD\u03c1 = 2235 MeV and pDK \u2217 = 2211 MeV, we obtain | CT \u2032 | = 0.36 \u00b1 0.10,\n\u2032\n\n| ET \u2032 | = 0.29 \u00b1 0.37, \u03b4C \u2032 \u2212 \u03b4T \u2032 = (48 \u00b1 67)\u25e6 and \u03b4E \u2032 \u2212 \u03b4T \u2032 = (96 \u00b1 56)\u25e6 , with a fit probability\nof 85%. The allowed region in the C \u2032 /T \u2032 plane, fixing all the other variables to their fitted\nvalues, is depicted in fig.3. In this case the phase difference \u03b4C \u2032 \u2212 \u03b4T \u2032 can vanish.\n\nThe\n\n\u2206C' -\u2206T' HdegreesL\n\n175\n150\n125\n100\n75\n50\n25\n0\n0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6\n\u00c8C'\u0090T'\u00c8\n\nFigure 3: Ratio of C \u2032 and T \u2032 amplitudes for B\u0304 \u2192 DV transitions. The contours correspond to the same confidence level as in fig. 2; the dot shows the result of the fit.\n0\n\npredictions for B s decay rates are collected in Table 3: as anticipated, the accuracy is not\nhigh for W \u2212exchange induced decays. On the other hand, the prediction for the rate of\n0\n\n0\n\nB \u2192 Ds K \u2217\u2212 : B(B \u2192 Ds K \u2217\u2212 ) = (1 \u00b1 5) \u00d7 10\u22124, is compatible with the upper bound in\nTable 3.\nConsidering other decay modes induced by the same quark transitions, namely B\u0304 \u2192\n\u2217\nand B\u0304 \u2192 D(s)\nV decays, the present experimental data are not precise enough to\n\n\u2217\nD(s)\nP\n\nsensibly constrain the independent amplitudes and to provide stringent predictions for\nBs .

Those effects are not universal, and in general cannot be reduced to\nwell defined and predictable patterns without new assumptions. Their parametrization\nwould introduce additional quantities [16] that at present cannot be sensibly bounded\nsince their effects seem to be smaller than the experimental uncertainties. Therefore they\ncan be neglected until the experimental errors remain at the present level. It will be\ninteresting to investigate their role when the Bs decay rates will be measured and more\nprecise B branching fractions will be available.\n\nAcnowledgments\nWe thank F.
