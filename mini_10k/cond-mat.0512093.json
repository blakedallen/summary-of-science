Within a\nflux line description, the combined effects of high temperature, strong anisotropy, short coherence length and large\npenetration depth promotes a large flux liquid domain in\nthe vicinity of the upper critical-field line, Hc2 (T ). Such a\nliquid is characterized by the loss of the phase coherence,\nwhich is otherwise present in the ordered Abrikosov vortex lattice;1,2 the first order flux melting transition (or\nthe irreversibility line, in the case of disordered materials) replaces the usual superconducting transition line,\nwhich is no longer characterized by the occurrence of zero\nresistivity.\nThe absence of a genuine transition opens the possibility to describe the 'normal' state as a region of fluctuating\nvortices. However, in the absence of local pairing, regular vortices do not survive above Tc . The observation of\na large Nernst effect well above Tc , combined with a diamagnetic magnetization, has lent support to the idea that\nonly the phase coherence is broken at the superconducting transition, while the condensate amplitude remains\nfinite.3,4 In the vortex description, this means that the\nvortex-core energy remains essentially unchanged at the\nsuperconducting transition and that it is unusually small.\nTherefore, the usual mirror in the descriptions of the fluctuating superconducting state and of the fluctuating normal state is broken: this results from the observation of\nan upper critical field which remains constant through\nTc .6,7\nWithin this picture, the superconducting transition\nline obtained from the saturation of the resistivity to a\nvalue close to the normal state one marks the loss of\nphase coherence. It roughly coincides with the peak in\nthe Nernst effect ('ridge line') and it is strikingly different\nfrom the one inferred from the vanishing of the Nernst\neffect related the order parameter amplitude.6,7 Such a\npicture does not, however, completely clarify the superconducting phase diagram. In particular, there is in the\ncase of Bi-based cuprates a large temperature interval\nbetween the onset for the Nernst signal and the temperature for its maximum and one may wonder whether a\nthermodynamic transition line for the loss of the phase\n\nstiffness exists, or whether the latter is gradually lost in\nthis temperature interval.\nMost of the speculations concerning the nature of the\nresistivity line were brought by the early observation of\nits pronounced upwards curvature for several cuprates\nand organic materials (see Ref. 8 and refs therein). Experimentally, the reality of this curvature in the Hc2 (T )\nline is discussed. It was soon pointed out that this might\nresult from an incorrect determination of the upper critical field from resistive measurements. The in-plane resistive transition might yield a considerably lower value\nthan the true upper critical field, due to the existence of\na large flux liquid regime above the melting line: zeroresistivity measurement would actually detect the irreversibility line (with an upward curvature) instead of\nHc2 . Indeed, in Refs. 9 and 10, it was found that, for\nstrongly overdoped and slightly underdoped Bi-2201 single crystals, a linear Hc2 (T ) line is obtained, provided\nthat the resistive criterion is chosen close to the normal state resistivity value. Existence of similar thermally activated motion of pancake vortices may be opposed to the critical field measurements from out-of-plane\nresistivity.11 However, analysis of magnetization measurements on Bi-2201 showed that even though a linear temperature dependence of the upper critical field\nallows for the scaling of the magnetic moment with field\nand temperature, a power law (Tc \u2212 T )2.5 is needed to\nscale both the magnetic moment and its second derivative, \u2202 2 M/\u2202T 2 , thus implying a positive curvature in the\nHc2 line.12\nConsidering theories, some of them claim that the\ncurved line is a genuine transition intrinsically related to\nthe superconducting mechanism in cuprates. In Ref. 13,\nthe curved Hc2 (T ) obtained from out-of-plane resistivity is found consistent with the predictions based on\nthe Bose-Einstein condensation of bosons formed above\nTc . It was argued that this model is unable to account\nfor the observation of similar data for overdoped samples, whereas this could be explained within the BosonFermion model, which accounts for both real-space paired\ncarriers and itinerant Fermions.14 In Refs. 15,16, a peculiar magnetic pair-breaking mechanism specific to twodimensional superconductors, allowing both strong pairbreaking effects and a clean situation, was shown to cor-\n\n\f2\n\nII.\n\n3\n\nj\n\n2\n\ni\nh\n\n1\n0\n10\n\n2\n\n100\n\ni\nh\n\n-5\n\n\u03a9m)\n\nj\n\ng\n\n1\n\nf\ne\na\n\n0\n0\n\n100\n\nb c d\n\n200\n\n300\n\nT(K)\nFIG. 1: \u03c1(T ) in zero field for different doping. The sample was\nfully overdoped; then successive doping states were obtained\non the same sample by decreasing its oxygen content (see text\nfor details). These states were labeled chronologically, from a\nthe most overdoped, to j the most underdoped doping state.\nThe optimally doped state corresponds to label e. Inset, the\nthree most underdoped states are represented, in a semi-log\nrepresentation.\n\nSample and experimental setup\n\nTransport measurements were performed on one epitaxial, 2700 \u00c5 thick, c-axis oriented, Bi2 Sr2 CuO6+\u03b4 (Bi2201) thin film. Different levels of doping for this sample were studied, from superconducting overdoped to underdoped states (Fig. 1). The sample was grown on a\nheated SrTiO3 substrate, using rf sputtering (Ref. 21\nand refs. therein) and characterized by X-ray diffraction. The quality of the c-axis orientation is attested by\nthe rocking curve through the (008) peak, which has a full\nwidth at half maximum less than 0.2\u25e6 . It was patterned\nin the standard 4 point resistivity bridge, with a 160 \u03bcm\nlong and 95 \u03bcm large strip. The sample was first annealed at 420\u25e6 C and slowly cooled in a pure oxygen flow,\nyielding a non superconducting overdoped state. Successive lower-doped states were obtained by annealing the\nsample under vacuum, using temperatures between 240\nand 290\u25e6 C, thus decreasing its oxygen content. Figure 1\npresents the resistivity curves of these different doping\nstates, labeled from a (most overdoped) to j (most underdoped). Transition temperatures are defined at the\nmidpoint of the resistive transition. The transition width\n(10% \u2013 90% completion) of the optimally doped state\n(Tc \u2243 19 K) was 2 K. The evolution of doping was followed through the evolution of these transition temperatures. We observe that the transition temperature as a\nfunction of the conductivity at 300 K is well described by\na parabolic law (see Fig. 2). Although such a behavior\nis compatible with the empirical law relating the transition temperature to the doping level22 and a linear relationship between the conductivity and the doping level,\nthe conductivity should not be considered here as a direct measurement for the hole content as pointed out by\nRef. 23, but merely as a monotoneous function of it.\n\nH // c\n\n60\n50\n40\n30\n\nT(K)\n\nA.\n\nEXPERIMENTS\n\n3\n\n\u03c1 ( 10\n\nrectly describe the Hc2 (T ) features. Finally, it was proposed that the critical field obtained from resistivity is\nactually the one for phase ordering of superconducting\ngrains embedded in the material (with a critical temperature higher than the zero-field resistivity one);17,18 above\nthis field, decoupled grains with non-zero superconducting order parameter would subsist. This mechanism\ncould be either intrinsic to these cuprates for which there\nis a local doping effect,19,20 or could originate from chemical inhomogeneities or substitutions due to the elaboration process.\nIn this situation, experiments which are able to probe\nthe upper critical field above and below Tc are valuable.\nIn the following, we demonstrate that magnetoresistance\n\u2217\nmeasurements reveal a crossover field line Hc2\n(T ) above\nTc which is essentially similar to the Hc2 (T ) line below Tc .\nThis suggests that both lines are governed by a common\ncorrelation length, as expected for a regular continuous\ntransition.\n\n20\n\ng\n\n10\nj\n\n0\n\ni\n\nf\n\nd\n\ne\n\nc\n\nh\n\nb a\n\nH // ab\n\n60\n50\n40\n30\n20\n10\n0\n0\n\n1\n\n\u03c3 ( 300 K )\n\n( 10\n\n5\n\n2\n\n\u03a9\n\n\u22121\n\nm\n\n-1\n\n3\n\n)\n\nFIG. 2: Raw magnetoconductance data \u2206\u03c3(H = 6 T) for field\napplied perpendicular and parallel to the plane direction.

We postulate that the measured magnetoresistance originates from the sum of an isotropic\nmagnetoconductance (independent of the magnetic field\norientation), \u2206\u03c3iso , and an orbital one which scales with\nfield and angle according to the anisotropic-mass law,24,25\n\u2206\u03c3orb :\n\u2206\u03c3(\u03b8, H) = \u03c3(\u03b8, H) \u2212 \u03c3(\u03b8, 0) = \u2206\u03c3orb (H\u0303) + \u2206\u03c3iso (H),\n(1)\n2\n2\n2 1/2\n2\nwhere H\u0303 = H [cos(\u03b8) + \u03b3 sin(\u03b8) ]\nand \u03b3 < 1 is the\nanisotropic mass ratio. So we have :\n\u2206\u03c3orb (H) = \u2206\u03c3(0, H) \u2212 \u2206\u03c3(\u03c0/2, H) + \u2206\u03c3orb (\u03b3 H)(2)\n\u2206\u03c3iso (H) = \u2206\u03c3(\u03c0/2, H) \u2212 \u2206\u03c3(0, \u03b3 H) + \u2206\u03c3iso (\u03b3 H)\n(3)\nAs is usually done, we have neglected the last term\nin Eqs. (2, 3) to obtain \u2206\u03c3orb (Fig. 2, H// ab) and\n\u2206\u03c3iso (Fig. 2, H// c) from the longitudinal magnetoconductance, \u2206\u03c3(\u03c0/2, H), and the transverse one,\n\u2206\u03c3(0, H). We self-consistently checked that the former\nterms are negligible. Within the two-dimensional approximation (\u03b3 = 0), the longitudinal magnetoconductance data in Fig. 2 would directly yield the isotropic\nmagnetoconductance. As the present compound is not\nhighly anisotropic,26 the latter approximation is not\nstrictly valid and it is necessary to determine the sample anisotropy. The anisotropic mass ratio is obtained in\nthe following way: we first set \u2206\u03c3iso \u2261 0 and determine\nthe \u03b3 value which scales the angular data \u2206\u03c3(\u03b8, H) at\nH = 3 T and at H = 6 T, using Eq. (1). Then, using\nthe longitudinal and the transverse magnetoconductance\n\ndata and Eqs. (2, 3), the isotropic component is obtained\nas well as the orbital one. The scaling procedure is iterated taking into account the new orbital component until the \u03b3 value is consistent with the set of angular- and\nfield-dependent magnetoconductance data. As shown in\nFig. 3, \u03b3 \u22121 = 22 \u00b1 2 scales the data nicely. We have\nused this anisotropy value to extract the isotropic and orbital component of the magnetoconductance for all doping states.\n\nIII.\nA.\n\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION\n\nPositive isotropic magnetoconductance\n\nFor the two most underdoped states (i and j), a positive magnetoconductance for field applied along the\nCuO2 plane is found in a wide range of temperature\n(see the shaded area of Fig. 2). Using the procedure\ndescribed above, it is found that this results from the existence of a positive, isotropic magnetoconductance for\nthese doping states (Fig. 4). The origin of this positive\ncontribution can be found neither in the superconducting fluctuations (since the only positive contribution to\nthe field-dependent excess conductivity is the anomalous\nMaki-Thompson orbital one, which is anisotropic25 ), nor\nin the two-dimensional weak localization (the latter was\ngenerally thought to explain the low-temperature upturn\nof the resistivity in the underdoped cuprates until the\nobservation of a similar upturn in the transverse resistivity refuted this conventional picture27 ). The present\nresults contrast with the ones obtained on a heavily underdoped, nonsuperconducting, Bi2 Sr2 CuO6 single crystal in Ref. 28.

The magnetoconductance is expressed in units of\n\u03c30 = e2 /16~s, see equation 4. The inset shows the isotropic\nmagnetoconductance at 6 T vs T (filled and open symbols\nare for the most (j) and second most underdoped state (i) in\nFig. 2 respectively). Crosses are a fit of the isotropic magnetoconductance using the 'KMHZ' formula, with the Kondo\ntemperature TK = 15 K and the crossover field Hcr = 0.9 T.\n\npositive, anisotropic magnetoresistance, the authors interpreted the low-temperature resistivity upturn as the\noccurrence of weak two-dimensional localization. Our results for the most underdoped states clearly indicate that\nthe magnetoconductance is here a balance between a negative, anisotropic contribution (due to the superconducting fluctuations) and a positive, isotropic one, the former\novercoming the latter as T \u2192 Tc .\nIt is generally admitted that the isotropic magnetoconductance originates from a spin effect. While a positive contribution is in the case of out-of-plane conductivity naturally understood as the closing of the pseudogap\nby the magnetic field (at a characteristic field given by\ng\u03bcB H \u2248 kB T \u2217 , where T \u2217 is the temperature for the\nopening of the pseudogap29 ), the in-plane positive contribution cannot be accounted by the same effect, as the\nopening of the gap in the spin excitation spectrum results in an increase of the conductivity below T \u2217 and\na negative magnetoconductance.27 Such a behavior may\nbe expected from the Kondo mechanism. This was first\nproposed to account for the isotropic positive magnetoconductance in both insulating and superconducting\nLa2\u2212x Srx CuO4+y 30 (similar results were reported in the\ncase of Bi2 Sr2 Ca0.8 Y0.2 Cu2 O8+\u03b4 31 ). In the Kondo scenario, a crossover between a quadratic field dependence\nand a logarithmic one is expected when kB T \u2243 g\u03bcB Hcr ,\nwhere g = 2 (from the generalized Hamann formula32 \u2013\nor 'KMHZ' formula). However, in the references 30 and\n31 the crossover field was found one order of magnitude\nsmaller than this prediction. The same observation may\nbe done in the present case, as we have g\u03bcB Hcr /kB T \u2243\n0.1 (using Hcr \u2243 0.9 T at T = 18 K, Fig. 4). The same\ndiscrepancy is observed from the data in Ref. 33, where\n\nthe low-temperature resistivity upturn for heavily underdoped, non superconducting La2\u2212x Cex CuO4 was fitted\nusing the KMHZ formula : the KMHZ formula similarly\nfails to properly describe the negative magnetoresistance\nat the higher temperatures.\nAn alternative explanation may be looked for within\na spin-glass scenario, since, as pointed out in Ref. 30,\nspin glasses also exhibit an isotropic positive magnetoconductance. There are indeed evidences for the occurrence of a spin glass system on the high-doping side of\nthe antiferromagnetic phase, coexisting with the superconducting one (for a review, see Ref. 34). Metallic alloys\nexhibit a spin-glass state between the very dilute situation, showing the Kondo effect, and the concentrated one,\nfor which the ordered magnetic state (ferromagnetic or\nantiferromagnetic) is found. The glass state allows to account for a crossover field (actually, the exchange field)\nas small as the one observed here, as kB Tg \u2243 \u03bcB Hcr , using Tg \u2243 1 K, Tg being the freezing temperature. However, in this model, for temperatures higher than Tg , the\nmagnetoconductance should be quadratic up to a magnetic field much larger than Hcr :35,36 this is clearly not\nobserved here (Fig. 4).\nThus, for both the Kondo scenario and the spin-glass\none, we are faced with a contradiction concerning the energy scales inferred from the crossover field, and the much\nlarger thermal energy for the temperature at which it is\nmeasured. Such a contradiction can be resolved only in\nthe case of the existence of strong magnetic correlations.\nA remarkable feature is the occurrence of a maximum of\nthe positive magnetoconductance at T \u2243 20 K (Fig. 4,\ninset). A similar behavior is usually observed in ordered\nantiferromagnets close to TN . Thus, this non monotonic\nbehavior points towards the competition between a reduction of the spin scattering due to increased AF correlations and an increase due to local Kondo interactions\nas the temperature is lowered.\nFinally, it should be underlined that the negative magnetoresistance discussed above represents only a very\nsmall fraction of the low temperature resistivity upturn.\nThe fit in Fig. 4 indicates that the magnetic field is very\nfar from asymptotically exhausting this upturn, so the\nmechanisms discussed above do not allow us to conclude\non the origin of the resistivity upturn.\n\nB.\n1.\n\nOrbital magnetoconductance\n\nDominant Aslamazov-Larkin contribution\n\nTwo contributions to the orbital magnetoresistance\nare expected: the Aslamazov-Larkin one (ALO) and the\nMaki-Thompson one (MTO). Since the MTO contribution is less singular than the ALO one, it is expected\nto overcome the ALO contribution only well above Tc ,\nas verified experimentally.37,38 This situation should be\naccentuated here with respect to cuprates with a higher\nTc , due to the combined effects of stronger disorder and\n\n\f5\n5\n\n27 K\n\n29 K\n\n4\n-1\n\n31 K\n3\n\n3\n\n- \u2206 \u03c3 orb ( 10 \u03a9 m )\n\nlower temperature. In this regime, the characteristic field\nof the MTO contribution is H\u03c6 = ~/(4 D e\u03c4\u03c6 ), where D\nis the diffusion coefficient and \u03c4\u03c6 is the phase dephasing\ntime.39 We evaluate this field within a crude cylindrical\nFermi surface picture. Considering the optimally doped\nstate (e, Tc = 18.3 K) and T \u2243 2 Tc, using the carrier\nconcentration at optimal doping n \u2243 1.5 \u00d7 1027 m\u22123 and\nthe corresponding two-dimensional Fermi vector kF =\n3.4 \u00d7 109 m\u22121 (this obtained from both the straightforward chemical valency computation and the thermoelectric power in Ref. 40, and about twice smaller than\nwould be obtained from the maximum in the Hall resistance of this sample at about 100 K23 ) and the resistivity\n\u03c1 = 2.3 \u00d7 10\u22126 \u03a9m, we compute the metallic parameter\nkF l = 14. The two-dimensional free electron model, for\nwhich kF l = hs/\u03c1 e2 \u2013 where s = 12.3 \u00c5 is the conducting plane separation \u2013 yields the same value. Taking for\nthe hole effective mass m\u2217 = 3 me ,41 we get the diffusion\ncoefficient, D = ~ kF l/(2 m\u2217 ) = 3 \u00d7 10\u22124 m2 /s. Being in the linear resistivity regime, we may evaluate the\ndephasing rate as the thermal transport scattering rate,\n\u03c4 = 3 \u00d7 10\u221214 s. From this, we obtain the dephasing field\nH\u03c6 \u2243 20 T. This is only a crude approximation and the\nFermi surface complexity for cuprates must be taken into\naccount to account for their transport properties.42 Nevertheless, we consider that this is an indication that the\ncontribution from the MTO process should be small in\nthe range of field and temperature of interest. Furthermore, this correction, larger for larger temperature (the\nMTO contribution overcomes the ALO one as the temperature rises), should contribute to increase the magnetoresistance and cannot account for the curvature of the\n\u2217\nHc2\n(T ) line discussed below.\n\n2\n\n33 K\n\n1\n\n35 K\n\n0\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\nH\n\n2\n\n30\n\n40\n\n2\n\n(T )\n\nFIG. 5: Orbital magnetoconductance vs H 2 for the almost\noptimally doped state with Tc = 18.3 K (state e in Fig. 2)\nshowing quadratic field dependence at high temperature.\n\u2217\nTc of the upper critical field Hc2 (T ).

This excess\ncannot be due to the onset of localization, which would\nresult in a positive contribution.

Our data\nobtained above the zero field transition temperature confirm this curvature. It appears also that the transition\nis less robust to the magnetic field on the underdoped\nregime than it is on the overdoped one: the curvature for\n\u2217\nHc2\n(T ) appears to be stronger for the underdoped states\n(this is best evidenced in Fig. 7, by comparing the overdoped state b, with Tc = 11.6 K, to the corresponding\nunderdoped state g, with Tc = 12.1 K).\nIn a general manner, the observation of symmetric\nlines in the superconducting and the fluctuation regimes\npoints toward the existence of a conventional correlation\nlength similar to that obtained from the mean field theory of second-order phase transitions (defined as \u03be 2 =\n~/(2 e Hc2)), which is probed by the magnetic field.

Both procedures\nyield a similar curved crossover field. The inset shows that\nthe crossover field obtained from fluctuations roughly scales\nas Tc .\n\nnote that Nernst-effect measurements may also be used\nto define symmetric crossover lines. Such measurements\nlocate the Hc2 (T ) line obtained from resistivity measurements as a crossover between the melting line and the\nridge line joining points of maxima of the Nernst signal\nvs H.7 A ridge line may also be found in the fluctuation regime above Tc from the data in Fig. 13 of Ref. 7:\nthis line \u2013 connecting the points where the contour line\nof the Nernst signal shows a vertical tangent \u2013 is found\nroughly symmetric with respect to Tc and may indicate\nthe existence of a similar crossover line in the fluctuation\nregime.\nWe believe our observation first rules out a conventional flux-flow mechanism in a vortex line liquid as the\norigin of the anomalous Hc2 (T ) curvature. Indeed, this\nshould occur in the vicinity of the vortex melting line\ntransition (in the (H, T ) plane), which is first order and\nthus does not have a dual line in the fluctuation regime.\nHowever, above this line, it was proposed from numerical\nsimulations that there exists a second line which may be\nviewed as an extension of the zero field vortex loop unbinding transition to finite magnetic field.2 Such a vortex unbinding is invoked to account for the anomalous\nNernst signal. According to Ref. 2, this line may represent a true thermodynamic transition, while the mean\nfield Hc2 (T ) line would be reduced to a crossover line.\nNow, does this transition define a correlation length that\ncould also be probed by the magnetic field in the regime\nof fluctuating Cooper pairs? By analogy with the lowtemperature mechanism, this requires that fluctuating\nvortex loops can thread the superconducting fluctuating\n\n\f7\n\u2206\u03c3orb ( 6 T ) / \u03c30 = - 5 x 10\n\n-2\n\nT (K)\n\n30\n\nTC\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n0\n\n1\n\n\u03c3 ( 300 K )\n\n( 10\n\n5\n\n2\n\n\u03a9\n\n\u22121\n\nm\b )\n\n3\n\nFIG. 8: Iso orbital magnetoconductance (open circles) and\nTc (full circles) in a temperature-\u03c3(300 K) phase diagram for\nthe different doping (see Fig. 2 for comparison). The full and\ndotted lines are homothetic parabolas. The open circles represent the temperature where the orbital magnetoconductance\nat our maximal field reaches a given value, expressed as a ratio of \u03c30 (see Eq. 4). Changing this ratio (\u22125 \u00d7 10\u22122 here)\ndoes not alter the shape of the dome. An excess of negative\norbital magnetoconductance can be seen on the underdoped\nside.\n\ndomains which has, to our knowledge, never been considered.\nDescription of high-Tc superconductivity by means of\ngranular models is appealing, as there is some evidence\nthat the granular nature of the Bi-based compounds is\nstronger in the underdoped regime,19,20 which would be\n\u2217\nin agreement with the marked curvature of the Hc2\n(T )\nline in this regime. Also, such a granularity may account for the observation of an anomalous effect of the\ntransport current on the superconducting fluctuations\nin Bi-2201.47 Concerning the superconducting cluster\nmodel,17,18 the proposed mechanism \u2013 the magnetic-field\ninduced decoupling of large superconducting islands, connected through a normal-metal proximity effect \u2013 implies\nthat the resistive transition line is governed by the temperature for coherence of the normal-metal areas, which\nis much smaller than the phase-ordering temperature.\nSo, this model cannot account for the existence of a sym\u2217\nmetric line Hc2\n(T ) in the fluctuating regime. A similar objection may be made against the phase fluctuation\nmodel in Ref. 48: when the mean-field temperature at\nwhich pairing sets in is well above the transition temperature for phase coherence, the analogy of this model\nwith one of a Josephson-junctions array allows to conclude that no symmetric transition line is expected with\nrespect to the phase-coherence transition temperature.\nThe model in Ref. 15 for inhomogeneities of the order of\nthe coherence length does not have such an inconvenient,\n\nbut corrections to the conventional upper critical field are\nsmall and leave this quantity unchanged near Tc . So it is\n\u2217\ndifficult to account for the reduced slope of the Hc2\n(T )\nline close to Tc .\nConcerning the magnetic impurities mechanisms,15,16\nthe pair-breaking effect must be specific to the underdoped regime. As it is essential also in this model, the\nspin-flip scattering time should increase as the temperature decreases: our observation of a positive isotropic\nmagnetoconductance in the strongly underdoped regime\nand a possible magnetic ordering at low temperature goes\nalong these lines. However, the fact that this mechanism\nrests on some low magnetic-ordering temperature breaks\nthe symmetry with respect to Tc , and the Hc2 (T ) curvature should actually be reversed in the fluctuation regime.\nFinally, the increased curvature in the underdoped\nregime appears to be consistent with both the BoseEinstein condensation and the Boson fermion models. As\ncan be seen from the above considerations, it is essential\nthat, in these models, the upper critical field is determined only by the bulk transition temperature and that\nno other temperature scale (such as magnetic ordering\nin Ref. 15, or coherence of a metallic grain in Ref. 18) is\nfound. In the case of the models with preformed Bosons,\nthere is an energy scale corresponding to their formation; but this energy scale does not appear in the determination of the upper critical field, making these models\ncompatible with the present observation.\n\nIV.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nWe have investigated the magnetoresistance for a\nBi2 Sr2 CuO6+\u03b4 thin film, from highly overdoped to highly\nunderdoped states above the zero-field resistive superconducting transition temperature. The isotropic magnetoresistance is found negative for the lower (but still\nsuperconducting) doping states, which we tentatively interpret as a contribution from strongly correlated magnetic scatters. The orbital positive magnetoresistance is\nfitted by the Aslamazov-Larkin theory. This yields an\nanomalous critical-field temperature dependence, which\nagrees with previous resistive measurements below Tc .\nThis points toward the existence of a similar correlation\nlength above and below Tc , as expected for a continuous\ntransition and rules out models where the resistive transition is determined by the onset of phase coherence, as\nis the case for the flux lattice melting mechanism or the\nphase decoupling one.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nWe acknowledge the support of CMCU to Project No.\n04/G1307.\n\n\f8\n\n\u2217\n\n1\n2\n\n3\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\nAlso at L.P.M.C., D\u00e9partement de Physique, Facult\u00e9\ndes Sciences de Tunis, campus universitaire 1060 Tunis,\nTunisia.\nA.
