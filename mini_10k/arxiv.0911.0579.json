The angular momentum operators for a system of two spin-zero indistinguishable particles are constructed, using Isham's Canonical Group Quantization method.\nThis mathematically rigorous method provides a hint at the correct definition of (total) angular momentum operators, for arbitrary spin, in a system of indistinguishable particles.\nThe connection with other configuration space approaches to spin-statistics is discussed,\nas well as the relevance of the obtained results in view of a possible alternative proof of the\nspin-statistics theorem.\n\n1. I NTRODUCTION\nThe interest in a better understanding of the spin-statistics connection has increased in\nthe last years. In particular, many ideas having as final aim a derivation of the connection\nwithin non-relativistic quantum mechanics have been discussed [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]. In\nthis context, the properties of the configuration space QN of N identical (indistinguishable)\nparticles have been particularly emphasized, in view of possible physical implications.\nThe main fact motivating this approach is well known: In three spatial dimensions, the\nFermi-Bose alternative emerges naturally (for spin zero particles) from the topology of the\nconfiguration space. In two spatial dimensions, the possibility of anyonic statistics also\nfollows from the topological properties of the corresponding configuration space. Thus,\nby including the indistinguishability of quantum particles at the configuration space level,\nthe need for a further \"symmetrization postulate\" disappears. The history of the developments associated to this circle of ideas is quite complex and involves the contributions\nof many authors. This includes the implementation of Feynman's path integral approach\non multiply-connected spaces as initiated by Schulmann [9], its application to systems\nof identical particles by Laidlaw and DeWitt [10] and the more geometric formulation of\nLeinaas and Myrheim [11]. For a more detailed description of these (and more recent) developments, the reader is referred to [12, 13, 14] and to the references cited therein. In this\npaper, our main purpose is to draw attention to a point that, in our opinion, appears not to\nhave been taken sufficiently into account, namely, the relevance of the algebra of operators\n2000 Mathematics Subject Classification. 81S05, 81Q70.\nKey words and phrases.

REYES-LEGA AND CARLOS BENAVIDES\n\nfor any quantum description of a system of identical particles based on the configuration\nspace QN . The subtleties involved in the correct definition of infinitesimal (i.e. self-adjoint)\ngenerators of symmetries, their domains and the algebras they represent are well known in\nthe context of quantization theory. But, in our view, in the context of the non-relativistic\napproach to spin-statistics they have received very little attention. We believe that a careful\nanalysis of the representation-theoretic and functional-analytic issues involved in such an\napproach could, eventually, shed new light into the problem.\nHaving this aim in mind, in the present paper we will, as a first step in that direction,\nconsider the construction of the infinitesimal generators of rotations for a system of two indistinguishable spin zero particles. The construction is based on Isham's canonical group\nquantization [16]. The results obtained will allow us to establish contact with other approaches and hence to discuss their physical meaning. Additionally, in this paper we will\nshow that, contrary to the opinion of some authors (see, for example, [17, 18, 19]), constructions like the one developed by Berry and Robbins [2], although different in some\ncrucial respects to the usual form of quantum mechanics, do perfectly fit into a general\nscheme of quantum mechanics, based on the generally accepted postulates.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In section 2, some well known facts about canonical commutation relations are reviewed. With this motivation, we briefly review Isham's\nCanonical Group Quantization method in section 3, emphasizing (i) the construction of\nunitary representations of the canonical group for homogeneous spaces and (ii) the role\nplayed by the fundamental group of the configuration space and its associated universal\ncover fibration. In section 4 we then proceed, using Isham's method, to exhibit the canonical group for a system of two indistinguishable particles in 3 spatial dimensions. The\nunitary representations of the canonical group are used to explicitly construct the infinitesimal generators of rotations for this system. Section 5 contains the main results of the\npaper. There we establish explicit connections with previous treatments of quantum indistinguishability. In particular, the connections to the projective module approach developed\nin [5, 12, 14, 15], as well as to the Berry-Robbins approach, are discussed. Based on our\nresults, a general definition of \"spin observables\" in the context of quantum indistinguishability will be proposed. We finish with some conclusions in section 6.\nLet us remark that a detailed construction of angular momentum operators for a magnetic monopole and for a system of indistinguishable particles (as in the present paper) will\nappear in the Villa de Leyva proceedings volume [13]. The explicit calculations performed\nin [13] using the Hopf bundle provide an additional motivation for the concrete realization\nof the projective plane as a homogeneous space that we have chosen here.\n2. R EMARKS\n\nON\n\nC ANONICAL C OMMUTATION R ELATIONS\n\nFor simplicity, we will start by considering quantum mechanics in one spatial dimension. We want to recall some crucial facts that link the geometry of the classical phase\nspace to the form of the canonical commutation relations (CCR). In one spatial dimension,\nthe CCR are given by\n[q\u0302, p\u0302] = ih\u0304, [q\u0302, q\u0302] = 0 = [ p\u0302, p\u0302] .\n(1)\nAccording to the correspondence principle, quantum observables (as self-adjoint operators\nacting on a Hilbert space) are obtained by means of a map \" \u02c6 \" for which the position\nvariable q is promoted to a multiplication operator q\u0302 and for which the momentum p, the\ncanonical conjugate of q, is promoted to a differentiation operator p\u0302 = \u2212ih\u0304d/dx. More\ngenerally, Dirac's quantization conditions require the replacement of classical observables\nf (that is, functions on phase space) by self-adjoint operators f\u02c6 acting on a Hilbert space\n\n\fREMARKS ON THE CONFIGURATION SPACE APPROACH TO SPIN-STATISTICS\n\n3\n\nH , in such a way that the Poisson Bracket of two classical observables is mapped to the\ncommutator of the corresponding self-adjoint operators. Furthermore, one would like to\nhave the property\n\u03c6d\n( f ) = \u03c6 ( f\u02c6),\n(2)\nfor sufficiently well behaved real functions \u03c6 , say, for polynomials (von Neumann's rule).\nAs is well known, such a quantization program is not implementable (Groenewold-Van\nHove's theorem). The proof of that theorem requires some additional technical assumptions, which we prefer to leave aside at this moment. For our purposes, a simple example\nwill make the point clear.\nSuppose that a quantization map \" \u02c6 \" having the above mentioned properties exists.\nThen we can compare the result of quantizing the function f (q, p) = (pq)2 in two different\nways, as explained below. Assume that the von Neumann rule (2) holds for \u03c6 (t) = t 2 , and\nconsider the identities\n\u0001\n1\n(p + q)2 \u2212 p2 \u2212 q2\n(3)\npq =\n2\nand\n\u0001\n1\np2 q2 =\n(4)\n(p2 + q2)2 \u2212 p4 \u2212 q4 .\n2\nd = 1/2( p\u0302q\u0302 + q\u0302 p\u0302). Squaring this\nApplying the von Neumann rule to (3) we obtain (pq)\nexpression and applying the CCR and the von Neumann rule repeatedly, we then obtain:\n1\n(5)\n(c\npq)2 = p\u03022 q\u03022 + 2ih\u0304 p\u0302q\u0302 \u2212 h\u03042 .\n4\nIn contrast, an analogous procedure, starting from (4), leads to\n\\\n2 q2 ) = p\u03022 q\u03022 + 2ih\u0304 p\u0302q\u0302 \u2212 h\u03042 ,\n(p\n\n(6)\n\nshowing clearly that there is a consistency problem. Mechanisms have nevertheless been\ndevised in order to circumvent this and similar difficulties. These have been available for\na long time and are well known, specially in the mathematical physics community. One of\nthese, geometric quantization [20, 21], is closely related to symplectic geometry. It allows\none (in certain cases), starting from a symplectic manifold M, to map homomorphically\nsome subalgebra of the Poisson algebra (C\u221e (M), { , }) to an algebra of operators acting on\na suitably defined Hilbert space. But there are topological obstructions to the existence of\nsuch a map and the crucial steps of polarization and half-form corrections often obscure\nthe physical aspects of the problem.\nNow, one could argue that quantization methods have little to do with the problem of\nquantum indistinguishability, given that we are not only interested in the spin zero case,\nand that, as is often said, \"there is no classical model for spin\". Although it is possible\nto envisage classical models (i.e. symplectic manifolds) for which spin arises as a consequence of a quantization procedure, this is not our main point of concern, regarding the\nrelevance of quantization. Our point is rather that, just because of the fact that we are\ndealing with a classical configuration space, the very definition of the self-adjoint operators related to the symmetries of the configuration space depend crucially on the geometry\nof the configuration space. And this is precisely where the experience gained from the\ndevelopment of the different quantization methods might prove useful.\nQuite recently, in a series of interesting papers, H.A. Kastrup [22, 23, 24] has been\ninsisting on this point. He has pointed out that the careful consideration of these matters for\nthe formulation of quantum mechanics on spaces like e.g., a circle, might have important\nconsequences for diverse problems in quantum optics, in treatments of the Casimir effect,\n\n\f4\n\nANDR\u00c9S F. REYES-LEGA AND CARLOS BENAVIDES\n\nin relation to the cosmological constant, etc.. The approach followed by Kastrup is to\na great extent based on the quantization method explained in the inspiring Les Houches\nlecture notes by Isham [16]. This method, in turn, has many features in common with\ngeometric quantization and also uses techniques developed by Mackey [25] and Kirillov\n[26].\nReturning to CCR, let us consider the following interesting example. Instead of R,\nwe take as configuration space a half-line, the set R+ of positive real numbers. Let us\nassume that we can take, as Hilbert space, the space H = (R+ , dx). Now, let us assume\nfor a moment that the momentum operator p\u0302 = \u2212ih\u0304d/dx is a well defined, self-adjoint\noperator. Then, since p\u0302 is the infinitesimal generator of translations, we can construct the\nunitary operator U(a) = e\u2212ia p\u0302 . This operator would have the effect, on wave functions, of\ntranslating them by a distance h\u0304a:\n(U(a)\u03c8 )(x) = \u03c8 (x \u2212 h\u0304a).\n\n(7)\n\nBut were this true, we could always choose a in such a way that the support of U(a)\u03c8\nends up lying outside R+ . Thus, the CCR in the form (1) cannot hold in this space. The\nreason for the breakdown of the CCR is that the vector field \u2202 /\u2202 x on this space is not\ncomplete. Thus, the momentum operator p\u0302 is not well defined. Another example, that has\nbeen much more discussed in the literature, is the circle. If we take as configuration space\nthe circle S1 , the CCR breaks down again. The reason, in this case, lies in the fact that S1\ndoes not admit a global system of coordinates: At least two coordinate charts are needed.\nThis fact has been known for a long time, the example being closely related, for instance,\nto the Aharonov-Bohm effect. In this case, it is the topology of the configuration space\nthat determines the correct substitute for the CCR. Additionally, in this case there are many\ndifferent (i.e. unitarily inequivalent) Hilbert space representations of the new commutation\nrelations, in contrast to the case of Rn , where the Stone-von Neumann theorem guarantees\nthe uniqueness, up to unitary equivalence, of the standard form of the CCR (1). Quite\nsurprisingly, it is only until recently that these ideas have started to really draw attention\nregarding concrete applications as, for instance, in problems related to coherent states.\nThe particular emphasis of Isham's method on -first of all- finding the appropriate commutation relations, given a classical configuration space, is very useful when studying this\ntype of problems. It turns out that even the CCR for quantum mechanics on R have a deep\ngeometric origin. To explain this, let us consider, following Isham, the unitary operators\nU(a) := e\u2212ia p\u0302 , V (b) := e\u2212ibq\u0302 .\n\n(8)\n\nThen, it is easy to check that the following transformation rules for the position and momentum operators hold:\nU(a)q\u0302U(a)\u22121\n\n=\n\nq\u0302 \u2212 h\u0304a,\n\n\u22121\n\n=\n\np\u0302 + h\u0304b.\n\nV (b) p\u0302V (b)\n\n(9)\n\nTaking into account the correspondence principle, it is then natural to consider the following action of the additive group R \u00d7 R on the phase space T \u2217 R:\n(R \u00d7 R) \u00d7 T \u2217 R\n\n\u2212\u2192\n\nT \u2217R\n\n( (a, b), (q, p) )\n\n7\u2212\u2192 (q \u2212 a, p + b).\n\n(10)\n\nA natural question then arises:\nWhat is the relation between the (additive) group G = (R \u00d7 R, + ) and the CCR in the\nform [q\u0302, p\u0302] = ih\u0304 which, in the end, were the relations leading us to (10)?\n\n\fREMARKS ON THE CONFIGURATION SPACE APPROACH TO SPIN-STATISTICS\n\n5\n\nAs explained at length in [16], the answer is given by a general formulation of the\nquantization problem for a classical configuration space. According to Isham's method,\nthe fundamental structure behind the CCR is a so-called canonical group C . This group\nmay arise directly from the geometry of the configuration space, or more indirectly, arising\nas the solution to an obstruction problem, related to the construction of a quantization map.\nIn both cases, there is a group G of transformations of the phase space, from where all other\nstructures are derived1. In the example of R, the group G is G := (R \u00d7 R, + ), acting on\nphase space as indicated above, and the group C is the Heisenberg group. In the general\ncase of Rn , the latter is the group with underlying set Rn \u00d7 Rn \u00d7 R and product defined by\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1~\n~\n~\n~\n~\n~\n(~a1 , b1 , r1 ) * (~a2 , b2 , r2 ) := ~a1 +~a2, b1 + b2 , r1 + r2 + (b1 *~a2 \u2212 b2 *~a1 ) .\n(11)\n2\nThe unitary representations of this group (returning to the case of R) are given by operators\nof the form\n(12)\nU (a, b, r) = U(a)V (b)ei\u03bc (r+ab/2),\nwith U(a) and V (b) operators satisfying the (Weyl) relations\nV (b1 )V (b2 )\n\n= V (b1 + b2 ),\n\nU(a1 )U(a2 )\n\n= U(a1 + a2),\n\nU(a)V (b) = V (b)U(a)e\n\n\u2212i \u03bc ab\n\n(13)\n.\n\nAs is well known, these are precisely the commutation relations satisfied by the operators\ndefined in (8). The unitary representation U allows us to obtain a representation \u03c1 of the\nLie algebra of the canonical group C . In this case, the Lie algebra of C is the Heisenberg\nalgebra, which is given, for general n, by (Rn \u2295 Rn \u2295 R, [ , ]), with Lie bracket\n\u0010\n\u0011\n[(~a1 ,~b1 , c1 ), (~a2 ,~b2 , c2 )] := ~0,~0,~b1 *~a2 \u2212~b2 *~a1 .\n(14)\n\nAs can be easily checked, the representation \u03c1 of this algebra obtained from U , gives\nprecisely the CCR (1), with p\u0302 = i\u03c1 (1, 0, 0), q\u0302 = i\u03c1 (0, 1, 0) and i\u03c1 (0, 0, 1) = \u03bc \u2261 h\u0304. The\nanswer to the question posed above is, then: The Lie algebra of the canonical group C is\na central extension, by R, of the Lie algebra of G = (R \u00d7 R, + ). Therefore, in this context, Planck's constant is seen to arise as the \"central charge\" of the extension. The deep\ngeometrical meaning of these structures becomes clear after examining different examples\nof configuration spaces, like the ones discussed above, and for which no a priori given\nposition or momentum operators are given. Hence, in those cases, Isham's approach turns\nout to provide a mathematically rigorous and physically profound method to find the appropriate commutation relations. For instance, when the configuration space is the circle\nS1 , so that the phase space is T \u2217 S1 \u223c\n= S1 \u00d7 R, the canonical group will have a subgroup\ngiven by the group of rotations SO(2), acting through diffeomorphisms and, in addition,\nan additive subgroup (R2 , +) related to the functions cos \u03c6 and sin \u03c6 . The combined action\nof these groups on the phase space T \u2217 S1 gives rise to a semi-direct product R2 \u22ca SO(2) or,\nf\nmore generally, to the group R2 \u22ca SO(2).\nThe topological quantum effects related to this\nsystem (i.e. \"\u03b8 -states\") can be directly related to the unitary, irreducible representations of\nf\nthe canonical group R2 \u22ca SO(2).\nSimilarly, Dirac's quantization condition for the charge\nof a magnetic monopole can be directly linked to the unitary, irreducible representations of\nthe group R3 \u22ca SU(2), the canonical group of the phase space T \u2217 S2 . In all these examples,\n1The groups G and C are closely related and do coincide in many cases.\n\n\f6\n\nANDR\u00c9S F. REYES-LEGA AND CARLOS BENAVIDES\n\nthe self-adjoint generators of the representations will furnish an algebra whose commutation relations can be regarded as the \"canonical\" commutation relations appropriate for the\ngiven system.\nIn the next section, we will briefly describe Isham's method, and in section 4 we will\nuse this method in order to construct the infinitesimal generators of rotations for a system\nof two identical particles.\n3. C ANONICAL G ROUP Q UANTIZATION\nIn this section we briefly summarize the method of Canonical Group Quantization, as\ndeveloped by Isham in [16]. The interested reader is encouraged to consult this reference,\nwhere many examples are worked out explicitly and lots of background motivation is given.\n3.1. The canonical group. Roughly speaking, the general idea of this method suggests\nthat the quantization of a symplectic manifold M is made possible, first, by finding a Lie\nalgebra which is related (in a way to be explained) to a group G of symplectic transformations of M and, second, by the assumption that this Lie algebra generates, in some sense,\nthe set of classical observables. In other words, the idea of the quantization scheme is to\nmap isomorphically the Lie algebra L (G ) onto some Lie subalgebra of (C\u221e (M, R), { , }).\nThis map, called P, allows one to define a quantization map by fixing a representation U of\nthe group and assigning to each function lying in the image of P the self-adjoint generator\nobtained from U by means of P\u22121 .\nThe program can be summarized by the following diagram:\n0\n\n/R\n\nj\n/ C\u221e (M, R)\n/ HamVF(M)\nfN N\nO\nNN\n\u03b3\nP N N\nL (G )\n\n/ 0.\n\n(15)\n\nThe meaning of the different terms appearing in (15) is the following. M is a symplectic\nmanifold (phase space). In many cases, and particularly in the example we consider in\nthis paper, this phase space is a cotangent bundle, M = T \u2217 Q, with Q a configuration space.\nThe map j assigns to each function f on phase space (the negative of) its Hamiltonian\nvector field. Following the notation in [16], we shall write this action in the following way:\nj( f ) = \u2212\u03be f . G is a Lie group, acting by symplectic transformations on M. L (G ) denotes\nthe Lie algebra of G . The map \u03b3 : L (G ) \u2192 HamVF(M) is the Lie algebra homomorphism\ninduced by the G -action. The first row of the diagram represents a short exact sequence,\nbecause the kernel of the map j is the set of constant functions on phase space. The motivation for studying that diagram comes from the fact that Hamiltonian vector fields generate\nlocal one-parameter groups of symplectic transformations. Hence, if we are given a Lie\nsub-algebra of C\u221e (M, R), the corresponding Hamiltonian vector fields can, in principle,\nproduce a group of symplectic transformations (for this to be possible, the vector fields\nmust be complete). In this way, a relation between functions in the given Lie sub-algebra\nand elements in the Lie algebra of the group of symplectic transformations can be obtained.\nThe idea expressed in (15) is based on the possibility of reversing the procedure, i.e., if we\nstart with a group G of symplectic transformations, it is possible to associate a locally\nHamiltonian vector field to each element in the Lie algebra of the group. This mapping\nis denoted \u03b3 in (15). Now, if the vector fields are Hamiltonian, then one can try to find a\nkind of \"inverse\" for j, i.e., to find a Lie algebra homomorphism P : L (G ) \u2192 C\u221e (M, R)\n\n\fREMARKS ON THE CONFIGURATION SPACE APPROACH TO SPIN-STATISTICS\n\n7\n\nin such a way that\nj\u25e6P = \u03b3\n\n(16)\n\nholds.\nSummarizing, the first step of Isham's scheme consists in finding a Lie group G acting on M by symplectic transformations and then trying to associate its Lie algebra with\nfunctions on M. More precisely, one looks for a Lie algebra homomorphism\nP : L (G ) \u2212\u2192 C\u221e (M, R)\nA 7\u2212\u2192 P(A)\n\n(17)\n\nsatisfying (16). In order for the G -action on M to be suitable for the quantization procedure\nto work, the following requirements must be met (cf. [16]):\n\u2022 The vector fields induced through \u03b3 by the G -action must be globally Hamiltonian. This is required if the relation (16) is to make sense and will be the case if\nH 1 (M, R) = 0, or if G is semi-simple.\n\u2022 The action must be almost effective (this implies that \u03b3 will be injective) and transitive.\nIf this task is accomplished, we will be able to define a quantization map by using a unitary\nrepresentation U of the group and assigning to each smooth function, in the image of\nP, the self-adjoint generator obtained from U. To achieve the correspondence between\nclassical observables and the Lie algebra L (G ), P must be linear and also a Lie algebra\nhomomorphism. In other words, P must satisfy, in addition to (16),\n{P(A), P(B)} = P([A, B]),\n\n(18)\n\nfor all A and B in L (G ). In general, the existence of a map P with the desired properties is\nnot something obvious (cf. [16]). There might be algebraic obstructions to the existence of\nP, arising from the quite stringent requirement (18). In those cases where the obstruction\ncannot be removed by a redefinition of the map P, a central extension of L (G ) by R can\nbe used to construct the quantization map. In the example Q = R, discussed in the previous\nsection, the obstruction cannot be removed and this is the reason that forces one to consider\nthe central extension of the Lie algebra of G = (R \u00d7 R, +). The canonical group C will be\neither G (in case the obstruction can be made to vanish) or otherwise it will be the unique\nsimply connected group the Lie algebra of which is the central extension of L (G ). The\nnext step of the quantization method (briefly discussed in the next subsection) consists in\nfinding all irreducible, unitary representations of the canonical group.\nAn important question regarding the canonical group is whether, given a symplectic\nmanifold M, we can find a Lie group with the required properties and if so, how can\nwe choose among the possible, candidate groups. It turns out that when the symplectic\nmanifold is a cotangent bundle, M = T \u2217 Q, there is a kind of \"universal\" solution to the\nproblem of finding a canonical group. Indeed, the semi-direct product C\u221e (Q, R)/R\u22caDiffQ\nacts on T \u2217 Q by symplectic transformations. The action \u03c1 is defined, for [h] \u2208 C\u221e (Q, R)/R,\n\u03c6 \u2208 DiffQ and l \u2208 Tq\u2217 Q, by:\n\n\u03c1([h],\u03c6 ) (l) := \u03c6 \u22121\u2217 (l) \u2212 (dh)\u03c6 (q) .\n\n(19)\n\nWhereas the groups C\u221e (Q, R)/R and DiffQ act separately on T \u2217 Q by symplectic transformations in a natural (but not transitive) way, the combined action (19) is a group action\nif an only if the set C\u221e (Q, R)/R \u00d7 DiffQ is endowed with the structure of a semi-direct\n\n\f8\n\nANDR\u00c9S F. REYES-LEGA AND CARLOS BENAVIDES\n\nproduct. This follows from the requirement \u03c1g1 \u25e6 \u03c1g2 = \u03c1g1 g2 . Indeed, we have:\n\n\u03c1([h2 ],\u03c62 ) \u25e6 \u03c1([h1 ],\u03c61 ) (l) = \u03c1([h2 ],\u03c62 ) (\u03c61\u22121\u2217 (l) \u2212 (dh1 )\u03c61 (q) )\n= \u03c62\u22121\u2217 (\u03c61\u22121\u2217 (l) \u2212 (dh1 )\u03c61 (q) ) \u2212 (dh2)\u03c62 \u25e6\u03c61 (q)\n= ((\u03c62 \u25e6 \u03c61 ) )\n\n\u22121 \u2217\n\n= \u03c1([h\n\n(20)\n\n(l) \u2212 d(\u03c62\u22121\u2217 h1 + h2 )\u03c62 \u25e6\u03c61 (q)\n\n\u22121\n1 \u25e6\u03c62 +h2 ],\u03c62 \u25e6\u03c61 )\n\n(l),\n\nso that \u03c1 is a group action if and only if the product in C\u221e (Q, R)/R \u00d7 DiffQ is given by\n([h2 ], \u03c62 ) * ([h1 ], \u03c61 ) = ([h2 ] + [h1\u25e6\u03c62\u22121 ], \u03c62 \u25e6\u03c61 ).\n\n(21)\n\nThe crucial point is that such a group action turns out to be transitive and effective so that, in\nthis case, the problem of finding a canonical group reduces to that of finding suitable finite\ndimensional subgroups W 6 C\u221e (Q, R) and G 6 DiffQ, such that the symplectic action of\nW \u22ca G on T \u2217 Q is still transitive.\n3.2. Representations of the canonical group for homogeneous spaces. The next step\nof Isham's scheme is to study the representations of the canonical group. In general, this\nis not an obvious step, since the canonical group has non-trivial properties. However, we\ndo not need to consider the general case but only the class of groups that typically arise in\nphysical systems. Actually, in this work we only need to consider homogeneous spaces of\nthe form Q = G/H where G and H are Lie groups. In this case, the procedure to follow is\nthe following:\n1. Find a vector space W , and a linear action R of G on W , such that G/H is a G-orbit\non W .\n2. T \u2217 Q is then obtained by restriction of T \u2217W \u223c\n= W \u00d7 W \u2217.\n\u2217\n\u2217\n3. There is a left action of G := W \u22ca G on T W , given by\n\u0001\nl(\u03c6 \u2032 ,g) (u, \u03c6 ) := R(g)u, R\u2217 (g\u22121 )\u03c6 \u2212 \u03c6 \u2032 ,\n\nwhere R\u2217 is the linear action of G on W \u2217 induced by duality. If we restrict the\ndomain of every \u03c6 \u2208 W \u2217 to the G-orbit, we can regard \u03c6 as a smooth function\nf \u03c6 : Q \u2192 R, given by f \u03c6 (u) := \u03c6 (u), (u \u2208 Q \u0592\u2192 W ). Therefore, we can regard\nG as a finite dimensional subgroup of C\u221e (Q, R)/R \u00d7 DiffQ and consider it as a\nlegitimate candidate for the canonical group.\n4. The map P from (15) is given, in this case, by\nP : L (W \u2217 \u22ca G) \u2212\u2192 C\u221e (Q\u2217W, R)\n\u00c3 = (\u03c6 , A)\n\n7\u2212\u2192 P(\u00c3) : (u, \u03c8 ) 7\u2192 \u03c8 (R(A)u) + \u03c6 (u).\n\n(22)\n\n5. It can be shown (cf. [16]), that G satisfies all the properties required by the scheme:\nThe action is symplectic (by construction) and it is also effective and transitive.\nMoreover, the map P is a Lie algebra homomorphism. Hence, there is no obstruction and the canonical group can be chosen to be G .\nThe unitary, irreducible representations of G can be constructed using Mackey's theory of\ninduced representations. The representation space will be the space of square-integrable\nsections of a hermitian vector bundle E over Q = G/H, associated to the principal bundle\nG \u2192 G/H. This requires the use of an irreducible unitary representation of H and the\nexistence of a G-quasi-invariant measure \u03bc on Q. The operators representing G are then\nconstructed using a lift l \u2191 of the G-action l on Q to the corresponding associated vector\nbundle E. This lift will provide E with the structure of a G-vector bundle, i.e., the lift l \u2191\n\n\fREMARKS ON THE CONFIGURATION SPACE APPROACH TO SPIN-STATISTICS\n\n9\n\ngives a G-action on E which is linear on the fibers and such that the following diagram\ncommutes (g \u2208 G):\n\u2191\n\nlg\n\nE\n\u03c0\n\n\u000f\nQ\n\n/E\n\n(23)\n\n\u03c0\nlg\n\n\u000f\n/Q\n\nIn the present case, the lift is the one naturally induced by the right action of G on the\nprincipal bundle (cf. [16]). Explicitly, we have, for an equivalence class [(p, v)] \u2208 E (recall\nthat E is associated to G \u2192 G/H through an irreducible representation of H):\nlg\u2191 ([(p, v)]) := [(gp, v)].\n\n(24)\n\nOnce we have identified the lift, we can define the unitary operator U (\u03c6 , g) (this operator is\nto be compared to the one defined in (12) ) through its action on square-integrable sections\n\u03a8 \u2208 \u0393(E):\ns\nd \u03bcg\n(x) lg\u2191 \u03a8(g\u22121 * x),\n(25)\n(U (\u03c6 , g)\u03a8)(x) := e\u2212i\u03c6 (x)\nd\u03bc\nwhere d \u03bcg /d \u03bc is the Radon-Nikodym derivative of \u03bcg with respect to \u03bc .\nIn the present paper we are only interested in the subgroup G of the canonical group, as\nit this this group that will give rise to the topological quantum effects we are seeking. Let\nus therefore define the unitary operator\nU(g) := U (0, g).\n\n(26)\n\nNow, if we consider a curve gt on G, corresponding to a given infinitesimal generator J\nof the group, we can obtain the action of the infinitesimal generators on sections through\ndifferentiation with respect to t:\nJ \u03a8(x) :=\n\nd\ndt\n\n(U(g)\u03a8)(x).\n\n(27)\n\nt=0\n\nThis is the key formula for the calculations in the following sections.\nRemark 1. Here we have considered the quantization of a configuration space which is\na homogeneous space Q = G/H. Hence, there is a principal fibre bundle from which\nimportant information is extracted when constructing the corresponding quantum theory:\nH \u0592\u2192 G \u2192 G/H = Q.\n\n(28)\n\nThis point of view is particularly useful if one is interested in the quantum operators corresponding to the self-adjoint generators of the group G. There is, though, another possible\ne denote the\nroute, that puts more emphasis on the role of the fundamental group of Q. Let Q\nuniversal cover of Q. Then there is a fibration\ne \u2192 Q,\n\u03c01 (Q) \u0592\u2192 Q\n\n(29)\n\nfor which there are certain lifting theorems available. These theorems can be used to\ne \u00d7\u03c1 Ck , where \u03c1\nconstruct a lift of the G-action on Q to an associated vector bundle Q\nis an irreducible representation of \u03c01 (Q) on Ck . When the subgroup H is disconnected,\ninteresting quantum effects will appear (\"\u03b8 -states\") and, since they are closely related to\nthe non-triviality of \u03c01 (Q), the second approach provides an alternative and clear way to\ndescribe these effects.\n\n\f10\n\nANDR\u00c9S F. REYES-LEGA AND CARLOS BENAVIDES\n\n4. Q UANTIZATION OF\n\nTHE\n\nC ONFIGURATION S PACE\nPARTICLES\n\nOF\n\n2 I NDISTINGUISHABLE\n\n4.1. The configuration space. The configuration space for a system of N identical particles is not the Cartesian product R3N , but the space obtained by identifying points in R3N\nrepresenting the same physical configuration. Therefore, the configuration space can be\nwritten as\neN /SN ,\nQN = Q\n(30)\nwhere\n\b\neN = (r1 , ..., rN ) \u2208 R3N | ri 6= r j whenever i 6= j ,\n(31)\nQ\nand where SN is the permutation group. The non-coincidence condition i 6= j is included in\neN a manifold and to avoid the coincidence of two particles.\nthe definition in order to make Q\nRemark 2. The non-coincidence condition is a topologically non-trivial assumption. It\nis because of this fact that the fundamental group of QN is isomorphic to SN . It is known\nthat the only two possible scalar quantizations of QN are those that give rise to Fermi or\nBose statistics, and this in turn follows from the fact that Hom(\u03c01 (QN ),U(1)) has exactly\ntwo elements. For an interesting discussion on the physical status of this assumption, the\nreader is encouraged to consult [28].\n\nIn the case of two identical particles, we can consider a transformation to center of mass\nand relative coordinates:\n\u0001\n1\n(32)\n(~r1 ,~r2 ) 7\u2212\u2192 ~R = (~r1 +~r2 ),~r =~r1 \u2212~r2 .\n2\nThis transformation gives rise to a diffeomorphism R3 \u00d7 R3 \u223c\n= R3cm \u00d7 R3rel . The noncoincidence condition does not play any role for the center of mass position vector, whereas\nfor the relative position vector~r it implies~r 6= 0. For this reason, when imposing the none2 is diffeomorphic to R3 \u00d7 S2 \u00d7 R+ . The\ncoincidence condition, we see that the space Q\nfactor R+ accounts for the relative distance between the particles, i.e. we must have:\ne2 affects only the S2 factor. Hence,\nr =k~r k> 0. The action of the permutation group on Q\nwhen taking the quotient, we obtain:\nQ2 \u223c\n(33)\n= R3 \u00d7 RP2 \u00d7 R+ ,\nwhere RP2 is the two dimensional projective space, appearing here in the form S2 /Z2 .\nRemark 3. As remarked above, it is the fundamental group of the configuration space\nthat is responsible for the topological quantum effects we are interested in. Although one\ncould proceed to study the quantization of the whole configuration space Q2 , it will be\nmore convenient to isolate only the part of the canonical group that is of direct relevance\nfor our discussion. Nevertheless, it is important to emphasize that the implementation of\nIsham's method to the quantization of Q2 requires the use of some non-trivial additional\nmathematical results (see below).\nSince our aim is to construct the infinitesimal generators of rotations for this problem,\nit will be convenient to describe the configuration space as a homogeneous space for the\ngroup SU(2). Since RP2 is the quotient of a sphere with respect to the antipodal map, we\ncan use the fact that S2 \u223c\n= SU(2)/U(1) to obtain a diffeomorphism of the form SU(2)/H,\nwhere H is a disconnected group. The details of this construction are given in the appendix\nat the end of the paper, and the result is that if we consider the following subgroup of SU(2),\n\u001a\u0012\n\u0013 \u0012\n\u0013\n\u001b\n\u03bb 0\n0 \u03bb\u0304\n2\nH :=\n,\n| |\u03bb | = 1 ,\n(34)\n0 \u03bb\u0304\n\u2212\u03bb 0\n\n\fREMARKS ON THE CONFIGURATION SPACE APPROACH TO SPIN-STATISTICS\n\n11\n\nwe obtain RP2 \u223c\n= SU(2)/H. We denote the elements of SU(2) by tuples (z0 , z1 ) that represent matrices of the form\n\u0013\n\u0012\nz0 z\u03041\n.\n(35)\n\u2212z1 z\u03040\nLet us consider U(1) as the subgroup of SU(2) consisting of all diagonal matrices of the\nform diag(\u03bb , \u03bb\u0304 ), with |\u03bb | = 1. A right action of U(1) on SU(2) is then given by\n\u0013 \u0012\n\u0013\n\u0013\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0012\n\u03bb 0\nz0 z\u03041\nz0 z\u03041\n\u03bb z0\n(\u03bb z1 )\n=\n,\n(36)\n7\u2212\u2192\n\u2212z1 z\u03040\n\u2212z1 z\u03040\n0 \u03bb\u0304\n\u2212(\u03bb z1 ) (\u03bb z0 )\n\nthat can be equivalently expressed as (z0 , z1 ) 7\u2212\u2192 (z0 , z1 ) * \u03bb = (\u03bb z0 , \u03bb z1 ). Accordingly,\npoints in the quotient space SU(2)/U(1) \u223c\n= S2 will be denoted by [z0 : z1 ]. This allows us\n2\nto express points in RP as equivalence clases in S2 /Z2 , of the form [[z0 : z1 ]].\n\n4.2. The canonical group. For simplicity, we will only consider that part of the configuration space that corresponds to the relative motion of the particles. Therefore, let us\nconsider the manifold\nRP2 \u00d7 R+ .\n(37)\nThe symplectic space we must consider is therefore T \u2217 (RP2 \u00d7R+ ). The symplectic 2-form\nis therefore obtained, in a canonical way, from Liouville's 1-form, in the standard way. We\ncan use the fact that the projective space can be written as a quotient of SU(2) in order to\nconstruct the canonical group. The R+ factor will contribute to the canonical group with\ncertain \"dilation\" factors that pose no problem. But, if we want to apply the techniques\ndiscussed on section 3, (especially the techniques that apply for homogeneous spaces) we\nare confronted with the problem of finding a vector space W carrying a representation of\nSU(2) in such a way that RP2 can be realized as an SU(2)-orbit on W . Fortunately, there\na theorem, due to Palais [31] and Mostow [32], which guarantees that this can be done.\nThe idea is to regard the space C(RP2 ) as a representation space for SU(2). On then\nshows that it is possible to find an embedding F : RP2 \u2192 Rk , F(x) = ( f1 (x), . . . , fk (x)),\nwith the property that the vector spaces generated by the transformed functions g * f j , with\ng \u2208 SU(2), are all finite dimensional. The dual of the direct sum of this vector spaces\ncarries, by construction, a linear action of SU(2). It is finite dimensional and (this is the\nkey part) there is an SU(2) orbit on it which is diffeomorphic to RP2 . An explicit form\nfor the embedding is given (using homogeneous coordinates, with normalized entries), for\ninstance, by\nF([x : y : z]) := (yz, xz, xy, y2 \u2212 z2 ).\n(38)\nSince the component functions can be written as linear combinations of spherical harmonics, the embedding has the required properties and gives rise to a linear action R of SU(2)\non a vector space W having an orbit diffeomorphic to RP2 .

Explicit expressions for the infinitesimal generators. Having the above remarks\nin mind, let us proceed to obtain explicit expressions for the infinitesimal generators constructed in the previous section. We start by constructing an explicit isomorphism between\nthe bundle SU(2) \u00d7\u03ba C and the nontrivial line bundle L\u2212 of RP2 , regarded as a subbundle\nof the trivial bundle RP2 \u00d7 C3 \u2192 RP2 , as described below.\nUsing the standard homogeneous coordinates, we cover RP2 \u223c\n= S2 /Z2 with the following charts (\u03b1 = 1, 2, 3):\n(45)\nU\u03b1 = {[x] \u2208 RP2 | x\u03b1 6= 0}.\n\n\fREMARKS ON THE CONFIGURATION SPACE APPROACH TO SPIN-STATISTICS\n\nThe total space of L\u2212 is, as a set, given by:\n\b\n([x] , \u03bb |\u03c6 (x)i) \u2208 RP2 \u00d7 C3 | \u03bb \u2208 C and x \u2208 [x] ,\n\n13\n\n(46)\n\nwith\n\n|\u03c6 (\u2212)i : S2\nx\n\n\u2212\u2192 C3\n7\u2212\u2192 |\u03c6 (x)i\n\n(47)\n\nbeing any map from S2 to C3 satisfying the following conditions:\n(i) It is smooth.\n6 0 for all x \u2208 S2 .\n(ii) |\u03c6 (x)i =\n(iii) |\u03c6 (\u2212x)i = \u2212|\u03c6 (x)i for all x \u2208 S2 .\nThe bundle projection is defined through \u03c0 (( [x] , \u03bb |\u03c6 (x)i )) = [x]. According to (46), an\nelement in the total space of L\u2212 is given by a tuple of the form ([x], \u03bb |\u03c6 (x)i). Alternatively,\nwe can describe the bundle saying that the fiber over [x] is the subset {[x]} \u00d7 V[x] of RP2 \u00d7\nC3 , where V[x] is the vector space generated by the vector |\u03c6 (x)i \u2208 C3 . Local trivializations\nfor L\u2212 are given by (\u03b1 = 1, 2, 3):\n\n\u03c6\u03b1 : \u03c0 \u22121 (U\u03b1 ) \u2212\u2192 U\u03b1 \u00d7 C\n([x] , \u03bb |\u03c6 (x)i) 7\u2212\u2192 ([x] , sign(x\u03b1 )\u03bb ) .\n\n(48)\n\nThey give rise to the following transition functions:\ng\u03b1\u03b2 : U\u03b1 \u2229U\u03b1\n\n\u2212\u2192 Z2 6 U(1)\n\n[ x] 7\u2212\u2192 g\u03b1\u03b2 ([x]) = sign(x\u03b1 x\u03b2 ).\n\n(49)\n\nIf g = (z0 , z1 ) \u2208 SU(2) and v \u2208 C, then \u03c0\u03ba ([(g, v)]) = [[z0 : z1 ]] is a point in SU(2)/H. Let\nx(g) denote the point in S2 obtained from g through the quotient map SU(2) \u2192 SU(2)/U(1)\nand let [x(g)] denote the corresponding equivalence class, with respect to the quotient map\nS2 \u2192 S2 /Z2 . Then it is clear that \u03c0\u03ba ([(g, v)]) = [x(g)], independently of the chosen g. This\nfact allows us to construct the following isomorphism between the two bundles:\n\u03a6 : SU(2) \u00d7\u03ba C\n[(g, v)]\n\n\u2212\u2192\nL\u2212\n7\u2212\u2192 ([x(g)] , v |\u03c6 (x(g))i) .\n\n(50)\n\nUsing this isomorphism, we can \"transfer\" the lift to the bundle L\u2212 , as indicated in the\nfollowing diagram:\n\u03c4\n\ng\nL\u2212 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _/ L\u2212\nO\n\n\u03a6\n\n\u03a6\u22121\n\n\u000f\nSU(2) \u00d7\u03ba C\n\n\u2191\n\nlg\n\n\u03c0\u03ba\n\n\u000f\nRP2\n\n/ SU(2) \u00d7\u03ba C\n\u03c0\u03ba\n\nlg\n\n\u000f\n/ RP2\n(51)\n\n\f14\n\nANDR\u00c9S F. REYES-LEGA AND CARLOS BENAVIDES\n\nFrom \u03c4g = \u03a6 \u25e6 lg\u2191 \u25e6 \u03a6\u22121 we get, for g = (\u03b1 , \u03b2 ):\n\n\u03c4g ([x] , \u03bb |\u03c6 (x)i) = (\u03a6 \u25e6 lg\u2191 \u25e6 \u03a6\u22121 ) ([x] , \u03bb |\u03c6 (x)i)\n= (\u03a6 \u25e6 lg\u2191 ) [((z0 , z1 ) , \u03bb )]\n\n\u2032\n\n= \u03a6 [((\u03b1 , \u03b2 ) * (z0 , z1 ) , \u03bb )]\n\u0010h \u2032 \u2032 i\nE\u0011\n\u2032\n\u2032\n=\nx(z0 , z1 ) , \u03bb \u03c6 (x(z0 , z1 )) ,\n\n(52)\n\n\u2032\n\nwhere we have used the notation z0 = \u03b1 z0 \u2212 \u03b2\u0304 z1 and z1 = \u03b2 z0 + \u1fb1 z1 . Here, (z0 , z1 ) is\nchosen in such a way that x \u2261 x(z0 , z1 ) = [[z0 : z1 ]].\nNow, notice that a smooth section on L\u2212 can always be written in the form \u03a8([x ]) =\n([x] , a(x) |\u03c6 (x)i), with a : S2 \u2192 C a smooth antisymmetric function [12]. Such a section\ntransforms under the action of SU(2) in the following way:\n\u0002\n\u0003\n(U(g)\u03a8)([x]) := \u03c4g (\u03a8(g\u22121 * [x])) = \u03c4g ( g\u22121 * x , a(g\u22121 * x) \u03c6 (g\u22121 * x) )\n\u0001\n=\n[x] , a(g\u22121 * x) |\u03c6 (x)i .\n(53)\nFrom this we immediately see that the infinitesimal generators Ji are given by\n(Ji \u03a8)([x]) = ([x] , (Li a)(x) |\u03c6 (x)i) ,\n\n(54)\n\nwhere Li is the usual (orbital) angular momentum operator!\n5.2. Interpretation of the results in the light of the projective module approach. In\norder to interpret this result, let us make reference to the approach proposed in [15] and\nfurther developed in [5, 12, 14], where extensive use of the Serre-Swan equivalence of vector bundles and projective modules is made. Since the use of this equivalence is (perhaps)\nnot generally known in the context of non-relativistic quantum mechanics, the interested\nreader is referred to [5, 12, 14, 15] where many explicit calculations are carried out. In the\npresent case, given a (normalized) map |\u03c6 (\u2212)i satisfying properties (i)-(iii), it is possible\nto show that the projector p : [x] 7\u2192 |\u03c6 (x)ih\u03c6 (x)| gives rise to a finitely generated projective module p(A+3 ) over the algebra A+ of complex, continuous even functions over the\nsphere. It can be shown that this module is isomorphic to the A+ -module of sections on\nthe bundle L\u2212 : \u0393(L\u2212 ). Let us explain this in some detail.\nRegard the two-sphere S2 as the effective configuration space (space of normalized relative coordinates) for a system of two point particles in three spatial dimensions, excluding\ncoincidence points. Then, the configuration space for the two particles, when regarded as\nindistinguishable is the projective space RP2 . Using the fact that every even function on S2\ncan be regarded as a function on RP2 and vice versa, it is useful to consider the following\ndecomposition of the space C(S2 ) of complex continuous functions on the sphere:\nC(S2 ) = A+ \u2295 A\u2212 ,\n\n(55)\n\nwhere (as already mentioned) A+ denotes the subspace of even functions and A\u2212 denotes\nthe subspace of odd functions. Clearly, we must have the following algebra isomorphism:\nA+ \u223c\n= C(RP2 ),\nor, equivalently:\nEven functions on S2 can be regarded as functions on RP2 or, equivalently, as\nsections on the trivial line bundle L+ over RP2 .\n\n(56)\n\n\fREMARKS ON THE CONFIGURATION SPACE APPROACH TO SPIN-STATISTICS\n\n15\n\nOn the other hand, we have the following isomorphisms of finitely generated, projective\nA+ -modules:\n\u223c p(A 3 ) \u223c\n(57)\nA\u2212 =\n+ = \u0393(L\u2212 ),\nor, in other words,\nOdd functions on S2 can be regarded as sections on the non-trivial line bundle\nL\u2212 over RP2 .\nAccording to the quantization approach we have used in this paper, the Hilbert space of a\ntheory obtained from a classical configuration space Q will be given, in general, by (the\ncompletion of) some space of square integrable section on a given bundle over Q. That\nmeans that, in our present example, the two Hilbert spaces we obtain are given by (a suitable completion) of the section spaces \u0393(L+ ) and \u0393(L\u2212 ) (i.e. the Fermi-Bose alternative).\nBut each one of these \"pre\" Hilbert spaces is -in every respect- isomorphic, and hence carries exactly the same information, as the module A+ , respectively A\u2212 . Therefore, if we\nconsider the transformation properties of a wave function that is a section in L\u00b1 , we must\nobtain an equivalent transformation rule in the corresponding space A\u00b1 . The construction\nof infinitesimal generators for rotations that we have just performed is based on a rigorous\nquantization scheme. One is thus comforted to find that the angular momentum operators Ji obtained this way, as operators acting on \u0393(L\u2212 ), exactly match the usual angular\nmomentum operators Li , acting as differential operators on (the restriction to A\u2212 of) C(S2 ).\nTo be more explicit, let us call \u03a6 the A+ -module isomorphism between A\u2212 and \u0393(L\u2212 ).\nWith a fixed choice of |\u03c6 i, as described above, it is given by\n\u03a6 : A\u2212\na\n\n\u2212\u2192 \u0393(L\u2212 )\n7\u2212\u2192 \u03a8a ,\n\n(58)\n\nwhere \u03a8a ([x ]) := a(x)|\u03c6 (x)i. Notice that in spite of the fact that x 7\u2192 |\u03c6 (x)i cannot be\nregarded as a section of L\u2212 , the map [x ] 7\u2192 \u03a8a ([x ]) is a well defined section on L\u2212 . What\nour results indicate, then, is not only that the underlying linear spaces from which the corresponding Hilbert spaces are supposed to be constructed are mathematically equivalent,\nbut that the corresponding generators of symmetries do also coincide. In fact, (54) can now\nbe rewritten as follows: Ji (\u03a8a ) \u2261 \u03a8Li (a) or, in a more suggestive way:\nJi \u25e6 \u03a6 = \u03a6 \u25e6 Li .\n\n(59)\n\nLet us note that similar intertwining relations for angular momentum operators have been\nshown by Kuckert [4] to play an important role regarding the spin-statistics connection.\nIt would therefore be desirable to obtain a global version, along the lines explained in\nthe present paper, of his results. Recalling the remarks made in sections 2 and 3.1, we\nare led to believe that important information is being disregarded when studying the spinstatistics connection using the configuration space (30), namely, the implementation (by\nmeans of self-adjoint operators) of the angular momentum operators corresponding to the\ngenerators constructed above may involve some representation-theoretic and functional\nanalytic aspects that could be of importance. An example reinforcing our point of view is\ngiven by the careful consideration of the possible self-adjoint extensions of the Laplacian\non these configuration spaces (for two spatial dimensions), as carried out some time ago\nby Bourdeau and Sorkin [28].\n\n\f16\n\nANDR\u00c9S F. REYES-LEGA AND CARLOS BENAVIDES\n\n5.3. How the observable \"spin\" should be defined. As a motivation, let us begin this\nsubsection by considering the following elementary examples.\nSpin zero particle in three spatial dimensions:\nThe wave function of such a particle is a complex function \u03c8 : R3 \u2192 C. Since there are\nno internal degrees of freedom, the action of a rotation g \u2208 SU(2) on the wave function is\nsimply given by\n(60)\ng * \u03c8 (~r) = \u03c8 (g\u22121~r).\nNotice that, while the left hand side is being evaluated at the point ~r in space, the right\nhand side is being evaluated at a different point, namely, g\u22121~r. Whereas in this case this\ntransformation rule makes prefect sense, if the configuration space were a topologically\nnon trivial manifold, such that the more general possibility of defining the wave function\nas a section on a non trivial bundle would exist, the above rule would not make sense.\nWhat one needs to correct that rule in the general case is a lift l \u2191 of the SU(2) action to\nthe bundle. As we have seen, in the case of two identical spin zero particles there are two\npossibilities for the quantum theory. The one corresponding to Fermi statistics (i.e. the one\ngiving the wrong spin-statistics connection) is implemented on a Hilbert space of sections\non a non trivial line bundle. Hence we see that, even if the particle do not have spin, a lift\nto the total space will be generally needed.\nThe next example is intended to show that the transformation properties for one particle\nof spin 1/2 already include a lift, although the bundle in this case is a trivial bundle.\nSpin 1/2 particle in three spatial dimensions:\nIn this case the Hilbert space is given by\nH = L2 (R3 ) \u2297 C2.\n\n(61)\n\nThe spin state space C2 has a basis {|+i, |\u2212i}, with respect to which the wave function\ncan be written:\n\u03c8 = \u03c8+ \u2297 |+i + \u03c8\u2212 \u2297 |\u2212i,\nwith \u03c8+ and \u03c8\u2212 position dependent functions. The spin operators S\u00b1 , S3 , proportional to\nthe Pauli matrices, furnish a representation of the Lie algebra su(2), acting on C2 :\nS\u2213 |\u00b1i =\n\n|\u2213i\n\nS\u00b1 |\u00b1i =\n\n0\n\n(62)\n1\nS3 |\u00b1i = \u00b1 |\u2213i.\n2\nThese matrices, together with the angular momentum operators Li , give rise to the infinitesimal generators of rotations, acting on H , by angular momentum addition:\nJi = Li \u2297 IdC2 + IdL2 (R3 ) \u2297 Si .\n\n(63)\n\nBy exponentiation of Li and Si we obtain representations of the rotation group SU(2) on\nL2 (R3 ) and C2 , respectively. Explicitly (g \u2208 SU(2)), we have:\n(g * \u03c8\u00b1)(~r) =\ng * |\u00b1i =\n\n\u03c8\u00b1 (g\u22121 *~r)\nD 1/2 (g)|\u00b1i,\n\nwhere D 1/2 (g) are the usual rotation (Wigner) matrices. Thus, the transformation of the\ncomplete wave function under finite rotations is given by \u03c8 \u2192 g * \u03c8 , with g * \u03c8 defined by:\n(g * \u03c8 )(~r) := D (1/2) (g)(\u03c8 (g\u22121 *~r)).\n\n(64)\n\n\fREMARKS ON THE CONFIGURATION SPACE APPROACH TO SPIN-STATISTICS\n\n17\n\nIn this case, the wave function can be regarded as a vector valued map \u03c8 : R3 \u2192 C2 or,\nequivalently, as a section \u03c3\u03c8 on the trivial vector bundle with total space given by R3 \u00d7 C2 .\nThe section corresponding to \u03c8 is then given by\n\n\u03c3\u03c8 (~r) := (~r, \u03c8 (~r)).\n\n(65)\n\nLooking back at (25), we see that by regarding the wave function as a section of the (trivial)\nbundle R3 \u00d7 C2 \u2192 R3 , the transformation rule (64) is the one induced by the following lift:\nl \u2191 : SU(2) \u00d7 (R3 \u00d7 C2 ) \u2212\u2192 (R3 \u00d7 C2 )\n(g, (~r, v))\n\n7\u2212\u2192\n\nlg\u2191 (~r, v)\n\n:= (g *~r, D\n\n(66)\n(1/2)\n\n(g)v).\n\nWe thus recognize that this familiar case also fits in the general scheme discussed in the\nprevious sections. Moreover, this shows that, in order to define the transformation properties of a wave function which is given by a section in a (possibly non trivial) vector bundle\nover the configuration space, all we need is to find a lift of the group action to the total\nspace of the bundle. This can have interesting effects. For example, in the case of a scalar2\nparticle Q = S2 , the behavior under rotations of the wave function can have fermionic character, according to the (induced) representation of SU(2) chosen. In that case, this is a\nconsequence of the non triviality of the bundle [13].\nMotivated by the rigorous result obtained by application of Isham's method to the case\nof spin zero particles, we thus propose:\nThe correct definition of spin operators for a system of N indistinguishable\nparticles must involve a lift of the SU(2)-action on the configuration space QN\nto the vector bundle where the wave functions are defined.\nIn the next subsection we will show how this definition fits perfectly with the definition\ngiven by Berry and Robbins in [2].\n5.4. Relation with the Berry-Robbins approach. Let us now briefly comment on how\nour approach relates to the one of Berry and Robbins [2]. In this approach, spin vectors are\nposition dependent, giving rise to a transported spin basis. The transition from the fixed\nspin basis to the transported one is effected through the action of a position dependent\nunitary operator U(~r). Momentum as well as spin operators are also obtained from the\n\"fixed\" operators, and thus required to depend on position. In particular, the infinitesimal\ngenerators for spin angular momentum are given by\nSi (~r) := U(~r)SiU \u2020 (~r).\n\n(67)\n\nIn the present paper we have only considered the spin zero case. Nevertheless, it becomes\napparent that for general values of spin, the appropriate definition of (spin) angular momentum operators should involve the structure of a SU(2)-bundle. What the SU(2) lift that\nwe have considered for the spin zero case accomplishes is, for a given g \u2208 SU(2), to generate the transport of a vector in the fiber over a given point q to some other vector, lying\nin the fiber over the image point lg (q). It can be shown [12] that, for g close to the identity\nof the group, parallel transport (with respect to the canonically given flat connection on\nthe bundle) of the vector from the fiber over q to the fiber over lg (q), coincides with the\naction of the lift, lg\u2191 , on the given vector. This can be recognized in (52) from the effect\nof the lift on elements of the total space of L\u2212 , because ([x], \u03bb |\u03c6 (x)i) gets mapped to\n2In the sense of having spin zero\n\n\f18\n\nANDR\u00c9S F. REYES-LEGA AND CARLOS BENAVIDES\n\n(lg ([x]), \u03bb |\u03c6 (g * x)i). Were we considering spin degrees of freedom, we would have more\n\"transported vectors\" of the type |\u03c6 i. They would play the role of the transported spin\nbasis of Berry and Robbins. Then, the effect of a rotation would include, apart from this\n\"parallel transport rotation\", an instrinsic rotation within each fiber. This is precisely what\nthe transported spin operators Si (~r) accomplish. In the construction of Berry and Robbins,\nparallel transport is effected by the operator U(~r). Thus, we can recast the action of SU(2)\non wave functions in that construction as follows. Let us denote with | j, m(~r)i the transported spin vectors, written in the total angular momentum basis. If \u03b7 s is the vector bundle\n(constructed as a sub-bundle of a trivial bundle of higher rank) over the sphere, whose\nfibers over ~r is the vector space spanned by all the vectors | j, m(~r)i (~r being kept fixed),\nthen we can define the following lift of the SU(2) action on the sphere:\n!\n!\nlg\u2191 :\n\nr , \u2211 \u03bb j,m | j, m(r)i\nj,m\n\n7\u2212\u2192\n\ng * r , \u2211 \u03bb j,mU(g * r)D j (g)U(r)\u2020 | j, m(r)i .\n\n(68)\n\nj,m\n\nFollowing the prescriptions indicated in (25) and (27), it is then possible to recover the\nspin operators Si (~r) from the above defined lift. This shows that construction of Berry and\nRobbins also fits into the framework described in this paper.\nFinally, we would like to contribute to clarify a point that, to our opinion, has been\nmisinterpreted. Recently, Allen and Mondragon [18] have criticized the proposal made by\nPeshkin in [7] (for Peshkin's reply, see [30]). While we do agree that Peshkin's construction contains a flaw in the argumentation, we do not share the opinion of those authors (and\nothers, like in [19]) who (referring to recent work on spin-statistics, particularly to [7] and\n[2]) claim that \"..quantum mechanics is modified so as to force a spin-statistics connection,\nbut the resulting theory is quite different from standard physics\". In this paper, we have\ntried to motivate and to explain why we believe such claims are completely unsubstantiated.\nFrom the remarks on the previous sections, it is completely clear that quantum mechanics can be consistently formulated on a great variety of configuration spaces. While these\nschemes have, with time, grown to be full-fledged mathematical theories and so, many\ninteresting examples do not seem to have a direct physical interpretation or application,\nschemes like Isham's one go to the very heart of quantum mechanics and provide useful\nand physically sensible results and insights. In particular, the equivalence between A\u00b1 and\n\u0393(L\u00b1 ) has been extended in this paper to include the infinitesimal generators of rotations.\nThus, while it is true that taking the indistinguishability of particles into account already at\nthe level of the configuration space makes the analysis of the corresponding quantum theory more complicated, due to the non-trivial topology of the configuration space, a detailed\nstudy of the respective quantum theory shows that we can keep exactly the same textbook\nformalism of quantum mechanics, with the conceptual difference that the Fermi-Bose alternative (at least for spin zero particles) and with it the symmetrization postulate, do not\nneed to be imposed \"by hand\".\n6. C ONCLUSIONS\nIn this work we have considered the canonical group quantization of the projective space\nRP2 , as a model for the quantum theory of two non-relativistic spin zero identical particles. The approach has been motivated by a discussion of the relevance of commutation\nrelations for the formulation of a quantum theory based on a classical configuration space.\nThe main focus has been on the construction of the infinitesimal generators of rotations.\nThe operators obtained have been used to complete the equivalence already established between the spaces of wave functions on the sphere and spaces of sections on the projective\n\n\fREMARKS ON THE CONFIGURATION SPACE APPROACH TO SPIN-STATISTICS\n\n19\n\nspace. The connection of our formalism with different approaches has been established\nand discussed.\nA PPENDIX A.\nThe projective plane RP2 can be represented as the quotient SO(3)/O(2), where O(2)\nis the group of orthogonal transformations. This group can be written as the union of two\ndisjoint sets: The matrices with determinant 1 and the matrices with determinant \u22121. Then,\nin order to show that the projective space is a homogeneous space, we write the orthogonal\ngroup O(2) as a subgroup of SO(3):\n\uf8f1\uf8eb\n\uf8fc\n\uf8f6 \uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n0\n\u2212 cos \u03c6 sin \u03c6\n\uf8f2 cos \u03c6 \u2212 sin \u03c6 0\n\uf8fd\n\uf8ed sin \u03c6\ncos \u03c6 0 \uf8f8 , \uf8ed sin \u03c6\ncos \u03c6\n0 \uf8f8 | 0 \u2264 \u03c6 \u2264 2\u03c0 .\n\uf8f3\n\uf8fe\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n\u22121\nSince this is a subgroup of SO(3), by means of the \"spinor map\" (here we follow the\nnotation from [29]), we can associate each matrix in O(2) with a matrix in SU(2). In fact,\nthe homomorphism\nSpin : SU(2) \u2192 SO(3)\nu(\u03c8 , n\u0302)\n\n\u2192 R(\u03c8 , n\u0302),\n\n(69)\n\nrelates each matrix in SU(2) to a matrix in SO(3), where\nu(\u03c8 , n\u0302)\n\n= cos(\u03c8 /2)Id \u2212 i sin(\u03c8 /2)(x\u03c3x + y\u03c3y + z\u03c3z )\n\u0012\n\u0013\ncos(\u03c8 /2) \u2212 i sin(\u03c8 /2)z \u2212y sin(\u03c8 /2) \u2212 ix sin(\u03c8 /2)\n=\n.\ny sin(\u03c8 /2) \u2212 ix sin(\u03c8 /2)\ncos(\u03c8 /2) + i sin(\u03c8 /2)z\n\nEvery rotation can be parameterized by an axis of rotation n\u0302 = (x, y, z), with |x|2 + |y|2 +\n|z|2 = 1, and an angle of rotation about this axis, \u03c8 . Then, we can write every matrix in the\nrotation group R(\u03c8 , n\u0302) by\nR(\u03c8 , n\u0302) = e\u03c8 N = Id + (sin \u03c8 )N + (1 \u2212 cos \u03c8 )N 2 ,\nwhere Id is the identity matrix and\n\n(70)\n\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8f6\n0 \u2212z y\n0 \u2212x \uf8f8\nN=\uf8ed z\n\u2212y x\n0\n\nis a skew-symmetric matrix lying in the Lie algebra so(3), with the following properties:\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n\u2212(y2 + z2 )\nxy\nxz\n\uf8f8\nN2 = \uf8ed\nxy\n\u2212(x2 + z2 )\nyz\nxz\nyz\n\u2212(x2 + y2 )\n\nand N 3 = \u2212N, N 4 = \u2212N 2 , N 5 = N, etc.. The matrix R(\u03c8 , n\u0302) arises from geometrical\nconsiderations. It is, in fact, the rotation through an angle \u03c8 about an axis along n\u0302.\nIn fact, using (70) we can find an angle \u03c8 and a unit vector n\u0302 such that\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\ncos \u03c6 \u2212 sin \u03c6 0\n\uf8ed sin \u03c6\ncos \u03c6 0 \uf8f8 = Id + (sin \u03c8 )N + (1 \u2212 cos \u03c8 )N 2 .\n0\n0\n1\nThe equation for the element R33 is 1 = 1 \u2212 (1 \u2212 cos \u03c8 )(x2 + y2 ). Then, x2 + y2 = 0. Since\nthis is the sum of two positive numbers, the only solution is x = y = 0. This implies that\n\n\f20\n\nANDR\u00c9S F. REYES-LEGA AND CARLOS BENAVIDES\n\nz2 = 1, and we choose, for reasons to become clear in the next step, z = \u22121. Finally, the\nequation for the element R11 is cos \u03c6 = 1 \u2212 (1 \u2212 cos \u03c8 ); then \u03c8 = \u03c6 . The conclusion is\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\ncos \u03c6 \u2212 sin \u03c6 0\n\uf8ed sin \u03c6\ncos \u03c6 0 \uf8f8 = R(\u03c6 , (\u22121, 0, 0)).\n0\n0\n1\nThe corresponding matrix in SU(2) is, then:\n\u0012 i\u03c6 /2\n\u0013\n0\ne\n.\n0\ne\u2212i\u03c6 /2\n\n(71)\n\nIn the same way, we can also find an angle \u03c8 and a unit vector n\u0302 such that\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n0\n\u2212 cos \u03c6 sin \u03c6\n\uf8ed sin \u03c6\ncos \u03c6\n0 \uf8f8 = Id + (sin \u03c8 )N + (1 \u2212 cos \u03c8 )N 2 .\n0\n0\n\u22121\n\nThis matrix to the square is equal to the identity. We can use this fact to find the value of\nthe angle:\n\u0002\n\u00032\nId = Id + (sin \u03c8 )N + (1 \u2212 cos \u03c8 )N 2 = Id + sin \u03c8 (sin \u03c8 + 1 \u2212 2 cos \u03c8 )N 2 .\n\nThe equality is satisfied if sin \u03c8 = 0, so \u03c8 = \u03c0 . The equation for the element R33 is\n\u22121 = 1 \u2212 2(x2 + y2 ), and the conclusion is that x2 + y2 = 1; it follows that z = 0. Finally,\nthe equations for the elements R11 and R22 are:\n\u2212 cos \u03c6\n\n= 1 \u2212 2y2\n\n(72)\n\nsin \u03c6\n\n2\n\n(73)\n\n= 1 \u2212 2x ,\n\nthen we have that x = sin(\u03c6 /2) and y = cos(\u03c6 /2). The conclusion is\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n0\n\u2212 cos \u03c6 sin \u03c6\n\uf8ed sin \u03c6\ncos \u03c6\n0 \uf8f8 = R(\u03c0 , (cos(\u03c6 /2), cos(\u03c6 /2), 0)).\n0\n0\n\u22121\n\nThe corresponding matrix in SU(2) is, then:\n\u0012\n\u0013\n0\niei\u03c6 /2\n.\n\u2212ie\u2212i\u03c6 /2\n0\n\n(74)\n\nFrom the explicit calculations above, it is now clear that the projective space can also be\nwritten as the homogeneous space SU(2)/H, where\n\u0013\n\u001b\n\u0013 \u0012\n\u001a\u0012\n\u03bb 0\n0 \u03bb\u0304\n2\n| |\u03bb | = 1 ,\n,\nH=\n\u2212\u03bb 0\n0 \u03bb\u0304\n\nis a subgroup of SU(2).
