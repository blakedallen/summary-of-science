The lattice model [1] suggests that at large distance between quarks, the interaction increases approximately linearly with separation. The bag model, where quarks and\ngluons are confined in a bag, is not suitable for calculating the hadronic properties of\nheavy quarks or in computing the energy levels of excited states. String model, on the\nother hand, proposes quark-antiquark pair at the ends of an open string and creation\nof quark-antiquark pair when the string breaks. In recent years, potential models [2] are\nbest justified theoretically to describe heavy quarkonia and seem to be most powerful in\ncalculating the static properties.\nSeveral authors [3 - 6] have addressed the bound states of various kinds of linear\npotential. Chiu [7] has examined the quarkonium systems with the regulated linear\nplus Coulomb potential in momentum space. Deloff [8] has used a semi-spectral Chebyshev method for numerically solving integral equations and has applied the same to the\nquarkonium bound state problem in momentum space.\nRao and Kagali [9 - 11] have investigated extensively the bound states of both spin\nand spinless particles in a screened Coulomb potential, having linear behaviour near the\norigin. In the present work, we propose a finite, short-ranged linearly rising potential,\nenvisaged as a quark-confining potential and explore the non-relativistic bound states.\n\n2\n\nThe Schrodinger equation with the linear potential\n\nSeveral attempts have been made to study the meson spectra using the non-relativistic\nSchrodinger equation with a linear potential. Intuitively, we construct a simple linear\nrising, finite range potential of the form [12]\nV (x) = \u2212\n\nV0\n(a \u2212 |x|) ,\na\n\n(1)\n\nin which the well depth V0 and range 2a are positive and adjustable parameters. The\nlinear potential with its boundary regions is illustrated in Fig.1 and owing to its shape,\nthis potential could also be called the trianglular potential well.\nObviously in regions I and IV, the particle is free and the allowed solutions of the\nfree particle Schrodinger equation are\n\u03c81 (x) = C1 e\u03b1x\n\n\u2212 \u221e < x \u2264 \u2212a\n\n(2)\n\n\f3\n\u03c84 (x) = C6 e\u2212\u03b1x\n\na \u2264 x < \u221e,\n\n(3)\n\nconsistent with the requirement \u03c8(x) vanishes as |x| \u2192 \u221e.\n2mE\nis implied. Since E < 0 for bound states, \u03b1 is positive. To discuss\nh\u0304 2\nthe nature of the soution within the potential region, \u2212a < x < a, we insert the potential\ndescribed in Eqn.(1) in the celebrated Schrodinger equation and obtain\nHere \u03b12 = \u2212\n\n\"\n\n|x|\nd2 \u03c8 2m\n+ 2 E + V0 1 \u2212\n2\ndx\na\nh\u0304\n\n!#\n\n\u03c8(x) = 0.\n\n(4)\n\nx\nE\nV\nSetting a = y and defining \u0112 = 2\nand V\u0304o = 2 o 2 we obtain the dimensionless\n2\nh\u0304 /2ma\nh\u0304 /2ma\nform of the Schrodinger equation\ni\nd2 \u03c8(y) h\n+\n\u0112\n+\nV\u0304\n(1\n\u2212\ny)\n\u03c8(y) = 0,\n0\ndy 2\n\n(5)\n\nwhich may further be written as\nd2 \u03c8\n\u2212 Ay\u03c8 + B\u03c8 = 0.\ndy 2\n\n(6)\n\nThe constants A = V\u03040 and B = \u0112 + V \u03040 are also dimensionless.

It\nis well-known in quantum mechanics that bound states exist for all atractive potentials,\nthe exact number depending on the specific form of the potential and the dimensionality\nof the space.\nMore specifically, as is seen from the spectrum of energies listed in Table 1, for a\nfinite range of the potential, deeper wells admit excited state energies, consistent with the\nwisdom of quantum mechanics. Such studies, apart from being pedagogical in nature,\nare potentially exciting and significant as it is concerned with quark confinement.\n\n\f6\nQuantum chromodynamics, which governs the quark-antiquark interaction is widely\naccepted as a good theory of strongly interacting particles. One can explore the hadronic\nproperties by investigating the bound states of quarks. Our investigation concerning the\nlinear potential is seeming interesting and can be regarded as a model to describe the\nquarkonia.\nFurther, the linear potential well or in other words, the triangular well has potential\napplications in electronics. Interestingly, in many semiconductor devices, it is believed\nthat electrons are confined in almost triangular quantum wells [15]. Examples of such\ndevices are Si MOSFETs (Metal Oxide Semiconductor Field Effect Transistors) widely\nused in digital applications and GaAs/AlGaAs MODFETs (Modulation Doped Field\nEffect Transistors) used for high speed applications. The bound states of the linear\npotential is a subject of renewed interest and intensive research and we have extended\nthe study of this naive potential to the relativistic domain, which will be reported shortly.\n\nAcknowledgements\nThis work was carried out under a grant and fellowship by the University Grants\nCommission.\n\n\f7\n\nReferences\n[1] Kogut J and Susskind L 1975 Hamiltonian formulation of Wilson's lattice guage\ntheories Phys.Rev D 11 395\n[2] Lichtenberg D B 1987 Energy levels of quarkonia in potential models Int.J.Mod.Phys.\nA 2 1669\n[3] Antippa A F and Phares A J 1978 The linear potential: A solution in terms of\ncombinatorics functions J.Math.Phys 19 308\n[4] Antippa A F and Toan N K 1979 The linear potential eigen energy equation I\nCan.J.Phys. 57 417\n[5] Plante G and Antippa A F 2005 Analytic solution of the Schrodinger equation for\nthe Coulomb plus linear potential - The wave functions J.Math.Phys. 46 062108\n[6] Antonio de Castro 2003 Bound states by a pseudoscalar Coulomb potential in one\nplus one dimension arXiv:hepth/0303 175v2\n[7] Chiu T W 1986 Non-relativistic bound state problems in momentum space J.Phys.A\nMath.Gen.19 2537\n[8] Deloff A 2007 Quarkonium bound state problem in momentum space revisted Ann.Phys.\n322 2315\n[9] Nagalakshmi A Rao and Kagali B A 2002 Spinless particles in a screened Coulomb\npotential Phys.Lett.
