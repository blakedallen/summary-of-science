It was almost doubled during the last 4 years, since the first 1998 SDPD round robin (RR) [12]. Four years ago, the routine solution of 15-30 non-hydrogen atom structures from powder data\nwas not demonstrated at the SDPDRR-1. If more than 70 potential participants downloaded the\ndata, only two solutions were provided (by using the DASH program and the CSD package software descriptions and Internet hyperlinks can be found at the CCP14 [4]) for the pharmaceutical\nsample (~30 non-H atoms), and none for the inorganic one (15 non-H atoms). Four years later, we\nobserve that the number of structures solved by SDPD remains below 100 per annum, in spite of an\nexplosion of the number of different software available for powder structure solution, commercial\nas well as in the public domain or even open source (see a random uncomplete software list in the\nlogo above, suggesting that a user could be lost in the maze and could ignore which button to press).\nBy the end of the XIXth IUCr congress (Geneva, August 2002), it was thus considered timely to\nverify if SDPD on demand had really become routine, meaning that software in other hands than\nthose of their developers would produce solutions with some regularity and ease.\n\nSamples and schedule\nThe first SDPD Round Robin was made knowing the cell and space group parameters. Thus, the\nindexing \"bottleneck\" was avoided. A few IUCr 2002 Geneva congress attendees were expecting\nfor an indexing round robin, The SDPDRR-2 was thus organized in two steps [3] :\n1- Indexing - September 9 to October 13, 2002 - 8 powder patterns\n2- Structure solution and refinement - September 9 to November 17, 2002 - 3 powder patterns\nThe results of the indexing step were disclosed October 14, 2002, because experts in indexing could\nbe different from experts in structure solution. Owing to the presupposed larger difficulty at step 2,\nonly the first three of the eight powder patterns to be indexed at step 1 had to be considered for the\nstructure solution step 2. The sample description was the following :\nSample 1 - probable formula Al2F10[C6N4H20] - probable impurity : pyrochlore structure, cubic,\nFd3m, a ~ 9.8 A, with possible formula Al(F,OH)3.xH2O - Cartesian coordinates provided for the\nC6N4H20 molecule, as found in C6N4H20.Cl4 - crystal chemistry : the usual behaviour of Al in F\nenvironment is to form AlF6 octahedra - reflection laboratory X-ray data from a Bruker D8\nAdvance diffractometer, CuKalpha, recorded from a micro sample (40 mg).\nSample 2 - probable formula Sr5V3(F/O/OH/H2O)22 - capillary synchrotron data, \u03bb = 0.79764 \u00c5.\nSample 3 - probable formula C61Br2 - Cartesian coordinates provided for the C60 molecule capillary synchrotron data, \u03bb = 0.79764 \u00c5.\nSample 4 - probable formula C20H12O6 - capillary synchrotron data, \u03bb = 0.79776 \u00c5.\nSample 5 - probable formula C16H26O6 - capillary synchrotron data, \u03bb = 0.79776 \u00c5.\n\n\fSample 6 - probable formula C21H15Bi2O9 - capillary synchrotron data, \u03bb = 0.79764 \u00c5.\nSample 7 - probable formula C7H5BiO4 - capillary synchrotron data, \u03bb = 0.79764 \u00c5.\nSample 8 - probable formula Rb7Cr6F25 - reflection laboratory X-ray data from a Bruker D8\nAdvance diffractometer, CuKalpha.\nThe hunt for accurate peak positions is software- and user-dependent. The round robin participants\nwere encouraged to use the software of their choice, though a list of peak positions was provided for\neach sample, obtained by using PowderX in default peak finding mode. At step 1, we expected only\none cell proposal from every participants, for each sample (or at least for samples 1-3 from people\nmaking SDPDs routinely), together with the list of indexed peaks, and figures of merit, the name of\nthe software (for indexing and peak position hunting), a statement telling if the cell was ascertained\nby applying CHEKCELL or/and a whole pattern fitting decomposition program (if yes, the software\nname and the method name - Pawley or Le Bail fit, etc), and finally a space group proposal (telling\nif estimated manually or with a software help, giving the software name, if any), plus explanations\njudged necessary (use of databases like CSD, ICSD, ICDD, etc). However, giving a list of possible\nunchecked cells ordered by decreasing value of figures of merit was accepted too. Robin Shirley\npassed on CDT files (converted from the PowderX peak list) ready for using the CRYSFIRE suite\n(which links to over eight indexing programs). One can note that a new Monte Carlo indexing\nsoftware (McMaille) was born during the round robin and that improvements of Index, by Joerg\nBergmann, were proposed. For step 2, all details of the structure solution and refinement were\nexpected to be provided by the participants into a form available at the SDPDRR-2 Web site [3].\nSlightly more than 100 participants downloaded the data.\n\nResults and discussion\nA citation is appropriate, from a chapter of the recent book Structure Determination from\nPowder Diffraction Data [5] : \"Sadly, despite the excellent quality of synchrotron data and the\ningenuity of the scientists who collect it, not all structures can be solved. Every laboratory has a\nsupply of powder data sets which stubbornly refuse to yield to structure solution. It is the existence\nof these sets that will act as a continual challenge to both instrumental and algorithmic\ndevelopments.\" We completely subscribe to that statement. It suggests that the more than 600\nstructures determined ab initio from powder diffraction during the last 20 years are the tip of the\niceberg. SDPD is known to be quite difficult, but scientists are secret about their failures, so that\nSDPD could even be much more difficult than usually said. It was thus decided to include in this\nsecond SDPD round robin some of those (splendid) \"data sets which stubbornly refuse to yield to\nstructure solution.\" These are samples 4-8 for which we had no structure solution, so that the cell\nproposals themselve cannot be confirmed. Of course, some samples having known (unpublished)\nsolutions were also incorporated (samples 1 to 3).\nStep 1 : The indexing bottleneck - Six participants sent results in due time for the step 1, giving\ngenerally cell parameters for sample 1 to 3. Only one participant suggested cell parameters for some\nsamples (5, 7 and 8) of the supplementary series 4 to 8. These contributions appeared so scarce (6%\nreturn rate) that it was announced that post-deadline proposals will be accepted.\nTable 1 - Participant (Pn) cell proposals to samples 1-8 (Sn).\nS1\n\nS2\n\nS3\n\nP1\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nP2\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nP3\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nS4\n\nS5\n\nS6\n\nS7\n\nS8\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nP4\nP5\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nP6\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\n\fFor samples 1-2, all the returned cell proposals were correct (sample 1, monoclinic : a = 10.323 \u00c5,\nb = 7.395 \u00c5, c = 8.535 \u00c5, \u03b2 = 91.29\u00b0; sample 2, monoclinic : a = 11.239 \u00c5, b = 8.194 \u00c5,\nc = 19.943 \u00c5, \u03b2 = 106.727\u00b0). Sample 3 is cubic (a = 18.88 \u00c5), it was proposed by three of the five\nparticipants having sent a cell proposal, while the two remaining ones proposed a tetragonal subcell\n(possibly due to default volume restrictions in the software used - but an application of the LePage\nalgorithm via Chekcell should have revealed the error). Software or program suites used were\nCRYSFIRE (P1, P3), DICVOL (P2), ITO (P4), Index (P5) and X-Cell (P6).\nFor samples 4 to 8, only one response was obtained in due time for three of the five data - using the\nIndex software of Joerg Bergmann [6]. More Post-deadline results were sent by participants 5 and 6\n(the latter using the X-Cell software [7]). In the absence of any crystal structure, we cannot confirm\nnor invalidate these cell proposals. These samples 4-8 are part of the great mass of iceberg under the\nsurface.\nTable 2 - Post-deadline cell proposals to samples 1-8 :\nS1\n\nS2\n\nS3\n\nS4\n\nS5\n\nP5\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nP6\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nS6\nX\n\nS7\n\nS8\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nIt appears that powder indexing is not easy and not routine. It is known since three decades that bad\ndata are the main cause of indexing failures. \"Bad\" data means both inaccurate and impure. Efforts\nare made in some indexing software in order to be more efficient with at least a two-phases mixture,\nsince inaccuracy can be fought by more efforts at the recording step for well crystallized samples.\nHowever, the main problem is that an indexing software user may not have the information that the\ndata are either inaccurate or impure or both.\nNowadays, indexing is not only using an indexing software which may produce several different\ncells with neighbouring figures of merit. The whole suite of operations after recording a powder\npattern and after failing to identify any known compound (search/match process [8]) is (under\nbrackets are given the techniques/software selected by the participants) : peak search [PowderX - as\nprovided with the round robin data; WinPlotr; CMPR], indexing sensu stricto [see list above], cell\nreduction [LePage], visual checking and more [Chekcell], whole pattern fit checking [Fullprof;\nRietica; Materials Studio; Pawley/Le Bail methods], space group proposal [Chekcell, Materials\nStudio, manual]. The cell proposals have to be checked against the whole pattern, not only the 2030 first peak positions, and this produces cell parameters refinement as well as more data for\nestimating systematic extinctions from which one or several possible space groups are deduced. The\nnext step (structure solution) can be quite time-consuming, so that a powder diffractionist will not\nmake any further effort if the probability to have found the true cell and space group is not high\n(this is a question of self-convincing, as indexing is still considered as an art).\nStep 2 - Structure solution and refinement - Two participants sent successful results for samples\n1 and 2 (none for sample 3). This is no more than for the SDPDRR-1 in 1998. The software used\nare FOX (P2) [9] and TOPAS (P7) [10].\nTable 3 - Participant (Pn) structure proposals to samples 1-3.\nS1\n\nS2\n\nP2\n\nX\n\nX\n\nP7\n\nX\n\nX\n\nS3\n\nParticipant 2 solved the sample 1 structure by using FOX according to the following strategy :\nstructural units location in direct space by simulated annealing in the parallel tempering mode.\nThree independent entities (two AlF6 octahedra and the C6N4H20 molecule) were allowed to rotate\n\n\fand move in the P2/c space group, corresponding to 18 degrees of freedom. The final refinement\nwas made by using the FULLPROF software. Much more details are given by the participants at the\nSDPDRR-2 Web site [3].\nParticipant 7 solved the sample 1 structure by using TOPAS according to the following strategy :\nmolecule location in direct space, simulated annealing, structure determination using step intensity\ndata, starting with 3 \"rigid\" bodies (including 2 for AlF6 octahedra). For the C6N4H20 molecule, 3\nrotational and 3 translational degrees of freedom and 4 torsion angles were used.\nParticipant 2 solved the sample 2 structure with FOX in a similar way as for sample 1 : either 3\ntetrahedra VO4 and 5 cubes SrO8 or 3 octahedra VO6 and 5 cubes SrO8 were rotated and translated\n(48 degrees of freedom in both cases). Both models have yielded the same correct positions for the\ncations. The positions of anions were determined by third modeling using free atoms.\nParticipant 7 solve the sample 2 structure with TOPAS by putting into the cell 30 independent atoms\n(no constraint/restraint) at random positions, locating them by simulated annealing.\nComputer programs used by the organizers for the step 1 (indexing) were TREOR, DICVOL, ITO,\nCRYSFIRE, McMaille, and for step 2 (structure solution) SHELXS (sample 2) and ESPOIR (samples\n1 and 3). Sample 1 was solved in the Pc space group by using 3 objects in the ESPOIR program\n(one AlF6 octahedron, one AlF4 square plane and the C6N4 molecule - fig. 1). SHELXS solved the\nsample 2 structure by direct methods, quite easily. ESPOIR could also solve the sample 2 structure\nin \"scratch\" mode (all atom random at the beginning, going to their right place by Monte Carlo - fig.\n2). Sample 3 could not be \"solved\" unless a global scattering factor for a sphere was used for\nmodelling a C60 disorder. The Br atoms appeared located partially at 2 positions in the I-43m space\ngroup (fig. 3).\n\nFig. 1 - Projection of the sample 1 structure along\nthe b axis (H atoms not represented)\n\nFig. 3 - The C60CBr2 mean structure model for\nsample 3. Big spheres represent the C60\nmolecules. Small spheres are the Br atoms.\n\nFig. 2 - Projection of the sample 2 structure along\nthe b axis.\n\nFig. 4 - Molecular formula for sample 7.\n\n\fThe SDPDRR-2 is still open for post-deadline structure solution results for samples 4-8. More\ndetails can be found on these samples which could help. For instance, sample 7 is a commercial\nbismuth sub-salicylate [CAS : 14882-18-9] whose formula C7H5BiO4 can also be found written as :\n2-(HO)C6H4CO2BiO (pepto-bismol, a drug for the traveler's diarrhea - can give you a black\ntongue). It was shown (together with sample 3) at IUCR XVIII, Glasgow, 1999 in a poster\ncomparing the merits and advantages of synchrotron versus conventional X-ray [11]. Its molecular\nformula appears quite simple (fig. 4).\n\nConclusion\nThe two months allocated for solving at least one of 3 structures by SDPD methodology would\nhave been quite enough if SDPD was routine (a rainy evening would have been sufficient). Only\ntwo final answers for samples 1 and 2 suggest that either SDPD experts are lazy or SDPD is still not\nroutine. This will be the main SDPDRR-2 conclusion. Anyway, three computer programs certainly\ndeserve special mention because they could provide exceptional results in due time : Index for\nindexing (participant 5) and FOX (participant 2) as well as TOPAS (participant 7) for structure\nsolution. The SDPDRR-2 seems to establish the triumph of direct space methods (FOX, TOPAS).\nBut statistics cannot seriously be deduced from two contributions (owing to the number of data\ndownloads, the return is less than 2%). Considering that still less than 100 SDPDs are published per\nyear, it was clearly utopian to expect that 3% of them could be solved in 2 months by people\nextremely busy at solving their own difficult problems. The final examination of the SDPD Internet\nCourse [12] is a complete SDPD, the subscribers having two weeks for the structure determination\nof a moderatly complex case. Some are able to finish the job in less time (4-5 days). Since\nsubscribers at the end of the course become experts, this may define the mean time needed for a\nsimple SDPD. That prohibiting time of several days may lead to a choice : either participants solve\ntheir own problems or they solve the round robin problems. Ordinary users could have preferred to\nsolve their own problems. But software developers have other motivations which are to promote\ntheir product, in principle, so that wasting days to solve the round robin problems may appear\nworthwhile to them. Is the absence of software like EXPO, DASH, POWDERSOLVE, PSSP, MRIA,\nFOCUS, SIMULATED ANNEALING, ENDEAVOUR, EAGER, OCTOPUS, SAFE (etc) indicative\nof failure to solve or of lack of willing to solve ? We do not have answers.\nFor those wanting to continue to play with the SDPDRR-2 data sets, they will remain available [3],\nin the hope that they will not definitely stay in a category \"which stubbornly refuse to yield to\nstructure solution\". Anyway, a doubling of the total number of SDPDs is expected again during the\nnext four years, this will have to correspond to a new revolution that would allow 200 structures to\nbe determined per year. A rendez-vous is given for the SDPDRR-3 in 2006, expecting for more\nsuccessful participants than just two or three out of over a hundred participants.\nReferences\n[1] http://www.cristal.org/SDPDRR/\n[2] http://www.iucr.org/iucr-top/comm/cpd/Newsletters/no25jul2001/cpd25.pdf\n[3] http://www.cristal.org/sdpdrr2/\n[4] CCP14 : http://www.ccp14.ac.uk/\n[5] P.W.
