This photometry, along with all images and a catalog of LMC variable stars,\nis now available for viewing or download from the MACHO Project websites,\nhttp://wwwmacho.anu.edu.au or http://wwwmacho.mcmaster.ca. The capabilities and organization of the new data retrieval facility is described in this paper.\n\n1.\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe MACHO Project (Alcock et al. 2000) had as its principal goal the detection of\ngravitational microlensing in the LMC, with the SMC and Galactic bulge as secondary\ntargets. The 1.3m Great Melbourne Telescope at Mt. Stromlo Observatory was used for\nthe observations, with a ccd mosaic camera containing 8 2k x 2k chips supplying images\nin two passbands simultaneously. Observations began in 1992, and terminated in 2000.\nApproximately 8TB of image data were collected, and photometric lightcurves constructed\nfor about 7.3 \u2217 107 stars.\nAll MACHO images and lightcurves, and a catalog of LMC periodic variable stars, are\nnow publicly available from the MACHO project website,\nhttp://wwwmacho.anu.edu.au/Data/MachoData.html or\nhttp://wwwmacho.mcmaster.ca/Data/MachoData.html. The MACHO data archive is housed\non a mass storage system at the ANU Supercomputer Facility. The storage hardware is a\nrobotic tape silo, fronted by a large disk cache. Access times vary from near zero if data is\ncached, to several minutes if data must be fetched from tape. Users should be aware that\n1\n\nSupercomputer Facility, Australian National University, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia\nEmail: robyn.allsman@anu.edu.au\n2\n\nResearch School of Astronomy and Astrophysics, Mount Stromlo Observatory, Cotter Road, Weston,\nACT 2611, Australia\nEmail: tsa@mso.anu.edu.au\n\n\f\u20132\u2013\nthe data they request will be delivered from the data archive in Australia regardless of which\nweb site they utilize.\nThe following sections of the paper briefly describe the data that is now available and\nthe nature of the web interface that is provided to it. More detailed information is available\nfrom the help sections provided on the website.\n\n2.\n\nImage Access\n\nImages can be selected in several ways. If only a representative image of a field is\nrequired, the best choice is probably the \"Template Image Download\" interface. Template\nimages form the base of Macho photometry and astrometry, and have been selected to\nhave good seeing and dark sky conditions. The \"Macho Image Search\" interface provides a\nflexible method of locating images of interest. Selection criteria can include position, date of\nobservation, seeing, airmass, and sky brightness. Finally, the \"Image Download\" interface is\nfor situations where the desired observation id's are already known.\n\n3.\n\nLightCurve Access\n\nThe Macho photometry data is internally organized as lightcurves. A lightcurve contains\nall available data in both passbands for a given star. At each time point several quantities\nare available in addition to the two instrumental magnitudes. These include the estimated\nerrors, flags that indicate possible problems with the particular data point, and information\nabout the observation that generated the data.\nAt present, the stars for which lightcurves are desired must be specified by their Macho\nfield.tile.sequence identifier. This allows easy access to lightcurves which have appeared in\npublished papers, but is not useful for searches, eg for objects near some particular position.\nAs discussed in the last section of this paper, an enhanced search capability will be provided\nshortly.\nOnce selected, lightcurves can either be viewed interactively, or downloaded to the user's\ncomputer. The interactive viewer provides capabilities to zoom in or out, and to access details\nof individual lightcurve points.\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\n4.\n\nVariable Star Catalog\n\nThe variable star catalog contains about 21000 stars from the LMC. These stars have\nbeen phased and classified, and the catalog contains a variety of quantities of interest. Stars\nmay be selected based on their catalog parameters, and phased or unphased lightcurves\ndisplayed. A paper presenting the variable star catalog is in preparation (Alcock et al.\n2001).\n\n5.\n\nFuture Enhancements\n\nA number of enhancements to the Macho data access site are planned for the near\nfuture:\n\u2022 RA/Dec selection of stars: The need to access lightcurves by field.tile.sequence will be\nremoved with a new interface that allows selection of stars based on RA/Dec coordinates.\n\u2022 GLU: A GLU interface will be provided, so that external websites, such as CDS, will\nbe able to easily incorporate Macho data.\n\u2022 Mirrors: We plan to set up mirror sites in North America for the data, which is\ncurrently available only from Australia.\n\u2022 Improved image format: Image data is currently returned as 16 separate FITS files,\none for each amplifier in the CCD mosaic. We are planning to bundle these into a\nsingle multi-extension FITS file, and include WCS data in the header which will allow\nany pixel in the image to be mapped to RA/Dec with sub-arcsecond precision.\n\nREFERENCES\nAlcock, C., et al. 2000, ApJ, 542, 281\nAlcock, C., et al. 2001, in preparation\n\nThis preprint was prepared with the AAS LATEX macros v5.0.\n\n\f"}
