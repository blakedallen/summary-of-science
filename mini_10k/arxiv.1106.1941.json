Including estimates of lattice zero-point energies,\nice is found to adopt three novel crystal phases. The underlying sub-lattice of O atoms remains\nsimilar among them, and the transitions can be characterized by reorganizations of the hydrogen\nbonds. The symmetric hydrogen bonds of ice X and P bcm are initially lost as ice transforms to\nstructures with symmetries P mc21 (800 \u2013 950 GPa) and P 21 (1.17 TPa), but they are eventually\nregained at 5.62 TPa in a layered structure C2/m. The P 21 \u2192 C2/m transformation also marks\nthe insulator-to-metal transition in ice, which occurs at a significantly higher pressure than recently\npredicted.\nPACS numbers: 64.70.K-, 62.50.-p, 71.30.+h, 96.15.Nd\n\n1\n\n\fThe behavior of H2 O at high pressures is of fundamental important for both condensed\nmatter and planetary physics [1, 2]. This can be attributed to its substantial abundance in\nthe universe, and the fact that a significant fraction of it exists in ice form at high pressures\nin planetary interiors. In our solar system alone, for example, Uranus and Neptune consist\nlargely of H2 O, ammonia, and methane ice mixtures up to 800 GPa, and the cores of Saturn\nand Jupiter likely contain ice components at pressures of approximately 800 GPa \u2013 1.8 TPa\nand 4 \u2013 5 TPa, respectively [3]. Despite this importance, very little is known about the\nbehavior of solid H2 O (ice) under such extreme conditions. The primary reasons for this are\nthat experiments have thus far only reached 210 GPa [4] and, until recently, theoretical and\ncomputational methods have not existed to reliably predict crystal structures with little or\nno a priori information.\nThe known phase diagram of H2 O is extremely rich. 15 thermodynamically stable phases\nof ice have been observed experimentally [5], ice XV only recently [6]. The highest pressure\nphase experimentally observed is ice X, which is obtained from a phase-transition from ice\nVII (or VIII, depending on the temperature) near 44 GPa [7]. In this phase, the O atoms\nform a body-centered cubic sub-lattice and the H atoms adopt symmetric positions between\nthem at pressures near 110 \u2013 120 GPa [8], and so this phase is also referred to as symmetric\nice. Because of this the distinction between covalent bonds and hydrogen bonds is lost, as\nis thus the molecular form of H2 O, resulting in an atomic solid. Recent lattice dynamical\ncalculations using density functional theory (DFT) suggest that the symmetric ordered form\nof ice X is only stable from 120 \u2013 400 GPa [9]. Near 300 \u2013 400 GPa a lattice instability\noccurs, resulting in a transition to a crystal phase with P bcm symmetry (Hermann\u2013Mauguin\nspace-group symbol) [9], as first predicted by Benoit et al. in 1996 via constant pressure\nmolecular dynamics simulations [10]. This phase results from a compromise between the\npacking efficiency of the O atoms and a preservation of the symmetric hydrogen bonds,\nresulting in a distorted hexagonal close-packed (hcp) sub-lattice of O atoms. At even higher\npressures, which is of fundamental importance to planetary physics, for example, very little\nis known. However, a number of intriguing possibilities have been proposed, perhaps the\nmost interesting being an insulator-to-metal transition [11, 12].\nIn this Letter, the recently proposed ab initio random structure searching (AIRSS)\nmethod of Pickard and Needs to predict crystal structures [13], combined with DFT, is\nused to determine the ground-state structures of ice at high pressures. In this method, a\n2\n\n\fnumber of random configurations are each relaxed to the ground state at constant pressure\n(see below). After enough trials, a good sampling of the configuration space is obtained and\nthe ground-state structure(s) can be identified. This method has been used to successfully\npredict the ground-state structures of a number of systems [14], most recently including\nthose of atomic metallic hydrogen [15].\nCalculations were performed using the Quantum ESPRESSO DFT code [16]. Normconserving Troullier\u2013Martins pseudopotentials [17] were used for all calculations. For O,\ncore radii of 1.25, 1.25, and 1.4 a.u. were used for the s, p, and d components, respectively.\nFor H, a core radius of 0.8 a.u. was used for the AIRSS and then decreased to 0.3 a.u. for\nrecalculating detailed enthalpy vs pressure curves. For all calculations, the Perdew-BurkeErnzerhof generalized-gradient approximation exchange and correlation functional [18] was\nused. See Ref. [19] for justifications for these approximations. A plane-wave basis set with\na cutoff of 120 Ry was used for the AIRSS and then increased to 350 Ry for recalculating\nenthalpy curves. For Brillouin-zone sampling, 83 k-points were used for all calculations,\nexcept for Cmcm, Cmca, P 42 /nnm, and P 21 /m (see below) for which 123 were used to\nrecalculate enthalpy curves. The high-accuracy cutoff and k-point sampling were found to\ngive a total convergence in energy to better than 1 mRy/H2 O and the total pressure to\napproximately 1 GPa for each structure. Phonons were calculated using density functional\nperturbation theory as implemented within Quantum ESPRESSO, and were converged to a\nsimilar level of accuracy as the DFT calculations.\nRandom structures were constructed by generating random unit-cell translation vectors,\nrenormalizing the volume, and choosing random H2 O configurations (positions and orientations). Constant pressure geometry relaxations were performed at 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, and 5\nTPa for unit cells containing 4 H2 O units, and then additional relaxations were performed\nat 1 and 2 TPa using unit cells containing 6 and 8 H2 O units. (However, the latter searches\nonly revealed a couple of additional structures \u2013 see below and Ref. [19].) It is important to\nrealize that searches over unit cells of their factors are implicitly included in these calculations \u2013 i.e., those with 1, 2, or 3 H2 O units. While structures with unit cells containing 5, 7,\nor more H2 O units are certainly possible, it is reasonable to suspect that they are unlikely\nbased on comparisons with the other predicted high-pressure phases of ice, such as P bcm\n[10] and the recently proposed Cmcm and P bca structures [12] (all found via simulations\ncapable of generating unit cells with up to 16 H2 O units). Typical relaxations included\n3\n\n\fFIG. 1: (color online). Enthalpies of the ground-state structures of ice relative to P bcm, not\nincluding lattice zero-point energies. Note that the enthalpies vs pressure are nearly linear from\n2.5 \u2013 5 TPa (not shown).\n\nup to 175 random structures at each pressure considered, which appeared to be enough to\ngenerate both the lowest-enthalpy structure and higher-enthalpy metastable ones multiple\ntimes.\nAs a confirmation of the validity of this method to reliably predict the high-pressure\nphases of ice, at 500 GPa 10% of the relaxations revealed P bcm as the lowest-enthalpy\nstructure. This is consistent with previous predictions [9, 10], indicating that AIRSS as\ndescribed above is indeed capable of generating (presumably correct) ground-state structures\nwith a high probability and that the searches are exhaustive, as well as supports the ice X\n\u2192 P bcm transformation.\nAfter performing the AIRSS, each structure within approximately 25 mRy/H2 O of the\nlowest-enthalpy one found was considered for further investigation. Detailed enthalpy vs\npressure curves were calculated for these structures by performing additional constantpressure geometry optimizations while keeping symmetries fixed; Fig. 1.\nNear 800 GPa, P bcm becomes unstable relative to two additional structures, P mc21\nand P bca. Such instability is expected, as it has been demonstrated that P bcm develops a\ndynamic instability near 760 GPa in the (1/2, 0, 0) phonon mode [12]. P bcm and P mc21\nare both shown in Fig. 2, and P bca is shown in Refs. [12, 19]. P mc21 and P bca are both\nsimilar to P bcm. For example, in the perspective of Fig. 2 the O atoms remain close to their\n\n4\n\n\fFIG. 2: (color online). Ground-state structures of ice at 1 TPa. (left) P bcm and (right) P mc21 .\n\ndistorted hcp sub-lattice positions [10]. However, the H atoms are shifted away from their\nsymmetric O\u2013H\u2013O positions. In P bca, a small distortion of the H atoms occurs in alternating\ndirections, leaving them close to tetrahedral sites and the hydrogen-bond network intact. In\nP mc21 , on the other hand, a reorganization of the hydrogen-bond network occurs. In the\nperspective of Fig. 2, every O atom in P bcm is connected to both its vertical and horizontal\nneighbors via symmetric hydrogen bonds. In P mc21 , this bonding is only retained in every\nother column of O atoms, but without symmetric hydrogen bonds. The other O atoms\nbecome disconnected from their vertical neighbors, and instead become hydrogen bonded\n(and not symmetrically) with O atoms out of the plane.\nIt should be noted that P bca was recently proposed as a likely candidate for the groundstate structure of ice from 760 GPa to 1.25 TPa [12]. However, Fig. 1 shows that it is only\ncompetitively stable with P mc21 from 800 \u2013 925 GPa. It is certainly possible that P bca is\na stable phase of ice in this narrow pressure range. However, given that it is only a slight\ndistortion of P bcm and less than 1 mRy/H2 O more stable, a more likely scenario is that it\nis a transitional structure that occurs during the P bcm \u2192 P mc21 transformation (this is\nfurther suggested by lattice dynamics calculations that show P bca is unstable near 800 GPa\n\u2013 see Ref. [19]). In any case, 800 GPa (approximately) marks a transition away from the\nsymmetric hydrogen bonds seen in ice X and P bcm, which are shown below to be regained\nat much higher pressures.\nP mc21 remains stable until 1.3 TPa. It then becomes relatively unstable towards a structure with P 21 symmetry, which is shown in Fig. 3. Comparison of Figs. 2 and 3(left) shows\nthat (in the plane of each figure) the O atoms continue to remain close to their distorted hcp\npositions. Into the plane, however, P 21 undergoes a noticeable compression and slight dis-\n\n5\n\n\fFIG. 3: (color online). P 21 at 1.4 TPa. (left) Same perspective as in Fig. 2.

The perspectives are similar to those shown in Fig. 3.\nNote that alternating O atoms are out of the plane relative to one another.\n\ntortion relative to P bcm (not shown). Moreover, it can be seen that a further reorganization\nof the hydrogen-bond network occurs. O atoms in every other column continues to remain\nconnected to their vertical neighbors, but the hydrogen bonds distort slightly outwards in\nalternating directions. The hydrogen bonds of the other O atoms, on the other hand, rearrange more significantly, and each O atom becomes connected to either one neighboring\ncolumn or the other, also in an alternating fashion.\nP 21 remains the lowest-enthalpy structure up to the highest pressure considered in this\nwork of 5 TPa. However, another competitive structure was also found in this pressure\nrange, C2/m. In fact, Fig. 1 shows that the relative enthalpy difference between C2/m and\nP 21 slowly decreases with increasing pressure. A linear extrapolation of the enthalpy vs\npressure curves near 5 TPa (which should be quite accurate) indicates a transition pressure\nof approximately 5.29 TPa. As can be seen in Fig. 4, C2/m is a layered structure, where\neach layer consists of two sets of O atoms. Additionally, a slight shear deformation of the\nlayers occurs, leaving the O atoms close to, but slightly displaced from their distorted hcp\npositions. (Note that a less stable structure without the shear deformation, C2/c, was also\n\n6\n\n\fFIG. 5: (color online). Metastable structures of ice at 2 TPa. (left) P -3m1 and (right) F ddd.\n\nfound \u2013 see Ref. [19].) Moreover, symmetric hydrogen bonds are seen to be regained, which\nconnect the O atoms within each layer.\nComparison of the O atoms in Fig. 3(right) with 4(left) indicates that a transition towards the layered C2/m structure is evident in P 21 (and in fact even P bcm, which looks\nsimilar but less compressed, as discussed above). Given these results, it is possible to understand the phase transformations that ice undergoes at high pressures. In all structures,\nthe O atoms remain close to their distorted hcp positions and compress along a preferred\naxis (e.g., into the plane of Fig. 2). This compression leads to structures without symmetric\nhydrogen bonds, P mc21 and P 21 , obtained via reorganizations of the hydrogen-bond network. Continued compression eventually results in a layered structure where the symmetric\nhydrogen bonds are regained.\nA number of structures with higher enthalpies were also generated during the AIRSS, as\nevident from Fig. 1. It has recently been demonstrated (at medium pressure) that such\nmetastable structures of ice are both experimentally realizable [20] and predictable via\nAIRSS [21]. It is thus quite possible that those shown in Fig. 1 may actually occur in\nnature, and therefore worthwhile to very briefly mention a couple of them here. Brief descriptions of the other ones can be found in Ref. [19]. Two of the most interesting metastable\nstructures found were P -3m1 and F ddd, as shown in Fig. 5. In both structures, the O atoms\nonce again remain near distorted hcp positions. However, their hydrogen bonds are quite\ndifferent. In P -3m1, for example, 2/3 of the O atoms have 3 strongly-coordinated H atoms\nand the other 1/3 have none, but 6 weakly-coordinated ones instead. F ddd, on the other\nhand, forms a string-like structure though its hydrogen bonds. (Note that below 1.6 TPa,\nF ddd distorts into a lower symmetric form, F dd2.)\nThe results presented above were for static lattices. However, the light hydrogen mass\n\n7\n\n\fcauses the phases of ice at high pressures to have large zero-point energies (ZPEs) that\nmust be estimated in order to determine the most stable ground-state structures. ZPEs\nwere neglected during the AIRSS, but their impacts were estimated afterwards using the\nR\nharmonic approximation: EZPE = d\u03c9 F (\u03c9)h\u0304\u03c9/2, where F (\u03c9) is the phonon density of\nstates. F (\u03c9) was calculated using a 23 grid of q-points in the Brillouin zone, which is\nestimated to be sufficient to converge ZPE differences between structures to within a few\npercent.\nReference [19] shows that the ZPEs are quite large, increasing from approximately 67\nmRy/H2 O at 400 GPa to 127 mRy/H2 O at 5 TPa. Despite such large values, ZPE differences\nbetween the structures are relatively small, in all cases within a few mRy/H2 O. While this\nenergy scale is not enough to change the ordering of the structures, it is enough to affect\nprecise transition pressures, in some cases. For example, P 21 is found to have a lower ZPE\nthan both P mc21 and C2/m, causing the corresponding transition pressures to be shifted\nto 1.17 and 5.62 TPa, respectively. The ZPE difference between P bcm and P mc21 , on\nthe other hand, is found to be practically negligible, resulting in a shift of the transition\npressure higher by less than 50 GPa. Note that these estimates neglect the impact of zeropoint pressure, which given the small differences in ZPE between the structures should be\nrelatively minor.\nOne of the most intriguing suggestions regarding high-pressure ice is its metallization\n[11]. Pursuant to this, the electronic density of states for each structure shown in Fig. 1\nwas investigated. Except for F ddd and Cmm2, all of the structures eventually become\nmetallic with increasing pressure. However, P mc21 was found to be insulating over its\nentire range of stability as was P 21 up to 4.7 TPa. Furthermore, given that DFT typically\nunderestimates band gaps, the actual insulator-to-metal transition in P 21 likely occurs at\na much higher pressure. Although, metallization in C2/m occurs at a pressure much lower\nthan the P 21 \u2192 C2/m transformation (in fact, it was found to be metallic at all pressures\nconsidered). It can therefore concluded that this phase transformation at 5.62 TPa also\nmarks the insulator-to-metal transition in ice, which is a significantly higher pressure than\nthe recent prediction of 1.55 TPa [12].\nIn conclusion, AIRSS was used to determine the ground-state and metastable structures\nof ice at high pressures. The predicted transformation sequence is ice X [7] \u2192 P bcm (300 \u2013\n400 GPa [10]) \u2192 P mc21 (800 \u2013 950 GPa) \u2192 P 21 (1.17 TPa) \u2192 C2/m (5.62 TPa), where\n8\n\n\ftransition pressures have been indicated in parenthesis. No additional competitive structures\nwere found during the AIRSS, even at 5 TPa. Thus, any phases existing beyond C2/m do\nso at much higher pressures, which are clearly outside of the range of experimental and\nmost astrophysical applications. The P 21 \u2192 C2/m transformation was demonstrated to\nmark the insulator-to-metal transition in ice, which is also beyond pressures found inside\neven many giant planets, such as Jupiter, and it can therefore be concluded that the ice\ncomponents in them remain insulating. Along with the recent work elucidating the highpressure high-temperature phase diagram of water [22], the results presented herein provide\na comprehensive picture of the high-pressure phase diagram of H2 O.\nJ.
