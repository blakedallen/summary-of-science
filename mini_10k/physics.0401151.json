They are the\nmathematical compilation of the experiments and considerations\nbased on the original work of Cavendish, Coulomb, Poisson,\nAmp\u00e8re, Faraday and others [1]. Mathematically they are partial\ndifferential equations. Different notations exist for them: most\npopular is the vector notation (O. Heaviside), which replaced the\noriginal notations in quaternions\n\n(J.C. Maxwell).\n\nMore modern\n\nis the tensor notation (H. Minkowski, A. Einstein), which is able\nto describe situations which are discussed in the theory of\nrelativity\n\n[2].\n\nAll\n\nnotations\n\nare\n\nequivalent\n\nin\n\nthe\n\nnon-\n\nrelativistic limit.\nThe Maxwell equations were and still are very successful. Until\ntoday their range of applicability grows permanently.\nHere a short derivation is given which especially takes account\nfor the newer developments of material descriptions. Furthermore,\nmonopoles are included because Ehrenhaft proved their existence\nalready 50 years ago [3-6]. It will be shown that the theory\nneeds\n\nalso\n\nproblems.\n\ntheir\n\nThis\n\nexistence\n\nexplains\n\nfor\n\nperhaps\n\na\n\nfull\n\neffects\n\ndescription\nwhich\n\nare\n\nof\n\nall\n\nregarded\n\ngenerally as dubious because they cannot be understood in a\nconventional approach.\n\n2\n\n\f2) The equations of the electromagnetic field\n\na) The laws of Coulomb and the equation of Poisson\nThe so called Coulomb law describes the force between electric\ncharges.

Especially, Biot&Savart and Amp\u00e8re tackled the\ntask to solve this problem by intelligent experiments [1, 11].\nIn order to fit their experiment by a theory they made additional\nassumptions which filled up some lacking observations. This led\nto different laws for the forces between differential current\nelements\n\nof\n\na\n\ncircuit.\n\nFor\n\nclosed\n\ncircuits,\n\nhowever,\n\nthe\n\ndifferent versions coincided in one law. The discussion of this\nproblem is running until today.\nBiot and Savart [12-14] found out that \"the total force which is\nexerted by a file of infinite lenght under current on an element\nof austral or boreal magnetism in the distance FA or FB, is\nperpendicular on the shortest distance between the molecule and\n\nfig.1a: the Biot-Savart - setup\nA magnetic needle is under the influence of the\nfield of current CZ .

The\nvortex field is caused by currents, the potential field by charges. If this\nis compared with theorem 2 in appendix 2, then the Biot-Savart law generates\na magnetic vortex field H of a current element. All other fields deviating\nfrom Biot-Savart, have to be written as\nfield law = Biot-Savart-law + additional terms\nThese additional terms must be identified as a potential field. If the\ncurrent is integrated over a closed circle the potential terms cancel to\n\na\n\nzero1 .\n\nIf one integrates over both interacting closed circuits the von\nNeumann force law is obtained [1, 8, 24, 25]\n\nF\n\nI1 I2\nc\n\n2\n\nll |xx | ds ds\n12\n\n3\n\n1\n\n2\n\n(24)\n\n12\n\nFrom (22) also follows, that the magnetic field can be calculated\nfrom a vector potential H :=\n\n/\u00d7A with\n\n1\n\nThe Biot-Savart law is probably the correct version for\nphysical currents. It does not generate \"magnetic charges\", it\ncoincides with the B-field of a moving charge[19] according to\nLienard-Wiechert(in the special case of zero acceleration) and\ntakes into account of the self-interaction of single current\nelements, see Cavallieri et al.[19].

The total magnetic field B includes the\nfield from the measurable currents j and the field M of the\nmagnetism of the material, where the field M (according to\nAmp\u00e8re) is generated exclusively by currents in the material.\nThen follows\nrot B\n\n4\u008c\n(j\n\bj\n)\nc conductor material\n\n(27)\n\nwith\nB: \u03bcH\n\nB: H\b4\u008cM\n\noder\n\n(28)\n\nAnalogously like for charges a relation is sought between the\nempirical variables.

Thus, no charges can built up and only dipol\nterms and terms of higher orders of a series expansion of B can\ncontribute to the field. Hence a definition (29) analogous to\n(17) can be used for the magnetization M of the material\n\n/\u00d7M : j material /c\n\n(29)\n\nThen, using (27),(28) and subtracting (29) Amp\u00e8re \u0301s laws are\n4\u008c\nj\nc conductor\n\nrotH\n\ndivB 0\n\n(30)\n\nIn order to derive the present version Amp\u00e8re \u0301s law is rewritten\nas [8]:\n\n/\u00d7H rot rotA grad divA /2A\n\nP\n\n/ j(x \u0301) /.\n\nWith\n\nthe\n\n/ \u0301 2 |x x \u0301|\n\n1\n\nc\n\n1\nd 3x \u0301\n|x x \u0301|\n\nmathematical\n\nP\n\nj(x \u0301)\nc\n\n/2\n\nrelations\n\n(31)\n\n1\nd 3x \u0301\n|x x \u0301|\n\n/ |x x \u0301|\n\n1\n\n/ \u0301|x x \u0301|\n\n1\n\nand\n\n4\u008c/(x x \u0301) this becomes\n\n/\u00d7H\n\nP\n\n/ j(x \u0301) ./ \u0301\nc\n\n1\n4\u008c\nd 3x \u0301 \b j\n|x x \u0301|\nc\n\nbecause A also fulfills the Poisson equation\n\n(32)\n\n/2 A\n\n4\u008c j/c .\n\nIf the integral in (32) is integrated partially using that j\nvanishes at boundary in the infinite, then follows\n\n/\u00d7H 4\u008c j / / \u0301 j(x \u0301) d 3x \u0301\nc\n\nc|x x \u0301|\n\n15\n\n(33)\n\n\fNow, the observation is used that no charges build up during\nmagnetostatic experiments.

This expression is known as the\nCoulomb-gauge. The vector potential A is not a unique function,\nbecause replacing A by A*= A + /f(x) fulfills the gauge as well.\nAs we will see later it is necessary for the choice of the vector\npotential A that a physically motivated constraint has to be\nfulfilled for grad div A=? - i.e. the continuity equation [26].\nAt the time of Biot&Savart and Amp\u00e8re this was not known fully\nand only the closed circuits could be tested out. So the result\n(22) for the H-Feld was ok. . However later, after the discovery\nof the electron by J.J. Thomson [27], discussions came up due to\nthe basic problem behind the approaches of Biot&Savart and\nAmp\u00e8re: Not every magnetic problem could be discussed by a closed\nelectric circuit. Freely moving charges (as differential current\nelements) could exist and the question for their field had to be\nsolved. So observations were published that longitudinal forces\nexisted in railguns [28, 29] and in plasma tubes [30, 31]\nalso\n\nthe\n\nreview\n\narticle\n\n[32]).\n\nThese\n\nforces\n\nseemed\n\n(See\nto\n\nbe\n\nexplained by Amp\u00e8re's differential force law, but not by Biot-\n\n16\n\n\fSavart \u0301s version. Althought these problems seem to be solved\ntoday not in favour for longitunal forces2 the problem will be\nleft open here for further considerations. So all mathematically\npossible field configurations will be included in the discussion\nby adding a magnetic potential to the magnetic vector field.\nMathematically any vector field F can be decomposed into two\nterms FC and FV, derived from a potential (for FC) and from a\nvector potential of a vortex field (for FV), see the proof in\nappendix 2 [26] and [35, 36]. So any H-Feld can be described by\n1\nc\n\nH HV \b HC\n\nHere\n\n,j(x \u0301) \u00d7 |xx x \u0301|x \u0301 d x ,N (x \u0301) |xx x \u0301|x \u0301 d x\n3\n\n3\n\nH\n\n3\n\n(35)\n\n3\n\nNH is the magnetic charge distribution due to the deviation\n\nfrom Biot-Savart \u0301s differential law, see eq.(18).\nIf a concrete system is solved with a boundary problem, a Laplace\nfield HL has to be added which fulfills rot HL =0 and div HL =0.\nH H V \b HC \b HL\n\n1\nc\n\n,j(x \u0301) \u00d7 |xx x \u0301|x \u0301 d x ,N (x \u0301) |xx x \u0301|x \u0301 d x\n\nHere is the Laplace field HL :\n\n3\n\n3\n\n3\n\nH\n\n3\n\n/3(x)\n\n(36)\n\n/3(x) .

So every field configuration can be described generally.\nIt will be shown here that this is useful for problems with\ninduced and permanent magnetization. Only a slight change in the\nconventional interpretation of the meaning of the magnetic field\nB leads to a Poisson equation for magnetic charges.\nProof:\nThe conventional theory assumes for problems with permanent magnetization [8]\n(without exciting field from outside), that\n\n/.B0 /.(H0 \b 4\u008cM) 0\n\n(38)\n\nHere is M the magnetization of the material and H0 the inner magnetic field\nwhich generates the magnetization. If a field is applied additionally from\noutside, this equation is enlarged\n\n/.B0 /.(H0 \b H \b 4\u008cM) 0\n\n(39)\n\nwith H a the exciting magnetic field from outside, which is added. Because\nno currents are obvious in matter as cause for the inner H0-field it holds /\u00d7H 0\n0\n. This means that H0 can be derived from a potential\n\nH0\n\n\u0004H\n\naccording to\n0\n\n/\u0004H and the magnetostatic Poisson-equation follows [8]\n0\n\n18\n\n\f\u008c\u0004H\n\n\u008c!M\n\nwith /.H0 : 4\n\n4\u008c!M\n\n0\n\n(40)\n\ndefined as \"effective magnetic charge density\" in\n\n[8].\n\nOur new definition of B is introduced here as follows\n\n/.B : /.(H \b 4\u008cM)\n\n4\u008c!M : 4\u008c!H\n\n(41)\n\nThis redefinition takes into account (39) and (40) and uses the redefinition\n\n!H:=-!M . So the conventional equation (39) can be written down with magnetic\ncharges in a form completely analogous to electrostatics. Analogously to\nelectrostatics, the empirical field is now the H-field contrary to the\nconventional interpretation which takes the B-field. q.e.d.\n\nThus,\n\nmagnetostatic\n\nboundary\n\nproblems\n\ncan\n\nbe\n\na\n\nworked\n\nout\n\nanalogously to electrostatics with adapted boundary conditions.\nTextbooks show [8], that the solution of problems with induced\nmagnetic polarization are completely identical to electrostatics.\nFor the simple phenomena of induced polarization the outer\n\nfig.3: polarized bowl in a potential field\nboundary condition between inner and the outside of bowl:no charges and no currents, i.e. Binner =\nBoutside determines the charge distribution at the outer boundary of the bowl similar like in electrostatics. In the volumes holds the Laplace equation \u00fb3 =/B=0. For the equations of a metal bowl in\nthe electric field the magnetic variables have to be replaced by electric ones analogously.\n\n19\n\n\fboundary conditions represent either given current distributions\nof\n\na coil exciting the material, either they represent\n\nan\n\narbitrary field given on a chosen boundary. Then, the origin of\nthis field at the boundary has to be thought in a distance far\nfrom the object under consideration.\nIn or outside of the neighborhood of the induced magnetized body,\nhowever, the magnetic field of the material fulfills locally\nalways \u00fb3 /.B 0 and /\u00d7H 0 . Here the Laplace equation holds for\nthe induced magnetism and no charges exist ( \u00fb3 =/B=/D=0).\nIf the Laplace equation is not fulfilled then the existence of\nmagnetic charges is probable. This can be the case for problems\nwith permanent magnets. In this case the magnets are described\nby magnetic charges in their volume. The situation is still more\ncomplicated for the ferromagnetic hysteresis of iron. If compared\nwith the conventional parity tabel, see tab.2, the B-field has\n(-1)\n\nparity\n\nunder\n\ntime\n\ninversion,\n\ni.e.\n\nif\n\nthe\n\ncurrent\n\nis\n\ninversed, the field has to be inversed as well. If a hysteresis\nexists, this is not the case, because the hysteresis line B(H)\nis not unique. For a change of parity with fields lower than the\nstrenght of the coercitivity, the change in parity can easily be\ndisproved. In this case inhomogenities or gradients of magnetic\npermeability \u03bc(x) can induce magnetic charges. Then it holds\n\n/.B(x) /.(\u03bc(x).H(x)) \u03bc(x)/.H(x) \b H(x)./\u03bc(x) 4\u008cNM g 0\n\n20\n\n(42)\n\n\ffig.4: field lines of magnetic H-field of a cylindric permanent magnet\nthe magnet is modelled here as capacity of magnetic charges.The magnetic charges are\ndistributed on the surfaces of north and south pole.

So, the\npresence of permanent magnetic poten-tial destroys the parity of\na current-generated constant B-field similarly like it does the\nbehaviour of the beta-decay in a field .\nHence, a general B-field with no parity cannot be explained\nsolely by a vector potential A,\n1) because B = rot A has always a defined parity;\n2) because B:=rot A implies div rot A = div B = 0, which is\ncontradicting to the physical result div Bg0.\nSo, the magnetic potential\n\n\u0004 has to be introduced for magnetic\n\ncharges. Similarly like the magnetic vector potential A it has\na more formal character, because it is not known very much about\nmagnetic charges except of Ehrenhaft \u0301s [5, 6] and Mikhailov \u0301s\nexperiments [37-48].

The second equation of (94) is the Nernst-\n\nPlanck equation, which should coincide with the second equation\n(93) for j=0. So electrochemical problems are discussed, cf.[63].\n5) In semiconductors the charge densities depend from chemical\npotential or quasi-Fermi level, which can be influenced by the\nelectric potential. A good example for such a system is a InAsquantum dot-doted FET invented by Yusa&Sakaki [64]. Its structure\nis shown in fig.7. The FET can be used for storing data by\ncharging the gate capacitance.\nThe theoretical model of this FET stems from Rack et al.[65].\nThe PDE \u0301s of the system is:\n\n40\n\n\ffig.7: structure of a InAs-quantum dot-doted GaAs-FET\na two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) is located in the boundary between AlGaAs and GaAs.

Figs.8 show the electron density\nin the 2DEG versus voltage. Remarkable is the orientation of the\nelectric cycle which is opposite to the ferroelectric loss\nhysteresis. This suggests a \"gain hysteresis\".\nIt is known that electric work can be changed to mechanic work\nwith efficiencies until 100% in the best electromotors. So\nelectric work should be equivalent to mechanical work in a\nthermodynamical sense. An \"isothermically\" proceeded\n\n41\n\nelectric\n\n\ffig.8a the experiment of Yusa-Sakaki- cf.

Thus, the FET is a\ncandidate\n\nfor\n\nsecond\n\nlaw\n\nviolation\n\nbecause\n\nonly\n\nheat\n\nand\n\nelectricity can be exchanged. According to own recent work [62]\nsuch cycles could be possible and further evidence can be found:\nCooling effects in semiconductors have been predicted by\n\n[66].\n\nThese considerations support the considerations for the FET\ndiscussed above. According to [66] the FET is cooled down if it\nis set under voltage. So the electrons are enforced into the\nquantum dots below the quasi-Fermi niveau, which leads to a\ncooling down because the state\n\nspace for the electrons is\n\nenlarged adiabatically .\nThe whole cycle is completed as follows: The electrons remain\nsticking at the quantum dots due to their binding energy, even\n42\n\n\fafter the discharge of the FET. Then, the FET goes back to the\nequilibrium\n\neither\n\nif\n\nthe\n\nvoltage\n\nis\n\nslightly\n\ninverted,\n\ncf.fig.8a, either if the wavelength of the thermal radiation is\nsuffiently high to overcome the binding energy of 0.25eV, which\nholds the electrons in the quantum dot potentials. So, the system\ncan be regarded also as a concretisation of Maxwell \u0301s demon. The\nelectric energy is lended probably from the quantum dots to be\npaid back after some time from the thermic influx of environment.\nFurther evidence for this idea can be found from the results of\nfig. 9a-c, which show the conduction band edge (which is here\nequivalent to the potential) in the FET at the beginning of the\ncycle, after charging it with voltage, and after discharging the\ncapacitance. From the slope in the diagrams one calculates the\nelectric\n\nfields\n\ncapacitance\n\nand\n\nin\n\nthe\n\napplies\n\nFET.\n\nIf\n\n(69)\n\none\n\none\n\nregards\n\ncan\n\nthe\n\nestimate\n\nFET\nthe\n\nas\n\na\n\nenergy\n\nexchanged after a cycle.

The effect is due to the nonlinear behaviour of the FET.\nOf course, all evidence of the experiment with the Yusa-Sakaki\nFET is indirectly concluded here. More decisive would be a full\nbalance of all electrons in the calculation or the experiment.\nHerewith, constitutive equations are characterized from the\nsimple case to the most complicated systems. Generally, the\ndescription of a system may be very sophisticated. However,\nnormally the description is made as simple as possible.\n\n3. Conclusions\nIt has been shown that the existence of magnetic charges is\njustified at least as a mathematical tool especially if fields\nof permanent magnetism have to be described.\n\nPhysically these\n\nresults suggest the following consequences to be proved:\nIf magnetic charges can be separated in space - for instance by\nthe form of the distribution of polarisation in a permanent\nmagnet - and if this magnet moves in a circle, two opposite\nmagnetic currents are generated which itself should generate an\nelectric field according to Faraday \u0301s law extended for magnetic\ncharge currents. Measurement of the electric field from moving\npermanent magnets can answer the question whether the electric\nfield stems from changing magnetic fields or from moving magnetic\ncharges. Both possibilities are calculable.\n\n45\n\n\fThe setup of such experiments would be similar to constructions\nfrom the unofficial subscene of physics. J. Searl [67-70], D.\nHamel [71] and Godin&Roschin [72, 73] claim to have observed\nstrong electrostatic effects around moving permanent magnets.\nFig.10 shows the calculated electrical vortex field\nmoving\n\npermanent\n\nmagnet\n\nring\n\nrepresenting\n\ntwo\n\n+ due to a\n\ncurrents\n\nof\n\nopposite magnetic surface charge which are placed on top and\nbottom of the ring, cf. fig.4.

Then,\n\nthe E-field is calculated according to E = rot\n\n+, fig. 11 a)+b).\n\nSo it has been estimated that the field has a maximum of 80 kV/cm\nnear the edges at the surface of the moving magnet. The order of\nmagnitude seems to coincide with the observations of Godin &\nRoschin [72, 73]. They observed a luminescence and therefore a\ncurrents in the ionized air near the surface of moving magnets.\nAccording to the usual representation of electrodynamics these\ncurrents have to brake down the rotation because any current\ngenerated by the induced E-field is directed against the original\nB-field due to the Lenz-rule. The authors above, however, report\na destabilizing self-acceleration and a weight change at higher\nangular velocities perhaps due the Brown-Biefeld effect [68]. We\nmention here that such a self-acceleration could be described by\na consistent modification of the theory where all\n\n!H are exchanged\n\nby -!H in all potential and field expressions. Another possibility\nare magnetic cycles of the nonlinear magnetic materials.\n\n57\n\n\fBibliography:\n\n1.\n2.\n3.\n\n4.\n\n5.\n6.\n\n7.\n8.\n9.\n10.\n11.\n12.\n13.\n14.\n15.\n16.\n17.\n18.\n19.\n20.\n21.\n22.\n23.\n\nWhittaker, E., A History of the Theories of Aether and Electricity - The Classical\nTheories.
