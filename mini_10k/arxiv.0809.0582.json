The computation depends on the nature of the neutrinos, however, we\nfirst discuss the consequences of the neutrino-photon interaction with characteristic electromagnetic properties\nof Majorana neutrinos: the transition dipole moments\n[2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. These minuscule transition dipole moments\nare sensitive probes of fluctuations at scales as small as\n10\u221235 cm [7], as seen through electromagnetic interactions at long range. This can also shed more light on the\nexpansion of the universe and the cosmological constant\nproblem [1].\nThe transition matrix elements relevant for \u03bdi \u2212\u2192\n\u03bdj ; i 6= j in neutrino mass extended standard model\nfor Majorana neutrinos are given in [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. The\nphoton-neutrino effective vertex is basicaly determined\nfrom the \u03bdi \u2212\u2192 \u03bdj \u03b3 transition, which is generated\nthrough electroweak processes that arise from one-loop\ndiagrams via the exchange of l = e, \u03bc, \u03c4 leptons and weak\nbosons, and is given by\nJ\u03bceff \u01eb\u03bc (q) =\n\n\b\n\nF1 (q 2 )\u03bd\u0304j (p\u2032 )L (\u03b3\u03bc q 2 \u2212 q\u03bc 6 q) \u03bdi (p)L\n\u0002\n\u2212 iF2 (q 2 ) m\u03bdj \u03bd\u0304j (p\u2032 )R \u03c3\u03bc\u03bd q \u03bd \u03bdi (p)L\n(1)\n+ m\u03bdi \u03bd\u0304j (p\u2032 )L \u03c3\u03bc\u03bd q \u03bd \u03bdi (p)R ]} \u01eb\u03bc (q).\n\nThe above effective interaction is invariant under electromagnetic gauge transformations. The first term in (1)\nvanishes for real photon due to the electromagnetic gauge\ncondition.\nThe general decomposition of the F2 term of the transition matrix element T [A, B] obtained from (1), leads to\nthe well known expression for the electric and magnetic\ndipole moments\ndel\nji =\n\n\u0001X \u2020\nm2lk\n\u2212e\n\u2212\nm\nm\n),\nU\nU\nF\n(\n\u03bd\n\u03bd\n2\nj\ni\nki\njk\nM \u22172\nm2W\nk=e,\u03bc,\u03c4\n\n(2)\n\n\u03bcji =\n\n\u0001X \u2020\nm2\n\u2212e\nm\u03bdi + m\u03bdj\nUjk Uki F2 ( 2lk ),\n\u22172\nM\nmW\n\n(3)\n\nk=e,\u03bc,\u03c4\n\nwhere i, j = 1, 2, 3 denotes neutrino species, and\nF2 (\n\nm2lk\n3 3 m2lk\n)\n\u2243\n\u2212\n+\n,\nm2W\n2 4 m2W\n\nm2lk\n\u226a 1,\nm2W\n\n(4)\n\nwas obtained after the loop integration.

In the case of offdiagonal transition moments, the first term in (4) vanishes in the summation over leptons due to the orthogonality condition of the neutrino mixing matrix U [8] (GIM\ncancellation).\nThe mixing matrix U is governing the decomposition of\na coherently produced left-handed neutrino \u03bdeL,l associated with charged-lepton-flavor l = e, \u03bc, \u03c4 into the mass\neigenstates \u03bdL,i :\nX\nUli |\u03bdL,i ; ~p, mi i,\n(5)\n|e\n\u03bdL,l ; p~ i =\ni\n\nThe characterizing feature of Majorana neutrinos (i.e.\n4-component notation the Hermitian, neutrino-flavor antisymmetric, electric and magnetic dipole operators), i.e.\nfields that do not distinguish particle from anti-particle\n(\u03c8i = \u03c8ic ), producing a transition matrix element T[A, B]\nwhich is a complex antisymmetric quantity in leptonflavor space:\nTji = \u2212i\u01eb\u03bc \u03bd\u0304j [(Aji \u2212 Aij ) \u2212 (Bji \u2212 Bij )\u03b35 ] \u03c3\u03bc\u03bd q \u03bd \u03bdi\n= \u2212i\u01eb\u03bc \u03bd\u0304j [2i IAji \u2212 2RBji \u03b35 ] \u03c3\u03bc\u03bd q \u03bd \u03bdi ,\n(6)\ni.e. antisymmetric with respect to neutrino mass eigenstates. From this equation it is explicitly clear that for\ni = j, del\n\u03bdi = \u03bc\u03bdi = 0. Also, considering transition moments, only one of two terms in (6) is non-vanishing if\nthe interaction respects CP invariance: The first term\nvanishes if the relative CP of \u03bdi and \u03bdj is even, and the\n\n\f2\nsecond term vanishes if it is odd [5]. Dipole moments\ndescribing the transition from Majorana neutrino mass\neigenstate-flavor \u03bdj to \u03bdi in the mass extended standard\nmodel are:\ndel\n\u03bdj \u03bdi =\n\n\u0001 X m2lk\n3ie\nR(U\u2020jk Uki ), (7)\n\u2212\nm\nm\n\u03bd\n\u03bd\nj\ni\n2M \u22172\nm2W\nk=e,\u03bc,\u03c4\n\n\u03bc\u03bdj \u03bdi =\n\n3ie\nm\u03bdi + m\u03bdj\n2M \u22172\n\n\u0001X\n\nk=e,\u03bc,\u03c4\n\nm2lk\nI(U\u2020jk Uki ) , (8)\nm2W\n\nwhere the neutrino-flavor mixing matrix U is approximatively unitary, i.e it is necessarily of the following form\n[7]\n3\nX\ni=1\n\nU\u2020jk Uki = \u03b4ji \u2212 \u03b5ji ,\n\n(9)\n\nwhere \u03b5 is a hermitian nonnegative matrix (i.e. with all\neigenvalues nonnegative) and\n\u221a\n|\u03b5| = Tr \u03b52 = O (m\u03bdlight /m\u03bdheavy ) \u223c 10\u221222 to 10\u221221 .\n\n(10)\n\nIt is important to note that the first term \u03b4ji from (9) in\nour case does not contribute, and that the case |\u03b5| = 0 is\nexcluded by the very existence of oscillation effects.\nThe transition dipole moments in general receive very\nsmall contributions because of the smallness of the neutrino mass, |m\u03bd | \u2243 10\u22122 eV [9]. The largest contribution\namong them is proportional to R and I parts of U\u20203\u03c4 U\u03c4 2 ,\nwhich corresponds to the 2 \u2192 3 transition. For the sum\nand difference of neutrino masses we assume hierarchical\nstructure and take |m3 +m2 | \u2243 |m3 \u2212m2 | \u2243 |\u2206m232 |1/2 =\n0.05 eV [9]. For the mixing matrix elements [8] we set\n|R(U\u20203\u03c4 U\u03c4 2 )| \u2243 |I(U\u20203\u03c4 U\u03c4 2 )| \u2264 0.5.\nThe electric and magnetic transition dipole moments\n\u0001\nel\nof neutrinos del\n\u03bd2 \u03bd3 and \u03bc\u03bd2 \u03bd3 are then denoted as dmag 23\nand are given by\ndel\nmag\n\n\u0001\n\n23\n\n=\n<\n\n3e m2\u03c4\n2M \u22172 m2W\n\n\u0012\n\u0013\nq\n|R(U\u20203\u03c4 U\u03c4 2 )|\n,\n|\u2206m232 |\n|I(U\u20203\u03c4 U\u03c4 2 )|\n\n\u223c 2.03 \u00d7 10\u221230 [e/eV] = 0.38 \u00d7 10\u221234 [e cm],\n= 2.07 \u00d7 10\u221224 \u03bcB .\n(11)\nNote that neutrino mass extended standard model, as\na consequence of loops (4), produces four orders of magnitude higher moments for a Dirac neutrino versus Majorana neutrino (11), due to an (m2l /m2W )-suppression of\nMajorana moments relative to the Dirac ones [10].\nAlso note that electric transition dipole moments of\nlight neutrinos are smaller than the ones of the d-quark.\nThis is the order of magnitude of light neutrino transition dipole moments underlying the see\u2013saw mechanism\n[11]. It is by orders of magnitude smaller than in lepton\n\nflavor unprotected SUSY models. See properties of neutrinos with respect to models which contain flavor mixing, the mass spectrum, dipole moments, electroweak radius, ect. including additional contributions arising from\nSUSY GUT's, extra dimensions, non-commutativity of\nspace-time, etc., in [2, 12] and refs quoted therein. Of\ncourse rigorously established experimental bounds on the\ndipole moments of neutrinos are by orders of magnitude\nweaker than implied by our hypotheses (11). The properties of astrophysical neutrinos can be found in the following references [2, 13].\nUp to this point our presentation is fully relativistic\nbut valid only for not too large momenta as appropriate\nfor the long range approximation adopted.\nThe non-relativistic components of electric and magnetic fields, whose coefficients are our electric and magnetic dipole moments, are\n~ 0 ) = 1 dk \u2202k \u2202j 1 ,\n(12)\nEj (d|\n4\u03c0\nr\n1\n1\nBj (~\u03bc|0 ) =\n\u03bck [\u2202k \u2202j \u2212 \u03b4kj \u2206] ,\n(13)\n4\u03c0\nr\n~ at position \"0\" determined with position\nFor dipole \"d\"\nvector ~x0 we have the following fields at point ~x:\n\u0010\n\u0011\n~ \u2212 d~ 1 \u2212 1 d\u03b4\n~ 3 (~x \u2212 ~x0 ) , (14)\n~ 0 ) = 1 3~e(~ed)\n~ d|\nE(\n4\u03c0\nr3\n3\n\u0010\n\u00111\n2\n~ \u03bc|0 ) = 1 3~e(~e\u03bc\n~ ) \u2212 ~\u03bc 3 + ~\u03bc\u03b4 3 (~x \u2212 ~x0 ) .

To estimate the dark energy density due to \u03bd-dipole potentials,\n\u03c1\u03bdDED , we first find the absolute value of the caracteristic\nenergy due to dipole-dipole interaction < \u01eb\u03bd >vac :\nR\nN\u03bd\n| d3 r V |\n1 2 X\n< \u01eb\u03bd >vac \u2243\n\u03bci \u03bc\n~\n~ j , (20)\n=\nv\nv 3 i,j=1\nwhere v is an intrinsic volume and N\u03bd is number neutrino\npairs. Next we define |\u03bc|2 as caracteristic measure of\nquadratic dipole strenght:\n|\u03bc|2 =\n\nN\u03bd\n2 X\n\u03bci \u03bc\n~\n~j ,\n3 i,j=1\n\n(21)\n\nand then the dark energy density due to \u03bd-dipoles is\n\u0010 |\u03bc| \u00112\n< \u01eb\u03bd >vac\n.\n(22)\n=\n\u03c1\u03bdDED =\nv\nv\nThis is maximal for the case for \u03bc \u00d7 \u03bc\u2032 = \u03bc21 \u00d7 \u03bc12 =\n\u2212(\u03bc12 )2 = |\u03bc12 |2 \u2243 |\u03bc|2 , etc. Namely in the two neutrino\nchannel (both spins, i.e. \u03bd and/or \u03bd\u0304) the dipole-dipole interactions do not change the total energy \u223c m1 + m2 ,\nprovided that the pair is composed of two different massflavors, i.e. 1 6= 2 (in the s-channel). Antisymmetric type of interactions just changes the flavor ordering\n\u03bd1,m1 \u03bd2,m2 \u2192 \u03bd2,m2 \u03bd1,m1 , (i.e. m1 \u2190\u2192 m2 at fixed\n1, 2). This gives the overall contribution, for dij \u2192 d12\nwith ij mass-eigenstate-flavors, which is, for example,\nd \u00d7 d\u2032 = d21 \u00d7 d12 = \u2212(d12 )2 = |d12 |2 because of the\nfactor i2 coming from \u2212(d12 )2 . Thus the attraction or\nrepulsion is within one mass-pair-channel and thus fully\nactive without changing the mass of the pair provided of\ncourse the mass-flavors in the pair are distinct.\nIn this way identifing, by hypotesis, (22) with the measured dark energy density today \u03c1DED we have found:\n\u0010 |\u03bc|2 \u00111/2\n4\u03c0 3\nv =\nR ,\n=\n\u03c1DED\n3 \u03bd\n\u0010 9 |\u03bc|2 \u00111/6\nR\u03bd =\n,\n(23)\n16\u03c0 2 \u03c1DED\n\nwhere R\u03bd is linear size of intrinsic volume v.\nIf we choose for |\u03bc| the value of the dipole moments\nin Eq. (11) and from observation \u03c1DED = (2.3 meV)4 \u00d7\nh2\n0.5 , with h = 0.73 being present day normalized Hubble\nconstant [14] we obtain:\nR\u03bd = 0.84 \u00d7 10\u221213 cm \u2243 (200 MeV)\u22121 .\n\n(24)\n\nNote that R\u03bd\u22121 \u2243 200 MeV relates intrinsic volume v to\na cosmological period corresponding to T \u223c R\u03bd\u22121 which\nrepresents a distant past of cosmological evolution.\nFrom (19) and (24) it follows R\u03bd \u226a R which is consistent with the dipole moment interaction dominating\ngravitational ones.\nThe elementary 4-neutrino interaction energy density is obviously very small, but it has a collective\n(number of neutrinos)2 growth. In addition it definitely will have, for arbitrary moments otherwise, an attractive sub-channel, depending on neutrino spins. The\nattraction will generate condensation phenomena, i.e.\nneutrino-condensates, by the Fermi-criterion, and since\ngravity is always attractive those two facts together lead\nto neutrino condensation phenomena relative to a free\nfermion gas.\nHere we only consider condensates giving rise to a\ncosmological term or equivalently to vacuum energydensity. Assuming nonvanishing neutrino condensates\ndue to dipole and gravitational long range interactions\ngiving rise to a cosmological term, (and/or to vacuum\nenergy density and pressure), i.e. not canceled by a readjustment of gravitational effects, it follows that these condensates are a specific source of dark energy. The condensate will correspond eventually to some 'vacuum-energy\ndensity' and may not be canceled as all other larger condensates, e.g. of QCD, electroweak [15], etc.\nThe condensate will then alter the neutrino energymomentum dependence as compared with free massive\nneutrino motion and thus the mean energy density in\nneutrinos will be larger for a given thermal ensemble\nand the same temperature. This temperature is approximately 2\u25e6 K today in 'the universe' and it corresponds to\n\u03bd-number density n\u03bd0 , i.e. n\u03bd0 \u2243 300 free neutrinos per\ncm3 at present.\nFrom known cosmological parameters we have dark\nenergy density today, while energy density of free light\nneutrinos (above vacuum), at temperature 2\u25e6 K and assuming neutrino mean mass m\u03bd \u2243 20 meV, is \u03c1ED =\n(0.4634 meV)4 . Ratio of those two facts\n(dark energy density)\n,\n(\u03bd \u2212 number density) \u00d7 (\u03bd \u2212 mean mass)\nproduces an interesting experimental number:\n2.3369 4\n\u03c1DED\n=(\n) = 5.0434 \u2243 647.\n\u03c1ED\n0.4634\n\n(25)\n\n\f4\nNeutrino mean mass of 20 meV was used due to the assumption of normal neutrino family hierarchy. Of course\nthis number is larger in the case of inverted hierarchy.\nIf our analysis can overcome the factor 647 and furthermore, since we are comparing two very different types of\nenergy densities, this could be transfered to neutrino condensates.\nThe experimental ratio in Eq. (25) has no direct bearing on the size of the neutrino condensates, which represent vacuum energy density. It is used only here in order\nto emphasize that we cannot exclude the possibility that\nthe sum of neutrino condensates equals the observed dark\nenergy density \u03c1DED in value (2.34 meV)4 and sign (positive), causing acceleration of the universe expansion today (and tomorrow) and beeing de Sitter-like. Our entire\napproach also ilustrates the sign of dark energy density\nwhich is inconsistent with stability in the framework of\nlocal field theory in uncurved space-time.\nThis could be related to another inconsistency arising\nfrom large, but finite, lifetimes of not only light neutrions\nand 'baryons'. Our estimate of unstable neutrino lifetime\nfrom the decay rate in the neutrino-mass extended standard model (SM)\n\u00112\nm5\u03bdh \u0010 GF e\n\u2020\n\u221a\nU\nU\nF\n2\n16\u03c0\n2 4\u03c0 2\n\u221263\n\u2243 1.6 \u00d7 10\nmeV ,\n\n\u0393(\u03bdh \u2192 \u03bdl \u03b3) =\n\n(26)\n\ngives\n\u03c4\u03bdh \u2243 4 \u00d7 1051 s .\n\n(27)\n\nThis value was obtained from \u03bd-dipole moment interaction (1)-(11) with neutrino mass: m\u03bdh = 50 meV.\nIt is interesting to notice that due to the sign of (2022), the total energy density, \u03c1, of relic neutrinos,\n\u03c1 = m\u03bd n \u03bd \u2212\n\n\u03c1\u03bdDED (=\n\nn2\u03bd |\u03bc|2 ) ,\n\n(28)\n\nmay have an extremum during the cosmological evolution. Namely n\u03bd = n\u03bd0 a\u22123 , with a being the scale factor\nof the universe. This, in turn, may entail consequences\nfor an accelerating phase of the expansion of the universe,\nsince near extremum aext , the EOS for relic neutrino gas,\nw\u03bd + 1 = \u2212\n\n1\n\u2202\n1 a d\u03c1\n(log \u03c1) = \u2212\n,\n3 \u2202(log a)\n3 \u03c1 da\n\n(29)\n\nswitches to \u2248 \u22121 . Indeed, from (28) we find\naext =\n\n2n\u03bd0 |\u03bc|2 \u00011/3\n.\nm\u03bd\n\n(30)\n\nIf we are to explore effects for a late-time accelerating\nphase, then we should set aext \u223c 1. However, even\nfor magnetic moments as large as 10\u221210 \u03bcB , the neutrino\nmass would be hopelessly tiny to induce any observable\neffect on present acceleration of the universe.\n\nAs a way out of the above inconsistency one can recall\na recent model proposed by Fardon, Nelson and Weiner\n(FNW) [16] and developed later by Kaplan, Nelson and\nWeiner [17], and Peccei [18], in which relic neutrinos are\ntied together with the sector of 'standard' dark energy\n(represented by a canonically normalized scalar field).\nThe model is very appealing with regard to the 'cosmic\ncoincidence problem' [19], since from the known behavior of dark matter, ordinary matter and radiation one\nfinds that any reasonable tracking of these components\nby dark energy always goes at the expense of the late\ntime transition of its equation of state, thus creating a\nnew problem called the \"why now?\" problem. On the\nother hand, if relic neutrinos can be kept tightly coupled to the original dark energy fluid for most of the\nhistory of the universe, the near coincidence at present,\n\u03c1\u039b \u223c \u03c1\u03bd , will cease to be perceptive as a coincidence at\nall. This was possible if the mass of the neutrino was promoted to a dynamical quantity, being a function of the\nacceleron field (canonically normalized scalar field similar\nto quintessence). The main feature of the scenario [16]\nis that although the number density of neutrinos dilutes\ncanonically (\u223c a\u22123 ), the masses of neutrinos change almost inversely (\u223c a\u22123w ), thereby promoting their energy\ndensity to an almost undilutable substance. Hence relic\nneutrinos become tightly coupled to the original dark energy fluid.\nIn addition, by applying the FNW scenario to our\nmodel, in which the energy density for relic neutrinos is\nsupplemented with a term due to nonvanishing electromagnetic moments, we can draw some conclusions about\nintrinsic properties of neutrinos if also |\u03bc| is considered\nas a dynamical field (some function of m\u03bd ). In this case\none can show that in the FNW scenario the EOS for the\ncoupled dark energy fluid obeys\nw+1=\n\nm\u03bd n\u03bd \u2212 2m2\u03bd |\u03bc|2\n.\n\u03c1totaldark\n\n(31)\n\nSince the neutrino contribution gives only a small fraction of the total energy density, we have w \u2243 \u22121, in accordance with what cosmological data imply. Also, the\ndata imply very slow variation of w with a, which, taken\nin a literal sense, means that both terms in the numerator of (31) should scale as \u03c1totaldark \u223c a\u22123(1+w) . This\nentails, m\u03bd \u223c a\u22123w , |\u03bc|2 \u223c a\u22123(1\u2212w) . It is interesting\nto note that although the scaling of m\u03bd and |\u03bc| with a\nare formally different, they become the same in the limit\nw \u2192 \u22121. This complies with the prediction of the minimally extended SM |\u03bc|R \u223c |\u03bc|, where to each generation\nof fermions of the SM a right-handed neutrino field is\nadded, in contrast with more complicated models where\nthe neutrino magnetic moment is disentangled from the\nneutrino mass.\nIn conclusion, we have considered the cosmological consequences of long-range interactions in a nonrelativistic setting and arising from various electromag-\n\n\f5\nnetic form factors of a neutrino. We have emphasised\nthe possibility that the responsible interaction itself has\nan attractive channel, leading neutrino condensation phenomena to occur. This would entail a sort of dark energy,\nresponsible for the late-time acceleration in the expansion\nof the universe. In addition, the energy density due to\nneutrino electromagnetic moments, when superimposed\non the standard contribution of a neutrino background,\nmay be responsible for acceleration phases during the\nhistory of the universe. When implemented in a recently\nsuggested dark energy scenario with mass varying neutrinos, the electromagnetic neutrino interaction may also\nshed some light on intrinsic neutrino properties.\n\nThe work of R.H. and J.T. is supported by the Croatian Ministry of Science, Education and Sport under Contract No. 0980982930-2872 and No. 0980982930-2900.\n\n[1] R.
