In addition, we comment on several investigations that we would like to see targeted\nin preparation for the next NuInt workshop.\n\nals. While we are clearly benefitting from this\nnew data, these results certainly raise new questions. Many of these questions can be answered\nwith data that is currently in hand or that will\nbe collected in the near future. To ensure further progress and resolution of these questions,\nwe present the issues and questions to address in\nthe next NuInt workshop.\n\n1. New Experimental Results\nWe were fortunate that all of the presentations\nin the NuInt05 second session showcased new\nor updated experimental results from a variety\nof experiments. In the case of charged current\n(CC) single \u03c0 + production, this included the\nfirst experimental measurement of CC coherent\npion production at low energy in the K2K SciBar\ndetector [1] and the first measurement of the\nratio of CC 1\u03c0 + to CC quasi-elastic (QE) cross\nsections on a nuclear target at low energy from\nMiniBooNE [2]. NOMAD presented their new\nmeasurements of both QE and inclusive CC cross\nsections on carbon [3]. In addition, MINOS just\nstarted taking beam data a few months before the\nworkshop and presented their first near detector\nneutrino event distributions [4]. In the neutral current (NC) sector, K2K reported the first\nobservation of neutrino-induced photons from\nnuclear de-excitation with the goal of measuring\na NC elastic/QE cross section ratio on water [5].\nThe session ended with presentation of the first\nQE neutrino data in liquid argon from exposure\nof the small ICARUS prototype detector in the\nCERN WANF beam [6].\n\n2. Low Q2 (Q2 < 0.2 GeV2 )\nSince the beginning of the NuInt workshop\nseries, we have seen significant and persistant\ndisagreement at low Q2 between model predictions and data from multiple experiments. This\nis perhaps not very surprising as this is the region\nwhere nuclear corrections are largest and most\nchallenging to model.\nThroughout the course of the NuInt workshops, we have learned that both the K2K and\nMiniBooNE data samples exhibit very similar Q2\nbehavior; also, a larger low Q2 deficit is observed\nin single pion than in QE data. We propose a\ndetailed, quantitative comparison between the\nlow Q2 behavior in all of available CC exclusive\nsamples on various targets and from multiple\nexperiments. This includes comparisons between\nQE, non-QE, and exclusive CC 1\u03c0 + , CC 1\u03c0 0 ,\n\nIn many cases, these presentations added data\nin new energy regions or on new target materi-\n\n1\n\n\f2\nand CC multi-\u03c0 data. It would also be interesting to compare the K2K and MiniBooNE 12 C\nand 16 O data to data on heavier targets such as\n56\nFe (MINOS) and 207 Pb (CHORUS).\nAt this workshop, K2K presented new results [1] indicating that CC coherent \u03c0 + production cross secton calculations are much too\nlarge, hence explaining the observed deficit of\ndata events at low Q2 . This analysis selects a\ncoherent-rich sample by requiring events have low\nQ2 , < 0.1 GeV2 , and by removing events consistent with QE kinematics or which have extra\nactivity at the vertex. While evidence from the\nK2K analyses is compelling, it is important to\ndefinitively settle the low Q2 issue with complementary data. This includes supporting evidence\nfrom other kinematic distributions (e.g., cos \u03b8\u03c0 ,\nand t) as well as cross-checks against CC 1\u03c0 0 data\nwhere there is no expected coherent scattering\ncontribution. In addition, we propose an explicit\nsearch for CC coherent pion production in existing data from MiniBooNE, to be compared to\nthe K2K results.\nAnother interesting avenue of investigation is\nto check, with present data, whether we can claim\nconsistency between observed levels of coherent\npion production in both of the CC \u03c0 + and NC\n\u03c0 0 data samples or whether we are seeing differences between NC and CC coherent pion production. Finally, antineutrino coherent pion production is also of great interest because coherent\npion production cross sections are predicted to\nbe similar for neutrino and antineutrino scattering, and therefore such a deficit should be even\nmore pronounced in antineutrino single pion data\nwhere resonance pion production backgrounds are\nsmaller.\n3. QE Scattering\nWhile we are enjoying the arrival of new, higher\nstatistics QE data from K2K, MiniBooNE, and\nNOMAD, is it really clear that we better understand QE scattering on nuclear targets as a\nresult? At this workshop, it was pointed out that\nK2K and NOMAD are extracting significantly\n\ndifferent axial-vector mass (MA ) parameters from\na dipole fit to the QE axial form factor. To assess\nhow meaningful these differences are, it is imperative that we establish a common formalism with\nwhich to directly compare experimental results.\nWith identical nuclear models and modern vector\nform factors [7], we need to reassess the range\nof MA values extracted from modern QE data\non a variety of targets (12 C, 16 O, 56 Fe, 40 Ar).\nWhat impact do different levels of backgrounds,\nefficiencies, and selection biases have on these\nresults? How do the results obtained from rate\nversus shape (d\u03c3/dQ2 ) fits compare? What do\nsimilar fits to single pion distributions yield for\nMA ?\nCan more information be added? Is there anything to be gained by refitting old neutrino data\non heavy targets? What are the prospects for\nMiniBooNE antineutrino QE data and MA fits?\nCan similar fits be performed on 56 Fe at MINOS [4] or with liquid argon data [6]? The current state of affairs demands a concerted effort to\nreassess QE (and more specifically, axial-vector)\nparameters measured from modern heavy target\ndata.\n4. New Data\nWe also encourage the collection of new data\nsets. It is also important that we continue to build\nup our body of knowledge on low energy neutrino cross section by adding new experimental\ndata. This new data may, of course, help clarify\nsome of the questions being raised by the current\ndatasets or have the potential to raise new ones.\nSpecifically, CC 1\u03c0 0 data can aid in disentangling\nresonant and coherent pion production at low Q2 .\nStudies of coherent scattering at MINERvA [8]\nand theoretical studies [9] indicate that kinematic\nseparation of resonant scattering from coherent\nscattering may be easier at higher energies. Samples of \u03bde QE interactions serve as a direct check\nof the predicted d\u03c3/dQ2 distributions in \u03bde versus\n\u03bd\u03bc events. Also, any new information on antineutrino scattering and scattering from other nuclear\ntargets at both higher and lower A than carbon\nor oxygen are, of course, always welcome.\n\n\f3\n5. New Theoretical Models\n\n7. Acknowledgements\n\nIt is essential that we maintain a continued effort to pit modern neutrino data against modern theoretical models. Theories advance most\nquickly when confronted with data on an equal\nfooting. At this workshop, we have seen many examples of new theoretical calculations that could\nhelp experimentalists move beyond their antiquated Fermi Gas and Rein-Sehgal based Monte\nCarlos. At the same time, experiments need actual code as well as guidance on how to implement\nnew theoretical predictions in regions where they\nare valid. To move forward, we encourage continued communication between theorists and experimentalists toward this end.\n\nThe Session 2 convenors sincerely thank\nMakoto Sakuda and Okayama University for graciously hosting this workshop. Intellectual discourse never blossoms more fruitfully than it did\nin Okayama in the inspiring presence of the perfect grapes.\n\n6. Conclusions\nWe challenge the next NuInt workshop to explicitly target the questions being raised by current experimental data. Specifically:\n\u2022 How well do we understand the axial-vector\nform factor contribution to QE and resonant scattering?\n\u2022 Do we have a consistent framework to compare results from different experiments?\n\u2022 Do we truly understand the behavior at low\nQ2 in all of our data samples?\n\u2022 Do we see any obstacles to incorporating\nnew theoretical calculations into our experimental descriptions?\n\u2022 Are there any other data samples that\nshould be studied in addition to those that\nhave been reported in this and previous\nNuInt workshops?\nWe hope that we can continue to make progress\nby isolating new data samples and working toward detailed comparisons between various experimental results. It is clear that we need to\nforge ahead on all fronts in order to fully clarify\nthese remaining issues.\n\nREFERENCES\n1.\n2.\n3.\n4.\n5.\n6.\n7.\n8.\n9.\n\nH. Tanaka, these proceedings.\nM. O.
