The simultaneous consideration of both interaction and interference effects is a\nnowadays topic in mesoscopic physics and many efforts have been done to overcome the\nspecific theoretical difficulties. One of the main tools is the Keldysh transport formalism,\nthat requires the knowledge of the retarded and lesser Green functions (e.g. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]).\nThe general expression of the current through the lead indexed by \u03b1 is :\nZ\n2e \u221e\nJ\u03b1 =\nd\u03c9 i\u0393\u03b1 {f\u03b1 (\u03c9)[Gr\u03b1\u03b1 (\u03c9) \u2212 Ga\u03b1\u03b1 (\u03c9)] + G<\n\u03b1\u03b1 (\u03c9)} ,\nh \u2212\u221e\n\n(1)\n\nwhere f\u03b1 is the Fermi distribution function in the \u03b1 electrode and \u0393\u03b1 = \u03c0\u03c4\u03b12 \u03c1, with the usual\nnotations.\nMost of the papers discuss the Single Impurity Anderson Model (SIAM), in which case a\nsimplified version of the formalism can be employed. In this model, the two leads are connected to the same site, which mimics the quantum dot, and in this situation the knowledge\nof the retarded Green function is sufficient for describing the transport properties (as the\nlesser Green function is eliminated by current symmetrization)[1]. Only a few papers go\nbeyond this model by introducing in the Hamiltonian a term which produces a short-cut of\nthe impurity, mimicking a mesoscopic ring [6, 7]. In the non-interacting case, eq.(1) can be\nshown to give the Landauer-B\u00fcttiker result, that was widely employed.\nThe implementation of the Keldysh formalism for the general case of a many-site, multiple\nconnected system with interaction is not trivial. Second order perturbative calculations\nhave been applied for the case of the electron-phonon interaction[3, 4] or in the context\nof dephasing [5], but such perturbative approaches cannot be applied in the case of strong\nelectronic correlations. Recently, Entin-Wohlman et al. [8] and Kashcheyevs et al. [9]\ndeveloped an equation-of-motion solution for Gr in any complex geometry described by a\ntight-binding model, but not for G< . The calculation of G< in the strong interaction regime\nis a more difficult task and requires supplementary decoupling approximations [2, 10].\nA solution to this problem was also suggested [11, 12] by diagonalizing the interacting\nHamiltonian in the slave-boson representation. Then the knowledge of the retarded Green\nfunction is sufficient again, but the approach restricts the range of validity of the transport\n2\n\n\fcalculation as the mixed valence regime is not correctly described. Another way to get\nrid of G< was proposed in [13] by imposing stationarity conditions on the mean values of\nsome non-hermitic operators, the meaning of which is not obvious to us (especially under\nnon-equilibrium conditions).\nIn this paper we propose two different approaches. One is to approximate the lesser Green\nfunctions by using the Ng's ansatz [14]. Another possibility is to write down the system of\nequations of motion for G<\nij (where i,j index any site of the system) and express the current\nr\n(1) in terms of G<\ndd and Gdd (the index 'd' means the interacting site). It will be shown that,\n\nfor the particular case of left-right and time-reversal symmetry, G<\ndd can be eliminated by\nsymmetrization of the current formula. The result is better in this case than by using Ng's\nansatz, since no approximations are introduced in the current formula.\nThe application is done for the triangle system in the inset of Fig.1 which is the simplest\nmultiple connected system with two leads. This system is typical for the study of Fano and\nFano-Kondo effects.\n\nII.\n\nMODEL AND TECHNIQUES.\n\nOur approach is based on the following Hamiltonian written in a discrete basis :\nX\n\u0001\n\u01ebk\u03b1 \u2212 \u03bc\u03b1 c\u2020k\u03b1,\u03c3 ck\u03b1,\u03c3 + Hmeso ({a\u2020i , ai }) + HT ,\nH=\n\n(2)\n\nk,\u03c3,\u03b1\n\nwhere the mesoscopic system contains an interacting site indexed by d:\nX\nX\nHmeso =\nEi a\u2020i\u03c3 ai\u03c3 +\n(tij a\u2020i\u03c3 aj\u03c3 + H.c.) + Hint (a\u2020d\u03c3 , ad\u03c3 )\ni\u03c3\n\n(3)\n\nij\u03c3\n\nand the tunneling term is of the following form\nX\nHT =\n(\u03c4\u03b1 c\u2020k\u03b1,\u03c3 a\u03b1,\u03c3 + H.c.),\n\n(4)\n\nk,\u03c3,\u03b1\n\nwhere \u03b1 is the lead index (in c\u2020k\u03b1,\u03c3 ), but also stands for the site where the lead is attached (in\na\u03b1,\u03c3 ); \u03c4\u03b1 is the coupling constant. Hint may describe any interaction which implies the site\n\"d\", such as Hubbard or electron-phonon (photon) interaction, the electrostatic coupling\nto external detectors, etc. The equations of motion for the lesser Green functions can be\nwritten as [15]:\nX\n\n2 < r a\nr\n<\n(\u03b4ik \u2212 gir tik )G<\nkj = \u03c4\u03b1 g\u03b1 gi Gij + gi tid Gdj ,\n\nk(6=d)\n\n3\n\ni, j 6= d.\n\n(5)\n\n\fIn the above equation we use the following notations: gir = (\u03c9 \u2212Ei + i\u0393i )\u22121 and g\u03b1< = 2i\u03c0\u03c1f\u03b1\nis the lesser Green function of the lead \u03b1 which is coupled to the site \"i\"; \u03c1 is the flat band\ndensity of states. The solution of eq.(5) reads\n\u0001\n\u22121\n2 < r a\nr\n<\nG<\nij = (A )ik \u03c4\u03b1 g\u03b1 gk Gkj + gk tkd Gdj ,\n\n(6)\n\nwhere the summation over \"k\" is assumed, and the notation Aik = \u03b4ik \u2212 gir tik have been\nused. The function G<\ndj in eq.(6) can be obtained in a similar way:\n\u2217 \u22121\nG<\ndj = (A )\n\nwhere gka = (gkr )\u2217 .\n\n\u0001\n\njk\n\n\u03c4\u03b12 g\u03b1< gka Grdk + gka tdk G<\ndd\n\n\u0001\n\n(7)\n\nOne notices that G<\nij can be expressed in terms of the retarded (advanced) Green func<\ntions and G<\ndd . The calculation of Gdd still remains a problem and several approximate\n\nsolutions can be used, as for instance the Ng's ansatz described later. However, an important simplification occurs in the symmetric two-lead case when, after the symmetrization\nJ = (J\u03b1 \u2212 J\u03b2 )/2, the current becomes independent of G<\ndd :\n(\nZ\n2e\nJ=\nd\u03c9\u0393\u03b1(f\u03b1 \u2212 f\u03b2 ) \u2212 ImGr\u03b1\u03b1 +\nh\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f9)\nX\nX\n+\n(A\u22121 )\u03b1\u03b3 g\u03b3r \uf8f0(\u22121)\u03b4\u03b1\u03b3 \u0393\u03b3 Ga\u03b3\u03b1 + t\u03b3d\n(\u22121)\u03b4\u03b1\u03b3\u2032 ((A\u2217 )\u22121 )\u03b1\u03b3 \u2032 \u0393\u03b3 \u2032 g\u03b3a\u2032 Grd\u03b3 \u2032 \uf8fb .\n\u03b3(6=d)\n\n(8)\n\n\u03b3 \u2032 (6=d)\n\nThe above equation represents the main formal result of this paper. The current J was\n\nexpressed solely in terms of different retarded Green functions, for the symmetric case. The\nsymmetry is necessary in order to get the same coefficient of G<\ndd both in the expression of J\u03b1\nand J\u03b2 , so that G<\ndd is eliminated by the symmetrization (J\u03b1 \u2212 J\u03b2 )/2 . One can notice that\nthe SIAM formula is recovered by the first term in eq.(8). Eq.(8) contains many retarded\nGreen functions, but, in fact, all of them can be expressed in terms of Grdd , as for instance:\n\u0001\nGrd\u03b3 = A\u22121 \u03b3\u03b2 g\u03b2r td\u03b2 Grdd .\nNg's ansatz . The lesser Green function G< = Gr \u03a3< Ga is approximated by assuming\n\nthat \u03a3< = \u03a30< M [14] where the matrix M is deduced from the relation \u03a3< \u2212 \u03a3> = \u03a3r \u2212 \u03a3a\n. The result is :\n\u03a3< = \u03a30< (\u03a30r \u2212 \u03a30a )\u22121 (\u03a3r \u2212 \u03a3a ).\n\n4\n\n(9)\n\n\fThe intention is again to keep in the final formula only retarded quantities and noninteracting functions (trivial to calculate). The non-interacting selfenergies , for the two\nlead system read :\n\uf8eb\n\n\u03a30< = \uf8ed\n\nf\u03b1 0\n0 f\u03b2\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8f8 (\u03a30r \u2212 \u03a30a )\n\uf8eb\n\n\u03a30r \u2212 \u03a30a = \u2212i \uf8ed\n\n\u0393\u03b1 0\n\n0 \u0393\u03b2\n\n(10)\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8f8.\n\nIt is now straightforward to express the quantities required by the current formula eq.(1) as\n:\nr\nr\na\na\nr\nr\na\na\nG<\n\u03b1\u03b1 = \u2212G\u03b1\u03b1 f\u03b1 [(\u03a3 \u2212 \u03a3 )G ]\u03b1\u03b1 \u2212 G\u03b1\u03b2 f\u03b2 [(\u03a3 \u2212 \u03a3 )G ]\u03b2\u03b1\n\n(11)\n\nf\u03b1 (Gr \u2212 Ga )\u03b1\u03b1 = f\u03b1 [Gr (\u03a3r \u2212 \u03a3a )Ga ]\u03b1\u03b1 = Gr\u03b1\u03b1 f\u03b1 [(\u03a3r \u2212 \u03a3a )Ga ]\u03b1\u03b1 + Gr\u03b1\u03b2 f\u03b1 [(\u03a3r \u2212 \u03a3a )Ga ]\u03b2\u03b1 .\nFinally, the current formula becomes :\n2ie\nJ\u03b1 =\nh\n\nZ\n\nd\u03c9(f\u03b1 \u2212 f\u03b2 )\u0393\u03b1 Gr\u03b1\u03b2 [(\u03a3r \u2212 \u03a3a )Ga ]\u03b2\u03b1 .\n\n(12)\n\nThe same scheme was used in [16, 17], but for a different problem, namely the spin transport\nthrough a single-site dot coupled to magnetic leads.\n\nIII.\n\nAPPLICATION AND DISCUSSIONS.\n\nThe exact formula eq.(8) will be applied to the particular case of a triangular interferometer with Hubbard interaction Hint = Ua\u2020d\u2191 ad\u2191 a\u2020d\u2193 ad\u2193 . In the previous section, we reached\nour goal of expressing the current through the retarded Green functions only. One important advantage is that there are already recipes for computing these functions in different\napproximations. We shall use the scheme proposed by Entin-Wohlman et al [8] for U \u2192 \u221e.\nThe choice is justified by the simple analytical formulae which have an easy implementation.\nThe triangular system is a good tool for studying the interplay between correlation and\ninterference processes. The non-interacting conductance (curve no.3 in Fig.1) shows a typical\nFano line presenting both a Fano zero and a perfect constructive interference. This is the\nresult of the interference between the partial waves passing the dot and the reference arm.\n\n5\n\n\fConductance (2e2/h)\n\n1.0\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\n2\nbackground\n\n0.6\n\n(1) Eq. 8\n\n0.4\n\n0.2\n\n0.0\n-0.5\n\n(3) non - interacting\n\n(2) Ng ansatz\n\n-0.4\n\n-0.3\n\n-0.2\n\n-0.1\n\n0.0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\nEd\n\nFIG. 1: Conductance through the triangular interferometer (see inset): (1) using exact formula\n(Eq.8), (2) with Ng's ansatz (Eq.12), and (3) for non-interacting case. The parameters are E1 =\nE2 = EF ermi = 0, \u0393 = 0.025, t12 = t1d = t2d = 0.02, T = 10\u221220 (measured in units of half-band\nwidth). The horizontal line represents the asymptotic value for Ed going to \u00b1\u221e .\n\nIn the Kondo regime the dot transmits through the Kondo peak and the transmission\nphase is \"frozen\" at \u03c0/2 (as measured also experimentally in [18, 19]). The result consists\nin a much slower variation of the interference conditions giving rise to a Fano line of reduced\namplitude compared to the non-interacting case. This is known as the Fano-Kondo effect\nand is described by the curve no.1 in Fig.1.\nSignificant differences can be noticed between the conductance obtained by using the\nexact formula eq.(8) and the Ng's approximation eq.(12) [20]. The differences are rather\nlarge, indicating that the Ng's ansatz does not capture well the combined effect of correlation\nand interference. Fig.1 shows that the destructive interference is overestimated. When the\ndot is empty (Ed & 0.1) all the three curves coincide, as expected. The main control\nparameter (also in experiments) is the position on the energy scale of the atomic energy\nEd which can be changed by applying an external bias . Asymptotically, for |Ed | \u2192 \u221e,\nthe interacting site \"d\" is decoupled from the other sites; consequently the transport is\nperformed only through the background branch (i.e., that one connecting the sites \"1\" and\n\"2\"). The background conductance is also plotted in Fig.1 and represents the control limit\nof our calculations. In the range of the gate potential where the correlations are important,\nthe temperature dependence is expected to be of Kondo- type ,i.e. the conductance increases\n6\n\n\f1.0\n\n0.9\n\n0.8\n\nConductance (2e2/h)\n\nConductance (2e2/h)\n\n0.6\n\n0.7\n\n0.5\n0.4\n0.3\n0.2\n0.1\n0.0\n-0.10\n\n-0.05\n\n0.00\n\n0.05\n\nEd\n\n0.6\n(4)\n\n(3)\n\n(2)\n\n(1)\n\n(a)\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\nConductance (2e2/h)\n\n0.9\n0.8\n0.7\n0.6\n(4)\n\n0.5\n(3)\n\n0.4\n0.3\n0.2\n-0.5\n\n(2)\n\n(b)\n\n(1)\n\n-0.4\n\n-0.3\n\n-0.2\n\n-0.1\n\n0.0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\nEd\n\nFIG. 2: a) The crossing point exhibited by the current curves calculated at different temperatures\nin the range [T = 10\u221220 \u2212 10\u22123 ]. Curve (1) is for the lowest temperature. Other parameters are\nthe same as in Fig.1. The inset shows the same behavior for the T-shape system. b) The same\ncurves calculated with Ng's approximation, which misses the crossing point.\n\nwith decreasing temperature. However, when multiple paths are possible (and interference\nplays an important role), an increased transparency of the quantum dot may give rise, on\nthe contrary, to a reduced conductance of the whole system. The interference conditions\ncan be changed by a magnetic field (as in [6]) or by variation of the gate potential as we are\ndoing here.\nThe isotherms of the conductance g = dJ/d\u03bc plotted in Fig.2 show two different temperature regimes separated by a crossing point: on the right the conductance decreases with T ,\nand behaves oppositely on the left side. Our calculation determines the crossing point with\nan accuracy within numerical errors, and suggests that there is a gate potential Edc such that\ndg(Edc , T )/dT = 0.\n7\n\n(13)\n\n\f1.0\n\nPhase\n\n0.8\n\n(3)\n\n(2)\n\n(4)\n\n0.6\n(1)\n\n0.4\n\n0.2\n\n0.0\n-0.5\n\n-0.4\n\n-0.3\n\n-0.2\n\n-0.1\n\n0.0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\nEd\n\nFIG. 3: The phase of Grdd (in units \u03c0) for the same parameters as in Fig.2; the stars indicate the\ngate potentials where the Kondo temperature equals the plot temperature. The curve (1) is still\nin Kondo regime at Ed = \u22120.5.\n\nThe same crossing point was found for a more simple model, namely the T-shape system.\nThe T-shape geometry consists of two coupled quantum dots, only one of them (the noninteracting dot) being connected to leads. The advantage of this more simple model is that\nthe conductance is simply expressed by the density of states at the site connected to leads\n(details are found in, e.g. [8]) and the effect of the interference is more obvious. Basically,\nthe T-shape and the triangle describe the same Fano-Kondo physics; the triangle is however\na technical challenge and the first step versus more realistic models.\nThe DoS at the Kondo dot always shows the specific Kondo peak at the Fermi energy.\nHowever, the DoS at the coupling site may show a Kondo peak or dip depending on the\nconstructive or destructive interference conditions, respectively. The two cases give opposite\ntemperature behavior. The interference conditions gradually change with the applied gate,\ngiving rise to regions with opposite temperature dependence separated by a crossing point\n(see inset of Fig.2). The existence of this point seems to be a fingerprint of the Fano-Kondo\neffect in systems with interaction and interference. The use of the exact formula eq.8 is\nessential, since the Ng's approximation eq.12 misses the crossing point (as can be noticed\nin Fig.2b). This shows that the Ng's approximations fails not only quantitatively but also\nqualitatively.\nIf we intend to identify the gate interval where Kondo correlations are important, one\n8\n\n\fhas to calculate the Kondo temperature. Another visualization of the Kondo region is to\nplot the phase of the dot Green function\n\u03c6 = atan(ImGdd /ReGdd ),\n\n(14)\n\nthat is known to \"freeze\" at the value \u03c0/2 in the Kondo regime. The phase is plotted in Fig.3\nfor several temperatures, and on each curve, we mark the point where the Kondo temperature\nequals the temperature of the curve. The Kondo temperature was computed with the\nHaldane [8, 21] formula. One can notice from Fig.3 that the crossing point Ed \u2248 \u22120.05 (see\nFig.2) is indeed in the Kondo regime. For higher temperatures we have checked that the\nisotherms no longer pass through the crossing point as the transport is no more governed\nby the Kondo physics.\nIn conclusion, we have developed an exact current formula easy to apply to multipleconnected meso-systems. The advantage of the formula is that it uses only retarded Green\nfunctions and can be applied to any system with left-right and time reversal symmetry\nwith one-site interaction. In the absence of the symmetries we give an alternative approach\nbased on the Ng's ansatz, which nevertheless is not sufficiently accurate for describing the\ncorrelations. It has been found that the interplay between the Kondo correlation and the interference effect gives rise to different temperature behaviors depending on the gate potential\napplied on the interacting dot, separated by a crossing point.\nAcknowledgements.
