The work of Strominger\nand Vafa [1] which is known as the first attempt to calculate entropy of black holes by\ncounting the corresponding microstates implies that, in principle any gravity solution should\nhave various CFT duals.\nA recent approach in this direction is the Kerr/CFT correspondence [2], which is intrinsically a generalization of Brown-Henneaux approach [3, 4] to AdS/CFT correspondence\n[5, 6, 7]. Extremal Kerr-AdS metrics in 5, 6 and 7 dimensions are studied in [8], and\nBMPV black hole is studied in [9]. CFT dual of 5D extremal rotating Kaluza-Klein black\nholes is investigated in [10]. Some examples of extremal black hole/CFT correspondence\nin 4D and 5D gauged and ungauged supergravities are considered in [11]. Embedding of\nsuch correspondence in string theory for some 5D solutions is studied in [12, 13]. All of\nthese calculations are based on the periodicity of the circles of the near horizon metric\nand enhancement of the corresponding U(1) symmetries to the Virasoro of a dual chiral\nCFT. By choosing special boundary conditions, it is shown that there is a CFT dual associated to each of the circles, with the same CFT entropy that is in agreement with the\nBekenstein-Hawking entropy.\nIn this paper we study the moduli space of the near horizon metric of five dimensional\nextremal rotating black holes that are asymptotically flat or AdS. We show that there is\nan SL(2,Z) modular group generated by the usual transformations \u03c4 \u2192 \u03c4 + 1 and \u03c4 \u2192\n\u22121/\u03c4 , where \u03c4 is a definite moduli of the geometry, that leaves the Bekenstein-Hawking\nentropy invariant. The operation \u03c4 \u2192 \u22121/\u03c4 interchanges the two circles of the near horizon\ngeometry, so maps the CFT's corresponding to these circles into each other. The operator\n\u03c4 \u2192 \u03c4 +1 leaves one of the circles intact but adds it once to the other circle. These operations\nare symmetries of the near horizon geometry but map a given CFT dual to another CFT.\nThus the SL(2,Z) modular group assigns a lattice of CFT duals corresponding to the moduli\npoints identified under the action of the modular group. By using the Cardy formula we\nshow that the CFT entropy of all of these CFTs are equivalent and are in precise agreement\nwith the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy.\nThe organization of this paper is as follows. In section \u00a72, we study the moduli space of\nthe near horizon geometry of 5D extremal rotating black holes that are asymptotically flat or\nAdS. In section \u00a73 we use the Brown-Henneaux method to define the Virasoro generators\n1\n\n\fin terms of the asymptotic symmetry group of near horizon geometry and compute the\nassociated central charge. In section \u00a74 by studying the behavior of the matter field near\nthe horizon of the black hole we compute the Frolov-Thorne (FT) temperature [17] and the\nCFT entropy for the lattice of the CFT duals. The consistency of boundary conditions is\nshown in section \u00a75.\n\n2\n\nExtremal 5D Rotating Black Holes\n\nIn the Brown-Henneaux method [3, 4], the first step to construct the CFT dual to a geometry, is to realize the metric of the near horizon geometry [2, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]. The\ngeneral form of near horizon of rotating black holes in 5D that are asymptotically flat or\nAdS is given in [14]. In this paper we follow the conventions of [11],\nds2 = \u2212(1 + r\u0302 2 l\u22122 )dt\u03022 +\n\ndr\u0302 2\n+ r\u0302 2 (d\u03b82 + cos2 \u03b8d\u03c6\u030221 + sin2 \u03b8d\u03c6\u030222 ),\n1 + r\u0302 2 l\u22122\n\n(1)\n\nwhere l\u22122 is the cosmological constant. For deriving the near horizon geometry of the\nextremal limit, it is suitable to use the following coordinate transformations [11]\nr\u0302 = r0 (1 + \u03b5r),\n\n\u03c6\u03021 = \u03c61 + \u03a901 t\u0302,\n\n\u03c6\u03022 = \u03c62 + \u03a902 t\u0302,\n\nt\u0302 =\n\nt\n,\n\u2032\n2\u03c0r0 TH0 \u03b5\n\n(2)\n\nwhere r0 is the radius of horizon in the extremal limit, \u03a90i are the angular velocities on\n\u2032\nthe horizon, and the quantity TH0 is derivative of Hawking temperature with respect to the\nouter horizon radius at itself,\n\u2202TH\n\u2032\nTH0 :=\n.\n(3)\n\u2202r+ r+ =r0\nThe near horizon metric of the extremal five dimensional black hole is obtained in the\n\u03b5 \u2192 0, which gives\n\u0010\n\u0011\ndr 2\n2\n2 2\nds = A(\u03b8) \u2212r dt + r2 + F (\u03b8)d\u03b82 + B1 (\u03b8)(e1 + C(\u03b8)e2 )2 + B2 (\u03b8)e22 ,\n(4)\ne1 = d\u03c61 + k1 rdt,\ne2 = d\u03c62 + k2 rdt,\nwhere A, Bi , C and F are only functions of \u03b8 , 0 \u2264 \u03c6i \u2264 2\u03c0 and 0 \u2264 \u03b8 \u2264 \u03c0. This metric can\nbe viewed as an S3 bundle over AdS2 . The constants ki = (2\u03c0Ti )\u22121 , in which Ti are the FT\ntemperatures defined as follows [11],\n\u2032\n\nT0\nTH\n= \u2212 H\u2032 0 .\nTi = lim 0\nr+ \u2192r0 \u03a9 \u2212 \u03a9i\n\u03a9i\ni\n\n(5)\n\nThus the parameter space of asymptotically flat or AdS 5D black holes, is seven dimensional\nwith parameters A, Bi , C, F, ki.\nThe last two terms of the metric (4) can be realized as a torus\nds2T2 = (R1 )2 |e1 + \u03c4 e2 |2 ,\nwhere\nR1 =\n\np\n\n(6)\nr\n\nB1 ,\n\n\u03c4 =C +i\n2\n\nB2\n.\nB1\n\n(7)\n\n\fThe generators of the SL(2,Z) modular group of T2 are\n1\n\u03c4 \u2192\u2212 ,\n\u03c4\n\n\u03c4 \u2192 \u03c4 + 1.\n\n(8)\n\nThe action of the modular group of the torus can be extended to the parameter space of\nthe near horizon geometry (4) as follows\n(C, B1, B2 , k1 , k2) \u2192 (\u2212C|\u03c4 |\u22122 , B1 |\u03c4 |2 , B2 |\u03c4 |\u22122 , \u2212k2 , k1 ),\n(C, B1, B2 , k1 , k2) \u2192 (C + 1, B1 , B2 , k1 \u2212 k2 , k2 ),\n\n(9)\n(10)\n\nwith A and F invariant. The corresponding change in the metric (4) can be compensated\nby a redefinition of the \u03c6i coordinates given by\n\u03c61 \u2192 \u03c6\u03031 = \u2212\u03c62 ,\n\u03c61 \u2192 \u03c6\u03031 = \u03c61 \u2212 \u03c62 ,\n\n\u03c62 \u2192 \u03c6\u03032 = \u03c61 ,\n\u03c62 \u2192 \u03c6\u03032 = \u03c62 .\n\n(11)\n(12)\n\nThus, the SL(2,Z) modular transformations (9) and (10) are symmetries of the near horizon\ngeometry (4).3 Consequently, the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy for the extremal black hole\nZ\np\n1\nSBH =\nd\u03b8d\u03c61 d\u03c62 F (\u03b8)B1 (\u03b8)B2 (\u03b8),\n(13)\n4\nis invariant under the SL(2,Z) modular group. Here and henceforth we set G5 = 1.\n\n3\n\nAsymptotic Symmetry Group\n\nThe asymptotic symmetry group (ASG) of a near horizon metric is the group of allowed\nsymmetries modulo trivial symmetries.
