Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) generate an afterglow emission that can be detected from radio to X-rays during days, or even\nweeks after the initial explosion. The peak of this emission crosses the millimeter and submillimeter range during the first hours\nto days, making their study in this range crucial for constraining the models. Observations have been limited until now due to the\nlow sensitivity of the observatories in this range. This situation will be greatly improved with the start of scientific operations of the\nAtacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA).\nAims. In this work we do a statistical analysis of the complete sample of mm/submm observations of GRB afterglows obtained before\nthe beginning of scientific operations at ALMA.\nMethods. We present observations of 11 GRB afterglows obtained from the Atacama Pathfinder Experiment (APEX) and the\nSubMillimeter Array (SMA), as well as the first detection of a GRB with ALMA, still in the commissioning phase, and put them\ninto context with a catalogue of all the observations that have been published until now in the spectral range that is covered by\nALMA.\nResults. The catalogue of mm/submm observations collected here is the largest to date and is composed of 102 GRBs, of which 88\nhave afterglow observations, whereas the rest are host galaxy searches. With our programmes, we contributed with data of 11 GRBs\nand the discovery of 2 submm counterparts. In total, the full sample, including data from the literature, has 22 afterglow detections\nwith redshifts ranging from 0.168 to 8.2. GRBs have been detected in mm/submm wavelengths with peak luminosities spanning 2.5\norders of magnitude, the most luminous reaching 1033 erg s\u22121 Hz\u22121 . We observe a correlation between the X-ray brightness at 0.5 days\nand the mm/submm peak brightness. Finally we give a rough estimate of the distribution of peak flux densities of GRB afterglows,\nbased on the current mm/submm sample.\nConclusions. Observations in the mm/submm bands have been shown to be crucial for our understanding of the physics of GRBs,\nbut have until now been limited by the sensitivity of the observatories. With the start of the operations at ALMA, the sensitivity\nhas improved by more than an order of magnitude, opening a new era in the study of GRB afterglows and their host galaxies. Our\nestimates predict that, once completed, ALMA will detect up to \u223c 98% of the afterglows if observed during the passage of the peak\nsynchrotron emission.\nKey words.

Introduction\n\u22c6\nThis publication is partially based on data acquired with the\nAtacama Pathfinder Experiment (APEX) under programmes 082.F9850, 084.D-0732, 086.D-0590, 086.F-9303(A) and 087.F-9301(A)\nand with the Submillimeter Array (SMA) under programmes 2009BS015, 2010A-S004 and 2010B-S026. This paper makes use of the following ALMA commissioning data set: 2011.0.99001.CSV.\n\nGamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are the brightest explosions in the\nUniverse, releasing isotropic equivalent energies in the range of\n1051 \u2013 1054 ergs (of the order of 1051 ergs once corrected for\ncollimation) within a few seconds. They were serendipitously\ndiscovered in 1967 (Klebesadel et al. 1973) in gamma-rays, but\n1\n\n\fA. de Ugarte Postigo et al.: Pre-ALMA observations of GRBs in the mm/submm range\n\nit was not until 1997 that the first counterparts were detected\nat other wavelengths (van Paradijs et al. 1997; Frail et al. 1997;\nCosta et al. 1997; Bremer et al. 1998). Thanks to the observation\nof the fading X-ray emission, which follows the more energetic\ngamma-ray photons, and the rapid distribution of the X-ray coordinates (much more precise than the gamma-ray ones), it is possible to carry out multiwavelength observations of the counterparts associated with GRBs within seconds of their occurrence.\nThe late time emission, detectable at all wavelengths and observable for days after the burst onset (and some times significantly\nlonger), is what we call GRB afterglow.\nIt is widely accepted that long GRBs (those with durations\nabove \u223c2 s) are related to the collapse of massive stars (Woosley\n1993; Paczy\u0144ski 1998; Hjorth et al. 2003) while short GRBs\n(shorter than \u223c2 s) are probably originated by the coalescence\nof two compact objects, such as two neutron stars or a neutron star and a black hole (Paczynski 1990; Narayan et al. 1992;\nLevan et al. 2006; Chattopadhyay et al. 2007; King et al. 2007).\nIn both scenarios, the result is the ejection of material at ultrarelativistic speeds, most probably through jets. This is what we call\nthe relativistic fireball model (Rees & Meszaros 1992; Sari et al.\n1998). In this framework, a compact source releases \u223c 1051 ergs\nof energy within dozens of seconds in a region smaller than 10\nkm. When the ejecta run into the surrounding medium, a forward shock sweeps the surroundings of the progenitor, producing an afterglow as the ejecta interact with the interstellar matter.\nA reverse shock, colliding with the ejecta, can also produce an\nadditional emission during early times (Piran 1999).\nUntil now, millimeter and especially submillimeter observations of GRBs have been scarce due to the small number of available observatories and limited sensitivity, as compared to other\nwavelength ranges. As examples of large samples of afterglow\ndata see, for example, Evans et al. (2009) in X-rays, Kann et al.\n(2010) in optical, and more recently Chandra & Frail (2011) in\nradio. The mm/submm range suffers strongly from atmospheric\nabsorption, mostly due to water vapour. This means that observatories have to be placed in high and dry mountain sites.\nNevertheless, the study of GRBs in these wavelengths is of great\ninterest, as the peak (in flux density) of the synchrotron afterglow\nemission, and even the one due to the reverse shock (see Sect. 3.1\nfor a description of the emission mechanisms), is expected to be\nlocated in this wavelength range during the first days. It has also\nthe benefit of being a wavelength range that is not affected by\ninterstellar extinction, as are the optical or soft X-rays, allowing\nus to detect highly-extinguished and high-redshift bursts. This\nrange is also normally above the self-absorption frequency of the\nspectrum, below which the flux is strongly suppressed. Finally,\nas compared to centimeter and decimeter wavelengths, this range\nis not affected by interstellar scintillation, allowing more accurate modelling with fewer observations.\nPioneering submm observations of GRB afterglows, made\nwith JCMT/SCUBA (e.g. Smith et al. 1999, 2001) in the submm\nand with various facilities in the mm (e.g. Bremer et al. 1998;\nGalama et al. 2000), showed that emission in these wavelengths\ncould be detected in some cases, and provided the first tests\nof the fireball model using full radio to X-ray SEDs (e.g.\nWijers & Galama 1999). However, detections were generally of\nlow significance, and progress in the Swift era was restricted until recently by the dearth of submm bolometer array instruments\n(following the retirement of SCUBA on JCMT, and until the advent of LABOCA on APEX).\nOn the 30th September 2011 ALMA came into operation, to\nrevolutionise mm/submm astronomy. ALMA is at an altitude of\n5000 m in the Llano de Chajnantor, in northern Chile, one of the\n2\n\nbest sites for this kind of observations in the world. In its early\nscience phase it has 16 antennas of 12 m, and in full operations\n(expected for 2013) it will increase to a total of 50 antennas of 12\nm in diameter plus a compact array (the Atacama Compact Array\n- ACA) of 12 7 m antennas and four 12 m antennas. This will be\nthe largest facility for mm/submm astronomy and will improve\nsensitivity and spatial resolution in over an order of magnitude\nwith respect to previous observatories.\nIn this paper we collect all the data, to our best knowledge,\nthat have been published for GRBs in the mm/submm range,\nto which we add observations from our observing programmes\nfrom APEX and the SMA. The observations are completed with\nthe first ALMA observation of a GRB, during the commissioning phase of the observatory, as a test of the target of opportunity\nprocedures. Using this sample, we give a review of the past experience and put it into context of the forthcoming ALMA era.\nWe give some examples of single-epoch spectral energy distributions but do not attempt full broadband modelling for individual\nbursts as it is beyond the scope of this paper.\nSection 2 describes the data of 11 bursts collected with\nour observing programmes. Section 3 presents the catalogue of\nmm/submm GRB data. In Section 4 we describe the capabilities\nof ALMA compared with previous observatories and discuss its\nfuture role in the field. Finally, Section 5 lists our conclusions.\nThroughout the paper we assume a cosmology with \u03a9m = 0.30,\n\u03a9\u039b = 0.70, and H0 = 70.\n\nFig. 1. Observation of GRB 090313 with APEX (contours are\n1, 2, 3 and 4\u03c3 detection levels) in March 2009 plotted over an\noptical X-shooter acquisition image showing the position of the\nafterglow. The field of view is 90\u2032\u2032 \u00d7 70\u2032\u2032 . Only a field galaxy,\nunassociated with the GRB is detected, and we impose a 3sigma upper limit of 9 mJy for the afterglow (adapted from\nde Ugarte Postigo et al. 2010c; Melandri et al. 2010).\n\n2. Observations\nOn March 2009 we performed the first observation of a GRB\n(GRB 090313) using the 12 m, single-dish, APEX telescope (in\nChajnantor, Chile; G\u00fcsten et al. 2006) at 345 GHz, as a feasibility test, during a technical night through a Director Discretionary\nTime programme. Since then, we have had several observing programmes at APEX, with which we have followed-up 6\nGRBs (plus an additional Galactic X-ray binary, initially iden-\n\n\fA. de Ugarte Postigo et al.: Pre-ALMA observations of GRBs in the mm/submm range\n\n0.811 days\n\n1.745 days\n\n2.789 days\n\n3.774 days\n\n4.775 days\n\nN\n5\"\n\nContours=3,4,5,... mJy\n\nE\n\nFig. 2.

All these observations were performed using\nthe Large Apex BOlometer CAmera (LABOCA; Siringo et al.\n2009), a multi-channel bolometer array with 295 elements designed for continuum observations, with a field of view (FOV) of\n11.\u2032 4 \u00d7 11.\u20324 and an angular resolution of 19.5 \u00b1 1\u2032\u2032. Observations\nuntil the end of 2009 were performed using a spiral raster mapping, whereas later observations used the photometric mode. The\nmapping mode results in a fully sampled and homogeneously\ncovered map which is less sensitive than the photometric mode\n(which lacks the spatial resolution) that was made available in\n2010. We chose to use the photometric mode when it became\navailable, as we are more interested in the sensitivity than in the\nspatial coverage, as our sources are unresolved. Data reduction\nof LABOCA/APEX observations was done using BoA1 , as well\nas CRUSH and miniCRUSH (Kov\u00e1cs 2008) software packages.\nSince November 2009 we have an observing project for GRB\nafterglows from the northern hemisphere at the 8-antenna SMA\ninterferometer (Hawaii, U.S.A.) with which we have followedup 4 other bursts. Observations from SMA were reduced using\nthe MIR-IDL2 and MIRIAD (Sault et al. 1995) packages.\nIn the following, we provide details on each of our GRB observations. The data are listed, together with the complete catalogue in Table 1.\nGRB 090313: This burst was a 78 s long event with a bright\nafterglow at a redshift of z = 3.3736 (de Ugarte Postigo et al.\n2010c). After the discovery of a bright mm counterpart\n(Bock et al. 2009a), we obtained continuum observations at 345\nGHz using LABOCA/APEX bolometer array during technical\ntime. Data were acquired on 2009 March 17 and 24 under good\nweather conditions (zenith opacity values ranged from 0.24 to\n0.33 at 345 GHz). Observations were performed using a spiral\nraster mapping, providing a fully sampled and homogeneously\ncovered map in an area of diameter 12\u2032 , centered at the coordinates of the optical afterglow of GRB 090313. The total onsource integration time of the two combined epochs was 4.6 hr.\nCalibration was performed using observations of Saturn as well\nas IRAS 09452+1330, HD 82385, G10.6-0.4, and IRAS 175742403 as secondary calibrators. The absolute flux calibration uncertainty is estimated to be 11%. The telescope pointing was\nchecked every hour, finding a root mean square (r.m.s.) pointing accuracy of 1.\u2032\u2032 8. The individual maps were co-added and\nsmoothed to a final angular resolution of 27.\u2032\u2032 6. We obtained a\n3\u03c3 upper limit of 14 mJy for each of the two epochs and a limit\nof 9 mJy in the coadded maps (see Fig. 1). These data were presented, together with an analysis of the evolution of the afterglow\nemission by Melandri et al. (2010).\n1\nhttp://www.mpifr-bonn.mpg.de/div/submmtech/software/boa/\nboa main.html\n2\nhttps://www.cfa.harvard.edu/\u223ccqi/mircook.html\n\nGRB 091102: This was the first burst that we observed during our regular programme time. It was a 6.6 s long burst,\nfor which no credible optical counterpart was identified and no\nredshift was obtained. LABOCA/APEX observations were performed on 2009 November 3 under average weather conditions\n(zenith opacity values ranged from 0.4 to 0.5 at 345 GHz). The\ntotal on-source integration time was \u223c2 hr. Calibration was performed using observations of Uranus and Neptune. The absolute flux calibration uncertainty is estimated to be \u223c 8%. The\ntelescope pointing was checked every hour towards the source\nPMNJ0450-8100. We obtained a 3\u03c3 point source sensitivity of\n20 mJy.\nGRB 091127: This was a nearby burst (z = 0.49044;\nVergani et al. 2011) with a duration of 7.1 s and a bright optical counterpart that we followed with LABOCA/APEX on 2009\nNov 28 and 29 at 345 GHz. Weather conditions were average,\nwith zenith opacity values ranging from 0.4 to 0.63 at 345 GHz.\nObservations were performed using a spiral raster mapping. The\ntotal on-source integration time of the two combined epochs was\n6.4 hr (2.9 and 3.5 hr in the first and second epoch, respectively).\nPointing was checked regularly on J0050-095 and J0145-276.\nCalibration was performed using observations of Uranus and the\nsecondary calibrator NGC 2071 IR. The absolute flux calibration\nuncertainty is estimated to be about 15%. We obtained 3\u03c3 upper\nlimits of 14.9 mJy and 13.2 mJy for each of the two epochs, respectively, and 9.6 mJy for the combined epochs. An analysis of\nthe afterglow emission of this burst, including the APEX data, is\npresented by Vergani et al. (2011).\nGRB 100418A: On April, 18th 2010, the Swift Burst Alert\nTelescope (BAT) triggered and located GRB 100418A. It was\nan intermediate duration burst (7.0 s) at a redshift of z = 0.62\n(Antonelli et al. 2010). It had a peculiar optical light curve peaking several hours after the event. We performed observations of\nthe afterglow using 7 out of the 8 SMA antennas, starting \u223c 16\nhr after the burst. Weather conditions were good, with zenith\nopacities at 225 GHz of \u03c4 \u223c 0.06 (precipitable water vapour,\nPWV \u223c1 mm). Titan and Neptune were used as flux calibrators and 3C454.3 as bandpass calibrator. Atmospheric gain was\ncorrected from observations of the nearby quasar J1751+096\nevery 15 min. Using these data we discovered a bright counterpart (Martin et al. 2010) at a flux of 13.40\u00b11.60 mJy (see\nFig. 2). At the time of the discovery, this was the second\nbrightest mm/submm counterpart detected (after GRB 030329,\nwhich peaked at \u223c70 mJy; Sheth et al. 2003; Resmi et al. 2005).\nObservations continued over the following 4 nights, tracking the\nevolution of the afterglow until it became undetectable on April\n23rd (de Ugarte Postigo et al. 2012).\nGRB 100814A: This was a very long burst (150 s) with a\nbright counterpart at a redshift of z = 1.44 (O'Meara et al. 2010).\n3\n\n\fA. de Ugarte Postigo et al.: Pre-ALMA observations of GRBs in the mm/submm range\n\nContinuum observations at 345 GHz were carried out using\nLABOCA/APEX. Data were acquired on August 15 2010, starting 26 hr after the burst, under good weather conditions (zenith\nopacity value was 0.28 at 345 GHz). Observations were performed using the photometry mode. The total on-source integration time was 1.5 hr. Pointing was checked regularly on J0145276. Calibration was performed using observations of Uranus\nand the secondary calibrator V883-ORI. The absolute flux calibration uncertainty is estimated to be about 15%. The formal\nflux measured at the position of the afterglow was -0.33\u00b11.6\nmJy/beam, i.e. a 3\u03c3 limit of 4.8 mJy. A radio counterpart was\ndetected by Chandra et al. (2010) several days later from EVLA.\nGRB 100901A: This was a bright event, at a redshift of\nz=1.41 (Chornock et al. 2010). Observations were carried out\nwith SMA on the 3rd of September 2010. All eight antennas, arranged in the extended array configuration, were tuned\nto 345.8 GHz. Weather was excellent with a zenith opacity\nat 225 GHz of \u03c4 \u223c 0.06 (precipitable water vapour, PWV \u223c\n1 mm). Uranus and Callisto were observed as flux calibrators\nand 3C454.3 as bandpass. Atmospheric gain calibration was derived from the observations of the nearby quasars J0237+288\nand J0319+415 every 15 min. The GRB was observed for \u223c 10\nhr, and the observations resulted in a non detection, being the\nGRB flux constrained down to an r.m.s. noise of \u223c 0.75 mJy,\nwhich gives the deepest limit in our sample. A radio counterpart\nwas later detected by WSRT (van der Horst et al. 2010c,b) and\nEVLA (Chandra & Frail 2010).\nGRB 100925A/MAXI J1659-152: On 2010 September 25\nwe responded to a GRB alert using APEX. Observations were\nperformed 15.5 hr after the burst onset and a bright submillimeter afterglow was detected, with a flux density of 12.6\u00b12.4\nmJy (de Ugarte Postigo et al. 2010d). Later spectroscopic observations performed with the X-shooter spectrograph at the Very\nLarge Telescope, showed that the source was not due to an extragalactic GRB but to an unusually energetic burst from an X-ray\nbinary (de Ugarte Postigo et al. 2010b). Thanks to the detection\nfrom APEX, an extensive radio observation campaign was triggered (van der Horst et al. 2010a, including further observations\nfrom APEX).\nGRB 110422A: Observations of this burst at z = 1.770\n(Malesani et al. 2011; de Ugarte Postigo et al. 2011a) were carried out with the SMA on May 6th, 2011 in search for an emission tentatively detected by the Herschel Space Observatory\n(Huang et al. 2011a). The seven available antennas were tuned\nto 233.7 GHz. Weather was bad but stable enough with zenith\nopacity at 225 GHz was \u03c4 \u223c 0.35 (PWV > 5 mm). J0721+713\nwas used as flux calibrator and 3C273 as bandpass. Atmospheric\ngain calibration was derived from J0721+713 quasar observations every 15 min. The GRB was observed for 4 hr, reaching an\nr.m.s. noise of \u223c 2.8 mJy but obtained no detection.\nGRB 110503A: Observations of this z\n=\n1.613\n(de Ugarte Postigo et al. 2011b) burst were carried out with the\nSMA on May 4th, 2011. The five available antennas were tuned\nto 225.0 GHz. Weather was mediocre but stable with zenith\nopacity at 225 GHz was \u03c4 \u223c 0.25 (PWV > 4 mm). J0927+390\nwas used as flux calibrator and 3C273 as bandpass. Atmospheric\ngain calibration was derived from J0927+390 and J0920+446\nquasar observations every 15 min. The GRB was observed for 7\nhr reaching an r.m.s. noise of \u223c 1.7 mJy.\nGRB 110709B: This was a very peculiar burst, that showed\ntwo gamma-ray triggers over a period of almost 15 minutes\n(Barthelmy et al. 2011). Early optical observations showed that\nit was a very dark event (Fong & Berger 2011), with no credible\nafterglow detected or redshift measured. We performed submm\n4\n\nobservations with APEX to try to localise the counterpart and\nto constrain the synchrotron spectrum. Observations began on\nJuly 11, 2.00 days after the burst, with an on-source time of\n106 min and precipitable water vapour of 0.8 mm. We did not\ndetect any significant emission, obtaining a formal flux on the\nsource position of 1.4\u00b12.3 mJy (3-sigma limit of 6.9 mJy). A\ndetection of a radio counterpart at 5.8 GHz was later reported by\nZauderer & Berger (2011).\nGRB 110715A: This burst had a very bright optical counterpart in spite of being located very close to the plane of the\nMilky Way from which it suffered from significant dust extinction. Its redshift was measured to be z = 0.82 (Piranomonte et al.\n2011). APEX observations began on July 16, 1.42 days after\nthe burst and were performed using the photometric mode. The\nweather conditions were very good, with a precipitable water vapor of 0.62 mm. Using these observations we discovered a bright\nsubmm counterpart at 10.4\u00b12.4 mJy (de Ugarte Postigo et al.\n2011e).\nAs a test of the target of opportunity procedure,\nGRB 110715A was subsequently observed at Atacama Large\nMillimeter Array (ALMA). The ALMA Science Team report\na preliminary detection from a test observation of this source\nof 4.9\u00b10.6 mJy at 345 GHz after 25 mins on source with 7\nantennas. The centroid of the ALMA position is 15:50:44.05 46:14:06.54 with an uncertainty of 0.\u2032\u2032 3 \u00d7 0.\u2032\u2032 1 at a position angle of 76 degrees. Observations began on July 19 at 02:50 UT\n(3.57 days after the burst). The weather conditions were very\ngood, with a precipitable water vapor of 0.5 mm. In spite of being obtained during a test observation, with an order of magnitude fewer antennas than will be available with the full observatory and for only 25 minutes, this is the deepest observation in the complete sample at 345 GHz and provides the most\naccurate coordinates available for this burst. A complete analysis of the afterglow emission of this burst, will be presented by\nSanchez-Ramirez et al. (2012).\nGRB 110918A: This burst, at a redshift of z = 0.98\n(Levan et al. 2011) was one of the brightest GRBs ever detected\nin gamma-rays, and the brightest ever observed by Konus/WIND\n(Golenetskii et al. 2011). The large error box generated just with\nKonus/WIND data did not allow us to observe until 2 days after,\nwhen the coordinates were refined thanks to the detection of Xray (Mangano et al. 2011) and optical counterparts (Tanvir et al.\n2011). Continuum observations at 345 GHz were carried out\nusing LABOCA/APEX. Data were acquired on 2011-09-21 between 03:02 and 05:46 under excellent conditions (zenith opacity value was 0.2 at 345 GHz). Observations were performed\nusing the photometry mode. The total on source integration time\nwas 2.41 hours. Pointing was checked regularly on J0145-276.\nCalibration was performed using observations of Uranus and\nNeptune and and the secondary calibrator V883-ORI. The absolute flux calibration uncertainty is estimated to be about 15%.\nBecause of technical issues, the data did not reach the theoretical noise level, being no flux measured at the position of the\nafterglow and the upper 3-\u03c3 limit was 15 mJy.\n\n3. The pre-ALMA millimeter/submillimeter sample\nof GRBs\nIn order to put our observations into context, we have collected,\nin Table 1, the most complete sample of continuum observations\nthat have been published to date of GRB afterglows and their\nhost galaxies in the ALMA wavelength range, covering from\nearly 1997 until the 30th of September 2011 (starting day of\n\n\fA. de Ugarte Postigo et al.: Pre-ALMA observations of GRBs in the mm/submm range\n\nFig. 3.

The data are ordered\nchronologically by GRB, considering as detections only those\nwith higher significance than 3\u03c3, and otherwise providing detection limits. The observations are separated into ALMA bands\n3 (84 \u2013 116 GHz), 4 (125 \u2013 163 GHz), 6 (211 \u2013 275 GHz), 7 (275\n\u2013 373 GHz) and 9 (602 \u2013 720 GHz). See Table 2 for a definition\nof all the ALMA bands3 , which we will use throughout the paper for simplicity. The complete sample includes observations\nof 102 bursts. There have been 88 searches for GRB afterglows,\nof which 22 have reports of detections. Separating into individual bands, we have 18 detections in band 3, one in band 4, six\nin band 6, five in band 7 and none in band 9. Table 3 displays\na list of the detection ratios for each of the observing bands.\nAs for the host galaxies, there have been specific host galaxy\nsearches for 36 cases, although limits can be provided for the\n3\n\nAdapted from http://www.almaobservatory.org\n\nFig. 4.

Host galaxy detections have\nonly been achieved in four cases: GRB 000210, GRB 000418,\nGRB 010222 and XT 080109, this last one cannot be considered\na normal GRB as the burst was in X-rays and not in gamma\n(Soderberg et al. 2008). There have been further claims of host\ndetections but we consider only those with signal to noise ratio\ngreater than 3.\nFigure 3 shows a compilation of the mm/submm GRB afterglow light curves for ALMA bands 3, 6 and 7. Figure 4 shows\nhistograms of the peak detections and detection limits. The peak\ndetections are, strictly speaking, only lower limits to the peak\nflux density in each band, as only a few light curves cover the\nmaximum of the light curve. The detection limits are the singleepoch deepest 3\u03c3 limits for each burst, independently of the time\nof the observation, so they can only be indicative of the capabilities of pre-ALMA observatories.\nThe afterglow peak flux for each observing band in the\nmm/submm range is expected to be very similar, with only the\ntime at which the peak is reached being different. According to\nthe fireball model (Sari et al. 1998, see aslo Sect. 3.1), the peak\n5\n\n\fA. de Ugarte Postigo et al.: Pre-ALMA observations of GRBs in the mm/submm range\n\nTable 2.

The physics of GRBs and their environments\n\nGRB afterglows can be described, in the simplest case, using the\nfireball model (Sari et al. 1998). According to this model, material is ejected at ultrarelativistic velocities through collimated\njets (with opening angle \u03b8 j ). When this material interacts with\nthe medium surrounding the progenitor, the accelerated particles\nemit a synchrotron spectrum that is characterised by three break\nfrequencies: \u03bdm is the characteristic synchrotron frequency and is\nthe maximum of the emission; \u03bdc is the cooling frequency, above\n6\n\nFig. 6.

The physical parameters of the\nfireball are the following: E = 1053 erg s\u22121 , n=0.1cm\u22123, \u01ebB =0.01,\n\u01ebe =0.088, p=2.1 and \u03b8 j =5 deg. The light curves are characterised by a shallow rise during the first hours to days after the\nburst followed by a decay, as seen in most of the light curves\nof Fig. 3, when there are enough data points. The figure also\nshows how the peak is reached later at lower frequencies for a\ngiven redshift, while it is delayed for high redshift events due to\ncosmological time dilation.\nA reverse shock, produced inside the ejecta, can produce additional emission at early times (Piran 1999). This\nemission has been rarely observed in the optical wavelengths\n(e.g. Akerlof et al. 1999; Blake et al. 2005; Jel\u0131\u0301nek et al. 2006;\nRacusin et al. 2008; Zheng et al. 2011) but is expected to\nhave a significant contribution in the early mm/submm emission (Inoue et al. 2007). For example, the mm detection of\nGRB 090423, at a redshift of 8.2, seems to show excess emission possibly due to a reverse shock (Castro-Tirado et al. 2009b;\nChandra et al. 2010).\nThis model is, however, known to be too simplistic to\nexplain the complex evolution that we can see in the densely\nsampled X-ray and optical light curves of Swift GRBs.\nSeveral modifications have been suggested to explain some\nof the observed fluctuations, flares, bumps and wiggles.\nSuch modifications may include different density profiles\nand fluctuations (Wang & Loeb 2000; Ramirez-Ruiz et al.\n2001; Dai & Lu 2002; Nakar & Piran 2003), energy injections\n(Rees & Meszaros 1998; Sari & M\u00e9sz\u00e1ros 2000; Granot et al.\n2003; Bj\u00f6rnsson et al. 2004; J\u00f3hannesson et al. 2006), jets\nwith complex structure (M\u00e9sz\u00e1ros et al. 1998; Kumar & Piran\n2000; Rossi et al. 2002), late engine activity (Dai & Lu\n1998; Zhang & M\u00e9sz\u00e1ros 2002; Ramirez-Ruiz 2004), microlensing (Loeb & Perna 1998; Garnavich et al. 2000;\nIoka & Nakamura 2001) or dust echoes (Esin & Blandford\n2000; M\u00e9sz\u00e1ros & Gruzinov 2000; Reichart 2001). Discerning\nthe different scenarios is only possible through the analysis of\nthe SEDs obtained with multi-wavelength observations (See\nSect. 4) and, in some cases, with the aid of polarimetry.\n3.2. Redshift distribution and luminosities\n\nIn spite of the strong limitation imposed by the detection limits of current observatories, the sample includes detections of\nGRBs at most redshifts, ranging from z=0.168 (GRB 030329\nGreiner et al. 2003) all the way up to z=8.2 (GRB 090423\nTanvir et al. 2009; Salvaterra et al. 2009). XT 080109 at a redshift of 0.0065 (Malesani et al. 2008) had no gamma-ray emission, so we will exclude it from the analysis. This shows that\nGRBs can be great tools to study the evolution of the star formation across the complete history of the Universe also in this\nfrequency range. Figure 7 shows the distribution of the redshifts\nof GRBs detected in the mm/submm range as compared to the\ndistribution obtained from optical observations (Jakobsson et al.\n2012). The mm/submm sample has a larger percentage of low\nredshift detections but, on the other hand, the average redshift\nwas compensated by deep searches of the high redshift events.\nWe note that the optical sample has its own biases, for example the limited capability to detect dark bursts (see Sect. 4.1 for\na definition of dark burst). A Kolmogorov-Smirnov test gives a\nprobability of 11% for both mm/submm detected bursts and the\nSwift sample of GRBs with redshift of coming from the same\npopulation. We obtain a median (mean) redshift for our sample\nof detections of 1.48 (1.99), as compared to 1.92 (2.19) of the\nsample of Swift bursts (Jakobsson et al. 2012).\n\nFig. 7. The cumulative fraction of GRBs as a function of redshift for the optical sample of Swift GRBs (dotted curve;\nJakobsson et al. 2012) and mm/submm-detected bursts (solid\ncurve).\n\nFig. 8. Peak flux density measured in mm/submm (as in Fig.4)\nvs. redshift. Filled dots indicate detections whereas empty triangles are detection limits. The dotted lines indicate the flux\ndensity levels for equal luminosity objects at varying redshifts.\nSome interesting bursts are indicated in the figure.\nIn Fig. 8 we show the peak flux density measured in the\nmm/submm range as a function of the redshift. The dotted lines\nindicate the expected flux at different redshifts for objects of\nequal peak luminosities. The figure shows that the brightest burst\never detected, GRB 030329 (Hjorth et al. 2003; Stanek et al.\n2003; Lipkin et al. 2004; Sheth et al. 2003; Resmi et al. 2005), is\nmainly so due to its low redshift. GRB 090423, the furthermost\ndetected in mm/submm, at a redshift of z = 8.2 (Salvaterra et al.\n2009; Tanvir et al. 2009), was not extremely luminous, and was\nonly detected thanks to very deep observations (it is, in fact,\nthe deepest detection in the sample; Castro-Tirado et al. 2012).\nGRB 080319B, also known as the \"naked-eye burst\" due to\nits extreme optical brightness (Racusin et al. 2008; Bloom et al.\n2009; Pandey et al. 2009) is found in the faint end of the distribution, indicating that most of the emission was concentrated in\nthe optical bands.\nOn the upper part of the diagram, we identify a family\nof very luminous events, peaking at \u223c 1033 erg s\u22121 Hz\u22121 ,\ncomposed by GRB 980329 (Smith et al. 1999; Jaunsen et al.\n2003), GRB 050904 (Tagliaferri et al. 2005; Haislip et al.\n7\n\n\fA. de Ugarte Postigo et al.: Pre-ALMA observations of GRBs in the mm/submm range\n\n2006), GRB 080129 (Greiner et al. 2009) and GRB 090313\n(Melandri et al. 2010), all beyond redshift 3. If those bursts\nwere to be found at redshift of \u223c 1 they would reach peak fluxes\nof 40 mJy and easily over 100 mJy at redshifts of \u223c 0.5.\nOn the fainter side, GRB 060218 (z = 0.03) is be the burst\nfor which we would have the most constraining peak luminosity limits. However, this burst is known to be peculiar, being its\noptical emission dominated by a supernova component and not\nthe afterglow (Campana et al. 2006; Soderberg et al. 2006; see\nalso Th\u00f6ne et al. 2011). GRB 050509B an extremely faint short\nburst, most probably hosted by a giant elliptical galaxy at z =\n0.22 (Hjorth et al. 2005; Gehrels et al. 2005; Castro-Tirado et al.\n2005) is the following dimmest limit. The least luminous burst\nwith detection in the mm/submm range is GRB 041219A, which\ncuriously was one of the longest and brightest GRBs detected,\nfor which a redshift of z = 0.31 has been recently suggested\n(G\u00f6tz et al. 2011).\nIn the figure we also identify GRB 100418A and\nGRB 110715A, whose counterparts were discovered with\nour programmes. They are the 3rd and 4th brightest bursts ever\ndetected in the mm/submm bands.\nUsing all the detections, we obtain an average peak spectral\nluminosity of 10(32.1\u00b10.7) erg s\u22121 Hz\u22121 . This is roughly an order\nof magnitude brighter than the value found by Chandra & Frail\n(2011) in cm wavelengths, as expected by afterglow models.\nHowever, we note that these values must be used with care, as\nboth samples strongly biased due to a low detection rate (25% in\nour case and 30% in the case of the cm range study).\n\nwhereas in Fig. 9 they are both normal luminosity bursts. On\nthe other hand, the light curves appear to be reasonably well described by the expectations of the theory described in Sect. 3.1,\nreaching a maximum between a few hours and a few days and\nthen decaying.\n3.3. Estimation of the peak flux density distribution\n\nWe can try to make a rough estimate of the distribution of peak\nflux densities using the data from our sample and information extrapolated from other spectral ranges. We assume that the peak\nflux density of GRB afterglows can be described by a gaussian\nfunction in the logarithmic space as is seen for the flux density\nat specific times in other wavelengths. This gaussian can be normalised using the fact that in band 3 we are detecting 30% of\nthe afterglows down to a limit of \u223c 0.9mJy. The largest uncertainty here comes from the dispersion of the gaussian. Using the\ncomplete catalogue of data from Kann et al. (2010) we find that\nthe dispersion in the brightness of observed optical R-band magnitudes, corrected of extinction, at a specific time (1.0 days) is\nof 0.49, whereas for the X-rays, using the data from the burst\nanalyser (Evans et al. 2010) find a dispersion of 0.56. Both values are quite similar, however, as the X-ray constitutes a more\ncomplete sample we will use this estimate. We must also consider that the sample of mm/submm follow-up mainly includes\nbrighter bursts. If we calculate the average X-ray flux densities at\none day of all the GRBs in the Swift sample and compare it with\nthe subsample of the ones that were followed in mm/submm we\nfind that the one first is dimmer by a factor of 1.7, which we apply to the average of the estimated distribution in mm/submm.\nFigure 10 shows a histogram with the detections and detection\nlimits of all bands combined, together with the distribution of\npeak fluxes that has been estimated here, with an average of 0.3\nmJy. Using these values we estimate that ALMA should be able\nto detect, using band 3, 87 % of all the afterglows already in its\nearly configuration with 16 antennas, and 98 % in its full setup\nof 66. Using band 6, the values would be 72 % (early) and 94 %\n(full), and in band 7, 50 % (early) and 82 % (full).\n\nFig. 9. Afterglow light curves transformed to the rest frame of\nthe central engine. The data points of the different bands have\nbeen shifted using an offset based on the fireball model, as explained in the text.\nFinally, we collect the light curves of GRBs with at least 2\ndetections and a well determined redshift, and transform them to\nthe rest frame of the central engine to compare them directly. In\nFig. 9 we plot the light curves (only detections) in luminosity and\ncorrected of cosmological time dilation. To be able to use all the\nbands together, we introduce a temporal offset assuming that the\nlight curves are described by a fireball model in which the peak\nfrequency is evolving with t\u22123/2 (see Sect. 3.1). This is a simplistic approach but enough for a qualitative view. The intrinsic\nlight curves appear much more clustered than the observed ones\nin Fig. 3 where the dispersion in fluxes was mostly due to redshift: The brightest light curve was from GRB 030329, the nearest burst and the faintest from GRB 090423, the furthest one,\n8\n\nFig. 10. Histogram showing the detections and detection limits\nof all the bands combined and an estimate of the real peak flux\ndensity distribution (indicated with a thick trace), compared to\nthe detection limits of ALMA (from Table 5). The dashed-dotted\ngaussian is the distribution derived from our sample, before correcting for the selection bias, as explained in the text.\n\n\fA. de Ugarte Postigo et al.: Pre-ALMA observations of GRBs in the mm/submm range\n\n3.4. Comparison with X-ray flux densities\n\nThanks to the X-Ray Telescope (XRT; Burrows et al. 2005) onboard Swift, nowadays we have early X-ray detections of the vast\nmajority of GRB afterglows within the first minutes after the\nburst. These observations give us not only a precise position of\nthe afterglow, but also a spectrum from which we can derive the\nunextinguished flux density, the spectral slope and the extinction due to metals in the line of sight. All this information can\nbe used to estimate the expected flux in other wavelengths on a\ncase to case basis assuming a synchrotron model as described in\nSect. 3.1.\nIn this section we make a general comparison of the flux\ndensities measured in the X-ray and mm/submm bands for those\nbursts that were observed by Swift. For the X-rays, we use the\nflux densities measured 0.5 days after the burst (when we can assume that the emission is dominated by the afterglow) at 10 keV\n(Evans et al. 2010). The scarce and heterogenous mm/submm\ncoverage does not allow us to obtain a sample of flux densities\nat a given epoch. In consequence, we use, as an approximation\nthe peak flux densities, as explained in Sect. 3. The two quantities are plotted in Fig. 11, where we can see, as expected, a\ncorrelation between the flux density measured in X-rays and in\nmm/submm, although with a significant dispersion.\n\nFig. 11. Comparison of the peak flux density measured in\nmm/submm with the X-ray flux density 0.5 days after the burst\n(at 10keV). Filled dots indicate detections, whereas empty triangles are 3\u03c3 detection limits. Dashed lines indicate some characteristic slopes of the fireball model. The dotted line is the average\nobserved in the sample of detections and the dashed-dotted line\nis an estimation of the real average.\nEvans et al. (2009) found that the typical spectral slope measured in X-rays was, on average \u03b2X \u223c \u22121.0 (where F\u03bd \u221d \u03bd\u03b2 ),\nwhich would be the slope expected for an electron index of\np = 2.0 if X-rays were above the cooling break (\u03bdc ). The extrapolation of the X-ray measurement to mm/submm using this\nslope would give us the maximum flux that we could expect to\nmeasure for a synchrotron spectrum and is indicated in the figure by the upper dashed line. As expected, there is no GRB that\nhas been measured above this extrapolation. On the other side,\nif \u03bdc was just below X-rays, the lowest extrapolated flux would\nbe obtained using a spectral index of \u03b2 = \u22120.5, also indicated in\nthe figure. This is what Jakobsson et al. (2004) used to define the\nlimit for dark bursts (see Sect. 4.1). In the case of mm/submm,\ndue to the lack of extinction or due to dust or high redshift,\n\nwe would only expect to find below this threshold those bursts\nwhere \u03bdm would be above the mm/submm range. In Fig. 11 we\ncan see that all our detected bursts are located between these\ntwo limits, and mostly clustered around \u03b2 = \u22120.75. On the other\nhand, the average flux density derived from X-rays 0.5 days after the burst (derived in a similar way as we did for 1 day in\nSect. 3.3) at 10keV is 1.04 \u00d7 10\u22125 mJy, whereas we estimated at\ntypical peak flux density of 0.3 mJy. This would imply a typical\n\u03b2mm\u2212X =0.65, slightly lower than the typical value for detected\nbursts, as expected due to the abundant detection limits.\n\n4. GRBs in the ALMA era\nAs shown in Figs. 3 and 4, until now the mm/submm observations of GRBs have been limited by the low sensitivity of the observations in this range as compared to other wavelengths. This\nis changing with the start of operations of the ALMA observatory. Even in its early configuration, ALMA will outperform the\nsensitivity of all previous observatories. Table 5 shows a comparison of the sensitivities (assuming equal observing conditions) of\nsome of the current mm/submm observatories with ALMA, both\nin its early and final configuration. In its final setup, the sensitivities will improve between 1 and 2 orders of magnitude. If\nwe consider that the atmospheric conditions at the ALMA site\nare commonly better than the average of other observatories, the\ndifference will be even more significant.\nHowever, it will not only be the sensitivity, but also the spatial resolution that will allow ALMA to make breakthroughs in\nGRB studies. In its extended configuration, ALMA in its full\narray capabilities will allow resolutions of 0.050\u2032\u2032 in band 3 or\n0.013\u2032\u2032 in band 7 (4.8\u2032\u2032 and 1.7\u2032\u2032 , respectively, in the most compact configuration), allowing precise localisation of the afterglows and detailed studies of the host galaxies.\nThe observation of GRB 110715A that we present here, obtained during the commissioning phase of ALMA, is an advance\nof what this observatory will be capable of. Already the commissioning phase it was proved that ALMA can reliably perform\nToO observations. Furthermore, with only 25 minutes on target,\nit obtained the deepest observation of a GRB in the 345 GHz\nband to date and allowed us to derive the most precise coordinates that are available for this afterglow.\n4.1. GRB afterglows\n\nALMA observations will play a significant role in understanding the physics of GRBs and their environment. The increased\nsensitivity will allow us to probe almost complete samples of afterglows, not just limited to the brightest events as we do now,\neliminating most of the observational biases. In the case of very\nbright events ALMA will allow us to attempt, for the first time,\nstudies of absorption spectral features, from which we will be\nable to derive the molecular content of distant galaxies and the\nchemical enrichment of the interstellar medium along the history\nof the Universe.\nThanks to its large collecting area, ALMA will also be able\nto provide polarimetric measurements for a sample or relatively\nbright events. As shown by Toma et al. (2008), this can give\na unique view on some fundamental physics of shockwaves\n(though ALMA polarimetric calibration is unlikely to get better\nthan \u223c 1 percent). Furthermore, simple linear polarisation measurements in submm and optical, will tell us about the plasma\nproperties in the forward shock and the geometry of the ejecta.\nOne of the key areas where ALMA will play an important\nrole will be the study of dark bursts, which strongly bias the op9\n\n\fA. de Ugarte Postigo et al.: Pre-ALMA observations of GRBs in the mm/submm range\n\nTable 5.

SED of the afterglow of the dark GRB 051022. Filled\ndots mark detections while empty dots and arrow mark detection limits. In blue we draw a synchrotron spectrum that can explain the radio and X-ray emission, while the optical/nIR data\n(1014\u221215 Hz) lie well bellow. Adding a Small Magellanic Cloud\n(SMC) extinction of AV \u223c 15 results in a SED (red dotted line)\nconsistent with all the data (data obtained from Cameron & Frail\n2005; Bremer et al. 2005; Castro-Tirado et al. 2007).\ntically selected samples of GRBs (see for example Fynbo et al.\n2009). Dark bursts are those that are less luminous in the optical than what we would expect them to be assuming a synchrotron spectrum as the one explained in Sect. 3.1 based on the\nextrapolation of X-ray observations. Jakobsson et al. (2004) define them assuming that the electron index is p > 2 (Sari et al.\n1998), and that \u03bdm is below optical frequencies (as is normally\nthe case). Under this assumption, we would never expect a\nsynchrotron spectrum with a slope between optical and X-rays\n\u03b2OX > \u22120.5 (note that in this paper we use the convention\nF\u03bd \u221d \u03bd\u03b2 as in Sari et al. 1998, \u03b2 having opposite sign to the one\nused by Jakobsson et al. 2004). This definition was extended by\nvan der Horst et al. (2009) not limiting the value of p and, instead, requiring \u03b2OX > \u03b2X + 0.5 (being \u03b2X the spectral slope\n10\n\nFig. 13. SED of GRB 050904 at redshift z = 6.29 (Kawai et al.\n2006) using the detection from PdBI 5.896 days after the burst\n(Castro-Tirado et al. 2012). The X-ray flux is estimated from the\nXRT light curve, the radio data are from Frail et al. (2006), while\noptical/NIR are extrapolations from Tagliaferri et al. (2005);\nHaislip et al. (2006). For the rough synchrotron spectrum drawn\nin blue, we have assumed an electron energy distribution index of p = 2.30, while an SMC extinction with AV = 0.12\n(consistent with the value derived by Stratta et al. 2011; but see\nalso Zafar et al. 2010) and Lyman blanketing (Madau 1995) have\nbeen considered in the red dotted line to match the optical/NIR\nobservations.

This reduced optical emission can be\ndue to optical extinction by dust, a high-redshift event (where\nthe Lyman break is beyond the optical, at z & 5) or a deviation\nfrom the simple synchrotron spectrum (like an additional inverse\nCompton component or a distribution of the emitting electrons\nnot described by a single power law). Below we give an example\nof each of the two main families of dark bursts.\n\n\fA. de Ugarte Postigo et al.: Pre-ALMA observations of GRBs in the mm/submm range\n\nFig. 14. Spectral lines observable at each ALMA band as a function of the redshift. Different colours have been used to indicate\ndifferent elements.\nOptically selected samples of GRBs are limited by the\namount of extinction in the host galaxy that, if large, can attenuate the optical emission and make it undetectable. Hence,\nthere is a strong bias against high extinction bursts, which limits\nour capability to study the star forming regions where GRBs are\nproduced. However, the negligible effect of dust extinction in the\nmm/submm range allows us to detect afterglows independently\nof this effect, and consequently study a more complete sample. As an example of highly extinguished burst, we can look at\nthe case of GRB 051022, with \u03b2OX > 0.05 (Castro-Tirado et al.\n2007; Rol et al. 2007) one of the darkest bursts detected to date,\nfor which an optical counterpart was not found. Precise location was obtained thanks to mm observations (Cameron & Frail\n2005; Bremer et al. 2005; Castro-Tirado et al. 2007), which allowed identification of the host galaxy, for which a redshift of\nz = 0.8 was derived (Castro-Tirado et al. 2007). A broadband\nstudy allows us to impose a lower limit on the host galaxy extinction of AV > 15 (see Fig. 12, and for other estimates also\nCastro-Tirado et al. 2007; Rol et al. 2007), far beyond what is\ntypically seen in optically selected GRB afterglows.\nThe other main cause for optically dark GRBs is a high\nredshift. In these cases the absorption produced at frequencies\nhigher than the Lyman limit does not allow us to obtain optical detections (in R-band) of GRB afterglows beyond redshifts\nof 6. These events are important to understand the formation of\nthe first stars in the Universe. Proof that they can be detected in\nthe mm/submm range is the fact that already in the pre-ALMA\nera, out of the three GRB afterglows observed at z > 6, two\nhave been detected (GRB 050904 at z = 6.3 and GRB 090423 at\nz = 8.2). In Fig. 13 we have drawn the SED of GRB 050904\nat z = 6.3, including radio limits (Frail et al. 2006), a detection in band 3 (and a limit in band 6) from Plateau de Bure\n\nInterferometer (Castro-Tirado et al. 2012), near-infrared and optical data (Tagliaferri et al. 2005; Haislip et al. 2006) and X-ray\ndata from Swift. In spite of its high redshift, this burst was detected with a peak flux density of 1.47 mJy in band 3, 80 times\nabove ALMA's detection threshold for 1 hr of observations in\nband 3. In the case of bright events it has been suggested that\nthe study of the HD deuterium-molecule rotational-transition in\nabsorption at 112 \u03bcm could give us important clues on the formation of population III stars at very high redshift (Inoue et al.\n2007). CO absorption lines, which have been already reported\nthrough optical spectroscopy of the afterglow of GRB 080607\n(Prochaska et al. 2009; Sheffer et al. 2009) are also good candidates to produce absorption features in the mm/submm range.\n4.2. GRB host galaxies with ALMA\n\nUp to now the majority of GRB hosts has not been detected at\nmm/submm wavelengths (Tanvir et al. 2004; Berger et al. 2003;\nPriddey et al. 2006a; Watson et al. 2011) even when dark GRBs\n(which are supposed to be dusty) were targeted (Barnard et al.\n2003). This was interpreted as an indication that they are not\nheavily dust-obscured. Except for the host of the local GRB\n980425 (Micha\u0142owski et al. in preparation), only three z \u223c\n1 GRB hosts (GRB 000210, GRB 000418 and GRB 010222)\nwere detected at mm and submm wavelengths (Frail et al. 2002;\nBerger et al. 2003; Tanvir et al. 2004). Their derived dust masses\nof a few times 108 M\u2299 (Micha\u0142owski et al. 2008) are comparable to that of z \u223c 2 \u2013 3 dusty starbursts known as submm\ngalaxies (Kov\u00e1cs et al. 2006; Micha\u0142owski et al. 2010). Despite\nthese significant amounts of dust, these GRB hosts exhibit properties consistent with the rest of the GRB host population,\nnamely blue optical colours, low extinction and low optical star\n11\n\n\fA. de Ugarte Postigo et al.: Pre-ALMA observations of GRBs in the mm/submm range\n\nformation rates (Gorosabel et al. 2003a,b; Galama et al. 2003;\nBerger et al. 2003; Savaglio et al. 2003, 2009; Christensen et al.\n2004; Castro Cer\u00f3n et al. 2006, 2010; Kann et al. 2006). This\ndiscrepancy was explained by Micha\u0142owski et al. (2008) by invoking very young stellar population with optical emission completely extinguished by dust. This indicates that it is virtually\nimpossible to predict the dust emission of GRB hosts based on\ntheir optical properties and advocates for the use of ALMA to\ntarget a significant and unbiased sample of these galaxies.\nDespite numerous attempts, CO emission has not been detected for any GRB host galaxy (Kohno et al. 2005; Endo et al.\n2007; Hatsukade et al. 2007, 2011; Stanway et al. 2011); we refer to Table 1 in Hatsukade et al. (2011) for a homogeneous\noverview of all available limits on CO line luminosities of GRB\nhosts. The derived upper limits on molecular gas masses of 108\n\u2013 109 M\u2299 indicate that GRB hosts are not as gas-rich as submm\ngalaxies (Greve et al. 2005; Ivison et al. 2011).\nWe further note that the recent discovery of strong CO\nand H2 features in absorption in an optical spectrum of the\nafterglow of GRB 080607 (Prochaska et al. 2009; Sheffer et al.\n2009) highlights the value of ALMA molecular line observations\nin tandem with optical spectroscopy. The detection of vibrationally excited transitions (H\u22172 ) in the afterglow of GRB 080607\n(Sheffer et al. 2009), likely excited by the UV flux of the afterglow, show the importance of repeated spectroscopic observations by ALMA to probe the ISM properties of the host galaxies\nthrough time variable lines.\nThe unprecedented sensitivity of ALMA in the mm and submm wavelengths, will allow the study of GRB host galaxies\nthrough both continuum and emission line observations. ALMA\nis sensitive enough to probe the dust properties of representative GRB hosts, not only the most star-forming ones. Moreover,\nthe excellent angular resolution of ALMA will allow spatiallyresolved studies of these galaxies. This is important as there\nare indications that the immediate environments (1 \u2013 3 kpc) of\nGRBs are the most star-forming sites within their host galaxies (Bloom et al. 2002; Fruchter et al. 2006; Th\u00f6ne et al. 2008;\n\u00d6stlin et al. 2008; Micha\u0142owski et al. 2009).\nTo date, measured spectroscopic GRB redshifts range between 0.0085 and 8.2. Figure 14 shows a number of spectral\nfeatures that will be covered by the different ALMA bands\nfor a range of redshifts between z = 0 up to z = 10.\nTaking into account the weather constraints at the highest\nbands, we consider that bands 3 to 7 will be better suited\nfor host detections. For the nearer events (z . 4) the carbon monoxide ladder of rotational transitions up to J = 11 \u2013\n10 could be feasible as reported for the submillimeter galaxy\nSMM J16359+6612 (at z = 2.52; Weiss et al. 2005b) and the\nbroad absorption line quasar APM08279+5255 (at z = 3.87;\nWeiss et al. 2007). Additionally, the fine structure transitions of\nneutral carbon at 492 and 809 GHz were also detected towards APM08279+5255 (Weiss et al. 2005a; Wagg et al. 2006).\nMoreover, [CI] at 809 GHz and CO J = 7 \u2013 6, separated\n\u223c 2.4 GHz in the rest frame, could be observed simultaneously\nfor redshifts of z \u223c 2 \u2013 8 provided the large bandwidth of ALMA\nreceivers. At redshifts above z = 4 \u2013 5, the higher-J CO transitions will still be visible mostly within bands 3 to 5. Above that\nredshift, the fine structure lines of the most abundant elements,\nO, C, and N, will be the best suited ISM tracers. In particular the\nfine structure line of [CII] at 158 \u03bcm is likely the brightest emission line observable at high-z (Maiolino et al. 2009). The lines\nof [OIII] at 52 \u03bcm and 88 \u03bcm and [OI] at 63 \u03bcm have also been\nreported towards high-redshift lensed systems (Ferkinhoff et al.\n2010; Sturm et al. 2010).\n12\n\n5. Conclusions\nThis paper presents the most complete catalogue of GRB observations in the mm/submm range to date, including observations\nof 11 GRBs from our programmes at APEX and SMA. We include a short observation of a GRB obtained with the ALMA\nobservatory during its commissioning phase and with only 7 antennas, that gives an early idea of the potential of the observatory.\nThe total sample contains data from 102 GRBs. Among this collection of observations, there are 88 observations of GRB afterglows, of which 22 (25%) were detected (two of them discovered\nwithin our programmes) and 35 of host galaxies, of which 4 were\ndetected. Observations until now have been strongly limited by\nthe sensitivity of the instruments in this range, imposing important biases to any statistical study performed with them. Even\nwith these limitations, we have proved that it is already possible to detect counterparts to GRBs in the mm/submm range with\nredshifts ranging from 0.168 all the way up to 8.2. This spectral\nrange has also proved to be a very useful tool to localise and\ncharacterise the counterparts of dark GRBs, which are elusive in\noptical wavelengths.\nWithin the sample bursts have peak luminosities spanning\nover 2.5 orders of magnitude, with the most luminous reaching\n1033 erg s\u22121 Hz\u22121 . If such a burst happened at redshift of \u223c 1 they\nwould reach peak fluxes of 40 mJy and over 100 mJy at redshifts\nof \u223c 0.5. Comparing with X-rays, we find a correlation of the\npeak flux density in mm/submm with the X-ray flux density at\n0.5 days that can serve to make rough predictions of mm/submm\nbrightness from the early X-ray data. Using data from the sample\nand assumptions based on samples at other wavelengths, an estimate of the real peak flux density distribution of GRBs is made,\nfrom which an average peak flux density value of 0.33 mJy can\nbe expected.\nOn the 30th September 2011, the ALMA observatory started\nscientific operations with a limited setup of 16 antennas. Already\nthen, it became the most sensitive observatory in the mm/submm\nrange, increasing the sensitivity and resolution by around an order of magnitude with respect to the previous instrumentation,\nbeing even more significant in the highest frequencies. The final full observatory, with 66 antennas will set completely new\nstandards in the field. In addition to the improved sensitivity and\nresolution, ALMA will be capable of observing in a very wide\nrange of frequencies, that was never covered before by a single observatory. Using our peak flux density estimates and the\ndetection limits calculated for ALMA, we can expect that early\nALMA will detect around 87 % of the bursts, while full ALMA\nshould be able to detect 98 %. In the case of bright GRB afterglows, like GRB 030329, GRB 100621A, GRB 100418A or\nGRB 110715A, where fluxes reached tens of mJy, ALMA will\nbe able to study spectral features and perform polarimetric studies of the afterglow, which have been out of reach until now.\nWith ALMA we will be, for the first time, in position to undertake studies of samples of GRB host galaxies. We will be able\nto perform studies of the continuum emission to characterise the\ndust content and determine the unextinguished star formation\nrate of the hosts. Through the study of emission features from\nthe host, we will be able to understand the molecular content\nand the chemical enrichment of the strong star-forming regions\nin which GRBs are found, at redshifts that go back to the epoch\nin which the first stars were formed.\nAcknowledgements.

Pre-ALMA observations of GRBs in the millimeter and submillimeter range. Epochs are given as mid-observing time since the GRB\nonset (t \u2212 t0 ) or the closest value available. Errors are 1\u03c3, while upper limits are 3\u03c3. Whenever possible we specify the formal measured flux at\nthe position of the afterglow for detection limits in brackets, when not available we have written 0.00. For observations performed more than 6\nmonths from the burst, obtained to look for the host and not for the afterglow, we do not give the epoch and just mark them as
