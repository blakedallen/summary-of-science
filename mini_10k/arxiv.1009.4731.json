In the case of metals the different quasi-particles may be the up and down spin\nbands in an external magnetic field or bands arising from distinct atomic orbitals that coexist at\na common Fermi surface. These systems present a complex phase diagram as a function of the\ndifference between the Fermi wave-vectors of the different bands. This can be controlled by external\nmeans, varying the density in the two-component cold atom system or, in a metal, by applying an\nexternal magnetic field or pressure. Here we study the zero temperature instability of the normal\nsystem as the Fermi wave-vectors mismatch of the quasi-particles (bands) is reduced and find a\nsecond order quantum phase transition to a PDW superconducting state. From the nature of the\nquantum critical fluctuations close to the superconducting quantum critical point (SQCP), we obtain\nits dynamic critical exponent. It turns out to be z = 2 and this allows to fully characterize the\nSQCP for dimensions d \u2265 2.\n\nIn strongly correlated materials superconductivity can\nbe suppressed in different ways. Most commonly, this\nis accomplished by an external magnetic field, applied\npressure or doping1\u20137 . However, the point in the phase\ndiagram where the critical temperature Tc vanishes as\na function of the external parameters is not necessarily\nassociated with a SQCP. In the case of superconductivity induced by antiferromagnetic fluctuations due to the\nproximity of an antiferromagnetic quantum critical point\n(AFQCP)8 , as the system moves away from the AFQCP,\nthese fluctuations change from attractive to repulsive and\nsuperconductivity just fades away9.\nInter-band superconductivity is a long standing problem in condensed matter physics10,11 . It can be realized, for example, by applying an external magnetic field\nin a metallic system. The field splits the band and the\nphase diagram as a function of the mismatch of the Fermi\nwave-vectors of the up and down spin bands can be investigated. It also occurs for the case of superconductivity mediated by valence fluctuations, where the most\nrelevant correlations are due to inter-band pairing12 .\nIn multi-band metals, pressure can be used to change\nthe hybridization and the mismatch of the Fermi wavevectors of the different bands coexisting at the common\nFermi surface13 . More recently this problem has received\nmuch attention due to the possibility of investigating it\nin cold atom systems. In this case the attractive interaction between two fermionic systems with different Fermi\nwave-vectors can be tuned by Feshbach resonance14. The\nFermi wave-vector mismatch \u03b4kF in this case is controlled by varying the density of the atoms and this allows the phase diagram to be fully explored. In the core\nof neutron stars, up an down quarks, in different numbers, with attractive interactions may give rise to color\ninter-band superconductivity13,14 . We neglect here orbital effects. Whenever a magnetic field is mentioned, it\nis to be considered as an external agent whose only effect\n\nis to produce the mismatch of the Fermi wave-vectors.\nWhile avoiding complications related to the vortices15 ,\nthe present approach is relevant for many interesting\nproblems14 as pointed out above.\nThe zero temperature phase diagram for inter-band superconductors with s-wave pairing has been established\nusing mean-field calculations11 . As the Fermi wavevector mismatch increases, there is a first order phase\ntransition from a BCS-like state to an FFLO or PDW\nstate. As the mismatch further increases there is a continuous transition to a normal metallic phase11 . As new\nsystems are discovered and the possibility of finding experimentally new exotic PDW phases increases, it is important to fully understand the nature of the normal to\nPDW transition beyond the mean-field approximation.\nHere we investigate this transition using a new approach.\nIt is based on a perturbation theory for retarded and advanced Green's functions16 . We relate the appearance of\nsuperconductivity in the multi-band system to the divergence of a generalized susceptibility17 \u03c7(q, \u03c9), like in the\nStoner criterion for ferromagnetism.\nWe start in the normal phase and calculate the response of the system to a frequency and wave-vector\ndependent fictitious external field which couples to the\nsuperconducting order parameter18. For simplicity we\nconsider here the case of s-wave superconductivity.\nIn our approach, at the level of the RPA approximation\npresented here, we have to calculate only single-particle\nGreen's functions. This is different and simpler than the\nusual linear response theory, which relates the response\nof the system to two-particles Green's functions19 .\nAt zero temperature, as the Fermi wave-vectors mismatch is reduced, we find a divergence of the static part\nof the susceptibility at a finite wave-vector q = q0 . This\noccurs at the critical mean-field value of the mismatch\nwhich destroys pair density wave superconductivity. This\ndivergence implies that even in zero field the system can\n\n\f2\nhave a finite inhomogeneous superconducting order parameter. The condition for the superconducting instability can be expressed in the form of a Stoner-like criterion,\n1 \u2212 U \u03c70 (q = q0 , \u03b4kF ) = 0. This determines either a critical value of the attractive interaction Uc above which\nthe system is superconductor or a critical mismatch below which superconductivity sets in. The coupling of\nthe order parameter to the electronic degrees of freedom\ndetermines the frequency dependence of the generalized\nsusceptibility and the nature of the quantum fluctuations, i.e., the dynamic critical exponent z 20 , at the PDW\nSQCP. The theory is equivalent to a quantum Gaussian\napproach and since the dynamic exponent turns out to\nbe z = 2, it yields the correct description of the SQCP\nfor dimensions d \u2265 2.\nWe start with the following Hamiltonian describing a\ntwo-band system with inter-band attractive interactions,\nX\nX\nX\n(1)\nnai nbi .\ntbij b\u2020i bj \u2212 U\ntaij a\u2020i aj +\nH0 =\ni\n\ni,j\n\ni,j\n\n14\n\nFor simplicity, we omitted spin indexes . The bands a\nand b can be the up and down spin bands of a metal polarized by an external magnetic field h11 , different types of\natoms or the hybridized bands of a multi-band metal13 .\nThe interaction U is an attractive interaction between\nthe fermions in different bands. We calculate the response of the normal two-band system to a wave-vector\nand frequency dependent fictitious field that couples to\nthe superconducting order parameter of interest. in this\ncase,\nX\neiq*ri ei\u03c90 t (a\u2020i b\u2020i + ai bi ),\n(2)\nH1 = \u2212g\ni\n\nwhere the frequency \u03c90 has a small positive imaginary\npart to guarantee the adiabatic switching on of the field.\nThe response of the system to the fictitious field, will\nbe obtained using perturbation theory for the retarded\nand advanced Green's functions16 . We start in the normal phase where the superconducting order parameter is\nzero in the absence of the external field g. We split the\nGreen's functions, normal and anomalous, in two contributions. The first of order zero and the second of first\norder in the field g.

The mismatch of the new Fermi\nwave-vectors is given by, \u03b4kF = kFa \u2212 kFb = h/vF , where\nvF is the Fermi velocity.

The\nquantum critical point separating the normal metal from\nthe superconducting PDW phase is obtained from the\ncondition, 1 \u2212 U \u03c7ab\n0 (2q, 0) = 0, which can be written as,\n\u0015\u001b\n\u0014\n\u0013\n\u001a\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1 1\nh\nq+1\n+ln(q 2 \u2212 1) = 0,\nU \u03c1 1\u2212ln\n\u2212\nln\n\u22060\n2 q\nq\u22121\n(9)\nwhere \u22060 = vF kC exp(\u22121/\u03c1U ). Notice that a PDW state\nis only possible for q > 1.

At zero temperature, as the external magnetic field or Fermi wave-vectors mismatch is reduced (indicated by the arrow), the normal metal becomes unstable to\nan inhomogeneous superconducting phase. This is signaled by\nthe divergence of the q-dependent generalized susceptibility.\nThe FFLO superconductor quantum critical point at hC has\na dynamic exponent z = 2 and this allows to determine the\nbehavior of the thermodynamic quantities along the critical\ntrajectory (CT) as given in the text. As the external field\nis further reduced there is a first order transition from the\nFFLO state to a BCS superconductor13 which is not studied\nhere. The crossover line T\u00d7 marks the onset of Fermi liquid\nbehavior with decreasing temperature.\n\nAs discussed in Ref.13 an FFLO phase can also be\ninduced by hybridization (V ). The results above can\nbe easily extended for the case of hybrid bands13 . The\nFermi wave-vectors mismatch is given by, kFa \u2212 kFb =\n4V /vF (1 + \u03b1), where \u03b1 < 1 is the ratio of the effective\nmasses of the quasi-particles. The mismatch is proportional to the hybridization V (or pressure), which now\nplays the role of the magnetic field.\nIn order to study the fluctuations close to the PDW\nSQCP we have to expand Eq. 7 for small frequencies \u03c90 ,\nh \u223c\n= hC and q \u223c\n= qC . At the same level of approximation for q of Eq. 8, we get for the denominator of the\ngeneralized susceptibility in Eq. 6,\n\u0015\n\u0014\n\u03c90\n1\nh\u2212hC\n2\nab\n+i\n+ 2\n(q\u2212qC ) .\n1\u2212U \u03c70 (2q, \u03c90 ) = U \u03c1\nhC\nvF qC qC\n\u22121\n(11)\nThe coupling of the superconductor order parameter to\nthe electronic degrees of freedom gives rise to Landau\ndamping of the superconductor quantum fluctuations.\nThese modes are purely evanescent with an imaginary\ndispersion relation.\nAs in Hertz approach20 to quantum phase transitions,\nwe can construct from the dynamical susceptibility a\nquantum Gaussian action for this problem21 , which can\nbe written as,\nZ\nZ\n\u0003\n\u0002\n(12)\nS = dd q d\u03c9 g + \u03c9 + q 2 |\u03c8(q, \u03c9)|2 ,\nwhere g = h \u2212 hC measures the distance to the PDW\nSQCP, \u03c8(q, \u03c9) is the PDW superconductor order param-\n\n\f4\neter and q \u2212 qC \u2192 q. The scaling properties of the free\nenergy associated with this action allows to identify the\ndynamic exponent of the SQCP at which the FFLO instability occurs. This is easily found as z = 2. The\nknowledge of the dynamic exponent and the quantum hyperscaling relation21,23 , 2 \u2212 \u03b1 = \u03bd(d + z), allows to fully\ncharacterize the universality class of the FFLO quantum\nphase transition. Since def f = d + z, for d = 2 and\nd = 3, the critical exponents are Gaussian with possible\nlogarithmic corrections for d = 2. The reason is that for\nd \u2265 2, interaction between the fluctuations are irrelevant\nin the renormalization group sense and the Gaussian action, Eq. 12, gives the correct description of the quantum\nphase transition21 .\nNext step in the calculations is to extend the results\nto finite temperatures and particularly to obtain the correction to the mean-field value of the shift exponent \u03c8\nof the critical line at very low temperatures close to the\nPDW SQCP. This can be carried out in different ways24,\nsuch that, TC (h) \u221d |h \u2212 hC |1/\u03c8 . It turns out that24\n\u03c8 = z/(d+z\u22122) for def f > 4 and can be determined from\nour knowledge of the dynamic exponent, which yields\n\u03c8 = 2/d. In the same way, scaling21 gives the contribution of quantum critical fluctuations to the specific heat,\nC/T \u221d T (d\u22122)/2 , along the critical trajectory (CT) shown\nin Fig. 1. Also shown in this figure is the crossover line21 ,\nT\u00d7 \u221d |h \u2212 hC |, below which the system enters a Fermi\nliquid regime.

We find that as the mismatch of the\nFermi wave-vectors is reduced, the system becomes unstable to an inhomogeneous, FFLO-like, superconducting\nphase characterized by a wave-vector q = q C . We have\nintroduced a new method to deal with systems coupled to\na space and time dependent external field and respond\nadiabatically to this perturbation. The appearance of\nsuperconductivity is related to the divergence of a static\ngeneralized susceptibility for q = q C at a SQCP. The\nresults obtained are valid to first order in the perturbation and coincide with those of linear response. However, in our approach the basic elements to be calculated\nare single particle Green's functions and not the usual\ntwo particle propagators of linear response theory. The\npresent theory extends the mean-field treatment to include fluctuations close to this SQCP. We have obtained\nthe dynamical critical exponent at the PDW SQCP and\nfrom that we have identified the universality class of this\nquantum critical point for d \u2265 2. This allows several predictions to be made for the thermodynamic and transport\nproperties close to the quantum phase transition and for\nthe shape of the critical line for dimensions d \u2265 2.\nWe would like to thank Igor Padilha for useful discussions and the Brazilian agencies, CNPq and FAPERJ for\npartial financial support.\n\n11\n\n12\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\nP.
