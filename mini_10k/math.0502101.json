A word hyperbolic group G is called GFERF if every quasiconvex\nsubgroup coincides with the intersection of finite index subgroups containing\nit. We show that in any such group, the product of finitely many quasiconvex\nsubgroups is closed in the profinite topology on G.\n\n1. Introduction\nLet G be a finitely generated group. The profinite topology PT (G) on G is\ndefined by proclaiming all finite index normal subgroups to be the basis of open\nneighborhoods of the identity element. It is easy to see that G equipped with this\ntopology becomes a topological group. This topology is Hausdorff if and only if G\nis residually finite.\nA subset P \u2286 G will be called separable if it is closed in the profinite topology\non G. Thus, a subgroup H \u2264 G is separable whenever it is an intersection of\nfinite index subgroups. The group G is said to be locally extended residually finite\n(LERF) if every finitely generated subgroup H \u2264 G is separable.\nA famous theorem of M. Hall states that free groups are LERF. Among other\nwell-known examples of LERF groups are surface groups and fundamental groups of\ncompact Seifert fibred 3-manifolds [26]. In [25] P. Schupp provided certain sufficient\nconditions for a Coxeter group to be LERF. R. Gitik [7] constructed an infinite\nfamily of LERF hyperbolic groups that are fundamental groups of hyperbolic 3manifolds.\nIn 1991 Pin and Reutenauer [23] conjectured that a product of finitely many\nfinitely generated subgroups in a free group is separable and listed some possible\napplications to groups and semigroups. In 1993 Ribes and Zalesski\u0131\u030c [24] showed\nthat the statement of this conjecture is true. Later a similar question was studied\nin other LERF groups by Coulbois [5], Gitik [8], Niblo [21], Steinberg [28] and\nothers.\nIn particular, Gitik in [8, Thm. 1] proved that in a LERF hyperbolic group, a\nproduct of two quasiconvex subgroups, one of which is malnormal, is separable.\nHowever, many word hyperbolic groups are not LERF. For example, an ascending HNN-extension of a finite rank free group is never LERF but very often\nhyperbolic (see [13]). So, it makes sense to use the weaker notion below.\nWe will say that a (word) hyperbolic group G is GFERF if every quasiconvex\nsubgroup H \u2264 G is separable. The definition of a GFERF Kleinian group \u0393 was\n2000 Mathematics Subject Classification. Primary 20F67, Secondary 20E26.\nKey words and phrases.

Ol'shanskii and M.\nSapir.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nASHOT MINASYAN\n\ngiven by Long and Reid in [17]: \u0393 is called geometrically finite extended residually\nfinite (GFERF) if each geometrically finite subgroup H \u2264 \u0393 is separable. Our\ndefinition is in the same spirit because in any word hyperbolic group (more generally, in any automatic group) a subgroup is geometrically finite if and only if it is\nquasiconvex (see [29]).\nLong, Reid and Agol gave several examples of GFERF groups [17], [2], [18]. Hsu\nand Wise [12] proved that certain right-angled Artin groups are GFERF. Some\nnegatively curved (i.e., word hyperbolic) groups with this property were studied\nby Gitik in [7]. In the paper [31] Wise provided another large family of GFERF\nhyperbolic groups; he also showed that the Figure 8 knot group is GFERF. The fact\nthat this group is LERF follows from the recent proofs by Agol [1] and CalegariGabai [4] of Marden's \"tameness\" conjecture. This conjecture provides a new way\nfor obtaining LERF and GFERF groups as fundamental groups of 3-manifolds.\nThe main goal of this paper is to prove the following\nTheorem 1.1. Assume G is a GFERF word hyperbolic group, G1 , G2 , . . . , Gs are\nquasiconvex subgroups, s \u2208 N. Then the product G1 G2 * * * Gs is separable in G.\nSince a finitely generated subgroup of a finite rank free group is quasiconvex,\nthe above theorem generalizes the result of Ribes and Zalesski\u0131\u030c [24] and provides\nan alternative proof of the conjecture [23]. An application of Theorem 1.1 to the\ncase when s = 2 and G2 is malnormal gives the statement of Gitik's theorem [8,\nThm. 1].\nOur proof of Theorem 1.1 uses geometry of quasigeodesics in negatively curved\nspaces and basic properties of quasiconvex subgroups.\nA subgroup H of a group G will be called almost malnormal if for every x \u2208 G\\H\nthe intersection H \u2229 xHx\u22121 is finite. H is said to be elementary if it is virtually\ncyclic. It is well known that in a hyperbolic group G any element of infinite order\nbelongs to a unique maximal elementary subgroup. Thus, any maximal elementary\nsubgroup of G is almost malnormal.\nA famous open problem in Geometric Group Theory addresses the existence\nof a (word) hyperbolic group that is not residually finite. The author would like\nto emphasize the importance of studying GFERF hyperbolic groups through the\nproposition below (after completion of this article the author found out that a\nsimilar statement has been already proved by D. Wise in [32, Rem. 11.8]).\nProposition. The following are equivalent.\n1) There exists a non-residually finite hyperbolic group.\n2) There is a hyperbolic group G having an almost malnormal quasiconvex\nsubgroup H which is not separable.\nProof. Assume the first condition holds. In this case Kapovich and Wise [14, Thm.\n1.2], and, independently, Ol'shanskii [22, Thm. 2], proved that there exists a nontrivial hyperbolic group G which has no proper subgroups of finite index at all.\nChoose an arbitrary maximal elementary subgroup H of G. Obviously H satisfies\nthe condition 2).\nNow, suppose 2) holds. Then, according to a theorem of Kharlampovich and\nMyasnikov [15, Thm. 2], the double D = G\u2217H G is a hyperbolic group. If the group\nD were residually finite then we could apply the theorem of Long and Niblo [16,\n\u00a72, Lemma] (see also [21]) stating that H is separable in G. The latter contradicts\nour assumptions. Hence, D is not residually finite.\n\u0003\n\n\fSEPARABLE SUBSETS OF GFERF NEGATIVELY CURVED GROUPS\n\n3\n\nPresently, the author doesn't know of any examples of hyperbolic groups that\nare not GFERF. So, it seems reasonable to ask\nQuestion. Does there exist a non-GFERF word hyperbolic group ?\nAs one can see from the Proposition, this question may be quite difficult.\nFinally, we note that in the case when a hyperbolic group G is GFERF, Theorem 1.1 provides a positive solution for Problem 3.11 posed by D. Wise in [30]. This\nproblem asks whether the double coset HK is separable if G is residually finite and\nH, K \u2264 G are separable quasiconvex subgroups.\n\nAcknowledgements\nThe author would like to thank Professors Alexander Ol'shanskii and Mark Sapir\nfor useful discussions, the referee and Dr. Dani Wise for their comments.\n2. Auxiliary information\nSuppose G is a group with a fixed finite symmetrized generating set A. If g \u2208 G,\n|g|G will denote the length of a shortest word over A representing g. Now we can\ndef\n\ndefine the standard left-invariant word metric d(*, *) on G by setting d(x, y) =\n|x\u22121 y|G for arbitrary x, y \u2208 G. This metric extends to a metric on the Cayley\ngraph \u0393(G, A) of the group G after endowing every edge with the metric of the\nsegment [0, 1] \u2282 R.\nA subset Q of G is said to be \u03b5-quasiconvex (where \u03b5 \u2265 0) if for any pair of\nelements u, v \u2208 Q and any geodesic segment p connecting u and v, p belongs to\na closed \u03b5-neighborhood of Q in \u0393(G, A). A subset Q \u2282 G is quasiconvex if it is\n\u03b5-quasiconvex for some \u03b5 \u2265 0.\nFor any two points x, y \u2208 \u0393(G, A) we fix a geodesic path between them and\ndenote it by [x, y]. If x, y, w \u2208 \u0393(G, A), then the number\n\u0010\n\u0011\ndef 1\nd(x, w) + d(y, w) \u2212 d(x, y)\n(x|y)w =\n2\nis called the Gromov product of x and y with respect to w.\nRemark 2.1. Since the metric is left-invariant, for arbitrary x, y, w \u2208 G we have\n(x|y)w = (w\u22121 x|w\u22121 y)1G .\nLet abc be a geodesic triangle in \u0393(G, A). There exist \"special\" points Oa \u2208 [b, c],\nOb \u2208 [a, c], Oc \u2208 [a, b] with the properties: d(a, Ob ) = d(a, Oc ) = \u03b1, d(b, Oa ) =\n= d(b, Oc ) = \u03b2, d(c, Oa ) = d(c, Ob ) = \u03b3. It is easy to see that \u03b1 = (b|c)a , \u03b2 =\n(a|c)b , \u03b3 = (a|b)c . Two points O \u2208 [a, b] and O\u2032 \u2208 [a, c] are called a-equidistant if\nd(a, O) = d(a, O\u2032 ) \u2264 \u03b1. The triangle abc is said to be \u03b4-thin if for any two points\nO, O\u2032 lying on its sides and equidistant from one of its vertices, d(O, O\u2032 ) \u2264 \u03b4 holds.\nThe group G is said to be (word) hyperbolic (or negatively curved) if there is\n\u03b4 \u2265 0 such that every geodesic triangle in \u0393(G, A) is \u03b4-thin (for more theory the\nreader is referred to [6],[3]).\nFor a hyperbolic group G, the property of a subset to be quasiconvex does not\ndepend on the choice of a generating set A (see [10]). A quasiconvex subgroup of\na finitely generated group is finitely generated itself ([3], [27]). A conjugate of a\nquasiconvex subgroup is quasiconvex as well ([19, Remark 2.2]).\n\n\f4\n\nASHOT MINASYAN\n\nFix an arbitrary GFERF hyperbolic group G. Then for n \u2208 N, f0 , f1 , . . . , fn \u2208 G\nand any quasiconvex subgroups G1 , . . . , Gn \u2264 G, the subset\n(1)\n\nP = f0 G1 f1 G2 * * * * * fn\u22121 Gn fn\n\nis called a quasiconvex product (here we use the terminology from [19]). Such a\nsubset is always quasiconvex ([11, Prop. 3.14], [19, Cor. 2.1]).\nRemark 2.2. Assume that n \u2208 N and for any n quasiconvex subgroups of the\ngroup G, their product is closed in PT (G). Then any quasiconvex product P\ndefined by (1) is also closed in PT (G).\nIndeed, observe that P = f \u011c1 * * * * * \u011cn where f = f0 f1 * * * * * fn \u2208 G and\n\u011ci = (fi fi+1 * * * fn )\u22121 Gi (fi fi+1 * * * fn ) \u2013 quasiconvex subgroups of G. By the assumptions, \u011c1 * * * * * \u011cn is separable, and since G (endowed with PT (G)) is a topological group, left translation by the element f \u22121 \u2208 G is a continuous operation,\nhence P is also separable.\nLemma 2.3. Assume that G is a \u03b4-hyperbolic group with respect to a finite generating set A and A, B are \u03b5-quasiconvex subgroups. There exists a constant C0 =\nC0 (\u03b4, \u03b5, G, A) \u2265 0 such that for any a \u2208 A, b \u2208 B the inequality (a\u22121 |b)1G \u2264 C0\nholds whenever a is a shortest representative of the coset a(A \u2229 B).\nProof. Define a finite subset of the group G by \u0398 = {g \u2208 AB | |g|G \u2264 2\u03b5 + \u03b4}. For\nevery g \u2208 \u0398 choose a pair (x, y) \u2208 A \u00d7 B satisfying g = x\u22121 y; let \u03a9 \u2282 A \u00d7 B denote\nthe (finite) set of these pairs. Consider\n\u03a91 = {x \u2208 A | (x, y) \u2208 \u03a9 for some y \u2208 B}.\nThen one can define the number C0 = max{|x|G | x \u2208 \u03a91 } + \u03b5 < \u221e.\nNow, assume that (a\u22121 |b)1G > C0 , for some a \u2208 A, b \u2208 B where a is a shortest\nrepresentative of the coset a(A \u2229 B). Let \u03b1 and \u03b2 denote the \"special\" points of the\ntriangle 1G a\u22121 b (in \u0393(G, A)) on the sides [1G , a\u22121 ] and [1G , b] respectively. Since\nA and B are \u03b5-quasiconvex there are elements a1 \u2208 A and b1 \u2208 B that are \u03b5-close\nto \u03b1 and \u03b2 correspondingly. Using the triangle inequality and \u03b4-hyperbolicity of\nthe space \u0393(G, A) we obtain\n|aa1 |G = d(a\u22121 , a1 ) \u2264 d(a\u22121 , \u03b1) + \u03b5 = d(a\u22121 , 1G ) \u2212 d(\u03b1, 1G ) + \u03b5 =\nd(a\u22121 , 1G ) \u2212 (a\u22121 |b)1G + \u03b5 < |a|G \u2212 C0 + \u03b5,\n|a\u22121\n1 b1 |G = d(a1 , b1 ) \u2264 d(a1 , \u03b1) + d(\u03b1, \u03b2) + d(\u03b2, b1 ) \u2264 2\u03b5 + \u03b4.\n\u22121\nBy definition, there exists a pair of elements (x, y) \u2208 \u03a9 with a\u22121\ny, thus\n1 b1 = x\na1 x\u22121 = b1 y \u22121 \u2208 A \u2229 B.

Assume G is a \u03b4-hyperbolic group, A and B are \u03b5-quasiconvex subgroups. Then for any N \u2265 0 there exists N1 = N1 (N, \u03b4, \u03b5, G, A) \u2265 0 such that the\nfollowing holds.

Then for the subgroup H = hA\u2032 , B \u2032 i \u2264 G one has\nON (1G ) \u2229 AHB \u2282 AB .\nProof. First, let \u01080 = \u01080 (\u03b4, \u03b5, G, A) be the constant given by Lemma 2.3. Define\nC0 = max{\u01080 , 14\u03b4}, \u03bb\u0304 = 1, c\u0304 = 0 and C1 = 12(C0 + \u03b4) + c\u0304 + 1. Now apply Lemma\n2.4 to find \u03bb = \u03bb\u0304/4 = 1/4 > 0 and c = c(\u03bb\u0304, c\u0304, C0 ) \u2265 0 from its claim.\nSet N1 = (N + c + 2C1 )/\u03bb and let A\u2032 \u2264 A and B \u2032 \u2264 B satisfy the conditions of\nthe lemma. Thus,\n(2)\n\nA\u2032 \u2229 ON1 (1G ) \u2282 A \u2229 B, B \u2032 \u2229 ON1 (1G ) \u2282 A \u2229 B\n\nDefine the subgroup H = hA\u2032 , B \u2032 i \u2264 G and consider an arbitrary element\ng \u2208 AHB\\(AB).\nThen\n(3)\n\ng = x0 y1 x1 y2 * * * xl yl+1 ,\n\nwhere l \u2208 N \u222a {0}, x0 \u2208 A, xi \u2208 A\u2032 \\{1G }, yi \u2208 B \u2032 \\{1G}, i = 1, . . . , l, yl+1 \u2208 B.\nMoreover, we can assume that x0 , x1 , . . . , xl , y1 , . . . , yl are shortest representatives\nof their left cosets modulo A \u2229 B (indeed, if there is x\u03030 = x0 z with z \u2208 A \u2229 B and\n|x\u03030 |G < |x0 |G , then x\u03030 \u2208 A, g = x\u03030 (zy1 )x1 y2 * * * xl yl+1 where zy1 \u2208 B \u2032 because of\nthe construction of A\u2032 ; and then a similar procedure can be performed for zy1 , and\nso on) and l is the smallest such integer. Therefore\n(4)\n\nxi \u2208 A\u2032 \\(A \u2229 B), yi \u2208 B \u2032 \\(A \u2229 B), i = 1, . . . , l.\n\nObserve that since g \u2208\n/ AB, l \u2265 1 and y1 \u2208 B \u2032 \\(A \u2229 B). Choose geodesic paths\nq1 , q2 , . . . , q2l+2 in \u0393(G, A) as follows: (q1 )\u2212 = 1G , elem(q1 ) = x0 , (q2 )\u2212 = (q1 )+ ,\nelem(q2 ) = y1 , . . . , (q2l+2 )\u2212 = (q2l+1 )+ , elem(q2l+2 ) = yl+1 . Thus, (q2l+2 )+ = g.\nUsing (4) and (2) we obtain kqi k > N1 \u2265 C1 = (C1 + c\u0304)/\u03bb\u0304, i = 2, 3, . . . , 2l + 1, and\n((qi )\u2212 |(qi+1 )+ )(qi )+ \u2264 C0 (by Remark 2.1 and Lemma 2.3) for i = 1, . . . , 2l + 1.\nNow, there can occur four different situations depending on how long the paths\nq1 and q2l+2 are:\n(a) kq1 k < C1 and kq2l+2 k < C1 ;\n(b) kq1 k \u2265 C1 and kq2l+2 k < C1 ;\n(c) kq1 k < C1 and kq2l+2 k \u2265 C1 ;\n(d) kq1 k \u2265 C1 and kq2l+2 k \u2265 C1 .\n\n\f6\n\nASHOT MINASYAN\n\nLet us consider the situation (b) (the others can be resolved in a completely\nanalogous fashion). Then the path q = q1 q2 . . . q2l+1 satisfies all the conditions\nof Lemma 2.4, hence it is (\u03bb, c)-quasigeodesic (for the numbers \u03bb, c defined in the\nbeginning of the proof).

Since geodesics and quasigeodesics with same\nends are mutually close ([3, 3.3]), the geodesic [1G , g] will lie in some neighborhood\nof q. If, in addition, the subgroups A\u2032 and B \u2032 are \u03b5\u2032 -quasiconvex, q will belong to\na closed \u03b5\u2032 -neighborhood of H in \u0393(G, A). Hence H becomes quasiconvex itself.\nThus, one obtains the statement below, first proved by R. Gitik:\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\nLemma 2.6. ([9, Thm. 1]) Let A and B be \u03b5-quasiconvex subgroups of a \u03b4hyperbolic group G. There exists a constant C2 , which depends only on G, \u03b4 and\n\u03b5, with the following property. For any quasiconvex subgroups A\u2032 \u2264 A and B \u2032 \u2264 B\nwith A\u2032 \u2229 B \u2032 = A \u2229 B, if all elements in A\u2032 and B \u2032 shorter than C2 belong to A \u2229 B,\nthen the subgroup hA\u2032 , B \u2032 i is also quasiconvex in G.\nCorollary 2.7. If G is a GFERF hyperbolic group and A, B are its quasiconvex\nsubgroups then the double coset AB is separable in G.\nProof. It is enough to show that for arbitrary g \u2208 G\\(AB) there exists a closed (in\nthe profinite topology) subset K of G such that AB \u2286 K and g \u2208\n/ K. Let C2 be\nthe constant given by Lemma 2.6. Set N = |g|G and find the corresponding N1 \u2265 0\nfrom the claim of Lemma 2.5. Denote N2 = max{N1 , C2 }. Since the subgroups\nA and B are closed in PT (G), then so is A \u2229 B; therefore there exist subgroups\nA\u2032 \u2264f A and B \u2032 \u2264f B (having finite indices in A and B correspondingly) such that\nA \u2229 B \u2282 A\u2032 , A \u2229 B \u2282 B \u2032 and ON2 (1G ) \u2229 (A\u2032 \u222a B \u2032 ) \u2282 A \u2229 B.

It remains to observe that AB \u2282 K = AHB, thus g \u2208\n/ K. Q.e.d. \u0003\n3. Proof of Theorem 1.1\nProof. We will use induction on s. If s = 1, the statement follows from the definition\nof a GFERF group. The case s = 2 is given by Corollary 2.7. So, we can now\nassume that s > 2 and the statement is already proved for a product of any (s \u2212 1)\nquasiconvex subgroups.\n\n\fSEPARABLE SUBSETS OF GFERF NEGATIVELY CURVED GROUPS\n\n7\n\nFor our convenience, denote k = s \u2212 2, A = Gs\u22121 , B = Gs .

Since the\ngroup G is GFERF, there exist A\u2032 \u2264f A and B \u2032 \u2264f B such that A\u2032 \u2229 B \u2032 = A \u2229 B\nand all the elements in A\u2032 and B \u2032 shorter than C2 belong to A \u2229 B.
