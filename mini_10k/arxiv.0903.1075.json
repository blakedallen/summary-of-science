The NESS is generated by means of a rotating laser beam\nwhich exerts on the particle a sinusoidal conservative force plus a constant non-conservative one.\nThe MFDT is shown to be perfectly verified by the experimental data. It can be interpreted as an\nequilibrium-like fluctuation-dissipation relation in the Lagrangian frame of the mean local velocity\nof the particle.\n\nThe validity of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem\n(FDT) in systems out of thermal equilibrium has been\nthe subject of intensive study during the last years. We\nrecall that for a system in equilibrium with a thermal\nbath at temperature T the FDT establishes a simple relation between the 2-time correlation function C(t \u2212 s)\nof a given observable and the linear response function\nR(t \u2212 s) of this observable to a weak external perturbation\n\u2202s C(t \u2212 s) = kB T R(t \u2212 s).\n\n(1)\n\nHowever, Eq. (1) is not necessarily fulfilled out of equilibrium and violations are observed in a variety of systems such as glassy materials [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], granular matter [6], and biophysical systems [7]. This motivated a theoretical work devoted to a search of a general framework describing FD relations, see the review\n[8] or [9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14] for recent attempts in\nsimple stochastic systems. In the same spirit, a modified fluctuation-dissipation theorem (MFDT) has been\nrecently formulated for a non-equilibrium steady dynamics governed by the Langevin equation with nonconservative forces [15]. In particular, this MFDT holds\nfor the overdamped motion of a particle on a circle, with\nangular position \u03b8, in the presence of a periodic potential H(\u03b8) = H(\u03b8 + 2\u03c0) and a constant non-conservative\nforce F\n\u03b8\u0307 = \u2212\u2202\u03b8 H(\u03b8) + F + \u03b6,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere \u03b6 is a white noise term of mean h\u03b6t i = 0 and\ncovariance h\u03b6t \u03b6s i = 2D\u03b4(t \u2212 s), with D the (bare) diffusivity. This is a system that may exhibit an increase in\nthe effective diffusivity [16, 17]. Here, we shall study the\ndynamical non-equilibrium steady state (NESS) reached\nfor observables that depend only on the particle position on the circle so are periodic functions of the angle\n\u03b8. Such a state corresponds to a constant non-vanishing\nprobability current j along the circle and a periodic invariant probability density function \u03c10 (\u03b8) that allow us\nto define a mean local velocity v0 (\u03b8) = j/\u03c10 (\u03b8). This is\nthe average velocity of the particle at \u03b8. For a stochastic system in NESS evolving according to Eq. (2), the\n\nMFDT reads for t \u2265 s\n\u2202s C(t \u2212 s) \u2212 b(t \u2212 s) = kB T R(t \u2212 s),\n\n(3)\n\nwhere the 2-time correlation of a given observable O(\u03b8)\nis defined by\nC(t \u2212 s) = h O(\u03b8t )O(\u03b8s ) i0 ,\n\n(4)\n\nand the linear response function to a \u03b4-perturbation of\nthe conjugated variable ht is given by the functional\nderivative\nR(t \u2212 s) =\n\n\u03b4\n\u03b4hs\n\nh O(\u03b8t ) ih .\n\n(5)\n\nh=0\n\nIn Eq. (5), h...ih denotes the average in the perturbed\ntime-dependent state obtained from the NESS by replacing H(\u03b8) in Eq. (2) by H(\u03b8) \u2212 ht O(\u03b8). It reduces\nfor h = 0 to the NESS average h...i0 . In Eq. (3), the\ncorrelation b(t \u2212 s) is given by\nb(t \u2212 s) = h O(\u03b8t )v0 (\u03b8s )\u2202\u03b8 O(\u03b8s ) i0 .\n\n(6)\n\nThis new term takes into account the extent of the violation of the usual fluctuation-dissipation relation (1)\ndue to the probability current and it plays the role of a\ncorrective term to C(t \u2212 s) in the MFDT, Eq. (3), which\ncan be rewritten in the integral form:\nC(0) \u2212 C(t) \u2212 B(t) = kB T \u03c7(t),\n(7)\nRt\nRt\nwhere B(t) \u2261 0 b(t \u2212 s)ds and \u03c7(t) = 0 R(t \u2212 s)ds is\nthe integrated response function.\nIn this letter, we present an experimental test of\nEq. (7) in the linear response regime around a NESS\nattained by a micron-sized particle in a toroidal optical trap similar to the one used in [12]. We first show\nthat the dynamics of the particle is well described by the\nLangevin equation (2) on a circle. Secondly, by measuring v0 , B(t), C(t) and \u03c7(t), we verify Eq. (7) for the\nobservable O(\u03b8) = sin \u03b8. The result can be interpreted\nas an equilibrium-like fluctuation-dissipation relation in\nthe Lagrangian frame of the mean local velocity v0 (\u03b8)\n[15].

The arrow indicates\nthe direction of the non-conservative force f .\n\nThe experiment is performed using a spherical silica\nparticle of radius r =1 \u03bcm in ultrapure water at room\ntemperature T = 20.0 \u00b1 0.5\u25e6 C at which the dynamic\nviscosity of water is \u03b7 = (1.002 \u2213 0.010) \u00d7 10\u22123 Pa s.\nThe particle is kept by an optical tweezers in a toroidal\noptical trap. This kind of trap consists on a Nd:YAG\ndiode pumped solid state laser beam (\u03bb = 1064 nm)\nwhich is focused by a microscope objective (63\u00d7, NA\n= 1.4) and scans (by means of two acousto-optic deflectors) a circle of radius a = 4.12 \u03bcm in the horizontal\nplane at a rotation frequency of 200 Hz. The toroidal\ntrap is created 10 \u03bcm above the inner bottom surface of\nthe cell where hydrodynamic boundary-coupling effects\non the particle are negligible. At a rotation frequency\nof 200 Hz, the laser beam is not able to hold the particle but drags it regularly a small distance on the circle\nwhen passing through it [18]. The diffusive motion of\nthe particle along the radial and vertical directions during the absence of the beam is less than 40 nm, thus\nthe angular position of the particle \u03b8 (measured modulo\n2\u03c0) is the only relevant degree of freedom of the dynamics. The laser power is sinusoidally modulated around\n30 mW with an amplitude of 7% of the mean power,\nsynchronously with the deflection of the beam at 200\nHz creating a static sinusoidal intensity profile along the\ncircle. This trapping situation acts as a constant nonconservative force f associated to the mean kick which\ndrives the particle across a sinusoidal potential U (\u03b8) due\nto the periodic intensity profile. The particle barycenter\n(xt , yt ) is measured by image analysis with an accuracy\n\nof the order of 1 nm at a sampling rate of 150 Hz and\nexposure time of 1/300 s. This measure allows us to\ndetermine the angular position of the particle \u03b8t with\nrespect to the trap center. For more details about the\nexperimental apparatus see Ref. [19]. We determine the\nvalue of f and the profile of U (\u03b8) by means of the method\ndescribed in [20]. This method exploits the probability\ncurrent j and the invariant density \u03c10 (\u03b8) in NESS to\nreconstruct the actual energy landscape of the particle.\nWe recorded 200 time series {\u03b8t } of duration 66.67 s\nwith different initial conditions {\u03b80 } sampled every 5\nminutes in order to measure j and \u03c10 (\u03b8). The probability current is related to the global mean velocity of the\nparticle by the expression j = h\u03b8\u0307i0 /(2\u03c0). The value of\nh\u03b8\u0307i0 is calculated from the slope of the linear fit of the\nmean angular position of the particle (not taken modulo\n2\u03c0) as a function of time leading to j = 3.76 \u00d7 10\u22122 s\u22121\nin the direction of the laser beam rotation. The invariant density, shown as a solid black line in Fig. 1(a), is\ncomputed from the histogram of each time series {\u03b8t }\naveraged over the 200 different initial conditions. In\nFig. 1(a) we also show the mean local velocity v0 (\u03b8) =\nj/\u03c10 (\u03b8) of the particle. From these quantities we obtain\nR 2\u03c0\nf = 3\u03b7raj 0 \u03c10 (\u03b8\u2032 )\u22121 d\u03b8\u2032 = 6.60 \u00d7 10\u221214 N and U (\u03b8) =\nR\u03b8\n\u2212kB T log \u03c10 (\u03b8) + 0 (f \u2212 6\u03c0\u03b7raj\u03c10 (\u03b8\u2032 )\u22121 )ad\u03b8\u2032 = A sin \u03b8\nwith amplitude A = 68.8kB T . The experimental potential profile is shown in Fig. 1(b) (black solid line). Hence,\nthe time evolution of \u03b8 is claimed to follow the Langevin\ndynamics of Eq. (2) [20] with F = f /(6\u03c0\u03b7ra) = 0.85\nrad s\u22121 , H(\u03b8) = U (\u03b8)/(6\u03c0\u03b7ra2 ) = H0 sin \u03b8, H0 =\nA/(6\u03c0\u03b7ra2 ) = 0.87 rad s\u22121 , and D = kB T /(6\u03c0\u03b7ra2 ) =\n1.26 \u00d7 10\u22122 rad2 s\u22121 . Note that in the corresponding\nequilibrium situation (f = 0) the probability maximum\nwould be located at the minimum of U (\u03b8) (\u03b8 = 3\u03c0/2).\nHowever, in NESS the non-conservative force f > 0\nshifts the maximum of \u03c10 (\u03b8) in the positive direction,\nas shown in Fig. 1(a). The choice of the parameters\nhas been done to enhance the stochastic nature of the\ndynamics, i.e. we take (F \u2212 H0 )/H0 \u2248 \u22122% which is\nclose to the maximum increase of the effective diffusivity\nfollowing Refs. [16, 17].\nAdditionally, 500 times series of duration 100 s were\nspecially devoted for the determination of \u03c7(t). In this\ncase, during each interval of 100 s we apply from time\nt0 to t0 + \u2206t with 0 < t0 < 66.67 s and \u2206t = 33.33 s\na step perturbation changing the value of A to A + \u03b4A.\nThis is accomplished by suddenly switching the laser\npower modulation from 7% to 7.35% of the mean power\n(30 mW). The experimental value of the amplitude perturbation (\u03b4A = 0.05A) is determined from independent\nNESS measurements of \u03c10 (\u03b8) and U (\u03b8) for a power modulation of 7.35% (shown in Figs. 1(a) and 1(b) respectively as red dashed lines) as described previously. By\nkeeping constant the mean power during the switch we\nensure that the value of f remains also constant, compare to a different time-dependent protocol explored re-\n\n\f3\n0.25\n\nC(0)\u2212C(t)\nB(t)\nkBT \u03c7(t)\n\n0.2\n\nC(0)\u2212C(t)\u2212B(t)\n\n0.15\n\n0.1\n\n0.05\n\n(a)\n0\n\nk T \u03c7(t) (\u03b4 A = 0.05 A)\n\n0.04\n\nB\n\nk T \u03c7(t) (\u03b4 A = 0.07 A)\n\nin Fig. 1(a)) and the integrated response \u03c7(t) for this\nobservable, as functions of the time lag t.\nThe determination of C(t) and B(t) is straightforward\naccording to Eqs.

We show a perturbed trajectory (thick\ndashed red line) and four out of a total of 200 of the corresponding unperturbed ones (see text).\n\ncently in [21]. In this way, we extract 500 perturbed\ntrajectories {\u03b8t }\u03b4A of duration \u2206t = 33.33 s. We ensure\nthat after switching off the perturbation the system actually has attained a NESS before the beginning of the\nnext step perturbation.\nWith the purpose of determining correctly the different terms involved in Eq. (7), the observable O(\u03b8) must\nbe chosen consistently on both sides of such relation.\nThe change of the potential U (\u03b8) \u2192 U (\u03b8) + \u03b4A sin \u03b8 due\nto the application of the step perturbation implies that\nO(\u03b8) = sin \u03b8 is the observable that must be studied with\n\u2212\u03b4A as its conjugate variable. Hence, we compute the\ncorrelation function C(t), the corrective term B(t) (with\n\u2202\u03b8 O(\u03b8) = cos \u03b8 and the experimental curve v0 (\u03b8) shown\n\nh O(\u03b8t ) i\u03b4A \u2212 h O(\u03b8t ) i0\n.\n\u2212\u03b4A\n\n(8)\n\nIn Eq. (8) the value t = 0 corresponds to instant t0\nwhen the perturbation of the potential amplitude \u03b4A is\nswitched on. To decrease the statistical errors in comparison of the terms in Eq. (8), for a given perturbed\ntrajectory \u03b8t\u03b4A we look for as many unperturbed ones\n\u03b8t as possible among the 200 time series {\u03b8t } starting at\na time t\u2217 such that O(\u03b8t\u2217 ) = O(\u03b80\u03b4A ). Then we redefine\nt\u2217 as t = 0 in Eq. (8), as shown in Fig. 3. The unperturbed trajectories found in this way allow us to define a\nsubensemble over which the average hO(\u03b8t )i0 in Eq. (8)\nis computed at a given t. The average hO(\u03b8t )i\u03b4A is simply computed over the 500 perturbed time series. In Fig.\n2(a) we show in thick dashed red line the dependence of\nthe integrated response on t.\nThe comparison between the different terms needed\nto verify Eq. (3) is shown in Fig. 2(a), for the time lag\ninterval 0 < t < 3.5 s. As expected, the usual FD relation (1) is strongly violated in this NESS because of\nthe broken detailed balance, with the correlation term\nC(0) \u2212 C(t) being one order of magnitude larger than\nthe response term kB T \u03c7(t). However, with the corrective term B(t) associated to the probability current subtracted, C(0) \u2212 C(t) \u2212 B(t) shown in solid black line in\nFig. 2(a), becomes equal to kB T \u03c7(t). For clarity, in Fig.\n2(b) we show an expanded view of the of the curves\nC(0) \u2212 C(t) \u2212 B(t) and kB T \u03c7(t). We observe that,\nwithin the experimental error bars, the agreement between both terms is quite good, verifying the integrated\nform of the modified FD relation (7). The error bars\nof the integrated response curve at each time lag t are\nobtained from the standard deviation of the subensemble of unperturbed trajectories found for each perturbed\ntrajectory, like the ones shown in thin solid lines in\nFig. 3. We checked that the perturbation \u03b4A = 0.05A\nis small enough to remain within the linear response\nregime. This is quantitatively seen in Fig. 2(b) where\nthe response measured at \u03b4A = 0.07A is represented by\ncircles. We see that \u03c7(t) is independent of \u03b4A within\nexperimental errors showing that we are in the linear\nresponse regime. The MFDT is checked only for the\nfirst 3.5 s because after this time the evaluation of \u03c7(t)\nis affected by large errors.

(7) for the fluctuations of the angular position of the silica particle in\nNESS gains a simpler interpretation in the Lagrangian\nframe of the mean local velocity v0 (\u03b8) along the circle.\nIndeed, using the observables that are time indepen-\n\n[1] L.

(1)) except for the\nlack of the time translation invariance of the functions\ninvolved. One of the new predictions of the Lagrangian\nanalysis of the system is that, although the trajectories\nin the Eulerian and the Lagrangian frame are quite different, their average density \u03c10 is the same in the two\nframes. This property is clearly illustrated by the experimental data in Fig. 4, where we compare the densities\nmeasured in the two frames. The insets of Fig. 4 point\nout to the difference between a trajectory measured in\nthe Eulerian frame and the same trajectory measured in\nthe Lagrangian frame.\nWe have verified experimentally a modified\nfluctuation-dissipation relation describing the dynamics of a system with one degree of freedom in NESS,\nnamely a Brownian particle moving in a toroidal optical\ntrap. We point out that the experimental results\nreported here represent an alternative approach to\nnon-equilibrium fluctuation-dissipation relations to that\nof Ref. [12] which dealt with the velocity fluctuations\nrelative to the mean local velocity. The approach\nfollowed in our work relies on an observable depending\non the particle position. It quantifies the extent of the\nviolation of the usual FDT by means of the term B(t),\nadmitting a transparent Lagrangian interpretation of\nthe resulting MFDT.\n\n[12] V. Blickle, T. Speck, C.
