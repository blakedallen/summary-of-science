Petrache\n\narXiv:1111.6839v1 [math.HO] 23 Nov 2011\n\nDepartment of Physics, Indiana University Purdue University Indianapolis,\nIndianapolis, IN 46202\nNovember 7, 2018\n\nAbstract\nIt is shown that with appropriate boundary conditions, a real function satisfying the\ndifferential equation f \u2032 (x) = f (x + a) has all known properties of the sine function.\nA number of elementary derivations are presented including proofs for periodicity\nand trigonometric identities.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn elementary analysis, the sine and cosine functions are identified as the two linearly\nindependent solutions of the second order differential equation f \u2032\u2032 = \u2212f . Therefore,\nany function f that satisfies this harmonic equation is periodic, bounded, and satisfies a number of trigonometric identities. However, many of these trigonometric\nproperties are derived not from f \u2032\u2032 = \u2212f but from alternative definitions of sine and\ncosine functions. These alternatives include primarily geometrical definitions based\non right triangles and unit circles [1,2,3], power series and complex exponentials\n[4,5], and integral forms of arc lengths [6,7]. The question then is what properties\nfollow directly from f \u2032\u2032 = \u2212f . For example, it is quite easy to show by direct differentiation that f 2 + f \u20322 = const., which then implies that f and f \u2032 are both bounded.\nHowever, other properties are more difficult to prove in abstract form, e.g. the fact\n1\n\n\fthat f is periodic. An even more interesting question is whether there is any other\nproperty of the sine and cosine functions from which all known properties can be\nderived. Here it is shown that the differential equation f \u2032 (x) = f (x + a) specifies the\nsine function given the appropriate boundary conditions. Derivations are carried at\nan abstract level that does not involve series expansions or complex exponentials.\n\n2\n\nDerivations\n\nConsider the differential equation\nf \u2032 (x) = f (x + a),\n\n(1)\n\nin which the argument x and the constant a are real. In the following treatment we\nassume that f is well defined on the entire real axis, is of class C 2 or higher, and it\nis not identically zero.\nLet us first note that the differential operator changes the parity (symmetry) of\nan odd or even function. If f is odd then f \u2032 is even and vice versa. For the\nabove equation to hold, the translation operator that takes f (x) into f (x + a) must\nperform the same symmetry transformation as the differential operator. From this\nperspective, we will investigate solutions of Eq. 1 with well defined parity.\nProposition 1. f \u2032 (x) = f (x + a) implies that f is periodic.\nProof. Use notation g(x) = f \u2032 (x) and assume that f is odd. (The proof for an even\nEq. 1\ndef\nfunction is similar.) If f is odd then g = f \u2032 is even. We have f (x) = f \u2032 (x \u2212 a) =\nsym\nEq. 1\nsym\ng(x \u2212 a) = g(\u2212x + a) = f (\u2212x + 2a) = \u2212f (x \u2212 2a), where the text above\nthe equal sign indicates the property used at each step, and where sym stands for\nsymmetry and def for the definition (notation) g = f \u2032 . We have obtained that\nf (x) = \u2212f (x \u2212 2a) for any x, which implies that f (x \u2212 2a) = \u2212f (x \u2212 4a), so that\n2\n\n\ff (x) = f (x \u2212 4a) for any x. It means that f is periodic of period 4a.\nProposition 2. f \u2032 (x) = f (x + a) implies that g \u2032 (x) = g(x + a), where g = f \u2032 .\nEq. 1\nProof. g \u2032 (x) = f \u2032\u2032 (x) = f \u2032 (x + a) = g(x + a).\n\nProposition 3. f \u2032 (x) = f (x + a) implies that g \u2032 (x) = \u2212f (x), where g = f \u2032 .\nsym\n\ndef\n\nProof. Using Proposition 2, we have g \u2032 (x) = g(x + a) = g(\u2212x \u2212 a) = f \u2032 (\u2212x \u2212\nEq. 1\nsym\na) = f (\u2212x \u2212 a + a) = f (\u2212x) = \u2212f (x). We have in fact proven that f satisfies\nthe second order differential equation\nf \u2032\u2032 = \u2212f.\n\n(2)\n\nProposition 4. f 2 + g 2 = constant.\nNeed to show that the derivative of f 2 +g 2 is zero. We have f f \u2032 +gg \u2032 = f f \u2032 +f \u2032 (\u2212f ) =\n0. Because the functions f and g are specified up to an arbitrary scale, we can choose\nthe constant to be 1 without loss of generality. If f is odd, we have f (0) = 0 and\ntherefore g(0) = \u00b11 and we can choose g(0) = 1.\nProposition 5. The functions f and g = f \u2032 are linearly independent.\nProof. Assume that f = cf \u2032 with c a real constant. We have f \u2032 = cf \u2032\u2032 = \u2212cf =\n\u2212c2 f \u2032 , implying that c2 = \u22121 which contradicts the assumption that c was real.\n(Alternatively, it can be verified that the Wronskian of f and f \u2032 is non-zero.)\nProposition 6. If f is a solution of f \u2032\u2032 = \u2212f , then g = f \u2032 is also a solution and f\nand g are linearly independent.\nProof. g \u2032\u2032 = f \u2032\u2032\u2032 = \u2212f \u2032 = \u2212g. Linear independence was proven above.\nProposition 7. f \u2032\u2032 = \u2212f implies that f (x + y) = f \u2032 (y)f (x) + f (y)f \u2032(x).\nProof. First note that f (x + y) is a solution of f \u2032\u2032 = \u2212f for any y, where the\nderivative is with respect to the variable x. That means that f (x + y) is a linear\n3\n\n\fcombination of f and f \u2032 , which were shown earlier to be independent solutions of\nEq. 2. We have\nf (x + y) = A(y)f (x) + B(y)f \u2032(x),\n\n(3)\n\nwhere the coefficients A and B are functions of y. With f (0) = 0 and f \u2032 (0) = 1, we\nhave\nf (0 + y) = A(y)f (0) + B(y)f \u2032(0)\n\n(4)\n\nf (x \u2212 x) = A(\u2212x)f (x) + B(\u2212x)f \u2032 (x),\n\n(5)\n\nwhich gives B(y) = f (y) and A(\u2212x)f (x)+B(\u2212x)f \u2032 (x) = 0. Therefore, A(\u2212x)f (x)\u2212\nf (x)f \u2032 (x) = 0 for any x, so A(\u2212x) \u2212 f \u2032 (x) = 0, giving A(x) = f \u2032 (\u2212x) = f \u2032 (x).\nFor any x and y we have obtained that\nf (x + y) = A(y)f (x) + B(y)f \u2032(x) = f \u2032 (y)f (x) + f (y)f \u2032(x),\n\n(6)\n\nProposition 8. f \u2032\u2032 = \u2212f implies that fmax f \u2032 (x) = f (x + a), where fmax = f (a).\nProof. If f (a) = fmax then f \u2032 (a) = 0 (Proposition 4) and using Proposition 7,\nf (x + a) = f \u2032 (a)f (x) + f (a)f \u2032 (x) = fmax f \u2032 (x). Choosing fmax = 1, we obtain\nf \u2032 (x) = f (x + a).\n\n3\n\nConclusions\n\nBased on the above development, we can conclude that the differential equations\nf \u2032 (x) = f (x + a) and f \u2032\u2032 = \u2212f are equivalent in that each can be regarded as\na fundamental property that defines the sine function. To be more precise, each\nequation defines a general linear combination of sine and cosine from which the sine\nfunction is selected with the appropriate choice of symmetry and overall amplitude.\nThe differential equations satisfied by the sine and cosine functions have theoretical\n4\n\n\fsignificance not only in mathematics but also in physics and other applied fields.\nHowever, as opposed to the well known harmonic equation that describes the motion\nof oscillators, Eq. 1 appears under-appreciated. As presented here, Eq. 1 represents\nthe particular case in which the action of two distinct operators (differential and\ntranslation operator) coincides on a subset of state functions.\nAcknowledgments\nThe author thanks Pat DeMoss, Heather Stout, and Kashyap Vasavada for valuable\ndiscussions and suggestions for the manuscript.\nReferences\n[1] A.
