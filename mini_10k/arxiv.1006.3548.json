The recent construction and analysis of deformations of quantum field theories\nby warped convolutions is extended to a class of curved spacetimes. These spacetimes carry\na family of wedge-like regions which share the essential causal properties of the Poincar\u00e9\ntransforms of the Rindler wedge in Minkowski space. In the setting of deformed quantum field\ntheories, they play the role of typical localization regions of quantum fields and observables.\nAs a concrete example of such a procedure, the deformation of the free Dirac field is studied.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nDeformations of quantum field theories arise in different contexts and have been studied\nfrom different points of view in recent years. One motivation for considering such models\nis a possible noncommutative structure of spacetime at small scales, as suggested by\ncombining classical gravity and the uncertainty principle of quantum physics [DFR95].\nQuantum field theories on such noncommutative spaces can then be seen as deformations\nof usual quantum field theories, and it is hoped that they might capture some aspects of\na still elusive theory of quantum gravity (cf. [Sza03] for a review). By now there exist\nseveral different types of deformed quantum field theories, see [GW05, BPQV08, Sol08,\nGL08, BGK+ 08, BDFP10] for some recent papers, and references cited therein.\nCertain deformation techniques arising from such considerations can also be used as\na device for the construction of new models in the framework of usual quantum field\ntheory on commutative spaces [GL07, BS08, GL08, BLS10, LW10], independent of their\nconnection to the idea of noncommutative spaces. From this point of view, the deformation parameter plays the role of a coupling constant which changes the interaction of the\nmodel under consideration, but leaves the classical structure of spacetime unchanged.\nDeformations designed for either describing noncommutative spacetimes or for constructing new models on ordinary spacetimes have been studied mostly in the case of a\nflat manifold, either with a Euclidean or Lorentzian signature. In fact, many approaches\nrely on a preferred choice of Cartesian coordinates in their very formulation, and do not\ngeneralize directly to curved spacetimes. The analysis of the interplay between spacetime curvature and deformations involving noncommutative structures thus presents a\n1\n\n\fchallenging problem. As a first step in this direction, we study in the present paper how\ncertain deformed quantum field theories can be formulated in the presence of external\ngravitational fields (i.e., on curved spacetime manifolds), see also [ABD+ 05, OS09] for\nother approaches to this question. We will not address here the fundamental question\nof dynamically coupling the matter fields with a possible noncommutative geometry of\nspacetime [PV04, Ste07], but rather consider as an intermediate step deformed quantum\nfield theories on a fixed Lorentzian background manifold M .\nA deformation technique which is well suited for our purposes is that of warped convolutions, see [BS08] and [GL07, GL08] for precursors and related work. Starting from a\nHilbert space H carrying a representation U of IRn , the warped convolution AQ of an\noperator A on H is defined as\nZ\n\u2212n\nAQ = (2\u03c0)\ndn x dn y e\u2212ixy U (Qx)AU (y \u2212 Qx) .\n(1.1)\nHere Q is an antisymmetric (n \u00d7 n)-matrix playing the role of deformation parameter,\nand the integral can be defined in an oscillatory sense if A and U meet certain regularity\nrequirements. For deformations of a single algebra, the mapping A \u2192 AQ has many\nfeatures in common with deformation quantization and the Weyl-Moyal product, and in\nfact was recently shown [BLS10] to be equivalent to specific representations of Rieffel's\ndeformed C \u2217 -algebras with IRn -action [Rie92]. In application to field theory models,\nhowever, one has to deform a whole family of algebras, corresponding to subsystems\nlocalized in spacetime, and the parameter Q has to be replaced by a family of matrices\n{Q} adapted to the geometry of the underlying spacetime.\nTo apply this scheme to quantum field theories on curved manifolds, we will consider\nspacetimes with a sufficiently large isometry group containing two commuting Killing\nfields, which give rise to a representation of IR2 as required in (1.1). This setting is wide\nenough to encompass a number of cosmologically relevant manifolds such as FriedmannRobertson-Walker spacetimes, or Bianchi models. Making use of the algebraic framework of quantum field theory [Haa96, Ara99], we can then formulate quantum field\ntheories in an operator-algebraic language and study their deformations. Despite the\nfact that the warped convolution was invented for the deformation of Minkowski space\nquantum field theories, it turns out that all reference to the particular structure of flat\nspacetime, such as Poincar\u00e9 transformations and a Poincar\u00e9 invariant vacuum state, can\nbe avoided.\nWe are interested in understanding to what extent the familiar structure of quantum\nfield theories on curved spacetimes is preserved under such deformations, and investigate\nin particular covariance and localization properties. Concerning locality, it is known that\nin warped models on Minkowski space, point-like localization is weakened to localization\nin certain infinitely extended, wedge-shaped regions [GL07, BS08, GL08, BLS10]. These\nregions are defined as Poincar\u00e9 transforms of the Rindler wedge\nWR := {(x0 , x1 , x2 , x3 ) \u2208 IR4 : x1 > |x0 |} .\n\n(1.2)\n\nBecause of their intimate relation to the Poincar\u00e9 symmetry of Minkowski spacetime, it is\nnot obvious what a good replacement for such a collection of regions is in the presence\n2\n\n\fof non-vanishing curvature. In fact, different definitions are possible, and wedges on\nspecial manifolds have been studied by many authors in the literature [Kay85, BB99,\nReh00, BMS01, GLRV01, BS04, LR07, Str08, Bor09].\nIn Section 2, the first main part of our investigation, we show that on those fourdimensional curved spacetimes which allow for the application of the deformation methods in [BLS10], and thus carry two commuting Killing fields, there also exists a family\nof wedges with causal properties analogous to the Minkowski space wedges. Because of\nthe prominent role wedges play in many areas of Minkowski space quantum field theory [BW75, Bor92, Bor00, BDFS00, BGL02], this geometric and manifestly covariant\nconstruction is also of interest independently of its relation to deformations.\nIn Section 3, we then consider quantum field theories on curved spacetimes, and\ndeform them by warped convolution. We first show that these deformations can be\ncarried through in a model-independent, operator-algebraic framework, and that the\nemerging models share many structural properties with deformations of field theories\non flat spacetime (Section 3.1). In particular, deformed quantum fields are localized in\nthe wedges of the considered spacetime. These and further aspects of deformed quantum\nfield theories are also discussed in the concrete example of a Dirac field in Section 3.2.\nSection 4 contains our conclusions.\n\n2\n\nGeometric setup\n\nTo prepare the ground for our discussion of deformations of quantum field theories on\ncurved backgrounds, we introduce in this section a suitable class of spacetimes and\nstudy their geometrical properties. In particular, we show how the concept of wedges,\nknown from Minkowski space, generalizes to these manifolds. Recall in preparation\nthat a wedge in four-dimensional Minkowski space is a region which is bounded by\ntwo non-parallel characteristic hyperplanes [TW97], or, equivalently, a region which\nis a connected component of the causal complement of a two-dimensional spacelike\nplane. The latter definition has a natural analogue in the curved setting. Making use of\nthis observation, we construct corresponding wedge regions in Section 2.1, and analyse\ntheir covariance, causality and inclusion properties. At the end of that section, we\ncompare our notion of wedges to other definitions which have been made in the literature\n[BB99, BMS01, BS04, LR07, Bor09], and point out the similarities and differences.\nIn Section 2.2, the abstract analysis of wedge regions is complemented by a number\nof concrete examples of spacetimes fulfilling our assumptions.\n\n2.1\n\nEdges and wedges in curved spacetimes\n\nIn the following, a spacetime (M, g) is understood to be a four-dimensional, Hausdorff,\n(arcwise) connected, smooth manifold M endowed with a smooth, Lorentzian metric g\nwhose signature is (+, \u2212, \u2212, \u2212). Notice that it is automatically guaranteed that M is\nalso paracompact and second countable [Ger68, Ger70]. The (open) causal complement\nof a set O \u2282 M is defined as\ni\nh\n0\n+\n\u2212\n(2.1)\nO := M \\ J (O) \u222a J (O) ,\n3\n\n\fwhere J \u00b1 (O) is the causal future respectively past of O in M [Wal84, Section 8.1].\nTo avoid pathological geometric situations such as closed causal curves, and also to\ndefine a full-fledged Cauchy problem for a free field theory whose dynamics is determined\nby a second order hyperbolic partial differential equation, we will restrict ourselves to\nglobally hyperbolic spacetimes. So in particular, M is orientable and time-orientable,\nand we fix both orientations. While this setting is standard in quantum field theory\non curved backgrounds, we will make additional assumptions regarding the structure of\nthe isometry group Iso(M, g) of (M, g), motivated by our desire to define wedges in M\nwhich resemble those in Minkowski space.\nOur most important assumption on the structure of (M, g) is that it admits two\nlinearly independent, spacelike, complete, commuting smooth Killing fields \u03be1 , \u03be2 , which\nwill later be essential in the context of deformed quantum field theories. We refer here\nand in the following always to pointwise linear independence, which entails in particular\nthat these vector fields have no zeros. Denoting the flows of \u03be1 , \u03be2 by \u03c6\u03be1 , \u03c6\u03be2 , the orbit\nof a point p \u2208 M is a smooth two-dimensional spacelike embedded submanifold of M ,\nE := {\u03c6\u03be1 ,s1 (\u03c6\u03be2 ,s2 (p)) \u2208 M : s1 , s2 \u2208 IR} ,\n\n(2.2)\n\nwhere s1 , s2 are the flow parameters of \u03be1 , \u03be2 .\nSince M is globally hyperbolic, it is isometric to a smooth product manifold IR \u00d7 \u03a3,\nwhere \u03a3 is a smooth, three-dimensional embedded Cauchy hypersurface. It is known\nthat the metric splits according to g = \u03b2dT 2 \u2212h with a temporal function T : IR\u00d7\u03a3 \u2192 IR\nand a positive function \u03b2 \u2208 C \u221e (IR \u00d7 \u03a3, (0, \u221e)), while h induces a smooth Riemannian\nmetric on \u03a3 [BS05, Thm. 2.1]. We assume that, with E as in (2.2), the Cauchy surface\n\u03a3 is smoothly homeomorphic to a product manifold I \u00d7 E, where I is an open interval\nor the full real line. Thus M \u223c\n= IR \u00d7 I \u00d7 E, and we require in addition that there exists\na smooth embedding \u03b9 : IR \u00d7 I \u2192 M . By our assumption on the topology of I, it follows\nthat (IR \u00d7 I, \u03b9\u2217 g) is a globally hyperbolic spacetime without null focal points, a feature\nthat we will need in the subsequent construction of wedge regions.\nDefinition 2.1 A spacetime (M, g) is called admissible if it admits two linearly independent, spacelike, complete, commuting, smooth Killing fields \u03be1 , \u03be2 and the corresponding\nsplit M \u223c\n= IR \u00d7 I \u00d7 E, with E defined in (2.2), has the properties described above.\nThe set of all ordered pairs \u03be := (\u03be1 , \u03be2 ) satisfying these conditions for a given admissible spacetime (M, g) is denoted \u039e(M, g). The elements of \u039e(M, g) will be referred\nto as Killing pairs.\nFor the remainder of this section, we will work with an arbitrary but fixed admissible\nspacetime (M, g), and usually drop the (M, g)-dependence of various objects in our\nnotation, e.g., write \u039e instead of \u039e(M, g) for the set of Killing pairs, and Iso in place\nof Iso(M, g) for the isometry group. Concrete examples of admissible spacetimes, such\nas Friedmann-Robertson-Walker-, Kasner- and Bianchi-spacetimes, will be discussed in\nSection 2.2.\nThe flow of a Killing pair \u03be \u2208 \u039e is written as\n\u03be = (\u03be1 , \u03be2 ) \u2208 \u039e, s = (s1 , s2 ) \u2208 IR2 ,\n\n\u03c6\u03be,s := \u03c6\u03be1 ,s1 \u25e6 \u03c6\u03be2 ,s2 = \u03c6\u03be2 ,s2 \u25e6 \u03c6\u03be1 ,s1 ,\n4\n\n(2.3)\n\n\fwhere s1 , s2 \u2208 IR are the parameters of the (complete) flows \u03c6\u03be1 , \u03c6\u03be2 of \u03be1 , \u03be2 . By\nconstruction, each \u03c6\u03be is an isometric IR2 -action by diffeomorphisms on (M, g), i.e.,\n\u03c6\u03be,s \u2208 Iso and \u03c6\u03be,s \u03c6\u03be,u = \u03c6\u03be,s+u for all s, u \u2208 IR2 .\nOn the set \u039e, the isometry group Iso and the general linear group GL(2, IR) act in a\nnatural manner.\nLemma 2.2 Let h \u2208 Iso, N \u2208 GL(2, IR), and define, \u03be = (\u03be1 , \u03be2 ) \u2208 \u039e,\nh\u2217 \u03be := (h\u2217 \u03be1 , h\u2217 \u03be2 ) ,\n(N \u03be)(p) := N (\u03be1 (p), \u03be2 (p)) ,\n\np\u2208M.\n\n(2.4)\n(2.5)\n\nThese operations are commuting group actions of Iso and GL(2, IR) on \u039e, respectively.\nThe GL(2, IR)-action transforms the flow of \u03be \u2208 \u039e according to, s \u2208 IR2 ,\n\u03c6N \u03be,s = \u03c6\u03be,N T s .\n\n(2.6)\n\nIf h\u2217 \u03be = N \u03be for some \u03be \u2208 \u039e, h \u2208 Iso, N \u2208 GL(2, IR), then det N = \u00b11.\nProof: Due to the standard properties of isometries, Iso acts on the Lie algebra of\nKilling fields by the push-forward isomorphisms \u03be1 7\u2192 h\u2217 \u03be1 [O'N83]. Therefore, for\nany (\u03be1 , \u03be2 ) \u2208 \u039e, also the vector fields h\u2217 \u03be1 , h\u2217 \u03be2 are spacelike, complete, commuting,\nlinearly independent, smooth Killing fields. The demanded properties of the splitting\nM \u223c\n= IR \u00d7 I \u00d7 E directly carry over to the corresponding split with respect to h\u2217 \u03be. So\nh\u2217 maps \u039e onto \u039e, and since h\u2217 (k\u2217 \u03be1 ) = (hk)\u2217 \u03be1 for h, k \u2208 Iso, we have an action of Iso.\nThe second map, \u03be 7\u2192 N \u03be, amounts to taking linear combinations of the Killing fields\n\u03be1 , \u03be2 . The relation (2.6) holds because \u03be1 , \u03be2 commute and are complete, which entails\nthat the respective flows can be constructed via the exponential map. Since det N 6= 0,\nthe two components of N \u03be are still linearly independent, and since E (2.2) is invariant\nunder \u03be 7\u2192 N \u03be, the splitting M \u223c\n= IR \u00d7 I \u00d7 E is the same for \u03be and N \u03be. Hence N \u03be \u2208 \u039e,\ni.e., \u03be 7\u2192 N \u03be is a GL(2, IR)-action on \u039e, and since the push-forward is linear, it is clear\nthat the two actions commute.\nTo prove the last statement, we consider the submanifold E (2.2) together with its\ninduced metric. Since the Killing fields \u03be1 , \u03be2 are tangent to E, their flows are isometries\nof E. Since h\u2217 \u03be = N \u03be and E is two-dimensional, it follows that N acts as an isometry\non the tangent space Tp E, p \u2208 E. But as E is spacelike and two-dimensional, we can\nassume without loss of generality that the metric of Tp E is the Euclidean metric, and\ntherefore has the two-dimensional Euclidean group E(2) as its isometry group. Thus\nN \u2208 GL(2, IR) \u2229 E(2) = O(2), i.e., det N = \u00b11.\n\u0003\n\u0001\nThe GL(2, IR)-transformation given by the flip matrix \u03a0 := 01 10 will play a special\nrole later on. We therefore reserve the name inverted Killing pair of \u03be = (\u03be1 , \u03be2 ) \u2208 \u039e for\n\u03be 0 := \u03a0\u03be = (\u03be2 , \u03be1 ) .\n\n(2.7)\n\nNote that since we consider ordered tuples (\u03be1 , \u03be2 ), the Killing pairs \u03be and \u03be 0 are not\nidentical. Clearly, the map \u03be 7\u2192 \u03be 0 is an involution on \u039e, i.e., (\u03be 0 )0 = \u03be.\nAfter these preparations, we turn to the construction of wedge regions in M , and begin\nby specifying their edges.\n5\n\n\fDefinition 2.3 An edge is a subset of M which has the form\nE\u03be,p := {\u03c6\u03be,s (p) \u2208 M : s \u2208 IR2 }\n\n(2.8)\n\nfor some \u03be \u2208 \u039e, p \u2208 M . Any spacelike vector n\u03be,p \u2208 Tp M which completes the gradient of\nthe chosen temporal function and the Killing vectors \u03be1 (p), \u03be2 (p) to a positively oriented\nbasis (\u2207T (p), \u03be1 (p), \u03be2 (p), n\u03be,p ) of Tp M is called an oriented normal of E\u03be,p .\nIt is clear from this definition that each edge is a two-dimensional, spacelike, smooth\nsubmanifold of M . Our definition of admissible spacetimes M \u223c\n= IR \u00d7 I \u00d7 E explicitly\nrestricts the topology of I, but not of the edge (2.2), which can be homeomorphic to a\nplane, cylinder, or torus.\nNote also that the description of the edge E\u03be,p in terms of \u03be and p is somewhat redundant: Replacing the Killing fields \u03be1 , \u03be2 by linear combinations \u03be \u0303 := N \u03be, N \u2208 GL(2, IR),\nor replacing p by p\u0303 := \u03c6\u03be,u (p) with some u \u2208 IR2 , results in the same manifold E\u03be\u0303,p\u0303 = E\u03be,p .\nBefore we define wedges as connected components of causal complements of edges, we\nhave to prove the following key lemma, from which the relevant properties of wedges follow. For its proof, it might be helpful to visualize the geometrical situation as sketched\nin Figure 1.\n\nFigure 1: Three-dimensional sketch of the wedge W\u03be,p and its edge E\u03be,p\n0\nLemma 2.4 The causal complement E\u03be,p\nof an edge E\u03be,p is the disjoint union of two\nconnected components, which are causal complements of each other.\n\n0\nProof: We first show that any point q \u2208 E\u03be,p\nis connected to the base point p by a smooth,\nspacelike curve. Since M is globally hyperbolic, there exist Cauchy surfaces \u03a3p , \u03a3q\npassing through p and q, respectively. We pick two compact subsets Kq \u2282 \u03a3q , containing\nq, and Kp \u2282 \u03a3p , containing p. If Kp , Kq are chosen sufficiently small, their union Kp \u222aKq\nis an acausal, compact, codimension one submanifold of M . It thus fulfils the hypothesis\nof Thm. 1.1 in [BS06], which guarantees that there exists a spacelike Cauchy surface\n\u03a3 containing the said union. In particular, there exists a smooth, spacelike curve \u03b3\nconnecting p = \u03b3(0) and q = \u03b3(1). Picking spacelike vectors v \u2208 Tp \u03a3 and w \u2208 Tq \u03a3, we\n\n6\n\n\fhave the freedom of choosing \u03b3 in such a way that \u03b3\u0307(0) = v and \u03b3\u0307(1) = w. If v and\nw are chosen linearly independent from \u03be1 (p), \u03be2 (p) and \u03be1 (q), \u03be2 (q), respectively, these\nvectors are oriented normals of E\u03be,p respectively E\u03be,q , and we can select \u03b3 such that it\nintersects the edge E\u03be,p only in p.\nLet us define the region\n0\n: \u2203 \u03b3 \u2208 C 1 ([0, 1], M ) with \u03b3(0) = p, \u03b3(1) = q, E\u03be,p \u2229 \u03b3 = {p},\nW\u03be,p := {q \u2208 E\u03be,p\n\n\u03b3\u0307(0) is an oriented normal of E\u03be,p , \u03b3\u0307(1) is an oriented normal of E\u03be,q } , (2.9)\nand, exchanging \u03be with the inverted Killing pair \u03be 0 , we correspondingly define the region\n0\n, and that we can\nW\u03be0 ,p . It is clear from the above argument that W\u03be,p \u222a W\u03be0 ,p = E\u03be,p\nprescribe arbitrary normals n, m of E\u03be,p , E\u03be,q as initial respectively final tangent vectors\nof the curve \u03b3 connecting p to q \u2208 W\u03be,p .\nThe proof of the lemma consists in establishing that W\u03be,p and W\u03be0 ,p are disjoint, and\ncausal complements of each other. To prove disjointness of W\u03be,p , W\u03be0 ,p , assume there\nexists a point q \u2208 W\u03be,p \u2229 W\u03be0 ,p . Then q can be connected with the base point p by two\nspacelike curves, whose tangent vectors satisfy the conditions in (2.9) with \u03be respectively\n0\n\u03be 0 . By joining these two curves, we have identified a continuous loop \u03bb in E\u03be,p\n. As an\noriented normal, the tangent vector \u03bb\u0307(0) at p is linearly independent of \u03be1 (p), \u03be2 (p), so\nthat \u03bb intersects E\u03be,p only in p.\nRecall that according to Definition 2.1, M splits as the product M \u223c\n= IR \u00d7 I \u00d7 E\u03be,p ,\nwith an open interval I which is smoothly embedded in M . Hence we can consider\nthe projection \u03c0(\u03bb) of the loop \u03bb onto I, which is a closed interval \u03c0(\u03bb) \u2282 I because\nthe simple connectedness of I rules out the possibility that \u03c0(\u03bb) forms a loop, and on\naccount of the linear independence of {\u03be1 (p), \u03be2 (p), n\u03be,p }, the projection cannot be just\na single point. Yet, as \u03bb is a loop, there exists p0 \u2208 \u03bb such that \u03c0(p0 ) = \u03c0(p). We also\nknow that \u03c0 \u22121 ({\u03c0(p)}) = IR \u00d7 {\u03c0(p)} \u00d7 E\u03be,p is contained in J + (E\u03be,p ) \u222a E\u03be,p \u222a J \u2212 (E\u03be,p )\nand, since p and p0 are causally separated, the only possibility left is that they both lie\non the same edge. Yet, per construction, we know that the loop intersects the edge only\nonce at p and, thus, p and p0 must coincide, which is the sought contradiction.\nTo verify the claim about causal complements, assume there exist points q \u2208 W\u03be,p ,\n0\nq \u2208 W\u03be0 ,p and a causal curve \u03b3 connecting them, \u03b3(0) = q, \u03b3(1) = q 0 . By definition of the\ncausal complement, it is clear that \u03b3 does not intersect E\u03be,p . In view of our restriction\non the topology of M , it follows that \u03b3 intersects either J + (E\u03be,p ) or J \u2212 (E\u03be,p ). These\ntwo cases are completely analogous, and we consider the latter one, where there exists\na point q 00 \u2208 \u03b3 \u2229 J \u2212 (E\u03be,p ). In this situation, we have a causal curve connecting q \u2208 W\u03be,p\nwith q 00 \u2208 J \u2212 (E\u03be,p ), and since q \u2208\n/ J \u2212 (q 00 ) \u2282 J \u2212 (E\u03be,p ), it follows that \u03b3 must be past\ndirected. As the time orientation of \u03b3 is the same for the whole curve, it follows that\nalso the part of \u03b3 connecting q 00 and q 0 is past directed. Hence q 0 \u2208 J \u2212 (q 00 ) \u2282 J \u2212 (E\u03be,p ),\nwhich is a contradiction to q 0 \u2208 W\u03be0 ,p . Thus W\u03be0 ,p \u2282 W\u03be,p 0 .\n0\n0\n= W\u03be,p t W\u03be0 ,p .\nTo show that W\u03be0 ,p coincides with W\u03be,p 0 , let q \u2208 W\u03be,p 0 = W\u03be,p \u2282 E\u03be,p\n0\nYet q \u2208 W\u03be,p is not possible since q \u2208 W\u03be,p and W\u03be,p is open. So q \u2208 W\u03be0 ,p , i.e., we have\nshown W\u03be,p 0 \u2282 W\u03be0 ,p , and the claimed identity W\u03be0 ,p = W\u03be,p 0 follows.\n\u0003\n7\n\n\fLemma 2.4 does not hold if the topological requirements on M are dropped. As an example, consider\na cylinder universe IR \u00d7 S 1 \u00d7 IR2 , the product of the\nLorentz cylinder IR \u00d7 S 1 [O'N83] and the Euclidean\nplane IR2 . The translations in the last factor IR2 define spacelike, complete, commuting, linearly independent Killing fields \u03be. Yet the causal complement of the\nedge E\u03be,p = {0} \u00d7 {1} \u00d7 IR2 has only a single connected component, which has empty causal complement.\nIn this situation, wedges lose many of the useful properties which we establish below for admissible spacetimes.\n\n0\nE\u03be,p\nin a Lorentz cylinder\n\nIn view of Lemma 2.4, wedges in M can be defined as follows.\nDefinition 2.5 (Wedges)\nA wedge is a subset of M which is a connected component of the causal complement of\n0\nwhich\nan edge in M . Given \u03be \u2208 \u039e, p \u2208 M , we denote by W\u03be,p the component of E\u03be,p\nintersects the curves \u03b3(t) := expp (t n\u03be,p ), t > 0, for any oriented normal n\u03be,p of E\u03be,p .\nThe family of all wedges is denoted\nW := {W\u03be,p : \u03be \u2208 \u039e, p \u2208 M } .\n\n(2.10)\n\nAs explained in the proof of Lemma 2.4, the condition that the curve IR+ 3 t 7\u2192\n0\nis independent of the chosen normal\nexpp (t n\u03be,p ) intersects a connected component of E\u03be,p\n0\nn\u03be,p , and each such curve intersects precisely one of the two components of E\u03be,p\n.\nSome properties of wedges which immediately follow from the construction carried\nout in the proof of Lemma 2.4 are listed in the following proposition.\nProposition 2.6 (Properties of wedges)\nLet W = W\u03be,p be a wedge. Then\na) W is causally complete, i.e., W 00 = W , and hence globally hyperbolic.\nb) The causal complement of a wedge is given by inverting its Killing pair,\n(W\u03be,p )0 = W\u03be0 ,p .\n\n(2.11)\n\nc) A wedge is invariant under the Killing flow generating its edge,\n\u03c6\u03be,s (W\u03be,p ) = W\u03be,p ,\n\ns \u2208 IR2 .\n\n(2.12)\n\nProof: a) By Lemma 2.4, W is the causal complement of another wedge V , and therefore\ncausally complete: W 00 = V 000 = V 0 = W . Since M is globally hyperbolic, this implies\nthat W is globally hyperbolic, too [Key96, Prop. 12.5].\nb) This statement has already been checked in the proof of Lemma 2.4.\n8\n\n\fc) By definition of the edge E\u03be,p (2.8), we have \u03c6\u03be,s (E\u03be,p ) = E\u03be,p for any s \u2208 IR2 ,\n0\n0\n. Continuity of the flow\n) = E\u03be,p\nand since the \u03c6\u03be,s are isometries, it follows that \u03c6\u03be,s (E\u03be,p\nimplies that also the two connected components of this set are invariant.\n\u0003\n\nCorollary 2.7 (Properties of the family of wedge regions)\nThe family W of wedge regions is invariant under the isometry group Iso and under\ntaking causal complements. For h \u2208 Iso, it holds\nh(W\u03be,p ) = Wh\u2217 \u03be,h(p) .\n\n(2.13)\n\nProof: Since isometries preserve the causal structure of a spacetime, we only need to\nlook at the action of isometries on edges. We find\nhE\u03be,p = {h \u25e6 \u03c6\u03be,s \u25e6 h\u22121 (h(p)) : s \u2208 IR2 } = {\u03c6h\u2217 \u03be,s (h(p)) : s \u2208 IR2 } = Eh\u2217 \u03be,h(p)\n\n(2.14)\n\nby using the well-known fact that conjugation of flows by isometries amounts to the\npush-forward by the isometry of the associated vector field. Since h\u2217 \u03be \u2208 \u039e for any\n\u03be \u2208 \u039e, h \u2208 Iso (Lemma 2.2), the family W is invariant under the action of the isometry\ngroup. Closedness of W under causal complementation is clear from Prop. 2.6 b). \u0003\nIn contrast to the situation in flat spacetime, the isometry group Iso does not act\ntransitively on W(M, g) for generic admissible M , and there is no isometry mapping a\ngiven wedge onto its causal complement. This can be seen explicitly in the examples\ndiscussed in Section 2.2. To keep track of this structure of W(M, g), we decompose\n\u039e(M, g) into orbits under the Iso- and GL(2, IR)-actions.\n \u0303 if there exist\nDefinition 2.8 Two Killing pairs \u03be, \u03be \u0303 \u2208 \u039e are equivalent, written \u03be \u223c \u03be,\nh \u2208 Iso and N \u2208 GL(2, IR) such that \u03be \u0303 = N h\u2217 \u03be.\nAs \u03be 7\u2192 N \u03be and \u03be 7\u2192 h\u2217 \u03be are commuting group actions, \u223c is an equivalence relation.\nAccording to Lemma 2.2 and Prop. 2.6 b), c), acting with N \u2208 GL(2, IR) on \u03be either\nleaves WN \u03be,p = W\u03be,p invariant (if det N > 0) or exchanges this wedge with its causal\n0\ncomplement, WN \u03be,p = W\u03be,p\n(if det N < 0).

The wedges W\u03be,p and W\u03be\u0303,p\u0303 form an inclusion, W\u03be,p \u2282 W\u03be\u0303,p\u0303 , if\nand only if p \u2208 W\u03be\u0303,p\u0303 and there exists N \u2208 GL(2, IR) with det N > 0, such that \u03be \u0303 = N \u03be.\nProof: (\u21d0) Let us assume that \u03be \u0303 = N \u03be holds for some N \u2208 GL(2, IR) with det N > 0,\nand p \u2208 W\u03be\u0303,p\u0303 . In this case, the Killing fields in \u03be \u0303 are linear combinations of those in \u03be,\nand consequently, the edges E\u03be,p and E\u03be\u0303,p\u0303 intersect if and only if they coincide, i.e. if\np\u0303 \u2208 E\u03be,p . If the edges coincide, we clearly have W\u03be\u0303,p\u0303 = W\u03be,p . If they do not coincide, it\nfollows from p \u2208 W\u03be\u0303,p\u0303 that E\u03be,p and E\u03be\u0303,p\u0303 are either spacelike separated or they can be\nconnected by a null geodesic.\nConsider now the case that E\u03be,p and E\u03be\u0303,p\u0303 are spacelike separated, i.e. p \u2208 W\u03be\u0303,p\u0303 . Pick\na point q \u2208 W\u03be,p and recall that W\u03be,p can be characterized by equation (2.9). Since\np \u2208 W\u03be\u0303,p\u0303 and q \u2208 W\u03be,p , there exist curves \u03b3p and \u03b3q , which connect the pairs of points\n(p\u0303, p) and (p, q), respectively, and comply with the conditions in (2.9). By joining \u03b3p\nand \u03b3q we obtain a curve which connects p\u0303 and q. The tangent vectors \u03b3\u0307p (1) and \u03b3\u0307q (0)\nare oriented normals of E\u03be,p and we choose \u03b3p and \u03b3q in such a way that these tangent\nvectors coincide. Due to the properties of \u03b3p and \u03b3q , the joint curve also complies with\nthe conditions in (2.9), from which we conclude q \u2208 W\u03be\u0303,p\u0303 , and thus W\u03be,p \u2282 W\u03be\u0303,p\u0303 .\nConsider now the case that E\u03be\u0303,p\u0303 and E\u03be,p are connected by null geodesics, i.e. p \u2208\n\u2202W\u03be\u0303,p\u0303 . Let r be the point in E\u03be,p which can be connected by a null geodesic with p\u0303 and\npick a point q \u2208 W\u03be,p . The intersection J \u2212 (r) \u2229 \u2202W\u03be,p yields another null curve, say \u03bc,\nand the intersection \u03bc \u2229 J \u2212 (q) =: p0 is non-empty since r and q are spacelike separated\nand q \u2208 W\u03be,p . The null curve \u03bc is chosen future directed and parametrized in such a way\nthat \u03bc(0) = p0 and \u03bc(1) = r. By taking \u03b5 \u2208 (0, 1) we find q \u2208 W\u03be,\u03bc(\u03b5) and \u03bc(\u03b5) \u2208 W\u03be\u0303,p\u0303\nwhich entails q \u2208 W\u03be\u0303,p\u0303 .\n(\u21d2) Let us assume that we have an inclusion of wedges W\u03be,p \u2282 W\u03be\u0303,p\u0303 . Then clearly\np \u2208 W\u03be\u0303,p\u0303 . Since M is four-dimensional and \u03be1 , \u03be2 , \u03be \u03031 , \u03be \u03032 are all spacelike, they cannot be\nlinearly independent. Let us first assume that three of them are linearly independent,\nand without loss of generality, let \u03be = (\u03be1 , \u03be2 ) and \u03be \u0303 = (\u03be2 , \u03be3 ) with three linearly\nindependent spacelike Killing fields \u03be1 , \u03be2 , \u03be3 . Picking points q \u2208 E\u03be,p , q\u0303 \u2208 E\u03be\u0303,p\u0303 these can\nbe written as q = (t, x1 , x2 , x3 ) and q\u0303 = (t\u0303, x\u03031 , x\u03032 , x\u03033 ) in the global coordinate system of\nflow parameters constructed from \u03be1 , \u03be2 , \u03be3 and the gradient of the temporal function.\nFor suitable flow parameters s1 , s2 , s3 , we have \u03c6\u03be1 ,s1 (q) = (t, x\u03031 , x2 , x3 ) =: q 0 \u2208 E\u03be,p\nand \u03c6(\u03be2 ,\u03be3 ),(s2 ,s3 ) (q\u0303) = (t\u0303, x\u03031 , x2 , x3 ) =: q\u0303 0 \u2208 E\u03be\u0303,p\u0303 . Clearly, the points q 0 and q\u0303 0 are\nconnected by a timelike curve, e.g. the curve whose tangent vector field is given by\nthe gradient of the temporal function. But a timelike curve connecting the edges of\nW\u03be,p , W\u03be\u0303,p\u0303 is a contradiction to these wedges forming an inclusion. So no three of the\nvector fields \u03be1 , \u03be2 , \u03be \u03031 , \u03be \u03032 can be linearly independent.\n10\n\n\fHence \u03be \u0303 = N \u03be with an invertible matrix N . It remains to establish the correct sign\nof det N , and to this end, we assume det N < 0. Then we have (W\u03be,p )0 = W\u03be0 ,p \u2282 W\u03be\u0303,p\u0303 ,\nby (Prop. 2.6 b)) and the (\u21d0) statement in this proof, since \u03be \u0303 and \u03be 0 are related by a\npositive determinant transformation and p \u2208 W\u03be\u0303,p\u0303 . This yields that both, W\u03be,p and its\ncausal complement, must be contained in W\u03be\u0303,p\u0303 , a contradiction. Hence det N > 0, and\nthe proof is finished.\n\u0003\nHaving derived the structural properties of the set W of wedges needed later, we now\ncompare our wedge regions to the Minkowski wedges and to other definitions proposed\nin the literature.\nThe flat Minkowski spacetime (IR4 , \u03b7) clearly belongs to the class of admissible spacetimes, with translations along spacelike directions and rotations in the standard time\nzero Cauchy surface as its complete spacelike Killing fields. However, as Killing pairs\nconsist of non-vanishing vector fields, and each rotation leaves its rotation axis invariant,\nthe set \u039e(IR4 , \u03b7) consists precisely of all pairs (\u03be1 , \u03be2 ) such that the flows \u03c6\u03be1 , \u03c6\u03be2 are\ntranslations along two linearly independent spacelike directions. Hence the set of all\nedges in Minkowski space coincides with the set of all two-dimensional spacelike planes.\nConsequently, each wedge W \u2208 W(IR4 , \u03b7) is bounded by two non-parallel characteristic\nthree-dimensional planes. This is precisely the family of wedges usually considered in\nMinkowski space2 (see, for example, [TW97]).\nBesides the features we established above in the general admissible setting, the family\nof Minkowski wedges has the following well-known properties:\na) Each wedge W \u2208 W(IR4 , \u03b7) is the causal completion of the world line of a uniformly\naccelerated observer.\nb) Each wedge W \u2208 W(IR4 , \u03b7) is the union of a family of double cones whose tips lie\non two fixed lightrays.\nc) The isometry group (the Poincar\u00e9 group) acts transitively on W(IR4 , \u03b7).\nd) W(IR4 , \u03b7) is causally separating in the sense that given any two spacelike separated\ndouble cones O1 , O2 \u2282 IR4 , then there exists a wedge W such that O1 \u2282 W \u2282 O20\n[TW97]. W(IR4 , \u03b7) is a subbase for the topology of IR4 .\nAll these properties a)\u2013d) do not hold for the class W(M, g) of wedges on a general\nadmissible spacetime, but some hold for certain subclasses, as can be seen from the\nexplicit examples in the subsequent section.\nThere exist a number of different constructions for wedges in curved spacetimes in the\nliterature, mostly for special manifolds. On de Sitter respectively anti de Sitter space\nBorchers and Buchholz [BB99] respectively Buchholz and Summers [BS04] construct\n2\nNote that we would get a \"too large\" family of wedges in Minkowski space if we would drop the\nrequirement that the vector fields generating edges are Killing. However, the assumption that edges\nare generated by commuting Killing fields is motivated by the application to deformations of quantum\nfield theories, and one could generalize our framework to spacetimes with edges generated by complete,\nlinearly independent smooth Killing fields.\n\n11\n\n\fwedges by taking property a) as their defining feature, see also the generalization by\nStrich [Str08]. In the de Sitter case, this definition is equivalent to our definition of a\nwedge as a connected component of the causal complement of an edge [BMS01]. But\nas two-dimensional spheres, the de Sitter edges do not admit two linearly independent\ncommuting Killing fields. Apart from this difference due to our restriction to commuting,\nlinearly independent, Killing fields, the de Sitter wedges can be constructed in the same\nway as presented here. Thanks to the maximal symmetry of the de Sitter and anti de\nSitter spacetimes, the respective isometry groups act transitively on the corresponding\nwedge families (c), and causally separate in the sense of d).\nA definition related to the previous examples has been given by Lauridsen-Ribeiro\nfor wedges in asymptotically anti de Sitter spacetimes (see Def. 1.5 in [LR07]). Note\nthat these spacetimes are not admissible in our sense since anti de Sitter space is not\nglobally hyperbolic.\nProperty b) has recently been taken by Borchers [Bor09] as a definition of wedges\nin a quite general class of curved spacetimes which is closely related to the structure of\ndouble cones. In that setting, wedges do not exhibit in general all of the features we\nderived in our framework, and can for example have compact closure.\nWedges in a class of Friedmann-Robertson-Walker spacetimes with spherical spatial\nsections have been constructed with the help of conformal embeddings into de Sitter\nspace [BMS01]. This construction also yields wedges defined as connected components\nof causal complements of edges. Here a) does not, but c) and d) do hold, see also our\ndiscussion of Friedmann-Robertson-Walker spacetimes with flat spatial sections in the\nnext section.\nThe idea of constructing wedges as connected components of causal complements\nof specific two-dimensional submanifolds has also been used in the context of globally\nhyperbolic spacetimes with a bifurcate Killing horizon [GLRV01], building on earlier\nwork in [Kay85]. Here the edge is given as the fixed point manifold of the Killing flow\nassociated with the horizon.\n\n2.2\n\nConcrete examples\n\nIn the previous section we provided a complete but abstract characterization of the\ngeometric structures of the class of spacetimes we are interested in. This analysis is now\ncomplemented by presenting a number of explicit examples of admissible spacetimes.\nThe easiest way to construct an admissble spacetime is to take the warped product\n[O'N83, Chap. 7] of an edge with another manifold. Let (E, gE ) be a two-dimensional\nRiemannian manifold endowed with two complete, commuting, linearly independent,\nsmooth Killing fields, and let (X, gX ) be a two-dimensional, globally hyperbolic spacetime diffeomorphic to IR \u00d7 I, with I an open interval or the full real line. Then, given a\npositive smooth function f on X, consider the warped product M := X \u00d7f E, i.e., the\nproduct manifold X \u00d7 E endowed with the metric tensor field\n\u2217\ng := \u03c0X\n(gX ) + (f \u25e6 \u03c0X ) * \u03c0E\u2217 (gE ),\n\nwhere \u03c0X : M \u2192 X and \u03c0E : M \u2192 E are the projections on X and E. It readily follows\nthat (M, g) is admissible in the sense of Definition 2.1.\n12\n\n\fThe following proposition describes an explicit class of admissible spacetimes in terms\nof their metrics.\nProposition 2.10 Let (M, g) be a spacetime diffeomorphic to IR \u00d7 I \u00d7 IR2 , where I \u2286\nIR is open and simply connected, endowed with a global coordinate system (t, x, y, z)\naccording to which the metric reads\nds2 = e2f0 dt2 \u2212 e2f1 dx2 \u2212 e2f2 dy 2 \u2212 e2f3 (dz \u2212 q dy)2 .\n\n(2.17)\n\nHere t runs over the whole IR, fi , q \u2208 C \u221e (M ) for i = 0, ..., 3 and fi , q do not depend on\ny and z. Then (M, g) is an admissible spacetime in the sense of Definition 2.1.\nProof: Per direct inspection of (2.17), M is isometric to IR \u00d7 \u03a3 with \u03a3 \u223c\n= I \u00d7 IR2 with\nds2 = \u03b2 dt2 \u2212hij dxi dxj , where \u03b2 is smooth and positive, and h is a metric which depends\nsmoothly on t. Furthermore, on the hypersurfaces at constant t, det h = e2(f1 +f2 +f3 ) > 0\nand h is block-diagonal. If we consider the sub-matrix with i, j = y, z, this has a positive\ndeterminant and a positive trace. Hence we can conclude that the induced metric on \u03a3 is\nRiemannian, or, in other words, \u03a3 is a spacelike, smooth, three-dimensional Riemannian\nhypersurface. Therefore we can apply Theorem 1.1 in [BS05] to conclude that M is\nglobally hyperbolic.\nSince the metric coefficients are independent from y and z, the vector fields \u03be1 = \u2202y\nand \u03be2 = \u2202z are smooth Killing fields which commute and, as they lie tangent to the\nRiemannian hypersurfaces at constant time, they are also spacelike. Furthermore, since\nper definition of spacetime, M and thus also \u03a3 is connected, we can invoke the HopfRinow-Theorem [O'N83, \u00a7 5, Thm. 21] to conclude that \u03a3 is complete and, thus, all\nits Killing fields are complete. As I is simply connected by assumption, it follows that\n(M, g) is admissible.\n\u0003\nUnder an additional assumption, also a partial converse of Proposition 2.10 is true.\nNamely, let (M, g) be a globally hyperbolic spacetime with two complete, spacelike, commuting, smooth Killing fields, and pick a local coordinate system (t, x, y, z), where y and\nz are the flow parameters of the Killing fields. Then, if the reflection map r : M \u2192 M ,\nr(t, x, y, z) = (t, x, \u2212y, \u2212z), is an isometry, the metric is locally of the form (2.17), as\nwas proven in [Cha83, CF84]. The reflection r is used to guarantee the vanishing of\nthe unwanted off-diagonal metric coefficients, namely those associated to \"dx dy\" and\n\"dx dz\". Notice that the cited papers allow only to establish a result on the local structure of M and no a priori condition is imposed on the topology of I, in distinction to\nProposition 2.10.\nSome of the metrics (2.17) are used in cosmology. For the description of a spatially\nhomogeneous but in general anisotropic universe M \u223c\n= J \u00d7 IR3 where J \u2286 IR (see \u00a75 in\n[Wal84] and [FPH74]), one puts f0 = q = 0 in (2.17) and takes f1 , f2 , f3 to depend only\non t. This yields the metric of Kasner spacetimes respectively Bianchi I models3\nds2 = dt2 \u2212 e2f1 dx2 \u2212 e2f2 dy 2 \u2212 e2f3 dz 2 .\n3\n\n(2.18)\n\nThe Bianchi models I\u2013IX [Ell06] arise from the classification of three-dimensional real Lie algebras,\n\n13\n\n\fClearly here the isometry group contains three smooth Killing fields, locally given by\n\u2202x , \u2202y , \u2202z , which are everywhere linearly independent, complete and commuting. In particular, (\u2202x , \u2202y ), (\u2202x , \u2202z ) and (\u2202y , \u2202z ) are Killing pairs.\nA case of great physical relevance arises when specializing the metric further by taking\nall the functions fi in (2.18) to coincide. In this case, the metric assumes the so-called\nFriedmann-Robertson-Walker form\n\u0002\n\u0003\nds2 = dt2 \u2212 a(t)2 [dx2 + dy 2 + dz 2 ] = a(t(\u03c4 ))2 d\u03c4 2 \u2212 dx2 \u2212 dy 2 \u2212 dz 2 .\n\n(2.19)\n\nHere the scale factor a(t) := ef1 (t) is defined on some interval J \u2286 IR, and in the\nsecond equality, we have introduced the conformal time \u03c4 , which is implicitely defined\nby d\u03c4 = a\u22121 (t)dt. Notice that, as in the Bianchi I model, the manifold is M \u223c\n= J \u00d7 IR3 ,\ni.e., the variable t does not need to range over the whole real axis. (This does not affect\nthe property of global hyperbolicity.)\nBy inspection of (2.19), it is clear that the isometry group of this spacetime contains\nthe three-dimensional Euclidean group E(3) = O(3) o IR3 . Disregarding the Minkowski\ncase, where J = IR and a is constant, the isometry group in fact coincides with E(3).\nEdges in such a Friedmann-Robertson-Walker universe are of the form {\u03c4 }\u00d7S, where S is\na two-dimensional plane in IR3 and t(\u03c4 ) \u2208 J. Here W consists of a single coherent family,\nand the Iso-orbits in W are labelled by the time parameter \u03c4 for the corresponding edges.\nAlso note that the family of Friedmann-Robertson-Walker wedges is causally separating\nin the sense discussed on page 11.\nThe second form of the metric in (2.19) is manifestly a conformal rescaling of the\nflat Minkowski metric. Interpreting the coordinates (\u03c4, x, y, z) as coordinates of a point\nin IR4 therefore gives rise to a conformal embedding \u03b9 : M \u2192 IR4 .\nIn this situation, it is interesting to note that the\nset of all images \u03b9(E) of edges E in the FriedmannRobertson-Walker spacetime coincides with the set\nof all Minkowski space edges which lie completely\nin \u03b9(M ) = J \u00d7 IR3 , provided that J does not coincide with IR. These are just the edges parallel\nto the standard Cauchy surfaces of constant \u03c4 in\nIR4 . So Friedmann-Robertson-Walker edges can\nalso be characterized in terms of Minkowski space\nTwo wedges in FRW spacetime\nedges and the conformal embedding \u03b9, analogous\nto the construction of wedges in Friedmann-Robertson-Walker spacetimes with spherical\nspatial sections in [BMS01].\n\nthought of as Lie subalgebras of the Lie algebra of Killing fields. Only the cases Bianchi I\u2013VII, in which\nthe three-dimensional Lie algebra contains IR2 as a subalgebra, are of direct interest here, since only in\nthese cases Killing pairs exist.\n\n14\n\n\f3\n\nQuantum field theories on admissible spacetimes\n\nHaving discussed the relevant geometric structures, we now fix an admissible spacetime\n(M, g) and discuss warped convolution deformations of quantum field theories on it. For\nmodels on flat Minkowski space, it is known that this deformation procedure weakens\npoint-like localization to localization in wedges [BLS10], and we will show here that\nthe same holds true for admissible curved spacetimes. For a convenient description of\nthis weakened form of localization, and for a straightforward application of the warped\nconvolution technique, we will work in the framework of local quantum physics [Haa96].\nIn this setting, a model theory is defined by a net of field algebras, and here we\nconsider algebras F(W ) of quantum fields supported in wedges W \u2208 W(M, g). The\nmain idea underlying the deformation is to apply the formalism developed in [BS08,\nBLS10], but with the global translation symmetries of Minkowski space replaced by\nthe Killing flow \u03c6\u03be corresponding to the wedge W = W\u03be,p under consideration. In the\ncase of Minkowski spacetime, these deformations reduce to the familiar structure of a\nnoncommutative Minkowski space with commuting time.\nThe details of the model under consideration will not be important in Section 3.1,\nsince our construction relies only on a few structural properties satisfied in any wellbehaved quantum field theory. In Section 3.2, the deformed Dirac quantum field is\npresented as a particular example.\n\n3.1\n\nDeformations of nets with Killing symmetries\n\nProceeding to the standard mathematical formalism [Haa96, Ara99], we consider a C \u2217 algebra F, whose elements are interpreted as (bounded functions of) quantum fields on\nthe spacetime M . The field algebra F has a local structure, and in the present context,\nwe focus on localization in wedges W \u2208 W, since this form of localization turns out\nto be stable under the deformation. Therefore, corresponding to each wedge W \u2208 W,\nwe consider the C \u2217 -subalgebra F(W ) \u2282 F of fields supported in W . Furthermore, we\nassume a strongly continuous action \u03b1 of the isometry group Iso of (M, g) on F, and\na Bose/Fermi automorphism \u03b3 whose square is the identity automorphism, and which\ncommutes with \u03b1. This automorphism will be used to separate the Bose/Fermi parts of\nfields F \u2208 F; in the model theory of a free Dirac field discussed later, it can be chosen\nas a rotation by 2\u03c0 in the Dirac bundle.\nTo allow for a straightforward application of the results of [BLS10], we will also\nassume in the following that the field algebra is concretely realized on a separable Hilbert\nspace H, which carries a unitary representation U of Iso implementing the action \u03b1, i.e.,\nU (h)F U (h)\u22121 = \u03b1h (F ) ,\n\nh \u2208 Iso, F \u2208 F .\n\nWe emphasize that despite working on a Hilbert space, we do not select a state, since\nwe do not make any assumptions regarding U -invariant vectors in H or the spectrum\nof subgroups of the representation U .4 The subsequent analysis will be carried out in a\nC \u2217 -setting, without using the weak closures of the field algebras F(W ) in B(H).\n4\nNote that every C \u2217 -dynamical system (A, G, \u03b1), where A \u2282 B(H) is a concrete C \u2217 -algebra on a\nseparable Hilbert space H and \u03b1 : G \u2192 Aut(A) is a strongly continuous representation of the locally\n\n15\n\n\fFor convenience, we also require the Bose/Fermi automorphism \u03b3 to be unitarily\nimplemented on H, i.e., there exists a unitary V = V \u2217 = V \u22121 \u2208 B(H) such that\n\u03b3(F ) = V F V . We will also use the associated unitary twist operator\n1\nZ := \u221a (1 \u2212 iV ) .\n2\n\n(3.1)\n\nClearly, the unitarily implemented \u03b1 and \u03b3 can be continued to all of B(H). By a slight\nabuse of notation, these extensions will be denoted by the same symbols.\nIn terms of the data {F(W )}W \u2208W , \u03b1, \u03b3, the structural properties of a quantum field\ntheory on M can be summarized as follows [Haa96, Ara99].\na) Isotony: F(W ) \u2282 F(W\u0303 ) whenever W \u2282 W\u0303 .\nb) Covariance under Iso:\nh \u2208 Iso, W \u2208 W .\n\n\u03b1h (F(W )) = F(hW ) ,\n\n(3.2)\n\nc) Twisted Locality: With the unitary Z (3.1), there holds\n[ZF Z \u2217 , G] = 0\n\nfor F \u2208 F(W ), G \u2208 F(W 0 ), W \u2208 W .\n\n(3.3)\n\nThe twisted locality condition (3.3) is equivalent to normal commutation relations\nbetween the Bose/Fermi parts F\u00b1 := 21 (F \u00b1\u03b3(F )) of fields in spacelike separated wedges,\n[F+ , G\u00b1 ] = [F\u00b1 , G+ ] = {F\u2212 , G\u2212 } = 0 for F \u2208 F(W ), G \u2208 F(W 0 ) [DHR69].\nThe covariance requirement (3.2) entails that for any Killing pair \u03be \u2208 \u039e, the algebra\nF carries a corresponding IR2 -action \u03c4\u03be , defined by\n\u03c4\u03be,s := \u03b1\u03c6\u03be,s = ad U\u03be (s) ,\n\ns \u2208 IR2 ,\n\nwhere U\u03be (s) is shorthand for U (\u03c6\u03be,s ). Since a wedge of the form W\u03be,p with some p \u2208 M\nis invariant under the flows \u03c6N \u03be,s for any N \u2208 GL(2, IR) (see Prop. 2.6 c) and Lemma\n2.2), we have in view of isotony\nN \u2208 GL(2, IR), s \u2208 IR2 .\n\n\u03c4N \u03be,s (F(W\u03be,p )) = F(W\u03be,p ) ,\n\nIn this setting, all structural elements necessary for the application of warped convolution deformations [BLS10] are present, and we will use this technique to define a\ndeformed net W 7\u2212\u2192 F(W )\u03bb of C \u2217 -algebras on M , depending on a deformation parameter \u03bb \u2208 IR. For \u03bb = 0, we will recover the original theory, F(W )0 = F(W ), and for\neach \u03bb \u2208 IR, the three basic properties a)\u2013c) listed above will remain valid. To achieve\nthis, the elements of F(W ) will be deformed with the help of the Killing flow leaving W\ninvariant. We begin by recalling some definitions and results from [BLS10], adapted to\nthe situation at hand.\ncompact group G, has a covariant representation [Ped79, Prop. 7.4.7, Lemma 7.4.9], build out of the\nleft-regular representation on the Hilbert space L2 (G) \u2297 H.\n\n16\n\n\fSimilar to the Weyl product appearing in the quantization of classical systems, the\nwarped convolution deformation is defined in terms of oscillatory integrals of F-valued\nfunctions, and we have to introduce the appropriate smooth elements first. The action \u03b1\nis a strongly continuous representation of the Lie group Iso, which acts automorphically\nand thus isometrically on the C \u2217 -algebra F. In view of these properties, the smooth\nelements F\u221e := {F \u2208 F : Iso 3 h 7\u2192 \u03b1h (F ) is k * kF -smooth} form a norm-dense \u2217 subalgebra F\u221e \u2282 F (see, for example, [Tay86]). However, the subalgebras F(W\u03be,p ) \u2282 F\nare in general only invariant under the IR2 -action \u03c4\u03be , and we therefore also introduce a\nweakened form of smoothness. An operator F \u2208 F will be called \u03be-smooth if\nIR2 3 s 7\u2192 \u03c4\u03be,s (F ) \u2208 F\n\n(3.4)\n\nis smooth in the norm topology of F. On the Hilbert space level, we have a dense domain\nH\u221e := {\u03a8 \u2208 H : Iso 3 h 7\u2192 U (h)\u03a8 is k * kH -smooth} of smooth vectors in H.\nAs further ingredients for the definition of the oscillatory integrals, we pick a smooth,\ncompactly supported \"cutoff\" function \u03c7 \u2208 C0\u221e (IR2 \u00d7 IR2 ) with \u03c7(0, 0) = 1, and the\nstandard antisymmetric (2 \u00d7 2)-matrix\n\u0012\n\u0013\n0 1\nQ :=\n.\n(3.5)\n\u22121 0\nWith these data, we associate to a \u03be-smooth F \u2208 F the deformed operator (warped\nconvolution) [BLS10]\nZ\n1\n0\n(3.6)\nF\u03be,\u03bb := 2 lim ds ds0 e\u2212iss \u03c7(\u03b5s, \u03b5s0 ) U\u03be (\u03bbQs)F U\u03be (s0 \u2212 \u03bbQs) ,\n\u03b5\u21920\n4\u03c0\nwhere \u03bb is a real parameter, and ss0 denotes the standard Euclidean inner product of\ns, s0 \u2208 IR2 . The above limit exists in the strong operator topology of B(H) on the dense\nsubspace H\u221e , and is independent of the chosen cutoff function \u03c7 within the specified\nclass. The thus (densely) defined operator F\u03be,\u03bb can be shown to extend to a bounded\n\u03be-smooth operator on all of H, which we denote by the same symbol [BLS10]. As can\nbe seen from the above formula, setting \u03bb = 0 yields the undeformed operator F\u03be,0 = F ,\nfor any \u03be \u2208 \u039e.\nThe deformation F \u2192 F\u03be,\u03bb is closely related to Rieffel's deformation of C \u2217 -algebras\n[Rie92], where one introduces the deformed product\nZ\n1\n0\n(3.7)\nF \u00d7\u03be,\u03bb G := 2 lim ds ds0 e\u2212iss \u03c7(\u03b5s, \u03b5s0 ) \u03c4\u03be,\u03bbQs (F )\u03c4\u03be,s0 (G) .\n4\u03c0 \u03b5\u21920\nThis limit exists in the norm topology of F for any \u03be-smooth F, G \u2208 F, and F \u00d7\u03be,\u03bb G is\n\u03be-smooth as well.\nAs is well known, this procedure applies in particular to the deformation of classical\ntheories in terms of star products. As field algebra, one would then take a suitable\ncommutative \u2217 -algebra of functions on M , endowed with the usual pointwise operations.\nThe isometry group acts on this algebra automorphically by pullback, and in particular,\nthe flow \u03c6\u03be of any Killing pair \u03be \u2208 \u039e induces automorphisms. The Rieffel product\n17\n\n\ftherefore defines a star product on the subalgebra of smooth elements f, g for this\naction,\nZ\n1\n0\n(f ?\u03be,\u03bb g)(p) = 2 lim d2 s d2 s0 e\u2212iss \u03c7(\u03b5s, \u03b5s0 ) f (\u03c6\u03be,\u03bbQs (p))g(\u03c6\u03be,s0 (p)) .\n(3.8)\n\u03b5\u21920\n4\u03c0\nThe function algebra endowed with this star product can be interpreted as a noncommutative version of the manifold M , similar to the flat case [GGBI+ 04]. Note that since\nwe are using a two-dimensional spacelike flow on a four-dimensional spacetime, the deformation corresponds to a noncommutative Minkowski space with \"commuting time\"\nin the flat case.\nThe properties of the deformation map F \u2192 F\u03be,\u03bb which will be relevant here are the\nfollowing.\nLemma 3.1 [BLS10]:\nLet \u03be \u2208 \u039e, \u03bb \u2208 IR, and consider \u03be-smooth operators F, G \u2208 F. Then\na) F\u03be,\u03bb \u2217 = F \u2217 \u03be,\u03bb .\nb) F\u03be,\u03bb G\u03be,\u03bb = (F \u00d7\u03be,\u03bb G)\u03be,\u03bb .\nc) If 5 [\u03c4\u03be,s (F ), G] = 0 for all s \u2208 IR2 , then [F\u03be,\u03bb , G\u03be,\u2212\u03bb ] = 0.\nd) If a unitary Y \u2208 B(H) commutes with U\u03be (s), s \u2208 IR2 , then Y F\u03be,\u03bb Y \u22121 = (Y F Y \u22121 )\u03be,\u03bb ,\nand Y F\u03be,\u03bb Y \u22121 is \u03be-smooth.\nSince we are dealing here with a field algebra obeying twisted locality, we also point\nout that statement c) of the above lemma carries over to the twisted local case.\nLemma 3.2 Let \u03be \u2208 \u039e and F, G \u2208 F be \u03be-smooth such that [Z\u03c4\u03be,s (F )Z \u2217 , G] = 0. Then\n[ZF\u03be,\u03bb Z \u2217 , G\u03be,\u2212\u03bb ] = 0 .\n\n(3.9)\n\nProof: The Bose/Fermi operator V commutes with the representation of the isometry\ngroup, and thus the same holds true for the twist Z (3.1). So in view of Lemma 3.1 d),\nthe assumption implies that ZF Z \u2217 is \u03be-smooth, and [\u03c4\u03be,s (ZF Z \u2217 ), G] = 0 for all s \u2208 IR2 .\nIn view of Lemma 3.1 c), we thus have [(ZF Z \u2217 )\u03be,\u03bb , G\u03be,\u2212\u03bb ] = 0. But as Z and U\u03be (s)\ncommute, (ZF Z \u2217 )\u03be,\u03bb = ZF\u03be,\u03bb Z \u2217 , and the claim follows.\n\u0003\nThe results summarized in Lemma 3.1 and Lemma 3.2 will be essential for establishing the isotony and twisted locality properties of the deformed quantum field theory.\nTo also control the covariance properties relating different Killing pairs, we need an\nadditional lemma, closely related to [BLS10, Prop. 2.9].\n5\nIn [BS08, BLS10], this statement is shown to hold under the weaker assumption that the commutator [\u03c4\u03be,s (F ), G] vanishes only for all s \u2208 S + S, where S is the joint spectrum of the generators of the\nIR2 -representation U\u03be implementing \u03c4\u03be . But since usually S = IR2 in the present setting, we refer here\nonly to the weaker statement, where S + S \u2282 IR2 has been replaced by IR2 .\n\n18\n\n\fLemma 3.3 Let \u03be \u2208 \u039e, \u03bb \u2208 IR, and F \u2208 F be \u03be-smooth.\na) Let h \u2208 Iso.

Since F is \u03be-smooth, and \u03b1h is isometric, the smoothness\nof s 7\u2192 \u03c4h\u2217 \u03be,s (\u03b1h (F )) follows. Using the strong convergence of the oscillatory integrals\n(3.6), we compute on a smooth vector \u03a8 \u2208 H\u221e\nZ\n1\n0\n\u03b1h (F\u03be,\u03bb )\u03a8 = 2 lim ds ds0 e\u2212iss \u03c7(\u03b5s, \u03b5s0 ) U (h\u03c6\u03be,\u03bbQs h\u22121 )\u03b1h (F )U (h\u03c6\u03be,s0 \u2212\u03bbQs h\u22121 )\u03a8\n4\u03c0 \u03b5\u21920\nZ\n1\n0\n= 2 lim ds ds0 e\u2212iss \u03c7(\u03b5s, \u03b5s0 ) U (\u03c6h\u2217 \u03be,\u03bbQs )\u03b1h (F )U (\u03c6h\u2217 \u03be,s0 \u2212\u03bbQs )\u03a8\n\u03b5\u21920\n4\u03c0\n= \u03b1h (F )h\u2217 \u03be,\u03bb \u03a8 ,\nwhich entails (3.10) since H\u221e \u2282 H is dense.\nb) In view of the transformation law \u03c6N \u03be,s = \u03c6\u03be,N T s (2.6), we get, \u03a8 \u2208 H\u221e ,\nZ\n1\n0\nFN \u03be,\u03bb \u03a8 = 2 lim ds ds0 e\u2212iss \u03c7(\u03b5s, \u03b5s0 ) U (\u03c6N \u03be,\u03bbQs )F U (\u03c6N \u03be,s0 \u2212\u03bbQs )\u03a8\n\u03b5\u21920\n4\u03c0\nZ\n1\n\u22121\n0\n= 2\nlim ds ds0 e\u2212i(N s,s ) \u03c7(\u03b5s, \u03b5(N T )\u22121 s0 ) U\u03be (\u03bbN T Qs)F U\u03be (s0 \u2212 \u03bbN T Qs)\u03a8\n4\u03c0 | det N | \u03b5\u21920\nZ\n1\n0\n= 2 lim ds ds0 e\u2212iss \u03c7(\u03b5N s, \u03b5(N T )\u22121 s0 ) U\u03be (\u03bbN T QN s)F U\u03be (s0 \u2212 \u03bbN T QN s)\u03a8\n4\u03c0 \u03b5\u21920\n= F\u03be,det N *\u03bb \u03a8 .\nIn the last line, we used the fact that the value of the oscillatory integral does not\ndepend on the choice of cutoff function \u03c7 or \u03c7N (s, s0 ) := \u03c7(N s, (N T )\u22121 s0 ), and the\nequation N T QN = det N * Q, which holds for any (2 \u00d7 2)-matrix N .\n\u0001\nThis proves (3.11), and since \u03be 0 = \u03a0\u03be, with the flip matrix \u03a0 = 01 10 which has\ndet \u03a0 = \u22121, also (3.12) follows.\n\u0003\nHaving established these properties of individual deformed operators, we now set out\nto deform the net W 7\u2192 F(W ) of wedge algebras. In contrast to the Minkowski space\nsetting [BLS10], we are here in a situation where the set \u039e of all Killing pairs is not a\nsingle orbit of one reference pair under the isometry group. Whereas the deformation\n19\n\n\fof a net of wedge algebras on Minkowski space amounts to deforming a single algebra\nassociated with a fixed reference wedge (Borchers triple), we have to specify\nF here more\ndata, related to the coherent subfamilies W[\u03be] in the decomposition W = [\u03be] W[\u03be] of W\n(2.15). For each equivalence class [\u03be], we choose a representative \u03be. In case there exists\nonly a single equivalence class, this simply amounts to fixing a reference wedge together\nwith a length scale for the Killing flow. With this choice of representatives \u03be \u2208 [\u03be] made,\nwe introduce the sets, p \u2208 M ,\nF(W\u03be,p )\u03bb := {F\u03be,\u03bb : F \u2208 F(W\u03be,p ) \u03be-smooth }k*k ,\nF(W\u03be0 ,p )\u03bb := {F\u03be0 ,\u03bb : F \u2208\n\n0\n)\nF(W\u03be,p\n\n0\n\n\u03be -smooth }\n\nk*k\n\n(3.13)\n.\n\n(3.14)\n\nHere \u03bb \u2208 IR is the deformation parameter, and the superscript denotes norm closure in\nB(H). Note that the deformed operators in F(W\u03be0 ,p )\u03bb have the form F\u03be0 ,\u03bb = F\u03be,\u2212\u03bb (3.12),\ni.e., the sign of the deformation parameter depends on the choice of reference Killing\npair.\nThe definitions (3.13, 3.14) are extended to arbitrary wedges by setting\n0\n0\nF(hW\u03be,p\n)\u03bb := \u03b1h (F(W\u03be,p\n)\u03bb ) .\n\nF(hW\u03be,p )\u03bb := \u03b1h (F(W\u03be,p )\u03bb ) ,\n\n(3.15)\n\nRecall that as h, p and [\u03be] vary over Iso, M and \u039e/\u223c, respectively, this defines F(W )\u03bb\nfor all W \u2208 W (cf. (2.16)). It has to be proven that this assignment is well-defined,\ne.g. that (3.15) is independent of the way the wedge hW\u03be,p = h\u0303W\u03be,p\u0303 is represented. This\nwill be done below. However, note that the definition of F(W )\u03bb does depend on our\nchoice of representatives \u03be \u2208 [\u03be], since rescaling \u03be amounts to rescaling the deformation\nparameter (Lemma 3.3 b)).\nBefore establishing the main properties of the assignment W \u2192 F(W )\u03bb , we check that\nthe sets (3.13, 3.14) are C \u2217 -algebras. As the C \u2217 -algebra F(W\u03be,p ) is \u03c4\u03be -invariant and \u03c4\u03be\nacts strongly continuously, the \u03be-smooth operators in F(W\u03be,p ) which appear in the definition (3.13) form a norm-dense \u2217 -subalgebra. Now the deformation F 7\u2192 F\u03be,\u03bb is evidently\nlinear and commutes with taking adjoints (Lemma 3.1 a)); so the sets F(W\u03be,p )\u03bb are\n\u2217\n-invariant norm-closed subspaces of B(H). To check that these spaces are also closed\nunder taking products, we again use the invariance of F(W\u03be,p ) under \u03c4\u03be : By inspection\nof the Rieffel product (3.7), it follows that for any two \u03be-smooth F, G \u2208 F(W\u03be,p ), also\nthe product F \u00d7\u03be,\u03bb G lies in this algebra (and is \u03be-smooth, see [Rie92]). Hence the\nmultiplication formula from Lemma 3.1 b) entails that the above defined F(W )\u03bb are\nactually C \u2217 -algebras in B(H).\nThe map W 7\u2192 F(W )\u03bb defines the wedge-local field algebras of the deformed quantum field theory. Their basic properties are collected in the following theorem.\nTheorem 3.4 The above constructed map W 7\u2212\u2192 F(W )\u03bb , W \u2208 W, is a well-defined,\nisotonous, twisted wedge-local, Iso-covariant net of C \u2217 -algebras on H, i.e., W, W\u0303 \u2208 W,\nF(W )\u03bb \u2282 F(W\u0303 )\u03bb\n[ZF\u03bb Z \u2217 , G\u03bb ] = 0\n\u03b1h (F(W )\u03bb ) = F(hW )\u03bb ,\n\nfor W \u2282 W\u0303 ,\nfor F\u03bb \u2208 F(W )\u03bb , G\u03bb \u2208 F(W 0 )\u03bb ,\nh \u2208 Iso .\n20\n\n(3.16)\n(3.17)\n(3.18)\n\n\fFor \u03bb = 0, this net coincides with the original net, F(W )0 = F(W ), W \u2208 W.\nProof: It is important to note from the beginning that all claimed properties relate only\nwedges in the same coherent subfamily W[\u03be] . This can be seen from the form (2.16) of\nW[\u03be] , which is manifestly invariant under isometries and causal complementation, and\nthe structure of the inclusions (Proposition 2.9). So in the following proof, it is sufficient\nto consider a fixed but arbitrary equivalence class [\u03be], with selected representative \u03be.\nWe begin with establishing the isotony of the deformed net, and therefore consider\n0\n, with h \u2208 Iso, p \u2208 M arbitrary, and \u03be \u2208 \u039e\ninclusions of wedges of the form hW\u03be,p , hW\u03be,p\nfixed. Starting with the inclusions hW\u03be,p \u2286 h\u0303W\u03be,p\u0303 , we note that according to (2.13) and\nProp. 2.9, there exists N \u2208 GL(2, IR) with positive determinant such that h\u2217 \u03be = N h\u0303\u2217 \u03be.\nEquivalently, (h\u0303\u22121 h)\u2217 \u03be = N \u03be, which by Lemma 2.2 implies det N = 1. By definition, a\ngeneric \u03be-smooth element of F(hW\u03be,p )\u03bb is of the form \u03b1h (F\u03be,\u03bb ) = \u03b1h (F )h\u2217 \u03be,\u03bb with some\n\u03be-smooth F \u2208 F(W\u03be,p ). But according to the above observation, this can be rewritten\nas\n\u03b1h (F\u03be,\u03bb ) = \u03b1h (F )h\u2217 \u03be,\u03bb = \u03b1h (F )N h\u0303\u2217 \u03be,\u03bb = \u03b1h (F )h\u0303\u2217 \u03be,\u03bb ,\n\n(3.19)\n\nwhere in the last equation we used det N = 1 and Lemma 3.3 b). Taking into account\nthat hW\u03be,p \u2286 h\u0303W\u03be,p\u0303 , and that the undeformed net is covariant and isotonous, we have\n\u03b1h (F ) \u2208 F(hW\u03be,p ) \u2282 F(h\u0303W\u03be,p ), and so the very right hand side of (3.19) is an element\nof F(h\u0303W\u03be,p )\u03bb . Going to the norm closures, the inclusion F(hW\u03be,p )\u03bb \u2282 F(h\u0303W\u03be,p )\u03bb of\nC \u2217 -algebras follows.\n0\n0\nAnalogously, an inclusion of causal complements, hW\u03be,p\n\u2286 h\u0303W\u03be,p\u0303\n, leads to the inclu\u2217\n0\n0\nsion of C -algebras F(hW\u03be,p )\u03bb \u2282 F(h\u0303W\u03be,p )\u03bb , the only difference to the previous argument\nconsisting in an exchange of h,h\u0303 and p, p\u0303.\nTo complete the investigation of inclusions of wedges in W[\u03be] , we must also consider\n0\nthe case hW\u03be,p \u2286 h\u0303W\u03be,p\u0303\n= Wh\u0303\u2217 \u03be0 ,p\u0303 . By the same reasoning as before, there exists a\nmatrix N with det N = 1 such that (h\u0303\u22121 h)\u2217 \u03be = N \u03be 0 = N \u03a0\u03be with the flip matrix \u03a0. So\nN 0 := N \u03a0 has determinant det N 0 = \u22121, and h\u2217 \u03be = N 0 h\u0303\u2217 \u03be 0 . Using (3.12), we find for\n\u03be-smooth F \u2208 F(hW\u03be,p ),\n\u03b1h (F\u03be,\u03bb ) = \u03b1h (F )h\u2217 \u03be,\u03bb = \u03b1h (F )N 0 h\u0303\u2217 \u03be0 ,\u03bb = \u03b1h (F )h\u0303\u2217 \u03be0 ,\u2212\u03bb .\n\n(3.20)\n\nBy isotony and covariance of the undeformed net, this deformed operator is an element\n0\n0\nof F(h\u0303W\u03be,p\u0303\n)\u03bb (3.14), and taking the norm closure in (3.14) yields F(hW\u03be,p )\u03bb \u2282 F(h\u0303W\u03be,p\u0303\n)\u03bb .\nSo the isotony (3.16) of the net is established. This implies in particular that the net\nF\u03bb is well-defined, since in case hW\u03be,p equals h\u0303W\u03be,p\u0303 or its causal complement, the same\n0\narguments yield the equality of F(hW\u03be,p )\u03bb and F(h\u0303W\u03be,p\u0303 )\u03bb respectively F(h\u0303W\u03be,p\u0303\n)\u03bb .\nThe covariance of W 7\u2192 F(W )\u03bb is evident from the definition. To check twisted\n0\nlocality, it is thus sufficient to consider the pair of wedges W\u03be,p , W\u03be,p\n. In view of the\n\u2217\ndefinition of the C -algebras F(W )\u03bb (3.13) as norm closures of algebras of deformed\nsmooth operators, it suffices to show that any \u03be-smooth F \u2208 F(W\u03be,p ), G \u2208 F(W\u03be0 ,p\u0303 )\nfulfill the commutation relation\n[ZF\u03be,\u03bb Z \u2217 , G\u03be0 ,\u03bb ] = 0 .\n21\n\n(3.21)\n\n\fBut G\u03be0 ,\u03bb = G\u03be,\u2212\u03bb (3.12), and since the undeformed net is twisted local and covariant,\nwe have [\u03c4\u03be,s (F ), G] = 0, for all s \u2208 IR2 , which implies [ZF\u03be,\u03bb Z \u2217 , G\u03be,\u2212\u03bb ] = 0 by Lemma\n3.2.\nThe fact that setting \u03bb = 0 reproduces the undeformed net is a straightforward\nconsequence of F\u03be,0 = F for any \u03be-smooth operator, \u03be \u2208 \u039e.\n\u0003\nTheorem 3.4 is our main result concerning the structure of deformed quantum field\ntheories on admissible spacetimes: It states that the same covariance and localization\nproperties as on flat spacetime can be maintained in the curved setting. Whereas the\naction of the isometry group and the chosen representation space of F are the same for all\nvalues of the deformation parameter \u03bb, the concrete C \u2217 -algebras F(W )\u03bb depend in a nontrivial and continuous way on \u03bb: For a fixed wedge W , the collection {F(W )\u03bb : \u03bb \u2208 IR}\nforms a continuous field of C \u2217 -algebras [Dix77]; this follows from Rieffel's results [Rie92]\nand the fact that F(W )\u03bb forms a faithful representation of Rieffel's deformed C \u2217 -algebra\n(F(W ), \u00d7\u03bb ) [BLS10].\nFor deformed nets on Minkowski space, there also exist proofs showing that the\nnet W 7\u2192 F(W )\u03bb depends on \u03bb, for example by working in a vacuum representation\nand calculating the corresponding collision operators [BS08]. There one finds as a\nstriking effect of the deformation that the interaction depends on \u03bb, i.e. that deformations of interaction-free models have non-trivial S-matrices. However, on generic\ncurved spacetimes, a distinguished invariant state like the vacuum state with its positive energy representation of the translations does not exist. Consequently, the result\nconcerning scattering theory cannot be reproduced here. Instead we will establish the\nnon-equivalence of the undeformed net W 7\u2192 F(W ) and the deformed net W 7\u2192 F(W )\u03bb ,\n\u03bb 6= 0, in a concrete example model in Section 3.2.\nAs mentioned earlier, the family of wedge regions W(M, g) is causally separating in a\nsubclass of admissible spacetimes, including the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker universes.\nIn this case, the extension of the net F\u03bb to double cones or similar regions O \u2282 M via\nF(O)\u03bb :=\n\n\\\n\nF(W )\u03bb\n\n(3.22)\n\nW \u2283O\n\nis still twisted local. These algebras contain all operators localized in the region O in\nthe deformed theory. On other spacetimes (M, g), such an extension is possible only for\nspecial regions, intersections of wedges, whose shape and size depend on the structure\nof W(M, g).\nBecause of the relation of warped convolution to noncommutative spaces, where\nsharp localization is impossible, it is expected that F(O) contains only multiples of the\nidentity if O has compact closure. We will study this question in the context of the\ndeformed Dirac field in Section 3.2.\nWe conclude this section with a remark concerning the relation between the field and\nobservable net structure of deformed quantum field theories. The field net F is composed of Bose and Fermi fields, and therefore contains observable as well as unobservable quantities. The former give rise to the observable net A which consists of the\n22\n\n\fsubalgebras invariant under the grading automorphism \u03b3. In terms of the projection\nv(F ) := 12 (F + \u03b3(F )), the observable wedge algebras are\nA(W ) := {F \u2208 F(W ) : F = \u03b3(F )} = v(F(W )) ,\n\nW \u2208W,\n\n(3.23)\n\nso that A(W ), A(W\u0303 ) commute (without twist) if W and W\u0303 are spacelike separated.\nSince the observables are the physically relevant objects, we could have considered\na deformation A(W ) \u2192 A(W )\u03bb of the observable wedge algebras along the same lines\nas we did for the field algebras. This approach would have resulted precisely in the\n\u03b3-invariant subalgebras of the deformed field algebras F(W )\u03bb , i.e., the diagram\ndeformation\n\nF(W ) \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 F(W )\u03bb\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6v\nvy\ny\ndeformation\n\nA(W ) \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 A(W )\u03bb\ncommutes. This claim can quickly be verified by noting that the projection v commutes\nwith the deformation map F 7\u2192 F\u03be,\u03bb .\n\n3.2\n\nThe Dirac field and its deformation\n\nAfter the model-independent description of deformed quantum field theories carried out\nin the previous section, we now consider the theory of a free Dirac quantum field as a\nconcrete example model. We first briefly recall the notion of Dirac (co)spinors and the\nclassical Dirac equation, following largely [DHP09, San08] and partly [Dim82, FV02],\nwhere the proofs of all the statements below are presented and an extensive description\nof the relevant concepts is available. Afterwards, we consider the quantum Dirac field\nusing Araki's self-dual CAR algebra formulation [Ara71].\nAs before, we work on a fixed but arbitrary admissible spacetime (M, g) in the sense of\nDefinition 2.1 and we fix its orientation. Therefore, as a four-dimensional, time oriented\nand oriented, globally hyperbolic spacetime, M admits a spin structure (SM, \u03c1), consisting of a principle bundle SM over M with structure group SL(2, C), and a smooth\nbundle homomorphism \u03c1 projecting SM onto the frame bundle F M , which is a principal\nbundle over M with SO0 (3, 1) as structure group. The map \u03c1 preserves base points and\nis equivariant in the sense that it intertwines the natural right actions R of SL(2, C) on\nSM and of SO0 (3, 1) on F M , respectively,\n\u03c1 \u25e6 R\u039be = R\u039b \u25e6 \u03c1,\n\n\u039b \u2208 SO0 (3, 1) ,\n\n(3.24)\n\ne from SL(2, C) to SO0 (3, 1).\nwith the covering homomorphism \u039b 7\u2192 \u039b\nAlthough each spacetime of the type considered here has a spin structure [DHP09,\nThm. 2.1, Lemma 2.1], this is only unique if the underlying manifold is simply connected [Ger68, Ger70], i.e., if all edges are simply connected in the case of an admissible\nspacetime. In the following, it is understood that a fixed choice of spin structure has\nbeen made.\n23\n\n\fThe main object we shall be interested in is the Dirac bundle, that is the associated\nvector bundle\nDM := SM \u00d7T C4\n1\n\n(3.25)\n\n1\n\nwith the representation T := D( 2 ,0) \u2295 D(0, 2 ) of SL(2, C) on C4 . Dirac spinors \u03c8 are\nsmooth global sections of DM , and the space they span will be denoted E(DM ). The\ndual bundle D\u2217 M is called the dual Dirac bundle, and its smooth global sections \u03c8 0 \u2208\nE(D\u2217 M ) are referred to as Dirac cospinors.\nFor the formulation of the Dirac equation, we need two more ingredients. The\nfirst are the so-called gamma-matrices, which are the coefficients of a global tensor\nA a\n\u03b3 \u2208 E(T \u2217 M \u2297 DM \u2297 D\u2217 M ) such that \u03b3 = \u03b3aB\ne \u2297 EA \u2297 E B . Here EA and E B\nwith A, B = 1, ..., 4 are four global sections of DM and D\u2217 M respectively, such that\n(EA , E B ) = \u03b4AB , with (, ) the natural pairing between dual elements. Notice that EA\ndescends also from a global section E of SM since we can define EA (x) := [(E(x), zA )]\nwhere zA is the standard basis of C4 . At the same time, out of E, we can construct ea ,\nwith a = 1, ..., 4, as a set of four global sections of T M once we define e := \u03c1 \u25e6 E as a\nglobal section of the frame bundle, which, in turn, can be read as a vector bundle over\nT M with IR4 as typical fibre. The set of all ea is often referred to as the non-holonomic\nbasis of the base manifold. In this case upper indices are defined via the natural pairing\nover IR4 , that is (eb , ea ) = \u03b4ab . Furthermore we choose the gamma-matrices to be of the\nfollowing form:\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\nI2 0\n0 \u03c3a\n\u03b30 =\n,\n\u03b3a =\n,\na = 1, 2, 3,\n(3.26)\n0 \u2212I2\n\u2212\u03c3a 0\nwhere the \u03c3a are the Pauli matrices, and In will henceforth denote the (n \u00d7 n) identity\nmatrix. These matrices fulfil the anticommutation relation {\u03b3a , \u03b3b } = 2\u03b7ab I4 , with the\nflat Minkowski metric \u03b7. They therefore depend on the sign convention in the metric\nsignature, and differ from those introduced in [DHP09], where a different convention\nwas used.\nThe last ingredient we need to specify is the covariant derivative (spin connection)\non the space of smooth sections of the Dirac bundle, that is\n\u2207 : E(DM ) \u2192 E(T \u2217 M \u2297 DM ),\n\n(3.27)\n\nB a\nwhose action on the sections EA is given as \u2207EA = \u03c3aA\ne EB . The connection coeffi1 b\nB dC\nb\nB\ncients can be expressed as \u03c3aA = 4 \u0393ad \u03b3bC \u03b3A , where \u0393ad are the coefficients arising from\nthe Levi-Civita connection expressed in terms of non-holonomic basis [DHP09, Lemma\n2.2].\n\nWe can now introduce the Dirac equation for spinors \u03c8 \u2208 E(DM ) and cospinors\n\u03c8 0 \u2208 E(D\u2217 M ) as\nD\u03c8 := (\u2212i\u03b3 \u03bc \u2207\u03bc + mI)\u03c8 = 0\nD0 \u03c8 0 := (+i\u03b3 \u03bc \u2207\u03bc + mI)\u03c8 0 = 0 ,\n24\n\n(3.28)\n(3.29)\n\n\fwhere m \u2265 0 is a constant while I is the identity on the respective space.\nThe Dirac equation has unique advanced and retarded fundamental solutions [DHP09]:\nDenoting the smooth and compactly supported sections of the Dirac bundle by D(DM ),\nthere exist two continuous linear maps\nS \u00b1 : D(DM ) \u2192 E(DM ),\nsuch that S \u00b1 D = DS \u00b1 = I and supp (S \u00b1 f ) \u2286 J \u00b1 (supp (f )) for all f \u2208 D(DM ), where\nJ \u00b1 stands for the causal future/past. In the case of cospinors, we shall instead talk\nabout S\u2217\u00b1 : D(D\u2217 M ) \u2192 E(D\u2217 M ) and they have the same properties of S \u00b1 , except that\nS\u2217\u00b1 D0 = D0 S\u2217\u00b1 = I. In analogy with the theory of real scalar fields, the causal propagators\nfor Dirac spinors and cospinors are defined as S := S + \u2212 S \u2212 and S\u2217 := S\u2217+ \u2212 S\u2217\u2212 ,\nrespectively.\nFor the formulation of a quantized Dirac field, it is advantageous to collect spinors\nand cospinors in a single object. We therefore introduce the space\nD := D(DM \u2295 D\u2217 M ) ,\n\n(3.30)\n\non which we have the conjugation\n\u0393(f1 \u2295 f2 ) := f1\u2217 \u03b2 \u2295 \u03b2 \u22121 f2\u2217 ,\n\n(3.31)\n\ndefined in terms of the adjoint f 7\u2192 f \u2217 on C4 and the Dirac conjugation matrix \u03b2.\nThis matrix is the unique selfadjoint element of SL(4, C) with the properties that \u03b3a\u2217 =\n\u2212\u03b2\u03b3a \u03b2 \u22121 , a = 0, ..., 3, and i\u03b2na \u03b3a is a positive definite matrix, for any timelike futuredirected vector n.\nDue to these properties, the sesquilinear form on D defined as\n(f1 \u2295 f2 , h1 \u2295 h2 ) := \u2212ihf1\u2217 \u03b2, Sh1 i + ihS\u2217 h2 , \u03b2 \u22121 f2\u2217 i,\n\n(3.32)\n\nwhere h, i is the global pairing between E(DM ) and D(D\u2217 M ) or between E(D\u2217 M ) and\nD(DM ), is positive semi-definite. Therefore the quotient\nK := D/(ker S \u2295 ker S\u2217 ) .\n\n(3.33)\n\nhas the structure of a pre-Hilbert space, and we denote the corresponding scalar product\n1/2\nand norm by h . , . iS and kf kS := hf, f iS . The conjugation \u0393 descends to the quotient\nK, and we denote its action on K by the same symbol. Moreover, \u0393 is compatible with\nthe sesquilinear form (3.32) in such a way that it extends to an antiunitary involution\n\u0393 = \u0393\u2217 = \u0393\u22121 on the Hilbert space K [San08, Lemma 4.2.4].\nRegarding covariance, the isometry group Iso of (M, g) naturally acts on the sections\nin D by pullback. In view of the geometrical nature of the causal propagator, this action\ndescends to the quotient K and extends to a unitary representation u of Iso on the Hilbert\nspace K.\nGiven the pre-Hilbert space K, the conjugation \u0393, and the representation u as above,\nthe quantized Dirac field can be conveniently described as follows [Ara71]. We consider\nthe C \u2217 -algebra CAR (K, \u0393), that is, the unique unital C \u2217 -algebra generated by the symbols B(f ), f \u2208 K, such that, for all f, h \u2208 K,\n25\n\n\fa) f 7\u2212\u2192 B(f ) is complex linear,\nb) B(f )\u2217 = B(\u0393f ),\nc) {B(f ), B(h)} = h\u0393f, hiS * 1.\nThe field equation is implicit here since we took the quotient with respect to the kernels of S, S\u2217 . The standard picture of spinors and cospinors can be recovered via the\nidentifications \u03c8(h) = B(0 \u2295 h) and \u03c8 \u2020 (f ) = B(f \u2295 0).\nAs is well known, the Dirac field satisfies the standard assumptions of quantum field\ntheory, and we briefly point out how this model fits into the general framework used\nin Section 3.1. The global field algebra F := CAR (K, \u0393) carries a natural Iso-action \u03b1\nby Bogoliubov transformations: Since the unitaries u(h), h \u2208 Iso, commute with the\nconjugation \u0393, the maps\n\u03b1h (B(f )) := B(u(h)f ) ,\n\nf \u2208 K,\n\nextend to automorphisms of F. Similarly, the grading automorphism \u03b3 is fixed by\n\u03b3(B(f )) := \u2212B(f ) ,\nand clearly commutes with \u03b1h . The field algebra is faithfully represented on the Fermi\nFock space H over K, where the field operators take the form\n1\nB(f ) = \u221a (a(f )\u2217 + a(\u0393f )) ,\n2\n\n(3.34)\n\nwith the usual Fermi Fock space creation/annihilation operators a# (f ), f \u2208 K. In\nthis representation, the second quantization U of u implements the action \u03b1. The\nBose/Fermi-grading can be implemented by V = (\u22121)N , where N \u2208 B(H) is the Fock\nspace number operator [Foi83].\nRegarding the regularity assumptions on the symmetries, recall that the anticommutation relations of the CAR algebra imply that ka(f )k = kf kS , and thus f 7\u2192 B(f ) is a\nlinear continuous map from K to F. As s 7\u2192 u\u03be (s)f is smooth in the norm topology of\nK for any \u03be \u2208 \u039e, f \u2208 K, this implies that the field operators B(f ) transform smoothly\nunder the action \u03b1. Furthermore, the unitarity of u yields strong continuity of \u03b1 on all\nof F, as required in Section 3.1.\nThe field algebra F(W ) \u2282 F associated with a wedge W \u2208 W is defined as the unital\n\u2217\nC -algebra generated by all B(f ), f \u2208 K(W ), where K(W ) is the set of (equivalence\nclasses of) smooth and compactly supported sections of DM \u2295 D\u2217 M with support in W .\nSince h\u0393f, giS = 0 for f \u2208 K(W ), g \u2208 K(W 0 ), we have {B(f ), B(g)} = 0 for f \u2208 K(W ),\ng \u2208 K(W 0 ), which implies the twisted locality condition (3.3). Isotony is clear from the\ndefinition, and covariance under the isometry group follows from u(h)K(W ) = K(hW ).\nThe model of the Dirac field therefore fits into the framework of Section 3.1, and the\nwarped convolution deformation defines a one-parameter family of deformed nets F\u03bb .\nBesides the properties which were established in the general setting in Section 3.1, we\ncan here consider the explicit deformed field B(f )\u03be,\u03bb . A nice characterization of these\n26\n\n\foperators can be given in terms of their n-point functions associated with a quasifree\nstate \u03c9 on F.\nLet \u03c9 be an \u03b1-invariant quasifree state on F, and let (H\u03c9 , \u03c0 \u03c9 , \u03a9\u03c9 ) denote the associated GNS triple. As a consequence of invariance of \u03c9, the GNS space H\u03c9 carries\na unitary representation U \u03c9 of Iso which leaves \u03a9\u03c9 invariant. In this situation, the\nwarping map\nZ\n1\n0\n\u03c9\nF\u03be,\u03bb 7\u2192 F\u03be,\u03bb := 2 lim ds ds0 e\u2212iss \u03c7(\u03b5s, \u03b5s0 ) U\u03be\u03c9 (\u03bbQs)\u03c0 \u03c9 (F )U\u03be\u03c9 (s0 \u2212 \u03bbQs) , (3.35)\n4\u03c0 \u03b5\u21920\ndefined for \u03be-smooth F \u2208 F as before, extends continuously to a representation of the\nRieffel-deformed C \u2217 -algebra (F, \u00d7\u03be,\u03bb ) on H\u03c9 [BLS10, Thm. 2.8]. Moreover, the U \u03c9 invariance of \u03a9\u03c9 implies\n\u03c9\n\u03a9\u03c9 = \u03c0 \u03c9 (F )\u03a9\u03c9 ,\nF\u03be,\u03bb\n\n\u03be \u2208 \u039e, \u03bb \u2208 IR, F \u2208 F \u03be-smooth.\n\n(3.36)\n\nSince the CAR algebra is simple, all its representations are faithful [BR97]. We will\ntherefore identify F with its representation \u03c0 \u03c9 (F) in the following, and drop the \u03c9\u03c9\ndependence of H\u03c9 , \u03a9\u03c9 , U \u03c9 and the warped convolutions F\u03be,\u03bb\nfrom our notation.\nTo characterize the deformed field operators B(f )\u03be,\u03bb , we will consider the n-point\nfunctions\n\u03c9n (f1 , ... , fn ) := \u03c9(B(f1 ) * * * B(fn )) = h\u03a9, B(f1 ) * * * B(fn )\u03a9i ,\n\nf1 , ... , fn \u2208 K ,\n\nand the corresponding deformed expectation values of the deformed fields, called deformed n-point functions,\n\u03c9n\u03be,\u03bb (f1 , ... , fn ) := h\u03a9, B(f1 )\u03be,\u03bb * * * B(fn )\u03be,\u03bb \u03a9i ,\n\nf1 , ... , fn \u2208 K .\n\nOf particular interest are the quasifree states, where \u03c9n vanishes if n is odd, and \u03c9n is a\nlinear combination of products of two-point functions \u03c92 if n is even. In particular, the\nundeformed four-point function of a quasifree state reads\n\u03c94 (f1 , f2 , f3 , f4 ) = \u03c92 (f1 , f2 )\u03c92 (f3 , f4 ) + \u03c92 (f1 , f4 )\u03c92 (f2 , f3 ) \u2212 \u03c92 (f1 , f3 )\u03c92 (f2 , f4 ) . (3.37)\nProposition 3.5 The deformed n-point functions of a quasifree and Iso-invariant state\nvanish for odd n. The lowest deformed even n-point functions are, f1 , ..., f4 \u2208 K,\n\u03c92\u03be,\u03bb (f1 , f2 ) = \u03c92 (f1 , f2 ) ,\n\u03c94\u03be,\u03bb (f1 , f2 , f3 , f4 )\n\n(3.38)\n\n= \u03c92 (f1 , f2 )\u03c92 (f3 , f4 ) + \u03c92 (f1 , f4 )\u03c92 (f2 , f3 )\n(3.39)\nZ\n1\n0\n\u2212 2 lim ds ds0 e\u2212iss \u03c7(\u03b5s, \u03b5s0 ) \u03c92 (f1 , u\u03be (s)f3 ) * \u03c92 (f2 , u\u03be (2\u03bbQs0 )f4 ) .\n\u03b5\u21920\n4\u03c0\n\nProof: The covariant transformation behaviour of the Dirac field, U\u03be (s)B(f )U\u03be (s)\u22121 =\nB(u\u03be (s)f ), the invariance of \u03a9 and the form (3.35) of the warped convolution imply that\nany deformed n-point function can be written as an integral over undeformed n-point\nfunctions with transformed arguments. As the latter functions vanish for odd n, we also\nhave \u03c9n\u03be,\u03bb = 0 for odd n.\n27\n\n\fTaking into account (3.36), we obtain for the deformed two-point function\n\u03c92\u03be,\u03bb (f1 , f2 ) = h\u03a9, B(f1 )\u03be,\u03bb B(f2 )\u03be,\u03bb \u03a9i\n= h(B(f1 )\u2217 )\u03be,\u03bb \u03a9, B(f2 )\u03be,\u03bb \u03a9i = hB(f1 )\u2217 \u03a9, B(f2 )\u03a9i = \u03c92 (f1 , f2 ) ,\nproving (3.38).\nTo compute the four-point function, we use again B(f )\u03be,\u03bb \u03a9 = B(f )\u03a9 and U\u03be (s)\u03a9 =\n\u03a9. Inserting the definition of the warped convolution (3.6), and using the transformation\nlaw U\u03be (s)B(f )U\u03be (s)\u22121 = B(u\u03be (s)f ) and the shorthand f (s) := u\u03be (s)f , we obtain\n\u03c94\u03be,\u03bb (f1 , f2 , f3 , f4 ) = h\u03a9, B(f1 )B(f2 )\u03be,\u03bb B(f3 )\u03be,\u03bb B(f4 )\u03a9i\nZ\n0\n0\n\u22124\n= (2\u03c0)\nlim\nds e\u2212i(s1 s1 +s2 s2 ) \u03c7\u03b5 (s) \u03c94 (f1 , f2 (\u03bbQs1 ), f3 (\u03bbQs2 + s01 ), f4 (s01 + s02 )) ,\n\u03b51 ,\u03b52 \u21920\n\nwhere ds = ds1 ds01 ds2 ds02 and \u03c7\u03b5 (s) = \u03c7(\u03b51 s1 , \u03b51 s01 )\u03c7(\u03b52 s2 , \u03b52 s02 ). After the substitutions s02 \u2192 s02 \u2212 s01 and s01 \u2192 s01 \u2212 \u03bbQs2 , the integrations over s2 , s02 and the limit \u03b52 \u2192 0\ncan be carried out. The result is\nZ\n0\n\u22122\n(2\u03c0) lim\nds1 ds01 e\u2212is1 s1 \u03c7\u0302(\u03b51 s1 , \u03b51 s01 ) \u03c94 (f1 , f2 (\u03bbQs1 ), f3 (s01 ), f4 (s01 \u2212 \u03bbQs1 )) ,\n\u03b51 \u21920\n\nwith a smooth, compactly supported cutoff function \u03c7\u0302 with \u03c7\u0302(0, 0) = 1.\nWe now use the fact that \u03c9 is quasi-free and write \u03c94 as a sum of products of twopoint functions (3.37). Considering the term where f1 , f2 and f3 , f4 are contracted, in\nthe second factor \u03c92 (f3 (s01 ), f4 (s01 \u2212 \u03bbQs1 )) the s01 -dependence drops out because \u03c9 is\ninvariant under isometries. So the integral over s01 can be performed, and yields a factor\n\u03b4(s1 ) in the limit \u03b51 \u2192 0. Hence all \u03bb-dependence drops out in this term, as claimed in\n(3.39).\nSimilarly, in the term where f1 , f4 and f2 , f3 are contracted, all integrations disappear\nafter using the invariance of \u03c9 and making the substitution s01 \u2192 s01 + \u03bbQs1 . Also this\nterm does not depend on \u03bb.\nFinally, we compute the term containing the contractions f1 , f3 and f2 , f4 ,\nZ\n0\n\u22122\n(2\u03c0) lim\nds1 ds01 e\u2212is1 s1 \u03c7\u0302(\u03b51 s1 , \u03b51 s01 ) \u03c92 (f1 , f3 (s01 )) * \u03c92 (f2 (\u03bbQs1 ), f4 (s01 \u2212 \u03bbQs1 ))\n\u03b51 \u21920\nZ\n0\n\u22122\n= (2\u03c0) lim\nds1 ds01 e\u2212is1 s1 \u03c7\u0302(\u03b51 s1 , \u03b51 s01 ) \u03c92 (f1 , f3 (s01 )) * \u03c92 (f2 , f4 (s01 \u2212 2\u03bbQs1 ))\n\u03b51 \u21920\nZ\n0\n\u22122\n= (2\u03c0) lim\nds1 ds01 e\u2212is1 s1 \u03c7\u0303(\u03b51 s1 , \u03b51 s01 ) \u03c92 (f1 , f3 (s01 )) * \u03c92 (f2 , f4 (2\u03bbQs1 )) .\n\u03b51 \u21920\n\n1\nIn the last step, we substituted s1 \u2192 s1 + 2\u03bb\nQ\u22121 s01 , used the antisymmetry of Q and\nabsorbed the new variables in \u03c7\u0302 in a redefinition of this function. Since the oscillatory\nintegrals are independent of the particular choice of cutoff function, comparison with\n(3.39) shows that the proof is finished.\n\u0003\n\nThe structure of the deformed n-point functions build from a quasifree state \u03c9 is quite\ndifferent from the undeformed case. In particular, the two-point function is undeformed,\n28\n\n\fbut the four-point function depends on the deformation parameter. For even n > 4, a\nstructure similar to the n-point functions on noncommutative Minkowski space [GL08]\nis expected, which are all \u03bb-dependent. These features clearly show that the deformed\nfield B(f )\u03be,\u03bb , \u03bb 6= 0, differs from the undeformed field. Considering the commutation\nrelations of the deformed field operators, it is also straightforward to check that the\ndeformed field is not unitarily equivalent to the undeformed one.\nHowever, this structure does not yet imply that the deformed and undeformed Dirac\nquantum field theories are inequivalent. For there could exist a unitary V on H satisfying\nV U (h)V \u2217 = U (h), h \u2208 Iso, V \u03a9 = \u03a9, which does not interpolate the deformed and\nundeformed fields, but the C \u2217 -algebras according to V F(W )\u03bb V \u2217 = F(W ), W \u2208 W. If\nsuch a unitary exists, the two theories would be physically indistinguishable.\nOn flat spacetime, an indirect way of ruling out the existence of such an intertwiner\nV , and thus establishing the non-equivalence of deformed and undeformed theories, is\nto compute their S-matrices and show that these depend on \u03bb in a non-trivial manner.\nHowever, on curved spacetimes, collision theory is not available and we will therefore\nfollow the more direct non-equivalence proof of [BLS10, Lemma 4.6], adapted to our\nsetting. This proof aims at showing that the local observable content of warped theories\nis restricted in comparison to the undeformed setting, as one would expect because\nof the connection ot noncommutative spacetime. However, the argument requires a\ncertain amount of symmetry, and we therefore restrict here to the case of a FriedmannRobertson-Walker spacetime M .\nAs discussed in Section 2.2, M can then be viewed as J \u00d7 IR3 \u2282 IR4 via a conformal\nembedding, where J \u2282 IR is an interval. Recall that in this case, we have the Euclidean\ngroup E(3) contained in Iso(M, g), and can work in global coordinates (\u03c4, x, y, z), where\n\u03c4 \u2208 J and x, y, z \u2208 IR are the flow parameters of Killing fields. As reference Killing\npair, we pick \u03b6 := (\u2202y , \u2202z ), and as reference wedge, the \"right wedge\" W 0 := W\u03b6,0 =\n{(\u03c4, x, y, z) : \u03c4 \u2208 J, x > |\u03c4 |}.\nIn this geometric context, consider the rotation r\u03c6 about angle \u03c6 in the x-y-plane,\nand the cone\nC := r\u03c6 W 0 \u2229 r\u2212\u03c6 W 0 ,\n\n(3.40)\n\nwith some fixed angle |\u03c6| < \u03c02 . Clearly C \u2282 W 0 , and the reflected cone jx C, where\njx (t, x, y, z) = (t, \u2212x, y, z), lies spacelike to W 0 and r\u03c6 W 0 .\nMoreover, we will work in the GNS-representation of a particular state \u03c9 on F for\nthe subsequent proposition, which besides the properties mentioned above also has the\nReeh-Schlieder property. That is, the von Neumann algebra F(C)00 \u2282 B(H\u03c9 ) has \u03a9\u03c9 as\na cyclic vector.\nSince the Dirac field theory is a locally covariant quantum field theory satisfying\nthe time slice axiom [San10], the existence of such states can be deduced by spacetime\ndeformation arguments [San09, Thm. 4.1]. As M and the Minkowski space have unique\nspin structures, and M can be deformed to Minkowski spacetime in such a way that its\nE(3) symmetry is preserved, the state obtained from deforming the Poincar\u00e9 invariant\nvacuum state on IR4 is still invariant under the action of the Euclidean group.\nIn the GNS representation of such a Reeh-Schlieder state on a Friedmann-RobertsonWalker spacetime, we find the following non-equivalence result.\n29\n\n\fProposition 3.6 Consider the net F\u03bb generated by the deformed Dirac field on a Friedmann-Robertson-Walker spacetime with flat spatial sections in the GNS representation\nof an invariant state with the Reeh-Schlieder property. Then the implementing vector \u03a9\nis cyclic for the field algebra F(C)\u03bb 00 associated with the cone (3.40) if and only if \u03bb = 0.\nIn particular, the nets F0 and F\u03bb are inequivalent for \u03bb 6= 0.\nProof: Let f \u2208 K(C), so that f, u(r\u2212\u03c6 )f \u2208 K(W 0 ), and both field operators, B(f )\u03b6,\u03bb\nand B(u(r\u2212\u03c6 )f )\u03b6,\u03bb , are contained in F(W 0 )\u03bb . Taking into account the covariance of the\ndeformed net, it follows that U (r\u03c6 )B(u(r\u2212\u03c6 )f )\u03b6,\u03bb U (r\u2212\u03c6 ) = B(f )r\u2217\u03c6 \u03b6,\u03bb lies in F(r\u03c6 W 0 )\u03bb .\nNow the cone C is defined in such a way that the two wedges W 0 and r\u03c6 W 0 lie\nspacelike to jx C. Let us assume that \u03a9 is cyclic for F(C)\u03bb 00 , which by the unitarity\nof U (jx ) is equivalent to \u03a9 being cyclic for F(jx C)\u03bb 00 . Hence \u03a9 is separating for the\ncommutant F(jx C)\u03bb 0 , which by locality contains F(W 0 )\u03bb and F(r\u03c6 W 0 )\u03bb . But in view of\n(3.36), B(f )\u03b6,\u03bb and B(f )r\u2217\u03c6 \u03b6,\u03bb coincide on \u03a9,\nB(f )r\u2217\u03c6 \u03b6,\u03bb \u03a9 = B(f )\u03a9 = B(f )\u03b6,\u03bb \u03a9 ,\nso that the separation property implies B(f )\u03b6,\u03bb = B(f )r\u2217\u03c6 \u03b6,\u03bb .\nTo produce a contradiction, we now show that these two operators are actually\nnot equal. To this end, we consider a difference of four-point functions (3.39), with\nsmooth vectors f1 , f2 := f, f3 := f, f4 , and Killing pairs \u03b6 respectively r\u2217\u03c6 \u03b6. With the\n\u03c6\nabbreviations wij\n(s) := \u03c92 (fi , ur\u2217\u03c6 \u03b6 (s)fj ), we obtain\n\u0001\nh\u03a9, B(f1 ) B(f )\u03b6,\u03bb B(f )\u03b6,\u03bb \u2212 B(f )r\u2217\u03c6 \u03b6,\u03bb B(f )r\u2217\u03c6 \u03b6,\u03bb B(f4 )\u03a9i\n\u03c6\n\n= \u03c94\u03b6,\u03bb (f1 , f, f, f4 ) \u2212 \u03c94r\u2217 \u03b6,\u03bb (f1 , f, f, f4 )\n\u03c6\n\u03c6\n0\n0\n= (w13\n?\u03bb w24\n)(0) \u2212 (w13\n?\u03bb w24\n)(0) ,\nwhere ?\u03bb denotes the Weyl-Moyal star product on smooth bounded functions on IR2 ,\nwith the standard Poisson bracket given by the matrix (3.5) in the basis {\u03b61 , \u03b62 }. Now\nthe asymptotic expansion of this expression for \u03bb \u2192 0 gives in first order the difference\nof Poisson brackets [EGBV89]\n\u03c6\n\u03c6\n0\n0\n{w13\n, w24\n}(0) \u2212 {w13\n, w24\n}(0) = hf1 , P1\u03b6 f ihf, P2\u03b6 f4 i \u2212 hf1 , P2\u03b6 f ihf, P1\u03b6 f4 i\n\u03c6\n\n\u03c6\n\n\u03c6\n\n\u03c6\n\n\u2212 hf1 , P1r\u2217 \u03b6 f ihf, P2r\u2217 \u03b6 f4 i + hf1 , P2r\u2217 \u03b6 f ihf, P1r\u2217 \u03b6 f4 i ,\n\u03c6\n\n\u03c6\n\nwhere all scalar products are in K and P1r\u2217 \u03b6 , P1r\u2217 \u03b6 denote the generators of s 7\u2192 ur\u2217\u03c6 \u03b6 (s).\n\u03c6\nBy considering f4 orthogonal to P1\u03b6 f and P1r\u2217 \u03b6 f , we see that for B(f )\u03b6,\u03bb = B(f )r\u2217\u03c6 \u03b6,\u03bb\n\u03c6\nit is necessary that hf1 , (Pj\u03b6 \u2212 Pjr\u2217 \u03b6 )f i = 0. But varying f, f1 within the specified\n\u03c6\nlimitations gives dense subspaces in K, i.e. we must have Pj\u03b6 = Pjr\u2217 \u03b6 . This implies that\ntranslations in a spacelike direction are represented trivially on the Dirac field, which is\nnot compatible with its locality and covariance properties.\nSo we conclude that the deformed field operator B(f )r\u2217\u03c6 \u03b6,\u03bb is not independent of \u03c6\nfor \u03bb 6= 0, and hence the cyclicity assumption is not valid for \u03bb 6= 0. Since on the\nother hand \u03a9 is cyclic for F(C)0 00 by the Reeh-Schlieder property of \u03c9, and a unitary\nV leaving \u03a9 invariant and mapping F(C)0 onto F(C)\u03bb would preserve this property, we\nhave established that the nets F0 and F\u03bb , \u03bb 6= 0, are not equivalent.\n\u0003\n30\n\n\f4\n\nConclusions\n\nIn this paper we have shown how to apply the warped convolution deformation to\nquantum field theories on a large class of globally hyperbolic spacetimes. Under the\nrequirement that the group of isometries contains a two-dimensional Abelian subgroup\ngenerated by two commuting spacelike Killing fields, many results known for Minkowski\nspace theories were shown to carry over to the curved setting by formulating concepts\nlike edges, wedges and translations in a geometrical language. In particular, it has been\ndemonstrated in a model-independent framework that the basic covariance and wedgelocalization properties we started from are preserved for all values of the deformation\nparameter \u03bb. As a concrete example we considered a warped Dirac field on a FriedmannRobertson-Walker spacetime in the GNS representation of a quasifree and Iso-invariant\nstate with Reeh-Schlieder property. It was shown that the deformed models depend in\na non-trivial way on \u03bb, and violate the Reeh-Schlieder property for regions smaller than\nwedges. In view of the picture that the deformed models can be regarded as effective\ntheories on a noncommutative spacetime, where strictly local quantities do not exist\nbecause of space-time uncertainty relations, it is actually expected that they do not\ncontain operators sharply localized in bounded spacetime regions for \u03bb 6= 0.\nAt the current stage, it is difficult to give a clear-cut physical interpretation to the\nmodels constructed here since scattering theory is not available for quantum field theories on generic curved spacetimes. Nonetheless, it is interesting to note that in a field\ntheoretic context the deformation often leaves invariant the two-point function (Prop.\n3.5), the quantity which is most frequently used for deriving observable quantum effects\nin cosmology (for the example of quantised cosmological perturbations, see [MFB92]).\nSo when searching for concrete scenarios where deformed quantum field theories can\nbe matched to measurable effects, one has to look for phenomena involving the higher\nn-point functions.\nThere exist a number of interesting directions in which this research could be extended.\nAs far as our geometrical construction of wedge regions in curved spacetimes is concerned, we limited ourselves here to edges generated by commuting Killing fields. This\nassumption rules out many physically interesting spacetimes, such as de Sitter, Kerr or\nFriedmann-Robertson-Walker spacetimes with compact spatial sections. An extension\nof the geometric construction of edges and wedges to such spaces seems to be straightforward and is expected to coincide with the notions which are already available. For\nexample, in the case of four-dimensional de Sitter spacetime, edges have the topology of\na two-sphere. Viewing the two-sphere as an SO(3) orbit, a generalization of the warped\nconvolution deformation formula could involve an integration over this group instead of\nIR2 . A deformation scheme of C \u2217 -algebras which is based on an action of this group\nis currently not yet available (see however [Bie07] for certain non-Abelian group action). In the de Sitter case, a different possibility is to base the deformation formula on\nthe flow of a spacelike and commuting timelike Killing field leaving a wedge invariant.\nThe covariance properties of the nets which arise from such a procedure are somewhat\ndifferent and require an adaption of the kernel in the warped convolution [Mo10].\n\n31\n\n\fIt is desireable to find more examples of adequate deformation formulas compatible\nwith the basic covariance and (wedge-) localization properties of quantum field theory.\nA systematic exploration of the space of all deformations is expected to yield many\nnew models and a better understanding of the structure of interacting quantum field\ntheories.\nAcknowledgements\nC.D. gratefully acknowledges financial support from the Junior Fellowship Programme\nof the Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger Institute and from the German Research Foundation DFG\nthrough the Emmy Noether Fellowship WO 1447/1-1.
