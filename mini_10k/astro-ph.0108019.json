(AURA) under cooperative agreement with the National Science\nFoundation.\n\n\f\u20132\u2013\n\n1.\n\nIntroduction\n\nNGC 1275 (Perseus A, 3C 84) is one of the most unusual early-type galaxies in the nearby universe\nand contains an example of almost every known extragalactic phenomenon. However, several of its basic\nobserved features still remain a mystery. NGC 1275 is located at the center of the Perseus cluster and\nresembles a normal elliptical galaxy on low-resolution plates (Hubble 1931). Humason (1932) and later\nSeyfert (1943) discovered strong emission lines in NGC 1275. Later, Minkowski (1955) found two distinct\nemission line systems towards NGC 1275; a high velocity (HV) component at V = 8200 km s\u22121 , and a low\nvelocity (LV) one at V = 5200 km s\u22121 . The stellar radial velocity of NGC 1275 is 5264\u00b111 km s\u22121 (Huchra,\nVogeley & Geller 1999) while the velocity dispersion of the Perseus cluster is 1277 km s\u22121 (Struble &\nRood 1991). The puzzling nature of NGC 1275 was compounded by the discovery of an extensive array\nof emission line filaments projecting away from the central galaxy (Minkowski 1957; Lynds 1970). The\norigin of these features is still being debated (e.g., McNamara, O'Connell, & Sarazin 1996; Sabra, Shields,\n& Filippenko 2000).\nThe HV system is located to the north and north-west direction of the nucleus (Burbidge & Burbidge\n1965; Rubin et al. 1977). The presence of HI and X-ray absorption clearly places this gas in front of the\nnucleus, where it is difficult to explain as a simple outflow (De Young, Roberts & Saslaw 1973; van Gorkom\n& Ekers 1983; Fabian et al. 2000). Thus, this object could be associated with a foreground late-type spiral\nfalling into the cluster (Rubin et al. 1977; Kent & Sargent 1979; Boroson 1990; Caulet et al. 1992).\nDespite appearing as an elliptical galaxy on photographic plates, particularly in the red, NGC 1275 has\nrelatively blue central colors (e.g. van den Bergh 1977), massive young star clusters (Shields & Filippenko\n1990; Holtzman et al. 1992), an A-type integrated blue region spectrum (Wirth et al. 1983) and internal\nsub-structures (Holtzman et al. 1992). Massive, short-lived stars are forming in NGC 1275, that perhaps\noriginate from gas accretion induced in a cooling flow (e.g. Cowie et al. 1980; Sarazin & O'Connell 1983),\nor their formation is induced from a galaxy merger independent of the high-velocity system (Holtzman et\nal. 1992).\nIs star formation related to the filamentary structure of ionized gas seen in Figure 1? Fabian and\nNulsen (1977) interpreted these filaments as a result of accretion of cooling intracluster medium (ICM) gas.\nPioneering digital optical spectroscopy yielded emission line intensities of the filaments that are consistent\nwith either shocked gas or gas photo-ionization by the inferred active BL Lac nucleus in NGC 1275\n(Kent & Sargent 1979). Recently Sabra, Shields, and Filippenko (2000) found that neither shocks nor\nphotoionization alone can reproduce the observed emission line intensity ratios in the inner part of the\ngalaxy.\nIn this paper, we present high-resolution images, integral field and long-slit spectroscopy of NGC 1275\ntaken with the WIYN 3.5m and KPNO 4m telescopes. We present evidence that the low-velocity ionized\ngas within NGC 1275 is partially supported by rotation, consistent with a rotating gas disk as seen in\nemission from CO (Bridges & Irwin 1998). Properties of the filament system as a whole appear to be\nconsistent with the model proposed by McNamara, O'Connell, and Sarazin (1996; hereafter MOS96). They\nsuggested that the ionized filaments originate from interactions between the hot ICM and the relativistic\nplasma responsible for the radio source (see also B\u00f6hringer et al. 1993; Heinz, Reynolds & Begelman 1998;\nChurazov et al. 2000). Instabilities should occur in the compressed and cooling ICM as it sinks through the\ndilute relativistic plasma, possibly in a manner similar to that of ionized gas filaments in the Crab nebula\n(Hester et al. 1996). This process could lead to the production of a radial system of filaments.\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\n\nWe employ several methods to investigate the structure of the stellar body of NGC 1275, including\nB\u2212R color maps, and the removal of symmetric, or smooth light, components to reveal complex or\nasymmetric features. We find more evidence for low amplitude, blue stellar shells or ripples in the main\nbody of the galaxy (cf., Holtzman et al. 1992; Carlson et al. 1998) and blue star clusters possibly not\nassociated with the LV H\u03b1 emission. NGC 1275 clearly suffered a recent, significant perturbation, probably\ninduced by some type of merger, which may be the source of the system's peculiarities.\nSection 2 of the paper describes the observations, Section 3 is an analysis of the data, Section 4 is an\ninterpretation, while Section 5 gives a summary. Throughout this paper we use the following terminology:\n'low-velocity (LV) system' denotes the 5200 km s\u22121 ionized gas around NGC 1275, 'high-velocity (HV)\nsystem' denotes the 8200 km s\u22121 ionized gas system localized to the northwest of NGC 1275, and 'NGC 1275'\nrefers to the central galaxy (redshift 5264 km s\u22121 ) of the Perseus cluster without regard to the LV or\nHV ionized gas components. For quantities not expressed in terms of h100 \u22121 , we adopt a distance to the\nPerseus cluster of 70 Mpc.\n\n2.\n\nObservations\n\nThe images used in this paper were taken in 1998 November with the WIYN 3.5m telescope located\nat the Kitt Peak National Observatory near Tucson, AZ. CCD images were obtained with a 20482-pixel\nthinned S2kB device, producing data with a scale of 0.2 arcsec per pixel. The field of view of each image\nis 6.8 \u00d7 6.8 arcmin2 . NGC 1275 and the surrounding region of the core of the cluster were observed in\nthe broadband R and B filters, as well as a narrow band H\u03b1 filter centered on the radial velocity of the\nLV component (KPNO filter KP1495 with central wavelength 6690 \u00c5 and FWHM of 77 \u00c5) which excludes\nmost of the emission from the HV system.\nExposure times for the R images were 2 \u00d7 800 sec, while the exposure times for the B images were 3\n\u00d7 700 sec, and the H\u03b1 images had exposure times of 3 \u00d7 800 sec. The average seeing for all the combined\nimages is 0.6\u2032\u2032 - 0.8\u2032\u2032 . Conditions were photometric, allowing magnitudes to be calibrated using Landolt\nstandard star fields. These images are part of a larger program to study the galaxy populations in the\nPerseus Cluster (e.g., Conselice, Gallagher & Wyse 2001). A total of 231 arcmin2 of area in the core of the\nPerseus cluster was imaged during this run.\nWe removed the continuum from the combined 2400s H\u03b1 image by subtracting a R band image\nnormalized with respect to field stars, with an estimated accuracy of 7%. We calibrated the H\u03b1 fluxes with\nthe spectrophotometric standard SA 29-130, a DA white dwarf with spectrophotometry by Oke (1974).\nWe convolved the spectrum of SA 29-130 with the filter transmission function to obtain a calibrated flux,\nyielding 2.6 \u00d7 10\u221215 erg s\u22121 cm\u22122 /(count/s) corrected for Galactic extinction. The total H\u03b1 luminosity of\nthe LV component of NGC 1275 in the H\u03b1 + [NII] emission lines is then 4.9 \u00d71042 erg s\u22121 . No significant\nH\u03b1 emission is present in locations beyond the NGC 1275 filaments. We correct for Galactic extinction\nusing E(B\u2212V) = 0.17 and AB = 0.71, AR = 0.40 (Burstein & Heiles 1984).\nIntegral field spectroscopy of the center of NGC 1275 was obtained with the Densepak fiber array\n(Barden & Wade 1988) on WIYN during November 1998. Densepak contains 94 optical fibers arranged\nin an area 45\u2032\u2032 \u00d7 27\u2032\u2032 , with each fiber separated by 4\u2032\u2032 . The spectral resolution was 3 \u00c5 (\u223c140 km s\u22121 at\nH\u03b1). Three 900 second exposures were taken, and later reduced by the IRAF task DOHYDRA. A CuAr\ncomparison source was used to produce a wavelength calibration. The variable and unpredictable flux\nthroughput of each fiber makes spectrophotometry with Densepak unreliable. Accordingly, we derive only\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\n\nan integral field velocity map from the fiber spectra. We measure and fit the low-velocity H\u03b1 line in each\nfiber to obtain a central wavelength and radial velocity, which we use to produce a velocity field.\nAdditional long slit spectroscopy was obtained with the RC spectrograph on the KPNO 4m Mayall\ntelescope on 1999 October 2 for spectrophotometric purposes. We chose three different filaments around the\ncenter and 2\u2032 from NGC1275. The KPC-10A grating was used, giving a wavelength coverage of 4000 \u00c5 with\na 2\u2032\u2032 \u00d7 300\u2032\u2032 slit, and 7 \u00c5 resolution. Two 750s exposures were taken in each of the three different areas of\nthe ionized filaments of NGC1275. These data were reduced with the KPNO long-slit tools, undergoing a\ntrim, extraction and sky subtraction. The spectra were then calibrated in wavelength with an FeAr lamp\nand flux calibrated by the standard BD+28 4211. The useful wavelength range of the spectra is 3700 \u00c5\nto 7800 \u00c5. We corrected the spectra for interstellar extinction using the method of Cardelli, Clayton and\nMathis (1989), using E(B\u2212V) = 0.17.\n\n3.\n\nResults\n\n3.1.\n\nH\u03b1 Structure of the Low-Velocity Ionized Gas\n\n3.1.1.\n\nThe Forms and Origin of the Ionized Gas Filaments\n\nOne of the most remarkable properties of NGC 1275 is the intricate array of LV H\u03b1 filaments that can\nbe seen in Figures 1-6. Our angular resolution of 0.6-0.8\u2032\u2032 corresponds to 150-200h100\u22121 pc at the distance\nof NGC 1275, and structures exist in these filaments down to this resolution limit. Following the description\nof the NGC 1275 filaments by Lynds (1970), extended H\u03b1 emission has been observed surrounding other\ncentral cluster galaxies (e.g., Heckman 1981, Heckman et al. 1989). In some cases filamentary morphologies\nsimilar to that in NGC 1275 are found, as in Hubble Space Telescope images of the central cD galaxy in the\ncluster Abell 2597 (Koekemoer et al. 1999).\nThe filaments cover a total linear distance of nearly 100h100 \u22121 kpc from north to south. These extend\nfrom a central system of filamentary ionized gas in NGC 1275 that is elongated over approximately\n\u224840h100 \u22121 kpc in the east-west direction, along the major axis of the stellar part of the galaxy. The large\nnorth-south extent of 100 h100 \u22121 kpc occurs for only a small number of thin, largely unresolved filaments\n(Figures 2 & 5). Figure 7 shows both the surface brightness profile of the H\u03b1 emission and its projected\nfilling factor. Despite the fact that the filling factor declines significantly after \u223c 4 kpc, the annular\nbrightness of the filaments remains high.\nThere are two major forms of ionized gas structures around NGC 1275 - radial and tangential filaments.\nThe radial types point towards the center of NGC 1275; while tangential features usually, but not always,\nare located at the outer extreme of the H\u03b1 emitting gas in any particular location. The tangential filaments\ncurve around the galaxy and are concave towards its center. How these two types of filaments relate to each\nother and to the intergalactic medium around NGC 1275 provides insights into the origin of the ionized\ngas. Figures 3 and 4 show examples of radial and tangential filaments, which can be seen in abundance\nthroughout the filament system in Figures 1 and 2. The east-west axis of NGC 1275 is less extended in\nH\u03b1 gas, and shows a predominance of tangential filaments (Figure 4). Figure 3 illustrates a remarkable\nfilament that remains radial for 30 kpc before folding backwards. The smooth, very elongated morphologies\nof the filaments suggest that magnetic fields could play a part in defining their structures, as they do in the\nsmaller Crab Nebula ionized filament system (Hester et al. 1996). In fact, some form of additional support,\nsuch as magnetic fields, is likely needed to explain the structures of these filaments. For a temperature\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\nof 104 K, the filaments will have an average internal random motion \u223c 10 km s\u22121 , giving a lifetime \u223c\nwidth/velocity = 0.5 kpc/10 km s\u22121 = 50 Myrs. Either the filaments are supported by processes that allow\nthem to survive more than 50 Myrs, or they are continuously being reformed.\nSince we probably have not completely resolved most filaments, we are thus likely underestimating\ntheir surface brightnesses. The evolution of filaments near the center of NGC 1275, which might be more\ncompressed, could be quite complex. It is possible that compression and instabilities operate in tandem, as\nin the Crab nebula (e.g., Hester et al. 1996). Features such as the long linear structure of ionized filaments\nextending to the north could be the remnants of ICM gas that was displaced by a northward non-thermal\nradio jet (see Figure 6) that may have been more intense in the past (Pedlar et al. 1990, MOS96, Blundel,\nKassim, & Perley 2000). Figure 6 displays the contours from a 1320 MHz VLA radio map, from Pedlar\net al. (1990), over the H\u03b1 + continuum image of the central parts of NGC 1275. This Figure shows the\nopposite major axis directions of the two components. In \u00a74.2 we discuss the MOS96 model for filament\nproduction in interactions between relativistic plasma outflows from NGC 1275 and the ICM.\nThe complex filament morphologies lead us to ask what is the true distribution of the H\u03b1 gas around\nNGC 1275. Do the filaments have tubular structures, or are they extended sheets between ionization\nand shock fronts, possibly along the edges of expanding bubbles? The surface brightnesses of individual\nfilaments are relatively constant over 50 kpc. For example, the large radial filament at the base of the\n'horseshoe' in Figure 3 has 1.0 < I(H\u03b1+[N II])/(10\u221215 erg s\u22121 cm\u22122 arcsec\u22122) < 6, while a similar range\nis found along the very extended northern filaments (Figure 5; Table 1). The filaments often have high\ncontrast with respect to their surroundings, again suggesting a relatively compact physical structure. Table\n1 lists the fluxes and intensities of the emission line regions labeled in Figure 5, measured using a 1\u2032\u2032 circular\naperture, relative to a local sky measurement.\nThe near constant surface brightnesses, large linear extent of the northern filaments, and small angular\nsizes of the radial filaments all imply that they are tubes or compact ribbons of ionized gas, and not\nprojected edges of large bubbles. Further support for the filament interpretation comes from the presence of\nlocalized, unresolved high surface brightness areas. These \"knots\" could be examples of filaments seen end\non, especially in the central part of the filament system (see Figure 4 & 5 and entries 28 - 38 in Table 2 for\nexamples), a similar phenomenon is observed in the Crab nebula (see Hester et al. 1996). However, some\nknots are far out in the system where an end-on projection is less likely; these could be locations where the\nvolume emissivity is locally enhanced, e.g., due to high electron densities or more intense heating of the gas.\nThese ionized knots, labeled as hexagons in Figure 5, mostly have H\u03b1 fluxes \u223c 10\u221214 erg s\u22121 cm\u22122 . Some\nof these could also be HII regions.\nThe tangential filaments also present an interesting picture. When curvature is present, the filaments\nclose in around NGC 1275; an outstanding example is the 'horseshoe' located to the northwest of NGC 1275\n(Figure 3). This pattern is commonly associated with an outward displacement of gas; the loops could mark\nthe edges of expanding regions where gas has been compressed and cooled. The relationship between the\nlocation of the LV system ionized filaments, disturbed X-ray emitting gas, and the non-thermal radio source\nall are consistent with the ionized gas forming where the relativistic plasma recently displaced the hot ICM\n(B\u00f6hringer et al. 1993; Churazov et al. 2000; see \u00a74.1). It is not clear how these concentric ionized features\ncould be produced via an inward moving cooling flow, unless they represented regions where the flow was\ndecelerated by an outward pressure, a model that is conceptually the same as that for an expanding source.\nThe widths of the filaments vary between > 0.5h100 \u22121 kpc in clumps of material, to unresolved features\nwith sizes of < 165h100 \u22121 pc further out in the cluster. Any explanation for their origin must account for\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\n\nthese small relative widths of the filaments in comparison to their very long lengths (ratio width/length\n> 100, especially at 50h100 \u22121 kpc, the largest distance from the center of NGC 1275 where filaments are\nseen).\nA simple model based on the measured H\u03b1 surface brightnesses of the filaments (corrected for Galactic\nextinction and assuming that about half the flux in the filter is from [N II]) indicate lower bound electron\ndensities of \u226510 cm\u22123 . The filaments are then much denser than the surrounding ICM (n\u223c10\u22122 cm\u22123 ) or\nrelativistic plasma, thus a sinking instability could operate. The pressure of these filaments is then \u2265 105\nK cm\u22123 for an electron temperature of \u223c104 K. This is below the pressure of the ICM, 106 K cm\u22123 , thus\nthe filaments could be experiencing dynamic compression. The inferred presence of a cooling flow (e.g.,\nFabian et al. 1981) would show that the ICM is not in perfect hydrostatic equilibrium, which could lead to\npressure variations over large radial scales, such as the extent of the filaments. However, the [SII] doublet\nline ratios from spectra (Heckman et al. 1989; Sabra et al. 2000), while covering only a few locations,\nindicate higher mean electron densities by as much as a factor of 10, in which case the pressure in the\nfilaments is close to that of the ICM. This also would imply a low volume filling-factor for the ionized gas\nwithin the filaments.\n\n3.1.2.\n\nPhotoionization\n\nShocks or non-thermal radiation from the AGN at the center of NGC 1275 are the most popular\nexplanations for the ionization source of the filaments (Kent and Sargent 1979, Heckman et al. 1989).\nOthers have tried to account for the high ionization flux by a merger between the HV and LV velocity\ncomponents (Hu et al. 1983), or processes associated with the ICM, such as X-ray photoionization or\nheating by magnetic reconnections (Heckman et al. 1989, Sabra et al. 2000). However, as emphasized by\nSabra et al. none of these mechanisms readily lead to the observed emission line intensity ratios in the\nfilaments.\nFigure 7 presents another way to test ionization models. We plot the observed surface brightness\nprofile of the H\u03b1 flux around NGC 1275 and compare it with the predictions of a simple central source\nphotoionization model, where the rate of ionization equals the rate of recombinations. We assume for the\npurposes of this plot a distribution of HI that falls off quadratically with spatial distance from the center;\nthe actual form we adopt is not important here since, as can be understood from Figure 7, unless the HI\nis of uniform density, an unlikely case, this model fails to provide an explanation for the observed Halpha\ndistribution.\nThe observed H-alpha intensity profile, in elliptical apertures, centered on NGC 1275 is indicated in\nred in Figure 7. The result depends sensitively on sky subtraction and thus becomes rather noisy at large\nradii. The dashed line shows the predicted flux from an isotropic central ionization source, normalized3 at\nR = 0, without any radiative losses other than r\u22122 dimming. This is an upper limit to any isotropic central\nionization source.\nThere is a clear shortfall in the model predictions at large radii. This is compounded by the fact\nthat the decline in observed mean intensity is due in large part to a decline in projected filling factor, as\nshown by the blue curve and right-hand scale in Figure 7, and not in the decline in the mean intensity of\n3R\n\ndenotes the projected radius, while r is the physical radius.\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\n\nan emitting filament. From Table 1 we see that the mean brightness of typical filaments drops by only a\nfactor of a few between the inner and outer regions of the filament system. Dust could be affecting the\ndistribution of H\u03b1 flux, but not to the extent seen in Figure 7 since the dust is largely localized near the\nHV system (see the B\u2212R color map in Figure 8 and Keel & White 2001).\nThe H\u03b1 surface brightness in the filaments is nearly always significantly higher, sometimes well over a\nfactor of \u223c100, than that predicted by a central ionization source model. If the source were beamed, this\nproblem might be avoided, but but it is not clear how a beamed photoionization source could power the\nextensive system of ionized filaments surrounding NGC 1275. Furthermore, the presence of bright, compact\nemission knots outside of the inner filament system is difficult to understand in any model with a central\nsource of photoionization. Hence we conclude, in agreement with Heckman et al. (1989), that the AGN at\nthe center of NGC 1275 is unable to ionize the filaments, and it is likely that the ionization source, while\nnot a pure shock, is physically associated with the filaments (see also Sabra et al. 2000).\n\n3.2.\n\nStar Clusters and Stellar Features\n\nThe nature of young star clusters associated with NGC 1275 has been widely discussed, beginning\nwith the discovery of HII regions by Shields & Filippenko (1990) and becoming more vigorous following\nthe first HST imaging of this system by Holtzman et al. (1992). Holtzman et al. (1992) characterized a\npopulation of blue, possibly young, clusters near the core and suggested that some of these have sizes and\nstellar masses which would allow them to evolve into globular star clusters. Later studies measured physical\nparameters of these clusters, such as age and luminosity, to determine the star and cluster formation rate,\nand constrain the physics behind their formation, e.g., star formation induced from galaxy mergers, or\ncooling flows (Richer et al. 1993; Norgaard-Nielsen et al. 1993; Faber 1993; Brodie et al. 1998; Carlson et\nal. 1998).\nThe spectra and colors of the clusters suggest rather short-lived epochs of cluster formation, rather\nthan the continuous formation expected in cooling flow models (e.g., Holtzman et al. 1992; Carlson et al.\n1998; Brodie et al. 1998). Other observations and studies go further, interpreting the narrow range of\ncolors as implying that these clusters formed through merger events (Holtzman et al. 1992; Faber 1993;\nCarlson et al. 1998). This conclusion has been disputed based on other photometric studies (e.g., Richer\net al. 1993) that find a range of colors. The accuracy of the photometry has however been debated in the\nliterature (Faber 1993; Brodie et al. 1998). The presence of young objects is compellingly demonstrated by\nthe WFPC2 photometry of Carlson et al. (1998), who find a bimodal distribution of cluster colors with a\npopulation of blue clusters with colors B\u2212R \u2248 0.3\u00b10.2.\nSince some uncertainties remain regarding photometry for the brightest cluster complexes, we have\nmeasured B and R magnitudes for the brighter clusters in the main body and for the asymmetric stellar\nfeatures in NGC 1275. We also present the first results for objects in the blue star forming extensions of\nNGC 1275. The clusters measured are labeled in Figures 8 and 9, and are listed in Table 2. These specific\nclusters are among the brightest in the NGC 1275 system. These clusters are not located in regions of strong\nemission from ionized gas, which would contribute extra light to both the B and R bands. Line emission is\nthus unlikely to be a substantial source of error in our colors, which are dominated by uncertainties in the\ncomplex continuum backgrounds. We therefore do not attempt to correct for any line emission associated\nwith the individual clusters.\nAccurate photometry of the NGC 1275 star clusters is highly compromised by the 'irregular' nature\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\n\nof the highly structured inner parts of NGC 1275, a result of dust, star formation and other features. To\nremove these we first subtract out all asymmetric parts from NGC 1275 and then fit isophotes to the\n'symmetric' residual image. We then subtract out these fitted isophotes from the original image. Aperture\nphotometry, with a 1.2\u2032\u2032 aperture, is then performed on the clusters in this subtracted image.\n\n3.2.1.\n\nInner Regions\n\nThe inner star clusters whose colors we measure are labeled on Figure 9, and listed in Table 2. The\nmajority of these clusters have similar colors, with (B\u2212R)0 \u223c 0.3 - 0.7, with a few blue clusters with\n(B\u2212R)0 \u223c 0.0. This is similar to the broad distribution found by Carlson et al. (1998) for the bright, blue\nclusters.4 Photometry of the inner clusters is also presented in Holtzman et al. (1992), Richer et al. (1993),\nNorgaard-Nielsen et al. (1993) and Brodie et al. (1998). A comparison to these studies can be effectively\ndone using Table 2 of Brodie et al. (1998). The rough corresponding objects in our Table 2, in comparison\nto those of Brodie et al. (1998: Table 2), are objects 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 with H2, H3, H4+9, H1, H6, and H5.\nThe average absolute differences between our photometry and the HST photometry of Brodie et al. (1998),\nusing the same Galactic extinction corrections, is \u223c 0.24 mag in the B and R bands with \u03c3B,R = 0.28 and\n0.26. The average color difference is (B\u2212R)Brodie - (B\u2212R)ThisPaper \u223c 0.20. Given the slightly different filter\nsystems and approaches used to measuring photometry, we a priori would not expect to measure exactly\nthe same values. The values are, however, consistent within the quoted errors of each measurement. The\nblue colors match those expected for rather young, aged < 500 Myr, clusters, and the implications of a\nrather homogeneous population of young clusters will be discussed in \u00a74.2.\n\n3.2.2.\n\nOuter Stellar Regions\n\nThe pioneering U-band images taken by MOS96 detected extended blue regions in NGC 1275 that\nare not associated with the ionized filaments. We also detect new outer star clusters, shown in Figure\n8 and labeled as clusters 17 - 22 in Table 2, that are roughly 1\u2032 from the center of NGC 1275. These\nfeatures clearly extend beyond the main stellar body of NGC 1275 as seen in Figure 1 and in the B\u2212R\ncolor map (Figure 8). We measure very blue colors with (B\u2212R)0 \u223c \u22120.3 to 0.0 (Table 2), consistent with\nan age of < 100 Myr, younger than the inner clusters. However, differential reddening may also be partially\nresponsible for these color differences, thus we can not rule out the possibility that they are coeval systems.\nThe distinction of these clusters from the ionized filaments is demonstrated by comparing Figures 2\nand 8, where the H\u03b1+[NII] emission and blue continuum are shown. The two main regions of extended star\nformation have approximate mirror symmetry around the center of NGC 1275, consistent with an origin\nfrom either tidal arms/streamers from a galaxy merger, or effects of a bi-polar jet from the nucleus. The\nloop or 'arm' structure in the southeastern region \"A\" favors the jet model, where stars could be produced\naround an expanding cocoon driven by a relativistic plasma (see \u00a74.2). The northwestern blue region \"B\"\nhas a linear structure that could also result from either process.\nRegion \"A\" in Figure 8 has a projected linear extent of \u22488h100 \u22121 kpc and region \"B\" has a projected\nsize of \u224815h100 \u22121 kpc. These features are as narrow as 0.5 kpc in some places and are often sharply\ndefined. Such crisp structures cannot last very long in the absence of additional support, such as magnetic\n4 Carlson\n\net al. also detected a population of faint red clusters that we do not consider here.\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\nfields. For a typical projected distance of 15-20h100\u22121 kpc for the outer parts of these features, the orbital\nperiod will be \u223c0.5 Gyr, which sets an upper limit to their lifetimes.\nThe separation of these zones from the current locations of the bright radio lobes and ionized filaments\n(MOS96) also suggests that if causally connected the relativistic outflow in NGC 1275 has undergone\nmultiple changes in direction in the last orbital period, or the filaments formed by some other process. We\nalso note the presence of a redder, fainter, and more diffuse plume or arrow (Figure 8), extending from the\nnucleus to the south-southwest. This might be an example of a somewhat older jet-induced star forming\nregion, or a remnant of the stellar disk of an accreted galaxy.\n\n3.3.\n\nThe High Velocity System\n\nThe HV (8200 km s\u22121 ) emission line system can potentially be explained by the superposition of a\nhighly distorted foreground late-type galaxy. This hypothesis has gained acceptance from observational\nevidence, including the localized position of the HV lines at the northwest corner of NGC 1275 (Rubin et\nal. 1977, Caulet et al. 1992), HI and X-ray absorption against the radio source indicating that the HV\nsystem is in the foreground (DeYoung et al. 1973; Fabian et al. 2000), possible rotation of the HV system\n(Rubin et al. 1977, Boroson 1990), optical dust lanes and absorption consistent with a late-type galaxy\n(Keel 1983; Keel & White 2001), an optical spectrum consistent with late-type HII regions without shocks\n(Kent & Sargent 1979), and a spectrum with ordinary stellar Ca II triplet absorption at \u03bb8498 and Na\nI D lines (Boroson 1990) at the same velocity as the HV system. We also observe that the star clusters\nprojected towards the HV system have blue colors with (B\u2212R)0 \u223c 0.1 - 0.4, possibly indicating an age\nslightly younger than the clusters associated with the inner LV system clusters (Table 2 & Figure 9). There\nare however very blue clusters in the outer parts of NGC 1275 that are not in the projected location of the\nHV system (\u00a73.2.1; Figure 8).\nWhat is not generally agreed upon is the role this HV system is playing in the evolution of NGC 1275.\nThe distance of the HV material from the center of NGC 1275 is an important parameter for understanding\nthis problem. A significant amount of non-thermal emission is coming from NGC 1275 at the location of the\nHV system (Pedlar et al. 1990), and a spatial correspondence may exist between the HV and LV emission\nsystems where the HV gas is present (Unger et al. 1990, Caulet et al. 1992). H\u03b1 gas with velocities\nbetween the HV and LV system also exists (Ferruit et al. 1997), suggesting a possible connection. These\nobservations allow for the possibility that some interaction is occurring between the HV system and the\nmain NGC 1275 system (see Boroson 1990 and references therein; Fabian et al. 2000), and led Pedlar et al.\n(1999) to conclude that the HV system is probably infalling and within 30 kpc of the NGC 1275 nucleus.\nWhile an infalling galaxy is an attractive model for the HV system, it has not yet been established how\nit would fully describe the many peculiarities of the HV material. The ionized gas properties of the HV\nsystem suggest that it could be a moderate-size, late-type field galaxy (Unger et al. 1990). However, the\nestimated rotational velocity of 300 km s\u22121 would be high for such an object. Others have also argued that\nthe HI gas content is too low (van Gorkom & Ekers 1983) for a late-type galaxy, although gas depletion\nwould be expected for an infalling galaxy only \u223c 30 kpc from the cluster core. The structure of the original\nHV object is likely further obscured by perturbations produced by the environment near NGC 1275.\nOther distorted galaxies exist near NGC 1275 (Conselice & Gallagher 1999), demonstrating that this\ncan be a hostile location for smaller galaxies. The large inferred cooling flow in the ICM would imply a\nhigher density ICM (e.g. Fabian et al. 1981; White & Sarazin 1988) offering an efficient mechanism for\n\n\f\u2013 10 \u2013\n\nremoving interstellar gas from an infalling galaxy and thereby further distorting the system. For example,\nit is possible that a field galaxy interacted with NGC 1275, leaving behind an infalling trail of stripped gas\nthat we see as the HV gas system. Such a feature should be short lived; whether a tidal tail could survive\nthe supersonic passage through the ICM is not obvious, thus models where the gas is strongly bound, such\nas in a galaxy, perhaps are better candidates for explaining the HV system in a collisional model.\nRecently, Dupke & Bregman (2001) discovered X-ray emission to the east and south of NGC 1275\nredshifted by several thousand km s\u22121 with respect to the cluster's central velocity. This material therefore\noverlaps in velocity with the HV system, but perhaps not spatially. Dupke & Bregman interpret the large\npeculiar velocities as evidence for an off-center merger in the Perseus cluster by a group or subcluster.\nHowever, they do not consider the possibility of a connection to the HV system, whose characteristics also\nsuggest an association with some type of merger process that could be a source of the HV material.\n\n3.4.\n\nMotion of the Low Velocity Ionized Gas\n\nThe Densepak integral field unit on the WIYN telescope was used to map the LV gas velocity field\nwithin NGC 1275 (see \u00a72). Figure 10 shows the outlines of the positions of the fibers on Densepak over the\ncentral 30\u2032\u2032 \u00d7 40\u2032\u2032 of NGC 1275, while Figure 11 shows the measured velocity distribution. Table 3 lists the\npositions and velocity values of the gas observed in each fiber.\nThe velocities across the central 0.33\u2032 of the ionized gas around NGC 1275 range from 4800 km s\u22121 to\n5500 km s\u22121 . A rough velocity gradient can be seen across the area, with higher velocities in the northeast,\nabout 20\u2032\u2032 north of the center of NGC 1275, while there is a minimum velocity near 5000 km s\u22121 in the\nsouthwest area5 . The average velocity in each indicated 10\u2032\u20322 region is also indicated. The ionized gas in\nthe inner 30\u2032\u2032 of NGC 1275 could have either a component of rotation about an axis with a position angle\nof \u223c 120\u25e6 , or is involved in a bipolar outflow/inflow. This is similar to the position angle of one of the\ninner streamers and roughly consistent with rotational flattening responsible for the east-west orientation of\nthe ionized gas complex near the center of NGC 1275. This elongated structure has earlier been recognized\nas a possible consequence of rotation (e.g. Cowie et al. 1983). Bridges & Irwin (1998) showed that\nNGC 1275 contains about 1010 M\u2299 of molecular gas in its inner parts, with a similar velocity field and\nspatial distribution to those of the much smaller mass of ionized gas studied here.\nThe alignment of both the ionized and molecular inner gas along the major axis of NGC 1275,\nroughly orthogonal to the direction of the radio jets, the large mass of gas in this region, and its velocity\namplitude suggest that this gas is a rotating structure rather than an outflow. The rotation amplitude of\n250 km s\u22121 over a radius of \u223c7 kpc implies a dynamical mass of 1011 M\u2299 . The angular momentum of\nthe inner ionized gas appears to be comparable to that of a typical giant spiral galaxy. While this might\nresult from a cooling flow (e.g. Fabian & Nulsen 1977; Mathews & Bregman 1978) or from a merger with\na galaxy, it is not obvious in either case whether or not the gas could align itself along the major axis of\nNGC 1275 sufficiently rapidly. Whatever the origin of the central gas complex in NGC 1275, it clearly\nhas existed with little or no radial motion for a sufficient time to allow it to orbit NGC 1275 and form a\npartially relaxed system near the center of the galaxy; the orbital time of \u223c100 Myr sets the minimum time\nscale for this event. Like previous authors, we find a complicated velocity field, suggesting that the inner\ngas in NGC 1275 is perturbed, possibly by the AGN (Heckman et al. 1989; Bridges & Irwin 1998) or by\n5 This\n\ngradient is difficult to see in gray scale versions of this figure.\n\n\f\u2013 11 \u2013\n\nrecent merger(s).\n\n4.\n4.1.\n\nDiscussion\n\nExcitation of the Low-Velocity Emission Lines\n\nEmission line intensities from the LV system present as much of a problem as does its spectacular\nmorphology. Optical spectroscopy of NGC 1275 by Kent & Sargent (1979) led them to conclude that the\nLV filaments could be powered by either photo-ionization from the active BL Lac nucleus, or result from\nshocked gas. Further analyses by Heckman et al. (1989) and Sabra et al. (2000) also suggest that a\ncombination of shocks and photo-ionization could contribute to making the NGC 1275 filaments, but that\nneither of these processes alone would suffice.\nA key feature is the wide range in filament ionization levels, with pronounced emission from [OI]\nand [NI] coexisting with [OIII] and [NeIII]. Figure 12 shows an example of our Kitt Peak spectra of the\nNGC 1275 filaments. Since the ionization levels of H and O are linked by charge exchange reactions, the\npresence of strong [OI] emission proves that warm neutral gas is present in the filaments. By analogy with\nconditions in the Crab nebula (Sankrit et al. 1998), we are likely seeing ionized sheaths surrounding neutral\nfilament cores. Thus the density structures of the filaments could play an important role in determining the\nemitted spectrum, and may be obscuring the ionization mechanisms.\nFurther complications arise from the short recombination and cooling time scales for the filaments. The\nrecombination time is \u223c 105 yr/(ne cm\u22123 ) and the cooling time of the ionized gas, if anything, is shorter\nthan this (cf. Osterbrock 1989), so there must be a power source to keep the filaments ionized, or they must\nbe re-formed on comparable time scales. However, the cooling time for the hot ICM near NGC 1275 is\n\u2248 1 Gyr (e.g., Fabian et al. 2000; Dupke & Bregman 2001). In the (unlikely) circumstance of no additional\nheating, the filaments would become neutral much more rapidly than they could be replenished from the\nICM. The presence of a spatially coherent system whose extent in light years is larger than their \u223c104 yr\ncooling time would be a major puzzle. Evidently the evolution of the filaments is slowed by a source of heat.\nHow was gas compressed by factors of >103 , to the point where it becomes neutral, in a location\nwhere external heating is obviously present? One example of such a process operates in the Crab nebula\nto create the well-known network of thermal gas filaments (Sankrit et al. 1998) thus the situation is not\nan impossible one. The ICM around NGC 1275 is the most likely source of gas for the filaments, but then\nwhat fills the role of the expanding relativistic plasma in the Crab to cause the ICM in the Perseus cluster\nto condense into filaments?\nOur working hypothesis for filament formation follows the suggestion of MOS96 that the gas filaments\naround NGC 1275 are produced by an interaction between the ICM and relativistic plasma ejected from\nthe active nucleus of NGC 1275. In this \"Crab-like\" model, the relativistic plasma has (or had) a higher\npressure than the ICM and therefore displaces it. How this occurs depends on the expansion velocity of\nthe relativistic plasma; if it is supersonic relative to the ICM, then we would expect shocks to form at the\nICM/plasma interface, but the ICM would be compressed even if the expansion were sub-sonic.\n\n\f\u2013 12 \u2013\n\n4.1.1.\n\nRelativistic Plasma-ICM Interactions\n\nInteractions between jets of relativistic plasma and ambient gas in and around radio galaxies are\nrelatively common; e.g., in Minkowski's object (van Breugel et al. 1985), Hydra A (McNamara et al. 2000)\nand Centaurus A (Graham & Price 1981; Morganti et al. 1991; Graham 1998; Mould et al. 2000), where\nthey produce star formation and optical emission line regions. Relativistic plasma ejected from the nuclei\nof radio galaxies also affects the X-ray emitting thermal gas in several galaxies (e.g. B\u00f6hringer et al. 1993;\nCarilli et. al. 1994; Rizza et al. 2000; McNamara et. al. 2000).\nX-ray and radio maps of NGC 1275 (B\u00f6hringer 1993, Pedlar et al. 1990, MOS96, Fabian et al. 2000)\nindicate this type of event may have occurred around NGC 1275. These maps reveal that the radio plasma\nseems to have displaced the X-ray emitting gas around the northern and southern bases of the filament\nsystem. The linear extension of filaments to the north aligns with faint emission seen at low frequencies,\npossibly the remnants of a former jet structure (Blundell, Kassim, & Perley 2000). The H\u03b1 emission largely\navoids both the current radio lobes and the surrounding X-ray bright areas, but often are exterior to these\nregions, as expected if they form in displaced gas.\nA simple model for this type of interaction is that a near spherical bubble of relativistic gas expands\nfrom the galaxy into its surroundings. This bubble or \"cocoon\" is powered by a jet from the active galactic\nnucleus (Pedlar et al. 1990; Heinz et al. 1998). The kinetic energy input to the relativistic plasma is\nestimated to currently be about 1043 erg s\u22121 in NGC 1275 (Pedlar et al. 1990), similar to the energy\nreleased from the cooling ICM gas. It is therefore energetically possible for the relativistic plasma to\ninfluence the ICM. The size of the cocoon at the time it detaches from the jet can be estimated, following\nChurazov et al. (2000), to be about 50 kpc in NGC 1275.\nPossibly a cocoon displaced the hot ICM surrounding the center of NGC 1275 (B\u00f6hringer 1993,\nMOS96). In principle an expanding cocoon could produce large scale shocks, a key aspect of the Heinz et\nal. (1998) model. Recent observations with Chandra of NGC 1275 reveal neither evidence for strong shocks\nbetween the radio lobes and the ICM, nor indications that the radio lobes are expanding supersonically\n(Fabian et al. 2000). From these data and the results of Sabra et al. (2000) it seems unlikely that shocks\nare currently the major factor in the filament system. However, shocks could have occurred in the past\nif we are witnessing a late phase of the interaction between the radio lobes and the ICM, after the main\nexpansion stage, as in the evolutionary models of NGC 1275 presented by Reynolds, Heinz, & Begelman\n(2001).\nClearly the production of filaments involves complex physical processes, and more so if, as is likely,\nmagnetic fields are a significant factor. However, once cool material is produced, it will be much denser than\nits surroundings. This material is likely to be subject to Rayleigh-Taylor and Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities,\nwhich will act to further concentrate the cooling gas (e.g., B\u00f6hringer & Morfill 1998). The combination\nof large scale gas compression from supersonically expanding radio lobes and subsequent instabilities can\nplausibly lead to the spectacular NGC 1275 filament system as suggested by MOS96.\nWhile the conceptual model of a radio lobe-ICM interaction producing filaments is attractive, some\nimportant issues are unresolved. Most critical is whether the hot ICM can be sufficiently compressed along\nthe boundary of a cocoon so as to cool rapidly enough to create the ionized filaments. For an intrinsic ICM\ncooling time near the main body of NGC 1275 of <1 Gyr (Fabian et al. 2000), we require compression\nfactors of \u223c10 for the gas cooling time to be shorter than the dynamical time scales of \u2248100 Myr (see\n\u00a73.1.1). A strong adiabatic shock produces a factor of 4 increase in density. Thus, with even modest\n\n\f\u2013 13 \u2013\npost-shock cooling, the compressed gas will be able to drop to temperatures of \u2264 106 K during the required\ntime interval. At this point the cooling rate greatly increases due atomic line emission, and the thermal\ntime scales decrease by at least a factor of 10. In addition, the expanding relativistic gas could uplift cool,\ndense material from the inner parts of the system, as suggested by Churazov et al. (2000), and thereby\nprovide another source of dense material for making filaments.\nIn this model the filaments come from the ICM, thus it can be tested by comparing the chemical\nabundances of species in the filaments and the ICM. If this model were accurate the two abundance\nmeasurements would be similar. Based on the Perseus cluster ICM chemical abundances measured by\nDupke & Arnaud (2001), we would expect the filaments to contain gas with about half of the solar oxygen\nabundance. Another test can be made by estimating pressures within the filaments. If they form from\ninstabilities in the ICM and are long-lived, then they will be in approximate pressure equilibrium with\ntheir surroundings. As we saw in \u00a73.1.1, if the electron densities are as high as the allowed upper limits of\nne \u2248100 cm\u22123 given by the [SII] doublet emission line ratios, then the pressures could be roughly equal\nbetween the filaments and ICM. We conclude that current observations neither eliminate this model, nor\nsuffice to fully establish its veracity.\n\n4.2.\n\nRecent Galaxy Accretion in the NGC 1275 System\n4.2.1.\n\nThe LV System\n\nWhile NGC 1275 has neither the colors nor the spectrum of a classical elliptical galaxy (e.g. van den\nBergh 1977; Wirth et al. 1983; Romanishin 1987), it does have an R1/4 radial surface brightness profile,\ntypical of giant ellipticals, in its inner regions (e.g., Schombert 1986; Prestwich et al. 1997). However, an\nr1/4 profile can form on short time scales during mergers between disk galaxies, and is often found in recent\nmergers, such as Arp 220 and NGC 7252 (Schweizer 1998). Therefore this feature alone does not tell us if\nNGC 1275 is fundamentally an ancient elliptical galaxy.\nHoltzman et al. (1992) presented convincing evidence, from images taken with the Wide Field\nPlanetary Camera 2 (WFPC2) on the Hubble Space Telescope, that NGC 1275 contains complicated internal\nstellar structures. They found what appears to be a spiral arm, or a diffuse asymmetric light feature, near\nthe center of NGC 1275, as well as two ripple patterns to the southeast of the center of the galaxy. We\ndetect in our data two new ripple features (or rings), for a total of four (see Figure 8). We further identify\ntwo diffuse \"arms\" (Figure 8 & 9), one more than Holtzman et al. (1992), with an additional third small\n\"arm\" in between. These \"arm\" features have a surface brightness \u03bcB \u223c 22 mag arcsec\u22122 , with moderately\nblue colors, (B\u2212R)0 \u223c 0.30, suggesting that the stars in the 'arms' are the same age as the clusters. The\nmagnitude of each arm is about B = 20.6, or MB \u223c \u221214. These 'arms' could have formed from gas\nimported from the accreted galaxy, while the ripple features are potentially from the old stellar component.\nThe luminosities of the arms suggests that the accreted object could be either a dwarf galaxy, or disrupted\nyoung luminous star clusters.\nThe small scale features in the main body of NGC 1275 support the idea that this galaxy experienced\na merger with a galaxy that contained a non-negligible stellar mass, but likely with a significantly lower\nmass than NGC 1275 (cf. Schweizer & Seitzer 1988).\nCarlson et al. (1989) describe a large population of blue, B\u2212R \u2248 0.3, star clusters with ages \u223c300\nMyr. There is very little spread in the colors of these bright star clusters, hence they could have all been\n\n\f\u2013 14 \u2013\n\ncreated at nearly the same time, although uncertainties in internal extinction and background subtraction\nmake precise age-dating of the star clusters difficult (Holtzman et al. 1992; Carlson et al. 1989). Corrected\nfor Galactic extinction, but uncorrected for internal extinction or background light, we find that most star\nclusters in this region have (B\u2212R)0 \u223c 0.3 - 0.7, and absolute magnitudes MB \u223c \u221212 to \u221215, corresponding\nto ages of <1 Gyr for metallicities of >0.1 solar (Kurth et al. 1999). Based on these ages, it seems likely\nthat the most recently completed merger in NGC 1275 took place about 300 Myr ago.\nWe find further support for this merger being either a recent minor or old major one, in a relative\nsense, by the use of a color-asymmetry diagram (CAD). The CAD is a diagnostic tool for determining\nphysical properties of galaxies based on the quantitative parameters of asymmetry and color (see Conselice\n1997 and Conselice et al. 2000a). Briefly, this approach takes advantage of the natural correlation between\nmean color and degree of organization in normal galaxies that is broken when a galaxy is disturbed by\ninteractions, which produce higher levels of disorganization than in a normal galaxy of the same color. The\norganization of the galaxy is measured in terms of an asymmetry parameter (Conselice et al. 2000a).\nAmong other properties, many nearby galaxies that do not fit on or near the CAD normal galaxy\nfiducial sequence (dashed line in Figure 13) are undergoing an interaction or recent merger (Conselice\net al. 2000a,b). NGC 1275, within a radius that excludes the HV system, has an asymmetry value of\nA = 0.16 \u00b1 0.01. Asymmetries are computed by rotating an image by 180\u25e6 , subtracting the rotated image\nfrom the original, and then by taking the ratio of the absolute value of the sum of these residuals to the\ntotal flux of the galaxy. NGC 1275 has a color (B \u2212 V )0 = 0.72\u00b10.03, corrected for internal and galactic\nextinction (de Vaucouleurs et al. 1991). These asymmetry and color values do not put NGC 1275 in the\narea of major mergers (Figure 13, Conselice et al. 2000b), but its asymmetry is somewhat large for what\nis clearly an underlying spheroidal galaxy, indicating the presence of the faint peculiar rings representing\na small perturbation in the mainly symmetric galaxy. The other galaxies in Figure 13 have asymmetries\nmeasured at larger radii, where mixing times are longer, than where we measure NGC 1275's value.\nNGC 1275 is thus even more asymmetric, in a relative sense, than that implied by examining its position\non Figure 13.\nThe broad range of estimated clusters ages around NGC 1275 (Richer et al. 1993; Kaisler et al. 1996)\npossibly requires an extended star formation history that might not be associated with recent mergers. In\nthe future wide-field high resolution images and integral field spectroscopy of NGC 1275 will allow closer\nexamination of this formation process through a determination of its star cluster formation history.\n\n4.2.2.\n\nThe HV System\n\nIn Figure 8, we note the area of the HV foreground 'galaxy' in our color image of NGC 1275. This\nappears as extra blue light in the northwest quadrant of NGC 1275, where MOS96 also noted a possible\ncoincidence of blue light with the HV emission line system. While we cannot rule out the possibility that\nsome of the excess light in the northwest quadrant is from star formation in the LV system, its location\nsuggests a possible connection with the HV system.\nThis asymmetric components in this area appears bluer than the rest of NGC 1275 (MOS96) as is\nreadily seen in the B\u2212R color map. If this is the possible HV foreground galaxy, then it contains several\nthick dust lanes (Keel 1983; Keel & White 2001) and star clusters. These clusters are not present in the H\u03b1\nimage of the LV emission from NGC 1275, although some of these clusters are at the LV system redshift of\n\u223c 5200 km s\u22121 (Carlson et al. 1998; Brodie et al. 1998). Confirmation of which star clusters are in the HV\n\n\f\u2013 15 \u2013\n\nsystem will require further spectroscopy for radial velocity measurements.\nThe non-detection in the LV H\u03b1 and the spatial coincidence with the HV system lends credibility to\nthe possibility that some of the star clusters and the underlying starlight could be the remains of the galaxy\nresponsible for the HV emission. The blue light that could be part of the HV system does not resemble\nany normal galaxy. The star-forming knots are aligned parallel to dust lane features (Figure 8), suggestive\nof the pattern seen in the arms of spiral galaxies, while the distorted shape of the overall system suggests\nthat dynamical disruption has occurred. Keel and White (2001) further suggest that the highly correlated\nspatial positions of the dust lanes near the HV system and clusters are strong evidence for an association.\nIn any case, whether LV or HV, these star clusters have essentially the same colors as the spectroscopically\nconfirmed (Brodie et al. 1998) LV clusters (Table 2). Interpreted as similar ages, this would imply a\ncoincidence in the epoch of cluster formation. This could arise as a result of an interaction between the\ngaseous components of the LV and HV systems, perhaps indicated by the presence of H\u03b1 gas at velocities\nbridging those of the two systems (Ferruit et al. 1997).\nCluster formation in a burst of star formation associated with the infall process is also plausible. It\nwould be useful to seek older, redder clusters with high radial velocities as a means to identify an underlying\nold HV system stellar population that would be an unambiguous signature of a galactic source for the HV\nstars, versus for example, star formation stimulated by a jet.\nThe interaction of a late-type field spiral falling towards NGC 1275 would be further complicated\nby the effects of gas stripping mechanisms. In addition to the usual ram pressure and other gas removal\nmechanisms associated with a rapid passage through the ICM (whose density would be boosted by the\ncooling flow), an infalling galaxy also could interact with the expanding relativistic plasma from the AGN\nin NGC 1275 (Churazov et al. 2000). These stripping processes also offer an explanation for the depleted\nlevel of HI gas in the HV system found by van Gorkom and Ekers (1983). If some of the gas forms stars\nduring the interaction/stripping, which must be associated with shocks given the clearly supersonic relative\nvelocities, then the HV stellar populations produced would have unusual spatial distributions and should\nbe no older than the time since the infalling galaxy entered the cluster.\nIn summary, our observations allow a model where the HV system towards NGC 1275 was produced by\nan infalling galaxy. Identification of pre-infall HV stellar populations or star clusters with ages of >few Gyr\nwould be consistent with this hypothesis. Until then the possibility remains that the HV system formed by\na more exotic process, such as an interaction between a jet from the AGN and something else (galaxy, gas\ncloud) in the vicinity of NGC 1275. However, an additional hint that the HV system might be part of a\nsingle event comes from the high redshift X-ray emission component in the Perseus cluster found by Dupke\n& Bregman (2001).\n\n5.\n\nSummary and Discussion\n\nIn this paper we present new observations of the bizarre NGC 1275 system in the Perseus cluster of\ngalaxies. High quality WIYN Telescope images of the LV system of ionized gas filaments allow important\nstructural distinctions to be made. We show that filaments have roughly constant surface brightness along\ntheir lengths, inconsistent with photoionization directly from the AGN (see also Heckman et al. 1989; Sabra\net al. 2000). Tangential filaments generally curve around the central galaxy, suggesting gas compression\nby an outflow from NGC 1275 rather than cooling in a pure inflow. Filaments also show rich structures,\nincluding bright knots, to the limits of our angular resolution (\u223c150h100 \u22121 pc).\n\n\f\u2013 16 \u2013\n\nWe follow the suggestion of MOS96 in interpreting the tangential filaments as regions where the\nexpanding relativistic plasma from the AGN in NGC 1275 displaced and compressed the ICM, which then\nrapidly cooled (B\u00f6hringer et al. 1993; Heinz et al. 1998; Churazov et al. 2000; Fabian et al. 2000). Gas\nalong the boundaries of the radio lobes may be further concentrated by Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities and\nradial filaments can form from the actions of additional cooling and Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities. The\nresulting filaments are expected to consist of tubes or ribbons, likely with complex substructure and small\nionized gas filling factors. If this picture is correct, then we expect the gas in the filaments to have the\nsame abundances as the ICM from which they formed, and to be in approximate pressure equilibrium with\ntheir surroundings. Abundances, excitation and ionization states for tangential and radial filaments should\nalso be similar to one another at a given distance from the center of NGC 1275. Problems remain with this\nmodel, for example it does not suggest how long the filaments should last. The lifetime would depend on\nhow stable the radio output is, where the ionization comes from, magnetic fields, etc., all things we do not\ncompletely understand yet. Future measurements of the internal velocities of individual components of the\nfilaments will provide useful insights into these problems. For near pressure equilibrium models, internal\nspeeds will be roughly sonic, while bulk motions can be much faster, albeit still sub-sonic with respect to\nthe medium in which the moving filaments are embedded.\nThe source of filament ionization is not completely understood, but is unlikely to be a simple result\nof either shocks or photoionization (cf., Sabra et al. 2000). However, any heating process cannot be too\neffective since the [OI] and [NI] emission indicate the presence of neutral gas within the filaments. It is\ntherefore possible that the filaments hide a significant gas mass within their neutral cores. However, we find\nonly a few examples of blue stars associated with ionized filaments, thus they generally are not so dense as\nto support extensive star formation.\nOur data agree with the MOS96 finding that in the past, dense filaments probably were sites of\nstar formation outside of the main body of NGC 1275. Two regions containing young blue star clusters\nextend over \u223c 5 kpc on either side of the main body of NGC 1275. The existence of star formation in\ngas compressed by the relativistic plasma of a radio source would not be unique to NGC 1275, but we do\nnot yet properly understand this process. It is not obvious why extensive star formation occurred in some\nregions in the relatively recent past (<1 Gyr on the basis of B\u2212R colors and dynamical evolution time scale\narguments), but not at the present time.\nWe further demonstrate that morphological properties of the inner portions of NGC 1275's ripples (or\nrings; Figure 8) are consistent with a recent minor merger (see Schweizer & Seitzer 1988). From the sizes\nof these tidal features we estimate that the merger is no older than a few \u00d7108 years, the same age as the\nblue star clusters, and thus a likely cause of the star formation, blue colors and A-type spectrum seen in\nthe central regions of NGC 1275. Rich star clusters are frequently observed in interacting/merging galaxies\n(e.g., Whitmore 2000). Moreover, gravitational instability can occur within tidal tails (e.g., Duc and\nMirabel 1999) perhaps providing an explanation for the spatially extended blue stellar features we identify.\nIf this past event also produced an outburst from the AGN, it could unify the properties of NGC 1275 by\ncreating radio lobes, and therefore ionized filaments.\nUsing the WIYN integral field spectrograph, we measure the velocity structure of the inner part of\nthe LV ionized gas, finding evidence for rotation in an otherwise chaotic velocity field, where the velocity\nspread is \u2248250 km s\u22121 . The velocity field in the inner ionized gas is similar to that of the much larger mass\nof molecular gas in the same area (Bridges & Irwin 1998). The east-west extension of the inner complex of\nionized gas could reflect the influence of rotational flattening, suggesting that this gas reservoir is partially\nrelaxed. It is not clear where the huge amount of cool ISM within NGC 1275 came from. If it is due to the\n\n\f\u2013 17 \u2013\n\ncooling flow, then a process must exist to align the gas angular momentum vector with the minor axis of\nthe stellar body of NGC 1275 before the gas has settled into a dynamically cool disk. The large amount\nof dust in this material also requires that extensive star formation took place to pollute what should have\nbeen relatively dust-free gas from the ICM. If a significant part of the ISM in NGC 1275 was supplied by\nmergers, then the merged galaxies must have been extremely gas rich, or were possibly a small group of gas\nrich systems, that could also produce the large velocity gradient seen in the Perseus cluster X-ray gas by\nDupke & Bregman (2001).\nThe excess stellar surface brightness distribution near the HV ionized is distorted and asymmetric with\nblue optical colors, as previously discussed by MOS96 and others. The HV system could therefore result\nfrom a galaxy interacting with NGC 1275. Star formation in the stripped ISM could be triggered by this\ninteraction, further complicating the structure of this region. Additional radial velocity measurements of\nthe excess blue starlight and a full range of star clusters can provide sharper tests of the infalling galaxy\nmodel. If the HV system is associated with the remains of an infalling galaxy that is not yet completely\ndisrupted, then NGC 1275 recently has accreted at least two galaxies \u2013 one for the HV system interacting\nwith the ICM of the cluster, and at least one more to make the ripples, rings and star clusters in its main\nbody. This would further suggests that we are seeing the final demise of a small group of galaxies that\nentered the Perseus cluster. Other galaxies with positions and velocities close to the HV system would be\nfurther evidence of this. Hierarchical clustering models of structure formation lead to the formation of\nclusters of galaxies by the merging of galaxies, so some ongoing accretion/assimilation may be expected.\nWhile tentative explanations exist for several aspects of NGC 1275, others remain as mysteries. It is\nnot clear why the core of the Perseus cluster should host strong interactions at the present epoch, especially\nsince the remainder of the cluster is remarkably free from low velocity galaxy interactions and starbursting\ngalaxies (Conselice, Gallagher, & Wyse 2001). Another problem is the presence of apparently linear dust\nlanes (Figures 1, 2 & 8), including large clumps of dust near the HV system not seen in other areas. If the\nHV system's gas and stars are being distorted by an interaction with the ICM and expanding energetic\nradio plasma, then how does the dust survive? Furthermore, neither the role, nor the extent of the cooling\nflow in Perseus is fully understood. This leads to unresolved questions as to how the cooling flow affects the\nvarious components of the cluster, particularly its inner parts in the critical region around NGC 1275 (e.g.,\nFabian et al. 2000).\nFurther observations of the Perseus cluster with X-ray satellites such as Chandra and XMM to obtain\nhigher resolution imaging and detailed abundance measurements of the ICM from X-ray spectroscopy\nshould clarify this and several other issues. Additional studies at other wavelengths are needed, including\nefforts to better define the characteristics of the young clusters, especially their ages and kinematics, as\nwell as high angular resolution observations designed to explore the internal structures of the H\u03b1 filaments.\nGaining a proper description of what is happening in and around NGC 1275 remains an important milestone\nfor understanding the evolution of central galaxies in rich clusters.\nWe thank the \"WIYN Crew\" for providing a superb and smoothly operating observatory, and Birgit\nOtte for assistance on several technical aspects of this research.

The dashed line\nshows the predicted intensity with projected radius, R, for a central ionization source model with the only\nlosses being r\u22122 dimming. Using the scale on the right, we show the upper limit to the projected ionized\ngas filling factor versus radius (blue solid line). The inner 3.8h100 \u22121 kpc is almost completely filled with\noverlapping filaments, while the outer parts of the system are very sparsely occupied. The green dotted line\nabove the mean intensity profile at larger radii illustrates the brightness that would be observed at each\nradius if the ionized gas projected filling factor were unity.
