Postal 20-364, M\u00e9xico D.F. 01000\u2217\n(Dated: July 31, 2018)\nWe introduce a relativistic version of quantum encryption protocol by considering two inertial\nobservers who wish to securely transmit quantum information encoded in a free scalar quantum field\nstate forming Minkowski particles. In a non-relativistic setting a certain amount of shared classical\nresources is necessary to perfectly encrypt the state. We show that in the case of a uniformly\naccelerated eavesdropper the communicating parties need to share (asymptotically in the limit of\ninfinite acceleration) just half of the classical resources.\nPACS numbers: 03.67.Hk, 03.65.Yz\n\nOnly relatively a small fraction of works on quantum information theory studies its various aspects in a relativistic\nsetting [1]. The violation of Bell's inequality for a quantum entangled state shared by two observers who are not\nat rest with respect to each other in special [2] or general relativity [3] attracted a bit more attention. Also, it was\nobserved that the entanglement is a quantity depending on a relative acceleration of one of the observers who, before\nbeing accelerated, shared a maximally entangled bosonic [4] or fermionic pair [5]. In the latter it was found that\nthe entanglement does not vanish even in the limit of infinite acceleration. The physical effect behind the scene\nresponsible for this behavior is the Unruh effect [6] which can be generalized into an arbitrary spacetime dimension by\nthe thermalization theorem [13]. As a seminal example of its consequences on the effectivity of quantum information\nprotocols in a relativistic setting let us recall a relativistic version of the quantum teleportation protocol [7]. In\nthis case Alice is a stationary observer sharing a maximally entangled state with Bob in the same frame. Later, Bob\nuniformly accelerates with respect to Alice and it is found that the fidelity of an input and output state is a decreasing\nfunction of Bob's acceleration. Due to the Unruh effect, Bob has no longer access to the maximally entangled state and\nthe higher acceleration he perceives the less entangled state is effectively shared by both participants. Consequently,\nthe reliability of the teleportation is reduced. Therefore, this quite different behavior from the 'standard case' leads\nus to the revision of the other quantum communication protocols.\nIn this paper we consider relativistic effects in a cryptographic protocol known as Private Quantum Channel (PQC).\nWe are interested in learning how can relativistic effects be used to relax the assumptions on classical resources needed\nfor the perfect encryption of a quantum state. It is known that for an eavesdropping in the same frame where the\ncommunication takes place two bits of shared classical information are necessary for the secure transmission of the\nstate. We have shown that the amount of the shared classical resources is reduced if the eavesdropper (Eve) is in a\nrelative uniform acceleration with respect to inertial Alice and Bob. In the limit of infinite acceleration, the classical\ncost of the secure encryption is reduced to one half. The infinite acceleration limit corresponds to a situation in\nwhich freely falling Alice and Bob (into a black hole) transmit information while Eve escaping the fall tries to tap the\ncommunication. Note that in the following analysis we will encrypt qubits but our results can be directly generalized to\nthe case of d-level states (qudits). On the other hand, the encryption of states with infinitely many degrees of freedom\n(so called continuous-variable quantum states) requires much more caution even in the non-relativistic case [9].\nThe structure of the paper is the following. In Sec. I we remind the concept of Minkowski (Rindler) particles\nas a free massless scalar field given by the quantization of a superposition of plane waves forming wave packets in\nMinkowski (Rindler) spacetime. We will employ an effect similar to the Unruh effect (derived for the single photon\nfield excitations), that is, a decomposition of the Minkowski one-particle state into the many-particle Rindler state\noccupying two causally disconnected regions. In Sec. II we recall some of the basic properties of PQCs together\nwith the justification of their use. The main part comes in Sec. III where we derive an upper bound on information\nwhich a non-inertial eavesdropper, in the limit of infinite acceleration, is able to extract from partially encrypted\ncommunication being in progress between two legal inertial observers.\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\naddress: kbradler@epot.cz\n\n\f2\nI.\n\nTRANSFORMATION OF MINKOWSKI PARTICLES INTO A NON-INERTIAL FRAME\n\nThe wave packets, whose properties will be employed, were studied in detail in [12] (and originally come from [14])\nbut for more general approach to the particle/wave packet concept in QFT we refer to Takagi's noticeable earlier\npaper [13]. The used wave packets have the usual form of a superposition of plane waves in both spacetimes modulated\nby Fourier coefficients with a simple structure. The quantization was performed for a free massless scalar bosonic\nfield and the resulting objects in Minkowski spacetime are known as Minkowski particles (and similarly for Rindler\nspacetime). Such an object is spatially and temporarily localized and thus allows us to talk about preparation,\nmanipulation and measurement as known from non-relativistic quantum mechanics. This is not possible with a single\nfield excitation (Fock state) as understood by QFT (similar approach with a different kind of quantized wave packets\nwas quite recently used for predicting of a decoherence effect of an entangled pair with one of the qubits perceiving\nchanges in the gravitational field [15]). How could a communication with Minkowski particle look like? This is in fact\nthe question of the information encoding, i.e. defining a logical qubit communication basis. As we will see, the choice\nof the encoding has an impact on the calculation using the field transformation from Minkowski to Rindler spacetime.\nLet the Minkowski observers' basis be composed of two one-Minkowski particles both in two orthogonal spatial\nmodes (here indexed as 1,2). This is known as the dual rail encoding used, for example, in linear-optical quantum\ncomputing schemes [16] or an experimental realization of quantum teleportation protocol [17]. Then, we can write\nour logical qubits as\nM\n\nM\n\nM\n\nM\n\n{|Oi \u2261 |0i1 |1i2 , |11i \u2261 |1i1 |0i2 },\n\n(1)\n\nwhere |0i, |1i is the Minkowski vacuum and the Minkowski one-particle, respectively. Similarly as for the quantization\nof Fock states the field is quantized in both Minkowski and Rindler spacetime and the corresponding creation and\nannihilation operators (before the quantization being the mode expansion coefficients) are defined. Using the KleinGordon inner product these two sets of operators are related and the creation and annihilation operators from one\nspace are expressed as linear combinations of those from the other space. The coefficients in these combinations are\nknown as the Bogoliubov particle coefficients yielding [12] the transformed Minkowski vacuum (the Rindler vacuum)\nM\n\n|0i1 =\n\nY\nk,l\n\n\u221e\nX\n1\ntanhg rk |g\u2212k,l i1L |gk,l i1R ,\ncosh rk g=0\n\n(2)\n\n\u0001\u22121/2\nwhere cosh rk = 1 \u2212 e\u22122\u03c0\u03c9k c/a\n, tanh rk = e\u2212\u03c0\u03c9k c/a with a the Rindler observer's proper acceleration and e.g.\n|gk,l i1R is the Rindler g\u2212particle state with integer mode numbers k, l characterizing the particle in Rindler spacetime\nin spatial mode 1 and the right wedge. The Minkowski one-particle state as seen by the Rindler observer has the\nform [12]\nM\n1k\u0303l\u0303 1\n\n=\n\nh Y\n\nk6=kt\nl6=lt\n\n\u221e\n\u221e\ni\nX\nX\np\n1\n1\np\n1 + q tanhq rkt |(1 + q)\u2212kt ,lt i1L |qkt ,lt i1R ,\ntanh rk |p\u2212k,l i1L |pk,l i1R \u00d7\n2\ncosh rk p=0\ncosh rkt q=0\n\n(3)\nwhere the indexes with tildes indicate the particles in Minkowski space and kt , lt are so called equivalent modes in\nRindler spacetime [12] corresponding to the indexes k\u0303 l\u0303. As usual, the Rindler observer has access just to one of the\nwedges (in our case to the right one). Generally, we can see the glimpse of similarity to the transformation of ordinary\nFock states.\nLet us see how a density matrix in the dual-rail representation transforms as a whole. Taking the corresponding\nproducts of Eqs. (3) and (2) and tracing over the left wedge the matrix elements acquire the form of infinite-dimensional\nmatrices. First, for the diagonal elements we have\nTrL [|OihO|] =\n\nY\nk,l\n\n\u00d7\n\n\u221e\nX\n1\ntanh2g rk |gk,l ihgk,l |1\ncosh2 rk g=0\n\nY\n\nk6=kt\nl6=lt\n\n\u221e\n\u221e\nX\nX\n1\n1\n2p\n(1 + q) tanh2q rkt |qkt ,lt ihqkt ,lt |2 ,\ntanh\nr\n|p\nihp\n|\n\u00d7\nk k,l\nk,l 2\ncosh2 rk p=0\ncosh4 rkt q=0\n\n(4)\n\nand similarly for TrL [|11ih11|]. We see that both matrices are diagonal due to the orthogonality relations valid for k, l\n\n\f3\nand the spatial modes. After tracing over the left wedge of the transformed off-diagonal matrix elements we get\nTrL [|Oih11|] =\n\nY\n\n\u221e\n\u221e\nX\nX\np\n1\n1\n2p\n1 + q tanh2q rkt |(1 + q)kt ,lt ihqkt ,lt |1\ntanh\nr\n|p\nihp\n|\n\u00d7\nk k,l\nk,l 1\n2\n3\ncosh rk p=0\ncosh rkt q=0\n\nY\n\n\u221e\n\u221e\nX\nX\np\n1\n1\n2f\n1 + g tanh2g rkt |gkt ,lt ih(1 + g)kt ,lt |2\ntanh\nr\n|f\nihf\n|\n\u00d7\nk k,l\nk,l 2\n2\n3\ncosh rk f =0\ncosh rkt g=0\n\nk6=kt\nl6=lt\n\n\u00d7\n\nk6=kt\nl6=lt\n\nT\n\n= (TrL [|11ihO|]) .\n\n(5)\n\nThus, both off-diagonal elements from Minkowski spacetime become off-diagonal matrices in Rindler spacetime and\na general Minkowski density matrix (in the dual-rail representation) is symmetrical and three-diagonal after the\ntransformation.\nII.\n\nPERFECT AND PARTIAL QUANTUM STATE ENCRYPTION\n\nHaving introduced the concept of localized objects both in Minkowski and Rindler spacetime we can start generalizing PQC into the relativistic setting. Let Alice and Bob be two inertial observers in Minkowski spacetime who\nshare a random and private string of bits \u2013 key and are connected through a quantum channel. The bits of the key\nindex unitary operations (to be specified) are defined in a space spanned by the dual rail basis vectors (1). Hence,\nAlice receives/prepares an arbitrary and unknown quantum state (generally a mixed state written in the dual rail\nbasis (1)) and applies one of the unitaries dictated by the key. She sends the modified state down the channel to Bob\nwho makes the inverse unitary operation. The task for Alice and Bob is to securely transmit the input (unencrypted)\nstate and to prevent from a potential eavesdropping by Eve. She has full access to the quantum channel and is able to\nconstruct any generalized measurement (POVM) that could give her some information about the state. In our case,\nwe suppose that Eve is a non-inertial observer so let us investigate the consequences for the protocol security.\nThe theory of PQCs learns [8] that for any qubit \u039e holds\n4\n\n\u039e 7\u2192\n\n11\n1X\n\u03c3i \u039e\u03c3i\u2020 = = \u033a,\n4 i=1\n2\n\n(6)\n\nwhere the encryption set composed of the Pauli matrices {\u03c3i } \u21cb {11, \u03c3X , \u03c3Y , \u03c3Z } is the usual (but non-unique) choice\nfor the encryption procedure. No matter the form of \u039e someone without the knowledge which operation for the\nencryption \u03c3i was used has no chance to get any information about the state since in the identity density matrix\nthere is no information on the input state. This is called a perfect encryption. We also see that necessary (and also\nsufficient [8]) length of the shared key for the encryption of one qubit are two bits. On the other hand, if we don't\nadhere to the rule of not using less than a two-bit key and use, for instance \u03c31 , \u03c32 , i.e. just a one-bit key, we get a\npartially encrypted qubit\n2\n\n\u039e 7\u2192\n\n1X\n1\n\u03c3j \u039e\u03c3j\u2020 =\n2 j=1\n2\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n1\nf (\u039e12 , \u039e21 )\n= \u033a \u0303.\nf (\u039e12 , \u039e21 )\n1\n\n(7)\n\nHence, in the off-diagonal terms of \u033a \u0303 there is some hidden information about \u039e and the state is not secured. So,\nassuming the partial encryption a possible inertial eavesdropper would apparently have a chance to get some information on the input state. But how is it with Eve as the non-inertial eavesdropper? Before answering this question\nlet us make a small detour and say something general about the PQC applicability.\nObviously, PQC is meaningful whenever an eavesdropper can get some information about density matrix elements by\nany kind of generalized measurement. Into this situation falls (a) the case when we have several copies of an unknown\nstate (or generally classically correlated input and thusPwe can make a quantum state estimation) or (b) the case\nwhen we have one copy of an arbitrary mixed state \u039e = pi \u039ei with given a priori probabilities pi and we implement\none of possible discrimination techniques such as unambiguous state discrimination (if applicable), minimum error\ndiscrimination or their advanced combinations [18]. On the contrary, if one has one copy of an unknown or even\nknown state then the encryption is unnecessary. In the first case the state is already encrypted (an unknown qubit is\nseen as a mixture of all states in the Bloch Sphere that is proportional to a maximally mixed state) and in the latter\ncase one just needs to send classical information about the state preparation and a high-priced quantum channel is not\n\n\f4\nrequired for the state transmission (the question of information load tradeoff between classical and quantum channel\nis not interesting for us now).\nFor later purposes, let us shortly discuss how the leakage of information of an encrypted state can be measured. The\nextractable information is quantified by the accessible information which is a maximization over all possible POVMs.\nHowever, finding the optimal POVM is a rather difficult task and analytical solutions are known only for few cases,\nmostly under some kind of symmetry [10]. In this light, the quantity we will use is the Holevo information [11]\n\u03c7({pi , \u033ai }) = S(\u033a) \u2212\n\nn\nX\n\npi S(\u033ai )\n\n(8)\n\ni=1\n\nP\nbounding the accessible information from above, where \u033a =\npi \u033ai and S(\u033a) = \u2212 Tr [\u033a log2 \u033a] is the von Neumann\nentropy. The Holevo bound is more feasible to calculate than the accessible information but it is not generally a tight\nbound. Fortunately, in the case we are investigating it is so. To see it, let us assume that an input qubit is fully\nencrypted\n\u039e=\n\nn\nX\n\nP QC\n\npi \u039ei 7\u2212\u2192\n\nn\nX\n\n4\n\npi\n\ni=1\n\ni=1\n\n1X\n\u03c3j \u039ei \u03c3j\u2020 = \u033a (\u221d 11).\n4 j\n|\n{z\n}\n\u033ai \u221d 11\n\n(9)\n\nThen, for the best possible discrimination of the states before encryption (\u039ei ) Eve has to distinguish among \u033ai because\nthe non-encrypted states were transformed onto this 'encoding'. Inserting the encoding into (8) we get \u03c7({pi , \u033ai }) = 0.\nOf course, after the encryption Eve may attempt to distinguish any encoding at her will (and the Holevo bound does\nnot need to be zero) but whatever discrimination strategy she chooses at the end of the day she always gets zero\ninformation about the occurrence of the states \u039ei before the encryption [8].\nIII.\n\nINFORMATION GAIN OF AN ACCELERATED EAVESDROPPER\n\nThe purpose of this main part is to show that in the limit of infinite acceleration an eavesdropper (Eve as the\nRindler observer) cannot get any information from just a partially encrypted qubit. First, we show that in the infinite\nlimit the Holevo bound for a perfectly encrypted qubit is the same as a partially encrypted one. Second, despite the\nHolevo bound not being a tight upper bound for the accessible information we show that the accessible information\navailable to the accelerated eavesdropper tapping a partially encrypted qubit is zero as well. We may write\n\n|\u03c7({pi , \u033ai }) \u2212 \u03c7({p\u0303i , \u033a \u0303i })| = S(\u033a) \u2212 S( \u0303\n\u033a) +\n\nn\nX\n\n\u2264 |S( \u0303\n\u033a) \u2212 S(\u033a)| +\n\np\u0303i S( \u0303\n\u033ai ) \u2212\n\ni=1\nn\nX\n\nn\nX\n\npi S(\u033ai )\n\ni=1\nn\nX\n\np\u0303i S( \u0303\n\u033ai ) \u2212\n\npi S(\u033ai )\n\nby the triangle inequality.\n\n(10)\n\ni=1\n\ni=1\n\nNext, in the spirit of Eq. (9) we use S(\u033ai ) = S(\u033a) and prove the convergence of the second summand in the second\nrow of Eq. (10). Later, using the same equality, we show that the convergence of the first summand follows from a\nsimple modification of the proof of the convergence of the second summand. It is a special case simply by putting\nn = 1 (p\u0303i = 1), i.e. omitting the sum over n in all the derivations which follow.\nHence, rewriting the second summand in Eq. (10) and generating its Taylor series about any (identical) nonzero\npoint we get after the rearranging [20]\n!\n!!\n!\n\u221e\nn\n\u221e\n\u221e\nn\nn\n\u221e\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\n\u0002 k\u0003\n\u0002 k\u0003\nk\nk\n, (11)\np\u0303i Tr \u033a \u0303i \u2212 Tr \u033a\n=\nbk\np\u0303i \u03bb\u0303ij \u2212 \u03bbj\nbk\np\u0303i \u03bb\u0303ij log2 \u03bb\u0303ij \u2212 \u03bbj log2 \u03bbj =\nj=1\n\ni=1\n\nj=1\n\nk=0\n\ni=1\n\nk=0\n\ni=1\n\n\u0002 \u0003\n\u0002 \u0003 P\u221e\nP\u221e\nwhere \u03bb\u0303ij , \u03bbj is the j\u2212th eigenvalue of \u033a \u0303i and \u033a, respectively, and j=1 \u03bb\u0303kij = Tr \u033a \u0303ki , j=1 \u03bbkj = Tr \u033ak was used.\nbk are the Taylor expansion coefficients and are set up to be identical for all expanded functions inPour case [20].\nEq. (11) is trivially equal to zero if k = 0, the same holds for k = 1 ( \u0303\n\u033ai , \u033a are density matrices and\np\u0303i = 1). For\n\n\f5\nk = 2 we will show its asymptotic convergence to zero in Rindler space by a direct calculation. This will be a starting\npoint for proving the convergence for k > 2. First, we set up the following notation\naq =\n\ntanh2q r\n(1 + q)\ncosh4 r\n\nAq =\n\ntanh2q r p\n1+q\ncosh3 r\n\n(12)\n\n(r \u2208 R+ ) where aq are the elements of Eq. (4) forming the diagonal of Eqs. (6) and (7) in Rindler spacetime. Similarly,\nthe coefficients Aq coming from Eq. (5) are the off-diagonal elements\nof Eq. (7) in Rindler spacetime. The off-diagonal\nP\ncoefficients of the matrices \u033a \u0303i (coming from Eq. (7) for \u039e = pi \u039ei ) are the scalar functions fi (\u039e12 , \u039e21 ) independent\nof the acceleration and do not transform. Also, note that P\nwe work just with one mode k, l [21]. Next, for the upcoming\n\u221e\nconsiderations we need to know that aq > aq+1 , limr\u2192\u221e q=0 a2q = 0, 0 \u2264 aq \u2264 1 and the same holds for Aq . Writing\nthe square of\nP\u033a \u0303i we get\nP a five-diagonal\nP infinite-dimensional matrix where on the diagonals we generally find sequences\nof the type\naq ap , Aq Ap and\naq Ap [22]. Due to the properties of aq , Aq all of them can be bounded from above\nby putting p = q thus the sequences (and of course their elements) converge to zero for r \u2192 \u221e.\nTo continue let us consider the following inequalities\n\uf8ee\n!k \uf8f9\nn\nn\nn\nX\nX\n\u0003\n\u0002\n\u0002 k\u0003\n\u0002 k\u0003\n\u0002 k\u0003 X\n\u0002 k\u0003\n(13)\n\u033a \u0303i + \u033a \uf8fb \u2264 Tr (n + 1)k \u033a \u0303kmax ,\nTr \u033a \u0303i \u2212 Tr \u033a \u2264 Tr \uf8f0\np\u0303i Tr \u033a \u0303i \u2212 Tr \u033a \u2264\ni=1\n\ni=1\n\ni=1\n\nwhere, as stated, all \u033a \u0303i have the same form as Eq. (7) but with different scalar functions fi (\u039e12 , \u039e21 ). Thus, the\nmaximum is taken over n scalar functions. The last inequality in Eq. (13) does not hold in general but the structure\nof \u033a \u0303i , \u033a allows us to do it (recall that we are in Rindler spacetime where \u033a is a diagonal density matrix and \u033a \u0303i are\nthree-diagonal density matrices with the main diagonal equal to the diagonal of \u033a). Then\n!\n\u0014\u0010\nn\n\u0011k\u2032 \u0015\nh\nX\n\u0001k/2 i\n\u0002 k\u0003\n\u0002 k\u0003\n2\n2\n,\n(14)\n= m Tr\nlim \u033a \u0303max\n\u2264 lim Tr m \u0303\n\u033amax\nTr \u033a \u0303i \u2212 Tr \u033a\nlim\nr\u2192\u221e\n\nr\u2192\u221e\n\ni=1\n\nr\u2192\u221e\n\nwhere m = (n + 1)2 , k \u2032 = k/2 (note that for the convergence of the first summand in Eq. (10) we have m = 1 and\nthus there is no need for the maximization over n). We use some basic limit properties in the last equality with\nlimr\u2192\u221e \u033a \u03032max meaning the limit of every element of the matrix \u033a \u03032max . Since for r \u2192 \u221e the limit converges to zero its\nk \u2032 \u2212th matrix power converge as well thus proving the convergence of Eq. (11) to zero. Consequently, we bounded the\nHolevo information difference (10) from above.\nSince the Holevo bound is not a tight bound on the accessible information it remains one step more and we follow\nup with the discussion from the end of Sec. II. From Eq. (10) we know that the difference goes asymptotically to zero.\nNow we choose the encoding {pi , \u033ai } of the perfect PQC such that \u03c7({pi , \u033ai }) = 0 both in Minkowski and Rindler\nspacetime. In fact it corresponds to Eve's choice of the discrimination strategy in Rindler spacetime. Although we\ncannot dictate Eve what to do, in this case, due to the properties of perfect PQC, any tapping strategy she is able\nto do gives her no information. Then, from the convergence above together with Eq. (10) it follows that the Rindler\nobserver (Eve) cannot get any information even from the partially encrypted quantum state.\nIV.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nWa addressed the question of the role of the Unruh effect on security of quantum communication. We considered the\nsetting where two honest parties are at rest (Minkowski observers) and an eavesdropper is uniformly accelerated with\nrespect to them (Rindler observer). The Minkowski observers established PQC where logical qubits are represented\nby a free scalar field in the form of so-called Minkowski particles considering the dual-rail encoding. The legal parties\ndid not satisfy the security requirements and they encrypted a qubit with just one bit of a classical key instead of two\nbits. Since this is a necessary and sufficient condition for the perfect encryption, it would generally lead to a leakage\nof some information about the qubit. However, we have shown that in the limit of infinite acceleration this partial\nencryption is sufficient to secure the qubit and, thus, it is prevented form getting any information into the hands of\nan eavesdropper.\nIn other words, we have shown that the Unruh effect makes the communication noisy in the direction where the\neavesdropper in an non-inertial frame cannot distinguish between a perfectly and partially encrypted qubit. The\nimportant aspect of the above conclusion is that we did not consider problematic single photon excitations (Fock\nstates) but temporarily and spatially localized objects both in Minkowski and Rindler spacetime (Minkowski and\nRindler particles, respectively). The problem of Fock states lies in their delocalization making difficult to talk about\n\n\f6\nthe preparation or manipulation (considering the production of Fock states in a realistic cavity which is subsequently\naccelerated brings even more problems). This is the first step toward the description of a more natural and general\nsetup where both the legal participants and Eve are differently accelerated and the objective would be to enumerate\nthe leaked information not only in the asymptotic case.\nAcknowledgments\n\nThe author is very grateful for valuable discussions with R.
