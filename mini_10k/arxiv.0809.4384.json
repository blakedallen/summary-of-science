Introduction\nTopological defects are of considerable interest in many areas of theoretical and mathematical physics, and find application in topics as diverse as superconductivity, nuclear physics\nand cosmology, as well as having interesting mathematical properties in their own right.\nWhilst most of these fields are concerned with the study of topological defects in nondynamical and often flat spacetimes, within the field of cosmology it becomes important\nto examine the effect of gravity on the properties and behaviour of these objects.\nWhen studying topological defects, one is often interested in finding the static configurations that minimise the total energy within each topologically distinct class of boundary\nconditions. Such configurations are the stable, classical ground states of the theory, and\nalso form a convenient basis for numerical and analytical studies of low energy defect\ndynamics.\nIn Minkowski space, or other non-dynamical, highly symmetrical spacetimes, there is\nan established method, attributed to Bogomol'nyi, for finding such minimum-energy field\nconfigurations in many models that admit solitonic solutions (for a review, see [1]). It\ninvolves making use of a clever rearrangement of the energy-momentum tensor to write the\ntotal energy as\nZ\nE=\n\nd3 xT 00 = |Q| + P ,\n\n(1.1)\n\nwhere Q is a topologically conserved charge, related to the asymptotic boundary conditions,\nand P is a manifestly non-negative spatial volume integral. This leads to the following lower\nbound on the energy of defects\nE \u2265 |Q| ,\n(1.2)\n\n\u20131\u2013\n\n\fwhich is called a Bogomol'nyi bound. The energy is minimised when P is zero, and by\nfinding the conditions under which P vanishes, we obtain a set of field equations, called\nBogomol'nyi equations, that characterise the minimum-energy field configurations.\nHowever, for gravitational field theories, such energy bounds have been harder to\ncome by, due to the difficulty in finding a suitable expression for the total energy, and the\nmore complicated form of the energy-momentum tensor for a general metric. One way\nforward is to reduce the number of degrees of freedom in the metric by imposing certain\nexact symmetries on the spacetime [2]. When working within a well-chosen class of highly\nsymmetric metrics, the expressions for the total energy and the energy-momentum tensor\nbecome very similar to their counterparts from the corresponding non-gravitational theory,\nand therefore we can perform a similar rearrangement to minimise the energy.\nThis approach is widely used [3, 4, 5], and the energy bounds and first-order equations\nthat are derived in this manner are usually called Bogomol'nyi bounds and equations. The\nbeauty of this method is that it is a natural extension of the familiar non-gravitational\nBogomol'nyi method \u2013 in fact, a gravitational bound of this sort follows wherever a similar\nbound exists for the corresponding non-gravitational theory. This result, which suggests\nthat Bogomol'nyi bounds generally survive coupling to gravity [6], means that there is an\nimplicit assumption in much of the literature on gravitational topological defects that a nongravitational Bogomol'nyi bound is enough to establish the stability of bound-saturating\nsolutions even after gravity is taken into account [7, 8].\nHowever, as the assumption of symmetry is made prior to minimising the energy, we\ncannot in fact preclude the possibility that the energy bounds provided by this method\nmay be saturated, or even violated, by defects that do not possess the assumed symmetries.\nIntuitively speaking, we do not expect such bound-violating solutions to exist \u2013 we would\nbe surprised to find that non-gravitational Bogomol'nyi bounds do not survive coupling\nto gravity. Nevertheless, without a more rigorous derivation of Bogomol'nyi bounds for\ngravitational theories, the stability of the widely-studied defect solutions that saturate\nthese bounds is called into question.\nFurthermore, it is often the case in non-gravitational theories that there exist multidefect solutions that saturate the Bogomol'nyi bounds, at least for some region of the\nparameter space. Again, it seems reasonable to consider whether such solutions survive\nthe coupling to gravity \u2013 however, unless one can guess a sufficiently accurate ansatz for the\nmetric beforehand, the Bogomol'nyi technique of [2] cannot help us answer this question.\nFor these reasons, it would be worthwhile to pursue an alternative method for finding\nminimum-energy solutions in gravitational field theories that does not depend on making\nprior assumptions of symmetry. The pursuit of such a method would involve tackling the\nproblems mentioned above \u2013 that of finding an appropriate expression for the energy, and\nthat of rearranging this expression in the presence of a large number of degrees of freedom\nin the metric \u2013 head on.\nThe reader may have already noticed a striking resemblance between the problem\ndescribed here and the positive energy theorem in general relativity. In fact, Witten's proof\nof the positive energy theorem [9], with its use of a spinorial expression for the total energy,\nhas already proved rather useful in establishing Bogomol'nyi bounds for certain theories.\n\n\u20132\u2013\n\n\fUsing techniques derived from this proof, full Bogomol'nyi bounds have been constructed\nfor certain three-dimensional [10] and four-dimensional [11] supergravity models with Dterm symmetry breaking.\nIn this paper, we extend these results and demonstrate how, using techniques from\nthe positive energy theorem, we may derive Bogomol'nyi bounds for any gravitational\nfield theory wherever a similar bound exists for its non-gravitational counterpart. Due to\nthe cosmological motivation for this study, we only consider cosmic strings from now on.\nHowever, we expect the methods presented here to be applicable, following appropriate\nmodifications, to defects of other dimensionalities, such as domain walls and monopoles.\nThe rest of this paper is organised as follows. In Section 2 we describe the asymptotic\nstructure of a spacetime containing a long cosmic string, and consider how to express the\ntotal energy of such a spacetime. We use this expression in Section 3 to find a Bogomol'nyi\nbound for the gravitational version of the abelian-Higgs model and subsequently examine how this model forms the basis for finding Bogomol'nyi bounds for many other field\ntheories. Then in Section 4, we compare our gravitational Bogomol'nyi procedure to the\ntraditional non-gravitational Bogomol'nyi procedure, and show that the former is really\na generalisation of the latter. In this way we confirm that non-gravitational Bogomol'nyi\nbounds, and the single-vortex solutions that saturate them, do survive coupling to gravity.\nWe conclude in Section 5.\n\n2. Cosmic string spacetimes\nIf we are to minimise the total energy of a spacetime without relying on working within\na class of highly symmetric metrics, then we must first identify a suitable expression for\nthe total energy. In general relativity, the notion of total energy is closely tied up with the\nasymptotic structure of the spacetime under consideration. This is because the energy is a\nglobal quantity, dependent on the behaviour of the fields at every point on some hypersurface that stretches to infinity. Therefore, without being able to effectively compactify the\nspacetime, by specifying an appropriate asymptotic structure, we cannot hope to calculate\nthe total energy of a system.\nWhere we have a compact source, the usual definitions of the energy (such as the\nADM energy) stem from the canonical notion of an asymptotically flat spacetime [12].\nSuch a spacetime can be compactified, with a single point representing spatial infinity, and\nthe spacetime becomes asymptotically flat in every direction. However, it is clear that\nthis standard notion of asymptotic flatness is not appropriate for describing a long cosmic\nstring \u2013 essentially because there is now an axial direction (running parallel to the string)\nalong which fields do not fall to zero and we do not reach asymptotic flatness.\nTo resolve this problem, we must modify our notion of asymptotic flatness for a cosmic\nstring spacetime, by distinguishing between radial infinity (where we do have asymptotic\nflatness) and the asymptotic behaviour in the axial direction, on which we have to impose\nsuitable conditions in order to have a well-defined energy. We shall accomplish this by\ncompactifying one spatial dimension on a circle of circumference Lz and wrapping the\n\n\u20133\u2013\n\n\fcosmic string around this circle. In the limit Lz \u2192 \u221e, edge effects should vanish, and the\nresults we obtain should reasonably represent the properties of an infinitely long string.\nHaving thus described the asymptotic structure of a cosmic string spacetime, we note\nthat, due to asymptotic flatness, there exists a neighbourhood of radial infinity, the asymptotic region, in which we can find asymptotic cylindrical coordinates, (t, r, \u03b8, z) for r greater\nthan some constant r0 , in which the metric tends to the following limit as r \u2192 \u221e:\nds2 = dt2 \u2212 dr 2 \u2212 (1 \u2212 \u03b4/2\u03c0)2 r 2 d\u03b8 2 \u2212 dz 2 ,\n\n(2.1)\n\nwhere \u03b4 is the conical deficit angle. These coordinates shall turn out to be useful later on,\nwhen we examine the behaviour of fields near radial infinity. In order to fix the deficit angle\n\u03b4, we recall that the solutions we are interested in should asymptotically tend to the static,\ncylindrically symmetric bound-saturating solutions that have already been found using the\ntraditional Bogomol'nyi method of [2] (as these are the solutions that are relevant to a\ndiscussion about the stability of static, cylindrically symmetric solutions). For the static\ncylindrically symmetric solutions, one finds that \u03b4 = 2\u03c0|Q|, where Q is the topological\ncharge of the string. Therefore, we fix \u03b4 in a similar manner here.\nWe now turn to the question of how to define the total energy of a cosmic string spacetime. In a canonical asymptotically flat spacetime, the ADM energy is defined with respect\nto some maximal spacelike hypersurface S (i.e. a spacelike hypersurface that extends to\nspatial infinity) in terms of a surface integral over the asymptotic boundary of S, \u2202S, at\nspatial infinity. Given such an integral expression for the ADM energy, it seems reasonable to speculate that the energy of a cosmic string spacetime can be given by a similar\nexpression, with the only difference being that we replace spatial infinity by radial infinity,\nresulting in \u2202S having the topology of a torus, rather than a sphere. If this is the case\n(as is confirmed in Appendix A), then in order to find an expression for the energy of a\ncosmic string spacetime that satisfies the requirements set out in the Introduction, we only\nneed find an appropriate expression for the ADM energy satisfying the same conditions:\nwe expect this expression to carry over to the cosmic string spacetime following a simple\nchange of the asymptotic surface of integration.\nAll that now remains is to identify a suitable expression for the ADM energy \u2013 one\nthat, as described in the Introduction, is likely to admit a Bogomol'nyi rearrangement for\na fully general metric. In particular, it would be ideal if the energy expression had a clear\nconnection to the Minkowski spacetime expression for the total energy, in terms of a volume\nintegral over the energy-momentum tensor.\nSuch an energy expression has been provided by Nester [13] during his proof of the\npositive energy theorem:1\nZ\n1\ndS\u03bc\u03bd E \u03bc\u03bd ,\n(2.2)\np\u03bc u\u221e\n=\n\u03bc\n2 \u2202S\nwhere\nE \u03bc\u03bd = i\u03b5\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1\u03c3 \u03b7\u0304\u03b35 \u03b3\u03c1 \u2207\u03c3 \u03b7 \u2212 \u2207\u03c3 \u03b7\u03b35 \u03b3\u03c1 \u03b7\n1\n\nThroughout this paper we work in natural units, with 8\u03c0G = 1.\n\n\u20134\u2013\n\n\u0001\n\n(2.3)\n\n\fis the Witten-Nester 2-form.2 The parameter \u03b7 is an arbitrary Dirac spinor field that is\nasymptotically Killing (\u2207\u03bc \u03b7 \u2192 0), and u\u03bc = \u03b7\u0304\u03b3 \u03bc \u03b7 is hence an asymptotically constant,\ntimelike vector field. The asymptotic 4-vector u\u221e\u03bc is the limit of u\u03bc at spatial infinity, and\nrepresents the 4-velocity of the observer at spatial infinity who is measuring the energy of\nthe system.\nHaving converted this expression into a volume integral with the aid of the divergence\ntheorem, we apply the identity\n1 \u03c1\u03c3\n\u2207[\u03bc \u2207\u03bd] \u03b7 = \u2212 R \u03bc\u03bd \u03b3\u03c1\u03c3 \u03b7 ,\n8\nand Einstein's equation to find that\nZ\nn\no\n\u03bc \u221e\np u\u03bc = dS\u03bc T \u03bc\u03bd u\u03bd \u2212 2\u2207\u03bd \u03b7\u03b3 \u03bd\u03bc\u03c1 \u2207\u03c1 \u03b7 .\n\n(2.4)\n\n(2.5)\n\nS\n\nThis integral is very similar to the Minkowski spacetime expression for the energy. In\nfact, in a static spacetime, with S normal to the timelike and Killing t-direction, we can\nchoose \u03b7 to be an exact Killing spinor such that u\u03bc = (1, 0, 0, 0) everywhere, and the above\nexpression reduces to\nZ\np0 =\n\nS\n\ndV T 00 ,\n\n(2.6)\n\nwhich is exactly the Minkowski spacetime expression for the energy \u2013 the very expression that is rearranged during the non-gravitational Bogomol'nyi procedure. This is an\nencouraging sign that we may be able to rearrange the Witten-Nester energy expression,\nin an analogous manner to the non-gravitational rearrangement of (2.6), in order to find\nBogomol'nyi bounds in the presence of gravity.\n\n3. Bogomol'nyi bounds for gravitational field theories\nWe shall now examine how the Witten-Nester energy expression may be used to find\nBogomol'nyi bounds for gravitational field theories in cosmic string spacetimes.\nUpon transferring the Witten-Nester energy expression to a cosmic string spacetime,\nwe immediately encounter a hitch: there are no globally well-defined asymptotically Killing\nspinors in a cosmic string spacetime with non-zero deficit angle. This can be seen quite\nsimply by noting that the \u03b8 component of the Killing spinor equation is asymptotically\n1\n\u2202\u03b8 \u03b7 \u2212 C \u2032 \u03b312 \u03b7 = 0 ,\n2\n\n(3.1)\n\nwhere C \u2032 = 1 \u2212 \u03b4/2\u03c0. This has the general solution\n\u03b7 = \u03b7+ e\n\niC \u2032 \u03b8\n2\n\n+ \u03b7\u2212 e\n\n\u2212iC \u2032 \u03b8\n2\n\n,\n\n(3.2)\n\nwhere \u03b7\u00b1 are coordinate-constant spinors satisfying the projection conditions\n(1 \u00b1 i\u03b312 )\u03b7\u00b1 = 0 .\n2\n\n(3.3)\n\u03bd\u03c1\n\nThe spinor covariant derivative is given by \u2207\u03bc \u03b7 = \u2202\u03bc \u03b7 + 41 \u03c9\u03bc \u03b3\u03bd\u03c1 \u03b7, where \u03b3\u03bc\u03bd = \u03b3[\u03bc \u03b3\u03bd] . Underlined\nindices are used to represent frame (tetrad) components.\n\n\u20135\u2013\n\n\fTherefore, even if we set either \u03b7+ or \u03b7\u2212 to zero, we can only obtain a globally well-defined\nspinor \u03b7 if C \u2032 = 1 (and hence \u03b4 = 0).\nIn order to circumvent this problem, let us now suppose that it is possible to find some\ncurrent, J\u03bc , constructed from the matter fields, such that\nZ\nJ\u03bc dx\u03bc = 2\u03c0Q ,\n(3.4)\nS\u221e\n\nwhere Q is the topological charge of the cosmic string and S\u221e is any closed curve at radial\ninfinity that encircles the cosmic string once. Using this current we can define a modified\n\u02c6 \u03bc by including an extra connection term as follows:\ncovariant spinor derivative \u2207\n\u02c6 \u03bc \u03b7 = \u2207\u03bc \u03b7 + i J \u03bc \u03b7 .\n\u2207\n2\n\n(3.5)\n\nWe may now consider whether there exist any spinors that asymptotically satisfy the\n\u02c6 \u03bc \u03b7 = 0. In fact, we can solve this equation asymptotically\nmodified Killing spinor equation \u2207\nin a similar manner to before, and now find the general asymptotic solution\n\u03b7 = \u03b7+ e\n\ni(C \u2032 \u2212Q)\u03b8\n2\n\n+ \u03b7\u2212 e\n\n\u2212i(C \u2032 +Q)\u03b8\n2\n\n.\n\n(3.6)\n\nThis solution is globally well-defined, provided that \u03b7sign(Q) = 0.\nWe shall see that, for many models admitting solitonic string solutions, a current J\u03bc ,\nsatisfying condition (3.4) does exist. For such models, we can therefore find asymptotically\nmodified-Killing spinors, which satisfy the asymptotic projection condition\n(1 + i\u03ba\u03b312 )\u03b7 \u2192 0 ,\n\n(3.7)\n\nwhere \u03ba = sign(Q). We also note that this asymptotic projection condition implies that,\ngiven an asymptotically modified-Killing spinor \u03b7, we can always find an asymptotic cylindrical coordinate system in which the two asymptotically constant (and Killing) vectors\nu\u03bc = \u03b7\u0304\u03b3\u03bc \u03b7 and v \u03bc = \u03b7\u0304\u03b35 \u03b3\u03bc \u03b7 have the following limits as r \u2192 \u221e:\n\u03bc\nu\u221e\n\u03bc dx = dt ,\n\n\u03bc\nv\u221e\n\u03bc dx = \u03badz .\n\n(3.8)\n\nBefore proceeding, we ought to eliminate a potential source for confusion. In super\u02c6 \u03bc is often used to denote a particular choice of modified\ngravity theories, the notation \u2207\nspinor derivative \u2013 essentially one where the current J\u03bc of our notation is identified with\nthe gravitino U (1) connection AB\n\u03bc . Although, as we shall see later on, such a choice allows\nus to define modified-Killing spinors for certain models, there are other models in which\nthe holonomy of AB\n\u03bc no longer leads to the cancellation in (3.6) that is required for the existence of modified-Killing spinors. Furthermore, we would like our Bogomol'nyi procedure\nto be just as applicable as its non-gravitational counterpart, which can be applied to a\nmodel without regard to any supersymmetric extension the model may or may not admit.\nFor these reasons, we choose to define the modified spinor derivative more generally, so\nthat we can make a more judicious choice of connection that allows for the existence of\nasymptotically modified-Killing spinors.\n\n\u20136\u2013\n\n\f\u00ca \u03bc\u03bd\n\nUsing this modified spinor derivative, we may define a modified Witten-Nester 2-form\nin the following manner:\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u02c6 \u03c3\u03b7 \u2212 \u2207\n\u02c6 \u03c3 \u03b7\u03b35 \u03b3\u03c1 \u03b7 .\n\u00ca \u03bc\u03bd = i\u03b5\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1\u03c3 \u03b7\u0304\u03b35 \u03b3\u03c1 \u2207\n(3.9)\n\nIntegrating \u00ca \u03bc\u03bd over \u2202S, we find that the inclusion of the J\u03bc connection gives\nZ\nZ\n1\n1\n\u03bc\u03bd\ndS\u03bc\u03bd \u00ca =\ndS\u03bc\u03bd E \u03bc\u03bd \u2212 2\u03c0\u03baQLz ,\n2 \u2202S\n2 \u2202S\n\n(3.10)\n\nwhere E \u03bc\u03bd is the original Witten-Nester 2-form, defined as in (2.3).\nAs argued in Appendix A, the integral of E \u03bc\u03bd gives the energy of the cosmic string\nspacetime. Therefore, dividing (3.10) by Lz , we find that the energy per unit length, \u03bc,\nsatisfies\nZ\n1\ndS\u03bc\u03bd \u00ca \u03bc\u03bd .\n(3.11)\n\u03bc = 2\u03c0|Q| +\n2Lz \u2202S\nHence we can establish the Bogomol'nyi bound\n\u03bc \u2265 2\u03c0|Q| ,\n\n(3.12)\n\nif we can demonstrate that the integral of \u00ca \u03bc\u03bd in (3.11) is non-negative. To this end, we\nrepeat the manipulations that took us from the surface integral (2.2) to the volume integral\n(2.5), and find that\nZ\nZ\nn\no\n1\n\u02c6 \u03bd \u03b7\u03b3 \u03bd\u03bc\u03c1 \u2207\n\u02c6 \u03c1\u03b7 .\ndS\u03bc\u03bd \u00ca \u03bc\u03bd = dS\u03bc T \u03bc\u03bd u\u03bd \u2212 \u01eb\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1\u03c3 \u2202\u03bd J\u03c1 v\u03c3 + 2\u2207\n(3.13)\n2 \u2202S\nS\nIf we choose the S to be normal to the 0-direction, this becomes\nZ\nZ\nn\n\u0001\n\u0001o\n1\n\u03bc\u03bd\n\u02c6 i \u03b7\u2020 \u2207\n\u02c6 j \u03b7 \u2212 2 \u03b3i\u2207\n\u02c6 i\u03b7 \u2020 \u03b3j \u2207\n\u02c6 j \u03b7 . (3.14)\ndS\u03bc\u03bd \u00ca = dS0 T 0\u03bd u\u03bd \u2212 \u01eb0ijk \u2202i Jj vk \u2212 2gij \u2207\n2 \u2202S\nS\n\nThe third term in this integral is manifestly positive-definite, whilst the fourth term is\nnegative-definite. However, the fourth term vanishes if the spinor parameter \u03b7 satisfies\n\u02c6 i\u03b7 = 0\n\u03b3i\u2207\n\n(3.15)\n\nthroughout S. In fact, as we shall demonstrate shortly, we can always choose \u03b7 to satisfy\nthis condition, as long as the inequality\nT 0\u03bd u\u03bd \u2212 \u01eb0ijk \u2202i Jj vk \u2265 0\n\n(3.16)\n\nis satisfied throughout S. Therefore, the existence of a current J\u03bc that satisfies the inequality (3.16) is all that is required to show that the integral (3.14) is non-negative.\nTo summarise, we have found that the Bogomol'nyi bound (3.12) can be established\nas long as we can find a current, J\u03bc , satisfying the asymptotic property (3.4), such that\nthe inequality (3.16) holds throughout S.\nLet us now return to the condition (3.15). This is a modified version of the WittenNester condition, which was originally introduced by Witten during his proof of the positive\n\n\u20137\u2013\n\n\fenergy theorem [9]. Adapting Witten's arguments, we shall now show that there always exists an asymptotically modified-Killing spinor field \u03b7 that satisfies this condition throughout\nS.\nWe begin by defining a spinor field \u03b70 that, in the asymptotic region, takes the value\ni\u03b8\n\n\u03b70 = \u03b7\u03ba e\u2212\u03ba 2 ,\n\n(3.17)\n\nwhere \u03b7\u03ba is a spinor, constant in cylindrical coordinates, that satisfies the projection condition\n(1 + i\u03ba\u03b312 )\u03b7\u03ba = 0 .\n(3.18)\nFrom (3.6), we therefore see that \u03b70 is an asymptotically modified-Killing spinor field. A\nmore careful calculation, considering the asymptotic fall-off rates of the metric and matter\nfields, shows that \u03b70 actually behaves as\n\u0012 \u0013\n\u2202z A(\u03b8, z)\n1\ni\u02c6\n\u03b3 \u2207i \u03b70 =\n\u03b70 + O\n,\n(3.19)\nr\nr2\nfor some function A(\u03b8, z), defined on the torus at radial infinity.\nNow, let us consider the inhomogeneous equation\n\u02c6 i \u03b71 = \u2212\u03b3 i \u2207\n\u02c6 i \u03b70 ,\n\u03b3i\u2207\n\n(3.20)\n\nsubject to the boundary condition that \u03b71 vanishes asymptotically. It is straightforward\n\u02c6 i \u03b7 = 0 has no non-zero asymptotically vanishing solutions as long as the\nto show that \u03b3 i \u2207\ninequality (3.16) is satisfied. Therefore, we can formally write down the solution of (3.20)\nas\nZ\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u02c6 i \u03b70 (y) ,\n\u02c6 i \u2212\u03b3 i \u2207\n(3.21)\n\u03b71 (x) = dyG(x, y)\u03b3 i \u2207\nS\n\nwhere G(x, y) is the Green's function of the positive-definite, hermitian second-order op\u02c6 i )2 .\nerator \u2212(i\u03b3 i \u2207\nIf this integral converges, it immediately follows that the spinor \u03b7 = \u03b70 + \u03b71 is both\nasymptotically modified-Killing, with limiting value \u03b70 , and also satisfies the modified\nWitten-Nester condition throughout S.\nTo check the convergence of this integral, we perform a Fourier mode expansion of the\nintegrand along the circular z-direction. From (3.19), it is clear that the zero-frequency\n\u02c6 i \u03b70 vanishes as 1/r 2 , whilst all higher frequency compocomponent of the source term \u03b3 i \u2207\nnents vanish as 1/r. On the other hand, the zero-frequency component of G(x, y) grows\nlogarithmically at large distances, whilst other frequency components decay exponentially.\nPutting these results together, we find that this integral is convergent, and that \u03b71 asymptotically vanishes, at least as fast as (log r)/r.\nBogomol'nyi bounds for the gravitational abelian-Higgs model\nIn order to verify the inequality (3.16), we need to identify a suitable current J\u03bc , which\nsatisfies (3.4). Clearly, the choice of a current J\u03bc that satisfies these conditions must be\n\n\u20138\u2013\n\n\fmade on a model-by-model basis, as this inequality depends on the form of the energymomentum tensor.\nIn fact, for non-gravitational models, a similar inequality,\n\u0001\nT 00 \u2212 \u03ba \u2202r J\u03b8 \u2212 \u2202\u03b8 Jr \u2265 0 ,\n\n(3.22)\n\nis instrumental in establishing Bogomol'nyi bounds. Therefore, for a given gravitational\ntheory, it would be reasonable to identify J\u03bc with the current J\u03bc that is involved in establishing the Bogomol'nyi bound for the corresponding non-gravitational theory. Having\nmade this guess, we would then need to show that this current both satisfies the condition (3.4) and enables us to establish the inequality (3.16).\nWe shall begin by examining the gravitational abelian-Higgs model\n1\n1\nL = R + \u2202\u02c6\u03bc \u03c6\u2217 \u2202\u02c6\u03bc \u03c6 \u2212 F \u03bc\u03bd F\u03bc\u03bd \u2212 \u03b2 2 (\u03c6\u2217 \u03c6 \u2212 \u03be)2 ,\n2\n4\n\n(3.23)\n\nwhere \u03c6 is a U (1)-charged scalar field with covariant derivative\n\u2202\u02c6\u03bc \u03c6 = \u2202\u03bc \u03c6 \u2212 igA\u03bc \u03c6 ,\n\n(3.24)\n\ng is the gauge coupling constant and \u03be is a positive constant.\nThe non-gravitational limit of this theory, the abelian-Higgs model, is the prototype\nfor the traditional Bogomol'nyi procedure: it is the starting point for the Bogomol'nyi rearrangement of the energy-momentum tensors of other non-gravitational theories. Similarly,\nwe shall see that the Bogomol'nyi rearrangement of the gravitational abelian-Higgs theory\nwill enable us to obtain Bogomol'nyi bounds for a variety of gravitational theories.\nIn the (non-gravitational) abelian-Higgs model, the current\nJ\u03bc =\n\n\u0001\u0003\ni \u0002 \u02c6 \u0001\u2217\n\u03c6 \u2202\u03bc \u03c6 \u2212 \u03c6\u2217 \u2202\u02c6\u03bc \u03c6 + g\u03beA\u03bc ,\n2\n\n(3.25)\n\nsatisfies the inequality (3.22) and therefore establishes a Bogomol'nyi bound. J\u03bc also\nprovides us with the topological charge Q = n\u03be, due to the boundary conditions satisfied\nby finite-\u03bc field configurations. Following our earlier discussion, we therefore make the\nidentification J\u03bc = J\u03bc . It is straightforward to check that the same current produces the\nconserved topological charge Q = n\u03be in the gravitational abelian-Higgs theory. Therefore,\nwe now turn to proving the inequality (3.16) for this choice of current.\nThe key to verifying this inequality is to notice that, when the parameters \u03b2 and g are\nin the Bogomol'nyi limit (\u03b2 2 = g2 /2), the gravitational abelian-Higgs model is the bosonic\nlimit of an N = 1 supergravity theory with D-term symmetry breaking \u2013 a model with\na single charged chiral superfield, simple K\u00e4hler potential, a non-zero Fayet-Iliopoulos\nconstant \u03be and a superpotential that is identically zero. Furthermore, our choice of J\u03bc\ncoincides with the gravitino U (1) connection AB\n\u03bc.\nA gravitational Bogomol'nyi bound has already been established for this theory in [11],\nwhere it was noticed that the total energy for this system could be written as the sum\nof squares of the fermionic supersymmetry transformations. In terms of the formalism\n\n\u20139\u2013\n\n\fdescribed here, this is equivalent to showing that the left-hand side of the inequality (3.16)\ncan be written as a sum of squares of certain spinorial quantities, defined as follows:\n\u0001\ni\n\u03b4\u03c7 = \u2212 \u03b3 \u03bc \u2202\u02c6\u03bc \u03c6 \u03b7 ,\n2\ni\ng\n\u03b4\u03bb = \u2212 \u03b3 \u03bc\u03bd F\u03bc\u03bd \u03b7 \u2212 (\u03c6\u2217 \u03c6 \u2212 \u03be)\u03b7 .\n4\n2\n\n(3.26)\n(3.27)\n\nAs the notation suggests, these quantities are clearly related to the higgsino and gaugino\nsupersymmetry transformations respectively. In fact, each is a linear combination of supersymmetry transformations given by the two Weyl components that are encoded in the\n\u02c6 \u03bc \u03b7 is a linear combination of\nDirac spinor \u03b7. Furthermore, with J\u03bc defined as in (3.25), \u2207\ngravitino supersymmetry transformations in the same manner.\nWith a little effort, one can show that\nh\ni\ng\n4\u03b4\u03c7\u03b3 \u03bc \u03b4\u03c7 = \u2202\u02c6\u03bc \u03c6\u2217 \u2202\u02c6\u03bd \u03c6 + \u2202\u02c6\u03bd \u03c6\u2217 \u2202\u02c6\u03bc \u03c6 \u2212 \u03b4\u03bc\u03bd \u2202\u02c6\u03c1 \u03c6\u2217 \u2202\u02c6\u03c1 \u03c6 u\u03bd \u2212 \u01eb\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1\u03c3 \u2202\u03bd J\u03c1 v\u03c3 \u2212 (\u03c6\u2217 \u03c6 \u2212 \u03be)\u01eb\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1\u03c3 F\u03bd\u03c1 v\u03c3 ,\n2\n(3.28)\nand\n\"\n\u0013#\n\u0012\n2\ng\ng\n1\n2\u03b4\u03bb\u03b3 \u03bc \u03b4\u03bb = F \u03bc\u03c1 F\u03c1\u03bd \u2212 \u03b4\u03bc\u03bd \u2212 F \u03c1\u03c3 F\u03c1\u03c3 \u2212 (\u03c6\u2217 \u03c6\u2212 \u03be) u\u03bd + (\u03c6\u2217 \u03c6\u2212 \u03be)\u01eb\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1\u03c3 F\u03bd\u03c1 v\u03c3 . (3.29)\n4\n2\n2\nHence we can rewrite the left-hand side of (3.16) as a sum of squares:\n\u0012\n\u0013\ng2\n0ijk\n\u2020\n\u2020\n2\n0 \u03bd\nT \u03bd u \u2212 \u01eb \u2202i Jj vk = 4\u03b4\u03c7 \u03b4\u03c7 + 2\u03b4\u03bb \u03b4\u03bb + \u03b2 \u2212\n(\u03c6\u2217 \u03c6 \u2212 \u03be)2 .\n2\n\n(3.30)\n\nTherefore, provided that \u03b2 2 \u2265 g2 /2, we obtain the Bogomol'nyi bound\n\u03bc \u2265 2\u03c0|n|\u03be .\n\n(3.31)\n\nIn the Bogomol'nyi limit \u03b2 2 = g2 /2, this bound is saturated when each positive-definite\nterm in (3.14) vanishes throughout S. This yields the following Bogomol'nyi equations:\n\u02c6 i\u03b7 = 0 .\n\u03b4\u03c7 = \u03b4\u03bb = \u2207\n\n(3.32)\n\nNotice that the Bogomol'nyi equation for \u03b7 implies that u\u03bc and v \u03bc are constant (and\nKilling) throughout S. The existence of these two Killing vectors implies that minimumenergy cosmic string solutions are static and translationally invariant along the z-axis\n(cf. the traditional gravitational Bogomol'nyi method, following [2], where these symmetries were assumed, rather than derived). Furthermore, regarding this theory as a D-term\nsupergravity model, solutions of the Bogomol'nyi equations (3.32) partially preserve supersymmetry \u2013 i.e. they are BPS solutions.\nBogomol'nyi bounds for other gravitational field theories\nHaving obtained a Bogomol'nyi bound and Bogomol'nyi equations for the gravitational\nabelian-Higgs theory, it is now possible to construct Bogomol'nyi bounds and equations for\nother gravitational field theories.\n\n\u2013 10 \u2013\n\n\fThis is achieved by noticing that any symmetry-breaking term of the form\n\u0002\n\u00032\n\u03b22 M \u2212 \u03be ,\n\n(3.33)\n\nwhere M is a real-valued quadratic form with respect to the scalar fields \u03c6i and their\ncomplex conjugates \u03c6\u2217i , can be brought to the form\n\u00132\n\u0012X\n2\n2\n,\n(3.34)\nqi |\u03c8i | \u2212 \u03be\u0303\n\u03b2\u0303\ni\n\nwhere \u03c8i are a suitably chosen (charge-preserving) unitary transformation of the fields \u03c6i ,\nand qi are the charges of the fields \u03c8i . Furthermore, such a transformation will leave the\nkinetic terms in the energy-momentum tensor unchanged:\nX\nX\n|\u2202\u03c6i |2 =\n|\u2202\u03c8i |2 .\n(3.35)\ni\n\ni\n\nTherefore, this field transformation effectively turns any theory that contains a symmetry\nbreaking potential of the form (3.33) into an abelian-Higgs theory (perhaps with some extra\nterms in the scalar potential). Hence we can minimise the energy by applying the abelianHiggs Bogomol'nyi rearrangement to the energy-momentum tensor, written in terms of the\nnew fields \u03c8i .\nAs a concrete example, let us consider a popular model from N = 1 supergravity \u2013\nan F -term symmetry-breaking model containing three chiral superfields \u03a60 and \u03a6\u00b1 , with\ncharges 0 and \u00b11, and the superpotential\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u03beF\nW = \u03b2\u03a60 \u03a6+ \u03a6\u2212 \u2212\n,\n(3.36)\n2\nwhere \u03beF is a positive constant. This superpotential gives rise to the following symmetrybreaking scalar potential:\nV = \u03b12 (Re F )2 + Vrest ,\n(3.37)\nwhere\n\u0002\n\u0003 P 2\n\u03b12 = \u03b2 2 (1 \u2212 |\u03c60 |2 )2 + |\u03c60 |2 e i |\u03c6i| ,\nF = \u03c6+ \u03c6\u2212 \u2212 \u03beF /2 ,\n\n(3.38)\n(3.39)\n\nand\n\u00112\nh\ni\ng2 \u0010\n|\u03c6+ |2 \u2212 |\u03c6\u2212 |2 .\n|\u03c6\u2212 + \u03c6\u2217+ F |2 + |\u03c6+ + \u03c6\u2217\u2212 F |2 + \u03b12 (Im F )2 +\n2f\n(3.40)\nThe function f is the gauge kinetic function, which appears in the bosonic Lagrangian as\nfollows:\nX\nf\n1\n\u2202\u02c6\u03bc \u03c6i \u2217 \u2202\u02c6\u03bc \u03c6i \u2212 F \u03bc\u03bd F\u03bc\u03bd \u2212 V .\n(3.41)\nL= R+\n2\n4\nP\n\nVrest = \u03b2 2 |\u03c60 |2 e\n\ni |\u03c6i|\n\n2\n\ni\n\nWe will leave f unspecified for now, so that we can examine how our choice of f affects\nthe existence, and attainability, of a Bogomol'nyi bound for this model.\n\n\u2013 11 \u2013\n\n\fWe shall now consider topological cosmic strings in the bosonic limit of this model. The\nscalar potential V is manifestly non-negative, and takes the minimum value of zero when\n\u221a\n\u03c60 = 0, |\u03c6+ | = \u03be and \u03c6\u2212 = \u03c6\u2217+ . Therefore the vacuum manifold has a U (1) topology,\nand this model admits topological cosmic string configurations.\nIf we now rotate to the fields \u03c80 and \u03c8\u00b1 , where\n\u03c80 = \u03c60\n\n\u0001\n1\n\u03c8\u00b1 = \u221a \u03c6\u00b1 \u00b1 \u03c6\u2217\u2213 ,\n2\n\nand\n\nthen we find that V becomes\n\n\u00112\n\u03b12 \u0010\n|\u03c8+ |2 \u2212 |\u03c8\u2212 |2 \u2212 \u03beF + Vrest ,\n4\n\nV =\n\n(3.42)\n\n(3.43)\n\nwhilst the kinetic terms in the energy-momentum tensor are unchanged. Therefore, written\nin terms of the new fields \u03c80 and \u03c8\u00b1 , this F -term model has an energy-momentum tensor\nwhich is the sum of the abelian-Higgs energy-momentum tensor and the scalar potential\nVrest .\nHence, by generalising \u03b4\u03c7 and \u03b4\u03bb as follows\n\u0001\ni\n\u03b4\u03c7i = \u2212 \u03b3 \u03bc \u2202\u02c6\u03bc \u03c8i \u03b7 ,\n2\n\u0013\n\u0012\ng X\ni \u03bc\u03bd\n2\nqi |\u03c8i | \u2212 \u03beF \u03b7 ,\n\u03b4\u03bb = \u2212 \u03b3 F\u03bc\u03bd \u03b7 \u2212\n4\n2\n\n(3.44)\n(3.45)\n\ni\n\nand using the current\nJ\u03bc =\n\n\u0001\u2217\n\u0001\u0003\niX \u0002\nqi \u03c8i \u2202\u02c6\u03bc \u03c8i \u2212 \u03c8i \u2217 \u2202\u02c6\u03bc \u03c8i + g\u03beF A\u03bc ,\n2\n\n(3.46)\n\ni\n\nwhich can easily be shown to satisfy the condition (3.4), thereby enabling the existence of\nasymptotically modified-Killing spinors, we find that\n\u0012X\n\u00132\n1 2\n2\n2\nqi |\u03c8i | \u2212 \u03beF\n+ Vrest .\n(\u03b1 f \u2212 2g )\n\u2212 \u01eb \u2202i Jj vk =\n4\u03b4\u03c7i \u03b4\u03c7i + 2\u03b4\u03bb \u03b4\u03bb +\n4f\ni\ni\n(3.47)\nSubstituting this into (3.14), we obtain the Bogomol'nyi bound\n\nT 0\u03bd u\u03bd\n\n0ijk\n\nX\n\n\u2020\n\n\u2020\n\n\u03bc \u2265 2\u03c0|n|\u03beF ,\n\n(3.48)\n\nprovided that f satisfies the inequality \u03b12 f \u2265 2g 2 .\nFor the usual choice f = 1, this inequality is satisfied as long as \u03b2 2 = 2g 2 , since\n\u03b12 \u2265 1 everywhere. However, the inequality cannot be saturated everywhere, and hence\nthis Bogomol'nyi bound cannot be saturated either.\nFor this Bogomol'nyi bound to be attainable, we need to choose f according to the\nformula \u03b12 f = 2g2 . This corresponds to the Bogomol'nyi limit, or critical coupling, in the\nabelian-Higgs model, where we had to relate the gauge coupling constant to the mass of the\n\n\u2013 12 \u2013\n\n\fscalar field in order to obtain an attainable bound. For this choice of f , this Bogomol'nyi\nbound is saturated by field configurations that satisfy the following Bogomol'nyi equations:\n\u02c6 i \u03b7 = Vrest = 0 .\n\u03b4\u03c7i = \u03b4\u03bb = \u2207\n\n(3.49)\n\nWe note that, just as the non-gravitational version of this model has embedded NielsenOlesen strings as minimum-energy solutions, the above Bogomol'nyi equations are solved\nby embedded minimum-energy solutions of the gravitational abelian-Higgs model.\nLet us now consider the relationship between these results and supersymmetry. The\nLagrangian we have just considered is derived from the bosonic limit of an F -term N = 1\nsupergravity model. For this model, with its non-vanishing superpotential, it is easily seen\nthat the BPS equations cannot be satisfied [14] \u2013 i.e. there are no non-trivial minimumenergy configurations that preserve any degree of supersymmetry.3 Therefore, it may\ninitially seem rather surprising that we have been able to obtain an energetic Bogomol'nyi\nbound for this Lagrangian. However, on closer inspection, this result turns out to be a\nconsistent generalisation of analogous results for F -term strings in both (global) supersymmetry and supergravity in the cylindrically symmetric limit \u2013 that, although the BPS\nequations cannot be satisfied, one can still establish an energetic Bogomol'nyi bound [4].\nThe relationship between our energetic Bogomol'nyi bound and the non-existence of\nsupersymmetric solutions manifests itself in a number of ways. Firstly, it is clear that the\nBogomol'nyi equations (3.49) are not equivalent to the F -term BPS equations. Secondly,\nthe Bogomol'nyi bound is only attainable when \u03b12 f = 2g 2 \u2013 a choice which would result in\nf not being holomorphic, and therefore not a valid choice if (3.41) is to be the bosonic part\nof a supergravity Lagrangian. Furthermore, and most importantly, the current J\u03bc is not the\ngravitino U (1) connection AB\n\u03bc \u2013 a key result that enabled us to find an appropriate spinor\nparameter \u03b7 for the Witten-Nester energy when Killing spinors, in the usual supergravity\nsense, cannot exist for \u03b4 > 0.\n\n4. Comparison to Bogomol'nyi bounds for non-gravitational theories\nThere is a strong analogy between the gravitational Bogomol'nyi method we have presented\nhere and the traditional Bogomol'nyi procedure for vortices in non-gravitational models.\nIn fact, it is more appropriate to say that our new method is really a generalisation of the\nnon-gravitational Bogomol'nyi method.\nThis analogy begins with the Witten-Nester energy expression which, as mentioned\nearlier, is the gravitational energy expression that is closest, for our purposes, to the definition of the total energy in Minkowski spacetime. Using the Witten-Nester energy, we were\nable to come up with an inequality (3.16), that must be satisfied in order to establish a\ngravitational Bogomol'nyi bound. As we saw there, this inequality is a generalised version\nof the inequality (3.22) that is obtained by the non-gravitational Bogomol'nyi procedure.\n3\n\nIn this paper, we take Bogomol'nyi equations to be the equations that characterise minimum-energy\nsolutions, whilst BPS equations are the equations that characterise partially supersymmetric field configurations. Although these two properties often come hand in hand, this is not the case here, and we must\ntherefore distinguish between the equations that characterise these two properties.\n\n\u2013 13 \u2013\n\n\fFurthermore, the identities (3.28) and (3.29) are generalisations of the Minkowski\nspacetime identities\ni\n\u2202\u02c6r \u03c6 \u00b1 \u2202\u02c6\u03b8 \u03c6\nr\nand\n\n2\n\n1\ng\n1\n2\n2\n= \u2202\u02c6r \u03c6 + 2 \u2202\u02c6\u03b8 \u03c6 + \u2213 (\u2202r J\u03b8 \u2212 \u2202\u03b8 Jr ) \u2213 Fr\u03b8 (\u03c6\u2217 \u03c6 \u2212 \u03be) ,\nr\nr\nr\n\n\u00132\n\u0012\n1 Fr\u03b8\nFr\u03b8 2 g2 \u2217\ng\n\u2217\n\u00b1 g(\u03c6 \u03c6 \u2212 \u03be) =\n+ (\u03c6 \u03c6 \u2212 \u03be)2 \u00b1 Fr\u03b8 (\u03c6\u2217 \u03c6 \u2212 \u03be) ,\n2\n2 r\n2r\n2\nr\n\n(4.1)\n\n(4.2)\n\nthat are used in the non-gravitational Bogomol'nyi method to write the left-hand side of\n(3.22) as a sum of squares.\nFinally, the field transformation technique discussed above \u2013 which relates many gravitational field theories to the gravitational abelian-Higgs model, and therefore allows us\nto construct Bogomol'nyi bounds for these theories \u2013 also relates the Bogomol'nyi bounds\nand equations of the non-gravitational versions of these theories to the non-gravitational\nabelian-Higgs model.\nThis correspondence between the gravitational Bogomol'nyi method presented here\nand the traditional Bogomol'nyi method for non-gravitational theories demonstrates that\nnon-gravitational Bogomol'nyi bounds do survive coupling to gravity. Wherever we can\nconstruct a Bogomol'nyi bound for a non-gravitational theory, we can use the techniques\ndescribed above to generalise this Bogomol'nyi rearrangement, and therefore provide a\nBogomol'nyi bound for the gravitational version of the same theory.\nIn this manner, we can establish Bogomol'nyi bounds for many other gravitational\ntheories that are currently of cosmological interest \u2013 such as P -term models [5], semilocal models [15], and D-term models with non-zero superpotentials \u2013 where Bogomol'nyi\nrearrangements are already known in the non-gravitational limit.\n\n5. Conclusion\nWe have presented a general method for establishing Bogomol'nyi bounds and finding\nminimum-energy cosmic string solutions that can be applied to a wide range of gravitational\nfield theories that contain symmetry-breaking scalar potentials. Unlike the traditional\nmethod for establishing energy bounds for gravitational theories [2], this new method\ndoes not involve making any prior assumptions about the symmetries of minimum-energy\nsolutions.\nOur work generalises the results of [10] and [11], regarding certain D-term supergravity\nmodels. Although the algebraic manipulations that enabled us to derive these bounds were\nborrowed from D-term supergravity, they were actually found to be applicable to a wide\nvariety of (possibly non-supersymmetric) theories.\nIn fact we have seen, in Section 4, that these manipulations, although taken from\na supersymmetric context, are really the covariant generalisations of the key identities\nthat were used to derive the non-gravitational Bogomol'nyi bound for the abelian-Higgs\nmodel. In this sense, our procedure is really a covariant generalisation of the traditional\nBogomol'nyi procedure. Therefore, we can confirm that all results that have been proven\n\n\u2013 14 \u2013\n\n\fso far by making assumptions about the symmetry of the metric and using the traditional\nBogomol'nyi technique, still hold when one allows for asymmetric perturbations.\nWe applied our technique to the particular example of the bosonic Lagrangian for\nF -term strings in N = 1 supergravity. Here, we found an energetic Bogomol'nyi bound\nand corresponding Bogomol'nyi equations \u2013 however, this bound is unnattainable for any\nholomorphic choice of gauge kinetic function. These results, which have been derived for\ncylindrically symmetric strings in [4], have therefore been generalised by this technique to\ncover cylindrically asymmetric field configurations.\nThe Bogomol'nyi equations obtained using this new technique confirm that minimumenergy solutions are static and straight \u2013 symmetries that were previously assumed rather\nthan proved. Furthermore these equations allow for the same cylindrically symmetric\nsingle-vortex solutions as the Bogomol'nyi equations of the traditional method, thereby\nconfirming the stability of these solutions against decay to asymmetric field configurations\nof lower energy.\nHowever, the new Bogomol'nyi equations do not necessarily imply that minimumenergy solutions must be cylindrically symmetric. Therefore, it would be interesting to\nlook for multi-string configurations that saturate the Bogomol'nyi bound, in analogy with\nthe static multi-vortex solutions that exist in non-gravitational field theories. To find such\nsolutions, one would presumably have to repeat Taubes's analysis of the abelian-Higgs\nBogomol'nyi equations [16] for the gravitational Bogomol'nyi equations (3.32).\n\nAcknowledgements\nWe would like to thank P.

The energy of cosmic string spacetimes\nIn Section 2 we claimed that any surface integral expression for the energy of a canonical\nasymptotically flat spacetime can also be used to calculate the energy of a cosmic string\nspacetime, provided that the surface of integration is changed from the sphere at spatial\ninfinity to the torus at radial infinity. Then, in Section 3, we employed this result to\ninterpret the surface integral of E \u03bc\u03bd .\nThere are many ways to check this assertion. One would be to see whether an energy\nexpression obtained in this manner is equivalent to the gravitational Hamiltonian obtained\nby following the background-subtraction procedure described by Hawking and Horowitz\n[17]. However, here we shall adopt a more pedagogical approach by employing the principles\nthat were used to define the ADM energy of canonical asymptotically flat spacetimes to\ndefine an equivalent energy for cosmic string spacetimes.\nWe begin by considering linearised gravity on a static, cylindrically symmetric background. More specifically, let us consider a spacetime that admits global cylindrical polar\ncoordinates, in which the metric may be written\ng\u03bc\u03bd = g\u0303\u03bc\u03bd + \u01ebh\u03bc\u03bd ,\n\n\u2013 15 \u2013\n\n(A.1)\n\n\fwhere\ng\u0303\u03bc\u03bd dx\u03bc dx\u03bd = dt2 \u2212 dr 2 \u2212 C(r)2 d\u03b8 2 \u2212 dz 2\n\n(A.2)\n\nis a static, cylindrically symmetric background metric, and \u01eb is a small parameter, with\nrespect to which we shall linearise all quantities. We shall also assume that C \u2032 (0) = 0 and\n\u03b4\n)r as r \u2192 \u221e, so that the background metric is completely regular, with\nC(r) \u2192 (1 \u2212 2\u03c0\ndeficit angle \u03b4.\nIn the linearised theory, the dynamics of the matter fields take place with respect to\nthe fixed background (to leading order), and therefore the energy may be defined in a\nspecial-relativistic sense, in terms of the linearised energy-momentum tensor:\nZ\np\np\u03bc u\u03bc = d3 x \u2212g\u0303T (L)0 \u03bd u\u03bd ,\n(A.3)\nS\n\nwhere S is a background-static, spacelike hypersurface whose normal vector points in the\n(timelike and background-Killing) t-direction, and u\u03bc is a constant, timelike vector that\nrepresents the 4-velocity of the observer at spacelike infinity who is measuring the energy\n(L)\u03bc\n(L)\u03bc\nof the system. Due to Einstein's equation, we can replace T\n\u03bd , the linearised\n\u03bd with G\nEinstein tensor, in the above expression.\n(L)\u03bc\u03bd\nIt is possible to express the linearised Riemann tensor R\n\u03c1\u03c3 in terms of the back-\n\nground Riemann tensor R\u0303\u03bc\u03bd \u03c1\u03c3 , the background metric connection \u0393\u0303\u03bc\u03bd \u03c1 , and the linearised\nperturbation of the spin connection \u2206\u03c9\u03c1 \u03bc\u03bd , in the following manner:\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u03c4 [\u03bc \u03bd]\n\u03bc\u03bd\n(L)\u03bc\u03bd\n\u03bc\u03bd\n.\n(A.4)\n\u2212\n2\u2206\u03c9\n\u0393\u0303\n+\n2\n\u2206\u03c9\n=\nR\u0303\nR\n\u03c1\u03c3\n[\u03c1\n\u03c3]\u03c4\n[\u03c1 ,\u03c3]\n\u03c1\u03c3\n\nWith the aid of this expression, along with the identity\nG\u03bc\u03bd =\n\n1 \u03c1\u03bc\u03b3\u03b4\n\u01eb\n\u01eb\u03c1\u03bd\u03b1\u03b2 R\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3\u03b4 ,\n4\n\n(A.5)\n\nwe can rewrite (A.3) as follows:\n1\np u\u03bc = 2\u03c0\u03b4Lz +\n4\n\u03bc\n\nZ\n\ndS\u03bc\u03bd \u03b5\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1\u03c3 \u03b5\u03b4\u03b1\u03b2\u03c3 \u2206\u03c9\u03c1 \u03b1\u03b2 u\u03b4 .\n\n(A.6)\n\n\u2202S\n\nWe note that this expression is formally equivalent to Nester's expression of the ADM\nenergy in [13].\nNow that we have an expression for the energy which only depends on the asymptotic\nbehaviour of the system, we may allow u\u03bc to be any asymptotically constant, timelike vector\nfield. Similarly, we may now allow S to be any maximal spacelike hypersurface, with a\ntimelike, asymptotically Killing normal vector. In this manner, we obtain an expression for\nthe energy which only depends on the asymptotic form of the metric.\nNow we invoke the canonical argument that, on physical grounds, we require the mass\nof a system to be determined purely by the long-distance behaviour of the metric, and hence\nbe independent of the fields in the interior of the system. This implies that the expression\n(A.6) represents the total energy of any spacetime that is asymptotically cylindrically\nsymmetric, irrespective of its behaviour in the interior. In other words, (A.6) represents\nthe energy of any cosmic string spacetime.\n\n\u2013 16 \u2013\n\n\fIt is straightforward to check that the surface integral of E \u03bc\u03bd equals this energy expression, by decomposing the spin connection in the asymptotic region as\n\u03c9\u03bc\n\n\u03b1\u03b2\n\n= \u03c9\u0303\u03bc\n\n\u03b1\u03b2\n\n+ \u2206\u03c9\u03bc\n\n\u03b1\u03b2\n\n,\n\n(A.7)\n\n\u03b1\u03b2\n\nwhere \u03c9\u0303\u03bc is the spin connection for a cylindrically symmetric metric of identical conical\ndeficit angle.\n\nReferences\n[1] N.
