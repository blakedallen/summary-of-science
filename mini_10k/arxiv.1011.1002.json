The system additionally exhibits S-shaped doubly reentrant phase sequences as well\nas critical isostructural transitions between crystals of different average lattice site occupancy. Due\nto the possible annihilation of lattice sites and accompanying clustering, the system moreover shows\nan unusual softening upon compression.\nPACS numbers: 64.70.K-,64.70.D-,82.30.Nr,62.20.-x\n\nSince van der Waals and Kirkwood, we better appreciate the fundamental role of harshly repulsive interactions\nin the organization of matter [1]. But what happens when\nharshness turns into softness? Core softened potentials\ncan exhibit microphase separation [2], reentrant melting,\nand isostructural phase transitions [3], as found in systems as diverse as Cerium metal [4], star polymers [5],\ndipolar spheres [6], electron bubbles [7, 8], and rotating\nBose gases [9]. Even softer coreless repulsive interactions\nare also found in complex systems. Nonlinear fields can\nform particle-like structures governed by soliton-like interactions [10, 11]; and for structures with low fractal\ndimension, such as polymers [12], dendrimers [13, 14],\nand microgels [15], the centers of mass can be immaterial\nand thus overlap with only a finite free energy penalty.\nAs a result, materials governed by such interactions exhibit unusual phenomenology compared to \"simple\" matter [16]. Soft core models are further used to study the\ndifficult glass [17, 18] and classical ground state determination problems [19, 20], highlighting the broad interest\nin the behavior of systems with soft potentials.\nA certain universality permeates the thermodynamic\nassembly of systems governed by bounded, purely repulsive interactions. Two phenomenological categories\nhave been identified from a mean-field analysis. Systems with pair interactions whose Fourier components\nare purely positive are expected to show reentrant melting, while those with some negative Fourier components\nshould cluster and freeze into multiply occupied crystals (MOC) upon compression [17, 21\u201327]. Crossing the\ndivide between the two categories can be realized via\nthe tuneable generalized exponential model of index n\n(GEM-n) [23], whose pair potential for particles a distance r apart is\n\u03c6(r) = \u03b5 exp [\u2212(r/\u03c3)n ] ,\n\n(1)\n\nwith \u03b5 and \u03c3 setting the units of energy and length, respectively [28]. Upon compression at low temperatures,\nthe n = 2 Gaussian core model (GCM) [29], which has\na purely positive Fourier transform, forms cubic crystals\n\nthat eventually remelt [30, 31]; while all GEM-n of n > 2\nhave some negative Fourier components and are thus predicted to form MOC at high temperatures [22], including\nthe n \u2192 \u221e penetrable sphere model (PSM) limit [21].\nFor strong interactions (or effective low temperatures),\nwhich may be the experimentally most relevant regime,\nthe phase behavior of MOC-forming systems is not understood. Various plausible ordering scenarios upon\ncompression are suggested by theory and experiments:\ndensity functional theory predicts a continuous increase\nin clustering [22, 23]; the PSM limit presents a sequence of second-order phase transitions between crystals of increasing occupancy [21]; and bubble solids alternate liquid and crystal phases of increasing lattice\noccupancy [7]. A cascade of pure first-order isostructural solid-solid transitions between crystals of different\noccupancy is also plausible, as theoretically predicted by\nRef. [32]. Such isostructural transitions should terminate\nat critical points, because the cluster occupancy of hightemperature MOC-formers increases continuously with\ndensity [23, 24]. A rare example of this type of critical point is found in pure Cerium, where a pressureinduced electronic promotion underlies the transition between two isostructural solids with different lattice spacing [4, 33]. Critical points involving volume collapse have\nalso been predicted for a variety of purely classical, discontinuous model potentials [3, 34]. But the experimental colloidal systems in which they could be observed have\nintrinsic size polydispersity [35] or smooth effective interactions [16] that inhibit phase separation. The relatively\nbroad lattice spacing of MOC and their smooth interaction form suggest that crystal formation should be less\nsensitive to these experimental constraints.\nIn this letter, we present a computational study of the\nlow-temperature behavior of the MOC-forming GEM-4.\nIts phase behavior is shown to be a complex hybrid between the GCM and the PSM limits.

The pressure P is obtained from the virial and the Helmholtz\nfree energy F of the different phases is calculated via\nthermodynamic integration. The ideal gas reference [37]\nis complemented, for the body-centered cubic (bcc) and\nface-centered cubic (fcc) crystal phases, with a potential well centered around each of the Nc lattice sites [27].\nThis crystal reference, by allowing for the characteristic\nmultiple occupation of lattice sites and for particle hopping between those sites, permits a reversible integration\npath. For a fixed number density \u03c1, the average lattice\nsite occupancy nc = N/Nc at equilibrium is identified for\nevery state point by simulating crystals at various fixed\nnc then minimizing the resulting constrained free energy\nF (nc ), i.e., identifying the loci F (neq\nc ) such that (Fig. 1)\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u2202F (nc )\n= 0,\n(2)\n\u2202nc \u03c1,T,nc =neq\nc\nsimilarly to the scheme employed in Ref. [38] and that\nused for GEM-4's high-T phase diagram determination.\nIn the latter, nc was tuned until the (unphysical) field\nconjugate to nc had vanished [24, 39], which allows for a\ngradient-based minimization of F , but relies on an additional independent calculation of the chemical potential\n\u03bc. This approach breaks down at low T , where \u03bc cannot\nbe efficiently resolved by Widom's particle insertion [37].\nPhase coexistence is then determined through common\ntangent construction of the free energy data. A linear\ntransformation \u03b2 F\u0303 \u03c1/N = \u03b2F \u03c1/N \u2212 \u03ba\u03c1 with inverse temperature \u03b2 and arbitrary unitless parameter \u03ba enhances\n\nthe visibility of the coexistence regime (Fig. 2).\nWe present two projections of the the low-T phase diagram in Fig. 1. As anticipated from the high-T extrapolation, the cluster bcc phase vanishes at a triple\n(1)\npoint Tt = 0.078(1). But surprisingly the transition is\npreceded by a S-shaped doubly reentrant (SDR) crystal\nphase sequence, where both a maximum and a minimum\n(1)\nin the coexistence curve are observed. Below Tt the\nphase diagram is surprisingly rich. GCM-like phase behavior [29\u201331] is followed by an unexpectedly complex\nclustering regime. Because the tail of the GEM-4 decays\nfaster than any inverse power, the liquid freezes into a\nsingle-occupancy fcc (fcc1) that reaches vanishingly small\ndensities at low T , in agreement with predictions from genetic algorithms [40, 41] and phonon theory [32]. This\nfcc1 phase gives way to a single-occupancy bcc (bcc1)\n(2)\nphase at a second triple point Tt = 0.031(1). For a\n(2)\nnarrow temperature range above Tt , a bcc1 wedge between the liquid and the fcc1 phase leads to reentrant\ncrystallization of bcc1 upon compression. The maximum\nfreezing temperature for bcc1 at T = 0.039(1) leads to\na second SDR sequence similar to that observed in the\nhard core/soft shoulder model [3, 4]. By contrast to the\nGCM's reentrant melting behavior [29\u201331], here the liquid reentrance section of the SDR sequence spreads only\nover a finite density regime 0.59 . \u03c1 . 0.68 and over a\nmuch smaller temperature range 0.0385 . T . 0.039.\nThe intermediate nature of the GEM-4 suggests that\nthis reentrance might become more pronounced as the\nGCM is approached, i.e., n \u2192 2+ , and should disappear before the PSM limit n \u2192 \u221e, where reentrance\nis not expected [21].

Both curves show the van der Waals loop\ncharacteristic of a system whose limited size inhibits phase\nseparation. The coexistence densities of the fcc1 (left inset)fcc2 (right inset) isostructrual transition are determined by\nthe common tangent construction (dashed line). The equilibrium lattice occupancy neq\nc (\u2022) plateaus near integer values\nfor the thermodynamically stable phases.\n\nand low-T regimes occurs through a third triple point\n(3)\nTt = 0.040(1), at which bcc1 vanishes. A prior, coarser\nstudy of the liquid-crystal transition in this regime missed\nboth the presence of fcc1 and of the reentrant melting [42]. It also inaccurately assigned the unusual shape\nof the liquid-crystal coexistence curve to the onset of clustering, while it is rather caused by the reentrant melting.\nClustering does indeed influence the phase diagram\ntopology, but at densities further away from the liquid\nphase. At low T the nature of clustering is unlike what is\nseen at higher T , where nc changes linearly with \u03c1 resulting in a nearly density independent lattice constant [24].\nHere, nc is quasi-quantized, and at very low T the lattice\nconstant a changes discontinuously through isostructural\ntransitions between fcc lattices of nearly perfect integer\nmean occupancy nc \u2194 nc + 1 (Figs. 2-3). The first occurrence of these transitions, fcc1 \u2194 fcc2, is partially\ninterrupted by the bcc1 phase, down to the fourth triple\n(4)\npoint Tt = 0.012(1) (Fig. 1). But at higher densities,\nthe fcc2 \u2194 fcc3 coexistence is fully developed. No other\nliquid or crystal phases are found to interfere and genetic\nalgorithm results corroborate that no other crystal symmetry should be stable in this density regime [40, 41].\nIt is at the moment computationally difficult to go beyond fcc3, but both a zero temperature treatment paired\nwith phonon theory [32] and a simple mean-field cell\ntheory predict a cascade of nc \u2194 nc + 1 isostructural\ntransitions to carry on ad infinitum, slightly broadening the coexistence regime between two integer occupancies.

Hopping between lattice sites\n(n ,n +1)\nshould depress Tc c c\nas nc increases, and mean-field\ncritical universality is generally expected [22, 43]. The series of first-order isostructural transitions contrasts with\nthe continuous second-order clustering transitions for the\nPSM predicted by cell theory [21]. This last observation\nsuggests that the behavior of the PSM might be singular,\nbut further studies are necessary to clarify the GEM-n\nfamily phase behavior as n \u2192 \u221e.\nOne of the key material properties of MOC is the presence of two distinct microscopic mechanisms for responding to compression. Like any other crystal, MOC can\naffinely reduce their lattice constant, but additionally\nthey can eliminate lattice sites by increasing the mean\nlattice occupancy. We can decompose the bulk modulus\n\u0012 2 \u0013\n\u2202 F\nB\u2261V\n= Bvir \u2212 Bcorr\n(3)\n\u2202V 2 N,T\ninto a constant nc virial contribution Bvir and a \"softening\" correction Bcorr , which map directly to the two\nmicroscopic mechanisms [24, 44]. At high T , Bcorr can\nbe as high as half the virial component [24], but in low T\ncrystals, the quasi-quantized jumps in nc lead to a significantly different mechanical behavior. Away from the coexistence regions, where nc is nearly constant, the system\nresponds only affinely to isothermal compression and the\nvirial contribution to the bulk modulus captures the full\nresponse of the system, i.e., Bcorr \u223c 0, (Fig. 3) [45]. But\nin the softening regions that precede and follow the phase\ntransitions the quantization is imperfect, and Bcorr 6= 0.\n\n\f4\nNear the bcc1-fcc2 transition, for instance, Bcorr is nearly\nequal to the virial contribution, which means that the\nsystem exerts almost no resistance to compression. This\nvery rapid change in mechanical properties with compression is uncommon, and may lead to novel material behavior. The different physical natures of the virial and softening contributions indeed suggest a separation of time\nscales for their microscopic relaxation, with slow particle redistributions contrasted by fast affine deformations.\nHardening or softening of the material upon compression\nmight thus depend on the deformation rate.\nWe have presented the intriguing low-temperature\nphase behavior of the MOC-forming GEM-4 through a\nnumerical method specially designed for this class of systems. The complexity of the phase behavior is particularly noteworthy considering the simplicity of the\nmodel, which is free of competing length scales. Experimental soft matter realizations of MOC are still lacking, but large-scale, monomer-resolved simulations of amphiphilic cluster-forming dendrimers are currently under way [46]. Importantly, the approach outlined in the\npresent work should be directly applicable to phenomena of reversible cluster formation in other branches of\nphysics. Examples are: the structures formed by the soft\nsolitons [10, 11], the quasi-2D electron bubbles in the\nquantum-Hall regime [7, 8], and the predicted clustering\nof vortex lines in rotating Bose gases [9].\nWe thank D.
