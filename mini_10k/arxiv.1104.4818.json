Introduction\nHigh\u2013order perturbation calculations in atomic physics generally require summations\nover the complete spectrum of the system under consideration. Within the relativistic\nframework, such a \"summation\" is not a simple task since it includes a summation\nover discrete part of the Dirac spectrum as well as the integration over the positive\u2013 as\nwell as negative\u2013energy continua. A number of methods have been developed over the\npast decades to perform this summation consistently. Apart from the various Green's\nfunction approaches [1, 2], the discrete\u2013basis\u2013set method is widely employed nowadays\nin (relativistic as well as non\u2013relativistic) high\u2013order calculations [3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. In this\nmethod, a finite set of discrete pseudostates is constructed from some basis functions\nand utilized for carrying out the summation. The particular choice of a suitable set\nof basis functions is crucial for the practical implication of the method. Usually, the\ndiscrete (pseudo\u2013) solutions are built up from piecewise polynomial sets. The piecewise\npolynomials are precisely defined, can be calculated rapidly on modern computer\nsystems, and can represent a great variety of functions. They can be differentiated\nand integrated easily [8].\nThe basis splines [9], also called B\u2013splines, are one of the most commonly used\nfamily of piecewise polynomials. These polynomials, which are well adapted to numerical\ntasks, have been successfully used in many atomic\u2013physics studies. For example,\nJohnson and co\u2013workers have applied the B\u2013splines to the many\u2013body perturbation\ntheory [10, 11]. Froese Fischer and co-workers used it in (variational) Hartree\u2013Fock\ncalculations and continuum problems [12, 13]. Qiu and Froese Fischer introduced\nthe integration by cell algorithm for Slater integrals in a B\u2013spline basis obtaining an\nimproved efficiency and accuracy over traditional methods [14, 15]. Bhatti and co\u2013\nworkers [16] used similar techniques to find an approximate solution of a set of the non\u2013\nhomogeneous second\u2013order differential equations and to obtain static polarizabilities\nof hydrogenic states. Indelicato and co\u2013workers employed B\u2013splines in the multi\u2013\nconfiguration Dirac\u2013Fock (MCDF) relativistic atomic structure calculations [17, 18]\nand in relativistic two\u2013photon decay calculations [4, 19, 20].\nWhile B\u2013spline basis sets were proven to be an important tool for studying the\nvariety of atomic structure and dynamics problems (see Ref. [3, 21] for further details\nand examples), one might adopt other piecewise polynomial sets to speed up relativistic\nhigh-order calculations as might be highly required, for example, for studying the twophoton transitions in many-electron systems. In this work we argue that the Bernstein,\nor B\u2013polynomials [22] may serve as a good alternative to the B\u2013splines since they\nallow for analytical finite\u2013basis\u2013set calculations. These are polynomial functions of nth\ndegree that have been recently used to obtain the solution of some linear and non-linear\ndifferential equations [23, 24, 25]. Bhatti and Perger [26] developed an algorithm for\nconstructing accurate solutions to the radial Dirac equation in a B-polynomial basis\nset. By using this algorithm and the Galerkin method, accurate calculations have been\nperformed for the bound-state energies of hydrogenic systems.\n\n\fCalculation of the two\u2013photon decay rates of hydrogen\u2013like ions\n\n3\n\nIn this work, we employ the finite (discrete) solutions constructed from the B\u2013\npolynomial sets in order to explore two\u2013photon decay of hydrogen\u2013like ions. Theoretical\nanalysis of this process requires evaluation of the second\u2013order transition amplitudes\nand, hence, can be used as a \"testing ground\" for the high\u2013order B\u2013polynomial\ncalculations. To explain the background of these calculations we will recall in Sections\n2.2 and 2.3 the application of finite\u2013basis\u2013set methods for dealing with the Dirac\nproblem. In particular, we will derive the generalized eigenvalue problem whose solutions\nform a complete set of atomic pseudostates. In order to find these solutions, however,\none has to agree first about the explicit form of the basis functions. In Section 2.4, we\nwill introduce B\u2013polynomial basis sets, and discuss their properties. We will use these\nsets to construct the (pseudo) spectrum of the ion (or atom). Summation over such a\nspectrum, which appears within the second\u2013order perturbation theory, will be performed\nlater in Section 2.5 and will allow us to derive the two\u2013photon decay rates. Results of\nthe relativistic calculations for these rates obtained for the 2s1/2 \u2192 1s1/2 transition in\nneutral hydrogen and hydrogen\u2013like ions will be presented in Section 3. Apart from\nthe results obtained by making use of the B\u2013polynomial sets, we present here also the\n\"standard\" B\u2013spline calculations as well as the predictions by Labzowsky et al [27].\nDetailed comparison with these predictions will allow us to justify the application of\nthe B\u2013polynomial aproach in second\u2013order calculations and to underline its advantages.\nThe summary of our work will be given finally in Section 4.\nThe atomic system of units (e = me = ~ = 1) is used throughout the paper unless\notherwise stated.\n2. Theory\n2.1. General approach\nThe second\u2013order relativistic calculations in atomic and molecular physics often require\nsummation over the complete spectrum of the system under consideration. Such a\nsummation, that includes integration over the positive\u2013 as well as negative\u2013energy\ncontinua, can be performed very efficiently if one considers the (atomic or molecular)\nsystem to be enclosed in a finite cavity with a radius R. This allows for a discretization\nof the continua and, hence, for a representation of the entire Dirac spectrum in terms\nof the pseudostate basis functions. A (quasi\u2013complete) finite set of these functions are\ndetermined subsequently by making use of the variational Galerkin method [28].\n2.2. Finite basis set approach to the Dirac equation\nHaving briefly discussed the general context, we are ready now to apply the finite basis\nset method for solving the eigenvalue Dirac's problem\n\u0001\nc\u03b1 * p + \u03b2c2 + V (r) u(r) = \u03b5u(r) ,\n(1)\nwhere \u03b1 and \u03b2 are the usual 4 \u00d7 4 Dirac matrices, and V (r) describes Coulomb\ninteraction between an electron and nucleus. Moreover, in Eq. (1) we have replaced the\n\n\fCalculation of the two\u2013photon decay rates of hydrogen\u2013like ions\n\n4\n\ntotal electron energy E by \u03b5 = E \u2212 c2 to render easy the comparison with nonrelativistic\ncalculations.\nSince the potential V (r) is central, the eigenfunctions of the Dirac Hamiltonian can\nbe written in the standard form as\n\"\n#\n1\nPn\u03ba (r) \u03a9\u03bam (r\u0302)\n,\n(2)\nun\u03ba (r) =\nr iQn\u03ba (r) \u03a9\u2212\u03bam (r\u0302)\nwith \u03a9\u03bam (r\u0302) being the Dirac spin\u2013angular function. The angular quantum number \u03ba is\ndefined by\n(\n`\nif j = ` \u2212 1/2\n\u03ba=\n,\n(3)\n\u2212(` + 1)\nif j = ` + 1/2\nwhere ` and j are the electron orbital and total angular momenta, respectively. By\nsubstituting the wavefunction (2) into Eq. (1) and by performing some simple angular\nmomentum algebra one can obtain the conventional set of radial Dirac equations\n#\"\n#\n\"\n#\n\"\n\u03ba\nPn\u03ba (r)\nPn\u03ba (r)\nV (r)\nc O\u2212\n=\u03b5\n.\n(4)\n\u03ba\n\u22122me c2 + V (r)\nQn\u03ba (r)\nQn\u03ba (r)\n\u2212c O+\nto determine the large, Pn\u03ba (r), and the small, Qn\u03ba (r), radial components.

(4) we assume the ion (or atom) is enclosed\nin a finite cavity with a radius R large enough to get a good approximation of the\nwavefunctions, with some suitable set of boundary conditions. In order to construct\nthese functions, we shall turn to the principle of least action [10]\n\u03b4S\u03ba = 0 ,\n\n(6)\n\nfrom which the Dirac equation can be derived. In this expression, the action S\u03ba is\ndefined as\nZ\n1 R\b\n\u03ba\n\u03ba\nS\u03ba =\ncPn\u03ba (r)O\u2212\nQn\u03ba (r) \u2212 cQn\u03ba (r)O+\nPn\u03ba (r)\n2 0\n\u0002\n\u0003\n+ V (r) Pn\u03ba (r)2 + Qn\u03ba (r)2 \u22122me c2 Qn\u03ba (r)2 dr\nZ R\n\u0002\n\u0003\n1\n\u2212 \u000f\nPn\u03ba (r)2 + Qn\u03ba (r)2 dr + S\u03babond ,\n(7)\n2\n0\nwhere the upper integration limit R is the radius of the confining cavity.

The explicit form of these functions is not crucial for\nthe following discussion and will be specified later in Section 2.4.2. In Eq. (9), moreover,\nthe subscripts n and \u03ba have been omitted from the functions Pn\u03ba (r) and Qn\u03ba (r) for the\nsake of notation simplicity.\nBy inserting now the radial components (9) into the least action principle (6) and\nby evaluating the variation S\u03ba with respect to change of expansion coefficients pi and\nqi , we obtain the matrix equation\nAv = \u000fBv,\n\n(10)\n\nto determine the vector v = (p1 , p2 , . . . , pN , q1 , q2 , . . . , qN ) and where A and B are\nsymmetric 2N \u00d7 2N matrices given, respectively, by\nh\n\u0010 \u03ba \u0011i \uf8f9\n\uf8ee\n(V )\nc (D) \u2212\nr\n\uf8fb + Abond\nh\n\u0010 \u03ba \u0011i\n(11)\nA=\uf8f0\n\u22122me c2 (C) + (V )\n\u2212c (D) +\nr\nand\n#\n\"\n(C) 0\nB=\n.\n(12)\n0 (C)\nThe matrix Abond reflects the boundary conditions, and the N \u00d7 N matrices (C), (D),\n(V ) and (\u03ba/r) are given by\nZ\n(C)ij = Bi (r)Bj (r)dr,\n(13)\nZ\n(D)ij =\nZ\n\n\u0010\u03ba\u0011\nr\n\nd\nBj (r)dr,\ndr\n\n(14)\n\n\u03ba\nBi (r) Bj (r)dr.\nr\n\n(15)\n\nBi (r)V (r)Bj (r)dr .\n\n(16)\n\nBi (r)\n\n=\nij\n\nZ\n(V )ij =\n\nEquation (10) is known as a generalized eigenvalue problem that can be solved by\nemploying linear algebra standard techniques.

Spurious states and boundary conditions\nThe practical implementation of the finite basis set approaches is usually complicated\nby the well\u2013known problem of spurious states. These non\u2013physical states appear as\nsolutions of the single\u2013particle radial Dirac equation for \u03ba > 0 (p1/2 , d3/2 , . . . orbitals)\n[30]. Although the spurious solutions \"spoil\" the spectrum of the ion (or atom) under\nconsideration, they are required for providing completeness of the basis set. The problem\nof spurious states has been discussed in detail in the literature, and several solutions\nwere proposed [30, 31, 32, 33, 34]. Johnson an co\u2013workers [10], in their pioneering\napplications of the B\u2013splines to the relativistic many\u2013body problem, have suggested to\nadopt the function S\u03baBond in Eq. (7) as\n\uf8f1\nc\n\uf8f4\n[P 2 (R) \u2212 Q2 (R)] \u2212 2c P (0) [P (0) \u2212 Q(0)]\n\uf8f4\n4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\nfor \u03ba < 0\n,\n(17)\nS\u03baBond =\nc\nc\n2\n2\n\uf8f4\n[P (R) \u2212 Q (R)] \u2212 2 P (0) [cP (0) \u2212 Q(0)]\n\uf8f4\n4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\nfor \u03ba > 0\nin order to lift the spurious states to lower energies (to the negative continumm), thus\nrestoring the low\u2013energy mapping to the physical solutions. For variations of P (r) and\nQ(r) the boundary terms vanish if\nP (0) = 0\n\nand\n\nP (R) = Q(R).\n\n(18)\n\nThe latter boundary condition at the outer boundary r = R is the MIT\u2013bag-model\ncondition [35], and was included to avoid problems with Klein's paradox that arises\nwhen one attempts to confine a particle into a cavity, essentially by forcing the radial\ncurrent crossing the boundary to vanish [36].\n2.4. Finite-basis expansion\n2.4.1. B-polynomials expansion As seen from Eqs. (10)\u2013(16), any further analysis of\nthe generalized eigenvalue problem requires the knowledge on the the explicit form of\nthe basis functions Bi (r). In the present work we will construct these functions from\nthe B-polynomial as well as B\u2013spline spline sets. While the latter case will be discussed\nin Subsection 2.4.2, here we shall recall the main features of B\u2013polynomials, also known\nas Bernstein functions.\nThe B\u2013polynomials of kth\u2013order are defined by [22, 23, 24]\n!\n(r \u2212 a)i (b \u2212 r)k\u2212i\nk\nBi,k (r) =\n, i = 0, 1, . . . , k ,\n(19)\ni\n(b \u2212 a)k\nwhere the standard form of the binomial coefficients are utilized,\n!\nk!\nk\n=\n,\ni\ni!(n \u2212 i)!\n\n(20)\n\nand where a and b denote the limits of the interval [a, b] over which the polynomials are\ndefined to form a complete basis. Since the atomic system is defined in a finite cavity\nof radius R, we take a = 0 and b = R.\n\n\fCalculation of the two\u2013photon decay rates of hydrogen\u2013like ions\n\n7\n\nAs seen from definition (19), there are are (k + 1) polynomials of degree k. By\ndefinition, we set Bi,k (r) = 0 if i < 0 and i > k. As an example, a set of 11 B\u2013\npolynomials of degree 10 is plotted in Fig. 1 where where it is shown that each Bpolynomial is positive and the sum of all B-polynomials is unity.\nThe great advantage of B\u2013polynomials is that they allow for an analytical evaluation\nof the matrices (C), (D) and (\u03ba/r) in the generalized eigenvalue problem (10). That is,\nby inserting Bi = Bi,k (r) into Eqs. (13)-(15), we obtain\n!\n!\n1\nk\nk\n!,\n(21)\n(C)ij = R\ni\nj\n2k\n(2k + 1)\ni+j\n!\n!\n(j \u2212 i)\nk\nk\n!,\n(D)ij =\n(22)\ni\nj\n2k \u2212 1\n2(i + j)\ni+j\n!\n!\n\u0010\u03ba\u0011\n1\nk\nk\n!\n(23)\n=\u03ba\ni\nj\nr ij\n2k\n(i + j)\n.\ni+j\nApart from the basis functions Bi,k (r), the knowledge on the nuclear charge distribution\nis also required for an evaluation of the matrix (V ) whose elements are defined by\nEq. (16). For the point\u2013like nucleus potential, V p (r) = \u2212Z/r, for example, these\nmatrix elements read as\n!\n!\n1\nk\nk\n!.\n(V p )ij = \u2212Z\n(24)\ni\nj\n2k\n(i + j)\ni+j\nA more complicated expression for the matrix (V ) is obtained to account for the finite\nnuclear size effects. To address these effects, we employ here the potential\n\u0014\u0010 \u0011\n\u0015\n\uf8f1\n2\n\uf8f2 Z\nr\n\u22123 ,\nr \u2264 rN\n2rN\nrN\nV U (r) =\n,\n(25)\n\uf8f3 Z\n\u2212r,\nr > rN\ndue to a uniform spherical nuclear charge distribution with radius rN . By employing\nthis potential in Eq.

B-splines expansion Since the B-spline basis set approach has been discussed\nin detail elsewhere [8, 10], here we will restrict ourselves to a very brief compilation of\nits basic expressions. Following de Boor [9], we divide the interval of interest [0, R] into\nsegments whose endpoints define a knot sequence {ti } = 1, 2, . . . , n + k. The B\u2013splines\nof the order k, Bi,k (r), are defined on this knot sequence by the recurrence relation\nr \u2212 ti\nti+k \u2212 r\nBi,k\u22121 (r) +\nBi+1,k\u22121 (r) ,\n(27)\nBi,k (r) =\nti+k\u22121 \u2212 ti\nti+k \u2212 ti+1\nwhere the B\u2013splines of the first order read as\n(\n1,\nti \u2264 r \u2264 ti+1\nBi,1 (r) =\n.\n(28)\n0,\notherwise\nNote, that in these expressions the number of knots ti is by k larger than the\nnumber of splines. The first and the last k knots must be equal and are defined as:\nt1 = t2 = . . . = tk = 0 and tn+1 = tn+2 = . . . = tn+k = R.\n2.5. Two\u2013photon decay rates\nIn the previous Sections we have obtained the finite (discrete) basis solutions of the Dirac\neigenproblem (1) constructed from the B\u2013polynomial as well as B\u2013spline sets. Now we\nare ready to apply these solutions for studying the two\u2013photon transitions in hydrogen\u2013\nlike ions. Not much has to be said about the theoretical background for describing\nsuch a second\u2013order process. In the past, relativistic calculations of both, the total\nand the differential two\u2013photon decay rates have been discussed in detail elsewhere\n[4, 19, 20, 37]. Below, therefore, we will repeat just basic expressions, relevant for\ndiscussing the role of the finite basis\u2013sets in the two\u2013photon calculations.\nUsually, the properties of the two\u2013photon atomic transitions are evaluated within\nthe framework of the second\u2013order perturbation theory. This theory provides the\nfollowing expression for the differential in energy decay rate [38],\n\u0012\n\u00132\ndw\n\u03c91 \u03c92 X hf |A\u22172 | \u03bdi h\u03bd |A\u22171 | ii\nhf |A\u22171 | \u03bdi h\u03bd |A\u22172 | ii\n=\n+\nd\u03a91 d\u03a92 ,\n(29)\nd\u03c91\n(2\u03c0)3 c2 \u03bd\nE\u03bd \u2212 Ei + \u03c91\nE\u03bd \u2212 Ei + \u03c92\nwhere \u03c9j is the frequency and d\u03a9j is the element of solid angle of the j th photon. In this\nexpression, moreover, |ii \u2261 |ni ji \u03bci i, |\u03bdi \u2261 |(\u000f\u03bd )n\u03bd j\u03bd \u03bc\u03bd i |f i \u2261 |nf jf \u03bcf i denote solutions\nof the Diracs equation for the initial, intermediate and final ionic states respectively,\nwhile Ei , E\u03bd and Ef are the corresponding one\u2013particle energies. Because of energy\nconservation, Ei and Ef are related to the energies \u03c91,2 of the emitted photons by\nEf \u2212 Ei = \u03c91 + \u03c92 = \u03c9t .\n\n(30)\n\nFor a photon plane-wave with propagation vector kj and polarization vector \u00eaj\n(\u00eaj * kj =0), the operators A\u2217j in Eq. (29) are given by\n\u0010\n\u0011\nA\u2217j = \u03b1 * \u00eaj + Gk\u0302j e\u2212ikj *r \u2212 Ge\u2212ikj *r\n(31)\n\n\fCalculation of the two\u2013photon decay rates of hydrogen\u2013like ions\n\n9\n\nwhere \u03b1 is the vector of Dirac matrices and G is an arbitrary gauge parameter. Among\nthe large variety of possible gauges, Grant [39] showed that there are two values\nof G which are of particular utility because they lead to well\u2013known nonrelativistic\noperators. If G = 0, one has the so\u2013called Coulomb gauge, or velocity gauge, which\nleads to the dipole velocity form in the nonrelativistic limit. If G = [(L + 1) /L]1/2 , for\n\u221a\nexample, G = 2 for E1 transitions (L = 1), one obtains a nonrelativistic expression\nwhich reduces to the dipole length form of the transition operator. From the general\nrequirement of gauge invariance the final results must be independent of G. The gauge\ninvariance of the two\u2013photon relativistic calculations was studied by Goldman and Drake\n[37] and by Santos et al [4].\nSo far, we have discussed the general expressions for the two\u2013photon transition\nrates that are differential in the energy \u03c91 of one of the photons. By performing an\nintegration over this energy one may easily obtain the total rate\nZ\u03c9t\ndw\nd\u03c91 ,\n(32)\nwtot =\nd\u03c91\n0\n\nwhich is directly related to the lifetime of a particular excited state against the two\u2013\nphoton decay. In this expression, we introduce the transition energy as \u03c9t = \u03c91 + \u03c92 .\nThe evaluation of the matrix elements f A\u2217j \u03bd and \u03bd A\u2217j i and, hence, of the\ndifferential (29) as well as total (32) rates involves the radial integrals [40]\nZ \u221e\n\u0010 \u03c9r \u0011\n\u00b1\nIL (\u03c9) =\n[Pf (r)Qi (r) \u00b1 Qf (r)Pi (r)] jL\ndr,\n(33)\nc\n0\nand\nZ \u221e\n\u0010 \u03c9r \u0011\ndr,\n(34)\nJL (\u03c9) =\n[Pf (r)Pi (r) + Qf (r)Qi (r)] jL\nc\n0\nwhere jL (x) is the spherical Bessel function of the first kind [41]. By making use of a a\nfinite piecewise polynomials basis\u2013set to describe the large and small radial components\nof the Dirac wavefunctions [cf. Eq. (9)], both, IL\u00b1 (\u03c9) and JL (\u03c9) can be reduced to a\nlinear combination of the integrals\nZ \u221e\nn X\nn\n\u0010 \u03c9r \u0011\nX\nL,S\nL,S\nF (r)F (r)jL\ndr =\nfiL,S fjL,S (jL )ij .\n(35)\nc\n0\ni=1 j=1\nHere, for the sake of shortness, we denote F L (r) = P (r) and F S (r) = Q(r) as well as\nfiL = pi and fiS = qi , and the matrix elements (jL )ij are defined by\nZ \u221e\n\u0010 \u03c9r \u0011\n(jL )ij =\nBi (r)Bj (r)jL\ndr .\n(36)\nc\n0\nThese radial matrix elements are the \"building blocks\" used to evaluate two\u2013photon\ndecay rates. An efficient and fast evaluation of these matrix elements is crucial for\nstudying transitions not only in hydrogen\u2013like but also in many\u2013electron ions.

Results and discussion\n3.1. Determination of the optimal set of parameters\nHaving discussed the application of the finite basis solutions constructed from the B\u2013\nspline and B\u2013polynomials sets for the two\u2013photon relativistic studies, we will employ\nnow these solutions to analyze the properties of the 2s1/2 \u2192 1s1/2 transition in the\nhydrogen\u2013like ions. Before we start an analysis, however, we must find the optimal set\nof parameters, such as the number of the basis functions or the size R of the cavity\nradius, to be used in these calculations.\nTo determine the optimal set for the B-polynomial approach, we consider first the\ntransition energy \u03c9t [Eq. (30)]. Accurate computation of this energy is crucial since\nboth the differential [Eq. (29)] and total [Eq. (32)] decay rates depend quadratically\non it. Detailed calculations of this energy value were carried out by making use of\nB\u2013polynomial basis sets for various numbers of polynomials, nBP , and of the cavity\nradius, R. For the particular case of the point\u2013like nucleus, results of our B\u2013polynomial\ncalculations have been compared against the predictions of the well\u2013known expression\nfor the Dirac bound-state energies (see, e.g., Ref. [42])\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f9\u22121/2\n\u03b5Exact\nn\n\n\uf8ef\n\uf8ef\n= c \uf8ef1 + \u0014\n\uf8f0\n2\n\n\uf8fa\n(Z\u03b1)2\n\uf8fa\n\u0015\nq\n2\uf8fa\n\uf8fb\nn \u2212 |\u03ba| + \u03ba2 \u2212 (Z\u03b1)2\n\n\u2212 c2 ,\n\n(39)\n\nwhere n is the principal quantum number and \u03ba is the angular quantum momentum of\nelectron [cf. Eq. (3)].\nApart from the energy values \u03b5BP\nn , evaluation of two\u2013photon transition rates (29)\nand (32) requires also detailed knowledge of the atomic wavefunctions. As usual in\natomic structure calculations, an indication for the completeness and quality of the basis\n\n\fCalculation of the two\u2013photon decay rates of hydrogen\u2013like ions\n\n11\n\nset can be obtained from the comparison of the results obtained within two different\ngauges [cf. Eq. (31)]. In this way, detailed calculations of the total decay rates for the\nleading two-photon 2E1 2s1/2 \u2192 1s1/2 channel have been performed, in both length\nand velocity gauges. The gauge invariance condition together with the the energy \u03c9t\naccuracy determine the optimal set of parameters.\nThe relative difference \u2206\u03c9t = |(\u03c9tExact \u2212 \u03c9tBP )/\u03c9tExact | between the exact \u03c9tExact\nsolution and the basis set value \u03c9tBP is presented in Fig. 2 as a function of nBP for\nZ equal to 1, 40 and 92. We display in Fig. 3 the relative difference between the length\nand velocity gauge decay rate values of the 2E1 2s1/2 \u2192 1s1/2 , \u2206l\u2212v , as function of the\nnumber of B-Polynomials, nBP , for the same values of the atomic number Z.\nAs seen from Figs. 2 and 3, the optimal nBP value for Z = 1 is greater than 34\nand the optimal R is 50. For Z = 40 the parameters are nBP > 40 and R = 1, and for\nZ = 92 are nBP > 40 and R = 0.25.\nWorking in double precision, we noticed a loss of numerical significance in the\nresults for nBP > 23 due to the LAPACK 3.3.0 routines used for the solution of the\ngeneralized eigenvalue problem. We detected that this is due to the difficulty of these\nroutines, namely the DSYGVX routine, to deal with diagonally dominant matrices that\nhave very large diagonal elements and very small off diagonal elements. This problem\nwas overcome by using quadruple precision for the evaluation of the matrix elements and\ncompiling the LAPACK subroutine in quadruple precision as well, using the compiler\nauto-doubling option. This situation is illustrated in Fig. 4, where it is plotted the\nrelative difference \u2206l\u2212v for Z = 1 and R = 40, obtained in double and quadruple\nprecision.\nNevertheless, we should emphasize that even with a low nBP value, such as 20, and\nworking in double precision, we get a gauge invariance in the two-photon rate less than\n10\u221216 .\nBefore turning to the second\u2013order relativistic calculations performed within the\nfinite\u2013basis\u2013set approaches, let us recall that apart from the B\u2013polynomials, we used\nalso the \"standard\" B\u2013spline solutions. For these solutions, we adopted the following\nparameters described in Ref. [19]: k = 9, nBS = 60, and R = 60 a.u. Moreover, the\nintegration over the photon frequency in Eq. (32) has been performed using a 15\u2013point\nGauss\u2013Legendre algorithm.\n3.2. Second\u2013order relativistic calculations\nThe \"optimal\" sets of parameters for both, the B\u2013spline and B\u2013polynomial approaches,\ndetermined in the previous section will be used below for the computation of the two\u2013\nphoton transition rates in quadruple precision. However, first let us briefly return to the\nenergy calculations performed in these two approaches. In Table 1 we report the relative\ndifferences between the computed energies of ns1/2 states of neutral hydrogen and the\nB\u2212splines\nB\u2212Pol\ncorresponding exact values \u03b5Exact\ndefined by Eq. (39). Here, \u2206ETW\nand \u2206ETW\nn\nrepresent the differences obtained by employing the B\u2013polynomial and B\u2013spline sets,\n\n\fCalculation of the two\u2013photon decay rates of hydrogen\u2013like ions\n\n12\n\nB\u2212Pol\ncorrespondingly. Moreover, \u2206EBP\ndenotes the relative difference calculated with the\nB\u2013polynomial values by Bhatti and Perger [24]. The B\u2013polynomial relative differences\nare very similar with the B\u2013Spline relative differences, for n > 2. For n = 1, 2, the\nformer method achieved an excellent 12 digits agreement with the exact result, two\norders of magnitude better than the B-Splines.\nIn Table 2 we display the most significant multipole contributions to the 2s1/2 \u2192\n1s1/2 two\u2013photon total decay rate [Eq. (32)] of neutral hydrogen. Again, calculations\nhave been performed within two different gauges and by employing B\u2013polynomial as\nwell as B\u2013spline basis sets. Multipoles with only magnetic components such as 2M 1\nonly have velocity gauge. As seen in this Table, both approaches yield almost identical\nresults (with the relative error of less than 2 \u00d7 10\u22127 ) for all multipole decay channels.\nFurthermore, one may observe a remarkable agreement (smaller than 10\u221225 ) between\nthe values obtained in the length and velocity gauges for both basis sets.\nIt should be emphasized that with the B-Polynomials approach, that employs\nanalytical evaluation of the second\u2013order matrix elements [cf. Eqs. (33)\u2013 (37)] and\nuses a smaller optimal nBP , the computation time required for the determination of\neach multipole contribution is, in quadruple precision, about two and half times smaller\nthan the time required by the B\u2013Splines methods. These results clearly indicate that\nthe finite\u2013basis\u2013set approach based on B\u2013polynomial solutions provides an alternative\ntool for studying the two\u2013photon transitions.\nBesides the neutral hydrogen, extensive test of the B\u2013polynomial approach has been\nperformed also for the two\u2013photon transitions in medium\u2013 and high\u2013Z hydrogen\u2013like\nions. In Table 3 we display, for example, the total rates of the leading, 2E1 2s1/2 \u2192 1s1/2\nchannel for selected values of the nuclear charge Z. Here we used both, B\u2013spline and B\u2013\npolynomial approaches to carry out the intermediate\u2013state summation in Eq. (29) over\nthe complete Dirac's spectrum (W T ) as well as over the positive\u2013 (W + ) and negative\u2013\nenergy (W \u2212 ) solutions only. The role of Dirac's continua in relativistic second\u2013order\ncalculations has been the subject of recent theoretical investigations [20, 27] partially\nbecause of their impact on (future) many\u2013body studies. As seen from Table 3 , the\ngood agreement between the predictions obtained within the B\u2013polynomial and B\u2013spline\napproaches can be found for the ions along the entire isoelectronic sequence. Moreover,\nboth our calculations show a perfect agreement between gauges, which is better than\nthe one reported by Labzowsky et al [27].\nAgain, the presented calculations validate the B\u2013Polynomial basis set as a useful\nand appropriate basis set to study two\u2013photon decays in atomic systems, and various\natomic calculations that involve a summation over the Dirac spectrum.\n\n4. Conclusions\nIn the present work we have investigated, for the first time, the efficiency and accuracy\nof the B\u2013Polynomial basis set for studying the two\u2013photon transitions in hydrogen\u2013\nlike systems. Based on the finite\u2013basis\u2013set approach, the generalized eigenproblem in\n\n\fCalculation of the two\u2013photon decay rates of hydrogen\u2013like ions\n\n13\n\nEq. (10) was solved in order to provide the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions, which were\nsuccessfully used for the calculations of the two\u2013photon decay rates. We took advantage\nof the B\u2013Polynomial properties and derived fully relativistic analytical expressions for\nthe two\u2013photon rates both, within the pointlike\u2013 and finite\u2013nucleus models, instead of\nemploying numerical methods.\nIn order to illustrate the application of the B\u2013polynomial method and to verify its\naccuracy, we have performed detailed calculations of the total rates for the 2s1/2 \u2192 1s1/2\ntwo\u2013photon transition in neutral hydrogen and hydrogen\u2013like ions. Results of these\ncalculations have been compared with the predictions of the well\u2013established B\u2013spline\napproach. While the perfect agreement between the results of both, B\u2013spline and B\u2013\npolynomial approximations was observed along the entire isoelectronic sequence, the\nB\u2013polynomial calculations were found to be much less computationally demanding.\nIt was noticed that if we consider a basis set with more than 23 B-Polynomials,\nwe need to work in quadruple precision due to the LAPACK 3.3.0 routines limitation\nin dealing with matrices that have very large diagonal matrix elements and very small\noff-diagonal values.\nWe conclude that the B\u2013Polynomial basis sets are suitable for investigation of the\ntwo\u2013photon transitions with the great advantage of enabling analytical expressions for\nthe involved integrals, which speed up the calculations.\nThe presented procedure may be easily extended to calculate two\u2013photon\ntransitions in many\u2013electron ions or atoms, as well as to the quantum electrodynamics\n(QED) calculations that usually require the summation over the complete Dirac\nspectrum.\nAcknowledgments\nThis research was supported in part by FCT, by the French-Portuguese collaboration\n(PESSOA Program, Contract no 441.00), by the Ac\u00e7\u00f5es Integradas Luso-Francesas\n(Contract no F-11/09) and by the Programme Hubert Curien and Ac\u00e7\u00f5es Integradas\nLuso-Alem\u00e3s (Contract no 20022VB and A-19/09).
