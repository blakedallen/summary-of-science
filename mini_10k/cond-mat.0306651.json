The wide variety of phenomena that are\nobserved in transition metal (TM) oxides is caused by\nthe interplay of various degrees of freedom. An intrinsic\nproperty of doped TM oxides is the formation of superstructures that are related to the charge, spin, lattice and\norbital degrees of freedom. Different types of charge ordering (CO), orbital ordering and magnetic ordering may\nexist depending on e.g. doping concentration, temperature and pressure. Charge order is usually considered\nto be an ordering of TM ions with different valence, for\ninstance the alternation of Mn3+/4+ in La0.5 Ca0.5 MnO3\nor Fe2+/3+ in Fe3 O4 . Such a CO state we refer to as\na site-centered (or TM-centered) CO, or equivalently, a\nsite-centered charge density wave (SCDW). There is however another possibility for charge ordering -the formation of a bond-centered charge density wave (BCDW).\nThe BCDW is very similar to the state that is observed\nin Peierls distorted quasi one-dimensional materials. In\na TM oxide the BCDW is actually an oxygen-centered\ncharge ordered state as oxygen ions are located on the\nTM-TM bonds in the typical (e.g. perovskite) crystal\nstructures of these systems. The possibility to have such\nan oxygen-centered BCDW was studied theoretically for\nthe compounds RNiO3 (with R =Pr, Nd, etc.) [1].\nFor about the last 50 years it was presumed that in\nmanganites of the type R1\u2212x Cax MnO3 (with R = La,\nPr, etc.) only the Mn-centered SCDW occurs. At e.g.\nx = 1/2 this SCDW state has the well-known orbital\nordered CE-type magnetic structure, see Fig.1a, an ordering for which there is abundant experimental and\ntheoretical support [2, 3]. However, Daoud-Aladine et\nal. challenge this canonical picture in their recent study\n[4]. These authors conclude that in single crystalline\nPr0.6 Ca0.4 MnO3 another type of superstructure is more\nconsistent with the experimental data. This superstructure is a BCDW, which they refer to as the Zener polaron\nstate (Fig.1b). This state is made out of dimers in which\nall Mn ions have the same valence (all Mn3+x ), quite\ndifferent from the canonical SCDW that holds Mn ions\nwith unequal valence. Recently the BCDW state was\n\nC\n\nA\n\nB\nA'\n\nC'\nD\n\nD'\n\nFIG. 1: Three types of magnetic/orbital superstructures: a)\nCE phase; b) Orthogonal (\u22a5) phase; c) 120\u25e6 - phase. Directions of spins are shown by arrows.\n\nalso found theoretically in Hartee-Fock calculations of\nthe electronic structure [5, 6]. The presence of a BCDW\namounts to a drastic change in our understanding of\ncharge ordering -not only for manganites. It may imply\nthat in all cases of charge order in oxides one should have\nin mind, besides the usual site-centered CO, alternative\nstates with bond-centered superstructures.\nIn this paper we consider the regions of stability of different superstructures in doped manganites close to halfdoping, and show that indeed the bond-centered charge\ndensity wave (Zener polaron) state may be favorable in\npart of the phase diagram. Our results reconcile the conflicting conclusions of Refs. [2] and [4]: the conventional\nCE state is still better at exactly half-doping x = 1/2, but\na BCDW is stable at around x \u223c 0.4, as observed experimentally. The most interesting result of our calculation\nis the following: in a large part of the phase diagram an\nintermediate state actually turns out to be most favorable. This state is a superposition of a BCDW (Zener\npolaron) and a SCDW (of CE-type). As one can easily\nsee, a superposition of Figs.1a and 1b results in a state\nin which the two Mn ions in one dimer are inequivalent.\nThis produces a dipole moment on each pair, and the\nresulting state is therefore ferroelectric. The appearance\nof ferroelectricity in the case of coexistence of a bondcentered CDW (Peierls state) and the site-centered CDW\nwas previously observed in some quasi one-dimensional\ncompounds [7]. But, to the best of our knowledge, such\n\n\f2\na state was never discussed in the context of the threedimensional TM oxides. In this respect it is noteworthy\nthat first measurements of the dielectric constant in these\nmanganites show a strong anomaly at the CO phase transition, which might be related to ferroelectricity [8].\nQualitative considerations. It is well established that\ncharge and orbital structures are closely related to the\nmagnetic ordering [9]. In all the papers where either the\nusual SCDW [2] or the BCDW (Zener polarons) [4] are\nconsidered, the magnetic structure is taken to be of the\nCE type (ferromagnetic zig-zag chains stacked antiferromagnetically, Fig.1a). However in the BCDW picture the\nsituation can change drastically due to orbital ordering\nexisting in the structure of Fig.1b (predominantly dx2 orbitals on horizontal dimers and dy2 on vertical ones, see\nbelow). Due to the double exchange mechanism the coupling between spins inside a Zener polaron is definitely\nstrongly ferromagnetic. The high-spin polaron dimers -\nif we treat them as localized spins- form a triangular\nlattice, see Fig.1c, with a relatively strong antiferromagnetic coupling between neighboring parallel dimers. A\ndifferent magnetic coupling can be expected when the\ndimers are are oriented perpendicular to each other. If\nthese couplings would all be comparable in magnitude\nand antiferromagnetic, then the angle between neighboring high spin polarons on the triangular lattice would\nbe 120\u25e6 and a tripartite Jaffet-Kittel magnetic structure\nwould be formed, Fig.1c. However from the orbital structure of Zener polaron described above one can immediately conclude that the perpendicular coupling is definitely weaker. We therefore expect that the magnetic\nstructure tends to an \"orthogonal\" (\u22a5) ordered state\nwith four different spin sublattices as shown in Fig.1b.\nWe should mention that the neutron scattering data for\nPr0.6 Ca0.4 MnO3 can be equally well described both by\nthe conventional magnetic structure of Fig.1a and by\nthe orthogonal structure of Fig.1b [10] that we propose\nhere. In the overdoped manganites R1\u2212x Cax MnO3 , with\nx = 2/3, 3/4 a \u22a5 magnetic structure was already observed [11].\nCalculated phase diagram. In our calculations we use\na tight binding approach for the band structure of the\nmanganites, where both double exchange and superexchange are incorporated. This approach proved to be\nquite efficient for overdoped (x > 0.5) [12] and halfdoped [13] manganites. In the double-exchange framework with strong on-site Hund's rule coupling the motion of eg -electrons is largely determined by the underlying magnetic structure. In this approach the stability of\nvarious magnetic and orbital structures is determined by\nthe competition of the band energy of the eg -electrons,\nfavoring ferromagnetism, and superexchange interaction\nJ between localized (t2g ) spins, favoring antiferromagnetism. The double degeneracy of conduction electrons\nsignificantly modifies the conventional picture and leads\nto the stabilization of more complicated magnetic struc-\n\nFIG. 2: Phase diagram of manganites for doping concentrations close to 1/2.

The electron density is\nnel = 1 \u2212 x.\n\ntures, besides the simple ferromagnetic (F) or antiferromagnetic (G) ones [12]. We calculate the groundstate\nenergy for different magnetic structures: G-, C- and Aand CE-type antiferromagnetic states, the ferromagnetic\n(F) phase, and, in addition, for two new phases (with\northogonal (\u22a5) and 120\u25e6 Jaffet-Kittel type magnetic ordering of spin dimers) that we expect to be relevant close\nto x \u223c 1/2, based on the arguments above.\nThe effective hopping matrix elements t\u03b1\u03b2\nij depend on\nthe type of the orbitals \u03b1, \u03b2 and relative orientation of\n2\nx2 \u2212y 2 , x2 \u2212y 2\n, z2\na pair i, j, so that ti,jkx\n= 3/4t, tzi,jkz\n= t and\n2\n\n2\n\n,z\ntzijkx\n= 1/4t [14]. Besides this, there is the usual dependence of hopping on the angle \u03b8 between neighboring\n\u03b1,\u03b2\nspins: t\u0303\u03b1,\u03b2\ni,j = tij cos \u03b8ij /2. The antiferromagnetic superexchange energy per bond is J cos \u03b8ij . With these\nexpressions it is straightforward to calculate the band\ndispersion and total energy of different phases, cf. [12].\nIn Fig.2. we show the resulting phase diagram as a function of doping x and antiferromagnetic coupling J. For\nx >\n\u223c 1/2 we find mainly the magnetic CE, C, A and F\nphase to be stable, in accordance with previous results\n[12, 15]. For x <\n\u223c 0.5 we also find a large region where the\nBCDW magnetic 120\u25e6 state is stable. Most interestingly,\nwe also find a finite region of the \u22a5 phase. This phase\nis stable for doping concentration from around x \u223c 0.4,\nwhich agrees with the fact that at this concentration the\nZener polaron state was found [4].\nFrom the calculation we know the corresponding wave\nfunctions so we can find the orbital occupation on a certain site by projecting the wave function on that particular site. In agreement with the standard picture we\nobtain that for the CE-structure the edge sites A, A' in\nFig.1a. are occupied by orbitals dx2 and dy2 , respectively.\nOn the corner sites predominantly the dx2 \u2212y2 orbital is\noccupied with about 10 % admixture of dz2 density.\nLet us denote the general orbital state as |\u03c6i =\ncos \u03c6/2|z 2 i + sin \u03c6/2|x2 \u2212 y 2 i. For an isolated dimer that\n\n\f3\npoints along the x direction (the equivalent D, D' sites\nin Fig.1.b) we then expect \u03c6 = 2\u03c0/3 for both sites in\nthe dimer, which corresponds to occupied dx2 orbitals on\nboth sites. For an isolated dimer along the y direction\n(C, C' sites in Fig.1.b.) we then expect \u03c6 = \u22122\u03c0/3,\ncorresponding to occupied dy2 orbitals. From the calculation of the wave functions for the \u22a5 phase, where\nthere is an interaction between neighboring dimers, we\nfind for the x-dimer that \u03c6 \u223c 130\u25e6 , which is mainly a\ndx2 -state, as we had for a non-interaction dimer, but\nwith some admixture of dx2 \u2212y2 . Correspondingly, for the\ny-dimers we find \u03c6 \u223c \u2212130\u25e6 , which amounts to a predominantly dy2 -state with some dx2 \u2212y2 character. This\nadmixture is important as it is driving the stability of\nthe \u22a5 phase. The superexchange tends to align the spins\nof neighboring x-and y-dimers antiparallel. But in the \u22a5\nphase these spins are only orthogonal, so that the hopping between the\n\u221a dimers is possible, although reduced\nby a factor 1/ 2 from its maximum value. From this\nhopping between neighboring dimers, which leads to the\nadmixture of dx2 \u2212y2 states into the groundstate wavefunction, the system gains kinetic energy. Note that the\nhopping amplitude between dx2 orbitals of neighboring xdimers (or between dy2 orbitals of neighboring y-dimers,\nrespectively) is much smaller, so that the spins of neighboring dimers of the same kind tend to align themselves\nfully antiparallel. Thus we conclude that the stability\nof the \u22a5 state is caused by its orbital order that allows\nfor an optimal compromise between electron delocalization, causing ferromagnetic double exchange, and antiferromagnetic superexchange interactions.\nCharge ordering and ferroelectricity. In the CE-phase\nthe edge and the corner sites are crystalographically inequivalent. This results in different total electron occupation numbers on edge and corner sites. Already\nwhen the on-site Coulomb interaction U between electrons in different orbitals but on the same site is included,\nthe common picture of a checkerboard SCDW arises in\nthis system, with a valence Mn3.5+\u2206q of the corner sites,\nMn3.5\u2212\u2206q of the edge sites and \u2206q \u2264 0.1 [13]. The CEstructure has a center of inversion symmetry and, consequently, there are no electrical dipoles moments present\nin the groundstate. This is also the case in the pure\n\u22a5 structure as both Mn ions in each dimer are equivalent [16]. But there may exist an intermediate state\nthat does have dipole moments: this intermediate state\nis a superposition of the CE and \u22a5 phase. This state\nhas a magnetic structure in which the spins of x-dimers\n(spins within each dimer are ferromagnetic) are antiparallel to one another, and the y-dimers, also antiparallel\nbetween themselves, are rotated with a certain angle \u03b8\nwith respect to the x-dimers. The angle \u03b8 characterizes\nintermediate phase as it determines the amount of mixing between CE and \u22a5 that is present in the groundstate:\n\u03b8 = 0 corresponds to the CE-structure, while \u03b8 = \u03c0/2\ncorresponds to the \u22a5 one.\n\nq\n\nDq\n0.08\n\np/2\n\n0.06\n0.04\n0.02\n\n0\n0.4\n\n0.45\n\n0.5\n\nFIG. 3: Charge disproportionation \u2206q and mixing angle \u03c6\n(see text) for the U = t in Hartree-Fock approximation in the\nintermediate \u22a5 and CE phases.\n\nWe find that the region of stability of this intermediate\nphase is larger than that of a pure \u22a5-phase, and extends\nfrom the concentrations x \u223c 0.4 to x = 0.5; Fig.2 shows\nfor which values of x and J/t this mixed intermediate\nphase is stable. The angle \u03b8 = 0 for x = 1/2, and it\nincreases with decreasing x, reaching the value \u03b8 = \u03c0/2\n(\u22a5 phase) at x \u223c 0.4, see Fig.3. The intermediate phase\nis therefore in general a superposition of the CE and \u22a5\nphase, except near the phase boundaries in Fig.2. where\nthe pure phases are stable. In the intermediate phase\nthere exist simultaneously a dimer (Zener polaron) bondcentered CDW and a checkerboard site-centered CDW.\nThis implies that in the intermediate state the valence of\nthe two Mn's in a dimer is different, inversion symmetry\nis broken and each dimer attains a dipole moment. In\nthis phase the dipole moments of the x-dimers point e.g.\nto the right in Fig.1 and all dipole moments of y-dimers\npoint e.g. up (depending on how precisely the inversion\nsymmetry of the system is broken globally) causing each\nxy-plane to acquire a net ferroelectric moment.\nWe calculate the charge disproportionation \u2206q due to\nan on-site Coulomb interaction U between the electrons\nin the Hartree-Fock approximation. In Fig.3. \u2206q is\nshown as a function of doping. Charge ordering starts\nat x \u223c 0.4 where the intermediate phase appears, and\nhas its maximum at x = 1/2, which coincides with the\ntransition to a pure CE-phase.\nIt is experimentally observed that the CDW deformations in neighboring planes are in phase with each other.\nThis implies that there is a net polarization of the electric\ndipole moments when the system is in the intermediate\nphase, which leads to a ferroelectric ground state. Of\ncourse, in real materials ferroelectric domains may appear. As also the conductivity of these materials is not\nso low, it may not be easy to observe the predicted ferroelectricity in CO manganites. But already first measurements of the dielectric constant \u03b5 do show a strong peak\nin \u03b5(T ) at the charge ordering temperature [8]. A more\ndetailed experimental study of this phenomenon would\ncertainly be of interest in the present context.\nA phenomenological symmetry analysis of possible\norderings in R1\u2212x Cax MnO3 was carried out in Ref.\n[17]. The phases that we find fit exactly into the phe-\n\n\f4\nnomenological classification that these authors propose.\nThey conclude that three phases may exist: one with\nP21 /m symmetry, which coincides with our SCDW CEstructure; another of the Pmn21 type, corresponding\nto our BCDW orthogonal (Zener polaron) state, and a\nstructure with Pm-symmetry that corresponds to our ferroelectric intermediate phase. Experimental structural\nrefinements do show that the actual symmetry of the lowtemperature phase of Pr0.6 Ca0.4 MnO3 is Pm [4], i.e. it is\nin the intermediate phase. Our calculations provide the\nmicroscopic basis for this phenomenological treatment\nand shows that, indeed, all three phases are stable in a\ndoping region close to x \u223c 0.4. Apparently, with increasing x Pr1\u2212x Cax MnO3 goes from the \u22a5 or intermediate\nphase to the CE-phase at around x = 1/2, and then to\nthe C-phase for overdoped samples. The (LaCa)MnO3 system is, due to a larger hopping t, apparently below the\n\u22a5 phase in Fig.2: with increasing doping it goes from F\nto CE and then to the C-phase. In our phase diagram\nthe A-phase appears between the metallic F and \"insulating\" \u22a5 and CE-phases [18], whereas experimentally the\nA-phase usually exists only for x >\n\u223c 0.5 [19]; the reason\nfor this discrepancy is not clear at present.\nWe should remark that we only considered different\nhomogeneous states. It is known, however, that in many\ncorrelated electron models for the manganites the doped\nsystems may be unstable with respect to phase separation (PS) [20]. Also in our analysis we find for the intermediate phase a convex dependence of the energy on\nthe electron density, i.e. there is the tendency for PS\ninto a pure CE and a pure \u22a5 phase with their appropriate electron densities. However, the inclusion of the\nlong-range Coulomb interaction in model calculations of\nthe electronic properties prevents large-scale PS. Such a\nlong-range interaction has to be taken into account in\nthe case of PS, in order to guarantee the total charge\nneutrality of the system. These Coulomb interactions allow only for the formation of weak inhomogeneities with\nsmooth boundaries, which implies that the properties of\nthe resulting PS state are similar to the properties of the\nhomogeneous state. Nevertheless, the question of what\nthe detailed properties of such an inhomogeneous state\nwould be, is an interesting problem and deserves further\ninvestigation.\nConclusions. We have shown that in manganites with\ndoping concentrations close to x = 1/2 a novel type\nof magnetic order can appear besides the well known\nCE-type ordering. In this (\u22a5) phase the neighboring\nspins are, depending on the direction of the bond, either oriented parallel, antiparallel or perpendicular to\neach other. Due to double exchange and orbital ordering, parallel spins form strong dimer-like bonds, which\nwe identify as the Zener polaron state that was recently\nobserved experimentally close to x = 1/2 [4]. In consid-\n\nerable part of the phase diagram an intermediate phase,\nwhich is a superposition of a CE-type and orthogonal\nstate, is stable. We predict that in this charge ordered\nintermediate state inversion symmetry is spontaneously\nbroken and ferroelectric moments appear. This may be\nthe first example of the appearance of ferroelectricity due\nto charge ordering in transition metal oxides.\nWe are grateful to Z. Jirak, T. Fernandez-Diaz, P.\nFulde, J. Hill, M.
