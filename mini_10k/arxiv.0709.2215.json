Energy, link, symplectic measure, M\u00f6bius geometry, pseudo-Riemannian geometry.\n2000 Mathematics Subject Classification. Primary 57M25; Secondary 53A30\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nSince energy of knots was introduced in [14] about twenty years ago, aiming at producing an\noptimal knot for each knot type as an energy minimizer, a lot of related works have appeared,\nwhich form so-called geometric knot theory (see, for example, [4, 5, 16]). The present paper deals\nwith the same type of topic. We introduce a functional on the space of 2-component links such\nthat the absolute minimum is attained only at \"best\" Hopf links, not at trivial links.\nLet C1 \u222a C2 be a 2-component link in S 3 . The value of our functional A(C1 , C2 ) can be\ninterpreted in the following two ways. Observe that the link produces a torus C1 \u00d7C2 in S 3 \u00d7S 3 \\\u2206,\nwhere \u2206 is the diagonal set.\nFirst, there is a natural identification between S 3 \u00d7 S 3 \\ \u2206 and the total space of the cotangent\nbundle T \u2217 S 3 . The pull-back \u03c9 of the canonical symplectic form of T \u2217 S 3 to S 3 \u00d7 S 3 \\ \u2206 is the\nunique 2-form (up to multiplication by a constant) which is invariant under the diagonal action of\nthe M\u00f6bius group. The 2-form \u03c9 can also be consideredR as a natural symplectic\nR form on the space\nof geodesics in a hyperbolic 4-space H 4 . As \u03c9 is exact, C1 \u00d7C2 \u03c9 vanishes, but C1 \u00d7C2 |\u03c9| does not,\nwhich is A(C1 , C2 ). In this sense, it can be considered as an \"absolute symplectic measure\" of the\ntorus C1 \u222a C2 in T \u2217 S 3 .\nSecond, from a M\u00f6bius geometric viewpoint, S 3 \u00d7S 3 \\\u2206 can be identified with the Grassmannian\nmanifold SO(4, 1)/SO(1, 1) \u00d7 SO(3) of oriented time-like 2-dimensional vector subspaces in the 5dimensional Minkowski space R51 . By taking a pseudo-orthogonal complement of an oriented timelike 2-dimensional vector subspace, we can identify this space with the Grassmannian manifold of\noriented space-like 3-dimensional vector subspaces in R51 .\nIt has a natural pseudo-Riemannian structure which is compatible with the action of the Lorentz\ngroup, which induces the diagonal action of the M\u00f6bius group to S 3 \u00d7 S 3 \\ \u2206. Then A(C1 , C2 ) is\nequal to the measure (area) of the torus C1 \u222a C2 with respect to the pseudo-Riemannian metric.\nThe key of the proof is that both the pull-back \u03c9 of the canonical symplectic form and the\n\"imaginary signed area element\" with respect to the pseudo-Riemannian structure coincide with\nthe real part of the infinitesimal cross ratio, which \uf6beis a \"complex valued 2-form\" on C1 \u00d7 C2 used\nin the joint paper with Langevin [12]. \uf6beGeometrically, it can be considered as the cross ratio of\n\u2217 Partly\n\nsupported by the Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (C), Japan Society for the Promotion of Science.\n\n1\n\n\fx, x + dx, y and y + dy, where these four points are considered as complex numbers by identifying\na sphere through them with the Riemann sphere C \u222a {\u221e}.\n\uf6beSome remarks on the result on the energy of links [1], which is another characterization of the\n\"best\" Hopf link, will be given in Subsection 5.4.\nThroughout the paper, a link means a smooth (or at least of class C 1 ) 2-component link.\nAcknowledgment.

He also thanks the referee for a helpful suggestion concerning the\nsymplectic form.\n\nTwo structures on S 3 \u00d7 S 3 \\ \u2206\n\n2\n\nWe introduce two structures on S 3 \u00d7 S 3 \\ \u2206, the symplectic structure and the pseudo-Riemannian\nstructure, both compatible with M\u00f6bius transformations. It is easy to see that both can be\nnaturally generalized to S n \u00d7 S n \\ \u2206 for any n.\n\n2.1\n2.1.1\n\nSymplectic structure of S 3 \u00d7 S 3 \\ \u2206\nVia hyperbolic space\n\n3\n\nAs S can be considered as the boundary of 4-dimensional hyperbolic space H 4 , S 3 \u00d7 S 3 \\ \u2206 can be\nconsidered as the space of oriented geodesics in H 4 , which is denoted by G. The tangent space T\u03b3 G\nalong a geodesic \u03b3 is the space of Jacobi fields along \u03b3. Let \u2207 denote the Levi-Civita connection.\nThen, if we put\n\u03c9g (\u03be, \u03b7) = (\u03be(t), \u2207\u03b3. \u03b7(t)) \u2212 (\u03b7(t), \u2207\u03b3. \u03be(t)) (t \u2208 R)\nfor \u03be, \u03b7 \u2208 T\u03b3 G, where ( , ) denotes the standard inner product on T\u03b3(t) H 4 , then \u03c9g is an isometryinvariant symplectic form on G (see [3, 2C], [11, 3.1]). Since an isometry of H 4 induces a M\u00f6bius\ntransformation of the boundary sphere S 3 , \u03c9g defines a symplectic form on S 3 \u00d7 S 3 \\ \u2206 which is\ninvariant under the diagonal action of the M\u00f6bius group.\n2.1.2\n\nVia cotangent bundle\n\nIt is known that the space G of geodesics in H 4 is symplectomorphic to the cotangent bundle T \u2217 S 3\n[6]. Let us give an identification between S 3 \u00d7 S 3 \\ \u2206 and T \u2217 S 3 explicitly.\nAssume S 3 is the unit sphere in R4 . Let x be a point in S 3 and px : S 3 \\ {x} \u2192 (Spanhxi)\u22a5 be\na stereographic projection. By identifying (Spanhxi)\u22a5 with Tx S 3 \u223c\n= Tx\u2217 S 3 , we obtain a bijection\n\u0001\n\u03c6x : S 3 \\ {x} \u220b y 7\u2192 Tx S 3 \u220b v 7\u2192 px (y) * v \u2208 R \u2208 Tx\u2217 S 3 ,\nwhere * denotes the standard inner product in R4 . It induces a bijection\n\n\u03c6 : S 3 \u00d7 S 3 \\ \u2206 \u220b (x, y) 7\u2192 (x, \u03c6x (y)) \u2208 T \u2217 S 3 .\n\n(1)\n\nLet \u03c9 S 3 be the canonical symplectic form of the cotangent bundle T \u2217 S 3 . Put \u03c9 = \u03c6\u2217 \u03c9 S 3 . In\n[12], we showed that \u03c9 is invariant under the diagonal action of the M\u00f6bius group. The converse is\nalso true. Namely, if a 2-form \u03c1 is invariant under the diagonal action of the M\u00f6bius group, then\n\u03c1 = c \u03c9 for some c \u2208 R (Proposition 5.1 in Appendix). Therefore, we can see that \u03c9 coincides with\n\u03c9g mentioned above up to a constant factor.\n\n2.2\n\nPseudo-Riemannian structure of S 3 \u00d7 S 3 \\ \u2206\n\nThe Minkowski space R51 is R5 with the indefinite inner product\n\nhx, yi = \u2212x0 y0 + x1 y1 + * * * + x4 y4 .\n\b\nThe set of light-like vectors and the origin L = v \u2208 R51 ; hv, vi = 0 is called the light cone. The\n3-sphere can be considered as the projectivization PL of the light cone. It can also be identified\n2\n\n\fisometrically with the intersection of the light cone and a hyperplane given by {x ; hx, ni = \u22121},\nwhere n is a unit time-like vector. A 2-dimensional vector subspace \u03a0 of R51 is said to be time-like\nif h , i|\u03a0 is non-degenerate and indefinite, namely, if \u03a0 intersects the light cone transversely.\nA pair of points in S 3 can be considered as the intersection of S 3 and a 2-dimensional timelike subspace of R51 . Therefore, if we also take the order of the points into account, S 3 \u00d7 S 3 \\ \u2206\nf \u2212 (2; R51 ) of oriented 2-dimensional time-like\ncan be identified with the Grassmannian manifold Gr\n5\nsubspaces of R1 , i.e., a homogeneous space SO(4, 1)/SO(3) \u00d7 SO(1, 1).\nLet \u03a0 be an oriented time-like 2-dimensional plane spanned by an ordered basis {u, v}. Then\n2\nV\n\u03a0 corresponds to a pure 2-vector u \u2227 v \u2208 R51 , which is determined by \u03a0 up to a positive factor.\nAs is stated on page 280 of [9], u \u2227 v is time-like, i.e., hu \u2227 v, u \u2227 vi < 0, where the indefinite inner\n2\nV\nR51 is given by\nproduct on\n\u0001\nhu1 \u2227 u2 , v 1 \u2227 v 2 i = det hui , v j i .\n\nOn the other hand, it is known that a pure 2-vector determines a 2-plane. Thus the Grassmannian\nf \u2212 (2; R5 ) of oriented 2-dimensional time-like subspaces of R5 can be identified with the\nmanifold Gr\n1\n1\n2\n2\np\nV\nV\n5\n5\nR1 , where the norm of\nR1 is given by kvk = |hv, vi|.\nset of unit time-like pure 2-vectors in\nIt is a 6-dimensional pseudo-Riemannian manifold with index 3. By taking a pseudo-orthogonal\nf \u2212 (2; R51 )\ncomplement of an oriented time-like 2-dimensional vector subspace, we can identify Gr\n5\nf\nwith the Grassmannian manifold Gr+ (3; R1 ) of oriented space-like 3-dimensional vector subspaces\nin R51 , which, in turn, can be identified with the set \u0398(0, 3) of unit space-like pure 3-vectors in\n3\nV\nR51 .\nf \u2212 (2; R51 ) to Gr\nf + (3; R51 ) is\nThrough the identifications mentioned above, the bijection from Gr\n3\n2\nV\nV 5\nR51\nR1 to\nequal to the minus of the restriction of the Hodge \u22c6 which is an isomorphism from\ngiven by\n2\n\u0001\nV\na, b \u2208 R51\na \u2227 \u22c6b = ha, bi e0 \u2227 e1 \u2227 * * * \u2227 e4\n(see [9, p.288]).\n\n3\nV\nLet u and v be light-like vectors in R51 . Put u \u00d7 v = \u2212 \u22c6 (u \u2227 v) \u2208 R51 .

Therefore the area\nelement dv is given by \u03c3 \u2217 dv = |h\u03c3x , \u03c3y i| dx \u2227 dy.\nProof. Suppose S 3 is embedded in R51 , and points in C1 and C2 are expressed by x\u0304(s) and \u0233(t),\nrespectively. Put p(s, t) = x\u0304(s) \u00d7 \u0233(t) and \u03c3\u0303(s, t) = \u03c3(x\u0304(s), \u0233(t)). Then it is given by\n\u03c3\u0303(s, t) =\n\np(s, t)\nhp(s, t), p(s, t)i\n\n1/2\n\n.\n\nSince x\u0304 and \u0233 are light-like vectors, the formula (2) implies\nhp, pi = hx\u0304, \u0233i2 , hp, ps i = hx\u0304, \u0233ihx\u0304s , \u0233i, hps , ps i = hx\u0304s , \u0233i2 .\nTherefore\nh\u03c3\u0303s , \u03c3\u0303s i =\n\nhp, pihps , ps i \u2212 hp, ps i2\n= 0.\nhp, pi2\n\nWe also put geometric explanation in Subsection 5.2 in Appendix.\nLet us call h\u03c3x , \u03c3y i dx \u2227 dy the imaginary signed area element of a product torus C1 \u00d7 C2 .\n4\n\n\u2737\n\n\f4\n4.1\n\nProof of the Main Theorem\nThe infinitesimal cross ratio\n\nWe assume that both components C1 and C2 are oriented. Suppose x \u2208 C1 and y \u2208 C2 . Let\n\u0393 (x, x, y) be the circle which is tangent to C1 at x that passes through y, oriented by the tangent\nvectors to C1 at x. Let \u03b8 (0 \u2264 \u03b8 \u2264 \u03c0) be the angle between \u0393 (x, x, y) and the tangent vector to C2\nat y. We call it the conformal angle between x and y and denote it by \u03b8L (x, y). It was introduced\nby Doyle and Schramm.\nLet \u03a9L be a complex valued 2-form on C1 \u00d7 C2 given by\n\u03a9L (x, y) = ei\u03b8L (x,y)\n\ndx \u2227 dy\n|x \u2212 y|2\n\n(6)\n\n(see [12]). As both the conformal angle \u03b8L and the 2-form dxdy/|x \u2212 y|2 are equivariant under the\ndiagonal action of a M\u00f6bius transformation T , so is \u03a9L , namely, (T \u00d7 T )\u2217 \u03a9T (L) = \u03a9L [12].\nLet us give a geometric interpretation of \u03a9L . Let \u03a3L (x, y) be a sphere that passes through four\npoints x, x + dx, y and y + dy, i.e., a sphere which is tangent to C1 at x and to C2 at y. Let p be\nf \u1ef9 and \u1ef9 + dy\nf the images by p\na stereographic projection from \u03a3L (x, y) to C \u222a {\u221e} and x\u0303, x\u0303 + dx,\nof the four points x, x + dx, y and y + dy, respectively. Then \u03a9L (x, y) is equal to the cross ratio\nf \u1ef9; x\u0303, \u1ef9 + dy):\nf\n(x\u0303 + dx,\n\u03a9L (x, y) =\n\nf \u2212 x\u0303\nf dy\nf\n(x\u0303 + dx)\ndx\n\u1ef9 \u2212 x\u0303\n\u223c\n:\n.\nf\nf\nf\n(x\u0303 \u2212 \u1ef9)2\n(x\u0303 + dx) \u2212 (\u1ef9 + dy) \u1ef9 \u2212 (\u1ef9 + dy)\n\n(7)\n\nThis is why we call \u03a9L the infinitesimal cross ratio. We remark that the cross ratio does not\ndepend on the stereographic projection p.\nRemark:\uf6beThe the form dzdw/(z \u2212 w)2 on C \u00d7 C \\ \u2206, which has been used in complex analysis,\ncan also be obtained as the cross ratio of w, w + dw, z and z + dz, as was mentioned by Rob\nKusner, for example. In this sense, the infinitesimal cross ratio can be considered as generalization\nof dzdw/(z \u2212 w)2 to a complex valued 2-form on C1 \u00d7 C2 , or in general, C \u00d7 C \\ \u2206, where C\nis a union of space curves. In fact, when C is a plane curve, the infinitesimal cross ratio can be\nobtained by restricting dzdw/(z \u2212 w)2 to C \u00d7 C \\ \u2206. In this case, it was used by H\u00e9lein [8] to show\nthe isoperimetric inequality.\n\uf6beHowever, there is difficulty for space curves. First, dzdw/(z \u2212 w)2 cannot be generalized to a\n2-form on the ambient space S 3 \u00d7 S 3 \\ \u2206, so the restriction which works for the planar case does\nnot work. To be precise, while the real part of dzdw/(z \u2212 w)2 can be generalized to a 2-form on\nS n \u00d7 S n \\ \u2206 as we will see in the next subsection, the imaginary part cannot when n \u2265 3 as we\nwill see in Proposition 5.2.\n\uf6beSecondly, even if we try to use the cross ratio to define the 2-form, the cross ratio of four points\nin Rn (n \u2265 3) is not so well-behaved as in the planar case. This might be a reason why Ahlfors\nstudied only the absolute cross ratio for the points in Rn (n \u2265 3) [2]. When we want to define\nthe cross ratio of (ordered) four points in R3 , we need the orientation of the sphere through the\nfour points to avoid the ambiguity of complex conjugacy. There is a way to assign continuously\nthe orientations to all the spheres given by the sets of ordered four points in R3 , i.e., there is a\n\u00014\ncontinuous map from R3 \\ \u2206, where \u2206 is a big diagonal set, to the set of oriented 2-speres in R3 ,\nwhich can be identified with the de Sitter space in 5-dimensional Minkowski space R51 . However,\naccording to this method, the imaginary part of the cross ratio of any four points in R3 is always\n\u00014\nnon-negative (or, always non-positive according to the choice of a continuous map from R3 \\ \u2206\nto the de Sitter space). The reader is referred to [15] for the details. \uf6beAs a result, the imaginary\npart of the infinitesimal cross ratio may have singularity where it vanishes, just like that of the\nabsolute value of a smooth function. Anyway, we do not use the imaginary part in this paper.\n\n5\n\n\f4.2\n\nThe real part of the infinitesimal cross ratio\n\nIn [12] we showed that the pull-back of the canonical symplectic form of T \u2217 S 3 to C1 \u00d7 C2 coincides\nwith the real part of the infinitesimal cross ratio up to a constant;\n\u03b9\u2217 \u03c9 = \u03b9\u2217 \u03c6\u2217 \u03c9 S 3 = \u22122 Re \u03a9L = \u22122\n\ncos \u03b8L (x, y) dx \u2227 dy\n.\n|x \u2212 y|2\n\n(8)\n\n\uf6beIt seems that this fact in the case of S 2 is well known in symplectic geometry.\nLemma 4.1 The imaginary signed area element of C1 \u00d7C2 with respect to the pseudo-Riemannian\nstructure coincides with the real part of the infinitesimal cross ratio up to a constant;\nh\u03c3x , \u03c3y i dx \u2227 dy = 2 Re \u03a9L .\n\nProof. Suppose points in C1 and C2 are expressed as x(s) and y(t). Suppose S 3 is embedded in\nR51 as the intersection of the light cone and a level hyperplane {x0 = 1}. Let x\u0304 and \u0233 be points in R51\ncorresponding to x(s) and y(t), i.e., x\u0304(s) = (1, x(s)) and \u0233(t) = (1, y(t)). Put \u03c3\u0303(s, t) = \u03c3(x\u0304(s), \u0233(t))\nas before.\nThe pull-back of the real part of the infinitesimal cross ratio is given by\n((x \u00d7 y)\u2217 Re \u03a9L ) (s, t) =\n\ncos \u03b8L (x(s), y(t)) \u2032\n|x (s)||y \u2032 (t)| ds \u2227 dt.\n|x(s) \u2212 y(t)|2\n\n(9)\n\nOn the other hand, the pull-back of the imaginary signed area element is given by\n((x \u00d7 y)\u2217 (h\u03c3x , \u03c3y i dx \u2227 dy)) (s, t) = h\u03c3\u0303s , \u03c3\u0303t i(s, t) ds \u2227 dt.\n\n(10)\n\nFix any (s0 , t0 ). The M\u00f6bius invariance of the both sides allows us to assume that x(s0 ) and\ny(t0 ) are antipodal. Then, at (s0 , t0 ),\nhx\u0304, x\u0304i = h\u0233, \u0233i = 0, hx\u0304, \u0233i = \u22122.\nTherefore, by the formula (2), at (s0 , t0 ) there holds\nhp, pi = 4, hp, ps i = 0, hps , pt i = \u22122x\u2032 (s0 ) * y \u2032 (t0 ),\nwhich implies\n1\nhp, pihps , pt i \u2212 hp, ps ihp, pt i\n= \u2212 x\u2032 (s0 ) * y \u2032 (t0 ).\n2\nhp, pi\n2\nSince x0 = x(s0 ) and y0 = y(t0 ) are antipodal, we have (Figure 1)\nh\u03c3\u0303s , \u03c3\u0303t i =\n\n\u03b8L (x(s0 ), y(t0 )) = \u03c0 \u2212 \u2220x\u2032 (s0 ) * y \u2032 (t0 ).\nIt follows that\n1\n|x\u2032 (s0 )||y \u2032 (t0 )|\nh\u03c3\u0303s , \u03c3\u0303t i(s0 , t0 ) = \u2212 x\u2032 (s0 ) * y \u2032 (t0 ) = 2\ncos \u03b8L (x(s0 ), y(t0 )),\n2\n|x(s0 ) \u2212 y(t0 )|2\n\nwhich implies that the right-hand sides of (9) and (10) coincide.\n\n\u2737\n\nWe remark that an alternative geometric proof can be obtained if we use pseudo-orthonormal\nbasis of S 3 \u00d7 S 3 \\ \u2206 illustrated in Figure 10. This is because\nh\u03c3\u0303s + \u03c3\u0303t , \u03c3\u0303s + \u03c3\u0303t i(s0 , t0 ) = \u2212x\u2032 (s0 ) * y \u2032 (t0 )\n\nimplies h\u03c3\u0303s , \u03c3\u0303t i(s0 , t0 ) = \u2212(1/2) x\u2032 (s0 ) * y \u2032 (t0 ).\n\nCorollary 4.2 The imaginary signed area element of a product torus C1 \u00d7 C2 with respect to the\npseudo-Riemannian structure is equal to minus the pull-back of the canonical symplectic form:\nh\u03c3x , \u03c3y i dx \u2227 dy = \u2212\u03b9\u2217 \u03c6\u2217 \u03c9 S 3 .\nThis completes the proof of Theorem 3.2 (1).\nWe remark that a statement similar to that of the above corollary does not hold for a general\nsurface in S 3 \u00d7 S 3 \\ \u2206 as we will see in Subsection 5.3 in Appendix.\n6\n\n\fFigure 1:\n\n4.3\n\nProof of Theorem 3.2 (2)\n\nAs\nA(C1 , C2 ) = 2\n\nZ\n\nC1 \u00d7C2\n\n| cos \u03b8L (x, y)|\ndx dy ,\n|x \u2212 y|2\n\n(11)\n\nit is equal to 0 if and only if the conformal angle \u03b8L (x, y) is equal to \u03c0/2 for any x \u2208 C1 and\ny \u2208 C2 .\nSuppose A(C1 , C2 ) = 0. Let x be a point in C1 . Let Cx be the set of the circles which are\ntangent to C1 at x. Then C2 can intersect circles in Cx only at a right angle (Figure 2). Consider\n\nFigure 2: The circles of Cx\n\nFigure 3: The image by \u03c0\n\na stereographic projection \u03c0 from S 3 \\ {x} to R3 . It maps Cx to the set of parallel lines. Since\n\u03c0(C2 ) can intersect lines of \u03c0(Cx ) only at a right angle, \u03c0(C2 ) is contained in a 2-plane which\nis orthogonal to the lines in \u03c0(Cx ) (Figure 3). Therefore, C2 is contained in a sphere \u03a3x which\nintersects C1 at a right angle at x (Figure 4).\nLet x\u2032 be a point of C1 close to x. As C1 intersects \u03a3x orthogonally at x, we can take x\u2032 outside\n\u03a3x . Therefore, \u03a3x 6= \u03a3x\u2032 . Since C2 is contained in the intersection \u03a3x \u2229 \u03a3x\u2032 , C2 must be a circle\n(Figure 5). The same argument shows that C1 is also a circle.\nConsider the stereographic projection \u03c0 again. Since C1 is a circle, \u03c0(C1 ) is a line. Then\n\u03c0(C2 ) is the intersection of two spheres which intersect the line \u03c0(C1 ) at a right angle (Figure 6).\nTherefore, \u03c0(C2 ) is symmetric in the line \u03c0(C1 ). It follows that \u03c0(C1 ) \u222a \u03c0(C2 ) is an image of the\nstandard Hopf link (Figure 6).\nThis completes the proof of Theorem 3.2 (2).\n\n4.4\n\nCorollary and Conjecture\n\nLet [L] denote an isotopy class of a link L.

Suppose L = C1 \u222a C2 is a separable link in R3 . We can make |x \u2212 y| (x \u2208 C1 , y \u2208 C2 ) as\nbig as we like. Now the conclusion follows from the formula (11).\nSuppose L = C1 \u222a C2 is a satellite link of a Hopf link. Then, after an ambient isotopy, it\ncan be contained in a very thin tubular neighbourhood of the standard Hopf link given by (5).\nFurthermore, for any positive constants \u03b41 and \u03b42 , the link can be placed so that, outside a\nsmall region of C1 \u00d7 C2 whose measure is \u03b41 Length(C1 ) * Length(C2 ), the conformal angle satisfies\n|\u03b8L \u2212 \u03c0/2| \u2264 \u03b42 . Then the formula (11) implies the assertion of the corollary since |x \u2212 y| (x \u2208\nC1 , y \u2208 C2 ) is bounded below.\n\u2737\nConjecture 4.4 We conjecture that A([L]) does not always vanish. For example, if L = C1 \u222a C2\nis a hyperbolic link each component of which is a non-trivial knot, then there is no solid torus H1\nso that C1 is contained in H1 and C2 in R2 \\ H1 . We conjecture that A([L]) is positive for such a\nlink type.\n\n8\n\n\f5\n5.1\n\nAppendix\nDiagonal M\u00f6bius invariance characterizes \u03c9\n\nProposition 5.1 Suppose \u03c1 is a 2-form on S n \u00d7 S n \\ \u2206 which is invariant under the diagonal\naction of M\u00f6bius transformations.

Take a point M on l (Figure 8), then it determines two pencils\nas follows.\n10\n\n\fLet a and b be the \"end points\" of the geodesic in H2 which is orthogonal to l at point M\n(the third of Figure 8). Let P+ be a pencil obtained by rotating the geodesic l around M and P\u2212\nthe Poncelet pencil with limit points a and b. Then P+ and P\u2212 can be considered as geodesics in\n\u039b, namely, the intersections with \u039b and space-like and time-like 2-planes \u03a0\u00b1 . A pair of the unit\ntangent vectors to P+ and P\u2212 at \u03c3 can serve as a pseudo-orthonormal basis of T\u03c3 \u039b, where \u03c3 is a\npoint in \u039b that corresponds to \u03a3. These vectors can be obtained in \u03a0\u00b1 by rotation and Lorentz\nboost (hyperbolic rotation) of \u03c3.

Recently, Agol, Marques and Neves\nproved Freedman-He-Wang's conjecture, namely, they showed that if the linking number of C1 and\nC2 is equal to \u00b11, then E(C1 , C2 ) \u2265 2\u03c0 2 , and that the equality holds if and only if C1 \u222a C2 is an\nimage of the \"best\" Hopf link by a M\u00f6bius transformation. This is a much more difficult problem,\nand was proved using min-max theory which has also been used in the proof of the Willmore\nconjecture [13].\n12\n\n\f\uf6beThe formula (11) implies E(C1 , C2 ) \u2265 (1/2)A(C1 , C2 ). To be more precise, the equality does\nnot occur since the conformal angle between different components of a link cannot be identically\nzero. It might be interesting to point out that the infimum of A(C1 , C2 ) over all the 2-component\nlinks is attained not at trivial links, but at the \"best\" Hopf link and the conformal image of it,\nwhereas the infimum of E(C1 , C2 ) over all the 2-component links is not attained, as E(C1 , C2 )\ntends to +0 as the distance between C1 and C2 tends to +\u221e.\n\nReferences\n[1] \uf6beI.
