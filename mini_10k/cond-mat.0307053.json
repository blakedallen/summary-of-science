We interpret the origins and the nature of the in-gap\nstates using a simple variational wavefunction.\nPACS numbers: 71.20.-b, 74.72.-h, 71.30.+h\n\nRecent angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy\n(ARPES) experiments have determined the evolution of the Fermi surface in electron-doped cuprates,\nNd2\u2212x Cex CuO4\u00b1\u03b4 [1]. In contrast to the hole-doped\ncase, small Fermi surface pockets appear first near the Xpoints and then with further doping still in the presence\nof antiferromagnetic (AF) order, in-gap states appear\naround the zone diagonals with the character of renormalized band pockets. A further increase in doping leads\nto the formation of a single large Fermi surface. Note that\nARPES for electron doping is more informative than for\nhole doping since the evolution of the charge-transfer gap\nin the single-particle spectrum can be directly observed.\nIn this Letter we present a systematic investigation of\nthe single-particle properties of electron-doped antiferromagnets using parameters appropriate for the cuprates,\nand discuss the physical origins of the in-gap states.\nThe ARPES experiments give clear evidence for\nelectron-hole asymmetry, in agreement with the significantly different behavior of electron- and hole-doped\ncuprates [1, 2]. Similar contrasting behavior was found\nin recent one-loop renormalization-group studies [3]. A\nclear separation in energy scale between AF and superconducting fluctuations appears for electron-doping\n[3, 4, 5]. This explains the robustness of the AF phase [6]\nand the small doping range of the superconducting phase.\nFor this reason, electron-doped cuprates can be treated as\ndoped antiferromagnets within a coupling weak to moderate scheme, in contrast to hole-doped cuprates, where\nthe AF fluctuations compete with the superconducting\nfluctuations leading to a crossover at relatively high energy scale to a strong coupling phase where all play a role\n[3, 7, 8, 9, 10]. Strong coupling approaches give strong\nasymmetry [11] but the narrow region of the AF order\nupon hole doping greatly limits the approach we use here\nwhich starts from the AF mean-field (MF) state.\nSince the AF Mott insulating state may be adiabatically connected to the MF-AF state at T = 0, the MFAF state can be a good starting point for our purpose\n[12, 13, 14]. In order to take account of the collective\n\nspin-wave excitations (and also the particle-hole continuum), we calculate the single-particle self-energy including multiple exchange of RPA-type transverse spin excitations, i.e., so-called self-consistent Born approximation\n(SCBA) [15, 16]. Within this approach we can demonstrate the following. Away from half-filling small Fermi\nsurface pockets occur first around the X-points, and simultaneously new spectral weight appears in the insulating gap. With further doping the in-gap states acquire the features of a renormalized quasiparticle band\nshowing clear resemblance to that in the paramagnetic\nphase. To explain the physical origin of the in-gap state\nwe introduce a simple variational wavefunction for the ingap state, in which the quasihole MF state in the lower\nband admixes strongly with the hole state accompanied\nby particle-hole spin excitations in the upper band.\nWe work with the t-t\u2032 -U Hubbard model,\nX\nX\nni\u2191 ni\u2193 ,\n(1)\nH=\n\u01ebk c\u2020k\u03c3 ck\u03c3 + U\ni\n\nk\u03c3\n\nwith a next-nearest-neighbor tight-binding dispersion\n\u01ebk = \u22122t(cos kx + cos ky ) \u2212 4t\u2032 cos kx cos ky , where the\nlattice spacing a = 1. Throughout this paper, we set\nt\u2032 /t = \u22120.3 and U/t = 8. The outline of the SCBA calculation is as follows. First, we solve the AF-MF equation to determine the MF gap \u22060 and the MF chemical\npotential \u03bc0 for a given electron density n:\nMBZ \u00b1 \u2191,\u2193\n1 X XX\n1\nm\n=\u2212\n\u03b8(\u03bc0 \u2212 Ekm ) 0 ,\nU\nN\n2E\nk\nm \u03c3\n\n(2)\n\nMBZ \u00b1 \u2191,\u2193\n1 X XX\n\u03b8(\u03bc0 \u2212 Ekm ),\nn=\nN\nm \u03c3\n\n(3)\n\nk\n\nk\n\nwhere the MF-quasiparticle energy in the upper (lower)\nband, m = +1(\u22121), is given by q\nEkm = \u03bek+ + mEk0 , where\n\n\u03bek\u00b1 = (\u01ebk+Q \u00b1 \u01ebk )/2 and Ek0 = (\u03bek\u2212 )2 + \u220620 . Here N is\nthe number of sites and the summation of k is taken over\nthe magnetic Brillouin zone (MBZ).

Sharp quasiparticle peaks appear at the edges of the insulating gap with broad\nincoherent backgrounds of width \u223c 8t. Away from half-filling\nthe spectral weight transfers particularly from the lower band\nto the in-gap states at \u03c9 \u2212 \u03bc \u223c \u2212t. The chemical potential\nlies in the upper quasiparticle band.\n\nwe study in this paper. We set up the RPA transverse\nsusceptibilities (for normal and umklapp processes) using\n\u22060 and \u03bc0 , and solve the Dyson equation for the retarded\nGreen's functions at T = 0 putting these RPA susceptibilities into the one-loop self-energy. RThe true chemical\n\u03bc\npotential, \u03bc, is determined by n = 2 \u2212\u221e d\u03c9\u03c1(\u03c9), where\n\u03c1(\u03c9) is the single-particle density of states (DOS) calculated from the resultant Green's function. We discretize\nthe momentum by 32 \u00d7 32 mesh in the first quadrant and\nthe energy by 1024 mesh in the interval (\u221220t, 20t). Due\nto the omission of vertex corrections, the coupling constant in the self energy is too strong, which overestimates\nrenormalization of the indirect gap [15, 16]. As shown by\nBulut et al. [17], a reduction of the coupling constant\nU mimics the effect of vertex corrections. We obtain a\nreasonable value of the indirect gap at half-filling with\nthe reduced coupling constant, 0.7U , in the self energy.\nFigure 1 shows the doping dependence of the DOS.\nAt half-filling n = 1.00+ (with appropriate shift of the\nchemical potential to the bottom of the upper band), the\nmultiple scattering by spin fluctuations redistributes the\nMF-quasiparticle weight into the incoherent background\nin an energy range \u223c 8t accompanied by sharp quasiparticle peaks at the edges of the insulating gap. Based on\nthe argument similar to Kane et al. for the t-J model\n[18], we can conclude that the quasiparticle residue and\nits width are the order of t/U and 4t2 /U , respectively.\nThe intensity of the incoherent background is considerably enhanced at \u03c9 \u2212 \u03bc \u223c \u22127t and 3t, which results from\nthe coupling of the quasiparticle to interband particlehole excitations across the gap [15, 19].\nWith increasing electron doping, the position of the\nlower band moves down to lower energy with considerable\nreduction of the spectral weight. The reduction of the\nspectral weight, particularly in the lower band, leads to\na transfer into the insulating gap giving rise to the in-gap\n\n(\u03c9 \u2212 \u03bc) / t\n\n0.20\n\n4\n0\n\n-4\n-8\nX\n(\u03c0,0)\n\n\u0393\n(0,0)\n\nM\n(\u03c0,\u03c0)\n\nX M' X\n(\u03c0/2,\u03c0/2)\n\n\u0393\n0.0\n\nM\n\nX M'\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\nFIG. 2: The contour plot for the spectral intensity A(k, \u03c9)\nalong the high-symmetry lines of the Brillouin zone. The\nquasiparticle band appears at the bottom (top) of the upper\n(lower) band for n = 1.00+ . The AF shadow bands with\nrather weak intensity appear along X-\u0393-M\u2032 (M\u2032 -M-X) in the\nupper (lower) band. Upon doping, the in-gap states at \u03c9\u2212\u03bc \u223c\n\u2212t together with the upper quasiparticle band acquire the\nfeatures of a renormalized quasiparticle band similar to that\nin the paramagnetic phase.\n\nstates at \u03c9 \u2212 \u03bc \u223c \u2212t. As the doping increases further the\nin-gap states gain more spectral weight. Note that the\nchemical potential lies in the upper quasiparticle band.\nFigure 2 shows the contour plot for the spectral intensity A(k, \u03c9) along the high-symmetry lines of the Brillouin zone (BZ). At T = 0, the relevant scattering process creates spin excitations, which disturb of the AF\nbackground. Since a coherent motion of a particle in the\ndisturbed background feels an effectively smaller ordered\nmoment, its excitation energy is smaller than that of the\nMF-states. Hence we expect well-defined quasiparticle\nstates at the edges of the renormalized gap unless the\nlong-range order itself is broken. For states with larger\nexcitation energy, multiple scattering creating spin excitations dominates, and broad spectrum of incoherent\nstates appears at energies far from the chemical potential. For n = 1.00+ the spectrum that emerges has\nsharp quasiparticle bands at the edges of broad multiple spin excitation backgrounds as shown in Fig. 2. The\nlower quasiparticle band, which would correspond to the\ncharge-transfer band in the cuprates, has its highest energy and strongest intensity at the M\u2032 -points. These features are confirmed by the ARPES experiment [1]. The\nqualitative form of weight redistribution in A(k, \u03c9) is\nconsistent with the results of extensive quantum Monte\nCarlo simulation for the t-U Hubbard model [19, 20].\nUpon doping the chemical potential moves higher in\nthe upper quasiparticle band, and small Fermi surface\npockets appear close to the X-points as also found in\n\n\f3\n\nA(k,\u03c9) t\n\n1.0\n\nn = 1.00+\n\nn = 1.04\n\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n\nM\n\n0.2\n\u0393\n\n0.0\n1.0\n\nn = 1.07\n\nn = 1.12\n\nA(k,\u03c9) t\n\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n\nM\n\n0.2\n0.0\n-6\n\n-4\n\n-2\n0\n(\u03c9 \u2212 \u03bc) / t\n\n2\n\n4 -6\n\n-4\n\n-2\n0\n(\u03c9 \u2212 \u03bc) / t\n\n2\n\n4\n\n\u0393\n\nFIG. 3: The spectral intensity along \u0393(0, 0)-M(\u03c0, \u03c0) line.

The form of the Fermi\nsurface deformation with doping agrees qualitatively with\nthe ARPES measurement [1].\nIn order to elucidate the origin and the nature of the ingap state, we consider a simple variational wavefunction\n[26].

The quasihole MF state in the lower\nband is described by |p\u03c3\u2212i = \u03b3p\u03c3\u2212 |0i, which couples\nwith multiple spin exchange states via the residual Hubbard interaction, Hint .\nConsider the variational wavefunction defined by\n|\u03a8p\u03c3\u2212 i = sin \u03b8p |p\u03c3\u2212i \u2212 cos \u03b8p |\u03c6p\u03c3 i,\n\n\u0393\n\nX \u0393\n\nX \u0393\n\nX\n\nFIG. 4: The contour plot of A(k, 0) at the chemical potential corresponding to a Fermi-surface plot. Upon doping the\nsmall Fermi surface pockets appear first around the X-points.\nAs the doping increases these pockets deform and become\npieces of the paramagnetic-like Fermi surface indicated by the\ndashed line for n = 1.12.\n\nthe strong coupling calculations of Ref. [11]. These small\npockets provide new decay channels through the creation\nof the particle-hole spin excitations in the upper quasiparticle band. Then, a redistribution of the spectral\nweight again takes place particularly in the lower band,\nleading to a considerable reduction as shown in Figs. 1\nand 2, which must be compensated by the appearance of\nspectral weight elsewhere, i.e., in the in-gap state that\nappears at \u03c9 \u2212 \u03bc \u223c \u2212t. With further doping, the in-gap\nstates become more visible in wide regions of the BZ,\nwhile the shadow bands become less visible except close\nto the chemical potential. As a result, the in-gap states\ntogether with the upper quasiparticle band exhibit clear\nresemblance to a renormalized quasiparticle band in the\nparamagnetic phase with the pseudogap due to strong\nAF fluctuations (so-called hot spots) [21, 22, 23, 24, 25].\nThis is seen more clearly in Fig. 3, in which the in-gap\nstates develop and become dispersive with doping.\nFigure 4 shows the contour plot of A(k, 0) at the chemical potential.

Among these\nstates, the state involving a particle-hole spin excitation\nwithin the upper band makes the dominant contribution\nwhich lowers the energy of the |\u03a8p\u03c3\u2212 i, i.e.,\nMBZ\nX\n1\n\u2020\n|\u03c6p\u03c3 i = p\nf (p, k; q)\u03b3p+q\u03c3+ \u03b3k\u2212q\u03c3\u0304+ \u03b3k\u03c3\u0304+\n|0i,\nAp N k,q\n\n(6)\n\nwhere\nf (p, k; q) = p\u2212 (p + q, p)p+ (k \u2212 q, k) \u2212 [q \u2192 q + Q], (7)\nwith the coherent factor p\u00b1 (k, k\u2032 ) = vk+ vk\u2032 \u00b1 \u00b1 vk\u2212 vk\u2032 \u2213 .\nHere Ap is the appropriate normalization factor.\ntot\nMinimizing the total energy Ep\u2212\n= h\u03a8p\u03c3\u2212 |H|\u03a8p\u03c3\u2212 i\nwith respect to \u03b8p , we obtain the renormalized quasihole\ntot\nenergy, \u1ebcp\u2212 = \u2212(Ep\u2212\n\u2212 E0 ), where E0 = h0|H|0i. For\nsmall doping two holes in the |\u03c6p\u03c3 i have a momentum\nclose to the X-points, i.e., p + q \u223c k \u2212 q \u223c X. Due to the\nmomentum conservation the momentum of the particle is\nk \u223c p. Since the kinetic energy of the |\u03c6p\u03c3 i is the order\nof Ep+ \u2212\u03bc0 and the average of the Coulomb interaction is\nnegligible, the average of the total energy of the |\u03c6p\u03c3 i is\nthe order of Ep+ \u2212\u03bc0 , which is the order of U smaller than\nthat of the hole in the lower band, |p\u03c3\u2212i.

The green (red) line in Fig. 5(a)\nrepresents the renormalized (MF) quasihole band. The\ndispersion of the renormalized quasihole band in Fig. 5(a)\nfollows the curve \u2212Ep+ . The variational evaluation of\nthe quasihole energy agrees reasonably closely with the\nSCBA results except for region close to the \u0393-point. Since\nthe states near the \u0393-point are far from \u03bc0 , the simple\nvariational wavefunction would be poor. Note that a similar variational argument could be hold for hole dopings,\nwhere small hole pockets around the zone diagonals are\ninvolved instead (see Fig. 2).\nSince the renormalization of the order parameter is neglected in this work, the AF phase survives up to a larger\ndoping than the actual value (nc \u223c 1.12). However in reality, there exist well developed short-range order and\nstrong AF fluctuations. As the ARPES experiment is\ninsensitive against the difference between a short-range\norder and true long-range order, our treatment with an\nunrenormalized MF order parameter mimics the presence\nof short-range order. Nevertheless, the renormalization\ncould be important for the smooth evolution of the Fermi\nsurface near nc accompanied by the appearance of spectral weight around the zone diagonals [1, 2]. These features are reproduced by MF approaches with renormalization of the ordered moment[12]. A more sophisticated\ntheoretical treatment is needed to describe this smooth\nevolution of the spectra as the AF order changes rapidly\nfrom long to short range.\nIn summary, we have studied systematically the evolution of the single-particle spectrum in the doped antiferromagnetic insulator. Starting from the MF antiferromagnetic insulator, we take into account multiple\nexchange of transverse spin excitations in the self energy. Away from half-filling we observe small Fermi sur-\n\nface pockets near the X-points and simultaneously the\nin-gap quasiparticle states, which eventually evolve into\na renormalized quasiparticle band similar to that in the\nparamagnetic phase. We have proposed the simple variational wavefunction for the in-gap state, where the lower\nquasihole state admixes strongly with the upper quasihole state accompanied by a particle-hole excitation in\nthe upper quasiparticle band. We have demonstrated\nthat the weak-coupling treatment starting from the AF\ninsulator gives a good description of the single-particle\nspectrum of the electron-doped cuprates.\nWe would like to thank W.
