This\npaper is concerned with sources which are coherent structures for which the group velocities in the\nfar field point away from the core.

Using a modified Burgers equation as a model problem that captures\nsome of the essential features of coherent structures, we show how this phenomenon can be analysed\nand nonlinear stability be established in this simpler context.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn this paper, we analyse the long-time dynamics of solutions to the Burgers-type equation\n\u0010 cx \u0011\n\u03c6t + c tanh\n\u03c6x = \u03c6xx + \u03c62x ,\nc>0\n2\n\n(1.1)\n\nwith small localized initial data, where x \u2208 R, t > 0, and \u03c6(x, t) is a scalar function. The key feature\nof this equation as opposed to the usual Burgers equation is that the characteristic speeds are c > 0 at\nspatial infinity and \u2212c < 0 at spatial minus infinity: hence, transport is always directed away from the\nshock interface at x = 0 and not towards x = 0 as would be the case for the Lax shocks of the standard\nBurgers equation.\nWe are interested in (1.1) due to its close connection with the dynamics of coherent structures that arise\nin reaction-diffusion systems\nx \u2208 R,\n\nut = Duxx + f (u),\n1\n\nu \u2208 Rn .\n\n(1.2)\n\n\fFigure 1: Panel (i) shows the graph of a source u\u2217 (x, t) as a function of x for fixed time t: the group velocities\nof the asymptotic wave trains point away from the core of the coherent structure. Panel (ii) illustrates the\nFloquet spectrum of a spectrally stable source: the two eigenvalues at the origin correspond to translations\nin space and time, which, in contrast to the essential spectrum, cannot be moved by exponential weights.\nPanel (iii) shows the behaviour of small phase \u03c6 or wave number \u03c6x perturbations of a wave train: to leading\norder, they are transported with speed given by the group velocity cg without changing their shape [1].\n\nA coherent structure (or defect) is a solution u\u2217 (x, t) of (1.2) that is time-periodic in an appropriate moving\nframe y = x \u2212 c\u2217 t and spatially asymptotic to wave-train solutions, which are spatially periodic travelling\nwaves of (1.2). Such structures have been observed in many experiments and in various reaction-diffusion\nmodels, and we refer to [6] for references and to Figure 1 for an illustration of typical defect profiles. For\nthe sake of simplicity, we shall assume from now on that the speed c\u2217 of the defect we are interested in\nvanishes, so that the coherent structure is time-periodic. Coherent structures can be classified into several\ndistinct types [2, 5, 6] that have different stability and multiplicity properties. This classification involves\nthe group velocities of the asymptotic wave trains, and we therefore briefly review their definition and\nfeatures. Wave trains of (1.2) are solutions of the form u(x, t) = uwt (kx \u2212 \u03c9t; k), where the profile uwt (y; k)\nis 2\u03c0-periodic in the y-variable. Thus, k and \u03c9 represent the spatial wave number and the temporal\nfrequency, respectively, of the wave train. Wave trains typically exist as one-parameter families, where the\nfrequency \u03c9 = \u03c9nl (k) is a function, the so-called nonlinear dispersion relation, of the wave number k, which\nvaries in an open interval. The group velocity cg of the wave train with wave number k is defined as\ncg :=\n\nd\u03c9nl\n(k).\ndk\n\nThe group velocity is important as it is the speed with which small localized perturbations of a wave train\npropagate as functions of time t, and we refer to Figure 1(iii) for an illustration and to [1] for a rigorous\njustification of this statement. The classification of coherent structures mentioned above is based on the\ngroup velocities c\u00b1\ng of the asymptotic wave trains at x = \u00b1\u221e. We are interested in sources for which\n\u2212\n+\ncg < 0 < cg as illustrated in Figure 1(i) so that perturbations are transported away from the defect core\ntowards infinity. Sources are important as they actively select wave numbers in oscillatory media; examples\nof sources are the Nozaki\u2013Bekki holes of the complex Ginzburg\u2013Landau equation.\nFrom now on, we focus on a given source and discuss its stability properties with respect to the reactiondiffusion system (1.2). Spectral stability of a source can be investigated through the Floquet spectrum of\nthe period map of the linearization of (1.2) about the time-periodic source. Spectral stability of sources\nwas investigated in [6], and we now summarize their findings. The Floquet spectrum of a spectrally stable\nsource will look as indicated in Figure 1(ii). A source u\u2217 (x, t) has two eigenvalues at the origin with\neigenfunctions u\u2217x (x, t) and u\u2217t (x, t); the associated adjoint eigenfunctions are necessarily exponentially\nlocalized, so that the source has a well defined spatial position and temporal phase. There will also be two\ncurves of essential spectrum that touch the origin and correspond to phase and wave number modulations\n2\n\n\fFigure 2: The left panel contains a sketch of the space-time diagram of a perturbed source. The defect core\nwill adjust in response to an imposed perturbation, and the emitted wave trains, whose maxima are indicated\nby the lines that emerge from the defect core, will therefore exhibit phase fronts that travel with the group\nvelocities of the asymptotic wave trains away from the core towards \u00b1\u221e. The right panel illustrates the\nprofile of the anticipated phase function \u03c6(x, t) defined in (1.3).\n\nof the two asymptotic wave trains. It turns out that the two eigenvalues at the origin cannot be removed\nby posing the linearized problem in exponentially weighted function spaces; the essential spectrum, on the\nother hand, can be moved to the left by allowing functions to grow exponentially at infinity.\nThe nonlinear stability of spectrally stable sources has not yet been established, and we now outline why\nthis is a challenging problem. From a purely technical viewpoint, an obvious difficulty is related to the fact\nthat there is no spectral gap between the essential spectrum and the imaginary axis. As discussed above,\nsuch a gap can be created by posing the linear problem on function spaces that contain exponentially\ngrowing functions, but the nonlinear terms will then not even be continuous. To see that these are not just\ntechnical obstacles, it is illuminating to discuss the anticipated dynamics near a source from an intuitive\nperspective. If a source is subjected to a localized perturbation, then one anticipated effect is that the\ndefect core adjusts its position and its temporal phase in response. From its new position, the defect will\ncontinue to emit wave trains with the same selected wave number but there will now be a phase difference\nbetween the asymptotic wave trains at infinity and those newly emitted near the core. In other words,\nwe expect to see two phase fronts that travel in opposite directions away from the core as illustrated in\nFigure 2. The resulting phase dynamics can be captured by writing the perturbed solution u(x, t) as\nu(x, t) = u\u2217 (x + \u03c6(x, t), t) + w(x, t),\n\n(1.3)\n\nwhere we expect that the perturbation w(x, t) of the defect profile decays in time, while the phase \u03c6(x, t)\nresembles an expanding plateau as indicated in Figure 2 whose height depends on the initial perturbation\nthrough the spatio-temporal displacement of the defect core.\nThe preceding discussion indicates that localized perturbations of a defect will not stay localized but result\ninstead in phase fronts that propagate towards infinity. As a first step towards a general nonlinear stability\nresult for sources in reaction-diffusion systems, we focus here on the Burgers-type equation\n\u0010 cx \u0011\n\u03c6x = \u03c6xx + \u03c62x ,\nc>0\n(1.4)\n\u03c6t + c tanh\n2\nfor the phase function \u03c6(x, t) introduced in (1.3). The rationale for choosing this model problem is as\nfollows. First, as established formally in [3] and proved rigorously in [1], the integrated viscous Burgers\n3\n\n\fequation captures the phase dynamics of wave trains over long time intervals. Since the Burgers equation\ndoes not admit sources, we add the artificial advection term on the left-hand side which creates the\ncharacteristic speeds \u00b1c at x = \u00b1\u221e that account for the outgoing group velocities of the asymptotic\nwave trains of the source. While the inhomogeneous advection term can be thought of as fixing the\nposition x = 0 of the core, the equation still has a family of constant solutions, which correspond to\ndifferent temporal phases of the underlying hypothetical sources. We therefore feel that gaining a detailed\nunderstanding of the long-time dynamics of (1.4) for small localized initial data will shed significant light\non the expected dynamics of sources and on the techniques needed to analyse their stability. We emphasize\nthat the dynamics of wave trains of reaction-diffusion systems under non-localized phase perturbations was\ninvestigated only recently in [7]; the methods used there rely on renormalization-group techniques which\nseem difficult to generalize to sources. On the other hand, the analysis presented here is currently far more\nlimited in terms of the equations it applies to.\nThe linearization of (1.4) about \u03c6 = 0 is given by\n\u03c6t = \u03c6xx \u2212 c tanh\n\n\u0010 cx \u0011\n2\n\n\u03c6x .\n\n(1.5)\n\nThe spectrum of the operator in (1.5) is as shown in Figure 1(ii) except that there is only one embedded\neigenvalue at the origin that cannot be moved by exponential weights: the eigenfunction of the eigenvalue\nat \u03bb = 0 is given by the constant function 4c , and the associated adjoint eigenfunction \u03c8 is given by\n\u0010 cy \u0011\n\u03c8(y) = sech2\n.\n2\nEquation (1.5) admits1 the Green's function\nG(x, y, t) =\n\n\u221a\n\n1 \u2212 (x\u2212y\u2212ct)2\n1 \u2212 (x\u2212y+ct)2\n1\n1\n4t\n4t\n\u221a\n+\ne\ne\ncy\n1\n+\ne\n1\n+\ne\u2212cy\n4\u03c0t\n4\u03c0t\n\u0014\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\u0015\nc\ny \u2212 x + ct\ny \u2212 x \u2212 ct\n\u221a\n\u221a\n+ errfn\n\u2212 errfn\n\u03c8(y),\n4\n4t\n4t\n\n(1.6)\n\nwhere the error function is given by\n1\nerrfn(z) = \u221a\n\u03c0\n\nZ\n\nz\n\n2\n\ne\u2212s ds.\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nThe first two terms in the Green's function are Gaussians that move with speed \u00b1c away from the core\n\u221a\nand decay at the rate 1/ t, while the term comprised of the difference of the two error functions produces\na plateau of constant height 4c that spreads outward as indicated in Figure 3.\nFor sufficiently localized initial data \u03c60 (x), the solution \u03c6(x, t) to the linear equation (1.5) is therefore\ngiven by\nZ\n\u03c6(x, t) =\nG(x, y, t)\u03c60 (y) dy,\nR\n\nwhich converges to a constant:\n\u03c6(x, t) \u2212\u2192\n\nc\n4\n\nZ\n\u03c8(y)\u03c60 (y) dy\n\nas\n\nt \u2212\u2192 \u221e\n\nR\n\n1\n\nNote that (1.5) is the formal adjoint of the linearization of the standard viscous Burgers equation ut = uzz \u2212 2uuz about\nthe Lax shock \u016b(x) = (c/2)[1 \u2212 tanh(cx/2)] with x = z \u2212 ct, whose Green's function can be found via the linearized Cole\u2013\nRx\nHopf transformation by setting w(x, t) = cosh(cx/2) \u2212\u221e u(y, t) dy. The Green's function of (1.5) can then be constructed by\nreversing the roles of x and y in the Green's function for the Lax shock linearization.\n\n4\n\n\f\u221a\n\u221a\nFigure 3: Shown are the graphs of the function errfn((\u2212z + ct)/ 4t) \u2212 errfn((\u2212z \u2212 ct)/ 4t) for smaller and\nlarger values of t, which resemble plateaus of height approximately equal to one that spread outwards with\nspeed \u00b1c.\n\nfor each fixed x. In particular, one cannot expect the solution associated with localized initial data to\nremain localized for all time. In fact, the same is true for the nonlinear equation (1.4): the Cole\u2013Hopf\ntransformation\nh\ni\n\u03c6\u0303(x, t) = e\u03c6(x,t) \u2212 1,\n\u03c6(x, t) = log 1 + \u03c6\u0303(x, t)\nrelates solutions \u03c6(x, t) of (1.4) and solutions \u03c6\u0303(x, t) of the linearization (1.5), and we conclude that\nsolutions \u03c6(x, t) of (1.4) are given by\n\u0014\n\u0015\nZ\n\u03c6(x, t) = log 1 +\nG(x, y, t)\u03c60 (y) dy .\nR\n\nFor t \u2192 \u221e, these solutions converge again pointwise in x to the constant\n\u0014Z\n\u0015\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u03c60 (y)\nlog\n\u03c8(y) e\n\u2212 1 dy + 1 .\nR\n\nThe Cole\u2013Hopf transformation does not, however, extend to more general equations, and we therefore\npursue here a different approach that, we hope, will also be useful when investigating the nonlinear stability\nof sources in general reaction-diffusion systems.\nIn order to analyze the dynamics of (1.4) in a way that may also be applicable in the case of a general\nreaction-diffusion equation, we need to find an appropriate ansatz for small-amplitude solutions. To do so,\nwe define B(x, t) by\nB(x, t) := G(x, 0, t + 1),\nwhere G(x, y, t) is the Green's function defined in (1.6), and note that\n\u03c6\u2217 (x, t, p) := log (1 + pB(x, t))\n\n(1.7)\n\nis then a solution2 of (1.4) for each fixed p \u2208 R. We now investigate the long-time dynamics of solutions\nto (1.4) with initial data \u03c6(x, 0) = \u03c60 (x) using the ansatz\n\u03c6(x, t) = \u03c6\u2217 (x, t, p(t)) + v(x, t),\n\n(1.8)\n\nwhere p(t) is a real-valued function, and v(x, t) is a remainder term. At time t = 0, we normalize the\ndecomposition in (1.8) by choosing p(0) = p0 such that\nZ\n\u03c8(x)[\u03c60 (x) \u2212 \u03c6\u2217 (x, 0, p0 )] dx = 0.\nR\n\nIn fact, \u03c6\u2217 (x, t, p) does not need to satisfy (1.4) exactly: our analysis goes through provided B(x, t) can be chosen such\nthat \u03c6\u2217 (x, t, p) satisfies (1.4) approximately with an error of order of (1 + t)\u22121 times a Gaussian.\n2\n\n5\n\n\fWe will prove in \u00a72 that a unique p0 with this property exists for each sufficiently small localized initial\ncondition \u03c60 . Note that the leading behavior \u03c6\u2217 (x, t, p(t)) corresponds to a plateau with height log(1+p(t))\nof length 2ct that spreads outward with speed \u00b1c. The main result of this paper is as follows.\nTheorem 1. For each \u03b3 \u2208 (0, 21 ), there exist constants \u000f0 , \u03b70 , C0 , M0 > 0 such that the following is true.\nIf \u03c60 \u2208 C 1 satisfies\n2\n\u000f := kex /M0 \u03c60 kC 1 \u2264 \u000f0\n(1.9)\nthen the solution \u03c6(x, t) of (1.4) with \u03c6(*, 0) = \u03c60 exists globally in time and can be written in the form\n\u03c6(x, t) = \u03c6\u2217 (x, t, p(t)) + v(x, t)\nfor appropriate functions p(t) and v(x, t) with \u03c6\u2217 as in (1.7). Furthermore, there is a p\u221e \u2208 R with\n|p\u221e | \u2264 C0 such that\n|p(t) \u2212 p\u221e | \u2264 \u000fC0 e\u2212\u03b70 t ,\nand v(x, t) satisfies\n\u000fC0\n|v(x, t)| \u2264\n(1 + t)\u03b3\n\n\u0012 (x+ct)2\n\u0013\n(x\u2212ct)2\n\u2212 M (t+1)\n\u2212 M (t+1)\ne 0\n+e 0\n,\n\n\u000fC0\n|vx (x, t)| \u2264\n(1 + t)\u03b3+1/2\n\nfor all t \u2265 0. In particular, kv(*, t)kLr \u2192 0 as t \u2192 \u221e for each fixed r >\n\n\u0013\n\u0012 (x+ct)2\n(x\u2212ct)2\n\u2212 M (t+1)\n\u2212 M (t+1)\ne 0\n+e 0\n\n1\n2\u03b3 .\n\nNote that our result assumes that the initial condition is strongly localized in space. We believe that this\nassumption can be relaxed significantly; for the purposes of this paper, however, phase fronts are created\neven by highly localized initial data, and the key difficulties are therefore present already in the more\nspecialized situation of Theorem 1.\nThe exponential convergence of p(t) reflects the intuition that a source has a well-defined position due to\nthe exponential localization of the adjoint eigenfunction \u03c8. The asymptotics of the perturbation v is given\n1\nby moving Gaussians that decay only like (1 + t)\u2212\u03b3 for each fixed \u03b3 \u2208 (0, 12 ), rather than with (1 + t)\u2212 2 as\nexpected from the dynamics of the viscous Burgers equation. This weaker result is due to the form (1.8)\nof our ansatz, which effectively creates a nonlinear term that is proportional to g(x)uux for some function\ng(x). While this term resembles the term 2uux in Burgers equation, it does not respect the conservationlaw structure. Thus, we only obtain decay at the above rate. Although this may not be optimal, it allows\nus to avoid terms that grow logarithmically in the nonlinear iteration in \u00a72. We do not know if it is possible\nto improve this rate to \u03b3 = 12 by adjusting our ansatz appropriately.\nThe remainder of this paper, \u00a72, is devoted to the proof of Theorem 1.\n\n2\n\nProof of the main theorem\n\nTo prove Theorem 1, we set up integral equations for (p, v) and solve them using a nonlinear iteration\nscheme. Throughout the proof, we denote by C possibly different positive constants that depend only on\nthe underlying equation but not on the initial data or on space or time.\n\n6\n\n\f2.1\n\nDerivation of an integral formulation\n\nSubstituting the ansatz\nB(x, t) := G(x, 0, t + 1),\n\n\u03c6(x, t) = log (1 + p(t)B(x, t)) + v(x, t),\ninto the Burgers-type equation\n\u03c6t + c tanh\n\n\u0010 cx \u0011\n2\n\n\u03c6x = \u03c6xx + \u03c62x ,\n\nwe find that (p, v) needs to satisfy the equation\nvt = vxx \u2212 c tanh\n\n\u0010 cx \u0011\n2\n\nvx + vx2 \u2212\n\n\u1e57\nG(x, 0, t + 1) + N (x, t, p, \u1e57, vx ),\n1 + 4c p\n\n(2.1)\n\nwhere the nonlinear function N is given by\n2pvx Bx (x, t)\n+ \u1e57\nN (x, t, p, \u1e57, vx ) :=\n1 + pB(x, t)\n\n\u0012\n\nB(x, t)\nB(x, t)\n\u2212\n1 + 4c p 1 + pB(x, t)\n\n\u0013\n.\n\nThe idea of the proof is to use an appropriate integral representation for v that will allow us to set up a\nnonlinear iteration argument to show that solutions (p, v) of (2.1) exist and that they satisfy the desired\ndecay estimates in space and time.

The resulting integral equation has a solution \u1e57(t) for small times and, using again (1.8), we find a\nsmooth function v that then satisfies (2.10). Furthermore, using that \u03c60 satisfies (1.9) by assumption, we\nsee that h(t) is well defined and continuous for 0 < t \u001c 1. Finally, standard parabolic theory implies that\nh(t) retains these properties as long as h(t) stays bounded. The key issue is therefore to show that h(t)\nstays bounded for all times t > 0, and this is what the following proposition asserts.\nProposition 2.1. For each \u03b3 \u2208 (0, 21 ), there exist positive constants \u000f0 , C0 , M such that\nh1 (t) \u2264 C0 (\u000f + h2 (t) + h(t)2 ),\nfor all t \u2265 0 and all initial data u0 with \u000f := kex\n\n2 /M\n\nh2 (t) \u2264 C0 (\u000f + h(t)2 ).\n\n(2.12)\n\n\u03c60 kC 1 \u2264 \u000f0 .\n\nUsing this proposition, we can add the inequalities in (2.12) and eliminate h2 on the right-hand side to\nobtain\nh(t) \u2264 C0 (C0 + 1)(\u000f + h(t)2 ).\nUsing this inequality and the continuity of h(t), we find that h(t) \u2264 2C0 (C0 + 1)\u000f for all t \u2265 0 provided\n0 < \u000f \u2264 \u000f0 is sufficiently small. Thus, Theorem 1 will be proved once we establish Proposition 2.1.

In particular, the proof of Proposition 2.1 is complete once the two estimates above are established.\nWe denote by C1 possibly different constants that depend only on the choice of \u03b3, M so that C1 = C1 (\u03b3, M ).\nWe focus first on v(x, t). From the integral formulation (2.10) for v(x, t), we find that\nZ\n|v(x, t)| \u2264 C1 (|p0 | + |p(t)|) G\u0303(x, 0, t + 1) +\nG\u0303(x, y, t)|v0 (y)| dy\nR\nZ tZ\n\u0002\n\u0003\n+\nG\u0303(x, y, t \u2212 s) vy2 + N (*, *, p, \u1e57, vy ) (y, s) dy ds\n0\nR\nZ tZ\n\u0002\n\u0003\n+\n[e(x, t \u2212 s + 1) \u2212 e(x, t + 1)]\u03c8(y) vy2 + N (*, *, p, \u1e57, vy ) (y, s) dy ds.\n0\n\n(2.22)\n\nR\n\nIn the remainder of this section, we will estimate the right-hand side of (2.22) term by term.\nFirst, we note that (2.5) implies that there is a constant C1 = C1 (M ) so that G\u0303(x, 0, t + 1) \u2264 C1 \u03b81 (x, t).\nUsing (2.16) and the fact that |p(0)| \u2264 C1 \u000f, we therefore obtain\n(|p(0)| + |p(t)|)G\u0303(x, 0, t + 1) \u2264 C1 (\u000f + h2 (t))\u03b81 (x, t),\nwhich is the desired estimate for the first term on the right-hand side of (2.22).\nNext, we consider the integral term in (2.22) that involves the initial data v0 . Using (2.5) together with\nour assumption (1.9) on \u03c60 , and hence on v0 , we see that\n\u0013\n\u0012\nZ\nZ\n(x\u2212y\u2212ct)2\n(x\u2212y+ct)2\ny2\n\u2212\n\u22121/2\n\u2212\n4t\n4t\n+e\ne\u2212 M dy,\n(2.23)\n|G\u0303(x, y, t)v0 (y)| dy \u2264 C\u000f t\ne\nR\n\nR\n\n11\n\n\fwhich is clearly bounded by \u000fC1 \u03b81 (x, t) for t \u2265 1 upon using\ne\u2212\n\n(x\u2212y\u00b1ct)2\n4t\n\ny2\n\ne \u2212 M \u2264 C1 e \u2212\n\n(x\u00b1ct)2\nMt\n\ny2\n\ne\u2212 2M .\n\nFor t \u2264 1, we can use the estimates\ne\u2212\nZ\nt\n\n\u22121/2\n\n(x\u2212y\u00b1ct)2\n8t\n\n\u0012\n\ne\u2212\n\ny2\n\ne\u2212 M \u2264 2e\u2212\n\n(x\u2212y+ct)2\n8t\n\n(x\u2212y)2\n8t\n\ny2\n\nx2\n\ne\u2212 M \u2264 C1 e\u2212 2M\n\u0013\n(x\u2212y\u2212ct)2\ndy \u2264 C1\n+ e\u2212 8t\n\nR\n\nto conclude that the integral in (2.23) is again bounded by \u000fC1 \u03b81 (x, t).\nWe now consider the remaining two integrals in (2.22). Note that the definition of h1 gives\n|vy (y, s)| \u2264 \u03b82 (y, s)h1 (s).\nUsing this fact together with the estimates (2.16) and (2.17) and the bound (2.13), we obtain\n\u0012\n\u0013\n(y+cs)2\n(y\u2212cs)2\n\u2212\n\u2212\n|N (y, s, p(s), \u1e57(s), vy (y, s))| \u2264 C1 (1 + s)\u22121/2 e 8(s+1) + e 8(s+1) |vy (y, s)||p(s)|\n\u0012\n\u0013\n(y+cs)2\n(y\u2212cs)2\n\u2212 8(s+1)\n\u2212 8(s+1)\n+C1 e\n+e\n|p(s)\u1e57(s)|\n\u0012\n\u0013\n(y+cs)2\n(y\u2212cs)2\n\u2212 8(s+1)\n\u2212 8(s+1)\n\u22121/2\n\u2264 C1 (\u000f + h2 (t))h1 (t)\u03b82 (y, s)(1 + s)\ne\n+e\n\u0012\n\u0013\n(y+cs)2\n(y\u2212cs)2\nc2 s\n\u2212\n\u2212\n+C1 (\u000f + h(t)2 )e\u2212 M e 8(s+1) + e 8(s+1)\n\u0014\n\u0015\n2\n2\n\u03b3\u22121/2\n\u03b3\n\u2212 cMs\n\u2264 C1 (\u000f + h(t) ) (1 + s)\n\u03b81 (y, s)\u03b82 (y, s) + (1 + s) \u03b81 (y, s)e\n.\nIn \u00a72.5, we will prove the following result for our spatio-temporal template functions.\nLemma 2.2.

We shall check only the term\ninvolving (1 + s)\u03b3\u22121/2 \u03b81 \u03b82 as the other cases are similar and, in fact, easier. We have shown above that\nthe resulting integrals are bounded for 0 \u2264 t \u2264 1 and therefore focus on the case t \u2265 1. Using that\n|G\u0303x | \u2264 Ct\u22121/2 |G\u0303|, which follows by inspection, and employing again (2.27), we obtain\n\u22121\n\nZ tZ\n\n|G\u0303x (x, y, t \u2212 s)|(1 + s)\u03b3\u22121/2 \u03b81 \u03b82 (y, s) dy ds\n0\nR\ns\nZ t\n1\n4M (1 + s)(t \u2212 s)\n\u2264 C1 (1 + t)\u03b3+1/2\nds\n\u03b3+1\n4(t \u2212 s) + M (1 + s)\n0 (t \u2212 s)(1 + s)\nZ t/2\nZ t\n1\n1\n1\n1\n\u2264 C1 (1 + t)\u03b3+1/2\nds\n+\nC\nds\n1\n1/2\n\u03b3+1/2\n1/2\n1/2\nt (1 + s)\n(1 + t)\n(1 + t)1/2\n0\nt/2 (t \u2212 s)\n\n\u03b82 (x, t)\n\n\u2264 C1 (1 + t)\u03b3 t\u22121/2 + C1 ,\nwhich is bounded for t \u2265 1. This completes the proof of Lemma 2.2.\nProof of Lemma 2.3. We need to show that\nZ tZ\n|e(x, t \u2212 s + 1) \u2212 e(x, t + 1)|\u03c8(y)[vy2 + N (*, *, p, \u1e57, vy )](y, s) dy ds \u2264 C1 (\u000f + h(t)2 )\u03b81 (x, t).\n0\n\nR\n\nIntuitively, this integral should be small for the following reason. The difference e(x, t \u2212 s) \u2212 e(x, t + 1)\nconverges to zero as long as s is not too large, say on the interval s \u2208 [0, t/2]. For s \u2208 [t/2, t], on the other\nhand, we will get exponential decay in s from the localization of \u03c8(y) in combination with the propagating\nGaussians that appear in the nonlinearity and forcing terms. To make this precise, we write\ne(x, t \u2212 s) \u2212 e(x, t + 1) = e(x, t \u2212 s) \u2212 e(x, t \u2212 s + 1) + e(x, t \u2212 s + 1) \u2212 e(x, t + 1) .\n|\n{z\n} |\n{z\n}\nterm I\n\n15\n\nterm II\n\n(2.28)\n\n\fWe focus first on the term I and consider the cases t \u2265 1 and 0 \u2264 t \u2264 1 separately. First, let t \u2265 1. For\n0 \u2264 s \u2264 t \u2212 1, we have |e(x, t \u2212 s) \u2212 e(x, t \u2212 s + 1)| \u2264 C G\u0303(x, 0, t \u2212 s), and we can estimate the resulting\nintegral above in the same way as in the proof of Lemma 2.2; we omit the details. For t \u2212 1 \u2264 s \u2264 t \u2264 1,\non the other hand, the definition of e(x, t \u2212 s) yields\nx2\n(t\u2212s)\n\nZ\n|e(x, t \u2212 s) \u2212 e(x, t \u2212 s + 1)| \u2264 C\n\nx2\n(1+t\u2212s)\n\n2\n\ne\u2212z dz \u2264 Ce\u2212x\n\n2 /2\n\n.\n\n(2.29)\n\nUsing (2.18)-(2.19), namely\n2c2\n\nc\n\n|\u03c8(y)N (y, s, p, \u1e57, vy )| \u2264 Ce\u2212 2 |y|\u2212 M s (\u000f + h(t)2 )\n\n(2.30)\n\nfor all s \u2265 0, we obtain\nZ t Z\n[e(x, t \u2212 s) \u2212 e(x, t \u2212 s + 1)]\u03c8(y)|N (y, s, p, \u1e57, vy )|(y, s) dy ds\nt\u22121\n\nR\n2\n\nZ\n\nt\n\n\u2264 C1 (\u000f + h(t) )\n\ne\u2212\n\nx2\n2\n\ne\u2212\n\n2c2 s\nM\n\nds \u2264 C1 (\u000f + h(t)2 )e\u2212\n\nx2\n2\n\ne\u2212\n\n2c2 t\nM\n\n,\n\nt\u22121\n2 t/M\n\nwhich is clearly bounded by C1 \u03b81 (x, t) since e\u2212c\n\n\u2264 C1 (1 + t)\u2212\u03b3 and\n\n(x + ct)2\n2x2 4c2 c2 t\n\u2264\n+\n+\nM (1 + t)\nM\nM\nM\nfor arbitrary M \u2265 4. In summary, we have established the desired estimates for the term I in (2.28) for\nt \u2265 1. For t \u2264 1, the estimate (2.29) remains true since t \u2212 s is small, and proceeding as above yields\nZ tZ\n2c2 t\nx2\n[e(x, t \u2212 s) \u2212 e(x, t \u2212 s + 1)]\u03c8(y)|N (y, s, p, \u1e57, vy )| dy ds \u2264 C(\u000f + h(t)2 )e\u2212 2 e\u2212 M ,\n0\n\nR\n\nwhich is again bounded by C1 \u03b81 (x, t).\nIt remains to discuss the term II which involves the difference e(x, t \u2212 s + 1) \u2212 e(x, t + 1).
