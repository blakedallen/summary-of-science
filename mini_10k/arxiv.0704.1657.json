Introduction and Summary\nGauge invariant operators play a central role in the gauge theory holographically\ndescribing quantum gravity with AdS boundary conditions [1][2][3], as correlation functions\nof gauge invariant operators are the only observables in the boundary gauge theory. Finding\nthe bulk description of all gauge invariant operators is necessary in order to be able to\nformulate an arbitrary bulk experiment in terms of gauge theory variables.\nIn this paper we provide the bulk description of a novel class of half-BPS operators\nin N = 4 SYM which are supported on a surface \u03a3 [4]. These nonlocal surface operators\nO\u03a3 are defined by quantizing N = 4 SYM in the presence of a certain codimension two\n\nsingularity for the classical fields of N = 4 SYM. The singularity characterizing such a\n\nsurface operator O\u03a3 depends on 4M real parameters, where M is the number of U (1)'s left\n\nunbroken by O\u03a3 . Surface operators are a higher dimensional generalization of Wilson and 't\nHooft operators, which are supported on curves and induce a codimension three singularity\nfor the classical fields appearing in the Lagrangian. In this paper we extend the bulk\ndescription of all half-BPS Wilson loop operators found in [5] (see also1 [8][9][10][11][12])\nto all half-BPS surface operators.\nWe find the asymptotically AdS5 \u00d7S5 solutions of Type IIB supergravity corresponding\n\nto all half-BPS surface operators O\u03a3 in N = 4 U (N ) SYM. The topology and geometry\n\nof the \"bubbling\" solution is completely determined in terms of some data, very much like\nin the case studied by Lin, Lunin and Maldacena (LLM) in the context of half-BPS local\noperators [13]2 . In fact, we identify the system of equations determining the supergravity\n\nsolution corresponding to the half-BPS surface operators in N = 4 SYM with that obtained\n\nby \"analytic\" continuation of the LLM equations [13][16].\n\nThe data determining the topology and geometry of a supergravity solution is characterized by the position of a collection of M point particles in a three dimensional space X,\nwhere X is a submanifold of the ten dimensional geometry. Different particle configurations\ngive rise to different asymptotically AdS5 \u00d7S5 geometries.\n\n1\n\nThe description of Wilson loops in the fundamental representation goes back to [6][7].\n\n2\n\nThe bubbling geometry description of half-BPS Wilson loops was found in [10][11] while that\n\nof half-BPS domain wall operators was found in [11][14]. For the bubbling Calabi-Yau geometries\nfor Wilson loops in Chern-Simons, see [15].\n\n1\n\n\fFig. 1: a) The metric and five-form flux is determined once the position of the\nparticles in X \u2013 labeled by coordinates (~\nxl , yl ) where y \u2265 0 \u2013 is given. The l-th\nparticle is associated with a point Pl \u2208 X. b) The configuration corresponding to\nthe AdS5 \u00d7S5 vacuum.\n\nEven though the choice of a particle distribution in X completely determines the\ngeometry and topology of the metric and the corresponding RR five-form field strength,\nfurther choices have to be made to fully characterize a solution of Type IIB supergravity\non this geometry3 .\nGiven a configuration of M particles in X, the corresponding ten dimensional geometry\ndevelops M non-trivial disks which end on the boundary4 of AdS5 \u00d7S5 on a non-contractible\n\nS1 . Since Type IIB supergravity has two two-form gauge fields, one from the NS-NS sector\nand one from the RR sector, a solution of the Type IIB supergravity equations of motion\nis fully determined only once the holonomy of the two-forms around the various disks is\nspecified:\n\nZ\n\nDl\n\nBNS\n2\u03c0\n\nZ\n\nDl\n\nBR\n2\u03c0\n\nl = 1, . . . , M.\n\n(1.1)\n\nTherefore, an asymptotically AdS5 \u00d7S5 solution depends on the position of the M particles\nin X \u2013 given by (~xl , yl ) \u2013 and on the holonomies of the two-forms (1.1).\n\nA precise dictionary is given between all the 4M parameters that label a half-BPS\nsurface operator O\u03a3 and all the parameters describing the corresponding supergravity\n\nsolution. We show that the supergravity solution describing a half-BPS surface operator is\nregular and that whenever the supergravity solution develops a singularity the N = 4 SYM\n\npath integral description of the corresponding surface operator also develops a singularity.\nWe study the action of the SL(2, Z) symmetry of Type IIB string theory on the\nsupergravity solutions representing the half-BPS surface operators in N = 4 SYM. By\n3\n\nThis is on top of the obvious choice of dilaton and axion, which gets identified with the\n\ncomplexified coupling constant in N = 4 SYM.\n4\n\nThe conformal boundary in this case is AdS3 \u00d7S1 , where surface operators in N = 4 SYM\n\ncan be studied by specifying non-trivial boundary conditions.\n\n2\n\n\fusing the proposed dictionary between the parameters of a supergravity solution and the\nparameters of the corresponding surface operator, we can show that the action of S-duality\ninduced on the parameters of a surface operator coincides with the recent proposal by\nGukov and Witten [4] in the framework of the gauge theory approach to the geometrical\nLanglands [17]5 with ramification.\nWhether surface operators can serve as novel order parameters in gauge theory remains\nan important open question. It is our hope that the viewpoint on these operators provided\nby the supergravity solutions in this paper may help shed light on this crucial question.\nThe plan of the rest of the paper is as follows. In section 2 we study the gauge theory\nsingularities corresponding to surface operators in N = 4 SYM, study the symmetries\npreserved by a half-BPS surface operator and review the proposal in [4] for the action of\nS-duality on the parameters that a half-BPS surface operator depends on. We also compute\nthe scaling weight of these operators and show that it is invariant under Montonen-Olive\nduality. In section 3 we construct the solutions of Type IIB supergravity describing the\nhalf-BPS surface operators. We identify all the parameters that a surface operator depends\non in the supergravity solution and show that the action of S-duality on surface operators\nproposed in [4] follows from the action of SL(2, Z) on the classical solutions of supergravity.\nThe Appendices contain some details omitted in the main text.\n\n2. Surface Operators in Gauge Theories\nA surface operator O\u03a3 is labeled by a surface \u03a3 in R1,3 and by a conjugacy class U of\n\nthe gauge group G. The data that characterizes a surface operator O\u03a3 , the surface \u03a3 and\n\nthe conjugacy class U , can be identified with that of an external string used to probe the\ntheory. The surface \u03a3 corresponds to the worldsheet of a string while the conjugacy class\nU is associated to the Aharonov-Bohm phase acquired by a charged particle encircling the\nstring.\nThe singularity6 in the gauge field produced by a surface operator is that of a nonabelian vortex. This singularity in the gauge field can be characterized by the phase\n5\n\nSee e.g. [18] for a review of the geometric Langlands program.\n\n6\n\nPrevious work involving codimension two singularities in gauge theory include [19][20][21].\n\n3\n\n\facquired by a charged particle circumnavigating around the string. This gives rise to a\ngroup element7 U \u2282 U (N )\n\nU \u2261 P exp i\n\nI\n\nA \u2282 U (N ),\n\n(2.1)\n\nwhich corresponds to the Aharonov-Bohm phase picked up by the wavefunction of the\ncharged particle. Since gauge transformations act by conjugation U \u2192 gU g \u22121 , a surface\n\noperator is labeled by a conjugacy class of the gauge group.\n\nBy performing a gauge transformation, the matrix U can be diagonalized. If we\ndemand that the gauge field configuration is scale invariant \u2013 so that O\u03a3 has a well defined\n\nscaling weight \u2013 then the gauge field produced by a surface operator can then be written\nas\n\uf8eb\u03b1 \u22971\n0\n...\n1\nN1\n0\n\u03b12 \u2297 1N2 . . .\n\uf8ec\nA=\uf8ec\n.\n..\n..\n\uf8ed\n..\n.\n.\n0\n0\n. . . \u03b1M\n\n0\n0\n..\n.\n\u2297 1NM\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7 d\u03b8,\n\uf8f8\n\n(2.2)\n\nwhere \u03b8 is the polar angle in the R2 \u2282 R1,3 plane normal to \u03a3 and 1n is the n-dimensional\n\nunit matrix. We note that the matrix U takes values on the maximal torus T N = RN /Z N\n\nof the U (N ) gauge group. Therefore the parameters \u03b1i take values on a circle of unit\nradius.\nThe surface operator corresponding to (2.2) spontaneously breaks the U (N ) gauge\nsymmetry along \u03a3 down to the so called Levi group L, where a group of Levi type is charQM\nacterized by the subgroup of U (N ) that commutes with (2.2). Therefore, L = l=1 U (Nl ),\nPM\nwhere N = l=1 Nl .\nQM\nSince the gauge group is broken down to the Levi group L = l=1 U (Nl ) along \u03a3,\nthere is a further choice [4] in the definition of O\u03a3 consistent with the symmetries and\n\nequations of motion. This corresponds to turning on a two dimensional \u03b8-angle for the\nunbroken U (1)'s along the string worldsheet \u03a3. The associated operator insertion into the\nN = 4 SYM path integral is given by:\nexp i\n\nM\nX\n\n\u03b7l\n\n\u03a3\n\nl=1\n\n7\n\nZ\n\nTr Fl\n\n!\n\n.\n\n(2.3)\n\nWe now focus on G = U (N ) as it is the relevant gauge group for describing string theory\n\nwith asymptotically AdS5 \u00d7S5 boundary conditions.\n\n4\n\n\fThe parameters \u03b7i takes values in the maximal torus of the S-dual or Langlands dual\ngauge group L G [4]. Therefore, since L G = U (N ) for G = U (N ), we have that the matrix\nQM\nof \u03b8-angles of a surface operator O\u03a3 characterized by the Levi group L = l=1 U (Nl ) is\n\ngiven by the L-invariant matrix:\n\n\uf8eb\u03b7 \u2297 1\n0\n...\n1\nN1\n0\n\u03b72 \u2297 1N2 . . .\n\uf8ec\n\u03b7=\uf8ec\n.\n..\n..\n\uf8ed\n..\n.\n.\n0\n0\n. . . \u03b7M\n\n0\n0\n..\n.\n\u2297 1NM\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7.\n\uf8f8\n\n(2.4)\n\nThe parameters \u03b7i , being two dimensional \u03b8-angles, also take values on a circle of unit\nradius.\nQM\n\nTherefore, a surface operator O\u03a3 in pure gauge theory with Levi group L =\n\nl=1\n\nU (Nl ) is labeled by 2M L-invariant parameters (\u03b1l , \u03b7l ) up to the action of SM ,\n\nwhich acts by permuting the different eigenvalues in (2.2) and (2.4). The operator is then\ndefined by expanding the path integral with the insertion of the operator (2.3) around\nthe singularity (2.2), and by integrating over connections that are smooth near \u03a3. In\nperforming the path integral, we must divide [4] by the gauge transformations that take\nQM\nvalues in L = l=1 U (Nl ) when restricted to \u03a3. This means that the operator becomes\n\nsingular whenever the unbroken gauge symmetry near \u03a3 gets enhanced, corresponding to\nwhen eigenvalues in (2.2) and (2.4) coincide.\nSurface Operators in N = 4 SYM\nIn a gauge theory with extra classical fields like N = 4 SYM, the surface operator O\u03a3\n\nmay produce a singularity for the extra fields near the location of the surface operator.\nThe only requirement is that the singular field configuration solves the equations of motion\nof the theory away8 from the surface \u03a3. The global symmetries imposed on the operator\nO\u03a3 determine which classical fields in the Lagrangian develop a singularity near \u03a3 together\n\nwith the type of singularity.\n\nA complementary viewpoint on surface operators is to add new degrees of freedom on\nthe surface \u03a3. Such an approach to surface operators in N = 4 SYM has been considered\n8\n\nFor pure gauge theory, the field configuration in (2.2) does satisfy the Yang-Mills equation\n\nof motion Dm F mn = 0 away from \u03a3. Moreover, adding the two dimensional \u03b8-angles (2.3) does\nnot change the equations of motion.\n\n5\n\n\fin [22][23] where the new degrees of freedom arise from localized open strings on a brane\nintersection.\nThe basic effect of O\u03a3 is to generate an Aharonov-Bohm phase corresponding to a\n\ngroup element U (2.1). If we let z be the complex coordinate in the R2 \u2282 R1,3 plane\nnormal to \u03a3, the singularity in the gauge field configuration is then given by\nAz =\n\nk\nX\nAI\nI=1\n\nzI\n\n,\n\n(2.5)\n\nwhere AI are constant matrices. Scale invariance of the singularity \u2013 which we are going\nto impose \u2013 restricts AI = 0 for I \u2265 2.\n\nThe operator O\u03a3 can also excite a complex scalar field \u03a6 of N = 4 SYM near \u03a3\n\nwhile preserving half of the Poincare supersymmetries of N = 4 SYM. Imposing that the\nsingularity is scale invariant9 yields\n\n\u03a6=\n\n\u03a61\n,\nz\n\n(2.6)\n\nwhere \u03a61 is a constant matrix.\nA surface operator O\u03a3 is characterized by the choice of an unbroken gauge group\n\nL \u2282 G along \u03a3. Correspondingly, the singularity of all the fields excited by O\u03a3 must be\nQM\ninvariant under the unbroken gauge group L.

If we consider the surface \u03a3 = R1,1 \u2282 R1,3 , then \u03a3 breaks the SO(2, 4)\n\nconformal group to a subgroup. A surface operator O\u03a3 supported on this surface inserts\n\ninto the gauge theory a static probe string. This surface is manifestly invariant under\n\nrotations and translations in \u03a3 and scale transformations. It is also invariant under the\naction of inversion I : x\u03bc \u2192 x\u03bc /x2 and consequently11 invariant under special conformal\ntransformations in \u03a3. Therefore, the symmetries left unbroken by \u03a3 = R1,1 generate\n\nan SO(2, 2) \u00d7 SO(2)23 subgroup of the SO(2, 4) conformal group, where SO(2)23 rotates\nthe plane transverse to \u03a3 in R1,3 . In Euclidean signature, the surface \u03a3 =S2 preserves\n\nan SO(1, 3) \u00d7 SO(2)23 subgroup of the Euclidean conformal group. This surface can be\nobtained from the surface \u03a3 = R2 \u2208 R4 by the action of a broken special conformal\n\ngenerator and can also be used to construct a half-BPS surface operator O\u03a3 in N = 4\n\nSYM.\n\nSince the symmetry of a surface operator with \u03a3 = R1,1 is SO(2, 2) \u00d7 SO(2)23 one\n\ncan study such an operator either by considering the gauge theory in R1,3 or in AdS3 \u00d7S1 ,\n\nwhich can be obtained from R1,3 by a conformal transformation. Studying the gauge\n\ntheory in AdS3 \u00d7S1 has the advantage of making the symmetries of the surface operator\n\nmanifest, as the conformal symmetries left unbroken by the surface act by isometries on\nAdS3 \u00d7S1 . Surface operators in R1,3 are described by a codimension two singularity while\n\nsurface operators in AdS3 \u00d7S1 are described by a boundary condition on the boundary of\nAdS3 . A surface operator with \u03a3 = R1,1 corresponds to a boundary condition on AdS3\n\nin Poincare coordinates while a surface operator on \u03a3 =S2 corresponds to a boundary\ncondition on global Euclidean AdS3 .\n11\n\nWe recall that a special conformal transformation K\u03bc is generated by IP\u03bc I, where P\u03bc is the\n\ntranslation generator and I is an inversion.\n\n8\n\n\fThe singularity in the classical fields produced by O\u03a3 in (2.2)(2.7) is also invariant\n\nunder SO(2, 2). The N = 4 scalar field \u03a6 carries charge under an SO(2)R subgroup of the\nSO(6) R-symmetry and is therefore SO(4) invariant. The surface operator O\u03a3 is therefore\n\ninvariant under SO(2, 2)\u00d7SO(2)a \u00d7SO(4), where SO(2)a is generated by the anti-diagonal\n\nproduct12 of SO(2)23 \u00d7 SO(2)R .\n\nN = 4 SYM has sixteen Poincare supersymmetries and sixteen conformal super-\n\nsymmetries, generated by ten dimensional Majorana-Weyl spinors \u01eb1 and \u01eb2 of opposite\nchirality. As shown in the Appendix A, the surface operator O\u03a3 for \u03a3 = R1,1 preserves\n\nhalf of the Poincare and half of the conformal supesymmetries13 and is therefore half-BPS.\nWith the aid of these symmetries we study in the next section the gravitational description of half-BPS surface operators in N = 4 SYM.\nScaling Weight of half-BPS Surface Operators in N = 4 SYM\nConformal symmetry constraints the form of the OPE of the energy-energy tensor\n\nTmn with the operators in the theory.

Bubbling Surface Operators\nIn this section we find the dual gravitational description of the half-BPS surface operators O\u03a3 described in the previous section. The bulk description is given in terms of\n\nasymptotically AdS5 \u00d7S5 and singularity free solutions of the Type IIB supergravity equa-\n\ntions of motion. The data from which the solution is uniquely determined encodes the\ncorresponding data about the surface operator O\u03a3 .\n\nThe strategy to obtain these solutions is to make an ansatz for Type IIB supergravity\n\nwhich is invariant under all the symmetries preserved by the half-BPS surface operators\nO\u03a3 . As discussed in the previous section, the bosonic symmetries preserved by a half-\n\nBPS surface operator O\u03a3 are SO(2, 2) \u00d7 SO(4) \u00d7 SO(2)a . Therefore the most general\n\nten dimensional metric invariant under these symmetries can be constructed by fibering\n\nAdS3 \u00d7S3 \u00d7S1 over a three manifold X, where the symmetries act by isometries on the\n\nfiber. The constraints imposed by unbroken supersymmetry on the ansatz are obtained by\ndemanding that the ansatz for the supergravity background possesses a sixteen component\n14\n\nContact terms depending on \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3 and proportional to the derivative of the two-dimensional\n\n\u03b4-function appear when evaluating the on-shelll energy-momentum tensor. It would be interesting\nto understand the physical content of these contact terms.\n\n10\n\n\fKilling spinor, which means that the background solves the Killing spinor equations of Type\nIIB supergravity. A solution of the Killing spinor equations and the Bianchi identity for the\nfive-form field strength guarantee that the full set of equations of Type IIB supergravity\nare satisfied and that a half-BPS solution has been obtained.\nThe problem of solving the Killing spinor equations of Type IIB supergravity with\nan SO(2, 2) \u00d7 SO(4) \u00d7 SO(2)a symmetry can be obtained by analytic continuation of the\nequations studied by LLM [13][16], which found the supergravity solutions describing the\nhalf-BPS local operators of N = 4 SYM, which have an SO(4)\u00d7SO(4)\u00d7R symmetry. The\n\nequations determining the metric and five-form flux can be read from [13][16], in which the\nanalytic continuation that we need to construct the gravitational description of half-BPS\nsurface operators O\u03a3 was considered.\n\nThe ten dimensional metric and five-form flux is completely determined in terms of\n\ndata that needs to be specified on the three manifold X in the ten dimensional space. An\nasymptotically AdS5 \u00d7S5 metric is uniquely determined in terms of a function z(x1 , x2 , y),\n\nwhere (x1 , x2 , y) \u2261 (~x, y) are coordinates in X. The ten dimensional metric in the Einstein\n\nframe is given by15\nr\nr\n\u221a\n2y\n2z + 1 2\n2z \u2212 1\n4z 2 \u2212 1\n2\n2\ndsAdS3 + y\nd\u03a93 + \u221a\n(dy 2 + dxi dxi ),\n(d\u03c7 + V ) +\nds = y\n2\n2z \u2212 1\n2z + 1\n2y\n4z \u2212 1\n(3.1)\n\nwhere ds2X = dy 2 + dxi dxi with y \u2265 0 and V is a one-form in X satisfying dV = 1/y \u2217X dz.\n\nAdS3 in Poincare coordinate corresponds to a surface operator on \u03a3 = R1,1 while AdS3\n\nin global Euclidean coordinate corresponds to a surface operator on \u03a3 =S2 . The U (1)a\nsymmetry acts by shifts on \u03c7 while SO(2, 2) and SO(4) act by isometries on the coordinates\nof AdS3 and S3 respectively.\nA non-trivial solution to the equations of motion is obtained by specifying a configuration of M point-like particles in X. The data from which the solution is determined\nis the \"charge\" Ql of the particles together with their positions (~xl , yl ) in X (see Figure\n1). Given a \"charge\" distribution, the function z(x1 , x2 , y) solves the following differential\nequation:\n\u2202i \u2202i z(x1 , x2 , y) + y\u2202y\n15\n\n\u0012\n\n\u2202y z(x1 , x2 , y)\ny\n\n\u0013\n\n=\n\nM\nX\nl=1\n\nQl \u03b4(y \u2212 yl )\u03b4 (2) (~x \u2212 ~xl ).\n\n(3.2)\n\nThe \"analytic\" continuation from the bubbling geometries dual to the half-BPS local opera-\n\ntors is given by z \u2192 z, t \u2192 \u03c7, y \u2192 \u2212iy, ~\nx \u2192 i~\nx, d\u03a93 \u2192 \u2212ds2AdS3 [13][16].\n\n11\n\n\fIntroducing a \"charge\" at the point (~xl , yl ) in X has the effect of shrinking16 the\nS1 with coordinate \u03c7 in (3.1) to zero size at that point. In order for this to occur in a\nsmooth fashion the magnitude of the \"charge\" has to be fixed [13][16] so that Ql = 2\u03c0yl .\nTherefore, the independent data characterizing the metric and five-form of the solution is\nthe position of the M \"charges\", given by (~xl , yl ).\nIn summary, a smooth half-BPS SO(2, 2) \u00d7 SO(4) \u00d7 SO(2)a invariant asymptotically\n\nAdS5 \u00d7S5 metric (3.1) solving the Type IIB supergravity equations of motion is found by\n\nsolving (3.2) subject to the boundary condition z(x1 , x2 , 0) = 1/2 [13][16], so that the S3\nin (3.1) shrinks in a smooth way at y = 0. The function z(x1 , x2 , y) is given by\nM\n\nz(x1 , x2 , y) =\n\n1 X\n+\nzl (x1 , x2 , y),\n2\n\n(3.3)\n\nl=1\n\nwhere\n1\n(~x \u2212 ~xl )2 + y 2 + yl2\n\u2212\n,\nzl (x1 , x2 , y) = p\n2\n2 ((~x \u2212 ~xl )2 + y 2 + yl2 )2 \u2212 4yl2 y 2\n\n(3.4)\n\nand V can be computed from z(x1 , x2 , y) from dV = 1/y \u2217X dz. Both the metric and\nfive-form field strength are determined by an integer M and by (~xl , yl ) for l = 1, . . . , M .\nTopology of Bubbling Solutions And Two-form Holonomies\nThe asymptotically AdS5 \u00d7S5 solutions constructed from (3.3)(3.4) are topologically\n\nquite rich. In particular, a solution with M point \"charges\" has M topologically non-trivial\nS5 's. We can associate to each point Pl \u2208 X a corresponding five-sphere S5l . S5l can be\n\nconstructed by fibering the S1 \u00d7S3 in the geometry (3.1) over a straight line between the\npoint (~xl , 0) and the point (~xl , yl ) in X. The topology of this manifold is indeed an S5 ,\n\nas an S5 can be represented17 by an S1 \u00d7S3 fibration over an interval where the S1 and S3\nshrink to zero size at opposite ends of the interval, which is what happens in our geometry\nwhere the S3 shrinks at (~xl , 0) while the S1 shrinks at the other endpoint (~xl , yl ).\n16\n\nNear y = yl the form of the relevant part of the metric is that of the Taub-NUT space. Fixing\n\nthe value of the \"charge\" at y = yl by imposing regularity of the metric coincides with the usual\nregularity constraint on the periodicity of the circle in Taub-NUT space.\n17\n\nThis can be seen explicitly by writing d\u03a95 = cos2 \u03b8d\u03a93 + d\u03b8 2 + sin2 \u03b8d\u03c62 .\n\n12\n\n\fFig. 2: A topologically non-trivial S5 can be constructed by fibering S1 \u00d7S3 over\nan interval connecting the y = 0 plane and the location of the \"charge\" at the\npoint Pl \u2208 X with (~\nxl , yl ) coordinates.\n\nFollowing [13][16] we can now integrate the five-form flux over the topologically nontrivial S5 's (see Appendix B):\n1\n\u03c03\n\nZ\n\nSl5\n\nF5 = yl2 .\n\n(3.5)\n\nSince flux has to be quantized, the position in the y-axis of the l-th particle in X is also\nquantized\nyl2 = 4\u03c0Nl lp4\n\nNl \u2208 Z,\n\n(3.6)\n\nwhere lp is the ten dimensional Planck length. For an asymptotically AdS5 \u00d7S5 geometry\n\nwith radius of curvature R4 = 4\u03c0N lp4 , which is dual to N = 4 U (N ) SYM, we have that\nthe total amount of five-form flux must be N :\nN=\n\nM\nX\n\nNl .\n\n(3.7)\n\nl=1\n\nThe asymptotically AdS5 \u00d7S5 solutions constructed from (3.3)(3.4) also contain non-\n\ntrivial surfaces. In particular, a solution with M point \"charges\" has M non-trivial disks\nDl . Just as in the case of the S5 's, we can associate to each point Pl \u2208 X a disk Dl .\n\nInspection of the asymptotic form of the metric (3.1) given in (3.3)(3.4) reveals that\n\nthe metric is conformal to AdS3 \u00d7S1 . This geometry on the boundary of AdS5 \u00d7S5 , which\n\nis where the dual N = 4 U (N ) SYM lives, is the natural background geometry on which to\n\nstudy conformally invariant surface operators in N = 4 SYM. As explained in section 2, an\nSO(2, 2) \u00d7 SO(2)23 invariant surface operator can be defined by specifying a codimension\n\ntwo singularity in R1,3 or by specifying appropriate boundary conditions for the classical\nfields in the gauge theory at the boundary of AdS3 \u00d7S1 . In the latter formulation, the\nworldsheet of the surface operator \u03a3 is the boundary of AdS3 .\n13\n\n\fTherefore, in the boundary of AdS5 \u00d7S5 we have a non-contractible S1 . If we fiber the\n\nS1 parametrized by \u03c7 in (3.1) over a straight line connecting a point (~xl , yl ) in X \u2013 where\nthe S1 shrinks to zero size \u2013 to a point in X corresponding to the boundary of AdS5 \u00d7S5\n\n\u2013 given by ~x, y \u2192 \u221e \u2013 we obtain a surface Dl . This surface is topologically a disk18 and\n\nthere are M of them for a \"charge\" distribution of M particles in X.\n\nFig. 3: A disk D can be constructed by fibering S1 over an interval connecting\nthe \"charge\" at the point Pl \u2208 X with (~\nxl , yl ) coordinates and the boundary of\nAdS5 \u00d7S5 .\n\nDue to the existence of the disks Di , the supergravity solution given by the metric\nand five-form flux alone is not unique. Type IIB supergravity has a two-form gauge field\nfrom the NS-NS sector and another one from the RR sector. In order to fully specify a\nsolution of Type IIB supergravity in the bubbling geometry (3.1) we must complement the\nmetric and the five-form with the integral of the two-forms around the disks19\nZ\nZ\nBR\nBNS\n\u03b7l =\nl = 1, . . . , M,\n\u03b1l = \u2212\nDl 2\u03c0\nDl 2\u03c0\n\n(3.8)\n\nwhere we have used notation conducive to the later comparison with the parameters characterizing a half-BPS surface operator O\u03a3 . Since both BNS and BR are invariant under\n\nlarge gauge transformations, the parameters (\u03b1l , \u03b7l ) take values on a circle of unit radius.\nApart from the M disks Dl , the bubbling geometry constructed from (3.3)(3.4) also\nhas topologically non-trivial S2 's. One can construct an S2 by fibering the S1 in (3.1) over\n18\n\nSuch disks also appear in the study of the high temperature regime of N = 4 SYM, where\n\nthe bulk geometry [25] is the AdS Schwarzschild black hole, which also has a non-contractible S1\nin the boundary which is contractible in the full geometry.\n19\n\nThe overall signs in the identification are fixed by demanding consistent action of S-duality\n\nof N = 4 SYM with that of Type IIB supergravity.\n\n14\n\n\fa straight line connecting the points Pl and Pm in X. Since the S1 shrinks to zero size in\na smooth manner at the endpoints we obtain an S2 . Therefore, to every pair of \"charges\"\nin X, characterized by different points Pl and Pm in X, we can construct a corresponding\nS2 , which we label by S2l,m . The integral of BNS and BR over S2l,m do not give rise to new\nparameters, since [S2l,m ] = [Dl ] \u2212 [Dm ] in homology, and the periods can be determined\nfrom (3.8).\n\nFig. 4: An S2 can be constructed by fibering S1 over an interval connecting the\n\"charge\" at the point Pl \u2208 X with a different \"charge\" at point Pm \u2208 X.\n\nBubbling Geometries as Surface Operators\nAs we discussed in section 2, a surface operator O\u03a3 is characterized by an unbroken\n\ngauge group L \u2208 U (N ) along together with 4M L-invariant parameters (\u03b1l , \u03b2l , \u03b3l , \u03b7l ). On\n\nthe other hand, the Type IIB supergravity solutions we have described depend on the\npositions (~xl , yl ) of M \"charged\" particles in X and the two-form holonomies:\nZ\nZ\nBR\nBNS\n.\nDl 2\u03c0\nDl 2\u03c0\n\n(3.9)\n\nWe now establish an explicit dictionary between the parameters in gauge theory and the\nparameters in supergravity.\nFor illustration purposes, it is convenient to start by considering the half-BPS surface\noperator O\u03a3 with the largest Levi group L, which is L = U (N ) for G = U (N ). U (N )\n\ninvariance requires that the singularity in the fields produced by O\u03a3 take values in the\n\ncenter of U (N ). Therefore, the gauge field and scalar field produced by O\u03a3 is given by\nA = \u03b10 1N d\u03b8\n1\n\u03a6 = \u221a (\u03b20 + i\u03b30 )1N ,\n2z\n15\n\n(3.10)\n\n\fwhere 1N is the identity matrix. We can also turn a two-dimensional \u03b8-angle (2.3) for the\noverall U (1), so that:\n\u03b7 = \u03b70 1N .\n\n(3.11)\n\nWe now identify this operator with the supergravity solution obtained by having a\nsingle point \"charge\" source in X (see Figure 1b). If we let the position of the \"charge\"\nbe (~x0 , y0 ) then\n(~x \u2212 ~x0 )2 + y 2 + y02\nz(x1 , x2 , y) = p\n2 ((~x \u2212 ~x0 )2 + y 2 + y02 )2 \u2212 4y02 y 2\n\n(xJ \u2212 xJ0 )((~x \u2212 ~x0 )2 + y 2 \u2212 y02 )\np\nVI = \u2212\u01ebIJ\n,\n2(~x \u2212 ~x0 )2 ((~x \u2212 ~x0 )2 + y 2 + y02 )2 \u2212 4y02 y 2\n\n(3.12)\n\nwhere V = VI dxI . The metric (3.1) obtained using (3.12) is the metric of AdS5 \u00d7S5 . This\ncan be seen by the following change of variables [16]\n\nx1 \u2212 x10 + i(x2 \u2212 x20 ) = rei(\u03c8+\u03c6)\nr = y0 sinh u sin \u03b8\ny = y0 cosh u cos \u03b8\n1\n\u03c7 = (\u03c8 \u2212 \u03c6),\n2\n\n(3.13)\n\nwhich yields the AdS5 \u00d7S5 metric with AdS5 foliated by AdS3 \u00d7S1 slices:\n\u0002\n\u0003\nds2 = y0 (cosh2 uds2AdS3 + du2 + sinh2 ud\u03c8 2 ) + (cos2 \u03b8d\u03a93 + d\u03b8 2 + sin2 \u03b8d\u03c62 ) .\n\n(3.14)\n\nWe note that the U (1)a symmetry of the metric (3.1) \u2013 which acts by shifts on \u03c7 \u2013 identifies\nvia (3.13) an SO(2)R subgroup of the the SO(6) symmetry of the S5 , acting by shifts on\n\u03c6, with an SO(2)23 subgroup of the SO(2, 4) isometry group of AdS5 , acting by opposite\nshifts on \u03c8. This is precisely the same combination of generators discussed in section 2\nthat is preserved by a half-BPS surface operator O\u03a3 in N = 4 SYM.\n\nThe radius of curvature of AdS5 \u00d7S5 in (3.14) is given by R4 = y02 . Therefore using\n\nthat R4 = 4\u03c0N lp4 , where N is the rank of the N = 4 YM theory, we have that\nN=\n\ny02\n,\n4\u03c0lp4\n\n(3.15)\n\nand the position of the \"charge\" in y gets identified with the rank of the unbroken gauge\ngroup and is therefore quantized.\n16\n\n\fThe residue of the pole in \u03a6 (3.10) gets identified with the position of the \"charge\" in\nthe ~x-plane. It follows from (3.1) that the coordinates ~x and y have dimensions of length2 .\nTherefore, we identify the residue of the pole of \u03a6 with the position of the \"charge\" in the\n~x-plane in X via:\n(\u03b20 , \u03b30 ) =\n\n~x0\n.\n2\u03c0ls2\n\n(3.16)\n\nUnlike the position in y, the position in ~x is not quantized.\nThe remaining parameters of the surface operator O\u03a3 with U (N ) Levi group \u2013 given\n\nby (\u03b10 , \u03b70 ) \u2013 get identified with the holonomy of the two-forms of Type IIB supergravity\nover D\n\u03b10 = \u2212\n\nZ\n\nD\n\nBNS\n2\u03c0\n\n\u03b70 =\n\nZ\n\nD\n\nBR\n,\n2\u03c0\n\n(3.17)\n\nwhere D is the disk ending on the AdS5 \u00d7S5 boundary on the S1 . This identification\n\nproperly accounts for the correct periodicity of these parameters, which take values on a\ncircle of unit radius.\n\nThe path integral which defines a half-BPS surface operator O\u03a3 when L = U (N )\n\nis never singular as the gauge symmetry cannot be further enhanced by changing the\nparameters (\u03b10 , \u03b20 , \u03b30 , \u03b70 ) of the surface operator. Correspondingly, the dual supergravity\nsolution with one \"charge\" also never acquires a singularity by changing the parameters\nof the solution.\nLet's now consider the most general half-BPS surface operator O\u03a3 . First we need\n\nto characterize the operator by its Levi group, which for a U (N ) gauge group takes the\nQM\nPM\nform l=1 U (Nl ) with N = l=1 Nl = N . The operator then depends on 4M L-invariant\nparameters (\u03b1l , \u03b2l , \u03b3l , \u03b7l ) for l = 1. . . . , M up to the action of SM , which acts by permuting\n\nthe parameters.\nThe corresponding supergravity solution associated to such an operator is given by\nthe metric (3.1). The number of unbroken gauge group factors \u2013 given by the integer M \u2013\ncorresponds to the number of point \"charges\" in (3.2). For M > 1, the metric that follows\nfrom (3.3)(3.4) is AdS5 \u00d7S5 only asymptotically and not globally.\n\nThe rank of the various gauge group factors in the Levi group\n\nQM\n\nl=1\n\nU (Nl ) \u2013 given by\n\nthe integers Nl \u2013 correspond to the position of the \"charges\" along y \u2208 X, given by the\ncoordinates yl . The precise identification follows from (3.5)(3.6):\nNl =\n\nyl2\n4\u03c0lp4\n\nl = 1, . . . , M.\n17\n\n(3.18)\n\n\fNl also corresponds to the amount of five-form flux over S5l , the S5 associated with the\nl-th point charge:\n\n1\nNl =\n4\u03c0 4 lp4\n\nZ\n\nF5\n\nl = 1, . . . , M.\n\n(3.19)\n\nSl5\n\nThis identification quantizes the y coordinate in X into lp size bits. Thus length is quantized as opposed to area, which is what happens for the geometry dual to the half-BPS\nlocal operators [13][16], where it can be interpreted as the quantization of phase space in\nthe boundary gauge theory.\nA half-BPS surface operator O\u03a3 develops a pole for the scalar field \u03a6 (2.7). The\n\npole is characterized by its residue, which is given by 2M real parameters (\u03b2l , \u03b3l ). These\nparameters are identified with the position of the M \"charges\" in the ~x-plane in X via:\n(\u03b2l , \u03b3l ) =\n\n~xl\n.\n2\u03c0ls2\n\n(3.20)\n\nAll these parameters take values on the real line.\nThe remaining parameters characterizing a half-BPS surface operator O\u03a3 are the\n\nperiodic variables (\u03b1l , \u03b7l ), which determine the holonomy produced by O\u03a3 and the corre-\n\nsponding two-dimensional \u03b8-angles. These parameters get identified with the holonomy of\nthe two-forms of Type IIB supergravity over the M non-trivial disks Dl that the geometry\ngenerates in the presence of M \"charges\" in X:\nZ\nBNS\n\u03b1l = \u2212\nDl 2\u03c0\nZ\nBR\n.\n\u03b7l =\nDl 2\u03c0\n\n(3.21)\n\nThe identification respects the periodicity of (\u03b1l , \u03b7l ), which in supergravity arises from the\ninvariance of BNS and BR under large gauge transformations20 .\nWe have given a complete dictionary between all the parameters that a half-BPS\nsurface operator in N = 4 SYM depends on and all the parameters in the corresponding\n\nbubbling geometry. We note that a surface operator O\u03a3 depends on a set of parameters\n\nup to the action of the permutation group SM on the parameters, which is part of the\nU (N ) gauge symmetry. The corresponding statement in supergravity is that the solution\ndual to a surface operator is invariant under the action of SM , which acts by permuting\nthe \"charges\" in X.\n20\n\nSince the gauge invariant variables are e\n\ni\n\nR\n\nB\nD 2\u03c0\n\n18\n\n.\n\n\fThe supergravity solution is regular as long as the \"charges\" do not collide. A singularity arises whenever two point \"charges\" in X coincide (see Figure 1):\n(~xl , yl ) \u2192 (~xm , ym )\n\nfor l 6= m.\n\n(3.22)\n\nWhenever this occurs, there is a reduction in the number of independent disks since (see\nFigure 3):\nDl \u2192 Dm\nand therefore\n\nfor l 6= m,\n\nZ\nBNS\n\u2192\nDl 2\u03c0\nD\nZ m\nZ\nBR\n\u2192\nDm\nDl 2\u03c0\n\nZ\n\nBNS\n2\u03c0\nBR\n2\u03c0\n\n(3.23)\n\n(3.24)\nfor l 6= m.\n\nIn this limit of parameter space the non-trivial S2 connecting the points Pl and Pm in X\nshrinks to zero size as [S2l,m ] = [Dl ] \u2212 [Dm ] \u2192 0, and the geometry becomes singular.\n\nBy using the dictionary developed in this paper, such a singular geometry corresponds\n\nto a limit when two of each of the set of parameters (\u03b1l , \u03b2l , \u03b3l , \u03b7l ) defining a half-BPS surface\noperator O\u03a3 become equal:\n\u03b1l \u2192 \u03b1m , \u03b2l \u2192 \u03b2m , \u03b3l \u2192 \u03b3m , \u03b7l \u2192 \u03b7m\n\nfor l 6= m.\n\n(3.25)\n\nIn this limit the unbroken gauge group preserved by the surface operator O\u03a3 is enhanced\nQM\nto L\u2032 from the original Levi group l=1 U (Nl ), where L \u2282 L\u2032 . As explained in section 2\nthe path integral from which O\u03a3 is defined becomes singular.\n\nIn summary, we have found the description of all half-BPS surface operators O\u03a3 in\n\nN = 4 SYM in terms of solutions of Type IIB supergravity. The asymptotically AdS5 \u00d7S5\n\nsolutions are regular and when they develop a singularity then the corresponding operator\nalso becomes singular.\nS-Duality of Surface Operators from Type IIB Supergravity\nThe group of dualities of N = 4 SYM acts non-trivially [4] on surface operators O\u03a3\n\n(see discussion in section 2). For G = U (N ) the duality group is SL(2, Z) and its proposed\naction on the parameters on which O\u03a3 depends on is [4]:\n(\u03b2l , \u03b3l ) \u2192 |c\u03c4 + d| (\u03b2l , \u03b3l )\n(\u03b1l , \u03b7l ) \u2192 (\u03b1l , \u03b7l )M\u22121 ,\n19\n\n(3.26)\n\n\fwhere M is an SL(2, Z) matrix\n\n\u0012\n\na b\nc d\n\n\u0013\n\n.\n\n(3.27)\n\nWe now reproduce21 this transformation law by studying the action of the SL(2, Z)\nsubgroup of the SL(2, R) classical symmetry of Type IIB supergravity, which is in fact the\nappropriate symmetry group of Type IIB string theory. For that we need to analyze the\naction of S-duality on our bubbling geometries.\nSL(2, Z) acts on the complex scalar \u03c4 = C0 + ie\u2212\u03c6 of Type IIB supergravity in the\nfamiliar fashion\na\u03c4 + b\n,\nc\u03c4 + d\n\n\u03c4\u2192\n\n(3.28)\n\nwhere as usual \u03c4 gets identified with the complexified coupling constant of N = 4 SYM\n\n(2.8). SL(2, Z) also rotates the two-form gauge fields22 of Type IIB supergravity\n\u0012\n\nBNS\nBR\n\n\u0013\n\n\u2192\n\n\u0012\n\nd c\nb a\n\n\u0013\u0012\n\nBNS\nBR\n\n\u0013\n\n,\n\n(3.29)\n\nwhile leaving the metric in the Einstein frame and the five-form flux invariant.\nGiven that the metric in (3.1) is in the Einstein frame, SL(2, Z) acts trivially on the\ncoordinates (~x, y). Nevertheless, since\nwith gs = e\u03c6\n\nls = gs\u22121/4 lp\n\n(3.30)\n\nthe string scale transforms under SL(2, Z) as follows:\nls2 \u2192\n\nls2\n.\n|c\u03c4 + d|\n\n(3.31)\n\nTherefore, under S-duality:\n~xl\n~xl\n\u2192 |c\u03c4 + d|\n.\n2\n2\u03c0ls\n2\u03c0ls2\n\n(3.32)\n\nGiven our dictionary in (3.20), we find that the surface operator parameters (\u03b2l , \u03b3l ) transform as in (3.26), agreeing with the proposal in [4].\n21\n\nIf we apply the same idea to the LLM geometries dual to half-BPS local operators in [13],\n\nwe conclude that the half-BPS local operators are invariant under S-duality.\n22\n\nSee e.g. [26][27].\n\n20\n\n\fThe identification of the rest of the parameters is (3.21):\n\u03b1l = \u2212\nZ\n\u03b7l =\n\nZ\n\nDl\n\nDl\n\nBNS\n2\u03c0\n\nBR\n.\n2\u03c0\n\n(3.33)\n\nUsing the action of SL(2, Z) on the two-forms (3.29) and the identification (3.33), it\nfollows from a straightforward manipulation that the surface operator paramaters (\u03b1l , \u03b7l )\ntransform as in (3.26), agreeing with the proposal in [4].\n\nAcknowledgements\nWe would like to thank Xiao Liu for very useful discussions.

Supersymmetry of Surface Operator in N =4 SYM\nIn this Appendix we study the Poincare and conformal supersymmetries preserved\nby a surface operator in N =4 SYM supported on R1,1 . These symmetries are generated\nby ten dimensional Majorana-Weyl spinors \u01eb1 and \u01eb2 of opposite chirality. We determine\nthe supersymmetries left unbroken by a surface operator by studying the supersymmetry\nvariation of the gaugino in the presence of the surface operator singularity in (2.2)(2.7).\nThe metric is given by:\nds2 = \u2212(dx0 )2 + (dx1 )2 + (dx2 )2 + (dx3 )2 = \u2212(dx0 )2 + (dx1 )2 + 2dzdz\u0304.\nwhere z =\n\n\u221a1 (x2\n2\n\n(A.1)\n\n+ ix3 ) = |z|ei\u03b8 , while the singularity in the fields is\n1\n\u03b2 + i\u03b3\n\u03a6\u03c9 = \u03a6\u03c9\u0304 = \u221a (\u03a68 + i\u03a69 ) = \u221a\n2\n2z\nA = \u03b1d\u03b8, F = dA = 2\u03c0\u03b1\u03b4D ,\n\n(A.2)\n\nwhere [\u03b1, \u03b2] = [\u03b1, \u03b3] = [\u03b2, \u03b3] = 0 and \u03b4D = d(d\u03b8) is a two form delta function.
