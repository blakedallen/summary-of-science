Meanwhile we are free to speculate whether nature is endowed with new physics beyond\nthe minimal Higgs framework with one scalar doublet, as incorporated in the standard model\n(SM). One of the simplest \u2013 and probably the most thoroughly studied \u2013 extension of the Higgs\nsector is the two-Higgs-doublet model (2HDM), in which the SM Higgs sector is duplicated\nby introduction of another doublet of SU(2)L [1]. The primary motivation for considering the\n2HDM is often sought in supersymmetry [2], since the minimal supersymmetric standard model\n(MSSM) requires at least two Higgs doublets in order to cancel gauge anomalies and keep the\nsuperpotential analytic. This second requirement fixes the pattern of Yukawa couplings at\ntree-level. Many interesting results [3\u20138] have also been obtained for more general two-Higgsdoublet models. These models can be thought of as effective theories for supersymmetric Higgs\nsectors beyond the MSSM (see e.g. [9] and references therein). In addition they provide a\ngeneric description for UV extensions of the SM that do not involve supersymmetry, but still\ncontain two Higgs doublets in the low-energy effective theory. Two-Higgs-doublet models of\nthe general form are the focus of the present work.\nThe additional scalar doublet in the 2HDM introduces new and interesting phenomenology,\nsuch as new sources of CP-violation, flavor-changing neutral currents (FCNC), the presence of\na charged Higgs boson, and possibly even a dark matter candidate [10]. In the Yukawa sector,\nthe additional doublet leads to a large number of couplings between fermions and scalars which\nare not fixed by the mass generation mechanism. When FCNCs are absent at tree-level, the\nmost striking phenomenological difference between the SM and the 2HDM Yukawa sectors is\nthe presence of a charged Higgs boson and its associated charged current. It is mainly through\nthis interaction the 2HDM can reveal its presence in low-energy observables, such as the decay\nrates of K, D, and B mesons, complementing searches for charged Higgs bosons at high-energy\ncolliders. Results on the 2HDM Yukawa sector are therefore useful in both these contexts.\nConstraints on the 2HDM parameters have been extensively studied in the literature, in\nparticular for the type II model [11] which is the form of the Yukawa sector in the MSSM at\ntree-level. For recent studies discussing flavor constraints on the charged Higgs boson in the\nMSSM, see [12]. To differentiate between the MSSM Higgs sector and a more general theory\nwith two Higgs doublets, it is interesting to identify differences in phenomenologically viable\nsignals, such as a charged Higgs boson contribution to flavor physics observables. Combining\nfuture LHC results with flavor physics could also be a means of testing the Yukawa couplings\nto more than one type and generation of fermions. To determine the reach in the flavor sector,\nwe extend the previous results for the 2HDM type II to flavor constraints in the more general\nsetting of arbitrary flavor-diagonal Yukawa couplings, i.e. with no assumptions of coupling\nuniversality between fermions of different types or generations. Limits on the relevant couplings\nare evaluated for each observable separately. As a special case, we then translate the general\nresults into constraints on the (mH + , tan \u03b2) plane for types I \u2013 IV [13] of the 2HDM with a Z2\nsymmetry.1\n1\n\nThe phenomenology of the more unusual models type III and IV, which have different couplings for the\ndown-type quarks and the leptons, has recently been studied in [14].\n\n2\n\n\fThe organization of this paper is as follows: in Section 2 we give a brief introduction to the\n2HDM, describing how the parameters of the potential are constrained by theoretical arguments\nand electroweak precision data. Following this discussion of the scalar sector, Section 3 deals\nwith the 2HDM Yukawa sector in some detail. The different flavor observables of interest are\nintroduced in Section 4, where also also our main results are presented as constraints on the\nindividual Yukawa couplings from each observable separately. In Section 5 we specialize the\ngeneral results of Section 4 to models with a Yukawa Z2 symmetry. Finally, Section 6 presents\nthe conclusions of this work.\n\n2\n\n2HDM Fundamentals\n\nIn a generic basis the most general, renormalizable, Higgs potential for two identical doublets\n\u03a61 and \u03a62 , with hypercharge Y = 1, is given by [4]\nh\ni\nV2HDM = m211 \u03a6\u20201 \u03a61 + m222 \u03a6\u20202 \u03a62 \u2212 m212 \u03a6\u20201 \u03a62 + h.c.\n\u00112 1 \u0010\n\u00112\n\u0010\n\u0011\u0010\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u0011\u0010\n\u0011\n1 \u0010\n+ \u03bb1 \u03a6\u20201 \u03a61 + \u03bb2 \u03a6\u20202 \u03a62 + \u03bb3 \u03a6\u20201 \u03a61 \u03a6\u20202 \u03a62 + \u03bb4 \u03a6\u20201 \u03a62 \u03a6\u20202 \u03a61\n2\n2\n\u001b\n\u001a\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u0011i \u0010\n\u0011\n\u0010\nh \u0010\n2\n1\n\u2020\n\u2020\n\u2020\n\u2020\n\u03bb5 \u03a61 \u03a62 + \u03bb6 \u03a61 \u03a61 + \u03bb7 \u03a62 \u03a62\n\u03a61 \u03a62 + h.c. .\n+\n2\n\n(1)\n\nIn total there are 14 free parameters in this model, including the complex phases which may be\npresent in \u03bb5,6,7 and m212 . Restricting ourselves to the case without CP violation, all parameters\nare assumed to be real, and the number of free parameters is reduced to 10. For the electroweak\n(EW) symmetry to be broken, the scalar mass matrix has at least one negative eigenvalue.\nAt the minimum,\nm211 and m222 can be eliminated in favor of the vacuum expectation values\n\u221a\nh\u03a6i i \u2261 vi / 2. The 2HDM is invariant under a unitary transformation of the scalar doublets\n[5,6]. A basis in the doublet space is chosen by specifying tan \u03b2 \u2261 v2 /v1 . The overall scale (like\nin the SM) is set by v 2 = v12 + v22 \u2243 (246 GeV)2 . For the sake of simplicity, we take \u03bb6 = \u03bb7 = 0\nin this section. This is required if the potential should respect a discrete Z2 symmetry imposed\non the \u03a6i fields.2 We will return to the importance of discrete symmetries later. The number\nof free parameters, v being fixed, is down to six (plus tan \u03b2 which specifies the basis).\nWhen the EW symmetry is broken, three of the eight scalar degrees of freedom are used for\nthe masses of the gauge bosons. The physical spectrum thus contains three neutral Higgs bosons\nand the charged Higgs pair H \u00b1 . Two of the neutrals are CP-even (h and H, with mh < mH ),\nand one (A) is CP-odd. The CP-even scalars mix with an angle \u03b1. At the minimum, the\noriginal doublets are expanded according to\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n\u221a\n\u0001\n+\n+\n2 G cos \u03b2 \u2212 H sin \u03b2\n1\n(2)\n\u03a61 = \u221a \uf8ed\n\u0001 \uf8f8\n0\n2\nv cos \u03b2 \u2212 h sin \u03b1 + H cos \u03b1 + i G cos \u03b2 \u2212 A sin \u03b2\n2\n\nThe Z2 symmetry can still be (softly) broken by dimension two terms for non-zero values of m212 .\n\n3\n\n\f\uf8eb\n\n\u221a\n\n+\n\n+\n\n\u0001\n\n\uf8f6\n\n2 G sin \u03b2 + H cos \u03b2\n1\n\u03a62 = \u221a \uf8ed\n\u0001 \uf8f8.\n2\nv sin \u03b2 + h cos \u03b1 + H sin \u03b1 + i G0 sin \u03b2 + A cos \u03b2\n\n(3)\n\nUsing the notation s\u03b2 \u2261 sin \u03b2, c\u03b2 \u2261 cos \u03b2, the tree-level Higgs masses are given in terms of the\nremaining potential parameters of Eq.

Working at tree-level, the mass relations allow the input parameters\n\u03bb1\u22125 to be substituted by the four Higgs masses and the neutral sector mixing sin(\u03b2 \u2212\u03b1), giving\na set of physical input parameters.\nThe parameters in Eq. (1) are bounded by the requirement that the potential is stable\n[15], i.e. that no direction in field space exists for which V \u2192 \u2212\u221e. Necessary and sufficient\nconditions for stability are given by\np\n\u03bb1 > 0,\n\u03bb2 > 0,\n\u03bb3 > \u2212 \u03bb1 \u03bb2 ,\np\n\u03bb3 + \u03bb4 \u2212 |\u03bb5 | > \u2212 \u03bb1 \u03bb2 .\n\nThe parameters can also be bounded from above by arguments of perturbativity and perturbative unitarity of the S-matrix for Higgs and longitudinal vector boson scattering [16]. We\nconsider the upper limits |\u03bbi | < 4\u03c0 (perturbativity) and |L| < 16\u03c0 for the eigenvalues L of the\nS-matrix. Assuming the 2HDM is perturbatively defined up to some scale \u039b, these conditions\nshould in principle be fulfilled at all scales \u03bc < \u039b. The resulting limits on the \u03bbi can then be\nstudied in an RGE-improved treatment [17]. Since this is not the primary aim of this paper, we\nlimit our discussion of the theoretical consistency to the input (EW) scale. When the potential\nhas an exact Z2 symmetry (m212 = 0), the requirement of stability, perturbativity, and unitarity\nleads to upper limits on the Higgs masses of mh . 600 GeV, mH . 870 GeV, mA . 870 GeV,\nand mH + . 780 GeV. Breaking the Z2 symmetry softly, the upper limits are further increased,\nas should be expected when introducing the new scale m212 . In the decoupling limit [4], the\nHiggs masses scale like mh \u223c v, and mH,A,H + \u223c mS (1 + v 2 /m2S ), where mS is some high scale\n4\n\n\fH\n\n|m +-mA | (GeV)\n\n500\n400\n300\n200\n100\n00\n\n100\n\n200 300 400\n|m +-mS| (GeV)\n\n500\n\nH\n\nFigure 1: Mass differences for 2HDM points which give contributions to S, T , and U in agreement with the present limits [20] at the 2 \u03c3 level.\nmS \u226b v at which the heavy doublet is integrated out. The existence of the decoupling limit\nshows the absence of an absolute upper limit for the heavy Higgs masses in the general 2HDM.\nWe should therefore focus on deriving lower limits on the masses, which will require additional\ninput from experiments.\nBefore considering the Yukawa sector, we want to briefly discuss electroweak precision tests\nand the 2HDM contribution to the oblique parameters S, T , U [18]. Fixing mh = 114 GeV,\nwe perform a scan over the other 2HDM masses (with mHi > mh ) and sin(\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b1). For each\npoint, the results of [19] are used to evaluate the oblique parameters. Points which fulfill the\nPDG limits [20] at the 2 \u03c3 level are illustrated in Fig. 1. The figure shows the mass splittings\n|mH + \u2212 mA | and |mH + \u2212 mS |, where m2S = m2H sin2 (\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b1) + m2h cos2 (\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b1) is a combined scalar\nmass. We see that both these mass splittings cannot be simultaneously O(v) for the 2HDM\nto be compatible with the EW precision tests. The limits mH + \u2243 mA (independent of \u03b2 \u2212 \u03b1),\nmH + \u2243 mH (with cos(\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b1) = 0), and mH + \u2243 mh (with sin(\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b1) = 0) correspond to the\nknown cases when custodial symmetry ensures T \u2243 0 [8, 21].\n\n3\n\nThe Yukawa sector\n\nAssuming CP conservation, the general Yukawa Lagrangian of the 2HDM, expressed in the\nfermion mass eigenstates, is [6]\ne 1 \u03b7 U UR + QL \u03a61 \u03b7 D DR + QL \u03a61 \u03b7 L LR + QL \u03a6\ne 2 \u03b7 U UR + QL \u03a62 \u03b7 D DR + QL \u03a62 \u03b7 L LR , (8)\n\u2212 LY = Q L \u03a6\n1\n1\n1\n2\n2\n2\n\ne i \u2261 i\u03c32 \u03a6\u2217 .

(13) exhibits tree-level FCNCs unless the \u03c1F are diagonal. A sufficient\ncondition for this to occur is that each fermion type F = {D, U, L} couples to only one Higgs\ndoublet [22]. In Eq. (8) this condition translates into demanding either \u03b71F = 0 or \u03b72F = 0, which\nthrough Eqs. (10), (11) leads to the relations \u03c1F = \u03baF cot \u03b2 and \u03c1F = \u2212\u03baF tan \u03b2, respectively.\nA way to accomplish vanishing \u03b7iF naturally is to impose a symmetry to prevent some of the\ncouplings from appearing in Eq. (8), for example a Z2 symmetry under which one Higgs doublet\nand some of the right-handed fermion fields are odd. Models with such a symmetry are called\n2HDM types. We choose a convention for the types I \u2013 IV given by [13].3 The assignment of\nZ2 charges, and the emergent coupling relations, are specified in Table 1.\n3\n\nThe notation and meaning of the different types varies in the literature. Sometimes type Y (III) and type X\n(IV) is used. In supersymmetry, type III usually refers to the general model encountered when the Z2 symmetry\nof the tree-level type II model is broken by higher order corrections.\n\n6\n\n\fType\n\nUR\n\nDR\n\nLR\n\n\u03c1U\n\n\u03c1D\n\n\u03c1L\n\nI\n\n+\n\n+\n\n+\n\n\u03baU cot \u03b2\n\n\u03baD cot \u03b2\n\n\u03baL cot \u03b2\n\nII\n\n+\n\n\u2212\n\n\u2212\n\n\u03baU cot \u03b2\n\n\u2212\u03baL tan \u03b2\n\nIII/Y\n\n+\n\n\u2212\n\n+\n\n\u03baU cot \u03b2\n\n\u2212\u03baD tan \u03b2\n\nIV/X\n\n+\n\n+\n\n\u2212\n\n\u03baU cot \u03b2\n\n\u03baD cot \u03b2\n\n\u2212\u03baL tan \u03b2\n\n\u2212\u03baD tan \u03b2\n\n\u03baL cot \u03b2\n\nTable 1: Assignment of Z2 charges for the right-handed fermions, and the resulting relations\namong Yukawa coupling matrices in the Z2 -symmetric types of 2HDM Yukawa sectors. The\nHiggs doublets have Z2 quantum numbers \u2212 (\u03a61 ) and + (\u03a62 ).\nThe Z2 -symmetric 2HDM types constitute minimal models for the Yukawa sector in the\nsense that they are one-parameter descriptions. From a phenomenological viewpoint, a rather\nnatural step beyond the types are models with Yukawa alignment [23]. Assuming that the\nYukawa matrices for each type of fermions are proportional by a constant \u03be F , one can define\n\u03be F \u2212tan \u03b2\nF\nand\nthree tan \u03b2-like parameters through \u03c1F = tan \u03b2 F \u03baF , where tan \u03b2 F = 1+\u03be\nF tan \u03b2 . Since \u03ba\nF\n\u03c1 can be diagonalized simultaneously, the model is free of tree-level FCNCs. A further generalization is offered by models where the off-diagonal Yukawa elements are non-zero, but still\nsufficiently small to avoid the experimental bounds from FCNC. Using a a Hermitian six-zero\ntexture for the Yukawa matrices,4 a phenomenologically viable ansatz for this type of models\nwas introduced by Cheng and Sher [25]\np\n2mi mj\n(no sum).\n(14)\n[\u03c1F ]ij = [\u03bbF ]ij\nv\nIt leads to a natural suppression of the off-diagonal elements for \u03bb \u223c O(1) by the quark mass\nhierarchy, in particular for the first generation where the experimental constraints are most\nrestrictive. Different scenarios have been investigated in [26]. The Cheng-Sher ansatz provides\na parametrization useful also for general, flavor-diagonal, Yukawa couplings. From the definition\nof \u03baF , it follows that the diagonal elements are\n\u221a\n2 mi\nF\nF\n[\u03c1 ]ii = [\u03bb ]ii\n= [\u03bbF ]ii [\u03baF ]ii\n(no sum).\n(15)\nv\nThis relation describes general flavor-diagonal couplings with a preserved mass hierarchy.5 The\nnine \u03bbFii (one for each fermion) are free tan \u03b2-like parameters. Both the case of alignment (\u03bbU11 =\n\u03bbU22 = \u03bbU33 = tan \u03b2 U , similarly for D and L), and the models with a Z2 symmetry (e.g. type II:\nF\n\u03bbUii = cot \u03b2, \u03bbD\nii = \u03bbii = \u2212 tan \u03b2) are contained as special cases of this general framework. We\nshall use this phenomenological approach in the following. The Yukawa couplings have been\nimplemented in the generic code 2HDMC [27] used throughout this work. When there is no\n4\n\nThe phenomenology of the related case with four-zero textures was recently discussed in [24].\nFrom the appearance of equation (15) one could refer to this case as generalized alignment, although the\nmotivation in terms of a proportionality between the Yukawa matrices no longer holds.\n5\n\n7\n\n\frisk of confusion, we use the notation \u03bbtt \u2261 \u03bbU33 , \u03bbbb \u2261 \u03bbD\n33 , etc. Inspired by the Z2 -symmetric\nmodels, we further restrict the couplings to, at most, allow for hierarchies of the order\nmd |\u03bbdd | \u223c mu |\u03bbuu | \u223c 0\nms |\u03bbss | \u223c mc |\u03bbcc|,\n\nmc |\u03bbcc | \u223c mb |\u03bbbb |,\n\nmb |\u03bbbb | \u223c mt |\u03bbtt |\n\n(16)\n\nme |\u03bbee | \u226a m\u03bc |\u03bb\u03bc\u03bc | \u226a m\u03c4 |\u03bb\u03c4 \u03c4 |.\nThis means couplings to the first generation are always neglected. Couplings to the nearest\nneighbors in mass can have a hierarchy allowing them to be of similar magnitude, hence they\nmust be considered simultaneously in observables where both couplings appear. No strong\nhierarchy is allowed between generations of equal charge fermions, since this would be unnatural\nunder the Cheng-Sher assumption.\n\n4\n\nConstraints from flavor physics\n\nThe most stringent experimental constraints on the 2HDM come from flavor physics. When\nthe Yukawa couplings are diagonal in flavor space, one could still have sizeable contributions\nto many observables due to charged Higgs exchange, either at tree-level or at one-loop. We\nshall focus on such processes here. The Yukawa coupling dependence from the lowest order\ncharged Higgs contribution to the interesting observables is listed in Table 2, together with the\ncurrent experimental results and the SM expectations. For the numerical evaluation we use\nSuperIso v2.6 [28], both for the SM and the 2HDM contributions. The slight differences in some\nof the SM values compared to earlier published results are explained by parametric updates.\nThe top quark pole mass is set to the latest combined Tevatron value mt = 173.1\u00b10.6\u00b11.1 [29],\ncorresponding to mt = 164.0 GeV using the 2-loop relation. For the other quark masses, we\n+0.07\n+26\nuse the PDG MS values [20] mb = 4.20+0.17\n\u22120.07 GeV, mc = 1.27\u22120.11 GeV, and ms = 104\u221234 MeV\nas input. When calculating leptonic- and semi-leptonic decays of mesons, the running quark\nmasses appearing in the H + couplings are evaluated at the scale of the meson mass. This\nensures that the effective four-fermion operators uL dR lR \u03bdL , obtained when integrating out H + ,\nrenormalize in the same way as the corresponding quark currents [30]. Constraints on the\n2HDM parameters from each observable are presented as exclusion regions at 95% C.L., using\nGaussian two-sided confidence intervals and one degree of freedom.\nNegative searches for the charged Higgs at LEP lead to a lower limit mH + & 78 \u2013 90\nGeV [36]. The exact value depends on the H + decay mode. Strictly speaking, these limits\nare only valid under the assumption that the H + decays with total BR = 1 in the modes\nH + \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03bd\u03c4 and H + \u2192 cs\u0304, with certain benchmarks investigated for H + \u2192 W +(\u2217) A showing\nsimilar exclusion. Even if the 2HDM with general Yukawa couplings could certainly allow for\nexotic decay channels, hierarchical couplings still favor decays into these channels. We will\ntherefore respect the LEP limits in the following and not consider the possibility mH + . mW .\nThe first flavor observable we consider is the branching ratio for the rare FCNC inclusive\ndecay B \u2192 Xs \u03b3, which receives contributions from the charged Higgs at the same level as the\nW contribution in the SM.

The highlighted region is excluded at 95% C.L.\nmH + = 150 GeV, we find that a large fraction of the parameter space is excluded, with a\npreference for smaller values of the couplings in the allowed region. We also see allowed regions\nin Fig. 2 with simultaneously large and equal sign values for \u03bbbb and \u03bbtt . For these fine-tuned\nvalues, a cancellation occurs in the new physics contribution to the Wilson coefficients. The\nsituation is similar for mH + = 400 GeV, except that the size of the allowed region increases.\nAs expected from Eq.

Using the NLO prediction we investigate, for the first time,\nconstraints from \u22060\u2212 on the Yukawa sector of the general 2HDM. The excluded region in\n(\u03bbtt , \u03bbbb ) is presented in Fig. 3. To facilitate a comparison with the results for the branching\nratio, the same values as in Fig. 2 are chosen for mH + . From Figs. 2 and 3, one notices a\nsimilarity in the regions excluded by BR(B \u2192 Xs \u03b3) and \u22060\u2212 .

The result is shown in Fig. 5, where \u03bbbb \u03bb\u03c4 \u03c4 /|\u03bbbb \u03bb\u03c4 \u03c4 |1/2\non the y-axis corresponds to tan \u03b2 in the familiar type II model (for positive values). Bu \u2192 \u03c4 \u03bd\u03c4\nexcludes a large region of the parameter space, with stronger limits obtained on the product\nof couplings for lower values of mH + .

It has been\nshown [48] that comparing differential distributions directly would be a superior method to\nextract the charged Higgs contribution. However, since the collected statistics is still too low,\nthis method has so far not been pursued experimentally. To reduce the uncertainty from the\nvector form factor, we consider the ratio [47]\n\u03beDl\u03bd =\n\nBR(B \u2192 D\u03c4 \u03bd\u03c4 )\n,\nBR(B \u2192 De\u03bde )\n\n(25)\n\nwhere the 2HDM contributes only to the numerator. The resulting constraints based on \u03beDl\u03bd\nare shown in Fig. 6 for mH + = 100, 200 GeV. Similarly to the result for Bu \u2192 \u03c4 \u03bd\u03c4 , the 2HDM\ncontribution in Eq. (24) can be twice the SM contribution with opposite sign, leading to the\ntwo disjoint exclusion regions as observed in Fig. 6. When \u03bbcc \u226a \u03bbbb \u2013 like in the 2HDM II at\nhigh tan \u03b2 \u2013 the effective constraint on \u03bbbb \u03bb\u03c4 \u03c4 can be combined with that from Bu \u2192 \u03c4 \u03bd\u03c4 to\ncover fully the cancellation region observed for low mH + .\nThe last B decay we consider is Bs \u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 , which has so far not been observed experimentally. The SM prediction for the branching ratio is\nBR(Bs \u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 )SM = (3.2 \u00b1 0.5) \u00d7 10\u22129 ,\n\n(26)\n\nwhile the current experimental limit, derived by the CDF collaboration, is [49]:\nBR(Bs \u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 ) < 5.8 \u00d7 10\u22128\n\n(27)\n\nat 95% C.L.

The constraining\npower of Bs \u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 in this study is hence rather limited as compared to the other flavor\nobservables and therefore we do not investigate it further.\nRecently it was suggested [34] to use the observable\nRl23 \u2261\n\nVus (Kl2 ) Vud (0+ \u2192 0+ )\n\u00d7\nVus (Kl3 )\nVud (\u03c0l2 )\n\n(28)\n\nfrom K \u2192 \u03bc\u03bd\u03bc transitions to search for charged Higgs contributions. In this expression Vus (Kli )\nmeans Vus measured in leptonic kaon decay with i particles in the final state (two leptons and\ni \u2212 2 neutral pions). The same notation applies for \u03c0l2 while Vud (0+ \u2192 0+ ) refers to Vud\nmeasured in nuclear beta decay.

The major source of uncertainty in extracting Rl23 experimentally originates in the necessary input of the form factor ratio fK /f\u03c0 from lattice QCD.\nFrom an unquenched calculation with staggered fermions, the HPQCD and UKQCD groups\nhave determined fK /f\u03c0 = 1.189 \u00b1 0.007 [50] which is the number adopted in [34]. We will make\nuse of that same result, keeping in mind that alternative determinations with larger errors exist. Using these would of course reduce the constraining power of K \u2192 \u03bc\u03bd\u03bc transitions. Fig. 7\nshows the result for the product \u03bbss \u03bb\u03bc\u03bc as a function of mH + .

A major source of concern in Eq. (31) is the dependence on the light quark masses.\nEffects of parametric uncertainties in the masses on the constraints from Ds was investigated\nin [35]. We will not repeat this discussion here, but treat the center values as exact quantities.\nConstraints on the 2HDM couplings from the two modes Ds \u2192 \u03c4 \u03bd\u03c4 and Ds \u2192 \u03bc\u03bd\u03bc are\nsummarized in Figs. 8 and 9, respectively. The excluded regions appear quite similar in these\nfigures, as a result of the helicity suppression in the SM, which gives the same relative 2HDM\ncontribution to both decay modes. This is interesting for the prospects of testing the hypothesis\n\u03bb\u03c4 \u03c4 = \u03bb\u03bc\u03bc . A similar test could be performed using the third generation quarks by considering\nBu \u2192 \u03bc\u03bd\u03bc in addition to Bu \u2192 \u03c4 \u03bd\u03c4 . Using the same input as above, the SM prediction becomes\nBR(Bu \u2192 \u03bc\u03bd\u03bc ) = 4.3 \u00d7 10\u22127 .

In the language of the general model, this corresponds\nto universal couplings over the fermion generations and types with tan \u03b2 the only free parameter,\ne.g. 1/\u03bbtt = 1/\u03bbcc = \u2212\u03bbbb = \u2212\u03bbss = tan \u03b2 for type II couplings. The coupling patterns in the\nfour different models we consider are described in Table 1. The results, as shown in Fig. 10 in the\n(mH + , tan \u03b2) plane, are superimposed to combine the exclusion regions of all flavor observables\nin the same figure. This also means that some regions of the parameter space are excluded by\nmore than one observable, such as the high tan \u03b2 region in the type II model.\nFrom Fig. 10, we first note the exclusion of low tan \u03b2 < 1 in all four models for mH + <\n500 GeV. This exclusion comes as a result of three observables: BR(B \u2192 Xs \u03b3), \u22060 , and \u2206MBd .\nThe constraints at low tan \u03b2 are similar between the models, since the couplings to the up-type\nquarks are universal. In the type I model, a value of tan \u03b2 > 1 signals decoupling of one\nHiggs doublet from the whole fermion sector. In 2HDM types II and III, which share the same\ncoupling pattern for the quarks, there exists a tan \u03b2-independent lower limit of mH + & 300\nGeV imposed by BR(B \u2192 Xs \u03b3). No generic lower limit on mH + is found in type I and type\nIV models. Constraints for high tan \u03b2 are only obtained in the type II model. The reason\nbehind this is that the leptonic and semi-leptonic observables require tan \u03b2-enhanced couplings\n\u03bbdd \u03bbll \u223c tan2 \u03b2 \u226b 1 (d = d, s, b) for the contributions to be interesting. In the 2HDM III, and\nIV these couplings are instead always \u03bbdd \u03bbll = \u22121, while in type I they are proportional to\ncot2 \u03b2.\nAn alternative approach to constraining the parameter space is to assume the 2HDM is\nthe correct theory and estimate the parameters by fitting to the available data. To compare\nwith our results in Figure 10, we perform a basic \u03c72 fit to the flavor data of the parameters\n(mH + , tan \u03b2) for the Z2 symmetric models. The \u03c72 measure is constructed in the usual way\nP (Oexp \u2212O2HDM )2\n\u03c72 = i i \u03c32i\n, where \u03c3i2 = (\u03c3iexp )2 + (\u03c3i2HDM )2 combines experimental and theoretical\ni\nuncertainties in quadrature. Parametric uncertainties are not included. We use the eight\nobservables listed in Table 3 as independent probes of the 2HDM. Minimizing the \u03c72 , the first\nobservation is that the 2HDM types I, III, and IV, do not contain enough predictive power for\nthe flavor observables to restrict the parameter space (mH + , tan \u03b2). In all these models, the\ndecoupling limit in one variable (or both) is essentially the best fit. For the 2HDM II on the\nother hand, we obtain a best fit point: mH + = 609 GeV, tan \u03b2 = 5. The fit is illustrated in\nFig. 11. The obtained exclusion region is similar to the combination presented in Fig. 10. At\nthe level of 2 \u03c3, charged Higgs masses mH + < 260 GeV are excluded (mH + < 300 GeV for one\ndegree of freedom). The exclusion in tan \u03b2 extends to tan \u03b2 < 1 and tan \u03b2 > 60 for mH + = 500\nGeV. Both the lower and the upper limits on tan \u03b2 become stricter for lower mH + . In Table 3,\nthe results for the 2HDM II are given in more detail. The results for b \u2192 s\u03b3 transitions is what\ndrives the fit away from decoupling in mH + . In fact, all other measurements favor new physics\ncontributions of opposite sign to those generated by the 2HDM II.

The red\ncross indicates the best fit point mH + = 609 GeV, tan \u03b2 = 5. The contours show levels of\n\u2206\u03c72 = 2.30 (6.18), corresponding to probabilities for 1 \u03c3 (2 \u03c3) Gaussian confidence intervals\nwith two degrees of freedom. The center and right panels show variation of \u2206\u03c72 when changing\nthe parameters mH + and tan \u03b2 around their best fit values.\np\np\nits value of minimum influence, tan \u03b2 = mt /mb \u223c 6.5 (tan \u03b2 = mc /ms \u223c 3.5) for the third\n(second) generation, since no decoupling limit in tan \u03b2 exists in the 2HDM II. Figure 11 shows\nthat the \u03c72 does not deteriorate significantly when increasing mH + , illustrating that decoupling\nis not far from being the best fit to the 2HDM II either. The reduced \u03c72 /d.o.f. = 2.1 for the\n2HDM fit, versus \u03c72 /d.o.f. = 1.8 for the SM reference, confirms that the flavor data does not\nfavor a 2HDM II over the SM at this point.\n\n6\n\nConclusions\n\nAllowing for non-universal Yukawa couplings, the 2HDM can modify significantly the theoretical predictions for many flavor physics observables. Using the public codes 2HDMC [27]\nand SuperIso [28], we have exploited this fact and used available experimental results to place\nconstraints on the couplings of the second and third generation fermions to the charged Higgs\nboson in models with general, flavor-diagonal, Yukawa couplings. Strong and universal constraints are found on the top quark coupling \u03bbtt from \u2206MB and b \u2192 s\u03b3 transitions, requiring\n|\u03bbtt | . 1 for mH + . 500 GeV. Observables such as Bu \u2192 \u03c4 \u03bd\u03c4 or Ds \u2192 l\u03bdl , with a tree-level\ncharged Higgs contribution depending on products of quark and lepton couplings, show sensitivity at low masses mH + . 300 GeV both for the second and the third generations. Typically,\nthe exclusion limit starts at values |\u03bbqq \u03bbll |1/2 & 10 for mH + = 100 GeV with softer limits for\nhigher masses.\nFor the versions of the 2HDM with a Yukawa Z2 symmetry, the lower limit mH + & 300\nGeV from BR(B \u2192 Xs \u03b3) is valid for type II and III models, while no general limit on mH +\nexists for types I and IV. The bound on \u03bbtt in the general model translates into a requirement\nof tan \u03b2 > 1. The tree-level observables investigated yield constraints almost exclusively on the\ntype II model at high tan \u03b2. For this model, we find that only the observables from b \u2192 s\u03b3\ntransitions favor a non-zero 2HDM contribution, leading to a best fit point mH + = 609 GeV,\ntan \u03b2 = 5 close to decoupling.\n19\n\n\f\u2206\u03c72SM\n\nExperimental\n\nSM prediction\n\nBR(B \u2192 Xs \u03b3)\n\n3.52 \u00d7 10\u22124\n\n3.07 \u00d7 10\u22124\n\n1.65\n\n3.59 \u00d7 10\u22124\n\n0.04\n\n0.21\n\n\u22060 (B \u2192 K \u2217 \u03b3)\n\n3.1 \u00d7 10\u22122\n\n7.8 \u00d7 10\u22122\n\n2.82\n\n7.0 \u00d7 10\u22122\n\n1.88\n\n1.37\n\n\u2206MBd (ps\u22121 )\n\n0.507\n\n0.53\n\n0.08\n\n0.53\n\n0.10\n\n0.32\n\nBR(Bu \u2192 \u03c4 \u03bd\u03c4 )\n\n1.73 \u00d7 10\u22124\n\n0.95 \u00d7 10\u22124\n\n1.71\n\n0.95 \u00d7 10\u22124\n\n1.72\n\n\u22121.31\n\n\u03beDl\u03bd\n\n0.416\n\n0.30\n\n0.84\n\n0.30\n\n0.84\n\n\u22120.91\n\n1.000\n\n0.33\n\n1.000\n\n0.33\n\n\u22120.58\n\nRl23 (K \u2192 \u03bc\u03bd\u03bc ) 1.004\n\n2HDM fit\n\n\u2206\u03c722HDM\n\nObservable\n\nPull\n\nBR(Ds \u2192 \u03bc\u03bd\u03bc )\n\n5.8 \u00d7 10\u22123\n\n4.98 \u00d7 10\u22123\n\n3.32\n\n4.98 \u00d7 10\u22123\n\n3.36\n\n\u22121.83\n\nBR(Ds \u2192 \u03c4 \u03bd\u03c4 )\n\n5.7 \u00d7 10\u22122\n\n4.82 \u00d7 10\u22122\n\n3.82\n\n4.82 \u00d7 10\u22122\n\n3.82\n\n\u22121.95\n\nTotal \u03c72 (\u03bd):\n\n14.6 (8)\n\n12.1 (6)\n\nTable 3: Best fit of the 2HDM II to the flavor observables compared to the results for the SM.\nThe experimental and theoretical uncertainties are given in Table 2.\nThe region of 2HDM parameter space where the LHC experiments expect sensitivity (small\nmH + , large tan \u03b2) [54, 55] is very interesting for most of the observables discussed here. Should\na charged Higgs be discovered at the LHC, the underlying model still needs to be determined.\nA low mass charged Higgs points to either the existence of additional low-energy states (as\nin supersymmetry), or non-type II couplings for H + . The 2HDM Yukawa sector is accessible\nthrough flavor physics. In favorable cases, coupling universality between \u03bb\u03c4 \u03c4 and \u03bb\u03bc\u03bc can be\ntested using leptonic B and Ds decays which are helicity suppressed in the SM. Likewise it\nmight be possible to test universality over the fermion generations by combining results from B\ndecays with those from K \u2192 \u03bc\u03bd or Ds \u2192 l\u03bd. To summarize, a charged Higgs boson discovery\nwould provide great opportunities for a rich interplay between flavor and collider physics for\nmany years to come.\n\nAcknowledgments\nWe are grateful to David Eriksson and Johan Rathsman for interesting and useful discussions.\n\nReferences\n[1] T.
