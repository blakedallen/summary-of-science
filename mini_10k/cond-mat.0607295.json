Vertical alignment is attractive\nfor such applications as field emission displays1,2,3,4,5,6,7\nand chemical sensors8. Latest publications9,10,11,12 report almost perfect alignment. Since recently, the efforts\nof researchers were also directed at synthesis of nantobube arrays aligned in a plane 13,14,15,16,17,18 . The objective of this effort is the synthesis of complex organized NT structures for integrated molecular electronics devices and optoelectronic applications. Growth and\npatterning of in-plane oriented arrays require novel technological approaches. A number of such approaches have\nbeen proposed in Refs. 14,15,18, and successfully implemented.\nA planar array of NTs is shown schematically in Fig. 1.\nIn a typical experimental situation the distance, d, between the neighboring NTs in the array is much smaller\nthan the length, 2h, of the constituting NTs. This suggests that the response of the array to the external electric field must exhibit a collective character. For vertically oriented arrays, the collective electrostatic response\nhas been previously discussed in the literature19,20,21 .\nThis response plays a crucial role in designing the NTbased field emitters. For planar arrays, being the emerging area of research, their collective electrostatic properties have never been addressed.\nIntuitively, it is obvious that responses of vertical and\nplanar arrays to external electric field are dramatically\ndifferent. Indeed, external field does not penetrate into\na dense enough vertical array much deeper than the intertube distance20 . In other words, to the first approximation, the tops of NTs constituting the vertical array\ncan be considered as a metallic plate. By contrast, for a\nplanar array, the force lines of external field can extend\n\"above\" and \"below\" the NT plane (see Fig. 1b), thus\ncausing the charge separation within each NT, constituting the array. The collective character of the electrostatic response manifests itself in the fact that the actual\nfield, causing this separation in a given NT is strongly\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n- -\n\n2h 0\n\n-\n\n+\n+\n+ +\n\na)\n\n- -\n\n2h\n+ +\n+\n\n+\n\n+\n\nb)\n\nFIG. 1: a) a planar array of semiconducting NTs in external\nfield, F , is shown schematically; d is the distance between the\nneighboring NTs. As a result of charge separation, the positively and negatively charged regions of length, h\u2212h0 , emerge\nnear the tips. These regions are separated by neutral strips\nof width 2h0 ; b) Force lines of electric field above and below\nthe array are curved as a result of the charge separation. In\ncharged regions the force lines enter (exit) the NTs normally\nto the plane of the array.\n\naltered by the presence of the neighboring NTs. The\nresulting dipole moment, induced in an individual NT\nwithin the planar array, depends on the charge distribution, the form of which is not obvious a priori. The situation is even less trivial if a planar array is made of semiconducting NTs. For a single semiconducting NT the\ncharge separation happens for a field exceeding the critical value Fth = Eg /2eh. As F exceeds Fth , the charges\noccupy progressively larger portion of the NT; positive\nand negative charges are separated by a neutral strip22\nof a length Eg /eF . It is not obvious how, upon increasing\nF above Fth , the field-induced charge separation occurs\nin a planar array of semiconducting NTs. In particular,\nhow the length of the neutral strip depends on the parameters of the array, namely, the length and density of\nconstituting NTs.\nThe questions formulated above are addressed in the\npresent paper. In Sect. II we extend the approach developed in Ref. 20 to the planar array of NTs. In Sect. III\nwe demonstrate that for the planar array the Thomas-\n\n\f2\nFermi equation can be solved exactly and find a simple\nanalytical expression for the charge distribution along the\nNT for arbitrary external field. In particular, we find a\nuniversal relation between the length, 2h0 , of the neutral\nstrip and the applied field, F , and discuss qualitatively\nthe limiting cases; Sect. IV. In Sect. V the exact form\nof the charge distribution is utilized to calculate analytically various characteristics of the array, such as (i) electric field inside the neutral strip, (ii) electric field outside\nthe array, (iii) enhancement of the electric field near the\ntips of NTs, and (iiii) polarizability of NTs in the array.\nConcluding remarks are presented in Sect.

The charge separation in a given NT of the array occurs due to the external field and the field, created by induced charges\non all NTs. This separation proceeds until the local\nchemical potential assumes a constant value along each\nNT of the array. This local chemical potential of mth NT, \u03bcm (z), is related to the local charge density via\nthe NT electronic spectrum20,22 as follows: \u03bcm (z) =\nsign(z)(Eg2 /4 + [\u03c1m (z)/g]2 )1/2 . Then the condition of\nthe constant chemical potential can be presented in the\nform of generalized Thomas-Fermi equation, which for a\ngiven NT, m, in the array reads\neF z \u2212\n\nZ\n\nh\n\ndz \u2032\n\n\u2212h\n\nX\nn\n\nRigorous justification of the continuous description is\ngiven in Appendix, where we show that the effect of discreteness of NTs in the array amounts to a small \u223c d/h\ncorrection to \u03c1(z).\n\n\u03c1n (z \u2032 )\u03c6(z, z \u2032 ; Rm \u2212 Rn ),\n\nv\n#2\n\"\nu\nu E2\n\u03c1m (z)\ng\nt\n= sign(z)\n,\n+\n4\ng\n\n(1)\nIII.\n\nwhere |Rn \u2212 Rm | is the distance between the centers of\nthe NTs n and m. In Eq. (1) the dimensionless interaction parameter g is related to the electron velocity, v0 ,\nin the NT as20,22 g = (2N e2 /\u03c0\u01eb\u2217 ~v0 ), where N is the\nnumber of conducting channels, which assumes the values 2 or 4 depending on the spin and band degeneracy.\nThis degeneracy is governed by the NT chirality. The\npotential, \u03c6(z, z \u2032 ), in Eq. (1) is given by\ne\np\n\u03c6(z, z ; R) =\n,\n\u2217\n\u01eb (z \u2212 z \u2032 )2 + R2\n\u2032\n\nHere we have used the fact that \u03c1(z) = \u2212\u03c1(\u2212z). The\nterm 2Ld \u03c1(z) in the rhs of Eq. (3) comes from the term\nwith n = 0 in the sum (1) and describes the \"self-action\"\nof a given N T . For an isolated NT22 this term has the\nform 2 ln(h/r)\u03c1(z), where r is the NT radius. In the presence of neighboring NTs, the self-action is limited by the\ndistance \u223c d, so that Ld is equal to ln(d/r) analogously\nto the vertical array20. Now taking the continuous limit\nin Eq. (3) reduces to replacement the sum over n in the\nkernel Eq. (4) by the integral, leading to the following\nintegral equation\nv\n#2\n\"\nu\nu E2\n\u03c1(z)\ng\nt\n+\neF z = sign(z)\n4\ng\nZ h\n2N0\n+ 2Ld \u03c1(z) + \u2217\ndz \u2032 \u03c1(z \u2032 ) ln(|z \u2212 z \u2032 |).

For a regular array\nwe set all \u03c1n (z) equal to \u03c1(z) and introduce the NT density, N0 , as N0 = 1/d. As the next step, we take the\ncontinuous limit of Eq. (1). In doing so, we first isolate\n\nSOLUTION OF THE INTEGRAL\nEQUATION\nA.\n\nMetallic NTs\n\nIn the case of metallic NTs we set Eg = 0 in Eq. (5).\nWe will also neglect the self-action term, 2Ld , in the rhs;\nthe validity of this step will be verified in the end of this\nSubsection. Then, for positive z, Eq. (5) takes the form\n2N0\neF z = \u2217\n\u01eb\n\nZ\n\nh\n\ndz \u2032 \u03c1(z \u2032 ) ln\n\n0\n\nz + z\u2032\n.\nz \u2212 z\u2032\n\n(6)\n\nNote that Eq. (6) does not contain any small parameter.\nIndeed, upon introducing dimensionless charge density\nand coordinate as\n\u03c1\u0303 =\n\nN0\n\u03c1,\ne\u01eb\u2217 F\n\nz\u0303 =\n\nz\n,\nh\n\n(7)\n\n\f3\ntakes the form\n\nEq. (7) assumes the following form\nz\u0303 =\n\nZ\n\n1\n\ndz\u0303 \u2032 \u03c1\u0303(z\u0303 \u2032 ) ln\n\n0\n\nz\u0303 + z\u0303 \u2032\n.\nz\u0303 \u2212 z\u0303 \u2032\n\n(8)\n\nIn Eq. (8) the relevant values of \u03c1\u0303, z \u2032 , and z\u0303 are all of\nthe order of unity. It turns out, however, that, despite\nthe absence of a small parameter, Eq. (8) can be solved\nanalytically in the closed form.

The last identity in Eq. (10) emerges upon\nsubstitution z\u0303 = sin \u03c6. Our key observation is that the\nintegral in rhs is equal \u2212\u03c0/2 for all |z\u0303| < 1, so that \u03c1\u0303(z\u0303)\nin the form (9) is indeed the solution of Eq. (8). Returning to dimensional variables, we present the final result\nfor the charge density distribution in the form\n\u03c1(z) =\n\ne\u01eb\u2217 F z\n\u221a\n.\n\u03c0N0 h2 \u2212 z 2\n\n(11)\n\nRecall now, that this result was obtained neglecting the\nself-action. To verify the validity of this assumption, we\nestimate the ratio, 2Ld \u03c1(z)/e\u01eb\u2217 F z, of the self-action term\nin Eq. (5) to the lhs. As follows from Eq. (11), this ratio is \u223c Ld /N0 h. Thus, the self-action can be neglected,\nif N0 > Ld /h, i.e., when the array is sufficiently dense.\nAlthough the self-action term is relatively small, it overweighs the integral term near the tips, where the solution\nEq. (11) diverges. This suggests that the divergence in\n2\n(11) must be cut off at (h \u2212 z) \u223c h (Ld /hN0 ) , where\nthe the first term in the rhs of Eq. (5) becomes comparable to the lhs. At the cutoff, the ratio (h \u2212 z)/h is\n2\n\u223c (Ld /hN0 ) \u226a 1, indicating that, in a dense array, the\nsolution Eq. (11) applies up to the close vicinity of the\ntip.\nB.\n1.\n\nSemiconducting NTs\n\nReduction of the Thomas-Fermi equation to the\nHilbert form\n\nUpon neglecting self-action, and in the limit of large g,\nthe Thomas-Fermi equation for the charge distribution\n\nEg\n2N0\n= \u2217\n2\n\u01eb\n\neF z \u2212 sign(z)\n\nZ\n\nh\n\n\u2212h\n\ndz \u2032 \u03c1(z \u2032 ) ln(|z \u2212 z \u2032 |). (12)\n\nAs was explained qualitatively in the Introduction [see\nalso Ref. (22)], in contrast to the metallic case, the solution of Eq. (12) is singular. This is because the positive\nand negative charges near the tips, induced by the external field, are separated by the neutral strip, caused\nby a finite bandgap, Eg , with boundaries at z = \u00b1h0 .\nWithin this strip we have \u03c1(z) = 0. As the external\nfield increases, the strip narrows. Solving Eq. (12) implies finding both the form of \u03c1(z) outside the interval\n[\u2212h0 , h0 ] and the dependence of h0 on the external field.\nFormally, with finite Eg , the integral equation contains\none dimensionless parameter, Eg /eF h. In this subsection\nwe demonstrate that the exact solution of Eq. (12) can be\nobtained for arbitrary value of this parameter. As a first\nstep it is convenient to differentiate both sides of Eq. (12)\nwith respect to z. This yields the following Hilbert-type\nintegral equation\ne\u01eb\u2217 F\n=\n2N0\n\nZ\n\n\u2212h0\n\n\u2212h\n\ndz \u2032\n\n\u03c1(z \u2032 )\n+\nz \u2212 z\u2032\n\nZ\n\nh\n\nh0\n\ndz \u2032\n\n\u03c1(z \u2032 )\n.\nz \u2212 z\u2032\n\n(13)\n\nOur key observation is that the 2D geometry of the array\nallows one to employ the technique of conformal mapping\nin order to solve Eq. (13). The choice of the appropriate\nconformal transformation is described below.\n\n2.\n\nConformal Mapping\n\nThe conformal mapping method can be applied for\nlarge g, when each of the regions \u2212h < z < \u2212h0 and\nh0 < z < h are equipotential. Then a general solution\nof the 2D Poisson equation with boundary conditions of\nequipotentiality on flat metal surfaces can be obtained\nfrom mapping of the boundaries of these surfaces on the\nreal axis in the complex plane. What makes the case of\nsemiconducting array nontrivial, is that the boundaries\nof equipotential regions have a doubly-connected geometry.\nTo gain an insight as to what is the appropriate form\nof the transformation for the geometry under study, it\nis instructive to start with an auxiliary problem of two\nisolated metallic plates in external field, occupying the\nintervals [\u2212h, \u2212h0 ] and [h0 , h]. Two metallic plates correspond to the two cuts on the complex plane, as shown\nin Fig. 2. The general solution of Eq. (13) for this geometry can be found in the textbooks24,25,26,27 . It can\nbe expressed through the integrals along the closed contours L\u2212 and L+ , encompassing the cuts in the clockwise\n\n\f4\nIm(t)\n\nL_\n\u2212h\n\nL+\n\u2212h 0\n\nh0\n\nh\n\nRe(t)\n\nThe relation between h0 and Eg can be now established\nby substitution of the solution Eq. (15) with unknown\nconstants A and h0 into Eq. (13) and equating linear in\nz and constant terms to eF z and Eg /2, respectively. This\nyields A = \u2212\u01eb\u2217 F/\u03c0 2 N0 and the following transcendental\nequation for h0\n\u0013 \u0014 2\u0015\n\u0014 2\u0015 \u0012\nh20\nh\nh0\nEg\n(17)\n= E 2 \u2212 1 \u2212 2 K 20 ,\n2eF h\nh\nh\nh\n\nFIG. 2: Contours of integration in Eq.

In conclusion of this\n\ndirection, in the following way\n\nG=h0 \u0090h\n\nA\n\u03c1(z) = p\n2\n(z \u2212 h20 )(h2 \u2212 z 2 )\n)\n(I\np\n\u221a\nh2 \u2212 t2 t2 \u2212 h20\n.\n\u00d7\ndt\nz\u2212t\nL\u2212 \u222aL+\n\n3.\n\n1\n0.8\n\n(14) 0.6\n\n2.\n\n1.\n\n0.4\n3.\n\nSolution for the charge density distribution\n\nAlthough Eq. (14) satisfies Eq. (13), it cannot be applied to the planar array of semiconducting NTs. The\nreason lies in the fundamental difference between the isolated metallic plates and array of semiconducting NTs.\nIn the former case each plate respects electroneutrality,\nR \u2212h\nRh\ni.e., \u2212h 0 dz\u03c1(z) = 0, h0 dz\u03c1(z) = 0, while the array is\nneutral only as a whole. Still Eq. (14) can be modified to\naccount for this difference. The modification amounts to\nadding a constant to the integral in Eq. (14) after which\nacquires the following form\n1\n\u03c1(z) = p\n2\n2\n(z \u2212 h0 )(h2 \u2212 z 2 )\n)\n( Z\np\n\u221a\nh\nt h2 \u2212 t2 t2 \u2212 h20\n+ C . (15)\ndt\n\u00d7sign(z) 2A\nt2 \u2212 z 2\nh0\nIt can be checked by a direct substitution that Eq. (15)\nis the solution of Eq. (13) for arbitrary C. On the other\nhand, with nonzero C, the net charge in each of the\nintervals [\u2212h, \u2212h0 ] and [h0 , h] is finite. On the physical grounds, the value of the constant C should be\nnow determined from the condition \u03c1(h0 ) = 0, which\nfixes the ratio of the constants C and A at the value\nC/A = \u2212(\u03c0/2)(h2 \u2212 h20 ). The meaning of this condition\nis that the charge density vanishes at the boundaries of\nthe neutral strip. It turns out that the result Eq. (15)\ncan be greatly simplified. Namely, the integral can be\nevaluated analytically leading to the following simple expression for the induced charge density\ns\n\u2217\ne\u01eb F z 2 \u2212 h20\n.\n(16)\n\u03c1(z) = sign(z)\n\u03c0N0 h2 \u2212 z 2\n\n0.2\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\nx=Eg \u00902eFh\n\nFIG. 3: (Color online) Curve 1: Dimensionless length of a\nneutral strip G(x) = h0 /h is plotted versus dimensionless ratio x = Fth /F from Eq. (17); Curves 2 and 3 are the asymtotes\nplotted from Eq. (19).\n\nSection, we note that conformal mapping was previously\nemployed to find the positions of boundaries of the twodimensional electron gas in a smooth external potential28\nas well as to find the positions of edges of incompressible\nstrips in the quantum Hall sample29 .\n\nIV.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nEq. (17) defines a universal dependence of the length,\n2h0 , of the neutral strip on the applied field, F . This\ndependence can be parameterized as\n\u0010F \u0011\nth\nh0 = h G\n,\nF\n\n(18)\n\nwhere Fth = Eg /2eh is the threshold value of F that\ncauses the charge separation in the array. The dimensionless function, G(x) is shown in Fig. 2. It has the\nfollowing asymptotes\n\u221a\n2 x\nx \u226a 1;\nG(x) = \u221a ,\n\u03c0\n2 (1 \u2212 x)\nG(x) = 1 +\n, (1 \u2212 x) \u226a 1.\n(19)\nln (1 \u2212 x)\n\n\f5\nAs seen from Fig. 2, the above asymptotes approximate\nG(x) very closely. The dependence G(x) should be contrasted to the corresponding dependence for an isolated\nNT, where it has the form22 G0 (x) = x. We note, that\nG(x) > G0 (x) for all x. In other words, the neutral strip\nfor NT array is wider than that for a single NT. The difference is especially pronounced for strong fields, corresponding to x \u226a 1, where we have G(x)/G0 (x) \u223c x\u22121/2 .\nThe origin of such a difference lies in the fact that the\narray screens the external field much more efficiently\nthan a single NT. As a result, for strong fields, when\nh0 \u226a h, the field inside the strip is \u223c (h0 /h) times\nsmaller than F . Then the condition that the potential drop within the neutral strip is equal to Eg can be\npresented as eh0 (h0 F/h) \u223c Eg . This condition yields\n\u00011/2\nh0 \u223c Eg h/eF\n, which is in agreement with the smallx asymptote G(x) \u223c x1/2 of Eq. (19).\nFor an individual NT, the induced charge density\nchanges linearly near the edges of the neutral strip22 .\nBy contrast, for a 2D array, \u03c1(z) described\nby Eq. (16)\n\u221a\nexhibits a singular behavior, \u03c1(z) \u221d \u00b1 z \u00b1 h0 , near the\nboundaries of the neutral strip.\nThe principal assumption that allowed us to find the\ncharge distribution in semiconducting\np NT analytically is\nthat in Eq. (12) we had replaced (Eg /2)2 + (\u03c1/g)2 in\nEq. (5) by Eg /2. Using the result Eq. (16), we can now\ncheck the validity of this assumption. It is easy to see that\nthe replacement is justified when the external field is not\ntoo strong, so that the dimensionless ratio x = Fth /F in\nEq. (19) must exceed the value (gN0 h)\u22121 \u226a 1.\n\nV.\n\nIMPLICATIONS\n\nExact results Eqs. (11), (16) for the charge distribution in metallic and semiconducting arrays, obtained\nabove, enable us to calculate analytically various observable characteristics of the array. In this Section we will\nfocus on the following characteristics: electric field distribution inside and outside of the array, and collective\npolarizability of the array. Concerning the electric field\ndistribution, the questions most interesting for applications are the distribution of electric field within the neutral strips and behavior of electric field near the NT tips.\nThe fist question is important for electrooptical measurements, while the second question is crucial for the field\nemission. In addition, it is instructive to study quantitatively how the charges, induced in the NTs by external\nfield, alter this field in the regions above and below the\narray. In particular, the interesting question is how the\nspatial decay of the electric field component normal to\nthe array depends on the position, z, along the NTs.\nThese questions are addressed in subsections that follow.\n\nA.\n\nElectric field inside the neutral strip\n\nElectrostatic potential inside the neutral strip is given\nby superposition of the external potential, eF z, and the\ninduced potential\n\n\u03c6ind (z) =\n\n2N 0\ne\u01eb\u2217\n\nZ\n\nh\n\ndz \u2032 \u03c1(z \u2032 ) ln\nh0\n\nz + z\u2032\n,\nz \u2212 z\u2032\n\n(20)\n\nwhere z < h0 . Upon substituting the exact form of\nthe charge density, Eq. (16), in to Eq. (20) the integration can be performed analytically. We will present the\nresult for the tangential component of the net electric\nfield which is the sum of the external, F , and induced,\nFzind = \u2202\u03c6ind (z)/\u2202z, fields inside the neutral strip,\n\nFzst\n\n=\n\nFzind\n\n+F =F\n\ns\n\n\u0002\n\n\u00032\nh0 (F ) \u2212 z 2\n,\nh2 \u2212 z 2\n\n(21)\n\nwhere the dependence h0 (F ) is defined by Eq. (17) and\nplotted in Fig. 3. In the limit of weak external field, close\nto the threshold value, Fth , Eq. (21) yields a natural result that Fzst \u2248 F . This is because the induced charge\noccupies only a small portion, (h \u2212 h0 ) \u226a h0 , of the\nNTs. In the opposite limit of the strong external field,\nF \u226b Fth , the field, Fzst , at the center of the NTs is equal\nto F h0 [F ]/h \u226a F , i.e., it is strongly suppressed, and\nfalls off towards the ends of the strip. Note, that in our\nqualitative derivation of the width of the neutral strip\nwe have used the estimate Fzst \u223c F h0 /h for the field inside the strip. Therefore, Eq. (21) justifies this estimate.\nThe reason why we focused on the tangential component, Fzst , is its possible relevance for the experiment30 on\nelectroabsorption of light. It might seem that, with photon energy \u223c 1eV much bigger than eF h, the large-scale\nnanotube geometry is not important. This, however, is\nnot the case. The reason is that the dipole moment of\nthe many-body optical transition is directed along the\ntube31,32,33,34,35 . In analysis of the data in Ref. 30 it\nwas assumed that in the change, [\u03b1(\u03c9, Fz ) \u2212 \u03b1(\u03c9, 0)], of\nthe absorption coefficient, Fz is the external field. Meanwhile, the optical transition is modified by the acting\nfield, Fzst . Then Eq. (21) suggests that the acting field\ncan be much smaller than the external field and, moreover, behaves as Fzst \u221d F 1/2 due to the collective screening.\n\nB.\n\nElectric field outside the array\n\nConsider a point with coordinate, z, located at a distance, H, above the array. Similarly to Eq.

(23) allows one to trace how the tangent component,\nFz , grows from zero to F with increasing H, while the\nnormal component falls off from 2\u03c0N0 \u03c1(z) to zero with\nincreasing H. The characteristic scale of change for both\ncomponents is H \u223c h. This behavior is illustrated in\nFig. 4.\n\n0.2\nH\u0090h\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\nFIG. 5: (Color online) Dimensionless tangent component,\nFz /F , of the net electric field is plotted from Eq. (23) vs.\ndimensionless distance, H/h, from the array for various values of coordinate, z, along the array. The plots are presented\nfrom bottom up: z/h = 0.1; 0.7; 0.9; 0.95.\n\nand z/h = 0.9 intersect at H/h \u2248 0.3677 (see inset\nin Fig. 5). This implies that the derivative \u2202F\u22a5 /\u2202z\nis zero at this point. On the other hand the relation\n\u2202F\u22a5 /\u2202z = \u2202Fz /\u2202H suggests that Fz (H) must have a\nmaximum at H/h \u2248 0.3. As seen from Fig. 5, this is\nindeed the case. It is also seen from Fig. 4 that, for z/h\napproaching 1, the field F\u22a5 grows in the vicinity of the\nplane of the array H \u2192 0. This is the manifestation of\nthe enhancement of electric field near the tip.

Two insets illustrate\nthat the curves F\u22a5 (H) for z/h = 0.8 and z/h = 0.9 intersect\neach other. The actual point of intersection (not showed) is\nat H/h \u2248 0.3677.\n\nWe see that, as could be expected, F\u22a5 falls off monotonically with increasing the distance, H, from the array. Less trivial is that the curves for z/h = 0.85\n\nWith metallic charge density distribution Eq. (11) the\nintegration in Eq. (25) can be performed analytically. We\nwill present the result for the field enhancement factor,\n\u03b2 = Fzind /F , which is the conventional characteristics of\nthe field near the tip\nh2\np\n\u03b2= p 2\n.\nz0 \u2212 h2 (z0 + z02 \u2212 h2 )\n\n(26)\n\nWe can now compare the dependence \u03b2(z0 ) for the planar array and for an isolated NT. For the isolated NT\nwe have22 \u03b2(z0 ) \u221d h/(z0 \u2212 h) (in the present notations). By contrast, Eq. (26) yields a slower decay,\n\u03b2(z0 ) \u223c h1/2 /(z0 \u2212 h)1/2 . On the other hand, the magnitude of the enhancement factor is much weaker for the\nplanar array than for the isolated NT. Obviously, this\nreduction is due to the collective screening.\n\n\f7\nD.\n\nInduced dipole moment\n\nThe dipole moment, P , of a given NT within the array\nis defined as\nZ h\ndz z\u03c1(z).\n(27)\nP (F ) = 2\nh0\n\nAnalytical evaluation of the integral in Eq.

This singularity\nis the manifestation\n\u221a of the singular behavior of the charge\ndensity, \u03c1(z) \u221d z \u2212 h0 , at the boundary of the neutral\nstrip. By contrast, for the individual NT, this behavior\nis regular, namely \u03c1(z) \u221d (z \u2212 h0 ).\nIn the strong-field limit, the contribution of the neutral\nstrip to P (F ) constitutes a relatively small correction\n\u223c Fth /F . Essentially, the polarizability \u03c7 = P (F )/F of\na given NT is \u223c eh2 /N0 , as seen from Eq. (28). On the\nother hand, the value of \u03c7 for the individual NT can be\nestimated from the textbook problem36 of polarization\nof an ellipsoid with large ratio of axes in electric field\ndirected along the major axis. With logarithmic accuracy\none has, \u03c7 \u223c eh3 . Thus, compared to the individual\nNT, the polarizability of a given NT within the array is\nsuppressed by a large factor N0 h. This conclusion can\nbe reformulated as follows. An element of the array of\na width h contains N0 h NTs. The integral polarizability\nof this element is \u223c (N0 h)(eh2 /N0 ) = eh3 , i.e., it is of\nthe same order as polarizability of the individual NT.\nTherefore, the magnitude of suppression of \u03c7 within the\narray, can be understood from the fact that, within the\narray, the constituting NTs \"talk to each other\" only if\ntheir separation is smaller than h.\n\nVI.\n\nCONCLUDING REMARKS\n\nThroughout the paper we assumed that the NTs in\nthe planar array are parallel to each other. Note, that\nrecently a different class of planar NT arrays in the form\n\nof a random network, residing on the polymeric substrate, and connecting the source and drain electrodes\nhas been discussed and realized experimentally37,38,39 . It\nwas demonstrated that such a network can emulate the\nchannel of the field-effect transistor. Since in our consideration of the planar array was carried in continuous\nlimit, the results obtained are relevant to the random\nplanar dense arrays.\nOur main results are Eqs. (11), (16) describing the\ndistribution of induced charge in metallic and semiconducting planar arrays, respectively. These results were\nobtained in the continuous limit, i.e., we replaced the array of individual NTs with a two-dimensional continuous\nlayer of a zero width. Such a replacement is justified with\nhigh accuracy as long as the NT length, h, exceeds the\nseparation, d, between the neighboring NTs. More quantitatively, as shown in Appendix, the relative correction\nto the induced charge distribution is \u223c d/h. Similarly,\nthe randomness in distances between the neighboring\nNTs is not important for the planar array. This should\nbe contrasted to the infinite vertical array20, where the\ndistance between neighboring NTs governs the penetration depth of the external field. By contrast, the continuous description adopted in the present paper applies\nwith high accuracy, since, in the planar array, the induced charge extends over the entire length, 2h, of the\nNTs. This length the is much bigger than N0\u22121 . The discreteness of the array manifests itself only in the close\nvicinity of the tips, where it cuts off the singularity\n\u03c1(z) \u221d (h \u2212 z)\u22121/2 in the distribution of the induced\ncharge.\nIt is instructive to trace how the results obtained in the\npresent paper for the planar array evolve when one considers the vertical array of a finite thickness, W . Consider\nfirst the most interesting case of intermediate thickness,\nd \u226a W \u226a h. The modification of our result Eq. (11) to\nthis case can be understood from the following reasoning. Each square with the side W contains (W/d)2 NTs.\nThis square can be viewed as a single \"combined\" NT.\nThen the charge density in this combined NT is given by\nEq. (11) with N0 replaced by W \u22121 . To find the charge\ndensity per a single NT, this result should be divided by\n(W/d)2 . Thus we conclude, that modification of Eq. (11)\nto finite W < h amounts to the replacement of N0\u22121 by\nd2 /W , so that the induced charge density falls off as 1/W\nwith increasing the width. However, the applicability of\nEq. (11) to the finite-width array is limited by the size\nof a \"combined\" NT, i.e., (h \u2212 z) must exceed W . As\nW exceeds the NT length, this condition cannot be met,\nand the charge distribution changes dramatically from\nthe power-law behavior to the exponential screening20 .\nNote that our basic integral equation, Eq. (5), expressing the fact that electrochemical potential is constant\nalong each NT of the array allow the exact solution using the technique of conformal mapping only when the\n\"self-action\" [second term in the rhs of Eq. (5)] is neglected. This step is well justified for a dense array. In\nthe electrostatics of inhomogeneous fractional quantum\n\n\f8\nHall liquids40,41 the charge distribution is described by\nthe equations similar to Eq. (5), i.e., with logarithmic\nkernel, but with self-action playing an important role.\nThen these equations can be solved only numerically.\n\nTherefore, after performing the summation over n in\nEq. (4) and using Eq. (33), the rhs of Eq. (3) will acquire the form\n\nZ\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nh\n\ndz \u2032 \u03c1(z \u2032 )S(z, z \u2032 ),\n\n(34)\n\n0\n\nThis work was supported by NSF under Grant No.\nDMR-0503172 and by the Petroleum Research Fund under Grant No. 43966-AC10.\n\nVII.\n\nAPPENDIX\n\nS(z, z \u2032 ) =\n\nBelow we present a rigorous derivation of Eq. (5) for a\nperiodic array of NTs. We start from the identity\nZ\n\u0010\n\u0011\n1 \u221e\n1\n\u221a\n=\ndq K0 |x| q exp (iqb) ,\n\u03c0 \u2212\u221e\nx2 + b2\n(30)\nwhere K0 (x) is the modified Bessel function of the second\nkind. To use this identity in Eq. (3), we set b \u2192 Rn = nd.\nThen the summation in the integrand in the rhs can be\nreadily performed; it transforms the sum over n in Eq. (4)\ninto the following sum of the \u03b4-functions\n!\nX\n2\u03c0 X\n2\u03c0p\n,\n(31)\nexp (iqRn ) =\n\u03b4 q\u2212\nd p\nd\nn\nwhere p assumes all integer values. As the next step we\nisolate the term with p = 0 in the kernel Eq. (4) from all\nother terms with nonzero p. Then we make use of the\nfact, that\nK0 (x) = \u2212\u03b3 + ln 2 \u2212 ln |x| + O(x2 ),\n\nx \u226a 1, (32)\n\nwhere \u03b3 is the Euler constant. Then, for the term with\np = 0, we get\n\u0002\n\u0003 2\n2\nz \u2212 z\u2032\n.\nlim K0 (|z \u2212 z \u2032 |q) \u2212 K0 (|z + z \u2032 |q) = ln\nd q\u21920\nd\nz + z\u2032\n\n(33)\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\nwhere the kernel S(z, z \u2032) is given by\n\nM.

(5) and comes\nfrom p = 0 in Eq. (31). The remaining sum over p gives\nrise to the \"self-action\" term in Eq. (5). The easiest way\nto see this is to replace the summation over p by integration dp, which would immediately yield\n\nS0 (z, z \u2032 ) = \u03c6(z \u2212 z \u2032 ) \u2212 \u03c6(z + z \u2032 )\n\n(36)\n\nfor the second part of the kernel (35). Note that S0 (z, z \u2032 )\n20,22\nis nothing but the kernel\n. However,\nP for Ra single NT\nby dp is justified only when a\nthe replacement of the\np6=0\n\nlarge number of terms contribute to the sum. This is the\ncase only when the condition |z \u2212 z \u2032 | . d is met. Then,\nupon substituting (36) into (31) and restricting integration over z \u2032 to |z \u2032 \u2212z| . d, the self-action term in Eq. (5) is\nrecovered. Concerning the second part of the kernel (35)\nat |z \u2032 \u2212 z| > d, it is dominated by the terms with p = \u00b11,\n\u0010\n\u00111/2\nn\no\nwhich behave as d/|z\u2212z \u2032|\nexp \u22122\u03c0|z\u2212z \u2032|/d . Contribution coming from this part to the integral Eq. (34)\nis \u223c \u03c1(z), which is parametrically smaller than the selfaction term 2Ld \u03c1(z).\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\nS. Fan, M. G.
