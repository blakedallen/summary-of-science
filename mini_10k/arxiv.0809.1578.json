Here we use usual notations for susceptible and infective individuals\ndenoting them as S and I respectively. Assuming that there is no influx of susceptible\nhosts in out model, we can write that\nd\nS(t) = \u2212T (S, I).\ndt\n\u2217\n\ne-mail: anovozhilov@gmail.com\n\n1\n\n\fHistorically the earliest form of the transmission function was a simple bilinear form,\ni.e., T (S, I) = \u03b2SI [17], which follows from the assumptions of random contacts, host\nhomogeneity, and application of the law of mass action, thereby implying that the contact\nrate of any individual is a linear function of the population size (see [5] for more details).\nHere \u03b2 > 0 is the transmission coefficient. Under the proportional mixing assumption (the\ncontact rate is fixed), the transmission function takes the form T (S, I) = \u03b2SI/N, N is a\npopulation size. If the model includes an assumption of the constant population size these\ntwo transmission functions are virtually the same from any practical viewpoint, whereas\nvariable population size can yield dramatically different behaviors (e.g., [2, 3, 22]).\nIt was early acknowledged that other than bilinear or proportional mixing transmission\nfunctions should be used in epidemiological models to provide better fit of the model solutions to empirical data (see [20] for a general account of different models for transmission\nfunctions).\nOne of the most widely used functions has the following form:\nT (S, I) = \u03b2S p I q ,\n\np, q > 0.\n\n(1)\n\nWe will term this transmission function as power law relationship. It was first used in [29,\n30] in the form T (S, I) = \u03b2S p I \"to investigate the consequences of various assumptions\nwhen the laws are not known\". Severo [25] considered general form (1) where both p and\nq are not equal to one, though he did not give a detailed analysis of the model. Liu et\nal. [18, 19] gave a thorough analysis of different compartmental epidemiological models\nwith (1) and showed that incorporating power law transmission function yields various\ndynamical behaviors not observable in models with bilinear incidence rate, e.g., limit\ncycles and multiple equilibrium points. Additional analysis and details of such models\ncan be found in [9, 10].\nSince the first use of the power law transmission function its form was explained on a\nbasis of \"intrinsic heterogeneity in mixing pattern\" of a population under question. The\nexponents p and q were dubbed as \"heterogeneity parameters\" [25], but the model itself\nis considered phenomenological and lacking mechanical derivation [20] in contract to, e.g.,\nbilinear relationship, which is based on a dubious but well established law of mass action\n[8].\nThe link between phenomenological power law incidence rate and population heterogeneity was made explicit when it was shown that such mean-field models can provide\nan accurate approximation to network based simulations that include variation in the\nstrength, duration, and number of contacts per person. In [26] the transmission function\nwas used in the form T (S, I) = \u03b2S p I, whereas full non-linear transmission function was\nimplemented in [24]. In both cases it was shown that power law relationship improves\nthe accuracy of mean-field model predictions when compared with models with bilinear transmission function (see also [1] for a review on comparison of homogeneous and\nheterogeneous models).\nIn this note we show that power law transmission function can be not only postulated\nbut also derived, using a simple heterogeneous SI model. The paper organized as follows.\n2\n\n\fIn the next section we formulate a mechanistic heterogeneous SI model from the first\nprinciples. Section 3 gives a brief exposition of necessary analytical tools. In Section 4 we\npresent the main results of the study showing that our heterogeneous model is equivalent\nto a homogeneous one, but with a non-linear transmission function.\n\n2\n\nModel formulation\n\nHeterogeneity profoundly affects the dynamics of infection. Differences in contact rates,\nspatial distributions of susceptible hosts, infectiousness and susceptibility of individuals\nhave a direct effect on disease dynamics. Here, we specifically look into heterogeneity\nin disease parameters (such as susceptibility) do not touching an important topics of\nheterogeneity mediated by a structured variable, such as explicit space or age structure.\nOur approach is close to the one given in, e.g., [6, 7, 27] (see also [23] for more details).\nModel I. We start with a generic assumption that the subpopulation of susceptible hosts\nis heterogeneous, and denote s(t, \u03c9) the density of susceptibles at time t having parameter\nvalue \u03c9, which determines susceptibility to a particular disease and varies\nR from individual\nto individual. The total size of the susceptibles is given by S(t) = \u03a9 s(t, \u03c9) d\u03c9, where\n\u03a9 is the set of parameter values. Assuming that the subpopulation of the infectives is\nhomogeneous (later we relax this assumption), the contact process is described with the\nlaw of mass action, and the rate of change in the susceptibles is determined by transmission\nparameter, which is a function of \u03c9, we obtain that\n\u2202\ns(t, \u03c9) = \u2212\u03b2(\u03c9)s(t, \u03c9)I(t).\n\u2202t\n\n(2)\n\nHere \u03b2(\u03c9) incorporates information on the contact rate and the probability of a successful\ncontact.\nThe change in the infective class is given by\nZ\nd\nI(t) = I(t) s(t, \u03c9) d\u03c9 = \u03b2\u0304(t)S(t)I(t),\n(3)\ndt\n\u03a9\nwhere we denote\n\u03b2\u0304(t)\n\nZ\n\nps (t, \u03c9) d\u03c9,\n\nps (t, \u03c9) =\n\n\u03a9\n\ns(t, \u03c9)\n.\nS(t)\n\nTherefore, \u03b2\u0304(t) is the mean value of the function \u03b2(\u03c9) with respect to probability density\nfunction ps (t, \u03c9) for any time t. We need the initial conditions for the model (2),(3):\ns(0, \u03c9) = s0 (\u03c9) = S0 ps (0, \u03c9), I(0) = I0 .\n\n(4)\n\nHere S0 , I0 are given numbers, and ps (0, \u03c9) is a given initial distribution of the susceptibility in the population.\n3\n\n\fWe note that formally, after integrating equation (2) with respect to \u03c9, we obtain\na homogeneous SI model with non-constant transmission parameter \u03b2\u0304(t) which, in its\nturn, depends on the current distribution of susceptibility in the population. If \u03b2\u0304(t) is\nknown then the problem is solved. Interesting to remark that ad hoc approach to use\ntime-dependent transmission coefficient \u03b2(t) in an SIR model was used to approximate a\nheterogeneous epidemics with a mean-field model [16].\nModel II. Let us assume now that not only the susceptibles are heterogeneous for\nsome trait that influences the disease evolution, but also the infectives are heterogeneous, and consider the simplest possible SI model. Let s(t, \u03c91 ) and i(t, \u03c92 ) be the\ndensities of the susceptibles and infectives respectively, here we assume that the traits\nof the two classes are independent, i.e., \u03b2(\u03c91 , \u03c92 ) = \u03b21 (\u03c91 )\u03b22 (\u03c92 ). The number of susceptibles with the trait value \u03c91 infected by individuals with trait value \u03c92 is given by\n\u03b21 (\u03c91 )s(t, \u03c91 )\u03b22 (\u03c92R)i(t, \u03c92 ), and the total change in the infective class with trait value\n\u03c92 is \u03b22 (\u03c92 )i(t, \u03c92 ) \u03a91 \u03b21 (\u03c91 )s(t, \u03c91 ) d\u03c91; an analogous expression applies to the change in\nthe susceptible population. We emphasize that nothing else except for the standard law of\nmass action is supposed to formulate the terms for the change in susceptible and infective\nsubpopulations. Combining the above assumptions we obtain the following model:\nZ\n\u2202\n\u03b22 (\u03c92 )i(t, \u03c92 ) d\u03c92\ns(t, \u03c91 ) = \u2212\u03b21 (\u03c91 )s(t, \u03c91 )\n\u2202t\n\u03a92\n= \u2212\u03b21 (\u03c91 )s(t, \u03c91 )\u03b2\u03042 (t)I(t),\nZ\n(5)\n\u2202\n\u03b21 (\u03c91 )s(t, \u03c91 ) d\u03c91\ni(t, \u03c92 ) = \u03b22 (\u03c92 )i(t, \u03c92 )\n\u2202t\n\u03a91\n= \u03b22 (\u03c92 )i(t, \u03c92 )\u03b2\u03041 (t)S(t).\nModel (5) is supplemented with the initial conditions s(0, \u03c91) = S0 ps (0, \u03c91 ), i(0, \u03c92 ) =\nI0 pi (0, \u03c92).\nIn (5) it is assumed that if an individual having trait value \u03c91 was infected by an\nindividual with trait value \u03c92 he or she becomes an infective with trait value \u03c92 . This\nis a restrictive assumptions which is necessary to apply the main theorem from the next\nsection.\nThe global dynamics of (5), as well as of (2)-(4), is simple and is similar to the simplest\nhomogeneous SI model.\nModel III. Above we were talking about heterogeneity of the hosts: whether all susceptible individuals are of the same type with equal susceptibility, and whether all infectious\nindividuals have equal ability to infect others. Another aspect of heterogeneity is the possible heterogeneous social contact network [1]. It is difficult to apply the general theory\nof heterogeneous populations (see below) to such models, however, there is a simple case,\nfor which some results can be obtained.\n4\n\n\fLet us assume that n(t, \u03c9) denotes the density of individuals in the population, which\nare making \u03c9 contacts on average. Every individual can be contacted by another individual, which differs is an average number of contact per individual. This situation is usually\ntermed as separable mixing. If we denote r the probability of transmission the disease\ngiven a contact, then, the simplest SI-model with separable mixing can be described by\nthe following system:\nR\n\u03c9i(t, \u03c9)d\u03c9\n\u2202\ns(t, w) = \u2212r\u03c9s(t, \u03c9) R\u03a9\n,\n\u2202t\n\u03c9n0 (\u03c9)d\u03c9\n\u03a9\nR\n(6)\n\u03c9i(t, \u03c9)d\u03c9\n\u2202\n\u03a9\ni(t, w) = \u2212r\u03c9s(t, \u03c9) R\n,\n\u2202t\n\u03c9n\n(\u03c9)d\u03c9\n0\n\u03a9\n\nwhere s(t, \u03c9) + i(t, \u03c9) = n0 (\u03c9) for any t, and n0 (\u03c9) is a given density which specifies\nprobability density function of contact distribution. Using the property that i(t, \u03c9) =\nn0 (\u03c9) \u2212 s(t, \u03c9), we obtain\nR\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u03c9s(t, \u03c9)d\u03c9\n\u2202\n\u03a9\nR\ns(t, w) = \u2212r\u03c9s(t, \u03c9) 1 \u2212\n.\n(7)\n\u2202t\n\u03c9n0 (\u03c9)d\u03c9\n\u03a9\n\nModels (2)-(4), (5), and (7) are infinite dimensional dynamical systems. The special form of the models, however, allows us to use well developed tools of the theory of\nheterogeneous populations, which are presented in the following section.\n\n3\n\nSome facts from the theory of heterogeneous populations\n\nHere we present some results from the theory of heterogeneous populations in the form\nsuitable for our goal noting that more general cases can be analyzed [13]. For the proofs\nwe refer to [15], where similar models are considered.\nLet us assume that there are two interacting populations whose dynamics depend on\ntrait values \u03c91 and \u03c92 respectively.R The densities are given by Rn1 (t, \u03c91 ) and n2 (t, \u03c92 ), and\nthe total population sizes N1 (t) = \u03a91 n1 (t, \u03c9) d\u03c91 and N2 (t) = \u03a92 n2 (t, \u03c9) d\u03c92. Obviously,\nmore than two populations can be considered, or some populations may be supposed to\nbe homogeneous. Assume next that the net reproduction rates of the populations have\nthe specific form which is presented below:\n\u2202\nn1 (t, \u03c91 ) = n1 (t, \u03c91 )[f1 (v1 ) + \u03c61 (\u03c91 )g1 (v1 )],\n\u2202t\n\u2202\nn2 (t, \u03c91 ) = n2 (t, \u03c92 )[f2 (v2 ) + \u03c62 (\u03c92 )g2 (v2 )],\n\u2202t\n\n(8)\n\nwhere\nv1 = (N1 , N2 , \u03c6\u03042 (t)), v2 = (N1 , N2 , \u03c6\u03041 (t)), \u03c6i (\u03c9i ) are given functions, \u03c6\u0304i (t) =\nR\n\u03c6\n(\u03c9\ni )pi (t, \u03c9i ) d\u03c9i are the mean values of \u03c6i (\u03c9i ), and pi (t, \u03c9i ) = ni (t, \u03c9i )/Ni (t) are the\n\u03a9i i\n5\n\n\fcorresponding pdfs, i = 1, 2. We also assume that \u03c6i (\u03c9i ), considered as random variables,\nare independent. The system (8) plus the initial conditions\nni (0, \u03c9i ) = Ni (0)pi (0, \u03c9i ), i = 1, 2,\n\n(9)\n\ndefines, in general, a complex transformation of densities ni (t, \u03c9i ). An effective approach\nto analyze models in the form (8) was suggested in [11] (examples of model analysis are\ngiven in [12, 14, 15, 21]).\nLet us denote\nZ\nMi (t, \u03bb) =\ne\u03bb\u03c6i (\u03c9i ) pi (t, \u03c9i ) d\u03c9i , i = 1, 2,\n\u03a9i\n\nthe moment generating functions (mgfs) of the functions \u03c6i (\u03c9i ), Mi (0, \u03bb) are the mgfs of\nthe initial distributions, i = 1, 2, which are given.\nLet us introduce auxiliary variables qi (t) as the solutions of the differential equations\ndqi (t)/dt = gi (vi ),\n\nqi (0) = 0,\n\ni = 1, 2.\n\n(10)\n\nThe following theorem holds\nTheorem 1. Suppose that t \u2208 [0, T ), where T is the maximal value of t such that (8)-(9)\nhas a unique solution. Then\n(i) The current means of \u03c6i (\u03c9i ), i = 1, 2, are determined by the formulas\n\u03c6\u0304i (t) =\n\ndMi (0, \u03bb)\nd\u03bb\n\n\u03bb=qi (t)\n\n1\n,\nMi (0, qi (t))\n\n(11)\n\nand satisfy the equations\nd\n\u03c6\u0304i (t) = gi (vi )\u03c3i2 (t),\ndt\n2\nwhere \u03c3i (t) are the current variances of \u03c6i (t, \u03c9i ), i = 1, 2.\n(ii) The current population sizes N1 (t) and N2 (t) satisfy the system\nd\nNi (t) = Ni (t)[fi (vi ) + \u03c6\u0304i (t)gi (vi )],\ndt\n\ni = 1, 2.\n\n(12)\n\n(13)\n\nFrom Theorem 1 follows that the analysis of model (8)-(9) is reduced to analysis of\nODE system (10),(11),(13), the only thing we need to know is the mgfs of the initial\ndistributions.\nConcluding this sections we note that, with obvious notation changes, models (2)-(4)\nand (5) fall into the general framework of the master model (8).\n\n6\n\n\f4\n\nModel analysis\n\nWe start with the model (2)-(4), which, according to Theorem 1, can be written in the\nform\nd\nS(t) = \u2212\u03b2\u0304(t)S(t)I(t), S(0) = S0 ,\ndt\nd\nI(t) = \u03b2\u0304(t)S(t)I(t), I(0) = I0 ,\ndt\nd\nq(t) = \u2212I(t), q(0) = 0,\ndt\ndM(0, \u03bb)\n1\n\u03b2\u0304(t) =\n.\nd\u03bb\n\u03bb=q(t) M(0, q(t))\n\n(14)\n\nM(0, \u03bb) is a given mgf of ps (0, \u03c9).\nProposition 1. Model (14) is equivalent to the following model:\nd\nS(t) = \u2212h(S(t))I(t), S(0) = S0 ,\ndt\nd\nI(t) = h(S(t))I(t), I(0) = I0 .\ndt\nwhere\nh(S) = S0\n\n\"\n\ndM \u22121 (0, \u03be)\nd\u03be\n\n\u03be=S/S0\n\n#\u22121\n\n,\n\n(15)\n\n(16)\n\nand M \u22121 (0, \u03be) is the inverse function to mgf M(0, \u03bb).\nProof. The first equation in (14) can be rewritten in the form\n1 d\nd\nS(t) = \u03b2\u0304(t) q(t) .\nS(t) dt\ndt\n\u03b2\u0304(t) can be represented as \u03b2\u0304(t) =\n\nd ln M (0,\u03bb)\nd\u03bb\n\n\u03bb=q(t)\n\n, which gives\n\nd ln S(t)\nd\n=\nln M(0, q(t)),\ndt\ndt\nor, using the initial conditions S(0) = S0 , q(0) = 0,\nS(t)/S0 = M(0, q(t)),\n\n(17)\n\nwhich is the first integral to system (14). Knowledge of a first integral allows to reduce\nthe order of the system by one. Since M(0, \u03bb) is an absolutely monotone function in the\ncase of nonnegative \u03b2(\u03c9) > 0, then it follows that\nq(t) = M \u22121 (0, S(t)/S0) ,\n7\n\n(18)\n\n\fwhere M \u22121 (0, M(0, \u03bb)) = \u03bb for any \u03bb.\nPutting (18) into (14) gives\ndM(0, \u03bb)\nd\nS(t) =\ndt\nd\u03bb\n\nS0 I(t),\n\u03bb=M \u22121 (0,S(t)/S0 )\n\nor, by the inverse function theorem, (15) with (16).\nNote that model (5) can be reduced to four-dimensional system of ODEs, which, in\nits turn, can be simplified to two-dimensional system. The proof is as in Proposition 1.\nFormally, we have\nProposition 2. The model (5) is equivalent to the model\nd\nS(t) = \u2212h1 (S)h2 (I),\ndt\nd\nI(t) = h1 (S)h2 (I),\ndt\nwhere hi (x), i = 1, 2 are given by (16).\nCombining together Propositions 1 and 2 we obtain the main result of the present\nnote.\nTheorem 2. A heterogeneous SI model in the form (2)-(4), or in the form (5), which\nboth describe the contact process with the help of the law of mass action and model heterogeneities in disease parameters such as susceptibility to a disease or infectivity of an\nindividual, are equivalent to a homogeneous SI model with a nonlinear transmission function.\nAn analogous conjecture was made in [27], where a substantially more complex model\nis analyzed. The strength of Theorem 2 is that it provides an explicit form for the\nnonlinear transmission function.\nConsider a standard gamma distribution with parameters k and \u03bd:\np(0, \u03c9) =\n\n\u03bd k k\u22121 \u2212\u03bd\u03c9\n\u03c9 e ,\n\u0393(k)\n\n\u03c9 > 0, k > 0, \u03bd > 0.\n\n(19)\n\nLet us assume that \u03b2(\u03c9) = \u03c9. The mgf of gamma-distribution is then\nM(0, \u03bb) = (1 \u2212 \u03bb/\u03bd)\u2212k .\nUsing Proposition 1 we obtain that\n\u0014 \u00151/k\nkS S\n.\nh(S) =\n\u03bd S0\nFrom (20) it immediately follows\n8\n\n(20)\n\n\fCorollary 1. The power relationship (1) with q = 1, p = 1 + 1/k can be obtained as a\nconsequence of the heterogenous SI model with distributed susceptibility when the initial\ndistribution is a gamma-distribution with parameters k and \u03bd.\nCorollary 2. The power relationship (1) with q = 1 + 1/k2 , p = 1 + 1/k1 can be obtained\nas a consequence of the heterogenous SI model with distributed susceptibility and infectivity\nwhen the initial susceptibility distribution is a gamma-distribution with parameters k1 and\n\u03bd1 , and the initial infectivity distribution is a gamma-distribution with parameters k2 and\n\u03bd2 .\nSummarizing, we provided a mechanistic derivation of the power law transmission\nfunction, which was used phenomenologically in many epidemiological models, in the\ncase when heterogeneity parameters p, q exceed one. Originally, these exponents were\nconsidered to be less than one (e.g., in [25] they are put in the form p = 1 \u2212 a, q = 1 \u2212 b),\nbut no comparison with real world data was provided.\nThere is no universal agreement on the values of parameters p, q in (1). In [24] these\nparameters were estimated when the incidence rate was inferred from epidemic simulations\non random networks with different degree distributions. In all experiments values of p\nand q were estimated to be less than 1. In contrast to the last observation, in [26], where\nthe transmission function has the form T (S, I) = \u03b2S p I, it was argued that the exponent p\nshould be greater than one. Fitting the solutions of the mean field model with nonlinear\ntransmission function into the data obtained from large-scale simulations, it was found\nthat p can range from 1.6 to 2.\nIn any respect, the question of deriving the power law transmission function on a solid\nmechanistic bases for the case p, q < 1 remains open, whereas the case p, q > 1 is fully\ncovered by Corollaries 1 and 2.\n\n5\n\nModel III and separable mixing\n\nWe rewrite equation (7) in the form\n\u0015\n\u0014\n\u03c9\u0304(t)S(t)\n\u2202\n,\ns(t, w) = \u2212r\u03c9s(t, \u03c9) 1 \u2212\n\u2202t\nK\n\n(21)\n\nwhere K is the number of contacts, which are made by the total population, \u03c9\u0304(t) is the\naverage number of contacts made by one susceptible individual at time t. We note that\nformally eq. (21) is not covered by Theorem 1, because its growth coefficient depends on\nthe average parameter value \u03c9\u0304(t). However, it is possible to extend the theory presented in\nSection 3 to such cases with minor changes in notations (Karev, personal communication).\nIn particular, it is possible to show that equation (21) is equivalent to the following\nordinary differential equation:\n\u0015\n\u0014\nd\nh(S)\n,\n(22)\nS(t) = \u2212rh(S) 1 \u2212\ndt\nK\n9\n\n\fwhere h(S) is given by (16).\nIt is interesting to note that we can compare solutions of (21) with solutions of the\nsystem of ODEs, obtained as a result of large mixing rates in the model on dynamic\ncontact network [28]. For SI-model system (2.22)-(2.23) from the cited work reads\n\u03b8\u0307 = \u2212rMI \u03b8,\nrMI\n\u1e40I = \u2032 (\u03b8g \u2032 (\u03b8) + \u03b82 g \u2032\u2032 (\u03b8)),\ng (1)\n\n(23)\n\nwhere g(x) is the probability generation function for the\nR distribution of the number of\ncontacts in the population (this is PGF for pdf n0 (\u03c9)/ \u03a9 n0 (\u03c9)d\u03c9); \u03b8(t) is the fraction\nof individuals that have only one contact and still susceptible by the time t; r is the\ntransmission rate; and MI is the fraction of contacts made by infected individuals. The\nnumber of susceptible individuals is given by S(t) = g(\u03b8(t)).\nTo compare models (22) and (23) we need to specify the initial conditions. Since\nmodel (23) deals with PGF of the number of contacts of the total population, and eq.\n(22) incorporates mgf of the number of contacts of susceptible individuals it is reasonable\nto expect some discrepancy of the corresponding solutions if we use the same pdf for these\npurposes. See Fig. 1 for three solutions.\nAs can be seen from Fig. 1 the best agreement os found when we use \u03bb = 1, i.e., the\naverage number of contacts equals to 1. In this case two solutions coincide. In the cases\n\u03bb > 1 or \u03bb < 1 there is some divergence, although the limiting behavior of the models is\nthe same.\n\n10\n\n\fFigure 1: Comparison of the solutions of system (23) (red line) with solution of eq. (22)\n(yellow bold line). Poisson distribution was used with parameters \u03bb = 1, 1.5, 0.5 from\ntop to bottom. r = 2. It was assumed that the population size is N = 1000. The\ninitial conditions for problem (23) were chosen such that \u03b8(0) = 1 \u2212 \u03b5, MI (0) = \u03b5, where\n\u03b5 = 0.01. S(0) for (22) was found as g(1 \u2212 \u03b5). The dotted line shows Np0 , where p0 is\nthe proportion of individuals in the population who do not make the contacts\n\n11\n\n\fReferences\n[1] S. Bansal, B. T. Grenfell, and L. A. Meyers.
