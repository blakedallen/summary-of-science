The electronic structure was analyzed within the tight-binding approximation, and the\nSlonczewski-Weiss-McClure (SWM) parameters were obtained from the analysis of the dispersive\nbehavior of the Raman features.

This effect has been demonstrated experimentally at the \u0393 point of monolayer and\nbilayer graphene using gated Raman scattering experiments [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]. However, the electron-phonon\ncoupling is expected to be stronger at the K point [1], but\nRaman experiments in graphene systems performed with\nvisible light cannot probe phonons near the K point [5].\nMoreover, in the case of AB-stacked bilayer graphene,\ndue to its special electronic and phonon structure [9], Raman experiments involve phonons closer to the K point\nwhen compared to monolayer graphene [10]. This work\npresents a resonance Raman investigation of AB-stacked\nbilayer graphene using many laser lines in the nearinfrared (near-IR) and visible range. The Kohn anomaly\nfor both symmetric (S) and anti-symmetric (AS) phonons\nwas evidenced, and results show the importance of considering higher renormalization terms such as electronelectron interactions to correctly describe the phonon dispersion near the K point [11]. These effects are especially\nrelevant for understanding the dispersion of electrons and\nphonons [12, 13, 14] and transport properties in this novel\nmaterial [9].\nIn a previous resonance Raman study of bilayer\ngraphene performed in the visible range [15], the electronic structure of bilayer graphene was probed by analyzing the dispersion of G\u2032 Raman band (also called 2D\nband) as a function of the laser energy, and described\nwithin a tight-binding approximation [16, 17, 18] by determining the nearest-neighbors hopping parameters \u03b30 ,\n\u03b31 , \u03b33 and \u03b34 . It was shown in this work that a linear\niTO phonon dispersion provided a good fit of the experimental data obtained with visible photons [15].\nIn the present work, we have extended the range of\nlaser energies, measuring the G\u2032 Raman band with many\nlaser lines in the range 1.33 to 2.81 eV. The measurements\n\nin the near-IR range (1.33 to 1.69 eV) are especially relevant since we can probe phonons that are much closer to\nthe K point. The analysis of the low energy data allowed\nus to observe a non-linear softening of the phonon branch\nnear the K point, and the significant splitting of the symmetric (S) and anti-symmetric (AS) phonon branches. In\nparticular, we show that the phonon softening is stronger\nfor the S branch. Concerning the electronic structure, we\nhave also considered the in-plane second-neighbor hopping parameter, which is expected to be of the same order as the out-of-plane nearest-neighbor parameters, to\ndescribe the G\u2032 Raman band dispersion.\nThe graphene samples used in this experiment were\nobtained by a micro-mechanical exfoliation of graphite\n(Nacional de Grafite, Brazil) on the surface of a Si sample with a 300 nm SiO2 coverage. The laser power was\nkept at 1 mW in order to avoid sample heating. We used\nHe-Cd, Ar-Kr and dye lasers for the laser lines in the visible range (1.91\u20132.81 eV) and a Ti:Saphire laser for the\nexcitation in the near-IR range (1.33\u20131.69 eV).\nFigure 1 shows the G\u2032 band of bilayer graphene\nrecorded with 19 different laser lines between 1.33 and\n2.81 eV (932 to 440 nm). We can see that both the position and the shape of the G\u2032 band are strongly dependent on the energy of the exciting laser. The G\u2032 band in\ngraphene systems comes from an intervalley double resonance (DR) Raman process [19, 20] that involves one initial electronic state with wavevector k near the K point,\none intermediate electronic state with wavevector k \u2032 near\nthe K\u2032 point, and two in-plane transverse optical (iTO)\nphonons with wavevectors q = k + k \u2032 [10]. Since photons\nwith different energies excite electrons and phonons with\ndifferent wavevectors k and q, respectively, the dispersion\nof electrons and phonons near the K point can be measured in when the energy of the incident photons can be\ntuned [10].\nIn the case of AB-stacked bilayer graphene, the electronic branches split into two valence bands (\u03c01 and \u03c02 )\nand two conduction bands (\u03c01\u2217 and \u03c02\u2217 ) [9].

Since the lower and upper conduction\nbands (\u03c01\u2217 and \u03c02\u2217 ) belong to different irreducible representations, the S phonons (T1 symmetry) are associated\nwith the P11 and P22 processes [see Fig. 2(a)] involving\nelectrons with same symmetry (\u03c01\u2217 \u2192 \u03c01\u2217 or \u03c02\u2217 \u2192 \u03c02\u2217 )\nwhereas the AS phonons (T2 symmetry) occur for processes P12 and P21 [Fig. 2(b)] involving electrons with\ndifferent symmetries (\u03c01\u2217 \u2192 \u03c02\u2217 or \u03c02\u2217 \u2192 \u03c01\u2217 ) [15].\nEach of these processes (P11 , P22 , P12 and P21 ) is\nresponsible for one peak in the G\u2032 band of AB-stacked\nbilayer graphene. Fig. 2(c) shows the Raman spectrum\nof the G\u2032 band measured with 1.57 eV laser energy and\nfitted with four peaks. All have the same FWHM of\n24 cm\u22121 , which is the FWHM of the single band in monolayer graphene [10, 24]. We see in Fig.2(a) that the\nP11 process involves the phonon with higher wavevector, while the phonon with smaller wavevector gives rise\nto the P22 process. Therefore, the P22 process is especially relevant since it involves phonons closer to the K\npoint, even when compared to the phonon in monolayer\ngraphene probed by the same laser line. Since the iTO\nphonon frequency increases with increasing q, we conclude that the lowest and highest frequency peaks of the\nG\u2032 band are associated with the P11 and P22 processes,\nrespectively. The two intermediate Raman peaks are due\nto the P12 and P21 processes, as shown in Fig.2(c).\nAll G\u2032 bands shown in Fig.1 were fitted by four\nLorentzian curves, and laser energy dependence of the\nLorentzian peak positions are plotted in Fig.3(a-d).

(d) Bilayer graphene atomic structure showing the\nhopping processes associated with first-neighbor interactions\n(\u03b30 , \u03b31 , \u03b33 and \u03b34 ), and second neighbor interaction t\u2032 .\n\npeaks shown in Fig.3(a-d), we need to consider the dispersion of both electrons and phonons near the K point.\nThe electronic dispersion will be analyzed here using the\ntight-binding approximation, which was first introduced\nby Wallace [18], using the Slonczewski-Weiss-McClure\n(SWM) [16, 17] model for graphite, and the phonon dispersion is obtained from the fit of the experimental data.\nIn the previous resonance Raman study in bilayer\ngraphene performed in the visible range [15], a linear\nphonon dispersion was considered to fit the G\u2032 peak positions versus Elaser data. Fig. 3(a) shows that the fitting\nof the data of the present study considering the linear\nphonon dispersion and the SWM parameters used in reference [15] fails for the experimental points in the near-IR\nregion and, in particular, for the data associated with the\nP22 process involving phonons closer to the K point.\nIn order to fit the low energy experimental data in Fig.\n3, we have considered a non-linear relation for the iTO\nphonon dispersion, given by a second-order polynomial\nw(q) = A + Bq + Cq 2 . Fig.3(b) shows the fit considering the same non-linear phonon dispersion for the S\nand AS phonon branches, and the \u03b30 , \u03b31 , \u03b33 , \u03b34 parameters. Fig.3(c) shows the fit using the same SWM parameters as in Fig.3(b) but considering two distinct non-linear\nphonon dispersions for the S and AS branches. As we\ncan see in Fig.3(b) and (c), the fitting in the low energy\nrange is improved considering the non-linear dispersion,\nbut different dispersions for the S and AS branches are\nneeded to obtain a good fit of the experimental data. All\nfitting parameters are shown in Table I.\nIn the fittings shown in Figs. 3(a)-(c), we have considered only the first-neighbor parameters \u03b30 , \u03b31 , \u03b33 , \u03b34 . In\nprinciple, we could also introduce higher-order terms and,\nin particular, the in-plane second-neighbor parameter t\u2032 ,\n\n\f3\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\n(d)\n\nFIG. 3: Laser energy dependence of the peaks of the G\u2032 bands,\nfitted considering four different approximations.

All fitting parameters used in approximations (a), (b),\n(c) and (d) are shown in Table I.\n\nwhich is expected to be of the same order of magnitude as\nthe out-of-plane first-neighbor parameters. Figure 3(d)\nshows the fit of the experimental data considering also t\u2032\nand \u2206, which represents the difference in energy of the\nsublattices A and B. As we observe in Figure 3(d), the\nresultant fit is slightly improved, mainly due to the use\nof larger number of fitting parameters.\nIt is important to emphasize that slightly different values of the \u03b3 parameters are found when we include t\u2032 and\n\u2206. A good fit can always be obtained for \u03b30 values ranging between 2.9 and 3.1 eV. Concerning the \u03b31 parameter,\nreasonable fits could only be obtained for \u03b31 < 0.35 eV, in\ndisagreement with values of \u03b31 up to 0.4 eV proposed in\nthe literature [25, 26, 27]. Considering the \u03b33 parameter,\nthe best fit is obtained when \u03b33 \u2248 0.1 eV, and a reasonable fit cannot be obtained for values of \u03b33 > 0.15 eV.\nOnce again, this value is smaller than others found in the\ngraphite literature (\u03b33 \u2248 0.30 eV [28, 29, 30]). Recent\ninfrared studies in exfoliated bilayer graphene consider\n\u03b33 \u2248 0.30 eV [31, 32], but this value is not extracted\ndirectly from the experiments [25, 27]. Notice that \u03b33\nis related to the trigonal warping effect (TWE) at very\nlow energies and gives rise to electron-hole pockets [33]\nin the energy scale of \u223c 2 meV, which is not accessible\nin Raman experiments. However as the energy increases,\nthere is also a TWE due to the symmetry of the lattice,\nwhich is probed by our experiment. These two effects\n\ncan explain the different \u03b33 values found with distinct\nexperimental techniques.\nIf we consider only nearest neighbor parameters to describe the electronic structure, the best fit is obtained for\n\u03b34 \u2248 0.15 eV, which is in close agreement with our previous experiment [15] and with Refs. [25, 26]. However,\nsmaller values of \u03b34 provide a good fit when the secondneighbor t\u2032 parameter is included. In fact, both \u03b34 and t\u2032\nparameters are associated with the asymmetry between\nelectrons and holes in bilayer graphene. Finally, reasonable fits can be obtained for different small positive and\nnegative values of \u2206 (|\u2206| < 0.01eV).\nThe analysis of the experimental data also gives us\nthe phonon dispersion for the symmetric (S) and antisymmetric (AS) iTO phonon branches near the K point.\nAs shown in Figs. 3(c) and (d), two distinct phonon\nbranches, associated with symmetric and anti-symmetric\niTO phonons, are necessary to fit the experimental data.\nThe values of the polynomial parameters A, B and C for\nthe S and AS branches are shown in Table I. We observe\nthat the quadratic coefficients C assume negative values,\nshowing that the slope of the phonon dispersion increases\nwith decreasing q values. This is direct evidence of the\nKohn anomaly for the iTO phonon branches, which are\nexpected to exhibit a kink at the K point.\nThe experimental data shown in Fig. 3 can be directly plotted in a phonon energy dispersion relation\n(\u03c9ph versus q) by eliminating the laser energy (Elaser )\nin the double resonance conditions [15]. Fig. 4 shows\nthe phonon dispersion of the S (full circles) and AS\n(open circles) branches obtained from the resonance Raman results, considering the same TB parameters as in\nFig.3(c). Fig. 4 also shows the theoretical phonon dispersion near the Dirac point of the iTO phonon branch\nof monolayer graphene calculated using the tight-binding\napproximation by Popov et al. [34] (solid curve) and using DFT by Lazzeri et al. [11] (dashed curve) within\nthe GW approximation, where electron-electron interaction is taken into account. Notice that the phonon dispersion calculated by tight-binding fails to describe the\ndata for lower phonon energies, which are in good agreement with the calculations within the GW approximation. This result shows the importance of considering\nelectron-phonon and electron-electron interactions in order to correctly describe the phonon dispersion near the\nK point of graphene systems.\nAnother interesting observation is the fact that the\nphonon softening is stronger for the S phonon branch\nas shown in Fig. 4. This result is in agreement with\nthe calculation performed by Ando et al. [35], which\npredicts a stronger phonon renormalization for the zonecenter symmetric phonon, due to distinct selection rules\nfor interaction of S and AS phonons with intra-valley and\ninter-valley electron-hole pairs. The same type of selection rule is expected to occur for phonons near the K\npoint.\nIn summary, the dispersion of electrons and phonons\nof bilayer graphene was investigated by performing a res-\n\n\f4\nTABLE I: Values of the SWM parameters (in units of eV) and the iTO phonon dispersion parameters (w(q) = A + Bq + Cq 2 )\nobtained from the four different fits of the experimental data shown in Fig.3 (a), (b), (c) and (d).\nsymmetric\nanti-symmetric\n2\n2\n\u03b30\n\u03b31\n\u03b33\n\u03b34\n\u2206\nt\u2032\nA(meV) B(meV\u00c5) C(meV\u00c5 ) A(meV) B(meV\u00c5) C(meV\u00c5 )\n(a)\n(b)\n(c)\n(d)\n\n2.9\n3.0\n3.0\n3.0\n\n0.3\n0.35\n0.35\n0.35\n\n0.1\n0.1\n0.1\n0.1\n\n0.12\n0.15\n0.15\n0.10\n\n0.01\n\n0.15\n\n153.7\n149.3\n146.3\n146.3\n\nFIG. 4: (Color online) Experimental iTO phonon dispersion\nof bilayer graphene near the K point of the S (full circles)\nand AS (open circles) branches.

The\nmeasurements in the near-IR range are especially relevant since we can probe phonons that are much closer\nto the K point. The electronic structure was analyzed\nwithin the tight-binding approximation, considering first\nand second neighbor interactions. We have obtained accurate experimental data for the phonon dispersion of the\niTO branches near the K point, and the phonon branch\nsoftening reveals the K point Kohn anomaly in bilayer\ngraphene. We have shown that the phonon renormalization is stronger for the S phonon branch. Our results\nagree with the phonon dispersion calculation which takes\ninto account electron-electron interaction in graphene\nsystems, which plays an important role to correctly describe the Kohn anomaly near the K point.\nThis work was supported by Rede Nacional de Pesquisa\nem Nanotubos de Carbono - MCT, and the Brazilian\nAgencies CNPq and FAPEMIG.
