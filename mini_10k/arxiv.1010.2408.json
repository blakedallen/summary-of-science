In the\nclassical wave physics, the problem can be explained simply by a fact that the pure additive or subtractive interference never occurs in the real experiments.

INTRODUCTION\n\nThe additive and subtractive interference of waves is a basic phenomenon in the classical wave physics. If two\nwaves having the same amplitudes are made to interfere only destructively, then the waves and the energy associated\nwith these waves do vanish. The pure constructive interference of two waves would produce a wave with the energy\nfour times larger the single wave. The increase or annihilation of the wave energy by the positive or negative crosscorrelation term inducing by the interference would contradict the conservation of energy. The cross-correlation\n(interference) term that increases or decreases the energy logically to call the cross-correlation energy. In the classical\nwave physics, the problem connected with the energy nonconservation by the cross-correlation is usually explained\nby mentioning a fact that the pure additive or subtractive interference never happens in the real experiments. The\nalternately constructive and destructive interference of waves in the experiments redistributes spatially the local\nenergy (intensity) of waves, while the total energy of waves remains constant. The problem of energy nonconservation\nappears again if the amplitude and phase conditions of the pure additive or subtractive interference have been created\nin the appropriate physical system, for instance, in a subwavelength set-up or inside a resonator cavity. In such a\ncase, the interference-induced positive or negative cross-correlation energy, which is the \"nonexistent energy\" from\nthe point of view of both the classical and quantum physics, violates the energy conservation.\nIn the past, the problem associated with the cross-correlation energy has been considered in quantum mechanics\nunder the study of interference of particles of matter in the context of the double-slit experiment (see, textbooks). If\nthe particle waves interfere in such an experiment as particles, then on the basis of the exclusively additive nature\nof particles, the density of interfering particles is expected to be equal to the sum of those before the interference.\nHowever, it was found experimentally that the interference changes the local density of particles. This can be explained\nonly by the alternately additive and subtractive interference (cross-correlation) of the particle waves. According to\nthe classical wave physics, the pure constructive or destructive interference could result into violation of the energy\n\n\f2\nconservation in the interfering waves. To overcome the problem Paul Dirac has suggested that interference between\ntwo different particles (photons [1, 2]) never occurs [3]: \"... Suppose we have a beam of light consisting of a large\nnumber of photons split up into two components of equal intensity. On the assumption that the beam is connected\nwith the probable number of photons in it, we should have half the total number going into each component. If the\ntwo components are now made to interfere, we should require a photon in one component to be able to interfere with\none in the other. Sometimes these two photons would have to annihilate one another and other times they would\nhave to produce four photons. This would contradict the conservation of energy. The new theory, which connects the\nwave-function with probabilities for one photon gets over the difficulty by making each photon go partly into each of the\ntwo components. Each photon then interferes only with itself. Interference between two different photons never occurs.\n...\" [4]. In the Dirac model of the \"interference-less\" particles, the main reason of exclusion of the interference between\nthe \"self-interfering\" particles is the requirement of conservation of the number and energy of particles. According\nto the Copenhagen-Dirac model of quantum interference, the probability amplitude attributed to the wave-function\nof a particle in the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics must be used to calculate the likelihood of a\nsingle particle (photon) to be in a particular single-particle Fock state. Another way in which probability can be\napplied to the behavior of particles is calculation of the probable number of photons in a particular state. Although\nthe modern physics does use mainly the Dirac (traditional) interpretation based on the Copenhagen interpretation of\nquantum mechanics, the former model was also applied, for instance, for coherent states and statistical mixtures of\nsuch, as thermal light. The model allows existence of the interference between two different states (wave-functions).\nTherefore, formally, the energy conservation can be violated by the cross-correlation of states (particles).\nIn the classical wave physics, the cross-correlation term (energy) plays a key role in description of the pure constructive or destructive interference. The Copenhagen-Dirac (canonical) interpretation of the double-slit quantum\nexperiment in terms of the \"interference-less\" particles, namely the self-interfering particles that never interfere with\neach other, has solved the problem of the energy nonconservation, but at the price of exclusion of the cross-correlation\nenergy from quantum mechanics and particle field theory. The Copenhagen-Dirac postulate, which is the viable, if nonintuitive, opinion, has been suggested well before the modern understanding of quantum mechanics. Nevertheless, the\nhuge progress of the quantum mechanics and quantum field theory based on the concept (postulate) of the \"interferenceless\" (self-interfering) particles completely justified the Copenhagen-Dirac model of quantum interference. Although\nthe problem associated with violation of the energy conservation by the cross-correlation energy has been solved by\nDirac, the several principal questions remain unexplained up to now. For instance, in the quantum\nPN mechanics and\nquantum electrodynamics, the wave-functions \u03c8n (r, t) of the N particles are not additive [\u03c8(r, t)6= n=1 \u03c8n (r, t)] due\nto non-additivity of the probability amplitudes associated with the wave-functions of particles in the Copenhagen\ninterpretation of quantum mechanics. In other words, the waves of probabilities associated with the wave-functions\nof particles are not additive because the particles never interfere with each other. In the classical electrodynamics,\nhowever, the electromagnetic field of the N electromagnetic fields (waves) is considered as a sum (superposition) of the\ninterfering electric [En (r, t)] and magnetic [Hn (r, t)] fields or the respective derivatives of the electromagnetic fourPN\nPN\nPN\npotential [A\u03bcn (r, t)] fields: E(r, t) = n=1 En (r, t), H(r, t) = n=1 Hn (r, t), and A\u03bc (r, t) = n=1 A\u03bcn (r, t). That\ncontradicts the general correspondence principle that the quantum and classical treatments must be in agreement not\nonly for a very large number of particles (photons). The electric, magnetic and vector-potential fields of a particle\n(photon) in quantum electrodynamics are not attributed to the probability amplitude of the wave of probability associated with the wave-function of the photon. Strictly speaking, the generally accepted wave-function of a photon\ndoes not exist up to now. Furthermore, the traditional interpretation of quantum interference forbids existence of\nthe cross-correlation energy (each particle interferes only with itself), while the classical wave physics does use this\nenergy in description of the pure additive or subtractive interference. Thus the field energy calculated by using the\ncanonical interpretation of the quantum interference would never approach the classical value for the pure constructive\nor destructive interference. In addition, the particle energy \u03b5 = ~\u03c9 + (1/2)~\u03c9 calculated in the quantum field theory\nbased on the Copenhagen-Dirac postulate is different from the Planck-Einstein particle energy \u03b5 = ~\u03c9 [1, 2]. The\nquantum energy (1/2)~\u03c9, which is usually identified as the vacuum energy, does contradict both the Einstein theory\nand classical physics of empty space. In particle field theory based on the Copenhagen-Dirac postulate, the force\nacting upon a particle is seen as the action of the respective gauge field that is present at the particle location. The\nforce is attributed to the exchange of the field virtual particles. Such a physical picture does not compare well with\nthe Einstein theory of general relativity, where the gravitational interaction between two objects (particles) is not\nviewed as a force, but rather, objects moving freely in gravitational fields travel under their own inertia in straight\nlines through curve spacetime [5]. In spite of the Dirac solution of the problem of the nonconservation of energy under\nquantum interference, the nonconservation of the number of particles and energy in quantum field theories based on\nthe Copenhagen-Dirac postulate does remain up to now one of the key problems. The founders of quantum mechanics\nand particle field theory Max Born, Werner Heisenberg, Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger, Pascual Jordan, and Paul Dirac already\n\n\f3\nin the 1930s demonstrated that in perturbative calculations many integrals are divergent resulting in nonconservation\nof the number of particles and energy in quantum fields. Since then the different powerful renormalization procedures\nhave been developed to avoid the divergences (for instance, see Refs. [6\u20139]), but they did not provide the general\nsolution of the problem. One could mention also the problem associated with the superluminal signalling in the\ncanonical quantum mechanics (the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen paradox [10]) that follows from the J.S. Bell inequalities [11], but contradicts the Einstein special relativity. Finally, the Copenhagen interpretation (phylosophy) of the\nde Broglie wave associated with a particle as the wave of probability presents a more or less intuitively transparent\nbackground for the physical interpretation of quantum mechanics. Unfortunately, up to now, it is not completely clear\nhow to interpret physically the wave (field) of operators in particle field theory. In any physical interpretation of the\nwave of operators, the operator would be rather a pure mathematical object than a real physical matter. In addition,\nthe Copenhagen interpretation (philosophy) of the de Broglie wave using the pure mathematical object (probability),\nstrictly speaking, did not solve the problem of physical interpretation of quantum mechanics. The probability or\nthe wave of probability is also rather a pure mathematical object than a real physical substance. In this regard,\none could mention the well-known \"ironic interpretation\" of the canonical quantum mechanics attributing to Richard\nFeynman, \"Shut up and calculate!\". The similar problems do exist also in the quantum field theory based on the\nCopenhagen-Dirac postulate of \"interference-less\", self-interfering particles. With no solution of the aforementioned\nproblems, especially of the problem of nonconservation of the number of particles and energy in quantum fields, it\nappears that an incompatibility exists between the quantum theories and the non-quantum physics (including the\nEinstein theory of relativity). For the detailed descriptions of classical wave physics, canonical quantum mechanics\nand particle field theory see the canonical articles and traditional textbooks [12\u201319] and the references therein.\nIn the present study (Part I and II), the interference between particles and the interference-induced positive and\nnegative cross-correlation energies, which do not exist from the point of view of the canonical quantum mechanics\nand particle field theory, are not ignored. In both the classical and quantum fields of the present model, the twotimes increase of the wave amplitude does increase the wave energy in four times, and the wave with zero amplitude\nhas zero energy. The problem of nonconservation of the energy and number of particles by the cross-correlation is\novercame by taking into consideration the fact that creation of the conditions of the pure additive or subtractive\ninterference of the waves (fields) requires \"additional\" energy that must be added or subtracted from the physical\nsystem. Then the \"additional\" energy does provide conservation of the total energy of the system. In Part I,\nthe Hamiltonians describing the energy mediated by the cross-correlation (interference) in the basic classical and\nquantum fields are derived. The conditions of pure constructive or destructive interference are found by using these\nHamiltonians. The influence of the interference-induced cross-correlation energy on the energy, mass, charge, and\nmomentum of the interfering fields is demonstrated. The calculated particle energy \u03b5 = ~\u03c9 = (p2 c2 + m2 c4 )1/2 is\nequal to the Planck-Einstein energy of the particle, but is different from the value \u03b5 = ~\u03c9 + (1/2)~\u03c9 of traditional\nquantum field theory. The calculated vacuum energy, in agreement with the Einstein and classical physics of the\nempty space, is equal to zero. In the present model, the unit-wave associated with a boson or fermion particle,\nunlike the wave of probability or operators in quantum mechanics or particle field theory, is a real, finite unit-wave\n(unit-field) of the physical matter, whose gradient (\"curvature\") can be changed spatially and/or temporally. The\npresent model suggests the very simple physical interpretations of quantum phenomena. For instance, the physical\ninterpretation of the position-momentum uncertainty of a particle (unit-field) in the present model is different from\nthe some (non-generally accepted) interpretations of quantum mechanics, which are based on the \"compression\" of the\npure mathematical object (probability) associated with a particle by the material boundaries of macroscopic objects.\nIn the present model, the physical mechanism behind the position-momentum uncertainty is attributed simply to the\nincrease of the gradient (spatial \"curvature\") of a real, material unit-field (particle) by interaction and interference\nof the unit-field of the matter (mass-energy) with the boundaries of macroscopic objects. In order to account for the\nwell-known discrepancies between measurements based on the mass of the visible matter in astronomy and cosmology\nand definitions of the mass made through dynamical or general relativistic means, the present model does not need\nin a hypothesis of existence of the \"dark\" mass. In the present model, the \"dark\" cosmological energy-mass as well\nas the well-known spiral cosmological structures are attributed to the cross-correlation energy-mass of the moving\ncosmological objects. According to the present model, the Bell superluminal signals (the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen\nparadox) and the well-known astronomical objects, which propagate with velocities greater than the velocity of light,\ninvolve no physics incompatible with the theory of special relativity. The superluminal velocities, if they do really\nexist, are attributed rather to the physical properties of the unit-field like material mediums than the empty space\n(vacuum) of the Einstein special relativity. It is also shown that the positive or negative gradient of the crosscorrelation energy does mediate the attractive or repulsive forces, respectively. These forces could be connected\nwith the all-known classical and quantum fields, for instance, with the gravitational and Coulomb fields. In the\npresent model, the physical mechanism behind the Bose-Einstein statistics, Fermi-Dirac statistics and Pauli exclusion\n\n\f4\nprinciple is attributed to the attractive and repulsive forces associating with the subtractive and additive interference\n(cross-correlation) of the real unit-waves (bosons or fermions) of the matter. To this end, the model shows a key\nrole of the interference-induced cross-correlation energy in several basic coherent quantum phenomena, such as the\nBose-Einstein condensation, super-radiation, Bosenova effect, superfluidity, superconductivity, supermagnetism, and\nquantum anomalous and fractional Hall effects.\nPart I of the present study is organized as follows. Section (1) provides an introduction to the problem associated\nwith violation of the energy conservation by the cross-correlation energy in the classical and quantum physics under\nthe pure additive or subtractive interference. The solution of the problem by the Copenhagen-Dirac interpretation of\nquantum interference, which forbids both the existence of interference between particles and the interference induced\ncross-correlation energy, is discussed. Motivation of the introduction of the interference between particles (bodies) and\nthe respective cross-correlation energy into classical physics, quantum mechanics and particle field theory is presented.\nIn Sec. (2), the energy conservation in the classical and quantum fields under the interference of fields is considered\nin the context of Noether's theorem [20, 21]. The Dirac interpretation of violation of the energy conservation under\nquantum interference is reanalyzed by taking into account the energy spent on the creation of the conditions of\npure additive or subtractive interference. The Hamiltonians describing the energy induced by the cross-correlation\n(interference) in the basic classical and quantum fields are derived. The influence of the cross-correlation energy on\nthe basic physical properties of boson and fermion fields is demonstrated. The energy, mass, charge, and momentum\nof the interfering fields are calculated. It is shown that the gradient of the cross-correlation energy induces the\nforces that could be attributed to all known fields, for instance, to the gravitational or Coulomb fields [Sec. (3)].\nThe conditions of pure constructive or destructive interference of classical and quantum fields are found by using\nthe derived Hamiltonians in Sec. (4). The first-order and higher order coherence (interference) and the respective\ncross-correlation energies are discussed. In Sec. (5), the influence of the cross-correlation energy on the basic coherent\nproperties of boson and fermion fields is demonstrated. The section shows a key role of the cross-correlation energy\nin several basic coherent physical phenomena, such as Bose-Einstein condensation, super-radiation, Bosenova effect,\nsuperfluidity, superconductivity, supermagnetism, and quantum anomalous and fractional Hall effects. The traditional\napproach of insertion of the interference and cross-correlation energy of particles into the many-particle models of the\ncanonical quantum mechanics and particle field theory, which strictly forbid the existence of the interference (crosscorrelation) between particles, is illustrated in Sec. 6 by analyzing the traditional consideration of a many-particle\nquantum system. The summary and conclusions are presented in Sec. (7). In order to make the interference between\nparticles and the respective cross-correlation energy understandable not only to experts in the research field, the model\nconcepts are analyzed and reanalyzed in many philosophic, mathematical and physical details in the context of each\nsection of Secs. (1)-(7).\n2. CROSS-CORRELATION ENERGY IN BOSON AND FERMION FIELDS\n\nThe energy conservation law states that the field energy can be converted from one form to another, but it cannot\nbe created or destroyed. The energy conservation is a mathematical consequence of the shift symmetry of time. More\nabstractly, energy is a generator of continuous time-shift symmetry of the physical system under study. When a\nphysical system has a time-shift symmetry, Noether's theorem [20] implies the existence of a conserved current. The\nthing that \"flows\" in the current is the energy, the energy is the generator of the symmetry group [20, 21]. In the modern\nphysics, the quantum fields are modelled by using simultaneously the energy conservation law and the CopenhagenDirac postulate of \"interference-less\", self-interfering particles [12\u201319]. According to the traditional quantum field\ntheory based on the postulate (interpretation) there is only one global (fundamental) spatially-infinite field of the\nparticles of a specific (particular) kind, which must satisfy both the energy conservation and the \"interference-less\"\nproperties of the self-interfering particles. The particle is created or destroyed by interaction of the field with the\nfundamental (global) field of another kind. For an example, photons of the electromagnetic field are created or\ndestroyed by interaction of the infinite electromagnetic field with the infinite field of electrons. When the fields satisfy\nthe shift symmetry of time, the energy and number of particles are conserved. The interaction of fields results just\ninto redistribution of the energy and number of particles in the space and time. The phenomenon of redistribution of\nthe field energy (intensity) by the interaction of quantum fields is quit similar to the redistribution of the field energy\n(intensity) under the ordinary interference of classical fields. Therefore, the interaction of fields can be considered,\nat least formally, as the interference of fields. Under the canonical quantum interference, however, each particle\ninterferes only with itself. The interference (cross-correlation) between two different particles never occurs. Thus in\nthe modern physics, which is based on the Copenhagen-Dirac postulate of \"interference-less\", self-interfering particles,\nthe interaction of particles is not attributed to the interference and the respective cross-correlation energy of classical or\n\n\f5\nquantum fields. In addition, the boundaries located infinitely far from any spacetime point in the traditional quantum\nfield theory do affect the field energy in this point instantaneously. In other words, movement of the boundaries located\ninfinitely far from the space point does modulate the field in this point with zero time-delay, which is associated with\ninfinite velocity of the signal propagation. If an ensemble of the interacting fields does not satisfy the shift symmetry\nof time, then the system does not conserve the total energy and number of particles.\nIn contrast to the traditional approach, the present model suggests existence of an arbitrary number of the finite\nfields of particular (specific) kinds, for instance, the beams of photons or electrons. The spatially and temporally finite\n(quantum or classical) fields can interfere (cross-correlate) with each other and/or with the finite fields of another\nkind. For instance, the electron fields can interfere with each other, as well as with the photon fields. The interference\nbetween particles does increase or decrease not only the local density of particles, but at the pure additive or subtractive\ninterference creates or destroys the total field energy and number of particles by the cross-correlation. The phenomenon\nof redistribution of the field energy (intensity) by the interaction of classical or quantum fields is considered as the\ninterference of the classical or quantum fields. In the present model, the classical and quantum fields of elementary\nparticles are considered as a superposition of the unit-fields associated with these particles. The material unit-field\n(unit-wave) associated with a particle, in contrast to the non-material wave of probability or operators in quantum\nmechanics or particle field theory, is a real, finite unit-wave (unit-field) of the mass-energy. Under the interference, each\nparticle (unit-wave) can interfere with itself (quantum interference). However, unlike in the canonical quantum models,\nthe unit-fields (particles) could interfere (interact) also with each other (classical interference). Thus the attractive\nor repulsive forces associated with interaction of the particles are associated simultaneously with the classical and\nquantum interference (cross-correlations) of the interfering (interacting) classical or quantum unit-fields. In other\nwords, the positive or negative gradient of the field cross-correlation energy does induce the attractive or repulsive\nforces that redistribute the field energy (intensity). For both the classical and quantum waves (fields), the two-times\nincrease of the wave amplitude does increase the wave energy in four times and the wave with zero amplitude has\nzero energy. In the frame of such an approach, the quantum and classical treatments of the fields are in agreement\nwith each other for an arbitrary number of particles. It should be stressed that the physical system of the interfering\n(interacting) fields includes not only the interfering fields, but also the environment (material boundaries) that could\nprovide the pure constructive or destructive interference. In other words, the fields and unit-fields (particles) do\ninterfere and interact not only with each other, but also with the particles of boundaries of the physical system.\nAlthough the field energy is changed under the pure constructive or destructive interference of the fields (waves), the\ntotal energy of the physical system is conserved. The pure additive or subtractive interference is provided by the\n\"additional\" energy, which should be added or subtracted from the physical system of interfering fields before the\ninterference of fields with each other. In such a case, the physical system of the interfering (interacting) fields does not\nobey the shift symmetry of time. Therefore, the energy nonconservation associated with the cross-correlation energy\ndoes not contradict the Noether theorem. The energy conservation of the total physical system is provided rather by\nthe exchange of the field energy with the environment (usually, particles of material boundaries) than by the shift\nsymmetry of time. In contrast to the pure additive or subtractive interference, the creation of conditions of the normal\n(not pure constructive or destructive) interference does not require the additional energy. The normal interference is\na reversible process. The energy conservation of the total physical system under the normal interference is provided\nby the shift symmetry of time in the system. Although the cross-correlation (interference) of fields is relevant to the\nuncertainty of momentum and energy of a particle, the uncertainty associated with the cross-correlation should not\nbe confused with the uncertainty attributing to the uncertainty principle [22, 23]. In quantum mechanics, the noncommutation of the momentum operator with the coordinate operator results into the Heisenberg position-momentum\nuncertainty, which means it is impossible to determine simultaneously both the position and momentum of a particle\nwith any great degree of accuracy or certainty. The lack of commutation of the time derivative operator with the\ntime operator itself mathematically results into an uncertainty principle for time and energy: the longer the period\nof time, the more precisely energy can be defined. The problem will be analyzed later [see, Sec. (4.2.)] in details by\nusing the Hamiltonians that include the cross-correlation energy.\n2.1. Boson scalar fields\n2.1.1. Boson scalar fields without the cross-correlation\n\nThe interference-induced cross-correlation energy of classical and quantum electromagnetic fields has been recently\nintroduced and preliminary investigated in Refs. [24](a-c). With the objective of deriving the Hamiltonians that take\ninto account the interference, cross-correlation and cross-correlation energy of particles in other boson and fermion\n\n\f6\nfields under classical or quantum interference, let me begin the analysis with the conventional consideration [12\u201319]\nof an infinite boson scalar (spin s = 0) field \u03c8(r, t), which is described by the Lagrangian density L = (\u2202\u03bc \u03c8 \u2217 )(\u2202 \u03bc \u03c8) \u2212\nm2 \u03c8 \u2217 \u03c8. The dynamics of the field is determined by the Euler-Lagrange equation of motion, which yields the wellknown Klein-Gordon-Fock equation for the complex field \u03c8. The present study follows the theoretical formulation\nand notations of Refs. [12] and [14], which use the natural units ~ = c = 1. Due to the spacetime shift symmetry, the\nfield \u03c8 obeys the conservation laws for the energy and momentum. The Lagrangian density is invariant under the\nU (1) local gauge transformation (\u03c8 \u2192 \u03c8 \u2032 = ei\u03b1 \u03c8) given rise to the conserved current. The continuity equation for\nthe 4-vector Rof the Noether current density j\u03bc = m(\u03c8 \u2217 (\u2202\u03bc \u03c8) \u2212 (\u2202\u03bc \u03c8 \u2217 )\u03c8) yields the conservation of the field charge\n(mass) Q = j0 d3 x. The canonical, non-quantum Hamiltonian of the system is given by\nZ \u221e\nH=\nhd3 x,\n(1)\n0\n\nwhere\nh=\n\n\u2202\u03c8 \u2217 \u2202\u03c8\n+ \u2207\u03c8 \u2217 * \u2207\u03c8 + m2 \u03c8 \u2217 \u03c8\n\u2202t \u2202t\n\n(2)\n\nis the Hamiltonian density. The second quantization of the field is performed by the multimode expansion of the fields\n\u03c8 and \u03c8 \u2217 and the subsequent replacement of the fields by the respective multimode field operators \u03c8\u0302 and \u03c8\u0302 \u2020 :\nX\n\u03c8\u0302 =\n(2V \u03b5k )\u22121/2 (\u00e2k e\u2212ikr + b\u0302\u2020k eikr ),\n(3)\nk\n\n\u03c8\u0302 \u2020 =\n\nX\n\n(2V \u03b5k )\u22121/2 (\u00e2\u2020k eikr + b\u0302k e\u2212ikr ),\n\n(4)\n\nk\n\nwhere \u03b5k = \u03c9k = (k2 + m2 )1/2 is the Planck-Einstein particle energy; \u00e2\u2020k , \u00e2k , b\u0302\u2020k , and b\u0302k are respectively the creation\nand destruction operators for the particles (bosons) and antiparticles (antibosons) inside the infinite volume V . The\noperators satisfy the canonical commutation relations [\u00e2kn , \u00e2\u2020km ] = [b\u0302kn , b\u0302\u2020km ] = \u03b4nm for the bosons and antibosons; the\nother operator pairs commute. Here, \u03b4nm is the Kronecker symbol. Equations (1)-(4) yielded the canonical quantum\nHamiltonian\nX\n\u02c6 + 1/2 + 1/2)\n\u0124 =\n\u03b5k (N\u0302k + N\u0304\n(5)\nk\nk\n\n\u02c6 = b\u0302\u2020 b\u0302 are the number operators for\ncorresponding the quantum field energy \u03b5 = h\u0124i, where N\u0302k = \u00e2\u2020k \u00e2k and N\u0304\nk\nk k\nthe particles and antiparticles, respectively. According to the traditional correspondence principle, the quantum and\nclassical treatments must be in agreement for a very large number of particles. The quantum field energy \u03b5 = h\u0124i\nis equal to the classical field energy \u03b5 = H for the very large number of particles: \u03b5 = h\u0124i = H if hN\u0302k i >> 1/2 and\n\u02c6 i >> 1/2.\nhN\u0304\nk\nThe above-presented, canonical model of boson fields may be summarized and interpreted as follows. In the model,\nunlike in canonical quantum mechanics, position is not an observable, and thus, one does not need the concept of a\nposition-space probability density. The resonator-like boundaries are located infinitely far from any spacetime point.\nThe wave-functions (resonator modes) \u03c8k (r) of the quantum mechanical system, in the non-operator or operator\nform, do not have a probabilistic interpretation in position space. The quantum mechanical system is considered as\nan infinite quantum field inside the infinite resonator. The field elementary degrees of freedom are the occupation\nnumbers, and each occupation number is indexed by a vector number k, indicating which of the single-particle states\nit refers to. The properties of this global field are explored by defining creation and annihilation quantum operators\nwith the canonical commutation relations imposed, which add and subtract particles. The field is considered as a set\nof degrees of freedom indexed by position, where the second quantization indexes the infinite field by enumerating the\nsingle-particle quantum states. Mathematically, the second quantization of the global (infinite) non-quantum field is\nperformed by replacing the field by the respective field operator. In other words, the real multimode field is replaced\nby the multimode field of operators. The classical (1) and quantum (5) Hamiltonians are invariant under the U (1)\nlocal gauge transformation (\u03c8k \u2192 \u03c8k\u2032 = ei\u03b1k \u03c8k ). The U (1) gauge symmetry of the classical Hamiltonian (1), which\nis provided by the orthogonality of wave-functions (the resonator modes are orthogonal to each other in the Hilbert\nspace), gives rise to the interference-less behavior of the wave-functions and the independence of the Hamiltonian on the\n\n\f7\nphases \u03b1k . Each boson or antiboson interferes (interacts) only with itself due to the canonical commutation relations\n[\u00e2kn , \u00e2\u2020km ] = [b\u0302kn , b\u0302\u2020km ] = \u03b4nm (the other operator pairs commute), which have been constructed to satisfy the U (1)\ngauge symmetry of the quantum Hamiltonian (5). Although the strict interference-less behaviour of the n-th and m-th\nparticles could be attributed to the commutation relations and/or the orthogonality of the wave-functions (the n-th and\nm-th resonator modes), the Hamiltonian symmetry also could be considered as a reason providing the interference-less\nbehaviour of the particles. In order to control the absence of both the interference between particles and the respective\ncross-correlation energy, the field Hamiltonians have been engineered by using the U (1) gauge symmetry. In other\nwords, the interference, cross-correlation and interaction between two different bosons or antibosons never occurs,\nin agreement with the Copenhagen-Dirac (canonical) interpretation of quantum interference, due to the U (1) gauge\nsymmetry of the mathematically constructed Hamiltonians. In accord with the canonical quantum interference, a\nparticle (wave-function, resonator mode) interferes only with itself. Thus, for instance, the boson and antiboson could\nnot annihilate each other due to the gauge symmetry. Both the boson and antiboson have the positive energy-mass\n\u03b5k = (k2 + m2 )1/2 , or more precisely, \u03b5k = (k2 + m2 )1/2 (1 + 1/2) [see, Eq. (5)]. Notice, the positive energy-mass\n\u03b5k = (k2 + m2 )1/2 of the antiboson is different from the negative energy-mass \u03b5k = \u2212(k2 + m2 )1/2 of the Dirac\nantiparticle. Although both the antiparticle with positive energy-mass and the antiparticle having negative energymass do satisfy the Einstein energy-mass relation \u03b52k = k2 + m2 , the only negative energy-mass of an antiparticle\nprovides physical annihilation of the positive energy-mass particle in the traditional quantum field models. Indeed,\nin the Dirac model of electrons and positrons, which is based on the Copenhagen-Dirac postulate, the antiparticle\n(positron) corresponds to the negative-energy solution of the Dirac equation. The physical interpretation of the\nnegative energy (mass) of antiparticles remains up to now one of the unsolved problems of traditional quantum field\ntheories.\nIn the above-presented model of the boson field theory, one should not confuse the wave (field) of operators with\nthe wave of probability associated with the wave-function of a boson in the canonical interpretation of quantum\nmechanics. The fields corresponding the field operators (3) and (4) are not attributed to the probability amplitude of\nthe wave of probability associated with the wave-function of the boson or antiboson. Unlike in quantum mechanics,\nthe generally accepted wave-function of a boson (antiboson) associated with the probability amplitude does not exist\nup to now. The properties of bosons in the boson field theory may be attributed rather to the properties of a\nwave of operators than the wave of probability of quantum mechanics. The Copenhagen (traditional) interpretation\n(philosophy) of the de Broglie wave associated with a boson (antiboson) as the wave of probability presents a more\nor less intuitively transparent background for the physical interpretation of quantum mechanics. Unfortunately, the\nphysical interpretation of the wave (field) of operators in the boson field theory has not been presented up to now.\nIndeed, in any physical interpretation, an operator should be considered rather as a pure mathematical object than a\nreal physical substance. It could be mentioned again in this regard that the canonical interpretation of the de Broglie\nwave using the pure mathematical object (probability) does not solve really the problem of physical interpretation of\nquantum mechanics. The wave of probability is also rather a pure mathematical object than a real physical matter.\nNotice, the dynamics of the above-considered infinite field of scalar bosons is determined by the Euler-Lagrange\nequation of motion in the Klein-Gordon-Fock form. Unlike in the traditional interpretation of the Klein-Gordon-Fock\ninfinite field of bosons by the quantum field theory, the Klein-Gordon-Fock equation was originally formulated and\ninterpreted by the authors as a single-particle equation analogous to the Schr\u00f6dinger equation. In the traditional\nquantum field theory, the resonator-like boundaries located infinitely far from any spacetime point of the infinite\nresonator do affect the global field and the field energy at this point instantaneously. Movement of the boundaries\nlocated infinitely far from a space point does change the resonator modes and modulate the field at this point with zero\ntime-delay, which is associated with infinite velocity of the signal propagation. The infinite velocities of the signals\nin the resonator, which has never been interpreted physically, is incompatible with the Einstein theory of special\nrelativity. Also note that the numbers of particles 1 and 1/2 in the expression \u03b5k = (k2 + m2 )1/2 (1 + 1/2) [Eq. (5)]\ncould be associated respectively with the whole particle (boson or anti-boson) and the half of the particle. Although\nthe half-particles have never been observed experimentally, the energy \u03b5k = (k2 + m2 )1/2 (1/2) of such half-particles\nin the quantum field theory is usually interpreted as the vacuum energy.\n2.1.2. Boson scalar non-quantum and quantum fields with the cross-correlation\n\nLet me now suggest the existence of an arbitrary number N of the finite boson scalar fields \u03c8n (r, t). These\nspatially and temporally finite fields (beams), unlike in the quantum mechanics and particle field theory based on\nthe traditional interpretation of quantum interference, could interfere with each other. The model should include\nnot only the increase or decrease of the local density of the energy and number of particles by the interference\n\n\f8\n(cross-correlation) of the interfering (interacting) fields, but at the pure additive or subtractive interference should\ntake into P\naccount the creation or destruction of the energy and number of particles. The dynamics of the field\nN\n\u03c8(r, t) = n=1 \u03c8n (r, t) of the interfering fields \u03c8n (r, t) is determined by the Euler-Lagrange equation of motion with\nthe initial and boundary conditions imposed. The second quantization of these \"non-quantum\" fields, the replacement\nof the fields by the fields of operators, will be presented in the next subsection. For the sake of simplicity, the formulas\nin the present study are presented for the discrete number of fields. One can easily rewrite the formulas for the\ncontinuous spectra by integrating the\nP number density. The generalization of the canonical non-quantum Hamiltonian\n(1) for the superposition \u03c8(r, t) = N\nn=1 \u03c8n (r, t) of the interfering fields \u03c8n (r, t) yields\nH=\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\n3\n\nhd x =\n\n0\n\nN\nX\n\nn=1\n\nHnn +\n\n2\nNX\n\u2212N\n\nn6=m\n\nHnm ,\n\n(6)\n\nwhere\nHnm =\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\nhnm d3 x,\n\n(7)\n\n0\n\nand\nhnm =\n\n\u2202\u03c8n\u2217 \u2202\u03c8m\n+ \u2207\u03c8n\u2217 * \u2207\u03c8m + mn \u03c8n\u2217 mm \u03c8m .\n\u2202t \u2202t\n\n(8)\n\nIt could be mentioned that such a generalization, in fact, is the direct generalization of the Einstein famous energymass relation \u03b52 = k2 + m2 for the particles (bodies), which interfere with each other. For more details see Part II\nof the present study. Notice, the Hamiltonian density h is not invariant under the U (1) local gauge transformation\n(\u03c8n \u2192 \u03c8n\u2032 = ei\u03b1n \u03c8n ) given rise to the interference between the non-quantum finite fields \u03c8n (r, t) \u2261 \u03c6n (r, t)ei\u03b1n and\n\u03c8m (r, t) \u2261 \u03c6m (r, t)ei\u03b1m and the dependence of the Hamiltonian on the phases \u03b1n and \u03b1m . In the present model of\nunified fields and interactions, the classical and quantum treatments must be in agreement not only for a very large\nnumber of particles. This general correspondence principle could be considered as a generalization of the traditional\ncorrespondence principle of quantum physics. In contrast to the canonical model considered in Sec. 2.1.1. and in\nagreement with the general correspondence principle, the field energy in the present model is determined by the\nrelation \u03b5 = h\u0124i = H for the classical and quantum fields with an arbitrary number of particles. The term Hnn is\nassociated with the canonical energy of the single field \u03c8n (r, t). In the terms of the present model, the Hamiltonian\nHnn describes the correlation (interference) of the finite field \u03c8n (r, t) with itself. In the limit of the infinite field\n\u03c8n (r, t), the self-correlation energy Hnn could be interpreted as the Hamiltonian (self-energy) of the single mode of\nthe global (infinite) field, which is used in particle field theory before the second quantization of this (non-quantum)\nfield. The cross-correlation energy Hnm , which does not exist in quantum mechanics and particle field theory [12\u201319],\nis attributed to the interference (cross-correlation) of the finite fields \u03c8n (r, t) with \u03c8m (r, t). It will be shown later\n[see, Sec. (6)] that the cross-correlation energy Hnm in the limit of the infinite fields \u03c8n (r, t) and \u03c8m (r, t) can be\ninterpreted (remember that the cross-correlation energy associated with the ordinary interference does not exist in\nquantum mechanics and particle field theory) as the energy of interaction of the resonator modes of the infinite (global)\nfield in particle field theory. The Hamiltonian (6) describes the interference of the boson fields, \u03c8n (r, t) \u2261 \u03c8nb (r, t).\nIf the field \u03c8n (r, t) is composed from the boson field \u03c8nb (r, t) and the antiboson field \u03c8nab (r, t), then the Hamiltonian\nis described by Eqs. (6)-(8), where \u03c8n (r, t) = \u03c8nb (r, t) + \u03c8nab (r, t) and \u03c8n\u2217 (r, t) = \u03c8n\u2217b (r, t) + \u03c8n\u2217ab (r, t). In the case\nof \u03c8nb (r, t) = \u2212\u03c8nab (r, t) and \u03c8n\u2217b (r, t) = \u2212\u03c8n\u2217ab (r, t), the superposition of the fields results into their annihilation. It\nshould be noted that the energy conservation of the total physical system under the annihilation is provided rather\nby the exchange of the energy with the environment (boundaries or other fields) than by the shift symmetry of time.\nWe now consider the Hamiltonian (6) of the interfering fields \u03c8n (r, t) and \u03c8m (r, t) in more details. At the time\nmoment t the finite fields \u03c8n (r, t) and \u03c8m (r, t) occupy respectively the finite volumes Vn and Vm . The cross-correlation\nenergy Hnm vanishes, Hnm = Hnm \u03b4nm , if the fields \u03c8n (r, t) and \u03c8m (r, t) do not overlap (interfere) with each other.\nHere, \u03b4nm is the Kronecker delta. Notice, the infinite fields occupying the infinite volume are overlapped in the whole\nspace. In such a case, the field energy always includes both the canonical energies Hnn of the single fields \u03c8n (r, t)\nand the cross-correlation energies Hnm associated with the ordinary interference (cross-correlation) between the fields\n\u03c8n (r, t) and \u03c8m (r, t). In contrast to the infinite fields, the ordinary interference of the finite fields (beams) requires\nthe creation of the interference conditions. In order to interfere, the finite fields \u03c8n (r, t) and \u03c8m (r, t) or their parts\nhave to occupy (share) the same volume Vnm = Vn = Vm at the same time moment tnm = tn = tm . The total energy\nH at the moment tnm is calculated by integrating the Hamiltonian density h in the infinite volume. The Hamiltonian\n\n\f9\ncontains the canonical energy of the single fields \u03c8n (r, t) occupying the volumes Vn and the cross-correlation energy\nof the fields overlapped in the volume Vnm at the time tnm :\nH=\n\nN Z\nX\n\n3\n\nhnn d x +\n\nVn\n\nn=1\n\n2\nNX\n\u2212N\n\nn6=m\n\nZ\n\nhnm d3 x.\n\n(9)\n\nVnm\n\nAccording to Eq. (9), the canonical self-energies Hnn of the fields \u03c8n (r, t) are permanent (constant) in the time,\nwhile the cross-correlation energy Hnm depends on the time moment of the overlapping (interference) of the finite\nPN\nPN 2 \u2212N\nPN\nfields \u03c8n (r, t) with \u03c8m (r, t): H(t) = n=1 Hnn + n6=m Hnm (t). The difference \u2206H(t) = H(t) \u2212 n=1 Hnn =\nPN 2 \u2212N\nPN\nn6=m Hnm (t) between the generalized energy (6) and the canonical energy\nn=1 Hnn logically to call the crosscorrelation energy or the defect of energy-mass. Notice, the boundaries located infinitely far from the finite field,\nunlike in the case of an infinite field of particles in quantum field theory, do not affect the field and energy. In other\nwords, movement of the boundaries located infinitely far in the transverse or longitudinal direction from the finite\nfield (beam) could not modulate this field. One should not confuse vanishing the cross-correlation energy Hnm by\nnon-overlapping the finite\nfields \u03c8n (r, t) and \u03c8m (r, t) with the case of the \"orthonormal\" fields, which satisfy the\nR\nwell-known condition Vnm \u03c8n\u2217 (r)\u03c8m (r)d3 x = \u03b4nm of the orthonormality in the Hilbert space. The orthonormal fields\ndo overlap, but the cross-correlation integrals (7) are equal to zero due to the orthonormality, Hnm = Hnm \u03b4nm .\nAmong the orthonormal fields that satisfy the Euler-Lagrange equation of motion with the initial and boundary\nconditions imposed one could mention the transverse and longitudinal (stationary or transient [24](d)) modes, the\nFourier decomposition terms (time harmonic plane-waves with different spatial and/or temporal frequencies), and\nother eigensolutions.\nThe above-considered boson fields can exist in the form of the waves, as well as the static (time-independent) fields.\nLet me first consider the wave-like fields. The configuration and dynamics of the wave-like field are determined by\nthe Euler-Lagrange equation of motion with the initial and boundary conditions imposed. The simplest solution of\nthe equation for the finite wave \u03c8n (r, t), which is located infinitely far from the boundaries, is the time-harmonic\n(stationary) wave\n\u03c8n (r, t) = an e\u2212i\u03b5n t ei(kn r\u2212\u03b1n ) .\n\n(10)\n\nNotice, \u03b5n = \u03c9n in the natural units. Other solutions of the Euler-Lagrange equation are considered in Part II of the\npresent study. In the initial time moment t = tn = 0, the field \u03c8n (r, t) occupies the finite volume Vn . The spatial\ndistribution of the field in this volume is given by\n\u03c8n (r) = an ei(kn r\u2212\u03b1n ) ,\n\n(11)\n\nPN\nPN 2 \u2212N\nwhere \u03b1n is the wave phase. At the time moment t = tnm 6= 0, the Hamiltonian H = n=1 Hnn + n6=m Hnm (t)\nPN\nof the superposition \u03c8(r, t) = n=1 \u03c8n (r, t) of the cross-correlating fields \u03c8n (r, t) is given by Eq. (9):\nH=\n\nN Z\nX\n\nn=1\n\nVn\n\n[\u03b52n\n\n+\n\nk2n\n\n+\n\nm2n ]a2n d3 x\n\n+\n\n2\nNX\n\u2212N\n\nn6=m\n\nZ\n\n[\u03b5n \u03b5m + kn km + mn mm ]an am e\u2212i(\u2206knm r\u2212\u2206\u03b5nm t\u2212\u2206\u03b1nm ) d3 x,\n\n(12)\n\nVnm\n\nwhere \u2206knm = kn \u2212 km , \u2206\u03b5nm = \u03b5n \u2212 \u03b5m and \u2206\u03b1nm = \u03b1n \u2212 \u03b1m . The first term of the right-hand side of Eq.\n(12) does not take into account the cross-correlation phenomenon associated with the ordinary interference of the\nP\nfields \u03c8n (r, t). The term is associated with the field superposition \u03c8(r, t) = N\nn=1 \u03c8n (r, t), where each field \u03c8n (r, t)\ncorrelates (interferes) only with itself. The total energy of the N correlation-free fields \u03c8n (r, t) is permanent [H 6= H(t)]\nand its value does not depend on the interference conditions:\nH=\n\nN\nX\n\nn=1\n\nHnn =\n\nN\nX\n\n[\u03b52n + k2n + m2n ]a2n Vn .\n\n(13)\n\nn=1\n\nThe Hamiltonian\nHnn = [\u03b52n + k2n + m2n ]a2n Vn\n\n(14)\n\ncorresponds to the canonical Hamiltonian of the single field (interference-less resonator mode) \u03c8kn (r, t) in the traditional particle field theory (Sec. 2.1.1.). The second term of the right-hand side of Eq. (12) plays a key role in\n\n\f10\ndescription of the increase or decrease of the local density of the field energy under the interference. The positive\nPN 2 \u2212N\nor negative cross-correlation energy n6=m Hnm (t) is responsible for the energy associated with the interference\n(cross-correlation) between the waves \u03c8kn (r, t) and \u03c8km (r, t) that can change the total energy of the interfering fields.\nIf the waves interfere only destructively in the common volume Vnm , then the interference of waves completely destroys the wave energy. The interference increases the wave energy if the waves interfere only constructively. The\nenergy of interfering waves can be increased or completely destroyed in an ensemble of the coherent waves by the\nappropriate modification of the wave phases \u03b1n . The pure additive or subtractive interference is provided by the\n\"additional\" energy, which should be added or subtracted from the total physical system before the interference. In\nsuch a case, the physical system does not obey the shift symmetry of time. Therefore, the energy nonconservation\nassociated with the cross-correlation energy does not contradict the Noether theorem. The energy conservation of the\ntotal physical system is provided rather by the exchange of the energy with the environment (material boundaries or\nexternal fields) than by the shift symmetry of time. The physical mechanism behind the cross-correlation energy in\nthe above-considered non-quantum boson fields is simply the phenomenon of classical (ordinary) interference.\nLet me now suggest existence of a basic unit of the boson field, an indivisible unit-field \u03c80 (r, t) of the matter (massPN\nenergy), which could be associated with a boson (particle). The Hamiltonian of the field \u03c8n (r, t) = n=1 \u03c80n (r, t),\nwhich is the superposition of indivisible unit-fields \u03c80n (r, t), is given by Eqs. (6) and (7) with the Hamiltonian cross\u2202\u03c8 \u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n* \u2207\u03c80m + mn \u03c80n\nmm \u03c80m . The concrete parameters (shape, spatial and\ncorrelation density hnm = \u2202t0n \u2202\u03c8\u2202t0m + \u2207\u03c80n\ntemporal distributions and phase) of the indivisible unit-field \u03c80n (r, t), which depend on the experimental conditions,\nare determined by the Euler-Lagrange equation of motion with\nR \u221ethe initial and boundary conditions imposed. According\nto the general correspondence principle, the energy H11 = 0 h11 d3 x of a boson unit-field \u03c80 (r, t) should be equal to\nthe Planck-Einstein particle energy \u03b50 = \u03c90 = (k20 + m20 )1/2 independently from the concrete form of this unit-field:\nR \u221e \u2202\u03c8\u2217 0\n\u2217\n\u2217\n3\n2\n2 1/2\nH11 = 0 [ \u2202t0 \u2202\u03c8\n. In the case of a free boson describing by the time\u2202t + \u2207\u03c80 * \u2207\u03c80 + m0 \u03c80 m0 \u03c80 ]d x = (k0 + m0 )\nharmonic unit-field (unit-wave) located infinitely far from the boundaries [see, Eqs. (10) and (14)], the correspondence\nprinciple yields the boson energy\nH11 = [\u03b520 + k20 + m20 ]a20 V0 = [k20 + m20 ]1/2 ,\n\n(15)\n\nwhich may be called the self-correlation energy, self-interference energy or simply self-energy. Then the boson unitwave (de Broglie's wave) of the mass-energy associated with the particle is given by\n\u03c80 (r, t) = a0 e\u2212i\u03b50 t ei(k0 r\u2212\u03b1) ,\n\n(16)\n\nwhere the amplitude a0 = (2V0 [k20 + m20 ]1/2 )\u22121/2 = (2V0 \u03b50 )\u22121/2 [see, Eqs. (3) and (4) for comparison of the field\namplitudes]. Remember, \u03b50 = \u03c90 in the natural units. It could be noted that other solutions of the Euler-Lagrange\nequation determining the unit-field configuration \u03c80 (r, t) are considered in Part II of the present study. In the case\nPN\nof the superposition \u03c8(r, t) = n=1 \u03c80n (r, t) of the correlation-free unit-waves \u03c80n (r, t) = a0 ei\u03b50 t e\u2212i(k0n r\u2212\u03b1n ) , the\nP\nHamiltonian H = N\nn=1 Hnn is given by Eq. (13):\nH = N \u03b50 ,\n\n(17)\n\nwhere H 6= H(t). The number of the interference-free unit-waves, which is a positive integer, is then given by\nN = \u03b50 \u22121 H,\n\n(18)\n\nwhere N 6= N (t). For the N cross-correlating unit-waves \u03c80n (r, t) describing by the Hamiltonian H = H(t) =\nPN 2 \u2212N\nPN\nn6=m Hnm (t), Eq. (12) yields\nn=1 Hnn +\nH=\n\nN\nX\n\nn=1\n\n\u03b50n +\n\n2\nNX\n\u2212N\n\nn6=m\n\nZ\n\n[\u03b50n \u03b50m + k0n k0m + m0n m0m ]a0n a0m e\u2212i(\u2206k0nm r\u2212\u2206\u03b50nm t\u2212\u2206\u03b1nm ) d3 x.\n\n(19)\n\nVnm\n\nThe expression (19) could be considered as the direct generalization of the Planck-Einstein energy \u03b50 = \u03c90 = (k20 +\nm20 )1/2 for the N interfering particles (bodies). The generalized energy of the body composed from the N interfering\nPN 2 \u2212N R\nbodies (particles) is given by the energy H 6= N (k20 + m20 )1/2 . The difference \u2206H(t) =\nn>m\nVnm [\u03b50n \u03b50m +\nk0n k0m + m0n m0m ]a0n a0m 2cos(\u2206k0nm r \u2212 \u2206\u03b50nm t \u2212 \u2206\u03b1nm )d3 x between the generalized energy (19) and the PlanckPN\nEinstein self-correlation energy n=1 \u03b50n is the cross-correlation energy (defect of energy-mass) of the interfering\n\n\f11\nparticles (unit-fields). Notice, the energy-mass defect (cross-correlation energy-mass), which depends on the unit-field\nphases \u03b1n and \u03b1m , can be positive or negative. The sign depends on the interference conditions determining by the\nvalues \u2206k0nm r \u2212 \u2206\u03b50nm t \u2212 \u2206\u03b1nm . In the case of a single particle (N = 1), the generalized energy (19) is equal\nto the Planck-Einstein energy H = \u03b50 of the particle. The energy (19) of a body composed from the N incoherent\nunit-waves (particles) has the conventional value H = N \u03b50 . In other words, the conventional (Planck-Einstein) energymass is the pure incoherent energy-mass, while the generalized energy (19) includes the additional energy, namely\nthe coherent cross-correlation energy-mass (energy-mass defect). That is a difference between the conventional and\ngeneralized energy-masses. It should be stressed that the physical mechanism behind the cross-correlation energy-mass\nin Eq. (19) is the interference between particles (unit-fields). In the case of V0n = V0m = V0 , m0n = m0m = m0 ,\nk0n = k0m = k0 and \u03b50n = \u03b50m = \u03b50 , Eq. (19) is given by\nH = N \u03b50 ,\n\n(20)\n\nwhere\nN =N+\n\n2\nNX\n\u2212N\n\nei\u2206\u03b1mn\n\n(21)\n\nn6=m\n\nis the effective number N of the interfering unit-waves (particles), which depends on the interference conditions\ndetermining by the phases differences \u2206\u03b1mn ; the effective number N can be a non-integer, for instance, fractional\nPN 2 \u2212N\nnumber bigger or smaller than one. The respective defect energy (mass) is given by \u2206H = \u03b50 n6=m ei\u2206\u03b1mn . One\ncan easily demonstrate that the energy of the cross-correlating unit-waves\n0 \u2264 H \u2264 N 2 \u03b50 ,\n\n(22)\n\nand the respective effective number of the unit-waves\n0 \u2264 N \u2264 N 2.\n\n(23)\n\nFor instance, Eqs. (20) and (21) yielded the energy H = N 2 \u03b50 and the effective number N = N 2 for the pure additive\ninterference (\u2206\u03b1nm = 0). The pure subtractive interference results into annihilation of the unit-waves and energy.\nThe annihilation takes place if the pairs of unit-waves satisfy the phase condition \u03b1n \u2212 \u03b1m = \u00b1\u03c0. The annihilation\nab\nb\n(r, t) = 0 of the pairs of unit-waves can be represented as the pure subtractive interference of the boson\n(r, t) + \u03c80n\n\u03c80n\nunit-fields\nb\n\u03c80n\n(r, t) = a0 e\u2212i\u03b50 t ei(k0 r\u2212\u03b1n )\n\n(24)\n\nab\n\u03c80n\n(r, t) = a0 e\u2212i\u03b50 t ei(k0 r\u2212\u03b1n ) e\u00b1i\u03c0 .\n\n(25)\n\nwith the antiboson unit-fields\n\nIn the case of Nb = Nab , the pure subtractive interference of the boson field\n\u03c8 b (r, t) =\n\nNb\nX\n\nb\n\u03c80n\n(r, t)\n\n(26)\n\nab\n\u03c80n\n(r, t),\n\n(27)\n\nn=1\n\nwith the antiboson field\n\u03c8 ab (r, t) =\n\nNab\nX\n\nn=1\n\nresults into annihilation of the fields and energy. It should be stressed again that the energy conservation of the total\nphysical system under the annihilation is provided rather by the exchange of the energy with the environment (for\ninstance, boundaries or other fields) than by the shift symmetry of time. The unit-waves do annihilate only partially\nif \u03b1n \u2212 \u03b1m = \u00b1\u03c0 \u00b1 \u03b4, where |\u03b4| < \u03c0. In order to provide the annihilation of a boson unit-wave with an antiboson\nunit-wave for the arbitrary wave-number (momentum) vectors and phases, the waves should satisfy the annihilation\ncondition\n\u03c80b (r, t; kb0 , \u03b1b ) + \u03c80ab (r, t; kab\n0 , \u03b1ab ) = 0\n\n(28)\n\n\f12\nindependently from the values of the wave momentum (wave-number) vectors and phases. In such a case, the antiboson\nunit-field is the true antiparticle unit-field, which cannot be obtained by the phase shift of the boson field. In the case\nof kb0 = kab\n0 = 0 and \u03b1b = \u03b1ab = 0, however, the massive (m0 6= 0) fields only satisfy the condition (28). Therefore, the\nmass-less fields do not have the true antiparticle unit-fields (antiparticles). According to Eqs. (6) and (28), the energy\nb\u2212b\nab\u2212ab\nb\u2212ab\nab\u2212b\nH = 0 of the annihilated boson-antiboson pair can be presented as the sum H11\n+H22\n+(\u2212H12\n)+(\u2212H21\n) = 0 of\nb\u2212b\nab\u2212ab\n,\nthe positive boson-boson self-correlation energy H11 , the positive antiboson-antiboson self-correlation energy H22\nb\u2212ab\nthe negative boson-antiboson cross-correlation energy (\u2212H12 ) and the negative antiboson-boson cross-correlation\nab\u2212b\nenergy (\u2212H21\n). That means the energies of both the boson and antiboson unit-fields (bosons and antibosons)\nare always positive. The negative signs of the boson-antiboson and antiboson-boson cross-correlation energies do\nreflect just a fact of the destructive interference (cross-correlation) of the boson and antiboson unit-waves. Notice,\nthe positive sign of the energy-mass \u03b50 = (k20 + m20 )1/2 of the antiboson is different from the negative sign of the\nenergy-mass \u03b50 = \u2212(k20 + m20 )1/2 of the Dirac antiparticle satisfying the Einstein condition \u03b520 = [\u2212(k20 + m20 )1/2 ]2 .\nThe above-described model can be applied for other physical parameters of the cross-correlating unit-waves (fields)\nPN\n\u03c80n (r, t). For instance, the momentum P of the field \u03c8(r, t) = n=1 \u03c80n (r, t) is given by\nP = P i ei ,\n\n(29)\n\nwhere\ni\n\nP =\n\nN\nX\n\nn=1\n\ni\nPnn\n\n+\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\ni\nPnm\n=\n\n0\n\n2\nNX\n\u2212N\n\nn6=m\n\ni\nPnm\n,\n\npinm d3 x,\n\n(30)\n\n(31)\n\nand\npinm = \u2212\n\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2202\u03c80m\n\u2202\u03c80n \u2202\u03c80m\n\u2202\u03c80n\n\u2212\n.\n\u2202t \u2202xi\n\u2202t \u2202xi\n\n(32)\n\nHere, pinm is the momentum density, which takes into account the cross-correlation of the unit-fields \u03c80n (r, t). The\nequation (30) yields\ni\n\nP =\n\nN\nX\n\nn=1\n\ni\nk0n\n\n+\n\n2\nNX\n\u2212N\n\nn6=m\n\nZ\n\nVnm\n\ni\ni\n[\u03b50n k0m\n+ \u03b50m k0n\n]a0n a0m e\u2212i(\u2206k0nm r\u2212\u2206\u03b50nm t\u2212\u2206\u03b1nm ) d3 x,\n\n(33)\n\nwhere a0n = (2V0n \u03b50n )\u22121/2 and a0m = (2V0m \u03b50m )\u22121/2 . If the values V0n = V0m = V0 , m0n = m0m = m0 and\nk0n = k0m = k0 (respectively, \u03b50n = \u03b50m = \u03b50 ), then Eq. (29) is given by\nP = N k0 ,\n\n(34)\n\nwhere N is the effective number (21) of the unit-waves. Notice, the angular momentum L of the interfering unit-fields\ncan be found by\nPthe similar generalization of the angular momentum L = r \u00d7 P or the relativistic angular momentum\ntensor Lnm = (xn pm \u2212 xm pn ). The generalized rest mass M (0 \u2264 M \u2264 N 2 m0 ) of the system, which is determined\nby Eq. (20) with k0 \u2192 0, is given by\nM = N m0 ,\n\n(35)\n\nwhere m0 = \u03b50 . Indeed, for \u03b50 = (k20 + m20 )1/2 and k0 \u2192 0, the energy \u03b50 \u2192 m0 . The expression (35) could be\nconsidered as a generalization of the Einstein energy-mass relation \u03b5 = mc2 (\u03b5 = m in the natural units) for the N\ninterfering particles (bodies). The generalized rest mass of the body composed from the N interfering bodies (particles)\nis given by the mass M 6= N m0 . The difference \u2206M = (N \u2212 N )m0 between the generalized rest mass (35) and the\nconventional (Newton-Einstein) rest mass N m0 logically to call the cross-correlation rest mass or the rest-mass defect.\nIn the case of a single particle (N = 1), the generalized rest mass (35) is equal to the Newton-Einstein rest mass M =\nm0 of the particle. The generalized rest mass (35) of a body composed from the N incoherent unit-waves (particles)\nhas the conventional value M = N m0 . It should be stressed, in this regard, that the cross-correlation (coherent)\nmass does not exist in the Newton and Einstein mechanics. In astrophysics and cosmology, the invisible mass is\n\n\f13\nusually called the \"dark\" mass. In order to account for the well-known discrepancies between measurements based\non the mass of the visible matter in astronomy and cosmology and definitions of the mass made through dynamical\nor general relativistic means, the present model does not need in hypothesizing the existence of \"dark\" mass. In the\npresent model, the \"dark\" cosmological mass as well as the well-known spiral cosmological structures are associated\nwith the cross-correlation (coherent) energy-mass of the moving cosmological objects. Note that the generalized mass\nM = 0 of an annihilated boson-antiboson pair can be presented as the sum of the positive boson-boson self-correlation\nab\u2212ab\nb\nmass Mb\u2212b\n= mab\n0 = m0 , the negative\n11 = m0 = m0 , the positive antiboson-antiboson self-correlation mass M22\nb\u2212ab\nb 1/2\nab 1/2\nboson-antiboson cross-correlation mass (\u2212M12 ) = \u2212(m0 ) (m0 )\n= \u2212m0 and the negative antiboson-boson\nab 1/2\ncross-correlation mass (\u2212Mab\u2212b\n(mb0 )1/2 = \u2212m0 :\n21 ) = \u2212(m0 )\nab\u2212ab\nab\u2212b\nM = Mb\u2212b\n+ (\u2212Mb\u2212ab\n11 + M22\n12 ) + (\u2212M21 ) = 0.\n\n(36)\n\nThat means the masses of both the boson and antiboson unit-fields (bosons and antibosons) are always positive.\nThe negative signs of the boson-antiboson and antiboson-boson cross-correlation masses do reflect just a fact of the\ndestructive interference (cross-correlation) of the boson and antiboson unit-waves [see, the comments to Eq. (28)]. It\nshould be stressed again that the positive sign of the rest mass (energy \u03b50 = m0 ) of the antibosons in the present\nmodel is different from the negative sign of the rest mass (energy \u03b50 = \u2212(m20 )1/2 ) of the Dirac antiparticle. If the\nunit-charge q0 is associated with the mass m0 of the unit-wave \u03c80n (r, t) [see comments to Eq. (123), Eq. (124) and\nFigs. (5)-(8)], then the effective charge Q of the cross-correlating unit-fields is given by\nQ = N q0 ,\n\n(37)\n\nwhere 0 \u2264 Q \u2264 N 2 q0 . Similarly, if the magnetic moment ~\u03bc0 is associated with the mass m0 of the unit-wave \u03c80n (r),\n~ of the cross-correlating unit-fields is given by\nthen the effective magnetic moment M\n~ = N ~\u03bc0\nM\n\n(38)\n\n~ \u2264 N 2m\nwith 0 \u2264 M\n~ 0 . In the case of the pure subtractive interference of the boson field (26) with the antiboson field\n(27), the effective charge is given by the sum of the positive charge of the boson field with the negative charge of the\nantiboson field:\nQ = Nb q0 + Nab (\u2212q0 ).\n\n(39)\n\nAlthough the charge and the charge-associated parameters of the particle (boson or antiboson) have been formally\nintroduced [see, Eqs. (37)-(39)] into the scalar boson model, the existence or nonexistence of the boson and antiboson charges is determined rather by the empirical data than the model. In other words, the introduction or\nnon-introduction of the charges into the model should correspond to the experimental observations of the nature of\nconcrete field.\nThe basic properties of the interfering particles (unit-waves) of the above-presented model can be summarized\nas follows. The unit-fields of the present model are not the point particles and waves (particle-wave dualism) of\nquantum mechanics or the point particles of quantum field theory. The unit-fields have simultaneously the properties\nof the point particles and waves of quantum mechanics, the point particles of quantum field theory, as well as the\nproperties of the 3-dimensional (in space) waves of theory of classical fields. The Hamiltonian of the superposition of\nindivisible material unit-waves \u03c80n (r, t) is given by Eqs. (6) and (7), with the Hamiltonian cross-correlation density\n\u2202\u03c8 \u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n* \u2207\u03c80m + mn \u03c80n\nmm \u03c80m . The exact form of the indivisible unit-field \u03c80n (r, t), which\nhnm = \u2202t0n \u2202\u03c8\u2202t0m + \u2207\u03c80n\ndepends on the experimental conditions, is determined by the Euler-Lagrange equation of motion with the initial\nand boundary conditions imposed. In the case of the boson fields composed from the time-harmonic finite unit-fields\nlocated infinitely far from the boundaries, the above-derived number of unit-waves, magnetic moment, mass and\ncharge of the waves are equal to the respective values of the traditional particle field theory if the unit-fields are free\nfrom the cross-correlation associated with the ordinary interference phenomenon. However, the calculated energy\n\u03b50 = \u03c90 = (k20 + m20 )1/2 and momentum p0 = k0 of the unit-wave (particle), which are equal to the Planck-Einstein\nenergy and momentum of the particle, are different from the canonical values \u03b50 = \u03c90 + (1/2)\u03c90 and p0 = k0 + (1/2)k0\nof traditional particle field theory. The positive energy-mass \u03b50 = (k20 + m20 )1/2 of antibosons in the present model\nis different from the negative energy-mass \u03b50 = \u2212(k20 + m20 )1/2 of the Dirac antiparticles satisfying the energy-mass\nrelation \u03b520 = [\u2212(k20 + m20 )1/2 ]2 . The energy and momentum of the empty vacuum, in agreement with the Einstein\nand classical physics energies of the empty space, are equal to zero. In the present model, the dynamics of the finite\nfields is determined by the Euler-Lagrange equation of motion with the initial and boundary conditions imposed. The\n\n\f14\nphysical parameters of the cross-correlating fields have been derived for the relativistic fields with the unit-field energy\n\u03b50 = (k20 + m20 )1/2 . One can easily demonstrate that the physical parameters of the non-relativistic (k0 \u2192 0) fields\nare described by Eqs. (6)-(39), where the unit-field energy is given by \u03b50 \u2248 (k20 /2m0 ) + m0 . The absolute minimum\nof energy of the unit-field in both the relativistic and non-relativistic cases is given by \u03b5min\n= m0 . Notice, the\n0\naforementioned transition from the relativistic cross-correlating boson unit-fields to non-relativistic ones is somewhat\nsimilar to the transition from the relativistic correlation-free spinor (electron) infinite field describing by the Dirac\nequation of motion with the resonator-like boundary conditions to the non-relativistic correlation-free finite waves of\nprobabilities (finite wave-functions), whose dynamics is determined by the Schr\u00f6dinger equation with the quantum\nmechanical boundary conditions imposed. In this regard, one could mention that the Klein-Gordon-Fock equation\ndescribing dynamics of the infinite boson field was originally formulated and interpreted by the authors as a singleparticle equation similar to the Schr\u00f6dinger equation. It should be stressed again that the physical system of the\ninterfering boson-fields contains not only the interfering fields, but also the boundaries that may provide the pure\nconstructive or destructive interference. The energy of interfering fields is changed under the pure constructive or\ndestructive interference, however, the total energy of the physical system is conserved. The external energy, which\nis added or subtracted from the interfering fields before the interference, insures the pure additive or subtractive\ninterference. Thus the physical system of interfering fields does not exhibit the shift symmetry of time. The energy\nconservation of the physical system is provided rather by the irreversible exchange of the energy with the environment\n(boundaries or other fields) than by the shift symmetry of time. Therefore, the energy nonconservation associated\nwith the cross-correlation energy is in agreement witht the Noether theorem. In contrast to the pure constructive or\ndestructive interference, the creation of conditions of the normal (not pure constructive or destructive) interference\nof the boson fields does not require the additional energy from the environment. Indeed, the energy conservation of\nthe total physical system under the normal interference of the boson fields is provided by the shift symmetry of time\nin such a system.\nThe above-described model of the boson unit-fields suggests the simple interpretations and explanations of the\nquantum phenomena associated with the bosons. Indeed, the Copenhagen interpretation (philosophy) of the de Broglie\nwave using the pure mathematical object (probability) does not solve really the problem of physical interpretation\nof the quantum mechanics of bosons. In any physical interpretation, the wave of probability associated with the\nboson would be rather a pure mathematical object than a real material substance. In the boson field theory, up to\nnow, it is not completely clear how to interpret physically the wave (field) of boson operators. The boson operator\nis also rather a pure mathematical object than a real physical matter. The real finite-wave or real finite unit-wave\nof the boson matter (mass-energy) described in Sec. 2.1.2 is not the wave of probability of quantum mechanics or\nthe wave of operators of the canonical particle field theory. The division of the \"non-quantum\" field \u03c8 of the boson\nmatter (mass-energy) into the indivisible \"non-quantum\" unit-fields \u03c80n of the boson matter (mass-energy) [see, Eqs.\n(15)-(39)], in fact, is the second quantization of the real, material boson field without the use of the non-material fields\nof operators or probabilities. The second quantization performed by replacing the \"non-quantum\" unit-fields of the\nboson matter (mass-energy) by the non-material unit-fields of boson operators is presented in the next section.\nFinally, it should be noted that the unified description of the interfering elementary particles (unit-fields) is given\nin Part II of the present study, where the Hamiltonian H11 of the massive (the rest mass m0 6= 0) particle is\nassociated with the unit-field energy squared (H11 = \u03b520 = k20 + m20 ). Respectively, the Hamiltonian H of the\nmassive field composed from the N particles (unit-fields) is attributed to the total field-energy squared (H = \u03b52 =\nPN\nPN 2 \u2212N\nn=1 Hnn +\nn6=m Hnm ). In such a case, the physical parameters of the interfering massive unit-fields are described\nby the above-presented equations with 0 \u2264 \u03b5 \u2264 N \u03b50 and 0 \u2264 N \u2264 N . In Part I of the present study, the Hamiltonian\nH11 of the particle is associated with the unit-field energy H11 = \u03b50 = [k20 + m20 ]1/2 , and the Hamiltonian H of\nthe field composed from the N particles having the non-zero rest mass is attributed to the total-energy H = \u03b5 =\nPN\nPN 2 \u2212N\n2\nn=1 Hnn +\nn6=m Hnm . The energy of the cross-correlating massive unit-fields is then given by 0 \u2264 H \u2264 N \u03b50\n2\nwith the respective effective number 0 \u2264 N \u2264 N of the unit-fields.\n2.1.3. Boson scalar quantum-fields of operators with the cross-correlation\n\nAccording to the traditional field theory [4, 12\u201319], the second quantization of the non-quantum fields \u03c8 and \u03c8 \u2217 ,\nwhich are free from the interference, cross-correlation and cross-correlation energy, is performed by replacing the fields\nby the respective field operators \u03c8\u0302 and \u03c8\u0302 \u2020 [see, Sec. (2.1.1.)]. I would apply this approach to the cross-correlating\n\"non-quantum\" fields described in the previous section. The operator \u03c8\u03020 of the unit-field\n\u03c80 (r, t) = a0 e\u2212i\u03b50 t ei(k0 r\u2212\u03b1)\n\n(40)\n\n\f15\nis given by\n\u03c8\u03020 = \u00e2a0 ei(k0 r\u2212i\u03b1) ,\n\n(41)\n\n\u03c80\u2217 (r, t) = a0 ei\u03b50 t e\u2212i(k0 r\u2212\u03b1)\n\n(42)\n\n\u03c8\u03020\u2020 = \u00e2\u2020 a0 e\u2212i(k0 r\u2212i\u03b1) ,\n\n(43)\n\nand the operator \u03c8\u03020\u2020 of the unit-field\n\nis given by\n\nwhere a0 = (2V0 \u03b50 )\u22121/2 and \u03b50 = [k20 + m20 ]1/2 [see, also Eqs. (3), (4) and (16)]. Notice, the field operators (41)\nand (43) are similar to the respective boson parts of the multimode operators (3) and (4). According to the general\ncorrespondence principle \u03b5 = h\u0124i = H for both the classical and quantum fields with an arbitrary number of particles.\nR \u221e \u2202\u03c8\u2217 0\n\u2217\n\u2217\n3\nTherefore the energy \u03b50 = H11 = 0 [ \u2202t0 \u2202\u03c8\n\u2202t + \u2207\u03c80 * \u2207\u03c80 + mn \u03c80 mm \u03c80 ]d x of a single particle (a boson unit-field)\nis given by\nZ\na0 e\u2212i(k0 r\u2212\u03b1) [(\u00e2\u2020 \u00e2 + \u00e2\u00e2\u2020 )/2][\u03b520 + k20 + m20 ]a0 ei(k0 r\u2212\u03b1) d3 x,\n(44)\n\u03b50 = H11 =\nV0\n\nor in the conventional (Dirac) notations\n\u03b50 = H11 = h\u03c80 |\u012411 |\u03c80 i = h1|\u0124|1i,\n\n(45)\n\n\u0124 = \u03b50 (\u00e2\u2020 \u00e2 + \u00e2\u00e2\u2020 )/2\n\n(46)\n\nwhere\n\nis the Hamiltonian operator of the quantum unit-field (boson) presented in the form, which does not depend on the\norder of the operators \u00e2 and \u00e2\u2020 . Equation (44) yields the \"commutator like\" relation (\u00e2\u2020 \u00e2 + \u00e2\u00e2\u2020 )/2 = 1. One can use\nalso the equivalent non-symmetric operator\n\u0124 = \u03b50 \u00e2\u2020 \u00e2,\n\n(47)\n\n\u0124 = \u03b50 \u00e2\u00e2\u2020 ,\n\n(48)\n\nor\n\nwith the \"commutator like\" relation \u00e2\u2020 \u00e2 = \u00e2\u00e2\u2020 = 1. Note that the energy of the quantum unit-field (boson) describing\nby the operator equations (44)-(46) can be considered, in terms of the virtual processes (transitions) of the traditional\nparticle field theory, as the product of the virtual processes of the simultaneous creation and destruction of the unit-field\n(boson) at the every time moment t. If a quantum unit-field (boson) is absent (\u03c80 (r) = \u03c8\u03020 (r) = 0*\u03c80 (r) = 0* \u03c8\u03020 (r) = 0)\nin the volume V0 , then the energy of the empty space associated with the absence of the boson in this volume is equal\nto zero:\nZ\n[0 * a0 ]e\u2212i(k0 r\u2212\u03b1) [(\u00e2\u2020 \u00e2 + \u00e2\u00e2\u2020 )/2][\u03b520 + k20 + m20 ][0 * a0 ]ei(k0 r\u2212\u03b1) d3 x = 0\n(49)\nH00 =\nV0\n\nor in the Dirac notations\nH00 = h0 * \u03c80 |\u012400 |0 * \u03c80 i = 0 * h\u03c80 |\u012400 |\u03c80 i = h0|\u0124|0i = 0.\n\n(50)\n\nThat also means the unit-wave (unit-field) with zero amplitude has zero energy. It should be stressed that the\nquantum particle energy H11 calculated by using the operator equation (44) is equal to the Planck-Einstein energy\n\u03b50 = \u03c90 = (k20 + m20 )1/2 of a single boson, as well as to the energy of the \"non-quantum\" unit-field describing by\nthe non-operator equation (15). Remember that the division of the \"non-quantum\" field \u03c8 into the indivisible \"nonquantum\" unit-fields \u03c80n [see, Eqs. (15)-(39)], in fact, is the second quantization of the field without the use of the\nfield operators. Therefore, the energy of the \"non-quantum\" unit-field describing by the non-operator equation (15),\nin fact, is the quantum energy of the quantum unit-field (particle) in the field of operators. If the unit-field (boson)\n\n\f16\n\nEnergy\n\nepart.= e\n\n0\n\n1\n+2\n\ne\n\n0\n\nepart.= e\nevac. = 12 e\n\n0\n\n0\n\nevac. = 0\n\n0\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nFIG. 1: (a) The particle (\u03b5part. = H11 ) and vacuum (\u03b5vac. = H00 ) energies in the traditional quantum field theory.

Here,\n\u03b50 = \u03c90 = (k20 + m20 )1/2 is the Planck-Einstein particle energy.\n\nis absent in the volume V0 , then the vacuum quantum energy (49), the Planck-Einstein energy of the empty volume,\nand the \"non-quantum\" unit-field energy (15) of the empty space (zero-energy of a zero-amplitude unit-wave) are\nequal to zero. In order to obtain the non-zero vacuum energy in the present model, one can impose the additional\ncondition for the operator pairs, namely the canonical commutation relation [\u00e2, \u00e2\u2020 ] = 1 of quantum mechanics and\nparticle field theory. The use of this commutation relation in Eqs. (44) and (49) yields\nh1|\u0124|1i = \u03b50 + (1/2)\u03b50\n\n(51)\n\nh0|\u0124|0i = 0,\n\n(52)\n\nand\n\nrespectively. The quantum energy (51), which is equal to the canonical quantum energy of a single boson in particle\nfield theory [3, 4, 12\u201319], is different from the Planck-Einstein particle energy \u03b50 = \u03c90 = (k20 + m20 )1/2 and the particle\nenergy (15) of the \"non-quantum\" unit-field (particle). The vacuum energy (52) could be in artificial agreement with\nthe canonical quantum value h0|\u0124|0i = \u03b50 /2 if the zero energy H00 = 0 determining by Eq. (49) is assumed to\nbe equal to \u03b50 /2. Mathematically, that means the redefinition (0 * a 6= 0) of the canonical zero. Then the particle\nenergy (51) can be presented in the form h1|\u0124|1i = \u03b50 + (1/2)\u03b50 = h1|\u0124|1i + h0|\u0124|0i, which corresponds to the\nparticle energy of traditional quantum field theories. In such a case, the half of the boson energy (mass m0 ) remains\nin the volume V0 when a boson leaves this volume. In other words, the half of the boson remains in the volume.\nFurthermore, the infinite energy (mass) of the half-particles is accumulated in the volume V0 if the infinite number\nof bosons leaves this volume. Although the canonical values h1|\u0124|1i = \u03b50 + (1/2)\u03b50 and h0|\u0124|0i = (1/2)\u03b50 of the\nparticle field theory [3, 4, 12\u201319] can be obtained by the above-described artificial increase of the energies (44) and\n(49) on the value \u03b50 /2, I will not use this procedure. In the present model, the particle quantum energy (44) is equal\nto the Planck-Einstein particle energy \u03b50 = \u03c90 = (k20 + m20 )1/2 , as well as to the particle energy (15) of the \"nonquantum\" unit-field (particle), but is different from the canonical value of quantum field theory. The vacuum energy\nH00 = h0|\u012400 |0i = 0 determining by Eq. (49), which is the quantum energy of an empty volume, is in agreement with\nthe Planck-Einstein vacuum energy (Fig. 1). One should not confuse here the vacuum energy of the Einstein spacial\nrelativity and Newton mechanics having the \"straight\" geometry of the spacetime field with that of the spacetime\n\"curve\" geometry of the Einstein general relativity. The energies of the \"straight\" space (absolute vacuum) of the\nEinstein spacial relativity and Newton mechanics are equal to zero, while the energy of the Einstein \"curve\" space\n(non-absolute vacuum) has the non-zero value. Here, one should not confuse also the absolute minimum \u03b5min\n= m0\n0\nof the energy of the unit-field (particle) with the minimum of the canonical vacuum energy h0|\u0124|0i = m0 /2 connected\nwith the particle. It could be mentioned, in this regard, that the problem of negative energies of the antiparticles of\ntraditional quantum field theories will be discussed in the context of the present model at the end of Sec. (2.1.3).\n\n\f17\nWe now consider the Hamiltonian operator of the superposition of quantum operator unit-fields.

(17) and\n(18) for an arbitrary number of the unit waves (particles). This result is different from the traditional particle field\ntheory, where the quantum and classical values are in agreement in the case of very big number of particles, only. The\nquantum Hamiltonian H of the N cross-correlating unit-waves \u03c80n (r) determining by the field operators is given by\nH=\n\nN\nX\n\nn=1\n\nHnn +\n\n2\nNX\n\u2212N\n\nn6=m\n\nHnm ,\n\n(63)\n\n\f18\nwhere the \"self-correlation\" energy\nN\nX\n\nn=1\n\nHnn = \u03b50 N,\n\n(64)\n\nand the cross-correlation energy\n2\nNX\n\u2212N\n\nn6=m\n\nHnm =\n\n2\nNX\n\u2212N\n\nn6=m\n\nZ\n\nVnm\n\n[(\u00e2\u2020n \u00e2m + \u00e2n \u00e2\u2020m )/2][\u03b50n \u03b50m + k0n k0m + m0n m0m ]a0n a0m e\u2212i(\u2206k0nm r\u2212\u2206\u03b1nm ) d3 x,\n\n(65)\n\nwith the commutation-like relation\n(\u00e2\u2020n \u00e2m + \u00e2n \u00e2\u2020m )/2 = ei\u2206\u03b50nm t .\n\n(66)\n\nNotice, the relation (66) is obtained by comparison of Eq. (65) with the time-dependent part of Eq. (19). In the case\nof the \"non-quantum\" unit-fields considered in the previous section, the cross-correlation energy has been attributed to\nthe ordinary interference phenomenon. The cross-correlation energy of the quantum fields describing by the operators\ncould be attributed to the quantum interference phenomenon. Notice, the ordinary and quantum interference are\nindistinguishable phenomena in the present model. That means that the \"non-quantum\" and quantum energies\nare equal to each other for an arbitrary number of the unit-field (particles). In the terms of the virtual processes\n(transitions) of the traditional particle field theory, the quantum cross-correlation energy can be considered as the\nproduct of the virtual exchange of the indistinguishable unit-fields (bosons) [see, Eq. (65)]. In other words, the\ncross-correlation energy could be attributed to the simultaneous creation and destruction of the unit-field (boson)\n\u03c80n (r) and the simultaneous destruction and creation of the unit-field (boson) \u03c80m (r). The cross-correlation in such\na virtual process is associated with the indistinguishableness of identical unit-fields \u03c80n (r) and \u03c80m (r) under the\ninterference (interaction). The total energy of the interfering unit-fields [see, Eq. (63)] consists of the self-correlation\nenergy (57) and the cross-correlation energy (65), which do correspond to the simultaneous creation/destruction of\nthe unit-fields (bosons) \u03c80n (r) and the simultaneous destruction/creation of the unit-fields (bosons) \u03c80m (r) in the\nself-correlation and cross-correlation (interference) processes. The virtual quantum exchange of the indistinguishable\nunit-waves (particles) under the non-quantum or quantum interference is quite similar to the exchange of virtual\nparticles for a short time (\u2206t \u2264 1/\u2206\u03b5) in the traditional perturbative particle field theory. It should be stressed,\nhowever, that the cross-correlation energy (65) does not exist in canonical quantum mechanics and particle field theory\nbased on the Copenhagen-Dirac postulate of \"interference-less\", self-interfering particles [3, 4, 12\u201319].\nIn the case of V0n = V0m = V0 , m0n = m0m = m0 and k0n = k0m = k0 , Eqs. (63)-(66) yielded the equation\nH = \u03b50 N +\n\n2\nNX\n\u2212N\n\nn6=m\n\nZ\n\nV0\n\n[(\u00e2\u2020n \u00e2m + \u00e2n \u00e2\u2020m )/2][\u03b50 2 + k20 + m20 ]a0n a0m ei\u2206\u03b1mn d3 x,\n\n(67)\n\nwhich in the Dirac notations is given by\nH = h\u03c8|\n\nN\nX\n\nn=1\n\n\u0124nn +\n\n2\nNX\n\u2212N\n\nn6=m\n\n\u0124nm |\u03c8i = hN |\u0124|N i = \u03b50 hN |N\u0302 |N i = \u03b50 N ,\n\n(68)\n\nwhere the Hamiltonian operator\n\u0124 = \u03b50 N\u0302 ,\n\n(69)\n\nand the effective number of the cross-correlating unit-waves (particles), which can be a non-integer, is given by\nN = hN |N\u0302 |N i = \u03b5\u22121\n0 hN |\u0124|N i\n\n(70)\n\nwith the effective number operator\nN\u0302 = N\u0302 +\n\n2\nNX\n\u2212N\n\nn6=m\n\n[(\u00e2\u2020n \u00e2m\n\n+\n\n\u00e2n \u00e2\u2020m )/2]ei\u2206\u03b1mn\n\n= N\u0302 +\n\n2\nNX\n\u2212N\n\nn6=m\n\nei\u2206\u03b1mn .\n\n(71)\n\n\f19\nNotice, in Eqs. (67)-(71), I used the relation\n(\u00e2\u2020n \u00e2m + \u00e2n \u00e2\u2020m )/2 = (\u00e2\u2020 \u00e2 + \u00e2\u00e2\u2020 )/2 = 1,\n\n(72)\n\nwhich could be attributed to the indistinguishableness of the identical unit-waves (particles) that satisfy the condition\nV0n = V0m = V0 , m0n = m0m = m0 and k0n = k0m = k0 . One can easily demonstrate that the energy of the\ncross-correlating unit-waves describing by Eqs. (67)-(72) is given by\n0 \u2264 H \u2264 N 2 \u03b50 ,\n\n(73)\n\n0 \u2264 N \u2264 N 2.\n\n(74)\n\nand the respective effective number of the waves\n\nEquations (68) and (70) yielded the energy H = N 2 \u03b50 and the effective number N = N 2 for the pure additive\ninterference (\u2206\u03b1mn = 0). The pure subtractive interference results into annihilation of the unit-waves and energy. The\nannihilation takes place if the pairs of unit-wave operators satisfy the phase condition \u03b1m \u2212\u03b1n = \u00b1\u03c0. The annihilation\nb\nab\nb\nab\n\u03c8\u03020n\n(r, t) + \u03c8\u03020n\n(r, t) = 0 of the boson and antiboson operators \u03c8\u03020n\n(r, t) and \u03c8\u03020n\n(r, t) = 0 can be represented as the\npure subtractive interference of the boson unit-field operators\nb\n(r, t) = \u00e2a0 ei(k0 r\u2212\u03b1n )\n\u03c8\u03020n\n\n(75)\n\nab\n\u03c8\u03020n\n(r, t) = b\u0302a0 ei(k0 r\u2212\u03b1n ) ,\n\n(76)\n\nwith the antiboson unit-field operators\n\nb\nab\nb\nwhere b\u0302 = \u00e2e\u00b1i\u03c0 . Similarly, the annihilation \u03c8\u02c6\u2020 0n (r, t) + \u03c8\u02c6\u2020 0n (r, t) = 0 of the boson \u03c8\u02c6\u2020 0n (r, t) and antiboson\nab\n\u03c8\u02c6\u2020 0n (r, t) = 0 operators can be presented as the pure subtractive interference of the operators\nb\n\u03c8\u02c6\u2020 0n (r, t) = \u00e2\u2020 a0 e\u2212i(k0 r\u2212\u03b1n )\n\n(77)\n\nab\n\u03c8\u02c6\u2020 0n (r, t) = b\u0302\u2020 a0 e\u2212i(k0 r\u2212\u03b1n )\n\n(78)\n\nwith the operators\n\nwhere b\u0302\u2020 = \u00e2\u2020 e\u00b1i\u03c0 . For instance, the pure subtractive interference of the boson field operators\n\u03c8\u0302 b (r, t) =\n\nNb\nX\n\nb\n\u03c8\u03020n\n(r, t)\n\n(79)\n\nab\n\u03c8\u03020n\n(r, t),\n\n(80)\n\nn=1\n\nwith the antiboson field operators\nab\n\n\u03c8\u0302 (r, t) =\n\nNab\nX\n\nn=1\n\nresults into annihilation of the fields and energy if Nb = Nab . It should be noted that the unit-wave operators do\nannihilate partially if \u03b1n \u2212 \u03b1m = \u00b1\u03c0 \u00b1 \u03b4, where |\u03b4| < \u03c0. In order to provide the annihilation of a boson unit-wave\noperator with an antiboson unit-wave operator for the arbitrary momentum (wave-number) vectors and phases, the\noperators should satisfy the annihilation condition\n\u03c8\u03020b (r, t; kb0 , \u03b1b ) + \u03c8\u03020ab (r, t; kab\n0 , \u03b1ab ) = 0\n\n(81)\n\nindependently from the values of the momentums (wave-numbers) and phases. In such a case, the antiboson unitfield operator is the true antiparticle unit-field operator, which cannot be obtained by the phase shift of the boson\nfield operator. In the case of kb0 = kab\n0 = \u03b1b = \u03b1ab = 0, the massive (m0 6= 0) fields only satisfy the condition\n(81). The mass-less fields do not have the true antiparticle unit-fields (antiparticles) and the respective antiparticle\noperators. Notice, the annihilation condition (81) applied to the boson-antiboson pair yields the commutation-like\nrelation (\u00e2\u2020 \u00e2 + b\u0302b\u0302\u2020 + \u00e2\u2020 b\u0302 + b\u0302\u00e2\u2020 ) = 0. Notice, the positive energy-mass \u03b50 = (k20 + m20 )1/2 of antibosons in the\n\n\f20\npresent model is different from the negative energy-mass of the Dirac antiparticles satisfying the energy-mass relation\n\u03b50 = \u2212(k20 + m20 )1/2 .\nThe second quantization based on the replacement of the cross-correlating fields by the respective field operators\ncan be applied for other physical parameters,\nsuch as momentum, number of waves, mass and charge. For instance,\nP\nthe momentum P of the field \u03c8(r, t) = N\n\u03c8\nn=1 0n (r, t) is given by\nP = P i ei = h\u03c8|P\u0302 i |\u03c8iei ,\n\n(82)\n\nwhere\ni\n\nP\u0302 =\n\nN\nX\n\nn=1\n\ni\nk0n\n\n+\n\n2\nNX\n\u2212N\n\nn6=m\n\nZ\n\nVnm\n\ni\ni\n[(\u00e2\u2020n \u00e2m + \u00e2n \u00e2\u2020m )/2][\u03b50n k0m\n+ \u03b50m k0n\n]a0n a0m e\u2212i(\u2206k0nm r\u2212\u2206\u03b1nm ) d3 x.\n\n(83)\n\nIn the case of V0n = V0m = V0 , m0n = m0m = m0 and k0n = k0m = k0 , Eq. (83) yields\nP = N k0 = h\u03c8|N\u0302 |\u03c8ik0 ,\n\n(84)\n\nwhere N\u0302 is the effective number operator (71) of the waves. Notice, the angular momentum L and the respective\noperator of the interfering unit-fields can be found byP\nthe similar generalization of the angular momentum L = r \u00d7 P\nor the relativistic angular momentum tensor Lnm = (xn pm \u2212 xm pn ). The generalized rest mass M of the system\naccording to Eqs. (68) and (70) with k0 \u2192 0 (respectively, \u03b50 \u2192 m0 ) is given by\nM = N m0 = h\u03c8|N\u0302 |\u03c8im0\n\n(85)\n\nwith 0 \u2264 M \u2264 N 2 m0 . In the case of the pure subtractive interference of the boson field with the antiboson field, the\nfield energy can be formally presented as the absolute value of the sum of the positive energy of the boson unit-field\nwith the negative energy of the antiboson field in the interference process. Respectively, the generalized rest mass\nM is given by the absolute value of the sum of the positive mass of the boson field with the \"negative mass\" of the\nantiboson field:\nM = |Nb m0 + Nab (\u2212m0 )| = |h\u03c8\u03020b |N\u0302 |\u03c8\u03020b im0 \u2212 h\u03c8\u03020ab |N\u0302ab |\u03c8\u03020ab im0 |.\n\n(86)\n\nIt should be stressed that the mass-energies of particles and antiparticles are positive. The negative sign in Eq. (86)\nreflects only a subtractive character of the interaction (interference). Notice, the positive rest energy-mass \u03b50 =\n(m20 )1/2 of antibosons in the present model is different from the negative rest energy-mass \u03b50 = \u2212(m20 )1/2 of the Dirac\nantiparticles. If the unit-charge q0 is associated with the mass m0 of the unit-wave \u03c80n (r, t) [see comments to Eqs.\n(123) and (124), and Figs. (5)-(8)], in other words, if the unit wave \u03c80n (r) has the unit charge q0 , then the effective\ncharge Q of the cross-correlating unit-fields is given by\nQ = N q0 = h\u03c8|N\u0302 |\u03c8iq0 ,\n\n(87)\n\nwhere 0 \u2264 Q \u2264 N 2 q0 . Similarly, if the magnetic moment ~\u03bc0 is associated with the mass m0 of the unit-wave \u03c80n (r),\n~ (0 \u2264 M\n~ \u2264 N 2\u03bc\nthen the effective magnetic moment M\n~ 0 ) of the cross-correlating unit-fields is given by\n~ = N ~\u03bc0 .\nM\n\n(88)\n\nIn the case of the pure subtractive interference of the boson field with the antiboson field he effective charge is given\nby the sum of the positive charge of the boson field with the negative charge of the antiboson field:\nQ = Nb q0 + Nab (\u2212q0 ) = h\u03c8\u03020b |N\u0302 |\u03c8\u03020b iq0 \u2212 h\u03c8\u03020ab |N\u0302ab |\u03c8\u03020ab iq0 .\n\n(89)\n\nNotice, although the boson parameters associated with the charge have been formally introduced [see, Eqs. (87)-(89)]\ninto the scalar boson model, the existence or nonexistence of the boson/antiboson charges is determined rather by\nthe experiment than the model. The introduction of the antibosons into the model also should correspond to the\nexperimental observations of the concrete field.\nIn the context of physical interpretations of the above-presented model, one should mention that the unit-fields\n(particles) of the present model are not the point particles of quantum field theory. In the particle field theory, the\nphysical interpretation of the wave (field) of operators as the real physical object is very problematic. An operator\nis a pure mathematical object, which should not be interpreted as a real physical matter. In the present model,\n\n\f21\nthe division of the real \"non-quantum\" field \u03c8 of the matter (mass-energy) into the indivisible \"non-quantum\" unitfields \u03c80n of the matter (mass-energy) [see, Eqs. (15)-(39)], in fact, is the second quantization of the field without\nthe use of the fields of operators. The above-presented model of the boson quantum-fields based on the operator\nrepresentation of the fields is equivalent to the \"non-quantum\" model of the real unit-fields of the matter considered\nin Sec. (2.1.2.). That means the physical parameters describing by Eqs. (40)-(89) are equal to the respective values\nderived in Sec. (2.1.2.) without the use of the fields of operators. In the case of the fields (waves), which are free from\nthe cross-correlation associated with the ordinary interference phenomenon, the above-derived number of unit-waves,\nmagnetic moment, mass and charge of the waves are equal to the respective values of the traditional particle field\ntheory. However, the calculated energy \u03b50 = \u03c90 = (k20 + m20 )1/2 and momentum p0 = k0 of a unit-wave (particle),\nwhich are equal to the Planck-Einstein energy and momentum of the particle, are different from the canonical values\n\u03b50 = \u03c90 + (1/2)\u03c90 and p0 = k0 + (1/2)k0 of the traditional particle field theory [4, 12\u201319]. The positive energy-mass\n\u03b50 = (k20 + m20 )1/2 of antibosons in the above-described model is different from the negative energy-mass of the Dirac\nantiparticles satisfying the energy-mass relation \u03b50 = \u2212(k20 + m20 )1/2 . The energy and momentum of the empty space,\nwhich are in agreement with the Planck-Einstein and classical physics of the vacuum, are equal to zero.\n2.1.4. Boson vector fields\n\nSo far we have considered the interferences between \"non-quantum\" and quantum scalar (s = 0) boson particles\n(unit-fields). The cross-correlation model of the interfering boson unit-fields having the spin s > 0 would be similar\nto the model of scalar fields considered in the previous sections. One can easily follow the above-presented crosscorrelation model for an arbitrary value of the spin s. As an example, let me briefly describe the cross-correlating\nvector finite-fields composed from the mass-less vector unit-fields (vector bosons) having the spins s = 1. Such\nfields correspond to the electromagnetic (EM) finite-fields of the photons. The infinite EM field is described by the\ncanonical Lagrangian density L = (\u22121/4)\u03c8\u03bc\u03bd \u03c8 \u03bc\u03bd , where the 4-tensor \u03c8 \u03bc\u03bd is the field tensor F \u03bc\u03bd ; the 4-vector \u03c8 \u03bc\nis the 4-potential A\u03bc [4, 12\u201319]. According to the present model, the generalization of the canonical Lagrangian\n(Hamiltonian) and the second quantization should be performed for the superposition of the respective interfering\nunit-fields. The configuration and dynamics of the unit-field is determined by the Euler-Lagrange equation of motion\nwith the initial and boundary conditions imposed. The simplest wave-like solution \u03c80\u03bc of the equation for the unitfield, which is located infinitely far from the boundaries, is the time-harmonic plane wave. The operator \u03c8\u03020\u03bc of the\ncross-correlating, time-harmonic, plane, vector unit-wave\n\u2212i\u03b50 t i(k0 r\u2212\u03b1)\n\u03c80\u03bc (r, t) = a0\u03b1 u\u03b1\ne\n\u03bce\n\n(90)\n\nof the physical matter (vector boson, for instance, photon) is given by\ni(k0 r\u2212\u03b1)\n\u03c8\u03020\u03bc = \u00e2\u03b1 a0\u03b1 u\u03b1\n,\n\u03bce\n\n(91)\n\n\u2020\nand the operator \u03c8\u03020\u03bc\nof the unit-wave\n\u2217\n\n\u2217\ni\u03b50 t \u2212i(k0 r\u2212\u03b1)\n\u03c80\u03bc\n(r, t) = a0\u03b1 u\u03b1\ne\n\u03bc e\n\n(92)\n\nis given by\n\u2217\n\n\u2020\n\u2212i(k0 r\u2212\u03b1)\n\u03c8\u03020\u03bc\n= \u00e2\u2020\u03b1 a0\u03b1 u\u03b1\n,\n\u03bc e\n\n(93)\n\nwhere a0\u03b1 is the wave amplitude. The unit 4-vector of polarization is given by u\u03b1\n\u03bc , where the index \u03b1 corresponds to\nthe two independent polarizations. Then the operators of the finite fields\n\u03c8\u03bc (r, t) =\n\nN\nX\n\n\u03c80\u03bcn (r, t)\n\n(94)\n\n\u2217\n\u03c80\u03bcn\n(r, t),\n\n(95)\n\nn=1\n\nand\n\u03c8\u03bc\u2217 (r, t) =\n\nN\nX\n\nn=1\n\n\f22\n\u2217\nwhich are the superpositions of the respective unit-fields \u03c80\u03bcn (r, t) and \u03c80\u03bcn\n(r, t), could be presented respectively as\n\n\u03c8\u0302\u03bc =\n\nN\nX\n\n\u03c8\u03020\u03bcn\n\n(96)\n\n\u2020\n\u03c8\u03020\u03bcn\n.\n\n(97)\n\nn=1\n\nand\n\u03c8\u0302\u03bc\u2020 =\n\nN\nX\n\nn=1\n\nNotice, the superpositions (94) and (95) may be reinterpreted as the Fourier decomposition of the field composed\nfrom the indivisible, time-harmonic, plane unit-waves (plane-wave photons). One should not confuse here the planewave photon with the non-plane unit-wave, for instance, with the spherical-wave photon. The Fourier decomposition\ncould be useful in an analysis of the near-field and sub-wavelength phenomena (see, Sec. 4.2.), where the non-plane\nunit-wave (indivisible non-plane photon) producing near to the sharp boundaries is presented formally as the Fourier\ndecomposition of the plane-wave photons. The boson vector fields (EM fields) describing by Eqs. (90)-(97) do not have\nthe rest mass (m0 = 0). It is not necessary to repeat all the mathematical procedures of Secs. (2.1.2.) and (2.1.3.)\nfor the mass-less vector unit-fields (photons). One can easily demonstrate that the physical parameters [for instance,\nenergy, momentum and number of the unit-waves (photons)] in the linearly polarized EM fields are described by the\nrespective equations of Secs. (2.1.2.) and (2.1.3.) with the particle rest mass m0 = 0 and energy \u03b50 = k0 , which\ncorrespond to the rest mass and energy of the Planck-Einstein photon. In the case of the fields with the two different\npolarizations, the summations of the kind\nN\nX\n\n(...) +\n\nn=1\n\n2\nNX\n\u2212N\n\n(...)\n\n(98)\n\n(...)\u03b4\u03b1n \u03b1m ,\n\n(99)\n\nn6=m\n\nin the equations should be replaced by\nX\n\nn=1;\u03b1n\n\n(...) +\n\nX\n\nn6=m;\u03b1n ,\u03b1m\n\nwhere the index \u03b1 corresponds to the two independent polarizations, and \u03b4\u03b1n \u03b1m is the Kronecker symbol. For further\ndetails see the introduction and preliminary investigation of the cross-correlation and cross-correlation energy of the\nclassical and quantum EM fields presented in Refs. [24](a-c). It could be noted that Eqs. (35), (36), (85), and (86)\ndescribe the \"moving mass\" of the cross-correlating EM fields that have the rest mass m0 = 0 in these equations.\nThe fields (94) - (97), which have the positive energies, could annihilate each other if \u03b1m \u2212 \u03b1n = \u00b1\u03c0 for the unit-field\n(photon) pairs. From a point of view of the first photon of the annihilated photon pair the second photon may be\nconsidered formally as an anti-photon. In order to provide the annihilation of an EM unit-wave (photon) by another\nEM unit-wave (anti-photon), the unit-waves should satisfy the annihilation conditions (28) and (81) for the arbitrary\nmomentum (wave-number) vectors and phases. In such a case, the anti-photon would be the true antiparticle unitfield, which cannot be obtained by the phase shift of an EM unit-wave (photon). The EM fields do not satisfy the\naforementioned annihilation conditions. Therefore the EM fields do not have the true antiparticle unit-fields (antiphotons). That is in agreement with the experimental fact that the mass-less (m0 = 0) unit-field (photon) has zero\ncharge, q0 = 0.\n2.1.5. Fermion fields\n\nIt is clear that the cross-correlation model of the \"non-quantum\" and quantum fields of the interfering fermions\n(unit-fields with half-integer spin s) should be similar to the above-considered boson fields. As an example, let me\nbriefly describe the cross-correlating \"non-quantum\" and quantum fermion finite-fields with the unit-fields (spinor\nparticles) having the spin s = 1/2. Such finite fields correspond to the finite fields of spinor particles, fore instance,\nelectrons. The Dirac infinite spinor field, which is free from the cross-correlation (interference), is described by the\nLagrangian density L = i\u03c8\u0304\u03b3 \u03bc \u2202\u03bc \u03c8 \u2212 m\u03c8\u0304\u03c8 [4, 12\u201319]. According to the present model, the generalization of the\ncanonical Lagrangian (Hamiltonian) and the second quantization should be performed for the superposition of the\nrespective interfering unit-fields (spinors). The configuration and dynamics of the unit-field is determined by the\n\n\f23\nEuler-Lagrange equation of motion, which is indistinguishable from the Dirac equation of motion, with the initial\nand boundary conditions imposed.

(2.1.2.) and (2.1.3.) for the unit-fields (spinor\nparticles). One can easily demonstrate that the physical parameters [for instance, energy, momentum and number of\nthe unit-waves (spinors)] are described by the respective equations of Secs. (2.1.2.) and (2.1.3.).

For details, see Sec. II and comments to Eqs. (123) and (124), and Figs. (5)(8)]. The Pauli principle states that no two identical fermions may occupy the same quantum state simultaneously.\nIt could be noted again that the dynamics of the above-considered spinor finite-fields is determined by the EulerLagrange (Dirac) equation of motion with the initial and boundary conditions imposed. The physical parameters of\nthe cross-correlating relativistic fields are described by the respective equations of Secs. (2.1.2.) and (2.1.3.), where the\n\n\f24\nunit-fields (spinor particles or electrons) have the relativistic energy \u03b50 = (k20 +m20 )1/2 . The physical parameters of the\nnon-relativistic (k0 \u2192 0) cross-correlating fields are described by these equations, where the unit-field energy is given\nby \u03b50 \u2248 (k20 /2m0 ) + m0 . In the present model, the transition from the relativistic cross-correlating spinor finite fields\nto non-relativistic ones is similar to the transition from the relativistic infinite field describing by the Dirac equation of\nmotion with the resonator-like boundary conditions to the finite waves of probabilities (finite wave-functions), whose\ndynamics is determined by the Schr\u00f6dinger equation with the quantum-mechanics boundary conditions imposed. It\nshould be mentioned that the positive energy-mass of a spinor antiparticle described in the Part II of the present study\nis different from the negative energy-mass of antiparticle (positron) in the Dirac field theory, which is based on the\nCopenhagen-Dirac postulate of \"interference-less\", self-interfering particles and the particle (antiparticle) energy-mass\n\u03b50 = \u00b1(k20 + m20 )1/2 . Notice, in contrast to the traditional interpretation of the Dirac infinite field by the quantum\nfield theory, the Dirac equation was originally formulated and interpreted by the author as a single-particle equation\nanalogous to the Schr\u00f6dinger single-particle equation.\n3. FORCES MEDIATED BY GRADIENTS OF THE CROSS-CORRELATION ENERGY\n\nThis section considers the general properties of the forces (interactions) between the interfering particles (bodies)\ncausing by gradients of the cross-correlation energy. In modern physics, generally speaking, there are two kinds of\nphysical mechanisms that describe the forces (interactions) between particles [3\u20135, 12\u201319]. According to quantum field\ntheories, the forces acting upon a particle are seen as the action of the respective gauge-boson field that is present\nat the particle location. In the perturbative approximation, the forces are attributed to the exchange of the field\nvirtual particles (gauge bosons). In the Einstein theory of general relativity, the gravitational interaction between two\nobjects (particles) is not viewed as a force, but rather, objects moving freely in gravitational fields travel under their\nown inertia in straight lines through \"curve\" spacetime. I should show that the physical mechanism behind the forces\ninducing by gradients of the cross-correlation energy is similar to the two aforementioned traditional mechanisms.\nLet me describe the forces mediating by gradients of the cross-correlation energy of the interfering particles (unitfields) in the form, which does not depend on the kind of the particles. For the sake of simplicity, we first consider\nthe cross-correlation (interaction) of the two unit-fields (particles). According to the present model [for the scalar\nbosons that interfere with each other, see Eqs. (6), (7) and (9)], the total energy H of the two arbitrary unit-fields\n\u03c801 (r, t) and \u03c802 (r, t) at the time moment t = t12 is calculated by integrating the Hamiltonian density h in the space.\nIn the general form, the Hamiltonian contains the canonical energies of the single fields \u03c801 and \u03c802 , which occupy\nrespectively the volumes V1 \u2261 V11 and V2 \u2261 V22 , and the cross-correlation energies of the fields overlapped in the\ncommon volume V12 = V21 at the time moment t12 :\nH=\n\n2\nX\n\nn=1\n\nHnn +\n\n2\nX\n\nn6=m\n\nHnm =\n\n2 Z\nX\n\nn=1\n\n3\n\nhnn d x +\n\nVnn\n\n2 Z\nX\n\nn6=m\n\nhnm d3 x,\n\n(110)\n\nVnm\n\nwhere hnm is the Hamiltonian density, which takes into account the interference between particles, namely the\ninterference of the unit-fields \u03c801 (r1 , t12 ) \u2261 \u03c81 (r1 ) with \u03c802 (r2 , t12 ) \u2261 \u03c82 (r2 ). In the case of the two identical\nparticles, the unit-fields are described by \u03c81 (r1 ) \u2261 \u03c8(r), \u03c82 (r2 ) \u2261 \u03c8(r + R), \u03c81\u2217 (r1 ) \u2261 \u03c8 \u2217 (r) and \u03c82\u2217 (r2 ) \u2261 \u03c8 \u2217 (r + R),\nwhere R is the distance between the unit-fields (particles) [see, the illustration for the non-complex unit-fields in Fig.\n2]. The particle energies H11 and H22 , which depend on neither the coordinate r nor the time t after the integration\nover the volumes V11 and V22 , are permanent (constant). The cross-correlation energy H12,21 \u2261 H12 + H21 , however,\ndepends on the overlapping (interference) of the fields \u03c81 (r) with \u03c82 (r + R). For more details see Secs. (1) and\n(2). The cross-correlation energy H12,21 , which depends on the distance R between the particles (unit-fields), can be\npresented as the potential energy H12,21 (R) = H12 (R) + H21 (R). Then the force F causing by the gradient of the\ncross-correlation energy is given by\nF=\u2212\n\n\u2202H\n\u2202H\n= \u2212 i ei ,\n\u2202R\n\u2202R\n\n(111)\n\nwith\n\u2202H\n=\n\u2202Ri\n\n\u2202\n[h (r, r + R) + h21 (r, r + R)]d3 x,\ni 12\nV12 \u2202R\n\nZ\n\n(112)\n\nwhere h12 (r, r + R) + h21 (r, r + R) = h12,21 (r, r) denotes the density of the cross-correlation energy, and r = xi ei and\nR = Ri ei .

It should be stressed that Eqs. (110)-(114)\ndo not depend on the kind of the unit-fields (particles). One can easily apply these equations for the boson and\nfermion fields of any kind. The quantization (second quantization) of the non-quantum fields by replacing the fields\nby the respective field operators does not change Eqs. (110)-(114) [see, Sec. 2]. Thus the quantum cross-correlation\nenergies and respective forces of the fields of operators are equal to the non-quantum values of the \"non-quantum\"\nunit-fields of the matter (mass-energy) described in Sec. (2). Although the properties of the force (111) depend\non the concrete forms of the unit-fields \u03c801 (r1 ) and \u03c802 (r2 ), the several general properties can be derived without\nknowledge of the exact forms of the fields. For instance, if the Hamiltonian (110) is not invariant under the U (1) local\n\u2032\ngauge transformation (\u03c80n \u2192 \u03c80n\n= ei\u03b1n \u03c80n ), then the gauge symmetry breaking gives rise to the phase-dependent\ninterference between the unit-fields \u03c801 (r, t) \u2261 \u03c601 (r, t)ei\u03b11 and \u03c802 (r, t) \u2261 \u03c62 (r, t)ei\u03b12 resulting into the phasedependent interaction between particles by the gradient of the cross-correlation energy. The force (111) is attractive if\nthe gradient of the cross-correlation energy of the two-unit fields (particles) is positive. In such a case, the maximum\nand minimum of the total energy (110) are achieved in the limits R\u2192\u221e and R\u2192 0, respectively. In the case of the\nnegative gradient of the cross-correlation energy, the force (111) is repulsive. The maximum and minimum of the\ntotal energy of the repulsive unit-fields (particles) correspond respectively to the limits R\u2192 0 and R\u2192\u221e.\nIn the terms of virtual processes (transitions) of the traditional particle field theory, the quantum cross-correlation\nenergy and the respective force associated with the gradient of this energy can be considered as the product of the\nvirtual exchange of the indistinguishable unit-fields (particles) [see, Eq. (65)]. That is to say that the cross-correlation\nenergy and the force could be attributed to the simultaneous creation/destruction of the unit-field \u03c801 (r) and the\nsimultaneous destruction/creation of the unit-field \u03c802 (r). The cross-correlation in such a virtual process is associated\nwith the indistinguishableness of identical unit-fields \u03c801 (r) and \u03c802 (r) under the interference (interaction). The abovedescribed picture of the virtual quantum exchange of the indistinguishable unit-fields (particles) under the quantum\ninterference, which induces the interaction force associated with the gradient of the cross-correlation energy, is quite\n\n\f26\nsimilar to the exchange of virtual particles for a short time (\u2206t \u2264 1/\u2206\u03b5) in the perturbative particle field theory,\nwhere the forces are due to the exchange of the virtual particles (gauge bosons). It should be stressed, however,\nthat the cross-correlation energy associated with the interference between particles (unit-fields) does not exist in\nquantum mechanics and particle field theory based on the traditional interpretation of quantum interference [3, 4, 12\u2013\n19]. The picture of interaction of the particles by the cross-correlation of the unit-fields is also in agreement with\nthe Einstein theory of general relativity. According to this theory, the massive object motion, which in classical\nmechanics is ascribed to the action of the attractive force between two objects, corresponds to inertial motion of the\nobjects within a \"curve\" geometry of spacetime [5]. In general relativity there is no force deflecting objects from\ntheir natural, straight paths. Instead, the motion corresponds to changes in the properties of spacetime (spacetime\nfield), which in turn changes the straight paths that objects will naturally follow. The field curvature is caused by\nthe energy-momentum of matter. That is to say that the massive object determines the curvature of the spacetime\nfield, in turn, the spacetime field governs the matter motion. The physical mechanism of the forces associated with\nthe cross-correlation of massive unit-fields (particles) under the classical or quantum interference (interaction), which\nis described by Eqs. (110)-(114), is very similar to the Einstein mechanism. Indeed, the motion of the first unit-field\n(particle) \u03c81 in the presence of the second unit-field (particle) \u03c82 can be described by the following equation\ndp1\n\u2202H\n= \u2212 i ei ,\ndt\n\u2202R\n\n(115)\n\nwhere p1 \u2261 k1 is the momentum of the first unit-field (particle) at the time moment t = t12 , and \u2212[\u2202H/\u2202Ri ]ei = F\ndenotes the gravitational force. The motion is determined by the gradient (\"curvature\") of the density cross-correlation\nenergy (spacetime-like field term)\nh12,21 (r, r + R) = h12 (r, r + R) + h21 (r, r + R),\n\n(116)\n\nnamely by the gradient (\"curvature\")\n\u2202\n\u2202\nh12,21 (r, r + R) =\n[h12 (r, r + R) + h21 (r, r + R)]\n\u2202Ri\n\u2202Ri\n\n(117)\n\nof the spacetime-like field term in Eqs. (111) and (115). The change of the particle motion corresponds to changes\nin the properties of the spacetime-like field term, which, in turn, changes the straightest-possible paths that the first\nparticle will follow without presence of the non-quantum or quantum unit-field of the second particle. The gradient\n\"curvature\" (117) of the spacetime-like field term (116) is caused by the presence of the energy-momentum of matter\nof the second particle (unit-field). Without presence of the second particle, the gradient \"curvature\" (117) of the\nspacetime-like field term (116) is zero, and the first particle moves freely (dp1 /dt = 0). The change of the properties\nof the spacetime-like field term (116) can be considered as the change of the gradient (\"curvature\") (117) of the\nspacetime-like field term. Some physicists say that the massive bodies \"tell\" the spacetime how to \"curve\"; the\nspacetime term \"tells\" the bodies how to move. In the present model, the particles \"tell\" the spacetime-like field\nterm (116) how to \"curve\", and the spacetime-like field term \"tells\" the particles how to move. Mathematically, the\ngeneral relativity replaces the gravitational potential of classical physics by a symmetric rank-two field tensor. In the\npresent model, the gradient (\"curvature\") of the cross-correlation energy is also viewed rather as a symmetric rank-two\nfield tensor than the gravitational potential of Newton's mechanics. The force (111) corresponds to the attractive\ngravitational force if the gradient (\"curvature\") of the cross-correlation energy of the two unit-fields (particles) is\npositive. The force (111) corresponds to the repulsive gravitational force, if such a force does exist, in the case of the\nnegative gradient of the cross-correlation energy. Although the cross-correlation mechanism compare well with the\nNewton and Einstein mechanisms of gravitation forces, the cross-correlation energy-mass is the nonexistent energymass in both the classical physics and Einstein general relativity. It should be stressed again that the above-presented\nanalysis does not depend on the kind of the cross-correlating fields.\nIn order to make the above-presented general analysis more transparent let me consider several particular examples.\nThe following examples describe the static forces inducing by gradients of the cross-correlation energy in the ensemble\nof static (time-independent) boson scalar unit-fields \u03c80n (r, t) = \u03c80n (r). The static unit-fields \u03c80n (r) \u2261 \u03c8n (r) can\nbe treated formally as the fields with \u2202\u03c8n (r, t)/\u2202t = 0. The total energy of the two boson unit-fields is found by\nusing Eq. (6). For the two unit-fields (particles) with \u03c81 (r) \u2261 \u03c81 (r)ei\u03b11 , \u03c82 (r) \u2261 \u03c82 (r)ei\u03b12 , \u03c81\u2217 (r) \u2261 \u03c81\u2217 (r)e\u2212i\u03b11\nand \u03c82\u2217 (r) \u2261 \u03c82\u2217 (r)e\u2212i\u03b12 , which can be presented respectively as \u03c81 (r) = \u03c6(r)ei\u03b11 , \u03c82 (r) = \u03c6(r + R)ei\u03b12 , \u03c81\u2217 (r) =\n\u03c6\u2217 (r)e\u2212i\u03b11 , \u03c82\u2217 (r) = \u03c6\u2217 (r + R)e\u2212i\u03b12 [an illustration for the non-complex unit-fields (\u03c81 (r) = \u03c81\u2217 (r), \u03c82 (r) = \u03c82\u2217 (r)) is\nshown in Fig. 2], Eqs. (6) and (110) yielded the total energy\nH = H1 + H2 + H12,21 (R),\n\n(118)\n\n\f27\nwhere\nH1 + H2 =\n+\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\n0\n\n[m22 \u03c6\u2217 (r\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n\u221e\n\n[m21 \u03c6\u2217 (r)\u03c6(r) + \u2207\u03c6\u2217 (r)\u2207\u03c6(r)]d3 x +\n\n+ R)\u03c6(r + R) + \u2207\u03c6\u2217 (r + R)\u2207\u03c6(r + R)]d3 x.\n\n(119)\n\nis the part of the total energy, which does not depend on the distance R. Here, the term H12,21 (R) denotes the\ncross-correlation energy H12 (R) + H21 (R), and the self-correlation energies are given by H11 \u2261 H1 and H22 \u2261 H2 .\nIn order to satisfy the Einstein theory of relativity, the energy (119) should be equal to the Planck-Einstein energy\n\u03b5 = (k21 + m21 )1/2 + (k22 + m22 )1/2 of the two non-correlating unit-fields (particles):\nH1 + H2 = (k21 + m21 )1/2 + (k22 + m22 )1/2 .\nThe cross-correlation energy H12,21 (R), which depends on the distance R, is given by\nZ \u221e\nH12,21 (R) =\n(m1 m2 [e\u2212i(\u03b11 \u2212\u03b12 ) \u03c6\u2217 (r)\u03c6(r + R) + ei(\u03b11 \u2212\u03b12 ) \u03c6(r)\u03c6\u2217 (r + R)] +\n\n(120)\n\n0\n\n+[e\u2212i(\u03b11 \u2212\u03b12 ) \u2207\u03c6\u2217 (r)\u2207\u03c6(r + R) + ei(\u03b11 \u2212\u03b12 ) \u2207\u03c6(r)\u2207\u03c6\u2217 (r + R)])d3 x.\n\nThe force corresponding to the gradient of the cross-correlation energy is given by Eq.

(122), which corresponds to the term (121), depends on the coordinates, phases and the pure\ngeometry of the boson fields. Remember, that the operator representation [see, Sec. (2)] of the unit-fields \u03c8(r) and\n\u03c8(r + R) shows that the force (111) can be viewed as the product of the virtual exchange of the unit-fields (particles).\nIn other words, the force could be interpreted as the product of the virtual process of the creation/destruction of the\nparticle in the point (r, t) of the unit-field \u03c8(r, t) and the simultaneous destruction/creation of the unit-field (particle)\nin the same point (r, t) of the unit-field \u03c8(r + R, t) at the every time moment t. The pure geometrical nature of\nthe force can be emphasized by using the unit masses m1 = 1 and m2 = 1. In such a representation, the gradient\n(\"curvature\") (122) of the cross-correlation energy (121) is viewed rather as a symmetric rank-two field tensor of the\nEinstein general relativity than the gravitational potential of classical physics. From the point of view of the present\nmodel of the particle interactions, which is based on the gradient of the cross-correlation energy, the Einstein and\nquantum descriptions (interpretations) of the forces are equivalent. The difference between the models is in absence\nof the cross-correlation energy mediated by the interference between particles (bodies) in both the Einstein relativity\nand the particle field theory based on the canonical interpretation of quantum interference. The values of the energy\nand force could be calculated by using the concrete field functions \u03c8(r) and \u03c8(r + R). The attractive or repulsive\ncharacter of the force (111) is determined by the sign S = \u00b11 of the cross-correlation energy H12 (R). For an example,\nin the case of \u03c6(r) = \u03c6\u2217 (r) and \u03c6(r + R) = \u03c6\u2217 (r + R), the expressions (121) and (122) can be presented in the very\nsimple forms\nZ \u221e\nH12,21 (R) = 2SG\n[m1 \u03c6(r)m2 \u03c6(r + R) + \u2207\u03c6(r)\u2207\u03c6(r + R)]d3 x\n(123)\n0\n\nand\n\u2202H\n= 2SG\n\u2202Ri\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n\u221e\n\n\u2202\n[m1 \u03c6(r)m2 \u03c6(r + R) + \u2207\u03c6(r)\u2207\u03c6(r + R)]d3 x,\n\u2202Ri\n\n(124)\n\nwhere S = cos(\u03b11 \u2212 \u03b12 )/| cos(\u03b11 \u2212 \u03b12 )| and G = | cos(\u03b11 \u2212 \u03b12 )|. The sing S and the coupling parameter G are\ndimensionless constants, which are determined by the experimental data for the energy and force of the concrete boson\nunit-fields. If Eqs. (123) and (124) are applied formally to the fermion particles (electrons) with the spins s1 = \u00b11/2\nand s2 = \u00b11/2, then the sign S = cos(\u03b11 \u2212 \u03b12 )/| cos(\u03b11 \u2212 \u03b12 )| can be considered as the sign of the product SG \u223c s1 s1 ,\nwhich does not depend on the intrinsic or non-intrinsic angular momentums of the unit-fields (particles). Notice, the\nPlanck-Einstein energy (120) of the two unit-fields (particles) does not depend on the SG product associated with\n\n\f28\nthe spins s1 and s2 . The cross-correlation energy (123) may be reinterpreted as the Heisenberg-Dirac energy of the\nexchange interaction of the spins. The cross-correlation force mediating by the gradient of the energy (123) would\nbe attractive if the electrons have the different spins, s1 = \u00b11/2 and s2 = \u22131/2. This case corresponds to the phase\ndifference \u03c0/2 < \u03b11 \u2212 \u03b12 < 3\u03c0/2. The unit-waves with the phase difference \u03b11 \u2212 \u03b12 = \u03c0/2 or \u03b11 \u2212 \u03b12 = 3\u03c0/2 do not\ninterfere (interact) one with another. The force would be repulsive if the electrons are identical, s1 = s2 = \u00b11/2. The\nrepulsive force corresponds to the phase difference 0 < \u03b11 \u2212 \u03b12 < \u03c0/2 or 3\u03c0/2 < \u03b11 \u2212 \u03b12 < 2\u03c0. That is to say that the\ntwo identical fermions (unit-fields) cannot occupy the same single-particle states because the overlapped unit-fields\ncannot share the common volume due to the repulsive force. In the present model this could be interpreted as the Pauli\nexclusion principle. That means that the physical mechanism (interpretation) behind the Pauli principle in the present\nmodel is different from the quantum mechanics and particle field theory based on the waves of probabilities or the waves\nof operators. For instance, in quantum mechanics, the two-particle system is described by a symmetric (boson) or\nantisymmetric (fermion) state, which has been mathematically constructed by using the probability amplitudes (wavefunctions) of the particles. If the electrons are the same, the mathematically engineered antisymmetric expression\nof the state gives zero. Therefore, in an antisymmetric state, two identical particles cannot occupy the same singleparticle states. This is known as the Pauli exclusion principle, which in quantum mechanics has the pure mathematical\ninterpretation based on the mathematical properties of the antisymmetric state (function). In particle field theory,\nthe Pauli exclusion principle is attributed to the mathematical properties of the canonical commutation relation\n(pure mathematical object) of fermions. The mathematical construction of the antisymmetric state (function) in\nquantum mechanics or the canonical commutation relation of fermions in particle field theory yields the Fermi-Dirac\nstatistics, whose interpretation is also pure mathematical. Similarly, the modelling of the boson gas by a symmetric\nstate (function) or the use of the canonical commutation relation of bosons leads mathematically to the Bose-Einstein\nstatistics. In the present model, the physical mechanism behind the Bose-Einstein statistics, Fermi-Dirac statistics\nand Pauli exclusion principle is attributed to the attractive and repulsive forces associating with the subtractive and\nadditive interference (cross-correlation) of the real unit-waves (bosons or fermions) of the matter (mass-energy). It\nshould be noted (see, Eq. (121)) that the sign S1 of the product m1 m2 [e\u2212i(\u03b11 \u2212\u03b12 ) \u03c6\u2217 (r)\u03c6(r + R) + ei(\u03b11 \u2212\u03b12 ) \u03c6(r)\u03c6\u2217 (r +\nR)] can be different from the sign S2 of the product [e\u2212i(\u03b11 \u2212\u03b12 ) \u2207\u03c6\u2217 (r)\u2207\u03c6(r + R) + ei(\u03b11 \u2212\u03b12 ) \u2207\u03c6(r)\u2207\u03c6\u2217 (r + R)].\nTherefore the expressions (123) and (124) can be presented in the forms containing the signs S1 and S2 as\nZ \u221e\n(S1 m1 m2 |e\u2212i(\u03b11 \u2212\u03b12 ) \u03c6\u2217 (r)\u03c6(r + R) + ei(\u03b11 \u2212\u03b12 ) \u03c6(r)\u03c6\u2217 (r + R)| +\nH12,21 (R) =\n0\n\n+S2 |e\u2212i(\u03b11 \u2212\u03b12 ) \u2207\u03c6\u2217 (r)\u2207\u03c6(r + R) + ei(\u03b11 \u2212\u03b12 ) \u2207\u03c6(r)\u2207\u03c6\u2217 (r + R)|)d3 x.\n\n(125)\n\nand\n\u2202H\n=\n\u2202Ri\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n\u221e\n\n\u2202\n(S1 m1 m2 |e\u2212i(\u03b11 \u2212\u03b12 ) \u03c6\u2217 (r)\u03c6(r + R) + ei(\u03b11 \u2212\u03b12 ) \u03c6(r)\u03c6\u2217 (r + R)| +\n\u2202Ri\n+S2 |e\u2212i(\u03b11 \u2212\u03b12 ) \u2207\u03c6\u2217 (r)\u2207\u03c6(r + R) + ei(\u03b11 \u2212\u03b12 ) \u2207\u03c6(r)\u2207\u03c6\u2217 (r + R)|)d3 x.\n\n(126)\n\nIn the case of S1 6= S2 , the interference of unit-fields could be neither purely constructive nor purely destructive\ninterference. Respectively, the interaction of unit-fields would not be purely repulsive or purely attractive. Thus\nthe statistics would be different from the Fermi-Dirac or Bose-Einstein statistics. Some general properties of the\nenergy and force determining by Eqs. (123)-(126) can be derived without knowledge of the exact functions \u03c6(r) and\n\u03c6(r + R). In the limit R\u2192\u221e, the cross-correlation energy and force are equal to zero due to non-overlapping of the\nfields \u03c6(r) and \u03c6(r + R). The total energy (118) of the two unit-fields (particles), which can have the positive or\nnegative gradient of the cross-correlation energy for the different distances R, is equal to the Planck-Einstein energy\n\u03b5 = (k21 + m21 )1/2 + (k22 + m22 )1/2 at R\u2192\u221e. In the limit R\u21920, the energy (118) of the two particles depends on\nthe additive or subtractive character of the cross-correlation and the nature of the particles. Also note that the\nannihilation (pure destructive interference) of the particle and antiparticle yields the energy \u03b5 = 0. The energy of the\nparticles with repulsive forces tends to infinity.\nThe above-considered general properties and behaviors of the energy and force could be understand better by\nconsidering the one-dimensional (1-D in space) scalar unit-fields (bosons) with the two simplest forms of the function\n\u03c6(r), namely the static unit-fields with the functions [see, the illustrations in Figs.

(5) and (6), the energies have extreme values at the distance R \u2248 1. In the case of the\ncurves (2) and (4) of Figs. (5) and (6), the energies have maximum or minimum values at the distance R = 0. The\nbounded unit-field pare with the minimum energy at the distance R 6= \u221e could be considered as a composite particle.\nNote that the considerable energy-mass defect \u2206H = H \u2212 (H1 + H2 ) = H12 exists in such a case [see, the comments\nto Eq. (35)]. The calculations have been performed for the fields with the coupling parameter G=1. The field (127)\ncould be attributed to the one-dimensional gravitational field if the sign-coupling dimensionless constant SG is equal\nto the respective Newton constant of gravitation. If the field \u03c6(r) is associated with both the unit-mass m and unitcharge q, then the fields \u03c61 and \u03c62 are presented as \u03c61 (m, x) = \u03c61 (m, q, x) and \u03c62 (m, x) = \u03c62 (m, q, x). The energy\n(mass) of the composite one-dimensional field is described by Eq. (118), where the parameters should correspond to\nthe Planck-Einstein energy of two charged particles. That means the energy (119) is equal to the Planck-Einstein\nenergy H1 + H2 = m1 + m2 of the two charged, massive unit-fields (with the spin s = 0 or s 6= 0) at the rest in\nthe limit R \u2192 \u221e. The charges of the particles (as well as the particle spins) are attributed to the sign-coupling\nproduct SG \u2261 S\u03b3q1 q2 , which characterizes the sign and value of the gradient of the cross-correlation (interaction,\ncoupling) energy under interference of the two charged unit-waves [see, also comments to Eqs. (123) and (124)]. The\nunit-fields could be attributed to the one-dimensional Coulomb fields if the sign-coupling dimensionless constant is\nequal to the respective Coulomb constant. The pair of the unit-fields \u03c6(r) \u2261 \u03c6(x) = (m/2.6)\u22121/2 (1 + |x|)\u22121 e\u2212(1/2)|x|\nand \u03c6(r + R) \u2261 \u03c6(x \u2212 R) = (m/2.6)\u22121/2 (1 + |x \u2212 R|)\u22121 e\u2212(1/2)|x\u2212R| could be considered as the particle pairs, which\nexhibits the exponential law, with the strong or weak short-range interaction associated with the respective strong\nor weak force. The calculated energy and force of the composite field \u03c8(r) + \u03c8(r + R) is shown in Figs. (7) and\n(8). The calculated energy and force are compared with the energy \u03b5(R) = (m1 + m2 ) + SG(1 + |R|)\u22121 e\u2212(1/2)|R|\nand force \u2212\u2202\u03b5(R)/\u2202R, which correspond to the Yukawa-like potential energy and force. The calculations have been\nperformed for the coupling parameter G=1. The repulsive and attractive forces correspond to the signs S = +1 and\nS = \u22121, respectively. The force (111) rapidly decreases with increasing the distance R, |F (R)| \u223c |R|\u22121 e\u2212|R| . At the\ndistance less than approximately 1, the attractive and repulsive forces exchange the roles in the case of the curves\n(1) and (3) of Figs. (7) and (8).

The signs (S1 = S2 = \u22121) and (S1 = S2 = 1) correspond to the\ncurves (2) and (4), respectively.\n\nenergy at the distance R 6= \u221e could be considered as a composite particle. Note that the considerable energy-mass\ndefect \u2206H = H12 exists in such a case [see, also the comments to Eq. (35)]. The energy associated with the energymass defect is usually called the binding energy. The field (128) could be attributed to the one-dimensional Yukawa\nfield if the sign-coupling product is equal to the respective Yukawa constant. Respectively, the field (128) could be\nattributed to the strong or weak short-range interaction if the sign-coupling product SG is equal to the respective\nstrong or weak force. I have presented the computer results for the \"weak\" (127) and \"strong\" (128) boson scalar\nunit-fields. The results for the vector boson fields and fermion fields are similar to the boson scalar unit-fields. One\ncan easily compute the energy and force by using the presented model for the vector boson fields and the spinor fields,\nas well as for the composite fields composed from both the boson and spinor fields. It should be mentioned again\nthat the above-described bounded unit-field pair, the pair that has the minimum energy at the distance R 6= \u221e, is\nconsidered as a stable composite particle. To provide the stable state at the distance R = 0, the sign S1 = \u22121 of the\nproduct \u03c8(r)\u03c8(r + R) should not be different from the sign S2 = \u22121 of the product \u2207\u03c8(r)\u2207\u03c8(r + R). In the case of\nS1 = \u22121 and S2 = \u22121, the two-particle state (particle) is the degenerate state because the two unit-fields (particles)\nare indistinguishable, in any spacetime point. In other words, such a particle does not have any internal structure\n(substructure). The stable non-degenerate state (composite particle with measurable internal structure) is provided\nby the signs S1 = 1 and S2 = \u22121 at the distance 0 < R 6= \u221e.\nThe Einstein and traditional quantum-physics descriptions of the forces are equivalent from the point of view of the\npresent model of the particle interactions, which is based on the gradient of the cross-correlation energy connected with\nthe interference between unit-fields (particles). The difference between the models is in absence of the cross-correlation\nenergy mediated by the interference between particles in both the Einstein relativity and traditional quantum-physics\ntheories. In other words, the cross-correlation energy-mass associated with the cross-correlation (interference) of bodies\n(particles) does not exist in the Newton (classical) mechanics, Einstein relativity, quantum-mechanics and quantumfield theories. The interference-less behaviour of particles in these theories is provided by the spatial separation of\nthe massive point-like particles, which can not occupy the same spacetime point. Indeed, in the Newton mechanics\nand Einstein special relativity of the interference-less particles, the material point-like particles are always separated\nby the \"straight\" empty space. The material interference-free bodies are separated by the \"curve\" empty space in\nthe Einstein general relativity. The physical picture is more complicated in quantum mechanics and quantum field\ntheories, where the \"straight\" or \"curve\" empty space (vacuum) between the interference-less point particles (bosons\nor fermions) is full-filled by the virtual particles (gauge bosons). Although the bosons can occupy the same spacetime\npoint, the cross-correlation energy of the bosons in this point is equal to zero due to the Copenhagen-Dirac postulate.\n\n\f33\nThe identical fermions can not share the same spacetime point. Therefore the cross-correlation energy of the identical\nfermions in this point is equal to zero. The cross-correlation energy of non-identical fermions occupying the same\nspacetime point is equal to zero due to the Copenhagen-Dirac postulate. The non-zero cross-correlation energy induced\nby the interference between particles could give natural explanation of the invisible energy-mass, which in astrophysics\nand cosmology is usually called the \"dark\" energy-mass. Indeed, in order to account for the well-known discrepancies\nbetween measurements based on the mass of the visible matter in astronomy and cosmology and definitions of the\nenergy (mass) made through dynamical or general relativistic means, the present model does not need in hypothesizing\nthe existence of \"dark\" energy-mass. In the present model, the \"dark\" cosmological energy-mass as well as the wellknown spiral cosmological structures are attributed simply to the coherent cross-correlation energy-mass of the moving\ncosmological objects. For instance, the unit-fields (particles) of cosmological objects moving in the same direction\nwith the same velocity have the same moments kn = k. According to the present model [for more details, see Part\nII and Sec. (2) of Part I], the interference between the macroscopic bodies (fields) composed from the unit-fields\ndoes induce the cross-correlation energy-mass, which would be undetectable by emitted or scattered electromagnetic\nradiation in astronomical and cosmological observations. In this regard, note that an infinite unit-field (for instance,\n\u03c8(r) \u223c |r|\u22121 ) occupying the finite volume (V 6= \u221e) of the visible Universe is overlapped with the superposition\nof all other infinite unit-fields. The energy of such an infinite unit-field includes both the canonical energy of the\nsingle unit-field (particle) and the cross-correlation energy (\u03b5cc ) associated with the interference (cross-correlation)\nwith the superposition of all other infinite unit-fields, namely with the physical vacuum of the visible Universe. The\ncross-correlation energy in such a case may be considered as the energy of interaction of the unit-field (particle) with\nthe virtual particles of the physical vacuum of the visible Universe. Notice, in the case of homogeneous distribution of\nunit-fields (particles), the cross-correlation energy \u03b5cc \u2192 0 if the volume V \u2192 \u221e. Also note that the vacuum-particle\ncross-correlation energy, which is equal to zero for the constant velocity (v = const.) in inertial coordinate systems\nhaving the shift symmetry of time, increases per the time unit \u03b4t with the increase \u03b4v or \u03b4k of the velocity v or the\nmomentum k of the unit-field (particle) due to the interference (interaction) of the accelerating unit-field with the\nphysical vacuum. The increase \u03b4\u03b5cc of the cross-correlation (interaction) energy caused by the interference between\nthe accelerating unit-field and the physical vacuum could be interpreted as the mass increase, in agreement with\nthe Einstein special relativity relation m = m0 /(1 \u2212 v 2 /c2 )1/2 . That give, probably for the first time, a microscopic\nexplanation (physical interpretation) of this phenomenon. One should not confuse here the absolute (true) vacuum\nassociated with the \"straight\" geometry of the non-material spacetime field of the Einstein special relativity with\nthe physical (non-absolute) vacuum connected with the \"curve\" geometry of the non-material spacetime field of the\nEinstein general relativity. The energies of the \"straight\" spacetime (non-material absolute vacuum) of the Einstein\nspacial relativity and Newton mechanics are equal to zero, while the \"curve\", non-material, geometrical spacetime\n(mathematical object) of the Einstein general relativity has the non-zero values depending on the spatial distribution\nof masses. In the present model, the spacetime energy is equal to zero only if the non-material spacetime is not\noccupied by the material unit-fields (particles). In other words, the energy of an empty (non-material) spacetime of\nthe present model is equal to zero. Notice, the spacetime energy of the Universe occupied by the infinite unit-fields\ncontains both the energies of material unit-fields (particles) and the cross-correlation energy of interfering unit-fields.\nTherefore, the Universe occupied by the infinite unit-fields always has the non-zero value of the spacetime energy\nassociated with the cross-correlation of unit-fields. The spacetime not occupied by the finite unit-fields obeys the zero\nvalue of energy.\nThe above-presented analysis of the interactions of unit-fields has showed that the physical pictures of the non-zero\nenergies of the physical vacuum (spacetime) of the Einstein general relativity, the traditional quantum-field theory\nand the present model are formally identical. Nevertheless, from a point of view of the materialistic philosophy, the\nphysical (materialistic) interpretation of the non-zero spacetime energy of the physical vacuum in a volume occupied\nby the finite or infinite material unit-fields is more natural and transparent physically than the interpretations based\non the use of the Einstein field of non-material, geometrical, \"curve\" spacetime or the field of virtual (simultaneously\ncreated and destroyed) unobservable particles mediated by the perturbation mathematical approximations of the\ntraditional theory of quantum fields. For the non-materialistic explanation (interpretation) of the non-zero spacetime\nenergy of the physical vacuum in a finite volume one may use the non-material, \"curve\" spacetime field or the field\nof virtual (unobservable) particles assuming that such fields do exist in the volume without presence of the material\nparticles inside or outside this volume. Another example of the non-materialistic explanation (interpretation) of the\nnon-zero spacetime energy of the physical vacuum is the so-called String Theory, where the non-material spacetime\ncoordinates (covariant or non-covariant ones) mediate material properties of the non-material spacetime and give to\nthe spacetime the form of a non-virtual or virtual material particle (sring). In the same manner, the non-material\nwave-function of canonical quantum mechanics and the non-material wave of operators of traditional quantum field\ntheories, which are connected with a point-like material particle (a non-virtual or virtual one), give the material\n\n\f34\nproperties to this particle. Remember, the non-material wave-function and the non-material wave of operators are\nconventionally considered to be inseparable from the material point-like particle.\nThe general properties of the forces induced by the cross-correlation energy of the two interfering particles have been\nillustrated numerically by using the quasi-solutions of the 1-D Euler-Lagrange equation of motion having the form\nof the Klein-Gordon-Fock equation for the scalar-boson unit-field. One can easily follow the model for an arbitrary\nnumber of the vector-boson and fermion unit-fields having the arbitrary values of the rest masses (mn \u2261 m0n ), charges\n(qn \u2261 q0n ) and spins (sn \u2261 s0n ) of the unit-fields (particles). The fields of different kinds, generally speaking, may\ncross-correlate or not cross-correlate with each other. For instance, the electron and photon fields do cross-correlate\n(interact) with each other. The gravitational (mass-induced) field also does cross-correlate (interact) with the chargeinduced EM field of photons. In other words, the gravitational field deflects photons. The cross-correlation of the\ndifferent fields will be considered in details in Part II of the present study. It should be also mentioned that a tiny\nattractive force between closely placed metal plates in the Casimir effect, which according to Hendrik B. G. Casimir\nand Dirk Polder is due to the van der Waals force between polarizable molecules of the metallic plates [26], is attributed\nin the present model to the cross-correlation energy of the plates. The cross-correlation energy could be reinterpreted\nas the zero-point energy (vacuum energy) associated with the virtual exchange of particles of the quantum fields\nassociated with the molecules in the traditional quantum physics. The gradient of the cross-correlation energy falls\noff rapidly with the distance [see, Figs. (5)-(8)]. Therefore the force has a measurable value only when the distance\nbetween plates is extremely small.\n4. THE NON-ZERO CROSS-CORRELATION ENERGY MEDIATED BY INTERFERENCE\n\nPhysical phenomena involving the interference (cross-correlation) of classical or quantum finite-fields would be\naffected by the interference between particles if the cross-correlation energy of the fields does not equal to zero. Before\nconsidering the conditions of the non-zero cross-correlation energy let me briefly show how the cross-correlation model\npresented in Secs. (2) and (3) addresses the principal questions of Sec. (1), which have not been explained by the\nquantum mechanics and particle field theory based on the Copenhagen-Dirac interpretation of quantum interference.\n4.1. The present model versus the canonical interpretation of quantum interference\n\nIn the canonical quantum mechanics and quantum field theory based on the Copenhagen-Dirac postulate of \"interference-less\", self-interfering particles, the wave-functions \u03c8n (r, t) of particles are not additive\nPN\n[\u03c8(r, t)6= n=1 \u03c8n (r, t)] due to the non-additivity of the probability amplitudes (the probabilities of quantum alternatives are not additive). In other words, the particles do not interfere with each other. The interference (crosscorrelation) between particles or antiparticles in these theories never occurs in agreement with the Copenhagen-Dirac\npostulate because of the gauge symmetry of the mathematically constructed (engineered) Hamiltonians under the\n\u2032\nU (1) local gauge transformation (\u03c80n \u2192 \u03c80n\n= ei\u03b1n \u03c80n ). The absence of both the interference between particles and\nthe respective cross-correlation energy is provided by the U (1) gauge symmetry of the Hamiltonians constructed to\nbe independent from the phases \u03b1n . In the present model, both the non-quantum and quantum (operator) fields are\nmodelled as superpositions of the interfering unified-fields. The Hamiltonians of such non-quantum and quantum fields\nare not invariant under the U (1) local gauge transformation given rise to the interference between the non-quantum\nor quantum fields and the dependence of the Hamiltonians (energies) on the field phases. Naturally, the dependence\nof energy on the unit-field phases could determine the uncertainty of energy, for instance, in the tunnelling process\nof any kind involving the phase uncertainty (\"hidden\" parameter). The general correspondence principle says that\nthe quantum and classical treatments must be in agreement not only for a very large number of particles. In the\npresent model, the non-quantum and quantum (operator) treatments are in agreement for an arbitrary number of\nparticles (unit-fields). The Copenhagen interpretation (philosophy) of the de Broglie wave associated with a particle\nas the wave of probability presents a more or less intuitively transparent background for the physical interpretation\nof quantum mechanics. However, the Copenhagen interpretation of the de Broglie wave using the pure mathematical\nobject (probability) did not solve really the problem of physical interpretation of quantum mechanics. The probability\nor the wave of probability is not a real physical matter. In particle field theory, up to now, the physical interpretation of the wave (field) of operators does not exist. An operator is considered rather as a pure mathematical object\nthan a real material substance. Note, in this connection, that the problem of physical (materialistic) interpretation\nassociated with the concept of probability does not exist in the Newton and Einstein mechanics. For an example,\nthe real propagation of material particles in a gas is associated with the real mass, speed and kinetic energy. Each\n\n\f35\nparticle of the gas has the real (concrete, particular) speed and kinetic energy that can be equal or not to the pure\nmathematical counterparts, the average or expected values. In other words, the every particle of the gas propagates\nrather with a concrete (specific) speed than with the average or expected velocity. The average (expected) speed and\nthe respective kinetic energy are the pure mathematical objects calculated by using the probability (pure mathematical object) associated with other pure mathematical objects, the Bose-Einstein and Fermi-Dirac statistics. In the\npresent model, the unit-wave associated with a boson or fermion particle, unlike the non-material wave of probability\nor operators connected with a material point-like particle in quantum mechanics or particle field theory, is a real, finite\nunit-wave (unit-field) of the matter (mass-energy) with the Bose-Einstein or Fermi-Dirac cross-correlation properties.\nThe Copenhagen-Dirac interpretation of quantum interference does strictly exclude existence of the particle interference and cross-correlation energy. The interference between bodies (particles) and the respective cross-correlation\nenergy do not exist also in the Einstein general relativity. The classical wave physics and the present model do use\nthe interference and cross-correlation energy in description of the pure additive or subtractive interference. For both\nthe classical and quantum (operator) fields, in the present model, the two-times increase of the wave amplitude does\nincrease the wave energy in four times, and the wave with zero amplitude has zero energy. The quantum field energy\ncalculated by using the present model is equal to the classical value. In order to account for the well-known discrepancies between measurements based on the mass of the visible matter in astronomy and cosmology and definitions of\nthe mass made through dynamical or general relativistic means, the present model does not need in a hypothesis of\nthe existence of \"dark\" energy-mass. In the present model, the \"dark\" cosmological energy-mass as well as the wellknown spiral cosmological structures are attributed to the cross-correlation energy-mass of the moving and interfering\ncosmological objects (particles). In particle field theory, the particle energy \u03b50 = \u03c90 + (1/2)\u03c90 is different from the\nPlanck-Einstein particle energy \u03b50 = \u03c90 = (k20 + m20 )1/2 [1, 2]. The quantum energy \u03b50 = (1/2)\u03c90 , which is identified\nas the vacuum energy associated with the particle, does contradict both the Einstein theory and classical physics of\nthe empty space. In the present model, both the non-quantum and quantum energies of a particle are equal to the\nPlanck-Einstein particle energy \u03b50 = \u03c90 = (k20 + m20 )1/2 . The positive energy-mass \u03b50 = (k20 + m20 )1/2 of antiparticles\nin the present model is different from the negative energy-mass of the Dirac antiparticles satisfying the energy-mass\nrelation \u03b50 = \u2212(k20 + m20 )1/2 . In the present model, the non-quantum and quantum energies of the empty spacetime\n(true vacuum) are identified as the Newton-Planck-Einstein vacuum energy \u03b5vac = 0 of the empty straight-spacetime\n(absolute vacuum). In quantum theories of particle physics, the forces acting upon a particle are seen as the action\nof the respective gauge-boson (material) field that is present at the particle location. In perturbative particle field\ntheory, the forces are attributed to the exchange of the field virtual particles (material gauge-bosons). Such a model\nis inconsistent with the Einstein theory of general relativity, where the gravitational interaction between two massive\nobjects (particles) is not viewed as a force, but rather, objects moving freely in non-material gravitational fields travel\nunder their own inertia in straight lines through non-material \"curve\" spacetime [5]. From the point of view of the\npresent model of the particle interactions, which is based on the gradient (\"spatial curvature\") of the cross-correlation\nenergy of the interfering particles (material unit-fields), the Einstein and quantum descriptions (interpretations) of the\nforces are formally equivalent. One could mention also the problem associated with the nonconservation of the number\nof particles and energy in perturbative particle field theory based on the Copenhagen-Dirac postulate of \"interferencefree\", self-interfering particles. The renormalization procedures do solve the problem, but not for a general case [6\u20139].\nIn the present model, such a kind of the problems can be solved in a general form without the use of the particular\nrenormalization procedures of the traditional quantum field theories (see, the calculations of energies and forces in\nSec. (3) and Part II). To this end, the superluminal signaling in quantum mechanics (the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen\nparadox), which is associated with the J.S. Bell inequalities [11], does contradict the Einstein special relativity. The\ndiscussion of the problem associated with the superluminal signalling in quantum mechanics and particle field theory\nwill be presented in Sec. (5).\n4.2. Conditions of the non-zero cross-correlation energy\n\nAny physical phenomenon involving interference (cross-correlation) of the classical or quantum fields would be\naffected by the interference between particles if the cross-correlation energy of the interfering particles (unit-fields)\ndoes not equal to zero. In the present model, there is an uncertainty of the energy and moment of the interfering unitwaves (particles) due to the phase-dependent energy (momentum) of the superposition of unit-fields. This uncertainty,\nhowever, should not be confused with the mathematical uncertainty of the energy and momentum attributing to the\nuncertainty principle [22, 23] for the single particle. In quantum mechanics, lack of commutation of the time derivative\noperator with the time operator itself formally (mathematically) results into an uncertainty principle for time and\nenergy: the longer the period of time, the more precisely energy can be defined. In addition, the non-commutation of\n\n\f36\nthe momentum operator with the coordinate operator mathematically results into the Heisenberg position-momentum\nuncertainty\n\u2206x\u2206k \u2265 1/2,\n\n(129)\n\nwhich means it is impossible mathematically to determine simultaneously both the position and momentum of a\nparticle with any great degree of accuracy. In quantum mechanics, the physical mechanism behind the positionmomentum uncertainty is attributed to the \"compression\" of the de Broglie wave \u03c80 (r, t) of a particle. According to\nthe Copenhagen (canonical) interpretation of quantum mechanics, the probability amplitude attributed to the nonmaterial wave-function \u03c80 (r, t) of a material particle determines the probability to find the single particle at the time\nt and position r. The value \u03c80\u2217 (r, t)\u03c80 (r, t) is interpreted as the probability density. To obtain an accurate reading of\nthe position of a particle, the mathematical non-material objects (wave-function and probability) associated with the\nparticle must be \"compressed\" as much as possible by the material boundaries of other, usually macroscopic, material\nobjects. That means that the non-material wave of probability must be made up of increasing numbers of mathematical\nsine waves added together in the Fourier decomposition of the de Broglie wave. The momentum of the particle is\nproportional to the wavelength of one of the non-material sine waves, but it could be any of them. Thus a more precise\nposition measurement by adding together more non-material sine waves means the momentum measurement becomes\nless precise (and vice versa). The considered mathematical interpretation sometimes is mentioned incorrectly as the\nphysical one. Indeed, the non-material wave-function of a material particle could not be physically compressed by\nthe material boundaries. Moreover, the particle (wave-function) could not be physically compressed by the particles\n(wave-functions) of material boundaries, because a particle interferes (interacts) in canonical quantum mechanics only\nwith itself.\nIn the present model, there are uncertainties of the position-momentum of both the single unit-field (particle) and\nthe superposition of N unit-fields (particles). The interpretation of the position-momentum uncertainty of the single\nunit-field (particle) is different from the above-presented mathematical interpretation of quantum mechanics. For the\nsake of simplicity, let me consider a scalar boson. The energy of a scalar boson (material unit-field) depends on the\nunit-field \u03c80 and the spatial \"curvature\" \u2207\u03c80 of the unit-field in the Hamiltonian density (2). The unit-field function\nis determined mathematically by the Euler-Lagrange equation of motion with the initial and boundary conditions\nimposed. The energy of the free unit-field (16) is equal to the Planck-Einstein particle energy \u03b5 = (k2 + m2 )1/2 [see,\n(15)]. The momentum k of the free particle (material unit-field) located infinitely far from the material boundaries can\nhave an arbitrary value. The value depends solely on the unit-field gradient (\"curvature\") \u2207\u03c80 . The localization of the\nmaterial unit-field \u03c80 (x) by the material boundaries in the region \u2206x = x2 \u2212 x1 means physically and mathematically\nthat the real parts of the fields must vanish on the boundaries, Re[\u03c8(x1 )] = Re[\u03c8(x2 )] = 0. The physical interaction\nof the unit-field with the boundaries results into selection of the unit-field with the spatial \"curvature\" determining by\n\u2217\n\u2217\nthe condition \u2207\u03c80 (x) \u2207\u03c80 (x) = k 2 \u2207\u03c80 (x) \u2207\u03c80 (x), where k = n\u03c0/\u2206x (n=0,1, 2, ...) and \u2206k = \u2206kmin = \u03c0/\u2206x. If\nthe value n of the unit-field is unknown, then these relations can be presented as the position-momentum uncertainty\n\u2206x\u2206k \u2265 \u03c0,\n\n(130)\n\nwhich is similar to the Heisenberg uncertainty (129). The relation (130) can be rewritten for the energy by using the\nPlanck-Einstein particle energy as\n\u2206x\u2206[\u03b52 \u2212 m2 ]1/2 \u2265 \u03c0.\n\n(131)\n\nThe physical mechanism behind the uncertainties (130) and (131) could be attributed to the increase of the spatial\n\"curvature\" (gradient) \u2207\u03c80 (x) of the real material unit-field by interference (interaction) of the material unit-field\n\u03c80 (x) with the particles of material boundaries of macroscopic objects. That is to say that the uncertainties are due\nto the physical interaction (interference) of the particle (material unit-field) with the particles (material unit-fields) of\nthe external material boundaries. Such a physical interpretation of the uncertainties, the increase of the \"curvature\"\n(gradient) of the material unit-field by the particles of the external boundaries under the spatial localization of the\nunit-field (particle), is different from the mathematical interpretation based on the \"physical compression\" of the pure\nmathematical objects (wave-function and probability) connected with with a material particle. Remember, a particle\nphysically interferes (interacts) in canonical quantum mechanics only with itself. It should be stressed that Eqs.\n(130) and (131) should be used for the particle (unit-field) and not for the empty \"straight\" space (Newton-Einstein\nvacuum) with k = \u03b5 = m = 0. Equations (130) and (131) could be generalized for the N unit-waves (particles)\nlocalized in the region \u2206x by using Eqs. (20) and (34). If the unit-waves have the same phases, then Eqs. (20), (34),\n(130), and (131) yielded\n\u2206x\u2206k \u2265 \u03c0N 2\n\n(132)\n\n\f37\nand\n\u2206x\u2206[\u03b52 \u2212 m2 ]1/2 \u2265 \u03c0N 2 .\n\n(133)\n\nIf the phases are unknown, then Eqs. (132) and (133) could be rewritten as\n\u2206x\u2206k \u2265 0\n\n(134)\n\n\u2206x\u2206[\u03b52 \u2212 m2 ]1/2 \u2265 0.\n\n(135)\n\nand\n\nIn such a case, the boundaries do determine the \"curvatures\" \u2207\u03c80n of the unit-fields \u03c80n , but not select the energy and\nmomentum of the unit-field superposition due to the phase uncertainty. The energy and momentum are determined\nrather by the cross-correlation of the unit-fields than by the interaction of the fields with the boundaries. In order\nto derive the energy-time uncertainty, one should consider the unit-field \u03c80 (x, t) = \u03c80 (x)\u03c80 (t) of the matter and the\nlocalization of the field \u03c80 (t) in the time interval \u2206t = t2 \u2212 t1 . The energy \u03b5 of the field \u03c80 (x, t) depends on the field\ntemporal \"curvature\" \u2202\u03c80 /\u2202t [see, Eq. (2)]. The localization of the unit-field \u03c80 (t) in the time interval \u2206t = t2 \u2212 t1\nmeans mathematically that the real parts of the fields must vanish on the time boundaries, Re[\u03c80 (t1 )] = Re[\u03c80 (t2 )] =\n0. The time-boundary condition enforces the unit-field to have the temporal \"curvature\" determining by the condition\n[\u2202\u03c80 \u2217 /\u2202t][\u2202\u03c80 /\u2202t] = \u03b52 [\u2202\u03c80 \u2217 /\u2202t][\u2202\u03c80 /\u2202t], where \u03b5 = n\u03c0/\u2206t (n=1, 2, ...) and \u2206\u03b5 = \u2206\u03b5min = \u03c0/\u2206t. If the value n is\nunknown, then these relations can be presented as the energy-time uncertainty\n\u2206\u03b5\u2206t \u2265 \u03c0.\n\n(136)\n\nThe energy-time uncertainty (136) is caused by the increase of the temporal \"curvature\" \u2202\u03c80 (t)/\u2202t of the real unitfield \u03c80 (t) of the matter (mass-energy) with decreasing the localization interval \u2206t. Such a physical interpretation\nof the time-energy uncertainty is different from the traditional interpretations of quantum mechanics. Note that the\nabove-presented analysis is applicable for the particles of another kind. For instance, one can easily rewrite Eqs.\n(130)-(136) for other boson or fermion unit-fields (particles). In the context of the above-presented interpretations\nof the uncertainties, one could mention again that the Copenhagen interpretation of the de Broglie wave associated with a particle as the wave of probability presents a more or less intuitively transparent background for the\nphysical interpretation of the quantum mechanics. The Copenhagen interpretation of the de Broglie wave using the\npure mathematical object (probability), however, does not solve really the problem of physical interpretation of the\nHeisenberg position-momentum and time-energy uncertainties. The wave of probability is not a real physical matter\n(mass-energy), which can be \"compressed\" by the physical (material) boundaries in some incorrect interpretations\nof the canonical quantum mechanics. The particle field theory, up to now, does not give any physical interpretation\nof the wave (field) of operators. Indeed, an operator should be considered rather as a mathematical object than a\nreal physical matter. Naturally, the spatial and/or temporal \"compression\" of the mathematical object (probability\nor operator) would not have any physical meaning. In the present model, the unit-wave associated with a boson or\nfermion particle, unlike the wave of probability or operators in quantum mechanics or particle field theory, is a real finite unit-wave (unit-field) of the matter (mass-energy), whose \"curvature\" (gradient) can be changed spatially and/or\ntemporally. The physical mechanism behind the position-momentum and time-energy uncertainties is attributed to\nthe increase of the spatial (\u2207\u03c80 ) and/or temporal (\u2202\u03c80 /\u2202t) \"curvatures\" (gradients) of a real unit-field of the matter\nunder the spatial or temporal localization of the unit-field by interaction with other microscopical or macroscopic\nobjects. It can be mentioned that the position-time (spacetime) uncertainty is discussed in Ref. [24](e).\nIt should be stressed again that any physical phenomenon involving the interference (cross-correlation) of the boson\nand/or fermion fields (particles) would be affected by the field interference if the respective cross-correlation energy\nis not equal to zero. The static unit-fields (\u2202\u03c80n (r, t)/\u2202t = 0) have been considered in Sec. (3). It has been shown as\nan example that the cross-correlation energy of the static boson scalar fields does not equal to zero at the distance\nR \u2264 Rc , where Rc \u2248 102 and Rc \u2248 5 for the weak and strong unit-fields, respectively. The cross-correlation energies\nof the transient boson fields (waves), such as the non-quantum finite waves composed from the non-quantum boson\nunit-waves, are described by the cross-correlation terms in Eqs. (12) and (19). The second quantization of the nonquantum finite-waves by replacing the waves (fields) by the field operators has yielded the quantum cross-correlation\nenergy (65). The non-quantum and quantum cross-correlation energies in Eqs. (12), (19), and (65) are equal to\neach other. The time-dependent cross-correlation energy of the wave-like fields composed from the boson unit-waves\nand/or the fermion unit-waves [see, Sec. (2)] is proportional to the terms\nZ\n1\n[e\u2212i(\u2206k0nm r\u2212\u2206\u03b50nm t\u2212\u2206\u03b1nm ) + ei(\u2206k0nm r\u2212\u2206\u03b50nm t\u2212\u2206\u03b1nm ) ]d3 x,\n(137)\nVnm Vnm\n\n\f38\nwhich have the non-negligible values in the case of\nk0n \u2192 k0m\n\n(138)\n\n(remember, \u03b50n \u2192 \u03b50m if k0n \u2192 k0m and m0n = m0m ) and/or in the case of\nVnm (kxn \u2212 kxm )(kyn \u2212 kym )(kzn \u2212 kzm ) \u2192 0,\n\n(139)\n\nwhere kn \u2261 k0n , km \u2261 k0m and kn 6= km . Notice, in the case of kn 6= km and Vnm > (kxn \u2212 kxm )(kyn \u2212\nkym )(kzn \u2212 kzm ), the terms (137) are equal to zero if the unit-waves are confined by the resonator-like boundaries. The experimental realization of the condition (138) is extremely difficult (see, Ref. [24](a-c)). The creation\nof the unit-fields with the momentums kn \u2192 km and kn = km will be considered in details in the following section devoted to the Bose-Einstein condensation, super-radiation, Bosenova effect, superfluidity, superconductivity,\nsupermagnetism, and quantum anomalous and fractional Hall effects. In the case of the ordinary physical systems, which are not associated with physical super-properties, the cross-correlation energy is equal to zero due\nto the conditions kn 6= km and/or Vnm >> 1/(kxn \u2212 kxm )(kyn \u2212 kym )(kzn \u2212 kzm ). While, the sub-wavelength\n[Vnm << 1/(kxn \u2212 kxm )(kyn \u2212 kym )(kzn \u2212 kzm )] systems obey the non-zero cross-correlation energy. The case (139)\ncorresponds to the pure constructive or destructive interference in the sub-wavelength volume. For instance, the\nphysical super-properties of the sub-wavelength systems could be attributed to the cross-correlation energy in the\nnear-field diffraction (scattering) of waves, as well as in the tunnelling effects and virtual-particle phenomena of any\nkind (for instance, in quantum-mechanics tunnelling, wave-mechanical tunnelling, evanescent wave coupling, forces\nor effects by virtual particles, and Casimir effect). Note, in this regard, that the classical-mechanics particles that\ndo not have enough energy to classically surmount a barrier will not be able to reach the other side. In canonical\nquantum mechanics, the particles with an arbitrary small energy always have the non-zero probability to overcame\nthe energy barrier of any value. Although the probability of tunnelling decreases for taller and wider barriers, the\nparticles would surmount the all potential barriers after a some time leading to decay of the all-known composite\nparticles (nucleus, atoms and molecules). In contrast to the tunnelling and virtual processes of the canonical quantum\nmechanics and particle field theory, which may involve the infinite energy connected with the Heisenberg uncertainty\nprinciple, the realization (reality) of such physical phenomena in the present model is strictly limited by the finite\nvalue of the cross-correlation energy. If the cross-correlation energy is smaller than the potential barrier, then the\nunit-fields will never surmount the energy barrier. Although the unit-field may occupy a small volume outside the\nbarrier, the main part of the unit-field should be always inside the barrier. Naturally, the evanescent part of the\nunit-field may overlap (interact) with the unit-fields that occupy the external space of the potential barrier. It could\nbe also noted again that the spatially infinite fields are overlapped in the infinite volume. Unlike the fields occupying\nthe infinite volume, the interference of the finite fields requires the creation of conditions of the field overlapping. In\norder to interfere, the finite fields or their parts should occupy (share) the same volume Vnm at the same time moment\ntnm = tn = tm . The cross-correlation energy decreases if the volume Vnm decreases, for instance, due to the movement\nof unit-fields (particles) away from each other. One should not confuse vanishing the cross-correlation energy by the\nnon-overlapping of the finite fields with the case of the overlapped \"orthogonal fields\" [see, Sec. (2)]. For instance, the\ncross-correlation energies of the two unit-fields (particles) before and after a collision (interference) are equal to zero\ndue to the non-overlapping of the unit-fields. During the elastic collision (interaction) of the unit-fields, the vanishing\nof the cross-correlation energy is caused by the orthogonality of the unit-fields (k0n 6= k0m ) in the Hilbert space.\nSuch a process could be considered as an elastic collision of the particles. In the case of the non-orthogonal unit-fields\n[see, Secs. (2) and (3)], the cross-correlation (interference) of the unit-waves can lead to the non-elastic collision. For\ninstance, the Raman or another nonlinear scattering of a photon by an atom (composite boson-like particle) should\nbe considered as the non-elastic collision. So far the conditions of the non-zero cross-correlation energy have been\nanalyzed for the unit-waves that have the permanent (constant) phases. In the general case, the phases may have the\ntime-dependent values \u03b1n = \u03b1n (t) and \u03b1m = \u03b1m (t). The cross-correlation energy averaged over the time interval \u2206t\ncould be considered as the time-independent energy hHi\u2206t of the interfering unit-waves:\nhHi\u2206t\n\n1\n=\n\u2206t\n\nZ\n\nZ\n\n\u2206t 0\n\n\u221e\n\n3\n\nhhid xdt =\n\nN\nX\n\nn=1\n\nHnn +\n\n2\nNX\n\u2212N\n\nn6=m\n\nhHnm i\u2206t ,\n\n(140)\n\nwhere the self-correlation energy hHnn i\u2206t = Hnn is a time-independent value, and the time-averaged (\"timeindependent\") cross-correlation energy is given by\n2\nNX\n\u2212N\n\nn6=m\n\nhHnm i\u2206t =\n\n2\nNX\n\u2212N\n\nn6=m\n\n1\n\u2206t\n\nZ\n\nZ\n\n\u2206t 0\n\n\u221e\n\nhhnm id3 xdt.\n\n(141)\n\n\f39\nIn the case of the incoherent unit-fields having absolutely random phases, both the term (137) averaged over any time\n\u2206t and the respective energy (141) are equal to zero due to the non-correlation of such fields. Naturally, the increase\nof the degree of coherence (phase correlation) increases the time-averaged cross-correlation energy of the partially\ncoherent unit-fields. Notice, the cross-correlation energy (141) averaged over the time \u2206t >> 1/\u2206\u03b50nm does vanish\nif the coherent unit-fields (particles) with the constant phases \u03b1n and \u03b1m are distinguishable (k0n 6= k0m and/or\nm0n 6= m0m , respectively \u03b50n 6= \u03b50m ). The property explains physically which particles are identical or non-identical.\nThe coherency of the identical (k0n = k0m and m0n = m0m , respectively \u03b50n = \u03b50m ) unit-fields (particles) should be\nconsidered as the necessary condition of existence of the cross-correlation energy. One should not confuse here the\ncoherency and cross-correlation of the two fields in the same [(P, t) = (P1 , t1 ) = (P2 , t2 )] spacetime points, which is\nrelated to the cross-correlation energy, with the coherency associated with the cross-correlation between the fields in\nthe different [(P1 , t1 ) 6= (P2 , t2 )] spacetime points of the amplitude or intensity interferometry.\n4.3. Quantum coherence and correlation\n\nThe basic properties of both the classical and quantum coherence are usually clarified in the context of the Young\ndouble-slit experiment [Sec. (1)]. Let me briefly describe the coherence properties in the frame of quantum mechanics\nand compare them with the present model. In quantum mechanics, the dynamics of quantum particles in the doubleslit experiment describes the relationship between the classical waves and quantum particles. The quantum particle\nis described by a wave-function associated with the wave of probability, which contains all the information about the\nstate of the quantum system. According to the Copenhagen-Dirac interpretation of quantum interference each particle\ninterferes only with itself. In the Young experiment, each particle can go through either slit and hence has two paths\nthat it can take to a particular final position (P, t). In quantum mechanics, these two paths interfere. If there is pure\ndestructive interference, the particle never arrives at that particular position. In quantum mechanics the ability of a\nparticle to interfere with itself is called quantum coherence. The quantum description of perfectly coherent paths is\ncalled a pure state, in which the two paths (wave-functions) are combined in a superposition. The correlation between\nthe two wave-functions exceeds what would be predicted for classical correlation between the two wave-functions (see,\nthe Bell inequalities [11]). It should be noted in this regard that the generally accepted wave-function of a particle\n(for instance, a photon) associated with the wave of probability does not exist in particle field theory. Therefore,\nstrictly speaking, the particle field theory could not consider the quantum (probabilistic) interference phenomena in\nthe Young double-slit experiment. In addition, in contrast with the Copenhagen-Dirac postulate of the \"interferenceless\" particles, the particle of quantum field theories interferes (interacts) with the particles of the slits due to the\nboundary conditions. If the quantum mechanical system of the above-mentioned two wave-functions (or any system\nof wave-functions of entangled particles in quantum mechanics) is decohered, which would occur, for instance, in a\nmeasurement via eigenselection, then there is no longer any phase relationship (correlation) between the two states.\nThe quantum description of imperfectly coherent (partially coherent) paths is called a mixed state, described by a\ndensity matrix and is analogous to a classical system of mixed probabilities, where the correlations are classical. One\nshould not confuse here the self-interference of the wave of operators associated with a particle in particle field theory\nwith the self-interference of the wave of probability associated with the above-mentioned wave-functions of a particle\nin the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics. The wave of operators associated with a particle is not\nattributed to the probability amplitude of the wave of probability associated with the wave-function of the particle.\nUnlike in quantum mechanics, in particle field theory the generally accepted wave-function of a particle (antiparticle)\ndoes not exist up to now. Therefore the interference mechanism behind the self-interference properties (Dirac's oneparticle self-interference) of a particle in particle field theory should be attributed rather to the mathematical properties\nof the wave of operators than the wave of probability of quantum mechanics. It should be stressed again that the\nparticle should interfere only with itself in the Young experiment according to the Copenhagen-Dirac interpretation of\nquantum interference. However, that contradict the fact that the particle interferes (interacts) also with the particles\nof the slits due to the boundary conditions imposed by the slits given rise to the \"hidden\" interference between particles.\nIn the present model, the coherence properties of the unit-waves (particles) in the Young experiment are similar to\nthe aforementioned quantum mechanical properties. The difference between the two models is in the interpretation of\nthe interference phenomenon and in the absence of the interference between particles and the cross-correlation energy\nin the quantum mechanical model based on the canonical interpretation of quantum interference. The present model\nconsiders a quantum particle as an indivisible unit-field (unit-wave) of the matter (mass-energy). The dynamics of the\nunit-wave is described by the Euler-Lagrange equation of motion with the initial and boundary conditions imposed.\nThe energy of the field, which depends on the spatial (\u2207\u03c80 ) and temporal (\u2202\u03c8 0 /\u2202t) \"curvatures\" of the field, is\ngiven by the Hamiltonian of the system. The spatial and temporal \"curvatures\" of the unit-wave can be changed\n\n\f40\nby the interference (interaction) of the unit-field with the particles (unit-fields) of boundaries of other microscopic\nor macroscopic objects, but the unit-field cannot be divided into the different independent parts. In the Young\nexperiment, the indivisibility of the unit-field (unit-wave) means the unit-field passing though the double slit is not\ndivided by the slits into two different independent fields (waves). The spatial and temporal \"curvatures\" and the shape\nof the unit-wave are changed by interaction (interference) of the unit-field with the unit-fields of the boundaries (slits),\nbut the unit-field is not divided into the independent parts (unit-waves). The collision (interaction) of the unit-field\n(for instance, photon) with the slits is elastic, linear process. Therefore the energy of the unit-field is conserved.\nNotice, the particle (photon) and the respective energy can be divided into the independent parts in the case of the\nnonlinear processes (inelastic collisions), only. In the Young experiment, the interaction of the unit-field with the slits\ndoes result into reshaping of the unit-field in the transverse and longitudinal directions. The interference pattern on\nthe observation screen is produced by the interference of the two parts of the same unit-field (photon), which has been\nreshaped by the slits before the interference on the observation screen. That is to say that the interference pattern is\nformed on the slits by the change of the shape and spatial \"curvature\" of the unit-wave by the interaction of the unitfield with the slits. This mechanism can be represented as interference of the unit-field with itself on the observation\nscreen. The interaction of the unit-field with any additional object after the interaction with the slits would change\nthe spatial \"curvature\", shape and phase of the unit-wave and destroy the interference pattern. In such a case, the\nunit-field is decohered by the additional interaction process. The described mechanism of the self-interference is similar\nto that in the classical description of the Young experiment. The presented mechanism, however, does not require\nthe formation of two independent waves. The two parts of the reshaped unit-wave (photon) could interfere on the\nobservation screen like the two independent coherent waves in the classical model of the Young experiment. One should\nnot confuse here the one-particle self-interference of the wave of probability, which is associated with the single particle\n(photon) in the canonical interpretation of quantum mechanics, with the transverse and longitudinal reshaping of the\nreal indivisible unit-wave (photon) by the slits. In the present model, the reshaped unit-wave (particle) can interfere\nwith itself, as well with other coherent unit-waves (photons). That provides a simple, non-probabilistic explanation\nof the famous paradox of canonical quantum mechanics associated with the non-classical properties of the quantum\nmacroscopic system, namely the Schr\u00f6dinger's cat thought experiment. It should be also noted that a wave-function of\nthe entangled (strongly correlated) particles is considered in the present model rather as an indivisible unit-field than\na wave-function of a few-body quantum system of independent unit-waves (particles). In other words, the entangled\nparticles are considered as the parts of the same indivisible unit-wave reshaped in the transverse and/or longitudinal\ndirection into the entangled parts. Respectively, the parts of the same indivisible unit-wave reshaped in the transverse\nand/or longitudinal direction are considered as the entangled particles. As a consequence of the indivisibility of the\nreshaped unit-wave, which is composed from the entangled parts (\"entangled particles\"), the interference properties\nof the quantum wave of strongly correlated (entangled) particles are similar to that of an ordinary (non-composite)\nunit-wave. If the correlation (cross-correlation) between the different parts of the field reshaped in a liner or nonlinear\nprocess is very weak then the parts of the composite wave could be considered as independent unit-waves (particles).\nThe unit-wave (particle) could interfere not only with itself, but also with another coherent unit-wave. The interference (cross-correlation) of the two unit-waves can result into creation of the positive or negative cross-correlation\nenergy, which does increase or decrease the energy of the unit-field pair [see, Secs. (2)-(4)]. It is interesting that\nthe cross-correlation of two unit-waves in the conventional Young setup does not affect the energy of the unit-field\npair. Indeed, in the conventional Young double-slit experiment the two coherent unit-waves produced by the two slits\nseparated by the distance \u039b \u226b 2\u03c0/k0 are orthogonal in the far-field diffraction zone because of the different momentums (k01 /k01 6= k02 /k02 , k01 = k02 = k0 ). According to the expression (137), the cross correlation term (energy) of\nthe orthogonal unit-waves vanishes. Respectively, the field energy is given by \u03b5 = 2k0 . The situation is completely\ndifferent in the case of Young's subwavelength system, where \u039b \u226a 2\u03c0/k0 and correspondingly k01 /k01 = k02 /k02 and\nk01 = k02 = k0 . In the case of \u03b11 \u2212 \u03b12 = 0, the interference creates the extra energy, \u03b5 = 4k. In Refs. [24](a) and (c),\nthis phenomenon has been described and interpreted as a classical analog of the Dicke quantum superradiance [25]\nof a subwavelength ensemble of excited atoms. The interference completely destroys the energy (\u03b5 = 0) at the phase\ncondition \u03b11 \u2212 \u03b12 = \u03c0. A simple analysis of the Hamiltonians (12), (19) and (63) shows that the addition of waves is\nnot so efficient at larger spacing of the slits (\u039b \u223c 2\u03c0/k0 ), but still leads to the interference-induced enhancements and\nresonances (versus wavelength) in the total energy emitted by the slits. In such a case the field energy [0 \u2264 \u03b50 \u2264 4k0 ]\ndepends on the values k01 , k02 , \u03b11 , \u03b12 and \u039b (for more details, see the study [24](a-c) and references therein). In\nthe case of the Young's two-source system that consists of the two sub-wavelength (\u039b \u223c 2\u03c0/k0 ) dipole radiators, the\ndependence is especially simple. One should simply consider the radiation of the two almost identical dipoles in the\nnear-field zone or far-field zone. For instance the total time-averaged radiated power W of the two classical dipoles\nseparated by the distance \u039b \u226a 2\u03c0/k0 is given by W = (4\u03c9 4 /3)|d01 + d02 |2 \u2248 4W01 , where W01 \u2248 (4\u03c90 4 /3)|d01 |2 is the\npower of the first radiator with the dipole d01 \u2248 d02 . Here, the value W12,21 = (4\u03c9 4 /3)|2d01 d02 | could be considered\n\n\f41\nas the cross-correlation power (energy) of the two dipols. The total radiated power WQ of the two quantum dipoles\nseparated by the distance \u039b \u226a 2\u03c0/k0 is also given by WQ \u2248 4WQ01 . The quantum expression for the power of the\ntwo-dipole radiation differs from the classical one only in that it contains the matrix element of the dipole momentum\ninstead of the dipole momentum itself. The superradiance of the two classical or quantum dipoles is very similar to\nthe Dicke superradiance [25]. This simple analysis of two classical and quantum dipoles also could be considered as a\nproof of existence of a classical analogue [Refs. [24](a) and (c)] of the Dicke quantum superradiance. Notice, in the case\nof the number N > 1 of quantum dipoles, the Pauli exclusion principle for the electrons of the dipoles should be taken\ninto account. The Pauli principle states that no two identical electrons may occupy the same quantum state simultaneously. It should be stressed again that the cross-correlation energy of the interfering classical waves or particles\n(unit-waves), which does not exist in quantum mechanics and particle field theory, plays a key role in description of\nthe aforementioned interference phenomena. The cross correlation energy could be important also for understanding\nthe enhancement or suppression of the energy and momentum [Sec. (2.1.2.)] in other coherent processes involving\nclassical waves or particles. Here, one could mention the enhancement or suppression of the energy and momentum of a light pulse propagating in a dispersive medium. The phases of the different Fourier k-components of the\nwavepacket propagating in the same direction (k0n /k0n = k0 /k0 ) can be changed under the propagation. According\nto the present model the phase modification could result into the interference-induced enhancement or suppression\nof the pulse energy and momentum. The interference phenomenon could affect also the energy and momentum of a\nwave-packet scattering by the subwavelength scatters, such as nano-apertures, nano-particles and other nano-objects.\nFor more examples and details, see the study [24] and refrerences therein.\nNowadays, the problem associated with the superluminal signalling in quantum mechanics (the Einstein-PodolskyRosen paradox [10]), which follows from the J.S. Bell inequalities [11], but contradicts the Einstein special relativity,\nis considered as a most serious incompatibility between the two fundamental theories. Therefore, it is important\nto consider this problem in more details. The superluminal cross-correlation (signalling) between the two entangled\nparticles exceeds what would be predicted for classical (non-superluminal) correlation between the two wave-functions\n(see, the Bell inequalities [11]). In the present model, the entangled particles are considered as the parts of the same\nindivisible unit-wave of the physical matter, which has been reshaped in the transverse and/or longitudinal direction\ninto the entangled parts [strongly correlated (entangled) particles] by interaction (interference) of the unit-field with\nthe fields of other microscopic or macroscopic objects. As a consequence of the indivisibility of the reshaped unit-wave,\nwhich is composed from the entangled parts (\"entangled particles\"), the interference properties of the quantum wave\nof strongly correlated (entangled) particles are similar to that of an ordinary (non-composite) unit-wave. The shape,\ntemporal and spatial \"curvatures\" of the ordinary or composite unit-field can be changed, but the field cannot be\ndivided into different independent parts. In order to satisfy the experimentally observed superluminal signalling one\nhave to assume that any local change of the shape and/or \"curvature\" of the ordinary or composite unit-field of the\nphysical matter does propagate with superluminal (linear and/or rotational) velocity within the field. For instance, the\nsuperluminal rotational velocity within the spinor unit-field (electron) could be formally associated with the quantum\nspin of the particle. More precisely, in the present model, the quantum spin of the particle is attributed to the\nsign-coupling product SG (for details, see Part II), which characterizes the sign and value of the the cross-correlation\n(interaction, coupling) energy under the interference of two unit-waves [also, see comments to Eqs. (123) and (124),\nand Figs. (5)-(8)]. The superluminal velocity (signalling) within the ordinary or composite unit-field of the matter is\nattributed in the present model rather to the physical properties of the field medium than the empty space (vacuum)\nof the Einstein relativity. Therefore the superluminal signalling within the ordinary or composite unit-field of the\nphysical matter does not contradict the Einstein non-superluninal velocity of the signalling between the point particles\nseparated by the \"straight\" or \"curve\" empty space (Einstein's vacuum). It is not easy to find a classical analogue\nof the superluminal signalling within the ordinary unit-field or the unit-field like material medium of the composite\nunit-field (entangled particles). The superluminal signalling within the medium of an ordinary unit-field could be\nconsidered (interpreted), for instance, as a non-quantum or quantum analog of the wave propagation in the material\nbody, which has the \"modulus of bulk elasticity\" bigger than the \"coefficient of stiffness\" of any classical material\nmedium. If the incompressible medium of the ordinary unit-field has an infinite elasticity, the signal could propagate\nwithin the ordinary unit-field with infinite speed. The composite unit-field [entangled (strongly correlated) particles]\ncould be considered as a non-quantum or quantum analogue of Newton's cradle, a series of swinging spheres. In the\nNewton cradle, the identical bodies (particles) exchange velocities (momentums). If the first particle has nonzero\ninitial velocity and the second particle is at rest, then after collision the first particle will be at rest and the second\nparticle will travel with the initial velocity of the first particle. In the case of perfectly elastic collision of the totally\nrigid particles (the parts of the composite unit-field), the exchange of velocities (momentums) provides a so-called\n\"quantum jump\" taking zero time. Thus the signalling (\"quantum leap\") in the Newton cradle of unit-fields [strongly\ncorrelated (entangled) particles] is performed with infinite speed. Although the Newton cradle is one dimensional,\n\n\f42\nthe two or three dimensional cradle also could be considered as an analogue of the strongly correlated (entangled)\nquantum particles. Notice, according to the present model, the Bell superluminal signals [11] (the Einstein-PodolskyRosen paradox) and the well-known objects in astronomy, which propagate with velocities greater than the velocity\nof light, involve no physics incompatible with the theory of special relativity. In the present model, the superluminar\nvelocities of signals, the superluminar \"quantum leaps\" and the superluminar collapses of wavefunctions of any kind\nare attributed rather to the physical properties of the unit-field like material mediums than the \"straight\" or \"curve\"\nempty space of the Einstein special or general relativity (for details, see Part II).\nIn the context of the above-presented consideration of the quantum coherence and correlation, one should not confuse\na real finite-wave or real finite unit-wave of the real physical matter (mass-energy) with the wave of probability in\nquantum mechanics or with the wave of operators in particle field theory. One should not confuse also the first-order\ncoherency (cross-correlation) of the two fields in the same [(P, t) = (P1 , t1 ) = (P2 , t2 )] spacetime points, which are\nrelated to the cross-correlation energy, with the second or higher order coherency (cross-correlation) between the fields\nin the same [(P, t) = (P1 , t1 ) = (P2 , t2 )] or different [(P1 , t1 ) 6= (P2 , t2 )] spacetime points of the amplitude or intensity\ninterferometry. The degree of coherency of the fields in the first or the second order, in the same or different spacetime\npoints can be measured by using the conventional amplitude or intensity interferometry. It could be noted in this\nregard that any coherent or incoherent field is self-coherent. In the present model, the self-coherency is associated with\nthe conventional energy of a field, which is called the self-correlation energy or self-energy. Two finite waves (beams)\ndo interfere coherently in a space point if the phase difference between the waves in this point is constant in the time.\nThe coherency of the two fields in the same point is attributed in the present model to the cross-correlation and crosscorrelation energy in this point. If the phase difference is random or changing the fields are incoherent or partially\ncoherent in the point. In the points where the fields are incoherent, the interference of the fields yields zero value\nof the cross-correlation energy. That is to say that the interference between two (or more) finite fields (waves) in a\nspace point establishes a correlation (cross-correlation) between these waves in this point. The coherent superposition\nof the wave amplitudes is attributed to the ordinary (first-order) interference, which corresponds to the first-order\ncross-correlation and the respective (first-order) cross-correlation energy. In analogy to the first order coherence, the\nsecond order interference generalizes the interference between amplitudes to that between squares of amplitudes. The\nhigh-order cross-correlations have quite different properties in comparison to the first-order correlation. For instance,\nin the case of the complex, scalar, electric waves E1 = |E1 |ei\u03b11 and E2 = |E2 |ei\u03b11 , the first-order interference (crosscorrelation) attributed to the amplitude\u221ainterferometry\ndoes associate with the phase-dependent intensity (energy)\n\u221a\nI = (E1 + E2 )(E1 + E2 )\u2217 = I1 + I2 + 2 I1 I2 cos(\u03b11 \u2212 \u03b11 ), where 0 \u2264 I \u2264 Imax , I1 = E1 E1\u2217 and I2 = E2 E2\u2217 . The\nsecond-order cross-correlation (interference) associated with the intensity interferometry corresponds to the phase2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\nindependent intensity (energy) squared\n\u221a \u221aI = (I1 + I2 ) = I1 + I2 + 2I1 I2 , where I1 + I2 \u2264 I \u2264 Imax . Although the\nfirst-order cross-correlation term 2 I1 I2 cos(\u03b11 \u2212 \u03b11 ) associated with the first-order cross-correlation of the waves\nE1 and E2 depends on the phases \u03b11 and \u03b12 , the second-order cross-correlation term 2I1 I2 attributed to the secondorder cross-correlation of the wave intensities I1 and I2 does not depend on the wave phases. One should not confuse\nhere definitions of the first-order and second-order cross-correlation terms with the degrees of first-order and secondorder coherences of the amplitude and intensity interferometries. Notice, in the Newton mechanics, the first order\ncross-correlation does reflect formally a fact that the two-times increase of the particle velocity v increases the particle\nenergy \u03b5 in four times, \u03b5 = m(2v)2 /2. The free particle with zero velocity (v = 0) has zero energy (\u03b5 = 0). In canonical\nquantum mechanics and particle field theory, where a particle is associated with a wave of probability or a wave (field)\nof operators, the interference and correlations between two or more particles (waves) in the same [(P1 , t1 ) = (P2 , t2 )] or\ndifferent [(P1 , t1 ) 6= (P2 , t2 )] spacetime points are described mathematically by the second or higher order correlation\nfunctions. Note that the third-order correlation between the waves E1 and E2 corresponds the value I 3 = (I1 + I2 )3 ,\nwhich does not depend on the wave phases. It should be stressed that the second-order correlation, which is also\nindependent from the wave phases, does associate with the wave intensity (energy) squared. One could distinguish the\nsecond-order correlations attributed to the intensity interferometry associated with the Bose-Einstein correlations of\nbosons and the Fermi-Dirac second-order correlations of fermions. While in the Fermi-Dirac second-order correlations\nthe particles are antibunched, in the Bose-Einstein correlations they are bunched. Another distinction between the\nBose-Einstein and Fermi-Dirac correlations is that only the Bose-Einstein correlations can present quantum coherence.\nThe Copenhagen-Dirac postulate of the \"interference-less\", self-interfering particles strictly forbids existence of both\nthe interference (cross-correlation) between particles and the respective cross-correlation energy. According to the\ncanonical interpretation, the interference between two different particles never occurs and each particle interferes\n(cross-correlates) only with itself. Nevertheless, in the canonical quantum physics and particle field theory based\non the Copenhagen-Dirac postulate, the interference between particles and the respective cross-correlation energy\nare permitted, due to the unclear reasons, in the second or higher order of interference (cross-correlation) in the\nsame and/or different spacetime points. It is not completely clear up to now how the particles, which are free from\n\n\f43\nthe interference and cross-correlation with each other, provide the Bose-Einstein and Fermi-Dirac cross-correlations.\nAlthough the second-order, cross-correlation terms of the Bose-Einstein and Fermi-Dirac correlations in the quantum\nphysics and particle field theory are attributed to the energy of bosons and fermions, the second-order terms should\nbe associated rather with the energy squared than with the energy. The solution of the problem is analyzed and\ninterpreted in Part II.\n5. THE ROLE OF CROSS-CORRELATION ENERGY IN SEVERAL BASIC PHYSICAL PHENOMENA\n\nThe interference and coherence of the unit-waves (particles) is the necessary condition of existence of the crosscorrelation and cross-correlation energy in an ensemble of the unit-waves (Secs. 4.2. and 4.3.). As an example, the\npresent section shows a key role of the interference-induced positive and negative cross-correlation energies, which are\nthe nonexistent energies in quantum physics and particle field theory, in several basic coherent phenomena, such as the\nBose-Einstein condensation, super-radiation, Bosenova effect, superfluidity, superconductivity, supermagnetism, and\nquantum anomalous and fractional Hall effects. The coherent phenomena are first considered by using the traditional\nmodels of quantum mechanics and quantum field theory. Then they are compared with the predictions of the present\nmodel and the experimental observations.\nThe conventional interpretation of the quantum interference strictly forbids existence of the interference between\nparticles. Nevertheless, in canonical quantum mechanics and field theory based on the Copenhagen-Dirac postulate of\n\"interference-less\", self-interfering particles, the large-scale (macroscopic) quantum coherence and interference between\nparticles are permitted. That leads to the several basic coherent physical phenomena in the coherent quantum systems.\nFor instance, the superposition of particles obeying the properties of Bose-Einstein condensation, super-radiation,\nBosenova effect, superfluidity, superconductivity, supermagnetism, and quantum anomalous and fractional Hall effects\nare examples of the coherent phenomena and coherent quantum systems. The Bose-Einstein condensation, which is\nassociated with the second-order cross-correlation of bosons, is a consequence of the Bose-Einstein statistics and thus\napplicable to any kind of bosons. The Bose-Einstein condensation is at the origin of the most important condensed\nmatter phenomena, superconductivity and superfluidity. The Bose-Einstein correlations manifest themselves also in\nhadron interferometry and the Bose-Einstein correlation between particles and anti-particles. Another example, which\nemphasizes the non-classical properties of quantum coherence in macroscopic systems, is the Schr\u00f6dinger's cat thought\nexperiment. In the canonical quantum mechanics and particle field theory based on the Copenhagen-Dirac postulate,\nthe aforementioned phenomena could be attributed only to the self-coherence and self-interference (self-correlation)\nof particles, which do not require the interference between particles (wave-functions) and the particle coherency. In\nother words, the postulate strictly forbids existence of both the interference (cross-correlation) between particles and\nthe respective cross-correlation energy. The interference between two different particles never occurs and each particle\ninterferes (cross-correlates) only with itself. Nevertheless, the interference and cross-correlation in the traditional\nmodels of the aforementioned coherent phenomena are permitted, due to the unclear reasons, in the second-order\n(or higher) of interference and cross-correlation between particles. Although the traditional models of the coherent\nquantum phenomena work perfectly, the permission of interference between particles has not been explained up to now.\nAccording to the present model, the coherent phenomena are simply the direct consequences of the cross-correlation\nenergy mediated by the interference between particles (unit-fields). The coherence of the unit-waves (particles) is\nthe necessary condition of existence of the interference, cross-correlation and cross-correlation energy in an ensemble\nof the unit-waves (particles). The coherency of the unit-waves is destroyed by collisions of the coherent unit-fields\n(particles) with the incoherent or partially coherent particles of the external microscopic or macroscopic objects, for\ninstance with the material boundaries and/or detectors. Any superposition of the unit-waves (particles) obeying the\nthermodynamical equilibrium with the incoherent unit-fields (particles) of the high-temperature (T >> 0) boundaries\nhas zero cross-correlation energy.\nLet me begin consideration of the aforementioned coherent phenomena with a brief general analysis of the superradiation properties of several coherent quantum systems by using the present model and then compare them with\nthe canonical quantum mechanics and experimental observations. The active medium of lasers is an example of\nthe coherent quantum system, which is out of the high-temperature thermodynamical equilibrium. The process of\ninduced emission of a photon by an excited atom of the laser medium, which is described by the Einstein stimulated\nemission coefficient, results into creation of the two photons. The two photons (electromagnetic unit-waves) of the\nsame frequency are emitted at the same time, therefore they would be coherent. The unit-waves are identical,\nk01 = k02 \u2261 k0 and \u03b11 = \u03b12 . The cross-correlation energy \u03b512,21 of the coherent photon pair that satisfies the\ncondition (138) is then given by \u03b512,21 = 2k0 . Thus the total energy \u03b5 = 2k0 + 2k0 = 4k0 of the coherent photon pair\nis different from the Dirac energy \u03b5 = 2k0 (or more precisely \u03b5 = 2[k0 + (1/2)k0 ]) of the interference-less (correlation-\n\n\f44\nfree) photons. The energy \u03b5 = 4k0 , however, is in agreement with the well-known experimental fact that the energy\n\u03b5 of lasers operating in the super fluorescent mode is given by \u03b5 \u223c N 2 , where N is the number of the excited\natoms. Another example of the super-radiation is the Dicke superradiance of the subwavelength ensemble of excited\natoms [25]. Although the canonical quantum mechanics and quantum field theory strictly forbid existence of the\ninterference, cross-correlation and cross-correlation energy of particles [according to the Copenhagen-Dirac postulate,\na particle can interfere (correlate) only with itself], the interference and cross-correlation energy of particles appear in\nthe Dicke quantum model as the result of the particular mathematical approach (approximation). The interference\nand cross-correlation energy of particles do appear in the quantum-mechanical model due to the pure mathematical\nreason (approximation), namely due to the description of the radiating gas by a single quantum wave-function,\nwhich is composed from the cross-correlating mathematical wave-functions of the electrons of the individual atoms.\nThe \"mathematical cross-correlation (interference)\" induced by the cross-correlating mathematical wave-functions\nand the calculated cross-correlation energy then are incorrectly interpreted as the physical interference and energy\nof the correlated (coherent) motion of electrons in the atoms. Thus the canonical quantum mechanics, which is\nbased on the Copenhagen-Dirac postulate of \"interference-free\" particles, correctly describes the super-radiance if the\nmathematical structure of quantum mechanics is modified by the mathematical approximation. In other words, any\nphysical interpretation of the Dicke model, in fact, would be the interpretation of the mathematical approximation that\ndoes not compare well with the basic principle (Copenhagen-Dirac postulate) of the canonical quantum mechanics.\nIn the Dicke model, the momentums k0n and phases \u03b1n of the light unit-waves (photons) produced by the excited\natoms in the far-field zone are the same, k0n = k0 and \u03b1n = \u03b1. According to both the Dicke model and present\nmodel, the radiated energy scales as the number of atoms squared, \u03b5 \u223c N 2 . In addition to the Dicke superradiance,\nthe present model predicts the total destruction of the photons by the pure subtractive interference at the phase\ncondition \u03b1n \u2212 \u03b1m = \u03c0. Note that the energy \u2206\u03b5 spent on the excitation of an atom is given by \u2206\u03b5 = k0 . Thus\nthe superradiance of two atoms produces the extra energy \u03b5 = 4k0 \u2212 2k0 , which in the present model is attributed to\nthe cross-correlation energy \u03b512 = 2k0 . Notice, the physical mechanism behind the interference-induced extra energy\nis simply the four-times increase of the wave energy by the two-times increase of the wave amplitude. The energy\nconservation of the total macroscopic system under superradiance or superfluorescence is obtained if one takes into\nconsideration a fact that the excitation of an atom has the probabilistic character. The averaged energy spent on\nthe excitation of one atom, for instance, by an electron beam, usually exceeds the energy \u2206\u03b5 = k0 . The creation\nof the electron beam also requires the energy \u03b5 > k0 . Although the radiated energy increases under the additive\ninterference, the total energy of the physical system is conserved. The creation of conditions of the pure additive\ninterference requires the \"additional\" energy, which is added to the total physical system before the interference. The\nphysical system does not obey the shift symmetry of time because of the probabilistic character [irreversible character\nassociated with scattering and/or diffraction of unit-fields (particles)] of the excitation of an atom. Therefore, the\nenergy nonconservation associated with the cross-correlation energy does not contradict the Noether theorem. The\nenergy conservation of the total physical system is provided rather by the probabilistic exchange of the energy with\nthe environment than by the shift symmetry of time. In contrast to the pure constructive or destructive interference,\nthe creation of conditions of the normal (ordinary), for instance, in classical interferometers, does not require the\nadditional energy. The energy conservation of the total physical system is provided by the shift symmetry of time of\nsuch a system. Such systems do not include the irreversible processes associated with the irreversible (probabilistic)\nscattering and/or diffraction of the unit-fields (particles).\nIn the canonical quantum mechanics and particle field theory, the physical mechanism behind the superfluidity,\nsuperconductivity, and supermagnetism is usually clarified by considering a Bose-Einstein condensate [27, 28, 31].\nIt is generally accepted that the mechanism of a Bose-Einstein condensate is the large-scale quantum coherence. In\nthe present model, the large-scale classical and quantum coherence (interference) of the boson unit-fields also leads\nto the aforementioned coherent phenomena. The difference between the present model and the traditional quantum\nmechanical models, is in the interpretation of quantum interference [see, the analysis of Young's experiment in Sec.\n(4.3.)] and in the absence of both the interference between particles and the respective cross-correlation energy in the\ncanonical quantum mechanics and particle field theory based on the Copenhagen-Dirac postulate of \"interference-less\",\nself-interfering particles. Let me briefly describe the Bose-Einstein condensation in the frame of canonical quantum\nmechanics and compare that with the present model. It is generally accepted that all the atoms (boson-like particles)\nthat make up the Bose-Einstein condensate are coherent. The atoms are thus necessarily all described by a single\nquantum wave-function, which according to quantum mechanics is responsible for the condensate super-properties.\nEinstein has demonstrated, by using rather the statistical approach than the quantum mechanical arguments, that\ncooling boson atoms to a very low temperature would cause them to condense into the lowest accessible quantum\n\n\f45\nstate, resulting in a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) [27, 28]. This transition occurs below a critical temperature\nTc \u2248 3.31(mkB )\u22121 (N/V )2/3 ,\n\n(142)\n\nwhich is calculated by integrating over all momentum states the expression for maximum number of excited particles [28]:\nZ \u221e\n2\n(143)\nN =V\n(2\u03c0)\u22123 (e\u2212k /2mkB Tc \u2212 1)\u22121 d3 k,\n0\n\nwhere N/V is the particle density, and m is the particle mass. In the traditional description of BEC, all the boson-like\nparticles that make up the condensate are modeled to be in-phase (coherent). Respectively, the all particles are\ndescribed by a single quantum wave-function \u03a8(r, t), which determines\nR the super-properties of BEC. As long as the\nnumber of particles of BEC is fixed, the values \u03a8\u2217 (r)\u03a8(r) and N = \u03a8\u2217 (r)\u03a8(r)d3 x are interpreted as the particle\ndensity and the total number of atoms, respectively. The dynamics of wave-function \u03a8(r) of the ground state of the\nBEC system of identical bosons is conventionally described by using the Hartree-Fock approximation (extension of\nthe mean field theory). In the Hartree-Fock approximation, the total wave-function of the system of N bosons is\ntaken as a product of single-particle functions, \u03a8(r1 , r2 , ..., rN ) = \u03c81 (r1 )\u03c82 (r2 )...\u03c8N (rN ) \u2261 \u03c8(r1 )\u03c8(r2 )...\u03c8(rN ). Note\nthat the wave-functions (particles) are indistinguishable in such a case. In other words, the boson wave-functions are\nthe same, \u03c8n (rn ) \u2261 \u03c8(rn ) and \u03c8n\u2217 (rn ) \u2261 \u03c8 \u2217 (rn ), where n = 1, ..., N . Provided essentially all bosons have condensed\nto the ground state, and treating the bosons by the mean field theory, the energy \u03b5 = H associated with the stat \u03a8\nis given by the model Hamiltonian of the BEC system based on the Hartree-Fock approximation as\nH=\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\n0\n\n3\n\nhd x =\n\nN\nX\n\nn=1\n\nHnn +\n\n2\nNX\n\u2212N\n\nn6=m\n\nHnm ,\n\n(144)\n\nwith\nN\nX\n\nn=1\n\nHnn =\n\nN Z\nX\n\nn=1\n\n\u221e\n\n[(1/2m0 )\u03c8n\u2217 (rn )\u22072 \u03c8(rn ) + Uext (rn )\u03c8n\u2217 (rn )\u03c8n (rn )]d3 xn\n\n0\n\n(145)\n\nand\n2\nNX\n\u2212N\n\nn6=m\n\nHnm =\n\n2\nNX\n\u2212N\n\nn6=m\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n\u221eZ \u221e\n0\n\n\u03c8 \u2217 (rn )\u03c8 \u2217 (rm )U (|rn \u2212 rm |)\u03c8(rn )\u03c8(rm )d3 xn d3 xm ,\n\n(146)\n\nwhere m0 is the mass of the boson, Uext (r) is the external potential, U (|rn \u2212 rm |) = (g/2)\u03b4(|rn \u2212 rm |) is the interaction\n(potential) energy of the interaction of the n-th particle with the m-th particle, g is the coupling parameter that\nrepresents the value of the inter-particle interaction, and \u03b4(|rn \u2212 rm |) denotes the Dirac delta-function. Minimizing\nthis energy with respect to infinitesimal variations in \u03c8(r) and holding the number of bosons constant yields the\nwell-known Gross-Pitaevski model equation (GPE) of motion for the single-particle wave-function [29, 30]:\ni\n\n\u2202\u03c8(r, t)\n= [(\u22121/2m0)\u22072 + Uext (r) + g\u03c8 \u2217 (r)\u03c8(r)]\u03c8(r).\n\u2202t\n\n(147)\n\nIf the single-particle wave-function satisfies the Gross-Pitaevski equation, the total\nR wave-function \u03a8 minimizes the\nexpectation value of the Hamiltonian (144) under normalization condition N = \u03a8\u2217 (r)\u03a8(r)d3 x. The Hamiltonian\n(144) and GPE (147) provide a good description of the behavior of the Bose-Einstein condensates and are thus conventionally used for clarification of the basic properties of BEC. The super-properties of BEC describing by Eqs. (144) P 2\n(147) have their origins in the interaction between the particles describing by the interaction energy n6N=\u2212N\nm Hnm and\nthe respective potential energy g\u03c8 \u2217 (r)\u03c8(r). This becomes evident by equating the coupling constant g of interaction in\nPN\nEqs. (146) and (147) with zero, on which the ordinary Hamiltonian H = n=1 Hnn and Schr\u00f6dinger equation describing a particle inside a trapping potential are recovered. It should be stressed that the same result is obtained if one\nexcludes\n(interference) between the wave-functions\nof the individual bosons from the term (146),\nR \u221e R \u221e \u2217the cross-correlation\nR\u221e\n\u2217\n\u03c8 (rn )\u03c8 \u2217 (rm )(g/2)\u03b4(|rn \u2212 rm |)\u03c8(rn )\u03c8(rm )d3 xn d3 xm = (g/2) 0 [\u03c8n\u2217 (r)\u03c8m (r)][\u03c8m\n(r)\u03c8n (r)]d3 x = 0. Here,\n0\n0\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u03c8(rn ) \u2261 \u03c8n (rn ), \u03c8(rm ) \u2261 \u03c8m (rm ), \u03c8 (rn ) \u2261 \u03c8n (rn ) and \u03c8 (rm ) \u2261 \u03c8m (rm ) due to the indistinguishableness of\n\n\f46\nthe bosons (wave-functions). With the help of the present model, one can easily recognize the trial mathematically constructed second-order cross-correlation term (146) as the counterpart [see, Eq. (6)] of the first-order crosscorrelation energy of the Bose-Einstein condensate. Although the canonical quantum mechanics strictly forbids the\nexistence of the interference, cross-correlation and cross-correlation energy [a particle can interfere (correlate) only\nwith itself], in the quantum mechanical description of BEC, the interference between particles and the respective\ncross-correlation energy do appear in the second order of the cross-correlation as the result of using the HartreeFock mathematical approximation. In other words, the interference between particles and cross-correlation energy do\nappear in the BEC quantum-mechanical model due to the Hartree-Fock approximation of the quantum system by\nusing a trial mathematical wave-function \u03a8(r1 , r2 , ..., rN ), which is the product of the mathematically cross-correlating\nsingle functions associated with the single particles, \u03a8(r1 , r2 , ..., rN ) = \u03c81 (r1 )\u03c82 (r2 )...\u03c8N (rN ) \u2261 \u03c8(r1 )\u03c8(r2 )...\u03c8(rN ).\nThen the calculated cross-correlation term (146), which has the form of the second-order cross-correlation function\nPN 2 \u2212N\nPN 2 \u2212N R \u221e \u2217\n\u2217\n3\nn6=m Hnm = (g/2)\nn6=m\n0 \u03c8n (r)\u03c8m (r)\u03c8m (r)\u03c8n (r)d x 6= 0, is interpreted as the interaction energy. Remember, the second-order cross-correlation is attributed rather to the square of energy in intensity interferometry than the\nenergy in amplitude interferometry (see, Sec. 4.3.). Thus the \"modified\" quantum mechanics [the quantum mechanics\nbased on the interference and cross-correlation energy of particles automatically inserted into the model by using\nthe mathematical approximations, which are inconsistent with the Copenhagen-Dirac postulate of \"interference-less\",\nself-interfering particles] correctly describes BEC. In the present model, the super-properties of BEC are similar to\nthe quantum mechanical properties describing by Eqs. (144) - (147), which use the \"modified\" quantum mechanics.\nThe difference between the \"modified\" quantum mechanics of BEC and the present model is in the interpretation of\nquantum interference and in the absence of the interference, cross-correlation and cross-correlation energy of particles\nin the canonical quantum mechanics based on the Copenhagen-Dirac postulate.\nIt should be stressed again in the context of the above-presented consideration that a particle of canonical quantum mechanics associated with the wave of probability is free from the interference (cross-correlation) with other\nparticles. The Hartree-Fock mathematical approximation automatically inserts the \"hidden\" interference between\nparticles and the respective cross-correlation energy into BEC. Such a kind of the \"hidden\" interference (mathematical cross-correlation), however, is different from the ordinary interference of the present model. Indeed, the\ncross-correlation energy associated with the approximation-induced cross-correlation (\"hidden\" interference) between\ntwo or more particles in the same [(rn ) = (rm ) = (r)]\nof BEC is described in the Hartree-Fock approxiR \u221e Rpoints\n\u221e\nmation by the second order cross-correlation function 0 0 \u03c8 \u2217 (rn )\u03c8 \u2217 (rm )(g/2)\u03b4(|rn \u2212 rm |)\u03c8(rn )\u03c8(rm )d3 xn d3 xm =\nR\u221e\n\u2217\n(g/2) 0 [\u03c8n\u2217 (r)\u03c8m (r)][\u03c8m\n(r)\u03c8n (r)]d3 x 6= 0, which does not depend on the values of the particle phases. In other words,\nthe quantum Hamiltonian (144) of BEC constructed by using the Hartree-Fock approximation is invariant under the\nU (1) local gauge transformation (\u03c8n \u2192 \u03c8n\u2032 = ei\u03b1n \u03c8n ). The U (1) gauge symmetry of the trial Hamiltonian (144)\nprovides the very particular (in comparison to the ordinary interference) mathematical cross-correlation (\"hidden\"\ninterference) and the respective cross-correlation energy, which do not depend on the phases of the wave-functions\nof particles. In such a case, the boson-like particles that make up the Bose-Einstein condensate may have absolutely\ndifferent phases providing the BEC and its super-properties without the particle coherence. However, it is generally\naccepted that all the wave-functions of the boson-like particles that make up the BEC must be in-phase. That indicates that the cross-correlation (\"hidden\" interference) in the traditional models of BEC is provided rather by the\nmathematical approximation than the large-scale classical or quantum coherence. The \"hidden\" interference is usually interpreted as the inter-particle interaction describing by the interaction (potential) energy. The present model\ndescribes the cross-correlation energy associated with the interference and correlation between particles (unit-fields)\nby the first-order cross-correlation function, which does depend on the unit-field phases. The cross-correlation energy\nin the present model does not depend on the unit-field phases only if all the particles (unit-fields) are incoherent.\nIndeed, the time-averaged cross-correlation energy (141) of the unit-fields with random phases is equal to zero due\nto the non-correlation of such fields. One could distinguish the Bose-Einstein second-order bunched correlation of\nbosons attributed to the intensity interferometry from the first-order cross-correlation and cross-correlation energy\nof the unit-fields (bosons) associated with the amplitude interferometry. It should be mentioned again that the\nCopenhagen-Dirac postulate strictly excludes existence of both the interference (cross-correlation) between different\nparticles and the respective cross-correlation energy. According to the postulate, the interference between different\nparticles never occurs, each particle interferes (cross-correlates) only with itself. Therefore the interference and crosscorrelation of coherent particles in the traditional models of the Bose-Einstein condensate should be attributed rather\nto the self-interference of particles than the interference (cross-correlation) between particles. In these models, the\ninterference, cross-correlation and cross-correlation energy of particles do appear in the second-order of interference\n(cross-correlation) due to the pure mathematical reason (the Hartree-Fock approximation), which does not compare\nwell with the canonical interpretation of quantum interference. Moreover, the second-order interference corresponds\n\n\f47\nto the \"intensity interferometry\", which is associated rather with the energy (intensity) squared \u03b52 than the energy\n\u03b5 = H. The problem is analyzed in details in Part II of the present study.\nThe above-described differences between the traditional quantum theory of BEC and the present model are summarized and interpreted as follows. The interference-induced cross-correlation energy, which does not exist in the\ncanonical quantum mechanics based on the Copenhagen-Dirac postulate of quantum self-interference, is permitted\nin the BEC quantum model in the form of the interaction energy (146). According to the postulate, the BEC and\nits extraordinary properties are provided by the self-coherence of particles. Although the particles (wave-functions)\nof BEC are modelled to be in-phase, the quantum self-interference of a particle does not require coherency with\nother particles. The self-interfering particles (wave-functions) may have absolutely different phases providing the\nBEC and its extraordinary properties. The second-order, phase-independent cross-correlation term (146) is responsible for the interaction (\"hidden\" interference) between the different particles. The cross-correlation integral in the\nexpression (146) is usually interpreted as exchange one. According to quantum mechanics, the integral describes\nthe quantum exchange of particles associated with the indistinguishableness of the identical bosons. The quantum exchange of bosons is somewhat similar to the exchange of virtual particles in a short time (\u2206t \u2264 1/\u2206\u03b5) in\nthe perturbation quantum theory. The BEC quantum system is described mathematically by a trial mathematical\nwave-function composed from the cross-correlating, single mathematical functions associated with the single particles\n[\u03a8(r1 , r2 , ..., rN ) = \u03c81 (r1 )\u03c82 (r2 )...\u03c8N (rN ) \u2261 \u03c8(r1 )\u03c8(r2 )...\u03c8(rN )], which yields the mathematical phase-independent\ncross-correlation (\"hidden\" interference) between particles and the respective phase-independent cross-correlation energy. In the model, the \"hidden\" interference is interpreted as the inter-particle interaction having the interaction\nenergy mediated by the quantum exchange of particles. Remember, the same mathematical approach yielding the\n\"hidden\" interference between particles induced by the pure mathematical reason (approximation), which contradicts\nthe Copenhagen-Dirac postulate, has been originally used by R. H. Dicke for the mathematical construction of the\nquantum-mechanical model of the superradiance [25]. The model Hamiltonian (144) of BEC is also engineered mathematically by using the same (Hartree-Fock) approximation, which yields the interference and cross-correlation energy\nof particles, in the second order of the mathematical cross-correlation. The dynamics of the trial single-particle wavefunction of BEC is described by the Gross-Pitaevski model equation derived by using the trial Hamiltonian (144). As\nan example of the mathematical (\"hidden\") interference, one could mention also the well-known Bogoliubov treatment\nof the Gross-Pitaevskii equation, which help to find the elementary excitations of a Bose-Einstein condensate and to\ndemonstrate the BEC super-fluidity. To that purpose, the condensate wave-function is approximated by a sum of the\nequilibrium wave-function and a small perturbation. In the model, the Bose gas does exhibit an energy (velocity)\ngap. The energy (velocity) gap, according to Landau's criterion, shows that the condensate is a super-fluid, meaning\nthat if an object is moved in the condensate at an energy (velocity) smaller than the energy (velocity) gap, it will not\nbe energetically favourable to produce excitations. The object will move without dissipation, which is a characteristic\nof a superfluid. The same result was found also by using the second quantization of the Bogoliubov wave-function of\nBEC. For the comparison, in the present model, the physical mechanism of the BEC superfluidity is not mediated\nby mathematical approximations. In the model, a quantum particle is considered as an indivisible unit-field of the\nphysical matter. The dynamics of the unit-field is described by the Euler-Lagrange equation of motion [12\u201319] with\nthe initial and boundary conditions imposed. The energy of the superposition of material unit-fields is given by the\nPN 2 \u2212N\nrespective Hamiltonian of the system, which contains the cross-correlation energy n6=m Hnm [in the first order\nof the cross-correlation (interference)] without mathematical approximations [see, Secs. (2)-(4)]. The interaction\nR \u221e \u2202\u03c8n\u2217 \u2202\u03c8m\nP 2\n\u2217\n\u2217\n3\n(cross-correlation) energy is given by n6N=\u2212N\nm Hnm , where Hnm = 0 [ \u2202t \u2202t + \u2207\u03c8n * \u2207\u03c8m + mn \u03c8n mm \u03c8m ]d x.\nThe field of BEC is considered as the superposition of individual coherent or partially coherent unit-fields (bosons),\nPN 2 \u2212N\nPN\n\u03a8(r1 , r2 , ..., rN ) = n=1 \u03c8n (rn ). The interaction (cross-correlation) energy n6=m Hnm of the bosons (harmonic\nwave-like unit-fields) has been calculated in Sec. (2). The interaction of the boson unit-waves of BEC with any\nperturbing wave is possible only in the case k\u2032 = k0 [see, the condition (137)], where k\u2032 and k0 = kn = km are the\nmomentums of the perturbing wave and the boson unit-waves of BEC, respectively. If the absolute values and/or\ndirections of the momentums are different, then the time-averaged energy of the interaction (cross-correlation) of\nthe BEC with the perturbing wave is zero. That is to say that the perturbation could not resist the BEC current\nproviding the phenomena of superfluidity. The interpretation is somewhat different from the traditional mechanism,\nwhich does use the energy (velocity) gap in the explanation of superfluidity.\nAlthough the quantum mechanical model and the present models are very similar in many aspects (see, the abovepresented discussion), the following basic properties of BEC do exist in the present model, only. In the present model\n[see, Secs. (2)-(4)], the total energy H = N \u03b50 of the cross-correlating unit-waves (bosons) in BEC is given by\n0 \u2264 H \u2264 N 2 \u03b50 ,\n\n(148)\n\n\f48\nwhere \u03b50 = (k20 + m20 )1/2 is the particle energy in the ground state, and\n0 \u2264 N \u2264 N2\n\n(149)\n\nis the effective number of the unit-waves (particles) \u03c8(rn ) \u2261 \u03c80n (r). The effective number of particles N , which is\ndetermined by the phases \u03b1n of the unit-waves, can be a non-integer:\nN =N+\n\n2\nNX\n\u2212N\n\nei\u2206\u03b1nm .\n\n(150)\n\nn6=m\n\nThe momentum P of BEC is given by\nP = N k0 ,\n\n(151)\n\n2\nwhere k0 = k0g is the momentum of the unit-wave (particle) in the ground state. Notice, the value k0g\n= 3\u03c0 2 V \u22122/3\nif BEC is closed into the resonator-like box of the volume V , and the external potential U (r)\u21920. If the electric\nunit-charge q0 is associated with the mass m0 of the unit-wave \u03c80n (r) \u2261 \u03c8(rn ) [see comments to Eqs. (123) and\n(124), and Figs. (5)-(8)], then the charge Q (0 \u2264 Q \u2264 N 2 q0 ) of the cross-correlating unit-fields is given by\n\nQ = N q0 ,\n\n(152)\n\nwhere the value N can be a non-integer. Here, the Pauli exclusion principle for the fermions (unit-waves) should be\ntaken into account in concrete calculations of the field parameters. The Pauli principle states that no two identical\nfermions may occupy the same quantum state simultaneously. Therefore, the charged unit-field should be a boson-like\ncomposite unit-field (particle). Similarly, if the magnetic moment ~\u03bc0 is associated with the mass m0 of the unit-field\n~\n\u03c80n (r) \u2261 \u03c8(rn ) [see comments to Eqs. (123) and (124), and Figs. (5)-(8)], then the effective magnetic moment M\n2\n~\n(0 \u2264 M \u2264 N ~\u03bc0 ) of the cross-correlating unit-fields is given by\n~ = N ~\u03bc0 ,\nM\n\n(153)\n\nwhere the value N can be a non-integer.\nIt is generally accepted that all boson-like particles that make up BEC at the temperature T << Tc are in-phase\n(see, the above-considered conventional quantum mechanical description of BEC). In such a case, the effective number\nof particles (150) in BEC is given by\nN = N 2.\n\n(154)\n\nRespectively, Eqs. (148)-(153) yielded the extraordinary values\nH = N 2 \u03b50 ,\n\n(155)\n\nP = N 2 k0 ,\n\n(156)\n\nQ = N 2 q0 ,\n\n(157)\n\n~ = N 2 ~\u03bc0\nM\n\n(158)\n\nand\n\nof the energy, momentum, charge and magnetic moment of BEC, which are responsible for the BEC super-properties.\nNotice, although the boson parameters associated with the charge have been formally introduced [see, Eqs. (152),\n(153), (157) and (158)] into the BEC model, the nonexistence of the boson/antiboson charges is determined rather by\nthe experimental data than the model (see, Part II). The anomalous values of the physical parameters of BEC at the\nlow temperatures (T << Tc ) are obtained also in the case of annihilation of the unit-waves \u03c80n (r) and \u03c80m (r), which\nis provided by the pure subtractive interference of the unit-waves at the phase condition \u2206\u03b1nm = \u03b1n \u2212 \u03b1m = \u00b1\u03c0.\n~ = 0. If the boson gas is in the\nThe physical parameters of the annihilated BEC do vanish, N = H = P = Q = M\n\n\f49\nthermodynamical equilibrium at the temperatures T >> Tc , the cross-correlation energy is equal to zero and the BEC\nenergy hHiT = N h\u03b50 iT is equal to the ordinary mean thermal energy:\nhHiT = N (3/2)kB T,\n\n(159)\n\nwhere N is the total number of the particles. Notice, Eq. (159) uses the non-relativistic particle energy \u03b50 \u2248 (k20 /2m0 ),\nwhere the irrelevant relativistic part (energy \u03b5 = m0 ) has been discarded. At the intermediate temperatures (T \u223c Tc )\nthe boson gas contains the particles with the extraordinary and ordinary physical properties. In other words, the gas\ncontains the Nic < N incoherent (ordinary) unit-waves and the Nc = N \u2212 Nic coherent (extraordinary) unit-waves.\nIf the coherent particles (unit-waves) are in-phase, the effective number of such particles is given by Nc = Nc2 =\n(N \u2212 Nic )2 . The phase transition from the incoherent (ordinary) state of the gas to the BEC state takes place below\na critical temperature Tc , which is calculated by assuming the equality of the effective number of coherent particles\nto the number of incoherent particles (Nc = Nic ):\nNc2 = N \u2212 Nc .\n\n(160)\n\nAccording to Eq. (154), even the small fraction (Nc << Nic ) of the coherent unit-waves (particles) would dominate\n(Nc >> Nic ) the gas physical properties if\nNc > [N + (1/4)]1/2 \u2212 (1/2).\n\n(161)\n\nFor instance, below the critical temperature, the coherent physical properties of the one hundred and one (Nc = 101)\ncoherent particles would dominate the ten thousand (Nic = 10000) incoherent particles of BEC [see, Eqs. (154)-(158)].\nIf the dependence of the number of coherent particles on the temperature is known, then the value Tc is calculated\nby using Eq. (160). For instance, at the exponential decrease of the number of coherent particles with increasing the\ngas temperature, the value Nc is given by\n2\nNc = N 2 exp(\u2212(3/2)kB T (k0g\n/2m)\u22121 + 1),\n\n(162)\n\n2\nwhere Nc = N 2 at the condition (3/2)kB T = k0g\n/2m. In the case of BEC closed into the resonator-like box of the\nvolume V and the external potential U (r)\u21920, the expression (160) yields the following equation for the calculation\nof the critical temperature Tc :\n\ne2 N 3 exp(\u22122\u03c0 \u22122 mkB V 2/3 Tc ) + eN exp(\u2212\u03c0 \u22122 mkB V 2/3 Tc ) \u2212 1 = 0,\n\n(163)\n\nwhere e \u2261 exp(1). In the limits of the low and high temperatures, Eq. (163) yields the analytical solutions\nTc \u2248 (1/2)\u03c0 2 (mkB )\u22121 V \u22122/3 (e2 N 3 + eN \u2212 1)(2e2 N 3 + eN )\u22121\n\n(164)\n\nTc \u2248 \u03c0 2 (mkB )\u22121 V \u22122/3 lnN,\n\n(165)\n\nand\n\nrespectively. The critical temperature (164) is somewhat different from the Einstein critical temperature (142).\nHowever, the value (165) compares well with the temperature (142). The exact dependence of the critical temperature\nTc on the particle density, which is described by Eq. (163), has more complicated character in comparison to\nthe Einstein model. One can easily calculate the critical temperatures by using the present model also for more\nsophisticated experimental conditions in the Bode-Einstein condensate. The physical mechanism behind the critical\ntemperature Tc of the phase transition in the Bose-Einstein condensate could be clarified better by considering the\nsimplest BEC. The bounded unit-field boson pair, the pair that has the minimum energy at the distance R 6= \u221e,\nhas been considered in Sec. (4) as a stable composite particle. The composite particle can occupy the stable\nstate even when the first and second particles have zero momentums, k1 = k2 = 0. In the frame of the present\nmodel, a composite particle could be considered as the simplest (two-particle, N = 2) Bose-Einstein condensate with\nTc \u2248 (1/2)\u03c0 2 (mkB )\u22121 V \u22122/3 (e2 23 +2e\u22121)(2e223 +2e)\u22121 . The two-particle condensate (composite particle) dissociates\ninto the two independent (free) particles if the mean thermal kinetic energy hHiT = 2(3/2)kB T of the two particles is\nbigger than the energy-mass defect \u2206H = H \u2212 (H11 + H22 ) = H12 + H21 [see comments to Eqs. (9), (35), (121)-(128),\nand Figs. (5)-(8)] of the composite particle, hHiT > H12 + H21 . The dissociation at the temperature T > Tc , where\nTc = [H12 + H21 ]/3kB , is the physical mechanism behind the phase transition in the simplest (two-particle, N = 2)\nBose-Einstein condensate describing by the Einstein critical temperature Tc \u2248 3.31(mkB )\u22121 (2/V )2/3 [see, Eq. (142)].\n\n\f50\nThe physical mechanism attributed to the difference between the mean thermal kinetic energy of particles and the\nenergy-mass defect (potential energy) of the Bose-Einstein condensate is somewhat different from the thermodynamical\ninterpretations of the critical temperature of the phase transition in the phenomenological and microscopic models of\nBEC based on the Copenhagen-Dirac postulate and the Hartree-Fock mathematical approximation in the canonical\nquantum mechanics.\nLet me now briefly consider the other coherent quantum phenomena associated with the macroscopic quantum\ncoherence (interference), namely the superfluidity, superconductivity, supermagnetism, Bosenova effect, and quantum\nanomalous and fractional Hall effects. I should first demonstrate the relationships of the aforementioned extraordinary physical phenomena with the Bose-Einstein condensation, and then compare them with the present model. It is\nconvenient to begin such a kind of analysis with consideration of the superconductivity. The phenomenological semimicroscopic Ginzburg-Landau theory (GLT) of superconductivity [32], which combines Landau's phenomenological\nmacroscopic theory of second-order phase transitions with a Schr\u00f6dinger-like wave equation, had a great success in\nexplanation of the macroscopic properties of superconductors. Although the Landau theory and GLT are constructed\nphenomenologically, they are usually interpreted as the semi-microscopic mean field theories (MFT). Any true microscopical MFT replaces all microscopic interactions to any one particle with an average or effective interaction. That\nreduce the multi-particle problem into an effective one-particle problem. The approximation mathematical procedure\nis quit similar to the Hartree-Fock mathematical approach, which yields the \"hidden\" interference, cross-correlation\nand cross-correlation energy of particles in the BEC quantum mechanical model. Probably, the MFT nature of the\nLandau theory and GLT is a mathematical reason of a great success of semi-microscopic Ginzburg-Landau model in\nexplanation of the macroscopic properties of superconductors. The true microscopic fundamental quantum models\n(the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) and Bogoliubov quantum models) of superconductivity have been proposed by\nJ. Bardeen, L. N. Cooper and J. R. Schrieffer [33] and independently N. N. Bogoliubov [34]. The \"hidden\" interference\nbetween particles and the respective cross-correlation energy in these two fundamental models also may be interpreted\nas the result of the Copenhagen-Dirac postulate of \"interference-less\", self interfering particles and the Hartree-Fock\nlike mathematical approximation. Indeed, in the normal state of a metal, the electrons move independently, whereas\nin the BCS state, they are bound into \"Cooper pairs\" by the attractive interaction through the exchange of phonons.\nThe BCS theory explains the superconducting current as a superfluid of Cooper pairs. Thus the superconductivity\nis interpreted as a macroscopic effect, which results from \"condensation\" of Cooper pairs. The pairs have boson\nproperties, while bosons, at sufficiently low temperature, can form the above-described Bose-Einstein condensate.\nThe BCS method [33] of the mathematical approximation, which yields the \"hidden\" interference, cross-correlation\nand cross-correlation energy in the quantum model of superconductivity based on the Copenhagen-Dirac postulate\nof \"interference-less\", self interfering particles is quite similar to the Hartree-Fock approximation (MFT extension)\nof the above-described model of BEC. In the BEC model, a trial mathematical wave-function \u03a8(r1 , r2 , ..., rN ) of the\nquantum many-particle system is the product \u03a8(r1 , r2 , ..., rN ) = \u03c81 (r1 )\u03c82 (r2 )...\u03c8N (rN ) \u2261 \u03c8(r1 )\u03c8(r2 )...\u03c8(rN ) of the\ncross-correlating, mathematical, single functions \u03c8n (rN ) associated with the N single bosons yielding the \"hidden\"\ninterference (mathematical cross-correlation) between the bosons. The BCS model may be interpreted as a model,\nwhere a trial mathematical wave-function \u03a8 of the BCS quantum system of the N electrons is the product\n\u03a8(R1 , R2 , ..., RN/2 ) = \u03c81 (R1 )\u03c82 (R2 )...\u03c8N/2 (RN/2 ) \u2261 \u03c8(R1 )\u03c8(R2 )...\u03c8(RN/2 )\n\n(166)\n\nof the cross-correlating functions \u03c8n (Rn ) associated with the N/2 electron pairs (Cooper's bosons) having the coordinates Rn . In the Bogoliubov model of superconductivity, the approximation mathematical method, which yields the\n\"hidden\" interference, cross-correlation and cross-correlation energy in the quantum model of superconductivity based\non the Copenhagen-Dirac postulate of \"interference-less\", self interfering particles, could be associated with the Bogoliubov transformations [34]. This extremely elegant and sophisticated transformation method is very similar to the\nHartree-Fock approximation (MFT extension). The Bogoliubov mathematical approach (approximation), however,\nuses rather the mathematically cross-correlating operators than the cross-correlating, single-particle mathematical\nfunctions \u03c8(rn ). In the Bogoliubov model, the \"hidden\" interference, cross-correlation and cross-correlation energy\nof particles are mediated by the \"cross-correlating\" commutators with the commutator relation\n[b\u0302, b\u0302\u2020 ] = (|u|2 + |v|2 )[\u00e2, \u00e2\u2020 ],\n\n(167)\n\nb\u0302 = u\u00e2 + v\u00e2\u2020 ,\n\n(168)\n\nb\u0302\u2020 = u\u2217 \u00e2\u2020 + v \u2217 \u00e2.\n\n(169)\n\nwhere\n\nand\n\n\f51\nHere, \u00e2 and \u00e2\u2020 are canonical annihilation and creation operators of the single boson particle. The Bogoliubov\ntransformation is a canonical transformation of the operators b\u0302 and b\u0302\u2020 . A superfluid is the Bose-Einstein condensate,\nwhich does possess some hydrodynamical properties that do not appear in ordinary fluid. Although the quantum\nmechanics of the superfluidity based on the Copenhagen-Dirac postulate of \"interference-less\", self interfering particles\nand the Hartree-Fock like or operator-based mathematical approximations is very similar to the superconductivity, the\nmicroscopic details of the phenomena are different. If superfluid particles are bosons, their superfluidity is regarded\nas a consequence of Bose-Einstein condensation in the system of interacting boson particles. If the particles are\nfermions, then the superfluidity is described by the generalization of BCS quantum theory of superconductivity. In\nthe generalized theory, Cooper pairing takes place between atoms rather than electrons, and the attractive interaction\nbetween them is mediated by spin fluctuations rather than phonons. A unified description of superconductivity and\nsuperfluidity is currently possible only by the quantum field theory in terms of the Hamiltonian-Lagrangian gauge\nsymmetry and gauge symmetry breaking. The present model provides a unified description of the two phenomena\nin terms of the cross-correlation energy associated with the ordinary interference of the boson or boson-like unitwaves (particles). The superfluid boson current density j is simply given by j = P/mV = Nc k0 /mV , where Nc\n(0 \u2264 Nc \u2264 N 2 ) is the effective number of the Nc coherent unit-waves (bosons), and N is the total number of bosons.\nThe density je of the electric super-current of the Cooper electron pairs (boson unit-waves) having the charge 2e\nand mass 2me is given by je = 2eP/2me V = eNc k0 /me V , where 0 \u2264 Nc \u2264 N 2 is the effective number of the\ncoherent Cooper bosons. Thus even small fraction (Nc << N ) of the coherent unit-waves (particles) would produce\nthe coherent current, whose physical properties would dominate the current associated with the incoherent unit-waves\n(particles). If all the BEC particles are in-phase, the effective number Nc = N 2 of the coherent unit-waves (bosons)\nwould provide the maximum value of the BEC current. It should be stressed again that interaction of the boson unitwaves of BEC with any perturbing wave is possible only in the case k\u2032 = k0 , where k\u2032 and k0 are the momentums of\nthe perturbing wave and the unit-waves of BEC, respectively [see, the condition (137)]. If the directions or absolute\nvalues of these momentums are different, then the energy of the interaction (cross-correlation) of the Bose-Einstein\ncondensate with the perturbing wave is zero. In other words, the perturbation does not resist the BEC current\nproviding the phenomena of superfluidity and superconductivity.\nSuperdiamagnetism (perfect diamagnetism) is a phenomenon occurring in certain materials at low temperatures,\ncharacterized by the complete absence of magnetic permeability and the exclusion of the interior magnetic field.\nAccording to the \"modified\" quantum mechanics, superdiamagnetism is a feature of superconductivity, which is\ndescribed by the quantum mechanics by a single wave-function [31] of the BEC state. The Bose-Einstein condensation\nalso applies to quasiparticles in solids. For instance, a magnon in an antiferromagnet carries spin 1 and thus obeys\nthe Bose-Einstein statistics. A magnetic ordering at the temperatures lower than the point of condensation is the\nanalog of superfluidity. The anomalous magnetic properties of the material, in the present model, are attributed to the\nextraordinary magnetic moment [see, Eqs. (153) and (158)] of the Bose-Einstein condensate. The quantum anomalous\nand fractional states of particles in quantum anomalous and fractional Hall effects are not connect directly with BEC.\nIndeed, the quantum anomalous Hall effect or most commonly the anomalous Hall effect is usually attributed either to\na disorder-related effect due to spin-dependent scattering of the charges or an effect which can be described in terms\nof the so-called Pancharatnam-Berry phase effect. Naturally, such effects can be easily reinterpreted as the \"hidden\"\ncross-correlation (interference) between particles. The fractional quantum Hall effect is a physical phenomenon in\nwhich the quantum system behaves as if it was composed of particles with charge smaller than the elementary charge.\nFractionally-charged quasiparticles, for instance, in the very elegant theory proposed by R.B. Laughlin [35], is based\non the trial mathematical wave-function\n\u03a8(r1 , r2 , ..., rN ) = [\u03a0N \u2265i\u2265j\u22651 (ri \u2212 rj )n ]\u03a0N\nk \u03c8(rk )\n\n(170)\n\nfor the ground state, as well as its quasiparticle and quasihole excitations, which is quite similar to the trial mathematical wave-function (166), which yields the \"hidden\" interference (mathematical cross-correlation) between particles\nand the respective cross-correlation energy. According to the theory of composite fermions, which was proposed by\nJ. K. Jain [36], in the repulsive interactions, two (or, in general, an even number) flux quanta are captured by each\nelectron, forming integer-charged quasiparticles called composite fermions. In this very effective theory, the fractional\nstates of electrons are understood as the integer quantum Hall effect of composite fermions, which may be reinterpreted\nas products of the \"hidden\" interference of particles. The present model interprets these effects simply in terms of\nthe interfering unit-waves (particles) with the effective number (0 \u2264 N \u2264 N 2 ) of particles, which can be fractional\nnumber bigger or smaller than one [see, Eq. (152)].\nIt is impossible in the present study to consider all the super-properties and coherent effects of the Bose-Einstein\ncondensate. However, one should mention the so-called Bosenova or Bose-supernova effect [37] recently observed in\nthe Bose-Einstein condensate. The effect is a small explosion, which can be induced by changing the magnetic field\n\n\f52\nin which the Bose-Einstein condensate is located, so that the BEC quantum wave-function's self-attraction becomes\nrepulsive. Under the explosion, a considerable part of the particles in the condensate disappears. The \"missing\"\nparticles (atoms) are undetectable in the experiments probably because they form into molecules or they get enough\nenergy from somewhere to fly away fast enough. Several mean-field quantum theories have been proposed to explain\nthe phenomenon. It seems that in the canonical quantum theories this characteristic of the Bose-Einstein condensate\nremains unexplained, because the energy of a particle near absolute zero appears to be insufficient to cause the\nimplosion. The present model describes the Bosenova explosion in terms of the repulsive force associated with the\ngradient of the cross-correlation energy (0 \u2264 H \u2264 N 2 \u03b50 ) of the interfering boson or boson-like particles (unit-waves).\nThe number of detectable particles, which is given by the effective number (0 \u2264 N \u2264 N 2 ) of particles, varies with\nchanging the interference conditions in the Bose-Einstein condensate. For the details of the interaction mechanism,\nsee Part II.\nThe all above-considered traditional models give the absolutely correct description and explanation of the extraordinary coherent physical phenomena, such as Bose-Einstein condensation, super-radiation, Bosenova effect, superfluidity,\nsuperconductivity, supermagnetism, and quantum anomalous and fractional Hall effects. The models are based on the\ncanonical quantum mechanics and quantum field theory based on the Copenhagen-Dirac postulate of \"interferenceless\", self interfering particles, which are modified by the different, generally-accepted mathematical approximations.\nThe trial Hamiltonians of the models are invariant under the U (1) local gauge transformation. Therefore the interference between particles and the respective cross-correlation energy in the models, which do not depend on the\nvalues of the particle phases, are provided mathematically by the second order cross-correlation functions. In other\nwords, the U (1) gauge symmetry of the trial Hamiltonians provides the very particular (in comparison to ordinary\ninterference) mathematical cross-correlation (\"hidden\" interference) and the respective cross-correlation energy, which\ndo not depend on the phases of the probability waves and the waves of operators associated with the particles. The\ninterpretations of such models are usually incorrectly based on the interpretations of the mathematical approximations\nused in the models. One could also stress that the Hamiltonians of both the modified and canonical quantum theories\nare constructed to be invariant under the U (1) local gauge transformation (\u03c8n \u2192 \u03c8n\u2032 = ei\u03b1n \u03c8n ) that provides the\n\"interference-less\" behaviour of particles due to the independence of the Hamiltonians on the phases \u03b1n of the waves\nof probabilities and operators.\nIn quantum mechanics, particle field theory and the present model, the Bose-Einstein condensation of bosons is\nintrinsically related to the Bose-Einstein statistics, Fermi-Dirac statistics and Pauli exclusion principle. The physical\nmechanism behind these phenomena in the present model, however, is different from the traditional mechanisms of\nquantum mechanics and particle field theory based on the waves (fields) of probabilities or the waves (fields) of operators. Unfortunately, the traditional mechanisms (interpretations) are extremely complicated and non-transparent.\nTherefore the traditional mechanisms should be discussed again, in the context of the present model, by emphasizing their pure mathematical nature associated with the different (powerful) mathematical approximations, which are\nbased on the use of mathematical objects (mathematically correlating wave-functions and commutators). For the\nsake of simplicity, the traditional mechanisms will be clarified by considering the most simple systems, namely the\ntwo-particle objects. In the canonical quantum mechanics, the two-particle system is described by an antisymmetric\n(fermion) or symmetric (boson) state, which is mathematically constructed by using the mathematical trial wavefunctions associated with the probability amplitudes of particles. According to the spin-statistics theorem of quantum\nmechanics the integer spin particles are bosons, while the half-integer spin particles are fermions. If the fermions\n(for instance, electrons) are the same, the mathematically constructed (trial) antisymmetric expression of the state\ngives zero. Therefore, in an antisymmetric state, two identical fermions cannot occupy the same single-particle states.\nThis is usually interpreted as the Pauli exclusion principle, which in such an interpretation form has a mathematical\ncharacter based on the mathematical properties of the antisymmetric state (antisymmetric function). In particle\nfield theory, the Pauli exclusion principle is sometimes attributed to the mathematical properties of the canonical\ncommutation relations (mathematical objects) associated with the fermion operators. The mathematical construction\nof the antisymmetric state (mathematical function associated with the wave of probability) in the canonical quantum\nmechanics or the commutation relation (trial commutator) of the fermion operators in particle field theory mathematically yields the Fermi-Dirac statistics (correlations), whose interpretations also have pure mathematical character. The\nPauli exclusion principle and Fermi-Dirac statistics mathematically forbid the Bose-Einstein condensation of particles\n(fermions). The modeling of the two-particle boson gas by the use of the mathematically constructed symmetric state\n(mathematical function) of the canonical quantum mechanics or the use of the mathematically constructed canonical\nand Bogoliubov's commutation relations for the mathematical operators in the quantum field theory does result into\nthe Bose-Einstein statistics (correlations), which mathematically permit the Bose-Einstein condensation. According\nto the quantum mechanics and particle field theory based on the Copenhagen-Dirac postulate of \"interference-less\",\nself-interfering particles and the different, generally-accepted mathematical approximations, the Bose-Einstein con-\n\n\f53\ndensation, Bose-Einstein statistics, Fermi-Dirac statistics and Pauli exclusion principle have their physical origins in\nthe interaction (\"hidden\" interference) between the particles describing by the interaction (cross-correlation) energy\nPN 2 \u2212N\nn6=m Hnm . The interaction energy is connected with the \"hidden\" interference mediated by the different mathematical approximations, which are based on the cross-correlating non-material wave-functions or the non-material\noperator commutators. In the present model, the physical mechanism behind the Bose-Einstein statistics, FermiDirac statistics and Pauli exclusion principle is attributed simply to the repulsive or attractive forces associating with\nthe additive or subtractive interference (cross-correlation) of the real unit-waves (bosons or fermions) of the matter\n(mass-energy).\nIt should be stressed again that the unified description of the interfering elementary particles (unit-fields) providing\nthe coherent (extraordinary) physical phenomena is given in Part II of the present study, where the Hamiltonian\nH11 of a unit-field (particle) is associated with the unit-field energy squared (H11 = \u03b520 = k20 + m20 ). Respectively,\nthe Hamiltonian H of the field composed from the N unit-fields (particles) is attributed to the total field-energy\nP\nPN 2 \u2212N\nsquared (H = \u03b52 = N\nn=1 Hnn +\nn6=m Hnm ). In such a case, the physical parameters of the interfering unit-fields\nare described by the respective equations of Secs. (3)-(5) with 0 \u2264 \u03b5 \u2264 N \u03b50 and 0 \u2264 N \u2264 N . The interference\nand cross-correlation energy of these unit-fields is attributed to the second-order cross-correlation of the intensity\ninterferometry. In Part I of the present study, the Hamiltonian H11 of a particle is associated with the unit-field\nenergy H11 = \u03b50 = [k20 + m20 ]1/2 , and the Hamiltonian H of the field composed from the N particles is attributed to\nPN 2 \u2212N\nPN\nthe total-energy H = \u03b5 = n=1 Hnn + n6=m Hnm . The energy of the cross-correlating unit-fields is then given by\n0 \u2264 H \u2264 N 2 \u03b50 with the respective effective number 0 \u2264 N \u2264 N 2 of unit-fields. The interference and cross-correlation\nenergy of such unit-fields is associated with the first-order cross-correlation of the amplitude interferometry.\n6. THE PRESENT MODEL VERSUS TRADITIONAL ANALYSIS OF A MANY-PARTICLE SYSTEM\n\nThe following general analysis could make more transparent the methodology and philosophy of the present model\nbased on the non-quantum and quantum interference between particles and the respective cross-correlation energies.\nThe canonical quantum mechanics strictly forbids the existence of the interference between particles and the respective cross-correlation energy [a quantum particle interferes (correlates) only with itself]. The Hamiltonians of the\ncanonical quantum mechanics are invariant under the U (1) local gauge transformation (\u03c8n \u2192 \u03c8n\u2032 = ei\u03b1n \u03c8n ). The\nU (1) gauge symmetry provides the interference-less behavior of particles due to the independence of the canonical\nHamiltonians on the phases \u03b1n . In the \"modified\" quantum mechanics based on the Copenhagen-Dirac postulate\nof \"interference-less\", self interfering particles, the \"hidden\" interference between particles and the respective crosscorrelation energy are mediated by using the different powerful mathematical approximations, which do not compare\nwell with the basic physical principle (the Copenhagen-Dirac postulate of interference-less particles) of the traditional\nquantum mechanics and particle field theory. In such an approach, a mathematical wave-function of the quantum\nsystem is usually constructed mathematically as a product of the single-particle mathematical functions that crosscorrelate in the second or higher order yielding the mathematical cross-correlation (\"hidden\" interference) between\nparticles and the respective cross-correlation energy. The mathematical approach mediates the \"hidden\" interference and cross-correlation energy of particles [in the second-order or higher of the interference (cross-correlation)] in\nthe quantum mechanical multi-particle systems. Although the mathematically constructed trial Hamiltonians of the\n\"modified\" quantum mechanics are invariant under the U (1) local gauge transformation, the interference between\nparticles and the respective cross-correlation energy are provided mathematically by the second or higher order crosscorrelation functions, which do not depend on the values of the particle phases. That is to say that the U (1) gauge\nsymmetry of the trial Hamiltonians provides the very particular (in comparison to the ordinary interference) mathematical cross-correlation (\"hidden\" interference) and the respective cross-correlation energy, which do not depend\non the phases of the probability waves of particles. In such a case, the particles (wave-functions) can have absolutely\ndifferent phases providing the coherent quantum phenomena without the coherence of particles (wave-functions). That\nindicates that the cross-correlation (\"hidden\" interference) is provided rather by the mathematical approximation\nthan the large-scale classical or quantum coherence. For the sake of simplicity, the mathematical approach in the\nabove-considered models of the coherent quantum phenomena has been attributed to the Hartree-Fock approximation and mean-field theory (MFT). Nevertheless, one can easily demonstrate that the \"hidden\" interference between\nparticles and cross-correlation energy are mediated by other powerful mathematical approximations (approaches),\nsuch as the MFT extensions (e.g. Hartree-Fock and random phase approximations), many-body perturbation theory,\nGreen's function-based methods, configuration interaction, coupled cluster, various Monte-Carlo approaches, density\nfunctional theory, and lattice gauge theory. In the quantum field theory, the \"hidden\" interference between particles\n\n\f54\nand the respective cross-correlation energy are mathematically induced by the mathematical approximations associated with trial cross-correlating operators (the Bogoliubov-like operators). The mathematical construction of the\nantisymmetric state (function) in quantum mechanics or the canonical commutation relation for fermions in particle\nfield theory automatically yields the Fermi-Dirac statistics and Pauli exclusion principle, whose interpretations are\nusually mathematical ones. Modelling the boson gas by the symmetric state (function) or the use of the canonical\ncommutation relation of bosons leads mathematically to the Bose-Einstein statistics. Naturally, the interpretations of\nthe mathematical approximations could have the mathematical character. In the quantum mechanics and quantum\nfield theory based the Copenhagen-Dirac postulate of \"interference-less\" particles, the \"hidden\" interference, crosscorrelation and cross-correlation energy of particles appears as a result of interaction (\"hidden\" interference) of the\nparticles describing by the different approximate mathematical methods in the non-operator or operator form, which\nare inconsistent with the basic principle [a particle interferes (correlates) only with itself] of the canonical quantum\nmechanics and quantum field theory. The interpretations of the mathematical approximations are sometimes incorrectly considered as the physical interpretations of the \"modified\" quantum mechanics and particle field theory of the\nBose-Einstein condensation, superfluidity, superconductivity, supermagnetism, super-radiation, Bosenova effect, and\nquantum anomalous and fractional Hall effects. In the frame of such an approach, the coherent quantum phenomena\nare described by the phase-independent Hamiltonians. The physical mechanism behind the \"hidden\" interference and\ncross-correlation energy of particles is mediated by the different mathematical approximations, which do not compare well with the Copenhagen-Dirac postulate of \"interference-less\", self interfering particles. Thus the coherent\nquantum phenomena may be attributed formally even to the mathematical errors mediated by the mathematical\napproximations.\nA particle of the canonical quantum mechanics associated with the wave of probability is free from the interference\n(cross-correlation) with other particles. The above-discussed mathematical approach, which does not compare well\nwith the basic principle of canonical quantum mechanics and quantum field theory (the Copenhagen-Dirac postulate\nof \"interference-less\" particles\"), has been extremely useful for the construction (\"mathematical engineering\") of the\nmodels that successfully describe and explain the coherent quantum phenomena, such as the Bose-Einstein condensation, superfluidity, superconductivity, supermagnetism, super-radiation, Bosenova effect, and quantum anomalous\nand fractional Hall effects. Therefore this approximate mathematical approach was generally accepted in the past. It\nis very effectively used in the quantum mechanics and quantum field theory up to now. Although the mathematical\ncross-correlation (\"hidden\" interference) between particles and the respective cross-correlation energy are closely connected with the mathematical approximations, these theories rely on a set of approximations specific to the particular\nphysical problem. The \"hidden\" interference between particles and the cross-correlation energy have appeared in the\nquantum mechanics and particle field theory already at the very beginning of consideration of the physical problems\npertaining to the properties of quantum systems made of a large number of particles (many-body problem). The\n\"hidden\" interference and cross-correlation between particles do appear in the \"modified\" quantum mechanics and\nquantum field theory in the form of the interaction (cross-correlation) energy. It is impossible in the present study to\nanalyze a myriad of models of such quantum theories. The conventional approach of the mathematical insertion of\nthe \"hidden\" interference, cross-correlation energy, Bose-Einstein statistics, Fermi-Dirac statistics and Pauli exclusion\nprinciple into the canonical quantum mechanics and quantum field theory, which strictly forbid existence of the interference between particles and the respective cross-correlation energy, is illustrated by using the following traditional\n(typical) analysis of a many-particle quantum system.\nAs long as the number of particles of a non-relativistic quantum system is fixed the system can be described by a\nwave-function, which contains all the information about the state of that system. This is the so-called first quantization\napproach in the traditional analysis of a many-particle quantum system. The interaction-free (interference-less)\nparticles are described by the Schr\u00f6dinger equation of the canonical quantum mechanics of a single particle. The\nwave-functions \u03c8n (r) and \u03c8m (r) of the interaction-free particles must not correlate with each other in the points r:\nZ\n\u03c8n\u2217 (r)\u03c8m (r)d3 x \u2261 h\u03c8n (r)|\u03c8m (r)i = \u03b4nm ,\n(171)\nwhere \u03b4nm is the Kronecker delta. Notice, the value (171) providing the interference-less behavior of particles is equal\nto zero if the functions do not overlap spatially with each other or if they are orthogonal in the Hilbert space. The\nde Broglie wave [wave-function \u03c8n (r)]\nR associated with the n-th particle has a probabilistic interpretation in position\nspace. The values \u03c8n\u2217 (r)\u03c8n (r) and \u03c8n\u2217 (r)\u03c8n (r)d3 r = N = 1 are interpreted respectively as the probability (particle)\ndensity and the total number (N =1) of particles for the n-th particle. For the sake of simplicity, consider a system\ncomposed from two identical particles. In the case of the multi-particle (N > 2) quantum system, the consideration\nis the same as the analysis of two particles. The non-relativistic energy H of the interaction-free particles, which is a\n\n\f55\nsuperposition of the non-relativistic canonical Hamiltonians of the single particles, is given by the Hamiltonian\nH = H1 + H2 = h\u03c81 (r1 )|(p\u030221 /2m1 )|\u03c81 (r1 )i + h\u03c82 (r2 )|(p\u030222 /2m2 )|\u03c82 (r2 )i.\n\n(172)\n\nNotice, the Hamiltonian (172) of the interaction-less particles is invariant under the U (1) local gauge transformation\n(\u03c8n \u2192 \u03c8n\u2032 = ei\u03b1n \u03c8n ) giving rise to the interference-less behavior of particles. According to quantum theory, the\nparticles do not possess definite positions during the periods between measurements. Instead, they are governed by\nwave-functions that give the probability of finding a particle at each position. As time passes, the wave-functions\ntend to spread out and overlap. Once this happens, it becomes impossible to determine (distinguish), in a subsequent\nmeasurement, which of the particle positions correspond to those measured earlier. Intuitively, the quantum state\n[trial wave-function \u03a8(r1 , r2 )] of the system should be\n\u03a8(r1 , r2 ) = \u03c81 (r1 )\u03c82 (r2 )\n\n(173)\n\n\u03a8(r1 , r2 ) = \u03c81 (r2 )\u03c82 (r1 ),\n\n(174)\n\nor\n\nfor instance, see the pioneer studies [25] and [38]. The engineering of the trial wave-function is simply the canonical\nway of constructing a basis for a tensor product space from the individual spaces. We can use the functions (173)\nand (174) to form symmetric and antisymmetric functions of the system. The need for symmetric (bosonic) or\nantisymmetric (fermionic) states and functions is sometimes incorrectly regarded as an empirical fact. It turns out,\nfor the mathematical reasons ultimately based on quantum field theory, that we must have the exchange symmetric\nstates\n\u03a8(r1 , r2 ) = \u03c81 (r1 )\u03c82 (r2 ) \u00b1 \u03c81 (r2 )\u03c82 (r1 ),\n\n(175)\n\nwhich includes the exchange of coordinates r1 and r2 (not virtual particles). The states, where this is a sum, are\nknown as symmetric; the states involving the difference are called antisymmetric. If \u03c81 (r) and \u03c82 (r) are the same\n[\u03c81 (r1 ) = \u03c82 (r1 ) and \u03c81 (r2 ) = \u03c82 (r2 )], the antisymmetric expression gives zero. The same result is obtained if\n\u03c81 (r1 ) = \u03c81 (r2 ) and \u03c82 (r2 ) = \u03c82 (r1 ). In other words, in an antisymmetric state, two identical particles cannot\noccupy the same single-particle states. That is sometimes interpreted as the Pauli exclusion principle, which describes\ndisappearance (annihilation) of both the wave-function [\u03a8(r1 , r2 ) = 0] and the object composed from the two identical\nparticles. Note, in this regard, that Wolfgang Pauli has never considered the exclusion principle as the above-described\nannihilation (disappearance) of the identical particles. The question \"Why are the particles identical?\" is usually\ninterpreted as a wrong one, because the question arises from mistakenly regarding individual particles as fundamental\nobjects, when in fact it is only the particle (quantum) field is fundamental. The trial Hamiltonian of the system\ndescribing by the mathematically constructed functions (173), (174) or (175) can be written by using the trial wavefunction \u03a8(r1 , r2 ), for instance, in the form\nH = H1 + H2 + [H12 + H21 ] = h\u03a8(r1 , r2 )|(p\u030221 /2m1 + p\u030221 /2m1 )|\u03a8(r1 , r2 )i + h\u03a8(r1 , r2 )|U (|r1 \u2212 r2 |)|\u03a8(r1 , r2 )i, (176)\nwhich is different from the Hamiltonian (172) of the interaction-less particles. Therefore, the new term H12 + H21 =\nh\u03a8(r1 , r2 )|U (|r1 \u2212 r2 |)|\u03a8(r1 , r2 )i is usually interpreted as the potential energy of the interaction of particles with each\nother. Notice, the interaction term in the form h\u03a8(r1 , r2 )|U (|r1 \u2212 r2 |)|\u03a8(r1 , r2 )i can include also the potential energy\nassociated with the interaction of particles with the external macroscopic field [for instance, see Eqs. (144)-(146)].\nAlthough the wave-functions \u03c81 (r) and \u03c82 (r) do not cross-correlate (interfere) with each other, in agreement with\nthe canonical quantum mechanics [see, Eqs. (171) and (172)], the \"hidden\" interference, cross-correlation and the\ncross-correlation energy H12 + H21 do appear in the \"modified\" quantum mechanics in the form of the interaction\nintegrals\nZ Z\nH12 + H21 \u223c\n\u03c81\u2217 (r1 )\u03c82\u2217 (r2 )U (|r1 \u2212 r2 |)\u03c81 (r1 )\u03c82 (r2 )d3 x1 d3 x2 ,\n(177)\nor\nH12 + H21 \u223c\n\nZ Z\n\n\u03c81\u2217 (r2 )\u03c82\u2217 (r1 )U (|r1 \u2212 r2 |)\u03c81 (r2 )\u03c82 (r1 )d3 x1 d3 x2 ,\n\n(178)\n\n\f56\nin the case of the trial wave-functions (173) or (174), respectively. The more complicated trial wave-function (175)\nyields the interaction energy that includes the terms (177) and (178) and the Heisenberg-Dirac exchange integrals\nZ Z\n\u223c\n\u03c81\u2217 (r1 )\u03c82\u2217 (r2 )U (|r1 \u2212 r2 |)\u03c81 (r2 )\u03c82 (r1 )d3 x1 d3 x2\n(179)\nand\n\u223c\n\nZ Z\n\n\u03c81\u2217 (r2 )\u03c82\u2217 (r1 )U (|r1 \u2212 r2 |)\u03c81 (r1 )\u03c82 (r2 )d3 x1 d3 x2 .\n\n(180)\n\nNotice, the object describing by the antisymmetric function (state) (175) composed from the identical (\u03c81 = \u03c82 )\nparticles does annihilate, because the wave-function \u03a8 and the total energy (176) do vanish. Although this phenomenon is usually interpreted as the Pauly exclusion principle, the Pauly principle was originally formulated without\ninvolving annihilation of the identical particles. According to the usual interpretations of the \"modified\" quantum\nmechanics, the coordinate-exchange integrals describe the quantum exchange of particles associated with the indistinguishableness of the identical particles. Although the trial Hamiltonian (176) is invariant under the U (1) local gauge\ntransformation (\u03c8n \u2192 \u03c8n\u2032 = ei\u03b1n \u03c8n ), the mathematical cross-correlation (\"hidden\" interference) between particles\nand the respective cross-correlation energy, which do not depend on the particle phases \u03b1n , are provided by the interaction integrals of this Hamiltonian. The interference and cross-correlation of the fields \u03c81 (r) and \u03c82 (r) in the trial\nHamiltonian (176) are especially transparent in the case of U (|r1 \u2212 r2 |) = (g/2)\u03b4(|r1 \u2212 r2 |), where g is the coupling\nparameter that represents the inter-particle interaction (interference), for instance, in the Gross-Pitaevski model of the\nBose-Einstein condensate [see, Eqs. (146) and (147)]. In such a case, the interference and cross-correlation between\nparticles do appear\nin the \"modified\" quantum mechanics in the form of the cross-correlation (interaction) energy\nR\nH12 + H21 \u223c [\u03c81\u2217 (r)\u03c82 (r)][\u03c82\u2217 (r)\u03c81 (r)]d3 x 6= 0 with the second-order cross-correlation in the same (r1 = r2 = r)\npoints r1 and r2 . One could compare this expression with Eq. (171), which describes the interference-free and\ncorrelation-free particles. The value (171) providing the interference-less behaviour of particles does vanish if the\nfunctions do not overlap spatially with each other or if they are orthogonal in the Hilbert space. If the interaction\npotential is constant (for instance, U (|r1 \u2212 r2 |) = 1), then the interference and cross-correlation energy do appear in\nthe \"modified\" quantum mechanics in the form of the cross-correlation integrals (177), (178), (179) and (180) with\nU (|r1 \u2212r2 |) = 1, which contain the second-order cross-correlation (interference) in the different (r1 6= r2 ) points r1 and\nr2 , but do not contain directly the potential value. Thus in the above-described \"modified\" quantum mechanics, which\ndoes not compare well with the basic quantum mechanical principle [a particle interferes (correlates) only with itself],\nthe interference and cross-correlation of particles do appear in the second-order of interference (cross-correlation) in\nthe same and/or different space points. The U (1) gauge symmetry of the trial Hamiltonian (176) provides the very\nparticular mathematical cross-correlation (\"hidden\" interference) and the respective cross-correlation energy, which\ndo not depend on the phases of the probability waves of particles. The mathematical \"engineering\" of the symmetric\nor antisymmetric state [the trial mathematical wave-function associated with the waves of probability of the identical (indistinguishable) particles] yields automatically the Bose-Einstein statistics or the Fermi-Dirac correlations\n(statistics) and the Pauli exclusion principle, whose interpretations are mathematical ones. The trial mathematical\nwave-function of two identical particles is symmetric or antisymmetric with respect to the permutation of the two\nparticles, depending whether one considers bosons or fermions. In a particular case of the non-identical particles\nthere is no permutation symmetry. Consequently there should be no Bose-Einstein or Fermi-Dirac correlation between these particles. In the trial wave-function formalism, the difference between particles could be attributed only\nto the difference in mass and/or charge. The difference in the spin of bosons or fermions results respectively into\nthe Bose-Einstein or Fermi-Dirac cross-correlations (statistics). Note again that the interpretations of the model are\nalso based on interpretations of the mathematical approximations, which are inconsistent with the basic principle\n[a particle interferes (correlates) only with itself] of canonical quantum mechanics. It should be also noted that in\ncondensed matter physics, the quantum states with ill-defined particle numbers are particularly important for describing the various superfluids. Many of the defining characteristics of a superfluid arise from the notion that its\nquantum state is a superposition of states (wave-functions) with different particle numbers N . For instance, the\nconcept of a coherent quantum state used to model the laser and the BCS ground state refers to a state with an\nill-defined particle number but a well-defined phase. In the present model, the cross-correlation (interaction) integral\nh\u03a8(r1 , r2 )|U (|r1 \u2212 r2 |)|\u03a8(r1 , r2 )i is associated with the cross-correlation energy H12 + H21 induced by the interference (cross-correlation) of the unit-fields \u03c81 (r) and \u03c82 (r) of the real physical matter [see, Secs. (2)-(5)]. The physical\nmechanism behind the Bose-Einstein statistics, Fermi-Dirac statistics and Pauli exclusion principle is attributed to the\nattractive and repulsive forces associating with the subtractive and additive interference (cross-correlation) of the real\nunit-waves (bosons or fermions) of the physical matter. The additive and subtractive interference (the repulsive and\n\n\f57\nattractive forces) correspond to the fermion and boson unit-waves, respectively. The time-averaged cross-correlation\nenergy (141) of the incoherent unit-fields having random phases is equal to zero due to the non-correlation of such\nfields. The increase of the degree of coherence (phase correlation) increases the time-averaged cross-correlation energy\nof the partially coherent unit-fields. The cross-correlation energy (141) averaged over the time \u2206t >> 1/\u2206\u03b50nm does\nvanish if the coherent unit-fields (particles) with the constant phases \u03b1n and \u03b1m are non-identical (k0n 6= k0m and/or\nm0n 6= m0m , respectively \u03b50n 6= \u03b50m ). The property gives the physical explanation of the identity or non-identity of\nthe unit-fields (particles). The coherency of the identical unit-fields (particles) is the necessary condition of existence\nof the cross-correlation energy.\nConsider now the above-presented mathematical construction (\"engineering\") of the multi-particle quantum mechanical system also from a point of view of quantum field theory. Particle field theory deals with quantum systems\nwhere particles and antiparticles are created and destroyed. The description of the systems with the non fixed number\nof the particles demands a more general theoretical approach called second quantization. In quantum field theory,\nunlike in quantum mechanics, position is not an observable, and thus, one does not need the concept of a positionspace probability density. The wave-function \u03c8n (r) does not have a probabilistic interpretation in position space. The\nquantum mechanical system is considered as a quantum field. The field elementary degrees of freedom are the occupation numbers, and each occupation number is indexed by a number n, indicating which of the single-particle states\n\u03c81 , \u03c82 , ..., \u03c8n , ..., \u03c8N it refers to. In the above-described \"modified\" quantum mechanics, which does not compare well\nwith the Copenhagen-Dirac quantummechanical principles, the trial Hamiltonian describing the multi-particle system\nin space representation is given by\nH = (\u22121/2m)\n\nN Z\nX\n\nn=1\n\n\u03c8n\u2217 (rn )\u22072n \u03c8n (rn )d3 xn\n\n+\n\n2\nNX\n\u2212N\n\nn6=m\n\nZ Z\n\n\u2217\n\u03c8n\u2217 (rn )\u03c8m\n(rm )U (|rn \u2212 rm |)\u03c8n (rn )\u03c8m (rm )d3 xn d3 xm ,(181)\n\nwhere the indexes n and m run over all particles [also, see Eqs. (144) - (146) and (176)]. In the quantum field theory,\nthe respective trial Hamiltonian is given by\nZ\nZ Z\n\u2217\n2\n3\nH = (\u22121/2m) \u03a8 (r)\u2207 \u03a8(r)d x +\n\u03a8\u2217 (r)\u03a8\u2217 (r\u2032 )U (|r \u2212 r\u2032 |)\u03a8(r)\u03a8(r\u2032 )d3 xd3 x\u2032 ,\n(182)\nwhich looks like an expression for the expectation value of the energy, with \u03a8 playing the role of the trial wavefunction. The properties of this field are explored mathematically by defining creation (\u00e2\u2020 ) and annihilation (\u00e2)\nquantum operators with the commutation relations imposed, which add and subtract particles. This is the second\nquantization approach. The field is considered as a set of degrees of freedom indexed by position, where the second\nquantization indexes the field by enumerating the single-particle quantum states. The second quantization procedure\nrelies on the particles being identical. It is impossible to construct mathematically a quantum field theory from\na distinguishable many-particle system, because there would be no way of separating and indexing the degrees of\nfreedom. From the point of view of the above-described quantum field model, the particles are identical if and only if\nthey are excitations of the same quantum field. Such an interpretation is the mathematical interpretation of the trial\nmathematical object, which contradicts the basic principles of canonical quantum mechanics. Remember, the question\n\"Why are the particles identical in quantum mechanics?\" is usually incorrectly interpreted as a wrong one, because\nthe question arises from mistakenly regarding individual particles as fundamental objects, when in fact it is only the\nfield (trial mathematical object constructed by using the different mathematical approximations) that is fundamental.\nMathematically, the second quantization of the field is performed by placing the trial fields \u03a8 and \u03a8\u2217 into the infinite\nresonator and subsequent replacement of these fields by the respective multimode field operators \u03a8\u0302 and \u03a8\u0302\u2020 . Thus the\ntrial Hamiltonian (182) of the trial quantum field can be rewritten in terms of the trial field of operators by using\nthe creation and annihilation operators. In such a case, the \"hidden\" inter-particle interference and the respective\ninteraction energy are provided rather by the trial cross-correlating operators (mathematical objects) with the trial\n(Bogoliubov-like) commutator relations for the particles and antiparticles [the observable bosons and fermions or\nthe virtual gauge bosons associated with the gauge field U (|r \u2212 r\u2032 |) and the gauge symmetry breaking] than by the\ninterference of the waves of probabilities associated with the single-particle functions \u03c8n (rn ) and \u03c8m (rm ). That is to\nsay that the mathematical cross-correlation between particles and the respective cross-correlation energy are mediated\nby the mathematical cross-correlation between the operators in the interaction integrals of the trial Hamiltonian\noperator. The trial Hamiltonian (182) and the respective Hamiltonian operator are invariant under the U (1) local\ngauge transformation given rise to the very particular mathematical cross-correlation (\"hidden\" interference) and the\nrespective energy, which do not depend on the particle phases. The mathematical construction of Hamiltonians for\nbosons and fermions by using the respective trial commutator relations automatically yields the particle interference,\n\n\f58\ncross-correlation (interaction) energy, particle number, Bose-Einstein statistics, Fermi-Dirac correlations (statistics)\nand Pauli exclusion principle. If one considers the possibility that non-identical particles are virtually related in the\nsense that they can annihilate and transform into identical particles, there should be a new kind of the Bose-Einstein\nor Fermi-Dirac correlations (statistics). Note again that the interpretations of the above-presented quantum-field\nmodel are based on interpretations of the mathematical approximations, which do not compare well with the basic\nprinciple [a particle interferes (correlates) only with itself] of canonical quantum mechanics and quantum field theory.\nUnfortunately, in the frame of such an approach, some \"physical\" interpretations may be attributed formally even to\nthe interpretations of the pure mathematical errors mediated by the mathematical approximations. In the present\nmodel, the cross-correlation terms in Eqs. (181) and (182) are considered as the cross-correlation energies mediated\nby the interference and cross-correlation between the particles (unit-fields) of the physical matter [see, Secs. (2)-(5)].\nThe physical mechanism behind the Bose-Einstein statistics, Fermi-Dirac statistics and Pauli exclusion principle is\nattributed to the attractive and repulsive forces associating with the subtractive and additive interference (crosscorrelation) of the unit-waves (bosons or fermions) of the real physical substance (mass-energy). The additive and\nsubtractive interference (the repulsive and attractive forces) correspond to the identical fermion and boson unit-waves,\nrespectively. The interference of non-identical particles or antiparticles (unit-waves) should result into a new kind\nof the Bose-Einstein or Fermi-Dirac correlations (statistics), namely the correlations between non-identical particles\n(unit-waves). Notice, the cross-correlation energy (141) averaged over the time \u2206t >> 1/\u2206\u03b50nm does vanish if the\ncoherent unit-fields (particles) with the constant phases \u03b1n and \u03b1m are non-identical (k0n 6= k0m and/or m0n 6= m0m ,\nrespectively \u03b50n 6= \u03b50m ).\nIt should be stressed that the \"modified\" quantum mechanics and the particle field theory based on the \"hidden\"\ninterference between particles and the respective cross-correlation energy inserting into the models by the different\npowerful mathematical approximations have been constructed to give absolutely correct description and explanation of\nthe basic coherent quantum phenomena, such as the particle interference (cross-correlation), cross-correlation energy,\ninteraction, particle number, Bose-Einstein statistics, Fermi-Dirac statistics and Pauli exclusion principle. Naturally,\nthese theories give also the correct description and interpretation of the extraordinary coherent physical phenomena,\nsuch as the Bose-Einstein condensation, super-radiation, Bosenova effect, superfluidity, superconductivity, supermagnetism, and quantum anomalous and fractional Hall effects. The Hamiltonians of the models are invariant under the\nU (1) local gauge transformation providing the very particular, in comparison to the ordinary interference, mathematical cross-correlation (\"hidden\" interference) and the respective cross-correlation energy, which do not depend on the\nparticle phases. Such a mathematical approach (\"mathematical engineering\"), which has been generally accepted in\nthe very past, is effectively used in the quantum mechanics and quantum field theory up to now. The present model\ncould be considered as a generalization of the \"modified\" quantum mechanics and particle field theory by taking\ninto account rather the real, direct, physical interference between material unit-fields (particles) and the interferenceinduced energy than the \"hidden\", approximation-induced mathematical interference between the non-material waves\nof probabilities or operators associated with material point-like particles and the respective cross-correlation (interaction) energy. In the frame of the present model, the hypothetical \"hidden\" variable of Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen\n[10], which according to the authors should be added to the canonical quantum mechanics to avoid its indeterminism\nand superluminal signalling, cold be attributed to the \"non-hidden\", physical interference between material unit-fields.\n7. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nIn Part I of the present study, the interference between material unit-fields (particles) and the interference-induced\npositive and negative cross-correlation energies, which do not exist from the point of view of both the Newton\nmechanics, Einstein relativity, canonical quantum mechanics and particle field theory, have been investigated. In\norder to make the results understandable not only to specialists in the research field, the model concepts where\nanalyzed and reanalyzed in the context of each section of Secs. (1)-(7). In the model, for both the classical and\nquantum fields, the two-times increase of the wave amplitude does increase the wave energy in four times, and the\nwave with zero amplitude has zero energy. The problem of nonconservation of the energy and number of particles\nby the cross-correlation was overcame by taking into consideration the fact that creation of the conditions of the\npure additive or subtractive interference of the waves (fields) requires \"additional\" energy that must be added or\nsubtracted from the physical system. Then the \"additional\" energy does provide conservation of the total energy of\nthe system. The Hamiltonians that describe the energy inducing by the cross-correlation (interference) in the basic\nclassical and quantum fields have been derived. The conditions of pure constructive or destructive interference were\nfound by using these Hamiltonians. The influence of the cross-correlation energy on the basic physical properties\nof boson and fermion fields was demonstrated. The energy, mass, charge, and momentum of the interfering fields\n\n\f59\nwere calculated. The calculated energy \u03b50 = \u03c90 = (k20 + m20 )1/2 of a unit-field (particle) is equal to the PlanckEinstein energy of the particle, but is different from the value \u03b50 = \u03c90 + (1/2)\u03c90 of traditional quantum field\ntheory. The positive energy-mass \u03b50 = (k20 + m20 )1/2 of antiparticles in the present model is different from the\nnegative energy-mass of the Dirac antiparticles in the Dirac model, which is based on the Dirac interpretation of\nquantum interference and the particle (antiparticle) energy-mass relation \u03b50 = \u00b1(k20 + m20 )1/2 . The calculated vacuum\nenergy, in agreement with the Einstein and classical physics of the empty space, is equal to zero. Here, one should\nnot confuse the true vacuum of the Einstein or Newton model with the physical vacuum of the present model\noccupied by the interfering finite and infinite unite-fields. The Copenhagen interpretation (philosophy) of the de\nBroglie wave associated with a particle as the wave of probability presents a more or less intuitively transparent\nbackground for the physical interpretation of quantum mechanics. In particle field theory, up to now, it is not\ncompletely clear how to interpret physically the wave (field) of operators. In the present model, the unit-wave\nassociated with a boson or fermion particle, unlike the wave of probability or operators in quantum mechanics and\nparticle field theory, is a real, finite unit-wave (unit-field) of the boson or fermion matter (mass-energy), whose\ncurvature (gradient) can be changed spatially and/or temporally. The physical mechanism behind the positionmomentum and time-energy uncertainties is attributed to the increase of the spatial (\u2207\u03c80 ) and/or temporal (\u2202\u03c80 /\u2202t)\ncurvatures (gradients) of a real, material unit-field under the spatial or temporal localization of the unit-field by\nthe interaction (interference) with the unit-fields (particles ) of other microscopical or macroscopical objects. In\norder to account for the well-known discrepancies between measurements based on the mass of the visible matter in\nastronomy and cosmology and definitions of the energy (mass) made through dynamical or general relativistic means,\nthe present model does not need in hypothesizing the existence of \"dark\" energy-mass. In the present model, the \"dark\"\ncosmological energy as well as the well-known spiral cosmological structures are associated with the cross-correlation\nenergy of the moving cosmological objects. According to the present model, the Bell superluminal signals [11] (the\nEinstein-Podolsky-Rosen paradox) and the well-known superluminal objects in astronomy, if they really propagate\nwith velocities greater than the velocity of light, involve no physics incompatible with the theory of special relativity.\nThe superluminar velocities and the superluminar \"quantum leaps\" of any kind are attributed rather to the physical\nproperties of the unit-field like material mediums than the empty space (vacuum) of the Einstein special or general\nrelativity. It has been also shown that the positive or negative gradient of the cross-correlation energy does mediate the\nattractive or repulsive forces, respectively. These forces could be attributed to all known classical and quantum fields\n(interactions), for instance, to the gravitational and Coulomb fields. In the present model, the physical mechanism\nbehind the Bose-Einstein statistics, Fermi-Dirac statistics and Pauli exclusion principle is attributed to the attractive\nand repulsive forces associating with the subtractive and additive interference (cross-correlation) of the unit-waves\n(bosons or fermions) of the real physical matter. If the interference of unit-fields is neither pure constructive nor pure\ndestructive (the interaction is not repulsive or attractive), then the respective statistics are different from the FermiDirac or Bose-Einstein statistics. Such parastatistics could be associated, for instance, with the so-called fractional\nand braid statistics. To this end, the model showed a key role of the cross-correlation energy in several basic physical\nphenomena, such as Bose-Einstein condensation, super-radiation, Bosenova effect, superfluidity, superconductivity,\nsupermagnetism, and quantum anomalous and fractional Hall effects.\nIn the \"modified\" quantum mechanics and particle field theories, the mathematical cross-correlation (\"hidden\"\ninterference) is associated with the pure mathematical approximations, which do not compare well with the basic\nphysical principle (the Copenhagen-Dirac postulate of interference-less particles) of the canonical versions of these\ntheories. Physically, the \"hidden\" interference is interpreted as the inter-particle interaction associated with the\ninteraction energy. The present model could be considered as a generalization of the \"modified\" quantum mechanics and\nparticle field theory. The generalization is performed by taking into account rather the real, direct, physical interference\nbetween material unit.fields and the interference-induced energy than the \"hidden\", mathematical interference between\nnon-material waves of probabilities or operators associated with the material point-like particles and the respective\ncross-correlation energy. The general properties of the forces mediated by the gradients of cross-correlation energy\nunder the interference between particles (unit-fields) have been illustrated by the numerical solutions for the pairs of\nscalar boson unit-fields. One can easily follow the model for an arbitrary number of the boson or fermion unit-fields (for\nan example, for the particles or antiparticles of the Standard Model of Particle Physics) with the arbitrary values of the\nrest masses m0n , charges q0n and spins s0n of the unit-fields, as well as for the composite fields composed from both the\nboson and fermion unit-fields. The concept of the interference between particles and the interference-induced energy\nmay be easily extended to other quantum field theories. For instance, if one assumes that quantum particles are not\nzero-dimensional objects of the traditional quantum mechanics or particle field theories, but rather one-dimensional\nstrings of the String Theory that can move and vibrate, giving the observed particles the physical properties, the crosscorrelation and the cross-correlation energy could be attributed to the interference of the vibrations in the overlapped\nstrings. It should be stressed in this regard that the unit-fields of the present model are not the point particles\n\n\f60\nor strings. The unit-fields have simultaneously the properties of the point particles, strings and 3-dimensional (in\nspace) waves. A quasi-unified description of the classical and quantum fields and interactions, which does not include\ngravity, is currently possible only in terms of the gauge symmetry breaking in the Standard Model of Particle Physics\n(SM). The present study (Part I) has developed the theoretical background for unified description of the all-known\nclassical and quantum fields and interactions. The background is provided in the extremely trivial (in comparison to\nSM) manner, namely in terms of the interference, cross-correlation and cross-correlation energy of the 3-dimensional\nunit-fields. The next study (Part II) unifies the all-known classical and quantum fields, particles and interactions\n(including gravitation) by using this theoretical background. The unification is performed by the direct generalization\nof the Einstein relativistic energy-mass relation \u03b52 = k2 + m2 for the interfering particles (bodies). The unit-fields\nhave simultaneously properties of the point particles and waves of quantum mechanics, the point particles of SM, the\nstrings of theory of strings and the 3-dimensional waves of theory of classical fields. Therefore the unification of fields\nand interactions is considered as a generalization of the classical and quantum field theories, SM and string theory.\nAcknowledgments\n\nThe study was supported in part by the Framework for European Cooperation in the field of Scientific and Technical\nResearch (COST, Contract No MP0601) and the Hungarian Research and Development Program (KPI, Contract\nGVOP 0066-3.2.1.-2004-04-0166/3.0).\n\n[1] M.

Unification of Classical and Quantum Fields and Interactions\nS. V. Kukhlevsky\nDepartment of Physics, Faculty of Natural Sciences,\nUniversity of Pecs, Ifjusag u. 6, H-7624 Pecs, Hungary\nA quasi-unified description of the classical and quantum fields, which defines the electromagnetic, weak and strong\ninteractions, but does not include gravity, is currently possible only in the frame of the Standard Model of Particle\nPhysics (SM) in terms of the gauge symmetry breaking. Part I of the present study has developed the theoretical\nbackground for unified description of the all-known classical and quantum fields in terms of the interference between\nparticles and the respective cross-correlation energy, which do not exist from the point of view of quantum mechanics\nand SM.

The unification is performed by generalization of the Einstein energy-mass relation \u03b52 = k2 + m2\nfor the interfering unit-fields associated with the interacting particles. The unit-fields obey properties of the point\nparticles and waves of quantum mechanics, the point particles of SM, the strings of theories of strings and the 3-D\nwaves of theories of classical fields.\n\n1. INTRODUCTION\n\nA generally accepted quasi-unified description of the classical and quantum fields, which defines the electromagnetic,\nweak, and strong interactions, but does not include gravity, is currently provided by the Standard Model of Particle\nPhysics (SM) in terms of the gauge symmetry relations and the gauge symmetry breaking. SM is based on the three\nindependent gauge interactions, symmetries and coupling constants, which do associate with the electromagnetic, weak\nand strong interactions of particles. There are several similar candidate models (so-called Grand Unified Theories) in\nwhich at high energy, the three gauge interactions of SM are merged into one single interaction characterized by one\nlarger gauge symmetry and thus one unified coupling constant. Some models, which exhibit similar properties, do not\nunify all interactions using one simple Lie group as the gauge symmetry, but do so using semi-simple groups or other\nsuper-symmetries. Grand Unified Theories are considered as an intermediate step towards the so-called a Theory of\nEverything that would unify gravity with the electromagnetic, weak, and strong interactions. For an example, the\nString Theory is currently considered as a candidate for a Theory of Everything. For the detailed description of the\naforementioned generally-accepted models and candidate theories see the canonical studies and traditional textbooks,\nas well as any modern paper, review paper or textbook published in huge amount in the literature devoted to the\nquantum fields and interactions (for instance, see Refs. [1\u201338] and references therein).\nPart I of the present study has developed the theoretical background for a unified description of the classical and\nquantum fields and interactions in terms of the interference between elementary particles (indivisible unit-fields) and\nthe respective cross-correlation energy, which do not exist from the point of view of the canonical quantum mechanics,\nquantum field theories, SM and string theories. The Hamiltonians that describe the cross-correlation energy mediating\nby interference of the basic classical and quantum fields composed from the 3-dimensional (in space) unit-fields of real\nphysical matter (mass-energy) have been derived by the generalization of the traditional Hamiltonians of the classical\n\n\f62\nand quantum field theories for the superposition of interfering unit-fields associated with the interacting particles.\nIt has been shown that the gradient of the cross-correlation energy induced by the interference between particles\n(unit-fields) mediates the attractive or repulsive forces, which could be attributed to all known classical and quantum\nfields (for details, see Part I). Part II of the present study uses this theoretical background for unified description of\nthe fundamental (electromagnetic, weak, strong and gravitational) fields and interactions. However, unlike in Part I,\nthe unification is performed rather by the generalization of the basic (energy-mass) relation of the Einstein special\nrelativity than the traditional Hamiltonians of the classical and quantum field theories. The model unifies the allknown fields, particles and interactions by the straightforward generalization of the Einstein relativistic energy-mass\nrelation \u03b52 = k2 +m2 for the interacting particles and bodies, which are composed from the interfering, indivisible unitfields associated with the elementary particles. The unit-fields have simultaneously properties of the point particles\nand waves of quantum mechanics (particle-wave duality), the point particles of SM, the strings of theories of strings\nand the 3-D (in space) waves of theories of classical fields. Therefore the unification of the fundamental fields and\ninteractions is considered as the further development and generalization of the canonical quantum mechanics, classical\nand quantum field theories, SM and string theories.\nPart II is organized as follows. Section 1 provides a brief introduction to the problem associated with the unification\nof classical and quantum fields and interactions. In order to make the unification of the fields, particles and interactions\nunderstandable to non-experts in the research field, the unification in Part II is performed in many philosophical,\nmathematical and physical details. The model concepts are reanalyzed in the mathematical context of each section.\nSection 2 summarizes and briefly interprets the basic physical concepts of SM emphasizing the methodological and\nphilosophical aspects of this model. Then these concepts are compared with the physical principles of the present\nmodel. Section 3 presents a single elementary particle as a single unit-field. Unification of a single elementary particle\nand a single unit-field is performed by the generalization of the Einstein energy-mass relation \u03b52 = k2 +m2 for the single\nunit-field. The interacting elementary particles of a multi-particle system and the interfering (cross-correlating) unitfields are unified in Sec. 4. The unification is performed by generalization of the Einstein energy-mass relation for the\ninterfering unit-fields associated with the interacting particles. Section 5 describes the internal structures [generators\nand associate components (ACs)] of a unit-field associated with fundamental (gravitational, electromagnetic, weak and\nstrong) fields. The interference (interaction) of the structured unit-fields (elementary particles) having the arbitrary\ngenerators and the associate components is considered in Sec. 6. In order to make the general equations of Sec. 6 more\ntransparent, Sec. 7 analysis the interference (interaction) of the unit-fields (particles) having the concrete generators\nand associate components of the unit-fields, namely the de Broglie generators and the total associate components\ncontaining the spherically symmetric Laplace ACs and Helmholtz ACs. Section 7 unifies the unit-fields corresponding\nto the experimentally observed particles obeying the different combinations of the gravitational, electromagnetic,\nweak and strong interactions. The results of unification of the all-known elementary particles and interactions are\nsummarized in Sec. 8.\n2. BASIC CONCEPTS OF THE PRESENT MODEL VERSUS STANDARD MODEL\n\nThe basic physical concepts (principles) of the present model of the unified fields, elementary particles and interactions are different from the Standard Model of Particle Physics. The standard model is usually interpreted as one of\nthe most complicated physical models, which is based on the sophisticated gauge symmetry relations and the gauge\nsymmetry breaking. In the present model, the unification of the all-known classical and quantum fields, particles\nand interactions is performed in the extremely simple and transparent manner, namely in terms of the interference\nbetween particles (unit-fields) and the respective cross-correlation energy, which do not exist from the point of view\nof SM. Before the unification of fields, particles and interactions let me summarize and briefly interpret the basic\nphysical concepts of SM emphasizing the methodological and philosophical aspects of this model [Sec. (2.1.)]. Then\nthese concepts will be compared with the physical concepts of the present model [Sec. (2.2.)].\n2.1. Basic concepts of Standard Model of Particle Physics\n\nThe four known fundamental interactions of nature, all of which are non-contact forces, are electromagnetism, weak\ninteraction, strong interaction and gravitation. The Standard Model provides a quasi-unified description of the classical\nand quantum fields, which define the electromagnetic, weak and strong interactions, but does not include gravity.\nSM is usually considered as the final outcome of quantum field theory combining the basic physical conceptions\nof canonical quantum mechanics with the special relativity [1\u201322]. In the generally-accepted form, SM has been\n\n\f63\ndeveloped around 1968 by Sheldon Glashow, Abdus Salam and Steven Weinberg (for instance, see the studies [23\u201330]\nand references therein). SM describes nature except gravity in terms of the fundamental material fields, e.g., the fields\nfor the respective elementary particles. The elementary particle of the respective fundamental (global) field, which\nis infinite in space, is associated with the field \"quanta\". An elementary particle [a quanta of matter (energy-mass)]\nof the fundamental material field is assumed not to be made up of smaller particles. In other words, an elementary\nparticle does not has a substructure. The quarks, anti-quarks, leptons, anti-leptons and gauge bosons are elementary\nparticles, the building blocks of the gravity-less matter in SM. All other particles are made from these elementary\nparticles. Quarks (up, down, charm, strange, top, bottom) and Leptons (electron neutrino, electron, muon neutrino,\nmuon, tau neutrino, tau) are fermions. The respective anti-quarks and anti-leptons are also fermions. Gauge bosons\n(photon, W -boson, Z-boson, gluon, Higgs boson) naturally are bosons. The elementary particles are modelled in\nSM as point (0-D) particles, although some other theories posit a physical dimension. For instance, in the String\nTheory, particles are one-dimensional (1-D) strings that can move and vibrate, giving the physical properties to the\nelementary particles.\nIn the conceptual picture of the SM fundamental interactions (interactive forces), the gravitation-less physical\nmatter consists of the aforementioned (0-D) point-like fermions, which carry properties of charges and intrinsic angular\nmomentums (half-integer spins s = \u00b11/2). The interactive forces are the ways that the fermions interact with one\nanother by means of the electromagnetic, weak-nuclear and strong-nuclear forces having the non-contact nature.\nPhenomenologically (macroscopically), the forces acting upon a fermion particle are seen as action of the respective\nboson field that is present at the particle location. The electromagnetic, weak-nuclear and strong-nuclear forces are\nassociated with electromagnetic, weak-nuclear and strong-nuclear fields. Microscopically, the electromagnetic, strong\nand weak interactions between fermions are described in terms of the mathematical approximation method known\nas perturbation theory. The point fermions separated by the true vacuum (\"straight\" empty spacetime of Einstein\nspecial relativity) attract or repel each other by the force mediating by the virtual exchange of the respective gauge\npoint bosons through the vacuum. The bosons are the virtual particles because they are created and exist only in\nthe exchange process. The exchange of bosons does transport momentum and energy between the fermions, thereby\nchanging their momentum and energy. The interaction results into attracting or repelling fermions characterizing\nby the interactive force that has the absolute value and direction. The exchange can also carry a charge between\nthe fermions, changing the charges of the fermions and turning them from one type of fermion to another. Finally,\nsince the point boson transports one unit of intrinsic angular momentum (spin s = \u00b11), the spin of the point fermion\ncan vary, for instance, from +1/2 to -1/2 under the boson exchange. It should be stressed that the microscopic\ninterpretation of the interactions using the mathematical approximations associated with the perturbation theory is\nrather a pure mathematical interpretation than physical one. Moreover, such an interpretation does not adequately\ndescribe some physical phenomena. For an example, the perturbation-based model does not compare well with the\nEinstein theory of general relativity. Indeed, one can assume that the non-contact gravitational interaction between\nparticles is provided by the Newton force, which is associated with the gravitational field mediated by the mass of\ninteracting particles. Then there should be hypothetical gravitons, the supersymmetric partners of the gauge bosons\nof SM, that would carry the gravitational force in the perturbation approximation of gravitational interaction. In the\nEinstein general relativity, however, the gravitational interaction between two particles is not viewed as a force, but\nrather particles moving freely in gravitational fields travel under their own inertia in straight lines through \"curve\"\nspacetime. Thus the force of gravity is considered as the result of the geometry of \"curve\" spacetime.\nOne can present also the slightly more detailed picture of the SM concepts associated with the fields, particles and\ninteractions. In SM the electromagnetism and weak interaction are considered as two different aspects of the same\nforce. The electromagnetism is the force (interaction) that acts between electrically charged fermions (quarks and\nleptons). The interaction acting between the fermions at rest is known as the electrostatic (Coulomb) force mediating\nby the electric field. The combined effect of electric forces acting between the fermions moving relative to each other\nis known as Lorentz's force inducing by the electric and magnetic fields. In the perturbation approximation of the\nelectromagnetic interaction, the carriers of the electromagnetic force are the virtual photons (mass-less gauge bosons)\nassociated with the electric charge of quarks and leptons. In the frame of the Heisenberg energy uncertainty relation\nand the perturbation approximation, the long range of the electromagnetic interaction is attributed to absence of the\nrest mass of photons. The field strength of the electromagnetic interaction is adjusted in SM by the electromagnetic\ncoupling constant. The electromagnetism is called the quantum electrodynamics. The weak interaction (weak nuclear\nforce), which affects all known fermions (quarks and leptons), is considered as being caused by the simultaneous\nemission and absorption (virtual exchange) of the W and Z virtual gauge bosons (massive particles). The typical\nfield strength of the week interaction, which is adjusted by the respective (electro-week) coupling constant, is several\norders of magnitude less than that of both electromagnetism and the strong nuclear force. The short range of the\nweak interaction is attributed to the heaviness of W and Z bosons. In contrast to the other interactions, the weak\n\n\f64\ninteraction may change not only the energy, momentum and spin of fermions, but also the quark flavor from one of\nsix to another. The weak interaction, which is left-right asymmetric, does conserve CPT, but violates CP symmetry.\nAlthough the electromagnetic and weak interactions (forces) appear very different at low energies, SM unifies the\nelectromagnetism and weak interaction into a single electroweak force above the unification energy (\u223c 100 GeV).\nThe quantum chromodynamics (QCD) of SM describes the strong force (color force) between the fractionally charged\nquarks interacting by means of eight gluons (mass-less gauge bosons) associated with the color charges of quarks.\nThe color force is about one hundred times stronger than electromagnetic force, which in turn is orders of magnitude\nstronger than the weak interaction and gravitation. The strong force is assumed to be mediated by gluons, acting\nupon quarks, antiquarks, and the gluons themselves. On the short distance, the strong force holds quarks and gluons\ntogether to form the proton, neutron and other particles. On the longer distance, the color force binds protons and\nneutrons together to form the nucleus. In such a case, the force is considered as the residuum of the strong interaction\nbetween the quarks that make up the protons and neutrons. The lines of force of the gluons interacting with each\nother at long distances collimate into strings. In this way, the mathematical formalism of QCD not only explains\nhow quarks interact over short distances, but also the string-like behavior, which they manifest over longer distances.\nFinally, the still undiscovered Higgs boson of the hypothetical Higgs quantum field, which has a non-zero expectation\nvalue in empty space, gives rest mass to the all observed elementary particles, except the photon and gluon, without\nbreaking the so-called gauge invariance of the mathematical formalism of SM.\nMathematically, the electromagnetic, weak-nuclear and strong-nuclear fields and interactions (forces) are modeled in\nthe frame of the Lagrangian or Hamiltonian formalism, which controls the dynamics of the three fundamental fields.\nEach kind of point-like particles is described in terms of the respective dynamical field which exists and evolutes\naccording to the Euler-Lagrange or Hamiltonian-Jacobi equation of motion with the initial and boundary conditions\nimposed in the 4-D spacetime. The most general renormalizable Lagrangian (Hamiltonian) of the fields is constructed\nby postulating a set of symmetries of the field-spacetime system that satisfies the experimentally observed particle\n(field) content. Naturally, the fundamental fields must obey the experimentally observed global Poincar\u00e9 symmetry\n[T ranslations \u00d7 SO+ (1, 3)], which consists of the ordinary translational symmetry, rotational symmetry and the\ninertial coordinate system invariance of Einstein's theory of special relativity. The local SU (3) \u00d7 SU (2) \u00d7 U (1)\ngauge symmetry is an internal symmetry constructed and adjusted to provide the three experimentally observed\nfundamental interactions and the number and kind of elementary particles and anti-particles. The hypercharge U (1),\nweak isospin SU (2) and colour SU (3) symmetries correspond to the electromagnetic, weak and strong interactions,\nrespectively. These gauge symmetries obey the twelve flavours of elementary fermions, plus their corresponding\nantiparticles, as well as the four elementary gauge bosons that mediate the electromagnetic, strong and weak forces.\nSM contains the nineteen free (adjustable) parameters, including coupling constants of the fundamental interactions,\nwhose numerical values are established experimentally. The observable quantities associated with a fundamental field\nof SM are not changed under the respective transformation attributed to the symmetry of the Lagrangian, even\nthough the transformed field configuration vary in spacetime. All the changes of the field configuration mediated\nby the gauge transformation do cancel each other when written in terms of the observable quantities (energies,\nmomentums, spins, charges, etc.). In other words, the different configurations of a fundamental field associated\nwith the respective gauge symmetry (gauge invariance) of the field have identical observable quantities. The global\nPoincar\u00e9 symmetry [T ranslations \u00d7 SO+ (1, 3)] conserves energy, momentum and angular momentum. The local\ngauge symmetry [SU (3) \u00d7 SU (2) \u00d7 U (1)] conserves color charge, weak isospin, electric charge and weak hypercharge.\nThe accidental symmetry (continuous U (1) global symmetry) conserves the barion, electron, muon and tau numbers.\nFrom the point of view of the symmetry formalism of SM, the mathematical nature of a gauge transformation,\nwhich is a transformation from one field configuration to another, determines the mathematical nature of the gauge\nboson. Physically, the existence of the electromagnetic, strong and weak interactions arises in SM from a type of\ngauge symmetry relating to the fact that all elementary particles of a given type are experimentally indistinguishable\nfrom each other. The quantum properties of the classical (non-quantum) fundamental fields of SM are explored\nmathematically by defining creation and annihilation quantum operators with the commutation relations imposed,\nwhich add and subtract particles. This is known as the second quantization approach. The second quantization is\nperformed by replacing the classical (non-quantum) spatially-infinite fields by the respective multimode field operators.\nTo this end, one could mention some candidate models closely connecting with with the basic physical and mathematical concepts of SM. The current best models attempting to unify all fundamental particles and interactions of SM\nand gravitation call for the symmetries, known as super-symmetries, which are different from the U (1), SU (2) and\nSU (3) gauge symmetries. For instance, the Grand Unified Theories (GUTs) are proposals to show that the three fundamental interactions, other than gravity, arise from a single interaction characterized by one larger gauge symmetry\nwith one unified coupling constant that breaks down at low energy levels to the three fundamental interactions with\nthe respective coupling constants. GUTs predict relationships among the constants of nature, such as the electromag-\n\n\f65\nnetic, week and strong interaction constants, which are unrelated in SM. Some theories beyond SM look for a graviton\nto complete SM, while others, emphasize the possibility that the spacetime itself may have quantum nature (in form\nof the so-called \"atoms of space and time\") and more than four spacetime dimensions. Theories of Everything try\nto integrate GUTs with quantum gravity theories, which include the string theory, loop quantum gravity and twistor\ntheory. Some of these theories include a hypothetical fifth fundamental force to explain the recently-discovered accelerating expansion of the universe, giving rise to a need of the possible modifications of the Einstein general relativity.\nThe fifth fundamental force has also been suggested to explain phenomena such as CP violations, cosmological \"dark\"\nmatter (energy-mass), and \"dark\" flow. In some supersymmetric theories, the new particles (moduli) acquire their\nmasses through supersymmetry breaking effects mediating even more fundamental forces, which are different from\nthe forces of SM and Einstein's gravitation. For the detailed description of the physical concepts and mathematical\nformulations of SM and candidate models see the canonical studies and traditional textbooks, as well as any paper,\nreview paper or textbook published in the literature on the quantum fields and interactions (for instance, see Refs.\n[1\u201338] and references therein).\n2.2. Critical analysis of basic concepts of Standard Model of Particle Physics\n\nThe classical (non-quantum) and quantum fields of SM are modelled by using simultaneously the energy conservation\nlaw and the Dirac interpretation of quantum interference associated with the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum\nmechanics. According to Paul Dirac, under the quantum interference each particle interferes only with itself. In other\nwords, the fundamental (global) spatially-infinite fields of the particles in SM do satisfy both the energy conservation\nlaw and the interference-less properties of particles. Part I of the present study pointed out that the phenomenon\nof redistribution of the field energy (intensity) by the interaction of quantum fields of SM is quit similar to the\nredistribution of the field energy (intensity) under the ordinary interference of classical fields. Therefore, the interaction\nof fields can be considered, at least formally, as the interference of fields. Under the Dirac quantum interference,\nhowever, the interference (cross-correlation) between two different particles never occurs. Thus the interaction of\nparticles in SM is not attributed to the interference and the respective cross-correlation energy of classical (nonquantum) or quantum fields. This conceptual aspect of SM did not attract any critical attention of researchers due\nto the huge progress of the quantum physics, quantum field theory and SM based on the standard interpretation of\nquantum mechanics. It is clear now that the postulate of \"interference-less\", self interfering particles has played a\nkey role in the method and direction of development of the all modern theories of fields, particles and interactions.\nThe Copenhagen-Dirac postulate is the common background of the canonical quantum mechanics, traditional quantum\nfield theories and SM, which do provide adequate description almost of the all-known physical phenomena.\nLet me describe in more details how the postulate of interference-less particles relates to quantum mechanics and\nSM. In agreement with the Dirac postulate based on the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics, the particles of quantum mechanics and SM have been modeled to be free from the interference (cross-correlation) with other\nparticles. Therefore it was extremely difficult for physicists to find a mathematical method of the \"legal\" insertion\nof the interference between particles and the respective cross-correlation energy into canonical quantum physics and\nSM. The mathematical cross-correlation (\"hidden\" interference) between particles and the respective cross-correlation\nenergy have been automatically inserted into the quantum mechanics and SM by using the different powerful mathematical approximations, which do not compare well with the Copenhagen-Dirac postulate (see, Part I). The \"hidden\"\ninterference contradicts, in an extremely non-trivial manner, the basic principles of canonical quantum mechanics\nand quantum field theory based on the Copenhagen (\"probabilistic\") interpretation of quantum mechanics and the\nDirac postulate of interference-less particles. The \"hidden\" interference has been originally used in the construction (\"mathematical engineering\") of models for successful explanations of the coherent quantum phenomena, such\nas the Bose-Einstein condensation, superfluidity, superconductivity, supermagnetism, super-radiation, and quantum\nanomalous and fractional Hall effects. The \"hidden\" insertion of the interference between particles into the models\nyielded the correct description of the particle interference (interaction), cross-correlation (interaction) energy, particle\nnumber, Bose-Einstein statistics, Fermi-Dirac correlations (statistics) and Pauli exclusion principle. Then the mathematical approach in the form of \"mathematical engineering\" that does not require any critical analysis of the physical\nconcepts has been successfully extended also to quantum field theories and SM. The \"mathematical engineering\"\nbased on the \"hidden\" interference mediated by the pure mathematical reasons (approximations), which contradict\nthe Copenhagen-Dirac postulate, was generally accepted by the physics community in the very past. It is effectively\nused in quantum mechanics, quantum field theories and SM up to now without any critical analysis.\nAlthough the \"hidden\" interference between particles and the respective cross-correlation energy are closely connected with the pure mathematical approximations, SM relies on a set of approximations specific to the particular\n\n\f66\nphysical problem. The \"hidden\" mathematical interference between particles and the respective cross-correlation\nenergy have appeared in quantum mechanics, quantum field theories and SM already at the very beginning of consideration of the physical problems pertaining to the properties of quantum systems made of a large number of particles\n(many-body problem). The \"hidden\" interference (cross-correlation) between particles did appear in these theories\nin the form of the interaction (cross-correlation) energy describing by the interaction integrals in the mathematically\nconstructed trial Hamiltonians. In SM the \"hidden\" interference (interaction) of the non-quantum (classical) fields is\nassociated with the interaction energy of the fields describing by the trial non-quantum field Hamiltonian. Then the\nquantum properties of classical fundamental fields of SM are explored mathematically by defining creation (\u00e2\u2020 ) and\nannihilation (\u00e2) quantum operators with the commutation relations imposed, which add and subtract particles. That\nis known as the second quantization approach. Mathematically, the second quantization is performed by inserting\nthe spatially-infinite classical fields \u03a8 and \u03a8\u2217 into an infinite resonator and subsequent replacement of these fields\nby the respective multimode field operators \u03a8\u0302 and \u03a8\u0302\u2020 . The \"hidden\" inter-particle interference and the respective\ninteraction energy are provided in SM by the trial cross-correlating operators (pure mathematical objects) with the\ntrial (Bogoliubov-like) commutator relations for the particles and antiparticles, namely the experimentally observable\nbosons and fermions and the virtual (unobservable) gauge bosons associated with the gauge fields, the gauge symmetry and the gauge symmetry breaking (spontaneous or not). In other words, the \"hidden\" interference between\nparticles and the respective cross-correlation energy associated with the quantum fields are mediated automatically by\nthe cross-correlation between the operators in the interaction integrals of the trial Hamiltonian field-operator of SM.\nThe trial, artificially-constructed field Hamiltonians and the respective Hamiltonian operators of SM are invariant\nunder the U (1) local gauge transformation given rise to the very particular mathematical cross-correlation (\"hidden\"\ninterference) and the respective energy, which do not depend on the particle phases. In such a case, the all-known\ncoherent quantum phenomena are provided in the modified quantum mechanics and SM not only by the coherent particles (wave-functions), but also by the incoherent particles that have absolutely different phases. That means that the\ncross-correlation (\"hidden\" interference) is provided rather by the pure mathematical approximations than the largescale classical or quantum coherence. The physical mechanism behind the \"hidden\" interference and cross-correlation\nenergy of particles is mediated by the different mathematical approximations, which do not compare well with the\nCopenhagen-Dirac postulate of \"interference-less\", self interfering particles. In the frame of such an approach, the\ncoherent quantum phenomena may be attributed even to the mathematical errors mediated by the mathematical\napproximations. Although SM is usually considered to be the unique and correct outcome of combining the rules of\nquantum mechanics with special relativity, it seems that SM contradicts at least formally to the basic (CopenhagenDirac) physical principle [a particle interferes (correlates) only with itself] of the canonical quantum mechanics and\nparticle field theory. That is to say that the all-known physical interpretations of SM are based on interpretations\nof the pure mathematical approximations, which do contradict the basic postulate of the modern quantum physics,\nnamely the Copenhagen-Dirac postulate of interference-less particles associated with the Copenhagen interpretation\nof quantum mechanics.\nIt could be also mentioned that the Copenhagen interpretation (philosophy) of the de Broglie wave using the pure\nmathematical object (probability) did not solve really the problem of physical interpretation of quantum mechanics.\nIn any physical interpretation, the probability or the wave of probability would be rather a pure mathematical (nonmaterial) object than a real material substance. Unfortunately, up to now, both the Schr\u00f6dinger interpretation\nof the de Broglie wave using arguments of classical theories of real material waves and the Einstein determinism\nof classical physics over the Copenhagen probabilistic quantum physics are rejected in principle by the scientific\ncommunity. It could be also noted that the Klein-Gordon-Fock and Dirac relativistic equations in the modern generallyaccepted interpretation describe the global infinite fields of particles, while they have been originally formulated and\ninterpreted by the authors as single-particle equations analogous to the Schr\u00f6dinger equation. In SM, up to now, it\nis not completely clear how to interpret physically the field (wave) of operators. In any interpretation, an operator\nshould be considered rather as a pure mathematical object than a real physical matter. For more details of the\nabove-mentioned methodological and philosophical problems, see Part I.\n2.3. Basic concepts of the present model of the unified fields, particles and interactions\n\nThe basic physical concepts (principles) of the present model, which do associate with the unified fields, particles\nand interactions, are different from the Standard Model of Particle Physics. However, the present model does not\nuse the extra dimensions of spacetime, the fifth (\"dark\") fundamental energy-mass and force or other hypothetical\nobjects of the modern candidate models, such as the Grand Unified Theories and Theories of Everything. Part II of\nthe present study deals with the Einstein special relativity and quantum mechanics unified by using the concepts that\n\n\f67\nhave been introduced and developed in Part I. Let me now summarize and briefly interpret these concepts emphasizing\ntheir methodological and philosophical aspects in the context of the above-described conceptual picture of SM.\nThe most basic concept of the present model is extremely simple and transparent. The concept is based on the\nwell-known law of physics, namely the interference phenomenon. In contrast to the non-material waves associated\nwith the wave functions of canonical quantum mechanics and the non-material operator fields of SM, which deal\nwith the interference-less (each particle interferes only with itself) wave functions and spatially-infinite fundamental\nfields of the operators, the present model suggests existence of an arbitrary number of the interfering, spatially-finite\nfundamental fields (beams) of the real physical matter (mass-energy). The spatially-finite material fields \u03c8n (r, t) of the\nfundamental kind may interfere (cross-correlate) with each other and/or with the finite fields of another fundamental\nkind. The fundamental spatially-finite fields \u03c8n (r, t) are composed from the respective indivisible unit-fields \u03c80n (r, t)\nPN\nof the mass-energy, \u03c8n (r, t) = n=1 \u03c80n (r, t). The unit-field (unit-wave) \u03c80n (r, t) could interfere with itself as well\nwith the other (n 6= m) unit-fields \u03c80m (r, t). The real, material, spatially-finite unit-field (unit-wave) \u03c80n (r, t),\nwhich does associate with the respective elementary particle and its physical matter (mass-energy), is not the wave\nof probability of quantum mechanics or the field (wave) of operators of SM. In other words, the unit-field is not\nexplained as a point particle or a wave of quantum mechanics (particle-wave dualism) or a point particle of SM.\nThe unit-field has simultaneously properties of the point particle and wave of quantum mechanics, the point particle\nof SM and the 3-D (in space) wave of theory of classical fields. An indivisible unit-field may exist in the infinite\nnumber of configurations. The exact form and dynamics of the indivisible unit-field \u03c80n (r, t), which depends on the\nexperimental conditions, is determined by the field Lagrangian (Hamiltonian) and the Euler-Lagrange (HamiltonianJacobi) equation of motion with the initial and boundary conditions imposed. In SM, up to now, it is not completely\nclear how to interpret physically the field (wave) of operators. An operator is rather a pure mathematical object\nthan a real physical substance. In the present model, the division of the \"non-quantum\" field \u03c8n of the real physical\nmatter (mass-energy) into the indivisible \"non-quantum\" unit-fields \u03c80n of the mass-energy, in fact, is the second\nquantization of the field without the use of the non-material fields (waves) of operators or probabilities.\nThe interference between unit-fields (particles) could affect many basic physical properties of the particles. Under\nthe quantum interference each particle of the canonical quantum mechanics can interfere only with itself. In the\npresent model, unlike in the Dirac model of quantum interference, the particles (unit-fields) may interfere (interact)\nalso with each other. Thus the attractive or repulsive forces associated with interaction of the particles are attributed\nto the interference (cross-correlation) of the interfering (interacting) unit-fields. That is to say that the positive or\nnegative gradient of the field cross-correlation energy does induce the attractive or repulsive forces that redistribute\nthe field energy (intensity). In the frame of such an approach, the quantum and classical descriptions are in agreement\nfor an arbitrary number of particles (unit-fields). It should be stressed that the physical system of the interfering\n(interacting) fields includes not only the interfering fields, but also the environment (material boundaries or other\nfields) that could provide the pure constructive or destructive interference. In other words, the unit-fields (particles)\ndo interfere and interact not only with each other, but also with the environment. Although the field energy is\nchanged under the pure constructive or destructive interference of fields, the total energy of the physical system is\nconserved. The pure additive or subtractive interference is provided by the \"additional\" energy, which should be\nadded or subtracted from the total physical system before the interference of fields (particles) with each other. In\nsuch a case, the physical system of the interfering (interacting) fields does not obey the shift symmetry of time.\nThe energy conservation of the total physical system is provided rather by the exchange of the field energy with the\nenvironment than by the shift symmetry of time and the Dirac quantum interference associated with \"interference-less\"\nself-interfering particles. The interaction (cross-correlation) energy is attributed in the present model to the gradient\nof cross-correlation energy mediating by the interference between the unit-fields (particles) of the physical matter\n(mass-energy). Consequently, the physical mechanism behind the number of particles, cross-correlation (interference),\ncross-correlation energy, interference (interaction), Bose-Einstein statistics, Fermi-Dirac statistics and Pauli exclusion\nprinciple is associated with the repulsive and attractive forces mediating by the additive and subtractive interference\n(cross-correlation) of the unit-waves (bosons or fermions) of the physical matter (mass-energy). This mechanism plays\na key role in the basic coherent quantum phenomena, such as Bose-Einstein condensation, super-radiation, Bosenova\neffect, superfluidity, superconductivity, supermagnetism, and quantum anomalous and fractional Hall effects. For\nmore details and explanations, see Part I.\nIn the standard model of fields, particles and interactions, the mathematical cross-correlation (\"hidden\" interference)\nis associated with the pure mathematical approximations, which do not compare well with the basic physical principle (the Copenhagen-Dirac postulate of \"interference-less\" self-interfering particles) of canonical quantum physics.\nPhysically, the \"hidden\" interference is interpreted as the inter-particle interaction and the interaction energy. In the\npresent model of the unified fields, particles and interactions, which could be considered as a generalization of SM, the\nunification is performed by taking into account rather the interference-induced energy mediated by the real, direct,\n\n\f68\nphysical interference between material unit-fields than the \"hidden\", mathematical interference between non-material\nwaves of probabilities or operators associated with the point-like particles and the respective cross-correlation (interaction) energy. The \"non-hidden\" interference between material unit-fields may be considered as the EPR hypothetical\n\"hidden\" variable, which according to Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen should be added to quantum mechanics to avoid\nits indeterminism and superluminal signalling (see, also discussions related to the EPR paradox associated with superluminal signalling in Part I). In Part I, the Hamiltonians that describe the cross-correlation energy mediating by\ninterference of the basic classical and quantum material fields composed from the 3-dimensional (in space) unit-fields\nof physical matter have been derived by the generalization of the traditional Hamiltonians of the classical and quantum\nfield theories for the superposition of the interfering unit-fields (interacting particles). Part II uses this background for\nunification of the electromagnetic, weak, strong and gravitational fields, particles and interactions. However, unlike\nin Part I, the unification is performed rather by the generalization of the basic (mass-energy) relation of the Einstein\nrelativity than the traditional Hamiltonians of quantum field theory. The model unifies the all-known fields, particles\nand interactions by the straightforward generalization of the Einstein relativistic energy-mass relation \u03b52 = k2 + m2\nfor the interfering (interacting) particles and bodies composed from the interfering unit-fields. The unit-fields exhibit\nsimultaneously properties of the point particles and waves of quantum mechanics (particle-wave duality), the point\nparticles of SM, the strings of theories of strings and the 3-D (in space) waves of theories of classical fields. Therefore\nthe unification of the electromagnetic, weak, strong and gravitational fields and interactions could be considered not\nonly as the generalization of SM, but also as the further development and unification of the quantum mechanics,\nclassical and quantum field theories, SM and string theories. In order to make the unification understandable to the\nnon-specialists in classical and quantum fields, the following analysis is performed in many philosophical, physical and\nmathematical details.\n3. UNIFICATION OF A SINGLE ELEMENTARY PARTICLE AND A SINGLE UNIT-FIELD: A SINGLE\nPARTICLE (N = 1)\n\nPN\nAccording to the basic physical concept of the present model, the fundamental fields \u03c8n (r, t) = n=1 \u03c80n (r, t)\nare composed from the interfering, indivisible unit-fields \u03c80n (r, t) of the mass-energy associated with the elementary\nparticles. The unification of the fundamental (electromagnetic, weak, strong and gravitational) fields, particles and\ninteractions in the model is based on the generalization of the famous energy-mass relation \u03b52 = k2 + m2 of the\nEinstein special relativity for the case of the interacting particles and bodies composed from the interfering (crosscorrelating) unit-fields. Section 3 begins the unification with the generalization of the Einstein energy-mass relation\nfor the unit-field \u03c80 associated with a single (N=1) elementary particle, which is free from interactions with other\nparticles. The generalized mass-energy relation then yields the equation of motion for the unit-field. The exact form\n(configuration) and dynamics of the single unit-field (elementary particle) is determined by the equation of motion\nwith the initial and boundary conditions imposed. The generalization, in fact, is simply the unification of the Einstein\nrelativity of a point-like particle and the quantum mechanics of a wave-like (de Broglie) particle. Mathematically, the\ngeneralization of the Einstein energy-mass relation is performed by using the second or first derivatives of a unit-field,\nsince these two approaches are equivalent in the case of the de Broglie wave (unit-field) associated with a free particle.\nFor the sake of generality, the model is presented also in the alternative form by using the unit-field Lagrangian that\ncorresponds to the generalized energy-mass relation for the unit-field \u03c80 . In such a case, the model is formulated in\nthe frame of the Lagrangian formalism, where the configuration and dynamics of the single unit-field is determined by\nthe field Lagrangian and the Euler-Lagrange equation of motion with the initial and boundary conditions imposed.\n3.1. The energy-mass relation and equation of motion for a free unit-field associated with a free particle\n3.1.1. The model based on the 2nd derivatives of a free unit-field\n\n1. The model 1st-version based on the straightforward generalization of the Einstein energy-mass relation for a free\nunit-field by using the 2nd derivatives\nThe basic relation of Einstein's relativity for a single, point-like particle, which is free from interactions with other\nparticles, is given by\n\u03b520 = k20 + m20 ,\n\n(183)\n\n\f69\nwhere \u03b50 , k0 and m0 are respectively the energy, momentum and rest mass of the particle. The straightforward\ngeneralization of the Einstein relativistic energy-mass relation (183), which is associated with a free point-particle\nlocated in the spacetime point (r, t), to the case of the free spatially-extended unit-field \u03c80 (r, t) occupying the finite\nor infinite volume V is based on the use of the canonical approach of quantum mechanics. The replacement of the\nclassical energy, momentum and mass of the point particle in Eq. (183) by the respective quantum mechanical values\n\u2202\n), momentum (k\u0302 = \u2207) and mass (m\u0302 = m) of the unit-field is performed\nassociated with the operators of energy (\u03b5\u0302 = \u2202t\nby using the well-known, particular unit-field configuration \u03c80 (r, t), namely the de Broglie wave\n\u03c80 (r, t) = V \u22121/2 ei(k0 r\u2212\u03b50 t\u2212\u03b10 )\n\n(184)\n\nassociated with the free particle.

Notice, Rthe values (185) - (189) do not depend on the\nwave phase \u03b10 . Also note that the unit-field (184) is normalized by V \u03c80\u2217 \u03c80 d3 x = 1. Comparison of the right-hand\nsides of Eq. (188) and Eq. (189) yields the relativistic equation of motion\n\u0003\u03c80 + m20 \u03c80 = 0\n2\n\n(190)\n2\n\n\u2202\n2\nNotice, the generalized\nfor the free unit-field.

The equivalent relativistic energy-mass relation and equation of motion, which are based on the\nfirst derivatives of the free unit-field, are presented in Sec. (3.1.2.). Although Eqs. (185) and (190) have been derived\nby using the particular unit-field configuration [de Broglie wave (184)], the present model assumes that Eq. (190) does\ndetermine the all possible unit-field configurations associated with any relativistic or non-relativistic free elementary\nparticle that satisfies the Einstein energy-mass relation (183). Moreover, the generalized energy-mass relation (185)\nfor the unit-field configurations determining by the equation of motion (190) with the initial and boundary conditions\nimposed is valid for the all-known free elementary particles. The value of the Einstein energy-mass given by Eq.\n(183) for a free point-particle is equal to the generalized energy-mass determining by Eq. (185) for the free unit-field\n(unit-wave) associated with this particle. Notice, Eq. (190) is indistinguishable from the Klein-Gordon-Fock equation\nof the relativistic quantum field theory. The Klein-Gordon-Fock equation in the generally accepted interpretation\n(formulation) of the quantum field theory, however, describes the global infinite field of bosons and anti-bosons,\nwhile Eq. (190) is formulated as a single-particle relativistic equation similar to the Schr\u00f6dinger equation for the\nwave-function of a free non-relativistic elementary particle of any kind. Equation (190) with the initial and boundary\nconditions imposed describes both the unit-field configuration and its dynamics.\nIn the case of a non-relativistic particle (k20 << m20 ), Eqs. (183) - (190) may be simplified.

The replacement of the classical energy, momentum and mass of the point particle in Eq.

It\nshould be stressed that Eqs. (183) - (190) are valid for both the relativistic and non-relativistic particles, while the\napproximations (191) - (196) describe only the non-relativistic particle. Also note that replacement of the unit-field\n(184) by the unit-field \u03c80 (r, t) = V \u22121/2 e\u2212i(k0 r\u2212\u03b50 t) does not modify the relativistic equations (185) - (190), while the\nreplacement does change the sign of the non-relativistic energy (193) from (+) to (\u2212).\nThe equation of motion (190) describes the configuration and dynamics of the free unit-field \u03c80 associated with a\nsingle elementary particle that is free from interactions with other particles. In other words, the unit-field configuration\n\u03c80 and the energy \u03b50 of a free particle determining by Eqs. (183) - (190) do not depend on the particle spin and\ncharge. The different configurations \u03c80 of a single unit-field corresponding to the different solutions of Eq. (190) with\nthe initial and boundary conditions imposed could be attributed to the different momentums k0 of a single elementary\nparticle having the rest mass m0 . The dynamical configuration \u03c80 corresponding to a solution of Eq. (190) for a single\nunit-field with the rest mass m0 6= 0 could be considered as the configuration describing the dynamics of a massive\nparticle. The unit-field configuration \u03c80 determining by the equation\n\u0003\u03c80 = 0\ndescribes dynamics of a mass-less (m0 = 0) particle, which has the energy squared given by\nZ\n\u0011\n\u0010\n1\n2\n\u03b50 =\n\u03c80\u2217 \u2212\u03c8\u0308 \u2212 \u22072 \u03c80 d3 x.\n2 V\n\n(197)\n\n(198)\n\nNotice, Eqs. (183) - (190) are valid for both the massive and mass-less particles, while the non-relativistic approximations (191) - (196) do not have any physical sense in the case of m0 = 0.\n2. The model 2nd-version based on the generalization of the Einstein energy-mass relation for a free unit-field by\nusing the Euler-Lagrange formalism and the 2nd derivatives\nMathematically, the standard model of particle physics is formulated in the frame of the Lagrangian or Hamiltonian\nformalism. Each kind of point-like particles is described in terms of the respective dynamical field which exists and\nevolutes according to the Euler-Lagrange or Hamiltonian-Jacobi equation of motion with the initial and boundary\nconditions imposed. The Lagrangian (Hamiltonian) of the field is constructed by postulating a set of symmetries of\nthe field-spacetime system. For instance, the fundamental fields must obey the inertial coordinate system invariance\n\n\f71\nof the Einstein theory of special relativity. The above-presented model is based on the straightforward generalization\nof the relativistic energy-mass relation of the Einstein theory. The model can be reformulated by using the Lagrangian\nformalism, where the configuration of a free unit-field (elementary particle) and its dynamics are determined by the\nunit-field Lagrangian and the Euler-Lagrange equation of motion with the initial and boundary conditions imposed.\nOne can easily demonstrate that the unit-field Lagrangian corresponding to the generalized relativistic energy-mass\nrelation (185) is given by\nZ\n\u0011\n\u0010\n1\n(199)\n\u03c80\u2217 \u03c8\u03080 \u2212 \u22072 \u03c80 + m20 \u03c80 d3 x,\nL=\n2 V\nwhere the unit-field is normalized by\nZ\n\nV\n\n\u03c80\u2217 \u03c80 d3 x = 1.\n\n(200)\n\nEquation (199) can be written as\nL=\n\nZ\n\nV\n\nLd3 x,\n\n(201)\n\nwhere\nL=\n\n1 \u2217\n\u03c8 (\u03c8\u03080 \u2212 \u22072 \u03c80 + m20 \u03c80 )\n2 0\n\n(202)\n\ndenotes the Lagrangian density, which may be presented as\nL=\n\n1 \u2217\n\u03c8 (\u2202\u03bc \u2202 \u03bc \u03c80 + m20 \u03c80 )\n2 0\n\n(203)\n\n2\n\n\u2202\n2\nIt could be noted that the unit-field \u03c80 associated with the\nusing the conventional notations \u2202\u03bc \u2202 \u03bc \u2261 \u2202t\n2 \u2212 \u2207 .\nparticle may be considered also in the frame of the Hamiltonian-Jacobi formalism. In such a case, the Hamiltonian\ncorresponding to the Lagrangian (199) has the form\nZ\nHd3 x,\n(204)\nH=\nV\n\nwhere\nH=\n\n1 \u2217\n\u03c8 (\u2212\u03c8\u03080 \u2212 \u22072 \u03c80 + m20 \u03c80 ).\n2 0\n\n(205)\n\nis the Hamiltonian density. In contrast to Part I, whose theoretical background uses the energy definition\n\u03b5=H\nof the canonical quantum field theory, the square of energy (185) is now given by another definition:\nZ\n\u0011\n\u0010\n1\n2\n\u03c80\u2217 \u2212\u03c8\u03080 \u2212 \u22072 \u03c80 + m20 \u03c80 d3 x.\n\u03b50 = H =\n2 V\n\n(206)\n\n(207)\n\nNotice, for the unit-field normalized by Eq. (200), the energy squared (207) is indistinguishable from the value (185).\nIn the frame of the Lagrange formalism, the configuration and dynamics of the unit-field \u03c80 is determined by the\nEuler-Lagrange equation\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u03b4L\n\u03b4L\n=0\n(208)\n\u2212 \u2202\u03bc\n\u03b4\u03c8 \u2217\n\u03b4\u2202\u03bc \u03c8 \u2217\nwith the initial and boundary conditions imposed. Notice, the volume V of the unit-field determining by the unit-field\nboundaries, in contrast to the infinite fields of SM, may be finite or infinite. For the Lagrangian density (203), Eq.\n(208) yields the Euler-Lagrange relativistic equation\n\u0003\u03c80 + m20 \u03c80 = 0,\n\n(209)\n\n\f72\nwhich is indistinguishable from Eq. (190).\nIn the case of a non-relativistic unit-field, the Lagrangian that corresponds to Eq. (192) is given by\n\u0013\n\u0012\nZ\n1\n1\n2\n\u2217\nL=\n\u2207 \u03c80 + m0 \u03c80 d3 x,\n\u03c8 \u2212i\u03c8\u03070 \u2212\n2 V 0\n2m0\n\n(210)\n\nwhere\nL=\n\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1 \u2217\n1\n\u22072 \u03c80 + m0 \u03c80\n\u03c80 \u2212i\u03c8\u03070 \u2212\n2\n2m0\n\n(211)\n\ndenotes the Lagrangian density. The unit-field Hamiltonian H corresponding to the Lagrangian (208) has the form\n(204), where the Hamiltonian density is given by\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\n1\nH = \u03c80\u2217 i\u03c8\u03070 \u2212\n(212)\n\u22072 \u03c80 + m0 \u03c80 .\n2\n2m0\nCorrespondingly, the non-relativistic energy \u03b5 of the unit-field is determined by the expression\n\u0013\n\u0012\nZ\n1\n1\n2\n\u2217\n\u03b50 = H =\n\u2207 \u03c80 + m0 \u03c80 d3 x,\n\u03c8 i\u03c8\u03070 \u2212\n2 V 0\n2m0\n\n(213)\n\nwhich is indistinguishable from the energy (192) for the unit-field normalized by Eq. (201). For the Lagrangian\ndensity (211), the Euler-Lagrange equation (208) yields the equation\n1\n\u22072 \u03c80 + m0 \u03c80 ,\n2m0\n\ni\u03c8\u03070 = \u2212\n\n(214)\n\nwhich is indistinguishable from Eq. (195). Notice, Eq. (199) - Eq. (214) do use the normalization (200). The normalization gives rise to the probabilistic (canonical) interpretation of the unit-field \u03c80 in Eq. (214), where the unit-field\n\u03c80 (r, t) can be reinterpreted according to the Copenhagen philosophy of quantum mechanics of point particles. The\nCopenhagen interpretation of the value \u03c1(r, t) \u2261 \u03c8 \u2217 (r, t)\u03c8(r, t) as the probability density, however, can lead to the\nwell-known philosophical and physical problems associated, for instance, with the wave-particle duality and the negative probability density. In the case of the stationary unit-field, Eq. (214) is equivalent to the Schr\u00f6dinger stationary\nequation (196) for the Copenhagen wave of probability determining by the wave-function of a free elementary particle.\n3.1.2. The model based on the 1st derivatives of a free unit-field\n\n1. The model 3-rd version based on the straightforward generalization of the Einstein energy-mass relation for a\nfree unit-field by using the 1st derivatives\nThe unit-field model presented in Sec. (3.1.1.) is based on the use of the second derivatives of a unit-field.\nEquations (185) - (190) and (192) - (214), have been derived by using Eqs. (186), (187) and (188) for the squares of\nmass, momentum and energy of the de Broglie wave (unit-field). Here, I present the alternative, equivalent formulation\nof the model, where Eqs.

The value (218) is equal to the values\n(185) and (207) only in the very particular case, when the unit-field \u03c80 has the de Broglie configuration (184). The\nequation of motion corresponding to Eq.

The energy (220) is equal to the values (192) and (213) only when\nthe unit-field \u03c80 has the de Broglie configuration (184). The equation of motion corresponding to Eq.

It should be stressed that Eqs. (222) - (234) do use the normalization (200) that gives rise to the\nprobabilistic (canonical) interpretation of the unit-field \u03c80 in Eqs. (227) and (234) as the wave-function of a free\nelementary particle associated with the Copenhagen wave of probability. That means that the non-relativistic unitfield could be interpreted as the Schr\u00f6dinger wave-function associated with the non-relativistic wave of probability.\n3.2. Physical properties of the single particle based on the generalized energy-mass relation for the single\nunit-field\n\nPhysical properties of the above-described free unit-field (particle) are summarized and interpreted as follows.\nThe generalized Einstein energy-mass relations (185) and (218) and the respective equations of motion (190) and\n(227) have been derived by using the de Broglie wave (184), which is the particular configuration of a free unit-field\nassociated with an elementary particle. The present model assumes that the energy-mass relations (185) and (218)\nwith the respective equations of motion (190) and (227) do determine the unit-field configuration of any relativistic\nor non-relativistic free elementary particle that satisfies the Einstein energy-mass relation (183). That is to say that\nthe generalized energy-mass relations (185) and (218) for the free unit-field determining by the equations of motion\n(190) and (227) with the initial and boundary conditions imposed are valid for the all-known free elementary particles.\nThere is no difference between the values of the Einstein energy-mass determining by Eq. (183) of a free point particle\nand the generalized energy-mass given by Eqs. (185) and (218) for the free unit-field associated with this particle.\n\n\f75\nEquations (190) and (227) look like the Klein-Gordon-Fock equation of the relativistic quantum field theory. However,\nin contrast to the Klein-Gordon-Fock equation of quantum field theory describing the global infinite field of particles\n(scalar bosons), Eqs. (190) and (227) are formulated and interpreted as a single-particle relativistic equation similar\nto the Schr\u00f6dinger equation for the de Broglie wave of the matter associated with a non-relativistic particle. It could\nbe mentioned again that the Klein-Gordon-Fock equation has been originally formulated and interpreted by the authors\nas a single-particle equation analogous to the Schr\u00f6dinger equation.\nThe equations of motion (190) and (227) describe the configuration and dynamics of the free unit-field \u03c80 that\ndetermine the physical properties of a single elementary particle that is free from interactions with other particles.\nThe unit-field configuration \u03c80 and the self-energy \u03b50 of a free particle determining by Eqs. (183) - (214) or Eqs. (215)\n- (234) do not depend on the spin and charge of the particle. The kind (type) of a free particle and the respective\nunit-field configuration are determined in Eqs. (183) - (234) solely by the particle rest-mass m0 . The free particles\n(unit-fields) could be distinguished from each other by the particle rest-mass m0 . In other words, the free particles\n(unit-fields) having the different rest masses could be considered as different particles (unit-fields). For instance, the\ndynamical configuration \u03c80 corresponding to a solution of Eq. (190) or (227) for a single unit-field with the rest\nmass m0 6= 0 could be considered as the configuration describing the dynamics of a massive particle. The unit-field\nconfiguration \u03c80 determining by the equation (197) or (228) describes dynamics of the mass-less (m0 = 0) particle.\nFor the given rest-mass m0 , Eqs. (190) and (227) with the initial and boundary conditions imposed describe not only\nthe unit-field configuration and the kind of a free particle, but also its dynamics. The different configurations \u03c80 of\na single unit-field corresponding to the different solutions of Eq. (190) or (227) could be attributed to the different\nmomentums k0 of a single elementary particle having the rest mass m0 . Although the unit-field \u03c80 describing by\nEqs. (183) - (214) or Eqs. (215) - (234) is material one, it is not measurable quantity. The experimentally observable\nquantities are the rest mass m0 , momentum k0 and energy \u03b50 of the unit-field (particle). These quantities control\nthe unit-filed configuration and its dynamics and vice versa. For an example, the \"annihilation\" of the rest mass\nm0 6= 0 in the energy-mass relations (185) and (218) and the respective equations of motion (190) and (227), yields\nthe change of the unit-field configuration and the kind of a particle. The annihilation yields the new (mass-less) unitfield configuration corresponding to the new (mass-less) particle, which is determined by the energy-mass relation\n(198) or (229) and the respective equation of motion (197) or (228). According to the energy conservation law the\nunit-field energy can be converted from one form to another, but it cannot be created or destroyed. Therefore the\nenergy of the new (mass-less) unit-field determining by Eq. (198) or (229) must be equal respectively to the energy of\nthe annihilated massive unit-field given by Eq. (185) or (218). It should be mentioned that the relativistic equations\n(183) - (190), (197) - (209), (215) - (219) and (222) - (229) are valid for both the massive and mass-less particles,\nwhile the non-relativistic approximations (191) - (196), (210) - (214), (220) , (221), (230) -(234) do not have any\nphysical sense in the case of m0 = 0. In other words, the non-relativistic equations could not describe the creation of\na mass-less (m0 = 0) particle under the annihilation of a massive (m0 6= 0) particle (unit-field).\nFrom a point of view of the energy, a point particle and the unit-wave associated with this particle are equivalent\n(indistinguishable) objects. Indeed, the relativistic particle satisfies simultaneously the relativistic energy-mass relation (183) for a point particle of Einstein's special relativity and the generalized (equivalent) relativistic energy-mass\nrelation (185) or (218) for the unit-wave associated with this particle. In addition, the non-relativistic energy (191)\nof a point particle of the Einstein non-relativistic theory (Newton mechanics) is equal to the non-relativistic energy\n(192) or (233) of the non-relativistic unit-wave. The equality of energies of the point particle and the unit-wave could\nbe considered as the particle-wave duality similar to the particle-wave duality in the Schr\u00f6dinger (non-relativistic)\nquantum mechanics of the de Broglie wave associated with a free particle. The formulation of the present model in the\nframe of the Lagrangian-Hamiltonian formalism with the normalization (200) gives rise to the probabilistic (quantum\nmechanical) interpretation of the unit-field (wave) \u03c80 . However, in contrast to the quantum-mechanical wave-function\n\u03c80 (r, t) of a point particle located in the spatiotemporal point (r, t) with the probability density \u03c80\u2217 (r, t)\u03c80 (r, t), the\nmaterial unit-field \u03c80 (r, t) associated with the particle mass-energy does really exist in the each spatiotemporal point\n(r, t) of the unit-field. That is the fundamental (principal) difference between the canonical quantum mechanics and\nthe present model. It could be also mentioned that the two versions of the unit-field model, which are based on the 1st\nor 2nd derivatives of the unit-field, have the different forms (185) and (218) of the generalized Einstein energy-mass\nrelation, but the indistinguishable equations of motion (190) and (227). The energy-mass relations (185) and (218)\nare equivalent for the de Broglie wave (184) associated with a single particle that is free from interactions with other\nparticles. In other words, for the unit-field configuration (184), one can use the 1st or 2nd derivatives of the unit-field\nin Eqs. (185), (218), (190) and (227). Although these two versions of the model are equivalent for the de Broglie\nwave (184), Sec. (4) shows that they may give different results for more complicated unit-field configurations.\n\n\f76\n3.3. The role of initial and boundary conditions in dynamics of a single unit-field\n\nThe kind of a free elementary particle in Eqs. (183) - (234) of the above-presented conceptual model of a free unitfield (particle) is determined by the particle rest-mass m0 , only. The rest mass m0 could be considered as a particular\nkind of the initial conditions. For a given rest-mass m0 , the equation of motion (190) or (227) with the initial and\nboundary conditions imposed describes dynamics of the unit-field configuration. The dynamical configurations \u03c80\ncorresponding to the different solutions of the equation of motion could be attributed to the different momentums k0\nof the same particle. That is to say that the unit-field associated with an elementary particle having the rest mass\nm0 does exist in different configurations corresponding to the different solutions of the equation of motion with the\nactual initial and boundary conditions. A solution to the differential equation of motion is unambiguously determined\nif the value of the unit-field function (Dirichlet boundary conditions) or the normal derivative (Neumann boundary\nconditions) of the unit-field function is specified on the boundaries. In the present study, a unit-field is considered as\nthe free unit-field if it does interact only with the boundaries imposed by the empty, \"straight\" spacetime (true vacuum).\nFor instance, a massive, free unit-field describing by Eqs. (190) or (227) has a boundary between the massive unit-field\nand the mass-less true vacuum. That means that the massive, free unit-field does interact only with the mass-less\nboundary of the true vacuum (empty, \"straight\" spacetime). A mass-less, free unit-field, which is described by Eqs.\n(197) or (228), has a boundary between the mass-less (m0 = 0) unit-field and the mass-less true vacuum. In such\na case, a mass-less, free unit-field interacts with the mass-less boundary of the empty, \"straight\" spacetime. A free\nunit-field before interaction with the material boundaries is considered as a free unit-field. The material boundaries\ncan be modified by using the external energy, namely the energy that does not associate with the unit-field energy.\nInteraction of a unit-field with the actual material boundaries may change or not change the absolute value |k0 | of\nthe unit-field momentum k0 . The interaction that changes the value |k0 | is called a non-elastic process. The process\ncould be interpreted as the exchange of energy between the unit-field and the boundary. Analysis of such a process\nrequires the detailed model of interaction of the unit-field (particle) with the unit-fields (particles) of the material\nboundary. If the interaction does not affect the momentum absolute value |k0 |, then the interaction has an elastic\ncharacter. The elastic interaction of a single unit-field with the material boundaries can be treated phenomenologically\nby using the Dirichlet or Neumann boundary conditions for the equation of motion (190) or (227). The evolution\nof the unit-field configuration under the free-space propagation and elastic interaction of the single unit-field with a\nmaterial boundary is illustrated by the following three examples.\nLet me first consider the simplest, relativistic unit-field configuration that corresponds to the free plane-wave,\nnamely the time-harmonic solutions of the relativistic equations (190), (209), (221) and (227) for the empty, \"straight\"\nspacetime. At the initial time moment t = 0, such a unit-field is given by the de Broglie wave\n\u03c80 (r, t) = a0 ei(k0 r\u2212\u03c90 t\u2212\u03b10 )\n\n(235)\n\nwith the unit-wave amplitude a0 = V \u22121/2 and the phase \u03b10 = 0, where V 6= \u221e is the volume occupying by the\nspatially finite unit-field \u03c80 (r, t) = a0 eik0 r . Notice, the unit-wave amplitude a0 decreases with increasing the volume\nV . It could be also mentioned that the aforementioned amplitude a0 = V \u22121/2 of the unit-wave (235) is different\nfrom the value a0 = (2V0 \u03b50 )\u22121/2 of the unit-wave (16) in Part I of the present study as well as from the amplitude\nak = (2V0 \u03b5k )\u22121/2 of the scalar bosons and anti-bosons in the global quantum fields (3) and (4) of Part I. In Eq.\n(235), \u03c90 = \u03b50 and k0 denote respectively the unit-wave frequency and wave-number. The unit-field (particle) has\nthe momentum k0 given by\nZ\n\u03c80\u2217 (\u2212i\u2207\u03c80 ) d3 x.\n(236)\nk0 =\nV\n\nThe unit-field frequency (energy) satisfies the Einstein energy-mass relation (183), which has the form of the relativistic\ndispersion relation \u03c90 2 = k02 + m20 . The unit-field propagates in the free-space along the direction k0 /k0 with the\nso-called group velocity vg = |vg | = d\u03c90 /dk0 . The use of the Einstein dispersion relation yields the group velocity\nvg = 1/(1 + m20 /k20 )1/2 .\n\n(237)\n\nEach point of the unit-field propagates within the unit-field with the phase velocity v = (\u03c90 /k0 )(k0 /k0 ). The value\nv = |v| = \u03c90 /k0 is given by\nv = (1 + m20 /k20 )1/2 .\n\n(238)\n\nThe group velocity satisfies the inequality vg \u2264 c for any value of m0 or k0 (in the natural units, vg = (1+m20 /k20 )1/2 \u2264\n1). That means that a signal associated with the massive unit-field (particle) propagates through the true vacuum\n\n\f77\nwith the speed vg \u2264 c. A massive particle is considered to be at the rest (vg = 0) if the particle momentum\nk0 = 0. Each point of the massive unit-field propagates within the unit-field with the phase velocity (238), where\nv \u2192 0 if the unit-field is associated with the relativistic particle (k0 \u2192 \u221e). In the case of the mass-less (m0 = 0)\nunit-field, which is described by Eqs. (190), (209), (221) and (227) with m0 = 0 or simply by Eqs. (197) and\n(228), the dispersion relation is given by \u03c90 2 = k02 . The respective group velocity vg is equal to the speed of light\n(vg = c = 1). The phase velocity v of the mass-less unit-field also is equal to the speed of light (v = c = 1). Thus a\nsignal associated with the mass-less unit-field (particle) propagates through both the true vacuum and the unit-field\nmedium with the luminal velocity (vg = v = c = 1). In the non-relativistic case (k20 << m20 ), the group velocity (237)\nof the unit-field (235) is equal to the non-relativistic (Newton) velocity vg = k0 /m0 of the non-relativistic particle\nassociated with the unit-field. Notice, the similar dynamics of the the non-relativistic unit-field (235) is predicted\nby the non-relativistic equations (195), (196), (214), (221) and (234) with the respective non-relativistic dispersion\nrelation \u03c90 = (k02 + m20 )1/2 \u2248 (k02 /2m0 ) + m0 . In such a case, the group and phase velocities are given by vg \u2248 k0 /m0\nand v \u2248 m0 /k0 , respectively. The phase velocity of the non-relativistic unit-field determining by Eq. (238) is also\ngiven by the value v \u2248 m0 /k0 . A signal associated with the phase velocity propagates through the unit-field having\nthe momentum k0 \u2192 0 with the infinite speed (v \u2192 \u221e). The unit-field configuration (235) and momentum (236) do\nnot change under propagation of the unit-field in the true vacuum. Indeed, at any time moment t = t\u2032 , the unit-field\nhas the configuration\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u03c80 (r\u2032 , t\u2032 ) = a0 ei(k0 r \u2212\u03c90 t )\n\n(239)\n\nwith the unit-field momentum k0 and frequency \u03c90 . Here, a0 = V \u22121/2 is the unit-field amplitude, and V is the volume\noccupying by the unit-field at the moment t = t\u2032 .\n\u2032\u2032\n\u2032\u2032\nLet me now suppose that at the time moment t = t\u2032\u2032 the unit-field \u03c80 (r\u2032\u2032 , t\u2032\u2032 ) = a0 ei(k0 r \u2212\u03c90 t ) begins propagation\nthrough the \"transparent\" aperture in the \"non-transparent\" infinitely thin material screen placed in the true vacuum.\nUnder the propagation, the unit-field interacts with the material boundaries of the screen. The evolution of the unitfield configuration behind the screen at the time t > t\u2032\u2032 can be described using the well-known Fresnel-Kirchhoff\nintegral theorem as\n\u0012 i(k0 R\u2212\u03c90 t) \u0013\n\u0015\nZ Z \u0014\n1\n\u2202\nei(k0 R\u2212\u03c90 t) \u2202\u03c80\ne\n\u03c80 (P, t) =\n\u03c80\n\u2212\ndS,\n(240)\n4\u03c0\n\u2202n\nR\nR\n\u2202n\nS\nwhere R is the distance from the point P to the point (x\u2032\u2032 , y \u2032\u2032 , z \u2032\u2032 ) of the unit-field \u03c80 \u2261 \u03c80 (r\u2032\u2032 , t\u2032\u2032 ) on the surface\nS of the aperture, and \u2202/\u2202n denotes differentiation along the normal to the surface of integration. The FresnelKirchhoff integral theorem (240) for the mass-less (m0 = 0) wave is usually regarded as an integral form of the\nwave equation \u0003\u03c80 = 0 with the dispersion relation \u03c90 2 = k20 and the conventional boundary conditions imposed\nby the \"non-transparent\" boundaries. The diffraction integral (240) for an optical wave is considered as one of the\npossible mathematical formulations of the Huygens-Fresnel diffraction principle in optics. In the case of a massive\n(m0 6= 0) unit-wave, the integral theorem (240) could be regarded as an integral form of the equation \u0003\u03c80 + m20 \u03c80 = 0\nwith the energy-mass (dispersion) relation \u03c90 2 = k20 + m20 . Respectively, Eq. (240) could be considered as one of\nthe possible mathematical formulations of the Huygens-Fresnel principle for diffraction of the massive unit-wave on\nthe aperture. The expression (240) describes the unit-field \u03c80 (P, t) in any point P behind the screen by using the\nunit-field distribution \u03c80 (r\u2032\u2032 , t\u2032\u2032 ) with the amplitude a0 on the surface S of the aperture at the time moment t = t\u2032\u2032 .\nThe interaction of the unit-field with the material boundaries is described phenomenologically, namely in terms of\nthe boundary conditions imposed on the unit-field on the screen boundaries. The interaction is considered as an\nelastic process that does not change the absolute value |k0 | of the unit-field momentum. Thus the unit-fields (235)\nand (239) have the same value k0 of momentums, while the diffracted unit-field (240) does have the definite absolute\nvalue |k0 | with the indefinite direction k0 /|k0 | of propagation. In other words, the diffracted unit-field \u03c80 (P, t) is\n\u2032\u2032\n\u2032\u2032\nconsidered as the free unit-field \u03c80 (r\u2032\u2032 , t\u2032\u2032 ) = a0 ei(k0 r \u2212\u03c90 t ) reshaped by the aperture. The diffracted unit-field (240)\nhaving the definite absolute value |k0 | propagates in the uncertain direction within the interval determining by the\nHeisenberg uncertainty relation \u2206k0 \u2206x \u223c 1, where |\u2206x| is the aperture dimension. That gives the new physics inside\nthe Heisenberg uncertainty principle. The reshaping can be interpreted as the signalling (exchange of the information)\nbetween the points (x\u2032\u2032 , y \u2032\u2032 , z \u2032\u2032 ) and P . The signal from the point (x\u2032\u2032 , y \u2032\u2032 , z \u2032\u2032 ) to the point P of the unit-field (240)\npropagates in the form of the spherical wave R\u22121 ei(k0 R\u2212\u03c90 t) with the phase velocity v = \u03c90 /k0 = (1 + m20 /k20 )1/2 .\nIn the case of a non-relativistic particle (k0 \u2192 0), the signal propagates within the unit-field (240) with the phase\nvelocity v \u2192 \u221e. It should be stressed that the unit-field configuration (240) describes the indivisible unit-field. In\nother words, the unit-field (240) consists of the Huygens-Fresnel superposition of the spherical elementary waves,\nwhich are inseparable from each other. A simple analysis shows that the above-considered dynamics of the unit-field\n\n\f78\nconfiguration under the elastic collision of a unit-field with the material boundaries could be observed in many other\nexperimental conditions, for instance, in the Young two-slit experiment.\nConsider now the third typical example of the evolution of the unit-field configuration under the elastic interaction of\nthe single unit-field with a material boundary. Let me assume that the unit-field (235) with the amplitude a0 = V \u22121/2\nis placed into the center of an empty box, which has the volume Vb = L3b >> V and the \"non-transparent\" material\nboundaries. After the time t \u223c Lb /vg , the unit-field would interact with the box boundary. The elastic interaction\ncould be described phenomenologically by using the Neumann boundary condition imposed on the normal derivative\nof the unit-field function on the \"non-transparent\" boundaries. The elastic interaction of the unit-field with the box\nboundary results into the elastic reflection of the unit-field from the boundary that changes the momentum of the\nunit-field (235) from k0 to \u2212k0 . After the reflection along the normal to the surface, the unit-field propagates in the\ndirection \u2212k0 /k0 as the unit-wave\n\u03c80 (r, t) = a0 e\u2212i(k0 r\u2212\u03c90 t) .\n\n(241)\n\nThe reflection may be attributed to the phase change of the unit-field (235): a0 e\u2212i(k0 r\u2212\u03c90 t) = a0 ei(k0 r\u2212\u03c90 t\u00b1\u03c0) . The\ntotal time of the reflection is given by t \u223c V 1/3 /vg . The unit-fields (235) and (241) have the group and phase\nvelocities determined respectively by Eqs. (237) and (238). The localization (confinement) of the unit-field (235)\nby the \"non-transparent\" material box with the volume Vb = V = L3 results into the discretization of the unit-field\nmomentum k0 and frequency (energy) \u03c90 under the Dirichlet boundary conditions imposed on the unit-field on the\n\"non-transparent\" boundaries. In such a case, the unit-field could have one of the possible configurations\n\u03c80nml (r, t) = L\u22123/2 ei(k0nml r\u2212\u03c90nml t)\n\n(242)\n\nwith the squares of the wavenumber (momentum) and frequency (energy) given respectively by\nk20nml = (\u03c0/L)2 [n\u22122 + m\u22122 + l\u22122 ]\n\n(243)\n\n\u03c90mnl 2 = k20mnl + m20 ,\n\n(244)\n\nand\n\nwhere n, m and l are the non-zero integer numbers. The group and phase velocities of the unit-field (242) are\ndetermined by Eqs. (237) and (238) with the discrete momentum (243) and frequency (244). The localization\n(compression) of the unit-field (235) results also into the Heisenberg uncertainty relation (see, the relation (130)\nof Part I of the present study). The unit-field (242) does not include the reflected wave (241). That means that\nthe velocity of the box is equal to the group velocity of the unit-field. The well-known (standing-wave) configuration\n\u03c80nml (r, t) = (L\u22123/2 /2)[ei(k0nml r\u2212\u03c90nml t) +e\u2212i(k0nml r\u2212\u03c90nml t) ], which includes the reflected wave, has the group velocity\nvg = 0 corresponding to the zero momentum (236). The elastic reflection of a unit-field and the spectral discretization\nof the wavenumber (momentum) and energy (frequency) could be associated with many other experimental conditions,\nwhere a unit-field interacts with the resonator-like boundaries. Such a behaviour of the de Broglie (quantum) wave is\nwell-known in the canonical quantum mechanics.\nThe most unexpected behavior of a unit-field does associate with the superluminal values of the phase velocity\n(238) at the particular experimental conditions. In the case of k0 \u2192 0, a signal associated with the phase velocity\ncan propagate within the massive (m0 6= 0) unit-field with the infinite speed [v = (1 + m20 /k20 )1/2 \u2192 \u221e]. In the\nclassical (Young-type) diffraction experiment, any instant change of the unit-field boundaries by instant insertion of\nany additional object into the experiment should also result into superluminal modification of the diffracted nonrelativistic massive unit-field. The modification of the mass-less (m0 = 0) unit-field in such an experiment would\ntake place with the speed of light v = \u03c90 /k0 = c = 1. It should be stressed that the superluminal reshaping of a\nmassive unit-field, which is provided with the superluminal phase velocity within the unit-field, does not contradict\nthe Einstein special relativity. In the Einstein theory, the signaling between massive bodies (particles) separated by\nthe empty, \"straight\" spacetime is provided by a mass-less electromagnetic wave propagating between the particles\nwith the group speed of light. The superluminal reshaping of a massive unit-field with the superluminal phase velocity,\nwhich is somewhat similar to the instantaneous collapse of a wave function and the superluminar \"quantum leap\"\nin the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics, does not affect the signaling between massive particles\n(unit-fields) separated by the true vacuum. The Einstein signaling by a massive (m0 6= 0) particle is associated with\nthe group velocity (237) of the massive unit-fields (235) that is not superluminal [vg = 1/(1 + m20 /k20 )1/2 \u2264 1]. In\nagreement with the Einstein theory of relativity, any mass-less (m0 = 0) unit-field of the present model propagates\nthrough the true vacuum with the group velocity of light (vg = v = c = 1). Notice, any change of the boundaries placed\n\n\f79\ninfinitely far from the spatially finite unit-field would not affect the configuration and momentum of the unit-field.\nThe modification of a unit-field occurs only after interaction of the unit-field with the boundaries.\nThe signaling by the massive unit-field (235) associated with a massive (m0 6= 0) particle is provided with the\nvelocity (237) that could not be superluminal [vg = 1/(1 + m20 /k20 )1/2 \u2264 1]. In contrast to the Einstein theory of\npoint particles, the present model at the particular experimental conditions predicts the signalling by the material\nfield with the superluminal group velocity. For an example, the spatially evanescent unit-field\n\u03c80 (r, t) = a0 ei(k0 r\u2212\u03c90 t) = a0 e\u2212k\u03030 r e\u2212i\u03c90 t\n\n(245)\n\nsatisfies the equations of motion (190) and (227) under the dispersion relation\n\u03c90 2 = \u2212k\u030320 + m20 ,\n\n(246)\n\nwhich is formally indistinguishable from the Einstein mas-energy relation \u03c90 2 = k20 + m20 in the case of the imaginary\nmomentum k0 = ik\u03030 . The group velocity (237) of the unit-field (245) is given by\nvg = 1/(1 \u2212 m20 /k\u030320 )1/2 .\n\n(247)\n\nThe relativistic (k\u030320 \u2192 m20 ) unit-wave (245) propagates with the superluminal group velocity vg \u2192 \u221e. The relativistic\nunit-field\n\u03c80 (r, t) = a0 ei(k0 r\u2212\u03c90 t) = a0 e\u2212k\u03030 r e\u2212\u03c9\u03030 t ,\n\n(248)\n\nwhich is evanescent in both the space and time, also propagates with the superluminal group velocity (247) under the\ndispersion relation\n\u03c9\u030302 = k\u030320 \u2212 m20 .\n\n(249)\n\nThe dispersion (249) formally satisfies the Einstein mas-energy relation \u03c90 2 = k20 + m20 for the imaginary momentum k0 = ik\u03030 and frequency \u03c90 = \u2212i\u03c9\u03030 . The evanescent unit-field (unit-wave), which has the imaginary values\nof the frequency (energy) and/or wave-number (momentum), does associate with the particle that may propagate\nwith the superluminal group velocity. It could be mention that superluminal particles are usually called tachions.\nThe dispersion relations (246) and (249), strictly speaking, are different from the Einstein mass-energy relation (183)\nassociated with the real frequency (energy), wave-number (momentum) and mass. Moreover, the temporal evanescence (virtual existence) of the unit-field (248) associated with the disappearing particle does contradict the law of\nenergy conservation. Therefore the superluminal unit-fields (245) and (248) and the respective superluminal particles\n(tachions) probably do not really exist. Nevertheless, the superluminal field \u03c8(r, t), which is similar to the unit-field\n(245) or (248), may be created experimentally by using the method of Fourier's decomposition. In such a case, the\ncomposite-field \u03c8(r, t) = \u03a3i ai \u03c80i (r, t) having the superluminal field configuration is composed from the Fourier components (non-evanescent unit-fields \u03c80i (r, t) associated with the temporally non-evanescent particles) that satisfy the\nEinstein mas-energy relation \u03c90i 2 = k20i + m20i with the real values \u03c90i , k0i and m0i . The temporal evanescence of the\nsuperluminal configuration associated with the field superposition \u03a3i ai \u03c80i (r, t) is provided rather by redistribution of\nthe non-evanescent unit-fields ai \u03c80i (r, t) than the disappearance of these unit-fields (particles). The signalling by the\ncomposite, evanescent field (wave) having the superluminal group velocity could play important role in explanation\nof the many superluminal physical processes, such as the near-field diffraction (scattering) of waves, the tunnelling\neffects and the virtual-particle phenomena of any kind. It could be also mentioned that the superluminal signaling\nby the relativistic neutrinos has been recently observed in the CERN-LNGS experiment. The superlunimal signaling\nin this experiment, if such a behavior really exists, may be attributed to the superluminal group velocity (vg > 1) of\nthe composite evanescent field associated with the neutrinos.\n4. UNIFICATION OF INTERACTING ELEMENTARY PARTICLES AND INTERFERING\n(CROSS-CORRELATING) UNIT-FIELDS: A MULTI-PARTICLE SYSTEM (N \u2265 2)\n\nIn the above-presented conceptual model, a single elementary particle that is free from interaction with other\nparticles has been presented as the free, indivisible unit-field associated with this particle. Unification of a free particle\nand a free unit-field was performed by the generalization of the energy-mass relation \u03b52 = k2 + m2 of the Einstein\ntheory of a point particle to the case of the unit-field associated with the particle. Then the generalized mass-energy\n\n\f80\nrelation yielded the equation of motion for the unit-field. A unit-field was considered to be free if it interacts with\nthe boundaries imposed by the free space (vacuum), only. It was also shown that the elastic interaction of a unit-field\nwith the material boundaries can be treated phenomenologically by using the different boundary conditions for the\nequation of motion of a free unit-field (particle). In contrast to a free particle, the analysis of non-elastic interaction of\na unit-field (particle) with material boundaries or another unit-field (particle) requires a detailed (microscopic) model\nof interaction of the unit-fields with each other. Section 4 unifies the fundamental (electromagnetic, weak, strong and\ngravitational) fields, particles and interactions by the further generalization of the Einstein energy-mass relation for\nthe interacting P\nparticles and bodies composed from the interfering unit-fields. It is assumed that any fundamental\nN\nfield \u03c8(r, t) = n=1 \u03c80n (r, t) is composed from the interfering, indivisible unit-fields \u03c80n (r, t) associated with the\ninteracting elementary particles. Section 4 begins the unification with the generalization of the Einstein energy-mass\nrelation for the composite field \u03c8(r, t) = \u03c801 (r, t) + \u03c802 (r, t) associated with the composite particle composed from\ntwo (N = 2) indistinguishable elementary particles. Then the generalization of the Einstein energy-mass relation is\nperformed for an arbitrary number N of the unit-fields (elementary particles). Mathematically, the generalization of\nthe Einstein energy-mass relation is performed by using the second or first derivatives of a unit-field. Although these\ntwo approaches are equivalent in the case of the de Broglie wave associated with a free particle, the use of the second or\nfirst derivatives may give the different results for the interfering unit-fields. For the sake of generality, the unification\nof interacting elementary particles and interfering (cross-correlating) unit-fields is presented also in the alternative\nform by using the composite-field Lagrangian (Hamiltonian) that corresponds to the generalized energy-mass relation\nfor the interfering unit-fields. In such a case, the model is formulated in the frame of the Lagrangian formalism,\nwhere the configuration and dynamics of the composite field is determined by the composite-field Lagrangian and the\nEuler-Lagrange equation of motion with the initial and boundary conditions imposed.\n4.1. The energy-mass relation and equation of motion for a composite particle composed from interacting\npoint-like particles: Interaction as cross-correlation (interference) of point-like particles\n\nFor the sake of simplicity, let me first consider the simplest composite particle, namely the point-like particle\ncomposed from two point-particles of the Einstein theory of special relativity. It is assumed that the first pointlike elementary particle has the mass m01 , momentum k01 and energy \u03b501 in the spacetime point (r1 , t1 ). The\nsecond elementary particle is characterized by the respective parameters m02 , k02 , \u03b502 and (r2 , t2 ). In the case of\n(r1 , t1 ) = (r2 , t2 ) = (r, t), the two identical [m01 = m02 = m0 and k01 = k02 = k0 ] point-particles could be considered\nas the degenerate, composite point-particle with the common energy \u03b5 determining by the energy superposition\nprinciple:\n\u03b5 = \u03b501 + \u03b502 .\n\n(250)\n\nThe Einstein energy-mass relation (183) for the degenerate, composite particle is given by\n\u03b52 = k2 + m2 ,\n\n(251)\n\nwhere the values \u03b5 = \u03b501 + \u03b502 = 2\u03b50 , k = k01 + k02 = 2k0 and m = m01 + m02 = 2m0 are respectively the\nsums (superpositions) of the energies, momentums and rest-masses of the first and second particles. That means\nthat the particles satisfy the superposition principle also for the momentums and masses. In the degenerate particle,\nthe energies, momentums and rest-masses of the indistinguishable particles are additive. The basic relation (251)\nof Einstein's relativity for the degenerate, composite point-particle located in the spatiotemporal point (r, t) can be\nrewritten as\n\u03b52 = \u03b5201 + \u03b5202 + E12 + E21 = \u03b5201 + \u03b5202 + E12,21 .\n\n(252)\n\nHere, \u03b5 \u2261 \u03b5(r, t) is the common energy of the composite particle, and \u03b501 \u2261 \u03b501 (r, t) = (k201 + m201 )1/2 and \u03b502 \u2261\n\u03b502 (r, t) = (k202 + m202 )1/2 denote respectively the Einstein relativistic energies of the first and second particles. The\nvalue E12,21 (r, t) = E12 (r, t) + E21 (r, t) logically to call the total cross-correlation term or simply the cross-correlation\nterm. The term associates with the cross-correlation (\"interference\") of the two point-particles in the spatiotemporal\npoint (r, t). The first cross-correlation term E12 (r, t) = \u03b501 (r, t)\u03b502 (r, t) and the second one E21 (r, t) = \u03b502 (r, t)\u03b501 (r, t)\nassociated respectively with the first and second point-particles satisfy the relation\nE12 = E21 = (1/2)E12,21 .\n\n(253)\n\n\f81\nThe relation (252) may be represented formally even in the more general form by using the notations \u03b5 \u2261 \u03b5(r1 , r2 , t1 , t2 ),\n\u03b51 \u2261 \u03b501 (r1 , t1 ) = (k201 + m201 )1/2 , \u03b52 \u2261 \u03b502 (r2 , t2 ) = (k202 + m202 )1/2 and E12,21 \u2261 E12,21 (r1 , r2 , t1 , t2 ) =\n\u03b501 (r1 , t1 )\u03b502 (r2 , t2 ) + \u03b502 (r2 , t2 )\u03b501 (r1 , t1 ), where the cross-correlation term E12,21 (r1 , r2 , t1 , t2 ) does associate with\nthe cross-correlation of the two particles in the points r1 , r2 , t1 and t2 . It should be stressed, however, that Eq. (252)\ncould be used only in the case of the indistinguishable (m01 = m02 = m0 and k01 = k02 = k0 ) point-like particles\nlocated in the same spacetime point (r1 , t1 ) = (r2 , t2 ) = (r, t). Otherwise Eq. (252) does not have any physical sense.\nAlthough the cross-correlation term E12,21 = \u03b501 \u03b502 + \u03b502 \u03b501 can be introduced formally into the Einstein energy-mass\nrelation (see, Eq. 252), the cross-correlation term does not play any important role in the Einstein theory of special\nrelativity. The cross-correlation term E12,21 = \u03b501 \u03b502 + \u03b502 \u03b501 associated with the square of energies in Eq. (252)\ndoes not result (\u03b5 6= \u03b501 + \u03b502 + \u03b512,21 , where \u03b512,21 6= 0) into the cross-correlation of energies [see, Eq. (250)]. That\nis to say that the Einstein special relativity describes the particles, which are free (\u03b512,21 = 0) from the interaction\n(cross-correlation) energies. The cross-correlation (\"interference\") between the energies of point-particles does appear\nin the relativistic and non-relativistic theories of the interacting point-particles in the form of the interaction (potential) energy \u03b512,21 6= 0. Indeed, in the all relativistic theories of interacting particles based on the Einstein theory of\nspecial relativity, the common (total) energy \u03b5 of the composite point-particle composed at the time moment t from\nthe interacting point-particles is presented as\n\u03b5(r1 , r2 , t) = \u03b501 (r1 , t) + \u03b502 (r2 , t) + \u03b512 (|r1 \u2212 r2 |, t) + \u03b521 (|r2 \u2212 r1 |, t)\n\n(254)\n\n\u03b5(r1 , r2 , t) = \u03b501 (r1 , t) + \u03b502 (r2 , t) + \u03b512,21 (|r1 \u2212 r2 |, t),\n\n(255)\n\nor\n\nwhere the values \u03b501 (r1 , t) = (k201 + m201 )1/2 and \u03b502 (r2 , t) = (k202 + m202 )1/2 denote respectively the relativistic energies\nof the first and second point-particles; the cross-correlation energy \u03b512,21 (|r1 \u2212 r2 |, t) = \u03b512 (|r1 \u2212 r2 |, t)+ \u03b521 (|r2 \u2212 r1 |, t)\ndenotes the interaction energy associated with the four fundamental interactions of nature, namely the gravitation,\nelectromagnetism, weak interaction and strong interaction. One should not confuse here the cross-correlation energy\n\u03b512,21 (r1 , r2 , t), which associates with the cross-correlation in the energies of two particles, with the cross-correlation\nterm E12,21 (r1 , r2 , t) attributed to the cross-correlation in the square of energies. The interaction energy \u03b512,21 (|r1 \u2212\nr2 |, t) is considered as the cross-correlation (\"interference\") energy \u03b512,21 (r1 , r2 , t) = \u03b512,21 (|r1 \u2212 r2 |, t) that does\nassociate with the cross-correlation (\"interference\") of the two point-particles in the spatiotemporal points (r1 , t) and\n(r2 , t). The energies \u03b512 and \u03b521 , which are attributed respectively to the cross-correlation of the first particle with\nthe second one and vice versa, satisfy the relation\n\u03b512 = \u03b521 = (1/2)\u03b512,21 ,\n\n(256)\n\nwhere \u03b512,21 6= 0. In the non-relativistic (k201 << m201 ) theories, the common energy \u03b5 of the composite point-particle\ncomposed from the interacting point-particles is given by Eq. (255), where the non-relativistic energies of the first\nk2\nk2\nk2\n(\u03b501 \u2248 2m0101 + m01 ) and second (\u03b502 \u2248 2m0202 + m02 ) point-particles are replaced by the energies \u03b51 = \u03b501 \u2212 m01 = 2m0101\nk2\n\nand \u03b52 = \u03b502 \u2212m02 = 2m0202 , respectively. In the non-relativistic and relativistic cases, the cross-correlation (interaction)\nenergy \u03b512,21 (|r1 \u2212 r2 |, t) may have the same or different forms. The gradients of the interaction (cross-correlation)\nenergy \u03b512,21 (|r1 \u2212 r2 |, t), which are called the interaction forces, are given by\n\u2202\n\u03b512,21 (|R12 |, t)\n\u2202R12\n\n(257)\n\n\u2202\n\u03b512,21 (|R21 |, t),\n\u2202R21\n\n(258)\n\nF12 (r1 , t) = \u2212\nand\nF21 (r2 , t) = \u2212\n\nwhere R12 = r1 \u2212 r2 and R21 = r2 \u2212 r1 . The interaction forces F12 and F21 , which could be considered as the\ncross-correlation (\"interference\") forces, act respectively upon the first and second point-particles. The interaction\n(cross-correlation) forces satisfy the relation\nF12 = \u2212F21 .\n\n(259)\n\ndue to the relation R12 = \u2212R21 . The physical action of the first particle onto the second particle is indivisible from\nthe action the second particle onto the first one. That is to say that the energy \u03b512 is indivisible and indistinguishable\n\n\f82\nfrom the energy \u03b521 . Therefore the interactive force F12 can not exist without existence of the interactive force F21 .\nThe kind of the interaction (cross-correlation) force acting between the two point-particles is determined by the kind of\ninteraction (cross-correlation) energy and vice versa. Equations (257) and (258) do determine the four fundamental\n(ggravitational, electromagnetic, weak and strong) forces by the two components\n\u03b512 = (1/2)\u03b512,21\n\n(260)\n\n\u03b521 = (1/2)\u03b512,21\n\n(261)\n\nand\n\nof the interaction (cross-correlation) energy \u03b512,21 , where the energy \u03b512,21 is associated with the gravitational, electromagnetic, weak and strong interactions. The energy of cross-correlation (interaction) and the respective force depend\non the masses, charges, isospins, momentums and spins of the particles. Correspondingly, the kind of the point-like\nelementary particle is characterized by the mass, charge (electric charge, weak hyper-charge or color charge), weak\nisospin and intrinsic angular momentum (spin) of the particle. The equation of motion for the composite particle\nis derived by assuming that the variation of the energy [\u03b501 (r1 , t) + \u03b502 (r2 , t)] is related to the variation of the total\ninteraction (cross-correlation) energy \u03b512,21 (|r1 \u2212 r2 |, t) as\n\u03b4[\u03b501 (r1 , t) + \u03b502 (r2 , t)] = \u2212\u03b4\u03b512,21 (|r1 \u2212 r2 |, t)\n\n(262)\n\nThe relation (262) is associated with the conservation of energy at the time moment t, where the variation of interaction\n(cross-correlation) energy \u03b4\u03b512,21 (|r1 \u2212r2 |, t) is converted into the variation of the Einstein energy \u03b4[\u03b501 (r1 , t)+\u03b502 (r2 , t)]\nand vice versa. Notice, the two point-particles could be considered as the free particles that does not associate with\nthe compose particle if \u03b512,21 (|r1 \u2212 r2 |, t) << [\u03b501 (r1 , t) + \u03b502 (r2 , t)]. Equation (262) yields the equation of motion,\nwhich can be presented in the general form as\n\u2202\u03b501 (r1 , t)\n\u2202\u03b502 (r2 , t)\n\u2202\u03b501 (r1 , t)\n\u2202\u03b502 (r2 , t)\ndr1 +\ndr2 +\ndt +\ndt =\n\u2202r1\n\u2202r2\n\u2202t\n\u2202t\n\u2202\u03b512,21 (|r1 \u2212 r2 |, t)\n\u2202\u03b512,21 (|r1 \u2212 r2 |, t)\n\u2202\u03b512,21 (|r1 \u2212 r2 |, t)\n\u2202\u03b512,21 (|r1 \u2212 r2 |, t)\ndr1 \u2212\ndr2 \u2212\ndt \u2212\ndt.\n=\u2212\n\u2202r1\n\u2202r2\n\u2202t\n\u2202t\n\n(263)\n\nThe equation of motion (263) may be simplified in some particular cases. For an example, in the case of\n\u03b4[\u03b501 (r1 , t) + \u03b502 (r2 , t)] = \u2212\u03b4\u03b512,21 (|r1 \u2212 r2 |, t) = 0,\n\n(264)\n\nEq. (263) describes the stationary condition of the composite particle in which the total energy \u03b5(r1 , r2 , t), the total\ninteraction (cross-correlation) energy \u03b512,21 (|r1 \u2212r2 |, t) and the Einstein energy [\u03b501 (r1 , t)+\u03b502 (r2 , t)] of point-particles\ndo not depend on the time moment t. In other words, the stationary composite particle has the constant energies\n\u03b5(r1 , r2 ), \u03b512,21 (|r1 \u2212 r2 |), \u03b501 (r1 ) and \u03b502 (r2 ). Another typical example that associates with the composite particle is\nthe movement of the first particle in the coordinate system, where the second particle is at the rest. In such a case,\nEq. (263) yields the equation of motion for the first particle:\n\u2202k01 (r1 , t)\n= F12 (r1 , t),\n\u2202t\n\n(265)\n\nwhere the interaction (cross-correlation) force acting upon the particle is given by\nF12 (r1 , t) = \u2212\n\n\u2202\n\u03b512,21 (|r1 |, t).\n\u2202r1\n\n(266)\n\nIt should be stressed that Eqs. (254) - (266) in the case of gravitational interaction are valid for the Newton gravitation,\nbut do not compare well with the Einstein general relativity. Indeed, the gravitational interaction between two\nparticles in the Einstein relativity is not viewed as an interaction force mediated by the gradient of the interaction\n(cross-correlation) energy, but rather particles moving freely in gravitational fields travel under their own inertia in\nstraight lines through \"curve\" spacetime. In other words, the force of gravity and the potential energy of gravitational\ninteraction are explained as the pure geometrical result attributed to the geometry of spacetime.\nThe above-presented analysis, which considers the energies and forces associated with the two elementary pointparticles, is valid also in the case of a composite particle composed from the N > 2 point-particles. I will not\n\n\f83\npresent the multi-particle (N > 2) analysis, because the equations that correspond to Eqs. (250) - (266) for N > 2\nare well-known. Let me only mention several facts associated with the degenerate point-particle composed from the\narbitrary number N of the indistinguishable, interaction-less point-particles of the Einstein special relativity. The\nsquares of energy, momentum and mass of the degenerate particle are given respectively by \u03b52 = N 2 \u03b520 , k2 = N 2 k20\nand m2 = N 2 m20 , where \u03b520 = k20 + m20 . Notice, the energy \u03b5 = N \u03b50 , momentum k = N k0 and mass m = N m0 of the\ndegenerate particle is similar to the energy and momentum of the N bosons of the global infinite field describing by\nthe Klein-Gordon-Fock equation of quantum field theory.\n4.2. The energy-mass relation and equation of motion for the interfering (cross-correlating) unit-fields\nassociated with elementary particles\n4.2.1. The model based on the 2nd derivatives of the composite field\n\n1. The model 1st-version based on the straightforward generalization of the Einstein energy-mass relation for the\ncomposite field by using the 2nd derivatives\nThe spatially-finite or infinite unit-fields \u03c801 (r1 , t1 ) and \u03c802 (r2 , t2 ) associated with the 1st and the 2nd elementary\nparticles are not the Einstein point-like particles with the spateotemporal coordinates (r1 , t1 ) and (r2 , t2 ). Therefore\nEqs. (250) - (252) should be generalized for the arbitrary spacetime coordinates (r1 , t1 ) and (r2 , t2 ) of the composite\nfield \u03c8 = \u03c8(r1 , r2 , t1 , t2 ) composed from the unit-fields \u03c801 (r1 , t1 ) and \u03c802 (r2 , t2 ). The common energy \u03b5 of the\ncomposite particle may be attributed to the composite field \u03c8(r1 , r2 , t1 , t2 ) = \u03c801 (r1 , t1 ) + \u03c802 (r2 , t2 ) only in the case\nof t1 = t2 = t. Indeed, the cross-correlation of the unit-fields \u03c801 (r1 , t1 ) and \u03c802 (r2 , t2 ) at the different (t1 6= t2 )\ntime moments, in the common or different inertial coordinate systems, does associate rather with the amplitude or\nintensity interferometry (see, Part I) than the cross-correlation term \u03b512,21 of the common energy \u03b5 of the composite\nparticle. At the time moment t of the inertial coordinate system, which is the common system for the first and second\nunit-fields, the composite field \u03c8(r1 , r2 , t) may be presented as the field \u03c8(r, t) = \u03c801 (r1 , t) + \u03c802 (r2 , t) with the\ndifferent (r1 6= r2 ) space coordinates. The common field that has the common temporal coordinate may be presented\nalso as the field \u03c8(r, t) = \u03c801 (r, t) + \u03c802 (r, t) with the common (r1 = r2 = r) space coordinate. The common field\n\u03c8(r, t) composed from the identical unit-fields \u03c801 (r, t) \u2261 \u03c8(r1 , t) and \u03c802 (r, t) \u2261 \u03c8(r2 , t) associated with the particles\nhas the form\n\u03c8(r, t) = \u03c8(r1 , t) + \u03c8(r2 , t) = \u03c801 (r, t) + \u03c802 (r, t).\n\n(267)\n\nNotice, the composite field (267) is in agreement with the field superposition principle (see, Part I). The field superposition principle may be interpreted as a particular form of the energy superposition principle \u03b5 = \u03b501 + \u03b502 for two\npoint particles, which are considered as the composite particle with the common energy \u03b5 determining by the energy\nsuperposition principle \u03b5 = \u03b501 + \u03b502 .\nThe generalization of the Einstein energy-mass relation (183) for the composite field (267) of the physical matter,\nwhich is associated with the energies and masses of the first and second particles in the common volume V , is perform\nby the replacement\n\u03c80 (r, t) \u2192 \u03c8(r, t),\n\n(268)\n\nwhere the unit-field \u03c80 (r, t) is replaced by the composite field (267) in the all equations of Sec. 3 that include the\nfield \u03c80 (r, t). This procedure first yields the replacements\n\u03c8 \u03070 (r, t) \u2192 [\u03c8\u030701 (r, t) + \u03c8\u030702 (r, t)]\n\n(269)\n\n\u2207\u03c80 (r, t) \u2192 [\u2207\u03c801 (r, t) + \u2207\u03c802 (r, t)]\n\n(270)\n\nand\n\nand then leads to the energy-mass relation with the respective equation of motion for the composite field associated\nwith the composite particle.\nFor the superposition (267), the replacements (268) - (270) in Eqs. (185) - (189) yielded the energy-mass relation\n\u03b52 = \u03b5201 + \u03b5202 + E12 + E21 = \u03b5201 + \u03b5202 + E12,21 ,\n\n(271)\n\n\f84\nwhere\n1\n=\n2\n\nZ\n\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u2217\n\u03c801\n\u2212\u03c8\u030801 \u2212 \u22072 \u03c801 + m20 \u03c801 d3 x,\n\n(272)\n\n\u03b5202 =\n\n1\n2\n\nZ\n\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u2217\n\u2212\u03c8\u030802 \u2212 \u22072 \u03c802 + m20 \u03c802 d3 x,\n\u03c802\n\n(273)\n\nE12 =\n\n1\n2\n\nZ\n\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u2217\n\u03c801\n\u2212\u03c8\u030802 \u2212 \u22072 \u03c802 + m20 \u03c802 d3 x,\n\n(274)\n\nE21 =\n\n1\n2\n\nZ\n\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u2217\n\u2212\u03c8\u030801 \u2212 \u22072 \u03c801 + m20 \u03c801 d3 x,\n\u03c802\n\n(275)\n\n\u03b5201\n\nV\n\nV\n\nV\n\nV\n\nand E12,21 \u2261 E12 + E21 . One can easily demonstrate the very important inequality E12,21 \u2264 \u03b5201 + \u03b5202 associated with\nthe interaction of two unit-fields (particles). Notice, Eq. (271) is indistinguishable from Eq. (252).

Physical properties of a composite particle based on the generalized energy-mass relation for the\ncomposite field\n\n1. The interaction energies and forces associated with the relativistic and non-relativistic interfering (crosscorrelating) unit-fields\nThe above-presented models (Secs. 4.1. and 4.2.) are based on the generalization of the energy-mass relation of\nthe Einstein special relativity, where the kind of an elementary particle is characterized only by its mass. Section 4.2.\nhas presented a composite particle of the Einstein special relativity as the composite field, where the unit-fields of the\ncomposite field do associate with the massive (m0n = m0 6= 0) or mass-less (m0n = m0 = 0) elementary particles of\nthe Einstein relativity. In the case of the relativistic composite field (267) satisfying the condition\nE12,21 = \u03b501 \u03b502 + \u03b502 \u03b501 ,\n\n(345)\n\nthe relativistic mass-energy relations (271), (304) and (325) correspond to the relativistic energy-mass relation (252)\nattributed to the two particles. If the the total cross-correlation term is given by\nE12,21 6= \u03b501 \u03b502 + \u03b502 \u03b501 ,\n\n(346)\n\nthen the comparison of the mass-energy relations (271), (304) and (325) with the energy-mass relation (252) indicates\nunambiguously existence of the interaction (non-zero cross-correlation) between the two unit-fields (particles). The\nfurther comparison of the total energy determining by the mass-energy relations (271), (304) and (325) with the total\nenergy (254) or (255) attributed to the interacting particles yields the total interaction (cross-correlation) energy\n\u03b512,21 = (\u03b5201 + \u03b5202 + E12,21 )1/2 \u2212 (\u03b501 + \u03b502 ),\n\n(347)\n\nwhere the total cross-correlation term\nE12,21 = 2E12 = 2E21 \u2264 \u03b5201 + \u03b5202\n\n(348)\n\nis determined by Eqs. (274), (275), (294), (295), (307), (308), (328) and (329). The gradient of the interaction energy\n\u03b512,21 attributed to both the first and second point-particles satisfy the relation\n\u03b512,21 = 2\u03b512 = 2\u03b521 ,\n\n(349)\n\nwhere \u03b512,21 6= 0 is given by Eq. (347). The gradients of the interaction (cross-correlation) energies \u03b512 and \u03b521\ndetermining by Eqs.

The forces satisfy the relation\nF12 (r1 , t) = \u2212F21 (r2 , t).\n\n(352)\n\nIt should be stressed that Eqs. (347) - (352) are valid for both the strong-relativistic (\u03b5201 + \u03b5202 \u223c E12,21 ) and\nweak-relativistic (E12,21 << \u03b5201 + \u03b5202 ) interactions. In the case of the weak-relativistic interaction, which is the typical\nsituation in the most of physical experiments, Eq. (347) simplifies to the equation\n\u03b512,21 \u2248 (\u03b5201 \u2212 \u03b501 ) + (\u03b5202 \u2212 \u03b502 ) + (1/2)E12,21 ,\n\n(353)\n\nwhich yields the weak-relativistic interaction (cross-correlation) forces\nF12 (r1 , t) \u2248 \u2212\n\n1 \u2202\nE12,21 (|R12 |, t)\n2 \u2202R12\n\n(354)\n\n\f91\nand\nF21 (r2 , t) \u2248\n\n1 \u2202\nE12,21 (|R12 |, t),\n2 \u2202R12\n\n(355)\n\nThe interaction between the 1st and 2nd interacting elementary unit-fields (particles) results into the attraction or\nrepelling of the unit-fields (particles) characterizing by the interactive forces (350), (351), (354) and (355) that have\nthe absolute values and directions. In the case of the negative values \u03b512 (|r|, t), \u03b521 (|r|, t), E12 (|r|, t) and E21 (|r|, t),\nthe interactive forces (350), (351), (354) and (355) are attractive. The interactive forces (350), (351), (354) and (355)\nare repulsive if the cross-correlation parameters \u03b512 (|r|, t), \u03b521 (|r|, t), E12 (|r|, t) and E21 (|r|, t) have the positive values.\nIn Eqs. (347) - (355), one should not confuse the strong-relativistic and weak-relativistic interactions with the weak\nand strong interactions of SM.\nIn the case of the non-relativistic composite field (267) composed from the two interfering (cross-correlating) nonrelativistic unit-fields, the comparison of the non-relativistic mass-energy relations (282), (315) and (335) with the\nnon-relativistic energy-mass relation (254) or (255) attributed to the two interacting, non-relativistic particles yielded\nthe total non-relativistic cross-correlation (interaction) energy\n\u03b512,21 = \u03b512 + \u03b512 ,\n\n(356)\n\nwhere the non-relativistic cross-correlation (interaction) energies \u03b512 = (1/2)\u03b512,21 and \u03b521 = (1/2)\u03b512,21 associated\nwith the first and the second non-relativistic unit-fields (particles) are determined by the non-relativistic equations\n(286), (287), (300), (301), (319), (320), (339) and (340). The non-relativistic interaction (cross-correlation) forces\nF12 (r, t) and F21 (r, t) are determined by Eqs. (350) - (352), where the gradients of the interaction (cross-correlation)\nenergies \u03b512 and \u03b521 are calculated by using the relations (286), (287), (300) (301), (319), (320), (339) and (340).\nThe above presented analysis of the two interfering unit-fields (particles) is valid for any number N of the interfering\nunit-fields (particles) of the composite field (particle). In the case of N > 2, one can easily demonstrate that Eqs.\n(345) - (356) describe the interaction (cross-correlation) of unit-fields (particles) in the each pair of the unit-fields\n(particles).\n2. The probability density, energy and effective number of the relativistic and non-relativistic interfering (crosscorrelating) unit-fields and their connection with the Euler-Lagrange and Hamilton-Jacoby formalisms\nThe interaction (cross-correlation) relations (345) - (356) have been derived by using the two equivalent versions\nPN\nof the model of a composite field (particle) \u03c8(r, t) =\nn=1 \u03c80n (r, t). The 1st and 2nd model versions are based\non the straightforward generalization of the Einstein energy-mass relation for the interfering unit-fields by using\nrespectively the 1st and 2nd derivatives of the unit-fields. The model versions have been presented also in the more\ngeneral form by using the Euler-Lagrange formalism. In addition, it was demonstrated that the model versions can be\neasily rewritten in the frame of the Hamilton-Jacoby formalism by using the Hamiltonians H0n of the unit-field \u03c80n .\nIt should be stressed that the Euler-Lagrange and Hamilton-Jacoby formalisms for the the single interference-free\nunit-field \u03c80n (r, t) is based on the normalization\nZ\n\u2217\n\u03c80n\n\u03c80n d3 x = 1,\n(357)\nV\n\nwhich could give rise to the probabilistic (\"Copenhagen quantum-mechanical\") interpretation of the unit-field (unit\u2217\nwave) \u03c80n associated with the n-th single particle, where the value \u03c80n\n\u03c80n is interpreted as the probability density\nto find the single particle in the spacetime point (r, t). However, unlike in the canonical quantum mechanics based\non the quantum-mechanical (non-material) wave-function \u03c80n (r, t) describing a material point-particle located in the\n\u2217\nspatiotemporal point (r, t) with the probability density \u03c80n\n(r, t)\u03c80n (r, t), the material unit-field (particle) \u03c80n (r, t)\nassociated with the particle mass-energy does really exist in the each spatiotemporal point (r, t) of the unit-field. That\nis the principal difference between the canonical (probabilistic) quantum mechanics and the present model (See, Sec.\nP\n3.2.). The material composite field \u03c8(r, t) = N\nn=1 \u03c80n (r, t) associated with the composite-particle mass and energy\nalso really exists in the each spatiotemporal point (r, t) of the composite field. The composite field \u03c8(r, t) obeys the\ninequality\nZ\n\u03c8 \u2217 \u03c8d3 x 6= 1,\n(358)\nV\n\n\f92\nwhich is not consistent with the normalization (200) of the single interference-free unit-field \u03c80n . Therefore the composite field \u03c8 (composite particle) could not be associated with the fields (waves) of probabilities of the \"Copenhagen\"\n(canonical) quantum mechanics. The non-probabilistic interpretation of the composite field does not contradict the\ntraditional quantum field theories, which also do not use the concept of the fields (waves) of probabilities.\nConsider now the energy and number of the relativistic and non-relativistic interfering (cross-correlating) unit-fields\nand their connection with the Hamilton formalism of Part I of the present study. In the relativistic case, the relativistic\nHamiltonian H01 of a unit-field (particle) is associated with the unit-field energy squared:\nH01 = \u03b5201 ,\n\n(359)\n\nwhere \u03b5201 = k201 + m201 . The relativistic Hamiltonian H of the composite field (particle) composed from the N\nunit-fields (particles) is attributed to the total field-energy squared:\nH = \u03b52 ,\n\n(360)\n\nwhere\nH=\n\n2\n\nN\nX\n\nn=1\n\n\u03b5 =\n\nHnn +\n\nN\nX\n\nn=1\n\n\u03b520n\n\n+\n\n2\nNX\n\u2212N\n\nHnm ,\n\n(361)\n\n2\nNX\n\u2212N\n\nEnm ,\n\n(362)\n\nn6=m\n\nn6=m\n\nHnn = \u03b520n\n\n(363)\n\nHnm = Enm\n\n(364)\n\nand\n\nHere, the values \u03b520n are calculated by using Eqs. (279), (296), (312) and (332), where the cross-correlation term Enm\nis determined by Eqs. (280), (297), (313)and (333). One can easily demonstrate that the physical parameters of the\ninterfering relativistic unit-fields (particles) are described by the energy \u03b5 in the energy interval\n0 \u2264 \u03b5 \u2264 N \u03b501\n\n(365)\n\nwith the particle relativistic energy \u03b501 = [k201 + m201 ]1/2 and the effective number N = \u03b5/\u03b501 of particles in the\nnumber interval\n0 \u2264 N \u2264 N.\n\n(366)\n\nIf the relativistic identical unit-fields add coherently, then the composite-field energy and effective number of the\nunit-fields do scale as the number of unit-fields (particles):\n\u03b5 = N \u03b501\n\n(367)\n\nN = N.\n\n(368)\n\nand\n\nIn the non-relativistic case, the non-relativistic Hamiltonian H01 of a unit-field (particle) is attributed to the unit-field\nenergy:\nH01 = \u03b501 ,\n\n(369)\nk2\n\nwhere the the non-relativistic particle energy \u03b501 is given by Eq. (191) as \u03b501 = 2m0101 + m01 . The non-relativistic\nHamiltonian H of the composite field (particle) composed from the N unit-fields (particles) is attributed to the total\nfield-energy\nH=\u03b5\n\n(370)\n\n\f93\nwith\nH=\n\n\u03b5=\n\nN\nX\n\nn=1\n\nHnn +\n\nN\nX\n\nn=1\n\n\u03b50n +\n\n2\nNX\n\u2212N\n\nn6=m\n\n2\nNX\n\u2212N\n\nHnm ,\n\n(371)\n\n\u03b5nm ,\n\n(372)\n\nn6=m\n\nHnn = \u03b50n\n\n(373)\n\nHnm = \u03b5nm ,\n\n(374)\n\nand\n\nwhere the unit-field energy \u03b5nm is determined by Eqs. (290), (302), (323) and (343), where the cross-correlation\n(interaction) energy \u03b5nm is calculated by using Eqs. (291), (303), (324) and (344). The energy of the cross-correlating\nnon-relativistic unit-fields is then given by\n0 \u2264 H \u2264 N 2 \u03b501\nwith the particle energy \u03b501 =\n\nk201\n2m01\n\n(375)\n\n+ m01 and the respective effective number\n0 \u2264 N \u2264 N2\n\n(376)\n\nof the unit-fields (particles). If the identical unit-fields add coherently, then the composite-field energy and effective\nnumber of the unit-fields do scale as the number of unit-fields (particles) squared:\n\u03b5 = N 2 \u03b501\n\n(377)\n\nN = N 2.\n\n(378)\n\nand\n\nNotice, the squares of energy, momentum and mass of the degenerate, composite field \u03c8(r, t) = N \u03c801 (r, t) associated\nwith the degenerate, composite particle is given respectively by \u03b52 = N 2 \u03b5201 , k2 = N 2 k20 and m2 = N 2 m201 , where\n\u03b5201 = k201 + m201 . The energy \u03b5 = N \u03b501 , momentum k = N k01 and mass m = N m01 of the degenerate field (particle)\nis similar to the energy and momentum of the N bosons of the global infinite field of bosons describing by the\nKlein-Gordon-Fock equation of quantum field theory.\nPart I of the present study has used the Hamiltonian-energy relation H = \u03b5(k) of the traditional quantum field theory,\nwhere the relativistic Hamiltonian H01 is associated with the relativistic particle energy as H01 = \u03b501 = (k201 +m201 )1/2 .\nIn such a case, the relativistic Hamiltonian H of the field composed from the N unit-fields (particles) is associated\nPN\nPN 2 \u2212N\nwith the field total energy, \u03b5 = H = n=1 Hnn + n6=m Hnm . The energy of the cross-correlating unit-fields is\nthen satisfy the inequality 0 \u2264 H \u2264 N 2 \u03b501 with the respective effective number 0 \u2264 N \u2264 N 2 of the unit-fields\n(particles), where \u03b501 = (k201 + m201 )1/2 . It is clear now that the relations (373) and (374), which have been derived\nin Part I for the relativistic [\u03b50n = (k20n + m20n )1/2 ] unit-fields by using the traditional quantum field theory, are valid\nonly for the non-relativistic [\u03b50n \u2248 (k20n /2m0n ) + m0n ] unit-fields. The relativistic unit-fields (particles) should obey\nthe relativistic relations (363) and (364), which are completely different from the non-relativistic relations (373) and\n(374). That also means that the total energy \u03b5 of the composite field (particle) composed from the N relativistic or\nnon-relativistic unit-fields (elementary particles) does not overcome the relativistic limit:\n\u03b5 \u2264 N (k201 + m201 )1/2 .\n\n(379)\n\nIt can be mentioned again that the above-presented relativistic equations based on the relativistic energy \u03b50n =\n(k20n + m20n )1/2 are considerably simplified in the case of the mass-less (m0n = 0) unit-fields associated with the\nmass-less (m0n = 0) particles. While the non-relativistic equations based on the non-relativistic approximation\n\u03b50n \u2248 (k20n /2m0n ) + m0n do not have any physical meaning for the mass-less unit-fields (particles).\n\n\f94\n3. The physical interpretation of the effective number of the unit-fields (particles): The normal and virtual unit-fields\n(elementary particles)\nThe physical interpretation of the effective number N = \u03b5/\u03b501 of the N interference-less unit-fields (particles) is\nvery simple:\nN = N.\n\n(380)\n\nThe physical meaning of the effective number N of the N interfering (cross-correlating) unit-fields is more complicated.\nFor the sake of simplicity let me first interpret the number of particles in the case of the composite field (particle)\ncomposed from the two interfering (interacting) unit-fields. The energy-mass relation for the composite relativistic\nfield is given by Eqs. (271), (304) and (325) as\n\u03b52 = \u03b5201 + \u03b5202 + E12 + E21 ,\n\n(381)\n\nwhere the cross-correlation terms E12 and E21 are determined by the relativistic equations (274), (275), (294), (295),\n(307), (308), (328) and (329). For the composite non-relativistic field, the energy-mass relation is given by Eqs. (282),\n(315) and (335) as\n\u03b5 = \u03b501 + \u03b502 + \u03b512 + \u03b521 ,\n\n(382)\n\nwhere the non-relativistic cross-correlation (interaction) energies \u03b512 and \u03b521 are determined by the non-relativistic\nequations (286), (287), (300), (301), (319), (320), (339) and (340). According to the Einstein special relativity\nthe energies \u03b501 and \u03b502 in the non-relativistic relation (382) could be attributed to the physical substance of the\n1st and 2nd non-relativistic unit-fields (elementary particles). Correspondingly, the energies \u03b521 and \u03b521 could be\nattributed, at least formally, to the physical matter (mass-energy) of the 3rd and 4th non-relativistic unit-fields\n(particles) of interaction. The 3rd and 4th non-relativistic unit-fields (particles) of interaction, which are attributed\nto the interaction of the 1st and 2nd non-relativistic unit-fields (elementary particles), could be interpreted as the\ncarriers of the non-relativistic interaction (force). The 3rd and 4th unit-fields (particles) of interaction are the virtual\nunit-fields (particles) because they are created and exist only in the exchange (interaction) process. In other words,\nthe interaction between the 1st and 2nd interacting (interfering) normal unit-fields (particles) could be considered as\nbeing caused (mediated) by the simultaneous emission and absorption (virtual exchange) of the 3rd and 4th virtual\nunit-fields (particles) of interaction. The exchange of 3rd and 4th virtual unit-fields (particles) of interaction does\ntransport momentum and energy between the 1st and 2nd normal unit-fields (elementary particles), thereby changing\ntheir momentum and energy. The interaction results into the attraction or repelling of the 1st and 2nd non-relativistic\ninteracting elementary unit-fields (particles) characterizing by the interactive force that has the absolute value and\ndirection. The interaction may be interpreted also in the frame of the perturbation approximation of the traditional\nquantum field theory as follows. From a point of view of the energy, a point-like elementary particle and the unit-wave\nassociated with this particle are equivalent (indistinguishable) objects (Sec. 3). Therefore the 1st and 2nd elementary\npoint-particles separated by the vacuum attract or repel each other by the force mediating by the virtual exchange of\nthe 3rd and 4th virtual point-particles of interaction through the vacuum. The interpretation of the relativistic relation\n(381) is quite similar to the above-considered non-relativistic equation (382). The energies squared \u03b5201 and \u03b5202 could\nbe attributed to the physical substance (mass-energy) of the 1st and 2nd relativistic normal unit-fields (elementary\nparticles). The cross-correlation terms E12 and E21 could be attributed to the physical substance of the 3st and 4th\nrelativistic virtual unit-fields (particles) of the relativistic interaction. Thus the relativistic interaction between the\ntwo normal, relativistic unit-fields (elementary particles) could be considered (interpreted) as the interplay of the four\nunit-fields (particles), where the composite field (particle) is composed from the 1st and 2nd normal, relativistic unitfields (elementary particles) and the 3rd and 4th virtual, relativistic unit-fields (elementary particles). The effective\nnumber N of the interacting unit-fields (particles) in the interval (366) or (376) has been obtained by comparison of\nthe total energy \u03b5 of the composite field (particle) with the energies \u03b501 and \u03b502 of the 1st and 2nd identical (\u03b501 = \u03b502 )\nnormal unit-fields (elementary particles): N = \u03b5/\u03b501 in the interval 0 \u2264 N \u2264 N or 0 \u2264 N \u2264 N 2 for N = 2. Although\nthe effective number N of the interfering unit-fields (interacting particles) is different from the number (four) of the\ninterplaying unit-fields (particles), the two interpretations describe the same physical process, namely the interference\n(interaction) of the two (N = 2) elementary particles. One can easily extend the above-presented analysis to the\nmulti-particle (N > 2) system. In such a case, the each pair of the normal unit-fields (elementary particles) is\nassociated with the pair of virtual unit-fields (elementary particles), while the effective number N of the interacting\nunit-fields (particles) is given by N = \u03b5/\u03b501 in the interval 0 \u2264 N \u2264 N or 0 \u2264 N \u2264 N 2 for N > 2.\n\n\f95\n4. The energy conservation and the non-conservation of mass and number of the normal and virtual unit-fields\n(elementary particles): Annihilation of unit-fields (elementary particles)\nFor the two normal interfering unit-fields (interacting elementary particles), the energy conservation law applied to\nEqs. (381) and (382) is given respectively by the relations\n\u03b5201 (t) + \u03b5202 (t) + E12 (t) + E21 (t) = \u03b5201 (t\u2032 ) + \u03b5202 (t\u2032 ) + E12 (t\u2032 ) + E21 (t\u2032 )\n\n(383)\n\n\u03b501 (t) + \u03b502 (t) + \u03b512 (t) + \u03b521 (t) = \u03b501 (t\u2032 ) + \u03b502 (t\u2032 ) + \u03b512 (t\u2032 ) + \u03b521 (t\u2032 )\n\n(384)\n\nand\n\nfor the relativistic and non-relativistic unit-fields (particles). Here, the left- and right-hand sides of Eq. (383)\nare the squares of total energies of the interfering relativistic unit-fields (particles) at the time moments t and t\u2032 ,\nrespectively. While, the left- and right-hand sides of Eq. (384) describe the total energies of the interfering nonrelativistic unit-fields at the time moments t and t\u2032 , respectively. From the point of view of the energy, Eqs. (383)\nand (384) describe the interplay of the four unit-fields (particles), namely the 1st and 2nd normal, massive unit-fields\n(elementary particles) and 3rd and 4th virtual, mass-less unit-fields (elementary particles). The relativistic equation\n(383) describes the energy conservation of the four unit-fields (particles) associated with the massive and/or mass-less\nunit-fields (particles). For an example, the left-hand side of Eq. (383) may be associated with the massive and\nmass-less unit-fields (particles). The right-hand side of Eq. (383) may contain the mass-less unit-fields (particles),\nonly. In such a case, the rest-mass of the 1st and 2nd normal unit-fields (elementary particles) does annihilate and\nthen convert into the energy of the mass-less particles. If the left-side of Eq. (383) does include only the mass-less\nunit-fields (particles), then the energy of the mass-less particles converts into the mass-energy of the massive and massless unit-fields (particles). It should be stressed that the non-relativistic equation (384) based on the non-relativistic\napproximation \u03b50n \u2248 (k20n /2m0n ) + m0n does not have any physical sense for the mass-less unit-fields (particles). In\nthe case of E12 (t\u2032 ) = E21 (t\u2032 ) = 0 or \u03b512 (t\u2032 ) = \u03b521 (t\u2032 ) = 0, the 3rd and 4th virtual unit-fields (elementary particles)\ndisappear:\n\u03b5201 (t) + \u03b5202 (t) + E12 (t) + E21 (t) = \u03b5201 (t\u2032 ) + \u03b5202 (t\u2032 )\n\n(385)\n\n\u03b501 (t) + \u03b502 (t) + \u03b512 (t) + \u03b521 (t) = \u03b501 (t\u2032 ) + \u03b502 (t\u2032 ).\n\n(386)\n\nand\n\nThat is to say that the 3rd and 4th virtual unit-fields (particles) do annihilate and the respective virtual energies\nand masses convert into the normal energies and masses of the 1st and 2nd normal unit-fields (particles). The crosscorrelation terms [E12 (t\u2032 ) and E21 (t\u2032 )] and the cross-correlation energies [\u03b512 (t\u2032 ) and \u03b521 (t\u2032 )] do vanish in the two typical\ncomposite systems. The first system corresponds to the 1st and 2nd unit-fields, which are orthogonal in the Hilbert\nspace. Such unit-fields correspond to the eigensolutions of the equations of motion of the composite system. In the\nsecond system, the 1st and 2nd unit-fields (particles) are separated by the infinite distance. The above-presented\nanalysis can be easily extended to the multi-particle (N > 2) system. In such a case, the each pair of the normal\nunit-fields (elementary particles) is associated with the pair of virtual unit-fields (elementary particles).\n5. Global (N \u2192 \u221e) Composite Field associated with the Universe of Einstein's elementary particles\nIn the above-presented conceptual picture of the unit-fields (elementary particles) combining the basic physical\nconceptions of canonical quantum mechanics with the special relativity, the Global Composite Field composed from\nthe unit-fields associated with the all (N \u2192 \u221e) elementary particles satisfying the Einstein special relativity could\nbe considered as the Global Composite Field of the Einstein Universe. In such a picture, the Global Composite Field\n\u03a8(r, t) =\n\nNX\n\u2192\u221e\n\n\u03c80n (r, t)\n\n(387)\n\nn=1\n\nattributed to the Global Composite Particle is composed from the interfering or non-interfering material unit-fields\nassociated with the material elementary particles of the Einstein special relativity. The elementary particle of the\nGlobal Composite Field is associated with the \"field quanta\" (unit-field). The unit-field (quanta of energy-mass) of\nthe Global Composite Field is assumed not to be made up of smaller unit-fields (elementary particles).\n\n\f96\nLet me indicate the formal and conceptual differences between the formulation of the Global Quantum (Composite)\nField (387) and the modeling of the Fundamental Non-Quantum Fields and the Fundamental Quantum Fields of\nOperators associated with the fundamental (electromagnetic, weak and strong) interactions of the traditional quantum\nfield theories and SM. The present model follows the scheme [a unit-field (particle) \u2192 Global Quantum (Composite)\nField ], while the traditional quantum field theories and SM follow the inverse approach [Global Non-Quantum Field\n\u2192 a particle]. That means the present model regards individual particles (unit-fields) as fundamental objects, while\nthe field theories and SM assume that only the Global field is fundamental. In other words, the present model of the\nGlobal Quantum Field \u03a8(r, t) of the Einstein Universe does begin the field description with determination of a \"field\nquanta\", namely formulation of a single unit-field \u03c80n (r, t) and its equation of motion by using the generalization\nof the Einstein energy-mass relation. That is different from the canonical approach (formulation) of traditional\nquantum field theories and SM, which first look for the Global, Fundamental, Non-Quantum Field and its Lagrangian\n(Hamiltonian) by postulating a set of symmetries of the Field Lagrangian (Hamiltonian) and then construct the\nFundamental Quantum Field of Operators determining the fundamental elementary particle (\"field quanta\"). Indeed,\nin the traditional quantum field theories and SM, the fundamental elementary particles of the Fundamental NonQuantum Fields \u03a8i (r, t) associated with the three fundamental [electromagnetic (i = 1), weak (i = 2) and strong\n(i = 3)] interactions are found by using the Dirac second quantization procedure based on the formal replacement\nof the Fundamental Non-Quantum Field \u03a8i (r, t) by the Operator of Fundamental Field \u03a8\u0302i (r, t) composed from the\ncreation (\u00e2\u2020i,0n ) and destruction (\u00e2i,0n ) operators of the respective (i-th) fundamental elementary particles. The present\nmodel deals with the one unified field [Global Quantum Field \u03a8(r, t)] composed from the unit-fields (particles), while\nthe traditional quantum field theories and SM consider the six fundamental fields, namely the three Fundamental\nNon-quantum Fields \u03a8i (r, t) and the three Fundamental Quantum Fields of Operators \u03a8\u0302i (r, t). Here, one should not\nconfuse the Global Quantum Field (387) of the present model, which is not a field of operators, with the Fundamental\nQuantum Field of Operators of the traditional quantum field theories and SM.\nThe conceptual difference between the approach (formulation) of the present model and the traditional quantum\nfield theories and SM could be illustrated by the following concrete example. Formally, Eqs. (190) and (227) look\nlike the Klein-Gordon-Fock equation of the relativistic quantum field theory and SM. However, in contrast to the\nKlein-Gordon-Fock equation describing the Infinite Non-quantum Field \u03a8SB (r, t) of Particles (Scalar Bosons), Eqs.\n(190) and (227) are formulated and interpreted in the present model as the single-particle relativistic equation for\nthe unit-fields \u03c80n (r, t) of the Global Composite Field (387), which is similar to the Schr\u00f6dinger equation for the\nde Broglie wave of the physical matter associated with a non-relativistic particle. In the traditional quantum field\ntheories and SM, the Infinite Non-quantum Fields \u03a8SB (r, t) and \u03a8\u2217SB (r, t) placed into the Infinite (V \u2192 \u221e) Resonator\nof Universe, are given by the Fourier discrete (modal) decompositions that satisfies the Klein-Gordon-Fock equation\nof motion with the boundary conditions of the Universe Resonator:\n\u03a8SB =\n\nNX\n\u2192\u221e\n\n(2V \u03b5kn )\u22121/2 (akn e\u2212ikn r + bkn eikn r )\n\n(388)\n\n(2V \u03b5kn )\u22121/2 (akn eikn r + bkn e\u2212ikn r ),\n\n(389)\n\nn=1\n\nand\n\u03a8\u2217SB\n\n=\n\nNX\n\u2192\u221e\nn=1\n\nwhere \u03b5kn = \u03c9kn = (kn 2 + m2 )1/2 is the Planck-Einstein energy of the n-th boson, which has the discrete (quantum)\nwave-number (243) and frequency (244) with n = m = l due to the quantization imposed by the boundary conditions.\nNotice, the different resonator modes associated with the different particles are orthogonal in the Hilbert space,\nproviding the interference-less and interaction-less behavior of the different modes and particles. In other words, the\nInfinite Non-quantum Fields \u03a8SB (r, t) and \u03a8\u2217SB (r, t), in fact, are the Infinite Quantum Fields, with the \"hidden\"\nquantization provided by the use of the Universe Resonator. The second quantization of the fields (388) and (389)\nyields the Infinite Quantum Fields of Operators (Infinite Quantum Field-Operators):\n\u03a8\u0302SB =\n\nNX\n\u2192\u221e\n\n(2V \u03b5kn )\u22121/2 (\u00e2kn e\u2212ikn r + b\u0302\u2020kn eikn r )\n\n(390)\n\n(2V \u03b5kn )\u22121/2 (\u00e2\u2020kn eikn r + b\u0302kn e\u2212ikn r ).\n\n(391)\n\nn=1\n\nand\n\u03a8\u0302\u2020SB =\n\nNX\n\u2192\u221e\nn=1\n\n\f97\nThe operators \u00e2\u2020kn , \u00e2kn , b\u0302\u2020kn , and b\u0302kn are respectively the creation and destruction operators for the n-th particle\n(boson) and the n-th antiparticle (antiboson) inside the Resonator of Universe. The interference-less and interactionless behavior of the resonator-mode operators associated with the particles is provided by the canonical commutation\nrelations [\u00e2kn , \u00e2\u2020km ] = [b\u0302kn , b\u0302\u2020km ] = \u03b4nm for the bosons and antibosons (the other operator pairs commute). Here, \u03b4nm\nis the Kronecker symbol. The details and interpretations of the Infinite Non-quantum Fields (388) and (389) and\nthe Infinite Quantum Fields of Operators (390) and (391) have been presented in Sec. 2.1.2. of Part I. Although the\nGlobal Quantum Field (387) of the present model is somewhat similar to the Infinite Non-quantum Fields (388) and\n(389) and the Infinite Quantum Fields of Operators (390) and (391) of the traditional quantum field theories and\nSM, the Global Quantum Field is not a Field of Operators and its quantization does not require the resonator-like\nboundaries of Universe. Furthermore, the Global Quantum Field (387) describes both the interacting (interfering) and\nnon-interacting (interference-free) unit-fields associated with the elementary particles of the Einstein special relativity,\nwhile the Infinite Non-quantum Fields (388) and (389) and the Infinite Quantum Fields of Operators (390) and (391)\ndeal with the interaction-free particles of the very particular kind (scalar bosons).\n5. SUBSTRUCTURES OF A UNIT-FIELD ASSOCIATED WITH FUNDAMENTAL (GRAVITATIONAL,\nELECTROMAGNETIC, WEAK AND STRONG) FIELDS: THE GENERATOR AND ASSOCIATE\nCOMPONENTS OF THE UNIT-FIELD\n\nEquations (183) - (387) do not indicate the dependence of the single unit-field \u03c80n and its energy \u03b50n on the\nintrinsic angular-momentum (spin) and charge of the unit-filed (particle). Indeed, the unit-field \u03c80n is determined\nas the solution of the equation of motion (190) or (227) with the initial and boundary conditions imposed, which do\nnot contain the spin and charge of the particle. That is to say that the unit-field \u03c80n depends solely on the particle\nrest-mass m0 , which could be considered as the particular initial conditions of Eqs. (190) and (227). In Eqs. (183)\n- (387), one could distinguish the massive (m0n 6= 0) and mass-less (m0n = 0) unit-fields \u03c80n . The unit-fields \u03c80n\ncorresponding to the solutions of Eq. (190) or (227) with the rest masses m0n 6= 0 could be considered as the massive\nunit-fields associated with the massive particles. The unit-fields \u03c80n determining by the equations (197) and (228)\ncorrespond to the mass-less unit-fields ( particles). The different configurations of a unit-field \u03c80n corresponding to the\ndifferent solutions of Eq. (190) or (227) for the given rest-mass m0n of the n-th particle are attributed to the different\nmomentums k0n of the particle. In such a case, the model describes the interfering (interacting) and non-interfering\n(non-interacting) unit-fields \u03c80n of Global Composite Field (387) attributed to the elementary particles satisfying\nEinstein's special relativity in the general form, which does not indicate the kind (type) of the unit-field (elementary\nparticle). The description could be considered as the unified model of the unified unit-fields (particles). In the unified\nmodel [Eqs. (183) - (387)], a unified unit-field \u03c80n does associate with the n-th unified point-particle of Einstein's\nspecial relativity that does not has a substructure. In other words, the unified unit-field \u03c80n is considered as the\n4-dimensional structure-less object in the spacetime, namely as a structure-less quanta of energy-mass of the Global\nUnified Field (387). Naturally, the appropriate substructure (internal structure) of the unit-field \u03c80n associated with\nthe respective kind of an elementary particle of the Universe could determine the four fundamental (gravitational,\nelectromagnetic, weak and strong) interactions, forces and energies of the Nature.\nThe appropriate structuring of the unit-field \u03c80n is not a very simple problem. The internal substructure of the unitfield \u03c80n should determine the kind of the elementary particle and its energy in agreement with the four fundamental\n(gravitational, electromagnetic, weak and strong) interactions, forces and energies associated with the rest masses,\nintrinsic angular momentums (spins) and charges of the respective kinds of elementary particles. An analysis shows\nthat the unit-field \u03c80n should be separated (divided) into the substructures as follows. The structuring of the unified\nunit-field \u03c80n could be presented in general form as the indivisible connection of the unit-field generator \u03c8\u03030n with the\ngravitational (\u03c6Gn ), electric (\u03c6En ), weak (\u03c6W n ) and strong (\u03c6Sn ) associate-components (ACs) of the unit-field:\n\u03c80n = \u03c8\u03030n (\u03c6Gn + \u03c6En + \u03c6W n + \u03c6Sn ) = \u03c8\u03030n\n\n4\nX\n\n\u03c6In .\n\n(392)\n\nI=1\n\nThe four unit-field components \u03c8\u03030n \u03c6In are attributed to the four fundamental [gravitational (I=1), electromagnetic\n(I=2), weak (I=3) and strong (I=4)] fields characterized by the respective masses, charges and spins. In the case of\nP4\nI=1 \u03c6In = 1, the structure-less unified unit-field \u03c80n attributed to the n-th unified elementary particle is indistinguishable from the unit-field generator \u03c8\u03030n (for comparison, see the relevant examples in Part I of the present study). If\nthe generator \u03c8\u03030n of the unit-field component \u03c8\u03030n \u03c6In vanishes, then the unit-field component disappear (\u03c8\u03030n \u03c6In = 0).\nP4\nThat means that the associate-component \u03c6In of the unit-field structure \u03c8\u03030n I=1 \u03c6In is the secondary object, which\n\n\f98\nis indivisibly connected with the unit-field generator \u03c8\u03030n . The use of the structured unit-field (392) instead of the\nstructure-less unified unit-field \u03c80n yields the four-component version of the unified model [Eqs. (183) - (387)]. If\nthe unit-field associating with an elementary particle does not obey some fundamental interaction properties due to\nthe absence of some associate-components attributed to the rest mass, charge or spin, then the unit-field structure\nsimplifies to the one-, two- or three-component unit-field. The use of the one-, two-, three- or four-component unitfield instead of the structure-less unified unit-field naturally yields the one-, two-, three or four-component version\n(sub-model) of the unified model [Eqs. (183) - (387)]. The associate-components \u03c6In may be interpreted as the four\n\"dressings\" of the unit-field generator \u03c8\u03030n . In such a picture, the unit-field generator \u03c8\u03030n is a \"carrier\" of these\n\"dressings\" characterizing by the respective masses, charges and spins, which are responsible for the four fundamental\n(gravitational, electromagnetic, weak and strong) fields and interactions.\nAlthough the unit-field representation (392) could be somewhat strange for the non-experts in the quantum fields\nand SM, the representation reflects just a fact that the gravitational, electromagnetic, weak and strong fields satisfy\nthe superposition principle. Notice, the alternative representation \u03c80n = \u03c8\u03030n (\u03c6Gn \u03c6En \u03c6W n \u03c6Sn ) of the unit-field \u03c80n\nresults into incorrect vanishing of the unit-field in the region of the spacetime, where one of the associate-components\ndoes vanish, while other ACs do not. The gravitational, electromagnetic, weak and strong fields have different physical\nnatures. In order to separate the physical natures of the unit-field associate-components (ACs) from each other, any\nmathematical product of the cross-correlation between the associate components of the different natures is assumed\nto be equal to zero. In other words, one should suppose that the associate components \u03c6In and \u03c6Jn should satisfy\nthe orthogonality-like gauge (restriction):\n\u03c6In \u03c6Jn = \u03c6In \u03c6Jn \u03b4IJ ,\n\n(393)\n\nwhere \u03b4IJ is the Kronecker delta. Respectively, the values like \u2207\u03c6In \u2207\u03c6Jn and \u03c6\u0307In \u03c6\u0307Jn should be also vanished\n(\u2207\u03c6In \u2207\u03c6Jn = \u2207\u03c6In \u2207\u03c6Jn \u03b4IJ and \u03c6\u0307In \u03c6\u0307Jn = \u03c6\u0307In \u03c6\u0307Jn \u03b4IJ ) for I 6= J. The orthogonality-like gauge (393), which could\nbe mathematically interpreted as the orthogonality of the associate-components in the Hilbert (mathematical) space,\nwill be used in the following sections to exclude the cross-correlation (interference) between the associate components\nof different physical natures in the physical spacetime. Mathematically, the orthogonality-like gauge (393) means\nthat the four ACs may be formally represented as the components of the four-vector or the four-component onecolumn (one-row) matrix in the Hilbert space. Such a mathematical representation is relevant, for instance, to the\nmatrix mechanics of Heisenberg, the Pauly and Dirac matrices in quantum physics and the tensor formalism in\nEinstein's relativity, which exclude the cross-correlation (interference) of the different components of the n-vector\nor the n-component one-column (one-row) matrix. Nevertheless, for the sake of mathematical simplicity, instead of\nthe aforementioned mathematical formalisms I will use the representation (392) together with the orthogonality-like\ngauges (restrictions) imposed on the unit-field generator \u03c8\u03030n and the associate-components \u03c6In . In order to satisfy\nthe physical properties of the experimentally observed elementary particles, the unit-field generator and associatecomponents should be calibrated (fixed) by the additional restriction (gauge) conditions, which will be presented in\nthe following sections.\n5.1. The one-component unit-field associated with the gravitational, electromagnetic, weak or strong ACs\n\nThe one-component unit-field (particle) with the pure gravitational, electric, weak or strong associate-component\n(AC) is described by the respective one-component sub-model, which is based on the use of the one-component\nunit-field \u03c80n = \u03c8\u03030n \u03c6In determined by the equation\n\u03c80n = \u03c8\u03030n \u03c6Gn = \u03c8\u03030n \u03c61n ,\n\n(394)\n\n\u03c80n = \u03c8\u03030n \u03c6En = \u03c8\u03030n \u03c62n ,\n\n(395)\n\n\u03c80n = \u03c8\u03030n \u03c6W n = \u03c8\u03030n \u03c63n ,\n\n(396)\n\n\u03c80n = \u03c8\u03030n \u03c6Sn = \u03c8\u03030n \u03c64n ,\n\n(397)\n\nor\n\nwhich is associated respectively with the pure gravitation, electromagnetism, weak interaction or strong interaction.\nNaturally, the unit-fields (394) - (397) are described by the unified model [Eqs. (183) - (387)], in which the structureless unified unit-field \u03c80n is replaced by the one-component structured unit-field \u03c80n = \u03c8\u03030n \u03c6In , where I = 1, 2 3 or 4.\n\n\f99\nThe new equations for the unit-fields (394) - (397) would be distinguished from each other only by the index I. That\nis to say that the mathematical background of description of the one-component unit-fields is completely unified. The\ndifferent physical properties of the pure gravitational (I=1), electromagnetic (I=2), weak (I=3) and strong (I=4)\nunit-fields (particles) are attributed to the different properties of the gravitational (\u03c61n ), electromagnetic (\u03c62n ), weak\n(\u03c63n ) and strong (\u03c64n ) associate-components of the unit-field. Therefore the gravitational, electric, weak and strong\nassociate-components (ACs) of the unit-field should be considered as the mediators of the respective interactions and\nforces, while the unit-field generator \u03c8\u03030n should be interpreted as a \"carrier\" of these ACs. It is not necessary to\npresent the all new equations corresponding to Eqs. (183) - (387). Let me show only the equations, which determine\nthe most basic physical properties of the pure gravitational, electromagnetic, weak or strong fields, particles and\ninteractions.\n5.1.1. The energy-mass relation and equation of motion for the single one-component unit-field with the pure gravitational,\nelectromagnetic, weak or strong AC: The one-component unit-field gauges\n\n1. The model 1st-version based on the straightforward generalization of the Einstein energy-mass relation for the\nsingle one-component unit-field by using the 2nd derivatives\nThe generalized energy-mass relation for the n-th one-component relativistic unit-field [(394) - (397)] is given by\nEq. (185) as\nZ\n\u0010\n\u0011\n1\n2\n\u2217\n\u03b50n =\n\u03c80n\n\u2212\u03c8\u03080n \u2212 \u22072 \u03c80n + m20n \u03c80n d3 x,\n(398)\n2 V\nwhere \u03c80n = \u03c8\u03030n \u03c6In .

In order to select the solutions satisfying only the\nexperimentally observed properties of the elementary particles, the field generator \u03c8\u03030n and the associate-component\n\u03c6In should be calibrated (fixed) by the additional restriction (gauge) conditions. Such a procedure is similar to the\nprocedure of fixing (choosing) a field gauge in the traditional field theories. An analysis of the consequences that\nfollow from the use of different calibrations (gauges) of the unit-field generator \u03c8\u03030n and the associate-component \u03c6In\nsuggests the following two gauges. The first calibration (static gauge)\n\u03c6\u0307In = 0\n\n(401)\n\nmeans that the associate-component \u03c6In is static one. The second restriction (gauge)\n\u03c8\u0303 \u0307 0n \u03c6\u0307In \u2212 \u2207\u03c8\u03030n \u2207\u03c6In = 0\n\n(402)\n\nshould be attributed to the orthogonality of the gradients \u2207\u03c8\u03030n and \u2207\u03c6In in the Hilbert (mathematical) space, which\nmeans that the gradients \u2207\u03c8\u03030n and \u2207\u03c6In do not cross-correlate (interfere) in the physical spacetime. The procedure\nof fixing the gauges (401) and (402) in Eq. (400) yields the simpler equation of motion\n\u03c6In (\u0003\u03c8\u03030n + m20 \u03c8\u03030n ) + \u03c8\u03030n \u22072 \u03c6In = 0.\n\n(403)\n\nIn addition to the gauges (401) and (402), one may use the Laplace gauge\n\u22072 \u03c6In = 0\n\n(404)\n\n\f100\nor the Helmholtz (eigen) gauge\n\u22072 \u03c6In + \u03932In \u03c6In = 0\n\n(405)\n\nimposed on the associate-component \u03c6In by the Laplace (404) or Helmholtz (405) equation. The equation (403) with\nthe gauge (404) or (405) imposed on the unit-field AC yields the respective equation for the unit-field generator \u03c8\u03030n :\n\u0003\u03c8\u03030n + m20 \u03c8\u03030n = 0\n\n(406)\n\n\u0003\u03c8\u03030n + (m20 + \u03932In )\u03c8\u03030n = 0.\n\n(407)\n\nIn Eqs. (405) and (407), which depend on the eigen parameter \u03932In , the value \u0393In can be the real (\u0393In = |\u0393In |)\nor imaginary (\u0393In = i|\u0393In |) value. The equation (406) describes a unit-field (particle) with the mass m0 , while Eq.\n(407) corresponds to a unit-field (particle) with the mass (m20 + \u03932In )1/2 . Naturally, Eqs. (404) and (406) should\ndescribe the unit-fields (elementary particles) whose physical properties are different from the unit-fields (elementary\nparticles) describing by Eqs. (405) and (407). The unit-fields (particles) with the different physical properties could\nbe considered as the unit-fields (particles) of different kinds. Notice, Eqs. (406) and (407) are coupled to the associatecomponent \u03c60I , whose configuration is determining respectively by Eq. (404) or (405), only through the orthogonality\ncondition (402). If the eigen-parameter \u03932In = 0, then Eqs. (404) and (405) are indistinguishable from each other.\nIn such a case, the equations (406) and (407) are equivalent. In other words, they describe the same unit-field with\nthe particle mass m0 . That means Eqs. (404) and (406) are the particular cases of the general equations (405) and\n(407). In addition, one should describe properties of the mass-less unit-fields (particles), which have the zero rest-mass\n(m0 = 0) with the respective energy-mass relation \u03b520n = k20n . The mass-less, one-component unit-fields (particles)\nare described simply by Eq. (400) with the rest mass m0 = 0, which has the form \u03c6In \u0003\u03c8\u03030n + \u03c8\u03030n \u0003\u03c6In = 0.\nThe unit-fields that satisfy this equation have the structure-less form (235) of the the time-harmonic plane waves\n\u221a\n\u03c80n (r, t) = \u03c8\u03030n (r, t)\u03c6In (r, t) = a0n ei(k0n r\u2212\u03b50n t) with the generator \u03c8\u03030n (r, t) = a0n ei([k0n /2]r\u2212[\u03b50n /2]t) and associate\u221a\ncomponent \u03c6In (r, t) = a0n ei([k0n /2]r\u2212[\u03b50n /2]t) that are indistinguishable from each other. In contrast to the massive\nunit-fields (particles), which obey the time-independent ACs (\u03c6\u0307In = 0), the mass-less unit-fields particles have the\ntime-dependent ACs (\u03c6\u0307In 6= 0). In such a case the gauge (402) provides the balance between the temporal and spatial\nP\nvariations of the unit-field. Notice, in the case of 4I=1 \u03c6In = 1, the structure-less unified unit-field \u03c80n attributed\nto the n-th unified elementary particle is indistinguishable from the unit-field generator \u03c8\u03030n (for comparison, see Eq.\n(392) and the relevant examples in Sec. I of the present study).\nThe use of the gauges (401) and (402) in the general equation (398) yields the unit-field energy squared as\nZ\ni\nh\n1\n \u0308 \u2212 \u22072 \u03c8\u0303 + m2 \u03c8\u0303 + \u03c8\u0303 (\u03c6 )\u22121 \u22072 \u03c6\n3\n2\n\u2217\n(408)\n\u03b50n =\n\u03c8\u03030n\n\u03c6In \u2217 \u2212\u03c8\u0303\n0n In\nIn \u03c6In d x,\n0n\n0 0n\n0n\n2 V\nwhere the unit-field generator \u03c8\u03030n is a solution of Eq. (406) or (407), while the unit-field associate-component \u03c6In is\na solution of Eq. (404) or (405), respectively. The well-known stationary solutions of Eqs. (406) and (407) are given\nby the time-harmonic plane waves\n\u03c8\u03030n (r, t) = a0n ei(k0n r\u2212\u03b50n t+\u03b1n )\n\n(409)\n\nof the form (235) with the phase \u03b1n 6= 0. Such solutions are also called the plane waves or the de Broglie waves. In the\ncase of the unit-field with the generator (409) and the associate-component \u03c6In calibrated by the Laplace equation\n(404), the unit-field energy squared is given by the (408) as\nZ\n\u0003\n1\u0002 2\n2\n2\n2\n\u2217\n\u03b50n =\n\u03b5 + (k0n + m0 )\n\u03c8\u03030n\n\u03c8\u03030n \u03c6\u2217In \u03c6In d3 x =\n2 0n\nV\nZ\n\u2217\n= (k20n + m20 )\n\u03c8\u03030n\n\u03c8\u03030n \u03c6\u2217In \u03c6In d3 x,\n(410)\nV\n\n\u03b520n\n\nwhere the value\ndoes not depend on the unit-field generator phase \u03b1n . The square of energy (410) of the onecomponent unit-field is consistent with the Einstein energy-mass relations \u03b520 = k20 + m20 and \u03b520 = k20 for the massive\nand mass-less particles of the Einstein special relativity under the normalization (200), which here is given by the\n\n\f101\nR\nR\n\u2217\n\u03c8\u03030n \u03c6\u2217In \u03c6In d3 x = a20n V \u03c6\u2217In \u03c6In d3 x = 1. For the unit-field with the generator (409) and the associaterelation V \u03c8\u03030n\ncomponent \u03c6In calibrated by the Helmholtz equation (405), the unit-field energy squared is given by the (408) as\nZ\n\u0003\n1\u0002 2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n\u2217\n\u03b50n =\n\u03b5 + (k0n + (m0 + \u0393In ))\n\u03c8\u03030n\n\u03c8\u03030n \u03c6\u2217In \u03c6In d3 x =\n2 0n\nV\nZ\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u2217\n\u03c8\u03030n \u03c6\u2217In \u03c6In d3 x,\n(411)\n\u03c8\u03030n\n= k20n + (m20 + \u03932In )\nV\n\nwhich is in agreement with the Einstein energy-mass relation \u03b520 = k20n + (m20 + \u03932In ) for a particle of the mass\n(m20 + \u03932In )1/2 under the above-mentioned normalization (200). The additional (gauge) mass \u0393In could be attributed\nto the mass of AC of the unit-field (particle). In the case of the AC calibrated by the gauge (405) with \u0393In = 0, the\ngauge mass \u0393In of the AC is equal to zero. Since the value \u03b520n \u2265 0, the unit-fields\n(particles) with\u0003 the parameters\n\u0002\n\u0393In = i|\u0393In | under the condition |\u0393In | \u2265 m0 could exist only as the moving ( k20n + (m20 \u2212 |\u0393In |2 ) > 0) unit-fields\n(particles).\nIn the case of a non-relativistic unit-field [(394) - (397)] calibrated by Eqs. (401) and (402) with the generator (409)\nand the associate-component \u03c6In calibrated by the Laplace equation (404), the non-relativistic energy-mass relation\n(192) yields the equation\n\u0013\u0015 Z\n\u0014\n\u0012 2\nk0n\n1\n\u2217\n\u03c8\u03030n \u03c6\u2217In \u03c6In d3 x =\n\u03c8\u03030n\n\u03b50n +\n+ m0\n\u03b50n =\n2\n2m0\nV\n\u0012 2\n\u0013Z\nk0n\n\u2217\n=\n\u03c8\u03030n \u03c6\u2217In \u03c6In d3 x,\n(412)\n\u03c8\u03030n\n+ m0\n2m0\nV\nk2\n\n0n\nwhich is consistent with the Einstein energy-mass relation \u03b50 = 2m\n+ m0 for a non-relativistic (Newton) particle\n0\nunder the normalization (200).

The gravitational (I = 1), electric (I = 2), weak (I = 3) and strong (I = 4) associate-components\n(ACs) \u03c6In have the common unit-field generator \u03c8\u03030n . If the unit-field generator \u03c8\u03030n vanishes, then the all components\n\u03c8\u03030n \u03c6In of the unit-field \u03c80n disappear. That is to say that the unit-field \u03c80n is annihilated by vanishing the unit-field\ngenerator \u03c8\u03030n . The zero total associate-component (\u03a6an = 0) of the unit-field also annihilates the unit-field (particle).\n\n\f106\n5.2.1. The energy-mass relations and equations of motions for the single unit-fields with one-, two-, three- and\nfour-component ACs: The multi-component unit-field gauges\n\nSection (5.1) has presented the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th versions of the energy-mass relations and equations of motions\nfor the single, one-component, structured unit-field. Section (5.2) generalizes the results of Sec. (5.1) for the two-,\nthree- and four-component unit-fields. Notice, the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th versions of Sec. 3 describing the structure-less\n(unified) unit-field and the all four versions 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th versions of Sec. (5.1) dealing with the structured\nunit-field are considered to be equivalent ones, Sec. (5.1) yielded the energy-mass relations that require the different\ngauges [(430), (431) and (433) or (430), (431) and (436)] in order to satisfy the Einstein energy-mass relation. Since\nthe four versions are considered to be equivalent, I present the generalization for the two-, three- and four-component\nunit-fields by using the 1-st version of the model, only. One can easily rewrite the formulas for the 2nd, 3rd and 4th\nversions of the energy-mass relations and equations of motions.\nLet me now derive the energy-mass relations and equations of motions for the single, multi-component unit-field\n(465) with the total associate-component \u03a6an by using the 1-st version of the unit-field model, which is based on the\nstraightforward generalization of the Einstein energy-mass relation for the multi-component unit-field by using the\n2nd derivatives (for the one-component unit-field \u03c80n = \u03c8\u03030n \u03c6In the procedure is given in Sec. 5.1.1). The generalized\nenergy-mass relation for the n-th one-component relativistic unit-field (465) is given by Eq.

Notice, the\nmasses m0n of the same particles are given by m0n = m0 , while the different particles have the different masses\n(m0n 6= m0 ). In order to select the solutions to Eq. (468) that satisfy only the experimentally observed properties of\nthe elementary particles, the field generator \u03c8\u03030n and the total associate-component \u03a6an should be calibrated (fixed)\nby the following gauges. The first calibration (static gauge)\n\u03a6\u0307an = 0\n\n(469)\n\nmeans that the total associate-component (T AC) is static one. The second restriction (gauge)\n \u0307\n\u03c8\u0303 \u03a6\u0307an \u2212 \u2207\u03c8\u03030n \u2207\u03a6an = 0\n\n(470)\n\nshould be attributed to the orthogonality of the gradients \u2207\u03c8\u03030n and \u2207\u03a6an in the Hilbert (mathematical) space, which\nmeans that the gradients \u2207\u03c8\u03030n and \u2207\u03a6an do not cross-correlate (interfere) in the physical spacetime.

Categorization according to the symmetries of the coordinate systems of ACs\n\nIn the model of a structure-less unit-field (elementary particle) describing by Eqs. (183) - (387), the kind of\nthe unit-field (particle) has been determined solely by the particle rest-mass m0 . The structure-less unit-field \u03c80n\ndepends only on the particle rest-mass, which could be considered as the particular initial conditions of the equation\nof motion. In such a case, the different configurations of the structure-less unit-field \u03c80n corresponding to the different\nsolutions of the equation of motion for a given rest-mass m0n are attributed to the different momentums k0n of the\nsame particle. In other words, the structure-less unit-field \u03c80n with the rest mass m0 = 0 or m0 6= 0 is considered\nas the 4-dimensional (in spacetime) structure-less object, namely as the structure-less quanta of energy-mass.

Notice, the Laplace equation does have\nsolutions in the bispherical and toroidal coordinate systems, while the Helmholtz equation does not.\n\nunit-field (particle) with the internal structure (substructure) corresponding to the gravitational, electromagnetic,\nweak and strong fields and interactions has been described by Eqs. (392) - (488). In the model of the structured\nunit-fields (465), the unit-fields \u03c80n = \u03c8\u03030n \u03a6an are distinguished from each other not only by the rest mass m0 , but\nalso by the associate-components \u03c6in of the total associate component \u03a6an . That means that the structured unit-fields\nwith the different ACs correspond to the unit-fields (particles) of the different kinds. It was indicated that the two\ncalibrations (gauges) of the associate-components \u03c6in could be consistent with the Einstein special relativity and\nthe experimentally observed properties of the elementary particles. In order to satisfy these conditions the unit-field\nACs should be calibrated by the gauge (473) in the form of the Laplace (\u03932In = 0) or Helmholt (\u03932In 6= 0) equation.\nThe Laplace and Helmholtz equations (gauges) describe the ACs of the two different kinds, namely the Laplace and\nHelmholtz associate-components with the respective gauge masses \u0393In = 0 and \u0393In 6= 0.\nThe Laplace and Helmholtz equations have the infinite number of possible solutions (configurations). The number\nof the symmetric ACs, which are symmetric in space, however, could be finite due to the finite number of possible\nsymmetries. One of the ways of categorization of the all possible configurations of the ACs, which corresponds to the\ndifferent solutions of the Laplace or Helmholtz equation is the spatial symmetry of the AC. A solution to the Laplace\nor Helmholtz equation is uniquely determined if the value of the function is specified on all boundaries (Dirichlet\nboundary conditions) or if the normal derivative of the function is known on all boundaries (Neumann boundary\nconditions). The Helmholtz equation has solutions in all 11 well-known coordinate systems, namely in Cartesian,\ncircular cylindrical, conical, confocal ellipsoidal, elliptic cylindrical, oblate spheroidal, parabolic, parabolic cylindrical,\nparaboloidal, prolate spheroidal and spherical systems. Naturally, the Helmholtz associate-component \u03c6in can have\nany configuration that corresponds to a solution of the Helmholtz equation in any coordinate system of the 11 systems.\nThe spatial symmetry of the Helmholtz AC could be determined by the symmetry of the coordinate system. Thus the\n11 kinds of the Helmholtz ACs could be categorized by the 11 spatial symmetries of the unit-field associate-components\naccording to the spatial symmetries of the 11 coordinate systems. In addition to the aforementioned 11 coordinate\nsystems and symmetries, the Laplace equation has solutions in the two other coordinate systems, namely in the\nbispherical and toroidal ones. In such a case, the Laplace AC of the unit-field (particle) can have any configuration\nthat corresponds to a solution of the Laplace equation in one of the 13 coordinate systems. The 13 kinds of the\nLaplace AC could be categorized by the spatial symmetry of the Laplace associate-component in the 13 coordinate\nsystems. The all 13 coordinate systems and the respective Laplace and Helmholtz ACs are summarized (categorized)\nin Table I.\nStrictly speaking, the configurations of the Laplace and Helmholtz ACs summarized in Table I are 3-dimensional\nobjects. Nevertheless, in principle, the more exotic (low-dimensional) ACs satisfying the Laplace or Helmholtz equation also can be considered. For instance, the Laplace and Helmholtz ACs having the low-dimensional configurations\n\n\f110\ncould be presented as the 0-D (point), 1-D (straight string), 2-D (open curved string, closed string, open membrane\nor closed membrane) ACs. It should be stressed that the creation of such exotic configurations (points, strings and\nmembranes) from the 3-dimensional Laplace and Helmholtz ACs is practically impossible. Indeed, the low-dimensional\nACs have the Dirac \u03b4-like distributions at least in one of the three spatial dimensions. Therefore the unit-fields with\nthe low-dimensional ACs obey infinite energies [see, Eq. (466)]. Although the low-dimensional ACs obey the infinite\nenergies, in contrast to the 3-dimensional ACs having the finite-energies, they are very important for the simplified\n(0-D, 1-D or 2-D) theoretical analysis of the unit-fields (particles) and for comparison of the present model with the\nmodern string theories.\nIn the modern conceptual picture of the Universe, the all elementary particles have been created in the early stage of\nthe cosmological Big-Bang. The non-elementary particles of the Universe are the products of fusion of the elementary\nparticles in the late stages of the Big-Bang. One may suppose that after creation of the elementary particles they\nsatisfy to the Einstein special relativity. In such a case, the all 13 kinds of the Laplace unit-field ACs and the all 11\nkinds of the Helmholtz unit-field ACs, which do satisfy the generalized Einstein energy-mass relation and respective\nequations of motions, may exist somewhere in the Universe. Although the all 24 kinds of the unit-field ACs may exist\nin principle, the only unit-field ACs that obey physical properties of the experimentally observed elementary particles\nwill be considered in the following sections. One can easily follow the present model for any hypothetical unit-field\nAC of the 24 kinds of the unit-field ACs of the elementary particles that have not been yet observed experimentally.\n5.3.2. The single unit-fields (particles) with the spherical and cylindrical symmetries of the unit-field ACs: Physical\nexplanation of a particle spin\n\nAs an example, consider here the unit-fields (particles) with the spherical and cylindrical symmetries of the Laplace\nand Helmholtz ACs. For the well-known solutions of the Laplace and Helmholtz differential equations in other 11\ncoordinate systems see mathematical textbooks.\n1. The single unit-fields (particles) with the spherical symmetries of the Laplace ACs\nLet me first consider the unit-field (particle) \u03c80n = \u03c8\u03030n \u03a6an whose AC is described by the Laplace equation (calibration). In spherical polar coordinates [r \u2261 (r, \u03b8, \u03c6)], the Laplace (\u03932In = 0) equation (473) for the unit-field\nassociate-component \u03a6an has the form\n#\n\"\n2\n2\n\u2202\nL\u0302\n1\n(489)\nr \u2212 2 \u03a6an (r) = 0,\n\u22072 \u03a6an (r) =\nr \u2202r2\nr\nwhere L\u03022 is the square of the angular momentum operator L\u0302 = i(r \u00d7 \u2207). The two linearly independent well-known\nsolutions to the Laplace equation (489) in a ball centered at the origin, which are non-singular and singular at the\norigin, are called respectively the regular and irregular solid harmonics. The simplest regular and irregular ACs are\ngiven by the regular\n\u03a6an (r) = rl Ylm (\u03b8, \u03c6),\n\n(490)\n\n\u03a6an (r) = r\u2212l\u22121 Ylm (\u03b8, \u03c6)\n\n(491)\n\nand irregular\n\nYlm (\u03b8, \u03c6)\n2\n\nsolid harmonics, where the spherical harmonics\nof degree l and order m are the joint eigenfunctions of the\nsquare of the orbital angular momentum operator L\u0302 and the generator of rotations around the azimuthal axis L\u02c6z :\nL\u03022 Ylm (\u03b8, \u03c6) = l(l + 1)Ylm (\u03b8, \u03c6)\n\n(492)\n\n\u2202\nL\u02c6z Ylm (\u03b8, \u03c6) = \u2212i Ylm (\u03b8, \u03c6) = mYlm (\u03b8, \u03c6).\n\u2202\u03c6\n\n(493)\n\nand\n\nThe ball occupied by the solid harmonic may have the infinite radius (R = \u221e). For a given non-negative integer l,\nthere are 2l + 1 independent solutions of the form (490), one for each integer m with \u2212l \u2264 m \u2264 l.

The harmonic degree l logically to call the orbital quantum number. While the harmonic order m could be\ndenoted as the \"magnetic\" quantum number.\nThe 3-D unit-field (particle) \u03c80n = \u03c8\u03030n \u03a6an is not a point particle of classical mechanics, quantum mechanics or SM.\nTherefore, it obeys naturally the intrinsic (internal) angular momentum (spin) hL\u0302i \u2261 h\u015di associated with the unit-field\nAC. In the case of the unit-field with the unit-field associate-component \u03a6an satisfying Eq. (490) or (491), the square\nof a unit-field spin is given by\nh\u015d2 i = hYlm |\u015d2 |Ylm i = l(l + 1),\n\n(496)\n\nwhile the z-component of the intrinsic orbital angular momentum (spin) is equal to\nhs\u02c6z i = hYlm |s\u02c6z |Ylm i = m.\n\n(497)\n\nThe numbers l and m denote respectively the intrinsic orbital quantum number and the intrinsic \"magnetic\" quantum\nnumber. The unit-fields (particles) with the Laplace ACs and the integer spins describing by Eqs. (492) - (497) could\ncorrespond to the elementary bosons. The present model (see, Sec. 5.2.) does not need the probabilistic normalization\n(494). The regular\n\u03a6an (r) = rl Alm Ylm (\u03b8, \u03c6),\n\n(498)\n\n\u03a6an (r) = r\u2212l\u22121 Alm Ylm (\u03b8, \u03c6)\n\n(499)\n\nand irregular\n\nACs, where Alm is an arbitrary constant, are also the legal solutions of Eq. (489). In the case of Eqs. (498) and\n(499), the square of a unit-field spin is given by\nh\u015d2 i = hAlm Ylm |\u015d2 |Alm Ylm i(hAlm Ylm |Alm Ylm i)\u22121 = l(l + 1),\n\n(500)\n\nwhile the z-component of the spin is equal to\nhs\u02c6z i = hAlm Ylm |s\u02c6z |Alm Ylm i(hAlm Ylm |Alm Ylm i)\u22121 = m.\n\n(501)\n\nThe unit-fields (particles) with the Laplace ACs and the spins describing by Eqs. (500) and (501) could correspond\nto the elementary particles describing by integer spins. It should be noted in this regard that the classical (Newton)\nintrinsicP\norbital angular momentum L = r \u00d7 p and relativistic (Einstein) intrinsic orbital angular momentum tensor\nLnm = (xn pm \u2212 xm pn ) of a point particle are always equal to zero if p 6= \u221e. In canonical quantum mechanics\nand SM, the spins of the point (structure-less) particles have been engineered formally by using the operator or\nmatrix formalism. In the present model, the unit-fields (particles) obey naturally the spins attributed to the physical\nproperties of the respective ACs [see, (489) - (501)], which do not require the physical interpretation of any abstract\nmathematical object, such as an operator or matrix. The angular distribution of the AC function does not change in\nthe conservative physical processes due to the conservation law for the spin and energy. Therefore the knowledge of\nthe exact angular distribution of the AC function could not be important for description of the physical processes.\nFor such a description, the model of the unit-field spin can be represented as the formal matrix algebra or operator\nformalism, like the matrix algebra and operator formalism of the spin used in the canonical quantum mechanics and\nSM. The transition from the AC function associated with the material associate-component of the real (material)\nunit-field to the matrix representation or operator formalism is quit similar to the transition from the Schr\u00f6dinger\nwave model of quantum mechanics to the Heisenberg or Pauli matrix (operator) models based on the matrix (operator)\ncommutation relations. The presented model, probably for the first time, presents a physical explanation of a particle\nspin without using the physical interpretations of the abstract matrix algebra or operator formalism.\nThe general regular solution to Laplace's equation (489) is a linear combination of the regular solid harmonics\nmultiplied by the appropriate scale factors Alm :\n\u03a6an (r) =\n\n\u221e X\nl\nX\n\nl=0 m=\u2212l\n\nAlm rl Ylm (\u03b8, \u03c6),\n\n(502)\n\n\f112\nwhere Alm are the scaling constants. Correspondingly, the general irregular solution to Laplace's equation (489) is a\nlinear combination of the irregular solid harmonics multiplied by the scale factors Blm :\n\u03a6an (r) =\n\n\u221e X\nl\nX\n\nBlm r\u2212l\u22121 Ylm (\u03b8, \u03c6),\n\n(503)\n\nl=0 m=\u2212l\n\nwhere Blm denotes the appropriate scaling constants. Then the general solution to Eq. (489), which includes both\nthe regular and irregular solid harmonics is given by\n\u03a6an (r) =\n\n\u221e X\nl\nX\n\n[Alm rl + Blm r\u2212l\u22121 ]Ylm (\u03b8, \u03c6).\n\n(504)\n\nl=0 m=\u2212l\n\nThe linear combinations of the regular and irregular solid harmonics can describe the complicated configurations, such\nas the asymmetric ACs. The transformations associated, for instance, with the group of rotations or translations,\nas well as the conformal symmetry properties of the solutions of the types (490), (491), (498), (499), (502) - (504),\nhave been investigated in the past by the well-known \"potential theory\" and the theory of Laplace's equation (for the\ndetails, see the mathematical textbooks).\nThe relativistic and non-relativistic energies of the unit-field (particle) \u03c80n = \u03c8\u03030n \u03a6an with the Laplace ACs are\ndetermined respectively by Eq. (480) - Eq. (483) and Eq. (485) - Eq. (488). For an example, for the two-component\nunit-fields (particles) with the Laplace gravitational and electrical ACs (\u03932Gn = 0 and \u03932En = 0, for details see Sec.\n7.2), the relativistic and non-relativistic energies are given by Eqs.

The single unit-fields (particles) with the spherical symmetries of the Helmholtz ACs\nThe Helmholtz (\u03932In 6= 0) equation (473) describing the Helmholtz AC of the unit-field (particle) \u03c80n = \u03c8\u03030n \u03a6an in\nspherical coordinates has the form\n\"\n#\n1 \u22022\nL\u03022\n2\na 2\na\na 2\n[\u2207 + \u0393In ]\u03a6n (r) =\n(507)\nr \u2212 2 + \u0393In \u03a6an (r) = 0,\nr \u2202r2\nr\nwhere the eigen parameter \u0393aIn 2 denotes a positive or negative constant corresponding to the real (\u0393aIn = |\u0393aIn |) or\nimaginary (\u0393aIn = i|\u0393aIn |) value of \u0393aIn .\nThe two linearly independent well-known solutions to Eq. (507) are related to the spherical Bessel functions of the\nfirst and second kind. The first solution in a ball centered at the origin, which is associated with the spherical Bessel\nfunctions of the first kind, is given by\n\u03a6an (r) = jl (\u0393aIn r)Alm Ylm (\u03b8, \u03c6),\n\n(508)\n\nwhere Alm is the scaling constant that determines the value of the unit-field (particle) spin, jl (\u0393aIn r) is the spherical\nBessel function of the first kind with the real (\u0393aIn r = |\u0393aIn |r) or imaginary (\u0393aIn r = i|\u0393aIn |r) argument, and Ylm (\u03b8, \u03c6)\ndenotes the spherical harmonic determining by Eqs.

In the terms of the modified Bessel functions of\nthe first kind, which have the real arguments |\u0393aIn |r, the spherical Bessel function of the first kind with the imaginary\nargument is given by\njl (i|\u0393aIn |r) = il+1/2\n\nIl+1/2 (|\u0393aIn |r)\n,\n(\u03c0 \u22121 2i|\u0393aIn |r)1/2\n\n(509)\n\n\f113\nwhere Il+1/2 (|\u0393aIn |r) is the modified Bessel function of the first kind with the real argument.

In order to be in agreement with the Newton and Einstein gravitations, the gravitational\nparameter (588), which does not depend on the value R at the distances R >> r0G , should be adjusted to the value of\nthe Newton gravitational constant. Notice, the dependence \u03b3G = \u03b3G (R, r0G ) at the extremely small (R \u223c r0G ) distances\nbetween the two unit-fields (particles) gives the new inside the physics of the non-quantum and quantum gravitations.\nThe weak-relativistic (E12,21 << \u03b5201 + \u03b5202 ) interaction forces (354) and (355) acting upon the first and second\nunit-fields (particles) have respectively the forms\n\u0015 \u0014\n\u0015\n\u0014\nm01 m02 R\nm01 m02 R\nk02\n1 \u2202\nk01\n+ \u03b3G\n(589)\n\u00d7\n\u00d7 \u03b3G\nF12 (R) = \u2212\nE12,21 (R) =\n2 \u2202R\nm01\nm02\nR2 R\nR2 R\nand\n\u0015 \u0014\n\u0015\n\u0014\nm01 m02 R\nm01 m02 R\nk02\nk01\n1 \u2202\n\u2212 \u03b3G\n,\n\u00d7\n\u00d7 \u03b3G\nE12,21 (R) = \u2212\nF21 (R) =\n2 \u2202R\nm01\nm02\nR2 R\nR2 R\n\n(590)\n\nThe forces (589) and (590) acting between the \"moving\" (k01 = k02 = k0 6= 0) unit-fields could be considered as\nthe Lorentz-like gravitational forces.

Thus, in the terms of electrostatics, the gravitational force\nacting between the unit-fields (particles) at rest could be interpreted as the Newton (\"electrostatic\") force inducing\nby the electric-like gravitational field of the \"non-moving masses\". The fifth gravitational force (interaction energy)\ncould be considered as the \"magnetostatic\" gravitational force (interaction energy) mediating by the magnetic-like\ngravitational field of the \"moving masses\". In the terms of electrostatics and magnetostatics, the combined action\nof the electric-like and magnetic-like gravitational fields could be interpreted as the Lorentz-like gravitational force\nmediating by the electric-like and magnetic-like gravitational fields.\nEquations (589) - (603) are valid for the weak relativistic (E12,21 << \u03b5201 + \u03b5202 ) interaction, which is the case of\nthe most of experimental conditions. The other two interaction conditions, namely the strong relativistic and nonrelativistic gravitational interactions, are also possible. Under the strong relativistic (E12,21 \u223c \u03b5201 + \u03b5202 ) gravitational\ninteraction, which corresponds to the extremely small distance R \u223c r0 , one should use the above-derived equations\nwith the relations (347), (350) and (351) instead of the relations (354) and (355). The strong-relativistic gravitational\ninteraction forces (350) and (351) acting upon the first and second unit-fields (particles) have respectively the forms\n1 \u2202\n\u03b512,21 (R)\n2 \u2202R\n\n(604)\n\n1 \u2202\n\u03b512,21 (R),\n2 \u2202R\n\n(605)\n\nF12 (R) = \u2212\nand\nF21 (R) =\n\n\f124\nwhere the gravitational interaction energy \u03b512 (R) is given by Eq. (347) as\n\u03b512,21 = (\u03b5201 + \u03b5202 + E12,21 )1/2 \u2212 (\u03b501 + \u03b502 ),\n\n(606)\n\nwith the relativistic cross-correlation (interaction) total term E12,21 given by Eqs. (575) - (586). It should be stressed\nthat Eqs. (575) - (603) are valid in the particular case of the de Broglie generators of the unit-fields having the same\nmoments. Although the distance R \u223c r0 probably can be realized in some very particular experimental conditions,\nfor instance inside a cosmological black hole, the unit-field generators of such unit-fields (particles) are not the de\nBroglie waves. In other words, the strong relativistic gravitational interaction of the real unit-fields (particles) should\nbe described rather by the equations (604) - (606) than Eqs. (587) - (603).\nThe gravitational interaction between the two unit-fields determining by Eqs. (575) - (596) may be interpreted\nnot only by using the \"electric-like\" and \"magnetic-like\" gravitational fields and potentials [Eqs. (597) - (603)], but\nalso in the terms of the virtual particles. The relativistic energy of the composite field (particle) composed from the\ngravitationally interacting unit-fields (particles) is given by Eq. (381) as\n\u03b52 = \u03b5201 + \u03b5202 + E12 + E21 = \u03b5201 + \u03b5202 + E12,21 .\n\n(607)\n\nThe energies squared \u03b5201 and \u03b5202 could be attributed to the \"moving\" and \"non-moving\" masses of the 1st and 2nd\nrelativistic normal unit-fields (elementary particles). The gravitational cross-correlation terms E12 = E12 (m01 , m02 )\nand E21 = E21 (m02 , m01 ) could be attributed to the \"moving\" and \"non-moving\" masses of the 1st and 2nd relativistic\nnormal unit-fields. The gravitational cross-correlation terms E12 and E21 associated with the masses and gravitational\ninteractions may be considered as the 3rd and 4th virtual relativistic unit-fields (elementary particles) attributed to the\nrelativistic gravitational interaction. Thus the relativistic gravitational interaction between the two normal relativistic\nunit-fields (elementary particles) could be considered (interpreted) as the interplay of the four unit-fields (particles),\nwhere the composite field (particle) is composed from the 1st and 2nd normal unit-fields (particles) and the 3rd and\n4th virtual unit-fields (particles). In the case of the weak relativistic (E12,21 << \u03b5201 + \u03b5202 ) interaction, the energy\n\u03b512,21 = \u03b512,21 (E12,21 ) of the 3rd and 4th virtual unit-fields (particles) is given by Eq. (353). For more details of the\nvirtual-particle interpretation see the comments to Eq. (381). The virtual relativistic unit-fields (elementary particles),\nwhich carry the gravitational force and energy, logically to call the virtual gravitons. Since the physical properties of\nthe interaction energy attributed to the energy of the 3rd and 4th virtual relativistic unit-fields (elementary particles)\nare determined by the gauge (473) with the eigen parameter \u03932G = \u0393G1 \u0393G2 = 0, which could be interpreted in the\ntotal (effective) mass (m01 m02 + \u0393G1 \u0393G2 )1/2 = (m01 m02 )1/2 as the gauge-mass squared of the gravitational AC, the\nvirtual particles may be considered as the mass-less gauge bosons (virtual mass-less gauge gravitons). The name\nvirtual graviton corresponds to the hypothetical carrier of the quantum gravitation in the modern literature devoted\nto the quantum gravitational fields and interactions. In the frame of the Heisenberg energy uncertainty relation and\nthe perturbation approximation, the long range of the gravitational interaction may be formally (phenomenologically)\nattributed to absence of the rest mass of gravitons. However, the present model gives the microscopic explanation of\nthe phenomenon. The long range of the gravitational interaction is attributed to the long-range geometrical factor\nfG (R) \u223c 1/R (585) of the unit-fields with the irregular Laplace-ACs, where the field strength of the gravitational\ninteraction is determined by the gravitation constant \u03b3G (588). One should not confuse the non-virtual, massless, one-component gravitational unit-fields (non-virtual gravitons) describing by Eq. (400) with the rest mass\nm0 = 0 and the index I = G, which has the form \u03c6Gn \u0003\u03c8\u03030n + \u03c8\u03030n \u0003\u03c6Gn = 0. The non-virtual gravitational unitfields (gravitons) that satisfy this equation have the structure-less form (235) of the the time-harmonic plane waves\n\u221a\n\u03c80n (r, t) = \u03c8\u03030n (r, t)\u03c6Gn (r, t) = a0n ei(k0n r\u2212\u03b50n t) with the generator \u03c8\u03030n (r, t) = a0n ei([k0n /2]r\u2212[\u03b50n /2]t) and associate\u221a\ncomponent \u03c6Gn (r, t) = a0n ei([k0n /2]r\u2212[\u03b50n /2]t) that are indistinguishable from each other. The non-virtual gravitons\nhave the zero rest-mass (m0 = 0) with the respective energy-mass relation \u03b520n = k20n . In contrast to the massive\nunit-fields (particles), which obey the time-independent ACs (\u03c6\u0307Gn = 0), the non-virtual, mass-less, one-component\ngravitational unit-fields (non-virtual gravitons) have the time-dependent ACs (\u03c6\u0307Gn 6= 0). In such a case the gauge\n(402) provides the balance between the temporal and spatial variations of the non-virtual gravitational unit-field\n(non-virtual graviton). Notice, in the case of the unit-field \u03c80n (r, t) = \u03c8\u03030n \u03a6an with the TAC \u03a6an = 1, the structureless unified unit-field \u03c80n attributed to the n-th unified elementary particle is indistinguishable from the unit-field\ngenerator \u03c8\u03030n (for comparison, see Eq. (392) and the relevant examples in Sec. I of the present study).\nFor the sake of simplicity, I have presented the model [Eqs. (575) - (607)] for the two (N = 2) unit-fields (particles)\nwith the moments k01 = k02 = k0 . One can easily follow the model for an arbitrary number N of the unitfields (particles) having the de Broglie generators \u03c8\u03030n (r, t) = a0 ei(k0n r\u2212\u03b50n t) with the moments k0n = \u00b1k0 . The\nmodel with N >> 1 describes the classical (non-quantum) gravitational fields and interactions that correspond to\nthe case of Newton's and Einstein's gravitations (non-quantum gravitations). The model based on Eqs. (604) -\n\n\f125\n(606) corresponds to the case of quantum gravitation. It should be stressed that among the unit-fields (particles)\nwith the intrinsic \"magnetic\" quantum numbers sn = \u22121, 0, 1 of the unit-field spin only the unit-fields (particles) with\nsn = 0 demonstrate the spin-less (non-quantum) behavior [E12,21 (R, s1 , s2 ) = E12,21 (R)] that satisfies the non-quantum\n(Newton and Einstein) gravitation [Eqs. (587) - (603)]. The spin-less (non-quantum) gravitational interaction of the\nunit-field (particles) with the gravitational ACs having sn = 0 could be considered as the pure-attractive interaction of\nboson-like unit-fields (bosons) that explains the Bose-Einstein condensation and statistics of such unit-fields (particles).\nThe spin-dependent (quantum) gravitational interaction between the two unit-fields is described by the interaction\nenergy E12,21 (R, s1 , s2 ) determining by Eqs. (575) - (586) with the intrinsic \"magnetic\" quantum numbers (s1 = 1,\ns2 = 1), (s1 = \u22121, s2 = \u22121), (s1 = 1, s2 = \u22121) or (s1 = \u22121, s2 = 1). If the unit-field (particles) with sn = 1 and\nsn = \u22121 do exist somewhere in Universe, then Eqs. (354) and (355) and Eqs. (350) and (351) should determine the\nrepulsive (s1 = s2 ) and attractive (s1 6= s2 ) quantum-gravitational forces between the unit-fields (particles). The spindependent (quantum) gravitational interaction of the unit-field (particles) with the gravitational ACs having sn 6= 0\ncould be considered as the gravitational interaction of the fermion-like unit-fields (fermions). The spin-dependent\n(quantum) gravitational interaction that attract or repel the fermion-like unit-fields (particles) could be considered as\na physical background of the Pauli exclusion principle and the Fermi-Dirac statistic of the gravitationally interacting\nunit-fields (particles). It should be also noted that in the case of the two normal unit-fields (elementary particles)\nhaving the same \"magnetic\" numbers s1 = s2 , the unit-fields (particles) can annihilate. Indeed, the unit-fields are the\nsolutions of the equations of motions of the present model for both the A1sn and \u2212A1sn amplitudes. The Laplace-AC\namplitude A1n sn can be an arbitrary constant [see, Eq. (499)]. The two unit-fields with s1 = s2 can satisfy the\nannihilation condition in the case A1s1 = \u2212A1s2 . The unit-field (particle) with the positive value of A1s1 could be\nconsidered as a normal unit-field (particle), while the unit-field (particle) with the negative value of A1s2 could be\nconsidered as an anti unit-field (anti-particle).\nThe annihilation of the gravitationally interacting unit-fields with the spins s1 = s2 = 0 does not require adjustments\nof the unit-field spins in contrast to the gravitationally interacting unit-fields with the spins s1 = s2 = \u00b11 . The more\neasy annihilation of the gravitationally interacting unit-fields with the spins sn = 0 in comparison to the unit-fields\nhaving the spins s1 = s2 = \u00b11 should result into domination of the non-zero spin unit-fields. The absence of the\ngravitationally interacting unit-fields with the spins sn 6= 0, if they really have been created under the cosmological\nBig Bang, could be considered as a fact that such unit-fields (particles) have been produced in the negligible amount\nin comparison to the gravitationally interacting unit-fields with the spins s1 = s2 = 0. It should be noted again\nthat Eqs. (575) - (603) are valid in the particular case of the de Broglie generators \u03c8\u030301 (r, t) = a0 ei(k01 r\u2212\u03b501 t) (566)\nand \u03c8\u030302 (r, t) = a0 ei(k02 r\u2212\u03b502 t) (567). If the unit-field generators are not the de Broglie time-harmonic plane-waves,\nthen the pure gravitational interaction of the unit-fields (particles) are determined rather by the general Eqs. (546)\n- (556) than the particular Eqs. (575) - (603). One can easily follow the present model for any hypothetical unitfield (particle) with the spherically symmetric regular Laplace-AC (498) if such a kind of elementary particles exists\nsomewhere in the Universe. Notice, the unit-fields with the spherically symmetric regular Laplace-ACs (498) should\nhave the finite external dimensions.\n2. The Coulomb and Lorentz interactions of the electrically charged unit-fields (particles): The non-quantum and\nquantum pure electromagnetisms\nAmong the unit-fields (particles) (538) and (539) having the de Broglie generators (566) and (567) and the spherically\nsymmetric regular (498) or irregular (499) Laplace-ACs only the one-component unit-fields (538) with the irregular\nLaplace-ACs and the intrinsic orbital quantum number ln = 1 and the intrinsic \"magnetic\" quantum numbers sn =\n\u22121, 0, 1 may be considered as candidates for the pure electromagnetism describing by the Coulomb and Lorentz\ninteractions of the electrically charged unit-fields (particles) with the interaction energy \u223c 1/R. Among the candidates,\nthe only unit-fields with the quantum numbers ln = 1 and sn = \u00b11 obey the physical properties of the quantum\nelectromagnetism. Since the ACs of the electrically-charged unit-fields (particles) are indistinguishable from the ACs\nof the gravitationally interacting unit-fields (particles), the electrically and gravitationally interacting unit-fields are\ndescribed by the similar interaction (cross-correlation) total terms. Although the descriptions are similar in many\naspects, the physical nature of the electrical ACs associated with the electric charges of the unit-fields is different from\nthe gravitational ACs associated with the unit-field masses. For the comparison, see the previous section devoted to\nthe gravitation. In the case of the first irregular Laplace-AC \u03c6i1 (r) = \u03c6C1 (r) centered at the origin and the second\nirregular Laplace-AC \u03c6i2 (r \u2212 R) = \u03c6C2 (r \u2212 R) located at the distance R = |R| \u2261 |R12 | in the azimuthal direction,\nthe relativistic electric (Coulomb) interaction (cross-correlation) total term (571) has the form (575):\n#\n\"\nZ \u03c0\nZ 2\u03c0\nZ \u221e\n1 f (r, R, \u03b8, \u03c6, s1 , s2 )\n2\n2\n+\nd\u03b8sin\u03b8\nd\u03c6\nr dr 2\nE12,21 (R, l1 , l2 , s1 , s2 ) = k01 k02 A1s1 A1s2 a0\nr\n|r \u2212 R|2\n0\n\u03b8=0\n\u03c6=0\n\n\f126\n+m01 m02\n\n\"\n\nA1s1 A1s2 a20\n\nZ\n\n\u03c0\n\nd\u03b8sin\u03b8\n\n\u03b8=0\n\nZ\n\n2\u03c0\n\nd\u03c6\n\n\u03c6=0\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\n#\n1 f (r, R, \u03b8, \u03c6, s1 , s2 )\n,\nr dr 2\nr\n|r \u2212 R|2\n2\n\n0\n\n(608)\n\nwhere\n\u03932i1 = \u03932i2 = 0 = \u03932C1 = \u03932C2 = 0\nl1 = l2 = 1.\n\n(609)\n\nHere, the angle factor f (r, R, \u03b8, \u03c6, s1 , s2 ) associated with the spherical harmonics is given by\nf (r, R, \u03b8, \u03c6, s1 , s2 ) = Yls11 \u2217 (\u03b8, \u03c6)Yls22 (\u03b8, \u03c62 ) + Y1s11 (\u03b8, \u03c6)Y1s22 \u2217 (\u03b8, \u03c62 ),\n\n(610)\n\nwhere the intrinsic orbital quantum numbers have the values l1 = l2 = 1, the intrinsic \"magnetic\" quantum numbers\nhave the values s1 = \u22121, 0, 1 and s2 = \u22121, 0, 1. The other parameters have the meanings of the previous section\ndevoted to the gravitation. Notice, a simple analysis also shows that Eqs. (572) - (574) derived by using the nonrelativistic (Newton) approximation of the unit-field (particle) energy do not describe correctly the interaction of\nelectrically charged unit-fields (particles). That means that the electrically charged unit-fields (elementary particles)\nare relativistic objects describing rather by the Einstein particle energy than by the Newton particle energy. In order to\nexclude the singularities in the particle self-interaction energy (410) and the cross-interaction energy (608) associated\nwith the points r = 0 and r \u2212 R = 0, one should suppose that the electric (Coulomb) ACs \u03c6C1 (r) and \u03c6C2 (r \u2212 R) are\nhollow around these points in the bolls of the Coulomb radius r0C , which could be different in the general case from the\ngravitational radius (r0C 6= r0G ). The calibration of unit-fields by the cut-off of the AC fields around the singular points\nyields the relativistic electric (Coulomb) interaction (cross-correlation) term with the modified integration boundaries:\nE12,21 (R, s1 , s2 ) = k01 k02 fC + m01 m02 fC ,\n\n(611)\n\nwhere the electrical (Coulomb) geometrical factor\nfC = fC (R, s1 , s2 )\n\n(612)\n\nis given by\nfC (R, s1 , s2 ) =\n\nA1s1 A1s2 a20\n\nZ\n\n\u03c0\n\nd\u03b8sin\u03b8\n\n\u03b8=0\n\nZ\n\n2\u03c0\n\nd\u03c6\n\n\u03c6=0\n\nZ\n\nC\nR\u2212r0,low\n/2\n\nZ\n\nr0C\n\n\u221e\n\ndr\n\nC\nR+r0,up\n/2\n\nf (r, R, \u03b8, \u03c6, s1 , s2 )\n.\n|r \u2212 R|2\n\n(613)\n\nA simple analysis shows that the radius\nr = r0C\n\n(614)\n\ncould be considered as the classical radius of an electrically interacting particle. The introduction of the integration\nboundary r0C of an electrically interacting unit-field (particle) into the present model explains in the microscopical\ndetails why the canonical quantum mechanics, quantum field theories and SM of the dimension-less point-particles do\nrequire different renormalization procedures to avoid the field singularities and divergences. In fact, the renormalization\nprocedure is a \"hidden\" introduction of the dimension r0C of the dimension-less point-particle. Among the unit-fields\n(particles) with the intrinsic magnetic quantum numbers sn = \u22121, 0, 1 only the unit-field (particles) with sn = 0\ndemonstrate the \"spin-less\" behavior [E12,21 (R, s1 , s2 ) = E12,21 (R)] that satisfy the non-quantum (Coulomb and\nLorentz) interactions. The infinite upper integration limit in Eqs. (608) and (613) corresponding to the infinite ACs\nof the unit-fields is in agreement with the infinite fields of the Coulomb and Lorentz interactions. If the spin numbers\ns1 = s2 = 0, then the relativistic electric interaction (cross-correlation) total term is given by Eqs. (608) - (613) as\nE12,21 (R) =\n\nk01 k02 h\nq01 q02 i\nq01 q02 i h\n+ 2\u03b3C\n,\n2\u03b3C\nm01 m02\nR\nR\n\n(615)\n\nwhere the strength of interaction is determined by the interaction parameter\n\u03b3C =\n\n(1/2)R[A1s1 (q01 /m01 )][A1s2 (q02 /m02 )]a20\n\nZ\n\n\u03c0\n\nd\u03b8sin\u03b8\n\u03b8=0\n\nZ\n\n2\u03c0\n\n\u03c6=0\n\nd\u03c6\n\nZ\n\nG\nR\u2212r0,low\n/2\n\nr0G\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\nG\nR+r0,up\n/2\n\ndr\n\nf (r, R, \u03b8, \u03c6, 0, 0)\n,(616)\n|r \u2212 R|2\n\n\f127\nwhile the long range of the interaction is attributed to the long-range geometrical factor fC (R) \u223c 1/R of the unitfields with the irregular Laplace-ACs. Notice, the Laplace-AC amplitude A1n sn can be an arbitrary constant [see, Eq.\n(499)]. In Eq. (616), the amplitude A1n sn is presented in the form A1n sn (q0n /m0n ) that corresponds to the electric\n(electromagnetic) interaction mediating by the electrical (Coulomb) charges. To satisfy the Coulomb and Lorentz\ninteractions, the electrical parameter (616) that does not depend on the value R at the distances R >> r0C , should\nbe adjusted to the Coulomb constant. The value q01 = \u00b1|q01 | and q02 = \u00b1|q02 | could be interpreted as the electric\ncharges of the first and second unit-fields (particles). Unlike in the traditional quantum field theories, the LaplaceAC amplitude associated with the electric charge of the electromagnetically interacting unit-field (particle) gives the\nphysical (non-phenomenological) explanation of the electric charge. Notice, the fact that the electrical interaction\nparameter \u03b3C = \u03b3C (R, r0G ) depends on the length scale at the extremely small (R \u223c r0C ) distances between the two\nunit-fields (particles) gives the new inside the physics of the non-quantum and quantum electromagnetism.\nThe weak-relativistic (E12,21 << \u03b5201 + \u03b5202 ) interaction forces (354) and (355) acting upon the first and second\nelectrically charged unit-fields (particles) have respectively the forms\n\u0015 \u0014\n\u0015\n\u0014\nq01 q02 R\nq01 q02 R\nk02\nk01\n1 \u2202\n+ \u03b3C\n(617)\n\u00d7\n\u00d7 \u03b3C\nE12,21 (R) =\nF12 (R) = \u2212\n2 \u2202R\nm01\nm02\nR2 R\nR2 R\nand\n\u0015 \u0014\n\u0015\n\u0014\nq01 q02 R\nq01 q02 R\nk02\nk01\n1 \u2202\n\u2212 \u03b3C\n,\n\u00d7\n\u00d7 \u03b3C\nE12,21 (R) = \u2212\nF21 (R) =\n2 \u2202R\nm01\nm02\nR2 R\nR2 R\n\n(618)\n\nThe forces (617) and (618) acting between the \"moving\" (k01 = k02 = k0 6= 0) unit-fields could be considered as the\nLorentz forces.

Thus, in the terms of electrostatics, the electrostatic force acting between the charged\nunit-fields (particles) at rest could be interpreted as the Coulomb force inducing by the electric field of the \"non-moving\ncharges\". The magnetostatic force (interaction energy) could be considered as the magnetostatic force (interaction\nenergy) mediating by the magnetic field of the \"moving charges\". The combined action of the electric and magnetic\nfields could be interpreted as the Lorentz force mediating by the electric and magnetic fields. One could mention\n\n\f128\nthat the above-presented \"elementary\" magnetic and electric fields do satisfy the well-known electrodynamic relation\nB = v \u00d7 E = m\u22121 k \u00d7 E for the macroscopic magnetic and electric fields.\nEquations (615) - (625) describe the weak relativistic (E12,21 << \u03b5201 + \u03b5202 ) interactions between charged unitfields. The other two interaction conditions, namely the strong relativistic and non-relativistic interactions between\nelectrically charged unit-fields, are also possible. Under the strong relativistic (E12,21 \u223c \u03b5201 + \u03b5202 ) interaction, which\ncorresponds the extremely small distance R \u223c r0C , one should use the above-derived equations with the relations\n(347), (350) and (351) instead of the relations (354) and (355). The strong-relativistic interaction forces (350) and\n(351) acting upon the first and second unit-fields (particles) have respectively the forms\n1 \u2202\n\u03b512,21 (R)\n2 \u2202R\n\n(626)\n\n1 \u2202\n\u03b512,21 (R),\n2 \u2202R\n\n(627)\n\nF12 (R) = \u2212\nand\nF21 (R) =\n\nwhere the interaction energy \u03b512 (R) is given by Eq. (347) as\n\u03b512,21 = (\u03b5201 + \u03b5202 + E12,21 )1/2 \u2212 (\u03b501 + \u03b502 ),\n\n(628)\n\nwith the relativistic cross-correlation (interaction) total term E12,21 given by Eqs. (601) - (607). It should be stressed\nthat Eqs. (615) - (625) are valid in the particular case of the de Broglie electromagnetic generators \u03c8\u03030n of the unitfields having the same moments. Although the distance R \u223c r0 can be easily realized experimentally, the unit-field\ngenerators of such unit-fields (particles) are not the de Broglie waves because of the strong interaction. That is to say\nthat the strong relativistic interaction of the charged unit-fields (particles) should be described rather by the equations\n(617) - (619) than Eqs. (615) - (625).\nThe Coulomb and Lorentz interaction between the two electrically-charged unit-fields determining by Eqs. (608) (628) may be interpreted not only by using the electric and magnetic fields and potentials [Eqs. (619) - (625)], but\nalso in the terms of the virtual particles. The relativistic energy of the composite charged-field (particle) composed\nfrom the electromagnetically interacting unit-fields (particles) is given by Eq. (381) as\n\u03b52 = \u03b5201 + \u03b5202 + E12 + E21 = \u03b5201 + \u03b5202 + E12,21 .\n\n(629)\n\nThe energies squared \u03b5201 and \u03b5202 , which do not depend on the electric charges of the 1st and the 2nd unit-fields\n(elementary particles), could be attributed to the \"moving\" and \"non-moving\" masses of the 1st and 2nd relativistic\nnormal unit-fields (particles). The electrical cross-correlation terms E12 = E12 (q01 , q02 ) and E21 = E21 (q02 , q01 ) could be\nattributed to the \"moving\" and \"non-moving\" electric charges of the 1st and 2nd relativistic normal unit-fields. The\nelectrical cross-correlation terms E12 and E21 associated with the electric charges and electrical interactions could be\nconsidered as the 3rd and 4th virtual relativistic unit-fields (elementary particles) attributed to the relativistic electrical\ninteraction of the 1st and 2nd normal electrically charged unit-fields. Thus the relativistic electromagnetic interaction\nbetween the two normal electrically charged unit-fields (elementary particles) could be considered (interpreted) as\nthe interplay of the four unit-fields (particles), where the composite field (particle) is composed from the 1st and\n2nd normal charged unit-fields (particles) and the 3rd and 4th virtual unit-fields (particles). For more details of the\ninterpretation based on the use of virtual particles see the comments to Eq. (381). The virtual relativistic unit-fields\n(particles), which carry the electromagnetic (Coulomb and Lorentz) forces and energy, logically to call the virtual\nphotons. Since the physical properties of the interaction energy attributed to the energy of the 3rd and 4th virtual\nrelativistic unit-fields (particles) are determined by the gauge (473) with the eigen parameter \u03932C = \u0393C1 \u0393C2 = 0,\nwhich is interpreted in the total mass (m01 m02 + \u0393C1 \u0393C2 )1/2 = (m01 m02 )1/2 as the gauge-mass squared of the\nelectrical AC, the virtual particles may be considered as the mass-less gauge bosons (virtual mass-less gauge photons).\nIn the frame of the Heisenberg energy uncertainty relation and the perturbation approximation, the quantum field\ntheories and SM have phenomenologically attributed the long range of the electromagnetic (Lorentz) interaction to\nabsence of the rest mass of gravitons. The present model gives the microscopic explanation of the phenomenon.\nThe long range of the electromagnetic interaction is attributed to the long-range geometrical factor fC (R) \u223c 1/R\n(613) of the unit-fields with the irregular Laplace-ACs, where the field strength of the electromagnetic interaction is\ndetermined by the electrical (Coulomb) constant \u03b3C (616). Here, one should not confuse the non-virtual, mass-less,\none-component electromagnetic unit-fields (non-virtual photons) describing by Eq. (400) with the rest mass m0 = 0\nand the index I = C, which has the form \u03c6Cn \u0003\u03c8\u03030n + \u03c8\u03030n \u0003\u03c6Cn = 0. The non-virtual electromagnetic unit-fields (nonvirtual photons) that satisfy this equation have the structure-less form (235) of the the time-harmonic plane waves\n\n\f129\n\u221a\n\u03c80n (r, t) = \u03c8\u03030n (r, t)\u03c6Cn (r, t) = a0n ei(k0n r\u2212\u03b50n t) with the generator \u03c8\u03030n (r, t) = a0n ei([k0n /2]r\u2212[\u03b50n /2]t) and associate\u221a\ncomponent \u03c6Cn (r, t) = a0n ei([k0n /2]r\u2212[\u03b50n /2]t) that are indistinguishable from each other. The non-virtual photons\nhave the zero rest-mass (m0 = 0) with the respective energy-mass relation \u03b520n = k20n . In contrast to the massive\nunit-fields (particles), which obey the time-independent ACs (\u03c6\u0307Cn = 0), the non-virtual, mass-less, one-component\nelectromagnetic unit-fields (non-virtual photons) have the time-dependent ACs (\u03c6\u0307Cn 6= 0). In such a case the gauge\n(402) provides the balance between the temporal and spatial variations of the non-virtual electromagnetic unit-field\n(non-virtual photon). Notice, in the case of the unit-field \u03c80n (r, t) = \u03c8\u03030n \u03a6an with the TAC \u03a6an = 1, the structureless unified unit-field \u03c80n attributed to the n-th unified elementary particle is indistinguishable from the unit-field\ngenerator \u03c8\u03030n (for comparison, see Eq. (392) and the relevant examples in Sec. I of the present study)\nThe model [Eqs. (608) - (629)] describes interaction of the two (N = 2) electrically-charged unit-fields (particles)\nwith the moments k01 = k02 = k0 . One can easily follow the model for an arbitrary number N of the electricallycharged unit-fields (particles) having the de Broglie generators \u03c8\u03030n (r, t) = a0 ei(k0n r\u2212\u03b50n t) with the moments k0n =\n\u00b1k0 . The model [Eqs. (615) - (625)] with N >> 1 and sn = 0 describes the classical (non-quantum) electrostatic and\nmagnetostatic fields and interactions that correspond to the case of the Lorentz (non-quantum) interaction. In other\nwords, such a model corresponds to the non-quantum interactions of the classical electrostatics and magnetostatics of\nthe electrically-charged unit-fields (particles). Among the electrically-charged unit-fields (particles) with the intrinsic\nmagnetic quantum numbers sn = \u22121, 0, 1 of the unit-field spin, the only unit-field (particles) with the spin numbers\nsn \u2261 mn = 0 demonstrate the \"spin-less\" [E12,21 (R, s1 , s2 ) = E12,21 (R)] Lorentz classical behavior that satisfy the\nattractive (q01 = \u2212q02 ) and repulsive (q01 = q02 ) electrostatic interactions FC\n12 and the attractive (q01 = q02 , k01 = k02\nor q01 = \u2212q02 , k01 = \u2212k02 ) and repulsive (q01 = q02 , k01 = \u2212k02 or q01 = \u2212q02 , k01 = k02 ) magnetostatic interactions\nFM\n12 of the electrically-charged unit-fields (particles). The purely attractive spin-less (Lorentz-like) \"non-quantum\"\nM\ninteraction FC\n12 +F12 of the unit-field (particles) with the electric ACs having the spin numbers sn = 0, electric charges\nq01 = \u2212q02 and momentums k01 = \u2212k02 could be considered as the \"non-quantum\" classical attraction of charged unitfields [boson-like (q01 = \u2212q02 , k01 = \u2212k02 ) particles] that explains microscopically the Bose-Einstein condensation and\nstatistics of such particles. Although the \"spin-less\" (sn = 0) electrically charged unit-fields (particles) have not been\nyet detected, the model [Eqs. (615) - (625)] is good for the classical (Coulomb and Lorentz) description of the classical\nCoulomb and Lorentz forces. The spin-dependent quantum interaction between the two charged unit-fields, which is\nobserved experimentally, is described by the Lorentz-like spin-dependent quantum interaction energy E12,21 (R, s1 , s2 )\ndetermining by Eqs. (354), (355), (608) - (614) with the spin numbers (s1 = 1, s2 = 1), (s1 = \u22121, s2 = \u22121), (s1 = 1,\ns2 = \u22121) or (s1 = \u22121, s2 = 1). That is to say that Eqs. (354), (355), (608) - (614) determine the electromagnetic\nproperties of the electrically charged unit-field (particle) and their connections with the unit-field spin. A simple\nanalysis of Eqs. (354), (355), (608) - (614) for the two identically charged unit-fields shows that the equations describe\nthe repulsive (s1 = s2 , q01 = q02 , k01 = k02 ) and attractive (s1 6= s2 , q01 = q02 , k01 = k02 ) quantum forces associated\nwith the Lorentz-like spin-dependent (quantum) interaction energy of the electrically charged fermion-like unit-fields\n(fermions). The Pauli exclusion principle states that no two identical (s1 = s2 , q01 = q02 , k01 = k02 ) fermions may\noccupy the same quantum state simultaneously. The spin-dependent (quantum) repulsive or attractive interaction of\nthe identically charged (q01 = q02 ) unit-fields (fermions) having respectively the same (s1 = s2 ) or different (s1 6= s2 )\nspin numbers could be considered as the physical origin explaining microscopically the Pauli exclusion principle and the\nFermi-Dirac statistics of the fermions, which in canonical quantum mechanics and SM have nature of the unexplained\npostulates. Unlike in the traditional quantum field theory and SM, which consider rather the fields of operators than\nthe fields of particles, Eqs. (354), (355), (608) - (614) determine the electromagnetic properties of the electrically\ncharged unit-field (particle) and their connections with the unit-field spin naturally, without introduction of any pure\nmathematical object, like the spin matrix or operators. Moreover, Eqs. (354), (355), (608) - (614) explain, probably\nfor the first time, why the spin sn = \u00b11/2 of the electrically-charged electron (fermion) in the traditional quantum\nfield theory and SM is artificially increased in two times up to the value sn = 2(\u00b11/2) = \u00b11 in order to correspond\nthe experimentally observed value\n\u03bcn = \u03bcB 2(\u00b11/2) = \u00b1\u03bcB\n\n(630)\n\nof the electron (fermion) magnetic moment \u03bcn \u2261 \u03bcB sn , where \u03bcB = q0n /2m0 denotes the Bohr magneton. The\npresent model gives the correct magnetic moment of the electrically-charged unit-field (electron) having the spin\nsn = \u00b11 without any artificial adjustment:\n\u03bcn = \u03bcB (\u00b11) = \u00b1\u03bcB .\n\n(631)\n\nThat also means the present model obeys the same (unified) g-factor g = gS = gL = 1 for both the electron spin\ng-factor gS and the electron orbital g-factor gL , which in in the traditional quantum field theory and SM have the\n\n\f130\ndifferent values gS = 2 and gL = 1. Notice, the g-factor g = gS = gL = 1 corresponds to an electron placed into\nthe absolute vacuum (\"straight\" empty space). In the case of the unit-field (electron) interacting (interfering) with\nthe physical (non-absolute) vacuum associated with other spatially infinite or finite unit-fields, the value g is slightly\nlarger. The g-factor approaches the value corresponding to the anomalous magnetic moment of an electron in the\ntraditional quantum electrodynamics. It should be also noted that in the case of the two electrically charged normal\nunit-fields (particles) having the spin numbers s1 = s2 = \u00b11 and charges q01 = \u2212q02 , the unit-fields (particles)\ncan annihilate. Indeed, the charged unit-fields are the solutions of the equations of motions of the present model\nfor both the A1sn and \u2212A1sn amplitudes. The Laplace-AC amplitude A1n sn can be an arbitrary constant [see, Eq.\n(499)]. The two charged unit-fields with s1 = s2 can satisfy the annihilation condition in the case A1s1 = \u2212A1s2 . In\nEqs. (608) - (629), the charged unit-field (particle) with the positive value of A1s1 could be considered as a normal\nunit-field (particle), while the charged unit-field (particle) with the negative value of A1m2 could be considered as\nan anti-unitfield (anti-particle). The annihilation of the two charged unit-fields with s1 = s2 = 0 does not require\nadjustments of the unit-field spins. The easy annihilation of the charged unit-fields with sn = 0, if they really have\nbeen created under the cosmological Big Bang, could be considered as a physical mechanism of the absence of such\nunit-fields (particles) in the present Universe. It should be noted again that Eqs. (608) - (629) are valid in the\nparticular case of the de Broglie generators \u03c8\u030301 (r, t) = a0 ei(k01 r\u2212\u03b501 t) (566) and \u03c8\u030302 (r, t) = a0 ei(k02 r\u2212\u03b502 t) (567) . If\nthe unit-field generators are not the de Broglie plane-waves, then the pure electromagnetic interaction of the unitfields (particles) are determined rather by Eqs. (546) - (556) than Eqs. (608) - (625). The above-present model may\nbe easily reformulated for any hypothetical unit-field (particle) with the spherically symmetric regular Laplace-AC\n(498) if such a kind of elementary particles exists somewhere in the Universe. In such a case, the unit-fields with the\nspherically symmetric regular Laplace-ACs (498) should have the finite external dimensions.\n7.3. The interference (interaction) of the unit-fields (particles) having the de Broglie generators (\u03c8\u03030n ) and the\nspherically symmetric, one-component Helmholtz-ACs (\u03a6an ): The non-quantum and quantum pure-week and\npure-strong interactions\n\n1. The non-quantum and quantum pure-weak interactions of the unit-fields (particles)\nFor the sake of simplicity, I present here the equations for the two unit-fields, namely for the unit-fields \u03c801 = \u03c8\u030301 \u03a6a1\n(538) and \u03c802 = \u03c8\u030302 \u03a6a2 (539) of the composite field \u03c8 = \u03c8\u030301 \u03a6a1 + \u03c8\u030302 \u03a6a2 (540), where the total associate-components\n(TACs) have the one-component forms \u03a6a1 = \u03c6i1 and \u03a6a2 = \u03c6i2 , and the relevant values are given by k01 = k02 = k0 ,\n\u03b501 = \u03b502 = \u03b50 , m01 = m02 = m0 , \u03b11 = \u03b12 = \u03b10 and \u0393i1 = \u0393i2 = \u0393i . A simple analysis of the unit-fields (particles)\n(538) and (539) having the de Broglie generators \u03c8\u030301 (r, t) = a0 ei(k01 r\u2212\u03b501 t+\u03b11 ) (566) and \u03c8\u030302 (r, t) = a0 ei(k02 r\u2212\u03b502 t+\u03b12 )\n(567) and the spherically symmetric Helmholtz-ACs associated with the spherical Bessel functions of the first (508)\nor second (510) kind shows that only the one-component unit-fields (538) related to the spherical Bessel functions\n(508) of the first kind with the real (\u0393ain r = \u0393W n r = |\u0393W n |r) argument and the quantum numbers (ln = 0, sn = 0)\nor (ln = 1, sn = \u22121, 0, 1) are suitable for description of the pure-weak interactions of the unit-fields (particles) with\nthe short-range interaction energy. Moreover, among these unit-fields the only one-component unit-fields with the\nquantum numbers ln = 1 and sn = \u00b11 demonstrate the experimentally observed physical properties of the pure-weak\ninteraction. Indeed, in the case of the first Helmholtz-AC [\u03c6i1 = \u03c6W 1 (r)] centered at the origin and the second\nHelmholtz-AC [\u03c6i2 = \u03c6W 2 (r \u2212 R)] located at the distance R = |R| \u2261 |R12 | in the azimuthal direction, the relativistic\ninteraction (cross-correlation) total term (571) has the form\n#\n\"\nZ \u221e\nZ 2\u03c0\nZ \u03c0\nd\u03c6\nr2 drjl1 (\u0393W 1 r)jl2 (\u0393W 2 |r \u2212 R|)f +\nd\u03b8sin\u03b8\nE12,21 (R, l1 , l2 , s1 , s2 ) = k01 k02 Al1 s1 Al2 s2 a20\n\u03b8=0\n\n+ [m01 m02 +\n\n\u0393aI1 \u0393aI2 ]\n\n\"\n\nAl1 s1 Al2 s2 a20\n\nZ\n\n\u03c6=0\n\n\u03c0\n\n\u03b8=0\n\nd\u03b8sin\u03b8\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n2\u03c0\n\n\u03c6=0\n\nd\u03c6\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\n2\n\n0\n\n#\n\nr drjl1 (\u0393W 1 r)jl2 (\u0393W 2 |r \u2212 R|)f , (632)\n\nwhere\n\u0393ai1 = \u0393ai2 = \u0393W 1 = \u0393W 2 = |\u0393W 1 | = |\u0393W 2 | 6= 0\nl1 = l2 = 1.\n\n(633)\n\nHere, the angle factor f = f (r, R, \u03b8, \u03c6, l1 , l2 , s1 , s2 ) associated with the spherical harmonics has the form\nf (r, R, \u03b8, \u03c6, l1 , l2 , s1 , s2 ) = Yls11 \u2217 (\u03b8, \u03c6)Yls22 (\u03b8, \u03c62 ) + Yls11 (\u03b8, \u03c6)Yls22 \u2217 (\u03b8, \u03c62 ),\n\n(634)\n\n\f131\nwhere the intrinsic \"magnetic\" quantum numbers are given by s1 = \u22121, 0, 1 and s2 = \u22121, 0, 1, and \u03c62 = \u03c62 (r, R, \u03c6)\ndenotes the azimuthal angle associated with the vector r \u2212 R in the spherical coordinate system of the second\nHelmholtz-AC. Notice, a simple analysis also shows that Eqs. (572) - (574) derived by using the non-relativistic\n(Newton) approximation of the unit-field (particle) energy do not describe correctly the weak interaction of unit-fields\n(particles). That means that the weakly interacting unit-fields (elementary particles) are relativistic objects describing\nrather by the Einstein particle energy than by the Newton particle energy. Also note that the relativistic interaction\n(cross-correlation) total term E12,21 (R, l1 , l2 , s1 , s2 ) = 0 if the intrinsic orbital quantum numbers l1 6= l2 . That is to\nsay that the two one-component unit-fields having the different intrinsic orbital quantum numbers do not interact\nweakly with each other. To exclude the singularities in the particle self-energy (410) and the cross-correlation energy\n(632) associated with the points r = 0 and r \u2212 R = 0, one should suppose that the weakly interacting Helmholtz-ACs\n\u03c6W 1 (r) and \u03c6W 2 (r\u2212 R) are hollow around these points in the bolls of the radius r0W . A simple analysis shows that the\nW\ninfinite upper integration limit (rup\n= \u221e) in Eq. (632) is inconsistent with the finite fields and energies of the weak\ninteraction. Indeed, such a case corresponds to the infinite Helmholtz-ACs with infinite interaction energies. In order\nto satisfy the finite fields and energies of the weak interaction, one should suppose that the unit-field Helmholtz-AC\nW\nW\nof the weakly interacting unit-field is limited by the upper boundary of the radius rup\n< \u221e, where rup\n> r0W . In\nother words, the unit-field Helmholtz-AC vanishes above the AC upper boundary (integration limit). The calibration\nof unit-fields by the \"ultraviolet\" and \"infrared\" cut-offs of the AC fields yielded the relativistic weak interaction\n(cross-correlation) term E12,21 = E12,21 (R, l1 , l2 , s1 , s2 ) with the modified upper and lower integration limits:\nE12,21 (R, l1 , l2 , s1 , s2 ) = k01 k02 fW + [m01 m02 + \u0393W 1 \u0393W 2 ] fW ,\n\n(635)\n\nwhere the weak-interaction geometrical factor\nfW = fW (R, l1 , l2 , s1 , s2 )\n\n(636)\n\nis given by\nfW (R, l1 , l2 , s1 , s2 ) =\n= Al1 s1 Al2 s2 a20\n\nZ\n\n\u03c0\n\n\u03b8=0\n\nd\u03b8sin\u03b8\n\nZ\n\n2\u03c0\n\n\u03c6=0\n\nd\u03c6\n\nZ\n\nW\nR\u2212r0,low\n/2\n\nr0W\n\nZ\n\nW\nrup\n\nW\nR+r0,up\n/2\n\nr2 drjl1 (\u0393W 1 r)jl2 (\u0393W 2 |r \u2212 R|)f.\n\n(637)\n\nIt should be stressed that the Helmholtz-AC amplitude A1n sn can be an arbitrary constant [see, Eq. (508)], which cold\nbe called the weak isospin. If the n-th weakly interacting unit-field (particle) has the \"charge-like\" weak hypercharge\nQhn , which is different from the electric (Coulomb) charge, then the amplitude A1n sn in Eq. (637) could be presented\nin the form A1n sn (mn /Qhn ) that corresponds to the \"electric-like\" (\"electromagnetic-like\") weak interaction mediating\nby the hypercharge of the weakly interacting unit-field (particle) [for the comparison, see Eq. (616)]. Naturally, the\nHelmholtz-AC amplitude (weak isospins or weak hypercharges) of the unit-fields (particles) should be adjusted to the\nvalue corresponding to the experimentally observed parameters of the weak interaction. In contrast to the traditional\nquantum field theories, the Helmholtz-AC amplitude associated with the weak isospin or weak hypercharge of the\nweakly-interacting unit-field (particle) gives the physical (non-phenomenological) explanation of the weak isospin and\nweak hypercharge of an elementary particle. The radius\nW\nr = rup\n\n(638)\n\ncould be considered as the external radius of a weakly interacting unit-field (particle). The parameter r = r0W logically\nto associate with the classical radius of a weakly interacting particle. The value |r \u2212 R|, which is calculated by using\na simple geometrical analysis of the two vectors, is a function of the parameters r, R, \u03b8 and \u03c6. Correspondingly, the\nW\nW\nW\n, r0,up\nand rup\nare calculated by using this geometrical analysis as functions of the parameters\nintegration limits r0,low\nW\nW\nr, R, \u03b8, \u03c6, r0 and rup .\nIf the \"non-quantum\" (spin-independent) weak interaction does exist somewhere in the Universe, then the unitfields (particles) with de Broglie generators and the spherically symmetric Helmholtz-ACs associated with the spherical\nBessel functions of first kind and the quantum numbers ln = 0, sn = 0 could be attributed to such an interaction. In\nthe case of the unit-field Helmholtz-ACs with the quantum numbers l1 = l2 = 0 and s1 = s2 = 0, the spherical Bessel\nfunctions in Eq. (637) are given simply by\njl1 (\u0393W 1 r) = j0 (\u0393W 1 r) =\n\nsin(\u0393W 1 r)\n\u0393W 1 r\n\n(639)\n\n\f132\nand\njl2 (\u0393W 2 |r \u2212 R|) = j0 (\u0393W 2 |r \u2212 R|) =\n\nsin(\u0393W 2 |r \u2212 R|)\n,\n\u0393W 2 |r \u2212 R|\n\n(640)\n\nand the angle factor f = f (r, R, \u03b8, \u03c6, l1 , l2 , s1 , s2 ) = f (r, R, \u03b8, \u03c6, 0, 0, 0, 0) has the spin-independent form\n\u2217\n\n\u2217\n\nf (r, R, \u03b8, \u03c6, 0, 0, 0, 0) = Y00 (\u03b8, \u03c6)Y00 (\u03b8, \u03c62 ) + Y00 (\u03b8, \u03c6)Y00 (\u03b8, \u03c62 ) = 1/2\u03c0.\n\n(641)\n\nThe annihilation of the two weakly interacting unit-fields with the quantum numbers l1 = l2 = 0 and s1 = s2 = 0\ndoes not require adjustments of the unit-field spins. The easy annihilation of the weakly interacting unit-fields with\nl1 = l2 = 0 and s1 = s2 = 0, if they really have been created under the cosmological Big Bang, could be considered\nas a physical mechanism explaining the absence of such unit-fields (particles) at the present stage of Universe.\nThe physical properties of quantum (spin-dependent) weak interactions, which are observed experimentally, could\nbe attributed to the unit-fields (particles) having the de Broglie generators and the spherically symmetric HelmholtzACs associated with the spherical Bessel functions of the first kind and the quantum numbers ln = 1, sn = \u00b11. In\nthe case of l1 = l2 = 1 and s1 = \u00b11, s2 = \u00b11, the relativistic weak interaction (cross-correlation) term E12,21 =\nE12,21 (R, l1 , l2 , s1 , s2 ) is determine by Eqs.

The\nabsence of the weakly interacting unit-fields (particles) with the quantum numbers ln = 1 and sn = 0 in the present\nUniverse, if they have been created after the cosmological Big Bang, could be considered as s a physical mechanism\nexplaining of the absence of such unit-fields (particles) at the present stage of Universe. It should be noted that the\nrelativistic interaction (cross-correlation) total term E12,21 (R, l1 , l2 , s1 , s2 ) = 0 if the intrinsic orbital quantum numbers\nl1 6= l2 . The \"weak strength\" of the weakly interacting unit-field is attributed to the properties of the weak-interaction\nW\ngeometrical factor (637), while the short-range of the weak interaction is associated with the external radius rup\nof\nthe Helmholtz-AC.\nThe weak-relativistic (E12,21 << \u03b5201 + \u03b5202 ) interaction forces (354) and (355) acting upon the first and second\nunit-fields (particles) have respectively the forms\n1 \u2202\nE12,21 (R, l1 , l2 , s1 , s2 )\n2 \u2202R\n\n(645)\n\n1 \u2202\nE12,21 (R, l1 , l2 , s1 , s2 ).\n2 \u2202R\n\n(646)\n\nF12 (R) = \u2212\nand\nF21 (R) =\n\nAnalysis of Eqs. (632) - (646) shows that the weakly interacting unit-fields \u03c801 = \u03c8\u030301 \u03c6W 1 and \u03c802 = \u03c8\u030302 \u03c6W 2 indeed\nhave the finite interaction energies corresponding to the finite total interaction (cross-correlation) term E12,21 6= \u221e in\nW\nthe case of the Helmholtz-AC dimensions r0W 6= 0 and rup\n6= \u221e. The interaction energy decreases with the increase\nW\nW\nof the value R and approaches the zero value at R > rup . The dimensions r0W 6= 0 and rup\n6= \u221e should be adjusted\nto the values, which are in agreement with the physical properties of the weak interactions. The parameter r0W could\nW\nbe interpreted as the classical radius of the particle, while rup\nas the external radius of the unit-field determining the\nshort range of weak interactions Helmholtz-AC.\nEquations (632) - (646) are valid for the weak relativistic (E12,21 << \u03b5201 + \u03b5202 ) interaction, which is the case of\nthe most of experimental conditions. The other two interaction conditions, namely the strong relativistic and nonrelativistic weak interactions, are also possible. Under the strong relativistic (E12,21 \u223c \u03b5201 + \u03b5202 ) weak interaction,\n\n\f133\nwhich corresponds to the extremely small distance R \u223c r0 , one should use the above-derived equations with the\nrelations (347), (350) and (351) instead of the relations (354) and (355). The strong-relativistic weak-interaction\nforces (350) and (351) acting upon the first and second unit-fields (particles) have respectively the forms\n1 \u2202\n\u03b512,21 (R)\n2 \u2202R\n\n(647)\n\n1 \u2202\n\u03b512,21 (R),\n2 \u2202R\n\n(648)\n\nF12 (R) = \u2212\nand\nF21 (R) =\n\nwhere the weak-interaction energy \u03b512 (R) is given by Eq. (347) as\n\u03b512,21 = (\u03b5201 + \u03b5202 + E12,21 )1/2 \u2212 (\u03b501 + \u03b502 ),\n\n(649)\n\nwith the relativistic cross-correlation (interaction) total term E12,21 given by Eqs. (632) - (646). It should be stressed\nthat Eqs. (632) - (646) are valid in the particular case of the de Broglie generators of the unit-fields having the same\nmoments. Although the distance R \u223c r0 probably can be realized in some very particular experimental conditions, the\nunit-field generators of such unit-fields (particles) are not the de Broglie waves. In other words, the strong relativistic\nweak-interaction of the real unit-fields (particles) should be described rather by the equations (604) - (606) than Eqs.\n(587) - (603). A simple analysis also shows that Eqs. (572) - (574) derived by using the non-relativistic (Newton)\napproximation of the unit-field (particle) energy do not describe correctly the weak interactions. That means that the\nweakly interacting unit-fields (elementary particles) are relativistic objects describing rather by the Einstein particle\nenergy than by the Newton particle energy.\nThe weak interaction between the two unit-fields determining by Eqs. (632) - (646) may be interpreted not only by\nusing the \"electric-like\" and \"magnetic-like\" weak-interaction fields and potentials, which are somewhat similar to the\nrespective Eqs. (597) - (603), but also in the terms of the virtual particles. The relativistic energy of the composite\nfield (particle) composed from the weakly interacting unit-fields (particles) is given by Eq. (381) as\n\u03b52 = \u03b5201 + \u03b5202 + E12 + E21 = \u03b5201 + \u03b5202 + E12,21 .\n\n(650)\n\nThe energies squared \u03b5201 and \u03b5202 could be attributed to the \"moving\" and \"non-moving\" masses of the 1st\nand 2nd relativistic normal unit-fields (elementary particles). The weak-interaction cross-correlation terms E12 =\nE12 (m01 , \u0393W 1 ; m02 , \u0393W 2 ) and E21 = E21 (m02 , \u0393W 2 ; m01 , \u0393W 1 ) could be attributed to the \"moving\" and \"non-moving\"\nmasses m01 , m02 , \u0393W 1 and \u0393W 2 of the 1st and 2nd relativistic normal unit-fields. The weak-interaction crosscorrelation terms E12 and E21 associated with the masses m01 , m02 , \u0393W 1 and \u0393W 2 and the weak interactions may\nbe considered as interplay of the 3rd and 4th virtual relativistic unit-fields (elementary particles) attributed to the\nrelativistic weak-interaction of the 1st and 2nd normal massive unit-fields (elementary particles). Thus the relativistic weak-interaction between the two normal relativistic unit-fields (elementary particles) could be considered\n(interpreted) as the interplay of the four unit-fields (particles), where the composite field (particle) is composed\nfrom the 1st and 2nd normal unit-fields (particles) and the 3rd and 4th virtual unit-fields (particles). For more\ndetails of the interpretation based on the use of virtual particles see the comments to Eq. (381). The virtual relativistic unit-fields (elementary particles), which carry the weak force and energy, logically to call the virtual W or\nZ bosons mediated by the weak isospin or the weak hypercharge of the 1st and 2nd normal unit-fields (particles).\nThe names W and Z bosons correspond to the carriers of the weak interaction in the quantum field theories and\nSM. The weakly interacting normal unit-field (particle) with the mass m0n obey the relations m0n << \u0393W n . In\nsuch a case the weak-interaction cross-correlation terms are given by E12 (m01 , \u0393W 1 ; m02 , \u0393W 2 ) = E12 (\u0393W 1 , \u0393W 2 ) and\nE21 (m02 , \u0393W 2 ; m01 , \u0393W 1 ) = E21 (\u0393W 2 , \u0393W 1 ), where the values \u0393W 1 and \u0393W 2 could be interpreted as the gauge masses\nof the virtual W or Z bosons associated with the 1st and 2nd weakly interacting normal unit-fields (particles). In the\nframe of the Heisenberg energy uncertainty relation and the perturbation approximation, the short range of the weak\ninteraction is attributed phenomenologically (formally) by the quantum field theories and SM to the heaviness of the\nvirtual W and Z bosons. The present model gives the microscopic explanation of the phenomenon. The short-range of\nW\nthe weak interaction is attributed to the finite external radius rup\nof the heavy Helmholtz-AC of the weakly interacting\nunit-field (particle). It should be stressed that the parameter \u0393W n 6= 0 could be attributed to the mass of the weakly\ninteracting particles even in the case of the unit-fields (particles) that obey the zero rest-mass m0 = 0 [see, Eq. (483)].\nThe model [Eqs. (632) - (650)] describes interaction of the two (N = 2) weakly interacting unit-fields (particles) with\nthe moments k01 = k02 = k0 . One can easily follow the model for an arbitrary number N of the weakly interacting\nunit-fields (particles) having the de Broglie generators \u03c8\u03030n (r, t) = a0 ei(k0n r\u2212\u03b50n t) with the moments k0n = \u00b1k0 . The\n\n\f134\nmodel [Eqs. (632) - (650)] with N >> 1 and sn = 0 describes the spin-independent (non-quantum) \"electrostatic-like\"\nand \"magnetostatic-like\" weak-interaction fields and weak interactions that correspond to the case of the Lorentzlike (non-quantum) spin-independent interaction. In other words, such a model corresponds to the non-quantum\ninteractions of the \"electrostatics\" and \"magnetostatics\" of the weakly interacting unit-fields (particles). Among the\nweakly interacting unit-fields (particles) with the intrinsic magnetic quantum numbers sn = \u22121, 0, 1 of the unitfield spin, the only unit-field (particles) with the spin numbers sn \u2261 mn = 0 demonstrate the \"spin-independent\"\n[E12,21 (R, s1 , s2 ) = E12,21 (R)] Lorentz-like behavior that satisfy the attractive (Al1 s1 = \u2212Al2 s2 ) and repulsive (Al1 s1 =\nAl2 s2 ) \"electrostatic-like\" weak interactions FC\nW 12 and the attractive (Al1 s1 = Al2 s2 , k01 = k02 or Al1 s1 = \u2212Al2 s2 ,\nk01 = \u2212k02 ) and repulsive (Al1 s1 = Al2 s2 , k01 = \u2212k02 or Al1 s1 = \u2212Al2 s2 , k01 = k02 ) \"magnetostatic-like\" interactions\nFM\nW 12 of the weakly interacting unit-fields (particles). The purely attractive spin-independent (Lorentz-like) \"nonM\nquantum\" interaction FC\nW 12 +FW 12 of the unit-field (particles) with the weak-interaction ACs having the spin numbers\nsn = 0, amplitudes Al1 = \u2212Al2 and momentums k01 = \u2212k02 could be considered as the \"non-quantum\" attraction\nof weakly interacting unit-fields [boson-like (Al1 = \u2212Al2 , k01 = \u2212k02 ) particles] that explains microscopically the\nBose-Einstein condensation and statistics of such particles. Although the \"spin-less\" (sn = 0) weakly interacting\nunit-fields (particles) have not been yet detected, the model [Eqs. (632) - (650)] is good for the (Coulomb-like and\nLorentz-like) description of the weak-interaction forces. The spin-dependent (quantum) interaction between the weakly\ninteracting unit-fields, which is observed experimentally, is described by the Lorentz-like spin-dependent (quantum)\ninteraction energy E12,21 (R, s1 , s2 ) determining by Eqs. (354), (355), (632) - (650) with the spin numbers (s1 = 1,\ns2 = 1), (s1 = \u22121, s2 = \u22121), (s1 = 1, s2 = \u22121) or (s1 = \u22121, s2 = 1). In other words, Eqs. (354), (355), (632) (650) determine the interaction properties of the weakly interacting unit-field (particle) and their connections with\nthe unit-field spin. A simple analysis of Eqs. (354), (355), (632) - (650) for the two unit-fields with the amplitudes\nAl1 s1 = Al2 s2 shows that the equations describe the repulsive (s1 = s2 , Al1 s1 = Al2 s2 , k01 = k02 ) and attractive\n(s1 6= s2 , Al1 s1 = Al2 s2 , k01 = k02 ) quantum forces associated with the Lorentz-like spin-dependent (quantum) energy\nof the weakly interacting fermion-like unit-fields (fermions). The Pauli exclusion principle states that no two identical\n(s1 = s2 , Al1 s1 = Al2 s2 , k01 = k02 ) fermions may occupy the same quantum state simultaneously. The spin-dependent\n(quantum) repulsive or attractive weak-interaction of the unit-fields (fermions) with the amplitudes Al1 s1 = Al2 s2\nhaving respectively the same (s1 = s2 ) or different (s1 6= s2 ) spin numbers could be considered as the physical\norigin explaining microscopically the Pauli exclusion principle and the Fermi-Dirac statistics of the weakly interacting\nfermions, which in canonical quantum mechanics and SM have nature of the unexplained postulates. Unlike in the\ntraditional quantum field theory and SM, which consider rather the fields of operators than the fields of particles, Eqs.\n(354), (355), (632) - (650) determine the \"electromagnetic-like\" properties of the weakly interacting unit-field (particle)\nand their connections with the unit-field spin naturally, without introduction of any pure mathematical object, like\nthe spin matrix or operators. It should be also noted that in the case of the two weakly interacting, normal unit-fields\n(particles) having the spin numbers s1 = s2 = \u00b11 and amplitudes Al1 s1 = \u2212Al2 s2 , the unit-fields (particles) can\nannihilate. Indeed, the weakly interacting unit-fields are the solutions of the equations of motions of the present\nmodel for both the A1sn and \u2212A1sn amplitudes. The Helmholtz-AC amplitude A1n sn can be an arbitrary constant\n[see, Eq. (508)]. The two weakly interacting unit-fields with s1 = s2 can satisfy the annihilation condition in the case\nA1s1 = \u2212A1s2 . In Eqs. (632) - (650), the unit-field (particle) with the positive value of A1s1 could be considered as\na normal unit-field (particle), while the unit-field (particle) with the negative value of A1m2 could be considered as\nan anti-unitfield (anti-particle). The annihilation of the two weakly interacting unit-fields with s1 = s2 = 0 does not\nrequire adjustments of the unit-field spins. The easy annihilation of the weakly interacting unit-fields with sn = 0, if\nthey really have been created under the cosmological Big Bang, could be considered as a physical mechanism of the\nabsence of such unit-fields (particles) in the present Universe. It should be noted again that Eqs. (632) - (650) are\nvalid in the particular case of the de Broglie generators \u03c8\u030301 (r, t) = a0 ei(k01 r\u2212\u03b501 t) (566) and \u03c8\u030302 (r, t) = a0 ei(k02 r\u2212\u03b502 t)\n(567). If the unit-field generators are not the de Broglie time-harmonic plane-waves, then the pure-weak interaction\nof the unit-fields (particles) are determined rather by the general equations (546) - (556) than the particular equations\n(632) - (650). One can easily follow the present model for any hypothetical unit-field (particle) with the spherically\nsymmetric Helmholtz-ACs associated with the spherical Bessel functions (510) of the second kind, if such elementary\nparticles exist somewhere in the Universe. In such a case, the spherically symmetric Helmholtz-ACs associated with\nthe spherical Bessel functions (510) of the second kind should have the finite external radius.\n2. The non-quantum and quantum pure-strong interactions of the unit-fields (particles)\nAn analysis of the unit-fields (particles) (538) and (539) having the de Broglie generators (566) and (567) and\nthe spherically symmetric Helmholtz-ACs associated with the modified spherical Bessel functions of the first (509)\nor second (511) kind, which is quite similar to the above-presented analysis of the weakly interacting unit-fields,\nshows that only the one-component unit-fields (538) related to the modified spherical Bessel functions (509) of the\n\n\f135\nfirst kind with the imaginary (\u0393aIn r = i|\u0393Sn |r) argument and the quantum numbers (ln = 0, sn = 0) or (ln = 1,\nsn = \u22121, 0, 1) may be considered as candidates for the pure-strong interactions of the unit-fields (particles) with the\nshort-range interaction energy. Furthermore, the only one-component unit-fields with the quantum numbers ln = 1\nand sn = \u00b11 obey the experimentally observed physical properties of the pure-strong interaction. In the case of the\nfirst Helmholtz-AC [\u03c6i1 = \u03c6S1 (r)] centered at the origin and the second Helmholtz-AC [\u03c6i2 = \u03c6W 2 (r \u2212 R)] located\nat the distance R = |R| \u2261 |R12 | in the azimuthal direction, the relativistic interaction (cross-correlation) total term\n(571) has the form\n#\n\"\nZ\nZ\nZ \u221e\nE12,21 (R, l1 , l2 , s1 , s2 ) = k01 k02 Al1 s1 Al2 s2 a20\n+ [m01 m02 \u2212 |\u0393S1 ||\u0393S2 |]\n\n\u03c0\n\n2\u03c0\n\nd\u03b8sin\u03b8\n\n\u03b8=0\n\n\"\n\nAl1 s1 Al2 s2 a20\n\nZ\n\nr2 drjl1 (i|\u0393S1 |r)jl2 (i|\u0393S2 ||r \u2212 R|)f +\n\nd\u03c6\n\n\u03c6=0\n\n\u03c0\n\nd\u03b8sin\u03b8\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n2\u03c0\n\nd\u03c6\n\n0\n\n\u03c6=0\n\n\u03b8=0\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\n#\n\n2\n\nr drjl1 (i|\u0393S1 |r)jl2 (i|\u0393S2 ||r \u2212 R|)f , (651)\n\nwhere\n\u0393ai1 = i|\u0393S1 | = i|\u0393S2 | 6= 0\nl1 = l2 = 1.\n\n(652)\n\nHere, the angle factor f = f (r, R, \u03b8, \u03c6, l1 , l2 , s1 , s2 ) associated with the spherical harmonics is given by\n\u2217\n\n\u2217\n\nf (r, R, \u03b8, \u03c6, l1 , l2 , s1 , s2 ) = Yls11 (\u03b8, \u03c6)Yls22 (\u03b8, \u03c62 ) + Yls11 (\u03b8, \u03c6)Yls22 (\u03b8, \u03c62 ),\n\n(653)\n\nwhere the intrinsic \"magnetic\" quantum numbers are given by s1 = \u22121, 0, 1 and s2 = \u22121, 0, 1, and \u03c62 = \u03c62 (r, R, \u03c6)\ndenotes the azimuthal angle associated with the vector r \u2212 R in the spherical coordinate system of the second\nHelmholtz-AC. Notice, a simple analysis also shows that Eqs. (572) - (574) derived by using the non-relativistic\n(Newton) approximation of the unit-field (particle) energy do not describe correctly the strong interaction of unitfields (particles). That means that the strongly interacting unit-fields (elementary particles) are relativistic objects\ndescribing rather by the Einstein particle energy than by the Newton particle energy. The relativistic interaction\n(cross-correlation) total term E12,21 (R, l1 , l2 , s1 , s2 ) = 0 if the intrinsic orbital quantum numbers l1 6= l2 . That is to\nsay that the two one-component unit-fields having the different intrinsic orbital quantum numbers do not interact\nstrongly with each other. In order to exclude the singularities in the self-correlation energy (410) and the crosscorrelation energy (651) associated with the points r = 0 and r \u2212 R = 0, one should suppose that the strongly\ninteracting Helmholtz-ACs \u03c6S1 (r) and \u03c6S2 (r \u2212 R) are hollow around these points in the bolls of the radius r0S . A\nS\nsimple analysis shows that the infinite upper integration limit (rup\n= \u221e) in Eq. (632) does not compare well with\nS\nthe finite fields and energies of the strong interaction. The case of rup = \u221e corresponds to the infinite Helmholtz-ACs\nwith infinite strong-interaction energies. In order to satisfy the finite fields and energies of the strong interaction,\none should suppose that the unit-field Helmholtz-AC of the strongly interacting unit-field is limited by the upper\nS\nboundary (integration limit) of the radius rup\n< \u221e. That means that the unit-field Helmholtz-AC vanishes above the\nAC upper boundary.

(509)]. If the n-th strongly\ninteracting unit-field (particle) has the \"colar charge\" Qc0n , which is different from the electric (Coulomb) charge,\nthen the amplitude A1n sn in Eq. (655) could be presented in the form A1n sn (Qc0n /m0n ) that corresponds to the\n\"electric-like\" (\"electromagnetic-like\") weak interaction mediating by the \"hyper charges\" Qc0n [for the comparison,\nsee Eqs. (616) and (637)] . The Helmholtz-AC amplitudes color charges of the unit-fields (particles) should be\nadjusted to the values corresponding to the experimentally observed parameters of the strong interaction. Unlike in\nthe conventional quantum field theories, the Helmholtz-AC amplitude associated with the hyper (color) charge of the\n\n\f136\nstrongly-interacting unit-field (particle) gives the physical (non-phenomenological) explanation of the color charge.\nThe parameters\nr = r0S\n\n(656)\n\nS\nr = rup\n\n(657)\n\nand\n\ncould be considered respectively as the particle classical dimension and the external radius of a strongly interacting\nunit-field.

The \"strong strength\" of the strongly interacting unit-field is attributed to the properties\nof the strong-interaction geometrical factor (655), while the short-range of the strong interaction is associated with\nS\nthe external radius rup\nof the Helmholtz-AC. Thus the parameter r0S could be interpreted as the classical radius of\nS\nthe particle, while rup as the external dimension of the unit-field determining the short range of weak interactions\nHelmholtz-AC.\nThe weak-relativistic (E12,21 << \u03b5201 + \u03b5202 ) interaction forces (354) and (355) acting upon the first and second\nunit-fields (particles) have respectively the forms\n1 \u2202\nE12,21 (R, l1 , l2 , s1 , s2 )\n2 \u2202R\n\n(664)\n\n1 \u2202\nE12,21 (R, l1 , l2 , s1 , s2 ).\n2 \u2202R\n\n(665)\n\nF12 (R) = \u2212\nand\nF21 (R) =\n\nAnalysis of Eqs.

The dimensions r0S 6= 0 and rup\n6= \u221e should be\nadjusted to the values, which are in agreement with the physical properties of the strong interactions. The parameters\nS\nr0S and rup\ncould be interpreted as the internal and internal dimensions of the unit-field having the strong-interaction\nHelmholtz-AC. The strong-interaction energy and force do increase exponentially with the increase of the distance\nS\nR between the strongly interacting unit-fields (particles) and approaches the zero value at the distance R > 2rup\n.\nIndeed, the volume of interaction associated with the two overlapping Helmholtz-ACs slowly decreases with increasing\nthe distance R, while the energy of the interaction (cross-correlation) of the Helmholtz-ACs increases exponentially.\nS\nOn the short distance (R << rup\n), the strong force could hold the strongly interacting unit-fields (particles) together\nS\nto form the composite field (hadron). On the longer distance (R \u223c rup\n), the volume of interaction (cross-correlation)\nassociated with the two overlapping Helmholtz-ACs has the string-like shape. In other words, the lines of strong force\ncould collimate into strings in such a case. In this way, the present model not only explains in microscopical details how\nthe strongly interacting unit-fields (particles) interact over short distances, but also the string-like behavior, which\nthe virtual unit-fields (particles) manifest over longer distances. In the quantum field theories and SM, the color\nconfinement is the physics phenomenon that color charged particles (such as quarks) cannot be isolated singularly,\nand therefore cannot be directly observed. In the present model, the above-considered unit-fields (particles) having\nthe color charges do interact with each other by means of the strong force, whose value exponentially increases\nwith the increase of distance between the unit-fields (particles). That gives the microscopic explanation of the color\nconfinement phenomenon.\nThe strong interaction between the two unit-fields determining by Eqs. (651) - (665) may be interpreted not only\nby using the \"electric-like\" and \"magnetic-like\" strong interaction fields and potentials, which are somewhat similar\nto the respective Eqs. (597) - (603), but also in the terms of the virtual particles. The relativistic energy of the\ncomposite field (particle) composed from the strongly interacting unit-fields (particles) is given by Eq. (381) as\n\u03b52 = \u03b5201 + \u03b5202 + E12 + E21 = \u03b5201 + \u03b5202 + E12,21 .\n\n(666)\n\nThe energies squared \u03b5201 and \u03b5202 could be attributed to the \"moving\" and \"non-moving\" masses of the 1st and\n2nd relativistic normal unit-fields (elementary particles). The strong-interaction cross-correlation terms E12 =\nE12 (m01 , \u0393S1 ; m02 , \u0393S2 ) and E21 = E21 (m02 , \u0393S2 ; m01 , \u0393S1 ) could be attributed to the \"moving\" and \"non-moving\"\nmasses m01 , m02 , \u0393S1 and \u0393S2 of the 1st and 2nd relativistic normal unit-fields. The strong-interaction crosscorrelation terms E12 and E21 associated with the masses m01 , m02 , \u0393S1 and \u0393S2 and the strong interactions may\n\n\f138\nbe considered as the interplay of the 3rd and 4th virtual relativistic unit-fields (elementary particles) attributed to\nthe relativistic strong interaction of the 1st and 2nd normal massive unit-fields (elementary particles). Thus the relativistic strong-interaction between the two normal relativistic unit-fields (elementary particles) could be considered\n(interpreted) as the interplay of the four unit-fields (particles), where the composite field (particle) is composed from\nthe 1st and 2nd normal unit-fields (particles) and the 3rd and 4th virtual unit-fields (particles). For more details\nof the interpretation based on the use of virtual particles see the comments to Eq. (381). The virtual relativistic\nunit-fields (elementary particles), which carry the strong force and energy, logically to call the virtual gluons induced\nby the color charges of the 1st and 2nd normal unit-fields (particles). The name gluon corresponds to the carrier\nof the strong interaction in the quantum field theories and SM. The strongly interacting normal unit-field (particle)\nwith the mass m0n obey the relations m0n << \u0393Sn . In such a case the strong-interaction cross-correlation terms\nare given by E12 (m01 , \u0393S1 ; m02 , \u0393S2 ) = E12 (\u0393S1 , \u0393S2 ) and E21 (m02 , \u0393S2 ; m01 , \u0393S1 ) = E21 (\u0393S2 , \u0393S1 ), where the values\n\u0393S1 and \u0393S2 could be interpreted as the gauge masses of the virtual gluons associated with the 1st and 2nd strongly\ninteracting normal unit-fields (particles). The parameter \u0393W n 6= 0 could be attributed to the mass of the strongly\ninteracting particles even in the case of the unit-fields (particles) that obey the zero rest-mass m0 = 0 [see, Eq. (483)].\nIn the frame of the Heisenberg energy uncertainty relation and the perturbation approximation, the short range of the\nstrong interaction is attributed phenomenologically (formally) by the quantum field theories and SM to the heaviness\nof the virtual gluons. The present model gives the microscopic explanation of the phenomenon. The short-range\nS\nof the strong interaction is attributed to the finite external radius rup\nof the heavy Helmholtz-AC of the strongly\ninteracting unit-field (particle). In the terms of the virtual particles (gluons) of the present model, the strong force is\nassumed to be mediated by gluons, acting upon the strongly interacting unit-fields (particles). On the short distance,\nthe strong force holds the strongly interacting unit-fields (particles) to form the composite field (particle). The lines\nof strong force of the gluons interacting with each other at long distances collimate into strings. In this way, the\nphysical interpretation of the phenomena is similar to the traditional quantum field theories and SM.\nSince the energy squared of the n-th unit-field is positive (\u03b520n \u2265 0), the unit-fields\n(particles) with\u0003 the parameters\n\u0002\n\u0393Sn = i|\u0393Sn | under the condition |\u0393Sn | \u2265 m0 could exist only as the moving ( k20n + (m20 \u2212 |\u0393Sn |2 ) > 0) unit-fields\n(particles). The model [Eqs. (651) - (666)] describes interaction of the two (N = 2) strongly interacting unit-fields\n(particles) with the moments k01 = k02 = k0 . One can easily follow the model for an arbitrary number N of\nthe weakly interacting unit-fields (particles) having the de Broglie generators \u03c8\u03030n (r, t) = a0 ei(k0n r\u2212\u03b50n t) with the\nmoments k0n = \u00b1k0 . The model [Eqs. (651) - (666)] with N >> 1 and sn = 0 describes the spin-independent\n(non-quantum) \"electrostatic-like\" and \"magnetostatic-like\" strong-interaction fields and strong interactions that\ncorrespond to the case of the Lorentz-like (non-quantum) spin-independent interaction. In other words, such a model\ncorresponds to the non-quantum interactions of the \"electrostatics\" and \"magnetostatics\" of the strongly interacting\nunit-fields (particles). Among the strongly interacting unit-fields (particles) with the intrinsic magnetic quantum\nnumbers sn = \u22121, 0, 1 of the unit-field spin, the only unit-field (particles) with the spin numbers sn \u2261 mn = 0\ndemonstrate the \"spin-independent\" [E12,21 (R, s1 , s2 ) = E12,21 (R)] Lorentz-like behavior that satisfy the attractive\n(Al1 s1 = \u2212Al2 s2 ) and repulsive (Al1 s1 = Al2 s2 ) \"electrostatic-like\" strong interactions FC\nW 12 and the attractive\n(Al1 s1 = Al2 s2 , k01 = k02 or Al1 s1 = \u2212Al2 s2 , k01 = \u2212k02 ) and repulsive (Al1 s1 = Al2 s2 , k01 = \u2212k02 or Al1 s1 = \u2212Al2 s2 ,\nk01 = k02 ) \"magnetostatic-like\" interactions FM\nW 12 of the strongly interacting unit-fields (particles). The purely\nM\nattractive spin-independent (Lorentz-like) \"non-quantum\" interaction FC\nW 12 + FW 12 of the unit-field (particles) with\nthe strong-interaction ACs having the spin numbers sn = 0, amplitudes Al1 = \u2212Al2 and momentums k01 = \u2212k02\ncould be considered as the \"non-quantum\" attraction of strongly interacting unit-fields [boson-like (Al1 = \u2212Al2 ,\nk01 = \u2212k02 ) particles] that explains microscopically the Bose-Einstein condensation and statistics of such particles.\nAlthough the \"spin-less\" (sn = 0) strongly interacting unit-fields (particles) have not been yet detected, the model\n[Eqs. (651) - (666)] is good for the (Coulomb-like and Lorentz-like) description of the strong-interaction forces.The\nspin-dependent (quantum) interaction between the strongly interacting unit-fields, which is observed experimentally, is\ndescribed by the Lorentz-like spin-dependent (quantum) interaction energy E12,21 (R, s1 , s2 ) determining by Eqs. (354),\n(355), (651) - (666) with the spin numbers (s1 = 1, s2 = 1), (s1 = \u22121, s2 = \u22121), (s1 = 1, s2 = \u22121) or (s1 = \u22121,\ns2 = 1). In other words, Eqs. (354), (355), (651) - (666) determine the interaction properties of the strongly\ninteracting unit-field (particle) and their connections with the unit-field spin. A simple analysis of Eqs. (354), (355),\n(651) - (666) for the two unit-fields with the amplitudes Al1 s1 = Al2 s2 shows that the equations describe the repulsive\n(s1 = s2 , Al1 s1 = Al2 s2 , k01 = k02 ) and attractive (s1 6= s2 , Al1 s1 = Al2 s2 , k01 = k02 ) quantum forces associated with\nthe Lorentz-like spin-dependent (quantum) energy of the strongly interacting fermion-like unit-fields (fermions). The\nPauli exclusion principle states that no two identical (s1 = s2 , Al1 s1 = Al2 s2 , k01 = k02 ) fermions may occupy the\nsame quantum state simultaneously. The spin-dependent (quantum) repulsive or attractive strong-interaction of the\nunit-fields (fermions) with the amplitudes Al1 s1 = Al2 s2 having respectively the same (s1 = s2 ) or different (s1 6= s2 )\nspin numbers could be considered as the physical origin explaining microscopically the Pauli exclusion principle and\n\n\f139\nthe Fermi-Dirac statistics of the strongly interacting fermions, which in canonical quantum mechanics and SM have\nnature of the unexplained postulates. Unlike in the traditional quantum field theory and SM, which consider rather the\nfields of operators than the fields of particles, Eqs. (354), (355), (651) - (666) determine the \"electromagnetic-like\"\nproperties of the strongly interacting unit-field (particle) and their connections with the unit-field spin naturally,\nwithout introduction of any pure mathematical object, like the spin matrix or operators. It should be also noted\nthat in the case of the two strongly interacting, normal unit-fields (particles) having the spin numbers s1 = s2 = \u00b11\nand amplitudes Al1 s1 = \u2212Al2 s2 , the unit-fields (particles) can annihilate. Indeed, the strongly interacting unit-fields\nare the solutions of the equations of motions of the present model for both the A1sn and \u2212A1sn amplitudes. The\nHelmholtz-AC amplitude A1n sn can be an arbitrary constant [see, Eq. (509)]. The two strongly interacting unit-fields\nwith s1 = s2 can satisfy the annihilation condition in the case A1s1 = \u2212A1s2 . In Eqs. (651) - (666), the unit-field\n(particle) with the positive value of A1s1 could be considered as a normal unit-field (particle), while the unit-field\n(particle) with the negative value of A1m2 could be considered as an anti-unitfield (anti-particle). The annihilation\nof the two strongly interacting unit-fields with s1 = s2 = 0 does not require adjustments of the unit-field spins.\nThe easy annihilation of the strongly interacting unit-fields with sn = 0, if they really have been created under the\ncosmological Big Bang, could be considered as a physical mechanism of the absence of such unit-fields (particles) in the\npresent Universe. It should be stressed again that Eqs. (651) - (666) are valid in the particular case of the de Broglie\ngenerators \u03c8\u030301 (r, t) = a0 ei(k01 r\u2212\u03b501 t) (566) and \u03c8\u030302 (r, t) = a0 ei(k02 r\u2212\u03b502 t) (567). If the unit-field generators are not the\nde Broglie plane-waves, then the pure-strong interaction of the unit-fields (particles) are determined rather by Eqs.\n(546) - (556) than Eqs. (651) - (666). The above-presented model may be easily reformulated for any hypothetical\nunit-field (particle) with the spherically symmetric Helmholtz-ACs associated with the spherical Bessel functions (511)\nof the second kind, if such elementary particles exist somewhere in the Universe. Notice, the spherically symmetric\nHelmholtz-ACs associated with the spherical Bessel functions (511) of the second kind should have the finite external\nradius.\n7.4.

All other\nparticles are made from these elementary particles. Quarks (up, down, charm, strange, top, bottom) and Leptons\n(electron neutrino, electron, muon neutrino, muon, tau neutrino, tau) and the respective anti-quarks and anti-leptons\nare fermions. If the particles have electric charges, weak isospins, weak hypercharges and color charges, then they\ninteract with each other electromagnetically, weakly and strongly by exchanging the respective gauge virtual particles.\nThe gauge virtual particles (photons, W -bosons, Z-bosons, gluons and Higgs particles) are bosons. If the bosons\nhave the weak isospins or weak hypercharges, then they demonstrate the weak interactions between each other.\nThe particles and interaction of SM are summarized in Tab. II. In the present section (Sec. 7.4), the unit-fields\nhaving the de Broglie generators \u03c8\u03030n and the different TACs containing the spherically symmetric, Laplace-ACs\nand Helmholtz-ACs \u03c6in obeying the different combinations of the gravitational, electromagnetic, weak and strong\ninteractions are identified as the elementary particles, namely the gravitons (mass-less), photons (mass-less), quarks\n(massive), anti-quarks (massive), leptons (massive), anti-leptons (massive), W-bosons (massive), Z-bosons (massive)\nand gluons (massive) as follows.\n1. The mass-less unit-fields corresponding to the non-virtual gravitons. Gravitational interaction of gravitons with\neach other. The gravitational interaction of massive unit-fields with each other by the virtual exchange of the mass-less\nunit-fields (gravitons) or the curving of space by the massive unit-fields (particles)\nIn Sec. 7.2., the massive gravitationally interacting unit-fields having the de Broglie generators \u03c8\u03030n , which do not\ncarry electric charges, weak isospins, weak hypercharges and color charges have been attributed to the one-component\nunit-fields with the one-component TACs containing the spherically symmetric gravitational Laplace-ACs \u03c6Gn . The\nmass-less one-component unit-fields corresponding to the non-virtual or virtual gravitons are different from the massive\ngravitationally interacting unit-fields. The mass-less unit-fields, which do not have the rest masses, electric charges,\nweak isospins, weak hypercharges and color charges, are the simplest unit-fields. The non-virtual, one-component,\ngravitational unit-fields (non-virtual gravitons) \u03c80n (r, t) = \u03c8\u03030n (r, t)\u03c6Gn (r, t) are described by Eq.

In contrast to the massive gravitationally interacting unit-fields (particles),\nwhich obey the time-independent ACs (\u03c6\u0307Gn = 0), the non-virtual, mass-less, one-component gravitational unit-fields\n(non-virtual gravitons) have the time-dependent ACs (\u03c6\u0307Gn 6= 0).

An analysis of Eqs. (672) - (676) predicts\nthe bunching and anti-bunching of gravitons as well as the Bose-Einstein condensation of such unit-fields (particles).\nNotice, the similar coherent phenomena are known in the traditional quantum electrodynamics describing the other\nmass-less particles, namely the photons.\nThe relativistic gravitational interaction (interference) between the massive unit-fields (particles) separated by\nthe distance R, which is governed by the relativistic gravitational interaction (cross-correlation) term (583), can be\nconsidered as the virtual exchange of the above-described gravitons. In other words, the gravitational interaction\nmay be reinterpreted as the exchange of virtual gravitons at the every time moment t. For instance, in the case\nof the two one-component unit-fields \u03c801 (r, t) = \u03c8\u030301 (r, t)\u03c6G1 (r, t) and \u03c802 (r, t) = \u03c8\u030302 (r, t)\u03c6G2 (r, t) interacting only\ngravitationally, the relativistic gravitational interaction (cross-correlation) total term (568) - (571), (583) has the form\nE12,21 (R, s1 , s2 ) = k01 k02 fG + m01 m02 fG ,\n\n(677)\n\nwhere the gravitational geometrical factor fG determining by Eq.

In such a case, the interaction could be reinterpreted as\nthe virtual exchange of real gravitons or simply as the exchange of virtual gravitons. The present model of the\ninterference (interaction) of the unit-fields, which are not the point particles, does not really require the introduction\nof the virtual point-particles because such a reinterpretation does not give new inside the mechanism of gravitational\ninteractions. Nevertheless, the use of the virtual unit-fields (gravitons) provides a background for comparison of the\npresent model with the traditional quantum field theories, where the point-particles separated by the vacuum may\ninteract with each other only by the exchange of virtual particles. In the terms of the Einstein general relativity,\nthe gravitational interaction determining by Eqs. (677) and (678) may be reinterpreted as the consequence of the\ncurving space by the massive unit-fields (particles). Indeed, the gravitational geometrical factor fG (R, s1 , s2 ) = const.\ncould be attributed to the \"non-curved\" space with the freely moving particles, while the gravitational geometrical\nfactor fG (R, s1 , s2 ) 6= const. could describe the gravitationally interacting unit-fields (particles). In the present model\nof the gravitational interaction of massive unit-fields, the virtual exchange of the mass-less unit-fields (gravitons) is\nequivalent to the curving of space by the massive unit-fields (particles). Also note the particles (gravitons) with the\nnegative values of the unit-field amplitudes have been attributed in Sec. 7.2. to the ant-particles (anti-gravitons).\n2. The mass-less unit-fields corresponding to the non-virtual photons. Electromagnetic interaction of photons with\neach other. The electromagnetic interaction of massive electrically charged unit-fields with each other by the virtual\nexchange of the mass-less unit-fields (photons)\nThe description of the mass-less unit-fields corresponding to the non-virtual and virtual photons is quite similar\nto the above-presented model of gravitons. Although the gravitons and photons have the unit-field amplitudes of\ndifferent natures, the equations describing the photons are indistinguishable from the respective equations describing\nthe gravitons. Indeed, the massive electromagnetically interacting unit-fields having the de Broglie generators \u03c8\u03030n ,\nwhich do carry masses and electric charges but do not have weak isospins, weak hypercharges and color charges,\nhave been considered in Sec. 7.2. as the one-component unit-fields with the one-component TACs containing the\nspherically symmetric electrical Laplace-ACs \u03c6Cn . The mass-less one-component unit-fields corresponding to the\nnon-virtual or virtual photons are different from the massive electromagnetically interacting unit-fields. The massless unit-fields, which do not have the rest masses, electric charges, weak isospins, weak hypercharges and color\ncharges, are the simplest unit-fields. The non-virtual, one-component, electromagnetic unit-fields (non-virtual photons)\n\n\f142\n\u03c80n (r, t) = \u03c8\u03030n (r, t)\u03c6Cn (r, t) are described by Eq. (400) with the rest mass m0 = 0 and the index I = C, which has\nthe form\n\u03c6Cn \u0003\u03c8\u03030n + \u03c8\u03030n \u0003\u03c6Cn = 0.\n\n(679)\n\nThe solutions of Eq. (679) are the non-virtual photons\n\u03c80n (r, t) = a0n ei(k0n r\u2212\u03b50n t+\u03b1n ) ,\n\n(680)\n\nwhich have the structure-less form (235) of the the time-harmonic plane waves with the de Broglie generators\n\u221a\n\u03c8\u03030n (r, t) = a0n ei(k0n r\u2212\u03b50n t+\u03b1n )/2\n(681)\nand the de Broglie associate-components\n\u03c6Cn (r, t) =\n\n\u221a\na0n ei(k0n r\u2212\u03b50n t+\u03b1n )/2\n\n(682)\n\nthat are indistinguishable from each other. Notice, that Eqs. (680) - (682) describing the photons are indistinguishable from Eqs. (668) - (670) describing the gravitons. In contrast to the massive electromagnetically interacting\nunit-fields (particles), which obey the time-independent ACs (\u03c6\u0307Cn = 0), the non-virtual, mass-less, one-component\nelectromagnetic unit-fields (non-virtual photons) have the time-dependent ACs (\u03c6\u0307Cn 6= 0).

The virtual photons and gravitons are the mass-less particles associated with the gauge masses \u0393G = \u0393EM = 0,\nwhile the gauge masses of the W and Z bosons are associated with the eigen-parameters \u0393W 6= 0 and \u0393S 6= 0.\nThe relativistic interaction (cross-correlation) total term (698) mediates the superposition of the Lorentz-like gravitational [(589), (590)], electromagnetic [(617), (618)], weak [(645), (646)] and strong [(664), (665)] interactions (forces\nF12 (R) = \u2212F21 (R)) (see, Sec. 7.3.) between the quarks (up, down, charm, strange, top and bottom) carrying the\nmasses, electric charges, weak isospins, weak hypercharges and color charges. Also note the particles (quarks) with the\nnegative values of the unit-field amplitudes have been attributed in Sec. 7.3. to the ant-particles (antiquarks). The\ncomparison of the gravitational (fG ), electromagnetic (fEM ), weak (fW ) and strong (fS ) geometric factors presents a\nphysical explanation why the field strength of the strong interaction is a few orders of magnitude higher than that of\nthe weak force, electromagnetism and gravitation.

THE PARTICLES, INTERACTIONS AND FORCES ACCORDING TO THE PRESENT MODEL\nUNIFYING THE ALL-KNOWN ELEMENTARY PARTICLES AND INTERACTIONS\n\nUnification of the all-known particles, interactions and forces by the present model is summarized in Tab. III. The\npresent model considers an elementary particle as a material unit-field of mass-energy. The unified interaction between\nunit-fields (particles) is considered to be mediated by the cross-correlation energy connected with the interference\nbetween the unit-fields. The unified force between unit-fields (particles) is attributed to the gradient of the crosscorrelation energy. A unit-field \u03c80n obeys the internal structure associated with the generator \u03c8\u03030n and the total\nassociate-component \u03a6an of the unit-field, \u03c80n = \u03c8\u03030n \u03a6an . In other words, the unit-fields are distinguished from each\nother by the generators \u03c8\u03030n and the total associate-components \u03a6an . The free unit-fields with different generators\nhave the different values of the unit-field momentum. The differences in the associate components yields the different\nmasses, electric charges, weak isospins, weak hypercharges and color charges of the unit-fields. That leads to the\ndifferences in the interactions and forces between the unit-fields (particles). The Gravitational Force is mediated by\nthe interference of massive unit-fields, which may be reinterpreted as the exchange of virtual gravitons (hypothetical\nmass-less particles) or as the relativistic curving of empty space by the massive particles.\nIf the unit-field generators have the configuration of the de Broglie time-harmonic plane-waves, then the gravitational, electromagnetic, weak and strong interactions of the unit-fields (particles) are described by Eqs. (566) - (702).\n\n\f146\nThe unified model of elementary particles and interactions\nElementary particles \u2261 Unit-fields\nMatter: Quarks and Leptons\nAntimatter: Antiquarks and antileptons\nCarriers of forces: Gravitons (Curved Space), Photons, W-bosons and Z-bosons, Gluons\nComposite particles: Hadrons (Mesons and Barions), nuclei, atoms and molecules\nInteraction \u2261 Interference (cross-correlation)\nGravitational Force by interference of massive unit-fields\n\nForce carriers: Gravitons\n\nElectromagnetic Force by interference of electrically charged unit-fields\n\nForce carriers: Photons\n\nWeak Force by interference of unit-fields having isospins and hypercharges\n\nForce carriers: W- and Z-Bosons\n\nStrong Force by interference of unit-fields having color charges\n\nForce carriers: Gluons\n\nTABLE III: The particles and interactions according to the present model, which unifies the all-known particles and interactions.\nSimilarly to the some non-standard, candidate theories (Grand Unified Theories and Theories of Everything), the present model\ndo contain the Gravitational Force by considering the interference of massive unit-fields, which may be reinterpreted as the\nexchange of virtual gravitons (hypothetical mass-less particles) or as the curving of space by the massive particles.\n\nThe behavior of unit-fields (elementary particles) having the arbitrary generators \u03c8\u03030n and the multi-component TACs\n\u03a6a1 with the calibrations (gauges) (469), (470) and (473) is described by Eqs. (546) - (556) of Sec. 6. In the most\ngeneral case, one should use the all above-presented equations without the calibrations (gauges) (469), (470) and (473).\nFor an example, the system of motion equations\nN\nX\n\nn=1\n\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u03a6an \u0003\u03c8\u03030n + m20 \u03c8\u03030n + \u03c8\u03030n (\u03a6an )\u22121 \u22072 \u03a6an = 0\n\n(703)\n\ndescribing the interfering (interacting) unit-fields (particles) under the calibrations (gauges) (469), (470) and (473),\nin the most general case [see, Eq. (400)] has the general form of the N coupled equations\nN\nX\n\nn=1\n\n \u0307\n\u03a6an (\u0003\u03c8\u03030n + m20 \u03c8\u03030n ) + \u03c8\u03030n \u0003\u03a6an + 2\u03c8\u0303 0n \u03a6\u0307an \u2212 2\u2207\u03c8\u03030n \u2207\u03a6an = 0,\n\n(704)\n\nwhich is more complicated, but is suitable for the comparison of formulas of Part II based on the direct generalization\nof the Einstein energy-mass relation for a structured unit-field (particle) with the Standard Model of Particle Physics\n(SM) and/or with Part I based on the insertion of interference between particles into the traditional interaction-free\n(interference-free) Hamiltonians of the traditional quantum field theories. The detailed relations of the present model\nwith the Standard Model of Particle Physics will be illustrated in the following study. Notice, the transition from the\n\u2032\nstate describing by the unit-field generator \u03c8\u03030n to the state characterizing by the generator \u03c8\u03030n\ncould be described\nsimply by application of the perturbation theory to Eqs. (546) - (556) based on the calibrations (gauges) (469), (470)\nand (473) or to the above-presented equations that do not use these calibrations. In the present model, the transition\nfrom one kind of a unit-field (particles) to another is accompanied by the change (\"spontaneous or non-spontaneous\nbreaking\") of symmetry of the total associate component (TAC) of the unit-field (see, Secs. 7.2 and 7.3.). It should\nbe also noted that the total relativistic cross-correlation terms (684), (689), (691), (695) and (698) associated with the\nm-th and n-th unit-fields do depend on the phases \u03b1m and \u03b1n of the interfering (interacting) unit-fields (particles).\nIn the case of unit-fields (particles) having the probabilistic (for instance, thermal) distributions of the values kn ,\nkm , \u03b5n , \u03b5m , \u03b1n and \u03b1m in macroscopic bodies (macroscopic composite \"particles\"), the energies and total relativistic\ncross-correlation terms should be averaged using these probabilistic distributions. That is important for description\nof the well-known macroscopic coherent quantum phenomena, such as the Bose-Einstein condensation, superfluidity,\nsuperconductivity, supermagnetism, super-radiation, Bosenova effect, and quantum anomalous and fractional Hall\neffects. For the elementary particles of the present model, the macroscopic quantum phenomena will be presented in\nthe next study.\nIn conclusion, Part I of the present study has developed the theoretical background for a unified description of the\nclassical and quantum fields and interactions in terms of the interference between elementary particles (indivisible\n\n\f147\nunit-fields) and the respective cross-correlation energy, which do not exist from the point of view of the canonical\nquantum mechanics, quantum field theories, SM and string theories. The Hamiltonians that describe the crosscorrelation energy mediating by interference of the basic classical and quantum material fields composed from the\n3-dimensional (in space) unit-fields of physical matter (mass-energy) have been derived by the generalization of\nthe traditional Hamiltonians of the classical and quantum field theories for the superposition of interfering unitfields associated with the interacting particles. It has been shown that the gradient of the cross-correlation energy\ninduced by the interference between particles (unit-fields) mediates the attractive or repulsive forces, which could be\nattributed to all known classical and quantum fields (for details, see Part I). The present study (Part II) has used this\ntheoretical background for unified description of the fundamental (electromagnetic, weak, strong and gravitational)\nfields and interactions. However, unlike in Part I, the unification was performed rather by the generalization of the\nbasic (energy-mass) relation of the Einstein special relativity than the traditional Hamiltonians of the classical and\nquantum field theories. The model unified the all-known fields, particles and interactions by the straightforward\ngeneralization of the Einstein relativistic energy-mass relation \u03b52 = k2 + m2 for the interacting particles and bodies,\nwhich are composed from the interfering, indivisible unit-fields associated with the elementary particles. The unitfields have simultaneously properties of the point particles and waves of quantum mechanics (particle-wave duality),\nthe point particles of SM, the strings of theories of strings and the 3-D (in space) waves of theories of classical fields.\nTherefore the unification of the fundamental fields and interactions could be considered as the further development\nand generalization of the canonical quantum mechanics, classical and quantum field theories, SM and string theories.\n\n[1] M.

New Approach for Constructing a Unified Quantum Model of Gravitational and\nElectromagnetic Fields and Interactions\nS. V. Kukhlevsky\nDepartment of Physics, Faculty of Natural Sciences,\nUniversity of Pecs, Ifjusag u. 6, H-7624 Pecs, Hungary\nPart I of the present study has developed the theoretical background for unified description of the all-known\nclassical and quantum fields in terms of the interference between particles and the respective cross-correlation\nenergy, which do not exist from the point of view of quantum mechanics and SM. Part II developed this background\nfor unification of the electromagnetic, weak, strong and gravitational fields and interactions. However, unlike in\nPart I, the unification was performed rather by the generalization of the basic (energy-mass) relation of the Einstein\nspecial relativity than the traditional Hamiltonians of the classical and quantum field theories. Part III presents the\nnew approach for constructing a unified quantum model of gravitational and electromagnetic fields and interactions\nis presented. The approach is based on a concept of interfering (cross-correlating) material unit-fields. Starting\nfrom the Einstein mass-energy relation and using this concept, the quantum equation for united gravitation and\nelectromagnetism is derived. The unified equation yields all known solutions to the Dirac equation, for example,\nthe fine and hyperfine structure of the atom spectrum. Furthermore, the unified model suggests explanations of\nthe Pauli exclusion principle and the physical nature of spin and anomalous gyromagnetic factor of an electron.\nFor weak potentials, in the classical limit, the model simplifies to the Lorentz-Maxwell electromagnetism and the\nso-called gravitoelectromagnetic approximation of Einstein's general relativity. In case of the strong potentials,\nthe model yields new predictions. For instance, the cross-correlation of gravitational and electric strong potentials\npredicts the \"anti-gravity force\". The model suggests explanations also of \"dark matter\" and \"dark energy\".\n\n1. INTRODUCTION\n\nUnification of the Lorentz-Maxwell electromagnetism with the Einstein general relativity is a long-standing problem\nin physics. Today we know that the electromagnetism is part of a larger gauge group described by the Standard Model\nof Particle Physics (SM). Unfortunatelly, SM does not include gravity. The main difficulty in unification of the LorentzMaxwell and Einstein theories is the principal difference between the models. The model of material electromagnetic\nfields is based on the scalar and vector potentials mediated by electrical charges, whereas the geometrical framework\nof general relativity deals with gravitational fields attributed to the immaterial spacetime around massive particles.\nIn spite of the difference, there are many physical and mathematical connections between the two theories. The early\nstudies [1\u20133] have revealed the gravitational analogues to Maxwell's equations, called the \"gravitoelectromagnetic\nequations\". The study [4] has derived the Lorentz-like force law for a massive particle moving in gravitational field.\nIn 1916, A. Einstein noticed that the Maxwell equations can be formulated in a form independent of the metric\ngravitational potential [5]. This was followed by further important studies [6\u20139]. From a huge amount of early studies\none should mention the famous article [10] of A. Einstein and N. Rosen, which tried to extend the geometric framework\nof general relativity to also include electromagnetism. Despite the fact that the unification is challenging, a lot of\nother physical and mathematical connections between the two models were uncovered during the last 100 years, e.g.\nstring theory and quantum gravity (see, for instance, the modern reviews [11\u201313] and references therein). Analysis\nof the connections, especially the gravitational analogues to Maxwell's and Lorentz's equations [1\u20134], supports rather\nthe old idea that objects with mass attract each other through a material gravitational field (\"Laplace's fluid\") than\nthe modern hypothesis of immaterial spacetime as bendable. Although the Newton, Laplace and Poisson equations\ndidn't explain the material nature and mass of gravitational field, the field mass could be connected, at least formally,\nwith the field energy by using the Einstein mass-energy relation.\nThe basic hypothesis of present study is similar in spirit to both the aforementioned idea of a material gravitational\nfield and the concept of material gravitons of quantum gravity. The new approach for constructing a quantum\n\n\f149\nmodel of united gravitation and electromagnetism is based on the concept of material one-particle fields [14], i.e.\nthe gravito-electromagnetic unit-fields (quantum particles) that make up the local and global gravitoelectromagnetic\nquantum fields. The interaction of quantum fields is determined by interference (cross-correlation) of the unit-fields.\nThe mass-energy of quantum gravitoelectromagnetic field is given by the Einstein mass-energy relation modified by\nthe interference of material unit-fields. The fields are modelled to be representations of the Lorentz group in order\nto provide consistency of the model with the Einstein relativity, Lorentz-Maxwell electromagnetism and quantum\nmechanics (QM).\n2. THE IDEA OF A SINGLE FREE UNIT-FIELD WITH GRAVITO-ELECTRIC DRESS\n\nAccording to the concept [14], the present model assumes that any field \u03a8(r, t) of electrically-charged material\nquantum particles consists of the gravitoelectromagnetic (GEM) material unit-fields \u03a80i (r, t) attributed to the particles:\n\u03a8(r, t) =\n\nN\nX\n\n\u03a80i (r, t),\n\n(705)\n\ni=1\n\nwhere N is the number of particles. The superposition of unit-fields \u03a80i (r, t), which are one-particle fields, yields\nthe local (beams) and global quantum GEM fields \u03a8(r, t). In the global fields, N \u2192 \u221e. The pure gravitational (G)\nand pure electromagnetic (EM) fields present different aspects of the unified GEM-field \u03a8(r, t). The interaction of\nunit-fields \u03a80i (r, t) with each other is determined by interference (cross-correlation) of these unit-fields (see, Sect.\n10). The mass-energy of field \u03a8(r, t) is found by using the Einstein mass-energy relation modified by the interference\nof unit-fields \u03a80i (r, t). For conformity of the model with the special relativity, electromagnetism and QM, the fields\nare modelled to be representations of the Lorentz group.\nBefore presenting the model of united gravitation and electromagnetism (gravitoelectromagnetism), let me explain\nrelationship of the GEM unit-field to the special relativity and QM. The concept of GEM unit-fields is based on the\nde Broglie idea of a quantum particle (material wave or, in other words, material unit-field \u03c80 (r, t)) connected to the\nEinstein mass-energy relation for a point-like particle. In the special relativity, the mass-energy relation for a single\nfree point-particle located at the spacetime point (r, t) reads\n\u03b520 = m20 c4 + p20 c2 ,\n\n(706)\n\nwhere \u03b50 , m0 and p0 are the particle energy, rest mass and momentum. Using of Eq. (706) for a single free unit-field\n\u03c80 (r, t) yields the relativistic quantum (Klein-Gordon) mass-energy relation:\nh\u03c80 |\u03b5\u03022 |\u03c80 i = h\u03c80 |m20 c4 + p\u03022 c2 |\u03c80 i,\n\n(707)\n2\n\n2 2\n\u2202\n2\nwhere the squared energy and squared momentum are determined by the operators \u03b5\u03022 = \u2212~2 \u2202t\n2 and p\u0302 = \u2212~ \u2207 . In\nthe non-relativistic case of Eqs. (706) and (707), the immaterial psi-wave described by the psi-wavefunction \u03c80 (r, t)\nobeys rather the Copenhagen (statistical) meaning of QM than the field interpretation. In order to introduce the\nGEM interactions into Eq. (707), the state |\u03c80 i of the unit-field \u03c80 = \u03c80 (r, t) is replaced by\n\n|\u03a80 (r, t)i = \u03a60ge |\u03c80 (r, t)i.\n\n(708)\n\nThe operator \u03a60ge is interpreted as the \"operator of gravitoelectric (GE) dress\" that yields the dress mass. The bare\nunit-field \u03c80 could be thought as a carrier of massive GE dress (field). It is well known how to construct the operator\n\u03a6 = \u03a60e for electromagnetism by using the Dirac equation and so-called minimal substitution assumption (\u03b5 \u2192 \u03b5\u2212q\u03c6,\np \u2192 p + (q/c)A) [15]. However, it is not clear how to do that for gravity (\u03a6 = \u03a60g ) and gravitoelectromagnetism\n(\u03a6 = \u03a60ge ). The construction of the operator \u03a60ge for the gravitoelectrically dressed unit-field \u03a80 is impossible\nwithout additional assumptions.\n3. MODEL OF A SINGLE FREE UNIT-FIELD WITH GE DRESS\n\nIn the frame of the Euler-Lagrange formalism, the gravitoelectrically dressed unit-field is described by the Lagrangian\nZ\nL=\nLd3 x,\n(709)\nV\n\n\f150\nwhere\nL = ~2 \u03c8 \u03070\u2217 \u03c8 \u03070 \u2212 ~2 \u03a620ge \u2207\u03c80\u2217 \u2207\u03c80 \u2212 m20 c4 \u03a620ge \u03c80\u2217 \u03c80\n\n(710)\n\nis the Lagrangian density, the psi-wavefunction \u03c80 (r, t) describes the unit-field (de Broglie's psi-wave), \u03a60ge denotes\n\u2202\n\u03c80 . The equation of motion of the unit-field \u03c80 is found\nby varying\nthe operator of GE dress (field), and \u03c8 \u03070 = \u2202t\nR\nthe value \u03c80 under the fixed dress-parameter \u03a60ge . The least action principle for the action S = Ld4 x yields the\nEuler-Lagrange equation\n\u03b4L\n\u03b4L\n\u2212 \u2202\u03bc\n=0\n\u03b4\u03c8 \u2217\n\u03b4\u2202\u03bc \u03c8 \u2217\n\n(711)\n\nin the form of quantum equation for the united gravitation and electromagnetism:\n\u2212~2\n\n\u22022\n\u03c80 = m20 c4 \u03a620ge \u03c80 \u2212 ~2 \u03a620ge \u22072 \u03c80 .\n\u2202t2\n\n(712)\n\nThe unified mass-energy relation (712) reduces to the Klein-Gordon form (707) in case of the bare unit-field (\u03a60ge = 1).\nIn case of the time-dependent dress \u03a60ge = \u03a60ge (r, t), Eq. (712) can be presented as\n\u2212~2\n\n\u22022\n|\u03c80 (r, t)i = \u01242 (r, t)|\u03c80 (r, t)i,\n\u2202t2\n\n(713)\n\nwhere the nonstationary squared-energy \u03b520 = \u03b520 (t) of transient unit-field \u03c80 (r, t) is determined by the time-dependent\noperator\n\u0001\n\u01242 (r, t) = \u03a620ge (r, t) m20 c4 + c2 p\u03022 ,\n(714)\n\u0003\n\u0002\nwhich is identified with the squared Hamiltonian operator. For the stationary state (|\u03c80 (r, t)i = exp \u00b1 ~i \u03b50 t |\u03c80 (r)i),\nwhich is provided by the time-independent dress \u03a60ge = \u03a60ge (r), Eq. (712) reads\n\u0001\n(715)\n\u03b520 |\u03c80 (r)i = \u03a620ge (r) m20 c4 + c2 p\u03022 |\u03c80 (r)i.\nThe time-independent operator\n\n\u01242 (r) = \u03a620ge (r) m20 c4 + c2 p\u03022\n\n\u0001\n\n(716)\n\ndetermines the stationary squared-energy \u03b520 6= \u03b520 (t) of the eigen-state |\u03c80 (r)i with the normalization h\u03c80 (r)|\u03c80 (r)i =\n1.\nThe unit-field \u03c80 could be described also in the frame of the Hamilton-Jacobi formalism. The Lagrangian density\n(710) and the canonical relations H = \u03a0\u03c8 \u03070 \u2212 L and \u03a0 = \u2202L/\u2202 \u03c8 \u03070 yielded the Hamiltonian density\nH = m20 c4 \u03a620ge \u03c80\u2217 \u03c80 + ~2 \u03a620ge \u2207\u03c80\u2217 \u2207\u03c80 .\nThus, the Hamiltonian H =\n\nR\n\nV\n\n(717)\n\nHd3 x reads\nH = \u03b520 =\n\nZ\n\nV\n\n\u03c80\u2217 \u01242 \u03c80 d3 x,\n\n(718)\n\nwhere the squared\u0002Hamiltonian\noperator \u01242 is given by Eqs. (714) and (716) for the\n\u0003\nR transient (\u03c80 = \u03c80R(r, t)) and stai\ntionary (\u03c80 = exp \u00b1 ~ \u03b50 t \u03c80 (r)) unit-fields, respectively. Here, I used the relation V \u2207\u03c80\u2217 \u2207\u03c80 d3 x = \u2212 V \u03c80\u2217 \u22072 \u03c80 d3 x,\nbecause the parameter \u03a60ge was fixed under variation of the value \u03c80 . Note that the Hamiltonian-energy relation\nH = \u03b520 differs from the relation H = \u03b50 of QM and SM.\n4. EXPLICIT EXPRESSIONS FOR \u03a60ge AND REST-MASSES OF G AND E DRESSES\n\nWe now assume that the quantum particle (unit-field) at rest satisfies the Einstein mass-energy relation for the\ntotal rest-mass. The assumption, which is consistent with the special relativity, helps us to determine an explicit\nexpression for \u03a60ge . The concrete form and physical meaning of \u03a60ge are uncovered by analysing the steady state\n\n\f151\n\u0002\n\u0003\n|\u03c80 (r, t)i = exp \u00b1 ~i \u03b50 t |\u03c80 (r)i. In this state, the squared energy \u03b520 is given by Eq. (715), where the dress is timeindependent (\u03a60ge = \u03a60ge (r)). The kinetic energy of a classic (point-like) particle at rest vanishes. The kinetic energy\nof the quantum particle at rest (\u03c80 (r) = s0 (r)), which is determined by the term \u03a620ge (r)c2 p\u03022 |\u03c80 (r)i in Eq. (715),\nalso should be zero. The relation \u03a620ge (r)c2 p\u03022 |s0 (r)i = 0 implies\np\u03022 |s0 (r)i = 0.\n\n(719)\n\n\u03b50 = m0 hs0 (r)|\u03a60ge (r)|s0 (r)ic2 .\n\n(720)\n\nRespectively, Eq. (715) yields\n\nThe rest masses of the bare unit-field s0 (r) and the G and E dresses (fields) are assumed to be additive. Therefore,\nthe total rest mass M0 of the gravitoelectrically dressed unit-field is given by\nM0 = m0 + hm0g i + hm0e i,\n\n(721)\n\nwhere m0 , hm0g i and hm0e i denote the rest masses of the bare unit-field \u03c80 (r) = s0 (r) and the G and E dresses,\nrespectively. Thus, the Einstein mass-energy relation for the total rest-mass reads\n\u03b50 = (m0 + hm0g i + hm0e i) c2 ,\n\n(722)\n\nThe G and E rest-masses are connected to the gravitostatic and electrostatic potential energies of G and E fields by\nusing Eq. (722) for the potential energies:\nhm0g i = hs0 (r)|U0g (r)|s0 (r)ic\u22122 ,\n\nhm0e i = hs0 (r)|U0e (r)|s0 (r)ic\u22122 ,\n\n(723)\n\nwhere hs0 (r)|U0g (r)|s0 (r)i and hs0 (r)|U0e (r)|s0 (r)i denote the gravitostatic and electrostatic potential energies determined by the G and E static potentials \u03c60g (r) and \u03c60e (r):\nU0g (r) = m0 \u03c60g (r),\nU0e (r) = q0 \u03c60e (r).\n\n(724)\n\nIn order to provide consistency of the G and E potentials with the Newton gravitation and the Lorentz-Maxwell\nelectromagnetism, we assume that the static potentials \u03c60g (r) and \u03c60e (r) satisfy the Poisson equation:\n\u22072 \u03c60g = \u00b14\u03c0\u03b3N m0 \u03b4(r),\n\n\u22072 \u03c60e (r) = \u00b14\u03c0\u03b3C q0 \u03b4(r),\n\n(725)\n\nwhere \u03b4(r) is the Dirac delta. Equations (725) yielded the Newton-like and Coulomb-like potentials\nm0\n,\nr\nq0\n\u03c60e (r) = \u00b1\u03b3C ,\nr\n\n\u03c60g (r) = \u00b1\u03b3N\n\n(726)\n\nwhere q0 denotes the unit-field charge, and \u03b3N and \u03b3C are the Newton and Coulomb constants. The signs (\u00b1) are\nexplained in Sects. 10 and 12.2.\nThe comparison of Eq. (720) with (722) and the use of the rest-masses hm0g i and hm0e i determined by Eqs. (723)(726) imply the explicit expression\n\u03a60ge (r) = 1 +\n\nU0ge (r)\nm0 c2\n\n(727)\n\nfor \u03a60ge (r). In other words, the explicit expressions for \u03a60ge (r), hm0g i and hm0e i yielded the Einstein mass-energy\nrelation \u03b50 = M0 c2 for the total rest-mass M0 = m0 +hm0g i+hm0e i. Notice, the additivity (U0ge (r) = U0g (r)+U0e (r))\nof the fields U0g (r) and U0e (r) is in agreement with the additivity (hm0ge i = hm0g i + hm0e i) of the rest-masses hm0g i\nand hm0e i. Although the relation (721) looks like a naive model of the total rest-mass, the model explains the\ntwo long-standing problems in physics, namely the nature of an electron spin and the gravitostatic and electrostatic\nself-energies of an electron.\n\n\f152\n5. THE SPIN AND GRAVITOSTATIC AND ELECTROSTATIC SELF-ENERGIES OF UNIT-FIELD\n5.1 The particle spin attributed to the internal state of unit-field\n\nThe internal state |s0 (r)i of the unit-field at rest (\u03c80 (r) \u2261 s0 (r)) satisfies Eq.

The value r0 could be interpreted as the internal radius of unit-field.\nWe are looking for the solutions of Eq. (728) that do not diverge at r \u2192 0. They are given by the regular solid\nharmonics\ns0 (r) = Blm rl Ylm (\u03b8, \u03c6).\n\n(730)\n\nHere, Ylm (\u03b8, \u03c6) is the joint eigenfunction of the operator L\u03022 and the generator L\u0302z \u2261 \u015dz of rotations around the\nazimuthal axis:\nL\u03022 Ylm (\u03b8, \u03c6) = ~2 l(l + 1)Ylm (\u03b8, \u03c6),\nL\u0302z s0 (r) = ~ms0 (r).\nFor the Laplace spherical harmonics Ylm (\u03b8, \u03c6) normalized by hYlm |Ylm i =\n\u2212(2l+3)\n3)r0\n\n(731)\nR \u03c0 R 2\u03c0\n\n\u03b8=0 \u03c6=0\n\nYlm\u2217 Ylm d\u03a9 = 1, the constant\n\n(Blm )2 = (2l +\nprovides the normalization (729). The different species of quantum particles (unit-fields)\nshould correspond to the different values of l. For an orbital quantum number l, there are 2l + 1 independent\nspin wavefunctions (730), one for each magnetic quantum number m with \u2212l \u2264 m \u2264 l. Although the squared\ninternal momentum hp20s i of the unit-field vanishes (hp20s i = hs0 (r)|p\u03022 |s0 (r)i = 0) due to Eq. (719), the non-zero\ninternal momentum hp0s i = hs0 (r)|p\u0302|s0 (r)i 6= 0 for m 6= 0 yields the non-zero internal angular momentum (spin)\nhsz i = hs0 (r)|L\u0302z |s0 (r)i = ~m. Such behaviour is different from the classical mechanics of point particles, where p = 0\nif p2 = 0.\nThe above-described state |s0 (r)i is the internal state of unit-field \u03c80 (r). The internal state |s0 (r)i and the\ninternal momentum hp0s i = hs0 (r)|p\u0302|s0 (r)i could be extracted from the total state |\u03c80 (r)i and the total momentum\nhpi = h\u03c80 (r)|p\u0302|\u03c80 (r)i as follows:\n|\u03c80 (r)i = |s0 (r)i|\u03c8\u03030 (r)i,\n\n(732)\n\nhpi = hp0s i + hp\u0303i = h\u03c8\u03030 (r)|hs0 (r)|p\u0302|s0 (r)i|\u03c8\u03030 (r)i.\n\n(733)\n\nHere, the external momentum hp\u0303i = h\u03c8\u03030 (r)|p\u0302|\u03c8\u03030 (r)i is determined by the external state |\u03c8\u03030 (r)i of the external\nunit-field \u03c8\u03030 (r). The Hilbert state (732) means that the internal (s0 (r)) and external (\u03c8\u03030 (r)) unit-fields cannot be\nseparated from each other. Since the internal unit-field s0 (r) is local (r \u2208 [0, r0 ]), the nonlocality of state |s0 (r)i|\u03c8\u03030 (r)i\nis provided by the nonlocality (r \u2208 [0, \u221e]) of \u03c8\u03030 (r). The external unit-field \u03c8\u03030 (r) is assumed to be undividable for\nagreement with QM. For the total unit-field \u03c80 (r) at rest, Eq. (719) reads\np\u03022 |s0 (r)i|\u03c8\u03030 (r)i = 0.\n\n(734)\n\nThe equations\n(719)\n\u0003 and (734) should have the same solution |\u03c80 (r)i = |s0 (r)i. That is ensured by the solution \u03c8\u03030 (r)\n\u0002\n= exp \u00b1 ~i (0 * r) = 1 to the equation p\u03022 |\u03c8\u03030 (r)i = 0 and the transverse gauge\nhp0s ihp\u0303i = hs0 (r)|p\u0302|s0 (r)ih\u03c8\u03030 (r)|p\u0302|\u03c8\u03030 (r)i = 0\n\n(735)\n\n\f153\nimposed on the unit-field state (732), where hp\u0303i 6= 0 or hp\u0303i = 0. Notice,\nthe solution |\u03c80 (r)i = |s0 (r)i also means\n\u0001\nthat the total rest-mass M0 = h\u03c80 (r)| m0 + U0g (r)c\u22122 + U0e (r)c\u22122 |\u03c80 (r)i doesn't depend on \u03c8\u03030 (r).\nLet me now explain the electron spin. A simple analysis of Eqs. (728)-(731) shows that the spin state |s0 (r)i of\nthe internal unit-field s0 (r) should obey the quantum numbers l = 1 and m = \u00b11. The numbers yielded the spin\nstates |s0,+ i \u2261 |s0,l=1,m=+1 i and |s0,\u2212 i \u2261 |s0,l=1,m=\u22121 i with the spins hs0,+ |L\u0302z |s0,+ i = ~ and hs0,\u2212 |L\u0302z |s0,\u2212 i = \u2212~.\nIt is interesting that q\nthe state |s0,l=0,m=0 i doesn't satisfy the transverse gauge (735). Indeed, the spin wavefunction\n1\n4\u03c0\n\ns0,l=0,m=0 (r) = B00 r\n\n(see, Eq, (730)) yields\n\nhp0s ihp\u0303i = er hp0sr i(er hp\u0303r i + e\u0398 hp\u0303\u0398 i + e\u03c6 hp\u0303\u03c6 i) = hp0sr ihp\u0303r i 6= 0\n\n(736)\n\nfor hp\u0303r i 6= 0. Notice, the assumption of l = 1 and m = \u00b11 corresponds to the postulate of SU(2) symmetry in QM.\nThe difference between the value hs0,\u00b1 |L\u0302z |s0,\u00b1 i = \u00b1~ and the electron spin hs0,\u00b1 |L\u0302z |s0,\u00b1 i = \u00b1~/2 in QM is clarified\nin Sect. 11.\n5.2 The gravitostatic and electrostatic self-energies of an electron\ns\ns\nThe model explains the gravitostatic (U0g\n) and electrostatic (U0e\n) self-energies of an electron.

THE SQUARED EIGEN-ENERGY \u03b520 OF UNIT-FIELD BY \u01242\n\nAccording to Eqs.

THE EIGEN-ENERGY \u03b50 OF UNIT-FIELD BY \u0124\n\nThe Lorentz-Maxwell electromagnetism and Einstein general relativity look for the particle energy rather than the\nenergy squared. In order to find the eigen-energy \u03b50 of quantum particle (unit-field), I presented Eq.

If the dimensionless parameters hyi and hxi in Eqs. (747) and (749) are of order\none or larger, then the non-perturbation model based on Eqs.

THE OPERATORS \u0124 AND \u01242 BY USING THE SCALAR-POTENTIAL (\u03c60 ) AND\nVECTOR-POTENTIAL (\u00c2) OPERATORS\n\nThe squared Hamiltonian operator (742) and the Hamiltonian operator (749) are determined by the operator (743)\nthat includes the G (U0g ) and E (U0e ) static dresses (fields). The dresses are determined by Eq. (724), where the\nG and E internal scalar potentials (self-potentials) \u03c60g and \u03c60e are given by Eq. (726). Thus, the static dresses\nU0g = U0g (r) and U0e = U0e (r) and the static potentials \u03c60g = \u03c60g (r) and \u03c60e = \u03c60e (r) could be considered as the\ntime-independent operators in the operators (742) and (749).

MODEL OF A UNIT-FIELD IN EXTERNAL GEM STATIC-FIELD\n\nLet me extend the model of a single unit-field dressed into internal GE static-field U0ge (r) = U0g (r) + U0e (r) to the\nunit-field placed in an external GE static-field Uge (r) = Ug (r) + Ue (r). Because of the principle of additivity applied\nto the internal and external fields (dresses) U0ge (r) and Uge (r), the operator U0ge (r) = U0g (r) + U0e (r) in Eqs.

Using of Eqs. (739) and (740) yielded the relation\nhU0ge i = h\u03c8\u03030 (r)|hs0 (r)|U0ge (r)|s0 (r)i|\u03c8\u03030 (r)i = hs0 (r)|h\u03c8\u03030 (r)|U0ge (r)|\u03c8\u03030 (r)i|s0 (r)i.\n\n(755)\n\nThe independence of the external potential energy hUge i from the internal state |s0 (r)i implies the relation\nhUge i = hs0 (r)|h\u03c8\u03030 (r)|Uge (r)|\u03c8\u03030 (r)i|s0 (r)i = h\u03c8\u03030 (r)|hs0 (r)|Uge (r)|s0 (r)i|\u03c8\u03030 (r)i.\n\n(756)\n\nFor the the operators (742) and (749), the principle of additivity for the internal and external scalar and vector\npotentials (dresses) yields the parameter (751) in the form\nx=\n\np\u03022\n+\nm20 c2\n\n2(m0 \u00c2\u22c6g + q0 \u00c2\u22c6e )p\u0302 (m0 \u00c2\u22c6g + q0 \u00c2\u22c6e )2\n2(m0 \u03c6\u22c6g + q0 \u03c6\u22c6e ) (m0 \u03c6\u22c6g + q0 \u03c6\u22c6e )2\n+\n+\n+\n.\nm0 c2\nm20 c4\nm20 c3\nm20 c4\n\n(757)\n\nThis means that the operators (753) and (754) in Eq.

In case of the non-quantum external fields, the operators \u00c2g (r)\nand \u00c2e (r) obey the forms of G and M non-quantum vector-potentials Ag (r) and Ae (r). The pure-G and pure-EM\ninteractions are described by the operator (757) with \u03c6\u22c6e (r) = \u00c2\u22c6e (r) = 0 and \u03c6\u22c6g (r) = \u00c2\u22c6g (r) = 0, respectively.\nThe relations (741), (742), (745), (749) and (757) predict new physical phenomena for strong potentials. For\ninstance, the united GE interaction is described by the operators \u03c6\u22c6g \u03c6\u22c6e and \u00c2\u22c6g \u00c2\u22c6e of Eq. (757). The physical picture\nof interactions based on the Taylor expansion of \u0124(x) in Eq. (749) depends on the number of terms in the expansion.\nThe terms of more than second order in the potentials describe the combined interactions, which are the high-order\ncombinations of G, EM and GEM quantum interactions. In case of the weak scalar (h\u03c6\u22c6g i, h\u03c6\u22c6e i) and/or vector (hA\u22c6g i,\nhA\u22c6e i) potentials, the combined interactions could be neglected.\n\n\f156\n10.

The multi-unitfield \u03c8 =\nPN\nPN\ni=1 \u03c80i (ri ) consists of the bare unit-fields \u03c80i = \u03c80i (ri ). The stationary multi-unitfield \u03a8 =\ni=1 \u03a80i (ri ) discussed\nin Sect. 2 is a superposition of the dressed unit-fields \u03a80i (ri ) = \u03a60i,ge (ri )\u03c80i (ri ), which should be representations\nof the Lorentz group. The unit-fields \u03a80i (ri ) are representations of the Lorentz group, because the operator p\u0302 and\nthe potentials (763) and (764) were modelled to satisfy the Lorentz transformations. Notice, the relations (767) and\n(768) indicate the orbit-orbit, spin-orbit and spin-spin (exchange) interactions of the unit-fields \u03c8i (ri ) (see, Sects. 11\nand 12).\nThe Pauli exclusion principle is a postulate in QM.

COMPARISON OF THE BASIC HAMILTONIAN OPERATORS OF QM WITH THE PRESENT\nMODEL\n\nLet me derive the Hamiltonian operators for an electron unit-field (charged quantum particle) placed in a E or EM\nstatic field, which are the low-order approximations to the unified Hamiltonian (749) in the parameter (762). For the\n\u22c6\n= U0g +U0e +Ug +Ue \u2248 Ue .\ncomparison with QM, the G-field Ug\u22c6 = U0g +Ug and E self-field U0e are neglected, i.e. Uge\n\u0001\nIn the E or EM static field, the electron unit-field obeys the stationary state |\u03c80 (r, t)i = exp \u00b1 ~i \u03b50 t |s\u00b1 (r)i|\u03c8\u03030 (r)i.\nFor the E field, keeping the first two terms in Eqs.

Notice, in Eqs. (770) and (771), I also use the relations (729), (734), (735), (739), (740), (755)\nand (756).\nFor the electron unit-field placed in the EM field, taking into account the first two terms in Eq. (749) and the 1st,\n2nd, 4th and 5th terms in Eq. (757) yields Eq. (712) in the form (770), where\n\u0124 =\n\nq0 \u00112\n1 \u0010\np\u0302 + \u00c2e + q0 \u03c6e .\n2m0\nc\n\n(773)\n\nHere, the operators \u03c6e = \u03c6e (r) and \u00c2e = \u00c2e (r) correspond to the external scalar and vector (M) potentials. The\nHamiltonian (773) is well-known in QM [17, 18]. For the non-quantum M-field Be (r) determined by the relations\n\n\f158\nAe = (1/2)Be \u00d7 r and \u2207Ae = 0 [16], Eq.

(774) for the comparison with QM. In Eq. (774), the orbital\nmomentum hLz i and the spin hsz i are given by hLz i = h\u03c8\u03030 |L\u0302z |\u03c8\u03030 i = \u00b1~m and hsz i = hs\u00b1 |L\u0302z |s\u00b1 i = \u00b1~. In QM, the\nrespective equation [17, 18] obeys the form (774), where the orbital momentum hLz i = \u00b1~m, the spin hsz i = \u00b1~/2,\nand the non-unified gyromagnetic factors are given by gL = 1 and gs = 2. The comparison of Eq. (774) with QM\nreveals the unified gyromagnetic factor g = gL = gs = 1 in the present model. That explains difference between the\nspin hs\u00b1 |L\u0302z |s\u00b1 i = \u00b1~ in Eq. (774) and the value hs\u00b1 |\u015dz |s\u00b1 i = \u00b1~/2 in QM.\n12.

The relations (791) and (792) for the E potentials are equivalent to the Maxwell equations\n\u22c6\n(r,t)p\u0302\nunder the Lorenz gauge, \u00c2\u22c6e (r, t) = \u03c6 m\n\u2192 Ae (r, t) = \u03c6(r,t)p\nand p = m0 v (see, Sect. 14.2.).

The relations (790), (791) and (792) are consistent with Lorentz's transformations. In\nterms of the energy \u03b50 (t), the relation (790) reads\n\u00b1i~\n\n\u2202\n|\u03c80 (r, t)i = \u0124(x)|\u03c80 (r, t)i.\n\u2202t\n\n(793)\n\n\f161\nBy analogy with the very simple derivations of formulas in Sects. 11 and 12, one can easily show that the timedependent perturbation models of transient physical phenomena used in QM and QE, for instance, the models of\nscattering, emission and absorption of EM waves, are the low-order approximations to Eq. (793) in the parameter\nx = x(r, t).\n14.

This means that Eqs.

They are in agreement with all known\nsolutions of the special and general relativities proved by experiments.\nThe model suggests explanations of the so-called dark matter and dark energy. Indeed, in principle, a GE unitfield may lose its electric dress (U0ge \u2192 U0g ) in transient (scattering) process by radiation of the photon energy\n~\u03c9 = hm0e ic2 (Sects. 3 and 13). The pure-G particle is the dark matter, because the particle doesn't interact through\nEM forces. The G-potential is determined by the equation \u22072 \u03c60g = 4\u03c0\u03b3N m0 \u03b4(r) with the general solution \u03c60g (r) =\n\u2212\u03b3N mr0 \u00b1 m0 |Blm |( Rr0 )l Ylm (\u03b8, \u03c6) (see, Eqs. (725), (726), (728) and (765)). If the potential \u2212m0 |Blm |( Rr0 )l Ylm (\u03b8, \u03c6)\ndoes exist in the nature, then this term explains the dark energy. Indeed, for r \u226b R0 , the potential induces the\n\u2202L\nrepulsive force Fg = \u2202rg that increases with the increase of r. The repulsive force could be induced also by the\nattractive G-force of dark particles, because they are invisible in EM experiments.\n15. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nThe new approach for constructing a unified quantum model of G and EM fields and interactions has been presented.\nThe approach is based on a concept of interfering (cross-correlating) material unit-fields. Starting from the Einstein\nmass-energy relation and using this concept, the quantum equation for united gravitation and electromagnetism was\nderived. The unified equation yields all known solutions to the Dirac equation. As an example, the fine and hyperfine\nstructure of the atom spectrum was derived. Furthermore, the unified model suggests explanations of the Pauli\nexclusion principle, the physical nature of spin and anomalous gyromagnetic factorP\nof an electron and the electron\nN\ngravitostatic and electrostatic self-energies. Replacement of the field state |\u03c8i = i=1 |\u03c80i (ri )i by the QM state\nQN\n|\u03c8i = i=1 |\u03c80i (ri )i in Eqs. (767) and (768) explains how QFT transits to QM and vice versa. In case of the transient\nunit-fields, the quantum equation for united gravitation and electromagnetism is coupled to the generalised waveequations for G and E scalar and vector potentials. The coupled equations describe, for instance, the scattering,\nemission and absorption of G and EM waves. For weak potentials, in the classical limit, the model simplifies to the\nLorentz-Maxwell electromagnetism and the so-called GEM approximation of Einstein's general relativity. This means\nthat the model is in agreement with all known experimental tests of the special and general relativities. In case of the\nstrong potentials, the model yielded new predictions. For instance, the cross-correlation of G and E strong potentials\npredicts the \"anti-gravity force\". If the G and E potentials don't correlate with each other, then the model simplifies\nto the pure-G and pure-EM fields and interactions. Finally, the model suggested explanations also of \"dark matter\"\nand \"dark energy\".\nThe concept of interfering material unit-fields doesn't require any metaphysical interpretation. Nevertheless, one\ncould connect the concept to the most popular philosophic explanation of evolution (E ) of material and/or immaterial\nsubstances [21]. The evolution is described by the formula E = Q4P , were Q4P denotes the quest for possibility.\nThe present model yields the formula E = I 3 , which shows that the evolution is caused by the interference-induced\ninteraction (I 3 ) mediated by interference (cross-correlation) of the substances.\nThe unified quantum equation could be important for analysis of more particular physical problems, such as the\ncosmology of black holes and the near field (subwavelength) optics and photonics that deal with the strong potentials\nand relativistic particles. It is well known that EM interactions are unified with weak interactions into electroweak\ntheory. The GEM and nuclear fields and interactions will be united in the next article.\n\n[1]\n[2]\n[3]\n[4]\n[5]\n[6]\n[7]\n[8]\n\nJ. C. Maxwell Phil. Trans. R. Soc. 155 459 (1865)\nO.

Part II developed this background for unification of the electromagnetic, weak, strong and gravitational\nfields and interactions. However, unlike in Part I, the unification has been performed rather by the generalization of\nthe basic (energy-mass) relation of the Einstein special relativity than the traditional Hamiltonians of the classical\nand quantum field theories. Part III presented a unified quantum model of gravitation and electromagnetism.\nThe model is based on a concept of cross-correlating material unit-fields.

For strong fields and relativistic particles, the unified model yields new predictions compared to\nthe Einstein gravity and Maxwell-Lorentz electromagnetism. The model explains physical nature of the spin and\nanomalous gyromagnetic factor of an electron, as well as the Pauli exclusion principle. The cross-correlation of\ngravitational and electric potentials predicts the existence of \"antigravitational\" forces. Keeping terms of no more\nthan second order in the potential yields the Hamiltonians of canonical quantum mechanics. Part IV extends the\nmodel to weak-nuclear and strong-nuclear fields and interactions. Using the energy-mass relation of Einstein's\nspecial relativity and the concept of unit-fields carrying the gravitational, electric and strong-nuclear \"dressings\",\nthe unified quantum equations and their classical limits for gravitational, electromagnetic, weak-nuclear and strongnuclear fields and interactions are derived. The results of unified model are in agreement with the Standard\nModel. Furthermore, the cross-correlation of electric and strong-nuclear potentials of the electric and strongnuclear \"dressings\" explains the physical nature of weak-nuclear force. While the cross-correlation of gravitational\nand strong-nuclear potentials predicts the new kind of interactions, namely the gravito-strongnuclear forces.\n\nI. INTRODUCTION\n\nUnification of the gravitational, electromagnetic, weak-nuclear and strong-nuclear fields and interactions is a longstanding problem in physics. The generally accepted unified description of electromagnetic, weak, and strong interactions, which does not include gravity, is provided by the Standard Model of Particle Physics (SM) in terms of\nthe gauge and broken-gauge symmetries. SM is considered as the final outcome of quantum field theory combining\nthe basic physical conceptions of quantum mechanics with special relativity [1\u201322]. In its generally accepted form,\nSM has been developed mainly by S. Glashow, A. Salam, S. Weinberg, F. Englert, R. Brout, and P.W. Higgs (see,\nfor example, the studies [23\u201330] and references therein). SM is based on the three independent gauge symmetries,\ninteractions and coupling constants, which are attributed to the electromagnetic, weak-nuclear and strong-nuclear\ninteractions of particles. There are several similar candidate models, for instance, Grand Unified Theories (GUTs),\nin which at high energy, the three gauge interactions of SM are merged into one single interaction characterized by\none larger gauge symmetry and thus one unified coupling constant. Some models, which exhibit similar properties,\ndo not unify all interactions using one simple Lie group as the gauge symmetry, but do so using semi-simple groups\n\n\f165\nor other super-symmetries. GUTs are considered as an intermediate step towards a Theory of Everything (TE) that\nwould unify gravity with electromagnetic, weak-nuclear, and strong-nuclear interactions. String Theory is currently\nconsidered as a candidate for TE. The description of candidate theories and generally accepted models can be found\nin research articles and textbooks published in the last 100 years.\nAlthough today we know that the electromagnetism is part of a larger gauge group described by the Standard\nModel (SM), SM does not include gravity. In this regard, one could mention the famous article of A. Einstein and\nN. Rosen that tried to unify the Maxwell-Lorentz electromagnetism with the Einstein theory of gravity [31]. The\nnew approach for constructing a unified quantum model of gravitation and electromagnetism has been presented\nin the study [32]. This approach has been inspired by the de Broglie idea of material waves (quantum particles).\nThe approach is based on a concept of cross-correlating material unit-fields carrying the gravitational and electric\nassociate components (\"dressings\"). Connecting the mass-energy relation of Einstein's special relativity with this\nconcept, the unified quantum equations for gravitation and electromagnetism were derived. For strong fields and\nrelativistic particles, the unified model yielded new predictions in comparison to the Einstein gravity and MaxwellLorentz electromagnetism. The model explains the spin and anomalous gyromagnetic factor of an electron, as well\nas the Pauli exclusion principle. The cross-correlation of gravitational and electric potentials of the gravitational and\nstrong-nuclear \"dressings\" predicts the existence of \"antigravitational\" interactions, i.e., the gravitoelectric repulsive\nforces acting in opposite direction to the gravitational attraction. Keeping terms of no more than second order in\nthe potential yields the Hamiltonians of canonical quantum mechanics. For weak fields, the model simplifies to the\nMaxwell-Lorentz electromagnetism and the so-called gravitoelectromagnetic approximation of the Einstein gravity.\nThe aforementioned model [32] is based on a concept of cross-correlating material unit-fields (quantum particles)\nthat only have gravitational and electric \"dressings\". The present study extends this model to the unit-fields carrying\nstrong-nuclear \"dressing\". Using the unit-fields with gravitational, electric, and strong-nuclear \"dressings\" yields a\nunified quantum model of gravitational, electromagnetic, weak-nuclear, and strong-nuclear fields and interactions.\nII. UNIFIED QUANTUM MODEL OF A SINGLE UNIT-FIELD (PARTICLE)\n\nAccording to the concept of cross-correlating material unit-fields [32], any field \u03a8(r, t) of quantum particles consists\nof the cross-correlating (interfering), material unit-fields \u03a80n (r, t) attributed to the particles:\n\u03a8(r, t) =\n\nN\nX\n\n\u03a80n (r, t),\n\n(809)\n\nn=1\n\nwhere N is the number of particles. Unification of gravitational, electromagnetic, weak-nuclear, and strong-nuclear\nfields and interactions is performed by generalization of the Einstein energy-mass relation for the unit-fields carrying\nthe gravitational, electric, and strong-nuclear \"dressings\".\nA. Generalized energy-mass relation\n\nLet us connect the energy-mass relation of Einstein's special relativity of a classical point-like particle (N = 1) with\nthe de Broglie idea of material wave attributed to a particle. The energy-mass relation for a point particle located at\nthe spacetime point (r, t) is given by Einstein's special relativity,\n\u03b520 = m20 c4 + p20 c2 ,\n\n(810)\n\nwhere \u03b50 , m0 and p0 are particle energy, rest mass and momentum. Connecting the concept (809) for a material\nunit-field (quantum particle) with the relation (810) yields the quantum energy-mass relation in the Klein-Gordon\nform, which in the Dirac notations reads\nh\u03a80 |\u03b5\u03022 |\u03a80 i = h\u03a80 |m20 c4 + c2 p\u03022 |\u03a80 i,\n\n(811)\n\n2\n\n\u2202\nwhere, \u03a801 (r, t) \u2261 \u03a80 (r, t), and p\u03022 = \u2212~2 \u22072 and \u03b5\u03022 = \u2212~2 \u2202t\n2 denote the operators of the squared momentum and\nenergy, respectively.\nIn order to describe the gravitational, electromagnetic, weak-nuclear and strong-nuclear fields and interactions, the\nunit-field \u03a80 is assumed to be structured as\n\n|\u03a80 (r, t)i = \u03a60ges (r)|\u03c80 (r, t)i,\n\n(812)\n\n\f166\nwhere |\u03a80 (r, t)i and |\u03c80 (r, t)i denote the states of the unit-field \u03a80 (r, t) and the unit-field generator \u03c80 (r, t). The\nintrinsic structure indicates indivisible connection of the generator \u03c80 with the associate-component \u03a60ges . We\nassume that the unit-field \u03a80 is mediated by the generator \u03c80 , because \u03a80 = 0 for \u03c80 = 0. The associate-component\nis interpreted as the gravitoelectic-strongnuclear (ges) \"dressing\" of the unit-field generator, which can be thought as\na \"carrier of the gravitational (g), electric (e) and strong-nuclear (s) \"dressings\".\nThe generalization of Eq. (811) for the \"gravitoelectic-strongnuclearly dressed\" unit-field is impossible without\nadditional assumptions. The derivation of the generalized energy-mass relation for the structured unit-field (812) is\nbased on the following assumptions. The stationary value of the squared energy (811) is given by the stationary form\n\u0013\n\u0012\ni\n(813)\n|\u03a80 (r, t)i = exp \u00b1 \u03b50 t \u03a60ges (r)|\u03c80 (r)i\n~\nof the unit-field state (812), which indicates that the energy operator could be presented as\n\u03b5\u03022 = \u2212~2\n\n1\n\u22022\n.\n\u03a6\u22170ges \u03a60ges \u2202t2\n\n(814)\n\nIn such case, Eq. (811) yields the stationary squared energy\n\nh\u03c80 |\u03a6\u22170ges \u03a60ges m20 c4\n\n+\n\nh\u03c80 |\u03b520 |\u03c80 i =\n\u2217\n2 2\n\u03a60ges c p\u0302 \u03a60ges |\u03c80 i,\n\n(815)\n\nThe mass-energy relation (815) should reduce to the Klein-Gordon form (811) if the unit-field \u03a80 (r, t) looses the ges\n\"dressing\". That indicates that the associate component \u03a60ges (r) has the form\n\u03a60ges (r) = 1 +\n\nU0ges (r)\n.\nm0 c2\n\n(816)\n\nWe assume the additivity of gravitational (U0g (r)), electric (U0g (r)) and strong-nuclear (U0s (r)) components:\nU0ges (r) = U0g (r) + U0e (r) + U0s (r).\n\n(817)\n\nThe Laplace and Helmholtz calibrations\n\u22072 U0ge (r) = 0\n\n(818)\n\n\u22072 U0s (r) = |\u0393s |2 U0s (r)\n\n(819)\n\nare imposed respectively on the terms U0ge (r) = U0g (r) + U0e (r) and U0s (r). The transverse gauge\n\u2207U0ge (r)\u2207\u03c80 (r) = 0.\n\n(820)\n\nis used for the term U0ge (r) and generator \u03c80 (r), whereas the gauge\n\u2207U0s (r)\u2207\u03c80 (r) + |\u0393s |2 U0s (r)\u03c80 (r) = 0.\n\n(821)\n\nis used for U0s (r) and \u03c80 (r). Notice, Eqs. (816)-(821) yielded the relation p\u03022 (\u03a60ges \u03c80 ) = \u03a60ges p\u03022 \u03c80 . In addition, we\nimpose the conditions\n\u03a60ges = \u03a6\u22170ges\n\n(822)\n\nh\u03c80 (r)|\u03c80 (r)i = 1,\n\n(823)\n\nwhich provide the real value of \u03a60ges and the appropriate normalization of \u03c80 (r). The meaning of \"ad hoc\" assumptions (812)-(823) becomes evident in Sects. II.B.3 and II.C (See Eqs. (854)-(864) and (877) that support the\nassumptions). One can compare these assumptions with the so-called \"minimal substitution\" assumptions \u03b5 \u2192 \u03b5 \u2212 q\u03c6\n\n\f167\nand p \u2192 p + (q/c)A of Field Theory. Using the relations (816)-(823) in Eq. (815) yields the generalized energy-mass\nrelation\n\u0012\n\u00132\nU0ges (r)\n2\nh\u03c80 |\u03b50 |\u03c80 i = h\u03c80 | 1 +\nm20 c4 |\u03c80 i\nm0 c2\n\u00132\n\u0012\nU0ges (r)\n+h\u03c80 | 1 +\nc2 p\u03022 |\u03c80 i.\n(824)\nm0 c2\nIn the differential form, the integral relation (824) reads\n\u03b520 |\u03c80 i\nwhere the operator\n\n\u00132\n\u0012\n\u0001\nU0ges (r)\nm20 c4 + c2 p\u03022 |\u03c80 i,\n= 1+\nm0 c2\n\n\u0012\n\u00132\n\u0001\nU0ges (r)\n\u0124 = 1 +\nm20 c4 + c2 p\u03022\n2\nm0 c\n2\n\n(825)\n\n(826)\n\nis the squared Hamiltonian operator having the eigen-generator state |\u03c80 i and the eigen-value \u03b520 . Notice, the relation\n(824) simplifies to the Klein-Gordon form (811) in the case of U0ges (r) = 0.\n1. Identification of the gravitational (U0g (r)), electric (U0e (r)) and strong-nuclear (U0s (r)) components\n\nSpherically symmetric solutions of Eq. (818) that do not diverge at r \u2192 \u221e are given by the irregular solid harmonics\nU0g (r) = Aglm r\u2212l\u22121 Ylm (\u03b8, \u03c6)\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\nU0e (r) = Ael\u2032 m\u2032 r\u2212l \u22121 Ylm\n(\u03b8, \u03c6),\n\u2032\n\n(827)\n(828)\n\nwhere Ylm (\u03b8, \u03c6) is the spherical harmonic of degree l and order m, Aglm and Ael\u2032 m\u2032 are the constants, and r = (r, \u03b8\u03c6).\nFor a given non-negative integer l, there are 2l + 1 independent configurations (827), one for each integer m with\n\u2212l \u2264 m \u2264 l. The divergent solutions, which are based on the regular solid harmonics, are described in Sec. VI.A.\nThe gravitational (827) and electric (828) components with the lowest degree (l = l\u2032 = 0) and the respective order\n(m = m\u2032 = 0), which satisfy the condition (822), uncover the physical meaning of the components:\nU0g (r) = \u00b1\u03b3g\n\nm20\nr\n\n(829)\n\nU0e (r) = \u00b1\u03b3e\n\nq02\n,\nr\n\n(830)\n\nwhere \u03b3g and \u03b3e are respectively the gravitational (Newton) and electric (Coulomb) constants, and q0 denotes the\nelectrical charge of unit-field. The terms (829) and (830) are identified with the gravitational and electrical potential\nself-energies of the unit-field. The positive mass (m0 \u2265 0) excludes the meaningless negative values of the Einstein\nenergy \u03b50 = m0 c2 of a particle at rest. The sign (\u2212) in Eqs. (829) and (830) yields the attractive gravitational and\nelectric self-forces, whereas the repulsive self-forces are explained by the sign (+). To provide the attractive forces,\nwe will use the sign (\u2212).\nSpherically symmetric solutions of Eq. (819) that could be associated with the strong-nuclear potential self-energy\nU0s (r) are given by\nU0s (r) = Aslm jl (i|\u0393s |r) Ylm (\u03b8, \u03c6),\n\n(831)\n\nwhere Aslm is the constant, jl (i|\u0393s |r) is the Bessel function of first kind with the imaginary argument i|\u0393s |r. The\nBessel functions of first kind with the real argument |\u0393s |r and/or the Bessel functions of second kind, which are also\n\n\f168\nsolutions of Eq. (819) have been considered Chapter II. The harmonic degree l = 0 and the respective order m = 0 in\nEq. (831), which satisfy the condition (822), yielded\nU0s (r) = a\n\ne\u2212|\u0393s|r\ne|\u0393s |r\n\u2212b\n,\nr\nr\n\n(832)\n\nwhere a and b are the constants. For instance, in the case of a = 0 and b = \u2212\u03b3s Q20 , the potential self-energy U0s (r)\nobeys the Yukawa form\nU0s (r) = \u03b3s Q20\n\ne\u2212|\u0393s |r\n,\nr\n\n(833)\n\n\u2212|\u0393s |r\n\nis the Yukawa potential, \u03b3s is the strong-nuclear constant, and Q0 is the color charge with the value\nwhere \u03b3s Q0 e r\nQ0 \u2265 0. The self-energy (833) vanishes at r \u226b |\u0393s |\u22121 and becomes infinite (U0s (r) \u2192 \u221e) at r \u2192 0. The potential\nself-energy (832) with a = \u2212b = \u2212\u03b3s Q20 reads\n\u0012 |\u0393s |r\n\u0013\ne\ne\u2212|\u0393s |r\nU0s (r) = \u2212\u03b3s Q20\n.\n(834)\n+\nr\nr\nThe potential self-energy (834) becomes infinite (U0s (r) \u2192 \u2212\u221e) at r \u2192 0 and r \u2192 \u221e.\nWe will see that the strong-nuclear fields and interactions correspond to Eq. (834) rather than Eq. (833). Notice,\nEqs. (818) and (819) have the same solutions as the respective equations \u22072 U0g (r) = 4\u03c0\u03b3g m20 \u03b4(r), \u22072 U0e (r) =\n4\u03c0\u03b3e q02 \u03b4(r) and \u22072 U0s (r) \u2212 |\u0393s |2 U0s (r) = 4\u03c0\u03b3s Q2 \u03b4(r), where \u03b4(r) is the Dirac delta. It could be mentioned that the\nsolutions of Eqs. (818) and (819) having the non-spherical symmetries are discussed in Ref. [32].\n2. The spin of a unit-field\n\nThe second term on the right-hand side of Eq. (824) is associated with the unit-field kinetic energy. The kinetic\nenergy of a particle (unit-field) at rest vanishes. Therefore, the generator state |\u03c80 (r)i \u2261 |s(r)i of the unit-field at\nrest satisfies the equation\np\u03022 |s(r)i = 0.\nFor the spherically symmetric generator, Eq. (835) reads\n#\n\"\nL\u03022\n~2 \u2202 2\n2 2\nr \u2212 2 s(r) = 0,\n~ \u2207 s(r) =\nr \u2202r2\nr\n\n(835)\n\n(836)\n\nwhere L\u03022 is the square of the angular momentum operator L\u0302 = r \u00d7 p\u0302 = i~(r \u00d7 \u2207) and p\u0302 is the momentum operator.\nTherefore the generator \u03c80 (r) = s(r) is called the spin psi-wavefunction. Similarly to Eq. (818), the solutions of\nEq. (836) are given by in the regular\ns(r) = Blm rl Ylm (\u03b8, \u03c6)\n\n(837)\n\ns(r) = Clm r\u2212l\u22121 Ylm (\u03b8, \u03c6)\n\n(838)\n\nand/or irregular\n\nsolid harmonics, where Blm and Clm are constants; Ylm (\u03b8, \u03c6) are the joint eigenfunctions of the operator L\u03022 and the\ngenerator L\u0302z of rotations around the azimuthal axis:\nL\u03022 Ylm (\u03b8, \u03c6) = ~2 l(l + 1)Ylm (\u03b8, \u03c6)\n\n(839)\n\nL\u0302z s(r) = ~ms(r).\n\n(840)\n\nThe different species of particles (unit-fields) correspond to the different values of l and m. For an orbital quantum\nnumber l, there are 2l + 1 independent spin wavefunctions (837), one for each magnetic quantum number m with \u2212l \u2264\nm \u2264 l. Although the squared intrinsic quantum momentum of the unit-field vanishes (hp20s i = hs(r)|p\u03022 |s(r)i = 0), the\nintrinsic quantum momentum hp0s i = hs(r)|p\u0302|s(r)i 6= 0 yields the non-vanishing intrinsic angular momentum (spin)\nhsz i = hs(r)|L\u0302z |s(r)i = ~m for m 6= 0. Such behaviour is different from the classic mechanics of a point particle,\nwhere p = 0 if p2 = 0.\n\n\f169\nB. Generalized energy-mass relation for a unit-field with spin\n\nThe intrinsic momentum hp0s i = hs(r)|p\u0302|s(r)i and the intrinsic generator |s(r)i can be extracted from the total\nmomentum hpi = h\u03c80 (r)|p\u0302|\u03c80 (r)i and the total generator |\u03c80 (r)i:\nhpi = hp0s i + hp\u0303i = h\u03c8\u03030 (r)|hs(r)|p\u0302|s(r)i|\u03c8\u03030 (r)i\n\n(841)\n\n|\u03c80 (r)i = |s(r)i|\u03c8\u03030 (r)i,\n\n(842)\n\nwhere hp\u0303i = h\u03c8\u03030 (r)|p\u0302|\u03c8\u03030 (r)i is the external momentum corresponding to the external generator |\u03c8\u03030 (r)i, and the\nintrinsic generator |s(r)i denotes the spin state.\nUsing the representation (842) yields the energy-mass relation (824) in the new form:\nh\u03c8\u03030 |hs|\u03b520 |si|\u03c8\u03030 i = h\u03c8\u03030 |hs|\u01242 |si|\u03c8\u03030 i.\n\n(843)\n\nTaking into account Eqs.

(823) and (844) for a unit-field at rest (|\u03c8\u03030 i = 1) yielded the Einstein energy-mass\nrelation\n\u03b520 = hs|sim20 c4 = m20 c4\n\n(845)\n\nunder the condition hs|si = 1. For the orbital quantum number l \u2265 1, the condition is provided by the normalizations\nZ\n\n\u03c0\n\nhs|si =\n\nZ\n\n\u03c0\n\nhs|si =\n\n\u03b8=0\n\n\u03b8=0\n\nZ\n\n2\u03c0\n\nZ\n\n2\u03c0\n\nZ\n\nr0 6=\u221e\n\nZ\n\nR0 =\u221e\n\nd\u03a9\n\n\u03c6=0\n\n\u03c6=0\n\ns\u2217 (r)s(r)r2 dr = 1.\n\n(846)\n\n0\n\nd\u03a9\n\ns\u2217 (r)s(r)r2 dr = 1.\n\n(847)\n\nr0 6=\u221e\n\nfor the regular (837) and irregular (838) solid harmonics, respectively. The relation (846) indicates that the intrinsic\n(spin) wavefunctions corresponding to the regular solid harmonics obey the finite (r0 6= \u221e) dimension, i.e., the spin\nwavefunctions are local. While, Eq. (847) reveals the non-locality of the spin wavefunctions based on the irregular\nsolid harmonics with infinite (R0 = \u221e) radius. If l = 0, respectively m = 0, then Eq. (840) yields the zero spin\n(hsz i = hs(r)|L\u0302z |s(r)i = 0). For irregular harmonics with l = 0, Eqs. (846) and (847) yielded hs|si = \u221e. In the case of\nthe unit-fields with zero spins, the condition hs|si = 1 is provided by the regular harmonics and Eq. (846). Thus the\nunit-fields with non-zero spins are described by the regular (local) or irregular (non-local) harmonics with the orbital\nquantum number l \u2265 1, whereas the zero-spin unitfields correspond to the regular harmonics with l = 0. Notice, the\nrelation (846) means that the spin wavefunction vanishes (s(r) = 0) for r > r0 . In the case of Eq. (847), s(r) = 0 for\nr < r0 .\n1.

The second, third and forth terms on the right-hand side of Eq.

The spherical symmetry of the non-local spin wavefunctions based on the irregular solid harmonics (838) could be affected by a border placed at infinite distance from\nthe particle. The rest-masses determined by such exotic (non-local) spin wavefunctions are calculated in the Appendix.\nHere, we consider the unit-fields with local spin wavefunctions based on the regular solid harmonics (837). For the\nunit-fields with the spins (l \u2265 0), Eqs. (860), (846), (837) and (829) and Eqs.

The gravitoelectromagnetic properties of unit-fields are\ndetermined by Eq. (884), where the intrinsic cross-correlation (interference) of gravitational and electric potentials is\ngiven by the operators \u03c60g \u03c60e and \u00c20g \u00c20e . The cross-correlation of gravitational and strong-nuclear potentials inside\nthe pure gravito-strongnuclear unit-fields is described by the operators \u03c60g \u03c60s and \u00c20g \u00c20s in Eq. (885), whereas the\noperators \u03c60e \u03c60s and \u00c20e \u00c20s in equation (886) describe the cross-correlation of electric and strong-nuclear intrinsic\npotentials of the pure electro-strongnuclear unit-fields.\nThe physical properties of gravitoelectromagnetic-strongnuclear unit-fields are determined by the parameter x in\nthe forms (877)-(886). If a unit-field is called string, then the above-presented description of the unit-field could be\nconsidered as a model of the gravitoelectromagnetic-strongnuclear string.\nIII. UNIFIED QUANTUM MODEL OF A UNIT-FIELD (PARTICLE) IN THE EXTERNAL\nGRAVITOELECTROMAGNETIC-STRONGNUCLEAR FIELD\n\nIn order to extend the unified quantum model of a single gravitoelectromagnetic-strongnuclear unit-field to the unitfield placed into external gravitoelectromagnetic-strongnuclear field, we use the principle of additivity for potential\nenergies and potentials. The potential self-energy U0ges (r) of a single unit-field is replaced in Eqs. (852), (857) and\n\u22c6\n(864) by the total potential energy Uges\n(r) of the unit-field:\n\u22c6\nUges\n(r) = Ug\u22c6 (r) + Ue\u22c6 (r) + Us\u22c6 (r),\n\n(887)\n\nUg\u22c6 (r) = U0g (r) + Ug (r) = m0 \u03c6\u22c6g (r)\n\n(888)\n\nUe\u22c6 (r) = U0e (r) + Ue (r) = q0 \u03c6\u22c6e (r)\n\n(889)\n\nUs\u22c6 (r) = U0s (r) + Us (r) = Q0 \u03c6\u22c6s (r).\n\n(890)\n\nwith\n\nThe components Ug (r) = m0 \u03c6g (r), Ue (r) = q0 \u03c6e (r) and Us (r) = Q0 \u03c6s (r) denote respectively the gravitational,\nelectric and strong potential energies attributed to the gravitational (\u03c6g (r)), electric (\u03c6e (r)) and strong-nuclear\n(\u03c6s (r)) external potentials. The total scalar and total vector potentials are given by\n\u03c6\u22c6g (r) = \u03c60g (r) + \u03c6g (r)\n\n(891)\n\n\u03c6\u22c6e (r) = \u03c60e (r) + \u03c6e (r)\n\n(892)\n\n\u03c6\u22c6s (r) = \u03c60s (r) + \u03c6s (r)\n\n(893)\n\n\u00c2\u22c6g =\n\n\u03c6\u22c6g p\u0302\nm0 c\n\n(894)\n\n\u00c2\u22c6e =\n\n\u03c6\u22c6e p\u0302\nm0 c\n\n(895)\n\n\f175\n\u00c2\u22c6s =\n\n\u03c6\u2217s p\u0302\n.\nm0 c\n\n(896)\n\nNotice, the parameters \u03c60g (r), \u03c60e (r) and \u03c60s (r) are internal potentials. Thus the gravitoelectromagneticstrongnuclear unit-field placed into the external gravitoelectromagnetic-strongnuclear field Uges (r) = Ug (r) + Ue (r) +\nUs (r) satisfies Eqs. (851) and (855), where the squared Hamiltonian (852) and the Hamiltonians (857) and (864) are\ndescribed by the parameter x in the form\nx=\n\n2(m0 \u03c6\u22c6g + q0 \u03c6\u22c6e + Q0 \u03c6\u22c6s )\np\u03022\n+\nm20 c2\nm0 c2\n(m0 \u03c6\u22c6g + q0 \u03c6\u22c6e + Q0 \u03c6\u22c6s )2\n+\n+\nm20 c4\n2(m0 \u00c2\u22c6g + q0 \u00c2\u22c6e + Q0 \u00c2\u22c6s )p\u0302\nm20 c3\n+\n\n(m0 \u00c2\u22c6g + q0 \u00c2\u22c6e + Q0 \u00c2\u22c6s )2\n.\nm20 c4\n\n(897)\n\nThus the gravitoelectromagnetic-strongnuclear interaction of the unit-field with the external field is determined by\nthe parameter (897). The pure gravitational, pure electric (electromagnetic) and pure strong-nuclear unit-fields and\ninteractions correspond to the parameter x, which is given by Eq. (897) with \u03c6\u22c6e = \u03c6\u22c6s = 0, \u03c6\u22c6g = \u03c6\u22c6s = 0 and \u03c6\u22c6g =\n\u03c6\u22c6e = 0, respectively. The gravitoelectric (gravitoelectromagnetic), gravito-strongnuclear and electro-strongnuclear\nunit-fields and interactions are determined by the parameter (897) with \u03c6\u22c6s = 0, \u03c6\u22c6e = 0 and \u03c6\u22c6g = 0, respectively.\nThe relations (851), (855), (852), (857), (864) and (897) predict the new physical phenomena attributed to interaction (cross-correlation) of the unit-field with the external gravitoelectromagnetic-strongnuclear field. The operators \u03c60g \u03c6g and \u00c20g \u00c2g uncover the interaction mediated by means of the cross-correlation of intrinsic end external\ngravitational potentials. The terms \u03c60e \u03c6e and \u00c20e \u00c2e reveal the interaction induced by the intrinsic and external\nelectromagnetic potentials, whereas the operators \u03c60s \u03c6s and \u00c20s \u00c2s predict the interaction by the cross-correlation\nof intrinsic and external strong-nuclear potentials. The gravito-electric interaction is predicted by the operators\n\u03c6\u22c6g \u03c6\u22c6e and \u00c2\u22c6g \u00c2\u22c6e . The gravito-strongnuclear interaction is revealed by the operators \u03c6\u22c6g \u03c6\u22c6s and \u00c2\u22c6g \u00c2\u22c6s , whereas the\nelectro-strongnuclear (electro-weak ) interaction correspond to the operators \u03c6\u22c6e \u03c6\u22c6s and \u00c2\u22c6e \u00c2\u22c6s . The second order term\n\u22124\n(m0 \u03c6\u22c6g + q0n \u03c6\u22c6e )2 m\u22122\n, which does not exist in the general relativity and electromagnetism could play a key role\n0 c\nin the interactions mediated by the strong gravitational and electromagnetic potentials.\nIt is surprising that the physical picture of the interactions based on the approximation (864) of \u0124(x) under the\ncondition hxi = h\u03c8\u03030 |hs|x|si|\u03c8\u03030 i < 1 depends on the number of terms in the Taylor expansion. The terms of more\nthan second order in the potentials yielded the combined interactions, which are the high-order combinations of\ngravitational, electromagnetic, strong-nuclear, gravito-electromagnetic, gravito-strongnuclear and electro-strongnuclear\ninteractions. The interaction models based on Eqs. (864) and (857) are perturbative theories, i.e., they are described by\nexpansions in powers of hxi or hyi = h\u03c8\u03030 |hs|y|si|\u03c8\u03030 i. In the case of the relativistic unit-fields (hpi\nq \u2248 p), the condition\n\u221a\n2\nhyi < 1 is satisfied by the gravitoelectro-strongnuclear unit-fields if v < c/ 2, where p = m0 v/ 1 \u2212 vc2 is the particle\nmomentum. If the dimensionless parameters hyi or hxi are of order one or larger, then the non-perturbative theory\nbased on Eq. (852) have to be used to describe the interactions. An example of the latter is the strongnuclear and\nelectro-strongnuclear interactions, where the parameter hxi \u226b 1 due to Eq. (863).\nIV. UNIFIED QUANTUM MODEL OF MULTI-UNITFIELD SYSTEM\n\nWe now extend the single-unitfield (N = 1) model developed in the previous sections to the multi-unitfield (N \u2265 2)\nsystem. The multi-unitfield system (809), which consists of the cross-correlating gravito-electromagnetic-strongnuclear\nunit-fields \u03a80n (r, t), is described by the field\n\u03a8(r, t) =\n\nN\n\u22652\nX\n\n\u03a80n (r, t).\n\n(898)\n\nn=1\n\nThe n-th unit-field, which is surrounded by the (N \u2212 1) external unit-fields, does satisfy Eqs.

[32] that the Hamiltonians of canonical quantum mechanics [33],[34] of a system of\nelectrically charged particles are the low-order approximations of the unified Hamiltonian of the system of pure\nelectromagnetic unit-fields. The unified energy-mass relation (909) provides the minimum energy of the system only\nif no two identical electrons occupy the same quantum state.

THE CLASSICAL LIMIT OF UNIFIED QUANTUM MODEL\n\nThe physical parameters of quantum particles (unit-fields) obey the non-quantum values of classical (spin-less)\nparticles in the classical limit. That means that a physical value f determined by the respective operator f\u02c6 is given\nby\nZ \u221e\n\u03c80\u2217 (r\u2032 )f\u02c6(r\u2032 )\u03c80 (r\u2032 )d3 x\u2032 =\nf (r) = hf (r)i =\n\u2212\u221e\nZ \u221e\n\u03c1(r\u2032 )f (r\u2032 )d3 x\u2032 ,\n(913)\n\u2212\u221e\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\nwhere \u03c1(r ) = \u03b4(r \u2212 r ) denotes the Dirac delta.

Notice, the Lagrangian (930) describes these forces as different aspects of a single\ngravitoelectromagnetic-strongnuclear interaction. In other words, at very high energies, the gravitational, electro\u2202L\nmagnetic, strong-nuclear and weak-nuclear forces are combined into one. The gravitoelectromagnetic (Fge = \u2202rge )\n\u2202Lgs\nand gravito-strongnuclear (Fgs = \u2202r ) forces are the new kinds of forces, compared to SM. The fundamental forces\ncorrespond to Eqs. (935)-(937), whereas the combined forces are described by Eqs. (931)-(934). Notice, the Tailor\nexpansion in the Lagrangian (930) changes the physical picture of interactions.

DISCUSSIONS AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nStarting from the mass-energy relation of Einstein's special relativity and using the concept for the unit-fields with\ngravitational, electric, and strong-nuclear \"dressings\", the unified equations for gravitational, electromagnetic, strongnuclear, gravito-electric, gravito-strongnuclear and electro-strongnuclear (weak-nuclear) fields and interactions were\nderived. The cross-correlation of the gravitational (Ug\u22c6 ), electric (Ue\u22c6 ) and strong-nuclear (Us\u22c6 ) fields (\"dressings\") or\nthe respective potentials explain the three fundamental kinds of interactions, namely the gravitational, electric and\n\u22c6\n\u22c6\nstrong-nuclear forces. The gravito-electric (Uge\n= Ug\u22c6 + Ue\u22c6 ), gravito-strongnuclear (Ugs\n= Ug\u22c6 + Us\u22c6 ) and electro\u22c6\n\u22c6\n\u22c6\nstrongnuclear (Ues = Ue + Us ) fields are the combined \"dressings\" of the unit-field, which are responsible for the\ngravito-electric, gravito-strongnuclear and electro-strongnuclear (weak-nuclear) combined forces. The gravitational\n(Ug\u22c6 = U0g + Ug ), electric (Ue\u22c6 = U0e + Ue ) and strong-nuclear (Us\u22c6 = U0s + Us ) fields (\"dressings\") consist of the\ngravitational (U0g ), electric (U0e ), and strong-nuclear (U0s ) intrinsic fields (\"intrinsic dressings\") and the gravitational\n(Ug ), electric (Ue ), and strong-nuclear (Us ) external fields (\"external dressings\"). The total rest-mass hm0ges i of the\ngravitoelectric-strongnuclear \"intrinsic dressing\" U0ges of the unit-field, which is given by\nhm0ges i = hm0g i + hm0e i + hm0s i =\nhs|(U0g c\u22122 )|si + hs|(U0e c\u22122 )|si\n+hs|(U0s c\u22122 )|si,\n\n(942)\n\nconsists of the gravitational (hm0g i), electric (hm0e i) and strong-nuclear (hm0s i) masses of the gravitational (U0g ),\nelectric (U0g ) and strong-nuclear (U0g ) \"intrinsic dressings\" (intrinsic fields). In terms of SM, the gravitoelectricstrongnuclear unit-field carries the intrinsic gauge-bosons associated with the respective \"intrinsic dressings\". The\ngravitonal, electric, strong-nuclear, gravito-electric, gravito-strongnuclear and electro-strongnuclear (electroweak) intrinsic gouge-bosons have the masses hm0g i, hm0e i, hm0s i, hm0ge i = hm0g i + hm0e i, hm0gs i = hm0g i + hm0s i and\nhm0es i = hm0s i + hm0e i, respectively.\nThe physical picture of quantum interactions is determined by the unit-field state |si|\u03c8\u0303i, the squared Hamiltonian \u01242 (x) and the Hamiltonians \u0124(x) and \u0124(y). The model predicts gravitational, electromagnetic, strongnuclear, gravito-electromagnetic, gravito-strongnuclear and electro-strongnuclear (weak-nuclear) quantum interactions\ndescribed by the dimensionless quantum parameters (878)-(880) and (884)-(886). If the dimensionless parameter\nhyi = h\u03c8\u03030 |hs|y|si|\u03c8\u03030 i or hxi = h\u03c8\u03030 |hs|x|si|\u03c8\u03030 i is of order one or larger, then the quantum interactions are described by\nthe non-perturbative theory based on Eq. (852). The quantum models based on Eqs. (857) and (864) are perturbative\ntheories, i.e., they are described by expansions in powers of hyi or hxi. The physical picture of quantum interactions\nbased on the approximation (864) of \u0124(x) under the condition hxi < 1 depends on the number of terms in the Taylor\nexpansion. The terms of more than second order in the potentials yielded the combined quantum interactions, which\nare the high-order combinations of gravitational, electromagnetic, strong-nuclear, gravito-electromagnetic, gravitostrongnuclear and electro-strongnuclear interactions. In terms of SM, the interaction of unit-fields is provided by the\nvirtual (U \u22c6 = U \u22c6 (r)) or real (U \u22c6 = U \u22c6 (r, t)) exchange of the virtual or real gauge-bosons, respectively. For instance,\n\n\f181\nthe real gravitons, real photons, electro-strong (electroweak) real bosons and strong-nuclear real bosons (real gluons)\nare the real gauge-bosons associated with the gravitational (Ug\u22c6 (r, t)), electric (Ug\u22c6 (r, t)), strong-nuclear (Ug\u22c6 (r, t)),\n\u22c6\n\u22c6\ngravito-electric (Uge\n(r, t) = Ug\u22c6 (r, t) + Ue\u22c6 (r, t)), gravito-strongnuclear (Ugs\n(r, t) = Ug\u22c6 (r, t) + Us\u22c6 (r, t)) and electro\u22c6\n\u22c6\n\u22c6\nstrongnuclear (Ues (r, t) = Ue (r, t) + Us (r, t)) intrinsic and external fields (\"intrinsic and external dressings\"). In\nother words, the interaction of unit-fields is provided by exchange of the \"intrinsic dressings\" (virtual or real intrinsic\ngauge-bosons) or \"external dressings\" (virtual or real external gauge-bosons).\nIn the standard model of particle physics, the relative strengths of the four fundamental (gravitational, electromagnetic, strong-nuclear and weak-nuclear) forces are quoted in terms of the respective dimensionless coupling constants\nF\n\u03b3 m2\n\u03b3e q02\n, \u03b1g = \u03b1e Fge = \u03b1e \u03b3ge q20 . The experimen\u03b1g , \u03b1e , \u03b1s and \u03b1w . The coupling constants \u03b1g and \u03b1e are given by \u03b1e = \u0127c\n0\ntal data describing the strong-nuclear (color) force between nucleons is consistent with the value \u03b1s \u223c 1. SM sees the\ncolor force as the force between the constituent quarks. The quantum chromodynamics of SM describing the color\nforce gives the well-known expression for the strong-nuclear coupling constant:\n\u03b1s (\u03b5) \u2248\n\n12\u03c0\n(33 \u2212 2nq )ln\n\n\u03b52\n\u039b2\n\n\u0001,\n\n(943)\n\nwhere nq is the number of quarks, \u03b5 denotes the energy, and \u039b \u2248 0.2GeV is experimentally determined parameter.\nEquation (943) shows that the strong force coupling constant decreases to zero (\u03b1s (\u03b5) \u2192 0) at small distances (r \u2192 0,\nrespectively \u03b5 \u2192 \u221e), i.e., the quarks approach a state where they can move without resistance in the tiny volume of\nthe hadron. In other words, the color force diminishes inside the nucleons. The phenomenon is called the \"asymptotic\nfreedom\" of quarks. In the quantum picture of SM, the nuclear strong force between quarks is based on exchange of\ngluons. The color force acts like a spring between quarks of different colors, becoming stronger as they get farther\napart. That explained why quarks cannot be isolated singularly. According to SM, the weak-nuclear coupling constant\n\u03b1w is related to the strong-nuclear \u03b1s coupling constant as \u03b1w /\u03b1s \u2248 10\u22127 . SM describes the electromagnetic force\nand the weak-nuclear force as two different aspects of a single electroweak interaction. At very high energies, SM\ncombines the electromagnetic and weak forces into one.\nIn the unified model, the counterparts of the coupling constants of SM are the unified dimensionless coupling\nparameters (see, Eqs.

For\ninstance, the strong-nuclear force between two quarks with the color charges Q1 and Q2 , which is described by\nEq. (834), (930) and (937), reads\n\u2202Us\n\u2202Ls\n=\u2212\n= \u2212\u03b3s Q1 Q2\nFs =\n\u2202r \u0012 \u2202r\n\u0015\n\u0014\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0013\n|\u0393s |\n|\u0393s |\n1\n1\n+ 2 e\u2212|\u0393s |r \u2212\n\u2212 2 e|\u0393s |r .\nr\nr\nr\nr\n\n(948)\n\n\u221a\nHere, we considered the quarks at rest (v = 0). The strong-nuclear force (948) diminishes at the distance r \u2248 3|\u0393s |\u22121\nbetween the quarks independently from the color charge\u221a Q. That means that the quarks move freely (Fs \u223c 0)\nwithin the hadrons, whose dimensions are given by r \u223c 3|\u0393s |\u22121 . Like in SM, the quark color charges have three\nkinds. Antiquarks come with the anti-color charges. At large distance between quarks, Eq. (948) yields the force\n2 |\u0393s | |\u0393s |r\ne\nwhich increases infinitely with the increase of r. In case of Qi Qj = (\u22121 + 2\u03b4ij )|Qi ||Qj |, the\nFs \u2248 \u03b3s Q1 Q\nr\n\n\f182\nquarks of different colors attract each other, and the quarks of the same color repel each other. That explains why\nthe attractive quarks are apparently inseparable, though they can move freely when they are close together. The\nattractive quarks are elementary particles from which nucleons (protons and neutrons) are composed. Like in SM, a\nneutron, proton or any other three-quark particle have one of each color to exist. In the present model, the electroweak (electro-strongnuclear) force between two unit-fields (particles) with the electric charges q1 and q2 and the color\ncharges Q1 and Q2 , which is described by Eq. (830), (834), (934) and (937), reads\n\u2202Les\n=\n\u2202r\ns\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u2202\nv2\n2\n\u2212\n(m0 c2 + hm0es ic2 + Ues (r)) 1 \u2212 2 .\n\u2202r\nc\nFew =\n\n(949)\n\n2\nThe parameters Ues\n(r) = Ue2 (r) + 2Ue (r)Us (r) + Us2 (r) and Ue (r)Us (r) in Eq. (949) explain the electro-weak (electrostrongnuclear) force. Notice, Eq. (949) describes the electromagnetic force and the weak-nuclear force as two different\ne\naspects of a single electroweak interaction. Indeed, at very high energies, the electromagnetic (Fe = \u2202L\n\u2202r ) and strong\n\u2202Ls\n\u2202Les\nFs = \u2202r forces are combined into the electro-weak force Few = \u2202r .\nThe role of the unit-field spin wave-functions in the interactions is described rather by the quantum equations of\nSects. I-V than the non-quantum equations of Sect. VI. For an orbital quantum number l, there are 2l+1 independent\nspin wavefunctions (837), one for each magnetic quantum number m with \u2212l \u2264 m \u2264 l (see, Sec. II.A.2). It was shown\nthat the electron corresponds to the unit-field with the orbital and magnetic quantum numbers l = 1 and m = \u00b11,\nwhich yielded the well-known normal and anomalous values of the electron magnetic moment. [32]. For other particles,\nthe values of l and m are determined by the experimental data and SM. Notice, the spin wave-functions s(r) and\n\u2212s(r) of a particle and antiparticle provide their annihilation.\nThe present model has explained the weak-nuclear interaction (force) by the cross-correlation of electric and strongnuclear potentials of the electric and strong-nuclear \"dressings\". The cross-correlations of gravitational potential\nwith the electric and strong-nuclear potentials predict the existence of new forces, namely gravito-electromagnetic\nand gravito-strongnuclear interactions, which are unknown in SM. Keeping terms of more than second order in the\npotentials of perturbative model (864) uncovers other combinations of gravitational, electromagnetic, weak-nuclear\nand strong-nuclear interactions. The unified model is surprisingly simple in comparison to the Maxwell-Lorentz\nelectrodynamics, Einstein relativity, quantum mechanics, and SM. The unified model may be useful in other branches\nof physics, especially in the case of strong gravitational, electric and strong-nuclear potentials. As an example, the\nnew aspects of the physics of cosmological black-holes, solid-state physics, near-field optics and photonics based on\nthe unified model will be presented in the next paper.\n\n[1] M.
