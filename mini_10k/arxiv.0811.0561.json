But\nunfortunately some of these techniques from representation theory are not well-known\nto people working in number theory.\nSeveral times recently, we ran into Auslander-Reiten sequences in our work and we\nbegan to appreciate the power and elegance of these sequences. These sequences are\nsome special non-split short exact sequences which are very close to being split sequences.\nThey were introduced by Auslander and Reiten in the early 70s [AR75], and they have\nbeen among the most important tools from modular representation theory.\nThe goal of this article is to introduce Auslander-Reiten sequences and to give some\napplications. This article is by no means a historical survey of Auslander-Reiten theory;\nit focuses only on some selective applications from our recent joint work. The treatment\nhere will be particularly suitable for homotopy theorists and number theorists. We\nhope that the readers who are not specialists in representation theory might be inspired\nfurther to learn more about Auslander-Reiten sequences and investigate possible Galois\nfield theoretic applications.\nWe would like to thank the referee for his/her valuable suggestions which have helped\nus to improve the exposition of our paper\n2. Auslander-Reiten sequences\nThroughout we let G denote a finite group and k a field of characteristic p that\ndivides the order of G. We denote by \u039b the group algebra kG. Although AuslanderReiten theory is often studied in the broader context of Artin algebras, for simplicity\nwe restrict ourselves to the most interesting case of group algebras.\nDefinition 2.1. A short exact sequence of \u039b-modules\n\u01eb:\n\n\u03b2\n\n\u03b1\n\n0 \u2212\u2192 M \u2212\u2192 E \u2212\u2192 N \u2212\u2192 0\n\nis an Auslander-Reiten (AR) sequence if the following three conditions are satisfied:\n\u2022 \u01eb is a non-split sequence.\n\u2022 \u03b1 is left almost split, i.e., any map \u03c6 : M \u2192 M \u2032 that is not a split monomorphism\nfactors through E via \u03b1.\n\u2022 \u03b2 is right almost split, i.e., any map \u03c8 : N \u2032 \u2192 N that is not a split epimorphism\nfactors through E via \u03b2.\nN\u2032\n\u03c8\n\n0\n\n/M\n\n\u03b1\n\n/E\n\n~\n\n\u03b2\n\n\u000f\n/N\n\n/0\n\n\u03c6\n\n\u000f ~\nM\u2032\nThere are several other equivalent definitions of an Auslander-Reiten sequence. The\none we have given here is perhaps the most symmetric of all. Note that a split short\nexact sequence satisfies the last two conditions. This justifies why Auslander-Reiten\nsequences are also called almost split sequences. Further, we note that these conditions\nalso imply that the terms M and N in an AR sequence have to be indecomposable and\nnon-projective.\n\n\fAUSLANDER-REITEN SEQUENCES\n\n3\n\nExample 2.2. (One-up and One-down) Let us start with a very simple example. Let\n\u039b = k[x]/xp where p is the characteristic of k. Observe that \u039b is a group algebra kG\nwith a G cyclic group of order p. Then for each integer i strictly between 0 and p, the\nshort exact sequence\n(j,\u2212\u03c0)\n\n0 \u2212\u2192 k[x]/xi \u2212\u2192 k[x]/xi+1 \u2295 k[x]/xi\u22121 \u2212\u2192 k[x]/xi \u2212\u2192 0\nis easily shown (exercise left to the reader) to be an Auslander-Reiten sequence. Here j\nis the obvious injection into the first summand of the middle term, and \u03c0 is the obvious\nsurjection on the second summand.\nThe remarkable result is the existence of these sequences:\nTheorem 2.3. [ARS95] Given any indecomposable non-projective \u039b-module N , there\nexists a unique (up to isomorphism of short exact sequences) Auslander-Reiten sequence\n\u01eb ending in N . Moreover the first term M of the AR-sequence \u01eb is isomorphic to \u03a92 N .\nIn Section 4 we present a non-standard proof due to Krause of the existence of AR\nsequences. This uses the Brown representability theorem from algebraic topology. For\nnow, we assume existence and show uniqueness.\nSuppose we have two AR-sequences ending in an indecomposable non-projective kGmodule L:\n\u03b2\n\u03b1\n0 \u2212\u2192 M \u2212\u2192 E \u2212\u2192 L \u2212\u2192 0\n\u03b2\u2032\n\n\u03b1\u2032\n\n0 \u2212\u2192 M \u2032 \u2212\u2192 E \u2032 \u2212\u2192 L \u2212\u2192 0\n\nThe defining property of AR sequences then gives the following commutative diagram.\n0\n\n/M\n\n\u03b2\n\n\u03b1\n\n/E\n\n\u03b1\u2032\n\n\u000f\n/ E\u2032\n\n\u03b2\u2032\n\n\u000f\n/L\n\n0\n\n\u03b1\n\n\u000f\n/E\n\n\u03b2\n\n\u000f\n/L\n\ng\n\n0\n\n\u000f\n/M\n\n/0\n\n=\n\nf\n\n\u000f\n/ M\u2032\n\n/L\n\n/0\n\n=\n\n/0\n\nThe composite \u03c6 := gf cannot be nilpotent, otherwise \u03b2 would be a split epimorphism.\n(This is an easy diagram-chase exercise.) Now since M is a module of finite length, for\nsufficiently large values of n, we must have\nM\u223c\n= Im(\u03c6n ) \u2295 Ker(\u03c6n ).\n\n\u223c Im(\u03c6n ) and\nSince M is indecomposable, and \u03c6 is not nilpotent, it follows that M =\n0 = Ker(\u03c6n ). This shows that \u03c6n , and hence \u03c6, is an isomorphism. Therefore f is\nthe left inverse of g. Interchanging the roles of the two AR-sequences above, it follows\nsimilarly that f is the right inverse of g. Thus we have M \u223c\n= M \u2032 . The five lemma\n\u2032\n\u223c\nnow tells us that E = E . Thus the two AR-sequences are isomorphic as short exact\nsequences.\n\n\f4\n\nSUNIL K. CHEBOLU AND J\u00c1N MIN\u00c1\u010c\n\n\u2217\n\n3. Stable module category\nWe now introduce the stable module category. We will work mostly in this category\nfor the first half of the paper. The stable module category StMod(kG) of G is the category obtained from the category Mod(kG) of (left) kG-modules by killing the projective\nmodules. More precisely, it is the category whose objects are kG-modules and whose\nmorphisms are equivalence classes of kG-module homomorphisms, where two homomorphisms are equivalent if their difference factors through a projective module (such a map\nis called projective). If M and N are two kG-modules, then we write HomkG (M, N ) for\nthe k-vector space of maps between M and N in the stable module category. It is easy to\nsee that a kG-module is projective if and only if it is the zero object in StMod(kG). The\ncompact stable category stmod(kG) is the full subcategory of StMod(kG) consisting of\nthe finitely generated (equivalently, finite-dimensional) kG-modules.\nThe category StMod(kG) admits a natural tensor triangulated structure which we\nnow explain. If M is a kG-module then define its desuspension \u03a9 M to be the kernel\nof a surjective map from a projective module to M . By Schanuel's Lemma, the new\nmodule thus obtained is well-defined up to projective summands and therefore defines\nan endofunctor\n\u03a9 : StMod(kG) \u2212\u2192 StMod(kG).\n\nUsing the fact that kG is a Frobenius algebra (injectives and projective coincide) one\ncan show that \u03a9 is an equivalence. The inverse functor \u03a9\u22121 sends M to the cokernel of\nan injective map from M to an injective module. This allows one to talk about negative\npowers of \u03a9.\nThe importance of the stable module category can be seen in the following useful and\nwell-known fact.\nProposition 3.1. Let M and N be kG-modules. If n is any positive integer, then\nHom (\u03a9n M, N ) \u223c\n= Ext n (M, N ) \u223c\n= Hom (M, \u03a9\u2212n N ).\nkG\n\nkG\n\nkG\n\nIn particular, group cohomology is elegantly encoded in the stable module category.\nIn fact, allowing n to be any integer, one recovers the Tate cohomology ring of G in\nthis way as the (graded) ring of self maps of the trivial representation. Under this\nisomorphism, the multiplication in the Tate ring of G corresponds to composition in\nHom(\u03a9\u2217 k, k).\nNow we describe the triangles in the stable module category. These arise from short\nexact sequences in the module category in the following way. Suppose\n0 \u2212\u2192 L \u2212\u2192 M \u2212\u2192 N \u2212\u2192 0\nis a short exact sequence of kG-modules. This short exact sequence determines a unique\nclass in Ext1kG (N, L) which under the isomorphism given in the above proposition corresponds to a map N \u2192 \u03a9\u22121 L. Thus we get a diagram\nL \u2212\u2192 M \u2212\u2192 N \u2212\u2192 \u03a9\u22121 L. (\u2217)\n\nA triangle in StMod(kG) is any such diagram which is isomorphic to a diagram which\narises as above (*). These triangles and the suspension functor satisfy the standard\naxioms for a triangulated category; see [Car96] for example.\nThe tensor product of two kG-modules (with diagonal G-action on the tensor product\nof k-vector spaces) descends to a well-behaved tensor product in the stable module\n\n\fAUSLANDER-REITEN SEQUENCES\n\n5\n\ncategory. (This follows from the fact that if M and N are kG-modules with either M\nor N projective, then M \u2297k N is projective.) The trivial representation k of G serves\nas a unit for the tensor product.\n4. Krause's proof of the existence of AR sequences\nThe proof of the existence of an Auslander-Reiten sequence can be found in [ARS95].\nWe present a different avatar of Auslander-Reiten sequences in the stable module category, and prove their existence following Krause [Kra00].\n\u03b2\n\n\u03b1\n\n\u03b3\n\nDefinition 4.1. A triangle A \u2212\u2192 B \u2212\u2192 C \u2212\u2192 \u03a9\u22121 A in StMod(kG) is an AuslanderReiten triangle if the following three conditions hold.\n\u2022 \u03b3 6= 0.\n\u2022 Every map f : A \u2212\u2192 A\u2032 which is not a section factors through \u03b1.\n\u2022 Every map g : C \u2032 \u2212\u2192 C which is not a retraction factors through \u03b2.\nThe following theorem is crucial in what follows. This is the Brown representability\ntheorem for StMod(kG).\nTheorem 4.2. (Brown) A contravariant functor F : StMod(kG) \u2212\u2192 Ab that is exact\nand sends coproducts to products is representable, i.e., there exists a module MF in\nStMod(kG) such that\nF (\u2212) \u223c\n= HomkG (\u2212, MF ).\nNow fix a finitely generated non-projective kG-module Z that has a local endomorphism ring, and set \u0393 = HomkG (Z, Z). Let I be the injective envelope of \u0393/rad \u0393.\nConsider the functor\nHom\u0393 (HomkG (Z, \u2212), I).\n\nIt is not hard to see that this is a contravariant functor that is exact and sends coproducts\nto products. So by the Brown representability theorem this functor is representable:\n\u223c Hom (\u2212, TZ I).\n(4.1)\n\u03a8 : Hom\u0393 (Hom (Z, \u2212), I) =\nkG\n\nkG\n\n\u03c0\n\nFinally consider the composite \u03c9 : \u0393 \u2212\u2192 \u0393/rad \u0393 \u0592\u2192 I, and denote by \u03b3 the map\n\u03a8(\u03c9). Note that \u03b3 is a map from Z \u2212\u2192 TZ I. Extending this map to a triangle in\nStMod(kG), we get\n\u03b3\n\u03a9TZ I \u2212\u2192 Y \u2212\u2192 Z \u2212\u2192 TZ I.\n\u03b2\n\n\u03b1\n\n\u03b3\n\nTheorem 4.3 ([Kra00]). The triangle \u03a9TZ I \u2212\u2192 Y \u2212\u2192 Z \u2212\u2192 TZ I is an AuslanderReiten triangle.\nProof. \u03b3 6= 0: Recall that \u03b3 = \u03a8(\u03c9), where \u03a8 is an isomorphism of functors, and \u03c9 is a\nnon-zero map. Therefore \u03b3 6= 0.\n\u03b2 has the right almost split property: That is, given a map \u03c1 : Z \u2032 \u2212\u2192 Z that is not a\nretraction, we have to show that there exists a map \u03c1\u2032 : Z \u2032 \u2212\u2192 Y making the following\ndiagram commutative.\nZ\u2032\n\u03c1\u2032\n\n\u03a9TZ I\n\n/Y\n\n~\n\n\u03c1\n\n\u000f\n/Z\n\n\u03b3\n\n/ TZ I\n\n\f6\n\nSUNIL K. CHEBOLU AND J\u00c1N MIN\u00c1\u010c\n\n\u2217\n\nFor this, it is enough to know that \u03b3\u03c1 = 0, since the bottom row in the above diagram is\n\u03c1\u2217\nan exact triangle. Since \u03c1 is not a retraction, Im HomkG (Z, Z \u2032 ) \u2212\u2192 HomkG (Z, Z) = \u0393\ndoes not contain the identity map. Consequently Im(\u03c1\u2217 ) is contained in rad \u0393.\nThe naturality of the isomorphism \u03a8 yields the following commutative diagram.\nHom\u0393 (HomkG (Z, Z), I)\n\u000f\nHom\u0393 (HomkG (Z, Z \u2032 ), I)\n\n\u223c\n=\n\n/ Hom (Z, TZ I)\nkG\n\u000f\n/ HomkG (Z \u2032 , TZ I)\n\n\u223c\n=\n\nNote that \u03c9 maps to zero under the left vertical map and by the commutativity of the\ndiagram, we see that \u03b3 also maps to zero under the right vertical map. Thus \u03b3\u03c1 = 0, as\ndesired.\n\u03b1 has the left almost split property: For this, it turns out that it suffices to show\nthat HomkG (Tz I, TZ I) is a local ring; see [Kra00] for details.\nHom (Tz I, TZ I) \u223c\n= Hom\u0393 (Hom (Z, TZ I), I)\nkG\n\nkG\n\n\u223c\n=\n\u223c\n=\n\nHom\u0393 (Hom\u0393 (HomkG (Z, Z), I), I)\nHom\u0393 (Hom\u0393 (\u0393, I), I)\n\n\u223c\n=\n\nHom\u0393 (I, I)\n\nThe injective \u0393-module I is indecomposable since \u0393/rad \u0393 is simple, and therefore\nHom\u0393 (I, I) is a local ring. So we are done.\n\u0003\n5. Auslander-Reiten duality\nThe isomorphism given in eq. 4.1 is just another avatar of Auslander-Reiten duality\nwhich we now explain. Let M and L be finitely generated kG-modules. Then the\nAuslander-Reiten duality says that there is a non-degenerate bilinear form (functorial\nin both variables)\n\u03a6(\u2212, \u2212) : HomkG (L, \u03a9M ) \u00d7 HomkG (M, L) \u2212\u2192 k.\nTo explain this pairing, first recall that \u03a9M is defined by the short exact sequence\nj\n\nq\n\n0 \u2212\u2192 \u03a9M \u2212\u2192 P \u2212\u2192 M \u2212\u2192 0,\nwhere P is a minimal projective cover of M . Given f : L \u2192 \u03a9M and g : M \u2192 L, we\nthen get the following diagram.\n/P\nO\n\nP\nq\n\n\u000f\nM\n\nj\ng\n\n/L\n\nf\n\n/ \u03a9M\n\nThe top horizontal self map of P is in the image of the norm map \u03b7 : Endk P \u2192 EndkG P\nP\nwhich sends \u03c6 to g\u2208G g * \u03c6. Now we define \u03a6(f, g) = tr(\u03b8), where \u03b7(\u03b8) = jf gq.\nTo see the connection between the Auslander-Reiten sequence and the natural isomorphism 4.1 which was responsible for the existence of Auslander-Reiten triangles,\nconsider the special case of Auslander-Reiten duality when M = k. This gives a pairing\n(natural in L):\nHomkG (L, \u03a9k) \u00d7 HomkG (k, L) \u2212\u2192 k.\n\n\fAUSLANDER-REITEN SEQUENCES\n\n7\n\nOr equivalently, a natural isomorphism of functors\nHomk (Hom (k, \u2212), k) \u223c\n= Hom\n\nkG (\u2212, \u03a9k)\n\nkG\n\nThis is precisely the isomorphism 4.1 when Z = k. Since the representing object is\nunique, we get Tk I = \u03a9k. Thus the Auslander-Reiten triangle ending in k has the form\n\u03a92 k \u2212\u2192 M \u2212\u2192 k \u2212\u2192 \u03a9k.\nIn the next three sections we give three different applications of Auslander-Reiten\nsequences from our recent work.\n6. Representations of V4 -modules\nConsider the Klein four group V4 = C2 \u2295 C2 . We use AR sequences to prove the\nfollowing intriguing result which also plays a crucial role in the proof of the classification\nof the indecomposable V4 representations.\nTheorem 6.1. Let M be a projective-free V4 -module. Then we have the following.\n(1) If l is the smallest positive integer such that \u03a9l (k) is isomorphic to a submodule\nof M , then \u03a9l (k) is a summand of M .\n(2) Dually, if l is the smallest positive integer such that \u03a9\u2212l (k) is isomorphic to a\nquotient module of M , then \u03a9\u2212l (k) is a summand of M .\nProof. First note that the second part of this lemma follows by dualising the first part;\nhere we also use the fact that (\u03a9l k)\u2217 \u223c\n= \u03a9\u2212l k. So it is enough to prove the first part.\nThe AR sequences in the category of kV4 -modules are of the form (see [Ben84, Appendix, p 180]):\n0 \u2192 \u03a9l+2 k \u2192 \u03a9l+1 k \u2295 \u03a9l+1 k \u2192 \u03a9l k \u2192 0\n1\n\n0 \u2192 \u03a9 k \u2192 kV4 \u2295 k \u2295 k \u2192 \u03a9\n\n\u22121\n\nl 6= \u22121\n\nk\u21920\n\nTo prove the first part of the above lemma, let l be the smallest positive integer such\nthat \u03a9l k embeds in a projective-free V4 -module M . If this embedding does not split,\nthen by the property of an almost split sequence, it should factor through \u03a9l\u22121 k\u2295\u03a9l\u22121 k\nas shown in the diagram below.\n0\n\n/ \u03a9l \u007f k\n_\n\u000f w\nM\n\n/ \u03a9l\u22121 k \u2295 \u03a9l\u22121 k\n\n/ \u03a9l\u22122 k\n\n/0\n\nf \u2295g\n\nNow if either f or g is injective, that would contradict the minimality of l, so they\ncannot be injective.

It is not hard to see that the invariant submodule (\u03a9l k)G of\n\u03a9l k maps into ((kV4 )s )G . We will arrive at a contradiction by showing ((kV4 )s )G maps\nto zero under the map \u03c6. Since ((kV4 )s )G \u223c\n= ((kV4 )G )s it is enough to show that \u03c6 maps\nG\nG\neach (kV4 ) to zero. (kV4 ) is a one-dimensional subspace, generated by an element\nwhich we denote as v. If v maps to a non-zero element, then it is easy to see that the\nrestriction of \u03c6 on the corresponding copy of kV4 is injective, but M is projective-free, so\nthis is impossible. In other words \u03c6(v) = 0 and that completes the proof of the lemma.\n\u0003\n7. Tate cohomology\nRecall that the Tate cohomology of G with coefficients in a module M is given by\n\u2217\n\u0124 (G, M ) = HomkG (\u03a9\u2217 k, M ). In our recent joint work with Jon Carlson we focused on\ntwo fundamental questions ([CCM07b] and [CCM07a]) about Tate cohomology which\n\n\fAUSLANDER-REITEN SEQUENCES\n\n9\n\nwe discuss in the next two subsections. As we shall see, Auslander-Reiten sequences\nplay an important role in answering both of these questions.\n7.1. Modules with finitely generated Tate cohomology. Let M be a finitely generated kG-module. A well-known result of Evens-Venkov states that the ordinary cohomology H \u2217 (G, M ) is finitely generated as a module over H \u2217 (G, k). So it is a very\nnatural question to investigate whether the same is true for Tate cohomology. That\n\u2217\n\u2217\nis, whether \u0124 (G, M ) is finitely generated as a module over \u0124 (G, k). As shown in\n[CCM07b] Tate cohomology is seldom finitely generated. However, there is an interesting family of modules arising from AR sequences whose Tate cohomology is finitely\ngenerated.\nTo start, let N be a finitely generated indecomposable non-projective kG-module\nthat is not isomorphic to \u03a9i k for any i. Consider the Auslander-Reiten sequence\n0 \u2212\u2192 \u03a92 N \u2212\u2192 M \u2212\u2192 N \u2212\u2192 0\nending in N . Assume that N has finitely generated Tate cohomology, then we shall see\nthat the middle term M also has finitely generated Tate cohomology.\nConsider the connecting map \u03c6 : N \u2212\u2192 \u03a9N in the exact triangle\n\u03c6\n\n\u03a92 N \u2212\u2192 M \u2212\u2192 N \u2212\u2192 \u03a9N\ncorresponding to the above Auslander-Reiten sequence. We first argue that \u03c6 induces\nthe zero map in Tate cohomology. To this end, let f : \u03a9i k \u2192 N be an arbitrary map. We\nf\n\u03c6\nwant to show that the composite \u03a9i k \u2192 N \u2192 \u03a9N is zero in the stable category. Now\nobserve that the assumption on N implies that f is not a split retraction, therefore the\nmap f factors through the middle term M . Since the composition of any two successive\nmaps in an exact triangle is zero, it follows that \u03c6f = 0.\nSince the boundary map \u03c6 induces the zero map in Tate cohomology, the resulting\nlong exact sequence in Tate cohomology breaks into short exact sequences:\n\u2217\n\n\u2217\n\n\u2217\n\n0 \u2212\u2192 \u0124 (G, \u03a92 N ) \u2212\u2192 \u0124 (G, M ) \u2212\u2192 \u0124 (G, N ) \u2212\u2192 0.\nIt is now clear that if N has finitely generated Tate cohomology, then so does M .\nIn [CCM07b] we have also shown that the middle term of the AR sequence ending\nin k has finitely generated Tate cohomology.\nThese results imply that if we have a sequence of finitely generated indecomposable\nnon-projective kG-modules\nN1 , N2 , * * * , Ns , s \u2208 N\n\u2217\n\n\u2217\n\nsuch that \u0124 (G, N1 ) is finitely generated as a module over \u0124 (G, k) and Ni+1 is a\nsummand of a middle term of the Auslander-Reiten sequence which ends in Ni , 1 \u2264 i < s,\n\u2217\n\u2217\nthen all modules \u0124 (G, Ni ) are finitely generated over \u0124 (G, k).\n\n7.2. Counterexamples to Freyd's generating hypothesis. Motivated by the celebrated generating hypothesis (GH) of Peter Freyd in homotopy theory [Fre66] and its\nanalogue in the derived category of a commutative ring [HLP07, Loc07], we have formulated in [CCM07a] the analogue of Freyd's GH in the stable module category stmod(kG)\nof a finite group G, where k is a field of characteristic p. This is the statement that the\nTate cohomology functor detects trivial maps (maps that factor through a projective\n\n\f10\n\nSUNIL K. CHEBOLU AND J\u00c1N MIN\u00c1\u010c\n\n\u2217\n\nmodule) in the thick subcategory generated by k. We studied the GH and related questions in special cases in a series of papers: [CCM08a, BCCM07, CCM08b, CCM07c].\nWe have finally settled the GH for the stable module category in joint work with Jon\nCarlson. The main result of [CCM07a] is:\nTheorem 7.1. [CCM07a] The generating hypothesis holds for kG if and only if the\nSylow p-subgroup of G is either C2 or C3 .\nMaps in the thick subcategory generated by k that induce the zero map in Tate\ncohomology are called ghosts. Thus non-trivial ghosts give counterexamples to the GH.\nAfter much research on this, we were led to a big revelation when we discovered that a\ngood source of non-trivial ghosts come from Auslander-Reiten sequences.\nTo explain this in more detail, consider an AR sequence\n0 \u2212\u2192 \u03a92 N \u2212\u2192 B \u2212\u2192 N \u2212\u2192 0\nending in N . This short exact sequence represents a exact triangle\n\u03c6\n\n\u03a92 N \u2212\u2192 B \u2212\u2192 N \u2212\u2192 \u03a9N\nin the stable category. We will show that the map \u03c6 : N \u2212\u2192 \u03a9N is a non-trivial\nghost. First of all, AR sequences are, by definition, non-split short exact sequences, and\ntherefore the boundary map \u03c6 in the above triangle must be a non-trivial map in the\nstable category. The next thing to be shown is that the map \u03c6 : N \u2212\u2192 \u03a9N induces\ni\nd (k, \u2212) for all i. Arguing as in\nthe zero map on the functors HomkG (\u03a9i k, \u2212) \u223c\n= Ext\nsection 7.1, consider any map f : \u03a9i k \u2212\u2192 N . We have to show that the composite\nf\n\n\u03c6\n\n\u03a9i k \u2212\u2192 N \u2212\u2192 \u03a9N\nis trivial in the stable category. Consider the following diagram\n\u03a9i k\nf\n\n\u03a92 N\n\n/B\n\n~\n\n\u000f\n/N\n\n\u03c6\n\n/ \u03a9N\n\nwhere the bottom row is our exact triangle. The map f : \u03a9i k \u2212\u2192 N cannot be a split\nepimorphism if we choose N to be an indecomposable non-projective module in the\nthick subcategory generated by k that is not isomorphic to \u03a9i k for any i. Then by the\ndefining property of an AR sequence, the map f factors through the middle term B as\nshown in the above diagram. Since the composite of any two successive maps in a exact\ntriangle is zero, the composite \u03c6\u25e6 f is also zero by commutativity. Thus the moral of the\nstory is that in order to disprove the GH for kG, we just have to find an indecomposable\nnon-projective module in the thick subcategory generated by k that is not isomorphic\nto \u03a9i k for any i. This was the strategy we used to disprove the GH for kG when the\nSylow p-subgroup has order at least 4.\n8. Galois theoretic connections\nIn this section we provide the motivation for some of the arithmetic objects which will\nappear in the later sections when we study Auslander-Reiten sequences in the context\nof Galois theory. To set the stage, we begin with our notation.\n\n\fAUSLANDER-REITEN SEQUENCES\n\n11\n\nLet F be a field of characteristic not equal to 2 and let Fsep denote the separable\nclosure of F . We shall introduce several subextensions of Fsep .\n\u2022 F (2) = compositum of all quadratic extensions of F .\n\u2022 F (3) = compositum of all quadratic extensions of F (2) , which are Galois over\nF.\n\u2022 F {3} = compositum of all quadratic extensions of F (2) .\n\u2022 Fq = compositum of all Galois extensions K/F such that [K : F ] = 2n , for some\npositive integer n.\nAll of these subextensions are Galois and they fit in a tower\nF \u2282 F (2) \u2282 F (3) \u2282 F {3} \u2282 Fq \u2282 Fsep .\nWe denote their Galois groups (over F ) as\n{3}\n\n[3]\n\n[2]\n\nGF \u2212\u2192 Gq \u2212\u2192 GF \u2212\u2192 GF (= GF ) \u2212\u2192 GF (= E) \u2212\u2192 1.\nQ\n[2]\nObserve that GF is just\nC2 , where I is the dimension of F \u2217 /F \u2217 2 over F2 . F \u2217\ni\u2208I\n\ndenotes the multiplicative subgroup of F . GF is the absolute Galois group of F . The\nabsolute Galois group of fields are in general rather mysterious objects of great interest.\n(See [BLMS07] for restrictions on the possible structure of absolute Galois groups.) Although the quotients Gq are much simpler we are far from understanding their structure\nin general. F {3} and its Galois group over F are considerably much simpler and yet\nthey already contain substantial arithmetic information of the absolute Galois group.\nTo illustrate this point, consider W F the Witt ring of quadratic forms; see [Lam05]\nfor the definition. Then we have the following theorem.\nTheorem 8.1. [MS96] Let F and L be two fields of characteristic not 2. Then W F \u223c\n=\nW L (as rings) implies that GF \u223c\n= GL as pro-2-groups. Further if we\u221aassume additionally\nin the case when each element of F is a sum of two squares that \u22121 \u2208 F if and only\n\u221a\nif \u22121 \u2208 L, then GF \u223c\n= GL implies W F \u223c\n= W L.\nThus we see that GF essentially controls the Witt ring W F and in fact, GF can be\nviewed as a Galois theoretic analogue of W F . In particular, GF detects orderings of\nfields. (Recall that P is an ordering of F if P is an additively closed subgroup of index\n2 in F \u2217 .) More precisely, we have:\nTheorem 8.2. [MS90] There is a 1-1 correspondence between the orderings of a field F\nand cosets {\u03c3\u03a6(GF ) | \u03c3 \u2208 GF \\\u03a6(GF )and \u03c3 2 = 1}. Here \u03a6(GF ) is the Frattini subgroup\nof GF , which is just the closed subgroup of GF generated by all squares in GF . The\ncorrespondence is as follows:\np\np\n\u03c3\u03a6(GF ) \u2212\u2192 P\u03c3 = {f \u2208 F \u2217 | \u03c3( f ) = f }.\nThis theorem was generalised considerably for detecting additive properties of multiplicative subgroups of F \u2217 in [MMS04]. In this paper (see [MMS04, Section 8]) it was\nshown that GF can be used also for detecting valuations on F .\nAlso in [AKM99, Corollary 3.9] it is shown that GF \u223c\n= GL if and only if k\u2217 (F ) \u223c\n= k\u2217 (L).\nHere k\u2217 (A) denotes the Milnor K-theory (mod 2) of a field A. In particular, in [AKM99,\nTheorem 3.14] it is shown that if R is the subring of H \u2217 (GF , F2 ) generated by one\ndimensional classes, then R is isomorphic to the Galois cohomology H \u2217 (GF , F2 ) of F .\nThus we see that GF also controls Galois cohomology and in fact H \u2217 (GF , F2 ) contains\n\n\f12\n\nSUNIL K. CHEBOLU AND J\u00c1N MIN\u00c1\u010c\n\n\u2217\n\nsome further substantial information about F which H \u2217 (GF , F2 ) does not contain. In\nsummary, GF is a very interesting object. On the one hand GF is much simpler than GF\nor Gq , yet it contains substantial information about the arithmetic of F . In [BLMS07,\nSection 2] the case of p > 2 was also considered, and the definition of GF was extended to\nfields which contain a primitive pth -root of unity. The key reason for restricting to p = 2\nin earlier papers stems from the interest in quadratic forms. Nevertheless a number of\ninteresting properties also hold for GF in the case p > 2.\n9. Towards the Auslander-Reiten translate \u03a92 F2\nBecause GF contains considerable information about the arithmetic of F , it is a\nnatural question to ask for properties of Gq , or more precisely Gq (F ), determined by\nGF . First of all, it is possible that for two fields F1 and F2 , we have\n\u223c GF but Gq (F1 ) \u2247 Gq (F2 ).\nGF =\n1\n\n2\n\nIndeed, set F1 = C((t1 ))((t2 )) to be a field of formal power series in t2 over the field\nof formal power series in t1 over C and F2 the field Q5 of 5-adic numbers. Then\nGF1 = GF2 = C4 \u00d7 C4 , but Gq (F1 ) = Z2 \u00d7 Z2 (Z2 is the additive group of 2-adic\nnumbers), while Gq (F2 ) = h\u03c3, \u03c4 | \u03c4 4 [\u03c4 \u22121 , \u03c3 \u22121 ] = 1i see [MS96, Koc02]. However, in this\n{3}\n{3}\ncase GF1 \u223c\n= GF2 , as they are both isomorphic to C4 \u00d7 C4 ; see [AGKM01].\n{3}\n\n[3]\n\nThe very interesting question about possible groups GF when GF is given, is currently investigated by Min\u00e1\u010d, Swallow and Topaz [MST]. In order to tackle this question\nit is important to understand the universal case when Gq (F ) is a free pro-2-group. From\nnow on we further assume that F \u2217 /F \u2217 2 is finite-dimensional. (This is the most impor{3}\ntant case to understand, as GF in general is the projective limit of its finite quotients.)\nLet n be the dimension. Then we have F \u2217 /F \u2217 2 = 2n . In this case we have an extension\n{3}\n\n\u2212\u2192 E \u2192 1\nQm\n\u223c\nwhere E = 1 C2 and A =\n= 1 C2 with m = (n \u2212 1)2n + 1. Set\nR = F (2) for simplicity. Indeed from Kummer theory we know that\n2\nA\u223c\n= HomF (R\u2217 /R\u2217 , F2 ).\nQn\n\n1 \u2212\u2192 A \u2212\u2192 GF\n\n{3}\nGal(GF /F (2) )\n\n2\n\n(2)\n\nThen also by Kummer theory the minimal number of topological generators of Gq :=\nGal(Fq /F (2) ) is equal to the dimension of R\u2217 /R\u2217 2 . From the topological version of\n(2)\n(2)\nSchreier's theorem we know that this number d(Gq ) is given by d(Gq ) = (n\u22121)2n +1,\n(2)\nbecause Gq is the open subgroup of index 2n of Gq and d(Gq ) = n. (See [Koc02,\nExample 6.3]) Thus\ndim F2 A =\n\ndim F2 R\u2217 /R\u2217 2\n\n=\n\ndim F2 H 1 (G(2)\nq , F2 )\n\n=\n\nd(G(2)\nq )\n\n=\n\n(n \u2212 1)2n + 1.\n\nMoreover, A is a natural F2 E-module where the E-action is induced by conjugation\n{3}\nin GF . The next result gives a completely arithmetical interpretation of the AuslanderReiten translate in our case. We write \u03a92E F2 in order to stress that we are working in\nthe category of F2 E-modules.\n\n\fAUSLANDER-REITEN SEQUENCES\n\n13\n\nTheorem 9.1. [Gas54]\n\u03a92E F2 \u223c\n= A.\nWe sketch in the next section a direct proof of this theorem as it also provides some\ninformation about the structure of our module A. After that we shall consider the AR\nsequence\n0 \u2212\u2192 \u03a92 F2 \u2212\u2192 M \u2212\u2192 F2 \u2212\u2192 0\n\nand interpret M and also its associated group AR(E) which will be defined later below\nas a certain Galois group.\n10. Generators and relations for \u03a92 F2\nQn\nQn\nRecall that E = 1 C2 = 1 h\u03c3i i. We shall first use the definition of \u03a92 F2 over F2 E\nto describe \u03a92 F2 via generators and relations and then we shall see that indeed A has\nthis presentation. This, in turn, will imply that A \u223c\n= \u03a92 F 2 .\nLet Pai be a free F2 E module of rank 1 generated by ai for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n, so Pai = F2 Eai .\nThen recall that \u03a92 F2 is defined by the short exact sequence:\n\u03c8\n\n\u01eb\n\n0 \u2212\u2192 \u03a92 F2 \u2212\u2192 \u2295ni=1 Pai (= P ) \u2212\u2192 F2 E \u2192 F2 \u2212\u2192 0,\nwhere \u01eb : F2 E \u2192 F2 is the augmentation map \u01eb(\u03c3i ) = 1 for all i, and \u03c8(ai ) = \u03c3i \u2212 1. We\nshall denote \u03c3i \u2212 1 by \u03c1i for simplicity. Exactness at F2 is trivial and exactness at F2 E\nis a standard exercise which we leave to the reader. Observe that \u03a92 F2 is determined\nonly up to a projective summand. But since we insist that \u03a92 F2 is projective-free, we\nactually get it up to an isomorphism of F2 E-modules.\nNote that \u03a92 F2 = Ker \u03c8, and it certainly contains the F2 E-submodule of P generated\nby\nS = {\u03c1i ai , \u03c1j ai + \u03c1i aj , 1 \u2264 i < j \u2264 n.}\nWe claim that the F2 E submodule W generated by S is the entire module \u03a92 F2 . First\nQ\nobserve that I = \u03a91 F2 = Ker \u01eb has dimension 2n \u2212 1 and \u03c1T = i\u2208T \u03c1i , where T is\na non-empty subset of {1, 2, * * * , n} form a basis of I. This allows us to pick a nice\nF2 -vector space section of \u03c8: V the vector space span of the set\nU = {\u03c1T ai 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n, and T \u2286 {i + 1, i + 2, * * * , n}}.\nIt is not hard to see that P splits as Ker \u03c8 \u2295 V as F2 -vector spaces. Therefore it is\nenough to show that W \u2286 ker \u03c8 together with V generate the entire module P over\nF2 . Set Q := W \u2295 V , the vector span of V and W over F2 . Since {a1 , a2 , * * * , an } \u2286 Q\nand {a1 , a2 , * * * , an } generates P as an F2 E-module, it is sufficient to show that Q is an\nF2 E submodule of P . Because W is an F2 E-submodule of Q it is enough to show that\nfor each v \u2208 U and \u03c1l we also have \u03b1 := \u03c1l v in Q. Write v = \u03c1T ai for some T and i. If\nl = i, then \u03b1 belongs to W . If l > i, then \u03b1 belongs to U \u222a {0}. In particular, in both\ncases, \u03b1 \u2208 Q. If l < i, then\n\u03b1\n\n= \u03c1T \u03c1l a i\n= \u03c1T (\u03c1l ai + \u03c1i al ) + \u03c1T \u03c1i al\n= w+v\n\n\f14\n\nSUNIL K. CHEBOLU AND J\u00c1N MIN\u00c1\u010c\n\n\u2217\n\nwhere the first summand belongs to W and the second summand belongs to U \u222a{0} \u2286 V .\nHence \u03b1 belongs to Q, as desired. This shows that \u03a92 F2 is generated over F2 E by the\nset S.\nLet us denote:\n[ai , aj , at1 , * * * , atr ] := \u03c1tr \u03c1tr\u22121 * * * \u03c1t1 (\u03c1i aj + \u03c1j ai ), and\n[ai 2 , at1 , * * * , atr ] := \u03c1tr \u03c1tr\u22121 * * * \u03c1t1 \u03c1i ai ,\n\nwhere all the subscripts range over the set {1, 2, * * * , n}. Then we have the following\nidentities. Below \u03c3 denotes an arbitrary permutation of the set {1, 2, 3, * * * , s}, and\nbi = ati for any i.\n(1)\n(2)\n(3)\n(4)\n(5)\n(6)\n\n[ai , aj ] = [aj , ai ]\n[ai , aj , b1 , * * * , bs ] = [ai , aj , b\u03c3(1) , * * * , b\u03c3(s) ]\n[a2i , b1 , * * * , bs ] = [a2i , b\u03c3(1) , * * * , b\u03c3(s) ]\n[ai , aj , ar ] + [aj , ar , ai ] + [ar , ai , aj ] = 0\n[a2i , ar ] = [ai , ar , ai ]\n[ai , aj , b1 , * * * , b\u03b1 , * * * , b\u03b1 , * * * , bs ] = 0\n\nThen \u03a92 F2 \u2286 P is a vector span over F2 of [ai , aj , at1 , . . . atr ] and [a2i , at1 , * * * atr ] as\nabove. In fact from the short exact sequence\n\u03c8\n\n\u01eb\n\n0 \u2212\u2192 \u03a92 F2 \u2212\u2192 P \u2212\u2192 F2 E \u2192 F2 \u2212\u2192 0,\n\nwe see that dimF2 \u03a92 F2 = n2n \u2212 2n + 1 = 2n (n \u2212 1) + 1. With what follows using the\nabove identities we see that the set\nX := {[cij , at1 , * * * , atr ] | 1 \u2264 i \u2264 j \u2264 n, i < t1 < * * * < tr \u2264 n}\n\ngenerates \u03a92 F2 over F2 . Here cij = [ai , aj ] if i < j or a2i if i = j. Observe that\n|X| =\n\nn\nX\ni=1\n\n(n \u2212 i + 1)2n\u2212i .\n\nIndeed for a fixed i there are n \u2212 i + 1 possibilities for j and there are 2n\u2212i possibilities\nfor the number of subsets of {i + 1, * * * , n} for the choices of t1 , * * * , tr . Also we have\nn\nX\ni=1\n\n(n \u2212 i + 1)Y n\u2212i =\n\nn\nX\ni=1\n\n(Y n\u2212i+1 )\u2032 =\n\n(n + 1)Y n (Y \u2212 1) \u2212 (Y n+1 \u2212 1)\n.\n(Y \u2212 1)2\n\nPn\nPlugging Y = 2, we see that |X| = i=1 (n \u2212 i + 1)2n\u2212i = 2n (n \u2212 1) + 1. Hence X is\nthe basis of \u03a92 F2 over F2 . On the other hand, a detailed investigation of identities in\n[3]\nGF (see [GT67, MST]) shows that a basis of A over F2 is\nZ = {[dij , \u03c3t1 , * * * \u03c3tr ] | 1 \u2264 i \u2264 j \u2264 n, i < t1 < * * * < tr \u2264 n},\n\ndij = [\u03c3i , \u03c3j ] if i < j, dii = \u03c3i2 , and [\u03c31 , \u03c32 , * * * , \u03c3l ] = [* * * [[[\u03c31 , \u03c32 ], \u03c33 ], * * * , \u03c3l ]. In fact,\n[3]\nwriting \u03c3i in place of ai above, the same set of 6 identities hold in GF . This shows\nthat the map \u03c6 : \u03a92 F2 \u2212\u2192 A defined by \u03c6(a2i ) = \u03c3i2 , and \u03c6([ai , aj ]) = [\u03c3i , \u03c3j ] is a welldefined surjective F2 E homomorphism and because of dimensional reasons it has to be\nan isomorphism.\n\n\fAUSLANDER-REITEN SEQUENCES\n\n15\n\n11. The Auslander-Reiten sequence ending in F2\nFinally we want to obtain the Auslander-Reiten sequence ending in F2 :\n\u03b7\n\n0 \u2212\u2192 \u03a92 F2 \u2212\u2192 M \u2212\u2192 F2 \u2212\u2192 0.\nWe will get a sequence of this form which is not split. Then simply because\nExt1F2 E (F2 , \u03a92 F2 ) = F2\nthe non-split sequence we obtain has to be an Auslander-Reiten sequence; see [CR87,\nProposition (78.28)].\nObserve from our proof of our description of \u03a92 F2 \u2286 P , that a := \u03c1n \u03c1n\u22121 * * * \u03c12 a1\nbelongs to P \u2212 \u03a92 F2 . Let M := \u03a92 F2 + {a, 0} \u2286 P . (Because \u03c1i a belongs to \u03a92 F2 for\neach i = 1, 2, * * * , n, we see that M is indeed an F2 E-module.) Now, let \u03b7 : M \u2192 F2\nbe defined by \u03b7(\u03a92 F2 ) = 0 and \u03b7(a) = 1. Observe that since \u03c11 a belongs to \u03a92 F2 and\n\u03c1i a = 0 for i \u2265 2, we obtain that \u03b7 is indeed an F2 E-homomorphism.\nWe claim that the short exact sequence\n\u03b7\n\n0 \u2212\u2192 \u03a92 F2 \u2212\u2192 M \u2212\u2192 F2 \u2212\u2192 0\nis an Auslander-Reiten sequence. Suppose to the contrary, this sequence splits. Then\nthe coset a + \u03a92 F2 would contain a trivial element t = a + m, m \u2208 \u03a92 F2 (i.e., the action\nof each \u03c1i on t is 0). But t \u2208 Soc(P ) \u2286 \u03a92 F2 . Hence t \u2212 m = a belongs to \u03a92 F2 , which is\na contradiction. (Here Soc(P ) is the socle of P which is the submodule of E consisting\nof the fixed elements of P under the action of E.) So we are done.\nQn\nQn\nWe now introduce Auslander-Reiten groups. Let E = i=1 C2 = i=1 h\u03c3i i as before.\nAssume that n \u2265 2. Consider the Auslander-Reiten sequence\nh\n\n0 \u2212\u2192 \u03a92 F2 \u2212\u2192 M \u2212\u2192 F2 \u2212\u2192 0.\nConsider the long exact sequence in cohomology associated to the above AR sequence.\nAs observed before, all connecting homomorphisms are zero except the first one. In\nparticular, we have a short exact sequence:\n0 \u2212\u2192 H 2 (E, \u03a92 F2 ) \u2212\u2192 H 2 (E, M ) \u2212\u2192 H 2 (E, F2 ) \u2212\u2192 0.\n\u223c F2 . The unique non-zero element of H 2 (E, \u03a92 F2 ) correFurthermore, H 2 (E, \u03a92 F2 ) =\nsponds to a short exact sequence\n{3}\n\n1 \u2212\u2192 \u03a92 F2 \u2212\u2192 GF\n\n\u22172\n\n\u2212\u2192 E \u2212\u2192 1\n\n{3}\n\nwhere |F \u2217 /F | = 2n and Gal(Fq /F ) is a free pro-2-group. Note that in our case GF\ndoes not depend on F , but only on the number n of the rank of the free absolute\npro-2-group GF . Therefore we shall denote it by G{3} (n). Now consider the following\ncommutative diagram\n1\n\n/ \u03a92 F 2\n\n1\n\n\u000f\n/M\n\n/ G{3} (n)\n\n/E\n\n\u000f\n/ T (n)\n\n\u000f\n/E\n\n/1\n\n=\n\nh\n\n/1\n\nHere T (n) is the pushout of G{3} (n) and M along \u03a92 F2 . The second row corresponds\nto the image of the non-trivial element of H 2 (E, \u03a92 F2 ) in H 2 (E, M ).\n\n\f16\n\nSUNIL K. CHEBOLU AND J\u00c1N MIN\u00c1\u010c\n\n\u2217\n\nDefinition 11.1. We call T (n) the Auslander-Reiten group associated to E.\nObserve that we have obtained a Galois theoretic model for our Auslander-Reiten\nsequence:\n0 \u2212\u2192 \u03a92 F2 \u2212\u2192 M \u2212\u2192 F2 \u2212\u2192 0.\n\nIndeed, let K/L be a Galois extension as above such that Gal(K/F ) = T (n). Then we\nhave a short exact sequence\n0 \u2212\u2192 M \u2212\u2192 T (n) \u2212\u2192 G \u2212\u2192 0\n\nwhere AR Galois group T (n) is generated by G{3} (n) and \u03c4 subject to the relations\n\u03c4 2 = 1, [\u03c4, \u03c3i ] = 1 for 2 \u2264 i \u2264 n, and [\u03c4, \u03c31 ] = [\u03c312 , \u03c32 , * * * , \u03c3n ]. Let L be the fixed field\nof M . Then the Galois group Gal(K/L) \u223c\n= M is the middle term of our Auslander-Reiten\nsequence. Further, let H be a subgroup generated by \u03c31 , * * * , \u03c3n . Then H \u223c\n= G{3} (n)\n2\n\u223c\nand H \u2229 M = \u03a9 F2 .

Conclusion\nWe hope that our hot and mild appetizers will inspire our readers in their choices\nof further delightful, tasty, and mouth-watering main dishes. John Labute's skillful\ninterplay between Lie theoretic and group theoretic methods in his past work (see for\nexample [Lab67]), as well as in his recent work ([Lab06]) provides us with inspiration for\nexploiting the connections between modular representation theory and Galois theory.\nWe are now lifting our glasses of champagne in honour of John Labute and we are\nwishing him happy further research, and pleasant further Auslander-Reiten encounters.\nReferences\n[AGKM01] Alejandro Adem, Wenfeng Gao, Dikran B.
