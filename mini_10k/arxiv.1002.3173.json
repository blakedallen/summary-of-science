In the standard lore, the machinery responsible for these\nprocesses is termed cosmic inflation and, in general terms, what it means is that microscopic quantum fluctuations pervading the primordial Universe are stretched to what\ncorrespond, today, to cosmological scales (see [1, 2, 3] for comprehensive introductions\nto inflation.) These primordial perturbations serve as initial conditions for the process\nof structure formation, which enhance these initial perturbations through gravitational\ninstability. The subsequent (classical) evolution of these instabilities preserves the main\nstatistical features of these fluctuations that were inherited from their inflationary origin\n\u2013 provided, of course, that we restrain ourselves to linear perturbation theory.\nHowever, given that matter has a natural tendency to cluster, and this inevitably\nleads to non-linearities (not to mention the sorts of complications that come with baryonic physics), the structures which are visible today are far from ideal probes of those\nstatistical properties. CMB photons, on the other hand, to an excellent approximation\nexperience free streaming since the time of decoupling (z \u2248 1100), and are therefore\nexempt from these non-linearities (except, of course, for secondary anisotropies such\nas the Rees-Sciama effect or the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect), which implies that they\nconstitute an ideal window to the physics of the early Universe \u2013 see, e.g., [4, 5, 6]. In\nfact, we can determine the primary CMB anisotropies as well as most of the secondary\nanisotropies on large scales, such as the Integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect, completely in\nterms of the initial conditions by means of a linear kernel:\n\u02c6\n\u02c6 \u03b70\nX\n\u2206T (n\u0302; \u03b70 )\n3 0\n= dx\nd\u03b7 0\nKi (~x 0 , \u03b7 0 ; n\u0302)S i (~x 0 , \u03b7 0 ) ,\n(1)\n\u0398(n\u0302) \u2261\nT (\u03b70 )\n0\ni\nwhere \u03b7 0 is conformal time, and S i denote the initial conditions of all matter and metric\nfields (as well as their time derivatives, if the initial conditions are non-adiabatic.) Here\nKi is a linear kernel, or a retarded Green's function, that propagates the radiation field\nto the time and place of its detection, here on Earth. Since that kernel is insensitive\nto the statistical nature of the initial conditions (which can be thought of as constants\nwhich multiply the source terms), those properties are precisely transferred to the CMB\ntemperature field \u0398.\nThe statistical properties of the primordial fluctuations are, to lowest order in perturbation theory, quite simple: because the quantum fluctuations that get stretched\nand enhanced by inflation are basically harmonic oscillators in their ground state, the\ndistribution of those fluctuations is Gaussian, with each mode an independent random\nvariable. The Fourier modes of these fluctuations are characterized by random phases\n(corresponding to the random initial values of the oscillators), with zero mean, and variances which are given simply by the field mass and the mode's wavenumber k = 2\u03c0/\u03bb.\n3\n\n\fThe presence of higher-order interactions (which exist even for free fields, because of\ngravity) changes this simple picture, introducing higher-order correlations which destroy gaussianity \u2013 even in the simplest scenario of inflation [7, 8, 9]. However, since\nthese interactions are typically suppressed by powers of the factor GH 2 ' 10\u221212 , where\nG is Newton's constant and H the Hubble parameter during inflation, the corrections\nare small \u2013 but, at least in principle, detectable [10, 11, 12].\nSince these statistical properties are a generic prediction of (essentially) all inflationary models, they can also be inferred from two ingredients that are usually assumed\nas a first approximation to our Universe. First, since inflation was designed to stretch\nour Universe until it became spatially homogeneous and isotropic, it is reasonable to\nexpect that all statistical momenta of the CMB should be spatially homogeneous and\nrotationally invariant, regardless of their general form. Second, in linear perturbation\ntheory [13] where we have a large number of cosmological fluctuations evolving independently, we can expect, based on the central limit theorem, that the Universe will\nobey a Gaussian distribution.\nThe power of this program lies, therefore, in its simplicity: if the Universe is indeed\nGaussian, homogeneous and statistically isotropic (SI), then essentially all the information about inflation and the linear (low redshift) evolution of the Universe is encoded\nin the variance, or two-point correlation function, of large-scale cosmological structures\nand/or the CMB. As it turns out, the five year dataset from the Wilkinson Microwave\nanisotropy probe (WMAP) strongly supports these predictions [14, 11]. Moreover, the\nmeasurements of the CMB temperature power spectrum by the WMAP team, alongside\nmeasurements of the matter power spectrum from existing survey of galaxies [15, 16]\nand data from type Ia supernovae [17, 18, 19], have shown remarkable consistency with\na concordance model (\u039bCDM), in which the cosmos figures as a Gaussian, spatially\nflat, approximately homogeneous and statistically isotropic web of structures composed\nmainly of baryons, dark matter and dark energy.\nHowever, while the detection of a nearly scale-invariant and Gaussian spectrum is a\npowerful boost to the idea of inflation, just knowing the variance of the primordial fluctuations is not sufficient to single out which particular inflationary model was realized\nin our Universe. For that we will need not only the 2-point function, but the higher\nmomenta of the distribution as well. Therefore, in order to break this model degeneracy\nwe must go beyond the framework of the \u039bCDM, Gaussian, spatially homogeneous and\nstatistically isotropic Universe.\nReconstructing our cosmic history, however, is not the only reason to explore further\nthe statistical properties of the CMB. The full-sky temperature maps by WMAP [20, 11]\nhave revealed the existence of a series of large-angle anomalies \u2013 which, incidentally\nwere (on hindsight) already visible in the lower-resolution COBE data [21]. These\nanomalies suggest that at least one of our cherished hypothesis underlying the standard\ncosmological model might be wrong \u2013 even as a first-order approximation. Perhaps\nthe most intriguing anomalies (described in more detail in other review papers in this\nvolume) are the low value of the quadrupole and its alignment of the quadrupole (` = 2)\n4\n\n\fwith the octupole (` = 3) [22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27], the sphericity [26] (or lack of planarity\n[28]), of the multipole ` = 5, and the north-south asymmetry [29, 30, 31, 32, 33]. In\nthe framework of the standard cosmological model, these are very unlikely statistical\nevents, and yet the evidence that they exist in the real data (and are not artifacts of\npoorly subtracted extended foregrounds \u2013 e.g., [34]) is strong.\nConcerning theoretical explanations, even though we have by now an arsenal of adhoc models designed to account for the existence of these anomalies, none has yet quite\nsucceeded in explaining their origin. Nevertheless, they all share the point of view that\nthe detected anomalies might be related to a deviation of gaussianity and/or statistical\nisotropy.\nIn this review we will describe, first, how to characterize, from the point of view of\nthe underlying spacetime symmetries, both non-gaussianity and statistical anisotropy.\nWe will adopt two guiding principles. The first is that gaussianity and SI, being completely different properties of a random variable, should be treated separately, whenever\npossible or practical. Second, since there is only one type of gaussianity and SI but virtually infinite ways away from them, it is important to try to measure these deviations\nwithout a particular model or anomaly in mind \u2013 although we may eventually appeal\nto particular models as illustrations or as a means of comparison. This approach is not\nnew and, although not usually mentioned explicitly, it has been adopted in a number\nof recent papers [35, 36].\nOne of the main motivations for this model-independent approach is the difficult issue of aprioristic statistics: one can only test the random nature of a process if it can be\nrepeated a very large (formally, infinite) number of times. Since the CMB only changes\non a timescale of tens of millions of years, waiting for our surface of last scattering\nto probe a different region of the Universe is not a practical proposition. Instead, we\nare stuck with one dataset (a sequence of apparently random numbers), which we can\nsubject to any number of tests. Clearly, by sheer chance about 30% of the tests will give\na positive detection with 70% confidence level (C.L.), 10% will give a positive detection\nwith 90% C.L., and so on. With enough time, anyone can come up with detections of\narbitrarily high significance \u2013 and ingenuity will surely accelerate this process. Hence,\nit would be useful to have a few guiding principles to inform and motivate our statistical\ntests, so that we don't end up shooting blindly at a finite number of fish in a small\nwheelbarrow.\nThis review is divided in two parts. We start Part I by reviewing the basic statistical\nframework behind linear perturbation theory (\u00a72). This serves as a motivation for \u00a73,\nwhere we discuss the formal aspects of non-Gaussian and statistically isotropic models\n(\u00a73.1), as well as Gaussian models of statistical anisotropy (\u00a73.2). Part II is devoted to\na discussion on model-independent cosmological tests of non-gaussianity and statistical\nanisotropy and their application to CMB data. We focus on two particular tests,\nnamely, the multipole vectors statistics (\u00a74) and functional modifications of the twopoint correlation function (\u00a75). After discussing how such tests are usually carried out\nwhen searching for anomalies in CMB data (\u00a76.1), we present a new formalism which\n5\n\n\fgeneralizes the standard procedure by including the ergodicity of cosmological data as\na possible source of errors (\u00a76.2). This formalism is illustrated in \u00a77, where we carry a\nsearch of planar-type deviations of isotropy in CMB data. We then conclude in \u00a78.\n\n6\n\n\fPart I\n\nThe linearized Universe\n2\n\nGeneral structure\n\nWe start by defining the temperature fluctuation field. Since the background radiation\nis known to have an average temperature of 2.725K, we are interested only in deviations from this value at a given direction n\u0302 in the CMB sky. So let us consider the\ndimensionless function on S 2 :\n\u0398(n\u0302) \u2261\n\nT (n\u0302) \u2212 T0\n,\nT0\n\n(2)\n\nwhere T0 = 2.725 K is the blackbody temperature of the mean photon energy distribution \u2013 which, if homogeneity holds, is also equal to the ensemble average of the\ntemperature.\nIn full generality, the fluctuation field is not only a function of the position vector\n~n, but also of the time in which our measurements are taken. In practice, the time and\ndisplacement of measurements vary so slowly that we can ignore these dependences\naltogether. Therefore, we can equally well consider this function as one defined only on\nthe unit radius sphere S 2 , for which the following decomposition holds:\nX\na`m Y`m (n\u0302) .\n(3)\n\u0398(n\u0302) =\n`,m\n\u2217\nSince the spherical harmonics Y`m (n\u0302) obey the symmetry Y`m\n(n\u0302) = (\u22121)m Y`,\u2212m (n\u0302), the\nfact that the temperature field is a real function implies the identity a\u2217`m = (\u22121)m a`,\u2212m .\nThis means that each temperature multipole ` is completely characterized by 2` + 1\nreal degrees of freedom.\n\n2.1\n\nFrom inhomogeneities to anisotropies: linear theory\n\nThe ultimate source of anisotropies in the Universe are the inhomogeneities in the\nbaryon-photon fluid, as well as their associated spacetime metric fluctuations. If the\nphotons were in perfect equilibrium with the baryons up to a sharply defined moment\nin time (the so-called instant recombination approximation), their distribution would\nhave only one parameter (the equilibrium temperature at each point), so that photons\nflying off in any direction would have exactly the same energies. In that case, the\nphotons we see today coming from a line-of-sight n\u0302 would reflect simply the density\nand gravitational potentials (the \"sources\") at the position R n\u0302, where R is the radius\nto that (instantaneous) last scattering surface. Evidently, multiple scatterings at the\nepoch of recombination, combined with the fact that anisotropies themselves act as\nsources for more anisotropies, complicate this picture, and in general the relationship\n7\n\n\fof the sources with the anisotropies must be calculated from either a set of EinsteinBoltzmann equations or, equivalently, from the line-of-sight integral equations coupled\nwith the Einstein, continuity and Euler equations [6].\nAssuming for simplicity that recombination was instantaneous, at a time \u03b7R , the\nlinear kernels of Eq. (1) reduce to Ki (~x 0 , \u03b7 0 ; n\u0302) \u2192 \u03b2i \u03b4(\u03b7 0 \u2212 \u03b7R )\u03b4(~x 0 \u2212 n\u0302R), where\nR = \u03b70 \u2212 \u03b7R and \u03b2i are constant coefficients. The photon distribution that we measure\non Earth would therefore be given by:\nX\n\u0398(n\u0302) \u2248\n\u03b2i S i (~x 0 = n\u0302R, \u03b7 0 = \u03b7R ) .\n(4)\ni\n\nWe can also express this result in terms of the Fourier spectrum of the sources:\nX \u02c6 d3 k ~\neik*n\u0302R S i (~k, \u03b7R ) .\n\u0398(n\u0302) \u2248\n\u03b2i\n3\n(2\u03c0)\ni\n\n(5)\n\nNow we can use what is usually referred to as \"Rayleigh's expansion\" (though Watson,\nin his classic book on Bessel functions, attributes this to Bauer, J. f. Math. LVI, 1859):\nX\n~\n\u2217\neik*~x = 4\u03c0\ni` j` (kx) Y`m\n(k\u0302) Y`m (x\u0302) ,\n(6)\n`m\n\nwhere j` (z) are the spherical Bessel functions. Substituting Eq. (6) into Eq. (5) we\nobtain that:\n\u02c6\n\u02c6\nd3 k\n\u2217\n2\n\u2217\n\u0398(~k) \u00d7 4\u03c0 i` j` (kR) Y`m\n(k\u0302) ,\n(7)\na`m = d n\u0302 Y`m (n\u0302) \u0398(n\u0302) \u2248\n(2\u03c0)3\nP\nwhere we have loosely collected the sources into the term \u0398(~k) \u2261 i \u03b2i S i (~k, \u03b7R ). This\nexpression conveys well the simple relation between the Fourier modes and the spherical\nharmonic modes. Therefore, up to coefficients which are known given some background\ncosmology, the statistical properties of the harmonic coefficients a`m are inherited from\nthose of the Fourier modes \u0398(~k) of the underlying matter and metric fields. Notice\nthat the properties of the a`m 's under rotations, on the other hand, have nothing to do\nwith the statistical properties of the fluctuations: they come directly from the spherical\nharmonic functions Y`m .\n\n2.2\n\nStatistics in Fourier space\n\nThe characterization of the statistics of random variables is most commonly expressed\nin terms of the correlation functions. The two-point correlation function is the ensemble\nexpectation value:\nC(~k, ~k 0 ) \u2261 h\u0398(~k)\u0398(~k 0 )i .\n(8)\nIn the absence of any symmetries, this would be a generic function of the arguments ~k\nand ~k 0 , with only two constraints: first, because \u0398(~x) is a real function, \u0398\u2217 (~k) = \u0398(\u2212~k),\n8\n\n\fhence in our definition C \u2217 (~k, ~k 0 ) = C(\u2212~k, \u2212~k 0 ); and second, due to the associative\nnature of the expectation value, C(~k, ~k 0 ) = C(~k 0 , ~k). It is obvious how to generalize this\ndefinition to 3, 4 or an arbitrary number of fields at different ~k's (or \"points\".)\nLet us first discuss the issue of gaussianity. If we say that the variables \u0398(~k) are\nGaussian random numbers, then all the information that characterizes their distribution\nis contained in their two-point function C(~k, ~k 0 ). The probability distribution function\n(pdf) is then formally given by:\n\"\n#\n~k)\u0398(~k 0 )\n\u0398(\nP [\u0398(~k), \u0398(~k 0 )] \u223c exp \u2212\n.\n2 C(~k, ~k 0 )\nIn this case, all higher-order correlation functions are either zero (for odd numbers of\npoints) or they are simply connected to the two-point function by means of Wick's\nTheorem:\nN\nXY\n\u03b1\n~\n~\n~\nBi,j\nh\u0398(~ki )\u0398(~kj )i ,\n(9)\nh\u0398(k1 )\u0398(k2 ) . . . \u0398(k2N )iG =\ni,j \u03b1=1\n\nwhere the sum runs over all permutations of the pairs of wave vectors and Bi,j are\nweights.\nSecond, let's consider the issue of homogeneity. A field is homogeneous if its expectation values (or averages) do not dependent on the spatial points where they are\nevaluated. In terms of the N -point functions in real space, we should have that:\nHomog.\n\nh\u0398(~x1 )\u0398(~x2 ) . . . \u0398(~xN )i \u2192 CN (~x1 \u2212 ~x2 , ..., ~xN \u22121 \u2212 ~xN ) .\n\n(10)\n\nWriting this expression in terms of the Fourier modes, we get that:\n\u02c6 3\nd k1 d3 k1 . . . d3 kN \u2212i~k1 *~x1 \u2212i~k2 *~x2\n~\nh\u0398(~x1 )\u0398(~x2 ) . . . \u0398(~xN )i =\ne\ne\n. . . e\u2212ikN *~xN\n3N\n(2\u03c0)\n\u00d7 h\u0398(~k1 )\u0398(~k2 ) . . . \u0398(~kN )i .\n(11)\nHomogeneity demands that the expression in Eq. (11) is a function of the distances\nbetween spatial points only, not of the points themselves. Hence, the expectation\nvalue in Fourier space on the right-hand-side of this expression must be proportional\nto \u03b4(~k1 + ~k2 + . . . + ~kN ). In other words, the hypothesis of homogeneity constrains the\nN -point function in Fourier space to be of the form:\nh\u0398(~k1 )\u0398(~k2 ) . . . \u0398(~kN )iH = (2\u03c0)3 \u00d1 (~k1 , ~k2 , . . . , ~kN ) \u03b4(~k1 + ~k2 + . . . + ~kN ) .\n\n(12)\n\nNotice that the \"(N \u2212 1)-spectrum\" in Fourier space, \u00d1 , can still be a function of the\ndirections of the wavenumbers ~ki (it will be, in fact, a function of N \u2212 1 such vectors,\ndue to the global momentum conservation expressed by the \u03b4-function.) Models which\nrealize the general idea of Eq. (12) correspond to homogeneous but anisotropic universes\n[37, 38, 39, 40].\n9\n\n\fThere is a useful diagrammatic illustration for the N -point functions in Fourier\nspace that enforce homogeneity. Notice that we could use the \u03b4-function in Eq. (12)\nto integrate out any one of the momenta ~ki in Eq. (11). Let us instead rewrite the\n\u03b4-functions in terms of triangles, so for the 4-point function we have:\n\u02c6\n~\n~\n~\n~\n\u03b4(k1 + k2 + k3 + k4 ) =\nd3 q \u03b4(~k1 + ~k2 \u2212 ~q) \u03b4(~k3 + ~k4 + ~q) ,\n(13)\nwhereas for the 5-point function we have:\n\u02c6\n~\n~\n~\n~\n~\n\u03b4(k1 + k2 + k3 + k4 + k5 ) =\nd3 q d3 q 0 \u03b4(~k1 + ~k2 \u2212 ~q) \u03b4(~q + ~k3 \u2212 ~q 0 ) \u03b4(~q 0 + ~k4 + ~k5 ) , (14)\nand so on, so that the N -point \u03b4-function is reduced to N \u2212 2 triangles with N \u2212 3\n\"internal momenta\" (the idea is nicely illustrated in Fig. 1.) Substituting the expression\nfor the N -point \u03b4-function into Eq. (11) and integrating out all external momenta but\nthe first (~k1 ) and last (~kN ), the result is that:\n\u02c6\n1\nd3 k1 d3 q1 . . . d3 qN \u22123 d3 kN\nh\u0398(~x1 )\u0398(~x2 ) . . . \u0398(~xN )i =\n(2\u03c0)3N\n~\n\n~\n\n\u00d7 eik1 *(~x1 \u2212~x2 ) ei~q1 *(~x2 \u2212~x3 ) . . . ei~qN \u22123 *(~xN \u22122 \u2212~xN \u22121 ) eikN *(~xN \u22121 \u2212~xN )\n\u00d7 h\u0398(~k1 )\u0398(~q1 \u2212 ~k1 ) . . . \u0398(~kN )i .\n(15)\nThis expressions shows explicitly that the real-space N -point function above does not\ndepend on any particular spatial point, only on the intervals between points.\n\nk\n\n1\n\nk\n\nk\n\nk\n\n1\n\nk\n2\n\nk\n\n3\n\nq\n\n2\n\nk\n\nk\n\n1\n\nk\n\n3\n\n2\n\nk\n1\n\nq \u0301\n\nq\nk\n\nk\n4\n\n2\n\nk\n\n3\n\nk\n\n4\n\n5\n\nFigure 1: Diagrammatic representation of the 2, 3, 4 and 5-point correlation functions\nin Fourier space. The dashed lines represent internal momenta.\n\nFinally, what are the constraints imposed on the N -point functions that come from\nisotropy alone? Clearly, no dependence on the directions defined by the points, ~xi \u2212 ~xj ,\ncan arise in the final expression for the N -point functions in real space, so from Eq. (11)\nwe see that the N -point function in Fourier space should depend only on the moduli of\nthe wavenumbers \u2013 up to some momentum-conservation \u03b4-functions, which naturally\ncarry vector degrees of freedom.\nIn this review we will mostly be concerned with tests of isotropy given homogeneity\n(but not necessarily Gaussianity), so in our case we will usually assume that the N -point\nfunction in Fourier space assumes the form given in Eq. (12).\n10\n\n\f2.3\n\nStatistics in harmonic space\n\nIn the previous section we characterized the statistics of our field in Fourier space, which\nin most cases is most easily related to fundamental models such as inflation. Now we\nwill change to harmonic representation, because that's what is most directly related to\nthe observations of the CMB, \u0398(n\u0302), which are taken over the unit sphere S 2 . We will\ndiscuss mostly the two-point function here, and we defer a fuller discussion of N -point\nfunctions in harmonic space to Section 3.\nFrom Eq. (7) we can start by taking the two-point function in harmonic space, and\ncomputing it in terms of the two-point function in Fourier space:\n\u02c6 3 3 0\nd kd k\n0\n\u2217\n(4\u03c0)2 i` (\u2212i)` j` (kR) j`0 (k 0 R) Y`m (k\u0302)Y`\u22170 m0 (k\u0302 0 ) h\u0398(~k)\u0398\u2217 (~k 0 )i .\nha`m a`0 m0 i =\n6\n(2\u03c0)\n(16)\nUnder the hypothesis of homogeneity, this expression simplifies considerably, leading\nto:\n\u02c6\n2\n0\n\u2217\nha`m a`0 m0 iH =\nd3 k i` (\u2212i)` j` (kR) j`0 (kR) Y`m (k\u0302)Y`\u22170 m0 (k\u0302) \u00d7 \u00d12 (~k) .\n(17)\n\u03c0\nIf, in addition to homogeneity, we also assume isotropy, then \u00d12 \u2192 P (k), and the\nintegration over angles factors out, leading to the orthogonality condition for spherical\nharmonics:\n\u02c6\nd2 k\u0302 Y`m (k\u0302) Y`\u22170 m0 (k\u0302) = \u03b4``0 \u03b4mm0 ,\nand as a result the covariance of the a`m 's becomes diagonal:\n\u02c6\n2\ndk 2\n\u2217\nj` (kR) k 3 P (k)\nha`m a`0 m0 iH,I = \u03b4``0 \u03b4mm0\nk\n\u03c0\n\u02c6\n= 4\u03c0 \u03b4``0 \u03b4mm0\nd log k j`2 (kR) \u22062T (k)\n\n(18)\n\n\u2261 C` \u03b4``0 \u03b4mm0 ,\nwhere we have defined the usual temperature power spectrum \u2206T (k) = k 3 P (k)/2\u03c0 2 in\nthe middle line, and the angular power spectrum C` in the last line of Eq. (18). As\na pedagogical note, let's recall that the power spectrum basically expresses how much\npower the two-point correlation function has per unit log k:\n\u02c6\nsin(k|~x \u2212 ~x0 |) 2\n0\n\u2206T (k) .\n(19)\nh\u0398(~x)\u0398(~x )iH,I = d log k\nk|~x \u2212 ~x0 |\nIn an analogous manner to what was done above, we can also construct the angular\ntwo-point correlation function in harmonic space:\nXX\n\u2217\n(n\u03020 ) .\n(20)\nh\u0398(n\u0302)\u0398(n\u03020 )i =\nha`m a\u2217`0 m0 iY`m (n\u0302)Y`m\n`m `0 m0\n\n11\n\n\fThe hypothesis of homogeneity by itself does not lead to significant simplifications, but\nisotropy leads to a very intuitive expression for the angular two-point function:\nXX\n\u2217\n(n\u03020 )\n(21)\nh\u0398(n\u0302)\u0398(n\u03020 )iH,I =\nC` \u03b4``0 \u03b4mm0 Y`m (n\u0302)Y`m\n`m `0 m0\n\n=\n\nX\n`\n\nC`\n\n2` + 1\nP` (n\u0302 * n\u03020 ) .\n4\u03c0\n\nClearly, not only is this expression the analogous in S 2 of Eq. (19), but in fact the\nFourier power spectrum \u22062T (k) and the angular power spectrum C` are defined in terms\nof each other as indicated in Eq. (21):\n\u02c6\nC` = 4\u03c0 d log k j`2 (kR) \u22062T (k) .\n(22)\nNow, using the facts that the spherical Bessel \u0301 function of order ` peaks when its argument is approximately given by `, and that d log z j`2 (z) = 1/(2`(` + 1)), we obtain\nthat1 :\n2\u03c0\n\u22062 (k = `/R) .\n(23)\nC` \u2248\n`(` + 1) T\nIncidentally, from this expression it is clear why it is customary to define:\nC` \u2261\n\n`(` + 1)\nC` \u2248 \u22062T (k = `/R) .\n2\u03c0\n\nUsing Eq. (11) we can easily generalize the results of this subsection to N -point\nfunctions in S 2 and in harmonic space, however, the assumption of isotropy alone does\nvery little to simplify our life. The hypothesis of homogeneity, on the other hand,\ngreatly simplifies the angular N -point functions, and most of the work in statistical\nanisotropy of the CMB that goes beyond the two-point function assumes that homogeneity holds. Notice that the issue of gaussianity is, as always, confined to the question\nof whether or not the two-point function holds all information about the distribution\nof the relevant variables, and is therefore completely separated from questions about\nhomogeneity and/or isotropy.\nAlso notice that the separable nature of the definition (20) implies here as well, like\nin Fourier space, a reciprocity relation for the correlation function:\nC(n\u03021 , n\u03022 ) = C(n\u03022 , n\u03021 ) .\n\n(24)\n\nThis symmetry must hold regardless of underlying models, and is important in order\nto analyze the symmetries of the correlation function, as we shall see later.\nBefore we move on, it is perhaps important to mention that the decomposition (20)\nis not unique. In fact, instead of the angular momenta of the parts, (`1 , m1 ; `2 , m2 ), we\n1\n\nThis is one type of what has become known in the astrophysics literature as Limber's approximations.\n\n12\n\n\fcould equally well have used the basis of total angular momentum (L, M ; `1 , `2 ) and\ndecomposed that expression as:\nXX\nLM\nC(n\u03021 , n\u03022 ) =\nALM\n(25)\n`1 `2 Y`1 `2 (n\u03021 , n\u03022 )\nL,M `1 ,`2\n\nwhere Y`LM\nare known as the bipolar spherical harmonics, defined by [41]:\n1 `2\nY`LM\n(n\u03021 , n\u03022 ) = [Y`1 (n\u03021 ) \u2297 Y`2 (n\u03022 )]LM ,\n1 `2\nwhere L and M = m1 + m2 are the eigenvalues of the total and azimuthal angular\nmomentum operators, respectively. This decomposition is completely equivalent to Eq.\n(20), and we can exchange from one decomposition to another by using the relation:\n\u0012\n\u0013\nX\n\u221a\n`1 `2\nL\nLM\nM +`1 \u2212`2\n2L + 1\n,\n(26)\nA`1 `2 =\nha`1 m1 a`2 m2 i(\u22121)\nm1 m2 \u2212M\nm1 m2\n\nwhere the 3 \u00d7 2 matrices above are the well-known 3-j coefficients. At this point, it\nis only a matter of mathematical convenience whether we choose to decompose the\ncorrelation function as in (20) or as in (25). Although the bipolar harmonics behave\nsimilarly to the usual spherical harmonics in many aspects, the modulations of the\ncorrelation function as described in this basis have a peculiar interpretation. We will\nnot go further into detail about this decomposition here, as it is discussed at length in\nanother review article in this volume.\n\n2.4\n\nEstimators and cosmic variance\n\nReturning to the covariance matrix (18), we see that, if we assume gaussianity of the\na`m 's, then the angular power spectrum suffices to describe statistically how much the\ntemperature fluctuates in any given angular scale; all we have to do is to calculate\nthe average (18). This can be a problem, though, since we have only one Universe to\nmeasure, and therefore only one set of a`m 's. In other words, the average in (18) is\npoorly determined.\nAt this point, the hypothesis that our Universe is spatially homogeneous and isotropic\nat cosmological scales comes not only as simplifying assumption about the spacetime\nsymmetries, but also as a remedy to this unavoidable smallness of the working cosmologist's sample space. If isotropy holds, different cosmological scales are statistically\nindependent, which means that we can take advantage of the ergodic hypothesis and\ntrade averaging over an ensemble for averaging over space. In other words, for a given\n` we can consider each of the 2` + 1 real numbers in a`m as statistically independent\nGaussian random variables, and define a statistical estimator for their variances as the\naverage:\n`\nX\n1\nb\n|a`m |2 .\n(27)\nC` \u2261\n2` + 1 m=\u2212`\n13\n\n\fThe smaller the angular scales (` bigger), the larger the number of independent patches\nthat the CMB sky can be divided into. Therefore, in this limit we should have:\nb` = C` .\nlim C\n\n`\u2192\u221e\n\nOn the other hand, for large angular scales (small `'s), the number of independent\npatches of our Universe becomes smaller, and (27) becomes a weak estimation of the\nC` 's. This means that any statistical analysis of the Universe on large scales will be\nplagued by this intrinsic cosmic sample variance. Notice that this is an unavoidable\nlimit as long as we have only one observable Universe.\nFinally, it is important to keep in mind the clear distinction between the angular\npower spectrum C` and its estimator (27). The former is a theoretical variable which\ncan be calculated from first principles, as we have shown in \u00a72.1. The latter, being a\nfunction of the data, is itself a random variable. In fact, if the a`m 's are Gaussian, then\nwe can rewrite expression (27) as:\n`\nX\n|a`m |2\nX` =\n,\nC\n`\nm=\u2212`\n\n(2` + 1) b\nC ` = X` ,\nC`\n\nwhere X` is a chi-square random variable with 2` + 1 degrees of freedom. According to\nthe central limit theorem, when ` \u2192 \u221e, X` approaches a standard normal variable2 ,\nb` will itself follow a Gaussian distribution. Its mean can be easily\nwhich implies that C\ncalculated using (18) and (27), and is of course given by:\nb` i = C` ,\nhC\nb` 's are unbiased estimators of the C` 's. It is also straightforward\nwhich shows that the C\nto calculate its variance (valid for any `):\nb` \u2212 C` )(C\nb`0 \u2212 C`0 )i =\nh(C\n\n2\nC 2 \u03b4``0 .\n2` + 1 `\n\nBecause this estimator does not couple different cosmological scales, it has the minimum\ncosmic variance we can expect from an estimator due to the finiteness of our sample \u2013\nb` is therefore the best estimator we can build to measure\nso it is optimal in that sense. C\nthe statistical properties of the multipolar coefficients a`m when both statistical isotropy\nand gaussianity hold.\nIn later Sections we will explore angular or harmonic N -point functions for which\nthe assumption of isotropy does not hold. However, it is important to remember at all\ntimes that we have only one map, which means one set of a`m 's. The estimator for the\nb` , takes into account all the a`m 's by dividing them into the\nangular power spectrum, C\ndifferent `'s and summing over all m \u2208 (\u2212`, `). Clearly, it will inherit a sample variance\n2\n\nA standard normal variable is a Gaussian variable X with zero mean and unit variance. Any other\nGaussian variable Y with mean \u03bc and variance \u03c3 can be obtained from X through Y = \u03c3X + \u03bc.\n\n14\n\n\ffor small `'s, when the a`m 's can only be divided into a few \"independent parts\". As\nwe try to estimate higher-order objects such as the N -point functions, we will have\nto subdivide the a`m 's into smaller and smaller subsamples, which are not necessarily\nindependent (in the statistical sense) of each other. So, the price to pay for aiming at\nhigher-order statistics is a worsening of the cosmic sample variance.\n\n2.5\n\nCorrelation and statistical independence\n\nThe covariance given in Eq. (18) has two distinct, important properties. First, note\nthat its diagonal entries, the C` 's, are m-independent coefficients; this is crucial for\nhaving statistical isotropy, as we will show latter. Second, statistical isotropy at the\nGaussian level implies that different cosmological \"scales\" (understood here as meaning\nthe modes with total angular momentum ` and azimuthal momentum m) should be\nstatistically independent of each other \u2013 and this is represented by the Kronecker deltas\nin (18).\nIn fact, statistical independence of cosmological scales is a particular property of\nGaussian and statistically isotropic random fields, and is not guaranteed to hold when\ngaussianity is relaxed. We will see in the next Section that the rotationally invariant\n3-point correlation function (and in general any N > 2 correlation function) couples to\nthe three scales involved. In particular, if it happens that the Gaussian contribution of\nthe temperature field is given by (18), but at least one of its non-Gaussian moments are\nnonzero, then the fact that a particular correlation is zero, like for example ha2m1 a\u22173m2 i,\ndoes not imply that the scales ` = 2 and ` = 3 are (statistically) independent. This\nis just a restatement of the fact that, while statistical independence implies null correlation, the opposite is not necessarily true. This can be illustrated by the following\nexample: consider a random variable \u03b1 distributed as:\n(\n1 \u03b1 \u2208 [0, 1]\nP (\u03b1) =\n0 otherwise .\nLet us now define two other variables x = cos(2\u03c0\u03b1) and y = sin(2\u03c0\u03b1). From these\ndefinitions, it follows that x and y are statistically dependent variables, since knowledge\nof the mean/variance of x automatically gives the mean/variance of y. However, these\nvariables are clearly uncorrelated:\n\u02c6 2\u03c0\n1\nhxyi =\ncos \u03b7 sin \u03b7d\u03b7 = 0 .\n2\u03c0 0\nAlthough correlations are among cosmologist's most popular tools when analyzing CMB\nproperties, statistical independence may turn out to be an important property as well,\nspecially at large angular scales, where cosmic variance is more of a critical issue.\n\n15\n\n\f3\n\nBeyond the standard statistical model\n\nUntil now we have been analyzing the properties of Gaussian and statistically isotropic\nrandom temperature fluctuations. This gives us a fairly good statistical description\nof the Universe in its linear regime, as confirmed by the astonishing success of the\n\u039bCDM model. This picture is incomplete though, and we have good reasons to search\nfor deviations of either gaussianity and/or statistical isotropy. For example, the observed clustering of matter in galactic environments certainly goes beyond the linear\nregime where the central limit theorem can be applied, therefore leading to large deviations of gaussianity in the matter power spectrum statistics. Besides, deviations of\nthe cosmological principle may leave an imprint in the statistical moments of cosmological observables, which can be tested by searching for spatial inhomogeneities [42] or\ndirectionalities [43].\nBut how do we plan to go beyond the standard model, given that there is only one\nGaussian and statistically isotropic description of the Universe, but infinite possibilities otherwise? This is in fact an ambitious endeavor, which may strongly depend on\nobservational and theoretical hints on the type of signatures we are looking for. In the\nabsence of extra input, it is important to classify these signatures in a general scheme,\ndifferentiating those which are non-Gaussian from those which are anisotropic. Furthermore, given that the signatures of non-gaussianity may in principle be quite different\nfrom that of statistical anisotropy, such a classification is crucial for data analysis, which\nrequires sophisticated tools capable of separating these two issues3 .\nWe therefore start \u00a73.1 by analyzing deviations of gaussianity when statistical isotropy\nholds. In \u00a73.2 we keep the hypothesis of gaussianity and analyze the consequences of\nbreaking statistical rotational invariance.\n\n3.1\n3.1.1\n\nNon-Gaussian and SI models\nRotational invariance of N -point correlation functions.\n\nWe turn know to the question of non-Gaussian but statistically isotropic probabilities\ndistributions. We will keep working with the N -point correlation function defined in\nharmonic space,\nha`1 m1 a`2 m2 . . . a`N mN i\n(28)\nsince knowledge of these functions enables one to fully reconstruct the CMB temperature probability distribution. Specifically, we would like to know the form of any\nN -point correlation function which is invariant under arbitrary 3-dimensional spatial\nrotations. When rotated to a new (primed) coordinate system, the N -point correlation\n3\n\nAlthough gaussianity and homogeneity/isotropy are mathematically distinct properties, it is possible for a Gaussian but inhomogeneous/anisotropic model to look like an isotropic and homogeneous\nnon-gaussian model. See for example [44].\n\n16\n\n\ffunction transforms as:\nha`1 m01 a`2 m02 . . . a`N m0N i =\n\nX\n\n`1\n`2\n`n\nha`1 m1 a`2 m2 . . . a`N mN iDm\n0 m Dm0 m . . . Dm0\n1\n2\n1\n\nN mN\n\n2\n\n,\n\n(29)\n\nall m\n`\nwhere the Dm\n0 (\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3)'s are the coefficients of the Wigner rotation-matrix, which\ni mi\ndepend on the three Euler-angles \u03b1, \u03b2 and \u03b3 characterizing the rotation. Notice that\nin this notation the primed (rotated) system is indicated by the primed m's. For the\n2-point correlation function, we have already seen that the well-known expression\n\nha`1 m1 a`2 m2 i = (\u22121)m2 C`1 \u03b4`1 `2 \u03b4m1 ,\u2212m2\ndoes the job:\n!\nX\n\nha`1 m01 a`2 m02 i = C`1\n\n`1\n`1\n(\u22121)m1 Dm\n0 m Dm0 \u2212m\n1\n1\n1\n\n2\n\n\u03b4`1 `2\n\nm1\nm02\n\n= (\u22121)\n\nC`1 \u03b4`1 `2 \u03b4m01 ,\u2212m02 .\n\nNote the importance of the angular spectrum, C` , being a m-independent function.\nWhat about the 3-point function? In this case, the invariant combination is found\nto be:\n\u0012\n\u0013\n`1 `2 `3\nha`1 m1 a`2 m2 a`3 m3 i = B`1 `2 `3\nm1 m2 m3\nwhich can be verified by straightforward calculations. Again, the non-trivial physical content of this statistical moment is contained in an arbitrary but otherwise mindependent function: the bispectrum B`1 `2 `3 [45, 46, 47]. As we anticipated in Section\n2, rotational invariance of the 3-point correlation is not enough to guarantee statistical\nindependence of the three cosmological scales involved in the bispectrum, although in\nprinciple a particular model could be formulated to ensure that B`1 `2 `3 \u221d \u03b4`1 `2 \u03b4`2 `3 , at\nleast for some subset of a general geometric configuration of the 3-point correlation\nfunction.\nThese general properties hold for all the N -point correlation function. For the 4point correlation function, for example, Hu [48] have found the following rotationally\ninvariant combination\n\u0012\n\u0013\u0012\n\u0013\nX\n`1 `2\nL\n`3 `4 L\n`1 `2\nM\nha`1 m1 . . . a`4 m4 i =\nQ`3 `4 (L)(\u22121)\nm1 m2 \u2212M\nm3 m4 M\nLM\n\nwhere the Q``13 ``24 (L) function is known as the trispectrum, and L is an internal angular\nmomentum needed to ensure parity invariance.

Here ~` actually represents the pair (`, m).\n\nThe examples above should be enough to show how the general structure of these functions emerges under SI: apart from a m-independent function, every pair of momenta\n`i in these functions are connected by a triangle, which in turn connects itself to other\ntriangles through internal momenta when more than 3 scales are present. In Fig. 2 we\nshow some diagrams representing the functions above.\nAlthough we have always shown N -point functions which are rotationally invariant,\nthe procedure used for obtaining them was rather intuitive, and therefore does not offer\na recipe for constructing general invariant correlation functions. Furthermore, it does\nnot guarantee that this procedure can be extended for arbitrary N 's. Here we will\npresent a recipe for doing that, which also guarantees the uniqueness of the solution.\nThe general recipe for obtaining the rotationally invariant N -point function is as\nfollows: from the expression (29) above, we start by contracting every pairs of Wigner\nfunctions, where by \"contracting\" we mean using the identity\n\u0013\u0012\n\u0013\nX \u0012 `1 `2\n`1 `2\nL\nL\n`1\n`2\nDm0 m1 (\u03c9)Dm0 m2 (\u03c9) =\n1\n2\nm1 m2 \u2212M 0\nm01 m02 \u2212M\n0\nL,M,M\n\n0\n\nL\n\u00d7(2L + 1)(\u22121)M +M DM\n0 M (\u03c9)\n\nand where \u03c9 = {\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3} is a shortcut notation for the three Euler angles. Once this\ncontraction is done there will remain dN/2e D-functions, which can again be contracted\nin pairs. This procedure should be repeated until there is only one Wigner function\nleft, in which case we will have an expression of the following form:\nX\nX\nL\nha`1 m1 . . . a`N mN i =\nha`1 m01 . . . a`N m0N i \u00d7\ngeometrical factors \u00d7 DM\nM 0 (\u03c9) .\nall m0\n\nNow, we see that the only way for this combination to be rotationally invariant is\nL\nL\nwhen the remaining DM\nM 0 function above does not depend on \u03c9, i.e., DM M 0 (\u03c9) =\n\u03b4L0 \u03b4M 0 \u03b4M 0 0 . Once this identity is applied to the geometrical factors, we are done, and\n18\n\n\fthe remaining terms inside the primed m-summation will give the rotationally invariant\n(N -1)-spectrum.\nAs an illustration of this algorithm, let us construct the rotationally invariant spectrum and bispectrum. For the 2-point function there is only one contraction to be done,\nand after we simplify the last Wigner function we arrive at\n\uf8f9\n\uf8ee\nX h|a`1 m0 |2 i\n1\n\uf8fb (\u22121)m2 \u03b4`1 `2 \u03b4m1 ,\u2212m2 ,\nha`1 m1 a`2 m2 i = \uf8f0\n2`1 + 1\n0\nm1\n\nwhere, of course:\nC` \u2261\n\n1 X\nh|a`m |2 i ,\n2` + 1 m\n\nis the well-known definition of the temperature angular spectrum. For the 3-point\nfunction there are two contractions, and the simplification of the last Wigner function\ngives\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f9\n\u0012\n\u0013 \u0012\n\u0013\nX\n`\n`\n`\n`\n`\n`\n1\n2\n3\n1\n2\n3\n\uf8fb\nha`1 m1 a`2 m2 a`3 m3 i = \uf8f0\nha`1 m01 a`2 m02 a`3 m03 i\n.\nm01 m02 m03\nm1 m2 m3\n0\n0\n0\nm1 ,m2 ,m3\n\nFrom this expression and the ortoghonality of the 3-j's symbols (see the Appendix), we\ncan immediately identify the definition of the bispectrum:\n\u0012\n\u0013\nX\n`1 `2 `3\nB`1 `2 `3 \u2261\nha`1 m1 a`2 m2 a`3 m3 i\n.\nm1 m2 m3\nm1 ,m2 ,m3\n\nIt should be mentioned that this recipe not only enables us to establish the rotational\ninvariance of any N -point correlation function, but it also furnishes a straightforward\ndefinition of unbiased estimators for the N -point functions. All we have to do is to\ndrop the ensemble average of the primed a`m 's. So, for example, for the 2- and 3-point\nfunctions above, the unbiased estimators are given respectively by:\n1 X\nb` =\na`m a\u2217`m\nC\n2` + 1 m\n\u0012\n\u0013\nX\n`1 `2 `3\nb\nB`1 `2 `3 =\na`1 m1 a`2 m2 a`3 m3\n.\nm1 m2 m3\nm1 ,m2 ,m3\n\nNotice that isotropy plays the same role, in S 2 , that homogeneity plays in R3 . What\nenforces homogeneity in R3 is the Fourier-space \u03b4-functions, as in the discussion around\nFig. 1. However, in S 2 the equivalent of the Fourier modes are the harmonic modes,\nfor which there is only a discrete notion of orthogonality \u2013 and no Dirac \u03b4-function.\nWhat we found above is that the Wigner 3-j symbols play the same role as the Fourier\nspace \u03b4-functions: they are the enforcers of isotropy (rotational invariance) for the\nN -point angular correlation function. Hence, the diagrammatic representations of the\nconstituents of the N -point functions in Fourier (Fig. 1) and in harmonic space (Fig.\n2) really do convey the same physical idea \u2013 one in R3 , the other in S 2 .\n19\n\n\f3.2\n\nGaussian and Statistically Anisotropic models\n\nIn the last section, we have developed an algorithm which enables one to establish the\nrotational invariance of any N -point correlation function. As we have shown, this is\nalso an algorithm for building unbiased estimators of non-Gaussian correlations. In this\nsection we will change the perspective and analyze the case of Gaussian but statistically\nanisotropic models of the Universe.\nThere are many ways in which statistical anisotropy may be manifested in CMB.\nFrom a fundamental perspective, a short phase of inflation which produces just enough\ne-folds to solve the standard Big Bang problems may leave imprints on the largest\nscales of the Universe, provided that the spacetime is sufficiently anisotropic at the\nonset of inflation [39]. Another source of anisotropy may result from our inability\nto efficiently clean foreground contaminations from temperature maps. Usually, the\ncleaning procedure involves the application of a mask function in order to eliminate\ncontaminations of the galactic plane from raw data. As a consequence, this procedure\nmay either induce, as well as hide some anomalies in CMB maps [28].\nIt is important to mention that these two examples can be perfectly treated as\nGaussian: in the first case, the anisotropy of the spacetime can be established in the\nlinear regime of perturbation theory, and therefore will not destroy gaussianity of the\nquantum modes, provided that they are initially Gaussian. In the second case, the mask\nacts linearly over the temperature maps, therefore preserving its probability distribution\n[49].\n3.2.1\n\nPrimordial anisotropy\n\nRecently, there have been many attempts to test the isotropy of the primordial Universe\nthrough the signatures of an anisotropic inflationary phase [38, 39, 40, 50, 51]. A generic\nprediction of such models is the linear coupling of the scalar, vector and tensor modes\nthrough the spatial shear, which is in turn induced by anisotropy of the spacetime [38].\nWhenever that happens, the matter power spectrum, defined in a similar way as in Eq.\n(12), will acquire a directionality dependence due to this type of see-saw mechanism.\nThis dependence can be accommodated in a harmonic expansion of the form:\nX\nP (~k) =\nr`m (k)Y`m (k\u0302) ,\n(30)\n`,m\n\u2217\nwhere the reality of P (~k) requires that r`m (k) = (\u22121)m r`,\u2212m\n(k). Given that temperature\nperturbations \u0398(~x) are real, their Fourier components must satisfy the relation \u0398(~k) =\n\u0398\u2217 (\u2212~k). This property taken together with the definition (12) implies that:\n\nP (~k) = P (\u2212~k) ,\n\n(31)\n\nwhich in turn restricts the `'s in (30) to even values. Also, note that by relaxing the\nassumption of spatial isotropy, we are only breaking a continuous spacetime symmetry,\n20\n\n\fbut discrete symmetries such as parity should still be present in this class of models.\nIndeed, by imposing invariance of the spectrum under the transformation z \u2192 \u2212z,\nwe find that (\u22121)`\u2212m = 1. Similarly, invariance under the transformations x \u2192 \u2212x\nand y \u2192 \u2212y imply the conditions r`m = (\u22121)m r`,\u2212m and r`m = r`,\u2212m , respectively.\nGathering all these constraints with the parity of `, we conclude that\nr`m \u2208 R,\n\n`, m \u2208 2N .\n\n(32)\n\nThat is, from the initial 2` + 1 degrees of freedom, only `/2 + 1 of them contribute to\nthe anisotropic spectrum [39].\n3.2.2\n\nSignatures of statistical anisotropies\n\nThe selection rules (32) are the most generic predictions we can expect from models\nwith global break of anisotropy. We will now work out the consequences of these rules\nto the temperature power spectrum, and check whether they can say something about\nthe CMB large scale anomalies.\nFrom the expressions (16) and (30) we can immediately calculate the most general\nanisotropic covariance matrix [37]:\nX\n`1 `2 `3\nha`1 m1 a\u2217`2 m2 i =\nGm\nH``13`m2 3 ,\n(33)\n1 m2 m3\n`3 ,m3\n\nwhere:\nr\n`1 `2 `3\nGm\n1 m2 m3\n\nm1\n\n= (\u22121)\n\n(2`1 + 1)(2`2 + 1)(2`3 + 1)\n4\u03c0\n\n\u0012\n\n`1 `2 `3\n0 0 0\n\n\u0013\u0012\n\n`1\n`2 `3\n\u2212m1 m2 m3\n\n\u0013\n,\n\n(34)\nare the Gaunt coefficients resulting from the integral of three spherical harmonics (see\nthe Appendix). These coefficients are zero unless the following conditions are met:\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\u2208 2N\n\uf8f2`1 + `2 + `3\n(35)\nm1 + m2 + m3\n=0\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\n|`i \u2212 `j | \u2264 `k \u2264 `i + `j \u2200i, j, k \u2208 {1, 2, 3} .\nThe remaining coefficients in (33) are given by:\n\u02c6 \u221e\n`3 m3\n`1 \u2212`2\nH`1 `2 = 4\u03c0i\nd log k r`3 m3 (k)j`1 (kR)j`2 (kR) ,\n0\n\nand correspond to the anisotropic generalization of temperature power spectrum (18).\nThe selection rules (35), taken together with (32), lead to important signatures in\nthe CMB. In particular, since `3 is even, the quantity `1 \u00b1 `2 must also be even, i.e.,\nmultipoles with different parity do not couple to each other in this class of models:\nha`1 m1 a\u2217`2 m2 i = 0 ,\n21\n\n`1 + `2 = odd .\n\n(36)\n\n\fThis result is in fact expected on theoretical grounds, because by breaking a continuous\nsymmetry (isotropy) we cannot expect to generate a discrete signature (parity) in CMB.\nHowever, notice that the absence of correlations between, say, the quadrupole and the\noctupole, does not imply that there will be no alignment between them. One example\nof this would be a covariance matrix of the form C`m \u03b4``0 \u03b4mm0 . If the C`,0 happen to be\nzero, for example, then all multipoles will present a preferred direction (in this case,\nthe z-axis.)\n3.2.3\n\nIsotropic signature of statistical anisotropy\n\nWe have just shown that a generic consequence of an early anisotropic phase of the\nUniverse is the generation of even-parity signatures in CMB maps. Interestingly, these\nsignatures may be present even in the isotropic angular spectrum, since the C` 's acquire\nsome additional modulations in the presence of statistical anisotropies. In principle,\nthese modulations could be constrained by measuring an effective angular spectrum of\nthe form\nX\n```0\n`0 0\nGm,\u2212m,0\nH``\n,\n(37)\nha`m a\u2217`m i = C` + \u000f\n`0 >0\n\nwhere we have introduced a small \u000f parameter to quantify the amount of primordial\nanisotropy.\nIn order to constrain these modulations we have to build a statistical estimator for\nha`m a\u2217`m i. Since we are looking for the diagonal entries of the matrix (33), a first guess\nwould be\n`\nX\nbeff = 1\nC\na`m a\u2217`m .\n(38)\n`\n2` + 1 m=\u2212`\nTo check whether this is an unbiased estimator of the effective angular spectrum, we\napply it to (33) and take its average:\nX\n```0\n`0 0\nGm,\u2212m,0\nH``\n.\nhC`eff i = C` + \u000f\n`0 >0,m\n\nUsing the definition (34) of the Gaunt coefficients, the m-summation in the expression\nabove becomes [41]\n\u0012\n\u0013\nX\n\u221a\n`\n` `0\n`\u2212m\n(\u22121)\n= 2` + 1\u03b4`0 ,0 = 0\nm \u2212m 0\nm\n\nwhere the last equality follows because `0 > 0. Consequently we conclude that\nb`eff i = C` 6= ha`m a\u2217`m i .\nhC\nAt first sight, this result may seem innocuous, showing only that this is not an appropriate estimator for (37). Note however that (38) is in fact the estimator of the angular\n22\n\n\fspectrum usually applied to CMB data under the assumption of statistical isotropy.\nIn other words, by means of the usual procedure we may be neglecting important information about statistical anisotropy. Moreover, the cosmic variance induced by the\napplication of this estimator on anisotropic CMB maps is small, because, as it can easily\nbe checked:\n2\nbeff \u2212 C` )(C\nbeff\nC 2 \u03b4``0 + O(\u000f2 ) .\nh(C\n`\n`0 \u2212 C`0 )i =\n2` + 1 `\nThis result shows that the construction of statistical estimators strongly depends on\nour prejudices about what non-gaussianity and statistical anisotropy should look like.\nConsequently, an estimator built to measure one particular property of the CMB may\nequally well hide other important signatures. One possible solution to this problem is\nto let the construction of our estimators be based on what the observations seem to tell\nus, as we will do in the next Section.\n\n23\n\n\fPart II\n\nCosmological Tests\nSo much for mathematical formalism. We will now turn to the question of how the\nhypotheses of gaussianity and statistical isotropy of the Universe can be tested. Though\nwe are primarily interested in applying these tests to CMB temperature maps, most\nof the tools we shall be dealing with can be applied to polarization (E- and B-mode\nmaps) and to catalogs of large-scale structures as well.\nTesting the gaussianity and SI of our Universe is a difficult task. Specially because,\nas we have seen, there is only one Gaussian and SI Universe, but infinitely many universes which are neither Gaussian nor isotropic. So what type of non-gaussianity and\nstatistical anisotropy should we test for? In order to attack this problem we can follow\ntwo different routes. In the bottom-up approach, models for the cosmic evolution are\nformulated in such a way as to account for some specific deviations from gaussianity and\nSI. These physical principles range from non-trivial cosmic topologies [52, 53, 54], primordial magnetic fields [55, 56, 57, 58, 59], local [60, 43, 61, 62] and global [38, 39, 40, 50]\nmanifestation of anisotropy, to non-minimal inflationary models [51, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67].\nThe main advantage of the bottom-up approach is that we know exactly what feature\nof the CMB is being measured. One of its drawbacks is the plethora of different models\nand mechanisms that can be tested.\nThe second possibility is the top-down, or model-independent approach. Here, we\nare not concerned with the mechanisms responsible for deviations of gaussianity or SI,\nbut rather with the qualitative features of any such deviation. Once these features are\nunderstood, we can use them as a guide for model building. Examples here include\nconstructs of a posteriori statistics [29, 35, 36] and functional modifications of the twopoint correlation function [28, 37, 68, 69, 70, 71].\nIn the next section we will explore two different model-independent tests: one based\non functional modifications of the two-point correlation function, and another one based\non the so-called Maxwell's multipole vectors.\n\n4\n\nMultipole vectors\n\nMultipole vectors were first introduced in cosmology by Copi et al. [23] as a new\nmathematical representation for the primordial temperature field, where each of its\nmultipoles ` are represented by ` unit real vectors. Later it was realized that this idea\nis in fact much older [72], being proposed originally by J. C. Maxwell in his Treatise on\nElectricity and Magnetism.\nThe power of this approach is that the multipole vectors can be entirely calculated\nin terms of a temperature map, without any reference to external reference frames.\nThis make them ideal tools to test the morphology of CMB maps, like the quadrupoleoctupole alignment.\n24\n\n\fThe purpose of the following presentation is only comprehensiveness. A mathematically rigorous introduction to the subject can be found in references [73, 72, 74], as\nwell as other review articles in this review volume.\n\n4.1\n\nMaxwell's representation of harmonic functions\n\nWe start our presentation of the multipole vectors by recalling some terminology. A\nharmonic function in three dimensions is any (twice differentiable) function h that\nsatisfies Laplace's equation:\n\u22072 h = 0 ,\n(39)\nwhere \u22072 is the Laplace operator. In spherical coordinates, the formal solution to\nLaplace's equation which is regular at the origin (r = 0) is:\nh=\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nh` (r, \u03b8, \u03c6) ,\n\nh` =\n\n`\nX\n\na`m r` Y`m (\u03b8, \u03c6) .\n\n(40)\n\nm=\u2212`\n\n`=0\n\nThe functions r` Y`m are known as the solid spherical harmonics [74]. Since they agree\nwith the usual spherical harmonics on the unit sphere, it is sometimes stated in the literature that the latter form a set of harmonic functions. This is an abuse of nomenclature\nthough, and the reader should be careful.\nGiven the scalar nature of Laplace's operator, it is possible to find solutions to\nEq.(39) in terms of Cartesian coordinates. Such solutions can be constructed by combining homogeneous polynomials4 of order `:\nh=\n\n\u221e\nX\n`=0\n\nh` (x, y, z) ,\n\nh` =\n\n`\nX\n\n\u03bbabc xa y b z c ,\n\n(a + b + c = `) .\n\n(41)\n\nabc\n\nIn three dimensions, the most general homogeneous polynomial of order ` contains\n(` + 2)!/(2!`!) independent coefficients. However, since each polynomial must independently satisfy Eq. (39), precisely `!/(2!(` \u2212 2)!) of these coefficients will depend on each\nother. This constraint leaves us with (` + 1)(` + 2)/2 \u2212 `(` \u2212 1)/2 = 2` + 1 independent degrees of freedom in each multipole ` \u2013 which is, of course, the same number of\nindependent degrees of freedom appearing in Eq. (40).\nBased on this analysis, Maxwell introduced his own representation of harmonic\nfunctions. He noticed that by successively applying directional\nderivatives of the form\np\n2\n~v * \u2207 \u2261 \u2207~v over the monopole potential 1/r, where r = x + y 2 + z 2 and ~v is a unit\nvector, he could construct solutions of the form (41). That is:\nf` (x, y, z) = \u03bb` \u2207~v` . . . \u2207~v2 \u2207~v1\n4\n\n1\nr\n\n,\nr=1\n\nA homogeneous polynomial is a sum of monomials, all of the same order.\n\n25\n\n(42)\n\n\fwhere \u03bb` are real constants. We are now going to show that this construction does indeed\nlead to solutions of the form (41). First, note that there is a pattern which emerges\nfrom successive application of directional derivatives over the monopole function:\nf0 =\n\n1\nr\n\n\u2212~v1 * ~r\nr3\n3(~v2 * ~r)(~v1 * ~r) \u2212 r2 (~v1 * ~v2 )\n= \u2207~v2 f1 =\n,\nr3\n\nf1 = \u2207~v1 f0 =\nf2\n\n(43)\n\nand so on. By induction, one can show that the general expression will be given by:\nQ\n(\u22121)` (2` \u2212 1)!! `i=1 ~vi * ~r + r2 Q`\u22122\n,\n(44)\nf` =\nr2`+1\nwhere Q`\u22122 is a homogeneous polynomial of order `\u22122 which only involves combinations\nof the vectors ~vi and ~r.\nThe numerator of the function f` given by (44) is clearly a homogeneous polynomial of order ` (as one can easily check for some `'s and also prove by mathematical\ninduction.) A not so obvious result is that this polynomial is also harmonic. To prove\nthat, let us define:\n`\nY\n`\ng` = (\u22121) (2` \u2212 1)!!\n~vi * ~r + r2 Q`\u22122 ,\n(45)\ni=1\n\nand consider the application of the operator \u22072 over the combination r\u03b1 g` . For the\nx-component we get:\n\u2202x2 (r\u03b1 g` ) = r\u03b1 \u2202x2 g` + 2\u03b1r\u03b1\u22122 x\u2202x g` + [\u03b1r\u03b1\u22122 + \u03b1(\u03b1 \u2212 2)x2 r\u03b1\u22124 ]g` .\nRepeating this process for the y- and z-components and then adding the results, we\nfind:\n\u22072 (r\u03b1 g` ) = r\u03b1 \u22072 g` + 2\u03b1r\u03b1\u22122 (x\u2202x g` + y\u2202y g` + z\u2202z g` ) + \u03b1(\u03b1 + 1)r\u03b1\u22122 g`\n= r\u03b1 \u22072 g` + \u03b1(\u03b1 + 2` + 1)(r\u03b1\u22122 g` ) ,\nwhere in the last step we have used Euler's theorem on homogeneous functions, i.e.,\n~r * \u2207g` = `g` . If we now choose \u03b1 = \u2212(2` + 1), we find immediately that\n\u22072\n\n\u0010 g \u0011 \u22072 g\n`\n`\n= 2`+1 .\n2`+1\nr\nr\n\nBy construction, the left-hand side of the above expression is equal to \u22072 f` . But\naccording to the definition (42) this quantity is also zero, since Laplace's operator\ncommutes with directional derivatives and \u22072 (1/r) = 0 for r > 0. Therefore, \u22072 g` = 0\nand g` is harmonic, which completes our proof.\n26\n\n\fIn conclusion, Maxwell's construction of harmonic functions, Eq. (42), is completely\nequivalent to the standard representation in terms of spherical harmonics. More importantly, this gives a one-to-one relationship between temperature maps (given by the\na`m 's) and ` unit vectors ~vi . This means that the multipole vectors can be directly\ncalculated from a CMB map, without any reference to external reference frames or\nadditional geometrical constructs. The reader interested in algorithms to construct the\nvectors from CMB maps may check references [23, 72], as well as the other articles in\nthis volume that review this approach.\n\n4.2\n\nMultipole vectors statistics\n\nIt should be clear from the discussion above that the multipole vectors give an intuitive\nway to discover, interpret and visualize phase correlations between different multipoles\nin the CMB maps. But they also can reveal intra-multipole features, such as planarity\n(when a given multipole presents a preferred plane.) Some of the most conspicuous\nhints of statistical anisotropy in the CMB, like the quadrupole-octupole alignment,\nhave indeed been first found with less mathematically elegant methods [22, 27], but are\nbest described in terms of the multipole vector formalism [23, 24, 26, 72]. However,\nthis case should also sound an alarm, because some feature of a (presumably) random\nrealization was found, then further scrutinized with a certain test which was, to some\nextent (intentionally or not) tailored to single out that very feature.\nThe pitfalls of aprioristic approaches are sometimes unavoidable, and all we can do\nis take a second look at our sample with a more generic set of tools, to try to assess how\nsignificant our result really is in the context of a larger set of statistical tests. Multipole\nvectors are, in fact, ideally suited to this, since they can be found for all multipoles,\nand it is relatively easy to construct scalar combinations of these vectors with the usual\nmethods of linear algebra. Also convenient is the fact that simulating these vectors\nfrom maps, or even directly, is also relatively easy, so the standard model of a Gaussian\nrandom field can be easily translated into the pdf's for the tests constructed with the\nmultipole vectors. An important drawback of the multipole vectors is that, because\nthey are computed in terms of equations which are non-linear in the temperature fields,\nthe distribution functions of statistical tests involving these vectors are highly nonGaussian [75]. This means that these statistics usually have to be estimated by means of\nsimulations (usually assuming that the underlying temperature field is itself Gaussian.)\nAnother delicate issue is how stable the multipole vectors are to instrumental noise\nand sky cut \u2013 and here, again, we must rely on numerical simulations to compare the\nobservations with theoretical models.\nIn order to see how one should go about constructing a general set of tests, it\nshould be noted first that the multipole vectors define directions, but they have no\nsense (they are \"headless vectors\".) This follows from the fact that the sign of the\nconstants \u03bb` are degenerate with the sign of the vectors ~v`,p (p = 1, . . . , ` .) Hence, the\nfirst requirement is that our tests should be independent of this sign ambiguity. Notice\nthat this ambiguity extends to ancillary constructs such as the normal vectors, defined\n27\n\n\fas the vector product:\nw\n~ `,pp0 \u2261 ~v`,p \u2297 ~v`,p0 .\n\n(46)\n\nMathematically, the sign ambiguity implies that the multipole vectors belong to the\nquotient space S 2 /Z2 (also known as RP 2 ), while the normal vectors belong to R3 /Z2 .\nIn principle, any positive-definite scalar constructed through the multipole or the\nnormal vectors is \"fair game\", but there are some guidelines, e.g., one should avoid\ndouble-counting the same degrees of freedom. Below we review some of these tests,\nbased on the work of Ref. [35].\n4.2.1\n\nThe R statistic\n\nThe first example of a test involving the multipole vectors would be a scalar product,\nsuch as ~v * ~v 0 . The most natural test would involve asking whether the ` multipole\nvectors of the given multipole ` are especially aligned or not. This means computing:\n`\nX\n2\nR`` =\n|~v`,p * ~v`,p0 | ,\n`(` \u2212 1) p,p0 >p\n\n(47)\n\nwhere the normalization was introduced to make 0 \u2264 R`` \u2264 1.\nThis idea could be generalized to test alignments between multipole vectors at different multipoles:\n1 X\n|~v`,p * ~v`0 ,p0 | .\n(48)\nR``0 = 0\n`` p,p0\nIn fact, the quadrupole-octupole alignment can already be seen with this simple test:\nfor essentially all CMB maps the significance of the alignment as measured by R23 is of\nthe order of 90-95% C.L. [35].\n4.2.2\n\nThe S statistic\n\nThe second most natural test does not involve directly the multipole vectors themselves,\nbut the normal vectors that can be produced by taking the vector product between the\nmultipole vectors. So, we take:\nw\n~ `,pp0 = ~v`,p \u2297 ~v`0 ,p0 .\n\n(49)\n\nNotice that the number of normal vectors for a given multipole ` is l = `(` \u2212 1)/2 \u2013\nso the number of normal vectors grows rapidly for larger multipoles, making it harder\nto use and meaning that the same degrees of freedom may be overcounted, at least for\n` > 3.\nAgain, the best strategy is simplicity: we can ask whether the normal vectors are\naligned, within and between multipoles. This means computing:\nl\nX\n2\n|w\n~ `,p * w\n~ `,p0 | ,\nS`` =\nl(l \u2212 1) p,p0 >p\n\n28\n\n(50)\n\n\fwhere the normalization was introduced again to make 0 \u2264 S`` \u2264 1.\nAnd yet again this idea is easily generalized to test alignments between normal\nvectors at different multipoles:\nS``0 =\n\n1 X\n|w\n~ `,p * w\n~ `0 ,p0 | .\nll0 p,p0\n\n(51)\n\nWith this test, the quadrupole-octupole alignment is much more significant: for essentially all CMB maps the test S23 deviates from the expected range with 98% C.L.\n[35].\n4.2.3\n\nOther tests with multipole vectors\n\nOne can go on and expand the types of tests using both multipole and normal vectors.\nOne idea would be, e.g., to disregard the moduli of the normal vectors:\nD``0 =\n\n1 X\n|\u0175`,p * \u0175`0 ,p0 | .\nll0 p,p0\n\n(52)\n\nThis test is therefore insensitive to the relative angle between the multipole vectors\nthat produce any given normal vectors. This idea is similar to the planar modulations\nthat will be discussed in the next Section. With this test, the quadrupole-octupole\nalignment is significant to about 95-98% C.L. This test can also be generalized to a\nself-alignment test (` = `0 ), with just an adjustment to the normalization.\nAnother possibility would be to measure the alignment between multipole vectors\nand normal vectors:\n1 X\n|~v`,p * w\n~ `0 ,p0 | .\n(53)\nB``0 = 0\n`l p,p0\nOf course, this test cannot be easily generalized to a self-alignment. With the B23 test,\nthe quadrupole-octupole alignment is significant to about 95-98% C.L.\nWe could go on here, but it should be clear that all the information (the 2` + 1 real\ndegrees of freedom for each multipole `) has already been exhausted in the tests above.\n\n5\n\nTemperature correlation function\n\nDespite their strong cosmological appeal, the multipole vectors have some limitations.\nNot only their directions in the CMB sky are sometimes difficult to interpret physically [26], they also have the additional drawback of mixing, in a non-trivial manner,\ninformation on both gaussianity and SI of the map being analyzed [26, 75].\nAnother way of quantifying deviations in the standard statistical framework of cosmology is through functional modifications of the two-point correlation function [37, 68].\nAlthough this approach does not offer an optimal separation between gaussianity and\nSI (which is, by the way, an open problem in this field), working with the two-point\n29\n\n\fcorrelation function makes it easier to test Gaussian models of statistical anisotropy\n[71, 28].\nThe most general 2-point correlation function (2pcf) of two independent unit vectors\nis a function C of the form\nC : S2 \u00d7 S2 \u2192 R .\nWe have seen in \u00a72.3 that, if we choose spherical coordinates (\u03b8i , \u03c6i ) to describe each\nvector n\u0302i , the function above can be decomposed either in terms of two spherical har. In any case, the 2pcf\nmonics Y`i mi or in terms of the bipolar spherical harmonic Y`LM\n1 `2\nwill have the following functional dependence\nC = C(\u03b81 , \u03c61 , \u03b82 , \u03c62 ) .\n\n(54)\n\nThis function is absolutely general. If the Universe has any cosmological deviation\nof isotropy, whatever it is, it can be described by the function above (see also Fig.(5)).\n\n^\nn\n1\n\n(\u03bc1 ,'1 )\n(\u03bc2 ,'2 )\n\n^\nn\n2\n\nFigure 3: Geometrical representation of the 2pcf in terms of two unit vectors.\nUnfortunately, this function will be of limited theoretical interest unless we have\nsome hints on how to select its relevant degrees of freedom. This difficulty is in fact\na general characteristic of model-independent tools, which at some stages forces us to\nrely on our theoretical prejudices about the statistical nature of the Universe in order\nto construct estimators of non-gaussianity and/or statistical anisotropy. Nonetheless,\nit is still possible to construct statistical estimators of anisotropy based on Eq.(54).\nFor example, Hajian and Souradeep [68] have constructed an unbiased estimator \u03ba` for\nthis function based solely on the requirement that this estimator should be rotationally\ninvariant. Although it is true that any statistically significant \u03ba` > 0 will point towards\nanisotropy, it is not clear what type of anisotropy is being detected by this estimator.\nWe can still use Eq. (54) to search for deviations of SI if we restrict its domain to\na smaller and non-trivial sub-domain. For example, we can take the vectors n\u03021 and n\u03022\n30\n\n\fto be the same, and expand a function of the form\nC = C(\u03b81 , \u03c61 ) .\n\n(55)\n\nwhich is equivalent to C : S 2 \u2192 R. This form of the 2pcf makes it ideal for searching\nfor power multipole moments in CMB, once a suitable estimator is defined [37]. Unfortunately, when we take n\u03021 = n\u03022 we are in fact considering a one-point correlation\nfunction, which by construction does not allows us to measure correlations between\ndifferent points in the sky.\nIt seems in principle that the functions (55) and (54) are the only possibilities besides\nthe isotropic 2pcf Eq.(22). If not, what other combinations of the vectors n\u03021 and n\u03022\ncan we consider? As a matter of fact, these two vectors are geometrical quantities\nintuitively bound to our notion of two-point correlation functions on the sphere. From\nthis perspective they are not fundamental quantities. In fact, we can equally well\nrepresent the 2pcf by a disc living inside the unit sphere, as shown in Fig. 4\n\n^\nn\n\n^\nn1\n\n^\nn2\n\n(\u00a3;\u00a9)\n\n\u03bc\n'\n\nFigure 4: Geometrical representation of the 2pcf in terms of a unit disc (or plane).\nIn this representation, \u03b8 is the angle between the vectors n\u03021 and n\u03022 , as usual. The\nnormal to the plane, n\u0302, is represented by two spherical angles (\u0398, \u03a6). Finally, there is an\noverall orientation \u03c6 of the disc around its unit vector which completes the four degrees\nof freedom contained in Eq.(54). We have found therefore another valid geometrical\nrepresentation of the most general 2pcf:\nC = C(\u0398, \u03a6, \u03b8, \u03c6)\n\n(56)\n\nThe main advantage of the above representation when compared to (54) is its\nstraightforward geometrical interpretation. First, note that the angular separation\n\u03b8 of the isotropic 2pcf is trivially included in this definition, and do not need to be\nobtained as a consequence of rotational invariance (see the discussion in \u00a73.1.1.) Second, by characterizing the correlation function in terms of the geometrical components\n31\n\n\fof a disc, we know exactly what are the degrees of freedom involved. This makes it\neasier to construct estimators of statistical anisotropy, alleviating the drawbacks of\nmodel-independent approaches mentioned above.\n\n5.1\n\nAnisotropy through planarity\n\nAn immediate application of the representation (56) is its use in the search for planar\ndeviations of isotropy in CMB [71, 28]. Planar modulations of astrophysical origin\nmay play an important role to the CMB morphology. One example is the role played\nby the galactic and ecliptic plane in the quadrupole-octupole/north-south anomalies\n[26]. Also, it is well known that our galactic plane is sensible source of foreground\ncontamination in the construction of cleaned CMB maps. These hints indicate that\nCMB modulations induced by the disc in Fig. 4 is not only a mathematical possibility,\nbut perhaps also a symmetry of cosmological relevance.\nSince we are primarily interested in measuring planar modulations of CMB, but\nincluding the usual angular modulation as the isotropic limit of the 2pcf, we can consider\nonly the azimuthal average of Eq. (56):\n\u02c6 2\u03c0\n1\nC(\u0398, \u03a6, \u03b8, \u03c6)d\u03c6 .\n(57)\nC\u2192\n2\u03c0 0\nThe resulting function can be easily expand in terms of simple special functions as\nX X 2` + 1\n\u221a\nC(\u0398, \u03a6, \u03b8) =\nC`lm P` (cos \u03b8)Ylm (\u0398, \u03a6) , l \u2208 2N\n(58)\n4\u03c0\n` l,m\nwhere the restriction on the l-mode results from the symmetry n\u03021 \u2194 n\u03022 [76]. The\nmultipolar coefficients C`lm correspond to a generalization of the usual angular power\nspectrum C` 's. In fact, they can be seen as the coefficients of a spherical harmonic\ndecomposition of the function C` (n\u0302), provided that this function suffers modulations as\nwe sweep planes on the sphere.\n5.1.1\n\nAngular-planar power spectrum\n\nSince we are restricting our analysis to the Gaussian framework, the set of coefficients\nC`lm is all we need to characterize the two-point correlation function. However, the\nfinal product of CMB observations are temperature maps, and not correlation maps.\nWhat we need then is an algebraic relation between the multipolar coefficients C`lm and\nthe temperature coefficients a`m defined in Eq.(3). At first sight, this relation could\nbe obtained by equating expression (58) to its standard definition in Eq. (20), and\nthen using the orthogonality of the special functions to isolate the C`lm 's in terms of the\na`m 's. But for that to work we need the relation between the set of angles (\u0398, \u03a6, \u03b8)\nand (\u03b81 , \u03c61 , \u03b82 , \u03c62 ) which, depending on the reference frame we choose, is extremely\ncomplicated. Fortunately, all we need is the relation:\nn\u03021 * n\u03022 = cos \u03b8 = cos \u03b81 cos \u03b82 + sin \u03b81 sin \u03b82 cos(\u03c61 \u2212 \u03c62 ) ,\n32\n\n(59)\n\n\ftogether with a suitable choice of our coordinate system. For example, we can use the\ninvariance of the scalar product n\u03021 * n\u03022 and choose our coordinate system such that the\ndisc of Fig. 4 lie in the xy plane. With this choice we will have:\n(\u0398, \u03a6) = (0, 0) ,\n\ncos \u03b8 = cos(\u03c61 \u2212 \u03c62 ) ,\n\nand the integration over \u03b8 becomes simple. Once this is done, we make a passive\nrotation of the coordinate system and then we integrate over the remaining angles \u0398\nand \u03a6, which will then be given precisely by the Euler angles used in the rotation. The\ndetails are rather technical and can be found in the Appendix. The final expression is:\n\u0012\n\u0013\nX X\n(\u22121)m C`lm\nl\n`1 `2\n\u221a\n(60)\n= 2\u03c0\nha`1 m2 a`2 m2 i\nI`l,`1 `2 ,\n\u2212m\nm\nm\n1\n2\n2l + 1\n`1 ,m1 `2 ,m2\nwhere\nI`l,`1 `2\n\n\u2261\n\nX\nm\n\nm\n\n(\u22121) \u03bb`1 m \u03bb`2 m\n\n\u0012\n\nl `1 `2\n0 m \u2212m\n\n\u0013\u02c6\n\n\u03c0\n\nd(\u2212 cos \u03b8) P` (cos \u03b8)eim\u03b8 ,\n\n(61)\n\n0\n\nand where the \u03bb`i m 's form a set of coefficients resulting from the \u03b8 integration, which\nare zero unless `i + m = even (see the Appendix for more details).\nExpression (60) is what we were looking for. With this relation, the angular-planar\npower spectrum C`lm can be calculated from first principles for any model predicting a\nspecific covariance matrix. Moreover, since the angular-planar function (58) is, after all,\na correlation function, it should be possible to relate the angular-planar power spectrum\nC`lm to the bipolar power spectrum ALM\n`1 `2 of Hajian and Souradeep. In fact, by inverting\nexpression (26) and plugging the result in (60), we find a linear relation between these\ntwo set of coefficients:\nX\n`1 \u2212`2\nC`lm = 2\u03c0\nAlm\n(2l + 1) I`l,`\n.\n`1 `2 (\u22121)\n1 `2\n`1 ,`2\n\nHere, the set of geometrical coefficients I`l,`\nplays a similar role to the 3-j symbols\n1 `2\nin expression (26). Note also the angular-planar power spectrum has only three free\nindices, while the bipolar power spectrum has four. This is a consequence of the azimuthal average we took in (57), which further constrains the degrees of freedom of the\ncorrelation function.\n5.1.2\n\nStatistical estimators and \u03c72 analysis\n\nWe have shown that the angular-planar power spectrum (60) is given in terms of an\nensemble average of temperature maps. Evidently, we cannot calculate it directly from\ndata, for we have only one CMB map (the one taken from our own Universe.) The best\nwe can do is to estimate the statistical properties of (60), like its mean and variance,\n33\n\n\fand see whether these quantities agree, in the statistical sense, with what we would\nexpect to obtain from a particular model of the Universe.\nThe reader should note that this procedure is not new \u2013 its limitation is due to the\nsame cosmic variance which lead us to construct an estimator for the angular power\nspectrum C` (see the discussion of \u00a72.4). For the same reason, we will need to construct\nan estimator for the angular-planar power spectrum. An obvious choice is:\n\u0012\n\u0013\nX X\n\u221a\nl `1 `2\nlm\nb\n(62)\nC` \u2261 2\u03c0 2l + 1\na`1 m1 a`2 m2\nI`l,`1 `2 ,\nm m1 m2\n`1 ,m1 `2 ,m2\n\nfor in this case we have an unbiased estimator,\nhCb`lm i = C`lm ,\nregardless of the underlying model.\nIf we now have a model predicting the angular-planar power spectrum, we can ask\nhow good this model fit the observational data once it is calculated using (62). All we\nneed is a simple chi-square (\u03c72 ) goodness-of-fit test, which in our case can be written\nin the following generalized form:\n(\u03c72\u03bd )l` \u2261\n\nl\nX\n|Cb`lm \u2212 C`lm |2\n1\n,\n2l + 1 m=\u2212l\n(\u03c3`lm )2\n\n(63)\n\nin which ` and l are the angular and planar degrees of freedom, respectively, and where\n\u03c3`lm is just the standard deviation of the estimator Cb`lm . The (2l + 1)\u22121 factor accounts\nfor the 2l + 1 planar degrees of freedom, and was introduced for latter convenience.\nIn \u00a77 we will apply this test to the 5-year WMAP temperature maps in order to\ncheck the robustness of the \u039bCDM model against the hypothesis of SI. Before that, we\nshall stop and digress a little about how observational uncertainties should be included\nin our analysis.\n\n34\n\n\fTheory v. Observations: cosmic and statistical variances\n\n6\n\nUntil now we have been concerned with the formal aspects of non-Gaussian and statistically anisotropic universes, and how model-independent tests might be designed to\ndetect deviations of either gaussianity or statistical isotropy. We will now discuss how\nsuch tests can be carried out and interpreted once we possess cosmological data.\nIn a great variety of tests, statistical tools are designed to detect particular deviations of gaussianity or SI from cosmological data like, for example, the CMB. The final\noutcome of these tests is usually a probability (a pure number), which should be interpreted as the chance that a Universe like ours might result from an ensemble of \"equally\nprepared\" Gaussian and SI universes. An anomaly in CMB is usually understood as a\nmeasure of how unlikely is a particular feature of our Universe according to this specific\ntest. The multipole vector statistics, for example, when applied to a large number of\nsimulated (Gaussian and SI) CMB maps, show that only \u223c 0.01% of these maps have\na quadrupole-octupole alignment as strong as WMAP maps [26, 23].\nThere are two points to keep in mind when carrying this type of analysis. The first\nis that a particular \"detection\" may always turn out to be a statistical fluctuation revealed by one specific tool. The robustness of an anomaly then depend on the number\nof independent tests pointing to the same result. The second is that the implementation\nof statistical tools is sensitive to the way we extract information from data, requiring an\naccurate separation between cosmological signal and astrophysical/instrumental noise.\nIn this section we present a critical review of the standard procedure used to implement cosmological tests. We show that it does not account for the intrinsic uncertainties\nof cosmological observations, which may possibly lead to an under/over estimation of\nanomalies. We then present a generalization of this process which naturally accounts\nfor these uncertainties.\n\n6.1\n\nStandard Calculations\n\nSuppose x is a random variable predicted by a particular model5 and that cosmological\nobservations of this quantity returned the value x0 . We would like to calculate the\nprobability, according to this model, that in a random Universe we would have x \u2264 x0 .\nAssuming that Pth is the (normalized) probability density function (pdf) of x, this\nprobability is commonly defined to be\n\u02c6 x0\nP\u2264 \u2261\nPth (x) dx .\n(64)\n\u2212\u221e\n5\n\nRigorously, x is only one realization of a random variable X, which is a real-valued function defined\non a sample space. By the same reason we should not call the a`m 's in Eq. (3) random variables,\nthough we shall stick to this nomenclature throughout this text.\n\n35\n\n\fThe probability of having x > x0 is then simply given by P> = 1 \u2212 P\u2264 . See the figure\nbelow.\n\nx0\n\nFigure 5: Probability density function for the theoretical variable x. The shaded are is\nthe probability Eq. (64).\n\nIf P\u2264 is found to be too small or, equivalently, too high, we might be tempted\nto interpret x0 as \"anomalous\" according to this model. However, this definition of\nprobability assumes that x0 was measured with infinite precision, and so it says nothing\nabout an important question we must deal with: typically, the measurement of x0 has\nan uncertainty which needs to be folded into the final probabilities that the observations\nmatch the theoretical expectations.\nMoreover, since no two equally prepared experiments will ever return the same value\nx0 , our measurements should also be regarded as random events. In a more rigorous\napproach, we would have to consider x0 itself as one realization of a random variable,\nconditioned to the distribution of the signal. In the case of CMB, however, this would\nbe only part of the whole picture, since the randomness of the measurements of x0\nshould also be related to the way this data is reduced to its final form. This happens\nbecause different map cleaning procedures will lead to slightly different values for x0 .\nThis difference induces a variance in the data which reflects the remaining foreground\ncontamination of the temperature map. We will elaborate more on this point through\na concrete example, after we show how Eq. (64) may be changed in order to include\nthe indeterminacy of cosmological measurements.\n\n6.2\n\nConvolving probabilities\n\nThe question we want to answer is: how to calculate the probability of x being smaller\nthan our measurements when the latter are also random events? Let us suppose that\n\n36\n\n\four measurement is described by the random variable y and that x0 is its most probable\nvalue. The probability of having x \u2264 y is simply the probability of having\nz \u2261x\u2212y \u22640\nfor some particular realization of the variable y. It should be clear by now that if we\nknow the pdf of z, the probability we are looking for is simply the area under this\ndistribution for \u2212\u221e \u2264 z \u2264 0. The probability P\u2264 of z being smaller or equal to zero\ncan be calculated as:\n \u0308\nP\u2264 \u2261 P {(x, y)|x \u2212 y \u2264 0} =\nP(x, y) dx dy .\nx\u2212y \u22640\n\nNow, under the hypothesis of independence of x and y we have P(x, y) = Pth (x)Pobs (y),\nwhere Pobs is the (normalized) probability distribution function of the variable y. We\ncan therefore rewrite the last expression as\n\u0015\n\u02c6 \u221e \u0014\u02c6 y\nP\u2264 =\nPth (x) dx Pobs (y) dy .\n\u2212\u221e\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nIf we now hold y fixed and do the change of variables x = u + y, we get\n\u0015\n\u02c6 0 \u0014\u02c6 \u221e\nP\u2264 =\nPth (u + y)Pobs (y) dy du .\n\u2212\u221e\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nwhere we have changed the position of the integrals. The reader will now notice that\nterm inside brackets is precisely the pdf we were looking for. Since there is nothing\nspecial about the variable y, we can equally well hold x fixed and repeat the calculus,\nobtaining the symmetric version of this result. In fact, the final pdf for z is nothing\nelse than the convolution of the pdf's of each variable [77]:\n\u02c6 \u221e\nPobs (y)Pth (z \u00b1 y) dy\nP(z) \u2261 (Pobs \u2217 Pth ) (z) =\n\u2212\u221e\n\u02c6 \u221e\nPobs (x \u2213 z)Pth (x) dx .\n(65)\n=\n\u2212\u221e\n\nwhere the plus (minus) sign refers to the difference (sum) of x and y. Integrating this\npdf from (\u2212\u221e, 0] we get our answer\n\u02c6 0\nP\u2264 \u2261\nP(z)dz .\n(66)\n\u2212\u221e\n\nAs a consistency check, notice that in the limit where observations are made with\ninfinite precision, Pobs (y) becomes a delta function and we have:\n\u02c6 0 \u02c6 +\u221e\n\u02c6 \u00b1x0\nP\u2264 =\n\u03b4(y \u2212 x0 )Pth (z \u00b1 y)dydz =\nPth (x)dx\n\u2212\u221e\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\n37\n\n\fwhich agrees with our previous definition. The reader must be careful, though, not to\nthink of Eq. (64) as some lower bound to Eq. (66). Since none of the pdf's appearing\nin Eq. (65) are necessarily symmetric, a large distance from x0 to the most probable\n(not the mean!) value x would not, by itself, constitute sufficient grounds to claim that\nthe measured value of this observable is \"unusual\" in any sense, simply because a large\noverlap between the two pdf's can render the result usual according to Eq. (66).\nTo illustrate this point, let us calculate P\u2264 using Eq. (64) and Eq. (66) for the\npdf's which appear in Fig. 6. For pedagogical reasons, we have chosen Pth and Pobs as\npositively (Maxwell distribution) and negatively (Gumbel distribution) skewed pdf's,\nrespectively. The convolved distribution appears as the solid (black) line. For these\npdf's, Eq. (64) gives 99.2%, while Eq. (66) gives 93.6% of chance of x being smaller\nthan the observed x0 ; all pdf's were normalized to one.\n0.5\n0.4\n0.3\n0.2\n0.1\n\n-4\n\n-2\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\nFigure 6: Probability density functions for x (blue, dashed line), y (red, dot-dashed\nline) and z (solid line.)

See the text for more details.\n\n7\n\nA \u03c72 test of statistical isotropy\n\nAlthough the last example was constructed to emphasize an important feature of the\nformalism developed in \u00a76, cosmological observables designed to measure deviations\nof either gaussianity or statistical isotropy will often follow asymmetric distributions.\nThe intrinsic uncertainties of cosmological measurements, specially the ones originating\nfrom map cleaning procedures, may be crucial when searching for any map's anomalies.\nWe will now make a concrete application of this formalism using the angular-planar\nchi-square test developed in \u00a75.1\n\n38\n\n\f7.1\n\n\u039bCDM model\n\nIn the simplest realization of the \u039bCDM model, the covariance matrix of temperature\nmaps is determined by ha`1 m1 a`2 m2 i = (\u22121)m2 C`1 \u03b4`1 `2 \u03b4m1 ,\u2212m2 . Using this expression in\n(60), we find that\n(SI)\n\nC`lm = C` \u03b4l0 \u03b4m0 .\n\n(67)\n\nOn the other hand, if the only non-zero C`lm 's are given by l = m = 0, then C`00 = C` .\nTherefore, statistical isotropy is achieved if and only if the angular-planar power spectrum is of the form (67). Since we are only interested in nontrivial planar modulations,\nwe will restrict our analysis to the cases where l 6= 0, that is\nC`lm = 0 ,\n\n(l \u2265 2)\n\n(68)\n\nwhere, we remind the reader, the parity of ` comes from the symmetry (24).\nFor this particular model, we can also calculate the covariance matrix of the estimator (62) explicitly. Using the null hypothesis above, we find after some algebra\nthat\n\u0010\n\u00112\nX\nl,`\nlm \u2217 b l0 m0\n2\nb\nh(C` ) C` i = 8\u03c0\nC`1 C`2 I`1 `2 \u03b4ll0 \u03b4mm0 .\n(69)\n`1 ,`2\n\nThis matrix has some interesting properties. First, note that the planar degrees of freedom are independent in this case (which justifies the (2l +1)\u22121 ) factor introduced in Eq.\n(63).) Second, its diagonal elements are given by the variance (\u03c3`lm )2 = h(Cb`lm )\u2217 Cb`lm i,\nwhich now becomes m-independent:\n\u0010\n\u00112\nX\n\u00012\n\u00012\nC`1 C`2 I`l,`1 `2 .\n\u03c3`lm \u2192 \u03c3`l = 8\u03c0 2\n(70)\n`1 ,`2\n\nTherefore, for the particular case of the \u039bCDM model, the chi-square test (63) gets\neven simpler. Using (68) and (70), we find\n(\u03c72\u03bd )l`\n\nl\nX\n|Cb`lm |2\n1\n.\n=\n2l + 1 m=\u2212l (\u03c3`l )2\n\n(71)\n\nIt is now clear that if the data under analysis are really described by this model, then\nit must be true that\nh(\u03c72\u03bd )l` i\n\nl\nX\n1\nh(Cb`lm )\u2217 Cb`lm i\n=\n=1\n2l + 1 m=\u2212l\n(\u03c3`l )2\n\nwhere we have used (70). This shows that any large deviation of this test from unity\nwill be an indication of planar modulation in temperature maps, up, of course, to error\nbars. For convenience, let us define a new quantity as\n\u03c7`l \u2261 (\u03c72\u03bd )l` \u2212 1\n39\n\n(72)\n\n\fwhich will quantify anisotropies whenever \u03c7`l is significantly positive or negative.\nThis generalized chi-square test furnishes a complete prescription when searching\nfor planar modulations of temperature in CMB maps. We emphasize, though, that\nfor a given CMB map, the chi-square analysis must be done entirely in terms of that\nmap's data. Since we are performing a model-independent test, we are not allowed to\nintroduce fiducial biases in the analysis (for example, by calculating \u03c3`l using C`model ),\nwhich would only include our a priori prejudices about what the map's anisotropies\nshould look like. Since the C` 's are, by construction, a measure of statistical isotropy.\nConsequently, an \"anomalous\" detection of C` 's is by no means a measure of statistical\nanisotropy, and it is this particular value that should be used in (72) if we want to find\ndeviations of isotropy, regardless of how high/low it is.\n\n7.2\n\nSearching for planar signatures in WMAP\n\nIn order to apply the test (72) to the 5-year WMAP data [14, 11], we will define two\nnew variables\nx \u2261 (\u03c7\u03042 )l`(th) , y \u2261 (\u03c7\u03042 )l`(obs) ,\nwhich will be jointly analyzed using the formalism of section \u00a76. Still, there remains\nthe question of how to obtain their pdf's. These functions can be obtained numerically\nprovided that the number of realizations of each variable is large enough, since in\nthis case their histograms can be considered as piecewise constant functions which\napproximate the real pdf's. For the case of the (theoretical) variable x defined above\nwe have run 2 \u00d7 104 Monte Carlo simulations of Gaussian and statistically isotropic\nCMB maps using the \u039bCDM best-fit C` 's provided by the WMAP team [78]. With\nthese maps we have then constructed 2 \u00d7 104 realizations of the variable x.\nThe simulation of the (observational) variable y is more difficult, and depends on the\nway we estimate contamination from residual foregrounds in CMB maps. As is wellknown, not only instrumental noise, but systematic errors (e.g., in the map-making\nprocess), the inhomogeneous scanning of the sky (i.e., the exposure function of the\nprobe), or unremoved foreground emissions (even after applying a cut-sky mask) could\ncorrupt \u2013 at distinct levels \u2013 the CMB data.\nForeground contamination, on the other hand, may have several different sources,\nmany of which are far beyond our present scopes. However, since different teams apply\ndistinct procedures on the raw data in order to produce a final map, we will make the\nhypothesis that maps cleaned by different teams represent \u2013 to a good extent \u2013 \"independent\" CMB maps. Therefore, we can estimate the residual foreground contaminations\nby comparing these different foreground-cleaned maps.\nIn fact, the WMAP science team has made substantial efforts to improve the data\nproducts by minimizing the contaminating effects caused by diffuse galactic foregrounds,\nastrophysical point-sources, artifacts from the instruments and measurement process,\nand systematic errors [84, 85]. As a result, multi-frequency foreground-cleaned full-sky\nCMB maps were produced, named Internal Linear Combination maps, corresponding\n40\n\n\fFull sky maps\n\nReferences\n\nHinshaw et. al.\n\n[14, 79]\n\nde Oliveira-Costa et. al.\n\n[80]\n\nKim et. al.\n\n[81]\n\nPark et. al.\n\n[82]\n\nDelabrouille et. al.\n\n[83]\n\nTable 1: Full-sky foreground cleaned CMB maps from WMAP data used in our analysis\nto estimate the variable y (see the text for more details.) Note that the reference [81]\nincludes the analysis of maps from the three and five years WMAP releases.\nto three and five year WMAP data [14, 79]. To account for the mentioned randomness,\nsystematic, and contaminating effects of the CMB data, we will use in our analyses\nseveral full-sky foreground-cleaned CMB maps, listed in Table 1, which were produced\nusing both the three and five year WMAP data.\nThe prescription we adopt to determine the distribution of the observational variable\ny is as follows: we simulate Gaussian random a`m 's in such a way that their central values\nare given by the five year ILC5 data [79, 14], and with a variance which is estimated\nfrom the sample standard deviation of all the maps listed in Table 1. So, for example,\nsuppose we have n different full-sky temperature maps at hand and we want to estimate\nthe randomness inherent in the determination of, let's say, a32 . Therefore, we take\nN (aILC5\n32 , \u03c332 ) \u2192 a32 ,\nwith\n\u03c332\n\nv\nu\nu\n=t\n\n(73)\n\nn\n\n1 X i\n(a \u2212 \u010132 )2\nn \u2212 1 i=1 32\n\nn\n\nand\n\n\u010132\n\n1X i\n=\na ,\nn i=1 32\n\n(74)\n\nwhere N (\u03bc, \u03c3) represents a Gaussian distribution with mean \u03bc and standard deviation\n\u03c3. Note that if the residual contamination is indeed weak, then the sample variance\nabove will be small, and our procedure will reduce to the standard way of calculating\nprobabilities. As for the use of a Gaussian in (73), this choice was dictated not only\nby simplicity, but rather by the fact that the propagation of uncertainties in physical\nexperiments are usually assumed to follow a normal distribution. Note however that\nthere are some instrumental uncertainties, such as beam or gain uncertainties, which\nwill not in general follow normal distributions. In fact, some of them may even fail to\nbe additive, meaning that our convolution formula will be inapplicable in these cases.\nIn our analysis, we have focused only on foreground residuals, where the normality\nhypothesis is reasonable6 .\n6\n\nWe thank the referee for pointing out this important aspect of the formalism.\n\n41\n\n\fl\\`\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n2\n\n81.1%\n\n73.7%\n\n54.1%\n\n6.1%\n\n80.7%\n\n46.4%\n\n36.9%\n\n47.5%\n\n81.8%\n\n4\n\n74.0%\n\n72.6%\n\n55.0%\n\n39.6%\n\n74.2% 93.2%\n\n51.6%\n\n55.4%\n\n56.3%\n\n6\n\n78.1%\n\n80.7%\n\n69.3%\n\n52.3%\n\n33.6%\n\n80.0%\n\n95.0%\n\n50.3%\n\n82.2%\n\n8\n\n63.5%\n\n87.7%\n\n18.8%\n\n51.5%\n\n21.4%\n\n66.4%\n\n31.6%\n\n27.5%\n\n82.3%\n\n10\n\n67.9%\n\n50.0% 61.0%\n\n8.7%\n\n37.7%\n\n59.5%\n\n36.6%\n\n29.2%\n\n35.7%\n\nTable 3: Final probabilities of obtaining, in a random \u039bCDM Universe, a chi-square\nvalue smaller or equal to (\u03c7\u03042 )l`(obs) , as given by full-sky temperature maps.\n\n7.3\n\nFull-sky maps\n\nFollowing this procedure, we have used the full-sky maps shown in Table (1) to construct 104 Gaussian random a`m 's, which were then used to calculate 104 realizations\nof y = (\u03c7\u03042 )l`(obs) .

We show only a few representative figures. The\nfinal probabilities are shown in Table 3 and correspond to the area under the solid curve\nfrom \u2212\u221e to 0. All pdf's are normalized to 1.\n\nOverall, our results show no significant planar deviations of anisotropy in WMAP\ndata. The most unlikely individual values in Table (3) are in the sectors (l, `) given by\n(2, 5), (10, 5), (4, 7) and (6, 8), and are all above a relative chance of 5% of either being\ntoo negative [(2, 5), (10, 5)] or too positive [(4, 7), (6, 8)]. However, it is perhaps worth\nmentioning that not only the individual values of (\u03c7\u03042 )l` are relevant, their coherence\nover a range of angular or planar momenta also carries interesting information. So, for\nexample, a set of (\u03c7\u03042 )l` 's which are all individually within the cosmic variance bounds,\nbut which are all positive (or negative) can be an indication of an excess (or lack)\nof planar modulation. This type of coherent behavior appears in the following cases:\n(\u03c7\u03042 )l2 , (\u03c7\u03042 )l3 and, to a lesser extent, (\u03c7\u03042 )4` \u2013 see Table 3. The angular quadrupole ` = 2,\nas well as the angular octupole ` = 3, have all positive planar spectra (for all values\nof l which we were able to compute), indicated by probabilities larger than 50%. The\nplanar hexadecupole l = 4 also has 8 out of 9 angular spectra assuming positive values\n43\n\n\f(only ` = 5 is negative).\nThe data analyzed in this Section relates to the full-sky maps, which are certainly\nstill affected by residual galactic foregrounds. The reader interested in the complete\nanalysis, including data from masked CMB maps, can check reference [28].\n\n44\n\n\f8\n\nConclusions\n\nWe know our Universe is not perfectly Gaussian, or homogeneous, or isotropic. The\ndeviations from an idealized picture (or the lack thereof), whether predictably small or\nsurprisingly large, can tell us a great deal about the Universe we live in. Since the types\nof physical mechanisms behind deviations from perfect gaussianity, homogeneity or\nisotropy are typically very different, we should try to measure these individual features\nseparately \u2013 whenever possible or practical.\nRecently it has been suggested that some of the most discussed anomalies in the\nCMB can be explained away [86], or that the evidence for them is statistically weak\n[87]. But even if it turns out that our Universe is a plain vanilla kind of place, where\neverything goes according to the inflationary theorist's dreams, we would still need to\nanalyze it with tools that allow us to check the standard picture against the data. In\naddition, local physics (related to the solar system, or our galaxy), as well as instrumental quirks, tend to leave imprints on the CMB which are clearly anisotropic, but\nhave a certain coherence which can be detected, and possibly corrected for, with the\nhelp of these checks.\nHowever, in an era where at least the large-scale maps of the CMB are likely to\nremain basically unchanged, we should be careful not to over analize the data with the\nbenefit of an ever greater hindsight (put another way, a posteriori conundrums only get\nworse with time.) This can only be achieved if we find natural and generally agreed-upon\nclassifications of the types of deviations that may occur, without too much guidance\nfrom what the data is telling us. We believe that focusing on the possible underlying\nsymmetries, with perhaps some guidance from group-theoretic arguments, is one way\nto settle these issues. We have presented a few methods along these lines, one using\nmultipole vectors, the other using a natural generalization of the two-point correlation\nfunction \u2013 and other methods have been presented in this Review.\nPerhaps the best indication that we are on the right track is the fact that most of\nthese methods are applicable in other areas of physics and astronomy \u2013 and that in\nsome cases we have adapted tests of anisotropy from other areas, such as scattering\ntheory and the theory of angular momentum in quantum mechanics. So, even if these\nanomalies eventually perish, they will be survived by the powerful methods that have\nbeen devised to test them.\n\nAcknowledgements\nWe would like to thank Glenn Starkman and Yuri Shtanov for enlightening discussions\nduring the development of this work.

After integrating it out, we rotate our coordinate system using\nthree Euler angles to recover back the (\u0398, \u03a6) dependence, which can then be integrated\nwith the help of some Wigner matrices identities. We start by positioning the vectors\nn\u03021 and n\u03022 in the xy plane, i.e, we chose n\u03021 = (\u03c0/2, \u03c61 ), n\u03022 = (\u03c0/2, \u03c62 ). By (59) we then\nhave cos \u03b8 = cos(\u03c61 \u2212 \u03c62 ). Using the relation [41]\nq\n(\n`+m\n2`+1 (`+m\u22121)!!

This gives us\nX X\n1 X lm\n\u221a\nha`1 m1 a\u2217`2 m2 iI``1 m1 `2 m2\nC` Ylm (0, 0) =\n\u03c0 l,m\n` ,m ` ,m\n1\n\n1 2\n\n(77)\n\n2\n\nwhere we have introduced the following definition\n\u02c6 \u03c0\n`\nP` (cos(\u03c61 \u2212 \u03c62 ))ei(m1 \u03c61 \u2212m2 \u03c62 ) d(cos(\u03c61 \u2212 \u03c62 )) .\nI`1 m1 `2 m2 \u2261 \u2212\u03bb`1 m1 \u03bb`2 m2\n\n(78)\n\n0\n\nWe need now to integrate out the \u0398 and \u03a6 dependence in the right-hand side of\n(77) which was hidden due to our choice of a particular coordinate system. In order\nto do that, we keep the vectors n\u03021 and n\u03022 fixed and make a rotation of our coordinate\nsystem using three Euler angles \u03c9 = {\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3}. This rotation changes the coefficients\nC`lm 's and a`m 's according to\nX\nX\n`\nl\nelm0\na`m =\nDmm\na`m0 ,\nC`lm =\nDmm\n0 (\u03c9)e\n0 (\u03c9)C`\nm0\n\nm0\n\nalm are the multipolar coefficients in the new coordinate system and\nwhere Ce`lm and e\nl\nwhere Dmm\n(\u03c9)\nare the elements of the Wigner rotation matrix. The advantage of\n0\npositioning the vectors n\u03021 and n\u03022 in the plane xy is that now the angles \u0398 and \u03a6 are\ngiven precisely by the Euler angles \u03b2 and \u03b3, regardless of the value of \u03b1\n!\nX\nX\nX\nX\n0\n0\nCelm\nDl 0 (\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3)Ylm (0, 0) =\nCelm Yl,\u2212m (\u03b2, \u03b3)\nC lm Ylm (0, 0) =\n`\n\n`\n\nl,m\n\nmm\n\nl,m0\n\n`\n\nl,m0\n\nm\n\np\nwhere in the last step we have used Ylm (0, 0) = (2l + 1)/4\u03c0 \u03b4m0 .
