These models\ndescribe continuous distributions of non-intersecting membranes (strings). Each\nspace-time point belongs to world surface of one membrane, i.e. foliation of spacetime is specified (to describe membrane fluid one has to specify foliation and density\nof membrane matter).\nString fluid models are applicable in various realms of physics and cosmology.\nE.g. one can apply zero-brane fluid to describe dark energy (on dark energy see\ne.g. [1] and references wherein). Other applications are related to string theory and\nrelativistic elasticity theory.\nThere are two different approaches to string fluids, which have different field\ncontents. These approaches are not equivalent.\nBoth methods describes fluid of (n \u2212 1)-dimensional membranes (with ndimensional world surfaces V\u03c6 ) in D-dimensional space-time M by means of (D\u2212n)form J (membrane field intensity), which is Hodge dual of n-form current density\nj = \u2217\u22121 J.\nTo specify foliation one need form J up to non-zero scalar factor.\nThe action, written in terms of J has the similar form for both methods\nS=\n\nZ\n\n\u2217L0 (kJk),\n\nM\n\u2217\n\ne-mail:\n\nmgi@mi.ras.ru\n\n1\n\n(1)\n\n\fwhere\nkJk =\n\ns\n\n1\nJM ...M\nJ M1 ...MD\u2212n ,\n(D \u2212 n)! 1 D\u2212n\n\n(2)\n\nkJk represents density of membrane media in space-time M. Lagrangian L0 is\nminus energy density in attendant frame. (We use (\u2212, +, +, . . . , +) signature of\nspace-time metric.)\nEquation of state is described by relation\nPfluid = L0 \u2212 L\u20320 kJk.\n\n(3)\n\nHere Pfluid is pressure in directions orthogonal to membrane world surface.\nEnergy-momentum tensor has the following form\nTM N = L0 PM N + Pfluid P\u0304M N .\n\n(4)\n\nPM N is projector to world surface V\u03c6 (surface \u03c6 = const), P\u0304M N = gM N \u2212 PM N is\nprojector to directions orthogonal to world surface.\nDue to conservation of membrane current J is closed\n\u03b4j = 0,\n\n\u21d4\n\ndJ = 0.\n\n(5)\n\nForm J has to satisfy the following condition (orthogonality to membrane world\nsurface V\u03c6 )\n\u2200 A \u2208 T V\u03c6 .\n(6)\nJM1 M2 ...MD\u2212n AM1 = 0,\nTwo methods differ by parametrization of J in terms of dynamical field.\nThe form J is closed, so the most obvious way is to consider membrane field in\nterms of (n \u2212 1)-form potential I (similar to non-linear electrodynamics)\nJI = dI.\n\n(7)\n\nIn this approach the action has the following form\nSI [I] =\n\nZ\n\n\u2217L0 (kJI k),\n\n(8)\n\nM\n\nThis method was introduced independently by several authors, see e.g. [2, 3, 4] and\nreferences wherein. Conservation condition (5) is satisfied automatically. To satisfy\ncondition (6) one has to restrict himself by certain class of solutions (it can be done\nby introduction of additional term to action, which impose appropriate constraint).\nThese solutions are generalizations of potential flow in standard hydrodynamics.\nPotential I could be considered as membrane field intensity for Dirac membrane\n(string) fluid (see section 6).\nAnother way was initially suggested (in the particular case of constant volume\nform \u03a9F ) to describe single membranes [5]\u2013[12] (papers [11, 12] suggest dual interpretation, which correspond to use of \u2217J form instead of J). It was later geometrized\nand generalized to membrane fluids and other continuous media in [13]\u2013[18]. Using\nthis method one has to consider auxiliary (D\u2212n)-dimensional space F (points \u03c6 \u2208 F\nnumerate membranes V\u03c6 ) with volume form, which represents density of membrane\nmedia in auxiliary space F,\n\u03a9F = f (\u03c6) d\u03c61 \u2227 . . . \u2227 d\u03c6D\u2212n ,\n\n2\n\n(9)\n\n\fwhere \u03c6\u03b1 , \u03b1 = 1, . . . , D \u2212 n are coordinates at F, and mapping\n\u03c6 : M \u2192 F,\n\n(10)\n\n\u03b1\n\n\u03c6(X) = (\u03c6 (X)).\nMembrane field intensity is defined by the following relation\nJ\u03c6 = \u03c6\u2217 \u03a9F = f (\u03c6) d\u03c61 \u2227 . . . \u2227 d\u03c6D\u2212n .\n\n(11)\n\nIn this approach the action has the following form\nS\u03c6 [\u03c6] =\n\nZ\n\n\u2217L0 (kJ\u03c6 k).\n\n(12)\n\nM\n\nConservation condition (5) is satisfied automatically. Moreover, condition (6) is\nalso satisfied automatically. Every solution of model (8), which satisfies condition\n(6), is also solution (potential flow) of model (12). Field equations of model (8)\nare field equations of model (12) with extra condition of flow potentiality. These\n\u2032 \u2217J\n0\npotential flows admit also dual description with J replaced by \u2217K = \u2217 \u2202L\n\u2202J = L0 kJk .\nThe theory written in terms of fields \u03c6 has no linear dependence in equations of\nmotion. So, the theory admits straightforward Hamiltonian formulation and formal\nquantization [14]. The other approach to quantize the theory is based upon the\nNambu brackets (see [19] and references wherein).\nHere we present a method, which involves both \u03c6 and I.

To guarantee the possibility to find such\nsurface one could require electric currents to be singular (like point particles) too.\nDirac \"string\" world surface is uniquely defined by (q + 1)-form I, so actually\nwe do not need Dirac \"string\" itself, but form I (Dirac \"string\" density) only. This\npoint of view is more flexible, one has no longer obligation to restrict himself by\nfields I of form (52). It reveal more general symmetry like (38).\nForm JI = dI is membrane field intensity. It satisfies conditions (5) and (6).\nForm I is not unique. It is defined up to gradient transformation (38). By\nappropriate choice of gauge form I could satisfy condition (6) (with V\u03c6 replaced\nby world surface I of Dirac membrane), but not (5). So form I is similar to nonconserved membrane field intensity. It describes Dirac membrane fluid. It is natural\nto replace condition (6), for field I, which holds only in special gauge by more subtle\ncondition\ndI M1 M2 ...MD\u2212n AM1 = 0,\n\u2200 A \u2208 T V\u03c6 .\n(54)\n\n7\n7.1\n\nConclusion\nModels variety\n\nThe approach proposed here is applicable not only to introduce interaction between\nmembrane fluid and electrodynamics-type field. Instead of membrane fluid one can\nuse membrane elastic media (see [18]), which also involve membrane density form\nJ\u03c6 . E.g. one could construct different classical models of elastic electrons.\nThe form of action of electrodynamics-type field is not fixed too. The method\nis also applicable for nonlinear models like Born-Infeld-type models, etc.\nEven membrane fluid models are able to reproduce wide range of state equations.\nState equation p(\u03c1) is related with Lagrangian L0 (kJk) = \u2212\u03c1(kJk) by the following\nrelation:\nZ\nd\u03c1\n.\n(55)\nln kJk =\n\u03c1 + p(\u03c1)\n\n8\n\n\fE.g. state equation\np = w\u03c1\nis reproduced by action\nSw [\u03c6] = \u2212\n\nZ\n\n\u2217kJ\u03c6 k1+w ,\n\nor\n\nSw [\u03c6, I, K] =\n\nM\n\nZ \u001a\n\n(56)\n\n\u2217(JI , J\u03c6 )\n\nM\n\n1+w\n2\n\n\u001b\n\n1\n+ (J\u03c6 \u2212 JI ) \u2227 \u2217K .\n2\n\n(57)\n\u03c1 = \u2212L0 = kJ\u03c6 k1+w , see equations (3), (4).\nZero-brane fluid with negative pressure \u22121.5 < w < \u22120.5 could be useful to\ndescribe dark energy [1].\n\n7.2\n\nNo-classical monopole hypothesis\n\nThe approach described has an unexpected heuristic issue. One can conclude that\nsimultaneous existence of electric and magnetic currents is not possible. The electrictype sources considered in section 4 automatically suggests non-existence of magnetic type source (as consequence of field equations). Similarly, the magnetic-type\nsources considered in section 5 automatically suggests non-existence of electric type\nsource (as consequence of field equations).\nThis difficulties have simple physical interpretation. The Dirac string approach\nrequire the possibility to draw Dirac string through the regions with no electric\ncharges. If charges are point-like, then one able to draw Dirac strings in any situation. This requirement is crucial, because Dirac strings are similar to magnetic flux\ntubes. If a point electric charge intersect Dirac string it has to suffer infinitely large\nimpact of Lorentzian force. Fortunately in classical theory with point particles the\nprobability of this process is zero.\nNevertheless the classical theory with point particle is not self-consistent. If\none replace point electric charges by continuous distributions, then there are configurations of charges, which make impossible to draw Dirac strings. Similarly, if\nmagnetic charges are delocalized, then instead of single Dirac strings one has Dirac\nstring distribution, which occupies finite volume.\nIn quantum theory one could expect delocalization of classical singular charges\ndue to uncertainty principle. So, infinite impact with infinitesimal probability could\nproduce the finite effect of interaction of electrical charges with Dirac strings.\nThe arguments above suggests the hypothesis, that there is no self-consistent\nclassical theory with action, which involves both electric charges and magnetic\nmonopoles.\n\nAcknowledgement\nThe author is grateful to I.V.
