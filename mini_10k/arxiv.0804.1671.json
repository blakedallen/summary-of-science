Furthermore, the existence of additional\nmetastable solid phases at relatively low pressure, the\nso-called carbynes, is still hotly debated [1, 2]). In addition to the bulk phases, there are the more recently\ndiscovered fullerenes, C60 and C70 [3], nanotubes [4],\nand graphene [5].\nThe reason why a simple element such as carbon can\nmanifest itself in so many different forms is related to\nits unusual chemical properties: carbon exhibits three\ndifferent possibilities for covalent bond formation: sp3\nhybridization appears in diamond, sp2 hybridization is\nfound in graphite, graphene, nanotubes, and fullerenes,\nwhilst in carbynes, C should exhibit sp hybridization.\nBecause of their high cohesive energies and concomitant high activation energies that must be overcome in\nstructural phase transformations, carbon polymorphs\noften exist in metastable form well inside pressuretemperature regions where another solid form is thermodynamically stable. For example, it is well known\nthat diamonds survive at normal P-T conditions, where\ngraphite is the thermodynamically stable phase. Conversely, graphite tends to persist at very high pressures,\ndeep into the diamond stability region of the phase diagram.\nIt is also interesting that, at zero pressure and temperature, graphite and diamond have a very similar\n(and quite large) binding energy per atom, i.e. 7.37\neV (graphite) vs 7.35 eV (diamond).

Local properties that may change in\na LLPT are the local coordination or hybridization,\ntypical global properties that are affected are the density or the resistivity. LLPT's in dense, atomic liquids are typically difficult to probe experimentally: the\ncandidate transitions often occur at extreme pressures\nand/or temperatures or appear in metastable regions of\nthe phase diagram (and may be hidden by competing\nsolidification). Evidence for LLPT's have been found\nfor a number of atomic systems, such as Cs [6], As [7],\nBi [8], Ge [9], Hg [10], S [11], Sb [12], Se [13], Si [14, 15],\nSn [16], H2 [17], I2 [18], N2 [19, 20]. The best established experimental example of a LLPT in an atomic\nliquid is the case of phosphorus. A transition between\na fluid of tetrahedral P4 molecules and a network forming (and metallic) liquid was predicted on theoretical\ngrounds [21, 22], and subsequently verified experimentally [23, 24]. The LLPT in phosphorus has been analysed in several numerical studies [25, 26, 27, 28]. Many\nother network-forming liquids are also expected to exhibit LLPT'a: first and foremost water [29, 30], but\nalso SiO2 [31] and GeO2 [32]. Although considerable\nprogress has been made in the theoretical description\nof LLPT's [33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38], a unified theoretical\npicture is still lacking.\nIn this review we discuss the phase diagram of solid\nand liquid carbon at high pressures and temperatures\non the basis of the results of numerical simulations;\nboth quantum and classical. We present evidence that\nthe presence of graphite-like and diamond-like local\nstructures in the liquid does not give rise to liquidliquid demixing but that the predominant local structure in the liquid varies strongly with pressure. The\nfact that the liquid is locally either graphite-like or\ndiamond-like has dramatic consequences for the nucleation of the diamond phase, a finding that may have\nsome consequences for our understanding of carbonrich planets or stars. Wherever possible, we discuss\nour own results in the context of the relevant literature about the carbon phase diagram, about a possible\nLLPT in this system and about the possibility of diamond formation in planetary interiors.\nIn section 2 we give an overview of the bond-order\npotential (\"LCBOP\") that was used to compute both\nthe equilibrium phase diagram of carbon and the path-\n\nway for diamond nucleation in liquid carbon. We also\ndiscuss in some detail the different variants of the\nLCBOP potential [39, 40] and explain the rationale\nbehind the choice of the present LCBOP potential.\nIn section 3 we briefly summarize some of the earlier\nideas about the phase diagram of carbon (in particular,\nabout the crystalline phases and the liquid). We pay\nspecial attention to the slope of the diamond melting\ncurve and the (possible) heating-rate dependence of the\ngraphite melting curve.\nIn section 3.2 we report our results concerning the\nphase diagram, in the context of recent first-principle\nsimulations and experiments.\nIn section 4.1 we review the arguments that have\nbeen put forward to support the idea that liquid carbon\ncan undergo a LLPT. We argue that, to the extent\nthat we can trust the present models of liquid carbon,\na LLPT in carbon is not be expected.\nIn section 5 we discuss our numerical results concerning the (homogeneous) nucleation of diamond from the\nbulk liquid. In particular, we discuss in some detail the\nnumerical approach that was used in Ref. [41]. In addition, we focus on the structural analysis of the small\nsolid clusters in the liquid and we discuss the implications of our findings for the formation of diamonds\nin carbon-rich star systems and the interior of giant\nplanets.\n\n2\n\nThe LCBOP-family\n\nWhilst the crystalline phases of carbon can be simulated by traditional force fields that do not allow coordination changes, a study of the liquid phase and, a\nfortiori, of phase transformations between phases with\ndifferent local coordination, requires a potential that\ncan describe carbon in different coordination states.\nThe LCBOP potential was designed with this objective in mind. LCBOP stands for \"Long range Carbon Bond Order Potential\", and represents a bondorder potential for pure carbon that includes longrange (LR) dispersive and repulsive interactions [39]\nfrom the outset. We stress that LCBOP is not based\non an existing short-range (SR) bond-order potential\nto which LR interactions have been added a posteriori,\nalthough such an approach has been proposed in the\nliterature [42, 43, 44]. The latter approach requires a\nrather special procedure to avoid interference with the\nSR potential and suffers from a loss of accuracy. In the\nLCBOP these problems are circumvented in a natural\nway.\nWe note that the term \"long range\" may be confusing in this case, as the cut-off of the LR potential in\nLCBOP is only 6 \u00c5. Usually, the term \"long range\" is\n2\n\n\fonly used for interactions with a much longer range,\nsuch as Coulomb interactions. Here we use it as a\nsynonym for \"non\u2013bonded\", referring to a range much\nlarger than the typical distances between chemically\nbonded atoms.\nAfter the introduction of LCBOP in Ref. [39], a\nnumber of significant modifications have been introduced in order to improve its description of all carbon\nphases, including liquid carbon. To facilitate the distinction between the different LCBOP potentials, the\nvarious versions have been named LCBOPI, LCBOPI+\nand LCBOPII. LCBOPI, introduced as LCBOP in Ref.\n[39], does not include torsion interactions. As torsion interactions were shown to play an important role\nin liquid carbon [45], we introduced a refinement of\nLCBOPI, called LCBOPI+, when we performed our\nfirst study of liquid carbon [46]. LCBOPI+ , includes,\namong other changes, conjugation dependent torsional\ninteractions. Clearly, describing the liquid phase requires a robust form of the potential in order to deal\nwith configurations that are quite unlike the regular\ntopologies in crystal lattices. LCBOPII addresses this\nproblem: it includes several important improvements\nover LCBOPI+ . An important innovation in LCBOPII\nis the addition of so-called middle range (MR) interactions, introduced to bridge the gap between the extent\nof the tail of the covalent interactions as found in abinitio calculations, (up to 4.5 \u00c5 in certain cases) and\nthe rather short cut-off of only 2.2 \u00c5 in LCBOPI+ for\nthese interactions.\nIn the remainder of this section we give a brief stepby-step description of the transition from bond-order\npotentials (BOPs) to LCBOPI+ . All the results presented in later sections, concerning the phase diagram,\nthe liquid structure, and the nucleation issues are obtained with this version of the potential. In Appendix\nA we discuss the LCBOPII potential, with a short account of results obtained with this refined version of\nthe potential. We aim at giving the flavour of the potentials in a mainly descriptive way with graphical illustrations, minimizing mathematical formulation.\n\nevident that each of these bonds is weaker than a bond\nin the diamond or graphite lattice with coordinations\n4 and 3 respectively. On the other hand, the number\nof bonds is larger for the simple cubic lattice. So there\nis a balance to be made, which in the case of carbon\nhas the result that graphite is the most stable phase at\nambient pressure.\nA thorough analysis of these bonding properties,\nbased on a quantum mechanical description, has been\ngiven by Anderson [47, 48, 49] and Abell [50]. In their\ndescription, that forms the basis of the tight binding\nmodels, the electronic wave function is approximated\nas a sum of localized atomic orbitals. Abell showed\nthat for a regular lattice, i.e. with an identical environment for each atom, and within the assumption that\nthe overlap integral for orbitals on different atoms is\nnon-vanishing only for nearest neighbours, the binding\nenergy per atom is given by:\nEb =\n\n1\nZ(qVR (r) + bVA (r))\n2\n\nwhere Z is the number of nearest neighbours, q is the\nnumber of valence electrons per atom, VR (r) is a twobody potential describing the core repulsion, VA (r) is\na two-body attractive potential, and b is the so-called\nbond order, a many-body term dependent on the local environment of the atoms. Abell also showed that\nthe coordination dependence of b is fairly well approximated by:\nb = b(q, Z) = \u03b1(q)Z \u22121/2\n\n(2)\n\nwith \u03b1(q) a function of q, specified in Ref. [50]. Assuming exponential functions VR (r) = A exp(\u2212\u03b8r) and\nVA (r) = \u2212B exp(\u2212\u03bbr), with A, B, \u03bb, and \u03b8 fitting\nparameters, as a reasonable approximation for overlapping atomic orbitals from atoms at distance r, and\ndefining S = \u03b8/\u03bb, some algebra leads to a total binding\nenergy given by:\nEb\n\n=\n\nS\u22121\nB\u03b1(q)\n2S\n\n=\n\nCZ 2(S\u22121)\n\nS\u22122\n\n2.1\n\n(1)\n\nBond-order potentials\n\n\u0012\n\nB\u03b1(q)\nqAS\n\n1\n\u0013 S\u22121\n\nS\u22122\n\nZ 2(S\u22121)\n(3)\n\nand an equilibrium nearest neighbour distance given\nby:\n\u221a !\n1\nqAS Z\n1\n=\nln\nlnZ + C \u2032 (4)\nreq =\n\u03b8\u2212\u03bb\nB\u03b1(q)\n2(\u03b8 \u2212 \u03bb)\n\nA bond-order potential (BOP) is a reactive potential,\ni.e. able to deal with variable coordination. It provides\na quantitative description of the simple idea that the\nbonds of an atom with many neighbours are weaker\nthan those of an atom with few neighbours, as the cohesive ability of the available electrons has to be shared\namong the neighbours. For carbon, each atom delivers\nfour valence electrons. If these four electrons have to\nmake the six bonds in a simple cubic lattice, then it is\n\nwhere C and C \u2032 are constants. Eq. 3 implies that for\nS > 2 high coordination structures (close packing) are\nfavoured (metals), whereas for S < 2 the dimer will\n3\n\n\fbe the most stable structure (extreme case of covalent\nbonding). As, in general, the repulsion falls off (much)\nfaster than the attraction, i.e. \u03b8 > \u03bb (S > 1), Eq. 4\nimplies that req is monotonically increasing with coordination. Combining Eqs. 3 and 4 yields a simple relation between Eb and req , namely Eb \u221d exp (\u03b8 \u2212 2\u03bb)req .\nIn principle BOPs are based on the above bonding\nideas. However, the transferability to different types\nof structures and materials has been greatly enhanced\nby a quite reasonable extension in the functional form\nof the bond order b. The simplest bond order bij for a\nbond ij according to a BOP in the style of Tersoff [51]\nand Brenner [52] reads:\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\u01eb\nX\nbij = \u03b1 \uf8ed1 +\nG(\u03b8ijk )\uf8f8\n(5)\n\nvalue 4 of carbon. The character of a certain bond ij,\nand its conjugation number Nijconj , a number between\n0 and 1 quantifying effects beyond nearest neighbours,\nis determined by the sum of the electrons supplied by\natom i and atom j. The interpolation model is further\nillustrated in Fig. 2.\n\n2.3\n\nThe potential LCBOPI+ is given by LCBOPI supplemented with torsion interactions and a correction of\nthe angle dependent part of the bond order for configurations involving low coordinations and small angles. Similar modifications were also included in the\nREBO potential [53], although the torsion term contains a significant difference. For LCBOPI+ , following\nthe results of ab-initio calculations, the shape of the\ntorsion energy curve as a function of the torsion angle\ndepends on conjugation, whereas for the REBO potential the curves for a double and a graphitic bond are\nequally shaped but scaled (see top panel of Fig. 20).\nDetails on LCBOPI+ are given in the appendix A of\nRef. [54] and in Ref.

Taking a constant G(\u03b8ijk ) = 1\nand \u01eb = \u22121/2 yields b = \u03b1Z \u22121/2 , i.e. one recovers\nthe functional form Abell found for b (Eq. 2).

A correct description of these interactions\nrequires a LR potential, V lr (r) that is repulsive in\nthe distance range corresponding to the second nearest\nneighbours (in diamond and graphite). In the LCBOPfamily, to get the right equilibrium lattice parameter,\nthis extra repulsion has been compensated by a somewhat stronger attractive part of the covalent interaction, achieved by an appropriate parametrisation of the\nSR potential. This is schematically illustrated in Fig.\n1.\nAnother feature of LCBOPI is that it contains a reasonable, physically motivated interpolation scheme for\nthe conjugation term to account for a mixed saturated\nand unsaturated environment. In this approach each\natom supplies a number of electrons to each of its bonds\nwith neighbouring atoms according to a certain distribution rule, the total sum being equal to the valence\n\nk1\nfil\n\nl1\n\n2\n\nfil\n\ni\nfil\nk2\n\n1\n\n\u2206 fij\n\u2206fji\n\nfjk 2\nfjk\n\nj\nfjk\n\n1\n\nl2\n\nFigure 1: Schematic representation of the LCBOP approach to the inclusion of LR interactions.

The same holds\nfor atom j.

Bakhuis Roozeboom [56], who estimated the\nphase behavior of carbon on the basis of thermodynamic arguments. Of the two solid phases, diamond\nwas recognized to have a slightly greater vapor pressure at a given temperature. The temperature of the\ngraphite/liquid/vapor triple was believed to be around\n3000 K. In 1909 Tamman [57] postulated the existence\nof a region where graphite and diamond are in pseudoequilibrium. The existence of this pseudo-equilibrium\nregion was at the basis of the method of synthesizing\ndiamond starting from carbon saturated solutions of\nmolten iron, silver, or silicates. In 1938, Rossini and\nJessup [58] of the U.S. Bureau of Standards used accurate thermodynamic data to estimate that at 0 K\nthe lowest pressure at which diamond would be stable against graphite is around 1.3 GPa, and around\n2 GPa at 500 K. In 1939, the Russian scientist Leipunskii [59] published a review of the problem of diamond\nsynthesis. On the basis of thermodynamic data, he\nsuggested that the melting curve of graphite might be\nat about 4000 K, with possibly some increase with\npressure. This value for the melting of graphite was\nrather well verified the same year by Basset [60], who\nestablished the graphite/liquid/vapor triple point to be\nat about 11 MPa and 4000 K. In that same publication, Basset reported on a rather pressure independent\nmelting temperature of graphite at \u223c 4000 K, from\natmospheric pressure up to 0.1 GPa. In 1947 Bridgman [61] addressed the problem of extrapolating the\ngraphite/diamond coexistence curve beyond the region\nwhere it can be estimated from known physical properties (4 GPa/1200 K). He concluded that there was\na possibility that at higher temperatures the rate of\nincrease of P with T along the curve would decrease.\nThis hypothesis was later supported by Liljeblad [62]\nin 1955, while Berman and Simon [63] in the same\nyear came to the conclusion that the best extrapolation\nwould be a straight line. Experiments that could decide\nthis issue were started by Bundy and coworkers in 1954,\nwhen they accomplished diamond synthesis by activating the graphite-to-diamond reaction with the use of\ndifferent solvent-catalyst metals. The relevant experimental data were published only much later [64, 65],\nand are compatible with the Berman-Simon straight\nline extrapolation.\nBundy and his group made also extensive experiments\non graphite melting at pressures much higher than the\ngraphite/liquid/vapor triple point.

A historical approach may give a better understanding why certain issues have been, and\nin some case still are, controversial. After setting the\nstage (with a particular attention to the ideas about\nthe sign of the slope of the diamond melting curve and\nthe long debated issue of the position and nature of the\ngraphite melting curve), we focus on the topic of the\nLLPT for carbon.\n5\n\n\fof the graphite melting curve is an experimental challenge for several reasons. First of all, to reach pressures\nas high as 10 GPa, the sample must be in direct contact with a solid container and, because the melting\ntemperature are so high, this container must be made\nof a material that is as refractory and inert as possible\n(Bundy chose boron nitride, pyrophyllite, MgO and diamond powder). In addition, both the heating of the\nsample and the observations of the high-pressure/hightemperature phase must be carried out very rapidly,\nbefore the wall material can melt or react with the\ncarbon sample. The experiments were performed by\ndischarging an electrical capacitor through the sample\n(this procedure is known as flash heating), and by monitoring the current through, and the voltage across it\nby means of a two-beam oscilloscope. The discharge\ncircuit was designed to have energy insertion in the\nsample within a few milliseconds. The interpretation\nof such experiments, is rather sensitive to the assumed\npressure and temperature dependence of the material\nunder study and on the assumption that the pressure\nof the graphite specimen during rapid heating is the\nsame as in a quasi-static process. With these assumptions, Bundy' s experiments gave a graphite melting\ncurve as shown in Fig. 3. A maximum melting temperature of about 4600 K was detected in the region of\n6 GPa to 7 GPa. The presence of a region with a negative dT /dP along the melting curve indicates that, at\nthose pressures, the density of the liquid at the melting\ntemperature is greater than that of the solid.\nInterrupting for a moment the historical order of\nevents, we note that, throughout the past century, different experiments located the graphite melting curve\nat rather different temperatures [66, 60, 67, 68, 65, 69,\n70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75]. At low pressure, the melting\ntemperature (Tm ) was found at values ranging from\n\u223c 3800 to \u223c 5000 K. Asinovskii et al. [76] pointed out\nthe non negligible dependence of graphite Tm on the\nheating rate of the sample. Specifically, heating times\nof the order of 10\u22125 s [70, 72] yielded estimates of\nTm \u223c 4800 \u2212 5000 K; heating times of the order of\n10\u22123 s [71, 74] suggested Tm \u223c 4500 \u2212 4600 K; finally\nexperiments with heating times of the order of one second [60, 69] were consistent with the assumption that\nTm \u223c 3800\u22124000 K. In ref [76], after a thorough discussion of the experimental methods, the authors recommended that only data coming from experiments with\nheating time of the order of seconds or more should\nbe accepted. This implied that most of the available\ndata on graphite melting had to be reconsidered and\nthat the question of the position and the shape of the\nmelting curve is still open. On the basis of a series of\nlaser induced slow heating experiments [76] (i.e. heat-\n\ning times of the order of one second), Asinovskii et\nal. proposed the triple point vapor/liquid/graphite at\n\u223c 4000 K and 0.1 MPa (i.e. atmospheric pressure),\nin clear contradiction to the commonly accepted values [73] of \u223c 5000 K and 10 MPa. The next year\nthe same authors [77] published results concerning the\nposition of the graphite melting curve. With ohmic\nheating of graphite samples at heating rates of about\n100 K/minute, they found Tm = 3700 K at 0.25 MPa\n(typically, samples melted after one hour of steady\nheating).\nComing back to Bundy's work, during the experiments\non graphite melting Bundy and his group also investigated the graphitization of diamond by flash-heating\nunder pressure. Small diamond crystals where embedded in the graphite sample, pressurized and then flashheated. Experiments indicated that there is a sharp\ntemperature threshold at which the diamond crystals\ncompletely graphitized. This threshold is a few hundreds degrees lower than the graphite melting curve.\nAttempts to obtain direct (i.e. without resorting to a\ncatalyst material) conversion of graphite into diamond\nby the application of high pressure date back to the\nbeginning of the twentieth century. Success came only\nin 1961, when De Carli and Jamieson [78] reported the\nformation and retrieval of very small black diamonds\nwhen samples of low-density polycrystalline graphite\nwere shock compressed to pressures of about 30 GPa.\nLater in 1961 Alder and Christian [79] reported results on the shock compression of graphite that were\nin substantial agreement with those of De Carli and\nJamieson.\nBundy [80] achieved direct conversion of graphite\ninto diamond by flash-heating graphite sample in\na static pressure apparatus, at pressures above the\ngraphite/diamond/liquid triple point. The threshold\ntemperature of the transformation was found several\nhundred degrees below the melting temperature of the\ngraphite, and decreasing at higher pressures. The\nphase transition was revealed by a sharp drop in the\nelectrical conductivity of the samples (that were retrieved as pieces of finely polycrystalline black diamond).\nBy linking his own results with earlier experimental\nand theoretical findings, Bundy [80] proposed in February 1963 a phase diagram of carbon at high pressures\nthat is illustrated in Fig. 3. The diamond melting curve\nwas believed to have negative slope by analogy with the\nother Group IV elements [81, 82]), and on the basis of\nevidence collected during the experiments of Alder and\nChristian [79].\nIn 1973 Van Vechten [83] predicted the phase diagram\nof carbon by rescaling the behavior of other Group IV\n\n6\n\n\ftechniques were immediately applied to the determination of the properties of liquid carbon (i.e. whether it is\na conducting metallic liquid or an insulator). Unfortunately, due to the difficulties in interpreting the results\nof these experiments, the nature of the liquid state of\ncarbon is still not characterized experimentally.\nOn the theoretical side, the appearance of ever more\npowerful computers made it possible to use electronic\ndensity-functional (DF) theory [87, 88] to predict the\nproperties of materials under extreme conditions. In\n1983 Yin and Cohen [89] studied the total energy versus volume and the free energies versus pressure for\nthe six possible lattices of carbon (fcc, bcc, hcp, simple cubic, \u03b2-tin, diamond). The study was carried out\nby using ab initio pseudopotential theory (this permits\nthe investigation of the properties of the atomic system at 0 K). Yin and Cohen found that the calculated zero-pressure volume for diamond is either close\nto or even smaller than those of the other five phases.\nThis is different from what is observed for the other\ngroup IV elements, Si and Ge, and defies the common\nnotion that diamond is an open structure and should\nhave higher specific volume than the close packed solid\nstructures. The relatively dense packing of diamond\nwould inhibit the phase transformations at high hydrostatic pressures that are observed for heavier group\nIV elements. In addition, it suggested a revision of\nthe other common notion that the diamond melting\ncurve should have negative slope, something that is\nto be expected when a liquid is denser than the coexisting solid. Yin and Cohen also found that, at a\npressure around 2300 GPa, diamond converts to a simple cubic (sc) phase. This work was later extended\n[90, 91, 92] to consider also complex tetrahedral structures. It was found that a distorted diamond structure\ncalled BC-8 was stable versus diamonds at pressures\nabove 1000 GPa (see Fig. 4).\nIn 1984 Shaner and coworkers [93] shock compressed\ngraphite and measured the sound velocity in the material at shock pressures ranging from 80 to 140 GPa,\nand corresponding shock temperatures ranging from\n1500 to 5500 K. They measured velocities close to\nthose of an elastic longitudinal wave in solid diamond. These velocities are much higher than those\nof a bulk wave in a carbon melt. Since no melt\nwas detected at pressures and temperatures well above\nthe graphite/diamond/liquid triple point, the diamond\nmelting curve should, according to these results, have\na positive slope. In 1990 Togaya [94] reported experiments in which specimens of boron-doped semiconducting diamond were melted by flash-heating at\npressures between 6 and 18 GPa: these experiments\nprovided clear indications that the melting tempera-\n\nFigure 3: The phase diagram of carbon at high pressures proposed by Bundy in 1963 [80].\n\nelements that are experimentally more accessible, using the electronegativity as a scale parameter. In 1979\nGrover [84] calculated a phase diagram by using a\nphenomenological equation of state for the description\nof various solid and liquid phases of carbon. He used\nphysically motivated approximations for the free energies of the various phases, with parameters adjusted to\nmatch the available data on the equations of state. He\nconcluded that, at all pressures, diamond transforms,\nbefore melting, into a solid metallic phase.\nOn the basis of experimental evidence [85], in 1978\nWhittaker [1] proposed the existence of a novel crystalline phase for elemental carbon, called \"carbyne\".\nThe stability region of carbyne is sketched in Fig. 4)\nand the structure of this phase (though expected in\ndifferent allotropes) is generally that of a chains of alternated single and triple bonds, i.e. (\u2212C\u2261C\u2212)n , arranged in a hexagonal array bundled by dispersion interactions. The existence of a carbyne form was later\nquestioned by Smith and Buseck [2], who claimed that\nall the experimental evidence could also be accounted\nfor by the presence of sheet silicates. This dispute continued to this day: the experimental evidence for the\nexistence of carbyne is still being debated.\nIn recent years, the experimental effort has focused on\nthe collection of reliable data at even higher pressures,\nand on the investigation of the properties of the different phases of carbon at high temperatures and pressures. This challenging task has been faced both with\nexperiments and theory. On the experimental side, the\ndevelopment of the diamond-anvil cell [6] for high pressure physics has made it crucial to know the range of\nstability of diamond under extreme conditions. The\navailability of high-energy pulsed laser sources led to\nnew tools for heating up samples at very high temperatures (above the graphite melting curve) [86]. These\n7\n\n\fture of diamond increases with pressure.\nIn the same year ab-initio molecular dynamics (MD)\nstudies [95] clearly showed that, upon melting diamond at constant density, the pressure of the system\nincreases. These results imply that, at the densities\nstudied, the slope of the melting curve of diamond is\npositive. The shape of the diamond melting curve has\ninteresting consequences for the theory of planetary\ninteriors. Given our present knowledge of the phase\ndiagram of carbon and the existing estimates for the\ntemperatures and pressures in the interior of the outer\nplanets Neptune and Uranus, as well as in the Earth\nmantle, one might conclude that in a large fraction of\nthese planetary interiors the conditions are such that\ndiamond should be the stable phase of carbon [96]; diamonds could then be expected to occur wherever the\ncarbon concentration is sufficiently high. In section\n5 we show that, when only homogeneous nucleation\nis considered, our modelling predict that the driving\nforce for diamond nucleation is missing in giant planet\ninteriors. In 1996 Grumbach and Martin [97] made a\nsystematic investigation of the solid and liquid phases\nof carbon over a wide range of pressures and temperatures by using ab initio MD. These authors studied\nthe melting of the simple cubic and BC-8 solid phases,\nand investigated structural changes in the liquid in the\nrange 400-1000 GPa. They observed that the coordination of the liquid changes continuously from about\nfour-fold to about six-fold over this pressure range.\nIn 2004, Bradley et al. [98] reported experiments on\nlaser-induced shock compression of diamond up to 3000\nGPa. Through optical reflectivity measurements, they\nfound for the first time direct evidences of diamond\nmelting, at an estimated pressure of P = 1000 \u00b1\n200 GPa, and temperature T = 12000 \u00b1 4000 K.\nFig. 4 summarizes the information about phase diagram of carbon at the time when the present research\nwas started.\n\n3.2\n\nFigure 4: In 2004, a schematic representation of the\nphase diagram of carbon at high pressures would have\nlooked more or less as indicated in this figure. Full\ncurves correspond to phase boundaries for which thermodynamic data are available. More recent developments are discussed in the next section.\n\nistence pressures at T = 4000 K were located. In turn,\nthese coexistence points served as the starting point\nfor the determination of the graphite melting line, the\ndiamond melting line, and the graphite-diamond coexistence curve, obtained by integrating the ClausiusClapeyron equation (a procedure also known as Gibbs\u2206v\ndT\n= T\u2206h\nwhere \u2206v is the\nDuhem integration) [100]: dP\ndifference in specific volume, and \u2206h the difference in\nmolar enthalpy between the two phases.\nWe proceeded by first determining the Helmholtz\nfree energy at a given density and temperature by thermodynamic integration and subsequently calculating\nthe chemical potential using the procedure described\nin Ref. [101]. Coexistence at a given T is found at the\nP where the different \u03bc cross.\nFor all phases, the Helmholtz free energy F z of the\ninitial state point (P = 10 GPa, T = 4000 K) was determined by transforming the system into a reference\nsystem of known free energy F ref . The transformation was imposed by changing the interaction potential: U\u03bb = (1 \u2212 \u03bb)U z + \u03bbU ref . Here, U z and U ref\ndenote the potential energy function of the LCBOPI+\nand the reference system, respectively. The transformation is controlled by varying the parameter \u03bb continuously from 0 to 1. The free-energy change upon\nthe transformation was determined by thermodynamic\nintegration:\n\nCarbon phase diagram according to\nLCBOP\n\nMethods We performed Monte Carlo simulations on\nthe LCBOPI+ model of carbon [39, 46] to estimate the\nproperties of the liquid, graphite, and diamond phases\nof carbon. Coexistence curves were determined by locating points in the P \u2212T diagram with equal chemical\npotential for the two phase involved. For this purpose,\nwe first determined the chemical potential for the liquid, graphite, and diamond at an initial state point\n(P = 10 GPa, T = 4000 K). This state point is near the\nestimated triple point[99].

General guidelines for these kind\nof calculations are given in [102, 101], while a full description of the strategy adopted for the present systems is given in [55]. The ensemble averages needed for\nthe thermodynamic integration were determined from\nMonte Carlo (MC) simulations of a 216-particle system\nin a periodically replicated simulation box. For simulations of the graphite phase, the atoms were placed\nin a periodic rectangular box with an initial edge-size\nratio of about 1 : 1.5 : 1.7. For the liquid phase and\ndiamond a periodic cubic box was used.\nFrom the Helmholtz free energy to the chemical potential The chemical potential \u03bc along the\n4000 K isotherm was obtained by integrating from the\ninitial state point a fit, P (\u03c1) = a+b\u03c1+c\u03c12 , through simulated (P, T ) state points along the 4000 K isotherm.\nHere, \u03c1 is the number density, and a, b, and c are fit parameters.

The crosses represent experimental estimates\nfor graphite/diamond coexistence from Ref. [80]. The\nasterisk represent the theoretical graphite/diamond coexistence at zero kelvin, as reported in Ref. [73].\n\nFigure 8: Phase diagram of carbon at between 0\nand 400 GPa. The thick solid curves are our calculated phase boundaries. The dashed curve is the\nmetastable prolongation of the graphite melting curve,\nfrom Gibbs-Duhem integration; the curve stops just\nbefore the simulated graphite became unstable, displaying large density fluctuations. The dashed-dotted\ncurve departing from the experimental estimate for the\ntriple point (solid circle with error bar [73, 103, 99])\nis the diamond melting curve calculated in Ref. [104]\nwith the BrennerI potential. The solid circle is the final point of the shock wave experiment of Ref. [93] at\nwhich diamond is not yet melted. The crosses mark the\n(metastable) liquid state points with an equal fraction\nof three and four-fold coordinated atoms. The circles\nrepresent state points at which the liquid freezes.\n\nthe fitted curves. The fit parameters are listed in\nTable 1.\nEmploying subsequently Eq. 7 we obtained the calculated chemical potential \u03bc along the\n4000 K isotherm for the liquid, graphite, and diamond phase. The intersections of the chemical potential curves yield the graphite/liquid coexistence at\n6.72 \u00b1 0.60 GPa (\u03bcGL = \u221224.21 \u00b1 0.10 kB T ), and\nthe graphite/diamond coexistence at 15.05 \u00b1 0.30 GPa\n(\u03bcGD = \u221223.01 \u00b1 0.03 kB T ). The third intersection\nlocates a diamond/liquid coexistence at = 12.75 \u00b1\n0.20 GPa (\u03bcDL = \u221223.24 \u00b1 0.03 kB T ). Even though\nboth diamond and the liquid are there metastable, the\nClausius-Clapeyron integration of the diamond melting curve can be started at the metastable coexistence\npoint at 4000K. Starting from the three coexistence\npoints at 4000 K, the coexistence curves were traced\nby integrating the Clausius-Clapeyron equation using\nthe trapezoidal-rule predictor-corrector scheme [100].\nThe new value of the coexisting P at a given T was\ntaken when two iterations differed less than 0.01 GPa,\nthis being the size of the single uncertainty in the calculation of dP/dT . Typically this required 2-3 iterations.\nThe calculated phase diagram in the P \u2212 T plane\nis shown in Fig. 7 for the low pressure region, and in\nFig. 8 for the pressures up to 400GPa. Tab. 2 lists the\n\ndensities of selected points on the coexistence curves.\nThe three coexistence curves meet in a triple point at\n16.4 \u00b1 0.7 GPa and 4250 \u00b1 10 K.\nThe graphite/diamond coexistence curve agrees well\nwith the experimental data. In the region near the liquid/graphite/diamond triple point that has not been\ndirectly probed in experiments, the graphite/diamond\ncoexistence curve bends to the right, departing from\nthe commonly assumed straight line. Analysis of our\ndata shows this is mainly due to the rapid reduction\nwith increasing pressure of the interplanar distance in\ngraphite at those premelting temperature. This causes\nan enhanced increase of the density in graphite, yielding a decrease of dT /dP .\nTable 2 shows the melting enthalpy \u2206hm for graphite\nand diamond. These are calculated as the difference in\nenthalpy between the solid and the liquid at coexistence. Our calculated melting enthalpies of graphite\nare significantly lower than the values of \u223c 110 kJ/mol\nthat were reported in recent shock-heating melting experiments [73, 74]. Nonetheless our values retain the\nfeature of being rather constant along the graphite\nmelting curve.

Note, that they monotonically increase with\ntemperature.\nThe calculated graphite melting temperature is\nmonotonically increasing with pressure and is confined\nto small temperature range around 4000 K. In contrast to data inferred from experiments it shows no\nmaximum and is at a somewhat lower temperature. In\nagreement with the experiments the coexistence temperature is only slowly varying with pressure. Inspection reveals that this behavior is due to a limited variability of the melting enthalpy, and a similar bulk modulus for liquid and graphite yielding a volume change\nupon melting that is almost constant along the melting\ncurve.\nThe sign of the slope of the diamond melting curve is\nconsistent with the available experimental data [93, 73]\n(see Fig. 8). When compared to the diamond melting\ncurve of the BrennerI model [104], the LCBOPI+ diamond melting curve has a steeper slope yielding significantly higher temperatures for the diamond melting curve. Recently, the melting curve of diamond in\na range up to 2000 GPa has been studied by ab initio\nMD simulations using density functional theory. Wang\net al. [105] determined the relative stability of the diamond and liquid phase by evaluating the free energy of\nboth phases. Correa et al. [106] determined the melting\ntemperature using a \"two phase\" simulation method,\nwhere the system initially consists of a liquid and a diamond structure that are in contact. Subsequently the\n\n4.1\n\nHistory of the LLPT near the\ngraphite melting line\n\nAnalysis of experimental data The possibility of a\nLLPT in liquid carbon was first investigated by Korsunskaya et al. [36], who analysed data on the graphite\nmelting curve proposed by Bundy [65], (those data\nshowed a maximum melting temperature at 6.5 GPa).\nBy fitting the data from Bundy into the original two\nlevels model of Kittel [34] and postulating the existence\nof two liquids, Korsunskaya et al. found the critical\ntemperature Tc of the LLPT. The model is fitted with\nthree points on the graphite melting curve, with the\nrespective derivatives, and with the heat of melting at\none selected pressure. The fitting procedure gives an\nestimate for the critical pressure of \u223c 6.5 GPa and for\nthe critical temperature of the searched transition at\n3770 K, i.e. below the melting temperature. The fitted\nvalue for the entropy of freezing is the same for the two\nliquids, thus implying a vertical slope (dT /dP ) of the\ncoexistence curve (in the metastable liquid region just\nbelow the critical temperature)\nOn the basis of these results, the authors were able to\ncalculate also the diamond melting curve: they predicted it to have a negative slope, in accordance with\n1 The difference between these two values gives a hint on the\nuncertainties related to the two different methods used for calculating coexistence, given that the DF-MD set-up is quite similar\nin the two works\n\n11\n\n\fthe commonly accepted interpretation of the experiments of Alder and Christian [79]. Note that the slope\nof the graphite melting curve, and the slope of the diamond/graphite coexistence, as extracted from Bundy's\ndata [80, 65], together with the densities of the phases\nobtained by fitting to the two levels model implied (via\nClausius-Clapeyron equation) a negative slope of the\ndiamond melting curve. Different values of the slopes\nof the graphite boundary curves, and of the densities\nof the phases can yield rather different slope of the diamond melting curve.\nConsistent with the slope of the fitted graphite melting curve, the low density liquid is predicted less dense\nthan the coexisting graphite, and the high density liquid more dense than the coexisting graphite. The nature of the two liquids was predicted as follows: at low\npressure graphite melts into a liquid of neutral particles that interact predominantly through dispersion\n(London) forces. Upon increasing pressure the liquid\nwould transform into a metallic close packed liquid. No\nassumptions were made on the local structure.\nA semi-empirical equation of state The modern\ndiscussion on the LLPT for carbon, starts with the\nelaboration of a semi-empirical equation of state for\ncarbon, valid also at high P and T , by van Thiel and\nRee [108, 99]. This equation of state was constructed\non the basis of experimental data and electronic structure calculations. It postulated the existence, in the\ngraphite melt, of a mixture of an sp2 and an sp3 liquid. By assuming the model of pseudo-binary mixture\nfor the description of the mixing of the two liquids [38],\nVan Thiel and Ree showed that fitting their empirical equation of state to the graphite melting points\nof Bundy [65], they predict a graphite melting curve\nthat shows a maximum with a discontinuous change of\nthe slope, so that a first order LLPT arises. On the\nother hand, if they fit their model to the data from\nRef. [109], the predicted Tc of the LLPT drops below\nthe melting curve and the transition between the two\nliquids becomes continuous in the stable liquid region.\nAs pointed out by Ponyatovsky [110] the expression\nfor the mixing energy of the two liquid as proposed\nby van Thiel and Ree in [108, 99] involves two ambiguities. Firstly, extrapolating the coexistence curve\nbetween the two liquids at atmospheric pressure, the\ncoexistence temperature would be T \u223c 3700 K: this\nwould imply that the sp3 liquid (and the glass) would\nbe more stable than the sp2 at ambient pressure up to\nvery high temperatures, which is in disagreement with\nthe experimental data. Furthermore, the mixing energy is proposed to have a linear dependence on T , so\nthat, when T \u2192 0, also the mixing energy would tend\nto zero, i.e. at zero temperature the regular solution\n\nwould become an ideal solution. This would be rather\nunusual.\nExperimental evidence from the graphite melting curve Using flash-heating experiments Togaya [74]\ndetermined the melting line of graphite and found\na maximum in the melting curve at Pmax = 5.6\nGPa. This author fitted the six experimental points\nwith two straight lines: with positive slope at pressures lower than Pmax , with negative slope at pressures higher than Pmax . The apparent discontinuity at the maximum would imply the presence of a\ntriple point graphite/ low-density-liquid (LDL) / highdensity-liquid (HDL), as a starting point of a LLPT\ncoexistence curve.\nPrediction of a short-range bond-order potential In Ref. [103] Glosli and Ree reported a complete\nstudy of a LLPT simulated with the 'BrennerI' bondorder potential [52] in its version with torsional interactions [111]. The authors simulated in the canonical\n(NVT) ensemble several samples at increasing densities at eight different temperatures. By measuring the\npressure, they show the familiar van der Waals loop\nbetraying mechanical instability over a finite density\nrange. Using the Maxwell equal-area construction, the\nauthors calculated the LLPT coexistence curve, ending\nin a critical point at T = 8802 K and P = 10.56 GPa.\nThe lowest temperature coexistence point was calculated at T = 5500 K and P = 2.696 GPa. The\nLDL/HDL coexistence curve should meet the graphite\nmelting curve at its maximum, but unfortunately the\nBrennerI potential does not contain non bonded interactions, thus it can describe neither bulk graphite nor\nits melting curve. To overcome this deficiency, the authors devised an ingenious perturbation method. Assuming constant slope of the negative sloped branch\nof the graphite melting curve (the authors adopted\nthe graphite melting curve measured by Togaya [74])\nand fixing the graphite/diamond/HDL triple point at a\nvalue taken from the experimental literature, they give\nan estimate of the graphite/LDL/HDL triple point, at\nT = 5133 K and P = 1.88 GPa. The LDL was found to\nbe mainly two-fold (sp) coordinated with a polymericlike structure, while the HDL was found to be a network forming, mainly four-fold, (sp3 ) liquid. Following\nthe predictions of this bond-order potential, the sp2\ncoordinated atoms would be completely avoided in the\nliquid. The authors identified the reason in the presence of torsional interactions. In fact, the increase in\ndensity demands an increase in structures with higher\ncoordination than the sp, which is entropically favored\nat low densities. The single bonds of the sp3 structures\ncan freely rotate around the bond axis, while bonds\nbetween sp2 sites are constrained in a (almost) planar\n\n12\n\n\fgeometry by the torsional interactions: this implies a\nlow entropy for a liquid dominated by sp2 sites. This\nlow entropy would eventually destabilize the sp2 sites\ntowards the sp3 . To prove this conjecture, the authors\ncalculated two relevant isotherms in the original version of the potential, without torsional interactions,\nfinding no sign of a LLPT. Since some torsional interactions are definitely needed to mimic the double\nbond reluctancy to twist, the authors concluded that\nthe LLPT predicted by the Brenner bond-order potential with torsion is more realistic than its absence when\ntorsional interactions are switched off.\nTight binding calculations [112] showed no evidence of\nvan der Waals loops at some of the temperatures analyzed in Ref. [103]. As Glosli and Ree note, the tight\nbinding model used in [112] is strictly two-center, thus\nthe torsional interactions cannot be described.\nAn ab initio study of the LLPT In Ref. [45], Wu\net al. reported a series of NVT-CPMD simulations\nat 6000 K from density 1.27 to 3.02 103 kg/m3 , in a\nrange where the BrennerI potential showed the first order LLPT at the same T . No sign of a van der Waals\nloop was found: in contrast to the BrennerI results of\nthe previous paragraph, two approaching series starting from the lowest and the highest density, were found\nto meet smoothly at intermediate densities. Looking\nfor the reasons of the failure of the BrennerI potential,\nthe authors calculated, with the same functional used\nin the CPMD simulations, the torsional energy of two\nmodel molecules. One, (CH3 )2 C=C(CH3 )2 , was chosen so that the bond between the two central atoms\nrepresents a double bond in a carbon network: two\nsp2 sites are bonded each to two sp3 sites; the peripheral hydrogens are needed to saturated the sp3 atoms\nand are intended to have no effect on the central bond.\nThe second molecule, (CH2 )2 C-C(CH2 )2 is a portion\nof a completely sp2 coordinated network: in the bondorder language, the central bond is conjugated. The\ntwo molecules were geometrically optimized in their\nplanar configurations and then twisted around the central bond axis in steps of \u03c0/12. In each configuration\nthe electronic wave function was optimized, without\nfurther relaxations, to give the total energy, that was\ncompared to the planar configuration total energy. The\ndifference is the torsional energy. The DF calculations\nfound a surprising picture: while the double bond torsional energy was only slightly overestimated by the\nBrennerI potential at intermediate angles, the DF torsional energy for the conjugated bond showed a completely different scenario compared to the classical prediction. It shows a maximum at \u03c0/4, while the planar\nand orthogonal configuration have basically the same\nenergy. For the BrennerI potential, the torsional en-\n\nergy in this conjugated configuration is monotonically\nincreasing with the torsion angle, just as for the double bond configuration. On average, considering that\nthe conjugated configuration would be characteristic\nof a mainly sp2 coordinated liquid, the torsional interactions are enormously overestimated by the classical\npotential. As a further illustration, the authors tried\nto lower torsional energy of the conjugated bond in\nthe classical potential, by tuning the proper parameter, and found a much less pronounced LLPT. Note\nthat the functional form of the torsional interactions\nfor the BrennerI potential cannot reproduce the DF\ndata mentioned here. Wu et al. concluded that \"[the]\nBrenner potential significantly overestimates the torsional barrier of a chemical bond between two- and\nthree-center-coordinated carbon atoms due to the inability of the potential to describe lone pair electrons\";\nand: \"[the] Brenner potential parameters derived from\nisolated hydrocarbon molecules and used in the literature to simulate various carbon systems may not be\nadequate to use for condensed phases, especially so in\nthe presence of lone pair electrons\". In the next section\nwe show that the conclusion of Wu et al. is not necessarily true for all BOPs; indeed, LCBOPI+ , the carbon\nbond-order potential proposed by Los and Fasolino (see\nsection 2), includes a definition of the torsional interaction which is able to reproduce relevant features of\nliquid carbon, as they are described by DF-MD.\n\n4.2\n\nRuling out the LLPT in the stable\nliquid region via LCBOP\n\nWe have already indicated that the change of the structure of the liquid along the graphite and diamond melting curve is related to the slope of the melting curve.\nMore importantly, it plays also a crucial role in the nucleation of diamond in liquid carbon. The latter will\nbe further discussed in the next section.\nThe calculated melting curves of the LCBOPI+\nmodel for carbon up to 400 GPa provide strong evidence that there is no LLPT in the stable liquid phase.\nOne indication is the smoothness of the slopes of the\nmelting curves. A further argument lies in the structure of the liquid near freezing. Below we discuss this\nin more detail.\nThe calculated phase diagram (Figs. 7 and 8) does\nnot show the sharp maximum in the graphite melting\nline that was inferred from the calculated first-order\nLLPT for the BrennerI bond-order potential[103]. As\nwe mentioned in the previous section, subsequent DFMD simulations of liquid carbon [45, 46] indicate that\nthe BrennerI LLPT is spurious: it originates from an\ninadequate description of the torsional contribution to\n\n13\n\n\f1\n\nthe interactions. We have extended the calculation of\nthe graphite melting curve of LCBOPI+ towards higher\npressures into the region where both graphite and the\nliquid are metastable with respect to diamond. It is\nplotted as a dashed curve in Fig. 8 that shows the same\ntrend as at lower pressures. Hence, the calculated slope\nof the graphite melting curve is incompatible with the\nexistence of a LLPT in this region of the carbon phase\ndiagram.\n\nThe interrelation between three and four-fold sites,\nwas further investigated calculating the partial radial\ndistribution functions (gij (r)) of the liquid at 300 GPa,\nand 10500 K. Partial radial distribution functions are\ndefined as the probability of finding a j-fold site at a\ndistance r from a i-fold site; the total\ndistribuP radial P\ntion function g is recovered by: g = i gii +2 i6=j gij .\nWe show the results in Fig. 10; we focus on the\nthree predominant curves, describing the pair correlations between three-fold atoms (g33 ), between fourfold atoms (g44 ), and the cross pair correlation between three- and four-fold sites (g34 ). Disregarding the\nrather pronounced minimum in correspondence of the\ndip around 2 \u00c5 of the g33 and the g34 , the similarity of three curves at all distances r is striking. The\ntwo sites are almost undistinguishable: in case of a\ntendency towards a phase transition, one would expect\nsome segregation of the two structures. In contrast,\nlooking at distances within the first neighbours shell, a\n\nCoordination fraction\n\n0.6\n\nTwofold\nThreefold\nFourfold\n\n0.4\n\n0.2\n\n0\n\n3\n\n4 [103 kg/m3]\n\nDensity\n\n2\n\nPressure\n\n3.97\n\n19.8\n\n59.4\n\n148.1\n\nTemperature 3900\n\n4450\n\n6000\n\n8000\n\n2.5\n\n3.5\n\n331 [GPa]\n11000 [K]\n\nFigure 9: Coordination fraction of the liquid along\nthe melting curve of carbon.

The dashed curve is the liquid/graphite/diamond\ntriple point.

Fig. 9 shows the coordination fraction in the liquid along the coexistence curves\nup to 400 GPa, as function of temperature, pressure\nand density, with a linear scale in density. The dashed\ncurve is the calculated graphite/diamond/liquid triple\npoint. Along the graphite melting curve, the threefold and two-fold coordination fractions remain rather\nconstant, with the four-fold coordination slightly increasing to account for the increase in density. Along\nthe diamond melting curve the three-fold coordinated\natoms are gradually replaced by four-fold coordinated\natoms. However, only at (3.9 103 kg/m3 , 300 GPa,\nand 10500 K) the liquid has an equal fraction of threefold and four-fold coordinated atoms. The change of\ndominant coordination is rather smooth. Moreover, we\nhave verified that it is fully reversible showing no sign\nof hysteresis in the region around the swapping of dominant coordination. We note, that these results contradict the generally assumed picture (see e.g. Ref. [99])\nthat diamond melts into a four-fold coordinated liquid. Our calculations suggest that up to \u223c300 GPa\nthe three-fold coordination dominates.\n\n0.8\n\ng34\ng35\ng45\n\n0.2\n0.1\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\nr [\u00c5]\n\n4\n\n5\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\nr [\u00c5]\n\nFigure 10: Partial distribution functions gij of the liquid at the calculated coexistence with diamond, at\n10500 K and \u223c 300 GPa, when three- and four-fold\natoms are equally present.

Furthermore, the partial structures up to the third, quite pronounced, peak\nat \u223c 4.5 \u00c5, are almost the same for these three partial\nradial distribution functions.\nWe determined the properties of the metastable liquid in the stable diamond region. Fig. 8 shows the liquid P \u2212 T state points (crosses) that exhibit an equal\nnumber of three and four-fold coordinated atoms. It\nranges from the high-pressure high-temperature region\nwhere the liquid is thermodynamically stable down into\nthe diamond region, where the liquid is metastable for\nthe LCBOP. The circles indicate state points in which\nthe LCBOP liquid freezes in the simulation. Enclosed\nby the two set of points lies what we baptized diamond-\n\n14\n\n\flike liquid. This is a mainly four-fold coordinated liquid with a rather pronounced diamond-like structure in\nthe first coordination shell and was discussed in [46].\nThis suggests that a (meta)stable liquid with a dominantly four-fold coordination may only exist for pressures beyond \u2248 100 GPa and could imply that the\nfreezing of liquid into a diamond structure might be\nseverely hindered for a large range of pressures beyond\nthe graphite/diamond/liquid triple point. In Ref. [46]\nit is also pointed out that at 6000 K the equation of\nstate shows a change of slope around the transition to\nthe four-fold liquid. At even lower temperature this\nfeature becomes more and more evident, but for temperatures lower than \u223c4500 K the liquid freezes into\na mainly four-fold coordinated amorphous structure.\nThis observation is consistent with quenching MD simulations [113, 114] to obtain the tetrahedral amorphous\ncarbon. In those simulations a mainly three-fold liquid\nfreezes into an almost completely four-fold amorphous.\nRecent fully ab-initio study of the diamond melting\nline [105, 106] predicted a maximum at pressures beyond the maximum pressure (400 GPa) we explored\nwith our potential. The maximum implies a liquid\ndenser than diamond at pressure higher than the pressure at which the maximum appears. The authors of\nboth works analyzed the structure of the liquid around\nthis maximum, finding no sign of abrupt change in density and/or coordination. This points towards excluding a LLPT between a four-fold and a higher-fold coordinate liquid; rather, a smooth transformation towards\na denser liquid is always observed.\n\nor more micro-crystallites exceed a critical size (the\n\"critical cluster\"): this phenomenon is called homogeneous nucleation. An estimate of the free-energy barrier the system has to cross in order to form critical\nclusters and of the rate at which those clusters form in\na bulk super-cooled liquid, can be obtained from Classical Nucleation Theory (CNT) [115]. CNT assumes\nthat \u2206G(n), the Gibbs free-energy difference between\nthe metastable liquid containing an n-particle crystal\ncluster and the pure liquid, is given by\n\u2206G(n) = S(n)\u03b3 \u2212 n|\u2206\u03bc|,\n\n(8)\n\nwhere S(n) is the area of the interface between an nparticle crystallite and the metastable liquid, \u03b3 is the\nliquid-solid surface free-energy per unit area, and \u2206\u03bc\nthe difference in chemical potential between the solid\nand the super-cooled liquid. The surface area S(n) is\nproportional to c(n/\u03c1S )2/3 , where the factor c depends\non the shape and the geometry of the cluster (e.g. c =\n16\u03c0/3 for a spherical cluster).\nThe top of the free-energy barrier \u2206G\u2217 to grow the\ncrystalline critical cluster is then given by\n\u2206G\u2217 = c\n\n\u03b33\n\n,\n\u03c12S |\u2206\u03bc|2\n\n(9)\n\nwhere \u03c1S is the number density of the stable phase and\nc indicates the geometrical properties of the growing\ncluster. From our simulations, we can only determine\nthe product c\u03b3: it is this quantity and the degree of\nsuper-saturation (\u2206\u03bc), that are needed to compute the\ntop of the free-energy barrier, and hence the nucleation\nrate.\n5 Diamond nucleation\nCNT relates R, the steady-state nucleation rate, i.e.\n+ the number of crystal clusters that form per second\nOur knowledge of the phase diagram of \"LCBOPI\n\u2217\ncarbon\" allows us to identify the regions of the phase per cubic meter, to \u2206G , the height of the free-energy\nbarrier\nthat\nhas\nto\nbe\ncrossed\nto nucleate the critical\ndiagram where diamond nucleation may occur.

Spontaneous crystal growth can ponentially on \u2206G\u2217 , a doubling of \u03b3 may change the\nonly proceed when, due to some rare fluctuation, one nucleation rate by many orders of magnitude.\n15\n\n\fBecause of the extreme conditions under which homogeneous diamond nucleation takes place, there have\nbeen no quantitative experimental studies to determine\nits rate. Moreover, there exist no numerical estimates\nof \u2206\u03bc and \u03b3 for diamond in super-cooled liquid carbon. Hence, it was thus far impossible to make even\nan order-of-magnitude estimate of the rate of diamond\nnucleation.\nResults We simulate a 2744 particles bulk liquid\ncarbon using periodic boundary conditions, with a cubic box whose edge is 18\u00c5. We make it metastable\nby undercooling it at constant pressure at two different state points, A{P = 85 GPa, T = 5000 K} and\nB{P = 30 GPa, T = 3750 K}. At both state points,\nthe liquid is super-cooled by (Tm \u2212 T )/Tm \u2248 25% below the diamond melting curve, Tm being the melting\nA\nB\ntemperature Tm\n= 6600 K and Tm\n= 5000 K, respectively.\nWe evaluate \u2206\u03bc by thermodynamic integration at\nconstant pressure from the melting point (\u03b2M =\n1/kB TM )\nZ \u03b2i\nh[hS (\u03b2) \u2212 hL (\u03b2)]iP d\u03b2\n(12)\n\u2206(\u03b2i \u03bc) =\n\nharmonics is due to the fact that both diamond and\ngraphite lattices have odd symmetry upon inversion of\ncoordinates.\nIn order to define the local order parameter, we start\nwith computing\nq3,m (i) =\n\n1 X down\nS\n(rij ) Y3m (r\u0302ij )\nZi\n\n(13)\n\nj6=i\n\nwhere the sum extends over all neighbors of particle i\nand over all values of m. Zi is the fractional number of\nneighbours and S down (rij ) is a smooth cut-off function,\nintroduced in the context of LCBOP I + [55] (see also\nSection II.A in [40]).\nBy properly normalizing Eq. 13, we get\n\u2032\nq3,m (i)\nq3,m (i) = Pl\n,\n\u2217 (i))1/2\n( m=\u2212l q3,m (i) * q3,m\n\n(14)\n\n\u2217\nbeing q3,m\nthe complex conjugate of q3,m .\nNext we define the dot product between the normal\u2032\nized function q3,m of particle i and the same function\ncomputed for each of its first neighbors, d3 (i, j), and\nsum them up over all the m values:\n\n\u03b2M\n\nwhere \u03b2i = 1/kB Ti , {i = A, B}, and h is the enthalpy\nper particle of the solid and liquid phase, respectively.\nWe then find: |\u2206\u03bcA /kB T | = 0.60 and |\u2206\u03bcB /kB T | =\n0.77.\nIn recent years several authors have been developing\nmethods for studying homogeneous nucleation from the\nbulk and detecting solid particles within the metastable\nliquid [116, 117, 118, 119]. Our study on diamond nucleation is based on these works, but it requires various adaptations due to the specificity of the carbon\ncovalent bond [55]. We have already shown that liquid\ncarbon is rather structured below its freezing curve.\nThis leads to the need of building a \"strict\" definition\nof \"crystallinity\" of a particle, in order to avoid an\noverestimation of the number of solid particles in the\nsystem.\nIn order to compute the nucleation free energy, we\nuse the biggest crystal cluster n as a local order parameter to quantify the transformation from the liquid to\nthe solid. To identify solid-like particles, we analyze the\nlocal environment of a particle using a criterion based\non a spherical-harmonics expansion of the local bond\norder. In practice, the present bond-order parameter is\nbased on rotational invariants constructed out of rank\nthree spherical harmonics (Y3m ). This choice allows\nus to identify the tetragonal symmetry of the diamond\nstructure, as already described in Ref. [55, 119], and it\nis also perfectly suited to find particles in a graphitelike environment. Our choice of odd-order of spherical\n\nd3 (i, j) =\n\nl\nX\n\nm=\u2212l\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2217\nq3,m (i) * q3,m\n(j)S down (rij ).\n\n(15)\n\nd3 (i, j) is a real number defined between -1 and 1: it assumes the value of -1 when computed for both graphite\nand diamond ideal structures.\nTwo neighboring particles i and j are considered\nto be connected whenever d3 (i, j) \u2264 dc = \u22120.87.\nThis value satisfactorily splits the distributions of solid\nparticles belonging to a thermalized lattice and liquid particles as found in a liquid. The histograms\nthat led us to this choice are thoroughly discussed\nin Refs. [55, 119]. By counting the total number of\nconnections (ncon ) and plotting the probability distribution of ncon , we define a threshold for the number\nof connections needed to neatly distinguish between\na liquid-like and a solid-like environment: we assume\nthat whenever ncon > nccon = 3 a particle is solid-like.\nAt this stage, we do not specify any nature of the particle's crystallinity, whether diamond-like or graphitelike. By means of a cluster algorithm we then define\nall the solid-like AND connected particles as belonging to the same crystal cluster. After computing the\nsize of each cluster, we use the size of the biggest cluster as the order parameter which describes the phase\ntransition [120].\nOnce properly identified the biggest crystalline cluster in the system, we use the umbrella sampling technique [121] to measure the free-energy barrier \u2206G\u2217 to\n\n16\n\n\fform a critical cluster at state point A. In order to\nbetter equilibrate the growing clusters, we implement\na \"parallel tempering\" algorithm similar to the one described in Ref. [122]. We obtain that, at state point\nA, \u2206G\u2217A is around 25 kB T for a critical cluster size of\nnA = 110. By fitting the initial slope of Eq. 8 to a polynomial function assuming a spherical growing cluster,\nwhile imposing the value of the correspondent supersaturation (\u03b2\u2206\u03bc =0.60), the inter-facial free energy is\n\u03b3A = 0.27kB T /\u00c52 \u2243 1.86 J m\u22122 . The same value of\n\u03b3A is obtained from the top of the free-energy barrier\nassuming a spherical cluster shape (Eq. 9) (\u03c1S = 0.191\n\u00c5\u22123 ). We underline the fact that at the chosen thermodynamic conditions, there are no finite size effects,\ncaused by spurious interaction of the critical cluster\nwith its own periodically repeated image.\nBy knowing the inter-facial free energy in A, and\nassuming the validity of CNT, we estimate the crystal nucleation rate by means of Eq. 10, where we use\nEq. 11 to compute the kinetic pre-factor (the atomic\njump distance \u03bb being of the order of the diamond bond\nCN T\ndistance, 1.54\u00c5): RA\n\u223c O(1030 ) s\u22121 m\u22123 .\nWe also use Forward-Flux Sampling (FFS), a relatively recent rare events technique useful to compute\nthe nucleation rate and to study the pathways to nucleation [123, 124, 119], and we measure the crystal nucleation rate at state point A. FFS yields an estimate\nfor the nucleation rate that is three orders of magnitude higher than the one estimated by means of Eq. 10.\nWhilst such a discrepancy seems large, it need not be\nsignificant because nucleation rates are extremely sensitive to small errors in the calculation of the nucleation\nbarrier. Two possible reasons for this discrepancy are:\n1) if we consider that the standard deviation corresponding to \u03b3 is around 10% of its measured value, we\nconclude that the nucleation rate is O(1030\u00b13 ) s\u22121 m\u22123 ;\n2) another source of error can be the poor statistics\nwhen computing the nucleation rate from molten carbon by means of FFS. This is due to the time consuming calculations of the interaction potential: in our\nstudy we are in fact forced to base our results on O(10)\nindependent nucleation events. Fig. 11 shows a typical\ncritical cluster at state point A obtained in the FFS\nsimulations: it contains around 110 particles, and it is\nsurrounded by mainly 4-fold coordinated liquid particles. The picture shows two different views of the same\ncluster: it appears evident that all particles within the\nbulk are diamond-like, whereas the particles belonging\nto the outer surface are less connected but still mainly\n3-4 fold coordinated.\nWe then attempt to compute the nucleation rate at\nstate point B by means of FFS and, even in rather\nlong simulations, we cannot observe the formation of\n\nFigure 11: Two different views of the biggest cluster at\nstate point A containing around 110 particles, surrounded\nby mainly 4-fold coordinated liquid particles.\n\nany crystal cluster containing more than 75 particles.\nHence, these calculations suggest that the nucleation\nrate at state point B measured by means of FFS is\naround zero. Figure 12 shows a 75 particles cluster con-\n\nFigure 12: Typical snapshot of a crystalline cluster of \u223c 75\nparticles obtained at state point B, surrounded by mainly\n3-fold coordinated liquid particles.\n\ntaining 3-fold coordinated surface particles surrounding the 4-fold coordinated bulk particles, while embedded in a 2-3 fold coordinated liquid.\nAs we are unable to grow critical nuclei with FFS,\nwe assume that a system of 2744 particles is too small\nto accommodate a spherical critical cluster. According\nto Classical Nucleation Theory (CNT) [115], the crystal nucleation rate depends exponentially on the height\nof the free-energy barrier (see Eq. 10). The latter is a\nfunction of the inter-facial free energy (\u03b3) cube and\ninversely proportional to the super-saturation (\u2206\u03bc)\nsquare. Since the super-saturation is quite similar in\nboth state points, the failure of the system to nucleate\nsuggests that the inter-facial free energy should play a\nmajor role. In order to estimate the free-energy barrier\nin state point B, as we know the solid number density\n(\u03c1S = 0.177 \u00c5\u22123 ) and the chemical potential difference between the liquid and the solid (\u03b2\u2206\u03bcB =0.77),\nwe only need to calculate the inter-facial free energy \u03b3.\nThus, in what follows, we focus on methods to estimate\n\n17\n\n\f\u03b3 at state point B.\nAs a spherical critical cluster does not fit in our simulation box, we prepare a rod-like crystal in a system\nwith a slab geometry: this is a flattened box containing around 4000 particles, with lateral dimensions that\nare some four times larger than its height. The crystal\nrod is oriented perpendicular to the plane of the slab,\nit spans the height of the simulation box and is continued periodically. The cross section of this crystal\nrod is initially lozenge shaped, such that its [111]-faces\nare in contact with the liquid. The [111]-planes are\nthe most stable ones for the diamond lattice. In fact,\nmacroscopic natural diamonds have often an octahedral shape, with eight [111]-exposed surfaces. Indeed,\nwe find stable [111] surfaces in all but the smallest studied diamond clusters.\nAt state point A clusters grow by the addition of\nparticles to the surface made of mainly [111]-planes.\nNote that when graphite and diamond structures compete at state point B (as shown in Fig. 12), the [0001]graphite sheets transform into [111] diamond planes.\nFig. 13 represents the top view at state point B of a\n\nJ m\u22122 . At the same time, computing the inter-facial\nfree energy of the rod-like crystal at state point A gives\nl\n= 0.37kB T /\u00c52 \u2243 2.55 J m\u22122 , considering the same\n\u03b3A\nslab's height and the same angle \u03b8.\nNow that we have estimates for the inter-facial free\nenergies of the lozenge-shaped clusters at both state\npoints A and B, we can estimate the ratio between\nthem and find that c\u03b3B /c\u03b3A = \u03b3B /\u03b3A \u2243 2.5. As we\ncompare clusters having the same shape, this ratio is\npresumably not very sensitive to the precise (and, a\npriori unknown) shape of the cluster shape. As the surface free energy at state point B is appreciably higher\nthan at state point A, the early stages of crystal formation at point B are strongly suppressed by the interfacial free-energy term. Since we know \u03b3A (referred\nto a hypothetical spherical cluster) and the ratio between the two \u03b3's, we can infer that the \"effective\"\n\u03b3B = 0.68kB T /\u00c52 \u2243 3.50 J m\u22122 .\nThis value of the surface free energy is so large that\nwe would indeed have needed a much larger system in\norder to accommodate the critical cluster at the state\nB thermodynamic conditions. \u00bfFrom Eq. 16, we calculate the critical cluster size for the lozenge-shaped\nparallelepiped n\u22172D and use it to estimate the size of a\ncritical spherical cluster n\u22173D in B:\nn\u22172D =\n\n(\u03b3)2\n4h\n.\n\u03c1S sin \u03b8 (\u2206\u03bc)2\n\n(17)\n\nAt state point B we find B n\u22172D \u223c330 particles. Expressing n\u22173D as a function of the lozenge-shaped parallelepiped one, we get\nn\u22173D =\nFigure 13: Top view of a rectangular parallelepiped formed\nby 4 [111]-faces and 2 [1-10]-lozenge bases with an acute\nangle \u03b8=70.52 degrees thermalized at state point B.\n\nrod-like crystal, formed by 4 [111]-faces and 2 bases as\n[1-10]-lozenge with the acute angles of \u03b8=70.52 degrees.\nWe then rewrite Eq. 8 for a rectangular parallelepiped\nhaving 4 faces and 2 lozenge-shaped basis\ns\nh\n\u03b3 l n1/2 \u2212 |\u2206\u03bc|n,\n(16)\n\u2206G = 4\n\u03c1 sin \u03b8\nwhere h is the slab's height. We then use Umbrella\nSampling to compute the initial slope of the freeenergy barrier. As h = 10 \u00c5, we obtain from fitting Eq. 16 that the inter-facial free energy for the\nl\nlozenge-shaped cluster is \u03b3B\n= 0.91kB T /\u00c52 \u2243 4.70\n\n8 \u03b3 sin \u03b8\n\u03c0\n\u00d7 n\u22172D ,\n3 \u03c1S \u2206\u03bch\n\n(18)\n\nwhere \u03c1S is the solid number density \u03c1B = 0.17 \u00c5\u22123 ,\n|\u2206\u03bcB /kB T | = 0.77, and h the height of the slab (10 \u00c5).\nThus, n\u22173D \u223c 1700 particles at state point B. To guarantee that the critical cluster does not interact with its\nown periodic images, its radius should always be less\nthan 25% of the box diameter L. A spherical cluster\nwith a radius of 0.25 L occupies \u223c 7 % of the volume\nof the box and, as the solid is denser than the liquid,\nit contains about 10 % of the total number of particles (N \u2248 17000). Such a large system size is beyond\nour present computational capacity. In contrast, in the\nslab geometry we find that the free energy of a lozengeshaped crystal goes through a maximum at a size of \u223c\n330 particles, which is much less than the system size\n(4000 particles).\nAs \u2206\u03bc and \u03c1B are known, we can now use CNT to estimate \u2206G\u2217 in state point B. It turns out that, mainly\nbecause \u03b3B is 2.5 times larger than \u03b3A , the nucleation\n\n18\n\n\fj6=i\n\nwhere the sum extends over all neighbors of particle\ni. We then sum over all the m values and calculate\nthe modulus, |q2 |. The |q2 | probability distribution for\nboth A and B is represented in Fig. 14. Figure 14 depicts the features of both the smallest (\u223c 20 in both\nstate points A and B) and the biggest clusters (\u223c 250\nin A and \u223c 75 in B). We also distinguish among:\nliquid-like particles (circles), particles belonging to the\nsurface of the largest cluster (squares), particles inside\nthe bulk cluster (diamonds) and particles belonging to\nthe first liquid layer surrounding the largest cluster (triangles). According to our definition, particles belonging to the surface of the cluster are those connected to\nsolid-like particles, but not solid-like themselves. Concerning particles belonging to the first liquid layer surrounding the cluster, they usually display the same behaviour as the ones belonging to the cluster surface,\nwhich is not surprising in view of the uncertainty in distinguishing a surface-particle from a first-liquid-layer\nparticle. To neatly distinguish between diamond-like\nor graphite-like environment, we use as a reference the\n|q2 | probability distribution for both bulk diamond (D)\nand graphite (G) (inset of Fig. 14).\nAt state point A, it is clear that bulk particles belonging to small clusters (bottom-left side) and big\nclusters (bottom-right side) are mainly diamond-like,\nas well as particles belonging to the surface of the\nclusters. In contrast, at state point B bulk particles\nbelonging to small clusters (top-left side) show both\ngraphite-like and diamond-like finger-prints.

As discussed in section 4.1\nabove (see also [46, 125]), liquid carbon is mainly 4-fold\ncoordinated at state point A (20% 3-fold and 80% 4fold ), whereas at the lower temperatures and pressures\nof point B, the coordination in the liquid resembles\nthat of graphite and is mainly 3-fold coordinated ( 5%\n2-fold, 85% 3-fold and 10% 4-fold ).\nWe can analyze the structure of the crystalline clusters that form in the supersaturated liquid carbon and\ndistinguish graphite-like from diamond-like particles.\nIn an a posteriori analysis, we use a different order parameter function of the order two spherical harmonics,\nand particularly sensitive to the graphite planar geometry. q2m (i) is the linear combination of spherical\nharmonics computed for each particle i\n1 X down\nS\n(rij ) Y2m (r\u0302ij )\n(19)\nq2m (i) =\nZi\n\n5000 K 85 GPa\n\n25\n20\n15\n10\n5\n0\n\nD\n\nG\n\n10\n5\n0\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n|q2|\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\n|q2|\n\nFigure 14: The top-left represents clusters of \u223c 20 and\nthe top-right clusters of \u223c 75 at state point B, whereas\nthe bottom-left clusters of \u223c 20 and the bottom-right clusters of \u223c 250 particles at state point A. The used code\nis: circles=liquid particles, squares=particles belonging to\nthe biggest cluster's surface, diamonds=particles within the\nbulk cluster, triangles=particles belonging to the first liquid layer surrounding the biggest cluster. The inset shows\nthe |q2 | probability distribution for an equilibrated bulk diamond (D) (left-hand side) and graphite (G) (right-hand\nside).\n\nsual inspection, we note that when clusters grow larger\n(around 75 particles), particles at the surface tend to\nbe mainly 3-fold coordinated, whereas bulk particles\nstay 4-fold coordinated, as shown in the top-right side\nof Fig. 14. The destabilizing effect of the graphitic liquid on the diamond clusters is most pronounced for\nsmall clusters (large surface-to-volume ratio): clusters\ncontaining less than 25 particles tend to be graphitic in\nstructure, clusters containing up to 60 particles show a\nmixed graphite-diamond structure (see Fig. 12). It appears that the unusual surface structure of the diamond\ncluster is an indication of the poor match between a diamond lattice and a 3-fold coordinated liquid.\n\n5.1\n\nConsequences for other network\nforming liquids, carbon-rich stars,\nUranus and Neptune\n\nAs discussed in the introduction, there are many\nnetwork-forming liquids that, upon changing pressure\nand temperature, undergo profound structural changes\nor even LLPT [29, 23, 126]. Interestingly, our simulations show that the ease of homogeneous crystal nucleation at constant super-saturation from one-and-thesame meta-stable liquid can be tuned by changing its\n\n19\n\n\fpressure, and thereby its local structure.\nPressures and temperatures that we investigate for\nthe diamond nucleation are in practice impossible to\nreach in experiments. However, such conditions are\nlikely to be found in several extraterrestrial \"laboratories\". Homogeneous nucleation of diamond may have\ntaken place in the atmosphere of carbon-rich binary\nstellar systems comprising the so-called carbon stars\nand white dwarfs [127, 128]. Closer to home, it has\nbeen suggested that diamonds could also have formed\nin the carbon-rich middle layer of Uranus and Neptune [96, 129, 130] where, due to the high pressure\nand temperature, the relatively abundant CH4 would\ndecompose into its atomic components. In fact, experiments on methane laser-heated in diamond anvil\ncells [131] found evidence for diamond production. Ab\ninitio simulations [132] also found that hot, compressed\nmethane will dissociate to form diamond. Yet, there is\na large discrepancy between the estimates of the pressures (and thus depth in the planet interior) at which\nthe diamond formation would take place. The laserheating experiments [131] suggested diamond formation at pressure as low as 10\u201320 GPa (at 2000\u20133000 K),\nwhereas the ab initio simulations [132] found dissociation of methane, but synthesis of short alkane-chains at\n\u223c 100 GPa and diamond at pressures not lower than\n300 GPa (note that simulations were carried out at\n4000\u20135000 K).\nThe present work allows us to make a rough estimate of\nthe conditions that are necessary to yield appreciable\ndiamond nucleation on astronomical timescales.\nIn this context, it is crucial to note that neither carbon stars nor carbon-rich planets consist of pure carbon. In practice, the carbon concentration may be as\nhigh as \u223c50% in carbon-rich stars [127, 128], but much\nless (1-2% [129, 96, 133, 130]) in Uranus and Neptune.\nTo give a reference point, it is useful to estimate an upper bound to the diamond nucleation rate by considering the rate at which diamonds would form in a hypothetical environment of pure, metastable liquid carbon.\nTo this end we use our numerical data on the chemical potential of liquid carbon and diamond and our\nnumerical estimate of the diamond-liquid surface free\nenergy, to estimate the nucleation barrier of diamond\nas a function of temperature and pressure. We then\nuse CNT to estimate the rate of diamond nucleation.\nTo do so, we need to extend the estimate of the nucleation rate from the triple point pressure (around 16\nGPa) up to 100 GPa, and from the melting temperaA\nB\ntures ( Tm\n= 6600 K and Tm\n= 5000 K, respectively)\nto 35 % under-cooling (at which diffusion in our sample becomes negligible on the - far from astronomical\n- time-scales of our simulations). To make such an\n\nextrapolation, we make use of Eqn.'s 10, 9, and 11.\nThe state-point dependent quantities are the solid and\nliquid number densities \u03c1L and \u03c1S , the self-diffusion coefficient D, the surface free energy \u03b3, the difference in\nchemical potential between the liquid and the solid \u2206\u03bc,\nand the critical cluster size n\u2217 . We estimate them in\nthe following way: the densities are directly measured\nby Monte Carlo simulations of the solid and the liquid;\nthe self diffusion coefficient is extrapolated assuming\nan Arrhenius behaviour of the metastable liquid (see\nAppendix B); the chemical potential difference is interpolated via Eq. 12 between 30 and 85 GPa. \u2206\u03bc\nthen also follows by linear interpolation. Concerning\nthe surface free-energy, we assume that \u03b3(P, T ) linearly\ndepends on c4 , the equilibrium concentration of 4-fold\ncoordinated atoms at the selected state point. This\nquantity is easily measured in the Monte Carlo simulations. The nucleation barrier height is given by Eq. 9,\nwhere the geometrical factor c is the same for all cluster\nsizes. It is obvious that we have to make rather drastic\nassumptions in order to estimate the nucleation rate\nin the experimentally relevant regime. We believe that\nour assumptions are reasonable, but one should not\nexpect the resulting numbers to provide more than a\nrough indication.\n\nFigure 15: The figure shows part of the carbon phase diagram from Ref. [134] and the iso-nucleation rate zones.\nThe solid red curves represent the coexistence curves from\nRef. [134]. PA = 85 GPa, TA = 5000 K and PB = 30 GPa,\nTB = 3750 K. Along the green dashed curve the ratio of\n3-fold and 4-fold coordination in the liquid is 1:1. The\nnumbers on the right indicate the base 10 logarithm (or\nthe order of magnitude) of the crystal nucleation rate from\nmolten carbon (in m\u22123 s\u22121 ).

If the rate is lower than this\nnumber, not a single diamond could have nucleated in\na Uranus-sized body during the life of the universe.\nAs can be seen from the figure, our simulations for\nstate point B are outside the regime where observable\nnucleation would be expected. Note that this latter\nconclusion is not based on any extrapolation.\nAs mentioned above, carbon stars and planets do not\nconsist of pure carbon. Hence, we have to consider the\neffect of dilution on the crystallization process. To do\nso, we make a very \"conservative\" assumption, namely\nthat nucleation takes place from an ideal mixture of C,\nN,O and H [135]. If this were not the case, then either\ndemixing would occur, in which case we are back to the\nprevious case, or the chemical potential of carbon in the\nliquid is lower than that in pure carbon, which would\nimply that the thermodynamic driving force for diamond crystallization is less than in pure liquid carbon.\nIn Fig. 16, we show how dilution affects the regime\nwhere diamond nucleation is possible. To simplify this\nfigure, we do not vary pressure and temperature independently but assume that they follow the adiabatic\nrelation that is supposed to hold along the isentrope of\nUranus [136] and we use the ideal-mixture expression\nfor the chemical potential \u03b2\u2206\u03bc = \u03b2\u2206\u03bc0 + \u03b2ln([C]),\nwhere \u03b2\u2206\u03bc0 is the chemical potential difference between the solid and the liquid for he pure substance\n(C) and [C] is the concentration of carbon in the fluid\nmixture.\nNot surprisingly, Fig. 16 shows that dilution of the\nliquid decreases the driving force for crystallization. In\nfact, no stable diamond phase is expected for carbon\nconcentrations below 8%. Moreover, there is a wide\nrange of conditions where diamonds could form in principle, but never will in practice. Assuming that, for a\ngiven pressure, the width of this region is the same as in\nthe pure C case (almost certainly a serious underestimate), we arrive at the estimate in Fig. 16 of the region\nwhere nucleation is negligible (i.e. less than one diamond per planet per life-of-the-universe). From this\nfigure, we see that quite high carbon concentrations\n(over 15%) are needed to get homogeneous diamond\nnucleation. Such conditions do exist in white dwarfs,\nbut certainly not in Uranus or Neptune.\n\n58\nDIAMOND\nNUCLEATION\n\n2000\n\n38\n0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n[C]\n\nFigure 16: Diamond nucleation boundary as a function of\ncarbon concentration: in the plot, the rate is zero (no thermodynamic driving force to nucleation) in the top region\n(liquid), it is negligible (< 10\u221240 m\u22123 s\u22121 ) in the middle\nregion and non-negligible (> 10\u221240 m\u22123 s\u22121 ) in the bottomright region. We call the nucleation rate negligible if it corresponds to less than one cluster per Uranus-sized planet\nover a period of 1010 years. The left hand y-axis represents the temperature; the right-hand y-axis indicates\nthe corresponding pressure for a Uranus-like isentrope (see\nRef.

Although LCBOPI+\ngave an improved description of most liquid phase\nproperties, like coordination distributions as a function\nof density, as compared to the bond-order potentials\nwithout LR interactions (Brenner, CBOP[138]), the radial distribution function showed a too marked minimum after the first shell of neighbors, as compared to\nab-initio calculations (see Fig. 23). This deficiency was\nattributed to the relatively short cut-off of 2.2 \u00c5 for\nthe SR interactions, giving rise to a spurious barrier for\nbond formation around 2.1 \u00c5. Therefore, for LCBOPII,\nthe total binding energy expression was extended with\nso-called MR interactions as:\nN\n\nat\n\u0001 lr\n1\n1X\nsr sr\nsr\nmr mr\nVij + p mr Sij\nSij\nVij + 1 \u2212 Sij\nVij\nEb =\n2 i,j\nZi\n(20)\nThe first two terms on the right-hand side represent\nsr\nthe SR and LR interactions respectively, where Sij\nsmoothly switches between both interactions within\nAppendix A: LCBOPII\nthe interval 1.7 \u00c5\u2264 rij \u2264 2.2 \u00c5, with S sr (1.7) = 1\nIn this appendix, we describe the main features of the and S sr (2.2) = 0.

However, since the\nvalues on the integer argument nodes are rather scattered, a spline unavoidably introduces unphysical oscillations. For LCBOPII, we found an alternative solution to this problem which is schematically illustrated\nin Fig. 22. In this approach, the conjugation term for\nconfigurations with fractional coordination is defined\nas a weighted superposition of conjugation terms for\n\nconj\nwhere Nij,c\nare the conjugation numbers for the four\nconfigurations in Fig. 22.\nResults with LCBOPII. LCBOPII proved to be\nmore accurate than its predecessors in describing defects and surfaces of the solid phases [40]. In the liquid\nphases the improvement of LCBOPII is immediately\nevident when looking at radial distribution functions at\ndifferent densities (Fig. 23). The main discrepancy between LCBOPI+ and the reference data from DF-MD\ncalculations [46, 54]) was found at the first minimum,\nat around 2 \u00c5. LCBOPI+ predicted a much deeper\nminimum than DF-MD. This discrepancy is completed\neliminated by LCBOPII. We also know that the melting line of diamond predicted by LCBOPII is about\n500 K lower than for LCBOPI+ at \u223c 60 GPa [54],\nmore consistently with ab-initio predictions of the diamond melting line [105, 106]. In [54] we also thoroughly\nanalyzed the properties of the liquid. Interestingly,\nby extrapolating the equations of state of the liquid\nat temperatures at which our relatively small samples\nactually froze, we found that a critical point for the\ngraphite-like into diamond-like transition is present at\n1230 K. The precise value might be inaccurate, since it\nis found far outside the sampled region, still the shapes\nof the higher temperature equations of state point towards the existence of such critical isotherm. As is the\ncase for the much speculated water LLPT [29, 30] an\nunreachable critical point might still be responsible of\nsome peculiar behaviour of the system at higher temperatures, such as the enormous change in nucleation\nrate with pressure.\n\nAppendix B: Self-diffusion coefficient\nWhen computing the kinetic pre-factor to get the nucleation rate, we have to consider the fact that for\nour model potential, LCBOPI+ , only a Monte Carlo\ncode is available. In order to evaluate the self-diffusion\ncoefficient needed to compute the CNT kinetic prefactor, we infer the scaling factor between the Monte\nCarlo \"time-step\" and the MD time-step [139] by propagating a 128 carbon atoms system via Car-Parrinello\n\n24\n\n\f3\n\nFedosayev [142] reported a measurement of the molten\ncarbon viscosity: \u03b7 = 5 \u00d71011 poise at T = 1860K.
