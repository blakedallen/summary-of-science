A hundred years ago, Sutherland\n1\n[14] found an empirical rule, that the product bTm M 6 is\nnearly constant for metals, where Tm is the melting temperature, b the mean coefficient of expansion, and M the\natomic mass. In the following year, he advanced a kinetic\ntheory of solids [15], in which he postulated that melting\nwould occur when the space between atoms reaches a certain value relative to the atomic diameter, so that atoms\nare able to escape from the imprisonment by their neighbors. He carried out a hard-sphere simulation experiment\nby shaking a box containing one layer of marbles, and\nnoting by removing marbles one at a time that the apparent solid-liquid transition occurs when a free volume\nof 25-33% is reached. From the vibration amplitude and\nthe thermal kinetic energy, together with the above empirical melting rule, Sutherland [15] calculated the period\nof vibrations of metal atoms at the melting temperature,\nand found that the ratio of vibration amplitude to atomic\nspacing is nearly the same for all elements at melting.\nIn 1910, Lindemann [16] combined Sutherland's ideas\nwith the Debye theory of specific heat in solids, and derived his famous rule according to which a quasi-universal\nparameter, the Lindemann number, should be the same\nfor all melting transitions. The number is usually stated\nin the form\nL = \u03b8v 1/3 (M/Tm )1/2\nwhere \u03b8 is the Debye temperature and v the volume per\natom. Subsequent extensive tests of this rule were carried out by Gschneidner [17], Ross [18], and Crawford\n[19] who found, however, that Lindemann's rule is not\nvery reliable. First, the Debye temperature cannot be\nprecisely specified since the Debye theory of specific heat\nis itself approximate. Second, extracting \u03b8 from the data\nby a best fit of the Debye theory, the Lindemann number\nvaries considerably from material to material, as emphasized by Wallace [20].\nThe most unsatisfactory feature of the Lindemann rule\nis that its size is unknown and has to be extracted\n\nfrom an average of many melting transitions. Thus,\nthe Sutherland-Lindemann approach to melting has remained a purely phenomenological rough description of\nthe transition. In spite of its roughness, it is often used\neven today in many works to estimate melting temperature, this being due to a lack of a more precise melting\ntheory.\nDuring the past two decades, several other melting theories have been developed. One is based on density functionals [21, 22], and has provided us with an alternative insight into the melting transition. This work, however, describes satisfactorily only the long-wave length\nlimit of fluctuations, and neglects the important role of\nthe lattice structure, thus requiring essential corrections,\nwhich sometimes have been inserted these heuristically\n[23, 24, 25]. Another theory of melting is based on a Landau expansion in a symmetric tensor order parameter of\nrank four [26]. This theory is purely phenomenological\nand thus only descriptive, not predictive.\nFor a proper description for the melting transition, it\nseems necessary to incorporate information of the lattice structure and the associated crystal defects into the\ntheory. About 15 years ago, one of the authors (HK)\ndid this successfully by constructing lattice models of\nthe melting transition [3, 4]. The important progress\nof these models [27] was that they started out from the\nlattice version of the elastic lattice energy which allow for\nthe thermal creation and annihilation of dislocations and\ndisclinations and keeps track of their lattice elastic energy [27]. They are included by means of discrete-valued\ndefect gauge fields, the disclinations being essential for\nexplaining the first-order nature of transition [28], which\notherwise would be of second order, as in the vortex-line\ninduced \u03bb-transition of superfluid helium.\nIn this respect, the older models went beyond those of\nmore recent authors [24, 29] who considered only the proliferation of dislocation lines which, if properly treated,\nwould have produced only second-order phase transitions\n[30], thus being unable to describe the melting transition.\nA simple universal melting formula was obtained from\n\n\f2\nthe above lattice defect models in a lowest-order approximation which combines the properties of the hightemperature expansion of the defect contributions with\nthe low-temperature expansion of the free energy density.\nFrom the intersection of these two curves, one can obtain\na formula for the melting temperature in accordance with\nLindemann's rule, but with a prediction of the absolute\nsize of the Lindemann number [3].\nThis successful theory has, however, one important\ndrawback: For simplicity, it was constructed only for\nthe physically somewhat exotic case of simple cubic lattices. This makes it strictly applicable only to very few\nmaterials-there are almost no simple cubic lattices in\nnature. If the derived formulas are applied to other cubic crystal structures such as body center cubic (bcc)\nlattices and face center cubic (fcc) lattices, the accuracy\nmust necessarily be bad. Hence there is an obvious need\nto generalize the theory to physically more prolific crystal\nstructures.\nThe purpose of this letter is to present such a generalization of the melting model to fcc and bcc lattices.\nWhen generalizing the previous melting model to other\ncubic lattices, We shall see in the high-temperature limit,\nthat for all cubic crystals the free energy density is only\nrelated to the elastic constants of the crystals and does\nnot depend on the lattice structure of the system. This\nis in contrast to the low-temperature limit, where the\nfree energy density involves integrals over the lattice momenta Ki and K i which strongly depend on the detailed\nlattice structure of the crystals. It is therefore important\nto give a proper description of the low-temperature limit\nof the free energy density for different lattice structures.\nThe lattice model for the cubic crystals will be based\non the elastic energy\n\uf8f1\n\u00032\na3 X \uf8f2 1 X \u0002\nA\nE =\n\u2207(l) u(m) + \u2207(m) u(l)\n\uf8f3\nn\n4\nx\nl6=m\n\n\"\n#2\uf8fc\n\u0010\n\u00032 B X\na\u0011 \uf8fd\n\u2207(l) u(l) ~x \u2212~e(l)\n\u2207(l) u(l) +\n+ C\n2A\n2 \uf8fe\nl\nl\n\"\nX 1\nX\na3\n\u2207(m) \u2207(m)\n= \u2212 A\nui (x) ei(l) ej(l)\nn\n2\nm\nX\u0002\n\nx,i,j,l,n\n\n+ 2(C \u2212 1)ei(l) ej(l) \u2207(l) \u2207(l)\n#\n\u0012\n\u0013\nB\nj\n+\n+ 1 ei(l) \u2207(l) \u2207(n) e(n) uj (x), (1)\nA\n\nFor fcc lattices, there are six link vectors:\n~e(1) = (1, 1, 0),\n\n~e(2) = (1, 0, 1),\n\n~e(3) = (0, 1, 1)\n\n~e(4) = (1, \u22121, 0), ~e(5) = (0, 1, \u22121), ~e(6) = (\u22121, 0, 1), (2)\neach lattice site x having twelve nearest neighbors at x \u00b1\n~e(l) a/2.

It is therefore suggestive to use these small deviations for defining\nthe displacement field. But this definition can be consistent only for a small time span. Due to fluctuations,\nthermals as well as quantum, the atoms are capable of\nexchanging positions with their neighbors and migrate,\nafter a sufficiently long time, through the entire crystal.\nThis process of self-diffusion makes it impossible to specify the displacement field uniquely. Thus, as a matter of\nprinciple, the displacement field is undetermined up to an\narbitrary lattice vector, it is impossible to say whether\nan atom is displaced by u(l) (x) or by\nu(l) (~x) + bN(l) (~x)\n\nwhere n is the number of atoms per unit cell, ~e(l) are\noriented link vectors of cubic lattice pointing from any\nlattice site to its nearest neighbors along the positive direction, and ui denote the Cartesian displacement field,\nu(l) = ui ei(l) their components along the link directions.\n\nwhere N(l) (~x) is the jumping field with integer value.\nBecause of this, we should introduce an extra sum over\nan integer-valued field n(lm) (x) with a gauge fixing term\n\u03a6[n(lm) ] in the corresponding partition function, thus the\n\n\f3\npartition function of the defect melting model reads\nX Y \u0014Z dui (x) \u0015\nZ =\n\u03a6[n(lm) ]\na\nn(lm) x,i\n\"\n(\na3 A X 1 X \u0010\n\u2207(l) u(m) + \u2207(m) u(l)\n\u00d7 exp \u2212\nnkB T x 2\nl<m\n\u00112\nX\n\u00012\n\u2212b(n(lm) + n(ml) ) + C\n\u2207(l) u(l) \u2212 bn(ll)\nl\n\na\nB \u0010 X\u0002\n\u2207(l) u(l) (~x \u2212 ~e(l) )\n+\n2A\n2\nl\n#)\na \u0003\u00112\n\u2212bn(ll) (~x \u2212 ~e(l) )\n2\n\n(7)\n\nThe partition function is invariant under the following\ndefect gauge transformations\nu(l) \u2192 u(l) (x) + bN(l) (x), n(lm) \u2192 n(lm) + \u2207(l) N(m) (x).\nThis partition function can be expressed in terms of the\nstress field \u03c3ij by\n\u0012\n\u0013\u0015\u2212N/2 \u0012\n\u00133N Y \u0014Z\n\u0014\n\u0015\n3\u03bb\n1\nZ = 8\u03be 3 1+\nd\u03c3ij\n2\u03bc\u03be\n2\u03c0\u03b2\nx,i\u2264j\n\"\n(\n\u0014Z\n\u0015\nX\nY\ndui (x)\n\u22121 X X 2\n\u00d7\n\u03c3\n\u03a6[n(lm) ]\nexp\na\n2\u03b2 x i<j ij\nn(lm)\nx,i\n#)\n\u0010 X \u00112\n\u03bb\n1 X 2\n\u03c3ii\n\u03c3 \u2212\n+\n2\u03be i ii 4\u03bc\u03be 2 + 6\u03bb\u03be\ni\n\"\n#\n\u0010\n\u0011\nX\n\u00d7 exp i\u03c0\n\u03c3(lm) \u2207(l)u(m) +\u2207(m)u(l) \u2212 2bn(lm) , (8)\nx,l,m\n\n\u221a\nwhere \u03c3(lm) = ( 3/16)ei(l) ej(m) \u03c3ij for bcc lattice and\n\u221a\n\u03c3(lm) = ( 2/16)ei(l) ej(m) \u03c3ij for fcc lattice, and \u03b2 =\n(a3 \u03bc)/(nkB T (2\u03c0)2 ). In the calculation process from (7)\nto (8), the corresponding expressions of A, B, C and ei(l)\nare used. In spite of the tedious intermediate calculation,\nthe prefactors in the partition functions (8) are the same\nfor all cubic lattices.\nFor the-lowest order approximation, we need only to\ninvestigate the system in low-temperature and hightemperature limits. It has been shown in the textbook\n[3] (see Fig. 12.1 on p. 1084) that the intersection of\nthe free energies of the two limiting curves yields good\nestimates for the melting temperatures in simple-cubic\nlattices.\nFor T \u2192 0, the defect configuration is completely\nfrozen out, and the partition function has a classical\nlimit. From the lattice energy (1) we obtain the classical partition function of cubic lattice\nr\n3N\nY \u0014Z dui (x) \u0015\n2\u03c0nkB T \u2212N 12 l\n\u2212E/kB T\ne\n=\n,\ne\nZcl =\na\nAa3\nx,i\n\nwhere the dimensionless parameter l is defined by the\ntrace log\n\nl=\n\n2\u03c0/a\nZ\n\nd3 ka3\ntr log M,\n(4\u03c0)3\n\n(9)\n\n\u22122\u03c0/a\n\nand M denotes the matrix\nX\nX\nMij = 4\u03b4ij a2 K (m) K(m)+2(C \u22121)a2 ei(l) K(l) K (l) ej(l)\nm\n\nl\n\n\u0013 X\n\u0012\nB\n+1 a2\nei(l) K(l) K (n) ej(n)\n+\nA\n\n(10)\n\nl,n\n\nand K(l) and K (l) are lattice momenta, for fcc\nK(l) =\n\n\u221a\n\u221a\na\n2 i~k*~e(l) a2\n2\n~\n\u2212 1), K (l) =\n(e\n(1 \u2212 e\u2212ik*~e(l) 2 ),(11)\nai\nai\n\nand for bcc\na\na\n2i\n2i\n~\n~\nK(l) = \u221a (1\u2212eik*~e(l) 2 ), K (l) = \u221a (e\u2212ik*~e(l) 2 \u22121).(12)\n3a\n3a\n\nThus we find the free energy density of the fcc and bcc\nlattices in the low-temperature limit\n\u0012\n\u0013\n2\u03c0nkB T\nf T \u21920\n3\n\u03bc\n1\n3\n\u2212\n= log\n+ log \u2212 l.

Moreover, from\nour expression, one can recognize clearly that the melting\ntemperature will be zero when the anisotropic parameter\n\u03be equals to zero, this is in contrast to recent phenomenological theories of melting by other authors [24]. The\nnovelty of this formula with respect to a similar formula\nin Ref. [3] [see Eq. (12.13) on p. 1079] lies in a determination of trace log term l for bcc and fcc lattices. The\nresulting melting temperatures from Eq. (15) are shown\nin Table 1, where they are compared with experimental\nnumbers and with the results found from Lindemann's\n\n\f4\nrule where the Lindemann number is initially undetermined and must be extracted from the average over all\nmaterials. Our lowest-order theory has an average precision of about 12%, which is better by a factor 2 than the\n22% of the numbers from derived Lindemann's rule.\nElement\n\u03bc\n\u03bb\n\u03be\nTm,theor.

This was done in Ref. [3] for the unphysical\nsimple cubic lattices, and will be done for bcc and fcc\nlattices in future work.\nOne of the author (Y.J.) gratefully acknowledges the\nfinancial support from Alexander von Humboldt Foundation.\n\n\u2217\n\nElectronic address: kleinert@physik.fu-berlin.de\nElectronic address: jiang@physik.fu-berlin.de\n[1] W.
