MECKES\nAbstract. We discuss transportation cost inequalities for uniform measures on convex\nbodies, and connections with other geometric and functional inequalities. In particular, we\nshow how transportation inequalities can be applied to the slicing problem, and prove a new\nlog-Sobolev-type inequality for bounded domains in Rn .\n\n1. Introduction\nWe work in Rn equipped with its standard inner product h*, *i and Euclidean norm | * |.\n|A| also denotes the volume (Lebesgue measure) of a measurable set A. Dn is the Euclidean\nball of volume one. For a measurable set A with 0 < |A| < \u221e, mA denotes the uniform\nprobability measure on A, that is, mA (B) = |A\u2229B|\n. The symbols \u03bc and \u03bd will always stand\n|A|\nn\nfor Borel probability measures on R .\nWe first introduce two different ways to quantify the difference between two probability\nmeasures. First, for p \u2265 1, the (Lp ) Wasserstein distance between \u03bc and \u03bd is\n\u0012Z\n\u00131/p\np\n|x \u2212 y| d\u03c0(x, y)\nWp (\u03bc, \u03bd) = inf\n,\n\u03c0\n\nwhere \u03c0 runs over probability measures on Rn \u00d7 Rn with marginals \u03bc and \u03bd. We will be\ninterested mainly in the special cases p = 1, 2. Second, if \u03bd \u226a \u03bc, the relative entropy of \u03bd\nwith respect to \u03bc is\n\u0012 \u0013\nZ\nd\u03bd\nd\u03bd.\nH(\u03bd|\u03bc) = log\nd\u03bc\nThe (Lp ) transportation cost constant \u03c4p (\u03bc) is the largest constant \u03c4 such that\nr\n2\n(1)\nWp (\u03bc, \u03bd) \u2264\nH(\u03bd|\u03bc)\n\u03c4\nfor every \u03bd \u226a \u03bc. An inequality of the form of (1) is referred to as a transportation cost\ninequality for \u03bc. Note that if p \u2264 q, then Wp \u2264 Wq by H\u00f6lder's inequality, and hence\n\u03c4p (\u03bc) \u2265 \u03c4q (\u03bc).\nTransportation cost inequalities are by now well known as a method to derive measure\nconcentration (cf. [8, Chapter 6]). In fact, as follows from Bobkov and G\u00f6tze's dual characterization of the L1 transportation cost inequality [3], \u03c41 (\u03bc) is equivalent to the best constant\n\u03b1 in the normal concentration inequality:\n2\n\n\u03bc({x \u2208 Rn : |F (x)| \u2265 t}) \u2264 2e\u2212\u03b1t for t > 0\nR\nfor all 1-Lipschitz functions F with F d\u03bc = 0.\n\n(2)\n\n1\n\n\f2\n\nM. MECKES\n\nIn this paper we consider transportation cost inequalities for uniform measures on convex\nbodies. In the next section we show that such inequalities can be applied to the slicing\nproblem. In the last section we discuss their relationship with Sobolev-type functional inequalities, and present a logarithmic Sobolev inequality with trace for bounded domains in\nRn .\n2. Relation to the slicing problem\nWe recall the following definitions and facts about isotropic convex bodies (see [10]). A\nconvex body K is called isotropic if\n(1) its centroid is 0,\n(2) |K| = 1, and\n(3) there is a constant LK > 0 such that\nZ\nhx, yi2 dx = L2K |y|2\nK\n\nn\n\nfor all y \u2208 R .\nEvery convex body K has an affine image T (K) (unique up to orthogonal transformations)\nwhich is isotropic; the isotropic constant of K is defined as LK = LT (K) . The isotropic\nconstant also has the extremal characterization\n\u0012\n\u00131/2\nZ\n1\n2\n(3)\nLK = min\n|x| dx\n,\nT\nn|K|1+2/n T (K)\n\nwhere T runs over volume-preserving affine transformations of Rn , with equality iff K is\nisotropic. The slicing problem for convex bodies asks whether there is a universal constant\nc such that LK \u2264 c for all convex bodies K; see [10] for extensive discussion and alternate\nformulations.\nIf K, B \u2282 Rn are convex bodies, the volume ratio of K in B is\n\u00131/n\n\u0012\n|B|\n,\nvr(B, K) = min\nT\n|T (K)|\n\nwhere T runs over affine transformations of Rn such that T (K) \u2282 B. The following lemma\nindicates the relevance of transportation cost inequalities to the slicing problem.\nLemma 1. Let K, B \u2282 Rn be convex bodies, with B isotropic. Then\np\n\u0001\nLK \u2264 c 1 + log v v \u03c4 \u22121/2 ,\nwhere \u03c4 = \u03c41 (B), v = vr(B, K), and c is an absolute constant.\n\nProof. We may assume that K \u2282 B and |K| = v \u2212n . If \u03b40 denotes the point mass at 0 \u2208 Rn ,\nthen by the triangle inequality for W1 ,\nZ\n1\n|x| dx = W1 (mK , \u03b40 ) \u2264 W1 (mK , mB ) + W1 (mB , \u03b40 )\n|K| K\nr\nZ\n2\n\u2264\nH(mK |mB ) +\n|x| dx\n\u03c4\nB\n\n\fTRANSPORTATION INEQUALITIES\n\n\u2264\n\ns\n\n=\n\nr\n\n1\n2\nlog\n+\n\u03c4\n|K|\n\n\u0012Z\n\n3\n\n\u00131/2\n|x| dx\n2\n\nB\n\n\u221a\n2n\nlog v + nLB .\n\u03c4\n\nNow by applying (2) to a linear functional, LB \u2264 c \u03c4 \u22121/2 . On the other hand, by Borell's\nlemma (see e.g. [8, Section 2.2]), there is an absolute constant c such that\n\u00131/2\n\u0012\nZ\nZ\n1\n1\n2\n|x| dx\n|x| dx.\n\u2264c\n|K| K\n|K| K\nThe claim now follows from the extremal characterization of LK (3).\n\n\u0003\n\nAn analogous estimate with \u03c4 = \u03c42 (B) can be proved more directly, without Borell's\nlemma.\nIn light of the equivalence of L1 transportation cost inequalities and normal concentration, Lemma 1 can also be thought of as an application of measure concentration to the\nslicing problem. Since the Euclidean ball is well known to have normal concentration, as an\nimmediate corollary we obtain the following known fact.\nCorollary 2. If vr(Dn , K) \u2264 c, then LK \u2264 c\u2032 , where c\u2032 depends only on c.\nRecently, Klartag [7] introduced the following isomorphic version of the slicing problem:\ngiven a convex body K, is there a convex body B such that LB \u2264 c1 and d(B, K) \u2264 c2 , where\nd is Banach-Mazur distance? In the case that K and B are centrally symmetric, Klartag\nsolved this problem in the affirmative, up to a logarithmic (in n) factor in c2 . Lemma 1\nsuggests approaching the slicing problem via a modified version of the isomorphic problem:\ngiven a convex body K, can one find a \"similar\" body B such that \u03c41 (B) is large when B\nis in isotropic position? Notice that while Klartag's result uses Banach-Mazur distance to\nquantify \"similarity\" of bodies, in Lemma 1 it is the weaker measure of volume ratio which is\nrelevant. It also seems that this approach via transportation cost is less sensitive to central\nsymmetry than more traditional methods of asymptotic convexity.\nFinally, we remark that the real point of the proof of Lemma 1 is that moments of the\nEuclidean norm on convex bodies, thought of as functionals of the bodies, are Lipschitz with\nrespect to Wasserstein distances on uniform measures. This suggests an alternative approach\nto the slicing problem, related to the one discussed above, of directly studying optimal\n(or near-optimal) probability measures \u03c0 in the definition of Wp (mK , mB ) for p = 1, 2.\nParticularly in the case p = 2 a great deal is known about the optimal \u03c0; see [12] for an\nexcellent survey.\n3. Functional inequalities\nThe entropy of f : Rn \u2192 R+ with respect to \u03bc is\n\u0012\n\u0013\nZ\nf\nEnt\u03bc (f ) = f log R\nd\u03bc,\nf d\u03bc\n\n\f4\n\nM. MECKES\n\nand the variance of f : Rn \u2192 R with respect to \u03bc is\n\u0012Z\n\u00132\nZ\n2\nVar\u03bc (f ) = f d\u03bc \u2212\nf d\u03bc .\nThe logarithmic Sobolev constant \u03c1(\u03bc) is the largest constant \u03c1 such that\nZ\n2\n2\n|\u2207f |2 d\u03bc\n(4)\nEnt\u03bc (f ) \u2264\n\u03c1\n\nfor all smooth f \u2208 L2 (\u03bc). The spectral gap \u03bb(\u03bc) is the largest constant \u03bb such that\nZ\n1\n(5)\nVar\u03bc (f ) \u2264\n|\u2207f |2 d\u03bc\n\u03bb\n\nfor all smooth f \u2208 L2 (\u03bc). It is well known (cf. [8]) that a logarithmic Sobolev inequality for\n\u03bc implies normal concentration (and hence an L1 transportation cost inequality, by Bobkov\nand G\u00f6tze's result [3]) and a spectral gap inequality implies exponential concentration. A\nresult of Otto and Villani [11] shows further that\n\u03c1(\u03bc) \u2264 \u03c42 (\u03bc) \u2264 \u03bb(\u03bc)\n\nfor any absolutely continuous \u03bc. Thus transportation cost inequalities are somehow intermediate between these Sobolev-type functional inequalities, and it is of interest here to consider\nwhat is known about \u03c1(K) and \u03bb(K) for a convex body K. We briefly review known results.\nKannan, Lov\u00e1sz, and Simonovits [6] showed that\n\u0013\u22121\n\u0012\nZ\n1\n2\n|x \u2212 z| dx\n,\n\u03bb(K) \u2265 c\n|K| K\n\nwhere z is the centroid of K. It is easy to see that this is an optimal estimate in general.\nBy testing (5) on linear functionals, one can see that \u03bb(\u03bc) \u2264 \u03b11\u22121 for any \u03bc, where \u03b11 is the\nlargest eigenvalue of the covariance matrix of \u03bc. If \u03b11 is much\nR 2 larger than the remaining\neigenvalues (i.e., \u03bc is close to being one-dimensional), then |x| d\u03bc(x) \u2248 \u03b11 . However, this\nsituation is far from isotropicity (in which all the eigenvalues are equal), and the authors of\n[6] conjecture that when K is isotropic,\n\u0012Z\n\u0013\u22121\nc\n2\n(6)\n\u03bb(K) \u2265 cn\n|x| dx\n= 2 .\nLK\nK\nBobkov [2] estimated \u03c1(K) in terms of the L\u03c82 (mK ) norm of | * |; in the case that K is\nisotropic, this can be combined with a result of Alesker [1] to yield\nc\n(7)\n\u03c1(K) \u2265\n.\nnL2K\nThe estimate for \u03c41 (K) which follows from (7) also follows by combining Alesker's result\nwith an L1 transportation cost inequality proved recently by Bolley and Villani [5] in an\nextremely general setting. The estimate (7) misses the level of (6) by a factor of n, but in\nthis case the estimate cannot be sharpened even when K is isotropic: if K is taken to be\nthe ln1 unit ball, renormalized to have volume one, then exponential concentration correctly\n\n\fTRANSPORTATION INEQUALITIES\n\n5\n\ndescribes the behavior of a linear functional in a coordinate direction; it can in fact be shown\nthat \u03c41 (K) \u2248 n1 in this case. However, in two concrete cases we have best possible estimates:\n\u03c1(Qn ) \u2265 c and \u03c1(Dn ) \u2265 c,\n\nwhere Qn is a cube of volume 1. The estimate for Qn is probably folklore; the estimate for\nDn is due to Bobkov and Ledoux [4].\nFinally, we present the following \"doubly homogeneous Lp trace logarithmic Sobolev inequality\" for uniform measures on bounded domains, inspired both by the search for good\nestimates on \u03c1(K) for isotropic K, and by the recent work [9] by Maggi and Villani on trace\nSobolev inequalities. This seems not to be directly comparable to the classical logarithmic Sobolev inequality (4), but interestingly is completely insensitive to isotropicity or even\np\nconvexity of the domain.

Therefore if one restricts the logarithmic Sobolev\ninequality (4) for \u03bc = m\u03a9 to functions which vanish on the boundary of \u03a9, one can improve\n2/n\nthe constant \u03c1 to 2(n + 2)\u03c9n |\u03a9|\u22122/n , which is always stronger by at least a factor of 2 than\nthe best possible result for general f , and much stronger still in many cases.\n\nProof of Proposition 3. The proof is based on the results of Brenier and McCann on mass\ntransportation via a convex gradient; we refer to [12] for details and references. To begin,\nwe assume that p > 1; the case p = 1 follows the same lines and is slightly simpler. We also\nassume that f is smooth and nonnegative,\nZ\n1\nf p = 1,\n|\u03a9| \u03a9\nand\n\n|\u03a9| =\n\n\u0012\n\nn+q\np\u22121\n\n\u0013n/q\n\n\u03c9n .\n\n\f6\n\nM. MECKES\n\nWe will use the fact that there is a convex function \u03c6 such that \u2207\u03c6 (the Brenier map)\ntransports the probability measure f p dm\u03a9 to the probability measure mBR , where BR =\n|\u03a9|1/n Dn is the Euclidean ball normalized so that |BR | = |\u03a9|.\nBy the results of McCann, the Monge-Amp\u00e8re equation\nf p (x) = det HA \u03c6(x)\nis satisfied f p dm\u03a9 -a.e., where HA \u03c6 is the Aleksandrov Hessian of \u03c6 (i.e., the absolutely\ncontinuous part of the distributional Hessian H\u03c6). Using the fact that \u03c6 is convex and\nlog t \u2264 t \u2212 1 for t > 0,\nlog f p (x) = log det HA \u03c6(x) \u2264 \u2206A \u03c6(x) \u2212 n,\n\nwhere \u2206A \u03c6 is the Aleksandrov Laplacian of \u03c6 (i.e., the trace of HA \u03c6).
