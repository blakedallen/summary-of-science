Introduction\nThe theory of branching random walks (BRWs from now on) has a long history dating back to\nthe earlier works on discrete-time branching processes (see [10] for the original work of Galton and\nWatson and [1, 13]). In the last 20 years much effort has been put in the study of continuoustime BRWs (see [15, 17, 18, 21, 22] just to name a few). Among all the topics which have been\nstudied there is the distinction between local and global survival (see for instance [24, 26, 2, 3]) and\nthe relation between multitype contact processes and BRWs (see [4]); besides, some papers have\nexplored the subject of continuous-time BRWs on random environments (see for instance [12]).\nDiscrete-time BRWs have been studied initially as a natural generalization of branching processes\n(see [1, 5, 6, 7, 8, 13] just to mention a few). In recent years there has been a growing interest on\ndiscrete-time BRWs on deterministic graphs and on random environments (see [9, 11, 14, 19, 20,\n23]). It is well-known that any continuous-time BRW admits a discrete-time counterpart with the\nsame behavior (see Section 2.2), thus, under a certain point of view, discrete-time BRWs generalize\ncontinuous-time BRWs; this is the analogous of the construction of the jump chain associated to\na continuous-time Markov chain. Hence discrete-time BRWs help to understand continuous-time\nprocesses as well (see for instance [2, 3]).\nThere are many reasons for studying fairly simple and non-interacting models such as BRWs.\nOne of them is the well-known connection with percolation theory. Besides, they are fundamental\ntools in the journey to understanding more sophisticated models: for instance, they are frequently\nused as comparison to prove survival or extinction of different particle systems using the well-known\n1\n\n\ftechnique called coupling. This last reason justifies our choice of studying truncated BRWs (see\nSections 3.3 and 6).\nOne of the differences between the discrete-time and the continuous-time settings is that in the\nsecond one the Markov property identifies a unique family of distributions for the time intervals\nbetween births and deaths and thus a unique family of laws for the random number of children of\neach particle. Hence, even if a continuous-time process seems to be a more realistic picture in view\nof applications, on the other hand it appears as a strong restriction if compared to the wide choice\nof reproduction laws that one can consider in the discrete-time case. Moreover, it is customary in\nthe continuous-time setting, to study a one-parameter family of BRWs simultaneously in order to\ncompute the intervals corresponding to different behaviors (see Section 2.2 for details). In contrast,\nthe main results for discrete-time BRWs deal with one single process; nevertheless this is not a\nserious restriction and it is easy to see that the results on survival which are known for continuoustime BRWs can be obtained by applying the results for discrete-time BRWs to their discrete-time\ncounterparts. In this sense the results of this paper \"generalize\" those of [2, 3]; we give more details\nin the outline of the paper below. We study the survival of a BRW in the first part of this paper.\nAs for the topic of the second part, namely the approximation of a BRW, we see that, while the\nresults on the spatial approximation (see Section 5) generalize those of [4, Section 3], the results\nabout the approximation by truncated BRWs (see Section 6) cannot be seen as a generalization of\nthe analogous results of [4, Section 5]. This is due to the fact that the discrete-time counterpart of\na continuous-time truncated BRW is not a discrete-time truncated BRW. Indeed note that in the\ndefinition of a truncated BRW (see Section 3.3 and [4, Section 2]) the time scale is essential.\nThe aim of this paper is threefold: we want to study the global, local and strong local behavior of\ndiscrete-time BRWs, the possibility of approximating BRW with a sequence of \"spatially confined\"\nand stochastically dominated BRWs and, finally, the approximation of a BRW by means of a\nsequence of truncated BRWs which are, essentially, multitype contact processes. The results of this\npaper generalize those of [2, 3, 4] not only because the class of discrete-time BRWs extends the\nclass of continuous-time BRWs but also since some of the theorems are stronger and require weaker\nhypotheses.\nHere is the outline of the paper. In Section 2 we define discrete-time BRWs and discuss their\nmain properties. This is a natural generalization of the class of multitype Galton\u2013Watson branching\nprocess (see [13, Section II.2]) similar to those introduced in other papers (see [2, 3, 11, 23] for some\nrecent references). In Section 2.2 we briefly introduce continuous-time BRWs and we construct\ntheir discrete-time counterparts. In Section 3 we give the technical definitions and we state some\nbasic results. Section 4.1 is devoted to the study of local and global survival. The main result\n(Theorem 4.1) characterizes local survival by means of the first-moment matrix M of the process\n(see Section 2.1), and global survival using a possibly infinite-dimensional generating function\nassociated to the BRW. This theorem generalizes [3, Theorems 4.1, 4.3 and 4.7]. An independent\n2\n\n\fproof of Theorem 4.1(1) appeared in [23, Theorem 2.4]. A similar, but weaker, result for a limited\nclass of continuous-time BRWs can be found in [24] and, for the whole class of continuous-time\nBRWs, in [2, 3]. We show that, in general, global survival cannot be characterized in terms of the\nfirst-moment matrix alone (see Example 4.4), nevertheless some functional inequalities involving\nonly the first-moment matrix M must hold in case of global survival (see Theorem 4.1). We\nintroduce a class of fairly regular BRWs, which includes BRWs on quasi-transitive graphs and BRWs\non regular graphs, for which we can give a complete characterization of global survival in terms\nof the matrix M . Roughly speaking, the regularity that we require is the possibility of mapping\nthese BRWs into multitype Galton\u2013Watson processes for which a complete characterization of the\nglobal survival is known (see for instance [13] and Theorem 4.1(5)). In Section 4.2 we show that\nlocal survival can be described, as the global one, by means of an infinite-dimensional generating\nfunction; this is the key to discuss strong local survival. This kind of survival was already studied,\nfor instance, in [11] for a BRW on a random environment on Z. Here, using a different technique,\nwe are able to treat a large class of transitive BRWs on deterministic graphs. In Section 5 we first\ngeneralize a Theorem due to Sarymshakov and Seneta (see [25, Theorem 6.8]) and then we use\nthis result (Theorem 5.1) to obtain an approximation of a general BRW, which is not necessarily\nirreducible, by means of a sequence of spatially confined BRWs (Theorem 5.2); this last one is a\ngeneralization of [4, Theorem 3.1]. Here we obtain, as a particular case, that if we have a surviving\nprocess, then by confining it to a sufficiently large (possibly finite and not necessarily connected)\nproper subgraph the resulting BRW survives as well; this result was already known for irreducible\nBRWs confined to connected subgraphs. At the end of the section we give some examples and\ncounterexamples. Section 6 deals with the approximation of the BRW with a sequence of truncated\nBRWs. The key to obtain such a result is the comparison of our process with a suitable oriented\npercolation (as explained in Section 6.1). The strategy is then applied to some classes of regular\nBRWs in Theorem 6.5 (concerning local behavior) and Theorem 6.7 (concerning global behavior).\nFinally in Section 7 we briefly discuss some open questions and possible future developments.\n2. The dynamics: discrete and continuous time\n2.1. Discrete-time branching random walks. We start with the construction of a generic\ndiscrete-time BRW (see also [3] where it is called infinite-type branching process) on a set X which\nis at most countable. To this aim we consider a general family \u03bc = {\u03bcx }x\u2208X of probability measures\nP\non SX := {f : X \u2192 N : y f (y) < \u221e}. The updating rule is the following: a particle at a site\n\nx \u2208 X lives one unit of time, then, with probability \u03bcx , a function f \u2208 SX is chosen and the\noriginal particle is replaced by f (y) particles at y, for all y \u2208 X; this is done independently for all\n\nthe particles.\n\nHere is another equivalent dynamics: define the function H : SX \u2192 N as H(f ) :=\n\nand denote by \u03c1x the measure on N defined by \u03c1x (*) := \u03bcx\n3\n\n(H \u22121 (*));\n\nP\n\nx\u2208X\n\nf (x)\n\nthis is the law of the random\n\n\fnumber of children of every particle living at x. For each particle, independently, we pick a number\nn at random, according to the law \u03c1x , and then we choose a function f \u2208 H \u22121 (n) with probability\nP\n\u03bcx (f )/\u03c1x (n) \u2261 \u03bcx (f )/ g\u2208H \u22121 (n) \u03bcx (g) and, again, we replace the particle at x with f (y) particles\nat y (for all y \u2208 X).\n\nMore precisely, given a family {fi,n,x }i,n\u2208N,x\u2208X of independent SX -valued random variable such\n\nthat, for every x \u2208 X, {fi,n,x }i,n\u2208N have the common law \u03bcx , then the discrete-time BRW {\u03b7n }n\u2208N\nis defined iteratively as follow\n\u03b7n+1 (x) =\n\nn (y)\nX \u03b7X\n\nfi,n,y (x) =\n\n\u221e\nXX\n\n1l{\u03b7n (y)=j}\n\ny\u2208X j=0\n\ny\u2208X i=1\n\nj\nX\n\nfi,n,y (x)\n\n(2.1)\n\ni=1\n\nstarting from an initial condition \u03b70 . We denote the BRW by (X, \u03bc); the initial value will be clearly\nindicated each time.\nDenote by mxy :=\n\nP\n\nf \u2208SX\n\nf (y)\u03bcx (f ) the expected number of particles from x to y (that is,\n\nthe expected number of children that a particle living at x can send to y) and suppose that\nP\nsupx\u2208X y\u2208X mxy < +\u221e; most of the results of this paper still hold without this hypothesis,\nnevertheless it allows us to avoid dealing with an infinite expected number of offsprings. Note that\nP\nP\ny\u2208X mxy =\nn\u22650 n\u03c1x (n) =: \u03c1\u0304x .\n(n)\n\nWe denote by M = (mxy )x,y\u2208X the first-moment matrix and by mxy the entries of the matrix\n\nM n . We call diffusion matrix the matrix P with entries p(x, y) = mxy /\u03c1\u0304x .\nFrom equation (2.1), it is straightforward to prove that the expected number of particles, starting\nfrom an initial condition \u03b70 , satisfies the recurrence equation E\u03b70 (\u03b7n+1 (x)) = (E\u03b70 (\u03b7n )M )(x) =\nP\n\u03b70\ny\u2208X myx E (\u03b7n (y)) hence\nX\nE\u03b70 (\u03b7n (x)) =\nm(n)\n(2.2)\nyx \u03b70 (y).\ny\u2208X\n\nMoreover, the family of probability measures, {\u03bcx }x induces in a natural way a graph structure\n\non X that we denote by (X, E\u03bc ) where E\u03bc := {(x, y) : mxy > 0} \u2261 {(x, y) : \u2203f \u2208 SX , \u03bcx (f ) >\n\n0, f (y) > 0}. Roughly speaking, (x, y) is and edge if and only if a particle living at x can send a\n\nchild at y with positive probability (from now on wpp). We say that there is a path from x to y,\nand we write x \u2192 y, if it is possible to find a finite sequence {xi }ni=0 such that x0 = x, xn = y and\n\n(xi , xi+1 ) \u2208 E\u03bc for all i = 0, . . . , n \u2212 1. If x \u2192 y and y \u2192 x we write x \u21cb y.\n\nRecall that the matrix M = (mxy )x,y\u2208X is said to be irreducible if and only if the graph (X, E\u03bc )\n\nis connected, otherwise we call it reducible. We denote by deg(x) the degree of a vertex x, that is,\nthe cardinality of the set {y \u2208 X : (x, y) \u2208 E\u03bc }.\n\nThe colony can survive in different ways: we say that the colony survives locally wpp at y \u2208 X\n\nstarting from x \u2208 X if\n\nP\u03b4x (lim sup \u03b7n (y) > 0) > 0;\nn\u2192\u221e\n\n4\n\n\fwe say that it survives globally wpp starting from x if\n\u0011\n\u0010X\n\u03b7n (w) > 0, \u2200n \u2208 N > 0.\nP\u03b4x\nw\u2208X\n\nMoreover, following [11], we say that the there is strong local survival wpp at y \u2208 X starting from\n\nx \u2208 X if\n\nP\u03b4x (lim sup \u03b7n (y) > 0) = P\u03b4x\nn\u2192\u221e\n\n\u0010X\n\nw\u2208X\n\n\u0011\n\u03b7n (w) > 0, \u2200n \u2208 N > 0.\n\nFrom now on when we talk about survival, \"wpp\" will be tacitly understood. Often we will say\nsimply that local survival occurs \"starting from x\" or \"at x\": in this case we mean that x = y.\nClearly local survival implies global survival and, if x \u2192 y then local survival at x implies local\n\nsurvival at y starting from x. Analogously, if x \u2192 y then global survival starting from y implies\nglobal survival starting from x. Moreover if x \u21cb y then local (resp. global) survival starting from\n\nx is equivalent to local (resp. global) survival starting from y. In particular, if M is irreducible\nthen the process survives locally (resp. globally) at one vertex if and only if it survives locally\n(resp. globally) at every vertex.\nAssumption 2.1. We assume henceforth that for all x \u2208 X there is a vertex y \u21cb x such that\nP\n\u03bcy (f : w\u21cby f (w) = 1) < 1, that is, in every equivalence class (with respect to \u21cb) there is at least\n\none vertex where a particle can have a number of children different from one wpp.\n\nRemark 2.2. The previous assumption guarantees that the restriction of the BRW to an equivalence\nclass is nonsingular (see [13, Definition II.6.2]). There is a technical reason behind the previous\nassumption: if we consider the classical Galton\u2013Watson branching process, that is, X := {x} is a\nsingleton and \u03bcx can be considered as a probability measure on N, then it is well-known that\n\u2022 if \u03bcx (1) = 1 then mxx = 1 and there is survival with probability 1;\n\u2022 if \u03bcx (1) < 1 then there is survival wpp if and only if mxx > 1.\n\nHence the condition mxx > 1 is equivalent to survival under Assumption 2.1. This will be used\nimplicitly in Theorem 4.1(1) and (5) (but it is not needed, for instance, in Theorem 4.1(2), (3) and\n(4)).\nA particular, but meaningful, subclass of discrete-time BRWs is described by the following\nupdating rule: a particle at site x lives one unit of time and is replaced by a random number of\nchildren, with law \u03c1x . The children are dispersed independently on the sites of the graph, according\nto a stochastic matrix P . Note that this rule is a particular case of the general one, since here one\nsimply chooses\n\u03bcx (f ) = \u03c1x\n\nX\ny\n\n!P\n\nf (y)\n\nf (y)! Y\n(p(x, y))f (y) ,\nf\n(y)!\ny\ny\n\nQy\n\n\u2200f \u2208 SX .\n\nClearly in this case the expected number of children at y of a particle living at x is\n5\n\n(2.3)\n\n\fmxy = p(x, y)\u03c1\u0304x .\n\n(2.4)\n\n2.2. Continuous-time branching random walks. Continuous-time BRWs have been studied\nextensively by many authors; in this section we make use of a natural correspondence between\ncontinuous-time BRWs and discrete-time BRWs which preserves both local and global behaviors.\nIn continuous time each particle has an exponentially distributed random lifetime with parameter\n1. The breeding mechanisms can be regulated by putting on each edge (x, y) and for each particle\nat x, a clock with Exp(\u03bbkxy )-distributed intervals (where \u03bb > 0), each time the clock rings the\nparticle breeds in y. Equivalently one can associate to each particle at x a clock with Exp(\u03bbk(x))P\ndistributed intervals (k(x) = y kxy ): each time the clock rings the particle breeds and the offspring\n\nis placed at random according to a stochastic matrix P (where p(x, y) = kxy /k(x)).\n\nThe formal construction of a BRW in continuous time is based on the action of a semigroup with\ninfinitesimal generator\nLf (\u03b7) :=\n\nX\n\nx\u2208X\n\nwhere \u2202x\u00b1 f (\u03b7) := f (\u03b7 \u00b1 \u03b4x ) \u2212 f (\u03b7).\n\n\u0010\n\u0011\nX\n\u03b7(x) \u2202x\u2212 f (\u03b7) + \u03bb\nkxy \u2202y+ f (\u03b7) ,\n\n(2.5)\n\ny\u2208X\n\nEvery continuous-time BRW has a discrete-time counterpart and they both survive or both die\n\n(locally or globally); here is the construction. The initial particles represent the generation 0 of the\ndiscrete-time BRW; the generation n + 1 (for all n \u2265 0) is obtained by considering the children of\nall the particles of generation n (along with their positions). Clearly the progenies of the original\n\ncontinuous-time BRW and of its discrete-time counterpart are both finite (or both infinite) at the\nsame time. In this sense the theory of continuous-time BRWs, as long as we are interested in\nthe probability of survival (local, strong local and global), is a particular case of the theory of\ndiscrete-time BRWs.\nElementary calculations show that each particle living at x, before dying, has a random number\nof offsprings given by equation (2.3) where\n\u0012\n\u0013i\n1\n\u03bbk(x)\n\u03c1x (i) =\n,\n1 + \u03bbk(x) 1 + \u03bbk(x)\n\np(x, y) =\n\nkxy\n,\nk(x)\n\n(2.6)\n\nand this is the law of the discrete-time counterpart. Using equation (2.4), it is straightforward\nto show that mxy = \u03bbkxy . From equation (2.6) we have that, for any \u03bb > 0, the discrete-time\ncounterpart satisfies Assuption 2.1.\nGiven x0 \u2208 X, two critical parameters are associated to the continuous-time BRW: the global\n\nsurvival critical parameter \u03bbw (x0 ) and the local survival one \u03bbs (x0 ). They are defined as\n\u03bbw (x0 ) := inf{\u03bb > 0 : P\u03b4x0 (\u2203t : \u03b7t = 0) < 1}\n\u03bbs (x0 ) := inf{\u03bb > 0 : P\u03b4x0 (\u2203t\u0304 : \u03b7t (x0 ) = 0, \u2200t \u2265 t\u0304) < 1},\n\n(2.7)\n\nwhere 0 is the configuration with no particles at all sites and P\u03b4x0 is the law of the process which\nstarts with one individual in x0 . If the graph (X, E\u03bc ) is connected then these values do not depend\n6\n\n\fon the initial configuration, provided that this configuration is finite (that is, it has only a finite\nnumber of individuals), nor on the choice of x0 . See [2] and [3] for a more detailed discussion on\nthe values of \u03bbw (x0 ) and \u03bbs (x0 ).\n3. Technical definitions\nIn this section we give some technical definitions and we state some basic facts which are widely\nused in the rest of the paper.\n3.1. Reproduction trails. A fundamental tool which is useful throughout the whole paper is the\nreproduction trail; this allows us to give an alternative construction of the BRW. We fix an injective\nmap \u03c6 : X \u00d7 X \u00d7 Z \u00d7 N \u2192 N. Let the family {fi,n,x }i,n\u2208N,x\u2208X be as in Section 2.1 and let \u03b70 be the\n\ninitial value. For any fixed realization of the process we call reproduction trail to (x, n) \u2208 X \u00d7 N a\n\nsequence\n\n(x0 , i0 , 1), (x1 , i1 , j1 ), . . . , (xn , in , jn )\n\n(3.8)\n\nsuch that \u2212\u03b70 (x0 ) \u2264 i0 < 0, 0 < jl \u2264 fil\u22121 ,l\u22121,xl\u22121 (xl ) and \u03c6(xl\u22121 , xl , il\u22121 , jl ) = il , where 0 < l \u2264 n.\n\nThe interpretation is the following: in is the identification number of the particle, which lives at xn\n\nat time n and is the jn -th offspring of its parent. The sequence {x0 , x1 , . . . , xn } is the path induced\nby the trail (sometimes, we say that the trail is based on this path). Given any element (xl , il , jl )\n\nof the trail (3.8), we say that the particle identified by in is a descendant of generation n \u2212 l of the\n\nparticle identified by il and the trail joining them is (xl , il , jl ), . . . , (xn , in , jn ). We say also that the\ntrail of the particle in is a prolongation of the trail of the particle il .\nRoughly speaking the trail represents the past history of each single particle back to its original\nancestor, that is, the one living at time 0; we note that from the couple (n, in ), since the map \u03c6 is\ninjective, we can trace back the entire genealogy of the particle. The random variable \u03b7n (x) can\nbe alternatively defined as the number of reproduction trails to (x, n). This construction does not\ncoincide with the one induced by the equation (2.1) but the resulting processes have the same laws.\nFinally, when \u03bcx does not depend on x \u2208 X, it is worth mentioning another possible construction\n\nof the process as a Markov chain indexed by trees (see for instance [28, Section 5.C]).\n\n3.2. Generating functions. Later on we will need some generating functions, both 1-dimensional\nP\nP\n(n)\n(n)\nand infinite dimensional. Define Txn := y\u2208X mxy and \u03c6xy := x1 ,...,xn\u22121 \u2208X\\{y} mxx1 mx1 x2 * * * mxn\u22121 y\n(0)\n\n(by definition \u03c6xy := 0 for all x, y \u2208 X). Txn is the expected number of particles alive at time n\n(n)\n\nwhen the initial state is a single particle at x. The interpretation of \u03c6xy is more subtle. It plays\n\nin the BRW theory the same role played the first-return probabilities in random walk theory (see\n(n)\n\n[28, Section 1.C]). Roughly speaking, \u03c6xy is the expected number of particles alive at y at time\nn when the initial state is just one particle at x and the process behaves like a BRW except that\nevery particle reaching y at any time i < n is immediately killed (before breeding).\n7\n\n\fLet us consider the following family of 1-dimensional generating functions (depending on x, y \u2208\n\nX)\n\n\u0393(x, y|\u03bb) :=\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nn\nm(n)\nxy \u03bb ,\n\n\u03a6(x, y|\u03bb) :=\n\nIt is easy to prove that \u0393(x, x|\u03bb) =\n\nn\n\u03c6(n)\nxy \u03bb .\n\nn=1\n\nn=0\n\nP\n\n\u221e\nX\n\ni\ni\u2208N \u03a6(x, x|\u03bb)\n\nfor all \u03bb > 0, hence\n\u0013\u22121\n\u0012\nq\nn\n(n)\n,\n\u2200\u03bb \u2208 C : |\u03bb| < lim sup mxy\n\n1\n(3.9)\n,\n1 \u2212 \u03a6(x, x|\u03bb)\nn\u2208N\n\u0013\u22121\n\u0012\nq\nn\n(n)\n= max{\u03bb \u2208 R : \u03a6(x, x|\u03bb) \u2264 1} for all x \u2208 X. In\nand we have that lim supn\u2208N mxy\nq\nn\n(n)\nparticular \u03a6(x, x|1) \u2264 1 if and only if lim supn\u2208N mxy \u2264 1.\n\u0393(x, x|\u03bb) =\n\nTo the family {\u03bcx }x\u2208X we can associate another generating function G : [0, 1]X \u2192 [0, 1]X which\n\ncan be considered as an infinite dimensional power series (see also [3, Section 3]). More precisely,\nfor all z \u2208 [0, 1]X the function G(z) \u2208 [0, 1]X is defined as follows\nX\nY\nG(z|x) :=\n\u03bcx (f )\nz(y)f (y) .\n\n(3.10)\n\ny\u2208X\n\nf \u2208SX\n\nNote that G is continuous with respect to the pointwise convergence topology of [0, 1]X and nondecreasing with respect to the usual partial order of [0, 1]X (see [3, Sections 2 and 3] for further\ndetails); note that v < w means that v(x) \u2264 w(x) for all x \u2208 X and v(x0 ) < w(x0 ) for some x0 \u2208 X.\n\nAll these generating functions will be useful for instance in Section 4.1 to prove Theorem 4.1 and\nto discuss Examples 4.4 and 4.5. In Section 4.2 more properties of G will be established in order\nto prove some results related to local survival and strong local survival.\nNote that the generating function G can be explicitly computed, for instance, if equation (2.3)\nholds. Indeed in this case it is straightforward to show that G(z|x) = F (P z(x)) where F (y) =\nP\u221e\nP\n\u03c1\u0304x n\n1\nn\nn=0 \u03c1(n)y and P z(x) =\ny\u2208X p(x, y)z(y). In particular if \u03c1(n) = 1+\u03c1\u0304x ( 1+\u03c1\u0304x ) (for instance if\n\nwe are dealing with the discrete-time counterpart of a continuous-time BRW, see equation (2.6)),\nwe have G(z|x) =\n\n1\n1+\u03c1\u0304x (1\u2212P z(x)) ,\n\nthat is,\nG(z) =\n\n1\n1 + M (1 \u2212 z)\n\n(3.11)\n\nwhere 1(x) := 1 for all x \u2208 X, the ratio is to be intended as coordinatewise and M v(x) :=\nP\nX\ny\u2208X mxy v(y) for all v \u2208 [0, 1] ; in this case mxy is given by equation (2.4).\n\n3.3. Coupling. The family of BRWs can be extended to the more general class of truncated BRWs\nwhere a maximum of m \u2208 N\u222a{\u221e} particles per site are allowed; we denote this process as a BRWm .\nThe general dynamics is given by the following recursive relation\nm\n\nm\n\u03b7n+1\n(x)\n\n=m\u2227\n\nn (y)\nX \u03b7X\n\ny\u2208X i=1\n\nfi,n,y (x) = m \u2227\n8\n\n\u221e\nXX\n\ny\u2208X j=0\n\n1l{\u03b7nm (y)=j}\n\nj\nX\ni=1\n\nfi,n,y (x).\n\n(3.12)\n\n\fClearly the BRW\u221e is the usual BRW and the BRW1 is a contact process.\nIn the following sections we want to compare two (or more) truncated BRWs. What we are going\nto state is a discrete-time analogous of a well-known technique called coupling. Roughly speaking,\ngiven two processes {\u03b7n }n and {\u03ben }n , under certain conditions one can find two possibly different\n\nprocesses {\u03b7n\u2032 }n and {\u03ben\u2032 }n with the same finite-dimensional distribution as the original ones and\n\nsuch that if \u03b70\u2032 \u2265 \u03be0\u2032 then \u03b7n\u2032 \u2265 \u03ben\u2032 for all n \u2208 N.\n\nThe condition that we use is the following: suppose we have two families \u03bc = {\u03bcx }x\u2208X and\n\n\u03bd = {\u03bdx }x\u2208X such that \u03bcx (Fx\u22121 (*)) = \u03bdx (*) for all x \u2208 X and for some family of functions {Fx }x\u2208X\n\nsuch that Fx : supp(\u03bcx ) \u2192 supp(\u03bdx ) and Fx (f ) \u2264 f for all f \u2208 supp(\u03bcx ). The meaning of the maps\nFx is as follows: given any possible offspring outcome g of a particle living at x (breeding according\nto the law \u03bdx ) there is a set of outcomes which occurs with the same probability, namely Fx\u22121 (g),\nfor a particle living at x (breeding according to the law \u03bcx ); furthermore the number of newborn\nparticles in the first case is pointwise not larger than the number of newborns in the second one.\nThis suggests that the BRW (X, \u03bc), in some sense, dominates the BRW (X, \u03bd). Under the previous\ncondition, given k \u2264 m \u2264 \u221e, it is possible to construct a process {(\u03b7nm , \u03benk )}n\u2208N such that\n(1) {\u03b7nm }n\u2208N is a BRWm behaving according to \u03bc;\n(2) {\u03benk }n\u2208N is a BRWk behaving according to \u03bd;\n(3) \u03b70m \u2265 \u03be0k implies \u03b7nm \u2265 \u03benk for all n \u2208 N a.s.\n\nTo check (3), note that, for any x \u2208 X, given the family of random variables {fi,n,x }i,n\u2208N (with\n\nlaw \u03bcx ) then {Fx (fi,n,x )}i,n\u2208N are iid with common law \u03bdx . Whence the evolution equation of\n\n{\u03b7nm }n\u2208N is (3.12) and, similarly, {\u03benk }n\u2208N satisfies\nk\n\u03ben+1\n(x) = k \u2227\n\nn (y)\nX \u03beX\n\ny\u2208X i=1\n\nFx \u25e6 fi,n,y (x),\n\n(3.13)\n\nwhence (3) follows by induction using equations (3.12) and (3.13). A typical choice for the family\nof functions {Fx }x\u2208X is Fx (f ) := f |Y (where Y \u2286 X) which can be seen as a (truncated) BRW\n\nrestricted to Y , that is, all the offsprings sent outside Y are killed.\n\nThis procedure of comparison is called coupling between {\u03b7nm }n\u2208N and {\u03benk }n\u2208N . We note that\n\nif {\u03b7nm }n\u2208N dies out locally (resp. globally) a.s. then {\u03benk }n\u2208N dies out locally (resp. globally) a.s.\nMore generally a coupling between {\u03b7nm }n\u2208N and {\u03benk }n\u2208N is a choice of a common law {\u03b6x }x\u2208X\n\nfor the process {(\u03b7nm , \u03benk )}n\u2208N such that \u03b6x ((f, g) : f \u2265 g, f, g \u2208 SX ) = 1 for all x \u2208 X and\nP\nP\nf \u2208SX \u03b6x ((f, g)) = \u03bdx (g). In many situations this construction of\ng\u2208SX \u03b6x ((f, g)) = \u03bcx (f ),\n{\u03b6x }x\u2208X can be carried out effortlessly.\n\n4. Local, strong local and global survival\n4.1. Local and global survival. Consider the discrete-time BRW generated by the family \u03bc =\n{\u03bcx }x of probabilities and suppose now that the process starts with one particle at x0 , hence\n9\n\n\f\u03b70 = \u03b4x0 . In this section we want to find conditions for global, local and strong local survival.\nRecall that if X is finite then local survival is equivalent to global survival: this is trivial for an\nirreducible matrix M ; in the general case global survival, starting from x0 , is equivalent to local\nsurvival at some y \u2208 X such that x0 \u2192 y (the same arguments of [3, Remark 4.4] apply).\nTheorem 4.1. Let (X, \u03bc) be a BRW.\n(1) There is local survival starting from x0 if and only if lim supn\u2192\u221e\n\nq\nn\n\n(n)\n\nmx0 x0 > 1.\n\n(2) There is global survival starting from x0 if and only if there exists z \u2208 [0, 1]X , z(x0 ) < 1,\nsuch that G(z|x) \u2264 z(x), for all x.\n\n(3) If there is global survival starting from x0 , then there exists v \u2208 [0, 1]X , v(x0 ) > 0, such that\na) M v \u2265 v\n\nb) for all x, M v(x) = v(x) if and only if G(1 \u2212 (1 \u2212 t)v; x)\nq = 1 \u2212 (1 \u2212 t)v(x), \u2200t \u2208 [0, 1].\n(n)\nn P\n(4) If there is global survival starting from x0 , then lim inf n\u2208N\nx\u2208X mx0 x \u2265 1.\n(5) If X is aqfinite set then there is global survival starting from x0 if and only if\n(n)\nn P\nlim inf n\u2208N\nx\u2208X mx0 x > 1.\n\nProof.\n\n(1) Fix x0 \u2208 X, consider a path \u03a0 := {x0 , x1 , . . . , xn = x0 } and consider its number\n\nof cycles #{i = 1, . . . , n : xi = x0 }; the expected number of trails based on such a path\nQn\u22121\nis i=0\nmxi xi+1 . This is also the expected number of particles living at x0 , descending\n\nfrom the original particle at x0 and whose genealogy is described by the path \u03a0, that is,\n\ntheir mothers were at xn\u22121 , their grandmothers at xn\u22122 and so on. We associate to the\nBRW starting at x0 a Galton\u2013Watson branching process with a different time scale as in [2,\nTheorem 3.1] and [3, Theorems 4.1 and 4.7] where the n-th generation is the set of particles\nliving at x0 whose trail are based on paths with n cycles. This process is nonsingular due\nto Assumption 2.1, and its survival is equivalent to the local survival of the BRW. The\nexpected number of children in this branching process is \u03a6(x,\nq x|1), thus we have a.s. local\nn\n(n)\nextinction if and only if \u03a6(x, x|1) \u2264 1, that is, lim supn\u2208N mxy \u2264 1.\n\n(2) Let q\u0304n (x) and q\u0304(x) be the probability of global extinction before or at the n-th generation\n\nand the probability of global extinction respectively, starting from a single initial particle\nat x. Clearly q\u0304n+1 = G(q\u0304n ) and q\u0304n \u2192 q\u0304 as n \u2192 \u221e. If q\u0304(x0 ) < 1 then take z = q\u0304 as a\nsolution of G(z) \u2264 z (remember that G is continuous). On the other hand, if there exists\n\nz \u2208 [0, 1]X such that z(x0 ) < 1 and G(z) \u2264 z, since G is nondecreasing and q\u03040 = 0 \u2264 z then\n\nq\u0304n \u2264 z for all n \u2208 N, hence q\u0304 \u2264 z. Thus q\u0304(x0 ) < 1.\n\n(3) Let z such that G(z) \u2264 z, z(x0 ) < 1. Define v = 1 \u2212 z, take the derivative of the\nconvex function \u03c6(t) := G(1 \u2212 (1 \u2212 t)v; x) \u2212 1 + (1 \u2212 t)v(x) at t = 1 and remember that\n\n\u03c6(0) \u2264 \u03c6(1) = 0.\n\n10\n\n\f(4) If there is global survival starting from x0 \u2208 X then there exists v \u2208 [0, 1]X such that\nP\n(n)\nv(x0 ) > 0 and M v \u2265 v. Hence M n v \u2265 v for all n \u2208 N, that is, y\u2208X mxy v(y) \u2265 v(x); in\nq\nP\nP (n)\n(n)\nparticular, y\u2208X mx0 y \u2265 v(x0 ) > 0 and this implies lim inf n\u2192\u221e n\ny mx0 y \u2265 1.\n\n(5) Since X is finite there is global survival starting from x0 if and onlyqif there is local survival\nstarting from some w \u2208 X such that x0 \u2192 w, that is, lim supn\u2208N\nfinite, it is easy to show that\nsX\n(n)\nmx 0 x =\nlim inf n\nn\u2208N\n\nx\u2208X\n\nmax\n\nw\u2208X:x0 \u2192w\n\nlim sup\nn\u2208N\n\nwhence there is global survival if and only if lim inf n\u2208N\nsumption 2.1 and Remark 2.2).\n\nq\nn\n\n(n)\n\nmww > 1. Since M is\n\n(n)\n\nmww\n\nq\nn\n\nn\n\nP\n\n(n)\n\nx\u2208X\n\nmx0 x > 1 (see also As\u0003\n\nFirst of all, observe that it is easyqto show, by using supermultiplicative arguments, that\nqP\nn\n(n)\n(n)\nlim inf n\u2192\u221e n\nmxx . In terms of survival, studying a continuous-time\ny mxy \u2265 lim supn\u2192\u221e\n\nBRW with rates {\u03bbkxy }x,y\u2208X is equivalent to studying its discrete-time counterpart (that is, a\nBRW where {\u03bcx }x\u2208X is given by equations (2.3) and (2.6)). If we apply Theorem 4.1 to a discrete-\n\ntime counterpart then we obtain [3, Theorems 4.1, 4.3 and 4.7]. Moreover, according to [3, Theorem\n4.2](c), for the discrete-time counterpart of a continuous-time BRW, global survival starting from\nx0 is equivalent to the existence of v \u2208 [0, 1]X , v(x0 ) > 0, such that M v \u2265 v. This is a necessary\n\ncondition for global survival for all discrete-time BRWs. Finally, note that the proof of part (1) of\nthe previous theorem holds as well even if {mxy } is unbounded or mxy = +\u221e for some x, y \u2208 X.\n\nAn independent proof was given in [23, Theorem 2.4] using a different, more analytic, technique.\n\nSpeaking of global survival, it is easy to show that, given any solution of G(z) \u2264 z, then z(x) is\n\nan upper bound for the probability of extinction q\u0304(x). Moreover the existence of a solution as in\n\nTheorem 4.1(2) is equivalent to the existence of a solution of G(z) = z such that z(x0 ) < 1. From the\nproof we have that, if q\u0304 is the possibly infinite-dimensional vector of extinction probabilities, then\nq\u0304 is the smallest solution of G(z) = z (and of G(z) \u2264 z); for this solution, z(x) < 1 simultaneously\n\nfor all x such that there is global solution starting from x. Thus, if a BRW is irreducible and there\nis global survival starting from one vertex then the solution q\u0304 satisfies q\u0304(x) < 1 for all x \u2208 X. For\n\na more detailed discussion on the generating function G and its properties we refer to [3, Sections\n\n2 and 3]. Of course, the possibility of computing an explicit solution of the inequality G(z) \u2264 z\n\nrelies on the explicit knowledge of the generating function G. This can be done in a few cases: for\n\ninstance if equation (2.3) holds (see Section 3.2); in particular, for any discrete-time counterpart\nof a continuous-time BRW, G satisfies equation (3.11). We show how to manage this inequality in\nExamples 4.4 and 4.5. As for the inequalities in Theorem 4.1(1), (4) and (5), they can be easily\nchecked under some regularity conditions (such as transitivity, see Section 4.2 for the definition) or\n11\n\n\fwhen the BRW is an F-BRW (see Definition 4.2). In particular it has been shown in [11] that the\ninequality in Theorem 4.1(1) can still be checked in particular random environments.\n\nBesides, according to Theorem 4.1(1) the local survival depends only on M , hence if we have\ntwo BRWs, say (X, \u03bc) and (X, \u03bd) with first-moment matrices M and M respectively, satisfying\nmxy \u2265 mxy (for all x, y \u2208 X) then the local survival at x0 for (X, \u03bd) implies the local survival\n\nat x0 for (X, \u03bc). In Example 4.4 we show that, for a general BRW, the global survival does not\n\ndepend only on M nevertheless a characterization of global survival in terms of M alone holds\nfor special classes of BRWs. The first example is given by the class of discrete-time counterparts\nof continuous-time BRWs and this is due to Theorem 4.1(2) and to the fact that, in this case, G\ndepends only on M (see equation (3.11)). Another class is described by the following definition.\nDefinition 4.2. We say that a BRW (X, \u03bc) is locally isomorphic to a BRW (Y, \u03bd) if there exists\na surjective map g : X \u2192 Y such that\n\uf8eb\n\n\u03bdg(x) (f ) = \u03bcx \uf8edh : \u2200y \u2208 Y, f (y) =\n\nX\n\nz\u2208g \u22121 (y)\n\n\uf8f6\n\nh(z)\uf8f8 ,\n\n\u2200f \u2208 SY .\n\n(4.14)\n\nWe say that (X, \u03bc) is a F-BRW if it is locally isomorphic to some BRW (Y, \u03bd) on a finite set Y .\nThe idea behind the previous definition is that g acts like a \"projection\" from X onto Y and,\nfrom the point of view of the BRW, all the vertices in g\u22121 (y) looks similar. Besides, the class of\nF-BRWs extends the class of multitype BRWs: an F-BRW identifies a multitype BRW (see the\nproof of Theorem 4.3 for details) in a way that they have the same global behavior. Of course,\n\nthey may have different local behaviors. We note that quasi-transitive BRWs (see Section 6.2 for\nthe formal definition) are F-BRWs. Another example of an F-BRW is given by a BRW satisfying\n\nequation (2.3) where \u03c1x is independent of x \u2208 X, say \u03c1x = \u03c1 for all x \u2208 X; in this case one simply\n\nchooses Y = {0}, that is, a branching process with reproduction law \u03c1. There are F-BRWs which\n\nare not quasi-transitive: an example is the discrete-time counterpart of the continuous-time BRW\ngiven in [2, Example 3.1].\nThe function g induces a map \u03c0g : SX \u2192 SY defined as \u03c0g (f )(y) =\n\nequation (4.14) becomes \u03bdg(x) (*) =\n\n\u03bcx (\u03c0g\u22121 (*)).\n\nP\n\nx\u2208g \u22121 (y)\n\nf (x) hence\n\nClearly if {\u03b7n }n\u2208N is a realization of (X, \u03bc) then\n\n{\u03c0g (\u03b7n )}n\u2208N is a realization of (Y, \u03bd). Moreover it is easy to show that, for all x \u2208 X, y \u2208 Y ,\nP\nP\nP\nP\nm\ne g(x)y := w\u2208SY w(g(x))\u03bdy (w) = f \u2208SX z\u2208g\u22121 (y) f (z)\u03bcx (f ) = z\u2208g\u22121 (y) mxz (that is, m\ne g(x) y =\n\u03c0g (mx * )(y)). This means that the expected number of offsprings at y of a particle living at g(x)\n\n(on the projected BRW (Y, \u03bd)) is the sum of the expected numbers of offsprings at z of a particle\nP\nliving at x (on the BRW (X, \u03bc)) over all z \u2208 X whose projection is y. Thus y\u2208Y m\ne g(x) y =\nP\nz\u2208X mxz . By induction on n \u2208 N one can prove that, for all x \u2208 X, y \u2208 Y, n \u2208 N, we have\nP\nP\nP\n(n)\n(n)\n(n)\n(n)\ne g(x)y = z\u2208X mxz . It is not difficult to show that (X, \u03bc)\nm\ne g(x)y = z\u2208g\u22121 (y) mxz whence y\u2208Y m\nis locally isomorphic to (Y, \u03bd) if and only if GX (z \u25e6 g|x) = GY (z|g(x)) for all z \u2208 [0, 1]Y , x \u2208 X.\n12\n\n\fThe following result characterizes the global survival of a F-BRW in terms of M .\nTheorem 4.3. Let (X, \u03bc) is locally isomorphic to (Y, \u03bd) and consider the following:\n(1) there is global survival for (X, \u03bc) starting from x0 \u2208 X,\n\n(2) there is global\nsurvival for (Y, \u03bd) starting from g(x0 ) \u2208 Y ,\nqP\n(n)\nn\n(3) lim inf n\u2192\u221e\ny mx0 y > 1;\n\nthen (1) \u21d0\u21d2 (2). Moreover if Y is finite (hence X is an F-BRW) then (3) \u21d0\u21d2 (2).\n(n)\n\n(n)\n\nProof. (1) \u21d0\u21d2 (2). IIt is easy to show, by induction on n \u2208 N, that GX (z \u25e6 g|x) = GY (z|g(x))\n\nfor all z \u2208 [0, 1]Y , x \u2208 X (where G(n+1) (z) = G(n) (G(z))). This implies that q\u0304nY (g(x)) = q\u0304nX (x) for\n\nall n \u2208 N. Hence, as n \u2192 \u221e, we have that the minimal fixed points of these generating functions\nsatisfy q\u0304 Y (g(x)) = q\u0304 X (x).\n\nP\nP\n(n)\n(n)\n(1) \u21d0\u21d2 (3). Since, for all n \u2208 N, we have z\u2208X mxy = y\u2208Y m\ne g(x)y then\nsX\nsX\n(n)\n(n)\nlim inf n\nmx0 x = lim inf n\nm\ne g(x0 )y .\nn\u2208N\n\nn\u2208N\n\nx\u2208X\n\ny\u2208Y\n\nThe claim follows from Theorem 4.1(5) being Y finite.\n\n\u0003\n\nSince, within some classes, the global behavior can be characterized completely by M , one can\nwonder if the same holds for a general BRW or, alternatively, if given two generic BRWs with\nthe same first-moment matrix then they have the same global behavior. In particular one could\nconjecture that at least one of the two necessary conditions given in Theorem 4.1(3) and (4) is\nalso sufficient. All these conjectures are false as the following example shows (the main tool is\nTheorem 4.1(2)).\nExample 4.4. Let X = N and consider the family of BRWs (N, \u03bc) with \u03bci = pi \u03b4ni 1l{i+1} + (1\u2212 pi )\u03b40\n(where 1l{i+1} \u2208 SN is defined by 1l{i+1} (x) = 1 if x = i + 1 and 0 otherwise). Roughly speaking,\n\neach particle at i has ni children at i + 1 with probability pi and no children at all with probability\n\n1 \u2212 pi . According to Theorem 4.1(2) global survival starting from 0 is equivalent to the existence of\nz \u2208 [0, 1]N , z(0) < 1, such that G(z|i) \u2264 z(i), for all i where G(z|i) = pi z(i + 1)ni + 1 \u2212 pi . Note\nthat pz n + 1 \u2212 p \u2192 1 if p \u2192 0 or z \u2192 1.\n\nClearly if ni = n, pi = p and np > 1 the BRW survives globally (take for instance n = 4 and\n\np = 1/2). Let us suppose that pi = 2/ni . We construct iteratively a sequence {ni }i\u2208N such that the\n\nunique solution of G(z) \u2264 z is z(i) = 1 for all i \u2208 N.\nClearly G(z) \u2264 z implies\n\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\nz(0) \u2265 n20 z(1)n1 + 1 \u2212 n20\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n2\n2\nn2\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2z(1) \u2265 n1 z(2) + 1 \u2212 n1\n...\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\nz(k) \u2265 n2k z(k + 1)nk + 1 \u2212\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3z(k + 1) \u2265 1 \u2212 2 .\nnk+1\n13\n\n(4.15)\n2\nnk\n\n\ffor all k \u2208 N. Let n0 = 4 and suppose we already fixed {ni }ki=0 . If nk+1 \u2192 \u221e then a solution of\n\nequation (4.15) satisfies z(i) \u2192 1 for all i \u2264 k + 1. Choose nk+1 such that z(i) \u2265 k/(k + 1) for all\n\ni \u2264 k + 1. This implies that the unique solution of the family of systems (depending on k) given by\n\nequation (4.15) is z(i) = 1 for all i \u2208 N. Thus this is q\nthe only solution of G(z) \u2264 z and the BRW\nP\n(n)\ndoes not survive globally a.s. In this case lim inf n\u2192\u221e n\ny mx0 y = 2, thus this example shows in\nqP\n(n)\nparticular that lim inf n\u2192\u221e n y mx0 y > 1 does not imply, in general, global survival.\nThe first-moment matrix of the BRW above is not irreducible and the BRW can be identified with\n\na time-inhomogeneous branching process; a slight modification allows us to construct an irreducible\nBRW. We just sketch the main steps.\nAgain let X = N and consider the family of BRWs \u03bci = pi \u03b4ni 1l{i+1} +1l{i\u22121} + (1 \u2212 pi )\u03b40 (for all\n\ni \u2265 1) and \u03bc0 = p0 \u03b4n0 1l{1} + (1 \u2212 p0 )\u03b40 . In this case each particle at i \u2265 1 has ni children at i + 1\n\nand 1 at i \u2212 1 with probability pi and no children at all with probability 1 \u2212 pi ; each particle at 0\nhas the same behavior as in the previous example. The generating function G is\n(\npi z(i + 1)ni z(i \u2212 1) + 1 \u2212 pi i \u2265 1\nG(z|i) =\np0 z(1)n0 + 1 \u2212 p0\ni = 0.\n\nG(z) \u2264 z implies, for all k,\n\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\nz(0) \u2265 p0 z(1)n0 + 1 \u2212 p0\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4z(1) \u2265 p1 z(2)n1 z(0) + 1 \u2212 p1\n\uf8f2\n...\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\nz(k) \u2265 pk z(k + 1)nk z(k \u2212 1) + 1 \u2212 pk\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3z(k + 1) \u2265 1 \u2212 p .\nk+1\n\n(4.16)\n\nIt is not difficult to prove that, if pk+1 \u2192 0 then z(k + 1) \u2192 1) and the set of solutions of equa-\n\ntion (4.16) is eventually contained in any \u03b5-enlargements of the set of vectors (z0 (1), z0 (2), . . . , z0 (k), 1),\nwhere (z0 (1), z0 (2), . . . , z0 (k)) is ranging in the set of solutions of\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\nz(0) \u2265 p0 z(1)n0 + 1 \u2212 p0\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\nn1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2z(1) \u2265 p1 z(2) z(0) + 1 \u2212 p1\n...\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4z(k \u2212 1) \u2265 pk\u22121 z(k)nk\u22121 z(k \u2212 2) + 1 \u2212 pk\u22121\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3z(k) \u2265 p z(k \u2212 1) + 1 \u2212 p .\nk\nk\n\n(4.17)\n\nLet us study this last equation. We note that if ni pi pi+1 \u2264 (1 \u2212 \u03b5)/2 for all i \u2208 N and for some\n\n\u03b5 > 0 then there is a unique solution of equation (4.17), that is z(i) = 1 for all i = 0, . . . , k. Indeed\ne\nequation (4.17) represents the system G(z)\n\u2264 z for an irreducible BRW on {0, 1, . . . , k} where\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\nif i = 0\n\uf8f2p0 \u03b4n0 1l{1} + (1 \u2212 p0 )\u03b40\n\u03bc\nei = pi \u03b4ni 1l{i+1} +1l{i\u22121} + (1 \u2212 pi )\u03b40 if i = 1, . . . , k \u2212 1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\nif i = k.\npk \u03b41l{k\u22121} + (1 \u2212 pk )\u03b40\n14\n\n\fIndeed, since the graph is finite and connected, according q\nto Theorem 4.1(2) and (5) there exists\nP (n)\nn\ne\ne ij > 1 for some (\u21d0\u21d2 for all)\na solution z 6= 1 of G(z)\n\u2264 z if and only if lim inf n\u2192\u221e\njm\n\ni \u2208 {0, 1, . . .q\n, k}; but, again since the graph is finite, the previous conditions are equivalent to\nlim supn\u2192\u221e\n\nthat\n\nn\n\n(n)\n\nm\ne ii > 1 for some (\u21d0\u21d2 for all) i \u2208 {0, 1, . . . , k}.

Note that if pi = 2/ni < (1 \u2212 \u03b5)/4 for all i \u2208 N then\n\npi+1 pi ni < (1 \u2212 \u03b5)/2.\n\nIf k = 1 then we can choose n1 such that z(i) > 1/2 for all i \u2264 1. Indeed if n1 \u2192 \u221e then p1 \u2192 0\n\nand both z(1), z(0) \u2192 1.\n\nSuppose we fixed n0 , . . . , nk such that any solution of equation (4.16) satisfies z(i) \u2265 k/(k + 1)\n\nfor all i \u2264 k and such that pi < (1 \u2212 \u03b5)/4 for all i = 0, . . . , k. If nk+1 \u2192 \u221e then z(k + 1) \u2192 1\nhence any solution of equation (4.16) must converge as before to a solution of equation (4.17). Hence\nnk+1 \u2192 \u221e implies z(i) \u2192 1 for all i \u2264 k +1 and we can choose nk+1 such that z(i) \u2265 (k +1)/(k +2)\nfor all i \u2264 k + 1. This yields the conclusion.\n\nFinally we note that if the BRW is given by \u03bci = 1/2 \u03b441l {i+1} + pi \u03b41l{i\u22121} + (1/2 \u2212 pi )\u03b40 (for all\n\ni \u2265 1) and \u03bc0 = 1/2\u03b441l{1} + 1/2\u03b40 (where pi is the same as before) then it survives globally, hence,\neven for irreducible\nqP BRWs, global survival does not depend only on the first-moment matrix M and\n(n)\nlim inf n\u2192\u221e n\ny mx0 y > 1 does not imply, in general, global survival.\nAnother possible question arises from Theorem 4.1: is it true that\n\nP\n\ny\u2208X\n\nmxy < 1 for all x \u2208 X\n\nimplies global extinction? According to the following example (see also [3, Example 1]), the answer\nis negative.\nExample 4.5. As before, we start by giving an example which is not irreducible, later on we modify\nthe process in order to obtain an irreducible BRW.\nLet X = N, {pn }n\u2208N be a sequence in (0, 1] and suppose that a particle at n has one child\n\nat n + 1 with probability pn and no children with probability 1 \u2212 pn (this is the reducible process\n\nof the previous example with ni = 1 for all i \u2208 N). The generating function of this process is\ne\nG(z|n)\n= 1 \u2212 pn + pn z(n + 1). Again this BRW can be identified with a time-inhomogeneous\nbranching process which has a probability of extinction, starting with one particle at n, equal to\nQ\nP\u221e\nz(n) = 1 \u2212 \u221e\ni=n pi ; hence it survives wpp, if and only if\ni=1 (1 \u2212 pi ) < +\u221e. It is straightforward\n\nto check that z is a solution of G(z) = z.\n\n15\n\n\fThis process is stochastically dominated by the irreducible BRW where each particle at n \u2265 1 has\n\none child at n + 1 with probability pn , one child at n \u2212 1 with probability (1 \u2212 pn )/2 (if n = 0 then it\nhas one child of type 0 with probability (1 \u2212 p0 )/2) and no children at all with probability (1 \u2212 pn )/2.\n\nThe generating function G can be explicitly computed\n(\n1\u2212pn\n1\u2212pn\n2 + 2 z(n \u2212 1) + pn z(n + 1)\nG(z|n) = 1\u2212p\n1\u2212p0\n0\n2 + 2 z(0) + p0 z(1)\n\nn\u22651\nn = 0.\n\nBy coupling this process with the previous one or, simply, by applying Theorem 4.1(2) (z(n) =\nQ\nP\u221e\n1\u2212 \u221e\ni ) < +\u221e implies global survival.\ni=n pi is a solution of G(z) \u2264 z) one can prove that\ni=1 (1\u2212p\nqP\nP\n(n)\nNote that here j\u2208N mij = (1 + pi )/2 < 1; clearly, lim inf n\u2192\u221e n j\u2208N mij = 1.\nAnalogous examples could be constructed for continuous time BRWs as well. For instance, an\n\nexample of a continuous-time BRW which survives globally at the global critical point \u03bb = \u03bbw can\nbe found in [3, Example 3].\n4.2. Local survival and strong local survival. We know that q\u0304 is the smallest fixed point of\nG(z) in [0, 1]X , where q\u0304(x) is the probability of global extinction starting from x. Moreover, if a\nsequence {zn }n\u2208N , defined recursively by zn+1 = G(zn ), has a limit z, then z = G(z) and, if the\nsequence is non decreasing, then z = q\u0304 if and only if z0 \u2264 q\u0304.\n\nDefine qn (x, A) as the probability of extinction before generation n + 1 in A starting with one\n\nparticle at x. It is clear that {qn (x, A)}n\u2208N is a nondecreasing sequence satisfying\n(\nqn (*, A) = G(qn\u22121 (*, A)),\n\u2200n \u2265 1\nq0 (x, A) = 0,\n\u2200x \u2208 A,\nhence there is a limit q(x, A) = limn\u2192\u221e qn (x, A) \u2208 [0, 1]X which is the probability of local extinction\n\nin A starting with one particle at x. Clearly q(*, A) = G(q(*, A)), hence these probabilities are fixed\n\npoints of G. It is easy to show that A \u2286 B implies q(*, A) \u2265 q(*, B); in particular q(*, \u2205) = 1, and\n\nq(*, X) = q\u0304. The probability q(*, {y}) of local extinction at y starting from x is denoted simply by\n\nq(*, y). In general q(*, y) \u2265 q\u0304 for all y \u2208 X and q(*, y) = q\u0304 if and only if q0 (*, y) \u2264 q\u0304. If for some\n\ny \u2208 X we have q(*, y) = q\u0304 then the global survival starting from x implies the strong local survival\n\nat y starting from x.\n\nIn the special case when the set A of fixed points for G is reduced to the minimal one {q\u0304, 1},\n\nthen either there is no local survival at y starting from every fixed vertex x (that is, q(*, y) = 1) or\nthe global survival at x implies the strong local survival at y (that is, q(*, y) = q\u0304). Clearly, since\nQ\nq\u0304 is the smallest fixed point of G then A \u2286 x\u2208X [q\u0304(x), 1]. Thus, it would be important to find\n\nconditions for either A = {q\u0304, 1} or, when it is possible, for q(*, y) = q\u0304 for all y \u2208 X. Discussing\n\nsuch conditions in details goes beyond the purpose of this paper, but we want to give one result\nabout the strong local survival of a class of regular discrete-time BRWs to give an idea of what can\nbe done.\n16\n\n\fDefinition 4.6. Let \u03b3 : X \u2192 X be an injective map. We say that \u03bc = {\u03bcx }x\u2208X is \u03b3-invariant if\nfor all x, y \u2208 X and f \u2208 SX we have \u03bcx (f ) = \u03bc\u03b3(x) (f \u25e6 \u03b3 \u22121 ). Moreover (X, \u03bc) is transitive if and\n\nonly if there exists x0 \u2208 X such that for all x \u2208 X there exists a bijective map \u03b3 : X \u2192 X satisfying\n\u03b3(x0 ) = x and \u03bc is \u03b3-invariant.\n\nProposition 4.7. Let (X, \u03bc) be a discrete-time BRW with an irreducible matrix M . Then there\nis local survival at some y \u2208 X starting from some x \u2208 X if and only if there is local survival at\n\nall y \u2208 X starting from every fixed x \u2208 X. Moreover, if the BRW is transitive then local survival\n\nimplies strong local survival.\n\nProof. Since the BRW is transitive, then the probability q\u0304(x) of global extinction does not depend\non the starting point x and, analogously, the probability q(x, x) of local extinction at x starting\nfrom x is independent of x \u2208 X. Moreover the matrix M is irreducible then for all x, y \u2208 X we\n\nhave q(x, x) = q(x, y). This, along with transitivity, implies that there are \u03b1, \u03b2 \u2208 [0, 1] such that\nP\n\u03b1 \u2264 \u03b2 and q\u0304 = \u03b11 and q(*, y) = \u03b21 for all y \u2208 X. Note that h(t) := G(t1; x) = n\u2208N \u03c1x (n)tn does\n\nnot depend on x; moreover h(\u03b1) = \u03b1, h(\u03b2) = \u03b2 and h(1) = 1. If there is local survival then \u03b2 < 1\nand this, along with Assumption 2.1, implies that h is strictly convex, thus \u03b1 = \u03b2. This implies\nq(*, y) = q\u0304 for all y \u2208 X.\n\n\u0003\n\nFor a similar result concerning the strong survival of a BRW on a random environment on Z see [11].\nRemark 4.8. We note that if a continuous-time BRW is \u03b3-invariant according to [4, Section 5]\nthen the discrete-time counterpart is \u03b3-invariant. Hence, the previous result can be helpful to study\nthe regularity of the extinction probabilities q\u03bb (x, y) and q\u0304\u03bb , as functions of \u03bb, of a discrete-time\ncounterpart of a continuous-time BRW (see equation (2.6)). They are both nonincreasing functions;\nP\nfor instance if k(x) = y\u2208X kxy = k\u0304 then q\u0304\u03bb (x) = min(1/\u03bbk\u0304, 1) for all x \u2208 X.\nRemember the explicit analytic form of G given by equation (3.11): since M = \u03bbK there is a\n\ndependence of G = G\u03bb on \u03bb; it is straightforward to show that\nsup |G\u03bb (z; x) \u2212 G\u03bb\u2032 (z; x)| \u2264 |\u03bb \u2212 \u03bb\u2032 | sup\n\nX\n\nx\u2208X y\u2208X\n\nx\u2208X\n\nkxy .\n\nMoreover \u03bb \u2265 \u03bb\u2032 implies G\u03bb (z) \u2264 G\u03bb\u2032 (z) for all z \u2208 [0, 1]X . Using these properties, along with the\nfact that q\u0304\u03bb is the smallest solution of G\u03bb (z) \u2264 z (see [3] for details) it is easy to prove that q\u0304\u03bb \u2191 q\u0304\u03bb\u2032\n\nas \u03bb \u2193 \u03bb\u2032 . In the irreducible case, q\u0304\u03bb = 1 for all \u03bb < \u03bbw and [3, Example 3] shows that it may\n\nhappen that q\u0304\u03bbw < 1 which implies that q\u0304\u03bb can be discontinuous from the left.\n\nAs for q\u03bb (x, y), clearly in the irreducible case q\u03bb (*, y) = 1 for all \u03bb \u2264 \u03bbs . On the other hand in\n\nthe irreducible and transitive case we just proved that q\u0304\u03bb = q\u03bb (*, y) for all \u03bb > \u03bbs hence if \u03bbs > \u03bbw\n\nin general q\u0304\u03bbs < 1, thus lim\u03bb\u2193\u03bbs q\u03bb (*, y) = q\u0304\u03bbs < 1 = q\u03bbs (*, y). Hence q\u03bb (*, y) can be discontinuous\nfrom the right.\n17\n\n\f5. Spatial approximation\n5.1. Generalization of a Theorem of Sarymshakov\u2013Seneta. Given a matrix M = (mxy )x,y\u2208X ,\nrecall the usual classification of indices of a matrix as described in [25, Chapter 1]. For any index x\nwe denote by [x] its class, that is, the set of indices which communicate with x. We define the con\u0012\n\u0013\u22121\nq\nn\n(n)\nand R := inf x,y\u2208X R(x, y); it is well known\nvergence parameters R(x, y) := lim supn\u2208N mxy\nq\nq\nn\nn\n(n)\n(n)\nthat lim supn\u2208N mxy = lim supn\u2208N mx1 y1 if [x] = [x1 ] and [y] = [y1 ]; in particular R(x, y) is\nindependent of x, y if the matrix is irreducible.\n\nLet {Xn }n\u2208N be a sequence of subsets of X and denote by n R the convergence parameter of\n\nMn = (mxy )x,y\u2208Xn ; clearly, if the sequence {Xn }n\u2208N is nondecreasing, we have that n R \u2265\n\nn+1 R.\n\nThe following theorem generalizes [25, Theorem 6.8] (note that the submatrices {Mn }n\u2208N are\nnot necessarily irreducible); it is the key to prove our main result about spatial approximation\n(Theorem 5.2).\nTheorem 5.1. Let {Xn }n\u2208N be a general sequence of subsets of X such that lim inf n\u2192\u221e Xn = X.\nThen for all x0 \u2208 X we have n R(x0 , x0 ) \u2192 R(x0 , x0 ). Moreover if M is irreducible and Mn =\n(mxy )x,y\u2208Xn then n R \u2192 R as n \u2192 \u221e and, in particular, for all x0 \u2208 X we have n R(x0 , x0 ) \u2192 R.\n\nProof. Suppose that M is irreducible. We start by showing that if {Xn }n\u2208N is a nondecreasing\nS\nsequence of subsets of N such that n\u2208N Xn = X then n R \u2193 R as n \u2192 \u221e and n R(x0 , x0 ) \u2192 R\n\nfor all x0 \u2208 X. If Mn are all irreducible then the claim follows easily from [25, Theorem 6.8]. In\nthe general case, fix an index x0 \u2208 X and consider the sequence of sets {Jn }n\u2208N where Jn is the\nclass of x0 in Xn . Given any index x, we have that x \u2208 Jn eventually as n \u2192 \u221e; indeed if A\n\nis the set of vertices in a path connecting x0 to x and back (which exists since M is irreducible)\nS\ne the convergence\nthen eventually A \u2286 Xn which implies A \u2286 Jn thus n Jn = X. Let us call n R\nfn = (mxy )x,y\u2208Jn . Since M\nfn is an irreducible submatrix of Mn then, according to\nparameter of M\ne \u2193 R. On the other hand R \u2264 n R \u2264 n R(x0 , x0 ) \u2264 n R(x\ne 0 , x0 ) = n R\ne which\n[25, Theorem 6.8], n R\nyields the conclusion for a nondecreasing sequence of subsets.\n\nIf {Xn }n\u2208N is not monotone, then consider a nondecreasing sequence {Xn\u2032 }n\u2208N of finite subsets\nS\nof X such that n\u2208N Xn\u2032 = X. For any n there is rn such that for all r \u2265 rn we have Xr \u2287 Xn\u2032 .\nClearly, for all r \u2265 rn ,\n\nR \u2264 r R \u2264 r R(x0 , x0 ) \u2264 n R\u2032 (x0 , x0 ) \u2193 R\nas n \u2192 \u221e (where n R\u2032 is the convergence parameter of Mn\u2032 = (mxy )x,y\u2208Xn\u2032 ).\nf = (mxy )x,y\u2208[x ] and M\nfn = (mxy )x,y\u2208[x\nFinally, if M is not irreducible, consider M\n\n.

Since M\n\nirreducible, the first part of the proof yields the conclusion.\n18\n\n\u0003\n\n\fNote that in the previous theorem the subsets {Xn }n\u2208N can be chosen arbitrarily; in particular\n\nthey may be finite proper subsets.\n\n5.2. Application to BRWs. Given a sequence of BRWs {(Xn , \u03bcn )}n\u2208N such that lim inf n\u2192\u221e Xn =\nP\nX, we define m(n)xy :=\nf \u2208SX f (y)\u03bcn,x (f ) and the corresponding sequence of submatrices\nn\n\n{Mn }n\u2208N of M where Mn = (m(n)xy )x,y\u2208Xn . The main goal of this section is to investigate if\nthe survival of (X, \u03bc) can guarantee the survival of (Xn , \u03bcn ) for all sufficiently large n. The fol-\n\nlowing theorem is the main result of this section; note that for all x, y \u2208 X, m(n)xy is well defined\neventually as n \u2192 \u221e. In this result we are not assuming that the BRW is irreducible.\n\nTheorem 5.2. Let us fix a vertex x0 \u2208 X. If lim inf n\u2192\u221e Xn = X and m(n)xy \u2264 mxy for all\nx, y \u2208 Xn , n \u2208 N and m(n)xy \u2192 mxy as n \u2192 \u221e then\n\n(1) (X, \u03bc) dies out locally (resp. globally) a.s. starting from x0 =\u21d2 (Xn , \u03bcn ) dies out locally\n(resp. globally) a.s starting from x0 for all n \u2208 N;\n\n(2) (X, \u03bc) survives locally wpp starting from x0 =\u21d2 (Xn , \u03bcn ) survives locally wpp starting from\nx0 eventually as n \u2192 \u221e.\nProof.\n\n(1) It follows by coupling the BRW(Xn , \u03bcn ) with the subcritical BRW(X, \u03bc) as described\nin Section 3.3.\n\n(2) Let us fix a sequence {Yn }n\u2208N of finite subsets of X q\nsuch that lim inf n\u2192\u221e Yn = X. By Theorem 4.1(1) there exists \u03b5 > 0 such that lim supi\u2192\u221e\n\ni\n\n(i)\n\nmx0 x0 > 1+ \u03b5. Consider the sequence\n\nof submatrices An = (a(n)xy )x,y\u2208Yn where a(n)xy := mxy /(1 + \u03b5). Using Theorem 5.1 we\nhave that\nlim lim sup\n\nn\u2192\u221e\n\ni\u2192\u221e\n\nq\ni\n\n(i)\na(n)x0 x0\n\n= lim sup\ni\u2192\u221e\n\nq\ni\n\n(i)\n\nmx0 x0 /(1 + \u03b5) > 1,\n\nq\ni\n(i)\nas n \u2192 \u221e. Let n\u0304 such that lim supi\u2192\u221e a(n\u0304)x0 x0 > 1. Moreover since Yn\u0304 is finite there\nexists n0 such that for all n \u2265 n0 we have m(n)xy \u2265 mxy /(1 + \u03b5) = a(n\u0304)xy for all x, y \u2208 Yn\u0304 ,\n\nthus\n\nlim sup\ni\u2192\u221e\n\nq\ni\n\n(i)\nm(n)x0 x0\n\n\u2265 lim sup\ni\u2192\u221e\n\nq\ni\n\n(i)\n\na(n\u0304)x0 x0 > 1\n\nfor all n \u2265 n0 . Theorem 4.1(1) yields the conclusion.\n\n\u0003\n\nNote that in the language of continuous-time BRWs (see [2] and [3] for details), the claim of the\nprevious theorem is \u03bbs ((Xn , \u03bcn ), x0 ) \u2192 \u03bbs ((X, \u03bc), x0 ); hence it is a generalization of [4, Theorem\n\n3.1].\n\nAmong all the possible choices of the sequence {(Xn , \u03bcn )}n\u2208N there is one which is induced by\nP\n(X, \u03bc) on the subsets {Xn }n\u2208N ; more precisely, one can take \u03bcn (g) := f \u2208SX :f |X =g \u03bcx (f ) for all\nn\n\nx \u2208 Xn and g \u2208 SXn . Roughly speaking, this choice means that all the reproductions outside Xn\n19\n\n\fare suppressed. Note that, in this case, m(n)xy = mxy for all x, y \u2208 Xn ; the result in this particular\ncase is implicitly used, for instance, in the proof of [11, Theorem 2.4].\n\nRemark 5.3. Theorem 5.2 deals mainly with local survival. One can wonder what can be said about\nglobal survival. Clearly if the (X, \u03bc) process survives globally and locally then eventually (Xn , \u03bcn )\nsurvives locally and thus globally.\nThe question is nontrivial when (X, \u03bc) survives globally but not locally, which we assume henceforth in this remark.\nIn this last case, if Xn is finite for every n \u2208 N and the graph (Xn , E\u03bcn ) is connected then there\n\nis no distinction between global and local survival for the process (Xn , \u03bcn ); in particular (Xn , \u03bcn )\ndies out (locally and globally) a.s. for all values of n \u2208 N.\n\nOn the other hand, the case where Xn is finite for every n \u2208 N and the graph (Xn , E\u03bcn ) is not\n\nconnected is more complicated and can be treated as in [3, Remark 4.4].\n\nWhen Xn is infinite for infinitely many values of n, one cannot always expect to have global\nsurvival for sufficiently large values of n. For continuous-time BRWs the counterexample can be\nconstructed using [2, Remark 3.10], hence a discrete-time counterexample would be the discrete-time\ncounterpart. Nevertheless a discrete-time counterexample can be constructed directly as follows (we\nuse the notation introduced in Section 2.1).\nFix an infinite, transitive and connected graph X and consider a reproduction law as in equation (2.3) such that the random walk {p(x, y)}x,y\u2208X has a spectral radius \u03b8 < 1. Suppose that\n\n\u03c1\u0304x = \u03c1\u0304 \u2208 (1, \u03b8 \u22121 ) is independent\nof x. Hence (see equation (2.4)) according to Theorem 4.3 there\nqP\n(n)\nis global survival since n\ny\u2208X mxy = \u03c1\u0304 > 1. On the other hand there is no local survival since,\nq\nn\n(n)\naccording to Theorem 4.1(1), lim supn\u2192\u221e mxx = \u03c1\u0304\u03b8 < 1.\n\nFix a vertex o \u2208 X, an infinite self-avoiding path \u03b3 = {xi } in X starting from o and define\n\nXn := B(o, n) \u222a \u03b3 (where B(o, n) denotes the ball with center o and radius n). Finally, consider\nthe restricted laws \u03bcn of \u03bc to Xn as described in Section 3.3.\n\nAdapting the arguments of [2, Remark 3.10], since there is no local survival in Xn and the ball\nB(o, n) is finite, one can prove that there is global survival on Xn if and only if there is global\nsurvival on the set \u03b3. Suppose now that the ray is chosen in such a way that\n\u0012\n\u0013\nmax p(x0 , x1 ), sup(p(xi , xi+1 ) + p(xi , xi\u22121 )) = \u03b1 < 1;\ni\u22651\n\n\u0001\nP\nby choosing \u03c1\u0304 \u2208 1, min(\u03b8 \u22121 , \u03b1\u22121 ) we have, by induction on n, that y\u2208\u03b3 m(n) (x, y) \u2264 \u03c1\u0304n \u03b1n and\n\nthen, according to Theorem 4.1(4), there is no global survival on \u03b3. This implies that there is no\n\nglobal survival on Xn for any n \u2208 N. An explicit example is given by the homogeneous tree with\ndegree larger than 3 with the simple random walk.\n\nA possible application of Theorem 5.2 is based on Definition 4.6. Consider an injective map K\nand suppose that \u03bc is K-invariant. If (X, E\u03bc ) is connected and there exists Y \u2286 X such that for all\n20\n\n\ffinite subsets A \u2282 X we have Xn := K (n) (Y ) \u2287 A (for some n \u2208 N) then the BRW(X, \u03bc) survives\n(locally) wpp if and only if (Y, \u03bd) survives (locally) wpp (where \u03bd is the law induced by \u03bc on Y ).\n\nIndeed, note that, if \u03bcn is the law induced by \u03bc on Xn , since \u03bc is K-invariant, the behavior of\n(Xn , \u03bcn ) is the same as the behavior of (Y, \u03bd). Clearly if (Y, \u03bd) survives then (X, \u03bc) survives. On\nthe other hand if (X, \u03bc) survives, according to Theorem 5.2, there exists a finite subset A \u2282 X\n\nsuch that the induced BRW on A survives thus, for any n such that Xn \u2287 A we have that (Xn , \u03bcn )\n\nsurvives and this implies the survival of (Y, \u03bd).\n\nThis applies, in particular, when X = Zd , \u03bcx is translation invariant and Y is a cone, namely\nY = {y \u2208 Zd : hy, y0 i \u2265 \u03b1kyk * ky0 k} for some fixed nontrivial y0 \u2208 Zd and \u03b1 < 1 (where h*, *i and\n\nk * k represent the usual scalar product and norm of Zd respectively). In this case K(x) := x \u2212 y0 .\nRoughly speaking, this means that if the BRW survives locally on Zd it must survive even when it\nis restricted to a proper subset Y as long as the collection of all the \"K-translations\" of Y cover\nthe whole space Zd .\n6. Approximation by truncated BRWs\nIn this section we want to study the approximation of a BRW {\u03b7n }n\u2208N by means of the sequence of\n\ntruncated BRWs {{\u03b7nm }n\u2208N }m\u2208N . We already know that if the BRW dies out locally (resp. globally)\n\na.s. then any truncated BRW dies out locally (resp. globally) a.s. (this can be proved by coupling\nas explained in Section 3.3). On the other hand we would like to be able to prove a result similar\nto Theorem 5.2 as m tends to infinity. For continuous-time BRWs this has been done in [4]; the\ntechnique we use here is essentially the same. From now on the set X is assumed to be countable;\nindeed, if it is finite then there is no survival for the truncated BRW {\u03b7nm }n\u2208N for any m \u2208 N.\n\nMoreover, for technical reasons we suppose that the graph (X, E\u03bc ) has finite geometry, that is,\nsupx\u2208X deg(x) < +\u221e.\nIn the following (see Step 3 below) we need to find a measure \u03c1 which dominates stochastically all\nthe measures {\u03c1x }x\u2208X (where \u03c1x is the distribution of the number of children of a particle living at\nx, see Section 2.1). It is straightforward to see that the existence of such a measure \u03c1 is equivalent\n\nto supx\u2208X \u03c1x ([n, +\u221e)) \u2192 0 as n \u2192 +\u221e (that we assume henceforth). In this case \u03c1 can be chosen\n\naccording to\n\n\u03c1(n) = sup \u03c1x ([n, +\u221e)) \u2212 sup \u03c1x ([n + 1, +\u221e)).\nx\u2208X\n\n(6.18)\n\nx\u2208X\n\nMoreover the measure \u03c1 can be chosen with finite first (resp. k-th) moment if and only if\n\u221a\nR\u221e\nP\nk\nn\u22651 supx\u2208X \u03c1x ([n, +\u221e)) < +\u221e (resp. 0 supx\u2208X \u03c1x ([ t, +\u221e))dt < +\u221e).\n\nWe assume that the matrix M is irreducible and we denote its convergence parameter by R\u03bc .\n\nWe observe that, using this notation, according to Theorem 4.1(1), local survivalqis equivalent\nqP\nn\n(n)\n(n)\nto R\u03bc < 1. Remember that, in this case, lim inf n\u2192\u221e n\nmxx do not\ny mxy and lim supn\u2192\u221e\n\ndepend on the choice of x, y \u2208 X.\n\n21\n\n\fIn the following, we need to define the product of two graphs (basically, these will be space/time\nproducts): given two graphs (X, E), (Y, E \u2032 ) we denote by (X, E) \u00d7 (Y, E \u2032 ) the weighted graph with\n\nset of vertices X \u00d7 Y and set of edges E = {((x, y), (x1 , y1 )) : (x, x1 ) \u2208 E, (y, y1 ) \u2208 E \u2032 }.\n\n6.1. The comparison with an oriented percolation. First of all, remember the coupling between {\u03b7n }n\u2208N and {\u03b7nm }n\u2208N : the truncated process {\u03b7nm }n\u2208N (satisfying equation (3.12)) can be\n\nseen as the BRW {\u03b7n }n\u2208N (satisfying equation (2.1)) by removing, at each step, all the births which\n\ncause more than m particles to live on the same site. As in [4] we need two other coupled processes.\nFix n\ne \u2208 N (which plays the same role as n0 in [4]) and let {\u03b7\u0304n }n\u2208N be the process obtained from\nthe BRW {\u03b7n }n\u2208N by removing all n-th generation particles with n > n\ne, that is\n(\n\u03b7n n \u2264 n\ne\n\u03b7\u0304n =\n0\nn>n\ne.\n\n(6.19)\n\nDefine {\u03b7\u0304nm }n\u2208N analogously from {\u03b7nm }n\u2208N .

We report here shortly the essence of\n\nthese steps and we refer to [4, Section 4] for further details.\n\n~ has a critical\nStep 1. Fix a graph (I, E(I)) such that the Bernoulli percolation on (I, E(I)) \u00d7 N\n~ the oriented graph on N, that is, (i, j) is an edge if and only\nvalue pc < 1 (where we denote by N\nif j = i + 1).\nThe usual trick is to find a copy of the graph Z or N as a subgraph of I, since the (oriented)\n~ and N \u00d7 N\n~ has two phases. In this paper, the main choices\nBernoulli bond percolation on Z \u00d7 N\nfor I are Z, N or X.\n\nStep 2. Given a globally (or locally) surviving BRW and for every \u03b5 > 0 there exists a collection\nof disjoint sets {Ai }i\u2208I (Ai \u2282 X for all i \u2208 I), n\u0304 > 0, and k \u2208 N \\ {0}, such that, for all i \u2208 I,\n\u0011\n\u0010\nX\n(6.20)\nP \u2200j : (i, j) \u2208 E(I),\n\u03b7n\u0304 (x) \u2265 k \u03b70 = \u03b7 > 1 \u2212 \u03b5,\nfor all \u03b7 such that\n\nP\n\nx\u2208Aj\n\nx\u2208Ai\n\n\u03b7(x) = k and \u03b7(x) = 0 for all x 6\u2208 Ai . The same holds, for n\ne \u2265 n\u0304, for\n\n{\u03b7\u0304n }n\u2208N in place of {\u03b7n }n\u2208N .\n\nIn the following sections Step 2 will be established under certain conditions (and for suitable\nchoices of (I, E(I))). Basically we have to prove that, for a suitable surviving BRW, with a proba-\n\nbility arbitrarily close to 1, given enough particles in Ai , after a fixed time n\u0304, we have at least the\nsame number of particles on every neighboring set Aj .\n\nIn order to understand Steps 2, 3 and 4, we describe briefly the percolation that we want to\n~ let it be open if {\u03b7 m }n\u2208N has at\nconstruct. Consider an edge ((i, l), (j, l + 1)) in (I, E(I)) \u00d7 N:\nn\n22\n\n\fleast k individuals in Ai at time ln\u0304 and in Aj at time (l + 1)n\u0304. Step 3, which follows from Step\n2, guarantees that, if m is sufficiently large, then all the edges exiting a fixed vertex are open\nwith a probability arbitrarily close to 1. Thus the probability of global survival of {\u03b7nm }n\u2208N is\n\nbounded from below by the probability that there exists an infinite cluster containing (i0 , 0) in this\n~ and, if Ai is finite, the probability of local survival is bounded from below\npercolation on I \u00d7 N,\n0\n\nby the probability that the cluster contains infinitely many points in {(i0 , l) : l \u2208 N} (we suppose\n\nto start with k particles in Ai0 ). Let \u03bd1 be the associated percolation measure. Unfortunately this\npercolation is neither independent nor one-dependent. In fact the opening procedure of the edges\n((i, n), (j, n + 1)) and ((i1 , n), (j1 , n + 1)) may depend respectively on two different progenies of\nparticles overlapping on a vertex x0 . This may cause dependence since if in x0 there are already\nm particles then newborns are not allowed. Step 4 overcomes this problem.\nStep 3. Let \u03b5, {Ai }i\u2208I , n\u0304 and k be chosen as in Step 2. Then for all sufficiently large m we have\n\nthat, for all i \u2208 I,\n\nfor all \u03b7 such that\n{\u03b7\u0304nm }n\u2208N\n\n\u0010\n\u0011\nX\nP \u2200j : (i, j) \u2208 E(I),\n\u03b7n\u0304m (x) \u2265 k \u03b70m = \u03b7 > 1 \u2212 2\u03b5,\n\nP\n\nin place of\n\n(6.21)\n\nx\u2208Aj\n\nx\u2208Ai \u03b7(x)\n{\u03b7nm }n\u2208N .\n\n= k, \u03b7(x) = 0 for all x 6\u2208 Ai . The same holds, for n\ne \u2265 n\u0304, for\n\nStep 3 follows from Step 2; the proof is a natural adaptation of the same arguments of [4, Step\n3]. Indeed let Nn be the total number of particles ever born in the BRW before time n (starting\nfrom the configuration \u03b7); it is clear that Nn is a process stochastically dominated (the arguments\nare similar to the ones we used in Section 3.3) by a branching process with offspring law\n(\n0\nn=0\n\u2032\n\u03c1 (n) :=\n\u03c1(n \u2212 1) n \u2265 1\nand initial state N0 (where \u03c1 is given by equation (6.18)). If N0 < +\u221e almost surely then for all\nn > 0 we have Nn < +\u221e almost surely; hence for all n > 0, k > 0 and \u03b5 > 0 there exists N (n, \u03b5, k)\nsuch that, for all i \u2208 I,\nP\n\n\u0010\n\u0011\nP Nn \u2264 N (n, \u03b5, k) \u03b70 = \u03b7 > 1 \u2212 \u03b5,\n\ne = N (n\u0304, \u03b5, k): in order to\n\u03b7(x) = k, \u03b7(x) = 0 for all x 6\u2208 Ai . Define N\ne = N (n\u0304, \u03b5, k) plays the same role played by n\u0304 = n(t\u0304, \u03b5)\ncompare with [4, Step 3], we observe that N\nfor all \u03b7 such that\n\nx\u2208Ai\n\nin [4]. The conclusion follows, using elementary probability arguments, as in [4, Step 3] by choosing\ne.\nm\u2265N\n\nStep 4. Given a globally (or locally) surviving BRW, for every \u03b5 > 0 and for all sufficiently large\n~ (with probability 1 \u2212 2\u03b5 of opening\nm, there exists a one-dependent oriented percolation on I \u00d7 N\n\nsimultaneously all edges from a vertex and 2\u03b5 of opening no edges) such that the probability of\nP\nsurvival of the BRWm (starting at time 0 from a configuration \u03b7 such that x\u2208Ai \u03b7(x) = k and\n0\n\n23\n\n\f\u03b7(x) = 0 for all x 6\u2208 Ai0 ) is larger than the probability that there exists an infinite cluster containing\n\n(i0 , 0).\n\nTo overcome the dependence of the \"natural\" percolation that we described above, we adapt [4,\nStep 4] to a discrete-time process: the construction is made by means of the process {\u03b7\u0304nm }n\u2208N by\ne H where N\ne is the same as in Step 3 and H is the maximum of the number of\nchoosing m \u2265 2N\n\npaths of length n\ne crossing a vertex (the assumption of bounded geometry that we made on the\ngraph plays a fundamental role here). Note that with this choice of m we have that, starting with\nP\nan initial condition \u03b70 (such that x\u2208X \u03b70 (x) = k), \u03b7nm = \u03b7n and \u03b7\u0304nm = \u03b7\u0304n for all n \u2264 n\u0304 on an event\n\nwith probability at least 1 \u2212 \u03b5 (namely, {Nn\u0304 \u2265 N (n\u0304, \u03b5, k)} as defined in Step 3). Step 4 follows\n\nthen from Step 3.\n\nOur next goals are to fix suitable graphs (I, E(I)) and prove Step 2 for a large class of globally\n\nsurviving BRWs: then by Steps 4 and 1, for all sufficiently large m, the corresponding truncated\nBRWm survives globally wpp if m is sufficiently large. On the other hand, in order to show that,\ngiven a locally surviving BRW, the corresponding truncated BRWm survives wpp if m is sufficiently\nlarge, we need to prove Step 2 with a choice of at least one Ai finite, say Ai0 , and I containing\na copy of Z or N as a subgraph. Remember that, in a supercritical Bernoulli bond percolation in\n~ or N \u00d7 N,\n~ with probability 1 the infinite open cluster has an infinite intersection with the\nZ\u00d7N\nset {(0, n) : n \u2208 N}. Thus, in the supercritical case we have, wpp, in the infinite open cluster, an\n\ninfinite number of vertices of the set {(0, n) : n \u2265 0} including the origin. This (again by Steps 3\nand 4) implies that, wpp, the BRWm starting with k particles in Ai0 has particles alive in Ai0 at\n\narbitrarily large times. Being Ai0 finite yields the conclusion.\nRemark 6.1. As in [4], the previous set of steps represents the skeleton of the proofs of Theorems\n6.5 and 6.9. In order to be able to prove Theorem 6.7 we need to modify this approach. Here\nare the main differences. We choose an oriented graph (W, E(W )) and a family of subsets of X,\n{A(i,n) }(i,n)\u2208W such that\n\n\u2022 W is a subset of the set Z \u00d7 N (the inclusion is between sets not between graphs);\n\n\u2022 for all n \u2208 N we have that {A(i,n) }i:(i,n)\u2208W is a collection of disjoint subsets of X;\n\n\u2022 (i, n) \u2192 (j, m) implies m = n + 1.\n\nStep 2 translates into the following: given a (globally or locally) surviving BRW and for every\n\u03b5 > 0, there exists n\u0304 > 0 and k \u2208 N, such that, for all n \u2208 N, i \u2208 Z, and for all \u03b7 such that\nP\nx\u2208A(i,n) \u03b7(x) = k,\n\u0011\n\u0010\nX\n\u03b7(n+1)n\u0304 (x) \u2265 k \u03b7nn\u0304 = \u03b7 > 1 \u2212 \u03b5.\nP \u2200j : (i, n) \u2192 (j, n + 1),\nx\u2208A(j,n)\n\nStep 3 is the same and the percolation in Step 4 now concerns the graph (W, E(W )).\n24\n\n\f6.2. Local survival. Let us choose a vertex o \u2208 X, fix the initial configuration as \u03b70 := \u03b4o and\nassume that the measure \u03c1 as defined by equation (6.18) has finite second moment. The key to prove\n\nStep 2 is based on some estimates on the expected value E\u03b4o (\u03b7n (x)) of the number of individuals\n(n)\n\nin a site. This expected value can be computed using equation (2.2): hence E\u03b4o (\u03b7n (x)) = mo,x . It\nis clear that\n\n(\n0\nif R\u03bc > 1,\nlim E\u03b4o (\u03b7n (x)) =\nn\u2192\u221e\n+\u221e if R\u03bc < 1.\n\n(6.22)\n\nIn the following lemma we prove that, when R\u03bc < 1, if at time 0 we have one individual at\neach of the sites x1 , . . . , xl , then, given any choice of l sites y1 , . . . , yl , after some time the expected\nnumber of descendants in yi of the individual in xi exceeds any fixed D \u2265 1 for all i = 1, . . . , l. The\nproof follows immediately from equation (6.22) we omit it; just note that, due to equation (6.19),\nthe estimate on E\u03b4xj (\u03b7\u0304n (yj )) follows immediately from the one on E\u03b4xj (\u03b7n (yj )).\nLemma 6.2.

Moreover, E\u03b4xj (\u03b7\u0304n (yj )) > 1 when\n\nn\ne > n.\n\nWe show that, when R\u03bc < 1, for all sufficiently large k \u2208 N, given k particles in a site x at\n\ntime 0, \"typically\" (i.e. with arbitrarily large probability) after some time we will have at least Dk\n\nindividuals in each site of a fixed finite set Y . Analogously, starting with l colonies of size k (in\nsites x1 , . . . , xl respectively), each of them will spread, after a sufficiently long time, at least Dk\ndescendants in every site of a corresponding (finite) set of sites Yi .\nLemma 6.3.

We know that,\n27\n\n\fif {\u03b7n }n\u2208N is a realization of (X, \u03bc) then a realization of (I, \u03bd) is given by the projection (on I)\n{\u03ben }n\u2208N where \u03ben = \u03c0g (\u03b7n ) for all n \u2208 N. Clearly \u03bdg(x) (*) = \u03bcx (g\u22121 (*)) and we can easily compute\n\nthe expected number of particles alive at time n in Ai starting from a single particle alive in x at\ntime 0 as\nX\n\n\u03b4\n\nE\u03b4\u03bcx (\u03b7n (z)) = E\u03bdf (x) (\u03ben (i)).\n\n(6.23)\n\nz\u2208Ai\n\nSince {\u03b7nm }n\u2208N and {\u03c0g (\u03b7nm )}n\u2208N have the same global behavior and {\u03c0g (\u03b7nm )}n\u2208N stochastically\ndominates {\u03benm }n\u2208N then if the latter survives globally wpp then {\u03b7nm }n\u2208N survives globally wpp.\n\nFollowing the previous remark, we take I = Z, X = Z \u00d7 Y (for some set Y ) and we denote by\n\ng : X \u2192 Z the usual projection from X onto Z, namely g(n, y) := n.\n\nWe suppose that \u03bd is translation invariant and we denote by \u03c1 and \u03c1\u0304 =\n\nP\n\ny\u2208X\n\nmxy =\n\nP\n\ne g(x)j\nj\u2208Z m\n\nthe distribution and the expected number of offsprings of {\u03b7n }n\u2208N respectively (where, according\n\nto the notation of Section 3, m\ne ij is the expected number of offsprings in j of a particle in i of\n\nthe projected BRW {\u03ben }n\u2208N ). We note that, since \u03c1 and \u03c1\u0304 are the distribution and the expected\n\nnumber of offsprings of \u03bd as well, they do not depend on x \u2208 X or i \u2208 Z since \u03bd is translation\n\ninvariant. The following Theorem is the discrete-time analogous of [4, Theorem 6.1].\n\nTheorem 6.7. Let X = Z \u00d7 Y and suppose that the BRW (X, \u03bc) is locally isomorphic to (Z, \u03bd)\nwhere \u03bd is translation invariant. If mxy = 0 whenever |g(x) \u2212 g(y)| > 1 then\nP\n(1) the BRW survives globally starting from x if and only if \u03c1\u0304 = y\u2208Z mxy > 1;\n\n(2) if the BRW survives globally (starting from x) then {\u03b7nm }n\u2208N survives globally (starting from\nx) provided that m is sufficiently large.\n\nProof.\n\n(1) This follows from Theorem 4.3 since (X, \u03bc) is an F-BRW which can be mapped onto\nP\n(n)\nthe branching processes with offspring distribution \u03c1 and recalling that y\u2208Z mxy = \u03c1\u0304n .\n\n(2) According to Remark 6.6 it is enough to prove the claim for the BRW {\u03ben }n\u2208N where\n\u03ben = \u03c0g (\u03b7n ) whose diffusion matrix satisfies\n\n\uf8f1\np\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2q\nm\ne ij =\n\uf8f41 \u2212 p \u2212 q\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\n0\n\nj =i+1\nj =i\u22121\ni=j\notherwise.\n\nfor some p, q \u2208 [0, 1] (p + q \u2264 1).\n\nHere is an alternative proof which does not involve Remark 6.6. Following the general\n\nversion of Step 2 (see Remark 6.1), we define A(i,n) = g\u22121 (i) and we fix \u03b1, \u03b2 \u2208 (0, 1) such\n28\n\n\fthat \u03b1 < \u03b2 < (1 + \u03b1)/2.

Fix an end \u03c4 in Tr and a root o \u2208 X and define the map h : X \u2192 Z as the usual height (see\n[27, Section 12.13]). Let Ak = h\u22121 (k) as k \u2208 Z (these sets are usually referred to as horocycles).\n\nSince \u03bc is invariant with respect to every automorphism then we have, as before, that Tr = Z \u00d7 Z\nis locally isomorphic to (Z, \u03bd) where the projection \u03bd is translation invariant.\n\n\u0003\n7. Final remarks\nThe paper is devoted to three main issues: finding conditions for the local (resp. global) survival\nof the process, discussing the spatial approximation and, finally, studying the approximation by\nmeans of truncated BRWs. This has been done for continuous BRWs in [2, q\n3, 4].\nP\n(n)\nn\nAbout the first issue, a question was left open in [3], namely if lim inf n\u2192\u221e\ny mxy > 1 implies\nglobal survival starting from x. This suggests a more general question: does the global behavior\n\ndepend only on the first-moment matrix M ? We know by Theorem 4.1(1) that the local behavior of\na discrete-time BRW depends only on M . Moreover, in [3] has been proved that for a continuoustime BRW there is a characterization in terms of a functional inequality of the global survival and\nthis inequality depends only on the matrix M , namely\n\u2203v \u2208 [0, 1] : v(x0 ) > 0, M v \u2265\n\nv\n1\u2212v\n\n(7.25)\n\nif and only if there is global survival starting from x0 (again, the ratio in the right hand side is\ntaken coordinatewise). Hence, for a continuous-time BRW, both the local and global behaviors\nare completely determined by the first-moment matrix of the process. Nevertheless, according to\nExample 4.4, one cannot expect to find an equivalent condition to global survival for a discretetime BRW involving only the first-moment matrix M . Of course it is still possible to find either\n30\n\n\fsufficient or necessary conditions for the global survival which are similar to equation (7.25), but\nthis goes beyond the aim of this paper.\nMore work can still be done in the direction of understanding the strong local survival by using\nthe infinite-dimensional generating function G; what we did in Section 4.2 is just a beginning.\nAs for the spatial approximation, the results of Section 5 are quite satisfactory. On the other\nhand, there is room for improvements in the approximations by truncated BRWs of Section 6.\nIndeed, one can hope to find more classes of BRWs which can be approximated by their truncations.\nIn our results a key role was played by the similarity of the BRW under suitable automorphisms of\nthe graph (such as translations, for instance), nevertheless the four steps described in Section 6.1\n(see also [4, Section 5]) are quite general and could be applied to a variety of classes of BRWs,\nprovided one can prove Step 2 (as we did in Sections 6.2 and 6.3, possibly using different techniques).\nFinally, some of our results can be applied in a natural way to BRWs in random environment\n(as in [4, Section 7]) but, again, this goes beyond the purpose of the paper.\nAcknowledgments\nThe author is grateful to the referees for many helpful suggestions.\nReferences\n[1] K.B.
