Solitons occur in such diverse\nareas as hydrodynamics, plasma and solid state physics, as well as in general\nrelativity [1, 2, 3]. They have important current technological applications in\noptical fibre communication systems and Josephson junction superconducting\ndevices [4, 5]. Nonlinear equations which describe solitonic phenomena (integrable systems) are ubiquitous and of great mathematical interest. Thus, in particular, they are generically amenable to the Inverse Scattering Transform (IST)\nmethod [6, 7] and admit invariance under B\u00e4cklund transformations [8, 9] with\nassociated nonlinear superposition principles (permutability theorems) whereby\nanalytic expressions descriptive of multi-soliton interaction may be constructed.\nHere, it demonstrated that there exists a deep connection between discrete integrable systems and reciprocal figures of graphical statics (structural\n\u2020 Permanent address: Dipartimento di Fisica, Universit\u00e0 di Lecce and Sezione INFN, 73100\nLecce, Italy\n\n1\n\n\fgeometry). The theory of reciprocal figures was developed by the physicist\nand geometer James Clerk Maxwell in the XIXth century in connection with\ndiagrams of forces representing stresses in frameworks [10]. Maxwell's contributions [11] culminated in the paper On reciprocal figures, frames and diagrams of\nforces [12] for which he received the Keith Prize of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. However, Maxwell points out that the construction of diagrams of forces\nin which each force is represented by one line had been discovered independently and earlier by the practical draughtsman W.P. Taylor and he also refers\nto William Rankine's Applied Mechanics [13]. Subsequently, in [14], Fleeming\nJenkin gave a variety of practical applications of reciprocal figures to the calculation of strains on frameworks. He received the Keith Gold Medal for his paper\nOn the application of graphic methods to the determination of the efficiency of\nmachinery [15]. His contribution Bridges to the Encyclopaedia Britannica [16]\ncontains reciprocal figures associated with a variety of bridges including suspension bridges. References to the relevant literature of this period may be found in\nLuigi Cremona's two treatises Le Figure Reciproche Nella Statica Grafica [17].\nIt is interesting to note that Karl Culmann in his Graphische Statik [18]\nmakes great use of diagrams of forces, some of which are reciprocal. Culmann's\nstudent Maurice Koechling, in turn, was one of two chief engineers in Gustave\nEiffel's company and carried out in a graphical manner many calculations for\nthe Eiffel Tower built in 1889. Remarkably, a century later, Maxwell's observation that there exists a close relationship between plane rectilinear reciprocal\nfigures and perspective representations of closed polyhedra was rediscovered in\nthe context of 'artificial intelligence', namely the recognition and 'realizability'\nof plane line drawings as three-dimensional polyhedral scenes [19, 20].\nThe connection with integrable systems is made by identifying the geometric\ncompatibility which guarantees the existence of reciprocal figures with the algebraic compatibility of linear difference equations which give rise to nonlinear\nintegrable difference equations. We begin with the simplest pair of reciprocal\nfigures, namely reciprocal triangles. It is demonstrated that the dilation coefficients which encode the reciprocal relation between the two triangles satisfy the\nintegrable discrete BKP equation. The discrete BKP (dBKP) equation is known\nto encapsulate the entire B-type Kadomtsev-Petviashvili hierarchy of integrable\nequations [21] and may also be regarded as a nonlinear superposition principle\nfor eight solutions of this hierarchy generated by B\u00e4cklund transformations [22].\nThe vertices of the reciprocal triangles and their 'interior points' are shown to\nobey a simple 8-point relation which is likewise integrable and may be regarded\nas a 'Schwarzian' version of the dBKP equation. Since this 8-point relation is\nformulated in terms of two cross-ratios, it is invariant under the group of inversive transformations, that is M\u00f6bius transformations and complex conjugation.\nThis observation is used to formulate reciprocity in a purely inversive geometric\nmanner. Thus, the Schwarzian BKP equation constitutes a natural object of\ninversive geometry.\nIntegrable lattices on the complex plane consisting of reciprocal triangles and\ntheir 'circle geometric' extensions are defined in terms of pairs of face-centred cubic (fcc) lattices and it is shown that there exist canonical geometric reductions\n2\n\n\fwhich are associated with the discrete analogue of Darboux's 2+1-dimensional\nsine-Gordon equation set down in [23] and the discrete Tzitz\u00e9ica equation which\nhas been obtained earlier in both an algebraic and purely geometric manner [24]-[27]. We discuss another class of reciprocal figures which is obtained\nvia a 'truncation' of Maxwell's example of an 'octahedral' figure [10]. Once\nagain, it is shown that the pair of reciprocal figures so obtained may be considered 'integrable'. We conclude the paper with a discussion of Maxwell's\ncomplete octahedral figure and determine a canonical class of hexahedral reciprocals which may be defined in terms of multi-ratio relations. This class is\nthen shown to be associated with integrable lattices of octahedral-hexahedral\ncombinatorics.\nIn an earlier paper [28], we established a connection between the Schwarzian\nKadomtsev-Petviashvili hierarchy and Menelaus' fundamental theorem of plane\ngeometry. Therein, we first set down the discrete Schwarzian KP equation in the\ncontext of soliton theory and then interpreted it geometrically. Here, we adopt\nan inverse procedure. We discuss the geometry of reciprocal figures and then\nretrieve discrete integrable systems and their associated hierarchies. This is to\nunderline the intimate relation between canonical hierarchies of soliton theory\nand plane configurations in inversive geometry.\n\n2\n\nReciprocal figures, frames and diagrams of\nforces\n\nSome 140 years ago, James Clerk Maxwell [10] discovered a fascinating connection between planar reciprocal figures, diagrams of forces and orthogonal\nprojections of polyhedra. Subsequently, Jenkin [14, 15] applied diagrams of\nforces and reciprocal figures to the most important cases occurring in practice\nat the time. Other names associated with the theory of graphical statics and, in\nparticular, reciprocal diagrams of forces are Bow, Culmann, Cremona, Rankine\nand W.P. Taylor [13, 17, 18, 29]. Maxwell's geometric definition of a frame is\na system of straight lines connecting a number of points. These lines may be\nthought of as material pieces such as beams, rods or wires and the forces which\nact on each piece joining two points may be interpreted as two forces of the\nsame magnitude but opposite direction acting between the two points.\nThe simplest frame consists of four points joined by six lines as displayed\nin Figure 1(a). One may now inquire as to whether there exist forces acting\non the points along the lines such that the frame is in equilibrium. Figure 1(a)\ndepicts six forces and their counterparts which are parallel to the lines. In order\nto verify that the frame is in equilibrium, it must be possible to rearrange any\nthree force vectors which act on a point in such a way that they form a closed\npolygon. Figure 1(b) indicates that the four polygons of forces associated with\nthe points 1, 2, 3 and 4 are indeed closed. Thus, the frame is in equilibrium and\nany other forces which guarantee equilibrium must be multiples of those drawn\nin Figure 1(a). Hence, the ratios and the directions of the forces are determined.\n\n3\n\n\f(b)\n2\n(a)\n\n3\n3\n\n4\n1\n\n7\n4\n8\n\n2\n\n1\n\n6\n\n(c)\n\n5\n\nFigure 1: A frame and its reciprocal diagram of forces\nNow, the crucial observation is that the four polygons of forces may be fitted\ntogether to form another frame. This is depicted in Figure 1(c). Consequently,\nit is also possible to interpret the directed lines connecting the points 1, 2, 3\nand 4 as force vectors which act on the points of the second frame in such a way\nthat equilibrium is maintained. Hence, the two figures 1(a) and 1(c) constitute\nreciprocal figures. Maxwell gave a beautiful geometric construction of the second\nframe (cf. Figure 2). Thus, if we draw four circles passing through any three\npoints of the original figure then the line segments which connect the centres of\nthese four circumcircles are orthogonal to the six lines and form another figure\nconsisting of four points and six lines. If we rotate this figure by 90 degrees then\na reciprocal figure is obtained. This figure is definite in size and position but\nany figure similar to it is still reciprocal to the original figure.\nIt has been seen that the reciprocal of a figure of the type 1(a) is uniquely\ndetermined up to a scaling and its position on the plane. Based on the following\ndefinition, Maxwell [10] investigated in detail the conditions of indeterminateness and impossibility in drawing reciprocal figures:\nDefinition 1 (Maxwell (1864)). Two plane figures are reciprocal when they\nconsist of an equal number of lines, so that corresponding lines in the two figures\nare parallel, and corresponding lines which converge to a point in one figure form\na closed polygon in the other.\nHe first analysed this problem in an algebraic manner. Thus, the construction\nof the reciprocal of Figure 1(a) is possible and unique because the number of\npoints equals the number of polygons in this figure. Figure 3(a) displays a figure\nof 'octahedral' combinatorics. The number of polygons exceeds the number of\npoints by two. Accordingly, the construction of a reciprocal figure is possible but\nthere exist two degrees of freedom. This is reflected in the following construction\nof the reciprocal figure. We first draw three concurrent lines which are parallel to\nthe edges 1, 4 and 5 and arbitrarily choose a point on each line. The remainder\nof the reciprocal figure is then uniquely determined by drawing successively lines\n4\n\n\fFigure 2: Geometric construction of reciprocal triangles\nparallel to the edges 2, 12, 3, 11, 6, 7, 9 and 8. The latter two lines and the line\nwhich is parallel to the edge 10 and passes through the intersection of the lines\nparallel to the edges 6 and 7 may be shown to be concurrent. Hence, in addition\nto a scaling, the reciprocal figure is indeed capable of two degrees of variability.\nIt is noted that the reciprocal figures 3 have the combinatorics of an octahedron\nand a cube respectively.\nThe construction of the reciprocal figure 3(b) shows that if we begin with\na figure of the combinatorics of Figure 3(b) then it is not always possible to\nconstruct a reciprocal. Indeed, there exist two conditions on the directions of\nthe lines which are required to hold. From a physical point of view, this implies\nthat if these conditions are satisfied then the frame is able to support forces.\nHowever, any small variation of the frame may instantly lead to instability.\nMaxwell realized that these conditions are elegantly expressed by the fact that\nFigure 3(b) constitutes an orthogonal projection of a closed polyhedron with\nplanar faces. Remarkably, he proved in a constructive manner that any plane\nfigure which may be regarded as an orthogonal projection of a three-dimensional\npolyhedron with planar faces admits a reciprocal and may therefore be identified\nwith a frame which is in equilibrium. Indeed, let a plane figure be the orthogonal\nprojection of a polyhedron and draw concurrent lines which are parallel to the\nnormals to the faces of the polyhedron. The points of intersection with the\nplane on which the figure lies define another plane figure if we join by a line any\ntwo points which are associated with two adjacent faces. By construction, the\nlines of the second figure will be orthogonal to the corresponding lines of the\noriginal figure. Rotation by 90 degrees then produces a reciprocal figure.\n\n5\n\n\f11\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n4\n8\n\n3\n7\n\n6\n\n7\n\n10\n3\n\n1\n\n2\n\n10\n8\n9\n6\n\n11\n\n2\n\n12\n4\n\n5\n\n5\n\n9\n12\n\n1\n\nFigure 3: 'Indeterminate' or 'conditionally' reciprocal figures\nThe converse of Maxwell's theorem is not strictly true. It is not difficult\nto find plane figures which admit reciprocals but are not related to spatial\npolyhedra in the above-mentioned manner and frames which are in equilibrium\nbut do not have (proper) reciprocal diagrams of forces. Nevertheless, if one\nmakes the assumption that the combinatorics of the frame is that of a spherical\npolyhedron then the existence of a reciprocal, a spatial polyhedron and a selfstress (that is, a frame in equilibrium) are equivalent [30].\nIn view of the following, it is now useful to return to the construction of the\n'reciprocal triangles' displayed in Figure 1. Thus, given a figure of the type 1(a),\nwe first draw three lines which are parallel to the edges (1, 4), (2, 4) and (3, 4)\nand denote the points of intersection by 5, 6 and 7 as shown in Figure 1(c). The\ntwo lines which pass through the points 5 and 7 and are parallel to the edges\n(1, 3) and (2, 3) respectively determine the point 8. The existence of the reciprocal figure then guarantees that the line which passes through 5 and 8 is indeed\nparallel to the edge (1, 2). The phenomenom that during the construction of\nreciprocal figures certain lines turn out to be concurrent (cf. the construction\nof Figure 3(b)) provides the key to the link with integrable systems. Thus, in\nthe following, we set in correspondence this geometric compatibility of reciprocal figures with the algebraic compatibility of linear systems defining discrete\nintegrable systems.\n\n3\n\nReciprocal triangles, dilations and an 8-point\nrelation\n\nIn this section, we investigate in detail the geometric and algebraic properties\nof the simplest reciprocal figures, namely reciprocal triangles. In order to reveal\nconnections with both inversive geometry and soliton theory, it proves convenient to complement Maxwell's geometric construction with a purely algebraic\nproof of the existence of reciprocal triangles.

If \u2206(\u03a61 , \u03a62 , \u03a63 ) constitutes a triangle with edges (\u03a61 , \u03a62 ), (\u03a62 , \u03a63 ), (\u03a63 , \u03a61 ) being parallel to the\nline segments (\u03a6, \u03a612 ), (\u03a6, \u03a623 ), (\u03a6, \u03a613 ) respectively then the two triangles are\nreciprocal\u2020 if there exists a point \u03a6123 such that the line segments (\u03a61 , \u03a6123 ),\n(\u03a62 , \u03a6123 ), (\u03a63 , \u03a6123 ) are parallel to the edges (\u03a613 , \u03a612 ), (\u03a612 , \u03a623 ), (\u03a623 , \u03a613 )\nrespectively as indicated in Figure 4. It turns out convenient to identify the\nplane with the complex plane and regard \u03a6, . . . , \u03a6123 as complex numbers.\nAccordingly, by assumption, there exist real dilation coefficients a, b, c such that\n\u03a612 \u2212 \u03a6 = c(\u03a61 \u2212 \u03a62 )\n\u03a623 \u2212 \u03a6 = a(\u03a62 \u2212 \u03a63 )\n\n(3.1)\n\n\u03a613 \u2212 \u03a6 = b(\u03a63 \u2212 \u03a61 )\nand the reciprocity condition amounts to the existence of a complex number\n\u03a6123 \u2208 C and three real dilations a1 , b2 , c3 \u2208 R obeying the algebraic system\n\u03a6123 \u2212 \u03a63 = c3 (\u03a613 \u2212 \u03a623 )\n\u03a6123 \u2212 \u03a61 = a1 (\u03a612 \u2212 \u03a613 )\n\n(3.2)\n\n\u03a6123 \u2212 \u03a62 = b2 (\u03a623 \u2212 \u03a612 ).\nNow, any of the relations (3.2) may be regarded as a definition for \u03a6123 and elimination of \u03a6123 from (3.2)1,2 and (3.2)2,3 leads, on use of (3.1), to the necessary\nand sufficient conditions\n(1 + c3 b + a1 b + c3 a)(\u03a61 \u2212 \u03a63 ) = (c3 a \u2212 a1 c)(\u03a61 \u2212 \u03a62 )\n(1 + a1 c + b2 c + a1 b)(\u03a62 \u2212 \u03a61 ) = (a1 b \u2212 b2 a)(\u03a62 \u2212 \u03a63 ).\n\n(3.3)\n\n\u2020 It is noted that it is justified to use the term reciprocal triangles without referring to the\npoints \u03a6 and \u03a6123 since the latter are uniquely determined by the edges of the two triangles.\n\n7\n\n\fSince the triangles are assumed to be non-degenerate, the real coefficients in (3.3)\nmust vanish. If these four conditions on the dilations were independent then\nthere would exist a constraint on the dilations a, b, c and therefore the second\ntriangle. However, Maxwell's geometric construction implies that this is not the\ncase and, indeed, one condition turns out to be redundant. The remaining three\nconditions define the dilations a1 , b2 , c3 . Thus, the existence of the reciprocal\ntriangle is guaranteed and, as a consequence, we may formulate the following\ntheorem:\nTheorem 1 (Algebraic description of reciprocal triangles).\nIf \u2206(\u03a623 , \u03a613 , \u03a612 ) and \u2206(\u03a61 , \u03a62 , \u03a63 ) constitute reciprocal triangles with 'interior points' \u03a6 and \u03a6123 respectively then the dilations a, b, c and a1 , b2 , c3 as\ndefined by (3.1) and (3.2) respectively are related by\na\nb\nc\n, b2 = \u2212\n, c3 = \u2212\n.\n(3.4)\nab + bc + ca\nab + bc + ca\nab + bc + ca\nConversely, let \u03a61 , \u03a62 , \u03a63 and \u03a6 be four generic points on the complex plane,\na, b, c \u2208 R be arbitrary non-vanishing real numbers and a1 , b2 , c3 be given by (3.4).\nThen, the unique solution of the compatible linear system (3.1), (3.2) gives\nrise to the reciprocal triangles \u2206(\u03a623 , \u03a613 , \u03a612 ) and \u2206(\u03a61 , \u03a62 , \u03a63 ) with 'interior points' \u03a6 and \u03a6123 respectively.\na1 = \u2212\n\nThe second part of the above theorem expresses the fact that reciprocal triangles may be constructed in the following way: Given four points \u03a61 , \u03a62 , \u03a63 ,\n\u03a6 on the complex plane and three real numbers a, b, c, we draw three line\nsegments (\u03a6, \u03a623 ), (\u03a6, \u03a613 ), (\u03a6, \u03a612 ) which are parallel to the edges (\u03a62 , \u03a63 ),\n(\u03a63 , \u03a61 ), (\u03a61 , \u03a62 ) and their lengths are determined by the dilations a, b, c respectively. The lines which pass through the vertices \u03a61 , \u03a62 , \u03a63 and are parallel\nto the line segments (\u03a613 , \u03a612 ), (\u03a612 , \u03a623 ), (\u03a623 , \u03a613 ) respectively then meet at\na point \u03a6123 with associated dilations a1 , b2 , c3 given by (3.4).\nThe relations (3.4) imply that, for instance, c3 a = a1 c (cf. (3.3)). Hence, on\nexpressing the dilations a, c, a1 , c3 in terms of \u03a6, . . . , \u03a6123 by means of (3.1), (3.2)\nand rearranging terms, we are led to the following observation:\nCorollary 1 (An 8-point relation). The quadruplets \u03a61 , \u03a62 , \u03a63 , \u03a6123 and\n\u03a623 , \u03a613 , \u03a612 , \u03a6 associated with two reciprocal triangles satisfy the 8-point relation\n(\u03a61 \u2212 \u03a62 )(\u03a63 \u2212 \u03a6123 )\n(\u03a623 \u2212 \u03a613 )(\u03a612 \u2212 \u03a6)\n=\n,\n(3.5)\n(\u03a62 \u2212 \u03a63 )(\u03a6123 \u2212 \u03a61 )\n(\u03a613 \u2212 \u03a612 )(\u03a6 \u2212 \u03a623 )\nthat is\nQ(\u03a61 , \u03a62 , \u03a63 , \u03a6123 ) = Q(\u03a623 , \u03a613 , \u03a612 , \u03a6),\n(3.6)\nwhere the cross-ratio Q of four points on the complex plane is defined as usual by\nQ(P1 , P2 , P3 , P4 ) =\n\n(P1 \u2212 P2 )(P3 \u2212 P4 )\n.\n(P2 \u2212 P3 )(P4 \u2212 P1 )\n\n(3.7)\n\nIt is noted that, by construction and due to the symmetries of the cross-ratio,\nthe above 8-point relation is invariant under any simultaneous permutation of\nthe arguments of the two cross-ratios.\n8\n\n\f4\n\nInversive geometry of reciprocal triangles\n\nIn the preceding, it has been shown that reciprocal triangles provide particular\nsolutions of the 8-point relation (3.5). This observation suggests that there\nshould exist a complete geometric characterization of the 8-point relation in\nterms of reciprocal triangles if the latter are appropriately generalized. To this\nend, it is natural to adopt a wider definition of reciprocal figures (as suggested\nby Maxwell). Thus, two triangles are reciprocally related if corresponding pairs\nof edges are not necessarily parallel but meet at the same angle. In other words,\nrelative rotations of the triangles are admissible and hence reciprocal triangles\nare characterized by the equality of corresponding angles as shown in Figure 4.\nSince the cross-ratio of four points on the complex plane is preserved by\nM\u00f6bius transformations\n\u00e3\u03c8 + b\u0303\n(4.1)\n\u03c8 \u2192 \u03c8\u2032 =\nc\u0303\u03c8 + d \u0303\nwith \u00e3d \u0303 \u2212 b\u0303c\u0303 6= 0, it is evident that the 8-point relation is invariant under what\nmay be referred to as local M\u00f6bius transformations acting independently on the\nquadruplets \u03a61 , \u03a62 , \u03a63 , \u03a6123 and \u03a623 , \u03a613 , \u03a612 , \u03a6. Consequently, the 8-point\nrelation is preserved by global M\u00f6bius transformations which act on the complex plane and therefore simultaneously on both quadruplets. In addition, the\n8-point relation is seen to be invariant under complex conjugation. Thus, the\n8-point relation turns out to be preserved by the group of inversive transformations which consists of M\u00f6bius transformations and complex conjugation and\nmaps (generalized) circles to (generalized) circles [31, 32]. Particular inversive\ntransformations include translations, scalings, rotations and inversions in a line\nor circle. The latter are represented by\n\u03c8 \u2192 \u03c8\u2032 = \u03c8\u2217 +\n\nr2\n,\n\u03c8\u0304 \u2212 \u03c8\u0304 \u2217\n\n(4.2)\n\nwhere r and \u03c8 \u2217 denote the radius and centre of a circle respectively. It is noted\nthat inversive transformations may be decomposed into inversions. Accordingly,\nthe 8-point relation constitutes an object of inversive geometry which, in the\nspirit of Klein, is concerned with those properties of figures on the plane which\nare preserved by inversive transformations [31]-[33].\nThe above analysis of the symmetry group of the 8-point relation shows that\na canonical definition of reciprocity is required to allow for the global group\nof inversive transformations and local group of M\u00f6bius transformations. It is\ntherefore natural to adopt the following definition:\nDefinition 2 (Reciprocal (4, 6) configurations). A configuration consisting of four points on the complex plane which are linked by six circular arcs\nis termed a (4, 6) configuration if the circular extensions of the arcs meet at a\npoint (cf. Figure 5). Two (4, 6) configurations are said to be reciprocally related\nif the six angles made by the circular arcs of one (4, 6) configuration equal those\nof the other (4, 6) configuration in the manner indicated in Figures 5 and 6.\n9\n\n\f\u03a613\n\u03b2\u0303 \u03b2\n\n\u03b2\u2032\n\u03b3\n\n\u03b3\u0303\n\n\u03b1\u2032\n\u03a6 \u03b3\u2032\n\n\u03b1\n\n\u03b1\u0303\n\u03a623\n\n\u03a612\n\n\u03a6\u2217\n\nFigure 5: A (4, 6) configuration\nIt is evident that, by construction, (4, 6) configurations are images under\ninversive transformations of four points linked by six straight line segments. As\na consequence, the angles in any of the four triangles made by three circular arcs\nadd up to \u03c0. If the circular arcs of two reciprocal (4, 6) configurations degenerate to straight line segments then the usual definition of reciprocal triangles is\nretrieved. The generalization of Corollary 1 is now the following:\nTheorem 2 (Inversive geometry of the 8-point relation). Two quadruplets (\u03a61 , \u03a62 , \u03a63 , \u03a6123 ) and (\u03a623 , \u03a613 , \u03a612 , \u03a6) of complex numbers may be regarded as the vertices of two reciprocal (4, 6) configurations if and only if the\n8-point relation\nQ(\u03a61 , \u03a62 , \u03a63 , \u03a6123 ) = Q(\u03a623 , \u03a613 , \u03a612 , \u03a6)\n\n(4.3)\n\nholds.\nProof. On the one hand, consider two reciprocal (4, 6) configurations with\nvertices \u03a61 , \u03a62 , \u03a63 , \u03a6123 and \u03a623 , \u03a613 , \u03a612 , \u03a6 respectively. If we apply two local\nM\u00f6bius transformations which map the two points of intersection \u03a6\u2217 and \u03a6\u2032\u2217 to\ninfinity (cf. Figures 5 and 6) then two reciprocal triangles are obtained. Since\nthe cross-ratios associated with the two (4, 6) configurations are preserved by\nlocal M\u00f6bius transformations, Corollary 1 implies that the 8-point relation (4.3)\nis satisfied.\nOn the other hand, let the 8-point relation be satisfied and choose an arbitrary point \u03a6\u2217 . Then, by drawing circles through \u03a6\u2217 and any two of the points\n\u03a623 , \u03a613 , \u03a612 , \u03a6, a (4, 6) configuration is obtained. The circles passing through\nthe point \u03a6 meet at some angles \u03b1\u2032 , \u03b2 \u2032 and \u03b3 \u2032 as indicated in Figure 5. Here,\nwe regard angles as oriented quantities. Another (4, 6) configuration is now\nconstructed in the following way: If \u03bb, \u03bc, \u03bd denote the angles made by the line\nsegments (\u03a61 , \u03a62 ), (\u03a62 , \u03a63 ), (\u03a63 , \u03a61 ) then we may draw three circles which pass\nthrough the pairs {\u03a62 , \u03a63 }, {\u03a63 , \u03a61 }, {\u03a61 , \u03a62 } and meet these line segments at\n10\n\n\f\u03a63\n\n\u03b3\u2032\n\n\u03b2\u0302 \u03b1\u0303 \u03b1\u0302\n\u03bd\n\n\u03b1\n\u03a6123\n\n\u03b3\n\n\u03b2\n\u03bc\n\n\u03b2\u0302\n\u03b2\u0303 \u03bb\n\n\u03b1\u2032\n\n\u03b2 \u2032 \u03b3\u0303\n\u03b3\u0302\n\n\u03b1\u0302\n\u03a62\n\n\u03b3\u0302\n\n\u03a61\n\n\u03a6\u2032\u2217\n\nFigure 6: A reciprocal (4, 6) configuration\nangles \u03b1\u0302 = \u03b1\u2032 \u2212 \u03bb, \u03b2\u0302 = \u03b2 \u2032 \u2212 \u03bc, \u03b3\u0302 = \u03b3 \u2032 \u2212 \u03bd as shown in Figure 6. By construction, these circles meet at angles \u03b1\u2032 , \u03b2 \u2032 , \u03b3 \u2032 . Since \u03b1\u2032 + \u03b2 \u2032 + \u03b3 \u2032 = \u03c0, the three\ncircles intersect at a point, \u03a6\u2032\u2217 , say. Finally, another three circles S1 , S2 , S3 are\ndefined by the requirement that they pass through the pairs {\u03a61 , \u03a6\u2032\u2217 }, {\u03a62 , \u03a6\u2032\u2217 },\n{\u03a63 , \u03a6\u2032\u2217 } and meet the other three circles at angles \u03b1\u0303, \u03b2\u0303, \u03b3\u0303 which are defined\nin Figure 5. We now apply two local M\u00f6bius transformations which map the\npoints \u03a6\u2217 and \u03a6\u2032\u2217 to infinity and the twelve circles to twelve straight lines. The\nexistence theorem of reciprocal triangles then implies that the images of the\ncircles S1 , S2 , S3 are concurrent and hence the circles S1 , S2 , S3 intersect at a\npoint \u03a6\u25e6\u25e6\u25e6 , say. Thus, the quadruplets (\u03a61 , \u03a62 , \u03a63 , \u03a6\u25e6\u25e6\u25e6 ) and (\u03a623 , \u03a613 , \u03a612 , \u03a6)\nof points constitute the vertices of two reciprocal (4, 6) configurations and hence\nQ(\u03a61 , \u03a62 , \u03a63 , \u03a6\u25e6\u25e6\u25e6 ) = Q(\u03a623 , \u03a613 , \u03a612 , \u03a6).\n\n(4.4)\n\nHowever, since, by assumption, the 8-point relation (4.3) is likewise satisfied, it\nis concluded that \u03a6\u25e6\u25e6\u25e6 = \u03a6123 . This completes the proof.\nAnother algebraic description of reciprocal (4, 6) configurations is obtained\nby introducing complex dilations a, b, c and a1 , b2 , c3 according to\n\u03a612 \u2212 \u03a6 = c(\u03a61 \u2212 \u03a62 )\n\u03a623 \u2212 \u03a6 = a(\u03a62 \u2212 \u03a63 )\n\u03a613 \u2212 \u03a6 = b(\u03a63 \u2212 \u03a61 )\n\n11\n\n(4.5)\n\n\fand\n\n\u03a6123 \u2212 \u03a63 = c3 (\u03a613 \u2212 \u03a623 )\n\u03a6123 \u2212 \u03a61 = a1 (\u03a612 \u2212 \u03a613 )\n\n(4.6)\n\n\u03a6123 \u2212 \u03a62 = b2 (\u03a623 \u2212 \u03a612 ).\nAs in the case of reciprocal triangles, the latter system implies that\n(1 + c3 b + a1 b + c3 a)(\u03a61 \u2212 \u03a63 ) = (c3 a \u2212 a1 c)(\u03a61 \u2212 \u03a62 )\n(1 + a1 c + b2 c + a1 b)(\u03a62 \u2212 \u03a61 ) = (a1 b \u2212 b2 a)(\u03a62 \u2212 \u03a63 ).\n\n(4.7)\n\nHowever, the 8-point relation (4.3) is equivalent to any of the relations a1 b = b2 a,\nb2 c = c3 b or c3 a = a1 c. Consequently, the right-hand sides of (4.7) vanish and\nthe left-hand sides provide another two constraints on the complex dilations.\nThus, we obtain the following generalization of Theorem 1:\nTheorem 3 (Algebraic description of reciprocal (4, 6) configurations).\nThe complex dilations a, b, c and a1 , b2 , c3 as defined by (4.5) and (4.6) associated\nwith two reciprocal (4, 6) configurations are related by\na1 = \u2212\n\na\n,\nab + bc + ca\n\nb2 = \u2212\n\nb\n,\nab + bc + ca\n\nc3 = \u2212\n\nc\n.\nab + bc + ca\n\n(4.8)\n\nConversely, let \u03a61 , \u03a62 , \u03a63 and \u03a6 be four generic points on the complex plane,\na, b, c \u2208 C be arbitrary non-vanishing complex numbers and a1 , b2 , c3 be given\nby (4.8). Then, the unique solution of the compatible linear system (4.5), (4.6)\ngives rise to reciprocal (4, 6) configurations with vertices \u03a61 , \u03a62 , \u03a63 , \u03a6123 and\n\u03a623 , \u03a613 , \u03a612 , \u03a6 respectively.\nTheorems 1 and 3 are formulated in such a way that a remarkable connection\nwith soliton theory is readily established. Indeed, it is shown below that the\nnonlinear system (4.8) may be identified with a well-known and distinct discrete\nintegrable equation with (4.5) being its standard linear representation. A similar\ngeometric link with the Schwarzian Kadomtsev-Petviashvili hierarchy provided\nby the ancient Greek Theorem of Menelaus has been recorded earlier in [28].\n\n5\n\nThe discrete BKP equation\n\nIn this section, we are concerned with (pairs) of lattices which consist of an\ninfinite number of reciprocal triangles or (4, 6) configurations. In order to show\nthe existence of such lattices, it is convenient to introduce a canonical notation\nassociated with three-dimensional lattices on the complex plane of Z3 combinatorics, that is maps of the form\n\u03a6 : Z3 \u2192 C,\n\n(n1 , n2 , n3 ) 7\u2192 \u03a6(n2 , n2 , n3 ).\n\n12\n\n(5.1)\n\n\f(a)\n\n23\n\n123\n\n3\n\n13\n\n23\n\n123\n\n13\n\n3\n2\n\n12\n\n2\n\n0\n\n(b)\n\n1\n\n0\n\n12\n\n1\n\nFigure 7: The elementary cells of G(1) and G(0)\n\nFigure 8: The stella octangula\n\nFigure 9: A modified stella octangula\n\nThus, we supress the arguments of \u03a6 and indicate unit increments of the discrete\nvariables or, equivalently, shifts on the lattice along the edges by indices:\n\u03a6 = \u03a6(n1 , n2 , n3 ),\n\n\u03a61 = \u03a6(n1 + 1, n2 , n3 ),\n\n\u03a612 = \u03a6(n1 + 1, n2 + 1, n3 ) . . . .\n(5.2)\nSince reciprocal triangles constitute projections of tetrahedral polyhedra, it is\nnatural to consider lattices on the complex plane which represent images of\nthree-dimensional lattices consisting of tetrahedra. A canonical construction\nof the latter is obtained by starting at a vertex of the Z3 cubic lattice and\ndrawing diagonals across the faces of the cubes. The six diagonals on each\ncube then form a tetrahedron as shown in Figure 7, while the polyhedron inscribed in eight adjacent cubes is readily seen to be the stellated octahedron\n(stella octangula), that is an octahedron which is enclosed by eight tetrahedra\n(cf. Figure 8). Accordingly, the complete lattice is obtained by stacking stella\noctangulae. This lattice may be interpreted as a face-centred cubic (fcc) lattice\nor a face-centred cubic sphere packing [34] with the edges linking the centres of\nthe spheres. Hence, we here consider lattices on the complex plane of the form\n\u03a6(0) : G(0) \u2192 C\nG(0) = {(n1 , n2 , n3 ) \u2208 Z3 : n1 + n2 + n3 even}.\n\n13\n\n(5.3)\n\n\fIt is our aim to show that two lattices of this type which consist of reciprocal\ntriangles or (4, 6) configurations are integrable. To this end, the second lattice\nof the type (5.3) is labelled according to (cf. Figure 7(a))\n\u03a6(1) : G(1) \u2192 C\nG(1) = {(n1 , n2 , n3 ) \u2208 Z3 : n1 + n2 + n3 odd}.\n\n(5.4)\n\nSince the set G(1) is the complement of G(0) with respect to Z3 , we are now in\na position to combine the lattices \u03a6(0) and \u03a6(1) to one lattice \u03a6:\n\u03a6(n) = \u03a6(i) (n) if n \u2208 G(i) .\n\n(5.5)\n\nThis is merely done for reasons of book-keeping. It is interesting to note that the\nstructure of these interpenetrating fcc lattices is precisely that of the sodium\nchloride crystal, where the Na+ ions form one fcc lattice and the second fcc\nlattice consists of Cl\u2212 ions.\nIt is now evident that the lattices \u03a6(0) and \u03a6(1) are composed of reciprocal\ntriangles or (4, 6) configurations if the lattice \u03a6 obeys the linear lattice equations\n\u03a612 \u2212 \u03a6 = c(\u03a61 \u2212 \u03a62 )\n\u03a623 \u2212 \u03a6 = a(\u03a62 \u2212 \u03a63 )\n\n(5.6)\n\n\u03a613 \u2212 \u03a6 = b(\u03a63 \u2212 \u03a61 ),\nwhere a, b, c are as yet unspecified dilation functions. For such lattices to exist,\nthe compatibility conditions (\u03a612 )3 = (\u03a623 )1 = (\u03a613 )2 need to be satisfied.\nThese encapsulate the fact that the construction of the vertex \u03a6123 in the three\ndifferent ways\n\u03a6123 \u2212 \u03a63 = c3 (\u03a613 \u2212 \u03a623 )\n\u03a6123 \u2212 \u03a61 = a1 (\u03a612 \u2212 \u03a613 )\n\n(5.7)\n\n\u03a6123 \u2212 \u03a62 = b2 (\u03a623 \u2212 \u03a612 )\nmust lead to the same result. Since the systems (4.6) and (5.7) are identical, the\ncompatibility conditions coincide with those associated with reciprocal triangles\nor (4, 6) configurations, that is\nE 1 (\u03a61 \u2212 \u03a63 ) = E 2 (\u03a61 \u2212 \u03a62 ),\n\nE 3 (\u03a62 \u2212 \u03a63 ) = E 4 (\u03a62 \u2212 \u03a63 )\n\n(5.8)\n\nwith the coefficients E i given by\nE 1 = 1 + c3 b + a1 b + c3 a,\n\nE 2 = c3 a \u2212 a1 c\n\nE 3 = 1 + a1 c + b2 c + a1 b,\n\nE 4 = a1 b \u2212 b2 a.\n\n(5.9)\n\nMoreover, the results of Section 3 imply that the coefficients E i vanish if and\nonly if the dilation functions satisfy the algebraic system (4.8) now regarded as\nlattice equations. Any real or complex solution of the latter therefore defines\nlattices composed of reciprocal triangles or (4, 6) configurations respectively.\n14\n\n\fThe fact that the nonlinear system of difference equations (4.8) is obtainable from the compatibility conditions for the linear system (5.6) suggests that\nthere exists a connection with soliton theory. Indeed, the relations a1 b = b2 a,\nb2 c = c3 b and c3 a = a1 c guarantee that there exists a potential \u03c4 which parametrizes the dilations a, b, c according to\na=\n\n\u03c42 \u03c43\n,\n\u03c4 \u03c423\n\nb=\n\n\u03c41 \u03c43\n,\n\u03c4 \u03c413\n\nc=\n\n\u03c41 \u03c42\n.\n\u03c4 \u03c412\n\n(5.10)\n\nThe system (4.8) then reduces to an integrable single equation known as the\ndiscrete BKP (dBKP) equation [21] and (5.6) is nothing but its standard linear\nrepresentation (see, e.g., [22]). Thus, the following theorem obtains:\nTheorem 4 (BKP lattices). Three-dimensional lattices \u03a6 on the complex\nplane with constituent sublattices \u03a6(0) and \u03a6(1) of fcc combinatorics consist\nof reciprocal (4, 6) configurations (triangles) with corresponding quadruplets of\nvertices (\u03a623 , \u03a613 , \u03a612 , \u03a6) and (\u03a61 , \u03a62 , \u03a63 , \u03a6123 ) if and only if the complex (real)\ndilations defined by\n\u03c41 \u03c42\n\u03a612 \u2212 \u03a6 =\n(\u03a61 \u2212 \u03a62 )\n\u03c4 \u03c412\n\u03c42 \u03c43\n(\u03a62 \u2212 \u03a63 )\n\u03a623 \u2212 \u03a6 =\n(5.11)\n\u03c4 \u03c423\n\u03c41 \u03c43\n(\u03a63 \u2212 \u03a61 )\n\u03a613 \u2212 \u03a6 =\n\u03c4 \u03c413\nmay be parametrized in terms of solutions of the discrete BKP equation\n\u03c4 \u03c4123 + \u03c41 \u03c423 + \u03c42 \u03c413 + \u03c43 \u03c412 = 0.\n\n(5.12)\n\nLattices of this type are equivalently described by the 8-point lattice equation\nQ(\u03a61 , \u03a62 , \u03a63 , \u03a6123 ) = Q(\u03a623 , \u03a613 , \u03a612 , \u03a6).\n\n(5.13)\n\nThe celebrated Kadomtsev-Petviashvili (KP) hierarchy of integrable equations is often referred to as the AKP hierarchy due to its deep connection with\nthe Lie algebra A\u221e = gl(\u221e) [35]. The hierarchy associated with the Lie algebra\nB\u221e = so(\u221e) is known as the BKP hierarchy. The dBKP equation encodes the\ncomplete BKP hierarchy of soliton equations [21]. Indeed, by applying appropriate continuum limits to the dBKP equation, any member of the BKP family may\nbe obtained. Proto-typical examples are the 2+1-dimensional Sawada-Kotera\nand Nizhnik-Veselov-Novikov equations [35].\nIt was pointed out in [22] that there exists a 'natural' continuum limit in\nwhich the variables ni are regarded as direct discretizations of some continuous variables which leads to the integrable 2+1-dimensional generalization of\nthe classical sine-Gordon equation set down in [36]. In fact, the dBKP equation was shown to represent a superposition principle for eight solutions of the\n2+1-dimensional sine-Gordon system generated by the classical Moutard transformation [37]. In subsequent work [23], the superposition principle for the\n15\n\n\fassociated eigenfunctions was set down but it did not occur to the authors that\nit may be cast into the form of the 8-point relation (5.13). By construction,\nthe latter is equivalent to the dSKP equation. In analogy with the discrete\n(Schwarzian) KP equation [38]-[40], it may be termed discrete Schwarzian BKP\n(dSBKP) equation since it is invariant under M\u00f6bius transformations and constitutes a compact form of the hierarchy of singular manifold equations associated\nwith the BKP hierarchy.\nIn summary, it has been shown that, in the setting of inversive geometry,\nreciprocal triangles and, more generally, reciprocal (4, 6) configurations encapsulate the integrable dBKP and dSBKP equations and hence the associated\nsemi-discrete and continuous hierarchies of integrable equations. It is therefore\nnatural to refer to the lattices composed of these figures as BKP lattices. BKP\nlattices consisting of reciprocal triangles correspond to real solutions of the BKP\nequation. Purely imaginary solutions of the BKP equation in the form (4.8) may\nbe associated with lattices that contain reciprocal triangles whose edges meet\nat right angles. We observe in passing that BKP lattices consisting of reciprocal triangles may also be defined in ambient spaces of arbitrary dimension.\nIndeed, if we regard \u03a6 as a real vector-valued function in Rn and the function \u03c4\nconstitutes a real solution of the BKP equation then the linear system (5.11)\nremains compatible and the corresponding lattice is composed of reciprocal triangles. Furthermore, since both the vertices \u03a61 , \u03a62 , \u03a63 , \u03a6123 and the vertices\n\u03a623 , \u03a613 , \u03a612 , \u03a6 are coplanar, the quadrilaterals (\u03a6, \u03a6i , \u03a6k , \u03a6ik ), i < k are planar (but non-embedded). Thus, lattices in Rn consisting of reciprocal triangles\nconstitute particular conjugate lattices [41]. From an algebraic point of view,\nthis is evident since (5.11) represents three coupled discrete Darboux equations [42, 43].\n\n6\n\nParticular BKP lattices. Sine-Gordon and\nTzitz\u00e9ica lattices\n\nThere exists a great variety of reductions of both the dBKP and dSBKP equations each of which may now be analysed with respect to its geometric significance. Here, we embark on such a geometric analysis and discuss two canonical reductions leading to particular BKP lattices. Firstly, since the dSBKP\nequation is invariant under inversion, it is natural to focus on lattices which\nconstitute fixed points of inversive transformations. For instance, if we consider\nthe reduction \u03a6 = 1/\u03a6\u0304 then the parametrization\n\u03a6 = e2i\u03c9 ,\n\n(6.1)\n\nwhere \u03c9 denotes a real function, reduces the dSBKP equation to\nsin(\u03c923 \u2212 \u03c913 ) sin(\u03c912 \u2212 \u03c9)\nsin(\u03c91 \u2212 \u03c92 ) sin(\u03c93 \u2212 \u03c9123 )\n=\n.\nsin(\u03c92 \u2212 \u03c93 ) sin(\u03c9123 \u2212 \u03c91 )\nsin(\u03c913 \u2212 \u03c912 ) sin(\u03c9 \u2212 \u03c923 )\n\n16\n\n(6.2)\n\n\fAs shown in [23], this equation constitutes an integrable discretization of the\n2+1-dimensional sine-Gordon equation\n\u03c9xyz = \u03c9x \u03c9yz cot \u03c9 \u2212 \u03c9y \u03c9xz tan \u03c9\n\n(6.3)\n\nwhich was first set down by Darboux [44] in connection with triply orthogonal\nsystems of surfaces and later rediscovered in [36, 45] as a canonical reduction\nof the 2+1-dimensional sine-Gordon system alluded to in the preceding section.\nIt has also been derived in the context of three-dimensional discrete 'curvature'\nlattices on the plane [46].\nSecondly, it is natural to consider BKP lattices which are mapped to itself\nby discrete rotations, scalings or both. For instance, it may be assumed that k\nshifts along the edges in the n3 -direction amount to a combination of a scaling\nand a rotation of the lattice, viz\n\u03a6(n3 + k) = c\u03a6(n3 ),\n\nc \u2208 C, k \u2208 N.\n\n(6.4)\n\nThis corresponds to k-periodic reductions of the dBKP equation. It turns out\nthat the dBKP equation may be solved explicitly if k = 1 and reduces to a\nlinear equation if the period is k = 2. The first nontrivial case is given by k = 3,\nthat is\n\u03a6333 = c\u03a6, \u03c4333 = \u03c4.\n(6.5)\nThus, if we introduce the quantities\n\u03c1 = \u03c43 ,\n\n\u03c3 = \u03c433\n\n(6.6)\n\nthen the dBKP equation (5.12) turns into the coupled system of three twodimensional equations\n\u03c4 \u03c112 + \u03c41 \u03c12 + \u03c42 \u03c11 + \u03c1\u03c412 = 0\n\u03c1\u03c312 + \u03c11 \u03c32 + \u03c12 \u03c31 + \u03c3\u03c112 = 0\n\n(6.7)\n\n\u03c3\u03c412 + \u03c31 \u03c42 + \u03c32 \u03c41 + \u03c4 \u03c312 = 0.\nInspection of this system shows that it is convenient to define quantities \u03c6, \u03c8\nand H according to\n\u03c1 = \u03c4 \u03c6,\n\n\u03c3 = \u03c4 \u03c8,\n\nH =\u2212\n\n\u03c41 \u03c42\n\u03c4 \u03c412\n\n(6.8)\n\nso that we obtain the two linear equations\n\u03c612 + \u03c6 = H(\u03c61 + \u03c62 ),\n\n\u03c812 + \u03c8 = H(\u03c81 + \u03c82 )\n\n(6.9)\n\nsubject to the quadratic constraint\nH[\u03c8(\u03c61 + \u03c62 ) + (\u03c81 + \u03c82 )\u03c6 \u2212 \u03c82 \u03c61 \u2212 \u03c81 \u03c62 ] = 2\u03c8\u03c6.\n\n17\n\n(6.10)\n\n\fIf we shift this constraint in the n1 - and n2 -directions then we obtain two equations which may be separated into four linear equations by introducing functions\nof separation A and B. These read\n\u03c611 \u2212 \u03c61 =\n\nA\nH1 \u2212 1\n(\u03c61 \u2212 \u03c6) +\n(\u03c612 \u2212 \u03c61 )\nH1 (H \u2212 1)\nH \u22121\n\n\u03c622 \u2212 \u03c62 =\n\nH2 \u2212 1\nB\n(\u03c62 \u2212 \u03c6) +\n(\u03c612 \u2212 \u03c62 )\nH2 (H \u2212 1)\nH \u22121\n\n\u03c811 \u2212 \u03c81 =\n\nH1 \u2212 1\nA\n(\u03c81 \u2212 \u03c8) \u2212\n(\u03c812 \u2212 \u03c81 )\nH1 (H \u2212 1)\nH \u22121\n\n\u03c822 \u2212 \u03c82 =\n\nB\nH2 \u2212 1\n(\u03c82 \u2212 \u03c8) \u2212\n(\u03c812 \u2212 \u03c82 ).\nH2 (H \u2212 1)\nH \u22121\n\n(6.11)\n\nWe observe that the two systems (6.11)1,2 and (6.11)3,4 differ only by the signs\nin front of A and B. In fact, the two systems may be regarded as mutually adjoint with (6.10) being an admissible constraint. This is reflected by\nthe fact that the compatibility conditions (\u03c611 )2 = (\u03c612 )1 , (\u03c622 )1 = (\u03c612 )2 and\n(\u03c811 )2 = (\u03c812 )1 , (\u03c822 )1 = (\u03c812 )2 produce the same nonlinear difference equations for A, B and H, namely\nA2 =\nH12\n\nH1\nA,\nH\n\nB1 =\n\nH2\nB\nH\n\nH(H \u2212 1)\n.\n= 2\nH (H1 + H2 \u2212 H1 H2 ) \u2212 H + ABH1 H2\n\n(6.12)\n\nThe latter system constitutes an integrable discretization of the gauge-invariant\nform of the classical Tzitz\u00e9ica equation [47, 48]\n(ln h)xy = h \u2212 h\u22122 .\n\n(6.13)\n\nIt is interesting to note that the discrete Tzitz\u00e9ica system has been shown to\ngovern canonical discrete analogues of affine spheres which have been defined in\na purely geometric manner in [26, 27].\nA single equation may be obtained by parametrizing A, B and H according to\nA=\n\n\u03c4\u030312\n,\n\u03c4\u0303 \u03c4\u030311\n\nH=\n\n\u03c4\u03031 \u03c4\u03032\n,\n\u03c4\u0303 \u03c4\u030312\n\nB=\n\n\u03c4\u030322\n\u03c4\u0303 \u03c4\u030322\n\n(6.14)\n\nso that (6.12)1,2 are identically satisfied. The remaining relation then reduces\nto the discrete Tzitz\u00e9ica equation\n\u03c4\u0303 \u03c4\u03031 \u03c4\u030311\n3\n\u03c4\u03032 \u03c4\u030312 \u03c4\u0303112 + \u03c4\u030312\n= 0.\n\u03c4\u030322 \u03c4\u0303122 \u03c4\u03031122\n\n(6.15)\n\nSince \u03c4\u0303 = (\u22121)n1 n2 \u03c4 without loss of generality, it is evident that the quantities\n\u03c1\u0303 = (\u22121)n1 n2 \u03c1 and \u03c3\u0303 = (\u22121)n1 n2 \u03c3 constitute another two solutions of the\n18\n\n\fdiscrete Tzitz\u00e9ica equation. In fact, the relations (6.8)1,2 imply that these three\nsolutions of the Tzitz\u00e9ica equation are related by the discrete version of the\nclassical Tzitz\u00e9ica transformation set down in [25, 26].\nThe above link with the discrete Tzitz\u00e9ica transformation may be further\ninvestigated by considering the linear system (5.11) for the lattice function \u03a6.\nThus, if we introduce the notation\n\u03a63 = \u03c8,\n\n\u03a633 = \u039e\n\n(6.16)\n\nthen we obtain nine equations with coefficients depending on \u03c4, \u03c1 and \u03c3.

Hence, the system (6.17) represents the standard parameter-dependent linear representation\nof the discrete Tzitz\u00e9ica system [25]-[27]. Furthermore, for symmetry reasons,\nthe quantities \u03c8 and \u039e obey analogous linear systems associated with the solutions \u03c1\u0303 and \u03c3\u0303 of the discrete Tzitz\u00e9ica equation. Indeed, it turns out that\n\u03c8 and \u039e as given by (6.18) are discrete Tzitz\u00e9ica transforms [25, 26] of \u03a6. We\nhave therefore established that BKP lattices subject to the symmetry constraint\n\u03a6333 = c\u03a6 may be decomposed into two-dimensional 'Tzitz\u00e9ica' lattices defined\nby (6.17) and their discrete Tzitz\u00e9ica transforms \u03c8 and \u039e.\nWe conclude this section with the remark that the dBKP equation may also\nbe regarded as a fully discrete version of the B\u221e Toda lattice. Accordingly, the\ndiscrete Tzitz\u00e9ica equation constitutes the period 3 reduction of the fully discrete\nToda lattice. This is in harmony with the fact that the Tzitz\u00e9ica equation\nnot only appears in the context of affine differential geometry [49] but also\nconstitutes the period 3 reduction of the B\u221e Toda lattice [50].\n\n7\n\nContinuum limits.

Its\nsolutions constitute mappings \u03a6 : R3 \u2192 C to which we shall refer as SBKP\nmappings.\nIn order to investigate the nature of SBKP mappings, it is first noted that\nthe system (7.6) gives rise to the consistency condition\na\u22121b\u22121c\u22121\n= 1.\na+1b+1c+1\n\n(7.7)\n\nAccordingly, if we set \u03b3 = (c \u2212 1)/(c + 1) and \u03b4 = (b + 1)/(b \u2212 1) then SBKP\nmappings are obtained by integrating the linear pair\n\u03a6y = \u03b3\u03a6x ,\n\n\u03a6t = \u03b4\u03a6x ,\n\n(7.8)\n\nwhere \u03b3, \u03b4 are solutions of the coupled nonlinear system\n\u03b3t + \u03b3\u03b4x = \u03b4y + \u03b4\u03b3x ,\n\n(1 \u2212 \u03b4 2 )\u03b3t = (1 \u2212 \u03b3 2 )\u03b4y .\n20\n\n(7.9)\n\n\f\u03c8\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n\u03c81\n\n4\n3\n7\n3\n\n\u03a6\n\n10\n\n\u03a613\n\n2\n\n\u03a623\n\n8\n\n\u03a612\n\n1\n\n8\n\n7\n\n6\n\n\u03a63\n\n10\n\n9\n2\n4\n\n\u03a61\n\n\u03c8 12\n\n\u03a6123\n\n6\n\n5\n\n9\n\n5\n\n1\n\n\u03c82\n\n\u03a62\nFigure 10: Reciprocal (6, 10) figures\n\nThe latter system comprises (7.5) and the compatibility condition for (7.6). In\nterms of the variables\ni\u2212\u03b3\n\u03bc=\n, z = x + iy,\n(7.10)\ni+\u03b3\nthe linear system (7.8) reads\n\u03a6z\u0304 = \u03bc\u03a6z ,\n\n\u03a6t = \u03b4(\u03a6z + \u03a6z\u0304 ).\n\n(7.11)\n\nThus, SBKP mappings are descriptive of particular evolutions of quasi-conformal\nmappings if the variable t is interpreted as time and the complex dilation \u03bc in the\nBeltrami equation (7.11)1 is assumed to be bounded [51]-[53]. In other words,\nSBKP mappings consist of one-parameter families of quasi-conformal mappings\n\u03a6(t) : C \u2192 C. The solutions of the dSBKP equation therefore constitute integrable discretizations of particular families of quasi-conformal mappings.\n\n8\n\n'Integrable' reciprocal (6, 10) figures, configurations and associated lattices\n\nIt turns out that the dBKP equation is but the simplest integrable equation\nwhich may be derived from reciprocal figures. Another example is obtained if\nwe remove two edges from Maxwell's 'octahedral' figure as displayed in Figure 3(a) in order to achieve determinacy. Indeed, Figure 10(a) now consists\nof six vertices, six polygons and ten edges and thus admits a reciprocal figure with the same number of vertices and edges which is uniquely determined\nup to an arbitrary scaling. We shall refer to reciprocal figures of this kind as\nreciprocal (6, 10) figures.\n\n21\n\n\f8.1\n\nReciprocal (6, 10) figures and configurations\n\nWe first exploit the fact that Maxwell's theorem guarantees the existence of\nreciprocal (6, 10) figures and label the vertices by \u03c8, \u03c8 12 , \u03a61 , \u03a62 , \u03a613 , \u03a623 and\n\u03c8 1 , \u03c8 2 , \u03a6, \u03a63 , \u03a612 , \u03a6123 respectively. Here, this particular labelling is of no relevance but will turn out to be of importance in connection with (6, 10) lattices.\nIt proves convenient to group the conditions of parallelism into two sets of linear\nequations, namely\n\u03a612 \u2212 \u03a6 = a(\u03a61 \u2212 \u03a62 ),\n\n\u03c8 1 \u2212 \u03a6 = d(\u03a61 \u2212 \u03c8)\n\n\u03a613 \u2212 \u03c8 = b(\u03c8 1 \u2212 \u03a63 ),\n\n\u03c8 2 \u2212 \u03a6 = e(\u03a62 \u2212 \u03c8)\n\n(8.1)\n\n\u03a623 \u2212 \u03c8 = c(\u03c8 2 \u2212 \u03a63 )\nand\n\n\u03a6123 \u2212 \u03a63 = a3 (\u03a613 \u2212 \u03a623 ),\n\n\u03c8 12 \u2212 \u03a62 = d2 (\u03a612 \u2212 \u03c8 2 )\n\n\u03a6123 \u2212 \u03c8 2 = b2 (\u03c8 12 \u2212 \u03a623 ),\n\n\u03c8 12 \u2212 \u03a61 = e1 (\u03a612 \u2212 \u03c8 1 )\n\n(8.2)\n\n\u03a6123 \u2212 \u03c8 1 = c1 (\u03c8 12 \u2212 \u03a613 )\nwith associated real dilation coefficients a, b, c, d, e and a3 , b2 , c1 , d2 , e1 . Elimination of \u03c8 12 between (8.2)2,4 on the one hand and \u03c8 12 , \u03a6123 between (8.2)1,3,5\non the other hand results in\n[d2 a + e1 (d \u2212 a) \u2212 1](\u03a61 \u2212 \u03c8) + [e1 a \u2212 d2 (e + a) + 1](\u03a62 \u2212 \u03c8) = 0\n[(c1 a3 \u2212 b2 c1 \u2212 a3 b2 )b + b2 ](\u03c8 1 \u2212 \u03a63 )\n\n(8.3)\n\n+ [(b2 a3 \u2212 a3 c1 + c1 b2 )c \u2212 c1 ](\u03c8 2 \u2212 \u03a63 ) = 0.\nSince we consider the generic case, neither the vertices \u03c8, \u03a61 , \u03a62 nor the vertices \u03c8 1 , \u03c8 2 , \u03a63 are collinear. Hence, the relations (8.3) may be solved for\nb2 , c1 , d2 , e1 . The remaining consistency condition (8.2)3 \u2212(8.2)5 then reduces to\n{a3 [bc(ad + ed \u2212 ea) + a(b \u2212 c)] \u2212 a}(\u03c8 1 \u2212 \u03c8 2 ) = 0\n\n(8.4)\n\nso that a3 is likewise determined.\nAn algebraic proof of the existence of reciprocal (6, 10) figures is now readily obtained. Thus, given a generic (6, 10) figure with vertices \u03c8, \u03c8 12 , \u03a61 , \u03a62 ,\n\u03a613 , \u03a623 , we draw a line parallel to the edge (\u03a61 , \u03a62 ) and choose two points \u03a6\nand \u03a612 on this line. The vertices \u03c8 1 and \u03c8 2 are then given by the points of\nintersection of the pairs of lines which pass through \u03a6 and \u03a612 and are parallel\nto the corresponding edges of the original figure (cf. Figure 10). The vertex \u03a63\nis constructed in a similar manner. In algebraic terms, this implies that the\nlinear equations (8.1), (8.2)2,4 are satisfied with some real dilations a, b, c, d, e\nand d2 , e1 . The latter two dilations are determined by (8.3)1 . Finally, the three\nlines which pass through \u03c8 1 , \u03c8 2 , \u03a63 and are parallel to the edges (\u03c8 12 , \u03a613 ),\n(\u03c8 12 , \u03a623 ), (\u03a613 , \u03a623 ) respectively are concurrent since the remaining linear\nequations (8.2)1,3,5 are compatible if the coefficients a3 , b2 , c1 are defined by the\ncompatibility conditions (8.3)2 and (8.4). Accordingly, the reciprocal (6, 10)\n22\n\n\ffigure exists and is defined up to an arbitrary scaling. An alternative method\nof constructing reciprocal (6, 10) figures is stated in the following theorem:\nTheorem 5 (Reciprocal (6, 10) figures). The real dilations a, b, c, d, e and\na3 , b2 , c1 , d2 , e1 as defined by (8.1) and (8.2) associated with two reciprocal (6, 10)\nconfigurations are related by\na3 =\n\na\nbc(ad + ed \u2212 ea) + a(b \u2212 c)\n\nb2 =\n\na3 (c \u2212 b) + 1\n,\nc\n\nc1 =\n\na3 (c \u2212 b) + 1\nb\n\nd2 =\n\nd\n,\nad + ed \u2212 ea\n\ne1 =\n\ne\n.\nad + ed \u2212 ea\n\n(8.5)\n\nConversely, let \u03a6, \u03a61 , \u03a62 , \u03a63 , \u03c8 be five generic points on the complex plane,\na, b, c, d, e \u2208 R be five arbitrary non-vanishing real numbers and a3 , b2 , c1 , d2 , e1\nbe given by (8.5). Then, the linear system (8.1), (8.2) is compatible and the\npoints \u03c8, \u03c8 12 , \u03a61 , \u03a62 , \u03a613 , \u03a623 and \u03c8 1 , \u03c8 2 , \u03a6, \u03a63 , \u03a612 , \u03a6123 constitute the vertices of two reciprocal (6, 10) figures. These obey the cross-ratio relations\nQ(\u03a61 , \u03a62 , \u03c8, \u03c8 12 ) = Q(\u03c8 2 , \u03c8 1 , \u03a612 , \u03a6)\nQ(\u03c8 1 , \u03c8 2 , \u03a63 , \u03a6123 ) = Q(\u03a623 , \u03a613 , \u03c812 , \u03c8).\n\n(8.6)\n\nThe above cross-ratio relations are a consequence of the identities cb2 = bc1\nand ed2 = de1 . They express the fact that the quadruplets (\u03a61 , \u03a62 , \u03c8, \u03c8 12 ) and\n(\u03c8 2 , \u03c81 , \u03a612 , \u03a6) on the one hand and (\u03a623 , \u03a613 , \u03c8 12 , \u03c8) and (\u03c8 1 , \u03c8 2 , \u03a63 , \u03a6123 )\non the other hand give rise to two pairs of reciprocal triangles if the parallel line\nsegments (\u03c8, \u03c812 ) and (\u03c8 1 , \u03c8 2 ) are drawn (cf. Figure 10). The occurrence of\ncross-ratios once again suggests that reciprocal (6, 10) figures should be regarded\nas degenerate reciprocal (6, 10) configurations. Indeed, if, in a (6, 10) figure, we\nreplace the straight edges by circular arcs whose extensions meet at a point then\ntwo such (6, 10) configurations are reciprocally related if corresponding angles\nare equal. As in the case of reciprocal (4, 6) configurations, it is now straight\nforward to show that reciprocal (6, 10) configurations are governed by the crossratio relations (8.6) and the associated complex dilations satisfy the algebraic\nrelations (8.5).\n\n8.2\n\nReciprocal (6, 10) lattices\n\nAs in the case of reciprocal triangles, it is now possible to define lattices which\nconsist of reciprocal (6, 10) figures and configurations. Thus, we consider two\nthree-dimensional lattices on the complex plane of the same combinatorics and\nlabel them as follows. The sets G(0) and G(1) are defined as in Section 5, that is\nG(0) = {(n1 , n2 , n4 ) \u2208 Z3 : n1 + n2 + n4 even}\nG(1) = {(n1 , n2 , n4 ) \u2208 Z3 : n1 + n2 + n4 odd}.\n23\n\n(8.7)\n\n\f244\n\n144\n\n44\n24\n\n44\n124\n\n4\n\n24\n\n14\n\n1244\n\n144\n\n2\n\n0\n\n1\n\n124\n\n14\n\n4\n12\n\n2\n\n0\n\n244\n\n1244\n\n12\n\n1\n\nFigure 11: The elementary cells of G(1) and G(0)\nHowever, the edge structure of the lattices associated with G(0) and G(1) is\nslightly modified in order to take into account that the reciprocal figures displayed in Figure 10 consist of two pairs of reciprocal triangles if the dotted\nlines are included. Accordingly, every second 'horizontal' edge which joins two\ntetrahedra placed on top of each other is removed from the lattices associated\nwith G(0) and G(1) . This is indicated in Figure 11. Hence, the polyhedron\ninscribed in eight cubes of the Z3 lattice constitutes a stella octangula without\nthe central horizontal edges (cf. Figure 9). Due to the complementary character\nof G(0) and G(1) , the associated lattices \u03a6(0) and \u03a6(1) may now be combined to\na lattice\n\u03a6\u0302(n) = \u03a6(i) (n) if n \u2208 G(i) , n = (n1 , n2 , n4 ).\n(8.8)\nIn order to simplify the book-keeping which takes care of the missing horizontal\nedges, it is convenient to introduce two lattices \u03a6 and \u03c8 according to\n\u03a6(n1 , n2 , n3 ) = \u03a6\u0302(n1 , n2 , 2n3 ),\n\n\u03c8(n1 , n2 , n3 ) = \u03a6\u0302(n1 , n2 , 2n3 + 1).\n\n(8.9)\n\nAs a consequence of Theorem 5, the consistency conditions (8.3) and (8.4)\nmay be interpreted as the compatibility conditions for the linear difference equations (8.1) which guarantee the existence of two three-dimensional lattices \u03a6\nand \u03c8 on the complex plane which encapsulate an infinite number of reciprocal\n(6, 10) figures or configurations via their constituent sublattices \u03a6(0) and \u03a6(1) .\nBy virtue of the identities cb2 = bc1 , ed2 = de1 and cda3 = ac1 d2 , the dilations\nmay be parametrized in terms of two functions \u03c4 and \u03c3. The relations (8.5),\nnow regarded as difference equations, then reduce to a system of two integrable\nequations. This is the content of the following theorem:\nTheorem 6 ((6, 10) lattices). Two three-dimensional lattices \u03a6 and \u03c8 or,\nequivalently, \u03a6(0) and \u03a6(1) on the complex plane consist of reciprocal (6, 10)\nconfigurations (figures) with vertices \u03c8, \u03c8 12 , \u03a61 , \u03a62 , \u03a613 , \u03a623 and \u03c8 1 , \u03c8 2 , \u03a6, \u03a63 ,\n\n24\n\n\f\u03a612 , \u03a6123 if and only if the complex (real) dilations defined by\n\u03c41 \u03c42\n(\u03a61 \u2212 \u03a62 ),\n\u03c4 \u03c412\n\u03c31 \u03c43\n(\u03c8 \u2212 \u03a63 ),\n\u03a613 \u2212 \u03c8 =\n\u03c3\u03c413 1\n\u03c32 \u03c43\n(\u03c8 \u2212 \u03a63 )\n\u03a623 \u2212 \u03c8 =\n\u03c3\u03c423 2\n\u03a612 \u2212 \u03a6 =\n\n\u03c41 \u03c3\n(\u03a61 \u2212 \u03c8)\n\u03c4 \u03c31\n\u03c42 \u03c3\n\u03c82 \u2212 \u03a6 =\n(\u03a62 \u2212 \u03c8)\n\u03c4 \u03c32\n\n\u03c81 \u2212 \u03a6 =\n\n(8.10)\n\nmay be parametrized in terms of solutions of the coupled BKP-type system\n\u03c312 \u03c4 + \u03c31 \u03c42 = \u03c3\u03c412 + \u03c32 \u03c41\n\u03c3\u03c4123 + \u03c32 \u03c413 = \u03c312 \u03c43 + \u03c31 \u03c423 .\n\n(8.11)\n\nLattices of this type are equivalently described by the cross-ratio relations\nQ(\u03a61 , \u03a62 , \u03c8, \u03c8 12 ) = Q(\u03c8 2 , \u03c8 1 , \u03a612 , \u03a6)\nQ(\u03c8 1 , \u03c8 2 , \u03a63 , \u03a6123 ) = Q(\u03a623 , \u03a613 , \u03c812 , \u03c8).\n\n(8.12)\n\nIt turns out that the above results may be generalized. It is indeed possible\nto define integrable systems on three-dimensional hybrids of octahedral and\nhexahedral lattices which give rise to lattices on the complex plane composed\nof Maxwell's complete octahedral figures and their hexahedral reciprocals. This\nis briefly discussed in the final section.\n\n9\n\nReciprocal octahedral and hexahedral figures\n\nWe begin with an observation associated with reciprocal triangles and (6, 10)\nfigures. Thus, the 8-point relation (3.6) may be interpreted as the equality of\nthe cross-ratios associated with any two 'parallel' quadrilaterals which reside in\nreciprocal triangles. Indeed, for instance, the closed polygon\n\u03a61 \u2192 \u03a62 \u2192 \u03a63 \u2192 \u03a6123 \u2192 \u03a61\n\n(9.1)\n\nin Figure 4 admits the counterpart\n\u03a612 \u2192 \u03a6 \u2192 \u03a623 \u2192 \u03a613 \u2192 \u03a612\n\n(9.2)\n\nwith corresponding parallel edges and the 8-point relation may be written as\nQ(\u03a61 , \u03a62 , \u03a63 , \u03a6123 ) = Q(\u03a612 , \u03a6, \u03a623 , \u03a613 ).\n\n(9.3)\n\nThe cross-ratio relations (8.6) associated with the reciprocal (6, 10) figures depicted in Figure 10 admit the same interpretation. Moreover, these imply that,\nfor instance,\nM (\u03a61 , \u03a62 , \u03c8, \u03a623 , \u03a613 , \u03c8 12 ) = M (\u03a612 , \u03a6, \u03c8 2 , \u03a63 , \u03a6123 , \u03c81 ),\n25\n\n(9.4)\n\n\fP1\u2032\n\nP3\n\n11\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nP2\u2032\n\n4\n\n8\n\n3\n7\n\nP2\n\n7\n\n6\n10\n\nP4\n\n3\n\n2\n\n8\n\nP3\u2032\n\n1\n\nP6\u2032\n\n10\n\n9\n6\n\n11\n\n4\n\nP1\n\n2\n\n12\n\nP6\n\n5\n\n5\n\n9\n\n12\n\nP5\n\n1\n\nP4\u2032\nP5\u2032\n\nFigure 12: 'Parallel' hexagons H\nwhere the multi-ratio of six points P1 , . . . , P6 on the complex plane is defined by\nM (P1 , P2 , P3 , P4 , P5 , P6 ) =\n\n(P1 \u2212 P2 )(P3 \u2212 P4 )(P5 \u2212 P6 )\n.\n(P2 \u2212 P3 )(P4 \u2212 P5 )(P6 \u2212 P1 )\n\n(9.5)\n\nInspection of Figure 10 reveals that the points \u03a61 , \u03a62 , \u03c8, \u03a623 , \u03a613 , \u03c8 12 and\n\u03a612 , \u03a6, \u03c8 2 , \u03a63 , \u03a6123 , \u03c8 1 constitute the vertices of two 'parallel' hexagons which\nare generated by moving along the edges 1, 2, 6, 10, 8 and 4. We observe in\npassing that, up to complex conjugation, the multi-ratio is invariant under the\ngroup of inversive transformations. This has been exploited in [28] to relate the\ndiscrete Schwarzian KP equation to the fundamental Theorem of Menelaus in\nthe setting of plane inversive geometry.\nWe now focus on Maxwell's octahedral figure and its hexahedral reciprocals\nas displayed in Figure 3. It is readily seen that there exist four pairs of parallel\nhexagons. If the ordered collections of points P1 , . . . , P6 and P1\u2032 , . . . , P6\u2032 denote\nthe vertices of a hexagon\nH(P1 , P2 , P3 , P4 , P5 , P6 )\n\n(9.6)\n\nH(P1\u2032 , P2\u2032 , P3\u2032 , P4\u2032 , P5\u2032 , P6\u2032 )\n\n(9.7)\n\nand its parallel companion\n\nrespectively as shown in Figure 12 then real dilations \u03b1ik may be introduced\naccording to\nPi\u2032 \u2212 Pk\u2032 = \u03b1ik (Pi \u2212 Pk ).\n(9.8)\nAnother figure which turns out to be significant is that of two triangles joined\nby a vertex. Maxwell's octahedral figure contains twelve objects of this kind, an\nexample of which together with the associated parallel figure in the hexahedral\nreciprocal is shown in Figure 13.

The orientation of the vectors v i and v \u2032i is prescribed\nas follows. The vectors v \u2032i point towards the two vertices of T \u2032 which are dual\nto the two triangles in T , that is the vertices which are enclosed by v \u20321 , v \u20322 , v \u20323\nand v \u20324 , v \u20325 , v \u20326 respectively. We assign a counterclockwise (or clockwise) orientation to the quadrilateral in T \u2032 , that is we regard the quadrilateral as being\ngenerated by moving successively along the edges associated with v \u20322 , v \u20323 , v \u20324 , v \u20325 ,\nsay. The orientation of the degenerate hexagon T is defined to be that of the\nquadrilateral in the sense that we follow the edges in the same order, that is\nv 2 , (v 1 ), v 3 , v 4 , (v 6 ), v 5 . This determines the direction of the vectors v i . Associated dilations \u03b1i are then given by\nv \u2032i = \u03b1i v i .\n\n(9.11)\n\nIn Section 2, it has been demonstrated that any octahedral figure is associated with a two-parameter family of hexahedral reciprocals. As usual, we here\nregard figures which are similar as identical. This may now be exploited to construct a one-parameter family of reciprocals which has distinct properties. This\nis encapsulated in the following theorem which is a consequence of the analysis\nconducted below.\nTheorem 7 (A canonical class of reciprocal octahedral and hexahedral figures.) Any octahedral figure admits a one-parameter family of hexahedral reciprocals such that any two parallel hexagons H(P1 , P2 , P3 , P4 , P5 , P6 )\nand H(P1\u2032 , P2\u2032 , P3\u2032 , P4\u2032 , P5\u2032 , P6\u2032 ) and any two parallel figures T (v1 , v 2 , v 3 , v 4 , v 5 , v 6 )\n\n27\n\n\f\u03c81\n\u03c8\n11\n\n(a)\n\n\u03c71\n\n(b)\n\n4\n8\n\n3\n7\n\n\u03a613\n\n7\n\n6\n10\n\n\u03a623\n\n3\n\n2\n\n\u03a6\n\n1\n\n\u03a612\n\n\u03a63\n10\n\n8\n9\n6\n\n11\n\n4\n\n\u03a61\n\n\u03c712\n1\n\n2\n\n12\n5\n\n5\n\n\u03c72\n\n\u03a6123\n9\n\n12\n\n\u03a62\n\n\u03c82\nFigure 14: A parametrization of reciprocal octahedral and hexahedral figures\nand T \u2032 (v \u20321 , v \u20322 , v \u20323 , v \u20324 , v \u20325 , v \u20326 ) as defined above give rise to the algebraic identities\n\u03b112 \u03b134 \u03b156\n=1\n\u03b123 \u03b145 \u03b161\n\u03b14 \u03b15\n\u03b12 \u03b13\n+ \u03b14 + \u03b15 +\n=0\n\u03b12 + \u03b13 +\n\u03b11\n\u03b16\n\n(9.12)\n\nM (P1 , P2 , P3 , P4 , P5 , P6 ) = M (P1\u2032 , P2\u2032 , P3\u2032 , P4\u2032 , P5\u2032 , P6\u2032 ).\nEven though there exist four pairs of parallel hexagons and twelve pairs of\nparallel figures T and T \u2032 , only six of the identities (9.12)1,2 are independent.\nMoreover, the relations (9.12)1,3 are identical by virtue of the definitions (9.8).\nIn the context of octahedral and hexahedral integrable lattices (cf. Section 9.2),\nthese may be satisfied identically by introducing 'tau-functions'. The remaining (three) relations (9.12)2 are interpreted once again as a discrete integrable\nsystem.\n\n9.1\n\nAn algebraic characterization\n\nThe octahedral figure 3(a) may be obtained from the (6, 10) figure 10(a) by\nadding the edges 11 and 12. From a combinatorial point of view, this amounts\nto replacing each of the vertices \u03c8 1 and \u03c8 2 in the reciprocal figure 10(b) by an\nedge and two vertices. Accordingly, it is natural to adopt the parametrization\nshown in Figure 14. Indeed, if the vertices \u03c71 , \u03c72 and \u03c8 1 , \u03c8 2 coincide then\nFigure 14(b) reduces to Figure 10(b). The conditions of parallelism are now\nnaturally split into the two groups of linear equations\n\u03a612 \u2212 \u03a6 = a(\u03a61 \u2212 \u03a62 ),\n\n\u03c71 \u2212 \u03a6 = d(\u03a61 \u2212 \u03c8)\n\n\u03a613 \u2212 \u03c8 = b(\u03c71 \u2212 \u03a63 ),\n\n\u03c72 \u2212 \u03a6 = e(\u03a62 \u2212 \u03c8)\n\n\u03a623 \u2212 \u03c8 = c(\u03c72 \u2212 \u03a63 )\n28\n\n(9.13)\n\n\fand\n\u03a6123 \u2212 \u03a63 = a3 (\u03a613 \u2212 \u03a623 ),\n\n\u03c712 \u2212 \u03a62 = d2 (\u03a612 \u2212 \u03c8 2 )\n\n\u03a6123 \u2212 \u03c8 2 = b2 (\u03c712 \u2212 \u03a623 ),\n\n\u03c712 \u2212 \u03a61 = e1 (\u03a612 \u2212 \u03c8 1 )\n\n(9.14)\n\n\u03a6123 \u2212 \u03c8 1 = c1 (\u03c712 \u2212 \u03a613 )\nand the pair\n\u03c8 1 \u2212 \u03c71 = g(\u03a613 \u2212 \u03a61 )\n\n(9.15)\n\n\u03c8 2 \u2212 \u03c72 = h(\u03a623 \u2212 \u03a62 )\n\nwith real dilations a, b, c, d, e, a3 , b2 , c1 , d2 , e1 and g, h. Elimination of \u03c712 and\n\u03a6123 from (9.14) leads to three relations of the form\nE 1k (\u03a61 \u2212 \u03c8) + E 2k (\u03a62 \u2212 \u03c8) + E 3k (\u03a63 \u2212 \u03a6) = 0,\n\nk = 1, 2, 3,\n\n(9.16)\n\nwhere the real coefficients E ik are given in terms of the dilations. In contrast\nto the cases discussed in the preceding, these relations do not imply that the\ncoefficients E ik must vanish. However, in view of a connection with discrete\nintegrable systems, it is canonical to assume that\nE ik = 0.\n\n(9.17)\n\nIt turns out that only six of the latter conditions on the dilations are independent. If we now regard the vertices \u03a6, \u03a61 , \u03a62 , \u03a63 and \u03c8 as given then the\nsystem (9.13)-(9.15) is compatible modulo (9.16). Since we have five points and\nsix dilations at our disposal, the class of reciprocal octahedral and hexahedral\nfigures constructed in this manner contains sixteen arbitrary real parameters.\nOn the other hand, it is not difficult to show that any octahedral figure is represented by this class. Accordingly, if we specify an octahedral figure and the\npoint \u03a6, say, then there exist two degrees of freedom in the construction of the\nhexahedral reciprocal. Thus, if we neglect the usual arbitrary scaling then the\nfollowing theorem obtains:\nTheorem 8 (Construction of one-parameter families of reciprocal\noctahedral and hexahedral figures.) Any octahedral figure admits a oneparameter family of hexahedral reciprocals with E ik = 0, that is\na3 bd = b2 d2 a,\n\na3 ce = c1 e1 a,\n\nb2 eg = c1 dh\n\n1\n1 1\nde\n+ \u2212 =\n+d\u2212e\na3 bc b\nc\na\n1\nae1\n+\n\u2212 a = ceh + e \u2212 h\nd2\nd2\n1\ne\n1\nd\n\u2212 +d =\n\u2212 + e,\nbg\nb\nch c\n\n29\n\n(9.18)\n\n\fwhere the real dilations a, . . . , h are defined by (9.13)-(9.15). The vertices of\nthese figures obey the multi-ratio relations\nM (\u03a623 , \u03a613 , \u03c8, \u03a61 , \u03a62 , \u03c712 ) = M (\u03a6123 , \u03a63 , \u03c71 , \u03a6, \u03a612 , \u03c8 2 )\nM (\u03a613 , \u03a623 , \u03c8, \u03a62 , \u03a61 , \u03c712 ) = M (\u03a6123 , \u03a63 , \u03c72 , \u03a6, \u03a612 , \u03c8 1 )\n\n(9.19)\n\nM (\u03c712 , \u03a623 , \u03a62 , \u03c8, \u03a61 , \u03a613 ) = M (\u03a6123 , \u03c8 2 , \u03c72 , \u03a6, \u03c71 , \u03c8 1 ).\nConversely, let \u03a6, \u03a61 , \u03a62 , \u03a63 , \u03c8 be five generic points on the complex plane,\na, b, c, d, e, g be six arbitrary non-vanishing real numbers and a3 , b2 , c1 , d2 , e1 , h\nbe given by (9.18). Then, the linear system (9.13)-(9.15) is compatible and the\npoints \u03c8, \u03c712 , \u03a61 , \u03a62 , \u03a613 , \u03a623 and \u03c8 1 , \u03c8 2 , \u03c71 , \u03c72 , \u03a6, \u03a63 , \u03a612 , \u03a6123 constitute the\nvertices of a reciprocal pair of octahedral and hexahedral figures.\nThe relations (9.18) are nothing but a set of six independent relations of\nthe form (9.12)1,2 . Similarly, the multi-ratio relations (9.19) constitute three\nindependent relations of the type (9.12)3 . In this connection, it is emphasized\nthat for a given octahedral figure, the multi-ratio conditions (9.12)3 define the\none-parameter family of hexahedral reciprocals.\n\n9.2\n\nIntegrable lattices\n\nIn the case of reciprocal triangles and (6, 10) figures, the reciprocals are of the\nsame type as the original figures. Accordingly, the associated pairs of integrable\nlattices consist of two lattices of the same kind. In the present situation, the reciprocal figures exhibit different combinatorics. It would therefore be natural to\nseek two lattices which consist of octahedral and hexahedral figures respectively.\nHere, we adopt an alternative approach and consider two correlated lattices of\nthe same kind, each of which contains both octahedral and hexahedral figures.\nThus, we are concerned with lattices of the form\n\u03a6(0) : G(0) \u2192 C,\n\n\u03a6(1) : G(1) \u2192 C,\n\n(9.20)\n\nwhere the set G(0) is given by\nG(0) = {(n1 , n2 , n4 ) \u2208 Z3 : n4 = 0 mod 3 if n1 + n2 even\nn4 = 1, 2 mod 3 if n1 + n2 odd}\n\n(9.21)\n\nand G(1) is the complement of G(0) . The edge structure of G(0) and G(1) is\nobtained by alternating the octahedron and hexahedron displayed in Figure 15\nin the two horizontal directions. In the vertical direction, polyhedra of the same\ntype are stacked on top of each other. Thus, the lattices \u03a6(0) and \u03a6(1) possess\nthe combinatorics of three-dimensional hybrids of octahedral and hexahedral\nlattices. In order to show that the relations (9.18) may be interpreted as a\ndiscrete integrable system defined on these lattices of non-trivial combinatorics,\nit is once again convenient to combine the (vertices of the) lattices \u03a6(i) to one\nlattice\n\u03a6\u0302(n) = \u03a6(i) (n) if n \u2208 G(i) , n = (n1 , n2 , n4 )\n(9.22)\n30\n\n\f2444\n\n444\n\n12444\n\n1244\n\n244\n144\n44\n\n124\n\n124\n\n24\n\n14\n\n14\n\n4\n12\n\n2\n\n0\n\n1244\n\n144\n24\n\n4\n\n12444\n\n1444\n\n444\n\n244\n1444\n\n44\n\n2444\n\n12\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n\n1\n\nFigure 15: The building blocks of G(0) and G(1)\nand introduce the notation\n\u03a6(n1 , n2 , n3 ) = \u03a6\u0302(n1 , n2 , 3n3 ),\n\n\u03c8(n1 , n2 , n3 ) = \u03a6\u0302(n1 , n2 , 3n3 + 1)\n\n\u03c7(n1 , n2 , n3 ) = \u03a6\u0302(n1 , n2 , 3n3 + 2).\n\n(9.23)\n\nIf we now regard indices on objects as shifts along corresponding edges then\nthe algebraic system (9.13)-(9.15) may be regarded as a system of linear difference equations for the lattices \u03a6(0) and \u03a6(1) encapsulated in the fields \u03a6, \u03c8\nand \u03c7. The compatibility conditions which guarantee the existence of \u03a6 and \u03c7\nare given by (9.16) and are therefore satisfied if we assume that E ik = 0. The\ncompatibility condition (\u03c8 1 )2 = (\u03c8 2 )1 applied to the pair (9.15) results in the\nadditional constraint\ng 2 = h1 .\n(9.24)\nThe latter and the relations (9.18)1,2,3 , regarded as difference equations, give\nrise to a parametrization of the dilations in terms of 'tau-functions' \u03c4, \u03ba and \u03bd\naccording to\n\u03ba1 \u03c43\n\u03ba2 \u03c43\n\u03c41 \u03c42\n, b=\n, c=\n\u03c4 \u03c412\n\u03bd\u03c413\n\u03bd\u03c423\n\u03bd\u03c41\n\u03c42 \u03c423\n\u03bd\u03c42\n\u03c41 \u03c413\nd=\n, h=\n.\n, e=\n, g=\n\u03ba1 \u03c4\n\u03ba2 \u03c4\n\u03ba 1 \u03bd1\n\u03ba 2 \u03bd2\na=\n\n(9.25)\n\nThe remaining relations (9.18)4,5,6 then reduce to a 'trilinear' integrable system\nwith (9.13), (9.15) being its linear representation.

Whether this property is generic to reciprocal\nfigures and to what extent reciprocal figures may be extended to integrable\nlattices of diverse combinatorics is currently under investigation.\n\nReferences\n[1] R.K.
