Introduction\nThe relationship between the spectrum of certain natural operators of Laplace\ntype and the underlying geometry of a Riemannian manifold has been studied\nby many authors. Let (M, g) be a compact Riemannian manifold with smooth\nboundary \u2202M . Let V be a smooth Hermitian vector bundle over M and let D\nbe a formally self-adjoint operator of Laplace type acting on the space of smooth\nsections C \u221e (V ). Let DB denote the realization of D with respect to either the\nDirichlet (B = BD ) or the Neumann (B = BN ) boundary operators. Then DB is\nself-adjoint and has a complete discrete spectral resolution S(DB ) = {(\u03c6\u03bd , \u03bb\u03bd )}.\nThe \u03c6\u03bd \u2208 C \u221e (V ) form a complete orthonormal basis forL2 (V ) such that\nD\u03c6\u03bd = \u03bb\u03bd \u03c6\u03bd\n\nand B\u03c6\u03bd = 0.\n\nWe let the spectrum Spec(DB ) = {\u03bb\u03bd } be the collection of eigenvalues.

Extend the\nmetric g to be Hermitian on the complexified tangent bundle. Let \u2207 be the LeviCivita connection.

Let (M, g, J) be a compact Kaehler manifold without boundary of\ncomplex dimension m\u0302. Then \u2206 = 2 \u2293\n\u2294 and so Spec(\u2206p ) = Spec(2 \u2293\n\u2294p ) for all p.\nConversely, one has the following result to T. Tsujishita (reported by Gilkey [8]):\nTheorem 1.2. Let (M, g, J) be a compact Hermitian manifold without boundary.\nIf Spec(\u22060 ) = Spec(2\u2293\n\u22940 ) and if Spec(\u22061 ) = Spec(2\u2293\n\u22941 ), then (M, g, J) is Kaehler.\nDonnelly [2] established a similar characterization of the Kaehler property using\nthe reduced complex Laplacian. Pak [12] extended these results to the context of\nalmost isospectral manifolds.\nTheorem 1.2 is sharp. We refer to Gilkey [7] for the proof of the following result:\nTheorem 1.3. Let ds2 = dz1 \u25e6dz\u03041 +e\u03c8(z1 ) dz2 \u25e6dz\u03042 +e\u2212\u03c8(z1 ) dz3 \u25e6dz\u03043 be a Hermitian\nmetric on the torus M3 where \u03c8(z1 ) is an arbitrary smooth real valued function.\nThen \u22060 = 2 \u2293\n\u22940 but the metric is not Kaehler.\nA Riemannian manifold of constant sectional curvature c is said to be a space\nform; a Kaehler manifold of constant holomorphic sectional curvature c is said to\nbe a complex space form. Modulo rescaling, any space form is locally isometric to\nthe unit sphere, to flat space, or to hyperbolic space. Similarly, modulo rescaling,\nany complex space form is locally isometric to complex projective space, to flat\nspace, or to the negative curvature dual. Thus the geometries are very rigid in this\ncontext.\nPatodi [11] established the following spectral characterization of space forms:\nTheorem 1.4. Let (Mi , gi ) be compact Riemannian manifolds without boundary.\nAssume that Spec(\u2206p , M1 ) = Spec(\u2206p , M2 ) for 0 \u2264 p \u2264 2.

Then\nthe manifold M1 has constant holomorphic sectional curvature c if and only if the\nmanifold M2 has constant holomorphic sectional curvature c.\nWe can extend Theorem 1.2 to manifolds with boundary:\nTheorem 1.6. Let B denote either Dirichlet or Neumann boundary conditions. Let\n(M, g, J) be a compact Hermitian manifold with smooth boundary \u2202M . Assume that\nSpec(\u22060,B ) = Spec(2 \u2293\n\u22940,B ) and that Spec(\u22061,B ) = Spec(2 \u2293\n\u22941,B ). Then (M, g, J) is\nKaehler.\nWe can also generalize Theorems 1.4 and 1.5 to the category of manifolds with\nboundary under the additional technical hypothesis that the manifolds in question\nhave constant scalar curvature.\nTheorem 1.7. Let B denote either Dirichlet or Neumann boundary conditions.\nLet (Mi , gi ) be compact Riemannian manifolds with smooth boundaries \u2202Mi which\nhave constant scalar curvatures \u03c4i .

Then the manifold M1 has constant holomorphic sectional curvature c if and only if the manifold M2 has constant holomorphic sectional\ncurvature c.\nHere is a brief outline to the remainder of this paper. In Section 2, we review\nsome previous results concerning the heat trace asymptotics. In Section 3, we\ncomplete the proof of Theorem 1.6 and in Section 4, we complete the proof of\nTheorems 1.7 and 1.8. In Remark 4.1, we extend Theorems 1.7 and 1.8 to more\ngeneral boundary conditions of Robin type where the auxiliary endomorphism S is\n'universal' in a certain sense.\nIt is a pleasant task to thank the referee for helpful suggestions concerning the\nmanuscript.\n\n\f4\n\nJEONGHYEONG PARK\n\n2.

Let e\u2212tDB be the\nfundamental solution of the heat equation. This operator is of trace class and as\nt \u2193 0 there is a complete asymptotic expansion with locally computable coefficients\nin the form:\nP\nTrL2 e\u2212tDB \u223c n\u22650 t(n\u2212m)/2 an (D, B).\nTo study the heat trace coefficients an (D, B), we must introduce a bit of additional notation. There is a canonically defined connection \u2207 = \u2207(D) and a\ncanonically defined endomorphism E = E(D) so that\nD = \u2212(Tr(\u22072 ) + E).\n\nLet indices i, j, k range from 1 to m and index a local orthonormal frame\n{e1 , ..., em } for T M . Let indices a, b, and c range from 1 to m \u2212 1 and index a\nlocal orthonormal frame {e1 , ..., em\u22121 } for T \u2202M ; on \u2202M , we let em be the inward\nunit normal vector field.
