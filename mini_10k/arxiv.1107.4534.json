Of course this question refers, at least implicitly, to the\n'ultimate' nature of reality, the fundamental layer. I do not know what this could mean,\nnor I am at ease with thinking in these terms. Therefore, the closest I can get to the\nissue of the digital/analog nature of reality is to consider a special physical system that\nis, in some sense, the most fundamental of all: space.\nThe question I will focus on in this essay, then, will be: is space digital or analog? What\nis the best language to understand/describe (quantum) space?\nI offer a tentative perspective on this issue, making use of some of the ideas and mathematical models that form the basis of my own work as a quantum gravity theorist. Also,\nI will translate the above question into a slightly different one:\nis (quantum) space discrete or continuous?\n1\n\n\fHere is my goal: I will phrase the question within a speculative scenario for quantum\ngravity, one that is based on an analogy of space with a condensed matter system, and\ntry convince on this basis that the question makes no (absolute) sense.\nThis may seem no solid basis for an argument, but I assure the reader that this is not\ngoing to be (at least, this is not the intention) a Chewbacca defence [1]. The aim is to\nmake sense of the question in the context of a current quantum gravity model, and to\nopen up a richer perspective on it and on the nature of space itself.\nOur current understanding of physical space is encodedin General Relativity (GR).\nHere space is a continuous system, modeled by a smooth metric 3d manifold, deeply\nintertwined with time, to form a smooth metric 4d manifold, of given topology and\nminkowskian signature. The geometry of space is dynamical, and this dynamical nature\nturns space into a physical system on its own, thus subject to further scrutiny. We also\nknow, from a variety of physical arguments, that this is not the end of the story [2].\nWhat can a 'discrete'space mean? As soon as we leave the above description of space,\nit is not obvious that we can still speak of the physical system as being space anymore.\nFor example, replacing the smooth manifold structure with some discrete substratum,\nwe loose at once all the defining properties (dimension, signature, topology) nor it is\nguaranteed that they will turn into their continuum analogue in any approximation.\nThe question becomes: can we define a physical system, that has no feature of space\nin itself, such that, in some appropriate (dynamical) regime, it will be described by\na space, identified, now, with a smooth manifold? If not, we will not have a more\nfundamental notion of the physical system we call space, and the discrete/continuum\nissue will then be settled. If we do, then we will be forced to pose again the question in\nthe context of this new, more general description of this new, more fundamental system,\nthat 'looks like'space in some limited regime. This is why I think it is necessary to\npose the question in the context of a specific, if tentative, model of what I will call (for\nsimplicity) quantum space, and of a specific, if speculative, interpretational framework.\nBefore we start, let me add a few cautionary remarks.\nOne risk that I will try to avoid is the confusion between physical distinction of different regimes of a physical system and of its dynamics, and the philosophical distinction\nbetween different levels of reality, or different ontologies. In particular, the question of\nthe discrete vs continuous nature of quantum space will be addressed in the first context,\nrather than in the second. Similarly, the problem of the emergence of a set of properties of quantum space, at one level of description, from a different (more fundamental?)\none will be sketched in its possible physical/scientific aspects, in the specific models\nof quantum space I favor, leaving the philosophical reflection on the respective role of\n\n2\n\n\freductionism and emergentism [6] to a later stage.\nThe issue of digital/analog nature of Nature, even in the discrete/continuous translation, as well as the related issue of emergentism vs reductionism, are very complicated\non their own, in any specific chosen context [6]. Space is itself a very difficult subject of\nreflections, for its elusive and at the same time ubiquitous nature. Quantum gravity is\nan even weirder case study, because it already poses numerous and very difficult philosophical challenges on its own, in part coming directly from its supposed ingredients:\nGeneral relativity and Quantum Mechanics [3, 4, 5]. I will not address these challenges,\nincluding any issue related to the interpretation of quantum theory when applied to\nspace itself.\nMore practically, I will discuss the issue of the nature of space without considering\nmatter (fermions or gauge interactions) in the picture. This is for simplicity only, but\ncould be questioned [7].\nI will not touch the thorny issue of the emergence of time or of the discrete or\ncontinuous nature of the same. In any quantum gravity context, the role of time is\nsubtle to say the least [8], and will bring further complications. In particular, I will\nargue under the assumption that the issue of discrete/continuous nature of space can\nbe disentangled from the same issue about time. Also, I will leave aside the issue of the\nemergence of time from a regime in which there is no notion of space at all. This absence\ncould be an additional difficulty to our fundamental understanding of time [8, 9] or a\nway out of the traditional difficulties [10]\nIn fact, the models of quantum gravity I deal with force us to think in the context of\n'no space', of absence of space, and the issue I will discuss is the extent to which, within\nthese models, one can recover a notion of space at all, and then whether 'the stuff it\nemerges from'is best understood as discrete or continuous.\nFinally, I will be taking a 'realist'standpoint concerning the peculiar physical system\nthat is quantum space. However, this will be done for greater agility of exposition, but\nwill not necessarily imply any endorsement of it from the philosophical side.\nFor all of the above, it is clear that very many issues will be left aside, and left for\nfuture elaboration. I apologize for this.\n\n3\n\n\fQuantum gravity perspectives on quantum space\nThere is no necessity, coming from either General Relativity or quantum mechanics\nalone, to deny the smooth structure of space on which they are based. Even curvature\nsingularities in GR are not, per se, an indication that the smooth structure has be\ndisposed of. And quantum mechanics rests on this undisturbed smooth structure in all\nits successful applications. There are however independent reasons why the classical GR\ndescription of space, neglecting quantum properties of the same, could not suffice [2].\nSeveral arguments, then, indicate that the application of quantum mechanics to\nspace itself may lead to the mathematical or physical impossibility of a point-like, thus\ncontinuous substratum for space and geometry: the possibility of forming microscopic\nblack hole in the attempt to resolve points using high energy probes, the necessity of\nquantum fluctuations in the metric structure, and thus in the determination of distances\nand causal relations between points, and so on [2, 3].\nAn emergent, approximate validity of a continuous description of space (as in GR)\nis, however, the natural starting point of any radical approach to quantum gravity\n[12, 13, 14] that aims at explaining the origin of space, its (more) fundamental structure,\nfrom something that, by definition, then, cannot be described in terms of continuous\nspace and geometry. The one perspective that does not share this attitude is the one that\nsees the problem of quantum gravity as the problem of quantizing General Relativity.\nThis is the case, for example, of loop quantum gravity (LQG), including (at least in\nspirit) its covariant formulation in terms of spin foam models (see [16] for extensive\ntreatments). However surprises come, as often, from unexpected corners. Even within\nthe canonical approach, an immediate hint that some discrete structure of space results\nsimply from the quantization process is the discrete spectrum of (kinematical) geometric\nobservables like areas and volumes. This is the analogue of the discretization following\nquantization of, say, the energy spectrum of the hydrogen atom. Even more important,\nin LQG, a generic wave function of the quantum gravitational field turns out to be a\nsuperposition of excitations of the same living on graphs, thus purely discrete structures.\nSo to speak, there is no space outside these graphs and the data labeling them. Thus\npurely discrete structures are suggested as the true substratum of quantum space even in\napproaches that aim at simply bringing together in full General relativity and Quantum\nMechanics. A similar discourse can be made for simplicial quantum gravity approaches\n[17]. These start as straightforward implementations of the quantum gravitational path\nintegral, by means of a regularization of both geometry and GR dynamics using simplicial\nlattices. Still, in practice one finds oneself with a quantum theory of discrete structures,\nfrom which a continuum space with continuum GR dynamics should only emerge in a\nlimit in which an infinity of these discrete structures interact. Thus, continuum space\n4\n\n\fends up being once more an emergent construction from more fundamental structures\nthat are not continuum, not space [17].\nThus we learn two lessons: 1) the disposal of the current continuum definition of\nspace in favor of something different, possibly discrete, can be the natural outcome of\nstraightforward joining of Quantum mechanics and General Relativity; 2) the very same\nstructures that one arrives at in doing so admit a more radical re-interpretation than\ninitially devised. Group field theories use the same discrete structures of LQG and\nsimplicial quantum gravity, suggesting a radical re-interpretation of them, and, we will\nargue, a vastly richer perspective on the discrete/continuum nature of quantum space.\n\nThe basic analogy: condensed matter systems\nThe analogy that sheds a new light on the question of the discrete/continuous nature\nof quantum space is to see it as a condensed matter system, a weird 'material medium'.\nThis radical idea is not new. It has been advocated in [18], the similarities of GR\nwith elasticity theory in solids have been described in [19], the possibility of deriving\nthe Einstein's equations for the dynamics of space as an equation of state for some\nunderlying microscopic system has been studied in [20], the unreasonable attitude of\ntreating space as a \"non-substance with substance-like properties\"has been criticized in\n[22], several studies of analogue gravity systems in condensed matter show that some\nproperties of our space emerge naturally in a variety of 'less fundamental'systems [21].\nThis set of results suggests that space itself can be understood as a kind of Aether (a\nmedium-substance) that is, however, relativistic (at least up to Planckian scales), whose\nstructure has to be described in background independent manner, and is fundamentally\nquantum in nature. The physical question, then, becomes what constitutes it, what it\nlooks like at microscopic scales. The novelty is now that this idea has the possibility of\nbeing realized rigorously, within a fastly developing quantum gravity approach: group\nfield theory.\nSuppose I give you a condensed matter system, the assembly of a huge number of\ngiven building blocks of some type, somehow holding together: a bucket of superfluid\nHelium, or simply a tank of water. Now I ask: is it discrete or continuous?\nThe first point to notice is that this is a physical question. It amounts to ask whether\nthe best mathematical description of the system, that is able of reproducing or predicting\nits physical properties, is given in terms of discrete or continuous entities. Second, the\ntrue answer to the above question, when posed in these terms, is: it depends. Whether\nthe physical system considered is best described as discrete or continuous depends on\ntwo set of things: what is the range of physical macroscopic, thermodynamic parameters\n5\n\n\fat which we are considering the system, and the observation scale we adopt. The first\naspect has to do with the phase in which the system is, and we know well that its\nphysical properties are going to be very different in different phases, including its being\nwell described as a continuous or a discrete medium. The second has to do with the fact\nthat, even within a given phase, the observation scale one uses affects which properties\nof the system are relevant and which negligible, and what type of description is best\nsuited to adopt them.\nThink of water in a bucket. Is it discrete or continuous? First of all I have to pose\nthe question within a certain thermodynamic phase. At higher temperature, say 600K,\nand given pressure, say 106 Pascals, the substance we call water is a gas, which can be\ndescribed by a fluid with very low density and high kinetic energy, a continuous system\npossibly homogeneous and isotropic. At lower temperature, say around 350K, and same\npressure, we find again a continuous fluid, a liquid (the thing we normally call water),\nwith much lower kinetic energy, higher density and very different physical properties\n(interaction with matter or light, etc), possibly still homogenous and isotropic. The best\ndescription of it will be given by a continuum field theory, hydrodynamics, for the density\nand the velocity of the whole fluid. At even lower temperature, say below 200K, the\nsame system will look and behave very different; it will be a solid, a crystal usually called\n'ice', which is rigid, does not flow like water, and has lost the continuum symmetries.\nIts best description will then be that of a discrete structure, an hexagonal lattice, and\nthe interaction with other systems will now be different. So, is the system we call water\ndiscrete or continuous? In a very strict sense, what we call water is the liquid, continuous\nphase of the system, so it is continuous by definition, as we suggested for physical space.\nIn a broader sense, it depends. It depends on the phase in which the system resides,\nwhich in turns depends on the macroscopic parameters characterizing it. Obviously,\nwhat we said for water holds true for any condensed matter system, say a quantum fluid\nlike a Bose condensate, and the main problem of condensed matter theory is, given a\ncertain physical system, to identify and characterize the various phases in which it can\nbe found, the physical properties of each phase, and the transitions between phases, by\nmethods of statistical field theory, e.g. the renormalization group or mean field theory.\nThe same could be true for quantum space.\nLet me counter-argue a possible objection to the above argument: \"Sure, at macroscopic scales a condensed matter system like water or a Bose fluid may look continuous,\nat least in some phases, and the discrete/continuum dichotomy is not a fundamental\none, but something dependent on the phase one finds the system in; however, fundamentally the system is discrete, because it is made up of molecules or atoms, which are\nthe fundamental, quantum building blocks of it, and the macroscopic phases are just\n\n6\n\n\fdifferent ways in which these fundamental building blocks organize themselves\".\nIn particular, one may point out the aspect of observation scale. At smaller scales or\nhigher energies, we know that the hydrodynamic, continuum description of a fluid fails.\nA different type of description is needed, in terms of the microscopic constituents, atoms\nor molecules. Indeed, it is a fact, although a non-trivial one (it is not easy to specify\nclearly what we mean by 'made of', by 'just organize themselves'etc), and I tend not to\nquarrel with facts. Still, I do not think it changes the answer to the question; it leads to\nrefining it further. I have two problems with the idea that a condensed matter system\nis fundamentally discrete because it is made of atoms. The first is conceptual. This\npoint of view rests on a certain reductionism that I accept, like most physicists [23, 24],\nbut still find in need for further analysis. More important, it also seems to rest on a\nconstructivist ideology, i.e. on the assumption that, at least as a matter of principle, it\nwould be possible to reconstruct or derive all properties of the macroscopic system, the\ncollective behaviour of large numbers of microscopic building blocks, from a good enough\ndescription of them. This is really the point of view that the 'emergentist'paradigm [6]\nopposes. My point here is that this is more of a philosophical issue, rather than a physical\none, and a subtle one as well, so our scientific answer cannot rely on it, in the even\nsubtler case of quantum space. The second, more important problem I have is with the\nidea that the microscopic building blocks of a condensed matter systems are themselves\nfundamentally discrete. It seems to me that also this is not absolutely true, that 'it\ndepends'. This is simply because, before any further approximations, of limited validity\nby definition, the framework for describing the microscopic properties and dynamics of\nthe very building blocks of any condensed matter system is quantum field theory, in\nwhich the atoms are quanta of a continuous field. One can speak of individual quanta\nwithin a specific presentation of the field theory, the Fock representation, and, from the\nphysical point of view, when only a finite (possible small) number of excitations around\nthe Fock vacuum (atoms) are relevant. The question whether the system, at microscopic\nscales, is discrete or continuous boils down once more to a matter of convenience of a\ncertain physical description over another, equally fundamental. It also becomes tied to\nthe physical question of whether the regime in which only a limited number of atoms\nexists, i.e. only a few quanta of the field are excited, is experimentally accessible, or to\nthe other physical question of whether some specific property of the system as a whole\ncan be traced back directly to the atoms. And again, even this description was relevant,\nit would be so only in some specific physical situation, to capture some specific features\nof the physical system.\nSo, is the system discrete or continuous?\nIt depends.\n\n7\n\n\fA candidate theory of atoms of quantum space\nThe idea I am arguing for is that of quantum space as a kind of condensate [26], made of\n'fundamental'building blocks that cannot be understood, in themselves, in terms of the\nordinary notions of space or time. Moreover, I am arguing that, from this perspective,\nthe question whether quantum space is discrete or continuous makes no absolute sense,\ni.e. it has to be answered differently in different physical contexts, as for any other\ncondensed matter system. This last point, as shown, rests on the fact that even the\nmicroscopic building blocks of a condensed matter system are best described in the\ncontext of quantum field theory.\nIn fact, we do have a candidate QFT formalism for the microscopic structure of\nquantum space: group field theory (GFT) [25] I will now sketch its basic features.\nWe could motivate the GFT framework from several other approaches: matrix models, simplicial gravity, loop quantum gravity [25]. LQG [16] starts from the reformulation\nof GR in terms of SU(2) connection variables and conjugate triad fields in the continuum.\nStill, one ends up with a Hilbert space decomposed into sums of cylindrical functions\nwhich only depend on a finite number of holonomies (group elements g), associated to a\ngiven graph For the same quantum states, one can define two other representations: a\nnon-commutative flux representation [11], in which the links of the graph are labelled by\nLie algebra elements x of SU(2), representing triads, and one in which links are labelled\nby SU(2) representations j, quantum numbers of geometric operators.\nNow imagine decomposing the (say, trivalent) graphs into their constituting (open)\nvertices with corresponding re-arranging of labels, so that instead of a graph we now\nhave a collection of open vertices with some 'gluing'relations defining the original graph.\n2\n\ng\n\n\u0393\n\n2\n\n2\n\ng2\n\n1\n\ng\n\n2\n\ng\n\n12\n\n23\n\ng\n\n1\n\ng2\n\n1\n\n1\n\n3\n\ng1\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n3\n\ng1\n3\n\ng\n34\n\n4\n\n4\n\nThese are the fundamental LQG building blocks of quantum space: combinatorial\nstructures with associated fundamental degrees of freedom being purely algebraic.\nSimplicial quantum gravity comes into play because the same vertices can be understood as combinatorially dual to triangles with the same associated degrees of freedom.\nThe corresponding wave functions for arbitrary graphs would then be interpreted as\nwave functions associated to a simplicial 2d space in a discrete quantum gravity approach based on connection variables. For individual vertices one would then have wave\nfunctions and graphical representation as:\n8\n\n\fg (j )\n1\n1\n\ng (j )\n1\n\n\u03c6 (g1\n\ng\n\n2\n\ng\n\n3\n\n)\n\n\u03c6( j\n\n1\n\nj j\n2\n\n3\n\ng (j )\n2\n\n2\n\ng (j )\n2\n\ng (j )\n\n1\n\n2\n\n)\n\n2\n\n2\n\ng (j )\n1\n1\n\ng (j )\n3\n3\n\ng (j )\n3\n\ng (j )\n\n3\n\n3\n\n3\n\nThis means that the same wave function can be understood as defining a possible\nstate of a quantized simplex, i.e. a chunk of quantum space, in a discrete approach to\nquantum gravity [27, 25]. A similar reinterpretation is available in higher dimensions\n[16, 25].\nNow, take these simple structures seriously as the definition of the building blocks,\nthe atoms, of quantum space. A generic configuration of quantum space would be given by\nan arbitrary number of them. Consider the case in which such number is not conserved,\nbut they can be created/annihilated (that is, the combinatorial structure of a generic\nconfiguration of quantum space varies) or top of changing their associated labels (in the\nsame sense in which atoms can vary their position, energy, etc). The natural dynamical\nframework would then be that of a quantum field theory, in which the single-vertex wave\nfunction becomes a quantum field. This is a GFT [25].\nAs in LQG, we have three equivalent representations for the basic field: with group\nvariables, with Lie algebra variables and with representation variables [16, 25, 11]:\n\u03c6(g1 , g2 , g3) \u2194 \u03c6(x1 , x2 , x3 ) \u2194 \u03c6jm11j2mj32 m3\nThe interpretation of the x variables is that of elementary edge vectors associated to\nthe edges of the quantized triangle, that of the g variables is of parallel transports of the\ngravity connection along links of the dual graph vertex, and that of the representation\nparameters j, m is that of quantum numbers of geometry.\nThe convolution of multiple fields represents the gluing of triangles or graph vertices\nalong common edges or links, and thus the formation of more complex discrete structures,\nrepresenting extended configurations of quantum space.\ng ( J 4)\n4\n\ng ( J 4)\n4\ng ( J 1)\n1\n\ng ( J 1)\n1\ng ( J )\n\ng ( J )\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\ng ( J )\n3\n\n3\n\ng ( J )\n3\n\ng ( J )\n\ng ( J )\n5\n\n5\n\n5\n\n9\n\n5\n\n3\n\n\fThe GFT dynamics is dictated by very minimal considerations. Noting \u03c6123 :=\n\u03c6(x1 , x2 , x3 ) we define, schematically, the action [25, 11]\nZ\nZ\n\u03bb\n1\n\u03c6123 \u03c6123 \u2212\n\u03c6123 \u03c6345 \u03c6526 \u03c6641\n(0.1)\nS=\n2\n4!\nIn the interaction, four triangles are glued to form a tetrahedron by edge identification. The kinetic term glues two tetrahedra along a common triangle.\nThe quantum theory is then defined by the perturbative expansion of the partition\nfunction in powers of the coupling constant \u03bb.\nZ\nX \u03bbN\nZ =\nD\u03c6 e\u2212S[\u03c6] =\nZ(\u0393),\nsym[\u0393]\n\u0393\nwhere N is the number of interaction vertices in the Feynman diagram \u0393, sym[\u0393] is a\nsymmetry factor for \u0393 and Z(\u0393) the corresponding Feynman amplitude.\nBy the combinatorial structure of vertices and propagators, the Feynman diagrams\nwill be dual to 3d simplicial complexes, i.e. a primitive, discrete version of a 'spacetime'.\nLooking at the Feynman amplitudes one sees the link with simplicial quantum gravity\nand loop quantum gravity. In Lie algebra variables, the amplitude Z(\u0393) for a generic\nFeynman diagram is exactly [11] the simplicial path integral of 3d gravity in 1st order\nform. The expression of Z(\u0393) in terms of group representations, in turn, is the PonzanoRegge spin foam model [16], also defining the dynamics of 3d loop quantum gravity.\nThe above construction can be straightforwardly extended to give transition amplitudes between arbitrary configurations of quantum space. A discrete spacetime substratum, then, emerges as a possible interaction process of GFT quanta. The dynamics is\ngiven by a sum over all possible discrete topologies, each weighted by a discrete, algebraic\nversion of the gravity path integral.\nNotice that, while several ingredients from classical GR enter the construction, at\nleast as a motivation, the GFT dynamics is not the result of any straightforward quantization of GR dynamics. Rather, if the GR dynamics is associated, in the analogy,\nwith the hydrodynamics of quantum space, the spacetime equivalent of 0.3, the GFT\ndynamics has to be compared with the microscopic atomic theory of the same system\n0.4.\nSo, in GFT we have a class of models of quantum space, possibly fundamental, that\ndo not share language and structures used in GR description of space. Indeed the main\nproblem becomes to recover this in some limit. How to do so?\nWe most likely need a very large number of GFT quanta to constitute an effectively\ncontinuum region of space, governed by continuum gravitational physics. This is probably governed by collective dynamical laws, not by the microscopic GFT dynamics (the\n10\n\n\fanalogue of 0.4). Finally, whatever the exact details of relevant phase is, we expect our\ncondensed matter system, i.e. quantum space, to be close to equilibrium. This seems just\na description of a peculiar quantum fluid, governed by hydrodynamical equations (the\nanalogue of 0.2). Notice that this continuum approximation is conceptually independent\nof a semi-classical approximation. The emergence of continuum space may even be the\nresult of a purely quantum property of the system.\nThe picture is then the one we had anticipated: quantum spacetime as a (quantum)\nfluid of GFT particles, governed microscopically by the GFT partition function, but\nmacroscopically by some GFT effective hydrodynamics. [26, 30]\nThis is at present just a speculation. It immediately implies one thing, however:\nto recover and describe a continuum space and its dynamics, it is convenient, if not\nnecessary, to go beyond the spin foam or simplicial gravity description of the GFT\nsystem, since the perturbative GFT formulation, in which they appear, is mainly useful\nfor describing the system in its few-particle regime. For collective behaviour, we should\nmove away from the no-particle vacuum.\nInstead, we need to use a statistical group field theory formalism, e.g. renormalization\ngroup ideas, for identifying the different phases of the theory, hoping that some GFT\nmodels lead to the existence of at least one with the right properties for a continuum\ngeometric description. This is what the analogy with condensed matter systems suggests\nfor quantum space. Second, we need to develop first and then use an effective field\ntheory or hydrodynamic description, coming from the fundamental GFT, for describing\nthe dynamics in the different phases, using again tools from condensed matter theory,\ne.g. mean field theory. Work in all these directions, partly motivated by the above\nconsiderations, is well under way [25, 30, 31]. I do not intend to review it here.\nMy goal here is only to highlight, within this speculation, how our picture of space\nwould change, concerning the initial question: is (quantum) space discrete or continuous?\n\n11\n\n\fDiscussion\nWe now discuss in some more detail the physical aspects of the scenario for quantum\nspace we sketched, based on the GFT formalism.\nIs it the return of the Aether? In some sense, it is, as we are arguing that there exists\na sort of weird material medium, filling everything (better, 'constituting everything'),\nhaving its own dynamics and interacting with matter in a way that (at the very least)\ninfluences their respective dynamics. But this is just, in our intention, the appropriate\nreading of: the very content of GR as a theory of space(time) endowing it and its geometry with the characteristics of a dynamical, physical system; 2) the disconnected,\nbut intriguingly converging results mentioned above suggesting the possibility of interpreting in thermodynamic or hydrodynamical terms the same equations of GR; 3) the\ncurrent tentative picture and developed mathematical structures arrived at by several\napproaches to quantum gravity. If it is a sort of Aether, that we are talking about, it\nis a new type of it, a background independent, pre-spacetime kind of condensed matter\nsystem. We are not moving backward from the revolutions of Relativity and Quantum\nMechanics, on the contrary we are trying to move forward on the basis of them.\nThe picture we painted shares a certain spirit with the ideas of gravity as thermoor hydrodynamics, and even more with other background independent approaches to\nquantum gravity, also inspired by condensed matter ideas, e.g. the quantum graphity\nprogramme [13], but it framed in a mathematical framework that is the direct generalization of matrix models of random surfaces [15]. In particular, our proposed scheme\nfor the emergence of continuum geometry from the dynamics of the GFT quanta, as a\nphase transition, can be seen as a sort of geometrogenesis [13].\nOne is naturally led to further speculations about the true meaning of spacetime\nsingularities and the corresponding breakdown of the GR description of space. In an\napproach to quantum gravity guided by the idea of 'quantizing GR'only, this breakdown\nsignals the need to take into account quantum effects of geometry, and, a priori, nothing\nmore. That is, the breakdown of the semi-classical approximation in the description of\na quantum, continuum space. Being more radical, it may also signal the breakdown of\nthe continuum idealization of quantum space. In the condensed matter analogy, this\nwould mean the breakdown of the hydrodynamic description, classical or quantum, of\nthe same, and the need to resort to a more fundamental description of it in terms of its\nbuilding blocks . In the same analogy, one could put also forward the hypothesis that\nsomething even more radical is at play in singularities: a phase transition of quantum\nspace, from a condensed, fluid phase to something completely different, where most of the\ndefining notions of space to fail to apply: locality, and thus local spacetime symmetries,\nthe notion of a fixed dimension, etc. The approach to the transition, could be maybe\n12\n\n\fmodeled by more standard looking, but exotic effective models defined on a continuum\nspace, e.g. field theories with deformed relativistic symmetries [33] or varying speed of\nlight [34], or living on fractals [35]. The idea of a cosmological phase transition of space\nitself, replacing the Big Bang singularity, may provide a novel way to look at the puzzles\nof very early cosmology (horizon problem, flatness problem, etc), currently address by\ninflation, itself in need for a better explanation.\nAlso the 'emergence of space'is not to be understood as happening 'in time', unless:\na) it happens after, mathematically speaking, some degrees of freedom of the system\ndecouple to define a pre-geometric notion of time, e.g. a thermodynamical notion of\ntime, or b) some of the macroscopic (order) parameters that define the phase diagram\nof the GFT system turns out to have the interpretation, at least in the geometric phase\nof the GFT system, of a geometric time.\nNow we come to a rather thorny issue. This is what Laughlin calls the Dark Side of\nProtection [22]. Is the microscopic model that realizes the 'emergence of space'irrelevant\nat least to a large extent? The point is that a number of macroscopic features of a\ncondensed matter system are largely independent of the underlying microscopic physics,\nand are instead universal, e.g. due only to very general symmetry properties and a\nchoice of basic dynamical variables. This is in general a good thing, because it means\nthat we do not need to get the microscopic theory exactly right, whatever that means,\nin order to understand the macroscopic property of the system. In a sense, this is what\nmakes condensed matter theory possible at all, by 'protecting'the interesting macroscopic\nproperties from the microscopic and usually out of control details of the dynamics of the\nbuilding blocks. Something similar could be at work for quantum space. For example,\nif the relevant symmetry property of the continuum phase is diffeomorphism invariance\nand the relevant dynamical variable is the metric field, one could use very efficiently the\nframework of effective field theory [32] for doing quantum gravitational physics even at\nhigh energies. That this is possible is of course a good thing. The danger is that this\ncould be the best we can do, even with a complete model of the microscopic details of\nquantum space. Even if it does not lead to any breakdown of the effective field theory\nframework, such a model would be expected to help us at least predict the constants of\nthe effective field theory for gravity we use at macroscopic scales. But what if even these\nturn out to be largely universal, thus independent of the details that distinguish, say,\none microscopic model from another? how do we compare different microscopic models,\nthen? and is then of any use to have them at all, if only very general properties of them\nare falsifiable? However, one can see the same issue more optimistically. We have, at\npresent, not a single complete candidate for the microscopic theory of quantum space, in\nparticular not single one for which we are able to show how it gives rise to a continuum\n\n13\n\n\fspace at macroscopic scales. Universality can be useful in helping us to identify a class of\nmodels, characterized by very general features (e.g. symmetries, type of variables) that\nsucceed in doing so (e.g. predict the right effective coupling constants, in an effective field\ntheory formulation of quantum gravity, or the correct critical exponents, etc), without\nindeed having to 'get all the details right', and possibly capture them in simplified,\neffective models. Moreover, if the emergence of the correct continuum space is due only\nto some very general properties of the (GFT) atoms of space and of their dynamics,\nthis also means that it is enough to understand this generic link in order to open up an\nentirely new perspective on space and on how it comes about.\nHowever, the physical reality of this atomic level, and the 'fundamental discreteness'of quantum space could be asserted only if it is accessible to direct or indirect\nexperimental test. This is all the more true if we want to claim the existence of, and\nphilosophize about, an entirely different phase for the macroscopic system that quantum\nspace is, one in which the very notion of continuum space is not applicable. This is far\nbeyond the simple-minded difficulty of accessing, by direct experiments, Planck scale\neffects, true for any theory of quantum gravity. One indirect test would be to explain\nsome puzzling (large scale) feature of continuum space (e.g. dark energy?) in terms of\ngeneric properties of its quantum, atomic structure. Having a theory of quantum space\natoms, and being smart enough, we may be surprised to find out that there are plenty\nsuch experimental inputs, even if they do not refer directly to the atomic properties\nof quantum space. As we learned [36], it is often the theory that guides us towards\nrecognizing new phenomena around us, we cannot blindly search for them simply by increasing the resolution or the energy of our probes into nature. Still quantum space can\nbe declared to be discrete only if: a) we have experimental corroboration for a theory\nof the (GFT) quanta of space, and 2) we have access to the 'few particles'regime of the\nsame theory. If we only have access to phenomena depending on the full, field-theoretic,\nand therefore continuous, description of the same atoms/quanta of space, then we could\nnot sensibly declare that space is fundamentally discrete in any sense.\nWe may not achieve the same level of certainty about the nature of quantum space as\nwe have for quantum matter, but we will have found a more interesting reality than we\nnaively assumed in imagining theories of everything or fundamental quantum theories\nof gravity in the traditional sense. We will have to accept and then understand the\nexistence of different levels and phases of reality, and their mutual relations.\nSo, is quantum space continuous or discrete? If the above speculation is right, to\nrealize it concretely will be a revolutionary scientific and cultural experience. But it will\nnot provide us with a better answer to this question than: \"It depends\".\nQuantum space, as the rest of Nature, is much richer and more interesting than we think.\n\n14\n\n\fAppendix\nConsider the basic description, both microscopic and macroscopic, of a very interesting\ncondensed matter system, a Bose condensate of Helium-4 atoms [18]. The hydrodynamic\ndescription of the superfluid phase of the system, after condensation of the atoms has\noccurred [28, 29], is based on the density of fluid \u03c1(x) and the velocity of fluid v(x):\n\n\u2202t \u03c1 = {H, \u03c1} = \u2212\u2207 * (\u03c1v) ,\n\n\u2202t v = {H, v} = \u2212(v * \u2207)v \u2212 \u2207\n\nd\u01eb\n.\nd\u03c1\n\n(0.2)\n\n\u221a\nfor some energy density \u01eb(\u03c1). These equations, for vortex-free flows, and \u03ba\u0304 \u2261 2 K\u03c1,\n\u221a\nv = \u03ba\u0304\u2207\u03b8, \u03a8 = \u03c1ei\u03b8 , with constant K, can derived from the extended Lagrangian (with\ngradient terms):\n\nLGP (\u03c8) =\n\nZ\n\n4\n\ndx\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\u03ba\u03042\ni\u03ba\u0304 \u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n(\u03c8 \u2202t \u03c8 \u2212 \u03c8\u2202t \u03c8 ) + \u2207\u03c8 \u2207\u03c8 + \u01eb(\u03c1) \u2212 \u03bc\u03c1 , \u03c1 = |\u03c8|2 . (0.3)\n2\n2\n\nwhich describes a generalized Gross-Pitaevski hydrodynamics. So we get a classical\nfield theory describing our continuum system, a fluid, at macroscopic scales. In the\nanalogy of continuum space as a condensate, this would be the analogue of GR. As for\nGR, one would discover that there are properties of the system at macroscopic scales\n(e.g. superfluidity) that cannot be fully understood remaining at this level of description,\nor that the above description itself breaks down in some regime. So one would look\nfor a better theory. As in the gravity case, the first possibility would be to simply\n'quantize'the classical theory, turning classical (phase space) variables to operators and\nb\nb(x), \u03c1(x) \u2192 \u03c1b(x), \u03c8(x) \u2192 \u03c8(x).\nso on: v(v) \u2192 v\nThe resulting quantum theory\nis perturbatively non-renormalizable (with quadratic divergences, just like GR), so in\ngeneral would be only an effective field theory. However, the resulting quantum theory\nb become relevant, the\nis not so interesting, because before quantum fluctuations of \u03c1b or v\nwhole hydrodynamic approximation breaks down, and the microscopic atomic structure\nof the fluid becomes relevant. In this case, we also know what is the general form of the\ncorrect microscopic theory for the quantum atoms (the theory of everything):\n\u0013\n\u0012 2\nZ\n\u03ba\u0304 2\n4\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2020\nLmicro = d x \u03a8 \u2202t \u03a8 \u2212 \u03a8\u2202t \u03a8 + \u03a8 (x) \u2212 \u2207 \u2212 \u03bc \u03a8(x)\n2\nZ\nZ\n1\n+\ndtd3 x d3 y \u03a8\u2020 (x)\u03a8\u2020 (y)U(x \u2212 y)\u03a8(y)\u03a8(x),\n(0.4)\n2\nIt is a continuum field theory for the fields whose quanta are the atoms constituting,\nin the appropriate condensed phase, the quantum superfluid, with a quartic potential\nrepresenting the pairwise atomic interaction.\n15\n\n\fNow let's consider the opposite type of problem: assuming we had been given the\nabove correct, quantum description of the atomic system at the most fundamental level,\nhow would we go about extracting the correct behaviour at macroscopic scales? would\nthis be in terms of continuous or discrete entities in its most useful formulation? and\nhow would one derive the hydrodynamic description? Well, this system is reasonably\nwell understood (despite continuous surprises and interesting facets, so we know what to\ndo. First of all, we know that the full thermodynamic limit of the system, in which all of\nits infinite, interacting degrees of freedom play a role, will be characterized, in general,\nby a variety of different phases, depending on the temperature, pressure, and other\nmacroscopic parameters, and on (some of) the properties of microscopic building blocks.\nWe also have the right powerful tools to analyze these phases and the phase transitions,\ni.e. statistical field theory. We know that an hydrodynamic approximation will be valid\nin one of these phases. We also know, by a variety of experimental inputs, theoretical\nassumptions and simplified models, general symmetry considerations etc, that in one of\nthese phases, in fact, the atoms will condense and give rise to a collective behaviour\ncharacterized by a small number of collective hydrodynamic variables. We start by\napproximating microscopic dynamics with a simpler one capturing the key properties:\nb=\nH\n\nZ\n\n\u0013\n\u0012 2 2\n\u03ba b\u2217 b\n~ \u2207\nb\nd3 x.\n+ \u03a8 (x)\u03a8(x) \u03a8(x)\n\u03a8 (x) \u2212\n2m\n2\nb\u2217\n\n(0.5)\n\nb | F.S.i = 0 to a non-trivial vacuum state,\nThen, we move away from Fock vacuum \u03a8\nb\ndescribing the condensate state such that \u03a8(x)|G.S.i\n\u2248 \u03c8(x)|G.S.i, so that \u03c8 is our\norder parameter characterizing the new vacuum (phase) of the system. For example, a\nstate with this property is a (2nd quantized) coherent state:\n|zi i = e\u2212|z|\n\n2 /2\n\nexp(zib\na\u2020i )|F.S.i .\n\n(0.6)\n\nThen, one assumes that the system is in a macroscopic configuration close to | G.S.i\nand applies a mean field approximation:\nb\n\u03a8(x)\n\u2248 \u03c8(x)I + \u03c7\nb(x),\n\n(0.7)\n\nwith \u03c8(x) the condensate wavefunction, and \u03c7\nb deviations from the mean field \u03c8. Finally,\nb\nthe microscopic equations for \u03a8 give then rise to the effective equations for the order\nparameter \u03c8, which are the GP hydrodynamic equations.\nFor more technical details on the group field theory formalism, and its relation with\nother quantum gravity approaches, we refer instead to the literature cited [25, 30, 26, 11].\n\n16\n\n\fReferences\n[1] http://en.wikipedia.org/ \"Chewbacca defense\"\n[2] S.
