INTRODUCTION\n\nStar formation in galaxies peaks at redshifts z \u223c 2\n(Reddy et al. 2005; Conselice et al. 2011), with an overall\ndecline in the global star formation rate density towards\nlater cosmic times (Lilly et al. 1996). Galaxies during\nthe critical redshift range of 1<z<3 are actively converting gas into stars and at least to some extent, building\nup central supermassive black holes (Reddy et al. 2008;\nSomerville 2009). Morphologically, these galaxies are already well underway with assuming the familiar shapes\nof the Hubble sequence (Kriek et al. 2009). Given the\n1 Based, in part, on data obtained with the W. M. Keck Observatory, which is operated as a scientific partnership among\nthe California Institute of Technology, the University of California, and NASA, and was made possible by the generous financial\nsupport of the W.

Properties of these ELGs are determined typically\nfrom ratios of strong rest-frame optical emission lines.\nThe values for the line ratios are persistently high compared to the standard excitation sequence for HII regions\n(Erb et al. 2006; Straughn et al. 2009; P\u00e9rez-Montero\net al. 2009; Xia et al. 2011; Trump et al. 2011). In\nturn the elevated line ratios are generally accompanied by\nhigher ionization parameters and electron densities, indicating that physical conditions may be different from\nthe local universe (Liu et al. 2008; Brinchmann et al.\n2008; Lehnert et al. 2009; Richard et al. 2011). Spatiallyresolved observations can assist with the search for an explanation of these consistently high nebular line ratios.\nIn one case of a field galaxy at z = 1.6 HDF-BMZ1299,\nintegral field unit observations have revealed line ratios\nin the innermost \u223c1.5 kpc that are best-fit by an AGN.\nThis measurement would not have been achievable in the\nspectrum integrated over the whole object (Wright et al.\n2010). Similarly, a Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Wide\nField Camera 3 (WFC3) grism study of ELGs from CANDELS (Grogin et al. 2011; Koekemoer et al. 2011) data\nin GOODS-S reveal the likelihood of weak AGN activity\nin z\u223c2 low mass, low metallicity galaxies (Trump et al.\n2011).\nIt is feasible to use low resolution grism spectroscopy\nwith HST ACS to study ELGs and also galaxies with\nstrong breaks (bulges, Lyman-break galaxies). This approach has been used extensively by the Grism Advanced\nCamera Program for Extragalactic Science (GRAPES)\n\n\f2\n\nFrye et al.\n\nand Probing Evolution and Reionization Spectroscopically (PEARS) Treasury teams (PI: Malhotra). For example, Hathi et al. (2009) studied the stellar populations\nof late-type galaxies at z\u223c1 in the Hubble Ultra Deep\nField (HUDF) using low resolution grism spectroscopy.\nThey identified the bulges in a sample of 34 galaxies by a\ncombination of their prominent 4000 \u00c5 break and visual\nmorphologies. They measured stellar ages in the bulges\nthat are similar to stellar ages in the inner disks and used\nthis information to constrain galaxy formation mechanisms. Ferreras et al. (2009) measured galaxy properties\nfor a sample of 228 galaxies at z\u223c1 selected by morphology and HST ACS grism spectroscopy to be earlytypes. They modeled the star formation histories and\nfound the galaxy formation epoch to correlate strongly\nwith stellar mass in massive early-type galaxies. Xia\net al. (2011) reported on a comparison of 76 ELGs in\nChandra Deep Field South (CDFS) acquired with both\nthe ACS grism and ground-based spectrographs covering similar wavelengths. They compared the grism redshift estimates for a typical case of a single emission\nline plus broad-band photometry with the higher resolution ground-based spectroscopy and successfully recovered the original grism redshift estimates. In yet a\ndifferent use of the ACS grism, Nilsson et al. (2011) undertook a study of Lyman-break galaxies (LBGs) at z\u223c1\ndetected in the UV by GALEX. They used grism spectra covering the 4000 \u00c5 break to measure more accurate\npositions of this break than could be achieved by the\nbroad-band colors alone, which they then used to inform\nthe SED models. The measurements yielded physical\ncharacteristics of their low-redshift sample of LBGs that\nwere similar to LBG properties at higher redshifts.\nMore recently, grism spectroscopy using WFC3 on\nHST Early Release Science program (Windhorst et al.\n2011) has yielded the discovery of 48 ELGs to a limiting\nmagnitude of m=25.5 (AB). They acquired one field observed with the G102 and G140 grisms, each at a 2-orbit\ndepth (Straughn et al. 2011). Specific star formation\nrates (sSFR) were measured based on the SED fits that\nwere low for the highest mass galaxies and that evolved\nwith redshift, in general agreement with galaxy downsizing. (Feulner et al. 2005; Bauer et al. 2005; Elbaz et al.\n2007; Rodighiero et al. 2010; Damen et al. 2009; Zheng\net al. 2007).\nThe introduction of gravitational lensing to grism analyses is useful because it boosts the brightnesses and sizes\nof all objects in the background, allowing for the study\nof individual sources of line emission at higher signal-tonoise and higher spatial resolution. For the case of an\nemission line on top of stellar continuum in particular,\nthe effect of field dilution is to smear out the continuum\nflux over more pixels. At the same time the compact\nstar forming regions or galactic nuclei are also magnified\nbut effectively remain unresolved. Thus the extended\ncontinuum is diluted with respect to the emission lines,\nand the detection threshold is lowered to include weaker\nemission line systems. Assisted by the lensing effect, the\nfirst metallicities at intermediate redshift are being measured directly (Yuan & Kewley 2009; Rigby et al. 2011).\nAlso spatially-resolved spectroscopy is achieved, enabling\nmeasurements of star formation properties across the\ndisk (Jones et al. 2010; Hainline et al. 2009; Frye et al.\n\n2007).\nThe choice of a large, cluster-sized lens offers magnification of all galaxies in the background over fields of\n\u223c2-3 arcmin in radius. Abell 1689 (z = 0.187, measured\nby Frye et al. 2007) with its large tangential critical\ncurve of 5000 is one of the most massive and well-studied\nclusters (Broadhurst et al. 2005; Limousin et al. 2007;\nCoe et al. 2010). The galaxies situated behind massive\nclusters have notoriously low surface brightnesses, and as\nsuch a space-based platform like HST is necessary for undertaking detailed and spatially-resolved studies of ELGs\nwith fields of view larger than can be achieved with integral field unit spectroscopy from the ground. HST has\nalready proved highly successful at identifying ELGs in\na survey mode at intermediate redshifts (Xu et al. 2007;\nStraughn et al. 2008, 2009, 2011; Trump et al. 2011), and\nat high redshifts (Malhotra et al. 2005; Rhoads et al.\n2009). In addition to the wide field of view, spatiallyresolved spectroscopy is achieved with a resolution equal\nto our minimum aperture extraction width five rows or\n0.25,00 and is acquired in the absence of competing strong\natmospheric skylines.\nHere we present a new census of ELGs in the field of\nthe lensing cluster A1689 with the G800L grism on Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) on HST. This is the\nfirst space-based slitless emission line survey centered on\na massive lensing cluster. One new ELG at z \u2248 0.79\nis a star forming galaxy which we designate by the paper reference Frye et al. 2012 object 1, which shortens to\n'F12 ELG1.' This giant arc with \u223c 800 extent is rare for\nshowing continuous line emitting region in several features over half its optical extent. We have taken both\nspace- and ground-based spatially-resolved spectroscopy\nof this one bright ELG with a total magnitude integrated\nover the galaxy image of i775 = 20.56 \u00b1 0.01. This object is suitable for exploring the variations in physical\nproperties across the galaxy disk.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In \u00a72 we present\nour imaging and spectroscopic sample and data reduction techniques. In \u00a73 we give results relating to ELGs\nin the cluster. In \u00a74 we report results for new giant arc\nF12 ELG1. In \u00a75 we use a lens model to construct a\n1d magnification profile, compute individual magnifications for galaxies of interest, and to generate a source\nplane image for F12 ELG1. In \u00a76 we discuss other field\ngalaxies of interest, including another new sample ELG\nwith closely spaced sources of line emission which we call\n'F12 ELG2.' The conclusions appear in \u00a77. We assume\na cosmology with H0 = 70 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 , \u03a9m,0 = 0.3,\n\u03a9\u039b,0 = 0.7.\n2. OBSERVATIONS & REDUCTIONS\n2.1. ACS Grism Data\nThe central portion of A1689 is observed with the\nG800L grism with ACS on HST along with the broad\nband (F475W, F625W, F775W, and F850LP) exposures\npresented in Broadhurst et al. (2005). A single pointing\nis used at one position angle in a 7.1 ks exposure (3 orbits). The resulting dispersed image covers a wavelength\nrange of 5700 - 9800 \u00c5 at a resolution of R \u223c 90. The\nanalysis of these images is performed using software discussed in detail by Meurer et al. (2007, hereafter M07).\nM07 present G800L grism observation of a well-studied\n\n\fSpatially-resolved Spectroscopy at z=0.7895\nunlensed field, the Hubble Deep Field North (HDF-N), to\na similar depth as our observations. They reduce and analyze this dataset in two different ways: Method A: aXe\nselection and reduction (K\u00fcmmel et al. 2009), which is\nsimilar to the GRAPES team pipeline, and Method B:\n'blind' emission line source detection. Method A yields\na similar set of sources as Method B, with the latter additionally yielding >50% more sources and more cases\nof multiple emission line sources (i.e. star forming regions) per object. A salient feature of Method B is its\nemphasis on finding emission lines in the 2d dispersed\nframes. This approach enables lone emission lines with\nweak galaxy continuum flux to be detected against the\nhigh background that is characteristic of grism images.\nFor our aims to do spatially-resolved spectroscopy and\nto maximize the number of emission line sources, we perform the reductions using Method B. The primary steps\nof the reduction algorithm are discussed below.\nThe initial data reduction is performed with the Space\nTelescope Science Institute (STScI) ACS CCD reduction\npipeline CALACS (Hack 1999), from which we use the\ncosmic ray rejected \"CRJ\" G800L images along with the\nindividual flatfielded \"FLT\" broad band images (F475W,\nF625W, F775W, and F850LP). Since CALACS does\nnot flatfield G800L exposures we apply our own corrections for pixel-to-pixel variations using a standard\nF814W flat from the STScI archive. To remove small\ndithers between exposures and to correct for geometric distortion we employ the ACS team pipeline Apsis\n(Blakeslee et al. 2003). These initial reduction steps produce geometrically-corrected and aligned grism images,\nwhich are processed further as described below. Similarly, Apsis is used to align and process the set of broadband images; the weighted sum of these is what we designate as the \"direct\" image.\nGalaxies with strong emission lines (ELs) should be\nthe easiest sources to identify in slitless images like our\nG800L data. Method B of M07 requires no prior knowledge of the location of the emitting source, although\nthe direct image is needed to find the precise position\nof the emission. Moving forward from the initial reductions discussed above, we next subtract off a 13x3 median\nsmoothed version of the dispersed image, revealing the\nemission line(s). We also subtract off a smoothed version of the direct image from itself. The result of this\nhigh-pass filter is to remove slowly-varying background\nlevels, including galaxy continuum, starlight from galaxy\nneighbors and other sources. As detailed in M07 we have\ndetermined a geometric distortion solution relating positions in the direct image to the corresponding positions of the zeroth order in the grism image. This solution along with the measured flux scaling between direct\nand zeroth order images is used to mask out all significant flux from zeroth order images in the grism frame.\nSExtractor (Bertin & Arnouts 1996) is used to find the\nemission line sources in this masked and filtered grism\nframe. A five row segment of both of the the filtered\ndispersed and direct image are extracted, collapsed to\n1D spectra and cross-correlated. The peak in the cross\ncorrelation gives the location of the emitting source and\nan estimated line wavelength. The aXe package is then\nused to extract a 1D spectrum from the dispersed image\n(prior to any filtering) using the location we found as\nthe adopted source position.

Figure 2 shows\n1D spectra for other representative ELGs in our sample.\nSome line pairs can be distinguished which assist with\nline identifications. Notably, nebular lines [OIII] and H\u03b2\nare marginally resolved in the new galaxy ELG 5158, and\nthe close line pair H\u03b1 and [SII] can both be identified in\nthe new galaxy ELG 4298.\nWe refer to an emission feature in the dispersed image as an EL (typically H\u03b1, H\u03b2, [OIII] or [OII]). The\ncorresponding position in the direct image is called an\nemission line source (ELS). An ELS is typically an HII\nregion or galaxy nucleus, and in some cases there is more\nthan one EL per ELS (e.g. [OII] and [OIII]). The galaxy\ncontaining the ELS(s) is an emission line galaxy (ELG).\nIf the galaxy is spatially resolved, there may be multiple ELSs per ELG. We identify a total of 43 galaxies\n(ELGs), 52 ELSs and 66 ELs. Somewhat surprisingly,\nthree-fourths of the ELGs are new in this well-studied\ncluster field. The spectroscopic results appear in Table 1. We identify nine ELGs in the cluster, 30 ELGs\nin the background, and five ELGs in the foreground. As\nthe number of ELSs is larger than the number of ELGs,\nsome ELGs have multiple H II regions spatially-resolved\nby the grism. In Table 2 we separate out the ELGs with\ntwo or more ELSs.

Details concerning these results\nappear in Table 1.\n\nand emission line properties sorted by species are given\nin the Appendix.\n2.2. Imaging and Additional Spectroscopy\n\nExtensive ancillary data exist to support the grism observations. Images of the central portion of A1689 were\ntaken in several bands, as follows: U (DuPont Telescope,\nLas Campanas), B (NOT, La Palma), V (Keck II LRIS),\nI (Keck II LRIS), g475 r625 i775 and z850 (HST ACS), and\nP3.6 and P4.5 (Spitzer IRAC). Spectroscopy of hundreds\nof arclets have been acquired at several large groundbased observatories. The existing photometry and spectroscopy are discussed in detail elsewhere (Broadhurst\net al. 2005; Frye et al. 2002, 2007, 2008).\nAdditional spectroscopy was obtained for F12 ELG1\nat z=0.79 in 2010 May with the DEep Imaging MultiObject Spectrograph (DEIMOS) on Keck II (Faber et al.\n2003). The observations were made through a 1 arcsec\nslit width with the 1200 line mm\u22121 grating blazed at\n10.16\u25e6 and set to a central wavelength of 7800 \u00c5. A combination of 12 slitlets were placed together to construct\nthe longslit mask \"Long1.0B.\" Two 300 s exposures were\ntaken during dusk twilight. The seeing was 0.5-0.600\nFWHM. Long1.0B provided a resolution of R=5870 measured from an isolated night sky line at 7571.75 \u00c5. Observations were also acquired on the Magellan Telescope\nI (Walter Baade) in 2009 March and 2010 March on\nthe Inamori Magellan Areal Camera and Spectrograph\n\n0\n0.10\n\n0.15\n\n0.20\nRedshift\n\n0.25\n\n0.30\n\nFig. 3.- Histogram of HAEs from this sample (purple positiveslope hashed region), compared to that of all published spectroscopic redshifts in A1689 (green negative-slope hashed region).\nThere is an extended tail towards higher redshifts which may be\nindicate substructure and/or cluster infall. The HAEs that satisfy\nthe redshift criteria for cluster membership are enclosed by the gray\nfilled region. The mean redshift of all known cluster members is\ngiven by the solid line and the mean redshift of our sample cluster\nmembers is given by the dashed line.\n\n(IMACS). One multislit mask was used with 35 targets\nusing the 600 lines mm\u22121 grism at a blaze angle of 14.67\n\u00c5 and a central wavelength of 8410 \u00c5 as a part of a different program (PIs Malhotra and Rhoads). The grism\nprovided a resolution of R = 2300. Eight 1800 s exposures were taken in a single position.\n3. THE CLUSTER\n\nWe identify 8 ELSs that are H\u03b1 emitters (HAEs) in\nthe redshift range 0.159<z<0.206, which is the 3\u03c3 velocity dispersion redshift criteria established by Balogh\net al. (2002). There are three H\u03b1 emitting sources in\nthe foreground of A1689, and ten H\u03b1 emitting sources\nwith z>0.206. There is a high velocity tail in the redshift range 0.207<z<0.215 that includes five ELSs that\nare HAEs (Fig. 3). Our sample is distinguished from the\nlarger ground-based H\u03b1 galaxy survey of Balogh et al.\n(2002) primarily by our fainter flux limit of iAB = 27.3.\nSix of the galaxies that are H\u03b1 emitters with redshifts\n0.159<z<0.215 are new to the literature: ELG 6621a\n(serendipitous discovery, see Appendix), ELG 11226,\nELG 4298/4251 (ELS 4298 and ELS 4251), ELG 2494,\nELG 10412, ELG 1507.\nFigure 4 shows the locations of our sample cluster\nmembers (green stars) and of H\u03b1 emitters drawn from\nthe literature (purple diamonds). The [OII], [OIII] and\nBalmer line emitters from the large sample of Duc et al.\n(2002) appear as large open squares. The positions\nof other cluster members are also marked (small open\nsquares), drawn largely from the literature as compiled\nin Frye et al. (2007, their Appendix). The large tilted\nrectangle marks the ACS field of view and the black circle shows the position of the canonical 50 arcsec Einstein\nring for A1689. The HAEs presented in this paper have\nmeasured line fluxes of \u221214.82 < log f < \u221216.61. The\nsymbols are organized by total flux, with small and large\nsymbols identifying log(fH\u03b1 ) \u2265 \u221216.0.

The\nspatially-resolved spectroscopy corresponds to the three sources of\nline emission along the long axis of this galaxy, ELS 20002 ('A'),\nELS 10638 ('B'), and ELS 10640 ('C'). Components B and C are\n0.2700 apart, corresponding to an intrinsic separation of only 0.5\nkpc. The flux of [OIII] relative to H\u03b2 is highest in the center, and\nfrom follow-up spectroscopy we find a region near the center to\nbe best-fit by an AGN (See \u00a76.1 and Fig. 9). The shift in the\nline peaks between components A, B, and C is a result of large\nuncertainties in the zero-point of the wavelength solution. We detect emission in a second galaxy near in projection to F12 ELG1,\nlabeled as ELS 2630 at z = 0.335.\nFig. 4.- Map of HAEs in A1689 from our census (green\nstars) and from the sample of Balogh et al. (2002) (purple diamonds). Our HAEs are further organized by flux, with small\nand large symbols representing objects with log(fH\u03b1 )<\u221216.0 and\nlog(fH\u03b1 )\u2265\u221216.0 respectively. The HAEs are well-distributed azimuthally, and appear to be underpopulated at smaller clustercentric radii. The positions of cluster members with absorption\nredshifts from Duc et al. (2002), and the few that could be found\nin the literature, are indicated by the open-squares and concentricsquares, respectively. The canonical Einstein ring is indicated by\nthe large black circle, with cluster center at 'X.'\n\nof 0.017 <SFR < 1.1M yr\u22121 .\nThe positions of the ELGs cover the far-field reasonably well. Of the 30 H\u03b1 emitters comprising this sample plus those drawn from the literature, only one is located close in to the cluster center. This is a new ELG\npresented in this paper, ELG 4298/4251, which with\ni775 = 21.74 \u00b1 0.01 is not reported in the large H\u03b1 survey\nof Balogh et al. (2002) as it is fainter than their I-band\nmagnitude-limit of 19.3. The preferential placement of\nH\u03b1 emitters in the cluster outskirts appears to satisfy\nthe general trend of increasing star fraction as density\ndecreases, and is biased as a result of confusion from a\nhigh source density in the cluster interior and small number statistics. It is interesting to note that there is an\nexcess of galaxies detected at 100 \u03bcm with Herschel that\nis distributed as a swath running NE-SW across their\nfield (Haines et al. 2010). Evidence of filamentary structure is not seen in our galaxy census which is less than\none-tenth the field size of their sample.\n4. F12 ELG1: THE GIANT ARC AT Z=0.7895\n4.1. Galaxy Properties Measured from the HST Grism\n\nThe image and spatially-resolved G800L spectra of\nF12 ELG1 with a visual extent of > 8 arcsec and a magnification provided by the cluster of a factor of 4.5 appear\nin Figure 5. This is one of a handful of the brightest star\nforming galaxies at z \u223c 1 (MB =\u221221.3), allowing for a\nstudy of one ELG in detail at intermediate redshift. The\nHST grism spectroscopy shows three separate emission\nline sources (ELSs) as ELS 20002 ('A'), ELS 10638 ('B'),\nand ELS 10640 ('C'). Each ELS has at least two emission\n\nlines: [OII] \u03bb\u03bb3726, 3729 and [OIII] \u03bb\u03bb4959, 5007, with\nthe central knot 'B' also showing H\u03b2 line emission. The\nline fluxes and rest equivalent widths are given in Table 1. A fit to the line centroids of the emission features\nin Component A yields a redshift of z=0.790, confirming\nthe redshift in Duc et al. (2002). Knots A and B have a\nseparation at the source of 1.5 kpc, while knots B and C\nare separated by only 0.5 kpc. There appear to be significant redshift differences between knots A, B, and C.\nThese are likely to be owing to misidentification of the\nprecise x position of the ELSs, which will translate into\na wavelength error.\n4.2. Galaxy Properties Measured from Ground-based\n\nSpectroscopy\nIn our Keck and Magellan spectra of F12 ELG1 we\nsee line emission from star forming regions across a continuous 4.00 From the 1D spectroscopy of this extended\nline emission we recover all the emission features of the\nHST grism spectrum, and detect as well additional emission lines. We identify: [O II]\u03bb3726, [O II]\u03bb3729, [O\nIII]\u03bb4959, [O III]\u03bb5007, H\u03b2 and H\u03b3, with H\u03b4, H\u000f, H8,\nand [Ne III]\u03bb3869, and weak [C III]/[C IV]\u03bb4650 (in the\nMagellan spectrum). While the results are similar for\nour two ground-based datasets, we will focus primarily\non the Keck spectrum herein with its higher spectral resolution and flux calibration taken with a standard star\nat the time of the observations,. The line fluxes for the\nstrong emission lines for the Keck spectroscopy appear\nin Table 3.\nA Gaussian fit to [OII] and [OIII] in our Keck spectrum\nyields a new systemic redshift of z=0.7895. The line\nwidth is estimated from the fit to the [OIII] \u03bb5007 line,\nand is found to be \u2206v = 500 km s\u22121 after subtraction\nof the instrumental resolution. This is the line width\nset for all other emission features. To account for the\nslightly asymmetric line profile of the [OIII] \u03bb5007 line\nowing to an adjacent sky line, the flux value is taken\nfrom the Gaussian fit rather than from the data values.\nThe [OIII] \u03bb4959 line also suffers from its unfortunate\n\n\f6\n\nFrye et al.\n\n15\n\nH\u03b2\n\nF\u03bb (1017 ergs s\u22121 cm\u22122 \u00c5\u22121)\n\n1\n0\nH\u03b3\n\n1\n0\nH\u03b4\n\n1\n0\nH\u03b5\n\n1\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n\n0\n\n3720\n\nH8\n\n1\n0\n\u2212700\n\n\u2212350\n\n0\n\n350\n\nVelocity km s\u22121\n\n700\n\nFig. 6.- Stackplot of the Balmer family of emission lines\nfor F12 ELG1, as labelled. Most notable is the rare detection\nof Balmer transmission lines continuously in emission from H\u03b2\nthrough H8, indicating a young starburst event. The continuum\nfit plus uncertainties are given by the red solid plus red dashed\nlines. The velocity range of the line (in blue) corresponds to \u2212250\nkm s\u22121 <v<+250 km s\u22121 with reference to the systemic redshift\nof z = 0.7895. These data are from our Magellan follow-up spectroscopy and the units are in normalized counts. All spectra have\nbeen corrected for extinction by dust.\n\nplacement relative to a skyline. In this case the well\ndefined ratio of [OIII] \u03bb5007 to [OIII] \u03bb4959 of 3:1 is\nused for any calculations involving the sum of the fluxes\nor equivalent widths of these two lines. For all other\nline features, the values are measured directly from the\ndata. The Balmer transition lines H\u03b2 through H8 are\nshown in Figure 6. The velocity range over our 500 km\ns\u22121 measurement width is shown in blue and varies from\n\u2212250 km s\u22121 < v < +250 km s\u22121 with reference to\nthe systemic redshift of z =0.7895. This large family of\nBalmer features all in emission is rare for an extragalactic\nsource and signals the early stages of a major starburst.\nOur Keck spectrum has at best only a slight continuum break at rest-frame 4000\u00c5. Balogh et al. (1999)\ndefine this break Dn (4000) as the ratio of the average flux density in the wavelength band 4000-4100\u00c5 to\nthe 3850-3950 \u00c5 band. We measure a break index of\nDn (4000) = 0.96 \u2212 1.0 after first masking out the strong\n[Ne III]\u03bb3869 and H8 emission lines. This near lack of a\ncontinuum depression indicates a dominant population\nof hot young stars. The population synthesis models\nof Bruzual & Charlot (2003, hereafter BC03) provide a\nvalue of Dn (4000) for each spectral energy distribution\n(SED; see \u00a74.3 for a description of our model). For a reasonable subset of models over four metallicities (0.2Z ,\n0.4Z , Z , and 2.5Z ) and a range of star formation\nhistories, we have set an initial constraint on the age of\n\n3725\n3730\nRest Wavelength (\u00c5)\n\n3735\n\nFig. 7.- Rest-frame resolved [OII] \u03bb\u03bb3726,3729 emission lines\nfrom F12 ELG1, with Gaussian fits to the features overlaid. The\nratio of the relative strengths of the two lines allow the calculation\nof the electron density Ne = 980 \u2212 1280 cm\u22123 . These data are\nfrom our Keck DEIMOS follow-up spectroscopy.\n\nthe dominant stellar population of the galaxy to a range\nof 6 Myrs 6 t 6 100 Myrs. Note that any contribution\nfrom AGN continuum light would operate to raise the\nvalue for Dn (4000), and hence lead to an underestimate\nin the age of the galaxy (Kauffmann et al. 2003). We\ninfer from spatially-resolved analysis that this object is\nmost likely dominated by star formation but also shows\nevidence of a harder ionizing source (see \u00a76).\nThe [OII]\u03bb\u03bb3726, 3729 doublet is spectrally-resolved\nin our Keck DEIMOS data, and this is useful as these\nare density sensitive lines (Fig. 7). The intensity ratio\nis measured to be 1.44, which for a typical temperature\nof T = 10,000-20,000 K equates to Ne = 980 \u2212 1280\ncm\u22123 . This is a factor of \u223c3 higher than the star forming galaxies in the Kobulnicky & Kewley (2004) sample\nwith 0.3<z<1.0, and is consistent with ELG samples at\nz\u223c2 (Lehnert et al. 2009; Hainline et al. 2009). These,\nand all other fluxes in this paper are corrected for underlying stellar absorption, extinction by dust, and cluster\nmagnification as described in \u00a74.3 and \u00a75.\n4.3. The SED, Underlying Stellar Absorption, and\n\nReddening\nThe hydrogen Balmer features consist of both a nebular emission and a stellar absorption term. The emission\nlines tend to weaken towards higher level transitions owing to the sum of a rapidly decreasing nebular emission\nline strength with decreasing wavelength and an equivalent width of the stellar absorption component that at\nbest increases only modestly with wavelength. To make\na correction for the underlying stellar absorption we compute an intrinsic SED model template and then subtract\nit from the galaxy spectrum in a manner similar to that\nof Tremonti et al. (2004). We note that as our object is\nrare for showing H\u03b2 through H8 all in emission, the underlying stellar absorption is not expected to be a major\ncontaminant.\n\n\fSpatially-resolved Spectroscopy at z=0.7895\nOur optical through infrared photometry is used to\nconstruct the matching SED model. We delens the photometry using a magnification factor of 4.5. The observed (unlensed) photometry of F12 ELG1 is as follows: U =21.05\u00b10.16, B=21.22\u00b10.17, V =21.08\u00b10.15,\ng 0 = 21.06\u00b10.08, r0 = 20.87\u00b10.01, i0 = 20.56\u00b10.01, z 0 =\n20.44\u00b10.01, P3.6 =20.11\u00b10.07 and P4.5 = 20.46\u00b140.08.\nOur measurements of the Balmer decrement allow a\nbracketed range of model stellar ages 6<t<100Myr (see\n\u00a74.2). This constraint is in keeping with our detection of\nhigher level Balmer emission lines, as population synthesis models for star-forming galaxies predict for these features an increase with evolution up to 500 Myr (Gonz\u00e1lez\nDelgado et al. 1999). Our model fitting approach allows\nfor a range of metallicities and assumes a single starburst model with a range of decay rates \u03c4 and a star\nformation rate that depends exponentially on \u03c4 as follows: SF R(t)\u221dexp(t/\u03c4 ). A summary of our parameter\nranges are as follows:\n\u2022 \u03c4 = 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.5, 1 and 5 Gyr\n\u2022 t = 6 - 100 Myr\n\u2022 Z = 0.2Z , 0.4Z , 1Z , 2.5Z\nFor each fixed \u03c4 , t, and Z, two parameters are fit to\nthe data: color excess E(B \u2212 V ), and stellar mass M\u2217 .\nA suite of models are constructed over the allowable parameter space, and each model is corrected for dust extinction. We compute synthetic photometry for comparison with the observed photometry until the lowest value\nof reduced \u03c72 is obtained, as is described in detail in\nFrye et al. (2008). Our best fit model estimate yields\nE(B \u2212 V ) = 0.45 and M\u2217 = 2 \u00d7 109 M for a young stellar age of t = 8 Myrs, Z = 0.4Z and \u03c4 = 5 Gyr. After\nredshifting and binning to the correct spectral resolution,\nwe measure a correction in rest-frame equivalent width\nof W = 1.5\u00c5 for the H\u03b2 line. All Balmer emission lines\ninclude this correction for underlying stellar absorption.\nOur measured emission line rest equivalent widths are\ntoo low to affect the SED fits, in contrast to the large\nequivalent widths found in Atek et al. (2011). Note although t is less than the estimated galaxy crossing time\nby a factor of \u223c2, we find the BC03 models to provide an\nadequate fit to the data for our purposes of determining\nestimates for stellar absorption.\nThe attenuation of the intrinsic light due to dust is\ncalculated from a standard curve, which for a starbursting galaxy is given in Calzetti et al. (2000), their Eq. 4.\nDust extinction is calculated using the Balmer decrement\nmethod, whereby a pair of emission lines with a welldefined intrinsic ratio from atomic theory such as Balmer\nlines is compared with the data. We use H\u03b2 and H\u03b3 from\nour Keck dataset, and attribute any deviation from the\nintrinsic value to dust. After correcting for the underlying stellar absorption, we measure f (H\u03b3)/f (H\u03b2) =\n0.321. For an intrinsic ratio of f (H\u03b3)/f (H\u03b2) = 0.469\ngiven by Osterbrock (1989), we compute E(B \u2212 V )gas \u2248\n0.78. This value is different from the color excess measured by SED fitting of E(B \u2212 V ) = 0.45. Some of this\ndiscrepancy is owing to incomplete areal coverage of the\ngalaxy image. We adopt the more general value measured from the SED modeling for this study.\n\n7\n\n4.4. Spectral Classification\nThe spectral classification of ELGs at low redshift can\nbe determined from emission line diagnostic diagrams\nsuch as the classical Baldwin, Phillips & Terlevich (BPT)\ndiagram (Baldwin et al. 1981). The BPT diagram is\nbased in part on H\u03b1 and [N II] lines which are redshifted\nout of the optical passband for z > 0.4. Classification\nsystems based on bluer emission lines are also well developed (Lamareille et al. 2004, 2009; P\u00e9rez-Montero et al.\n2009; Lamareille 2010; Rola et al. 1997; Marocco et al.\n2011). Marocco et al. (2011) revise the blue emission line\nscheme of Lamareille (2010). Their samples are derived\nfrom the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and do not\ninclude a correction for dust extinction.\nWe classify F12 ELG1 for our ACS grism (G800L)\ndataset for which we have complete coverage of the emitting line region. We correct all fluxes for underlying stellar absorption and dust extinction and sum up the flux\nover all three ELSs. Under the Marocco et al. (2011)\nscheme, which involves the line ratios f ([OIII])/f ([H\u03b2])\nand f ([OII])/f ([H\u03b2]), F12 ELG1 is situated in the intermediate region that includes both star-forming galaxies\n(SFGs) and Seyfert 2 objects. In a different classification\nscheme, P\u00e9rez-Montero et al. (2009) use also the VVDS\nsamples but instead consider the ratios of f ([OII])/f (H\u03b2)\nand f ([Ne III])/f (H\u03b2) after accounting for dust extinction. With this diagnostic set, F12 ELG1 is placed in a\nregion that includes SFGs and the uncertainty domain\nbetween SFGs and AGNs.\nThe detection of additional spectral features similarly\nsuggests that F12 ELG1 is in a position intermediate\nbetween star forming and AGN source types. We detect [CIII]/[CIV]\u03bb4650 commonly seen in AGN and measure a flux ratio of [NeIII]/H\u03b2\u2248 0.6, a value consistent\nwith excitation by a hard ionizing source (Osterbrock\n1989). At the same time we fail to detect [NeV]\u03bb3426\nand [HeII\u03bb4686], two emission lines typically associated\nwith AGN, although the signal-to-noise is poor at the\nexpected position of [NeV]\u03bb3426 owing to its placement\non top of a strong skyline. Note the AGN diagnostic\nline [NeV]\u03bb3346 is blueward of our passband. As for the\ncommon nebular lines, the flux ratio f ([OIII])/f (H\u03b2) is\nlow in the center, a trend that runs contrary to the expected behavior of a central AGN (Fig. 5). Interestingly, the Balmer decrement is at best only marginally\ndetected, which when used as an additional diagnostic\nplaces this object as an SFG for any value of [OII] and\n[NeIII] (Marocco et al. 2011). We conclude that there is\nat least a strong star forming component to F12 ELG1,\nand that the AGN interpretation cannot be ruled out.\nWe will use spatially-resolved spectroscopy to address\nthe possibility that this object supports AGN-like activity in \u00a74.7.\n4.5. Gas-phase Oxygen Abundance\n\nThe gas phase oxygen abundance is estimated from\nthe metallicity sensitive rest-frame optical emission lines.\nThe direct measurement from the [OIII]\u03bb4363 line typically seen in metal-poor galaxies is not detected in any of\nour spectroscopy. The indirect measurement using emission line ratios involving H\u03b1 is redshifted out of our passband. From the available emission lines we can compute\nR23 =(f ([OII]\u03bb3727)+f ([OIII]\u03bb\u03bb4959,5007))/f (H\u03b2) and\n\n\fFrye et al.\n\nO32 =(f ([OIII]\u03bb4959)+f ([OIII]\u03bb5007))/f ([OII]). R23 =\n+0.39\n4.6+2.3\n\u22121.5 , and O32 = 0.96\u22120.28 for the G800L dataset and\nafter first correcting all line fluxes for underlying stellar absorption, reddening and cluster magnification. The\nuncertainties reflect 1\u03c3 errors in the noise and continuum\nplacement.\nThe calculation of gas-phase oxygen abundances from\nR23 is complicated by its double-valued behavior, with\na given value representing either the metal-poor lower\nbranch, the metal-rich upper branch, or a transition at 12\n+ log (O/H) \u2248 8.4. We measure values for several empirical calibrations. Our value for R23 yields an abundance\nof 12 + log (O/H) = 8.1 (lower branch) and 8.9 (upper branch) Kobulnicky & Kewley (2004). For Tremonti\net al. (2004) as adapted from the method of Charlot &\nLonghetti (2001) we obtain 12 + log (O/H) = 8.8 (upper branch). For Zaritsky et al. (1994) we measure 12\n+ log (O/H) = 8.8 (upper branch). Finally, we compute\n12 + log (O/H) = 7.8 (lower branch) and 8.7 (upper\nbranch) for McGaugh (1991) as given by Kobulnicky &\nJohnson (1999). F12 ELG1 is consistent with being on\neither branch.\nOf the available emission features, the secondary indicator [NeIII] can break the metallicity degeneracy (Nagao et al. 2006). We compute f ([NeIII])/f ([OII]) =\n0.05+0.01\n\u22120.07 , which has a best-fit polynomial correspondence value of 12 + log(O/H) = 8.8 \u00b1 0.2. Our value\nis close to the solar value of 12 + log (O/H) = 8.66 (Allende Prieto et al. 2002; Asplund et al. 2004). It also\noverlaps with the range of values obtained from current\nmetallicity history studies at z=1-2 of 12 + log(O/H) =\n8.3 - 9.0 (Lamareille et al. 2006; Liu et al. 2008; Hainline\net al. 2009). In turn, all values are higher than those of\ndirect measurements from strongly-lensed high-z galaxies\n(Yuan & Kewley 2009; Rigby et al. 2011).\n4.6. Star Formation Rate\n\nWe estimate the star formation rate in two ways: (1)\nby extrapolating the intrinsic H\u03b2 line flux into an estimate of the H\u03b1 flux, and (2) from the intrinsic (corrected\nfor reddening and lensing magnification) [OII] line flux.\nAlthough our observations do not cover the most reliable\ntracer of star formation, H\u03b1, one can infer the H\u03b1 line\nflux from the E(B \u2212 V ) value and the intrinsic flux ratio\nbetween H\u03b2 and H\u03b1 (Osterbrock 1989). We estimate the\n+0.53\nintrinsic fluxes for H\u03b1 to be: f (H\u03b1)=1.4\u22120.61\n\u00d7 10\u221215\n\u221216\nergs s\u22121 cm\u22122 and f (H\u03b1)=2.1+0.38\nergs s\u22121\n\u22120.33 \u00d7 10\n\u22122\ncm\nfor the Keck and HST G800L observations, respectively. The SFR can be measured using the relation\nstarting from Kennicutt (1998): SF R(M /yr)=7.9 \u00d7\n2\n10\u221242 f (H\u03b1) \u2217 4\u03c0DL\nergs s\u22121 . For the Keck observations we measure SFR =31+11\nyr\u22121 . For the HST\n\u221213 M\nG800L observations there is insufficient spectral resolution to detect H\u03b2 in every ELS, making our value of SFR\n>\n\u22121\na lower limit. We will adopt the value for\n\u223c 6.5 M yr\nthe SFR from the Keck observations for this study.\nCalibration of the star formation rate using the intrinsic [OII] \u03bb3727 line is more challenging, as it is more\nsensitive to reddening, metallicity and ionization parameter. Kewley et al. (2004) present an algorithm that\ntakes these dependencies into account, especially for high\ngas-phase oxygen abundances which apply to our case\n\n(log (O/H) + 12 > 8.4). Their Equation 14 for SFR\nis based on ionization parameter and gas-phase oxygen\nabundance. Using this equation yields SFR[OII] \u2248 3 M\nyr\u22121 for the G800L grism dataset, a value that is small\ncompared to estimates based on H\u03b2 flux. We will adopt\nthe value for the SFR from the H\u03b2 flux for this study\nas its relation to H\u03b1 is better understood, and plan to\nmeasure SFR directly by H\u03b1 in grism observations with\nVLT SINFONI in an upcoming paper. Finally, we compute sSFR\u2248 20 Gyr\u22121 .\n\n10\n\n#7\n8\n\nArbitrary Flux\n\n8\n\n6\n\nH\u03b2\n\n#6\n#5\n#4\n\n4\n\n#3\n2 #2\n\n#1\n0\n8680\n\n8690\n8700\n8710\nObserved Wavelength (\u00c5)\n\n8720\n\nFig. 8.- Spectra centered on the H\u03b2 emission line are plotted for\neach of the seven slices in our spatially-resolved Keck spectrum of\nF12 ELG1 at z = 0.7895. The colors are matched to the colors in\nFig. 9. The line fits are used to determine the central wavelengths\nand FWHM's. We find a small Doppler shift in the line centroid\nacross the bins.\n\n4.7. Spatial Trends in F12 ELG1\n\nThe image of this giant arc is noticeably bisected into\na broad, line-emitting clump and a long extended tail.\nLine emission is detected only in the clump. We have\nspatially-resolved spectroscopy with sufficient angular\nresolution to subdivide the line emitting clump into seven\ncontiguous bins of 0.600 each, or equivalently 1kpc each\nafter correcting for a magnification factor of 4.5. Each\nbin is assigned a different color. The bins have the following assignments: Bin 1 (purple), Bin 2 (rose), Bin 3\n(lavender), Bin 4 (light green), Bin 5 (dark green), Bin 6\n(olive), and Bin 7 (orange). We extract the seven spectra and compute line fluxes, line centroids and velocity\nwidths for common emission lines. A sample stack plot\ncentered on the position of H\u03b2 in particular is shown in\nFigure 8, and an image of F12 ELG1 with the seven bins\noverlaid appears in the top panel of Figre 9.\n\n\fSpatially-resolved Spectroscopy at z=0.7895\n\nFig. 9.- gri image of F12 ELG1 at z = 0.7895, with trends in\nthe FWHM of a strong emission line and metallicity dependent line\nratios shown along the substructure of this giant arc. Each spatial\nbin covers 0.600 or \u223c1 kpc (intrinsic). The FWHM peaks at Bin\n2, which is taken to be the dynamical center. The metal fraction\npeaks in Bin 3, which is offset from the dynamical center. The\nmetal line ratios in Bin 3 admit the possibility of an AGN. This\nasymmetrical AGN-like behavior may be a result of shocks in the\ndirection of the long extended tail.\n\nThe velocity dispersion \u03c3 is derived from the FWHM\nof the H\u03b2 line and based on the assumption that the line\nwidth is set by the spread of velocities of the line emitting\ngas about the local central mass. The instrumental profile is subtracted off of the FWHM in quadrature, and\nthen \u03c3 is computed as follows: FWHM/2.355*c/\u03bbobs .\nThere should be a peak at the galaxy's center of mass if\nthe object is supported by a central mass pulling on the\nstars. For F12 ELG1 the peak is at Bin 2, making this location the likely location for the galaxy nucleus (Fig. 9).\nThe uncertainties in \u03c3 come from continuum fitting and\nare less than the size of the plotting symbols. It is inter-\n\n9\n\nesting that the H\u03b2 line centroid blueshifts relative to the\nmean value along the galaxy, from \u2206v = +35 \u00b1 5 km s\u22121\nfor bin 1 to \u2206v = \u221213 \u00b1 5 km s\u22121 in bin 7. These results\nare similar to what is also seen across the lensed galaxy\nLens22.3 at z = 1.7 (Yuan & Kewley 2009). From the\nvelocity dispersion one can compute a rough value for the\ndynamical mass of \u223c 2 \u00d7 109 M . This value is consistent\nwith our estimated stellar galaxy mass from SED-fitting.\nWe measure MB = \u221222.2, and in turn obtain an estimate of the mass to light ratio of M/L \u22481. Our low\nmeasured M/L and stellar mass is consistent also with\nour stellar age by SED fitting of t = 8Myr. This is similar to the work of van der Wel et al. (2005) who find a\nlow M/L and low stellar mass at z\u223c1 to be correlated\nwith a young stellar age.\nThe trends of various metallicity-dependent line ratios\nacross the galaxy are also shown in Figure 9. We retain the same bin coloring scheme and apply the same\nmodest correction for stellar absorption and extinction\nto each bin as computed in \u00a74.3. While the peak in the\nFWHM is at Bin 2, there is a temptation to find a peak\nover the metal line ratios at Bin 3, and a drop off to the\nleft-hand-side (Bins 1 and 2). We derive below a number\nof interesting results by a comparison of values in Bin 3\nwith the mean of Bins 1 and 2 (Bins 1-2). By Marocco\net al. (2011) Bin 3 encompasses the composite star forming galaxy (SFG)/Seyfert 2 and Seyfert 2-only regions\nof their f ([OIII]/H\u03b2) vs. f ([OII]/H\u03b2) H II excitation\ndiagram. Meanwhile Bins 1-2 yield a different result,\nand reside entirely in the SFG/Seyfert 2 region. By the\napproach of P\u00e9rez-Montero et al. (2009), which includes\n[NeIII], Bin 3 plus uncertainty region lies in the transition region between SFGs and AGNs while Bins 1-2 plus\nuncertainty region lies entirely inside the SFG region.\nWe conclude that the disky Bins 1-2 are consistent with\nan SFG while Bin 3 exhibits AGN-like behavior. These\nstrong metal line ratios that are driven by a hard ionizing source and are offset by \u223c1kpc from the peak of the\nvelocity dispersion appear to be best explained by shocks\nin the direction of the galaxy tail (Bins 4-7).\nThe values for [OIII]/H\u03b2 are large all across the galaxy,\nand are also higher in Bin 3 compared to Bins 1-2. In Bin\n3 we measure log(f ([OIII])/f (H\u03b2)) = 0.49 \u00b1 0.04. There\nis only a hint of a trend in the behavior of [NeIII]/H\u03b2,\nbut it is worth noting that [NeIII]/H\u03b2 is high in the central three bins, and for Bin 3 in particular the value is\nconsistent with 0.4, a value commonly associated with\nAGN (Osterbrock 1989). It is tempting to say the disky\nBins 4-7 also show a decline from Bin 3, and if so then\nthe various line ratios are not falling off as rapidly as\nin Bins 1-2. We speculate that there is a moderately\nelevated metal fraction in Bins 4-7 that may be a result of increased star formation activity in the direction\nof the galaxy tail, indicating possible harassment in the\ngalaxy's star formation history.\nIf Bins 4-7 indeed lead towards a galaxy tail, then one\ncan ask the question of which are the likely culprits for\npast interactions? F12 ELG1 has neighbors roughly centered in redshift at the systemic redshift of z=0.7895.\nThere are seven galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts of\n0.7625<z<0.8175 distributed over a field in the image\nplane of \u2248 3.5 arcmin on a side, which for a mean magnification of \u223c 4\u00d7 yields a physical size in the source\nplane of 0.8 Mpc. This structure or filament may con-\n\n\f10\n\nFrye et al.\n\ntribute to the compound lensing effect at the 100 level that\nis important for doing precision cosmology with clusters\n(Jullo et al. 2010).\nAbsolute Magnification\n\n20\n15\n10\n5\n0\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\nR [arcsec]\nFig. 10.- Radial magnification profiles for the average magnification inside a circle of radius R (dashed line), and the median\nmagnification in an annulus of 2.500 about R (continuous line) assuming in each case a mean source redshift of z = 0.8 as drawn\nfrom the literature (Frye et al. 2007). The primary and secondary\npeaks appear at the locations of the tangential and radial critical\ncurves, respectively. The net advantage of this lensed field is a\nfactor of \u223c4 integrated over a large R = 15000 (0.5 Mpc) radius.\n\nx10\nx8\n\nE\n\nx6\n\nx5\n\nAbell 1689 is one of the best studied clusters in the literature, with several published lens models (Broadhurst\net al. 2005; Limousin et al. 2007; Halkola et al. 2006;\nLeonard et al. 2007; Zekser et al. 2006; Coe et al. 2010).\nIn this work we adopt the model presented in Broadhurst et al. (2005), which is constructed from 30 multiplyimaged galaxies with supporting multiband photometry\nof the field and spectroscopy of a representative sample\nof the arcs. The Broadhurst et al. (2005) model compares favorably with measurements using an independent\nmodel from the literature (Limousin et al. 2007).\nWe use our lens model for A1689 to construct an\nazimuthally-averaged magnification profile to predict\nsource magnifications (\u03bc) owing to strong lensing. We\nmeasure the magnification straightforwardly by tabulating a grid from the best-fitting magnification map that\nspans roughly the ACS field of view (19000 on a side). Our\nresulting magnification profile is shown in Figure 10, corresponding to the measured mean redshift of background\nobjects in the field drawn from the literature (Frye et al.\n2007) and references therein.\nThe median magnification (\u03bc) peaks at \u03bc=35 and has\na long tail extending towards large radial distances. We\nreport the median magnifications rather than the mean\n\n25\n\nx4\n\n5. CLUSTER LENSING\n\nMedian, in annulus dR\nAverage, in circle\n\n30\n\nx3\n\n4.8. Evolution of F12 ELG1\nIn sum, with its high sSFR corresponding roughly to\na cold gas fraction of \u223c0.7 (Reddy et al. 2005), its low\nmass, and presence of many Balmer series emission lines,\nthis strongly-lensed but otherwise ordinary galaxy would\nappear to be caught at the beginning of a major burst\nof star formation. This is consistent with the picture of\nvan der Wel et al. (2011) in which \u223c1/2 the stars in a\ntypical field galaxy are formed in only \u223c2-3 bursts that\nproduce the stellar population in a M\u2217 =109 M by z\u223c1.\nF12 ELG1 also looks similar to the objects in Kriek et al.\n(2009) that are AGN hosts of size \u223c1 kpc.\nF12 ELG1 has similar ionization properties compared\nto other z=1-2 star-forming galaxies, and as a group such\nobjects have elevated ionizations compared to the local\ngalaxy population. It is thought that galaxy feedback\nmust play a role in understanding these differences. One\npossible explanation is that many intermediate redshift\ngalaxies may harbor weak AGNs (Wright et al. 2010;\nTrump et al. 2011). F12 ELG1 has elevated metal-line\nratios consistent with an AGN that are interestingly offset from the dynamical center of the galaxy. Given this\nextended tail in the same direction, we interpret the\nasymmetrically-situated AGN-like region of this galaxy\nas shock excitation possibly as a result of a past galaxy\ninteraction. The line ratios decrease towards the outer\ndisk on both sides of the peak in this one galaxy, similar to the spatially-resolved spectroscopy of another giant arc at intermediate redshift, the 'Clone' (Jones et al.\n2010). By contrast, in a sample of 50 intermediate redshift ELGs with integral field unit spectroscopy a significant fraction showed the opposite trend (Queyrel et al.\n2011).\n\n35\n\nN\n5''\n\nFig. 11.- Left-hand side: two-dimensional magnification map\nof the lens A1689 (contours) overlaid on the gri image of the blue\ngiant arc at z = 0.7895. The linear magnification varies differentially from \u03bc = 4 \u2212 5 along the arc, enhanced locally by the nearby\ncluster elliptical at right. Seven non-overlapping bins of substructure are overlaid as colored rectangles in both the image and source\nplanes. The bins are oriented and have a size corresponding to the\nposition angle and slit-width of the observations. Right-hand side:\nthe reconstructed source plane image yields a single nucleus with\nan extension that may be a tidal tail.\n\nmagnifications so as not to include the high model magnifications exceeding \u03bc=100.

Given this magnification profile, all the sources in our catalog and behind\nthe cluster are likely magnified. The magnification is\ncomputed in detail for two giant arcs of interest below.\nThe magnification contours for F12 ELG1 are laid\ndown onto the HST gri image in Figure 11. The contours increase in the direction of the two massive cluster\nellipticals appearing just above the \"\u00d710\" magnification\nlabel and in the upper left-hand corner of the image. We\ncompute a magnification that increases from a factor of\nfour to five along the long axis of the arc, with a mean\nvalue that we use for this paper of \u03bc =4.5. This value\nsupercedes a previous measurement (Frye et al. 2002),\nas this one is derived explicitly from the lens model.

OTHER FIELD GALAXIES\n6.1. Double-peaked H\u03b1 in F12 ELG2\nWe report new ELSs detected with the ACS G800L\ngrism which have close angular separations. They are:\nELS 20004 'A,' ELS 11085 'B' (Fig. 12). We designate\nthis group of sources as 'F12 ELG2.' Sources A and B\nhave an angular separation of \u22480.2100 , and are resolved\ndespite the angular separation being slightly smaller than\nour predicted spatial resolution of R0 = 0.25,00 set by our\nalgorithm that extracts a minimum of five spatial pixels\ncentered on an emission line. The spectrum for component A shows two emission line peaks with similar flux\namplitudes. The spectrum for component B shows a single emission line with an extended red tail that appears\nto be associated with at least some of the same emission\nsources as in component A (Fig. 13).\nEmission peaks B and G both have line emission at\nthe same wavelength (see 2d spectrum in Figure 13). In\naddition component G shows extended emission, making\nit the source likely to be most sensitive to the photometric redshift estimate. The photometric redshift for G is\nzBP Z = 0.480 \u00b1 0.145, from which we consider the peak\n'B+G' as [OIII] at z=0.532. As it is unlikely for components B and G to have the same wavelength peak but\nbe unrelated, we take this as the redshift for both components. The morphology of the galaxy nearest to the\nsources is an elliptical which is likely component G (see\nFig. 12). From profile fitting we do not find associated\nH\u03b2. Our double-peaked spectrum (A+G) has a peakto-peak velocity separation of \u223c9600 km s\u22121 . From this\nremarkably-high value we can rule out the interpretation\n\n6500\n\n7000\n\n7500\n8000\nWavelength (\u00c5)\n\n8500\n\n9000\n\n9500\n\nFig. 13.- Spectra of F12 ELG2, which contain new ELSs at close\nangular separations: ELS 20004 'A,' ELS 11085 'B,' and 'G' (see\nFig. 12 for the image). From the line placements and separations\nwe infer there to be one emission line for each of the three components. The spectrum in the top panel is remarkable for showing a\ndouble-peaked emission line profile with a large peak-to-peak velocity difference of \u223c9600 km s\u22121 , and line strengths of roughly\nequal amplitude. Component G shows underlying stellar continuum. Most likely A and G are at z=0.532 while A is at z=0.560,\nalthough additional data are required to confirm these line identifications for this complex system of ELSs.\n\nof this object as two separate ELSs close in space. Most\nlikely, G and B are both at z=0.532, while A is an unrelated source at z=0.560. It is also possible that source A\nand/or B are situated behind the elliptical galaxy, which\nwould alter the above redshift identifications. Additional\nspectroscopy is required at a competitive spatial resolution to identify these emission features and objects.\n6.2. High-z Population\n\nWe detect the highest redshift object with a published\nspectrum in the A1689 field, ELG 10399 at z=5.13 (Frye\net al. 2002). Our grism spectrum is shown in the upper panel. This arclet is faint (iAB = 25.85 \u00b1 0.18) and\nextremely red (g \u2212 i>4), yet is detected in our rather\nshallow grism survey owing to its large rest-frame equivalent width (Wr =29.7+13.29\n\u22124.6 ), its high magnification, and\nits small size of 100 (Fig. 14). We compute a magnification of \u03bc \u2248 4.5, and estimate an intrinsic size for its\nredshift of \u2248 1kpc. There are no counterarcs predicted\nfor this arclet. We identify the lone emission line to be\nLy\u03b1 based on our higher resolution companion spectrum\ntaken with Keck LRIS (blue dashed line) which shows\nalso a Lyman-series break. With its high rest equivalent\nwidth of Wr > 20, this object would appear from the\ngrism spectrum alone to be a Ly\u03b1 emitter, but our Keck\nspectrum shows it to have a Lyman-break seen against\nstellar continuum.\nOf the six galaxies in the field of A1689 with z>2.5 (Table 4), interestingly only this one galaxy at z=5.13 enters\ninto our sample. The Sextet arcs at z=3.038 are not detected, which is not surprising given that the arclet in this\nsextuply-imaged system with the strongest line emission\nhas a Ly\u03b1 total of Wr =4+1.5\n\u22125.0 \u00c5, a value in the lowest single percentile of our sample. It is less well understood\nwhy the bright arclet at z=4.868 is not detected. This ar-\n\n\f12\n\nFrye et al.\nshow a single emission line with a large rest equivalent width (\u223c100 \u00c5).\n\u2022 We report the discovery of F12 ELG1 at z=0.7895,\nwhose spectrum shows several Balmer emission\nlines indicative of a starburst phase for this young,\nlow-mass galaxy with \u223csolar metallicity and M/L\u2248\n1. Offset from the galaxy nucleus by \u223c1kpc we\nmeasure metal line ratios that are consistent with\nthe presence of an AGN, a result that is not apparent in the integrated spectrum. We interpret\nthe presence of a harder ionization source outside\nthe galaxy nucleus to be a result of shocks possibly\ninduced by a recent galaxy interaction.\n\n6\nNormalized Flux\n\nLy\u03b1\n\n4\n\n\u2022 We compute magnification factors for some individual galaxies. We construct a magnification profile\nfor the cluster, and measure a cumulative benefit\ndue to lensing of a factor of 3.75 within the central\n\u2248500 kpc.\n\u2022 We have detected the highest redshift galaxy with\nspectroscopic confirmation, ELG 10399 at z=5.13,\nand we report the discovery of several other objects, including F12 ELG2 with mutiple sources of\nemission at close angular separations.\n\n2\n0\n6500\n\n7000\n7500\n8000\n8500\nObserved Wavelength (\u00c5)\n\nFig. 14.- gri image and spectra of ELG 10399 at z = 5.13\n(i775 = 25.58 \u00b1 0.18). A Lyman-series break is clearly detected\ntogether with a prominent asymmetric emission line which we take\nto be Ly\u03b1 from our Keck LRIS observations (lower spectrum). Our\ngrism results are also shown (upper spectrum). Two other ELSs\nfrom our sample appear in the field. One is ELS 1184 at z = 0.054\nand the other is ELS 1157 at z = 0.195, as marked. Spectroscopic\nredshifts of other objects in the field known from the literature are\nmarked.\n\nclet image has i775 =23.48\u00b10.03, an angular size of \u223c1.3,00\n+8.83\na Ly\u03b1 emission line with Wr =12.4\u22123.84\n\u00c5 (the lowest 10%\nof our sample), and is situated in a relatively uncrowded\nlocation relative to the cluster members. Note we do not\nsee any lone unassociated emission lines of other faint,\npotentially high-redshift objects near to the locations of\nthe tangential critical curve.\n7. SUMMARY AND FUTURE WORK\n\nWe have undertaken a census of emission line galaxies\nin the central portion of A1689 comprising three orbits\nand a single pointing with the HST ACS G800L grism.\nThis is the first grism survey with HST in the field of a\nmassive lensing cluster. We summarize the main results\nbelow.\n\u2022 We present a spectroscopic catalog (Table 1) which\ncontains 66 emission lines in 52 emission line\nsources in 43 galaxies in this flux-limited sample\nwith i775 <\n\u223c 27.3. Three-fourths of the galaxy identifications are new, and one-quarter of the spectra\n\nGiven their high magnifications over large areas, grism\nsurveys in the fields of massive lensing clusters are rich\nyet relatively unexplored territories. In particular lensing can open up the discovery space for galaxies with\nweak Wr emission line sources. For the typical galaxy\nin the background of the cluster, lensing causes both the\ngalaxy's extended stellar continuum to be diluted and the\nstar forming regions to be magnified but remain unresolved. This lensing effect allows the detection threshold\nto be lowered to include weaker Wr ELSs. The exquisite\nspatial resolution of HST further allows for multiple weak\nELSs to be identified in each ELG. Operationally, such\nprograms are free of lengthy selection algorithms, and so\ncan yield rewards even with only modest investments of\ntelescope time.\nACS was developed under NASA contract NAS 532865, and this research has been supported in part by\nNASA grant NAG5-7697 and by an equipment grant\nfrom Sun Microsystems, Inc.

Objects in our ELG sample are indicated by the\nred star-shaped symbols and compared with other objects, including photometric redshifts for cluster members (green diamond shaped\nsymbols) and photometric for all other objects (black triangular shaped symbols). The typical ELG in our sample is bluer than the cluster.\nThe red arrow shows the lower limit in (g \u2212 i) for the g-band dropout galaxy at z=5.13 ELG 10399.\nAPPENDIX\nTHE CATALOG\n\nIn each emission line galaxy (ELG) we detect at least one emission line source (ELS) with one or more emission\nlines (ELs). In all we identify 66 ELs in 52 ELSs in 43 ELGs. A color-magnitude diagram of our sample is shown\nin Figure 15 (red star-shaped symbols), with the green diamond-shaped symbols indicating the positions of cluster\nmembers obtained by photometric redshifts. The black triangle-shaped symbols show all objects in the field with\nmeasured photometric redshifts. Most objects in our sample have colors bluer than the cluster sequence, corresponding\nto roughly g \u2212 i = 1.7 at i775 = 20. All nine H\u03b1 Emitters (HAEs) in our sample that are cluster members are also\nsituated below the cluster sequence. Four ELGs are situated exactly on the cluster sequence. These are not cluster\nmembers and are identified as follows: ELG 11186 (HAE at z = 0.235), ELG 10746 (HAE at z = 0.230), ELG 10226\n(HAE at z = 0.140), and ELG 4277 (HAE at z = 0.462). Of these, ELG 11186 and ELG 10746 are very close to\nthe cluster, and may be foreground galaxies experiencing infall into the cluster gravitational potential well. The three\nELGs above the cluster sequence are: ELG 10399 at z = 5.12 with a lower limit of g \u2212 i = 4, the disk galaxy ELG\n1077 at z = 0.595 with g \u2212 i = 2.24, and the faint and compact object ELG 6621 at z = 0.800 with g \u2212 i = 1.48.\nThe spectroscopic results appear in Table 1 with the following columns: object name, right ascension and declination,\ni775 (AB) magnitude, emission line central wavelength, emission line flux, total rest-frame equivalent width and\n1-\u03c3 errors, line identification, spectroscopic redshift, and a reference to any redshifts in the literature determined\nspectroscopically. Eight line species are identified in our sample: [S II]\u03bb\u03bb6716,6731, H\u03b1, [O III]\u03bb\u03bb4959,5007, H\u03b2, [Ne\nIII]\u03bb3867, He I\u03bb4472, [O II]\u03bb\u03bb3727,3729, and Ly\u03b1. The three doublets in this line list are unresolved at our spectral\nresolution, so we adopt the following vacuum rest wavelengths for their flux-weighted centroids: \u03bb0 ([S II]) = 6723.5 \u00c5,\n\u03bb0 ([O III])=4996.5 \u00c5, and \u03bb0 ([O II])=3728.7 \u00c5. Two people independently measured the rest-frame equivalent widths\n(Wr ) and found consistent results. The uncertainties reported for the line fluxes are 1-\u03c3 errors including continuum\nplacement and photon noise. More than one-fourth of our ELGs have large rest equivalent widths, W > 100 \u00c5.\nLine Identifications\nPreviously published redshifts are the first resource for line identifications. For new ELGs, the objects with multiple\nemission lines make the redshift determination straightforward, taking into account the cases of similar ratios of\nwavelengths between line pairs, such as the similar line ratios of \u03bbH\u03b1/\u03bb[OIII] and \u03bbH\u03b2/\u03bb[OII] (M07). The remainder\nof the catalog consists of single emission lines. Single ELs present challenges as grism observations are not sensitive to\nsmall-scale changes that can serve as redshift-confirming features, such as strong absorption bands and the line shape\nof emission lines closely-separated in velocity space. The treatment of single emission lines relies on the combination\nof photometric redshift, profile fitting and other sanity checks such as the search for continuum depressions and the\nabsence of conflicting emission features. The photometric redshift is derived from a Bayesian approach, described in\ndetail in other papers (Ben\u0131\u0301tez 2000; Ben\u0131\u0301tez et al. 2004; Coe et al. 2006); it is measured including nine bands and\nfound to be a robust redshift indicator (see Fig. 9 in Frye et al. 2007). We fit profiles to distinguish secondary bumps\nin our single emission lines to corroborate the likelihood of, for example, a bonafide [OIII]/H\u03b2 detection. When one\nemission line is observed, the photometric redshift is used to resolve the degenerate possible redshift solutions, resulting\nin a much more accurate redshift than from the photometry alone.\nThe largest source of uncertainty is in establishing the goodness of fit of the zero-point of the wavelength solution.\nIn our blind emission line finding technique, ELs are identified and the offset of the position between the emission line\nand the direct source are computed. The goodness of fit can be measured by comparing the grism and spectroscopic\n\n\f14\n\nFrye et al.\n\nAll lines\n\nM07\n\nH\u03b1\n\nM07\n\n5\n\n0\n\nThis Sample\n\nThis Sample\n\nNumber\n\n5\n0\n\n[OIII]\n\nM07\n\n[OII]\n\nM07\n\n5\n\n0\n\nThis Sample\n\nThis Sample\n\n5\n0\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\nlog(REW[\u00c5])\nFig. 16.- The total rest-frame equivalent width (Wr ) in Angstroms of each emission line in our catalog is plotted as a histogram for all\nobjects, and then also for the three most common line species of H\u03b1, [OII], and [OIII]. The results for this sample appear in black in the\nlower row of each panel and the grism sample of the HDF-N (M07) in gray in the upper row. Our lensed sample includes more weak Wr\nsources of line emission. The effect of lensing is to boost the flux of the unresolved emission lines with respect to the stretched and diluted\nstellar continuum, thereby increasing the signal-to-noise and allowing for lower Wr detection thresholds.\n\nredshifts. From previous studies involving similar datasets and reduction techniques as described in M07, the scatter\nin grism and spectroscopic redshifts is equivalent to an error in position of \u223c1 pixel, or \u2206v=1650 km s\u22121 . In addition,\nthe spectral resolution is low, with R=90 at \u03bb=8500 \u00c5, corresponding to \u2206v=3300 km s\u22121 or about 2.1 pixels. While\nin practice this means that we will have relatively little leverage on measuring kinematics of gas clouds within a disk,\nthe grism has the advantage of obtaining spectroscopy that is spatially resolved on impressively small angular scales\nof \u223c 0.00 2\nLine Demographics\nWe compare line properties sorted by the three most common line species, H\u03b1, [OIII], [OII] (Table 1), and compare\nthese results with a recent HST ACS grism survey in an unlensed field to similar depth, the HDF grism survey (M07).\nBy line species, H\u03b1 emitters are plentiful despite the small sample volume owing to the field selection of a massive\ngalaxy cluster. The median redshift for our sample of HAEs of z = 0.22 is close to the cluster redshift of z = 0.187\nand is dominated by galaxies in the cluster. We measure the median Wr s to be: WH\u03b1 = 29.3 \u00c5, W[OIII] = 67.2 \u00c5,\nand W[OII] = 29.6 \u00c5. These values are large, but typical of grism surveys.\nThe largest difference between this sample and the HDF is in the values of the Wr . One quarter of all of the emitters\nin our sample have Wr \u2265100 \u00c5, compared to three-quarters for the comparison sample (HDF-N, M07). Also, the\nmedian Wr for each line species is smaller than the values in the comparison sample (Fig. 16). The largest shift is\nfound for the HAEs, which are dominated by galaxies in or near to this old and presumably relaxed cluster (z=0.19).\nInterestingly, all of the HAEs in our sample that are brighter than the magnitude limit of the large emission line\nsurvey of B02 of I=19.3 are recovered in our census. Moreover, all of the HAEs in our sample that are fainter than\ntheir limiting magnitude are new to the literature. Thus we find the slitless grism observing approach to be especially\nsensitive to the detection of low-luminosity (and largely unlensed) HAEs with low SFRs. On the other hand, the\nshift in the [OIII] and [OII] emitters towards lower Wr s is owing to lensing. Lensing boosts the brightnesses and sizes\nof the background objects, including the emission lines, with the effect of improving the signal to noise of the grism\nspectra. This effect enables the identification of weaker emission lines with smaller Wr and lower SFR than are found\nin the field. We compute rest-frame B-band magnitudes, MB , by fitting a Bruzual-Charlot model to our optical ACS\nphotometry, and then computing the k-correction onto a Johnson B-band filter template. The mean MB for the 27\n[OIII] emitters is fainter than for the HDF by 1.5 magnitudes, yielding yet another indication of the gravitational\nlensing effect. The shift is not seen for the 21 H\u03b1 emitters or nine [OII] emitters which is dominated by emitters inside\nthe cluster lens and small number statistics, respectively.\nSpecial Cases\nSeven emission lines (ELs) flagged by our purpose-built reduction code were later removed as bogus detections. In\nfive cases the lines were weak and other available spectroscopic data ruled out the grism features as ELs. In two cases,\nthe continuum shapes mimicked an EL but turned out to be stellar continuum. There are three cases for which the\nEL redshifts are not consistent with published redshifts: ELS 1184, ELS 11324, and ELG 6621. We discuss these cases\nbelow.\n\n\fSpatially-resolved Spectroscopy at z=0.7895\n\n15\n\n\u2022 ELS 1184 is in a crowded environment and is separated by only 1.800 from ELS 1157 (see upper left of Fig. 14).\nELS 1157 has multiple emission features confirming the redshift of z = 0.195 for this previously identified object\n(Balogh et al. 2002; Duc et al. 2002). ELS 1184 has a single EL at 6917 \u00c5 that we do not identify with any\nstrong emission feature at or near to z \u223c 0.195. We adopt the foreground redshift z = 0.054 to this compact\nand very bright ELS based on the absence of other expected ELs in the bandpass were the identifications to\ncorrespond to [OIII] or [OII]. We measure a photometric redshift for the Sc galaxy of zBP Z = 0.320 \u00b1 0.129, but\nthis measurement is taken at the position of ELS 1157.\n\u2022 ELG 11324 is in the crowded outer regions of an extended face-on spiral galaxy with a photometric redshift of\nzBP Z = 0.250+0.260\n0.122 and a spectroscopic redshift of z = 0.384 (J. Richard, private communication). We detect a\nsingle EL at 6913.5 \u00c5 which we take to be [OIII] at the spectroscopic redshift.\n\u2022 ELG 6621 is small and faint, with a magnified size of 0.00 3 and i775 = 26.7. The grism spectrum shows a lone\nemission line at 6712.4 \u00c5 with stellar continuum and no salient continuum features. This galaxy suffers from\ncrowding by a second object that is confidently identified from our companion Magellan spectrum as ELG 6621a\nat z = 0.1868. ELG 6621a is a cluster member that is not detected in our grism dataset and that has no feature\nat the position of the grism EL. The photometric redshift for ELG 6621 is zBP Z = 3.780 \u00b1 0.468. If the EL in\nELG 6621 is Ly\u03b1 then the redshift is z=4.52, and we cannot rule out the possibility of high redshift at least\naccording the redshift test available to us (Rhoads et al. 2009). The high redshift scenario would seem unlikely\ngiven that the photometry does not correct for extinction at the cluster redshift, and thus we must attribute\nsome of its 'redness' to its being behind the foreground cluster member. Strictly, the EL can be also H\u03b1, [OII] or\n[OIII]. If the line is [OIII] then z=0.346, in which case we do not detect the non-requisite H\u03b2 EL. Based on the\nlarge observed equivalent width of 772.9 \u00b1 497.9 we adopt a line identification of [OII] at z = 0.800, and admit\nthis as an uncertain redshift in our sample. Note ELG 6621a is detected only in our Magellan spectrum and so\ndoes not appear in Table 1.\nREFERENCES\nAllende Prieto, C., Lambert, D.
