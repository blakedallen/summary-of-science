In spring 1999, a long coordinated observing campaign was\nperformed on the flare star AD Leo, including EUVE, BeppoSAX, the\nVLA, and optical telescopes. The campaign covered a total of 44 days.\nWe obtained high-quality light curves displaying ongoing variability on\nvarious timescales, raising interesting questions on the role of flare-like\nevents for coronal heating. We performed Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests to\ncompare the observations with a large set of simulated light curves composed of statistical flares that are distributed in energy as a power law\nof the form dN/dE \u221d E \u2212\u03b1 with selectable index \u03b1. We find best-fit \u03b1\nvalues slightly above a value of 2, indicating that the extension of the flare\npopulation toward small energies could be important for the generation\nof the overall X-ray emission.\n\n1.\n\nIntroduction\n\nWhile large, episodic stellar flares heat coronal plasma rather efficiently up to\n100 MK for minutes to hours, it is the potentially large number of small, and\neven 'undetected' flares (\"microflares\", \"nanoflares\", e.g., Parker 1988) that have\nrecently attracted the attention of both solar and stellar research. Solar observations show that the flare occurrence rate is distributed in energy as a power\n1\n\n\f2\n\nM. G\u00fcdel et al.\n\nlaw,\n\ndN\n\u221d E \u2212\u03b1\n(1)\ndE\n(e.g., Lin et al. 1984). The value of \u03b1 determines the importance of the lowor high-energetic tail of the distribution: The integration of the energy over the\nenergy distribution (1)\nZ Emax\ndN\nLX \u221d\nEdE\n(2)\nEmin dE\nwith \u03b1 \u2265 2 produces arbitrarily large total emission rates if Emin \u2192 0 (microflares, nanoflares). There is ample evidence that the ensemble of flares play\na fundamental role in the heating of (quiescent) coronae of magnetically active\nstars:\n\u2022 Active stars emit strong gyrosynchrotron radio emission during quiescence:\nEvidence for accelerated (MeV) electrons as in solar flares (G\u00fcdel 1994).\n\u2022 This non-thermal emission correlates with the overall X-ray radiation the\nsame way as solar flares do (G\u00fcdel & Benz 1993; Benz & G\u00fcdel 1994).\n\u2022 The optical U band flare frequency correlates with the quiescent X-ray\nstellar luminosity (Doyle & Butler 1985).\n\u2022 Transition region lines show broadening probably related to explosive events\n(Wood et al. 1996).\n\u2022 Small flare events with energies of the order of 1027 \u22121028 ergs have become\nobservable with the Hubble Space Telescope in cool M dwarfs, proving their\nubiquity in active stellar atmospheres (Robinson et al. 1995).\n\u2022 The structuring of X-ray emitting active coronae is reminiscent of the\nthermal structure of flares (G\u00fcdel et al. 1997) and may be explained by\nthe superposition of a distribution of statistical flares (Kopp & Poletto\n1993; G\u00fcdel 1997).\n\u2022 Solar observations now show the importance of micro- and nanoflares in\ncoronal energy release: \u03b1 = 2.3 \u2212 2.6 for microflares in the quiet corona\n(Krucker & Benz 1998).\nStudies of statistical flare distributions have been rare in the stellar context, due\nto the paucity of relevant data sets. Collura et al. (1988) found a power-law\nindex \u03b1 = 1.52 from EXOSAT observations of dMe stars, while Osten & Brown\n(1999) report \u03b1 = 1.6 for a sample of RS CVn binary systems observed with\nEUVE. In a series of papers (Audard, G\u00fcdel, & Guinan 1999; Audard et al.\n2000; G\u00fcdel et al. 2000a) we have been investigating systematically the role\nof statistical flares in the overall coronal heating of active stars. From a large\nsample of EUVE observations, we found that\n\u2022 relatively steep (\u03b1 = 2 \u2212 2.5) power laws dominate the flare rate distributions, indicating that small flares are important in these coronae.\n\u2022 Statistical heating by flares leads to dominant coronal temperatures in\nagreement with the measurements.\n\n\f3\n\nAD Leo: Heating by Flares?\n3.0\n\ncount rate (s-1)\n\n2.5\n\nI\n\nII\n\nIII\n\nEUVE DS\n\nIV\n\nV\n\n2.0\n1.5\n1.0\n0.5\n\n0.0\n1.1270\u2022104\n\n1.1280\u2022104\n\n1.1290\u2022104\ntime (HJD - 2440000.5)\n\n1.1300\u2022104\n\n1.1310\u2022104\n\nFigure 1.\nEUVE DS light curve of AD Leo, obtained between April\n2, 1999, and May 16, 1999.

The error bars are typically\n\u00b10.01 ct s\u22121 and have been plotted.\n2.\n\nNew Observations of AD Leo: Flares over and over again\n\nAn extremely long EUVE observation of AD Leo was approved during EUVE's\ncycle 7 between April 2 and May 16, 1999 (with a few minor time gaps) comprising 900 ksec of on-source exposure time. The DS instrument and the three\nspectrometers (SW, MW, LW) were used. Between May 1 and May 15, we\nobtained a total of 270 ks of exposure time with BeppoSAX, covering about 8\ndays within this interval. We obtained data from the LECS (0.1\u201310 keV), the\nMECS (2\u201310 keV), and the PDS (15\u2013400 keV) instruments. On April 29, a 10 hr\nintegration was carried out with the VLA. We used the 2 cm, 3.6 cm and 6 cm\nbands with the array in its D configuration. Two optical photometry observatories (Villanova University and Crimean Astrophysical Observatory) observed\nAD Leo in the U, B, V, R, and I bands during several nights in April and May.\nAD Leo is a dM4.5e star with a rotation period of 2.7 d (according to our\n[EFG] measurements, Prot appears to be 1.7 d only). An overview of the EUVE\nand BeppoSAX observations is shown in Figures 1\u22122 (also G\u00fcdel et al. 2000b).\nThe EUVE light curve is extremely variable. Most of the fluctuations visible in\nFig. 1 are real (the error bars being smaller than the visible fluctuations).\n3.\n\nMeasuring the Importance of Flare Heating\n\nThe light curves of AD Leo at hand are ideal for further investigation of statistical flares. We address two questions: (i) What is the statistical distribution\nof the visible flares in energy? (Given the lack of detailed spectroscopy for each\nflare, we approximate the total energy by the total number of counts detected,\ntimes a constant count-to-energy conversion factor.) (ii) Can the complete emission, including the apparently quiescent radiation, be explained by a superposition of statistical flares with a distribution that is compatible with (i)? We use\ntwo approaches to address these issues.\n3.1.\n\nKolmogorov-Smirnov Statistical Tests of the Flux Distribution\n\nHere, we investigate the distribution of count rate values in the light curve. We\nproceed as follows:\n\n\f4\n\nM.

For illustration purposes, the LECS and\nEUVE light curves have been shifted by +1 and +2.5 cts s\u22121 .\n(i) We determine the average flare profile through autocorrelation analysis from\nthe observations.\n(ii) We simulate light curves that are composed of statistical flares. These are\ndistributed in energy according to a power law (1). We use 5480 bins,\nwhich is about ten times the number of bins in the EUVE light curve (if\nbinned to one data point per satellite orbit), i.e., we simulate ten statistical\nrealisations of our observation.\n(iii) The simulation is renormalized to the observation. To this end, we determine the cumulative distribution of flux values both for the observation\nand for the simulations (i.e., number of bins with a flux exceeding a given\nflux - see Figures 3\u22124). We normalize the model flux to the observed flux\nby adjusting the middle portion of the cumulative distribution, which lies\nabove the noise level but at fluxes that are frequently attained.\n(iv) Statistical noise corresponding to the observations is added.\n(v) We then perform a Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) statistical test between simulation and observation by comparing the number distribution of flux values in the available bins. Option: The dominant 'quiescent' part which\nis difficult to model can be subtracted beforehand to avoid problems with\noverlapping flare wings, rotational modulation effects, some true long-term\nvariability etc.\nFigures 3\u22124 show best-fit realisations for different \u03b1 values. The top panel\nshows the data used, the second row refers to the optimum \u03b1 found, while the\nother panels show cases for too large and too small \u03b1. In each case, the solution\nwith the highest confidence was identified by varying the number of flares in the\nsimulation.\n\n\f5\n\nAD Leo: Heating by Flares?\n2.5\n\ncount rate (ct s-1)\n\n2.0\n\nEUVE DS observations\n\n1.5\n\n1.0\n\n0.5\n\n0.0\n0\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\n500\n\ntime\n\n4\n\n1.0\nalpha = 2.3\n\nalpha = 2.3\n\n0.8\ncumulative fraction\n\ncount rate (ct s-1)\n\n3\n\n2\n\n0.6\n\n0.4\n\n0.2\n\n1\n0.0\n0\n\n-0.2\n0\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\n500\n\n0.1\n\ntime\n\n1.0\n\n8000\n\n1.0\nalpha = 1.8\n\n0.8\n6000\n\nalpha = 1.8\ncumulative fraction\n\ncount rate (ct s-1)\n\n10.0\n\ncount rate\n\n4000\n\n0.6\n\n0.4\n\n0.2\n\n2000\n0.0\n0\n\n-0.2\n0\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\n500\n\n0.1\n\ntime\n\n1.0\n\n10.0\n\ncount rate\n\n1.0\n\n1.0\nalpha = 2.7\n\n0.8\n\n0.8\ncumulative fraction\n\ncount rate (ct s-1)\n\nalpha = 2.7\n0.6\n\n0.4\n\n0.2\n\n0.6\n\n0.4\n\n0.2\n\n0.0\n\n0.0\n\n-0.2\n0\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\ntime\n\n400\n\n500\n\n0.1\n\n1.0\n\n10.0\n\ncount rate\n\nFigure 3.\nBest-fit examples of statistical flare simulations for different power-law distributions.

(A): EUVE DS, emission above quiescent level.\n(B): EUVE DS, all emission. (C): BeppoSAX LECS, all emission.\n\nThe left panels show the first 500 bins of the simulated light curves, while the\nright panels show the cumulative distributions of count rates attained for the\nobservation (black, solid) and the simulation (red, dashed). We do not use\nthe lowest 10% of the distribution since those flux levels may be influenced\nby slowly varying emission in the 'quiescent' emission. The vertical differences\nbetween the simulated and the observed distribution are indicated dotted (blue)\naround the zero level: deviations to positive values indicate a locally too soft\nsimulated distribution, negative deviations indicate locally too hard simulated\ndistributions. The maximum deviation is indicated by a blue vertical bar. The\n(green) dashed horizontal line indicates the lower threshold for identifying the\nmaximum vertical difference.\nSince the last segment in the EUVE DS light curve suffered from incursion\ninto the DS dead spot and from elevated particle radiation, we omitted that\nsegment in our analysis. We plot in Fig. 5 the best results for different \u03b1 values,\nfor three cases: (i) Modeling of the EUVE DS emission above the 'quiescent'\nlevel (A); (ii) modeling of the complete EUVE DS emission (B); (iii) modeling the complete BeppoSAX LECS light curve (C). Acceptable models (>90%\nconfidence) are found for \u03b1 = 2.2 \u2212 2.5.\n\n\f8\n\nM. G\u00fcdel et al.\n\n3.2.\n\nEffect of Weak Flares\n\nThe high time-resolution of the EUV events (\u223c 1ms) also affords the possibility of detecting weaker flares in the light-curve (see Kashyap et al. 2000). By\ncomparing the distribution of photon arrival-time differences in the data stream\nwith that expected from a model of flare distributions with specific power-law\nindices, we can account for the weak (but numerous) flares that contribute to\nthe emission. Specifically, we\n(i) adopt a power-law flare-distribution model (Equation 1) described by the\npower-law index \u03b1 and the normalization Nf , and generate a high-timeresolution light-curve via Monte-Carlo simulation;\n(ii) add a constant component Nb to the flare light-curve to account for true\nsteady emission, flare emission too weak to be distinguished from steady\nemission, and background;\n(iii) obtain a set of event times from the model light curve;\n(iv) compare the observed distribution of arrival-time differences with that\nderived from the generated model event-times and compute a test statistic\nsimilar to \u03c72r ; and\n(v) carry out the comparison over a grid of parameter values (\u03b1, Nf , Nb ) to\nfind the best-fit and confidence range.\nWe have run the above algorithm on the first half of segment II of the AD Leo\nEUVE observation (see Figure 1) and find that \u03b1 = 2.1 \u00b1 0.05, a smaller value\nthan found above, but yet > 2. These data are clearly dominated by the large\nflare; an analysis of longer segments, which is expected to reduce the bias due to\nthis flare and provide a more realistic assessment of the value of \u03b1, is in progress.\n4.\n\nDiscussion and Conclusions\n\nThe analysis performed so far on EUVE light curves (Audard et al. 1999; 2000;\nalso Kashyap et al. 2000) and the new results presented here suggest a distribution of flare energies according to a power law with a steep index: \u03b1 \u2248 2 \u2212 3.\nIf the flare rate distribution continues down to levels of average solar flares, then\nthe complete stellar corona could be heated solely by the energy released in\nstatistical flares.\nThe results suggest values of \u03b1 \u2248 2.1 \u2212 2.5 independent of whether only the\ndetected flares are investigated, or whether the complete emission is simulated.\nThis suggests that (i) the extrapolation of the flare distribution to undetected\nflare energy levels could add large amounts of emission, and (ii) that the complete\nstatistical distribution of count rate levels is indeed compatible with such a\ndistribution. The two points require a lower threshold for the power-law flare\ndistribution to confine the emission to the observed level. This has implicitly\nbeen taken into account as our simulated power-law distributions contain flares\nonly with energies above a pre-set lower threshold. The value of the latter is\ndetermined by the normalization to the observation.\n\n\fAD Leo: Heating by Flares?\n\n9\n\nFlares could then also explain why the temperatures of active stars become increasingly hotter with 'increasing activity': The higher flare rate keeps\nmore (high-density) plasma at hot temperatures, and thus the hotter plasma\nincreasingly dominates the X-ray emission (G\u00fcdel 1997; Audard et al. 2000).\nAcknowledgments.
