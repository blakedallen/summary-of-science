Introduction\nWe study the classical Cahn-Hilliard equation\n(1.1)\n\n\u2202t u = \u2206x (\u2212\u2206x u + f (u) + g)\n\nconsidered in the whole space x \u2208 R3 .\nIt is well-known that the Cahn-Hillard (CH) equation is central for the material sciences and\nextensive amount of papers are devoted to the mathematical analysis of this equation and various\nof its generalizations. In particular, in the case where the underlying domain \u03a9 is bounded, the\nanalytic and dynamic properties of the CH equations are relatively well-understood including\nthe questions of well-posedness (even in the case of singular potentials f ) and dissipativity,\nsmoothness, existence of global and exponential attractors, upper and lower bounds for the\ndimension, etc. We mention here only some contributors, namely, [7, 10, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21,\n22, 12, 24, 26, 27, 29, 30, 34] (see also the references therein).\nThe situation in the case where the underlying domain is unbounded is essentially less clear\neven in the case of finite-energy solutions. Indeed, the key feature of the CH equation in\nbounded domains which allows to build up a reasonable theory (especially in the case of rapidly\ngrowing or singular nonlinearities) is the possibility to obtain good estimates in the negative\nSobolev space W \u22121,2 (\u03a9) and, to this end, one should use the inverse Laplacian (\u2212\u2206x )\u22121 . But,\nunfortunately this operator is not good in unbounded domains (in particular, does not map\n2000 Mathematics Subject Classification. 35B41, 35L05, 74K15.\nKey words and phrases. Cahn-Hilliard equation, unbounded domains, infinite-energy solutions.\nThe authors would like to thank Alain Miranville for fruitful comments.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nL2 (R3 ) to L2 (R3 )) and this makes the greater part of the analytic tools developed for the\nCH equation unapplicable to the case of unbounded domains. One exception is the case of\ncylindrical domains \u03a9 and Dirichlet boundary conditions where the inverse Laplacian is welldefined and the theory of finite-energy solutions can be built straightforwardly combining the\nusual Cahn-Hilliard technique and the technique of weighted estimates (see [1, 4, 25, 15, 37]).\nThe infinite-energy solutions (including regular and singular potentials, uniqueness, dissipativity\nand attractors, etc.) for that case have been recently studied in [13], see also [5].\nHowever, despite the general theory of dissipative PDEs in unbounded domains which seems\nhighly developed now-a-days (see the surveys [25] and [2] and references therein), behavior of\nsolutions of the CH equation in the whole space remains badly understood. Indeed, to the best\nof our knowledge, only the local results in this direction are available in the literature, like the\nnonlinear (diffusive) stability of relatively simple equilibria (e.g., kink-type solutions), relaxation\nrates to that equilibria, asymptotic expansions in a small neighborhood of them, etc., see [6, 23]\nand references therein (we also mention [11] where some results on the long-time behavior of\nfinite-energy solutions are obtained for the case of so-called viscous CH equations).\nThe situation becomes even worse for more general infinite-energy solutions (e.g., for the\ninitial data belonging to L\u221e (Rn ) only). In this case, even the global existence of a solution\nwas not known for the simplest cubic nonlinearity f (u) = u3 \u2212 u (again, to the best of our\nknowledge) and the boundedness of solutions as t \u2192 \u221e is established only if f (u) is linear\noutside of a compact set in R, see [8].\nThe aim of the present paper is exactly to give the positive answer on the question of global\nwell-posedness of the CH equations in R3 in the class of uniformly local spaces. Although our\nestimates are not strong enough to establish the global boundedness of solutions in L\u221e (R3 ) like\nin [8], we are able to treat a much more general class of nonlinearities including the case of\nregular potentials with arbitrary polynomial growth rate as well as the case of sufficiently strong\nsingular potentials. Moreover, our upper bounds on solutions show that they can grow at most\npolynomially in time, see Theorems 3.1 and 6.1 below.\nIn addition, we also study the so-called Cahn-Hilliard-Oono equation\n(1.2)\n\n\u2202t u = \u2206x (\u2212\u2206x u + f (u) + g) \u2212 \u03bbu,\n\nwhere the extra term \u03bbu, \u03bb > 0 models the non-local long-ranged interactions, see [31, 28] for\nmore details. As we will show below, the presence of this extra term drastically changes the\nsituation with regard to the long-time behavior and allows us to obtain not only the global\nboundedness of solutions, but also their dissipativity, and existence of a locally-compact global\nattractor, etc. Note that these results hold for all polynomial nonlinearities (satisfying the\nnatural dissipativity assumptions) as well as for sufficiently strong singular potentials. Although\nwe cannot cover the case of logarithmic nonlinearities, we are able to treat equation (1.2) with\nu\n\u2212 Ku\n(1.3)\nf (u) \u223c\n(1 \u2212 u2 )\u03b3\n\nand \u03b3 \u2265 5/3.\nThe paper is organized as follows.\nThe definitions and key facts on the weighted and uniformly local Sobolev spaces which will\nbe used throughout of the paper are briefly discussed in Section 2.\nThe key a priori estimate which gives at most polynomial growth rate in time for the infiniteenergy solutions of (1.1) is derived in Section 3 for the case of regular potentials. The uniqueness\nand further regularity of these solutions are verified in Section 4.\nSection 5 is devoted to the extension of the above results to the Cahn-Hilliard-Oono equation.\nIn particular, the dissipative estimate for the solutions of that equation is presented there.\nFinally, the Cahn-Hilliard and Cahn-Hilliard-Oono equations with singular potentials are\nconsidered in Section 6.\n\n\f3\n\n2. Preliminaries: weighted and uniformly local spaces\nIn this section, the definitions and key properties of the weighted and uniformly local Sobolev\nspaces needed for what follows are briefly recorded, see [15, 25, 36, 38] for a more detailed\nexposition. We start with introducing the class of suitable weight functions.\n3\nA function \u03c6 \u2208 L\u221e\nloc (R ) is called a weight function with exponential rate of growth (\u03bd > 0) if\nthe conditions\n(2.1)\n\n\u03c6(x) > 0 and\n\n\u03c6(x + y) \u2264 Ce\u03bd|x| \u03c6(y) ,\n\nare satisfied for every x, y \u2208 R3 .\nAny weight function with growth rate \u03bd also satisfies\n\n\u03c6(x + y) \u2265 C \u22121 e\u2212\u03bd|x| \u03c6(y)\n\nfor all x, y \u2208 R3 . Important examples of weight functions with growth rate \u03bd, are\n\u221a\n1\n\u2212 |\u03b5x|2 +1\n,\n(2.2)\n\u03c6\u03b5 (x) =\nand\n\u03c6\n(x)\n=\ne\n\u03b3\n\u03b5\n(1 + |\u03b5x|2 ) 2\nwhere \u03b3 \u2208 R is arbitrary and \u03b5 < \u03bd in the second example. Crucial for what follows is the fact\nthat these functions satisfy (2.1) uniformly with respect to \u03b5 \u2192 0. Moreover, if \u03c6(x) satisfies\n(2.1), then the shifted weight function \u03c6(x \u2212 x0 ), x0 \u2208 R3 , also satisfies (2.1) with the same\nconstants C and \u03bd.\nIt is not difficult to check that the second weight function satisfies\n|DxN \u03c6\u03b5 (x)| \u2264 CN \u03b5N \u03c6\u03b5 (x)\n\n(2.3)\n\nfor all N \u2208 N and the constant CN is independent of \u03b5 \u2192 0 (here and below DxN stands for the\ncollection of all partial derivatives of order N with respect to x). In addition, the first weight\nfunction \u03c6\u03b5 (x) satisfies the improved version of (2.3)\n(2.4)\n\n\u2032 N\n|DxN \u03c6\u03b5 (x)| \u2264 CN \u03b5N [\u03c6\u03b5 (x)]1+N/\u03b3 \u2264 CN\n\u03b5 \u03c6\u03b5 (x),\n\n\u2032 is also independent of \u03b5 \u2192 0. Furthermore, to verify the dissipativity of the Cahnwhere CN\nHilliard-Oone equation, we will need to consider the weight functions \u03c6\u03b5(t) (x) where the parameter \u03b5 = \u03b5(t) depends explicitly on time. In this case,\n\n\u2202t \u03c6\u03b5(t) (x) = \u03b5\u2032 (t)\nand, therefore,\n(2.5)\n\nx\n\u03b5\u2032 (t)\n|\u03b5(t)x|2\n* \u2207x \u03c6\u03b5(t) (x) = \u03b3\n\u03c6\u03b5(t) (x)\n\u03b5(t)\n\u03b5(t)\n1 + |\u03b5(t)x|2\n\n|\u2202t \u03c6\u03b5(t) (x)| \u2264 \u03b3\n\n|\u03b5\u2032 (t)|\n\u03c6 (x), x \u2208 R3 .\n\u03b5(t) \u03b5(t)\n\nWe are now ready to introduce the weighted and uniformly local spaces which will be used\nthroughout the paper.\nDefinition 2.1. For any 1 \u2264 p \u2264 \u221e, the uniformly local Lebesgue space Lpb (R3 ) is defined as\nfollows:\n(\n)\n(2.6)\n\nLpb (R3 ) :=\n\nu \u2208 Lploc (R3 ) : kukLp := sup kukLp (Bx1\nb\n\nx0 \u2208R3\n\n0\n\n)\n\n<\u221e ,\n\nwhere BxR0 stands for the R-ball in R3 centered at x0 .\nFurthermore, for any weight function \u03c6(x) with exponential rate of growth, we define the\nweighted Lebesgue spaces:\n)\n(\n\u00131/p\n\u0012Z\np\np\np\n3\n3\n<\u221e .\n\u03c6(x)|u(x)| dx\nL\u03c6 (R ) = u \u2208 Lloc (R ) : kukLp :=\n\u03c6\n\nR3\n\n\f4\n\nAnalogously, the weighted (W\u03c6l,p (R3 )) and uniformly local (Wbl,p (R3 )) are defined as subspaces of\nD \u2032 (R3 ) of distributions whose derivatives up to order l belong to Lp\u03c6 (R3 ) or Lpb (R3 ) respectively\n(this works for natural l only, the weighted Sobolev spaces with fractional/negative number of\nderivatives can be also defined in a standard way using interpolation/duality).\nThe following proposition gives the technical tool for estimating the uniformly local norms of\nsolutions using the energy estimates in weighted Sobolev spaces.\nProposition 2.2. Let \u03c6 be a weight function with exponential growth such that k\u03c6kL1 (R3 ) < \u221e\nand let u \u2208 Lpb (R) for some 1 \u2264 p < \u221e. Then, u \u2208 Lp\u03c6 (R3 ) and\n1/p\n\nkukLp \u2264 Ck\u03c6kL1 kukLp ,\n\n(2.7)\n\nb\n\n\u03c6\n\nwhere the constant C depends only on p and the constants C and \u03bd in (2.1) (and is independent\nof the concrete choice of the functions \u03c6 and u). Moreover,\n(2.8)\n\nkukL2 \u2264 C sup kukL2\nb\n\n\u03c6(*\u2212x0 )\n\nx0 \u2208R3\n\n,\n\nwhere C is also independent of the concrete choice of u and \u03c6.\nFor the proof of this proposition, see [15] or [38].\nWe will mainly use estimate (2.7) in the situation where \u03c6 = \u03c6\u03b5 is one of the special weight\nfunctions of (2.2) and \u03b5 > 0 is a small parameter. In this case, for \u03b3 > 3, we have k\u03c6\u03b5 kL1 \u223c \u03b5\u22123\nand (2.7) reads\nkvkLp \u2264 C\u03b5\u22123/p kvkLp ,\n\n(2.9)\n\n\u03c6\u03b5\n\nb\n\nwhere the constant C > 0 is independent of \u03b5 \u2192 0.\nIn the sequel, we will need also the proper spaces for functions of time with values in some\nuniformly local space, say u : [0, T ] \u2192 Wbl,p (R3 ). With a slight abuse of notations, we denote by\nLqb ([0, T ], W l,p (R3 )) the subspace of distributions generated by the following norm:\n(2.10)\n\nkukLq ([0,T ],W l,p) :=\nb\n\nb\n\nsup\n(t,x0 )\u2208[0,T \u22121]\u00d7R3\n\nkukLq ([t,t+1],W l,p (Bx1\n\n0\n\n)) .\n\nRemark 2.3. Note that a more standard definition of Lqb ([0, T ], Wbl,p (R3 )) would be via the\nfollowing norm:\n\u00131/q\n\u0012Z t+1\nq\n(2.11)\nkukLq ([0,T ],W l,p(R3 )) := sup\nku(t)k l,p dt\nb\n\nb\n\nt\u2208[0,T \u22121]\n\nt\n\nWb\n\nwhich differs from (2.10) by the changed order of supremum over x0 \u2208 R3 and integral in time\nand is slightly stronger than (2.10). The main reason to use (2.10) instead of (2.11) is that the\nfirst norm can be estimated through the associated weighted space analogously to (2.8) which\nis essential since all estimates in uniformly local spaces are usually obtained with the help of\nthe associated weighted estimates. Thus, exactly the first norm gives the natural and useful\ngeneralization of the space Lq ([0, T ], W l,p (R3 )) to the uniformly local case and the second norm\n(2.11) which requires more delicate additional arguments to be properly estimated has only a\nrestricted interest.\n3. The key estimate and global existence\nIn this section, we derive the key a priori weighted estimate for the solutions of the CahnHilliard equation\n(3.1)\n\n\u2202t u = \u2206x \u03bc, \u03bc := \u2212\u2206x u + f (u) + g(x), u\n\nt=0\n\n= u0\n\n\f5\n\nwhich allows to verify the existence of global in time solutions in the proper uniformly local\nSobolev spaces (the uniqueness of that solutions will be discussed in the next section). Here\nu = u(t, x) and \u03bc = \u03bc(t, x) are unknown order parameter and chemical potential respectively,\n\u2206x is a Laplacian with respect to x and f and g are given nonlinearity and external forces\nrespectively.\nWe assume that the nonlinearity f (u) = f0 (u) + \u03c8(u) satisfies\n\uf8f1\n\u2032\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f21. f0 (u) \u2265 1, f0 (0) = 0,\n(3.2)\n2. |\u03c8(u)| + |\u03c8 \u2032 (u)| \u2264 C,\n\uf8f4\nRu\n\uf8f3\n3. |f (u)| \u2264 \u03b1|F (u)| + C, F (u) := 0 f (v) dv,\n\nwhere \u03b1 > 0. In particular, all polynomials of odd order with positive first coefficient satisfy\nthese assumptions, in addition, some potentials of exponential growth rate are also allowed by\nthese assumptions. Note that, due to the first and second assumptions of (3.2), we have\nF (u) \u2265 \u03b2|u|2 \u2212 C, u \u2208 R\n\nfor some positive constants \u03b2 and C.\nWe also assume that the external forces g \u2208 L6b (R3 ) and the initial data u0 belongs to the\nspace \u03a6b defined as follows:\n(3.3)\n\n\u03a6b := {u \u2208 Wb1,2 (R3 ), F (u) \u2208 L1b (R3 )}.\n\nWe say that u is a solution of (3.1)\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f21.\n(3.4)\n2.\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\n3.\n\non the time interval t \u2208 [0, T ] if\nu(t) \u2208 \u03a6b , t \u2208 [0, T ];\nu(t) \u2208 C([0, T ], L2loc (R3 ));\n\u03bc \u2208 L2b ([0, T ], Wb1,2 (R3 ))\n\nand equation (3.1) is satisfied in the sense of distributions.

Let the above assumptions hold. Then, for every T > 0, equation (3.1) possesses\nat least one solution in the sense of (3.4) which satisfies the following estimate:\n(3.5) ku(t)k2W 1,2 + kF (u(t))kL1 + k\u2207x \u03bck2L2 ([0,t]\u00d7R3 ) \u2264\nb\nb\nb\n\u00115/2\n\u0010\n,\n\u2264 C(1 + t4 ) 1 + kgk2L6 + ku0 k2W 1,2 + kF (u0 )kL1\nb\n\nb\n\nb\n\nwhere the constant C is independent of u, g and t.\n\nProof. We will give below only the formal derivation of the key a priori estimate (3.5). The\nexistence of solutions can be then deduced using the approximation of the infinite energy data\n(u0 , g) by the finite energy functions (un0 , gn ) (for which the existence and regularity of a solution\nis immediate and the derivation of (3.5) is justified) and passing to the limit in a local topology.\nSince these arguments are standard, see e.g., [15, 13, 37], we leave them to the reader and\nconcentrate ourselves on the derivation of the key estimate.\nLet us use the polynomial weight functions\n1\n, \u03c6\u03b5,x0 (x) := \u03c6(\u03b5(x \u2212 x0 )), \u03b5 > 0, x0 \u2208 R3 .\n(3.6)\n\u03c6(x) :=\n(1 + |x|2 )5/2\n\n\f6\n\nwhich corresponds to (2.2) with \u03b3 = 5 and satisfies the assumption \u03c6\u03b5 \u2208 L1 (R3 ). Then, these\nweights satisfy estimate (2.4) uniformly also with respect to x0 \u2208 R3 .\nWe now multiply equation (3.1) by \u03c6\u03b5 \u03bc = \u03c6\u03b5,x0 \u03bc and integrate over x. Then, after straightforward computations, we get\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1\nd\n2\n(F (u), \u03c6\u03b5 ) + (|\u2207x u| , \u03c6\u03b5 ) + (g, \u03c6\u03b5 u) + (|\u2207x \u03bc|2 , \u03c6\u03b5 ) =\n(3.7)\ndt\n2\n1\n= (|\u03bc|2 , \u2206x \u03c6\u03b5 ) + (\u2207x \u03bc, \u2207x (\u2207x \u03c6\u03b5 * \u2207x u)).\n2\nIn order to estimate the left-hand side of this equation, we need the following two lemmas.\nLemma 3.2. Let the above assumptions hold. Then the following inequality holds:\n(3.8)\n\n6\n\u22123\n6\n(\u03c63\u03b5 , |f (u)|6 ) \u2264 C1 k\u2207x (\u03c61/2\n\u03b5 \u03bc)kL2 + C2 \u03b5 (1 + kgkL6 ),\nb\n\nwhere the constants Ci are independent of \u03b5.\nProof. We rewrite the equation for \u03bc as follows\n(3.9)\nand multiply it by\nup with\n\n\u2212 \u2206x u + f0 (u) = \u03bc \u2212 \u03c8(u) \u2212 g\n\n\u03c63\u03b5 f0 (u)|f0 (u)|4 .\n\nThen, integrating by parts and using that f0\u2032 (u) \u2265 0, we end\n\n(\u03c63\u03b5 , |f0 (u)|6 ) \u2264 |(\u2206x (\u03c63\u03b5 ), F6 (u))| + (\u03c63\u03b5 (\u03bc + \u03c8(u) \u2212 g, f0 (u)|f0 (u)|4 ),\nRu\nwhere F6 (u) := 0 f0 (u)|f0 (u)|4 du. We also note that, due to the monotonicity of f0 ,\n\n(3.10)\n\n|F6 (u)| \u2264 |u||f0 (u)|5 \u2264 |f0 (u)|6\n\nand, therefore, due to (2.4), the first term in the right-hand side of (3.10) is absorbed by the\nleft-hand side if \u03b5 is small enough. Then, estimating the second term in the right-hand side by\nH\u00f6lder inequality and using that \u03c8 is bounded, we obtain\n(3.11)\n\n(\u03c63\u03b5 , |f0 (u)|6 ) \u2264 C(\u03c63\u03b5 , |\u03bc|6 ) + C(|g|6 + 1, \u03c63\u03b5 ).\n\nUsing now estimate (2.9) with p = 1 together with the Sobolev inequality\n(3.12)\n\nkvkL6 \u2264 Ck\u2207x vkL2 ,\n\nwe end up with\n\u22123\n6\n6\n(\u03c63\u03b5 , |f0 (u)|6 ) \u2264 Ck\u2207x (\u03c61/2\n\u03b5 \u03bc)kL2 + C\u03b5 (kgkL6 + 1)\nb\n\nwhich implies (3.8) and finishes the proof of the lemma.\n\n\u0003\n\nLemma 3.3. Let the above assumptions hold. Then, the following estimate is valid:\n(3.13)\n\n(\u03c6\u03b5 , |Dx2 u|2 ) \u2264 C(\u03c6\u03b5 , |\u2207x \u03bc|2 ) + C(\u03c6\u03b5 , |\u2207x u|2 ) + C(\u03c6\u03b5 , |g|2 ),\n\nwhere the constant C is independent of \u03b5 and Dx2 u means the collection of all second derivatives\nof u with respect to x.\nProof. Indeed, multiplying (3.9) by \u2212\u2207x (\u03c6\u03b5 \u2207x u), integrating by parts and using the monotonicity of f0 (u) together with (2.4), we have after standard estimates that\n(3.14)\n\n(\u03c6\u03b5 , |\u2206x u|2 ) \u2264 C(\u03c6\u03b5 , |\u2207x \u03bc|2 ) + C(\u03c6\u03b5 , |\u2207x u|2 ) + C(\u03c6\u03b5 , |g|2 ),\n\nso we only need to estimate the mixed second derivatives of u based on (3.14). To this end, we\nnote that\nX\n(\u03c6\u03b5 , |\u2206x u|2 ) =\n(\u03c6\u03b5 \u2202x2i u, \u2202x2j u)\ni,j\n\n\f7\n\nand, for i 6= j\n(\u03c6\u03b5 \u2202x2i u, \u2202x2j u) = \u2212(\u03c6\u03b5 \u2202xi u, \u2202xi \u2202x2j u) \u2212 (\u2202xi \u03c6\u03b5 \u2202xi u, \u2202x2j u) = (\u03c6\u03b5 , |\u2202x2i xj u|2 )+\n\n+ (\u2202xj \u03c6\u03b5 , \u2202xi u, \u2202xi \u2202xj u) + (\u2202xi \u03c6\u03b5 , \u2202x2i xj u\u2202xj u) + (\u2202x2i xj \u03c6\u03b5 , \u2202xi u\u2202xj u) =\n1\n1\n= (\u03c6\u03b5 , |\u2202x2i xj u|2 ) + (\u2202x2i xj \u03c6\u03b5 , \u2202xi u\u2202xj u) \u2212 (\u2202x2i \u03c6\u03b5 , |\u2202xj u|2 ) \u2212 (\u2202x2j \u03c6\u03b5 , |\u2202x2i u|2 )\n2\n2\nwhich together with (3.14) and (2.4) imply (3.13) and finishes the proof of the lemma.\n\u0003\nWe are now ready to finish the derivation of the key estimate. To this end, we note that due\nto assumptions (3.2) on the nonlinearity f (u), there exists a constant C (independent of \u03b5) such\nthat the function\n1\n(3.15)\nE\u03c6\u03b5 (t) := (F (u(t)), \u03c6\u03b5 ) + (|\u2207x u(t)|2 , \u03c6\u03b5 ) + C\u03b5\u22123 (kgk2L2 + 1)\nb\n2\nsatisfies the inequalities\n1\n(3.16) (|F (u(t))|, \u03c6\u03b5 ) + (|\u2207x u(t)|, \u03c6\u03b5 ) \u2264 E\u03c6\u03b5 (t) \u2264\n2\n1\n\u2264 (|F (u(t))|, \u03c6\u03b5 ) + (|\u2207x u(t)|, \u03c6\u03b5 ) + C \u2032 \u03b5\u22123 (1 + kgk2L2 ),\nb\n2\n\u2032\nwhere the constant C is independent of \u03b5.

Then this function satisfies estimate (2.3) uniformly also with respect\nto x0 \u2208 R3 .\nWe multiply (4.3) by the following function:\n(4.4)\n\n\u2212\u2207x (\u03c6\u03b5 \u2207x ((\u2212\u2206x + 1)\u22121 v)) + \u03c6\u03b5 (\u2212\u2206x + 1)\u22121 v = \u03c6\u03b5 v \u2212 \u2207x \u03c6\u03b5 * \u2207x ((\u2212\u2206x + 1)\u22121 v)\n\nand integrate over x.

Applying the Gronwall\ninequality to this relation, taking the supremum over x0 \u2208 R3 and using (2.8), we end up with\n(4.2) and finish the proof of the theorem.\n\u0003\nThe next several simple corollaries of the proved theorem show that the constructed solution\nu is smooth.\nCorollary 4.2. Let the above assumptions hold and let, in addition, u0 be smooth enough to\nguarantee that \u2202t u(0) \u2208 Wb\u22121,2 (R3 ). Then, \u2202t u(t) \u2208 Wb\u22121,2 for all t \u2265 0 and its norm grows at\nmost polynomially in time.

Indeed, differentiating equation (3.1) in time and denoting v(t) := \u2202t u(t), we see that v\nsolves the equation\n(4.13)\n\n\u2202t v = \u2206x (\u2212\u2206x v + f \u2032 (u)v), v\n\nt=0\n\n= \u2202t u(0)\n\nwhich is almost identical to equation (4.3). Therefore, denoting by w(t) := (\u2212\u2206x + 1)\u22121 v(t) and\narguing exactly as in the proof of the theorem, we derive that\nd\nk\u2202t u(t)k2W \u22121,2 \u2264 C(t)k\u2202t u(t)k2W \u22121,2 ,\n\u03c6\u03b5\n\u03c6\u03b5\ndt\nwhere C(t) grows polynomially in time. This estimate, together with (3.30) proves both assertions of the corollary.\n\u0003\n\n(4.14)\n\nCorollary 4.3. Let the above assumptions hold and let, in addition, u0 \u2208 Wb2,6 (R3 ).

Rewriting the Cahn-Hilliard equation in the form\n\u03bc = \u2212(\u2212\u2206x + 1)\u22121 \u2202t u(t) + (\u2212\u2206x + 1)\u22121 \u03bc\n\nand using the maximal regularity for the Laplacian in the uniformly local spaces, we see that\n(4.15)\n\nk\u03bc(t)kW 1,2 \u2264 Ck\u2202t u(t)kW \u22121,2 + Ck\u03bc(t)kW \u22121,2 .\nb\n\nb\n\nb\n\nMoreover, according to Theorem 3.1, we have\n(4.16) k\u03bc(t)kW \u22122,2 \u2264 Ck(\u2212\u2206x + 1)\u22121 (\u2206x u(t) \u2212 f (u(t)) + g)kL2 \u2264\nb\n\nb\n\n\u2264 C(ku(t)kW 1,2 + kgkL2 + kf (u(t))kL1 ) \u2264 C(ku(t)k\u03a6b + kgkL6 ) \u2264 C(t, u0 , g).\nb\n\nb\n\nb\n\nb\n\nThus, due to (4.15), (4.16) and interpolation, we have\n(4.17) k\u03bc(t)kL6 \u2264 Ck\u03bc(t)kW 1,2 \u2264\nb\n\nb\n\n\u2264 C(k\u2202t u(t)kW \u22121,2 + ku(t)k\u03a6b + kgkL6 ) \u2264 Ck\u2202t u(t)kW \u22121,2 + C(t, u0 , g),\nb\n\nb\n\nb\n\nwhere the constant C(t, u0 , g) grows polynomially in time.\nEstimate (4.17) together with Corollary 4.2 give the assertion of Corollary 4.3 for the L6b norm of \u03bc. In order to obtain the analogous assertions for the Wb2,6 -norm of u, we apply the\nL6b -maximal regularity theorem for the semilinear equation (3.9) which gives\n(4.18)\n\nku(t)kW 2,6 \u2264 C(1 + k\u03bc(t)kL6 ) \u2264 C1 (k\u2202t u(t)kW \u22121,2 + ku(t)k\u03a6b + kgkL6 ),\nb\n\nb\n\nb\n\nb\n\nThus, the corollary is proved.\n\n\u0003\n\nRemark 4.4. The proved regularity is more than enough to initialize the standard bootstraping\nprocess and to verify that the factual smoothness of u(t) is restricted by the smoothness of f\nand g only. In particular, if both of them are C \u221e -smooth the solution will be C \u221e -smooth as\nwell. If they are, in addition, real analytic, one has the real analytic in x solution u(t, x) as well\n(for t > 0).\n5. Dissipative estimate for the Cahn-Hilliard-Oono equation\nIn this section we apply the above developed techniques to the so-called Cahn-Hillard-Oono\nequation\n(5.1)\n\n\u2202t u = \u2206x \u03bc \u2212 \u03bbu, \u03bc := \u2212\u2206x u + f (u) + g(x), u\n\nt=0\n\n= u0\n\nwhich differs from the classical Cahn-Hilliard equation by the presence of an extra term \u03bbu\nwhere the constant \u03bb > 0. The extra dissipative term has been initially introduced to model\nthe long-range nonlocal interactions (see [31] and also [28] for further details) and essentially\nsimplifies the analysis of the long-time behavior of the Cahn-Hilliard equations in unbounded\ndomains and as we will see, guarantees the dissipativity of the equation in the uniformly local\nspaces. To be more precise, the following theorem can be considered as the main result of the\nsection.\nTheorem 5.1. Let the assumptions of Theorem 3.1 hold. Then the Cahn-Hilliard-Oono equation\n(5.1) possesses at least one global in time solution in the sense of (3.4) (for all T > 0) which\nsatisfies the following estimate:\n(5.2) ku(t)k2W 1,2 + kF (u(t))kL1 + k\u2207x \u03bck2L2 ([t,t+1]\u00d7R3 ) \u2264\nb\n\nb\n\nb\n\n\u2264 Q(kgkL6 ) + Q(ku(0)k2W 1,2 + kF (u(0))kL1 )e\u2212\u03c3t , t \u2265 0,\nb\n\nb\n\nb\n\nfor some monotone increasing function Q and positive constant \u03c3 independent of the initial data\nu0 and t \u2265 0.\n\n\f12\n\nProof. The proof of this theorem is analogous to Theorem 5.1, but the presence of the dissipative\nterm \u03bbu produces the extra term \u03bb0 V\u03b5 (t) in the left-hand side of (3.23) with some positive\n\u03bb0 independent of \u03b5 and this gives global existence and the dissipative estimate for V\u03b5 (t) if\n\u03b5 = \u03b5(u0 , g) is small enough. However, this is still not enough to deduce the dissipative estimate\nfor u(t) since the parameter \u03b5 still depends on the initial data u0 . To overcome this difficulty,\nwe will consider the time-dependent parameter \u03b5 = \u03b5(t). To be more precise, let \u03c6\u03b5,x0 (x) be the\nsame as in (3.6). Then, due to (2.5), we have\n(5.3)\n\n|\u2202t \u03c6\u03b5,x0 (x)| \u2264 Ct [\u03c6\u03b5,x0 (x)], Ct := 5 *\n\n|\u03b5\u2032 (t)|\n.\n\u03b5(t)\n\nWe multiply equation (5.1) by \u03c6\u03b5 \u03bc = \u03c6\u03b5(t),x0 \u03bc, where the function \u03b5(t) will be specified below,\nand integrate over x. Then, analogously to (3.7), we get\n\u0013\n\u0012\nd\n1\n2\n(5.4)\n(F (u), \u03c6\u03b5 ) + (|\u2207x u| , \u03c6\u03b5 ) + (g, \u03c6\u03b5 u) + (|\u2207x \u03bc|2 , \u03c6\u03b5 ) =\ndt\n2\n1\n= (|\u03bc|2 , \u2206x \u03c6\u03b5 ) + (\u2207x \u03bc, \u2207x (\u2207x \u03c6\u03b5 * \u2207x u))\u2212\n2\n1\n\u2212 \u03bb(\u03c6\u03b5 , |\u2207u|2 + f (u)u + gu) + (\u2202t \u03c6\u03b5 , F (u) + |\u2207u|2 + gu),\n2\nwhere the extra two terms in the right-hand side are due to the extra term \u03bbu and the dependence\nof \u03c6\u03b5 on time. Note that the assumptions (3.4) imply that\nF (u) \u2264 f (u)u + C\nfor some constant C and, therefore,\n\u2212\u03bb(\u03c6\u03b5 , |\u2207u|2 + f (u)u + gu) \u2264 \u2212\u03bbE\u03c6\u03b5 (t) + C\u03b5\u22123 (1 + kgk2L6 ),\nb\n\nwhere E\u03c6\u03b5 (t) is defined by (3.15). Furthermore, using (5.3) together with (3.16), we have\n1\n(\u2202t \u03c6\u03b5 , F (u) + |\u2207u|2 + gu) \u2264 2Ct E\u03c6\u03b5 + C(Ct + 1)\u03b5\u22123 (1 + kgk2L6 ).\nb\n2\nThus, the extra terms are estimated as follows\n1\n(5.5) \u2212 \u03bb(\u03c6\u03b5 , |\u2207u|2 + f (u)u+ gu)+ (\u2202t \u03c6\u03b5 , F (u)+ |\u2207u|2 + gu) \u2264 \u2212\u03bb/2E\u03c6\u03b5 (t)+ C\u03b5\u22121 (1+ kgk2L6 )\nb\n2\nif the parameter \u03b5(t) satisfies the following extra condition:\n(5.6)\n\nCt = 5\n\n\u03bb\n|\u03b5\u2032 (t)|\n\u2264\n\u03b5(t)\n2\n\nwhich is assumed to be satisfied from now on. The rest of the terms in (5.4) can be estimated\nusing Lemmas 3.2 and 3.3 exactly as in the proof of Theorem 3.1 which gives the following\ndissipative analogue of (3.21):\n(5.7)\n\n\u03bb\nd\nE\u03c6\u03b5 (t) + E\u03c6\u03b5 (t) + \u03b2k\u2207x \u03bck2L2 \u2264 C\u03b52 E\u03c6\u03b5 (t) + C\u03b55 [E\u03c6\u03b5 (t)]2 + C\u03b5\u22123 (kgk2L6 + 1).\nb\n\u03c6\u03b5\ndt\n2\n\nLeaving (3.22) unchanged and again using that \u03b52 y \u2264 \u03b55 y 2 + \u03b5\u22121 , we see that the function\nV\u03b5 (t) := \u03b53 E\u03c6\u03b5 (t) solves the dissipative analogue of inequality (3.23):\nd\n\u03bb\nV\u03b5 + V\u03b5 + \u03b2\u03b53 k\u2207x \u03bck2L2 \u2264 \u03b52 V\u03b52 + C(kgk2L6 + 1), V\u03b5 (0) \u2264 C(1 + kgk2L6 + ku0 k\u03a6b ) := V0 ,\nb\nb\n\u03c6\u03b5\ndt\n2\nwhere the constant C is independent of \u03b5 and ku0 k\u03a6b is defined by (3.24).\n\n(5.8)\n\n\f13\n\nWe claim that inequality (5.8) is enough to deduce the desired dissipative estimate (5.2) and\nfinish the proof of the theorem.

Let the assumptions of Theorem 5.1 hold and, in addition, (4.1) be satisfied.\nThen the solution u(t) constructed in Theorem 5.1 is unique and, for every two solutions u1 (t)\nand u2 (t) of the Cahn-Hilliard-Oono equation, estimate (4.2) holds.\nIndeed, the presence of the extra term \u03bbu in (5.1) does not make any essential difference for\nthe uniqueness proof which repeats almost word by word the proof of Theorem 4.1 and by this\nreason is omitted.\nThe following corollary is the dissipative analogue of Corollary 4.2.\n\n\f14\n\nCorollary 5.3. Let the assumptions of Proposition 5.2 hold and let, in addition, the initial data\nu0 be such that \u2202t u(0) \u2208 Wb\u22121,2 (R3 ). Then, \u2202t u(t) \u2208 Wb\u22121,2 (R3 ) for all t > 0 and the analogue\nof dissipative estimate (5.2) is valid:\n(5.17)\n\nk\u2202t u(t)kW \u22121,2 \u2264 Q(k\u2202t u(0)kW \u22121,2 + ku(0)k\u03a6b )e\u2212\u03b3t + Q(kgkL6 )\nb\n\nb\n\nb\n\nfor proper monotone function Q and positive constant \u03b3. Moreover, if \u2202t u(0) \u2208\n/ Wb\u22121,2 (R3 ) then,\nnevertheless, \u2202t u(t) \u2208 Wb\u22121,2 (R3 ) and the following estimate holds:\n(5.18)\n\nk\u2202t u(t)kW \u22121,2 \u2264 Ct\u22121/2 Q(ku(0)k\u03a6b + kgkL6 ), t \u2208 (0, 1]\nb\n\nb\n\nfor some monotone increasing function Q and positive C.\nProof. Indeed, arguing exactly as in Corollary 4.2, we end up with estimate\nd\nk\u2202t u(t)k2\u03c6\u03b5 \u2264 Q(ku(t)k\u03a6b )k\u2202t u(t)k2L2\u03c6 ,\n(5.19)\n\u03b5\ndt\n8\nwhere Q(z) = C(1 + z) , see (4.9) and (4.10). Multiplying this inequality by t and integrating\nin time, we get\nZ t\n2\ndt, t \u2208 (0, 1].\nk\u2207x \u03bc(t)k2L2\u03c6\ntk\u2202t u(t)kW \u22121,2 \u2264 (Q(ku(t)k\u03a6b ) + 1)\n\u03c6\u03b5,x0\n\n\u03b5,x0\n\n0\n\nTaking the supremum over all shifts x0 \u2208 R3 and using (2.8) together with (5.2), we have\nk\u2202t u(t)k2W \u22121,2 \u2264 t\u22121 Q(ku(0)k\u03a6b + kgkL6 )\nb\n\nb\n\nfor some new monotone function Q. Thus, (5.18) is verified. In addition, the last estimate gives\nthat\nk\u2202t u(t + 1)kW \u22121,2 \u2264 Q(ku(t)kW \u22121,2 + kgkL6 )\nb\n\nb\n\nb\n\nwhich together with (5.2) proves also the dissipative estimate (5.17) for t \u2265 1. Finally, estimate\n(5.17) on the finite time interval t \u2208 [0, 1] follows directly from the Gronwall inequality applied\nto (5.19) and the corollary is proved.\n\u0003\nFurthermore, the dissipative analogue of Corollary 4.3 also holds.\nCorollary 5.4. Let the assumptions of Proposition 5.2 hold and let, in addition u0 \u2208 Wb2,6 (R3 ).\nThen, u(t) \u2208 Wb2,6 (R3 ) for all t > 0 and the analogue of (5.17) holds. If u0 \u2208\n/ Wb2,6 (R3 ) then,\nnevertheless, u(t) \u2208 Wb2,6 (R3 ) for all t > 0 and the analog of smoothing property (5.18) also\nholds.\nRemark 5.5. As we have noted in Remark 4.4, the verified W 2,6 -regularity of solutions allows\nus to obtain further smoothness of solutions (restricted only by the regularity of g and f ) by\nstandard bootstrapping arguments. In the case of the Cahn-Hilliard-Oono equation, the obtained\nestimates for the higher norms will be also dissipative.\nNote also that the proved dissipative estimate (5.2) together with the smoothing properties\nestablished in Corollaries 5.3 and 5.4 allow us to define the dissipative solution semigroup in the\nphase space \u03a6b\n(5.20)\n\nS(t) : \u03a6b \u2192 \u03a6b , S(t)u0 = u(t), \u03a6b := {u0 \u2208 Wb1,2 (R3 ), F (u0 ) \u2208 L1b (R3 )}\n\nand verify that this semigroup possesses and absorbing set bounded in Wb2,6 (R3 ). This, together\nwith the Lipschitz continuity (4.2) allows us, in turn, to establish the existence of the so-called\nlocally compact global attractor A \u2282 Wb2,6 (R3 ) (see [25] for more details) for the solution\nsemigroup (5.20) associated with the Cahn-Hilliard-Oono equation. After that one can also\nstudy the upper and lower bounds for its Kolmogorov's \u03b5-entropy, etc. Since all these things are\n\n\f15\n\nmore or less straightforward nowadays (when the key dissipative estimate is obtained, of course,\nsee [2, 3, 25, 33, 37, 35, 36, 38] and references therein), we prefer not to give more details here.\n6. Cahn-Hilliard equation with singular potentials\nIn the previous sections, we have considered the case when the nonlinearity is regular f \u2208\nC 2 (R). In this section, we briefly consider the case of the so-called singular potentials where the\nnonlinearity f is defined on the interval (\u22121, 1) only and has singularities at u = \u00b11, a situation\nwhich is currently of great interest, see [9, 13, 17] and references therein. The typical example\nhere is the so-called logarithmic potential\n1\u2212u\n\u2212 \u03b1u\n(6.1)\nf (u) = log\n1+u\nor the polynomial singularity\nu\n\u2212 \u03b1u,\n(6.2)\nf (u) =\n(1 \u2212 u2 )l\nwhere l > 0.\nIn this case, it is additionally assumed that the solution u(t, x) is always inbetween minus and\nplus one:\n(6.3)\n\n\u2212 1 < u(t, x) < 1 for almost all (t, x) \u2208 R+ \u00d7 R3\n\nand therefore f (u(t, x)) has a sense.\nFollowing [13] (see also [9, 10, 27] and references therein), we assume that the nonlinearity f\nsatisfies\n\uf8f1\n2\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f21. f \u2208 C (\u22121, 1), f (0) = 0;\n(6.4)\n2. limu\u00b1\u221e f (u) = \u00b1\u221e;\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\n3. limu\u00b1\u221e f \u2032 (u) = +\u221e\n\nand, exactly as in the case of regular potentials, we assume that g \u2208 L6b (R3 ).\nHowever, in contrast to the case of bounded or cylindrical domains, assumptions (6.4) look\ninsufficient to derive the key a priori estimate (at least using the method developed above).\nIndeed, the third assumption of (3.2) which connects the growth rate of f (u) and its antiderivative F (u) has been essential in the derivation of that estimate. But this assumption is clearly\nwrong for the case of singular potentials where f (u) is growing faster than F (u) as u \u2192 \u00b11.\nIn particular, for the case of nonlinearity (6.1) as well as nonlinearity (6.2) with l < 1, the\npotential F (u) is bounded near u = \u00b11, so f (u) cannot be reasonably estimated through F (u)\nnear the singularities and, by this reason, we are unable to treat these cases. But if l > 1, the\nnonlinearity (6.2) obviously satisfies\n(6.5)\n\n|f (u)| \u2264 \u03b2|F (u)|\u03ba + C\n\n1\n). As shown in\nfor some positive \u03b2 and C and some \u03ba \u2208 (1, \u221e) (for (6.2), we have \u03ba = 1 + l\u22121\nthe next theorem this assumption is enough in order to obtain the analogues of theorems 3.1\nand 5.1 for the case of singular potentials.\n\nTheorem 6.1. Let the assumptions (6.4) and (6.5) hold and g \u2208 L6b (R3 ). Then, for every\nu0 \u2208 \u03a6b , the Cahn-Hilliard equation (3.1) possesses at least one global solution u(t), t \u2265 0,\n(in the sense of (3.4) plus the extra assumption (6.3)) which satisfies the following analogue of\n(3.29):\n(6.6) ku(t)k2W 1,2 + kF (u(t))kL1 + k\u2207x \u03bck2L2 ([0,t]\u00d7R3 ) \u2264\nb\nb\nb\n\u00113\u03ba\u22121/2\n\u0010\n,\n\u2264 C(1 + t3\u03ba+1 ) 1 + kgk2L6 + ku0 k2W 1,2 + kF (u0 )kL1\nb\n\nb\n\nb\n\n\f16\n\nwhere \u03ba is the same as in assumption (6.5).\nProof. As in the proof of Theorem 3.1, we restrict ourselves to the formal derivation of the\nkey estimate (6.6) and the existence of a solution can be then obtained in a standard way, see\n[15, 25]. The derivation of this estimate is also similar to what we have done in the proof of\nTheorem 3.2, however, the weight function (3.6) is no longer appropriate and we should use\nmore general weights \u03c6\u03b5 (x) defined in (2.2) with the parameter\n\u03b3 =3+\n\n2\n,\n2\u03ba \u2212 1\n\nwhere \u03ba is the same as in assumption (6.5).\nIndeed, multiplying equation (3.1) by \u03c6\u03b5 \u03bc = \u03c6\u03b5,x0 (x)\u03bc(t) where \u03c6\u03b5,x0 (x) = \u03c6\u03b5 (x \u2212 x0 ) and\n\u03c6\u03b5 is defined by (2.2) (with the parameters \u03b5 being specified below), and arguing exactly as in\nthe proof of Theorem 3.1 (as it is not difficult to see, Lemmas 3.2 and 3.3 remain true for the\nsingular potentials, so no difference so far), we obtain the following analogue of estimate (3.19):\n(6.7)\n\n\u0011\n\u0010\n1\nd\nE\u03c6\u03b5 (t) + \u03b2 (|\u2207x \u03bc|2 , \u03c6\u03b5 ) + k\u2207x (\u03c6\u03b51/2 \u03bc)k2L2 + (\u03c63\u03b5 , |f (u)|6 ) 3 \u2264\ndt\n\u2264 C\u03b52 (\u03c6\u03b5 , |\u2207x u|2 ) + 1) + C\u03b52 (\u03c61+2/\u03b3\n, |f (u)|2 ) + C\u03b5\u22123 (kgk6L6 + 1),\n\u03b5\nb\n\nwhere the weighted energy E\u03c6\u03b5 is defined by (3.15) and satisfies (3.16) (the exponent 7/5 in the\nsecond term of the right-hand side of (3.19) is now replaced by 1 + 2/\u03b3 due to the choice of a\ndifferent weight function, see (2.4)).\nHowever, in order to estimate the second term in the right-hand side of (6.7), we now need\n1/\u03ba\nto modify (3.20) interpolating between L\u03c6\u03b5 and L6\u03c63 (instead of L1\u03c6\u03b5 and L6\u03c63 ). Namely, using\n\u03b5\n\u03b5\nthe elementary fact that\n2\n4\u03ba\n2\u03ba \u2212 1\n1+ =\n+3*\n\u03b3\n6\u03ba \u2212 1\n6\u03ba \u2212 1\ntogether with the H\u00f6lder and Young inequalities, we see that\n2\u03ba\u22121\n\n4\u03ba\n\n(6.8) C\u03b52 (\u03c61+2/\u03b3\n, |f (u)|2 ) = C\u03b52 ([\u03c6\u03b5 |f (u)|1/\u03ba ] 6\u03ba\u22121 , [\u03c63\u03b5 |f (u)|6 ] 6\u03ba\u22121 ) \u2264\n\u03b5\n1\n\n2\u03ba\u22121\n\n4\u03ba\n\n\u2264 C\u03b52 (\u03c6\u03b5 , |f (u)| \u03ba ) 6\u03ba\u22121 (\u03c63\u03b5 , |f (u)|6 ) 6\u03ba\u22121 =\n\u0011 2 \u0010\n\u0010\n\u0011 6\u03ba\u22123\n1\n6\u03ba\u22121\n6\u03ba\u22121\n= C \u03b56\u03ba\u22121 (\u03c6\u03b5 , |f (u)| \u03ba )2\u03ba\n(\u03c63\u03b5 , |f (u)|6 )1/3\n\u2264\n\n\u2264 C\u03b56\u03ba\u22121 (\u03c6\u03b5 , |f (u)|1/\u03ba )2\u03ba + \u03b2(\u03c63\u03b5 , |f (u)|6 )1/3 .\n\nInserting this estimate into the right-hand side of (6.7) and using (6.5) and (3.16), we arrive at\nthe following analogue of inequality (3.21)\n(6.9)\n\nd\nE\u03c6 (t) + \u03b2k\u2207x \u03bck2L2 \u2264 C\u03b52 E\u03c6\u03b5 (t) + C\u03b56\u03ba\u22121 [E\u03c6\u03b5 (t)]2\u03ba + C\u03b5\u22123 (kgk2L6 + 1).\nb\n\u03c6\u03b5\ndt \u03b5\n\nAs in the proof of Theorem 3.1, this inequality implies the desired estimate (6.6). Indeed,\nintroducing V\u03b5 (t) := E\u03c6\u03b5 (t) and eliminating the first term in the right-hand side via the Young\ninequality, we end up with\nd\nV\u03b5 + \u03b2\u03b53 k\u2207x \u03bck2L2 \u2264 \u03b52 V\u03b52\u03ba + C(kgk2L6 + 1), V\u03b5 (0) \u2264 C(1 + kgk2L6 + ku0 k\u03a6b ).\nb\nb\n\u03c6\u03b5\ndt\nAs in the proof of Theorem 3.1, we conclude that\n(6.10)\n\nV\u03b5 (t) \u2264 2C(T + 1)(1 + kgk2L6 + ku0 k\u03a6b ), t \u2208 [0, T ]\nb\n\n\f17\n\nif \u03b5 = \u03b5(T, u0 , g) is fixed by\n(6.11)\n\n\u03b5 :=\n\n[2(T +\n\n1)]\u03ba [C(1\n\n1\n.\n+ kgk2L6 + ku0 k\u03a6b )]\u03ba\u22121/2\nb\n\nThus,\nE\u03c6\u03b5,x0 (T ) \u2264 \u03b5\u22123 V\u03b5 (T ) \u2264 C(T + 1)3\u03ba+1 (1 + kgk2L6 + ku0 k\u03a6b )3\u03ba\u22121/2\nb\n\nand the desired estimate (6.6) follows now by applying the supremum over x0 \u2208 R3 and using\n(2.8). Theorem 6.1 is proved.\n\u0003\nThe next theorem gives the analogue of Theorem 6.1 for the Cahn-Hilliard-Oono equation\nwith singular potentials.\nTheorem 6.2. Let the assumptions (6.4) and (6.5) hold and g \u2208 L6b (R3 ). Then, for every\nu0 \u2208 \u03a6b , the Cahn-Hilliard-Oono equation (5.1) possesses at least one global solution u(t), t \u2265 0,\n(in the sense of (3.4) plus the extra assumption (6.3)) which satisfies the following analogue of\n(3.29):\n(6.12)\n\nku(t)k2W 1,2 + kF (u(t))kL1 + k\u2207x \u03bck2L2 ([t,t+1]\u00d7R3 ) \u2264 Q(ku0 k\u03a6b )e\u2212\u03c3t + Q(kgkL6 ),\nb\n\nb\n\nb\n\nb\n\nwhere the monotone increasing function Q and positive constant \u03c3 are independent of u0 and t.\nThe proof of this theorem repeats almost word by word the proof of Theorem 5.1. The only\n2\ninstead of \u03b3 = 5 in the definition of the weight\ndifference is that we should use \u03b3 = 3 + 2\u03ba\u22121\nfunction \u03c6\u03b5(t) (x) and use the refined interpolation inequality (6.8) instead of (3.20). For this\nreason, we do not present it here.\nRemark 6.3. The uniqueness Theorem 4.1 can be also extended to the singular case. However,\nthis requires to control the derivative f \u2032 (u) through f (u) or F (u) and assumptions (4.1) are\nagain not compatible with singular potentials and must be modified. For instance, if we assume\nthat\n(6.13)\n\n|f \u2032 (u)| \u2264 [\u03a8(u)]\u03ba1 , \u03a8(u) \u2264 C1 f (u) + C2 , \u03ba1 < 8/5\n\nfor some convex function \u03a8 and positive C1 and C2 , then arguing as in [13] (see Theorem 3.4), we\nmay establish the uniqueness as well as the further regularity of a solution and verify, in particular, that the solution u becomes separated from singularities for positive times (ku(t)kL\u221e \u2264 1\u2212\u03b4,\nfor some \u03b4 > 0). After that the further investigation of the problem can be constructed exactly\nas for the case of regular potentials.\nNote also that condition (6.13) is stronger than (6.5) which we need for the global existence\nof a solution. In particular, for the nonlinearities (6.2), we need k > 5/3 (instead of k > 1).\nReferences\n[1] F.
