The electric current\nflows within the gap between the cylinders is axial direction. For given Reynolds number of rotation the magnetic Prandtl\nnumber Pm of the liquid conductor and the ratio of the cylinder's rotation rates are the free parameters. It is shown that\nfor resting cylinders the critical Hartmann number for the unstable modes does not depend on Pm. By rigid rotation the\ninstability is suppressed where the critical ratio of the rotation velocity and the Alfv\u00e9n velocity of the field (only) slightly\ndepends on Pm. For Pm = 1 the rotational quenching of TI takes its maximum.\nOne also finds that rotation laws with negative shear (i.e. d\u03a9 /dR < 0) strongly destabilize the toroidal field if the rotation\nis not too fast. In radiative zones of young stars, galaxies and in the fluid crust of neutron stars this effect could have\ndrastic implications. For sufficiently high Reynolds numbers of rotation the suppression of the nonaxisymmetric magnetic\ninstability always dominates. Superrotation laws support the rotational stabilization but only for not too high Pm.\nThe angular momentum transport of the instability is anticorrelated with the shear so that an eddy viscosity can be defined\nwhich proves to be positive. For negative shear the Maxwell stress of the perturbations remarkably contributes to the angular momentum transport.\nWe have also shown the possibility of laboratory TI experiments with a wide-gap container filled with fluid metals like\nsodium or gallium. Even the effect of the rotational stabilization can be reproduced in the laboratory with electric currents\nof only a few kAmp.\nc 2009 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim\n\n1 Motivation\nA known instability of toroidal fields is the current-driven\n('kink-type') Tayler instability (TI) which is basically nonaxisymmetric (Tayler 1957; Vandakurov 1972; Tayler 1973;\nAcheson 1978). The toroidal field becomes unstable against\nnonaxisymmetric perturbations for a sufficiently large magnetic field amplitude depending on the radial profile of the\nfield. A global rigid rotation of the system stabilizes the\nTI, i.e. much higher field amplitudes can be kept stable.\nFor the rapidly rotating regime \u03a9 2 > \u03a9A2 (with \u03a9A is the\nAlfv\u00e9n frequency of the toroidal field) the stability becomes\ncomplete, i.e. all possible modes in incompressible fluids of\nuniform density are stable (Pitts & Tayler 1985). We shall\ndemonstrate in the present paper how this instability and its\nstabilization by rigid rotation can experimentally be realized\nwith fluid conductors like sodium and gallium. There is so\nfar no empirical or observational proof of the existence of\nthe TI (Maeder & Meynet 2005).\nAnother important topic in this respect is the stability\nof rotation laws with d\u03a9 /dR < 0 ('subrotation'). It is\nknown that they become centrifugally unstable in the hydrodynamic regime if they are steep enough to fulfill the\nRayleigh criterion (d(R2 \u03a9 )/dR < 0). This linear insta\u22c6 Corresponding author: gruediger@aip.de\n\nbility is basically axisymmetric. However, for magnetized\nideal fluids under rapid rotation, Acheson (1978) even finds\ninstability of the nonaxisymmetric mode with m = 1 if the\nshear flow is 'superAlfv\u00e9nic', i.e.\nd\u03a9 2\n> \u03a9A2 .\n(1)\ndR\nHence, a nonaxisymmetric MHD instability exists even for\nrather flat rotation laws if a weak toroidal magnetic field is\npresent (despite of the rapid-rotation condition \u03a9 2 > \u03a9A2 ).\nOf course, relation (1) has no own meaning for vanishing\nmagnetic fields. One can also say that Eq. (1) describes a\ndestabilizing role of the differential rotation with d\u03a9 /dR <\n0. The system of flow and field becomes unstable although\nthe differential rotation alone would be stable and also the\nmagnetic field alone would be stable.\nIt is, of course, important to know whether this result is\nmodified for real fluids with finite values of viscosity and\nmagnetic diffusivity. We shall show that indeed an extreme\ndestabilization of magnetic fields by weak subrotation exists for moderately rapid rotation. More important, however,\nis the behavior of this nonaxisymmetric instability for very\nfast rotation as the latter tends to destroy nonaxisymmetric\nmagnetic patterns. We shall find that it indeed disappears\nfor too fast rotation. The astrophysical consequences for the\nstability of toroidal magnetic fields in differentially rotating\n\u2212R\n\nc 2009 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim\n\n\f2\n\nG. R\u00fcdiger & M. Schultz: Tayler instability of toroidal magnetic fields\n\nstellar radiative zones and in the fluid crust of high-spinning\nneutron stars might be very strong.\nImportant is also the existence of a nonaxisymmetric\ninstability for flat subrotation laws even for current-free\ntoroidal fields (B\u03c6 \u221d 1/R) which we have called azimuthal magnetorotational instability (AMRI, see R\u00fcdiger\net al. 2007a). It appears if the shear becomes superAlfv\u00e9nic, i.e. the magnetic Reynolds number exceeds the\n(high enough) Lundquist number of the toroidal field. For\ntoo high Reynolds numbers, however, also this effect disappears. Nonuniform rotation always tends to suppress any\nnonaxisymmetric magnetic mode. The same phenomenon\ncan be observed for the nonaxisymmetric modes of TI.\nAnother new question arises about the role of 'superrotation' (i.e. d\u03a9 /dR > 0) which is always stable in the\nhydrodynamic regime. One can expect that toroidal fields\nsubject to superrotation may be stabilized. Then it should\nalso be true that for solar low latitudes, where in the bulk\nof the convection zone the equatorial \u03a9 increases outwards,\nthe toroidal field is stabilized and can be amplified to much\nhigher values than it would be possible for the opposite\nrotation law. Note that the sunspots with their rather high\nmagnetic field strength appear in the same area as the superrotation does. An open question is whether a rotation\nlaw with negative shear destabilizes the field so that it cannot reach high amplitudes. In the present paper it is shown\nwith a simplifying cylinder geometry that indeed for not\ntoo large magnetic Prandtl numbers superrotation stabilizes\ntoroidal magnetic fields while subrotation strongly destabilizes toroidal magnetic fields in case that the rotation is not\ntoo fast. The stabilization by superrotation, however, vanishes for large magnetic Prandtl number.\nIn the shearing-sheet box approximation Tagger, Pellat & Coroniti (1992) already considered nonaxisymmetric\nmodes for vertical fields and also for azimuthal fields (Balbus & Hawley 1992). Except by the already mentioned authors, the stability problem of a system of toroidal fields\nand differential rotation has been studied in cylindric geometry several times (Michael 1954; Chandrasekhar 1961;\nHoward & Gupta 1962; Chanmugam 1979; Knobloch 1992:\nDubrulle & Knobloch 1993; Kumar, Coleman & Kley 1994;\nPessah & Psaltis 2005; Shalybkov 2006) but in all these\nstudies only axisymmetric perturbations are considered. In\nideal MHD also nonaxisymmetric modes have been studied for current-free toroidal fields (Ogilvie & Pringle 1996).\nHere as a continuation of papers by R\u00fcdiger et al. (2007a,b)\nattention is focused to the nonaxisymmetric perturbation\nmodes with m = 1 for real fluids. In particular, the possible realizations of the instabilities as experiments in the\n(MHD-)laboratory are discussed.\n\n2 The Taylor-Couette geometry\nA Taylor-Couette container is considered confining a\ntoroidal magnetic field of given amplitudes at the cylinders\nwhich rotate with different rotation rates \u03a9 (see Fig. 1).

The wave number is varied as long as for given Hartmann number the Reynolds number takes its minimum.\nThe procedure is already described in detail by Shalybkov,\nR\u00fcdiger & Schultz (2002). One immediately finds that the\nsign of the real wave number k is free so that with the solution for k also another one with \u2212k exists. For containers\nbounded in z standing waves can thus develop.\nFor insulating walls the boundary conditions are more\ncomplicated (see R\u00fcdiger et al. 2007b).\nThe necessary and sufficient condition for the stability\nof toroidal fields in ideal Taylor-Couette flows against axisymmetric perturbations is by Michael (1954) and reads\n\u0012\n\u00132\nB\u03c6\nR d\n1 d\n2\n2\n(R \u03a9) \u2212\n> 0.\n(19)\nR3 dR\n\u03bc0 \u03c1 dR R\nFields which are not steeper than B\u03c6 \u221d R are thus always\nstable against m = 0 perturbations if the rotation law is\nalso stable.

The same is true for nearly\nuniform fields with \u03bcB \u2243 1. A general criterion for rotating\nflows does not exist.\nFirst the system (15) is used to demonstrate that for resting cylinders the Hacrit does not depend on the magnetic\nPrandtl number Pm. To this end in the equations all terms\nresulting from the rotational influence are canceled. The frequency \u03c9 is replaced by \u03c9/Re.

Hence, in the real part of the system (21) the frequency terms including the Pm do not appear. The only free\nparameter in the real part of the system (21), therefore, is\nthe critical Hartmann number which results thus as equal\nfor all Pm. Shalybkov (2006) has given a similar result but\nonly for m = 0.\n\nFig. 2 The critical Hartmann number for \u03a9 = 0 for various container gaps (\u03b7\u0302) between conducting cylinders. The\nnumbers are valid for all magnetic Prandtl numbers, see\ntext.\n\nThe Hartmann numbers Hacrit for various \u03b7\u0302 are given\nin Fig. 2. They vary over many orders of magnitude and\nbecome very small for wide gaps (\u03b7\u0302 \u2192 0). For small \u03b7\u0302 the\ncritical Hartmann number vanishes like\nHacrit \u221d \u03b7\u0302 1.5\n\n(22)\n\nwith a factor of about 25. Our calculation with the smallest\nRin concern \u03b7\u0302 = 0.001 and lead to Ha = 0.00075.\nIn the present paper the gap between the cylinders is assumed as narrow (\u03b7\u0302 = 0.95) and in another computation as\nwide (\u03b7\u0302 = 0.05) so that the unit of distances, D, is the same\nin both cases for fixed outer radius. The narrow gap model\nserves to astrophysical discussions (solar tachocline, neutron star crust, supergranulation layer) while the wide gap\nresults are needed to prepare future laboratory experiments.\nWe have shown with similar models that indeed wide gaps\nare much more suitable for TI experiments with liquid metals like sodium or gallium than narrow gaps (R\u00fcdiger et al.\n2007b).\n\nwww.an-journal.org\n\n\fAstron. Nachr. / AN (2009)\n\n5\n\n4 Narrow gap\nFor \u03b7\u0302 = 0.95 it is \u03bcB = 1.05. The critical Hartmann number for Re = 0 is 3061 for all Pm (see Fig. 2). The Rayleigh\nlimit for centrifugal instability is \u03bc\u03a9 = \u03b7\u0302 2 = 0.9025.\n4.1 Rigid rotation\nWe start with the simplest case of the interaction of toroidal\nfield and global rotation, i.e. with the marginal instability\nfor rigid rotation (\u03bc\u03a9 = 1).\n\nFig. 3 Narrow gap (\u03b7\u0302 = 0.95): The suppression of the\nTI by rigid rotation. The curves are marked with their magnetic Prandtl number Pm. The rotational suppression of TI\nis weaker for Pm 6= 1 than for Pm = 1. Rotating fluids\nwith Pm = 1 allow the strongest fields to be stable.\nThe results of the calculations are shown in Fig. 3 in the\nplane Rem-Ha. As we already know the critical Hartmann\nnumber Ha for Rem = 0 does not depend on the magnetic\nPrandtl number. The new result is that the critical Ha always\ngrows for growing rotation rate. This is the stabilizing action\nof rotation. In the representation of Fig. 3 (where the parameters on both axes are symmetric in \u03bd and \u03b7) the growth of\nthe critical magnetic amplitudes is strongest for Pm = 1\nbut it becomes weaker for Pm 6= 1. For Rem <\n\u223c 500 the differences of the critical magnetic fields for Pm varying over\nthree orders of magnitude are surprisingly small.\nFor higher values of Rem the curves seem to represent a\nlinear relation between Rem and Ha. Note that in Fig. 3 the\nmagnetic Mach number\nMm =\n\n\u03a9D\n\u221a\nBin / \u03bc0 \u03c1\n\nMm \u2243\n\n3 * 1014 Gauss\n,\nB\u03c6\n\n(24)\n\nso that B\u03c6 \u2243 3 * 1014 Gauss is the critical value for the\ntoroidal field. We have here used the numerical values \u03a9 =\n100 s\u22121 , \u03c1 \u2243 1013 g/cm3 and H \u2243 3 * 105 cm.\nThe same data are plotted in Fig. 4 in the Rm-S plane.\nAgain the curves are marked with their magnetic Prandtl\nnumbers. One can read this plot in the sense that rotation,\nmagnetic field and magnetic diffusivity \u03b7 are given and the\nviscosity (in units of \u03b7) is varied. For high viscosity the\nfields must be much stronger to become unstable. One finds\na distinct stabilizing influence of the viscosity. The rotational influence, however, is weaker for high viscosity.\nThe results are applied to the bottom of the convection\nzone. The theory of the advection-dominated dynamo requires the small value of 1011 cm2 /s for the eddy diffusivity \u03b7 while the eddy viscosity \u03bd should be larger for\nthe explanation of the differential rotation pattern so that\nPm \u2265 10. With \u03a9 \u2243 2 * 10\u22126 s\u22121 and D \u2243 1010 cm we\nfind Rm \u2243 2000. Figure 4 yields S \u2264 104 for stability. With\n\u03c1 \u2243 0.1 g/cm3 the upper limit for stable toroidal fields becomes 100 kGauss. Stronger fields will not be stable against\nthe Tayler instability. This value does not grow if the nonuniformity of the rotation (i.e. superrotation) is included due\nto the high value of Pm (see below).\n\nFig. 4 The same as in Fig. 3 but for fixed magnetic diffusivity \u03b7 and varied viscosity. High viscosity stabilizes the\nmagnetic fields and reduces the rotational influence.\n\n(23)\n\nis the smallest for Pm = 1. If this behavior remained\ntrue also for much higher Ha then the consequences should\nbe strong: In turbulent fluids and/or in simulations with\nPm = 1 rather strong magnetic fields remain stable which\nfor the real Pm 6= 1 are already unstable. For small Pm\n(stellar radiative interior) and high Pm (galaxies, neutron\n\nwww.an-journal.org\n\nstars) the magnetic instability is much more efficient and\nalready works for much smaller magnetic field strengths.\nFor neutron stars the ratio (23) yields\n\n4.2 Nonuniform rotation\nThe form of the rotation law is now changed for various magnetic Prandtl numbers. Rotation laws with negative\nshear (here \u03bc\u03a9 = 0.5 and \u03bc\u03a9 = 0.92) and superrotation\nlaws (here \u03bc\u03a9 = 1.07) are investigated. The rotation law\nc 2009 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim\n\n\f6\n\nG. R\u00fcdiger & M. Schultz: Tayler instability of toroidal magnetic fields\n\nwith \u03bc\u03a9 = 0.5 is centrifugally unstable also without magnetic field. It is given only for demonstration. The remaining rotation laws are stable in the hydrodynamic regime.\nOne finds the numerical results for marginal stability of the\nm = 1 mode in Fig. 5. Superrotation stabilizes the field\nmore than solid-body rotation. For subrotation the behavior is opposite. While for rigid rotation and superrotation\nthe critical Hartmann numbers grow for growing Reynolds\nnumber Rem, for subrotation the Ha become smaller so that\nfinally the shear becomes superAlfv\u00e9nic. This effect is in\naccordance with the Acheson relation (1).\n\nFig. 6 The same as in Fig. 5 for \u03bc\u03a9 = 0.92 but for much\nhigher Reynolds numbers. The rotational destabilization\ndoes only hold for medium Reynolds numbers. For faster\nrotation the rotational stabilization dominates. Pm = 1.\n\nFig. 5 Reynolds number vs. Hartmann number of the TI\nfor subrotation (\u03bc\u03a9 = 0.5, \u03bc\u03a9 = 0.92), rigid rotation\n(\u03bc\u03a9 = 1) and superrotation (\u03bc\u03a9 = 1.07). Note the rotational quenching for \u03bc\u03a9 = 1, the strong destabilization by\nsubrotation and the stabilization by superrotation. Conducting cylinder walls, \u03b7\u0302 = 0.95, Pm = 1.\n\nThis finding, however, cannot be the final answer. Very\nintensive differential rotation always tends to suppress nonaxisymmetric magnetic patterns. We therefore expect that\nfor higher Reynolds numbers the Eq. (1) looses its meaning. In Fig. 6 the marginal-instability curve for \u03bc\u03a9 = 0.92\nis thus followed to very high values of the Reynolds number. The result of the calculations is that also for subrotation the basic rotation finally suppresses the instability if\nRem >\n\u223c 3000.\nUp to this value the differential rotation acts destabilizing. In regions of convection zones with d\u03a9 /dR < 0 much\nweaker toroidal fields become unstable than for d\u03a9 /dR >\n0. This finding should have strong implications for the electrodynamics of rotating stars. Young stars typically rotate\nten times faster then old stars such as the Sun. For the supergranulation part of the solar convection zone the magnetic\nReynolds number does not exceed (say) 300. For younger\nsolar-type stars, however, it can easily reach the value of\n3000. For all Pm and a Reynolds number of order 3000 the\nfield becomes unstable already for very small Ha of order\n100. Hence, the maximum stable toroidal fields in this zone\n\nc 2009 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim\n\nfor which the helioseismology provides a clear subrotation\nis much weaker for fast rotating stars than for the slowrotating Sun. Fast rotators are thus not able to accumulate\nstrong toroidal field which could be observed as starspots\nclose to the equator.\nIn Fig. 5 also the (dashed) curve for \u03bc\u03a9 = 0.5 is given\nfor comparison. Such a rotation law is unstable without\nmagnetic field for m \u2265 0. The magnetic field additionally\ndestabilizes the rotation law so that for Ha = 3061 the TI\nworks even without any rotation.\nThe differences of the results for subrotation and for superrotation only appear for faster rotation but it is until now\nunclear how strong the magnetic fields must be. The calculations for nonuniform rotation laws must be extended\nto smaller and higher magnetic Prandtl numbers. Figure 7\ngives the results for Pm = 0.1 and Pm = 10. They can\nbe best written with the characteristic numbers Rem and Ha\nbecause in this formulation the differences for the small and\nthe large magnetic Prandtl number are smallest. For small\nmagnetic Prandtl number the stabilizing influence of superrotation is stronger than for high magnetic Prandtl numbers.\nNote that for Pm = 10 the stabilization of the magnetic\nfield by superrotation is even smaller than that of rigid rotation. It is not clear whether for even larger magnetic Prandtl\nnumbers rotation laws with positive shear become able to\ndestabilize the magnetic fields.\nWritten with Rem and Ha one finds for given rotation\nlaw with \u03bc\u03a9 \u2243 1 that Pm = 1 yields the most effective\nstabilization of the toroidal magnetic field. For Pm 6= 1 the\nstabilization is stronger for small Pm than for large Pm. The\ndifferences, however, are small. For subrotation (\u03bc\u03a9 < 1)\nthe very effective rotational destabilization of the magnetic\nfield hardly depends on the magnetic Prandtl number.\nIn summary, we have shown for the container with the\nnarrow gap that without rotation the critical Hartmann number is Ha = 3061 independent of the magnetic Prandtl\nwww.an-journal.org\n\n\fAstron. Nachr. / AN (2009)\n\n7\n\nwith positive \u03bdT .\nAfter normalization the expression (25) reads\n\u2032\nTR \u2243 hu\u2032R u\u2032\u03c6 i \u2212 Ha2 PmhBR\nB\u03c6\u2032 i.\n\n(27)\n\nIn\nq Fig. 8 the angular momentum (25) normalized with\n\u20322\nhu\u20322\nR u\u03c6 i is given.

The curves for\nnegative shear (\u03bc\u03a9 = 0.92, subrotation) are red and the\ncurves for positive shear (\u03bc\u03a9 = 1.07, superrotation) are\ngreen. For large Pm superrotation yields less stability than\nrigid rotation.\nnumber. This value is increased for solid-body rotation and\nfor superrotation but it is drastically reduced to about 100\nfor subrotation with Rem \u2265 1000. There is no strong dependence of these characteristic numbers on the magnetic\nPrandtl number. However, for too fast rotation (Rem >\n3500) the destabilization changes to rotational stabilization\n(see Fig. 6). On the other hand, the role of superrotation\nto stabilize the magnetic field changes to destabilization for\ntoo high magnetic Prandtl number.\n4.3 The angular momentum transport\nThe solutions of the linear equations are free of an arbitrary\nreal parameter of any sign. We do not know, therefore, the\nsign of the flow and/or the field. However, for quadratic expressions such as the correlation tensor or the electromotive\nforce one can find the signs as all the solutions are multiplied with one and the same parameter.\nLet us apply this idea to the angular momentum transport\n1\nB \u2032 B \u2032 i.\n(25)\nTR = hu\u2032R u\u2032\u03c6 \u2212\n\u03bc0 \u03c1 R \u03c6\nThe average procedure consists of an integration over the\nazimuth \u03c6.

The\nq values are\n\u20322\nnormalized with the turbulence intensity U = hu\u20322\nR ihu\u03c6 i.\nDue to the Maxwell stress they can exceed unity.\n\nFor simplicity we only work here with Pm = 1. The\nangular momentum transport vanishes for rigid rotation and\nit is indeed anticorrelated with \u2207\u03a9 . The diffusion approximation (26) is thus possible. Its magnetic part is (only) of\nthe same order than its kinetic part.\n\n5 Wide gap\nFor \u03b7\u0302 = 0.05 it is \u03bcB = 1/\u03b7\u0302 = 20. The critical Hartmann number for Re = 0 is 0.31 for all Pm (see Fig. 9).\nThe Rayleigh limit for centrifugal instability is \u03bc\u03a9 = \u03b7\u0302 2 =\n0.0025.\n\nc 2009 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

It is in particular weak for\nvery small Pm.\n\nFig. 10 The same as in Fig. 3 but for \u03b7\u0302 = 0.05. The curves\nare marked with the magnetic Prandtl numbers. Again rotating fluids with Pm = 1 undergo the strongest stabilization.\nFig. 9 The same as in Fig. 2 but for \u03b7\u0302 \u2192 0.

KGaA, Weinheim\n\nThe question is whether also the rotational stabilization\nof the TI can be probed in the laboratory. Therefore, the\nrigidly rotating wide-gap container is considered also for the\nvery small magnetic Prandtl numbers of fluid metals. The\nmagnetic Prandtl number of sodium is about Pm = 10\u22125 ,\nand for gallium it is about Pm = 10\u22126 . Without rotation\nthe critical Hartmann number is 0.31 for this container (independent of Pm). With rotation the numerical results are\ngiven in Fig. 11. We find the rotational stabilization also existing for fluids with their small Pm. For not too fast rotation\nthe differences of the resulting critical Ha are very small for\nboth the fluid conductors so that experiments with gallium\nare also possible. For a (small) Reynolds number of order\n1000 the marginal-stable magnetic field is about two times\nhigher than for Re = 0. It should thus not be too complicated to find the basic effect for the rotational suppression of\nTI \u2013 which proves to be important both for the rapid-rotating\nhot MS stars and also for neutron stars \u2013 in the MHD laboratory.\nThe curves in Fig. 11 do not become more steep for\nPm \u2192 0. There is no visible difference between the curves\nfor Pm = 10\u22126 and Pm = 0.\nwww.an-journal.org\n\n\fAstron. Nachr. / AN (2009)\n\nFig. 11 The suppression of the TI in a wide-gap container\nby rigid rotation for Pm = 10\u22125 and Pm = 10\u22126 . The\nstandard Reynolds number (10) is given for experimental\napplications. \u03b7\u0302 = 0.05, \u03bcB = 20.\n\n6 Conclusions\nIn this paper the interplay of Tayler instability and rotation\nfor incompressible fluids of uniform density filling the gap\nbetween the cylinders of a Taylor-Couette container is considered. The toroidal field is the result of an electric current\nof homogeneous density. It is shown that for zero rotation\nthe critical magnetic field amplitudes for marginal instability does not depend on the magnetic Prandtl number. The\ncritical magnetic field strongly depends on the gap width. It\nis very high for small gaps and it this rather low for wide\ngaps. For small enough inner radius Rin the critical Hart1.5\nmann number (of the inner field) runs as Rin\n. The resulting electric currents necessary for TI with m = 1 are 3.66\nkAmp if the material is the same gallium-tin alloy as used\nin the experiment PROMISE. Such currents can easily be\nproduced in the laboratory.\nFor a narrow gap with \u03b7\u0302 = 0.95 the rotational quenching of the TI is studied in detail. Figure 3 displays the\nrotational stabilization for various magnetic Prandtl numbers. For the normalization of the basic rotation a 'mixed'\nReynolds number (12) is used in which \u2013 as in the Hartmann\nnumber \u2013 the viscosities \u03bd and \u03bc are symmetric. The ratio of\nthis Reynolds number Rem and the Hartmann number is basically free of any diffusivity. For fast enough rotation just\nthis ratio describes the rotational quenching of TI for various Pm. In this representation the results for Pm between\n0.01 and 10 are rather simple. The most effective stabilization of TI happens for Pm = 1. It is weaker for both smaller\nPm and higher Pm. This is an unexpected result which may\nwarn that many numerical simulations with Pm \u2243 1 could\noverlook the nonaxisymmetric instability of strong toroidal\nfields.\nAlso the inclusion of differential rotation leads to surprising results. For Pm = 1 the Fig. 5 presents the basic\ndifferences for rotation laws with different signs of d\u03a9 /dR.\nwww.an-journal.org\n\n9\n\nWhile superrotation always stabilizes the magnetic field,\nthere is a dramatic destabilization phenomenon by subrotation for medium rotation rates. This is the effect announced\nwith Eq. (1) by Acheson (1978). For slow and fast rotators\n(old and young stars with outer convection zones) with negative shear the toroidal magnetic fields have a very different stability behavior. Slowly rotating (old) stars with small\nRem can accumulate much stronger magnetic fields than\nyoung stars with their larger Rem. However, if the rotation is\ntoo strong then the nonaxisymmetric instabilities are more\nand more destroyed by the very strong shear (see Fig. 6).\nOur calculations demonstrate that rigid rotation always\nstabilizes the magnetic field against the nonaxisymmetric\nTI. We have also shown that this rotational stabilization\nshould be observable in the laboratory. Figure 11 provides\nthe result that the critical Hartmann number in a wide-gap\ncontainer of \u03b7\u0302 = 0.05 can be increased by a factor of two by\na rigid rotation of Reynolds number 1000. For the galliumtin alloy with its molecular viscosity of 3.4 * 10\u22123 cm2 /s\nthis Reynolds number is reached for a rotation frequency\n2\nof about 11.4/Rout\nHz with Rout in cm. The rotation frequency of 0.11 Hz for Rout \u2243 10 cm is rather small. For the\nsame container one needs the electric current of 7.32 kAmp\nthrough the gallium-tin alloy to realize the Tayler instability\nin the rotating fluid conductor.\n\nReferences\nAcheson, D.J.: 1978, RSPTA 289, 459\nBalbus, S.A., Hawley, J.F.: 1992, ApJ 400, 610\nChandrasekhar, S.: 1961, Hydrodynamic and Hydromagnetic Stability, Clarendon Press, Oxford\nChanmugam, G.: 1979, MNRAS 187, 769\nDubrulle, B., Knobloch, E.: 1993, A&A 274, 667\nHoward, L.N., Gupta, A.S.: 1962, JFM 14, 463\nKnobloch, E.: 1992, MNRAS 255, 25p\nKumar, S., Coleman, C.S., Kley, W.: 1994, MNRAS 266, 379\nMaeder, A., Meynet, G.: 2005, A&A 440, 1041\nMichael, D.H.: 1954, Mat 1, 45\nOgilvie, G.I., Pringle, J.E.: 1996, MNRAS 279, 152\nPessah, M.E., Psaltis, D.: 2005, ApJ 628, 879\nPitts, E., Tayler, R.J.: 1985, MNRAS 216, 139\nR\u00fcdiger, G., Hollerbach, R., Schultz, M., Elstner, D.: 2007a, MNRAS 377, 1481\nR\u00fcdiger, G., Schultz, M., Shalybkov, D., Hollerbach, R.: 2007b,\nPhys Rev E 76, 056309\nShalybkov, D.: 2006, Phys Rev E 73, 016302\nShalybkov, D., R\u00fcdiger, G., Schultz, M.: 2002, A&A 395, 339\nTagger, M., Pellat, R., Coroniti, F.V.: 1992, ApJ 393, 708\nTayler, R.J.: 1957, PPSB 70, 31\nTayler, R.J.: 1973, MNRAS 161, 365\nVandakurov, Yu.V.: 1972, SvA 16, 265\n\nc 2009 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.
