A relatively slow increase of\nperiod is followed by rapid increase and subsequent decrease.\nQuasi-periodic Oscillations (QPOs) are seen at periods of hundreds of seconds.

The DNOs are\nlow amplitude, moderately coherent luminosity variations\nwith periods in the range of 5\u201340 s. In the same kinds of\ncataclysmic variable (CV) stars there are also occasionally\nluminosity modulations of longer period (\u223c50\u20131000 s) and\npoor coherence, known as quasi-period oscillations (QPOs),\nfirst discussed by Patterson, Robinson & Nather (1977).\nA variety of statistical analyses and physical models\nhave been produced for the DNOs and QPOs (see review by\nWarner 1995a), but no generally accepted model yet exists.\nAlthough there has been significant progress, at least in restricting possible models, by observations made in the far\nultraviolet, it is still the case that further informative observations are to be encouraged. Here we present new and\narchival observations of VW Hyi, and discuss their implications. But first, in Sections 2 and 3, we review the status\nquo of observations and interpretations of DNOs and QPOs.\nIn Section 4 we present and analyse the observations of VW\nHyi. In a subsequent paper (Warner & Woudt 2002, hereafter Paper II), we develop a model to explain these observations, and apply it to other systems.\n\n\u22c6 email: pwoudt@artemisia.ast.uct.ac.za\n\u2020 email: warner@physci.uct.ac.za\nc 0000 RAS\n\n2\n\nDNO PHENOMENOLOGY\n\nIn the optical, DNOs are low amplitude, usually sinusoidal\nmodulations in brightness of moderate stability ('Q' factors\n= \u1e56 \u22121 of 104 \u2013106 ). Although not present in all dwarf nova\noutbursts, when they are observable they usually appear\nabout midway up the rising branch of outburst and disappear at a comparable brightness on the descending branch.\nTheir coherence is maximal at the brightest phase of outburst; on the descending branch they become less coherent\nand difficult to detect above the noise in the Fourier transforms.\nThere is a very strong correlation between oscillation\nperiod P and system brightness (Warner & Robinson 1972),\nsuch that P passes through a minimum about one day after\nvisual maximum, which is when the EUV luminosity reaches\nmaximum (Mauche 1996a,b). At this time, the rate of mass\ntransfer \u1e40 in the inner disc (and onto the white dwarf primary) reaches its maximum (Cannizzo 1993). Both the short\nperiods of the DNOs and their correlation with \u1e40 in the inner disc show that they have their origin near the surface of\nthe primary (Warner 1995b).\nThe amplitude and phase changes of the optical DNOs\nobserved during eclipses show that in the optical the entire disc is in some manner involved. This is interpreted\nas implying that modulated high energy radiation from\nthe central regions of the disc is reprocessed by the whole\ndisc. The phase variations can be understood only by an\nanisotropic radiation pattern revolving at the period of the\nDNOs (Warner 1987); this limits physical models to bright\nregions revolving on the surface of the primary or in the\ninner disc.\n\n\f2\n\nPatrick A. Woudt and Brian Warner\n\nOptical DNOs in some nova-like variables are intermittently present (e.g. in UX UMa, HL Aqr, V3885 Sgr), with\nperiods that wander slowly over ranges of a few seconds\n(Warner & Nather 1972; Knigge et al. 1998). DNOs are,\nhowever, not ubiquitous: despite intensive observation none\nhave been detected in RW Sex, nor in some other less wellobserved nova-likes.\nDNOs have been observed in the soft X-ray region of\nSS Cyg, VW Hyi, SU UMa and HT Cas during outbursts\n(see Warner 1995a for references; and van Teeseling 1997),\nin the EUV of SS Cyg (Mauche 1996a,b, 1998) and in the\nUV of UX UMa and OY Car with the use of HST (Knigge\net al. 1998; Marsh & Horne 1998). In general the oscillations\nare monoperiodic and sinusoidal; recently noted exceptions\nare OY Car where two periodicities are observed, one of\nwhich has a strong harmonic (Marsh & Horne 1998), SS Cyg\nwhere a low amplitude first harmonic is seen (Mauche 1997)\nand V2051 Oph where two periods and a harmonic are seen\n(Steeghs et al. 2001). At times, the soft X-ray modulations\ncan be as large as 100%.\nThe temporal behaviour of DNOs, as observed both\nin optical and X-rays, has features which constrict possible models. In dwarf nova outbursts, superposed on the\nluminosity-related systematic changes in P are intervals of\n1\u20132 h during which a constant period (with some phase\nnoise) exists, followed by an abrupt change to another stable period. This behaviour is well illustrated in Fig. 13 of\nWarner, O'Donoghue & Wargau (1989), Fig. 6 of Cordova\net al. (1980) and Fig. 11 of Jones & Watson (1992). As\npointed out by Warner (1995b), these abrupt changes (occurring within 100 s) are not accompanied by any noticeable\nincrease or decrease of luminosity and therefore cannot be\nascribed to a change in rotation period of any substantial\n(\u2265 10\u221212 M\u2299 ) mass. The SS Cyg X-ray observations show\njumps of up to 0.07 s (Jones & Watson 1992); those of VW\nHyi showed P changing abruptly from 14.34 to 14.26 s (van\nder Woerd et al. 1987); the abrupt changes of the \u223c25 s oscillations in TY PsA near outburst maximum are of \u223c0.15 s\nrelative to the slow secular change in P (Warner et al. 1989).\nDNOs alternating between 11.58 and 11.66 s have been seen\nin RU Peg in outburst (Patterson et al. 1977).\nMarsh & Horne (1998) have found DNOs in OY Car towards the end of a superoutburst. Their HST observations\nshow two periods near 18 s simultaneously present in the UV\nwith a separation of 0.22 s. Although a rare occurrence, such\npairs of periodicities have been seen before in optical DNOs.\nWe note in particular that periods of 29.08 and 30.15 s were\nfound in the nova-like V3885 Sgr (Hesser, Lasker & Osmer\n1974), but the former is normally the only (if any) period\npresent (Warner 1973); evidence for 26.42 and 26.73 s oscillations simultaneously present in KT Per during outburst is\ngiven by Robinson (1973); and the dwarf nova WZ Sge in\nquiesence shows 27.87 and 28.97 s periodicities, sometimes\ntogether and at other times separately (Robinson, Nather &\nPatterson 1978). Recently Steeghs et al. (2001) found 59.54\ns, 29.77 s and 28.06 s oscillations in the optical continuum\nof V2051 Oph on the decline from a normal outburst.\nThere is no clear evidence for the presence of more than\ntwo periodicities at a given time: some early claims (Warner\n& Robinson 1972) were later shown to be due to interference\neffects in the periodograms of signals with systematically\nchanging periods (Warner & Brickhill 1978).\n\nFinally, we note the perplexing optical behaviour of VW\nHyi near the end of its outbursts where in one instance a 30\ns DNO was observed to be modulated in amplitude by a\nQPO at a period of 413 s (Warner & Brickhill 1978) and\non another occasion a 23.6 s DNO was modulated at 253 s\n(Robinson & Warner 1984). This cannot be simply a beat\nphenomenon between DNO periods separated by \u223c2.2 s because the average (background) brightness is also modulated\nat the longer QPO period. This will become clearer below\nwhen we present the latest observations of VW Hyi.\n\n3\n\nQPO PHENOMENOLOGY\n\nQPOs in cataclysmic variables (see the compilation in Table 8.2 of Warner 1995a) can have a life of their own, independent of the DNOs. For example, QPOs with periods of\n\u223c75 s and \u223c150 s have been observed in U Gem (Robinson\n& Nather 1979) for which no optical DNOs have ever been\ndetected. DNOs and QPOs are sometimes present at different times in the same outburst, e.g. TY PsA (Warner et\nal. 1989). However, the amplitude modulation of the DNOs\nin VW Hyi at the QPO period shows that some interaction\nbetween the two processes can occur.\nThe QPO amplitudes are usually only a few \u00d7 0.01 mag,\nbut larger ranges have occasionally been seen. For example,\nthe 413 s QPO in VW Hyi in its November 1974 outburst\nhad a range of up to 0.12 mag (Warner & Brickhill 1978).\nSimilarly large QPOs with a period of 370 s have been observed in SW UMa (Kato, Hirata & Mineshige 1992); these\ncomprise a nearly sinusoidal variation of range 0.075 mag\nwith an additional narrow dip of depth 0.05 mag. The superoutburst of T Crv in February 2001 also showed QPOs, with\nperiod \u223c600 s and range 0.1 mag (VSNET 21 Feb 2001). We\nshow below some QPOs in VW Hyi in which individual oscillations have a range of \u223c0.4 mag.\nThe QPOs generally have average periods of 5 to 15\ntimes the DNO periods in those stars where they occur simultaneously. This statement becomes more strongly based\nif it is noted that many of the shorter period (\u2264 40 s) QPOs\n(Table 8.2 of Warner 1995a) should probably be reclassified\nas DNOs of low coherence.\nAlthough QPOs are seen to change in (mean) period in\na given object, unlike the DNOs no clear period-luminosity\nrelationship has yet been deduced. Our new observations of\nVW Hyi provide the first evidence for such a relationship.\nQPOs are rarely visible at high energies: four distinct\npossibilities are of 12% amplitude at 585 s in U Gem (Cordova & Mason 1984), of very low amplitude at 83 s in SS Cyg\n(Mauche 1997), of 2240 s in OY Car just after an outburst\n(Ramsay et al. 2001) and a modulation increasing in period\nfrom 63 s to 68 s and in amplitude from 14% to 21% in VW\nHyi (van der Woerd et al. 1987). Wheatley et al. (1996)\nobserved flux variations of large amplitude and time scale\n\u223c500 s in Ginga (2-10 keV) X-ray observations of VW Hyi\nmade at the end of outburst. As this is the place in the light\ncurve where we see optical QPOs in VW Hyi, it is extremely\nprobable that the X-ray observations are a different manifestation of the same phenomenon. We return to this later.\nOther possible X-ray QPOs are 290 s in AB Dra on the rise\nto outburst, 121 and 135 s in U Gem at quiescence and 254\ns in the nova-like RW Sex (Cordova & Mason 1984).\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n\fDwarf Nova Oscillations and Quasi-Periodic Oscillations in Cataclysmic Variables: I.\n\n3\n\nFigure 1. The light curve of VW Hyi on 5 February 2000, taken during the late decay phase of this dwarf nova outburst. The inset is\nan amplified view of a small part, showing the DNOs.\n\nIt is possible that there is more than one cause for\nthe QPOs. For example, it has been noted that the longest\nQPOs have periods close to the expected rotation periods\nat the outer edges of the accretion discs in CVs (Warner\n1995a), and Lasota, Kuulkers & Charles (1999) have suggested a model for one of the DNOs in WZ Sge which uses a\nplasma blob at the disc rim. Nevertheless, it is also possible\nthat all QPOs are caused by oscillations in the inner accretion disc. Perturbation analyses of such discs by Carroll et\nal. (1985), Lubow & Pringle (1993), and Collins, Helfer &\nvan Horn (2000) show the possibility of a wide spectrum\nof non-radial oscillations, analogous to p-mode and g-mode\noscillations in stars. The brightness oscillations are usually\nascribed to intrinsic luminosity variations in the disc itself,\nbut we point out in Paper II that they may also be caused\nby variation of intercepted radiation from the central high\nluminosity region of the disc, if there are vertical oscillations\nin thickness of some disc annuli.\n\n4\n\nPHOTOMETRIC OBSERVATIONS OF VW\nHYI\n\nThe dwarf nova VW Hyi is a rich source of short period luminosity modulations. It is the CV in which DNOs were first\ndirectly observable in the light curve (Warner & Harwood\n1973) (rather than only in the Fourier transform). Unlike\nmost dwarf novae, the optical DNOs in VW Hyi appear most\nconspicuously in the final stage of decline from an outburst\n(they could be present at a similar brightness at the start\nof an outburst, but no high time resolution photometry has\nbeen made that early) and follow a period-luminosity corc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\nrelation over the range 20\u201336 s (Warner & Brickhill 1974,\n1978; Robinson & Warner 1984; Haefner, Schoembs & Vogt\n1979; Schoembs & Vogt 1980).\n\n4.1\n\nEvolution of DNOs and QPOs in VW Hyi\n\nAt the end of the November 1974 normal outburst and of the\nJanuary 1978 normal outburst the QPO modulated DNOs\nalready mentioned above were observed (Warner & Brickhill 1978, hereafter WB; Robinson & Warner 1984, hereafter\nRW). This behaviour has remained unique to VW Hyi, and\nis clearly of potential value in understanding both QPOs and\nDNOs. We now report a third and even more significant observation of this phenomenon, which has led us to reanalyse\nother observations made over the past three decades.\nVW Hyi was observed on 5 February 2000 with the University of Cape Town CCD photometer attached to the 40\ninch reflector at the Sutherland site of the South African Astronomical Observatory. 3 s integrations in white light were\nused, with a run length of 5h 16m, starting at 18h 40m UT.\nA low time resolution light curve, corrected for atmospheric\nextinction, is shown in Fig. 1. VW Hyi was in the final stages\nof decline from a normal outburst which had commenced on\n3 February 2000. It was quickly apparent that in the light\ncurve VW Hyi had DNOs with a period of 28 s (see the inset\nof Fig. 1) and that these were partly modulated in amplitude with a period near 450 s, thus producing only the third\nclear example of such behaviour to be captured in nearly\nthirty years of sporadic photometry.\nThe general form of the light curve is shown in Fig. 1\nand is typical of the final decay phase of a dwarf nova outburst. There was a fall of 0.45 mag during the run; the\n\n\f4\n\nPatrick A. Woudt and Brian Warner\n\nFigure 3. Variations with time of the DNO and QPO periods in\nthe normal outburst of February 2000 (circles with error bars).\nDNOs are added for the superoutburst of December 1972 (triangles) and the normal outburst of February 2001 (squares). The\ntopmost panel shows the ratio of the periods in the February 2000\nrun.\n\nFigure 2. QPOs in the outbursts of (A) February 2000, (B)\nNovember 1974 and (C) January 1978.\n\nprominent large humps are the orbital modulation (arising\nfrom differing aspects of a bright spot) beginning to be seen\nagainst the fading background of the disc. A light curve\nof one orbit duration obtained on the following night has a\nhump of approximately the same amplitude (on an intensity\nscale) as in Fig. 1, showing that there were no large changes\nin mass transfer rate from the secondary in the late stages\nof this normal outburst. Eliminating the orbital humps, VW\nHyi was fading at 0.09 mag h\u22121 on our photometric system.\nAlso prominent in Fig. 1 are modulations with a time\nscale \u223c7 min which are present throughout, riding happily over the orbital humps and maintaining a peak-topeak range of \u223c0.10 mag. These represent an approximately\nconstant modulated fraction of the declining luminosity (if\nFig. 1 is plotted on an intensity scale the \u223c7 min modulation\nincreases in amplitude by a factor of 2 through the run).\nTo illustrate more clearly the \u223c7 min modulation, which\nis an example of a QPO, in Fig. 2 we have removed the mean,\nfirst order trend and orbital hump (represented by a sine\nwave and first harmonic at the orbital period) from the light\ncurve and have plotted mean brightnesses averaged over 10\nintegration bins (i.e. 30 s), which concomitantly smooths\n\nover the \u223c30 s DNOs described below. Fourier analysis of\ncontiguous sections of the light curve shows that the mean\nperiod of the QPOs increases from \u223c400 s to \u223c600 s during\nthe run. This variation is displayed in Fig. 3, and is the first\nclear example of a systematic dependence of QPO period\non luminosity. However, the QPO period of the final section\nis omitted because it has halved. The average pulse shapes\nare shown in Fig. 4. In the penultimate section some first\nharmonic is visible; in the final section it has become almost\nentirely first harmonic.\nIn two of the three previously published studies of VW\nHyi at the late phase of its outbursts (the November 1974\noutburst: WB, and the January 1978 outburst: RW) the\nmean brightness (interpolated under the orbital humps) was\nnearly constant and the QPO periods averaged 413 s and\n253 s respectively with no detectable systematic variations\nduring the runs (which had durations of 4.91 h and 3.60 h\nrespectively). The background-subtracted and binned light\ncurves, showing the QPOs, are incorporated into Fig. 2. The\nmean amplitudes (half peak-to-peak) of the QPOs in those\nruns were \u223c0.03 mag and \u223c0.02 mag respectively. In our\nobservations of the February 2000 outburst the mean amplitude is \u223c0.02 mag. In all three cases individual cycles can\nhave amplitudes from nearly zero to two or three times the\naverage.\nA third study (Warner & Brickhill 1974) was of VW Hyi\nat the end of a superoutburst and showed DNOs rapidly inc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n\fDwarf Nova Oscillations and Quasi-Periodic Oscillations in Cataclysmic Variables: I.\n\nFigure 4.

We have reanalysed the run and have\nincorporated the DNO evolution in Fig. 3. We also find low\namplitude QPOs, not recognised in the earlier study. After the superoutburst the DNOs lengthen in period more\nslowly than after the normal outburst. The ratio of periods\nPQP O /PDNO is nearly constant at \u223c 15 in both runs.\n\n4.2\n\nDNOs and QPOs in VW Hyi: the overall\npicture\n\nStimulated by the newly recognised evolution of the DNOs\nand QPOs we decided to reinvestigate our archive of VW\nHyi observations and to make new observations. In order\nto place each run in its respective position in the outburst\nwe constructed a grand mean light curve. It has long been\nknown that the decay parts of normal outbursts of a dwarf\nnova are very similar to each other (e.g. Bailey 1975), and\nalignments of superoutbursts of VW Hyi according to the final rise to supermaximum result in nearly identical outburst\nprofiles (Marino & Walker 1979). Because we are interested\nhere largely in the decay portion only, we have aligned these\nusing a data file for the years 1969 \u2013 2000 kindly made available by the Royal Astronomical Society of New Zealand. In\nperforming this analysis we found that normal and superoutburst declines closely follow the same profile. We also found,\nincidentally, that the normal outbursts can be classified into\nthree discrete groups, of different durations. Smak (1985)\nfound correlations of outburst widths with outburst intervals, but not that outburst widths show signs of preference\nfor certain values.\nFig. 5 shows the final 'template' which we used to define where our individual runs are positioned. The principal\nportion of the decay is identical independent of the type of\noutburst. The profiles near maximum, and the final decays\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n5\n\nFigure 5. Average profiles of superoutbursts and the three types\nof normal outburst.\n\nand brightnesses at quiescence, show small differences. The\nzero of the time scale is an arbitrarily chosen point.\n\n4.2.1\n\nThe DNOs\n\nIn the process of analysing the runs we discovered previously\noverlooked features. Table 1 lists the runs which had significant results \u2013 including absence of DNOs (our upper limit\non the DNO amplitude corresponds approximately to 3\u03c3\nsignificance) during outburst. We have omitted many of the\nruns made during quiescence which showed neither DNOs\nnor QPOs.\nThe first notable result is the presence of a DNO with\nperiod 14.06 s in the run made on 19 December 1982, on the\nplateau of a superoutburst at V \u2243 9.5, 9 days after the rise\nto maximum. Interestingly, it is at precisely the same period\nas that seen in the soft X-rays at V = 9.4 in the November\n1983 superoutburst of VW Hyi (van der Woerd et al. 1987),\nwhich will be discussed in Section 3 of Paper II. Schoembs &\nVogt (1980) found a 33.9 s DNO in the superoutburst of VW\nHyi of 27 October 1978, also at V \u2243 9.5. This perplexed us\nat first, until we noticed that their time resolution was 10 s,\nwhich would place a 14 s period above the Nyquist frequency\n\u2013 but the beat period between 10 s and 33.9 s is 14.18 s, so\nthere evidently was a 14.18 s DNO which appeared as a beat\nat considerably reduced amplitude. We also found a DNO\nat 14.29 s present for a short time in the superoutburst of 26\nOctober 1984. The optical and X-ray coverage of VW Hyi\nhas been quite extensive, so we conclude that these very\nstable 14 s DNOs are rare and of short duration.\nOur Fourier transform for 19 December 1982 is shown\nin Fig. 6, in which the spike at 14.06 s is very narrow, denoting a stable period over the \u223c2 h run. There is no significant\npower at the subharmonic or the first harmonic. In Fig. 7\nwe show O\u2013C and amplitude variations, relative to a con-\n\n\f6\n\nPatrick A.

Although there are slow variations\nin phase, these are limited in range and show none of the\nsudden jumps in period discussed below. This is the most\nstable DNO that we have observed in VW Hyi. The amplitude (\u223c0.001 mag) is very low and would not be detected\nif the signal were much less stable. It is possible, therefore,\nthat \u223c14 s modulation is commonly present at maximum\nlight but not detectable with common Fourier techniques.\nThere is a suggestion of sinusoidal variation of O\u2013C in\nFig. 7 with a period near the orbital period. The phasing relative to the position of the white dwarf in its orbit is in rough\nagreement with what might be expected of a light travel\ntime effect, but the expected O\u2013C range of 2aqsini/c(1 + q),\nwhere q \u2243 0.19 is the mass ratio, is only \u223c0.032 P, whereas\nwe see a range of \u223c0.2 P. The O\u2013C variations must therefore\nbe ascribed to small intrinsic variations in DNO period over\nthe 2 h run.\nWe also found three other examples of DNOs at periods\n(18 \u2013 22 s), shorter than any hitherto recorded in optical\nobservations.\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\nFigure 7. O-C diagram and amplitude variations of the 14.06 s\nperiod in the light curve of VW Hyi on 19 December 1982.\n\nIn Fig. 8 we show the evolution of DNO periods through\ndecline of outburst, based on the data in Table 1 and in Section 4.1. We have included the X-ray period (van der Woerd\net al. 1987) and Schoembs & Vogt's (1980) beat period in\nthis diagram. For V \u2264 12.5 there is a clear correlation between brightness and period, similar to what is commonly\nseen in dwarf nova outbursts. The slope of this relationship is \u03b1 = dlogP/dlogLopt \u2243 \u22120.15, which is just within\nthe range \u03b1 = \u22120.25 \u00b1 0.1 seen in other systems (Warner\n1995a). However, as VW Hyi fades through V = 12.5 the\nrapid increase in period illustrated in Fig. 3 takes over and\nthe slope steepens to at least \u03b1 \u2243 \u22122 when P has increased\nto 40 s. We have not yet caught the end of this short-lived\nphase. Subsequently, shorter periods (\u223c22 \u2013 35 s) are seen,\nbut whether there is a frequency doubling, and whether different outbursts behave differently, we do not have sufficient\n\n\f8\n\nPatrick A.

At this stage of outburst (the final approach\nto quiescence) the DNOs are very incoherent.\nOur observations provide the frequency histogram\nshown in Fig. 9, which displays the fractional success rate\nfor detection of DNOs on the decline of the outburst. In the\nrange 12.5 <\n\u223c 13.3 DNOs are almost always present.\n\u223c V <\nEarlier and later in outbursts their occurence falls away\nrapidly.\nThe DNOs present in the February 2000 light curve\npresent the highest signal-to-noise and longest data train\navailable to us. The detailed evolution of these DNOs is\nshown in Fig. 10 in which the upper and the lower panels\nshow O\u2013C curves, of \u223c4 cycles of DNO with 75% overlap,\n\nrelative to constants periods of 28.0 s and 33.0 s respectively\nfor the first and last halves of the run. The central panel\nillustrates the central 50 percent, calculated with respect to\na 30.5 s period. A few very uncertain points (because of\nsmall oscillation amplitude) have been omitted.\nThe quasi-cyclical variations of O\u2013C that are readily visible in the central section of each panel are present\nthroughout the run, and may be detected in the compression\nand rarefaction of points along the curves. These variations\noften correlate with QPO modulations and are described\nin Section 4.2.3. There are also, in this run as in most of\nour DNO observations, abrupt changes of period and occasional abrupt phase shifts. We illustrate in Fig. 11 some\nexamples of these discontinuities, which are of the same kind\nas already mentioned for other CVs in Section 2. There are\nabrupt period changes at times 0.4645 and 0.4810, and phase\ndiscontinuities at 0.4690 and 0.4780. After 0.4810 the change\nin period is so large that the O\u2013C values run off the top of\nthe panel and 'wrap around'. The O\u2013C variations in this example do not correlate with the general brightness changes.\n\n4.2.2\n\nThe QPOs\n\nA few runs have QPOs of large amplitude. These are listed\nin Table 1 and two average profiles are shown in Fig. 13.\nAlthough these QPOs are obvious in the light curves, their\npresence in VW Hyi (and, by implication, in the light curves\nof other CVs) has previously been ascribed to slow flickering. The most extreme examples are shown in the upper\npanel of Fig. 12, which shows the second run on VW Hyi\nmade by the senior author at a time when QPOs had yet to\nbe identified by Patterson et al. (1977), and which was used\nmerely as part of the series of runs which first disclosed orc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n\fDwarf Nova Oscillations and Quasi-Periodic Oscillations in Cataclysmic Variables: I.\n\n9\n\nFigure 12.

The coherence\nof the apparent large flares and dips in the upper panel of\nFig. 12 can be judged from the mean light curve (the lower\nprofile) given in Fig. 13.\nThe question of coherence is an important one. By their\nvery nature, QPOs of short coherence are difficult to detect\nin the Fourier transform. Fig. 14 shows the details of the\n71 min of light curve obtained on 23 September 1984 near\nthe end of a normal outburst. The QPO maxima, spaced\n300 s apart, are shown by vertical bars. We can interpret\nthe evolution of the QPO in this light curve as the growth\nand decay of a QPO (indicated by single vertical bars) over\nabout 5 cycles, followed by growth and decay over 4 - 6\ncycles of another QPO (double bars) of similar period, but\nphase shifted relative to the first QPO by \u223c0.4 cycle. Such\na phase shift leads to spread of power and lowering of peak\namplitude in the Fourier transform.\nA characteristic of large QPOs is that at their minima\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\nthey drag the intensity well below the smooth lower envelope\nof the light curve.\nWe illustrate in the lower part of Fig. 12 another light\ncurve, obtained near the end of a normal outburst, in which\nthe QPO phenomenon is very strong as judged by the dips\nand flares. The Fourier transform of this light curve, Fig. 15,\nshows the fundamental, first and second harmonics of a period near 2100 s, which account for the repetitive narrow\ndips marked in Fig. 12. The predicted times of orbital hump\nmaxima are shown in the light curve of 6 November 1990,\nthe first predicted hump is absent and the third is of low\namplitude. Rapid changes in hump size were also seen by\nWB and imply large variations of rate of mass transfer from\nthe secondary at the end of outburst, perhaps the result of\nsearching for stability after enduring a slightly increased rate\nthrough the effect of irradiation during the outburst.\nThe final entries in Table 1 list seven light curves in\nwhich, in the light of the experience of analysing QPOs in\noutburst, we see or suspect QPOs in VW Hyi at quiescence.\nThis is the first claim of the presence of QPOs in quiescent\nlight curves of a dwarf nova. We illustrate one of these light\ncurves in Fig. 16, and its Fourier transform in Fig. 17. There\nis a QPO with a period near 600 s which is strong in the first\nhalf of the run but decreases in amplitude during the latter\nhalf. The average profiles of the QPO for the first and second\nhalves are included in Fig. 16. There is some power at the\n\n\f10\n\nPatrick A. Woudt and Brian Warner\n\nFigure 13.

The upper two panels show the mean QPO profile in the\nfirst and second half of the run.\n\nNovember 1974. The DNO at 28.77 s has a companion at\n31.16 s and there is a peak very close to half the period of\nthe latter, giving physical authenticity to what might otherwise have been dismissed as a noise spike. The difference\nfrequency of the two DNOs is very close to that of the 349\ns QPO present in the light curve at that time. The sinusoidal profile of the 28.77 s signal, and the departure from\nsinusoidality of its companion (confirming the reality of the\nharmonic) are shown in Fig. 19. Clearly the 31.16 s signal\nis caused by interaction with the QPO signal \u2013 but is not\ndue to amplitude modulation otherwise there would be two\nsidebands of equal amplitude. The effect is similar to the\norbital sideband in intermediate polars (e.g. Warner 1986),\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n\fDwarf Nova Oscillations and Quasi-Periodic Oscillations in Cataclysmic Variables: I.\n\nFigure 17.

Fourier spectrum of the first 45 minutes of the light\ncurve on 3 November 1974.\n\nwhere the lower frequency signal arises from reprocessing of\na rotating beam (from the primary) periodically illuminating the secondary or bright spot region, which makes \"QPO\nsideband\" an appropriate description. In Paper II we suggest\nthat the QPO sideband arises from a progradely rotating\n'wall' in the inner disc.\nThese signals are only clearly present in the first part\nof the light curve. From an O\u2013C analysis we find that at\nthis time the DNOs show only relatively small jumps in period or phase, which is what allows the Fourier transform\nprocess to detect the signals easily. It is possible that in the\nremainder of this run, and in other similar runs, the QPO\nsideband and/or its harmonic may be physically present, but\ndo not stay still long enough to be captured by our analysis\ntechniques.\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n11\n\nFigure 19. Averaged profiles of the QPOs and DNOs illustrated\nin Fig. 18.\n\nIn the earlier studies by WB and RW examples were\ngiven of the amplitudes of the DNOs being modulated at\nthe QPO period. We have found several further examples of\nthis, though it is rare to find both oscillations of sufficient\namplitude for this to be readily visible. There are also examples where the DNO amplitude is unaffected by the QPO\nmodulation.\nThe examples are too numerous to show in their entirety, but reference to Fig. 14 illustrates some of these\npoints. Some of the QPO maxima have large DNO amplitude associated with them \u2013 in a way that indicates the\ngrowth and decay of DNO amplitude over the QPO maximum. Other QPO maxima have DNOs of low amplitude.\nDNOs of large amplitude can be seen midway between the\nfourth and fifth QPO maxima. DNOs of nearly constant\namplitude through a QPO cycle can be seen in the inset to\nFig. 1.\nTo expand on these examples, and those given in WB\nand RW, we show detailed analyses in Figs. 20 and 21.\nFig. 20 shows a positive correlation between DNOs and\nQPOs, in the sense that the DNOs have maximum amplitude at the peaks of the QPOs. During this run the DNO\nphases appear largely independent of the amplitude variations. In Fig. 21 the DNO amplitudes appear relatively uncorrelated with the large QPO modulation, but there is an\noverall anticorrelation between DNO phase and QPO. It is\ncertainly noticeable that the time scale of the modulations\nof DNO phase is similar to that of the QPO variations.\n\n5\n\nCONCLUDING REMARKS\n\nThis study was stimulated by the lightcurve of VW Hyi at\nthe end of outburst, obtained in February 2000 (Fig. 1). At\nfirst sight this light curve looks typical of the flickering seen\nin a CV late in outburst. But closer inspection shows that\nthere is almost no flickering present \u2013 the light curve is made\nup of an orbital modulation plus variable amplitude DNOs\n\n\f12\n\nPatrick A.
