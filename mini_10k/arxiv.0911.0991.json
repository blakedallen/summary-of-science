Instead, in the passive formation-flying paradigm,\nthe evolving orbits and the orientations of the spacecraft are\nconstantly monitored. By using advanced metrology and statistical modelling methods, the relative positions of the spacecraft can be determined with high accuracy, even if simple\nranging sensors are used. This knowledge enables the continuous phase reconstruction of a high-performance radio telescope aperture to be performed, while the individual constellation satellites rotate and drift over time.\n\nprovide an all-sky survey at very low radio frequencies, which\ncannot be observed from the ground; because the ionosphere\neffectively acts like a shield for frequencies below \u223c 10 MHz.\nSuch observations have not been performed since the Radio\nAstronomy Explorer (RAE 1 and 2) missions in the 1970's,\nas illustrated by the all-sky map [2] in Fig. 1, they were very\nlimited in terms of sensitivity and angular resolution. For all\npractical purposes, the low-frequency Universe is therefore\nuncharted. A mission that could fill this gap, and produce\nastronomical data of high quality, has therefore been on the\nwish list of many astronomers for more than three decades.\nThe major science goal is therefore an all-sky survey below\n10 MHz with better than 1 degree resolution.\nIn addition, the FIRST Explorer can be used to image the\nlow-frequency Sun and the evolution and propagation of coro-\n\nThe FIRST Explorer constellation consists of six daughter spacecraft with radio astronomy antennas, and a mother\nspacecraft for science and metrology data processing and\ncommunications. The location of the constellation at the second Lagrange point (L2) allows for a stable, low-drift orbit\nthat is sufficiently far away from Earth to avoid severe radio\nfrequency interference (RFI), while at the same being close\nenough to maintain operations using standard telemetry systems. A novel use of credit card sized mini solar sails on the\nspacecraft enables the constellation to stay within an overall\nmission envelope [1].\nThe main science objective of this pathfinder mission is to\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\naddress: david.robinson@psi-tran.co.uk\nat the Swedish Institute of Space Physics, P.

It can also perform long-term studies of all the radio-planets by providing\ndynamic spectra of the intense low frequency radio bursts that\noriginate in the planets' auroral zones. Due to the ionospheric\ncut-off, those planetary radio emissions are, with the exception of the Jovian decametric radiation, not accessible from\nEarth. Similar radio emissions are most likely produced also\nby extra-solar planets with magnetic fields and atmospheres.\nWith an intensity that can exceed their host star and a frequency content directly proportional to the planet's magnetic\nfield strength, those burst radio emissions hold a great promise\nas beacons for future extra-solar planet searches.\nLarger space-observatories based on the enabling passive\nformation-flying technology, but consisting of several small\nsatellite constellations, are being considered as the next step.\nThese observatories will have enhanced sensitivity and resolving power to address many fundamental science objectives in\nradio astronomy, such as detection and observation of extrasolar planets as well as comprehensive studies of the dark ages\nand the epoch of re-ionisation, by observations of high redshift 21 cm line emissions from neutral Hydrogen, which is\nthe only radiation believed to have survived from the period\nbefore the Universe became transparent [3]. With suitable\nlong integration times, FIRST Explorer can in itself gather\nhigh red-shift 21 cm line spectra that may be able to prove the\ndark ages hypothesis. A no-result is also very useful since it\nwill put limits on the maximum strength of these emissions at\nthe lowest frequencies, which are not accessible from Earth.\nThe FIRST Explorer mission concept study was commissioned by the European Space Agency (ESA) [4] and based\non an idea from one of the authors, Dr Constantinos Stavrinidis, Head of the Department of Mechanical Engineering at\nESA/ESTEC, to reduce formation flying mission costs. The\nstudy objective put forward by Dr Stavrinidis was to:\n\"Assess the potential of an innovative and valuable science mission to achieve with low cost, a 'passive' formation\nflying instrument, by allowing the formation to drift, and overcoming the need for demanding and expensive technologies\nfor position control systems to constantly servo the various\nspacecraft into tightly defined positions\".\nThe cost of current and previous formation flying mission\ndesigns are driven up by the need to employ sophisticated,\noften optical and thereto expensive, range sensors to monitor\nthe position and orientation of separate spacecraft to high precision; and the need to use complex active multi-axis micro\nthrusters on each spacecraft, to constantly servo the constellation into a defined position and orientation.\nThis is a challenge for a formation involving only two or\nthree spacecraft, but as the number increases the complexities\nof the servo control algorithm grows exponentially and then\nthe growing time-delays between command and control make\nthe challenge even more difficult.\nThe passive formation flying concept optimises the \"knowledge\" of the relative positions of the spacecraft \u2013 rather than\noptimising control of the position of the spacecraft. More\nsophisticated computational modelling is used as a trade-off\n\nagainst less sophisticated conventional ACOS (Attitude and\nOrbit Control System) instrumentation using active multi-axis\nthrusters.\nThis paper examines one possible mission concept using\nexample design criteria, and based on existing low-cost technology that has been demonstrated in space or on the ground.\nIt is not a full mission design study and many of the system\nparameters require further detailed design trade-off studies,\nbut the paper illustrates what could be achieved as an alternative to conventional science and technology demonstrator\nmissions.\nBy adopting a different paradigm, where the instrument\nadapts to a changing environment rather than the other way\nround and by postulating a mission scenario in a low-drift\nenvironment, we have designed a fresh (holistic) approach\nto the problem. The science goals have been iterated with\nthe mission architecture approach, to develop a mission concept that both tests the low cost passive formation flying idea,\nand yet still targets valuable new astronomical science results\nthat cannot be achieved from the ground or with conventional\nspacecraft designs. The resulting mission design is known\nas the FIRST Explorer, as it explores both the novel mission\ntechnology and control concepts and points the way to larger\nformations that can address some of the grand science challenges open to future space-borne low frequency radio astronomy missions.\n\nII. PASSIVE FORMATION-FLYING CONCEPT AND TOP\nLEVEL MISSION REQUIREMENTS\n\nFormation-flying studies to date have required continuous\nminute corrections to the orbital positions of the free flying\nsatellites in 6 degrees-of-freedom (DOF). This increases the\ncomplexity and associated risk of controlling the formation.\nAn alternative approach is to let the formation drift slowly\nand only make periodic corrections, or re-formations of the\nconstellation, or adaptation of the mission, if necessary. This\ntechnique can benefit from a dynamic and predictive metrology modelling approach to measure the relative positions in\n6 DOF to well defined range uncertainties that are within the\ntolerances of the science model, and then add corrections to\nthe science data to counter for the drift effects.\nIt so happens that a low-frequency distributed aperture radio telescope, with the spacecraft randomly distributed in a\nroughly spherical constellation, and with sensors based on sets\nof 3 orthogonal dipole antenna, can reform the image dynamically provided that the 6 DOF range and orientation information is provided to an uncertainty of between 1/100 and\n1/360 of the observation wavelength. With a nominal 5 MHz\nobserving frequency (wavelength of 60 m), this uncertainty\n(circa \u00b1150 mm) would be difficult to achieve from a ranging system based on simple low-cost omni-directional radio\ntransponders, if only the raw performance of the individual\ntransponders were used.\nHowever, as we will show, the uncertainty requirement can\nindeed be met comfortably, even for simple transponders, by\nfusing the raw data from three or more transponders placed\n\n\f3\non each spacecraft. That requires a multi-lateration ranging\nmodel that computes the exact range uncertainties and combines them in a co-operative way, which significantly reduces\nthe net uncertainty of the combined data. This technology\nhas been well developed for high-precision large-scale threedimensional (3D) metrology in terrestrial applications. To the\nbest of our knowledge, we are the first to have developed and\nadapted such a precision measurement model specifically for\npassive formation-flying.\nThe low-drift requirement was important in our choice of\norbit at the second Lagrange point (L2), because the disturbances there are relatively modest. Even so, a major issue for\nspacecraft that are using no, or minimal active control, with\nconventional propulsion systems, is that they would eventually drift out of an L2 orbit, and solar pressure would tend to\nseparate the spacecraft over time outside a reasonable 1 to 2\nyear mission operation envelope.\nThe solar radiation pressure, which at first glance seem to\nhave a negative influence on the mission life-time, can however be taken advantage of. We have proposed a spacecraft design that passively self-stabilizes and orientates itself towards\nthe Sun by means of solar radiation pressure alone; and which,\nin addition, uses credit-card sized mini solar sails, with active\ndeployment, to maintain the formation within the mission envelope for extended periods of time. With this design concept,\nuse of simple mission resetting thrusters on each spacecraft\nmight be considered only as back-up the first time the concept\nis tested at L2.\nOther key issues for the radio astronomy mission is the\nhigh demands on accurate timing and synchronization, the\ndata communication systems (10 \u2212 14 Mbps inter-spacecraft\ncommunication link), and the on board processing needs for\nthe science mission; to compensate for spacecraft drift motions and correlate the science data, which computationally is\na very heavy load.\nThe overall novelty of the proposed passive formationflying mission concept is embodied in the combination of existing technology. For the first time brought together in a novel\nmission design. The key elements that are novel in their combination are:\n\u2022 The use of low-cost mobile phone type transponders,\nfor inter-spacecraft ranging and communications of science and range data, together with a combined ultra-low\nmass antenna for radio astronomy and inter-spacecraft\nranging.\n\u2022 An advanced multi-lateration position and orientation\nmeasurement data-fusion model, which improves the\neffective accuracy of low precision radio range sensors\nby up to 30 times.\n\u2022 A novel spacecraft design that self-orientates using the\nsolar radiation pressure at L2 and uses mini solar sails to\nkeep the constellation within an overall radio astronomy\nmission envelope for an extended mission life.\n\u2022 The use of tri-axial antennas on each daughter spacecraft enables a full 4\u03c0 steradians field of view. The\n\nresolution and sensitivity of the all-sky survey will increase with mission lifetime and benefit from the slow\ndrifts and rotations of the constellation elements.\nThe top-level design challenges we have encountered are\ndiscussed in more detail in the sections below, in each case\nstudying existing technology or proven technology concepts.\nThe major issues considered are summarized as:\n\u2022 Achieving the required distributed aperture sensitivity\nand resolution to advance existing science, with an affordable constellation.\n\u2022 Significantly improving the knowledge of the interspacecraft separation and orientation over what is\nachieved by using simple ranging techniques only.\n\u2022 A radio ranging antenna/transponder and data management system compatible with the science sensor arrangements and demands.\n\u2022 Orbital control of the spacecraft separation and orientation that avoids expensive 6 DOF active control, is not\nvulnerable to drift forces from gravity gradient and solar radiation pressure, and keeps the spacecraft stable\nand sun pointing.\n\u2022 Efficient data linking and computational data fusion for\nboth the science and metrology data.\nIII.\n\nMISSION FUNCTIONAL AND PHYSICAL\nARCHITECTURES.\n\nIn order to have sufficient sensitivity and resolution, the\nFIRST Explorer science mission requires a distributed sparse\nantenna array. To comply with the main science objective,\nwhich technically is to simultaneously collect radio astronomy signals from the whole celestial sphere, vector antennas\ncapable of resolving all three components of the electric field\nvector are required. The limitation of communication bandwidth between Earth and L2, further requires the communication of the high bandwidth radio astronomy signals between\nspacecraft; so that they may be combined and processed to reconstruct the full distributed telescope aperture. This in turn\nrequires knowledge of the relative separation and orientation\nof the spacecraft. After the appropriate level of on board processing, the reduced astronomy data must subsequently be\ntransmitted back to Earth, for further post-processing, distribution and analysis.\nIn addition to being capable of capturing the science data to\nmeet the science objectives, the FIRST Explorer technology\nmission has to perform within several constraints. The spacecraft must be within range of the sensing and communicating\nmetrology (less than 25 km at the limit), with sufficient intersensor visibility for determining relative separation and orientation to the required accuracy. Solar panels must br aligned\nto the Sun axis within \u00b115 degrees. A sufficient mission duration is required to meet the science and metrology objectives\n(one year nominal, greater than two years preferred). Mass,\n\n\f4\npower, thermal and propulsion budgets must nevertheless be\nconsistent with a low cost mission.\nAlthough the constellation needs to be in a stable orbit it\ndoes not need to be pointed in a particular direction to make\nscience observations. A random volume distribution is preferred, taking account of collision avoidance and metrology\nand communication ranging limitations. A planar distribution\nmust be avoided, because in free space a plane antenna array\nwill have no means to tell what is \"up\" or what is \"down\".\nA spherical rather than disc shaped distribution is also more\nhelpful to the metrology. Both the science and the ranging\nmetrology model objectives can benefit from changes to the\nrelative positions of the spacecraft within the operating constraints.\nIn principle, spacecraft operating at L2 will experience a\nbalance between the combined gravitational pull of the Sun\nand Earth, and the centripetal force associated with orbiting\nthe Sun at that distance in one Earth year. In practice, there\nis a gravity gradient so that a spacecraft slightly further away\nwill experience a lower gravitational attraction, and a higher\ncentripetal force from the higher speed to complete an orbit\nof larger circumference. The net effect is an outward drift [5]\nand the formula for calculating the relative acceleration agg ,\ndue to the gravity gradient, of two spacecraft at L2, separated\nby a radial distance, D, is\nagg = 2D\n\n\u03bcS + \u03bcE\nrS3 \u2212 rE3\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03bcS = 1.327 \u00d7 108 km3s\u22122 and \u03bcE = 3.986 \u00d7 105\nkm3 s\u22122 are the gravity coefficients for the Sun and Earth, respectively, and where where rS = 1.48 \u00d7 108 km and rE =\n1.5 \u00d7 106 km are the radial distances from the Sun and Earth,\nrespectively.\nAs an example: two similar spacecraft where one is 1 km\nfurther away from the Sun will experience a relative drift of\nabout 150 km in a year.\nSpacecraft at L2 will also experience acceleration aSR ,\naway from the Sun due to solar radiation pressure, which may\nbe calculated from\n\naSR =\n\ncR S rE2 ASC\nc rS2 MSC\n\n(2)\n\nwhere cR = 1.6 is the (assumed) radiation coefficient, S =\n1353 Wm\u22122 is the solar constant, c is the speed of light, MSC\nis the spacecraft mass, and ASC its effective area.\nSpacecraft relative drift from solar radiation pressure is extremely sensitive to differences in the effective area presented\nto the pressure. For example: two 10 kg spacecraft with effective areas 0.314 m2 with a machined tolerance of 1 mm could\nexperience a difference in relative drift up to 900 km in a year.\nIn theory it might be possible to select a radial distance\nslightly closer to the Sun and Earth where the solar radiation\npressure was balanced by slightly stronger gravitational pull\nbut natural variations in solar pressure and gravitational effects make this impractical. Some form of drift management\nis therefore required to meet the basic mission requirements.\n\nTABLE I: Power budget for daughter spacecraft\nMain power consumers\n\nPower [W]\n\nData processing\nTiming (rubidium standard)\nMetrology (inter-satellite comms.)\n\n5\n10\n12\n\nMini solar sail area management\nPropulsion (operated periodically)\nMargin: 20%\n\n10\n5\n8\n\nTOTAL\n\n50\n\nA simple, robust and highly reliable method of controlling relative drift is by changing the effective area exposed\nto the solar radiation pressure. Because relatively small differences have significant effects over longer periods of time\nthe changes to effective area can be quite small. The easiest form is an extending or retracting 'sail area' as shown in\nFig. 2. Depending on the design this mini solar sail could be\ncontrolled by a space qualified 'stepper motor' or even possibly thermally actuated expansion and contraction. It would\nbe very important to ensure that the effect was balanced so\nas not to introduce unwanted torques. A further refinement\nmight be to effect some 'limited steering', by offsetting the\nmini sails and \"tacking across the solar pressure field\", but\nthis would need to be modelled carefully to determine feasibility and traded-off against the risks from greater complexity.\nA fall-back option is to put a micro thruster in the RAM face\nto counter the rate of drift.\nThis approach indicates a daughter spacecraft design similar to that in Fig. 2 with a target mass of 10 kg. The wedgeshaped body is built around a central circular thrust tube,\nwhich can also be used to stack the spacecraft for launch and\ntransit to L2. The one metre monopoles for LF sensing and\nmetrology antennae deploy once the spacecraft reaches its operational orbit. The electronics are packaged within the thrust\ntube to give maximum radiation shielding. A 50 W continuous power budget from a 0.1 m2 array has been estimated as\ndetailed in Table I.\nThe Mother spacecraft will need to manoeuvre very precisely with 6 DOF to deploy the daughter spacecraft with negligible relative linear or angular velocity. Ideally this should\nvary by less than 0.1 \u03bc N of thrust or torque.

The central 0.5 m diametre tube provides a thrust tube for launch configuration and houses all\nelectronics and the variable sail area. The sun facing (front) area is 67 \u00d7 15 cm2 and has a solar panel. The RAM face (back) area is 88 \u00d7 29\ncm2 . The sloping sides, top, and bottom, with 10 degree Chamfer and 60 cm lengths, provides self-correction to angular drift. The six\nmonopole antennas are arranged to balance solar pressure effects. They are connected pairwise to form three orthogonal dipoles (one vector\nantenna). The ranging sensors, located at their tips, doubles as inter-spacecraft communication antennas.\n\nFIG. 3: The hexagonal three-axis stabilised mother-spacecraft is built\naround a central thrust tube, 50 cm in diameter. It has flat top panels\nand two solar panel wings. Active thrusters are used for full 6 DOF\nspacecraft control. A steerable phased array is used for communication with Earth. The antennas used for ranging and inter-spacecraft\ncommunication are of the same design as the vector antennae on the\ndaughter spacecraft. They can be used for science, providing a 7th\nradio astronomy antenna or be used as a spare, if a daughter fails.\n\nfore have to be highly stable during these manoeuvres suggesting a highly effective 6 DOF AOCS and a significantly\nlarger mass than the daughter spacecraft. The mother spacecraft also needs sufficient propulsion for the transit to L2 and\nto remain in loose formation with the daughter spacecraft once\nthey have been deployed.\nIt is assumed that the mother spacecraft will be built around\na 0.5 m thrust tube providing the interface to the launch separation system below and the daughter spacecraft stack above.\nThe most challenging task for the AOCS is the very precise control of the separation of the daughter spacecraft. This\nrequires precise knowledge and control of the motion of the\nmother spacecraft at the time of each separation. A star\ntracker, even supplemented with sophisticated MEMS gyro\narrangements, is unlikely to offer the necessary accuracy. The\nchallenge therefore is to exploit the in-built metrology range\nsensor network in place for the formation-flying; in this case\nhowever the sensing will be 'rate' rather than 'position' based.\nThis may extend the deployment phase to allow sufficient 'settling time' and to build up a sufficient statistical sample to\nachieve the necessary accuracy.\nThe mother spacecraft must be capable of independent nav-\n\n\f6\nTABLE III: Mass budget for the FIRST Explorer spacecraft\nSub-system estimate\n\nMass [kg]\n\nElectric propulsion (wet mass)\nSolid chemical motor (transit)\nCommunications equipment\n\n50\n30\n5\n\nAOCS\nPower generation and distribution\nTiming and data processing\nStructure (incl. separation system)\nMargin\n\n5\n15\n5\n45\n40\n\nTOTAL Mother\nSix daughters (10 kg each)\n\n200\n60\n\nTOTAL All spacecraft\n\n260\n\nigation to L2 requiring Sun sensors and a simple star tracker.\nThe sun sensors would need to be arranged on all potential\nSun facing surfaces. The star tracker will probably be best\nplaced on the side of the spacecraft facing away from the sun\nduring transit to L2. For redundancy purposes, two star trackers are advisable. Miniature video cameras to observe critical\nmanoeuvres may be considered.\nThe propulsion system must both provide the transit to L2\nand precise control the spacecraft in 6 DOF once there. Probably only electric propulsion can offer the fine control needed\nbut it is unlikely to also have the power to achieve a rapid transit to L2. This probably needs a small solid chemical motor.\nFor the electric propulsion one can envisage two thrusters for\nthe Y, Z, pitch, roll and yaw motions and four thrusters for the\nX motion; each thruster is assumed to be capable of 2 mN in\nthe normal thrust mode and less than 0.1 \u03bc N in the differential mode. Rule of thumb calculations indicate that a 200 kg\nmother spacecraft and six 10 kg daughters, can move the kilometre or so needed between initial deployment positions in 4\nor 5 hours before settling time. It would therefore appear reasonable to plan the full six spacecraft deployment sequence\nover 6 to 12 days.\nThe mother spacecraft data processing will at a minimum\nneed to combine the science and range metrology data streams\nfrom the daughter spacecraft and re-transmit a pre-processed\nproduct to Earth. Preferably, the majority of science data fusion and metrology data processing would take place on the\nmother spacecraft with only the final processed product being\nrelayed to earth. Even after processing there will be a reasonable volume of data to be transmitted back to Earth and there\nmay be instances where raw data is required for analysis or\nanomaly investigation. A trade off study is needed to establish\nthe best balance between mother spacecraft processing power\nand the volume of data for Earth transmission. At this stage\nwe propose an X-band link, capable of several Mbps data rate,\noperating through a flat plate phased array which can be deployed from the side of the Mother spacecraft after separation\nfrom the launch vehicle. Some rudimentary mechanical steering may also be needed.\nThe estimated power budget for the mother-spacecraft is\n\nbased on realistic assumptions and detailed in Table II, which\nin round terms suggests the need for 250 W of BOL installed\npower, which ould be met with two 2 \u00d7 0.25 m2 solar panels. These considerations suggest a mother spacecraft design\nconcept as shown in Fig. 3.\nGiven the relatively low propellant requirements with electric propulsion, a total mass budget of 260 kg for the FIRST\nExplorer mission has been estimated, as detailed in Table'III\nIt is considered to be challenging but not unreasonable (based\non a 20% margin).\n\nIV.\n\nCOMMUNICATIONS AND RANGING SYSTEM\n\nThe overall system aims to fulfil three objectives: transmission of the science data, transmission of signal and control\ndata, and ranging. Within the approach that we have chosen, RF power, system complexity, operating-range limits and\nrange accuracy are issues that have conflicting requirements.\nThe principal technologies that we have considered are IEEE\n802.11 (WiMAX) [6], which is an Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA) 20 MHz bandwidth system\ncapable of transmission rates of up to 54 Mbps and Wideband\nCode Division Multiple Access (WCDMA), which is a 5 MHz\nbandwidth system used for mobile communications with data\nrates of up to 384kbps [7].\nIn the ideal configuration, the separation of the mother and\ndaughter satellites will be comparable and in the region of\n5\u221215 km. The optimum configuration for communication is a\nstar network, as used in mobile communications and wireless\nnetworks, with the mother as the controller. However, if the\nsatellites drift into a non-ideal configuration, the separation\nbetween all satellites and their near neighbours may be close\nenough to permit communication but may exceed the range\nlimits for a star network. An alternative data path is required\nin case the direct link to the mother spacecraft is lost. The required configuration will be a peer-to-peer or ad-hoc network,\nsimilar to mobile sensor network architectures, where one of\nthe daughter satellites acts as the controller, and the data is\npassed back to the mother spacecraft in multiple hops.\nAs illustrated in Fig. 4, the proposed communications architecture will comprise a main, high-bandwidth star network\ncentred on the mother satellite and a secondary reconfigurable\nnetwork between all of the satellites. The secondary network\nalso provides both communication and ranging functions.\nWithin the constellation, the majority of the communication\nbandwidth will be used to transmit the science data back to the\nmother satellite. The science data from each of the satellites\nrequires a capability of circa 14 Mbps to support an acquisition bandwidth of 100 kHz.\nAs all the spacecraft drift they will have different rotation\nrates and relative orientations so it is essential that the antennas radiate with a wide field pattern to maintain communication. The path loss can be calculated using the Friis equation\n[8], which can be written\nc|\u03b5r * \u03b5t\u2217 |\nPr = Pt Gt (\u03b8t , \u03c6t )Gr (\u03b8r , \u03c6r )\n4\u03c0 f D\n\u0012\n\n\u00132\n\n,\n\n(3)\n\n\f7\nThe range limit can then be calculated from\ns\nc|\u03b5r * \u03b5t\u2217 |2 Pt hGt ihGr ihGd i\nDlim =\n,\n4\u03c0 f\nkB Trec nSNR \u2206 f\n\nwhere Pt and Pr are the transmitted and received powers, respectively, Gt and Gr the corresponding antenna gain patterns,\nf is the frequency, c is the speed of light, and D the separation distance. Polarisation losses are accounted for by means\nof the absolute value squared of the scalar product between\nthe antenna polarisation (unit) vectors, \u03b5t and \u03b5r . These are in\ngeneral complex valued but becomes real valued for linearly\npolarised antennas.\nFor the calculations we have assumed an antenna gain of\n1.5 dB, typical of a linearly polarised electric dipole antenna,\nand average orientation and polarisation penalties of 3 dB. At\n10 km range and an operating frequency of 2 GHz we anticipate an average path loss of 121 dB between any pair of\nantennas. In practice, as there are several antennas to allow\nfor the relative orientations of the satellites it will be possible\nto make use of receive (and transmit) diversity to increase the\nsystem sensitivity.\nPower, range and data throughput are intimately connected.\nPrevious work by Mahasukhon et. al. [9] showed that the popular IEEE 802.11 WLAN standards, require a Signal-to-Noise\nRatio (SNR) of about 22 dB to achieve 54 Mbps operation and\n3 dB to achieve 6 Mbps operation. Although the maximum bit\nrate is 54 Mb/s, the saturation throughput depended on the exact implementation of the standard. For a channel bit error\nrate (BER) of 10\u22125 the saturation throughput is 23.2 Mbps for\nIEEE 802.11a and 9.7 Mb/s for IEEE 802.11g. The inference\nis that, the Media Access Control (MAC) layer and operating frequency will need to be tailored for this application to\nachieve the required performance and range.\nA noise power of \u2212100.8 dBm has been calculated assuming a 20 MHz bandwidth and a receiver temperature Trec =\n300 K. The limiting range can be found for any frequency\nand SNR by rearranging the Friis equation, Eq. (3), and using\nthe noise threshold levels calculated from [9]. An additional\nfactor, Gd , which accounts for the diversity gain, has been\nincluded in the equations because each satellite uses several\nantennas and these signals can be combined constructively to\nincrease the sensitivity. In this analysis the average value of\nthe diversity gain has been conservatively set to Gd = 2 (3 dB).\n\nwhere kB is the Boltzmann constant, \u2206 f is the bandwidth,\nhGt i and hGr i are the average values for the antenna gains\n(isotropic, 0 dBi) and nSNR is the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)\nrequired to support a specific data\n\u221a rate. The polarisation factor |\u03b5r * \u03b5t\u2217 | has been set to 1/ 2, which corresponds to an\naverage misalignment between the polarisation vectors of 45\ndegrees. The results, shown in Fig. 5, infer that a system based\non IEEE 802.11 coding standards will meet the bandwidth and\nrange requirements.\nThe ranging system provides the data for the multilateration model to determine the relative positions and orientations of the spacecraft. The two main ranging options are\nto use an independent, self-contained solution, or to use a cooperative approach. The limitation of the self-contained radar\napproach is that the returned power is inversely proportional\nto the fourth power of the separation between the source and\ntarget, limiting the operating range. For this reason a cooperative, communications based approach has been adopted. Each\ntwo-way communication link provides ranging information so\nthe desired outcome is to maintain communication links between all or as many of the satellites as possible. The number\nof two-way links N2way can be calculated from the number of\nsatellites N as N2way = N(N \u2212 1)/2.\nThe system will require many separate communication\nlinks. Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) techniques\nuse orthogonal codes to provide diversity and hence allow the\nre-use of the carrier frequency. A code length of 256 bits will\nprovide 64 orthogonal code channels.\nIn ground-based systems, the location accuracy of mobile\ntransmitters within a cellular radio system may be limited by\nnon line-of-sight errors [10] to about 20 metres and this can\nbe considerably improved using interferometric techniques to\ngive accuracies of 0.6 m [11]. In a space environment, multipath fading signals will be much less of an issue as the separa-\n\n30\n6 Mbps\n9 Mbps\n18 Mbps\n24 Mbps\n38 Mbps\n48 Mbps\n54 Mbps\n\n25\n\nRange [km]\n\nFIG. 4: Communications and ranging showing the primary and secondary networks.

There will be\nsome interaction between the antennas and the spacecraft that\nwill require calibration and correction to achieve the required\naccuracy.\nThe inference of these studies is that the timing accuracy\nachievable through the MAC layer is insufficient to provide\nthe required ranging accuracy but will ensure that more accurate methods do not suffer from cyclic errors.\nSeveral options are available for cooperative ranging: time\nof flight for a re-transmitted signals gives a resolution that is\ninversely proportional to the signal bandwidth \u2206R \u2248 c/3\u2206 f .\nEdge timing of a Time-Domain Diversity communications\nsystem with a bandwidth of 20 MHz would correspond to an\naccuracy of 5 m, which is insufficient for the requirement.\nUsing a short RF pulse, rather than the communications system, could improve the accuracy by an order of magnitude but\nco-operative management of the ranging function throughout\nthe constellation would be more difficult as only one satellite\ntransponder could obtain range information at a time.\nThe relative motion of the satellites must be taken into account in any implementation. As the distance between the\ntwo craft separates the phase of the received and demodulated\nRF signal will rotate through 2\u03c0 for every wavelength of separation. In a typical system, the phase or frequency of the\nVoltage Controlled oscillator will track these variations. If\nthis information can be accessed within the RF chip/chip set\nit will correspond to an uncertainty of circa \u00b130 mm for a 2\nGHz carrier, assuming a phase stability of \u00b11.25 radians.\nConsider the simple implementation shown in Fig. 6, where\na received signal is frequency shifted and retransmitted. As\nthe reference oscillators within each of the satellites are independent, the signal processing system must be designed to\nseparate frequency shift, velocity components, and 2\u03c0 ambiguities. Uncertainties in satellite time-transfer have been studied in detail [12], and the expected uncertainty of the transponder path-delay calibration is expected to be less than 1 ns [13],\ngiving an overall uncertainty better than \u00b1150 mm.\nIn summary, a communication system based on COTS\nhardware with additional components is expected to have the\n\nFIG. 6: Cooperative ranging by re-transmitting a frequency-shifted\nsignal.\n\ncapability of providing the required data handling (14 Mbps\nper satellite) at circa 5 \u2212 25 km separation and a ranging uncertainty of less than \u00b1150 mm, as required by the proposed\napplication.\n\nV. FUSING RANGE MEASUREMENTS TO DETERMINE\nFORMATION CONFIGURATION GEOMETRY\n\nThe basis of the FIRST Explorer passive formation-flying\nconcept is that of allowing movement between spacecraft but\nwith the relative locations and orientations of the spacecraft\ndetermined to precise limits from range data. A mathematical\n(multi-lateration) model and associated software have been\ndeveloped to analyse various designs and to predict the uncertainty in configuration geometry from range and time measurements.\nThe model assumes a fixed number of spacecraft undergoing approximately constant linear and angular motion where\neach spacecraft has a fixed number of range transponders or\ntargets at known positions. At any given time, six parameters\nare required to determine the position of a spacecraft: three\nto determine location and three to determine orientation. Six\nconstraints need to be applied to fix the frame of reference of\nthe overall constellation of spacecraft. For spacecraft undergoing constant linear and angular motion, twelve parameters\nare required per spacecraft, six to determine an initial position,\nthree to specify the direction and speed of the linear motion,\ntwo to determine the axis of rotation and one to specify the\nspeed of angular rotation. Nine constraints need to be applied,\nsix to fix a frame of reference and three to specify the initial\nlinear motion applying to the constellation as a whole.\nIn practice, the behaviour of the range transponder will depend on the angles of the line-of-sight. The model assumes\nthat this behaviour can be specified in terms of one or more\ndirection vectors and acceptance angles associated with the\ntarget position. If the angles between line-of-sight joining\ntwo targets are smaller than the acceptance angles at each of\nthe targets, then the associated range measurement is admissible. At any given time, the acceptance angles associated\nwith a range measurement between any pair of targets can be\nestimated from the parameters describing the motion of the\nconstellation.\nIt is assumed that each measured range value estimates the\ndistance between a pair of targets at a given time, one target\non one spacecraft, one on another. To each range measurement is associated a time and two indices specifying the two\ntargets. Uncertainties are also associated with the range measurements, based on a characterisation of the transponders and\ncan be used to provide weights for the measurements. For example, each range measurement can be weighted according to\nthe angles of incidence, with the maximal weight equal to one\nif the line of sight is aligned exactly with the corresponding\ndirection vectors.\nGiven motion parameters, contained in the vector a(t),\nspecifying the motion of the constellation, at any given time\nt, the distance Dnm = Dnm (a(t)) between any two targets, n\nand m, can be predicted. Given range measurements, dnm ,\n\n\f9\nconcept, the number of spacecraft has been fixed at six, with\nup to six transponders on each daughter spacecraft. A primary\nconcern is having enough range measurements to provide an\naccurate assessment of the constellation geometry for almost\narbitrary motion of the spacecraft. A balance has to be made\nbetween\na) maximising the number of admissible range measurements for a particular, ideal constellation geometry, and\nb) making sure that if the constellation drifts from its optimal shape there are sufficient range measurements\navailable to meet the accuracy requirements.\n\nFIG. 7: Admissible range measurements associated with six targets\non each of six satellites in an initial position (top panel) and after\ndrifting (bottom panel).\n\nestimates of the motion parameters, a can be determined by\nmatching the model predictions to the actual observations in\nthe least squares sense. The uncertainties associated with the\nrange measurements can be propagated through to those associated with the fitted parameters using standard methods\n[14, 15, 16]\nA set of simulation tools has been implemented in Matlab.\nThe software is completely flexible with respect to the number and configuration of spacecraft, the number, location and\nacceptance behaviour of the targets (range transponders on the\nspacecraft), and the number and timings of the range measurements; all that is required is that each range measurement has\nan associated time and indices specifying the targets involved.\nIn terms of design considerations for the FIRST Explorer\n\nIt is assumed that any constellation will suffer from drift\nand that over a long period there can be no guarantee that a\nconstellation will match a preferred geometry. Furthermore,\nthe slow rotation of each spacecraft about its main axis cannot\nbe ruled out. This means that a transponder design that depends significantly on a particular constellation geometry runs\nthe risk of degraded performance as time progresses. The simulations discussed below make the following assumptions: the\ncentre of gravity of each spacecraft drifts linearly a few metres over the time scale of a few days, each spacecraft rotates\nabout an axis a few times per day, the rates of rotation about\nthe axes are different. The simulations reported below also\nassume that each spacecraft maintains at least a rough alignment with the sun (up to 30 degrees misalignment). The most\nsignificant assumptions above relate to rotation since they are\nused to make sure the constellation geometry does not become\nstuck in a static case in which there are very few admissible\nrange measurements. The conclusions below hold for different rates of drift and rotation if the time scales are adjusted\nappropriately.\nThe transponders have the following acceptance behaviour\nconsistent with a radio transponder that is not fully omnidirectional but has preferred gain patterns of sensitivity. Each\ntransponder is associated with a direction vector. If a line of\nsight makes an angle of between 60 and 120 degrees with the\ndirection vector, the range measurement is admissible for that\ntransponder. Thus, a range measurement is admissible for a\ntarget if it makes angles of less than 30 degrees with the plane\northogonal to the direction vector; this is termed a \"doughnut\"\nacceptance profile. Additionally, a range measurement is admissible for that target if the line of sight makes angles of less\nthan 30 degrees with the direction vector, giving a \"one-sided\ncone\" acceptance profile. A range measurement is admissible\nif it satisfies at least one of the acceptance criteria at each end.\nThe advantage of the design of transponder is that if the\ndirection vector is not aligned with the axis of rotation of the\nspacecraft, the doughnut acceptance region sweeps through\nthe whole of 3D space in one rotation so that the transponder\nhas a chance to see all others in the constellation. The different\nrates of rotation are used to guarantee that the rotations are\nnot locked together making some, possibly many, of the range\nmeasurements permanently inadmissible.\nThe following simulations involve six spacecraft randomly\nsituated in an oblate sphere of equatorial diameter 5 km and\npolar diameter 3 km.

Each satellite has six transponders situated at the centre\nof the faces of a cube of side 3 m.

However, as shown by the illustrations in\nFig. 7, the admissibility profile can change as the formation\nevolves with time. The simulation has shown that For 100\ntime steps, there are typically over 5000 admissible range\nmeasurements.\nThe evaluated uncertainties associated with the interspacecraft distances, as shown in the left panel of Fig. 8, are\nof the order of better than \u00b110 mm at all time steps and the\nuncertainties associated with the angles, as shown in the right\npanel of Fig. 8, are less than \u00b10.5 degrees.\nThe uncertainties for the inter-spacecraft distances have a\ntypically U-shaped behaviour with respect to time. The distances for middle time periods use information from the past\n\nand future, while initial and final time periods can only use\nfuture or past measurements, respectively. The uncertainties\nassociated with the angles are much more sensitive to which\ninter-target pairs are associated with admissible range measurements and hence vary from time step to time step as the\nadmissibility pattern changes. Integrating over a long time or\ntaking measurements at a greater rate would reduce the uncertainties further.\n\nVI. THE SCIENCE MISSION REQUIREMENTS\n\nThe Universe at very low frequencies is virtually unexplored, as illustrated in Fig. 1 by the very sparse all-sky map\nat 4.70 MHz. It was constructed from observations made by\nthe Radio Astronomy Explorer 2 (RAE-2) [17] and published\nin 1978 by Novaco & Brown [2]. It is still the best picture\nwe have of the Universe at this very low frequency. The main\nreason for our evident lack of knowledge is the Earth's ionospheric plasma, which effectively blocks out radio frequencies\nbelow the ionospheric cut-off, about 10 MHz, and makes observations below \u223c 30 MHz very difficult. Therefore, astronomical observations at low frequencies require a space borne\nradio telescope.\nThe FIRST Explorer is aimed to be such a telescope. Its\nprimary science objective is to provide a new all-sky survey\nat very low radio frequencies with improved sensitivity and\nan angular resolution better than 1 degree. A secondary objective is to observe radio sources in the solar system, such as\nthe low-frequency Sun and non-thermal planetary radio emissions. Those emissions will in any case interfere with the\nall-sky survey and therefore needs careful monitoring. The\nsecondary objective thereby complements the primary one. A\nthird objective is to try to detect high red shift 21 cm Hydrogen line emissions [3], or at least put limits on the maximum\nstrength of the low-frequency part of this radiation, which\n\n\f11\nshould now be in the 9 \u2013200 MHz range. It is the only known\nway to probe the \"dark ages\" from recombination to reionisation, a transition period when the first galaxies were formed\nand the Universe went from being completely opaque (the\ndark ages) to becoming transparent when the first stars formed\nand were able to ionise the interstellar medium. A detection\ncould prove the dark ages hypothesis, which would be major\nstep in observational cosmology.\nLow-frequency radio astronomy tends to be very suitable\nfor a space mission. As one first might think, it does not require a huge dish antenna to be deployed or constructed in orbit. Instead, and as we will show, a relatively modest array of\nsimple dipole antennas can be used. The physical reason for\nthis is the effective collecting area of the dipole, which is proportional to the wavelength squared. To increase the area, and\nhence the sensitivity, one just adds more dipoles to form an\nantenna array; although, a space array requires several spacecraft flying in formation.\nThe sensitivity increases linearly with the number of spacecraft so even though the RAE-2 used a 229 meter long\ntravelling-wave V-antenna as well as a 37 meter long dipole\n[17], a space array would be a considerable step forward. The\nlargest improvement, however, would be if the antenna signals\ncould be combined and used to perform radio interferometry.\nWith suitable separation distances that would dramatically improve the angular resolution of the observations.\nThe science cases for space borne low-frequency radio astronomy are well established [18] and have been worked upon\nsince the last attempt by RAE-2 and free-flying as well as\nlunar-based observatories have been proposed. The Astronomical Low-Frequency Array (ALFA) [19] and the Solar\nImaging Radio Array (SIRA) [20], are two noteworthy NASA\nstudies of the free-flying concept, none of which became realised. Sadly, the high cost, associated with the complex\ntechnologies traditionally considered necessary for precision\nformation-flying, has always been an Achilles heel for previously proposed low-frequency space arrays; not to mention\nthe cost of a deploying an antenna array on the Moon. The\nFIRST Explorer, on the other hand, uses passive formation flying, which for the first time can make a low-frequency space\nobservatory affordable.\nThe slowly drifting and rotating spacecraft put new requirements on the science payload, i.e., the radio astronomical antennas. The drift is actually not a problem but an advantage. It\nallows sampling of more baselines and hence gives better coverage than would a traditional formation, where the spacecraft\nare forced to stay put at locked positions. The rotations can be\ntaken care of by using a vector antenna, consisting of three orthogonal electric dipole antennas, which allows sampling of\nthe full three-dimensional electric vector field, E((x)n ,t), at\nthe satellites' positions xn and time t. The electric field vector\nEn (t) = E(xn ,t) picked up by the antenna on the nth satellite\nis low-pass filtered, digitised, bandpass filtered and converted\nto base-band by the radio receiver. It is represented as a time\nseries of complex vectors.\nSince we are only considering astronomical source the intensities In = hEn * E\u2217n i (brackets mean time average) are equal\non every spacecraft. Because In is a scalar it is invariant under\n\nFIG. 9: Geometry of a two-element interferometer of length D, receiving a radio wave from an angle \u03b1 . The time and distance errors,\n\u2206D and \u2206t, respectively, give rise to a pointing error \u2206\u03b1 .\n\nrotations [21], also those performed by spacecraft. In terms of\nintensity, a receiving vector antenna is therefore isotropic.\nHowever, intensity measurements are not sufficient to perform interferometry. We must also be able to measure the time\ndifferences between the field vectors registered on different\nspacecraft. Let En = E0 exp(i\u03a6n ), where \u03a6n is the phase. The\noperation En * E\u2217n = E0 * E\u22170 makes the phase information vanish but if we instead take the scalar product without complex\nconjugation (denoted by superscript \u2217) we find that the operation En * En = E0 * E0 exp(i2\u03a6n ) preserves the phase, which\ncan then be recovered, since \u03a6n = Arg[En * En ]/2. The complex scalar En * En is also rotation invariant and in that sense\nthe phase \u03a6n can be said to be absolute.\nIf we instead would use the phase from only one E-field\ncomponent that would not have been the case since the component values are dependent on the coordinate system. Therefore, rigorous tracking of the spacecraft attitude, and continuous compensation for their rotations in software, would have\nbeen required.\nIn addition to being rotation invariants, using the Maxwell\nequations, it is not difficult to show that E*E* as well as E*E\nobey conservation laws and are thus true physical observables.\nHaving established that vector antennas can be used as\nisotropic and phase preserving astronomy sensors it is clear\nthat the performance of the FIRST Explorer array to a very\nlarge extent will depend on precise time and precision range\nmeasurements.\nFor simplicity, consider a two-element interferometer with\nantennas separated by a distance D and receiving a radio pulse\nfrom an angle \u03b1 with respect to the baseline between the two\nantennas. As illusttraded in Fig. 9, the radio pulse, which travels with the speed of light, c, hits the first antenna at time t = 0.\nIt will hit the second antenna at a later time t. Using basic\ntrigonometry we obtain the formula\nct = D cos \u03b1 .\n\n(5)\n\nHence, by measuring time t and separation distance D we\ncan calculate the direction to the source. Or vice versa, by\nusing time delays or changing the separation distance we can\npoint the interferometer in different directions. In reality, time\nand distance can never be determined exactly and the errors\nwill result in an uncertainty in the pointing accuracy, \u2206\u03b1 ,\n\n\f12\nwhich is the angular resolution of the interferometer.\nLet t \u2192 t + \u2206t and D \u2192 D + \u2206D, where \u2206t denote the timing error and \u2206D the error in distance, as shown in Fig. 9\nTrigonometry yields\nc(t + \u2206t) = D cos \u03b1 + c\u2206t = (D + \u2206D) cos(\u03b1 \u2212 \u2206\u03b1 ) .\n\n(6)\n\nNote that \u2206t > 0 gives \u2206\u03b1 < 0 but \u2206D > 0 gives \u2206\u03b1 > 0,\nwhich means that the errors may cancel each other. To investigate if they do we assume the errors to be independent and\nGaussian with zero mean values. Squaring Eq. (6) and taking\nthe time average yields\nh(D cos \u03b1 + c\u2206t)2i = D2 cos2 \u03b1 + c2 h\u2206t 2 i\n\n= h(D + \u2206D)2 cos2 (\u03b1 \u2212 \u2206\u03b1 )i\n\n\u2248 D2 cos2 \u03b1 + h\u2206D2 i cos2 \u03b1 \u2212 D2 cos(2\u03b1 )h\u2206\u03b1 2 i , (7)\nwhere in the last step we have used the Maclaurin series expansions of cos \u2206\u03b1 and sin \u2206\u03b1 . Thus, on average, the standard\ndeviations of the time and distance errors help to reduce the\nstandard deviation in pointing accuracy.\nh\u2206D2 i cos2 \u03b1 \u2212 c2 h\u2206t 2 i \u2248 D2 cos(2\u03b1 )h\u2206\u03b1 2 i ,\n\n(8)\n\nA space array must be able to handle radio waves coming\nfrom all directions. Assuming that the sources are uniformly\ndistributed we integrate Eq. (8) from \u03b1 = 0 to \u03b1 = 2\u03c0 , which\nyields h\u2206D2 i \u2248 2c2 h\u2206t 2 i. In other words, to minimise the average standard deviation of the pointing accuracy, the standard\ndeviations of the time and distance errors, \u03c3\u221a\u2206t and \u03c3\u2206D respectively, should be chosen such that \u03c3\u2206D = 2c\u03c3\u2206t . By this\nchoice, the angular dependency in Eq. (8) actually vanishes,\ninstead\nh\u2206\u03b1 2 i \u2248\n\nh\u2206D2 i c2 h\u2206t 2 i\n=\n.\n2D2\nD2\n\n(9)\n\nIn Section V it was shown that an inter-spacecraft distance\nuncertainty of \u00b110 mm was possible to achieve. To match that\nerror, as to minimise the average pointing uncertainty, would\nrequire a time uncertainty of \u00b124 ps. For a 1000 m baseline the corresponding pointing uncertainty is only \u00b12 arcseconds, well below the required 1 degree resolution. While\nit has shown possible to achieve such small time uncertainties in ground based antenna arrays, using a common reference frequency and adjusting the phase of the receivers by using GPS clocks [22], that approach is impractical for a space\nobservatory, which aims to be omni-directional. Because, to\nmake use of high time precision, one has to delay the signals\nby fractions of the sampling period, which is about 10 ns for\na state-of-the-art 100 Msps 16 bit ADC (analogue-to-digital\nconverter). Although it is possible to implement several fractional sample delays (FSD), their number is finite, which results in a telescope having only a finite number of looking\ndirections. However, this approach may be of interest for observation of specific radio sources, such as auroral kilometric\nradiation (AKR) generation regions, with ultra-high angular\nresolution.\nGiven the 1 degree requirement and the \u00b110 mm distance\nuncertainty it is clear that the required time uncertainty can\n\nbe reduced significantly. Setting \u2206D = 0 in Eq. (6), squaring,\ntime averaging and integrating over \u03b1 yields\n2c2 h\u2206t 2 i\n.\n(10)\nD2\nBased p\non the assumed sampling period we should at least have\n\u03c3\u2206t = h\u2206t 2 i \u2264 10 ns. Eq. (10) then gives a separation distance D \u2265 240 m for a 1 degree angular resolution.\nThe above discussion is valid for observations times during which the drift of the clocks can be neglected. For long\nterm observations the h\u2206ti = 0 assumption is no longer true.\nAssuming linear drift rate k we let \u2206t = kt + \u03b5 (t) where \u03b5 (t)\nis the previously assumed Gaussian error. The variance of\nthe time error at time t is then h\u2206ti = kt/2. In order to perform interferometry the accumulated time error must be less\nthan one period of the observation frequency, or the fringes\nwill be smeared out. Hence, h\u2206ti = k\u2206T /2 \u2264 1/ fobs is required. Here \u2206T is the observation (integration) period. For\nexample, observation at 5 MHz during one year requires a\ndrift rate k \u2264 1.5 \u00d7 10\u221213, which is possible using a rubidium\nstandard. For instance, the Rubidium standard developed for\nthe Galileo satellites has a time deviation of 10 ps after 100\nseconds and 1 ns after 100000 seconds, which corresponds to\na drift rate about 10\u221214. To keep the angular resolution below 1 degree during the one year period requires a separation\ndistance D \u2265 4.8 km for 5 MHz observation frequency and\nk = 1.5 \u00d7 10\u221213.\nAs can be understood by this analysis, the observations\nshould begin with the high frequencies, when the spacecraft\nare close together and the accumulated time error is small. As\nthe spacecraft drift apart one should observe at lower frequencies and take advantage of the increased separation distance\nto keep the resolution within specification.\nIn reality the FIRST Explorer will consist of more than two\nspacecraft. The above analysis is therefore not all conclusive.\nHowever, it shows that the concept works and the reasonable\nnumbers so obtained have been used in the first iteration of the\ndesign study. The design parameters for FIRST Explorer are\nsummarised in Table IV.\nTo determine the required number of spacecraft we must\nspecify a sensitivity requirement. Sensitivity is measured in\nJansky [Jy]. It is a non-SI unit of electromagnetic energy flux\ndensity. In SI units 1 Jy = 10\u221226Wm\u22122 Hz\u22121 . From this definition one realises that the amount of collected energy depends\nh\u2206\u03b1 2 i \u2248\n\nTABLE IV: Design parameters for FIRST Explorer\nParameter\n\nSymbol\n\nRange\n\nFrequency\nDistance\nResolution\nTime error\nRange accuracy\nSensitivity\nBandwidth\n\nf\nD\n\u2206\u03b1\n\u2206t\n\u2206D\nSmin\n\u2206f\n\n0.5 \u2013 50 MHz\n0.5 \u2013 30 km\n\u2264 1 degree\n\u2264 1 ns in 24 hours\n\u2264 150 mm at all times\n\u2264 10 Jy in 1 hour\n100 kHz\n\nIntegration time\n\n\u2206T\n\n1 s \u2013 1 year\n\n\f13\nThe factor 3 comes from the assumption that the radiation is\nisotropic.

The sensitivity could in principle be\nlowered indefinitely by time integration but as shown above\nthat is not the case due to the accumulated time error.\nIntermittent bursts of low-frequency radiation are common\nin the solar system and will disturb the low-frequency survey if those emissions are not handled properly. The FIRST\nExplorer must be able to blink to avoid glare and blinking requires action in a relatively short time period. Specifically,\nusing a \u2206 f = 100 kHz frequency bandwidth, the telescope\nshall be able to detect all non-thermal planetary radio emission after \u2206T = 1 hour integration time and strong emissions\nfrom the Sun, Jupiter, Earth, and Saturn within 1 second. Solar type III burst and AKR from Earth are the strongest, in the\norder of 108 Jy. The Jovian radio emissions are about 106 Jy,\nwhile those from Saturn circa 104 Jy. Then follows Uranus\nand Neptune, about 100 Jy and 10 Jy, respectively.\nFor any receiver system, the minimum energy flux density\nthat can be detected is given by\nSsys\nSmin = \u221a\n\u2206 f \u2206T\n\n(11)\n\nwhere Ssys = Srec + Ssky . The sky is very bright at low\nfrequencies. It has a peak about 3.6 MHz where the corresponding sky-noise brightness temperature, Tsky , reaches\nTmax = 106 K. We can therefore disregard any receiver noise\nand set Ssys = Ssky in Eq. (11). For a short dipole antenna\nSsky = 2kB Tsky /Adipole so that\n2kB Tsky\nSmin = \u221a\n.\n\u2206 f \u2206T Adipole\n\n(12)\n\nThe effective area of a (Hertzian) dipole is Adipole = 3\u03bb 2 /8\u03c0\nbut between 1 MHz and 100 MHz, Tsky is empirically\nfound to be proportional to \u03bb 2.55 [Cane 1978], i.e., Tsky =\nTmax (\u03bb /\u03bbmax )2.55 , with \u03bbmax = 83 m. Hence Smin will vary\nas \u03bb 0.55 in this frequency range. The FIRST Explorer formation will consist of N spacecraft where each spacecraft has a\nvector antenna. The dipole area in Eq. (12) must therefore be\nreplaced by the corresponding expression for an N element array of vector antennas, which we take as AFIRST = 3NAdipole .\n\n16kB Tmax \u03bb 0.55\n\u221a\n2.55\n9N \u2206 f \u2206T \u03bbmax\n\n(13)\n\nThe analysis has shown that six spacecraft are sufficient to\nfulfil the stipulated sensitivity requirement. In Fig. 10, we\nhave plotted the sensitivity for frequencies, f = c/\u03bb , between\n5 MHz and 50 MHz and integration times, \u2206T , between 1\nsecond and 1 year, with N = 6 spacecraft and \u2206 f = 100 kHz\nbandwidth. As can be seen, the sensitivity has a quite flat\nfrequency responce. For 1 second observations the sensitivity\nis in the 140 \u2212 490 Jy range and for 1 hour observation in\nthe 2 \u2212 8 Jy range. for very long observations, 1 \u2013 2 years, the\nsensitivity drops to below 90 mJy ( f = 5 MHz, \u2206T = 1 year).\n\nVII.\n\nDISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION\n\nThe overall conclusions from the FIRST Explorer mission\nconcept study are that\n\u2022 FIRST Explorer can operate as a distributed aperture\nlow-frequency radio telescope with 1 mother and 6\ndaughter spacecraft with average separation distances\nranging from 5 \u2013 30 km in the limit, and the science objectives will actively benefit from the daughters being\nallowed to drift slowly apart in position and orientation,\nin an L2 or similar stable orbit.\n\u2022 A low cost radio frequency range transponder can use\nadapted COTS mobile phone technologies, and provide\ninter-spacecraft ranging to circa \u00b1150 mm uncertainty.\nIn addition, the transponders can double up as the interspacecraft data communications system.\n\u2022 Using a metrology model developed for this study,\nthe signals from 6 range transponders on each of the\n7 spacecraft can dynamically monitor the formation's\nmutual separations and orientations in 6 DOF; enhancing the basic transponder sensitivity by at least 15 times\nto \u223c \u00b110 mm. This provides the ability to optimally\nprocess the science signals from the distributed aperture array, operating at frequencies between 500 kHz\nand 50 MHz, and achieve the required sensitivity and\nan angular resolution better than 1 degree.\n\u2022 All the main elements of the mission architecture, mass,\npower, physical structure, data management and communications, launch and formation at L2 have been examined and specified in sufficient detail to show that a\nmission concept is basically feasible without the need\nto equip each daughter spacecraft with active 6-DOF\nattitude and position control. Useful science gathering\noperations of at least 1 to 2 years appears feasible.\nPotential key benefits of the mission and the study are that\n\n\f14\n\u2022 FIRST Explorer can provide a unique insight into the\nlow-frequency Universe at frequencies not available to\nEarth based radio telescopes. It could also give more\ndetailed maps of the low-frequency Sun and perform\nlong-term observations of non-thermal planetary radio\nemissions, providing dynamic radio spectra of all the\nradio planets and may even be able to prove the dark\nages hypothesis. The mission concept therefore stands\non its own against competitor space science missions.\n\u2022 FIRST Explorer can be a pathfinder for the concepts\nneeded to plan future \"grand science\" missions, with\nlarger formations that could image the early universe\nand directly detect Earth-like extra-solar planets, providing valuable complementary science benefits above\nother more expensive mission concepts.\n\u2022 The novel aspect of the FIRST Explorer is the unique\ncombination of existing technologies to offer the\nprospect for a cost-effective multi-spacecraft science\nmission together with advanced metrology modelling\nconcepts, and the approach could be translated to enable\nother science missions that use multiple spacecraft.\n\u2022 The study has proposed a novel idea for gross control\nof spacecraft drift caused by small gravity gradients and\ndifferential solar radiation pressure, using \"smart stabil-\n\nity design\" and simple passive control of the effective\narea of the spacecraft, with miniature solar sails.\n\u2022 Finally a \"metrology model\" has been developed that\ncan predict the positional and orientation uncertainty (in\n6 DOF) of an arbitrary constellation of objects equipped\nonly with ranging sensors, that is dynamically drifting\nand evolving in time. This tool is likely to have applications in planning other multi-spacecraft missions.\n\nVIII.
