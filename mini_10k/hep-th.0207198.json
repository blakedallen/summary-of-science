It\nis believed that its solution could significantly alter our understanding of\nparticle physics and cosmology [1].\nThere is now mounting observational evidence [2] that the universe is accelerating and that there exists some form of dark energy. One possible explanation for the accelerating expansion of the universe is a small cosmological\nconstant corresponding to a vacuum energy density, \u03c1vac \u223c (2.4 \u00d7 10\u22123 eV)4 .\nThere have been many attempts to solve the cosmological constant problem (CCP). Weinberg's theorem [3] disallows all adjustment models involving\nextra fields such as a dynamical scalar field. Higher-dimensional models of\nthe brane-bulk type with finite volume extra-dimensions do not avoid finetuning [4].\nSuperstring theory (M-theory) has not yet provided a solution to the\nCCP. This could be due to the problem of understanding how to introduce\nsupersymmetry breaking into string theory models, although there may be\nsome deeper reason for the failure.\nIn the following, I will describe a possible resolution of the CCP, based on\na model of a nonlocal quantum gravity theory and field theory that suppresses\nthe coupling of gravity to vacuum energy density. The theory can be tested\nby performing E\u00f6tv\u00f6s experiments on Casimir vacuum energy in satellites.\n\n2\n\nGravitational Coupling to Vacuum Energy\n\nWe can define an effective cosmological constant\n\u03bbeff = \u03bb0 + \u03bbvac ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03bb0 is the \"bare\" cosmological constant in Einstein's classical field\nequations, and \u03bbvac is the contribution that arises from the vacuum density\n\u03bbvac = 8\u03c0G\u03c1vac .\nAlready at the standard model electroweak scale \u223c 102 GeV, a calculation\nof the vacuum density \u03c1vac , based on local quantum field theory, results in a\ndiscrepancy of order 1055 with the observational bound\n\u03c1vac \u2264 10\u221247 (GeV)4 .\n2\n\n(2)\n\n\fThis results in a severe fine-tuning problem of order 1055 , since the virtual\nquantum fluctuations giving rise to \u03bbvac must cancel \u03bb0 to an unbelievable\ndegree of accuracy. This is the \"particle physics\" source of the cosmological\nconstant problem.\n\n3\n\nNonlocal Quantum Gravity\n\nLet us consider a model of nonlocal gravity with the action S = Sg + SM ,\nwhere (\u03ba2 = 32\u03c0G) 1 :\n\u001a\n\u001b\n2 Z 4 \u221a\n\u22121\nSg = \u2212 2 d x \u2212g R[g, G ] + 2\u03bb0\n\u03ba\n\n(3)\n\nand SM is the matter action, which for the simple case of a scalar field \u03c6 is\ngiven by\nSM\n\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1Z 4 \u221a\n\u03bc\u03bd \u22121\n\u22121\n2\n\u22121\nd x \u2212g g G \u2207\u03bc \u03c6F \u2207\u03bd \u03c6 \u2212 m \u03c6F \u03c6 .\n=\n2\n\n(4)\n\nHere, G and F are nonlocal regularizing, entire functions and \u2207\u03bc is the\ncovariant derivative with respect to the metric g\u03bc\u03bd . As an example, we can\nchoose the covariant functions\nG(x) = exp\n\n\u0014\n\n\u2212D(x)/\u039b2G\n\n\u0014\n\n2\n\nF (x) = exp \u2212(D(x) + m\n\n\u0015\n\n,\n\n)/\u039b2M )\n\n\u0015\n\n,\n\n(5)\n\nwhere D \u2261 \u2207\u03bc \u2207\u03bc , and \u039bG and \u039bM are gravitational and matter energy\nscales, respectively [5, 6].\nWe expand g\u03bc\u03bd about flat Minkowski spacetime: g\u03bc\u03bd = \u03b7\u03bc\u03bd + \u03bah\u03bc\u03bd . The\npropagators for the graviton and the \u03c6 field in a fixed gauge are given by\nD\u0304 \u03c6 (p) =\n\nG(p)F (p)\n,\n\u2212 m\u03042 + i\u01eb\n\np2\n\n1\n\n(6)\n\nThe present version of a nonlocal quantum gravity and field theory model differs in\ndetail from earlier published work [5, 6]. A paper is in preparation in which more complete\ndetails of the model will be provided.\n\n3\n\n\fG\nD\u0304\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1\u03c3\n(p) =\n\n(\u03b7\u03bc\u03c1 \u03b7\u03bd\u03c3 + \u03b7\u03bc\u03c3 \u03b7\u03bd\u03c1 \u2212 \u03b7\u03bc\u03bd \u03b7\u03c1\u03c3 )G(p)\n,\np2 + i\u01eb\n\n(7)\n\nwhere m\u03042 = m2 G(p).\nUnitarity is maintained for the S-matrix, because G and F are entire\nfunctions of p2 , preserving the Cutkosky rules.\nGauge invariance can be maintained by satisfying certain constraint equations for G and F in every order of perturbation theory. This guarantees that\n\u2207\u03bd T \u03bc\u03bd = 0.\n\n4\n\nResolution of the CCP\n\nIn flat Minkowski spacetime, the sum of all disconnected vacuum diagrams\nP\nC = n Mn(0) is a constant factor in the scattering S-matrix S \u2032 = SC. Since\nthe S-matrix is unitary |S \u2032 |2 = 1, then we must conclude that |C|2 = 1, and\nall the disconnected vacuum graphs can be ignored. This result is also known\nto follow from the Wick ordering of the field operators.\nDue to the equivalence principle gravity couples to all forms of energy,\nincluding the vacuum energy density \u03c1vac , so we can no longer ignore these\nvirtual quantum fluctuations in the presence of a non-zero gravitational field.\nQuantum corrections to \u03bb0 come from loops formed from massive standard\nmodel (SM) states, coupled to external graviton lines at essentially zero momentum.\nConsider the dominant contributions to the vacuum density arising from\nthe graviton-standard model loop corrections.

The universal fixed gravitational scale \u039bGvac corresponds to\nthe fundamental length lGvac \u2264 1 mm at which virtual gravitational radiative\ncorrections to the vacuum energy are cut off.\nThe gravitational form factor G, when coupled to non-vacuum SM gauge\nboson or matter loops, will have the form in Euclidean momentum space\nG\n\nGM\n\n\u0014\n\n2\n\n(q ) = exp \u2212q\n5\n\n2\n\n/\u039b2GM\n\n\u0015\n\n.\n\n(15)\n\n\fIf we choose \u039bGM = \u039bM > 1 \u2212 10 TeV, then we will reproduce the standard\nmodel experimental results, including the running of the standard model\ncoupling constants, and G GM (q 2 ) = F M (q 2 ) becomes G GM (0) = F M (q 2 =\nm2 ) = 1 on the mass shell. This solution to the CCP leads to a violation of\nthe WEP for coupling of gravitons to vacuum energy and matter. This could\nbe checked experimentally in a satellite E\u00f6tv\u00f6s experiment on the Casimir\nvacuum energy [8].\nWe observe that the required suppression of the vacuum diagram loop\ncontribution to the cosmological constant, associated with the vacuum energy\nmomentum tensor at lowest order, demands a low gravitational energy scale\n\u039bGvac \u2264 10\u22123 eV, which controls the coupling of gravitons to pure vacuum\ngraviton and matter fluctuation loops.\nIn our finite, perturbative quantum gravity theory nonlocal gravity produces a long-distance infrared cut-off of the vacuum energy density through\nthe low energy scale \u039bGvac < 10\u22123 eV [6]2 . Gravitons coupled to non-vacuum\nmatter tree graphs and matter loops are controlled by the energy scale:\n\u039bGM = \u039bM > 1 \u2212 20 TeV\nThe rule is: When external graviton lines are removed from a matter\nloop, leaving behind pure matter fluctuation vacuum loops, then those initial\ngraviton-vacuum loops are suppressed by the form factor G Gvac (q 2 ) where q\nis the internal matter loop momentum and G Gvac (q 2 ) is controlled by \u039bGvac \u2264\n10\u22123 eV. On the other hand, e.g. the proton first-order self-energy graph,\ncoupled to a graviton is controlled by \u039bGM = \u039bM > 1 \u2212 20 TeV and does not\nlead to a measurable violation of the equivalence principle.\nThe scales \u039bM and \u039bGvac are determined in loop diagrams by the quantum\nnon-localizable nature of the gravitons and standard model particles. The\ngravitons coupled to matter and matter loops have a nonlocal scale at \u039bGM =\n\u039bM > 1 \u2212 20 TeV or a length scale lM < 10\u221216 cm, whereas the gravitons\ncoupled to pure vacuum energy are localizable up to an energy scale \u039bGvac \u223c\n10\u22123 eV or down to a length scale lGvac > 1 mm.\nThe fundamental energy scales \u039bGvac and \u039bGM = \u039bM are determined\nby the underlying physical nature of the particles and fields and do not\ncorrespond to arbitrary cut-offs, which destroy the gauge invariance, Lorentz\ninvariance and unitarity of the quantum gravity theory for energies > \u039bGvac \u223c\n10\u22123 eV. The underlying explanation of these physical scales must be sought\n2\n\nThe energy scale, \u039bG \u223c 10\u22123 eV, has also been considered by R. Sundrum and G.\nDvali, G. Gabadadze and M. Shifman [9].\n\n6\n\n\fin a more fundamental theory3\n\n5\n\nConclusions\n\nWe have described a possible solution to the cosmological constant problem. The particle physics resolution requires that we construct a nonlocal\nquantum gravity theory, which has vertex form factors that are different for\ngravitons coupled to quantum vacuum fluctuations and matter. This predicts\na measurable violation of the WEP for coupling to vacuum energy, but not\nto matter-graviton couplings or to non-vacuum matter loops. This leads to\na suppression of all standard model vacuum loop contributions and, thereby,\navoids a fine-tuning cancellation between the \"bare\" cosmological constant\n\u03bb0 and the vacuum contribution \u03bbvac . It retains the experimental agreement\nof the standard model and classical Einstein gravity. A satellite E\u00f6tv\u00f6s experiment for Casimir vacuum energy could experimentally decide whether\nnature does allow a vacuum energy WEP violation.\nEven though we can succeed in our nonlocal quantum gravity scenario to\nexplain why \u03bbeff is small, without excessive fine tuning, we are still confronted\nwith the \"coincidence\" problem associated with dark energy and the existence\nof a small, positive cosmological constant [1].\nAs a model of a future fundamental, nonlocal quantum gravity theory,\nit does provide clues as to the resolution of the \"infamous\" cosmological\nconstant problem.\nAcknowledgments\nI thank Michael Clayton and George Gillies for helpful and stimulating\ndiscussions.
