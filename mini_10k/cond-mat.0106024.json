We analyze quantitatively\nthe resonance energies, widths, and amplitudes, both in the regime where only one state is accessible\nfor tunneling and in the non-equilibrium regime when additional states are made accessible one-byone. For tunneling through one state, our results agree with expectations for sequential tunneling,\nbut in the non-equilibrium regime the resonances are broadened and shifted in ways that require\ntaking into account electron interactions and relaxation.\nPACS numbers: 73.22.-f, 73.23.Hk, 74.80.Bj\n\nIn nanometer scale devices, electron transport can occur through well-resolved quantum states. Transport in\nsemiconductor quantum dots, metal nanoparticles, and\nmolecules can all be understood within a similar framework, in terms of the energies of the states and the rates\nfor transitions between states. Here we make a quantitative investigation of the fundamental processes at work\nwhen electrons tunnel through a discrete-state system,\nusing an Al nanoparticle in a single-electron transistor.\nBy varying gate and source-drain voltages (Vg ,V ), we can\nmanipulate electron flow controllably through one state,\nor through many, and we can extract tunneling rates for\neach level. When only one state participates in tunneling,\nthe transport properties are in accord with expectations\nfor simple sequential tunneling. However, for larger voltages, the resonance energies, widths, and currents can\nall be modified by the population of excited quantum\nstates. For an understanding of the high-V regime, nonequilibrium transitions beyond those considered previously must be taken into account.\nA cross-sectional device schematic is shown in\nFig. 1(a). The use of an aluminum particle with aluminum oxide tunnel barriers provides mechanical and\ncharge stability, and allows V and Vg to be varied without significantly altering barrier resistances. Fabrication\nis done using electron-beam lithography and reactive ion\netching to create a bowl-shaped hole in a silicon-nitride\nmembrane, with a minimum diameter \u223c 10 nm. A gate\nelectrode is formed by depositing 18.5 nm Al, followed\nby anodization to 3.5 V in an oxygen plasma, and then\ndeposition of 8.5 nm of SiOx [1]. The rest of the device is\nmade by depositing a thick Al electrode onto the bowlshaped side of the membrane, oxidizing for 3 min in 50\nmTorr of O2 , depositing 1.5 nm Al onto the other side\nof the device to make a layer of Al nanoparticles, oxidizing, and then depositing the lower Al electrode. Device\nparameters are determined from the large-V structure of\nthe 4.2-K Coulomb staircase curve [2]. The capacitance\nof nanoparticle to the top electrode is CL = 7.9 aF, to\nthe bottom electrode CR = 2.7 aF, and the gate capacitance is Cg = 0.06 aF.

Insets show the\ncorresponding tunneling transitions.\n\nthe two tunnel junctions is R\u03a3 \u2248 3M \u03a9, with individual\nresistances sufficiently large that the intrinsic widths of\nthe quantum states are smaller than kB T . Assuming a\nroughly hemispherical [2] particle shape, and a capaci2\ntance per unit area of 0.05 aF/nm [3], we estimate a\nnanoparticle diameter \u223c 10 nm.\nIn Fig. 1(b), we plot the differential conductance\ndI/dV as a function of Vg and V , when the sample is\ncooled in a dilution refrigerator with copper-powder filters on the electrical leads. The lines in the figure are due\nto tunneling resonances through discrete quantum states\n1\n\n\fin the nanoparticle. Lines having a positive slope correspond to tunneling thresholds across the lower-resistance\njunction L, and negative slopes are thresholds across\njunction R [6]. The discontinuity evident in the figure\nis due to a Vg -driven change in the charge on another\nnanoparticle adjacent to the one through which tunneling occurs. This merely shifts the electrostatic potential\nof the current-carrying particle. The intrinsic energies,\ncurrent levels, and widths of the resonances are not otherwise altered, so that the full dI/dV -spectrum can be\nconstructed. From the absence of spin-Zeeman splitting\nin a magnetic field (not shown) for resonance lines I and\nII, we can identify these transitions with tunneling from\nan odd number of electrons n0 on the particle to an even\nnumber [4]. Since these resonances require increased |V |\nas a function of Vg , they are n0 \u2192 n0 \u2212 1 transitions.\n(See Fig. 2.) Resonances III and IV correspond to even\n(n0 \u2212 1) \u2192 odd n0 transitions. The large gaps in V between each of resonances I and II and the next parallel\nlines are due to the energy difference \u223c 2\u2206 between a\nfully paired superconducting state in the Al particle and\nthe next lowest-energy tunneling state with 2 quasiparticles [1].\nEquilibrium Regime: We first consider the region of Vg\nnear \u2212650 mV, where Vg and V can be adjusted so that a\nsingle spin-degenerate quantum state (state 0) is accessible for tunneling (I-V curves are shown in Fig. 1(c)). For\nthe case under consideration, in which the quantum level\nis either empty or singly occupied, the current predicted\nfor sequential tunneling [5\u20138] is\nI=e\n\n2\u03b30L \u03b30R (fL \u2212 fR )\n(1 + fL )\u03b30L + (1 + fR )\u03b30R\n\n1\n0\n\n1\n0\n\n-1\n\n-1\n\nLINE I\n\nLINE II\n\n0\n\n0\n\n-1\n-2\n\n-1\n-2\n\nLINE IV\n\nLINE III\n\nFIG. 2.\nTunneling diagrams depicting tunneling transitions active for resonance lines I-IV in a non-equilibrium\nregime.

In addition, for resonances (e.g.,\nIII, IV) in which the spin-degeneracy of the state is split\nby a magnetic field, the currents through the two Zeeman\nstates for a given bias direction are not equal [4,11], in\nagreement with the simple tunneling theory. The maximum current through the lower-energy Zeeman state is\ne\u03b30L \u03b30R /(\u03b30L + \u03b30R ) for either bias direction, and the\nsecond state then adds current to produce the maximum\nallowed by Eq. (1).\nAn interesting feature of Eq. (1) when the tunneling\nthreshold is across the lower resistance barrier (peaks II\nand IV) is that the maximum of dI/dV does not occur\nexactly when \u03bci = \u01eb0 . Instead, the resonance is shifted\nto lower |V |, by an amount \u221d T , so that it shifts with\nT . This is due to charge accumulation on the particle as\nthe Fermi function sweeps by the energy of the quantum\nstate, which limits the current at larger |V | on account of\nCoulomb blockade. Our observations of this effect (not\nshown) are equivalent to results of Deshpande et al. [10],\nalthough the data in [10] were compared to an approximation that differed from Eq. (1) [7].\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03b30L (\u03b30R ) is the bare rate for an electron to tunnel from the quantum state 0 to an unoccupied density of states in electrode L (R) and fi is the occupation probability for states in electrode i with energy\nequal to the resonance state (for a thermal distribution\nfi = [1 + exp[(\u01eb0 \u2212 \u03bci )/kT ]]\u22121 , with \u01eb0 the energy to\noccupy the quantum state, and \u03bci the chemical potential\nin electrode i). Our observations are in excellent accord\nwith this model. For instance, the tunneling current\nthrough the quantum state is not the same for both bias\ndirections, being I+ = 16.6 \u00b1 0.1 pA for V > 0 (i.e. crossing lines II or III) and I\u2212 = \u22128.4 \u00b1 0.1 pA for V < 0\n(crossing lines I or IV). This has been observed previously [9,10] and is a consequence of spin-degeneracy. For\nV > 0, electrons tunnel across the high-resistance ratelimiting tunnel barrier into an empty state, so that either\nspin-up or spin-down electrons can tunnel. For V < 0, the\nrate-limiting step is for an electron of a given spin on the\nparticle to tunnel through the high-resistance barrier,\nand the current level is approximately cut in half. By\nequating the measured currents to Eq. (1), we determine\n\u03b30R = (5.3\u00b10.1)\u00d7107s\u22121 for the high-resistance junction\n\nNon-equilibrium Regime: We can controllably tune the\ndevice so that more than one quantum state can participate in tunneling. This is illustrated by following line\nII in Fig. 1(b). This line corresponds to processes which\nare initiated by an electron tunneling off the nanoparticle from the quantum state 0 to electrode L. However,\nas one follows line II to higher V, past negative-sloping\nresonance lines which intersect line II, these lines indicate that the subsequent tunneling of an electron from\nelectrode R back onto the nanoparticle can proceed via\nmany different energy levels other than state 0. The\ntotal current under these conditions can be modeled\nby a master equation which takes into account all allowed transitions between the energetically-accessible\nn0 - and (n0 \u2212 1)-electron states [6]. In Fig. 2, we show\ntunneling diagrams depicting representative accessible\nstates for resonances I-IV in a non-equilibrium regime.\n2\n\n\f250\n\nV dependence of each conductance peak to the derivative of a Fermi function, and then converting the voltage\nwidth to effective temperature by multiplying by the capacitance ratio (e/kB )CL /(CL + CR ) for peaks I and III\nor (e/kB )CR /(CL + CR ) for peaks II and IV [4]. In either\nthe equilibrium or non-equilibrium regimes, the prediction of the simplest master equation [6] is that the peak\nshape should be a derivative of the Fermi function with\na width approximately equal to the electronic temperature in the electrodes. Our measurements agree with\nthis model within the equilibrium regime, with a constant electron temperature T \u2248 90 mK. This is significantly higher than the T achieved in non-gated tunneling\ndevices using our apparatus, 45 mK, and we ascribe the\ndifference to heating by leakage current from the gate to\nelectrode R. Line III is broader than the others at low\nV because the magnetic field of 60 mT applied to drive\nthe Al electrodes normal produces an unresolved Zeeman\nsplitting (\u2206E/kB = 2\u03bcB H/kB = 80 mK).\nAs |V | is increased into the non-equilibrium regime,\npeaks I and III undergo large increases in width and peak\nIV broadens slightly, while peak II shows no measurable\nchange. The differences are not merely an effect of heating in the electrodes, because peaks II and IV have the\nlargest magnitudes of current and power. We suggest\nthat these measurements can be explained as a consequence of electronic interactions in the non-equilibrium\nregime, by a mechanism due to Agam et al. [12]. Consider resonance line III, for which the tunneling threshold corresponds to an electron entering quantum state\n0. For V > 0.50 mV the next tunneling event, which\ndischarges the particle, may occur out of different, lower\nenergy states (see Fig. 2), leaving an electron-hole excitation on the nanoparticle. Agam et al. suggested that if\nthis non-equilibrium state does not relax before the next\nelectron tunnels onto the particle, it can shift the energy\nof the tunneling resonances on account of an alteration\nof the electron-electron interaction energy [13]. In past\nwork on smaller aluminum particles, shifted transitions\nwere resolved individually [12]; however the relative shift\nis expected to decrease with increasing nanoparticle size\n[12], so it is reasonable that the shifts would produce\nonly broadened resonances for the 10 nm particle under investigation here. Because a growing ensemble of\ndifferent non-equilibrium states can be excited with increasing |V |, this mechanism can explain the increase in\nwidth of line III as a function of |V |. The same nonequilibrium mechanisms should also come into play for\nline IV, for V < \u22120.64 mV, but the broadening here is reduced because the threshold tunneling event is across the\nlower-resistance junction, L. Barrier R quickly becomes\nrate limiting as line IV is crossed, so that higher-energy\nnon-equilibrium resonances do not add significant additional current. In order for the non-equilibrium mechanism to apply for line III, the relaxation rate of some\nnon-equilibrium excitations to the ground state must be\n\nLINE I\nLINE II\nLINE III\nLINE IV\n\n(a)\nCurrent (pA)\n\n200\n150\n100\n\nEffective Temperature (K)\n\n50\n0\n\n(b)\n\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0.0\n\nDeviation from Linearity (\u03bcV)\n\n0\n\n1\n|V| (mV)\n\n20\n0\n\n2\n\n(c)\n\n-20\n-40\n-60\n-80\n-650\n\n-700\n\n-750\n-800\n-850\nGate Voltage (mV)\n\n-900\n\nFIG. 3.

A\nline was fit to the peak position in the equilibrium regime between Vg = \u2212650 mV and \u2212701 mV, and this was subtracted\nfrom the measured positions.\n\nIn Fig. 3(a) we plot the step height in current associated with resonance lines I-IV, as Vg and V are tuned\nto follow the lines in the |V |-Vg plane. Peaks I and III\nhave approximately constant amplitude, while the currents for peaks II and IV grow quickly as |V | enters the\nnon-equilibrium regime. This can be understood trivially. For peaks I and III, the tunneling threshold is\nacross the higher-resistance tunnel junction R. This junction is always rate-limiting and it matters little how many\ntransport channels are available across junction L. For\npeaks II and IV, the tunneling threshold is across the lowresistance barrier L, but the rate-limiting process is how\nquickly electrons can tunnel across the other barrier. As\n|V | is increased, more quantum levels contribute to this\nprocess, and the current grows. By measuring the current\nalong peaks II and IV as levels are added one by one, and\nthen fitting to master-equation results, we can measure\nrate-limiting tunneling rates for each quantum state: the\n\u03b3iR , for i = 0 to 5, are (5.3, 15.7, 8.0, 16, 15, 9) \u00d7 107 s\u22121 ,\n\u03b3 \u0304L \u2248 3 \u00d7 109 s\u22121 , and (assuming relaxation effects are\nnegligible) \u03b3\u22121R \u2248 17 \u00d7 107 s\u22121 .\nFigure 3(b) shows the widths of the tunneling resonance lines I-IV. These were determined by fitting the\n3\n\n\fcomparable to or slower than \u03b30R = 5.3 \u00d7 107 s\u22121 . The\nrate predicted by Agam et al. for spin-preserving energy\nrelaxation in aluminum particles is \u223c 108 s\u22121 [12].\nResonances I and II are a different case, because\nthe tunneling threshold corresponds to an electron leaving quantum state 0. The subsequent tunneling event,\nadding an electron back to the nanoparticle, may for large\nV occur into higher-energy states (see Fig. 2(a,b)), but\nnevertheless this excitation alone cannot produce a nonequilibrium shift in the energy of subsequent discharging transitions. The reason is that only this electron is\nfree to tunnel off the nanoparticle; there is no electron\nin quantum state 0 whose transition energy might be\nshifted. Therefore within the picture of Agam et al. [12],\nno non-equilibrium broadening should be expected for\nlevels I and II, in conflict with the data for level I. This\ndiscrepancy can be explained if non-equilibrium excitations on the nanoparticle can be generated not only by\nthe tunneling transitions on or off the particle that have\nbeen considered previously [12], but also by transitions in\nwhich a high-energy electron relaxes within the nanoparticle and produces an electron-hole excitation. Broadening would then be generated by the Agam mechanism.\nWithin this scenario, the difference between the broadening visible for resonance line I and the lack of broadening of line II would follow from the fact that for peak\nII a high-energy electron on the particle can quickly exit\nthrough the low-resistance tunnel junction L, while for\npeak I the high-energy particle must exit through the\nhigh-resistance junction R, giving a much longer residence time during which relaxation transitions can occur.\nIn order for line I to be broadened, the fastest relaxation\nrates must become comparable to \u03b30R = 5.3 \u00d7 107 s\u22121 as\n|V | increases.\nBy tuning Vg and V into the non-equilibrium regime,\nthe apparent energies of the dI/dV peaks can also be\nchanged. This is clearest for line III (Fig. 3(c)), which undergoes a shift of 33\u03bcV to lower voltage when the threshold for non-equilibrium tunneling via state -1 (line V in\nFig. 1(b)) is crossed. Because we have measured ratelimiting tunneling rates for the energetically-accessible\nstates from the current amplitudes, we can test whether\nthis shift can be explained by the simplest master equation [6], which assumes that the underlying energies of\nthe quantum states are not changed by non-equilibrium\ninteractions. Only one relevant parameter is not determined previously: x = \u03b30L /\u03b3\u22121L . The solution of the\nmaster equation does predict a voltage shift (\u221d T ) for\nthe conductance peak compared to the equilibrium case,\nand for x < 0.15 it can explain the full value of the\nexperimental shift. However, we judge this to be improbable, because the measured values of \u03b3iR fall within\na more narrow distribution. For x \u223c 1 in Eq. (2), the\npredicted shift is 15\u03bcV \u2013 much smaller than we measure. We can more naturally explain the full value of\nthe shift by again taking into account that the presence\n\nof a non-equilibrium excitation can change the energy of\na tunneling transition. In the equilibrium regime, the\noccupation of quantum state 0 corresponds to a transition from a fully-paired superconducting state on the\naluminum particle to a state with one high-energy quasiparticle; in the non-equilibrium case, the transition can\nbe from a state with two quasiparticles to one, with a\ntransition energy lowered by \u223c 2\u2206 \u2248 0.35 meV [14]. This\nis much bigger than kB T \u223c 10\u03bceV, and in this case the\nobserved resonance is shifted to lower |V | by an amount\n\u221d T because electrons in the tail of the Fermi distribution\ncan excite the non-equilibrium state and open the lowerenergy current channel. For x = 1 and T \u223c 90 mK the\nmaster-equation result is that the measured shift can be\nproduced by a non-equilibrium lowering of the transition\nenergy by any amount greater than 20\u03bceV \u223c 2kB T.\nIn summary, we have made a systematic study of the\ntransition energies, widths, and current levels for electrons tunneling through discrete quantum states in a\nnanometer-scale electronic device. When transport occurs through a single quantum level, the results are in\nagreement with the expectations of sequential tunneling.\nAt large values of |V |, the non-equilibrium population of\nexcited electronic states, together with electron-electron\ninteractions, can modify the widths and apparent energies of the tunneling resonances.\nAcknowledgements: NSF DMR-0071631, the Packard\nFoundation, and the Cornell Nanofabrication Facility.\n\n[1] D.
