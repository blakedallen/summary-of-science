A practical place to begin the search for time-dependent\nstring configurations is to find solutions to the field equations which describe the lowenergy limit of string theory. The search for such solutions has received special attention,\nand has led to the study of the so called space-like branes or S-brane solutions [1].1 Besides\nproviding time-dependent backgrounds which have a string pedigree, the S-branes - embedded in asymptotically flat, time-dependent backgrounds - are believed to be relevant\nfor describing the dynamics of tachyon fields [3].\nTime-dependent configurations have an obvious appeal as potentially having cosmological applications [4, 5]. In particular, because the induced metric which observers embedded within these space-times can experience do not satisfy the usual Friedmann equation,\nthey can undergo accelerated expansion, or bouncing [6], without necessarily requiring the\n1\n\nSee [2] for early work on this subject.\n\n\u20131\u2013\n\nJHEP04(2004)038\n\n1. Introduction and summary\n1.1 Introduction\n1.2 Summary\n\n\f1.2 Summary\nOur presentation comes in two parts. In the first one, section 2, we examine the properties\nof the simplest non-trivial, non-singular, time-dependent solution. In Part II this solution\nis generalized in several directions.\nA simple solution. In the first part, we obtain the simplest solution by performing a\nsuitable analytical continuation to the Kerr solution, in the same way that the well-known\nfour-dimensional S0-brane solution,\n\u0012\n\u0013\n2m\ndt2\n2\n+ 1\u2212\ndr 2 + t2 dH22 ,\n(1.1)\nds = \u2212\n(1 \u2212 2 m/t)\nt\n\ncan obtained by the same kind of continuation from the static, spherical Schwarzschild\nblack hole [9]. Here dH22 is the metric of the transverse spatial sections, which have a hyperbolic symmetry. This solution has an asymptotically-flat time-dependent region which is\nseparated by a Cauchy horizon from an internal, static region containing a naked time-like\nsingularity.\nPerforming a similar continuation of the Kerr rotating black hole solution produces\na time-dependent spacetime having less symmetry, but which is completely regular and\nwithout curvature singularities.2 The metric we would obtain is:\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u03a3 2\n\u2206 + a2 sinh2 \u03b8\n2\nds = \u2212 dt +\ndr 2 + \u03a3 d\u03b8 2 +\n\u2206\n\u03a3\n\u0002\n\u0003 sinh2 \u03b8 2 4m a t\nd\u03c6 \u2212\nsinh2 \u03b8 d\u03c6 dr ,\n(1.2)\n+ (t2 + a2 )2 + a2 sinh2 \u03b8\u2206\n\u03a3\n\u03a3\nwhere\n\u03a3 = t2 + a2 cosh2 \u03b8 ,\n2\n\n\u2206 = t2 \u2212 2mt + a2 = (t \u2212 m)2 + a2 \u2212 m2 .\nThe observation that angular momentum can cure singularities in string theory was noticed in [14].\n\n\u20132\u2013\n\nJHEP04(2004)038\n\nproblematic kinds of matter which would normally be required. Since these spacetimes are\ntime-dependent, they provide laboratories for studying particle production, such as has\nbeen considered in [7].\nA large class of time dependent, asymptotically-flat S-brane solutions have been discussed in the literature [8, 9]. A common feature which these space-times typically share\nis that they are plagued by singularities. These can arise as null singularities, or naked\ntime-like singularities inside internal static regions. This observation has led to the development of a theorem, which states that such singularities are inevitable for a fairly broad\nclass of metrics [10] (see also [11]).\nAlthough it may ultimately be possible to resolve these singularities within string\ntheory, in this paper we instead ask whether singularity-free configurations can be found\npurely within the low-energy limit. We show that they can, by starting with a more general\nansatz for the metric; a similar observation has been recently made in [12, 13]. The resulting\nexact solutions are typically less symmetric than the solutions already in the literature, but\nreduce to them in the limit where the asymmetries in the solution go to zero.\n\n\fGeneralizations. In the second part, section 3, we generalize this simple geometry to\nmore complicated situations. We do so in several ways. One non trivial extension is to\nd dimensions higher than four, where the (d \u2212 4) extra dimensions are characterized by a\nhyperbolic symmetry. We also find new solutions by T-dualising the simpler configuration\nwe found in the first part, along the lines of [15]. Other solutions are generated using\nsimilar solution-generating techniques in higher dimensions, including two examples of\nconfigurations with non-trivial dilaton and antisymmetric form fields in five dimensions.\nThe first of these examples is obtained by applying T-duality plus coordinate rotations [16]\nto a known five-dimensional vacuum spacetime, leading to regular configurations with nontrivial NS fields. The second example applies a Hassan-Sen transformation [17] to a known\nsolution, leading to a nontrivial time-dependent solution for low-energy heterotic string\ntheory with nonzero one- and two-form fields. For each configuration, we identify the\nregions of parameter space for which our time-dependent solutions are completely regular.\n\n2. Kerr S-branes\nIn this section we construct and discuss in detail the properties of the simplest regular\nS-brane solution. This is obtained as an analytical continuation of the Kerr black hole in\nvacuum four-dimensional Einstein gravity. We begin with a review of the Kerr black hole,\nfollowed by the construction of its S-brane generalization - the S-Kerr solution - and a\nstudy of its properties.\n2.1 The Kerr geometry\nThe four dimensional Kerr black hole is the axially-symmetric solution to the vacuum\nEinstein equations which describes the spacetime outside of a rotating black hole. In\nBoyer-Lindquist coordinates, the solution is given by\n2\n\n2\n\nds = \u2212dt + \u03a3\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\u00012\n2mr\ndr 2\n2\n+ d\u03b8 + (r 2 + a2 ) sin2 \u03b8d\u03c62 +\na sin2 \u03b8d\u03c6 \u2212 dt ,\n\u2206\n\u03a3\n\n\u20133\u2013\n\n(2.1)\n\nJHEP04(2004)038\n\nThe solution depends on the parameter a, an integration constant which is the analog of\nthe angular momentum of the Kerr solution, and a parameter m, that in the black hole\ncase corresponds to the mass. The nature of the solution depends crucially on the value of\na and m.\nAs we will see, when a = 0, we recover the S-brane solution of eq. (1.1), together with\nits singularity. However, as soon as a is nonzero, but small, the solution that results is\nfree of curvature singularities. It instead has a stationary region which contains closed\ntime-like curves (CTC's). This region is separated by Cauchy horizons, from external\ntime-dependent regions.\nMore interestingly, for large enough values for the parameter a the geometry is completely regular and causally well-behaved. It is defined for all values of the coordinates and\nit does not contain horizons or singularities. In particular, we show that the geodesics are\nwell-behaved everywhere.\n\n\fwhere\n\u03a3 = r 2 + a2 cos2 \u03b8\n\u2206 = r 2 \u2212 2mr + a2 = (r \u2212 m)2 + a2 \u2212 m2 .\n\n(2.2)\n\nIn these expressions, m represents the mass of the black hole and a \u2261 J/m parameterizes\nthe angular momentum per unit mass. This metric has the following properties on which\nwe shall draw in what follows (see, e.g., ref. [18] for details):\n\n\u2022 It has two isometries, corresponding to the shifts in the coordinates t and \u03c6 in BoyerLindquist coordinates. These correspond physically to time-translation invariance\nand axial symmetry. There is indeed a mixed term gt\u03c6 indicating that the solution\nrotates.\n\u2022 It has a curvature singularity where the invariant R\u03bc\u03bd\u03bb\u03c3 R\u03bc\u03bd\u03bb\u03c3 diverges. This occurs\nwhen \u03a3 = 0, or equivalently when r = 0 and \u03b8 = \u03c0/2 simultaneously. This is the\nstandard ring singularity of the Kerr geometry.\n\u2022 It has coordinate singularities when \u2206 = 0, which turn out to be horizons of the\nKerr geometry. When a2 < m2 the metric has two horizons.3 The internal one hides\na ring singularity located at \u03a3 = 0, that is for r = 0 and \u03b8 = \u03c0/2. There is also\nan ergoregion which is determined by the zeroes of gtt , where the infinite red shift\nsurfaces are located. The outer boundary of the ergosphere is located outside the\nouter horizon. On the other hand, when a2 > m2 , the metric does not have horizons\nand the ring singularity is naked.\n\u2022 The Kerr geometry has closed time-like curves, for small negative values of r. When\na2 < m2 , these are safely limited to a stationary region inside the event horizon.\nThese properties change dramatically for the Kerr S-brane, as we now show.\n2.2 The Kerr S-brane\nIn order to construct the simplest Kerr S-brane solution we follow the steps taken to obtain\nthe more symmetric S-brane solutions from the simpler Schwarzschild geometry. This is\ndone via a suitable analytical continuation of the Schwarzschild black hole introduced\nin [7, 9], leading to a spacetime with time-like naked singularities.

The mixed term gt\u03c6 , indicating the rotational structure\nof the Kerr black hole, has now been replaced by a mixed term gr\u03c6 , indicating a \"rotation\"\nin space, or, better, a helical or wrung structure. The solution is also invariant under\nthe exchange a \u2192 \u2212a and m \u2192 \u2212m, a transformation whose physical interpretation we\ndiscuss in the next section. Notice too that we recover the well-known Schwarzschild i rotated solution or S0-brane (complete with its time-like naked singularities at the origin)\nin the limit a \u2192 0.\nThe key property of this new solution follows from the observation that, unlike for\nthe Kerr geometry, the quantity \u03a3 cannot be zero if a 6= 0. As a consequence there is\nno analog of the Kerr ring singularity for this new solution. For instance, the curvature\ninvariant R\u03bc\u03bd\u03bb\u03c3 R\u03bc\u03bd\u03bb\u03c3 is given by the following expression4 :\nR\u03bc\u03bd\u03bb\u03c3 R\u03bc\u03bd\u03bb\u03c3 =\n\n48m2 2\n[t \u2212 a2 cosh2 \u03b8][t4 \u2212 14 a2 t2 cosh2 \u03b8 + a4 cosh4 \u03b8]\n\u03a36\n\n(2.6)\n\nfrom which it is clear that this invariant is well defined everywhere so long as a 6= 0.5\n2.3 Global structure\nWe now examine the global structure of the Kerr S-brane in more detail.\nAsymptopia. As might be expected, the Kerr S-brane inherits an asymptotically flat region from the Kerr black hole. This property is less evident in the Boyer-Lindquist form of\nthe metric used above due to the presence of the diverging sinh and cosh functions. To display this region more explicitly it is convenient instead to pass to Kerr-Schild coordinates,\nin terms of which the solution may be rewritten as\n2mt3\nds = dr\u0304 + dx + dy \u2212 dz \u2212 4\nt + a2 z 2\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n\u0012\n\nt(xdx + ydy) \u2212 a(xdy \u2212 ydx) zdz\n+\n+ dr\u0304\nt2 + a2\nt\n\n4\n\n\u00132\n\n,\n\n(2.7)\n\nWe thank John Wang for pointing us out some typos in this formula in a previous version of the paper.\nIn [20], a similar procedure of analytic continuation has been used to obtain regular time-dependent\nsolutions in the presence of a cosmological constant.\n5\n\n\u20135\u2013\n\nJHEP04(2004)038\n\n\u03a3 = t2 + a2 cosh2 \u03b8 ,\n\n\fwhere\n\u0014 Z\n\u0015\nx + iy = (t + ia) sinh \u03b8 exp i (d\u03c6 + a\u2206\u22121 dt)\nZ\nz = t cosh \u03b8 ,\nr\u0304 = (dr + (t2 + a2 )\u2206\u22121 dt) \u2212 t .\n\n(2.8)\n\nHere t is to be regarded as being a function of the other coordinates, as determined implicitly from the condition\n(2.9)\n\nFrom these expressions it is easy to see that for large values of the coordinates the geometry\napproaches the flat space, since in this limit the second line of eq.

Although we have seen that the metric does not have curvature\nsingularities, in its form (2.4) it does have coordinate singularities for those points where\nthe function \u2206 vanishes, which happens when\np\nt = th\u00b1 \u2261 m \u00b1 m2 \u2212 a2 .\n(2.10)\nThese represent horizons of the geometry. From eq. (2.10) we see that the global properties\nof the geometry depend crucially on the relative size of the parameters a and m, and so\nwe now discuss the various cases separately.\n2.3.1 The case a2 < m2 : closed timelike curves\nIn this case the configuration has two horizons, which separate two asymptotically-flat and\ntime-dependent regions from a stationary region which contains closed timelike curves.\nThis situation is illustrated in figure 1.

Nevertheless, since there are no event horizons\nhiding these causally-problematic regions from external observers, it is not clear that the\ngeometry in the case a2 < m2 has a sensible physical interpretation [22].7\n2.3.2 The Case a2 > m2 : Nonsingular Geometries\n\nWhen a2 > m2 neither \u03a3 nor \u2206 can vanish, and so the geometry we obtain is well defined\nand time-dependent everywhere, and asymptotically approaches flat space. So long as\nm 6= 0 the geometry is curved, because its Riemann tensor does not vanish.8 The resulting\nconfiguration is time dependent and does not contain horizons or curvature or metric\nsingularities. As we now show, the geodesics for this geometry are perfectly well defined.\nThe Penrose diagrams along the symmetry axis (that is, for \u03b8 = 0) for all the solutions are\npresented in figure 2.\nGeodesic motion. Let us now consider the geodesics of the time dependent geometry\nfor a2 > m2 . We restrict ourselves here to the simplest case for which the coordinate \u03b8\ndoes not vary.\n6\n\nA simple closed timelike curve is then obtained by moving along trajectories on which only \u03c6 varies,\ngiven that \u03c6 is a periodic variable with period 2\u03c0. However, notice that the presence of CTC's does not\nrely on the periodicity of \u03c6 (see [21] for more details).\n7\nAs we will see in the second part of this letter, also adding other fields motivated by string theory, we\nfind regular solutions with CTC's. Although it is not yet clear whether a chronology protection agency\nexists in string theory, there are some indications that this might be indeed the case (see e.g. [23]).\n8\nWhen m = 0 the geometry is flat, being Minkowski space-time in an unusual coordinate system (as is\nmost apparent by choosing m = 0 in formula (2.7)).\n\n\u20137\u2013\n\nJHEP04(2004)038\n\ninto one. Notice that the two external time-dependent regions get interchanged with one\nanother under the transformation a \u2192 \u2212a and m \u2192 \u2212m, which leaves the metric invariant.\nThe absence of a time-like curvature singularity for 0 < a2 < m2 , with its replacement\nby a second horizon, allows a new interpretation of the time-like singularity which appears\nin the limiting case a = 0. It suggests that the time-like singularity, found in this limit might\nbe thought of as a second S-brane, (that is, an asymptotically-flat and time-dependent\nregion bounded by a horizon), but in the limit where its horizon collapses to zero size and\nbecomes singular. If a is small but nonzero, then the singular horizon becomes regular and\nthe geometry describes two S-branes separated by the internal stationary region. In this\ncase, there is also an equivalent of the Kerr's ergoregion, limited by the boundaries located\nat the points where \u2206 + a2 sinh \u03b8 = 0. The outer of these surfaces is located inside the\nfirst horizon, in contrast with the Kerr black hole case.\nAlthough there are no curvature singularities, the stationary interior region of the\ngeometry for a2 < m2 contains closed timelike curves, and this means that it is not causally\nwell defined. The existence of these curves arises because in the stationary region it is\nthe coordinate \u03c6 which becomes time-like,6 since the coefficient of d\u03c62 in (2.4) becomes\nnegative:\n\u0002 2\n\u0003\n(t + a2 )2 + a2 sinh2 (\u03b8)\u2206 \u2264 0 .\n(2.11)\n\n\fJ+\n\nJ+\n\nJ+\n\nJ+\nt\n\nt\n\nh\n\nJ\n\n_\n\nJ\n\nt\n\nh\n\nh\n\n_\n_\n\n_\nJ\n\nJ\n\n(b)\n\n(a)\n\nJ+\n\nt=\n\nt=\n\nt=\n\nCTC's\n\nt+\n\nt+\n\nt+\n\nCTC's\n\nCTC's\n\n_\n\n_\n\nt=\n\nt=\n\nt=\n\nt\n\nt\n\n_\n\nt\n\nCTC's\n\n_\n\n_\n\nJ\n\nJ\n\n(c)\n\nFigure 2: Penrose diagrams for the S-Kerr brane for (a) a2 > m2 , (b) a2 = m2 , (c) a2 < m2 .\n\nDue to the two isometries there are two conserved quantities which provide two firstintegrals of the geodesic equations.

Generalizations\nIn this section we generalize in various ways the time dependent Kerr S-brane solution\nof the last section. We first extend the four dimensional pure-gravity solution to a more\ngeneral solution of the combined Einstein-dilaton-antisymmetric tensor equations of 4D\nsupergravity, for which the dilaton and antisymmetric tensor fields do not vanish. This\nnew solution is obtained by performing a T-duality transformation, exploiting the T-duality\ninvariance of the supergravity action.\nNext we extend the solutions in the vacuum to higher dimensions: we obtain these\nsolutions by performing a complex substitution in stationary solutions already known in\nthe literature.\nWe then continue with two examples, which show how to generalize higher-dimensional\nsolutions by acting on them with symmetries. Similar to the 4D case after T-duality, the\nnew time-dependent solutions obtained in this way contain nontrivial dilaton, and are\ncoupled to two-forms and/or one forms.\n\n\u20139\u2013\n\nJHEP04(2004)038\n\nThese first-order differential equations are well-defined for any value of the coordinates\nand of the affine parameter. Because \u2206 cannot vanish, these equations can be integrated\nwithout introducing singularities, leading to geodesics which are also everywhere welldefined, making the space-time geodesically complete for null geodesics.\n\n\fWe obtain the first of these higher-dimensional examples by performing a coordinate\nrotation, followed by a proper T-duality transformation, leading to a 5-dimensional S-string\nconfiguration, involving a background dilaton field and an antisymmetric three form field.\nIn the second example, we start with an S-string in five dimensional vacuum, and, by means\nof applying a Hassan-Sen transformation, we extend it to a solution within a more general\nbackground, containing in addition nonzero abelian gauge fields. Their global properties\nare richer than the four dimensional ones, and we discuss them in some detail.\n3.1 Four dimensional T-dual configurations\n\nwhere the 3-form H3 is related to the 2-form potential, B2 , by H3 = dB2 + . . ., where the\ndots denote possible Chern-Simons terms which play no role in what follows.\nGiven any solution to the field equations of this action which enjoy at least one continuous symmetry, there is a well-known prescription for generating new solutions. The new\nsolution is obtained by performing a T-duality transformation based on one of the original\nsolution's symmetries [24]. As applied to the translation symmetry, r \u2192 r + constant, of\nthe Kerr S-brane solution, the new solution which is generated in this way is given by the\nfields g\u0303\u03bc\u03bd , B\u0303\u03bc\u03bd and \u03a6\u0303, which are related to the Kerr S-brane solution (in the string frame)\nby the explicit transformation\n(gr\u03b1 gr\u03b2 \u2212 Br\u03b1 Br\u03b2 )\nBr\u03b1\n1\n,\ng\u0303r\u03b1 =\n,\ng\u0303\u03b1\u03b2 = g\u03b1\u03b2 \u2212\n,\ngrr\ngrr\ngrr\n2gr[\u03b1 B\u03b2]r\ngr\u03b1\nB\u0303r\u03b1 =\n,\nB\u0303\u03b1\u03b2 = B\u03b1\u03b2 \u2212\n,\ngrr\ngrr\n\u03a6\u0303 = \u03a6 \u2212 ln grr ,\ng\u0303rr =\n\n(3.2)\n\nwhere \u03b1 and \u03b2 denote all of the coordinate directions except for r.\nThis transformation furnishes us with the following new solution for the action (3.1),\ndescribing a time dependent configuration in the presence of nontrivial dilaton and antisymmetric tensor field:\n\u03a3\n\u2206\u03a3 sinh2 \u03b8\n\u03a3 2\n2\n2\ndt +\ndr\n+\n\u03a3\nd\u03b8\n+\nd\u03c62 ,\n\u2206\n\u2206 + a2 sinh2 \u03b8\n\u2206 + a2 sinh2 \u03b8\n\u0015\n\u0014\n\u2206 + a2 sinh2 \u03b8\n,\n\u03a6\u0303 = \u2212 ln\n\u03a3\n\nds\u03032 = \u2212\n\nB\u0303\u03c6r = \u2212\n\n2mat sinh2 \u03b8\n.\n\u2206 + a2 sinh2 \u03b8\n\n(3.3)\n\n\u2013 10 \u2013\n\nJHEP04(2004)038\n\nAlthough our Kerr S-brane configuration so far has been considered as a solution to the\nvacuum Einstein equations, it may also be regarded as a solution to the combined EinsteinDilaton-Antisymmetric tensor field equations of supergravity models, for which the dilaton,\n\u03a6, is a constant and the antisymmetric tensor field, B\u03bc\u03bd , vanishes.

We will show,\nin subsection 3.3, how this condition can be reached, in a higher dimensional example,\nswitching on additional components of the antisymmetric tensor field.\n3.2 Higher dimensional S-Kerr solutions\nThe vacuum solution in four dimensions that we discussed in the first part of this letter,\ncan be generalized to d dimensional vacuum solutions, at least in two different ways. The\nfirst, immediate way, is to simply add to the solution (d \u2212 4) flat space-like directions\n(we will use this observation in the next subsection as starting point to find non trivial\nconfigurations via solution generating techniques). More interestingly, we can add (d \u2212 4)\nextra dimensions, characterized by a hyperbolic symmetry. This can be done by applying\na suitable analytic continuation to the higher dimensional Kerr black hole with only one\nrotation parameter, which was found in ref. [25]. The stationary solution, starting point\nfor our discussion, is given by\n4 m a r 5\u2212d sin2 \u03b8\n\u2206 \u2212 a2 sin2 \u03b8 2 \u03a3 2\ndt + dr + \u03a3 d\u03b8 2 +\ndt d\u03c6 +\n\u03a3\n\u2206\n\u03a3\nsin2 \u03b8 2\n[(r + a2 )2 \u2212 \u2206 a2 sin2 \u03b8]d\u03c62 + r 2 cos2 \u03b8 d\u03a92d\u22124 ,\n+\n\u03a3\n\nds2d = \u2212\n\n(3.5)\n\nwhere\n\u2206 = r 2 + a2 \u2212 2 m r 5\u2212d\n\u03a3 = r 2 + a2 cos2 \u03b8\n\n\u2013 11 \u2013\n\n(3.6)\n\nJHEP04(2004)038\n\nThis configuration is completely time-dependent, and regular, provided that \u2206 > 0,\nthat is a2 > m2 , just as was the original solution before performing the T-duality. In this\ncase, the parameter a, whose size rules the reg- 0.4\n4\nularity of the solution, is associated with the 0.2\n0\n2\n\"charge\" of the non vanishing antisymmetric -0.2\n0\ntwo form. The scalar field is also completely\n-5\nregular for this range of a, and it depends on\n-2\n0\nboth the coordinates t and \u03b8. The dilaton con5\n-4\nfiguration has a global maximum and a global\nminimum, and it asymptotically vanishes: it is\nFigure 3: Behavior of the scalar field for the\nrepresented in figure 3.\nsolution in eq. (3.3), for m = 1, a = 1.2.\nFor a2 < m2 , the metric has Cauchy horizons at the surfaces \u2206 = 0. The geometry is\ncharacterized by the presence of internal stationary regions, containing CTC's, and curvature singularities when the dilaton diverges, on the curves given by the solution of the\nequation\nt2 \u2212 2mt + a2 cosh2 \u03b8 = 0 .\n(3.4)\n\n\fand d\u03a9d\u22124 is the line element of the (d \u2212 4) sphere.

(3.5) this transformation leads to the following time-dependent\nsolution in d dimensions:\n\n(3.8)\n\nwhere now\n\u2206 = t2 + a2 \u2212 2 m t5\u2212d\n\u03a3 = t2 + a2 cosh2 \u03b8 .\n\n(3.9)\n\nThis configuration has horizons at the locus of points defined by the solutions to the\nequation\n\u2206 = t2 + a2 \u2212 2mt5\u2212d = 0\nor\ntd\u22123 + a2 td\u22125 \u2212 2m = 0 .\n(3.10)\nFrom this equation is easy to see when, and how many, horizons are present. One finds\nthat, in five dimensions, the geometry is completely time dependent, without horizons or\ncurvature singularities, for a2 > 2m. When this last inequality is not satisfied, an internal,\nregular stationary region is present, which contains CTC's.\nStarting from six dimensions, the global structure changes dramatically. Let us consider only the region for positive t, since there is a curvature singularity at the origin.\nAlthough the metric is asymptotically time dependent, for positive m it is characterized\nby the presence of a Cauchy horizon, that separates the time-dependent region from an\ninternal, stationary region containing a naked singularity at the origin. For negative m, the\ntime dependent geometry is characterized by an initial, space-like singularity, since there\nare no horizons present.\nConsequently, for six and more dimensions, our analytic continuation applied to (3.5)\nfurnishes a singular geometry with a global structure similar to previously known S-branes.\n3.3 A nonsingular charged S-string\nIn this section we next construct a five dimensional configuration which represents a solution to the field equations for the following string-frame action in five dimensions:\n\u0015\n\u0014\nZ\n1 2\n5\u221a\n\u2212\u03a6\n2\nH .\n(3.11)\nS = \u2212 dx \u2212g5 e\nR + (\u2207\u03a6) \u2212\n12 3\nAs before, \u03a6 is the dilaton while H3 the antisymmetric 3-form field strength: H3 = dB2 .\nIt is relatively easy to find new solutions for this system.

In the limit \u03b1 = \u03c02 , instead,\none finds essentially the T-dual solution discussed in section 3.1, with the addition of an\nextra flat dimension.\nThe charged string configuration coupled to the antisymmetric tensor field constructed\nabove is completely time dependent and regular for a2 > m2 (that is, \u2206 is always positive).\nWhen a2 < m2 , internal, stationary regions are present, separated by Cauchy horizons\nfrom the external time dependent regions. In this case, curvature singularities are possibly\npresent when the dilaton diverges, inside the stationary region, at points satisfying the\nequation\n(3.20)\n\nFor this configuration, the presence of additional non zero components for the field\nB, in comparison to the simpler four dimensional case discussed in section 3.1, allows to\nobtain non singular solutions with horizons and non trivial dilaton: it is enough to choose\nthe rotation angle \u03b1 in such a way that the following inequalities are satisfied\n0 < sin4 \u03b1 <\n\na2\n,\nm2\n\n(3.21)\n\nas an analysis of the equation (3.20) can easily show. The internal, regular stationary\nregions, however, contain again CTC's.\n3.4 SKerr in heterotic string theory\nIn this final section, we generate new solutions using the method of twisting in heterotic\nstring theory, as introduced by Hassan and Sen [17]. In that work, a class of symmetries\nof the solutions to heterotic string theory was discovered for configurations which are\nindependent of d of the space-time directions, and for which the background gauge fields are\nneutral under p of the U(1) generators of the gauge group. The symmetry identified by these\nauthors is O(d)\u00d7O(d+p) if all of the d directions are space-like, or O(d\u22121, 1)\u00d7O(d+p\u22121, 1),\nif the signature of the d-coordinates is lorentzian.\nFor our purposes, our interest in this symmetry is to generate new inequivalent time dependent solutions from known ones. Indeed, in [17], the authors applied this transformation\nto a static 6-brane in ten dimensions, to generate a new solution carrying electric and magnetic charges, antisymmetric tensor field charge and non trivial dilaton field. In [26], Sen\nderived in a similar way a rotating, charged black hole with nontrivial dilaton, magnetic\nfields and antisymmetric tensor field in heterotic string theory, starting from a rotating\nsolution in the vacuum.\nWe are now interested in applying these transformations to the 5-dimensional Kerr Sstring constructed adding a flat direction, x, to the 4-dimensional Kerr S-brane solution (our\nstarting point is the first step in the previous subsection, that is, the solution in eq. (3.12));\nour discussion will be based on [27]. Thus we start with the low-energy action for heterotic\nstring theory in D = 5 dimensions, with the other (10 \u2212 D) dimensions compactified.\nWe do not include the massless compactification moduli in the effective action as well as\n\n\u2013 14 \u2013\n\nJHEP04(2004)038\n\n\u2206 + a2 sinh2 \u03b8 + 2mt cos2 \u03b1 = 0 .\n\n\fhigher derivative terms. Then, we are left with the 5-dimensional metric, the dilaton, the\nantisymmetric two form field and the Maxwell field, whose action is given by\n\u0014\n\u0015\nZ\n1 2 1 2\n\u2212\u03a6\n5\u221a\n2\nS = \u2212 dx \u2212g5 e\nR + (\u2207\u03a6) \u2212\nH \u2212 F .\n(3.22)\n12 3 8 2\n\nwhere K\u03bc\u03bd is a 5 \u00d7 5 matrix defined in terms of the original solution,\n1\nK\u03bc\u03bd = \u2212B\u03bc\u03bd \u2212 g\u03bc\u03bd \u2212 A\u03bc A\u03bd ,\n4\n\n(3.24)\n\nand \u03b7 =diag(1, 1, 1, 1, 1).10\nOur original solution (3.12) has A\u03bc = 0, and so we have d = 2 and p = 1. Thus the\nsymmetry of the space of solutions is O(2) \u00d7 O(3).

Given a solution\n(g\u03bc\u03bd , \u03a6, A\u03bc , B\u03bc\u03bd ), a transformed solution (g\u0303\u03bc\u03bd , \u03a6\u0303, \u00c3\u03bc , B\u0303\u03bc\u03bd ) can be obtained in the following way.\nDefine the 11 \u00d7 11 matrix M as\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n(K T \u2212 \u03b7)g\u22121 (K \u2212 \u03b7) (K T \u2212 \u03b7)g\u22121 (K + \u03b7) \u2212(K T \u2212 \u03b7)g\u22121 A\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\nT\n\u22121\nT\n\u22121\nT\n\u22121 \uf8f7\nM =\uf8ec\n(3.23)\n\uf8ed (K + \u03b7)g (K \u2212 \u03b7) (K + \u03b7)g (K + \u03b7) \u2212(K + \u03b7)g A \uf8f8 ,\n\u2212AT \u011d \u22121 (K \u2212 \u03b7)\n\u2212AT g\u22121 (K + \u03b7)\nAT g\u22121 A\n\n\fwhere \u03b11 parameterizes rotations which mix the r direction with the internal coordinate,\nand \u03b12 parameterizes rotations in the (r, x) space.

We have a completely time-dependent, regular,\ncausally well defined configuration whenever a2 > m2 . In the opposite case, there could\nbe closed timelike curves in the internal region and naked singularities situated where the\ndilaton, the \u00c3 and B\u0303 fields are singular. This happens if the following equation has real\nroots\n\u03a3 \u2212 m t (1 \u2212 cos \u03b11 cos \u03b12 ) = 0 .\n(3.32)\n\nAlso in this case, for a2 < m2 , one can judiciously choose the angles \u03b11 and \u03b12 , in such\na way that the metric is singularity free, although the internal stationary regions contain\nCTC's.\n\n\u2013 16 \u2013\n\nJHEP04(2004)038\n\nwhere\n\n\fLet us end noticing that the solution we obtained in this section via a Hassan-Sen\ntransformation, is actually connected to the previous solutions for certain choices of the\nangles \u03b1i . For \u03b11 = \u03b12 = 0, one naturally finds the vacuum solution of eq. (3.12). More\ninterestingly, consider the case \u03b11 = 0, and \u03b12 = 2\u03b1. One can explicitly check that in this\nway the resulting solution reduces to the charged solution we presented in the third step of\nsection 3.3, once we perform on the latter a new coordinate rotation (3.13), with the same\nangle \u03b1.\n\nIn the present letter we have identified several classes of exact time-dependent solutions to\nthe low-energy supergravity equations in four and higher dimensions. Unlike many of the\nS-brane solutions discussed earlier in the literature, some of the new solutions we obtain\nare particularly interesting because they are nonsingular, inasmuch as they have neither\nhorizons, curvature singularities or closed timelike curves.\nWe discuss the simplest such solution - the Kerr S-brane - in some detail. This\nis obtained from the Kerr solution by making complex substitutions of coordinates and\nparameters in precisely the same manner as the more symmetric S-brane solutions have\nbeen constructed from the Schwarzschild spacetime. The solution contains two parameters, a and m, and reduces to the earlier S-brane configurations as a \u2192 0. We show that\nthese solutions are nonsingular and causally well behaved if they satisfy a2 > m2 . When\n0 < a2 < m2 , although the solution is still free of curvature singularities, it is characterized by internal stationary regions that contain closed time-like curves, which make them\nproblematic from the point of view of causality. It might be interesting to study issues\nsuch as stability and particle production in these simple non-singular, time dependent\nbackgrounds.\nWe then generalize the simplest solution to include more dimensions, and non trivial configurations for the typical fields of low-energy supergravity, applying various solution generating techniques. We concentrate on S-string backgrounds in five dimensions,\nthat contain a scalar field, and antisymmetric one- and two-form fields. Also in these\nricher situations, we are able to identify time dependent solutions that are completely\nregular in the entire space-time. Simple extensions of these five dimensional solutions to\nhigher dimensions can be obtained by taking a product with additional flat directions.\nOther generalizations can be achieved by performing different kinds of duality transformations.\nIt would be interesting to understand the connection between the tachyon field dynamics in string theory and the regular time dependent solutions we have presented here.\nAlso, it is worth to investigate the possibility to construct realistic cosmological models\nbased on these geometries.\nNote added: while this letter was in the last stages of preparation, we received the\npreprint in reference [13], which contains substantial overlap with the first part of the\npresent work.\n\n\u2013 17 \u2013\n\nJHEP04(2004)038\n\n4.
