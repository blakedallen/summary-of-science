Only groups of multiplicity > 3 for muon threshold\nenergy equal to 0.85 TeV were selected for the analysis. A distribution of the events on alignment parameter\n\u03bb has been obtained and compared with the results of Monte-Carlo simulation made for this experiment. The\nupper limit for aligned muon event flux as low as 5.3 * 10\u221215 cm\u22122 sec\u22121 sr \u22121 is given.\n\nvaries from 800 hg/cm2 for nearly vertical directions up to 6000 hg/cm2 for slant trajectories\nwhere the energy threshold is about 6 - 10 TeV.\nThe telescope looks like a four-storeyed building\nwith a size of 16.7 \u00d7 16.7 \u00d7 11.1 m3 . Four vertical\nscintillator layers and four horizontal scintillator\nplanes are formed by liquid scintillation detectors\nof standard type. The total number of detectors\nis 3150. The standard detector (0.7 \u00d7 0.7 \u00d7 0.3\nm3 ) consists of an aluminum tank filled with liquid scintillator viewed by a 15-cm diameter PMT\n(FEU-49).\nIn this experiment additional requirements\nwere applied to select the so called aligned events.\nWe used the standard \u03bb parameter introduced by\nthe \"Pamir\" experiment [1], which is varying from\n\u223c \u22120.5 to \u223c 1 (for aligned events). It is equal\nto near zero values for isotropic events. Inclined\ntracks with zenith angles inside a range of 50-70\u25e6\nwere selected to make the muon energy threshold\nhigher. The effective depth for such a selection\nwas equal to 2500 hg/cm2 , which corresponds to\nmuon threshold energy of 0.85 TeV.\n\n1. Introduction\nThe muon bundle data cover an energy range\nbetween the data of direct methods (balloons,\nsatellites) and the Extensive Air Showers (EAS)\ndata: from \u223c 1013 and up to \u223c 1017 eV for primary cosmic ray (i.e. includes the \"knee\"). High\nenergy muons are produced in the highest energy part of the EAS cascade at high altitudes.\nThe muon bundle events give information on the\ntransverse momenta of the secondaries in high energy collisions, which affects a lateral spread of\nmuons in the bundles. On the other hand, the\n\"knee\" energy range is related to interesting phenomena observed in cosmic rays, in particular, to\nthe phenomenon of the alignment of most energetic subcores of gamma-ray-hadron (\u03b3 \u2212 h) families (particles of highest energies in the central\nEAS core) found in the \"Pamir\" emulsion chamber experiment [1,2]. In this work we performed a\nsearch for aligned events among the muon groups\nobserved in BUST. The first search for aligned\nmuon bundle events has been done with MACRO\ndetector [3] without certain results.\n2. The experiment\n\n3. Experimental results\n\nThe BUST detector [4] is located in Baksan\nValley (North Caucuses, Russia) at a height of\n1700 m. a. s. l. in the underground laboratory at a distance of 550 m from the tunnel entrance. Its effective depth is 850 hg/cm2 , and the\neffective threshold energy is 220 GeV. The depth\n\nThe experimental normalized distributions on\nthe \u03bb parameter is shown in Fig.1 for visible muon\nmultiplicity m=4, 5 and 6. As one can see we\nhave no any significant access near \u03bb = 1. In fact,\naligned events do exist as it is seen in Fig.1, but,\nvery similar spot configurations can be realized\n1\n\n\f2\n\nFigure 1. Experimental distribution on \u03bb parameter.\n\nby chance as it is shown below.\n4. Simulations\nA Monte Carlo simulation of EAS propagation\nin the atmosphere has been carried out. Muon\ngroups were first simulated in the framework of\nthe MC0 code [5] (close to QGSJET), which reproduces well the results obtained by the PAMIR\nexperiment emulsion chamber experiments and\ndoes not include unusual processes. To analyze\nthe alignment phenomena, a simplified model of\nparticle coplanar generation (PCGM) in the first\ninteraction of a primary particle with an air nucleus has been used. This model reproduces\nPAMIR's data on aligned \u03b3 \u2212 h families. Conclusions found on the basis of the simulations are\n\nas follows:\n1. The influence of magnetic field on alignment\nof muons is strong and it doubles the background\nfraction of aligned muon bundles caused by the\ncascade development.\n2. In accordance with the PAMIR's concept assuming the coplanar generation of several most\nenergetic particles, which cannot actually decay\ninto muons, the appearance of coplanar generation has no influence on the features of muon\ngroups formed mainly by muons produced by\nlower-energy secondary particles in further generations. Figure 3 demonstrates this: the results\nof simulations made in the framework of both the\nMC0 and PCGM algorithms coincide for all the\nmuon multiplicities while there exists a dependence on the detector dimensions.

As one can\nsee, a fraction of aligned events on a level of about\nseveral percent is normal and this is in agreement with our experimental data shown in Fig.\n1. Fig.4 shows the same behaviour for the average alignment < \u03bbN\u03bc >.\n3. A significant alignment of muons could only\nbe produced in case of direct coplanar muon generation.\n5. Summary\nAn experimental search has been performed for\naligned events in muon groups with threshold energy equal to 0.85 TeV. The measured distributions on the alignment parameter \u03bb agree very\nwell with simulated event distributions and there\n\nis no evidence of the existence of such events\namong the muon groups underground (at least for\nthreshold energy 0.85 TeV) at a level beyond the\nexpectations obtained for simulated events with\na random track distribution. Moreover, even in\nEAS's simulated in the framework of a model including the coplanar particle generation there exists no visible effect of alignment in muon groups\nbecause only a small fraction of muons could be\ngenerated in the first interaction via the decay of\nthe most energetic aligned secondaries. Fluctuations of cascade development and a huge number\nof muons produced in later generations make this\nprocess random. Therefore, the observed muon\nalignment is only determined by random fluctuations of muon tracks on the detector area. Taking\ninto account the detector area (\u223c 200 m2 ) and\nthe trigger selected solid angle (\u223c 0.38 sr) and the\n\n\f4\n\nFigure 3.
