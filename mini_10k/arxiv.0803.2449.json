If the average emission time\nof hadrons is a function of transverse velocity, as microscopic simulations of the hadronic freezeout dynamics suggest, the deformation of the hydrodynamic trajectories will change the transverse\nvelocity (\u03b2T ) dependence of the proton-antiproton ratio when the fireball passes in the vicinity of\nthe critical point. An unusual \u03b2T -dependence of the p\u0304/p ratio in a narrow beam energy window\nwould thus signal the presence of the critical point.\n\nLattice-QCD simulations have shown that the transition between the hadronic and quark-gluon plasma\nphases of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) at vanishing\nbaryon chemical potential \u03bcB is a crossover transition [1].\nThis raises the question whether the crossover transition\nbecomes a first-order phase transition for larger values\nof \u03bcB . Several attempts have been made to locate the\ncritical point, i. e. the endpoint of the first-order transition line, in lattice simulations [2, 3, 4], but its existence\nis still in doubt [8]. The inconclusive theoretical results\nhave motivated plans for a systematic exploration of the\nproperties of hot QCD matter as a function of the net\nbaryon density by means of a collision energy scan at the\nRelativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) [5, 6]. The search\nfor the QCD critical point also forms part of the motivation for the NA61 experiment [7] at the CERN-SPS and\nfor a new facility dedicated to the study of compressed\nbaryonic matter at the Facility for Antiproton and Ion\nResearch (FAIR) in Germany.\nIdeas for experimental signatures for the presence of\nthe critical point have mostly focused on fluctuations in\ncertain observables related to the order parameter of the\nchiral transition [9, 10]. General arguments lead one to\nbelieve that such fluctuations are enhanced in the vicinity of the critical point. Unfortunately, several reasons\nthrow doubt on the usefulness of fluctuation observables\nas practical signatures of the QCD critical point. First,\nfluctuations are suppressed, compared to the static case,\nwhen the matter passes rapidly through the critical region during the expansion due to critical slowing down\n[11]. Secondly, the hot matter does not freeze out at the\ncritical point, but at a much lower temperature, when\nthe critical fluctuations may well have been washed out.\nFinally, it is unclear in which observable fluctuations are\nmost promising experimentally. In exploratory experiments at the CERN-SPS, only fluctuations in the K/\u03c0\nratio at beam energies below 40 GeV/A have shown signs\nof an unusual behavior [12, 13].\nHere we propose a possible signature of the presence of\n\na critical point in the QCD phase diagram, which may be\nmore robust than fluctuations associated with the order\nparameter of the chiral phase transition. Our idea is\nbased on the observation that the critical point serves\nas an attractor of the hydrodynamical trajectories in the\n\u03bcB \u2212 T plane describing the expansion of the hot matter\n[14]. We describe below how this focusing effect manifests\nitself in an experimental observable.\nThe universality argument tells us that the critical exponents around second order phase transitions are determined only by the dimensionality and symmetry of\nthe system. The QCD critial point, if it exists, belongs\nto the same universality class as the 3-dimensional Ising\nmodel and liquid-gas phase transition [10]. The singular part of the thermodynamic variables near the critical point is a function of two variables, which can be\nmapped onto the variables characterizing the phase diagram of the 3-dimensional Ising model: the reduced temperature r = (T \u2212 Tc )/Tc and the external magnetic field\nh. In the QCD phase diagram, the axis corresponding\nto r points in the direction of the phase boundary; the\ndirection of the axis associated with the variable h is not\nknown [11, 15]. However, it is clear that the critical region is more elongated along the r-direction, because the\ncritical exponent associated with r is larger than that\nassociated with h [11].\nThe focusing effect can now be understood as follows.\nThe entropy density s and the baryon density nb depend\nin different ways on r and h. As a result, the ratio s/nb ,\nwhich is constant along an isentropic trajectory, assumes\nmany different values in the vicinity of the critical point.\nTherefore, hydrodynamic trajectories for a range of different values of s/nb pass near the critical point, thus\ncausing the focusing effect.\nThe extent of the focusing region depends on the size\nof the critical region in the \u03bcB \u2212 T plane, in which thermodynamic susceptibilities are significantly enhanced by\nthe critical exponents. The size of the attractive basin\ncan, in principle, be determined by lattice-QCD simula-\n\n\f2\n\ns(T, \u03bcB ) =\n\n1\n(1 \u2212 tanh Sc ) sH (T, \u03bcB )\n2\n1\n+ (1 + tanh Sc ) sQ (T, \u03bcB ),\n2\n\n(1)\n\nwhere Sc (T, \u03bcB ) is proportional to the critical part of\nthe entropy density obtained by rescaling the expressions\nfrom the 3-dimensional Ising model. The proportionality constant entering into the definition of Sc determines the size of the influence region of the critical point.\nHere we differ from ref. [14] by choosing the parameters\n\u2206Tcrit = 20 MeV, \u2206\u03bccrit = 100 MeV, D = 0.5. This\nchoice yields a much narrower critical region as shown\nin Fig. 1. The width of the cross-over between the two\nphases at \u03bcB = 0 is approximately 45 MeV, in rough\nagreement with lattice-QCD results [17].\n\ncritical point and then turn to the left as the temperature falls below Tc (see dashed line in Fig. 2). For our\nargument, the important difference is the behavior just\nbelow Tc , where both T and \u03bcB decrease for the trajectory through the critical point, while \u03bcB stays roughly\nconstant or increases with falling temperature for trajectories away from the critical point. This difference can\nhave visible consequences if hadron emission occurs over\na finite range of temperatures, and if emission from different points along the trajectory can be discriminated. For\ninstance, the ratio \u03bcB /T monotonically increases below\nTc along the \"normal\" (solid or dash-dotted) trajectories\nin Fig. 2, implying a falling antiproton-to-proton (p\u0304/p)\nratio. On the other hand, the dashed trajectory in Fig. 2\nimplies an approximately constant or even slightly decreasing value of \u03bcB /T and thus a rising p\u0304/p ratio as the\ntemperature falls below Tc .\n\n220\n200\n180\n\nT (MeV)\n\ntions. At the moment this information is not available,\nas the location and even the existence of the critical point\nin QCD are not established. Model studies in simplified\ntheories suggest that the size of the attractive region is\nsensitive to calculational details [16]. Here we will simply assume that the critical region is sufficiently large to\ninduce a significant focusing effect. We use the model of\nNonaka and Asakawa [14] to describe the influence of the\ncritical point on the thermodynamic variables. In this\nmodel the entropy density is obtained by interpolation\nbetween the entropy densities sH , sQ of the hadronic and\nquark phase as\n\n160\n140\n120\n\n200\n\n100\n80\n\nT (MeV)\n\n160\n\n0\n\n200\n\n400\n\n600\n\nB\n\n(MeV)\n\nQCD Critical Point\n\n120\n80\n40\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n500\n\u03bcB (MeV)\n\n600\n\n700\n\nFIG. 1: Critical region in the \u03bcB \u2212 T plane.

The thin lines to the left indicate the contours\nof equal values of the cross-over parameter tanh Sc between\n\u22120.8 and +0.8 in increments of 0.2.\n\nThe main characteristic of the fireball evolution in the\npresence of a critical point is that hydrodynamical trajectories, which would normally tilt to the right after\ncrossing the phase boundary (see solid line in Fig. 2 for\na smooth cross-over or the dash-dotted line for a firstorder transition), make a detour into the vicinity of the\n\n800\n\n1000\n\nFIG. 2: Hydrodynamical trajectories in the QCD phase diagram with and without the presence of a critical point.

In Fig. 3 we show\nthe p\u0304/p ratio along the three trajectories shown in Fig. 2\nas a function of the entropy density between Tc and the\nchemical freeze-out point, which has been determined to\nlie at (\u03bcch , Tch ) \u2248 (400, 145) MeV by a statistical model\nfit to experimental data [22]. As anticipated, the p\u0304/p\nratio falls or remains constant between the phase boundary and chemical freeze-out for the \"normal\" trajectories\n(solid and dash-dotted lines), but rises for the trajectory\n\n\f3\ndeformed by the presence of the critical point (dashed\nline).\n0.006\n\nanti-p/p ratio\n\n0.005\n0.004\n0.003\n0.002\n\nnary hadronic reactions are commonly used to describe\nthe freeze-out and break-up of the fireball produced in\nrelativistic heavy-ion collisions into hadrons. Utilizing\nthe UrQMD model, we have calculated central Au+Au\ncollisions at a fixed target energy of 40 GeV/A, which\nmay lead to conditions for which the matter passes near\nthe QCD critical point. We then determined the last\ntime of interaction in the medium (\"emission time\") for\nall final-state (anti-)protons. In order to discriminate\nbetween slow and fast hadrons, we choose two transverse velocity windows: \u03b2T < 0.25 for slow hadrons and\n0.5 < \u03b2T < 0.75 for fast hadrons, respectively.\n\n0.001\n0.0\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n3\n\nentropy density (GeV )\nFIG. 3: Antiproton-to-proton ratio along the trajectories\nshown in Fig. 2 as a function of the entropy density.

The location of the chemical\nfreeze-out point (\u03bcch , Tch ) deduced from experimental data is\nindicated by the open and solid squares. Note that the p\u0304/p\nratio fonly rises for the trajectory deformed by the critical\npoint.\n\nWe next discuss how baryon emission from different\npoints along the hydrodynamical trajectory may be distinguished. We first note that data from Au+Au collisions at RHIC have been explained by the assumption\nthat the emission of hadrons with intermediate transverse momentum (pT \u223c 2 \u2212 5 GeV/c) occurs at the\nphase boundary by recombination of constituent quarks\n[18, 19]. Bulk freeze-out of hadrons, on the other hand,\noccurs when the mean free path of hadrons becomes comparable to the size of the fireball. The mean free path\nrelevant to transport properties generally grows with increasing hadron momentum. This implies that hadrons\nwith large transverse momentum should freeze out earlier, on average, than hadrons with a small transverse momentum. In the extreme, intermediate pT hadrons may\nbe produced at or near the phase boundary. This effect\ncan also be understood by invoking detailed balance. A\nhighly energetic hadron, impinging onto the fireball from\nthe outside, would penetrate deeper into the matter than\na low-energy hadron. Conversely, energetic hadrons will\nbe emitted, on average from deeper inside the matter and\nthus earlier than low-energy hadrons.\nThe differential emission of baryons as a function of\ntransverse momentum can be analyzed quantitatively\nin the framework of a microscopic hadron transport\nmodel, e. g. UrQMD [20, 21]. Such transport models\nbased on relativistic Boltzmann dynamics involving bi-\n\nFIG. 4: Top: UrQMD predictions for the emission time (last\ninteraction time) distribution of protons and antiprotons in\ncentral Au+Au collisions at 40 GeV/A. The emission time\ndistributions are shown separately for the kinematic windows\n\u03b2T < 0.25 and 0.5 < \u03b2T < 0.75. Fast particles are emitted on\naverage significantly earlier than slow particles. Bottom: p\u0304/p\nratio as a function of transverse velocity \u03b2T .\n\nThe distribution of emission times (counting from the\nmoment of full overlap of the colliding nuclei) for fast\n(anti-)protons is shown in the top frame of Fig. 4 compared to the emission time distribution for slow (anti)protons. The emission of protons and antiprotons in the\n\n\f4\n0.5 < \u03b2T < 0.75 window is clearly correlated with early\nemission times and occurs approximately 4-5 fm/c earlier than for slow (anti-)protons. The average emission\ntimes for fast protons and antiprotons are 19.5\u00b10.02 and\n16.5\u00b10.06 fm/c, respectively, compared to 22.9\u00b10.01 and\n21.2 \u00b1 0.2 fm/c for slow moving protons and antiprotons.\nThe bottom frame of Fig. 4 confirms the expectation\nfrom the solid line in Fig. 3, that the p\u0304/p ratio should\nrise as a function of \u03b2T in the absence of a critical point.\nBecause the UrQMD calculation does not include finitedensity corrections to the p+ p\u0304 annihilation cross section,\nthe overall value of the ratio should not be compared with\nexperiment. We also note that UrQMD does not contain\nany physics related to the QCD phase transition and only\nserves here as a model to study the correlation between\nemission time and transverse velocity. We expect the observed correlation to persist in the presence of a critical\npoint. The fall in the p\u0304/p ratio for \u03b2T > 0.8 is due to kinematical constraints on the p\u0304 production and independent\nof collision size and energy. Since only a very small fraction of the baryon yield resides in the \u03b2T > 0.75 range we\nhave selected the 0.5 < \u03b2T < 0.75 range as representative\nfor high \u03b2T and early freeze-out nucleons.\nA search of existing data revealed that the p\u0304/p ratio in\nPb+Pb collisions at the CERN-SPS has been measured\nas a function of beam energy by the NA49 collaboration, which has published proton and antiproton spectra\nfor fixed-target beam energies of 20, 30, 40, 80, and 158\nGeV/A [23]. Interestingly, the antiproton spectrum measured at 40 GeV/A exhibits an anomaly. Whereas the exponential slope of the antiproton spectrum is flatter than\nthe slope of the proton spectrum at other beam energies,\nit is slightly steeper at 40 GeV/A. A flatter antiproton\nspectrum is compatible with differential chemical freezeout on a trajectory similar to the solid or dash-dotted\ntrajectories shown in Fig. 2, while a steeper spectrum\nwould require a trajectory of the type expected in the\nvicinity of the critical point (similar to the dashed line in\nFig. 2). The relative suppression of antiprotons at large\ntransverse momentum is clearly visible in the spectrum\nitself (see Fig. 3 in ref. [23]). The size of the statistical\nerrors of the measurement does not permit a firm conclusion about this anomaly, but it is certainly compatible\nwith the arguments presented here.\nIn summary, we have shown that the evolution of\nthe p\u0304/p ratio along isentropic curves between the phase\nboundary in the QCD phase diagram and the chemical\nfreeze-out point is strongly dependent on the presence or\nabsence of a critical point. When a critical point exists,\nthe isentropic trajectory approximately corresponding to\nhydrodynamical expansion is deformed, and the p\u0304/p ratio grows during the approach to chemical freeze-out. If\nnucleons of high transverse momentum are chemically\nfrozen out earlier than the slow nucleons, as it is suggested by microscopic simulations of hadronic dynamics,\nthis result will translate into a p\u0304/p ratio that falls with\n\nincreasing transverse momentum instead of a rise or flat\nbehavior in scenarios without critical point. This behavior would only occur at those beam energies, for which\nthe fireball reaches the critical point. Depending on the\nactual size of the attractive region around the critical\npoint, the search for an anomaly in the yT dependence of\nthe p\u0304/p ratio may require small beam energy steps. Note\nthat the location of the critical point in our model study\nwas chosen such that it is encountered by the hydrodynamical trajectory for conditions reached for a beam energy of 40 GeV/A and a fixed-target. For a different location of the critical point, similar behavior would occur\nat other beam energies.\nAcknowledgments: This work was supported in part\nby grants from the U. S.
