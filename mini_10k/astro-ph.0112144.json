About 100 steep spectrum radio sources from the RATAN\u2013\n600 RC catalog were mapped by the VLA and identified with optical\nobjects down to 24m \u201325m in the R band using the 6 m telescope. An\nupdated list of calibrators with known redshifts of the same class RGs\nwas compiled to evaluate the accuracy of photometric redshifts estimates.\nBVRI photometry for 60 RC objects was performed with the 6 m telescope, and by standard model fitting we have estimated colour redshifts\nand ages of stellar population of host gE galaxies. The mean redshift\nof FRII RGs from the RC list happened to be \u22481. Several objects were\nfound in which active star formation began in the first billion years after\nthe Big Bang.\nCatalogue of 1145 radio sources has been obtained in the RATAN\u2013600\n\"Cold\" (RC) survey carried out in 1980\u20131988 with the radio telescope RATAN\u2013\n600 in a strip of sky, 24h long and 0\u25e6 .6 wide (\u03b4 \u2248 +5\u25e6 ), at 6 frequencies from 1\nto 22 GHz with a sensitivity of about 3 mJy at 3.9 GHz.\nTo select candidates to distant radio galaxies (RGs) in the \"Big Trio\"\nproject (RATAN\u2212VLA\u2212SAO 6 m) we used the most distant population of radio\nsources in the 10\u201350 mJy range, where the log(N/N0 ) \u2212 log(S) curve has a maximum slope, and did selection of about 100 steep spectrum (SS) radio sources\n(\u03b1 \u2265 0.9).\nAt the following stages we did selection of the FRII type RGs with the\nVLA maps and optical identification and photometry with the 6 m telescope.\n65 objects look like FRII and about 20 of them belong presumably to the most\ndistant generation of RGs. 19 objects were classified as quasars by their stellar\nappearance on CCD images. Apart from the normal FRII RG class, some objects\nwith SS happened to be of quite different nature. 16 were not resolved even with\nVLA in \"A\" configuration at 3.7 cm, being less than 0\u2032\u2032 .2 \u20131\u2032\u2032 .0 (CSS class). 16\n\"subgalactic\" doubles, with sizes less than 4\u2032\u2032 , are of separate interest. A few of\nthem are very complex and can not be considered as young progenitors of FRII\nobjects.\nThe technique of multicolour photometry has became in the past few years\nas the main method in selecting candidates to distant galaxies, and the only\napproach at very high redshifts. Determination of the age of high redshift stellar\n1\n\n\f2\n\nVerkhodanov et al.\n\nsystems may be the only way of estimation of first galaxies formation redshift if\nstar formation begins at redshifts larger than z of secondary ionization. Direct\nobservation of protogalaxies predicted by some recent computer simulations is\nnot possible.\nThe method of multicolour photometry was checked on a sample of 45 radio\ngalaxies published in literature and carefully selected as steep spectrum high z\nobjects of the FRII type (Verkhodanov et al., 1999). It was shown that BV RI\ncolours are sufficient for accurate estimation of z and age in the redshift range\nof 0.5\u20133.5.\nWe have implemented this approach for 60 FRII and CSS radio galaxies\nof the RC catalogue that had been observed in B, V, Rc , Ic bands in 1994\u20131998\nwith CCD camera on the 6 m telescope. (Our sample of SS radio galaxies is now\nthe largest one with the four-band optical photometry.) The data were used to\nestimate colour photometric redshifts and ages of host galaxies by comparison\nwith the PEGASE (Fioc and Rocca-Volmerange, 1997) and GISSEL'98 (Bruzual\nand Charlot, 1993) models of evolution of spectral energy distribution (SED).\nFor few typical cases the reality of the colour z determinations was confirmed\nspectroscopically (Dodonov et al., 1999).\n\u2022 It was shown photometric redshifts give tolerable (10\u201320% err) agreement\nwith spectral ones for powerful RGs.\n\u2022 A redshift\u2013magnitude diagram shows much larger dispersion at mR \u226522m .\n\u2022 Distribution by z of our objects has a maximum at z \u223c 1, i.e. near the\nmaximum Universe activity stage, and \u223c10 objects at z>2.5.\n\u2022 A galaxy age is model-dependent and detected uncertainly (in limits of\n0.5\u201310 Gyr). One can point a low limit of galaxy age and, since, z of its\nformation. This age is always larger than standard estimation of radio\nsource lifetime.\nThe mean multicolour (BV RI) age of the stellar population of the RC\nradio source host galaxies is of order of 1 Gyr, and at least in some objects\nactive star formation had begun in the first Gyr after the Big Bang. Such\ndistant objects must be of high density contrast and modern cosmology has to\nexplain this very early appearance of dense and massive (Tera\u2013solar masses)\nprotogalaxies, with quickly formed massive black holes inside them to produce\nFRII structures. \u00bfFrom our 100 square degree area sample we can estimate that\nmore than 10000 very early objects, born before the QSO epoch, are available on\nthe sky and accessible for present-day optical and radio facilities. They can help\nus to penetrate into the \"Dark Age\" of the Universe, between the recombination\nepoch and the epoch of appearance of QSOs.\nFuture activity connected with the \"Big Trio\" project will be concentrated\non the direct spectroscopy of the most probable candidates to the first galaxy\ngeneration selected from our RC list.\n\n\f"}
