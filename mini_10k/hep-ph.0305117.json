YU. ILLARIONOV AND G. I. LYKASOV\nJoint Institute for Nuclear Research,\n141980 Dubna, Moscow region, Russia\nWe analyze the open charm production in the binary \u03c0 p \u2192 D\u0304 \u039bc and \u03c0(\u03c1) J/\u03c8\nreactions within the Regge theory including the absorption corrections. The calculations show that the total cross section is about a few \u03bcb for the first processes\nand a few mb for the second reactions at energy close to the threshold. Then it\ndecreases with increasing energy according to the true Regge asymptotics.\n\nIn the last decade the problem of searching for a quark\u2013gluon plasma\n(QGP) has been rising in line with the development of new experimental\nfacilities 1 . For instance, the J/\u03c8-meson plays a key role in the context of a\nphase transition to the QGP where charmonium (cc\u0304) states should no longer\nbe formed due to color screening. However, the suppression of the J/\u03c8 and\n\u03c8 \u2032 mesons in the high-density phase of nucleus\u2013nucleus collisions might\nalso be attributed to inelastic comover scattering, (see, for example, 2,3\nand references therein) provided that the corresponding J/\u03c8-hadron cross\nsections are in the order of a few mb 4,5,6 . Present theoretical estimates\ndiffer by more than an order of magnitude, especially with respect to J/\u03c8meson scattering, so that the question of charmonium suppression is not yet\nsettled. Moreover, the calculation of these cross sections within the chiral\nLagrangian approach results in their constant or slowly increasing energy\ndependence 4,5,6 , which contradicts the true Regge asymptotics predicting\nthe decreasing one when the energy increases. The inclusion of the meson\nstructure and the introduction of the meson form factors in this Lagrangian\nmodel leads to a big uncertainty for the shape and magnitude of the J/\u03c8\nbreakup cross sections by mesons.\nThe amplitude of the reaction in question has to satisfy the Regge\nasymptotics at large s. In Refs. 7,8 the cross section of the reaction\n\u03c0 N \u2192 D\u0304(D\u0304\u2217 ) \u039bc was estimated within the framework of the Quark\u2013Gluon\nString Model (QGSM) developed in Ref. 9 . The QGSM is a nonperturba1\n\n\fOctober 29, 2018\n\n7:14\n\nWSPC/Trim Size: 9in x 6in for Proceedings\n\nLykIllar\n\n2\n\ntive approach based on the ideas of a topological 1/N expansion in QCD\nand on the Regge theory.\nWe apply such an approach to the analysis of the processes like \u03c0 N \u2192\nD\u0304 \u039bc (\u03a3c ) and \u03c0(\u03c1) J/\u03c8 \u2192 D\u0304D\u2217 (D\u0304\u2217 D\u2217 , D\u0304D). The amplitude for such reactions corresponding to the planar graph with u and c\u0304 quark exchange in\nthe t channel can be written as (see Ref. 7 and 8 )\ng02 /4\u03c0\n\nM(s, t) = CI g02 F (t) (s/s0 )\u03b1uc\u0304 (t)\u22121 (s/s\u0304) ,\n\n(1)\n7\n\nwhere\n= 2.7 is\nwidth of the \u03c1-meson ; the\n\u221a determined\u00b1 from the\n\u00b1\nisotopic factor CI = 2 for the \u03c0 N , \u03c0(\u03c1) J/\u03c8 reactions and CI = 1 for\nthe \u03c0 0 N , \u03c0 0 (\u03c10 ) J/\u03c8 reactions; \u03b1uc\u0304 (t) = \u03b1D\u2217 (t) is the D\u2217 Regge trajectory,\ns\u0304 = 1 GeV2 is a universal dimensional factor, s0 = 4.0 GeV2 is the flavor\ndependent scale factor which is determined by the mean transverse mass\nand the average-momentum fraction of quarks in colliding hadrons 7 , and\nF (t) is the form factor describing the t dependence of the residue. We\nassume, as in Refs. 7,8 , that the D\u2217 Regge trajectory is linear and therefore\ncan be expanded over the transfer t\n\u03b1D\u2217 (t) = \u03b1D\u2217 (0) + \u03b1\u2032D\u2217 (0) t ,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere the intercept \u03b1D\u2217 (0) = \u22120.86 and its derivative\n= 0.5 GeV\u22122\nare found from their relations to the same quantities for the J/\u03c8 and \u03c1\ntrajectories which are known, see Ref. 7 . The form factor F (t) was presented\nin Ref. 7 as\n\u03b1\u2032D\u2217 (0)\n\nF (t) = \u0393(1 \u2212 \u03b1D\u2217 (t)) ,\n\n(3)\n\nwhere \u0393(x) is the Gamma\u2013function. Note, that in the region of negative t\nfor the reactions \u03c0 N \u2192 D\u0304 \u039bc (\u03a3c ) F (t) exhibits a fractial growth (which is\nfaster than exponential) and therefore is not acceptable. For this type of\nreactions we will use the conventional parameterization 7,8\nF (t) = \u0393(1 \u2212 \u03b1D\u2217 (0)) .\n\n(4)\n\n11\n\nAs is shown in Ref. , at intermediate energies the absorption corrections due to the elastic and inelastic rescattering of final hadrons produced\nin binary reactions can be very sizable. They can greatly reduce the magnitude of the cross section especially at energies close to the threshold. This is\nwhy we have to include these effects. We estimate these absorption corrections using the standard method of reggeon calculus and the quasieikonal\napproximation. The amplitude of a binary reaction in the impact parameter\nspace is represented as 11\nM(s, b) = MR (s, b) exp (\u2212\u03c7(s, b)) ,\n\n(5)\n\n\fOctober 29, 2018\n\n7:14\n\nWSPC/Trim Size: 9in x 6in for Proceedings\n\nLykIllar\n\n3\n\nwhere MR (s, b) is the b-space representation of the simple Regge-pole exchange amplitude\nZ 2\nd q\u22a5\nMR (s, q2\u22a5 ) exp (ibq\u22a5 )\n(6)\nMR (s, b) =\n2\u03c0\nand the amplitude MR (s, q2\u22a5 ) in our case is given by Eq. (1). The function\n\u03c7(s, b) in Eq. (5) includes the possible elastic and inelastic rescatterings of\nthe final charmed mesons. The elastic D\u0304 \u039bc or D\u0304D\u2217 scattering is determined\nmainly by the one-Pomeron exchange graph at s > sthr , therefore 11\n\u0013\n\u0012\nC \u03c3 tot\nb2\n\u03c7(s, b) =\n,\n(7)\nexp \u2212\n4\u03c0\u039b(s)\n2\u039b(s)\nwhere \u03c3 tot is the total cross section of the interaction of final D\u0304 \u039bc or\nD(D\u2217 ) mesons; \u039b(s) is the slope of the differential cross section of D \u039bc or\nD\u2217 D\u0304(D\u2217 D\u0304\u2217 , DD\u0304) elastic scattering. For the one-Pomeron exchange graph\n\u039bP (s) = 2\u03b1\u2032P (0) ln(s/s0 )\n\n(8)\n\n\u22122\n\nwhere \u03b1\u2032P (0) \u2243 0.2 (GeV/c)\nis the slope of the Pomeron trajectory.\nReturning from the b-representation of the scattering amplitude, given by\nEq. (5), to the momentum space we can calculate the M(s, t) including the\nabsorption corrections. Finally, instead of Eq. (1) we have the following\nform of the scattering amplitude including the absorption corrections\n\u2032\n2\n2\n\u03b1 \u2217 (0)\u22121\n(s/s0 ) D\n(s/s\u0304) \u0010 s \u0011\u03b1D\u2217 (0)(q0 \u2212qz )\nM(s, t) = CI g02 F (0)\n\u039bD\u2217 (s)\ns0\nZ \u221e\n\u00d7\nfD\u2217 (s, b) CA (s)fP (s,b) j0 (bq\u22a5 ) bdb ,\n\n(9)\n\n0\n\n2\nwhere t = q 2 = q02 \u2212 qz2 \u2212 q\u22a5\n, j0 (x) is the Bessel function of the zero\norder, CA (s) = exp (\u2212\u03c7(s, 0)) and fR (b) = exp(\u2212b2 /(2\u039bR (s))). The \"enhancement factor\" C \u2243 1.5 has been found in Ref. 12 and 11 to be in good\nagreement with the experiment for elastic \u03c0p, Kp, p\u0304p scatterings. So, in our\ncalculations we have taken the same value for C entering the Eq. (7).

The total cross section\nof the process discussed is calculated as the integral of Eq. (10) over t.\nIn Fig. 1 the total cross section of \u03c0 p \u2192 D\u0304 \u039bc reactions as a function of\n\u221a \u221a\n\u221a\ns\u2212 sthr is presented, here sthr is the threshold energy in the c.m.s. The\nexperimental data on \u03c0 N \u2192 \u03c1(\u03c9, \u03c6) and \u03c0 \u2212 p \u2192 K 0 \u039b0 are presented to\nillustrate their enhancement at the energy close to the threshold, similarly\nto the one in the process discussed. The theoretical calculations of the cross\nsections have been done within the Regge theory including the suppression\nof the open (K, \u039b) and hidden (\u03c6) strangeness production in comparison\nto the \u03c1(\u03c9) one in the inclusive \u03c0 p reactions at z \u2192 1, where z is the\nmomentum fraction of the produced hadron.\nIn Figs. 2,3 the energy dependence of the cross section of D-meson production in binary \u03c0(\u03c1) J/\u03c8 reactions is presented. It is seen from Figs. 2,3\nthat the maximum values of these cross sections at s > sthr are a few mb.\nContrary to the results obtained within the Lagrangian model 4,5,6 , all these\ncross sections and the ones for \u03c0 p \u2192 D\u0304 \u039bc (\u03a3c ) processes decrease when s\nincreases according to the true Regge asymptotics.\nNote, that the absorption corrections decrease the magnitude of the\n\n\fOctober 29, 2018\n\n7:14\n\nWSPC/Trim Size: 9in x 6in for Proceedings\n\nLykIllar\n\n5\n\n2.5\n\n(mb)\n\n1.5\n\n\u001b\u0019J=\n\n2\n\n1\n\n\u0016 \u0003\nDD\n\n0.5\n\u0016 0\nDD\n1\n\n0\n\n3.8\n\n4\n\n4.2\n\n4.4\nps (GeV)\n\n4.6\n\n4.8\n\n5\n\nFigure 2.
