INTRODUCTION\n\nGalaxy clusters are important test sites for cosmology and astrophysics. First, they are ideal laboratories for studying how the\ndark-matter behaves in dense environment and evolves in the non-linear regime. Second, their mass function is highly sensitive to\ncosmology, since its evolution traces the growth of the linear density perturbations with exponential magnification (Press & Schechter\n1974; Sheth & Tormen 2002; Jenkins et al. 2001; Warren et al. 2006). Indeed, clusters are the most massive gravitationally bound\nstructures in the universe and, in the framework of the hierarchical structure formation scenario, they are also the youngest systems\nformed to date. Therefore, clusters are a mine of cosmological information, a large fraction of which is contained in the mass profile\nof these structures. Several methods can be used to determine the matter distribution in galaxy clusters. Two widely used approaches\nare based on X-ray and lensing observations.\nX-ray observations allow the cluster mass profiles to be derived by assuming that these systems are spherically symmetric and that\nthe emitting gas is in hydrostatic equilibrium (e.g. Henriksen & Mushotzky 1986; Sarazin 1988; Ettori et al. 2002). This method has\nthe advantage that, since the X-ray emissivity is proportional to the square of the electron density, it is not very sensitive to projection\n1\n\nDepartment of Astronomy, University of Michigan, 500 Church St., Ann Arbor, MI 48109-1120, USA, rasia@umich.edu\nFellow of Michigan Society of Fellows\n3 INAF, Osservatorio Astronomico di Bologna, via Ranzani 1, I-40127, Bologna, Italy, meneghetti.massimo@oabo.inaf.it\n4 Dipartimento di Fisica, Universit\u00e0 di Roma Tor Vergata, via della Ricerca Scientifica 1, I-00133, Roma, Italy\n5 Dipartimento di Fisica dell\u00d5Universit\u00e0 di Trieste, Sezione di Astronomia, via Tiepolo 11, I-34131 Trieste, Italy\n6 INAF \u2013 Osservatorio Astronomico di Trieste, via Tiepolo 11, I-34131 Trieste, Italy\n7 INFN \u2013 Istituto Nazionale di Fisica Nucleare, Trieste, Italy\n8 Jacobs University Bremen, Campus Ring 1, D-28759 Bremen, Germany\n9 INAF \u2013 Osservatorio Astronomico di Padova, vicolo dell'Osservatorio 5, I-35122, Padova, Italy\n10 INFN, Sezione di Bologna, viale Berti Pichat 6/2, I-40127 Bologna, Italy\n11 Center of Excellence SPACE-SI, A\u0161ker\u010deva 12, 1000 Ljubljana, Slovenia\n12 Faculty of Mathematics and Physics, University of Ljubljana, Jadranska 19, 1000 Ljubljana, Slovenia\n13 Harvard-Smithsonian Centre for Astrophysics, 60 Garden Street, Cambridge, MA 02138, USA\n14 ITA, Zentrum f\u00fcr Astronomie, Universit\u00e4t Heidelberg, Germany\n15 University Observatory M\u00fcnchen, Scheinerstr. 1, 81679, M\u00fcnchen, Germany\n2\n\n1\n\n\f2\n\nRasia et al.\n\neffects of masses along the line of sight to the clusters. However, it is still not well established how safely the hydrostatic equilibrium\napproximation can be made (Rasia et al. 2004, 2006, hereafter R06).\nAs the highest mass concentrations in the universe, galaxy clusters are the most efficient gravitational lenses on the sky. Their matter\ndistorts background-galaxy images with an intensity that increases from the outskirts to the inner regions. Strong distortions occur\nin the cores of some massive galaxy clusters, leading to the formation of \"gravitational arcs\" and/or to the formation of systems\nof multiple images of the same source. Weak distortions, which can be only measured statistically, are impressed on the shape of\ndistant galaxies that lie on the sky at large angular distances from the cluster centers (e.g. Bartelmann & Schneider 2001). Both these\nlensing regimes can be used to map the mass distribution in galaxy clusters. Gravitational lensing can directly probe the cluster total\nmass without any strong assumptions on the equilibrium state of the lens. Further, mass profiles can be measured over a wide range\nof scales, from . 100 kpc out to the virial radius. However, lensing measures the projected mass instead of the 3D mass and it is\nsensitive to projection effects, such as triaxiality and additional concentrations of mass along the line of sight.\nGiven the pros and cons of each method, we can conclude that lensing and X-ray are complementary in many ways. In particular,\nthe comparison of these two mass estimates can greatly help in improving the accuracy of the measurements and understanding the\nsystematic errors.\nNumerical simulations provide a unique way to investigate the performance of the lensing and X-ray techniques for measuring\nthe mass profiles of galaxy clusters. Several studies were performed in the past which made use of relatively simple descriptions of\ngalaxy clusters and simulation set-ups, but still were able to assess some fundamental limits of these techniques and possibly suggest\nimprovements (see e.g. Metzler et al. 2001; Clowe et al. 2004; Becker & Kravtsov 2011; Rasia et al. 2004; Piffaretti et al. 2003). In the\nlast years, using the increasing number of observational constraints and profiting of the huge increment of computational efficiency,\nthe simulations have become even more sophisticated and can now include a large number of realistic and important features. These\nimprovements regard both the description of the physical processes determining the evolution of the cosmic structures (see Borgani\n& Kravtsov 2009, for a review) and the interface between simulations and observations. In particular, few pipelines have been\ndeveloped which produce simulated observations of the numerically modeled clusters at different wavelengths (Gardini et al. 2004;\nNagai et al. 2007; Rasia et al. 2008; Meneghetti et al. 2008; Heinz & Br\u00fcggen 2009). These pipelines can simulate observations with\na variety of existing and future instruments and include most observational noises which typically affect and limit real measurements.\nThus, they are ideal for testing data reduction pipelines (Rasia et al. 2006; Mazzotta et al. 2004; Nagai et al. 2007).\nIn Meneghetti et al. (2010) (M10, hereafter) we combined our optical simulator, SkyLens (Meneghetti et al. 2008), with our Xray one, XMAS (Rasia et al. 2008; Gardini et al. 2004), to study the systematic effects in mass measurements encountered following\nstandard lensing and X-ray analysis. In that work, we used three simulated clusters and study them along three independent lines-ofsight. In this paper, we extend that work to a much larger sample. We consider 60 mock optical and X-ray images (20 independent\nclusters for three orthogonal lines-of-sight). Throughout the paper the quoted errors correspond to 1\u03c3 level.\nThe paper is structured as follow. Section 2 contains a short review of the results obtained in previous numerical studies, especially\nin M10. Section 3 presents a description of the simulated clusters. Section 4 and Section 5 describe the lensing and the X-ray\nsimulation pipelines and the methods of analyses. We present the results in Section 6, where we first discuss the lensing and X-ray\nmass estimates individually. We show how the bias and the scatter of the mass measurements depend on the cluster morphology and\nenvironment in Section 7. Finally, we discuss our results in Section 8.\n2. PREVIOUS STUDIES\n\n2.1. Strong lensing\nIn M10, we used the parametric code Lenstool to construct mass models from the multiple image systems detected in synthetic\nHubble-Space-Telescope (HST) observations. In the region where strong lensing constraints were found (within the Einstein radius),\nthe mass profiles recovered agree with the input mass distributions with an accuracy of a few percent. Similar results were obtained\nby Jullo et al. (2007) testing the performances of Lenstool with lens models produced using semi-analytical methods. The stronglensing models are constructed by combining a main halo component and additional massive clumps associated to star clumps (the\ngalaxies of the cluster). Fundamental, in this process, is the modeling of the central galaxy, BCG (Donnarumma et al. 2011, 2009;\nComerford et al. 2006). M10 demonstrated that a wrong parametrization of the BCG leads to a severe under- or over-estimate of the\nstrong-lensing masses extrapolated at large radii. Indeed, when the central galaxy was excluded during the creation and the analysis\nof the synthetic optical images, both the bias and scatter were largely reduced. Discrepancies were seen already at R2500 , a radius\nwhich is typically 2\u20133 times larger than the Einstein radius. The parametrization of the BCG is also important for a more realistic\nestimate of the lensing cross-section: its presence increases the strong lensing signal up to a twenty percent in cluster size haloes\n(Giocoli et al. 2011) .\nThe necessity of having an accurate model for the BCG in order to extrapolate the strong lensing mass at large radii makes the\ncomparison between strong lensing and X-ray mass estimates highly uncertain. Indeed, X-ray emission from the central region\n(\u223c 70 \u2212 100 kpc) is often excluded from the X-ray analysis because more difficult to model (see e.g. Vikhlinin et al. 2006).\n2.2. Weak lensing\nThe weak-lensing analysis is based on the measurement of the shape of galaxies in the background of the clusters, whose ellipticity\ncan be used to estimate the shear produced by the lens. Details on the weak-lensing analysis can be found in Section 4. In M10, we\nfound that fitting the reduced tangential shear profile with a Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW, Navarro et al. 1997) functional or using\nthe aperture mass densitometry produce quite similar results. The measured projected mass is accurate at level of \u223c 10% for those\nclusters that do not show any massive substructures nearby. Two lens planes presented massive clumps just outside the virial radius\nof the cluster. This dilutes the shear tangential to the main cluster clump even at smaller radii. As a consequence, the mass profiles of\n\n\fLensing and X-ray mass estimates - Simulations\n\n3\n\nthese two lenses resulted to be severely under-estimated. Such problem affects the methods where the shear is measured tangentially.\nInstead, we tested that techniques which combine strong- and weak-lensing , such as those by Cacciato et al. (2006) and by Merten\net al. (2009) are not influenced. To reconstruct the lensing potential the latter method uses an adaptive grid (see also Brada\u010d et al.\n2005; Diego et al. 2007; Merten et al. 2011) and naturally incorporates the effects of substructure. As result, the scatter in the\nprojected mass measurement is reduced and limited to . 10%.\nThe main causes of substantial scatter in the deprojected masses are triaxiality and presence of substructure. Under the standard\nassumption of spherical symmetry, three-dimensional masses are over- or under-estimated, depending on the orientation of the\ncluster major axis with respect to the line-of-sight. For systems whose major axis points toward the observer, masses are typically\nover-estimated. The opposite occurs for clusters elongated in the plane of the sky. In M10, the resulting scatter of our sample is\nof order \u223c 17%. For clusters with substructure, the unknown location of the substructure along the line of sight also makes the\nthree-dimensional mass estimate highly unsure.\nMore recently, Becker & Kravtsov (2011) used a large number of simulated halos extracted from a large cosmological box to\ndiscuss the accuracy of weak lensing masses measured by fitting the cluster shear profiles with NFW models. Their results are\nconsistent with ours. Given the large size of their sample, they significantly probe that weak-lensing masses measured by fitting the\ntangential shear profiles are biased low, concluding that the NFW model is actually a poor description of the actual shear profiles\nof clusters at the radii used in the fitting. At the radius enclosing an overdensity of 500 times the critical density of the universe,\nR500 , they found that the bias amounts to \u223c 10% for both clusters at z = 0.25 and z = 0.5. They varied the integration length to see\nthe dependence on large-scale structure on the deflection field. The scatter found using our integration length (i.e. 20 h\u22121 Mpc) is\ncomparable to ours.\nWithin the integration depth we chose, the large-scale structure can be considered correlated. If the integration length is larger, we\nwill include also uncorrelated structures. Their effects on the weak lensing mass estimates have been discussed in detail in several\npapers: uncorrelated structures introduce a noise in the mass estimates and their contribution to the total error budget is comparable\nto the statistical errors (Cen 1997; Metzler et al. 1999; Hoekstra 2001, 2003; White & Vale 2004; Hoekstra et al. 2011). Becker &\nKravtsov (2011), specifically, showed that the scatter in the weak-lensing masses of low-mass halos increases more than for highmass halos as a function of line-of-sight integration length because the high-mass halos generate more shear than the low-mass halos.\nThe large scale structure has different impact depending on the redshift of the lenses and on the depth of the observations (Hoekstra\n2003).\nFinally, Becker & Kravtsov (2011) also discussed how the scatter and the bias changes under varying number density of background sources, ng . They show that as the number density increases, the shape noise contribution (due to the intrinsic ellipticity of\nthe sources) to the scatter decreases and eventually becomes subdominant with respect to the intrinsic scatter in weak-lensing mass\nmeasurements. For clusters at z = 0.25, the total scatter on M500 changes from \u223c 37% for ng = 10 gals arcmin\u22122 to \u223c 25% for ng = 40\ngals arcmin\u2212 2. As for the bias, they found that fitting the NFW functional form within R500 can reduce the bias by \u223c 5%.\n2.3. X-ray\nRegarding the X-ray analysis, we tested two different approaches in M10 that we dubbed the backward and forward methods.\nThe backward procedure assumed a priori a functional form for the mass (such as NFW), spherical symmetry and hydrostatic\nequilibrium (Eq. 26 in M10):\n\u2212 G\u03bcm p ngas Mtot (< r)/r2 = dP/dr = d(ngas \u00d7 T )/dr\n(1)\nwhere G is the gravitational constant, \u03bc = 0.59 is mean molecular weight in a.m.u., m p is the proton mass, k is the Boltzmann constant, and ngas and T are the gas density and temperature profiles. These are estimated at once by geometrically de-projecting the\nmeasured X-ray surface brightness and temperature data. The 3D temperature is computed following the recipe by Mazzotta et al.\n(2004). More details can be found in (Ettori et al. 2002; Morandi et al. 2007, R06, M10).\nThe forward method, instead, uses a complex parametric formulae to fit the projected surface brightness and temperature profiles.\nSubsequently, the analytic 2D expressions are de-projected assuming sphericity and finally the total mass is computed through Eq.1.\nThe two methods are based on the same basic hypothesis: spherical symmetry and hydrostatic equilibrium. They differ for the quantity they analytically parametrized. The first method imposes a fixed mass profile (usually NFW) while the second uses parametric\nformulas for the surface brightness and the temperature distributions (see Sec.5.2). In this way, the forward approach has smoother\nradial profiles to be derived, but also more parameters. The two procedures consistently reconstruct both the total and the gas masses,\nas we demonstrated. For this reason, here, we limit our X-ray analysis to the forward method (presented with more detail later on\nthe paper). The X-ray masses were shown to systematically underestimate the true mass of the simulated clusters by 5-20% with an\naverage bias of 10% between R2500 and R200 and a scatter of 6%. The gas masses reconstructed were usually 5% higher than the true\nones within the region with sufficient signal. Thanks to the high exposure time used (500 ks) and the field of view of the images, we\ncompared the mass profiles up to R200 .\nM10 results were similar to the findings of Nagai et al. (2007). In the same fashion, the authors created mock X-ray images of 16\nobjects simulated with an adaptive mesh code. The exposure time was 1 Msec and the field of view selected extended well beyond\nR200 . Processing the images, they followed the forward method. In their whole sample, the average difference between the total mass\nand the X-ray derived mass was 16% at R500 with a scatter of 9%, reducing to 13% \u00b1 10% for regular systems.\nRasia et al. (2006) studied a smaller sample of five objects. We follow the backward method assuming different parametrization\nfor the total mass: \u03b2 model either isothermal or with polytropic temperature profile, NFW and the model presented by Rasia et al.\n(2004). Under the condition of perfect background subtraction, we found an averaged bias of 23% at R500 and 20.6% at R2500 . The\ncauses of the bias were double: the neglect contribution of the gas bulk motions to the total energy budget and the temperature bias\ntowards lower values of the X-ray temperatures. The contribution of the last factor was confirmed by Piffaretti & Valdarnini (2008)\n\n\f4\n\nRasia et al.\n\nwho analyzed more than 150 SPH-simulated clusters. Both papers found a temperature bias of 10-15% (see also Rasia et al. 2005).\nAmeglio et al. (2009) pointed out the direct correlation between this bias and the cluster mass (or temperature): the bias is higher in\nmost massive systems because they have a larger spread in temperature.\n3. SIMULATIONS\n\nOur analysis is based on 20 simulated clusters identified at z = 0.25, all having virial mass Mvir > 5 \u00d7 1014 h\u22121 M at that redshift,\nand each observed along three orthogonal projection directions. These clusters belong to the set of radiative simulations presented\nby Fabjan et al. (2011), whose initial conditions have been described in details by Bonafede et al. (2011). The Lagrangian regions\naround each of these clusters have been identified within a low\u2013resolution N-body cosmological simulation, that followed 10243 DM\nparticles within a box having a comoving side of 1 h\u22121 Gpc. The cosmological model assumed is a flat \u039bCDM one, with \u03a9m = 0.24 for\nthe matter density parameter, \u03a9bar = 0.04 for the contribution of baryons, H0 = 72 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 for the present-day Hubble constant,\nns = 0.96 for the primordial spectral index and \u03c38 = 0.8 for the normalization of the power spectrum, thus consistent with the CMB\nWMAP7 constrains (Komatsu et al. 2011). Within each Lagrangian region mass resolution is increased following the Zoomed\nInitial Condition (ZIC) technique (Tormen et al. 1997). Resolution is progressively degraded outside such regions, so as to save\ncomputational time, while preserving a correct description of the large\u2013scale tidal field. Within the high\u2013resolution region, it is\nmDM = 8.47 \u00d7 108 M h\u22121 and mDM = 1.53 \u00d7 108 M h\u22121 for the masses of the DM and gas particles, respectively.\nSimulations have been carried out using the TreePM/SPH GADGET-3 code, a newer and more efficient version of the GADGET-2\ncode originally presented by Springel (2005). A Plummer\u2013equivalent softening length for the computation of the gravitational force\nin the high\u2013resolution region was fixed to \u000f = 5 h\u22121 kpc in physical units at redshift z < 2, while being kept fixed in comoving units at\nhigher redshift. As for the computation of hydrodynamic forces, we assume the SPH smoothing length to reach a minimum allowed\nvalue of 0.5\u000f. Our simulations include metal\u2013dependent radiative cooling and cooling/heating from a spatially uniform and evolving\nUV background, according to the prescription presented by Wiersma et al. (2009). Following the star-formation model by Springel\n& Hernquist (2003) gas particles whose density exceeds a given threshold value are treated as multi-phase particles, where a hot\nionized phase coexists in pressure equilibrium with a cold phase, which is the reservoir for star formation. We also include a detailed\ndescription of metal enrichment from different stellar populations, using the model originally described by Tornatore et al. (2007).\nThe effect of SN feedback is included through the effect of galactic winds having a velocity of 500 km s\u22121 .\nThe cluster significant radii (R2500 , R1000 , R500 , R200 , Rvir )16 and the corresponding masses are listed in Table 1. To compute these\nquantities we center on the minimum of the potential well as done in Rasia et al. (2011). In the following, we will refer to these\nnumbers as the true or the intrinsic values.\nTABLE 1\nT RUE RADII IN h\u22121\n\ncluster\nCL1\nCL2\nCL3\nCL4\nCL5\nCL6\nCL7\nCL8\nCL9\nCL10\nCL11\nCL12\nCL13\nCL14\nCL15\nCL16\nCL17\nCL18\nCL19\nCL20\n\nKPC AND MASSES IN\n\nR2500\n388\n491\n341\n314\n415\n437\n396\n404\n372\n393\n458\n317\n304\n452\n373\n400\n370\n277\n289\n403\n\nR1000\n669\n823\n558\n513\n654\n719\n656\n655\n615\n708\n739\n568\n541\n723\n608\n653\n616\n475\n513\n660\n\nR500\n989\n1161\n790\n747\n925\n1010\n934\n921\n857\n1052\n1019\n836\n868\n998\n902\n911\n892\n700\n780\n920\n\nh\u22121 1014 M\n\nR200\n1561\n1731\n1181\n1204\n1495\n1557\n1476\n1487\n1277\n1637\n1528\n1343\n1405\n1503\n1467\n1392\n1459\n1147\n1249\n1410\n\nAT DIFFERENT OVERDENSITY\n\nRvir\n1988\n2241\n1515\n1615\n1962\n2048\n1949\n1951\n1647\n2075\n1943\n1763\n1827\n1930\n1965\n1822\n1891\n1504\n1585\n1858\n\nM2500\n2.089\n4.227\n1.410\n1.099\n2.557\n2.966\n2.218\n2.357\n1.830\n2.163\n3.427\n1.131\n1.005\n3.289\n1.847\n2.278\n1.809\n7.584\n0.858\n2.337\n\nM1000\n4.277\n7.948\n2.484\n1.923\n3.985\n5.296\n4.021\n4.003\n3.315\n5.051\n5.751\n2.617\n2.257\n5.381\n3.200\n3.970\n3.332\n1.528\n1.922\n4.092\n\n(\u2206 = 2500, 1000, 500, 200, vir).\n\nM500\n6.900\n11.170\n3.510\n2.974\n5.637\n7.342\n5.807\n5.563\n4.480\n8.299\n7.546\n4.171\n4.655\n7.079\n5.238\n5.392\n5.052\n2.444\n3.380\n5.544\n\nM200\n10.852\n14.796\n4.702\n4.979\n9.518\n10.772\n9.169\n9.367\n5.941\n12.514\n10.187\n6.902\n7.913\n9.686\n9.008\n7.691\n8.863\n4.303\n5.551\n7.993\n\n4.

Here, we briefly summarize the basic steps\ntoward the realization of the simulated images and refer the reader to those papers for further details.\nWe begin selecting particles falling into a cylinder centered on the cluster and having its width and depth set equal to 10 and\n20 h\u22121 Mpc, respectively. This ensures to include in the simulation the effects of filaments apart from the cluster and of additional\nmass clumps that could produce addition shear signal. Since we are focusing on high resolution re-simulated clusters, we do not\ninclude the effects of un-correlated large-scale-structures. As matter of fact, the importance of matter along the line of sight is fairly\nsmall for rich clusters at intermediate redshifts, like those in our sample, provided that the bulk of the sources are at high redshift\ncompared to the cluster (see Section 1).\nWe project the mass distribution (i.e. the selected particles) on a lens plane at the redshift of the cluster, zL = 0.25. For each cluster\nin the sample we derive three lens planes, corresponding to the projections (named 1, 2, and 3) along the three axes of the simulation\nbox. The final number of lens planes used in this study is 60. This is a factor of \u223c 7 larger than the sample previously investigated in\nM10.\nThe deflection field of each cluster is determined by tracing a bundle of 4096 \u00d7 4096 light-rays from the observer position through\nthe lens plane (see M10 for the description of the tree-code). The final deflection matrix is used to further trace the light rays toward\nthe background sources, allowing us to reconstruct their distorted images. In short, the code uses a set of real galaxies decomposed\ninto shapelets (Refregier 2003) to model the source morphologies on a synthetic sky. In the current version of the simulator, the\nshapelet database contains \u223c 3000 galaxies in the z-band from the GOODS/ACS archive (Giavalisco et al. 2004) and \u223c 10000\ngalaxies in the B,V, i, z bands from the Hubble-Ultra-Deep-Field ( HUDF) archive (Beckwith et al. 2006). Most galaxies have\nspectral classifications and photometric redshifts available (Benitez 2000; Coe et al. 2006), which are used to generate a population\nof sources whose luminosity and redshift distributions resemble those of the HUDF.\nSkyLens allows us to mimic observations with a variety of telescopes, both from space and from the ground. For this work, we\nsimulate wide field observations, on which we carry out a weak lensing analysis, using the SUBARU Suprime-Cam. All simulations\ninclude realistic background and instrumental noise. The galaxy colors are realistically reproduced by adopting 22 SEDs to model\nthe background galaxies, following the spectral classifications published by Coe et al. (2006).\nCompared to M10, we use here a different setup. First, we assume an exposure time of 2000s in the I-band, which is a factor of\nthree shallower than in M10. This is aimed at testing the weak lensing analysis under more realistic conditions. Second, we use real\nstars observed with SUBARU to model the PSF. The PSF model is characterized by a FWHM of \u223c 0.600 . M10 used an isotropic\ngaussian PSF instead. For all lens planes, we produce wide-field images covering a region of 240000 \u00d7 240000 around the cluster\ncenter. This allows us to measure the shear signal up to a distance of \u223c 3.5 h\u22121 Mpc at z = zL , well beyond the virial radius of any\ncluster in the sample.\n4.2. Weak-lensing analysis\nThe weak lensing measurements are done using the standard Kaiser-Squires-Broadhurst (KSB) method, proposed by Kaiser et al.\n(1995) and subsequently extended by Luppino & Kaiser (1997) and by Hoekstra et al. (1998). The galaxy ellipticities are measured\nfrom the quadrupole moments of their surface brightness distributions, corrected for the PSF, and used to estimate the reduced shear\nunder the assumption that the expectation value of the intrinsic source ellipticity vanishes.\nIn this study we use the publicly available pipeline KSBf90 by C. Heymans17 to process our images and measure the shear\nfields. The final galaxy catalogs are constructed by selecting only the galaxies with signal-to-noise ratio S/N > 10 (as provided by\nSExtractor, Bertin & Arnouts 1996), half-light radius larger than 1.15 times the PSF size, and reduced shear |g| < 1. Given the\nabove mentioned exposure time and seeing conditions, the effective number density of galaxies in the final shear catalogs is \u223c 17\narcmin\u22122 . In observations exploiting a depth similar to our simulated images, the number of sources available for the lensing analysis\nmay be smaller because the light emission from cluster galaxies (not included in these simulations) are potential contaminants. These\nnon-lensed galaxies bias low the lensing signal if they are accidentally included in the shear catalogues. Color based techniques\n(e.g. Medezinski et al. 2007, 2010) allow to separate the foreground and the background galaxy populations efficiently, but, to be\nconservative, several sources which may have a dubious classification are usually excluded from the lensing catalogs. Among them\nseveral background galaxies.\nIn M10, we considered several methods to measure the total mass using the observed shear field. As discussed above, we found\nthat the most precise mass measurements are obtained by combining weak and strong lensing non-parametrically (see e.g. Merten\net al. 2009). The disadvantage of this approach is that it is very expensive both in terms of time needed to carry out the analysis\nand in terms of data requirements. The identification of the strong-lensing features, used to constrain the model in the inner region,\nusually requires deep and high-resolution Hubble-Space-Telescope imaging. Moreover, strong-lensing clusters are relatively rare\nand known to be affected by many biases (Meneghetti et al. 2010, 2011; Hennawi et al. 2007). Fitting the tangential shear profiles\nwith functionals describing the cluster density profiles is a very common and easy alternative to measure the mass (e.g. Clowe &\nSchneider 2002; Hoekstra et al. 2000; Jee et al. 2005; Dahle 2006; Paulin-Henriksson et al. 2007; Bardeau et al. 2007; Oguri et al.\n2009; Kubo et al. 2007; Okabe et al. 2010; Romano et al. 2010; Umetsu et al. 2011; Zitrin et al. 2011). Further, this method can be\napplied to clusters down to relatively small mass limits and in absence of strong lensing features.\nHere, we assume that the density profiles of clusters are well described by the Navarro-Frenk-White profile (Navarro et al. 1997),\n\u03c1s\n(2)\n\u03c1NFW (r) =\nr/rs (1 + r/rs )2\nwhere \u03c1s and rs are the characteristic density and the scale radius, respectively. The characteristic density is often written in terms of\n17\n\nhttp://www.roe.ac.uk/\u223cheymans/KSBf90/Home.html\n\n\f6\n\nRasia et al.\n\nthe concentration parameter, c200 = r200 /rs , as\nc3200\n200\n\u03c1cr\n.\n(3)\n3\n[ln(1 + c200 ) \u2212 c200 /(1 + c200 )]\nWe derive the mass by fitting the one-dimensional reduced tangential shear profile with the corresponding NFW functional (Bartelmann 1996; Wright & Brainerd 2000; Meneghetti et al. 2003).\nThe tangential shear profile is derived from the data by radially binning the galaxies and averaging the tangential component of\ntheir ellipticity within each bin. The tangential and cross components are, respectively, defined as\n\u000f+ = \u2212Re[\u000f e\u22122i\u03c6 ] and \u000f\u00d7 = \u2212Im[\u000f e\u22122i\u03c6 ] .\n(4)\nThe angle \u03c6 specifies the direction from the galaxy centroid towards the center of the cluster, which we identify with most bound\nparticle in the simulation. When averaging over many galaxies, the expectation value of the intrinsic source ellipticity vanishes, and\nthe reduced tangential shear is given by g+ = h\u000f+ i. On the contrary, in absence of systematics the averaged cross component of the\nellipticity should be zero.\n\u03c1s =\n\n5. X - RAY\n\n5.1. X-MAS simulations\nBefore producing the X-ray synthetic catalogue, we have applied the technique described in Appendix A to remove over-cooled\nparticles. Subsequently, our clusters are processed through X-MAS to obtain Chandra mock images. The characteristics of this\nsoftware package are described in detail in other works (Gardini et al. 2004; Rasia et al. 2008). To create the photon event file,\nwe assumed the Ancillary Response Function (ARF) and Redistribution Matrix Function (RMF) typical of the ACIS-S3 detector\naimpoint. We consider the redshift as that of the simulated time frame (z = 0.25) and the metallicity constant and equal to 0.3 solar\nin respect to the tables by Anders & Grevesse (1989)18 . The field of view of our images has a side of 16 arcmin. For our cosmology\nand redshift, this corresponds to 2561 h\u22121 kpc. All the clusters have their R500 regions within the field of view (see Table 1), even if\nsome of them at that radius do not emit a sufficient number of photons to allow a precise spatial and spectral analysis (see more in the\nnext session). We account for the emission by all the particles within a depth of 10 Mpc along the line of sight direction and centered\non the cluster. The exposure time chosen is 100 ksec. This setting differs from what adopted in M10: the reduction of the exposure\ntime allows a more realistic comparison with observed data. In the final event files, we add a contribution for the galactic absorption\nby a WABS model with NH = 5 \u00d7 1020 cm\u22122 . As in M10, we do not include the influence of the background since R06 proved that its\nnet effect is to enlarge the error on the mass estimates without introducing an extra bias. Furthermore, new background models are\ncapable to predict the spatial variation of the Chandra background with an accuracy better than 1% (Bartalucci et al. in preparation).\nWe note that tools as X-MAS are not suitable to address calibration problematics since the same response files are used both to\ncreate and to analyze the data. In this sense, in our analysis we assume a perfect knowledge of the instrument calibration and the\nresults do not depend on the instrument reproduced. In the analysis of real observational data, systematic instrumental uncertainties\nare highly important, in particular in situation of high statistics (high number of counts). To treat them correctly one needs to include\nthem in the analysis. Lee et al. (2011) have recently provided a bayesian statistical method to tackle this problem.\n5.2. X-ray analysis\nUsing CIAO tool (Fruscione et al. 2006) we extract soft band images in the [0.7 \u2212 2] keV band. We apply the wavelet algorithm\nof Vikhlinin et al. (1998) to identify clumps. These and any major substructure have been masked and excluded from the following\nanalysis. The surface brightness profiles are centered in the X-ray centroid (Rasia et al. 2011) and account 15-30 linearly spaced\nannuli with at least 100 counts. The innermost annulus is selected outside the central 10% of R500 , the outermost one is always\nbeyond R1000 and reaches R500 in the majority of the cases (see Table 3). The radial coverage is comparable to recent observations,\nsome of which extend beyond R500 (Neumann 2005; Ettori & Balestra 2009; Leccardi & Molendi 2008; Vikhlinin et al. 2009). The\ntemperature profile is calculated in 6-10 annuli spanning over the same radial range of the surface brightness profile. The minimum\nnumber of photon per temperature annulus is 1000. The spectra are grouped and fitted by a single-temperature MEKAL model in the\nXSPEC package(Arnaud 1996). The statistics used is \u03c72 and the energy band considered is [0.8-7] keV. In the pipeline the values of\ngalactic absorption, redshift, hydrogen column density and metallicity are fixed equal to the input ones.\nTo compute the total mass from the X-ray analysis, we follow the \"forward\" method of M10 (see also, Vikhlinin et al. 2006). The\nsurface brightness and the temperature profiles are fitted by the analytic formulae:\n1\n(r/rt )\u2212a\n(r/rc )\u2212\u03b1\n;\nT\n=\nT\n.\n(5)\nn p ne = n2\n0\n[1 + (r/rc )2 ]3\u03b2\u2212\u03b1/2 [1 + (r/rs )\u03b3 ]\u000f/\u03b3\n[1 + (r/rt )b ]c/b\nSince we exclude the cluster central part from our analysis, we do not model the cooling core region as done in Vikhlinin et al.\n(2006). This excision is common in both simulations (e.g. M10, Nagai et al. 2007) and observations (e.g. Vikhlinin et al. 2009; Ettori\net al. 2010) to avoid, in the former case, the influence of the overcooled central region and, in the latter case, the presence of central\nactive galaxy, cool-core regions, gas sloshing. The 2D analytic formulae are deprojected and the total mass is recovered by assuming\nhydrostatic equilibrium, that from Eq. 1 it can be written as\n\u0012\n\u0013\nkT (r)r d ln \u03c1 d ln T\nMX (< r) = \u2212\n+\n,\n(6)\nG\u03bcmp d ln r d ln r\n18\n\nThe Helium abundance used in the plasma emission was modified from 9.77e-02 to 7.72e-2 to be consistent with the hydrogen mass fraction used as input in\nGADGET-3 code.\n\n\fLensing and X-ray mass estimates - Simulations\n\n7\n\nwhere T and \u03c1 are the deprojected 3D analytic profiles. Following this procedure, we obtain the X-ray mass that we compare with\nthe true mass of the simulated cluster. The uncertainties in the estimate of this mass, eMX , were obtained through Monte Carlo\nsimulations. In each Monte Carlo realization, surface brightness and temperature profiles were varied within their measured errors.\nEach time a new mass was then derived. The resulting uncertainty were defined as the standard deviation computed over 100 such\nrealizations.\n6. RESULTS\n\n6.1. Weak-lensing mass estimates\nWeak-lensing allows us to measure the mass of the cluster projected on the plane of the sky. The NFW analytic formula of the\nintegral along the line of sight of the mass contained in a cylinder is M(R2D ) = 4\u03c1s rs3 h(x), where x = R2D /rs and\n\uf8f1\nq\nx\u22121\n\uf8f4\n\u221a2\n\uf8f4\n(x > 1)\narctan\nx2 \u22121\nq x+1\nx \uf8f2\n(7)\nh(x) = ln +\n2\n1\u2212x\n\u221a\n(x < 1) .\narctanh 1+x\n2 \uf8f4\n\uf8f4 1\u2212x2\n\uf8f3\n1\n(x = 1)\nThe profile parameters rs and \u03c1s are obtained from fitting the tangential shear profile, as discussed above.\nUnfortunately, in most cosmological applications the projected mass is not the interesting quantity. Rather, we need to measure\nthe three-dimensional mass . To derive it by de-projecting the two-dimensional mass, one needs to make strong assumptions about\nthe shape of the cluster, which is usually assumed spherical. In this case, the NFW model is given by\n\u0015\n\u0014\ny\nM(r) = 4\u03c0rs2 \u03c1s ln(1 + y) \u2212\n,\n(8)\n1+y\nwhere y = r/rs . To both the 2D and the 3D masses we associate errors, eMW L,2D and eMW L,3D , computed by propagating the errors\non rs and \u03c1s , as obtained from fitting the tangential shear profiles.\nIn the following, we show how well we measure projected and de-projected mass profiles of the clusters in our sample. In\nboth cases, the quality of the mass measurement is assessed by means of the ratio QWL between measured and true mass: QWL =\nMWL /Mtrue . The uncertainty on this ratio, eMW L /Mtrue , accounts only for the errors in the weak-lensing mass since the true mass is\nperfectly known from simulations. The weighted-mean of both the 2D and the 3D weak-lensing bias radial profiles, < QWL >, is\nshown by the solid red line in Fig. 1. Its scatter is quantified by the standard deviation of its distribution, and is represented by the\nshaded yellow region. In formulae:\n\u0014\n\u00150.5\n\u03a3i (QWL,i (R/Rvir,i )\u2212 < QWL >)2 \u00d7 eMWL,i\n\u03a3i QWL,i (R/Rvir,i ) \u00d7 eMWL,i\nand scatter =\n(9)\n< QWL >=\n\u03a3i eMWL,i\n\u03a3i eMWL,i\nThe profiles are plotted in units of Rvir . The over-imposed crosses refer to the weighted averaged QWL computed at the significant\nradius of each object, with average computed at a radius corresponding to a fixed overdensity \u2206, (R\u2206,i /Rvir,i ), and not over the whole\nradial profile (R/Rvir,i ). They are located at the respective averaged over-density radii. The cross horizontal bars show the dispersion\naround the radii in units of Rvir . The quantitive version of Fig. 1 is reported on Table 2 where we resume all our results. Each value\nof Q3D,WL and its corresponding uncertainty is listed in Table B 6 of Appendix B.\nTwo important conclusions emerge from this analysis. First, the mass measured fitting the reduced tangential shear profile with an\nNFW functional is biased low. The bias amounts to \u223c 7 \u2212 10% between R2500 and R500 and reaches \u223c 13% for larger distances from\nthe cluster center. Second, the scatter in both two- and three-dimensional masses ranges between \u223c 10% at small radii and \u223c 25% at\nlarger radii, being 20% at R500 .\nThese results agree with the findings of M10 and Becker & Kravtsov (2011), confirming that the weak-lensing analysis via the\nKSB pipeline does not introduce significant systematics\n6.2. X-ray mass estimates\nContrarily to the optical mass measurements, the X-ray mass derivation gives directly the 3D mass profile. Therefore, we can\nstraightly define the ratio between the X-ray mass and the true ones: QX = MX /Mtrue . Similarly to weak lensing analysis, we compute\nthe weighted average of QX over the whole sample and the standard deviation of the distribution (Eq. 9). In Fig. 2, we plot the values\nonly within R500 , which is the radius reached by most of the surface brightness and temperature profiles (Table 3).The cross shown\nat R200 is the result of the extrapolation of the analytic formulae. On the third part of Table 2, we report the weighted-averaged QX\nand its scatter. Each QX value and its corresponding uncertainty is listed in Table B 7 of Appendix B.\nFig. 2 confirms some previous findings that we will synthesize here postponing to Section 8 a more profound discussion.\nThe average X-ray mass is consistently underestimating the true mass. The X-ray bias is around 25% at the center and 30-35% at\nR500 . The decline in the most external regions is expected since the cluster outskirts present a more dramatic lack of hydrostatic\nequilibrium (Lau et al. 2009) and a stronger influence of gas clumpiness (Nagai & Lau 2011). The presence of gas clumps affects\nthe X-ray mass determination in two ways: it shallows the surface brightness profile and it cools X-ray temperature (see more on\nthis in the Section 8.) Massive systems, as the ones studied in this paper, are expected to be still accreating and therefore far for an\nequilibrium state. Moreover, the temperature bins in the external regions, where the temperature profile declines more steeply, are\nusually larger containing more temperature structure. Finally, the large bias on the most external region has to be taken with caution\nsince it is not the result of a measurement but of an extrapolation. The dispersion around the average is quite small. The standard\ndeviation is less than 10% at all radii apart from R2500 where it is 12%. These numbers are twice or three times smaller than the\ngravitational lensing dispersion.\n\n\f8\n\nRasia et al.\n\nF IG . 1.- Comparison between weak-lensing and true masses using all clusters in the sample (60 lens planes).

These are plotted as a function of the distance from the cluster center\nin units of the virial radius. The crosses in each panel mark the average locations of various over-density radii and their amplitude is the weighted average bias at\neach significant radius.

CLUSTER CLASSIFICATION\n\nWe investigate in this Section the efficiency in reducing bias and scatter on both X-ray and gravitational lensing masses of two\nselecting criteria. We create different sub-samples determined by the morphology of the X-ray images or by the presence of substructures on their environment.\n7.1. Masses and X-ray morphology\nTo limit the impact of the non-thermal processes on the X-ray mass estimates, clusters are often selected on the basis of their\nappearance. The literature is rich of studies where clusters have been classified into relaxed, or regular, and unrelaxed, or disturbed,\nbecause of their X-ray morphology (e.g. Zhang et al. 2008; Vikhlinin et al. 2009). Most of the time, the classification is done\n\"visually\", i.e. simply quantifying the regularity of an object from the X-ray image in the soft band. More objective criteria,\nproposed in the past, are the power ratios, centroid-shift, asymmetry and fluctuation parameters, and hardness ratio. We test all of\nthem and present here our result.\nThird order power ratio and centroid shift. Buote & Tsai (1995) suggested to decompose the surface brightness distribution\nin multipoles. The high order multipoles, usually normalized by the monopole and called power ratios, are used to quantify the\ncontribution of different scale components (asymmetries and substructures) to the surface-brightness power spectrum relative to the\nlarge-scale smooth cluster emission. Most information in the power spectrum is contained in the first four multipoles. P0 is the\nmonopole. The power ratio P1 /P0 measures the dipole of the X-ray emission, which is zero if measured with respect to the X-ray\ncentroid. The power ratio P2 /P0 measures the ellipticity (quadrupole). The third order power ratio P3 /P0 can be used to quantify\nasymmetries and is the best indicator of clusters with multimodal distributions. Substructures on smaller scales contribute to higher\norder multipoles.\nAnother indicator of the dynamical state and of the asymmetry of the X-ray emission is the centroid-shift, i.e. the shift of the\nsurface brightness centroid in apertures of increasing size. This parameter points out the dynamical state of the cluster as well as the\nasymmetry. Following Poole et al. (2006) and Maughan et al. (2008), we define the centroid-shift as\nsP\n2\n1\ni (\u2206i \u2212 h\u2206i)\n,\n(10)\n\u00d7\nw=\nRmax\n(N \u2212 1)\n~ c,i \u2212 R\n~ c,max is the shift of the centroid in the i\u2212th aperture with respect to\nwhere Rmax is the radius of the largest aperture, and \u2206i = R\n~ c,max . h\u2206i is the mean value of the various \u2206i and the sum is done over all the N apertures with\nthe centroid in the largest aperture, R\nradii up to Rmax . In this work we assumed N = 17 apertures with radii ranging between Rmin = 0.15 \u00d7 R500 and Rmax = R500 .\nThe third\u2013order power ratio and the centroid shift were shown to be effective in classifying clusters by two recent works by Cassano\net al. (2010) and B\u00f6hringer et al. (2010). Clusters are located in a rather well defined region in the P3 /P0 \u2212 w plane: objects with\nsmall centroid shift and small P3 /P0 are classified as \"regular\". The majority of them are cool core systems, not very dynamically\nactive and showing absence or very little radio emission. For all these reasons, often, these objects are referred as \"relaxed\".\nIn this work, we compute the power ratio, P3 /P0 , and the centroid-shift, from the signal of the region within R500 of the masked\nimages. With this attention, we aim to evaluate the \"irregularity\" of the actual portion of the image that we use to retrieve the mass.\nBoth the values and their uncertainties are derived from Monte Carlo simulations. We create 100 new images where the photons are\nre-distribuited accordingly to a Poisson statistics. We evaluate the estimators in each image. Finally, we extract the medians and\nthe 16th and 84th percentile of the Monte Carlo distributions to represent the final values of the morphological estimators and their\nuncertainties.\n\nF IG . 2.- Comparison between X-ray and true masses using the whole sample. The meaning of lines, crosses and shaded regions is the same of Fig.1.\n\n\f10\n\nRasia et al.\n\nThe third order power ratios and the centroid shifts of our sample with their uncertainties are shown in the left panel of Fig. 3. We\nrecognize the region with regular systems by slightly relaxing the criteria adopted by Cassano et al. (2010). In our work, we define\na cluster to be regular when w < 0.03 and P3 /P0 < 2 \u00d7 10\u22127 . Our choice is motivated by the fact that our aperture is equal to R500 ,\nthus larger than the 500 kpc aperture radius analyzed by Cassano et al. (2010). Reducing this radius, they naturally measured lower\nvalues of the morphological estimators and, in particular, of the power ratios (B\u00f6hringer et al. 2010).\nThe 17 regular objects are denoted by asterisks in the figure. In most cases, these are systems with small companions or some\nminor irregularity in the surface brightness map. The full classification is listed in Table 3 below the column \"P3 /P0 , w\". Two extreme\nexamples are represented in the right panel of Fig. 3. The X-ray images of the most disturbed system of our sample (CL 13) are\nshown on the top panels, while the bottom panels refer to a relaxed cluster (CL 9).\nThe uncertainties on our parameters are smaller than those of B\u00f6hringer et al. (2010) because of the better spatial resolution of\nChandra with respect to XMM-Newton (see B\u00f6hringer et al. 2010, for a detailed discussion about the influence on spatial resolution\nor point-spread function). The comparison between their work and that by Cassano et al. (2010), based on Chandra data, confirms\nthis statement. The large exposure time assumed in our mock observations ensures a high counts statistics and, therefore, a further\nreduction on the uncertainties. If future missions will reproduce the great spatial resolution of Chandra, both power-ratios and\ncentroid shifts will be available with sufficient accuracy for a large number of objects, thus allowing highy detailed studies of cluster\nmorphologies.\nWe now proceed by checking whether the lensing and true masses biases improve when selecting only the X-ray regular systems.\nSimilarly to Fig. 1, we show in Fig. 4, QWL as a function of the distance from the cluster center for the sub-samples of regular\nsystems. Quantitative results are listed in Table 2 including those for QX .\nThe scatter on lensing bias is reduced by 20%-40%. However, the bias itself worsen with respect to the whole sample. Clearly,\na selection based on the X-ray morphology is not optimal for lensing purposes. The reason of this behavior can be explained by\ncomparing Table 3 and Table B 6. Among the X-ray regular clusters, there are three images (projection 2 of CL1, CL9, and CL20)\nwhose lensing measurements are severely under-estimated. All of them present in the outskirts of the optical images filaments or\nfalling substructures, that do not have any obvious counterpart in the X-ray images or are lying outside the Chandra field of view.\nJeltema et al. (2008) and Piffaretti & Valdarnini (2008) claimed to find a significant trend of the X-ray masses bias on the morphological estimators. We investigate this aspect further by including an analysis of the biases in the weak-lensing mass reconstruction.\nTo this purpose, we considered the absolute values of |(1 \u2212 Q3D,W L )| to evaluate the dependence for any deviation. A linear fit between the mass biases and the morphological estimators has been computed accounting for measurement errors in both variables.\nThe results are reported in Table 4. The centroid shift performs better that the third order power ratio. The slopes of the Q \u2212 w relations are always significantly different from zero with the correct sign (negative for the X-ray bias and positive for the weak-lensing\ndeviations). The best fit values are similar to those found by Jeltema et al. (2008) and Piffaretti & Valdarnini (2008). We further\nquantify the correlation between the mass biases and P3 /P0 or w by means of the Pearson correlation coefficient. We find always a\nnegative correlation, being the values between -0.3 and -0.4 for w and around -0.2 and -0.3 for P3 /P0 .\nIn Fig. 5 we present the best combinations: QX \u2212 w for R2500 , and |1 \u2212 Q3D,W L | \u2212 w for R1000 and R500 . The top panels, are similar to\nFig. 3 where the different colors and symbols refer to different values of the mass bias. The red triangles refer to clusters whose X-ray\nmass biases, QX , are within 20% or whose weak-lensing-masses deviations, |(1 \u2212 Q3D,W L )|, are within 10%. In all three top panels,\nwe distinguish no segregation of colors. This implies that a better estimate of the total mass (red triangles) does not necessarily\ncome from regular clusters defined on the basis of P3 /P0 and w values. However, for the centroid shift, even if this condition is\nnot be necessary, it is sufficient at all radii: the weighted-average bias for clusters whose centroid shift is lower than 0.3 is 15-20%\nlower than those with w > 0.06 (see difference on horizontal lines in the central panels). As confirmation, the third order power ratio\nweakly discriminate between good and bad estimates.\n\nF IG . 3.- On the left: the distribution of clusters in the P3 /P0 \u2212 w plane. The asterisks represent clusters classified as regular.

On top of the two estimators discussed, we tested other X-ray evidences used in literature to\nidentify disturbed morphology. Zhang et al. (2010) and Okabe et al. (2010) (Locuss collaboration) considered the asymmetry and\nfluctuation parameters as introduced by Conselice (2003). Originally these parameters were created to quantitatively measure the\ndistribution of stellar light in galaxies. The Locuss collaboration used them in 12 clusters observed by XMM-Newton. The two\nparameters are defined as A = \u03a3(|I \u2212 R|)/\u03a3I and F = \u03a3(I \u2212 B)/\u03a3I, where I is the [0.7-1.2] keV soft image, R and B are the same\nimage rotated by 180 degrees, the first, and smoothed, the second. The smoothing kernel used by Locuss collaboration was equal to\n2 arcmin or 400 kpc at redshift z = 0.2 We choose three values for the FWHM of the smoothing Gaussian kernel: 320 kpc, 40 kpc,\nand 20 kpc. The first is similar to the one previous used in literature, the other two are smaller to take into account that our synthetic\nimages, mimiking Chandra ACIS-S3 detector, have better spatial resolution.\nSubsequently, we tested two hardness ratio indicators. Gitti et al. (2011) built hardness ratio maps, obtained by dividing an hardband image ([1.5-7.5 keV]) by a soft image ([0.3-1.5] keV), to identify presence of cold gas in Hydra A, a 3-4 keV cluster at redshift\nz \u223c 0.05. Similarly, we define two parameters H1 = \u03a3(H \u2212 S)/\u03a3S and H2 = \u03a3(H/S) where H and S are the hard and soft images\nsmoothed with a gaussian of FWHM=320 kpc and 50 kpc.\nFinally, we consider the distance between the centers, \u2206C used in the our X-ray and weak-lensing analysis. In the former case, we\nconsidered the X-ray centroid, while in the latter we used the center of the BCG, which is also coincident with the minimum of the\nDM-potential well. A shift between the two centers might testimony a recent merger able to separate the two components, as for the\nBullet cluster (Markevitch et al. 2004).\nAll these parameters have been compared with the X-ray and weak lensing bias measures. For the weak lensing case we consider\nboth the values of Q3D,W L and of |Q3D,W L \u2212 1| to evaluate general deviation from the true mass. As done for the centroid-shift and\nthe third order power ratio, we measured the correlation between all the parameters and the biases. We found that none of the new\nparameters is more strongly related to the bias than the centroid shift and the third order power ratio. On the opposite, their Pearson\ncorrelation coefficient is always smaller than 0.1 in absolute values.\n7.2. Masses and cluster environment\nAs shown in M10, the scatter in WL mass measurements is due to substructures and triaxiality. The combination of X-ray and\nlensing data may help to further identify the most spherical systems or to correct the mass estimates for triaxiality effects (Morandi\net al. 2011; Sereno et al. 2010). However, these techniques are still model-dependent and subject to strong assumptions. Furthermore,\nthey require a certain amount of handling of the data which cannot be applied to a large sample of objects. Substructures, instead,\nmay be more easily identified.\nTo classify clusters on the basis of the level of substructures in their surroundings, we visually inspect the projected mass maps of\neach cluster in our sample. We identify the objects whose environment is poor of substructures within a region of 5 h\u22121 Mpc around\ntheir centers. At first, we look directly at the intrinsic density map from the simulations. We find 10 cluster projections that match\nthis criterium. We named this sample \"I. poor\" (Intrinsically poor). Often a regular cluster is not part of the poor environment class\n\n\fLensing and X-ray mass estimates - Simulations\n\n13\n\nF IG . 5.- Distribution of the clusters power ratio P3 /P0 and centroid shift in dependance of the mass biases.

This is easily explained by presence of substructures outside the X-ray field of view which is\nlimited to \u223c 2.5h\u22121 Mpc. One of such clusters is the already-mentioned projection 2 of CL9. Despite being X-ray regular (Fig. 3)\nit shows evidence of filaments in its surroundings causing a strong underestimate of the weak-lensing masses in that projection (see\nTable B 6). This is the main reason for which some X-ray regular objects show a large weak-lensing bias: they are lying in a rich\nenvironment that cannot be detected in the X-ray images.\nThe mass bias of the clusters classified 'I. poor' is reported on Table 2 and showed in the middle panels of Fig. 4 for the weaklensing masses. The exciting result is that the projected true masses are almost exactly recovered. For these systems QW L deviates\nfrom unity by only a few percent for the 2D mass and by less than 5% for the 3D mass. The scatter is strongly reduced especially\namong the two-dimensional masses, being only of order \u223c 5% over a wide range of radii. This is smaller than that found in M10\ncombining SL and WL non-parametrically. For the three-dimensional masses, the scatter at the most external radii (R500 and R200 )\ndecreases by \u223c 50\u221260% with respect to the whole sample and by 20-40% with respect to the systems with regular X-ray morphology.\nAs shown in M10, this residual bias is caused by triaxiality. It may be alleviated by means of introducing a parameter describing the\nelongation along the line of sight in the fitting model. This requires a combination of different probes, as proposed by Morandi et al.\n(2011) and Sereno et al. (2010), who combine lensing and X-ray data. However, a large uncertainty still remains, due to possible\nnon-thermal pressure in the ICM, which is degenerate with the cluster triaxiality.\nAs second step, we visually inspect the projected mass maps reconstructed from the synthetic weak lensing observations. The\nmethod used for the reconstruction is described in Cacciato et al. (2006) and in Merten et al. (2009), although we do not make use\nof the SL systems in this test. This approach, even if more \"observationally-oriented\", is still subjective. Furthermore, the visual\nclassification is more challenging because the resolution smears out possible features and the noise in the optical images reduces the\ndetectability of clumps. Clusters that appear isolated in the reconstructed mass maps are called \"O. poor\". This classification is also\npresented in Table 3. The results on the weak-lensing and X-ray mass biases are reported in Table 2 and shown in the bottom panels\nof Fig. 4. The net improvement in terms of bias and scatter of both the 2D and 3D masses is now much less evident, but still masses\nare better recovered than in the sub-sample of X-ray regular clusters. In particular, the bias is reduced by about a factor two at R500\nand R200 , for both 2D and 3D masses.\nNotice from Table 2 that the X-ray bias and scatter does not vary substantially in the three samples ( regular, I. poor, and O.\npoor). This outcome is expected because, in general, X-ray masses have small scatter. The intra-cluster medium is generally more\nspherical than the DM or the galaxy distribution, especially outside the core (Lau et al. 2011). As a consequence, the X-ray method\nis less prone to triaxiality. This implies that removing/adding a few objects, as long as they are not very disturbed, does not change\nsignificantly the result.\n8. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION\n\nThis paper is an extension of the work of M10. We compared galaxy cluster masses derived from gravitational lensing and X-ray\nusing 20 new massive halos simulated at high resolution including radiative gas physics. Each halo was observed along 3 different\nlines of sight and located at redshift 0.25. We used an optical and an X-ray simulators, namely Skylens and X-MAS, to build\nboth optical and X-ray mock images mimicking, Subaru and Chandra observations, respectively. To perform the weak lensing\nanalysis, we measured the galaxy shapes using the KSB method and we derived the masses by fitting the tangential shear profiles\nusing NFW functionals. For the X-ray, instead, we used the forward approach described in M10 and derived the mass under the\nhypothesis of hydrostatic equilibrium. Then, we selected a subsample of regular clusters on the basis of the X-ray morphological\nestimators (the third moment of power ratios and the centroid shift). We further classified the objects in our sample based on the\npresence of substructures in the cluster environment. This classification was based on the visual inspection of both the true and the\nlensing-reconstructed projected mass maps of the systems under investigation.\nIn the following, we discuss our main results:\nQW L and QX for the whole sample. The weak lensing mass bias is less than 10% within R500 , and it grows to 13% in the most\nexternal region. The X-ray bias is around 25% in the central region and increases to 33% at R500 . The scatter of the bias is always\nhigher by at least a factor of two for weak lensing than for X-ray mass measurements. The weak lensing bias and its large scatter\nis caused by presence of substructures in the cluster surroundings and by the triaxiality of the systems. The X-ray bias, instead, is\nmainly due to the lack of hydrostatic equilibrium, presence of clumps (in the external regions) and temperature dis-homogeneity (see\nfurther discussion).\nQ and morphological parameters. We evaluate the effectiveness of some morphological estimators for reducing the mass bias.\nWe found that a selection based on centroid shift (w < 0.03) and third order power ratio (P3 /P0 < 2 \u00d7 10\u22127 ) reduces the X-ray bias,\nespecially in the central regions. This selection has no effect on the weak lensing bias itself but it decreases the scatter by 20-40%\n(see Table 2). Among the different morphological parameters used to identify disturbed morphologies (including asymmetry and\nfluctuation parameters, two hardness ratios, and the optical-X-ray center offset), the only one that shows a mild correlation with the\nbias is the centroid-shift. This is true also for the weak-lensing masses bias. In terms of future X\u2013ray missions, an optimal use the\ncentroid-shift to identify \"ideal\" clusters to maximizing the efficiency of the mass measurements would require an imaging quality\ncomparable to that of Chandra, but over a larger field of view so that the area probed by X-ray and optical observations become\ncomparable.\n\n\fLensing and X-ray mass estimates - Simulations\n\n15\n\nQW L substructures. We established already that weak lensing methods based on single model fitting can severely fail to measure\nthe mass of clusters in presence of massive substructures (M10). Working on single objects, the effect of substructures could be\nminimized by adopting multi-halo fitting techniques (Okabe et al. 2011), provided that substructures can be clearly identified as peaks\nin the weak lensing maps. Filtering techniques might also offer a possibility to mitigate the effect of structures perturbing the cluster\nshear profiles (e.g. Gruen et al. 2011). We verified that removing from the sample those clusters which live in environments rich of\nsubstructures allows to minimize both the bias and the scatter in the weak lensing mass estimates. Unfortunately, the identification\nand the characterization of the substructures is a very difficult task. We will dedicate to another work the study of substructures\ndetectability. Several galaxy surveys are planned for the next years which will scan large portions of the sky (see e.g. The Dark\nEnergy Survey Collaboration 2005; LSST Science Collaborations et al. 2009; Refregier et al. 2010). The data are expected to\nprovide galaxy number densities in the range 15 \u2212 40 gals arcmin\u22122 , allowing to measure the shear signal of several thousands of\nclusters. Having deep and sharp observations over a large field of view and with good spatial resolution would make it possible to\ndetect substructure in a more efficient way than what presented in this analysis, thus enabling to virtually identify all the relevant\nsubstructures. Detection and mass measurements of sub-structures are already possible in the Coma cluster (Okabe et al. 2010).\nMethods based on higher order lensing distortion measurements (lensing flexion) also seem very promising (e.g. Okura et al. 2007;\nVelander et al. 2011).\nQW L triaxiality. Triaxiality introduces a further scatter and bias in the three-dimensional lensing mass estimates. Even minimizing\nthe impact of substructures, by restricting the analysis to the poor environment clusters, we notice a tendency to underestimate the\ntotal mass on average. This is due to the fact that a large fraction of the systems in the sample is mostly elongated on the plane of\nthe sky. Under this circumstance, we expect to under-estimate the mass in the de-projection phase (see e.g. Feroz & Hobson 2011).\nConversely, the mass is over-estimated in clusters seen along their major axis. Studies based on simulations showed that clusters\nforming in a CDM framework are generally prolate systems (Shaw et al. 2006; Allgood et al. 2006; Lau et al. 2011). For such mass\ndistributions there is a larger chance to infer a smaller mass within a given radius from the projected density field and explains both\nthe presence of the 2D bias and its increase after the de-projection. This result depends on the selection of our sample which is mass\nlimited. If our clusters were chosen for their lensing signals, and in particular for strong-gravitational lensing, we would have had\nmore objects strongly aligned along the line of sight (e.g. Meneghetti et al. 2010). Then, the measured masses would have been\nover-estimated on average.\nQX and QW L and dependence on cluster mass. The mass range in our sample is too narrow to make a robust statistical analysis\non the dependence of QX and QW L on the cluster masse. However, we can attempt to evaluate this effect by averaging these values\non the three most (CL2, CL10, and CL11, all with M500 > 7.5 \u00d7 1014 h\u22121 M ) and least massive systems (CL 4, CL18, and CL19, all\nwith M500 < 3.5 \u00d7 1014 h\u22121 M ). The main result is that the bias Q3D,W L of the smallest clusters drops by almost a factor of 5 going\nfrom R2500 ( < Q3D,W L >= 0.94 \u00b1 0.20) to R200 (< Q3D,W L >= 0.83 \u00b1 0.39), while for massive clusters there is no change in the bias,\nalways equal to 0.95. This indicates that at large distances from the cluster center, the mass estimates of the least massive clusters will\nbe affected by a stronger bias compared to those of the most massive systems. This is not surprising, because M10 already showed\nthat, when the tangential shear is used to measure the mass at a given radius, additional sources of shear, like massive substructures,\nlocated outside that radius lead to under-estimate the mass. The impact of such perturbers is obviously more significant in clusters\nof smaller mass. Repeating the same test for the X-ray bias we do find the opposite trend. The bias of larger systems goes from\n< QX >= 0.77 at R2500 to < QX >= 0.70 at R500 (with error of order of 0.05), while for smaller objects the bias is constantly equal to\n0.74. This can be ascribed to two main reasons: the massive objects are the most disturbed ones and they have a complex temperature\nstructure (Ameglio et al. 2009). Its importance on the X-ray mass determination will be investigated more on the next paragraph.\nQX and temperature distribution. The values of QX that we find in this work are consistent with what previously found in R06.\nIn M10 we find smaller deviations being the average bias around 10%. There are some differences between this paper and M10\nwhich could affect the analysis, such as five times smaller exposure time and a narrower field of view. However, we believe that\nmost of the difference is not due to the X-ray preparation and analysis but to the physics adopted in the simulation. The simulations\nanalysed in M10 included a description of thermal conduction, which is instead set to zero in the simulations presented here and in\nthose analysed by R06.\nBefore elaborating more on the effect of changing the physical description of the ICM, we remind that the X-ray mass is derived\nfrom the hydrostatic equilibrium equation (Eq. 1) where three terms are present: the derivative of the gas density, the derivative of\nthe temperature, and the temperature itself at the radius considered. The over- or under-estimate of the temperature leads to an overor under- estimate on the X-ray mass of identical amplitude. If the temperature structure is spherically homogenous, the measured\ntemperature will be independent on the method used to derived it. However, when the plasma presents temperature structures in\nthe annulus, the X-ray measurements are biased low because the X-ray detectors of Chandra and XMM-Newton have an higher\nefficiency on the soft band and, thus, weight more colder gas (Mazzotta et al. 2004). In presence of inhomogeneity, the X-ray\ntemperature is, therefore, lower than the mass-weighted one. As consequence, the hydrostatic masses computed directly using the\nintrinsic gas density and mass-weighted temperatures of the simulated clusters are higher than those obtained following entirely the\nX-ray procedure. This is illustrated in Fig. 6, where we plot the values of QX reported in Table. 2 in black and a similar ratio related\nto intrinsic calculation in red. For all clusters, the intrinsic bias is 12.6% \u00b1 5.9%, 18.3% \u00b1 4.5%, and 22.6% \u00b1 5.1% at the three radii,\nrespectively. In the case of regular and poor systems, these values decrease to \u223c 10%, \u223c 15% and \u223c 17% and are in agreement with\nprevious works based only on intrinsic evaluation of the hydrostatic equilibrium mass using the mass-weighted temperature (e.g.\nPiffaretti & Valdarnini 2008; Jeltema et al. 2008; Ameglio et al. 2009; Rasia et al. 2004; Lau et al. 2009).\n\n\f16\n\nRasia et al.\n\nTo stress more the dependence of the X-ray mass bias on the temperature difference, we plot on the right panels of the Fig. 6 QX\nversus QT = TX /TMW for the three X-ray-significant over-densities. The uncertainty associated with the temperature bias are equal to\n1 \u03c3 error obtained from the spectroscopic analysis. The over-plotted line is the best fit to the relation: QX = A + B \u00d7 QT calculated\nexcluding very disturbed objects (blue asterisks) and considering the errors in both coordinates. The values of B, for R2500 , R1000 and\nR500 , are largely different from zero (see Table 4) and very close to 1. The biases are strictly correlated one to the other showing\nPearson coefficients equal to \u22120.7, \u22120.8, \u22120.7.\nThese results also suggest an explanation for the difference between our results and those Nagai et al. (2007): their average bias\nis consistent with M10 and lower than the result of this paper. Their analysis and procedure are almost identical to ours, therefore,\nour results can be compared straightforwardly, despite the instrument-setting is slightly different (they consider reproduce synthetic\nobservation of ACIS-I and not ACIS-S3). Indeed in both our works, the choice of the instrument is not as important as in real\nobservation. Our mock images are, by construction, not affected by any calibration issues since we assume the same response files\nwhen generating and analyzing the images. In this condition of perfect calibration, we could have some differences only if the shape\nof the responses will be extremely different in shape (not in normalization), e.g. if an instruments weight a lot more plasma at 5\nkeV in respect to the plasma at 8keV. However, as demonstrated by Mazzotta et al. (2004) in their Fig. 8 the detectors on board of\nChandra and XMM-Newton give consistent answers in this respect. Furthermore, Nevalainen et al. (2010) in a study focused on real\ndata showed that both the Coma Cluster and A1795 have broad band temperatures consistent within the 3% statistical uncertainties\nand broad band fluxes may differ by up to 2-3%. We, therefore, exclude the possibility that the difference between our results and\nNagai et al. (2007) can be due to the instrument chosen.\nAs for the difference with respect to M10, as already mentioned the analysis presented in that paper was based on simulations\nwhich included the effect of thermal conduction, with conduction coefficient set to one-third of the Spitzer value. As discussed by\nDolag et al. (2004), thermal conduction in hot clusters is quite effective not only in removing cold blobs, but also in making the\n\nF IG . 6.- Left panel: QX (black), intrinsic QX assuming mass-weighted temperature (red), and Q3D,W L (green) for all clusters, only regular, and only in poor\nenvironment. The values and scatter of QX and Q3D,W L are reported in Table 2, while those of the intrinsic hydrostatic-mass bias are listed on the text (Section\n8). Right panel: relation between QX and QT = TX /TMW at the three significant radii: R2500 (top panel), R1000 (central panel), and R500 (bottom panels). The lines\nrepresent the best-fit in the form of QX = A + B \u00d7 QT excluding the very disturbed clusters (blue asterisks).\n\n\fLensing and X-ray mass estimates - Simulations\n\n17\n\nthermal structure of the ICM more homogeneous. This leads to an increase of the spectroscopic temperature and, therefore, of the\nhydrostatic mass.\nAs for the comparison, with Nagai et al. (2007), while their simulations do not include thermal conduction, they are based by an\nEulerian Adaptive Mesh Refinement hydrodynamical scheme. As discussed by several authors (e.g. Agertz et al. 2007; Mitchell et al.\n2009; Vazza et al. 2011), Eulerian hydrodynamics leads to a more efficient mixing of gas entropy. Therefore, one expects in Eulerian\nsimulations that low\u2013entropy gas residing in high\u2013density clumps becomes more efficiently mixed, than in SPH simulations, to the\nhigh\u2013entropy ICM. Again, this should result in a more homogenous temperature distribution, with a smaller bias introduced in the\nestimate of X\u2013ray temperature.\nTo summarize our X-ray mass bias derived intrinsically assuming hydrostatic equilibrium and mass-weighted temperature are\ncomparable to previous results. Following the X-ray approach, instead, we confirm the findings of R06 but we find a stronger bias\nin comparison to M10 and Nagai et al. 2007. The further \u223c 10-15% is caused by temperature inhomogeneity (see also Piffaretti &\nValdarnini 2008; Ameglio et al. 2009). This result highlights that, while hydrodynamical simulations are powerful tools to understand\nbiases in observational mass estimates, a detailed assessment of this bias (e.g. its precise value) is still uncertain depending on the\nphysical processes included in the simulations and on their numerical description. In this respect, we remind that none of the recent\ntheoretical studies on X-ray mass biases includes the effect of feedback from AGNs.\nLensing and X-ray masses comparison. We compare the gravitational lensing masses with the X-ray masses following the same\nfitting procedure described in Mahdavi et al. (2008) and M10 to whom we address the curious reader for a detailed description. In\nbrief, for each over-density \u2206, we define a parameter, a\u2206 , as MX = a\u2206 \u00d7 M3D,W L . The error associated correspond to 68% confidence\nlevel. In Table. 5, we report our results for all clusters and for the relaxed sample. We compared the lensing masses (green crosses in\nFig. 6) to both the X-ray-strictly derived masses (black crosses in Fig. 6) and the intrinsic ones (red crosses in Fig. 6). For reference,\nwe include the values found in M10 and in two observational papers: Zhang et al. (2008) for the Locuss sample and Mahdavi et al.\n(2008) for the CCCP sample.\nOur intrinsic results are consistent within the errors with the observational data, especially for regular clusters. Our \"observed\"\nX-ray to weak lensing mass ratios are, instead, consistent only with Mahdavi et al. (2008) for R1000 and R500 . In all the other cases,\nour ratios are lower than the observed ones. This is due, once again, to the temperature in-homogeneity detected in our simulated\nclusters.\nThis last comparison has three consequences. On one hand it could be that SPH codes generate more temperature structures, i.e.\ndeviation from a spherically symmetric temperature distribution, than present in real clusters (Sijacki et al. 2011). Unfortunately,\ncurrent X-ray telescopes cannot provide detailed temperature maps for large sample of clusters with enough spatial resolution to\nconfirm or dismiss this hypothesis. Indeed, previous observational techniques to evaluate temperature structures (Bourdin & Mazzotta\n2008; Zhang et al. 2009) have been applied to a limited number of nearby objects. Increasing the size of the samples for which\ndetailed observational studies are carried out would provide a unique opportunity to test the reliability of simulations in describing\nthe complexity of the ICM thermal structure. Despite this precise match cannot be done at present, some observations have already\nevidenced a significant level of gas clumpiness around the virial radius of some clusters (Simionescu et al. 2011, Vikhlinin et al. in\nprep.), leading to the conjecture that the plasma may be not completely thermalized at R500 . Another possible way to explain the\nmis-match between our results and the observations is that weak-lensing masses of real clusters suffer of some additional bias. For\nexample, as mentioned above, the contamination of shear catalogues by foreground galaxies may bias low the masses. The impact of\nthis source of contamination and its possible correction using color-selection techniques is currently under investigation. Finally, it\nis likely that the inclusion of AGN should significantly reduce the temperature in-homogeneity. In that case, the X-ray temperatures\nwill be closer to the mass-weighted ones, leading to 5%-10% difference between X-ray and weak-lensing masses (see Table5).\nTABLE 5\nth\n\nVALUES FOR DIFFERENT OVERDENSITY AND THEIR UNCERTAINTY FOR OUR SAMPLE ( FIRST 4 ROWS ), M ENEGHETTI ET AL . 2010 (5\nth\nth\nth\nROW ), Z HANG ET AL . 2008 (6 AND 7 ROWS ), AND M AHDAVI ET AL . 2008 (8 ROW ).

COLD - PARTICLES - CUT METHOD\n\nA common characteristics of hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy clusters, is that gas associated to merging galaxies or small\ngroups keep their identity for longer time within the hot ICM atmosphere. This is especially true for simulations including radiative\ncooling, without an efficient feedback mechanism, and for simulations based on SPH, which provide a rather inefficient mixing\nbetween high\u2013 and low\u2013entropy gas phases. These structures are revealed in the X-ray images as compact sources of dense gas,\nwhich are characterized by a strong emission. The majority of them is located in the vicinity of the cluster center. A consequence\nof the overcooling problem is also that the central galaxy shows an extremely powerful X-ray peak. Since the presence of these\nfeatures is mostly due to unaccounted physical processes, the standard procedure is to exclude them after their identification through\na wavelet-detection algorithm (Vikhlinin et al. 1998) and to excise the central 15% of R500 (R06, Rasia et al. 2008; Nagai et al. 2007).\nThis procedure to remove high\u2013density cold gas clumps is rather time-consuming, in particular for bright clusters, as those we\nare analyzing here, since they host a large number of sub-clumps. As a more efficient approach, we explore a method to exclude a\npriori particles which have short cooling time. These particles, which have high density and low temperature, can be identified in a\nwell\u2013determined region of the phase diagram of temperature, Tp , and gas densitie, \u03c1 p . Empirically, we found that all clusters in our\nsample have a separated phase of cooling particles which satisfy the following condition:\nTp < N \u00d7 \u03c10.25\n(A1)\ngas,p .\nThe normalization factor, N, depends on the mass of the cluster being higher for the more massive systems. In our sample it does\nnot vary substantially since the mass range considered is relatively small. Therefore, we consider a fixed value of N equal to 3 \u00d7 106\nwith density expressed in units of (g cm\u22123 ) and temperature in keV. This normalization is conservative, meaning that all the particles\nbelonging to a genuine hot phase of all our cluster lye above the relation set by this limit. The exponential factor, 0.25, depends on\nthe polytropic index. If we assume that the pressure, P \u2261 constant \u00d7 T \u00d7 \u03c1gas , is related to the gas density through the polytropic\nequation: P \u221d \u03c1\u03b3gas , we obtain T \u221d \u03c1\u03b3\u22121\ngas . The polytropic index, \u03b3, physically can vary between \u03b3 = 1 (isothermal plasma) and \u03b3 = 5/3\n(adiabatic gas) (see Sarazin 1988, for a review). For simulated clusters, the polytropic index lies between 1.15 and 1.25 (Ascasibar\net al. 2003; Rasia et al. 2004; Ostriker et al. 2005; Bode et al. 2009), constraining the exponential factor in the equation A1 between\n0.15 and 0.25.\nThis prescription to remove gas particles belonging to a cold phase is visually illustrated in the top panels of Fig. A7. The right\npanel shows all the particles centered on CL1, in a field of view of 16 \u00d7 16 arcmin2 and within 10 Mpc h\u22121 along the line of\nsight (projection 1). The corresponding X-ray synthetic soft energy image is in the central panel. The black line in the right panel\ncorresponds to the cut applied in our sample (see Eq. A1). Only the particles above that line contribute to the X\u2013ray emission shown\nin second soft map (right panel), which is the image used for the analysis presented in this work. The small green circles are the\nregions identified and removed with the wavelet algorithm. The annuli in the two images have radii equal to 0.15\u00d7R500 and R500 . The\ndifference between the two emission maps is evident. Our cutting technique allow us to clean the image from about 30 small blobs\nwhile does not affect the emission of the clusters or of the large sub-clumps. To test this last statement, we analyzed both synthetic\nimages (considering and excluding the overcooled particles) for three clusters in our sample. In the six resulting images, we run the\nwavelet algorithm to identify the X-ray peaks and exclude them. Subsequently, we extract both surface brightness and temperature\nprofiles and confirm that the cutting technique does not introducing any bias. In the bottom panels of Fig.A7 we plot the comparison\nfor CL1, projection 0. Both the surface brightness profiles and the temperature profiles are consistent with each other.\nB . MEASURED MASSES\n\nIn Tables B6 and B7 we report the values of Q3D,W L and QX computed at different radii: R2500 , R1000 , R500 , and R200 . Uncertainties\nare computed following the procedure described in Sections 6.1 and 5.2, respectively.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\nWe acknowledge financial contribution from contracts ASI-INAF I/023/05/0, ASI-INAF I/088/06/0, PRIN-INAF-2009 Grant \"Towards an Italian Network for Computational Cosmology\" and INFN PD51.
