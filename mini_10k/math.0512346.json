\u2217\nGueorgui Tomov Todorov\nJuly 4, 2018\n\nAbstract\nIn this paper we will prove that for a threefold of general type and\nlarge volume the second plurigenera is positive and the fifth canonical\nmap is birational.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction.\n\nOne of the main problems in algebraic geometry is to understand the\nstructure of pluricanonical maps. If X is a smooth complex projective variety of general type and dimension n, then by definition the plurigenera\nPr = h0 (X, OX (rKX )) grow like r n and the pluricanonical maps \u03c6rKX :\nX 99K P(H 0 (X, OX (rKX ))) are birational for sufficiently large r. It is natural to look for minimal values rn and rn\u2032 such that Pr 6= 0 for r \u2265 rn and\n\u03c6rKX is birational for r \u2265 rn\u2032 . On a curve of general type the picture is clear,\nPr 6= 0 for r \u2265 1 and \u03c6rKX is birational for r \u2265 3. For surfaces we have that\nPr 6= 0 for r \u2265 2 and \u03c6rKX is birational for r \u2265 5, by a result of Bombieri\n(cf. [3]).\nOn threefolds the problem is much harder. The question has been extensively studied, for example by Koll\u00e1r [10] and Benviste [2]. Chen and Hacon\nin [5] have a proof that if the irregularity is positive then \u03c67KX is birational.\nM. Chen [6] and S. Lee [14] prove that for X minimal and smooth \u03c66KX is\nbirational. By a recent result of J. Chen, M. Chen and D. Zhang in [4] if X\nis a minimal Gornenstein threefold \u03c6rKX is birational for r \u2265 5. However\nTsuji [17], and later Hacon-Mc Kernan [7], Takayama [16] following ideas of\nTsuji, have shown that for a smooth projective variety of general type and\ndimension n there exists an integer rn , which depends only on n, such that\n\u2217\nThe author would like to thank Professor Christopher Hacon for suggesting the problem and many useful conversations and suggestions.\n\n1\n\n\f\u03c6rKX is birational for r \u2265 rn . This theorem has also a nice consequence,\nnamely if we fix a positive integer M the family of smooth projective varieties of general type, dimension n and volume smaller than M is birationally\nbounded.\nKeeping this in mind it is natural to ask if we can find explicit values\nrn and rn\u2032 such that Pr 6= 0 for r \u2265 rn and \u03c6rKX is birational for r \u2265 rn\u2032 for\na class of varieties of dimension n and volume larger than a fixed positive\nnumber M . We will prove the following theorems:\nTheorem 1.1. Let X be a projective threefold of general type and assume\nthat\nvol(X) > 23043 .\nThen P2 = h0 (X, OX (2KX )) > 0.\nTheorem 1.2. Let X be a projective threefold of general type and assume\nthat\nvol(X) > 43553 .\nThen \u03c65KX is birational.\nHere the volume of X is defined as\nvol(X) = lim sup\nm\u2192\u221e\n\n3!h0 (X, OX (mKX ))\n.\nm3\n\nNote that the above result is optimal since we can construct infinitely\nmany families of threefolds of general type with increasing volume for which\nthe \u03c6rKX is not birational for r \u2264 4. This can be done just by considering\nproducts of curves and surfaces of general type.\nWe will sketch the strategy of the proof for the non-vanishing of the\nsecond plurigenera. The proof of the second statement is similar. We would\nlike to produce a divisor D \u223c \u03bbKX such that D has an isolated log canonical\ncentre at a general point x \u2208 X. If \u03bb < 1, then we get a surjective homomorphism H 0 (X, OX (2KX )) \u2212\u2192 H 0 (X, Cx ) \u223c\n= C and so P2 \u2265 1. Since\nthe volume of KX is large, by an easy dimension count, one finds a small\nrational number \u03bb > 0 and a divisor D \u223c \u03bbKX which has a non-trivial log\ncanonical centre at a general point x \u2208 X. However it could happen that\nthe dimension of the log canonical center is positive. This is not a problem if\nthe dimension of the log canonical centre at x is one since then we can apply\na standard technique to cut down the dimension of the log canonical centre\nand have an isolated log canonical centre for D \u2032 \u223c \u03bb\u2032 KX for some small positive rational number \u03bb\u2032 . If the dimension at x of the log canonical centre is\n2\n\n\ftwo we could still try to cut down the dimension and indeed at the end we\nwould produce a divisor D \u223c \u03bbKX with an isolated log canonical centre but\n\u03bb will not be small enough to give us a bicanonical section. So in this case a\ndifferent approach is needed. In fact using ideas of Mc Kernan [15] and Tsuji\nwe will produce a morphism to a curve and we will use this morphism to\nproduce a section.\n\n2\n2.1\n\nPreliminaries.\nNotation.\n\nWe will work over the field of complex numbers C. A Q-Cartier divisor\nD is nef if D * C \u2265 0 for any curve C on X. We call two Q-divisors D1 , D2\nQ-linearly equivalent D1 \u223c D2 if there exists an integer m > 0 such that\nmDi are Cartier and linearly equivalent. We call two Q-Cartier divisors\nD1 , D2 numerically equivalent D1 \u2261 D2 if (D1 \u2212 D2 ) * C = 0 for any curve\nC on X. A log pair (X, \u2206) is a normal variety X and an effective QWeil divisor \u2206 such that KX + \u2206 is Q-Cartier. A projective morphism\n\u03bc : Y \u2212\u2192 X is a log resolution of the pair (X, \u2206) if Y is smooth and\n\u03bc\u22121 (\u2206) \u222a {exceptional set of \u03bc} is a divisor with simple normal crossing\nsupport. For such \u03bc we write \u03bc\u2217 (KX + \u2206) = KY + \u0393, and \u0393 = \u03a3ai \u0393i where\n\u0393i are distinct integral divisors. A pair is called klt (resp. lc) if there is a log\nresolution \u03bc : Y \u2212\u2192 X such that in the above notation we have ai < 1 (resp.\nai \u2264 1). The number 1\u2212ai is called log discrepancy of \u0393i with respect to the\npair (X, \u2206). We say that a subvariety V \u2282 X is a log canonical centre if it is\nthe image of a divisor of log discrepancy at most zero. A log canonical place\nis a valuation corresponding to a divisor of log discrepancy at most zero. A\nlog canonical centre is pure if KX + \u2206 is log canonical at the generic point\nof V . If moreover there is a unique log canonical place lying over the generic\npoint of V, then we say that V is exceptional. LCS(X, \u2206, x) is the union of\nall log canonical centres of (X, \u2206) through the point x. We will denote by\nLLC(X, \u2206, x) the set of all log canonical centres containing a point x \u2208 X.\n\n2.2\n\nVolumes.\n\nDefinition 2.1. Let X be irreducible projective variety of dimension n and\nlet D be a Q-Cartier divisor. The volume of D is\nvol(D) = lim sup\nm\u2192\u221e\n\nn!h0 (X, OX (mD))\n.\nmn\n\n3\n\n\fWhen D is nef we have that vol(D) = D n , so that for a very ample\ndivisor D the volume of D is just the degree of the image of X given by\nthe linear system |D| (cf. [13], Section 2.2C). The volume depends only on\nthe numerical class of D and it can be extended to a continuous function\nvol: NR1 \u2212\u2192 R, where NR1 = N 1 (X)\u2297R and N 1 (X) is the Neron-Severi group\nof X(cf. [13], Theorem 2.2.43). The volume is invariant under birational\ntransformations(cf. [13], Proposition 2.2.42).\nThe following lemma is a standard tool to produce log canonical centres\nat a general point of a variety.\nLemma 2.1. (cf. [13], Lemma 10.4.11) Let X be an irreducible projective\nvariety of dimension d, L a Q-Cartier divisor and x \u2208 X a smooth point. If\nfor some positive rational number \u03b1 we have that\nvol(L) > \u03b1d ,\nthen for any sufficiently divisible integer k \u226b 0 there exists a divisor\nA = Ax \u2208 |kL|\n\nwith\n\nmultx (A) > k\u03b1.\n\nMoreover we can take k to be independent of the smooth point.\nWe will also use the following variant of Lemma 2.1.\nLemma 2.2. Let X be an irreducible projective variety of dimension d, L a\nQ-Cartier divisor and x, y \u2208 X smooth points. If for some positive rational\nnumber \u03b2 we have that\nvol(L) > 2\u03b2 d ,\nthen for any sufficiently divisible integer k \u226b 0, there exists a divisor\nA = Ax,y \u2208 |kL|\n\nwith\n\nmultx (A) > k\u03b2 and multy (A) > k\u03b2.\n\nProof. The prove of this fact is well known. For a similar argument see for\nexample [13], Proposition 1.1.31.\n\n2.3\n\nMultiplier Ideals.\n\nDefinition 2.2. Let (X, D) be a log pair with X smooth and let \u03bc : Y \u2212\u2192 X\nbe a log resolution. Then define the multiplier ideal sheaf of D to be\nJ (X, D) = \u03bc\u2217 OY (KY /X \u2212 x\u03bc\u2217 Dy) \u2282 OX .\nWhen no confusion is possible we will write simply J (D).\n4\n\n\fWe will recall some facts, which will be needed in what follows. We will\nrepeatedly make use of the following generalization of the Kodaira vanishing\ntheorem, which will be referred to as Nadel vanishing. For a proof of this\ntheorem we refer to section 9.4.B of [13].\nTheorem 2.3. Let X be a smooth projective variety, D a Q-divisor and L\nbe an integral divisor such that L \u2212 D is nef and big. Then\nH i (X, OX (KX + L) \u2297 J (D)) = 0\n\nfor\n\ni > 0.\n\nDefine the log canonical threshold of D at x to be\nc(D, x) = inf{c > 0|J (c * D) is non-trivial at x}.\nWe will also define\nNklt(X, D) = Supp(OX /J (X, D)) \u2282 X\nwith the reduced structure and we will call it the non-klt locus for (X, D)\nAlso we will say that (X, D) is klt (resp. lc) at x \u2208 X if (U, D|U ) is klt\n(resp. lc) for some Zariski open neighborhood U of x. It is often useful to\nassume that LCS(X, D, x) is irreducible at x. The next lemma asserts that\none can achieve this after an arbitrarily small perturbation of D.\nLemma 2.4. (cf. [7] Lemma 2.5, [9], [1] ) Let X be a smooth projective\nvariety and \u2206 an effective Q-divisor and assume that (X, \u2206) is lc at some\npoint x \u2208 X. If W1 , W2 \u2208LLC(X, \u2206, x) and W is an irreducible component\nof W1 \u2229 W2 containing x, then W \u2208LLC(X, \u2206, x). Therefore, if (X, \u2206) is\nnot klt at x, then LLC(X, \u2206, x) has a unique minimal irreducible element,\nsay V . Moreover, there exists an effective Q divisor E such that\nLLC(X, (1 \u2212 \u01eb)\u2206 + \u01ebE, x) = {V }\nfor all 0 < \u01eb \u226a 1. We may also assume that there is a unique place laying\nabove V and if x \u2208 X is general and L is a big divisor, then one can take\nE = aL for some positive number a.\nThe next theorem shows how multiplier ideal sheaves behave with respect\nto restrictions to smooth divisors.\nTheorem 2.5. (cf. [13], Theorem 9.5.1) Let X be a smooth projective variety, let D be an effective Q-divisor on X and let H \u2282 X be a smooth\nirreducible hypersurface which is not contained in the support of D. Then\nthere is an inclusion\nJ (H, DH ) \u2282 J (X, D)H .\n5\n\n\fHere DH is the restriction of D to H, which is by assumption an effective\nQ-divisor on H so that the multiplier ideal sheaf in question is defined.\nJ (X, D)H indicates the image of J (X, D) under the natural maps\nJ (X, D) \u0592\u2192 OX \u2212\u2192 OH .\nFinally we will use the following Lemma from Hacon-Mc Kernan ( [7],\nLemma 2.6).\nLemma 2.6. Let X be a smooth projective variety and D a big divisor on\nX. Let x be a general point, \u03bb a rational number with 0 < \u03bb < 1 and\n\u2206 \u223c \u03bbD a Q-divisor such that x is a component of LCS(X, \u2206, x). Then\nh0 (X, OX (KX + D)) > 0.\n\n3\n\nProof of the Theorem 1.1.\nLet us start by replacing X by a desingularization and assume that\nvol(X) > \u03b13 .\n\nThe value of \u03b1 as in Theorem 1.1 will be determined in the course of the\nproof. We are going to proceed in the following way. The first step will\nbe to produce a log canonical centre at some point x \u2208 X and then to cut\ndown the dimension of the log canonical centre until it is an isolated point.\nThis can be done as long as the log canonical centre is not a surface of small\nvolume. In this last case we are able to produce a morphism to a curve with\nspecial properties which will help us to produce sections of multiples of the\ncanonical bundle.\nOur main tool to cut down the dimension of the log canonical centres is\nthe following result of Hacon-Mc Kernan [7]. Fix a log pair (X, \u2206) where X\nis Q-factorial and \u2206 is an effective Q-divisor. Let V be an exceptional log\ncanonical centre of KX + \u2206. Let f : W \u2212\u2192 V be a resolution of V and let\n\u0398 be a Q-divisor on W . Suppose that there are positive rational numbers \u03bb\nand \u03bc such that \u2206 \u223c \u03bbKX and \u0398 \u223c \u03bcKW . Let \u03bd = (\u03bb + 1)(\u03bc + 1) \u2212 1. We\nsuppose that V is not contained in the augmented base locus of KX and W\nis of general type. Here the augmented base locus is defined as follows. For\na divisor L by the stable base locus B(L) we mean the algebraic set that is\n\u2229Bs(|mL|), where the intersection is taken over all positive integers m. For\na big divisor L the sets B(L \u2212 \u01ebA) are the same for any ample divisor A\nand any 0 < \u01eb \u226a 1 (cf. [13], Lemma 10.3.1) and this is the augmented base\nlocus of L. In this setting we have the following result.\n6\n\n\fTheorem 3.1. (Hacon-Mc Kernan) There is a very general subset U of V\nwith the following property. Suppose that W \u2032 \u2282 W is a pure log canonical\ncentre of KW + \u0398, whose image V \u2032 \u2282 V intersects U. Then for every positive rational number \u03b4 we may find a divisor \u2206\u2032 on X such that V \u2032 is an\nexceptional log canonical centre of KX + \u2206\u2032 where \u2206\u2032 \u223c (\u03bd + \u03b4)KX .\nProof of Theorem 1.1. Denote by X0 the complement of all subvarieties\ncontained in X that are not of general type (since X is of general type, this\nis a countable union of closed subsets) and of the augmented base locus of\nKX . Choose a general point x \u2208 X0 .\nSince vol(KX ) > \u03b13 by Lemma 2.1 for any integer k \u226b 0 there exists a\ndivisor\nA = Ax \u2208 |kKX |\nwith multx (A) > k\u03b1.\nSo, if we consider the divisor\n\u2206 \u2032 = \u03bb\u2032\nfor \u03bb\u2032 <\n\n3\n\u03b1\n\nbut close enough to\n\n3\n\u03b1,\n\nA\nk\n\nwe have that\n\nmultx \u2206\u2032 > 3.\nBut then (X, \u2206\u2032 ) is not klt at x and so by Lemma 2.4, if V is the unique\nminimal irreducible element of LCC(X, \u2206\u2032 , x), we have that\nLLC(X, (1 \u2212 \u01eb)\u2206\u2032 + \u01ebE, x) = {V }\nfor all 0 < \u01eb \u226a 0. Here we can take E \u223c aKX for some positive integer a.\n\u22121\n\u2032\nNow by taking \u01eb < 3\u03b1a\u2212\u03bb\u2212\u03bb\nwe obtain a divisor D such that D \u223c \u03bbKX with\n\u2032\n3\n\u03bb < \u03b1 and\nLCC(X, D, x) = {V }.\nWe will analyze different cases based on the dimension of this log canonical\ncentre.\nCase I - dimV =0.\nTo produce a section of H 0 (X, OX (2KX )) we want to apply Lemma 2.6.\nSo what we need is that \u03bb < 1. This can be achieved for \u03b1 = 3.\nIt is now clear that P2 (X) > 0.\nCase II - dimV = 1.\nWe want to cut down the dimension of the log canonical centre to reduce\nto the previous case. We wish to apply Theorem 3.1, so we need to produce\na divisor of high multiplicity at a very general smooth point of V . Let\n7\n\n\ff : W \u2212\u2192 V be the normalization of V . By our choice of x we know that\nW is of general type, so vol(KW ) \u2265 2 > 15\n8 .\nLemma 2.1 implies that for a smooth point w \u2208 W there exists a Q\u2032\ndivisor \u0398\u2032 \u223c KW with multiplicity greater than 15\n8 at w. Then \u0398 = \u03bc\u0398 \u223c\n8\n\u03bcKW has multiplicity one at w for some \u03bc < 15 . By Theorem 3.1 there is a\ndivisor D \u2032 on X such that\nD \u2032 \u223c (\u03bb + \u03bc + \u03bb\u03bc + \u03b4)KX ,\nwhere \u03b4 is any small positive rational number, and the pair (X, D \u2032 ) has some\nvery general point of V as an exceptional log canonical centre of singularities.\nChoose \u03b4 = 10\u22126 . As before we just have to make sure that \u03bb+\u03bc+\u03bb\u03bc+\u03b4 < 1.\n23\n8\n8\n+ 15\n\u03bb + \u03b4) so it is enough that 15\n+ 23\nNow \u03bb + \u03bc + \u03bb\u03bc + \u03b4 < ( 15\n15 \u03bb + \u03b4 < 1,\n3\nand since \u03bb < \u03b1 this is possible as long as \u03b1 \u2265 10.\nCase III - dimV = 2.\nLet f : W \u2212\u2192 V be a resolution of singularities of V . As in the previous\ncase W is of general type. We will divide our argument in two cases based\non whether the volume of KW is large or small. In the first case when the\nvolume of KW is large we may proceed as before, that is produce a log\ncanonical centre of tKX for some t < 1 and of smaller dimension. In the\nsmall volume case we will show that there exists a fibration onto a curve\nand using this fibration we will be able to prove the existence of the required\nsections.\nSuppose now that vol(KW ) > 64. By Theorem 3.1 and using that\nvol(KW ) > 64 we can guarantee there is a divisor D \u2032 \u223c ( 14 + 54 \u03bb + \u03b4)KX\nsuch that V \u2032 is an exceptional log canonical centre of (X, D \u2032 ) of dimension\nnot greater than one. If dimV \u2032 = 0 then we are done by the discussion in\nCase I. If instead dimV \u2032 = 1 replacing V by V \u2032 and using the discussion in\nCase II we see that there is a divisor D \u2032\u2032 such that\n\u0013\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0012\n55 92\n23 1 4\n38\n8\n\u2032\u2032\n+\n+ \u03bb + \u03b4 + \u03b4 KX \u223c\n+ \u03bb + \u03b4 KX\nD \u223c\n15 15 4 5\n60 75\n15\nfor which for LLC(X, D \u2032\u2032 , x\u2032 ) = {x\u2032 } for a point x\u2032 \u2208 X. As we have seen\n92\nalready, once we have an isolated centre we are done as long as 55\n60 + 75 \u03bb +\n38\n15 \u03b4 < 1, and this can be achieved if \u03b1 > 45.\nTo proceed we need a simplified version of a Lemma 3.2 from Mc Kernan\n[15]. For the convenience of the reader we include a proof of the result.\nRecall that a subset P of X is called countably dense if it is not contained\nin the union of countably many closed subsets of X.\n\n8\n\n\fLemma 3.2. Let Y be a smooth projective variety and suppose that for\nevery point y \u2208 P , where P is a countably dense subset of Y , we may find a\npair (\u2206y , Wy ) such that Wy is a pure log canonical centre for KY + \u2206y at y\nand \u2206y \u223c \u2206/wy for some big Cartier divisor \u2206 on Y . Then there exists a\ndiagram\n\u03c0 /\nY\nY\u2032\nf\n\n\u000f\n\nB\nsuch that f is a dominant morphism of normal projective varieties with\nconnected fibres and for a general fibre Yb\u2032 of f there exists y \u2208 f (Yb\u2032 ) so that\nf (Yb\u2032 ) is a pure log canonical centre for KY + \u2206y with \u2206y \u223c \u2206/w at y, for\nsome w. Also \u03c0 is a generically finite and dominant morphism of normal\nvarieties.\nProof. As \u2206 is big by Lemma 2.4, possibly passing to a subset of P , we may\nassume that Wy is an exceptional log canonical centre. If we decompose\na countably dense set as a countable union at least one of the sets in the\nunion is countably dense. The field of rational numbers is countable so on\na countably dense subset wy does not depend on y. We obtain a countably\ndense subset Q of P such that wy = w, for some fixed rational number w,\nfor every y \u2208 Q. Then there is an integer m\u2032 such that m\u2032 \u2206y and m\u2032 \u2206/w are\nintegral and linearly equivalent, so m\u2032 \u2206y \u2208 |m\u2032 \u2206/w|. In the linear system\n|m\u2032 \u2206/w| take the closure B of the points that correspond to divisors \u2206y .\nReplace B by an irreducible component which contains a set corresponding\nto every point of a countably dense subset of Y and let f : H \u2212\u2192 B be the\nuniversal family over B, H \u2282 B \u00d7 Y . Pick a log resolution of the generic\nfiber and extend this to an embedded resolution of Y \u00d7 U for some open\nsubset U of B. By our assumptions there is a unique exceptional divisor of\nlog discrepancy zero over the generic point of the base corresponding to the\nlog canonical centres Wy . Thus by taking a finite cover of B and passing to\nan open subset of U we may assume that there is a morphism f : Y \u2032 \u2212\u2192 B\nwhose fibre over b \u2208 U is a log canonical centre for KY + \u2206b .\nBy passing to an open subset of U we may assume that f is flat, so\nU maps to the Hilbert scheme. Replace B by the normalization of the\nclosure of the image of U in the corresponding Hilbert scheme and Y \u2032 by\nthe normalization of the pull back of the universal family. Cutting B by\nhyperplanes we may assume that the map from Y \u2032 to Y is generically finite.\n\n9\n\n\fGoing back to the proof of Theorem 1.1 we have left to discuss the case\nin which for every very general x \u2208 X we have a pair of (Dx , Vx ), such that\n(1) Dx \u223c \u03bbKX .\n(2) Vx is a pure log canonical center of Dx .\n(3) dim Vx = 2.\nObserve that here we can take the same \u03bb for every point in a countably\ndense subset of X by the argument of the first part of the proof of the\nLemma above. Now by the previous lemma we have a diagram:\nX\u2032\n\n\u03c0\n\n/X\n\nf\n\n\u000f\n\nB\nwhere \u03c0 is dominant and generically finite of normal varieties, and the image\nof the general fiber of f is Vx for some x \u2208 X.\nWe claim that we can also assume that the map \u03c0 is birational. There\nis a general proof of this fact in Mc Kernan's paper [15]. In our case, because of the low dimension, we present a simpler argument. We will use an\nelementary lemma of calculation of centres of log canonical singularities.\nLemma 3.3. Let Y be a smooth projective variety and let (\u2206i , Wi ) for i =\n1, 2 be a pair such that at some point y \u2208 Y we have that Wi is an exceptional\ncentre of log canonical singularities of codimension 1 at y for KY + \u2206i with\n\u2206i smooth at y. Then there exists Z \u2282 W1 \u2229 W2 a minimal pure centre of\nlog canonical singularities at y for a pair (Y, \u2206) with \u2206 = k(\u22061 + \u22062 ) for\nsome rational number 0 < k \u2264 1.\nProof. First of all notice that if we set c := c(Y, \u22061 + \u22062 , y) we have that\nc \u2264 1. Also LCS(X, c(\u22061 + \u22062 ), y) \u2282 W1 \u2229 W2 . The lemma now follows\nfrom the first part of Lemma 2.4.\nLet Xb be the fibre of f over b \u2208 B. We claim that there exists a\nclosed subset X1 of X such that for any pair (Dx , Vx ) as above, x \u2208\n/ X1 and\n\u03c0(Xb ) = Vx for some b \u2208 B we have that Dx is smooth at x. In fact there is\nan open subset U of B that is parametrizing a universal family Y of divisors\nDb so that for x \u2208 \u03c0(f \u22121 (U )) and f (Xb\u2032 ) = Vx we have Dx = Db . But\nafter shrinking U the singular locus of Y , which is at most two dimensional,\n\n10\n\n\fdominates the union of singularities of divisors Dx with x \u2208 \u03c0(f \u22121 (U )).\nSince B\\U is a finite set the claim follows.\nSuppose now that the inverse image of a general x \u2208 X r X1 under \u03c0\nis contained in two different fibres of f . Then through some general point\nx \u2208 X there are two log canonical centres, say V1 and V2 , of the pairs\n(X, D1 ) and (X, D2 ), with Di \u223c \u03bbKX for i = 1, 2. But since x \u2208\n/ X1 it\nfollows that Di are smooth at x for i = 1, 2 and we can apply the previous\nlemma. So there is C a minimal pure log canonical centre of (X, D) with\nD = k(D1 + D2 ) and 0 < k \u2264 1 contained in the intersection of V1 and V2\nthrough x. We have D \u223c k(2\u03bb)KX . Since dimC \u2264 1 by the analysis in\n8\nCase I and II if 15\n+ 23\n15 (2\u03bb) < 1 we obtain a section of 2KX . The inequality\ncan be arranged for \u03b1 > 20.\nSo we will replace our X with an appropriate smooth birational model\nsuch that we have a morphism to a curve f : X \u2212\u2192 B and for a general\nfiber Xb\u2032 over a point b\u2032 \u2208 B there is a divisor Db\u2032 \u223c \u03bbKX for which we have\nJ (Db\u2032 ) \u2282 OX (\u2212Xb\u2032 ).\nNow run the relative minimal model program for the morphism f : X \u2212\u2192\nB. Denote the resulting morphism by f0 : X0 \u2212\u2192 B and here X0 is Qfactorial with terminal singularities. Since the singularities of X0 are isolated\npoints (cf. [12]), we can replace X0 by a resolution which does not change\nthe general fibre of f0 . Thus by replacing f by the appropriate resolution\nwe can assume that the general fibre of f is a minimal and smooth surface.\nWe need the following lemma.\nLemma 3.4. Let g : Y \u2212\u2192 Z be a surjective morphism from a smooth\nprojective variety Y to a normal variety Z. Let L be a divisor on Y such that\nL \u2261 g \u2217 M + \u2206, where M is nef and big Q-Cartier divisor on Z and \u2206 is an\neffective Q-Cartier divisor on Y . Then H i (Z, Rj g\u2217 (OY (KY +L)\u2297J (\u2206)) = 0\nfor i > 0, j \u2265 0.\nProof. Let g\u2032 : Y \u2032 \u2212\u2192 Y be a log resolution of the pair (Y, \u2206) and let\nh = g\u25e6g\u2032 . By Corollary 10.15 of [11] we have that H i (Z, Rj h\u2217 (KY \u2032 \u2212xg\u2032\u2217 \u2206y+\ng\u2032\u2217 L)) = 0 for i > 0, j \u2265 0. Notice that we have Rj g\u2217\u2032 OY \u2032 (KY \u2032 /Y \u2212xg\u2032\u2217 \u2206y) =\n0 for j > 0 (cf. [13], Theorem 9.4.1) and so the Lemma follows by the\nprojection formula.\nFor an integer m sufficiently large and divisible consider a general divisor\nG \u2208 |m(KX + Xb )| for some general b \u2208 B. For a general b\u2032 \u2208 B set D = Db\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\nand let F = 3D + 1\u22123\u03bb\nm G + (3\u03bb \u2212 2)Xb . We have that J (F ) \u2282 OX (\u2212Xb ).\n11\n\n\fThe divisor F is effective since Xb\u2032 is a pure log canonical centre for (X, D).\nConsider\nE := f\u2217 (OX (2KX ) \u2297 J (F )).\n\nThis is a vector bundle, since it is a torsion free sheaf on a curve.\n\nClaim 1. Let r be the rank of the bundle E. If \u03b1 > 2304 then we have that\nr > 0.\nProof of the Claim. The general fiber Xb is a smooth surface and it is\nenough to prove that\nH 0 (Xb , OXb (2KXb ) \u2297 J (F )|Xb ) 6= 0.\nThe hypothesis of the restriction Theorem 2.5 for multiplier ideal sheaves are\n1\u22123\u03bb\nsatisfied, so we have that J (Xb , (3D + 1\u22123\u03bb\nm G)|Xb ) \u2282 J (X, 3D + m G)|Xb .\nAlso since KX is big we can apply Kawamata's Theorem A from [8], so we\nobtain a surjection H 0 (X, OX (m(KX + Xb ))) \u0589 H 0 (Xb , OX (mKXb )). But\nXb is minimal, so |mKXb | is base point free. This implies that J (Xb , (3D +\n1\u22123\u03bb\nm G)|Xb ) = J (Xb , 3D|Xb ). Define \u2206 = D|Xb and observe that since\n(KX )|Xb \u223c KXb we have that \u2206 \u223c \u03bbKXb . So it is enough to show that\nH 0 (Xb , OXb (2KXb ) \u2297 J (3\u2206)) 6= 0.\nBy a result of Bombieri (cf. [3]) we have that the linear system |4KXb |\nis base point free. If we arrange that 3\u2206 * C < 1, for a curve C that is a\ncomponent of a divisor in |4KXb | and not a component of \u2206, we will have\nthat multx 3\u2206 < 1 for x \u2208 \u2206, and this implies that J (3\u2206) is trivial (cf. [13],\n1\nand thus\nProposition 9.5.11). The inequality could be arranged for \u03bb < 768\nfor \u03b1 > 2304. But the second plurigenera on a surface of general type is\nalways non-zero, and the claim follows.\nBy Lemma 3.4 since KX \u2261 Xb + F we have the vanishing\nH 1 (B, f\u2217 (OX (2KX ) \u2297 J (F )) = 0.\nTensoring the exact sequence\n0 \u2212\u2192 OB \u2212\u2192 OB (b\u2032 ) \u2212\u2192 Ob\u2032 \u2212\u2192 0\nby E we get a section of f\u2217 (OX (2KX ) \u2297 J (F )) \u2297 OB (b\u2032 ). But we have the\ninclusion\nf\u2217 (OX (2KX ) \u2297 J (F )) \u2297 OB (b\u2032 ) \u0592\u2192 f\u2217 (OX (2KX ))\nand we obtain a section of OX (2KX ).\n12\n\n\f4\n\nProof of Theorem 1.2.\n\nWe want to prove that the map given by the linear system |5KX | is birational. So we would like to produce a divisor D \u223c tKX with x, y \u2208LLC(X, D),\nwhere t is a positive rational number. Then apply Kawamata-Viehweg vanishing to lift sections from Cx \u2295 Cy . Unfortunately if we proceed as above\nwe are not able to do so for t < 4. We will have to use a slightly different\napproach.\nAs before we will divide the proof in two parts. First we will study\nthe case when all the surfaces that appear as log canonical centres of some\ndivisor linearly equivalent to a multiple of the canonical class are of large\nvolume. In this case we deduce the result from Takayama's results [16] by\ncarefully choose the necessary constants.\nProof of Theorem 1.2. Start by replacing X by a disingularization. Recall that we are assuming\nvol(KX ) > \u03b2 3 .\nBy Theorem 3.1 and Proposition 5.3 (see also Notation 5.2) of Takayama\n[16] for \u01eb > 0 there is a birational morphism \u03bc : X \u2032 \u2212\u2192 X and a decomposition\n\u03bc\u2217 KX \u223c A + M,\nwhere A is an ample Q-divisor and M is an effective divisor whose support\ncontains all the exceptional locus of \u03bc, such that for two general points x1\nand x2 there is a divisor D,\nD \u223c \u03bbA\nwith\n\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u2032 + 4 2 + 2\u01eb\n2\n+\n\u03bb\n4 2\n1\n(1\u2212\u01eb)\u03b11\n+2\n+ 2\u01eb,\n\u03bb < \u03bb\u20321 +\n(1 \u2212 \u01eb)\u03b11\n(1 \u2212 \u01eb)\u03b12\n\nsuch that xi \u2208Nklt(X \u2032 , D) for i = 1, 2 and codim Nklt(X \u2032 , D) = 3 around at\nleast one of the xi , i = 1, 2. Then by Nadel vanishing we see that (p\u03bbq+1)KX\ngives a birational map. Here \u03b11 is the square root of a lower bound for the\nvolume of the surfaces of general type contained in X, \u03b12 is a lower bound\nfor the volume of the curves of general type contained in X, and\n\u03bb\u20321 < 21/3\n\n3\n.\n(1 \u2212 \u01eb)\u03b2\n\nIn any case we would like to ensure that \u03bb < 4. First note that for any\ncurve C of general type we have vol(C) \u2265 2. So in the inequality above we\nmay take \u03b12 = 2. We also may choose \u01eb = 0.01. Since we will argue as\n13\n\n\fbefore we will take \u03b11 = 6. To achieve that \u03bb < 4 it suffices to be able to\n1\nchoose \u03bb\u20321 < 20\n, and this can be done as long as \u03b2 > 76.\nFinally arguing as in the proof of Theorem 1.1 and the proof of Lemma\n3.2 we can assume that through every point x \u2208 X in a countably dense\nsubset of X we have a surface Vx that is a centre of log canonical singularities\nfor (X, Dx ), Dx \u223c \u03bb\u20321 KX and so we get a diagram\nX \u2032\u2032\n\n\u03c0\n\n/X\n\nf\n\n\u000f\n\nB\nAs before we argue that we can assume that \u03c0 is birational. In fact let x\nand y be two general points of X as above. We would like to produce a\ndivisor D that is lc, but not klt at one of the points with centre a curve and\nthat is not klt at the other point and apply the inductive steps of Takayama.\nConsider the divisor Dx + Dy . By rescaling we can assume that we have a\ndivisor that is lc, but not klt at one of the points, say x, and it is not klt at y.\nThat is, we have D1 \u223c \u03bb\u2032 KX with \u03bb\u2032 \u2264 2\u03bb\u20321 . Also we may assume that the\ncentre of log canonical singularities at x is a surface. If \u03c0 is not birational\nthen there is another divisor Dx\u2032 with centre at x another surface. Consider\nD \u2032 = D1 +kDx\u2032 , where k = max{c, such that (X, D1 +cDx\u2032 ) is lc at x}. Since\nx and y are general points we observe that 0 < k \u2264 1. By possibly applying\nLemma 3.3, we obtain a divisor D \u223c \u03bb\u2032\u2032 KX with the desired properties and\n\u03bb\u2032\u2032 \u2264 3\u03bb\u20321 . Then Proposition 5.3 of [16] implies that by taking\n\u03bb < 3\u03bb\u20321 +\n\n2 + 3\u03bb\u20321 + \u01eb\n+\u01eb\n1\u2212\u01eb\n\nwe have that (p\u03bbq + 1)KX gives a birational map. We can take \u03bb < 4 for\n\u03b2 \u2265 16.\nThus we may assume that we have a morphism to a curve f : X \u2212\u2192 B,\nsuch that the general fiber Xb of f is minimal and smooth and it is log\n1\n3\n. Moreover\ncanonical centre for (X, Dx ) with Dx \u223c \u03bbKX and \u03bb < 2 3 (1\u2212\u01eb)\u03b2\nwe have that the vol(Xb ) < 36 .\nThe goal is to find a section of OX (5KX ) that separates two general\npoints. In the case when the two general points x and y in X do not lie\nin the same fiber, say x \u2208 Xb1 and y \u2208 Xb2 , we will create a section of\nf\u2217 OX (5KX ) that separates f (x) and f (y). For b and b\u2032 general points in B\nconsider a general divisor G \u2208 |m(KX + Xb\u2032 )| for some integer m sufficiently\nlarge and divisible and define F = Db1 + Db2 + 6Db + 4\u22128\u03bb\nm G + (8\u03bb \u2212 5)Xb .\n14\n\n\fThen arguing as in Claim 1 we can guarantee that E = f\u2217 (OX (5KX ) \u2297\n1\nJ (F )) is a vector bundle of positive rank for \u03bb < 1152\nso that \u03b2 \u2265 4355.\n\u2217\nSince 4KX \u2261 Xb + F \u223c f b + F we can apply Lemma 3.4. It follows that\nH 1 (B, f\u2217 (OX (5KX ) \u2297 J (F ))) = 0. Then tensoring the short exact sequence\n0 \u2212\u2192 OB \u2212\u2192 OB (b1 + b2 ) \u2212\u2192 Ob1 \u2295 Ob2 \u2212\u2192 0,\nwith E we see that there is a section of f\u2217 (OX (5KX ) \u2297 J (F )) \u2297 OB (b1 + b2 )\nthat separates b1 and b2 . But then the inclusion\nf\u2217 (OX (5KX ) \u2297 J (F )) \u2297 OB (b1 + b2 ) \u0592\u2192 f\u2217 OX (5KX )\nimplies that the linear system |5KX | separates points that are not on the\nsame general fibre of f .\nSuppose now that x and y lie in the same fiber, say Xb over b \u2208 B. Let\nb\u2032 be another general point and let (Db\u2032 , Xb\u2032 ) be the corresponding pair such\nthat J (Db\u2032 ) \u2282 OX (\u2212Xb\u2032 ). Write KX \u223c A\u2032 + M \u2032 as a sum of an ample and\nan effective divisor. Consider a general divisor G \u2208 |m(KX + Xb )| for some\ninteger m sufficiently large and divisible and define F = 6Db\u2032 +( 4\u22126\u03bb\nm \u2212\u01eb)G+\n(4\u03bb \u2212 5 + \u01eb)Xb\u2032 + \u01ebM \u2032 with \u01eb a small rational number 0 < \u01eb \u226a 1.\nLet \u2206 = D|Xb\u2032 . Observe that J (Xb , F|Xb ) = J (Xb , 6\u2206) is trivial for\n1\n( and this follows as in the proof of Claim 1 and Corollary 2.35\n\u03bb < 864\nof [12]). We can choose such lambda for \u03b2 \u2265 3266. It follows that\nH 0 (Xb , OXb (5KXb ) \u2297 J (Xb , 6\u2206)) \u223c\n= H 0 (Xb , OXb (5KXb )).\nConsider the exact sequence\n0 \u2212\u2192 OX (5KX \u2212 Xb ) \u2297 J (F ) \u2212\u2192 OX (5KX ) \u2297 J (F ) \u2212\u2192 OXb (5KXb ) \u2297 J (F )|Xb \u2212\u2192 0.\n\nSince 5KX \u2212 Xb \u2212 F \u2261 \u01ebA\u2032 by Nadel vanishing (Theorem 2.3) we have a\nsurjection\nH 0 (X, OX (5KX ) \u2297 J (F )) \u2212\u2192 H 0 (Xb , OXb (5KXb ) \u2297 J (F )|Xb ) \u2212\u2192 0.\nObserving that\nH 0 (Xb , OXb (5KXb )) \u223c\n= H 0 (Xb , OXb (5KXb ) \u2297 J (Xb , F|Xb ))\n\u2286 H 0 (Xb , f\u2217 OXb (5KXb ) \u2297 J (F )|Xb ),\n\nand since we have sections in OXb (5KXb ) that separate x and y , we get\nsuch a section in OX (5KX ).\n15\n\n\fReferences\n[1] F.
