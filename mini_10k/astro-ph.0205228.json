We present a description of our numerical code BLAZAR. This code calculates spectra and light\ncurves of blazars during outbursts.

Such shells may represent\nlayers of a shocked plasma, enclosed between the forward and reverse fronts of an internal shock.

Introduction\nOne of the greatest achievements of the recently retired\nCompton Gamma-Ray Observatory (CGRO) is the discovery of gamma ray emission from a subclass of Active\nGalactic Nuclei (AGNs) known as blazars. More than 50\nsuch sources were detected at energies above 100MeV\n(Mukherjee et al. 1997). Energy constraints and \u03b3-ray\nabsorption arguments require that radiation emission in\nblazars must be beamed (Mattox et al. 1993). Indeed,\nit is now widely believed that the entire electromagnetic\nspectrum observed in these objects is dominated by nonthermal radiation produced in a jet pointing close to the\nline of sight (Dondi & Ghisellini 1995). Although roughly\ndivided into two classes: flat spectrum radio quasars\n(FSRQ) and BL Lacs objects, all blazars share common\ncharacteristics: large-amplitude, rapid variability; smooth\ncontinuum emission in all observable bands; and high linear polarization.\nSpectrum of a blazar consists of two broad components\n(von Montigny et al. 1995). The low energy component has\na peak within IR-to-X-ray range and is usually attributed\nto Doppler-boosted synchrotron radiation. The high energy component peaks in the MeV-TeV energy range and\nis very likely produced by inverse-Compton process. Both\ncomponents are highly variable, with time scales ranging from years to a fraction of a day. Analysis of \u03b3-ray\nlight curves seems to suggest that variability patterns of\nblazars are a superposition of short term flares (Magdziarz\n\net al. 1997). The flares detected in different spectral bands\nappear to be correlated (Macomb et al. 1995; Wagner et\nal. 1995; Wehrle et al. 1998). This behavior suggests cospatial production of the high and low energy components\nand indicates that significant fraction of the jet energy is\ndissipated in the localized events at sub-parsec distances\nfrom the center. Such events are likely to arise in internal shocks (Sikora et al. 1994; Spada et al. 2001) or at\nthe sites of the magnetic field reconnection (Romanova &\nLovelace 1992; Blackman 1996).\nBoth the shocks and the reconnection sites provide favorable conditions for efficient acceleration of particles.\nUnfortunately, the present theories of particle acceleration are still not sufficiently developed to provide quantitative predictions regarding such issues as what fraction\nof dissipated energy is used to accelerate particles, how\nmuch power is channeled into relativistic protons vs. relativistic electrons/positrons, and what maximum energy\ncan a particle gain. In particular, it is not possible to deduce solely on theoretical grounds whether protons are\naccelerated to energies sufficient to support \u2013 via inelastic collisions with photons \u2013 the pair cascades, as is suggested by hadronic models (Mannhein & Biermann 1992),\nor if they are \"radiatively\" passive returning all energy\ngained during the dissipative events back to the flow via\nadiabatic expansion. In the latter case, represented by the\nleptonic models, radiation production in blazars is totally\ndominated by electrons and positrons accelerated directly.\n\n\f2\n\nModerski et al.: Radiation from Blazar Jets\n\nThere are several electron/positron acceleration mechanisms which are likely to operate in shocks (Levinson 1996;\nHoshino et al. 1992; McClements et al. 1997; Shimada &\nHoshino 2000; Hoshino & Shimada 2002) and reconnection\nsites (Larrabee et al. 2002; Lyutikov 2002), but such theoretical considerations cannot as yet predict the spectra\nof accelerated particles and their minimum and maximum\nenergies.\nTheories of radiation mechanisms are much better developed. They are quantitative and for a given energy distribution of the accelerated/injected particles, geometry\nand kinematics of the source, and external radiation field\nenvironment, one can make specific predictions regarding\nthe radiation spectra. By confronting those theories with\nobservations, it is possible to verify the model and determine its parameters. Using this approach, one can already\nexclude some radiation scenarios. This concerns e.g. models with pair cascades, which predict X-ray spectra that\nwould be too soft as compared with observations of some\nFSRQ (Sikora & Madejski 2001). Therefore, for these objects, direct electron/positron acceleration mechanism is\nfavored.\nIn leptonic models, both the high-energy and the lowenergy components of the spectrum are produced by the\nsame population of relativistic electrons. At low energies, the emission comes from the synchrotron process,\nwhile at higher energies, it is dominated by the inverse\nCompton scattering. There is still some debate about the\nsource of seed photons for the inverse Compton process.\nThe most obvious choice involves synchrotron photons\nfrom the low energy component. Models based on this\nassumption are called Self-Synchrotron-Compton (SSC)\nmodels. Originally proposed by K\u00f6nigl (1981) to explain\nproduction of X-rays and \u03b3-rays (already detected by\nthen from 3C 273 by COS-B [Swanenburg et al. 1978]),\ncurrently the SSC models prove to be successful in explaining general features of BL Lac objects (Ghisellini &\nMaraschi 1989; Takahashi et al. 1996; Kirk et al. 1998;\nTavecchio et al. 1998; Kino et al. 2002). However, in\nquasars - but also, in some radio selected BL Lac objects, the external radiation fields may be sufficiently\ndense to dominate the Compton cooling of electrons in\na jet (Madejski et al. 1999). Models exploring this hypothesis are called External-Radiation-Compton (ERC)\nmodels. Several sources of photons for external radiation\nfield have been considered: direct disc radiation (Dermer\n& Schlickeiser 1993); diffuse radiation from broad emission\nline (BEL) region (Sikora et al.1994); infra-red radiation\nfrom hot dust (Bla\u017cejowski et al. 2000); or jet synchrotron\nradiation scattered back to the jet by the external gas\n(Ghisellini & Madau 1996).\nIn this paper we present a code developed to simulate non-thermal flares produced by thin shells propagating down a conical jet with relativistic speeds. Such\nshells approximate the geometry of relativistic plasma\nenclosed between the forward and reverse shock fronts\nformed by colliding inhomogeneities in a jet (Sikora et\nal. 2001; Sikora & Madejski 2002). The code is suffi-\n\nciently general to treat radiation processes for any radial distribution of magnetic and external radiation fields,\nand for any electron/positron injection function. It includes both Comptonization of synchrotron radiation and\nComptonization of external radiation, and takes into account adiabatic losses due to 2D conical expansion of the\nshocked plasma sheets. The main limitations of the present\nversion of the code are that Comptonization is treated\nself-consistently only within the Thomson limits, and that\n\u03b3\u03b3-pair production is not included. Since there are observational indications that in FSRQ the \u03b3-ray spectra have a\nhigh energy break in the 4\u221210GeV band (Pohl et al. 1997;\nSikora et al. 2002), while synchrotron spectra are usually\nsteep in the UV band, the above limitations affect only\nmarginally our models of quasars. However, they can be\nsignificant for BL Lac objects, particularly for those bright\nin the TeV band.\nAssumptions and main features of our model, such as\nthe equations describing evolution of the energy distribution of relativistic electrons, radiation processes, relativistic aberration and light travel effects are presented\nin Sect. 2. The numerical code is described in Sect. 3.\nApproximate analytical formulas, expressing the model input parameters as a function of observables, are derived\nin Sect. 4. In Sect. 5 we present results of application of\nour code to model the outburst of 3C279, the best studied quasar in the \u03b3-ray band. The work is summarized in\nSect. 6.\n\n2. The Model\nIn our model a source of the non-thermal radiation is assumed to be a thin shell, propagating down the conical\njet with a constant speed, and radiation is produced by\nrelativistic electrons/positrons, injected into a shell within\na given distance range. This picture approximates the internal shock scenario, where shocks are formed following\ncollisions of inhomogeneities moving with different radial\nvelocities (Sikora et al. 1994; Spada et al. 2001). Structure\nand dynamics of such internal shocks is in general very\ncomplex and depends on a number of parameters, such\nas the relative velocity of inhomogeneities, their densities, temperatures, geometry, and total masses. The shock\nstructure can be double, single (forward or reverse), or can\ninitially it can be double, followed by an evolution into\na single shock (Daigne & Mochkovitch 1998; Bicknell &\nWagner 2002). Regardless, in the case of inhomogeneities\nwhich are cold prior to their collision and which have comparable masses and comparable rest frame densities, the\nconstant speed of the shocked plasma is a good approximation. Small thickness of the shocked plasma shell can\nbe justified, since internal shocks are at most mildly relativistic (Sikora et al. 2001).\n\n2.1. Electron Evolution\nAssuming that electron injection function and energy densities of magnetic field and of external radiation fields are\n\n\fModerski et al.: Radiation from Blazar Jets\n\nuniform across the shell, one can follow evolution of electron energy distribution by solving the kinetic equation\nfor the total population of relativistic electrons, despite\nthe fact that each element of the conically diverging shell\nhas its own rest frame which is different from other frames.\nThat equation can be written in the form (Moderski et\nal. 2000):\n\u0012\n\u0013\nd\u03b3\n\u2202N\u03b3\n\u2202\nN\n+ Q,\n(1)\n=\n\u2212\n\u03b3\n\u2202t\u2032\n\u2202\u03b3\ndt\u2032\nwhere Q \u2261 (dN\u03b3 /dt\u2032 )inj is the electron injection function,\n\u03b3 is the random electron Lorentz factor, d\u03b3/dt\u2032 is the rate\nof the electron energy losses, dt\u2032 = dt/\u0393 is the proper time,\nand \u0393 is the Lorentz factor of the bulk motion of a shell.\nWithin the thin shell approximation, the time derivatives\ncan be replaced with derivatives over the radial\n\u221a distance\nr.

It does not imply that the synchrotron radiation field is isotropic. In general, one must transform the\nsynchrotron radiation from neighbor cells into cell frame\ntaking into account the change in frequency and direction of the incoming photons. However, for a thin shell\n\n\f4\n\nModerski et al.: Radiation from Blazar Jets\n\nand small opening angles of the jet the assumption about\nisotropy of the synchrotron radiation field is a reasonable\napproximation.\n\n2.3.2.

Observed Spectra and Light Curves\n2.3.3. External-Radiation-Compton\nIn the co-moving frame, the external diffuse radiation field\nis strongly anisotropic. Due to relativistic aberration, the\nexternal radiation appears to the jet as mostly incident\nfrom the forward direction. Within the jet, a photon scattered by a relativistic electron follows the direction of motion of that electron. Because of this, the observer will\ndetect preferentially photons that were emitted by the\nelectrons which during the scattering process had their\nmomentum vector pointing at the observer. In such an\napproximation, the energy of the photon scattered into\nthe observer direction is given by (Reynolds 1982):\n\u2032\n(1 + cos \u03b8\u2032 ) ,\n\u03bd \u2032 \u2243 \u03b3 2 \u03bdext\n\n(17)\n\n\u2032\nwhere \u03bdext\n\u2243 \u0393\u03bdext , h\u03bdext is the characteristic energy of\nphotons in the external radiation field (assumed to have\na narrow spectrum), and \u03b8\u2032 is the angle between the bulk\nmotion direction of a given shell segment and direction to\n\nThe monochromatic radiation flux observed at a given instant is\n(1 + z) X \u2202\u03b4L\u03bd [t, \u03b8]\nF\u03bdobs (tobs ) =\n(24)\nd2L\n\u2202\u03a9nobs\n\nwhere\n\n\u2202\u03b4L\u03bd [t, \u03b8]\n\u2202\u03b4L\u2032\u03bd \u2032 [r, \u03b8\u2032 ]\n= D3\n,\n\u2202\u03a9nobs\n\u2202\u03a9\u2032nobs\n\n(25)\n\n\u03bd \u2032 = \u03bd/D = \u03bdobs (1 + z)/D ,\n\n(26)\n\nr=\n\nc\u03b2\u0393\n(t \u2212 t0 ) + r0 ,\n1 \u2212 \u03b2\u0393 cos \u03b8\n\ncos \u03b8 =\n\ncos \u03b8\u2032 + \u03b2\u0393\n,\n1 + \u03b2\u0393 cos \u03b8\u2032\n\nt = tobs /(1 + z) ,\n\n(27)\n(28)\n(29)\n\n\fModerski et al.: Radiation from Blazar Jets\n\nD = \u0393(1 + \u03b2\u0393 cos \u03b8\u2032 ) \u2261\n\n1\n\u0393(1 \u2212 \u03b2\u0393 cos \u03b8)\n\n(30)\n\nand dL is the luminosity distance.

Numerical Implementation\nOur numerical method is similar to that used by Chiaberge & Ghisellini (1999). Electron evolution equation (2)\nis solved with implicit difference scheme adopted from\nChang & Cooper (1970). First, the uniformly spaced logarithmic energy grid is established:\n\u0013 k\u22121\n\u0012\n\u03b3N n\u22121\n\u03b3k = \u03b30\nk = 0, ..., n\n(33)\n\u03b30\nwith energy intervals \u2206\u03b3k = \u03b3k+1/2 \u2212 \u03b3k\u22121/2 . Using a\ndefinition Nki = N\u03b3 (\u03b3k , i\u2206r) we can convert Eq. (2) into\na set of linear equations:\ni+1\ni+1\nAk Nk\u22121\n+ Bk Nki+1 + Ck Nk+1\n= Uki ,\n\n(34)\n\nwhere the coefficients are\nAk = 0 , \u0010 \u0011\n\u2206r\nBk = 1 + d\u03b3\ndr\n\u2206\u03b3k ,\nk\u22121/2\n\u0010 \u0011\n\u2206r\nCk = \u2212 d\u03b3\ndr\n\u2206\u03b3k ,\n\n(35)\n\n5\n\nThere exists an alternative way of solving Eqs (34). If\none assures that the energy grid is sufficiently wide to\nhave N (\u03b3n , i\u2206r) = 0 during the entire evolution, then the\nEq. (34) can be solved recursively from the highest to the\nlowest energies using the relation\nNki+1 =\n\n\u0001\n1\ni+1\nUki \u2212 Ck Nk+1\nBk\n\nk = n \u2212 1, ..., 1\n\n(37)\n\nFor universality, however, we use the full tridag method.\nIt allows the consideration of electron distributions with\nhigh energy tails without performing the calculations for\nunimportant grid points.\nIn order to calculate the electron distribution it is necessary to estimate the electron cooling function (3). This\nrequires the knowledge of the energy density of the synchrotron radiation field which depends on the electron distribution itself. In our code this calculation is done iteratively. Initially u\u2032S = 0 is assumed and the electron distribution is calculated using this value. Then this distribution is used to calculate synchrotron radiation density together with the frequency of synchrotron self absorption.\nThe new value of u\u2032S is used to recalculate the electron\ndistribution. This process is repeated until convergence.\nThe electron distribution is then used to calculate the synchrotron luminosity (10), SSC luminosity (12), and ERC\nluminosity (22). For all integrations we use the Romberg's\nmethod (Press et al. 1992). The advantage of this method\nis that it adjusts itself, and thus only a minimal number\nof calculations is performed to achieve desired accuracy.\nSpecial care must be taken when calculating light curves\nfrom Eq. (24). The radiation reaching the observer at a\ngiven time is a superposition of radiation emitted at different radii, and this in turn depends on \u03b8, which is the\nangle between the direction of motion of a given cell and\nthe direction to the observer (see Eq. (27)).\nOne must also remember that the choice of the cell size\nputs a constraint on the minimum timescale that can be\nprobed with the code. For a given cell size, \u2206\u03b8, the minimum timescale for which spatial homogeneity within the\ncell is maintained equals\n\nk+1/2\n\n\u2206t \u2243 r sin \u03b8j \u2206\u03b8\n\nand the source term is\nUki = Nki +\n\n\u2206r i\nQ .\nc\u03b2\u0393 \u0393 k\n\n(36)\n\nThe system of equations (34) yields a special case of tridiagonal matrix with the upper diagonal equal to zero. It\nis solved numerically by matrix decomposition, forwardand back-substitution. In practice we use tridag subroutine from Numerical Recipes (Press et al. 1992). This\nmethod of solving Eq. (2) is unstable if the sharp cutoffs\nare present in the electron energy distribution function. In\nour case, because the Eq. (3) does not contain the acceleration terms, we avoid this instability by setting the upper\nboundary of the calculation grid to the maximum energy\nof the injected electrons. Another way to avoid sharp cutoffs is to introduce very steep power-law tails to mimic\nthese cutoffs (B\u00f6ttcher & Chiang 2002).\n\n(38)\n\n4. Model Input Parameters\nThe input parameters of the model are:\n\u2013 the distance of the shock formation from the central\nsource, r0 ;\n\u2013 the distance range of shock operation, \u2206rcoll ;\n\u2013 the bulk Lorentz factor of the shock, \u0393;\n\u2013 the energy density of an external diffuse radiation field,\nuext and its characteristic frequency \u03bdext ;\n\u2013 the magnetic field in a shocked plasma, B \u2032 ;\n\u2013 the electron injection function, Q;\n\u2013 the angle between the line of sight and the jet axis, \u03c8obs ;\n\u2013 the half-opening angle of a jet, \u03c8j .\nInitial values of these parameters can be set up by\nusing approximate analytical formulas which relate them\n\n\f6\n\nModerski et al.: Radiation from Blazar Jets\n\n(see Appendix A for justification of such an injection function).\nDue to radiative and adiabatic energy losses of electrons, their energy distribution evolves with time. The\nstrong energy dependence of the radiative energy losses\nof electrons causes steepening of the electron energy distribution. It takes place at \u03b3 > \u03b3c , where \u03b3c is the energy\nat which the time scale of electron energy losses,\n\u03b3\n\u03b3\n,\n(41)\n\u2243\nt\u2032cool \u2243\n\u2032\n\u2032\n|d\u03b3/dt |\n|d\u03b3/dt |rad + |d\u03b3/dt\u2032 |ad\nis equal to the lifetime of a shock\nt\u2032sh \u2243\n\ntfl D\n.\n1+z\n\n(42)\n\nDuring \u03b3-ray dominated outbursts the radiative energy\nlosses are dominated by the ERC process, and therefore\nt\u2032cool = t\u2032sh gives\n\u03b3c =\nFig. 1. A schematic picture illustrating the integration\nprocedure. A thin shell of electrons enclosed within the\nhalf-opening angle of the jet, \u03c8j is divided into cells, each\n\u03b4\u03a9j thick. Each such cell contains \u03b4N\u03b3 electrons. The\nobserver is located at the angle \u03c8obs from the jet axis.\nIntegration is performed by summation over \u03b8 contributions from cells located at different radii.\nto the observable quantities. Depending on the available\nobservables, a different set of equations must be used.\nMost useful observables used to model the short term\n(1 \u2212 10 days), \u03b3-ray dominated outbursts in FSRQ are:\nthe time scale of the outburst/flare, tfl (more specifically, its growing part); radiation fluxes at the low-energy\nand high-energy spectral peaks, denoted respectively as\nFLE \u2261 \u03bdLE F\u03bdLE and FHE \u2261 \u03bdHE F\u03bdHE ; location of the spectral break between the X-ray and \u03b3-ray spectral portions,\n\u03bdc ; radiation flux, \u03bd\u22c6 F\u03bd\u22c6 , at some \u03bd\u22c6 > \u03bdc ; the spectral\nindex of the HE component at \u03bd > \u03bdc (as measured, e.g.,\nby EGRET in its bandpass); and the total radiation flux\nof broad emission lines, FBEL (Celotti et al. 1997). For the\nsake of simplicity of analytical formulas which will be used\nto derive the initial model parameters as a function of observables, both the light travel effects (due to finite size of\nthe source) and the Doppler dispersion effects (due to the\n\"conical\" expansion of a shell) are ignored. In addition,\nwe assume that: during the outbursts the production of\n\u03b3-rays is dominated by the ERC process; B \u2032 \u221d 1/r; and\nelectrons are accelerated in the shock at a constant rate\nand with a single power-law energy distribution,\nQ = K\u03b3 \u2212p .\nfor \u03b3min = 1 and\ns\n1 \u03bdmax (1 + z)\n\u03b3max =\nD\n\u03bdBEL\n\n(39)\n\n(40)\n\nme c (1 + z)f (k)\n,\n2\u03c3T tfl u\u2032ext D\n\n(43)\n\nwhere f (k) = (1 + 3k)/(2(1 + k)) and k \u2261 r0 /\u2206rcoll .\nAt \u03b3 = \u03b3c the power law energy distribution of electrons, N\u03b3 \u221d \u03b3 \u2212s , changes the slope from s = p at \u03b3 < \u03b3c\n(slow cooling regime) to s = p + 1 at \u03b3 > \u03b3c (fast cooling regime). Such a change of slope results from the fact\nthat in the fast cooling regime (trad < tsh ) the number ofRelectrons is saturated by the radiative losses, i.e.\nN\u03b3 \u223c \u03b3 Q d\u03b3/|d\u03b3/dt\u2032| \u223c Qt\u2032rad . (Note that \u03b3c is changing\nduring the shock progression and that its particular value\ngiven by Eq. (43) is for the instant when the collision is\ncomplete.)\nThe break at \u03b3c is reflected in the ERC spectral component at\n\u03bdc,obs =\n\n\u03b3c2 D2 \u03bdext\n.\n1+z\n\n(44)\n\naround which the electromagnetic spectrum changes the\nslope by \u2206\u03b1 \u2243 0.5. We identify this break as the one\nobserved more or less directly in FSRQ between 1 and\n30 MeV.

Since\nthe ERC to synchrotron luminosity ratio is \u221d (D/\u0393)2\n(see Eq. (46)), the view angles \u03c8obs \u2264 1/\u0393 are expected\nfor strongly \u03b3-ray dominated FSRQ. In such conditions\nD/\u0393 = 1 ranges from 2 for the observer located on the jet\naxis to 1 for the observer located at \u03c8obs = 1/\u0393.\nThe value of k is also expected to be of the order\nof unity, as suggested by roughly symmetrical profiles of\nflares (see, e.g., Sikora et al. 2001). Regarding the jet opening angle, we know they are very small (1 - 3 degrees) on\nkilo-parsec scales, but can be much larger on parsec/subparsec scales (see, e.g. Lobanov 1998). The specific value of\n\u03c8j can be determined from the value of flux in the soft/mid\nX-ray bands, provided that the latter is dominated by the\nSSC process. Since we do not follow the SSC process in our\nanalytical approach, and because other model parameters\nare not very sensitive to \u03c8j , the numerical simulations can\nbe started with any 0 < \u03c8j < 1/\u0393 and then corrected in\nsubsequent iterations.\nIn our method to calculate the model input parameters, we do not take advantage of the ratio of frequencies, \u03bdHE to \u03bdLE . This ratio often has been used to calculate the bulk Lorentz factor. If it were to be incorporated\ninto our method to calculate \u0393, this would give an equation for k. However, \u03bdF\u03bd spectra around their maxima\nare quite flat and therefore, both \u03bdHE and \u03bdLE are subject to very large uncertainties. Furthermore, in FSRQ\nthe synchrotron peak is located in the far IR and rarely is\nobserved directly.\nAn additional difficulty is the fact that the amplitudes of the \u03b3-ray flares are usually much larger than the\namplitudes of the synchrotron flares. This suggests that\nsynchrotron component is strongly diluted by the quasisteady radiation produced at larger distances in a jet. We\ncan deal with this case in our method by using in the\nEq. (47) \u2206Fsyn instead of Fsyn , where \u2206Fsyn is the amount\nby which synchrotron flux increases during the high amplitude \u03b3-ray flare. For the instances where the dilution is so\nlarge that \u2206Fsyn cannot be determined observationally, as\nan alternative approach, one can use the observed correlation of the soft/mid X-ray flux with the \u03b3-ray flux. When\nthe soft/mid X-ray flux is interpreted as produced by the\nSSC process, one can estimate the magnetic field intensity\nvia an iterative process, which relies on the match of the\nmodel SSC radiation spectrum against that measured in\nthe X-ray band.\n\n\f8\n\nModerski et al.: Radiation from Blazar Jets\n\n5. Application: blazar 3C 279\n3C 279 is one of the most extensively observed blazars.\nSeveral times it was a target of multi-wavelength campaigns. The most fruitful campaign took place in the beginning of 1996 when the blazar underwent an enormous\n\u03b3-ray flare. This event was monitored nearly simultaneously at many frequencies (Wehrle et al. 1998) and is analyzed below using our code.\n\n5.1. Input parameters\n3C279 is located at a redshift z = 0.538, which for the\ncurrently favored cosmology (\u03a9\u03bb \u2243 0.7, \u03a9m \u2243 0.3 and\nh \u2243 0.66) gives the luminosity distance dL \u2243 1028 cm.\nThe data collected during the February 1996 flare (Wehrle\net al. 1998; Hartman et al. 2001) give the h\u03bdc \u2243 20MeV\nand \u03bd\u22c6 F\u03bd\u22c6 \u2243 2.75 \u00d7 10\u221210 erg s\u22121 cm\u22122 , where \u03bd\u22c6 \u2243\n1023 Hz. The slope of the \u03b3-ray spectrum during the flare\nin the EGRET band was \u03b1\u03b3 \u2243 0.97 which from Eq. (54)\ngives p \u2243 1.9. Although a reliable EGRET spectrum is\navailable for this object, the high energy break is not directly observed, so we set h\u03bdmax = 20GeV. Estimate of\nFBEL is very uncertain. Analysis based on relative line intensities by Celotti et al. (1997) gives LBEL = 3.4\u00d71044erg\ns\u22121 . However, during outbursts this luminosity can be\neven larger (Koratkar et al. 1998). For our analysis we\nset LBEL = 6.8 \u00d7 1044 erg s\u22121 . The average photon energy\nof external radiation field is taken to be h\u03bdext = h\u03bdBEL =\n10eV. Luminosity of the accretion disc, obtained using the\ndirect observations of the UV bump during the low state\nof 3C 279 (Pian et al. 1999), is LUV \u2243 2.7 \u00d7 1045 erg s\u22121 .\nTime scale of the flare is tfl \u2243 1 day (Lawson et al. 1999).\nAnalysis of the lightcurves of the February 1996 flare\nat different energies (Wehrle et al. 1998) shows that despite the very large rise of flux in the \u03b3-ray band, the\nflare was almost undetectable at low energies, especially\nfrom radio to optical. This suggests that synchrotron component is significantly diluted, and synchrotron radiation\nproduced during the flare is hidden by a more steady component. For this reason we initially set Fsyn /FERC = 10\u22122 .\nThe above set of observables yields (for the assumed\nk = 1 and D/\u0393 = 2) the following input parameters:\nu\u2032ext (rf ) \u2243 0.21erg cm\u22123 (\u2190 Eq. (45)); B \u2032 (rf ) \u2243 0.46\nGauss (\u2190 Eq. (47)); rBEL \u2243 4.0 \u00d7 1017 cm (\u2190 Eq. (51));\nrf \u2243 4.2 \u00d7 1017 cm (\u2190 Eq. (52)); \u0393 \u2243 7.9 (\u2190 Eq. (53));\nK \u2243 3.4 \u00d7 1048 s\u22121 (\u2190 Eq. (57)); \u03b3max \u2243 3.5 \u00d7 103 (\u2190\nEq.( 40)). We have also set \u03c8j = 0.12 \u2243 1/\u0393.\n\n5.2. Average spectrum\nWe first apply our model to the average spectrum of the\nblazar 3C 279 during the February 1996 flare. The result\nis presented in Fig. 2. The fine-tuning of the input parameters requires substantial change only of of the normalization of electron injection function, K. We have achieved\nthe best results setting K = 9.5\u00d71049. This difference can\neasily be understood by examining Eq. (57). This quan-\n\nFig. 2. The average spectrum of the blazar 3C 279 during\nthe February 1996 flare. Data points are from Hartman\net al. (2001). Thick, solid line shows the averaged spectrum of our model (see text for parameters). Thin lines\nrepresent various components of the spectrum.\ntity is very sensitive to D/\u0393. The calculation of the input\nparameters assumes that the source is point-like and thus\nthat the whole radiation is beamed toward the observer.\nDue to the conical structure of the jet the Doppler factor\ndecreases to the edge of the jet, and thus more electrons\nare required to produce the observed luminosity. The minor correction was applied also for the magnetic field. The\nbest result yields B \u2032 (rf ) = 0.3 Gauss. For the calculation\nwe also set \u03c8obs = 0.05, but the averaged spectrum is not\nvery sensitive to this value. The averaging was performed\nbetween r = r0 and r = 3r0 .\nLarge discrepancy between the data and our model in\nthe low energy component arises from the fact that the\nsynchrotron radiation during the studied flare is substantially diluted, presumably by radiation produced at larger\ndistances in a jet.\n\n5.3. Light-curves\nFig. (3) presents the simulated light-curves together with\nobservational data points. Two curves are shown: one is\nthe \u03bdF\u03bd flux at 400 MeV (EGRET range) and the second\nis the integrated 2-20 keV flux (XTE range). For both\nlightcurves the steady components were added. These\ncomponents were estimated from the pre-flare observations. In the case of X-ray light curve the quiescent emission is Fq = 1.23\u00d710\u221211erg s\u22121 cm\u22122 (Lawson et al. 1999)\nand contributes up to 25% of the peak flux. Thus for\nthe X-ray band, where the radiation is presumably dominated by the SSC process, the contribution of the quies-\n\n\fModerski et al.: Radiation from Blazar Jets\n\n9\n\nFig. 3. \u03b3-ray (upper panel \u2013 \u03bdF\u03bd flux at 400 MeV) and\nX-ray (lower panel \u2013 integrated 2-10 keV flux) light-curves\nof the blazar 3C 279 during the Feb '96 flare.

For gamma-rays we estimated\nthe steady component from data points before 30th day of\n1996. Its value is \u03bdF\u03bd,q = 24.7 \u00d7 10\u221211 erg s\u22121 cm\u22122 and\nits contribution to the peak flux is only 12%.\nThe agreement between the data and our model is\nremarkable taking into account the relative simplicity of\nthe model and complexity of the real phenomena as suggested by, e.g., the gamma-ray light-curve. The discrepancy at the rising part of the X-ray light curve suggests an existence of the soft X-ray precursors caused by\nComptonization of the external radiation by cold electrons\n(Sikora & Madejski 2002).\n\nof systematic error of 0.1 (Lawson et al. 1999). Even with\nthe errors taken into account, the observations seem to\ndisagree with results presented in lower left panel of the\nFig. 4. However, we note that in this range, the influence\nof the quiescent component is significant, and the proper\ncomparison would require the analysis which is beyond\nthe scope of this paper. The steady component may also\ninfluence the spectrum at \u03b3-ray energies and cause the discrepancy for observations outside of the maximum of the\nflare.\n\n5.4. Spectral evolution\nIn order to demonstrate spectral changes during the flare,\nin Fig. 4 we present the evolution of the spectral index\n\u03b1 (defined by F\u03bd \u221d \u03bd \u2212\u03b1 ) at two energies: 400 MeV and\n6 keV. Two plots are presented for each energy: one is\nthe power law spectral index \u03b1 as a function of time, the\nsecond is the so called hardness\u2013intensity diagram showing\nthe spectral index as a function of the flux.\nUnfortunately, the comparison with observations in\nthis case is difficult. There are no observations of the\nspectral index variation during the flare by EGRET. The\nreported slope of the \u03b3-ray spectrum for the event was\n\u03b1\u03b3 = 0.97 which is in excellent agreement with the middle part of the curve in upper left corner of the Fig. 4.\nFor the XTE observations, \u03b1x ranges from 0.68 to 1.26,\nbut the errors are large, and there is a possible evidence\n\n5.5. Evolution of Electron Distribution\nIn Fig. 5 we present the time evolution of energy distribution of electrons during the flare. The evolution is followed\nfrom r = r0 till the electrons reach the distance 3 r0 . At\nthe very beginning of the flare, the number of all electrons increases, then the number of the most relativistic\nelectrons starts to saturate being balanced by the radiative energy losses. After the injection of electrons stops,\nthe high energy tail of the electron distribution decays\nvery rapidly, while only small changes can be noticed at\nlowest energies.\nThe characteristic feature of this evolving electron\nspectrum is the spectral break, which moves from higher\nto lower values as evolution proceeds. At a distance r = 2\nr0 , where injection stops and the \u03b3 2 N\u03b3 reaches maximum,\nthe approximate location of the break is \u03b3 \u2243 65. The value\ncalculated from Eq. (43) is somewhat larger (\u03b3c \u2243 105)\nand this is because the approximate analytical formula\n\n\f10\n\nModerski et al.: Radiation from Blazar Jets\n\nlifetime of the source, and then Eq.

Evolution of the electron energy distribution during the February 1996 flare of the blazar 3C 279. Step\nbetween the curves is \u2206r = 0.2r0 .\nfor \u03b3c does not include synchrotron and SSC energy losses.\nAt energies lower than \u03b3c (the slow cooling regime), the\npower-law energy distribution of electrons N\u03b3 \u223c \u03b3 \u2212s has\nan index s = p, while for \u03b3 \u226b \u03b3c (the fast cooling regime)\nthe slope of the electron distribution (due to efficient radiative cooling) is steeper by unity, i.e., s = p + 1. The\nlatter effect is mostly obscured by the effect of the break\nat \u03b3max .\n\n6. Summary\nIn this article, we have presented our numerical code\nBLAZAR which simulates light-curves and spectra of\nblazars during flares. In the code, the structure of the\nsource responsible for the production of flares is approximated by thin uniform shells, propagating with constant speed down the conical jet. The shells are filled\nwith relativistic electrons/positrons, which are injected\nwithin a given distance range at a constant rate. Evolution\nof the electron energy distribution is treated by the kinetic/continuity equation, given by Eq. (1). In that equation, the electron injection function Q is separated from\nthe cooling term. This simplification can be justified provided time scale of acceleration of electrons is much\nshorter than time scale of their cooling and time scale of\nthe shock operation. Since in FSRQ, which are main targets of the present version of the code, the cooling break\nis located at \u03bdc \u226a \u03bdmax , the above assumption is satisfied\nfor all electrons except for those with \u03b3 \u223c \u03b3max . However,\nthis condition may not be satisfied for the X-ray selected\nBL Lac objects, including TeV blazars. In these objects\ntime scale of acceleration can well be comparable to the\n\nVery short gyration time scale (as compared with\nthe radiative energy losses) plus very likely presence of\nchaotic magnetic fields (because of MHD turbulence induced around the shock fronts) justify the assumption\nregarding the isotropic distribution of the electron momenta, and therefore regarding the isotropy of the synchrotron and SSC emission in the source co-moving frame.\nHowever, the isotropy approximation doesn't apply to\nComptonization of external radiation. This is because due\nto relativistic aberration, the external diffuse radiation is\nseen by the source as strongly beamed from the front.\nBecause of this, the scattered radiation is anisotropic - it is\nbeamed into the source propagation direction already even\nin the source co-moving frame. This anisotropy, originally\npointed out by Dermer (1995), is self-consistently treated\nin our code. Radiative effects of the ERC anisotropy, often ignored in other models, are particularly strong for\n\u03c8obs > 1/\u0393.\nAnother advantage of our code is that it includes the\nadiabatic energy losses in the kinetic equation for electrons. In our model they are related to the \"conical\" expansion of a shell. Inclusion of adiabatic losses is very important in calculating properly the location of the cooling\nbreak \u03bdc . Those losses also strongly affect the light curves\nof flares observed at \u03bd < \u03bdc (Sikora et al. 2001).\nAs an example of application of our code, we presented\nin \u00a75 the results of our modeling of the short term outburst observed in 3C 279 in February 1996 (Wehrle et\nal. 1998). Our results demonstrate very strong dilution of\nthe synchrotron radiation component in this object. This\neffect, often ignored completely by other models, can be\nquite common, as suggested by much smaller amplitudes\nof optical flares than of \u03b3-ray flares (Ulrich et al. 1997).\nFor such objects, detailed fitting of the synchrotron spectrum in terms of the homogeneous/one-component model\nis inappropriate and can lead to very large errors in the\nmodel parameters. Our method, albeit approximate, takes\ninto account the dilution effect.\nIt is worth noting that the code \"BLAZAR\" was already used in several previous papers. It was applied\nto the study the dependence of amplitude of flares in\nblazars on the frequency, on the ratio r0 /\u2206rcoll , and on the\ntime profile of an electron injection function Q(t\u2032 ) (Sikora\net al. 2001). The code was also used to study the relative\nrole of hot dust and broad emission line region as a source\nof the external seed photons for the inverse Compton process in a jet (Bla\u017cejowski et al.) and was applied to demonstrate the possible unification between the MeV-blazars\nand GeV-blazars (Sikora et al. 2002). Finally, after some\nsmall modifications allowing to model the radiation from\nthe shells propagating with a variable bulk Lorentz factor\nand supplementing the code by relevant dynamical equations, it was used to study the effect of lateral expansion\n\n\fModerski et al.: Radiation from Blazar Jets\n\nof the collimated GRBs, possibly resulting in the observed\nbreaks in their light-curves (Moderski et al. 2000).\nIn the present form, the code doesn't include the KleinNishina effects nor the \u03b3-ray absorption and e+ e\u2212 pair\ncreation. In FSRQ the Klein-Nishina effects become important at \u03b3 > a few \u00d7 104 /\u0393, while the absorption \u2013 at\nh\u03bd \u2265 20GeV, both due to interactions with external BEL\nphotons. The high energy break at h\u03bd \u223c 4 \u2212 10GeV, suggested by EGRET observations of FSRQ during the \u03b3-ray\nflares(Pohl et al. 1997), and the steep UV spectra seem\nto indicate that energy distribution of electrons/positrons\nhas a break or cutoff around \u03b3 \u223c a few \u00d7 104 /\u0393 (see\nAppendix A). Hence, the KN and \u03b3\u03b3 pair production\neffects are expected to be at most marginal. The above\nlimitations, particularly the first one, are expected to be\nrelevant only for BL Lac objects, in particular for those\nwith strong TeV emission. In the case of our model of\nthe 3C 279 flare \u0393\u03b3max h\u03bdBEL /me c2 \u2243 0.5 and hvmax =\n20GeV, so the effects are expected to be negligible.\nAcknowledgements.

The low energy tails\nobserved in several FSRQ do not show any change of the\nslope down to the lowest X-ray energies, and this seems\nto indicate that the power-law electron injection function extends down to \u03b3min \u2264few (Tavecchio et al. 1998;\nSikora et al. 2002). This is independently supported by\nthe detection of circular polarization in radio cores of some\nquasars (Homan et al. 2001), provided such polarization\nis generated by the Faraday conversion process (Wardle\net al. 1998; Ruszkowski & Begelman 2002).\nIt is less clear how electron injection function behaves\nat the highest energies and what is the maximum energy of injected electrons. EGRET data of FSRQ during\nflares suggest existence of a high-energy break at 4 \u2212 10\nGeV (Pohl et al. 1997). This high-energy break cannot\nbe caused by the Klein-Nishina effect, because in the fast\ncooling regime, the luminosity of the Compton component\nis determined by the electron injection function and reduction of the Compton scattering cross-section in the KleinNishina regime can be substantially compensated by the\nrespective increase of the electron densities. In particular,\nfor electron injection function \u221d \u03b3 \u22122 the Klein-Nishina\nportion of the Compton spectrum has exactly the same\nspectral index, \u03b1 = 1, as in the Thomson regime (Zdziarski\n& Krolik 1993). The high-energy break also cannot be produced by absorption of \u03b3-rays by external photons. This is\nbecause the radiative environment is transparent for photons detected within the EGRET band (it becomes opaque\nonly for h\u03bd \u2265 20 GeV, due to absorption of such photons\nby optical/UV broad emission lines). Hence, the break in\n4 \u2212 10 GeV band, if real, must be related to the break in\nthe electron injection function, at \u03b3 \u223c a few \u00d7 104 /\u0393.\nIs the injection function extending much above that\nbreak, but with a steeper slope as suggested by observations of the so called MeV-blazars (Sikora et al. 2002),\nor, there is a cutoff? One can try to answer that question by studying the spectra in the UV band, where the\nhigh energy tails of the synchrotron component dominate.\nHowever, the task is not easy, because synchrotron radiation in this band can be affected by several factors: by\nextinction in the host galaxy; by flattening of energy distribution of highest energy electrons due to Compton scatterings in the KN regime (Dermer & Atoyan 2002) and by\n\n\u03b3\u03b3 pair production; and, as in the case of 3C 279, by dilution of the synchrotron component by radiation produced\nat other locations in a jet. Hence, the possible extension\nof the injection function up to energies \u03b3 \u226b a few \u00d7 104 /\u0393\ncan be verified observationally in FSRQ only after the\nlaunch of the GLAST satellite in 2006.\nFortunately, the basic features of the current model\nof FSRQ as adopted here are not very sensitive to the\npresence and details of steep high energy tails of the injection function, and, in order to reproduce the spectra\nat the level of detail required by the current data, it is\nsufficient to use a single power-law injection function as a\nfirst approximation.\n\nAppendix B: Broad emission line region\nReverberation mappings indicate that the BEL region\nin AGNs is geometrically thick, with rmax /rmin > 30\n(Peterson 1993). The 3D structure of the BEL region is\nstill not fully understood, and in our code is assumed to be\nspherical. We approximate the radial distribution of BEL\nluminosity by two power-law functions which join at rBEL\nwhere the luminosity has a peak, i.e.\n\u2202LBEL\n(r) =\n\u2202 ln r\n\u001a\n\u2202LBEL\nfor r < rBEL\n(r/rBEL )q1\n=\n(B.1)\n(rBEL ) \u00d7\n\u2212q2\nfor r > rBEL\n(r/r\n)\n\u2202 ln r\nBEL\nR\nwhere from LBEL = (\u2202LBEL /\u2202r)dr\nq1 q2\n\u2202LBEL\nLBEL .\n(rBEL ) =\n\u2202 ln r\nq1 + q2\n\n(B.2)\n\nand q1 > 0 and q2 > 0. In the case of a smooth transition\nfrom the BEL region to the narrow emission lines region,\none can expect q2 \u223c 0.5. The value of q1 is very uncertain\nand, in order to minimize number of parameters, we adopt\nq1 = q2 = 0.5.\n\n\f"}
