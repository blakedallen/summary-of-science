Scientific rationale\n\u03b1 Cen A (G2V) and B (K1V) offer the unique possibility to study the\nstellar physics at play in conditions just slightly different from the solar\nones. Their masses bracket nicely the Sun's value, while they are slightly\nolder. In spite of their high interest, proximity and brightness, the two\nmain components have never been resolved by long baseline stellar\ninterferometry, due to their particularly southern position in the sky.\nTheir angular diameters were measured recently using the VLTI, and\nwe have used them to constrain numerical models of these stars.\nProcyon is also a binary star, with a white dwarf companion orbiting the main component in 40 years.

However, reproducing its position in the\nhr diagram has been recognized as of great difficulty (Guenther & Demarque 1993) using the classical constraints (metallicity, temperature,\nbrightness). The addition of the asteroseismic and interferometric observational results allows to narrow very significantly the uncertainties\nof the evolutionary models.\n\n2. Interferometric observations\nFor all our interferometric observations, we used the VLT Interferometer with its commissioning instrument, VINCI (Kervella et al. 2003c),\na two telescopes beam combiner operating in the K band (2.0-2.2\n\u03bcm). This instrument measures the squared visibility (V 2 ) of the interferometric fringes. It is related to the angular diameter of the star\nthrough the Zernike-Van Cittert theorem. Fig. 1 and 2 illustrate the\nV 2 measurements that we obtained on \u03b1 Cen A & B, and the best-fit\nmodels that allowed us to derive their limb darkened angular sizes:\n8.511 \u00b1 0.020 and 6.001 \u00b1 0.034 mas (Kervella et al. 2003a). Coupled\nwith the Hipparcos parallax of 747.1 \u00b1 1.2 mas (S\u00f6derhjelm 1999), this\ntranslates into linear radii of 1.224 \u00b1 0.003 R\u2299 and 0.863 \u00b1 0.005 R\u2299 ,\nrespectively.\nUsing the same method (Fig. 3), we obtain an angular diameter of\n\u03b8LD = 5.448 \u00b1 0.053 mas, and a linear photospheric radius of 2.048 \u00b1\n0.025 R\u2299 for Procyon A.\n\nKervella.tex; 29/10/2018; 0:49; p.2\n\n\fModeling of \u03b1 Cen and Procyon from VLTI observations\n\n3\n\n1.4%\n\nCalibrated squared visibility\n\n1.2%\n\n1.0%\n\n0.8%\n\n0.6%\n\n0.4%\n\n0.2%\n\n0.0%\n56\n\n58\n\n60\n62\nProjected baseline (m)\n\n64\n\n66\n\nFigure 2.

Method\nWe have computed a series of models using the CESAM evolutionary\ncode (Morel 1997). The evolution of each star was computed starting\nfrom the homogeneous ZAMS corresponding to their pre-estimated\nmasses. As both \u03b1 Cen and Procyon are visual binary stars with well\n\nKervella.tex; 29/10/2018; 0:49; p.3\n\n\f4\n\nP. Kervella et al.\n\nknown orbits, it was possible to use a precise value of their masses for\nthe input of our models. Each model (see e.g. Table I) corresponds to\na different evolutionary track in the hr diagram.\nThe models were considered acceptable when their evolutionary\ntrack reached the center of the uncertainty domain defined by the\nphotometric, spectroscopic and interferometric constraints. The constraint imposed by the linear radius R and the effective temperature\nTeff is illustrated in Fig. 4 by the hatched parallelogram, while the\nconstraint imposed by Teff and the luminosity L is illustrated by the\ndashed rectangle. The surface of the shaded area is much smaller than\nthe \"classical\" uncertainty domain, and it emphazises the advantage\nof using the measured R instead of L which depends of photometric\ncalibrations and bolometric corrections.\n3.2. Procyon\nProcyon was modeled using the parameters listed in Table I. Of the\nmodels that were tested, our model a succeeds the best in satisfying\nsimultaneously all the observational constraints. Model c, based on a\nlarger mass of M = 1.50 M\u2299 , is clearly rejected by the mean asteroseismic large frequency spacing \u2206\u03bd0 (see further for definition), as\nits predicted value 56.4 \u03bcHz is incompatible with the value of 54 \u03bcHz\nmeasured by Mart\u00ecc et al. (2001). Model b was computed without microscopic diffusion. It is still marginally compatible with the observational\nconstraints, and it is older than model a by 400 Myr.\nOur model a shows that using the given set of parameters and given\nphysics, Procyon A is currently finishing to burn its central hydrogen,\nand is at the phase where the convective core is disappearing. The\nerror on the measured radius gives a narrow uncertainty of 10 Myr\non the deduced age. Provencal et al. (2002) have discussed the cooling\ntime of the WD Procyon B and found that the progenitor ended its\nlifetime 1.7\u00b1 0.1 Gyr ago. We derive an age of 2 314 Myr for Procyon A.\nSubtracting the cooling age of the WD companion to our determination\nof the age of Procyon A leads to a lifetime of about 600 Myr for the\nprogenitor of Procyon B. This indicates that the mass of the progenitor\nis approximately 2.5 M\u2299 . This value yields in turn a mass of \u223c 0.57M\u2299\nfor the core of the corresponding Thermal-Pulsating-AGB star (for\nZ=0.020) (Bressan et al. 1993), which is the minimum possible value\nfor the final mass of the WD (see also Jeffries 1997). This estimate of\n0.57 M\u2299 agrees very well with the mass of Procyon B that we deduced\nfrom Girard et al. (2000) using the Hipparcos parallax. We note that the\nage obtained with model c is younger than the cooling age of Procyon B.\n\nKervella.tex; 29/10/2018; 0:49; p.4\n\n\f5\n\nModeling of \u03b1 Cen and Procyon from VLTI observations\n\nTable I.

For example, other\nlinear combinations of frequencies such as the small frequency spacings\n(see e.g. Gough 1991) will constrain the age and the mass of the star.\nLarge uncertainties also come from the adopted chemical abundance\nmixture Zs which is still rather uncertain. Only a few chemical element abundances are measured today and most of them with a low\naccuracy. This uncertainty on Zs is the largest source of error on the\nestimated initial helium content Yi and on the age of Procyon.

Model a is the most probable model for this star (see text).\n\n3.3. \u03b1 Centauri\nAs emphasized by Th\u00e9venin et al. (2002), the seismic observations give\nstrong constraints on masses and on the age of the system when combined with spectro-photometric measurements. To achieve this, one\nderives from the set of oscillation frequencies, one \"large\" and two\n\"small\" frequency spacings. The large frequency spacing is a difference between frequencies of modes with consecutive radial order n:\n\u2206\u03bdl (n) \u2261 \u03bdn,l \u2212 \u03bdn\u22121,l . In the high frequency range, i.e. large radial\norders, \u2206\u03bdl is almost constant with a mean value \u2206\u03bd0 , strongly related\nto the mean density of the star, i.e. to the mass and the radius. The\nsmall separations are very sensitive to the physical conditions in the\ncore of the star and consequently to its age. These frequencies measured\nfor the star \u03b1 Cen A have led to decrease the masses of the stellar\nsystem, leading to the following values: MA = 1.100 \u00b1 0.006 M\u2299 and\nMB = 0.907\u00b10.006 M\u2299 (Th\u00e9venin et al. 2002) close to those adopted by\nGuenther & Demarque (2000). The mass of the B component departs\nsignificantly by 3% from the value published by Pourbaix et al. (2002).\nUsing radial velocity measurements, Pourbaix et al. (2002) have\nderived the masses of each components (MA = 1.105 \u00b1 0.007 M\u2299 ,\nMB = 0.934\u00b10.006 M\u2299 ). We note that Thoul et al. (2003) have recently\nproposed a model of the binary system using these masses and spectrophotometric constraints different from that of Th\u00e9venin et al. (2002).\nThey were able to reproduce the seismic frequencies of \u03b1 Cen A, but the\n\nKervella.tex; 29/10/2018; 0:49; p.6\n\n\fModeling of \u03b1 Cen and Procyon from VLTI observations\n\n7\n\nFigure 5. Evolutionary tracks of \u03b1 Cen B in the hr diagram. The line on the\nright corresponds to a mixing length of \u03bb = 0.96 and M = 0.909 M\u2299 , the line\non the left corresponds to the values published by Th\u00e9venin et al. (2002): \u03bb = 0.98,\nM = 0.907 M\u2299 .\n\nmodel they propose does not take into account the helium and heavy\nelements diffusion.\nThe masses derived by Th\u00e9venin et al. (2002), MA = 1.100 \u00b1 0.006\nand MB = 0.907\u00b10.006 M\u2299 allowed us to compute evolutionary models\nthat match simultaneously all constraints, including the linear diameter\nand asteroseismic large frequency spacing. These modifications do not\nchange the calibration of \u03b1 Cen A. We took care in this process to keep\nthe star B in its error box on the hr diagram (Fig. 5). It results from\nthis new mass a diameter that is closer to the interferometric one:\n0.863 D\u2299 or 5.999 \u00b1 0.050 mas (parallax from S\u00f6derhjelm 1999). The\neffective temperature is found to be 5262 K, identical to the adopted\nspectroscopic value Teff = 5260 K. Our results confirm that the mass\nof the B component is probably close to 0.907 M\u2299 , as reported by\nTh\u00e9venin et al. (2002).\nAs shown on Fig. 5, it is possible to refine the agreement by changing\nslightly the hypothesis of the model, in particular for B. The future\navailability of the large frequency spacing of \u03b1 Cen B will complete the\ncalibration of the system. While B is still on the Main Sequence with an\nhydrogen fraction at center of Xcenter = 0.43, \u03b1 Cen A is currently near\nthe end (Xcenter = 0.18), owing to its larger mass. This also explains\nits larger diameter compared to the lower Main Sequence M-R relation\n(Kervella et al. 2003d).\n\nKervella.tex; 29/10/2018; 0:49; p.7\n\n\f8\n\nP.
