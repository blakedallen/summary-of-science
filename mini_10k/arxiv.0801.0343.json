The speed of this evolution is boosted in presence of a\nlarge fraction of cold and dissipative gas component. When the visible matter\ndominates over the whole disk, angular momentum is exchanged between gas\nand stars only. The gas is driven towards the center by bars, stalled transiently\nin resonance rings, and driven further by embedded bars, which it contributes\nto destroy. From a small-scale molecular torus, the gas can then inflow from\nviscous torques, dynamical friction, or m = 1 perturbations. In the weakened\nbar phases, multiple-speed spiral patterns can develop and help the galaxy to\naccrete external gas flowing from cosmic filaments. The various phases of secular\nevolution are illustrated by numerical simulations.\n\n1.\n1.1.\n\nBars, gas flows and secular evolution\nBar formation and evolution\n\nNon-axisymmetries and in particular bars are the motor of secular evolution, in\ntransferring the angular momentum in galaxies. In the 80' and 90', numerical\nsimulations established how bars formed, in pure stellar disks, without any dark\nmatter haloes, or embedded in rigid halo components: the angular momentum\nwas exchanged within the disk, the outer parts gaining the momentum from the\ninner parts. This exchange occured mainly at bar formation, the bar pattern\nspeed slowing down slightly, while the stellar orbits in the bar were more and\nmore elongated, corresponding to a lower precessing rate. Once formed, the bar\nwas then robust (e.g. Sellwood 1981).\nAlready, some dynamical heating was observed to produce some feedback\nin the bar strength evolution: more unstable stellar disks develop a bar sooner,\nbut then end up with a weaker bar than more stable disks (Combes et al 1990).\n1.2.\n\nBars with gas disks\n\nThe introduction of gas in disks completely changes the stability, due to dissipation. The angular momentum can be exchanged between gas and stars, and\nfrom inner to outer parts, again with a negligible halo component. While gas\nflows towards the center, the bar is destroyed and gives rise to a triaxial bulge\n(Friedli & Benz 1993).\nAll this evolution can be traced back to the bar gravity torques acting on\nthe gas. The torques are proportional to the phase shift between the gas and the\npotential wells due mainly to the stars in the bar. Dissipation produces these\nphase shifts, which are conspicuous through the characteristic leading dust lanes\n1\n\n\f2\n\nF. Combes\n\nin barred galaxies. The gas then loses angular momentum and mass concentrates\ntowards the center.\nThe amplitude of the phenomenon has been quantified from observations of\nbarred galaxies. The gravity torques can be computed from the stellar potential\ndeduced from the red image of the galaxy, and the effective angular momentum\nexchange computed from the gas distribution, obtained through H\u03b1, HI or CO\nemission images. In strongly barred galaxies, the gas inside corotation inflows\nto the center in one or two rotations. Even in weakly barred galaxies, the\ngravity torques are efficiently producing gas flows, and fueling the nucleus, as\nfor instance in NGC 6574 (Lindt-Krieg et al 2007) or NGC 3147 (Casasola et al\n2008).\n1.3.\n\nFormation of rings\n\nThe secular evolution as described above, the gas inflow driven by bars, finds its\nconfirmation in the frequent observation of resonant rings, where gas is piling\nup, and form stars in bright knots. The gravity torques change sign at each\nresonance, and cancel in the rings where the gas disctribution is symmetrically\ndistributed with respect to the stars.\nGalaxies often possess multiple-rings, corresponding to the various Lindblad\nresonances, ILR, UHR, OLR (Buta & Combes 1996). With only one bar, the\ngas stops its inflow at the ILR, in the nuclear ring. The decoupling of a nuclear\nbar inside the nuclear ring triggers the AGN fueling (cf NGC 2782, Fig 1).\n2.\n\nAngular momentum transfer with haloes\n\nWhen a massive dark halo is taken into account around spiral galaxies, the angular momentum transfer occurs mainy from baryons to the dark matter halo\n(Athanassoula 2002, 2003). This dominates over the exchange with gas, or between the inner and the outer disk. This loss of angular momentum boosts the\nbar strength. In addition, due to the bar dynamical friction against the dark\nmatter particles in the halo, the bar pattern speed decreases regularly (Debattista & Sellwood 2000). The low value obtained at the end is not compatible\nwith the high pattern speeds observed. This constrains the amount of dark\nmatter in the inner parts of the galaxy, and favors a maximum disk.\nA consequence of the angular momentum exchange, is the re-distribution\nof matter across the disk, which could be at the origin of surface density breaks,\nfrequently observed in spiral galaxies (e.g. Pohlen, 2002). For instance the outer\ndisk breaks could correspond to the outer Lindblad resonance (Debattista et al\n2006). Other mechanisms have been invoked for the existence of these breaks\n(Roskar et al 2008, Figure 2). When considering the inside-out formation of a\ndisk galaxy from a halo of gas, the break corresponds to a star formation cut-off,\ndue to a threshold in gas density, and the exponential radial distribution beyond\nthe break is due to scattering of stars by spiral arms.\nIf the bar strengthens through angular momentum transfer to the dark\nmatter halo, it is choked by the vertical resonance and peanut formation. During\nthe standard bar formation, the pattern speed \u03a9b increases first, due to mass\nconcentration, and decreases slightly after. In presence of a massive halo, the\n\n\fSecular evolution of disk galaxies\n\nFigure 1.\nGray scale plot of the stellar component (left), the gas component (middle), and an expanded version of the gas distribution (right), in a\nself-consistent simulation of a double bar formation, meant to reproduce the\ngalaxy NGC 2782 (the axes are in kpc). It can be seen that the gas, which\nwas predominantly in the more external ring, corresponding to the ILR of\nthe primary bar, at T=690 Myr, is falling progressively inward, and is found\ninside the ILR at T=750 Myr. From Hunt et al (2008).\n\n3\n\n\f4\n\nF. Combes\n\nFigure 2. Radial distributions at various epochs (1, 5, and 10 Gyr) of the\nstellar surface density, the gas surface density, the star formation rate, and\nthe mean stellar age, of a disk simulation by Roskar et al (2008). The stellar\ndensity is fitted by two exponentials, which intersection is taken as the break\nradius (materialized by the vertical lines in all panels).\n\n\fSecular evolution of disk galaxies\n\n5\n\npattern speed slows down much more, and the resonance moves outward in\nradius. There is then two successive bucklings (Martinez-Valpuesta et al 2006).\n3.\n3.1.\n\nBar destruction, formation of lenses\nMechanisms of destruction\n\nIt is known from the first self-consistent numerical simulations of disks with gas\nthat bars can be destroyed (Friedli & Benz 1993). This destruction was first\nthought to be due only to the central mass concentration (CMC), produced by\nthe gas inflow (Norman et al 1996). The chaos induced by the superposition\nof a CMC and a bar destroys bars in pure stellar disks. For pure stellar models, a CMC is more efficient to destroy bars, in disk-dominated models. The\nbar pattern speed increases when bar weakens, which is the reverse when bar\nstrengthens (Athanassoula et al 2005).\nWhen the gas fraction in a spiral galaxy is larger than 5% of the total mass,\nthen the gas inflow alone is able to destroy the bar (Bournaud & Combes 2002).\nGas is driven inwards by the bar torques. The angular momentum lost by the\ngas is taken up by the bar wave, and this destroys the bar, which is a wave\nwith negative momentum inside corotation. The main destruction mechanism is\ntherefore the torque exerted from the gas to the bar, and not only the presence of\nthe Central Mass Concentration. A CMC of only 1% is not sufficient to destroy\nthe bar (Shen & Sellwood 2004). But 1-2% of gas infall is enough to transform\na bar in a lens (Friedli 1994, Berentzen et al 1998, Bournaud et al 2005a). The\nfinal effect of gas depends on the cooling: the bar is destroyed by an isothermal\nbut not an adiabatic gas (Debattista et al 2006).\n3.2.\n\nReformation of bars\n\nFor all gas-rich intermediate and late-type spirals, the observed frequency of\nbars means that bars have to be reformed after their destruction. If external\ngas is accreted through the outer parts, the secular evolution can involve a selfregulated cycle, where the bar is destroyed by the gas inflow it has produced,\nbut can reform when the gas disk is replenished by external accretion. When the\nbar is strong, accreted gas is stalled at the OLR, since positive gravity torques\nare exerted between CR and OLR. The gas inflow is intermittent. When the\nbar weakens, the gas can replenish the disk, to make it unstable again to bar\nformation.\nIn a recent work, Berentzen et al (2007) have found on the contrary that\nthe angular momentum exchange between the gas and the stars was quite low,\nand that most of the exchange was between the stars and the dark matter halo.\nTheir gas fraction was not high (fgas < 8%), but their disks were dominated by\nthe dark halo. In spite of this, the bar is destroyed more quickly in the presence\nof gas, and the destruction efficiency is correlated with the gas fraction. Their\nmain bar destruction is through a peanut formation, however the presence of gas\nprevents peanuts. The bar destruction is attributed to the CMC. The fraction\nof gas able to destroy bars is higher in presence of massive dark matter haloes.\nWhen the DM halo mass is negligible within the disk, the gas fraction of 6% is\nsufficient. It becomes 20%, when the DM/disk mass ratio is 3 (Curir et al 2007).\n\n\f6\n\nF. Combes\n\nThe influence of the dark matter halo is well studied through the comparison\nwith galaxy models in modified gravity. Numerical simulations have been done\nwith identical disks as initial conditions, with the same rotation curve. The\nlatter is flat, in one case due to a surrounding dark matter halo, in the other\ncase due to the MOND dynamics (Tiret & Combes 2007). The bar strength and\npattern speed are quite different with and without DM.\nWith DM, the bar appears later, and can reform after the peanut-driven\nbar weakening through angular momentum exchange with the halo, but the\npattern speed \u03a9b falls off. The peanut moves outwards in radius due to the\nslowing down of the bar. With MOND, disks are more unstable, and stronger\nbars form earlier, they are also weakened by peanut formation, but later. They\ncannot reform afterwards, in the absence of halo particles to absorb the angular\nmomentum. Overall on a series of models representing the Hubble sequence,\nbars are more frequent in MOND.\n3.3.\n\nAre lenses dissolved bars ?\n\nThe suggestion has been made by Kormendy (1979) that lenses could be the\nsignal of destroyed bars. In particular, the sharp edge of lenses coincides with a\npotential resonance: inner lenses extend to what was an inner ring, outer lenses\nextend to the old outer ring. At the extremities of weak bars, are frequently\nobserved \"ansae\", or bright spots ending the oval/bar. The frequency of \"ansae\"\nis strong for early-type galaxies, and then decreases significantly towards the\nlate-types (Martinez-Valpuesta et al 2007).\nLenses are stellar components of nearly constant surface density, with a\nsharp edge, and steep outer gradient, as shown by the prototypical examples\nN1553 (Freeman 1975) or N1291 (Kormendy 1982). They are as flat as disks,\nand have the same sizes and colors than bars. Their kinematics reveal high\nvelocity dispersion in the center, and low in the outer parts. 54% of SB0-SBa\nhave lenses, but not late-type nor early-type unbarred galaxies (Kormendy 1979).\nThe bar fills the lens in one dimension, mimicking a \u0398-like morphology. There\nis therefore no doubt that lenses are associated to bars.\nNumerical simulations of bar destruction by a CMC are compatible with\nthe hypothesis of lenses being destroyed bars. The bar is weakened when chaotic\norbits dominate in the region between x2 orbits near the CMC and 4/1 orbits\nnear corotation. In the chaotic sea, orbits are bounded only inside corotation,\nwhich could explain the sharp cut-off of the lens; the remaining regular orbits\nnear CR would provide the \"ansae\" morphology. NGC 1291, a lens prototype,\nis probably experiencing a destruction phase: it has an embedded bar, as shown\nin Figure 3. It is an SB0a spiral, with blue, HI gas-rich, outer ring (OLR), with\nhot X-ray gas in the center, of low metallicity (0.1Z\u2299 ). This low-abundance gas\ncould be due to infall (Perez & Freeman 2006).\n4.\n\nLopsidedness (m=1 modes)\n\nSecular evolution involves also asymmetrical modes, such as lopsidedness. About\nhalf of all galaxies possess an asymmetry in their HI distribution (Richter & Sancisi 1994). This fraction increases to 77% for late-types (Matthews et al 1998).\nAbout 20% of galaxies have their m = 1 Fourier coefficient in stellar density\n\n\fSecular evolution of disk galaxies\n\n7\n\nFigure 3.\nVisible image of NGC 1291 (right), and an expanded version of\nthe central distribution (right), in the near-infrared.\n\nA1 >0.2, from their near-infrared images. This high degree of asymmetry could\nbe driven by a dark matter halo asymmetry (Angiras et al 2007). Some could be\ndue to companions, but it is not the general case, since the m = 1 perturbation is\nthen short-lived. Asymmetric gas accretion could provide a mechanism (Bournaud et al 2005b). Alternatively, counter-rotating disks produce lopsidedness\n(Dury et al, this conference).\nIt is also possible that global m = 1 modes develop in stellar disks, without\nany dark matter halo. These are modes of long wavelength, of the order of the\ndisk radius (Saha et al 2007, Figure 4). Their precession rate is low, and the\nself-gravitating modes have a small pattern speed.\n5.\n\nConclusion\n\nSecular evolution is important for bars, it controls their strength, their pattern\nspeed, or their vertical thickness through peanut formation. The dominant\nangular momentum transfer from the disk occurs with the DM halo or with the\nouter disk, according to the halo to disk mass ratio, or between the stellar and\ngaseous components, according to the dissipation character of the gas.\nBars are weakened by central mass concentrations and/or gas inflows, driven\nby bars themselves, implying self-regulation. The gas fraction able to destroy\nbars depends on the dark matter halo to disk mass ratio. Lopsidedness (m = 1\nglobal mode) can also weaken the bar. Bars dissolve into lenses, especially in\nearly-type galaxies.\nReferences\nAngiras, R.A., Jog, C.J., Dwarakanath, K.S., Verheijen, M.:2007 MNRAS 378, 276\nAthanassoula, E.: 2002, ApJ 569, L83\n\n\f8\n\nF.
