In particular, this model provides a good fit to both the cosmic\nmicrowave background (CMB) [1] and large scale structure (LSS) data (although in this last case one additional\nparameter, the bias parameter b, is needed) [2]. Nevertheless, the data leave room for more refined models,\ndescribed by additional parameters: among them, the\nspatial curvature, the amplitude of tensor fluctuations, a\nrunning spectral index for scalar modes, the equation of\nstate for dark energy, the neutrino fraction in the dark\nmatter component, a non-standard value for the relativistic energy density. All have been considered in previous\nworks. In particular the last two have been studied in order to gain deeper information on the properties of neutrinos [1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17].\nBefore the measurements of the CMB anisotropy spectrum carried out by the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy\nProbe (WMAP) [1, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23], the combined CMB and LSS data yielded thePfollowing upper\nbound on the sum of neutrino masses:\nm\u03bd \u2264 3 eV [3].\n\u2217 Electronic\n\naddress: lattanzi@icra.it\n\nThe WMAP precision data allowed to strengthen this\nlimit. Using rather simplifying assumptions, i.e., assuming three thermalized neutrino families all with the same\nmass and a null chemical potential (thus implying perfect\nlepton symmetry), the WMAP team found that the neutrino mass should be lower than 0.23\nP eV [1]. This tight\nlimit has been somewhat relaxed to m\u03bd \u2264 1 eV [4] owing to a more careful treatment of the Ly-\u03b1 data, and its\ndependence on the priors has been examined [5]. The LSS\ndata can also be used to put similar constraints, although\nthey are usually weaker. Using the data from the 2 Degree Field Galaxy Redshift Survey (2dFGRS) and assuming \"concordance\" values for the matter P\ndensity \u03a9m and\nthe Hubble constant h it is found that\nm\u03bd \u2264 1.8 eV\n[6]. A combined analysis of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey\nP (SDSS) and WMAP data gives a similar bound :\nm\u03bd \u2264 1.7 eV [2]. Quite interestingly, the authors of\nRef. [2] claim that, from a conservative point of view (i.e.,\nmaking as few assumptions as possible), the WMAP data\nalone don't give any information about the neutrino mass\nand are indeed consistent with neutrinos making up the\n100% of dark matter. In Ref. [7] it is claimed that the\ncosmological data favor a non-zero neutrino mass at the\n68% confidence\nlimit, while the authors of Ref. [8] find\nP\nthe limit\nm\u03bd < 0.74.\n\nAt the same time, more detailed scenarios with a different structure of the neutrino sector have been studied. The first and more natural extension to the standard scenario is the one in which a certain degree of\nlepton asymmetry (parameterized by the so-called degeneracy parameter \u03be, i.e., the dimensionless chemical\npotential) is introduced [24, 25, 26]. Although standard models of baryogenesis (for example those based\non SU (5) grand unification models) predict the lepton\n\n\f2\ncharge asymmetry to be of the same order of the baryonic\nasymmetry B \u223c 10\u221210 , nevertheless there are many particle physics motivated scenario in which a lepton asymmetry much larger than the baryionic one is generated\n[27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39]. In some\ncases, the predicted lepton asymmetry can be of order\nunity. One of the interesting cosmological implications\nof a net leptonic asymmetry is the possibility to generate small observed baryonic asymmetry of the Universe\n[40, 41] via the so-called sphaleron process [42]. The process of Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) is very sensitive\nto a lepton asymmetry in the electronic sector, since an\nexcess (deficit) of electron neutrinos with respect to their\nantiparticles, alters the equilibrium of beta reactions and\nleads to a lower (higher) cosmological neutron to proton\nratio n/p. On the other hand, an asymmetry in the \u03bc\nor \u03c4 sector, even if not influencing directly the beta reactions, can increase the equilibrium n/p ratio due to a\nfaster cosmological expansion. This can be used to constrain the value of the degeneracy parameter [43]. This\nleads to the bounds \u22120.01 < \u03bee < 0.22 and |\u03be\u03bc,\u03c4 | < 2.6\n[44, 45].\nThe effect of a relic neutrino asymmetry on the CMB\nanisotropy and matter power spectrum was first studied\nin Ref. [46], and is mainly related to the fact that a lepton asymmetry implies an energy density in relativistic\nparticles larger than in the standard case. The cosmological observables can then be used to constrain this extra\nenergy density, parameterized by the effective number of\nrelativistic neutrino species N eff . Although this is somewhat more general than the case of a lepton asymmetry,\nin the sense that the extra energy density can arise due to\nother effects as well, nevertheless the case of a non-null\nchemical potential is not strictly covered by the introduction of N eff . This is because the increased relativistic\nenergy density is not the only effect connected to the lepton asymmetry (an additional side effect is for example\na change in the Jeans mass of neutrinos [24, 26, 47]). In\nthe hypothesis of a negligible neutrino mass, it has been\nshown that the WMAP data constrain N eff to be smaller\nthan 9; when other CMB and LSS data are taken into\naccount, the bound shrinks to 1.4 \u2264 N eff \u2264 6.8 [9, 10]. A\ncombined analysis of CMB and BBN data leads to even\ntighter bounds [4, 11, 12, 13]. A more detailed analysis, in which the effective number of relativistic relics\nand the neutrino mass are both left arbitrary and varied\nindependently, can be found in Ref. [14]. In the same\npaper, the effect of different mass splittings is also studied. Finally an extension of these arguments to the case\nin which additional relativistic, low-mass relics (such as\na fourth, sterile neutrino or a QCD axion) are present,\nhas been studied in Ref. [15].\nThe goal of this paper is to perform an analysis of the\nWMAP data using the degeneracy parameter, together\nwith the effective number of relativistic particles, as additional free parameters, in order to put constraints on the\nlepton number of the Universe. We work in the framework of an extended cosmological model with three ther-\n\nmally distributed neutrino families having all the same\nmass and chemical potential, plus a certain amount of\nexotic particles species, considered to be effectively massless. We use the physical neutrino density \u03c9\u03bd \u2261 \u03a9\u03bd h2 ,\nthe degeneracy parameter \u03be and the extra energy deneff\nsity in exotic particles \u2206Nothers\nas additional parameters\nthat describe the neutrino sector. We perform an analysis in a 8-dimensional parameter space that includes the\nstandard, \"core\" cosmological parameters.\nThe paper is organized as follows. After a discussion on\nthe motivations that drive our work in Sec. II, we shortly\nreview some basic formulae in Sec. III and discuss the\nimpact of a non-null degeneracy parameter on the CMB\nspectrum in Sec. IV. In Sec. V we describe the analysis\npipeline, while in Sec. VI we present our basic results.\nFinally, we draw our conclusions in Sec. VII.\n\nII.\n\nMOTIVATION FOR THIS WORK\n\nThe main motivation for this work comes from the fact\nthat, even though several analyses have been performed\nwhich were aimed at putting constraints on the number\nof effective relativistic degrees of freedom, a statistical\nanalysis of the CMB data aiming to put bounds directly\non the degeneracy parameter, instead of on N eff , is nevertheless still missing. There are two reasons for this:\nfirst of all, in the limit of a vanishing neutrino mass, the\nincrease in N eff is in effect all that is needed to implement the non null chemical potential into the standard\nmodel of the evolution of perturbations [46, 48]. It is\nthen argued that, since neutrinos with mass smaller than\nroughly 0.3 eV, being still relativistic at the time of last\nscattering, would behave as massless, the distinction between \u03be and N eff is no more relevant in this case for what\nconcerns their effect on the CMB anisotropy spectrum.\nAlthough this is certainly true, it is our opinion that this\ndoes not allow to neglect a priori the difference between\nthe two parameters. One reason is that the most conservative bound on neutrino mass, coming from the tritium\nbeta decay experiments, reads m\u03bd < 2.2 eV (at the 2\u03c3\nlevel) [49, 50], that is quite higher than the value of 0.3 eV\nquoted above. The main evidences for a neutrino mass\nin the sub-eV range come, in the field of particle physics,\nfrom the experiments on neutrinoless double beta decay\n[51, 52], whose interpretation depends on assumptions\nabout the Majorana nature of neutrinos and on the details of the mixing matrix. Other indications of a sub-eV\nmass come, as stated above, from cosmology and in particular from the power spectrum of anisotropies, but since\nwe want to keep our results as much as possible independent from other analyses, we should not use information\non neutrino mass derived from the previous analyses of\nthe CMB data. Moreover, let us note that CMB data\nanalyses are often refined using the results from LSS experiments. Since the structure formation, starting close\nto the epoch of matter-radiation equality, goes on until\nvery late times, even very light neutrinos (in the range\n\n\f3\n10\u22123 \u00f70.3 eV) cannot be considered massless for the purpose of evaluating their effect on the matter power spectrum. This means in particular that using N eff would\nlead to overlook the change in the free streaming length\nand in the Jeans mass of neutrinos due to the increased\nvelocity dispersion [53]. It is then our opinion that the\nuse of N eff , even if correct with respect to the interpretation of CMB data, precludes the possibility of correctly\nimplementing the LSS data as a subsequent step in the\nanalysis pipeline.\nThe second point against the cosmological significance\nof the degeneracy parameter is related to the constrain\nfrom BBN. It was recently shown that, if the Large Mixing Angle (LMA) solution to the solar neutrino problem\nis correct (as the results of the KamLAND experiment\nsuggest [54]), then the flavor neutrino oscillations equalize the chemical potentials of e, \u03bc and \u03c4 neutrinos prior\nto the onset of BBN, so that a stringent limit \u03be . 0.07\nactually applies to all flavours [55, 56, 57]. This would\nconstrain the lepton asymmetry of the Universe to such\nsmall values that it could be safely ignored in cosmological analyses. However, the presence of another relativistic particle or scalar field would make these limits\nrelax [58], while the effect of the mixing with a light sterile neutrino, whose existence is required in order to account for the results of the Liquid Scintillation Neutrino\nDetector (LSND) experiment [59], is still unclear [56].\nMoreover, it has been recently shown that a hypothetical\nneutrino-majoron coupling can suppress neutrino flavor\noscillations, thus reopening a window for a large lepton\nasymmetry [60, 61]. For all these reasons, we judge it is\ninteresting to study if CMB data alone can constraint or\nmaybe even rule out such exotic scenarios.\n\nIII.\n\nBASIC FORMULAE\n\nIt is customary in cosmology to call ultrarelativistic (or\nsimply relativistic) a species x that decouples from the\nphoton bath at a temperature Td such that its thermal\nenergy is much larger than its rest mass energy: kB Td \u226b\nmx c2 .\nOwing to Liouville's theorem, the distribution function in momentum space fx (p ; Tx , \u03bex ) of the species x is\ngiven, after decoupling, by (we shall use all throughout\nthe paper units in which c = ~ = kB = 1):\n\u0013\n\u0015\u22121\n\u0014\n\u0012\np\ngx\nexp\n,\n\u2212 \u03bex \u00b1 1\nfx (p ; Tx , \u03bex ) =\n(2\u03c0)3\nTx\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03be \u2261 \u03bcd /Td is the dimensionless chemical potential,\noften called degeneracy parameter, the sign + (\u2212) corresponds to the case in which the x's are fermions (bosons),\ng is the number of quantum degrees of freedom, and the\ntemperature T evolves in time as the inverse of the cosmological scale factor a, so that T (t) * a(t) = const.\nThe energy density of the x's at a given temperature\n\nis readily calculated:\nZ\n\n\u03c1x (Tx , \u03be) =\n\nE(p) f (p ; Tx , \u03bex )d3 p~ =\n\ngx\n2\u03c0 2\n\n=\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\np2\n\n0\n\np\np2 + m2x f (p ; Tx , \u03bex )dp.

However, the\ntemperature dependence disappear from the integral in\ntwo notable limits, the ultrarelativistic (UR) and nonrelativistic (NR) one, corresponding respectively to the\ntwo opposite cases \u03b2 \u226a 1 and \u03b2 \u226b 1 [25].

In chemical equilibrium, the relation \u03bex = \u2212\u03bex\u0304 holds\nowing to the conservation of chemical potential, as can\nbe seen considering the reaction:\nx + x\u0304 \u2190\u2192 . . . \u2190\u2192 \u03b3 + \u03b3\n\n(8)\n\n\f4\nand noting that the chemical potential in the final state\nvanishes [62]. This relation holds for neutrinos and antineutrinos in several cosmological scenarios. There are\nsome exceptions to this, most notably early Universe scenarios in which lepton asymmetry is generated [63] or destroyed [64] by active-sterile neutrino oscillations at low\ntemperatures. However, we shall assume all throughout\nthe paper that the relation \u03be\u03bd = \u2212\u03be\u03bd\u0304 holds.\nIt can then be shown that\neff\ngx+x\u0304\n= gxeff + gx\u0304eff =\n\"\n\u0012 \u00132\n\u0012 \u00134 # \u0012 0 \u00134\n7\n30 \u03bex\n15 \u03bex\nTx\n= gx 1 +\n+\n, (9)\n8\n7\n\u03c0\n7\n\u03c0\nT\u03b30\n\nwhere the factor between square parentheses can be recognized as what it is often quoted as the contribution of a\nnon-vanishing chemical potential to the effective number\nof relativistic species N eff .\nThe definitions introduced above can be easily extended to the case when several ultra-relativistic species\nxi are present:\ng eff \u2261\n\nX\n\ngieff ,\n\n(10)\n\ni\n\nwhere photons are excluded from the summation. This\nmeans that, since g\u03b3eff = g\u03b3 = 1, the actual number of\nrelativistic degrees of freedom is (1 + g eff ).\nThe total density of ultrarelativistic particles at a given\ntime is thus:\n\u03c1rad =\n\n\u03c10\u03b3\n\n1+g\n\neff\n\n\u0001\n\n4\n\n(1 + z) .\n\n(11)\n\nFinally we can use this expression to find the dependence on g eff of the redshift of radiation-matter equality\nzeq (the subscripts b and CDM stands for baryons and\ncold dark matter respectively):\n\n1 + zeq =\n\n\u0001\u22121\n\u03c10b + \u03c10CDM\n1 + g eff\n.\n\u03c10\u03b3\n\n(12)\n\nSo, the larger is the energy density of ultra-relativistic\nparticles in the Universe, parameterized by the effective\nnumber of degrees of freedom g eff , the smaller zeq will be,\ni.e., the later the equality between radiation and matter\nwill occur. In other words, supposing that the density in\nnon-relativistic particles (baryons + CDM) is well known\nand fixed, having more relativistic degrees of freedom will\nshift zeq closer to us and to the CMB decoupling.\nIn the standard cosmological scenario, the only contribution to the energy density of relativistic particles other\nthan photons is the one due to the three families of standard neutrinos, with zero chemical potential. The ratio\nof the neutrino temperature to the photon temperature\nis T\u03bd0 /T\u03b30 = (4/11)1/3 , due to the entropy transfer that\n\nfollowed the electron-positron annihilation, shortly after\nneutrino decoupling. Then\n\ng\n\neff\n\n7\n=\n8\n\n\u0012\n\n4\n11\n\n\u00134/3\n\nN\u03bd \u2243 0.23 N\u03bd ,\n\n(13)\n\nwhere N\u03bd = 3 is the number of neutrino families. The\nenergy density in a single neutrino species is:\n\n\u03c1std\n\u03bd =\n\n7\u03c0 2\n120\n\n\u0012\n\n4\n11\n\n\u00134/3\n\nT\u03b34 .\n\n(14)\n\nHowever, several mechanisms that could increase (or\neven decrease) the energy density of relativistic particles have been proposed. In the presence of some extra\nrelics (such as sterile neutrinos, majorons, axions, etc.)\nthe energy density of radiation would obviously increase.\nA non-zero chemical potential for neutrinos or an unaccounted change of \u03c1\u03b3 , due for example to particle decays\nthat increase the photon temperature, would produce the\nsame result. In all cases the effect is the same: a change\nin g eff , as it can be seen by looking at eq. (7). It is usual\nin the literature to parameterize the extra energy density\nby introducing an effective number of neutrino families\nN eff , defined as:\n\nN\n\neff\n\n\u2261\n\nP\n\ni \u03c1i\n,\nstd\n\u03c1\u03bd\n\n(15)\n\nwhere again the sum runs over all ultrarelativistic\nspecies with the exceptions of photons. It is clear from\nthis definition that N eff is actually the energy density in\nultrarelativistic species (apart from photons) normalized\nto the energy density of a single neutrino species with\nzero chemical potential and standard thermal history. It\nis easy to show that a relation formally similar to (13)\nholds in the non-standard scenario:\ng eff = 0.23 N eff .\n\n(16)\n\nIn addition, it should be noted that even in the standard scenario N eff 6= N\u03bd = 3, but instead N eff \u2243 3.04.\nThis is due to the fact that neutrino decoupling is not instantaneous, so that neutrino actually share some of the\nentropy transfer of the e+ e\u2212 annihilation, on one side,\nand to finite temperature quantum electrodynamics corrections on the other [65, 66].\nIt is also useful to introduce the effective number of\nadditional relativistic species \u2206N eff defined as:\n\u2206N eff \u2261 N eff \u2212 3.04 ,\n\n(17)\n\nso that \u2206N eff = 0 in the standard scenario. Please note\nthat \u2206N eff can also be negative, for example in very low\nreheating scenarios [67].\n\n\f5\nIn this paper we shall consider a scenario in which the\nradiation content of the Universe at the time of radiationmatter equality is shared among photons, three neutrino\nfamilies with standard temperature but possibly nonzero chemical potential, and some other relic particle.\nWe shall suppose that the presence of the latter can be\ncompletely taken into account through its effect on N eff .\nThis is true if the species has been in its ultrarelativistic\nregime for the most part of the history of the Universe.\nThe presence of this extra relic is required for our analysis, in order to circumvent the equalization of neutrino\nchemical potentials, as explained at the end of section II.\nWe also assume that the degeneracy parameters for neutrinos and antineutrinos are equal and opposite, and that\ne, \u03bc and \u03c4 neutrinos all have the same chemical potential.\nThe extra energy density can thus be split into two\ndistinct contributions, the first due to the non-zero degeneracy parameter of neutrinos and the second due to\nthe extra relic(s):\neff\n\u2206N eff = \u2206N\u03bdeff (\u03be) + \u2206Nothers\n.\n\n(18)\n\nFollowing our assumptions, \u2206N\u03bdeff can be expressed as a\nfunction of the chemical potential only:\n\" \u0012 \u0013\n\u0012 \u00134 #\n2\n30 \u03bex\n15 \u03bex\neff\n\u2206N\u03bd (\u03be) = 3\n.\n(19)\n+\n7\n\u03c0\n7\n\u03c0\nIV.\n\nEFFECT OF A NON-NULL CHEMICAL\nPOTENTIAL\n\nAs anticipated above, the main effect connected to the\npresence of a non-vanishing degeneracy parameter, is an\nincrease in g eff (or, equivalently, in N eff ). The presence of\nthis extra number of effective relativistic degrees of freedom can in principle be detected from observations of\nthe CMB radiation. The shift of matter-radiation equality has important consequences for the CMB anisotropy\nspectrum, these being due to the larger amplitude of the\noscillations that enter the horizon during the radiation\ndominated phase, and to a larger early integrated SachsWolfe (ISW) effect. However these effects, basically due\nto the speeding up of the cosmological expansion, can be\nsimilarly produced by the variation of other cosmological\nparameters, for example by a smaller CDM density.\nMoreover since the change in the redshift of matterradiation equality depends on the ultra-relativistic\nspecies only through the quantity g eff , it cannot be used\nto distinguish between the different species (i.e., it is \"flavor blind\"), nor to understand if the excess energy density is due to the presence of some unconventional relic,\nto an extra entropy transfer to photons, or to a nonnull chemical potential (i.e., to a lepton asymmetry), or\nmaybe to all of the previous.\nHowever ultrarelativistic particles, other than changing the background evolution, have an effect even on the\nevolution of perturbations, as it was pointed out in [68]\n\nwith particular regard to the case of neutrinos. First of\nall, the high velocity dispersion of ultrarelativistic particles damps all perturbations under the horizon scale.\nSecond, the anisotropic part of the neutrino stress-energy\ntensor couples with the tensor part of the metric perturbations. It was shown in [69] that this reduces the\namplitude squared of tensor modes by roughly 30% at\nsmall scales. Finally, the authors of Ref. [68] claimed\nthat the perturbations of relativistic neutrinos produce a\ndistinctive phase shift of the CMB acoustic oscillations.\nThese effects can thus be used to break the degeneracy\nbetween g eff and other parameters. It remains to establish whether they can be used to break the degeneracy\nbetween the different contributions to g eff or not. Even\nwithout performing a detailed analysis, it can be seen by\nlooking at the relevant equations in Ref. [68] and [69],\nthat both the absorption of tensor modes and the phase\nshift depend on the quantity f\u03bd \u2261 \u03c1\u03bd /(\u03c1\u03b3 + \u03c1\u03bd ). The\neffect of free streaming, even if more difficult to express\nanalytically, is also mainly dependent on the value of f\u03bd\n[70]. If we consider the case where the three standard\nneutrinos are the only contribution to the radiation energy density other than photons, but we allow for the\npossibility of a non-vanishing chemical potential or for a\ndifferent T\u03bd0 /T\u03b30 ratio, we see again that the changes in\nthe shape of the CMB anisotropy spectrum depend only\non g eff as whole, as long as eq. (6) retains its validity, i.e.,\nas long as neutrinos are in their ultra-relativistic regime.\nEven considering the presence of some additional relic\nparticle x does not seem to change this picture. Supposing that the other ultrarelativistic particles behave as\nneutrinos for what concerns the effects under consideration, we can argue that in all cases the relevant quantity\nis fx \u2261 \u03c1x /\u03c1rad , so that we are again lead to the conclusions that g eff is the only relevant parameter. This\nmeans, for example, that in the case of neutrinos with\nmass less than \u223c 0.3 eV, so that they stay ultrarelativistic until the time of last scattering and for some time after, the effect on CMB perturbations is exactly the same\nof massless neutrinos, and every change in their temperature or chemical potential, as even the presence of an\nadditional, sterile neutrino, is absorbed in g eff (moreover,\nwe don't have obviously any possibility to extract information about their mass).\nHowever the picture changes when considering neutrinos (or other relic particles) that go out from the ultrarelativistic regime before matter-radiation decoupling. If\nthe neutrino mass is larger than \u223c 0.3 eV, the effect of\nits finite mass is felt by the perturbations that enter the\nhorizon after neutrinos have gone out from the ultrarelativistic regime, because from some point on the evolution\nthe energy density will be given no more by the approximate formula (6), but instead by eq. (2) that contains\na dependence on mass through the term \u03b2. A side effect\nof this is that it will not be possible to single out the dependence of \u03c1 from T and \u03be as an overall factor, so that\nthese two contributions become distinguishable.\nLet us make this more clear with an example. Consider\n\n\f6\na gravitational wave entering the horizon after neutrinos\nbecame non-relativistic, but before matter-radiation decoupling. This wave will be absorbed, according to [69],\nproportionally to \u03c1\u03bd . On the other hand the free streaming length of neutrinos will vary according to the velocity\ndispersion < v 2 > [24, 47]. The key point is that, for a\ngas of non-relativistic particles, \u03c1\u03bd and < v 2 > will depend on T\u03bd and \u03be\u03bd in different ways, so that measuring\nindependently the absorption factor and the free streaming length, it would be possible at least in principle to\nobtain the values of T\u03bd and \u03be\u03bd without any ambiguity\nleft.\nWhat we have just said is even more true with respect\nto the LSS data, since even neutrinos with mass greater\nthan 10\u22123 eV are in their non-relativistic regime during\nthe late stages of the process of structure formation. We\nconclude then by stressing that one should be careful\nwhen parameterizing the lepton asymmetry by means of\nan effective number of degrees of freedom.\n\nV.\n\nMETHOD\n\nWe used the CMBFAST code [71], modified as described\nin Ref. [46] in order to account for a non vanishing\nchemical potential of neutrinos, to compute the temperature (TT) and polarization (TE) CMB spectra for different combinations of the cosmological parameters. As\na first step, we added three more parameters, namely\nthe effective number of additional relativistic species\neff\n, the neutrino degeneracy parameter \u03be (both de\u2206Nothers\nfined in Sec. III) and the neutrino physical energy density\n\u03c9\u03bd \u2261 \u03a9\u03bd h2 to the standard six-parameters \u039bCDM model\nthat accounts in a remarkably good way for the WMAP\neff\naccounts only for\ndata. As anticipated above, \u2206Nothers\nthe extra energy density due to the presence of additional\nrelic relativistic particles other than the three Standard\neff\nModel neutrinos. We shall refer to the (\u03c9\u03bd , \u03be, \u2206Nothers\n)\nsubspace as the \"neutrino sector\" of the parameter space\neff\n(although, as we have just noticed, \u2206Nothers\ndoes not\nrefer directly to neutrinos).\nWith the above mentioned choice of the parameters we\ncan make a consistency check to our results, by verifying\neff\nthat imposing the priors \u03be = 0, \u03c9\u03bd = 0 and \u2206Nothers\n= 0,\nwe obtain results that are in agreement with the ones of\nthe WMAP collaboration. Moreover, by choosing a sufficiently wide range for the variation of the three additional\nparameters, we can check how much their introduction\naffects the estimation of the best-fit values of the core\nparameters. Thus we choose to use the following parameters: the physical baryon density \u03c9b \u2261 \u03a9b h2 , the total\ndensity of non relativistic matter \u03c9m \u2261 (\u03a9b + \u03a9CDM )h2 ,\nthe scalar spectral index n, the optical depth to reionization \u03c4 , the overall normalization of the CMB spectrum\nA, the physical neutrino density \u03c9\u03bd = \u03a9\u03bd h2 , the neutrino\ndegeneracy parameter \u03be and the extra energy density in\neff\nnon-standard relics \u2206Nothers\n. We will be considering the\nscenario in which the three standard model neutrinos\n\nhave all the same mass and chemical potential. We take\nthe chemical potential to be positive (this corresponds to\nan excess of neutrinos over antineutrinos), but since the\neffects on the CMB do not depend on the sign of \u03be, we\nquote the limits that we obtain in terms of its absolute\nvalue. We do not include as a free parameter the Hubble\nconstant H0 , whose degeneracy with the effective number\nof relativistic degrees of freedom and with the neutrino\nmass has been studied in previous works [5]. Instead we\ndecided, according to the recent measurements of Hubble\nSpace Telescope (HST) Key Project [72], to assume that\nh = 0.72. Moreover, we restrict ourselves to the case of\na flat Universe, so that the density parameter of the cosmological constant \u03a9\u039b is equal to 1 \u2212 (\u03c9m + \u03c9\u03bd )/h2 . We\nare thus dealing with a 8-dimensional parameter space.\nLet us discuss in a bit more detail the way we deal with\npriors in the neutrino sector of parameter space, i.e., with\ninformation coming from other observations, and in particular from BBN. As we have stressed in section II, the\nstandard BBN scenario, together with the equalization of\nchemical potentials, constraints the neutrino degeneracy\nparameter to values lower than the ones considered in this\npaper; on the other hand this conclusion possibly does\nnot hold in non-standard scenarios where additional relativistic relics are present. However, even non-standard\nscenarios of this kind usually single out some preferred\nregion in parameter space. At the present, several nonstandard scenarios that can account for the observed Helium abundance exist (see for example Refs. [11] and [12])\nso that we adopt a conservative approach, and choose not\nto impose any prior on the neutrino sector, other than\nthe ones that emerge \"naturally\" as a consequence of our\nchoice of parameters. Anyway, this does not preclude the\npossibility of successively using the BBN information: in\nfact once the likelihood function in the neutrino sector\nhas been calculated, it can be convolved with the relevant priors coming from non-standard BBN scenarios.\nWe span the following region in parameter space:\n0.020 \u2264 \u03c9b \u2264 0.028, 0.10 \u2264 \u03c9m \u2264 0.18, 0.9 \u2264 n \u2264 1.10,\n0 \u2264 \u03c4 \u2264 0.3, 0.70 \u2264 A \u2264 1.10, 0 \u2264 \u03c9\u03bd \u2264 0.30,\neff\n0 \u2264 |\u03be| \u2264 2.0, 0 \u2264 \u2206Nothers\n\u2264 2.0. We shall call this our\n\"(5+3) parameter space\". In order to obtain the likelieff\nhood function L(\u03c9b , \u03c9m , n, \u03c4, A, \u03c9\u03bd , \u03be, \u2206Nothers\n) in this\nregion, we sample it over a grid consisting of 5 equally\nspaced points in each dimension. For each point on our\ngrid, corresponding to a combination of the parameters,\nwe compute the likelihood relative to the TT [19] and TE\n[20] angular power spectrum observed by WMAP, using\nthe software developed by the WMAP collaboration [23]\nand kindly made publicly available at their website1 . To\nobtain the likelihood function for a single parameter, we\nshould marginalize over the remaining ones. However for\nsimplicity we approximate the multi-dimensional integration required for the marginalization procedure with a\n\n1\n\nhttp://lambda.gsfc.nasa.gov/\n\n\f7\nmaximization of the likelihood, as it is a common usage\nin this kind of likelihood analysis. This approximation\nrelies on the fact that the likelihood for cosmological parameters is supposed to have a gaussian shape (at least\nin the vicinity of its maximum) and that integration and\nmaximization are known to be equivalent for a multivariate Gaussian distribution.\n\nAccording to Bayes' theorem, in order to interpret the\nlikelihood functions as probability densities, they to be\ninverted through a convolution with the relevant priors,\nrepresenting our knowledge and assumptions on the parameters we want to constrain. Here we shall assume\nuniform priors, i.e. we will assume that all values of the\nparameters are equally probable.\n\nFor each of the core parameters, we quote the maximum likelihood value (which we shall refer to also as\nthe \"best-fit\" value) over the grid and the expectation\nvalue over the marginalized distribution function. We\nquote also the best chi square value \u03c720 (we recall that\n\u03c72 \u2261 \u22122 ln L) divided by the number of degrees freedom,\nthat is equal to the number of data (for WMAP, this is\n1348) minus the number of parameters. For what concerns the parameters of the neutrino sector, we quote the\nmaximum likelihood and the expectation value as well,\nand in addition we report a 2\u03c3 confidence interval. Using a Bayesian approach, we define the 95% confidence\nlimits as the values at which the marginalized likelihood\nis equal to exp[\u2212(\u03c720 \u2212 4)/2], i.e., the values at which\nthe likelihood is reduced by a factor exp(2) with respect\nto its maximum value 2 . There is one exception to this\nprocedure, namely, when the maximum likelihood value\nfor a parameter that is positively defined (such as \u03c9\u03bd\nor the absolute value of \u03be), let us call it \u03b8, is equal to\nzero. In this case, instead than computing the expectation value, we just give an upper bound. In order to\ndo this,\u0010we compute\ndistribution function\n\u0011 theR cumulative\nR\u03b8\n\u0001\n\u221e\nC(\u03b8) = 0 L(\u03b8\u0304)d\u03b8\u0304 / 0 L(\u03b8\u0304)d\u03b8\u0304 and quote as the upper limit at the 95% confidence level the value of \u03b8 at\nwhich C(\u03b8) = 0.95.\n\nOnce we have obtained constraints on \u03c9\u03bd , \u03be and\neff\n\u2206Nothers\n, we translate them to limits on the neutrino\nmass m\u03bd , the lepton asymmetry L and the extra number\nof effective relativistic species \u2206N eff , using eqs.

First of\nall, we check that imposing the priors \u03be = 0, \u03c9\u03bd = 0 and\neff\n\u2206Nothers\n= 0 our results are in good agreement with the\nones of the WMAP collaboration (we should refer to the\nvalues quoted in Table I of Ref. [1]). The mean and maximum likelihood values that we obtain for each parameter\nare summarized in the second and third column of Table\nI. We see that in all cases our results lie within the 68%\nconfidence interval of WMAP expected values. Then we\nremove the prior on \u03c9\u03bd , while still retaining the ones on\neff\n\u03be and \u2206Nothers\n. The maximum likelihood model has still\n\u03c9\u03bd = 0. The best-fit values of the core parameters are\nleft unchanged, and the same happens for the best-fit \u03c72 ,\nthus suggesting that a non-zero \u03c9\u03bd is not required in order to improve the goodness of fit. The results for the\ncore parameters are summarized in the fourth and fifth\ncolumn of Table I.\n\nFinally, we compute the likelihood over our whole\nparameter space. The results for the core parameters are summarized in the sixth and seventh column of Table I.\nThe maximum likelihood model\neff\n) =\nover the grid has (\u03c9b , \u03c9m , n, \u03c4, A, \u03c9\u03bd , \u03be, \u2206Nothers\n(0.022, 0.14, 0.95, 0.075, 0.7, 0, 0.5, 0). We see that this\ntime, the best fit values for the five core parameters\nare slightly changed with respect to the standard case.\nThe changes in \u03c9m and n could seem strange at a first\nsight, since intuitively one would expect the opposite behaviour, i.e., a change to larger values for both, because a\n\n\f8\nTABLE I: Core Parameters\n\nParameter\nBaryon density,\u03c9b\nMatter density,\u03c9m\nHubble constanta ,h\nSpectral index,n\nOptical depth,\u03c4\nAmplitude,A\n\u03c72 /\u03bd\na The\n\neff\nPriors: \u03be = 0, \u03a9\u03bd = 0, \u2206Nothers\n=0\nMaximum\nMean\nLikelihood\n\n0.024\n0.15\n0.72\n1.00\n0.13\n0.8\n\neff\nPriors: \u03be = 0, \u2206Nothers\n=0\nMaximum\nMean\nLikelihood\n\n0.024\n0.16\n0.72\n1.00\n0.075\n0.8\n1437/1343\n\n0.024\n0.15\n0.72\n1.00\n0.13\n0.8\n\n0.023\n0.14\n0.72\n0.98\n0.12\n0.8\n\n0.022\n0.14\n0.72\n0.95\n0.075\n0.7\n1431/1340\n\nvalue of the Hubble constant is kept fixed to h = 0.72.\n\n6000\n\n5000\n\nl(l+1)Cl / 2\u03c0 (\u03bcK)2\n\n0.024\n0.16\n0.72\n1.00\n0.075\n0.8\n1437/1342\n\nNo Neutrino Priors\nMaximum\nMean\nLikelihood\n\n4000\n\n3000\n\n2000\n\n1000\n\n0\n1\n\n10\n\n100\n\n1000\n\nMultipole Moment l\n\nFIG. 1: Comparison between the best-fit power spectrum obeff\ntained assuming the priors \u03be = 0, \u2206Nothers\n= 0 (solid line) and\nwithout such prior (dashed line). The points are the WMAP\ndata on the temperature angular power spectrum [19].\n\nlarger \u03c9m could keep the time of matter-radiation equality, while a larger n would increase the power on small\nscales thus leaving more room for neutrino free streaming. This is because the goodness of fit of a particular\nmodel with respect of the WMAP data is mainly determined by its ability to fit the first and second peak. Ineff\ncreasing together \u03c9m , n, \u03be and \u2206Nothers\nwould increase\nthe height of the first peak that can be then lowered\nback by decreasing the overall amplitude A. We show in\nfig. 1 a comparison between the best-fit spectrum in the\neff\n(\u03be = 0, \u2206Nothers\n= 0) subspace with the best-fit spectrum on the whole space.\nNow let us turn our attention to the neutrino sector of parameter space. The best-fit model over the\neff\n(\u03be = 0, \u2206Nothers\n= 0) subspace of the grid has \u03c9\u03bd = 0,\n2\nand the \u03c7 changes from 1437 to 1541 when going from\n\u03c9\u03bd = 0 to the next value in our grid, \u03c9\u03bd = 0.075. We\ncan compute an upper bound for \u03c9\u03bd , but since the region\nin which L(\u03c9\u03bd ) significantly differs from zero is all comprised between the first two values in our grid {0, 0.075},\nthe result is rather dependent from the particular interpolation scheme we choose. Using a simple, first order\ninterpolation scheme, we find the bound \u03c9\u03bd < 0.0045\n\n(95% CL), corresponding to m\u03bd < 0.14 eV, while using\nhigher order interpolation schemes the bound weakens up\nto \u03c9\u03bd < 0.015 (m\u03bd < 0.47 eV). This result should then\nbe taken with caution and we shall simply consider it as\nan indication that, although we are using a grid-based\nmethod with a rather wide grid spacing instead than the\nmore sophisticated Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)\nmethod [73, 74, 75], we basically obtain the same results\nof the WMAP collaboration, namely, \u03c9\u03bd \u2264 0.0072 [1],\neff\nwhen imposing the priors \u03be = 0, \u2206Nothers\n= 0.\nWe make a second check by imposing that \u03c9\u03bd = 0, \u03be =\neff\n0 and computing the 95% confidence region for \u2206Nothers\n.\neff\nWe find that 0 \u2264 \u2206Nothers\n\u2264 1.4. Since the degeneracy\nparameter is vanishing, the same limit applies to \u2206N eff =\neff\n\u2206Nothers\n. This is quite in agreement with the results\nquoted in Ref. [9], although it is more restrictive. This is\nprobably due to the fact that we are imposing a stronger\nprior on h, keeping it constant and equal to 0.72. This is\nconfirmed by a visual inspection of fig. 2 of Ref. [9].\nThe best-fit value for neutrino density over the whole\nparameter space is still \u03c9\u03bd = 0, but this time \u03c72 changes\nfrom 1431 to 1441 as \u03c9\u03bd goes from 0 to 0.075, so that\nthe probability density spreads out to higher values of\n\u03c9\u03bd with respect to the preceding case. The result is\nthat the upper bound raises up to \u03c9\u03bd < 0.044, quite independently from the interpolation scheme used. This\nis probably related to the already observed trend for\nwhich, when the energy density of relativistic relics is\nincreased, the possibility for larger neutrino masses reopens [4, 5, 15, 76].\nThe maximum likelihood value for the degeneracy parameter is |\u03be| = 0.5, while the expectation value over\nthe distribution function is |\u03be| = 0.56 (corresponding to\n|L| = 0.43). At the 2\u03c3 level, the degeneracy parameter is\nconstrained in the range 0 \u2264 |\u03be| \u2264 1.07. This corresponds\nto 0 \u2264 |L| \u2264 0.9. For what concerns the additional number of relativistic relics, the maximum likelihood model\neff\nhas \u2206Nothers\n= 0, and the expectation value over the\neff\nmarginalized probability function is \u2206Nothers\n= 0.3. The\neff\n95% confidence region is \u22120.7 \u2264 \u2206Nothers \u2264 1.3. This\neff\ncan\nopening towards smaller, negative values of \u2206Nothers\nbe ascribed to the fact that such values produce a lowering of the acoustic peak, that can be compensated by a\nlarger degeneracy parameter.

The basic reason is\nthat, as can be seen from the likelihood curves, models\nwith \u03c9\u03bd > 0 can be statistically significant. For these\neff\nare not exactly degenerate.\nmodels, \u2206N\u03bdeff and \u2206Nothers\nIn order to better study the partial degeneracy beeff\ntween |\u03be| and \u2206Nothers\n, and then to understand how the\neff\nvalue of \u2206Nothers affects the estimation of the degeneracy parameter, we compute the likelihood curve for the\neff\ndegeneracy parameter for particular values of \u2206Nothers\n.\nThe results are shown in Table III. . From this table, a\nquite evident trend appears, namely that for large values\neff\nof \u2206Nothers\n, smaller values of |\u03be| are preferred, and viceversa. As already noticed, this is probably related to the\neff\nfact that when \u2206Nothers\nis increased, it remains less room\nfor the extra energy density of neutrinos coming from the\nnon-vanishing degeneracy parameter. It is worth noting\neff\nthat, for \u2206Nothers\n\u2243 0, the case \u03be = 0 lies outside the\n95% confidence region. We stress the fact that, according to theoretical predictions, in models of degenerate\nBBN with \"3+1\" neutrino mixing, if chemical potentials\nare large (\u03be > 0.05), the production of sterile neutrinos is\neff\nsuppressed, effectively resulting in \u2206Nothers\n= 0 [11, 12].\n\n. 0.044\n0.60+0.50\n\u22120.60\n\nDegeneracy parameter, |\u03be|\nNeutrino mass in eV, m\u03bd\n\n. 1.2\n\nLepton asymmetry, |L|\n\n0.46+0.43\n\u22120.46\n\nEffective number of additional\neff\nrelativistic relics, \u2206Nothers\n\n0.30 \u00b1 1.0\n\nEffective number of additional\nrelativistic relics, \u2206N eff\n\n0.70+1.40\n\u22121.15\n\neff\nTABLE III: Correlation between \u03be and \u2206Nothers\neff\n\u2206Nothers\n\n0\n\n\u03be\n(95% Confidence Interval)\n0.65 \u00b1 0.58\n\n0.5\n\n0.42+0.58\n\u22120.42\n\n1.0\n\n0.18+0.58\n\u22120.18\n\n1.5\n\n\u2264 0.53\n\n2.0\n\n\u2264 0.29\n\nVII.\n\nCONCLUSIONS AND PERSPECTIVES\n\nIn this paper, we have studied the possibility to constraint the lepton asymmetry of the Universe, the sum\nof neutrino masses, and the energy density of relativistic particles using the WMAP data, in the framework of\nan extended flat \u039bCDM model. Despite the fact that\n\n\f10\nthe current amount of cosmological data can be rather\ncoherently explained by the standard picture with three\nthermally distributed neutrinos, vanishing lepton asymmetry and no additional particle species, nevertheless we\nthink that it is useful to explore how non-standard scenarios are constrained by the cosmological observables.\nWe have concentrated our attention to models with a\n(eventually large) net lepton asymmetry (corresponding\nto a non-zero degeneracy parameter for neutrinos). Such\nmodels are motivated in the framework of extensions to\nthe standard model of particle physics, and can possibly\nexplain the observed amount of baryon asymmetry in the\nUniverse. Having in mind this, we have also included the\nenergy density of relativistic species as an independent\nparameter. In this last aspect, our approach differs from\nprevious ones, where the two parameters where considered degenerate. We have remarked that, although an\napproximate degeneracy between the two exists, it could\nbe broken by finite mass effect, especially in the case of\nneutrino masses saturating the tritium beta decay bound.\nWhen considering perfect lepton symmetry , our results are in agreement with previous ones. In the more\ngeneral case, we have found that, at the 2\u03c3 level the\nbounds on the degeneracy parameter and lepton asymmetry are respectively 0 \u2264 |\u03be| \u2264 1.1 and 0 \u2264 |L| \u2264 0.9.\nThe effective number of additional relativistic species (excluding the contribution from the non standard thermal\ndistribution of neutrinos) is bounded as follows (95%\neff\n\u2264 1.3. Including also neuCL): \u22120.7 \u2264 \u2206Nothers\ntrinos, this reads \u22120.45 \u2264 \u2206N eff \u2264 2.10. This limit\nis much more restrictive than the ones found in similar\nanalysis [9, 10]. This is probably due to the fact that we\nassume a very strong prior on the Hubble parameter, fixing h = 0.72. The physical explanation is that the later\nmatter-radiation equality due to \u2206N eff > 0 can be compensated by making \u03c9m = \u03a9m h2 larger, and viceversa.\nThis gives rise to a partial degeneracy between \u2206N eff\nand h, thus making the costraints on both parameters\nlooser unless some external prior is imposed to break the\ndegeneracy.\nWe also find that the data are compatible with \u03c9\u03bd and\nm\u03bd equal to 0, with upper bounds (95% CL) \u03c9\u03bd \u2264 0.044\nand m\u03bd \u2264 1.2 eV. This bounds are larger than the ones\nusually found, and this is probably due on one hand to\nthe presence of a larger energy density of UR particles,\nand on the other hand to the wide grid spacing we have\nused.\n\nThe usual scenario, with |L| = 0 and \u2206N eff = 0, is\nthen compatible with WMAP data at the 2\u03c3 level; however the likelihood curves show that alternative scenarios\nwith \u03be \u2243 0.6 and \u2206N eff \u2243 0.7 have a larger likelihood\nwith respect to the data. In effect, the standard scenario lies outside the 1\u03c3 confidence region. Even if this\nis not enough to definitely claim evidence, in the CMB\nanisotropy spectrum, of exotic physics, we think that it\nis however interesting that non-standard models are not\nruled out but actually preferred by the WMAP data.\nWe have also studied how the results on the lepton\nasymmetry can change when more precise information on\nthe energy density of relativistic particles is given. We\nhave shown that, the smaller is the extra energy density,\nthe larger is the allowed lepton asymmetry. In particueff\nlar, for models with vanishing \u2206Nothers\n, perfect lepton\nsymmetry is ruled out at the 2\u03c3 level. This is probably\ndue to the approximate degeneracy between \u2206N eff and\n\u03be. The issue of the exact extent of this degeneracy is still\nopen, and we think that it deserves a deeper attention.\nIt would be desirable to investigate if future precision\nCMB experiments, and in particular the PLANCK mission, can clearly disentangle the two parameters. Even\nmore promising to this purpose is the power spectrum of\nLSS, as we have stressed in Sec. IV.\nThe results presented in this paper have been derived\nassuming that the three neutrino families have all the\nsame mass and chemical potential, owing to the structure of the CMBFast code used to generate the theoretical\npower spectra. It is yet to investigate the role of a nonuniform distribution of the lepton asymmetry between\ndifferent families. In a similar way we did not investigate\nmodels in which chemical equilibrium between neutrinos\nand antineutrinos does not hold, implying \u03be\u03bd 6= \u2212\u03be\u03bd\u0304 .\nWe conclude then that WMAP data still cannot exclude the presence of non-standard physics in the early\nevolution of the Universe. In particular, they do not\nexclude the presence of a large neutrino asymmetry, and\nconsequently they do not rule out exotic leptogenesis scenario where a large lepton number is produced.\n\n[1] D.
