This effect is so strong\nthat it leads to another interesting phenomenon, i.e., the total probability of successful multiple\nlinear optical teleportation is higher for nonmaximally entangled states than maximally entangled\nstates.\nPACS numbers: 03.67.Lx, 42.50.Dv\n\nOne of the main activities in quantum computation\nfield is linear optical processing of quantum information\n[1]. In particular, the very first experimental demonstration of quantum teleportation was based on linear\noptics [2]. However, the teleportation only had a success\nprobability of 25% partially due to the impossibility of\nperforming complete Bell measurement [3]. In order to\nperform scalable quantum computation, it is of essential\nimportance to improve this success probability to a value\nclose to 100%. Recently, Knill, Laflamme, and Milburn\n(KLM) [4] have shown that the probability of success\nfor the teleportation of a superposition of vacuum and\none photon Fock state can indeed be increased by using\na maximally entangled state of two N + 1 dimensional\nHilbert spaces encoded in N photons. The probability\nthat teleportation succeeds is then equal to 1 \u2212 N1+1 .\nMoreover, when teleportation succeeds, the fidelity of the\nteleported qubit is equal to 1. Spedalieri et al. [5] generalized their protocol for polarization encoding of a qubit,\ni.e., when one uses horizontal and vertical polarizations\nrather than photon number states to represent the logical values 0 and 1. Franson et al. [6] proposed a different scheme, which does not require that a qubit has\nto be teleported with the perfect fidelity but rather assumes that the qubit is always teleported successfully and\naims at maximizing the average fidelity. Their scheme is\nbased in fact on the KLM scheme with another carefully\nchosen entangled state. Franson et al. have shown that\ntheir scheme gives better average fidelity of the teleported\nqubit than the KLM scheme. In [7] we have shown that if\nthe aim is maximization of the probability of successful\nteleportation and one requires unit fidelity of the teleported qubit then the state used in the original KLM\nscheme is optimal. Thus, the maximally entangled state\nis best suited for single quantum teleportation.\nIn this paper we consider several subsequent linear optical teleportations, i.e., the qubit is teleported from A\nto C, then from C to D, and so on, and finally to B.\nWe show an interesting phenomenon that when the fi-\n\nnal unit fidelity of the teleported qubit is required after\ncompletion of all teleportations then the nonmaximally\nentangled states give higher probability of successful teleportation than the maximally entangled ones. It is surprising because usually maximally entangled states are\noptimal for information-theoretical tasks [8].\nLet us begin with description of a generalization of the\nKLM scheme of linear optical teleportation to the one\nwhich is based on the nonmaximally entangled states [6].\nIn this scheme one uses the following entangled state\n|tN i =\n\nN\nX\ni=0\n\nci |V ii |HiN \u2212i |Hii |V iN \u2212i ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere |V ii stands for |V i1 |V i2 ...|V ii , i.e., one vertically\npolarized photon in each of the subsequent modes. Similarly, |HiN \u2212i stands for |Hii+1 |Hii+2 ...|HiN i.e., one\nhorizontally polarized photon in each of the subsequent\nmodes. If we use the states {|V ii |HiN \u2212i : i = 0, 1, ..., N }\nand {|Hii |V iN \u2212i : i = 0, 1, ..., N } as the orthonormal basis states of Alice's and Bob's Hilbert spaces, respectively,\nwe may treat the state of Eq. (1) as a bipartite entangled state. For ci = \u221aN1+1 we obtain a maximally entangled state. In order to teleport a qubit in the state\n|\u03c8i = \u03b1|Hi + \u03b2|V i Alice applies the (N + 1)-point quantum Fourier transform to the input mode and the N first\nmodes of the state |tN i, which is given by:\nN\nX\n1\n\u03c9 klk vl\u2020k ,\nFN (vk\u2020 ) = \u221a\nN + 1 l =0\nk\n\nN\nX\n1\nFN (h\u2020k ) = \u221a\n\u03c9 klk h\u2020lk .\nN + 1 l =0\n\n(2)\n\nk\n\nIn the above equations vk\u2020 and h\u2020k are the creation operators for vertically and horizontally polarized photons\nin mode k, respectively, and \u03c9 = ei2\u03c0/(N +1) . After this\ntransformation the state of the system is\n\n\f2\n\n\u0010\n\nN\nN\n\u0011N +2 X\nX\nPN\n1\n\u221a\n(\u03c9 k=0 klk \u03b1h\u2020l0 vl\u20201 ...vl\u2020i h\u2020li+1 ...h\u2020lN + \u03b2vl\u20200 vl\u20201 ...vl\u2020i h\u2020li+1 ...h\u2020lN )ci |V ACi0...N |Hii |V iN \u2212i . (3)\nN +1\ni=0 l ,...l =0\n0\n\nN\n\nNote that in the first term there are i creation operators for vertically polarized photons while in the second\nterm there are i + 1 creation operators for vertically polarized photons. Next, Alice measures the total number\nof vertically polarized photons and horizontally polarized\n\nphotons in each of the first N + 1 modes. If she detects\nvj vertically polarized photons and hj horizontally polarized photons in mode j then the state of the last N\nmodes is\n\nPN\n1\n(\u03b1cm |Hi + \u03b2cm\u22121 \u03c9 \u2212 j=0 j(vj +hj ) |V i)|V iN \u2212m ,\n|Him\u22121 p\np(m)\n\nPN\nwhere 0 < m =\nj=0 vj < N + 1 is the total number of vertically polarized photons detected and p(m) =\n|\u03b1cm |2 + |\u03b2cm\u22121 |2 is the total probability of detecting m\nvertically polarized photons. However, if Alice detects 0\nor N + 1 vertically polarized photons, then the state of\nthe qubit is irreversibly destroyed, which happens with\nthe average probability of 21 (|c0 |2 + |cN |2 ). One can see\nthat the modified state of the teleported qubit is found\nin the N + mth mode. After correction of the phase, this\nstate becomes\n1\n(\u03b1cm |Hi + \u03b2cm\u22121 |V i).\n|\u03c8m i = p\np(m)\n\n|cm\u22121 |2\n.\np(m)\n\ndetected, then the teleportation fails. Hence, we restrict\nthe summation over m from 1 to N . We obtain:\np(S) =\n\nN\nX\n\np(S, m) =\n\nm=1\n\n=\n(6)\n\nfor |cm\u22121 | \u2264 |cm |. A similar measurement exists if\n|cm\u22121 | > |cm |. When ES is applied, then the qubit ends\nin its original state |\u03a8i = \u03b1|Hi + \u03b2|V i. The probability\nof successful error correction is:\np(S|m) = h\u03c8m |ES\u2020 ES |\u03c8m i =\n\nFIG. 1: Several subsequent teleportations. A better strategy\nis not to perform error correction at C, D and so on but to\nperform it at B after completion of all teleportations.\n\n(5)\n\nThe qubit can be returned to its original state by performing the generalized measurement given by the Kraus\noperators:\ncm\u22121\n|HihH| + |V ihV |,\nES =\ncm\ns\n2\ncm\u22121\nEF = 1 \u2212\n|HihH|,\ncm\n\n(4)\n\n(7)\n\nIn [7] we described how such a measurement can be implemented experimentally with linear optics. In order to\nobtain the total probability of a successful teleportation,\nwe have to sum up the joint probabilities of detecting m\nvertically polarized photons and a successful error correction. Let us recall that if 0 or N + 1 photons are\n\nN\nX\n\nm=1\n\np(S|m)p(m) =\n\nN\nX\n\nm=1\n\nmin{|cm\u22121 |2 , |cm |2 }.\n\n(8)\n\nLet us now suppose that the qubit is to be teleported\nonce again (see Fig. 1). Then the simplest strategy is\nto perform the first teleportation followed by the error\ncorrection, then the second teleportation followed by the\nerror correction. However, it is not the optimal strategy.\nLet us, thus, assume that we do not correct the error introduced in the first teleportation and teleport the qubit\nonce again with the use of the identical entangled state.\nAfter the second teleportation, the state of the qubit is\n1\n|\u03c8m,n i = p\n(\u03b1cm cn |Hi + \u03b2cm\u22121 cn\u22121 |V i), (9)\np(m, n)\n\nwhere p(m, n) is the joint probability of detecting m vertically polarized photons in the first teleportation and n\n\n\f3\nvertically polarized photons in the second teleportation,\nand is given by:\np(m, n) = p(n|m)p(m) = |\u03b1cm cn |2 +|\u03b2cm\u22121 cn\u22121 |2 . (10)\nIf cm = cn\u22121 and cn = cm\u22121 , then the state of the qubit\nis\n|\u03c8m,n i = \u03b1|Hi + \u03b2|V i;\n\nES =\n\n(13)\n\np\u2032 (S, m, n) = min(|cm |2 , |cm\u22121 |2 )min(|cn |2 , |cn\u22121 |2 ),\n(14)\nwhich is lower or equal to the previous probability. Moreover, if (|cm\u22121 | > |cm | and |cn\u22121 | < |cn |) or (|cm\u22121 | <\n|cm | and |cn\u22121 | > |cn |), then the probability p\u2032 (S, m, n) is\nlower than the probability p(S, m, n). We conclude that\nit is better to perform the error correction at the end\nwhen all teleportations were completed.\nLet us now suppose that we perform M subsequent\nteleportations with the use of the identical entangled\nstates of Eq. (1). A straightforward calculation gives the\nfollowing probability of detecting m1 , m2 ,..., mM vertically polarized photons in the first, second,..., M th teleportation and the final successful error correction\np(S, m1 , m2 , ...mM ) =\nmin(|cm1 cm2 ...cmM | , |cm1 \u22121 cm2 \u22121 ...cmM \u22121 |2 ).\n\n0.1\n0.05\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\nFIG. 2: Exemplary series of coefficients |ci |2 of entangled state\nof Eq.

The second teleportation\ncorrected the error introduced by the first teleportation.\nWe call this effect the error self-correction. A similar\neffect occurs for entanglement swapping as considered by\nAcin, Cirac, and Lewenstein [9] (see also: [10, 11, 12, 13]).\nIn general, if |cm\u22121 cn\u22121 | < |cm cn |, then one can recover\nthe original state of the qubit by performing generalized\nmeasurement given by the Kraus operators:\ncm\u22121 cn\u22121\n|HihH| + |V ihV |,\nc c\nsm n\n2\ncm\u22121 cn\u22121\n|HihH|.\nEF = 1 \u2212\ncm cn\n\n0.25\n\n(15)\n\nmin(|cm1 cm2 ...cmM |2 , |cm1 \u22121 cm2 \u22121 ...cmM \u22121 |2 ).\n\n(16)\n\nLet us now take the following six-photon entangled\nstate whose coefficients ci depend on the parameter x\n(see Fig. 2)\n|t6 i =\n\n6\nX\ni=0\n\nr\n\n1 \u2212 9x\n+ (3 \u2212 |i \u2212 3|)x\n7\n|V ii |Hi6\u2212i |Hii |V i6\u2212i .\n\n(17)\n\nThe coefficients are symmetric around i = 3 and the parameter x is the slope of the line connecting the points\n(i, |ci |2 ). For x = 0 the state is maximally entangled.\nNote that for x > 0, the smallest coefficients are c0\nand c6 . On the other hand, the average probability that\nthe state of the teleported qubit will be irreversibly destroyed during teleportation (and before error correction)\nis 21 (|c0 |2 +|c6 |2 ). We can lower this probability by lowering the coefficients c0 and c6 . We should remember that\nin such a case we increase the probability that the state\nwill be irreversibly destroyed during error correction. Let\nus calculate with the help of Eq. (16) the total probability of successful six subsequent teleportations of a qubit\nwith the error correction at the end.\nIn Fig. 3 we present how probability of successful multiple teleportation depends on the parameter x. For x = 0,\nthe probability of successful teleportation is p = 0.3965.\nHowever, for x \u2265 0 this probability slowly increases with\nx reaching its maximal value p = 0.4152 for x = 0.0366.\nHence, we obtain an interesting phenomenon \u2013 the probability of the successful multiple teleportation is greater\nfor nonmaximally entangled states than for maximally\n\n\f4\n\n0.41\n0.02\n\n0.04\n\n0.06\n\n0.08\n\n0.1\n\n0.39\n0.38\n0.37\nFIG. 3: Probability of successful six teleportations with entangled state of Eq.

It should be compared with the probability of successful single teleportation which reaches always\nits maximal value for maximally entangled state [7]. Let\nus also point out that the probability for x = 0 is equal\nto the product of probabilities of each successful teleportation, i.e., p = ( 67 )6 = 0.3965. We can see that if we use\nnonmaximally entangled states we have an increase in the\nprobability p(0.0366) \u2212 p(0) = 0.0187. The relative increase in the probability is p(0.0366)\u2212p(0)\n= 0.0471. Thus,\np(0)\nthe use of nonmaximally entangled states contributes in\nabout 5% to the total probability. The effect may be\neven stronger when one increases the number of photons\nin the entangled state and/or the number of subsequent\nteleportations. It is also interesting to calculate the probability p\u2032 (0.0366) of successful teleportation when one\nperforms error correction between subsequent teleportations. We obtain p\u2032 (0.0366) = 0.2511. This probability\nis lower than the probability of successful teleportation\nwith the final error correction p(0.0366) = 0.4152. The\nincrease in the probability due to the error self-correction\nis p(0.0366) \u2212 p\u2032 (0.0366) = 0.1641 and the relative in\u2032\n(0.0366)\n= 0.6535.\ncrease is p(0.0366)\u2212p\np\u2032 (0.0366)\nLet us now have a look at the origin of this effect. The\nteleportation does not succeed when one of the senders\ndetects 0 or N +1 vertically polarized photons which happens with the average probabilities of 12 |c0 |2 and 21 |cN |2 ,\nrespectively. We can decrease this probabilities by decreasing the coefficients c0 and cN . If we do it and\nperform single teleportation, then the error correction is\nneeded. The probabilistic nature of the error correction\ndecreases the total probability of successful teleportation\nand there is no gain. However, if we perform several teleportations with no error correction between subsequent\nteleportations, then the error self-correction may occur.\nThis error self-correction may correct the errors or increase the probability of a successful error correction at\nthe end. This effect allows us to obtain higher probability\n\nof successful teleportations with nonmaximally entangled\nstates which have smoothly lowered the probabilities of\nhaving 0 and N vertically polarized photons.\nIn summary, we have considered several subsequent\nteleportations of a qubit in the KLM scheme. We have\nshown how the errors introduced in the previous teleportations can be corrected by the errors introduced in the\nfollowing teleportations. This effect leads to an interesting new phenomenon. Namely nonmaximally entangled\nstates can be better for multiple linear optical teleportation. This strange behavior is connected to the fact that\nwith linear optics one cannot perform the complete Bell\nmeasurement and hence, quantum teleportation can be\nimplemented only probabilistically [3]. We believe that\nour research will lead to deeper understanding of manipulation of entanglement with local linear optical operations\nand classical communication which are a natural analog\nof local operations and classical communication usually\nconsidered in entanglement theory. Our result may have\napplications in linear optical quantum computation and\nquantum networks.\nWe thank Adam Miranowicz for independent numerical checking of our results.
