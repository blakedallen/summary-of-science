K. Law\nDepartment of Physics, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, Hong Kong SAR, China\n(Dated: June 27, 2018)\n\narXiv:quant-ph/0411040v1 5 Nov 2004\n\nWe consider a composite particle formed by two fermions or two bosons. We discover that\ncomposite behavior is deeply related to the quantum entanglement between the constituent particles.\nBy analyzing the properties of creation and annihilation operators, we show that bosonic character\nemerges if the constituent particles become strongly entangled. Such a connection is demonstrated\nexplicitly in a class of two-particle wave functions.\nPACS numbers: 03.67.-a, 03.65.Ta, 03.67.Mn\n\nIn Nature many particles are composite particles formed by two or more fundamental fermions. Atoms, molecules\nand nuclei are familiar examples of composite particles. As long as physical processes do not reveal the internal\nstructure, a composite particle as a whole can be treated approximately as a point-like boson (fermion) if the number\nof constituent fermions is even (odd). Intuitively, the more compact the composite particle is, the better it behaves\nas a pure boson or fermion. This raises interesting questions how the degree of compositeness is quantified, and\nwhat physical effects would appear if the internal structure becomes apparent. In the case of particles formed by\ntwo fermions, several authors have addressed the compositeness effects of atoms in Bose-Einstein condensates [1, 2]\nand electron-hole pairs in semiconductor [2, 3]. In particular, Combescot and Tanguy have indicated the deviation of\npurely bosonic behavior, based on the properties of the creation operator associated with composite particles [3].\nThe issue of compositeness also appears in particles made of bosons. An important example of this kind is biphoton\nstates generated by optical spontaneous parametric down conversion. Such highly correlated photons have been\nemployed in fundamental experiments, e.g., to test the violation of Bell's inequality [4], and to realize EinsteinPodolsky-Rosen paradox [5]. Recent experiments have also explored the 'binding' effects revealed from the de Broglie\nwavelength of biphotons [6, 7]. Interestingly, although the constituent photons are non-interacting and they can be\nspatially separated, the composite nature of biphotons can still be detected by suitable interference schemes. This\nsuggests that the concept of compositeness is not limited to mechanically bounded particles in position space.\nIn this paper we examine the composite representation of two-particle systems from the view point of quantum\ninformation. We show that quantum entanglement provides an understanding of the origin of composite behavior.\nAs we shall see below, the degree of entanglement between constituent particles determines how close a composite\nparticle behave as a pure boson. This implies an interesting picture that constituent particles are somehow bounded\nby quantum entanglement. Mechanical binding forces are not essential, they serve only as physical means to enforce\nquantum correlations. Since the constituent particles can be correlated in many different ways, the composite representation is not limited to position space or momentum space. In this paper we will indicate the fundamental role\nof entanglement, based on the properties of creation and annihilation operators associated with composite particles.\nIn contrast to previous studies that concern only fermionic constituent particles, we provide a general analysis that\napplies to bosonic constituents as well.\nTo begin with, we consider a composite particle C formed by two distinguishable particles A and B. Both A and B\nare either fermions or bosons. Let \u03a8(xA , xB ) be the wave function of the two-particle system, we can always express\nthe wave function in the Schmidt decomposition form:\n\u03a8(xA , xB ) =\n\n\u221e p\nX\n(B)\n\u03bbn \u03c6(A)\nn (xA )\u03c6n (xB )\n\n(1)\n\nn=0\n(A)\n\n(B)\n\n(A)\n\nwhere the Schmidt modes \u03c6n (\u03c6n ) form a complete and orthonormal set for particle A (B). Specifically, \u03c6n\n(B)\nand \u03bbn are defined by the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the reduced density matrix of particle A, and \u03c6n can be\nobtained similarly from the reduced density matrix of particle B. Eq. (1) reveals the quantum correlation by showing\n(A)\nthe pairing structure explicitly. If the particle A appears in the mode \u03c6n , then with certainty the particle B must\n(B)\nbe in the mode \u03c6n . The distribution\nP of \u03bbn provides a measure of entanglement. This is usually discussed in terms\nof the entanglement entropy E = \u2212 n \u03bbn log2 \u03bbn . However, a more transparent measure of entanglement is to count\nthe 'average' number of Schmidt modes actively involved. The Schmidt number K provides this information [8, 9]:\nK \u2261 1/\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nn=0\n\n\u03bb2n .\n\n(2)\n\n\f2\nThe larger the value of K is, the higher the entanglement. In fact, K equals the inverse of the purity of single-particle\ndensity matrix, and it also equals the linear entropy apart from a constant. A disentangled (product) state corresponds\nto K = 1, i.e., only one term in the Schmidt decomposition. If a Schmidt decomposition contains M terms of equal\nweight (i.e., \u03bbn = 1/M for n = 1, 2, .., M ), then we have K = M which is exactly the number of mode pairs involved.\nIn the second quantized representation, Eq. (1) corresponds to a state generated by a creation operator c\u2020 acting\non the vacuum. Such a creation operator is defined by,\nc\u2020 =\n\n\u221e p\nX\n\u03bbn a\u2020n b\u2020n\n\n(3)\n\nn=0\n\n(A)\n\nwhere a\u2020n (b\u2020n ) is the creation operator of the particle A (B) in the Schmidt mode \u03c6n\nrelation between c and c\u2020 is given by,\n\n(B)\n\n(\u03c6n ). The commutation\n\n[c, c\u2020 ] = 1 + s\u2206,\n\n(4)\n\nwhere s = +1 if A and B are bosons, s = \u22121 if A and B are fermions. The operator \u2206 in Eq. (4) is defined by,\n\u2206=\n\n\u221e\nX\n\n\u03bbn a\u2020n an + b\u2020n bn\n\nn=0\n\n\u0001\n\n(5)\n\nwhich has non-zero matrix elements, depending on the states involved. Therefore c and c\u2020 are not strictly bosonic\noperators.\nTo examine the properties of c and c\u2020 , we consider a system containing two or more C particles. Let us define the\nN \u2212particle states by,\n\u22121/2\n\n|N i \u2261 \u03c7N\n\nc\u2020N\n\u221a |0i\nN!\n\n(6)\n\nwhere \u03c7N is a normalization constant such that hN |N i = 1. In order to test how good the operator c behaves as\na bosonic annihilation operator, we need to determine how the operator acts on |N i. This is given by a general\nequation:\n\u221a\n(7)\nc |N i = \u03b1N N |N \u2212 1i + |\u03b5N i ,\nwhere \u03b1N is a constant, and the correction term |\u03b5N i is orthogonal to |N \u2212 1i. Such a correction term is necessary\nbecause the set of |N i states (with all N ) is only a subset of the entire Hilbert space associated with the constituent\nparticles. A non-ideal bosonic operator would inevitably cause transitions into the states not described by (6).\nFrom Eq. (7), the annihilation operator c is bosonic if the following two conditions are satisfied:\n\u03b1N \u2192 1\nh\u03b5N |\u03b5N i \u2192 0.\n\n(8)\n(9)\n\nAfter some calculations [10], for N > 1, we have\nr\n\u03c7N\n\u03b1N =\n\u03c7N \u22121\nh\u03b5N |\u03b5N i = 1 \u2212 N\n\n(10)\n\u03c7N +1\n\u03c7N\n+ (N \u2212 1)\n.\n\u03c7N \u22121\n\u03c7N\n\n(11)\n\nTherefore the conditions (8) and (9) are controlled by the ratio of normalization constants. An ideal composite boson\nemerges in the limit \u03c7N \u00b11 /\u03c7N \u2192 1.\nFor convenience, let us write\n\u001a F\n\u03c7N\nA, B are fermions\n\u03c7N =\n(12)\n\u03c7B\nA, B are bosons.\nN\nF\nBy carefully counting the states allowed for ferimons and bosons, it can be shown that \u03c7B\nN and \u03c7N are given by [11],\nX\n\u03c7B\n(13)\n\u03bbp1 \u03bbp2 ....\u03bbpN\nN = N!\npN \u2265pN \u22121 \u2265....\u2265p2 \u2265p1\n\n\u03c7F\nN\n\n= N!\n\nX\n\npN >pN \u22121 >....>p2 >p1\n\n\u03bbp1 \u03bbp2 ....\u03bbpN .\n\n(14)\n\n\f3\nThe calculation of these summations can be quite complicated in general. In the case particles A and B are fermions,\n\u03c7F\nN can be analyzed by methods discussed in Ref. [3]. However, exact analytical expressions of \u03c7N for both fermions\nand bosons in closed forms are rare.\nIn this paper we consider a realistic class of two-particle wave functions that allows exact closed form expressions\nof \u03c7N . Such a class of two-particle wave functions is specified by the Schmidt eigenvalues,\n\u03bbn = (1 \u2212 z)z n\n\nn = 0, 1, 2...\n\n(15)\n\nwhere the parameter z is defined in the range 0 < z < 1. This parameter determines how rapid \u03bbn decreases with n.\nA representative example of this class of wave functions is (double) gaussian given by:\n\u03a8(xA , xB ) = N e\u2212(xA +xB )\n\n2\n\n/\u03c3c2 (xA \u2212xB )2 /\u03c3r2\n\ne\n\n.\n\n(16)\n\nHere N is a normalization constant, and \u03c3c and \u03c3r are widths along the xA + xB and xA \u2212 xB directions respectively.\nThe Schmidt decomposition of Eq. (16) gives \u03bbn 's in the form of Eq. (15) with\n\u00132\n\u0012\n\u03c3r \u2212 \u03c3c\n.\n(17)\nz=\n\u03c3r + \u03c3c\nThe corresponding Schmidt modes in this example are simply the eigenfunctions of a harmonic oscillator.\nF\nTo evaluate \u03c7B\nN and \u03c7N , we let: p1 = qN , p2 = qN + qN \u22121 , p3 = qN + qN \u22121 + qN \u22122 ,.... pN = qN + qN \u22121 + ... + q1 ,\nthen Eq. (13) and (14) become,\n\u221e X\n\u221e\nX\n\nN\n\u03c7B\nN = N !(1 \u2212 z)\nN\n\u03c7F\nN = N !(1 \u2212 z)\n\n.....\n\nq1 =0 q2 =0\n\u221e X\n\u221e\nX\n\n.....\n\nq1 =1 q2 =1\n\n\u221e\nX\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nz q1 +2q2 +3q3 +...+N qN\n\n(18)\n\nz q1 +2q2 +3q3 +...+N qN .\n\n(19)\n\nqN \u22121 =0 qN =0\n\u221e\nX\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nqN \u22121 =1 qN =0\n\nThese summations can now be carried out easily,\n\u03c7B\nN =\n\u03c7F\nN =\n\nN !(1 \u2212 z)N\n(1 \u2212 z)(1 \u2212 z 2 )....(1 \u2212 z N )\n\nN !z N (N \u22121)/2 (1 \u2212 z)N\n.\n(1 \u2212 z)(1 \u2212 z 2 )....(1 \u2212 z N )\n\n(20)\n(21)\n\nHence the normalization ratios are given by,\n\u03c7B\n(N + 1)(1 \u2212 z)\nN +1\n=\nB\n(1 \u2212 z N +1 )\n\u03c7N\n\n\u03c7F\n(N + 1)(1 \u2212 z)\nN +1\n.\n= zN\n(1 \u2212 z N +1 )\n\u03c7F\nN\n\n(22)\n(23)\n\nFrom Eq. (7) and (10), the normalization ratio determines the modification of Bose enhancement factor. The results\nB\nF\nF\nEq. (22) and (23) indicate that \u03c7B\nN +1 /\u03c7N > 1 and \u03c7N +1 /\u03c7N < 1. The difference between the two types of constituents\ncan be understood, because bosons tend to stay together in the same state, while fermions do the opposite due to\nthe exclusion principle. However, quantum statistics of constituent particles becomes less important as z approaches\none, where the composite particle become a pure boson. In the example of double gaussian wave function (16), the\nz \u2192 1 limit correspond to the cases \u03c3r \u226b \u03c3c or \u03c3c \u226b \u03c3r . We remark that that the particle number N is a key factor\nin Eq. (22) and (23). A larger number of particle number would require the value of z to be closer to one in order to\nmaintain the normalization ratio.\nNow we can make an explicit connection with quantum entanglement. For the Schmidt eigenvalues given by (15),\nthe Schmidt number K defined in Eq. (2) takes the form:\nK=\n\n1 \u2212 z2\n(1 \u2212 z)2\n\n(24)\n\nB\nwhich is a monotonic increasing function in the range 0 < z < 1. By expressing z in terms of K, both \u03c7B\nN +1 /\u03c7N\nF\nF\nand \u03c7N +1 /\u03c7N can be directly related to the degree of quantum entanglement. As K increases, we find that both\n\n\f4\nB\nF\nF\n\u03c7B\nN +1 /\u03c7N and \u03c7N +1 /\u03c7N approach one monotonically for the entire range of K. In particular, it can be shown that\nfor K \u226b N ,\n\n\u03c7N +1 /\u03c7N \u2248 1 + sN/K\n\n(25)\n\nwhere s defined in Eq. (4). Since the value of K corresponds to an effective number of Schmidt modes [8], bosonic\nparticle description is valid when the effective number of Schmidt modes is much greater than the total number of\ncomposite particles.\nThe discussion above indicates that composite behavior strictly depends on the degree of quantum entanglement,\nat least for the class of two-particle wave functions with Schmidt eigenvalues specified by Eq. (15). We note that\nEq. (15) corresponds to a wide variety of wave functions, because Schmidt modes can be chosen from any discrete,\ncomplete and orthogonal set of basis functions. Indeed, Schmidt modes do not play any role in determining \u03c7N . It is\nthe distribution of \u03bbn that controls the compositeness of the particle. As long as the Schmidt eigenvalues are specified\nby (15), different forms of Schmidt modes correspond to the same degree of compositeness. This also shares the same\nfeature with quantum entanglement.\nTo summarize, our work here examine the foundation of composite representation of two-particle systems. Within\nthe class of two-particle wave functions, we show that the origin of composite behavior is ultimately related to quantum\nentanglement between constituent particles. Therefore composite representation can be applied to strongly entangled\nparticles, which are not limited to mechanically bounded systems. Finally, we remark that the wave functions\nsatisfying Eq. (15) are not completely general, but owing to flexibility of the parameter z, these functions may be\nused to approximate wave functions in actual situations. This suggests that the relation between composite behavior\nand the degree of quantum entanglement can be quite general. However, a full analysis would require the study of\nEq. (13) and (14) for arbitrary distribution of Schmidt eigenvalues, which is a topic open for future investigations.\nAcknowledgments\n\nThe author thanks Prof. M.-C. Chu for discussions.

(13), we write\nc\u2020N |0i =\n\nX\n\nkN \u2265kN \u22121 \u2265.....\u2265k1\n\np\n\n\u03bbk1 \u03bbk2 ......\u03bbkN F (k1 , k2 , ..., kN ) |k1 , k2 , ..., kN i\n\nwhere |kj i denotes the occupation with an A particle and a B particle in the Schmidt mode kj , and F (k1 , k2 , ..., kN ) is the\nweight factor for the state |k1 , k2 , ..., kN i. If these k's have d same terms (e.g. k1 = k2 = ... = kd ), and all others terms are\ndistinct, then the weigh factor should be N !/d! \u00d7 d! = N !. The d! in the nominator comes from the fact that c\u2020 contains\noperators a\u2020k b\u2020k . This argument applies to general sequence with any combinations of degenerate terms.\n\n\f"}
