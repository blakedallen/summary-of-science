In the last two decades, a great deal of activity has been concentrated on the studies of fractals [2, 3].\nIt has been shown [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11] that regular\nfractals capture important aspects of critical percolation\nclusters, aerogels, amorphous solids, and unusual phase\ntransition in the Ising model. Among various regular\nfractals, the Vicsek fractals [12] are a class of typical candidates for exact mathematical ones and have received\nmuch attention. A variety of structural and dynamical\nproperties of Vicsek fractals have been investigated in\nmuch detail, including eigenvalue spectrum [13], eigenstates [14], Laplacian spectrum [15], random walks [16],\ndiffusion [17], and so on. The results of these investigations uncovered many unusual and exotic features of\nVicsek fractals.\nA central issue in the study of complex systems is\nto understand how their dynamical behaviors are influenced by underlying geometrical and topological properties [18, 19]. Among many fundamental structural\ncharacteristics [20], mean geodesic distance is an important topological feature of complex systems that are often described by graphs (or networks) where nodes (vertices) represent the component units of systems and links\n(edges) stand for the interactions between them [21, 22].\nMean geodesic distance is defined as the mean length of\nthe shortest paths between all pairs of nodes. It has\nbeen well established that mean geodesic distance directly relates to many aspects of real systems, such as\nsignal integrity in communication networks, the propagation of beliefs in social networks or of technology\nin industrial networks. Recent studies indicated that a\nnumber of other dynamical processes are also relevant to\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\u2020 Electronic\n\naddress: zhangzz@fudan.edu.cn\naddress: sgzhou@fudan.edu.cn\n\nmean geodesic distance, including disease spreading [23],\nrandom walks [24], navigation [25], to name but a few.\nThus far great efforts have been made to valuate and\nunderstand the mean geodesic distance of different systems [26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31].\nDespite the importance of this structural property, to\nthe best of our knowledge, the rigorous computation for\nthe mean geodesic distance of Vicsek fractals has not\nbeen addressed. To fill this gap, in this present paper\nwe investigate this interesting quantity analytically. We\nderive an exact formula for the mean geodesic distance\ncharacterizing the Vicsek fractals. The analytic method\nis on the basis of an algebraic iterative procedure obtained from the self-similar structure of Vicsek fractals.\nThe obtained precise result shows that the mean geodesic\ndistance exponentially with the number of nodes. Our\nresearch opens the way to theoretically study the mean\ngeodesic distance of regular fractals and deterministic\nnetworks [32, 33, 34]. In particularly, our exact solution\ngives insight different from that afforded by the approximate solution of stochastic fractals.\nThe classical Vicsek fractals are constructed iteratively [12, 15]. We denote by Vf,t (t \u2265 0, f \u2265 2) the Vicsek fractals after t generations. The construction starts\nfrom (t = 0) a star-like cluster consist of f + 1 nodes arranged in a cross-wise pattern, where f peripheral nodes\nare connected to a central node. This corresponds to Vf,0 .\nFor t \u2265 1, Vf,t is obtained from Vf,t\u22121 . To obtain Vf,1 ,\nwe generate f replicas of Vf,0 and arrange them around\nthe periphery of the original Vf,0 , then we connect the\ncentral structure by f additional links to the corner copy\nstructures. These replication and connection steps are repeated t times, with the needed Vicsek fractals obtained\n+1)\nin the limit t \u2192 \u221e, whose fractal dimension is ln(f\nln 3 . In\nFig. 1, we show schematically the structure of V3,2 . According to the construction algorithm, at each time step\nthe number of nodes in the systems increase by a factor\nof f + 1, thus, we can easily know that the total number\nof nodes (network order) of Vf,t is Nt = (f + 1)t+1 .\nAfter introducing the Vicsek fractals, we now investi-\n\n\f2\n\nFIG. 1: Illustration of a particular Vicsek fractal V3,2 .\n\nFIG. 2: A schematic illustration of the iterative construction\nfor Vf,t+1 , which is obtained by joining f + 1 copies of Vf,t\n(1)\n(2)\n(f )\n(f +1)\ndenoted as Vf,t , Vf,t , * * * , Vf,t , and Vf,t , respectively.\n\ngate analytically the mean geodesic distance between all\nthe node pairs in the fractals. We represent all the shortest path lengths of Vf,t as a matrix in which the entry\ndij is the geodesic distance from node i to node j, where\ngeodesic distance is the path connecting two nodes with\nminimum length. The maximum value Dt of dij is called\nthe diameter of Vf,t . A measure of the typical separation\nbetween two nodes in Vf,t is given by the mean geodesic\ndistance Lt defined as the mean of geodesic lengths over\nall couples of nodes:\nLt =\n\nSt\n,\nNt (Nt \u2212 1)/2\n\n(1)\n\nwhere\nSt =\n\nX\n\ndij\n\n(2)\n\ni\u2208Vf,t , j\u2208Vf,t , i6=j\n\ndenotes the sum of the geodesic distances between two\nnodes over all pairs.\nWe continue by exhibiting the procedure of the determination of the total distance and present the recurrence\nformula, which allows us to obtain St+1 of the t + 1 generation from St of the t generation. By construction, the\nfractal Vf,t+1 is obtained by the juxtaposition of f + 1\n(1)\n(2)\ncopies of Vf,t that are consecutively labeled as Vf,t , Vf,t ,\n(f +1)\n\n* * * , Vf,t , see Fig. 2. This obvious self-similar structure allows us to calculate St analytically. It is easy to\nsee that the total distance St+1 satisfies the recursion\nrelation\nSt+1 = (f + 1) St + \u0398t ,\n\n(3)\n\nwhere \u0398t is the sum over all shortest path length whose\nendpoints are not in the same Vf,t branch. The solution\nof Eq. (3) is\nSt = (f + 1)t S0 +\n\nt\u22121\nX\n\u0002\n\nm=0\n\n\u0003\n(f + 1)t\u2212m\u22121 \u0398m .\n\n(4)\n\nThus, all that is left to obtain St is to compute \u0398m .\nThe paths that contribute to \u0398t must all go through\nat least one of the 2f edge nodes (such as G, X, Y ,\nand Z in Fig. 2) at which the different Vf,t branches are\nconnected. The analytical expression for \u0398t , named the\ncrossing path length, can be derived as below.\nDenote \u0398\u03b1,\u03b2\nas the sum of all shortest paths with endt\n(\u03b1)\n(\u03b2)\npoints in Vf,t and Vf,t . For convenience, we denote by\n(1)\n\nVf,t the central branch of Vf,t+1 . According to whether\nor not the two branches are adjacent, we sort the cross(\u03c6 > 1), \u0398\u03c6,\u03b8\ninto two classes: \u03981,\u03c6\ning path length \u0398\u03b1,\u03b2\nt\nt\nt\n(\u03c6 > 1, \u03b8 > 1, and \u03c6 6= \u03b8). For any two crossing paths\nin the same class, they have identical length. Therefore,\nin the following computation of \u0398t , we will only consider\n\u03981,2\nand \u03982,3\nt\nt . The total sum \u0398t is then given by\n\u0012 \u0013\nf\n\u0398t = f \u00d7 \u03981,2\n+\n\u00d7 \u03982,3\n(5)\nt\nt .\n2\nTo calculate the crossing path length \u03981,2\nand \u03982,3\nt\nt ,\nwe give the following definition and notations. We define\nexternal nodes of Vf,t as the nodes that will be linked to\none of its copes at step t+1 to form Vf +1,t . Let dt denote\nthe sum of length of the path from an external node of\nVf,t to all nodes in Vf,t including the external node itself.\n(1)\n(2)\nWe assume that the two branches Vf,t and Vf,t are connected at two nodes X and G, which separately belong\n(1)\n(2)\n(1)\n(3)\nto Vf,t and Vf,t , and that Vf,t and Vf,t are linked to\n(1)\n\neach other at two nodes Y and Z that are in Vf,t and\n(3)\n\nVf,t , respectively.\nIn order to determine dt , we should compute the diameter Dt of Vf,t first. By construction, one can see that\nthe diameter Dt equals the path length between arbitrary pair of external nodes of Vf,t . Thus, we have the\n\n\f3\nfollowing recursive relation:\nDt+1 = 3 Dt + 2.\n\n(6)\n\nConsidering the initial condition D0 = 2, Eq. (6) is solved\ninductively to obtain\nDt = 3t+1 \u2212 1,\n\n(7)\n\nwhich is independent of f .\nWe now calculate the quantity dt+1 . Let K denote the\n(2)\nexternal node of Vf,t+1 , which is in the branch Vf,t . By\ndefinition, dt+1 can be given by the sum\nX\ndt+1 =\ndKj\nj\u2208Vf,t+1\n\n=\n\nX\n\ndKu +\n\n(2)\n\ndKu + (f \u2212 1)\n\n(1)\nv\u2208Vf,t\n\ndKw\n\nw\u2208Vf,t\n\nX\n\ndKw .\n\n(8)\n\nWe denote the second and third terms in Eq. (8) by gt\nand qt , respectively. Thus, dt+1 = dt + gt + qt . The\nquantity gt is evaluated as follows:\nX\ngt =\n(dKG + dGX + dXu )\n(1)\n\nv\u2208Vf,t\n\n= dt + Nt \u00d7 (Dt + 1),\n\n(9)\n\nwhere dKX = Dt and dGX = 1 were used. Analogously,\nX\nqt = (f \u2212 1)\n(dKG + dGX + dXY + dY Z + dZw )\n(3)\n\nw\u2208Vf,t\n\n= (f \u2212 1) [dt + Nt \u00d7 2(Dt + 1)] .\n\n(10)\n\nWith Eqs. (9) and (10), Eq. (8) becomes\ndt+1 = (f + 1)dt + (2f \u2212 1) \u00d7 Nt \u00d7 (Dt + 1).\n\n(11)\n\nUsing Nt = (f + 1)t+1 , Dt = 3t+1 \u2212 1 and d0 = 2f \u2212 1,\nEq. (11) is resolved by induction\n\u0001\n1\n(12)\ndt = (2f \u2212 1) 3t+1 \u2212 1 (1 + f )t .\n2\nWith above obtained results, we can determine the\nlength of crossing paths \u03981,2\nand \u03982,3\nt\nt , which can be expressed in terms of the previously explicitly determined\nquantities.

Thus, the mean geodesic distance\ngrows exponentially with increasing size of the system. In\ncontrast to many recently studied network models mimicking real-life systems in nature and society [21, 22], the\nVicsek fractals are not small worlds despite of the fact\nthat these fractals show similarity (fractality) observed\nin many real-world systems.\nWe have checked our analytic result against numerical\ncalculations for different f and various t. In all the cases\nwe obtain a complete agreement between our theoretical\nformula and the results of numerical investigation, see\nFig. 3.\nTo sum up, in complex systems the mean geodesic distance plays an important role. It has a profound impact\n\n\f4\nalytically the solution for the mean geodesic distance of\nVicsek fractals which have been attracting much research\ninterest. We found that in the infinite network size limit\nthe mean geodesic distance scales exponentially with the\nnumber of nodes. Our analytical technique could guide\nand shed light on related studies for deterministic fractals and network models by providing a paradigm for\ncalculating the mean geodesic distance. Moreover, as a\nguide to and a test of approximate methods, we believe\nour vigorous solution can prompt the studies on random\nfractals.\n\nFIG. 3: Mean geodesic distance Lt versus network order Nt\non a log-log scale.
