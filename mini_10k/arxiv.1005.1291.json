For\nexample, the paramount achievement of LQG is the first principles derivation of a discrete\nspectrum for area and volume operators \u2013 however, this spectrum is dependent on the value\nof the parameter. Similarly, the derivation of black-hole entropy in LQG from the counting\nof the quantum mechanical microstates yields an entropy that depends, as well, on the value\nof the BI parameter. Demanding that this entropy agrees with the semi-classical derivation\nof Bekenstein and Hawking the value of the BI parameter can be fixed [6] \u2013 however, the\nderivation sheds dim light on why this particular value is special, and why the parameter\nis essential in the construction to begin with. Detractors of the theory may claim that the\nPlanck scale discreteness predicted by LQG has more to do with the quantum dynamics of\n\u2217\n\u2020\n\nElectronic address: mercuri@gravity.psu.edu\nElectronic address: arandono@perimeterinstitute.ca\n\n\f2\nthe Holst term, and less to do with generic features that one should expect from any theory\nof quantum general relativity. Indeed, one can study the Holst term alone as defining a\nquantum field theory \u2013 although the theory is a topological field theory, at the kinematical\nlevel, the quantum features of Hilbert space appear to have many of the same features as\nthe kinematical framework of full LQG [7].\nFaced with these difficulties, it is of paramount importance to understand the true nature\nof the BI parameter. In fact, a better understanding of the parameter could shed light on\nwhy, or if, the parameter is needed in the theory, and what it has to do with Planck scale\ndiscreteness.\nIt has long been suspected that the BI parameter is analogous to the theta-parameter of\nYang\u2013Mills gauge theories [8]. The similarities are difficult to ignore. However, there are\nsome key differences that have allowed the BI parameter to elude such an interpretation.\nOne of us, SM, has recently given an interpretation for the BI parameter as associated with\nthe large sector of a local gauge group, in strict analogy with the \u03b8-ambiguity of Yang\u2013Mills\ngauge theories [9]. Specifically, further extending the Holst approach considering a true\ntopological term in the action [9, 10], the BI parameter becomes the coupling constant in\nfront of such a parity violating term in the action, in analogy with the Pontryagin term of\nYang\u2013Mills gauge theories. In general, it does not affect the classical equations of motion,\neven in the presence of matter [9] (see also [11]), but defines a one-parameter quantization\nambiguity [12], related to the large structure of the SU(2) group [9]. Here we offer an\nalternative interpretation based on a larger gauge group.\nIt has been known for some time that the two ingredients of Einstein\u2013Cartan gravity,\nthe spin connection and the tetrad, can be conveniently repackaged into a single connection\nvalued in the de Sitter, anti-de Sitter, or Poincar\u00e9 Lie algebra depending on the value of the\ncosmological constant[13][14][15][16]. We will review this construction in section II. This\nbegs the question, can gravity be interpreted as a gauge theory of this larger connection?\nWithout introducing new ingredients into the theory, the answer is negative - it can easily\nbe shown that the Einstein-Cartan equations of motion are not symmetric under the action\nof the larger gauge group, but only under the Lorentz subgroup. However, in light of the\npervasive symmetry breaking mechanisms of the Standard Model, it is natural to think that\ngravity may be obtained as the symmetry broken phase of a more fundamental theory with\nexact local de Sitter, anti-de Sitter, or Poincar\u00e9 gauge symmetry. Indeed, there are known\nmechanisms for doing this[14][15], though these models are not without their deficiencies.\nNevertheless, taking this principle seriously, one can ask if there are generic predictions\nthat can be made based solely on the existence of such a theory, and not on the details\ntherein. Recently one of us, AR, has shown that viewing gravity in this way can lead\nto new solutions to the Einstein\u2013Cartan field equations, as there are some sectors of the\nsymmetry reduced theory that retain a remnant of the full symmetry group, namely the\nvacuum solutions[17]. This allowed for the construction of an infinite class of new solutions\nto the field equations, all of which are locally isomorphic to de Sitter space in regions where\nthe metric is non-degenerate, but differing by topological properties. With respect to the\nsymmetries of the more fundamental theory, all these solutions are related by a large de\nSitter gauge transformation \u2013 however, with respect to the reduced gauge symmetries of\nEinstein\u2013Cartan gravity, the solutions are topologically distinct. In this paper, we again\nexploit the large sector of the de Sitter gauge group to argue for the existence of, in the\nde Sitter case, two instanton angles. The instantons in question, are quantum mechanical\ntunneling transitions between the degenerate vacua, which are classically identified with the\n\n\f3\naforementioned generalized class of de Sitter solutions. Upon symmetry breaking, one of the\ninstanton angles can be related to the Immirzi parameter.\nII.\n\nGRAVITY AS AN (A)DS GAUGE THEORY\n\nThere are two main pieces of evidence, one observational and one theoretical, that the\ncurrent formulation of gravity may be the remnant of a more fundamental theory based on\nthe de Sitter group. The first is the observational discovery that the cosmological constant\nis, indeed, non-zero and positive. As a consequence, while the Universe expands and the\nordinary matter content dilutes, it inevitably reaches a vacuum dominated phase that, at\nleast locally, becomes more and more like de Sitter space as time progresses. We are currently\nin such a vacuum dominated era. The second is a theoretical construction of a de Sitter\ninvariant theory of gravity known as the Macdowell-Mansouri mechanism, and its extensions,\nwhich combines the tetrad and the spin connection into a single connection that takes values\nin the de Sitter Lie algebra (we refer the reader to Appendix A for details). This can be easily\nseen by using a Clifford algebra notation, where the spin connection 1-form \u03c9 \u2261 41 \u03b3 [I \u03b3 I] \u03c9IJ\ntakes values in the bivector elements of the algebra, the tetrad, instead, takes values in the\nvector elements e = 21 \u03b3I eI . Since the basis { 12 \u03b3 [I \u03b3 J] , 21 \u03b35 \u03b3 K } is a basis for the de Sitter\nLie algebra, one can now combine the two fields into a single, de Sitter connection denoted\nA = \u03c9 + 1l \u03b35 e, where l is a parameter with the dimension of a length. Its curvature is\nFA = dA + A \u2227 A. The MacDowell\u2013Mansouri action can then be written (explicit wedge\nproducts are dropped and the trace over the Clifford algebra is assumed)\nZ\n1\n\u22c6 FA FA\n(1)\nSM M =\n\u03ba M\nwhere \u03ba is a dimensionless coupling constant and \u22c6 = \u2212i\u03b35 . Expanding the curvature into\nits vector and bivector components, F = R\u03c9 \u2212 l12 e e+ 1l \u03b35 T , where T = D\u03c9 e is the torsion, the\naction now reduces to (taking note that the trace over any odd number of Clifford matrices\nis zero)1 :\nZ\n1\n2\n1\nSM M =\n\u22c6RR \u2212 2 \u22c6 eeR + 4 \u22c6 eeee.\n(2)\n\u03ba M\nl\nl\nq\n3\nand\nthe\nparameter\nl\nwith\nwhere\nIdentifying the coupling constant with \u03ba = \u2212 16\u03c0G\nl2\n\u039b\n\u039b is the cosmological constant, we recognize the resultant action as ordinary Einstein\u2013\nCartan gravity with a cosmological constant and a topological term proportional to the\nEuler characteristic.\nDespite the formal analogy with Yang\u2013Mills gauge theories, the action (2) is fundamentally different. First note that the \"dual\", denoted as \u22c6, is the dual in the internal space to\ndistinguish it from the operator \u2217, which is the dual on the spacetime indices, appearing in\nthe Yang\u2013Mills theories. Furthermore, whereas the kinetic term of Yang\u2013Mills retains the\nfull gauge symmetry of the group it is based on, the operator \u22c6 explicitly breaks the de Sitter\ninvariance of the theory. As a consequence, despite the appearance of a de Sitter symmetric\n1\n\nNote that in this expression, the operator \u22c6 acts like a dual on the internal indices. This implies, for\nexample, that T r(\u22c6(e e) R) = T r(e e(\u22c6R)) = T r(\u22c6e e R). We refer the reader to the Appendix for more\ndetails.\n\n\f4\ntheory, the symmetry is broken at the level of the action, and the MacDowell\u2013Mansouri\nmechanism could be (and often is) written off as simply a convenient way of repackaging\nvariables, with no further significance.\nOn the other hand, there are known mechanisms for constructing an action along the lines\nof the MacDowell\u2013Mansouri action that preserves the full local de Sitter symmetry and a\nnatural, symmetry broken phase[14][15][16][18]. As is typical with symmetry breaking mechanisms, this requires the introduction of new dynamical fields, which dynamically relax to a\nvacuum state effectively breaking the symmetry. However, to our knowledge it is not known\nif these mechanisms are truly dynamical, in the sense that the symmetry broken phase is an\nenergetically, or otherwise, preferred ground state, that the system inevitably tends toward.\nNevertheless, the existence of such quasi-dynamical symmetry breaking mechanisms, driving\nthe initial Spin(4, 1) gauge theory to the Spin(3, 1) Einstein\u2013Cartan gravity, can be seen as\na strong motivation for taking seriously the Spin(4, 1) scenario. In this paper we will take\nthe possibility of a more fundamental de Sitter symmetry seriously, and explore some of the\nconsequences.\nA.\n\nA toy model\n\nBefore discussing the emergence of the Barbero\u2013Immirzi parameter, we present a model\nto illustrate some of the main features of the symmetry breaking mechanism, in particular\nthe emergence of a theta-term. The model is discussed in full detail in [19]. As with the\nStelle-West model, this model is quasi-dynamic in the sense that the order parameter does\nnot, as of yet, have an associated kinetic term and realistic potential to spontaneously break\nthe symmetry. However, the model is natural in the sense that employs familiar elements\nfrom condensed matter systems and the Standard Model of particle physics to break the\nsymmetry through a physically motivated mechanism involving a highly symmetric fermion\ncondensate. For our purposes it will illustrate some of the generic features one should expect\nfrom a physically realistic spontaneous symmetry breaking mechanism.\nWe begin with a multiplet of spinor fields \u03c8i where the index i ranges from one to four and\nsimply labels the spinors in the multiplet. The individual spinors in the multiplet are taken\nto be Dirac spinors, a term which we take in the most primitive sense to mean an element\nof a 4-component complex vector space subject to the inner product h\u03c6|\u03c8iD = \u03c6\u0304\u03c8 = \u03c6\u2020 \u03b3 0 \u03c6.\nAs such they furnish a representation of the universal cover of the conformal group in four\ndimensions (via the action of the Clifford algebra) with the de Sitter and anti-de Sitter\ngroups as natural subgroups.\nThe action we will consider takes the form\nZ\nS = \u03c3\nDD \u03c8\u0304i DD\u03c8i + Smatter\nM\nZ\n= \u2212\u03c3\n\u03c8\u0304i F F \u03c8i + Smatter .\n(3)\nM\n\nWe will leave the matter action undetermined, but we require that the full action is exactly\nsymmetric under de Sitter gauge transformations.\nIt is useful to rewrite the action as follows\nZ\n(4)\nS=\u03c3\nT r(\u03c8i \u03c8\u0304i F F ) + Smatter\nM\n\n\f5\nrecognizing that \u03c8i \u03c8\u0304i is a complex 4 \u00d7 4 matrix.

We will\nshow later that this is a generic feature of symmetry breaking mechanisms of this sort, and\nwe will show how these extra couplings can be interpreted. The key feature of the mechanism\nis the emergence of a parity violating term proportional to the second Chern class of the de\nSitter connection, from which one can extract the Nieh\u2013Yan class, which in turn contains\nthe BI term. Later, we will show how the Nieh\u2013Yan class naturally generalizes the Holst\nterm to matter contribution [9, 11, 12] and how it leads to the Ashtekar\u2013Barbero constraints\nof GR [20\u201323] with fermions.\nIII.\n\nTHE DEGENERATE VACUUM\n\nWe will now argue that the key features of the model described in the previous section\nare generic features that one should expect from any theory with exact local de Sitter\nsymmetry, that has de Sitter space (or a state locally isomorphic to de Sitter space) as a\nground state. Due to the structure of the gauge group, the de Sitter vacuum defined by FA\nis degenerate. The emergence of the parameter \u03b8 can be associated with the property of\nquantum mechanical tunneling between distinguished degenerate vacua of the theory.\nLet us begin with a gauge theory based on the connection A as the connection in a local\npatch of a principle G-bundle, where G = Spin(4, 1), namely the de Sitter group. Take\nthe full set of gauge symmetries to be Spin(4, 1)M \u22ca Dif f4 (M), where Dif f4 (M) is the\ngroup of diffeomorphisms of the base manifold and Spin(4, 1)M is the set of (vertical) gauge\ntransformation of the bundle with base manifold M. In other words, Spin(4, 1)M is the set\nof gauge transformations generated by g : M \u2192 Spin(4, 1). Assume also that the theory\nhas a class of preferred ground states that satisfies FA = 0. We take this theory to define\nthe more fundamental theory, that must reduce to Einstein\u2013Cartan gravity with a positive\ncosmological constant upon some symmetry breaking mechanism sending the gauge group\nfrom Spin(4, 1)M \u22ca Dif f4 (M) to Spin(3, 1)M \u22ca Dif f4 (M), the latter being the gauge group\nof Einstein\u2013Cartan gravity.\nIf the symmetry breaking mechanism is truly dynamical, the symmetry \"broken\" phase\nof the theory will still retain the full symmetry of the original theory, but this symmetry\nwill be realized in a non-obvious, typically non-linear manner. Furthermore, it is common\nthat the realization of a dynamic symmetry breaking mechanism requires the introduction\nof new dynamical fields that serve as order parameters for the mechanism, as in the StelleWest model where the five dimensional vector field serves as the order parameter to break\nthe symmetry. Without direct knowledge of a true dynamical mechanism, the situation\ncan be modeled by an explicit symmetry breaking. In this case, the symmetries of the two\ntheories will be genuinely different. Generically, the existence of homotopically distinct gauge\n\n\f7\ntransformations of the theory with larger symmetry, can imply the existence of degenerate\nvacuum solutions to the symmetry reduced theory. For example, suppose both theories\ncontain solutions of the form FA = 0, taken to be the ground state sector. Consider a gauge\ntransformation g(x) \u2208 Spin(4, 1)M that is not continuously deformable to the identity and\nis not in the subgroup Spin(3, 1)M . Apply this gauge transformation to a flat connection\nA to obtain gA = gA g \u22121 \u2212 dgg \u22121. This connection is still flat since FgA = gFA g \u22121 = 0.\nThis is clearly just a Spin(4, 1) gauge transformation, so with respect to the symmetries of\nthe theory with larger symmetry, these solutions should be considered physically equivalent.\nHowever, with respect to the the symmetries of the reduced theory, these solutions may be\nphysically distinct, since only the flat sector defined by FA = 0 possesses this symmetry,\nand not the full phase space.\nLet us consider two Cauchy slices and the two connections A and gA, defined respectively\non the two slices. These are connected by continuous paths which cannot be a gauge orbit,\neven in the full theory, since the data on the two slices are related by a gauge transformation\nthat is not connected to the identity. Such transitions, between two topologically distinct\nfield configurations are known as instantons. Generically there can be classical solutions\nrepresenting instantons - however, even if there are not, these paths will contribute to the\npath-integral sum. We will now show how this applies to the case at hand. For the purposes\nof this paper, it is sufficient to restrict attention to spacetime configurations that are flat\nin the de Sitter sense (FA = 0) in the asymptotic past and asymptotic future. We stress\nthat this is a pragmatic restriction Ronly, intended to simplify the discussion. In particular,\nthis ensures that integrals such as M FA FA are true topological invariants even when the\nboundary of the manifold is taken to be \u2202M = \u03a3\u2212\u221e \u222a \u03a3\u221e , the spacelike hypersurfaces in the\nasymptotic past and future. One could potentially lift this constraint by weaker boundary\nconditions, or by adding boundary terms to the action, and to the topological integrals (see\nfor example [24]). However, these terms will generically alter the symplectic form. Since\nwe are focusing on a direct relation between this framework and the ordinary canonical\nframework of the Holst action, we choose to work with the stronger asymptotic boundary\nconditions for conceptual clarity.\nTo see this, we first need to characterize the relevant topological properties of the de\nSitter group. We will take the base manifold to have the topology of the de Sitter ground\nstate, namely M = R \u00d7 S3 , so that a typical constant time Cauchy slice has the 3-sphere\ntopology. We now wish to consider the set of topologically distinct gauge transformations of\nthe initial data on a Cauchy slice generated by g : S3 \u2192 Spin(4, 1). Equivalently we could\nrestrict ourselves to time-independent gauge transformations and restrict attention to one\nspatial slice. This procedure was carried out recently by AR, and the set of homotopically\ndistinct gauge transformations (with respect to the third homotopy group) was constructed\nexplicitly. To summarize, the relevant topological properties of the gauge group are contained\nin the maximal compact subgroup, which in this case is Spin(4). The relevant topological\ninformation that we will need is characterized by the third homotopy group of the gauge\ngroup viewed as a manifold, which in our case is given by \u03c03 (Spin(4, 1)) = \u03c03 (Spin(4)) =\n\u03c03 (SU(2) \u00d7 SU(2)) = Z \u2295 Z. Thus, the homotopically distinct gauge transformations are\nm\nlabeled by two integers, and we will denote a class of such generators by g . It is worth\nn\n\nrecalling that de Sitter space satisfies the condition FA = 0 - thus, applying the gauge\ntransformation to A yields an infinite class of flat connections labeled by two integers. More\nm\n\nm\n\nm\n\nmm\n\nn\n\nn\n\nn\n\nn n\n\nspecifically the gauge transformation can be applied explicitly to yield A = g A g \u22121 \u2212d g g \u22121 .\n\n\f8\nIn the full theory these are just gauge transformations, however, in the Einstein\u2013Cartan\nm\nm\ntheory one can proceed to extract the new tetrad, e , and the new metric g which turns out\nn\n\nn\n\nto depend only on the difference q = m \u2212 n. These solutions are physically distinct with\nrespect to Spin(3, 1)M \u22ca Dif f4 (M).\nmi\n\nmf\n\nni\n\nnf\n\nNow, consider two connections obtained in this way, A and A , and pull-back the first\nconnection to a t = \u2212\u221e slice and the second connection to a t = \u221e slice. A continuous\npath connecting the two configurations can easily be constructed. For example suppose f (t)\nis a continuous and differentiable function such that f (\u2212\u221e) = 0, f (\u221e) = 1, and df = 0 at\nt = \u2212\u221e and t = \u221e. A continuous path is given by\n\u0012m\n\u0013\nmi\nmi\nf\n(13)\nA\u2217 = A + f (t) A \u2212 A .\nni\n\nnf\n\nni\n\nThis connection is asymptotically flat in the past and future, but in the interior generically\nthe reduced curvature R\u03c9 \u2212 l12 (e e) and the torsion D\u03c9 e are non-zero. To see this we note\nthat (see [17] for an explicit demonstration of this)\nZ\nmf\nmi\n1\n=\nY\n[\nF\nF\nA (\u2212\u221e)] = \u2206m + \u2206n\n(14)\nA\n(\u221e)]\n\u2212\nY\n[\nCS\nA\nA\nCS\n\u2217\n\u2217\nni\nnf\n8\u03c0 2 M\nwhere \u2206m = mf \u2212 mi and \u2206n = nf \u2212 ni . As mentioned previously, generically this solution\nwill not be a solution to the Einstein\u2013Cartan field equations, nor is it necessarily a solution to\nthe field equations of the Spin(4, 1) theory. However, it will contribute to the path integral\nin a calculation of the quantum mechanical tunneling amplitude between the corresponding\nquantum ground states.\nTo see this, let |\u03c8dS i = |0, 0i be the quantum ground state corresponding to de Sitter\nm\n\nspace. Denote the unitary action of a large gauge transformation on the state by G so\nm\n\nn\n\nthat one can build a tower of states labelled by two integers, |m, ni = G|0, 0i, which are\nn\n\nm\n\nthe quantum analogues of the flat field configurations A. Now consider the physical inner\nn\n\nproduct of two states |mf , nf i and |mi , ni i. Being gauge invariant, the inner product satisfies\nhmf , nf | mi , ni i = hmi + \u2206m, ni + \u2206n | mi , ni i\nmi\n\nmi\n\nni\n\nni\n\n= h\u2206m, \u2206n | G \u22121 G | 0, 0i\n= h\u2206m, \u2206n | 0, 0i\n\n(15)\n\ndemonstrating that the inner product depends only on the change in m and n. The physical\ninner product can be related to the path integral by\nZ\nhmf , nf | mi , ni i = h\u2206m, \u2206n | 0, 0i = [D\u03a6DA]{\u2206m,\u2206n} eiS[A,\u03a6]\n(16)\nwhere \u03a6 represents the auxiliary matter fields of the Spin(4, 1) theory. The measure is restricted to the set of de Sitter connections that are asymptotically flat in the past and future,\nand connect homotopy sectors that differ by \u2206m and \u2206n. A typical path that contributes\n\n\f9\nto the sum in the functional integral is given by (13). Generically this path-integral will be\nnon-zero giving rise to a quantum mechanical tunneling amplitude between the degenerate\nvacua. Since there is no known general principle that selects one |m, ni vacuum state over\nanother, we must turn to superpositions of |m, ni states that are stable against quantum\nmechanical tunneling.2 This is where the \u03b8-angles enter into the picture. A \u03b8\u2013state is constructed to be stable against quantum mechanical tunneling. Since \u03c03 (Spin(4, 1)) = Z \u2295 Z,\nthere is a two-fold large gauge symmetry, giving rise to the two integers |m, ni. Likewise,\nassociated with both large gauge degrees of freedom, there will be independent instanton\nangles, denoted \u03b81 and \u03b82 . A \u03b8 state is a coherent superposition of the |m, ni constructed\n\u2212m\n\nm\n\n\u2212n\n\nn\n\nto be an eigenstate of the unitary large gauge transformation operator G = G\u2020 whose\neigenvalues are related to the \u03b8-angle by\nm\n\nG\u2020 |\u03b81 , \u03b82 i = ei\u03b81 m ei\u03b82 n |\u03b81 , \u03b82 i .\n\n(17)\n\nn\n\nSimilar to the coherent states of quantum optics, which are eigenstates of the annihilation\n1\n\noperator, the state are eigenstates of the analogous lowering operator: defining G\u2191 = G,\n0\n\n0\n\nand G\u2193 = G, we have\nm\n\n1\n\nG\u2020\u2191 |\u03b81 , \u03b82 i\n\nG\u2020\u2193 |\u03b81 , \u03b82 i\n\ni\u03b81\n\n= e |\u03b81 , \u03b82 i and\n\ni\u03b82\n\n= e |\u03b81 , \u03b82 i.

Let us suppose that there are two topological functionals S\u2191 [A, \u03a6] and\n2\n\nIn general, a superposition of states invariant under the large gauge sector of the theory can be easily\nintroduced at the price of modifying the momentum operator, in the canonical formulation of quantum\nmechanics. This is reflected in the Lagrangian in the form of new topological terms that typically violate\nparity. It is worth stressing that in Yang\u2013Mills gauge theories this topological modification can be reabsorbed through a suitable chiral rotation, which produces an analogous term in the fermionic measure,\neventually modifying the mass term. Interestingly enough, in the case that at least one of the fermions\nis massless, we can still argue for the existence of \u03b8-states, but these states will effectively be physically\nequivalent.\n\n\f10\nS\u2193 [A, \u03a6], that yield the respective instanton numbers \u2206m and \u2206n when restricted to a set\nof solutions that tend towards\n\nm+\u2206m\n\nA\n\nn+\u2206n\n\nm\n\nat t = \u221e and A at t = \u2212\u221e.

One such\nfunctional is known, and it was described above: the first topological functional can be\nidentified with the second Chern-class of the de Sitter connection:\nZ\n1\nS\u2191 + S\u2193 = 2\nFA FA\n(22)\n8\u03c0 M\nsince this functional is topological and gives the expected winding number. On the other\nhand, although the normalized three-volume of the throat of the de Sitter solutions can be\nrelated to the integer q [17], at this time we do not know of any four-dimensional topological\ninvariant that can be identified with S\u2191 \u2212S\u2193 . Thus for the remainder of this argument, we will\nset \u03b8e = 0. We would like to stress that this is a pragmatic restriction only: the \u03b8e term may,\nindeed, be physically relevant, and may yield interesting new physical predictions. However,\nwithout knowledge of a closed form for the topological functional S\u2191 \u2212 S\u2193 , we would be stuck\nwith an additional ambiguity. It should also be mentioned that an alternative approach\nwould be to simply restrict attention to the q = m \u2212 n = 0 sectors. This would have the\nadvantage that at the classical level, the induced metric obtained by extracting the tetrad\nm\n\nm\n\nm\n\nm\n\nfrom A, and computing the metric g , is identically de Sitter space for all m (this procedure\nhas been carried out in [17]). Thus, the physical interpretation of the state |\u03b8, q = 0i would\nbe more straightforward. However, there is a technical detail that makes this choice difficult\nto carry out \u2013 the integers q = m \u2212 n and p = m + n are not entirely independent since\nthey must be either both even or both odd. Thus, fixing \u2206q = 0 in the path integral would\nrequire restricting the paths and the measure, {D\u03a6DA}\u2206p, only to sectors where \u2206p is even.\nTo avoid this difficulty, we will work with in the \u03b8e = 0 sector, and simply define the state\n|\u03b8i \u2261 |\u03b81 , \u03b82 i \u03b81 =\u03b82 .\nIn this case, the total inner product becomes\nZ\nR\n\u03b8\nh\u03b8 | \u03b8i = D\u03a6DA e\u2212i 8\u03c02 M FA FA eiS[A,\u03a6]\n(23)\nwhere it is understood that the path integral is over all {\u2206m, \u2206n} sectors.

The additional topological terms do not affect the equations of motion, but they do\ncomplicate the analysis. Specifically, they modify the definition of the momenta conjugated\nto the Ashtekar\u2013Barbero variables only, without affecting the identification of the Barbero\u2013\nImmirzi parameter with the constant coefficient in front of the Nieh\u2013Yan term. So, for the\npurposes of illustration, to begin with let us first consider the limit when the cosmological\nconstant goes to zero. In taking such a limit, one must first decide on what quantities to\nfix. To retain the information contained in the parity violating term, we demand that in\nthe limit that the cosmological constant goes to zero, the ratio of the parity even coupling\nconstant, call it \u03b1+ , and the parity odd coupling constant, \u03b1\u2212 , must be held fixed. This will\nensure that the information about the instanton configurations is preserved in taking the\nlimit. Thus, in taking the limit as \u039b \u2192 0 we will fix the ratio:\n\u03b1+\n(1/\u03ba)\n=\u2212\n.\n\u03b1\u2212\n(\u03b8/8\u03c0 2 )\n\n(27)\n\nIt is this ratio that can be identified with the ordinary Barbero\u2013Immirzi parameter when\nthe cosmological constant is zero.\nTo see this, we rewrite (25) action as follows:\nZ\nZ\nStotal = \u03b1+\n\u22c6 F F + \u03b1\u2212\nF F + SDirac\nM\nM\n\u0015\nZ \u0014\n\u03b1\u2212\nF F + SDirac\n= \u03b1+\n\u22c6F F +\n\u03b1+\nM\n\u0015\n\u0015\nZ \u0014\nZ \u0014\n\u03b1\u2212\n1\n1\nl2\n\u22c6RR +\n\u22c6eeR\u2212 2 \u22c6 eeee\nRR +\n= \u2212\n2k M\n\u03b1+\nk M\n2l\n\u0014\n\u0015\nZ\n1\n\u03b1\u2212\n1\ne e R + T T + SDirac\n(28)\n+\nk M \u03b1+\n2\n\n\f12\n\u0011\nR\u0010\n\u22c6R R + \u03b1\u03b1\u2212+ R R =\nGenerically, the limit l \u2192 \u221e will not converge unless we have\n0. Since this is a topological constraint only, and we have already extracted the relevant\ntopological information from the action, for the purposes of this argument the constraint is\nnot too restrictive. The limit then becomes\n\u0012\n\u0013\u0015\nZ \u0014\n1\n\u03b1\u2212\n1\nStotal =\n\u22c6eeR+\neeR + T T\nk M\n\u03b1+\n2\nZ\n2i\n\u03c8\u0304 \u22c6 e e e D\u03c9 \u03c8 + D\u03c9 \u03c8\u0304 \u22c6 e e e \u03c8\n(29)\n+\n3 M\nThe Barbero\u2013Immirzi parameter can then be viewed as the coupling constant of the topological Nieh\u2013Yan form, T r(2 e e R + T T ) = T r(d(e T )). Although this appears to be distinct\nfrom the ordinary Barbero\u2013Immirzi term, when the canonical analysis is carried out explicitly, the resulting constraints of this more general theory are exactly those of the ordinary\nAshtekar\u2013Barbero canonical formulation of GR [10], as we will demonstrate in Section IV.\nB.\n\nThe anti-de Sitter group\n\nIn the analysis above we focused on the de Sitter group because it is observationally\npreferred. However, the main features of the analysis appear to carry through even when\nthe gauge group is taken to be the anti-de Sitter group Spin(3, 2) with some important\nqualifications. The most important distinction involves the topological structure of the\ngroup and the topology of AdS space itself. The universal cover of Spin(3, 2)/Spin(3, 1) is\nidentified with AdS4 , which has topology R4 . A typical spatial slice will then have spatial\ntopology R3 . Thus, to identify the interesting topological features of Spin(3, 2)M , one can\nadopt the ordinary procedure of adding boundary terms to the action, fixing the gauge at\nspatial infinity, and compactifying the spatial slice to S3 by adding the point at infinity to\nthe topological manifold. The remaining symmetries at spatial infinity will become true\nsymmetries and the boundary terms in the action will be related to conserved quantities in\nthe bulk.\nFollowing this procedure one can then analyze the topological structure of Spin(3, 2)M .\nThe most important distinction is that whereas \u03c03 (Spin(4, 1)) = Z \u2295 Z, for the anti-de\nSitter group we have \u03c03 (Spin(3, 2)) = Z. Furthermore, the generating subgroup of the\ntopologically non-trivial maps g : S3 \u2192 Spin(3, 2) can be identified as living in a rotation\nsubgroup of the full group. This means that one can still carry out the procedure of defining\nthe AdS connection A, transforming it by a large gauge transformation, and extracting the\nnew tetrad \u2013 however, the new connection will be labeled by a single integer, and the metric\nthat one obtains from the extracted tetrad will be identical to ordinary anti-de Sitter space.\nInstanton solutions can be constructed in the same way, however, they will be topological\nsolutions connecting the AdS vacuum at past infinity to the same AdS vacuum\nat future\nR\n1\ninfinity. Nevertheless, the instanton number can still be identified with 8\u03c02 FA FA , so the\n\u03b8-states can be constructed and the remainder of the calculation proceeds analogously to the\nde Sitter case. Again, the Barbero\u2013Immirzi parameter can be identified as a combination of\nNewton's constant, the cosmological constant, and the \u03b8-parameter.\n\n\f13\nIV.\n\nCANONICAL ANALYSIS\n\nThis section is entirely devoted to the canonical formulation of the gravitational theory\nmodified by the Nieh\u2013Yan invariant. The focus will be on identifying the ratio \u03b1+ /\u03b1\u2212\nwith the Barbero\u2013Immirzi parameter. First, we demonstrate that, in fact, the canonical\nanalysis of the modified action containing the Nieh\u2013Yan invariant leads to the Ashtekar\u2013\nBarbero constraints of pure GR. Second, we demonstrate that, in the presence of spinor\nmatter, the symplectic structure of gravity is not affected, while the torsion-torsion term\nmodifies the fermionic symplectic structure being equivalent to a non-minimal coupling\npreviously introduced [11, 25, 26]. The key feature that we wish\nR to highlight, that the\ntwo actions are equivalent at the classical, canonical level if the T T terms in the NiehYan\nformulation are replaced with the appropriate non-minimal coupling terms of the form\nR\n\u03c8\u0304 e e e D\u03c8\u2212D \u03c8\u0304 e e e \u03c8 in the ordinary Holst formulation. Since the Hamiltonian framework\nis the starting point of canonical quantization, the two actions will be equivalent at the\nquantum level as well.\nIn order to be as clear as possible, in this section we reintroduce space-time indexes\n\u03bc, \u03bd, \u03c1 . . . and internal indexes, I, J, K . . . , for Lorentz valued tensors. It will be convenient\nhere to use the external dual \u2217 as opposed to the internal dual \u22c6. The Nieh\u2013Yan modified\naction reads\n\u0015\nZ \u0014\n\u0001\n1\n\u03b1\u2212\nIJ\nIJ\nI\nStotal =\n\u2217 (eI \u2227 eJ ) \u2227 R \u2212\neI \u2227 eJ \u2227 R \u2212 T \u2227 TI\n2k M\n\u03b1+\n\u0014\n\u0015\nZ\n1 IJ\n1 \u03bc\u03bd\u03c1\u03c3\n1\n\u03bc \u03bd\n\u03bc \u03bd\n4\n(4)\nIJ\nI\nJ\nKL\nd x det e e I e J R\u03bc\u03bd +\n\u01eb\ne e R\n\u01eb\nD\u03bc e\u03bd D\u03c1 e\u03c3 (30)\n.\n\u2212\n=\n2k M\n2\u03b3 KL I J \u03bc\u03bd\n4\u03b3\nAs mentioned previously, the focus of this Section is on clarifying the role of the constant\nratio \u03b1+ /\u03b1\u2212 , which, at the end, will be identified with the Barbero\u2013Immirzi parameter, so,\nfor convenience we redefine it as \u03b3 = \u03b1+ /\u03b1\u2212 . Note that the torsion-torsion term has been\nrewritten in terms of the tetrad fields and covariant derivatives, according to the following\nI\nI\ndefinitions: T I = 12 TJK\neJ \u2227 eK with T\u03bc\u03bd\n= D[\u03bc e\u03bd]I . The usual expression of the volume\n4-form, eI \u2227 eJ \u2227 eK \u2227 eL = \u2212\u01ebIJKL det(e) d4 x, with \u01eb0123 = \u2212\u01eb0123 = 1, has been used.\nNow, assuming that the space-time (M, g\u03bc\u03bd ) is globally hyperbolic, then, according to\nGeroch theorem [27], we can define a global time function t in such a way that each surface\nof constant t is a Cauchy surface \u03a33 and the space-time topology is M = R \u00d7 \u03a33 . On\neach surface, the 4-dim metric g\u03bc\u03bd induces a Riemannian metric h\u03bc\u03bd defined by the first\nfundamental form, i.e.\nh\u03bc\u03bd = g\u03bc\u03bd + n\u03bc n\u03bd ,\n(31)\nwhere n\u03bc is the normal vector to \u03a33 . Let t\u03bc = t\u03bc (y) be a vector field in M \u220b y, satisfying\nt\u03bc \u2207\u03bc t = t\u03bc \u2202\u03bc t = 1, or, equivalently, t\u03bc dx\u03bc = dt.3 The \"time flow\" vector field, t\u03bc , generates\na one-parameter group of diffeomorphisms, known as embedding diffeomorphisms, \u03c6t : R \u00d7\n\u03a33 \u2192 M, defined as y(t, x) \u2261 yt (x). This allows us to represent space-time as a oneparameter family of 3-dimensional Cauchy surfaces \u03a33t , obtained by smoothly deforming the\ninitial surface \u03a33 and described by the parametric equations yt\u03bc = yt\u03bc (x), where t denotes\n3\n\nWe remark that neither t nor t\u03bc can be interpreted in terms of physical measurements of time, since\none does not know the metric, which is, in fact, the unknown dynamical field in the Einstein theory of\ngravitation.\n\n\f14\nsurfaces at different \"times\". A general and convenient parametrization of the embedding\ncan be obtained by introducing the normal and tangential components of the deformation\nvector t\u03bc (y) with respect to \u03a33 . Namely, we define\nN \u2261 g\u03bc\u03bd t\u03bc n\u03bd ,\n\nN \u03bc \u2261 h\u03bc\u03bd t\u03bd ,\n\n(32)\n\nrespectively called lapse function and shift vector. As a consequence we have\nt\u03bc (t, x) =\n\n\u2202y \u03bc (t, x)\n\u2202t\n\n= N(t, x) n\u03bc (t, x) + N \u03bc (t, x) .\n\n(33)\n\ny(t,x)=yt (x)\n\nBy acting with a Wigner boost on the local basis, we can rotate the zeroth component of the\nbasis in such a way that it results to be parallel, in each point of \u03a33 , to the normal vector n\u03bc ,\ni.e. n\u03bc = e\u03bc0 . The requirement that this particular choice of the orientation of the local basis\nbe preserved along the evolution fixes the so-called Schwinger, or time gauge; the net result\nbeing that the action will no longer depend on the boost parameters. As a consequence,\nthe local symmetry group is reduced from the initial Spin(3, 1) to Spin(3) \u2243 SU(2), which\nencodes the remnant spatial rotational symmetry. It can be demonstrated that fixing the\ntime gauge into the action does not affect the consistency of the canonical analysis, this\nprocedure being equivalent to a canonical gauge fixing. After fixing to the time gauge, it is\nconvenient to denote internal spatial indices by lower case i, j, k, ... indices. The action (30)\ncan be rewritten as follows:\n\u0014 \u03bc\n\u0012\n\u0013\nZ\nt \u2212 N\u03bc \u03b1\n1 i\n3 N det e\n0i\njk\nS3+1 = dtd x\ne i R\u03bc\u03b1 \u2212\n\u01eb R\nk\nN\n2\u03b3 jk \u03bc\u03b1\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1 ij\n1 \u03b1 \u03b3\n0k\nij\n+ e i e j R\u03b1\u03b3 + \u01eb 0k R\u03b1\u03b3\n2\n\u03b3\n\u0015\n1 \u03bc \u03b1\u03b2\u03b3\n1 \u03bd \u03b1\u03b2\u03b3\ni\ni\n\u2212\nt \u01eb D\u03bc e\u03b1 D\u03b2 e\u03b3 i \u2212\nt \u01eb D\u03b1 e\u03bd D\u03b2 e\u03b3 i\n4\u03b3\n4\u03b3\n\u001a \u03b1\nZ\n\u0003\nei\u0002\n3\n3\n= dtd x det e\nLt Ai\u03b1 \u2212 D\u03b1 (t * \u03c9 i ) + (t * \u03c9 i k )\u03b3K\u03b1k\nk\u03b3\n\u03b3\n\u0002\n\u0001\n\u0003\ne\ni\n\u2212 N \u03b1 i F\u03b1\u03b3\n\u2212 1 + \u03b3 2 \u01ebi jk K\u03b1j K\u03b3k\nk\u03b3\n\u0013\n\u0015\n\u0012\n\u03b3 \u0014\n\u0001 i j\n1 ij\n\u03b3 2 k e\u03b1i e j ij k\n2\nk\n\u01eb k F\u03b1\u03b3 \u2212 2 \u03b3 + 1 K[\u03b1 K\u03b3] \u2212 2 \u03b3 +\n\u01eb k D[\u03b1 K\u03b3]\n\u2212N\n2 k\u03b3 k\u03b3\n\u03b3\n\u001b\n\u0002\n\u0001 k\u0003\neN \u03b1\u03b2\u03b3\ni\ni\n\u01eb D\u03b2 e\u03b3i Lt e\u03b1 + t * \u03c9 k e\u03b1\n,\n(34)\n\u2212\n4\u03b3\nwhere \u01ebijk = \u01eb0ijk , with \u01eb123 = \u01eb123 = 1; t*\u03c9 i = \u2212 21 \u01ebi jk t\u03bc \u03c9\u03bcjk and t*\u03c9 ik = t\u03bc \u03c9\u03bcik .

For the sake of brevity, it is worth distinguishing among the\ncanonical variables those playing the role of Lagrange multipliers, namely the set (N, N \u03b1 , t *\n\u03c9 i , t * \u03c9 i k ); while (Ai\u03b1 , \u0393j\u03b2 , ek\u03b3 ) incorporate the dynamics of the system, which will be limited\nby the appearance of constraints.4\nThe momenta conjugated to the dynamical variables are:\nAi\u03b1 : \u2192 Pi\u03b1 =\n\ne \u03b1\ne ,\nk\u03b3 i\n\nNe \u03b2\u03b1\u03b3\n\u01eb D\u03b1 e\u03b3i ,\n4\u03b3\n\u0393k\u03b3 : \u2192 \u03a0\u03b3i = 0 ,\n\nej\u03b2 : \u2192 \u03c0j\u03b2 = \u2212\n\nand the total Hamiltonian reads:\nZ\n\b\n\u0001\n\u0001\nH = d3 x \u2212 t * \u03c9 i D\u03b1 Pi\u03b1 \u2212 t * \u03c9 i k \u03b3K\u03b1k Pi\u03b1\n\u0002 i\n\u0001\n\u0003\n+ N \u03b1 Pi\u03b3 F\u03b1\u03b3\n\u2212 1 + \u03b3 2 \u01ebi jk K\u03b1j K\u03b3k\nr\n\u0013\n\u0015\n\u0014\n\u0012\n\u0001 i j\n\u03b3 \u03b1 \u03b3 ij k\n1 ij\nN\nk\n2\n\u01eb k D[\u03b1 K\u03b3]\nP P \u01eb k F\u03b1\u03b3 \u2212 2 \u03b3 + 1 K[\u03b1 K\u03b3] \u2212 2 \u03b3 +\n+\n2 kP i j\n\u03b3\n\u0001\n\u2212 t * \u03c9 i k ek\u03b1 \u03c0i\u03b1 + \u03bbi\u03b3 \u03a0\u03b3i ,\n\n(37a)\n(37b)\n(37c)\n\n(38)\n\nwhere \u03bbi\u03b3 is a Lagrange multipliers for the primary constraint (37c). Once defined the\nusual symplectic structure, we can proceed to the calculation of the secondary constraints.\nIn particular, by calculating the Poisson bracket between the total Hamiltonian and the\nmomentum \u03a0\u03b3i , conjugate to the 3-dimensional spin connection, we obtain a non-trivial\nsecondary second class constraint. Without entering in the details, we only stress that this\nsecond class constraint can be solved and the 3-dimensional spin connection can be expressed\nas function of the momentum Pi\u03b1 . In geometrical terms this corresponds to find the solution\nof the spatial components of 3-torsion, which, as is well known, allows one to express the\nspin connection as a function of the triads in time gauge. As an immediate consequence\nthe momentum conjugated to the 3-dimensional spin-connection vanishes strongly, as well\nas the combination D\u03b1 Pi\u03b1 = 0, which is, in fact, a trivial consequence of the compatibility\ncondition. Interestingly enough, the momentum (37b) also vanishes strongly as consequence\n4\n\nThis distinction is not essential at all at this point of the canonical analysis. One can, in fact, go forward\nin the procedure treating all the variables as dynamical and then reducing the system, recognizing the\nLagrange multipliers after having studied the primary constraints and the dynamics described by the total\nHamiltonian. Nevertheless, the mathematical structure of the system is particularly suitable to make this\nkind of distinction at the very beginning, the advantage being that the procedure becomes shorter and\nhopefully more clear.\n\n\f16\nof the solution of the second class constraint, which essentially brings in the information\nabout the vanishing of spatial components of torsion. Now the total Hamiltonian can be\ndrastically simplified. In particular, the dynamics is completely described by the variables Ai\u03b1\nand their conjugate momenta Pi\u03b1 , which have to satisfy a set of seven first class constraints,\nnamely\nGi := \u2202\u03b1 Pi\u03b1 + \u01ebij k Aj\u03b1 Pk\u03b1 \u2248 0 ,\n(39a)\n\u0002 i\n\u0001 i\n\u0003\n\u03b3\n2\nj\nk\nH\u03b1 := Pi F\u03b1\u03b3 \u2212 1 + \u03b3 \u01eb jk K\u03b1 K\u03b3 \u2248 0 ,\n(39b)\nr\n\u0015\n\u0013\n\u0014\n\u0012\n\u0001 i j\n\u03b3 \u03b1 \u03b3 ij k\n1 ij\nk\n\u2248 0 , (39c)\n\u01eb k D[\u03b1 K\u03b3]\nPi Pj \u01eb k F\u03b1\u03b3 \u2212 2 \u03b3 2 + 1 K[\u03b1\nK\u03b3] \u2212 2 \u03b3 +\nH :=\nkP\n\u03b3\nwhere in the first weak equation we have used the strong equation D\u03b1 Pi\u03b1 = 0, in order\nto rewrite the rotational constraint as the typical Gauss constraint of Yang\u2013Mills gauge\ntheories. This set of constraints is equivalent to the following one:\nGi := \u2202\u03b1 Pi\u03b1 + \u01ebij k Aj\u03b1 Pk\u03b1 \u2248 0 ,\nH\u03b1 :=\n\ni\nPi\u03b3 F\u03b1\u03b3\n\nr\n\n(40a)\n\n\u2248 0,\n\n(40b)\n\n\u0001 i ji\n\u03b3 \u03b1 \u03b3 h ij k\nPi Pj \u01eb k F\u03b1\u03b3 \u2212 2 \u03b3 2 + 1 K[\u03b1\nK\u03b3] \u2248 0 ,\n(40c)\nkP\nwhich is the usual set of constraints of the Ashtekar\u2013Barbero canonical formulation of General Relativity.\nSo, the parameter \u03b3 = \u03b1\u03b1\u2212+ appearing in front of the of the Nieh\u2013Yan invariant can be\nidentified with the Barbero\u2013Immirzi ambiguity of Loop Quantum Gravity as claimed above.\nThe naturalness of this identification can be easily motivated also from a different perspective.

The requirement that the bulk term B vanishes provides the\nclassical equations of motion:\nH :=\n\nT I = deI + \u03c9 IJ \u2227 eJ = 0 ,\nJ\n\n\u01ebIJKL e \u2227 R\n\nKL\n\n= 0,\n\n(42a)\n(42b)\n\nwhile the (pre)symplectic structure can be obtained by differentiating the boundary term\nJ, namely\nZ\n\u0010\n\u0011\n1\n\u03b3\nJ =\u2212\neI \u2227 eJ \u2227 \u03b4 \u03c9 IJ \u2212 \u01ebIJKL \u03c9 KL\n2k\u03b3 \u2202M\n2\nZ\n1\nT I \u2227 \u03b4eI .\n(43)\n+\nk\u03b3\nIn particular, on the space of regular solutions of the equations of motion (covariant phase\nspace), the symplectic structure we obtain is\nZ\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u03b3\n1\n\u03b4[1 (eI \u2227 eJ ) \u2227 \u03b42] \u03c9 IJ \u2212 \u01ebIJKL \u03c9 KL\n\u03a9 = \u2212\u03b4J =\nk\u03b3 \u03a3\n2\n\u0015\n\u0014\nZ\n1\n1 IJ\nIJ\nKL\n\u03b4[1 [\u2217 (eI \u2227 eJ )] \u2227 \u03b42] \u03b3\u03c9 + \u01eb KL \u03c9\n,\n(44)\n=\u2212\n2k\u03b3 \u03a3\n2\n\n\f17\nfor any two vectors \u03b41 and \u03b42 tangent to the space of regular solutions. Some general\narguments allows one to demonstrate that, in fact, the space of classical solutions as well as\nthe above symplectic structure are independent of the Barbero\u2013Immirzi parameter, \u03b3. So,\nthe Barbero\u2013Immirzi parameter does not affect the classical dynamics being the coupling\nconstant of a true topological term, namely the Nieh\u2013Yan density; nevertheless, according\nto the arguments presented in the previous Sections, it well affects the quantum dynamics,\nbeing related to the instanton angle, \u03b8.\nThe form of the symplectic structure given above and resulting from the Nieh\u2013Yan modified action is equivalent to the one in [1], with the remarkable difference that now the parallel\nwith the \u03b8-angle of Yang\u2013Mills gauge theories, mentioned in [1] can be completed, providing\nalso an interesting scenario to explain the presence of inequivalent \u03b3-sectors in gravity (see\nalso [9] and [12] to have a complete picture of the role of the Nieh\u2013Yan in relation to the\nBarbero\u2013Immirzi ambiguity from the the canonical General Relativity perspective).\nThe last step is the introduction of fermionic matter, which, as is well known, modifies\nthe structure equation producing a non-vanishing torsion contribution. So, let us consider\nthe following action:\n\u0015\nZ \u0014\n\u0001\n1\n1\nIJ\nIJ\nI\nStotal =\neI \u2227 eJ \u2227 \u22c6R \u2212\neI \u2227 eJ \u2227 R \u2212 T \u2227 TI\n2k M\n\u03b3\nZ\n\u0002\n\u0003\ni\n\u2217eI \u03c8\u0304 \u03b3 I D\u03c8 + (D \u03c8\u0304) \u03b3 I \u03c8 ,\n(45)\n+\n2 M\nand, as we did before, let us split the boundary from the bulk contribution under a general\nvariation of the action.

This nonminimal coupling, originally introduced elsewhere [11, 25, 26], reduces to the left or right\nprojectors respectively when \u03b3 = \u00b1 i, thus allowing one to easily obtain the well known\naction for (anti)self-dual gravity coupled to matter [28]. We stress that, starting from the\nNieh\u2013Yan modified action, the parameter contained in the non-minimal coupling term naturally corresponds to the Barbero\u2013Immirzi parameter. So, in agreement with [29], we claim\nthat the most natural choice for the non-minimal coupling constant on the fermionic sector\nis the Barbero\u2013Immirzi parameter. Moreover, we can say that the most natural starting\npoint is the Nieh\u2013Yan modified action for gravity and minimally coupled fermions, which\nnaturally corresponds to a specific effective non-minimal coupling; whereas any other different choice would spoil the topological interpretation of the Barbero\u2013Immirzi parameter,\npossibly introducing further ambiguities [29].\nV.\n\nSUBTLETIES\n\nIn this section we discuss some subtleties in the construction. The emergence of the NiehYan term is the key ingredient that allows for an identification of the Immirzi parameter\nwith a topological term. On the other hand, in our construction, the Nieh-Yan term did not\ncome alone but came in conjunction with the second Chern-class of the spin connection. This\nterm complicated the analysis. In light of this it may seem natural to isolate the Nieh-Yan\nterm alone. For example, since the mechanism relies on a breaking of Spin(4, 1) symmetry\ndown to Spin(3, 1), it is natural to look for instantons that emerge from group elements in\nthe quotient space Spin(4, 1)/Spin(3, 1). Since the quotient can be identified with de Sitter\nspace itself, It can be checked that \u03c03 (Spin(4, 1)/Spin(3, 1)) = \u03c03 (R \u00d7 S3 ) = Z. It seems\nnatural that corresponding index of a field configuration would be encoded in the difference\nof the second Chern classes of A and \u03c9, which can be identified with Nieh-Yan class:\nZ\nZ\nZ\n1\nFA FA \u2212\nRR = \u2212 2\n(T T + 2 e e R) .\n(49)\nl M\nM\nM\nThis was the viewpoint adopted in [30], where a specific field configuration was given whose\nindex was encoded entirely in the Nieh-Yan functional. Unfortunately, this procedure does\nnot work in general, the precise reasons for which are illuminated in a work in preparation\n[31]. Briefly, the reason why it does not work in general can be traced back to the structure\nof the group Spin(4, 1) viewed as a reductive Cartan algebra (see [32][33] for a review of\nthis construct). Generically, a Lie algebra is said to be reductive if it admits an orthogonal\nsplit g = h \u2295 p where h is a sub algebra, and p is generically just a vector space on which h\nacts . The reductive algebra is, in addition said to be symmetric if there is a grading of the\nalgebra where h are the even elements and p are the odd elements. In the reductive case the\nalgebra has the generic structure\n[h, h] \u2286 h\n\n[h, p] \u2286 p .\n\n(50)\n\nIn addition to this, if the algebra is symmetric, we will have the additional condition\n[p, p] \u2286 h\n\n(51)\n\n\f19\nsince the left hand side, being difference of the product of two odd elements, must be even.\nIn general for an arbitrary reductive algebra, one can construct a generalization of the threedimensional Nieh-Yan functional just as above in (49), where the connection is replaced with\nA = \u03c9 + \u03be. The h part of the curvature FA is the corrected curvature F\u03c9 + 21 [\u03be, \u03be]h , and the\np part of the curvature is the corrected torsion D\u03c9 \u03be + 21 [\u03be, \u03be]p. If the bundles are trivial, the\ngeneralized Nieh-Yan class can be written as a pure boundary term given by\nZ\nZ\nhFA FA \u2212 F\u03c9 F\u03c9 i =\nhD\u03c9 \u03be D\u03c9 \u03be + [\u03be, \u03be]h F\u03c9 + [\u03be, \u03be]p D\u03c9 \u03bei\nM\nM\nZ\n2\n=\n(52)\nh\u03be D\u03c9 \u03be + \u03be \u03be \u03bei\n3\n\u2202M\nwhere h*, *i is an inner product on the algebra with respect to which h and p are orthogonal.\nIn the case when the algebra is symmetric, we have 21 [\u03be, \u03be]p = 0 and the inhomogenous part\nof the Nieh-Yan functional is identically zero:\nZ\nZ\n2\nsymmetric\nh\u03be D\u03c9 \u03be + \u03be \u03be \u03bei\n=\nh\u03be D\u03c9 \u03bei .\n(53)\n3\n\u2202M\n\u2202M\nHowever, it is precisely this inhomogenous term is necessary for the functional to pick up\nthe proper index of the field configuration. To see this, define the three-dimesional NiehYan functional on an arbitrary three-manifold \u03a3, and evaluate it on a fixed connection A.\nSuppose that the connection is flat (and torsion free) connections on \u03a3. There full curvature\nvanishes so FA = 0 and \u03c4 = 0. The winding number of the large gauge transformation is a\nquantity that is independent of the field configuration. However, restricted to the set of flat\nconnections, if the algebra is symmetric we have\nZ\nZ\n2\nh\u03be D\u03c9 \u03bei = 0 .\n(54)\nh\u03be D\u03c9 \u03be + \u03be \u03be \u03bei =\n3\n\u2202M\n\u2202M\nThis holds identically. Since a gauge transformation, large or small, takes flat connection\nto flat connections, the Nieh-Yan functional is identically invariant under a gauge transformations. Thus, the Nieh-Yan functional for symmetric reductive connections does not give\nthe index of the field configuration. Indeed one can check explicitly that for the connection\n(13),\nZ\nZ\nFA FA \u2212\nR R = 0.\n(55)\nM\n\nR\n\nM\n\nOn the other hand the second Chern-class, M FA FA , does give the expected result. Thus,\nwe are forced to use this functional, and to deal with the additional topological terms in the\naction.\nA.\n\nWhat is the role of the Nieh-Yan term?\n\nIn light of the above discussion, it is worth commenting on the specific role of the NiehYan term in this picture. Since the Nieh-Yan term alone does not encode the proper index\nof the gauge field configuration, it may seem superfluous in the construction of the theta\nsectors. Indeed, the reader may have noticed that the relevant index that gives rise to the\nImmirzi parameter upon symmetry reduction is the particular combination p = m + n. For\n\n\f20\nm\n\na group element g \u2208 Spin(4, 1)M given by the specific representation presented in [17], it\nn\n\nm\n\ncan be shown that when q = m \u2212 n = 0 the resulting group element g is in a Spin(3, 1)M\nm\n\nm\n\nsubgroup. This is the reason why the metric g depends only on q, whereas the tetrad\nn\n\ndepends on both p and q. In light of this, it may seem that one could carry out the entire\nconstruction of the theta-sectors using the second Chern-class of the spin connection alone,\nobviating the need for the introduction of the Nieh-Yan class and resulting the Immirzi term.\nWhat role then does the Nieh-Yan term play in this construction?\nThe interpretation that we would like to put forward is that the Nieh-Yan term, and hence\nthe Immirzi parameter, is a vestigial artifact left over from the breaking of the Spin(4, 1)\nsymmetry to Spin(3, 1). To understand this better, we recall that the construction of the\nlarge sector of the Spin(4, 1)M gauge group in [17] relied on the identification of a maximal\ncompact subgroup via a homeomorphism G \u2248 H \u00d7Rn , which can be found for any connected,\nsemi-simple, non-compact Lie group G. The maximal compact subgroup, H, is not unique,\nbut is essentially unique. This means that it is unique only up to conjugation H \u2192 H \u2032 =\ngHg \u22121 for an arbitrary element g \u2208 Spin(4, 1)M . Although the topological content of H \u2032 is\nthen same as H, in general the two groups cannot be identified. For example, consider a\nm\ngroup element g with winding number\nn\n\n1\nw( g ) =\n24\u03c0 2\nn\nm\n\nZ\n\nmm\n\nmm\n\nmm\n\nn n\n\nn n\n\nn n\n\nd g g \u22121 \u2227 d g g \u22121 \u2227 d g g \u22121 = m + n .\nS3\n\n(56)\n\nm\n\nNow conjugate g by an arbitrary identity connected group element g \u2208 Spin(4, 1)M , to\nn\n\nm\n\nm\n\n\u22121\n\ndefine h = g g g . Since g is connected to the identity, the winding number will not change\nn\n\nm\n\nn\n\nm\n\nso that, w( h) = m + n. On the other hand, generically h will not be in the original maximal\nn\nn\ncompact subgroup H.\nThis has the following practical implication. Suppose we are given a gauge field configuration A\u2217 analogous (13) in the sense that the connection restricted to spatial slice at\nt = \u221e is related to the connection restricted to the t = \u2212\u221e spatial slice by a large gauge\nm\ntransformation generated by g . In this case, the index of the field configuration is given by\nm\n\nthe second Chern-class of the spin connection alone because of the identity:\nZ\n1\n2\u2206m =\nFA FA\n8\u03c0 2 M \u2217 \u2217\nZ\nZ\nZ\n1\n1\n1\nR\u03c9 R\u03c9 +\ne\u2217 T\u2217\ne\u2217 T\u2217 + \u2212 2 2\n=\n8\u03c0 2 M \u2217 \u2217 8\u03c0 2 l2 S3\u221e\n8\u03c0 l S3\u2212\u221e\nZ\n1\n=\nR\u03c9 R\u03c9 .\n8\u03c0 2 M \u2217 \u2217\n\n(57)\n\n(58)\n\nm\n\nThe last line follows from the fact that g \u2208 SU(2)M \u2282 Spin(3, 1)M and the torsion and tetrad\nm\n\ntransform tensorially (i.e. homogenously) under Spin(3, 1). On the other hand, just as in\nthe previous paragraph, one can conjugate the curvature by making a gauge transformation\nby an arbitrary identity connected element g \u2208 Spin(4, 1)M to define gA\u2217 = gA\u2217g \u22121 \u2212 dg g \u22121\n\n\f21\nand FgA\u2217 = gFA\u2217 g \u22121. This transformation will not effect the winding number since it is gauge\ninvariant, however, generically such a transformation will mix the even and odd components\nof the curvature, or the reduced curvature\nand the torsion\nR respectively. Thus, after the gauge\nR\ntransformation, one cannot identify M FgA\u2217 FgA\u2217 with M Rg \u03c9\u2217 Rg \u03c9\u2217 since the new connection\ng\nA\u2217 restricted to the spatial slice at t = \u221e is related to the connection gA\u2217 restricted to the\nm\n\nm\n\nm\n\nm\n\nm\n\nm\n\nspatial slice at t = \u2212\u221e by a gauge transformation generated by h = g g g \u22121 , but h will not\nnecessarily reside in the original Spin(3, 1)M subgroup.\nThus, although the Nieh-Yan term alone does not yield the proper index of the gauge\nconfiguration, it is a necessary component of the Spin(4, 1)M topological invariant that does.\nThus, we offer that the Nieh-Yan term should be viewed as a vestigial term left over from\nthe breaking of the gauge group Spin(4, 1)M \u22ca Dif f4 (M) to Spin(3, 1)M \u22ca Dif f4 (M). This\nsuggests that the true meaning and physical consequences of the Immirzi parameter should\nbe properly analyzed in the context of a full de Sitter gauge theory.\nVI.\n\nCONCLUDING REMARKS\n\nLet us now summarize the proposal we have put forward in this article. The goal of\nthe present work is to describe the Immirzi parameter as a one-parameter quantization\nambiguity associated with the topological structure of a gauge theory, in direct analogy with\nthe well known \u03b8-ambiguity of the gauge theories of the standard model. Since the standard\nconstruction begins with the Holst modified action,\nR which is the ordinary Einstein-Cartan\naction with an additional parity violating term \u03b31 e e R that is not by itself topological, the\nfirst step is to reformulate the theory so that the Immirzi parameter becomes the coupling\nconstant of a genuine topological term. We have shown that in the presence of fermions, the\nHolst modification term can always be replaced with a Nieh-Yan term, with an additional\nmodification of the non-minimal coupling of the fermions. The key point is that the NiehYan term is itself topological. A detailed analysis of the canonical theory reveals that the\ntwo formulations are canonically equivalent due to the existence of second class constraints\nthat must be imposed strongly.\nThe next step is identify the presence of the Nieh-Yan term as a quantization ambiguity\nresulting from the topological structure of the gauge theory. Our proposal is to enlarge the\ngauge group from the local Lorentz group Spin(3, 1), to the de Sitter group Spin(4, 1). This\nrelies on a well-established formulation of gravity as a gauge theory based on the de Sitter\ngroup. This construction, and the topology of the new gauge group allows for an infinite class\nof flat connections, with de Sitter space being simply one member of the class of classical\nsolutions. Since these classical solutions are simply reflections of the topological structure\nof the gauge theory, the quantum theory will reflect this structure as well in the form of an\ninfinite class of degenerate \"ground states\". From generic arguments, these states will not\nbe true ground state since they are not stable against quantum mechanical tunneling. The\ntrue ground state will be a coherent superposition of these states, constructed at the cost of\nthe introduction of a new parameter, \u03b8, into the theory. In turn, this parameter\nemerges in\nR\nthe effective action as the coupling constant of a topological term, 8\u03c0\u03b8 2 FA FA , the second\nChern class of the de Sitter connection.\nThe relation with the Immirzi parameter and the Holst term comes from the recognition\nthat the Nieh-Yan class is an integral piece of the second Chern class of the de Sitter\nconnection. This can be seen upon symmetry breaking of the gauge theory from the gauge\n\n\f22\ngroup Spin(4, 1)M to Spin(3, 1)M , which isolates the Nieh-Yan term. The Immirzi parameter\ncan then be identified in terms of the cosmological constant, Newton's constant, and the\n\u03b8-parameter.\nViewed from this perspective, the Immirzi term (now the Nieh-Yan term) can be interpreted as a vestigial term left over from breaking of the symmetry of a larger gauge theory,\nand its presence is a reflection of the topological structure of the larger gauge group. Thus,\na true understanding of the meaning and ramifications of the Immirzi parameter should\ncome from an analysis of a de Sitter gauge theory. Ultimately, the hope is that such an\nanalysis will shed light on the ubiquitous but mysterious nature of the Immirzi parameter\nin canonical quantum gravity.\nVII.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nAR would like to thank Roberto Percacci, Rafael Sorkin, and Laurent Freidel for discussions and comments.

Throughout we are working with a four-dimensional differential, Riemannian manifold\nwith metric signature (\u2212, +, +, +). To facilitate algebraic manipulation we have employed\nan index free Clifford algebra notation in this paper. We adopt the complex 4 \u00d7 4-matrix\nrepresentation of the Clifford algebra defined by \u03b3 I \u03b3 J + \u03b3 J \u03b3 I = 2\u03b7 IJ . The de Sitter Lie\nalgebra is then spanned by the basis elements { 12 \u03b3 [I \u03b3 J] , 12 \u03b35 \u03b3 K } and the anti-de Sitter\nalgebra is spanned by { 21 \u03b3 [I \u03b3 J] , 21 \u03b3 K }. Here \u03b35 = 4!i \u01ebIJKL \u03b3 I \u03b3 J \u03b3 K \u03b3 L = i\u03b3 0 \u03b3 1 \u03b3 2 \u03b3 3 where\n\u01eb0123 = \u2212\u01eb0123 = 1. We will also use the notation \u22c6 = \u2212i\u03b35 to emphasize the interpretation\nof this objection as the duality operator on the so(3, 1) vector spaces. The de Sitter connection A is (locally) a one-form that takes values in spin(4, 1) and we identify components\nby A = \u03c9 + 1l \u03b35 e where \u03c9 = 14 \u03b3[I \u03b3J] \u03c9 IJ is the spin connection and e = 12 \u03b3I eI is the tetrad.\nWe will generically denote the curvature with a subscript to identify the connection, as in\nFA \u2261 dA + A A. However, the symbol R will be reserved for the spin connection so that\nR \u2261 F\u03c9 = d\u03c9 + \u03c9 \u03c9.\nWhen writing integrals to shorten formulas, we adopt the practice of dropping the explicit\nT r(*, *) over the Clifford algebra and dropping explicit wedge products between differential\nforms. The most relevant trace formulas are listed below.
