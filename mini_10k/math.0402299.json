One of the important\nissues is to find analogies \u2013 or to establish the differences \u2013 between lattices in the automorphism groups of locally finite trees and lattices in semisimple Lie groups (i.e. in semisimple\nalgebraic groups over local fields). These questions are particularly relevant when the Lie\ngroups are of rank 1. A fundamental theorem due to G.A. Margulis characterizes arithmetic lattices among lattices in semisimple Lie groups as those which are of infinite index in\ntheir commensurators [Mar91, Chapter IX, Theorem B]. (G.A. Margulis proved this characterization for finitely generated lattices, which excluded non cocompact lattices in rank\n1 semisimple Lie groups over local fields with positive characteristic. A proof for this remaining case was later given by L. Lifschitz [Lif02].) G.A. Margulis also showed that being\nof infinite index in its commensurator already means that the commensurator of the lattice\nis hh essentially ii dense in the semisimple Lie group, and is in fact dense if the Lie group is\nsimply connected (for a precise statement, see [Mar91, Chapter IX, Lemma 2.7]).\nThese results in the Lie group case motivated (among other things) the study of commensurators of tree lattices. In order to fix the ideas, we shall introduce some notation now. Let\nT be a locally finite tree with vertex set V T , and let G := Aut(T ) be its group of automorphisms. Provided with the usual topology (a basis of open neighborhoods of the identity are\nthe fixators of finite subtrees of T ), the group G is locally compact. A T -lattice is by definition a lattice in G, i.e. a discrete subgroup of G of finite covolume. It is standard knowledge\n[BL01, Sections 1.5 and 3.2] that a subgroup \u0393 of G is a latticePin G if and only if all stabilizers \u0393x , x \u2208 V T , are finite, as well as the sum Vol(\u0393 \\\\T ) := x\u2208\u0393\\V T | \u0393x |\u22121 is finite. We\ncall \u0393 a uniform (resp. non-uniform) T -lattice if the quotient \u0393 \\ T is finite (resp. infinite).\n1\n\n\f2\n\nPETER ABRAMENKO AND BERTRAND R\u00c9MY\n\nThe commensurator of \u0393 in G is the group defined as: CommG (\u0393) := {g \u2208 G | \u0393 \u2229 g\u0393g \u22121 has\nfinite index in \u0393 and in g\u0393g \u22121} and will be abbreviated by C(\u0393) in the following. Interesting\nquestions concerning C(\u0393) are the following:\nQuestion 1. Is \u0393 of infinite index in C(\u0393)?\nQuestion 2. Is C(\u0393) (essentially) dense in G?\nAs mentioned above, these two questions are equivalent for lattices in semisimple Lie groups,\nbut it is known that they are not equivalent for tree lattices [BL01, Section 10.3]. So it is not\nquite clear which of the two conditions should be used to define, by analogy, hh arithmetic ii tree\nlattices. Usually one chooses the stronger condition and considers a tree lattice \u0393 as arithmetic if C(\u0393) is dense in G. An important theorem proved by Y. Liu states that all uniform\ntree lattices are arithmetic in the latter sense [Liu94]. Much less is known about commensurators of non-uniform tree lattices. In particular, to the best of our knowledge, only two\nexamples of non-uniform tree lattices with dense commensurators are discussed in the literature, namely the example given in [BM96, Section 8.3] and the Nagao lattice PSL2 (Fp [t\u22121 ])\nwhich is shown in [Moz99] to have a dense commensurator for any prime number p.\nIt is the main objective of the present paper to generalize the two last mentioned examples\nin two directions. Firstly, both examples are lattices of Nagao type in the sense of [BL01,\nChapter 10]. For a tree lattice \u0393 of Nagao type, we have a natural level function l : V T \u2192 N\nwhich is \u0393-invariant (see Definition 11 below), and we set L := {g \u2208 G | l(g.x) = l(x) for\nall x \u2208 V T }. Now the following question is crucial with respect to the examples discussed in\n[BM96] and [Moz99].\nQuestion 3. Is C(\u0393) \u2229 L dense in L?\nIn Section 2 of this paper, we shall give a positive answer to this question for all lattices of\ndirectly split Nagao type, a class of lattices which we shall introduce in Section 1 below. This\nis our:\nTheorem 4. If \u0393 is a tree lattice of directly split Nagao type, then C(\u0393) \u2229 L is dense in L.\nReferring the reader to Section 1 for some technical details concerning lattices of directly split\nNagao type, we just mention that this class of lattices is much larger than the examples discussed in [BM96] and [Moz99]. In particular, we allow arbitrary finite hh root groups ii whereas\nthe root groups in [loc. cit.] are always cyclic. (For the classical Nagao lattice PSL2 (Fq [t\u22121 ])\nthe root groups are isomorphic to the additive group of Fq , hence cyclic if and only if q is a\nprime number.)\nNow if the tree T is not biregular, then one easily checks that L = G (Lemma 16), and hence\na positive answer to Question 3 already means that C(\u0393) is dense in G. If, however, T is\nbiregular (as in the case of the classical Nagao lattice), then we need a second ingredient in\norder to deduce the density of C(\u0393) from Theorem 4. Generalizing a strategy used by Sh.\nMozes in [Moz99], we can show that C(\u0393) is already essentially dense in G in the biregular\ncase if it is not contained in L. More precisely, denoting by G\u25e6 the subgroup (of index at\nmost 2) of G of all type\u2013preserving automorphism of T (preserving the 2\u2013colouring of T ),\nwe obtain:\nTheorem 5. If \u0393 is a T \u2013lattice of directly split Nagao type with biregular T and C(\u0393) is not\ncontained in L, then the closure of C(\u0393) in G contains G\u25e6 .\n\n\fCOMMENSURATORS OF SOME NON-UNIFORM TREE LATTICES AND MOUFANG TWIN TREES\n\n3\n\nIn general it is of course difficult to decide whether C(\u0393) is included in L or not. In the\ncase of \u0393 = PSL2 (Fq [t\u22121 ]), the additional ingredient that Sh. Mozes used was the transitive\naction of C(\u0393) on the set of edges of T . This transitivity property follows here, for\u0001 the\ntruly arithmetic group \u0393, from the fact that its commensurator contains PSL2 Fq (t) , an\nargument which is not available for other lattices of Nagao type. This brings us to our second\nline of generalization.\nA special class of lattices of Nagao type arises from the theory of twin trees as follows.\nLet a locally finite (thick) twin tree (T\u00b1 , \u03b4 \u2217 ) be given which has the Moufang property (for\ndefinitions, see Section 3 below). We remark that the trees T+ and T\u2212 are necessarily\nbiregular. Denote by A the automorphism group of the twin tree (T\u00b1 , \u03b4 \u2217 ) and by \u039b its\nsubgroup generated by all root groups. Fix a vertex of T\u2212 and denote by \u0393 its stabilizer in\n\u039b. Then it is well-known that \u0393 acts on T+ as a non-uniform T+ -lattice with a ray R as\nfundamental domain. Moreover, \u0393 is always a lattice of Nagao type in the sense of [BL01],\nand it is of directly split Nagao type in our sense if it satisfies the following condition (which\nwill also be explained in more detail in Section 3).\nAssumption 6. (Comm) For any prenilpotent pair {a; b} of twin roots of the Moufang twin\ntree (T\u00b1 , \u03b4 \u2217 ), the corresponding root groups Ua and Ub commute.\nIt is not difficult to check that A is contained in the commensurator of the T+ -lattice \u0393\nand that it acts transitively on the set of all (geometric) edges of T . In particular, C(\u0393)\nis not contained in L, and thus Theorem 5 implies (where G\u25e6 denotes the group of all\ntype\u2013preserving automorphisms of T+ ):\nTheorem 7. If the thick locally finite Moufang twin tree (T\u00b1 , \u03b4 \u2217 ) satisfies (Comm) and \u0393\nis the T+ -lattice described above, then the closure of C(\u0393) contains G\u25e6 . Therefore C(\u0393) is\ndense in G if T+ is not regular and also, in the regular case, if A contains an automorphism\ninterchanging the types of vertices.\nFirst examples for groups \u039b and \u0393 satisfying (Comm) come from rank 2 Kac-Moody groups\n\u22121\nover finite fields (see 3.4). As a special (affine) case we obtain \u039b = PSL\n\u0012 2 (Fq\u0013[t, t ]) and \u0393 =\nt 0\nPSL2 (Fq [t\u22121 ]) for any prime power q. In the latter case, the matrix\n\u2208 PGL2 (Fq [t])\n0 1\nprovides an element of A interchanging the vertex types: it acts on the tree as a hyperbolic\ntranslation, and its translation length is the length of a single edge. The construction of\nmore exotic examples is sketched in Example 69. As a very special case, we consider trees\nof constant degree equal to 7. For a non-uniform tree-lattice \u0393 naturally defined in terms\nof twinnings, the density of the commensurator holds, at least in the index 2 subgroup G\u25e6 .\nNote that in this case the full automorphism group G is hh as big as ii in the case considered\nby Sh. Mozes, in the sense\u0001 that the tree of valency 7 is hh as homogeneous as ii a Bruhat-Tits\ntree of some PSL2 Fp ((t)) . Nevertheless, the case is new at least because it can easily be\nproved that the lattice itself cannot be linear over a field.\nWe close this introduction by an open question relevant to a higher-dimensional generalization of the above results.\nQuestion 8. Let \u2206\u00b1 be a locally finite thick Moufang twin building whose apartments are\nright-angled tilings of the hyperbolic plane. Does the non-uniform lattice naturally defined as\na negative chamber stabilizer have a dense commensurator in Aut(\u2206+ )?\n\n\f4\n\nPETER ABRAMENKO AND BERTRAND R\u00c9MY\n\nWe focus on the case of right-angled Fuchsian buildings because the local product structure\nof the links at vertices implies the existence of many symmetries for this class of buildings.\nTherefore the corresponding full automorphism groups are big topological groups. Recent\nresults by F. Haglund on commensurators of some uniform lattices for hyperbolic buildings\n[Hag03] are analogous to Y. Liu's theorem for trees (and might be used as such). Note that\nconcrete examples of right-angled Fuchsian buildings admitting a twinning are available\n[RR02, Theorem 4.E.2].\nThis paper is organized as follows. Section 1 deals with lattices of Nagao type as introduced\nby H. Bass and A. Lubotzky. The subclass of tree-lattices of directly split Nagao type is\nintroduced (1.2) and the condition defining it is characterized in terms of actions on some\nhoroballs (1.3). Section 2 proves the main density result (Theorem 4), following the ideas\npresented in [BM96, Section 8.3]. The main change with respect to [BM96] and [Moz99] is\nthe replacement of local data by purely group-theoretic considerations (2.3). Section 3 recalls\nsome facts about Moufang twin trees, and then describes the intersection of this theory with\nthat of tree-lattices of Nagao type. This shows in particular that the class of non-uniform\ntree-lattices to which Theorem 5 applies is quite wide (3.4).\nWe thank Sh. Mozes for helpful discussions on Example 69 and are very grateful to the organizers of the conference hh Geometric Group Theory ii (Guwahati, Assam \u2013 India, December\n2002) organized by the Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati and the Indian Statistical\nInstitute (supported by the National Board of Higher Mathematics).

We define the integers k := [\u03930 : H0 ], q0 := k \u22121,\nq1 := [\u03931 : H0 ] and qi := [\u0393i : \u0393i\u22121 ] for i \u2265 2, and we require that qi \u2265 2 for all i \u2265 0. Now we\n\n\fCOMMENSURATORS OF SOME NON-UNIFORM TREE LATTICES AND MOUFANG TWIN TREES\n\n5\n\nattach H0 to the edge {x0 , x1 } of R and \u0393i to {xi , xi+1 } for all i > 0. We have thus defined\na graph of groups, where the graph is the ray R.\n1.1. Levels, degrees and a first density result. Denote by \u0393 the fundamental group\nof this graph of groups and by T the canonical tree provided by Bass-Serre theory [Ser77,\nI.5.1]: \u0393 acts on T with R as a fundamental domain. For any i \u2265 0, we identify \u0393i with the\nvertex stabilizer Stab\u0393 (xi ) and H0 = \u03930 \u2229 \u03931 with the edge stabilizer Stab\u0393 ({x0 , x1 }).\nDefinition 11. Any vertex x \u2208 V T lies in a \u0393-orbit \u0393.xi for precisely one i \u2265 0; we call i the\nlevel of x and denote it by l(x) = i. We set G := Aut(T ) and L := {g \u2208 G | l(g.x) = l(x)\nfor all x \u2208 V T }.\nThe kernel of the canonical homomorphism \u0393 \u2192 G is a (finite) subgroup of H0 , and by a\nslight abuse of notation, we shall denote the image of \u0393 in G again by \u0393. Therefore \u0393 is a\ndiscrete subgroup of G, and it is of\nalso a subgroup of L. Our assumption qi \u2265 2 for all\nPcourse \u22121\ni \u2265 0 implies that Vol(\u0393 \\\\T ) = \u221e\n|\u0393\n|\nis finite. Hence \u0393 is an (obviously non-uniform)\ni\ni=0\nT -lattice, called a lattice of Nagao type in [BL01, Chapter 10]. Since R is a fundamental\ndomain for the action of \u0393 on T , we immediately obtain the following two facts.\nFact 12. Each vertex x \u2208 V T of level 0 has precisely k = q0 + 1 neighbors, and all of them\nare of level 1. In particular, the degree (or valency) of x is deg(x) = k.\n\u0003\nFact 13. Each vertex x \u2208 V T with l(x) = i > 0 has precisely 1 neighbor of level i + 1 and qi\nneighbors of level i \u2212 1. In particular, deg(x) = qi + 1.\n\u0003\nFact 13 immediately implies the following two statements.\nFact 14. If {yj }j\u22650 \u2282 V T is a geodesic ray in T with l(y0 ) > l(y1 ), then for any j \u2264 l(y0 ),\nwe have: l(yj ) = l(y0) \u2212 j.\n\u0003\nFact 15. If y \u2208 V T has level i > 0, then there is a unique (infinite) ray R(y) = (y0 , y1 , * * * )\nstarting in y = y0 such that l(yj ) = i + j for all j \u2265 0. The ray R(y) will be referred to as\nthe level-increasing ray from x.\n\u0003\nIt is well-known that either T is biregular (i.e. deg(x) = deg(y) for any two vertices x, y \u2208 V T\nat even distance from each other) or G \\ T = R [BL01, Section 10.1]. However, we shall give\na short elementary argument for this (in fact for a slightly more general) statement here,\nalso because we shall later need the remark following this lemma.\nLemma 16. If F is a subgroup of G which contains \u0393 and is not included in L, then\nF.x0 = F.x2m and F.x1 = F.x2m+1 for all integers m \u2265 0. Hence in this case T has to be\nbiregular, and F acts transitively on vertices of the same type (i.e. at even distance from\neach other) and on the set ET of (geometric) edges of T .\nProof. Since for any x \u2208 V T , l(x) is equal to the distance of x from the orbit \u0393.x0 , F\nacts level-preservingly on T if it stabilizes \u0393.x0 . Since F is not included in L, there is an\nn > 0 with F.x0 = F.xn . We choose n > 0 minimal with this property. If n = 1, we\ninductively get F.xr = F.xr\u22121 = F.x0 for all r \u2208 N. If n = 2, then inductively F.x3 = F.x1 ,\nF.x4 = F.x0 (= F.x2 ), F.x5 = F.x1 and so on.\nNow assume that n > 2. Since F.xn\u22121 = F.x1 , we can choose a g \u2208 F with g.xn\u22121 = x1 . Since\ng.xn 6= x2 (otherwise F.x2 = F.xn = F.x0 , contradicting the minimality of n), l(g.xn ) = 0 by\n\n\f6\n\nPETER ABRAMENKO AND BERTRAND R\u00c9MY\n\nFact 13. Now x1 has q1 \u2265 2 neighbors of level 0, and \u03931 acts transitively on them. Hence we\ncan choose \u03b31 \u2208 \u03931 such that \u03b31 .(g.xn ) 6= g.xn . Hence f := g \u22121\u03b31 g is in Fxn\u22121 and f.xn 6= xn .\nTherefore \u0393n\u22121 f.xn contains xn\u22122 , and thus F.xn\u22122 = F.xn = F.x0 . However, this again\ncontradicts the minimality of n, and so n > 2 is impossible.\nThis proves the first claim, which immediately shows that F acts transitively on vertices of\nthe same type. In particular, for any edge e \u2208 ET , there is an f \u2208 F such that x0 \u2208 f.e, and\nthen there is a \u03b30 \u2208 \u03930 such that (\u03b30 .f ).e = {x0 , x1 }. Hence F acts transitively on ET . \u0003\nRemark 17. It is not needed in the above argument that R is infinite. So if we have the\nsame set-up as above, only with a finite path R\u2032 instead of R, and if T \u2032 and G\u2032 are defined\nsimilarly, then also T \u2032 has to be biregular or else G\u2032 \\T \u2032 = R\u2032 .\nLemma 18. Any level-preserving isomorphism \u03c8 : T1 \u2192 T2 between two subtrees T1 and T2\nof T extends to an element of L.\nProof. By Zorn's lemma it suffices to show that \u03c8 can always be properly and levelpreservingly extended if T1 6= T . That this is in fact true can readily be checked by using\nthe Facts 12 and 13 above.\n\u0003\nRemark 19. This lemma in particular shows that the group L is non-discrete and uncountable.\nThe elementary statements which we deduced above have an interesting consequence if we\ncombine them with an idea presented in the last paragraph of Mozes' paper [Moz99]. Recall\nthat G\u25e6 denotes the group of type-preserving automorphisms of T .\nProposition 20. If F is a subgroup of G properly containing L (so that T must be biregular),\nthen the closure of F in G contains G\u25e6 .\nProof. We have to show that any type-preserving isomorphism \u03c6 : S1 \u2192 S2 between two\nfinite subtrees S1 and S2 of T can be extended to an element of F . Without loss of generality,\nwe may assume that S1 = Bs (z1 ), S2 = Bs (z2 ) are two balls of radius s \u2208 N with centers z1\nand z2 which are of the same type. Let v1 be a terminal vertex in S1 and set v2 = \u03c6(v1 ). So\nalso v1 and v2 are of the same type. Let uj (j = 1, 2) be the unique neighbor of vj in Sj .\nChoose a vertex xn \u2208 R of the same type as v1 and v2 with n \u2265 2s. By Lemma 16, there\nexist elements fj \u2208 F satisfying fj .vj = xn and fj .uj = xn\u22121 for j = 1, 2. Set Tj := fj (Sj ) for\nj = 1, 2, and consider the isomorphism \u03c8 := f2 |S2 \u03c6f1 \u22121 |T1 : T1 \u2192 T2 . Note that \u03c8 fixes xn\nand xn\u22121 by construction. So Fact 14 together with n \u2265 2s implies that \u03c8 is automatically\nlevel-preserving. Hence by Lemma 18, there exists a g \u2208 L satisfying g |T1 = \u03c8. Therefore\nthe element f := f2 \u22121 gf1 \u2208 F extends \u03c6.\n\u0003\n1.2. Lattices of directly split Nagao type. Recall that we want to investigate the commensurator C(\u0393) = {g \u2208 G | \u0393 \u2229 g\u0393g \u22121 has finite index in \u0393 and in g\u0393g \u22121}. In the present\ngenerality, we even cannot exclude the possibility that C(\u0393) = \u0393 (for such an example, see\n[BL01, Section 10.5]). Therefore we have to consider a restricted class of lattices of Nagao\ntype. Motivated by and generalizing the discussion in [BM96, Section 8.3], we choose the\nfollowing one.\nDefinition 21. We say that the above introduced tree lattice \u0393 is of directly split Nagao\ntype if there exist, for all j > 0, H0 -invariant subgroups Uj \u2264 \u0393j , called root groups , such\nthat \u0393i = H0 \u22c9 (U1 \u00d7 U2 \u00d7 . . . \u00d7 Ui ) for all i > 0.\n\n\fCOMMENSURATORS OF SOME NON-UNIFORM TREE LATTICES AND MOUFANG TWIN TREES\n\n7\n\nRemarks 22. 1. hh Directly split ii above refers to the direct products U1 \u00d7 U2 \u00d7 . . . \u00d7 Ui . In\nview of this terminology one would perhaps expect that also the product with H0 is direct.\nHowever, this would be too restrictive; it would even exclude the classical Nagao lattice\nPSL2 (Fq [t\u22121 ]).\n2. The terminology hh root group ii is motivated by building theory (here: twin tree theory)\nand will be explained in Section 3.\n3. If H0 = {1}, our lattices of directly split Nagao type are the same as the product groupings associated to Nagao rays in [BL01, Section 10.6].\n4. We stress again that our root groups Ui can be completely arbitrary non-trivial finite\ngroups.\n5. It would be desirable, especially in view of Moufang twin trees which do not satisfy the\nCondition (Comm), to obtain results as deduced below for splittings \u0393i = H0 \u22c9 (U1 * * * Ui )\nwhich are not necessarily direct. However, our method really requires that the different root\ngroups commute. We shall give a geometric characterization of this algebraic property in\nLemma 30 below.\nFor the rest of this paper, we shall assume that our lattices are of directly split Nagao type.\nWe start by collecting a few elementary statements, the first two of which are obvious.\nFact 23. We have: \u03931 = H0 \u22c9 U1 and \u0393i = \u0393i\u22121 \u22c9 Ui for any i \u2265 2. In particular, | Ui |= qi \u2265 2\nfor any i \u2265 1.\n\u0003\nFact 24. For any i > 0, the group Ui acts simply transitively (i.e. regularly) on the set of\nneighbors of xi which are different from xi+1 .\n\u0003\nThis can easily be generalized as follows.\nLemma 25. For any two integers i and j with 0 < i \u2264 j, the group Ui,j := Ui \u00d7 Ui+1 . . . \u00d7 Uj\nacts simply transitively on Mi,j := {x \u2208 V T | l(x) = i \u2212 1 and dist(x, xj ) = j \u2212 i + 1}, where\ndist(x, xj ) denotes the distance between x and xj in T .\nProof. The fact that Ui,j acts transitively on Mi,j immediately follows from Fact 24 by\ninduction on j \u2212 i. Now assume that an element u = uj . . .ui \u2208 Ui,j fixes xi\u22121 . Since\nUi,j \u2264 \u0393j , u has to fix xl for all i \u2212 1 \u2264 l \u2264 j. In particular, xj\u22121 = u.xj\u22121 = uj .xj\u22121 , which\nimplies uj = 1, again by Fact 24. Going on this way, we get uj = uj\u22121 = . . . = ui = 1.\n\u0003\n1.3. Horoballs and horospheres. Recall that to any end \u01eb of the tree T , we can associate\nhorospheres and horoballs centered at \u01eb, see for instance [BL01, Section 9.2]. In the present\npaper, only certain horospheres and horoballs, defined by vertices of positive level, will play\na role.\nDefinition 26. Let x be a vertex of level l(x) > 0, and let \u01ebx be the end of T defined by the\nlevel-increasing ray from x (see Fact 15).\n(a) We denote by HS(x) the horosphere centered at \u01ebx which contains x.\n(b) We denote by HB(x) the horoball centered at \u01ebx which has HS(x) as its boundary, i.e.\nas its set of terminal vertices.\nRemark 27. It is easy to see that the horoball HB(x) is the connected component of x in\nthe forest spanned by all vertices of level \u2265 l(x), and that the horosphere HS(x) is the set\nof vertices of level l(x) in HB(x).\n\n\f8\n\nPETER ABRAMENKO AND BERTRAND R\u00c9MY\n\nThe following statement is an immediate consequence of Lemma 25 and the above definition.\nFact 28. For any integer i > 0, the subgroup Wi+1 := hUj | j \u2265 i + 1i of \u0393 acts simply\ntransitively on the horosphere HS(xi ).\n\u0003\nRemark 29. As opposed to Lemma 30 below, this fact remains true in a more general\ncontext (for instance for general Moufang twin trees), where the products U1 * * *Ui are not\nrequired to be direct.\nWe close this section by stating a geometric consequence of the directness of these products\nwhich will play an important role in the next section.\nLemma 30. For any i > 0, the group Ui fixes the horoball HB(xi ) pointwise.\nProof. It suffices to show that Ui acts trivially on HS(xi ). So take an arbitrary vertex\nx \u2208 HS(xi ), and let w be the unique element in Wi+1 satisfying x = w.xi (Fact 28). Now\nsince Ui commutes with Uj for all j > i, it also commutes with Wi+1 . Therefore ui .x =\nui .(w.xi ) = w.(ui .xi ) = w.xi = x for all ui \u2208 Ui .\n\u0003\nPicture 31.\n\nlength j \u2212 i + 1\n\nUi+1\n\nUi\n\nxj\nxi\u22121\n\nxi\n\nxi+1\n\nxj\u22121\n\n2. Proof of the main density theorem\nWe are now going to investigate the commensurator C(\u0393), where \u0393 is a T -lattice of directly\nsplit Nagao type as introduced in Section 1. Let us first of all mention that Question 1\nformulated in the introduction has a positive answer in this case. In fact, according to\n[BL01, Section 10.1], \u0393 is already of infinite index in NG (\u0393), its normalizer in G. In this\nsection, it is our goal to show that C(\u0393) \u2229 L is dense in L, which is the major step towards\nanswering Question 2. Our strategy will be an appropriate adaptation (using more group\ntheoretic constructions instead of hh local data ii ) of the method developed in [BM96, Section\n8.3]. In particular, we shall also prove an extension result for commensurators of certain\nuniform tree lattices for subtrees of T with bounded level function (see Proposition 54) and\nthen apply Liu's theorem ([Liu94]).\n\n\fCOMMENSURATORS OF SOME NON-UNIFORM TREE LATTICES AND MOUFANG TWIN TREES\n\n9\n\nAs in [Moz99], it will be technically convenient to work with a certain finite index subgroup\n\u2206 of \u0393 (so that of course C(\u2206) = C(\u0393)) instead of \u0393 itself. In the case of the classical\nNagao lattice PSL2 (Fq [t\u22121 ]), Sh. Mozes used the first congruence subgroup. In the theory\nof Kac-Moody groups, one would analogously choose \u2206 to be the hh unipotent radical ii of \u0393,\nwhere \u0393 is considered as a parabolic subgroup of a Kac-Moody group over a finite field. In\nthe next subsection we shall define \u2206 in terms of the subgroups Ui introduced in Definition\n21.\n2.1. The group \u2206 and its action on the tree and on horoballs. We keep the notations\nintroduced in Section 1 and define further\nL subgroups of the T -lattice \u0393 of directly split Nagao\ntype. First, we call V := hUi | i > 0i = i>0 Ui the direct sum of the groups Ui when i ranges\nover all the positive integers i. We fix a system {\u03b31 := 1; \u03b32 ; * * * ; \u03b3k } of representatives of\nthe cosets in \u03930 /H0 . For i > 0 and 1 \u2264 s \u2264 k, we also set:\nUi,s := \u03b3s Ui \u03b3s \u22121\n\nand\n\nVs := hUj , s | j > 0i = \u03b3s V \u03b3s \u22121 ,\n\nso that V1 = V , and we finally define \u2206 := hVs | 1 \u2264 s \u2264 ki.\nLemma 32. The group \u2206 is the normal closure of V in \u0393, and we have: \u0393 = \u03930 \u22c9 \u2206.\nProof. Recall that \u0393 = h\u03930 \u222a V i and that H0 normalizes V . This implies \u0393 = \u03930 \u2206 (since\nV \u03930 \u2206 = \u03930 \u2206), and hence \u2206 is normal in \u0393.\nThe definition of \u0393 as the fundamental group of a ray of groups implies that \u0393 is an amalgam\nof the form \u0393 = \u03930 \u2217H0 H0 V . Now the normal form for amalgams (as stated for instance in\n[Ser77, I.1.2]) shows that no product of the form \u03b3j1 v1 \u03b3j1 \u22121 \u03b3j2 v2 \u03b3j2 \u22121 . . .\u03b3jl vl \u03b3jl \u22121 with l \u2208 N,\nv1 , . . ., vl \u2208 V \\ {1}, 1 \u2264 jr \u2264 k for all r \u2264 l and jr 6= jr+1 (hence \u03b3jr \u22121 \u03b3jr+1 6\u2208 H0 ) for all\nr < k is an element of \u03930 . Hence \u03930 \u2229 \u2206 = {1}.\n\u0003\nThe same normal form argument also shows that \u2206 = V1 \u2217 V2 \u2217 ... \u2217 Vk .\nLemma 33. For any positive integer i > 0, the stabilizer Stab\u2206 (xi ) is equal to U1 \u00d7U2 \u00d7...\u00d7Ui\nand acts trivially on HB(xi ).\nProof. Since H0 \u2229 \u2206 =\u0001 {1} by the previous lemma, we obtain Stab\u2206 (xi ) = \u0393i \u2229 \u2206 =\nH0 \u22c9 (U1 \u00d7 U2 \u00d7 ... \u00d7 Ui ) \u2229 \u2206 = U1 \u00d7 U2 \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 Ui . The second assertion now follows from\nLemma 30.\n\u0003\nRemark 34. The triviality of the Stab\u2206 (xi )-action on HB(xi ) is the main reason why we\nwork with \u2206 instead of \u0393: we do not have the same property for \u0393i since H0 usually acts\nnon-trivially on HB(xi ).\nLemma 35. The subtree F := \u03930 .R is a fundamental domain for the \u2206-action on T .\nProof. We have: \u2206.F = (\u2206.\u03930 ).R = \u0393.R = T . Now assume that there are \u03b4 \u2208 \u2206 and\ng, h \u2208 \u03930 and i, j \u2265 0 such that \u03b4.(g.xi ) = h.xj =: x. Then first of all i = j = l(x). Secondly,\nwe may and shall assume i > 0 (otherwise \u03b4 = 1 by Lemma 32). So h\u22121 \u03b4g is in \u0393i \u2286 \u2206H0 .\nSince h\u22121 \u03b4h \u2208 \u2206, we conclude that h\u22121 g is also in \u2206H0 . However, \u03930 \u2229\u2206.H0 = H0 by Lemma\n32, so that h\u22121 g \u2208 H0 . Therefore: g.xi = h.xi = h.xj .\n\u0003\nThis lemma shows in particular that \u2206 acts simply transitively on the set of all vertices of\nlevel 0. Using again the coset representatives {\u03b31 := 1; \u03b32 ; * * * ; \u03b3k } for \u03930 /H0 , we see that\n\n\f10\n\nPETER ABRAMENKO AND BERTRAND R\u00c9MY\n\nF is the union of the k rays Rs := \u03b3s .R with 1 \u2264 s \u2264 k. We number the vertices of Rs by\nxi,s := \u03b3s .xi for all i \u2265 0 (so x0,s = x0 for all s and xi,1 = xi for all i).\nClaim 36. For any 1 \u2264 s \u2264 k and i > 0, we have:\n(i) The group hUj,s | j > ii acts simply transitively on HS(xi,s ).\n(ii) The stabilizer Stab\u2206 (xi,s ) is equal to U1,s \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 Ui,s and acts trivially on HB(xi,s ).\nProof. The first statement follows directly from Fact 28, and the second from Stab\u2206 (xi,s ) =\n\u03b3s Stab\u2206 (xi )\u03b3s\u22121 (here we use that \u2206 is normal in \u0393) and Lemma 33.\n\u0003\nLemma 37. For any vertex x of level > 0, we have:\n(i) the group Stab\u2206 (x) acts trivially on HB(x);\n(ii) if \u03b4, \u03b4 \u2032 are two elements in \u2206 with \u03b4.x = \u03b4 \u2032 .x, then \u03b4 |HB(x) = \u03b4 \u2032 |HB(x) .\nProof. (ii) is a straightforward consequence of (i), and (i) follows from combining Claim 36\nand Lemma 35.\n\u0003\nGiven x \u2208 V T with l(x) > 0, we can now label the elements in HS(x) by elements of \u2206.\nDefinition 38.\n(a) For x = xi,s \u2208 F with 1 \u2264 s \u2264 k and i > 0 and for any y \u2208 HS(x), we\ndefine \u03b4x,y to be the unique element in hUj,s | j > ii satisfying \u03b4x,y .x = y (see Claim\n36).\n(b) For arbitrary x \u2208 V T with l(x) > 0 and y \u2208 HS(x), we choose \u03b4 \u2208 \u2206 such that \u03b4.x \u2208 F\nand set \u03b4x,y := \u03b4 \u22121 \u03b4\u03b4(x),\u03b4(y) \u03b4.\nThe definition in point (b) above makes sense thanks to:\nClaim 39. The above introduced element \u03b4x,y is well-defined.\nProof. Assume that also \u03b4 \u2032 .x \u2208 F for some \u03b4 \u2032 \u2208 \u2206 and set: z := \u03b4 \u2032 .x = xi,s = \u03b4.x (see\nLemma 35). Then \u03b4 \u2032\u2032 := \u03b4 \u2032 \u03b4 \u22121 \u2208 Stab\u2206 (z) = U1,s \u00d7 ... \u00d7 Ui,s . So firstly, \u03b4 \u2032\u2032 acts trivially\non HS(z) = HS(\u03b4.x) = \u03b4.HS(x) by Lemma 37, hence \u03b4 \u2032 .y = \u03b4 \u2032\u2032 .(\u03b4.y) = \u03b4.y; and secondly\n\u03b4 \u2032\u2032 commutes with hUj,s | j > ii, in particular with \u03b4z,\u03b4(y) . (Here we use again that \u0393 is of\ndirectly split type.) Therefore \u03b4 \u2032\u22121 \u03b4\u03b4\u2032 (x),\u03b4\u2032 (y) \u03b4 \u2032 = \u03b4 \u22121 \u03b4 \u2032\u2032\u22121 \u03b4z,\u03b4(y) \u03b4 \u2032\u2032 \u03b4 = \u03b4 \u22121 \u03b4\u03b4(x),\u03b4(y) \u03b4.\n\u0003\nHaving established this, it is easy to check the following calculation rules:\nLemma 40. For x \u2208 V T with l(x) > 0 and y \u2208 HS(x), we have:\n(i) \u03b4x,y is in \u2206 and \u03b4x,y .x = y;\n(ii) h\u03b4x,y h\u22121 = \u03b4h(x),h(y) for all h \u2208 \u2206;\n(iii) \u03b4y,x = \u03b4x,y \u22121 ;\n(iv) \u03b4y,z \u03b4x,y = \u03b4x,z for all z \u2208 HS(x).\nProof. (i) is clear by definition. To prove (ii), we note that if \u03b4 \u2208 \u2206 is such that \u03b4.x \u2208 F , then\nwe can choose \u03b4h\u22121 \u2208 \u2206 in the definition of \u03b4h(x),h(y) in order to have (\u03b4h\u22121 ).(h.x) = \u03b4.x \u2208 F .\nTherefore, applying part (b) of Definition 38, we obtain: \u03b4h(x),h(y) = (\u03b4h\u22121 )\u22121 \u03b4\u03b4(x),\u03b4(y) (\u03b4h\u22121 ) =\nh\u03b4x,y h\u22121 .\nAccording to (ii), it is enough to prove (iii) and (iv) for x \u2208 F . So assume x = xi,s with\ni > 0 and 1 \u2264 s \u2264 k. Set \u03b4 := \u03b4x,y \u22121 , and observe that this is an element of hUj,s | j > ii\nsending y to x \u2208 F as well as \u03b4.y = x to \u03b4.x. So by part (a) of Definition 38, \u03b4 = \u03b4\u03b4(y),\u03b4(x) .\nTherefore, now by part (b) of Definition 38, \u03b4y,x = \u03b4 \u22121 \u03b4\u03b4(y),\u03b4(x) \u03b4 = \u03b4 \u22121 \u03b4\u03b4 = \u03b4 = \u03b4x,y \u22121 ,\n\n\fCOMMENSURATORS OF SOME NON-UNIFORM TREE LATTICES AND MOUFANG TWIN TREES 11\n\nproving (iii). In order to verify (iv), we first note that, again by part (b) of Definition 38,\n\u03b4y,z = \u03b4 \u22121 \u03b4\u03b4(y),\u03b4(z) \u03b4 = \u03b4 \u22121 \u03b4x,\u03b4(z) \u03b4, which is an element of hUj,s | j > ii. Hence also \u03b4y,z \u03b4x,y is\nan element of hUj,s | j > ii, and by (i), it sends x to z. Therefore, by part (a) of Definition\n38, \u03b4y,z \u03b4x,y = \u03b4x,z , proving (iv).\n\u0003\n2.2. Connected components of bounded level. We are now going to generalize the\nstrategy of [BM96, Section 8.3] to the present situation. We recall the definition of a certain\ngraph Gi associated to T and a given level i > 0.\nDefinition 41. For i > 0, we denote by Ti the subforest of T spanned by all vertices of level\n\u2264 i. For any vertex x with l(x) \u2264 i, we denote by Ci (x) the connected component of Ti\ncontaining x. We set\nCi := {Ci (x) | x \u2208 V T and l(x) \u2264 i},\nand define a (simplicial) graph\nGi = (V Gi , EGi )\n\nwith vertex set\n\nV Gi = Ci\n\nby declaring a two element subset {X, Y } of V Gi to be in the edge set EGi if and only if there\nexist vertices x \u2208 X, y \u2208 Y such that l(x) = l(y) = i and y \u2208 HS(x).\nRemarks 42. 1. If {X, Y } \u2208 EGi , the vertices x \u2208 X and y \u2208 Y in the above definition\nare uniquely determined: they are the unique terminal vertices of X and Y , respectively,\ncontained in any geodesic in T which starts in a vertex of X and ends in a vertex of Y .\n2. If X, Y \u2208 Ci are given, there is a unique geodesic in Gi connecting them. It is obtained from\nan arbitrary geodesic p in T which connects a vertex of X to a vertex of Y by first intersecting\np with Ti , yielding a disjoint union p\u2032 of geodesics in Ti , then replacing these subgeodesics\nof p\u2032 with their corresponding connected components in Ci (considered as elements of V Gi )\nand connecting the adjacent ones among them by edges in EGi .\n3. A path P in Gi , i.e. a finite sequence P = (X0 , . . . , Xn ) with Xj \u2208 Ci for all j \u2264 n and\n{Xj , Xj+1 } \u2208 EGi for all j < n, is a geodesic in Gi if and only if Xj+2 is neither equal nor\nadjacent to Xj for all j \u2264 n \u2212 2. In fact, there is only one path P between X0 and Xn in Gi\nwith this last mentioned property. This follows from the uniqueness of geodesics in T .\nThe elements \u03b4x,y introduced in the previous Subsection now provide us with transformations\n\u03c4X,Y mapping X \u2208 Ci onto Y \u2208 Ci .\nDefinition 43. Let X, Y \u2208 Ci be given.\n(a) If X and Y are adjacent in Gi , and if x \u2208 V X, y \u2208 V Y are such that y \u2208 HS(x), we\nset \u03c4X,Y := \u03b4x,y . This is well-defined by Remark 42 (1).\n(b) If X and Y are arbitrary, we consider the unique geodesic (X = X0 , X1 , * * * ,\nXn = Y ) from X to Y in Gi , and set \u03c4X,Y := \u03c4Xn\u22121 ,Xn \u03c4Xn\u22122 ,Xn\u22121 * * * \u03c4X0 ,X1 . We also\nset \u03c4X,X := 1.\nRemark 44. We note that \u03c4X,Y = \u03c4Zm\u22121 ,Zm \u03c4Zm\u22122 ,Zm\u22121 * * * \u03c4Z0 ,Z1 is true for any path P =\n(X = Z0 , Z1 , * * * , Zm = Y ) connecting X and Y in Gi . Indeed, if P is not a geodesic, then\nby Remark 42 (3), there exists a subpath (A, B, C) of P such that A = C or {A, C} \u2208 EGi .\nIn the first case, we delete B and C = A from P and observe that \u03c4B,A \u03c4A,B = 1 by Lemma\n40 (iii). In the second case, we delete B from P and note that \u03c4B,C \u03c4A,B = \u03c4A,C by Lemma\n40 (iv). So simultaneously shortening the path P and the product of \u03c4 's associated to it\nwithout changing the value of this product, we finally obtain the geodesic between X and\n\n\f12\n\nPETER ABRAMENKO AND BERTRAND R\u00c9MY\n\nY in Gi , and the associated product is precisely the one occurring in the above definition of\n\u03c4X,Y .\nLemma 45. For any X, Y, Z \u2208 Ci , we have:\n(i) \u03c4X,Y \u2208 \u2206 and \u03c4X,Y (X) = Y ;\n(ii) h\u03c4X,Y h\u22121 = \u03c4h(X),h(Y ) for all h \u2208 \u2206;\n(iii) \u03c4Y,X = \u03c4X,Y \u22121 ;\n(iv) \u03c4Y,Z \u03c4X,Y = \u03c4X,Z .\nProof. The properties (i) to (iii) follow directly from the corresponding statements in Lemma\n40, and (iv) is a consequence of Remark 44.\n\u0003\nWe close this subsection by introducing truncated versions of T , R, F and \u2206. For i > 0, we\nset Yi := Ci (x0 ), R(i) := R \u2229 Yi , F (i) := F \u2229 Yi = \u03930 .R(i) and\n\u2206i := hUj,s | 1 \u2264 j \u2264 i and 1 \u2264 s \u2264 ki.\nLemma 46.\n(i) R(i) is a fundamental domain for the action of h\u03930 \u222a \u0393i i = Stab\u0393 (Yi )\non Yi ;\n(ii) F (i) is a fundamental domain for the action of \u2206i = Stab\u2206 (Yi ) on Yi ;\n(iii) \u2206i (or more precisely: its image in Aut(Yi )) is a uniform Yi -lattice.\nProof. Set \u0393\u2032 := h\u03930 \u222a \u0393i i, which is obviously contained in Stab\u0393 (Yi ). It is clear that \u0393\u2032 .R(i)\ncontains a neighborhood of R(i) in Yi . Thus \u0393\u2032 .R(i) is open in Yi . But as a subgraph of Yi ,\nit is also closed. Since Yi is connected, we conclude \u0393\u2032 .R(i) = Yi . (Side remark: this kind\nof reasoning already occurs in [Ser77].) Thus \u0393\u2032 \\ Yi = R(i) . If \u03b3 \u2208 \u0393 stabilizes Yi , then\n\u03b3.xj \u2208 \u0393\u2032 .xj for any j \u2264 i, and since Stab\u0393 (xj ) = \u0393j \u2286 \u0393\u2032 , we obtain \u03b3 \u2208 \u0393\u2032 . This proves (i).\nThe proof of (ii) is similar. We just observe that also \u2206i .F (i) (which contains a neighborhood\nof x0 by definition of F (i) ) is open in Yi due to the transitivity properties of the Uj,s (see\nFact 24). This implies \u2206i .F (i) = Yi and hence \u2206i \\ Yi = F (i) . Since Stab\u2206 (x) \u2286 \u2206i for all\nvertices x \u2208 F (i) (Claim 36 (ii)), we also obtain \u2206i = Stab\u2206 (Yi ). Finally, (iii) is an immediate\nconsequence of (ii).\n\u0003\n2.3. Permuting elements of the same level. We now replace the analysis of hh local\ndata ii which were used in [BM96] and [Moz99] by a more group theoretic construction. The\nlatter is based on the observation Lemma 37 (ii) above and similar to the definition of the\n\u03b4x,y . However, one has to be a bit careful here since \u2206 does not act transitively on the set\nof vertices of a given level.\nDefinition 47. For any given vertex x of level i > 0, let s = s(x) be the unique integer with\n1 \u2264 s \u2264 k and x \u2208 \u2206.Rs (see Lemma 35).\n(a) We choose once and for all a \u03b4x \u2208 \u2206 such that x = \u03b4x .xi,s = (\u03b4x \u03b3s ).xi , and we set:\n\u03b3x := \u03b4x \u03b3s .\n(b) For any two vertices x, y of the same level i > 0, we define: \u03b3x,y := \u03b3y \u03b3x \u22121 .\nNote that we work with the fixed system of coset representatives {\u03b31 := 1; \u03b32 ; * * * ; \u03b3k } for\n\u03930 /H0 and that \u03b3x,y need not coincide with \u03b4x,y in case x and y are in the same horosphere\n(see, however, (iv) below which we will need to prove Claim 52).\nLemma 48. For vertices x, y, z of the same level i > 0, we have:\n\n\fCOMMENSURATORS OF SOME NON-UNIFORM TREE LATTICES AND MOUFANG TWIN TREES 13\n\n(i)\n(ii)\n(iii)\n(iv)\n\n\u03b3x,y is in \u0393 and \u03b3x,y .x = y;\n\u03b3y,x = \u03b3x,y \u22121 ;\n\u03b3y,z \u03b3x,y = \u03b3x,z ;\nif y \u2208 \u2206.x then \u03b3x,y \u2208 \u2206.\n\nProof. (i), (ii) and (iii) are obvious by definition. If x \u2208 \u2206.Rs and y \u2208 \u2206.Rt with 1 \u2264 s, t \u2264 k,\nthen \u03b3x,y \u2208 \u2206\u03b3t \u03b3s \u22121 \u2206 = \u2206\u03b3t \u03b3s \u22121 because \u2206 \u22b3 \u0393 (Lemma 32). This implies (iv).\n\u0003\nThe next property is a bit more subtle. It will be needed in order to obtain a reasonable\ndefinition of the groups Li (see Definition 50 and Remark 51 (1)) which are essential for the\nextensions to be constructed in the next subsection.\nLemma 49. If x, y are vertices of level i > 0, x\u2032 \u2208 HS(x) and y \u2032 := \u03b3x,y (x\u2032 ), then we have:\n\u03b3x,y |HB(x) = \u03b3x\u2032 ,y\u2032 |HB(x) .\nProof. By Lemma 48 (iii), we have: \u03b3x\u2032 ,y\u2032 = \u03b3y,y\u2032 \u03b3x,y \u03b3x\u2032 ,x . Since x\u2032 \u2208 HS(x) and hence\ny \u2032 \u2208 \u03b3x,y .HS(x) = HS(y), x\u2032 \u2208 \u2206.x and y \u2032 \u2208 \u2206.y by the transitive action of \u2206 on HS(x),\nrespectively HS(y) (combine Claim 36 and Lemma 35). Thus Lemma 48 (iv) tells us that\n\u03b3x\u2032 ,x and \u03b3y,y\u2032 are in \u2206. Therefore \u03b3x\u2032 ,y\u2032 \u2208 \u2206\u03b3x,y \u2206 = \u03b3x,y \u2206, the last equality again following\nfrom \u2206 \u22b3 \u0393. Hence there exists a \u03b4 \u2208 \u2206 such that \u03b3x\u2032 ,y\u2032 = \u03b3x,y \u03b4. Since \u03b4.x\u2032 = \u03b3x,y \u22121 \u03b3x\u2032,y\u2032 .x\u2032 =\n\u03b3x,y \u22121 (y \u2032) = x\u2032 , we have \u03b4 \u2208 Stab\u2206 (x\u2032 ). Therefore \u03b4 acts trivially on HB(x\u2032 ) = HB(x) (Lemma\n\u0003\n37), and finally: \u03b3x\u2032 ,y\u2032 |HB(x) = \u03b3x,y \u03b4 |HB(x) = \u03b3x,y |HB(x) .\n2.4. Extensions and commensurators. We can now define suitable extensions of isomorphisms between subtrees X, Y \u2208 Ci of T (see Proposition 53 below). For this we need to\ndefine certain subgroups of L.\nDefinition 50. Let i > 0 be a positive integer. By Li we denote the group of all levelpreserving automorphisms h \u2208 Aut(T ) satisfying:\n(a) for any vertex x with l(x) = i, h |HB(x) = \u03b3x,h(x) |HB(x) ;\n(b) for all X, Y \u2208 Ci , (h\u03c4X,Y h\u22121 ) |h(X) = \u03c4h(X),h(Y ) |h(X) .\nRemarks 51. 1. Li is indeed a subgroup of L. If g, h \u2208 Li then gh, h\u22121 clearly satisfy (b),\nand it follows from Lemma 48 that they also satisfy (a). In the extension procedure, we only\nneed property (a) of the above definition at certain vertices x. However, one would not get\na reasonable definition of Li if one did not require (a) for all level i vertices x. But then\none has to check that the different vertices in HS(x) do not lead to different conditions for\nh |HB(x) : this is precisely what we established in Lemma 49.\n2. It is sufficient to require Condition (b) for a fixed X0 \u2208 Ci (and all Y \u2208 Ci ). This follows\nfrom Lemma 45: \u03c4X,Y = \u03c4X0 ,Y \u03c4X0 ,X \u22121 for all X, Y \u2208 Ci .\nClaim 52. For all i > 0, the group \u2206 is contained in Li .\nProof. Condition (a) for elements of \u2206 follows from combining Lemma 37 (ii) and Lemma\n48 (iv). Condition (b) follows from Lemma 45 (ii).\n\u0003\nUp to replacing local data by the elements \u03b3x,y , the next proposition is similar to [BM96,\nProposition 8.5].\nProposition 53. For any two X, Y \u2208 Ci and any level-preserving isomorphism h : X \u2192 Y ,\nthere is a unique extension of h to an automorphism E(h) \u2208 Li .\n\n\f14\n\nPETER ABRAMENKO AND BERTRAND R\u00c9MY\n\nProof. We first show how we can (and must) extend h to horoballs and elements of Ci which\nare neighboring X.\n(1) Definition of E(h) on HB(x). According to Condition (a) of Definition 50, we have only\none choice to define E(h) on HB(x) for x \u2208 V X with l(x) = i, namely by E(h) |HB(x) =\n\u03b3x,y |HB(x) , where y := h(x).\n(2) Definition of E(h) on Z. For x 6= z \u2208 HS(x), we set Z := Ci (z) \u2208 Ci , z \u2032 := E(h)(z) =\n\u03b3x,y (z) and Z \u2032 := Ci (z \u2032 ). Note that z \u2032 \u2208 HS(y). According to Condition (b) of Definition 50,\nwe have to define E(h) on Z by E(h) |Z = \u03c4Y,Z \u2032 h\u03c4Z,X |Z .\n(3) Equality of the two definitions on {z} = Z \u2229 HB(x). Since z \u2032 \u2208 HS(y) and z \u2208 HS(x),\nDefinition 43 implies \u03c4Y,Z \u2032 (y) = z \u2032 and \u03c4Z,X (z) = x. Hence \u03c4Y,Z \u2032 h\u03c4Z,X |Z (z) = \u03c4Y,Z \u2032 h(x) =\n\u03c4Y,Z \u2032 (y) = z \u2032 = \u03b3x,y (z).\n(4) Global definition of E(h). Now an easy induction along geodesics in Gi which start in\nX shows that we can, in precisely one way, extend the definition of E(h) to horoballs and\nelements of Ci in the neighborhood of Z\u0303 for any Z\u0303 \u2208 Ci on which E(h) is already defined.\nWe thus get an automorphism E(h) of T , and it is clear by construction that E(h) is levelpreserving.\n(5) E(h) is an element of Li . For any horoball H = HB(v), (v \u2208 V T with l(v) = i), there is by\nconstruction of E(h) a z1 \u2208 HS = HS(v) such that E(h) |H = \u03b3z1 ,z2 |H , where z2 = E(h)(z1 ).\nBut then by Lemma 49, E(h) |H = \u03b3w1 ,w2 |H with w2 = E(h)(w1 ) for all w1 \u2208 HS, yielding\nCondition (a) of Definition 50. To check Condition (b), we first consider an edge {A, B}\nin Gi such that A is nearer to X than B, and set A\u2032 = E(h)(A), B \u2032 = E(h)(B). By the\ninductive definition of E(h), we have E(h)\u03c4A,B E(h)\u22121 |A\u2032 = \u03c4A\u2032 ,B\u2032 |A\u2032 . Similarly for all edges\non the geodesic in Gi between X and B. Applying Definition 43 to \u03c4X,B , we now obtain\nE(h)\u03c4X,B E(h)\u22121 |Y = \u03c4Y,B\u2032 |Y . Since B \u2208 Ci can be chosen arbitrarily, Remark 51 (2) implies\nthat Condition (b) is also satisfied.\n\u0003\nThe next proposition shows that the above extension procedure is compatible with commensurators. This is [BM96, Proposition 8.6], which we reproduce to correct minor misprints\nand because we deal with the group \u2206 rather than \u0393. We denote the fact that a subgroup\nN is of finite index in a group H by writing: N <f.i. H. Since \u2206 <f.i. \u0393, the commensurators C(\u2206) and C(\u0393) of these groups in G coincide. We keep the notations Yi = Ci (x0 ) and\n\u2206i = Stab\u2206 (Yi ) introduced in Lemma 46 and set Gi := Aut(Yi ), G\u2032i := {h \u2208 Gi | l(h.x) = l(x)\nfor all x \u2208 V Yi }.\nProposition 54. Let \u2206i be the natural image of \u2206i in G\u2032i . Then for any g \u2208 CommG\u2032i (\u2206i ), the\nunique extension E(g) \u2208 Li provided by Proposition 53 lies in the commensurator CommL (\u2206) =\nC(\u2206) \u2229 L.\nProof. We first remark that the map E : G\u2032i \u2192 Li , h 7\u2192 E(h) is a homomorphism by the\nuniqueness statement of Proposition 53. It is enough to show that for any g \u2208 CommG\u2032i (\u2206i ),\nwe have \u2206 \u2229 E(g)\u2206E(g)\u22121 <f.i. \u2206. (Indeed, apply it to g \u22121 and conjugate by E(g) to\ndeduce that \u2206 \u2229 E(g)\u2206E(g)\u22121 <f.i. E(g)\u2206E(g)\u22121.) By F\ndefinition of a commensurator, there\nr\nis {\u03b4j }j=1 \u2282 \u2206i such that, with \u03b4 j := \u03b4j |Yi , \u2206i = rj=1 \u03b4 j (\u2206i \u2229 g\u2206i g \u22121 ). It is enough\nS\nto prove that we have: \u2206 = rj=1 \u03b4j (\u2206 \u2229 E(g)\u2206E(g)\u22121). Let \u03b4 \u2208 \u2206.

By uniqueness (Proposition 53), this will show that E(g)\u22121(\u03b4j\u22121 \u03b4)E(g) \u2208\n\u2206. The element \u03b4 being arbitrary in \u2206, this will finally prove: \u2206 \u2229 E(g)\u2206E(g)\u22121 <f.i. \u2206.\nWe are thus led to computing:\n\u0001\nE(g)\u22121(\u03b4j\u22121 \u03b4)E(g) |Yi = E(g)\u22121 |\u03b4\u22121 \u03b4.Yi \u25e6 \u03b4j\u22121 |\u03b4.Yi \u25e6 \u03b4 |Yi \u25e6 g = E(\u03b4 j g)\u22121 |\u03b4.Yi \u25e6 \u03b4 |Yi \u25e6 g.\nj\n\nWe make \u03c3 appear on the right to obtain an element of \u2206i :\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u22121\n= E(\u03b4 j g)\u22121 |\u03b4.Yi \u25e6 (\u03c4\u03b4.Yi ,Yi |\u03b4.Yi )\u22121 \u25e6 \u03b4 j \u25e6 g \u25e6 g \u22121 \u25e6 \u03b4 j \u25e6 \u03c4\u03b4.Yi ,Yi |\u03b4.Yi \u25e6 \u03b4 |Yi \u25e6 g\n\u0001\n= E(\u03b4 j g)\u22121 |\u03b4.Yi \u25e6 (\u03c4\u03b4.Yi ,Yi |\u03b4.Yi )\u22121 \u25e6 \u03b4 j \u25e6 g \u25e6 \u03c3\n\u0001\n= E(\u03b4 j g)\u22121 |\u03b4.Yi \u25e6 \u03c4Yi ,\u03b4.Yi |Yi \u25e6 E(\u03b4j g) |Yi \u25e6 \u03c3.\nSince E(\u03b4 j g) \u2208 Li , this last product is \u03c4Yi ,Z |Yi \u25e6 \u03c3, where Z := E(\u03b4j g)\u22121(\u03b4.Yi ).

Density. We are now in a position to complete the proof of our main density theorem.\nThe main tools will be Proposition 54 and Liu's theorem on the arithmeticity of uniform\ntree lattices.\nProof of Theorem 4. Given any level-preserving isomorphism \u03c6 : T1 \u2192 T2 between two finite\nsubtrees T1 and T2 of T , we have to find an element h \u2208 C(\u0393) \u2229 L = C(\u2206) \u2229 L such that\nh|T1 = \u03c6. We choose i > 0 big enough so that the subtree Yi = Ci (x0 ) of T introduced in\nLemma 46 satisfies the following two conditions:\n(i) the subtree Yi contains T1 \u222a T2 ;\n(ii) the tree Yi is not biregular.\nWe briefly explain why Condition (ii) can always be achieved and why we need it. First recall\nthat the vertices of level j < i in Yi have the same degree in Yi as in T , namely qj + 1 (Facts\n12 and 13). And the vertices of level i are of degree qi in Yi . So either T is not biregular,\nand there exists an l such that ql 6= ql+2 ; then we choose i > l + 2. Or T is biregular, with\ndegrees q0 + 1 and q1 + 1. In this case Yi is not biregular for any i \u2265 2. If Yi is not biregular,\nthen we know from Lemma 16, Remark 17 and Lemma 46 (i) that all automorphisms of\nYi are automatically level\u2013preserving. This means G\u2032i = Gi = Aut(Yi ) in the notation of\nProposition 54.\nNow \u2206i , the image of \u2206i in Gi , is a uniform Yi -lattice (Lemma 46 (iii)). So by Liu's theorem,\nthe commensurator CommGi (\u2206i ) is dense in Gi = G\u2032i . Hence there exists a g \u2208 CommG\u2032i (\u2206i )\nsatisfying g|T1 = \u03c6. By Proposition 53, g can be (uniquely) extended to an element h := E(g)\nof Li . Then Proposition 54 implies that h \u2208 C(\u2206) \u2229 L, and by construction h|T1 = \u03c6.\n\u0003\nTheorem 4 has some immediate consequences which are worth to be mentioned. The first\none is the generalization of the example discussed in [BM96, Section 8.3] to the class of all\nlattices of directly split Nagao type with associated non-biregular tree T . Recall that L = G\nin these cases (see Lemma 16).\n\n\f16\n\nPETER ABRAMENKO AND BERTRAND R\u00c9MY\n\nCorollary 55. If \u0393 is a T -lattice of directly split Nagao type and T is not biregular, then\nC(\u0393) is dense in G = Aut(T ).\n\u0003\nThe next corollary combines Theorem 4 and Proposition 20. It was stated as Theorem 5 in\nthe introduction.\nCorollary 56. If \u0393 is a T -lattice of directly split Nagao type and T is biregular, then either\nC(\u0393) is a subgroup of L which is then dense in L or else the closure of C(\u0393) in G contains\nG\u25e6 .\n\u0003\nFor regular trees, this has the following immediate consequence.\nCorollary 57. If \u0393 is a T -lattice of directly split Nagao type such that T is regular and C(\u0393)\ncontains a type-interchanging automorphism, then C(\u0393) is dense in G.\n\u0003\nIf T is biregular, it is in general hard to see (and we do not know of any general method how\nto decide this question) whether C(\u0393) is included in L or not. However, there is one class of\nlattices of Nagao type where C(\u0393) 6\u2286 L is obvious, and this class of lattices we are going to\ndiscuss in the next section.\n3. Applications to Moufang twin trees\nWe introduce Moufang twin trees and recall some decompositions available for groups acting\non these trees: this enables us to connect this theory to the previous section. We also\nprovide examples, from the Nagao lattice to more exotic twin trees, including generalized\nrank 2 Kac-Moody groups. General references for twin trees are [RT94], [RT99] and [Tit90,\n\u00a79].\n3.1. Twin trees without groups. The notion of codistance relating two trees can be\nintroduced without reference to any group action [RT94, \u00a71]. In this first subsection, we\nintroduce as many notions as possible purely in combinatorial terms. We will show later\nhow they coincide with previously defined objects in the Nagao context, when we have\nenough automorphisms.\nDefinition 58. Let (T\u00b1 , \u03b4 \u2217 ) be a triple where T+ and T\u2212 are trees and where \u03b4 \u2217 is a function\nwith values in N on pairs of vertices of opposite signs in T+ \u2294 T\u2212 . We say that (T\u00b1 , \u03b4 \u2217 ) is a\ntwin tree or, equivalently, that \u03b4 \u2217 is a codistance between T+ and T\u2212 if \u03b4 \u2217 satisfies:\n(Codist) For any x+ \u2208 V T+ and any y\u2212 \u2208 V T\u2212 , we have \u03b4 \u2217 (y\u2212 , x+ ) = \u03b4 \u2217 (x+ , y\u2212 ), and\n\u2032\nfurthermore, setting m := \u03b4 \u2217 (x+ , y\u2212 ): for each y\u2212\n\u2208 V T\u2212 adjacent to y\u2212 , one obtains\n\u2217\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u03b4 (x+ , y\u2212 ) = m \u00b1 1; if m > 0 there is a unique y\u2212\nsuch that \u03b4 \u2217 (x+ , y\u2212\n) = m + 1; and\nwe require the similar conditions with T+ and T\u2212 interchanged.\nIn this case, we say that two vertices of opposite signs are opposite if their codistance is 0.\nAn automorphism of the twin tree (T\u00b1 , \u03b4 \u2217 ) is a pair (\u03b1+ , \u03b1\u2212 ) of automorphisms of T+ ,\nrespectively T\u2212 , such that \u03b4 \u2217 (\u03b1+ (x+ ), \u03b1\u2212 (y\u2212 )) = \u03b4 \u2217 (x+ , y\u2212 ) for any x+ \u2208 V T+ and any y\u2212 \u2208\nV T\u2212 . We denote the group of all automorphisms of (T\u00b1 , \u03b4 \u2217 ) by A.\nTwo vertices in a tree have the same type if they are at even distance from one another.\nAdding that two vertices of opposite sign have the same type if they are at even codistance,\n\n\fCOMMENSURATORS OF SOME NON-UNIFORM TREE LATTICES AND MOUFANG TWIN TREES 17\n\nwe obtain an equivalence relation (with two classes) on the vertices of T+ \u2294 T\u2212 [RT94, p.\n406]. Two thick trees (i.e. two trees where all vertices have degree at least 3) related by\na codistance are isomorphic and biregular because any two vertices of the same type have\nthe same degree [RT94, Proposition 1]. We denote the types by 0 and 1 and write them\nas subscripts when needed. Note that we do not require automorphisms of twin trees to be\ntype-preserving. We denote by A\u25e6 the subgroup of A of all type-preserving automorphisms\nof (T\u00b1 , \u03b4 \u2217 ). Obviously, [A : A\u25e6 ] \u2264 2.\n+\n\u2212\n\u2212\nLet x+\n0 and x1 be two adjacent vertices in T+ . We can choose two vertices x0 and x1 such\n\u2212\nthat x+\ni and xi are opposite, i \u2208 {0; 1}: these vertices will be called the standard positive or\nnegative vertices of type 0 or 1, accordingly. A pair of geodesic lines L\u00b1 \u2282 T\u00b1 is called a twin\napartment if any vertex in L := L+ \u222a L\u2212 has a unique opposite in L. By [RT94, Proposition\n3.5] there is a unique twin apartment containing the four standard vertices, which we call\nthe standard twin apartment. It follows from the axioms of a codistance that the codistance\nbetween to vertices of opposite sign in a twin apartment is the distance between any of the\ntwo points to the unique opposite of the other one in the twin apartment.\n\nA straightforward consequence of (Codist) is a monotonicity property distinguishing a subfamily of geodesic rays and boundary points in each tree [RT94, 3.1-3.4]: for each pair of\nnon-opposite vertices x+ and y\u2212 there is a unique ray in T+ (resp. in T\u2212 ) emanating from\nx+ (resp. y\u2212 ) along which the codistance from y\u2212 (resp. x+ ) is increasing. This defines a\nunique point \u03be(x+ )y\u2212 of the ideal boundary \u2202\u221e T+ and a unique point \u03b7(y\u2212 )x+ of the ideal\nboundary \u2202\u221e T\u2212 , so that the rays are [x+ ; \u03be(x+ )y\u2212 ) and [y\u2212 ; \u03b7(y\u2212 )x+ ). Using a standard pair\nof opposite vertices x\u00b1\ni , we see that the above monotonicity arguments naturally define in\nT\u00b1 a union of geodesic rays, which we call the standard infinite star of type i and which we\n\u00b1\n\u221e \u00b1\ndenote by St\u221e (x\u00b1\ni ). The number of rays from xi in St (xi ) is the valency of this vertex.\n3.2. Root groups and Moufang condition. The root system \u03a6 attached to an arbitrary\nCoxeter system is defined in [Tit87, Sect. 5] or in [Hum90, II.5]. We are interested in the\nspecific case where the Coxeter group is the infinite dihedral group D\u221e = Z/2\u2217Z/2, say with\ngenerators s0 and s1 . The associated Coxeter complex is the tiling of the real line R by the\nsegments [n; n + 1], n \u2208 Z. Let s0 (resp. s1 ) be the reflection x 7\u2192 \u2212x (resp. x 7\u2192 2 \u2212 x). The\nroots of \u03a6 are the half-lines defined by the integers, the positive ones being those containing\n[0, 1]. Each vertex has type 0 or 1, the boundary of a root is called its vertex, and the type of\na root a is the type of its vertex. Two roots a and b are prenilpotent with one another if a \u2286 b\nor b \u2286 a [Tit87]. Let a0 := [0; +\u221e) and a1 := (\u2212\u221e; 1] be the roots whose intersection is the\nedge E := [0; 1]. A useful viewpoint on twin apartments is to see them as two Tits cones of\nthe same Weyl group glued along their tip [Rem02b, 5.3.2]. In our case, a twin apartment\nis the double cone generated by the above tiling of the real line. We recover the geodesics\nL\u00b1 as the affinizations of the double cone. A twin root generated by a root a of any sign is\nthen the half-plane bounded by the line passing through the origin and the vertex of a, and\ncontaining a. We denote it by a, too. Two twin roots generated by prenilpotent roots a and\nb are also called prenilpotent.\nFor a single building, the Moufang condition is discussed in detail in [Ron89, \u00a76]. For twin\ntrees it is introduced in [RT94, pp. 475-476] as follows. Let a be a twin root in the twin\napartment L. Let us denote by Ua the group of automorphisms of (T\u00b1 , \u03b4 \u2217 ) fixing the half\n\n\f18\n\nPETER ABRAMENKO AND BERTRAND R\u00c9MY\n\ntwin apartment a and every edge having a vertex in the interior of a. By [RT94, Proposition\n4.1], the group Ua acts freely on the set of twin apartments containing a, but it may be\ntrivial. If the action is transitive we say that Ua is a root group.\nDefinition 59. We say that a twin tree (T\u00b1 , \u03b4 \u2217 ) satisfies the Moufang property or is a\nMoufang twin tree if there is a twin apartment L in which Ua is a root group for each twin\nroot a \u2282 L. We denote by \u039b the subgroup of A\u25e6 generated by the root groups Ua .\nThe definition seems to depend on the choice of a twin apartment, but if a twin tree is\nMoufang, then \u039b is transitive on the set of twin apartments [RT94, Proposition 4.5]. Note\nthat so far the roles of the trees T+ and T\u2212 are symmetric. The Moufang property says that\nthe valency at a vertex v is 1 greater than the order of the root group attached to a twin\nroot whose boundary contains v, so the trees are locally finite if and only if the root groups\nare finite, in which case the pointwise fixator of a twin apartment, which we denote by H,\nis finite too.\nPicture 60.\nx+\n\u22121\n\nstandard edge E+\nx+\n1\n\nx+\n0\n\nx+\ni\n\npositive geodesic L+\nof the twin apartment\nnegative twin root \u2212ai\n\npositive twin root ai\n\nx\u2212\ni\n\nx\u2212\n1\n\nx\u2212\n0\n\nx\u2212\n\u22121\n\nstandard edge E\u2212\n\nnegative geodesic L\u2212\nof the twin apartment\n\nWe now introduce a subgroup of \u039b for which the symmetry doesn't hold any longer.\nDefinition 61. We denote by Stab\u039b (x\u01eb ) (where \u01eb \u2208 {+, \u2212}) the stabilizer in \u039b of any point\n\u2212\nx\u01eb \u2208 T\u01eb . We use \u0393 instead of Stab\u039b (x\u01eb ) when x\u01eb is the vertex x\u2212\n0 or x1 and the choice of one\nof these two points is clear.\nThe group Stab\u039b (x\u01eb ) naturally acts on the tree of sign \u2212\u01eb. Since \u039b acts edge-transitively on\n\u2212\nT\u2212 , up to conjugacy the possible \u0393-actions are those of Stab\u039b (x\u2212\n0 ), of Stab\u039b (x1 ) and of their\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\u2212\nintersection Stab\u039b ([x0 ; x1 ]). Henceforth, we fix a vertex v\u2212 := xi , i \u2208 {0; 1}, and consider\nthe corresponding \u0393-action on the positive tree T+ . The subgroup generated by the root\ngroups Ua indexed by the twin roots a containing v\u2212 is a finite index subgroup of \u0393 = \u039b(v\u2212 ).\n3.3. Connection with lattices of Nagao type. Let us first recall the technical condition\non Moufang twin trees already stated in the introduction.\n\n\fCOMMENSURATORS OF SOME NON-UNIFORM TREE LATTICES AND MOUFANG TWIN TREES 19\n\nDefinition 62. We say that a Moufang twin tree (T\u00b1 , \u03b4 \u2217 ), or the associated group \u039b, satisfies\ncondition (Comm) if any two root groups Ua and Ub commute whenever a and b are different,\nprenilpotent twin roots.\nWe can now formulate the result relating Moufang twin trees and lattices of Nagao type.\nProposition 63. Let (T\u00b1 , \u03b4 \u2217 ) be a thick locally finite Moufang twin tree. Let A be its\nautomorphism group and let \u039b be the subgroup generated by the root groups. We fix a twin\napartment L\u00b1 , a pair of opposite vertices v\u00b1 \u2208 L\u00b1 , and we denote by \u0393 the group Stab\u039b (v\u2212 ).\nFor each sign \u01eb = \u00b1, we number {vj\u01eb }j\u2208Z the vertices of L\u01eb in such a way that v0\u01eb = v\u01eb and\n\u01eb\nfor any j, vj\u01eb and vj+1\nare neighbours and vj\u01eb and vj\u2212\u01eb are opposite. For each j \u2208 Z, we denote\nby Vj (resp. Uj ) the positive (resp. negative) root group associated to the twin root whose\nboundary is {vj+ ; vj\u2212 }, and we denote by E+ (resp. E\u2212 ) the edge [v0+ ; v1+ ] (resp. [v0\u2212 ; v1\u2212 ]).\n(i) Any of the two geodesic rays {vj }j\u22650 and {vj }j\u22640 from v+ is a fundamental domain\nfor the \u0393-action on T+ .\n(ii) The stabilizer StabA (E+ \u222a {v\u2212 }) is finite, and in particular so is H0 := Stab\u0393 (E+ ).\nMoreover we have the decomposition: Stab\u0393 (vj ) = H0 \u22c9 (U1 . * * * .Uj ) for each j > 0,\nand the stabilizer Stab\u0393 (v0 ) is the finite group generated by H0 and the root groups\nindexed by the two opposite twin roots bounded by v\u2212 and v+ .\n(iii) The group \u0393, as well as its action on T+ , identifies with the group and the action\nattached to the graph of groups of Picture 9, where the geodesic ray is {vj }j\u22650 and\nthe groups are the above stabilizers.\n(iv) The group \u0393 is a T+ -lattice of Nagao type, which is of directly split Nagao type\nwhenever (T\u00b1 , \u03b4 \u2217 ) satisfies (Comm).\n(v) The level function on the positive vertices is nothing else than the codistance from\nthe \u0393-fixed negative vertex v\u2212 , that is: l(x) = \u03b4 \u2217 (v\u2212 , x) for any x \u2208 V T+ .\nProof. Recall that two edges are called opposite if the two corresponding pairs of vertices of\nopposite signs and same type are pairs of opposite vertices. According to [Tit92, Proposition\n7], the groups A and \u039b both admit a structure of RGD-system [Tit92, 3.3], also called a\ntwin root datum \u2013 see also [Abr97, I, Definition 2] or [Rem02b, Chapter 1]. To the RGDsystem is naturally attached a positive (resp. negative) Tits system whose Borel subgroups\nare the stabilizers of the edges in T+ (resp. in T\u2212 ) [Abr97, \u00a71, Proposition 1]. The group \u0393\nis a parabolic subgroup of the negative Tits system and (i) is a special case of [Abr97, \u00a73,\nCorollary 1], which applies to general Moufang twin buildings.\nWe have \u03b4 \u2217 (v1+ , v0\u2212 ) = 1 because v1+ and v1\u2212 are opposite and v1\u2212 and v0\u2212 are neighbors. Since\n\u2212\nL\u00b1 is a twin apartment, v1\u2212 is the only neighbor of v0\u2212 in L\u2212 which is opposite v1+ , so that v\u22121\nis the only neighbor of v0\u2212 to be at codistance 2 from v1+ . Therefore the positive root group\n\u2212\nV0 acts transitively on the neighbors of v0\u2212 which are 6= v\u22121\n. Let h \u2208 StabA (E+ \u222a {v\u2212 });\n\u22121\nby the previous sentence, we can find u \u2208 V0 such that u h \u2208 StabA (E+ \u222a E\u2212 ), so that\nStabA (E+ \u222a {v\u2212 }) = V0 * StabA (E+ \u222a E\u2212 ). Finally, the finiteness of StabA (E+ \u222a E\u2212 ) follows\nfrom Ronan-Tits' rigidity theorem [RT94, Theorem 4.1], which says that the identity is the\nonly twinning automorphism which fixes E+ , E\u2212 and all the edges having a vertex in common\nwith E+ . Since \u039b < A, this obviously implies the finiteness of H0 = Stab\u0393 (E+ ). The rest of\n(ii) is a special case of Levi decompositions of stabilizers of pairs of points of opposite signs\nin twin buildings [Rem02b, 6.3.4].\n\n\f20\n\nPETER ABRAMENKO AND BERTRAND R\u00c9MY\n\nFor a general Moufang twin tree, the group U1 . * * * .Ui is in bijection with the set U1 \u00d7* * *\u00d7Ui ,\nand it is isomorphic to the direct product group U1 \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 Ui whenever (Comm) is satisfied:\nthis proves (iv), once we note that (iii) is a classical consequence of Bass-Serre theory [Ser77,\nI.4.5, Th\u00e9or\u00e8me 10]. At last, (v) follows from the fact that the two functions l(*) and \u03b4 \u2217 (v\u2212 , *)\ncoincide on the ray {vj }j\u22650 and are constant on each \u0393-orbit.\n\u0003\nRemark 64. In terms of twin root data (or, equivalently, of RGD-systems), the group \u2206\nof 2.1 is the unipotent radical of the negative parabolic subgroup \u0393, and the decomposition\n\u0393 = \u03930 \u22c9 \u2206 is a Levi decomposition [Rem02b, 6.2.2]. The fundamental domain F of Lemma\n35 is the union of the level-increasing rays from v+ : it is the infinite star St\u221e (v+ ) defined\npurely in terms of codistance in 3.1.\nRecall that two subgroups of a given group are commensurable if they share a finite index\nsubgroup.\nLemma 65. With the same notation as above, we have:\n(i) For any two points x, x\u2032 \u2208 T\u2212 , the groups StabA (x) and StabA (x\u2032 ) are commensurable.\n(ii) For any point x \u2208 T\u2212 , we have A = Aut(T\u00b1 , \u03b4 \u2217 ) < C(\u0393).\n(iii) The group C(\u0393) acts transitively on geodesics of given length and type in T+ , and it\nacts transitively on geodesics of given length if T+ has a type-exchanging automorphism.\nProof. For any x \u2208 T\u2212 , we can choose an edge E whose closure contains v, and in this\ncase we have: StabA\u25e6 (E) <f.i. StabA (x). Therefore, in order to prove (i) it is enough to\nconsider the case when x and x\u2032 both belong to the interior of an edge, say E for x and E \u2032\nfor x\u2032 . Let y (resp. y \u2032 ) be the midpoint of E (resp. E \u2032 ), and let \u03b4 be the distance between\ny and y \u2032 . Let g be an arbitrary automorphism of T+ stabilizing the edge E. Then g.y \u2032 is\nat distance \u03b4 from y and when g is type-preserving, the geodesic from y to g.y \u2032 leaves E\nthrough the vertex through which the geodesic from y to y \u2032 leaves E. Using root groups for\nroots containing E, we see for any g \u2208 StabG\u25e6 (E), the edge g.E \u2032 is a Stab\u039b (E)-transform of\n\u2032\n\u2032\nE \u2032 . Since T\u2212 is locally finite, we have a finite set\n\u0001 .E with\nFmof such edges, say h1 .E , ... \u2032hN\nh1 , ... hN \u2208 Stab\u039b (E). Therefore StabG\u25e6 (E) = j=1 hj StabG\u25e6 (E) \u2229 StabG\u25e6 (E ) , so that\nStabA\u25e6 (E) \u2229 StabA\u25e6 (E \u2032 ) <f.i. StabA\u25e6 (E). Switching x and x\u2032 and using the first remark, we\nobtain (i). Moreover (ii) follows from (i) since gStabG (x)g \u22121 = StabG (g.x) for any g \u2208 G.\nThe subgroup \u039b already enjoys the transitivity property of the first assertion of (iii) (this is\ntrue in the general twin building case [Abr97, \u00a72, p.28]), and the second assertion is easily\ndeduced from the first one.\n\u0003\nWe can finally turn to the proof of our second main result.\nProof of Theorem 7. We choose (T\u00b1 , \u03b4 \u2217 ) a thick locally finite Moufang twin tree satisfying\n(Comm), and go on using the notation of the previous two results. By Proposition 63 (iv),\nthe lattice \u0393 is of directly split Nagao type. The closure group C(\u0393) contains C(\u0393) \u2229 L,\nwhich is equal to L by Theorem 4. But C(\u0393) also contains \u039b, in which many elements do\nnot preserve the level function l. To see this, we note that by Proposition 63 (v) we have:\nl(x) = \u03b4 \u2217 (v\u2212 , x) and l(g.x) = \u03b4 \u2217 (g \u22121 .v\u2212 , x) for any x \u2208 V T+ and any g \u2208 A. In order to have\nl(x) 6= l(g.x), it is enough to make x := v+ and to pick an element n \u2208 N\u039b (L\u00b1 ) lifting a\nreflection in a vertex xj with j 6= 0 (which always exists e.g. according to [Abr97, \u00a72, Lemma\n\n\fCOMMENSURATORS OF SOME NON-UNIFORM TREE LATTICES AND MOUFANG TWIN TREES 21\n\n4 (ii)]). Finally it remains to apply Proposition 20 to the group F = C(\u0393), which contains\nL \u222a \u039b.\n\u0003\n3.4. Examples. Let us now give examples of Moufang twin trees from the most familiar\nto the most exotic ones. We first note that according to M. Ronan and J. Tits [RT99,\nCorollary 8.2], a thick semihomogeneous tree whose set of vertices has cardinality \u03b1, belongs\nto 2\u03b1 isomorphism classes of twinnings, among which most of them have no automorphism.\nThe examples below are all required to be Moufang (in particular, have big automorphism\ngroups).\nExample 66. There is a detailed study of \u039b = PSL2 (Fq [t, t\u22121 ]) in [RT94, \u00a72]. Let M be a\nrank 2 free \u0001Fq [t, t\u22121 ]-lattice with\n\u0001 basis {u; v}, and let T+ and T\u2212 be the Bruhat-Tits trees of\n\u22121\nSL2 Fq ((t)) and SL2 Fq ((t )) , respectively [Ser77, II.1]. The vertices in T+ , resp. in T\u2212 ,\nare the homothety classes of Fq [[t]]-lattices, resp. of Fq [[t\u22121 ]]-lattices, in the vector space\nM \u2297Fq [t,t\u22121 ] Fq ((t)), resp. in M \u2297Fq [t,t\u22121 ] Fq ((t\u22121 )). The codistance is defined in [RT94, Lemma\n2.1]. A useful subset of vertices in T+ is given by the homothety classes of the lattices\nFq [[t]]u \u2295 Fq [[t]]tj v for j \u2208 Z, and similarly in T\u2212 replacing t by t\u22121 . The convex hull of these\nvertices in T+ is a geodesic L+ , and together with the similar convex hull L\u2212 in T\u2212 , they\nform a twin apartment L. The pointwise fixator H of L\u00b1 is the finite subgroup of diagonal\n\u22121\nmatrices with coefficients in F\u00d7\nq . The Nagao lattice \u0393 = PSL2 (Fq [t ]) lies in \u039b and the\nlatter group acts edge-transitively\non each tree. It can actually be proved by hand that for\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1 \u03bb.td\neach d \u2208 Z, the group {\n: \u03bb \u2208 Fq } \u2243 (Fq , +) is the root group attached to the\n0\n1\nroot ad defined as the convex hull of the homothety classes of the lattices Fq [[t]]u \u2295 Fq [[t]]tj v\nfor j \u2265 d. The union of these root groups when d ranges over Z is the unipotent radical of\nthe upper triangular Borel subgroup, and condition (Comm) holds because this unipotent\ngroup is abelian.\nExample 67. Split Kac-Moody groups of rank two: these groups are defined by generators\nand relations in full generality in [Tit87]. The datum needed to define such a group roughly\nconsists in a generalized Cartan matrix A and a groundfield K. The rank 2 condition says\nthat the matrix is 2 \u00d7 2, the size 2 corresponding to the number of generators of the Weyl\ngroup. The diagonal entries are equal to 2, and one must require that the product of the\noff-diagonal entries be \u2265 4 so that the Weyl group of the building is infinite (dihedral). Each\nof the off-diagonal coefficients is negative, and the group satisfies the assumption (Comm)\nif and only if both entries are \u2264 \u22122. This follows from the computation of commutator\nrelations between root groups due, up to signs, to J. Morita [Mor88, \u00a73, example 6]. Note\nthat apart from the density of the commensurator for the rank 2 case, many other arguments\nsupporting the analogy between (parabolic subgroups of) Kac-Moody groups over finite fields\nand arithmetic groups over function fields are given in [Rem02a].\nExample 68. Twisted Kac-Moody groups are defined in [Rem02b, Part II, \u00a711]. They are\ngroups consisting of fixed points in a split Kac-Moody group, for a suitable Galois action. The\nrank 2 condition refers to the number of generators in the Weyl group. A classical example is\nprovided by the unitary group SU3 (Fq [t, t\u22121 ]), whose twinned trees are semihomogeneous of\nvalencies 1 + q and 1 + q 3 [Rem03, \u00a73.5]. The unipotent radicals of Borel subgroups of SU(3)\nover Fq ((t)) or Fq ((t\u22121 )) are not abelian but only metabelian: SU3 (Fq [t, t\u22121 ]) doesn't satisfy\n(Comm). The example of a semihomogeneous Moufang twin tree whose corresponding group\n\n\f22\n\nPETER ABRAMENKO AND BERTRAND R\u00c9MY\n\n\u039b satisfies (Comm) is given for instance in [Rem02b, 13.3]. The twisted group is a subgroup\nof rational points in a Kac-Moody group naturally acting on buildings whose apartments are\ntilings of the hyperbolic plane.\nExample 69. A general construction of Moufang twin trees is given in [Tit90, \u00a79]. Its\nstarting point are two abstract root group data of rank 1, and the classification of the latter\nstructure is known in the finite case. As Tits showed, starting with this data, it is always\npossible to construct a Moufang twin tree satisfying our Condition (Comm) and having as\nroot groups (up to isomorphism) those occurring in the original root group data of rank 1.\nAn easy way to produce non\u2013classical locally finite Moufang twin trees by this method was\npointed out by Sh. Mozes to the second author. Taking the affine group F\u00d7\nl \u22c9 Fl (l is any\nprime power) acting on the affine line Fl , we obtain what Tits calls a Moufang set and hence\na root group data of rank 1. We take two copies of this, and then J. Tits' method provides\nhomogeneous Moufang twin trees with root groups isomorphic to F\u00d7\nl . This cannot occur,\nat least if l \u2212 1 is not itself a prime power, for Bruhat-Tits or Kac-Moody trees since in the\nlatter cases the valencies are cardinalities of projective lines.\nTherefore, for instance with l = 7, we obtain a non-uniform tree lattice of directly split Nagao\ntype for a regular tree of valency 7. In the latter case, the root groups are all isomorphic\nto F\u00d7\n7 \u2243 Z/2 \u00d7 Z/3. Let us use the notation of the previous subsection, in particular the\nT+ -lattice \u0393 is the parabolic subgroup of \u039b fixing a negative vertex v\u2212 of (T\u00b1 , \u03b4 \u2217 ). The\nsubgroup H of \u0393 generated by the root groups indexed by the negative roots containing a\ngiven geodesic subray of L\u2212 emanating from v\u2212 , is isomorphic to the direct sum of these\nroot groups. Taking the 2-torsion (resp. 3-torsion) part of H and arguing as in [Rem02a,\nTheorem 5], we conclude that H, hence \u0393, cannot be linear over any field. In other words, we\nhave obtained a group inclusion \u0393 < G where the tree-lattice \u0393 is non-linear but arithmetic\nin a generalized sense, whereas the classical Nagao lattice is obviously linear. Of course,\nthe construction works with any prime power l such that l \u2212 1 admits two different prime\ndivisors.\nExample 70. In J. Tits' construction of the previous example, the starting point is a pair\nof two root group data. In the case where each root group datum comes from a PSL2 -action\non a projective line, a down-to-earth construction is made in [RR02, \u00a72]. This is enough\nto produce strictly more general Moufang twin trees than those coming from Kac-Moody\ngroups since there may be two groundfields (one for each type of vertex). The choices of\nthe characteristics of the ground fields can be made so that the argument of the second\nparagraph of the previous example enables to obtain again hh non-linear but arithmetic ii treelattices. At last, the concrete viewpoint allows to generalize the construction to the case of\nMoufang twin buildings with a Weyl group of arbitrarily large rank, leading to generalized\nKac-Moody groups with strong non-linearity properties acting on two-dimensional buildings\n[RR02, Theorem 4.A].\nReferences\n[Abr97]\n[BL01]\n[BM96]\n\nP.
