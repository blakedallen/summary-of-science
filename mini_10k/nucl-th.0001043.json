Powerful computers and special algorithms for diagonalizing large matrices has allowed systematic studies of nuclei\nof the sd-shell [4] and pf-shell up to A = 56 [5]. New methods for solving large\nscale shell-model problems in medium mass nuclei have also been developed\n[6]. A shell-model description of heavy nuclei requires further assumptions that\ninclude a systematic and proper truncation of the model space [1].\nIn light deformed nuclei the dominance of the quadrupole-quadrupole interaction led to the introduction of the SU(3) shell model [7], and with it a very\nnatural means to truncate large model spaces. Although realistic interactions\nmix different irreducible representations (irreps), the ground state wave function of well-deformed light nuclei normally consists of only a few SU(3) irreps\n[8, 9, 10, 11]. The strong spin-orbit interaction renders the usual SU(3) scheme\nuseless in heavy nuclei, but at the same time pseudo-spin emerges as a good\nsymmetry [12, 13, 14].\nPseudo-spin symmetry refers to the experimental fact that single-particle\norbitals with j = l \u2212 1/2 and j = (l \u2212 2) + 1/2 in the shell \u03b7 lie very close\nin energy and can therefore be labeled as pseudo spin doublets with quantum\nnumbers j\u0303 = j, \u03b7\u0303 = \u03b7 \u2212 1 and l\u0303 = l \u2212 1. The origin of this symmetry has been\ntraced back to the relativistic Dirac equation [15, 16, 17]. The pseudo SU(3)\nmodel capitalizes on the existence of pseudo-spin symmetry.\nIn the simplest version of the pseudo SU(3) model, the intruder level with\nopposite parity in each major shell is removed from active consideration and\npseudo-orbital and pseudo-spin angular momentum are assigned to the remaining single-particle states. The coupling of a deformed rigid-rotor core with one\nextra particle in a pseudo SU(3) orbital has been used to describe rotational\nbands and electromagnetic properties of heavy odd-mass nuclei [18] and identical normal and superdeformed bands [19].\nA fully microscopic description of low-energy bands in even-even nuclei has\nbeen developed using the pseudo SU(3) model. The first applications used the\npseudo SU(3) as a dynamical symmetry, with a single SU(3) irrep describing\nthe whole yrast band up to backbending [20]. A comparison of quantum rotor\nand microscopic SU(3) states [21] provided a classification of the SU(3) irreps in\nterms of their transformation properties under \u03c0 rotations in the intrinsic frame\n[22] and led to the construction of a K 2 operator which plays a crucial role in\nthe description of the gamma band [23].\nOn the computational side, the development of a computer code to calculate reduced matrix elements of physical operators between different SU(3)\nirreps [24] represented a breakthrough in the development of the pseudo SU(3)\nmodel. For example, with this code it is possible to include pairing, which is\nan SU(3) symmetry breaking interaction, in the Hamiltonian and exhibit its\nclose relationship with triaxiality [25, 26]. Full-space calculations in the pf-shell\n[27] in an SU(3) basis [11] show that for a description of the low-energy spectra of deformed nuclei the Hilbert space can be truncated to leading irreps of\n2\n\n\fthe quadrupole-quadrupole and spin-orbit (or pseudo spin-orbit) interactions.\nHowever, the inclusion of a pairing-type interaction is essential for a correct\ndescription of moments of inertia in such a truncated space.\nOnce a basic understanding of this overall structure was achieved, a powerful\nshell-model theory for a description of normal parity states in heavy deformed\nnuclei emerged. For example, the low-energy spectra of many Gd and Dy isotopes, their B(E2) and B(M1) transitions strengths for both their scissors and\ntwist modes [28] and their fragmentation were successfully described with a\nrealistic Hamiltonian [29].\nIn the present letter we introduce a refined version of the pseudo SU(3)\nformalism which uses a realistic Hamiltonian with single-particle energies plus\nquadrupole-quadrupole and monopole pairing inteactions with strengths taken\nfrom known systematics. The model is applied to three odd-mass rare earth\nnuclei: 159 Eu, 159 Tb and 159 Dy. The results represent a full implementation of\nthe very ambitious program implied in first applications of the pseudo SU(3)\nmodel to odd-mass nuclei performed nearly thirty years ago [14].\nMany-particle states of n\u03b1 active nucleons in a given normal parity shell \u03b7\u03b1 ,\n\u03b1 = \u03bd or \u03c0, can be classified by the following chains of groups:\nN\n\n{f \u0303\u03b1 }\n\n{1n\u03b1 }\nU (\u03a9N\n\u03b1)\n\n\u2283\n\nU (\u03a9N\n\u03b1 /2)\n\n{f\u03b1 } \u03b3\u03b1 (\u03bb\u03b1 , \u03bc\u03b1 ) S\u0303\u03b1 K\u03b1\n\u00d7 U (2) \u2283 SU (3) \u00d7 SU (2) \u2283\nL\u0303\u03b1\nJ\u03b1N\nSO(3) \u00d7 SU (2) \u2283 SUJ (2),\n\n(1)\n\nwhere above each group the quantum numbers that characterize its irreps are\ngiven and \u03b3\u03b1 and K\u03b1 are multiplicity labels of the indicated reductions.\nThe most important configurations are those with highest spatial symmetry\n[20, 11]. This implies that S\u0303\u03c0,\u03bd = 0 or 1/2, that is, only configurations with\npseudo spin zero for even number of nucleons and 1/2 for odd number of nucleons\nare taken into account.\nWe will describe 159 Tb as a first example. It has 15 protons and 12 neutrons\nin the 50-82 and 82-126 shells, respectively. The number of nucleons in normal\n(N) and abnormal (A) parity orbitals is determined by filling the Nilsson levels\nwith a pair of particles for \u03b2 \u223c 0.25 in order of increasing energy. This gives\nnN\n\u03c0 = 9,\n\nnA\n\u03c0 = 6,\n\nnN\n\u03bd = 8,\n\nnA\n\u03bd = 4\n\n(2)\n\nAfter decoupling the pseudospin in Eq. (1) we get {f \u0303\u03c0 } = {24 1}, {f \u0303\u03bd } = {24 }\nwith S\u0303\u03c0 = 1/2 and S\u0303\u03bd = 0. Table I lists the 15 pseudo SU(3) irreps, with the\nlargest value of the Casimir operator C2 , which were used in this calculation.\nTable I\n3\n\n\fThe Hamiltonian contains spherical Nilsson single-particle terms for protons and neutrons (Hsp,\u03c0[\u03bd] ), the quadrupole-quadrupole (Q\u0303 * Q\u0303) and pairing\n(Hpair,\u03c0[\u03bd] ) interactions as well as three 'rotor-like' terms which are diagonal in\nthe SU(3) basis:\n\nH\n\n=\n\n1\n\u03c7 Q\u0303 * Q\u0303 \u2212 G\u03c0 Hpair,\u03c0\n2\n+ a KJ2 + b J 2 + Aasym C\u03032 .\n\nHsp,\u03c0 + Hsp,\u03bd \u2212\n\u2212 G\u03bd Hpair,\u03bd\n\n(3)\n\nThe term proportional to KJ2 breaks the SU(3) degeneracy of the different K\nbands [23], the J 2 term represents a small correction to fine tune the moment of\ninertia, and the last C\u03032 term is introduced to distinguish between SU(3) irreps\nwith \u03bb and \u03bc both even from the others with one or both odd [22].\nThe Nilsson single-particle energies as well as the pairing and quadrupolequadrupole interaction strengths were taken from systematics [30, 31]; only a\nand b were used for fitting. Parameter values are listed in Table II and are\nconsistent with those used in the description of neighboring even-even nuclei\n[29].\nTable II\nFigure 1(a) shows the calculated and experimental [32] K = 23 , 52 and 21\nbands for 159 Tb. The agreement between theory and experiment is in general\nexcellent. The model predicts a continuation of the K = 25 band and overemphasizes staggering in the K = 12 band.\nFigure 1\nThe role played by each term in the Hamiltonian will be discussed in detail\nelsewhere [33]. In this letter we wish to emphasize that the pairing interaction\nis absolutely essential despite the strong truncation of the Hilbert space. To\nthis end we present in part (b) of Fig. 1 the low-energy spectra of 159 Tb with\nthe same Hamiltonian except that the pairing interaction has been turned off.\nIt clearly exhibits the importance of the pairing interaction in building up the\ncorrect moment of inertia: the spectra without pairing is strongly compressed.\nIt can also be seen that pairing affect the other energies in a similar way with\nan overall effect that resembles the introduction of a multiplicative factor in the\nHamiltonian. We conclude that the proposed truncation scheme is justified and\nworks as expected.\nTheoretical and experimental [32] B(E2) transition strengths between yrast\nstates in 159 Tb are shown in Table III. The E2 transition operator that was used\nis given by [20]\nQ\u03bc = e\u03c0 Q\u03c0 + e\u03bd Q\u03bd \u2248 e\u03c0\n\n\u03b7\u03bd + 1\n\u03b7\u03c0 + 1\nQ\u0303\u03c0 + e\u03bd\nQ\u0303\u03bd ,\n\u03b7\u03c0\n\u03b7\u03bd\n\n4\n\n(4)\n\n\fwith effective charges e\u03c0 = 2.3, e\u03bd = 1.3. These values are very similar to those\nused in the pseudo SU(3) description of even-even nuclei [20, 29]. They are\nlarger than those used in standard calculations of B(E2) strengths [30] due to the\npassive role assigned to nucleons in unique parity orbitals, whose contribution\nto the quadrupole moments is parametrized in this way.\nIn Figure 2 (a) we present the low-lying energy spectra of 159 Eu, including\nthe K = 52 , 23 and 21 bands built with 7 protons in the normal parity subshell\n\u03b7\u0303 = 3 and 8 neutrons in \u03b7\u0303 = 4. There is a good agreement between the\n+\nexperimental [32] and theoretical results. The model predicts a second 27 state\n3\nin the K = 2 band which is missing in the experimental spectra, as well as\nseveral other states in the excited bands.\nFigure 2\n+\n\nIt is interesting to notice that the ground state in 159 Tb is 32 while in 159 Eu\n+\nit is 52 . Reproducing this effect is one of the successes of this theory; realistic\nsingle-particle-energies are required to get this ordering correct.\nThe low energy spectra of 159 Dy is presented in Fig. 2(b). There are three\nbands, with K = 23 , 52 and 21 , respectively. As in the other cases the agreement\nbetween theory and experiment is remarkably good. In the K = 32 ground state\n\u2212\nstate is predicted to have an energy higher than the experimentally\nband the 17\n2\nobserved one. This departure of the experimental ground state band from the\nrigid rotor behavior may be related with a band crossing. The possibility of\ndescribing it by increasing the Hilbert space is under investigation. In the\n\u2212\n\u2212\nK = 12 band the 23 state lies higher than its 52 partner which contradicts the\nexperimental results. As in the other cases, the model predicts several excited\nlevels that are as yet undetected.\nIt has been shown that normal parity bands in odd-mass heavy deformed\nnuclei can be described quantitatively using the pseudo SU(3) model. Only a\nfew representations with largest C2 values and pseudo spin 0 or 1/2 are needed.\nThe Hamiltonian uses Nilsson single-particle energies, quadrupole-quadrupole\nand pairing interactions with strengths fixed by systematics, and three small\nrotor terms which with the others yield excellent results for energies and B(E2)\nvalues in A=159 nuclei.\nThis work exhibits the usefulness of the pseudo SU(3) model as a shell model,\none which can be used to describe deformed rare-earth and actinide isotopes by\nperforming a symmetry dictated truncation of the Hilbert space. It opens up\nthe possibility of a more detailed microscopic description of other properties of\nheavy deformed nuclei, both with even and odd protons and neutrons numbers,\nlike g-factors, M1 transitions, and beta decays.\nThis work was supported in part by Conacyt (M\u00e9xico) and the U.S. National\nScience Foundation.\n\n5\n\n\fReferences\n[1] M.
