We report the spontaneous onset of a onedimensional, incommensurate modulation of the spin system in the high-temperature\nsuperconductor YBa2Cu3O6.45 upon cooling below ~150 K, while static magnetic order is\nabsent above 2 K. The evolution of this modulation with temperature and doping parallels\nthat of the in-plane anisotropy of the resistivity, indicating an electronic nematic phase that\nis stable over a wide temperature range. The results suggest that soft spin fluctuations are a\nmicroscopic route towards electronic liquid crystals, and nematic order can coexist with\nhigh-temperature superconductivity in underdoped cuprates.\nThe electronic states near the Fermi level of high-temperature superconductors derive from the\nhybridized d- and p-orbitals of copper and oxygen ions in a square-planar network. At a doping\nlevel of 1/8 hole per Cu ion, experimental work on a specific superconducting cuprate family,\n(La,Nd)2-x(Sr,Ba)xCuO4 (La214), has shown that the two-dimensional electron system in the\nCuO2 layers can support a state with uniaxial spin (1\u20133) and charge (1,4,5) order (\"stripes\").\nStatic stripe order implies that both translational and rotational symmetries of the copper-oxide\nsquare lattice are spontaneously broken. More unusual \"electronic liquid crystal\" states (6) that\nbreak the rotational symmetry of the lattice while at least partially preserving its translational\nsymmetry can arise from quantum fluctuations of stripes(6\u20138), or from Fermi surface instabilities\n(9\u201311). Electronic nematic states have recently been discovered in semiconductor\nheterostructures (12) and in the bulk transition metal oxide Sr3Ru2O7 (13). In both cases,\nhowever, they are stable only at milli-Kelvin temperatures and in high magnetic fields, and have\nthus far only been probed by transport measurements. We use neutron scattering to address the\nrole of magnetic degrees of freedom in driving the formation of electronic liquid crystals, and to\nexplore the presence of liquid-crystalline order in the cuprates.\nIn the prior experiments on semiconductor heterostructures and on Sr3Ru2O7, the nematic\ndirector was aligned by external magnetic fields, resulting in a strong macroscopic anisotropy of\n1\n\n\fthe current flow (12,13), analogous to the alignment of nematic domains in conventional liquid\ncrystals by electric fields or confining walls. In the cuprates, subtle crystallographic distortions\ncan serve as aligning fields for symmetry-broken electronic phases. They reduce the fourfold\nrotational symmetry of the CuO2 layer to a twofold rotational or mirror symmetry by introducing\na slight (~1%) difference between the in-plane lattice parameters. In stripe-ordered La214, the\nstripe domains in every CuO2 layer are aligned by such a twofold axis, but the layers are stacked\nin such a way that the global crystal symmetry is tetragonal, and no macroscopic anisotropy is\nobserved (1). The situation is more favorable in metallic YBa2Cu3O6+x (Y123), where a\nmacroscopic orthorhombic crystal structure is stabilized by one-dimensional CuO chains lying\nbetween the CuO2 bilayers (see the SOM for Supporting Text (14)). Indeed, an unexpectedly\nlarge, temperature and doping dependent in-plane anisotropy of the resistivity has been reported\nfor this material (15). While this constitutes possible evidence of nematic order (7,15), clear\nsignatures of an isotropic-to-nematic transition are not apparent in the transport data.\nA determination of the spin-spin correlation function by magnetic neutron scattering has the\npotential to build a more robust case for nematic order, and to elucidate the underlying\nmicroscopic mechanisms. Our sample is a large array of untwined YBa2Cu3O6.45 single crystals\nwith superconducting transition temperature Tc = 35 K (14,16). In this work we show only\nmagnetic excitations that are odd under the exchange of the two layers within a CuO2 bilayer\n(14,17). Figures 1A\u2013C provide an overview of the magnetic spectrum along the two\nperpendicular in-plane axes a* and b* at a temperature of 5 K. As previously observed for Y123\nsamples at similar doping levels (17\u201320), the magnetic intensity is concentrated around the inplane wave vector QAF = (\u03c0/a, \u03c0/b) (the propagation vector of the antiferromagnetic state in\nundoped Y123), and the spectrum is nearly gapless (Fig. 3C). The new aspect uncovered by the\nexperiments on twin-free samples presented here is the in-plane anisotropy of the spectrum,\nwhich exhibits an unusual evolution with energy and temperature. Whereas at high excitation\nenergies, E, the spectrum is isotropic (Fig. 1C), maps of the magnetic spectral weight for\nE < 15 meV reveal a pronounced anisotropy that increases with decreasing energy (Fig. 1A, B).\nThis anisotropy could not be recognized in prior work due to crystal twinning (Fig. 1D). Cuts\nthrough the spectrum with high instrumental resolution (Fig. 1E, F) reveal that the anisotropic\nintensity distribution is generated by two incommensurate peaks symmetrically displaced from\nQAF along a*, while along b* the distribution is commensurate.\nFigure 2 shows the temperature dependence of constant-energy cuts along the two highsymmetry axes. While the isotropic intensity distribution at high E is temperature-independent,\nthe anisotropy at low E is strongly reduced with increasing temperature. Fits of the profiles to\ntwo Gaussians centered at Q = (\u03c0/a \u00b1 \u03b4, \u03c0/b) yield excellent descriptions of the data at all\ntemperatures (lines in Figs. 1E and 2). The results of the fits for E = 3 meV are plotted in Fig. 3.\nThe intrinsic half-widths-at-half-maximum along a* and b*, \u03bea\u20131 and \u03beb\u20131 (extracted from the\nGaussian peaks after a correction for the instrumental resolution), are nearly identical and weakly\ntemperature dependent. The zero-temperature offset suggests that magnetic long-range order is\nabsent, reflecting the influence of magnetic quantum fluctuations, low-energy charge fluctuations\nand/or disorder.\nThe incommensurability \u03b4 exhibits an order-parameter-like behavior with an onset temperature\n2\n\n\f~ 150 K (Fig. 3A). Although \u03b4 can no longer be accurately determined (nor is it physically\nmeaningful) once it becomes smaller than \u03bea\u20131 (shaded area in Fig. 3A), this behavior indicates\nan underlying phase transition where \u03b4 \u2192 0. At the same temperature, the Q-integrated spin\nsusceptibility \u03c7 \u0301 \u0301(\u03c9) exhibits a strong upturn (Fig. 3B), which is also reminiscent of a broadened\nphase transition. A rounding of the singularities related to a phase transition is generally\nexpected because the spin system is probed at nonzero energy, but additional contributions can\narise from disorder and/or the orthorhombic distortion of the crystal structure.\nOrdinary magnetic phase transitions are associated with the formation of static magnetic\nmoments. We have performed zero-field muon-spin-relaxation (\u03bcSR) experiments at the \u03c0m3\nbeamline at the Paul-Scherrer-Institut in Villigen (CH), capable of routinely detecting static or\nslowly fluctuating electronic moments of order 0.01 \u03bcB per lattice site. Figure 4A shows that at\ntemperatures above 10 K, the relaxation of muon spins implanted into our samples is entirely\ndetermined by nuclear spins. In agreement with prior work (21), an additional contribution to the\n\u03bcSR signal from low-energy electronic spin excitations is seen below 10 K. Manifestations of\nelectronic magnetic moments that are static on the microsecond time scale probed by the muons\nare discernible only in the decay profiles below ~ 2 K.\nInformation about the spatial structure of these low-energy spin correlations was obtained by\nadditional neutron scattering measurements with a spectrometer nominally set for zero energy\ntransfer. Due to the finite energy resolution, spin fluctuations with energies below the\ninstrumental resolution width of ~ 0.2 meV are probed in this \"quasi-elastic\" configuration.\nRepresentative data (Fig. 4B) show that the incommensurability of the quasi-elastic profile as\nwell as its width \u03bea\u20131 are nearly identical to those of the low-energy inelastic data plotted in\nFig. 3A; \u03beb\u20131 is somewhat smaller. The quasi-elastic intensity exhibits a significant upturn below\n30 K. These data fit well into the \"spin freezing\" phenomenology of deeply underdoped cuprates\n(20\u201324). The characteristic frequency of electronic spin fluctuations is reduced with decreasing\ntemperature; this is directly apparent in the inelastic neutron scattering data of Fig. 3C. Upon\nfurther cooling, the spin system gradually freezes into an ensemble of slowly fluctuating, finitesized domains. The characteristic fluctuation rate of these domains progressively enters the\nfrequency windows of quasi-elastic neutron scattering (20,22,23), \u03bcSR (21,22), and nuclear\nmagnetic resonance (24) methods.\nThe results demonstrate that the spin correlations within the fluctuating domains are\nincommensurate. As the signal derives entirely from the CuO2 planes (14), coupling between\nspins in the planes and the CuO chains can be ruled out as a substantial driving force of these\ncorrelations. Thus, our data demonstrate that the spin system in the CuO2 planes of strongly\nunderdoped Y123 becomes inherently unstable towards the formation of a uniaxial, slowly\nfluctuating spin texture at a critical temperature of ~ 150 K. The small (< 1%) orthorhombic\ndistortion of the crystal structure serves as an aligning field for the incommensurate domains and\nleads to the large anisotropy of the neutron scattering pattern below 150 K. This scenario is also\nconsistent with the observation of local uniaxial charge domains in the spin-glass state of other\nhigh temperature superconductors by scanning tunneling spectroscopy (25).\nThe relationship between the magnetic dynamics and the charge transport properties of\n3\n\n\fYBa2Cu3O6.45 can be discussed in the context of theoretical proposals for electronic nematic\norder. While in-plane anisotropies of both the spin fluctuation spectrum and the electrical\nresistivity in the absence of spin and charge order are generic features of nematic states in\ntheoretical models of quasi-two-dimensional electron systems (10,11), nematic order has thus far\nbeen diagnosed solely on the basis of the spontaneous onset of anisotropic resistivity (12,13). In\nY123, the case for nematicity is harder to make based on transport alone, because the aligning\nfield is not tunable like the magnetic fields used in Refs. (12,13). The resistivity is thus\nanisotropic at all temperatures, and the putative isotropic-to-nematic transition is inevitably\nbroadened. The pronounced enhancement of the in-plane resistivity ratio, \u03c1a/\u03c1b, below ~ 200 K\n(inset in Fig. 3B) is, however, suggestive of an underlying phase transition (15). The strikingly\nsimilar temperature dependence of the spectral weight of the anisotropic low-energy spin\nfluctuations (Fig. 3B) confirms this interpretation. In addition, both quantities exhibit a parallel\nevolution with energy and doping: Optical conductivity measurements on Y123 crystals with\ndoping levels similar to ours indicate that the charge transport anisotropy is strongly reduced at\nexcitation energies above ~ 20 meV (26), in good agreement with the crossover to isotropic spin\nfluctuations we observe. In more highly doped Y123 (where the orthorhombic distortion is\nenhanced), \u03c1a/\u03c1b is reduced and much less temperature dependent (15), while the spectral weight\nof the low-energy collective spin excitations is strongly diminished (17\u201319,27\u201329). Although\nlow-energy spin excitations are not entirely suppressed, this phenomenon has been termed a\n\"spin-gap\". We note that the dispersion and in-plane geometry of the excitations at energies\nexceeding the spin gap of YBa2Cu3O6+x (x \u2265 0.5) above Tc bear some resemblance to the lowenergy excitations of YBa2Cu3O6.45 (19,28,29). This suggests the presence of a quantum phase\ntransition at x ~ 0.5, where nematic order disappears and a gap opens up in the spin fluctuation\nspectrum. While the spin fluctuations above the gap remain characteristic of the ordered phase\nnearby, the dc-transport properties appear to be primarily controlled by interactions with lowenergy excitations.\nThe energy and momentum dependence of the spin excitations we have observed helps to\ndevelop a microscopic description of the nematic state, and to discriminate between different\ntheoretical descriptions of the coupling between spin and charge excitations in the cuprates.\nSpecifically, the data of Fig. 3A are incompatible with theories according to which the resistivity\nanisotropy is controlled by an anisotropic spin-spin correlation length (30). Rather, the data\nindicate a correspondence between the upturn in \u03c1a/\u03c1b and the onset of the incommensurate\nmodulation of the spin system. Incommensurate peaks in the magnetic neutron scattering pattern\ncan arise either from a longitudinal modulation, where the magnetic moments are collinear but\ntheir amplitude is spatially modulated, or from a transverse modulation, where the moment\ndirection varies but the amplitude remains constant. Our data are compatible with slow\nfluctuations characteristic of either type of modulation. Spin-amplitude modulated states\nnaturally go along with a modulation of the charge carrier density, and the carrier mobilities\nalong and perpendicular to the modulation axis are generally expected to be different (7). It has\nalso been shown that a transverse modulation with spiral spin correlations can lead to anisotropic\nhopping transport in weakly doped cuprates with diverging low-temperature resistivity (31).\nFurther work is required to assess whether this mechanism can be generalized to metallic\nelectron systems such as the one in YBa2Cu3O6.45. Finally, we note that the magnitude of \u03b4 in\nYBa2Cu3O6.45 is incompatible (16,18) with the Yamada-plot (32), that is, the \u03b4-versus-x relation\n4\n\n\fthat holds generally for La214: This relation stipulates an incommensurability \u03b4 ~ 0.085 r.l.u. for\nour doping level of 0.085 holes per Cu atom, while we observe \u03b4 to saturate at ~ 0.045 r.l.u. at\nthe lowest energies and temperatures. Besides, a spontaneous onset of the incommensurability\nhas thus far not been observed in this cuprate family (2).\nThe spin dynamics of YBa2Cu3O6.45 and its close correspondence with the charge transport\nproperties of this material provide strong evidence of a cooperative transition to an electronic\nnematic phase at a temperature that is about two orders of magnitude higher than the onset of\nstatic magnetic order. In the light of prior work on La214 (33), we expect the quasi-static,\nincommensurate magnetic order observed here to be enhanced by a magnetic field perpendicular\nto the CuO2 planes, with possibly important consequences for the interpretation of the Fermi\nsurface pockets inferred from recent high-field quantum oscillation measurements on Y123\ncrystals with doping levels similar to ours (34,35).\nAcknowledgements: Part of this work is based on experiments performed at the Swiss muon\nsource S\u03bcS, Paul Scherrer Institute, Villigen, Switzerland.

Geometry of the spin excitations around QAF at L = 1.7 r.l.u. in the a-b plane at T = 5 K.\n(A\u2013C) Intensity maps of the spin-excitation spectrum at 3, 7 and 50 meV, respectively,\nassembled from triple-axis scans. The a*-and b*-directions are indicated in panel A. The scale is\nin arbitrary units and the wave vector is in reciprocal lattice units (r.l.u.), see also the SOM (14).\nThe wave vector of the scattered neutrons, kf, was fixed to 2.66 \u00c5-1 in A,B and to 4.1 \u00c5-1 in C.\nThe crossings of black lines represent measured data points. All scans were corrected for a Qlinear background. (D) Color map of the intensity at 3 meV, as it would be observed in a crystal\nconsisting of two perpendicular twin domains with equal population. The representation was\nobtained by transposing the map in A and superposing it with the original map. (E,F) Scans\nalong a* and b* through QAF. The resolution was enhanced as compared to A\u2013D by working with\nkf = 1.55 \u00c5-1. Solid lines represent fits with one (F) or two (E) Gaussians to the data. A linear\nbackground was subtracted.\n\nFig. 2. Temperature evolution of the a-b\nanisotropy of the spin correlations. Full squares\nand empty circles represent data points\nmeasured at fixed K along a* and at fixed H\nalong b*, respectively. (A\u2013C) E = 3 meV, (D\u2013\nF) E = 7 meV, (G\u2013I) E = 25 meV. The\nmeasurements were performed at T = 5 K (A,\nD, G), T = 40 K (B, E, H) and T = 100 K (C, F,\nI). The final wave vector kf was fixed to 2.66 .\n\u00c5\u20131. All scans are normalized to unity in order\nto allow a better comparison of the scan\nprofiles. Solid lines represent the results of fits\nwith one or two Gaussians. A linear background\nwas subtracted.\n7\n\n\fFig. 3. Temperature and energy evolution of parameters\ncharacterizing the spin excitation spectrum. The\nparameters are the results of fits to the raw data,\ncorrected for the instrumental resolution. (A)\nIncommensurability \u03b4 (red symbols), half-width-at-halfmaximum of the incommensurate peaks along a* (\u03bea\u20131,\nblack symbols) and along b* (\u03beb\u20131, open blue symbols)\nin reciprocal lattice units. The upper border of the\nshaded area follows \u03bea\u20131. The \u03be\u20131-axis is scaled to twice\nthe value of the \u03b4-axis, hence \u03b4-points lying inside the\nshaded area indicate an IC peak separation below \u03bea\u20131.\n(B) Imaginary part of the Q-integrated spin\nsusceptibility \u03c7 \u0301 \u0301(\u03c9) at 3 meV.

(C) Energy evolution of \u03c7 \u0301 \u0301(\u03c9) at T = 5,\n40, 100, and 290 K. In all panels, the error bars were\nestimated from the fits. The lines are guide to the eye.\n\nFig. 4. Measurements of the quasi-elastic\nmagnetic response. (A) Zero field muon-spinrelaxation data taken at T = 1.5, 2.75, 3.5, 5, 7,\nand 30 K. Solid lines show the results of fits to\na relaxation function that consists of the\nproduct of a stretched exponential and a KuboToyabe function, which account for the\ncontribution of the electronic and nuclear\nmagnetic moments, respectively. (B,C)\nNeutron scattering scans along a* at fixed\nK = \u20130.5 and along b* at fixed H = 0.54, with a\nnominal energy transfer of 0 meV. The\ndifference between the intensities at 5 K and\n40 K is shown in arbitrary units and kf was\nfixed to 1.48 \u00c5\u20131. Solid lines represent fits with\none (C) or two (B) Gaussians to the data. A\nlinear background was subtracted.\n8\n\n\fMaterials and Methods\nSample preparation\nAs-grown YBa2Cu3O6+x samples are twinned, i.e. they consist of equal proportions of twin\ndomains with mutually perpendicular orientation of the in-plane axes a and b. To probe the inplane anisotropy of the spin correlations, a large, almost twin-free (domain population ratio >\n92%) sample array with a mosaicity ~ 1\u00b0 was prepared consisting of ~ 100 crystals with a total\nmass of ~ 2 g. All crystals were characterized by magnetometry and were found to exhibit\nsuperconducting transition temperatures Tc = 35 K with transition widths of 2\u20133 K, testifying to\ntheir high quality. The lattice parameters, a = 3.8388 \u00c5, b = 3.8747 \u00c5, and c = 11.761 \u00c5,\ncorrespond to the chemical composition YBa2Cu3O6.45 and a hole concentration of 0.085 \u00b1 0.01\nper copper ion (S1), in agreement with the superconducting transition temperature.\nFor the neutron scattering experiments the crystals were arranged on a thin aluminum plate, see\nfig. S1. Each crystal was aligned individually, using an X-ray Laue device. The resulting crystal\narray has a mosaicity of ~ 1\u00b0.\n\nNeutron scattering measurements\nThe neutron measurements were carried out at the triple-axis spectrometers IN8 and IN14\n(Institut Laue Langevin) and 4F2 (Laboratoire L\u00e9on Brillouin). Pyrolytic graphite\nmonochromators and analyzers were used. As described previously (S2,S3), scans along a* and\nb* were carried out under identical instrumental resolution conditions. No collimators were used,\nand graphite or beryllium filters extinguished higher-order contamination of the neutron beam.\nThe magnetic origin of the quasi-elastic signal was confirmed in a measurement with polarized\nneutrons. We quote the wave vector Q = (H,K,L) in reciprocal lattice units (r. l. u.) with primitive\nvectors a*, b*, and c*, where a* = 2\u03c0/a, b* = 2\u03c0/b and c* = 2\u03c0/c.\n\nMuon-spin rotation \u03bcSR measurements\nThe muon-spin rotation (\u03bcSR) measurements were carried out with the GPS setup at the \u03c0m3\nbeamline at the Paul-Scherrer-Institut in Villigen, Switzerland, which provides 100% spinpolarized muons.\n\nSupporting Text\nBilayer modulation\nThe Y123 structure consists of CuO2 bilayers separated by a layer containing CuO chains.\nMagnetic interactions within a bilayer unit split the magnetic excitations into branches that are\nodd and even under the exchange of the two layers. The excitations exhibit an L-dependent\n9\n\n\fstructure factor, and their intensity is modulated by sin2(\u03c0Ld/c) and cos2(\u03c0Ld/c), respectively,\nwhere d = 3.285 \u00c5 is the intra-bilayer spacing. In this work we show odd excitations only and\nwork at the first maximum of their structure factor, 1.7 r.l.u. Even excitations show a gap of\nabout 50 meV and do not interfere with our data (S4). In our measurements the presence of the\nsin2 intensity modulation was confirmed. In particular, the magnetic intensity is zero at L = 0\nwithin the experimental error, see Fig. S2. This implies that magnetic moments in the CuO\nchains do not contribute to the spin correlations shown here, and that the signal shown derives\nentirely from the CuO2 planes.\n\nFigures\n\nFig. S1: Photograph of the YBa2Cu3O6.45 sample used\nin this experiment. The Al-plate carrying the crystals is\nperforated to reduce the amount of Al in the neutron\nbeam, which can give rise to spurious scattering. The\nc-axis is perpendicular to the plate surface. Up to three\ncrystals are stacked on top of each other (the back side\nof the plate is similarly covered with crystals). This is\nto concentrate the sample in the middle of the beam\nand to avoid the necessity of a second Al-plate.\n\nFig. S2: Scans along a* through QAF at 3 meV (left panel) and 15 meV (right panel) at 5 K.\nBlack symbols show the intensity at the maximum of the odd bilayer structure factor (L = 1.7\nr.l.u.), while open symbols show the intensity at its minimum (L = 0). A linear background has\nbeen subtracted.\n\nReferences\nS1. R. Liang, D. A. Bonn, W. N. Hardy, Phys. Rev. B 73, 180505 (2006).\nS2. V. Hinkov et al., Nature 430, 650 (2004).\nS3. V.
