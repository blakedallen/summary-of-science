They could be easily\nderived if one starts with a Kolmogorov probability space\nP = (\u03a9, F , P)\nand a few random variables, say A(i) (\u03c9), B (j)(\u03c9). Here \u03a9 is a set of chance\nparameters \u03c9, F is a collection of subsets of \u03a9 (so called \u03c3-algebra), and P\nis a probability measure.\nThe problem arises when one puts (by Bell's recommendation) statistical\ndata collected in a few experiments into those of these inequalities which\ncould be experimentally verified. They are violated! (see e.g. [5]\u2013[7]) Physicists typically point out to such mystical things as non-locality or (and)\n\"death of realism\" to explain why experimental data does not match Bell's\ntype inequalities, [1]\u2013[4].\nHowever, we could not ignore a possible purely probabilistic source of violation of Bell's type inequalities. We recall that the use of a single probability\nspace for statistical data collected with respect to a few different experimental contexts is not a custom of probability theory. It is clear that if one goes\nagainst the rules of the well established mathematical formalism (as well as\nexperimental statistical methodology), then paradoxical conclusions might\nbe expected.\nWe recall that Andrei Nikolaevich Kolmogorov (the founder of modern\nprobability theory) emphasized that each experiment is described by its own\nprobability space, see [8]1 , see also Gnedenko [9]. Thus the use of a single\nprobability space in the derivation of Bell's type inequalities, see [1]\u2013[4] for\ndetails, was not justified. As was pointed out in [10]\u2013[20] operating with\na few probability measures (corresponding to different experiments) blocks\nthe derivation. As was recently pointed out in [16], in probability theory\n1\n\nThere is the evident matching between views of Kolmogorov and Bohr. The latter\npointed out that experimental arrangement should be taken into account.\n\n2\n\n\fsuch a problem \u2013 a possibility to realize a system of random variables on a\nsingle probability space- were studied and finally solved by Soviet probabilist\nVorobjev in the 1960s [21].\nIf one wants to use classical probability theory to describe the EPR-BohmBell experiment, it should be done properly. To be sure that paradoxical conclusions of violation of Bell's inequality are not artifacts of the misuse of the\nmathematical formalism, we should demand Weirstrassian rigorousness of\nany probabilistic description. The aim of this paper is to provide an alternative probabilistic model for the EPR-Bohm-Bell experiment2 . If one wants to\napply the classical probabilistic model, a single Kolmogorov probability space,\nthen random experiments for different settings of PBS should be unified in\na single random experiment in an intelligent way. We shall describe such an\nexperiment and we shall show that quantum (experimental) statistical data\nis harmonically combined with the classical probabilistic description. In this\npaper we shall consider the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) inequality,\nalthough results obtained here apply to any Bell-type inequality.\n\n2\n\nCHSH inequality\n\nWe recall the rigorous mathematical formulation of the CHSH inequality:\nTheorem. Let A(i) (\u03c9) and B (i) (\u03c9), i = 1, 2, be random variables taking values in [\u22121, 1] and defined on a single probability space P. Then the\nfollowing inequality holds:\n| < A(1) , B (1) > + < A(1) , B (2) > + < A(2) , B (1) > \u2212 < A(2) , B (2) > | \u2264 2.\n(1)\nThe classical correlation is defined as it is in classical probability theory:\nZ\n(i)\n(j)\n< A , B >=\nA(i) (\u03c9)B (j) (\u03c9)dP(\u03c9).\n\u03a9\n\nJ. Bell proposed the following methodology. To verify an inequality of this\ntype, one should put statistical data collected for four pairs of PBSs settings:\n\u03b811 = (\u03b81 , \u03b81\u2032 ), \u03b812 = (\u03b81 , \u03b82\u2032 ), \u03b821 = (\u03b82 , \u03b81\u2032 ), \u03b822 = (\u03b82 , \u03b82\u2032 ),\n2\n\nThe EPR-Bohm experiment was about precise correlations. Bell completed it by\ncombining statistical data collected for different experimental settings. Our point is that\nthis combining is responsible for paradoxical results. Therefore we speak about \"EPRBohm-Bell experiment\".\n\n3\n\n\finto it. Here \u03b8 = \u03b81 , \u03b82 and \u03b8\u2032 = \u03b81\u2032 , \u03b82\u2032 are selections of angles for orientations\nof respective PBSs.\nFollowing Bell, the selection of the angle \u03b8i determines the random variable\nA(i) (\u03c9) \u2261 a\u03b8i (\u03c9).\n\nThere are two detectors coupled to the PBS with the \u03b8-orientation: \"up-spin\"\n(or \"up-polarization\") detector and \"down-spin\" (or \"down-polarization\")\ndetector. A click of the up-detector assigns to the random variable a\u03b8 (\u03c9) the\nvalue +1 and a click of the down-detector assigns to it the value -1. However,\nsince a lot of photons disappear without any click, it is also permitted for\nrandom variables to take the value zero in the case of no detection. Therefore\nin Bell's framework it is sufficient to consider a\u03b8 (\u03c9) taking values \u22121, 0, +1.\nIn the same way selection of the angle \u03b8\u2032 determines\nB (i) (\u03c9) \u2261 b\u03b8i\u2032 (\u03c9),\nwhere b\u03b8i\u2032 (\u03c9) takes values \u22121, 0, +1.\nIt seems that Bell's random model is not proper for the EPR-Bohm-Bell\nexperiment. Bell's description does not take into account probabilities of\nchoosing pairs of angles (orientations of PBSs) \u03b811 , . . . , \u03b822 . Thus his model\nprovides only incomplete probabilistic description. This allows to include\nprobabilities of choosing experimental settings P(\u03b8ij ) into the model; this\nway completing it.\nIn the next section we shall provide such a complete probabilistic description of the EPR-Bohm-Bell experiment. We point out that random variables\nof our model (which will be put into the CHSH inequality) does not coincide\nwith Bellian variables.\n\n3\n\nProper random experiment\na). There is a source of entangled photons.\n\nb). There are four PBSs and corresponding pairs of detectors. PBSs are\nlabelled as i = 1, 2 and j = 1, 2 3 .\nc). Directly after source there is a distribution device which opens at each\ninstance of time, t = 0, \u03c4, 2\u03c4, . . . ways to only two (of four) optical\n3\n\nIt is just the form of labelling which is convenient to form pairs (i, j).\n\n4\n\n\ffibers going to the corresponding two PBSs. For simplicity, we suppose\nthat each pair (i, j) : (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 2) can be opened with equal\nprobability:\nP(i, j) = 1/4.\nWe now define \"proper random variables\". To simplify considerations, we\nconsider the ideal experiment with 100% detectors efficiency. Thus in Bell's\nframework random variables a\u03b8 (\u03c9) and b\u03b8\u2032 (\u03c9) should take only values \u00b11.\nThe zero-value will play a totally different role in our model.\n1) A(i) (\u03c9) = \u00b11, i = 1, 2 if the corresponding (up or down) detector is\ncoupled to ith PBS fires;\n2) A(i) (\u03c9) = 0 if the i-th channel is blocked. In the same way we define\nrandom variables B (j) (\u03c9) corresponding to PBSs j = 1, 2.\nOf course, the correlations of these random variables satisfy CHSH inequality.\nThus if such an experiment were performed and if CHSH inequality were\nviolated, we should seriously think about e.g. quantum non-locality or death\nof realism.\nIt would be really interesting to perform such a \"proper random experiment\" for photon polarizations.\nHowever, to see that CHSH inequality for < A(i) , B (j) >- correlations does\nnot contradict to experimental data, we could use statistical data which has\nbeen collected for experiments with fixed pairs \u03b8ij = (\u03b8i , \u03b8j\u2032 ) of orientations\nof PBS. We only need to express correlations of Bell's variables < a\u03b8i , b\u03b8j\u2032 >\nvia correlations < A(i) , B (j) >.\n\n4\n\nFrequency analysis\n\nSuppose that our version of EPR-Bohm-Bell experiment was repeated M =\n4N times and each pair (i,j) of optical fibers was opened only N times.\nThe random variables took values\n(i)\n\n(i)\n\n(j)\n\n(j)\n\nA(i) = A1 , . . . , AM , i = 1, 2, B (j) = B1 , . . . , BM , j = 1, 2.\n\n5\n\n\fThen by the law of large numbers 4 :\n(i)\n\n< A ,B\n\n(j)\n\nM\n1 X (i) (j)\n>= lim\nAk Bk .\nM \u2192\u221e M\nk=1\n\n(i)\n\n(j)\n\nWe remark that, for each pair of gates (i, j), only N pairs (Ak , Bk ) have\nboth components non zero. Thus\n(i)\n\n< A ,B\n\n(j)\n\nN\n1 X (i) (j)\n>= lim\nAkl Bkl ,\nN \u2192\u221e 4N\nl=1\n\nwhere summation is with respect to only pairs of values with both nonzero\ncomponents.\nThus the quantities < A(i) , B (j) > are not estimates for the < a\u03b8i , b\u03b8j\u2032 >\nobtained in physical experiments. The right estimates are given by\nN\n1 X (i) (j)\nA B .\nN l=1 kl kl\n\nHence the CHSH inequality for random variables A(i) , B (j) induces the following inequality for \"traditional Bellian random variables\":\n| < a\u03b81 , b\u03b81\u2032 > + < a\u03b81 , b\u03b82\u2032 > + < a\u03b82 , b\u03b81\u2032 > \u2212 < a\u03b82 , b\u03b82\u2032 > | \u2264 8.\n\n(2)\n\nIt is not violated for known experimental data for entangled photons.\nMoreover, this inequality provides a trivial constraint on correlations: each\ncorrelation of Bellian variables is majorated by 1, hence, their linear combination with \u00b1-signs is always bounded above by 4.\n\n5\n\n\"Proper probability space\"\n\nWe now construct a proper Kolmogorov probability space for the EPR-BohmBell experiment. This is a general construction for combining of probabilities produced by a few incompatible experiments. We have probabilities\n4\n\nWe assume that different trials are independent. Thus the law of large numbers is\napplicable\n\n6\n\n\fpij (\u01eb, \u01eb\u2032 ), \u01eb, \u01eb\u2032 = \u00b11, to get a\u03b8i = \u01eb, b\u03b8j\u2032 = \u01eb\u2032 in the experiment with the fixed\npair of orientations (\u03b8i , \u03b8j\u2032 ). From QM we know that\n\u03b8 \u2212 \u03b8j\u2032\n1\n1 2 \u03b8i \u2212 \u03b8j\u2032\n2 i\npij (\u01eb, \u01eb) = cos\n, pij (\u01eb, \u2212\u01eb) = sin\n.\n2\n2\n2\n2\n\n(3)\n\nHowever, this special form of probabilities is not important for us. Our\nconstruction of unifying Kolmogorov\nprobability space works well for any\nP\ncollection of probabilities pij : \u01eb,\u01eb\u2032 pij (\u01eb, \u01eb\u2032 ) = 1. We remark that pij (\u01eb, \u01eb\u2032 )\ndetermine automatically marginal probabilities:\nX\npij (\u01eb, \u01eb\u2032 ),\npi (\u01eb) =\n\u01eb\u2032\n\npj (\u01eb\u2032 ) =\n\nX\n\npij (\u01eb, \u01eb\u2032 ).\n\n\u01eb\n\nIn the EPR-Bohm-Bell experiment they are equal to 1/2.

(Jaynes critique of derivation of Bell's inequality) Jaynes [22]\ncriticized derivation of Bell's inequality which was based on Bell-ClauserHorne-Shimony (CHSH) locality condition (factorization condition). Jaynes\nemphasized that Bell did a mistake in operation with conditional probabilities, because he used the objective interpretation of probability, instead of\nthe subjective one. Opposite to Jaynes, we do not appeal to subjective probability. Moreover, our aim is not critique of some special types of derivations\nof Bell's type inequality. We point out that Bell's description of the random\nexperiment for measurement of polarization (or spin) projections for a few\nincompatible pairs of setting was incomplete. By completing this description\nwe obtain a classical probabilistic model which matches the experimental\ndata.\n\n6\n\nTwo-valued random variables\n\nWe showed in the last section how to give a complete probabilistic description\nof an EPR-Bohm-Bell experiment with random variables A(1) ,A(2) , B (1) , B (2) ,\nand \u03b7. In that description the A(i) , B (j) took three values: \u00b11 and 0. In this\nsection we show that it is also possible to do this when the A(i) , B (j) take\nonly the values \u00b11.\nBy way of illustration, let us take the standard idealized EPR-BohmBell experiment described in the beginning of the previous section with fixed\norientations \u03b81 = \u03c0/4, \u03b82 = 0, \u03b81\u2032 = \u03c0/8, \u03b82\u2032 = 3\u03c0/8. The probabilities of\nthe experimental outcome a\u03b8i = \u01eb, b\u03b8j\u2032 = \u01eb\u2032 are given by (3) and yield the\nexpected values\n1\n1\n< a\u03b81 , b\u03b81\u2032 >=< a\u03b81 , b\u03b82\u2032 >=< a\u03b82 , b\u03b81\u2032 >= \u221a , < a\u03b82 , b\u03b82\u2032 >= \u2212 \u221a\n2\n2\n\n(5)\n\nTherefore we have\n\u221a\n< a\u03b81 , b\u03b81\u2032 > + < a\u03b81 , b\u03b82\u2032 > + < a\u03b82 , b\u03b81\u2032 > \u2212 < a\u03b82 , b\u03b82\u2032 > = 2 2,\n\n(6)\n\nobtaining the Tsirelson bound [23] on the maximum quantum \"violation\" of\nthe CHSH inequality.\nWe construct a Kolmogorov probability space P = (\u03a9, F , P) with sixteen\noutcomes and five random variables: A(1) , A(2) , B (1) , B (2) , \u03b7. The first four\nrandom variables take values \u00b11 and \u03b7 takes values from 11, 12, 21, 22.\n9\n\n\fThe first eight outcomes each occur with equal probability x:\nA(1) (\u03c9) A(2) (\u03c9) B (1) (\u03c9) B (2) (\u03c9) \u03b7(\u03c9)\n1\n1\n1\n1 11\n-1\n-1\n-1\n-1 11\n1\n1\n1\n1 12\n-1\n-1\n-1\n-1 12\n1\n1\n1\n1 21\n-1\n-1\n-1\n-1 21\n1\n1\n1\n-1 22\n-1\n-1\n-1\n1 22\nThe remaining eight outcomes each occur with equal probability y:\nA(1) (\u03c9) A(2) (\u03c9) B (1) (\u03c9) B (2) (\u03c9) \u03b7(\u03c9)\n-1\n-1\n1\n1 11\n1\n1\n-1\n-1 11\n-1\n-1\n1\n1 12\n1\n1\n-1\n-1 12\n-1\n-1\n1\n1 21\n1\n1\n-1\n-1 21\n-1\n-1\n1\n-1 22\n1\n1\n-1\n1 22\nThe probabilities x and y must be non-negative and 8x + 8y = 1. One may\nverify that for i = 1, 2 and \u01eb = \u00b11:\nP(\u03c9 \u2208 \u03a9 : A(i) (\u03c9) = \u01eb) =\n\n1\n.\n2\n\nFurthermore we can check that for i, j = 1, 2 and \u01eb = \u00b11:\nP(\u03c9 \u2208 \u03a9 : A(i) (\u03c9) = \u01eb|\u03b7(\u03c9) = i1 or i2) = P(\u03c9 \u2208 \u03a9 : A(i) (\u03c9) = \u01eb|\u03b7(\u03c9) = ij) =\nand so the non-signalling condition holds. A similar set of equations hold for\nthe random variables B (j) . We see that\n< A(i) >=< B (j) >= 0,\n< A(1) , B (1) >=< A(2) , B (1) >= 8x \u2212 8y,\n10\n\n1\n2\n\n\fand\n< A(1) , B (2) >=< A(2) , B (2) >= 4x \u2212 4y.\nThe left hand side of inequality (1) becomes |16x \u2212 16y|, and so (unsurprisingly) (1) holds since 0 \u2264 x, y \u2264 1/8.\nA further calculation shows that\nE(A(i) B (j) |\u03b7 = ij) = 8x \u2212 8y,\n\nij 6= 22\n\n(7)\n\nand\nE(A(2) B (2) |\u03b7 = 22) = 8y \u2212 8x.\nIt suffices to set\n\n\u221a\n\n2+1\n\u221a ,\nx=\n16 2\n\ny=\n\n(8)\n\n\u221a\n\n2\u22121\n\u221a\n16 2\n\nin (7) and (8) to see that equation (4) is indeed satsified for the the expected\nvalues given in (5). Again we conclude that there is a probabilistic model\nconsistent with the experimental outcomes given by (5).\nEven more striking, perhaps, is the case when x = 1, y = 0. From (7)\nand (8) we have that\nE(A(1) B (1) |\u03b7 = 11) + E(A(1) B (2) |\u03b7 = 12) +\nE(A(2) B (1) |\u03b7 = 21) \u2212 E(A(2) B (2) |\u03b7 = 22) = 4\nand so the left hand side obtains its maximum mathematical value for any\ndistribution of \u00b11 \u221a\nvalued random variables. Since this is larger than Tsireleson's bound of 2 2 these outcomes are not obtainable in QM. The above\nconstruction gives a perfectly satisfactory probability space consistent with\nthese conditional expectations that satisfies the non-signalling condition.\nRemark. The probability space constructed in this section gives values to random variables corresponding to values that are not measured in\nthe EPR-Bohm-Bell experiment. For example, in the probablility space\n\u03c9 = (1, 1, 1, \u22121, 22) asserts that A(1) (\u03c9) = B (1) (\u03c9) = 1 and \u03b7(\u03c9) = 22.\nIn an EPR-Bohm-Bell experiment when the PBS's are in their second position there are no readings for a\u03b81 (\u03c9) and b\u03b81\u2032 (\u03c9), and QM gives no predictions about their value. We do not assert that \"in reality\" for this outcome\na\u03b81 (\u03c9) = b\u03b81\u2032 (\u03c9) = 1. After all, as pointed out, there may be many consistent\nways to assign values to A(1) (\u03c9) and B (1) (\u03c9). One interpretation of Bell's\n\n11\n\n\ftheorem is that there does not, however, exist any such probability space\nconsistent with (5) for which for all i=1,2 and j=1,2:\nE(A(i) B (j) |\u03b7 = ij) = E(A(i) B (j) ).\n\n(9)\n\nWe merely assert that probability spaces exist that are consistent with all\nthe available experimental data. Calculations made within the probability\nspace yielding formulae for which all the parameters can be measured may\nbe tested experimentally.\n\n7\n\nMacroscopic realization of the experiment\n\nThe experimental setting which we described in this paper, \"proper EPRBohm-Bell experiment\", can be realized in various situations outside quantum physics, e.g. in \"classical engineering.\"\nAn example for an experiment with the outcomes described above is the\nfollowing. A device is equipped with four sensors, A1 , A2 , B1 , B2 . Both\nA-sensors operate on a common power supply, as do the B-sensors. A measurement of any of the sensors needs the full capacity of its power supply.\nThus only one of the A-sensors can be active at any time and the same for the\nB-sensors. Inactive sensors return a default value 0. The device randomly\nswitches between A1 and A2 respectively B1 and B2 . When the device is\npolled exactly one A and one B sensor return a non-default readings.\nOne might examine similar experimental settings outside quantum physics.\nHowever, it seems that it would not surprise anybody from engineering. It\nis not a custom to combine the data from sensors which could not operate\nsimultaneously.\nThis paper was written during the visit of A. Khrennikov to Danish Technical University in May 2008 and finally completed during the visit of P.\nFischer to V\u00e4xj\u00f6 University.\n\nReferences\n[1] J. S.
