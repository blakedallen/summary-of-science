Our results establish a link between wave-turbulent phenomena and the appearance of quasi-topological\ndefects in inflaton dynamics.\nPACS numbers: 98.80.Cq, 11.10.Wx, 47.27.E-\n\nIn cosmological models of the universe, reheating describes\nthe epoch starting at the end of inflation [1]. During this epoch\nthe potential energy of the inflaton field is redistributed into a\nhomogeneous and isotropic hot plasma of particle excitations.\nThese become a substantial part of the further expanding universe. Simple models describing reheating after inflation invoke self-interacting scalar fields. One of the popular scenarios involves the parametrically resonant amplification of\nquantum fluctuations of the macroscopically oscillating inflaton field. The amplified modes represent the emerging matter\ncontent of the universe [2, 3]. Various theoretical approaches\nhave been proposed to model reheating. As both, the inflaton and the amplified modes are strongly populated, classical field simulations can be applied to describe their evolution\n[4\u20136]. Alternatively, Kadanoff-Baym dynamic equations, as\nderived from 2PI effective actions in nonperturbative approximation, can describe the resonant excitation and the ensuing\nthermalisation [7]. The exponentially fast excitation process is\nfollowed by a slower equilibration, possibly with transient turbulent behaviour transporting the energy deposited in the lowmomentum modes of the system to higher momenta. Classical field simulations and scaling solutions of kinetic equations\nwere used to analyse possible turbulent evolution during reheating and thermalisation [8, 9].\nRecent analytical predictions of new nonthermal fixed\npoints of the field dynamics [10] provided an extension of\nthe above turbulence scenarios into the regime beyond perturbative quantum-Boltzmann approximations [11, 12]. Being confirmed by numerical simulations [10, 13] these phenomena have triggered work in different areas [12, 14, 15],\nin particular as they have the potential to strongly alter relaxation time scales. Here we demonstrate that these nonthermal\nfixed points are characterised by metastable configurations of\nthe underlying inflaton field with a soliton-like charge distribution. We study parametric resonance in a globally O(2) or,\nequivalently, U(1) symmetric relativistic scalar field theory.\nShortly after the resonant excitations have set in we find spatial separation of charges. Both, charge and anticharge over-\n\ndensities become uniformly distributed within slowly varying regions which are separated by sharp boundary walls of\ngrossly invariant thickness. These walls have a character similar to topological defects and appear for generic initial conditions. Metastable, non-topological defects have been studied,\nmostly in the context of non-linear single-scalar field theories, with or without a broken-symmetry ground state, where\nthey are commonly termed oscillons [16]. In the present paper\nwe connect quasi-stationary soliton-like charge separation in\na two-component, O(2)-symmetric model to non-thermal stationary scaling solutions of quantum field dynamic equations\nwhich are known to exist for a far more general class of models. In this way a link is established between wave turbulence\nphenomena as discussed, e.g., in [8\u201314] and long-lived quasitopological structures in the inflaton field. The very general\nconcept of critical phenomena far from thermal equilibrium\ncan provide a new way to classify nontrivial metastable field\nconfigurations.\nThe action of the model considered here is given by\nS =\n\nZ\n\n( h\n)\ni\n\u03bb\n1\n2\n2 2\n2\n2 2\nd x dt\n(\u2202t \u03c6) \u2212 (\u2202i \u03c6) \u2212 m \u03c6 \u2212\n(\u03c6 )\n(1)\n2\n4!N\nd\n\nwhere \u03c62 \u2261 \u03c6a (x)\u03c6a (x), (\u2202i \u03c6)2 \u2261 \u2202i \u03c6a (x)\u2202i \u03c6a (x), sums over\ni = 1, . . . , d and a = 1, . . . , N, N = 2, implied. To describe the\ndynamics of the scalar field \u03c6 in the rapidly expanding universe one works in conformal coordinates in which the metric\nis defined through ds2 = a(t)2 (dt2 \u2212 dx2 ), with a scale parameter a(t) depending on the conformal time t.

For d = 3 we also observe, at late times and\nintermediate momenta, the UV weak wave turbulence exponent \u03ba ' 1.5. Note that the physical particle number spectrum is 6Nn(k, t)/\u03bb.

Fluctuating non-zero momentum modes act as seeds for the ensuing instabilities. Choosing m2 = 0 and \u03bb > 0, which corresponds to an equilibrium configuration in the symmetric phase, subsequent oscillation of the inflaton field induces parametrically resonant exponential growth of certain modes. Scattering between these\nmodes causes the entire spectrum to fill up. Our simulations of Eq. (3) were performed on a cubic space-time lattice\nof Ld gridpoints using leap-frog discretisation and periodical\nboundary conditions in d = 2 and 3 spatial dimensions. The\ntime evolution of the system after the instabilities have set in\nwas found to be best described by a turbulent stage followed\nby thermalisation on the largest time scales. The turbulent\nphases feature universal scaling of the (solid-)angle-averaged\nmomentum-space occupation numbers\nZ\np\n1\ndd\u22121 \u03a9k h|\u2202t \u03a6(k, t)|2 ih|\u03a6(k, t)|2 i.\n(5)\nn(k, t) = d\n4L\nFrom standard analytical studies based on quantum Boltzmann equations [17], one expects to find, during these phases,\nthe above radial occupation number to scale as n(k, t) \u223c k\u2212\u03ba\nwhere the specific power-law exponent \u03ba reflects weak wave\nturbulence. The distribution is approximately time independent, n(k, t) \u2261 n(k), for k within the so-called inertial range,\n\nbut in contrast to thermal equilibrium, energy is flowing\nthrough this range, between sources and sinks, establishing\na non-equilibrium stationary state. Different exponents \u03ba are\npossible, depending on whether the radial flow of energy is independent of k, P(k) \u2261 P, or the radial flow of (quasi-)particle\nnumber, Q(k) \u2261 Q [17]. In summary, one finds the possible\nexponents [10, 12, 17]\n3\n\u03baP = d + (z \u2212 2),\n2\n\n\u03baQ = d + z \u2212 3.\n\n(6)\n\nwhere z is the homogeneity index of the dispersion \u03c9(sk) =\nsz \u03c9(k) of mode k. Note that in thermal equilibrium one expects \u03bath = z, corresponding to the Rayleigh-Jeans law. Given\npositive \u03ba, occupation numbers grow large in the infrared (IR)\nand the Boltzmann perturbative approximation breaks down.\nIn [10, 12], an expansion of the two-particle irreducible (2PI)\neffective action to next-to-leading order in the inverse 1/N\nof the number of field components was used to extend the\nwave-turbulence analysis into the IR regime. In this scheme,\nbubble-chain diagrams contributing to the self-energy in the\ndynamic Dyson equation are resummed, resulting in an effectively renormalised many-body coupling. With this, scaling\nexponents can also be derived in the IR regime:\n\u03baIR\nP = d + 2z,\n\n\u03baIR\nQ =d+z\n\n(7)\n\nAs was first brought forward in [10] for the case of an O(4)\nmodel, numerical simulations of parametric resonance confirm both, the IR and the UV scaling exponents. Corresponding results for the model studied here are shown in Fig. 1 for\nd = 2 and d = 3 at different instances of time t.\nAs was shown in [17], for our model (1), in wave turbulence, either energy flows with rate P towards larger k or\nquasiparticles flow with rate Q towards lower k. In our simulations, the resonantly induced momentum distribution is observed to act, during the further evolution, as a source at intermediate momenta, k ' 0.1..0.3, see Fig. 1. Our model implies\n\n\f3\n\nFigure 2: Modulus |\u03a6(x, t)| = [\u03a621 (x, t) + \u03a622 (x, t)]1/2 at lattice time\nt = 9 \u00d7 103 . Shown is its distribution over the two-dimensional 9602\nlattice used in our simulations. \"Defect\" lines with substantially reduced \u03c1 = j0 (cf.

We note that in contrast to cases with\nsmaller 1/N discussed in [10, 13] we find, in the IR, \u03ba ' 3.5\n(d = 2) and 4.5 (d = 3). In the UV, assuming a constant flow\nP from intermediate to larger momenta one expects, from (6),\n\u03baUV\nP = d \u2212 3/2. Numerically we find that in the UV the occupation number distribution approaches, at large times, thermal\nscaling \u03bath = 1. For d = 3 we also observe, at late times and\nintermediate momenta, the expected UV weak wave turbulence exponent \u03ba ' 1.5.\nHaving recovered scaling behaviour we present, in the following, our central result: Looking at the real-space structure of the emerging critical configuration we find patterns\nsimilar to topological defects giving rise to quasi-stationary\ncharge separation. We find a correspondence between the appearance of the strong scaling exponent and of the defectseparated charge patterns. In Fig. 2 we depict, for d = 2, a\ntypical real-space configuration in the turbulent stage, plotting the modulus of the O(2) scalar field, |\u03a6(x, t)| = [\u03a621 (x, t) +\n\u03a622 (x, t)]1/2 . Localised regions appear, specifically \"defect\"\nlines where the absolute value of the field is much smaller\nthan its average. Fig. 3 shows the corresponding charge density \u03c1(x, t) = j0 (x, t), Eq. (4). Clearly, both uniform charge\nand anti-charge overdensities appear within distinctly separated regions, showing only small fluctuations as compared to\ntheir bulk values. This separation of charges is confirmed by\nthe histogram of local charge densities shown in Fig. 4. We\nfound similar histograms for the case of the O(N) model (1)\nwith N = 3, 4 which we will study in more elsewhere.\nMoreover, we see that the \"defect\" lines in Fig. 2 are lying along the boundary limits between the regions of opposite\ncharge. Note that only part of the boundaries is clearly visible\nas \"defect\" lines. Following the time evolution of the defect\nlines [18] we find that they appear and disappear with a period of T/2 ' 6 determined by the effective mass meff = 2\u03c0/T\nof the mean field theory, at every point along the boundaries\nbetween the oppositely charged domains. The explanation for\n\nFigure 3: Charge density \u03c1(x, t) = j0 (x, t) (cf. (4)), for the same\nconfiguration as shown in Fig. 2. Note the evenly distributed charge\noverdensities with opposite sign, separated by lines which include\nthe \"defect\" lines shown in Fig. 2.\n\nFigure 4: Histogram of the charge density distribution of the system\nin d = 2, at points of time for which Fig. 1 shows the corresponding\nspectra. We find that a clear charge separation goes together with the\nstrong IR scaling with \u03ba = 3.5.\n\nthe appearance of these lines is as follows: The charge density \u03c1 can be interpreted as field angular momentum in the\nN = 2 dimensional field space. Hence, d-dimensional configuration space can be divided into regions according to the\nsign of \u03c1. On the lines separating these regions the local field\nvariable has neighbours of opposite charge which therefore\npossess opposite \"circular polarisation\" in field space. Thus,\nat a particular point on the boundary the rotations add to a\nlinear oscillation of the field through zero, giving rise to spatially and temporally oscillating defect lines. While such an\nevolution could similarly occur in a free theory (\u03bb = 0) interactions are responsible for rendering the transition between\nthe opposite charges sharp as can be seen in Fig. 2.\nFollowing the evolution of the system starting from the homogeneous initial configuration we find the defect lines to\nappear once the instability has saturated. The lines can reconnect with each other while they propagate slowly through\nconfiguration space, such that the number of spatially connected charged regions changes in time. On the average, the\ntotal length of the defect lines as well as the number of con-\n\n\f4\n\nFigure 5: Charge density \u03c1(x, t) = j0 (x, t) (cf.

The scale of the\nlargest structures is found not to depend on the total lattice size.\n\nnected regions is found to decrease with time, see Fig. 5. During the late stage of the evolution the separation of opposite\ncharges gradually disappears while the system finally thermalises. This can also be seen in the histogram in Fig. 4\nwhere the central well gradually disappears while the spectrum n(k, t) approaches thermal equilibrium, see Fig. 1. We\nnote that the sharp step between the opposite charges remains\n(Fig. 5, bottom right panel). This, as well as the histogram\nin Fig. 4 suggest that topological defects occur according to\nthe homotopy group of the charge density space C instead of\nthe order parameter space. Although C, for the O(2) model,\nequals the real numbers, our results show, that the system remains, for a long time, in a subspace which is topologically\nequivalent to S 0 = {\u22121, 1} \u2208 C. Hence, one expects defect\nlines (walls) to separate regions corresponding to the two unconnected parts of C.\nFor d = 3, starting from an equivalent initial configuration,\nwe find bubbles of opposite charge separated by thin walls\n(Fig. 6) [18] as well as charge density histograms similar to the\ncase d = 2. These bubbles are seen to appear in coincidence\nwith the strong IR scaling in the spectra (Fig. 1, right panel).\nWe emphasise that the structures found are distinctly different from the known topological defects appearing in O(2)\ntheories such as vortices in d = 2 and vortex strings in d = 3\nwhich one obtains in the case of equilibrium symmetry breaking, i.e., m2 < 0 [6]. The bubble walls reported here form for\nvanishing or positive mass squared.\nConsidering other potential cosmological consequences of\nour findings, notice that, in a different context, the U(1)symmetric scalar field theory can also be understood as an ingredient of Affleck-Dine baryogenesis [19], where the scalar\nfield carries a baryon charge and is thought to be a supersymmetric partner of standard-model fields. We emphasize that,\nin contrast to such models, there is no symmetry breaking implemented in our model from the outset. The breaking rather\noccurs as a dynamical, transient but quasistationary effect.\nTo summarize, we have studied parametric reheating in an\n\nFigure 6: Bubbles of approximately constant and opposite charge\nseparated by thin walls on a 643 lattice at t = 1500. Plotted are\nsurface lines which are fitted to lattice points having |\u03a6|2 < 0.05.\n\nO(2) symmetric scalar field theory in two and three spatial dimensions. We have found structures similar to (quasi-) topological defects to emerge on intermediate time scales, breaking charge symmetry locally while the classical action implies an equilibrium configuration without symmetry breaking. These structures were found to appear in direct correspondence with strong wave-turbulent scaling behaviour of\noccupation numbers in the IR regime of low momenta. This\nestablishes a strong link between wave-turbulence and quasistationary defect-like pattern formation of inflaton dynamics\nin scenarios of reheating. It is an interesting question whether\nsimilar structures exist in more complicated theories, such as\ngauge theories.\nThe authors would like to thank J. Berges, J. M. Pawlowski,\nand M. G.
