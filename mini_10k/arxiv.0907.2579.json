Then, the\nconventional systematic way of dealing with the long-distance part is to parameterize it in terms of matrix\nelements of quark and gluon operators between hadronic states (or the vacuum). These matrix elements stem\nfrom nonperturbative phenomena and have to be either extracted from experiment or be determined on the\nlattice. In many phenomenological applications they are usually modeled in terms of various nonperturbative\nmethods or models.\nGenerically, the application of QCD to hadronic processes involves the consideration of hard parton subprocesses and (unknown) nonperturbative functions to describe binding effects. Prominent examples are hard\nexclusive hadronic processes which involve hadron distribution amplitudes (DAs), generalized distribution amplitudes (GDAs), and generalized parton distributions (GPDs) [5, 6, 7, 8]. Applying such a framework, collisions\nof a real and a highly-virtual photon provide a useful tool for studying a variety of fundamental aspects of QCD.\nRecently, nonperturbative quantities of a new kind were introduced-transition distribution amplitudes\n(TDAs) [9, 10, 11]-which are closely related to the GPDs. In contrast to the GDAs, the TDAs appear in\nthe factorization procedure when the Mandelstam variable s is of the same order of magnitude as the large\nphoton virtuality Q2 , while t is rather small. Remarkably, there exists a reaction where both amplitude types,\nGDAs and TDAs, can overlap. This can happen in the fusion of a real and transversely polarized photon with a\nhighly-virtual longitudinally polarized photon, giving rise to a final state which comprises a pair of pions. The\nkey feature of this reaction is that it can potentially follow either path: proceed via twist-3 GDAs, or go through\nthe leading-twist TDAs, as illustrated in Fig. 1. Such an antagonism of alternative factorization mechanisms in\nthis reaction seems extremely interesting both theoretically and phenomenologically and deserves to be studied\nin detail.\nThe intimate relation between these two mechanisms in the production of a vector-meson pair was analyzed\nin [12] and it was found that these mechanisms can be selected by means of the different polarizations of the\ninitial-state photon. In contrast, for (pseudo)scalar particles, such as the pions, this effect is absent enabling us\nto access the overlap region of both mechanisms and their duality as opposed to their additivity.\nIn this talk, we will report on the possibility for duality between these antagonistic mechanisms of factorization, associated either with GDAs or with TDAs, in the regime where both Mandelstam variables s and t are\nrather small compared to the large photon virtuality Q2 .\n\n\f2\n\u03b3\u2217\n\n\u03b3\u2217\n\u03c01\n\nLO GDA fact.\n\n\u03c02\n\n\u03b3\u2217\n\n\u03c02\n\n\u03b3\n\n\u03b3\n\n\u03c01\n\nLO TDA fact.\n\n\u03c01\n\n\u03b3\n\u03c02\n\nFigure 1: Two ways of factorization: via the GDA mechanism and via the TDA mechanism.\n\nREGIMES OF FACTORIZATION WITHIN THE \u03c63E -MODEL\n\nII.\n\nConsider first the factorization of the scalar \u03c63E model in Euclidean space. To study the four-particle amplitude\nin detail, it is particularly useful to employ the \u03b1-representation-see [7]. Then, the contribution of the leading\n\"box\" diagram can be written as (while details can be found in [13])\n4\n\ng\nA(s, t, m ) = \u2212\n16\u03c0 2\n2\n\nZ\u221e\n0\n\n4\nQ\n\nd\u03b1i\n\ni=1\n\nD2\n\n\u0015\n\u0014\n\u0001\n1\n2\n2 2\nexp \u2212\nQ \u03b11 \u03b12 + s\u03b12 \u03b14 + t\u03b11 \u03b13 + m D ,\nD\n\n(1)\n\nwhere m2 serves as a infrared (IR) regulator, s > 0, t > 0 are the Mandelstam variables in the Euclidean\n4\nP\n\u03b1i . Assuming that q 2 = Q2 is large compared to the mass scale m2 (which simulates here\nregion, and D =\ni=1\n\nthe typical scale of soft interactions), the amplitude (1) can indeed be factorized. As regards the other two\nkinematic variables s and t, one can identify three distinct regimes of factorization: (a) s \u226a Q2 while t is of\norder Q2 ; (b) t \u226a Q2 while s is of order Q2 ; (c) s, t \u226a Q2 .\nRegime (a): The process is going through the s-channel. In this regime, the main contribution in the integral\nin Eq. (1) arises from the integration over \u03b11 when \u03b11 \u223c 0:\n2\nAas\nGDA (s, t, m )\n\ng4\n=\u2212\n16\u03c0 2\n\nZ\u221e\n0\n\n\u0013\u0014\n\u0015\u22121\n\u0012\n\u03b12 \u03b14\n\u03b13\nd\u03b12 d\u03b13 d\u03b14\n2 \u03b12\n2\n2\n.\nexp \u2212s\n\u2212 m D0 Q\n+t\n+m\nD02\nD0\nD0\nD0\n\n(2)\n\nSchematically this means that the propagator, parameterized by \u03b11 , can be associated with the partonic (hard)\nsubprocesses, while the remaining propagator constitutes the soft part of the considered amplitude, i.e., the\nscalar version of the GDA.\nRegime (b): Here we have to eliminate from the exponential in Eq. (1) the variables Q2 and s, which are\nlarge. This can be achieved by integrating over the region \u03b12 \u223c 0. Performing similar manipulations as in\n2\nregime (a), we find that the scalar TDA amplitude can be related to the scalar GDA via Aas\nTDA (s, t, m ) =\n2\nAas\n(t,\ns,\nm\n).\nGDA\nRegime (c): The relevant regime to investigate duality is when it happens that both variables s and t are\nsimultaneously small compared to Q2 , i.e., when s, t \u226a Q2 . In this case, there are two possibilities to extract\nthe leading Q2 -asymptotics, notably, we can either integrate over the region \u03b11 \u223c 0, or integrate instead over\nthe region \u03b12 \u223c 0. Clearly, these two options can be associated with (i) the GDA mechanism of factorization\nwith the meson pair scattered at a small angle in its center-of-mass system or, alternatively, (ii) with the\nTDA mechanism of factorization. We stress that we may face double counting when naively adding these\ntwo contributions. We interpret such a behavior as a signal of an ingrained tendency for duality between the\nGDA(s-channel) and the TDA (t-channel) factorization mechanisms.\nIn order to verify the appearance of duality we carry out a numerical investigation of the exact and the\nas\nasymptotic amplitudes. In doing so, we introduce the following ratios R1 = Aas\nTDA /A and R2 = AGDA /A.\n2\nAppealing to the symmetry of these ratios under the exchange of the variables s \u2194 t, we take t/Q to be 0.01\nand look for the variation of the ratios with s/Q2 . This variation is illustrated in Fig. 2 from which one sees that\nin the region where s/Q2 is rather small, i.e., in the range (0.01, 0.05), both asymptotic formulae are describing\nthe exact amplitude with an accuracy of more than 90%. This behavior supports the conclusion that, when\n\n\f3\n\n2\n\n2\n\nRatio R\n\n2\n\nm /Q =0.001 and t/Q =0.01\n\nRatio R\n\n1\n\n2\n\nRatio of Amplitudes\n\n1,20\n\n1,15\n\n1,10\n\n1,05\n\n1,00\n0,0\n\n0,1\n\n0,2\n\n0,3\n\n0,4\n\n0,5\n\n0,6\n\n0,7\n\n0,8\n\n2\n\ns/Q\n\nFigure 2: The ratios R1 and R2 as functions of s/Q2 .\n\nboth Mandelstam variables s/Q2 and t/Q2 assume values in the wide interval (0.001, 0.7), duality between the\nTDA and the GDA factorization mechanisms emerges.\nIII.\n\nTDA- AND GDA-FACTORIZATIONS FOR \u03b3\u03b3 \u2217 \u2192 \u03c0\u03c0\n\nHaving discussed the appearance of duality between the GDA and the TDA factorization schemes within a toy\nmodel, we now turn attention to real QCD. To analyze duality, we consider the exclusive \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 production in a\n\u03b3T \u03b3L\u2217 collision, where the virtual photon with a large virtuality Q2 is longitudinally polarized, whereas the other\none is quasi real and transversely polarized. Notice that the GDA and the TDA regimes correspond to the same\nhelicity amplitudes. Given that the considered process involves a longitudinally and a transversally polarized\nphoton, we are actually dealing with twist-3 GDAs [14]. On the other hand, for the twist-2 contribution, related\nto the meson DA, we use the standard parametrization of the \u03c0 + -to-vacuum matrix element which involves a\nbilocal axial-vector quark operator [1]. Finally, the \u03b3 \u2192 \u03c0 \u2212 axial-vector matrix elements can be parameterized\nin the form, cf. [10],\nF\n\nh\u03c0 \u2212 (p2 )|\u03c8\u0304(\u2212z/2)\u03b3\u03b1 \u03b35 [\u2212z/2; z/2]\u03c8(z/2)|\u03b3(q \u2032, \u03b5\u2032 )i =\n\ne \u2032\n\u03b5 * \u2206T P\u03b1 A1 (x, \u03be, t) ,\nf\u03c0 T\n\n(3)\n\nF\n\nwhere P = (p2 + q \u2032 )/2, and \u2206 = p2 \u2212 q \u2032 , and noticing that the symbol = means Fourier transformation and that\nthe vector matrix element does not contribute here. To normalize the axial-vector TDA, A1 , we express it in\nterms of the axial-vector form factor measured in the weak decay \u03c0 \u2192 l\u03bdl \u03b3 [13, 15, 16]. The helicity amplitude\nassociated with the TDA mechanism reads\nTDA\nATDA\n(0,j) = F\n\n\u03b5\u2032 (j) * \u2206T\nQ\n\n(4)\n\nwith\nF TDA = [4 \u03c0 \u03b1s (Q2 )]\n\n\u0012\n\u0013\u0012\n\u0013\nCF\ntw\u22122 DA tw\u22122 TDA ,\n2 Nc\n\nwhere\n\u0012\n\u0012\n\u0013 Z1\n\u0013\n1 1\ntw\u22122 DA = dy \u03c6\u03c0 (y)\n,\n+\ny \u0233\n0\n\n(5)\n\n\f4\n\u0012\n\u0013 Z1\n\u0012\n\u0013\neu\ned\ntw\u22122 TDA = dx A1 (x, \u03be, t)\n,\n\u2212\n\u03be\u2212x \u03be+x\n\n(6)\n\n\u22121\n\n2\n\nemploying the 1-loop \u03b1s (Q ) in the MS-scheme with \u039bQCD = 0.312 GeV for Nf = 3 [17]. [Note that there is\nonly a mild dependence on \u039bQCD .]\nTurning now to the helicity amplitude, which includes the twist-3 GDA, we anticipate that it can be written\nas (see, for example, [14])\nGDA\nAGDA\n(0,j) = F\n\n\u03b5 \u2032 (j) * \u2206T\nQ\n\n(7)\n\nwith\nF GDA = 2\n\n\u0012\n\u0013\nW 2 + Q2 2\n2\n(e\n+\ne\n)\ntw\n\u2212\n3\nGDA\nWW\n,\nu\nd\nQ2\n\n(8)\n\nwhere\n\u0012\n\u0013 Z1\n\u0013\n\u0012\nln \u0233 ln y\n2\ntw \u2212 3 GDA WW = dy \u2202\u03b6 \u03a61 (y, \u03b6, W )\n,\n\u2212\ny\n\u0233\n\n(9)\n\n0\n\nwith the partial derivative being defined by \u2202\u03b6 = \u2202/\u2202(2\u03b6 \u2212 1). In deriving (8), we have used for the twist-3\ncontribution the Wandzura-Wilczek approximation. Duality between expressions (5) and (8) may occur in\nthat regime, where both variables s and t are simultaneously much smaller in comparison to the large photon\nvirtuality Q2 . More insight into the relative weight of the amplitudes with TDA or GDA contributions can be\ngained once we have modeled these non-perturbative quantities. We commence our analysis with the TDAs\nf\u03c0\nFA (t)A1 (x, \u03be),\nand, assuming a factorizing ansatz for the t-dependence of the TDAs, we write A1 (x, \u03be, t) = 2 m\n\u03c0\nwhere the t-independent function A1 (x, \u03be) is normalized to unity. To satisfy the unity-normalization condition,\nwe introduce a TDA defined by\nA1 (x, 1) =\n\nA1non\u2212norm (x, 1)\nR1\n\n(10)\n\ndxA1non\u2212norm (x, 1)\n\n\u22121\n\nand continue with the discussion of the t-independent TDAs. Recalling that we are mainly interested in TDAs\nin the region \u03be = 1 [1, 2], it is useful to adopt the following parametrization\n\u0012\n\u0013\n(3/2)\n(3/2)\n(3/2)\nA1non\u2212norm (x, 1) = (1 \u2212 x2 ) 1 + a1 C1\n(x) + a2 C2\n(x) + a4 C4\n(x) ,\n(11)\nwhere a1 , a2 , a4 are free adjustable parameters, encoding nonperturbative input, and the standard notations for\nGegenbauer polynomials are used. It is not difficult to show that the TDA expressed by Eq. (11) results from\nsumming a D-term, i.e., the term with the coefficient a1 , and meson-DA-like contributions. For our analysis,\nwe suppose that a1 \u2261 d0 [8], which is equal to \u22120.5 in lattice simulations. With respect to the parameters a2\nand a4 , we allow them to vary in quite broad intervals, notably, a2 \u2208 [0.3, 0.6] and a4 \u2208 [0.4, 0.8], that would\ncover vector-meson DAs with very different profiles at a normalization scale \u03bc2 \u223c 1 GeV 2 (see, for example,\n[18]). The function \u03a61 (z, \u03b6) is rather standard and well-known (details in [5, 13]).\nWe close this section by summarizing our numerical analysis presented in [13]. We calculated both functions\nF TDA and F GDA , and show the results in Fig. 3. The dashed line corresponds to the function F TDA , where we\nhave adjusted the free parameters to a2 = 0.6, a4 = 0.8. The results, obtained for rather small values of these\nparameters, are displayed by the broken lines in the same figure. The dotted line denotes the function F TDA\nwith a2 = 0.5 and a4 = 0.6, whereas the dashed-dotted line employs a2 = 0.3 and a4 = 0.4. For comparison, we\nalso include the results for F GDA . In that latter case, the dense-dotted line corresponds to the GDA amplitude,\nwhere the expression for B\u030312 has been estimated via Eq. (20) of [13], while the solid line represents the simplest\nansatz for B\u030312 with R\u03c0 = 0.5. From this figure one may infer that when the parameter B\u030312 , which parameterizes\nthe GDA contribution, is estimated with the aid of the Breit-Wigner formula (provided s, t \u226a Q2 ), there is\nduality between the GDA and the TDA factorization mechanisms. Hence, the model for \u03a61 (z, \u03b6), which takes\ninto account the corresponding resonances, can be selected by duality.\n\n\f5\n\na =-0.5\n\nGDA, R =0.5;\n\n1\n\nTDA, a =0.6, a =0.8\n2\n\nTDA, a =0.5, a =0.6;\n2\n\nGDA with B\n\n1,4\n\n12\n\n4\n\nTDA, a =0.3, a =0.4\n\n4\n\n2\n\n4\n\n(s) as in (19) in [13]\n\nF - amplitude\n\n1,2\n\n1,0\n\n0,8\n\n0,6\n\n0,4\n\n0,2\n\n0,0\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\n\n14\n\n16\n\n2\n\nQ\n\nFigure 3: Helicity amplitudes F TDA and F GDA as functions of Q2 , using a1 = \u22120.5 found in lattice simulations. The\nvalue of s/Q2 varies in the interval [0.06, 0.3].\n\nIV.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nWe have provided evidence that when both Mandelstam variables s and t turn out to be much less than\nthe large momentum scale Q2 , with the variables s/Q2 and t/Q2 varying in the interval [0.001, 0.7], the TDA\nand the GDA factorization mechanisms are equivalent to each other and operate in parallel. We have also\ndemonstrated that duality may serve as a tool for selecting suitable models for the nonperturbative ingredients\nof various exclusive amplitudes entering QCD factorization. In this context, we observed that twist-3 GDAs\nappear to be dual to the convolutions of leading-twist TDAs and DAs, multiplied by a QCD effective coupling.\nV.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nWe would like to thank A.
