SMITH\nA BSTRACT. We prove that every projective embedding of a connected scheme determined\nby the complete linear series of a sufficiently ample line bundle is defined by the 2 \u00d7 2 minors\nof a 1-generic matrix of linear forms. Extending the work of Eisenbud-Koh-Stillman for\nintegral curves, we also provide effective descriptions for such determinantally presented\nample line bundles on products of projective spaces, Gorenstein toric varieties, and smooth\nvarieties.\n\n1. I NTRODUCTION\nRelating the geometric properties of a variety to the structural features of its defining equations is a fundamental challenge in algebraic geometry. Describing generators for the homogeneous ideal associated to a projective scheme is a basic form of this problem. For a rational\nnormal curve, a Segre variety, or a quadratic Veronese variety, the homogeneous ideal is conveniently expressed as the 2-minors (i.e. the determinants of all 2 \u00d7 2 submatrices) of a\ngeneric Hankel matrix, a generic matrix, or a generic symmetric matrix respectively. These\ndeterminantal representations lead to a description of the minimal graded free resolution of\nthe homogeneous ideal of the variety and equations for higher secant varieties. Mumford's\n\"somewhat startling observation\" in [M, p. 31] is that a suitable multiple of every projective\nembedding is the intersection of a quadratic Veronese variety with a linear space and, hence,\ndefined by the 2-minors of a matrix of linear forms. Exercise 6.10 in [Ei2] rephrases this as\na \"(vague) principle that embeddings of varieties by sufficiently positive bundles are often\ndefined by ideals of 2\u00d72 minors\". Our primary goal is to provide a precise form of this\nprinciple.\nTo be more explicit, consider a scheme X embedded in Pr by the complete linear series of\na line bundle L. As in [EKS, p. 514], the line bundle L is called determinantally presented\nif the homogeneous ideal IX|Pr of X in Pr is generated by the 2-minors of a 1-generic matrix\n(i.e. no conjugate matrix has a zero entry) of linear forms. Definition 3.1 in [Gr2] states that\na property holds for a sufficiently ample line bundle on X if there exists a line bundle A such\nthat the property holds for all L \u2208 Pic(X ) for which L \u2297 A\u22121 is ample. Our main result is:\nTheorem 1.1. Every sufficiently ample line bundle on a connected scheme is determinantally\npresented.\nWe also describe, in terms of Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity, a collection of determinantally presented line bundles on an arbitrary projective scheme; see Corollary 3.3.\n2010 Mathematics Subject Classification. 14A25, 14F05, 13D02.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nJ. SIDMAN AND G.G. SMITH\n\nThis theorem is a new incarnation of a well-known phenomenon - roughly speaking, the\ncomplexity of the first few syzygies of a projective subscheme is inversely related to the\npositivity of the corresponding linear series. Nevertheless, Theorem 1.1 counter-intuitively\nimplies that most projective embeddings by a complete linear series are simply the intersection of a Segre variety with a linear subspace. More precisely, if we fix the Euclidean metric\non the ample cone Amp(X ) which it inherits from the finite-dimensional real vector space\nN 1 (X ) \u2297 R, then the fraction of determinantally presented ample classes within distance \u03c1\nof the trivial class approaches 1 has \u03c1 tends to \u221e.\nTheorem 1.1 also has consequences beyond showing that the homogeneous ideal is generated by quadrics of rank at least 2. Proposition 6.13 in [Ei2] shows that an Eagon-Northcott\ncomplex is a direct summand of the minimal graded free resolution of the ideal. Despite the\nclassic examples, being able to give a complete description of this resolution in the general\nsetting seems overly optimistic. However, a determinantal presentation provides many equations for higher secant varieties; see Proposition 1.3 in [EKS]. For a scheme X \u2282 Pr , let\nSeck (X ) be the Zariski closure of the union of the linear spaces spanned by collections of\nk + 1 points on X . A natural generalization of Theorem 1.1 would be:\nConjecture 1.2. Let k be a positive integer. If X \u2282 Pr is embedded by the complete linear\nseries of a sufficiently ample line bundle, then the homogeneous ideal of Seck (X ) is generated\nby the (k + 2)-minors of a 1-generic matrix of linear forms.\nThis conjecture holds for rational normal curves (see Proposition 4.3 in [Ei1]), rational normal scrolls (see Proposition 2.2 in [C-J]), Segre varieties, and quadratic Veronese varieties\n(see [SS, \u00a74]). It also extends the conjecture for curves appearing in [EKS, p. 518] for\nwhich [Rav] proves a set-theoretic version and [Gin, \u00a77] proves a scheme-theoretic version.\nAlthough Theorem 1.1.4 in [BGL] produces counterexamples to this conjecture for some\nsingular X , Corollary 1.2.4 in [BGL] provides supporting evidence when X is smooth. Theorem 1.3 in [BB] suggests that the secant varieties in Conjecture 1.2 should be replaced by\ncactus varieties.\nThe secondary goal of this article is to effectively bound the determinantally presented\nline bundles on specific schemes. For an integral curve of genus g, Theorem 1 in [EKS]\nshows that a line bundle is determinantally presented when its degree is at least 4g + 2 and\nthis bound is sharp. We provide the analogous result on smooth varieties and Gorenstein\ntoric varieties:\nTheorem 1.3. Let X be a smooth variety of dimension n or an n-dimensional Gorenstein\n\u0001\ntoric variety and let A be a very ample line bundle on X such that (X , A) 6= Pn , OPn (1) . If B\nis a nef line bundle, KX is the dualizing bundle on X , and L := KX2 \u2297 A j \u2297 B with j > 2n + 2,\nthen L is determinantally presented.\nAs an application of our methods, we describe determinantally presented ample line bundles\non products of projective spaces; see Theorem 4.1.\nTo prove these theorems, we need a source of appropriate matrices. Composition of linear\nseries (a.k.a. multiplication in total coordinate ring or the Cox ring) traditionally supply the\nrequired matrices. If X \u2282 Pr is embedded by the complete linear series for a line bundle\n\n\fLINEAR DETERMINANTAL EQUATIONS\n\n3\n\nL, then H 0 (X , L) is the space of linear forms on Pr . Factoring L as L = E \u2297 E \u2032 for some\nE, E \u2032 \u2208 Pic(X ) yields a natural map \u03bc : H 0 (X , E) \u2297 H 0(X , E \u2032) \u2732 H 0 (X , E \u2297 E \u2032 ) = H 0 (X , L).\nBy choosing ordered bases y1 , . . . , ys \u2208 H 0 (X , E) and z1 , . . . , zt \u2208 H 0 (X , E \u2032 ), we obtain an\nassociated (s \u00d7 t)-matrix \u03a9 := [\u03bc (yi \u2297 z j )] of linear forms. The matrix \u03a9 is 1-generic and\nits ideal I2 (\u03a9) of 2-minors vanishes on X ; see Proposition 6.10 in [Ei2]. Numerous classic\nexamples of this construction can be found in [Roo].\nWith these preliminaries, the problem reduces to finding conditions on E and E \u2032 which\nguarantee that IX|Pr = I2 (\u03a9). Inspired by the approach in [EKS], Theorem 3.2 achieves this\nby placing restrictions on certain modules arising from the line bundles L, E, and E \u2032 . The key\nhypotheses require these modules to have a linear free presentation; the generators of the\nN-graded modules have degree 0 and their first syzygies must have degree 1. Methods introduced by Green and Lazarsfeld [Gr1, GL1] (for an expository account see [Ei2, \u00a78], [Gr3], or\n[La1, \u00a71]) yield a cohomological criterion for our modules to have a linear free presentation.\nHence, we can prove Theorem 1.1 by combining this with uniform vanishing results derived\nfrom Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity. Building on known conditions (i.e. sufficient conditions for a line bundle to satisfy N1 ), we obtain effective criteria for the appropriate modules\nto have a linear free presentation on Gorenstein toric varieties, and smooth varieties.\nRather than focusing exclusively on a single factorization of the line bundle L, we set up\nthe apparatus to handle multiple factorizations; see Lemma 3.1. Multiple factorizations of a\nline bundle were used in [BH] to study the equations and syzygies of elliptic normal curves\nand their secant varieties. They also provide a geometric interpretation for the flattenings\nappearing in [GSS, \u00a77] and [CGG, p. 1915]. Using this more general setup, we are able to\ndescribe the homogeneous ideal for every embedding of a product of projective spaces by a\nvery ample line bundle as the 2-minors of appropriate 1-generic matrices of linear forms; see\nProposition 4.4.\nC ONVENTIONS . In this paper, N is the set of nonnegative integers, 1W \u2208 Hom(W,W ) is the\nidentity map, and 1 := (1, . . . , 1) is the vector in which every entry is 1. We work over an\nalgebraically closed field k of characteristic zero. A variety is always irreducible and all\nof our toric varieties are normal. For a vector bundle U , we write U j for the j-fold tensor\nproduct U \u2297 j = U \u2297 * * * \u2297U .\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS .

L INEAR F REE P RESENTATIONS\nThis section collects the criteria needed to show that certain modules arising from line bundles have a linear free presentation. While accomplishing this, we also establish some notation and nomenclature used throughout the document.\n\n\f4\n\nJ. SIDMAN AND G.G. SMITH\n\nLet X be a projective scheme over k, let F be a coherent OX -module, and let L be a\nline bundle on X . \u0001We write \u0393(L) := H 0 (X , L) for the k-vector space of \u0001global sections\nand S := Sym \u0393(L) for the homogeneous coordinate ring of Pr := P \u0393(L) . Consider the\nL\nN-graded S-module F := j>0 H 0 (X , F \u2297 L j ). When F = OX , F is the section ring of L.\nHowever, when F = L, the module F is the truncation of the section ring omitting the zeroth\ngraded piece and shifting degrees by \u22121. Let P\u2022 be a minimal graded free resolution of F:\n***\n\n\u2732\n\nM\n\nS(\u2212ai, j )\nw\n\n\u2732\n\n***\n\n\u2732\n\nPi\n\nM\n\nS(\u2212a1, j )\nw\n\n\u2732\n\nM\n\nP1\n\nS(\u2212a0, j )\nw\n\n\u2732\n\nF\n\n\u2732\n\n0.\n\nP0\n\nFollowing [EKS, p. 515], we say that, for p \u2208 N, F has a linear free resolution to stage\nL\np with respect to L or F has a linear free resolution to stage p if Pi = S(\u2212i) for all\n0 6 i 6 p. Thus, F has a linear free resolution to stage 0 if and only if it is generated in\ndegree 0. Since having a linear free resolution to stage 1 implies that the relations among\nthe generators (a.k.a. first syzygies) are linear, the module F has a linear free resolution to\nstage 1 if and only if it has a linear free presentation. In this case, we say that F has a\nlinear free presentation with respect to L. More generally, having a linear free resolution to\nstage p is the module-theoretic analogue of the N p -property introduced in [GL1, \u00a73]. If X is\nconnected, then the line bundle L satisfies N1 precisely when L has a linear free presentation\nwith respect to itself and satisfies N p when L has a linear free resolution to stage p. Following\nConvention 0.4 in [EL], we do not assume that X is normal.\nHenceforth, we assume that L is globally generated. In other words, the natural evaluation\nmap evL : \u0393(L) \u2297k OX \u2732 L is surjective. If ML := Ker(evL ), then ML is a vector bundle of\nrank r := dimk \u0393(L) \u2212 1 which sits in the short exact sequence\n0\n\n\u2732\n\nML\n\n\u2732\n\n\u0393(L) \u2297k OX\n\n\u2732\n\nL\n\n\u2732\n\n0.\n\n(\u2217)\n\nFor convenience, we record the following cohomological criteria which is a minor variant of\nTheorem 5.6 in [Ei2], Proposition 2.4 in [Gr3], or Lemma 1.6 in [EL].\nLemma 2.1. If H 1 (X , i ML \u2297F \u2297L j ) = 0 for all 1 6 i 6 p +1 and all j > 0, then the coherent OX -module F has a linear free resolution to stage p with respect to L. In characteristic\nV\nzero, i ML is a direct summand of MLi , so it suffices to show H 1 (X , MLi \u2297 F \u2297 L j ) = 0 for\nall 1 6 i 6 p + 1 and all j > 0.\n\u0003\nV\n\nSketch of Proof. The key observation is that the graded Betti numbers for the minimal free\nresolution of F can\nIf L is globally\n\u0001 be computed via Koszul cohomology.\n\u0001 generated and\nr\n0\n\u2217\nr\n\u2732\nP = P H (X , L) , then there is a morphism \u03c6\nP with \u03c6L OPr (1) = L. Since the\n\u0001L : X\n\u2217\n\u2732\n\u2732\n\u2732\nr\nr\nMOPr (1)\n\u0393 OP (1) \u2297k OP\nOPr (1) \u2732 0 is just (\u2217), the proof\npullback by \u03c6L of 0\nof Theorem 5.6 in [Ei2] goes through working on X instead of Pr .\n\u0003\nMultigraded Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity, as developed in [MS, \u00a76] or [HSS, \u00a72],\nallows us to exploit this criteria. To be more precise, fix a list B1 , . . ., Bl of globally generated\nline bundles on X . For a vector u := (u1 , . . . , ul ) \u2208 Zl , we set B u := Bu11 \u2297 * * * \u2297 Bul l and we\nwrite B := {B u : u \u2208 Nl } \u2282 Pic(X ) for the submonoid generated by these line bundles. If\n\n\fLINEAR DETERMINANTAL EQUATIONS\n\n5\n\ne1 , . . ., el is the standard basis for Zl then B e j = B j . A coherent OX -module F is said to\nbe regular with respect to B1 , . . . , Bl if H i (X , F \u2297 B \u2212u ) = 0 for all i > 0 and all u \u2208 Nl\nsatisfying |u| := u1 + * * * + ul = i. When l = 1, we recover the version of CastelnuovoMumford regularity found in [La2, \u00a71.8].\nAlthough the definition may not be intuitive, the next result shows that regular line bundles\nare at least ubiquitous.\nLemma 2.2. Let X be a scheme and let B1 , . . . , Bl be globally generated line bundles on X .\nIf there is a positive vector w \u2208 Zl such that B w is ample, then a sufficiently ample line\nbundle on X is regular with respect to B1 , . . ., Bl .\nThe hypothesis on w means that the cone pos(B1 , . . . , Bl ) generated by B1 , . . . , Bl contains\nan ample line bundle. In other words, the subcone pos(B1 , . . . , Bl ) of Nef(X ) has a nonempty\nintersection with the interior of Nef(X ).\nProof. It suffices to find a line bundle A on X such that, for any nef line bundle C, A \u2297C is\nregular with respect to B1 , . . ., Bl . Because B w is ample, Fujita's Vanishing Theorem (e.g.\nTheorem 1 in [Fu2]) implies that there is k \u2208 N such that, for any nef line bundle C, we have\nH i (X , B jw \u2297C) = 0 for all i > 0 and all j > k. Let n := dim X and consider A := B (k+n)w .\nSince w is positive, the line bundle B nw\u2212u is nef for all u \u2208 Nl with 0 6 |u| 6 n. Therefore,\nwe have H i (X , (A \u2297 C) \u2297 B \u2212u ) = H i (X , B kw \u2297 (B nw\u2212u \u2297 C)) = 0 for all i > 0 and all\nu \u2208 Nl satisfying |u| = i.\n\u0003\nBefore describing the pivotal results in this section, we record a technical lemma bounding\nthe regularity of certain tensor products. Our approach is a hybrid of Proposition 1.8.9 and\nRemark 1.8.16 in [La2].\nLemma 2.3. Let X be a scheme of dimension n and F be a coherent OX -module. Fix a\nvector bundle V and a globally generated ample line bundle B on X .

We first prove that ML \u2297 Bm is regular with respect to B. Tensoring (\u2217) with Bm\u2212i and\ntaking the associated long exact sequence gives\n\u0393(L) \u2297 H 0 (X , Bm\u2212i)\n\u2732\n\n\u2732\n\nH 0 (X , L \u2297 Bm\u2212i )\n\nH i\u22121 (X , L \u2297 Bm\u2212i )\n\n\u2732\n\n\u2732\n\nH 1 (X , ML \u2297 Bm\u2212i ) \u2732 * * *\n\nH i (X , ML \u2297 Bm\u2212i )\n\n\u2732\n\n\u0393(L) \u2297 H i (X , Bm\u2212i ) .\n\nSince L is regular with respect to B, Mumford's Lemma (e.g. Theorem 1.8.5 in [La2]) shows\nthat, for all k \u2208 N, the map \u0393(L) \u2297 H 0 (X , Bk ) \u2732 H 0 (X , L \u2297 Bk ) is surjective and, for all\ni > 0 and all k \u2208 N, we have H i (X , L \u2297 Bk\u2212i ) = 0. As m is a positive integer, the map\n\u0393(L) \u2297 H 0 (X , Bm\u22121) \u2732 H 0 (X , L \u2297 Bm\u22121 ) is surjective and H i\u22121 (X , L \u2297 Bm\u2212i ) = 0 for all\ni > 1. Since Bm is also regular with respect to B, we have H i (X , Bm\u2212i ) = 0 for all i > 0. It\nfollows that H i (X , ML \u2297 Bm\u2212i ) = 0 for all i > 0.\nBy Lemma 2.1, it suffices to show that, for all j \u2208 N, we have H 1 (X , ML \u2297 Bw \u2297 L j ) =\n0 and H 1 (X , ML2 \u2297 Bw \u2297 L j ) = 0. Thus, it suffices to show that the vector bundles ML \u2297\nBw+1 \u2297 L j and ML2 \u2297 Bw+1 \u2297 L j are both regular with respect to B. If w > (m \u2212 1)n, then\nLemma 2.3 implies that (ML \u2297 Bm ) \u2297 L j \u2297 Bw+1\u2212m = ML \u2297 Bw+1 \u2297 L j is regular with respect\nto B.

We first prove that ML \u2297 F is regular with respect to B1 , . . . , Bl. Tensoring (\u2217) with\nF \u2297 B \u2212u and taking the associated long exact sequence gives\n\u0393(L) \u2297 H 0 (X , F \u2297 B \u2212u )\n\n\u2732\n\nH 0 (X , F \u2297 B m\u2212u )\n\nH i\u22121 (X , F \u2297 B m\u2212u )\n\n\u2732\n\nH i (X , ML \u2297 F \u2297 B \u2212u )\n\n\u2732\n\n\u2732\n\nH 1 (X , ML \u2297 F \u2297 B \u2212u ) \u2732 * * *\n\u2732\n\n\u0393(L) \u2297 H i (X , F \u2297 B \u2212u ) .\n\nSince F is regular with respect to B1 , . . ., Bl , Theorem 2.1 in [HSS] shows that, for all i > 0\nand all u, v \u2208 Nl with |u| = i, H i (X , F \u2297 B v\u2212u ) = 0. As B m\u2212e j \u2208 B for 1 6 j 6 l, we see\nthat H i\u22121 (X , F \u2297 B m\u2212u ) = 0 for all i > 1 and all u \u2208 Nl satisfying |u| = i.

It\nfollows that H i (X , ML \u2297 F \u2297 B \u2212u ) = 0 for all i > 0 and all u \u2208 Nl such that |u| = i.\nBy Lemma 2.1, it suffices to show that H 1 (X , ML \u2297 F \u2297 L j ) and H 1 (X , ML2 \u2297 F \u2297 L j ) are\nzero for j \u2208 N. Since ML \u2297 F is regular with respect to B1 , . . . , Bl, the vanishing of the first\ngroup follows from Theorem 2.1 in [HSS]. For the second, tensoring (\u2217) with ML \u2297 F \u2297 L j\ngives the exact sequence:\n\u0393(L) \u2297 H 0 (X , ML \u2297 F \u2297 L j )\n\n\u2732\n\nH 0 (X , ML \u2297 F \u2297 L j+1 )\n\n\u2732\n\nH 1 (X , ML2 \u2297 F \u2297 L j ) \u2732 0 .\n\nBecause ML \u2297 F is regular with respect to B1 , . . . , Bl, Theorem 2.1 in [HSS] also shows that\nthe left map is surjective for all j > 0.\n\u0003\nOur third proposition is a variant of Proposition 3.1 in [EL].\nProposition 2.6. Let X be a smooth variety of dimension n, let KX be its \u0001canonical bundle,\nand let A be a very ample line bundle on X such that (X , A) 6= Pn , OPn (1) . Suppose that B\nand C are nef line bundles on X .

D ETERMINANTALLY P RESENTED L INE BUNDLES\nThe goal of this section is to prove Theorem 1.1. We realize this goal by developing general\nmethods for showing that a line bundle is determinantally presented; see Theorem 3.2.\nSuppose that X \u2282 Pr is embedded by the complete linear series for a line bundle L. Factor\nL as L = E \u2297 E \u2032 for some E, E \u2032 \u2208 Pic(X ) and let \u03bcE,E \u2032 : H 0 (X , E) \u2297 H 0(X , E \u2032 ) \u2732 H 0 (X , L)\ndenote the natural multiplication map. Choose ordered bases y1 , . . ., ys and z1 , . . ., zt for the\nk-vector spaces H 0 (X , E) and H 0 (X , E \u2032 ) respectively. Define \u03a9 = \u03a9(E, E \u2032) to be the associated (s \u00d7t)-matrix [\u03bcE,E \u2032 (yi \u2297 z j )] of linear forms. Its ideal I2 (\u03a9) of 2-minors is independent\nof the choice of bases. Proposition 6.10 in [Ei2] shows that \u03a9 is 1-generic and that I2 (\u03a9)\nvanishes on X .\nInspired by [EKS, \u00a72], the key technical result is:\nLemma 3.1. If L is a very ample line bundle on X satisfying N1 and {(Ei , Ei\u2032 )} is a family of\nfactorizations for L, then the commutative diagram (z) has exact rows and columns. Moreover, if \u03c6 2 is surjective, then the homogeneous ideal IX|Pr is generated by the 2-minors of the\nmatrices \u03a9(Ei , Ei\u2032 ) if and only if Q2 surjects onto Q1 .\nProof. To begin,\nwe prove the columns are exact. Since L satisfies N0 (i.e. the natural maps\n\u0001\n\u2732\nSym j \u0393(L)\nH 0 (X , L j ) are surjective for all j \u2208 N), the ideal IX|Pr is the kernel of the\nmap from the homogeneous coordinate ring of Pr to the section ring of L.

By definition, Q1 and\nQ2 are the kernels of the \u03c61 and \u03c6 2 respectively, and \u03c8 is the induced map between them.\nWe next identify the horizontal maps. By applying the functor Sym2 to \u03bcEi ,Ei\u2032 , we ob\u0001\n\u0001\ntain a map from Sym2 \u0393(Ei ) \u2297 \u0393(Ei\u2032 ) to Sym2 \u0393(L) for each i; \u03c6 2 is their direct sum.\nThe composite map \u03bcL,L \u25e6 (\u03bcEi ,Ei\u2032 \u2297 \u03bcEi ,Ei\u2032 ) : \u0393(Ei ) \u2297 \u0393(Ei\u2032 ) \u2297 \u0393(Ei ) \u2297 \u0393(Ei\u2032 ) \u2732 \u0393(L2 ) factors\n\u0001\n\u0001\nthrough Sym\u00012 \u0393(Ei ) \u2297 Sym\u00012 \u0393(Ei\u2032 ) , and \u03c61 is the direct sum of the associated maps from\nSym2 \u0393(Ei ) \u2297 Sym2 \u0393(Ei\u2032 ) to \u0393(L2 ). The map \u03c6 is induced by \u03c6 2 . From (\u2020), we see that\nthe image of \u03c6 is generated by the 2-minors of the matrices \u03a9(Ei , Ei\u2032 ).\nFinally, the line bundle L satisfies N1 , so the quadratic component (IX|Pr )2 generates the\nentire ideal IX|Pr . Hence, the image of \u03c6 generates the ideal IX|Pr if and only if \u03c6 is surjective. Since \u03c62 is surjective, the Snake Lemma (e.g. Lemma 1.3.2 in [Wei]) shows that the\n\u0003\nsurjectivity of \u03c6 is equivalent to the surjectivity of \u03c8 .\nOur main application for Lemma 3.1 focuses on a single factorization of the line bundle L.\nThe proof follows the strategy in [EKS, \u00a72].\nTheorem 3.2. Let L be a very ample line bundle on a scheme X satisfying N1 . If L = E \u2297 E \u2032\nfor some nontrivial E, E \u2032 \u2208 Pic(X ) and the following conditions hold\n(a) E has a linear presentation with respect to E \u2032 ,\n(b) E \u2032 has a linear presentation with respect to E,\n(c) E 2 has a linear presentation with respect to E \u2032 ,\n(d) both E and E \u2032 satisfy N0 ,\n\u0001\nthen the 2-minors of the matrix \u03a9(E, E \u2032) generate the homogeneous ideal of X in P \u0393(L) .\nIn particular, the line bundle L is determinantally presented.\n\n\fLINEAR DETERMINANTAL EQUATIONS\n\n9\n\nProof.

Similarly, Step (iv) implies that the\nmap Ker(\u03bcE,E \u2032 ) \u2297 \u0393(E) \u2297 \u0393(E \u2032 ) \u2732 \u0393(E) \u2297 \u0393(E) \u2297 Ker(\u03b7 \u2032 ) is surjective. Therefore, it is\nenough to establish the four steps.\nFor Step (i), Condition (c) implies that Ker(\u03bcE 2 ,E \u2032 ), the span of the linear relations on\n\u0001\nL\n0\n2\n\u2032j\n\u2032\nj>0 H (X , E \u2297 E ) regarded as a Sym \u0393(E ) -module, generates the relations in higher\ndegrees as well. Hence, Ker(\u03bcE 2 ,E \u2032 ) \u2297 \u0393(E \u2032 ) maps onto the quadratic relations which are\nthe kernel of the composite map \u03bcE 2 ,E \u20322 \u25e6 (1\u0393(E 2 ) \u2297 \u03b7 \u2032 ). Since this kernel is generated by\n\u0393(E 2 ) \u2297 Ker(\u03b7 \u2032 ) and the pullback of Ker(\u03bcE 2 ,E \u2032 2 ), Condition (d) implies that \u03b7 \u2032 is surjective,\nand we have established Step (i).\nTo complete the proof, we simultaneously establish Steps (ii) and (iii); the symmetric\n\u2032\nargument yields Step (iv). Condition (b) implies that\n\u0001 Ker(\u03bcE,E ) generates all the relations\nL\n0\n\u2032\nj\non j>0 H (X , E \u2297 E ) regarded as a Sym \u0393(E) -module. In particular, the vector space\nKer(\u03bcE,E \u2032 ) \u2297 \u0393(E) maps onto the quadratic relations which are the kernel of the composite\nmap \u03bcE 2 ,E \u2032 \u25e6 (\u03b7 \u2297 1\u0393(E \u2032 ) ). This kernel is generated by Ker(\u03b7 ) \u2297 \u0393(E \u2032 ) and the pullback of\nKer(\u03bcE 2 ,E \u2032 ). Condition (d) implies that \u03b7 is surjective, so Step (ii) and Step (iii) follow. \u0003\nAs the proof indicates, Theorem 3.2 holds under a weaker version of Condition (d). Specifically, it is only necessary that \u03b7 and \u03b7 \u2032 are surjective. Nevertheless, in all of our applications,\na stronger condition is satisfied: both E and E satisfy N1 .\nThis theorem leads to a description, given in terms of Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity,\nfor some determinantally presented line bundles on any projective scheme.\n\n\f10\n\nJ. SIDMAN AND G.G. SMITH\n\nCorollary 3.3. Let X be a connected scheme and let B1 , . . . , Bl be globally generated line\nbundles on X for which there exists w \u2208 Nl such that B w is ample. If B m is regular with\nrespect to B1 , . . . , Bl for m \u2208 Nl and B 2m is very ample, then the line bundle B 2m+u is\ndeterminantally presented for any u \u2208 Nl .\nProof. Factor L := B 2m+u as L = E \u2297 E \u2032 where E := B m and E \u2032 := B m+u . Theorem 2.1\nin [HSS] shows that L, E, E 2 , and E \u2032 are all regular with respect to B1 , . . . , Bl . Hence,\nProposition 2.5 together with Theorem 2.1 in [HSS] imply that L, E, and E \u2032 satisfy N1 , that\nE \u2032 has a linear free presentation with respect to E, and that both E and E 2 have a linear\nfree presentation with respect to E \u2032 . Therefore, Theorem 3.2 proves that L is determinantally\npresented.\n\u0003\nTheorem 3.2, combined with results from \u00a72, also yields a proof for our main theorem.\nProof of Theorem 1.1. Let X be a connected scheme of dimension n and let B be a globally\ngenerated ample line bundle on X . Choose a positive integer m \u2208 N such that Bm is regular\nwith respect to B. Lemma 2.2 implies that there exists a line bundle E, which we may\nassume is very ample, such that, for any nef line bundle C, E \u2297C is regular with respect to\nB. By replacing E with E \u2297 B if necessary, we may assume that the map \u0393(B) \u2297 H 0 (X , E \u2297\nB\u22121 ) \u2732 H 0 (X , E) is surjective. Since a sufficiently ample line bundle on X satisfies N1\n(combine Lemmata 1.1\u20131.3 in [I] with Fujita's Vanishing Theorem), we may also assume\nthat, for any nef line bundle C, E \u2297C satisfies N1 .\nConsider the line bundle A := E \u2297 B2(m\u22121)n+1 . If L is a line bundle on X such that L \u2297 A\u22121\nis nef, then L = A \u2297C = (E \u2297C) \u2297 B2(m\u22121)n+1 for some nef line bundle C. Our choice of E\nguarantees that, for all j > 1, (E \u2297 C) j is regular with respect to B, and that L satisfies N1 .\nHence, Proposition 2.4 implies that B2(m\u22121)n+1 has a linear free presentation with respect to\nE \u2297C. Proposition 2.5 together with Mumford's Lemma (e.g. Theorem 1.8.5 in [La2]) imply\nthat both E \u2297C and (E \u2297C)2 have a linear free presentation with respect to B2(m\u22121)n+1 . Via\nLemma 2.3 and Proposition 2.5, B2(m\u22121)n+1 satisfies N1 . Therefore, Theorem 3.2 proves that\nL is determinantally presented.\n\u0003\n4. E FFECTIVE B OUNDS\nIn this section, we give effective bounds for determinantally presented line bundles. As a basic philosophy, one can convert explicit conditions for line bundles to satisfy N2 into effective\ndescriptions for determinantally presented line bundles. The three subsections demonstrate\nthis philosophy for products of projective spaces, projective Gorenstein toric varieties, and\nsmooth varieties. Despite not being developed here, we expect similar results for general\nsurfaces and abelian varieties following [GP] and [Rub, PP] respectively.\n4.1. P RODUCTS OF P ROJECTIVE S PACE . The tools from \u00a73 lead to a description of the\ndeterminantally presented ample line bundles on a product of projective spaces. In contrast with Theorem 3.11 in [Ber] which proves that Segre-Veronese varieties are defined by\n\n\fLINEAR DETERMINANTAL EQUATIONS\n\n11\n\n2-minors of an appropriate hypermatrix, our classification shows that a Segre-Veronese variety is typically generated by the 2-minors of a single matrix. In particular, we recover the\nSegre-Veronese ideals considered in [Sul, \u00a76.2].\nTo study the product of projective spaces X = Pn1 \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 Pnl , we first introduce some\nnotation. Let R := k[xi, j : 1 6 i 6 l, 0 6 j 6 ni ] be the total coordinate ring (a.k.a. Cox\nl -grading induced by deg(x ) := e \u2208 Zl . Hence,\nring) of X ; this polynomial\ni, j\ni\n\u0001 ring has the Z\nl\nwe have Rd = \u0393 OX (d) for all d \u2208 Z and a torus-invariant global section of OX (d) is\nidentified with a monomial xw \u2208 Rd where w \u2208 Nr and r := \u2211li=1 (ni + 1). We write ei, j for\nthe standard basis of Zr ; in particular xei, j = xi, j .\nTheorem 4.1. Let X = Pn1 \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 Pnl . An ample line bundle OX (m) is determinantally\npresented if at least l \u2212 2 of the entries in the vector m are at least 2.\nWhen l = 2, this theorem shows that all of the Segre-Veronese embeddings are determinantally presented. We note that Corollary 3.3 establishes that OX (m) is determinantally\npresented when m j > 2 for all 1 6 j 6 l.\n\nProof. Since a line bundle OX (v) is ample (and very ample) if and only if v j > 1 for all\n1 6 j 6 l, Corollary 1.5 in [HSS] shows that OX (m) satisfies N1 . Without loss of generality,\nwe may assume that m j > 2 for 1 6 j 6 l\u22122. Factor OX (m) as OX (m) = E \u2297E \u2032 where u :=\ne1 + e2 + * * * + el\u22121 = (1, 1, . . ., 1, 0), E\u0001:= OX (u), and E \u2032 := OX (m \u2212 u). The canonical\nsurjection \u0393(E) \u2297 \u0393(E \u2032 ) \u2732 \u0393 OX (m) implies that the map \u03c6 2 in (z) is surjective. By\nLemma 3.1, it suffices prove that the map \u03c8 : Q2 \u2732 Q1 is surjective. A slight modification\nthat Q1 = Ker(\u03c61 ) is generated by 'binomial'\nto the proof of Lemma\u00014.1 in [Stu] shows\n\u0001\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\nelements in Sym2 \u0393(E) \u2297Sym2 \u0393(E ) of the form xa xb \u2297xc xd \u2212xa xb \u2297xc xd where\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\nxa , xb , xa , xb \u2208 \u0393(E), xc , xd , xc , xd \u2208 \u0393(E \u2032 ), and a + b + c + d = a\u2032 + b\u2032 + c\u2032 + d\u2032 . Thus,\nthe two terms in each such binomial differ by exchanging variables among the various factors.\nSince every such binomial element is the sum of binomials that each exchange a single pair\nof variables, it suffices to consider the following two cases.\nIn the first case, the pair of variables are exchanged between a section of E and a section\nE \u2032 . In particular, there exists some 1 6 k 6 l \u2212 1 such that the binomial element has the form\nxa xb \u2297xc xd \u2212xa\u2212ek,\u03b1 +ek,\u03b3 xb \u2297xc+ek,\u03b1 \u2212ek,\u03b3 xd where a\u2212ek,\u03b1 and c\u2212ek,\u03b3 are nonnegative.\na\u2212ek,\u03b1 +ek,\u03b3\nThis element is the image of (xa \u2297 xc )(xb \u2297 xd ) \u2212\n\u2297 xc+ek,\u03b1 \u2212ek,\u03b3 )(xb \u2297 xd )\n\u0001 (x\n\u2032\nwhich lies in Q2 = Ker(\u03c6 2 ) \u2282 Sym2 \u0393(E) \u2297 \u0393(E ) .\nIn the second case, we may assume that the pair of variables are exchanged between two\nsections of E \u2032 , as exchanging variables between two sections of E is analogous. More precisely, let xk,\u03b3 and xk,\u03b4 for some 1 6 k 6 l denote the exchanged variables and consider the binomial element xa xb \u2297 xc xd \u2212 xa xb \u2297 xc\u2212ek,\u03b3 +ek,\u03b4 xd+ek,\u03b3 \u2212ek,\u03b4 where c \u2212 ek,\u03b3 and d \u2212 ek,\u03b4\n\u0001\n\u0001\nare nonnegative. Since xa xb \u2297 xc xd = xa xb \u2297 xd xc in Sym2 \u0393(E) \u2297 Sym2 \u0393(E \u2032 ) , we\nmay also assume that k < l. Hence, there is a variable xk,\u03b1 such that a \u2212 ek,\u03b1 is nonnegative\n\n\f12\n\nJ. SIDMAN AND G.G. SMITH\n\nand\nxa xb \u2297 xc xd \u2212 xa xb \u2297 xc\u2212ek,\u03b3 +ek,\u03b4 xd+ek,\u03b3 \u2212ek,\u03b4\n= xa xb \u2297 xc xd \u2212 xa\u2212ek,\u03b1 +ek,\u03b4 xb \u2297 xc xd+ek,\u03b1 \u2212ek,\u03b4\n+xa\u2212ek,\u03b1 +ek,\u03b4 xb \u2297 xc xd+ek,\u03b1 \u2212ek,\u03b4 \u2212 xa\u2212ek,\u03b1 +ek,\u03b3 xb \u2297 xc\u2212ek,\u03b3 +ek,\u03b4 xd+ek,\u03b1 \u2212ek,\u03b4\n+xa\u2212ek,\u03b1 +ek,\u03b3 xb \u2297 xc\u2212ek,\u03b3 +ek,\u03b4 xd+ek,\u03b1 \u2212ek,\u03b4 \u2212 xa xb \u2297 xc\u2212ek,\u03b3 +ek,\u03b4 xd+ek,\u03b3 \u2212ek,\u03b4 .\nIn other words, the binomial element under consideration is a sum of binomials in which\nvariables are exchanged between sections of E and E \u2032 . Hence, the first case shows that this\nbinomial element lies in the image of Q2 .\nWe conclude that \u03c8 is surjective and OX (m) is determinantally presented.\n\u0003\nThe next proposition shows that Theorem 4.1 is optimal when l = 3. In fact, our experiments in Macaulay2 [M2] suggest that Theorem 4.1 is always sharp.\nProposition 4.2. If X = Pn1 \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 Pnl with l > 3, then the ample line bundle OX (1) is not\ndeterminantally presented.\nProof. Any nontrivial factorization of OX (1) has the form E \u2297 E \u2032 where E := OX (u)\n\u0001 for\nl\n\u2032\nsome u \u2208 {0,\u00011} and E := OX (1 \u2212 u). For a suitable choice\n\u0001 of bases for \u0393 OX (u) and\n\u0393 OX (1 \u2212 u) , the associated matrix \u03a9 OX (u), OX (1 \u2212 u) is the generic (s \u00d7 t)-matrix\nwith s := \u2211ui 6=0 (ni + 1) and t := \u2211li=0 (ni + 1) \u2212 s. Since the 2-minors of a generic (s \u00d7 t)matrix define Ps\u22121 \u00d7 Pt\u22121 in its Segre embedding, we see that OX (1) is not determinantally\npresented when l > 3.\n\u0003\nExample 4.3. Consider the variety X = P1 \u00d7 P1 \u00d7 P1 embedded in P11 = Proj(k[y0 , . . . , y11 ])\nby the complete linear series of OX (2, 1, 1). If R = k[x1,0 , x1,1 , x2,0 , x2,1 , x3,0 , x3,1 ] is the total\ncoordinate ring of X , then the twelve monomials\n\uf8f1 2\n\uf8fc\nx21,0 x2,0 x3,1 ,\nx21,0 x2,1 x3,0 ,\nx21,0 x2,1 x3,1 , \uf8fd\n\uf8f2 x1,0 x2,0 x3,0 ,\nx1,0 x1,1 x2,0 x3,0 , x1,0 x1,1 x2,0 x3,1 , x1,0 x1,1 x2,1 x3,0 , x1,0 x1,1 x2,1 x3,1 ,\n\uf8f3 2\n\uf8fe\nx1,1 x2,0 x3,0 ,\nx21,1 x2,0 x3,1 ,\nx21,1 x2,1 x3,0 ,\nx21,1 x2,1 x3,1\n\u0001\ngive an ordered basis for \u0393 OX (2, 1, 1) . The homogeneous ideal IX|P11 is the toric ideal\nassociated to these monomials and is minimally generated by thirty three quadrics. Choosing\n{x1,0 x2,0 , x1,0 x2,1 ,\u0001x1,1 x2,0 , x1,1 x2,1 } and\n\u0001 {x1,0 x3,0 , x1,0 x3,1 , x1,1 x3,0 ,\u0001x1,1 x3,1 } as ordered bases\nfor \u0393 OX (1, 1, 0) and \u0393 OX (1, 0, 1) , \u03a9 OX (1, 1, 0), OX (1, 0, 1) is\n\uf8f9\n\uf8ee\ny0 y1 y4 y5\n\uf8efy2 y3 y6 y7 \uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8ef\n\uf8f0y4 y5 y8 y9 \uf8fb\ny6 y7 y10 y11\nand one may verify that the 2-minors of this matrix generates the ideal of X , so OX (2, 1, 1)\nis determinantally presented.\n\u22c4\n\n\fLINEAR DETERMINANTAL EQUATIONS\n\n13\n\nHowever, if we consider multiple factorizations of a very ample line bundle on a product of\nprojective spaces, then we do obtain a convenient expression of the homogeneous ideal as the\n2-minors of matrices. This perspective give a conceptual explanation for both Theorem 2.6\nin [H\u00e0] and Theorem 3.11 in [Ber].\n\u0001\nProposition 4.4. If X = Pn1 \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 Pnl , then the homogeneous \u0001ideal of X in P OX (d) is\ngenerated by the 2-minors of the matrices \u03a9 OX (ei ), OX (d \u2212 ei ) where 1 6 i 6 l.\nProof. Given Theorem 4.1, we may assume that l > 3. For brevity, set Ei := O\u0001X (ei ) and\nEi\u2032 := OX (d \u2212 ei ) where 1 6 i 6 l. Since \u0393(Ei ) \u2297 \u0393(Ei\u2032 ) surjects onto \u0393 OX (d) , the map\n\u03c6 2 in (z) is surjective, and it suffices prove that the map \u03c8 : Q2 \u2732 Q1 is surjective. By an\nabuse of notation, we use \u03b5i to denote the canonical inclusion map onto the i-th summand\nfor all three of the direct sums appearing in the middle column of (z). As\n\u0001 in the proof\u2032 of\n\u0001\nLl\nTheorem 4.1, Q1 is generated by binomial elements in k=1 Sym2 \u0393(Ek ) \u2297 Sym2 \u0393(Ek ) .\nGenerators have the form \u03b5i (xi,\u03b1 xi,\u03b2 \u2297 xc xd ) \u2212 \u03b5 j (x j,\u03b3 x j,\u03b4 \u2297 xa xb ) where xi,\u03b1 , xi,\u03b2 \u2208 \u0393(Ei ),\nxc , xd \u2208 \u0393(Ei\u2032 ), x j,\u03b3 , x j,\u03b4 \u2208 \u0393(E j ), xa , xb \u2208 \u0393(E \u2032j ) and ei,\u03b1 +ei,\u03b2 +c+d = a+b+e j,\u03b3 +e j,\u03b4 .\nWe consider the following two cases.\nIn the first case, we have i = j. Since every binomial element is the sum of binomials\nthat each exchange a single pair of variables, it suffices\u0001 to consider an element of the form\n\u03b5i xi,\u03b1 xi,\u03b2 \u2297 xc xd \u2212 xi,\u03b1 xi,\u03b2 \u2297 xc\u2212ek,\u03b3 +ek,\u03b4 xd+ek,\u03b3 \u2212ek,\u03b4 where 1 6 k 6 l and both c \u2212 ek,\u03b3\nand d \u2212 ek,\u03b4 are nonnegative. This element is the image of\n\n\u03b5i (xi,\u03b1 \u2297 xc )(xi,\u03b2 \u2297 xd ) \u2212 (xi,\u03b1 \u2297 xc\u2212ek,\u03b3 +ek,\u03b4 )(xi,\u03b2 \u2297 xd+ek,\u03b3 \u2212ek,\u03b4 )\n\n\u0001\n\n\u0001\n\u2212 \u03b5k (xk,\u03b3 \u2297 xc+ei,\u03b1 \u2212ek,\u03b3 )(xk,\u03b4 \u2297 xd+ei,\u03b2 \u2212ek,\u03b4 ) \u2212 (xk,\u03b4 \u2297 xc+ei,\u03b1 \u2212ek,\u03b3 )(xk,\u03b3 \u2297 xd+ei,\u03b2 \u2212ek,\u03b4 ) ,\nwhich lies in Q2 = Ker(\u03c6 2 ).\nFor the second case, we have i 6= j. We may assume that the binomial element has the\nform \u03b5i (xi,\u03b1 xi,\u03b2 \u2297xc xd ) \u2212 \u03b5 j (x j,\u03b3 x j,\u03b4 \u2297xc+ei,\u03b1 \u2212e j,\u03b3 xd+ei,\u03b2 \u2212e j,\u03b4 ), where c\u2212e j,\u03b3 and d \u2212e j,\u03b4\nare nonnegative, because any additional exchanges of variables can be obtained by adding\nelements from the first case. This element is the image of\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u03b5i (xi,\u03b1 \u2297 xc )(xi,\u03b2 \u2297 xd ) \u2212 \u03b5 j (x j,\u03b3 \u2297 xc+ei,\u03b1 \u2212e j,\u03b3 )(x j,\u03b4 \u2297 xd+ei,\u03b2 \u2212e j,\u03b4 ) ,\nwhich lies in Q2 = Ker(\u03c6 2 ).\n\n\u0003\n\nExample 4.5. Consider the variety X = P1 \u00d7 P1 \u00d7 P1 embedded in P7 = Proj(k[y0 , . . . , y7 ])\nby the complete linear series of the line bundle OX (1, 1, 1). The homogeneous ideal IX|P7 is\nthe toric ideal associated to the monomial list\n\u001a\n\u001b\nx1,0 x2,0 x3,0 , x1,0 x2,0 x3,1 , x1,0 x2,1 x3,0 , x1,0 x2,1 x3,1 ,\nx1,1 x2,0 x3,0 , x1,1 x2,0 x3,1 , x1,1 x2,1 x3,0 , x1,1 x2,1 x3,1\n\n\f14\n\nJ. SIDMAN AND G.G. SMITH\n\nand is minimally generated by nine quadrics. Choosing appropriate monomials for the ordered bases of the global sections, we obtain\n\u0015\n\u0014\n\u0001\ny0 y1 y2 y3\n,\n\u03a9 OX (1, 0, 0), OX (0, 1, 1) =\ny4 y5 y6 y7\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u0001\ny0 y1 y4 y5\n\u03a9 OX (0, 1, 0), OX (1, 0, 1) =\n,\ny2 y3 y6 y7\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u0001\ny0 y2 y4 y6\n\u03a9 OX (0, 0, 1), OX (1, 1, 0) =\n.\ny1 y3 y5 y7\nIt follows that OX (1, 1, 1) is not determinantally presented, but one easily verifies that the\nideal IX|P7 is generated by the 2-minors of all three matrices.\n\u22c4\nMultiple factorizations of a very ample line bundle allow one to describe a larger number\nof homogeneous ideals via 2-minors. With this in mind, it would be interesting to write down\nthe analogue of Theorem 3.2 for multiple factorizations of the line bundle.\n4.2. TORIC VARIETIES . In addition to the bound given in Corollary 3.3, there is an effective\nbound for toric varieties involving adjoint bundles for toric varieties; cf. Corollary 1.6 in\n[HSS]. Recall that a line bundle on a toric variety X is nef if and only if it is globally\ngenerated, and the dualizing sheaf KX is a line bundle if and only if X is Gorenstein.\nProposition 4.6. Let X be a projective n-dimensional Gorenstein toric variety with dualizing\nsheaf KX , and let B1 , . . ., Bl be the minimal generators of its nef cone Nef(X ). Suppose that\n\u2032\nm, m\u2032 \u2208 Nl satisfy B m\u2212u , B m \u2212u \u2208 B for all u \u2208 Nl with |u| 6 n + 1. If X 6= Pn and\n\u2032\nw \u2208 Nl , then L = KX2 \u2297 B m+m +w is determinantally presented.\n\u2032\n\nProof. Factor L as L = E \u2297 E \u2032 where E := KX \u2297 B m+w and E \u2032 := KX \u2297 B m . Since\n\u2032\nB m\u2212(n+1)e j , B m \u2212(n+1)e j \u2208 B, Corollary 0.2 in [Fu1] implies that E \u2297B \u2212e j and E \u2032 \u2297B \u2212e j\nbelong to B for all 1 6 j 6 l. For any torus invariant curve Y , there is a B e j such that\nB e j * Y > 0. Theorem 3.4 in [Mus] implies that E, E 2 and E \u2032 are regular with respect to\nB1 , . . . , Bl . Hence, Proposition 2.5 shows that L, E, and E \u2032 satisfy N1 , and that E has a linear\nfree presentation with respect to E \u2032 , E \u2032 has a linear free presentation with respect to E, and\nE 2 has a linear free presentation with respect to E \u2032 . Therefore, Theorem 3.2 shows that L is\ndeterminantally presented.\n\u0003\nProof of Theorem 1.3 for toric varieties. This is a special case of Proposition 4.6.\n\n\u0003\n\nWe give an example showing that Theorem 1.3 is not sharp for all toric varieties.\nExample 4.7. Consider the toric del Pezzo surface X obtained by blowing up P2 at the three\ntorus-fixed points. Let R := k[x0 , . . . , x5 ] be the total coordinate ring of X . The anticanonical\nbundle KX\u22121 is very ample and corresponds to polygon\n\b\nP := conv (1, 0), (1, 1), (0, 1), (\u22121, 0), (\u22121, \u22121), (0, \u22121) .\n\n\fLINEAR DETERMINANTAL EQUATIONS\n\n15\n\nIt is easy to see that the polygon P is the smallest lattice polygon with its inner normal fan.\nThe polygon 2P contains 19 lattice points. The corresponding monomials\n\uf8fc\n\uf8f1 4 4 2 2\n4 x3 x x x3 ,\n4 x2 x2 x4 ,\n3 x4 x3 x x ,\n3 x3 x2 x x x2 ,\nx\nx\nx\nx\n,\nx\nx\nx\nx\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n2\n4\n3\n3\n4\n5\n0\n1\n2\n0\n2\n0\n1\n4\n1\n5\n1\n5\n5\n0\n2\n0\n1\n5\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8fd\n\uf8f2 3 2\nx0 x1 x2 x3 x24 x35 , x30 x1 x3 x34 x45 , x20 x41 x42 x23 , x20 x31 x32 x23 x4 x5 , x20 x21 x22 x23 x24 x25 ,\nx2 x x x2 x3 x3 , x20 x23 x44 x45 , x0 x31 x42 x33 x4 , x0 x21 x32 x33 x24 x5 , x0 x1 x22 x33 x34 x25 ,\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8fe\n\uf8f3 0 1 2334435\nx0 x2 x3 x4 x5 ,\nx21 x42 x43 x24 , x1 x32 x43 x34 x5 ,\nx22 x43 x44 x25\n\u0001\nembed X into P18 = Proj k[y0 , . . . , y18 ] . The homogeneous ideal IX|P18 is the toric ideal\nassociated to these monomials and is minimally generated by 129 quadrics. Choosing\n{x20 x21 x2 x5 , x20 x1 x4 x25 , x0 x21 x22 x3 , x0 x1 x2 x3 x4 x5 , x0 x3 x24 x25 , x1 x22 x23 x4 , x2 x23 x24 x5 } as an ordered ba\u0001\nsis for \u0393(KX\u22121 ), the matrix \u03a9 KX\u22121 , KX\u22121 is\n\uf8f9\n\uf8ee\ny0 y1 y3 y4 y5 y8 y9\n\uf8efy1 y2 y4 y5 y6 y9 y10 \uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8ef\n\uf8efy3 y4 y7 y8 y9 y12 y13 \uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8ef\n\uf8efy4 y5 y8 y9 y10 y13 y14 \uf8fa ,\n\uf8fa\n\uf8ef\n\uf8efy5 y6 y9 y10 y11 y14 y15 \uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8ef\n\uf8f0y8 y9 y12 y13 y14 y16 y17 \uf8fb\ny9 y10 y13 y14 y15 y17 y18\nand its 2-minors generate IX|P18 . However, Theorem 1.3 only establishes that the line bundle\nKX\u22124 = KX2 \u2297 (KX\u22121 )2*2+2 is determinantally presented.\n\u22c4\n4.3. S MOOTH VARIETIES . For smooth varieties, we also have an effective bound for adjoint\nbundles; see Theorem 1.3.\nProof of Theorem 1.3 for smooth varieties. Factor the line bundle L as L = E \u2297 E \u2032 where\nE := KX \u2297 An+1 and E \u2032 := KX \u2297 A j\u2212n\u22121 \u2297 B. Since j > 2n + 2 and E is nef (see Example 1.5.35 in [La2]), Proposition 2.6 implies that L, E, and E \u2032 satisfy N1 , E has a linear free\npresentation with respect to E \u2032 , E \u2032 has a linear free presentation with respect to E, and E 2\nhas a linear free presentation with respect to E \u2032 . Therefore, Theorem 3.2 shows that L is\ndeterminantally presented.\n\u0003\nWe end with an example showing that the hypotheses in Theorem 1.3 are optimal without\nfurther restrictions on the varieties under consideration.\nExample 4.8. Consider the Grassmannian X = Gr(2, 4) parametrizing all two dimensional\nsubspaces of the vector space k4 . Let OX (1) denote the determinant of the universal rank 2\nsub-bundle on X . The associated complete linear series determines the Pl\u00fccker embedding of\nX into P5 = Proj(k[x1,2 , x1,3 , x1,4 , x2,3 , x2,4 , x3,4 ]). Since IX|P5 = hx1,2 x3,4 \u2212 x1,3 x2,4 + x2,3 x1,4 i,\nit follows that OX (1) is not determinantally presented. On the other hand, the monomials\n\uf8fc\n\uf8f1 2\nx1,2 x1,3 , x1,2 x1,4 , x1,2 x2,3 , x1,2 x2,4 , x1,2 x3,4 ,\nx21,3 , \uf8fd\n\uf8f2 x1,2 ,\nx1,4 x2,3 , x1,4 x2,4 ,\nx1,3 x1,4 , x1,3 x2,3 ,\nx1,3 x3,4 ,\nx21,4 ,\n\uf8fe\n\uf8f3\n2\n2\nx2,4 x3,4 ,\nx23,4\nx2,3 x2,4 , x2,3 x3,4 ,\nx2,4 ,\nx1,4 x3,4 ,\nx2,3 ,\n\n\f16\n\nJ. SIDMAN AND G.G. SMITH\n\n\u0001\nform an ordered basis for \u0393 OX (2) , so the complete linear\nseries of OX (2) embeds X into\n\u0001\n19\nP = Proj(k[y0 , . . . , y19 ]). The matrix \u03a9 OX (1), OX (1) is\n\uf8f9\n\uf8ee\ny0\ny1\ny2 y3\ny4\ny5\n\uf8efy1\ny6\ny7 y8 y5 + y11 y9 \uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8ef\n\uf8efy2\ny7\ny10 y11\ny12\ny13 \uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8ef\n\uf8fa\n\uf8efy3\ny\ny\ny\ny\ny\n8\n11\n14\n15\n16\n\uf8fa\n\uf8ef\n\uf8f0y4 y5 + y11 y12 y15\ny17\ny18 \uf8fb\ny5\ny9\ny13 y16\ny18\ny19\nand the 2-minors of this matrix generated IX|P19 (indeed, this is the second Veronese of the\nPl\u00fccker embedding). Since KX = OX (\u22124) and OX (2) = KX2 \u2297 OX (1)2*4+2 , we see that the\nbound in Theorem 1.3 is sharp in this case.\n\u22c4\nR EFERENCES\n[Ara]\n[Ber]\n[BH]\n[BB]\n[BGL]\n[C-J]\n[CGG]\n[EL]\n[Ei1]\n[Ei2]\n[EKS]\n[Fu1]\n[Fu2]\n[GP]\n[GSS]\n[Gin]\n[Gr1]\n\nD.
