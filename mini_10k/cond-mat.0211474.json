While the electrical transport through\nclean SWNTs has been investigated in different independent experiments, the transport properties of SWNTs\nwith impurities (or in more complicated set-ups) are still\nto be studied in detail. Progress was recently made in\nthis direction: in [2] the manufacture of quantum dots\non the nanotube basis was reported. Surprisingly, the\nauthors found that the transport is dominated by a coherent transmission (or resonant tunnelling) in a wide\nparameter range.\nThe presence of a resonant level is known to enhance\nconductance. Indeed, for non-interacting electrons the\nlocal level hybridises with the conduction band causing\na Lorentzian shaped peak in the density of states (the\nconductance being related to the Breit\u2013Wigner scattering cross-section via the Landauer formula). Unless the\nsystem is exactly at resonance, the picture remains qualitatively the same for the case of interacting electrons,\neven LLs [3]. Therefore one expects the conductance to\nincrease upon lowering the temperature. On the other\nhand, at low temperatures, the conductance is known\nto vanish (unless exactly at resonance) due to the effective enhancement of backscattering processes specific for\nthe LLs. Hence a non-monotonic behaviour of the linear\nconductance as a function of temperature. The limiting\ncases has been thoroughly studied in Refs. [3, 4, 5, 6]\nbut the full description of the cross-over remains an open\nproblem.\nRecently, Nazarov and Glazman (NG) calculated the\ncross-over conductance in the weak electron-electron interaction limit (when the LL parameter g is close to 1)\nby using the Landauer type approach supplemented by\nrenormalisation group [4]. In this paper, we wish to discuss the opposite limit of strong interactions, which is\nrelevant for such systems as SWNTs. We shall concentrate on the special value of the coupling g = 1/2 and\npresent an explicit solution of the problem at this point.\nAt this particular value of the LL parameter and when\n\nthe resonant level energy is tuned to match the equilibrium chemical potentials in the leads, the resonant tunnelling process is marginally relevant and its amplitude\nincreases logarithmically upon lowering the energy scale\n[3, 7]. It turns out that at low temperatures in the linear\nregime (i.e. in the limit of small bias voltage) the sequential tunnelling dominates the transport for g < 1/2,\nwhile above that value the resonant transmission wins\nover [3, 5]. Hence, apart from being supplementary to\nNG results, the exact solution at g = 1/2 yields insights\ninto the interplay between these two transport mechanisms.\nWe model the system by a resonant level (which can\nalso be regarded as a single state quantum dot, so we\nuse both terms) coupled to interacting leads, which is\ndescribed by the following Hamiltonian (we ignore the\nspin degree of freedom throughout the paper),\nH = H K + Ht + HC ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere\nHK is the kinetic part, HK = \u2206d\u2020 d +\nP\ni=R,L H0 [\u03c8i ], describing the the electronic degrees of\nfreedom in the leads H0 [\u03c8i ], and the resonant level with\nenergy \u2206 with the corresponding electron operators being d\u2020 , d. The dot can be populated from either of the\ntwo leads (i = R,\nP L) via electron tunnelling with amplitudes \u03b3i , Ht = i \u03b3i [d\u2020 \u03c8i (0) + h.c.]. Here HC describes\nthe electrostatic Coulomb interaction\nbetween the leads\nP\nand the dot, HC = \u03bbC d\u2020 d i \u03c8i\u2020 (0)\u03c8i (0). This interaction is a new ingredient we have introduced, absent\nin [3] and [4]. It does not, however, affect the universality as we shall show. The contacting electrodes are\nsupposed to be one-dimensional half-infinite electron systems. We model them by chiral fermions living in an\ninfinite system: the negative half-axis then describes the\nparticles moving towards the boundary, while the positive half-axis carries electrons moving away from the end\nof the system. In the bosonic representation H0 [\u03c8i ] are\ndiagonal even in presence of interactions (for a recent review see e.g. [8]; we set the renormalised Fermi velocity\nv = vFR/g = 1, the bare velocity being vF ): H0 [\u03c8i ] =\n(4\u03c0)\u22121 dx [\u2202x \u03c6i (x)]2 . Here the phase fields \u03c6i (x) describe the slow varying spatial component of the electron\n\n\f2\n\nand the tunnelling part (terms containing \u03b3i ) to\nh\n\u221a\n\u221a\nHt\u2032 = (2\u03c0a0 )\u22121/2 S+ (\u03b3L ei\u03c6\u2212 / 2g + \u03b3R e\u2212i\u03c6\u2212 / 2g )\ni\n\u221a\n\u221a\n+ (\u03b3L e\u2212i\u03c6\u2212 / 2g + \u03b3R ei\u03c6\u2212 / 2g )S\u2212 ,\n(2)\n\nwhere S\u00b1 = Sx \u00b1 iSy = d\u2020 , d. At the point g = 1/2 one\ncan re-fermionise the problem by defining new operators\n\u221a\n(3)\n\u03c8\u00b1 = ei\u03c6\u00b1 / 2\u03c0a0 ,\nwhich fulfill standard fermionic commutation relations. With the help of the particle density operator\n\u2020\n\u03c8\u00b1\n\u03c8\u00b1 = \u2202x \u03c6\u00b1 /2\u03c0 we can immediately write down the\nrefermionised Hamiltonian,\n\u2020\nH = H0 [\u03c8\u00b1 ] + (\u03bbC \u2212 2\u03c0)2Sz \u03c8+\n\u03c8+ + \u2206Sz\n\n+ S+ (\u03b3L \u03c8\u2212 +\n\n\u2020\n\u03b3R \u03c8\u2212\n)\n\n+\n\n\u2020\n(\u03b3L \u03c8\u2212\n\n+ \u03b3R \u03c8\u2212 )S\u2212 . (4)\n\nIn the case of the symmetric coupling \u03b3L = \u03b3R this\nHamiltonian is similar to that of the two-channel Kondo\nproblem and, at the Toulouse point \u03bbC = 2\u03c0, can be\nsolved exactly (out of equilibrium) using the method of\nRef.[11]. The novel ingredient in the following analysis is\nthe extension to the asymmetric case. To take advantage\nof the Toulouse point we set the Coulomb coupling amplitude to 2\u03c0 in what follows. This not only removes the\nfour fermion interaction but decouples the '\u00b1' channels\nmaking the '+' channel free (i.e. decoupled from the dot\nvariables).\n\n0\n\u22122\nln(G/G0)\n\n\u221a\ndensity (plasmons), \u03c8i\u2020 (x)\u03c8i (x) = \u2202x \u03c6i (x)/2\u03c0 g. The\nelectron field operator\n\u221a \u221a at the boundary is given by[14],\n\u03c8i (0) = ei\u03c6i (0)/ g / 2\u03c0a0 , where a0 is the lattice constant of the underlying lattice model. Here g is the conventional LL parameter (coupling constant) [3, 8]. In the\nchiral formulation the bias voltage amounts to a difference in the densities of the incoming particles in both\nchannels far away from the constriction [9]. The current\nis then proportional to the difference betwee the densities\nof incoming and outgoing particles within each channel.\nTo the best of our knowledge, Hamiltonian (1) cannot be solved exactly even in the g = 1 case as long as\n\u03bbC remains finite. However, after a transformation of d\u2020\nand d operators to the spin representation of the form\nSx = (d\u2020 + d)/2, Sy = \u2212i(d\u2020 \u2212 d)/2, Sz = d\u2020 d \u2212 1/2,\none immediately observes that the \u03bbC term is analogous\nto the Sz \u2013spin density coupling in the Kondo problem.\nThe latter is known to be explicitly solvable at a particular value of the longitudinal coupling: the Toulouse limit\n(see e.g. [8]). Let us perform a similar calculation. As a\nfirst step we introduce new\n\u221a symmetric and antisymmetric\nfields \u03c6\u00b1 = (\u03c6L \u00b1 \u03c6R )/ 2, which still fulfill the bosonic\ncommutation relations. Then we apply\u221athe transformation H \u2032 = U \u2020 HU with U = exp(iSz \u03c6+ / 2g) [10], which\nchanges the kinetic and the Coulomb coupling parts of\nthe full Hamiltonian to (we drop a constant contribution)\np\np\n\u2032\nHK\n+ HC\u2032 = HK + (\u03bbC /\u03c0 2g \u2212 2/g)Sz \u2202x \u03c6+ (0) ,\n\n\u22124\n\n\u03b1=0.2\n\u03b1=0.3\n\u03b1=0.4\n\u03b1=0.45\n\u03b1=0.5\n\n\u22126\n\u22128\n\u221210\n\n\u22126\n\n\u22124\n\n\u22122\n0\nln(T/\u0393)\n\n2\n\n4\n\nFIG. 1: Linear differential conductance at the resonance\n\u2206 = 0 as a function of temperature for different values of\nthe asymmetry parameter \u03b1.\n\nAs we already mentioned, due to the linear dispersion relation, the current through the system is proportional to the difference between the densities of particles\nmoving towards the dot and away from it in either of\nthe channels. Due to the chiral geometry we then have\n\u2020\n\u2020\nI \u223c \u03c8L\n\u03c8L (\u2212\u221e) \u2212 \u03c8L\n\u03c8L (\u221e) , which, being transformed\n\u2020\n\u2020\nto '\u00b1' channels, results in I \u223c \u03c8\u2212\n\u03c8\u2212 (\u2212\u221e) \u2212 \u03c8\u2212\n\u03c8\u2212 (\u221e).\nSince the '+' channel is free, it doesn't contribute to the\nabove formula. As the '\u2212' channel is also free when away\nfrom the dot, in order to calculate the current we only\nneed to know the scattering matrix of '\u2212' fermions determined by Hamiltonian (4). The chemical potential of\nthe incoming particles is determined by the bias voltage.\nHence, the current is given by (we measure voltage in\nenergy units, i.e. set e = 1)\nZ\nI(V ) = G0\nd\u03c9 T (\u03c9)[nF (\u03c9 \u2212 V ) \u2212 nF (\u03c9)]\n(5)\nwhere nF denotes the Fermi distribution function and\nD(\u03c9) = 1 \u2212 T (\u03c9) is the energy dependent penetration\ncoefficient of the '\u2212' particles from x < 0 to x > 0. The\npre-factor G0 = e2 /h is fixed by the requirement that at\nzero transmission D(\u03c9) = 0 (or perfect transmission of\nthe whole structure) one obtains the correct conductance.\nThe easiest way to obtain the transmission coefficient\nis the equations of motion method. Since we have two\ntypes of operators: for the electrons of the '\u2212' channel\nand for the resonance level (we go back to the original\nd\u2020 , d operators), we need two equations of motion,\ni\u2202t \u03c8\u2212 (x) = \u2212i\u2202x \u03c8\u2212 (x) + \u03b4(x)(\u03b3L d \u2212 \u03b3R d\u2020 ) ,\n\u2020\ni\u2202t d = \u2206d + \u03b3L \u03c8\u2212 (0) + \u03b3R \u03c8\u2212\n(0) .\n\n(6)\n\nIntegrating the first one around x = 0 we obtain\ni[\u03c8\u2212 (0+ ) \u2212 \u03c8\u2212 (0\u2212 )] = \u03b3L d \u2212 \u03b3R d\u2020 .\n\n(7)\n\nActing with \u2202t2 + \u22062 on both sides of this relation yields\n(\u2202t2 + \u22062 )[\u03c8\u2212 (0+ ) \u2212 \u03c8\u2212 (0\u2212 )]\n\n(8)\n\n\f3\n\u2020\n2\n2\n= \u2212[(\u03b3L2 + \u03b3R\n)\u2202t + i\u2206(\u03b3R\n\u2212 \u03b3L2 )]\u03c8\u2212 (0) \u2212 2\u03b3R \u03b3L \u2202t \u03c8\u2212\n(0) .\n\nBecause the dispersion relation is linear, \u03c9 = vk = k,\nwe can use \u03c9 as the momentum variable as well as the\nenergy variable. Inserting Eq.(9) into Eq.(8) and using\n\u03c8\u2212 (0) = [\u03c8\u2212 (0+ ) + \u03c8\u2212 (0\u2212 )]/2 results in\nE(b\u03c9 \u2212 a\u03c9 ) = \u2212i\u03b2+ (a\u03c9 + b\u03c9 ) + i\u03b3(a\u2020\u2212\u03c9 + b\u2020\u2212\u03c9 ) , (10)\nwhere we introduced the following objects:\nE = \u22062 \u2212 \u03c9 2 ,\np\n\u03b2\u00b1 = [(1 \u2212 2\u03b1)\u2206 \u00b1 \u03c9]/2, \u03b3 = \u03c9 \u03b1(1 \u2212 \u03b1), and \u03b1 =\n2\n\u03b3L2 /(\u03b3L2 + \u03b3R\n) (the asymmetry parameter). From now on\n\u03c9, \u2206, the bias voltage V , and the temperature T are all\n2\nmeasured in units of \u0393 = \u03b3L2 + \u03b3R\n. Considering in addition to Eq.(10) its complex conjugate for \u2212\u03c9 we establish\na relation between the amplitudes of the incoming (a\u03c9 )\nand transmitted (b\u03c9 ) particle fluxes. The transmission\ncoefficient can then be read off as follows:\nT (\u03c9)\n\n(11)\n2\n\n=\n\n2\n\n4\u03b3 E\n2 )(E 2 + \u03b2 2 ) + 2\u03b3 2 (E 2 + \u03b2 \u03b2 ) + \u03b3 4 ,\n(E 2 + \u03b2+\n\u2212 +\n\u2212\n\nThis equation, accompanied by Eq.(5), provides all informations about the transport properties of the system and is the central result of this paper. The experimentally relevant quantity is the differential conductance\nG = dI/dV . At zero temperature, Eq.(5) considerably\nsimplifies and, differentiating with respect to the bias\nvoltage, one immediately finds that G/G0 = T (V ). In\nthe case when the couplings between the dot and the\nleads are perfectly symmetric and one of the chemical\npotentials matches \u2206, G reaches the maximal value of\nG0 . This is a typical signature of the resonant tunnelling\neffect usually encountered in transport phenomena in\ndouble-barrier structures [12]. In fact, our system is a\nmodel for such a structure with one single state between\nthe barriers.\nThe interplay between the LL's enhancement of the\nbackscattering at low temperatures (resulting in decreasing conductance) and the more standard Breit-Wigner\nphysics emerging in the resonant tunnelling can be seen\nin Fig.1. As predicted in Refs.[3, 4], in the symmetric\ncase \u03b1 = 0.5 and for \u2206 = 0, the conductance saturates\nat low temperatures to its maximal value. In the presence\nof an asymmetry G does not saturate any more and vanishes as a power\u2013law towards T = 0 with the exponent 2.\nThis value is equal to twice the density of states exponent\n\u03bd of the LL with an open boundary: \u03bd = 1/g\u22121 [8], which\nin our case is equal to 1. This fact indicates that in this\nregime the electrons are transferred through the system\nin a single stage process [4], so that the internal structure of the dot does not matter any more. Contrary to\n\n2.5\n\nln(w/\u0393)\n\nNow we can insert into this relation the momentum decomposition of the field operator \u03c8\u2212\n\u001a\nZ\ndk ik(t\u2212x) ak for x < 0\ne\n.\n(9)\n\u03c8\u2212 (x, t) =\nbk for x > 0\n2\u03c0\n\n\u03b1=0.2\n\u03b1=0.3\n\u03b1=0.4\n\u03b1=0.5\n\n0.5\n\n\u22121.5\n\n\u22123.5\n\n\u22127\n\n\u22125\n\n\u22123\nln(T/\u0393)\n\n\u22121\n\n1\n\nFIG. 2: The width of the resonant conductance peak as a\nfunction of temperature for different values of the asymmetry\nparameter \u03b1.\n\nEq.(9) of NG, the high temperature (T \u226b 1) evolution\nof the conductance follows the law G/G0 \u223c 1/T . The\nreason is that the problem maps onto a free-fermion one,\nfor which the 1/T behaviour is inevitable. Note that,\nin the language of the original model, this corresponds\nto tunnelling of composite objects from one LL into the\nother.\nAnother interesting issue is the shape of the resonance\npeak, especially its width, w(T ), as a function of temperature, see Fig.2. At high temperatures it decreases\nlinearly upon lowering T no matter how strong are the\ninteractions. For T \u226a 1, however, the correlation effects\nbecome visible and the width w(T ) of the peak saturates\nat zero temperature unless the dot is symmetric. In the\nlatter case w(T ) shrinks to zero with the exponent 1 \u2212 g\npredicted in Ref.[3]: w(T ) \u223c T 0.5 .\nIt is in fact not difficult to evaluate the integral in\nEq.(5) analytically. The general expression is complicated, so we shall only present here some particular cases.\nTo begin with we observe that there is an intimate relation between our model at \u2206 = 0, \u03b1 = 1/2 (resonant\nand symmetric case) and the g = 1/2 solution for the\nconductance through a single barrier (Gs ) given in [3].\nIndeed, evaluating (11) for the case in question, we find\n(in linear response)\nG\u2206=0 (T )/G0 =\n\n1 \u2032\n\u03c8\n2\u03c0T\n\n\u0012\n\n1\n1\n+\n2 2\u03c0T\n\n\u0013\n\n(12)\n\nwhere \u03c8 is the \u03c8-function. Comparing with Ref.[13] (see\nalso [8]), we observe that G\u2206=0 (T )/G0 = 1 \u2212 Gs (T )/G0\nif T in Gs is measured in units of the backscattering\nstrength. One can easily show that an analogous relation\ncontinue to hold for the out\u2013of\u2013equilibrium current.\nFurthermore, for the linear conductance when \u03b1 = 1/2\nbut \u2206 6= 0 (|\u2206| < 1/2) we obtain\nG\u2206 (T )/G0 =\n\n1\n2\u03c0T (\u03bb2+ \u2212 \u03bb2\u2212 )\n\n\u0014\n\n\u03bb+ \u03c8 \u2032\n\n\u0012\n\n1\n\u03bb+\n+\n2 2\u03c0T\n\n\u0013\n\n\f4\nstrength (resonance off-set). Indeed, taking the appropriate limit in formula (13), we obtain the exact scaling\nfunction at g = 1/2: G\u2206 (T )/G0 = G\u0303g=1/2 (X), where\n\nln(G/G0)\n\n0\n\nG\u03031/2 (X) = 1 \u2212\n\u221210\n4\n\nln [(w/\u2206) ]\nln (G/G0)\n\u221220\n\n\u22127\n\n\u22125\n\n\u22123\n\u22121\nln(T/\u0393)\n\n1\n\nFIG. 3: Comparison between the linear conductance (dashed\nlines) and the approximative scaling function (w/\u2206)4 (solid\nlines) for different values of \u2206: from above \u2206 = 0.5, 1, 2, 4.\n\n\u2212 \u03bb\u2212 \u03c8 \u2032\n\n\u0012\n\n1\n\u03bb\u2212\n+\n2 2\u03c0T\n\n\u0013\u0015\n\n,\n\n(13)\n\np\n\u221a\n\u221a\nwhere 2\u03bb\u00b1 = 1 \u2212 2\u22062 \u00b1 1 \u2212 4\u22062 . Same formula\nis valid in the resonant but asymmetric\np case (\u2206 = 0,\n\u03b1 6= 1/2) if we substitute \u03bb\u00b1 \u2192 1/2 \u00b1 \u03b1(1 \u2212 \u03b1). This\nshows that the asymmetry parameter is equivalent to a\nsmall off-set of the resonance (if the two act independently). (Indeed, in terms of the Kondo analogy, the\nchannel asymmetry is known to be relevant.) For a strong\noff-set of the resonance (|\u2206| > 1/2), formula (13) is not\nvalid and should be replaced by:\n\u0013\u0015\n\u0012\n\u0014\n1 \u2206ei\u03b8\n\u2206\ni\u03b8 \u2032\n\u221a\n+\nIm e \u03c8\nG\u2206 (T )/G0 =\n2\n2\u03c0T\n\u03c0T 4\u22062 \u2212 1\n(14)\n\u221a\nwhere \u03b8 = tan\u22121 [ 4\u22062 \u2212 1/(1 \u2212 2\u22062 )]/2.\nAs pointed out in Ref.[3], for \u2206, T \u226a 1, the conductance should become a universal (scaling) function of\nthe ratio of the resonance width and the backscattering\n\n[1] C.

We note that our scaling function G\u0303g=1/2 (X) is by far more complicated than\nG\u0303g\u22431 (X) = 1/(1 + X 2 ) found by NG in weak coupling.\nFurthermore we observe from our analytic expressions\nthat beyond \u2206, T \u226a 1 there is no exact scaling. However, upon determining w(T ) numerically and plotting\n[w(T )/\u2206]4 versus the dimensionless conductance G/G0 ,\nwe obtain an approximate numerical scaling as shown in\nFig.3. The same scaling function (15) holds in the resonant (\u2206 = 0) but weakly asymmetric case, when \u03b1 \u2212 1/2\nis small. In that situation \u03b1 \u2212 1/2 substitutes \u2206 in the\ndefinition of X.\nTo summarise, we presented an explicit solution for\nthe transport through a resonant level coupled to two\nLL leads. It turns out that for g = 1/2 the Hamiltonian\nof the system can be mapped onto one similar to the\ntwo-channel Kondo Hamiltonian in the Toulouse limit,\nsolvable exactly. We obtained the full I \u2212 V characteristics, which shows all the effects inherent to resonant\ntunnelling setups in LLs, including the scaling. Our solution confirms previous results obtained by means of the\nperturbation theory and goes beyond them. In future, it\nwould be interesting to study deviations from g = 1/2\n(in the spirit of Ref.[13]) and to investigate the effects of\nelectron spin (and flavour).\nThe authors would like to thank H.
