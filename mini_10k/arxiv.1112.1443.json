(See also [2] for a survey of related\nresults, [3, 4] for connections to the quantization of (1 + 1)-dimensional Yang\u2013\nMills theory, and [5] for connections to geometric quantization.) The transform\n\n1\n\n\fconsists of integrating the position wavefunction against certain coherent states,\nwhich are expressed in terms of the heat kernel on the group. In Section 11 of [1],\nthis transform is extended to compact symmetric spaces, such as the d-sphere\nS d . M. Stenzel [6] has given a particularly nice description of the transform for\nsymmetric spaces, a description that brings out the role of the heat kernel for\nthe dual noncompact symmetric space. The unitarity of the Segal\u2013Bargmann\ntransform can be expressed, in typical physics terminology, as a resolution of\nthe identity for the associated coherent states. Work has also been done on\nnoncompact symmetric spaces [7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12], but the situation there is\nmuch more complicated. (See also [13] for a Segal\u2013Bargmann transform for the\nHeisenberg group.)\nIn a previous paper [14], we considered coherent states for a particle moving\nin a d-dimensional sphere. This means that we regard S d as the configuration\nspace of our system, with the associated phase space then being the cotangent\nbundle T \u2217 S d , which may be identified with the tangent bundle T S d. (It is\npossible to regard the 2-sphere S 2 as the phase space of a classical system, but\nthat is a completely different problem.) Although the results about coherent\nstates on S d are in principle special cases of results of Hall and Stenzel, we\ngave a self-contained and substantially different treatment of the subject. In\nparticular, we brought in the \"complexifier\" method of T. Thiemann [15] and\nthe \"polar decomposition\" method of Kowalski and Rembieli\u0144ski [16]. (The\ncoherent states in [16] were constructed independently, without any knowledge\nof the work of Hall or Stenzel.) We gave an elementary proof of the resolution\nof the identity for the coherent states on S d (compare [17] in the 2-dimensional\ncase), showing very concretely how the heat equation on the dual noncompact\nsymmetric space, namely d-dimensional hyperbolic space, arises. We have also\nshown [18] that when d is odd, the coherent states we construct converge to the\nusual Gaussian coherent states on Rd in the limit as the radius of the sphere\ntends to infinity. (The same result is expected to hold in the even-dimensional\ncase.) In the case of S 3 = SU(2), many detailed properties of the coherent states\nwere worked out in [19], with applications to quantum gravity.\nIn the present paper, we consider a charged particle moving in S 2 in the\npresence of a magnetic field of constant magnitude B, pointing in the direction\nperpendicular to the sphere. (If we think of our particle as a 3-dimensional\nparticle that is constrained to move on S 2 , then the magnetic field may be\nthought of as coming from a magnetic monopole at the origin.) Since, as we\nwill see, the quantum Hilbert space for such a particle is not the same as in the\nnonmagnetic case, the coherent states will necessarily have to be modified.\nIn Section 3, we use the \"complexifier\" method of T. Thiemann to construct\na diffeomorphism a between the phase space T S 2 and the complex sphere\n\b\nSC2 = a \u2208 C3 a21 + a22 + a23 = r2 .\nWhen the magnetic field strength B is set equal to zero, this diffeomorphism\nreduces to the one considered in [14]. In Section 4, we then use the quantum\nversion of the complexifier method to construct annihilation operators Ak satisfying A21 + A22 + A23 = r2 . In Section 5, we construct our coherent states as\n2\n\n\fsimultaneous eigenvectors for the Ak 's. In the position representation, the coherent states can be expressed in terms of the heat kernel for a certain line\nbundle over S 2 .\nWe then turn, in Section 6, to the construction of a (Segal\u2013)Bargmann representation for the quantum Hilbert space,which is equivalent to a resolution of\nthe identity. The density used in the definition of the Segal\u2013Bargmann space\nis again a sort of bundle heat kernel, which may be constructed by the method\nof \"reduction to the group case.\" Once the Segal\u2013Bargmann space has been\nconstructed, we describe a unitary Segal\u2013Bargmann transform between the position Hilbert space and the Segal\u2013Bargmann space. This transform consists of\napplying the bundle heat operator to a section over the real sphere S 2 and then\nanalytically continuing to the complex sphere SC2 .\nWhen the magnetic field is zero, the complex structure we get on T S 2 by\nidentifying it with SC2 coincides with the \"adapted complex structure\" on T S 2 ,\nas introduced independently by Lempert\u2013 Sz\u0151ke [20, 21] and Guillemin\u2013Stenzel\n[22, 23]. Meanwhile, in [24], the construction of the adapted complex structure\nis interpreted in terms of the \"imaginary-time geodesic flow,\" following the\ncomplexifier approach of Thiemann. (\"Time\" here should not be understood as\nphysical time but simply as the parameter in a flow.) More recently, Hall and\nKirwin have introduced a \"magnetic\" version of adapted complex structure [25].\nIn the case of a constant magnetic field on S 2 , the complex structure on T S 2\ngiven by the method of [25] (see Section 5 of [25]) coincides with the complex\nstructure obtained by identifying T S 2 with SC2 by means of the diffeormorphism\na.\nFinally, we note that if we apply the complexifier method for a particle moving in the plane in a constant magnetic field, we will obtain coherent states that\nare expressible in terms of the heat kernel (i.e., imaginary-time propogator) for\nthe quantum Hamiltonian. Such coherent states do not agree with the coherent\nstates introduced by I. Malkin and V. Man'ko in [26], nor do they agree with\nthe coherent states introduced in by K. Kowalski and J. Rembieli\u0144ski in [27]. In\nparticular, the \"complexifier\" coherent states will not be stable under the time\nevolution of the system. On the other hand, the complexifier coherent states\nwill pass over smoothly to the usual minimum-uncertainty Gaussian coherent\nstates as the magnetic field strength tends to zero, something that seemingly\ncannot be true for any coherent states that are temporally stable. After all,\nwhen the magnetic field strength is zero, one should not expect temporally stable coherent states, because of the phenomenon of the spreading of the wave\npacket. The complexifier coherent states on the plane do have an associated\nSegal\u2013Bargmann representation, which is described in Section 4 of [13], with\nthe parameter \u03bb in [13] is to be identified with the magnetic field strength. (See\nSection 4 of [25] for an explicit connection between Section 4 of [13] and the\ncomplexifier method.)\n\n3\n\n\f2\n\nThe classical mechanics of a particle in a magnetic field\n\n2.1\n\nThe Rn case\n\nWe wish to give a Hamiltonian description of the motion of a charged particle in\nRn in the presence of a time-independent magnetic field, described by a skewsymmetric matrix Bjk . Since we are dealing with a single charged particle, we\ncan incorporate the charge of the particle into the definition of the magnetic\nfield. The condition \u2207 * B = 0 in R3 becomes the condition that the 2-form\n(1/2)Bjk (x)dxj \u2227 dxk should be closed, or, equivalently, that\n\u2202Bjk\n\u2202Bkl\n\u2202Blj\n+\n+\n=0\n\u2202xl\n\u2202xj\n\u2202xk\nfor all j, k, l. It is desirable to formulate the theory in Rn in a way that makes\nno reference to the vector potential, since in the sphere case there will be no\nglobally defined vector potential. We consider, then, position variables xj and\n\"kinetic\" momentum variables pj along with a Poisson bracket defined by\n{f, g}B =\n\n\u2202f \u2202g\n\u2202f \u2202g\n\u2202f \u2202g\n\u2212\n+ Bjk (x)\n\u2202xj \u2202pj\n\u2202pj \u2202xj\n\u2202pj \u2202pk\n\n(1)\n\n(sum convention). In particular, the relations among our position and momentum variables are\n{xj , xk } = 0\n{xj , pk } = \u03b4jk\n{pj , pk } = Bjk (x).\n\n(2)\n\nWe then introduce a Hamiltonian H by\nH(x, p) =\n\np2\n.\n2m\n\n(3)\n\nThe equations of motion are computed by using the general formula df /dt =\n{f, H}. Specializing to f = xj and to f = pj gives\npj\ndxj\n=\ndt\nm\ndpj\n1\n= Bjk (x)pk .\ndt\nm\n\n(4)\n\nNote that pj = m dxj /dt; this relation accounts for the terminology \"kinetic\nmomentum.\" Note also that in this approach, the magnetic field enters only\ninto the Poisson-bracket relations (2) and not into the Hamiltonian (3). In\nthe case n = 3, the skew matrix Bjk can be encoded by a vector B, in which\ncase the formula for the derivative of momentum becomes dp/dt = (p/m) \u00d7 B.\n4\n\n\f(Recall that we are absorbing the charge of the particle into the definition of\nthe magnetic field.)\nAlthough the approach we have just described is the best one for generalizing to manifolds, in the Rn case, we may alternatively consider \"canonical\" momentum variables p\u0303j satisfying the usual Poisson bracket relations, that\nis, {xj, p\u0303k } = \u03b4jk and all other brackets are zero. The Hamiltonian is then\n(p\u0303 \u2212 A)2 /(2m), where A is the vector potential for B. The two types of momentum variables are related by pj = p\u0303j \u2212 Aj .\n\n2.2\n\nThe manifold case\n\nLet M be a Riemannian manifold with metric g, thought of as the configuration\nspace for our system. The phase space is then the cotangent bundle T \u2217 M. On\nT \u2217 M we have the canonical 1-form \u03b8, which is given in local coordinates as\n\u03b8 = pj dxj , along with the canonical 2-form \u03c9 := \u2212d\u03b8, given in coordinates as\n\u03c9 = dxj \u2227 dpj . We assume M is equipped with a \"magnetic field,\" which we\nmodel as a closed 2-form B. If \u03c0 : T \u2217 M \u2192 M is the projection onto the base,\nthen the pulled-back form \u03c0 \u2217 (B) is a closed 2-form on T \u2217 M. In local coordinates,\nwe have B = (1/2)Bjk (x)dxj \u2227 dxk for a unique skew-symmetric matrix Bjk , in\nwhich case \u03c0 \u2217 (B) is given by the same formula, but with the xj 's now viewed\nas functions on T \u2217 M.\nWe now consider the modified symplectic form \u03c9 B given by \u03c9 B = \u03c9 \u2212\u03c0 \u2217 (B).\nIn the usual sort of cotangent bundle coordinates {xj , pj }, we may represent \u03c9 B\nby the matrix\n\u0012\n\u0013\nB I\nB\n\u03c9 =\n.\n\u2212I 0\n\nThen the Poisson bracket of any two functions f and g is defined by {f, g} =\n\u2212(\u03c9 B )\u22121 (df, dg). It is easily verified that the formula for {f, g} in coordinates\nis the same as in (1). In particular, the momentum variables do not in general\nPoisson commute, but rather satisfy {pj , pk }B = Bjk (x). Thus, the pj 's should\nbe thought of as the kinetic momenta.\nWe introduce the Hamiltonian\n1\nH(x, p) =\ngjk (x)pj pk .\n2m\nThe dynamics associated to the Hamiltonian H and the symplectic form \u03c9 B are\nthe dynamics of a charged particle moving on M acted on by the magnetic field\nB (but no other forces). The equations of motion in coordinates are\ngjk (x)\ndxj\n= {xj , H} =\npk\ndt\nm\nand\n\ndpj\ngkl (x)\n1 \u2202gkl\npk pl + Bjk (x)\n= {pj , H} = \u2212\npl .\ndt\n2m \u2202xj\nm\n\nThe expression for dxj /dt in terms of pk is the same as for a free particle\nmoving on M, which justifies calling the pj 's the kinetic momenta. Meanwhile,\n5\n\n\fthe expression for dpj /dt differs from a free particle by the addition of the term\ninvolving B. As in the Rn case, none of the relevant formulas requires us to\nchoose a vector potential for B.\n\n3\n\nComplex coordinates on phase space\n\nWe now specialize to the case in which our configuration space is the 2-sphere\nS 2 , consisting of points x \u2208 R3 such that x2 = r2 , for some positive constant r.\nOn S 2 , we consider a magnetic field equal to a constant B times the area form:\n1\nxl\nB\u03b5jkl\ndxj \u2227 dxk .\n2\nr\n\n(5)\n\nOur goal in this section is to introduce on T \u2217 S 2 certain complex valued functions\naj , j = 1, 2, 3, that will allow us to identify T \u2217 S 2 with the complex sphere\n\b\nSC2 = a \u2208 C3 |a21 + a22 + a23 = 1 .\n\nThen, in the next section, we will quantize the functions aj to obtain operators\nAj , which we think of as annihilation operators. Our coherent states will then\nbe simultaneous eigenvectors for the annihilation operators.\n\n3.1\n\nAngular momentum\n\nWe permanently identify the cotangent bundle T \u2217 S 2 with the tangent bundle\nT S 2 , using the metric on S 2 . Thus, we consider\n\b\nT S 2 = (x, p) x2 = r2 , x * p = 0 .\n\nThe canonical 2-form \u03c9 is then given by\n\n\u03c9(x,p) ((a, b), (c, d)) = a * d \u2212 b * c\nfor all (a, b) and (c, d) in T(x,p) (T S 2 ). We then subtract from \u03c9 the pull-back\n\u03c0 \u2217 (B) of the \"magnetic\" 2-form B in (5) under the projection map \u03c0, where\n\u03c0((x, p)) = x. The resulting form \u03c9 B := \u03c9 \u2212 \u03c0 \u2217 (B) is closed and nondegenerate.\nThe vector p is to be thought of as the kinetic momentum of the system and\nnot the canonical momentum.\nIt is convenient to calculate in terms of appropriately defined angular momentum functions. Since B is invariant under rotations, \u03c9 B is invariant under\nsimultaneous rotations of x and p. Let E1 be the vector field denoting representing an infinitesimal rotation around the e1 -axis, in both x and p, so that\nE1 = x2\n\n\u2202\n\u2202\n\u2202\n\u2202\n\u2212 x3\n+ p2\n\u2212 p3\n.\n\u2202x3\n\u2202x2\n\u2202p3\n\u2202p2\n\nWe then define E2 and E3 by cyclic permutation of the indices in the definition\nof E1 . We then look for angular momentum functions J1 , J2 , J3 such that\n\u03c9 B (Ej , *) = dJj .\n6\n\n\fThese functions will have the property that {Jj , f } = Ej f, for j = 1, 2, 3.\nSince \u03c9 B is a sum of terms, one of which depends only on the position\nvariables, we may look for Jj of the same form. It is straightforward to check\nthat\nJ(x, p) = x \u00d7 p \u2212 rBx.\n(6)\nThe Poisson bracket relations involving J and x are:\n{xj , xk } = 0\n{Jj , xk } = \u03b5jkl xl\n{Jj , Jl } = \u03b5jkl Jl .\n\n(7)\n\nThe first of these relations is true in general for magnetic symplectic forms (compare (1)) and the second and third relations hold because {Jj , f } is an infinitesimal rotation of f. Although one can work out the Poisson bracket relations\ninvolving the linear momentum by expressing p in terms of J as p = J \u00d7 x/r2 ,\nwe will not have need for these relations in the present article.\nAlthough the relations (7) are identical to what we have in the B = 0 case,\nwe should keep in mind that the J function is not the usual one. The \"magnetic\"\nJ is distinguished from the ordinary one by the algebraic relation\nJ * x = \u2212r3 B.\n\n(8)\n\nJ 2 = r 2 p2 + r 4 B 2 .\n\n(9)\n\nNote also that\nThe angular momentum is a constant of motion for the dynamics associated to\nthe symplectic form \u03c9 B and the Hamiltonian H = p2 /(2m). Thus, the particle's\nposition x will always lie in the circle obtained by intersecting S 2 with the plane\nJ*x = \u2212r3 B, where J is the value of the angular momentum vector at the initial\ntime.\n\n3.2\n\nThe classical complexifier method\n\nWe now apply Thiemann's complexifier method (Section 2 of [15]), as we did in\n[14] in the nonmagnetic case. To do this, we take a constant \u03b1 (denoted \u03c9 in\n[14]) with units of frequency, and we define our complexifier function by\ncomplexifier =\n\nenergy\np2\nJ2\n+ const.\n=\n=\n\u03b1\n2m\u03b1\n2m\u03b1r2\n\nSince, as will be apparent shortly, adding a constant to the complexifier has no\neffect on the calculations, we will ignore the constant in the expression for the\ncomplexifier in terms of J 2 . Then, as in [14], we define complex-valued functions\naj on T S 2 by the formula\naj = e\n\ni{*,complexifier}\n\n(xj ) =\n\n\u221e \u0012\nX\n\nn=0\n\ni\n2m\u03b1r2\n\n7\n\n\u0013n\n\n1\n{* * * {{xj , J 2 }, J 2 }, * * * , J 2 }.\nn! |\n{z\n}\nn\n\n\f(Note that replacing J 2 by J 2 plus a constant has no effect on the value of\naj .) The \"i\" in the exponent in the formula for aj should not be understood as\nphysical time, but merely as a parameter in our construction. That is to say,\nwe are still going to consider quantum mechanics using ordinary (real) time.\nUsing (7) and the product rule, we calculate {xj , J 2 } to be 2\u03b5jkl Jk xl . Thus,\nin vector notation,\n\u001a\n\u001b\nJ2\n1\nx,\n=\nJ \u00d7 x.\n2m\u03b1r2\nm\u03b1r2\nSince each Jj Poisson-commutes with J 2 , as is easily verified, we may treat J\nas a constant in computing subsequent commutators. Thus,\n\u0013n\n\u001b\n\u001a\n\u221e \u0012\nX\ni\n1\ni\nJ\n\u00d7\n*\n(x)\n=\nJ \u00d7 (* * * J \u00d7 (J \u00d7 x))). (10)\na = exp\n2\nm\u03b1r2\nm\u03b1r\nn!\nn=0\n\nAgain, the dependence of (10) on the magnetic field strength B is through the\ndependence of J on B.\nTheorem 1 We have\na(x, p) = (cosh L)x + i\n\n(cosh L \u2212 1) J(x, p)\nsinh L p\nB 2 2\n\u2212\nL m\u03b1\nL2\nm \u03b1 r\n\nwhere J(x, p) is given by (6) and where L is a dimensionless version of the total\nangular momentum given by\np\np2 + r 2 B 2\n|J(x, p)|\nL=\n=\n.\n2\nm\u03b1r\nm\u03b1r\nWhen B = 0, the J terms drops out, L becomes equal to p/(m\u03b1r), and we\nobtain the expression for a(x, p) in Equation 18 of [14] (with \u03b1 being identified\nwith \u03c9 in [14]). We should mention that the B = 0 formula was already well\nknown prior to [14], for example on p. 410 of [21].\nProof. A simple computation shows that\nJ \u00d7 x = r2 p\nJ \u00d7 p= \u2212\n\nJ2\nx \u2212 rBJ.\nr2\n\nSince also J \u00d7 J = 0, the action of \"cross product with J\" on the vectors x, p,\nand J may be represented by the matrix\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n2\n0 \u2212 Jr2 0\nJ \u00d7 * = \uf8ed r2\n(11)\n0\n0 \uf8f8.\n0 \u2212rB 0\n\nBy (10), if we exponentiate i/(m\u03b1r2 ) times the matrix in (11), the first column of\nthe resulting matrix will tell us the coefficients of a(x, p) in terms of the vectors\nx, p, and J. The exponentiation can be done by hand or using a computer\nalgebra program, with the result being the formula in the theorem.\n8\n\n\fTheorem 2 Let SC2 denote the set\n\b\nSC2 = a \u2208 C3 a21 + a22 + a23 = r2 .\n\nThen the map (x, p) 7\u2192 a(x, p) is diffeomorphism of T S 2 onto SC2 . Furthermore,\nwe have\n{aj , ak } = 0\n\nfor all j and k.\nNote that there are no absolute values in the definition of SC2 , which is\na 2-dimensional complex submanifold of C3 . If C = J 2 /(2m\u03b1r2 ) denotes the\ncomplexifier, then {*, C} is a derivation, meaning that {f g, C} = {f, C}g +\nf {g, C}. As a result, the exponential of i{*, C} is multiplicative, by the usual\npower series argument for exponentials. Thus,\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\nX\nX\n(ei{*,C} xj )2 = ei{*,C} \uf8ed\nx2j \uf8f8 = ei{*,C} (r2 ) = r2 .\na2 =\nj\n\nj\n\nThis shows that a(x, p) is contained in SC2 for all x and p. That a is a diffeomorphism of T S 2 onto SC2 is shown in Section 5 of [25]. Meanwhile, {*, C} is\nalso a derivation with respect to the Poisson bracket, so that the exponential of\ni{*, C} preserves brackets. Thus, since xj and xk Poisson commute, aj and ak\nalso Poisson commute.\n\n4\n4.1\n\nThe annihilation operators\nRepresentations of the Euclidean group\n\nWe assume that the quantum Hilbert space carries an irreducible unitary representation of the unique simply connected Lie group G whose Lie algebra is\ndefined by the commutation relations in (7). This Lie algebra is easily identified\nas the Lie algebra e(3) of the Euclidean group E(3) = SO(3) \u22c9 R3 . To find the\nuniversal cover of E(3), we first note that the universal cover of SO(3) is SU(2),\nwhere the covering map \u039e of SU(2) onto SO(3) is two-to-one and onto. For\ndefiniteness, let us choose \u039e : SU(2) \u2192 SO(3) so that\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n\u0012 i\u03b8/2\n\u0013\ncos \u03b8 \u2212 sin \u03b8 0\ne\n0\ncos \u03b8 0 \uf8f8 .\n\u039e\n= \uf8ed sin \u03b8\n(12)\n0\ne\u2212i\u03b8/2\n0\n0 1\nThe universal cover \u1ebc(3) of E(3) is then given by\n\u1ebc(3) = SU(2) \u22c9 R3 .\nHere, SU(2) acts on R3 by first mapping to SO(3) by the two-to-one covering\nmap and then acting on R3 by rotations.\n9\n\n\fThe irreducible representations of \u1ebc(3) are classified by the Wigner\u2013Mackey\nmethod. (See, for example, [28].) To apply this method, we first choose an\norbit of SU(2) inside R3 , which is a sphere of some radius r that we assume is\npositive. (We identify this radius with the radius of the sphere whose cotangent\nbundle we are quantizing.) We then choose a point in S 2 , which we take to be\nthe north pole n = (0, 0, r). The little group is then the subgroup of SU(2) that\nmaps n to n. From (12), we can see that the little group is just the diagonal\nsubgroup D of SU(2). The choice of an irreducible representation of the little\ngroup then completes the specification of an irreducible representation of \u1ebc(3).\nEvery irreducible representation of D is one dimensional and of the form\n\u0012 i\u03b8/2\n\u0013\ne\n0\n7\u2192 eil\u03b8 ,\n0\ne\u2212i\u03b8/2\nfor some integer or half-integer l. In the notation of K. Kowalski and J. Rembieli\u0144ski [16], the parameter l is the \"twist\" of the system; it is analogous to the\nspin of a particle moving in R3 .\nWe will use the standard basis {E1 , E2 , E3 } of su(2), given by\n\u0012\n\u0012\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0013\n\u0013\n1\n1\n1\n0 1\n0 i\ni\n0\nE1 =\n; E2 =\n; E3 =\n.\n(13)\n\u22121 0\ni 0\n0 \u2212i\n2\n2\n2\nThese matrices satisfy [Ej , Ek ] = \u03b5jkl El . Let \u03a3r,l denote the representation of\n\u1ebc(3) corresponding to a choice of r, l. Then the associated Lie algebra representation is described by \"position\" operators X1 , X2 , X3 , whose joint spectrum is\nS 2 , along with \"angular momentum\" operators J\u02c61 , J\u02c62 , J\u02c63 given by\nd\nJ\u02c6j = i~ \u03a3r,l etEj\ndt\n\n\u0001\n\n.\nt=0\n\nIf \u03c8 is a (generalized) eigenvector for the position operators with X1 \u03c8 = X2 \u03c8 =\n0 and X3 \u03c8 = r\u03c8, our choice of a representation of the little group means that\nJ\u02c63 \u03c8 = ~l\u03c8.\nThe position and angular momentum operators satisfy relations analogous\nto (7):\n1\n[Xj , Xk ] = 0\ni~\n1 \u02c6\n[Jj , Xk ] = \u03b5jkl Xl\ni~\n1 \u02c6 \u02c6\n[Jj , Jk ] = \u03b5jkl J\u02c6l .\ni~\n\n(14)\n\nThe choice of a sphere of radius r in the Wigner\u2013Mackey method gives us the\nadditional algebraic relation\nX * X = r2 .\n(15)\n10\n\n\fFinally, the parameter l, labeling the chosen representation of the little group,\ndetermines one additional relation:\n\u0134 * X = r~l.\n\n(16)\n\nTo see that this relation is true, we can easily verify that \u0134 * X commutes with\neach J\u02c6j and each Xj , which means that this operator must act as a constant\nmultiple of the identity in each irreducible representation. The value of this\nconstant can be determined by evaluating on a (generalized) vector \u03c8 such that\nX1 \u03c8 = X2 \u03c8 = 0 and X3 \u03c8 = r, on which we have \u0134 * X\u03c8 = rJ\u02c63 \u03c8 = r~l\u03c8, by\nassumption.\nComparing (16) to (8) in the classical case, it is natural to make the following\nidentification, which relates the value of l on the quantum side to the value of\nB on the classical side:\nB\n~l\n\u2212\n(17)\n= 2.\nr\nr\nThat is to say, if we make the identification (17), then (16) becomes identical\nto the classical formula:\n\u0134 * X = \u2212r3 B.\n(18)\nNow, (17) is equivalent to the condition\n\u2212\n\n(4\u03c0r2 )B\n= 2l,\n2\u03c0~\n\n(19)\n\nwhere 2l is a non-negative integer. Equation (19) says that the area of the\nsphere, with respect to the magnetic 2-form-which is B times the area form-\nmust be an integer multiple of 2\u03c0~. Since the restriction of the canonical 2-form\n\u03c9 to S 2 \u2282 T S 2 is zero, an equivalent formulation of the condition is that the\nsymplectic area of the sphere S 2 \u2282 T S 2 with respect to \u03c9 B has to be an integer\nmultiple of 2\u03c0~. This last condition is the usual integrality condition in the\ntheory of quantization of symplectic manifolds. (See, for example, [29].)\nNote that we have taken the position and angular momentum operators as\nthe \"basic\" operators of our theory. If we wish to introduce linear momentum\noperators, we must define them in terms of the angular momentum operators.\nSince we have, classically, p = J \u00d7 x/r2 , it is reasonable to define the quantum\nversion of p by the analogous relation:\nP :=\n\n1\n\u0134 \u00d7 X.\nr2\n\n(20)\n\nThese linear momentum operators will come up in the computation of the annihilations operators in the next subsection.\n\n4.2\n\nThe quantum complexifier method\n\nWe work in a Hilbert space constituting an irreducible representation of \u1ebc(3),\nwith operators J\u02c6j and Xj satisfying the commutation relations (14) along with\n11\n\n\fthe algebraic relations (15) and (16). We assume that the quantum counterpart\n\u0124 to the classical energy function is equal to J\u02c62 /(2mr2 ) plus a constant, in\nwhich case our complexifier operator is\ncomplexifier =\n\nenergy\nJ\u02c62\n+ const.,\n=\n\u03b1\n2m\u03b1r2\n\n(21)\n\nas in the classical case. Here, the parameter \u03b1, having units of frequency, is\nthe same one used in Section 3.2. As in the classical setting, the constant on\nthe right-hand side of (21) has no effect on the complexifier method, as will be\nevident shortly.\nFollowing the quantum version of Thiemann's method [15], we define operators Aj by formula\nAj = ei[*,complexifier]/(i~) (Xj ) =\n\n\u221e \u0012\nX\n\nn=0\n\n1\n2m\u03b1r2 ~\n\n\u0013n\n\n[* * * [[Xj , J\u02c62 ], J\u02c62 ], . . . J\u02c62 ]. (22)\n{z\n}\n|\nn\n\nWe will interpret these operators as the annihilation operators for our system.\nBy a standard identity (see, for example, Proposition 2.25 and Exercise 2.19 in\n[30]), we have the alternative expression\n(\n)\n(\n)\nJ\u02c62\nJ\u02c62\nAj = exp \u2212\nXj exp\n.\n(23)\n2m\u03b1r2 ~\n2m\u03b1r2 ~\nFor purposes of computing the coherent states, the expression (23) is the most\nuseful formula for the annihilation operators. In particular, from (23), we can\nsee that\n1\n[Aj , Ak ] = 0\n(24)\ni~\nand\nAj Aj = r2 .\n(25)\nWe now look for quantum counterparts to the expressions for a(x, p) in (10)\nand Theorem 1. In computing the commutator of Xj with J\u02c62 , we get products\n\u02c6 in both orders. If we move, say, all the J's\n\u02c6 to the left we obtain\nof X's and J's\na quantum correction as follows:\n\"\n#\n\u0011\nJ\u02c62\n1 \u0010\n1\nX,\n=\n\u0134 \u00d7 X \u2212 i~X ,\n2\n2\ni~\n2m\u03b1r\nm\u03b1r\nas may easily be verified. Now, since J\u02c62 commutes with each J\u02c6j , we may treat\n\u0134 as a constant in computing subsequent commutators. Thus,\n(\n)\ni(\u0134 \u00d7 *) + ~\nA = exp\n(X) .\n(26)\nm\u03b1r2\n\n12\n\n\fIn the case ~/(m\u03b1r2 ) = 1, this expression is essentially Equation (4.7) of [16],\nwhich should be expected, since we have thus far used only the commutation\nrelations (14) and not (15) or (16). Equation (26) also coincides with the d = 2\ncase of Equation (33) of [14]. (The notation JX in [14] corresponds, in the d = 2\ncase, to \u0134 \u00d7 X in the notation of the current article.)\nWe now compute the annihilation operators \"explicitly\" in a form similar to\nthe expressions for a(x, p) in Theorem 1. Recalling the definition (20) of the\nlinear momentum operators, a straightforward computation gives:\n\u0134 \u00d7 X = r2 P\nJ\u02c62\n\u0134 \u00d7 P = \u2212 2 X + i~P \u2212 rBJ.\nr\nThus, if we cross with \u0134 repeatedly, we will obtain expressions involving \u0134 in\naddition to X and P. In the quantum case, \u0134 \u00d7 \u0134 is not zero:\n\u0134 \u00d7 \u0134 = i~\u0134.\nThe action of the operation of \"crossing with \u0134\" on the vector operators X, P,\nand \u0134 can thus be encoded in the following matrix:\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n\u02c62\n0 \u2212 Jr2 0\n\u0134 \u00d7 * = \uf8ed r2\n(27)\ni~\n0 \uf8f8.\n0 \u2212rB i~\n\nSince entries of the matrix in (27) commute, we can think of it as an ordinary\n3 \u00d7 3 matrix. We then put in this matrix in place of the expression \u0134 \u00d7 * in\n(26) and exponentiate. The matrix exponential can be computed explicitly by\nMathematica, and the first column of the exponential gives us the result of\napplying the quantum complexifier to X. The matrix in (27) is block-upper\ntriangular and the upper left 2 \u00d7 2 block is the same as the matrix in [14]; as a\nresult, the upper 2 \u00d7 2 block in the exponential is the same as the exponential\nof the matrix in [14]. Thus, the expression for A will be the same as the d = 2\ncase of Equation (38) of [14], except that there will be an extra term involving\n\u0134. (Recall that what we call \u03b1 here corresponds to \u03c9 in [14].) We record the\nanswer in the following theorem.\nTheorem 3 Let us introduce the shifted, dimensionless angular momentum operator\nq\nJ\u02c62 + ~2 /4\n.\nL\u0302 =\nm\u03b1r2\nThen we obtain\n!\n~ sinh L\u0302\n~/(2m\u03b1r 2 )\ncosh L\u0302 +\nA=e\nX\n2m\u03b1r2 L\u0302\n+ ie~/(2m\u03b1r\n\n2\n\n) sinh L\u0302\n\nL\u0302\n\n\u0134\nP\n\u2212 \u039bB 2 2 ,\nm\u03b1\nm \u03b1 r\n\n13\n\n(28)\n\n\fwhere\n\u039b=\n\n1\nL\u03022 \u2212 (~/(2m\u03b1r2 ))\n\n2\n\n(\n\n1+e\n\n~/(2m\u03b1r 2 )\n\n!)\n~ sinh L\u0302\n\u2212 cosh L\u0302\n.\n2m\u03b1r2 L\u0302\n\nWhen B = 0, the expression for A agrees (upon setting ~/(m\u03b1r2 ) = 1) with\nEquation (4.16) of [17] . The B = 0 case of Theorem 3 also agrees with the\nd = 2 case of Equation (38) in [14]. On the other hand, taking the limit as ~\ntends to zero in (28)-and identifying L\u0302 with L-gives the expression for the\nclassical function a(x, p) in Theorem 1.\n\n5\n\nThe coherent states\n\nWe define a state \u03c8 to be a coherent state is \u03c8 is a simultaneous eigenvector\nfor the operators Aj :\nAj \u03c8 = aj \u03c8.\nSince the Aj 's commute (see (24)) it is reasonable to hope that there are many\ncoherent states. Since also Aj Aj = r2 , we must have\na21 + a22 + a23 = r2 ,\nmeaning that the vector a := (a1 , a2 , a3 ) must belong to SC2 \u2282 C3 .\nTheorem 4 For each a \u2208 SC2 , there exists a nonzero, normalizable vector \u03c7a\nin the quantum Hilbert space such that\nAj \u03c7a = aj \u03c7a .\nFor a in the real sphere S 2 , we may compute \u03c7a as\n)\n(\nJ\u02c62\n\u03b4a ,\n\u03c7a = exp \u2212\n2m\u03b1r2 ~\nwhere \u03b4a is a (non-normalizable) vector satisfying Xj \u03b4a = aj \u03b4a .\nFor each a in the real sphere S 2 , the space of (generalized) eigenvectors\n\u03c8 for X satisfying Xj \u03c8 = aj \u03c8 is one-dimensional. When l 6= 0, there is no\nway to pick a nonzero element \u03b4a of each eigenspace that depends continuously\non a. Thus, there is no continuous way to parameterize the coherent states as\nvectors, even for parameters in the real sphere. Physically, however, it is only\nthe one-dimensional subspace spanned by the coherent state that is important,\nand these subspaces depend continuously (in fact, holomorphically) on a \u2208 SC2 .\nProof. As explained in detail in Section 6, there is a \"position representation\"\nin which our Hilbert space is the space of square-integrable sections of complex\nline bundle over S 2 . Then for a \u2208 SC2 , the coherent state \u03c7a is nothing but\nthe \"bundle heat kernel,\" evaluated at a point in the fiber over a. It is well\n14\n\n\fknown that such bundle heat kernel always exists and is smooth, so that \u03c8a\nis a normalizable (finite-norm) vector. For general a \u2208 SC2 , we need to show\nthat the bundle heat kernel can be analytically continued with respect to the\nparameter a from S 2 to SC2 . It suffices to show that any solution of the bundle\nheat equation can be analytically continued from S 2 to SC2 , which we will show\nin Section 6 by the method of reduction to the group case. (In the group case,\nthe existence of the analytic continuation of the heat kernel was shown in detail\nin Section 4 of [1].)\nComputations of the heat kernel for the \"spinor\" case (l = 1/2) can be found\nin [31].\n\n6\n\nThe Segal\u2013Bargmann representation\n\nIn this section we construct a Segal\u2013Bargmann representation associated to the\ncoherent states, and an associated unitary Segal\u2013Bargmann transform. That\nis to say, the transform consists of taking the inner product of a state \u03c8 with\neach coherent state \u03c7a , resulting in a function of a. Because the coherent states\ndepend holomorphically on a, we get a holomorphic function on SC2 , or rather,\na holomorphic section of a certain line bundle over SC2 . The unitarity of the\nSegal\u2013Bargmann transform is equivalent to resolution of the identity for the\ncoherent states, as we explain in Section VII of [14].\n\n6.1\n\nThe Schr\u00f6dinger Hilbert space\n\nIn Section 4.1, we considered irreducible representations of the double cover of\nthe Euclidean group \"in the abstract.\" That is, we never give a concrete realization of the Hilbert space, but rather perform all calculations using only the\ncommutation relations of the Lie algebra together with the two algebraic relations (15) and (16) that characterize the particular irreducible representation.\nWe now wish to give a concrete realization of a given irreducible representation,\nas a space of square-integrable \"sections\" over the real sphere.\nIf (\u03a0, V ) is a finite-dimensional representation of SU(2), define operators \u03c3j\nby\n\u0001\nd\n,\n(29)\n\u03c3j = i~ \u03a0 etEj\ndt\nt=0\n\nwhere Ej is defined in (13). For each non-negative integer or half-integer l, let\n(\u03a0l , Vl ) be the irreducible unitary representation of SU(2) in which the largest\neigenvalue of \u03c33 is ~l. Now let L2 (S 2 ; Vl ) denote the space of square-integrable\nfunctions on S 2 with values in Vl . Define angular momentum operators J\u02c6j on\nthis space by\nJ\u02c6j = Lj + \u03c3j\n(30)\nwhere the Lj 's are the usual orbital angular momentum operators given by\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u2202\n\u2202\n\u2212 x3\nL1 = \u2212i~ x2\n\u2202x3\n\u2202x2\n15\n\n\fand relations obtained from this by cyclic permutations of the indices.\nFor any integer or half-integer l (positive or negative), the Schr\u00f6dinger \"realization\" of the associated representation of \u1ebc(3) corresponding to that value\nof l will be a certain subspace of the Hilbert space L2 (S 2 ; V|l| ). (Here l is the\nparameter in (16) and (17) in our analysis of the representations of \u1ebc(3).)\nDefinition 5 For any integer or half-integer l, the Schr\u00f6dinger Hilbert space,\ndenoted \u03932 (S 2 ; l), is the subspace of L2 (S 2 ; V|l| ) consisting of functions \u03c8 : S 2 \u2192\nVl with the property that for all x \u2208 S 2 ,\n(\u03c3 * x) \u03c8(x) = r~l\u03c8(x).\n\n(31)\n\nHere, \u03c3 is defined by (29). The norm of such a function \u03c8 is computed as\nZ\n2\n|\u03c8(x)|2l dx,\nk\u03c8kl =\nS2\n\nwhere |*|l is the SU(2)-invariant norm on Vl and dx is the surface-area measure\non S 2 .\nThe notation \u0393 is commonly used to denote sections of a vector bundle\nover some manifold. The notation \u03932 (S 2 ; l) then denotes the space of squareintegrable sections of the complex line bundle over S 2 labeled by l.\nAt each point x \u2208 S 2 , the space of possible values for \u03c8(x) is one dimensional.\nIf, for example, we take x = n, then \u03c8(n) must lie in the eigenspace for \u03c33 with\neigenvalue ~l.\nIf l = 1, the matrices Fj := d\u03a0l (etEj )/dt t=0 form the standard basis for\nso(3), and we may calculate that\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n0 \u2212x3\nx2\n0 \u2212x1 \uf8f8\nx * \u03c3 = i~ \uf8ed x3\n\u2212x2\nx1\n0\nand thus that\n\n(x * \u03c3)(v) = i~ x \u00d7 v.\nThe Schr\u00f6dinger Hilbert space may then be described as the space of squareintegrable functions \u03c8 : S 2 \u2192 C3 such that\nx\n\u00d7 \u03c8(x) = i\u03c8(x).\nr\n\n(32)\n\nWe have described the Schr\u00f6dinger Hilbert space as a Hilbert space; it remains to describe the action of the Euclidean Lie algebra on it. The action of\nthe position operators is simple enough: we put Xj \u03c8(x) equal to xj \u03c8(x). For\nthe action of the angular momentum operators, we wish to continue to use the\nformula in (30). For this to make sense, we must show that the space \u03932 (S 2 ; l)\nof functions satisfying (31) is invariant under the operators J\u02c6j in (30). To verify\n\n16\n\n\fthis invariance, we may easily verify that \u03932 (S 2 ; l) is invariant under the action\nSU(2) given by\n(U * \u03c8)(x) = \u03a0l (U )\u03c8(RU x),\n(33)\nwhere as in Definition 5, RU is the element of SO(3) corresponding to the\nelement U of SU(2). The operators J\u02c6j are obtained by differentiating the action\nof exp(tFj ) at t = 0. Since \u03932 (S 2 ; l) is invariant under the group action in (33),\nit is also invariant under the associated Lie algebra action in (30).\n\n6.2\n\nThe Segal\u2013Bargmann Hilbert space\n\nWe now define the Segal\u2013Bargmann space over SC2 associated to a given value\nof l and an arbitrary positive, matrix-valued density \u03bd on SC2 .\nDefinition 6 For any integer or half-integer l, the space of holomorphic\nsections over SC2 , denoted H(SC2 ; l), is the space of holomorphic functions \u03a8 :\nSC2 \u2192 V|l| with the property that\n(\u03c3 * a)(\u03a8(a)) = r~l\u03a8(a)\n\n(34)\n\nfor all a \u2208 SC2 . Let \u03bd : SC2 \u2192 Pos(Vl ) be a continuous map into the space\nof positive, self-adjoint operators on V|l| . Then the Segal\u2013Bargmann space,\ndenoted H2 (SC2 ; l, \u03bd), associated to \u03bd is the space of \u03c8 in H(SC2 ; l) such that\nZ\n2\nh\u03c8(z) |\u03bd(z)| \u03c8(z)il dz < \u221e.\nk\u03c8k\u03bd :=\nSC2\n\nHere dz is the SO(3; C)-invariant measure on SC2 described in Section 6 in [14],\nand h*|*il is the SU(2)-invariant inner product on Vl .\nWe now wish to describe a map from \u03932 (S 2 ; l) to H(SC2 ; l). This map will\nconsist of applying a smoothing operator to \u03c8 \u2208 \u03932 (S 2 ; l) and then analytically\ncontinuing from S 2 to SC2 .\nProposition 7 For all \u03c8 \u2208 \u03932 (S 2 ; l), consider the section \u03a8 given by\n(\n)\nJ\u02c62\n\u03a8 = exp \u2212\n\u03c8.\n2m\u03b1r2 ~\n\n(35)\n\nThen \u03a8 admits a unique extension from S 2 to a holomorphic map of SC2 into\nVl , and this extension is an element of H(SC2 ; l). We refer to \u03a8 as the Segal\u2013\nBargmann transform of \u03c8.\nNote the similarity between the definition (35) of the Segal\u2013Bargmann transform and the formula for the coherent states in Theorem 4. This similarity\nindicates that the Segal\u2013Bargmann transform \u03a8 at a point a is simply the inner\nproduct of \u03c8 with the coherent state \u03c7a . The Segal\u2013Bargmann transform is the\nmore convenient description in this case, simply because there is no continuous\n17\n\n\fway of parameterizing the coherent states, due to the nontriviality of the bundle\nwe are working with.\nThe Segal\u2013Bargmann space and transform should be compared to the spaces\nin [32] and [33] in the Cn case. (See [34] for more information.) The proof of\nthis result is deferred to Section 6.4, where it will be proved by reduction to the\ngroup case. We will also see that there is a certain natural choice for \u03bd such\nthat the Segal\u2013Bargmann transform is unitary.\n\n6.3\n\nUnitarity of the Segal\u2013Bargmann transform\n\nFor convenience of computation, let us write the operator occurring in the exponent in (35) as\nJ\u02c62\n1\n= \u03c4 J \u03032 ,\n(36)\n2m\u03b1r2 ~\n2\nwhere J \u0303 is a dimensionless version of J\u02c6 given by\nJ\u02c6k\nJ \u0303k =\n~\nand where \u03c4 is the dimensionless parameter given by\n\u03c4=\n\n~\n.\nm\u03b1r2\n\n(The reader should not confuse J \u0303 with the dimensionless quantities L and L\u0302\noccurring in the formulas for the map a(x, p) and the annihilation operators.\nIn computing L, we divide by m\u03b1r2 rather than by ~.)\nIn [14], we argued that \u03c4 controls the ratio of the spatial width of the coherent\nstates to the radius of the sphere. Specifically, if \u2206X denotes the spatial width\nof a coherent state (measured in some reasonable way), then we expect that\nr\n\u2206X\n\u03c4\n\u2248\n,\nr\n2\nat least when \u03c4 \u226a 1.\nTheorem 8 For each integer or half-integer l and each \u03c4 > 0, there exists a\nfunction \u03bd\u03c4l with values in positive operators on Vl such that the Segal\u2013Bargmann\ntransform is a unitary map of \u03932 (S 2 ; l) onto H2 (SC2 ; l, \u03bd\u03c4l ).\nThis result is proved in the following subsection. See Theorem 10 for a\nformula for \u03bd\u03c4l .\n\n6.4\n\nReduction to the group case\n\nIn this subsection, we begin with the Segal\u2013Bargmann transform for the compact\nLie group SU(2), as described in [1]. We then \"twist\" this transform with the\n18\n\n\fspace Vl carrying an irreducible representation of SU(2). Next, we allow the\nresulting transform to descend from SU(2) to SU(2)/D = S 2 , obtaining a Segal\u2013\nBargmann transform for Vl -valued functions on S 2 , with respect to a \"covariant\"\nLaplacian that can be computed as the sum of squares of the operators J\u02c6j in\n(30). Finally, we restrict the Segal\u2013Bargmann transform for Vl -valued functions\non S 2 to the subspace of functions satisfying the condition (31).\nRecall from (13) the basis {E1 , E2 , E3 } for su(2), satisfying [Ej , Ek ] = \u03b5jkl El .\nWe then take the inner product on su(2) for which these elements are orthonormal. For each j, we form the self-adjoint operator \u03a3j on L2 (SU(2)) (with respect\nto the Haar measure), given by\n(\u03a3j \u03c6)(x) = i\n\n\u0001\nd\n\u03c6 e\u2212tEj x\ndt\n\n.\nt=0\n\nWe then form the Laplacian \u2206 (here taken to be a positive operator) given by\n\u2206 = \u03a3j \u03a3j .\nUsing \u2206, we form the heat operator e\u2212\u03c4 \u2206/2 .\nTheorem 9 Fix a positive number \u03c4. Then for each \u03c6 \u2208 L2 (SU(2)), the function \u03a6 := e\u2212\u03c4 \u2206/2 \u03c6 admits a holomorphic extension from SU(2) to SL(2; C).\nFurthermore, there is a smooth positive density \u03bd\u03c4 on SL(2; C) such that\nZ\n2\n2\nk\u03c6kL2 (SU(2)) =\n|\u03a6(g)| \u03bd\u03c4 (g) dg.\n(37)\nSL(2;C)\n\nFinally, if \u03a6 is any holomorphic function on SL(2; C) for which the integral on\nthe right-hand side of (37) is finite, there is a unique \u03c6 \u2208 L2 (SU(2)) for which\n\u03a6|SU(2) = e\u2212\u03c4 \u2206/2 \u03c6.\nThis result is the K = SU(2) case of Theorem 2 of [1]. There is a trivial\nextension of this theorem in which \u03c6 takes values in Vl instead of in C. This\nextended Segal\u2013Bargmann transform maps L2 (SU(2); Vl ) (square-integrable, Vl valued functions on SU(2)) to holomorphic, Vl -valued functions on SL(2; C). To\nget something slightly less trivial, we are going to \"twist\" our functions by the\naction of SU(2) on Vl . When we apply the associated \"twisted Laplacian\" to\nfunctions that are invariant under the right action of the diagonal subgroup D\nof SU(2), we obtain precisely the operator (36). The result of applying Theorem\n9 to functions of this type is the following.\nTheorem 10 Let \u03c8 be any function in L2 (S 2 ; Vl ) and let \u03c8 be the holomorphic\nfunction on SC2 whose restriction to S 2 is given by\nn\no\n\u03a8 = exp \u2212\u03c4 J \u03032 /2 \u03c8.\nThen\n\n2\n\nk\u03c8kL2 (S 2 ;Vl ) =\n\nZ\n\nSC2\n\n\u03a8(z), \u03bd\u03c4l (z)\u03a8(z)\n19\n\nl\n\ndz,\n\n\fwhere \u03bd\u03c4l is the function with values in positive operators on Vl given by\nZ\n\u0001\n\u03a0l ((gh)\u22121 )\u2217 (gh)\u22121 \u03bd\u03c4 (gh) dh\n\u03bd\u03c4l (Rg n) =\nDC\n\nfor each g \u2208 SL(2; C). Here Rg is the element of SO(3; C) associated to g \u2208\nSL(2; C). Furthermore, if \u03c8 has the property (31), the \u03a8 has the property (34).\nUsing a slight variant of the method of Flensted-Jensen [35], one can show\nthat the function \u03bd\u03c4l satisfies a bundle heat equation over hyperbolic 2-space,\nwhich is the noncompact symmetric space dual (in the usual duality between\ncompact and noncompact symmetric spaces) to S 2 .\nProof. To each function \u03c6 \u2208 L2 (SU(2); Vl ), let us associate another function \u03c6\u0303\ngiven by\n\u03c6\u0303(x) = \u03a0l (x)\u03c6(x).\nSince \u03a0l is unitary, \u03c6 and \u03c6\u0303 have the same norm.\nFor y \u2208 SU(2), let Ly denote the \"ordinary\" left action of y on some \u03c8 \u2208\nL2 (SU(2); Vl ), namely\n(Ly \u03c6)(x) = \u03c6(y \u22121 x).\nWe may also introduce the twisted left action L\u0303y given by\n(L\u0303y \u03c8)(x) = \u03a0(y)\u03c8(y \u22121 x).\nIt is easily verified that\n^\n(L\ny \u03c6) = L\u0303y \u03c6\u0303.\nDifferentiating this relation, we find that\n^\n(\u03a3\nj \u03c6) = \u03a3\u0303j \u03c6\u0303,\nwhere\n(\u03a3\u0303j \u03c8)(x) =\nIt is then easy to see that\n\nwhere\n\n\u0001\nd\n\u03c8 e\u2212tEj x + \u03c0l (Ej )\u03c8(x).\ndt\n\n\u0001\n \u0303\n^\n\u2206/2 \u03c6 = e\u2212\u03c4 \u2206/2\ne\u2212\u03c4\n\u03c6\u0303,\n \u0303 = \u03a3\u0303j \u03a3\u0303j .\n\u2206\n\nThus, if \u03a6 is the holomorphic extension of e\u2212\u03c4 \u2206/2 \u03c6 and \u03a6\u0303 is the holomorphic\n \u0303\nextension of e\u2212\u03c4 \u2206/2 \u03c6\u0303, we have\n\u03a6(g) = \u03a0(g \u22121 )\u03a6\u0303(g).\n\n20\n\n(38)\n\n\fLet us now apply the Segal\u2013Bargmann transform for SU(2) (trivially extended\nto Vl -valued functions), to \u03c8, and express the result in terms of \u03a8\u0303 by means of\n(38):\n2\n\n\u03c6\u0303\n\n2\n\n= k\u03c6kL2 (SU(2);Vl )\nZ\nh\u03a6(g), \u03a6(g)il \u03bd\u03c4 (g) dg\n=\nSL(2;C)\nZ\nD\nE\n\u03a0(g \u22121 )\u03a6\u0303(g), \u03a0(g \u22121 )\u03a6\u0303(g) \u03bd\u03c4 (g) dg\n=\nl\nSL(2;C)\nZ\nD\nE\n\u03a6\u0303(g), \u03a0(g \u22121 )\u2217 \u03a0(g \u22121 )\u03a6\u0303(g) \u03bd\u03c4 (g) dg\n=\nl\nSL(2;C)\nZ\nE\nD\n\u0001\n\u03a6\u0303(g), \u03a0 (g \u22121 )\u2217 g \u22121 \u03a6\u0303(g) \u03bd\u03c4 (g) dg.\n=\n\nL2 (SU(2);Vl )\n\nl\n\nSL(2;C)\n\n(39)\n\nNow, let D be the diagonal subgroup of SU(2), so that SU(2)/D = S 2 ,\nand let DC be the complexification of D, which is just the diagonal subgroup of\nSL(2; C). It is easy to see that the twisted left action of SU(2) commutes with the\nordinary right action of SU(2). It follows that the space of functions on SU(2)\n \u0303 and\nthat are invariant under the ordinary right action of D is invariant under \u2206\n \u0303\n\u2212\u03c4 \u2206/2\nthus under the heat operator e\n. Thus, if we apply (39) in the case that \u03c6\u0303\nis invariant under the ordinary right action of D, \u03a6\u0303 will be invariant under the\nordinary right action of D and thus also (because \u03a6\u0303 is holomorphic) under the\nordinary right action of DC . Meanwhile, we can break up the integration over\nSL(2; C) into an integral over DC followed by an integration over SL(2; C)/DC .\nThus, (39) becomes, when \u03c6\u0303 is right-D-invariant,\n\u03c6\u0303\n=\n\n2\nL2 (SU(2);Vl )\n\nZ\n\nSL(2;C)/DC\n\nZ\n\nDC\n\nD\nE\n\u0001\n\u03a6\u0303(g), \u03a0 ((gh)\u22121 )\u2217 (gh)\u22121 \u03a6\u0303(g) \u03bd\u03c4 (gh) dh d[g],\nl\n\nwhere d[g] is the SL(2; C)-invariant volume measure on SL(2; C)/DC . After identifying SL(2; C)/DC with SC2 and d[g] with the invariant volume measure on SC2 ,\nwe obtain the first claimed result in the theorem.\nIf \u03c8 (= \u03c6\u0303) is a right-D-invariant function on SU(2), it descends to a function\non SU(2)/D = S 2 . Furthermore, the action \u03a3\u0303j on this function corresponds\nto the action of the J \u0303j on the associated function on the sphere. Thus, the\ntwisted Segal\u2013Bargmann transform for \u03c8 is just the transform associated to the\noperator exp(\u2212\u03c4 J \u03032 /2) on S 2 . Meanwhile, it is easily seen operators J \u0303j preserve\nthe condition (31). Thus, we can specialize our transform on L2 (S 2 ; Vl ) to the\nsubspace \u03932 (S 2 ; l).\n\nReferences\n[1] Hall B C, 1994 J. Funct. Anal. 122 103\n21\n\n\fHall B C, 1997 J. Funct.
