Recently, polynomial-time algorithms for\nfinding a sun for a larger class of graphs, the so-called HHD-free graphs, have been discovered.\nIn this paper, we prove the problem of deciding whether an arbitrary graph contains a sun in\nNP-complete.\n\nKeywords: chordal graph, strongly chordal graph, sun\n\n1 Introduction\nA hole is an induced cycle with at least four vertices. A graph is chordal if it does not contain a hole\nas an induced subgraph. Farber [6] defined a graph to be strongly chordal if it is chordal and every\ncycle in the graph on 2k vertices, k \u2265 3, has a chord uv such that each segment of the cycle from\nu to v has an odd number of edges. We denote by k-sun the graph obtained from a cycle of length\n2k (k \u2265 3) by adding edges to make the even-indexed vertices pairwise adjacent. Figure 1 shows a\n5-sun. A sun is simply a k-sun for some k \u2265 3. Farber showed [6] that a graph is strongly chordal if\nand only if it is chordal and does not contain a sun as induced subgraph. Farber's motivation was a\npolynomial-time algorithm for the minimum weighted dominating set problem for strongly chordal\ngraphs. The problem is NP-hard for chordal graphs [1]. In this paper, we prove that it is NP-hard to\nfind a sun in an arbitrary graph. This result is motivated by the following discussion on chordal and\nstrongly chordal graphs. For more information on this topics, see [3, 7].\nWe use N (x) to denote the set of vertices adjacent to vertex x in a graph G. Define N [x] =\nN (x) \u222a {x}. A vertex x in a graph is simplicial if N (x) induces a complete graph. It is well known\n[4] that graph G is chordal if and only if every induced subgraph H of G contains a simplicial vertex\nof H. Farber proved [6] an analogous characterization for strongly chordal graphs. A vertex x in a\n\u2217\nDepartment of Physics and Computer Science, Wilfrid Laurier University, Canada.

Thus, every simple vertex is simplicial. For a graph G, let R = v1 , v2 , . . . , vn be an\nordering of vertices of G. Let G(i) = G[{vi , vi+1 , . . . , vn }], i.e., the subgraph induced in G by\nthe set vi through vn of vertices. R is a simple elimination ordering for G if vi is simple in G(i),\n1 \u2264 i \u2264 n. The following is due to Farber [6]:\nTheorem 1 ([6]) The following are equivalent for any graph G:\n\u2022 G is strongly chordal.\n\u2022 G is chordal and does not contain a sun.\n\u2022 Vertices of G admit a simple elimination ordering.\nThus, suns play an important role in the studies of chordal and strongly chordal graphs. There are\nwell known algorithms [17, 12] to test whether a chordal graph is strongly chordal and thus whether\nit contains a sun. It is natural to investigate the problem for larger classes of graphs. A graph is\nHHD-free if it does not contain a house, a hole, or a domino (see figure 2). Every chordal graph\nis a HHD-free graph. HHD-free graphs [10] have several properties analogous to those of chordal\ngraphs. Brandst\u00e4dt [2] proposed the problem of finding a sun in a HHD-free graph. This problem\nwas proved to be polynomial-time solvable in [13] and [5]. In this paper, we will prove the following\n\nTheorem 2 It is NP-complete to decide whether a graph contains a sun.\n2\n\n\fDenote by k-hole the hole on k vertices. A k-antihole is the complement of a k-hole. A graph is\nweakly chordal [8] if it does not contain a k-hole or k-antihole with k \u2265 5. Weakly chordal graphs\ngeneralize chordal graphs in a natural way, and they are known to be perfect and have many interesting algorithmic properties (see [9]). In spite of Theorem 2, it is conceivable there are polynomialtime algorithms to solve the sun recognition problem for weakly chordal graphs or even perfect\ngraphs [15]. In this spirit, we will refine Theorem 2 to obtain a stronger result.\nTheorem 3 It is NP-complete to decide whether a graph G contains a sun, even when G does not\ncontain a k-antihole with k \u2265 7.\nLet k-CLIQUE (respectively, k-SUN) be the problem whose instance is a graph G and an integer k,\nfor which the question to be answered is whether G contains a clique on k vertices (respectively, kSUN). It is well known [11] that k-CLIQUE is NP-complete. It is not difficult to prove, but perhaps\ninteresting to note that k-SUN is also NP-complete. Observe that if k is a constant (not part of the\ninput), then the two problems can obviously be solved in polynomial time.\nTheorem 4 k-SUN is NP-complete.\nNote that Theorem 2 implies Theorem 4: To decide whether a graph contains a sun, we only need\nsolve O(n) instances of k-SUN with k running from 3 to n/2, where n is the number of vertices\nof the graph. However, we have a short and direct proof of Theorem 4. We will give the proofs of\nTheorems 2, 3 and 4 in the remainder of the paper.\n\n2 The proofs\nFirst, we need introduce some definitions. For simplicity, we will say a vertex x sees a vertex y if\nx is adjacent to y; otherwise, we will say x misses y. Let G, F be two vertex-disjoint graphs and\nlet x be a vertex of G. We say that a graph H is obtained from G by substituting F for x if H is\nobtained by replacing x by F in G and adding the edge ab for any a \u2208 V (G) \u2212 {x}, and any b \u2208 F\nwhenever ax is an edge of G. In the proofs, we will often use the observation that every vertex in\nH \u2212 F either sees all, or misses all, vertices of F .\nBy (c1 , c2 , . . . , ck , e1 , e2 , . . . , ek ) we denote the k-sun with vertices c1 , c2 , . . . , ck , e1 , e2 , . . . , ek\nsuch that c1 , c2 , . . . , ck induce a clique, e1 , e2 , . . . , ek induce a stable set, each ei has degree two\nand sees ci , ci+1 with the subscripts taken modulo k. The vertices ei will be called the ears of the\nk-sun. A triangle is a clique on three vertices.\nWe will rely on the following NP-complete problem due to Poljak [14].\nSTABLE SET IN TRIANGLE-FREE GRAPHS\nInstance: A triangle-free graph G, an integer k.\nQuestion: Does G contain a stable set with k vertices?\nProof of Theorem 2. We will reduce STABLE SET IN TRIANGLE-FREE GRAPHS to the problem\nof finding a sun in a graph.\n3\n\n\fv\n\nv\n\n1\n\nv\n\n2\n\n3\n\nFigure 3: The graph G\nV\n\n2\nV\n\nV\n\n3\n\n1\n\nv\n\n4\n3\n\nv\n\n4\n1\n\nv\n\n3\n3\n\nv\n\n3\n1\n\nv\n\n2\n3\n\nv\n\n2\n1\n\nv\n\n1\n3\n\nv\n\n1\n1\n\nW\nu1\n\nw1\n\nu2\nx1\n\nw2\n\nu3\n\nx2\n\nw3\n\nx3\n\nu\n\nw\n4\n\n4\n\nX\n\nx4\n\nFigure 4: The graph f(G,4)\nLet G = (V, E) be a triangle-free graph with V = {v1 , v2 , . . . , vn }, and without loss of generality assume k \u2265 4. Define a graph f (G, k) from G as follows. Substitute for each vertex vi a\nclique Vi = {vi1 , vi2 , . . . , vik }; add a clique W with vertices u1 , w1 , . . . , uk , wk ; add a stable set X\nwith vertices x1 , . . . , xk ; for i = 1, 2, . . . , k, add edges xi wi and xi ui+1 (the subscripts are taken\nmodule k); for i = 1, 2, . . . , n and j = 1, 2, . . . k, add edges vij uj , vij wj . Figure 3 shows a graph\nG whose graph f (G, 4) is shown in Figure 4 (for clarity, we do not show all edges of f (G, 4); all\nadjacency between V1 and W , and between V2 and W are shown, adjacency between V3 and W are\nnot shown; the thick line between V1 and V2 (and between V2 and V3 ) represents all possible edges\nbetween the two sets; there are no edges between V1 and V3 ; each of the sets Vi , W induces a clique;\nthe set X induces a stable set.) We will often rely on the following observations.\nObservation 1 Suppose G is triangle-free. Then f (G, k) does not contain a triangle each of whose\nvertices belongs to a distinct Vi . \u2737\n\n4\n\n\fObservation 2 Let x be a vertex in Vi , y be a vertex in Vj with i 6= j. If x and y have a common\nneighbor z in W , then N (x) \u2229 W = N (y) \u2229 W . \u2737\nThe theorem follows from the following claim.\nClaim 1 G has a stable set with k vertices if and only if f (G, k) contains a sun.\nProof of Claim 1. Suppose G has a stable set with vertices v1 , v2 , . . . , vk . Then f (G, k) has a 2k-sun\n(c1 , c2 , . . . , c2k , e1 , e2 , . . . , e2k ) with e2i\u22121 = vii , e2i = xi , c2i\u22121 = ui , c2i = wi , for i = 1, 2, . . . k.\nNow, suppose f (G, k) contains a sun. Write U = V1 \u222a V2 \u222a . . . \u222a Vn . We will establish that\nAny sun S of f (G, k) is a 2k-sun with k ears in V1 \u222a . . . \u222a Vn .\n\n(1)\n\nConsider a sun S = (c1 , c2 , . . . , ct , e1 , e2 , . . . , et ) of f (G, k). First, we claim that (with the\nsubscript taken modulo k)\nIf an ear ej lies in X, then ej\u22121 , ej lie in U .\n\n(2)\n\nLet xi be a vertex in X that is an ear ej of S. We may assume that cj = wi and cj+1 = ui+1 . Since\nej\u22121 sees wi and misses ui+1 , we have ej\u22121 \u2208 Vs for some s. Similarly, we have ej+1 \u2208 Vr for\nsome r. Note that r 6= s. So, (2) holds.\nSince W is a clique, S must have an ear in U \u222a X. (2) implies that\nU contains an ear of S.\n\n(3)\n\nIf ei \u2208 Vj then ci , ci+1 \u2208 W .\n\n(4)\n\nNext, we will prove\n\nSuppose (4) is false. For simplicity, we may assume i = 1 and j = 1 (we can always rename\nthe vertices of f (G, k) and S so that this is the case). We will often implicitly use the fact that a\nvertex in Va either sees all, or misses all, vertices of Vb whenever a 6= b. We will distinguish among\nseveral cases.\nCase 1: c1 , c2 \u2208 V1 . Since c3 sees c1 , c2 and misses e1 , c3 cannot be in U . Thus, c3 is in W .\nBut no vertex in W can see two vertices in V1 , a contradiction.\nCase 2: c1 \u2208 V1 , c2 \u2208 Vj for some j 6= 1. We may write j = 2. Since c3 (respectively, et ) sees\nc1 and misses e1 , c3 (respectively, et ) cannot be in U . Thus, c3 and et are in W . Observation 2, with\nz = c3 , x = c1 , y = c2 , implies et sees c2 , a contradiction to the definition of S.\nCase 3: c1 \u2208 V1 , c2 \u2208 W . This case is not possible since a vertex in W can have at most one\nneighbor in any Vj .\nCase 4: c1 , c2 \u2208 Vj for some j 6= 1. We may write j = 2. Since e2 sees c2 and misses c1 , e2 is\nin W . Since et sees c1 and misses c2 , et is in W . But then e2 sees et , a contradiction.\nCase 5: c1 \u2208 Vj , c2 \u2208 Vr with j 6= r, j 6= 1, r 6= 1. In this case, e1 , c1 , c2 contradict Observation\n1.\n5\n\n\fCase 6: c1 \u2208 Vj for some j 6= 1 and c2 \u2208 W . We may let j = 2. If c3 \u2208 W , then Observation\n2, with z = c2 , x = e1 , y = c1 implies c3 sees e1 , a contradiction to the definition of S. So, we\nhave c3 \u2208 U . Since c3 misses e1 , we have c3 6\u2208 V1 \u222a V2 . So, we may assume c3 \u2208 V3 . We\nhave e2 6\u2208 W ; for otherwise Observation 2, with z = c2 , x = c1 , y = c3 , implies e2 sees c1 , a\ncontradiction to the definition of S. We have e2 6\u2208 V1 \u222a V2 \u222a V3 since e2 misses e1 and c1 . So, we\nmay assume e2 \u2208 V4 . Since e3 (respectively, c4 , if it exists) sees c3 and misses e1 , Observation 2,\nwith z = c2 , x = e1 , y = c3 , implies e3 6\u2208 W (respectively, c4 6\u2208 W ). Since e3 (respectively, c4 , if\nit exists) misses e1 and e2 , we have e3 6\u2208 V1 \u222a V2 \u222a V3 \u222a V4 (respectively, c4 6\u2208 V1 \u222a V2 \u222a V3 \u222a V4 ).\nNow, if t = 3, then the three vertices e3 , c1 , c3 contradict Observation 1. But if t > 3, then the three\nvertices c4 , c1 , c3 contradict Observation 1.\nSo (4) holds. Next, we will establish two more assertions (where the subscripts are taken modulo\nk) below.\nIf an ear ej lies in U then ej\u22121 , ej+1 lie in X.\n\n(5)\n\nBy (4) and the definition of f (G, k), we may assume ci = ui , ci+1 = wi . Since xi is the only vertex\nof f (G, k) that sees wi and misses ui , we have xi = ej+1 . Similarly, we have xi\u22121 = ej\u22121 . So, (5)\nholds.\nIf some vertex xi \u2208 X is an ear of S, then xi+1 is also an ear of S.\n\n(6)\n\nLet xi be a vertex in X that is an ear ej of S. We may assume that cj = wi and cj+1 = ui+1 . By\n(2), we have ej+1 \u2208 Va for some a. By (4), we have cj+2 = wi+1 . By (5), ej+2 lies in X, and so\nwe have ej+2 = xi+1 . Thus, (6) holds.\nWe are now in position to prove (1). From (3), we may assume e1 lies in U . By (5), we have\ne2 \u2208 X. By (6), all xj are ears of S for j = 1, 2, . . . , k. It follows from (2) that S has exactly k ears\nin U . Therefore, S is a 2k-sun. We have proved (1).\nWe continue with the proof of the Claim (and the Theorem). Consider the k ears of S that\nbelong to U . Since each Vi is a clique, it contains at most one ear. So, there are k sets Vi containing\nan ear of S. Let these sets be V1 , V2 , . . . , Vk . Clearly, in G, the vertices v1 , v2 , . . . , vk form a stable\nset. \u2737\nProof of Theorem 3. We will use the notation defined in the proof of Theorem 2 with G being a\ntriangle-free graph. We only need prove the graph f (G, k) does not contain a t-antihole with t \u2265 7.\nWe will prove by contradiction. Suppose f (G, k) contains a t-antihole A with vertices a1 , a2 , . . . , at\nwith t \u2265 7 such that ai misses ai+1 with the subscripts taken modulo k. Since the vertices in X\nhave degree two, none of them can belong to A. Since each Vi is a clique,\nno two consecutive vertices of A can belong to the same Vi .\n\n(7)\n\nno two consecutive vertices of A can belong to W .\n\n(8)\n\none of ai , ai+1 must lie in W for all i.\n\n(9)\n\nSimilarly,\n\nNow, we claim that\n\n6\n\n\fSuppose (9) is false for ai . For simplicity, we may assume i = 1, and so we have a1 , a2 \u2208 U . By\n(7), we may assume a1 \u2208 V1 , a2 \u2208 V2 . Clearly, we have at 6\u2208 V1 .\nSuppose at \u2208 V2 . Then a3 has to be in W , for otherwise a3 lies in some Vj and so it misses\nat (since it misses a2 ) implying t = 4, a contradiction. By symmetry, we have at\u22121 \u2208 W . Since\na1 sees a3 , and at\u22121 is a common neighbour of a1 and a2 , Observation 2 implies that a2 sees a3 , a\ncontradiction to the definition of A. So, we have at 6\u2208 V2 .\nSuppose at \u2208 W . By (8), we have at\u22121 \u2208 Vj . If j = 2 then a1 misses at\u22121 , a contradiction\nto the definition of A. If j = 1 then a2 misses at\u22121 implying t = 4, a contradiction. So, we\nmay assume at\u22121 \u2208 V3 . Let j \u2208 {t \u2212 2, t \u2212 3}. If aj \u2208 W then since a2 sees at , Observation\n2 with z = aj , x = a2 , y = a1 implies a1 sees at , a contradiction to the definition of A. So,\nwe have at\u22122 \u2208 Vm for some m, and at\u22123 \u2208 Vp for some p. Since at\u22122 misses at\u22121 , we have\nat\u22122 6\u2208 V1 \u222a V2 \u222a V3 . So, we may assume m = 4. We have at\u22123 \u2208 V2 \u222a V3 , for otherwise\nthe three vertices at\u22123 , at\u22121 , a2 contradict Observation 1. Since at\u22122 sees a2 , at\u22122 sees all of\nV2 . Thus, we have at\u22123 6\u2208 V2 , and so at\u22123 \u2208 V3 . Since t \u2265 7, the vertex at\u22124 exists. Since\nat\u22124 misses at\u22123 but sees at\u22121 , at\u22124 is not in U ; so we have at\u22124 \u2208 W . Observation 2 with\nz = at\u22124 , x = at\u22121 , y = at\u22122 implies at\u22121 sees at , a contradiction to the definition of A.\nThus, at belongs to some Vj which is distinct from V1 , V2 . It follows from symmetry and the\ndefinition of f (G, k) that a3 , at\u22121 also belong to distinct Vi . Now, the three vertices at\u22121 , a1 , a3\ncontradict Observation 1. So, (9) holds.\nFrom (8) and (9), we may assume without loss of generality that ai \u2208 U whenever i is odd, and\nai \u2208 W whenever i is even. In particular, t is even and at least eight. The definition of A implies\nthat a1 sees a4 , a6 . Thus, we have {a4 , a6 } = {ui , wi } for some i. The definition of f (G, k) means\nthat every vertex of U either sees both a4 , a6 or misses both of them. But a3 misses a4 and sees a6 ,\na contradiction. \u2737\nProof of Theorem 4. We will reduce k-CLIQUE to k-SUN. Let G, k be an instance of k-CLIQUE.\nWe may assume k \u2265 4. Construct a graph h(G) from G by adding a vertex v(a, b) for each edge\nab of G, and joining v(a, b) to a and b by an edge of h(G). Let Y be the set of vertices v(a, b). It is\neasy to see that if G has a clique K on k vertices then h(G) has a k-sun induced by K and some k\nvertices in Y . If h(G) has a k-sun (c1 , . . . , ck , e1 , . . . , ek ), then since the vertices in Y have degree\ntwo, none of them can be a vertex ci ; thus, the vertices c1 , . . . , ck induce a clique on k vertices in\nG. \u2737\n\nReferences\n[1] K.
