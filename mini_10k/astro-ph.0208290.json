However, large uncertainties\nremain in our knowledge of this abundance. The solar abundance is sometimes regarded as\nthe average of our Galaxy. However, UV absorption lines due to interstellar gas and optical\nabsorption lines in the atmosphere of young B-stars have indicated that the metal abundance\nin the ISM of our Galaxy is on average about two thirds of the solar abundance (Savage &\nSembach 1996; Snow & Witt 1996). However, both methods contain uncertainties because\nthe former method is only sensitive to matter in atomic forms, while the abundance of B-star\natmospheres may be different from the ISM. Indeed, Sofia & Meyer (2001) recently claimed\nthat B-star abundances are lower than the ISM abundance and that the solar abundance is\nclose to the ISM abundance. Moreover, the O solar abundance itself is not determined well.\nRecent values by Grevesse & Sauval (1998) and Holweger (2001) are significantly lower than\nthe values in the widely used table of Anders & Grevesse (1989).\nHigh resolution X-ray spectroscopy of absorption features due to the interstellar matter\nis a powerful tool to measure the amount of interstellar metal. It is sensitive to both the\natomic (gas) and compound (molecular and dust grain) forms and can distinguish them by\nthe chemical shifts. There are absorption lines and edges of many elements in the X-ray\nenergy range. We can determine the column densities of these elements in different forms\nseparately, integrating towards the X-ray source. However, the observation requires both\nhigh energy resolution and good statistics. Schatternburg & Canizares (1986) determined\nthe O column density towards the Crab nebula with the transmission grating on the Einstein\nobservatory. They could not separate atomic and compound forms. Also they were not able\nto determine the O abundance since the H column density towards the Crab nebula was\nnot known. Paerels et al. (2001) analyzed the O and Ne absorption structures of the Xray binary X0614+091 observed with the low energy transmission grating (LETG) on the\nChandra observatory. They successfully separated the absorption features of O in atomic\nand compound forms. They also determined the abundance ratio of Ne to O. However, they\ncould not determine the O abundance because the H column density toward the source is not\nknown. Schulz et al. (2002) determined the column densities of O, Ne, Mg, Si, and Fe towards\nCyg X-1 with the Chandra high energy transmission grating (HETG) data. They discussed\nthe abundances of O, Ne, and Fe. However, it was necessary to assume the abundances of\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\nall other elements to be solar, in order to estimate the H column density towards Cyg X-1\nfrom the X-ray spectrum.\nIn this paper we analyze the spectrum of Cyg X-2 obtained with the Chandra LETG and\nHRC (High Resolution Camera)-I. Cyg X-2 is a Low-Mass X-ray Binary (LMXB) located\nat (l,b)= (87.33\u25e6 ,\u221211.32\u25e6 ) and its distance is determined to be 7.2 kpc from the optical\ncounterpart and X-ray burst with mass ejection (Cowley, Crampton, & Hutchings 1979;\nSmale 1998; Orosz & Kuulkers 1999). Smale (1998) claimed a distance of 11.6 kpc, however,\nthis is because he assumed the Eddington luminosity for a hydrogen rich atmosphere. If\nwe assume a helium rich atmosphere, which is more realistic for type-I bursts (Lewin, van\nParadijs, & Taam 1995), the distance is consistent with 7.2 kpc. Adopting this distance, Cyg\nX-2 is located \u223c 1.4 kpc above the Galactic disk. Thus the H column density towards Cyg\nX-2 can be estimated from 21 cm (H I), CO (H2 ), and H\u03b1 (H II) observations with relatively\nsmall errors. Because of the featureless X-ray spectrum of the LMXB, the high brightness,\nand the well-determined H column density to the source, Cyg X-2 is one of the best X-ray\nsources for the study of the interstellar abundance with X-ray absorption.\nIn the next section, we will first discuss the H column density towards Cyg X-2. Then\nin the following sections we will show the observational results and discuss the O and Ne\nabundances and the uncertainties of the present results.\nThroughout this paper, we quote single parameter errors at the 90 % confidence level\nunless otherwise specified.\n\n2.\n\nH column density towards Cyg X-2\n\nInterstellar hydrogen is distributed in three different forms; atomic (H I), molecular\n(H2 ), and ionic (H II).\nThe column density of atomic hydrogen is measured by the 21 cm radio emission. In\nthe H I map of Dickey & Lockman (1990), the H column density (NH ) is given at grid\npoints of 0.8 degree separation. By interpolating between the values of nearby points, the\ncolumn density in the direction of Cyg X-2 is estimated to be NH (atom)=2.17 \u00d7 1021 cm\u22122 .\nSince the scale height of atomic hydrogen is \u223c 140 pc, the total column density of our\ngalaxy can be regarded as the column density to Cyg X-2. The standard deviation of the NH\nvalues within two degrees of Cyg X-2 is 0.1\u00d71021 cm\u22122 . The power spectra of the small-scale\nspatial fluctuation of the galactic NH (atom) were measured for different directions (Crovisier\n& Dickey 1983; Dickey et al. 2001). On the spatial scales less than 1 deg, the power-law\nindex of the power spectra is in the range from \u22123 to \u22124. Assuming the same shape of the\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\npower spectrum for the spatial fluctuations in the vicinity of Cyg X-2, we estimate the rms\namplitude of the spatial fluctuation less than 2 degrees to be 0.12 \u00d7 1021 cm\u22122 and regard\nthis as the 1-\u03c3 error of the estimation.\nMiramond & Naylor (1995) determined the upper limit of molecular hydrogen column\ndensity towards Cyg X-2 from the upper limit of CO emission line in the direction of Cyg\nX-2 to be 0.05 \u00d7 1021 cm\u22122 (90 % significance level). According to them, the contribution\nof H2 in NH is smaller than 0.10 \u00d7 1021 cm\u22122 .\nThe total neutral H column density (NHI + 2NH2 ) is thus estimated to be 2.17+0.22\n\u22120.20 \u00d7\n21\n\u22122\n10 cm . On the other hand, the reddening towards Cyg X-2 is determined to be E(B \u2212\nV ) \u2243 0.4 (McClintock et al. 1984). Combining this with the relation, NHI + 2NH2 = 5.8 \u00d7\n1021 E(B \u2212 V ) atoms cm\u22122 mag\u22121 (Bohlin, Savage, & Drake 1978), we obtain NHI + 2NH2 \u2243\n2.3 \u00d7 1021 cm\u22122 , which is consistent with the above estimation.\nA large fraction (\u223c 97 %, Mathis 2000) of ionized H atoms exists in the warm ionized\ninterstellar medium (WIM) of temperature T \u223c 8000 K, distributed in our galaxy with a scale\nheight h of \u223c 900 pc and a volume filling factor f of & 0.2. In the WIM, oxygen is effectively\nionized through the charge exchange process. The number densities of neutral/ionized oxygen\nand hydrogen are related to N(O II)/N (O I) = (8/9) N(H II)/N(H I) (Field & Steigman\n1971). According to more recent model calculations by Sembach et al. (2000), the ionization\nfraction of Ne is also similar to that of H; in their 'COMPOSITE' model, the values of\nlog(N(X i )/N(Xtotal )) where X = H, O, or Ne and i represents the ionization states are,\nrespectively, \u22120.73 and \u22120.09 for H I and H II, \u22120.71 and \u22120.09 for O I and O II, and \u22120.70\nand \u22120.10 for Ne I and Ne II. Therefore, N(Xtotal )/N(Htotal ) = N(X 0 )/N(H I) is a good\napproximation for gas-phase O and Ne and we do not need to consider ionized H when we\ncalculate atomic O and Ne abundances.\nOn the other hand, since interstellar dust grains are thought to co-exist with the WIM,\nwe need to take into account the column density of ionized H when we estimate the abundance\nof O in compound forms. We estimated it from the H\u03b1 emission line intensity in the direction\nof Cyg X-2 obtained from the Wisconsin H-Alpha Mapper (WHAM) survey (Haffner et al. in\nprep) 1 . The intensity is 14.6\u00b13.8 Rayleighs. From the line intensity, the total emission measure in the column towards Cyg X-2 is estimated to be (1.28 \u00b1 0.33) \u00d7 1020 (T /8000 K) cm\u22125 ,\nwhere we applied an extinction correction factor of 1.3 assuming Rv = 3.1 (Mathis 1990).\nAssuming the spatial distribution described above, the emission measure and the column\n1\n\nhttp://www.astro.wisc.edu/wham/\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\ndensity are respectively related to the local ionized H density in the galactic plane, n0 , by,\n\u0013\u00152\n\u0012\nZ \u221e\u0014\nx sin b\n2\ndx\nEM = f * n0\nexp \u2212\nh\n0\nand\nNH (ion) = f * n0\n\nZ\n\n0\n\nd\n\n\u0013\n\u0012\nx sin b\ndx,\nexp \u2212\nh\n\nwhere d and b are the distance and the galactic latitude of Cyg X-2, respectively. From\nthese we obtain NH (ion) = 0.70 \u00b1 0.18 \u00d7 1021 (f /0.2)1/2 cm\u22122 . As a nominal value, we\nadopted NH (ion) = 0.70 \u00b1 0.18 \u00d7 1021 cm\u22122 (f = 0.2, Mathis 2000) and thus NH (total) =\n21\n2.87+0.25\ncm\u22122 . Even for f = 1, NH (ion) does not exceed 1.57 \u00b1 0.40 \u00d7 1021 cm\u22122 .\n\u22120.23 \u00d7 10\nIn Table 1, we summarize the H column densities estimated in this section.\n\n3.\n\nAnalysis and results\n\n3.1.\n\nData reduction\n\nCyg X-2 was observed with the LETG/HRC-I for 30 ks on 2000 April 24 (obsID 87).\nWe retrieved the archival data from the CXC (Chandra X-ray Center). Cyg X-2 is known\nto show both intensity and spectral variations. However, since the X-ray flux varied only\n\u223c 20 % during the observation and since we are interested only in the interstellar absorption\nfeatures, we integrated all the data after the standard data screening.\nSince the spectrum in the archival data we retrieved is known to contain some processing\nerrors2 , we reprocessed the data according to the standard methods described in threads in\nCIAO 2.2.1 (CALDB 2.10). We first obtained the spectra of the positive and negative orders.\nThen we summed them, rebinned to 0.025 \u00c5 bins, and subtracted the background. The\nbackground was only \u223c 2 % of the source counts in the wavelength region we used in the\nlater analysis.\nHRC-I has almost no energy resolution. The spectrum we obtained contains photons not\nonly of the first order dispersion but also of the higher orders. We subtracted the higher order\nspectra utilizing the method described in Paerels et al. (2001). The m-th order spectrum of\nphotons with a wavelength of \u03bb appears in the wavelength bin, \u03bb\u0302 = m\u03bb, of the first order\nspectrum. Since the LETG/HRC-I system has no detection efficiency below the wavelength\n2\n\nsee http://asc.harvard.edu/ciao/threads/spectra letghrcs/\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\n\u03bb0 , where \u03bb0 = 1 \u00c5, we can neglect the contribution of the m-th order spectrum in the\nwavelength range \u03bb\u0302 < m\u03bb0 . From the spectrum in the range \u03bb0 < \u03bb\u0302 < 2\u03bb0 and the efficiency\nratio of the second to the first order spectra, we can estimate the second order spectrum\nin the range 2\u03bb0 < \u03bb\u0302 < 4\u03bb0 and subtract it from the total spectrum to obtain the first\norder spectrum in \u03bb0 < \u03bb\u0302 < 3\u03bb0 . In the same manner, we can subtract higher order spectra\nfrom all the wavelength range. We calculated the efficiency ratio from the effective areas of\nthe LETG/HRC-S system provided at the CALDB WWW page 3 because the higher order\nefficiencies are not available for the LETG/HRC-I system and because the efficiency ratios\nare not dependent on the detector. The calibration files we used are updated compared to\nthose used by Paerels et al. (2001). We show in Figure 1 the spectra with and without higher\norders.\nWe estimated the statistical errors of the first order spectrum obtained with the above\nmethod considering the error propagations. Because of the error propagations, the statistics\nof the spectral bins are no longer completely independent. However, the increase of the\nstatistical errors after the higher order subtraction is smaller than 3% in the wavelength\nranges we use in the following analysis. We thus treat them to be independent in the\nspectral fittings.\nAccording to the LETGS calibration report at the CXC 4 , the wavelength calibration\nof LETGS spectra is accurate to 0.02 %. This is smaller by an order of magnitude than the\nstatistical errors in the wavelengths determined in the following analyses.\n\n3.2.\n\nO absorption structure and the optical depth\n\nIn the observed spectrum of Cyg X-2, we clearly found two absorption lines and an\nabsorption edge near \u03bb \u223c 23 \u00c5 besides the instrumental O absorption line and edge (see\nFigure 2). The centroid energies of the two absorption lines were determined to be 23.505 \u00b1\n0.007 \u00c5 and 23.360 \u00b1 0.014 \u00c5, and thus they were identified with the 1s\u20132p resonant lines\nof the atomic and compound O, respectively. However, since the absorption lines are saturated (\u03c4 \u226b 1), the absorption column densities cannot be determined accurately from the\nabsorption lines. We thus focus on the absorption edge.\nThe absorption edge structure was extended compared to the instrumental O K-edge,\n3\n\nletgs NOGAP EA 001031.mod for the 1st order and letgs EA 001031 om.mod for m-th order, at\nhttp://asc.harvard.edu/cal/Links/Letg/User/Hrc QE/EA/high orders/\n4\n\nsee http://cxc.harvard.edu/cal/Links/User/calstatus.html\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\nwhich suggests that the edge structure consists of absorption edge components with different\nedge energies.\nA complicated structure is expected for the absorption edge of an atomic O, firstly because photo-ionized O atoms take two distinct final states with different total spin numbers,\nand secondly because there are many absorption lines which cannot be resolved with the\nLETGS near the absorption edges (McLaughlin & Kirby 1998). The theoretical values of\nedge energies calibrated with ground experiments are 544.03 eV (22.790 \u00c5, spin 3/2) and\n548.85 eV (22.590 \u00c5, spin 1/2) (McLaughlin & Kirby 1998). On the other hand, the edge\nenergy of the compound O depends on the chemical state. Thus the absorption edge of the\ncompound forms can have an extended structure. The edge energy must be lower than the\nedge energy of atomic O, but higher than the absorption line energy. According to Sevier\n(1979), the edge energy of O in metal oxide is 532.0 \u00b1 0.4 eV (23.31 \u00b1 0.02 \u00c5).\nAll the O edge structures may not be identified because the statistics and the energy\nresolution of the present data are limited. Thus, we first apply a rather simple model to the\nobserved spectrum, then later try more and more complicated models.\nWe restricted the wavelength range of model fits in order to avoid the contributions of\nabsorption edges of other elements. We did all the analysis described below with several\ndifferent wavelength ranges. We found that the O absorption optical depth determined from\nthe analysis is not dependent on the wavelength ranges of the fits, so long as the lower and\nupper limits of the range are within the ranges 17.5\u201319.0 \u00c5 and 27.0\u201329.0 \u00c5, respectively.\nThus we show here the results with the fitting range of 18.5 \u00c5\u201328.0 \u00c5.\nWe assumed a power-law function for the continuum spectrum. We also included the absorption by neutral matter represented by the tbabs model in the 'sherpa' program (Wilms,\nAllen, & McCray 2000) with the O abundance fixed to 0. We included an O absorption\nedge with a separate absorption edge component represented by edge model in the sherpa\nprogram. We fixed the H column density of the tbabs absorption model to 2.17 \u00d7 1021 cm\u22122\nand fixed the helium abundance to the solar value. We performed the fits with the abundances of other atoms fixed at several different values between 0.5 and 1.5 solar. We found\nthat the dependence of the best-fit O absorption optical depths on the abundance of other\nelements is only about ten percent of the statistical errors. Thus we only show the results\nwith the abundance of other elements fixed at the solar values.\nIn the first model, we included two oxygen edge components. We treated the edge energies and the optical depths of the two 'edge' components as free parameters. We represented\nthe two O absorption lines with negative Gaussian functions. We fixed the centroid wavelengths to 23.505 \u00c5 and 23.360 \u00c5, and the widths to 0.04 \u00c5. The free parameters of the fits\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\nwere the two O edge energies and optical depths, the normalization factor and the power-law\nindex of the continuum, and the normalization factors of the two Gaussian absorption lines.\nWe show the results of the fits in the first data column of Table 2. The best fit energies\n+0.09\nof the two edges were 22.76+0.13\n\u22120.04 \u00c5 and 23.11\u22120.03 \u00c5, respectively. The former is consistent\nwith the atomic O edge of the spin 3/2 final state within the statistical error. On the other\nhand, the latter is in the middle of the atomic and the instrumental O absorption edges.\nThus, it is likely to represent an O edge of compound forms.\nNext, in order to investigate possible complex structures of the edges and the model\ndependence of the absorption optical depths, we increased the number of edge components\none by one. In the fits, we allowed both the energies and optical depths of all the edges to\nvary. In the second and third data columns of Table 2, the results are summarized. The\n\u03c72 value shows a significant improvement from the double to the three edge models (99.6 %\nconfidence with an F-test). The edge energy of the third edge is 22.58 \u00c5= 549.1 eV. This\nenergy is close to the edge energy for a final spin 1/2. In the raw spectrum (Figure 2), we\ncan find this edge structure. On the other hand, the \u03c72 value did not improve from the\nthree-edge to the four-edge models. Thus we conclude that the observed O edge structure\ncan be represented with the three-edge model within the limit of the present statistics and\nthe energy resolution; two of the edges represent absorption by atomic O corresponding to\nthe two different O-ion spin states, and the remaining one represents absorption by O in\ncompound forms.\nFinally, in order to determine the spectral parameters and their statistical errors for the\nthree-edge model more precisely, we performed the spectral fit with the three-edge model\nwith the two edge energies of the atomic O fixed at the theoretical values. In the last column\nof Table 2, we show the results. We estimated the statistical error for the total optical depth\nfor the atomic O edge from the \u03c72 contour map to find the total optical depth of 0.43 \u00b1 0.14.\nThe optical depth of compound forms is 0.26 \u00b1 0.11.\nTo estimate the column density of O from the absorption optical depth, we adopted\nthe absorption cross section of Verner & Yakovlev (1995): \u03c3abs = 4.98 \u00d7 10\u221219 cm2 both for\natomic and compound forms. We obtained NO,atom = 8.6 \u00b1 2.8 \u00d7 1017 cm\u22122 and NO,comp =\n5.2 \u00b1 2.2 \u00d7 1017 cm\u22122 .\n21\n21\nAssuming the NH values of 2.17+0.22\ncm\u22122 for atomic O and 2.87+0.25\ncm\u22122\n\u22120.20 \u00d7 10\n\u22120.23 \u00d7 10\nfor compound forms, we estimate the abundance of O to be 0.47 \u00b1 0.16 solar (atomic),\n0.21 \u00b1 0.09 solar (compound), and 0.68 \u00b1 0.13 solar (total), where we assumed the O solar\nabundance of 8.51 \u00d7 10\u22124 (Anders & Grevesse 1989). The error of the total abundance was\nestimated from the \u03c72 contour map of the spectral fit, taking into account the difference of\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\nNH values for gas and compound forms and their systematic errors.\n\n3.3.\n\nAbsorption structure of Ne\n\nIn the observed spectrum of Cyg X-2, we also clearly found an absorption edge at 14.3\n\u00c5, which is identified with the Ne K-edge (Figure 3). We performed spectral fits to the\nwavelength range of 12.0\u201315.5 \u00c5. In addition to the edge, there is an absorption line at 14.6\n\u00c5. Because the line wavelength is close to the edge, we included an absorption line in the\nmodel function. We employed the model function similar to that used for the O features.\nWe represented the Ne edge with a single edge model.\nIn Table 3, we show the results of the fit. The absorption edge wavelength was consistent\nwith that of the neutral Ne (14.25 \u00c5; Verner & Yakovlev 1995). From the optical depth\ndetermined from the fit and the theoretical absorption cross section of Ne I (Verner &\nYakovlev 1995), we determined the column density and abundance of Ne to be 2.00 \u00b1 0.51 \u00d7\n1017 cm\u22122 and 0.75 \u00b1 0.20 times the solar abundance of Anders & Grevesse (1989).\nAlthough the absorption-line energy, 14.599\u00b10.012 \u00c5, is close to the resonant line energy\nof Ne II (14.631 \u00c5, Behar & Netzer 2002), it is outside the 90% statistical error domain.\nThus we can not unequivocally identify this absorption line. However, if we assume it is\nNe II, the column density estimated from the line is 8.0 \u00b1 2.4 \u00d7 1016 cm\u22122 , which is about\n1/3 of Ne I. Thus if the absorption line is due to Ne II, Ne II can be attributed to the WIM.\n\n4.\n\nDiscussion\n\nWe have analyzed the O and Ne absorption structures in the X-ray spectrum of Cyg X-2\nobserved with the Chandra LETG/HRC-I. The O edge is represented by the sum of three\nedge components within the limit of present statistics and energy resolution. Two edge\ncomponents represent absorptions by atomic O; their edge energies are consistent with the\ntheoretical values corresponding to the two distinct final O states of different spin numbers.\nThe edge energy of the remaining edge is lower than the other two, and is likely to represent\nO in compound forms. From the depth of the edges, we estimated the O column densities\nwith atomic and compound forms separately.\nWe tried a four-edge component model in the spectral fits. We find the sum of the\noptical depths of all the edge components does not change significantly from three to four\nedge models. Thus we conclude that the total O column density does not depend significantly\non the number of edge components assumed in the spectral models. We estimated the atomic,\n\n\f\u2013 10 \u2013\ncompound, and total O abundances to be 0.47 \u00b1 0.16, 0.21 \u00b1 0.09, and 0.68 \u00b1 0.13 times\nthe solar abundance of Anders & Grevesse (1989) respectively. The Ne edge is represented\nwith a single edge model and the Ne abundance is estimated to be 0.75 \u00b1 0.20 solar. In the\nerrors of abundance quoted above, we included the statistical errors of the spectral fits, and\nthe systematic errors of NH estimated from the spatial fluctuation of 21cm and H\u03b1 emissions\nand the upper limit of CO emission.\nThere is an additional systematic error in the abundance of O in compound forms, arising\nfrom the uncertainty in the spatial distribution of the WIM. If we consider the extreme case\nin which its volume filling factor is 1, the O abundance reduces to 0.16 \u00b1 0.07 (compound\nform) and 0.63 \u00b1 0.12 (total).\nIt is very unlikely that the O and Ne absorption edges are associated with the circumstellar matter in the Cygnus X-2 binary system. Suppose that the absorption column of\nNH \u223c 2 \u00d7 1021 cm\u22122 is located in a distance r from the X-ray source. The ionization parameter, \u03be = LX /(nr 2 ) \u223c LX /(NH r) must be smaller than \u223c 10 so that O is neutral (Kallman &\nMcCray 1982). With LX = 1038 erg sec\u22121 , we find r & 1016 cm. This is much larger than the\nsize of the binary system (\u223c 1012 cm, Cowley, Crampton, & Hutchings 1979) This is consistent with the facts that all emission and absorption line features found in LMXBs are from\nhighly ionized atoms (e.g., Asai et al. 2000; Cottam et al. 2001) and that low-ionization emission lines from the Cyg X-2 system are from near the companion star (Cowley, Crampton,\n& Hutchings 1979).\nAbout one third of O contributing to the absorption edges is in compound form. Dust\ngrains are considered to contribute to this component. In such a situation, the optical depth\nfor dust scattering of X-rays is not negligible compared to the absorption if we assume\na typical dust radius of \u223c 0.1 \u03bcm. Scattered X-rays form an extended halo on the few\narcminute scale (Hayakawa 1970; Mauche & Gorenstein 1986; Predehl & Schmitt 1995).\nSince the scattering cross section is dependent on the X-ray energy, the energy spectrum of\nthe unscattered X-rays is modified by scattering. However, if multiple scattering is negligible\nand if the spatial distribution of dust is uniform over the spatial scale corresponding to the\ndust halo, the energy spectrum of total photons, i.e., the sum of the unscattered core and\nthe scattered halo, is not modified by dust scattering. This is not the case for the present\nenergy spectrum obtained with the LETG, since we derived the energy spectrum only from\nthe central \u223c 1 arc second of the X-ray image. Because the scattering cross sections show\nanomalous features around absorption edges (Mitsuda et al. 1990), the dust scattering will\naffect the estimation of the absorption column density; the scattering cross section is smaller\nat the energy just above the edge (at the wavelength shorter than the edge), while the\nabsorption cross section is larger. This leads to an underestimation of the O absorption\n\n\f\u2013 11 \u2013\ncolumn density. We estimated the amplitude of this effect in the following way.\nThe total scattering cross section of an X-ray photon of a wavelength \u03bb with a dust\ngrain of a radius a is given by\n2\n\n\u03c3dust,sc = 2\u03c0a\n\n\u0012\n\n2\u03c0a\n\u03bb\n\n\u00132\n\n2\n\nNr0 \u03bb2\n(f1 + if2 ) ,\n2\u03c0\n\nunder the Rayleigh-Gans approximation (van de Hulst 1957), where N is the number of\natoms per unit volume, r0 is the classical electron radius, and f1 and f2 are the atomic\nscattering factors (Henke, Gullikson, & Davis 1993). The Rayleigh-Gans approximation is\nvalid for (2\u03c0a/\u03bb)|Nr0 \u03bb2 /(2\u03c0)(f1 + if2 )| \u226a 1.\nBecause the factor |f1 + if2 | becomes small near the absorption edge, the dust scattering\ncross section is reduced at the edge. Assuming typical chemical compositions and densities\nof dust grains (FeSiO4 , FeSiO3 , Mg2 SiO4 and MgSiO3 ), we estimate the reduction of the\nscattering cross section at the O edge to be in the range,\n\u0012\n\u00134\na\n\u221210\n\u2206\u03c3dust,sc = (0.53 \u2212 0.93) \u00d7 10\ncm2 .\n0.1 \u03bcm\nAssuming the number density of dust to be proportional to \u221d a\u22123.5 with a cut off at amax\n(Mathis, Rumpl, & Nordsieck 1977), we calculate the reduction of the scattering cross section\nper O atom,\n\u0013\n\u0012\namax\n\u221219\ncm2 .\n\u2206\u03c3sc = (0.74 \u2212 1.44) \u00d7 10\n0.1 \u03bcm\nThus the reduction of scattering cross section can be a few tens of percent of the absorption\ncross section, \u03c3abs = 4.98 \u00d7 10\u221219 cm2 . The maximum grain radius contributing to X-ray\nscatterings has been estimated from the spatial size of dust scattering halos. Mauche &\nGorenstein (1986) and Mitsuda et al. (1990) suggested amax = 0.05 \u2212 0.1 \u03bcm, but recently\nWitt, Smith, & Dwek (2001) suggested the presence of grains with radii as large as 0.5\u03bcm.\nAdopting amax = 0.1 \u03bcm, and assuming that O of compound forms are all in dust grains,\nthe column density of O of compound forms increases from 5.2 \u00d7 1017 cm\u22122 to (6.1 \u2212 7.3) \u00d7\n1017 cm\u22122 . At the O edge energy, the Rayleigh-Gans approximation is valid only for amax .\n0.1 \u03bcm and the scattering cross section saturates at amax & 0.1 \u03bcm (Alcock & Hatchett 1978;\nSmith & Dwek 1998). Thus the correction factor does not increase for larger grains and the\ncorrection factor we applied above can be regarded as the maximum correction.\nThe O abundance values calculated for four different cases (with and without correction\nfor dust scattering, and two different values of the volume filling factor of the WIM) are\nsummarized in Table 4. The total O abundance is between 0.63 \u00b1 0.12 and 0.74 \u00b1 0.14 times\n\n\f\u2013 12 \u2013\nsolar. On the other hand the Ne abundance is 0.75 \u00b1 0.20. Our results are more consistent\nwith the recent solar abundances than the most widely used 'old' values. For example , the\nO and Ne solar abundances by Holweger (2001) are 0.65 and 0.81 times the values in Anders\n& Grevesse (1989), respectively.\nAnother important parameter we can estimate from the present X-ray observation is\n+5.1\nthe gas to dust ratio of the O column densities, which is estimated to be 2.2+3.9\n\u22121.1 , 2.8\u22121.5 ,\n+4.0\n1.7+3.0\n\u22120.9 , and 2.2\u22121.1 for cases 1 to 4 of Table 4, respectively. This should be compared with\nthe value estimated from the gas abundance from interstellar UV absorption lines and the\nassumption that the total abundance is solar. Adopting the O gas abundance of Cartledge,\nMeyer, & Lauroesch (2001) and solar abundances by Anders & Grevesse (1989) and Holweger\n(2001), we obtain 0.7 and 1.7, respectively. Our result is again consistent with the latest\nsolar abundance value.\nFor O, the present X-ray result contains an additional uncertainty due to the correction for dust scattering. We can avoid this if we include the spectrum from the scattering\nhalo in the analysis. This requires non-dispersive high resolution spectrometers such as\nmicrocalorimeters, which will be used on board future X-ray missions, such as Astro-E2.\nWe thank J. Ichimura and K.

The\nwhole wavelength range used in the spectral fits is shown in the lower graph, while in the\nupper graph the narrow wavelength range containing O edges and absorption lines is expanded. In the upper graph and in the upper panel of the lower graph, the observed 1st\norder spectrum is shown with data points with vertical bars which represent 1-\u03c3 statistical\nerrors. The best-fit model function of the three edge-component model (the last column of\nTable 2) convolved with the telescope and the detector response functions is shown with a\nthick line. The model function without O edges and absorption lines is shown with a thin\nline, in order to show the instrumental O absorption structure. Two absorption lines and an\nextended O edge clearly exist. In the lower panel of the lower graph, the residuals of the fit\nare shown\n\n\f\u2013 19 \u2013\n\nFig. 3.- Spectral fit in the wavelength range including the Ne absorption structures.
