We are interested in which,\nif either, of these descriptions of \u03c1ss as a stationary ensemble of pure states, is more natural. In\nthe preceding paper we concentrated upon the question of whether descriptions such as these are\nphysically realizable (PR). In this paper we investigate another relevant aspect of these ensembles,\ntheir robustness. A robust ensemble is one for which the pure states that comprise it survive\nrelatively unchanged for a long time under the system evolution. We determine numerically the\nmost robust ensembles as a function of the parameters in the laser model: the self-energy \u03c7 of the\nbosons in the laser mode, and the excess phase noise \u03bd. We find that these most robust ensembles\nare PR ensembles, or similar to PR ensembles, for all values of these parameters. In the ideal\nlaser limit (\u03bd = \u03c7 = 0), the most robust states are coherent states. As the phase noise or phase\ndispersion is increased through \u03bd or the self-interaction of the bosons \u03c7, respectively, the most\nrobust states become more and more amplitude-squeezed. We find scaling laws for these states,\nand give analytical derivations for them. As the phase diffusion or dispersion becomes so large that\nthe laser output is no longer quantum coherent, the most robust states become so squeezed that\nthey cease to have a well-defined coherent amplitude. That is, the quantum coherence of the laser\noutput is manifest in the most robust PR ensemble being an ensemble of states with a well-defined\ncoherent amplitude. This lends support to our approach of regarding robust PR ensembles as the\nmost natural description of the state of the laser mode. It also has interesting implications for atom\nlasers in particular, for which phase dispersion due to self-interactions is expected to be large.\n03.65.Yz, 03.75.Fi, 42.50.Lc, 03.65.Ta\n\nOn the basis of this second representation, one might\nclaim that the laser really is in a coherent state |\u03b1|ei\u03c6 ,\nbut that one cannot know a priori what the phase \u03c6 is.\nIn the preceding paper [3] we have investigated whether\nthis claim is true. If it were true then there should be\nsome way of finding out which coherent state the laser\nis in without affecting its dynamics. We found that if\nthere is any self-energy in the laser mode (such as a \u03c7(3)\nnonlinearity for an optical laser, or s-wave scattering for\nan atom laser), then it is in fact not possible to physically realize the coherent state ensemble in Eq. (1.2). By\ncontrast, it is always possible to physically realize the\nnumber state ensemble in Eq. (1.1).\n\nI. INTRODUCTION\n\nA laser is a device that produces a coherent beam of\nbosons. The meaning of the word 'coherent' in this context is discussed at length in a paper by one of us [1].\nIn particular, a coherent output does not mean that the\noutput, or the laser mode itself, is in a coherent state.\nRather, as has long been recognized [2], the stationary\nstate matrix for the laser mode is a mixture of number\nstates. In the far-above threshold limit, this mixture is\nPoissonian with mean \u03bc:\n\u03c1ss =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nn=0\n\ne\u2212\u03bc\n\n\u03bcn\n|ni hn| .\nn!\n\n(1.1)\n\nFor an ideal laser (with no \u03c7(3) -like nonlinearity), the\nunknown coherent state description and the unknown\nnumber state description are both physically realizable\n(PR). Given that they are mathematically equivalent,\nwhy is the former description ubiquitous and the latter\nrare? The answer, as was pointed out some time ago\nby Gea-Banacloche [4], is differential survival times. An\n\nThis state matrix can also be represented as a mixture\nof coherent states:\nZ\nd\u03c6\n\u03c1ss =\n|\u03b1|ei\u03c6 |\u03b1|ei\u03c6 ,\n(1.2)\n2\u03c0\nwhere |\u03b1|2 = \u03bc.\n\n\u2217\n\nElectronic address: h.wiseman@gu.edu.au\n\n1\n\n\flaser model. We concentrate upon continuous Markovian\nunravelings, which give ensembles of Gaussian states,\nand also consider unconstrained Gaussian ensembles. In\nSec. IV we present the numerical solutions for these equations, concentrating on the asymptotic behaviour in the\nlimit of large nonlinearity \u03c7 and phase noise \u03bd. The concluding Sec. V is a discussion of our results and their\nrelation to atom laser coherence, and some suggestions\nfor future work.\n\nideal laser prepared in a coherent state will remain close\nto that initial state for a time of order \u03ba\u22121 , where \u03ba is\nthe bare decay rate of the cavity. By contrast, a laser\nprepared in a number state will be likely to remain in\nthat state only for a time of order \u03ba\u22121 /\u03bc, where \u03bc is the\nmean number as above.\nThis result, derived also in Ref. [5], was taken further by Gea-Banacloche in Ref. [6] using the early model\nfor a laser with saturation due to Scully and Lamb [2].\nGea-Banacloche considered pure states with mean photon number equal to that of the laser at steady state, and\ncalculated their purity at later times. He showed that the\npure state that had the slowest initial rate of decay of purity was, in general, a slightly amplitude-squeezed state\nrather than a coherent state.\nThere seems little doubt, then, that it is most useful\nto consider an ideal laser to be in a coherent state (or\nnearly coherent state) of unknown phase. However it is\nan open question whether this is true of a non-ideal laser,\nthat is, a laser with additional noise or dispersion of some\nform. Another open question is how this issue relates to\nthe quantum coherence of the output of such a non-ideal\ndevice.\nThe particular laser system of interest here is the atom\nlaser [1]. An important difference between an atom laser\nand an optical laser is that the interatomic interactions\ncannot be neglected. This gives rise to a \u03c7(3) -like nonlinearity in the laser mode. As noted above, this affects the\nphysical realizability of ensembles, and we also expect it\nto affect their robustness.\nA robustness analysis for a Bose-Einstein condensate\nhas been done by one of us with Barnett and Burnett [7].\nThis produced similar results to that of Gea-Banacloche\n[6], although it was based on the fidelity [8] which measures the overlap of the initial state with the state at a\nlater time. However, the authors of Ref. [7] only calculated the initial rate of decay of the fidelity, and this is\nunaffected by any Hamiltonian terms. Hence the self energy played no role in this analysis. Moreover, the treatment, like that of Gea-Banacloche [6], considered only a\nsingle pure state to represent the state of the condensate.\nThus it does not give, in general, a representation of the\nsteady state on par with Eq. (1.1) or Eq. (1.2).\nIn this paper we give an analysis that treats the dynamics of an atom laser at all times and that incorporates\nan ensemble of pure states. It takes into account Hamiltonian terms and gives a robust representation of the\nsteady state. We consider both the problem of finding\nthe most robust ensemble, and the most robust physically realizable (PR) ensemble. Since ensembles are realized by unraveling the master equation [9,3], finding\nthe most robust PR ensemble is equivalent to finding the\nmaximally robust unraveling, a concept introduced by us\nin Ref. [9].\nA review of maximally robust unravelings, including a\ncomparison with other approaches, is given in Sec. II.\nIn Sec. III we present the equations for determining\nthe maximally robust unraveling (MRU) for an atom\n\nII. MAXIMALLY ROBUST UNRAVELINGS\n\nA. Comparison with Other Approaches\n\nThe idea of robustness has it origins in studies of decoherence and the classical limit [4\u20137,10\u201315]. Decoherence\nis the process by which an open quantum system becomes entangled with its environment, thereby causing\nits state to become mixed. However, not all pure states\ndecohere with equal rapidity. In particular, Zurek [10] defined the \"preferred states\" of open quantum systems as\nthose states that remain relatively pure for a long time.\nThis idea can be thought of as a \"predictability sieve\"\n[11]. That is, the preferred states are those for which\nthe future dynamics are predictable, in the sense that\nthere is some projective question (is the system in some\nparticular state?) that is likely to give the result \"yes\".\nOur approach, as introduced in Ref. [9] and applied\nto resonance fluorescence by one of us and Brady [16], is\nto find the maximally robust unraveling. This approach\nshares some similarities with other approaches. It has,\nhowever, a suite of four distinctive characteristics which\nwe enumerate below.\n\n1. Ensembles of Pure States\n\nFirst, we considered not a single pure state, but an ensemble of pure states. This is appropriate for situations\nwhere the open system comes to a mixed equilibrium\nstate. The ensemble of pure states that we consider must\nbe a representation of that equilibrium mixed state. That\nis, the system has a certain probability of being in one\nof those pure states, as in Eqs. (1.1) and (1.2). Recently,\nDi\u00f3si and Kiefer [14] have also considered ensembles of\npure states in a similar context.\nWithout considering such an ensemble it is necessary\nto put some ad-hoc restriction on the pure states considered so that they have some relevance to the actual state\nthe system is in at equilibrium. For example, as noted\nabove, Gea-Banacloche [6] considered only pure states\nhaving the same mean photon number as the equilibrium\nstate of the laser model under consideration.\n2\n\n\fthe purity, and hence is independent of any Hamiltonian\nterms. It is only by considering the robustness over some\nfinite time that the Hamiltonian terms will contribute.\n\n2. Physical Realizability\n\nSecond, in Ref. [9] we placed a restriction on the ensembles of pure states that we consider: they must be\nphysically realizable. By this we mean that it should be\npossible, without altering the evolution of the system, to\nknow that its state at equilibrium is definitely one of the\npure states in the ensemble, but which pure state cannot\nbe predicted beforehand. Di\u00f3si and Kiefer [14] have considered a similar condition, although they do not make\nthe connection with physical realizability and measurement. In this paper we also consider ensembles without\nthe constraint of physical realizability, as it is of interest\nto see how active that constraint is.\nWe have considered in detail the issue of physical realizability of ensembles of pure states in the preceding\npaper [3]. Here we merely remind the reader of some\nkey points and terminology. An ensemble for a system\nobeying a Markovian master equation is physically realized by monitoring the baths to which it is coupled. This\nleads to an unraveling [17] of the master equation into a\nstochastic equation for a pure state. In steady, state, the\npure state will move ergodically within some (perhaps infinite) ensemble of pure states. This is how an unraveling\ndefines an ensemble, with the weighting of each member\nbeing the proportion of time the system spends with that\nstate.\n\nB. Unraveling the Master Equation\n\nIn this section, we briefly reiterate the discussion in\nRef. [3] on how the master equation is unraveled to yield\na pure state ensemble. The most general form of the\nMarkovian master equation is [18]\n\u03c1\u0307 = \u2212i[H, \u03c1] +\n\nK\nX\n\nk=1\n\nD[ck ]\u03c1 \u2261 L\u03c1,\n\n(2.1)\n\nwhere for arbitrary operators A and B,\nD[A]B \u2261 ABA\u2020 \u2212 {A\u2020 A, B}/2.\n\n(2.2)\n\nWe assume this to have a unique stationary state \u03c1ss . It\ncan be represented in terms of pure states as\nX\n\u03c1ss =\n\u2118n Pn ,\n(2.3)\nn\n\nwhere the Pn are projection operators and the \u2118n are\npositive weights summing to unity. The (possibly infinite) set of ordered pairs,\nE = {(Pn , \u2118n ) : n = 1, 2, . . .},\n\n3. Survival Probability\n\n(2.4)\n\nwe will call an ensemble E of pure states. There are continuously infinitely many ensembles E that represent \u03c1ss .\nOur aim is to find the 'best' or 'most natural' representation for \u03c1ss .\nOur first requirement is that the ensemble be physically realizable. This is possible if the environment of\nthe system is monitored, leading to a stochastic quantum trajectory for the system state. Assuming that the\ninitial state of the system is pure, the quantum trajectory for its projector will be described by the stochastic\nmaster equation (SME)\n\nThird, in Ref. [9] we defined robustness in terms of the\nfidelity or survival probability of the pure states rather\nthan their purity. That is, we consider how close the\nstates remain to their original state under the master\nequation evolution, rather than just how close they remain to a pure state. This means that Hamiltonian evolution alone can affect the robustness of states (whereas\nit does not affect their purity, except in conjunction with\nthe irreversible terms). It might be thought that this is\nan undesirable feature. However, as will be shown, using\nthe survival probability gives results that accord with the\nusual concept of coherence in lasers. This contrasts with\nthe results that are obtained using purity, which we also\nconsider at the end of this paper (Sec. V C)\n\ndP = dt [L + U(t)] P.\n\n(2.5)\n\nHere the superoperator U, which we will call an unraveling, does not affect the average evolution of the system,\nbut preserves the idempotency of P . In the long-time\nlimit the system will be in some pure state Pn , with some\nprobability \u2118n such that Eq. (2.3) is satisfied. Since the\nstates and weights will depend on the unraveling U, we\ndenote the resultant stationary ensemble by\n\n4. Survival Time\n\nThe final aspect of our work that differs from most\nprevious approaches [6,12\u201314] is that we quantify the robustness by the survival time. (This time was previously\ncalled the fidelity time in Ref [7]). It is the time taken\nfor the survival probability to fall below some predefined\nthreshold. This is as opposed to considering the rate of\ndecay of the survival probability at the initial time. That\nrate is actually identical to half the initial rate of decay of\n\nE U = {(PnU , \u2118U\nn ) : n = 1, 2, . . .}.\n\n(2.6)\n\nFor practical reasons explained in [3], we restrict our\ninvestigation of the (atom) laser to continuous Markovian\nunravelings (CMUs). As was shown in [3], under a linearization of the dynamics these lead to Gaussian pure\n3\n\n\fstates as the members of the ensembles E U . As mentioned above, we will also consider ensembles, in particular Gaussian ensembles, which are not constrained by\nthe requirement of physical realizability. This is in order\nto see the importance of this requirement in constraining\nthe most natural ensembles.\n\n2. Comparison with Purity\n\nAs noted in Sec. II A 3 above, it is more common in\ndiscussions of robustness to use purity rather than survival probability. The purity of a state at time t can be\nquantified as\nLt U\npU\nn (t) = Tr[ e Pn\n\nC. Quantifying the Robustness\n\nImagine that the system has been evolving under a\nparticular unraveling U from an initial state at time \u2212\u221e\nto the stationary ensemble at the present time 0. It will\nthen be in the state PnU with probability \u2118U\nn . If we now\ncease to monitor the system then the state will no longer\nremain pure, but rather will relax toward \u03c1ss under the\nevolution of Eq. (2.1).\nThis relaxation to equilibrium will occur at different\nrates for different states. For example, some unravelings\nwill tend to collapse the system at t = 0 into a pure state\nthat is very fragile, in that the system will not remain in\nthat state for very long. In this case the ensemble would\nrapidly become a poor representation of the observer's\ncurrent knowledge about the system. Hence we can say\nthat such an ensemble is a 'bad' or 'unnatural' representation of \u03c1. Conversely, an unraveling that produces\nrobust states would remain an accurate description for a\nrelatively long time. We expect such a 'good' or 'natural' ensemble to give more intuition about the dynamics\nof the system. The most robust ensemble we interpret as\nthe 'best' or 'most natural' such ensemble.\nIn most of this paper we quantify the robustness of\na particular state PnU by its survival probability SnU (t).\nThis is the probability that the system would be found\n(by a hypothetical projective measurement) to be still in\nthe state PnU at time t. It is given by [19]\n\n\u0001\nLt U\np\u0303U\nn (t) = maxP\u0303n (t) Tr[P\u0303n (t) e Pn ].\n\nX\n\nU\n\u2118U\nn Sn (t).\n\n(2.7)\n\n(2.8)\n\nn\n\nIn the limit t \u2192 \u221e the ensemble-averaged survival probability will tend towards the stationary value\nS U (\u221e) = Tr[\u03c12ss ].\n\n(2.10)\n\n(2.11)\n\nFor Gaussian states (see Sec. III) these quantities are\nU\nsimply related by p\u0303U\nn (t) = 2/[1 + 1/pn (t)].\nThe survival probability has a number of advantages\nover purity. First, we motivated our robustness criterion\nfrom the desire for E U to remain a good description of\nthe system once the unraveling ceases. That is, we wish\nto be able to usefully regard the members of the ensemble\nE U as the states the system is \"really\" in at steady state.\nThis is better quantified by the survival probability because the purity effectively takes into account only how\nclose the state eLt Pn remains to some pure state P\u0303n (t)\n[introduced in Eq. (2.11)], not how close it remains to\nthe original state Pn . An ensemble constructed by considering the purity would thus, in general, only remain a\ngood description of the system by including the deterministic (but not necessarily unitary) evolution of its members from Pn to P\u0303n (t) after the unraveling ceases. This\ntime evolution would negate the idea that the ensemble\nof states Pn is the best representation of the system at\nsteady state.\nAnother reason for preferring the survival probability\ncomes from imagining that the unraveling U continues\nafter t = 0. In that case one can calculate a conditional\nsurvival probability, being the overlap of the pure conditional state with the pure initial state. The ensemble\naverage of this conditional survival probability is simply the survival probability SnU (t) defined in Eq. (2.7)\nabove. Thus the concept of survival probability still applies even for the conditional evolution. By contrast, the\nconditional purity of the unraveled state would always be\nunity, and consequently has no relation to the unconditional purity defined in Eq. (2.10). The latter thus has\nno simple interpretation for the unraveled evolution.\nThe final reason for preferring survival probability, already noted in Sec. II A 3, is that it yields results for the\natom laser that have a clear and simple physical interpretation in terms of the coherence of the laser output.\nWe will show that this is so in the Discussion section.\nOne limit in which quite different results are to be expected from using purity rather than survival probability\nis that in which the Hamiltonian part of the dynamics\n\nSince we are considering an ensemble E U we must define the average survival probability\nS U (t) =\n\n].\n\nThe ensemble average of this quantity is also initially\nunity, and approaches Tr[\u03c12ss ] as t \u2192 \u221e. Alternatively,\nthe purity could be quantified as the maximum overlap\nof any pure state P\u0303n (t) with the evolved mixed state:\n\n1. Survival Probability\n\nSnU (t) = Tr[PnU eLt PnU ].\n\n\u00012\n\n(2.9)\n\nThis is independent of the unraveling U and is a measure\nof the mixedness of \u03c1ss .\n\n4\n\n\f\u039b = lim (Tr[\u03c1nss ])1/n\n\ndominates. As will be shown, this limit is highly relevant\nfor the atom laser.\nFormally, we split the Liouvillian superoperator L as\nL = Lirr + \u03c7Lrev ,\n\n= max{\u03bbj \u2208 IR : \u03c1ss Qj = \u03bbj Qj , Qj = Q2j }.\n\nK\nX\n\nk=1\n\nD[ck ]\u03c1.\n\nLrev \u03c1 = \u2212i[H, \u03c1].\n\n(2.13)\n\nj=2\n\n2\n\n<\u039b +\n\n(2.14)\n\n(2.16)\n(2.17)\n\n(2.18)\n(2.19)\n\nThe Hamiltonian term directly affects the survival probability, but it affects the purity only in combination with\nthe irreversible term.\n\nJM = {R \u2208 J : \u03c4 R \u2265 \u03c4 U \u2200 U \u2208 J}.\n\n3. Survival Time\n\n(2.20)\n\nThe ensemble survival time for a particular unraveling\nwould then be defined as\n\u03c4 U = min{t : S U (t) = \u039b}.\n\n(2.26)\n\n(2.27)\n\nAs noted above, in practice it may be necessary to restrict\nthe analysis to continuous Markovian unravelings D, and\nthe corresponding subset DM . Even if JM has many elements R1 , R2 , * * *, these different unravelings may give\nthe same ensemble E R = E R1 = E R2 = * * *. In this case\nE R is the most natural ensemble representation of the\nstationary solution of the given master equation. When\nwe consider ensembles that are not constrained by the\ncondition of physical realizability, we will denote the most\nrobust of these by E R . That is, we reserve the calligraphic R to denote a robust unraveling.\n\nThe above analysis shows that the difference between\npurity and survival probability only shows up at finite\ntimes. Thus the best way to characterize robustness is\nto look not at the initial rate of decay of the survival\nprobability, but at the time it takes to fall below some\nthreshold value \u039b satisfying\n1 > \u039b > Tr[\u03c12ss ].\n\n(2.25)\n\nHere the strict inequality holds unless all eigenvalues of\n\u03c1ss are equal.\nIn the absence of any monitoring of the bath, the projector Q1 would be one's best guess for what pure state\nthe system is in at steady state. The chance of this guess\nbeing correct is simply \u039b, which is obviously independent\nof time t. Using this \u039b, the survival time \u03c4 U could thus\nbe interpreted as the time at which the initial state PnU\nceases (on average) to be any better than Q1 as an estimate of which pure state is occupied. In other words, the\nensemble E U is obsolete at time \u03c4 U .\nIn this paper we do not use this choice for \u039b, for reasons to be explained later. This brings a certain degree\nof arbitrariness into the analysis. However, as we show,\nthe most important and interesting results we obtain are\nindependent of the choice of \u039b.\nHaving chosen a particular value for \u039b, the survival\ntime \u03c4 U quantifies the robustness of an unraveling U.\nLet the set of all unravelings be denoted J. Then the\nsubset of maximally robust unravelings JM is\n\n(2.15)\n\nFor longer times, both expressions will (in general) be\ndominated in the large-\u03c7 regime by the reversible term,\nbut in different ways:\nS(t) \u2243 1 + \u03c72 (t2 /2)Tr[P L2rev P ],\np(t) \u2243 1 + \u03c7t2 Tr[P (Lirr Lrev \u2212 Lrev Lirr )P ].\n\n\u039b\u03bbj\n\n= \u039b2 + \u039b(1 \u2212 \u039b) = \u039b.\n\nand so Tr[ALrev A] = 0, for arbitrary operators A and B.\nTo first order in time, both the survival probability\nand the purity depend only upon the irreversible term:\nS(t) = 1 + tTr[P Lirr P ],\np(t) = 1 + 2tTr[P Lirr P ].\n\nX\nj=2\n\nThe reversibility of Lrev implies that\nTr[ALrev B] = \u2212Tr[BLrev A]\n\n(2.23)\n\nThis can be shown to satisfy \u039b > Tr[\u03c12ss ] as follows. Let\nthe eigenvalues of \u03c1ss be ordered such that \u039b = \u03bb1 \u2265\n\u03bb2 \u2265 \u03bb3 . . .. Then\nX\n\u03bb2j\n(2.24)\nTr[\u03c12ss ] = \u039b2 +\n\n(2.12)\n\nwhere \u03c7 is a large parameter and\nLirr \u03c1 =\n\n(2.22)\n\nn\u2192\u221e\n\nIII. MRUS FOR THE (ATOM) LASER\n\n(2.21)\n\nA. The Master Equation\n\nNote that this time is the first time for which S U (t) = \u039b.\nThe survival probability is not necessarily monotonically\ndecreasing and in some simple examples there will be\nmany solutions to the equation S U (t) = \u039b [16].\nA natural choice of \u039b, suggested in Ref. [9], is the maximum eigenvalue of \u03c1ss :\n\nThe master equation we use for the (atom) laser is the\nsame as that in the preceding paper [3]. In the interaction picture, and measuring time in units of the output\ndecay rate, it is\n5\n\n\f\u0001\n\u03c1\u0307 = \u03bcD[a\u2020 ]A[a\u2020 ]\u22121 + D[a] + N D[a\u2020 a] \u03c1\n\u2020\n\n2\n\n\u2212 iC[(a a) , \u03c1].\n\nnumbers, \u03bc11 , \u03bc20 , which play the role of U in Eq. (2.6).\nWe do not need \u03bc02 because the purity of the unraveled\nstates implies that\n\n(3.1)\n\nThe parameters N and C represent excess phase noise\nand self-interaction energy respectively. This has the stationary solution expressed in Eqs. (1.1) and (1.2), with\nmean boson number \u03bc.\nTo make progress on this equation we linearized it\naround a mean field by making the replacement\n\u221a\n(3.2)\na = \u03bc + (x + iy)/2,\n\n\u03bc20 \u03bc02 \u2212 \u03bc211 = 1.\n\nHowever, it should be noted that the mapping from U to\n\u03bc11 , \u03bc20 is, in general, many-to-one.\nThe ensemble can thus be represented as\nU\nE U = {(Px\u0304,\u0233\n, \u2118U\nx\u0304,\u0233 ) : x\u0304, \u0233},\n\n(3.3)\n\n\u03bc10 (t) = \u03bc10 (0)w,\n\u03bc01 (t) = \u03bc01 (0) \u2212 \u03c7\u03bc10 (0)(1 \u2212 w),\n\u03bc20 (t) = \u03bc20 (0)w2 + 1 \u2212 w2 ,\n\u03bc11 (t) = \u03bc11 (0)w \u2212 \u03c7 {1 + w[\u03bc20 (0) \u2212 2]\n+ w2 [1 \u2212 \u03bc20 (0)] ,\n\u03bc02 (t) = \u03bc02 (0) + (2 + \u03bd)t \u2212 2\u03c7\u03bc11 (0)(1 \u2212 w)\n+ 2\u03c72 {t + [\u03bc20 (0) \u2212 2](1 \u2212 w)\n+ [1 \u2212 \u03bc20 (0)](1 \u2212 w2 )/2 ,\n\n(3.4)\n(3.5)\n(3.6)\n\ngiven by\n\n(3.14)\n\nIt is convenient to use a new notation for the second\norder moments,\n\u03bc02\n,\n\u03bc20 \u03bc02 \u2212 \u03bc211\n\u03bc11\n,\n\u03b2=\n\u03bc20 \u03bc02 \u2212 \u03bc211\n\u03bc20\n.\n\u03b3=\n\u03bc20 \u03bc02 \u2212 \u03bc211\n\n(3.7)\n\n\u03b1=\n\n(3.8)\n\n\u2212t\n\nwhere w \u2261 e , \u03c7 = 4\u03bcC and \u03bd = 4\u03bcN .

Survival Probability\n\nWe are interested in the survival probability of the\nU\nstates Px\u0304,\u0233\n. It is convenient to consider the correspondU\ning Wigner functions, Wx\u0304,\u0233\n(x, y). Obviously the survival\nprobability is independent of \u0233 so we will drop this subscript, and set \u0233 = 0 for ease of calculation. For Gaussian\nstates the Wigner function is a bivariate Gaussian distribution with the moments \u03bcmn defined above. The state\nwith initial moments \u03bcmn (0) will evolve into a state with\nmoments \u03bcmn (t) given by (3.4\u20133.8). We will denote the\nWigner function for the former state Wx\u0304 (x, y, 0) and that\nfor the latter Wx\u0304 (x, y, t). The survival probability of the\nstate Px\u0304U is given by [20]\n\nB. The Unraveled Master Equation\n\nUnder a continuous Markovian unraveling the longtime solutions for the linearized stochastic dynamics are\nstill Gaussian [3]. In fact, the evolution of the second\norder moments \u03bc20 , \u03bc02 , \u03bc11 is deterministic. This means\nthat for a given unraveling U the stationary ensemble\nwill consist of Gaussian pure states all having the same\nsecond order moments. They are distinguished only by\ntheir first order moments x\u0304 = \u03bc10 , \u0233 = \u03bc01 , which therefore take the role of the index n in Eq. (2.6).

As will be shown, the most\nrobust ensemble, (that with the largest survival time) is\nsubstantially independent of \u039b. Unless otherwise stated\nwe choose \u039b to be the midpoint of the two bounds in\nEq. (3.27), namely\n\nwhere \u039b is a constant satisfying\n1 > \u039b > Tr[\u03c12ss ].\n\n(3.27)\n\nFrom the solution (1.1) of the nonlinear dynamics, the\nlower bound on \u039b is, for \u03bc \u226b 1,\nTr[\u03c12ss ] = (4\u03c0\u03bc)\u22121/2 .\n\n(3.29)\n\nFrom these expressions it is evident that there would\nbe a problem in choosing Eq. (3.29) for \u039b: it is very close\nto the value for Tr[\u03c12ss ] = (4\u03c0\u03bc)\u22121/2 . This means that\nthe survival time would be equal to the time by which\nthe system has relaxed almost to the equilibrium mixed\nstate. In particular, its phase would necessarily be poorly\ndefined by this time, which means that the linearization\nof the dynamics that we have been using would not be\nvalid.\nIf instead we start with the solution (3.9) of the linearized dynamics, we have an even worse situation:\np\nTr[\u03c12ss ] = lim n Tr[\u03c1nss ] = 0.\n(3.30)\n\nD. The Survival Time\n\nS U (\u03c4 U ) = \u039b,\n\np\nn\nTr[\u03c1nss ] = (2\u03c0\u03bc)\u22121/2 .\n\n(3.25)\n\n(3.28)\n\nIn the same limit, the largest eigenvalue for \u03c1ss is\n7\n\n\f\u039b = 1/2.\n\n(3.31)\n\nThe second case in Fig. 1(b) is again for an initial\ncoherent state but with \u03bd = 0, \u03c7 = 50, plotted for\nt = 0, 0.0678, 0.2. Again the middle time is the survival\ntime for the coherent state. Note that it is almost two\norders of magnitude smaller than the coherent state survival time for \u03c7 = 0. The effect of the large \u03c7 is to rapidly\n2\nshear the state. This is because the a\u2020 a2 nonlinearity\namounts to an intensity-dependent frequency shift. The\ncoherent state ensemble E |\u03b1i , however, is not the most\nrobust ensemble for \u03c7 = 50.\nThe third case in Fig. 1(c) is the most robust unconstrained ensemble E R for \u03bd = 0, \u03c7 = 50, as determined\nby the numerical p\nmethod discussed in Sec. III. Three\nmembers, x\u0304 = 0, \u00b1 3/2, of this ensemble are displayed.\nNote that the t = 0 state is a highly amplitude-squeezed\nstate. In fact it is not purely amplitude-squeezed; the\nx-y-covariance \u03b2 R = \u03bc11 is equal to 0.225. In general,\nthe angle \u03b8 between the major axis of the ellipse and the\ny-axis is\n\nE. Unconstrained Gaussian Ensembles\n\nFinding the most robust PR ensemble E R consists of\na searching for the maximum \u03c4 in the region of \u03b2-\u03b3 space\nallowed by the PR constraint. To determine how important this constraint is in determining E R , we also search\nfor the maximum \u03c4 in all of \u03b2-\u03b3 space (subject only to\n0 < \u03b3 \u2264 1). The ensemble picked out by this search we\nwill call the most robust unconstrained ensemble and denote E R . Although we call in unconstrained, it is in fact\nconstrained to be of the same form as the ensembles resulting from a continuous Markovian unravelings. That\nis, it consists of Gaussian states with identical secondorder moments distinguished only by their mean amplitude and phase.\n\n\u03b8=\n\nIV. RESULTS\n\n1\n2\u03b2\n1\n2\u03b2\u03b3\n.\narctan\n= arctan\n2\n\u03b1\u2212\u03b3\n2\n1 + \u03b22 \u2212 \u03b32\n\n(4.1)\n\nIn the limit of small \u03b3 and \u03b2 this becomes \u03b8 \u2243 \u03b2\u03b3. In this\ncase, with \u03b3 R = 0.100, we have \u03b8R = 1.2\u25e6 . This angle\nof rotation is almost too small to make out in the figure.\nIt is nevertheless interesting that this slight rotation persists for all \u03c7 > 0, and that it is actually in the opposite\ndirection to the rotation caused by the shearing. That is,\nas the most robust state evolves it passes through a point\nwhere the squeezing is purely in the amplitude. Because\nthe x-variance \u03b3 R of the states in this ensemble E R is\nless than unity, the different members of E R have different values of x\u0304. The\np three initial states we show, with\nx\u0304 = 0 and x\u0304 = \u00b1 3/2, are typical members of the ensemble. The states into which these members of the most\nrobust ensemble evolve are plotted for t = 0.100 = \u03c4 R\n(the survival time) and t = 0.2 [as in Fig. 1(b)]. Note\nthat the survival time is significantly larger that that for\nthe coherent state ensemble in Fig. 1(b).\nThe final plot, Fig. 1(d), shows typical members of\nthe most robust PR ensemble E R . That is, the most\nrobust ensemble that can be realized by unraveling the\nmaster equation. It is very similar to the most robust\nunconstrained ensemble E R , also being highly amplitude\nsqueezed with \u03b3 R = 0.092. The three times at which\nits evolution is plotted are t = 0, t = 0.098 = \u03c4 R , and\nt = 0.2 [as in Figs. 1(b) and 1(c)]. Note that the survival time \u03c4 R is marginally smaller than that for the unconstrained ensemble, \u03c4 R . The principal difference from\nFig. 1(c) is that the x-y-covariance has the opposite sign,\nwith \u03b2 R = \u22120.092. This corresponds to a rotation of\n\u03b8R = \u22120.48\u25e6 , a rotation that is accentuated as the evolution progresses. Again, the initial rotation is almost too\nsmall to see in the figure, but it is a persistent feature for\nlarge \u03c7.\nFrom Fig. 1 it is evident that the evolved states from\nthe initial state with x\u0304 = 0 in the robust cases (c) at\n\nA. Varying \u03c7 with \u03bd = 0\n\nFirst we present the results for no excess phase noise\n(\u03bd = 0) to see the effect of varying the self-energy parameter \u03c7. Because our results are numerical, we present\nthem mostly in a graphical form.\n\n1. Evolution at \u03c7 = 0 and \u03c7 = 50\n\nFig. 1 shows the evolution of various initially pure\nGaussian quantum states under the linearized evolution\nof Eqs. (3.4)\u2013(3.8). We represent these states by the onestandard-deviation ellipses of the Wigner function. In\neach case we choose the initial mean location of the state\nin phase space to be x\u0304p= \u0233 = 0, and, for the last two\ncases, for \u0233 = 0, x\u0304 = \u00b1 3/2 as well.\nThe first case in Fig. 1(a) is for \u03bd = 0, \u03c7 = 0, and\nan initial coherent state. The ellipses are plotted for\nt = 0, 3, 10. The middle time is the ensemble-averaged\nsurvival time for an ensemble of coherent states; that is,\nthe time at which the ensemble-averaged survival probability S(t) drops to 1/2. For the particular case of the coherent state there is no distinction between the ensembleaveraged survival probability and the survival probability of a single coherent state Sx\u0304 (t). That is because the\nx-variance \u03b3 of a coherent state is equal to unity, the\nensemble-averaged x-variance, so that perforce x\u0304 = 0.\nNote that the only dynamics in evidence here is phase\ndiffusion, causing the y-variance of the state to increase.\nFor \u03c7 = \u03bd = 0, the coherent state ensemble is in fact the\nmost robust ensemble. This can be verified analytically.\nIt is also physically realizable, as shown in the preceding\npaper [3].\n8\n\n\fsurvival time \u03c4 |\u03b1i for an ensemble consisting of coherent\nstates.\nFor values of \u03c7 less than about 7.7, the members of\nthe most robust unconstrained ensemble are close to coherent states, with \u03b1R \u2248 \u03b3 R = 1 and \u03b2 R <\n\u223c 1. As noted\nabove, the states are sheared in the opposite direction to\nthe shearing produced by \u03c7. At \u03c7 \u2248 7.7 there is a discontinuity in all state parameters. Below this value the\nmaximum survival time \u03c4 lies on the boundary \u03b3 = 1.\nAbove this value, what was previously a local maximum\nat some point \u03b3 < 1 becomes a global maximum, hence\nthe jump in the parameters. This is shown by the contour\nplots of \u03c4 versus \u03b3 and \u03b2 in Fig. 4.\nAs \u03c7 becomes large, all of the curves plotted in Fig. 3\ntend to straight lines on the log-log plot. It is thus an\neasy matter to read off the following power laws from the\ngradients of these lines:\n\nt = 0.100 and (d) at t = 0.098 are much closer to the initial state than the evolved state in the coherent case (b)\nis at time t = 0.0678. This is despite the fact that all of\nthese times are the respective survival times at which the\nsurvival probability drops to 1/2. However,\np the evolved\nstates from the initial states with x\u0304 = \u00b1 3/2 in cases\n(c) and (d) have a lower overlap with their initial states\nthan does the evolved coherent state of case (b). This\nclearly illustrates that the survival probability is necessarily a property of the whole ensemble of states, not of\na single member. Figure 1 also shows that the survival\nprobability decays for different reasons in different cases.\nIn case (a) it decays because the evolved state becomes\nmore mixed, due to phase diffusion. In case (b) it decays primarily because the evolved state changes shape\n(shearing) while remaining relatively pure. In cases (c)\nand (d) it decays substantially because the mean position\nof the evolved state moves away from that of the initial\nstates in phase space. In Fig. 2 we compare the ensembleaveraged survival probability S(t) for the four cases in\nFig. 1. Note that the time scale for case (a) (\u03c7 = 0)\ndiffers from that used for cases (b), (c) and (d) (\u03c7 = 50).\nFor short times the survival probability for the coherent state ensemble E |\u03b1i (b) is greater than the survival\nprobability for the most robust ensembles E R (c) and E R\n(d). Indeed, the gradient of the survival probability for\nthe coherent state ensemble at t = 0 is much less than\nthat of the most robust ensembles. This underlines the\nimportance of the survival time, rather than the initial\nrate of decay of survival probability, to quantify robustness. At short times the survival probability generally decays linearly, due to irreversible processes, as discussed\nin Sec. II C 2. A coherent state minimizes this form of\ndecoherence, resulting in an almost quadratic behaviour\n\u22121\nof S |\u03b1i (t) for t <\n\u223c \u03c7 = 0.02. This can be understood\nfrom the asymptotic analytical expression in Eq. (2.18)\nfor the survival probability for a master equation with a\nlarge reversible term. This expression only applies for the\nsurvival probability of a single state, but is applicable to\na coherent state ensemble because all members are effectively identical. It need not, and indeed does not, apply\nto the more robust ensembles. In comparison with the\ncoherent state ensemble, the most robust ensembles are\naffected more by irreversible evolution at short times but\nless by the interplay of reversible and irreversible terms\nat longer times.\n\n\u03b1R \u223c \u03c72/3 ,\n\u03c4\n\nR\n\n(4.2)\n\n\u03b2 R \u223c \u03c7\u22121/3 ,\nR\n\n\u2243\u03b3 \u223c\u03c7\n\n\u22122/3\n\n.\n\n(4.3)\n(4.4)\n\nThese results clearly show that as \u03c7 increases, the most\nrobust states become increasingly amplitude-squeezed.\nFrom Eq. (4.1) the scaling law for the rotation angle of\nthe squeezed state is\n\u03b8R \u223c \u03c7\u22121 .\n\n(4.5)\n\nThese scalings with \u03c7 can be understood by considering the causes of the decay in the survival probability from the equations (3.4)\u2013(3.8). A typical highly\namplitude-squeezed state member of the most robust ensemble has a mean amplitude-quadrature fluctuation x\u0304 of\norder unity. From Eq. (3.5), the mean y-quadrature will\ntherefore change in a time t \u226a 1 by an amount of order\n\u03c7t. This will result in the significant decay of the survival\nprobability if the change \u03c7t is of order the standard deviation \u03b11/2 of the y-quadrature for that squeezed state;\nin other words, if t = \u03c4 where\n\u03c4 \u223c \u03b11/2 \u03c7\u22121 .\n\n(4.6)\n\nThis reduction in overlap due to the motion of the mean\nphase of the states is clearly p\nillustrated in Fig. 1(c) for\nthe initial states with x\u0304 = \u00b1 3/2. The survival probability will also be affected by an increase in the phase\nquadrature variance \u03bc02 . From Eq. (3.8), the dominant\nterms for short times are \u03bc02 (t) \u2212 \u03b1 = \u22122\u03c7\u03b2t + \u03c72 \u03b3t2 .\nEvidently a positive value of the initial x-y covariance \u03b2\ncan, at some time t, cancel the increase in the phase variance caused by the nonzero initial amplitude variance \u03b3.\nThis effect will maximize the survival probability if the\ncancellation occurs at a time of order the survival time\n\u03c4 . This gives the second condition\n\n2. Most Robust Unconstrained Ensemble for varying \u03c7.\n\nHaving looked in detail at \u03c7 = 0 and \u03c7 = 50 we now\npresent an overview for \u03c7 ranging from 1 to 10, 000. In\nthis section we concentrate upon the most robust unconstrained ensemble. In Fig. 3 we plot the second-order moments \u03b1R , \u03b2 R , \u03b3 R defining the most robust unconstrained\nensemble E R , as a function of \u03c7. We also plot the survival time \u03c4 R for this ensemble, and, for comparison, the\n\n\u03c4 \u223c \u03b3 \u22121 \u03b2\u03c7\u22121 .\n\n(4.7)\n\nThis effect is most easily seen for the x\u0304 = 0 initial state\nin Fig. 1(c), where the phase variance at the survival\n9\n\n\ftime is little changed from its initial value whereas the\nphase variance a short time later is significantly changed.\nLastly, we consider the effect of motion and diffusion\nin the x direction. From Eq. (3.6), the amplitudequadrature variance increases at a rate of order unity.\nIt will cause a drop in the survival probability once the\nincrease is comparable to the initial amplitude variance\n\u03b3, which is at \u03c4 \u223c \u03b3. From Eq. (3.4) the mean amplitude\nx\u0304 decays to 0 at rate unity, but this will only cause a\nsignificant drop in S(\u03c4 ) when the decrease in amplitude\nis of the order of the amplitude standard deviation, that\nis for \u03c4 \u223c \u03b3 \u22121/2 , which is much longer. Thus the third\ncondition is just\n\u03c4 \u223c \u03b3 \u223c \u03b1\u22121 .\n\nshown in Fig. 5. It can be seen from this plot that the\nensemble parameters differ from those in Fig. 3 for all \u03c7.\nThat is, the PR constraint is active for all \u03c7. There is no\ndiscontinuity in the parameters, because Eq. (3.19) keeps\nthe state away from the maximum of \u03c4 in \u03b2\u2013\u03b3 space.\nThis is illustrated clearly in Fig. 4, where the shaded regions represent the PR states. It is also clear from Fig. 4\nthat, for large \u03c7, \u03b2 is effectively constrained to be negative, which is why we plot \u00b1\u03b2 rather than just \u03b2 in\nFig. 5. That is, the shearing is in the direction induced\nby the nonlinearity, rather than in the opposing direction as adopted by an unconstrained ensemble. The PR\nensemble is, not surprisingly, more physically reasonable.\nDespite these differences, the scaling laws for \u03b1R , |\u03b2 R |,\nR\n\u03b3 and \u03c4 R are the same for the most robust PR ensemble E R as for the most robust unconstrained ensemble,\nthat is\n\n(4.8)\n\nOnce again, the x\u0304 = 0 initial state in Fig. 1(c) shows\nthat there is indeed a significant increase in the amplitude variance at t equal to the survival time.\nThe maximum survival time will clearly be when the\nsurvival times from the effects above which cause decay\nof the survival probability are comparable. The unique\nsolutions to the three analytical scaling relations (4.6)\u2013\n(4.8) are the scaling laws found numerically and given in\nequations (4.2)\u2013(4.4) above.\nNot only does \u03c4 R scale in the same way as \u03b3 R , it actually asymptotes to \u03b3 R for large \u03c7. This is a consequence of our choice \u039b = 1/2, as will be shown later.\nIn any case, the ensemble-averaged survival time clearly\ndecreases with \u03c7, so that the nonlinearity causes a loss\nof robustness in the system even under a maximally robust unraveling. However, this loss of robustness is much\nworse for other ensembles. For example, the coherent\nstate ensemble E |\u03b1i has a survival time that varies as\n\u03c4\n\n|\u03b1i\n\n\u223c\u03c7\n\n\u22121\n\n,\n\n\u03b1R \u223c \u03c72/3\n\n\u03c4\n\nR\n\n\u2212\u03b2\n\n\u223c\u03b3\n\nR\n\nR\n\n\u223c\u03c7\n\n\u223c\u03c7\n\n(4.11)\n\n\u22121/3\n\n\u22122/3\n\n(4.12)\n.\n\n(4.13)\n\nThe scalings for \u03b1R , \u03b3 R and \u03c4 R can be derived using\nthe same reasoning as in the preceding case. The scaling for \u03b2 R arises as follows. For robustness the system\nwould like to have \u03b2 positive, as argued above. The constraint forces it to be negative, which is why E R is always\nconstrained, and is situated on the boundary of the PR\nregion in \u03b2\u2013\u03b3 space. For \u03c7 large and \u03b3 small, the boundary of the PR region can be found from Eq. (3.19) to\nbe\n\u2212 \u03b2 = \u03c7\u03b3 2 /4,\n\n(4.9)\n\n(4.14)\n\nwhich here scales as \u03c7\u22121/3 .\n\nas shown by the dash-dot-dot curve in Fig. 3. Thus for\nlarge \u03c7 the description of the laser steady state in terms\nof the highly amplitude-squeezed states of the most robust ensemble is much more useful than the conventional\ncoherent state description.\nThe scaling in Eq. (4.9) can be easily derived from\nEq. (3.8). Even more simply, it can in fact be derived\nfrom the asymptotic analytical formula in Eq. (2.18)\nfor the survival probability for a master equation with\na large reversible term. With P a coherent state with\nx\u0304 = 0 and Lrev \u03c1 = \u2212i[(\u03c7/4)x2 , \u03c1] we find for the solution\nS(\u03c4 ) = 1/2,\n\u221a\n\u03c4 = 8 \u03c7\u22121 .\n(4.10)\n\nB. Varying \u03bd\n\nWe turn now to the effect of excess phase noise \u03bd. Figure 6 is an overview of the most robust PR ensemble for\n\u03c7 = 0 and for \u03bd ranging from 1 to 10, 000. The behaviour\nis very simple. For \u03bd <\n\u223c 2.3 the most robust states are\ncoherent states. As \u03bd increases they become increasingly\nsqueezed states. For all values of \u03bd we have \u03b2 = 0 (which\nis therefore not plotted), indicating that the most robust\nstates are purely amplitude-squeezed. The scaling laws\nderived from this plot are\n\nEven the coefficient here is a reasonable approximation,\nas Fig. 3 shows.\n\n\u03b1R \u223c \u03bd 1/2 ,\n\u03c4\n\n3.

Unlike the nonlinear \u03c7 term, phase diffusion does not cause motion of the\n\nHaving examined the most robust unconstrained ensemble, we now determine the effect of the physical realizability constraint as \u03c7 varies from 1 to 10, 000. This is\n10\n\n\fof \u039b, and in this case the different values for \u03b1R appear\nto asymptote. In this case, the value for \u03bd above which\nthe coherent state ensemble ceases to be the most robust\nensemble increases for decreasing \u039b. Above these values\nof \u03bd the amplitude-squeezing in the most robust ensemble is always decreased as \u039b is decreased. However, the\ndifference is small (and may vanish as \u03bd \u2192 \u221e), so that\nthe equation \u03c4 R \u2243 \u03b3 R is again valid only for \u039b = 1/2.\nThe sum of these results justifies our use of the single\nvalue \u039b = 1/2 for most of this work.\n\nmean position of a typical squeezed state. Rather, from\nEq. (3.8), it simply causes the phase-quadrature variance\nto increase linearly as \u03bd\u03c4 . The survival probability will\ndrop significantly in this time if \u03bd\u03c4 is comparable to the\noriginal phase variance, \u03b1. From the increase in the amplitude variance we get \u03c4 \u223c \u03b3 \u223c \u03b1\u22121 as in Sec. IV A 2.\nThe maximum survival time occurs when these two times\nare comparable, giving \u03c4 R \u223c \u03bd \u22121/2 and \u03b1R \u223c \u03bd 1/2 , as\nfound numerically.\nThe survival time decreases with increasing \u03bd, and,\nonce again, it asymptotes to \u03b3 R for large \u03bd. For comparison we also plot the survival time \u03c4 |\u03b1i for a coherent\nstate ensemble. This scales as\n\u03c4 |\u03b1i \u223c \u03bd \u22121 ,\n\nV. DISCUSSION\n\n(4.18)\n\nA. Summary\n\nso that for large \u03bd the most robust ensemble is much more\nrobust than the coherent state ensemble. This scaling\ncan be derived from the short time asymptotic analytic\nexpression in Eq. (2.16). Since the excess phase diffusion dominates the evolution for \u03bd large we have approximately\nS(\u03c4 ) \u2243 1 + \u03bdtTr{P D[x/2]P }.\n\nThe atom laser is an open quantum system with rich\ndynamics. In this paper we have explored a new way\nof characterizing those dynamics: finding the maximally\nrobust unraveling [9]. This yields the most robust physically realizable ensemble E R of pure states P R that survive the best. By \"surviving\", we mean remaining unaffected by the system dynamics. This ensemble is, we\nhave argued, the most natural representation of the stationary state matrix \u03c1ss of the laser; if one wished to\nregard the laser as being \"really\" in a pure state, then\nthe most natural states to choose are the members of this\nensemble. Although it is a time-independent ensemble,\nit is drastically affected by alterations in the dynamics of\nthe atom laser that do not change the stationary state\nmatrix.\nWe considered a simple model for the atom laser in\nwhich \u03c1ss is a Poissonian mixture of number states of\nmean \u03bc. Working in the linearized regime, we identified\ntwo relevant dynamical parameters that may be varied\nwithout altering this stationary state. The first is \u03c7,\nwhich is proportional to the strength of self-interaction\nof the atoms in the laser. The second is \u03bd, which is proportional to the excess phase diffusion of the laser above\nthe standard quantum limit.\nFor \u03c7 = 0 and \u03bd small, the most robust ensemble\nwas found to consist of coherent states, with mean boson\nnumber \u03bc but with all possible phases. This is the most\ncommon representation of the state of an optical laser,\nand so it is not surprising. In terms of the parameters we\nused in the paper, the ensemble consists of Gaussian pure\nstates with phase quadrature variance \u03b1 = 1, amplitudequadrature variance \u03b3 = 1, and amplitude\u2013phase covariance \u03b2 = 0.\nAs the self-energy \u03c7 is increased the most robust states\ncease to be coherent states. In fact, for any nonzero\nvalue of \u03c7, not only are the coherent states not the most\nrobust state; in addition they are not even physically\nrealizable [3]. For large values of \u03c7 the most robust\nstates P R are very highly amplitude-squeezed states with\namplitude-quadrature variance \u03b3 R scaling as \u03c7\u22122/3 and\nphase quadrature variance \u03b1R scaling as \u03c72/3 . The same\n\n(4.19)\n\nAgain, this expression only applies for a single state or\nan ensemble such as the coherent state ensemble where\nall members are effectively identical. In the latter case it\nevaluates simply to 1 \u2212 \u03bdt/4.\nC. Varying \u039b\n\nThe final parameter we wish to consider varying is\n\u039b, which defines the survival time \u03c4 by the equation\nS(\u03c4 ) = \u039b. All of the results presented so far were for\n\u039b = 0.5. In Fig. 8 we show the parameters \u03b1R and\n\u03c4 R for the most robust ensemble as a function of \u03c7 for\n\u03bd = 0 and for four values of \u039b. For large \u03c7 the slope of\nthe curves are independent of \u039b. Thus the scaling laws\nestablished in Sec. IV A are independent of \u039b. As \u039b decreases, the survival time \u03c4 R increases, because it takes\nlonger for the survival probability to decay to that level.\nDecreasing \u039b also causes the phase variance \u03b1R to increase, indicating that the most robust states are more\nhighly squeezed. This is not unexpected, since the difference between the coherent state ensemble and the most\nrobust ensemble is expected to be greater at longer times\nby the argument in Sec. IV A 1. However, the relative\nincrease in \u03b1R is far less than the relative increase in \u03c4 R .\nIn other words, the most robust ensemble is only weakly\ndependent on \u039b. Interestingly, because \u03b3 R \u223c 1/\u03b1R , \u03b3 R\ndecreases as \u039b decreases, while \u03c4 R increases. Thus the\nasymptotic result \u03b3 R \u2243 \u03c4 R can only be true at one value\nof \u039b, namely \u039b = 1/2.\nFigure 9 presents the same information as Fig. 8 but\nfor \u03c7 = 0 and varying \u03bd and \u039b. Once again the scaling\nlaws established in Sec. IV B are found to be independent\n11\n\n\feffect occurs for large values of \u03bd, with scalings of \u03bd \u22121/2\nand \u03bd 1/2 respectively.\nIt is not known what value of \u03bd would be appropriate\nto model a realistic atom laser. However, it was argued\nin Ref. [3] that a typical value for \u03c7 might be 1000. This\nimplies that the most natural description of an atom laser\nwould be in terms of highly amplitude squeezed stated,\nwith the standard deviation in the amplitude quadrature\nbeing of order 0.1. Excess phase noise would only increase the amount of squeezing in the states in the most\nrobust ensemble.\nAs noted above, our analysis was based on a linearized\napproximation for the laser dynamics. This is only valid\nif the states under consideration have a well-defined coherent amplitude. As \u03c7 or \u03bd are increased indefinitely\nand the most robust states become more amplitudesqueezed, this approximation will clearly break down.\nSpecifically, it will break down when the phase variance\npredicted by the linearized analysis is of order unity; that\nis, when the the phase quadrature variance \u03b1R is of order\nthe mean boson number \u03bc. From the above scalings, for\nthe linearization to remain valid we require\n\u03c7 \u226a \u03bc3/2 ,\n\u03bd \u226a \u03bc2 .\n\nmally robust unravelings as an investigational tool for\nopen quantum systems.\nIt must be emphasized that the link between the presence or absence of a mean field inside the laser, and the\npresence or absence of quantum coherence in the laser\noutput, is not due to any simple relationship of definitions. Finding the maximally robust ensemble is, as\nthe diligent reader will appreciate, a very involved process completely different from calculating the first-order\ncoherence function. In particular, the average survival\ntime for the members of the most robust ensemble has in\ngeneral no relationship with the coherence time.\nC. Comparison with Purity\n\nIt is worth pointing out that the relationship we have\nestablished between robust mean-field states and quantum degeneracy would not have been found had we used\npurity rather than survival probability as the basis of our\ndefinition for the most robust ensemble. Although there\nare no great differences between the two definitions as one\nvaries \u03bd, there is a great difference as one varies \u03c7. This\nis to be expected from the analysis in Sec. II C 2, as \u03c7\nscales the self-energy Hamiltonian, whereas \u03bd represents\nirreversible phase diffusion.\nTo prove this point we have calculated the ensemble\nthat maximizes the time it takes for the average purity\nof the member states [as defined in Eq. (2.10)] to drop\nto 1/2 under the master equation evolution. We plot\nthe parameters for this ensemble as a function of \u03c7 in\nFig. 9. For comparison we also plot the phase quadrature variance \u03b1R and the survival time \u03c4 R of the most\nrobust ensemble as previously defined, in terms of survival probability. The ensemble parameters when we use\npurity obey scaling laws for large \u03c7, but they are different\nfrom those scaling laws obtained when using the survival\nprobability (Sec. V A 2):\n\n(5.1)\n(5.2)\n\nAlthough we cannot say with confidence what the most\nrobust states are when the linearization breaks down, we\ndo know that they must be states without a well-defined\ncoherent amplitude (because that is why the linearization\nbreaks down). Therefore the conditions in Eqs. (5.1) and\n(5.2) also represent the conditions for the most robust\nstates to be states with well-defined coherent amplitudes.\nIn other words, if and only if these conditions are satisfied, the most natural description of the atom laser is in\nterms of states with a mean field.\n\nB. Interpretation\n\n\u2032\n\n\u03b1R \u223c \u03c71/2 ,\n\nWe can now finally state the most important result of\nthis paper. The conditions (5.1) and (5.2) are identical\nto the previously stated conditions (3.10) and (3.11) for\nthe output of the device to be coherent. Here we mean\ncoherent in the sense that the output is quantum degenerate, with many bosons being emitted per coherence\ntime. Without this condition the device could not be\nconsidered a laser at all, as its output would consist of\nindependent atoms rather than a matter wave.\nThe significance of this result is that there is a perfect\ncorrespondence between the 'best' pure states for describing the laser, and the coherence of its output. If the most\nrobust states have a well-defined coherent amplitude, like\ncoherent states, then the output is coherent. If the most\nrobust states do not have a well-defined coherent amplitude, like number states, then the output is not coherent.\nThis profound result establishes the usefulness of maxi-\n\n\u03c4\n\nR\u2032\n\n\u03b2\n\nR\u2032\n\n\u223c \u03b3\n\nR\u2032\n\n(5.3)\n\n\u2248 \u22121/4,\n\n\u223c\u03c7\n\n\u22121/2\n\n.\n\n(5.4)\n(5.5)\n\nAs expected from Sec. II C 2, the purity half-life is much\nlonger than the survival time for large \u03c7. Here we use R\u2032\nrather than R to emphasize that we are using a different\nmeasure of robustness.\nThe scalings in Eqs. (5.3)\u2013(5.5) can be derived analytically. For Gaussian states with moments \u03bcmn (t), the\npurity at time t is given by\n\u0002\n\u0003\nTr \u03c12 (t) = p(t) = [\u03bc20 (t)\u03bc02 (t) \u2212 \u03bc211 (t)]\u22121/2 . (5.6)\n\nFor \u03bd = 0, \u03b3 \u226a 1, \u03b2 \u223c 1, \u03c7 \u226b 1 and t \u226a 1, as appropriate here, the solutions (3.6)\u2013(3.8), together with the\ncondition p(t) = 1/2, yield the following equation for \u03c4\n3 \u2248 2(1 + \u03b2 2 )\u03c4 /\u03b3 \u2212 2\u03c7\u03b2\u03c4 2 + 2\u03c72 \u03b3\u03c4 3 /3 + \u03c72 \u03c4 4 /3. (5.7)\n12\n\n\fIt is clear from the term O(\u03c4 4 ) that \u03c4 will scale as \u03c7\u22121/2 .\nTo maximize \u03c4 , the terms O(\u03c4 ) and O(\u03c4 3 ) imply that\n\u03b3 should scale as \u03c7\u22121/2 in accord with Eq. (5.5) . The\nterms O(\u03c4 ) and O(\u03c4 2 ) then imply that \u03b2 should be positive, and of order unity.\nIndeed, for the unconstrained\n\u2032\nGaussian ensemble E R we find \u03b2 \u2248 1.8. With the constraint of Eq. (4.14), we get \u03b2 negative and of order unity,\nas stated above.\nThe condition for the best purity-preserving\nstates to\n\u2032\nhave a well-defined coherent amplitude is \u03b1R \u226a \u03bc, which\nfrom Eq. (5.3) gives\n\u03c7 \u226a \u03bc2 .\n\naccording to our definition based on maximizing\nthe sur\u2032\nvival time. Thus unlike E R , but like E R , the coherence\nof its members does not have a direct correspondence\nwith the laser output coherence (in the conventional, unconditional, sense).\nThe correspondence (at least in scaling laws) between\n\u2032\nQSD\nE\nand E R is actually in contrast to the result found\nby Di\u00f3si and Kiefer (for a different system) [14]. They\nfound that PR states minimizing the loss of purity were\ndifferent from states produced by QSD. However, as\nnoted earlier, they considered only the initial rate of loss\nof purity, which is insensitive to Hamiltonian terms. If\nthey had considered maximizing the half-life of the purity, as we have, they may have obtained a different result.\n\n(5.8)\n\nThis implies that there is a range of interaction strengths\n2\n\u03bc3/2 <\n\u223c \u03c7 \u226a \u03bc for which the purity analysis delivers a description of the laser in terms of states with a mean field\neven though the laser output is no longer coherent in the\nsense defined above. This regime can be interpreted in\nterms of a the non-standard concept of conditional coherence, explored in detail in the preceding paper [3]. The\nbasic idea is well illustrated by Fig. 1. If one knows the\nmean amplitude of the state with an uncertainty much\nless than unity, as in Fig. 1(d), then the direction that\nit will move in phase space can be predicted with accuracy. This motion (which amounts to different frequencies) can then be taken into account in experiments the\noutput. Thus the spread in frequencies due to spread in\namplitude can be compensated for (up to a point).\n\nE. Future Work\n\nThere are at least three future directions for this work.\nFirst, the insights into the atom laser that the maximally\nrobust unravelings analysis offers suggests that this technique could be applied fruitfully to other open quantum\nsystems. It has already been applied to fluorescent atoms\n[16], and could also be applied to other quantum optical\nsystems [17], and other models for Bose-Einstein condensates in equilibrium with a reservoir [23]. These are all\nsystems with nontrivial dynamics, which could be more\nfully appreciated by determining the maximally robust\nunraveling.\nSecond, the difference between the analyses based on\nsurvival probability and purity deserves further investigation. As we showed, the purity analysis gives a description of the laser mode in terms of states with a welldefined coherent amplitude for high values of \u03c7 where the\nsurvival analysis does not, and where the output is not\ncoherent in the conventional sense. Nevertheless the results do make sense in terms of conditional coherence [3].\nPerhaps it is because purity is unaffected by the motion\nof the mean position of the states in phase space that it\nreflects conditional coherence, which relies on knowledge\nof that motion to define the output mode. By contrast,\nthe survival probability is affected by the motion of the\nstates, and hence reflects conventional coherence that averages over the different frequencies of rotation.\nFinally, there are other approaches to quantifying the\nrobustness of unravelings apart from the survival probability and the purity. For example, one could measure\nhow quickly the unraveling purifies the state, or how\nsensitive the purity is to imperfections in the unravelings. Related ideas have recently been explored [15,24].\nThese ideas could be best investigated in systems somewhat simpler than the atom laser we have considered\nhere. This would give an indication for the robustness of\nthe idea of robustness; that is, how sensitive the maximally robust unraveling is to the definition of robustness\nused, and which definitions agree.\n\nD. Comparison with Quantum State Diffusion\n\nA particular PR ensemble of interest is that generated by the unraveling known as quantum state diffusion\n(QSD) [21,22]. This is merely a particularly simple and\nnatural type of continuous Markovian unraveling. It has\nbeen suggested [14] that the corresponding ensemble is\na good candidate for the most robust ensemble. We investigated this ensemble in the preceding paper [3] and\nfound analytically that its parameters \u03b2 and \u03b3\u2032 have exactly the same scaling as the PR ensemble E R based on\nmaximizing the robustness as measured by purity. That\nis, with \u03c7,\n\u221a\n(5.9)\n\u03b1QSD \u2243 2\u03c71/2 ,\nQSD\n\u03b2\n\u2243 \u22121,\n(5.10)\n\u221a \u22121/2\nQSD\n\u03b3\n\u2243 2\u03c7\n.\n(5.11)\nand with \u03bd,\n1\n\u03b1QSD \u2243 \u221a \u03bd 1/2 ,\n2\n\u03b2 QSD = 0,\n\u221a\n\u03b3 QSD \u2243 2\u03bd \u22121/2 .\n\n(5.12)\n(5.13)\n(5.14)\n\nConsequently, the QSD ensemble E QSD scales with \u03c7\nquite differently from the maximally robust ensemble E R\n13\n\n\fTo conclude, the clear and simple interpretation for\nthe results we have obtained here for the atom laser vindicates our conviction [9] that maximally robust unravelings will have an increasing role as a tool for understanding the dynamics of open quantum systems.\n\n[24] Z.

The evolution of (initially pure) Gaussian quantum states under the linearized laser master equation for four\ndifferent cases. The states are represented by the one standard-deviation ellipse of the Wigner function. In the all cases\nwe choose the initial mean location of the state in phase space\nto be x\u0304p= \u0233 = 0, and for the last two we additionally have\nx\u0304 = \u00b1 3/2. For all four cases the excess phase diffusion is\n\u03bd = 0. For case (a) we have \u03c7 = 0 and an initially coherent\nstate (which forms the most robust ensemble in this case).\nFor case (b) we have \u03c7 = 50 and again an initially coherent\nstate.
