During this inflationary stage,\nfluctuations of quantum origin of the scalar field(s) driving the inflationary phase are\nproduced. As these fluctuations are stretched up to scales much larger than the Hubble radius at the time when they were produced, they can explain all inhomogeneities\nwe see today even on the largest cosmological scales. The quantum to classical transition of these fluctuations is of fundamental importance as the inhomogeneities we\nobserve do not display any property typical of their quantum origin. As was shown\nearlier, this transition is actually a generic feature of all inflationary perturbations.\nThe very mechanism by which inflationary perturbations are produced on cosmological scales leads to their effective classicality.\nOn large cosmological scales probed by the observations, the quantum origin\nevades observation in the following sense: fluctuations on large cosmological scales appear to us as random classical quantities [1, 2]. More precisely, they have a stochastic\namplitude, with a probability density deriving from the wave function of the fluctuations quantum state, a fixed temporal phase, and probabilities can be consistently\nassigned to classical trajectories in phase-space [3]. These are the characteristics of\nthe inflationary fluctuations which allow a successful qualitative description of the\nCosmic Microwave Background (CMB) temperature anisotropy on all angular scales,\nas well as the formation of Large Scale Structure (LSS) through gravitational instability.\nIt was realized already some time ago that a spectrum of primordial fluctuations\ncan lead to the formation of Primordial Black Holes and that these could have some\nobservational consequences [4, 5, 6]. For this aim, a spectrum of primordial fluctuations is needed. Once its statistics, amplitude, etc. are known, it is possible in\nprinciple to compute the abundance of produced PBH. This spectrum does not have to\nbe of quantum origin, on the contrary: what was considered initially was a spectrum\nof classical primordial fluctuations. Inflationary models can produce the fluctuations\nspectrum relevant for the formation of PBH. Actually the formation of PBH is a\nnew addition to the set of existing observational constraints on inflationary models\n[7, 8, 9, 10], including pre-big bang inflationary models [11] and they are in turn related to other cosmological observations [12, 13]. In early papers on PBH formation,\nthe statistics of the fluctuations was taken for simplicity to be Gaussian and this fits\nwell most of the inflationary models. However the new feature of the inflationary\nfluctuations comes precisely from what makes the inflationary paradigm successful:\nthe generation of cosmological primordial fluctuations from quantum fluctuations.\nWhile the classical behaviour of the inflationary fluctuations is definitely very accurate for the description of the Cosmic Microwave Background temperature anisotropy\nand Large Scale Structure formation, we will see that in the context of PBH formation\nthis is not always the case. Indeed the very mechanism by which PBH are produced\ndoes not guarantee the classicality of the primordial fluctuations on all scales, and for\nthe corresponding formation times. Actually, as we will see there is a range of PBH\n1\n\n\fmass scales for which the classicality cannot be assumed. This of course leads to some\ninteresting questions at the level of basic principles. We will first review the formation\nof PBH and the quantum to classical transition of inflationary fluctuations. This will\nallow us to pinpoint when and why the classicality of the fluctuations producing the\nPBH no longer holds.\n\n2\n\nPBH formation\n\nWe consider first how PBH can be generated. It was realized long ago, before the\nadvent of the inflationary scenario that a spectrum of primordial density fluctuations, unavoidable for galaxy formation, would inevitably lead to the production of\nprimordial black holes.\nFor simplicity, we assume that a PBH is formed when the density contrast averaged\nover a volume of the (linear) size of the Hubble radius satisfies \u03b1 \u2264 \u03b4 \u2264 \u03b2, and that\nthe PBH mass M is just the \"horizon mass\" MH , the mass contained inside the\nHubble volume. A physical scale R(t) is defined by the corresponding wavenumber\nk, and it evolves with time according to R(t) = 2\u03c0 a(t)\n. For a given physical scale\nk\nR(t), the \"horizon\" crossing time tk \u2013 here we do not mean \"horizon\" crossing during\ninflation but after inflation \u2013 is the time when that scale reenters the Hubble radius.\nHere we do not mean \"horizon\" crossing during inflation but after inflation, which\nwill inevitably take place for scales that are larger than the Hubble radius at the\nend of inflation. We will simply assume that it is at that time tk that a PBH might\nform with mass MH (tk ). Obviously, there is a one to one correspondence between\nR(tk ), MH (tk ) and k. We can of course also make the correspondence at any other\ninitial time ti and then relate the various physical quantities at both times ti and\ntk . Therefore, PBH might form on scales as small as the Hubble radius right after\nthe transition to the radiation dominated phase at the end of inflation. Hence the\nearliest PBH formation time te corresponds to the end of the inflationary stage when\nthe lightest PBH with M \u223c MH (te ) are formed.\nFor concreteness, we assume further that the primordial fluctuations obey a Gaussian statistics with probability density p(\u03b4), where \u03b4 is the density contrast averaged\nover a sphere of radius R, given by\n2\n1\n\u2212 \u03b42\n2\u03c3\n(R) .\np(\u03b4) = \u221a\ne\n2\u03c0 \u03c3(R)\n\nThe dispersion \u03c3 2 (R) \u2261 \u03c3R2 =\n\nD\u0010\n\n\u03c3R2 =\n\n\u03b4M\nM\n\n\u00112 E\nR\n\n(1)\n\nis computed using a window function WR\n\n1 Z\u221e\ndk k 2 P (k) WR2 (k) ,\n2\u03c0 2 0\n\n(2)\n\nwhere WR (k) stands for the Fourier transform of the window function (usually one\nuses a Top Hat or a Gaussian window function but this is unimportant for the problem\nconsidered here) divided by the probed volume VW , while P (k) is the power spectrum\nof \u03b4 \u2261 \u03b4\u03c1/\u03c1. Therefore the probability P (M) that a PBH is formed on a scale R(tk ),\n2\n\n\fwith a mass M \u2261 MH (tk ) equal to the mass contained inside the Hubble radius when\nthat scale reenters the Hubble radius, is given by\n1\nP (M) = \u221a\n2\u03c0 \u03c3(R)\n\nZ\n\n\u03b2\n\n\u03b1\n\n\u2212\n\ne\n\n\u03b42\n2\u03c3 2 (R)\n\n,\n\n(3)\n\n2\nwhere M stands for MH (tk ), R stands for R(tk ) and \u03c3 2 (R) \u2261 \u03c3H\n(tk ). Using the\nprimordial fluctuation spectrum produced by an inflationary model, one can compute\nthe production of PBH.\n\n3\n\nEffective classicality of the perturbations\n\nThe crucial point is that, independently of whether this description is acurate or not\n(we will return to that point later and consider also near critical collapse of PBH\n[14]), all the technical details given above fundamentally assume that the underlying spectrum of fluctuations is classical: the fluctuations and therefore their Fourier\ntransform are all classical stochastic quantities and the power spectrum P (k) can\ntherefore be treated as a classical power spectrum. Though, the same expressions\narise in the description of inflationary perturbations, the physics behind the formulas can be radically different if the classicality of the fluctuations is not guaranteed.\nAs said before, this effective classicality is guaranteed for cosmological perturbations\nprobed by the CMB anisotropy and LSS formation.\nIn inflationary models, density fluctuations as well as the CMB anisotropy arise\nfrom quantum fluctuations of the inflaton(s), the scalar field(s) driving inflation (we\nwill take only one inflaton field for simplicity). Let us see where the effective classicality of these fluctuations comes from. As usual for linear equations, one works\nin Fourier space. We will follow closely here the notation of [1, 15]. If one works\nin the Heisenberg representation, one makes a usual expansion of the (\"amplitude\")\noperators in terms of creation and annihilation operators\ny(k, \u03b7) \u2261 fk (\u03b7) a(k, \u03b70 ) + fk\u2217 (\u03b7) a\u2020 (\u2212k, \u03b70 ) ,\n\n(4)\n\nwhere fk are the field modes obeying the wave equation of the corresponding quantity.\nFor our purposes, it is convenient to use the equivalent expansion in terms of initial\namplitudes and conjugate momenta\ny(k, \u03b7) =\n\n\u221a\n\n2k fk1 (\u03b7) y(k, \u03b70) \u2212\n\ns\n\n2\nfk2 (\u03b7) p(k, \u03b70 ) ,\nk\n\n(5)\n\nwhere fk1 , resp. fk2 , corresponds to the real, resp. imaginary, part of fk .\nThe dynamics in the inflationary case is very peculiar. Indeed, two linearly independent solutions can be found, here fk1 and fk2 , with very different behaviours. In\nthe course of time one of the two solutions (fk1 ), typically called the \"growing\" mode,\ncomes to dominate over the other one (fk2 ), the \"decaying\" mode. At reentrance\ninside the Hubble radius during the radiation-dominated, or the matter-dominated,\nstage, the decaying mode is usually vanishingly small, and can therefore be safely\n3\n\n\fneglected. A a result, the operator behaves like a stochastic classical quantity: the\nprobability for a particular realization is found using an initial probability density distribution which evolves according to the classical equations of motion. This applies on\nall scales where the decaying mode is vanishingly small, usually the interesting ones in\ninflationary cosmology. In an alternative, but completely equivalent, language, these\nare the scales where the squeezing is tremendously high.\nLet us assume now that one would have a purely classical mechanism to produce\nthe fluctuations at some primordial time ti . Let us even assume that this mechanism\nwould be able to put these classical perturbations on scales far beyond the Hubble\nradius at that time ti (which is of course precisely the crucial problem that is solved\nby inflation). So, in a sense, for all practical purposes regarding the generation of\nfluctuations, this mechanism would do the same job as does inflation. Then the\nperturbations would have the same expansion as the inflationary ones with three\nnotable differences:\na) The initial amplitudes and momenta are non-commuting operators in the inflationary case, and of course, by definition, classical quantities in the second case.\nb) The relative amplitude of the \"decaying\" part to that of the \"growing\" part is\nfixed by quantization in the inflationary case and a priori free in the second case. So\nin order to compute the fluctuations on cosmological scales, one must know in the\n\"classical\" case, the ratio of both parts at the time ti and specify this time ti . In the\ninflationary case, this ratio is fixed initially (by quantization) at the Hubble radius\ncrossing time during inflation, and can be computed at any later time.\nc) Finally, even for the ab initio classical perturbations, the presence of the \"decaying\"\npart would spoil the fixed phase of the perturbations, seen for example in the Sakharov\noscillations of baryonic fluctuations (and of course also in the acoustic peaks in the\nCMB anisotropy). In the inflationary case however, it has much more dramatic\nconsequences: fluctuations are no longer undistinguishable from classical stochastic\nquantities. That can be seen directly from the fact that the Wigner function will have\na width which is no longer negligible, it is negligible only when the decaying mode is\nnegligible.\nIf the decaying part were still present, in the classical system one should use a\nprobability density in phase-space in order to compute average values, etc. for the\nfluctuations. Then, in the inflationary case, the quantum nature of the fluctuations\nwould necessarily resurface as a probability density in phase-space does not exist.\nHowever when the decaying part is negligible, we need only probability densities for\nthe initial amplitudes, derived straightforwardly from their wave function. This result\nis reinforced for a large class of environments when very high squeezing, and therefore\nvanishing of the decaying mode, holds [16, 17]. Note that for small PBH, possible\nmechanisms of decoherence by the environment (see e.g.[18, 19]) are not a priori\nrestricted, like on large cosmological scales, by observational constraints exhibiting the\nfixed phase of the perturbations [20]. In inflationary perturbations vacuum states are\nrelevant hence the probabilities are Gaussian, but the effective quantum to classical\ntransition would apply to non vacuum initial states as well (see [15] for a discussion).\nScales of interest for the generation of PBH span a range which is many orders\nof magnitude smaller than those probed by Large Scale Structure surveys and cer4\n\n\ftainly than scales probed by CMB anisotropy observations. This implies that PBH\ngeneration gives the possibility to probe a very distinct part of the inflaton potential. But even more, and this is what we want to stress in this letter, the problem\nof the classicality of the primordial inflationary fluctuations could resurface during\nPBH generation.\n\n4\n\nClassicality of PBH production\n\nWhere is now the problem with PBH? It lies in the very fact that PBH can be produced as soon as the fluctuations reenter the Hubble radius after inflation. However,\nfor the smallest possible scales, corresponding to the smallest masses, the decaying\nmode still \"had no time\" to disappear! As a consequence, all that was said above\ndoes not apply anymore to these small scales. In particular, one cannot speak anymore about classical fluctuations with consistently assigned probabilities on which\nthe above formulas rely. In order to make quantitative estimates, let us consider the\npeculiar gravitational potential \u03a6(k). It is simply related to the power spectrum P (k)\nby Poisson's equation. Its expansion is analogous to (4) (or (5)) [15]\n\u03a6(k, \u03b7) = \u03a6k (\u03b7) a(k, \u03b70 ) + \u03a6\u2217k (\u03b7) a\u2020 (\u2212k, \u03b70 ) .\n\n(6)\n\nFurther, everything that was said about eq.(4,5) will apply to eq.(6) for the quantity\n\u03a6. Clearly, the degree to which the effective quantum to classical transition will\noccur (and therefore quantum interference will be essentially suppressed) is given by\nthe ratio\n\u03a6k,gr\nDk \u2261\n(7)\n\u03a6k,dec\nof the growing to the decaying mode of the peculiar gravitational potential \u03a6(k). Very\nlarge values for D will correspond to an effective quantum-to-classical transition. It is\nphysically appealing to give the result as a function of the PBH masses M. Then, for\nadiabatic fluctuations produced during the inflationary stage, this is very elegantly\nexpressed as\nD(M) = 4A GHk2\n\u2243 4 GHk2\n\nM2\nMp2\n\n(8)\n\nMH (te )2\nMp2\n\nfor k \u223c ke \u2261 (aH)te ,\n\n(9)\n\nwhere A is the growth factor of the peculiar gravitational potential \u03a6(k) between\nthe inflationary stage and the radiation dominated stage, while Hk , resp. Vk , is the\nHubble parameter, resp. the inflaton potential, at Hubble radius crossing during the\ninflationary stage, and finally Mp is the Planck mass. The growth factor is model\ndependent, it is generically larger than one, and of order one for scales crossing the\nHubble radius towards the end of inflation. The ratio D(M) will grow with increasing\nPBH masses M, due essentially to the last term in expression (8). Clearly, there is a\nrange of scales, those exiting the Hubble radius towards the end of inflation te , where\n5\n\n\fD will not be large and the quantum nature of the fluctuations is important. This\neffect will be maximal for masses M \u223c 1g corresponding to the horizon mass MH (te )\nat the end of inflation. Equations (8,9) refer to adiabatic perturbations produced\nduring inflation. It is interesting to note that precisely for those scales k \u223c ke , PBH\ncould be produced by parametric amplification of the fluctuations, the details being\nmodel dependent [21]. By a mechanism analogous to the one described in the previous\nSection, namely the disappearance of an exponenetially decaying mode, the growing\nmode of the parametrically amplified fluctuations would quickly become classical.\nHence, depending on the efficiency of preheating, the generation process of part of\nthe PBH formed on these very small scales could be essentially classical as well.\nThere is a natural cut-off in the PBH masses due to PBH evaporation and it is\ninteresting therefore to relate our result to this phenomenon. Indeed, it is well known\nthat the lifetime of a Black Hole is simply related to its initial mass. Hence, PBH\nwith masses less than M\u2217 \u2248 1015 g will have either completely evaporated or in any\ncase be in the latest stage of their evaporation. For these PBH, quantum mechanics\nresurface crucially in their evaporation process so that the quantum origin of the\nfluctuations leading to their generation becomes less important. And anyway, these\nPBH will have disappeared under the form of a radiation with a thermal spectrum.\nHence, it is interesting to investigate in particular what happens to those surviving\nPBH, those with masses M > M\u2217 . If we consider for example chaotic single-field\nslow-roll inflation with inflaton potential V = 12 m2 \u03c62 , then the following result is\nobtained\nVk M\u22172\n\u223c 1028 .\n(10)\nD(M\u2217 ) \u2243 32A 4\nMp Mp2\nGenerally, if one considers conservative values pertaining to inflationary stages, namely\nGHk2 > 10\u221220 , we still obtain a very high upper bound\nD(M > M\u2217 ) > 1020 .\n\n(11)\n\nEquations (10,11) have been derived assuming that the PBH mass is related to the\nformation time (and scale) as M = MH (tk ). Recently, it has been shown numerically\nthat PBH formation may occur by near critical collapse [14]. This changes the exact\nrelation between the PBH mass and the \"horizon\" mass MH (tk ) and the abundance\nof produced PBH as a function of mass M [22]. In this case, eq.(8) will be simply\nreplaced by\nM2\nD(M) = 4A GHk2 H2 ,\n(12)\nMp\nwhere the PBH mass M is now some function of MH which is not fixed by MH alone.\nAt a given time, PBH of different masses can be produced by near critical collapse.\nBut it introduces no fundamental change concerning the quantum to classical transition of non evaporated PBH as the produced PBH at some time tk by near critical\ncollapse cannot have masses much larger than MH (tk ).\nAs is obvious from eq.(11), one can safely use the effective classicality of the\nfluctuations for the non-evaporated PBH. Hence, for all PBH produced after approximately 10\u221223 seconds, quantum-to-classical transition is already extremely effective.\n6\n\n\fThis means that quantum interference for these PBH is essentially suppressed and\none can really work to tremendously high accuracy with classical probability distributions: probability can be assigned consistently to the fluctuations leading to the\nformation of PBH not yet evaporated.\nThere has been some suggestions recently that transplanckian frequencies obey a\ndifferent dispersion law and may change some of the standard results pertaining to\nthe inflationary primordial fluctuations (for a review see e.g.[23]). Typically in inflationary scenarios, the crucial time is the Hubble radius crossing time. At that time\nthe Hubble radius is much lower than the Planck mass Mp and the usual dispersion\nlaw must hold. Put aside the question whether the claim based on some new transplanckian physics is consistent with observations (see [24] for a recent discussion),\nthe vanishing of the decaying mode is solely based on subplanckian dynamics and\nthe results derived here would be unaffected by any transplanckian new physics. In\nconclusion, all the scales for which the quantum nature of the fluctuations generating\nPBH could reveal itself are \"hidden\" deeply inside the scales affected by PBH evaporation. It is unclear whether PBH relics, if they exist at all, could unveil the quantum\norigin of the fluctuations generating them.\n\nReferences\n[1] D. Polarski, A. A. Starobinsky, Class.
