Introduction\nSome time ago the PHENIX and STAR collaborations have measured\ntransverse momentum distribution of so-called nonphotonic electrons [1, 2].\n\u2217\n\nPresented at Strangeness in Quark Matter 2011, Sept. 18-24, Cracow, Poland.\n\n(1)\n\n\f2\n\nsqm \u0307szczurek\n\nprinted on October 17, 2018\n\nIt is a common wisdom that the dominant contribution to the nonphotonic\nelectrons/positrons comes from the semileptonic decays of charm and/or\nbeauty mesons. Formally such processes can be divided into three subsequent stages. First cc\u0304 or bb\u0304 quarks are produced. The dominant mechanisms being gluon-gluon fusion and quark-antiquark annihilation close to the\nthreshold. Next the heavy quarks/antiquarks fragment into heavy charmed\nmesons D, D \u2217 or B, B \u2217 . The vector D \u2217 and B \u2217 mesons decay strongly producing (pseudo)scalar D and B mesons. Finally the heavy pseudoscalar\nmesons decay semileptonically producing electrons/positrons.\nThe hadronization of heavy quarks is usually done with the help of\nphenomenological fragmentation functions. with parameters adjusted to\nthe production of heavy mesons in e+ e\u2212 or pp\u0304 collisions.\nThe last ingredient are semileptonic decays of heavy mesons. Only recently the CLEO [3] and BABAR [4] collaborations has measured precise\nspectra of electrons/positrons coming from the decays of D and B mesons.\nThis is done by producing specific resonances: \u03a8(3770) which decays into\nD and D\u0304 mesons (CLEO) and \u03a5(4S) which decays into B and B\u0304 mesons\n(BABAR). In both cases the heavy mesons are almost at rest, so in practice\none measures the meson rest frame distributions of electrons/positrons.\nIn this presentation the results have been obtained within the kt -factorization\napproach. At rather low RHIC energies intermediate x-values become relevant. The Kwiecinski unintegrated gluon (parton) distributions seem the\nbest suited in this context [8]. We shall use both Peterson [9] and socalled perturbative [10] fragmentation functions. The electron/positron decay functions fitted recently [12] to the recent CLEO and BABAR data will\nbe used.\nRecently the PHENIX collaboration has measured\u221a dilepton invariant\nmass spectrum from 0 to 8 GeV in pp collisions at s = 200 GeV [7].\nUp to now, production of open charm and bottom was studied only in\ninclusive measurements of charmed mesons [5] and electrons [6] and only\ninclusive observables were calculated in pQCD approach [11, 12]. Such\npredictions give rather good description of the experimental data, however,\nthe theoretical uncertainties are quite large.\nSome time ago we have studied kinematical correlations of cc\u0304 quarks [14],\nwhich is, however, difficult to study experimentally. High luminosity and in\na consequence better statistics at present colliders gives a new possibility to\nstudy not only inclusive distributions but also correlations between outgoing\nparticles. Kinematical correlations constitute an alternative method to pin\ndown the cross section for charm and bottom production.\nBelow I shall limit to presentation of results obtained in [12, 13]. The\noriginal presentation at the conference included also diffractive processes.\n\n\fsqm \u0307szczurek\n\n3\n\nprinted on October 17, 2018\n\n2. Formalism\nLet us consider the reaction h1 + h2 \u2192 Q + Q\u0304 + X, where Q and Q\u0304 are\nheavy quark and heavy antiquark, respectively.\n\nh1\n\nh1\nQ\n\nQ\nQ\u0304\nh2\n\nQ\u0304\nh2\n\nFig. 1.\nBasic diagrams relevant for gluon-gluon fusion (left panel) and quarkantiquark annihilation (right panel) in our kt -factorization approach.\n\nIn the kt -factorization approach the multiply differential cross section\nreads:\nX\nd\u03c3\n=\n2\n2\ndy1 dy2 d p1,t d p2,t\ni,j\n\nZ\n\n1\nd2 \u03ba1,t d2 \u03ba2,t\n|Mij |2\n2\n\u03c0\n\u03c0 16\u03c0 (x1 x2 s)2\n\n\u03b42 (~\u03ba1,t + ~\u03ba2,t \u2212 p~1,t \u2212 p~2,t ) Fi (x1 , \u03ba21,t ) Fj (x2 , \u03ba22,t ) ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere Fi (x1 , \u03ba21,t ) and Fj (x2 , \u03ba22,t ) are the so-called unintegrated gluon (parton) distributions. Leading-order matrix elements for off-shell gluons [15,\n16, 17] were used. The two-dimensional Dirac delta function assures momentum conservation. The unintegrated parton distributions are evaluated\nat:\nm\nm\nm\nm\nx1 = \u221a1,t\nexp(y1 ) + \u221a2,t\nexp(y2 ), x2 = \u221a1,t\nexp(\u2212y1 ) + \u221a2,t\nexp(\u2212y2 ), where\ns\ns\ns\ns\nmi,t =\n\nq\n\np2i,t + m2Q .\n\n~ t = ~\u03ba1,t + ~\u03ba2,t ,\nIntroducing new variables: Q\nq~t = ~\u03ba1,t \u2212 ~\u03ba2,t we can write:\nd\u03c3ij\n=\ndy1 dy2 d2 p1,t d2 p2,t\n\nZ\n\nd2 qt\n\n1\n1\n|Mij |2\n2\n2\n4\u03c0 16\u03c0 (x1 x2 s)2\nFi (x1 , \u03ba21,t ) Fj (x2 , \u03ba22,t ) .\n\n(2)\n\nThis formula is very useful to study correlations between the produced heavy\nquark Q and heavy antiquark Q\u0304 [14].\n\n\f4\n\nsqm \u0307szczurek\n\nprinted on October 17, 2018\n\nAt the Tevatron and LHC energies the contribution of the gg \u2192 QQ\u0304\nsubrocess is more than one order of magnitude larger than its counterpart\nfor the q q\u0304 \u2192 QQ\u0304 subprocess. At RHIC energy the relative contribution\nof the q q\u0304 annihilation is somewhat bigger. Therefore in the following we\nshall take into account not only gluon-gluon fusion process but also the\nquark-antiquark annihilation mechanism.\nThe production of electrons/positrons is a multi-step process. The whole\nprocedure of electron/positron production can be written in the following\nschematic way:\nd\u03c3 e\nd\u03c3 Q\n=\n\u2297 DQ\u2192D \u2297 fD\u2192e ,\n(3)\ndyd2 p\ndyd2 p\nwhere the symbol \u2297 denotes a generic convolution. The first term responsible for production of heavy quarks/antiquarks. Next step is the process\nof formation of heavy mesons. We follow a phenomenological approach and\ntake e.g. Peterson [9] and Braaten et al. [10] fragmentation functions with\nparameters from the literature [18]. The electron decay function accounts\nfor the proper branching fractions.\nThe inclusive distributions of hadrons can be obtained through a convolution of inclusive distributions of heavy quarks/antiquarks and Q \u2192 h\nfragmentation functions:\nH\nd\u03c3(y1 , pH\n1t , y2 , p2t , \u03c6)\n\u2248\nH\ndy1 dpH\n1t dy2 dp2t d\u03c6\npH\n\nZ\n\nQ\nDQ\u2192H (z1 ) DQ\u0304\u2192H\u0304 (z2 ) d\u03c3(y1 , pQ\n1t , y2 , p2t , \u03c6)\n*\n*\ndz1 dz2 ,\nQ\nz1\nz2\ndy1 dpQ\n1t dy2 dp2t d\u03c6\n(4)\npH\n\nQ\n1t\n2t\nwhere: pQ\n1t = z1 , p2t = z2 , where meson longitudinal fractions z1 , z2 \u2208\n(0, 1).\nWe use decay functions fitted recently [12] to the CLEO and BABAR\ndata. In our approach the electrons (positrons) are generated isotropically\nin the heavy meson rest frame.\n\n3. Results\n3.1. Single electron spectra\nBefore we start presenting our results for the spectra let us focus for a\nmoment on the decay functions discussed shortly above. In Fig.2 we show\nour fit [12] to the CLEO and BABAR data. The good quality fit of the\ndata will allow us to obtain reliable predictions for electron/positron single\nparticle spectra.\nNow we shall concentrate on transverse momentum distribution of electrons/positrons measured recently by the STAR and PHENIX collaborations at RHIC [1, 2]. In Fig.3, as an example we show results obtained\n\n\fsqm \u0307szczurek\n\nprinted on October 17, 2018\n\n5\n\nFig. 2. Our fit to the CLEO [3] and BABAR [4] data.\n\nwith the Kwieci\u0144ski UPDFs [8]. In Ref.[12] we have discussed in addition\nother UGDFs. Uncertainties due to different combinations of factorization\nand renormalization scales as well as due to different choices fragmentation\nfunctions are shown in Fig.4 In these calculations we have included both\ngluon-gluon fusion as well as quark-antiquark annihilation. In the last case\nwe use matrix elements with on-shell formula but for off-shell kinematics\n(the discussion of this point can be found in our earlier paper [14]). In\nRef.[12] we have discussed also uncertainties due to the choice of quark\nmasses.\nStudy of nonphotonic e\u00b1 and hadron correlations allows to \"extract\"\na fractional contribution of the bottom mesons B/(D + B) as a function\nof electron/positron transverse momentum [19]. Recently the STAR collaboration has extended the measurement of the relative B contribution to\nelectron/positron transverse momenta \u223c 10 GeV [20]. In Fig.5 (Kwieci\u0144ski\nUPDFs) shown are results for different scales and different fragmentation\nfunctions. There is a strong dependence on the factorization and renormalization scale in the case of the Kwieci\u0144ski unintegrated gluon/parton\ndistributions. A slightly better agreement is obtained with the Peterson\nfragmentation functions.\n3.2. Electron-positron correlations\nWhen calculating correlation observables we have included also processes\nshown in Fig.6 and Fig.7. The photon-photon induced processes were first\nincluded in Ref. [13]. The central exclusive diffractive process shown in\nFig.7 was first proposed in Ref.[22].\nIn Fig.8 we show e+ e\u2212 invariant mass distributions calculated with the\n\n\f6\n\nsqm \u0307szczurek\n\nprinted on October 17, 2018\n\nFig. 3. Transverse momentum distribution of electrons/positrons obtained with\nthe Kwieci\u0144ski UPDFs. Different combinations of factorization and renormalization scales are used. We show separately contributions of the gluon-gluon fusion\n(black) and quark-antiquark annihilation (grey). On the left side results with the\nPeterson fragmentation functions and on the right side with BCFY fragmentation\nfunctions.\n\nKwiecinski (left) and KMR (right) UGDFs. One can clearly see that both\nthe Kwiecinski and KMR [21] UGDFs give fairly good description of the\ndata for Me+ e\u2212 > 3 GeV. At small invariant masses the Kwiecinski UGDF\nunderestimates the PHENIX data and the KMR UGDF starts to overestimate the data points below Me+ e\u2212 = 2 GeV.\nIn Fig.9 we show uncertainties related to the contribution of semileptonic\ndecays. Complementary the left panel presents uncertainties due to the\nfactorization scale variation as described in the figure caption. The right\npanel shows uncertainties due to the modification of the heavy quark masses.\nIf the detector can measure both transverse momenta of electron/positron\nand their directions, one can construct a distribution in transverse momentum of the dielectron pair: ~\npt,sum = p~1t + p~2t . Our predictions including the\nsemileptonic decays and Drell-Yan processes are shown in the left panel of\nFig.10. Both processes give rather similar distributions. To our knowledge\nthe distributions of this type were never measured experimentally. The distribution in pt,sum is not only a consequence of gluon transverse momenta\nbut invlolves also fragmentation process and semileptonic decays. With\ngood azimuthal granulation of detectors one could also construct distribution in azimuthal angle between electron and positron.

Conclusions\nWe have calculated inclusive spectra of nonphotonic electrons/positrons\nfor RHIC energy in the framework of the kt -factorization. We have concentrated on the dominant gluon-gluon fusion mechanism and used unintegrated gluon distribution functions from the literature. Special emphasis\nwas devoted to the Kwieci\u0144ski unintegrated gluon (parton) distributions. In\nthis formalism, using unintegrated quark and antiquark distributions, one\ncan calculate in addition the quark-antiquark annihilation process including\ntransverse momenta of initial quarks/antiquarks.\nWhen calculating spectra of charmed (D, D \u2217 ) and bottom (B, B \u2217 )\n\n\f10\n\nsqm \u0307szczurek\n\nprinted on October 17, 2018\n\nmesons we have used Peterson and Braaten et al. fragmentation functions.\nWe have used recent fits to the CLEO and BABAR collaborations data for\ndecay functions of heavy mesons.\nOur results have been confronted with experimental data measured recently by the PHENIX and STAR collaborations at RHIC. A reasonable\ndescription of the data at large transverse momenta of electrons/positrons\nhave been achieved. We have discussed uncertainties related to the choice\nof the factorization and renormalization scales and those related to the fragmentation process. Although the uncertainty bands are rather large, there\nis a missing strength at lower electron/positron transverse momenta.\nWe have discussed also correlations of charmed mesons and dielectrons\nat the energy of recent RHIC experiments. We have calculated the spectra in dielectron invariant mass, in azimuthal angle between electron and\npositron as well as for the distribution in transverse momentum of the pair.\nThe uncertainties due to the choice of UGDFs, choice of the factorization\nand renormalization scales, have been discussed. We have obtained good\ndescription of the dielectron invariant mass distribution measured recently\nby the PHENIX collaboration at RHIC.\nAt RHIC the contribution of electrons from Drell-Yan processes is only\nslightly smaller than that from the semileptonic decays. The distributions\nin azimuthal angle between electron and positron and in the transverse\nmomentum of the dielectron pair from both processes are rather similar.\nIt was found that the distribution in azimuthal angle strongly depends on\ndielectron invariant mass.\nWe have also included exclusive central-diffractive contribution discussed\nrecently in the literature. At the rather low RHIC energy it gives, however,\na very small contribution to the cross section and can be safely ignored.\nThe QED double-elastic, double-inelastic, elastic-inelastic and inelasticelastic processes give individually rather small contribution but when added\ntogether are not negligible especially at low dielectron invariant masses\nwhere some strength is missing.\n\nREFERENCES\n[1] J.
