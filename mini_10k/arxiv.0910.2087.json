The limit only holds in very abstract spaces out of distribution theory\ninvolving complexification and non-local phenomena. We give a very elementary model problem\nshowing the main features of the limit process, as well as a heuristic integral procedure for obtaining a description of the solutions for small \u03b5. Such kind of problems appear in thin shell theory\nwhen the middle surface is elliptic and the shell is fixed by a part of the boundary and free by the\nrest.\n\n1 Introduction\nThe main purpose of this paper is to give general ideas on a kind of singular perturbations arising\nin thin shell theory when the middle surface is elliptic and the shell is fixed by a part of the boundary\nand free by the rest as well as an integral heuristic procedure reducing them to simpler problems. The\nsystem depends drastically on the parameter \u03b5 equal to the relative thickness of the shell. It appears\nthat the \"limit problem\" for \u03b5 = 0 is highly ill-posed. Indeed, the boundary conditions on the free\nboundary are not \"adapted\" to the system of equations; they do not satisfy the Shapiro - Lopatinskii\n(SL hereafter) condition. Roughly speaking, this amounts to some kind of \"transparency\" of the\nboundary conditions, which allow some kind of locally indeterminate oscillations along the boundary,\nexponentially decreasing inside the domain. This pathological behavior is only concerned with \u03b5 = 0.\nIn fact, for \u03b5 > 0 the problem is \"classical\". When \u03b5 is positive but small, the \"determinacy\" of the\noscillations only holds with the help of boundary conditions on other boundaries, as well as the small\nterms coming from \u03b5 > 0.\nIn such kind of situations, the limit problem has no solution within classical theory of partial\ndifferential equations, which is uses distribution theory. It is sometimes possible to prove the convergence of the solutions u\u03b5 towards some limit u0 , but this \"limit solution\" and the topology of the\nconvergence are concerned with abstract spaces not included in the distribution space.\nAfter recalling the SL condition (section 2), we give in section 3 a very simple example of such\na perturbation problem. The geometry of the domain (an infinite strip) allows explicit treatment by\nFourier transform in the longitudinal direction. The inverse Fourier transform within distribution theory is only possible for \u03b5 > 0, whereas for \u03b5 = 0 it is only possible in the framework of analytic\nfunctionals (higly singular and not enjoying localization properties). This example shows the prominent role of components with high frequency; for small \u03b5, the \"smooth parts\" (i. e. with small |\u03be|) of\n\u2217\n\nUniversit\u00e9 Paris Descartes, MAP5, 45-47 Rue des Saints P\u00e8res 75006 Paris, France, Nicolas.Meunier@math-info.univparis5.fr\n\u2020\nUniversity of Pierre et Marie Curie and CNRS, Institut Jean Le Rond D'Alembert, 4, place Jussieu, 75252 Paris, France,\nsanchez@lmm.jussieu.fr\n\n1\n\n\fthe solutions may be neglected with respect to \"singular ones\" (i. e. with large |\u03be|). We also recall\nan example of elliptic Cauchy problem (in fact Hadamard's counter-example) which exhibits some\nrelation with the limit problem.\nIn section 4, we report the heuristic procedure of [EgMeSa07]. In this latter article, we addressed a\nmore complicated problem including a variational structure, somewhat analogous to the shell problem,\nbut simpler, as concerning an equation instead of a system. It is shown that the limit problem contains\nin particular an elliptic Cauchy problem. This problem was handled in both a rigorous (very abstract)\nframework and using a heuristic procedure for exhibiting the structure of the solutions with very small\n\u03b5. The reasons why the solution goes out of the distibution space as \u03b5 goes to 0 are then evident. In\nsection 4 we present a simplified version of the heuristic procedure involving only the essential facts\nof the approximation, which are very much analogous to the method of construction of a parametrix\nin elliptic problems [Ta81], [EgSc97]:\n-Only principal (with higher differentiation order) terms are taken into account.\n-Locally, the coefficients are considered to be constant, their values being frozen at the corresponding points.\n-After Fourier transform (x \u2192 \u03be), terms with small \u03be are neglected with respect to those with\nlarger \u03be (which amounts to taking into account singular parts of the solutions while neglecting smoother\nones). We note that this approximation, aside with the two previous ones, lead to some kind of \"local\nFourier transform\" which we shall use freely in the sequel.\nAnother important ingredient of the heuristics is a previous drastic restriction of the space where\nthe variational problem is handled. In order to search for the minimum of energy, we only take\ninto account functions such that the energy of the limit problem is very small. This is done using\na boundary layer method within the previous approximations, i. e. for large |\u03be|. This leads to an\napproximate simpler formulation of the problem for small \u03b5, where it is apparent that the limit problem\ninvolves a smoothing operator and cannot have a solution within distribution theory.\nIt should prove useful to give an example of a sequence of functions converging to an analytical\nfunctional (but going out of the distribution space, then leading to a \"complexification\" phenomenon).\nIt is known ([Sc50], [GeCh64]) that (direct and inverse) Fourier transform within distribution theory\nis only possible for temperate distributions, not allowing functions with exponential growth at infinity.\nThe space of (direct or inverse) Fourier transform of general distributions is noted Z \u2032 . It is a space\nof analytical functionals: the corresponding test functions are analytical rapidly decreasing functions,\nforming the space Z.\nLet us consider the (non temperate) distribution (or function) \u00fb(\u03be) = cosh(\u03be). The sequence\n(\ncosh(\u03be) if |\u03be| < \u03bb,\n\u03bb\n\u00fb (\u03be) =\n0 otherwise\nconverges to \u00fb in the distribution sense as \u03bb goes to infinity. The inverse Fourier transforms u\u03bb (x)\nconverge in Z \u2032 to the analytical functionnal u(x). The functions \u00fb\u03bb (\u03be) are tempered and their inverse\nFourier transforms are easily computed by hand. It appears that for large \u03bb\nu\u03bb (x) \u2248\n\ne\u03bb 1\n(cos(\u03bbx) + x sin(\u03bbx)).\n2\u03c0 1 + x2\n\nIt is then apparent that u\u03bb (x) consists of a \"nearly periodic\" function with period tending to zero\n1\ne\u03bb\nalong with 1/\u03bb, multiplied by an \"envelop\" defined by 1+x\n2 and by the factor 2\u03c0 . Moreover, it should\nbe noted that the amplitude is exponentially large with respect to the inverse of the period. It is\n2\n\n\f0.01\n\n0.01\n\n0.005\nu3\n\n0\n\n0.005\n0\n\n-0.005\n\n-0.005\n\n-0.01\n\n-0.01\n\n1\n\n-1\n\n0.5\n\n-0.5\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n-0.5\ny1\n\n-0.5\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n-1\n\n1 -1\n\n0\n\n0\n\n-0.5\n\n0.5\n1 -1\n\nFigure 1.1: Normal displacement for \u03b5 = 10\u22123 on the left and for \u03b5 = 10\u22125 on the right\nthen apparent that the limit is an \"extremely singular\" function as the \"graph\" fills the entire plane.\nMoreover, it is clear (and may be rigorously proved [EgMeSa07] that the sequence u\u03bb goes out of the\ndistribution space everywhere, not only in the vicinity of x = 0 as is suggested by the formal inverse\n\u03be 2n\nFourier transform of cosh(\u03be) = \u03a3+\u221e\nn=0 (2n)! , which is\nu(x) = \u03a3+\u221e\nn=0\n\n\u2212i 2n\n\u03b4 (x),\n(2n)!\n\napparently a singularity \"of order infinity\" at the origin. This fact constitutes an example of the property that elements of Z \u2032 can only be tested with analytical test functions, then not enjoying localization\nproperties.\nThe motivation for studying that kind of problems comes from shell theory, see [SaHuSa97],\n[BeMiSa08]. It appears that when the middle surface is elliptic (both principal curvatures have same\nsign) and is fixed by a part \u03930 of the boundary and free by the rest \u03931 , the \"limit problem\" as the\nthickness \u03b5 tends to zero is elliptic, with boundary conditions satisfying SL on \u03930 , and boundary not\nsatisfying SL on \u03931 . Without going into details, which may be found in [MeSa06], [MeSaHuSa07],\n[EgMeSa07] and [EgMeSa09], we show numerical computations taken from [BeMiSa08] of the normal displacement for \u03b5 = 10\u22123 and \u03b5 = 10\u22125 (figures 1.1 on the left and on the right respectively)\nwhen the shell is acted upon by a normal density of forces on a rectangular region of the plane of\nparameters. The most important feature is constituted by large oscillations nearby the free boundary\n\u03931 . It is apparent that, when passing from \u03b5 = 10\u22123 to \u03b5 = 10\u22125 , the amplitude of the oscillations\ngrows from 0.001 to 0.01. The singularities produced by the jump of the applied forces inside the\ndomain is still apparent for \u03b5 = 10\u22123 , not for \u03b5 = 10\u22125 , where only oscillations along the boundary\nare visible. Moreover, the number of such oscillations pass from nearly 3 for \u03b5 = 10\u22123 to nearly 5 for\n\u03b5 = 10\u22125 and is then nearly proportional to log(1/\u03b5). We shall see that all these features agree with\nour theory.\n\n2\n\nThe Shapiro - Lopatinskii condition for boundary conditions of elliptic equations\n\nIn this section, we recall some properties of elliptic PDE, see [AgDoNi59] and [EgSc97] for more\ndetails.\n\n3\n\ny2\n\n\fWe consider a PDE of the form\nP (x, \u2202\u03b1 )u = f (x)\n\n(2.1)\n\nWhere x = (x1 , x2 ) and \u2202\u03b1 = \u2202/\u2202x\u03b1 , \u03b1 = 1, 2, and P is a polynomial of degree 2m in \u2202\u03b1 . Let P0\nbe the \"principal part\", i. e., the terms of higher order. The equation is said to be elliptic at x if the\nhomogeneous polynomial of degree 2m in \u03be\u03b1 :\nP0 (x, \u2212i\u03be\u03b1 ) = 0\n\n(2.2)\n\nhas no solution \u03be = (\u03be1 , \u03be2 ) 6= (0, 0) with real \u03be\u03b1 . When the coefficients are real (this is the only case\nthat we shall consider) this implies that the degree is even (this is the reason why we denoted it by\n2m). The left hand side of (2.2) is said to be the \"principal symbol\"; the \"symbol\" is obtained in an\nanalogous way taking the whole P instead of the principal part P0 . We note that replacing \u2202/\u2202x\u03b1 by\n\u2212i\u03be\u03b1 in P0 amounts to taking formally the Fourier transform x \u2192 \u03be for the homogeneous equation\nwith constant coefficients obtained by discarding the lower order terms and freezing the coefficients\nat x. Obviously, ellipticity on a domain \u03a9 is defined as elliptic at any x \u2208 \u03a9.\nIt is worthwhile mentioning that ellipticity amounts to non - existence of \"travelling waves\" of the\nform\ne\u2212i\u03bex\n(2.3)\nfor the equation obtained after discarding lower order terms and freezing coefficients. Here \"travelling\" amounts to \"with real \u03be\"; note that solutions as (2.3) with non real \u03be are necessarily exponentially\ngrowing or decaying (in modulus) in some direction. Moreover, when a solution of the form (2.3) exists (with \u03be either real or not), it also exists for c\u03be with any c. In a heuristic framework,we may suppose\nthat |\u03be| is very large; this justify to discard lower order terms (= of lower degree in |\u03be|). In the same\n(heuristic) order of ideas, freezing the coefficients allows to consider \"local solutions\". This amounts\nto multiply the solutions by a \"cutoff\" function \u03b8(x) or equivalently taking the convolution of the\nFourier transform with \u03b8\u0302(\u03be), which do not modify the behavior for large \u03be. Microlocal analysis gives\na rigorous sense to that heuristics. It then appears that local singularities of a solution u (associated\nwith behavior of the Fourier transform for large |\u03be|) cannot occur in elliptic equations unless they are\ncontrolled by the (Fourier transform of the) right hand side f . This gives a \"heuristic proof\" of the\nclassical property that local solutions of elliptic equations are rigorously associated with singularities\nof f .\nWhat happens with solutions near the boundary? Local Fourier transform is no longer possible,\nbut, after rectification of the boundary in the neighborhood of a point, we may perform a tangential\nFourier transform. If, for instance, the considered part of the boundary is on the axis x1 and the domain\nis on the side x2 > 0, taking only higher order terms and frozen coefficients, we have solutions of the\nform (2.3) with real \u03be1 (as coming from the Fourier transform) and non - real \u03be2 . The dependence in\nx2 is immediately obtained by solving an ODE with constant coefficients. Obviously, the solutions\nare exponentially growing or decreasing for x2 > 0. As the coefficients are real, there are precisely\nm (linearly independent) growing and m decreasing (in the case of multiple roots, dependence in x2\nof the form x2 e\u03bb)x2 and analogous also occur). Roughly speaking, there are solutions of the form:\nX\nCk e\u2212i\u03be1 x1 e\u03bbk x2\n(2.4)\nk\n\nwith real \u03be1 and Re(\u03bb) 6= 0 (here k is running from 1 to 2m) . Boundary conditions on x2 = 0\nshould control solutions with Re(\u03bb) < 0, i. e., exponentially decreasing inside the domain, whereas\nexponentially growing ones should be controlled \"by the equation in the rest of the domain and the\n4\n\n\fboundary conditions on the other parts of the boundary\". In other words, \"good boundary conditions\"\nshould determine, (within our approximation of the half plane and frozen coefficients) the solutions of\nthe equation of the form (2.4) with Re(\u03bb) < 0. Obviously, the number of such boundary conditions\nis m. A set of m boundary conditions enjoying the above property is said to satisfy the Shapiro Lopatinskii condition. There are several equivalent specific definitions of it. We shall mainly use the\nfollowing one:\nDefinition 2.1. Let P be elliptic at a point O of the boundary. A set of m boundary conditions\nBj (x, \u2202\u03b1 ) = gj (x), j = 1, ...m is said to satisfy the SL condition at O when, after a local change to\nnew coordinates with origin at O and axis x1 tangent to the boundary, taking only the higher order\nterms and coefficients frozen at O in the equation and the boundary conditions, the solutions of the\nform (2.4) with Re(\u03bb) < 0 obtained by formal tangential Fourier transform are well defined by the\nboundary conditions.\nRemark 2.1. The above definition should be understood in the sense of formal solution for any given\n(real and non-zero) \u03be1 . The SL condition is not concerned with solutions in certain spaces. It is purely\nalgebraic, and concerns m conditions imposed to the m (decreasing with x2 ) linearly independent\nsolutions of the ODE obtained from P0 by formal tangential Fourier transform. This also amounts to\nsaying that imposing the boundary conditions equal to zero, the considered solutions must vanish. In\nfact, the SL condition amounts to non-vanishing of a certain determinant, and as so it is generically\nsatisfied: conditions not satisfying it are rarely encountered. In particular, in \"well-behaved problems\", when coerciveness on appropriate spaces is proved, the SL condition is not usually checked.\nIt should also be noted that the SL condition is independent of a change of variables, and, in most\ncases, the change is trivial. On the other hand, there are also definitions of the SL condition without\nchange of variables. Last, it should also be noted that the SL condition has nothing to do with lower\norder terms and the right hand side of the boundary conditions (as ellipticity is only concerned with\nthe principal symbol); it is merely a condition of adequation of the principal part of the boundary\noperators to the principal part of the equation.\nLet us consider, as an exercise, examples for the laplacian.\nP = \u2212\u220212 \u2212 \u220222\n\n(2.5)\n\nThe principal symbol is \u03be12 + \u03be22 so that the equation is elliptic of order 2, then m = 1. \"Good\nboundary conditions\" are in number of 1.\nLet us try the boundary condition (Dirichlet):\nu = 0.\n\n(2.6)\n\nTaking any point of the boundary and (x1 , x2 ) with origin at that point, tangent and normal to the\nboundary respectively, the equation is the same as in the initial variables, and formal tangential Fourier\ntransform gives\n(\u03be12 \u2212 \u220222 )\u00fb(\u03be1 , x2 ) = 0\n(2.7)\nand the solutions are\n\u00fb(\u03be1 , x2 ) = C1 (\u03be1 )e|\u03be1 |x2 + C2 (\u03be1 )e|\u03be1 |x2 .\n\n(2.8)\n\nTaking only the exponentially decreasing for x2 > 0 we only have\n\u00fb(\u03be1 , x2 ) = C1 (\u03be1 )e\u2212|\u03be1 |x2 .\n5\n\n(2.9)\n\n\fNow, imposing the \"tangential Fourier transform\" of (2.6):\n\u00fb(\u03be1 , 0) = 0,\n\n(2.10)\n\nwe see that it vanish identically. Then, the Dirichlet boundary condition satisfies the SL condition for\nthe laplacian.\nThe case of the Neumann boundary condition for the laplacian\n\u2202u\n= 0.\n(2.11)\n\u2202n\n\u2202u\nis analogous. (Note also that the Fourier condition ( \u2202n\n) + au = g is the same, as only the higher\norder terms are taken in consideration). Proceeding as before, we have, instead of (2.10):\n\u22022 \u00fb(\u03be1 , 0) = \u2212|\u03be1 |C1 (\u03be1 ) = 0,\n\n(2.12)\n\nwhich also gives C1 (\u03be1 ) = 0 and then \u00fb = 0. Thus, (2.10) satisfies SL for (2.5).\nOppositely, the boundary condition:\n(\u2202s \u2212 i\u2202n )u = 0,\n\n(2.13)\n\nwhere s and n denote the arc of the boundary and the normal, does not satisfy the SL condition for the\nlaplacian. Indeed, taking the new local axes, s and n become x1 and x2 , and after tangential Fourier\ntransform:\n\u02c6 1 , 0) = 0,\n(\u2212i\u03be1 \u2212 i\u22022 )u)(\u03be\n(2.14)\nwhich, applied to (2.9) becomes:\n(\u2212i\u03be1 + i|\u03be1 |)C1 (\u03be1 ) = 0.\n\n(2.15)\n\nwe then see that C1 (\u03be1 ) vanishes for negative \u03be1 , but is arbitrary for positive \u03be1 . In fact , the boundary\ncondition (2.13) is \"transparent\" for solutions of the form (2.9) with positive \u03be1 .\nRemark 2.2. As it is apparent in the last example, when the SL condition is not satisfied, there is\nsome kind of \"local non-uniqueness\", where \"local\" recalls that only higher order terms are taken in\nconsideration, and the coefficients are frozen at the considered point of the boundary.\nThe SL condition appears as some previous condition for solving elliptic problems. It is apparent\nthat some pathology is involved at points of the boundary where it is not satisfied.\nLet us mention, before closing this section, that the boundary conditions may be different on\ndifferent parts of the boundary specially on different connected components of it (when there are\npoints of junction of the various regions, usually singularities appear at that points).\n\n3 An explicit perturbation problem where the SL condition is not satisfied on a part of the boundary of the limit problem\nLet \u03a9 be the strip (\u2212\u221e, +\u221e) \u00d7 (0, 1) of the (x, y) plan. We denote by \u03930 and \u03931 the boundaries\ny = 0 and y = 1 respectively. We then consider the boundary value problem depending on the\nparameter \u03b5:\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f2 \u25b3u\u03b5 = 0 on \u03a9\nu\u03b5 = 0 on \u03930\n(3.16)\n\uf8f3\n2\n\u2202x u + (i + \u03b5 )\u2202y u = \u03c6 on \u03931\n6\n\n\fwhere \u03c6 is the data of the problem. It is a given function of x, that we shall suppose sufficiently\nsmooth, tending to 0 at infinity. We shall solve it by x \u2192 \u03be Fourier transform; it is easily seen that we\nalso have automatically u \u2192 0 for x \u2192 \u221e, which may be added to the boundary conditions.\nThe boundary condition on \u03930 is the Dirichlet one, which satisfies SL for the laplacian. Oppositely,\nthe boundary condition on \u03931 satisfies it for \u03b5 > 0 (this is easily checked), not at the limit \u03b5 = 0 (see\nthe end of the previous section). The problem is to solve for \u03b5 > 0 and to study the behavior for \u03b5\ngoing to zero.\nDenoting by\u02c6the x \u2192 \u03be Fourier transform, \u00fb\u03b5 is defined on the same \u03a9 domain, but of the (\u03be, y)\nplane. The solutions of the (transform of) equation and the boundary condition on \u03930 are of the form\n\u00fb\u03b5 (\u03be, y) = \u03b1(\u03be) sinh(\u03bey)\n\n(3.17)\n\nwhere \u03b1 denotes an unknown function to be determined with the boundary condition on \u03931 . It will\nprove useful to write the solution under the form\n\u00fb\u03b5 (\u03be, y) = \u03b2\u0302 \u03b5 (\u03be)\n\nsinh(\u03bey)\nsinh(\u03be)\n\n(3.18)\n\nfor the new unknown \u03b2\u0302 \u03b5 (\u03be), which is the transform of the trace u\u03b5 (x, 0). Imposing the Fourier transform of the boundary condition on \u03931 we have:\n\u2212 i\u03be \u03b2\u0302 \u03b5 (\u03be) + (i + \u03b52 )\nSo that:\n\u03b2\u0302 \u03b5 (\u03be) =\n\ncosh(\u03be) \u03b5\n\u03b2\u0302 (\u03be)\u03be = \u03c6\u0302(\u03be).\nsinh(\u03be)\n\n\u03c6\u0302(\u03be)\n\u0011\n.\n\u2212i\u03be 1 \u2212 coth(\u03be) + \u03b52 \u03be coth(\u03be)\n\u0010\n\n(3.19)\n\n(3.20)\n\nIn order to study this function, we should keep in mind that the expression (1 \u2212 coth(\u03be)) decays for\n\u03be \u2192 +\u221e as 2e\u22122\u03be . Then, at the limit \u03b5 = 0 we have\n\u03b2\u0302 0 (\u03be) =\n\n\u03c6\u0302(\u03be)\n.\n\u2212i\u03be(1 \u2212 coth(\u03be))\n\n(3.21)\n\n\u03c6\u0302(\u03be) 2\u03be\ne .\n\u2212i\u03be\n\n(3.22)\n\nFor \u03be \u2192 +\u221e this function behaves as\n\u03b2\u0302 0 (\u03be) \u2248 2\n\nThis shows (unless in the case of very special data \u03c6 with very fast decaying Fourier transform) that\n\u03b2\u0302 0 (\u03be) is not a tempered distribution, and the inverse Fourier transform is an analytical function in Z \u2032 .\nNevertheless, for \u03b5 > 0, \u03b2\u0302 \u03b5 (\u03be) is \"well-behaved\" for \u03be \u2192 +\u221e as\n\u03b2\u0302 \u03b5 (\u03be) \u2248\nThis specific behavior depends on that of\n\n\u03c6\u0302\n\u03be,\n\n\u03c6\u0302(\u03be)\n.\n\u03be\u03b52\n\n(3.23)\n\nso that in most cases will be decreasing, but multiplied\n\n\u03b5\u22122 .\n\nby the factor\nWhen \u03b5 > 0 (small but not 0) is fixed, \u03b2\u0302 \u03b5 (\u03be) is approximatively given by (3.21)\nfor \"finite\" \u03be and by (3.23) for \u03be going to +\u221e. It is easily seen that the sup in modulus of |\u03b2\u0302 \u03b5 (\u03be)| is\n\n7\n\n\flocated in the region where both terms in the denominator of the right hand side of (3.20) are of the\nsame order (so that no one of them may ble neglected). This gives\n\u03be = O(log(1/\u03b5)).\n\n(3.24)\n\nIt appears that \u03b2\u0302 \u03b5 (\u03be) consists mainly of Fourier components which tend to infinity algebraically\nas \u03b5 goes to zero with \u03be tending to infinite \"slowly\" as in (3.24). this is somewhat analogous to the\nexample, given in the introduction, of a sequence of functions converging to an analytical functional.\nComing back to (3.18), the main properties of the behavior of u\u03b5 (x, 1) may be thrown:\n- The trace u\u03b5 (x, 1) = \u03b2 \u03b5 (x) on the boundary \u03931 which bears the \"pathological boundary condition\" mainly consists of large oscillations with wave length 1/ log(1/\u03b5) (which tends to 0 very slowly\nas \u03b5 \u2192 0). The amplitude of that oscillations grows nearly as \u03b5\u22122 . The limit \u03b5 \u2192 0 does not exist in\ndistribution theory; it constitutes a complexification process.\n- Out of the trace on \u03931 , (i. e. for 0 < y < 1), the behavior is analogous, but of lower amplitude,\nwhich is exponentially decreasing going away of \u03931 . We recover properties of the non-uniqueness\nassociated with the failed SL condition.\nBefore concluding this section, we would like to show some analogy between the previous limit\nproblem and the Cauchy elliptic problem, which is a classical example of ill-posed problem, without\nsolution in general.\nWe consider the same domain \u03a9 as before, but we now impose two boundary conditions on \u03930\nand no condition on \u03931 .

Let a and b be the bilinear forms\ngiven by:\nZ\n\u25b3u \u25b3v dx,\n(4.27)\na(u, v) =\n\u03a9\n\nb(u, v) =\n\nZ\n\n2\nX\n\n\u03a9 \u03b1,\u03b2=1\n\n8\n\n\u2202\u03b1\u03b2 u \u2202\u03b1\u03b2 v dx.\n\n(4.28)\n\n\fWe consider the following variational problem (which has possibly only a formal sense)\n\u001a\nFind u\u03b5 \u2208 V such that, \u2200v \u2208 V\na(u\u03b5 , v) + \u03b52 b(u\u03b5 , v) = hf, vi,\n\n(4.29)\n\nwhere the space V is the \"energy space\" with the essential boundary conditions on \u03930\nV = {v \u2208 H 2 (\u03a9); v|\u03930 =\n\n\u2202v\n= 0},\n\u2202n |\u03930\n\n(4.30)\n\nwhere n, t denotes the normal and tangent unit vectors to the boundary \u0393 with the convention that the\nnormal vector n is inwards \u03a9. It is easily checked that the bilinear form b is coercive on V . Moreover,\nwe immediately obtain the following result. For all \u03b5 > 0 and for all f in V \u2032 , the variational problem\n(4.29) is of Lax-Milgram type and it is a self-adjoint problem which has a coerciveness constant larger\nthan c\u03b52 , with c > 0.\nThe equation on \u03a9 associated with problem (4.29) is:\n(1 + \u03b52 )\u25b32 u\u03b5 = f on \u03a9,\n\n(4.31)\n\nas both forms a and b give the laplacian. As for the boundary conditions on \u03930 , they are \"principal\"\ni. e. they are included in the definition of V , (5.4). As for conditions on \u03931 , they are \"natural\",\nclassically obtained from the integrated terms by parts. Those coming from the form b are somewhat\ncomplicated; we shall not write them, as the problem with \u03b5 > 0 is classical. For \u03b5 = 0 these\nconditions (coming from form a) are: \u25b3u = \u2202\u25b3u\n\u2202n = 0, on \u03931 .\nAs a matter of fact, the full limit boundary boundary value problem is:\n\uf8f1 2 0\n\u25b3 u = f on \u03a9\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n0\n\uf8f2\nu = \u2202u\n\u2202n = 0, on \u03930\n(4.32)\n\uf8f4\n\u25b3u0 = 0 on \u03931\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\n\u2202\n\u25b3u0 = 0 on \u03931 .\n\u2212 \u2202n\n\nLet us check that the boundary conditions on \u03931 (i. e; the two last lines of (5.6)) do not satisfy\nthe SL condition for the elliptic operator \u25b32 . Indeed, proceeding as in sect. 2, by formal tangential\nFourier transform\n(\u2212\u03be12 + \u220222 )2 \u00fb = 0.\n\n(4.33)\n\nv\u0302 = (Ae\u2212|\u03be1 |x2 + Cx2 e\u2212|\u03be1 |x2 )\n\n(4.34)\n\nwhich yields that\n(as well as analogous terms with +|\u03be| instead of \u2212|\u03be|, which are not taken into account as exponentially growing inwards the domain). Here, according to SL theory, x2 is the coordinate normal to the\nboundary, after taking locally tangent and normal axes, (which do not modify the equation \u25b32 ). The\n(tangential Fourier transform of the) boundary conditions on \u03931 are:\n(\u2212\u03be12 + \u220222 )\u00fb = 0\n\n(4.35)\n\n\u22022 (\u2212\u03be12 + \u220222 )\u00fb = 0.\n\n(4.36)\n\nand\n\n9\n\n\fIt is immediately seen that the previous solutions (4.34) with C = 0 and any A 6= 0 satisfy both\nconditions (note that its laplacian vanishes everywhere, then it vanishes as well as its normal derivative\non the boundary). So, the SL condition is not satisfied on \u03931 .\nBefore going on with our study, we note that the limit problem (4.32) implies an elliptic Cauchy\nproblem for the auxiliary unknown\nv 0 = \u25b3u0 .\n(4.37)\nIndeed, system (4.32) gives in particular:\n\uf8f1\n0\n\uf8f2 \u25b3v = f on \u03a9\nv 0 = 0 on \u03931\n\uf8f3 \u2202v0\n\u2212 \u2202n = 0 on \u03931 .\n\n(4.38)\n\nwhich is precisely the Cauchy problem for the laplacian.\nAs mentioned in section 3, this is a classical ill - posed problem, and the solution does not exist\nin general. Oppositely, uniqueness of the solution holds true (uniqueness theorem of Holmgren and\nanalogous, see for instance [CoHi62]).\n\n4.2 The heuristic integral approach\nThe aim of this section is the construction, in a heuristic way, of an approximate description of the\nsolutions u\u03b5 of the model problem in the previous section for small values of \u03b5.\nFrom the general theory of singular perturbations of the form (4.29), we know that our assumption\na(v, v)1/2 defines a norm on V,\n\n(4.39)\n\nis crucial. Indeed, when it is not satisfied, the problem is said to be \"non inhibited\". In such a case, it\nhas a kernel which contains non vanishing terms and then, it is easy to establish that the asymptotic\nbehaviour of the solution u\u03b5 of (4.29) is described by a variational problem in this kernel. The previous\nfact is not surprising as soon as we consider the following minimization problem, which is equivalent\nto (4.29),\n\u001a\nMinimize in V,\n(4.40)\na(u\u03b5 , u\u03b5 ) + \u03b52 b(u\u03b5 , u\u03b5 ) \u2212 2hf, u\u03b5 i.\nIndeed, when \u03b5 goes to zero, the natural trend consists in avoiding the a-energy which occurs with the\nfactor 1 and leaving the b-energy which has a factor \u03b52 .\nClearly, this is not possible when (4.39) is satisfied since the kernel reduces to the zero function.\n\u2202v\nvanish\nNevertheless, in our case, a(v, v) = 0 implies \u25b3v = 0 and, as v \u2208 V , the traces of v and \u2202n\non \u03930 , so that (4.39) follows from the uniqueness theorem for the Cauchy problem. This uniqueness\nis classical, but the solution u is unstable in the sense that there can be \"large u\" in the V norm (or\nin other spaces) for \"small f \" in the V \u2032 norm (or in other spaces). It then appears that the same\nreasoning shows that for small values of \u03b5, the solution u\u03b5 will be precisely among elements with\nsmall a(u\u03b5 , u\u03b5 ), that is to say with small \u25b3u\u03b5 in L2 .\n\n4.3 The \u03930 layer\nLet us now build such functions u\u03b5 \u2208 V with very smallk\u25b3u\u03b5 kL2 . The main idea is to consider\nfunctions in a larger space than the space of functions v of V such that \u25b3v = 0 (which only contains\nthe function v = 0). The functions of this bigger space will not satisfy the two boundary conditions\n10\n\n\fon \u03930 that are satisfied by any function of V . Then we shall modify it in a narrow boundary layer\nalong \u03930 in order to satisfy the two boundary conditions with small value of a-energy.\nMore precisely, let us consider the vector space:\nG0 = {v \u2208 C \u221e (\u03a9), \u25b3v = 0 on \u03a9, v = 0 on \u03930 }.\n\n(4.41)\n\nRemark 4.1. We observe that every function of G0 satisfies one of the boundary conditions on \u03930\nwhich are satisfied by any element of V . For simplicity, we have chosen v = 0 on \u03930 , but we could\n\u2202v\n= 0 on \u03930 as well. On the other hand, the regularity assumption C \u221e is\nchoose the other one \u2202n\nslightly arbitrary. Since, we will consider the completion of G0 with respect to some norm, this point\nis irrelevant.\nObviously, as the Dirichlet problem for the laplacian on \u03a9 is well posed in C \u221e , the space G0 is\nisomorphic with the space of traces on \u03931 :\n{w \u2208 C \u221e (\u03931 )}\nthe isomorphism is obtained by solving the Dirichlet problem:\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f2 \u25b3w\u0303 = 0 on \u03a9,\nw\u0303 = 0 on \u03930 ,\n\uf8f3\nw\u0303 = w on \u03931 .\n\n(4.42)\n\n(4.43)\n\nIn the sequel, we shall consider indifferently the functions w\u0303 on \u03a9 or their traces w on \u03931 .\nIn fact, the exact function u\u03b5 is a solution of (4.31), which we are searching to describe approximatively in order to define a space as small as possible (incorporating the main features of the solution)\nto solve the minimization problem. More precisely, according to our previous comments, we are interested in the \"most singular parts\" of u\u03b5 in the sense of the part corresponding to the high frequency\nFourier components. As we shall see in the sequel, it turns out that these singular parts may be obtained by modification of the functions w\u0303 on a boundary layer close to \u03930 ; this layer is narrower when\nthe considered Fourier components are of higher frequency; in fact, the layer only exists because we\nonly consider high frequencies. This allows to make an approximation which consists in using locally\ncurvilinear coordinates defined by the arc of \u03930 and the normal, and handling them as cartesian coordinates. Clearly, this approximation is exact only on the very \u03930 , but more and more precise as we\napproach of \u03930 , i. e. as the considered frequencies grow.\nOnce the layer is constructed, we compute the a-energy of it, as well as the \u03b52 b-energy of the\n(modified) w\u0303 function, in order to consider the variational problem (4.29) in the restricted space.\nLet us first exhibit the local structure of the Fourier transform of w\u0303 close to \u03930 . According to\nour general considerations on the heuristic procedure, \u0175 may be considered (after multiplying by an\nappropriate cutoff function) of \"small support\" near a point P0 of \u03930 . Taking local tangent and normal\ncartesian coordinates y1 , y2 , we have, within our approximation,\n\u0010 \u22022\n\u22022 \u0011\n+\nw\u0303 = 0 on R \u00d7 (0, t),\n\u2202y12 \u2202y22\n\n(4.44)\n\nF(w\u0303j )(\u03be1 , y2 ) = \u03bbe|\u03be1 |y2 + \u03bce\u2212|\u03be1 |y2 .\n\n(4.45)\n\nfor some t > 0. Taking the tangential Fourier transform, we obtain:\n\nIt is worthwhile defining the local structure of \u0175 in the vicinity of \u03930 using the \"Cauchy\" data w\u0303 and\n\u22022 w\u0303 on \u03930 (note that the solution of the Cauchy problem is unique, so that the Cauchy data determine\n11\n\n\fthe solution). As \u0175 vanishes on \u03930 , the local structure is then determined by \u22022 w\u0303 on \u03930 . Taking the\ntangential Fourier transform this gives:\n\u0010 \u2202 w\u0303\n\u0010 \u0011\n\u0011 sinh(|\u03be |y )\nj\n1 2\nF w\u0303j (\u03be1 , y2 ) = F\n.\n\u2202y2 |y2 =0\n|\u03be1 |\n\n(4.46)\n\nWe now proceed to the modification of w\u0303 into w\u0303a in a narrow boundary layer of \u03930 in order\nto satisfy (always within our approximation) the equation coming from (4.31) for small \u03b5.

Since |\u03be1 | >> 1, then |\u03be1 |y2 >> 1 means that y2 >> |\u03be11 | (but we still impose\nthat y2 is small in order to be in a narrow layer of \u03930 ); this is perfectly consistent, as we will only\nuse the functions for large |\u03be1 |, hence the terms with\n\u03b2 and \u03b4 are \"boundary layer terms\"\n\u0011\n\u0010 coefficients\n1\ngoing to zero out of the layer (i.e. for |y2 | >> O |\u03be1 | ), see perhaps [Ec79] or [Il91] for generalities\non boundary layers and matching.

As the given \u1e7d and w\u0303 are harmonic in \u03a9, the a-form is only concerned with the modification\nterms \u03b4\u1e7d and \u03b4w\u0303. Then, within our approximation, we have:\nZ\nZ +\u221e\na\na\ndy1\na(\u1e7d , w\u0303 ) =\n\u25b3(\u03b4\u1e7d)\u25b3(\u03b4w\u0303) dy2 .\n(4.55)\n\u03930\n\n0\n\nTo compute this expression, we first write \u1e7d and w\u0303 as sum of terms with \"small support\" (by\nmultiplying by a partition of unity): \u1e7d = \u03a3j \u1e7dj and w\u0303 = \u03a3j w\u0303j . Then, within our approximation,\nthe integral is on the halfplane R \u00d7 (0, +\u221e) of the variables y1 , y2 .

Obviously, the a-energy\nshould be computed using formula (4.58). This modified problem should involve the a-energy and\nthe \u03b52 b-energy. A natural space for handling it should be the completion G of G0 with the norm:\nZ\n2\n\u2202 \u2202v\nP( )\nkvk2G =\nds + b(v, v).\n(4.59)\n\u2202s \u2202n |\u03930\n\u03930\nIt is easily seen that G is the space of the harmonic functions of H 2 (\u03a9) vanishing on \u03930 ; according\nto (4.43) it may be identified with the space of traces H 3/2 (\u03931 ).\nIt will prove useful to write another (asymptotically equivalent for large |\u03be1 |) definition of this\nproblem. Indeed, the elements w\u0303 of G0 (and then of G) may be identified (by solving the problem\n13\n\n\f(4.43)) with their traces w on \u03931 . Moreover, as the functions w\u0303 are harmonic, we may exhibit their\nlocal behavior in the vicinity of any point x0 \u2208 \u03931 . Proceeding as in (4.44), (4.45) and taking only the\ndecreasing exponential towards the domain (this is the classical approximation for the construction of\na parametrix) we have:\nF(w\u0303)(\u03be1 , y2 ) = F(w)(\u03be1 )e\u2212|\u03be1 |y2 ,\n(4.60)\nwhere y1 , y2 are the tangent and the normal (inwards the domain) vectors. Then, it is apparent that\nthe b-energy is concentrated in a layer close to \u03931 and we may compute it in an analogous way to the\ncalculus that was done for the a-energy (4.58). Indeed, using Parseval-Plancherel Theorem and within\nour approximation, we have\nZ +\u221e X\nZ +\u221e\ndy1\n|\u2202\u03b1\u03b2 w\u0303|2 dy2\n(4.61)\nb(w\u0303, w\u0303) =\n0\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\n=\n\nZ\n\n+\u221e\n\nd\u03be1\n\u2212\u221e\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n\u03b1,\u03b2\n+\u221e \u0010\n\u03be14 |F(w\u0303)|2\n\n+ 2\u03be12 |F(\n\n\u2202 w\u0303 2\n\u2202 2 w\u0303 \u0011\n)| + |F( 2 )|2 dy2 ,\n\u2202y2\n\u2202y2\n\nhence, recalling (4.60) and integrating over y2 , we get:\nZ +\u221e\nb(w\u0303, w\u0303) = 2\n|\u03be1 |3 |F(w)|2 d\u03be1 .\n\n(4.62)\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\n\u2202\nThen, defining the pseudo-differential operator Q( \u2202s\n) of order 3/2 with principal symbol\n\n\u221a\nor equivalently as previously:\n\n\u221a\n\n2|\u03be1 |3/2 ,\n\n(4.63)\n\n2(1 + |\u03be1 |2 )3/4 ,\n\n(4.64)\n\nwe have (always within our approximation):\nb(\u1e7d, w\u0303) =\n\nZ\n\n\u03931\n\nQ(\n\n\u2202\n\u2202\n)v Q( )w ds.\n\u2202s\n\u2202s\n\n(4.65)\n\nWe observe that the operator Q is only concerned with the trace on \u03931 , so that we may either write\n\u1e7d, w\u0303 or v, w in (4.65).\nThe formal asymptotic problem becomes:\n(\nFind \u1e7d \u03b5 \u2208 G such that \u2200w\u0303 \u2208 G\nR\nR\n(4.66)\n\u2202 w\u0303\n\u2202 \u1e7d\u03b5\n2\n\u03b5\n\u03930 P ( \u2202n )P ( \u2202n ) ds + \u03b5 \u03931 Q(\u1e7d ) Q(w\u0303) ds = hf, wi.\n\n4.5 The formal asymptotics and its sensitive behaviour\n\nIn order to exhibit more clearly the unusual character of the problem, we shall now write (4.66)\nunder another equivalent form involving only the traces on \u03931 . Coming back to (4.43), let us define\nw\u0303\nR0 as follows. For a given w \u2208 C \u221e (\u03931 ) we solve (4.43) and we take the trace of \u2202\u2202n\non \u03930 , then\n\u2202 w\u0303\n= R0 w.\n\u2202n |\u03930\n\n14\n\n(4.67)\n\n\fUsing the regularity properties of the solution of (4.43), it follows that R0 w is in C \u221e (\u03930 ). In fact,\nR0 is a smoothing operator, sending any distribution into a C \u221e function. Then, (4.66) may be written\nas a problem for the traces on \u03931 :\n(\nFind v \u03b5 \u2208 H 3/2 (\u03931 ) such that \u2200w \u2208 H 3/2 (\u03931 )\nR\nR\nR\n(4.68)\n\u2202\n\u2202\n\u03b5 P ( \u2202 )R w ds + \u03b52\n\u03b5 Q( \u2202 )w ds =\nP\n(\n)R\nv\nQ(\n)v\n0\n0\n\u2202s\n\u2202s\n\u2202s\n\u2202s\n\u03930\n\u03931\n\u03a9 F w\u0303 dx,\nwhere the configuration space is obviously H 3/2 (\u03931 ). The left hand side with \u03b5 > 0 is continuous\nand coercive. We then define the new operators\nA = R\u22170 P \u2217 P R0 \u2208 L(H s (\u03931 ), H r (\u03930 )), \u2200s, r \u2208 R,\n\u2217\n\nB = Q Q \u2208 L(H\n\n3/2\n\n(\u03931 ), H\n\n\u22123/2\n\n(\u03931 )\n\nwhere R\u22170 is the adjoint of R0 (which is also smoothing)), (4.68) becomes\n\u0011\n\u0010\nA + \u03b52 B v \u03b5 = F, in H \u22123/2 (\u03931 ).\n\n(4.69)\n(4.70)\n\n(4.71)\n\nObviously, B is an elliptic pseudo-differential operator of order 3, whereas A is a smoothing (non\nlocal) operator.\nThis problem is somewhat simpler than the initial one (as on a manifold of dimension 1), showing the interest of the formal asymptotics. It enters in a class of sensitive problems addressed in\n[EgMeSa07] section 2. It is apparent that the limit problem (for \u03b5 = 0) has no solution in the distribution space for any F not contained in C \u221e . Indeed, on the compact manifold \u03930 , any distribution is\nin some H \u2212m (\u03930 ) space, which is send into C \u221e by the smoothing operator A.\nRemark 4.2. The drastically non local character of the smoothing operator A follows from the fact\nthat it involves R0 and R\u22170 (see(4.67)). This is the reason why the problem may be reduced to another\none on the traces on \u03931 . The possibility of that reduction is a consequence of our approximation,\nwhere the configuration space is formed by harmonic functions.\n\nReferences\n[AgDoNi59] S. Agmon, A. Douglis and L.
