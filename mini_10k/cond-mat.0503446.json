Recently, optical techniques have been proposed to control the spin-spin coupling and realize twoqubit quantum gates.1,2,3,4,5,6,7 The optical method suggests the possibility of an ultrafast control of the qubits.\nThe flexibility in the control that can be obtained by\npulse shaping8 and the absence of noisy contacts represent additional advantages. On the experimental side,\nensemble optical measurements have demonstrated the\nproduction of spin entanglement for impurities embedded in a semiconductor host.9 More recently, the measurement of the quantum state of a single impurity spin\nobtained by coupling it to a single exciton in a quantum dot (QD) has been experimentally carried out.10 In\nthis paper we study theoretically the control of impurity\nspin states when the interaction among them is controlled\nby optically-generated excitons in a QD. We analyze the\ncontrol errors due to the radiative recombination of the\nexciton that mediates the interaction between the spins.\nMoreover, we illustrate how the control parameters can\nbe obtained directly from simple analytical expressions.\nThe method is applied to design the control parameters\nin the production of maximal spin entanglement.\n\nII.\n\nSYSTEM\n\nThe physical system consists of two impurity spins\nplaced close or inside a QD in such a way that there\nis not a direct interaction between them. A schematic\npicture is given in Fig. 1. By coding the qubit in more\nthan one spin efficient schemes for fault-tolerant11 and\nexchange-only12 quantum computation can be naturally\napplied to this setup. Dots of different size provide the\nfrequency selectivity to address specific spin pairs and\nrealize two-qubit readouts. The model we use contains\nfew parameters describing the exciton-light and excitonimpurity coupling and can be applied to different physical\nsystems. For instance, it can be used for excitons localized by monolayer fluctuation in III-V and II-VI quantum\nwells and interacting with a finite number of localized\nimpurities as in Ref. 9. III-V or Si/Ge self-assembled\n\nLight\nQD\n(off resonance)\n\nQD (resonant)\n\nX\n\nImpurity spins\n\nFIG. 1: Scheme the system: localized spins located near self\nassembled QDs are coupled by an exciton created by a laser\npulse. Dots of different size provide selective control and readout.\n\nQDs can also be used as shown in Fig. 1. For typical\nsemiconductor systems we can restrict the analysis to\nheavy-hole excitons due to the splitting between heavyhole and light-hole bands in the dot. The heavy-hole\nexciton spans a four dimensional space consisting of two\noptically-active and two dark states. We treat the interaction between the electromagnetic field and the excitons\nsemiclassically, and we consider spin states that interact only with the photoexcited electron in the dot. This\nis the case for instance of donor impurity spins in typical semiconductors because the electron-hole exchange is\nmuch smaller than the electron-electron exchange. Notice that by using circularly polarized light the exciton\ninduces, besides the spin-spin coupling, also a local effective magnetic field on the spins.1,13 This effective magnetic field can be controlled by the laser polarization and\ndisappears for linearly polarized light. We will consider\nbelow the case of circularly polarized light.\nThe exciton-spin part of the Hamiltonian can be written as\nH0 = \u01ebN \u2212 2V (J 2 \u2212 S 2 \u2212 L2 )\n\n(1)\n\nwhere S is the total spin of the two impurities (h\u0304 = 1) and\n\u01eb is the energy of the exciton in the dot. The operators N\nand L are defined as N = b\u2020\u2191 b\u2191 +b\u2020\u2193 b\u2193 , Lx = 21 (b\u2020\u2193 b\u2191 +b\u2020\u2191 b\u2193 ),\nLy = 2i (b\u2020\u2193 b\u2191 \u2212 b\u2020\u2191 b\u2193 ) and Lz = 21 (b\u2020\u2193 b\u2193 \u2212 b\u2020\u2191 b\u2191 ) . b\u2020\u2193 creates an optically active exciton with electron spin \u22121/2\n\n\f2\nIII.\n\nn=1\nJz=-1/2 Jz=1/2\n\nJz=-3/2 Jz=-1/2 Jz=1/2 Jz=3/2\nJ=1/2\nj\n\nJ=1/2\n\nJ=3/2\n\nn=0\nS\n\nT-1\n\nT0\n\nT1\n\nFIG. 2: Energy level diagram and optical selection rules for\n\u03c3+ polarized light. In n = 1, the total splitting is j = 6V .\n\nand hole spin +3/2, while b\u2020\u2191 creates a dark state exciton with electron spin +1/2 and hole spin +3/2. The\ntotal angular momentum Ji = Li + Si , and V is the exchange interaction between the impurity spins and the\nphotoexcited electron in the dot. The strength and the\nsign of V depend on the system. For instance, this coupling is expected to be ferromagnetic for electrons in the\ndot interacting with localized rare-earth magnetic impuritites, while it is antiferromagnetic for a dot mediating\nthe interaction between shallow donors.1,5 Without loss\nof generality, we will assume V > 0 below. The coupling\nof the excitons in the QD and the external laser field is\ngiven by\nH (LX) =\n\n\u03a9(t) \u2212i\u03c9t \u2020\ne\nb\u2193 + hc\n2\n\n(2)\n\nwhere \u03a9(t) is the time-dependent Rabi energy associated\nwith the optical pulses, and \u03c9 is the energy of the laser.\nWe consider only anti-clockwise polarization (\u03c3+ ) which\ngenerates excitons with electron and hole spin states\n\u22121/2 and +3/2, respectively. Excitons with hole spin\n\u22123/2 are not included in the model since they are not\nexcited by \u03c3+ light and the impurity spins can only flip\nthe spin of the photoexcited electron.\nA scheme of the relevant energy levels is given in Fig.\n2. In the ground state n = 0 we have the singlet and the\ntriplet states corresponding to the two non-interacting\nimpurities. In the excited state n = 1, the electron in\nthe dot splits the triplet states in a quadruplet J = 3/2\nand a doublet J = 1/2. The total Hilbert space is thus\nspanned by a total of 12 states. The arrows in the scheme\nidentify the selection rules for \u03c3+ optical transitions. The\ntransitions have different oscillator strengths, which are\ncalculated using the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. Notice\nthat the light does not connect directly states with different spin S. The structure of the energy levels provides a\nnatural readout scheme for the coded logical qubit |0L i,\n|1L i in the exchange-only scheme.12 An optical setup similar to the one for single spin readout10 could be used: a\nsingle peak at \u01eb corresponds to |0L i while two peaks separated by 6V correspond to the logical state |1L i.\n\nQUANTUM CONTROL\n\nIn order to illustrate how to design the optical control we consider the production of maximal spin entanglement. We choose the the initial state | \u2191\u2193i \u2297 |0i as\nthe tensor product of a linear superposition of impurity states {|Si, |T0 i}, and the exciton |0i representing\nan empty QD. We consider separately the case of infinite\nand finite \u03b3 \u22121 , i.e. spontaneous radiative recombination\nlifetime for the exciton in the dot. In the first case we\ndetermine analitically the control parameters that provide maximal spin entanglement. In the second case, we\nsolve numerically the master equation for the full system\nin Fig. 2. This will allow us to analyze errors due both\nto the radiative recombination and to the finite probability of remaining with an exciton in the dot at the end\nof a pulse. The latter is an error similar to a double\noccupancy error in the case of spins controlled by gate\nvoltages14. Ideally, the QD must be empty at the end\nof each optical pulse, and this can be achieved by an\nadiabatic evolution, or by a nonadiabatic evolution plus\nadditional conditions in the pulse area15 .\n\nA.\n\nInfinite radiative lifetime\n\nWe first analyze the ideal case of a nonadiabatic evolution at \u03b3 = 0. We call nonadiabatic the evolution that\nfollows from a laser resonant with at least one transition\nbetween the n = 0 and n = 1 subspaces in Fig. 2. This\nimplies that there is a substantial exchange of energy\nbetween the electromagnetic field and the dot, which in\nturn results in a significant population inversion during\nthe pulse. Using a numerical simulation we illustrate in\nFig. 3 the evolution of the |Si and |T0 i populations under\na Gaussian pulse giving a Rabi energy of the form,\n2\n\u03a9\n\u03a9(t) = \u221a e\u2212(t/\u03c4 ) .\n\u03c0\n\n(3)\n\nThe pulse is resonant with the bare exciton energy, which\nin the scheme of Fig. 2 corresponds to a resonant transition for the singlet state. In order to have no excitonic\npopulation at the end of the pulse, we need the pulse area\nfor the resonant excitation to be multiple of 2\u03c0, therefore\n\u03a9 and \u03c4 are chosen so that the pulse area is \u03a9\u03c4 = 8\u03c0. Notice that the population of the ground state singlet |Si\nis completely depleted during the pulse but at the end\ncomes back to the original population (0.5). In contrast,\nthe triplet (|T0 i) population follows an adiabatic evolution due to the exchange interaction affecting the optical\nresonance. In Fig. 3 (inset) we show the real and imaginary part of the coherence hS|\u03c1|T0 i. In order to create\nthe maximally entangled state we need a \u00b1\u03c0/2 phase in\nthis matrix element and the chosen optical pulse achieves\nthis goal. This relative phase transforms, for example,\nthe state | \u2191\u2193i into 2\u22121/2 (|Si + i|T0 i) \u221d | \u2191\u2193i + i| \u2193\u2191i.\nFor a given value of the exchange coupling V and pulse\n\n\f3\nwidth \u03c4 , the maximum intensity of the field \u03a9 in Eq. (3)\nis found from the roots of the equation\n\u03c6T (\u03a9, V, \u03c4 ) \u00b1 \u03c0/2 = 0\n\n0.5\n\n(4)\n\nR\u221e\nwhere \u03c6T = \u2212\u221e \u03bb0T (t) dt is the dynamic phase that the\nstate |T0 i picks up following the adiabatic evolution. Notice that since the pulse is a multiple of 2\u03c0 the singlet\nwill only pick up a trivial phase (\u00b11). \u03bb0T is the eigenvalue satisfying \u03bb0T (\u00b1\u221e) = 0 for a 3-level Hamiltonian\nrepresenting the triplet states,\nq\nq\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f9\n2\n1\n\u03a9(t)\n\u03a9(t)\n0\n3\n3\n\uf8fa\nq\n1\uf8ef\n\uf8ef 2\n\uf8fa\n2\nHT (t) = \uf8ef 3 \u03a9(t) 2\u03b4 \u2212 3 j\n\uf8fa .

(8).\nB.\n\nFinite radiative lifetime\n\nIn order to determine how this control scheme is affected by the finite lifetime of the exciton in the dot we\n\n\f4\nintroduce a finite value for \u03b3, and solve the master equation \u03c1\u0307 = \u2212i[H, \u03c1]+L[\u03c1] using the values of the control parameters corresponding to the evolution of Figs. 3 and 4.\nL[\u03c1] is the Liouvillian superoperator that can be written\n\u221a\nas L[\u03c1] = L\u2020 \u03c1L + 21 {L\u2020 L, \u03c1} where L\u2020 = \u03b3 b\u2193 accounts\nfor the spontaneous radiative recombination of the exciton in the dot. Once \u03c1 is obtained, a 4\u00d74 reduced density\nmatrix for the impurity spins \u03c1S is computed by tracing\nout the exciton degrees of freedom. The entanglement in\nthe Bell state is mostly sensitive to decoherence processes\nand its analysis provides a good test for the scheme. We\nquantify the error on the reduced density matrix \u03c1S using\ntwo different methods, the Purity and the Peres criterion\nof separability.16 According to the Peres criterion a state\nis entangled iff Emin < 0, where Emin is the minimum\neigenvalue of a matrix constructed by transposing the\nnon-diagonal 2 \u00d7 2 blocks of \u03c1S . A maximally entangled\nstate has a Emin = \u22121/2. The deviation from that value\ngives a measure of the effect of the radiative recombination on the entanglement and we quantify the entanglement error as \u2206E = Emin + 1/2. The purity of \u03c1S is\na different parameter that characterizes the error in the\nspins states due to their entanglement with the exciton\nin the dot. We quantify this error as \u2206P = T r\u03c12S \u2212 1. In\nprinciple there are errors that can disentangle the spin\nstates without a change in the purity, for instance by\naffecting the phase picked up in Eq. (8). Therefore, in\nprinciple the errors induced by \u03b3 affect independently\n\u2206E and \u2206P .\nWe compare in Fig. 5 the errors in the Entanglement\n\u2206E (upper) and in the Purity \u2206P as a function of \u03b3 for\nboth the adiabatic and nonadiabatic evolution. Both errors increase linearly at small \u03b3. However, the errors in\nthe adiabatic case are always smaller than in the nonadiabatic case in the range of parameters we have investigated. We remark that, due to the incommensurability of the eigenvalues of HS and HT , there are not special conditions that would give perfect entanglement with\nsquare pulses as in the case of a direct spin-spin coupling.15 An important figure of merit for the application\nof this quantum control technique to quantum computation is provided by the error per gate parameter. This\nhas to be below a threshold value in order to make scalable quantum computing possible. The estimate for such\na threshold depends on assumptions on the error model\nand device capabilities but the 10\u22124 value 17 is usually\nused as a benchmark in typical experimental implementations. The error in the entanglement production gives\nan estimation of the error per gate\n\u221a since the quantum\noperation done corresponds to a SW AP modulo some\nsingle qubit operations. We see in Fig. 5 that the 10\u22124\nthreshold can be achieved for \u03b3 smaller than 1\u03bceV . Self\nassembled QDs have typically a ground state exciton lifetime of the order of one or more nanoseconds and would\n\n1\n\nC. Piermarocchi and G. F. Quinteiro, Phys. Rev.

In the case of \u03b3 = 0,\nthe parameters for the quantum control can be analytically determined from the roots of simple integral equations. We showed that the finite lifetime \u03b3 \u22121 of the exciton in the dot can affect the purity of the spin states and\nintroduces errors in the entanglement production. In addition we found that such errors increase linearly with \u03b3\nand can be kept below the 10\u22124 threshold for error correction if parameters typical of self assembled QDs are\nused in the simulation.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThis work was supported by the NSF Grant DMR0312491.
