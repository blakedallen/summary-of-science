These ideas were further supported by the observational\ndata from COBE (Cosmic Background Explorer) and WMAP (The Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe) where small anisotropy in the microwave\nbackground radiation was found. These lead many cosmologists to consider\nthe anisotropic model to describe the initial phase of the evolution which\neventually decays into an isotropic FRW one.\nAfter the famous paper by A. Guth [2], scalar field was hugely used in\nsimulating different cosmological models. But the question occurs, if other\nfields can contribute to the evolution of the Universe. As an alternative the\nspinor field was used due to its sensitivity to the gravitational one [3, 4,\n5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]. The nonlinear spinor field proved to be able to describe\ndifferent cosmological models. For example it was shown that a suitable\nchoice of nonlinearity (i) accelerates the isotropization process, (ii) gives rise\nto a singularity-free Universe and (iii) generates late time acceleration.\nMoreover, it is shown that a nonlinear spinor field can be used to simulate\na perfect fluid from ekpyrotic matter to phantom matter [11, 12, 13].\nAt the same time the string cosmological models have been used in attempts to describe the early Universe and to investigate anisotropic dark\nenergy component including a coupling between dark energy and a perfect\nfluid (dark matter) [14, 15]. Cosmic strings are one dimensional topological\ndefects associated with spontaneous symmetry breaking in gauge theories.\nTheir presence in the early Universe can be justified in the frame of grand\nunified theories (GUT).\nOn the other hand, the magnetic field has an important role at the cosmological scale and is present in galactic and intergalactic spaces. Any theoretical study of cosmological models which contain a magnetic field must take\ninto account that the corresponding Universes are necessarily anisotropic.\nAmong the anisotropic spacetimes, Bianchi type-I space (BI) seems to be\nthe most convenient for testing different cosmological models.\nThe object of this paper is to investigate a BI string cosmological model in\nthe presence of a magnetic flux. For this purpose we use the nonlinear spinor\nfield simulation as was described recently in a number of papers [11, 12, 13].\n\n2\n\n\f2\n\nBasic equations\n\nWe study the evolution of the Universe in presence of a cosmic string and a\nmagnetic flux in the framework of a BI anisotropic cosmological model. For\na BI spacetime the line element is given by\nds2 = (dt)2 \u2212 a21 (t)(dx1 )2 \u2212 a22 (t)(dx2 )2 \u2212 a23 (t)(dx3 )2 .\n\n(1)\n\nThere are three scale factors ai (i = 1, 2, 3) which are functions of time t only\nand consequently three expansion rates. In principle all these scale factors\ncould be different and it is useful to express the mean expansion rate in terms\nof the average Hubble rate:\n1 \u0010 \u02271 \u02272 \u02273 \u0011\nH=\n+\n+\n,\n(2)\n3 a1 a2 a3\nwhere over-dot means differentiation with respect to t.\nEinstein's gravitational field equations, corresponding to the metric (1)\nhave the form\n\u00e42 \u00e43 \u02272 \u02273\n+\n+\na2 a3 a2 a3\n\u00e43 \u00e41 \u02273 \u02271\n+\n+\na3 a1 a3 a1\n\u00e41 \u00e42 \u02271 \u02272\n+\n+\na1 a2 a1 a2\n\u02271 \u02272 \u02272 \u02273 \u02273 \u02271\n+\n+\na1 a2 a2 a3 a3 a1\n\n= \u03baT11 ,\n\n(3a)\n\n= \u03baT22 ,\n\n(3b)\n\n= \u03baT33 ,\n\n(3c)\n\n= \u03baT00 ,\n\n(3d)\n\nwhere \u03ba is the gravitational constant. The energy momentum tensor for a\nsystem of cosmic string and magnetic field in a comoving coordinate is given\nby\nT\u03bc\u03bd = \u03c1u\u03bc u\u03bd \u2212 \u03bbx\u03bc x\u03bd + E\u03bc\u03bd ,\n(4)\nwhere \u03c1 is the rest energy density of strings with massive particles attached\nto them and can be expressed as \u03c1 = \u03c1p + \u03bb, where \u03c1p is the rest energy\ndensity of the particles attached to the strings and \u03bb is the tension density of\nthe system of strings [16, 17, 18] which may be positive or negative. Here ui\nis the four velocity and xi is the direction of the string, obeying the relations\nui ui = \u2212xi xi = 1,\n3\n\nui xi = 0 .\n\n(5)\n\n\fIn (4) E\u03bc\u03bd is the electromagnetic field [19] and in what follows we shall\nchoose the string and also the magnetic field along x1 direction. In our model\nthe electromagnetic field tensor F \u03b1\u03b2 has only one non-vanishing component,\nnamely\nF23 = h ,\n(6)\nwhere h is presumed to be constant. For the electromagnetic field E\u03bc\u03bd one\ngets the following non-trivial components\nE00 = E11 = \u2212E22 = \u2212E33 =\n\nh2\n1 \u03b22\n.\n\u2261\n2\u03bc\u0304a22 a23\n2 (a2 a3 )2\n\n(7)\n\nwhere \u03bc\u0304 is a constant characteristic of the medium and called the magnetic\npermeability. Typically \u03bc\u0304 differs from unity only by a few parts in 10\u22125\n(\u03bc\u0304 > 1 for paramagnetic substances and \u03bc\u0304 < 1 for diamagnetic). To simplify\nthe notation, we include in a constant \u03b2 the value of the electromagnetic\nfield, h, and the magnetic permeability, \u03bc\u0304.\nUsing comoving coordinates we have the following components of energy\nmomentum tensor [20]:\n\u03b2 2 a21\n,\n2 \u03c42\nwhere we introduce the volume scale of the BI space-time [4]\n\u221a\n\u03c4 = \u2212g = a1 a2 a3 ,\nT00 \u2212 \u03c1 = T11 \u2212 \u03bb = \u2212T22 = \u2212T33 =\n\nwhich is connected with the Hubble rate (2), namely\nIn view of T22 = T33 from (8) one finds\n\u0013\n\u0012 Z\ndt\u2032\n,\na2 = a3 D exp X\n\u03c4\n\n\u03c4\u0307\n\u03c4\n\n(8)\n\n(9)\n\n= 3H .\n\n(10)\n\nwith D and X some integration constants.\nOn the other hand, summation of Einstein equations (3a), (3b), (3c) and\nthree times (3d) gives:\n\u03c4\u0308\n1 \u0010\na2 \u0011\n= \u03ba 3\u03c1 + \u03bb + \u03b2 2 12 .\n(11)\n\u03c4\n2\n\u03c4\nTaking into account the conservation of the energy-momentum tensor,\n\u03bd\ni.e., T\u03bc;\u03bd\n= 0, after a little manipulation of (8) one obtains [21, 22]:\n\u03c4\u0307\n\u02271\n\u03c1\u0307 + \u03c1 \u2212 \u03bb = 0 .\n\u03c4\na1\n4\n\n(12)\n\n\fIt is customary to assume a relation between \u03c1 and \u03bb in accordance with\nthe state equations for strings. The simplest one is a proportionality relation\n[16]:\n\u03c1 = \u03b1\u03bb .\n(13)\nAmong the most usual choices of the constant \u03b1 we mention the following:\n\uf8f1\ngeometric string\n\uf8f2 1,\n1 + \u03c9,\n\u03c9 \u2265 0, p string or Takabayasi string\n\u03b1=\n(14)\n\uf8f3\n\u22121,\nReddy string\nIt is possible to consider a more general barotropic relation\n\u03c1 = \u03c1(\u03bb) .\n\n(15)\n\nthan the linear relation (13), subject to the restrictions imposed by the energy\nconditions. The weak energy condition as well as the strong one require \u03c1 \u2265 \u03bb\nwith \u03bb \u2265 0 or \u03c1 \u2265 0 with \u03bb < 0 and the dominant energy condition implies\n\u03c1 \u2265 0 and \u03c12 \u2265 \u03bb2 [16].\n\n3\n\nSpinor field approach\n\nRecently it was shown that a nonlinear spinor can be used to simulate different types of perfect fluids including those called ekpyrotic, phantom matter\nand dark energy [11, 12, 13]. Here we show that it is possible to describe\ncosmic strings in terms of spinor fields as well.\n\n3.1\n\nSpinor field simulation\n\nWe shall simulate the cloud formed by massive cosmic strings with particles\nattached along their extensions with a nonlinear spinor field described by the\nLagrangian:\n\u0014\n\u0015\ni\n\u03bc\n\u03bc\nLsp = \u03c8\u0304\u03b3 \u2207\u03bc \u03c8 \u2212 \u2207\u03bc \u03c8\u0304\u03b3 \u03c8 \u2212 m\u03c8\u0304\u03c8 + F ,\n(16)\n2\nwith F being some arbitrary function of the scalar S = \u03c8\u0304\u03c8. For the simulation of the present cosmological model in which the anisotropic scale factors\nai are functions solely of time it is adequate to assume that the spinor field\n5\n\n\fdepends on t only. Then the corresponding components of energy-momentum\ntensor take the form\nT00 = mS \u2212 F ,\ndF\nTii = S\n\u2212 F , i = 1, 2, 3 .\ndS\n\n(17a)\n(17b)\n\nIn what follows we describe the energy density \u03c1 of the string by T00 and\nthe tension density \u03bb by T11 in agreement with (8). Inserting (17a) and (17b)\ninto (13) we find\ndF\n1\nm\nS\n\u2212 (1 \u2212 )F \u2212 S = 0 ,\n(18)\ndS\n\u03b1\n\u03b1\nwith the solution\nF = C1 S (\u03b1\u22121)/\u03b1 + mS .\n(19)\nHere C1 is an integration constant. The positivity of T00 imposes some restriction on C1 , namely C1 \u2264 0. Setting C1 = \u2212\u03bd we find the cosmic string\ncan be described by the spinor field Lagrangian\n\u0014\n\u0015\ni\n\u03bc\n\u03bc\nLsp = \u03c8\u0304\u03b3 \u2207\u03bc \u03c8 \u2212 \u2207\u03bc \u03c8\u0304\u03b3 \u03c8 \u2212 \u03bdS (\u03b1\u22121)/\u03b1 ,\n(20)\n2\nremarking the disappearance of the mass term [11].\nWith these preparatives we get\n\u03c1 = T00 = \u03bdS (\u03b1\u22121)/\u03b1 ,\n\u03bd (\u03b1\u22121)/\u03b1\n\u03bb = T11 =\nS\n.\n\u03b1\n\n(21a)\n(21b)\n\nVariation on (16) with respect to \u03c8 and \u03c8\u0304 gives spinor field equations with\nnonlinear terms. On the other hand from the spinor field equations for S one\nfinds [4]\n\u03c4\u0307\n\u1e60 + S = 0 ,\n(22)\n\u03c4\nwith the solution\nC0\n,\n(23)\nS=\n\u03c4\nC0 being a constant.\nTaking into account this simple behavior of S we have finally\n\u03b1\u22121\n\n\u03c1 = R\u03c4 \u2212 \u03b1 ,\nR \u2212 \u03b1\u22121\n\u03bb =\n\u03c4 \u03b1 ,\n\u03b1\n6\n\n(24a)\n(24b)\n\n\f\u03b1\u22121\n\nwith the constant R = \u03bdC0 \u03b1 .\nUsing the above formulas for \u03c1 and \u03bb, from (12) we can determine the\nanisotropic factor a1 :\na1 = A1 \u03c4 ,\n(25)\nA1 being a constant of integration. On the other hand, from equations (9)\nand (10) we obtain\nr\n\u0013\n\u0012 Z\nD\ndt\u2032\nX\na2 =\n,\n(26)\nexp\nA1\n2\n\u03c4\nand\n\n3.2\n\n\u0013\n\u0012\nZ\ndt\u2032\n1\nX\n.\na3 = \u221a\nexp \u2212\n2\n\u03c4\nA1 D\n\n(27)\n\nAsymptotic behavior\n\nIn what follows, we study the equation for \u03c4 in details. Using the above\nexpressions for \u03c1, \u03bb, a1 we get from (11):\n\u03c4\u0308 =\n\n1\n\u03ba 3\u03b1 + 1\n\u03ba\u03b2 2 A21\nR\u03c4 \u03b1 +\n\u03c4.\n2 \u03b1\n2\n\n(28)\n\nWe can evaluate the derivative of \u03c4 with respect to t which leads finally to a\nsolution in quadrature\nZ\nd\u03c4\np\n= t + t0 ,\n(29)\n[\u03baR(3\u03b1 + 1)/(\u03b1 + 1)]\u03c4 (\u03b1+1)/\u03b1 + [\u03ba\u03b2 2 A21 /2]\u03c4 2 + C\n\nC and t0 being some integration constants.\nIn spite of the fact that this equation cannot be explicitly solved, the\nasymptotic behavior of the solutions for t \u2192 \u221e could be found.\n3.2.1\n\nCase I\n\nIn most cases, (29) provides a standing expansion of the volume scale of the\nBI spacetime for t growing.\nIndeed, for\n\u03b1+1\n\u2264 2,\n(30)\n\u03b1\n\n7\n\n\fi.e. \u03b1 \u2265 1 or \u03b1 < 0, the term with \u03c4 2 at the denominator of the l. h. s. of\n(29) is dominant and we get an exponential behavior\n\u03c4 \u221d exp t ,\n\n(31)\n\nfor large t. In this case, only the anisotropic factor a1 presents an exponential\nincrease for t \u2192 \u221e, while the scale factors a2 and a3 tend to constants.\nConcerning the asymptotic behavior of \u03c1 and \u03bb we infer from (24a), (24b)\nthat they tend to zero as\n\u03c1,\u03bb \u221d\n3.2.2\n\n1\nexp\n\n\u0001.\n\n(32)\n\n\u03b1\u22121\nt\n\u03b1\n\nCase II\n\nFor 0 < \u03b1 < 1, there is no solution with a \u03c4 \u2192 \u221e behavior for t \u2192 \u221e. In\nthis case from (29) one finds:\n\u03c4\n\n\u03b1\u22121\n2\u03b1\n\n\u221d t.\n\nSince \u03b1 \u2212 1 < 0, \u03c4 cannot tend to infinity as t \u2192 \u221e. Therefore the model\ndoes not admit a consistent solution for 0 < \u03b1 < 1 in agreement with the\ndiscussion of the general barotropic equation (15) from Section 2.\nTaking into account the absence of consistent solutions for 0 < \u03b1 < 1\nas it was shown above, for the present spinor simulation, in what follows we\nshall refer only to the situations described in subsection 3.2.1 (Case I). It is\nworth also mentioning that the present model does not support in any case\na vanishing of \u03c4 for t \u2192 \u221e.\n\n3.3\n\nNumerical simulations\n\nIn this subsection we graphically illustrate the evolution of energy density \u03c1,\nvolume scale \u03c4 and metric functions a1 , a2 and a3 . In doing so we rewrite\nthe equation for \u03c4 (28) in terms of the Hubble parameter H and introduce a\nnew function T :\n\u03c4\u0307 = 3H\u03c4,\n\u1e22 = \u22123H 2 +\n\u1e6a =\n\n(33a)\n2\n\nA21\n\n\u03ba 3\u03b1 + 1 1\u2212\u03b1 \u03ba\u03b2\nR\u03c4 \u03b1 +\n6 \u03b1\n6\n\nT\n.\n\u03c4\n\n,\n\n(33b)\n(33c)\n\n8\n\n\fWe also rewrite the metric functions in terms of T , which now read\nr\nr\nD X/2\n1\na1 = A1 \u03c4, a2 =\nT , a3 =\nT \u2212X/2 .\nA1\nA1 D\n\n(34)\n\nLet us now numerically solve the system (33). In doing so for simplicity\nwe set \u03ba = 1, A1 = 1, D = 1 and X = 1. In Fig. 1 we plot the evolution of\nenergy density \u03c1 for different values of \u03b1, namely for \u03b1 = \u22121 and \u03b1 = 1.5.\nEvolution of \u03c4 corresponding to these values of parameters in shown in Fig.\n2. For simplicity we also set the initial values of \u03c4 , H and T to be unity.\n\nFigure 1: View of energy density\nof the cosmic string for different\nvalue of \u03b1.\n\nFigure 2: Evolution of the Universe corresponding to the energy\ndensities given in Fig. 1.\n\nThe numerical simulations support the behavior described in (31), (32).\nFrom Fig. 2 one finds at first, in the case of a negative \u03b1 the Universe\nexpands slower than it does as for a positive \u03b1, though in both cases we have\nan exponential growth for large time.\nIn Figs. 3 and 4 we plot the behavior of metric functions for positive\nand negative values of \u03b1. As is seen from the figures, with the expansion of\nthe Universe a1 increases exponentially, while a2 , a3 tend to constants. Thus\nwe see that introduction of cosmic string does not allow isotropization of\ninitially anisotropic space-time. In the following subsections we discuss the\nsingularity problem and isotropization process in detail.\n9\n\n\fFigure 3: Evolution of metric functions for \u03b1 = 1.5.\n\n3.4\n\nFigure 4: Evolution of metric functions for \u03b1 = \u22121.\n\nSingularities\n\nThe next task is to investigate the space-time singularities in the present\nmodel. Let us rewrite the metric functions in the following form:\n\u0013\n\u0012 Z\ndt\u2032\nNi\n,\n(35)\nai = Ci \u03c4 exp Yi\n\u03c4\np\n\u221a\nwhere C1 = A1 , C2 = D/A1 , C3 = 1/ DA1 , N1 = +1, N2 = N3 = 0, Y1 =\n0, Y2 = X/2, and Y3 = \u2212X/2. Then the first and the second derivatives of\nthe metric functions take the form:\n\u03c4\u0307\nYi\n\u0227i\n= Ni + ,\nai\n\u03c4\n\u03c4\n\u0010 \u03c4\u0307 \u00112\n\u00e4i\n\u03c4\u0308\nYi2\n\u03c4\u0307\n2\n= Ni + (Ni \u2212 Ni )\n+ (2Ni \u2212 1)Yi 2 + 2 .\nai\n\u03c4\n\u03c4\n\u03c4\n\u03c4\n\n(36a)\n(36b)\n\nWe study the singularities analyzing the regularity properties of the Kretschmann scalar which for the metric (1) reads\nK=4\n\nh\u0010 \u00e4 \u00112\n1\n\na1\n\n+\n\n\u0010 \u00e4 \u00112\n2\n\na2\n\n+\n\n\u0010 \u00e4 \u00112\n3\n\na3\n\n+\n\n\u0010 \u0227 \u0227 \u00112 \u0010 \u0227 \u0227 \u00112 \u0010 \u0227 \u0227 \u00112 i\n1 2\n2 3\n3 1\n. (37)\n+\n+\na1 a2\na2 a3\na3 a1\n10\n\n\fEvidently, a singularity can occur when some or all scale factors ai tend to\nzero or infinity. We shall follow the criteria given in [23] which states:\n(i) t finite, some ai \u2192 \u221e. If at least one scale factor becomes infinite at\nfinite t, it is a curvature singularity.\n(ii) t finite, some ai \u2192 0. If more than one scale factor turns to zero at\nfinite t, it is a singularity. If only one scale factor is zero at finite t, the\nspacetime can be nonsingular.\n(iii) t \u2192 \u221e, some ai \u2192 \u221e. Such an asymptotic can only be singular if at\nleast one scale factor grows faster than exponentially:\nai (t) \u226b exp (k|t|), k = const. > 0.\n(iv)t \u2192 \u221e, some ai \u2192 0. Such an asymptotic can only be singular if at\nleast one scale factor vanishes faster than exponentially:\nai (t) \u226a O(exp [\u2212k|t|]), k = const. > 0.\nLooking at the asymptotic behaviors described above (Section 3.2) we\nconclude that in the spinor field approach of the cosmic strings the present\nmodel is nonsingular at the end of the evolution. No scale factor of the BI\nmetric presents a growth faster than exponentially or vanishing faster than\nexponentially for t \u2192 \u221e.\n\n3.5\n\nIsotropization\n\nSince the present-day Universe is surprisingly isotropic, it is important to\nsee whether our anisotropic BI model evolves into an isotropic FRW model.\nIsotropization means that at large physical times t, when the volume factor\n\u03c4 tends to infinity, the three scale factors ai (t) grow at the same rate. Two\nwide-spread criteria of isotropization read\n3\n\nA =\n\u03a32 =\n\n1 X Hi2\n\u2212 1 \u2192 0,\n3 i=1 H 2\n\n(38a)\n\n1\nAH 2 \u2192 0 .\n2\n\n(38b)\n\nHere A and \u03a32 are the average anisotropy and shear, respectively, while\nHi = \u0227i /ai is the directional Hubble parameter evaluated in (36a). We also\ninvestigate the isotropization condition proposed in [23]\nai\na\n\nt\u2192\u221e\n\n\u2192 const ,\n11\n\n(39)\n\n\fwhere a(t) = \u03c4 1/3 is the average scale factor. Provided that condition (39)\nis fulfilled, by rescaling some of the coordinates, we can make ai /a \u2192 1, and\nthe metric will become manifestly isotropic at large t.\nIn order to study the isotropization process in the present model, we\nevaluate from (35)\n\u0013\n\u0012 Z\nai\nai\ndt\u2032\nNi \u22121/3\n,\n(40)\n= 1/3 = Ci \u03c4\nexp Yi\na\n\u03c4\n\u03c4\nTaking into account the value of Ni and Yi we see that ai /a do not tend to\nconstants as t \u2192 \u221e. For example, in the generic case with the exponential\nexpansion of the volume of the Universe (31), a1 /a \u2192 \u221e, a2 /a \u2192 0 and\na3 /a \u2192 0. So in the case considered, no isotropization process takes place.\nIndeed, at the early stage of evolution, where \u03c4 \u2192 0 we assume a1 \u2192 \u221e,\na2 \u2192 0 and a3 \u2192 0, that is at this stage the Universe looks like a onedimensional string. In the asymptotic region where t \u2192 \u221e and \u03c4 \u2192 \u221e we\nhave a1 \u2192 \u221e, while a2 and a3 evaluating to finite values.\nLet us also examine the possibility of an isotropization process using\nconditions (38). In view of (36) from (38) in the generic case (31) one finds:\nA = 2,\n1\n\u03a32 =\n.\n9\n\n(41a)\n(41b)\n\nAs one sees, both A and \u03a32 are some positive defined, non vanishing quantities. Thus, in general, the present model does not undergo an isotropization\nprocess, the anisotropic feature of the Universe from the early stages being\nretained.\n\n4\n\nConclusions\n\nWe have studied the evolution of a anisotropic universe given by a BI cosmological model in presence of cosmic strings and magnetic field. In doing\nso we exploit the spinor simulation of cosmic strings that allows us to solve\nthe system of Einstein's equations. Exact solutions have been supplemented\nwith some numerical evaluations. It is shown that the presence of cosmic\nstrings does not allow the anisotropic Universe to evolve into an isotropic\none.\n12\n\n\fAcknowledgments\nThe authors gratefully acknowledge the support from the joint RomanianLIT, JINR, Dubna Research Project, theme no. 05-6-1060-2005/2010.
