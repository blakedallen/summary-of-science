This is consistent with a picture in which the absorbing gas has low density and\nlow metallicity and is distributed in a smooth absorbing shell located beyond the emissionline gas. However, the main absorbers in 0200+015 are very different. The previous single\nabsorber fit of HI column density \u2243 1019 cm\u22122 , now splits into two \u223c 4 \u00d7 1014 cm\u22122 absorbers which extend more than 15 kpc to obscure additional Ly\u03b1 emission coincident with a\nradio lobe in these high-resolution observations.

The metallicity, inferred from the C IV absorption, is considerably lower in 0943242 than in 0200+015. We explain these differences with an evolutionary scenario based on\nthe size of the radio source. In both sources the HI absorption gas originates from either a\ngas-rich merger or pristine cluster gas which cools and collapses towards the centre of the\ndark matter halo. The higher metallicity in the larger radio source (0200+015) may be a result\nof a starburst driven superwind (concurrent with the triggering of the radio emission) which\nhas engulfed the outer halo in this older source.\nWe also find a significant blue asymmetry in the HeII\u03bb1640 emission line, suggesting\nthat the line emitting gas is outflowing from the central regions. Dust obscuration toward the\ncentral engine, presumably due to the dusty torus invoked in Unified Scheme, prevents us\nfrom seeing outflow away from our line-of-sight.\nKey words: galaxies: active - galaxies: halos - galaxies: high-redshift - galaxies: emission\nlines - galaxies - absorption lines\n\n1 INTRODUCTION\nThe existence of powerful radio galaxies at high redshift (z > 2)\ndemonstrates that a population of supermassive black holes (>\n109 M\u2299 ; Dunlop et al. 2002) was in place just a few billion years\nafter the Big Bang. Like their counterparts at low redshift, the highredshift radio galaxies (HzRGs) appear to reside in the most massive elliptical galaxies at their epoch (e.g. Jarvis et al. 2001b),\nin line with the established correlation between black hole and\nspheroid mass (Magorrian et al. 1998). Whilst the discovery of radio quiet galaxies at high redshift via Lyman drop-out techniques\n\n\u22c6\n\nBased on observations performed at the European Southern Observatory,\nChile (Programme ID: 68.B-0086(A))\n\u2020 Email: jarvis@strw.leidenuniv.nl\n\nmeans that they are no longer our only probe of high redshift galaxy\nformation, the HzRGs still provide the most important insights into\nthe early formation of the most massive bound structures. Indeed,\nthe depth of the gravitational potential wells in which they form\nrenders them prime targets for searching for high-redshift protoclusters, as confirmed by the recent discoveries of over-densities\nof Ly\u03b1 emitters around such objects (see e.g. Kurk et al. 2000;\nPentericci et al. 2000; Venemans et al. 2002).\nOne of the most prominent characteristics of HzRGs are\ntheir extended emission line regions (EELRs), which are luminous\n(> 1037 W in Ly\u03b1), tens to several hundred kpc in size (often\naligned with the radio axis) and kinematically active (FWHM &\n1000 km s\u22121 ). Their dominant ionisation mechanism seems to\nchange from shocks to photoionisation by the central engine as\nthe radio source expands beyond the confines of the host galaxy\n\n\f2\n\nJarvis et al.\n\n(Best et al. 2000; De Breuck et al. 2000; Jarvis et al. 2001a). Likewise the kinematics of the gas may reflect the competing influences\nof gravity, and energy input via shocks from the radio source and\nstarburst-driven superwinds. However, there are many unresolved\nissues which remain concerning the structure, origin and fate of the\nemission line gas, which may hold important clues to many aspects\nof massive galaxy formation. Did the gas originate in a cooling flow\nor a merger, or was it expelled from the central galaxy during a violent starburst? Is it in the form of cloudlets, filaments or expanding\nshells of material, and what is their composition? What is the ultimate fate of the gas, will it form stars or escape from the galaxy to\nenrich the surrounding intracluster and intergalactic media?\nA new perspective on many of these issues was opened up with\nthe discovery by R\u00f6ttgering et al. (1995) and van Ojik et al. (1997;\nhereafter vO97) that most of the smaller high redshift radio sources\n(those with projected linear size D < 50 kpc) exhibit spatially resolved HI absorption in their Ly\u03b1 emission-line profiles, with column densities in the range 1018 \u20131019.5 cm\u22122 . Binette et al. (2000;\nhereafter B00) found, for the z = 2.92 radio galaxy 0943\u2212242,\nC IV\u03bb\u03bb1548,1551 absorption lines superimposed on the C IV emission, at the same redshift as the main Ly\u03b1 absorption system.\nThey could not reconcile the observed C IV/Ly\u03b1 emission- and\nabsorption-line ratios with a model in which the absorption- and\nemission-line gas are co-spatial. Instead they proposed that the absorbing gas is of lower metallicity (Z \u223c 0.01Z\u2299 ) and located\nfurther away from the host galaxy than the emission line gas, beyond the high pressure radio source cocoon. This material, they\nclaimed, is thus a relic reservoir of low metallicity, low density\n(\u223c 10\u22122.5 cm\u22123 ) gas, similar to that from which the parent galaxy\nmay have formed. This shell-like distribution of the absorbing gas\nwas also invoked by Jarvis et al. (2001a) and De Breuck et al.\n(2000) to explain various correlations found in a complete sample\nof high-redshift (z > 2) radio galaxies.\n\n2 OBSERVATIONS AND DATA REDUCTION\nThe observations were performed with the UVES echelle spectrograph on VLT UT2 at the European Southern Observatory on\nthe night of 2001 December 8-9. For 0200+015, dichroic 1 was\nused with cross-disperser 1 in the blue arm (central wavelength\nof 3950\u00c5, for Ly\u03b1), and cross-disperser 3 in the red arm (central\nwavelength of 5800\u00c5, for C IV\u03bb\u03bb1548,1551 and HeII\u03bb1640); three\nseparate exposures of 1 hour were taken. For the 0943-242, just the\nred arm was used, with cross-disperser 3 set to a central wavelength\nof 5200\u00c5, sufficient to cover both Ly\u03b1 and C IV\u03bb\u03bb1548,1551. Separate exposures totalling 3.4 hours were acquired. For all observations on-chip binning of 2 \u00d7 3 (spatial \u00d7 spectral) was used, resulting in a pixel size of 0.5 arcsec in the red arm, and 0.36 arcsec in the blue. The resulting pixel scales in the dispersion direction for the various set-ups were in the range 0.05-0.06\u00c5. Together\nwith a slit-width of 1.2 arcsec, the resulting spectral resolutions\nwere 25000-40000. The seeing was steady throughout the night at\n\u223c 0.8 arcsec, and the sky dark and photometric. The slit position\nangles were chosen to align with the radio axes and previous observations, namely 155 degrees for 0200+015 and 74 degrees east of\nnorth for 0200+015 and 0943-242 respectively.\nOffline reduction was performed with IRAF, following the\nprocedures for echelle data described by Churchill (1995). For each\ntarget, the individual exposures were median combined to remove\ncosmic rays, bias-subtracted and flat-fielded. The order-definition\nframes were used to determine the locations of the orders, which\nwere then extracted and wavelength calibrated using a ThAr arc\nand combined. The blaze function of the grating was removed using\nobservations of the G-type spectrophotometric standard LTT 1020.\nSpectra for individual spatial regions along the slit were extracted,\nrebinned by a factor of 2 in dispersion to improve the signal-tonoise ratio.\n\n3 ANALYSIS\nIn this paper we probe the HI and C IV absorbers in greater\ndetail using the UVES spectrograph on the VLT to obtain echelle\nspectra of two high-redshift radio galaxies, the aforementioned\n0943-242 and 0200+015 at z=2.23. The new observations offer a\nfactor of 10 improvement in spectral resolution over previous investigations and thus have the potential (i) to reveal whether the\nmain absorbers are genuinely in the form of a single component\nwith ordered global kinematics, or whether they fragment into a\nnumber of weaker absorbers; (ii) to probe the emission-line kinematics with high velocity resolution.\nIn section 2 we describe the observations and data reduction\nof our VLT-UVES spectroscopic observations and in section 3 we\nbriefly discuss the emission- and absorption-line fitting procedure.\nIn section 4 we use our new high-resolution spectra to investigate\nthe absorption halo of the z = 2.92 radio galaxy 0943-242. Section 5 is a detailed discussion of the absorbing halo around the\nz = 2.23 radio galaxy 0200+015 and we also investigate the kinematics of the narrow-emission lines via the unabsorbed HeII emission line and briefly discuss the effect of emission-line asymmetry\non our absorption line fitting. The origin and fate of the absorbing\nhalos is discussed in section 6 and we provide a summary of our\nconclusions in section 7.\nAll physical distances are calculated assuming H0\n70 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 , \u03a9M = 0.3 and \u03a9\u039b = 0.7.\n\n=\n\nThe extracted 1-d spectra were fitted with a series of Voigt absorption line profiles superimposed upon a Gaussian emission envelope.\nWe choose an underlying Gaussian emission-line profile as studies\nof narrow-line profiles in Seyfert-2 galaxies show that this is preferred over a Lorentzian profile in the majority of cases (e.g. V\u00e9ronCetty, V\u00e9ron & Gon\u00e7alves 2001), but see section 5.2 for further discussion of this point. The model profiles were convolved with the\ninstrumental function prior to fitting (as described by R\u00f6ttgering et\nal. 1995 and B00). There is no detected continuum underlying the\nemission lines.\n\n4 0943-242: CONCLUSIVE EVIDENCE FOR A DISTINCT\nSHELL OF ABSORPTION-LINE GAS?\nFig. 1 shows the 1-d spectrum of the Ly\u03b1 and C IV emission\nlines in 0943-242, extracted over the central 5 arcsec of the slit\nwhich covers all of the emission. The fit, with a series of Voigt profile absorbers superimposed upon a Gaussian emission envelope is\nshown, and the parameters tabulated in Table 1. The errors were\ncalculated by assuming a \u03c72 distribution of \u2206\u03c72 (\u2261 \u03c72 \u2212 \u03c72min )\n(Lampton, Margon & Bowyer 1976). The error on each parameter\nwas calculated by setting \u2206\u03c72 = 1 and allowing the other parameters to float. The errors quoted are 1\u03c3.\nThe most notable feature of this spectrum is that the main absorber remains as a single system of column density \u223c 1019 cm\u22122 ,\n\n\fVLT-UVES observations of two HzRGs\nAbsorber\n\nz\n\nb\n( km s\u22121 )\n\nlog N (HI)\n( cm\u22122 )\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n\n2.9066 \u00b1 0.0062\n2.9185 \u00b1 0.0001\n2.9261 \u00b1 0.0005\n2.9324 \u00b1 0.0001\n\n88 \u00b1 45\n58 \u00b1 3\n109 \u00b1 35\n23 \u00b1 17\n\n14.02 \u00b1 0.30\n19.08 \u00b1 0.06\n13.55 \u00b1 0.16\n13.35 \u00b1 0.30\n\n3\n\nlog N (CIV)\n( cm\u22122 )\n2\n\n2.9192 \u00b1 0.0001\n\n119 \u00b1 2\n\n14.58 \u00b1 \u00b1 0.04\n\nTable 1. Parameters of the Voigt absorption profile fits for the main component of 0943-242. The final row corresponds to the fit of one absorber to\nthe CIV profile.\n\nand is completely black at its base with no evidence for substructure. No new absorption systems are identified in addition to those\nfound by R\u00f6ttgering et al. (1995) at a factor of \u223c 10 lower resolution.\nThis provides strong evidence that these absorption systems\nare physically distinct from the extended narrow-emission-line region. If the absorption was caused by gas which is mixed with the\nemission-line clouds, as postulated by vO97 then we would expect\na series of narrow-absorption troughs at various wavelengths across\nthe Ly\u03b1 emission profile. The fact that we see one main absorber,\nwith no detectable substructure, shifted blueward of the emissionline peak provides compelling evidence that the absorption gas encompasses the whole of the emission-line regions with a covering\nfactor of unity along our line-of-sight. This is in line with the argument proposed by B00 who fitted the emission- and absorption-line\nprofile of the C IV\u03bb\u03bb1548,1551 doublet in 0943-242 to determine\nthe metallicity of the absorption systems compared to the emissionline gas. Their results show that the emission and absorption line\nratios of C IV and Ly\u03b1 are incompatible with photoionisation or\ncollisional ionisation of cloudlets with uniform properties and the\npossibility that the absorption and emission phases are co-spatial is\nrejected. A different model was preferred in which the absorption\ngas has low metallicity and is located further away from the host\ngalaxy than the emission line gas.\n\nFigure 1.

This object was\ntaken from the original sample of vO97 and was chosen on account of its interesting absorption-line profile in the \u223c 2\u00c5 resolution spectrum of vO97. A further advantage of using this object\nfor our study is that its redshift permits further observations of all\nof the principal optical emission lines in the near-infrared transmission windows arising from AGN phenomena which will enable us\nto determine line ratios and investigate the ionisation mechanisms\nat work as a function of radial distance from the central source.\nExamination of the Ly\u03b1 region of the CCD frame of this object shows that the emission deviates from the centre of the order\n(as defined by the order definition frame) as a function of wavelength. This reflects spatial extent in the emitting and absorbing\ngas. Spectra were extracted for 2 spatial regions: the main body of\nthe galaxy between \u00b11.25 arcsec of the centroid, and a secondary\ncomponent lying between 1.25\u20132.5 arcsec to the north-west (1 arcsec translates into 8 kpc at this redshift), coincident with one of\n\nthe two radio lobes (see the radio continuum image in Carilli et\nal. 1997). Spectra with overlaid absorption models for these two\ncomponents are shown in Fig. 2, and the parameters tabulated in\nTables 2 and 5.\n5.1 The Ly\u03b1 emission from the nucleus\nThe core Ly\u03b1 emission-line profile (i.e. the emission associated with the centre of the radio galaxy host) has a redshift of z = 2.2292 and full width half maximum FWHM =\n1490 km s\u22121 . The emission line exhibits a number of absorbers\nwithin 320 km s\u22121 of the redshift of the peak of the Ly\u03b1 emission,\nconsistent with the lower resolution spectrum of vO97. However,\n\n\f4\n\nJarvis et al.\n\nFigure 3. The HeII profile of the central 2.5 arcsec of 0200+015.\n\nTable 3. Asymmetry of the HeII line in 0200+015\n\nFigure 2.

(b) (bottom) As in (a) but for the secondary (offset)\ncomponent of 0200+015, with the absorption model overlaid.\n\nat this higher resolution we do find that the main absorber, with a\nmeasured column density of NHI = 1019.1 cm\u22122 from vO97, is actually comprised of two absorption troughs with column densities\nof NHI = 1014.73 cm\u22122 and NHI = 1014.58 cm\u22122 with velocity\nwidths of 116 km s\u22121 and 61 km s\u22121 and redshifts of z = 2.2282\nand z = 2.2307 respectively.\nThere is also a NHI = 1015 cm\u22122 absorber blueward of these\nlines if our Gaussian emission profile is accurate. This absorption\ntrough has a much higher Doppler parameter of b = 612 km s\u22121 ,\nalthough the sensitivity of this absorption profile on the fit to the\nemission line is significant and we explore this further in section 5.2.\n5.2 Emission-line asymmetry and the evidence for outflow\nOne of the very noticeable aspects of the spectroscopic data on\nthese two high-redshift radio galaxies is that in the HeII emission\nline, in which associated absorption does not affect the profile of\nthe emission line, the blue side of the emission line has a longer\ntale than the redward side (Fig. 3). Using the profile analysis originally defined by Heckman et al. (1981) we assign a relative asymmetry, AI, to the emission at varying fractions of the total intensity where AI = 2[\u039bc \u2212 \u03bbc (i)]/\u03c9(i). Here \u03bbc (i) and \u03c9(i) are the\n\nper cent of peak (i)\n\n\u03bbc / \u00c5\n\n\u03c9 / \u00c5\n\nAI\n\n10\n20\n33\n50\n\n5296.4\n5296.9\n5298.1\n5298.9\n\n43.6\n36.1\n29.9\n23.0\n\n29.4\n32.4\n31.8\n33.9\n\nline centre and width at relative intensity i, respectively, and \u039bc is\nthe wavelength of the peak of the profile. The results of the profile\nanalysis are presented in Table 4. Using the FWHM of the asymmetric profile to determine the velocity dispersion of this line we\nfind v \u2248 1920 km s\u22121 .\nThis blue-tail line asymmetry has been found previously for\nthe narrow-line regions in many Seyfert galaxies (e.g. De Robertis\n& Shaw 1990) and is probably associated with an inflow or outflow\nof the gas into or from the central regions. Evidence from narrowline Seyfert galaxies points towards the view that the asymmetry is\ncaused by outflowing gas propagating towards us along our lineof-sight. The counter flow, which would produce a red-tail asymmetry, is obscured by dust residing within the radius of the narrowemission-line region. This is in line with the dusty torus invoked\nin orientation based Unified Schemes. The alternative view, that of\ninflowing gas, requires the dust to be mixed with the emission-line\nclouds. This would mean that the blue tail emanates from the far\nside of the galaxy. In this case the illuminated clouds on the near\nside along our line of sight suffer higher extinction than the illuminated clouds on the far side (e.g. De Robertis & Shaw 1990).\nHowever, ISO observations of NGC 4151 show that this explanation is not sufficient to explain the emission-line characteristic in\nthe infrared where the emission lines are much less susceptible to\nobscuration. Sturm et al. (1999) propose a central, optically thick\nobscuring screen close to the nucleus with outflowing emissionline regions, most plausibly associated with a nuclear outflow or a\nstarburst.\nObviously, this particular characteristic of the emission line\nregion needs exploring further with high-resolution spectroscopy\nof emission lines with a range in ionisation parameters to determine\nwhether the velocity of the material is dependent on the density of\nthe gas and its distance from the central ionizing source. However,\n\n\fVLT-UVES observations of two HzRGs\n\n5\n\nTable 4.

The Ly\u03b1 profile of the central 2.5 arcsec of 0200+015\n\nfitted with an asymmetric Gaussian with the same asymmetry as\nthe HeII emission line .\nfor the purposes of this paper where we are predominantly concerned with the absorbing shells, it highlights the fact that assuming\na simple Gaussian profile for the narrow emission lines may be too\nsimple. We have therefore refitted the Ly\u03b1 and C IV emission lines\nfor our two objects to determine whether this amount of asymmetry may significantly affect our fitted parameters to the absorption\ntroughs in any way.\nWe refitted our emission-line profiles with two single tailed\nGaussians with common peak intensities and a fixed ratio of\nFWHM derived from the asymmetry in the HeII line as a simple\napproximation to the asymmetry profile. Although we note that the\ndifferent ionisation potential for Ly\u03b1 and C IV compared to HeII\nmay affect the asymmetric profile, we do not expect this to be a significant difference given the uncertainties in our model fitting. With\nthis fixed asymmetry the resulting fits to the absorption troughs in\nboth Ly\u03b1 and C IV are not significantly altered, these fitted parameters are listed in Table 3\nWe therefore conclude that although there is evidence for line\nasymmetry in the narrow-emission-lines in HzRGs this does not alter the fits to the absorption troughs significantly and the original\nresults are still valid. This is quite surprising given the uncertainties arising from the emission-line profile. However, we note that\nit is very difficult to change the actual absorption columns given\nany reasonable Ly\u03b1 emission-line profile. This is particularly true\nwhere the emission is at a low level, i.e. around absorber #1 in\nFig. 2 and Fig. 4. Whereas the largest errors occur near the peak of\nthe emission where the absorbing columns (absorbers #2 and #3)\nhave larger associated errors. Furthermore, the fits to absorbers #2\nand #3 are more tightly constrained in b because the higher degree\nof absorption at lower b means that there is little room to manouvre in the absorption line fitting. The combination of these effects\nresults in little variation in the absorptions line column densities.\nHowever, we note that more extreme Ly\u03b1 emission-line profiles\nwill result in larger errors on the absorption-line fits in the wings of\nthe emission line.\n\n5.3 The Ly\u03b1 emission associated with the radio lobe\nWe also observe relatively bright Ly\u03b1 emission at the position of\none of the radio lobes associated with 0200+015. This emission lies\n\n\u2248 2.5 arcsec (\u2248 20 kpc) away from the nuclear emission. The bestfit Gaussian profile to this emission line shows that the emission has\na slightly higher redshift than that found towards the central radio\nnucleus (\u03b4v \u223c 150 km s\u22121 ) and has a FWHM = 1580 km s\u22121 .\nThis emission is presumably due to the passage of the radio\nemitting plasma disrupting the gas at these radii. Invoking the scenario set out by Jarvis et al. (2001a) based on the model of Bremer,\nFabian & Crawford (1997), in which the very extended narrowemission-line regions are compressed and shredded by the radio\njets, then this line emission may have been associated with the innermost low-density absorbing shell, which has condensed enough\nto be seen in emission. This would also explain the slight velocity shift of this emission line if the radio jet, which has essentially\nboosted this emission, is propagating away from our line-of-sight.\nHowever, regardless of the process by which the Ly\u03b1 photons are\nemitted, the surrounding absorbers are distributed in the same way\nas we see in the nuclear Ly\u03b1 emission. This is probably the most\ncompelling evidence that the absorbing gas is distributed in a shell\nencompassing the whole of the radio galaxy with a covering factor\nof \u2248 1, in line with our conclusions for 0943-242. The velocity\ndifference of the absorption systems detected in the Ly\u03b1 emission\nassociated with the nuclear emission and that at the position of the\nlobe is \u223c 30 km s\u22121 , thus we can be quite confident that the absorption systems seen in the lobe emission are associated with the\nabsorption systems associated with the nuclear emission.\nWe also find more absorbers in this extended emission line in\naddition to the four main absorbers found in the nuclear Ly\u03b1 emission line. These additional absorbers are on the red side of the Ly\u03b1\nemission line and have significantly lower column densities. The\nlargest velocity offset from the Ly\u03b1 emission-line redshift for these\nredshifted absorption systems is \u223c 600 km s\u22121 . The lower measured column densities of the absorption gas, implies that the covering factor is lower along the line-of-sight to the emission associated\nwith the lobe.\nIf we assume that the emission from the lobe, which is redshifted with respect to the Ly\u03b1 emission-line redshift at the nucleus,\nis on the far side and is propagating away from us, then any emission from this position would have to pass through both a lower\ncolumn density redshifted HI component associated with the far\nside and the bulk of the gas on the near side which is blueshifted.\nThis would explain the higher column density absorbing gas on the\nblue wing of the emission line.\n\n\f6\n\nJarvis et al.\n\nTable 5.

Ly\u03b1 absorber #4 would appear\nat \u2243 5007\u00c5,5017\u00c5 respectively, thus the 1548\u00c5 trough would\noverlap on the 1551\u00c5 trough of absorber #2. However, the lack of\nany apparent absorption at \u223c 5017\u00c5 suggests that the C IV absorption column is significantly lower (and is consistent with no\nC IV absorption at all) in this shell as compared to that associated\nwith absorber #2, and we assume that all of the C IV absorption can\nbe accounted for by associating it with Ly\u03b1 absorber #2. This implies a metallicity gradient in the environment of this radio source.\nOverzier et al. (2001) recently found strong evidence for a metallicity gradient within the gaseous halo of the z = 2.49 radio galaxy\nMRC2104-242. Overzier et al. (2001) attributed this metallicity\ngradient to a scenario in which the gas is associated with a massive cooling flow or originates from a merging event. This scenario\ncan also be extended to the absorption gas, and we return to this\npoint in section 6. However, one should keep in mind that the measured NCIV is an upper limit, due to possible extra absorption from\nthe other absorption shells.\n\n5.5 The metallicity of the absorbing shell\nIn this section we investigate whether the absorption- and emissionline gas can exist co-spatially or whether they are distributed differently based on ionisation models of gaseous slabs with the column\ndensities we observe. We use the method of B00 to investigate the\nmetallicity of the absorbing shell #2 which is the only one clearly\nseen in absorption in C IV. We use the observable quantity \u0393 as described by B00 to describe the various ratios between the emissionand the absorption-line properties of both Ly\u03b1 and C IV. \u0393 is defined as\nFigure 5. The CIV profile of 0200+015, with the vertical ticks indi-\n\ncating the location of the absorption doublet.\n5.4 The CIV emission from the nucleus\nIn the red arm of the spectrum, emission lines of the\nC IV\u03bb\u03bb1548\u00c5,1551\u00c5 doublet and HeII\u03bb1640\u00c5 are present. The\nformer is shown in Fig. 5, extracted across the entire galaxy because no spatial structure was evident1 and rebinned in wavelength\nby a factor of 10 to improve the signal to noise ratio. From our line\nfitting we find that the centre of the emission line is redshifted with\nrespect to the nuclear Ly\u03b1 emission line by \u223c 140 km s\u22121 , however this may be an artifact of trying to fit a symmetric line profile\n(cf. section 5.2) with a FWHM = 1940 km s\u22121 .\nA clear absorption doublet can be identified, corresponding to\nC IV\u03bb\u03bb1548\u00c5,1551\u00c5 at z \u2243 2.2285, i.e. roughly corresponding\nto absorption system #2 in Ly\u03b1 (see Tables 2 and 5).

Adopting the column of\nLy\u03b1 absorber #2 in Table 2 and that of CIV in Table 6, we obtain\nNHI /NCIV = 1.09\u00b10.04, hence \u0393 \u2248 0.13\u00b10.12. This is a factor\nof \u223c 5 \u00d7 104 smaller than the value found by B00 for 0943\u2013242 of\n\u0393 = 5400. B00 used the high \u0393 value in 0943\u2013242 as evidence that\nthe absorbing gas was physically distinct from the emission line regions and was of much lower density and metallicity. Calculations\nwith the MAPPINGS Ic code (Ferruit et al. 1997) indicate that our\nextremely small value of \u0393 effectively rules out that the same solar metallicities characterize both the emission- and the absorptionline regions. In fact, reproducing a \u0393 of 0.13 requires a metallicity\nof \u223c 10 Z\u2299 if we insist that the absorption and emission gas components have the same metallicities. Therefore, it is theoretically\npossible to reproduce \u0393 with a strong overabundance of metals,\nwhich may suggest that the emission gas and absorption gas might\nbe more directly inter-related in 0200+015 than in 0943\u2013242. On\nthe other hand, the fact that the emission has such a large FWHM\n2\n\nThe error quoted is the 1\u03c3 uncertainty derived from the symmetric and\nasymmetric Gaussian fits to the emission-lines of both Ly\u03b1 and C IV.\n\n\fVLT-UVES observations of two HzRGs\n\n7\n\nas compared to the b values of the absorption profiles and the near\nunity covering factor of the absorption gas, would still favour the\nsimple picture in which the absorption gas is more quiescent, possibly situated in quasi-uniform shells which are either expanding or\ninfalling.\n\n5.5.2 An absorbing shell surrounding the emission-line region\nWe now consider the absorption gas in isolation and attempt to explain the process by which the C IV column can be approximately\nequal to that of H I in the case of absorber #2. At a given metallicity, there exists a physical upper limit to the NCIV /NHI column\nratio which photoionisation models cannot exceed. This is shown\nin Fig. 6 which show photoionisation calculations by an ionizing\ncontinuum of photon index \u03b1 = \u22121 (F\u03bd \u221d \u03bd \u03b1 ) as a function of\nthe ionisation parameter3 U . The geometry considered was that of\nan optically thin slab with all models having the same thickness in\nNHI of 1014.73 cm\u22122 . Inspection of Fig. 6 shows that the solar\nmetallicity curve cannot reach the observed value of 0.9 while a\nslab of 10 Z\u2299 can again reproduce the target ratio. If the ionisation\nprocess, however, was dominated by collisional ionisation, then one\ncould not rule out solar metallicity. This is shown by the dashedline in Fig. 6 which represents a slab which is initially photoionised\nwith a low value of U but where the temperature is imposed. The\ntemperatures are increasing (starting from the equilibrium value of\n13000 K) in steps of 0.1 dex and collisional ionisation progressively\ntakes over. The open squares identify the first eight models, up to\n8.2 \u00d7 104 K. To show that the column ratio actually decreases at\nmuch higher temperatures, we used filled triangles to denote the\nmodels in which the temperature starts from 1.03 \u00d7 105 K and increases in steps of 0.1 dex. We have verified that, as expected, the\npeak reached in the column ratio is not higher for a slab with higher\nionisation parameter (the peak is actually lower for U \u2265 0.01).\nWe infer from the above calculations that a solar metallicity\nwould therefore require an unusual fine tuning in order to give a\ntemperature which lies in the range of \u223c 0.7\u20131.4 \u00d7 105 K. This is\nnot a very probable state for any astrophysical plasma since this is\nexactly the same temperature range across which the cooling curve\nis known to peak (e.g. Fig. 8 in Ferruit et al. 1997). For the gas to\nbe maintained in this temperature range would require an additional\n(unknown) heating mechanism. Cooling shocks can in principle reproduce the observed C IV columns but the models so far computed\nindicate huge NHI columns \u223c 1019 cm\u22122 (see Table 2D in Dopita\n& Sutherland 1996), a value which is many orders of magnitude\nbeyond the observed value for absorber #2 of 1014.73 cm\u22122 . For\nthese reasons, it appears to us more plausible to invoke metal-rich\nabsorbing gas.\nTherefore, although the value of \u0393 in 0200+015 (unlike 0943242 cf. B00) can be reconciled with a co-spatial distribution of\nabsorption- and emission-line gas, this is not our preferred scenario\ngiven the additional information, i.e. the fact that the emission has\nsuch a large FWHM as compared to the b values of the absorption\nprofiles and the near unity covering factor of the absorption gas.\nTherefore, the original conclusions of B00 still hold in which the\nabsorption gas resides in a shell-like distribution, but we are now in\na situation where the metallicity and the density of the absorption\nshells varies from shell-to-shell in the same source and also from\nsource-to-source.\nR L\u03bd\nU = 4\u03c0rQ\nd\u03bd, r is the distance to the cloud from\n2 c n , where Q =\nh\u03bd\nthe ionising source and n is the particle density.\n3\n\nFigure 6.

The lower and upper curves correspond to gas with\nsolar and 10 times solar metallicity, respectively. The dashed-line corresponds to models whose temperature has been increased in steps starting\nfrom the equilibrium value of 13000 K (open squares for T \u2264 82000 K,\nfilled triangles at higher T ). The NCIV /NHI column ratio actually decreases when the temperature exceeds 105 K. All models correspond to\nslabs for which the NHI column is 1014.73 cm\u22122 as in 0200+015 (absorber #2 in Table 2). The dotted horizontal line represents the observed\nvalue of NCIV /NHI ratio in 0200+015.\n\n6 DISCUSSION\n6.1 Origin of the absorbing shells\nIn this section we speculate on the origin of the large absorption\nshells around HzRGs.\n\n6.1.1 Shells propagated by the passage of radio jets\nThe evidence presented in this paper suggests that the absorbing\nshells surround the whole of the radio source and probably have a\nroughly spherical distribution. If this is the case then it is extremely\nunlikely that the shells are propagated by the passage of the radio\nemission for which we would expect the shells to be disrupted at\nradii less than the extent of the radio emission. The fact that we see\nthe absorption systems in the majority of the smaller radio galaxies\n(projected linear size D < 50 kpc) but not in the larger sources\n(e.g. van Ojik et al. 1997) makes this scenario very unlikely. We\nalso observe the absorption systems along the line-of-sight to the\nnucleus. Given that radio galaxies are orientated along the plane of\nthe sky according to orientation based unified schemes, then this\nalso rules out the scenario of a radio jet propagated shell.\n\n6.1.2 Starburst driven superwinds\nOne explanation is that the shells originate at the centre of the\ngalaxy and are ejected by superwinds, like those seen in Lyman\nBreak galaxies (e.g. Steidel 2001). These winds will propagate\n\n\f8\n\nJarvis et al.\n\nroughly spherically, provide an explanation of the enriched nature\nof the shells and have no problem in explaining the number of\nshells and the diverse metallicities if the starburst driven winds are\nepisodic.\nEvidence is mounting that powerful radio galaxies are formed\nat an early epoch and the triggering of the AGN activity is synchronized with a major episode of star formation (e.g. Archibald et al.\n2001; Willott et al. 2002; Baker et al. 2002). Therefore, it seems\nlikely that starburst driven superwinds may be an important mechanism for ejecting gas out of the central regions and the high dust\nconcentrations inferred from submillimetre observations imply that\nstarburst may easily be obscured at UV and optical wavelengths.\nMartin (1999) and Heckman et al. (2000) estimated the outflow speeds of superwinds for galaxies of varying mass. They show\nthat the outflow speed is largely independent of galaxy mass, implying that the outflows preferentially escape less massive halos. Highredshift radio galaxies seem only to be found in the most massive\nelliptical galaxies at any redshift (e.g. Jarvis et al. 2001b), hence\npresumably the deepest potential wells. If this is the case then unlike the case for L\u22c6 and sub-L\u22c6 galaxies the winds may not possess\nthe required velocity to fully escape the deep potential well and\nsubsequently enrich the intergalactic medium beyond the confines\nof the HzRG dark halo. Instead this enriched material resides at\nlarge radii, away from the central cusp, but still within the potential\nwell of the galaxy.\nIn the event of episodic superwinds, these shells would eventually collide at large radii, which could both deplete or increase\nthe metallicity of the most distant shell depending on the composition of the wind. If this is the case then these shells will eventually\nfall back towards the centre of the shell in the absence of a repulsive force. Indeed, with reference to Tables 1 and 2, there is a slight\ntendency for the Ly\u03b1 absorbers in 0200+015 to have lower neutral column densities and b-parameters as the absorption redshift\n(zabs ) increases. If the difference between zabs and the redshift of\nthe emission line peak reflects outflow of the shell relative to the radio galaxy, this trend could reflect evolution in the ionisation state\nand internal structure of the shells as they are ejected from the radio\ngalaxy.\nThis is in line with an initial major burst of star formation\nin which much of the gas is expelled, subsequently followed by\nsmaller bursts in which the lower velocity, lower-density shells are\nexpelled. At some stage in the evolution these shells would fall\nback under gravity and the shells would merge, but this process is\nprobably very rare because the radio jet has already disrupted the\noutermost shells which are now seen in emission. However, it is\ndifficult to reconcile the low metallicity shells in 0943-242 with a\nstarburst scenario, as we would expect much higher enrichment if\nthe shells originate in a starburst driven superwind. Although this\nis not the case for the high metallicity shell in 0200+015.\n\n6.1.3 Relics from a gas-rich merger\nMetal enriched shells of low-density gas could be a relic from a\ngas-rich merger in which there was an episode of star-formation,\npresumably induced by the merger. This scenario has been used to\nexplain the vast HI shells in low-redshift elliptical galaxies (e.g.\nSahu et al. 1996; Morganti et al. 1997).\nA number of numerical investigations predict that the outer\nregions of a galactic halo should be less metal rich than the central\nregions (e.g. Bekki 1998). This is in line with the case of 0943242 but in opposition to the case of 0200+015 in which the main\n\nabsorber is highly enriched and is comparable in metallicity to that\nexpected in the narrow-emission line region towards the centre.\nAn argument against the merger relic scenario is that the efficiency of mergers depends critically on the relative velocities, with\nlow velocity mergers being the most efficient. This means that these\nefficient mergers would produce very low velocity dispersions in\nthe absorbing gas. We might also expect the low density halo resulting from a gas-rich merger to have a more filamentary structure\nwith a covering factor less than unity, which although reconcilable\nwith our observations of a unity covering factor along our line-ofsight, is not the most plausible explanation. Therefore although a\ngas-rich merger remains a candidate for producing the extended\nlow-metallicity haloes it has difficulties in producing the enriched\nshell we see in 0200+015 and probably needs a very specific merging scenario.\n\n6.1.4 Gas-rich clusters and cooling flows\nIt is now well established that many powerful radio galaxies reside\nin significant galaxies overdensities at all cosmic epochs (e.g. Hill\n& Lilly 1991; McLure & Dunlop 2001; Best 2001; Pentericci et\nal. 2000). Indeed, the discovery of \u223c 20 Ly\u03b1 emitters around a\nz = 4.1 radio galaxy (Venemans et al. 2002) suggests that powerful radio galaxies are ideal beacons for tracing proto-clusters in the\nearly Universe. If this is ubiquitous for all powerful radio galaxies then we might expect large reservoirs of gas around the radio\ngalaxy.\nWithin a cluster, cooling flows provide a mechanism for depositing substantial amounts of cool gas and dust around the central galaxy (e.g. Edge 2001). The observational consequences of a\nradio source being triggered at the centre of such a cooling flow\ncluster at high redshift were discussed by Bremer et al. (1997).\nOne of their clearest predictions concerns the presence of HI absorption in the Ly\u03b1 emission in systems seen as radio galaxies (as\nopposed to radio-loud quasars): to see absorption from an ensemble of clouds requires a covering fraction of at least 50 per cent;\nlittle absorption is expected from clouds at radii of 10\u2013100 kpc, as\ntheir covering fraction is low, but those between 10\u201320 kpc provide a covering fraction of order unity and absorbing HI columns\nof 1018 \u2212 1021 cm\u22122 , as the surrounding gas away from the ionising beam should be similar to that of the interstellar medium before the nucleus became active.. This would account for the absorption in 0943-242 where the radio source has a projected linear\nsize \u223c 26 kpc; in 0200+015, however, the radio source is larger\n(\u223c 43 kpc) and has already engulfed these high-covering factor\nclouds, so the absorbers in this object may have been disrupted.\nHowever, the classical view of a cooling flow, from lowredshift studies is almost certainly not applicable at these high redshifts. The main reason for this is that the environmental gas may\nnot have had time to both settle towards hydrostatic equilibrium and\nalso to be heated up to X-ray temperatures. In the low-redshift Universe cooling flows also have an inclination to produce filaments\nwhen the gas cools (e.g. Fabian et al. 1981), which would result\nin a much reduced covering factor (\u226a 1; see e.g. Conselice, Gallagher & Wyse 2001). Therefore, a possibly more accurate view is\none in which the pristine gas is collapsing and cooling in a more\nglobally ordered fashion, i.e. as a spherical collapse. In this case\nthe resulting gaseous distribution would be different from that in\na low-redshift cooling flow and have the observed high covering\nfactors.\n\n\fVLT-UVES observations of two HzRGs\n6.2 A scenario: deposition of pristine gas and triggered star\nformation\nAn age based scenario, which assumes that both the AGN activity\nand a major episode of star formation are synchronized, probably\ndue to the collapse and cooling of (proto-)cluster gas (or a gasrich merger), may explain the differences in the absorption shells of\n0200+015 and 0943-242. The projected linear size D, of the radio\nemission may be used as an age indicator for the radio source (e.g.\nBlundell, Rawlings & Willott 1999; Baker et al. 2002). In this case\n0200+015 (D \u223c 43 kpc) is older than 0943\u2013242 (D \u223c 26 kpc).\nIf this is the case then there is much more time for the absorption\nshells to have evolved in 0200+015. An indication of this comes\nfrom the interaction of the radio emitting plasma in the extended\ncomponent in 0200+015, which looks to be disrupting the absorption shells and subsequently producing additional emission.\nIf starburst or quasar driven winds precede the passage of the\nradio activity then a pristine halo at large radii will be enriched\nby the winds before the radio plasma propagates through the extended regions. Indeed, in an investigation of the metallicity of the\nbroad-line region in quasars, Hamann et al. (2002) compared the\nUV emission line ratios in a sample of radio-quiet quasars with\ntheoretical models. They found the broad-line region gas was most\nlikely to be of high metallicity (Z > Z\u2299 ) and was a consequence\nof rapid star formation triggered at or before the time of the quasar\nactivity. Ejection of the gas via a quasar or starburst driven outflow\nwould obviously enrich the surrounding halo and thus offer an explanation of the highly enriched nature of absorber #2 in 0200+015.\nIn the case of 0943\u2013242 any starburst driven wind associated\nwith the activation of the nucleus may not have had time to enrich\nthe outer halo. Thus the explanation of Binette et al. (2000) still\nholds for this source, in which the shell has a very low-metallicity.\nThis would also explain the variety of metallicities observed\nin these shells, as some of the shells will have been enriched, while\nthe winds have not yet reached the others. This naturally fits in with\nthe absorption lines in 0200+015, in which the the blueshifted (absorber #2) shell has a high metallicity, whereas absorbers #3 and\n#4 lie redward of the Ly\u03b1 emission line and are probably infalling\ncomponents from the (proto-)cluster environment, in which there\nhas been little or no star formation to enrich the shells. This is also\nin line with the work of Overzier et al. (2001) in which the metallicity gradient in the emission-line gas in the gaseous halo surrounding\nMRC2104-242 may also arise from the same mechanism.\nThe fate of the shells is uncertain, it is not implausible that\nshredding by the passage of the radio jet (e.g. Bremer et al. 1997)\nwill work to condense the shells into distinct clouds that may resemble the knots of emission-line gas observed in many larger radio sources. This naturally fits in with correlation between the extent of the emission-line gas and the extent of the radio emission\n(e.g. Jarvis et al. 2001a), with the radio emitting plasma propagating through the low-density gas which consequently increases the\ndensity of this gas resulting in detectable line emission.\n\n6.3 The link to quasars\nUsing a complete sample of radio-loud quasars from the Molonglo Quasar Catalogue (Kapahi et al. 1998), Baker et al. (2002) used\nboth the Hubble Space Telescope with STIS and ground based telescopes to investigate the associated C IV absorption in two redshift\nintervals. They found that the absorbing systems in these objects\nhave similar velocities widths and offsets to the two radio galaxies\ninvestigated in this paper, the gas is mixed with a large amount of\n\n9\n\ndust and that the gas and dust dissipate over the lifetime of the radio source. Thus, the main conclusions from this study fit in easily\nwith our results, in line with Unified schemes.\nThe advantage that radio galaxies hold over quasars is that, according to unified schemes, the radio galaxies are orientated along\nthe plane of the sky and so the deprojection to the true linear size of\nthe radio source is trivial. Therefore, age effects may become more\napparent in a large sample of radio galaxies with higher signalto-noise observations. This should easily be achievable with current instrumentation as we have shown that spectra of resolution\nof \u223c 2\u00c5 at these redshifts is sufficient to probe the absorption\nshells to the required detail allowing the integration time to be significantly reduced. Combined with a similar sample of radio-loud\nquasars, in which the reddening properties may be explored, we\nshould be able to track the evolution of both the absorption- and\nemission-line gas and the intrinsic dust properties in all radio-loud\nAGN.\n\n6.4 Further observations\nObviously further observations of the sources studied in the paper\nwill enhance our understanding of the origin and fate of the gas surrounding HzRGs. Indeed, deep spectroscopy around other resonant\nlines may provide critical information regarding the state of the absorbing shells. The most obvious emission line to use for this study\nwould be the MgII \u03bb\u03bb2795,2802 doublet. The absorption equivalent width ratio of C IV/MgII is frequently used to classify quasar\nabsorbers into high or low excitation (e.g. Bergeron et al. 1994)\nand will also provide further information regarding the metallicity\nof the gas.\n0200+015 is also at a redshift in which the H\u03b1 emission line\nis redshifted into the near-infrared K\u2212band transmission window.\nAs H\u03b1 is not a resonant line the true velocity structure of the Ly\u03b1\nline should be replicated in H\u03b1, thus allowing a detailed study of\nthe actual kinematics of the emission-line gas. The Ly\u03b1/H\u03b1 ratio\nis also sensitive to reddening by dust, and if the Ly\u03b1 photons escape from the clouds via resonant scattering from HI, the Ly\u03b1 line\nshould have significantly broader wings than that of H\u03b1.\nFinally, spectroscopic observations around various resonant\nline of a large sample of high-redshift radio galaxies spanning projected linear sizes from D \u223c1-2 kpc up to the classical doubles\nwith D >\n\u223c 100 kpc are warranted. These will shed further light on\nthe distribution, density and metallicity of gas in the environments\nof the most massive galaxies at high redshift, and provide clues as\nto the origin and fate of these large gaseous halos, and may consequently provide important clues to galaxy formation in general and\nthe important role that feedback may play.\n\n7 CONCLUSIONS\nWe have obtained high-resolution spectra of two high-redshift radio galaxies to determine the structure of the absorption gas which\nappears to be ubiquitous in small (D < 50 kpc) radio sources. The\nmain conclusions of this study can be summarized as follows:\n\u2022 The higher resolution observations do not uncover significant\nstructure in the absorbers of both Ly\u03b1 and CIV in 0943-242, however the NHI \u223c 1019 cm\u22122 absorber in 0200+015 split into two\nabsorber of NHI \u223c 4 \u00d7 1014 cm\u22122 . The absorption gas present\nin our two chosen high-redshift radio sources is most likely distributed in shell-like structures which encompass the radio source.\n\n\f10\n\nJarvis et al.\n\n\u2022 The metallicity of these absorption shells can vary between\nsources and also between the shells in the same sources, implying\nthat the shells are enriched by a secondary process.\n\u2022 We speculate that the most plausible origin of the absorbing\nshells is two fold. The pristine shells are the relics from a gas-rich\nmerger or (proto-)cluster gas which has cooled and collapsed towards the centre of the dark matter halo. Whereas the enrichment\ncomes at a later stage when the AGN is triggered simultaneously\nwith a major episode of star formation, presumably due to a large\ninflow of gas into the nucleus. This major burst of star formation\ninitiates starburst driven superwinds which drive the gas toward the\nouter halo of the galaxy and may explain the very high metallicity\nof the absorption shells in 0200+015.\n\u2022 The passage of the radio emitting plasma disrupts and fragments the absorption shells in the larger, and thus older radio\nsources. Evidence of this is seen in 0200+015, where the absorption\nscreen along our line-of-sight to the radio lobe appears to be more\nfragmented than the absorbing screen between us and the nuclear\nemission.\n\u2022 We have found direct evidence that the narrow-emission lines\nin high-redshift radio sources may be outflowing from the central\nregions. This is in agreement with previous studies of the narrowemission line dynamics in nearby Seyfert galaxies and is in line\nwith orientation based Unified Schemes in which the outflow from\nthe far side of the source is obscured by dust.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe thank the staff at the Paranal Observatory for their excellent\nsupport and Sandro D'Odorico for help with the preparation for the\nUVES observations.
