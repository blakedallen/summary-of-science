Let M be a closed 4-manifold with a free circle action. If the orbit manifold\nN 3 satisfies an appropriate fibering condition, then we show how to represent a cone\nin H 2 (M ; R) by symplectic forms. This generalizes earlier constructions by Thurston,\nBouyakoub and Fern\u00e1ndez-Gray-Morgan. In the case that M is the product 4-manifold\nS 1 \u00d7 N our construction complements the results of [FV08] and allows us to completely\ndetermine the symplectic cone of such 4-manifolds.\n\n1. Introduction and main results\nLet M be a closed 4\u2013manifold with a free circle action. We denote the orbit space by N\nand we denote by p : M \u2192 N the quotient map, which defines a principal S 1 \u2013bundle over\nN . We denote by p\u2217 : H 2 (M ; R) \u2192 H 1 (N ; R) the map given by integration along the fiber.\nOur main result (which will be proved in Section 2) is the following existence theorem.\nTheorem 1.1. Let M be a closed, oriented 4\u2013manifold admitting a free circle action. Let\n\u03c8 \u2208 H 2 (M ; R) such that \u03c8 2 > 0 \u2208 H 4 (M ; R) and such that p\u2217 (\u03c8) \u2208 H 1 (N ; R) can be represented by a non\u2013degenerate closed 1\u2013form. Then there exists an S 1 \u2013invariant symplectic\nform \u03c9 on M with [\u03c9] = \u03c8 \u2208 H 2 (M ; R).\nRemark.\n(1) Note that given \u03c6 \u2208 H 1 (N ; R) we can represent \u03c6 by a non-degenerate\n(i.e. nowhere zero) closed 1\u2013form if and only if \u03c6 lies in the cone on a fibered face\nof the Thurston norm ball (see [Th86] for details). Therefore the theorem assumes\nimplicitly that N admits a fibration over S 1 .\n(2) This theorem generalizes work by Thurston [Th76], Bouyakoub [Bou88] and Fern\u00e1ndezGray-Morgan [FGM91]. More precisely, Thurston first constructed symplectic forms\non product manifolds S 1 \u00d7 N for fibered 3-manifolds N . Bouyakoub generalized\nThurston's results and showed that given \u03c8 as in the theorem, there exists an S 1 \u2013\ninvariant symplectic form \u03c9 with p\u2217 ([\u03c9]) = p\u2217 (\u03c8). Finally Fern\u00e1ndez-Gray-Morgan\nproved the theorem in the case that p\u2217 (\u03c8) is rational.\nLet W be a 4\u2013manifold. The set of all elements of H 2 (W ; R) which can be represented\nby a symplectic form is called the symplectic cone of W . Note that this is indeed a cone,\ni.e. if \u03c8 can be represented by a symplectic form, then any non-zero scalar multiple can also\nbe represented by a symplectic form. Determining the symplectic cone of 4-manifolds is a\nfundamental problem, but little seems to be known in general. We refer to [Li08, Section 3]\nfor more information.\nDate: August 22, 2018.\nThe second author was partially supported by NSF grant #0906281.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nSTEFAN FRIEDL AND STEFANO VIDUSSI\n\nIn [FV08] the authors showed that if N is a closed 3-manifold, then S 1 \u00d7 N is symplectic\nif and only if N fibers over S 1 . (In the case that b1 (N ) = 1 this also follows from combining\nthe work of Kutluhan-Taubes [KT09] with the work of Kronheimer-Mrowka [KM08] and Ni\n[Ni08]). In fact, a slightly more precise version of this result (see [FV08, Theorem 1.3]) will\nallows us in Section 3 to determine the symplectic cone of closed 4-manifolds of the form\nS1 \u00d7 N :\nTheorem 1.2. Let N be a closed, oriented 3\u2013manifold. Then given \u03c8 \u2208 H 2 (S 1 \u00d7 N ; R) the\nfollowing are equivalent:\n(1) \u03c8 can be represented by a symplectic structure,\n(2) \u03c8 can be represented by a symplectic structure which is S 1 \u2013invariant,\n(3) \u03c8 2 > 0 and the K\u00fcnneth component \u03c6 = p\u2217 (\u03c8) \u2208 H 1 (N ; R) of \u03c8 lies in the open\ncone on a fibered face of the Thurston norm ball of N .\nRemark.\n(1) Note that we are not claiming that any symplectic form is isotopic, or even\nhomotopic to an S 1 \u2013invariant form, although this might be the case.\n(2) We expect a very similar theorem to hold for closed 4-manifold with a free circle\naction. In fact the proof of Theorem 1.2 together with work of Bowden [Bow09]\nand the authors [FV07] shows that an analogous statement holds for circle bundles\nM \u2192 N whenever N has vanishing Thurston norm or N is a graph manifold.\nConvention. All maps are assumed to be C \u221e unless stated otherwise. All manifolds are\nassumed to be connected, compact, closed and orientable. All homology and cohomology\ngroups are with integral coefficients, unless it says specifically otherwise.\nNote. This paper is one section of an unpublished 2007 preprint by the authors called\n'Symplectic 4-manifolds with a free circle action'.\nAcknowledgment. We would like to thank Paolo Ghiggini and Ko Honda for helpful\nconversations.\n2. Construction of symplectic forms\n2.1. Outline of the proof of Theorem 1.1. In this section we will give a proof of\nTheorem 1.1 modulo some technical lemmas which will be proved in Sections 2.2, 2.3 and\n2.4.\nFor the remainder of this section let M be an oriented 4\u2013manifold admitting a free S 1 action. We denote the orbit space by N and we denote by p : M \u2192 N the quotient map,\nwhich defines a principal S 1 \u2013bundle over N .\nIn the following we denote by e \u2208 H 2 (N ) the Euler class of the S 1 \u2013bundle M \u2192 N .\n(Note that M decomposes as a product M = S 1 \u00d7 N if and only if e = 0.) Recall the Gysin\nsequence\n(1)\n\n*e\n\np\u2217\n\np\u2217\n\n\u222ae\n\nZ = H 0 (N ; R) \u2212\n\u2192 H 2 (N ; R) \u2212\u2192 H 2 (M ; R) \u2212\u2192 H 1 (N ; R) \u2212\u2192 H 3 (N ; R) = R.\n\nHere p\u2217 : H 2 (M ; R) \u2192 H 1 (N ; R) is the map given by integration along the fiber. The same\nsequence can be considered for cohomology with integral coefficients. Note that the map\n\n\fSYMPLECTIC STRUCTURES ON 4\u2013MANIFOLDS WITH A FREE CIRCLE ACTION\n\n3\n\np\u2217 : H 4 (M ) \u2192 H 3 (N ) is an isomorphism, and we endow N with the orientation given by\nthe image of the orientation of M under p\u2217 .\nThroughout this section we assume that \u03c8 \u2208 H 2 (M ; R) is such that \u03c8 2 > 0 \u2208 H 4 (M ; R)\nand such that p\u2217 (\u03c8) \u2208 H 1 (N ; R) can be represented by a non\u2013degenerate closed 1\u2013form \u03b1.\nLemma 2.1. There exists a 1\u2013form \u03b2 on N such that \u03b1 \u2227 \u03b2 is closed and [\u03b2 \u2227 \u03b1] = e \u2208\nH 2 (N ; R).\nIn the case that p\u2217 (\u03c8) is integral this lemma is stated in [FGM91, Lemma 15]. We give\nthe proof of Lemma 2.1 in Section 2.3.\nNow let \u03b3 = \u03b2 \u2227\u03b1. Since [\u03b3] = e \u2208 H 2 (N ; R) we can find a 1\u2013form \u03b7 (namely a connection\n1\u2013form for M \u2192 N ) on M with the following properties:\n(1) \u03b7 is invariant under the S 1 \u2013action,\n(2) the integral of \u03b7 over a fiber (which inherits an orientation from S 1 ) equals 1, and\n(3) d\u03b7 = p\u2217 (\u03b3).\nThis form is often referred to as global angular form. We refer to [BT82] for more details.\nNote that (1) and (2) imply that \u03b7 is non\u2013trivial on any non\u2013trivial vector tangent to a\nfiber.\nNote that d(p\u2217 (\u03b1) \u2227 \u03b7) = p\u2217 (\u03b1 \u2227 \u03b3) = p\u2217 (\u03b1 \u2227 \u03b1 \u2227 \u03b2) = 0. We can therefore consider\n\u03c8 \u2212 [p\u2217 (\u03b1) \u2227 \u03b7] \u2208 H 2 (M\u0001; R). It follows easily from p\u2217 (\u03c8) = [\u03b1] and the second property of \u03b7\nthat p\u2217 \u03c8 \u2212 [p\u2217 (\u03b1) \u2227 \u03b7] = 0 \u2208 H 1 (N ; R). By the exact sequence (1) we can therefore find\nh \u2208 H 2 (N ; R) with p\u2217 (h) = \u03c8 \u2212 [p\u2217 (\u03b1) \u2227 \u03b7]. By assumption we have \u03c8 2 > 0. Note that\n\u03c8 2 = (p\u2217 (h) + [p\u2217 (\u03b1) \u2227 \u03b7]) \u222a (p\u2217 (h) + [p\u2217 (\u03b1) \u2227 \u03b7])\n= p\u2217 (h2 ) + [p\u2217 (\u03b1) \u2227 \u03b7] \u222a [p\u2217 (\u03b1) \u2227 \u03b7] + 2p\u2217 (h) \u222a [p\u2217 (\u03b1) \u2227 \u03b7]\n= p\u2217 (h2 ) + [p\u2217 (\u03b1) \u2227 \u03b7 \u2227 p\u2217 (\u03b1) \u2227 \u03b7] + 2p\u2217 (h) \u222a [p\u2217 (\u03b1) \u2227 \u03b7].\nThe first term is zero since N supports no 4-forms and the second term is zero since \u03b7 and\np\u2217 (\u03b1) are one-forms. It follows that\n1\np\u2217 (h) \u222a [p\u2217 (\u03b1) \u2227 \u03b7] = \u03c8 2 > 0 \u2208 H 4 (M ; R).\n2\nRecall that the map p\u2217 : H 4 (M ; R) \u2192 H 3 (N ; R) is an orientation preserving isomorphism.\nIn particular we therefore get that\nh \u222a [\u03b1] = p\u2217 (p\u2217 (h) \u222a [p\u2217 (\u03b1) \u2227 \u03b7]) > 0 \u2208 H 3 (N ; R).\nWe will prove the following lemma in Section 2.4.\nLemma 2.2. Given h \u2208 H 2 (N ; R) with h \u222a [\u03b1] > 0 we can find a representative \u03a9 of h\nsuch that \u03a9 \u2227 \u03b1 > 0 everywhere.\nIt is now clear that the following claim concludes the proof of Theorem 1.1.\nClaim.\n\u03c9 = p\u2217 (\u03a9) + p\u2217 (\u03b1) \u2227 \u03b7\nis an S 1 \u2013invariant symplectic form on M which represents \u03c8.\n\n\f4\n\nSTEFAN FRIEDL AND STEFANO VIDUSSI\n\nIt is clear that \u03c9 is S 1 \u2013invariant. We compute\nd\u03c9 = d(p\u2217 (\u03a9) + p\u2217 (\u03b1) \u2227 \u03b7) = p\u2217 (\u03b1) \u2227 d\u03b7 = p\u2217 (\u03b1 \u2227 \u03b3) = p\u2217 (\u03b1 \u2227 \u03b1 \u2227 \u03b2) = 0,\ni.e. \u03c9 is closed. Also note that\n\u03c8 = p\u2217 (h) + [p\u2217 (\u03b1) \u2227 \u03b7] = [p\u2217 (\u03a9) + p\u2217 (\u03b1) \u2227 \u03b7],\ni.e. \u03c9 represents \u03c8. It remains to show that \u03c9 \u2227 \u03c9 is positive everywhere. For any point\nq \u2208 M pick a basis a, b, c, d for the tangent space Tq M such that:\n(1) p\u2217 (a), p\u2217 (b) are a basis for the tangent space ker\u03b1|p(q) of a leaf of the foliation on\nN determined by \u03b1; put differently, \u03b1(p\u2217 (a)) = \u03b1(p\u2217 (b)) = 0 and p\u2217 (a), p\u2217 (b) are\nlinearly independent,\n(2) \u03b1(p\u2217 (c)) > 0,\n(3) d is tangent to the fibers of the S 1 \u2013fibration M \u2192 N and \u03b7(d) > 0.\nNote that p\u2217 (d) = 0 and p\u2217 (\u03b1) vanishes on a, b, d. It is now easy to see that\n(\u03c9 \u2227 \u03c9)(a, b, c, d) = 2(p\u2217 (\u03a9) \u2227 p\u2217 (\u03b1) \u2227 \u03b7)(a, b, c, d)\n= 2p\u2217 (\u03a9)(a, b) * p\u2217 (\u03b1)(c) * \u03b7(d) = 2\u03a9(p\u2217 (a), p\u2217 (b)) * \u03b1(p\u2217 (c)) * \u03b7(d)\n= 2(\u03a9 \u2227 \u03b1)(p\u2217 (a), p\u2217 (b), p\u2217 (c)) * \u03b7(d).\nSince \u03a9 \u2227 \u03b1 is a non-zero 3-form and since p\u2217 (a), p\u2217 (b), p\u2217 (c) form a basis for the tangent\nspace of N we see that the last expression is in fact non-zero. This shows that \u03c9 \u2227 \u03c9 is\nnon-zero everywhere, but since \u03c9 \u2227 \u03c9 represents the positive class \u03c8 2 we see that \u03c9 \u2227 \u03c9 is\nin fact positive throughout. This concludes the proof of the claim and hence the proof of\nTheorem 1.1\n2.2. Non\u2013degenerate closed 1\u2013forms and dual curves. Throughout this section \u03b1\nwill be a non\u2013degenerate closed 1\u2013form on N . Note that \u03b1 (or strictly speaking Ker(\u03b1))\ndefines a foliation which we denote by F. Before we can prove Lemmas 2.1 and 2.2 we\nneed a preliminary result regarding representability of homology classes in N by smooth\nembedded curves transverse to, or contained in a leaf of, the foliation F. The following\nLemma is presumably known (its existence is discussed e.g. in [Lt87]) but we include a\nproof for completeness.\nLemma 2.3. Let \u03b1 be a non\u2013degenerate closed 1\u2013form on N with corresponding foliation\nF and let p \u2208 N . For every h \u2208 H 2 (N ; Z) with h \u222a [\u03b1] 6= 0 (respectively, h \u222a [\u03b1] = 0)\nthere exists a smoothly embedded closed (possibly disconnected) curve c with P D([c]) = h\ntransverse to (respectively, contained in a leaf of ) the foliation F and that goes through p.\nProof. Let \u03b1 be a non\u2013degenerate closed 1\u2013form on N with corresponding foliation F. We\nfirst pick a metric g on N . We let v \u2032 be the unique vector field on N with the property that\nfor any p \u2208 N and any w \u2208 Tp N we have g(v \u2032 (p), w) = \u03b1(w). Note that this implies that\n\u03b1(v \u2032 (p)) 6= 0 for all p. We then define a new vector field v by\nv(p) =\n\nv \u2032 (p)\n.\n\u03b1(v \u2032 (p))\n\n\fSYMPLECTIC STRUCTURES ON 4\u2013MANIFOLDS WITH A FREE CIRCLE ACTION\n\n5\n\nNote that \u03b1(v(p)) = 1 for all p \u2208 N .

Proof of Lemma 2.1. We are now ready to prove the first of the two auxiliary\nlemmas, i.e. we will prove the following claim.\nClaim. Let \u03b1 be a non\u2013degenerate closed 1\u2013form on N and e \u2208 H 2 (N ; Z) such that e\u222a[\u03b1] =\n0. There exists a 1\u2013form \u03b2 on N such that \u03b1 \u2227 \u03b2 is closed and [\u03b2 \u2227 \u03b1] = e \u2208 H 2 (N ; R).\nBy Lemma 2.3 we can find an oriented smoothly embedded curve c dual to e \u2208 H 2 (N ; Z)\nsuch that \u03b1|c \u2261 0. We denote the components of c by c1 , . . . , cm . We now consider S 1 \u00d7 D 2\nwith the coordinates e2\u03c0it , x, y and we orient S 1 \u00d7 D 2 by picking the equivalence class of\nthe basis {\u2202x , \u2202y , \u2202t }.\nUsing the orientability of the N and of the leaves of the foliation we use a standard\nargument to show that for i = 1, . . . , m we can pick a map\nfi : S 1 \u00d7 D 2 \u2192 N\nwith the following properties:\n(1) fi is an orientation preserving diffeomorphism onto its image.\n(2) fi restricted to S 1 \u00d7 0 is an orientation preserving diffeomorphism onto ci .\n(3) \u03b1((fi )\u2217 (\u2202t )) = 0.\n(4) \u03b1((fi )\u2217 (\u2202x )) = 0.\n(5) There exists an ri \u2208 (0, \u221e) such that \u03b1((fi )\u2217 (\u2202y )) = ri everywhere.\nNote that (3), (4) and (5) are equivalent to fi\u2217 (\u03b1) = ri * dy.\nFor i = 1, . . . , m we now pick a function \u03c1i : D 2 \u2192 R\u22650 such that the closure of the\nsupport of \u03c1i lies in the interior of D 2 and such that\nZ\n1\n\u03c1i (x, y)dx \u2227 dy = .\nri\nD2\nWe define the following 1\u2013form on S 1 \u00d7 D 2 :\n\u03b2i\u2032 (t, x, y) = \u03c1i (x, y) * dx.\nNote that\n(4)\n\nd(\u03b2i\u2032 \u2227 fi\u2217 (\u03b1)) = d(\u03b2i\u2032 \u2227 ri * dy) = d(ri \u03c1i (x, y) * dx \u2227 dy) = 0.\n\n\fSYMPLECTIC STRUCTURES ON 4\u2013MANIFOLDS WITH A FREE CIRCLE ACTION\n\nFurthermore for any z \u2208 S 1 we have\nZ\nZ\n\u03b2i\u2032 \u2227 fi\u2217 (\u03b1) =\n(5)\n\nz\u00d7D 2\n\nz\u00d7D 2\n\n7\n\nri \u03c1i (x, y) * dx \u2227 dy = 1.\n\nFor i = 1, . . . , m we now define the following 1\u2013form on N :\n\u001a\n0, if p \u2208 N \\ fi (S 1 \u00d7 D 2 )\n\u03b2i (p) =\n\u22121 \u2217 \u2032\n(fi ) (\u03b2i (q)), if p = fi (q) for some q \u2208 S 1 \u00d7 D 2 .\nP\nFurthermore we let \u03b2 = m\ni=1 \u03b2i . We claim that \u03b2 has all the required properties.\nFirst note that \u03b2 is C \u221e by our condition on the support of \u03c1i . Furthermore it follows\nimmediately from (4) that \u03b2 \u2227 \u03b1 is closed. Finally we have to show that \u03b2 \u2227 \u03b1 represents e.\nIn order to show that \u03b2 \u2227 \u03b1 represents e in H 2 (N ; R) = Hom(H2 (N ; Z), R) it is enough\nto show that for any embedded oriented surface S \u2282 N , we have\nZ\n\u03b2 \u2227 \u03b1 = e([S]).\nS\n\nWe first note that e([S]) = c * s. It is therefore enough to show that for any embedded\noriented surface S \u2282 N , we have\nZ\n\u03b2i \u2227 \u03b1 = ci * S.\nS\n\nIn fact, given such a surface we can isotope S in such a way that S intersects the curve c\n'vertically', i.e. we can assume that\nfi (S 1 \u00d7 D 2 ) \u2229 S =\n\nk\na\n\n\u01ebj * fi (z1 \u00d7 D 2 )\n\nj=1\n\nfor disjoint zi and \u01ebi \u2208 {\u22121, 1}. We view this equality as an equality of oriented manifolds,\nwhere we give zi \u00d7D 2 the orientation given by the basis {\u2202x , \u2202y }. In particular S is transverse\nto ci . In this case we have\nk\nX\n\u01ebj .\nci * S =\nj=1\n\nOn the other hand it follows from (5) that\nZ\n\nS\n\n\u03b2i \u2227 \u03b1 =\n\nk Z\nX\nj=1\n\n\u01ebj *(zj \u00d7D 2 )\n\nfi\u2217 (\u03b2i ) \u2227 fi\u2217 (\u03b1)\n\n=\n\nk Z\nX\nj=1\n\n\u01ebj *(zj \u00d7D 2 )\n\n\u03b2i\u2032\n\n\u2227\n\nfi\u2217 (\u03b1)\n\n=\n\nk\nX\n\n\u01ebj .\n\nj=1\n\nThis concludes the proof that \u03b2 has all the required properties.\n2.4. Proof of Lemma 2.2. The following claim is the last missing piece in the proof of\nTheorem 1.1.\nClaim. Let \u03b1 be a non\u2013degenerate closed 1\u2013form on N . Given h \u2208 H 2 (N ; R) with h\u222a[\u03b1] > 0\nwe can find a representative \u03a9 of h such that \u03a9 \u2227 \u03b1 > 0 everywhere.\n\n\f8\n\nSTEFAN FRIEDL AND STEFANO VIDUSSI\n\nWe first consider the case that h is represented by an integral class, i.e. by an element in\nthe image of the map H 2 (N ; Z) \u2192 H 2 (N ; R). Let F be the foliation corresponding to \u03b1.\nUsing Lemma 2.3 we can pick for each p \u2208 N a curve cp transverse to F which goes\nthrough p and which represents h. Since N is orientable we can pick maps\nfp : S 1 \u00d7 D 2 \u2192 N\nsuch that\n(1) fp is an orientation preserving diffeomorphism onto its image (where we again view\nS 1 \u00d7 D 2 with the orientation given by {\u2202x , \u2202y , \u2202t }).\n(2) fp restricted to S 1 \u00d7 0 is an orientation preserving diffeomorphism onto cp .\n(3) \u03b1((fp )\u2217 (\u2202x )) = 0.\n(4) \u03b1((fp )\u2217 (\u2202y )) = 0.\n(5) \u03b1((fp )\u2217 (\u2202t )) > 0.\nNote that (3) and (4) are equivalent to saying that (fp )\u2217 (\u2202x ) and (fp )\u2217 (\u2202y ) are tangent to\nthe leaves of the foliation F. Also note that on S 1 \u00d7 D 2 we have dx \u2227 dy \u2227 (fp )\u2217 (\u03b1) 6= 0.\nBy compactness we can find p1 , . . . , pk such that\n(6)\n\nk\n[\n\nj=1\n\n1 \u0001\nfpi S 1 \u00d7 D 2 = N.\n2\n\nWe write fi = fpi , i = 1, . . . , k. Now we pick a function \u03c1 : D 2 \u2192 R\u22650 such that the\nfollowing conditions hold:\nR\n(1) D2 \u03c1 = k1 ,\n(2) \u03c1 is strictly positive on 12 D 2 , and\n(3) the closure of the support of \u03c1 lies in the interior of D 2 .\nLet \u03a9\u2032 be the 2\u2013form on S 1 \u00d7 D 2 given by\n\u03a9\u2032 (z, x, y) = \u03c1(x, y)dx \u2227 dy.\nR\nClearly \u03a9\u2032 is closed and for any z \u2208 S 1 we have z\u00d7D2 \u03a9\u2032 = k1 . For i = 1, . . . , k we now\ndefine the following 2\u2013form on N :\n\u001a\n0, if p \u2208 N \\ fi (S 1 \u00d7 D 2 )\n\u03a9i (p) =\n\u22121 \u2217\n\u2032\n(fi ) (\u03a9 (q)), if p = fi (q) for some q \u2208 S 1 \u00d7 D 2 .\nAs in the proof of Lemma 2.1 we see that \u03a9i is smooth, \u03a9i is closed and [\u03a9i ] = k1 h \u2208\nP\nH 2 (N ; R). Now let \u03a9(h) = ki=1 \u03a9i . Clearly [\u03a9(h)] = h \u2208 H 2 (N ; R), and it easily follows\nfrom (6) and all the other conditions that \u03a9(h) \u2227 \u03b1 > 0 everywhere.\nWe now turn to the general case, i.e. to the case that h \u2208 H 2 (N ; R) is not necessarily\nintegral.\nLemma 2.4. Let h \u2208 H 2 (N ; R) with h \u222a [\u03b1] > 0. Then we can find m \u2208 N,\nPmintegral\nh1 , . . . , hm and a1 , . . . , am \u2208 R\u22650 such that hi \u222a[\u03b1] > 0 for all i and such that h = i=1 ai hi .\n\nWe first show that Lemma 2.4 implies Lemma 2.2. Indeed, given h \u2208 H 2 (N ; R) with\nh \u222a [\u03b1] > 0 we pick integral h1 , . . . , hm and a1 , . . . , am \u2208 R\u22650 as above. Then we define\n\n\fSYMPLECTIC STRUCTURES ON 4\u2013MANIFOLDS WITH A FREE CIRCLE ACTION\n\n9\n\n\u03a9(h1 ), . . . , \u03a9(hm ) as above. We let\n\u03a9=\n\nm\nX\n\nai \u03a9(hi ).\n\nm\nX\n\nai \u03a9(hi ) \u2227 \u03b1 > 0\n\ni=1\n\nWe see that\n\u03a9(h) \u2227 \u03b1 =\n\ni=1\n\neverywhere. This concludes the proof of Lemma 2.2 assuming Lemma 2.4.\nWe now turn to the proof of Lemma 2.4. It is easy to see that we can pick a basis\ne1 , . . . , en for H 1 (N ; Q) such that ei \u222a [\u03b1] > 0 for all i = 1, . . . , m. We use this basis to\nidentify H 2 (N ; R) with Rn . We say that h \u2208 H 2 (N ; R) with h \u222a [\u03b1] > 0 has property (\u2217) if\nthere exists m \u2208 N, integral\nh1 , . . . , hm and a1 , . . . , am \u2208 R\u22650 such that hi \u222a [\u03b1] > 0 for all\nP\ni and such that h = m\na\nh\ni=1 i i . Note that if h1 , h2 have property (\u2217), then h1 + h2 also has\nproperty (\u2217).\nGiven m \u2208 {0, . . . , n} we now say P (m) holds if (\u2217) holds for all g = (g1 , . . . , gn ) \u2208\nH 2 (N ; R) = Rn with g1 , . . . , gm \u2208 Q. Clearly we have to show that P (0) holds. Note that\nP (n) holds since any rational element of H 2 (N ; R) is a non\u2013negative multiple of an integral\nelement.\nWe now show that P (m + 1) implies that P (m) holds as well. So assume P (m + 1) holds\nand that we have\ng = (g1 , . . . , gm , gm+1 , . . . , gn )\nwith g1 , . . . , gm \u2208 Q and h * [\u03b1] > 0. By continuity we can find r > 0 such that gm+1 \u2212 r \u2208 Q\nand with the property that\n(g1 , . . . , gm , gm+1 \u2212 r, . . . , gn ) * [\u03b1] > 0.\nWe write\n(g1 , . . . , gm , gm+1 , . . . , gn ) = (g1 , . . . , gm , gm+1 \u2212 r, . . . , gn ) + rem+1 .\nThe claim now follows from P (m + 1) and em+1 \u222a [\u03b1] > 0.\n3. Proof of Theorem 1.2\nWe first prove the following proposition.\nProposition 3.1. Let M be a 4\u2013manifold with a free circle action. Denote by p : M \u2192 N\nthe projection map to the orbit space. Assume that (N, p\u2217 ([\u03c9])) fibers over S 1 for any\nsymplectic form \u03c9 such that p\u2217 ([\u03c9]) is an integral class which is primitive in H 1 (N ; Z).\nThen for any symplectic form \u03c9 the class p\u2217 ([\u03c9]) \u2208 H 1 (N ; R) can be represented by a non\u2013\ndegenerate closed 1\u2013form.\nProof. First let \u03c9 be a symplectic form such that p\u2217 ([\u03c9]) \u2208 H 1 (N ; Q). We can find s \u2208 Q\nsuch that sp\u2217 ([\u03c9]) = p\u2217 ([s\u03c9]) is a primitive element in H 1 (N ). By assumption (N, sp\u2217 ([\u03c9]))\nfibers over S 1 , in particular sp\u2217 ([\u03c9]) (and hence p\u2217 ([\u03c9]) can be represented by a non\u2013\ndegenerate closed 1\u2013form.\nNow let \u03c9 be a symplectic form such that p\u2217 ([\u03c9]) \u2208 H 1 (N ; R) \\ H 1 (N ; Q), and let C be\nthe open cone over the face of the unit ball of the Thurston norm in which C lies. (Note\n\n\f10\n\nSTEFAN FRIEDL AND STEFANO VIDUSSI\n\nthat C is a priori not necessarily top dimensional.) Since the vertices of the Thurston norm\nball are rational (cf. [Th86, Section 2]), and by the openness of the symplectic condition,\nwe can find a symplectic form \u03c9 \u2032 on M such that p\u2217 ([\u03c9 \u2032 ]) is in H 1 (N ; Q) and is contained\nin the cone C as well. By the previous observation it follows that there exists at least one\nelement of C (namely p\u2217 ([\u03c9 \u2032 ]) itself) that can be represented by a non\u2013degenerate closed\n1\u2013form. But then by [Th86, Theorem 5] all elements in C, in particular p\u2217 ([\u03c9]), can be\nrepresented by non\u2013degenerate closed 1\u2013forms.\n\u0003\nWe can now prove Theorem 1.2.\nProof of Theorem 1.2. Let N be a closed oriented 3\u2013manifold and let \u03c8 \u2208 H 2 (S 1 \u00d7 N ; R).\nWe have to show that the following are equivalent:\n(1) \u03c8 can be represented by a symplectic structure;\n(2) \u03c8 can be represented by a symplectic structure which is S 1 \u2013invariant;\n(3) \u03c8 2 > 0 and the K\u00fcnneth component \u03c6 \u2208 H 1 (N ; R) of \u03c8 lies in the open cone on a\nfibered face of the Thurston norm ball of N .\nClearly (2) implies (1). Theorem 1.1 shows that (3) implies (2). By the results of [FV08,\nTheorems 1.2 and 1.4] we know that for any symplectic form \u03c9 with p\u2217 ([\u03c9]) \u2208 H 1 (N )\nprimitive the pair (N, p\u2217 ([\u03c9])) fibers over S 1 . (Note that this is stated only for integral forms\n[\u03c9] but the argument in [FV08] carries through for any [\u03c9] such that p\u2217 ([\u03c9]) is primitive.)\nProposition 3.1 then asserts that for any symplectic form \u03c9 the class p\u2217 ([\u03c9]) \u2208 H 1 (N ; R)\ncan be represented by a non\u2013degenerate closed 1\u2013form.\n\u0003\nTheorem 1.2 lets us determine the symplectic cone for a significant class of 4\u2013manifolds.\nOur result suggests that the symplectic cone shares the properties of the fibered cone of a\n3\u2013manifold. We propose the following conjecture.\nConjecture 3.2. Let W be a symplectic 4\u2013manifold. Then there exists a (possibly non\u2013\ncompact) polytope C \u2282 H 2 (W ; R) with the following properties:\n(1) The dual polytope in H2 (W ; R) is compact, symmetric, convex and integral.\n(2) There exist open top\u2013dimensional faces F1 , . . . , Fs of C such that the symplectic cone\ncoincides with all non\u2013degenerate elements in the cone on F1 , . . . , Fs .\nReferences\n[BT82] R.
