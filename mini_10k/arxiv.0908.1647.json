Examples can, among many others, be found in [7, 11, 20]. In particular, some\napproaches to the deformation quantization of genuinely dissipative systems have been conducted,\nsee [13,14]. So far, it seems that no successful attempt has been made at a mathematically consistent\nsystematic quantization of open systems originating from coupled systems.\nWe chose the framework of deformation quantization. The central object of deformation quantization [3] is the algebra of observables. States are regarded as a derived concept in the sense of\nnormalized positive linear functionals on the algebra of observables in the classical as well as in the\nquantum case. The star products used to deform the classical algebra of observables in this process\nare meant to be Hermitian star products. The existence of such star products on the smooth functions of Poisson manifolds has been proven by [18]. For the special case of symplectic manifolds the\nexistence has been proven earlier by [12,16,19], see also the textbook [24] for additional references.\nIn the manner of speaking of [6], we get an open system (classical and quantum mechanical)\nby constructing a microscopic model and non-selectively integrating the degrees of freedom of the\nenvironment.\nAs a first step, we give a consistent and general definition of what a classical and quantum\nopen Hamiltonian system in the sense of deformation quantization should be relying on the notion\nof completely positive evolutions in both cases. As main result we prove that every classical open\nHamiltonian system can be deformation quantized preserving complete positivity of the evolution\nmap. A by-product of independent interest is the result that for every Hermitian star product\non a Poisson manifold there is a completely positive map into the undeformed algebra of formal\nseries of smooth functions deforming the identity map. Our general formalism is exemplified for\ntwo coupled harmonic oscillators.\nThis article is organized in the following way: In Section 2 a notion of classical open dynamical\nsystems in general and the notion of a classical open Hamiltonian system used for deformation\nquantization in particular are defined. In Section 3 we will briefly recall the notions of a Hermitian\nstar product and the quantum time evolution with regard to a Hermitian star product. We prove\nin Theorem 3.5 that for every Hermitian star product one has a completely positive map deforming\nthe identity into the formal series of smooth functions with respect to the undeformed product.\nThis turns out to be the main tool to show Theorem 3.13: every classical open Hamiltonian system\ncan be deformation quantized. In Section 4, as an illustration, we give the standard example of\nthe total time evolution of two one-dimensional linearly coupled harmonic oscillators in the setting\nof deformation quantization. Section 5 contains the open time evolutions of a coupled harmonic\noscillator with respect to states on the bath oscillator corresponding to deformed initial values and\nto KMS states.\n\n2\n\nClassical Open Dynamical Systems\n\nThere are many ways to specify the notion of open dynamical systems. A fairly general approach\nis obtained as follows: We start with a subsystem whose pure states are described by a smooth\nmanifold S and a bath which is described analogously by a smooth manifold B. The combined total\nsystem has the Cartesian product S \u00d7 B as space of pure states.\nAn open dynamical system is now a time evolution of (pure) states in S \u00d7 B where we only look\nat the S-part \"ignoring\" the B-part. More precisely, this is obtained as follows:\nOn the total system we specify an ordinary dynamical system, i.e. a vector field X \u2208 \u0393\u221e (T (S \u00d7\nB)) with flow \u03a8t : S \u00d7 B \u2212\u2192 S \u00d7 B. For simplicity, we may assume that the flow \u03a8t is complete,\n2\n\n\fotherwise we have to restrict to certain neighbourhoods in S \u00d7 B and finite times in the usual way.\nWith this assumption, \u03a8t is a smooth one-parameter group of diffeomorphisms of S \u00d7 B with\nd\n\u03a8t = X \u25e6 \u03a8t\ndt\n\nfor all t \u2208\n\nR.\n\n(2.1)\n\nNext we consider the canonical projection maps\npr\n\npr\n\nS\nB\nS \u2190\u2212\nS \u00d7 B \u2212\u2192\nB,\n\n(2.2)\n\nwhich allow to decompose the tangent bundle T (S \u00d7 B) into\n#\nT (S \u00d7 B) = pr#\nS T S \u2295 prB T B,\n\n(2.3)\n\n#\nwhere pr#\nS T S and prB T B denote the pull-backs of the tangent bundles of S and B, respectively.\nClearly, the map prS forgets the degrees of freedom of the bath and thus corresponds precisely\nto the idea that we want to ignore the B-part. However, for the time evolution of S we still have to\nspecify an initial condition for the bath as well. For the moment, we restrict ourselves to pure states\nand allow for mixed states later on. Thus let xB \u2208 B be a point whence we have the embedding\n\n\u03b9x : S \u220b xS 7\u2192 (xS , xB ) \u2208 S \u00d7 B,\n\n(2.4)\n\nB\n\nwhich is clearly a diffeomorphism onto its image such that prS \u25e6 \u03b9x = idS and prB \u25e6 \u03b9x = xB is the\nB\nB\nconstant map.\nDefinition 2.1 (Open time evolution, pure case) For any xB \u2208 B the open time evolution\nx\n\n\u03a6t B : S \u2212\u2192 S of S with respect to the total time evolution \u03a8t of S \u00d7 B and the pure state xB of\nthe bath is given by\nx\n\u03a6t B = prS \u25e6 \u03a8t \u25e6 \u03b9x .\n(2.5)\nB\n\nOf course, we have to justify this definition and examine some consequences as well as properties\nx\nof \u03a6t B . First of all, the map\n\u03a6\n\nxB\n\n:\n\nR \u00d7 S \u220b (t, x ) 7\u2192 \u03a6xt\nS\n\nB\n\n(xS ) \u2208 S\n\n(2.6)\n\nis clearly smooth. However, it does not have the usual properties of an ordinary time evolution:\nx\nFor a fixed time t the map \u03a6t B needs not to be a diffeomorphism, not even for small times. We\nonly have the following \"evolution property\" which easily follows from the one-parameter group\nproperty of \u03a8t :\nProposition 2.2 For the open time evolution we have\nx\n\n\u03a60 B = idS\nfor all xS \u2208 S, xB \u2208 B, and s, t \u2208\nExample 2.3 Let S =\n\non S \u00d7 B.\n\nand\n\nprB (\u03a8t (xS ,xB ))\n\n\u03a6s\n\nR.\n\nx\n\nx\n\nB\n(xS )\n\u25e6 \u03a6t B (xS ) = \u03a6s+t\n\n(2.7)\n\nR = B and consider the time evolution\n\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u03a8t xS , xB = xS cos(\u03bdt) \u2212 xB sin(\u03bdt), xS sin(\u03bdt) + xB cos(\u03bdt)\n3\n\n(2.8)\n\n\fi.) The simplest case is obtained for \u03bd \u2208\nevolution for xB \u2208 B is given by\n\nR being a non-zero constant.\n\nThen the open time\n\nx\n\n\u03a6t B (xS ) = xS cos(\u03bdt) \u2212 xB sin(\u03bdt)\nwhich is a diffeomorphism for small t but the constant map for \u03bdt \u2208\n\n(2.9)\n\u03c0\n2\n\nZ\n\n+\u03c0 .\n\nii.) We can also consider the case where \u03bd is a function on S \u00d7 B depending only on the radius,\ne.g. \u03bd(xS , xB ) = x2S + x2B . Then \u03a8t is still a one-parameter group of diffeomorphisms and the\nflow lines are still concentric circles around (0, 0). However, the points in S \u00d7 B spin faster\nthe further away from (0, 0) they are. Now the open time evolution is\nx\n\n\u03a6t B (xS ) = xS cos((x2S + x2B )t) \u2212 xB sin((x2S + x2B )t).\nE.g. for xB = 0 this gives \u03a60t (xS ) = xS cos(x2S t) which yields\n\u0012r \u0013\n\u03c0\n0\n\u03a6t\n=0\n2t\n\n(2.10)\n\n(2.11)\n\nfor all t > 0. Since also \u03a60t (0) = 0 for all t we see that \u03a60t cannot be a diffeomorphism, even\nfor arbitrarily small time t > 0.\nx\n\nFrom the example we conclude that the open time evolution \u03a6t B in general is not a solution to a\nprobably time-dependent differential equation on S alone, i.e. in general there is no time-dependent\nvector field Xt \u2208 \u0393\u221e (T S) with\nd xB\nx\n\u03a6 = Xt \u25e6 \u03a6t B .\n(2.12)\ndt t\nNevertheless, this situation of a time-dependent vector field is a particular case of an open time\nevolution as the next example shows:\nExample 2.4 Let Xt \u2208 \u0393\u221e (T S) be a smooth time-dependent vector field on S and let X \u2208\n\u0393\u221e (T (S \u00d7 )) be the corresponding time-independent vector field\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u2202\n,\n(2.13)\nX(xS , t) = Xt (xS ),\n\u2202t t\n\nR\n\nR\n\nwhere we use the splitting (2.3) of T (S \u00d7 ) and the canonical constant vector field on the \"bath\"\nB = . For simplicity, we assume that X has a complete flow \u03a8t . Then the open time evolution\nfor initial condition xB = 0 of the bath is\n\u0001\n\u03a60t (xS ) = prS \u03a8t (xS , 0) .\n(2.14)\n\nR\n\nBut this is precisely the time evolution of the time-dependent vector field Xt , i.e. we have\nd 0\n\u03a6 = Xt \u25e6 \u03a60t ,\ndt t\n\n(2.15)\n\nas an easy and well-known computation shows. Thus the ordinary time evolution of a timedependent vector field can be viewed as a particular case of an open time evolution in the sense of\nDefinition 2.1.\n\n4\n\n\fIn view of the yet to be found quantization of open dynamical systems we consider now the\neffect of an open time evolution on the functions C \u221e (S) as these will play the role of the observables\nlater. The following statement is obvious:\nx\n\nProposition 2.5 Let xB \u2208 B. Then (\u03a6t B )\u2217 : C \u221e (S) \u2212\u2192 C \u221e (S) is a \u2217 -homomorphism for every\nt \u2208 and we have\nx\nb \u03b4x ) \u25e6 \u03a8\u2217t \u25e6 pr\u2217S .\n(\u03a6t B )\u2217 = (id \u2297\n(2.16)\n\nR\n\nC \u221e (S)\n\nB\n\nC\n\ndenotes the \u03b4-functional at xB , i.e. the evaluation of a function at the\nHere \u03b4x :\n\u2212\u2192\nB\nb \u03b4x is the induced map\npoint xB . Moreover, id \u2297\nB\n\nb \u03b4x : C \u221e (S) \u2297\nb C \u221e (B) = C \u221e (S \u00d7 B) \u2212\u2192 C \u221e (S),\nid \u2297\n\n(2.17)\n\nB\n\nb denotes the completed projective tensor product. Note that the involved Fr\u00e9chet spaces\nwhere \u2297\nare nuclear anyway.\nx\nThough Proposition 2.5 is a trivial reformulation of the definition of \u03a6t B it gives a new point of\nview: to this end, recall that a linear functional \u03c90 : C \u221e (M ) \u2212\u2192 is called positive if \u03c90 (f f ) \u2265 0\nfor all functions f \u2208 C \u221e (M ). Similarly, we can define a positive functional on matrix-valued\nfunctions Mn (C \u221e (M )). Having the notion of positive linear functionals we can define positive\nalgebra elements by setting that f \u2208 C \u221e (M ) is positive if \u03c90 (f ) \u2265 0 for all positive linear functionals\n\u03c90 . Then it is a true but slightly non-trivial fact that f is positive iff f (p) \u2265 0 for all points p \u2208 M .\nThe same holds for matrix-valued functions: a function F \u2208 Mn (C \u221e (M )) is positive iff F (p) is\na positive semi-definite matrix for all p \u2208 M . Note that in our approach, this is not a definition\nbut a consequence of the more algebraic definition. Finally, a linear map \u03c6 : C \u221e (M ) \u2212\u2192 C \u221e (N )\nis called positive if it maps positive functions to positive functions. More important is the notion\nof a completely positive map: \u03c6 is called completely positive if all the canonical extensions \u03c6 :\nMn (C \u221e (M )) \u2212\u2192 Mn (C \u221e (N )) are positive maps for n \u2208 . Clearly, this is the standard definition\nvalid for every \u2217 -algebra over the complex numbers , see e.g. [22] for a detailed exposition and [8,\nApp. B] for a discussion of the case of smooth functions.\nNow we come back to our particular situation: while \u03a6\u2217t and pr\u2217S are canonically given \u2217 homomorphisms of the \u2217 -algebras of smooth functions and hence completely positive maps, the\nb \u03b4x can also be interpreted as a positive (and in fact completely positive) map which\nmap id \u2297\nB\ncoincides with a \u2217 -homomorphism \u03b9\u2217x \"by accident\". In particular, we can replace the positive\nB\nfunctional \u03b4x by any, not necessarily pure state \u03c90 of C \u221e (B), that is, a positive linear normalized\nB\nfunctional \u03c90 : C \u221e (B) \u2212\u2192 .

Therefore, any state \u03c90 : C \u221e (B) \u2212\u2192\nis automatically continuous with respect to the\nsmooth topology.

With this definition we shifted the focus to the observable algebra rather than the\nunderlying geometry.\nProposition 2.8 For any state \u03c90 of the bath, the open time evolution (\u03a6\u03c9t 0 )\u2217 : C \u221e (S) \u2212\u2192 C \u221e (S)\nis a completely positive map.\nb \u03c90 is a completely\nProof: Since \u03a8\u2217t and pr\u2217S are \u2217 -homomorphisms we only have to show that id \u2297\n\u221e\n\u221e\n\u221e\npositive map from C (S \u00d7 B) to C (S). Thus let F \u2208 Mn (C (S \u00d7 B)) be given and let xS \u2208 S.\nThen we have the embedding \u03b9x : B \u2212\u2192 S \u00d7 B whence\nS\n\nb \u03c90 ) = \u03b4x \u2297\nb \u03c90 = \u03c90 \u25e6 (\u03b4x \u2297\nb id) = \u03c90 \u25e6 \u03b9\u2217 .\n\u03b4x \u25e6 (id \u2297\nx\nS\n\nS\n\nS\n\nS\n\n(2.19)\n\nSince \u03b9\u2217x is a \u2217 -homomorphism, the composition \u03c90 \u25e6 \u03b9\u2217x is still a positive functional and hence\nS\nS\na completely positive map. Thus, applied to F \u2217 F , we get a positive semi-definite matrix \u03c90 \u25e6\nb \u03c90 )(F \u2217 F ).

However,\nin general, (\u03a6\u03c9t 0 )\u2217 is just a completely positive map without any further nice algebraic features.\nWhile up to now we have considered arbitrary dynamical systems, we shall pass to more specific\nones: we assume to have a Hamiltonian dynamics on the total space of the system and the bath.\nIn more detail, we choose the rather general setting of Poisson geometry to formulate Hamiltonian\ndynamics. This framework contains in particular any symplectic phase space such as coadjoint\norbits, cotangent bundles or K\u00e4hler manifolds. However, also the dual of a Lie algebra is a (linear)\nPoisson manifold which is important when dealing with symmetries, see e.g. [24, Chap. 3 & Chap. 4]\nfor an introduction.\nThus, let the state space of the system (S, \u03c0S ) and the one of the bath (B, \u03c0B ) be in addition\nPoisson manifolds with Poisson structures \u03c0S and \u03c0B . On the total system S \u00d7 B we choose the\nproduct Poisson structure\n(2.20)\n\u03c0 = pr\u266fS \u03c0S + pr\u266fB \u03c0B .\nThis means that for functions fS , gS \u2208 C \u221e (S) and fB , gB \u2208 C \u221e (B) the factorizing functions f =\nfS \u2297 fB and g = gS \u2297 gB have the Poisson bracket\n{f, g} = {fS , gS }S \u2297 fB gB + fS gS \u2297 {fB , gB }B .\n\n(2.21)\n\nThe dynamics of the total system is given by the Hamiltonian vector field XH \u2208 \u0393\u221e (T (S \u00d7 B))\nwith respect to the total Hamiltonian H \u2208 C \u221e (S \u00d7 B). Recall that the Hamiltonian vector field\nis defined by XH = {*, H}. In typical situations, the total Hamiltonian contains three parts: we\nhave the Hamiltonian HS \u2208 C \u221e (S) of the system alone, the Hamiltonian HB \u2208 C \u221e (B) of the bath\nalone, and an interaction Hamiltonian HI \u2208 C \u221e (S \u00d7 B) such that the total Hamiltonian is\nH = pr\u2217S HS + pr\u2217B HB + HI .\n6\n\n(2.22)\n\n\fThen the total Hamiltonian time evolution is the flow \u03a6t : S \u00d7 B \u2212\u2192 S \u00d7 B of XH which we assume\nto be complete for simplicity and analogously to Definition 2.6 the open Hamiltonian time evolution\nwith respect to a given state of the bath is defined as follows:\nDefinition 2.11 (Classical open Hamiltonian time evolution) The classical open Hamiltonian time evolution of the system S with respect to a total Hamiltonian time evolution \u03a6t of S \u00d7 B\nand a given state \u03c90 of the bath is given as the open time evolution\n(\u03a6\u03c9t 0 )\u2217 : C \u221e (S) \u2212\u2192 C \u221e (S)\n\n(2.23)\n\naccording to Definition 2.6.\nRemark 2.12 Again, unless we have special circumstances, the open Hamiltonian time evolution\nis just a completely positive map without any further algebraic features. In particular, there is no\nreason that (\u03a6\u03c9t 0 )\u2217 should preserve Poisson brackets, even for \u03c90 = \u03b4x being a pure state.\nB\n\n3\n\nDeformation Quantization of Open Hamiltonian Systems\n\nIn this section we will establish the deformation quantized version of the open Hamiltonian time\nevolution. To this end, we recall that a formal star product on a Poisson manifold (M, \u03c0) is an\nassociative [[~]]-bilinear multiplication\n\nC\n\nf \u22c6g =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\n~r Cr (f, g)\n\n(3.1)\n\nr=0\n\nfor f, g \u2208 C \u221e (M )[[~]] such that C0 (f, g) = f g is the undeformed commutative product, C1 (f, g) \u2212\nC1 (g, f ) = i{f, g} with the Poisson bracket {*, *}, 1 \u22c6 f = f = f \u22c6 1 for the constant function 1,\nand all Cr are bidifferential operators [3], see also [24] for a pedagogical introduction. The reason\nthat we chose formal star products where a priori no convergence in ~ is controlled, is that for this\nsituation we have the powerful existence and classification theorems of deformation quantization\nat hand. Physically, of course, one would like to have convergence or at least some asymptotic\nstatements. In many examples this is possible but we shall not enter this rather technical issue\nhere any further.\nIn the sequel, the case where the star product \u22c6 is Hermitian will be important, i.e.\nf \u22c6g =g\u22c6f\n\n(3.2)\n\nfor all f, g \u2208 C \u221e (M )[[~]] where ~ = ~ is treated as a real quantity. This \u2217 -involution will be\nnecessary to have the honest interpretation of the algebra (C \u221e (M )[[~]], \u22c6) as observable algebra of\nthe quantum system corresponding to the classical system.\nHaving the observable algebra, it is natural to define the states in the same way as classically:\nwe use positive linear functionals. Now however, we have to specify first what a positive formal\nseriesPshould be. Here we can rely on the following definition. A non-zero real formal power series\nr\na = \u221e\n[[~]] is called positive if its lowest non-zero component is positive, ar0 > 0.\nr=r0 ~ ar \u2208\nIn this case we write a \u2265 0. This is a good definition for many reasons: if we view formal\nseries as arising from asymptotic expansions then this is what remains from a positive function.\nMore algebraically, [[~]] becomes an ordered ring by this definition, hence we can rely on the\nrich and well-developed theory of \u2217 -algebras over ordered rings, see e.g. [9, 23] for an overview\nand [24, Chap. 7] for an introduction and further references.\n\nR\n\nR\n\n7\n\n\fFor star product algebras we can proceed analogously to the classical case and define a\nlinear functional \u03c9 : C \u221e (M )[[~]] \u2212\u2192 [[~]] to be positive if\n\nC\n\n\u03c9(f \u22c6 f ) \u2265 0\n\nC[[~]](3.3)\n\nfor all f \u2208 C \u221e (M )[[~]]. It can be shown that it suffices to check (3.3) for f \u2208 C \u221e (M ) without\nhigher orders of ~. Analogously, we define positive linear functionals for matrix-valued functions\nF \u2208 Mn (C \u221e (M )[[~]]) where the star product is extended to matrices in the usual way. Having\npositive functionals we define f \u2208 C \u221e (M )[[~]] or F \u2208 Mn (C \u221e (M )[[~]]) to be a positive algebra\nelement if\n\u03c9(f ) \u2265 0 and \u03a9(F ) \u2265 0\n(3.4)\n\nC\n\nfor all positive functionals \u03c9 and \u03a9, respectively. Finally, a [[~]]-linear map \u03c6 : C \u221e (M )[[~]] \u2212\u2192\nC \u221e (N )[[~]] between two star product algebras on possibly different underlying manifolds is called\npositive if \u03c6 maps positive elements to positive elements. Equivalently, \u03c6 is called positive if\n\u03c9 \u25e6 \u03c6 is a positive functional on C \u221e (M )[[~]] for all positive functionals \u03c9 on C \u221e (N )[[~]]. The\nmap \u03c6 is called completely positive if this is also true for arbitrary matrix-valued functions, i.e. if\n\u03c6(n) : Mn (C \u221e (M )[[~]]) \u2212\u2192 Mn (C \u221e (N )[[~]]) is positive for all n \u2208 . Note that even though these\ndefinitions are in complete analogy to the classical situation, it is nevertheless crucial to have a\ngood notion of positive formal power series in [[~]].\n\nN\n\nR\n\nRemark 3.1 It is clear that the above concepts generalize immediately to \u2217 -algebras A over a ring\nC = R(i) where R is an ordered ring and i is a square root of \u22121. Even though many of the following\nconsiderations generalize to this algebraic framework as well, we shall focus on the more particular\nsituation of star products.\nRemark 3.2 In the following, completely positive maps will play a crucial role. It is easy to\nsee that positive functionals are in fact completely positive maps. Also \u2217 -homomorphisms are\ncompletely positive. Moreover, the composition of completely positive maps as well as convex\ncombinations of completely positive maps are again completely positive. Finally, less evident but\nnevertheless true is the fact that the algebraic tensor product of completely positive maps is again\ncompletely positive. In general, this last statement is wrong for positive maps.\nTo describe the positive\nnecessarily of the form\n\u03c9=\n\nC[[~]]-linear functionals of (C \u221e(M )[[~]], \u22c6) one first notes that \u03c9 is\n\n\u221e\nX\n\n~r \u03c9r\n\nwith linear maps\n\nr=0\n\n\u03c9r : C \u221e (M ) \u2212\u2192\n\nC.\n\n(3.5)\n\nThen the positivity \u03c9(f \u22c6 f ) \u2265 0 in the sense of formal power series immediately implies that\n\u03c90 (f f ) \u2265 0 classically, i.e. \u03c90 is a positive -linear functional. This raises the question whether\nevery classical state \u03c90 can be \"quantized\" into a state \u03c9 with respect to the star product. In other\nwords, we ask whether every classical state is the classical limit of some quantum state. Physically,\nthis is absolutely necessary as quantum theory is believed to be the more fundamental description\nof nature. Fortunately, we can rely on the following theorem [10], even for the case of matrices.\nBut first we give a definition which shall simplify the further considerations.\n\nC\n\nC\n\nP\nr\n\u221e\nDefinition 3.3 (Square preserving map) A [[~]]-linear map S = id + \u221e\nr=1 ~ Sr : C (M )[[~]]\n\u2212\u2192 C \u221e (M )[[~]] with differential operators Sr , S(1) = 1, and S(f ) = S(f ) is called preserving\n8\n\n\fsquares with respect to \u22c6, if there are formal series of differential operators Dr,I : C \u221e (M )[[~]] \u2212\u2192\nC \u221e (M )[[~]] for r \u2208 0 and I running over a finite range (possibly depending on r) such that\n\nN\n\nS(f \u22c6 g) =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\n~r\n\nr=0\n\nX\n\nDr,I (f )Dr,I (g)\n\n(3.6)\n\nI\n\nfor all f, g \u2208 C \u221e (M )[[~]].\nRemark 3.4 It is fairly simple to see that a map preserving squares according to Definition 3.3\nis in fact a completely positive map from the quantized algebra (C \u221e (M )[[~]], \u22c6) to the classical\nalgebra (C \u221e (M )[[~]], *) with the undeformed product.\nTheorem 3.5 Given a Hermitian star product \u22c6, there exists a globally defined map S preserving\nsquares with respect to \u22c6.\nProof: By [10] we know that for a Hermitian star product \u22c6 on an open subset U \u2286\nexists a map preserving squares with respect to \u22c6, denoted by\nS(f \u22c6 g) =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\n~r\n\nr=0\n\nX\n\nDr,I (f )Dr,I (g).\n\nRn there\n(\u2217)\n\nI\n\nFor the Poisson manifold M with star product \u22c6 we choose a finite atlas. Note that we can always\nfind an atlas consisting of dim(M ) + 1 not necessarily connected charts. Denote the domains of\nthe charts by U\u03b1 \u2286 M . Next we choose a P\ncorresponding subordinate finite quadratic partition of\nunity \u03c7\u03b1 \u2208 C \u221e (M ), i.e. supp \u03c7\u03b1 \u2286 U\u03b1 and \u03b1 \u03c7\u03b1 \u03c7\u03b1 = 1. Now let S\u03b1 be the locally available maps\npreserving squares with respect to \u22c6|U\u03b1 with corresponding locally defined differential operators\nDr,I,\u03b1 . Then we set\n\u0011\n\u0010\nX\n\u03c7\u03b1 \u03c7\u03b1 S\u03b1 f U\u03b1 .\nS(f ) =\n\u03b1\n\nClearly, this gives a globally well-defined formal series of differential operators with S(f ) = S(f )\nand S(1) = 1. Moreover, since the star product is bidifferential, we have (f \u22c6 g)|U \u03b1 = f |U\u03b1 \u22c6 g|U\u03b1\nand hence we can apply (\u2217) to obtain\nS(f \u22c6 g) =\n\n\u221e\nX\nr=0\n\n~r\n\nX\n\n\u03c7\u03b1 Dr,I,\u03b1(f )\u03c7\u03b1 Dr,I,\u03b1(g).\n\nI,\u03b1\n\n\u0004\nRemark 3.6 Recently, a C \u2217 -algebraic version of this theorem was obtained for particular strict\ndeformation quantizations in [17].\nThe proof of Theorem 3.5 immediately leads to the following consequence.\nCorollary 3.7 For every Hermitian star product \u22c6 on a Poisson manifold there exists an equivalent\nstar product \u22c6\u2032 with the property that every classically positive linear functional \u03c90 is also positive\nwith respect to \u22c6\u2032 .\nProof: This is now easy, as we take a map S preserving squares with respect to \u22c6. Then the star\nproduct f \u22c6\u2032 g = S(S\u22121 (f ) \u22c6 S\u22121 (g)) is easily shown to do the job.\n\u0004\n\n9\n\n\fRemark 3.8 Rephrasing the result from [10] in terms of Theorem 3.5 says that every classical\npositive linear functional \u03c90 can be deformed into a positive linear functional with respect to a\nHermitian star product. Indeed, \u03c90 \u25e6 S will be such a deformation, even universal for all \u03c90 once\nS is specified. In general, correction terms in higher orders of ~ are necessary to obtain positivity.\nMoreover, they are by far not unique and neither is the map S. This is of course to be expected, both\nfrom a physical and mathematical point of view. Finally, note that each term \u03c90 \u25e6 Sr is continuous\nin the smooth topology, since the classical functional \u03c90 is continuous and the differential operators\nSr are as well.\nAfter this discussion of states we also need a notion of time evolution for star product algebras.\nHere we can rely on the following facts. For a given Hamiltonian H \u2208 C \u221e (M )[[~]], where we might\neven allow for some ~-dependent correction terms, we consider the Heisenberg equation\ni\nd\nf (t) = [H, f (t)]\u22c6\ndt\n~\n\n(3.7)\n\nfor f (t) \u2208 C \u221e (M )[[~]]. Note that the right-hand side is a well-defined formal power series since\nthe commutator vanishes in zeroth order. For simplicity, we assume that the Hamiltonian vector\nfield corresponding to the zeroth order H0 of H has a complete flow \u03a6t . In this case, one can show\nthat (3.7) has a solution for all times with the following properties: There exists a formal series of\nP\nr (r) on M such that\ntime-dependent differential operators Tt = id + \u221e\nr=1 ~ Tt\nAt = \u03a6\u2217t \u25e6 Tt : C \u221e (M )[[~]] \u2212\u2192 C \u221e (M )[[~]]\n\n(3.8)\n\nis a one-parameter group of automorphisms of \u22c6 with f (t) = At f being the unique solution of (3.7)\nwith initial condition f (0) = f . Moreover, At commutes with the commutator [H, *]\u22c6 and we have\nconservation of energy At H = H as usual. Finally, if \u22c6 is a Hermitian star product and H = H a\nreal Hamiltonian then At is even a \u2217 -automorphism for each t. For details on this quantized version\nof the classical time evolution we refer to [24, Sect. 6.3.4] and references therein.\nAfter this preparatory discussion we come back to our original situation of a coupled total\nsystem S \u00d7 B. As we already have a nice separation of the total Poisson structure into the Poisson\nstructure of the system and the one of the bath, we shall require the same feature also for the\nquantization. Thus, we assume to have Hermitian star products \u22c6S on S and \u22c6B on B, respectively.\nb \u22c6B on S \u00d7 B in such a way that\nThen this immediately induces a Hermitian star product \u22c6 = \u22c6S \u2297\npr\u2217\n\npr\u2217\n\nS\nB\n(C \u221e (S)[[~]], \u22c6S ) \u2212\u2192\n(C \u221e (S \u00d7 B)[[~]], \u22c6) \u2190\u2212\n(C \u221e (B)[[~]], \u22c6B )\n\n(3.9)\n\nare both \u2217 -homomorphisms of the involved star products. On factorizing functions we have\nf \u22c6 g = (fS \u22c6S gS ) \u2297 (fB \u22c6B gB ),\n\n(3.10)\n\nwhere f = fS \u2297 fB and g = gS \u2297 gB for fS , gS \u2208 C \u221e (S)[[~]] and fB , gB \u2208 C \u221e (B)[[~]]. Clearly, (2.21)\nbecomes the first order limit of (3.10) in the commutators.\nRemark 3.9 It will be crucial for our approach that the algebraic structure of the observables\nis a priori given and will stay untouched. The physical interpretation is, that whatever the time\nevolution will be, the way how certain quantities, the observables, are measured is independent\nof any sort of dynamics but a purely kinematical property of the physical system. Thus our star\nproducts \u22c6, \u22c6S , and \u22c6B will be given once and for all and not changed by the open time evolution.\nNote that this is not the only possibility to deal with open systems: in [14] the star product itself\nwas modified in order to describe a damped harmonic oscillator.\n10\n\n\fIt is now rather obvious what a good definition of a quantized open Hamiltonian time evolution\nin deformation quantization should be:\nDefinition 3.10 (Quantized open Hamiltonian time evolution) Let H \u2208 C \u221e (S \u00d7 B)[[~]] be\na Hamiltonian with complete time evolution At and let \u03c9 : C \u221e (B)[[~]] \u2212\u2192 [[~]] be a positive\n[[~]]-linear functional.

Thus we\nr\nhave to require that \u03c9 = \u221e\nr=0 ~ \u03c9r is continuous in each order of ~, i.e. each \u03c9r is a continuous\nlinear functional with respect to the smooth topology. In view of Theorem 3.5 and Remark 3.8 this\nseems to be a very reasonable assumption.\nRemark 3.12 Putting Theorem 3.5, Remark 3.8, the existence of Hermitian star products in [18],\nand the existence of the quantum time evolution of Equation (3.8) together it is easy to see that\nany classical open Hamiltonian time evolution can be quantized into a quantized open Hamiltonian\ntime evolution. Conversely, the classical limit of any quantized open Hamiltonian time evolution\nis a classical open Hamiltonian time evolution for the classical limit of the Hamiltonian and with\nrespect to the classical limit of the quantum state by construction as A\u03c9t = (\u03a6\u03c9t 0 )\u2217 + O(~).\nIn view of Definition 3.10 it is tempting to believe that the quantized open Hamiltonian time\nevolution A\u03c9t is completely positive. Indeed, if we would have used the algebraic tensor product in\nb in every order of ~, then this would be a trivial statement:\n(3.11) instead of the completed one \u2297\nthe algebraic tensor product of the completely positive maps id and \u03c9 is again completely positive,\nand so is the composition with the completely positive \u2217 -homomorphisms At and pr\u2217S . However,\nthe crucial point is that the Fr\u00e9chet topology of the smooth functions and the ~-adic topology\noriginating from the ring ordering are not very well compatible. In fact, it is not clear whether\nthe completed tensor product is completely positive or not. Note that this is rather different from\nthe C \u2217 -algebraic case where the completed projective tensor product of completely positive maps is\nalways completely positive. From that point of view, the following principal result on the quantized\nopen Hamiltonian time evolution is non-trivial:\nTheorem 3.13 Let \u03c9 be a positive\n\nC[[~]]-linear functional on (C \u221e(B)[[~]], \u22c6\n\nB\n\n) of the form\n\n\u03c9 = \u03c90 \u25e6 S\n\n(3.12)\n\nwith S preserving squares with respect to \u22c6B . Then any quantized open Hamiltonian time evolution\nwith respect to \u03c9 is completely positive.\nb \u03c9 is completely\nProof: As pr\u2217S and At are \u2217 -homomorphisms, the only thing left to show is that id \u2297\n\u221e\npositive. We extend S to matrices as usual. For F \u2208 Mn (C (S \u00d7 B)[[~]]) we have\n\u0001 X rX \u2217\nb S)(F \u2217 \u22c6 F ) =\n\u03b9x (Dr,I (F ))\u2217 \u22c6S \u03b9\u2217x (Dr,I (F )) ,\n~\n\u03b9\u2217x (id \u2297\nB\n\nr=0\n\nI\n\nB\n\nB\n\nsince the restriction to xB \u2208 B commutes with the pointwise products in (3.6). Now let \u03bc :\nC \u221e (S)[[~]] \u2212\u2192 [[~]] be a positive [[~]]-linear functional with respect to \u22c6S . Then for every xB\n\u0011\n\u0001 X rX \u0010 \u2217\nb S)(F \u2217 \u22c6 F ) =\n\u03bc \u03b9x (Dr,I (F ))\u2217 \u22c6S \u03b9\u2217x (Dr,I (F )) \u2208 Mn ( )[[~]]\n~\n\u03b9\u2217x (\u03bc \u2297\n\nC\n\nB\n\nC\n\nr=0\n\nI\n\nB\n\n11\n\nB\n\nC\n\n\fb S)(F \u2217 \u22c6 F ) \u2265 0. But\nis positive. So if \u03c90 is classically positive, we conclude that \u03c90 \u25e6 (\u03bc \u2297\nb S) = \u03bc \u25e6 (id \u2297\nb (\u03c90 \u25e6 S)) = \u03bc \u25e6 (id \u2297\nb \u03c9). Thus, \u03bc \u25e6 (id \u2297\nb \u03c9)(F \u2217 \u22c6 F ) is positive for all positive\n\u03c90 \u25e6 (\u03bc \u2297\n\u2217\nb \u03c9)(F \u22c6 F ) is a positive algebra element for all matrices F\nfunctionals \u03bc. This implies that (id \u2297\nb\nand hence id \u2297 \u03c9 is a completely positive map as claimed.\n\u0004\n\nRemark 3.14 The assertion of Theorem 3.13 is actually true for more quantum states than the\nones of type (3.12): we will see examples later on in Proposition 5.4. We also note that a possible\nfailure of the complete positivity of A\u03c9t should be seen as an artifact of the rather fine (and not too\nphysical) ~-adic topology of formal power series in ~. One would expect reasonable behaviour as\nsoon as one enters a convergent regime like strict deformation quantization.\nRemark 3.15 In general, the quantized open Hamiltonian time evolution A\u03c9t is no \u2217 -automorphism\nof (C \u221e (S)[[~]], \u22c6S ). Furthermore, a close look at Equation (3.11) shows that usually A\u03c9s \u25e6A\u03c9t 6= A\u03c9s+t\nas expected from a microscopic system.\nRemark 3.16 Using the notions of super manifolds and star products on super symplectic manifolds according to [4, 15] one can easily extend our formalism to this framework. This way, one can\nincorporate spin systems.\n\n4\n\nLinearly Coupled Harmonic Oscillators I: Generalities\n\nAs an example, consider the well-known linear coupling of two one-dimensional harmonic oscillators.\nWe shall describe a one-dimensional harmonic oscillator as a Hamiltonian system (M, \u03c0, H), given\n2\n1 2\n2\n+ . The Poisson\np + m\u03bd\nby M = T \u2217 q \u2243 2q,p , with Hamiltonian H(q, p) = 2m\n2 q , where m, \u03bd \u2208\nbracket is then determined by\n\nR\n\nR\n\nR\n\n{q, p} = 1,\n\n{q, q} = 0 = {p, p} .\n\nNow let us take S = M = B. The Hamiltonian system (S \u00d7 B, \u03c0, H) describing the linearly coupled\nidentical harmonic oscillators is then given by the smooth manifold S \u00d7 B \u2243 2q ,p \u00d7 2q ,p , with\nS S\nB B\nthe corresponding Poisson bracket as given by Equation (2.21). In the following, we shall use the\nsame symbols qS , pS , qB , pB for the coordinate functions on S, B, and S \u00d7 B, respectively, in order\nto simplify our notation. In the same spirit, we simply write H = HS + HB + HI for the total\nHamiltonian without the explicit use of pr\u2217S and pr\u2217B . For the linearly coupled harmonic oscillators\nthe interaction term is given by HI = \u03ba2 (qS \u2212 qB )2 , with \u03ba \u2208 + being the coupling constant.\nUsing the new and still global coordinate functions\n\nR\n\nR\n\nR\n\n1\nq1 = \u221a (qS + qB ),\n2\n\n1\np1 = \u221a (pS + pB ),\n2\n\n1\nq2 = \u221a (qS \u2212 qB ),\n2\n\n1\np2 = \u221a (pS \u2212 pB ),\n2\n\nwe can bring the total Hamiltonian to normal form and find the well-known expression\nH=\n\n\u0001 m\u03bd 2 2 m\u03bd\u03ba2 2\n1\nq +\nq\np21 + p22 +\n2m\n2 1\n2 2\n\nwith\n\n\u03bd\u03ba2 = \u03bd 2 +\n\n2\u03ba\n.\nm\n\n(4.1)\n\nThe classical time evolution \u03a6t is known to be a linear map for all t which we can express in matrix\nform as\n\uf8eb\n\ncos(\u03bdt) + cos(\u03bd\u03ba t)\n1\uf8ec\n\u2212m(\u03bd\nsin(\u03bdt) + \u03bd\u03ba sin(\u03bd\u03ba t))\n\uf8ec\n\u03a6t = \uf8ec\n2\uf8ed\ncos(\u03bdt) \u2212 cos(\u03bd\u03ba t)\n\u2212m(\u03bd sin(\u03bdt) \u2212 \u03bd\u03ba sin(\u03bd\u03ba t))\n\nsin(\u03bdt)\nm\u03bd\n\n\u03ba t)\n+ sin(\u03bd\nm\u03bd\u03ba\ncos(\u03bdt) + cos(\u03bd\u03ba t)\nsin(\u03bd\u03ba t)\nsin(\u03bdt)\nm\u03bd \u2212 m\u03bd\u03ba\ncos(\u03bdt) \u2212 cos(\u03bd\u03ba t)\n\n12\n\ncos(\u03bdt) \u2212 cos(\u03bd\u03ba t)\n\u2212m(\u03bd sin(\u03bdt) \u2212 \u03bd\u03ba sin(\u03bd\u03ba t))\ncos(\u03bdt) + cos(\u03bd\u03ba t)\n\u2212m(\u03bd sin(\u03bdt) + \u03bd\u03ba sin(\u03bd\u03ba t))\n\n\uf8f6\n\u03ba t)\n\u2212 sin(\u03bd\nm\u03bd\u03ba\n\uf8f7\ncos(\u03bdt) \u2212 cos(\u03bd\u03ba t)\uf8f7\nsin(\u03bd\u03ba t) \uf8f7\nsin(\u03bdt)\n\uf8f8\nm\u03bd + m\u03bd\u03ba\ncos(\u03bdt) + cos(\u03bd\u03ba t)\nsin(\u03bdt)\nm\u03bd\n\n\fwith respect to the global linear coordinates qS , pS , qB , pB . Thus, the open time evolution \u03a6\u03c9t 0 of\nthe open subsystem with regard to the state \u03c90 of the bath takes the form\n!\u0012 \u0013\n\u0012 \u0013\nsin(\u03bdt)\nsin(\u03bd\u03ba t)\n1\nq\nqS\ncos(\u03bdt)\n+\ncos(\u03bd\nt)\n+\n\u03ba\nm\u03bd\nm\u03bd\u03ba\n(\u03a6\u03c9t 0 )\u2217 S =\npS\npS\n2 \u2212m(\u03bd sin(\u03bdt) + \u03bd\u03ba sin(\u03bd\u03ba t)) cos(\u03bdt) + cos(\u03bd\u03ba t)\n\u0010\n\u0011\n!\n(4.2)\nsin(\u03bd\u03ba t)\n1\n\u03c90 (qB ) (cos(\u03bdt) \u2212 cos(\u03bd\u03ba t)) + \u03c90 (pB ) sin(\u03bdt)\n\u2212\nm\u03bd\nm\u03bd\u03ba\n.\n+\n2 \u2212\u03c90 (qB )m (\u03bd sin(\u03bdt) \u2212 \u03bd\u03ba sin(\u03bd\u03ba t)) + \u03c90 (pB ) (cos(\u03bdt) \u2212 cos(\u03bd\u03ba t))\nAnalogously to the classical case we shall use the normal coordinates in order to simplify the\ncomputation of the quantum time evolution of the total system. Moreover, it will be advantageous\nto combine the real q1 , p1 , q2 , and p2 into complex coordinates which will play the role of annihilation\nand creation \"operators\" later on. We set\n\u221a\n1\n1\npk ,\n(zk + z k ),\nzk = m\u03bdk qk + i \u221am\u03bd\nqk = 2\u221am\u03bd\nk\nk\n\u221a\n\u221a\n(4.3)\nand\nhence\n1\nm\u03bd\nk\n\u221a\nz k = m\u03bdk qk \u2212 i m\u03bdk pk\npk = 2i (zk \u2212 z k )\nfor k = 1, 2 and \u03bd1 = \u03bd, \u03bd2 = \u03bd\u03ba . With respect to these global coordinate functions on M the\ntotal Hamiltonian can be written as H = \u03bd2 z1 z 1 + \u03bd2\u03ba z2 z 2 . For the Poisson brackets one obtains\n{zk , zl } = 0 = {z k , z l } and {zk , z l } = 2i \u03b4kl for all k, l = 1, 2. The Hamiltonian for the system will\ntake a slightly more complicated form, namely\n\u221a\n\u03bd\u03bd\u03ba\n\u03bd2\n\u03bd2\n\u03bd\n2 \u03bd\u03ba\n2\n(z2 +z 2 ) \u2212 (z2 \u2212z2 ) + \u221a\n(z1 +z 1 )(z2 +z 2 )\u2212\n(z1 \u2212z 1 )(z2 \u2212z 2 ). (4.4)\nHS = z 1 z1 +\n4\n16\u03bd\u03ba\n16\n8 \u03bd\u03bd\u03ba\n8\nOn the other hand, we will also need \"factorizing\" complex coordinates with respect to the\noriginal Darboux coordinates on the system S and the bath B. Hence we set\n\u221a\n\u221a\n1\n1\npS ,\npB ,\nzB = m\u03bdqB + i \u221am\u03bd\nzS = m\u03bdqS + i \u221am\u03bd\n\u221a\n\u221a\nand\n(4.5)\n1\n1\n\u221a\n\u221a\nz S = m\u03bdqS \u2212 i m\u03bd pS\nz B = m\u03bdqB \u2212 i m\u03bd pB .\nIn these coordinates, the Hamiltonians of the system and the bath are given by HS = \u03bd2 zS z S and\n\u03ba\nHB = \u03bd2 zB z B . The interaction term now reads HI = 8m\u03bd\n(zS + z S \u2212 zB \u2212 z B )2 . Again, for the\nPoisson brackets one finds {zk , zl } = 0 = {z k , z l } and {zk , z l } = 2i \u03b4kl for all k, l = S, B.\nAfter these preparations, we can specify the star product on the total algebra of observables.\nWe take the Weyl-Moyal star product on the total system S \u00d7 B defined by\nf \u22c6Weyl g\n\u0013 \u0012 \u0013\n\u221e X\nr \u0012\nX\ni r\u2212l i l\n~r\n=\n\u2212\n2\n2 l!(r \u2212 l)!\nr=0\nl=0\n\n2\nX\n\ni1 ,...,ir =1\n\n\u2202r f\n\u2202rg\n,\n\u2202qi1 * * * \u2202qil \u2202pil+1 * * * \u2202pir \u2202pi1 * * * \u2202pil \u2202qil+1 * * * \u2202qir\n(4.6)\n\nfor f, g \u2208 C \u221e (S \u00d7 B)[[~]], see e.g. [3] and [24, Chap. 5].\n\nR\n\nRemark 4.1 The Weyl-Moyal star product on a flat symplectic phase space 2n is uniquely\ndetermined by the requirement of invariance under the affine symplectic group. Under the usual\nquantization map into differential operators it corresponds to the total symmetrization, see e.g. [24,\nb \u22c6Weyl\nChap. 5] for a detailed discussion. We also note that \u22c6Weyl = \u22c6Weyl\n\u2297\nas required by our general\nS\nB\nframework.\n13\n\n\fWhile the Weyl-Moyal star product is the most natural one with respect to phase space symmetries, it has certain technical disadvantages: when dealing with harmonic oscillators, for technical\nreasons it will be more convenient to employ a Wick star product. Such a Wick star product is no\nlonger unique, but depends on the choice of a compatible linear complex structure on the phase\nspace which is nothing but the choice of a harmonic oscillator. Therefore, we will have different\nWick star products adapted to the various harmonic oscillators on hand: either with or without\nthe coupling. In detail, one passes from the Weyl-Moyal star product to the Wick star product by\nmeans of an equivalence transformation explicitly given by\nS = exp (~\u2206)\n\nwith\n\n\u2206=\n\n2\nX\nk=1\n\n\u22022\n.\n\u2202zk \u2202z k\n\n(4.7)\n\nThen the Wick star product \u22c6Wick is defined by f \u22c6Wick g = S(S \u22121 (f ) \u22c6Weyl S \u22121 (g)). Explicitly, \u22c6Wick\nis given by\n2\n\u221e\nX\n\u2202rf\n\u2202rg\n(2~)r X\n(4.8)\nf \u22c6Wick g =\nr!\n\u2202zi1 * * * \u2202zir \u2202z i1 * * * \u2202z ir\nr=0\ni1 ,...,ir =1\n\nR\n\nfor f, g \u2208 C \u221e ( 4 )[[~]]. Alternatively, we ignore the coupling term and use the complex coordinates\nzS , z S for the system and zB , z B for the bath. This gives the two equivalence transformations\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u22022\n\u22022\nSS = exp ~\nand SB = exp ~\n,\n(4.9)\n\u2202zS \u2202z S\n\u2202zB \u2202z B\n\nacting on functions on S and B, respectively. Analogously to (4.8) we get Wick star products \u22c6Wick\nS\nand \u22c6Wick\nfor the system and the bath, respectively. Since we ignored the coupling terms in the\nB\ndefinition of the latter two Wick star products, we have\nb SB\nS 6= SS \u2297\n\nb \u22c6Wick\nand \u22c6Wick 6= \u22c6Wick\n\u2297\n.\nS\nB\n\n(4.10)\n\nThe total time evolution with respect to \u22c6 and H can actually be calculated in a much easier way\nthan by solving the corresponding evolution equation (3.7): we first compute the time evolution\nwith respect to the Wick star product \u22c6Wick , which turns out to be simple, and then transform the\ntime evolved observables back using S.\nThe total time evolution AWick\nwith respect to the Wick star product is determined by\nt\ni\nd Wick\nf, H}\nAt f = [H, AWick\nf ]\u22c6Wick = {AWick\nt\nt\ndt\n~\n\n(4.11)\n\nfor f \u2208 C \u221e (S \u00d7 B)[[~]] due to the fact that H = \u03bd2 z 1 z1 + \u03bd2\u03ba z 2 z2 . It immediately follows that the\ntime evolution is just the classical one, i.e. AWick\n= \u03a6\u2217t , and no higher order correction terms arise.\nt\nBut then it is clear that the time evolution with respect to \u22c6 is given by conjugation with S since\n\u03ba\nSH = H + c with a constant c = ~ \u03bd+\u03bd\n2 . Hence, we have\nAt = S \u22121 \u25e6 \u03a6\u2217t \u25e6 S.\n\n(4.12)\n\nAs a consequence we immediately obtain the following result for the open time evolution with\nrespect to the Weyl-Moyal star product:\nProposition 4.2 The deformed time evolution of the open subsystem with respect to the functional\n\u03c9 is given by\nb \u03c9) \u25e6 S \u22121 \u25e6 \u03a6\u2217t \u25e6 S \u25e6 pr\u2217S .\nA\u03c9t = (id \u2297\n(4.13)\n14\n\n\fRemark 4.3 The \u2217 -automorphism At obviously restricts to the polynomials Pol (S \u00d7 B) [~]. Thus,\nbeing only interested in polynomial observables leads to a convergent formulation of the deformed\ntime evolution of the open harmonic oscillator if the quantized state \u03c9 used to reduce the total\ndynamics gives a finite order in ~ for every polynomial on the bath. This will be the case for the\ndeformed \u03b4-functionals as well as for the KMS functionals in Section 5. Thence, here we recover\nthe usual quantum mechanical formulation including the convergence in ~.\nTo further illustrate the above situation we compute the open time evolution of some specific\nobservables of the system. Here we still allow for a general state \u03c9.\nAs a first step we calculate the total quantum time evolutions of the total system for qS and pS .\nTo do so, we will have to evaluate the chain of maps (4.13) applied to these observables. First we\nnote that\nSqS = qS = S \u22121 qS and SpS = pS = S \u22121 pS .\n(4.14)\nThen the classical time evolution is linear whence applying the transformation S \u22121 again does not\ngive additional terms.

The procedure is very simple: we will have to replace all bath variables by\ntheir expectation values with respect to \u03c9, i.e. qB is to be replaced by \u03c9(qB ), qB pB is replaced by\n\u03c9(pB pB ) et cetera. We will not write down the explicit formulas as these are now obtained from\n(4.19), (4.20), and (4.21) just by copying.\nRemark 4.4 Note that for these observables, the open time evolutions in the classical and quantum\nregime only differ by the (possibly) different expectation values with respect to \u03c9 and its classical\nlimit \u03c90 . In general, we have to expect additional quantum corrections from the total time evolution\nas well.\n\n16\n\n\f5\n\nLinearly Coupled Harmonic Oscillators II: Examples\n\nThe first example of a state for the bath is a deformation of the \u03b4-functional. Thus, fix a point\n(qB 0 , pB 0 ) in the bath and consider \u03b4(q ,p ) . For the Weyl-Moyal star product this will no longer be\nB0 B0\na positive functional, see e.g. [24, Sect. 7.1.3]. However, for the Wick star product \u22c6Wick\non the bath\nB\nthe \u03b4-functional will be positive without corrections. Thus using the equivalence transformation\nSB we obtain a positive functional \u03b4(q ,p ) \u25e6 SB with respect to the Weyl-Moyal star product.\nB0 B0\nNote that the equivalence transformation SB is precisely a map preserving squares with respect\nto the Weyl-Moyal star product which is evident from the explicit formula for \u22c6Wick\n. In fact, this\nB\nwas the first example of a map preserving squares which is also heavily used in the proofs in [10].\nMore physically speaking, \u03b4(q ,p ) \u25e6 SB corresponds to a coherent state localized around the point\nB0 B0\n(qB 0 , pB 0 ).\nFor this particular state we note that for the observables at most linear in qB and pB the\noperator SB does not have a non-trivial effect. Moreover, for the quadratic terms qB2 , p2B , and qB pB\nthe operator SB only gives a correction term in first order of ~. Explicitly, we obtain\nSB q B = q B ,\n\nSB pB = pB ,\n\nSB (qB pB ) = qB pB ,\n\n(5.1)\n\nm\u03bd\n1\n, and SB p2B = p2B + ~\n.\n(5.2)\n2m\u03bd\n2\nFrom these computations we see that the open time evolutions with respect to \u03b4(q ,p ) \u25e6 SB\nB 0 B0\nare given by\n\u0012\n\u0013\nSB qB2 = qB2 + ~\n\n\u03b4q\n\n,p\n\n\u03b4q\n\n,p\n\nB0\n\nAt\n\nAt\n\u03b4q\n\nAt\n\nB0\n\n,p\n\nB0\n\n~\n+\n16\n\n\u25e6SB\n\nHS =\n\n\u0012\n\n\u03b4q\n\n\u03a6t\n\nB0\n\n,p\n\nB0\n\n\u0013\u2217\n\nB0\n\nB0\n\n\u25e6SB\n\nB0\n\n\u25e6SB\n\n(qS ) =\n\n(pS ) =\n\n\u03b4q\n\n,p\n\n\u03b4q\n\n,p\n\n\u03a6t\n\n\u0012\n\n\u03a6t\n\nB0\n\nB0\n\nB0\n\nB0\n\n\u2217\n\n\u0013\u2217\n\nqS ,\n\n(5.3)\n\npS ,\n\n(5.4)\n\nHS\n\n!\n\u0012\n\u00132\n1\n\u03bd\n2\n(\u03bd sin(\u03bdt) \u2212 \u03bd\u03ba sin(\u03bd\u03ba t)) + \u03bd sin(\u03bdt) \u2212\nsin(\u03bd\u03ba t) + 2\u03bd (cos(\u03bdt) \u2212 cos(\u03bd\u03ba t)) .\n\u03bd\n\u03bd\u03ba\n\n(5.5)\n\nRemark 5.1 The classical open time evolutions of qS , pS , and HS in (5.3), (5.4), and (5.5) are\nobtained by replacing the functions qB , pB , and their powers in the Equations (4.19), (4.20), and\n(4.21) by their values at qB 0 and pB 0 .\nRemark 5.2 The deformation of the \u03b4-functional necessary in order to ensure complete positivity\nleads to non-classical components of the open time evolution.\nNext we will study quantized states fulfilling a formal KMS condition, corresponding to \"thermal\nequilibrium states\" of the bath.\nTo this end, we first recall that for every symplectic star product \u22c6 for C \u221e (M )[[~]] there is a\nunique trace functional\n(5.6)\ntr : C0\u221e (M )[[~]] \u2212\u2192 [[~]],\n\nC\n\n17\n\n\fi.e. tr(f \u22c6 g) = tr(g \u22c6 f ). Choosing the normalization of tr appropriately one obtains a positive trace,\nsee e.g. [24, Sect. 6.3.5] for a detailed discussion and references. For the Weyl-Moyal star product,\nthe trace is known to be\nZ\nf (x) d2n x,\n(5.7)\ntr(f ) =\n\nR2n\n\ni.e. the integration with respect to the Liouville volume. In fact, it can be shown that in the\nsymplectic case the lowest order of tr is necessarily of this form: it is just the integration over the\nwhole manifold with respect to the Liouville volume.\nThe second ingredient we need is the \u22c6-exponential Exp, as introduced in [3]. Instead of defining\nthe exponential function by means of the series, the following approach favoured in [5], see also [24,\nSect. 6.3.1], will be used. For H \u2208 C \u221e (M )[[~]] one defines Exp(\u03b2H) \u2208 C \u221e (M )[[~]] to be the unique\nsolution of the differential equation\nd\nExp(\u03b2H) = H \u22c6 Exp(\u03b2H)\nd\u03b2\n\n(5.8)\n\nwith initial condition Exp(0) = 1. The classical limit of Exp(H) is the ordinary exponential exp(H0 ).\nThe KMS condition for inverse temperature \u03b2 and Hamiltonian H for a [[~]]-linear functional as\nformulated in [1, 2] in the context of deformation quantization, leads to the following result: up to\nnormalization the KMS functional is uniquely determined and explicitly given by\n\nC\n\n\u03bcKMS (f ) = tr(Exp(\u2212\u03b2H) \u22c6 f ) for f \u2208 C0\u221e (M )[[~]]\n\n(5.9)\n\nsee [5] for the proof and [24, Sect. 7.1.4] for more details on KMS functionals. In particular, we\nnote that (5.9) is a positive functional.\nRemark 5.3 Depending on the Hamiltonian H, \u03bcKMS may or may not be normalizable. Whenever\nthe Hamiltonian used permits a normalization by rendering the integrations in \u03bcKMS (1) well-defined,\n1\nwe will denote \u03bcKMS\n(1) \u03bcKMS by \u03c9KMS and call it a KMS state.\nBefore entering the particular example again, we note that in the symplectic case the open\nquantum time evolution with respect to a KMS functional is necessarily completely positive. This\nwill follow at once from this proposition:\nProposition 5.4 Let the system be an arbitrary Poisson manifold and let the bath be symplectic. Given the KMS functional \u03bcKMS with respect to an arbitrary HB \u2208 C \u221e (B)[[~]] and inverse\nb \u03bcKMS : (C0\u221e (S \u00d7 B)[[~]], \u22c6) \u2212\u2192 (C0\u221e (S)[[~]], \u22c6S ) is completely positive.\ntemperature \u03b2, the map id \u2297\n\nProof: We choose a map S for the bath whose existence is guaranteed by Theorem 3.5. In the proof\nof Theorem 3.13 we have seen that for every positive [[~]]-linear functional \u03bc : Mn (C0\u221e (S)[[~]]) \u2212\u2192\n[[~]] the combined map\n\nC\n\nC\n\nb S : (Mn (C0\u221e (S \u00d7 B)[[~]]), \u22c6) \u2212\u2192 (C0\u221e (B)[[~]], *)\n\u03bc\u2297\n\nb S)(F \u2217 \u22c6F ) is at every point\nis positive. It follows that for F \u2208 Mn (C0\u221e (S \u00d7 B)[[~]]) the function (\u03bc \u2297\nxB \u2208 B either a formal series with positive lowest order term or zero. To avoid trivialities, assume\nb S)(F \u2217 \u22c6 F ) is not identically zero. Let r0 be the minimal exponent with (\u03bc \u2297\nb S)(F \u2217 \u22c6 F ) =\nthat (\u03bc \u2297\nr\n0\n~ ar0 + * * * and ar0 \u2265 0 not identically zero. By continuity, there is an open subset U \u2286 B with\nb S)(F \u2217 \u22c6 F ) = ~r0 br0 + * * * with\nar0 (xB ) > 0 for xB \u2208 U . But this implies that (\u03bcKMS \u25e6 S\u22121 ) \u25e6 (\u03bc \u2297\nbr0 > 0 since the zeroth order of S is the identity and the zeroth order of \u03bcKMS is the integration\nover all of B. Since \u03bc is arbitrary and using\nb S) = \u03bc \u25e6 (id \u2297\nb \u03bcKMS ),\n(\u03bcKMS \u25e6 S\u22121 ) \u25e6 (\u03bc \u2297\n18\n\n\fb \u03bcKMS )(F \u2217 \u22c6 F ) is a positive algebra element in Mn (C0\u221e (S)[[~]]) with respect\nthis shows that (id \u2297\nto \u22c6S .\n\u0004\nBack to our specific example, we consider the harmonic oscillator as the Hamiltonian HB \u2208\nC \u221e ( 2 ) and the Weyl-Moyal star product \u22c6B as before. In this case, the star exponential of HB\nhas been computed explicitly by [3]. One has\n\u0012\n\u0012\n\u0013\u0013\n2HB\n~\u03b2\u03bd\n1\n\u0011\n\u0010\nexp \u2212\ntanh\n(5.10)\nExp(\u2212\u03b2HB ) =\n~\u03bd\n2\ncosh ~\u03b2\u03bd\n\nR\n\n2\n\nfor \u03b2 > 0 and \u03bd > 0, which is a well-defined formal power series in ~. Note that in [3] the\nexponential Exp( it~ H) requires a convergent setting due to the ~ in the denominator. In our case,\nthe situation is much simpler. In fact, differentiating (5.10) with respect to \u03b2 gives the defining\ndifferential equation (5.8) right away.\nAs in the textbooks on statistical mechanics, we can now calculate the partition function Z as\nthe normalization factor of the KMS state on the bath by formally calculating Gaussian integrals.\nProposition 5.5 The normalization factor \u03bcKMS (1) is explicitly given by\n\u0010\n\u0011\nexp \u2212 ~\u03b2\u03bd\n2\n\u2208 [[~]].\n\u03bcKMS (1) = 2\u03c0~\n1 \u2212 exp (\u2212~\u03b2\u03bd)\nThe partition function is the formal Laurent series\n\u0011\n\u0010\nexp \u2212 ~\u03b2\u03bd\n2\nZ=\n\u2208\n1 \u2212 exp (\u2212~\u03b2\u03bd)\n\nR\n\n(5.11)\n\nR((~)).\n\n(5.12)\n\nThe crucial point is that \u03bcKMS (1) has a well-defined classical limit while Z has a simple pole at\n~ = 0. Therefore, we can use this normalization factor to obtain the well-defined KMS state\nZ\n1\n\u03c9KMS (f ) =\nExp(\u2212\u03b2HB ) \u22c6B f dqB dpB\n(5.13)\n2\u03c0~Z\nfor f \u2208 C \u221e (B)[[~]] such that the integral (5.13) is convergent order by order in ~. Note that the\ninverse of 2\u03c0~Z is again a well-defined formal power series.\nAs for the \u03b4-functional, we shall now compute the open quantum time evolution of the observables qS , pS , and HS also with respect to the KMS state \u03c9KMS . To this end, we need the expectation\nvalues of qB , pB , qB2 , p2B , and qB pB in order to evaluate (4.19), (4.20), and (4.21).\nLemma 5.6 One has the following expectation values\n\u03c9KMS (qB ) = \u03c9KMS (pB ) = \u03c9KMS (qB pB ) = 0,\n\u03c9KMS (qB2 ) =\n\n3~\n2m\u03bd tanh\n\nwhich are formal power series in\n\n\u0010\n\nC[[~]].\n\n~\u03b2\u03bd\n2\n\n\u0011,\n\nand\n\n\u03c9KMS (p2B ) =\n\n3m\u03bd~\n\u0010\n\u0011,\n2 tanh ~\u03b2\u03bd\n2\n\n(5.14)\n(5.15)\n\nProof: This is of course textbook knowledge. Nevertheless, we sketch the computation in order\nto illustrate the star product formalism used. The first observation is that the trace functional tr\nfor the Weyl-Moyal star product has the remarkable feature\ntr(f \u22c6 g) = tr(f g),\n19\n\n\fsee e.g. [24, Ex. 6.3.33]. Strictly speaking, one of the functions has to have compact support.\nHowever, if one is the Gaussian Exp(\u2212\u03b2HB ) then the rapid decay allows to perform the integrations\nby parts also for observables like polynomials. Thus we can use this feature to simplify \u03c9KMS (f )\nconsiderably for the above observables. Since Exp(\u2212\u03b2HB ) is just a Gaussian we are left with the\nwell-known computation of some Gaussian integrals.\n\u0004\nUsing these expectation values, we can apply the general formulas (4.19), (4.20), and (4.21) and\nsubstitute there the observables qB , pB , qB pB , qB2 , and p2B by their expectation values with respect\nto \u03c9KMS . This then gives the open time evolutions of qS , pS and HS . Remarkably, many terms\ndisappear thanks to the vanishing of (5.14).
