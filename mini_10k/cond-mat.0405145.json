Thus, the model presented here emerges as a powerful tool\nto provide preliminary, fast yet accurate characterizations of proteins near-native motion.\n\nI.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nConsiderable insight into the biological activity of a protein can be gained by identifying its large-scale functional movements.\nIdeal tools for a detailed characterization of such dynamical properties are constituted by computational techniques such as\nmolecular dynamics (MD) simulations based on effective all-atom potentials [1]. By these means it is possible, at present, to\nfollow numerically the dynamical evolution of a protein of a few hundred residues in its surrounding solvent over time intervals\nof tens of nanoseconds.\nSuch time-scales allow to gain considerable insight into important aspects of protein dynamics and to make quantitative connections with experimental quantities such as NMR order parameters [2, 3] and Trp fluorescence spectra [4]. Other complex\nconformational changes are however difficult or impossible to be observed. Examples include protein-protein molecular recognition, rearrangements occuring upon ligand binding etc. which all involve time-scales of the order of 1 \u03bcs or longer[5]. In\naddition, the simulated trajectory might not be sufficiently long that thermodynamic averages can be legitimately replaced with\ndynamical ones[6].\nSeveral studies have attempted to bridge the gap between the time scales of feasible MD simulations and the ones of\nbiologically-relevant protein motion by recoursing to a mesoscopic rather than a microscopic approach[7]. In fact, the large-scale\ndynamical features encountered in MD trajectories can be conveniently interpreted, at a first approximation, as a superposition\nof independent harmonic modes [5]. This observation was complemented by Tirion who pointed out that, in a normal mode\nanalysis of protein vibrations, the detailed classical force-field could be replaced by suitable harmonic couplings with the same\nspring constants [7]. These results stimulated a variety of studies where the elastic properties of proteins were described through\ncoarse-grained models where amino acids are replaced by effective centroids corresponding to the C\u03b1 atoms and the energy\nfunction is reduced to harmonic couplings between pairs of spatially close centroids. These approaches, in particular the Gaussian and anisotropic network models (GNM and ANM), have been found to be in accord with both experimental and MD results\n[8, 9, 10].\nHere we introduce an extended network gaussian model which, at variance with previous approaches, incorporates effective\nC\u03b2 centroids \"tethered\" to the C\u03b1 atoms. The presence of the effective C\u03b2 's allows a good control of the directionality of pairwise\ninteractions in the protein and thus leads to an improved vibrational description. Furthermore, the fact that the sidechains degrees\nof freedom are entirely controlled by the C\u03b1 's has the crucial implication that the computational effort required to characterize\nthe system is exactly the same as for models based only on C\u03b1 's.\nThe model equilibrium dynamics is compared against MD simulations based on all-atom effective potentials. We provide\nseveral quantitative estimates for how and in what sense, the simplified quadratic approaches can provide a complement of the\nmore accurate but also much more computationally-demanding all-atom potential based MD calculations. From a general point\nof view, the ideal term of reference would be constituted by a direct experimental determination of the quantities of interest here,\nsuch as the correlation of residues' motion. However, since this is not presently feasible, such detailed information can only be\nobtained from MD simulations. Although such simulations do not provide an absolute term of comparison, it is certainly an\nadequate reference for the much simplified protein models and energy functionals considered here.\nThe reference system considered here is the complex formed by the HIV-1 protease dimer with a bound model substrate (Fig.\n1). This protein appears to be suitable to serve as reference for our model calculations in many respects. First, its dynamics in\n\n\f2\n\nFIG. 1: Backbone trace of the complex formed by the HIV-1 protease homodimer and the bound substrate. Each monomer is composed of 99\nresidues; The model substrate consists of six amino acids [11, 12].\n\naqueous solution has been extensively investigated over more than 10 ns by all-atom effective potentials MD simulation [11, 12].\nSecond, a large-scale motion analysis based on this MD simulation has been already performed. Third, this protein/substrate\ncomplex does not contain metal ions, prostetic groups, cofactors or non standard amino acids, and therefore it is amenable as\na first test system for our model calculations, which consider only standard amino acids. Finally, this protein is of outstanding\npharmaceutical relevance (it is one of the two targets currently used in anti-AIDS therapy) and its dynamics has been revealed\nas a key ingredient for the enzymatic function and for rationalizing resistance data [11, 13, 14, 15].\nThe data obtained from the MD simulation of refs. [11, 12] have been used here to evaluate all the MD-related quantities\nused for comparison against the results for quadratic models. In support of the general applicability of Gaussian approaches to\ncapture the details of proteins essential motion we also report a comparison of the model predictions against data from a recent\nMD study of the NGF-trkA complex formed by the nerve growth factor and the tyrosin Kinase A receptor[16].\nII. THEORY\nA.\n\nThe model\n\nThe starting point of the present analysis is the expansion of the Hamiltonian in terms of the deviations of the amino acids\nfrom their reference native positions. The underlying assumption is that a protein immersed in aqueous solution vibrates around\nits native state with amplitudes so small to justify the quadratic expansion around the minimum of the potential energy function.\nA posteriori this does not seem to be a drastic restriction [5, 9, 17] despite both the large-amplitude of motion observed in\ndynamical trajectory and the existence of several native sub-states, instead of a unique energy minimum [18].\nTo reduce the spatial degrees of freedom of a protein we adopt a coarse-grained model where a two-particle representation is\nused for each amino acid: besides the C\u03b1 atom, an effective C\u03b2 centroid is employed to capture, in the simplest possible way,\nthe sidechain orientation in a given amino acid (except for GLY for which only the C\u03b1 atom is retained). To distinguish the\nproposed model from those based on the C\u03b1 only representation will shall refer to it as the \u03b2 Gaussian model (\u03b2GM for brevity).\nSince our focus is to study the concerted vibration of various amino acids around the native state of the system, the Hamiltonian\nthat is adopted incorporates, accordingly, pairwise interactions between all pairs of particles that are sufficiently spatially close\nin the native state. Formally, the system energy function evaluated on a trial structure, \u0393, takes on the form\nH(\u0393) = HBB (\u0393) + H\u03b1\u03b1 (\u0393) + H\u03b1\u03b2 (\u0393) + H\u03b2\u03b2 (\u0393)\nwhere\nHBB (\u0393) = k\n\nX\n\nCA\u2212CA\nV CA\u2212CA (di,i+1\n)\n\ni\n\nH\u03b1\u03b1 (\u0393) =\n\nX\n\nCA\u2212CA CA\u2212CA CA\u2212CA\n\u2206ij\nV\n(di,j\n)\n\ni<j\n\nH\u03b1\u03b2 (\u0393) =\n\nX\ni,j\n\nCA\u2212CB CA\u2212CB CA\u2212CB\n\u2206ij\nV\n(di,j\n)\n\n(1)\n\n\f3\nH\u03b2\u03b2 (\u0393) =\n\nX\n\n\u2206CB\u2212CB\nV CB\u2212CB (dCB\u2212CB\n),\nij\ni,j\n\n(2)\n\ni<j\n\nIn expressions (2) \u2206XY\nis the native contact matrix that takes on the values of 1 [0] if the native separation of the effective\nij\nparticles of type X and Y , belonging respectively to residues i and j, is below [above] a certain cutoff value, R. With dXY\nij , on\nthe other hand, we denote the actual separation of the particles in the trial structure, \u0393. The indices i and j run over all integer\nvalues ranging from 1 up to the protein length, N . In particular, the interaction between particles in consecutive amino acids,\n|i \u2212 j| = 1, leads to a simple treatment of the protein chain connectivity. However, to account for the much higher strength of\nthe peptide bond with respect to non-covalent contact interactions between amino acids, we have added in (1) an explicit chain\nterm, HBB , where the interaction of consecutive C\u03b1 's is controlled by k > 0.\nBy construction, the minimum of the various interaction terms is attained for the native separation of each pair of particles.\nThis ensures that the native state is at the global energy minimum. For small fluctuations around the native structure, the potential\ninteraction energy of two particles, i and j, can be expanded in terms of the deviations from the native distance-vector, ~rij . If\nwe indicate the deviation vector as ~xij , so that the total distance vector is d~ij = ~rij + ~xij , we can approximate the pairwise\ninteraction as\n\nV (dij ) \u2248 V (rij ) +\n\n\u03bc \u03bd\nV \u2032\u2032 (rij ) X rij rij\nx\u03bcij x\u03bdij\n2\n2\nr\nij\n\u03bc,\u03bd\n\n(3)\n\nwhere \u03bc and \u03bd denote the cartesian components, x, y and z, and V \u2032\u2032 is the second derivative of V . Several models have been\nintroduced previously, where the quadratic expansion (3) was used in a context where only interactions among C\u03b1 centroids\nwhere considered, such as in the anisotropic gaussian model (ANM), recently introduced to study the vibrational spectrum of\nproteins [10].\nBased on this quadratic expansion the Hamiltonian of eq. (1) can be approximated as,\n\nH\u0303 =\n\n1 X CA CA\u2212CA CA\nx M\nxj,\u03bd ,\n2 ij,\u03bc\u03bd i,\u03bc ij,\u03bc\u03bd\n\n(4)\n\nwhere M is a 3N x3N symmetric matrix. The elastic response of the system is uniquely dictated by the eigenvalues and\neigenvectors of M .\nWhat differentiates the \u03b2GM from several previous studies is the presence of the interactions between C\u03b1 and C\u03b2 and C\u03b2 -C\u03b2\n(besides the extra strength of the chain term). The introduction of the C\u03b2 centroids in the protein description leads, in principle,\nto a more complicated Hamiltonian, with the additional C\u03b2 's degrees of freedom:\nH=\n\n1 X CA CA\u2212CA CA\nx M\nxj,\u03bd\n2 ij,\u03bc\u03bd i,\u03bc ij,\u03bc\u03bd\nX\nCA\u2212CB CB\nxj,\u03bd\nxCA\n+\ni,\u03bc Mij,\u03bc\u03bd\nij,\u03bc\u03bd\n\n1 X CB CB\u2212CB CB\n+\nx M\nxj,\u03bd .\n2 ij,\u03bc\u03bd i,\u03bc ij,\u03bc\u03bd\n\n(5)\n\nHowever, the location of the C\u03b2 atoms in a protein structure is almost uniquely specified by the geometry of the peptide chain.\nAn accurate method that predicts the location of the C\u03b2 atoms from the CA trace of a protein is the geometric construction of\nPark and Levitt[19], which assigns the ith C\u03b2 location given the positions of the C\u03b1 's of residues i \u2212 1, i and i + 1, allows\nto place the fictitious C\u03b2 at a distance of 0.3 \u00c5 from the crystallographic location. Such excellent agreement clarifies that the\ndegrees of freedom of the C\u03b2 centroids should not be considered independent from the C\u03b1 ones. On the contrary, the C\u03b2 's can\nbe viewed as rigidly \"tethered\" to the C\u03b1 and hence the fluctuations of the former are dictated by those of the latter.\nAlthough in principle one could use the original rule of Park and Levitt[19], we have adopted a simpler construction scheme\nwhich places the C\u03b2 exactly in the plane specified by the local C\u03b1 trace. This simplifies the construction of the M matrices\nwhich remain \"diagonal\" in the cartesian components (e.g. the x component of the reconstructed C\u03b2 depends only on the x\ncomponents of the neighbouring C\u03b1 's. More precisely, the location of the ith C\u03b2 is given by\n\n~rCB (i) = ~rCA (i) + l\n\n2 ~rCA (i) \u2212 ~rCA (i + 1) \u2212 ~rCA (i \u2212 1)\n|2 ~rCA (i) \u2212 ~rCA (i + 1) \u2212 ~rCA (i \u2212 1)|\n\n(6)\n\n\f4\nFor reasons of self-consistency of the model, this construction rule is used to determine the contact matrices involving the\neffective C\u03b2 centroids that are used in place of those depending on the crystallographic C\u03b2 locations in eqn (2). To leading order\nin the deviations of the C\u03b1 atoms, the deviations of rCB (i) thus becomes:\n~xCB (i) \u2248 l\n\n2 ~xCA (i) \u2212 ~xCA (i + 1) \u2212 ~xCA (i \u2212 1)\n.\n|2 ~rCA (i) \u2212 ~rCA (i + 1) \u2212 ~rCA (i \u2212 1)|\n\n(7)\n\nwhere l = 3 \u00c5. By using this rule, one parametrizes, in terms of the C\u03b1 positions the effective C\u03b2 location of all residues\nexcept for GLY and for the initial and final residues which lack one of the flanking C\u03b1 's. When the resulting expressions (7)\nare substituted in equation (5) one obtains an effective quadratic Hamiltonian which, as in equation (4) involves only the C\u03b1\ndeviations but coupled through a new effective matrix, M\u0303 which is distinguished from previous matrices by a tilde superscript.\nThe book-keeping operations necessary to calculate the elements of such matrix are conveniently implemented with the aid of a\ncomputer. Thus, the computational cost and difficulty to characterize the elastic response of the protein is reduced to exactly the\nsame as models with C\u03b1 atoms only. In spite of the same computational cost, the \u03b2GM appears to have several advantages in\nterms of the ability to capture the low-frequency motion and other vibrational properties of proteins, as will be seen below.\nB. Equilibrium properties\n\nThe derivation of the vibrational properties of a protein from the quadratic expansion of the Hamiltonian can be done, broadly\nspeaking, in two different ways: the normal mode analysis and the Langevin analysis. What differentiates the two approaches\nis the view of the role of the solvent on the system dynamics. If one assumes that the motion of the protein is not significantly\ndamped by the interaction with the solvent, then the normal modes picture can be applied to study the system dynamics around\nthe native state by solving the Newton's dynamical equations [17, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26]:\nmi \u1e8di,\u03bc =\n\nX\n\nM\u0303ij,\u03bc\u03bd xCA\nj,\u03bd\n\n(8)\n\nj,\u03bd\n\nThe eigenfrequecies and eigenvectors are hence obtained by diagonalizing a matrix derived from M\u0303 by an appropriate massweighting [27].\nAlthough the normal-mode analysis allows a straightforward dynamical characterization it is of dubious applicability since\nprotein motion in a solvent does not resemble a superposition of pure harmonic oscillations. In fact, several theoretical, experimental and computational studies, have shown that the dynamics of a protein is severely overdamped by the interaction with the\nsolvent [21, 23, 28, 29]. The description of the motion in terms of overdamped dynamics appears to be particularly valid for the\nprotein's low-frequency vibrations, that are the most interesting ones due to their expected role in proteins functional activities\n[26]. This observation leads to the alternative view of a heavily damped dynamics [30].\nIn this case, for small deviations from the reference positions, the dynamics of the amino acids can be written as:\n\u1e8bi,\u03bc (t) = \u2212\n\nX\n\nM\u0303ij,\u03bc\u03bd xj,\u03bd (t) + \u03b7i,\u03bc (t)\n\n(9)\n\nj,\u03bd\n\nwhere the time unit has been implicitly chosen so that the viscosity coefficients (assumed to be equal for all particles) are set\nequal to 1 and the stochastic noise terms satisfy [31]:\nh\u03b7i,\u03bc i = 0\nh\u03b7i,\u03bc \u03b7j,\u03bd i = \u03b4i,j \u03b4\u03bc,\u03bd 2\u03baB T .\n\n(10)\n(11)\n\nThese two conditions ensure, in the long run, the onset of canonical thermal equilibrium, so that the equilibrium probability of a\ngiven configuration, {x}, for the particles in the system is controlled by the Boltzmann factor:\ne\u2212\u03b2H({x}) = e\n\n\u2212\u03b2\n\nP\n\nij,\u03bc\u03bd\n\nxi,\u03bc M\u0303ij,\u03bc\u03bd xj,\u03bd\n\n.\n\n(12)\n\nIn this case, no periodic motion of the system can exist in the absence of external periodic excitations, since any structural\ndeformation will be dissipated by a damped dynamics. The standard theory of stochastic processes [20, 31] shows that the\neigenvalues of M\u0303 are inversely proportional to the system relaxation times, and the corresponding eigenvectors indicate the\nactual shape of the associated distortion of the system.\n\n\f5\nC.\n\nCovariance matrices and temperature-factors\n\nBesides identifying the elementary modes of excitation of a protein, it is important to calculate suitable thermodynamic\nquantities that characterize the protein dynamics once thermal equilibrium with the solvent has established. The main observable\nthat can be calculated within the gaussian model is the degree of correlation of the displacement from the equilibrium (native\nposition) of pairs of C\u03b1 's. The thermodynamic average of the correlated displacements, are easily obtained from the inversion\nof the M matrix. In fact, after setting 1/\u03b2 = KB T = 1, one has\n\u22121\nhxi,\u03bc xj,\u03bd i = M\u0303ij,\u03bc\u03bd\n\n(13)\n\n\u22121\nwhere the brackets denote usual canonical thermodynamic averages with the weight of eqn. (12). The inverse matrix, M\u0303ij,\u03bc\u03bd\n, is\noften referred to as the covariance matrix. Since it provides directional details about the correlated motion of pairs of residues\nwe shall term it full covariance matrix to distinguish it from the reduced one discussed below which incorporates only a measure\nof the degree of correlation (but no directional information).\nThe eigenvectors of the full covariance matrix represent the three-dimensional independent modes of structural distortion\nfor the reference protein. The modes associated to the largest eigenvalues of M\u0303 \u22121 are the slowest to decay in a dissipative\ndynamics and, hence, make the largest contribution to the mean-square displacement of a given residues. The latter quantity is\nstraightforwardly calculated from eqn. (13):\n\nh|~xi |2 i =\n\nX\n\n\u22121\nM\u0303ii,\u03bc\u03bc\n\n(14)\n\n\u03bc\n\nand can be directly connected to the temperature-factors (also called B-factors) measurements reported in X-ray or highresolution NMR structural determinations [32].\nIt is worth remarking that the full covariance matrix provides information about the system elasticity not only in conditions of\nisolation but also when an external force, f~i , is applied to a given residue, i. In fact, within the Gaussian approximation, the\naverage displacement of the jth amino acid from its reference position due to the application of f~i is given by\nhxj,\u03bd i \u221d\n\nX\n\n\u22121\nM\u0303ji,\u03bd\u03bc\nfi,\u03bc .\n\n(15)\n\n\u03bc\n\nAs anticipated above, an important role in the analysis of molecular dynamical trajectories is also played by the reduced covariance matrix whose elements, Cij , are defined as\nCij \u2261 h~xi * ~xj i =\n\nX\n\n\u22121\nM\u0303ij,\u03bc\u03bc\n\n(16)\n\n\u03bc\n\nIn ordinary MD simulations, the thermodynamic average in (16) is replaced with the time average taken over the simulated\ntrajectory (ergodicity assumption). Due to the fact that the C matrix is obtained from M\u0303 \u22121 after a summation over the cartesian\ncomponents, the linear size of C is equal to the number of protein residues, N , instead of 3N as for M\u0303 \u22121 . This ten-fold reduction\nof information greatly simplifies the identification of significant correlations between residues motion.\nWe conclude this section by discussing a technically important point. The inversion of the M\u0303 matrix used in eqns. (13\u201316),\nas well as a correct interpretation of equation (12) are possible only within the subspace orthogonal to the eigenvectors of M\u0303\nassociated with zero eigenvalues. Physically this corresponds to omit the structural modifications that cost no energy (zero\nmodes). Due to the invariance of Hamiltonian (1) under rotations and translations of the Cartesian reference frame, there will\nalways be at least six zero modes. This number can, however, be larger if the M\u0303 matrix is sparse.The presence of additional\nspurious modes in Gaussian network models that incorporate only C\u03b1 coordinates is usually achieved by two means: either a\nreduction of the dimensionality of M\u0303 (as in GNM) or by using large interaction cutoffs in the range 10-15 \u00c5(as in ANM). The\nmodel discussed here allows to use physically-appealing interaction cutoffs of the order of 7 \u00c5, as for GNM, and yet retaining\nthe full three-dimensional detail in the M\u0303 matrix. As will be shown later, these ingredients are necessary to capture the finer\naspects of protein vibrations such as the correlation of residues' motion, while, consistently with previous studies, the overall\nmobility of individual residues is rather insensitive to the details of the model [33, 34].\nIn fact, we found that GNM, ANM and \u03b2GM have a similar performance on the prediction of experimental B-factors. This\nwas established using high-resolution, single-chain proteins taken from the non-redundant pdb-select list [35]. We restricted\nto proteins length between 50 and 200 residues and excluded from the comparison the first and last 5 residues to avoid biases\n\n\f6\ndue to enhanced terminal mobility. Overall we selected 36 proteins determined with Xray and 31 with NMR. For simplicity we\nsummarise the level of agreement as the average of the non-parametric rank correlation, \u03c4 [36]. This analysis does not rely on the\nknowledge of the probability distribution from which the points (pairs of data) are taken. What matters is the agreement of the\nranking of the points according to each of the two variables. In case of perfect [anti]-correlation the Kendall parameter \u03c4 takes\non the value 1 [-1] and usually provides a more stringent (and robust) measure than linear correlation[37]. For the X-ray set and\nusing GNM, \u03c4 ranged from 0.37 to 0.39 for cutoffs in the range 7.5 - 15 \u00c5. For the same range \u03b2GM gave 0.34 < \u03c4 < 0.37, while\nfor ANM 0.30 < \u03c4 < 0.37 for interaction ranges 10-15 \u00c5. The comparison against NMR temperature-factors provided higher\ncorrelations as already observed in ref. [32]. For the same cutoff ranges reported above one has for GNM: 0.45 < \u03c4 < 0.47, for\n\u03b2GM: 0.46 < \u03c4 < 0.48 and for ANM 0.42 < \u03c4 < 0.48.\nIn summary, the novel model discussed here allows to incorporate, in an effective Hamiltonian, not only backbone-backbone\ninteractions but also backbone-sidechain and sidechain-sidechain ones. The sidechain degrees of freedom are entirely controlled\nby the C\u03b1 positions. This has the crucial implication that the computational effort required to characterize the vibrational\nproperties of the system is exactly the same as for models that incorporate only interactions between C\u03b1 pairs.\nIII.\n\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION\n\nIn this section we shall examine the extent to which suitable topology-based harmonic models can capture the details of the\nnear-native vibrations of proteins in thermal equilibrium. Given the present impossibility to probe experimentally the various\nthermodynamical quantities discussed before, it is mandatory to choose as a reference the results of an all-atom molecular\ndynamics calculation performed on the HIV-1 protease, in complex with TIMMNR peptide model substrate [11, 12]. All MD\ndynamical averages were calculated after discarding an initial interval of a few ns over which the protease complexed to the\nmodel substrate was equilibrated [11, 12]. The configuration obtained of the end of the equilibration protocol was taken as the\nreference structure for the Gaussian approach. The inversion of the symmetric M\u0303 matrix, necessary to characterize the system\nequilibrium dynamics, was done exploiting the Householder reduction [37] and took about 10 minutes on a personal computer.\nFor the comparison, it is important to remark that although molecular dynamics studies can reproduce reliably a variety\nof experimental quantities they ultimately rely on empirical potentials which may be imperfectly parametrised. Besides this\nissue, it should also be noted that, usually, it is not easy to ascertain whether the simulated trajectory is sufficiently long that\nthermodynamic averages as in eq. (16) can be legitimately replaced with dynamical ones, though a recent study has indicated\nsome valuable criteria for this purpose [6]. This potential limitations of general MD approaches should therefore be borne in\nmind also in the present context.\nThe series of tests carried out to ascertain the consistency among MD results and the one of gaussian models include the\ncomparison of temperature factors, covariance matrices and essential subspaces. The findings, summarised below, provide a\ndirect and strong indication that the \u03b2GM is apt for capturing several aspects of proteins' near-native vibrational dynamics with\nan accuracy that rivals with techniques based on all-atom potentials.\nThe generalised energy function of eq. (1) contains several parameters; one of these, the interaction amplitude of C\u03b1 pairs,\n\u2032\u2032\nVCA\u2212CA\n, can be conveniently taken as the energy unit. The other parameters are the interaction cutoff, R (which enters in the\ndefinition of the contact matrices) and the amplitudes of the C\u03b2 -C\u03b2 and C\u03b2 -C\u03b1 interactions as well as the extra strength of the\n\u2032\u2032\npeptide term, k. For reasons of simplicity the strength of these interactions have been chosen of the same order as VCA\u2212CA\n=\n\u2032\u2032\n\u2032\u2032\nk = 1, VCA\u2212CB = VCB\u2212CB = 1/2. This choice was done for reasons of simplicity but is not particularly restrictive due to\nthe fact that effective interactions between sidechains are expected to be of the same order as C\u03b1 -C\u03b1 ones [38]; in addition the\nprecise value of k will mostly impact on the high frequency vibrational spectrum of the system. Hence, it can be anticipated that\nthe system elastic response should mostly depend on the value of the interaction radius, R, which has been accordingly varied\nin our analysis.\nWe first discuss the possibility to predict the temperature factors encountered in molecular dynamics. This type of validation\nhas been considered before by Doruker et al. in connection with the anisotropic gaussian model and reported a good consistency\nwith dynamical simulations [9].\nAs a measure of the agreement between the residues mean square fluctuations observed in MD and those predicted from the\nGaussian models, see eqn. (14), we considered the linear correlation coefficient. The degree of correlation as a function of the\ninteraction cutoff radius for \u03b2GM is shown in Fig. 2\nThe performance of the \u03b2GM particularly stable beyond an interaction cutoff of about 8.0 \u00c5. Given the large number of residues\nin the system (198 for the protein and 6 for the substrate) over which the B-factors are calculated, it is certainly possible\nto conclude that the correlation coefficient approaching 0.7 visible in Fig. 2 is statistically significant. A more quantitative\nassessment of the statistical significance could be done using the Student's t-test or related methods [37], although such analysis\nusually rely on the assumption that the joint distribution of the correlated variables is binormal (which is not necessarily satisfied\nfor B-factors). An alternative way is to recourse to the non-parametric Kendall test mentioned before [37], as recently proposed\nby Halle [36]. The Kendall correlation coefficient among the B-factors of the simulation and those of the \u03b2 Gaussian model (for\nR \u2248 7.5 \u00c5) is \u03c4 \u2248 0.61 and amply satisfies all ordinary criteria for statistical significance.\n\n\f7\n\nLinear correlation against MD B\u2212factors\n\n1\n0.9\n0.8\n0.7\n0.6\n0.5\n0.4\n0.3\n0.2\n0.1\n0\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\nCutoff\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\nFIG. 2: Linear correlation coefficient for the temperature factors of the 204 residues in the HIV-1 PR/SUB complex.\n\nThe successful comparison of the B-factors confirms the general agreement between the overall residues' motion in MD and\nthe equilibrium dynamics predicted by Gaussian models[9]; in fact, for the same cutoff used above ang agsinst the same MD\ndata of the HIV-1 PR/SUB complex, GNM provides a linear correlation coefficient of 0.61 while the Kendall parameter \u03c4 is\nequal to 0.59. However, the finer details of such accord have not, to the best of our knowledge, been explored yet and hence\nbecome the focus of our subsequent analysis which is based on a comparison of the MD and \u03b2GM covariance matrices. This test\nis particularly important due to the wealth of biological and chemical information that can been extracted from the covariance\n(essential dynamics) analysis [39, 40, 41].\nIn the context of HIV-1 Pr [13, 14, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49] these motions have a direct mechanical bearing on the\nstructural modulation of the active site, even though they are located remotely from it[11, 12, 15].\nAs a first case we consider the reduced covariance matrices. To allow a straightforward comparison of the theoretical and\nnumerical results rather than working directly in terms of the reduced covariance matrix, it is useful to focus on the normalised\nversion, which is dimensionless:\nh~xi * ~xj i\nC\u0303ij = p\nh|~xi |2 i h|~xj |2 i\n\n(17)\n\nThe scatter plot of Fig. 3 summarises the degree of accord between the normalised covariance matrix of the MD simulation and\nthat of the \u03b2-Gaussian model, for a cutoff 0f 7.5 \u00c5. The number of entries in the plot is about 2 * 104 , equal to the number of\ndistinct entries in the 204x204 C\u0303ij matrix. To avoid introducing artificial biases in the correlation, the diagonal elements of the\nnormalised matrices (which are all equal to 1) have been omitted from the plot.\nThe linear correlation coefficient among the two sets of data is 0.80 (and is stable in the neighborhood of R = 7.5 \u00c5). We\ndo not attempt to provide a quantitative measure for the statistical significance of the linear correlation in Fig. 3. In fact, on\none hand, as visible in Fig. 3, the joint distribution for covariance matrix elements is only approximately binormal, and hence\nthe traditional tests of linear regression significance are of dubious applicability. On the other, the Kendall correlation measure\nrequires to consider all possible pairs of points in the scatter plot: this makes the analysis impractical and disproportionate to the\nmain goal which is to ascertain the existence of the accord between topological gaussian models and MD results. In fact, rather\nthan measuring the correlation in absolute terms, we shall compare the accord of gaussian models and MD simulations against\nthe degree of \"internal\" consistency of the simulated dynamical trajectory itself.\nWe conclude the discussion of the scatter plot of Fig. 3 by mentioning that, in case of perfect correlation of two C\u0303ij sets, due\nto the normalization condition of eqn. 17, the data would align along the diagonal of the graph in Fig. 3. Interestingly, despite\nthe scatter visible in the same figure, the interpolating line lies very close to the diagonal, having a slope of s = 0.97 (taking the\n\u03b2GM covariance as the independent variable). This fact is useful in illustrating the effects of the cutoff, R, on the accord with\nMD covariance elements. While for R = 10\u00c5the slope is still good, s = 1.05, it deteriorates for R = 15\u00c5, where s = 1.64.\nThis effect is even more pronounced if the C\u03b2 's are not included in the model. For example, for R = 15 \u00c5 the observed slope\nwas s = 3.41.\nThe quantification of the self-consistency of MD dynamical trajectories is an extremely important issue since it can provide an\na posteriori indication of whether the dynamical sampling of the phase-space was sufficiently to obtain reliable thermodynamic\naverages. The analysis usually starts from the calculation of two covariance matrices pertaining to the first and second halves of\nthe MD trajectory.\n\n\f8\n\nFIG. 3: Scatter plot of corresponding entries of the covariance matrices obtained within the \u03b2 Gaussian model (R = 7.5 \u00c5) and from the 14ns\nMD simulation on the HIV-1 PR/SUB complex. The linear correlation coefficient over the 2 * 104 data points is 0.80 .\n\nThs two matrices could then be compared entry by entry, as done above. However, the most appropriate procedure is not\nto compare the corresponding matrix elements, but rather the physically-important (essential) eigenspaces, that is the linear\nspaces spanned by the eigenvectors of M \u22121 associated to the largest eigenvalues. A number of studies have suggested ways of\nmeasuring this consistency.\nThe first method of comparison that we will be taken into account is the one introduced by Amadei et al [50] which focuses\non the top n eigenvectors of the covariance matrices under comparison. These eigenvectors describe the most significant modes\nof vibration of the molecule in the three-dimensional space. We stress here that the covariance matrix considered here is not\nthe reduced one of eq. (16), whose size is N xN , but is the full one (the M \u22121 matrix) of size 3N x3N that contains the threedimensional information about correlated motion of pairs of residues, see e.g. eqn. (13).\nBy denoting the top n eigenvectors of the two matrices under comparison as {~\u03b7} and {~\u03bd }, the degree of overlap of the essential\nsubspaces is defined as the root mean square inner product (RMSIP) of all pairs of eigenvectors in the two sets [50]:\n\nRM SIP =\n\ns\n\n1X\n|~\u03b7i * ~\u03bdj |2\nn i,j\n\n(18)\n\nCustomarily, the analysis is restricted to the top n = 10 eigenvectors. We have measured the RMSIP in eqn. (18) when {\u03b7} and\n{\u03bd} come from the essential subspaces of the first and second halves of the 14ns MD trajectory of the HIV-1 PR/SUB complex.\nThe calculated RMSIP value, eq. 18, was 0.71. Amadei et al. [50] have also proposed a series of approximate tests to ascertain\nthe statistical relevance of the observed overlap. Based on their analysis, we can conclude that the value obtained here, for the\ngiven system size of 204 amino acids, has a probability to have arisen by chance that is, by far, inferior to the conventional\nthreshold of 1 %. This supports the fact that the MD trajectory was sufficiently long to contain significant physical information\nabout the system equilibrium dynamics.\nHaving in mind the level of internal consistency of the present reference MD trajectory we have turned to measuring the\nRMSIP between the essential spaces of the whole dynamical trajectory and those of the \u03b2 Gaussian model.\nThe resulting trend for the subspaces overlap is shown in Fig. 4 as a function of the interaction cutoff, R. The best performance\nof the model is obtained for a cutoff of R \u2248 7.5 \u00c5. The corresponding overlap value of 0.68 is very close to the internal overlap\nof the MD trajectory. We wish to remark that such values of RMSIP are highly non-trivial due to the large size of the full\ncovariance matrix (612x612). This implies that the probability to observe a given overlap, q, between two random unit vectors\ndecreases extremely rapidly as q approaches 1 [50]. As a consequence, the MD simulation time required to reach a given target\nvalue for the internal RMSIP consistency, q\u0304, grows very repidly with q\u0304.\nThis observation clarifies the utility of the Gaussian approach. With a modest computational investment, required by the\ndiagonalization of a 3N x3N matrix, one obtains a description of the protein essential dynamics that,within a molecular dynamics\nframework where all atom effective potentials are used, requires a considerably heavier computational investment. Further\nimprovements over the \u03b2GM performance are obviously possible within MD, but at the price of a rapidly growing computing\ntime.\nThe usefulness of the \u03b2GM is further supported by yet another type of analysis, which concludes the series of tests carried\nout here. This last approach follows a more precise measure for the agreement of the essential subspaces recently introduced\nby Hess [6]. The new measure is an improvement over the definition of eqn. (18) since it removes both the subjectivity of the\n\n\f9\n0.74\n0.72\n\nRMSIP\n\n0.7\n0.68\n0.66\n0.64\n0.62\n0.6\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\nCutoff (A)\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\nFIG. 4: Degree of correlation (root mean square inner product), see eqn.

The thick curve denotes the performance of the \u03b2 Gaussian model, while the horizontal\ndotted line indicates the overlap of the essential subspaces of the first and second halves of the MD trajectory.\n\nchoice of n, assigns more importance to the physically-relevant eigenspaces and deals correctly with the presence of spectral\ndegeneracies.\nUnlike the measure of Amadei et al., the one of Hess is sensitive to the actual values of the eigenvalues of M \u22121 . Since the\nenergy units of the gaussian models considered here has been chosen arbitrarily, a proper normalisation of the spectrum of the\ncovariance matrices has to be carried out in order to use the measure of Hess for the comparison against MD. For this reason,\nthe degree of overlap of the matrices was carried out after having uniformly rescaled the eigenvalues of M \u22121 so that the trace\nof M \u22121 was equal to 1 for both systems. Physically this corresponds to a normalization of the average residues mean square\ndisplacement.\nThe results for this analysis are shown in Fig. 5. The enhanced stringency of this test, which is extended to the whole\nvibrational spectrum, and not just to the top 10 modes, is reflected in an overall decrease of the overlap with respect to Fig. 4.\nThis finer measure also reflects better than RMSIP the higher degree os inner consistency of the MD trajectory, as opposed to\nthe MD-\u03b2GM accord. Although the best reference for our model would be provided by a simulation run sufficiently long that\nthe inner MD overlap approaches 1, this is not presently feasible due to the slow (approximately logarithmic) increase of the\ninner overlap with the length of the MD run. Despite this fact, the results fully confirm the previous conclusions namely that the\n\u03b2 Gaussian model can predict, with good statistical confidence, equilibrium dynamical properties of proteins and, in particular,\nidentify the relevant modes of vibration of the system.\nThe reference system used here for the comparison between the model and MD simulations was chosen for both its biological\n\n\f10\n\nFIG. 6: Scatter plot of corresponding entries of the covariance matrices obtained within the \u03b2 Gaussian model (R = 7.5 \u00c5) and from the 2.6ns\nMD simulation on the NGF-trkA complex [16]. The linear correlation coefficient over the nearly 105 data points is 0.86\n\nsignificance and for the availability of MD data collected over the rather long simulation time. The \u03b2 Gaussian model is,\nhowever, of general applicability, and to confirm the robustness of the strategy we have considered another biologically important\nreference system, the NGF-trkA complex. This is constituted by a protein dimer, the nerve growth factor (NGF), complexed with\nthe tyrosine kinase A receptor (trkA); altogether the system comprises 431 residues. The dynamics of the complex in aqueous\nsolution was recently simulated for a time span of 2.6 ns using all-atom potentials [16]. The resulting normalised covariance\nmatrix was compared with the one obtained from the \u03b2 Gaussian model. The linear correlation coefficient over the nearly 105\ncorresponding distinct entries of the matrices is 0.86, as visible in Fig. 6.\nThis result confirms the viability of the Gaussian approach to capture the details of the large-scale protein movements. However,\ndue to the simplicity of the model interaction potentials (all pairs of C\u03b1 's and C\u03b2 's interact with the same strength) one may\nforesee that the model is not suitable for modelling the vibrational dynamics of proteins where electrostatic effects or disulfide\nbonds play an important role for native stability or funtionality.\nBiological implications\nIn the MD calculations by Piana et al.[11, 12, 15] the essential dynamics analysis has allowed to identify the sites that, despite\nbeing spatially distant from the active site have a strong mechanical influence on the structural modulation of the regions binding\nthe substrate. We now compare the findings obtained with MD with those obtained with our model. The degree of mechanical\ncoupling observed in the MD trajectory between the substrate motion and the HIV-1 protease subunits is visible in the top panel\nof Fig. 7. The two curves in the plot represent the profile of the reduced covariance matrix, Cij , between the two central atoms\nof the peptide and the 198 protease residues. Interestingly, the regions that correlate significantly with the substrate motion are\nthose that have been indicated as rather under-constrained by studies where the theory of rigidity has been applied to characterize\nthe enzyme elasticity [51]. The two facts provide a consistent picture for the HIV-1 PR mechanics since any functionally-relevant\nmechanical coupling must intuitively involve mobile (and hence under-constrained) regions. The identification of the mobile\nregions of HIV-1 protease has also been previously addressed with Gaussian network models in a series of studies which also\nallowed to identify the residues important for protein stability [52, 53] or otherwise taking part to crucially important networks\nof key native contacts[54].\nThe bottom panel of figure 7 represents the corresponding correlation profiles calculated within the \u03b2GM for a cutoff R = 7.5\n\u00c5(which we take as an optimal value from previous analysis). The degree of agreement of the profiles across the two panels is\nremarkable and, the main difference appears to be due to an overemphasis of negative correlations in the gaussian profiles.\nIn both sets of data one observes a strong positive correlation between the substrate motion and the regions 24-30 and 45-55.\nThis direct mechanical coupling is of immediately interpreted due to the fact that the first region comprises the cleavage site\nwhile the second involves the tips of the protease flaps.\nThe essential-space analysis of the MD trajectory revealed that the two regions embrace the substrate and involve it in a\nrotational \"nutcracker-like\" motion. As a consequence of this rotation, the regions near the flaps elbows, 37-41 and 61-73,\nundergo a counter-movement that results in a negative correlation with the substrate motion. This effect is clearly visible in the\ngaussian profiles of Fig. 7, while it is less pronounced, but still significant, in the MD results.\nAs remarked in the Theory section, the intimate connection between the linear response theory and the covariance matrix\nallows to conclude that a force applied in correspondence of sites around residues 40 and 63 should affect the protease-substrate\ncoupling. This effect was indeed observed in the MD simulation where the motion of the substrate towards the cleavage site was\n\n\f11\n0.5\n\nMD\n\n0.3\n0.1\n\u22120.1\n\u22120.3\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n120\n\n140\n\n160\n\n180\n\n200\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\nsite\n\n120\n\n140\n\n160\n\n180\n\n200\n\nGaussian\n\n0.5\n0.3\n0.1\n\u22120.1\n\u22120.3\n\nFIG. 7: The two curves in each panel indicate the degree of correlation of the motion between the two central atoms of the substrate and the\n198 residues in the subunits of the HIV-1 protease. The top panel reports the MD findings, while the bottom one pertains to the \u03b2 Gaussian\nmodel.\n\nstrongly affected by the constraints on these regions (see Fig. 6 in ref. [11]).\nIt is by virtue of this mechanically-important coupling that it is possible to rationalize the emergence of mutations causing drug\nresistance in correspondence of sites far from the cleavage region (e.g. M63I, M46I-L and L47V). In fact, as the explicit MD\ncalculation has shown, the high degree of such coupling between such sites and the cleavage is such that the detailed chemical\nidentity of the former strongly influence the substrate binding affinity of the latter. In particular, the mutations observed in clinics\n[45, 46, 47, 48, 49] are arguably the result of a chemical fine-tuning that retains the native functionality of the enzyme while\ndecreasing its affinity for inhibiting drugs.\nThe details of how the enzymatic reaction kinetics changes upon amino acid mutations is beyond the reach of the topological\nmodels presented here. The gaussian scheme, in fact, is entirely adequate to identify which sites influence mechanically the\nactive site motion but, due to the fact that all amino acids (except for GLY which lacks the C\u03b2 centroid) are treated equally\nwe cannot explore the ramifications of changing the amino acid identity into the cleavage-region and substrate coupling. The\neffect of one of such mutations (M46I) on substrate motion has instead been fully taken into account in ref. [12]. Further\nimprovements of the \u03b2 Gaussian model may be possible by optimizing the distance of the C\u03b2 centroids from their respective\nC\u03b1 's (so to better capture the displacement of the sidechains centres of mass). The model could also be extended to include,\nat the simplest possible level, the effects of thermal denaturation through a self-consistent temperature-dependent weakening of\nthe strength of the harmonic couplings, as done in refs. [32, 55].\nIV.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nWe have examined the extent to which the dynamical properties of a protein in thermodynamic equilibrium can be accounted\nfor through solvable models. The starting proint of our analysis is the quadratic approximation of the free energy landscape\nin terms of the deviations of amino acids from their reference positions in the known native state. We have adopted a novel\ndescription of the amino acids which allows to consider the presence of effective C\u03b1 centroids whose degrees of freedom are\nentirely controlled by the C\u03b1 atoms. As a result, the model that is considered, is able to account for the directionality of amino\nacid sidechains while retaining the same degree of complexity as models based on C\u03b1 representation only. Various equilibrium\nquantities apt to characterize the most relevant modes of vibrations of proteins are considered. In particular, we focussed on\n(in increasing order of complexity and detail) the B-factors, the covariance matrices and the essential dynamical subspace. Our\nresults have been compared against the analogous quantities obtained through a 14ns molecular dynamics simulation carried out\non the HIV-1 PR enzyme in complex with a TIMMNR peptide substrate.\nAs fas as overall equilibrium dynamical properties are concerned, the \u03b2 Gaussian model provides a picture that is in remarkable\nagreement with the MD results. In fact, the essential subspace predicted theoretically appears to have a degree of consistency\nwith MD results that is close to the \"inner consistence\" of a 14ns MD simulation with itself.\nThis provides a strong indication that suitable quadratic models can provide a powerful and accurate tool for characterizing\nthe vibrational motions of proteins near their native state while requiring only a modest investment of computational resources.\nOther important properties of protein dynamics and functionality that strongly depend on the sequence composition or on out-ofequilibrium conditions are, at the moment, beyond the reach of such simplified approaches considered here. For this reason we\n\n\f12\nbelieve that the Gaussian approach would be ideally used in conjunction with molecular dynamics by providing, prior to investing\nsignificant computational resources in all-atom simulations, a fast but accurate characterization of a protein's near-native motion.\nV.
