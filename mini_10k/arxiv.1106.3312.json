We first confirm that it exhibits a\nself-accelerating solution, similar to what has been found in [2], where the\nHubble parameter corresponds to the graviton mass. For a certain range of\nparameters fluctuations relative to the self-accelerating background are stable\nand form an attractor solution. We also show that a degravitating solution\ncan not be constructed in this covariantized proxy theory in a meaningful\nway. As for cosmic structure formation, we find that the helicity-0 mode of\nthe graviton causes an enhancement relative to \u039bCDM. For consistency we\nalso compare proxy theories obtained starting from different frames in the\ndecoupling limit and discuss the possibility of obtaining a non-representative\nproxy theory by choosing the wrong starting frame.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nObservations of the CMB, supernovae, lensing and baryon acoustic oscillations have\nled to the cosmological standard model which requires an accelerated expansion of\nthe late Universe, driven by dark energy but despite many years of research its origin\nhas not yet been identified. There are two major explanations for the origin and\nproperties of dark energy.\nThe first solution consists of introducing a cosmological constant \u039b with a constant energy density causing an effective repulsive force between cosmological objects\nat large distances. From the particle physics perspective the cosmological constant\ncould correspond to the vacuum energy density. The theoretical expectations for\nthe vacuum energy density caused by fluctuating quantum fields, however, exceeds\nthe observational bounds on \u039b by up to 120 orders of magnitude. This discrepancy\n1\n2\n\nClaudia.deRham@unige.ch\nLavinia.Heisenberg@unige.ch\n\n1\n\n\fremains for more almost a century one of the most challenging puzzles in physics,\n[3].\nAlternatively, the acceleration of the Universe can be explained by introducing\nnew dynamical degrees of freedom, either by invoking new fluids T\u03bc\u03bd with negative\npressure or by changing the geometrical part of Einstein's equations. In particular,\nweakening gravity on cosmological scales could not only tackle the cosmological\nconstant problem, but would also come hand in hand with new degrees of freedom\nwhich might be responsible for a late-time speed-up of the Hubble expansion. Such\nscenarios could arise in massive gravity or in higher-dimensional frameworks.\nIn the higher dimensional picture, the Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati (DGP) model is\none of the important large scale modified theories of gravity [4]. In this braneworld\nmodel our Universe is confined to a three-brane embedded in a five-dimensional bulk.\nOn small scales, four-dimensional gravity is recovered due to an intrinsic Einstein\nHilbert term sourced by the brane curvature, whereas on larger, cosmological scales\ngravity is systematically weaker as the graviton acquires a soft mass m which limits\nits effective range. Being a fundamentally higher dimensional theory, the effective\nfour-dimensional graviton on the brane carries five degrees of freedom, namely the\nusual helicity-2 modes, two helicity-1 modes and one helicity-0 mode. Whilst the\nhelicity-1 mods typically decouple, the helicity-0 one can mediate an extra fifth\nforce. In the limit m \u2192 0, one recovers General Relativity (GR) through the\nVainshtein mechanism: The basic idea is to decouple the additional modes from\nthe gravitational dynamics via nonlinear interactions of the helicity-0 mode of the\ngraviton, [5]. As a result, at the vicinity of matter, the non-linear interaction for\nthe helicity-0 mode become large and hence suppresses its coupling to matter. This\ndecoupling of the nonlinear helicity-0 mode is manifest in the limit where M4 , M5 \u2192\n\u221e and m \u2192 0 while the strong coupling scale \u039b = (MPl m2 )1/3 is kept fixed. This\nlimit enables a linear treatment of the usual helicity-2 mode of gravity while the\nhelicity-0 mode \u03c0 is described non-linearly, which is the so-called decoupling limit.\nOne of the successes of the DGP model is the existence of a self-accelerating\nsolution, where the acceleration of the Universe is sourced by the graviton own\ndegrees of freedom (more precisely its helicity-0 mode). Unfortunately that branch\nof solution seems to be plagued by ghost-like instabilities [6, 7, 8], in the DGP model,\nbut this issue could be avoided in more sophisticated setups, for instance including\nGauss-Bonnet terms in the bulk [9].\nMore recently, it has been shown that the decoupling limit of DGP could be\nextended to more general Galilean invariant interactions [10]. This Galileon model\nrelies strongly on the symmetry of the helicity-0 mode \u03c0: Invariance under internal\nGalilean and shift transformations, which in induced gravity braneworld models can\nbe regarded as residuals of the 5-dimensional Poincar\u00e9 invariance. These symmetries\nand the postulate of ghost-absence restrict the construction of the effective \u03c0 Lagrangian. There exist only five derivative interactions which fulfill these conditions.\nFrom the five dimensional point of view these Galilean invariant interactions are\nconsequences of Lovelock invariants in the bulk of generalized braneworld models,\n2\n\n\f[11]. Since their inception there has been a flurry of investigations related to selfaccelerating de Sitter solutions without ghosts [10, 12], Galileon cosmology and its\nobservations [13, 14], inflation [15, 16, 17, 18], lensing [19], superluminalities arising\nin spherically symmetric solutions around compact sources [20], K-mouflage [21],\nKinetic Gravity Braiding [22], etc... . Furthermore, there has been some effort in\ngeneralizing the Galileon to a non-flat background. The first attempt was then to\ncovariantize directly the decoupling limit and to study its resulting cosmology [13].\nIn particular it was shown in [23] that the naive covariantization would yield ghostlike terms at the level of equation of motion but a given unique nonminimal coupling\nbetween \u03c0 and the curvature can remove these terms resulting in second order of\nequations of motion [23], which are also consistent with a higher-dimensional construction [11]. In this paper, we will pursue the same strategy when constructing\nour proxy theory. The outcome of this kind of covariantization method was explored\nfurther in [24]. While this covariantization is ghost-free, the Galileon symmetry is\nbroken explicitly in curved backgrounds. Only recently there has been a successful generalization to the (Anti-) de Sitter background and ultimately to maximally\nsymmetric backgrounds where it has been discovered that the de Sitter Galileon interactions acquire additional, potential-like terms being functions of \u03c0 and mixtures\nof \u03c0 and gradients of \u03c0, all fulfilling a generalized Galileon symmetry [25].\nThere exists a parallel to theories centered on a massive graviton: Galileon-type\ninteraction terms naturally arise in gravitational theories using a massive spin-2\nparticle as an exchange particle, which has, in addition, been constructed to be\nghost-free be it in three dimensions, [26] or for an generalized Fierz-Pauli action in\nfour dimensions [1, 27]3 . Not only is the existence of a graviton mass a fundamental\nquestion from a theoretical perspective, it could also have important consequences\nboth in cosmology and in solar system physics, [32, 33]. Although solar system observations have confirmed GR to high accuracy and placed bounds on the graviton\nmass to be smaller than a few \u223c 10\u221232 eV, even such a small mass would become relevant at the Hubble scale which corresponds to the graviton Compton wavelength.\nIn particular, it has been successfully shown that this massive gravity theory exhibits a stable self-accelerated solution in the decoupling limit since the scalar mode\ncan generate a constant negative pressure density. In the decoupling limit, the\nexpansion history of the Universe in this self-accelerating branch was found to be\nindistinguishable from \u039bCDM, [2].\nWhile the self-accelerating solutions in the above models yield viable expansion\nhistories including late-time acceleration, they do not address the cosmological constant problem, i.e. the giant mismatch between the theoretically computed high\nenergy density of the vacuum and the low observed value. A possible answer comes\nfrom the idea of degravitation, which asserts that the energy density could be as\nlarge as the theoretically expected value, but would not bear a large effect on the\n3\n\nSuch a theory was also constructed using auxiliary extra dimensions, [28, 29]. While in its\nmost fundamental form, a ghost appears at quartic order in the decoupling limit, [30], it can also\nbe cured order by order, [31].\n\n3\n\n\fgeometry. Technically, gravity is less strong on large scales (IR-limit) and could act\nas a high-pass filter suppressing the gravitational effect of a potentially large vacuum energy. Since such modifications of gravity in the IR naturally arise in models\nof massive gravity, they logically provide a possible mechanism to degravitate the\nvacuum energy density, [34, 35, 36], which was observed in bi-Galileon models [37]\nas well as in the decoupling limit of massive gravity, [2]. Analogously, the DGP\nbraneworld model can be extended to higher dimensions to tackle the cosmological\nconstant problem as well, [36, 38, 39].\nIn this paper, we focus on the covariantization of a ghost-less extension of FierzPauli massive gravity recently proposed in [27] and show that this proxy model\nallows for a stable self-accelerating solution. Hereby, we have performed the covariantization in the Jordan as well as in the Einstein frame. We discuss the differences\nbetween the two approaches and the consequences of choosing the wrong starting\nframe. In the well defined proxy theory we are able to tackle the puzzle about\nthe self-acceleration of the Universe but not the one about the cosmological constant problem. Furthermore, we study the perturbations around the self-accelerating\nbackground and provide the expression for the modified evolution equation for these\ndensity perturbations. As expected, the \u03c0 field enhances the gravitational clustering\nresulting in a rapid growth of structures. This result is quite different from the one\nwe had obtained in [2], where the self-accelerating solution was indistinguishable\nfrom a \u039bCDM, but we emphasize that the theory used in this paper, is a proxy\nmodel distinct from massive gravity. At early times, the enhancement of clustering\nis restrained since the Galileon self-interactions are the dominant ones suppressing\ntheir energy density relative to that of matter or radiation. Once the matter density\nhas dropped sufficiently, the Galileon become an important contribution to the dark\nsector of the Universe driving cosmic expansion.\nThe paper is organized as follows: We start in section 2 with a summary of the\nnon-linear theory of massive gravity [27] which we use for constructing our proxy\ntheory, where we discuss the successful implementation of ghost-free massive gravity\nin the decoupling limit. We then move to our proxy theory in section 3 where we\nfirst give some motivations on why we use a proxy theory rather than the exact\nnon-linear theory. We then work out the consequences of this covariantization for\ncosmology and specifically for late-time acceleration in section 4 where we study\nalso the stability conditions and the reason why a degravitating solution can not be\nconstructed in our covariantized theory. We then move onto more general cosmology\nin section 5 and follow the helicity-0 mode contribution to the Universe throughout\nits evolution, before quickly presenting the consequences for structure formation in\nsection 6.\n\n4\n\n\f2\n\nMassive Gravity and its decoupling limit\n\nWe use the same notation as [10], with (\u2202\u03c0)2 = g \u03bc\u03bd \u2202\u03bc \u03c0\u2202\u03bd \u03c0, \u03a0\u03bc\u03bd = D\u03bc D\u03bd \u03c0 and\n\u03a02\u03bc\u03bd = g \u03b1\u03b2 \u03a0\u03bc\u03b1 \u03a0\u03b2\u03bd where the covariant derivative is taken w.r.t. g\u03bc\u03bd and square\nbrackets [...] represent the trace of a tensor [\u03a02 ] = \u03a0\u03bc\u03bd \u03a0\u03bc\u03bd and [\u03a0]2 = \u03a0\u03bc\u03bc \u03a0\u03bd\u03bd .\n\n2.1\n\nMassive Gravity\n\nThe first theory of massive gravity was proposed by Fierz and Pauli in 1939 [40], but\nwas shown to be unstable by Boulware-Deser (BD) [41], due to the non-propagation\nof the Hamiltonian constraint at the non-linear level. This instability can also be\nseen in the St\u00fcckelberg language [42] where in the decoupling limit, the helicity-0\nmode typically has equations of motion with more than two derivatives, and hence\ndoes not possess a well defined Cauchy surface. However it was shown in [27, 1]\nthat the graviton potential could be built in such way as to remove any higher\nderivative term in the equations of motion, and obtain a Galileon-type of action for\nthe additional helicity-0 mode. To review this, let us start with a graviton of mass\nm described by\n\u0013\n\u0012\n2 \u221a\nMPl\nm2\nU(g, H)\n(1)\nL=\n\u2212g R \u2212\n2\n4\nwith the potential U, where the tensor H\u03bc\u03bd is constructed in terms of the metric\ng\u03bc\u03bd and the four St\u00fcckelberg fields \u03a6a by H\u03bc\u03bd = g\u03bc\u03bd \u2212 \u03b7ab \u2202\u03bc \u03a6a \u2202\u03bd \u03a6b . We can then\nsplit the St\u00fcckelberg fields into helicity-1 and -0 contributions, but the helicity-1\nmode decouples in the decoupling limit and can be consistently set to zero. We\ntherefore focus on the helicity-0 mode \u03c0 and write \u03a6a = (xa \u2212 \u03b7 a\u03bc \u2202\u03bc \u03c0) \u221a\nsuch that\n\u03b1\u03b2\n\u03bc\n\u03bc\nH\u03bc\u03bd = h\u03bc\u03bd + 2\u03a0\u03bc\u03bd \u2212 \u03b7 \u03a0\u03bc\u03b1 \u03a0\u03b2\u03bd . Defining the quantity K\u03bd (g, H) = \u03b4\u03bd \u2212 \u03b4\u03bd\u03bc \u2212 H\u03bd\u03bc\nthe most generic potential that bears no ghosts in the decoupling limit is\nU(g, H) = \u22124 (U2 + \u03b13 U3 + \u03b14 U4 )\n\n(2)\n\nwhere \u03b13,4 are two free parameters and\nU2 = [K]2 \u2212 [K2 ]\nU3 = [K]3 \u2212 3[K][K2 ] + 2[K3 ]\nU4 = [K]4 \u2212 6[K2 ][K]2 + 8[K3 ][K] + 3[K2 ]2 \u2212 6[K4 ] .\n\n(3)\n(4)\n(5)\n\nNotice that U4 can be expressed in terms of U2,3 and the tadpole U1 = [K], [43].\nIt has then been shown that ghost-like pathologies in this theory of massive gravity theory disappear to all orders in the decoupling limit and at least up to quartic\norder beyond the decoupling limit, as well as completely non-linearly in some specific cases. While this theory is completely covariant, studying the cosmology as\nwell as other non-trivial curved geometries can be extremely complicated. Instead,\n5\n\n\fwe will here focus on its version in the decoupling limit and covariantize the theory\ndirectly from this limit. We emphasize that the resulting proxy theory will be distinct from the theory of massive gravity presented above, but presents nevertheless\nsome interesting features for cosmology.\nIn the decoupling limit, taking the scales MPl \u2192 \u221e and m \u2192 0, while keeping\nthe strong coupling scale \u039b3 = MPl m2 fixed, the above Lagrangian (1) reduces to\nthe more compact expression\na2\na3\n1 \u03bc\u03bd\n1\n\u03b1\u03b2\n(1)\n(2)\n(3)\nh\u03b1\u03b2 + h\u03bc\u03bd X\u03bc\u03bd\n+ 3 h\u03bc\u03bd X\u03bc\u03bd\n+ 6 h\u03bc\u03bd X\u03bc\u03bd\n+\nh T\u03bc\u03bd\nL = \u2212 h\u03bc\u03bd E\u03bc\u03bd\n2\n\u039b\n\u039b\n2MPl\n\n(6)\n\n\u03b1\u03b2\nwhere h\u03bc\u03bd stands for the helicity-2 mode canonically normalized, E\u03bc\u03bd\nis the Lichnerowicz operator, the coefficients a2,3 are related to the free parameters \u03b13,4 and\n(1,2,3)\nX\u03bc\u03bd\ndenote the interactions with the helicity-0 mode [27]\n(1)\nX\u03bc\u03bd\n= \u0003\u03c0g\u03bc\u03bd \u2212 \u03a0\u03bc\u03bd\n\n(7)\n\n1\n(2)\nX\u03bc\u03bd\n= \u03a02\u03bc\u03bd \u2212 \u0003\u03c0\u03a0\u03bc\u03bd \u2212 ([\u03a02 ] \u2212 [\u03a0]2 )g\u03bc\u03bd\n(8)\n2\n(3)\nX\u03bc\u03bd\n= 6\u03a03\u03bc\u03bd \u2212 6[\u03a0]\u03a02\u03bc\u03bd + 3([\u03a0]2 \u2212 [\u03a02 ])\u03a0\u03bc\u03bd \u2212 g\u03bc\u03bd ([\u03a0]3 \u2212 3[\u03a02 ][\u03a0] + 2[\u03a03 ]) .(9)\nIt is worth to mention that these interaction terms are all transverse and at most\nsecond order in time derivatives to ensure the absence of ghost. Being ghost-free,\nthese interactions are closely related to the Galileon interactions and fulfill the same\ninternal symmetry. In the next section we will covariantize these interaction terms\n(1,2,3)\nand discuss their physical properties.\nh\u03bc\u03bd X\u03bc\u03bd\nIn the case of external sources there is a coupling between the metric h\u03bc\u03bd and the\nstress energy tensor via h\u03bc\u03bd T \u03bc\u03bd but there is not such a direct coupling with the field\n(1)\n\u03c0.

Furthermore, the fact that G00 , G0i , L0i0j and\nL0ikj have at most one time-derivative guarantees the propagation of constraints.\nSince we are not in the Einstein frame, these stress-energy tensor are only transverse on-shell, and satisfy the relation, D\u03bc T\u03bd\u03bc = \u2202\u03bd \u03c0E\u03c0 where E\u03c0 is the equation of\nmotion with respect to \u03c0.

In the rest of this paper, we study the resulting cosmology in this proxy theory, starting with the existence of self-accelerating\nsolutions.\n\n4\n\nde Sitter solutions\n\nIn what follows, we focus on the cosmology of the covariantized theory (10, 11), and\nfocus for that on a FRW background with scale factor a(t) and Hubble parameter\nH.

Furthermore, we assume that we are\nin a regime where H\u03c0 \u226a \u03c0\u0307 so that we can neglect terms proportional to \u03c0 and\nconsider only the terms including \u03c0\u0307 or \u03c0\u0308.

Similar to what has been found in [2] our proxy theory admits a selfaccelerated solution, with the Hubble parameter set by the graviton mass. For the\nstability condition of this self-accelerating solution the first constraint we have is\nto demand H > 0. The other constrain comes from the stability condition for\nperturbations on the background which we discuss in the following subsection.\n\n4.2\n\nStability conditions\n\nIn the last subsection we have shown explicitly that our proxy theory exhibits a\nself-accelerating solution with H 2 \u2248 m2 . Now, we would like to study whether the\nperturbations on this background are stable and what the constraints are. For this\npurpose, consider perturbations on the background solution of the following form\n\u03c0 = \u03c00 (t) + \u03b4\u03c0(t, x, y, z)\n\n(29)\n\nThe second order action for the perturbations is\nL=\u2212\n\na2\na3\n(0) \u03bc\u03b1\u03bd\u03b2 2a3\n\u03bc\u03bd\n\u2202\n\u03b4\u03c0\u2202\n\u03b4\u03c0G\n\u2212\n\u2202\n\u03b4\u03c0\u2202\n\u03b4\u03c0\u03a0\n\u2212 6 \u2202\u03bc \u03c00 \u2202\u03bd \u03b4\u03c0D\u03b1 D\u03b2 \u03b4\u03c0L\u03bc\u03b1\u03bd\u03b2 , (30)\n\u03bc\n\u03bd\n\u03bc\n\u03bd\n\u03b1\u03b2 L\n3\n6\n\u039b\n\u039b\n\u039b\n\nwhich can be written in the form\nL = Ktt (\u03b4 \u03c0\u0307 2 \u2212\nwhere\n\n3MPl a3 H 2\nKtt = \u2212\n\u039b3\n\nand\nc2s\n\n1\n=\n3\n\n\u0012\n\nc2s\n(\u2207\u03b4\u03c0)2 )\na2\n\n(31)\n\n\u0012\n\u0013\n6a3 H\na2 +\n\u03c0\u0307\n\u039b3\n\n(32)\n\na2 \u039b3\n2+\na2 \u039b3 + 6a3 H \u03c0\u0307\n\n\u0013\n\n.\n\n(33)\n\nThe condition for the stability is then given by Ktt > 0, c2s > 0 and H 2 > 0, which\nare fulfilled if\n1\n(34)\na2 > 0\nand\n0 > a3 > \u2212 a22 .\n8\nTo compare this result with the condition obtained in the decoupling limit, [2], we\nfirst mention that ahere\n= \u22122athere\nand ahere\n= athere\n. In terms of the parameters\n2\n2\n3\n3\n2\nused there, we need to compare our conditions ahere\n<\n0, ahere\n> \u2212 81 (ahere\n2\n3\n2 ) to the\n)2 < athere\n< \u2212 21 (athere\n)2 . We see that our theory\nconditions athere\n< 0 and \u2212 23 (athere\n2\n3\n2\n2\nis less constraining but is still within the parameter space derived in [2]. It is not\n9\n\n\fsurprising that the stability condition in the decoupling limit and in our covariantized\ntheory do not coincide totally as we have explicitly broken the symmetry when\ngetting the proxy and in particular, our solution does now spontaneously break\nLorentz invariance, which was not the case in the decoupling limit, [2].\nIt is also worth pointing out that the self-accelerating solution by itself does not\npropagate any superluminal mode, since 2/3 < c2s < 1.\nWe emphasize as well that the constant \u03c0\u0307 solution is a dynamical attractor. For\nthis we just consider time dependent perturbations \u03c0(t) = \u03c00 (t) + \u03b4\u03c0(t) which is a\nspecial case of (29) fulfilling the same stability conditions. The equation of motion\nfor perturbations simplifies to\n\u2202t (a3 \u03b4 \u03c0\u0307) = 0\n(35)\nThe solution for \u03b4 \u03c0\u0307 is given by\n\u03b4 \u03c0\u0307(t) \u223c a\u22123 .\n\n(36)\n\nThus, these perturbations \u03b4\u03c0(t) redshift away exponentially compared to the \u03c0\u0307 =\nconst self-accelerating solution. Therefore, the self-accelerating solution is an attractor.\n\n4.3\n\nDegravitation\n\nMore interestingly, one can wonder whether degravitation can be exhibited in these\nclass of solutions. If one take \u03c0 = \u03c0(t) and H = 0, it is straightforward to see that we\nobtain \u03c1\u03c0 = 0, so the field has absolutely no effect and cannot help the background\nto degravitate. The situation is however different when setting \u03c0 = \u03c70 x\u03b1 x\u03b1 , which\nwas possible in the decoupling limit. In this proxy theory, such a behaviour will\ninvolve explicit space dependances in the equations of motion which should be dealt\nwith specifically.\nInterestingly, the interactions considered here are precisely of the same form as\nthat studied recently in [46]. There as well, in the absence of spatial curvature \u03ba = 0,\nthe contribution from the scalar field vanishes if H = 0. Comparing with [46], we\ncan hence wonder whether the addition of spatial curvature \u03ba 6= 0 in our proxy\ntheory could help achieving degravitation, but relying strongly on spatial curvature\nbrings concerns over instabilities which are beyond the scope of this study.\n\n5\n\nCosmology\n\nIn the following we would like to discuss in more detail the interplay of all the\nconstituents of the universe. We assume that matter, radiation and the scalar field\n\u03c0 contribute to the total energy density of the universe.\nH2 =\n\n8\u03c0G \u03c0\n(\u03c1 + \u03c1rad + \u03c1mat )\n3\n10\n\n(37)\n\n\fConsider the scalar field \u03c0 as a perfect fluid with the effective energy density and\npressure given by (21, 22). Thus, the equation of state parameter of this new field\nwould be\n\u03c9\u03c0 =\n\n\u221212a3 H 3 \u03c0\u0307 3 + 2\u039b3 \u1e22(2\u039b3\u03c0 \u2212 a2 \u03c0\u0307 2 ) + 2\u039b6 \u03c0\u0308 + 4H \u03c0\u0307(\u039b6 \u2212 3a3 \u1e22 \u03c0\u0307 2 \u2212 a2 \u039b3 \u03c0\u0308)\n3H(2\u039b6 \u03c0\u0307 \u2212 10a3 H 2 \u03c0\u0307 3 + H(2\u039b6\u03c0 \u2212 3a2 \u039b3 \u03c0\u0307 2 ))\n3H 2 (2\u039b6 \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0\u0307 2 (a2 \u039b3 + 6a3 \u03c0\u0308))\n.\n(38)\n+\n3H(2\u039b6\u03c0\u0307 \u2212 10a3 H 2 \u03c0\u0307 3 + H(2\u039b6 \u03c0 \u2212 3a2 \u039b3 \u03c0\u0307 2 ))\n\nAt this point one should mention that the energy density for the \u03c0-field is not\nconserved but rather given by D\u03bc T\u03bd\u03bc = \u2202\u03bd \u03c0E\u03c0 (where E\u03c0 is the equation of motion\nfor \u03c0), which is not surprising since \u03c0 is non-minimally coupled to gravity in the\nJordan frame. Therefore, we can have \u03c9\u03c0 < \u2212 1.\nIn the following we will first assume that at early times in the evolution history of\nthe Universe we can neglect the extra density coming from the helicity-0 \u03c1\u03c0 .

Consider perturbations of \u03c0 around its cosmological\nbackground solution \u03c0(x, t) = \u03c00 (t) + \u03c6(x, t). \u03c6 gives a contribution to the Newtonian potential of the form \u03c8 = \u03c6/MPl . In the Newtonian approximation we have\n|\u03c6\u0307| \u226a |\u2207\u03c6|.

We have also ignored terms of the form \u03b4R(\u2202\u03c00 )2 /\u039b3 , which\ncould a priori be relevant, but their inclusion would require solving the full Einstein\nequation, which is beyond the scope of this study. As a first approximation, such\nterms are hence ignored.\nThe perturbations for the source is just given by \u03b4T = \u2212\u03c1m \u03b4m for non-relativistic\nsources, thus we have\n\u22072 \u03c6\n\u03c1m \u03b4m\n=\n(47)\n2\na\n3MPl Q\nwhere Q stands for\n2a2\n(48)\nQ \u2261 1 \u2212 3 (2H \u03c0\u03070 + \u03c0\u03080 + MPl (2\u1e22 + 3H 2 ))\n\u0012\u039b\n\u0013\na3\n16MPl\n\u2212 6 5H 2 \u03c0\u030702 + 2\u1e22 \u1e57i20 + 4H \u03c0\u03080 \u03c0\u03070 \u2212\n(2H 3 \u03c0\u03070 + 2H \u1e22 \u03c0\u03070 + H 2 \u03c0\u03080 ) .\n\u039b\n3\nFinally, the modified evolution equation for density perturbations is\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1\n\u03c1m \u03b4m\n.\n1+\n\u03b4\u0308m + 2H \u03b4\u0307m =\n2\nMPl\n3Q\n\n(49)\n\nKnowing the background configuration it is then relatively straightforward to derive\nthe effect on structure formation. We recover the usual result that when the field is\nscreened, H \u03c0\u0307 & \u039b3 , the extra force coming from the helicity-0 is negligible and the\nformation of structure is similar as in \u039bCDM.\n\n7\n\nCovariantization from the Einstein Frame\n\nAfter having studied the cosmology and the structure formation of our proxy theory\nin the Jordan frame, the natural question is whether we would expect similar results\nin a different frame. Instead of covariantizing our Lagrangian in the Jordan frame,\nit is on an equal footing to go to the Einstein frame where the Ricci scalar is not\nmultiplied by the scalar field \u03c0 and covariantize the theory at that stage. Since it is\nunclear at first sight which frame is the physical frame we will consider both frames\nand discuss their differences. Our starting Lagrangian was\n1\na2\na3\n1 \u03bc\u03bd\n\u03b1\u03b2\n(1)\n(2)\n(3)\nh T\u03bc\u03bd\nL = \u2212 h\u03bc\u03bd E\u03bc\u03bd\nh\u03b1\u03b2 + h\u03bc\u03bd X\u03bc\u03bd\n+ 3 h\u03bc\u03bd X\u03bc\u03bd\n+ 6 h\u03bc\u03bd X\u03bc\u03bd\n+\n2\n\u039b\n\u039b\n2MPl\n13\n\n(50)\n\n\fNow, when we do the following change of variables\nh\u03bc\u03bd = h\u0304\u03bc\u03bd + \u03c0\u03b7\u03bc\u03bd\n\n(51)\n\n(1)\n\nwe can diagonalize the first mixed term h\u03bc\u03bd X\u03bc\u03bd such that the Lagrangian takes the\nfollowing form\n1\n3\na2\n3 a2\n\u03b1\u03b2\n(2)\nL = \u2212 h\u0304\u03bc\u03bd E\u03bc\u03bd\nh\u0304\u03b1\u03b2 + \u03c0\u0003\u03c0 + 3 h\u0304\u03bc\u03bd X\u03bc\u03bd\n\u2212\n\u0003\u03c0(\u2202\u03c0)2\n2\n2\n\u039b\n2 \u039b3\na3\n1\na3\n(3)\n(h\u0304\u03bc\u03bd + \u03c0\u03b7\u03bc\u03bd )T \u03bc\u03bd\n\u2212 2 6 (\u2202\u03c0)2 ([\u03a02 ] \u2212 \u0003\u03c0 2 ) +\n+ 6 h\u0304\u03bc\u03bd X\u03bc\u03bd\n\u039b\n\u039b\n2MPl\n\n(52)\n\nCovariantizing this action is straightforward. We use again the correspondences in\n(3.1) and it has been shown explicitly that the covariant equivalence to \u0003\u03c0(\u2202\u03c0)2\nand \u22122(\u2202\u03c0)2 ([\u03a02 ] \u2212 \u0003\u03c0 2 ) are given by \u0003\u03c0(\u2202\u03c0)2 and 2(\u2202\u03c0)2 (\u0003\u03c0 2 \u2212 [\u03a02 ] \u2212 41 (\u2202\u03c0)2 R)\nrespectively, which do not yield any ghostlike instabilities ([23], [11]). Thus, the\ncovariantized action in the Einstein frame is simply given by\na2 MPl\n3 a2\n3\n2\n\u2202\u03bc \u03c0\u2202\u03bd \u03c0G\u03bc\u03bd \u2212\n\u0003\u03c0(\u2202\u03c0)2\nL = MPl\nR + \u03c0\u0003\u03c0 \u2212\n3\n3\n2\n\u039b\n2\u039b\na3 MPl\na3\n1\n\u03bc\u03b1\u03bd\u03b2\n2\n\u2212\n\u2202\u03bc \u03c0\u2202\u03bd \u03c0\u03a0\u03b1\u03b2 L\n+ 2 6 (\u2202\u03c0) (\u0003\u03c0 2 \u2212 [\u03a02 ] \u2212 (\u2202\u03c0)2 R)\n6\n\u039b\n\u039b\n4\n+Lm (\u03c8, (1 + \u03c0)g\u03bc\u03bd )\n\n(53)\n\nSimilarly as before, the properties of G\u03bc\u03bd and L\u03bc\u03b1\u03bd\u03b2 ensure that their equations of\nmotion lead at most to second order derivative terms. To find a self-accelerating\nsolution we set again a pure de Sitter metric, with \u03c0\u0307 = q\u039b3 /H. The Friedmann and\nthe field equations then take the form\n1 \u039b6 2\n\u039b6 3\n\u039b6 4\nq\n+\n3a\nq\n+\n15a\nq\n2\n3\n2 H2\nH2\nH2\n\u039b3 (\u22121 + 3q(a2 + 4a3 q)) + 2MPl (a2 + 3a3 q)H 2 = 0\n(54)\n2\nMPl\nH 2 = 3MPl a2 \u039b3 q 2 + 10MPl a3 \u039b3 q 3 \u2212\n\nWhen comparing the above Friedmann and the field equations with the one we had\nin the Jordan frame (26), we see significant differences coming from the extra terms\nwhich were not there in the Jordan frame. These terms yield Friedmann and field\nequations proportional to q 4 and H 4 which are more difficult to solve.\nFor fairness, we should compare both actions in the same frame. We do so by\nperforming a conformal transformation on the action (11):\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u03c0\n2\n2\ng\u0303\u03bc\u03bd = \u03a9 g\u03bc\u03bd\nwith\n\u03a9 = 1\u2212\n.\n(55)\nMPl\nFor simplicity we consider the case for which a3 = 0, so under this conformal transformation the covariantized action (11) becomes\n\u0012\n\u0013\n3 \u22124  \u0303 2 a2 MPl  \u0303\u03bc  \u0303\u03bd\n5 \u03a9\u22124  \u0303 4\n3 \u03a9\u22122  \u0303 2  \u0303\n2\nLJ = MPl R\u0303 \u2212 \u03a9 (\u2202\u03c0) \u2212\n(\u2202\u03c0) \u0003\u03c0 +\n\u2202 \u03c0 \u2202 \u03c0 G\u0303\u03bc\u03bd +\n(\u2202\u03c0) (56)\n2\n2\n\u039b3\n2 MPl\n4 MPl\n14\n\n\fIn the limit where \u03c0 \u226a MPl we have then finally the following expression\n3\na2 MPl\n3 a2\n2\nLJ = MPl\nR + \u03c0\u0003\u03c0 \u2212\n\u2202\u03bc \u03c0\u2202\u03bd \u03c0G\u03bc\u03bd \u2212\n\u0003\u03c0(\u2202\u03c0)2 ,\n3\n3\n2\n\u039b\n2\u039b\n\n(57)\n\nwhich coincides with the theory obtained from the Einstein frame, (53) with a3 = 0.\nSo within the regime of validity of our results, our conclusions are independent of the\nchoice of frame. However beyond this regime the theory originally constructed from\nthe Jordan frame could violate the null energy condition from the term proportional\nto (\u2202\u03c0)4 .\n\n8\n\nDiscussion\n\nCommon to generic massive gravity models is the presence of at least one additional helicity-0 degree of freedom which originates from a spin-two graviton field.\nIn contrast to an arbitrary scalar field, its dynamics is not driven by a potential but\nrather by specific derivative terms fixed by symmetries. Such a degree of freedom\nis experimentally testable. On solar system and galactic scales gravity is very well\ncompatible with GR and correctional terms from a modified gravity model are excluded. On these scales, however, the effects of massive gravity might be cloaked\nby the Vainshtein mechanism, where the helicity-0 mode interactions become appreciable to freeze out the field fluctuations. A number of screening mechanisms have\nbeen devised such as the chameleon and symmetron mechanisms. Contrary to those\nthe success of the Vainshtein mechanism does not rely on some specific potential\nbut instead on derivative interactions, which cause the helicity-0 mode to become\ndecoupled from matter and light on short distances, which nevertheless could have\nobservational signatures on larger scales in cosmic structure formation.\nA further benefit of the Vainshtein mechanism would be a natural solution to\nthe problem that the matter density and the cosmological constant are of similar\nmagnitudes today. The cosmological application of the Vainshtein mechanism works\nsuch that at early times, the galileon interactions are dominated by self-interaction,\nwhich suppresses their energy density relative to that of matter or radiation. If the\nmatter density has decreased sufficiently by cosmic expansion, the galileon constitutes an important contribution to the energy density of the universe and drives\ncosmic expansion.\nAlthough the precise cosmology of the theory of massive gravity proposed in\n[1] has not been derived, most models of massive gravity give rise to alterations of\nthe Hubble function similar to DGP-gravity. Experimental tests of the expansion\ndynamics of the Universe include the distance-redshift relation of supernovae, and\nmeasurements of the angular diameter distance as a function of redshift, as in the\ncase of the cosmic microwave background and the baryon acoustic oscillations. Apart\nfrom these geometrical tests, the time-dependence of evolving cosmic structures\ncan be investigated, and the influence of the gravitational theory on the geodesics\n15\n\n\fof relativistic (photons) and nonrelativistic (dark matter) test particles. The first\ncategory includes gravitational lensing and the Sachs-Wolfe effects, which have been\nshown to differ from their GR-expectation in some modified gravity theories, and\na similar result can be expected in massive gravity. The second category includes\nthe homogeneous growth of the cosmic structure, and the formation of galaxies and\nclusters of galaxies by gravitational collapse. Again, massive gravity would influence\nthe time sequence of gravitational clustering and the evolution of peculiar velocities,\nas well as the number density of collapsed objects. In particular, massive gravity\nwould enhance gravitational clustering since they tend to lower the collapse threshold\nfor density fluctuations in the large-scale structure, leading to a higher comoving\nnumber density of galaxies and clusters of galaxies. Naturally, these changes are\ndegenerate with a different choice of cosmological parameters and with introducing\nnon-Gaussian initial conditions, which would be very interesting to quantify. Recent\ndiscrepancies of \u039bCDM with observational data on large scales include the number of\nvery massive clusters, the strong lensing cross section, anomalous multipole moments\nof the CMB, the axis of evil, and large peculiar velocities. It is beyond the scope\nof this paper to address these issues using massive gravity, but we propose how\nto proceed from constructing a massive gravity theory to providing observationally\ntestable quantities. From our point of view it is advisable to focus on probes of large\nscales, due to difficulties related to nonlinear structure formation and the influence\nof baryons on small scales. Natural questions concern the homogeneous dynamics of\nthe Universe, the formation of structures and the shape of geodesics of relativistic\nand nonrelativistic particles. Basically, using our proxy theory one should be able\nto make predictions concerning these four issues and the combination of the four\nshould give insight into the nature of the gravitational sector. In our proxy theory,\nfrom the modified field equation the Hubble-function can be derived easily, which\nallows the definition of distance measures, needed in the interpretation of supernova\ndata. Cosmic structure growth tests the Newtonian limit for slowly-moving particles\nand describes the clustering of galaxies and the growth of structures which are\ninvestigated by e.g. gravitational light deflection. Lensing, in turn, makes use of\nthe geodesic equation for relativistic particles, and measures the correlation function\nof the matter density, weighted with the lensing efficiency function, which in turn\nis derived from distance measures. It would be quite interesting to study these\nobservational consequences and constraints of our proxy theory in a future work.\n\nAcknowledgments\nWe would like to thank Clare Burrage, Paul de Fromont, Gregory Gabadadze, Parvin\nMoyassari and Andrew Tolley for useful discussion.
