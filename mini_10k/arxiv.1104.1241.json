Among these, the maximum\ncurrent density of GNRs is important both for fundamental and practical reasons: it is relevant to\nknow what its limiting mechanisms are, how it compares to carbon nanotubes (CNTs), and to\ndetermine the maximum load a GNR transistor could drive within a circuit. By comparison, the\ncurrent in single-wall CNTs is limited to tens of microamperes in diffusive transport due to selfheating and optical phonon scattering [3, 4], although larger currents can be achieved in short\nquasi-ballistic samples [5], under ambipolar transport [6], or under avalanche conditions [7].\nHowever, GNRs differ from CNTs in two key aspects: first, they have edges which can cause\nsignificant scattering, affecting both electrical and thermal transport [1, 8]. Second, they lie flat\non the substrate, which increases their heat dissipation compared to CNTs [9, 10] and can lead to\nlesser heat-limited current degradation. Nevertheless, to date no studies exist on the maximum\ncurrent density of GNRs, or their dissipative behavior under high-field transport.\nHere, we study the current carrying ability of GNRs on SiO2 up to breakdown, and uncover\nkey roles of heat dissipation both along and perpendicular to the device. We measure current\ndensities up to ~3 mA/\u03bcm in ~15 nm wide GNRs, exceeding those typically available in silicon\ndevices. However, the maximum current of GNRs is limited by the high temperature they\nachieve through Joule self-heating. The high-field behavior and breakdown of GNRs is also sensitive to their thermal conductivity (TC), which enables an extraction of this key parameter.\nGNR devices as shown in Fig. 1 were fabricated from solution-deposited GNRs [11], with\nmore details given in the supplement [12]. For comparison, larger exfoliated graphene (XG)\nsamples were also created, with dimensions defined by oxygen plasma pattering. Both types of\nsamples were placed on SiO2 (tox = 300 nm)/Si substrates, with Si also serving as the back-gate\n(G). Source (S) and drain (D) electrodes were made with Pd (20 nm) for GNRs and Cr/Au\n(2/200 nm) for XG devices. GNRs had widths ranging from W = 16-90 nm and lengths L = 0.20.7 \u03bcm. XG devices had W = 0.1-2.6 \u03bcm and lengths L = 3.9-9.7 \u03bcm.\nTo study the upper limits of high-field transport, we measure ID\u2013VDS until devices break\nfrom Joule self-heating, as shown in Fig. 1(b). This is similar to the breakdown thermometry\ntechnique previously applied to CNTs [10, 13] and nanowires [14]. Like with CNTs, the current\ndrops sharply to zero, creating a small gap in the GNR as imaged in Fig. 1(c). Measurements\n\n\f3\nwere made in ambient air, where breakdown (BD) occurs by oxidation at TBD \u2248 600 oC [10]. By\ncomparison, breakdown of control samples in vacuum (~7\u00d710-6 Torr) occurred at six times higher power [Fig. 2(a)], suggesting other failure mechanisms such as defect formation, SiO2 damage\n[10], or even GNR melting (known to occur at ~3600 oC). An existing graphene model [15, 16]\nwas adapted for GNRs [12], calculating ID as a function of applied VGS, VDS and temperature T\nunder diffusive transport conditions:\n\n\uf0e9L\n\uf0f9\nFx\nI D \uf03d qWVDS \uf0ea \uf0f2\ndx \uf0fa\n\uf0eb 0 n \uf028VGx , Tx \uf029 \uf0d7 vd \uf028 Fx , Tx \uf029 \uf0fb\n\n\uf02d1\n\n(1)\n\nwhere q is the elementary charge, x is the coordinate along the graphene channel, n is the total\ncarrier density at location x, VGx = VG \u2013 Vx is the potential between gate and location x, Fx =\n-dVx/dx is the electric field, and vd is the drift velocity including saturation and temperature effects as in Ref. [16]. The current in eq. (1) is solved self-consistently with the Poisson equation\nand the heat equation along the GNR [15], both including 3-dimensional (3D) fringing effects in\nthe capacitance [12] and substrate heat dissipation [g in eq. (3) below]. Simulated ID\u2013VDS curves\nand breakdown voltages in Fig. 1(b) are in good agreement with the experimental data when selfheating (SH) is enabled in the model (solid lines). Without SH the simulated currents are much\nhigher and breakdown is not observed as the temperature remains unchanged.\nTo gain more physical insight into the scaling of SH in such devices, we consider the power\ndissipation at breakdown, PBD = IBD(VBD \u2013 IBDRC) [10], where RC is the electrical contact resistance [12], and IBD and VBD are the current and voltage at breakdown, respectively. We plot PBD\nvs. the square root of the device channel area in Fig. 2(a). To understand the scaling trend observed, we compare the experimental results with the analytic solution of the heat equation along\nthe graphene devices, similar to CNTs [17]:\n\uf0e9 cosh \uf028 L / 2 LH \uf029 \uf02b gLH RT sinh \uf028 L / 2 LH \uf029 \uf0f9\nPBD \uf03d gL \uf028TBD \uf02d T0 \uf029 \uf0ea\n\uf0fa\n\uf0eb cosh \uf028 L / 2 LH \uf029 \uf02b gLH RT sinh \uf028 L / 2 LH \uf029 \uf02d 1 \uf0fb\n\n(2)\n\nwhere T0 is the ambient temperature, LH is the thermal healing length along the device and g is\nthe thermal conductance to substrate per unit length [eq. (3) below]. The thermal resistance at the\nmetal contacts is RT = LHm/[kmtm(W + 2LHm)]. Here tm is the thickness and km \u2248 22 Wm-1K-1 is the\nTC of the metal electrodes (estimated with the Wiedemann-Franz law [18] using their measured\n\n\f4\nresistivity), and LHm is the thermal healing length of heat spreading into the metal contacts. The\ntwo healing lengths are LH = (kWt/g)1/2 and LHm = [km/(koxtmtox)]1/2, both of the order ~0.1 \u03bcm\nhere. The TC of SiO2 kox = 1.3 Wm-1K-1, while t is the thickness and k the TC of the graphene.\nThe heat loss coefficient into the substrate is written as [12]:\n\uf02d1\n\n\uf0ec\n\uf0fc\n\uf070 kox\nk\nR\n\uf0ef\n\uf0ef\ng \uf03d\uf0ed\n\uf02b ox W \uf0fd \uf02b Cox ,\nW\n\uf0ef\n\uf0ee ln \uf0e9\uf0eb6 \uf028 tox W \uf02b 1\uf029 \uf0f9\uf0fb tox \uf0ef\n\uf0fe\n\uf02d1\n\n(3)\n\nand consists of the series combination of the thermal resistance at the graphene/SiO2 interface,\nRCox [9, 19, 20], and the 3D spreading thermal resistance into the SiO2 written here as an analytic\nfit to detailed finite element simulations [12].\nThe two dashed lines in Fig. 2(a) show the predictions of the model for k = 50 and 500\nWm-1K-1. We note that for device dimensions (WL)1/2 \u226b 0.3 \u03bcm, or approximately three times\nthe healing length, heat dissipation is essentially independent of heat flow along the graphene,\nand thus on its TC. As a result, dissipation in larger devices made with exfoliated graphene (XG)\nin Fig. 2 can also be estimated with the simplified approach in Ref. [16]. However for GNRs\nwith dimensions \u2264 3LH, heat dissipation occurs in part along the GNR, and this observation is\nused below to extract their TC. In Fig. 2(b) we plot the maximum current density IBD per width\nW at the breakdown point (temperature ~TBD), and find it can reach over 3 mA/\u03bcm for the narrowest GNRs. This current density appears to scale inversely with width which, at first sight, is a\ncounterintuitive finding compared to silicon devices. This also appears at odds with the present\nunderstanding that GNRs have significantly lower mobility than large-area graphene [2].\nWe suggest that GNRs can dissipate more power and thus carry higher current density at a\ngiven temperature (here, breakdown temperature TBD), consistent with a significant role of 3D\nheat spreading [9]. Figures 3(a-b) display the total device thermal conductance per unit area G\"\n= PBD/(TBD \u2013 T0)/(WL) obtained from the experiments (symbols) and the analytic model from eq.\n(2) (solid lines). We note that for a given device the maximum power (and current) at breakdown\nare proportional to G\". Similar to Fig. 2(b), we find that both the experimental data and our\nmodel scale inversely with the GNR width. To gain a physical understanding of these trends, we\nconsider the heat spreading schematics in Figs. 3(c-e). For \u201elarge\u201f graphene in Fig. 3(c) dissipation occurs mainly \u201edown\u201f into the oxide. Thus, G\" = 1/(RCox + tox/kox) is independent of device\ndimensions when L,W \u2192 \u221e [in practice (LW)1/2 \u226b 3LH], as shown with dash-dotted line in Figs.\n\n\f5\n3(a-b). In general, this expression may include a small heat spreading term into the Si wafer [9,\n16], which was negligible here [12]. For large graphene devices the constant expression is also\nrecovered as G\" = g/W when taking the limit W \u2192 \u221e of eq. (3).\nIn contrast, for \u201enarrow\u201f GNRs the lateral 3D heat spreading into the SiO2 becomes a significant component of the overall thermal conductance of a device [Fig. 3(d)]. In addition, for\n\u201eshort\u201f devices some heat is conducted along the graphene and into the contacts as well [Fig.\n3(e)]. The amount of heat carried out in this manner will depend on the TC and length of the device. The three solid lines in Fig. 3(a) show what the modeled G\" predicts for k = 50, 250, and\n500 Wm-1K-1. As the TC increases, heat is carried more efficiently along the GNR. The device\nlength also matters for \u201eshort\u201f GNRs with L \u2264 3LH, when heat generated within the graphene\nchannel is sunk more effectively into the contacts [12, 17]. As a result, the thermal conductance\nG\" increases as L decreases in Fig. 3(b) (also see [12]). In both cases, as the heat dissipation increases, we also see an increase in device current density as plotted in Fig. 2(b), thus confirming\nthat Joule self-heating is a key current limiter in GNR devices.\nSince heat dissipation is sensitive to heat flow along \u201eshort\u201f GNRs, it is possible to extract\ntheir TC, as shown in Fig. 4. To accomplish this, we iteratively vary k within LH in eq. (2) until\nthe predicted breakdown power matches the measurements, for each device (we assume a unique\nk for each GNR). To estimate the confidence intervals of extracted TC for our GNRs, we consider a range RCox = 1\u20135 \u00d7 10-8 m2K/W for the graphene/SiO2 interface thermal resistance [19-21],\nand an uncertainty of \u00b11 layer in the GNR thickness [12]. The extracted TC along with data from\nthe literature on \u201elarge\u201f graphene [22-24] are displayed in Fig. 4(a). We find a TC range k = 63450 Wm-1K-1 for our GNRs, as summarized in the histogram of Fig. 4(b), with a median\n~130 Wm-1K-1 (at the TBD = 600 oC), or ~80 Wm-1K-1 at 20 oC, nearly an order of magnitude\nlower than the TC of exfoliated graphene on SiO2 [23]. The room temperature estimate is done\nby assuming a mean free path that is independent of temperature (limited by edge or defect scattering), and considering only the temperature variation of graphene heat capacity [10]. Given that\nwe observe no clear dependence of TC on GNR size (i.e. no size effect) in Fig. 4(a), we surmise\nthat here the TC is limited by edge roughness and defect or impurity scattering. However, the\nrange of values extracted can be attributed to variations in edge roughness and defect or impurity density between samples [12]. For instance, recent scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) studies [25] have found that edges of such GNRs vary from atomically smooth to ~1 nm edge\n\n\f6\nroughness. Simulations [8, 26] suggest that edge disorder could nearly account for the variation\nin TC observed in Fig. 4, while different impurity or defect density between samples will only\nserve to broaden the observed distribution.\nBefore concluding, we examine if the thermal and electrical properties of the GNRs are related, and plot the extracted TC vs. the inverse sheet resistance in the Fig. 4(b) inset. Also plotted\nis the electronic contribution to TC (ke), estimated with the Wiedemann-Franz law [18] to be\nnearly always an order magnitude lower (< 10 Wm-1K-1). This estimate is likely an upper limit,\nas the Lorenz number (L0 = 2.45\u00d710-8 W\u03a9K-2) in graphite is unchanged [27], but in nanostructures where edge scattering dominates it is slightly lower than the bulk value [28]. This simple\nanalysis suggests that TC of GNRs is dominated by phonons at room temperature and above.\nHowever, TC and electrical conductance follow similar trends here, indicating that similar scattering mechanisms limit both phonon and electron transport. These scatterers include edges, impurities and defects in GNRs [2, 8, 26, 29].\nIn conclusion, we have shown that high-field transport in GNRs on SiO2 is limited by selfheating. The maximum current density at a given temperature scales inversely with GNR width\nand reaches >3 mA/\u03bcm in ~15 nm wide devices. Dissipation in \u201elarge\u201f graphene (\u226b0.3 \u03bcm, or\nthree times the thermal healing length) is limited primarily by the SiO2 thickness, but dissipation\nin \u201esmall\u201f GNRs improves from 3D heat spreading into the SiO2 and heat flow along the GNR to\nthe contacts. Taking advantage of this sensitivity we found a median TC ~ 80 Wm-1K-1 for GNRs\nat room temperature, with less than 10% electronic contribution.

Fabrication Details\nGraphene nanoribbon (GNR) devices were obtained from a 1,2-dichloroethane organic solution of poly(m-phenylenevinylene-co-2,5-dioctoxy-p-phenylenevinylene) (PmPV) by sonication\nof pristine multi-wall nanotubes (MWNTs) that had been calcined at 650 oC [1]. An ultracentrifuge step was performed to remove the remaining nanotubes, following the method described by\nJiao et al [1]. The solution was spin coated onto ~300 nm SiO2 substrates on highly doped silicon\nwafers. After calcination of the coated substrate at 275 oC for 20 minutes to remove the remaining PmPV, an array of 20 nm thick Pd electrodes and pads were defined by e-beam evaporation\nand lift-off. The contacts were annealed in Ar at 200 oC after which the devices were then annealed electrically. Samples were characterized by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and electrical testing to determine which of electrode pairs correspond to valid devices. Such devices consist\nprimarily of non-AB stacked 2-layer GNRs, however some layer variation is seen in Fig. S1 and\nis characterized in Section 2 below.\nFor comparison, micron-sized exfoliated graphene (XG) devices from Graphene Industries\nwere deposited on heavily n-type doped silicon wafers, also with ~300 nm thermal oxide. XG\ndevices were identified using optical and Raman microscopy. The wafers were backsidemetalized after oxide removal in HF to form back-gate contacts. The graphene flakes were then\npatterned using an O2 plasma reactive ion etch with PMMA masks. E-beam evaporated Cr/Au\n(2/200 nm) was used to define the drain and source contacts by e-beam lithography. After metal\ndeposition and lift-off, the samples were annealed in forming gas at ~400 \u00b0C for ~2 hours to remove the e-beam resist residue.\n2. Thickness of GNRs:\nAs the graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) are fabricated from multi-walled carbon nanotubes\n[1], the layer stacking orientation is random unlike bulk graphite. Thus we cannot use Raman\nspectroscopy to count the number of layers. Instead we rely on the measured thickness from\nAFM scans to distinguish the number of layers of graphene, as shown in Figure S1. We note that\n\n\fSupp-2\n3.5\n\nonly for counting layers and not in our calculations,\nbecause they are not an accurate measurement of the\nreal thickness. The actual thickness that is used in calculations is the number of layers times the inter-atomic\n\nAFM thickness (nm)\n\nnumerical values from AFM scans (Fig. S1) are used\n\n3\n2.5\n2\n1.5\n\nspacing between graphene sheets (0.34 nm).

Because the GNR test structures had two terminals, an indirect\nmethod of extracting RC was employed. Measuring the low bias (LB) resistance, which depends\ngeometrically on the sheet and contact resistance [2], we fit the following expression to our data:\n\nRLB \uf03d\n\n\uf072C\nW\n\n\uf02b\n\n\uf072S L\nWt\n\n.\n\n(E1)\n\nHere RLB is the low bias resistance taken from the linear region of the ID-VDS measurement, \u03c1C is\nthe contact resistivity, \u03c1S is the sheet resistivity of graphene, L is the length, W is the width, and t\nis the thickness of the sample. All measurements were performed at VGS = -40 V back-gate bias,\nwhich eliminates hysteresis effects. We find that variations arising from fabrication have a notable impact on the values extracted when comparing two\n1400\n\ndifferent batches of devices shown in Fig. S2. A fit to the\n\n1200\n\nlines) and an average contact resistance is extracted. The\naverage contact resistivity for batch 1 is \u03c1C = RCW\n~ 630 \u03a9\u22c5\u03bcm and for batch 2 \u03c1C = RCW ~ 250 \u03a9\u22c5\u03bcm,\nwhich are both typical for graphene-Pd contacts, and\nwithin experimental variation observed by us and other\ngroups. From this, we also obtain the sheet resistance\n(\u03c1S/t) for the inset of Fig. 4(b) in the main text.\n\nRLBW (\uf057\uf06dm)\n\ndata from a given batch is made using eq.

Spreading Thermal Resistance of GNRs:\nWe have calculated the thermal spreading resistance of GNRs on SiO2 by finite element\n(FE) simulations, and then obtained a simple analytic model that matches the FE calculations\nover a wide range of parameters. We note that for \u201elarge\u201f graphene devices of dimensions\n(WL)1/2 \u226b 3LH (typically \u226b 0.3 \u03bcm) the heat sinking occurs simply \u201evertically\u201f through the underlying SiO2, and a simple expression for the overall thermal resistance given by Ref. [3] holds,\nRth = 1/(hA) + tox/(koxA) + 1/(2kSiA1/2) with A = LW the area of the channel, h \u2248 108 Wm-2K-1 the\nthermal conductance of the graphene-SiO2 boundary [4], kox and kSi the thermal conductivities of\nSiO2 and of the doped Si wafer. However, for GNRs there is significant lateral heat spreading\ninto the SiO2 and along the GNR. In Fig. S3 we show results of a few FE simulations of GNRs\ndissipating heat into SiO2; it is clear that a simple model of vertical heat flow is inadequate.\nWe then define the heat dissipation coefficient from GNR into substrate per unit length (g).\nTo understand its physical meaning, consider that in steady-state, for a long GNR (far from the\ncontacts), the temperature at location x along the ribbon is simply given by T(x) = T0 + p'(x)/g\nwhere p'(x) is the power dissipated per unit length (in units of W/m) at location x [5]. We numerically calculate the coefficient g for a variety of graphene device widths, from 10 nm to 6 \u03bcm and\nshow the results as symbols in Fig. S4, both for oxide thickness tox = 90 and 300 nm.

The thermal conductivity of the underlying Si wafer is not included as it was found (from the FE simulations) that it plays a very minimal role.\nNote that by comparison, the thermal dissipation per length from carbon nanotubes (CNTs)\non SiO2 is of the order gCNT ~ 0.2 WK-1m-1 [5] and thus much lower than in GNRs which are always wider. This value for CNTs was incorrectly applied to GNRs in a previous study [6], leading to an over-estimate of the thermal conductivity of GNRs.\n\n5. Graphene Model Extended to GNRs:\nTo obtain the current-voltage calculations displayed in Fig. 1(b), we extended a previously\ndeveloped graphene finite-element simulation [3, 7]. Modifications include a lower mobility, as\nis typical of such GNRs [8], \u03bc0,1 = 160 cm2V-1s-1 for D1 and \u03bc0,2 = 280 cm2V-1s-1 for D2. A contact resistance RCW = 250 \u03a9\u22c5\u03bcm was used for both devices in accord with Section #1 above. Together, these parameters were sufficient to model the low-field behavior in Fig. 1(b).\nTo model the high-field and temperature-dependent behavior we used the velocity saturation\nmodel in [3]. The temperature dependence of mobility used was \u03bc(T) = \u03bc0(300/T)1/2, similar to\ncarbon nanotubes [9], but slightly weaker than in \u201elarge\u201f graphene on SiO2 [3]. We note that decisive temperature-dependent mobility data are not yet available for GNRs, and it is likely these\nwould change from sample to sample due to variation in impurity and edge scattering. However,\nweaker temperature dependence of mobility in GNRs is reasonably expected, as similarly observed in metal nanowires vs. bulk metals [10]. Regardless, as it turns out, the specific mobility\nmodel has less impact on the high-field behavior of GNRs, which is dominated by the high-field\nsaturation velocity, including its carrier density and temperature dependence [3].\n\n\fSupp-5\n\nTo calculate the charge density along the GNR we use the approach in Ref. [3], but here we\nmust include fringing effects in the capacitance of the GNR above the Si back-gate. The GNR\ncapacitance per unit area is modeled similarly to the spreading heat effect in Section #3 above:\n\n\uf0ec\n\uf070\n1\uf0fc\nCox \uf03d \uf065 ox\uf065 0 \uf0ed\n\uf02b \uf0fd,\n\uf0ee ln\uf05b6\uf028tox W \uf02b 1\uf029\uf05dW tox \uf0fe\n\n(E3)\n\nwhere the first term represents the fringing capacitance and the second term is the parallel plate\ncapacitance of the GNR. The expression reduces to the familiar Cox = \u03b5ox\u03b50/tox (in Farads per unit\narea) in the limit W \u2192 \u221e as expected for large graphene, and is in good agreement with finiteelement simulations [11].\nThe temperature along the GNR was computed iteratively with the finite-element method\ndescribed in Ref. [7], using k1 = 100 Wm-1K-1 and k2 = 175 Wm-1K-1, scaled consistently with the\nmobility of the two GNRs [note Fig. 4(b) inset in main text], and consistent with thermal conductivity values extracted in the overall study. The heat loss coefficient from GNR to substrate was\nmodeled using the heat spreading expression from eq. E2 above.\n6. Length Dependence on Total Thermal Conductance:\nThe length dependence on the total ther40\n\nG\" and the width as shown in Fig S5. However, the reason for the inverse relation with\nlength is different. As the length of the GNR\ndecreases to the point where it is on the order\nof a few healing lengths (LH), more heat can be\ndissipated into the contacts. It is this dependence on length that allows us to extract the\nthermal conductivity of our samples as indicated in Fig. 4 and Fig. S5.\n\nG\" (MWK-1m-2)\n\nmal conductance G\" is similar to that between\n\n30\n20\n10\n0\n\nW = 25 nm\nW = 50 nm\nW = 100 nm\n\n0\n\n10\nLength (\uf06dm)\n\n1\n\n10\n\nFigure S5.
