As Swift continues to provide prompt\nGRB locations, it becomes more important to answer the question, \"when does\nthe afterglow begin\" to correctly interpret the light curves.\nSubject headings: gamma rays: bursts\n\n1.\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe precise localization and prompt dissemination of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) from\nSwift has opened the very early time domain of GRB afterglows to exploration. Prior to\nSwift, the few bursts with early afterglow detections engendered an assumption that bright\noptical flashes commonly dominated the early light curves; however, the growing sample\nof Swift bursts shows, contrary to these expectations, that this phenomenon is rare and in\nfact many early light curves show a deficit in flux compared to a backward extrapolation of\nlate time behavior. GRB 050319 adds to the growing sample of such bursts with early-time\noptical observations and defines new challenges to interpretation.\nThe position of GRB 050319 (Swift trigger 111622) was distributed as a Gamma-ray\nBurst Coordinates Network (GCN) notice on 2005 March 19 at 09:31:38 UT, with a 4\u2032 radius\nerror box. The notice was issued after a single fast rise exponential decay (FRED) profile\ntriggered the BAT at 09:31:18.44 UT (hereafter ttrigger1 ); however, Chincarini et al. (2005)\nreport that re-analysis of the prompt BAT light curve reveals the burst actually began 137 s\nearlier (ttrigger0 = ttrigger1 \u2212 137 s), but this occurred during a slew so no alert was issued.\nCusumano et al. (2005) give the starting time for GRB 050319 as 09:29:02.70. The BAT\nlight curve thus consists of several peaks with combined T90 = 149.6 \u00b1 0.7 s and a 15-350\nkeV fluence of 1.6 \u00d7 10\u22126 erg cm\u22122 . There are two principle peaks in the \u03b3-ray light curve;\nthe last peak alone had a 7.3 \u00d7 10\u22127 erg cm\u22122 fluence and T90 = 23.5 (Chincarini et al. 2005).\nThe XRT began observations of the afterglow at 9:32:45.53 UT (Krimm et al. 2005).\nAdopting t0 = ttrigger0 as the starting point for the afterglow, Chincarini et al. (2005) find\nan initial steep decline in the X-ray light curve with a power-law index of \u03b11 = \u22127.64 \u00b1 3.83,\nwhich breaks at 329 s to \u03b12 = \u22120.50 \u00b1 0.08, and a second break to \u03b13 = \u22122.07 \u00b1 0.06 that\noccurs at ttrigger0 + 20.5 hrs, where all values are from their first fitting method. Cusumano\net al. (2005) give the slopes as \u03b11 = \u22125.53 \u00b1 0.67, \u03b12 = \u22120.54 \u00b1 0.04, \u03b13 = \u22121.14 \u00b1 0.2 with\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\nbreaks at 384 \u00b1 22 s and 7.2 \u00b1 1.9 hrs, and suggest the initial fast decay may represent the\nlow energy tail from the prompt emission.\nFynbo et al. (2005) report strong absorption lines in the optical spectra, indicating a\nredshift of z = 3.24.\nIn this letter, we report on the early-time optical observations of GRB 050319 with the\nROTSE-IIIb (Robotic Optical Transient Search Experiment) telescope located at McDonald\nObservatory, Texas. The observations are described in \u00a72 and the reduction of the data is\ndetailed in \u00a73. In \u00a74 we present power-law function fits to the light curves exploring both\nttrigger0 and ttrigger1 as the start of the optical emission. We end in \u00a75 with a discussion of\nthe starting time and implications of the multi-peaked burst.\n\n2.\n\nObservations\n\nThe ROTSE-III array is a worldwide network of four 0.45 m robotic, automated telescopes, built for fast (\u223c 6 s) responses to GRB triggers from satellites such as Swift. They\nhave a wide (1.\u25e6 85 \u00d7 1.\u25e6 85) field of view imaged onto a Marconi 2048 \u00d7 2048 back-illuminated\nthinned CCD, and operate without filters. The ROTSE-III systems are described in detail\nin Akerlof et al. (2003).\nROTSE-IIIb responded automatically to the GCN notice in under 8 s with the first exposure starting at 09:31:45.5 UT, just 4 s after the cessation of \u03b3-ray activity. The automated\nscheduler began a program of ten 5-s exposures, ten 20-s exposures, and 149 60-s exposures before the burst position dropped below our elevation limit. Strong winds introduced\ntracking errors, which degraded the quality of the initial images. Near real-time analysis\nof the ROTSE-III images identified a 16th magnitude fading source at \u03b1 = 10h 16m 47.s 9,\n\u03b4 = +43\u25e6 32\u2032 54.\u2032\u20325 (J2000.0) that was not on the Digitized Sky Survey red plates, which we\nreported via the GCN Circulars within 25 minutes of the burst (Rykoff et al. 2005a). Scattered clouds began to reduce the transparency starting 22 minutes into the response. After\n84 minutes, the clouds thickened and the remaining images are not usable.\n\n3.\n\nAnalysis\n\nThe raw ROTSE-III images were processed by an automatic script to eliminate the\ndark current, and were normalized using a flat field constructed from twilight exposures.\nWe then performed relative photometry on the optical transient (OT) and nearby objects\nusing RPHOT, a custom, interactive program implemented in IDL and based around the\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\nDAOPHOT routines (Stetson 1987) ported to IDL by Landsman (1989). RPHOT measures\nboth circular aperture and PSF-fit fluxes for objects and provides checks to determine which\nmethod produces the best results based on the derived photometric precision of field stars.\nWe first constructed a deep coadded frame to serve as a reference for both the photometry and the astrometry. The OT is well detected (S/N> 10) on the reference image\n(REFIM). A set of fiducial reference stars (REFSTARS) was chosen from the REFIM to\nidentify nearby (< 12\u2032 ), isolated stars that were not flagged as either saturated nor blended\nby SExtractor (Bertin & Arnouts 1996). An initial list is generated automatically, and remaining sources that appear to deviate from the stellar PSF are removed by hand. The 57\nREFSTARS selected are used to derive magnitude zeropoints relative to the REFIM.\nTo determine the sky value local to each object under consideration, we calculate a\nGaussian weighted asymmetric clipped mean of the pixels in an annulus of 2r to 3r, where r\nis 3.5 pixels or the local FWHM, which ever is larger. The calculation is iterative, and pixels\n5\u03c3 below the mean and the adjacent pixels are rejected, where \u03c3 is the current estimate of\nthe Gaussian width. Initially, pixels 3\u03c3 above the mean and their neighbors are also rejected,\nand this clipping threshold is raised with each successive iteration. In addition, the OT sky\nannulus is given special consideration; using the deep REFIM, all detected sources in the\nOT sky annulus are masked, and this mask is propagated to the other images. When a preexisting mask is used, clipping is still performed but with higher initial tolerances. When a\nlarge fraction of the sky annulus is masked, it is enlarged to ensure the formal error in the\nlocal sky calculation remains low.\nWith the OT and reference stars selected and any sky mask set, RPHOT steps through\nthe images and displays the full active region, a rectangular area which encompasses the OT\nand all of the REFSTARS, and a close up of the OT and its sky annulus. We looked for\nany global or local problems which might interfere with the photometry. As each image is\ndisplayed, RPHOT matches the REFSTARS up to the REFIM using the RA, DEC solution\ngenerated from objects identified by SExtractor. The matched REFSTARS are then used\nto determine the coordinate mapping from the REFIM. Outliers are rejected from the final\nsolution and later their positions are recalculated using the final transformation. When few\nof the REFSTARS are detected on an image due to a combination of short exposure times\nor poor weather, the solution based on the full frame is used if the transformation residuals\nare smaller. The median transformation residuals for these data are typically \u223c 0.1 pixels.\nThis transformation is then used to map the OT location as found on the REFIM to each\nimage.\nOnce the OT and the reference stars have been located on a given image, aperture\nphotometry is performed in a series of concentric, circular apertures ranging from 0.4 to 2.0\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\ntimes the local FWHM of the image. In addition, a 3.5 pixel (11.4\u2032\u2032 ) fixed aperture was used.\nThe local sky values and standard deviations are set using the sky annuli and weighting as\ndescribed above. RPHOT calculates the weighted average of flux ratios of the reference stars\nto the REFIM in each aperture in order to derive the relative magnitude offsets.\nWe finally use the standard DAOPHOT routines to calculate the PSF-fit fluxes. As the\nPSF does vary significantly across the detector, we selected well detected objects on each\nimage within 14\u2032 of the OT to construct the PSF fitting template; this radius represents\na balance between improved template accuracy gained from an increase in the number of\nobjects included and deviations from the OT's PSF at larger separations that degrade the\ntemplate. We did not modify the DAOPHOT routines to fix the object centroids for PSF\nfitting, but allowed them to move as the fitting required, although measurements where the\ncentroid moved by more that 0.75 times the local FWHM were discarded.\nThe magnitude scale is set in an absolute sense by calibrating reference stars on the\nREFIM to a given system. The ROTSE-III telescopes operate without a filter, and the peak\nsensitivity falls in the R band. We calibrated the magnitude scale using 14 REFSTARS with\nR-band values determined by Henden (2005), and denote these magnitudes as CR . The stars\nused for calibration have colors in the range 0.3 < V \u2212 R < 1.0, with a median of 0.54. Our\nCR magnitudes may differ from the R band values if the spectral energy distribution of the\nOT differs from that of the median reference star. We can estimate this offset by adopting\na blackbody with an effective temperature of 5560 K for our median reference star, and by\nassuming that the OT spectrum can be represented by F\u03bd \u221d \u03bd \u03b2 with \u22121.5 < \u03b2 < \u22120.5.\nWith these assumptions, the unfiltered to R band flux ratio is greater for the OT than for\nthe median reference star, which makes the CR values 0.1 to 0.2 mag brighter than the true\nR band magnitudes. The correction factor, however, is sensitive to the amount of absorption\nalong the line of sight as the measured redshift for the OT (z = 3.24) places rest-frame\nLyman-\u03b1 within our bandpass. Depending on the amount of absorption, this could then\nmake the CR values up to 0.3 mag fainter than the true R band magnitudes. Further note\nwe have not corrected our CR magnitudes for extinction.\nAfter all the images are processed, RPHOT includes tools to assess the data quality and\ncheck the consistency of the relative photometry via the REFSTARS. The reference stars\nwere found to all have flat light curves and no trends were found for objects near the OT.\nRPHOT initially displays only the S/N for the OT. This is to allow for a co-addition\nscheme for the later data when the OT has faded near or below the individual image limiting\nmagnitudes to be investigated without biasing the shape of the light curve. As OTs typically\ndecay as power-laws at later times, co-adding the frames into logarithmically longer and\nlonger time bins is generally needed to maintain the same S/N. For the circular aperture\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\nphotometry, actual co-addition of the frames is not required, but rather a weighted average\nof the fluxes can be used. The PSF-fitting, however, fails for weak or non-detections and\nthus must be performed on coadded frames where the S/N is above 3.\nUsing the magnitude RMS and \u03c72 fits to the reference objects, we determined that the\nPSF fitting produces the best results. Images where the PSF fitting failed were coadded\nto bring the OT S/N above 3. To determine how to group the images for co-adding, we\ncalculated the average fluxes of the OT in the 0.72 FWHM aperture in sets of images weighted\nby the flux error, which is effectively just the sky noise because of the weak OT signal. We\ncontinued to add successive images to a set until the S/N was greater than 3, and then we\nco-added each set of images, again using the flux errors as weights.\n\n4.\n\nResults\n\nThe PSF-fit magnitudes are listed in Table 1 and shown in Figure 1 with times relative\nto ttrigger0 (ie. t = tobs \u2212 t0 where tobs is the time of the observation and t0 = ttrigger0 ).\nWe fit a function of the form f (t) = f0 t\u03b1 to the data and find a power-law decline of\n\u03b1 = \u22120.894+0.034\n\u22120.033 , where we have integrated the probability surface, P (f0 , \u03b1), over all f0\nand found the most probable \u03b1 and the corresponding interval containing 68% of the total\nprobability. The reduced \u03c72 for the best fit is \u03c72 /DoF = 52.4/(34 \u2212 1) = 1.59. A single point\nat tobs \u2212ttrigger0 \u223c 2400 s alone contributes 19.4 to the \u03c72 . We checked the PSF-fit magnitudes\nwith the aperture magnitudes for this point and found similar results. Further, we inspected\nthe photometry for neighboring objects and did not find any anomalous behavior, although\nthere was a spike in cloud opacity during the effective integration.\nAlso shown in Figure 1 are the unfiltered RAPTOR data for the OT (Wo\u017aniak et al.\n2005). We have subtracted 0.21 mag, which represents the systematic zeropoint offset we\nfind between the Henden (2005) field calibration and the USNO-B1.0 R-band magnitudes\nfor our data, from the RAPTOR data1 . This zeropoint shift appears to fully account for the\nsystematic discrepancy between the ROTSE-III and RAPTOR magnitudes and we assume\nthe filter responses are close enough that introduction of a color term is not necessary.\nThe best fit power-law index for the combined ROTSE-III and RAPTOR data is \u03b1 =\n\u22120.854 \u00b1 0.014, with a reduced \u03c72 /DoF of 178.1/(66 \u2212 1) = 2.74. The ROTSE-III point\nat tobs \u2212 ttrigger0 \u223c 2400 s contributes 28.8 to this \u03c72 , and a single RAPTOR point at tobs \u2212\nttrigger0 \u223c 600 s adds an additional 46.5. If we remove the three data points differing by\n1\n\nRAPTOR magnitudes from Wo\u017aniak et al. (2005) were calibrated using the USNO-B1.0 R2 magnitudes;\ntheir reference to USNO-A2.0 R2 magnitudes is a misprint (Vestrand 2005, priv. com.)\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\nmore than 3\u03c3 from the above fit, the best fit value becomes \u03b1 = \u22120.844 \u00b1 0.015 with\n\u03c72 /DoF = 1.459\nUsing the revised BAT trigger time, ttrigger0 , Chincarini et al. (2005) find a dramatic\ninitial decline in the XRT light curve (LC), which breaks to a slower decline at 329 s. This\nbehavior is not mirrored in the optical, nor are there indications of any differences in the\nROTSE-III and RAPTOR data before and after the X-ray break; the optical LC simply\ncontinues the single power-law decline. With t0 = ttrigger0 , the initial X-ray decline is also\nthe steepest for any of the growing number of Swift GRBs. However, Chincarini et al. (2005)\nfind the X-ray LC is quite similar to that of GRB 050318 if the start time coincides with the\nlater BAT trigger, ttrigger1 . With this convention, the initial decline becomes more shallow\nand is more typical of other XRT afterglows (for example, see Figure 1 from Tagliaferri et\nal. 2005). We therefore investigated the impact of this change in epoch on the optical light\ncurve. Figure 2 shows the ROTSE-III and RAPTOR data deviate from a simple power-law\ndecline with this choice for the afterglow start time. Wo\u017aniak et al. (2005) have analyzed\nthe RAPTOR data using t0 = ttrigger1 and found a broken power-law model gives a more\nacceptable fit. Fitting a smoothly broken power-law of the form\nf (t) = fb 21/s [(t/tb )\u2212s\u03b11 + (t/tb )\u2212s\u03b12 ]\u22121/s\n\n(1)\n\nwith the smoothing parameter fixed at s = 20 for a sharp slope transition, the ROTSE+0.054\n+91\nIII data gives \u03b11 = \u22120.354+0.071\n\u22120.062 , \u03b12 = \u22120.788\u22120.060 , and a break time tb = 281\u221269 s,\nwith a best fit \u03c72 /DoF = 1.57. A joint fit to the ROTSE-III and RAPTOR data gives\n+0.030\n+31\n\u03b11 = \u22120.364+0.020\n\u22120.019 , \u03b12 = \u22120.881\u22120.031 , and a break time tb = 418\u221230 s, with a best fit\n\u03c72 /DoF = 2.24. Again, the ROTSE-III and RAPTOR outliers mentioned above add 19.9\nand 27.2 to the \u03c72 , respectively. Removing the three > 3\u03c3 outliers improves the joint fit to\n\u03b11 = \u22120.367 \u00b1 0.022, \u03b12 = \u22120.864 \u00b1 0.034, and a break time tb = 405 \u00b1 40 s, with a best fit\n\u03c72 /DoF = 1.51.\nIt is difficult to explain such an early break in the optical LC with the derived decay\nslopes in the context of the fireball model. One possibility is that energy injection from a\nlong lived inner engine may be sustaining the optical emission until the break. If so, and\nassuming the OT would otherwise have faded as a simple power-law with \u03b1 = \u03b12 from the\nfirst ROTSE-III point, then the energy injected from tobs \u2212 ttrigger1 = 30 s to tb increased the\npost-break optical flux by 3.9 times.\nWe have also considered the possibility that the break is due to a synchrotron break. For\nexample, if we naively assume the pre-break data were taken around when the typical electron\nsynchrotron frequency, \u03bdm , drops below our observing range then the observed \u03b11 could be\nthe typical \u22121/4 index for fast cooling and a constant-density ISM diluted by the transition\nto the steeper decline. However, for the later decline we should have \u03b12 = \u2212(3p \u2212 2)/4,\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\nwhich results in, p = 1.84, an unusual value for the electron power-law index (note when\np < 2, there is an imposed maximum in the distribution of electron Lorentz factors, which\nwill alter the relation of p and \u03b1). There is not a fixed value for p that predicts both \u03b11\nand \u03b12 using the relations for slow cooling with 1 < p < 2 derived in Dai & Cheng (2001).\nOther synchrotron breaks, such as the cooling break, result in similarly atypical values for\np. Further, the X-ray LC breaks to a more shallow decline instead of the switch to a steeper\ndecline found in the optical at close to the same time, which is not commensurate with a\nsynchrotron break. The break is also not explained by a jet break since it is not achromatic.\n\n5.\n\nDiscussion\n\nThe afterglow of GRB050319 may have began at the first of two strong \u03b3-ray peaks\nwith the steepest decline in the X-ray of any of the GRBs captured by Swift and showed\nno correlated behavior in its optical LC, or perhaps it began at the last peak in the \u03b3-rays\nand had a normal X-ray LC and an optical LC with a break around 300 s between unusual\npower-law decline indices. In either case there is no correlation between the X-ray and optical\nlight curves: the X-ray LC breaks do not coincide with optical breaks and the X-ray decline\nrates do not match the optical slopes. The decline mismatch means that the X-ray to optical\ncolor is continually changing and the spectral slope \u03b2 (where f\u03bd \u221d \u03bd \u03b2 ) is not a constant from\nthe X-ray to the optical.\nIn the context of the fireball model, reverse shock emission has been predicted to dominate the early afterglow, giving a steep initial decline (Sari & Piran 1999). Reverse shock\nemission has been used to explain the initial rapid optical decline of the GRB 990123 afterglow, and may account for the steep decline in the early XRT light curve for GRB 050319;\nhowever, this emission is expected to peak in the optical or infrared and no such signal is\nobserved in the contemporaneous optical data. Tagliaferri et al. (2005) and Kobayashi et al.\n(2005), however, have discussed suppression of the optical signal through inverse Compton\nscattering. In this case the optical photons produced in the reverse shock are up-scattered,\nwhich creates the fast decaying X-ray signal. Kobayashi et al. (2005) show that while inverse\nCompton effects can highly suppress optical emission in the reverse shock, inverse Compton\nemission can be less important in the forward shock. Up-scattering of the reverse shock\noptical emission could help explain why there is no change in the optical decay during the\nfirst break in the X-ray LC. However, Cusumano et al. (2005) suggest the initial fast X-ray\ndecay may represent the low energy tail from the prompt emission, in which case no reverse\nshock emission was observed in any band.\nThe true behavior of the optical light curve is critically dependent on the choice of\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\nt0 . In general, for accurate analysis the error in t0 must be much less than the epochs in\nwhich power-laws are to be evaluated. Although the reduced \u03c72 is smaller for the smoothly\nbroken power-law fit to the combined ROTSE-III and RAPTOR data with t0 = ttrigger1\nthan for the single power-law fit to the same data with t0 = ttrigger0 (including the outliers\nin both cases), neither model can acceptably account for the scatter shown in the sample. If\nsuch fluctuations are intrinsic to early OT light curves, it will be difficult to use statistical\narguments to determine the starting time, t0 , through fits to simple power-law functions.\nThe behavior predicted by the fits for the two choices of t0 considered differ by about 0.2\nmag during later times with published magnitude estimates, although the errors for the two\nmodels overlap. Wo\u017aniak et al. (2005) have shown using data from the GCN Circulars that\nthe decay rate of the OT appears to slow after 1.3 hours, and as a result we cannot use\npredictions for the late time behavior from the single and smoothly broken power-law fits of\nthe early time data to constrain t0 .\nIf the optical emission began during the first peak in the \u03b3-rays then there are no\ndeviations from a simple power-law in the early phases that can be attributed to the last\n\u03b3-ray peak, even though the ROTSE-III data begin 27 s after the last peak and just 4 s after\nthe cessation of \u03b3-ray activity. Therefore this scenario leads to a physical difference in the\nfirst \u03b3-ray peak, which is followed by long lived optical emission, and the last \u03b3-ray peak,\nwhich has no detected optical emission and at most optical emission several times fainter\nthan that associated with the first peak.\nAs the GRB050319 OT clearly illustrates, shifting t0 to a later time can turn a simple\npower-law into an apparent broken power law. Because this shift, t\u20320 = t0 + \u2206t, makes the\nlogarithmic difference between two epochs larger while the drop in flux remains the same,\nthe early light curve (t\u2032 < \u2206t) appears to flatten out and we infer \u03b11\u2032 \u2248 0. For t\u2032 \u226b \u2206t the\neffect is negligible and we have \u03b12\u2032 \u2248 \u03b1. Setting \u03b11 = 0, \u03b11 = \u03b1 and s = \u22121/\u03b1 into equation\n1 gives f (t) = f0\u2032 (t + tb )\u03b1 , which is identical to a single power-law shifted by tb . However, a\nbroken power-law with a sharp transition (s \u226b \u22121/\u03b12 ) can be distinguished from a single\npower-law with an incorrect t0 if the light curve is well sampled and the error bars are \u223c 0.1\nmag or smaller, which ROTSE-III can deliver. It is therefore possible at least to determine\nif an apparent early light curve break is due to an error in the adopted t0 even for \u03b11 \u2248 0\nif the transition is sharp. There are events which exhibit just such behavior, such as the\noptical transient to GRB 050801 (Rykoff et al. 2005b).\nIt is important to note that gamma-ray burst triggers are defined by instrument response\nand software algorithms and do not necessarily mark the start of the burst itself, much less\nthe afterglow. There are many examples where the \u03b3-ray emission is detected prior to\nthe formal trigger. For example, GRB 050915B showed \u03b3-ray activity 10 s prior to the\n\n\f\u2013 10 \u2013\nformal trigger (Falcone et al. 2005), while emission began at least 8s before the GRB 050908\ntrigger (Sato et al. 2005) and GRB 050827 started 15s before its trigger (Sakamoto et al.\n2005). Lazzati (2005) searched BATSE data in the range \u2212200s < t < ttrigger and found\nthat about 20% of bursts showed evidence for precursor activity. Setting t0 to the precursor\ntime would effectively steepen the observed afterglow decline rate and could thus lead to\na different interpretation of the LC, such as the presence of reverse shock emission. There\nhave also been bright bursts like GRB 990123 that began with \u223c 15s of weak \u03b3-ray emission\nand later showed bright peaks (Briggs et al. 1999). Assuming a similar light curve behavior\nfor weaker bursts, the trigger time could be delayed in some cases. The derived decline rate\nbased on the trigger would then be slower than the decline rate based on the true start of\nthe burst, and the shift could introduce an apparent break in the observed afterglow LC.\nThe extended and highly variable nature of long-duration GRBs suggests the afterglow\nitself may not begin cleanly from a given epoch, but rather we might expect a turn-on phase\nwhere energy injection drives the optical emission and perhaps produces a highly variable\nlight curve similar to that of GRB 050319 with t0 = ttrigger1 . However if ttrigger0 did mark the\nstart of the afterglow, then the lack of a bulk departure from the simple power-law decline\nas a result of energy injection related to the last \u03b3-ray peak argues against a \u03b3-ray/optical\ncorrelation. As Swift continues to provide prompt GRB locations, it becomes more important\nto answer the question, \"when does the afterglow begin\" to correctly interpret the light\ncurves.\nThis work has been supported by NASA grants NNG-04WC41G and F006794, NSF\ngrants AST-0119685 and 0105221, the Australian Research Council, the University of New\nSouth Wales, and the University of Michigan.
