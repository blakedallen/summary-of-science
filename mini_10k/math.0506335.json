We find presentations by generators and relations for the equivariant quantum cohomology of the Grassmannian. For these presentations,\nwe also find determinantal formulae for the equivariant quantum Schubert\nclasses. To prove this, we use the theory of factorial Schur functions and a\ncharacterization of the equivariant quantum cohomology ring.\n\n1. Introduction\nLet X denote the Grassmannian Gr(p, m) of subspaces of dimension p in Cm .\nOne of the fundamental problems in the study of the equivariant quantum cohomology algebra of X is to compute its structure constants, which are the 3-point,\ngenus 0, equivariant Gromov-Witten invariants. The goal of this paper is to give\na method for such a computation. Concretely, we realize the equivariant quantum\ncohomology as a ring given by generators and relations and we find polynomial representatives (i.e. Giambelli formulae) for the equivariant quantum Schubert classes\n(which form a module-basis for this ring).1 These polynomials will be given by\ncertain determinants which appear in the Jacobi-Trudi formulae for the factorial\nSchur functions (see \u00a72 below for details).\nSince the equivariant quantum cohomology ring specializes to both quantum and\nequivariant cohomology rings, we also obtain, as corollaries, determinantal formulae\nfor the Schubert classes in the quantum and equivariant cohomology. In fact, in the\nquantum case, we recover Bertram's quantum Giambelli formula [2]. In the case of\nequivariant cohomology, we show that the factorial Schur functions represent the\nequivariant Schubert classes. The latter result, although not explicitly stated in\nthe literature, seems to have been known before (cf. Remark 2 in \u00a75).\nWe recall next some of the basic facts about the equivariant quantum cohomology and fix the notation. The torus T \u2243 (C\u2217 )m acts on the Grassmannian X by\nthe action induced from the GL(m)\u2212action. The T \u2212equivariant cohomology of a\npoint, denoted \u039b, is the polynomial ring Z[T1 , ..., Tm ] in the equivariant parameters Ti , graded by deg Ti = 1 (see \u00a75.1 for a geometric interpretation of Ti ). Let\nq be an indeterminate of degree m. The T \u2212equivariant quantum cohomology of\nX, denoted QHT\u2217 (X), is a graded, commutative, \u039b[q]\u2212algebra with a \u039b[q]\u2212basis\n{\u03c3\u03bb } indexed by partitions \u03bb = (\u03bb1 , ..., \u03bbp ) included in the p \u00d7 (m \u2212 p) rectangle\n(i.e. \u03bb1 , ..., \u03bbp are integers such that m \u2212 p > \u03bb1 > ... > \u03bbp > 0). This basis is\nDate: November 5, 2018.\nMSC: 14N35 (primary); 05E05;14F43 (secondary).\n1It is a standard fact that given a ring R/I, where R is a polynomial ring and I an ideal, together\nwith some elements in R which determine a module-basis for R/I, the structure constants for this\nbasis can be computed using e.g. Groebner basis methods.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nLEONARDO CONSTANTIN MIHALCEA\n\ndetermined by the Schubert varieties in X, defined with respect to the standard\nflag, and the classes \u03c3\u03bb will be called (equivariant quantum) Schubert classes. More\ndetails are given in \u00a73 and especially in [21]. The equivariant quantum multiplication is denoted by \u25e6 and it is determined by the 3-pointed, genus 0, equivariant\nGromov-Witten invariants c\u03bd,d\n\u03bb,\u03bc . In this paper we refer to these coefficients as the\nequivariant quantum Littlewood-Richardson coefficients, abbreviated EQLR. They\nhave been introduced by Givental-Kim in [11] (see also [14, 10, 15]), together with\nthe equivariant quantum cohomology. Then, by definition,\nXX\n\u03c3\u03bb \u25e6 \u03c3\u03bc =\nq d c\u03bd,d\n\u03bb,\u03bc \u03c3\u03bd .\nd>0 \u03bd\n\nc\u03bd,d\n\u03bb,\u03bc\n\nThe EQLR coefficients\nare homogeneous polynomials in \u039b of degree |\u03bb| +\n|\u03bc| \u2212 |\u03bd| \u2212 md, where |\u03b1| denotes the sum of all parts of the partition \u03b1. They\nare equal to the structure constants of equivariant cohomology if d = 0 and to\nthose of quantum cohomology (i.e. to the ordinary Gromov-Witten invariants)\nif |\u03bb| + |\u03bc| \u2212 |\u03bd| \u2212 md = 0. Equivalently, the quotient of equivariant quantum\ncohomology ring by the ideal generated by the equivariant parameters Ti yields the\nquantum cohomology ring of X (a Z[q]\u2212algebra), while the quotient by the ideal\ngenerated by q yields the T \u2212equivariant cohomology of X (a \u039b\u2212algebra). More\nabout the EQLR coefficients, including a certain positivity, which generalizes the\npositivity enjoyed by the equivariant coefficients, can be found in [21, 22].\n1.1. Statement of the results. As we have noted before, the equivariant quantum Giambelli formula which we obtain is a \"factorial\" generalization of Bertram's\nquantum Giambelli formula [2], and, as in that case, it doesn't involve the quantum\nparameter q. It is closely related to a certain generalization of ordinary Schur functions, called factorial Schur functions. These are polynomials s\u03bb (x; t) in two sets\nof variables: x = (x1 , ..., xp ) and t = (ti )i\u2208Z . They play a fundamental role in the\nstudy of central elements in the universal enveloping algebra of gl(n) ([25, 26, 23]).\nOne of their definitions is via a \"factorial Jacobi-Trudi\" determinant, and this\ndeterminant will represent the equivariant quantum Schubert classes. The basic\nproperties of the factorial Schur functions are given in \u00a72.\nDenote by hi (x; t) (respectively by ej (x; t)) the complete homogeneous (respectively, elementary) factorial Schur functions. They are equal to s(i) (x; t) (respectively s(1)i (x; t)), where (i) (resp. (1)i ) denotes the partition (i, 0, ..., 0) (resp.\n(1, ..., 1, 0, ..., 0), with i 1's). Let t = (ti )i\u2208Z be the sequence defined by\n\u001a\nTm\u2212i+1 if 1 6 i 6 m\nti =\n0\notherwise\n\nwhere Ti is an equivariant parameter. The next definitions are inspired from those\nused in the theory of factorial Schur functions. For an integer s we define the\nshifted sequence \u03c4 s t to be the sequence whose i\u2212th term (\u03c4 s t)i is equal to ts+i . Let\nh1 , ..., hm\u2212p and e1 , ..., ep denote two sets of indeterminates (these correspond to the\ncomplete homogeneous, respectively, elementary, factorial Schur functions). Often\none considers shifts s\u03bb (x|\u03c4 s t) of s\u03bb (x|t) by shifting the sequence (ti ). Corresponding\nto these shifts we define the shifted indeterminates \u03c4 \u2212s hi , respectively \u03c4 s ej , where\ns is a nonnegative integer, as elements of \u039b[h1 , ..., hm\u2212p ], respectively \u039b[e1 , ..., ep ].\nThe definition of \u03c4 \u2212s hj is given inductively as a function of \u03c4 \u2212s+1 hj and \u03c4 \u2212s+1 hj\u22121 ,\nand it is modelled on an equation which relates hj (x|\u03c4 \u2212s t) to hj (x|\u03c4 \u2212s+1 t) (see eq.\n\n\fGIAMBELLI FORMULAE FOR EQUIVARIANT QUANTUM COHOMOLOGY\n\n3\n\n(2.6) below, with a := \u03c4 \u2212s+1 t). Concretely, \u03c4 0 hj = hj , \u03c4 \u22121 hj = hj + (tj\u22121+p \u2212\nt0 )hj\u22121 and, in general,\n(1.1)\n\n\u03c4 \u2212s hj = \u03c4 \u2212s+1 hj + (tj+p\u2212s \u2212 t1\u2212s )\u03c4 \u2212s+1 hj\u22121 .\n\nSimilarly, the definition of \u03c4 s ei is modelled on an equation which relates ej+1 (x|\u03c4 s t)\nto ej+1 (x|\u03c4 s\u22121 t) (see eq. (2.7) below, with a := \u03c4 s\u22121 t), and it is given by\n(1.2)\n\n\u03c4 s ei = \u03c4 s\u22121 ei + (ts \u2212 tp\u2212i+s+1 )\u03c4 s\u22121 ei\u22121\n\nwith \u03c4 0 ei = ei . By convention, h0 = e0 = 1, hj = 0 if j < 0 or j > m \u2212 p, and\nei = 0 if i < 0 or i > p.\nFor \u03bb a partition in the p \u00d7 (m \u2212 p) rectangle define s\u03bb \u2208 \u039b[h1 , ..., hm\u2212p ], respectively se\u03bb \u2208 \u039b[e1 , ..., ep ], analogously to the definition of the factorial Schur function\ns\u03bb (x|t), via the factorial Jacobi-Trudi determinants (cf. (2.4) below):\n\n(1.3)\n\ns\u03bb = det(\u03c4 1\u2212j h\u03bbi +j\u2212i )16i,j6p ,\n\n(1.4)\n\nse\u03bb = det(\u03c4 j\u22121 e\u03bb\u2032i +j\u2212i )16i,j6m\u2212p .\n\nHere \u03bb\u2032 = (\u03bb\u20321 , ..., \u03bb\u2032m\u2212p ) denotes the partition conjugate to \u03bb, i.e. the partition in\nthe (m \u2212 p) \u00d7 p rectangle whose i\u2212th part is equal to the length of the i\u2212th column\nof the Young diagram of \u03bb.\nBy Hk , for m \u2212 p < k 6 m, respectively Ek , for p < k 6 m, we denote the\ndeterminants from (1.4), respectively (1.3), above, corresponding to partitions (k),\nrespectively (1)k , for the appropriate k:\n(1.5)\n\nHk = det(\u03c4 j\u22121 e1+j\u2212i )16i,j6k ,\n\n(1.6)\n\nEk = det(\u03c4 1\u2212j h1+j\u2212i )16i,j6k .\n\nWith this notation, we present the main result of this paper:\nTheorem 1.1.

More generally, the image of s\u03bb is the Schubert class \u03c3\u03bb .\n(b)(Dual version) There is a canonical isomorphism of \u039b[q]\u2212algebras\n\u039b[q][e1 , ..., ep ]/hHm\u2212p+1 , ..., Hm\u22121 , Hm + (\u22121)p qi \u2212\u2192 QH \u2217T (X),\nsending ej to \u03c3(1)j and se\u03bb to the Schubert class \u03c3\u03bb .\n\nPresentations by generators and relations for the equivariant quantum cohomology of the type A partial flag manifolds have also been obtained by A. Givental and\nB. Kim in [11, 13], and, in general, for flag manifolds X = G/B (G a connected,\nsemisimple, complex Lie group and B a Borel subgroup) by B. Kim in [15]. In the\ncase of the Grassmannian, their presentation is given as\n\u039b[a1 , ..., ap , b1 , ...., bm\u2212p ]/I\nP\nwhere I is the ideal generated by\ni+j=k ai bj = ek (T1 , ..., Tm ) and ap bm\u2212p =\nem (T1 , ..., Tm ) + (\u22121)p q; the sum is over integers i, j such that 0 6 i 6 p and\n0 6 j 6 m \u2212 p; k varies between 1 and m \u2212 1 and a0 = b0 = 1; ek denotes\nthe elementary symmetric function. We also note the results from [21], where a\n\n\f4\n\nLEONARDO CONSTANTIN MIHALCEA\n\nrecursive relation, derived from a multiplication rule with the class \u03c3(1) (a PieriChevalley rule), gives another method to compute the EQLR coefficients.\n1.2. Idea of proof. The proof of the theorem uses the theory of factorial Schur\nfunctions and a characterization of the equivariant quantum cohomology ([21]).\nWe prove first the \"dual version\" of the statement. For that we show an equivalent\nresult, where in all the formulae \u03c4 s ej is replaced by ej (x|\u03c4 s t) (here x = (x1 , ..., xp )\nand t = (ti ) is the sequence defined in the beginning of \u00a71.1). A key role in this\n\"translation\" is played by a factorial version of the Jacobi-Trudi formula (cf. [20],\npag. 56). Then we prove that the images of the polynomials s\u03bb (x|t), for \u03bb included\nin the p\u00d7(m\u2212p) rectangle, form a \u039b[q]\u2212basis in the claimed presentation. A special\nmultiplication formula, due to Molev and Sagan ([24], see also [16]), computes the\nproduct s\u03bb (x|t)s(1) (x|t) as a sum of s\u03bc (x|t), but with \u03bc having possibly a part\nlarger than m \u2212 p. Using again the factorial Jacobi-Trudi formula, we prove that,\nmodulo the relations ideal, this multiplication is precisely the equivariant quantum\nPieri-Chevalley rule (see [21]). But this rule determines completely QH \u2217T (X), and\nso the \"dual\" statement is proved. To prove the first statement, we construct a\nmorphism from \u039b[q][h1 , ..., hm\u2212p ] to the dual presentation and show that its kernel\nis the claimed ideal of relations.\nAcknowledgements: I am indebted to S.

The factorial Schur function s\u03bb (x|a) is a homogeneous\npolynomial in two sets of variables: x = (x1 , ..., xp ) and a doubly infinite sequence\na = (ai )i\u2208Z . An initial (non-homogeneous) version of these polynomials, for ai =\ni \u2212 1 if 1 6 i 6 p and 0 otherwise, was first studied by L. Biedenharn and J.\nLouck in [4], then by W. Chen and J. Louck in [7]. The general version was\nconsidered by I. Macdonald [19], then studied further in [12, 23, 24] and [20], Ch.\nI.3. These functions, as well as a different version of them, called shifted Schur\nfunctions (see [25, 26]), play an important role in the study of the center of the\nuniversal enveloping algebra of gl(n), Capelli identities and quantum immanants.\nIn a geometric context, the factorial Schur functions appeared in [16], expressing\nthe result of the localization of an equivariant Schubert class to a T \u2212fixed point.\nFor any variable y and any sequence (ai ) define the \"generalized factorial power\":\n(y|a)k = (y \u2212 a1 ) * * * (y \u2212 ak ).\nLet \u03bb be a partition with at most p parts. Following [24], define the factorial Schur\nfunction s\u03bb (x|a) to be\ns\u03bb (x|a) =\n\ndet[(xj |a)\u03bbi +p\u2212i ]16i,j6p\n.\ndet[(xj |a)p\u2212i ]16i,j6p\n\nDenote by hk (x|a) (respectively ek (x|a)) the factorial complete homogeneous Schur\nfunctions (resp. the factorial elementary Schur functions). We adopt the usual\nconvention that hk (x|a) and ek (x|a) are equal to zero if k is negative. For k larger\nthan p, ek (x|a) is set equal to zero, also by convention. Let Z[a] denote the ring of\n\n\fGIAMBELLI FORMULAE FOR EQUIVARIANT QUANTUM COHOMOLOGY\n\n5\n\npolynomials in variables ai (i-integer). We start enumerating the relevant properties of the factorial Schur functions:\n(A) (Basis) The factorial Schur functions s\u03bb (x|a), where \u03bb has at most p parts,\nform a Z[a]\u2212basis for the ring of polynomials in Z[a][x] symmetric in the x\u2212variables\n([20], I.3, pag. 55). This is a consequence of the fact that\ns\u03bb (x|a) = s\u03bb (x) + terms of lower degree in x.\nThen\ns\u03bb (x|a)s\u03bc (x|a) =\n\nX\n\nc\u03bd\u03bb\u03bc (a)s\u03bd (x|a)\n\n\u03bd\n\nwhere the coefficients c\u03bd\u03bb\u03bc (a) are homogeneous polynomials in Z[a] of degree |\u03bb| +\n|\u03bc| \u2212 |\u03bd|. They are equal to the usual Littlewood-Richardson coefficients c\u03bd\u03bb\u03bc if\n|\u03bb| + |\u03bc| = |\u03bd| and are equal to 0 if |\u03bb| + |\u03bc| < |\u03bd| (cf. [24] \u00a72).\n(B) (Vanishing Theorem, [24], Thm. 2.1, see also [25]) Let \u03bb = (\u03bb1 , ..., \u03bbp )\nand \u03c1 = (\u03c11 , ..., \u03c1p ) be two partitions of length at most p. Define the sequence a\u03c1\nby a\u03c1 = (a\u03c11 +p , ..., a\u03c1p +1 ). Then\n\n(2.1)\n\ns\u03bb (a\u03c1 |a) =\n\n(\n\n0\nQ\n\nif \u03bb ( \u03c1\n\u2032\n(a\n\u2212\na\n)\nif\n\u03bb=\u03c1\n\u03bb\n+p\u2212i+1\ni\n(i,j)\u2208\u03bb\np\u2212\u03bb +j\nj\n\nwhere \u03bb\u2032 is the conjugate partition of \u03bb, and (i, j) \u2208 \u03bb means that j varies between\n1 and \u03bbi , if \u03bbi > 0. We recall a consequence of the Vanishing Theorem:\nCorollary 2.1. The coefficients c\u03bd\u03bb\u03bc (a) satisfy the following properties:\n(i) c\u03bd\u03bb\u03bc (a) = 0 if \u03bb or \u03bc are not included in \u03bd.\n(ii) If the partitions \u03bc and \u03bd are equal, then\nc\u03bc\u03bb\u03bc (a) = s\u03bb (a\u03bc |a).\nProof. (i) is part of the Theorem 3.1 in [24] while (ii) follows from the proof of\nexpression (10) in [24].\n\u0003\n(C) (Factorial Pieri-Chevalley rule, see the proof of Prop. 3.2 in [24] or [26],\nThm. 9.1.) Let (1) denote the partition (1, 0, ..., 0) (p parts) and let \u03bb be a partition\nwith at most p parts. Then\nX\n(2.2)\ns(1) (x|a)s\u03bb (x|a) =\ns\u03bc (x|a) + c\u03bb(1),\u03bb (a)s\u03bb (x|a)\n\u03bc\u2192\u03bb\n\nwhere \u03bc \u2192 \u03bb means that \u03bc contains \u03bb and has one more box than \u03bb (recall that,\nby definition, \u03bc has at most p parts). By Corollary 2.1, c\u03bb(1),\u03bb (a) = s(1) (a\u03bb |a) and\nthe last expression turns out to be\n(2.3)\n\ns(1) (a\u03bb |a) =\n\np\nX\ni=1\n\na\u03bbi +p+1\u2212i \u2212\n\np\nX\n\naj .\n\nj=1\n\n(D) (Jacobi-Trudi identities, see [20], I.3, Ex. 20(c), pag. 56 or [23], Thm.\n3.1.) Let \u03c4 r a be the sequence whose nth term is an+r and let \u03bb be a partition with\n\n\f6\n\nLEONARDO CONSTANTIN MIHALCEA\n\nat most p parts. Then\n(2.4)\n\ns\u03bb (x|a)\n\n= det[h\u03bbi \u2212i+j (x|\u03c4 1\u2212j a)]16i,j6p\n= det[e\u03bb\u2032 \u2212i+j (x|\u03c4 j\u22121 a)]16i,j6m\u2212p ,\n\n(2.5)\n\ni\n\nwhere \u03bb\u2032 is the partition conjugate of \u03bb.\nThe following proposition gives an inductive way of computing the \"shifted\"\npolynomials hk (x|\u03c4 s a), respectively ek (x|\u03c4 s a), starting from the \"unshifted\" ones.\nProposition 2.2. The following identities hold in Z[a][x]:\n(2.6)\n\nhi+1 (x|\u03c4 \u22121 a) = hi+1 (x|a) + (ai+p \u2212 a0 )hi (x|a)\n\n(2.7)\n\nej+1 (x|\u03c4 a) = ej+1 (x|a) + (a1 \u2212 ap\u2212j+1 )ej (x|a).\n\nProof. One uses the formulae\nX\n(2.8)\nhk (x|a) =\n\n(xi1 \u2212 ai1 )(xi2 \u2212 ai2 +1 ) * ... * (xik \u2212 aik +k\u22121 ),\n\n(2.9)\n\n(xi1 \u2212 ai1 )(xi2 \u2212 ai2 \u22121 ) * ... * (xik \u2212 aik +k\u22121 )\n\n16i1 6...6ik 6p\n\nek (x|a) =\n\nX\n\n16i1 <...<ik 6p\n\n(cf. [23], eqs. (1.2) and (1.3)). Then the computations are straightforward.\n\u2212s\n\n\u0003\n\ns\n\nBy the Jacobi-Trudi formula, hi (x|\u03c4 a) (resp. ej (x|\u03c4 a)) generate the algebra\nof polynomials in Z[a][x] symmetric in the x\u2212variables. Then Prop. 2.2 implies:\nCorollary 2.3. The factorial complete homogeneous (resp. elementary) symmetric\nfunctions hi (x|a) for 1 6 i (resp. ej (x|a) for 1 6 j 6 p) generate the algebra of\npolynomials in Z[a][x] symmetric in the x\u2212variables.\nWe will need the fact that the Jacobi-Trudi formula (2.5) generalizes to the case\nwhen \u03bb = (1)k with k > p (when, by convention, ek (x|a) = 0), and this is the\ncontent of the next proposition (see also equation (6.10) in [19]):\nProposition 2.4. The following holds for any positive integer k > p:\n\u0001\ndet h1+j\u2212i (x|\u03c4 1\u2212j a) 16i,j6k = 0.\n\nProof. Denote by Ek (x|a) the determinant in question. Note that, if k 6 p, this is\nequal to ek (x|a), by the Jacobi-Trudi formula. We will need a formula proved in\n[20], I.3, pag.56, Ex. 20(b):\np\nX\n(\u22121)r er (x|a)hs\u2212r (x|\u03c4 1\u2212s a) = 0\n\n(2.10)\n\nr=0\n\nfor any positive integer s. To prove the proposition, we use induction on k > p + 1.\nExpanding Ep+1 (x|a) after the last column yields:\nEp+1 (x|a)\n\n=\n\np\nX\n\n(\u22121)r+1+p+1 hp+1\u2212r (x|\u03c4 \u2212p a)er (x|a)\n\nr=0\n\n= (\u22121)p+2\n\np\nX\nr=0\n\n= 0\n\n(\u22121)r hp+1\u2212r (x|\u03c4 \u2212p a)er (x|a)\n\n\fGIAMBELLI FORMULAE FOR EQUIVARIANT QUANTUM COHOMOLOGY\n\n7\n\nwhere the last equality follows from (2.10) by taking s = p + 1. Assume that\nEk (x|a) = 0 for all p < k < k0 . Expanding the determinant defining Ek0 (x|t) after\nthe last column, and using the induction hypothesis, yields\nEk0 (x|a)\n\n=\n\np\nX\n\n(\u22121)r+1+k0 hk0 \u2212r (x|\u03c4 1\u2212k0 a)er (x|a)\n\nr=0\n\nk0 +1\n\n= (\u22121)\n\np\nX\n\n(\u22121)r hk0 \u2212r (x|\u03c4 1\u2212k0 a)er (x|a)\n\nr=0\n\n= 0\nusing again (2.10) with s = k0 .\n\n\u0003\n\n3. Equivariant quantum cohomology of the Grassmannian\nIn this section we recall some basic properties of the equivariant quantum cohomology. As before, X denotes the Grassmannian Gr(p, m), and \u039b the polynomial\nring Z[T1 , ..., Tm ]. The (T \u2212)equivariant quantum cohomology of the Grassmannian, denoted by QH \u2217T (X), is a deformation of both equivariant and quantum\ncohomology rings (for details on the latter cohomologies, see e.g. [21]). More precisely, QH \u2217T (X) is a graded, commutative, \u039b[q]\u2212algebra, where the degree of q\nis equal to m, which has a \u039b[q]\u2212basis {\u03c3\u03bb } indexed by the partitions \u03bb included\nin the p \u00d7 (m \u2212 p) rectangle. If \u03bb = (\u03bb1 , ..., \u03bbp ), the degree of \u03c3\u03bb is equal to\n|\u03bb| = \u03bb1 + ... + \u03bbp . The multiplication of two basis elements \u03c3\u03bb and \u03c3\u03bc is given by\nthe equivariant quantum Littlewood-Richardson (EQLR) coefficients c\u03bd,d\n\u03bb,\u03bc , where d\nis a nonnegative integer:\nXX\n\u03c3\u03bb \u25e6 \u03c3\u03bc =\nq d c\u03bd,d\n\u03bb,\u03bc \u03c3\u03bd .\nd\n\n\u03bd\n\nRecall that the EQLR coefficient c\u03bd,d\n\u03bb,\u03bc is a homogeneous polynomial in \u039b of polynomial degree |\u03bb| + |\u03bc| \u2212 |\u03bd| \u2212 md. If d = 0 one recovers the structure constant c\u03bd\u03bb,\u03bc in\nthe equivariant cohomology of X, and if the polynomial degree is equal to 0 (i.e. if\n|\u03bb| + |\u03bc| = |\u03bd| + md) the EQLR coefficient is equal to the ordinary 3\u2212pointed, genus\n0, Gromov-Witten invariant c\u03bd,d\n\u03bb,\u03bc . The latter is a nonnegative integer equal to the\nnumber of rational curves in X passing through general translates of the Schubert\nvarieties in X corresponding to the partitions \u03bb, \u03bc and the dual of \u03bd.\nThe geometric definition of these coefficients can be found in [21]. In fact, for\nthe purpose of this paper, the algebraic characterization of the equivariant quantum\ncohomology from Proposition 3.2 below (which has a geometric proof in loc. cit.),\nsuffices. We only remark that the equivariant quantum Schubert classes \u03c3\u03bb are\ndetermined by the equivariant Schubert classes \u03c3\u03bbT , determined in turn by the\nSchubert varieties in X defined with respect to the standard flag.2 The precise\ndefinition of \u03c3\u03bbT is not presently needed, but it is given in \u00a75, where the equivariant\ncohomology ring is discussed in more detail.\n2Unlike the case of classical cohomology, in equivariant cohomology the Schubert class determined by a Schubert variety \u03a9\u03bb (F\u2022 ), where F\u2022 is a fixed flag in Cm , depends on F\u2022 .\n\n\f8\n\nLEONARDO CONSTANTIN MIHALCEA\n\nFrom now on we specialize the sequence a = (ai )i\u2208Z from the previous section\nto one, denoted t = (ti )i\u2208Z , encoding the equivariant parameters Ti :\n\u001a\nTm\u2212i+1 if 1 6 i 6 m\nti =\n0\notherwise.\nUsing this sequence, we recall next the equivariant quantum Pieri-Chvalley rule, as\nproved in [21]. Given a partition \u03bb, we denote by \u03bb\u2212 the (uniquely determined)\npartition obtained by removing m \u2212 1 boxes from the border rim of \u03bb (recall that\nthe border rim of a Young diagram is the set of boxes that intersect the diagram's\nSE border - see also the figure below).\n\n\u03bb\u2212\n\n\u03bb\n\nFigure 1. Example: p = 3, m = 7, \u03bb = (4, 2, 1); \u03bb\u2212 = (1).\nIf \u03bb = (\u03bb1 , ..., \u03bbp ), note that \u03bb\u2212 exists only if \u03bb1 = m \u2212 p and \u03bbp > 0.\nProposition 3.1 (Equivariant quantum Pieri-Chvalley rule - cf. [21], Thm. 1).\nThe following formula holds in QH \u2217T (X):\nX\n\u03c3\u03bb \u25e6 \u03c3(1) =\n\u03c3\u03bc + c\u03bb\u03bb,(1) (t)\u03c3\u03bb + q\u03c3\u03bb\u2212\n\u03bc\u2192\u03bb\n\nwhere, by the formula (2.3),\n\nc\u03bb\u03bb,(1) (t)\n\nc\u03bb\u03bb,(1) (t)\n\n=\n\np\nX\n\nis equal to\n\nTm\u2212p+i\u2212\u03bbi \u2212\n\ni=1\n\nm\nX\n\nTj .\n\nj=m\u2212p+1\n\nThe last term is omitted if \u03bb\u2212 does not exist.\nIt turns out that the equivariant quantum Pieri-Chvalley rule determines completely the equivariant quantum cohomology algebra, in the following sense:\nProposition 3.2 ([21] Corollary 7.1). Let (A, \u22c4) be a graded, commutative, associative \u039b[q]\u2212algebra with unit such that:\n1. A has an additive \u039b[q]\u2212basis {s\u03bb } (graded as usual).\n2. The equivariant quantum Pieri-Chevalley rule holds, i.e.\nX\ns\u03bb \u22c4 s(1) =\ns\u03bc + c\u03bb\u03bb,(1) (t)s\u03bb + qs\u03bb\u2212\n\u03bc\u2192\u03bb\n\nwhere the last term is omitted if \u03bb\u2212 does not exist.\nThen A is canonically isomorphic to QH \u2217T (Gr(p, m)), as \u039b[q]\u2212algebras.\nThis proposition will be the main tool in proving the presentation and equivariant\nquantum Giambelli formula from the next section.\n\n\fGIAMBELLI FORMULAE FOR EQUIVARIANT QUANTUM COHOMOLOGY\n\n9\n\n4. Proof of the Theorem\nThe strategy for the proof is to \"guess\" candidates for the presentation and for\nthe polynomial representatives, using the insight provided by the similar results in\nquantum cohomology (see e.g. [3]) and some related results in equivariant cohomology ([16] \u00a76). Then one attempts to prove that the guessed polynomials form\na \u039b[q]\u2212basis in the candidate presentation, and they multiply according to the\nEQ Pieri-Chevalley rule. Proposition 3.2 will ensure that the guessed algebra will\nbe canonically isomorphic to QH \u2217T (X) and that the polynomials considered will\nrepresent the equivariant quantum Schubert classes.\nIt turns out that each of the quantum presentations from [3] (the usual one,\ninvolving the h variables, and the \"dual\" one, involving the variables e) implies an\nequivariant quantum presentation (see respectively Theorems 4.3 and 4.2 below).\nThe equivariant generalizations are obtained by taking the factorial versions, via\nthe factorial Jacobi-Trudi formula (\u00a72, property D) of all the expressions involved\nin the original quantum presentations.\nBefore stating the first result, we recall the notation from the introduction:\nh1 , ..., hm\u2212p and e1 , ..., ep denote two sets of indeterminates; the definitions of \u03c4 \u2212s hi ,\n\u03c4 s ej and of Hk (m \u2212 p < k 6 m) respectively Ek (p < k 6 m) are those given in\nthe equations (1.1),(1.2) and (1.5),(1.6) above. For \u03bb in the p \u00d7 (m \u2212 p) rectangle\nrecall that:\n(4.1)\n\ns\u03bb = det(\u03c4 1\u2212j h\u03bbi +j\u2212i )16i,j6p\n\nrespectively\n(4.2)\n\nse\u03bb = det(\u03c4 j\u22121 e\u03bb\u2032i +j\u2212i )16i,j6m\u2212p ,\n\n(cf. (1.3) and (1.4)) with the usual conventions that hk = 0 for k < 0 and k > m\u2212 p\nrespectively ei = 0 if i < 0 or i > p. Before proving the theorem, we need a\nNakayama-type result, which will be used several times in the paper:\nLemma 4.1 (cf. [8], Exerc. 4.6). Let M be an R\u2212algebra graded by nonnegative\nintegers. Assume that R is also graded (by nonnegative integers) and let I be a\nhomogeneous ideal in R consisting of elements of positive degree. Let m1 , ..., mk\nbe homogeneous elements whose images generate M/IM as an R/I-module. Then\nm1 , ..., mk generate M as an R\u2212module.\nProof. Let m be a nonzero homogeneous element of M . We use induction on its\ndegree. Assume deg m = 0. The hypothesis implies that\n(4.3)\n\nm = r1 m1 + ... + rk mk\n\nmod IM\n\nwhere ri are elements in R. Since I contains only elements of positive degree, it\nfollows that the equality holds in M as well. Let now deg m > 0. Writing m as in\n(4.3), implies that\nX\nX\naj m\u2032j\nri mi =\nm\u2212\nj\n\ni\n\nm\u2032j\n\n\u2208 M . Again, since I contains only elements\nfor some (finitely many) aj \u2208 I and\nof positive degree, deg m\u2032j < deg m for each j. The induction hypothesis implies\n\u0003\nthat each m\u2032j is an R\u2212combination of mi 's, which finishes the proof.\nWe prove next the \"dual version\" statement from the main theorem.\n\n\f10\n\nLEONARDO CONSTANTIN MIHALCEA\n\nTheorem 4.2. There exists a canonical isomorphism of \u039b[q]\u2212algebras\n\u039b[q][e1 , ..., ep ]/hHm\u2212p+1 , ..., Hm + (\u22121)p qi \u2212\u2192 QH \u2217T (X),\nsending ei to \u03c3(1)i and se\u03bb to the equivariant quantum Schubert class \u03c3\u03bb .\nProof. Note first that\n\nej (x|t) = ej (x) + f (t, x),\nwhere f (t, x) is a homogeneous polynomial in the variables x and t, but of degree\nin the variables x less than j. Since the usual elementary symmetric functions\ne1 (x), ..., ep (x) are algebraically independent over Z, it follows that the elementary\nfactorial Schur functions e1 (x|t), ..., ep (x|t) are algebraically independent over \u039b.\nThen there is a canonical isomorphism\n\u039b[q][e1 (x|t), ..., ep (x|t)] \u2192 \u039b[q][e1 , ..., ep ],\nsending s\u03bb (x|t) to se\u03bb , and hm\u2212p+i (x|t) (1 6 i 6 p) to Hm\u2212p+i , by the factorial\nJacobi-Trudi identity. This induces an isomorphism between\nA := \u039b[q][e1 (x|t), ..., ep (x|t)]/hhm\u2212p+1 (x|t), ..., hm (x|t) + (\u22121)p qi\n\nand\n\u039b[q][e1 , ..., ep ]/hHm\u2212p+1 , ..., Hm + (\u22121)p qi.\nBy Prop. 3.2, it remains to show that the images of s\u03bb (x|t) in A, as \u03bb varies over\nthe partitions included in the p\u00d7(m\u2212p) rectangle, form a \u039b[q]-basis of A, satisfying\nthe equivariant quantum Pieri-Chevalley rule.\nGenerating set. This follows from Lemma 4.1, applied to M = A, R = \u039b[q]\nand I the ideal generated by q and T1 , ..., Tp (in which case M/I is the classical\ncohomology of X).\nP d\u03bb\nLinear independence. Assume that\nq c\u03bb s\u03bb (x|t) = 0 in\nPA, for c\u03bb in \u039b, where\n\u03bb is included in the p\u00d7 (m\u2212 p) rectangle. This implies that q d\u03bb c\u03bb s\u03bb (x|t) is in the\nideal generated by hm\u2212p+1 (x|t), ..., hm (x|t) + (\u22121)p q. By Cor. 2.1 (1), any element\nof this ideal can be written as:\nX \u2032\nX \u2032\nq d\u03bc c\u2032\u03bc s\u03bc (x|t) +\nq d\u03bd c\u2032\u2032\u03bd s\u03bd (x|t)(hm (x|t) + (\u22121)p q)\n\u03bc\n\n\u03bd\n\nwhere \u03bc, \u03bd have at most p parts, \u03bc is outside the p\u00d7(m\u2212p) rectangle, and c\u2032\u03bc , c\u2032\u2032\u03bd are\nin \u039b. Note that s\u03bd (x|t)hm (x|t) expands also into a sum of factorial Schur functions\nindexed by partitions outside the p \u00d7 (m \u2212 p) rectangle. Since the factorial Schur\nfunctions form a \u039b[q]\u2212basis for the polynomials in \u039b[q][x1 , ..., xp ] symmetric in the\nx\u2212variables, it follows that all c\u03bb (and c\u2032\u03bc , c\u2032\u2032\u03bd ) must be equal to zero, as desired.\nEquivariant quantum Pieri-Chevalley. The factorial Pieri-Chevalley rule (\u00a72,\nProperty (C)) states that if \u03bb is included in the p \u00d7 (m \u2212 p) rectangle, then\nX\ns\u03bb (x|t) * s(1) (x|t) =\ns\u03bc (x|t) + c\u03bb(1),\u03bb (t)s\u03bb (x|t) + s\u03bb (x|t)\n\u03bc\n\nwhere \u03bc runs over all partitions in the p \u00d7 (m \u2212 p) obtained from \u03bb by adding one\nbox; the last term is omitted if \u03bb1 , the first part of \u03bb, is not equal to m \u2212 p. If\n\u03bb1 = m \u2212 p then \u03bb = (\u03bb1 , ..., \u03bbp ) is given by adding a box to the first row of \u03bb, i.e.\n\u03bb1 = m \u2212 p + 1 and \u03bbi = \u03bbi for i > 2. Since the images of s\u03bb (x|t), as \u03bb varies in\nthe p \u00d7 (m \u2212 p) rectangle, form a \u039b[q]\u2212basis for A, it is enough to show that\ns\u03bb (x|t) = qs\u03bb\u2212 (x|t)\n\nmod J\n\n\fGIAMBELLI FORMULAE FOR EQUIVARIANT QUANTUM COHOMOLOGY\n\n11\n\nwhere J is the ideal generated by hm\u2212p+1 (x|t), ..., hm (x|t)+(\u22121)p q.

Equation (2.6) implies that\nhj (x|\u03c4 \u2212s t) = hj (x|\u03c4 \u2212s+1 t) + (tj+p\u2212s \u2212 t\u2212s+1 )hj\u22121 (x|\u03c4 \u2212s+1 t),\nhence,\nhm\u2212p+i (x|\u03c4 1\u2212j t) = hm\u2212p+i (x|\u03c4 1\u2212(j\u22121) t)+(tm+1+i\u2212j \u2212t2\u2212j )hm\u2212p+i\u22121 (x|\u03c4 1\u2212(j\u22121) t).\nThe Claim follows then from the definition of (ti ), since tm+1+i\u2212j = t2\u2212j = 0.\n\n\u0003\n\nIt follows that for any integer 1 6 i 6 p,\nhm\u2212p+i (x|\u03c4 1\u2212i t) = hm\u2212p+i (x|t).\n\n(4.5)\nIn particular,\n\nhm\u2212p+i (x|\u03c4 1\u2212i t) = 0\n\nmod J\n\nif 1 6 i 6 p \u2212 1, and\nhm (x|\u03c4 1\u2212p t) = (\u22121)p+1 q\n\nmod J.\n\nTherefore, expanding the determinant in (4.4) after the first row, yields:\n(4.6)\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\nh\u03bb2 \u22121 (x|t) h\u03bb2 (x|\u03c4 \u22121 t) . . . h\u03bb2 +p\u22123 (x|\u03c4 2\u2212p t)\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n..\n..\n..\n..\ns\u03bb (x|t) = (\u22121)p+1 (\u22121)p+1 q det \uf8ed\n\uf8f8\n.\n.\n.\n.\n...\n\n...\n\n...\n\nh\u03bbp \u22121 (x|\u03c4 2\u2212p t)\n\nin A. If \u03bbp = 0, the last row of the determinant in (4.6) contains only zeroes; if \u03bbp >\n0, the determinant is equal to s\u03bb\u2212 (x|t), by the Jacobi-Trudi formula. Summarizing,\ns\u03bb (x|t) is equal to qs\u03bb\u2212 (x|t) in A, or it is equal to zero if \u03bb\u2212 does not exists. This\nfinishes the proof of the equivariant quantum Pieri-Chevalley rule, hence also the\nproof of the theorem.\n\u0003\nWe are ready to prove the first part of the main result, which involves the h\nvariables.

Consider the \u039b[q]\u2212algebra morphism\n\u03a8 : \u039b[q][h1 , ..., hm\u2212p ] \u2192 \u039b[q][e1 (x|t), ..., ep (x|t)]/hhm\u2212p+1 (x|t), ..., hm (x|t)+(\u22121)p qi\nsending hk to the image of hk (x|t) = det(e1+j\u2212i (x|\u03c4 1\u2212j t))16i,j6k . Recall that the\nlast quotient is denoted by A and it is canonically isomorphic to QH \u2217T (X), by the\nprevious proof. We will show that the images under \u03a8 of Ep+1 , Ep+2 , ..., Em\u22121 , Em +\n(\u22121)m\u2212p q are equal to zero in A (where Ei is defined by equation (1.6)). First, we\nneed the following claim:\nClaim. The following formulae hold in A:\n(4.7)\n\n\u03a8(\u03c4 \u2212s hj ) = hj (x|\u03c4 \u2212s t),\n\nfor any nonnegative integers s and j with j < m, and\n(4.8)\n\n\u03a8(\u03c4 \u2212(m\u22121) hm ) = hm (x|\u03c4 \u2212(m\u22121) t) + (\u22121)p q.\n\nProof of the Claim. By definition, both \u03c4 \u2212s hj and hj (x|\u03c4 \u2212s t) satisfy the same recurrence relations (given respectively by the equations (1.1) and (2.6)). This implies\nthat there exist polynomials P1 (t), ..., Ps (t) in \u039b, with deg Pk (t) = k, such that\n\u03c4 \u2212s hj = hj +\n\ns\nX\n\nPk (t)hj\u2212k ,\n\nk=1\n\nrespectively\n(4.9)\n\ns\nX\n\nhj (x|\u03c4 \u2212s t) = hj (x|t) +\n\nPk (t)hj\u2212k (x|t).\n\nk=1\n\nIf j 6 m \u2212 p, then \u03a8(hj ) = hj (x|t) in A, by the definition of \u03a8, thus\n(4.10)\n\n\u03a8(\u03c4 \u2212s hj ) = hj (x|\u03c4 \u2212s t).\n\nIf m \u2212 p + 1 6 j < m, hj = 0 by convention, whereas hj (x|t) = 0 in A, so equation\n(4.10) also holds in this case. If s = m \u2212 1 and j = m, we have\n\u03a8(\u03c4 \u2212(m\u22121) hm ) = \u03a8(hm +\n\nm\u22121\nX\n\nPk (t)hm\u2212k )\n\nk=1\n\n= \u03a8(hm ) +\n\nm\u22121\nX\n\nPk (t)\u03a8(hm\u2212k )\n\nk=1\n\n= hm (x|t) + (\u22121)p q +\n\nm\u22121\nX\n\nPk (t)hm\u2212k (x|t)\n\nk=1\np\n\n= hm (x|\u03c4 \u2212(m\u22121) t) + (\u22121) q,\nwhere the third equality follows from the fact that hm = 0 and hm (x|t)+(\u22121)p q = 0\nin A; the fourth equality follows from the expansion (4.9) of hm (x|\u03c4 \u2212(m\u22121) t). \u0003\nBy definition, \u03a8(Ei ) is equal\n\uf8eb\nh1 \u03c4 \u22121 h2\n\uf8ec 1 \u03c4 \u22121 h1\n\uf8ec\ndet \uf8ec .\n..\n\uf8ed ..\n.\n0\n...\n\nto the image in A, through \u03a8, of\n\uf8f6\n... \u03c4 \u2212(s\u22121) hs ...\n\u03c4 \u2212(i\u22121) hi\n...\n...\n... \u03c4 \u2212(i\u22121) hi\u22121 \uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7.\n..\n..\n..\n..\n\uf8f8\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\u2212(i\u22121)\n...\n0\n1\n\u03c4\nh1\n\n\fGIAMBELLI FORMULAE FOR EQUIVARIANT QUANTUM COHOMOLOGY\n\n13\n\nIf p + 1 6 i < m, this determinant contains only \u03c4 \u2212s hj with j < m.

To compute the image\nof \u03a8(Em ) we use both the equations (4.7) and (4.8). Then \u03a8(Em ) is equal to the\nimage in A of\n\uf8eb\nh1 (x|t)\n\uf8ec ..\ndet \uf8ed .\n\n\uf8f6\nh2 (x|\u03c4 \u22121 t) ... hs (x|\u03c4 \u2212(s\u22121) t) ... hm (x|\u03c4 \u2212(m\u22121) t)\n\uf8f7\n..\n..\n..\n..\n..\n\uf8f8+\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\u2212(m\u22121)\n0\n...\n0\n1 h1 (x|\u03c4 \uf8f6\nt)\n\uf8eb ...\n0\n0\n... 0\n(\u22121)p q\n\uf8ec1 h1 (x|\u03c4 \u22121 t) ... ... hm\u22121 (x|\u03c4 \u2212(m\u22121) t)\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\ndet \uf8ec .\n\uf8f7\n..\n..\n..\n..\n\uf8f8\n\uf8ed ..\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\u2212(m\u22121)\n0\n...\n0 1\nh1 (x|\u03c4\nt)\n\nThe first determinant is equal to zero, by Prop. 2.4, and the second is (\u22121)m+1 *\n(\u22121)p q. It follows that \u03a8(Em ) + (\u22121)m\u2212p q is equal to zero in A, as claimed. Thus\n\u03a8 induces a \u039b[q]\u2212algebra morphism\n\u03a8\u2032 : \u039b[q][h1 , ..., hm\u2212p ]/hEp+1 , ...., Em + (\u22121)m\u2212p qi \u2212\u2192 A.\nNote that \u03c4 \u2212s hm does not appear in the determinant defining s\u03bb , for any \u03bb in\nthe p \u00d7 (m \u2212 p) rectangle, so \u03a8\u2032 sends s\u03bb to the image of s\u03bb (x|t) in A. Applying Lemma 4.1 with M = \u039b[q][h1 , ..., hm\u2212p ]/hEp+1 , ...., Em + (\u22121)m\u2212p qi and I\nthe ideal generated by q and T1 , ..., Tm implies that the polynomials s\u03bb generate\n\u039b[q][h1 , ..., hm\u2212p ]/hEp+1 , ...., Em + (\u22121)m\u2212p qi as a \u039b[q]-module. Since their images\nthrough \u03a8\u2032 form a \u039b[q]\u2212basis, they must form a \u039b[q]\u2212basis, as well. Hence \u03a8\u2032 is\nan isomorphism, as desired.\n\u0003\nRemark: The Theorems 4.2 and 4.3 are proved without using the corresponding results from quantum cohomology. In particular, we obtain a new proof for\nBertram's quantum Giambelli formula (see [2]). (Recall that the quantum cohomology ring of X is a graded Z[q]\u2212algebra isomorphic to QH \u2217T (X)/(T1 , ..., Tm ),\nhence the quantum Giambelli formula is obtained by taking T1 = ... = Tm = 0 in\nthe determinants from the above-mentioned theorems.)\n5. Giambelli formulae in equivariant cohomology\nThe goal of this section is to state the equivariant Giambelli formulae implied by\ntheir equivariant quantum counterparts from the previous section. We will also use\nthis opportunity to define rigourously the equivariant Schubert classes involved, and\nprovide, without proof, a geometric interpretation for the factorial Schur functions.\nLet T be the usual torus, and let ET \u2192 BT be the universal T \u2212bundle. If X is a\ntopological space with a T \u2212action, there is an induced T \u2212action on ET \u00d7 X given\nby t * (e, x) = (et\u22121 , tx). The (topological) quotient space (ET \u00d7 X)/T is denoted\nby XT . By definition, the (T \u2212)equivariant cohomology of X, denoted HT\u2217 (X), is\n\n\f14\n\nLEONARDO CONSTANTIN MIHALCEA\n\nequal to the usual cohomology of XT . The X\u2212bundle XT \u2192 BT gives HT\u2217 (X) the\nstructure of a \u039b\u2212algebra, where \u039b denotes the equivariant cohomology of a point\nHT\u2217 (pt) = H \u2217 (BT ).\nLet now X be the Grassmannian of subspaces of dimension p in Cm with the\nT \u2212action induced from the usual GL(m)\u2212action. We define next the equivariant Schubert classes which determine the equivariant quantum classes \u03c3\u03bb used in\nprevious sections (see also [21]). Let\nF\u2022 : (0) \u2282 F1 \u2282 ... \u2282 Fm = Cm\nbe the standard flag, so Fi = hf1 , ..., fi i and fi = (0, ..., 1, ..., 0) (with 1 in the i\u2212th\nposition). If \u03bb = (\u03bb1 , ..., \u03bbp ) is a partition included in the p \u00d7 (m \u2212 p) rectangle,\ndefine the Schubert variety \u03a9\u03bb (F\u2022 ) by\n(5.1)\n\n\u03a9\u03bb (F\u2022 ) = {V \u2208 X : dim V \u2229 Fm\u2212p+i\u2212\u03bbi > i}.\n\nSince the flag F\u2022 is T -invariant, the Schubert variety \u03a9\u03bb (F\u2022 ) will be T \u2212invariant\n2|\u03bb|\nas well, so it determines a Schubert class \u03c3\u03bbT in HT (X). The following result\nis a consequence of the Theorems 4.2 and 4.3 (the notation is from the previous\nsection):\nCorollary 5.1. (a) There exists a canonical isomorphism of \u039b\u2212algebras\n\u039b[h1 , ..., hm\u2212p ]/hEp+1 , ...., Em i \u2212\u2192 HT\u2217 (X),\nT\nand s\u03bb is the equivariant Schubert class \u03c3\u03bbT .\nsending hj to \u03c3(j)\n(b) There exists a canonical isomorphism of \u039b\u2212algebras\n\n\u039b[e1 , ..., ep ]/hHm\u2212p+1 , ..., Hm i \u2212\u2192 HT\u2217 (X),\nT\nsending ei to \u03c3(1)\ne\u03bb to the equivariant Schubert class \u03c3\u03bbT .\ni and s\n\nProof. It is known (see e.g. [21]) that there is a canonical isomorphism of \u039b\u2212algebras\nQH \u2217T (X)/hqi \u2212\u2192 HT\u2217 (X)\n\nsending the equivariant quantum Schubert class \u03c3\u03bb from the previous section to\n\u03c3\u03bbT . Then the Corollary follows from the Theorems 4.2 and 4.3.\n\u0003\nRemarks: 1. The proof of the Corollary can be given without using the equivariant quantum cohomology. There is an analogue of Prop. 3.2, stating that\nthe Pieri-Chevalley rule determines the equivariant cohomology algebra. Then a\n\"strictly equivariant\" proof of Cor. 5.1 can be obtained by taking q = 0 in all the\nassertions from the previous section.\n2. The fact that the factorial Schur functions represent the equivariant Schubert\nclasses can be also be deduced, indirectly, by combining the fact that the double\nSchubert polynomials represent the equivariant Schubert classes in the complete flag\nvariety (cf. [5] and [1]) and that, when indexed by a Grassmannian permutation,\nthese polynomials are actually factorial Schur functions. The latter holds because\nthe vanishing property characterizing the factorial Schur functions (\u00a72, property\n(B)), is also satisfied by the double Schubert polynomials in question (see [18], pag.\n33). However, the details of this connection are missing from the literature.\n3. It is well known that the equivariant Schubert classes are determined by their\nrestriction to the torus fixed points in X. Formulae for such restrictions have been\nobtained by A. Knutson - T. Tao in [16] and, recently, by V. Lakshmibai - K.N.\nRaghavan - P. Sankaran in [17].\n\n\fGIAMBELLI FORMULAE FOR EQUIVARIANT QUANTUM COHOMOLOGY\n\n15\n\n5.1. A geometric interpretation of the factorial Schur functions. Consider\nthe tautological short exact sequence on X:\n(5.2)\n\n0 \u2212\u2192 S \u2212\u2192 V \u2212\u2192 Q \u2212\u2192 0,\n\nwhich is clearly T \u2212equivariant. Let \u2212x1 , ..., \u2212xp be the equivariant Chern roots\nof the bundle S. There is a weight space decomposition of the trivial (but not\nequivariantly trivial) vector bundle V into a sum of T \u2212equivariant line bundles:\nV = L1 \u2295 ... \u2295 Lm .\nLet \u2212Ti be the equivariant first Chern class of Li .3 Define the sequence (ti ) as\nusual, using the formula from \u00a71.1.\nProposition 5.2. In HT\u2217 (X), the equivariant Schubert class \u03c3\u03bbT is equal to the\nfactorial Schur polynomial s\u03bb (x|t).\nIdea of proof. The equivariant Schubert class \u03c3\u03bbT is a cohomology class on the infinite dimensional space XT . The first step of the proof is to approximate this class by\na class (\u03c3\u03bb )T,n on a finite-dimensional \"approximation\" XT,n (n \u226b 0) of XT . This\nis standard (see e.g. [6] or [21]) and uses the T \u2212bundle (Cn+1 \\ 0)m \u2192 (Pn )m which\napproximates the universal T \u2212bundle ET \u2192 BT . Then XT,n := (ETn \u00d7 X)/T\u0001,\nwhich, in fact, is equal to the Grassmann bundle G p, O(1) (\u22121) \u2295 ... \u2295 O(m) (\u22121) ,\nwhere O(i) (\u22121) denotes the tautological line bundle over the i\u2212th component of\n(Pn )m . Using this procedure one obtains the class (\u03c3\u03bb )T,n as the cohomology class\ndetermined by the subvariety (\u03a9\u03bb )T,n of XT,n . The second step is to use the definition of (\u03a9\u03bb )T,n to realize it as the degeneracy locus from [9], Thm. 14.3, whose\ncohomology class is given as a certain determinantal formula in the Chern classes\nof the vector bundles ST,n , VT,n and QT,n on XT,n induced by the tautological sequence on X. Finally, one proves that the determinant in question is equal to the\nclaimed factorial Schur polynomial, which ends the proof.\n\u0003\nReferences\n[1] A. Arabia.
