Connecting many of these junctions,\nstring network can be constructed [4]. When the whole network is stabilized within a twodimensional plane, the network as a whole was also shown to be a quarter BPS state [4].\nProtected by these remaining supersymmetries, there exist rigid zero modes of string network\n[5, 6]. They are roughly the modes changing the sizes of each loop and can even reconnect the\nstrings to change the topology of a network. Since these zero modes exist locally in a string\nnetwork, it is generally an object which can have a macroscopic entropy [7]. In this paper,\nwe will continue pursuing the possibility whether a string lattice can be regarded as a kind\nof continuous space in the low energy limit [8], like in lattice gauge theory. This way of view\nmight be similar in spirit to the idea of brane world [9, 10] and also to the network appearing\nin quantum gravity [11, 12, 13, 14, 15].\nA main question in regarding a string lattice as a continuous space is what is the low energy\ndynamics on it. The dynamics of a string network was analyzed in the small oscillation limit\nin [16, 17], and a general framework for studying the moduli space of the above mentioned\nzero modes was recently given in [18]. The question of what kind of field theory is on a string\nlattice was studied in our previous paper [8] for the case of a regular hexagonal lattice. There\nthe oscillations of a string lattice is approximated by the oscillations of junctions between\nwhich there are straight strings. This approximation of straight strings would be valid when\nthe motions of the string junctions are much slower than the motions of the oscillations on the\nstrings. Our main interest was that, since the zero modes exist locally in the network, they\nmay appear as a local gauge symmetry in the low energy effective field theory. In fact, we\nhave obtained the result that the oscillation mode tangent to the network plane is described\nby Maxwell theory, the gauge symmetry of which comes from these zero modes. As for the\noscillations transverse to the network plane, we have obtained a scalar field theory with seven\nscalars.\nThe low energy supersymmetries of the effective field theory give a good relation between\nthe Maxwell and the scalar modes. From the supergravity argument of [4], the eight supersymmetries remaining on the network are in the spinor representation 8 of the SO(7) symmetry\nwhich is the rotation among the directions transverse to the network. In [17], the eight supersymmetries were identified from the world sheet view point. There are one supersymmetry\nfor each of the seven transverse directions and another for the mode along the network. Thus\n1\n\n\fthe remaining supersymmetries and the SO(7) symmetry should mix up the scalar fields and\nthe Maxwell field.\nThe approximate treatment in our previous paper [8] can be well controlled by assigning a\npoint-like mass to each junction. If we take the mass sufficiently large, the oscillations of the\njunctions will become sufficiently slower than the string oscillations, which will validate our\napproximation. However, in the limit of vanishing mass, which is the case we are interested\nin, we cannot fully believe the validity of our approximation.\nIn this paper we will instead use the method developed in [17] to investigate the low\nenergy dynamics of a periodic string lattice, and will generalize our previous results [8]. In\nsection 2, we will recapitulate and discuss some properties of the scattering matrix associated\nto junctions and the low energy oscillation modes on a string lattice. We will show that the\ngauge symmetry is a general feature of a string lattice made of three-string junctions, but not\nof one made of higher order junctions. In section 3, we will extract the low energy geometry by\nstudying the energy-momentum relation of the low energy propagation modes. The geometry\nis identical for both the tangent and transverse modes, so that one geometry can be assigned\nto a string lattice. It is also shown to be consistent with the gauge symmetry. In section 4, we\nwill discuss the low energy effective field theory and its supersymmetry. Section 5 is devoted\nfor summary and discussions.\n\n2\n\nThe gauge symmetry\n\nIn this paper we will use the approach to the dynamics of the small oscillations of string\njunction which was developed in [17]. Their approach is to relate the in-wave and out-wave\nat a string junction by a matrix to characterize the dynamics of the string junction. In their\nsmall oscillation limit, the dynamics is independent for the mode in each of the directions\ntransverse to the junction plane (out-plane) and the mode along the junction plane (in-plane).\nLet us consider the fluctuations \u03c6i (xi , t) on a string in one of those independent directions,\nwhere i (i = 1, * * * , N) is the index for the strings forming an N-order string junction. The\n\noscillation on a string can be written as\n\n\u03c6i (xi , t) = Re{(Ai exp(i\u03c9xi ) + Bi exp(\u2212i\u03c9xi )) exp(\u2212i\u03c9t)},\n\n(1)\n\nwhere Ai , Bi are the complex mode amplitudes of out-wave and in-wave, respectively, and\nxi > 0 is the distance from the junction measured along the i-th string. The oscillations\n2\n\n\fslightly deform the configuration of the strings near the string junction so that they satisfy\nthe following two physical matching conditions at the junction. One is the continuity condition\nthat the strings should meet at one point, and the other is the tension balance condition that\nthe forces from the string tensions pulling the junction should add up to vanish. From these\n~ = S B,\n~\nconditions they determined the matrix relating the in-wave and out-wave amplitudes, A\nfor a general N-order string junction. In the case of a three-string junction (N = 3), the matrix\nS is given by\nSout-plane\n\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8f6\nt1 t2 t3\n2\n\uf8ed t1 t2 t3 \uf8f8\n= \u22121 + P3\nt\ni\ni=1\nt1 t2 t3\n\nfor an out-plane scattering, and, for an in-plane scattering,\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\nt2 t3 sin2 \u03b823\nt2 t3 sin \u03b823 sin \u03b831 t2 t3 sin \u03b823 sin \u03b812\n2\nt1 t3 sin2 \u03b831\nt1 t3 sin \u03b831 sin \u03b812 \uf8f8 ,\nSin-plane = 1 \u2212 \uf8ed t1 t3 sin \u03b831 sin \u03b823\nD\nt1 t2 sin \u03b812 sin \u03b823 t1 t2 sin \u03b812 sin \u03b831\nt1 t2 sin2 \u03b812\n\n(2)\n\n(3)\n\nwhere ti 's and \u03b8ij 's are the string tensions and the angles between the string i and j, respectively, and D = t1 t2 sin2 \u03b812 + t2 t3 sin2 \u03b823 + t3 t1 sin2 \u03b831 .\nA fairly convenient coordinate can be taken for these matrices [17]. After a similarity\n\u221a \u221a \u22121\ntransformation, \u015c = tS t , where t is a diagonal matrix whose entries are the tensions,\nthey found\n\u015cout-plane = \u22121 + 2~y \u2297 ~y ,\nwhere ~y is a unit vector\n\nand\n\nwhere ~z is a unit vector\n\n\u221a \u221a \u221a\n1\n~y = pP ( t1 , t2 , t3 ),\nti\n\n(4)\n\n(5)\n\n\u015cin-plane = 1 \u2212 2~z \u2297 ~z ,\n\n(6)\n\n\u221a\n\u221a\n1 \u221a\n~z = \u221a ( \u03c423 , \u03c431 , \u03c412 )\nD\n\n(7)\n\nwith \u03c4ij = ti tj sin2 \u03b8ij . The eigenvalues of these matrices are (1, \u22121, \u22121) and (1, 1, \u22121), respec-\n\ntively, and the eigenvalues 1 and -1 correspond to Neumann and Dirichlet boundary conditions\ngeneralized to a junction formed by strings with arbitrary tensions, respectively.\nAlthough they did not mention explicitly in their paper, the vectors ~y and ~z are the same.\nThis can be shown from the relations among the angles \u03b8ij and the tensions ti . Due to the\n\n3\n\n\ftension balance condition, the angles \u03c0 \u2212 \u03b8ij and the tensions ti are in fact the angles and the\n\nedge lengths of a closed triangle, respectively, and so they should satisfy\nt1\nt2\nt3\n=\n=\n.\nsin \u03b823\nsin \u03b831\nsin \u03b812\n\n(8)\n\n(\u03c423 , \u03c431 , \u03c412 ) = C(t1 , t2 , t3 ),\n\n(9)\n\nFrom these equations we obtain\n\nwhere C is an unimportant positive factor. Thus we obtain\n~y = ~z.\n\n(10)\n\nThis gives a simple relation between the out-plane and in-plane scattering matrices:\nSout-plane = \u2212Sin-plane .\n\n(11)\n\nAs we will see, because of this relation, the spectra of the oscillation modes on a periodic string\nlattice in the tangent and transverse directions are basically the same, and this is consistent\nwith the discussions about the remaining supersymmetries in Sec.1.\nAs for a higher order string junction, the eigenvalues of the scattering matrices are (1, \u22121, * * * , \u22121)\n\nand (1, 1, \u22121, * * * , \u22121) for out-plane and in-plane, respectively [17]. Hence we can not expect\n\na simple relation like (11) to hold between the two kinds of scattering matrices in this case.\nThus, when a string lattice is made of higher order junctions, it is obscure how the low energy field theory respects the eight remaining supersymmetries expected from the supergravity\nargument.\nThe spectra of the oscillations on an infinite periodic string lattice can be analyzed by\n\nusing the scattering matrices. The case that a string lattice is given by a periodic connection\nof one kind of three-string junction was analyzed in [17]. The basic equations are given by\n~ = S B,\n~\nA\n~ = S P\u2217 \u03b1 A\n~\nP \u03b1B\n\n(12)\n\nwhere S is Sout-plane or Sin-plane for the out-plane or in-plane modes, respectively. Here P =\ndiag(exp(\u2212i\u03c9l1 ), exp(\u2212i\u03c9l2 ), exp(\u2212i\u03c9l3 )) is a diagonal matrix accounting for the phase shifts\nat the other ends of each string with length li forming a three-string junction, and \u03b1 =\ndiag(exp(i\u03b11 ), exp(i\u03b12 ), exp(i\u03b13 )) is a diagonal matrix of the phase shifts associated to the\n4\n\n\fdiscrete translation symmetries of the periodic lattice. The momenta of the oscillation modes\nare related to \u03b1 by\n\u03b1i = ~li * (p1 , p2 ),\n\n(13)\n\nwhere ~li denote the vectors in the two-dimensional lattice plane with the directions and lengths\nof the strings starting from the junction point, and * is the inner product between vectors on\n\nthe plane. The mode spectra, which give relations between \u03c9 and (p1 , p2 ), can be determined\n~ B.\n~ Because\nby analyzing the condition that the equations (12) have nontrivial solutions for A,\nof (11), the problem is basically equivalent for the out-plane and in-plane cases.\n\nAs was noticed in [17], there is a special solution to the equations (12). This solution exists\nfor any momenta (p1 , p2 ) without any cost of energy: \u03c9 = 0. These modes were identified\nas the gauge symmetry of the low energy effective action in our previous paper [8]. The\nreason for this identification is that this fact shows that these modes are the time-independent\nlocal deformations of the string lattice configuration under which the potential energy remains\nunchanged. Let us look into the modes in more detail by solving (12) for P = 1 (\u03c9 = 0).\nSince \u03b1 is commutative with the tension matrix t, the problem of solving (12) is easier after\n\u221a\n~ we obtain\nthe similarity transformation by t. Then, by eliminating B,\n~\n~\n\u00c2 = \u015cin-plane \u015c\u03b1 \u00c2,\n\n(14)\n\n\u015c\u03b1 = 1 \u2212 2(\u03b1~y )\u2217 \u2297 (\u03b1~y ).\n\n(15)\n\n~\n\u00c2gauge = (\u03b1~y) \u00d7 ~y ,\n\n(16)\n\nwhere\n~\nThus the solution to (14) for \u00c2 is given explicitly by a vector orthogonal both to ~y and \u03b1~y :\n\nwhere \u00d7 denotes an external product in the three-dimensional string index space. As we\n\nmentioned, the equations for the oscillation spectra are basically equivalent for the out-plane\nand in-plane, but the physical spectra are different. From (1), for \u03c9 = 0, the physical quantities\n~ + B)\n~ out-plane = (1 \u2212 Sin-plane )A\n~ and (A\n~ + B)\n~ in-plane = (1 + Sin-plane )A\n~ for the out-plane\nare (A\n~\n~\nand in-plane, respectively. Since the solution satisfies \u015cin-plane \u00c2gauge = \u00c2gauge , the gauge mode\n~\n\u00c2gauge does not exist as an out-plane mode, while it does as an in-plane mode. This makes\na difference between the low energy effective field theories for the oscillations transverse and\ntangent to the lattice plane.\nAs for a higher order junction (N \u2265 4), the existence of the gauge mode is not expected.\n\nThis can be shown as follows. From the analysis of [17], the rescaled matrix of the in-plane\n5\n\n\fscattering matrix for an N-string junction, \u015cin-plane =\n\u015cin-plane = 1 \u2212 2\n\nN\n\u22122\nX\ni=1\n\n\u221a\n\n\u221a \u22121\ntSin-plane t , should have the from\n\n~zi \u2297 ~zi ,\n\n(17)\n\nwhere ~zi 's are orthogonal unit vectors. By a similar argument as above, in this N-junction\ncase,\n\u015c\u03b1 = 1 \u2212 2\n\nN\n\u22122\nX\ni=1\n\n(\u03b1~zi )\u2217 \u2297 (\u03b1~zi ).\n\n(18)\n\nSince there does not seem to exist any necessity for the vectors {~zi , \u03b1~zi } to degenerate to less\n\nthan N-dimensions, we do not expect that there exists a vector orthogonal to all {~zi , \u03b1~zi } for\n\nN \u2265 4. This fact can be explicitly checked for some simple examples. This is consistent with\n\nthe argument that the gauge symmetry comes from the zero modes of changing the sizes of\neach loop of a network [8]. We cannot change the size of a loop without changing the sizes\nof the other neighboring loops when higher-order junctions are forming the loop. Thus we do\nnot obtain local zero modes in such a case.\n\n3\n\nGeometry on string lattice\n\nAs for the interest in the possibility to regard a string lattice as a continuous space manifold in\nthe low energy limit, it would be interesting to investigate the effective low energy geometry on\na string lattice. This will be extracted from the relations between the energy and momentum\nP\nof the low-energy propagation modes, \u03c9 2 = 2m,n=1 g mn pm pn .\nThe condition for the equations (12) to have non-trivial solutions was obtained in [17]:\n0 = (\n\n3\nX\ni=1\n\nt2i )s1 s2 s3 + 2t1 t2 s3 (cos(\u03b11 \u2212 \u03b12 ) \u2212 c1 c2 ) + 2t2 t3 s1 (cos(\u03b12 \u2212 \u03b13 ) \u2212 c2 c3 )\n+2t3 t1 s2 (cos(\u03b13 \u2212 \u03b11 ) \u2212 c3 c1 ),\n\n(19)\n\nwhere si = sin(\u03c9li ), ci = cos(\u03c9li ). As we have discussed in the previous section, there is a\nrather trivial solution with \u03c9 = 0 for any given (p1 , p2 ). In addition, there exists another low\nenergy solution in (19). This is the low energy propagation mode which we are interested in\nin this section. Expanding (19) in the cubic orders of \u03c9 and the quadratic orders of \u03b1i , we\nobtain\n\u03c92 =\n\n1\n(t1 t2 l3 (\u03b11 \u2212 \u03b12 )2 + t2 t3 l1 (\u03b12 \u2212 \u03b13 )2 + t3 t1 l2 (\u03b13 \u2212 \u03b11 )2 ),\nL\n6\n\n(20)\n\n\fwhere\nL = (t1 l2 l3 + t2 l3 l1 + t3 l1 l2 )(l1 t1 + l2 t2 + l3 t3 ).\n\n(21)\n\nThus, substituting this with (13), the two-dimensional metric tensor is obtained as\ng\n\nmn\n\n3\n1 X\nti tj lk (~li \u2212 ~lj )m (~li \u2212 ~lj )n .\n=\nL i<j,k6=i,j\n\n(22)\n\nA more convenient expression of the metric tensor can be obtained as follows. Let us pick\nup the terms with the form ~l1 \u2297 * * * in the numerator of the metric tensor (22):\n~l1 \u2297 (t1 t2 l3 (~l1 \u2212 ~l2 ) \u2212 t3 t1 l2 (~l3 \u2212 ~l1 )).\n\n(23)\n\nLet us define the tension vectors in the two-dimensional lattice plane by ~ti = (ti /li )~li (no sum).\nFrom the tension balance condition, these vectors satisfy\n3\nX\n\n~ti = 0.\n\n(24)\n\ni=1\n\nSubstituting ~li with ~ti in (23) and using (24), we obtain\n(t1 l2 l3 + t2 l3 l1 + t3 l1 l2 ) ~l1 \u2297 ~t1 .\n\n(25)\n\nThus another equivalent expression for the metric tensor is given by\ng\n\nmn\n\nP3 ~ m n\n(li ) (~ti )\n= i=1\n.\nP3\ni=1 li ti\n\n(26)\n\nThis expression clearly shows that, for any momentum (p1 , p2 ), the inequality \u03c9 2 = g mn pm pn <\nP2\nn=1 pn pn holds. This means that the velocity of the low energy propagation mode is always\nsmaller than the light velocity for an observer in the target space.\n\nNow let us study the polarization of the gauge symmetry obtained in the previous section.\nSince the definition of the momentum (13) is through the inner product with variables in the\ntarget space, the momentum has a contravariant index, while the polarization of the gauge\nsymmetry has a covariant index since the field \u03c6 of (1) denotes string motions in the target\nspace. Thus we need the metric tensor to see the relation between the momentum and the\npolarization. We will show below that the polarization is certainly parallel to the momentum\nwhen we take into account the metric (26) (or (22)).\n\n7\n\n\fFrom the result (16), in the first order of the momentum, the in-wave amplitude of the\ngauge symmetry is given by\n\u221a \u22121\n(A1 , A2 , A3 )gauge = \u0010 t (\u00c21 , \u00c22 , \u00c23 )gauge\n\u0011\np\np\np\n=\nt2 t3 /t1 (~l2 \u2212 ~l3 ) * p~, t3 t1 /t2 (~l3 \u2212 ~l1 ) * ~p, t1 t2 /t3 (~l1 \u2212 ~l2 ) * p~ (27)\n~ B\n~ = 2A\n~ in this case, (27) represents the physical\nup to an unimportant all over factor. Since A+\npolarization. To extract the two-dimensional in-plane polarization vector from the data (27),\nwe will proceed as follows. Let us denote the corresponding two-dimensional polarization\nP3\n~ 1\nvector by \u03c6\n~ gauge , and suppose it is expanded by the tension vectors: \u03c6\n~ gauge =\ni=1 \u03c6i ti .\nThen, since Ai denote the fluctuations transverse to each string i, we have\nAi = \u03c6\n~ gauge * R(~ti )/ti\n3\nX\n\u03c6j~tj * R(~ti )/ti\n=\nj=1\n\n=\n\n3\nX\n\n\u03c6j tj sin(\u03b8ij ),\n\n(28)\n\nj=1\n\nwhere R(*) denotes a two-dimensional rotation operator of degree \u03c0/2. Thus, using (8) and\nsetting T = t1 / sin(\u03b823 ) = * * *, we obtain\n(t1 A1 , t2 A2 , t3 A3 ) =\n\nt1 t2 t3\n(1, 1, 1) \u00d7 (\u03c61 , \u03c62 , \u03c63 ).\nT\n\n(29)\n\nT\n(l1 * p, l2 * p, l3 * p).\nt1 t2 t3\n\n(30)\n\nComparing with the data (27), we obtain\n(\u03c61 , \u03c62 , \u03c63 ) = \u221a\nThus we finally obtain the desired result\n(~\n\u03c6gauge )\n\nm\n\n3\nX\nT\n= \u221a\n(~ti )m (~li * p)\nt1 t2 t3 i=1\n= Cg mn pn ,\n\n(31)\n\nwhere C is an unimportant factor.\nP3\nSince i=1 ~ti = 0, this is a degenerate expression. In general this expansion will not work well, but for\nour present purpose, this coordinate will turn out to be very convenient.\n1\n\n8\n\n\f4\n\nEffective field theory and supersymmetry\n\nLet us first discuss the effective action for one of the oscillations transverse to the network\nplane. In the small oscillation limit, the kinetic term of the effective action should be well\napproximated by\nK=\n\n\u0012\n\u00132\nd\u03c6j\nm X\n,\ndt\n2 j=junction dt\n\nZ\n\n(32)\n\nwhere m = (l1 t1 + l2 t2 + l3 t3 )/2 denotes the mass per junction, and \u03c6j is the oscillation of a\njunction j. The action per junction may be smeared on the two-dimensional lattice plane, and\nwe may introduce a coordinate (z1 , z2 ), which is just the target space coordinate restricted on\nthe lattice plane, to parameterize the collective field for the transverse oscillation. Then (32)\nwill be rewritten in the form\nKcol =\n\nZ\n\nm\ndtd z\n2s\n2\n\n\u0012\n\nd\u03c6col\ndt\n\n\u00132\n\n,\n\n(33)\n\nwhere s is the area per vertex, and is explicitly given by\n\u221a\nq\n(l1 l2 t3 + l2 l3 t1 + l3 l1 t2 ),\ns =\n4t1 t2 t3\nq = (t1 + t2 + t3 )(t1 + t2 \u2212 t3 )(t2 + t3 \u2212 t1 )(t3 + t1 \u2212 t2 ).\n\n(34)\n\nOn the other hand, after a straightforward calculation, the determinant of the metric tensor\n(26) is given by\ng \u22121 = Det(g mn ) =\n\n(l1 l2 t3 + l2 l3 t1 + l3 l1 t2 )q\n.\n4t1 t2 t3 (t1 l1 + t2 l2 + t3 l3 )2\n\n(35)\n\nHence the action for the collective field (33) is\nKcol\n\n1\n=\n2\n\nZ\n\n2\n\ndtd z\n\n\u221a\n\ng\n\n\u0012\n\nt1 t2 t3\nl1 l2 t3 + l2 l3 t1 + l3 l1 t2\n\n\u0013 21 \u0012\n\nd\u03c6col\ndt\n\n\u00132\n\n.\n\n(36)\n\nWe do not have any explanations for the extra factor in (36). Anyway, in our present approximation without any interactions and a coordinate dependence of the lattice variables ti , li , we\nmay freely rescale the fields. Since the collective field \u03c6col has mass dimension \u22121, it is natural\n\nto rescale this field by a factor with a non-zero mass dimensions and define a new field with\nthe canonical dimension 1/2:\n\u03c6=\n\n\u0012\n\nt1 t2 t3\nl1 l2 t3 + l2 l3 t1 + l3 l1 t2\n9\n\n\u0013 14\n\n\u03c6col .\n\n(37)\n\n\fThe potential term can be determined from the condition that the energy-momentum relation\nbe generated correctly. Thus the effective action of the transverse modes should be\nStransverse = \u2212\n\nZ\n\n\u0013\n7 \u0012\nq\ni\ni\nX\n\u03bc\u03bd \u2202\u03c6 \u2202\u03c6\n,\nd x \u2212det(g\u03bc\u03bd )\ng\n\u03bc \u2202x\u03bd\n\u2202x\ni=1\n\n(38)\n\n\u0013\n\n(39)\n\n3\n\nwhere\ng\n\n\u03bc\u03bd\n\n=\n\n\u0012\n\n\u22121 0\n0 g mn\n\nand x\u03bc = (t, z i ).\nAs for the tangent modes, the collective field is given by a two-dimensional vector field.\nFollowing the same discussions given in our previous paper [8], the potential term of the low\nenergy Lagrangian has the gauge symmetry studied in the previous sections, and hence the\neffective theory is expected to be Maxwell theory. The action is\nZ\nq\n1\n3\nStangent = \u2212 d x \u2212det(g\u03bc\u03bd ) g \u03bc\u03bd g \u03c1\u03c3 F\u03bc\u03c1 F\u03bd\u03c3 .\n4\n\n(40)\n\nThe kinetic term of this action takes the form\n1\n\u2202am \u2202an\ngmn\n,\n2\n\u2202t \u2202t\n\n(41)\n\nwhere am (m = 1, 2) is the gauge potential, which represents the collective in-plane motion of\nthe string lattice in the target space-time. This kinetic term cannot be derived from a similar\nsimple argument as above for the scalar fields that an average mass m is assigned to each\njunction. This fact seems to indicate a subtlety of the in-plane string dynamics, and another\nmore careful treatment is necessary.\nSince the metric g \u03bc\u03bd is just constant in our periodic string lattice, from now on, we change\nthe coordinate and work in a coordinate with Minkowski metric g \u03bc\u03bd = diag(\u22121, 1, 1, 1) in\nthe following discussions about the fermionic sector and supersymmetries. The spectra of\nthe fermionic sector on a string lattice have also been discussed in [17]. There they showed\nthat the remaining world-sheet supersymmetries on strings are consistent with the boundary\nconditions at junctions, so that there is a one-to-one correspondence between the bosonic and\nfermionic spectra. Thus there exist one fermionic low energy propagation mode satisfying\n\u221a\n\u03c9 = \u00b1 g mn pm pn per each of the transverse directions and one in-plane fermionic mode. The\nsimplest fermion in (2+1)-dimensions is a Majorana fermion, which has two real component.\n\nThe Dirac equation for a Majorana fermion generates just what we want as the spectra for\n\n10\n\n\fthe low energy fermionic modes on a string lattice. Thus the action for the fermion should be\nZ\n8\nX\nSf ermion = d3 x\n\u03c8\u03b2T \u03930 \u0393\u03bc \u2202\u03bc \u03c8\u03b2 ,\n(42)\n\u03b2=1\n\nwhere we may take any two-by-two real representation of \u0393\u03bc .\nOn the other hand, Sen discussed the remaining supersymmetries by a supergravity argument [4]. The remaining supersymmetries are the solutions of\n\u01ebL = \u03930(10) \u03931(10) \u01ebL ,\n\u01ebR = \u2212\u03930(10) \u03931(10) \u01ebR ,\n\u01ebL = \u03930(10) \u03932(10) \u01ebR ,\n\n(43)\n\nwhere \u0393\u03bc(10) are the (9+1)-dimensional gamma matrices, and \u01ebL and \u01ebR are the MajoranaWeyl spinor 16 of SO(9, 1). Studying (43), there remain eight supersymmetries, and the\nsolutions to the first equation of (43) can be taken as the independent components. In our\ncase, the ten-dimensional space-time is divided into the (2+1)-dimensional lattice space-time\nand its transverse seven-dimensional space. Since 16 of SO(9, 1) is 2 \u00d7 8 of SO(2, 1) \u00d7 SO(7)\n\nand the first equation of (43) gives a condition just for the SO(2, 1) part2 , the remaining\n\nsupersymmetries are in the spinor representation 8 of SO(7). On the other hand the gauge\nfield and the scalar fields in the effective action is in the singlet and vector representation of\nSO(7), respectively. To combine the bosonic and fermionic fields into a multiplet the fermions\nin the effective action should be in the spinor representation. This pattern of the multiplet\nis just what we will obtain from the dimensional reduction of the (9+1)-dimensional N = 1\nvector multiplet to (2+1)-dimensions. Thus we conclude that the low energy effective theory\nis just given by the dimensional reduction of the N = 1 (9+1)-dimensional super Maxwell\ntheory.\nThis result sounds rather curious, since the number of the supersymmetries of the effective\naction should be eight rather than sixteen. In the low-energy effective action there is the twodimensional rotational symmetry, and so there are no good ways to impose non-rotationally\nsymmetric conditions as those in (43) on the sixteen supersymmetries of the effective action.\nOn the other hand at sufficiently high energy, the bare lattice structure will contribute to the\ndynamics. Thus it is expected that, although the supersymmetries are double in the effective\naction within our range of approximation of this paper, the higher order terms relevant at\nsufficiently high energy are expected to break a half of them.\n2\n\nThis SO(2, 1) symmetry should not be confused with the same symmetry of the effective action, because\nthe propagation velocity of the low energy modes is different from the light velocity of the target space.\n\n11\n\n\f5\n\nSummary and discussions\n\nIn this paper, we have discussed the low energy effective geometry on a two-dimensional string\nlattice, by studying the energy-momentum relations of the low energy propagation modes. An\ninteresting result is that the geometry is the same for the tangent and transverse oscillations,\nwhich makes it possible to assign one geometry to a given string lattice.\nWe have also discussed the effective action of the low energy propagation modes. We have\nobtained the dimensional reduction of N = 1 (9 + 1)-dimensional supersymmetric Maxwell\ntheory. A half of the sixteen supersymmetries are expected to be broken at high energy, where\nhigher order terms out of our range of approximation become relevant.\nWe should be careful about the fact that all the results in this paper are based on the\nassumption that the oscillations of a string lattice are small. This does not seem to be a\njustifiable assumption because the zero modes may considerably change the local structure of\nthe lattice and even its topology3 . As one can see from the explicit expression of the geometry\n(26), the changes of the string lengths change the low energy effective geometry on a string\nlattice, and so the zero mode dynamics might be related to the gravity side of the effective\nfield theory. This argument is yet very uncertain, and it seems an important open matter to\nidentify the roles of these zero modes in the low energy effective action.\n\nAcknowledgments\nThe author is supported in part by the Fellowship Program for Japanese Scholars and Researchers to study abroad, in part by Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (#12740150), and in\npart by Priority Area: \"Supersymmetry and Unified Theory of Elementary Particles\" (#707),\nfrom Ministry of Education, Science, Sports and Culture, Japan.\n\nReferences\n[1] J.
