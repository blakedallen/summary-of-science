One of\nthe major goals of the extragalactic astronomy is to understand what determines such properties of galaxies, and the\nfirst step toward the goal is to understand exactly how different the various galaxies are. One efficient way to comprehend the nature of the diverse galaxies is to classify\nthem using some criteria and to compare their statistical\nproperties between the classes. In many previous studies,\nhowever, galaxies have been classified using simple schemes\nbased on just one or two properties, which sometimes miss\n\n\u22c6\n\nE-mail: jhlee@astro.snu.ac.kr (JHL); mglee@astrog.snu.ac.kr\n(MGL); cbp@kias.re.kr (CBP); yychoi@kias.re.kr (YYC)\n\ndetailed aspects of galaxy evolution. For example, several\nunusual classes of galaxies such as blue early-type galaxies (Ferreras et al. 2005; Lee et al. 2006) and passive spiral galaxies (Yamauchi & Goto 2004; Ishigaki et al. 2007),\nor the fundamental parameter difference between finelydivided classes in the same morphology class (Lee et al.\n2007; Choi et al. 2009a) are difficult to investigate using simple classification schemes. Recently, Lee et al. (2008, 2009,\nhereafter Paper I and Paper II, respectively) presented studies on the optical and multi-wavelength properties of the\nSloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS; York et al. 2000) galaxies\ndivided into fine classes based on their morphology, colour\nand spectral features. Those finely-classified SDSS galaxies show distinguishable differences from each other in their\nphotometric (both optical and multi-wavelength) and structural properties, which are hardly found in the studies using\n\n\f2\n\nJ. H. Lee et al.\n\nsimple classification schemes. Based on the understanding of\nthe basic properties of the various galaxy classes presented\nin Paper I and Paper II, now it is needed to approach the\nnext question: what makes them have such diverse natures?\nFor a long time, the environments of galaxies have\nbeen regarded as important factors determining the nature of galaxies. Since close galaxies have influence on\neach other directly or indirectly, the local density about a\ngalaxy is closely related to the properties of that galaxy\n(Kuehn & Ryden 2005; Park et al. 2007). Environments in\nwhich galaxies have many chances to interact with each\nother, induce morphology transformation by the tidal interaction or merging of galaxies (Spitzer & Baade 1951;\nMerritt 1983; Coziol & Plauchu-Frayn 2007). Such galaxy\ninteractions convert the properties of galaxies, by triggering\nstar formation (Woods et al. 2006) or by suppressing star\nformation with tidal gas stripping (Marziani et al. 2003).\nMoreover, the complete merging of two or more galaxies\nis a classical candidate of the early-type galaxy formation\nmechanism (Toomre 1977; Searle & Zinn 1978). In addition\nto the direct interaction between galaxies, dense environments affect galaxies with their strong gravitational potential (Bekki 1999). Since large amount of hot gas is concentrated in high-density environments (e.g. galaxy clusters; Churazov et al. 1996), the morphology transformation of galaxies happens in such environments by the ram\npressure stripping (Gunn & Gott 1972; Quilis et al. 2000;\nRoediger & Hensler 2005).\nDue to the close relationships between environments\nand galaxy properties, many studies have been focused on\nthe environmental effects in galaxy evolution. Blanton et al.\n(2005) inspected the environmental dependence of optical\nproperties of the SDSS galaxies, finding that the colour is\nthe most sensitive parameter to the local density, and that\nthe other parameters are not sensitive to environments when\nthe colour and luminosity are fixed. Kuehn & Ryden (2005)\nfound that the surface brightness profile type and axis ratio of galaxies are frequently correlated with the local density. Bernardi et al. (2006) showed that the age, metallicity and \u03b1-element enhancement of galaxies are affected by\nthe environments of galaxies. Mateus et al. (2007) argued\nthat galaxy evolution is accelerated in dense environments,\nwhich took place mainly at high redshifts, based on the age \u2013\ndensity relations with respect to galaxy luminosity or mass.\nRogers et al. (2007) investigated the star formation history\nof early-type galaxies, showing that a significant number of\ngalaxies in high-density environments undergo low but detectable recent star formation. Owers et al. (2007) inspected\nthe environmental dependence of starburst galaxies, finding\nthat the starburst in a galaxy is triggered when its nearby\n(within 20 kpc) neighbour has similar luminosity or mass.\nWestoby et al. (2007) presented that most AGN host galaxies are closer to the red sequence than the blue sequence, but\nthey prefer lower density environments than red sequence\ngalaxies. Park et al. (2007) inspected the environmental dependence of physical properties of the SDSS galaxies, based\non the local density estimated using an adaptive smoothing kernel, showing that variations of galaxy properties are\nalmost entirely due to the environmental dependence of morphology and luminosity, and that other properties are almost\nindependent of local density, when morphology and luminosity are fixed. van den Bosch et al. (2008) found that the role\n\nof satellite galaxies in the transformation from blue sequence\ngalaxies to red sequence galaxies is important, in the sense\nthat the satellite galaxies may quench the star formation\nof their host galaxies. Park et al. (2008) and Park & Choi\n(2009) showed that the morphology of a galaxy depends\nsensitively on the distance and morphology of its nearest\nneighbour galaxy, and that galaxy properties in the general\nfield do not directly depend much on the large-scale background density. They showed that the apparent dependence\nof galaxy properties on the background density environment\ncan be largely explained by an accumulated result of the interactions between the nearest neighbour galaxies.\nSince it is obvious that environments affect galaxy properties significantly, environments must have played an important role in determining the fine classes (i.e. morphology, colour, and spectral features) of galaxies as well. Thus,\nto understand the origin of the various fine galaxy classes,\nit is needed to compare their environments. This is the\nthird in the series papers on the nature of galaxies in various classes based on the morphology, colour and spectral\nfeatures. In this paper, we investigate the environments of\nthe finely-divided galaxy classes, using several environmental parameters. The outline of this paper is as follows. Section 2 shows the data set we used, and \u00a73 describes our\nclassification scheme of the SDSS galaxies and the definition of the environmental parameters. In \u00a74, we present the\nresults, and their implication on galaxy evolution are discussed in \u00a75. The conclusions in this study are summarised\nin \u00a76. Throughout this paper, we adopt the cosmological\nparameters h = 0.7, \u03a9\u039b = 0.7, and \u03a9M = 0.3.\n\n2\n\nDATA AND SELECTION CRITERIA\n\nWe briefly summarise the datasets, classification scheme and\nsample selection in this paper. More details are described in\nPaper I and Paper II.\n2.1\n\nSloan Digital Sky Survey\n\nWe\nuse\nthe\nSDSS\nData\nRelease\n4\n(DR4;\nAdelman-McCarthy et al. 2006) main galaxy spectroscopic\nsample. The SDSS is a photometric and spectroscopic survey, mapping about one quarter of the whole sky, and the\nSDSS DR4 spectroscopic data cover 4783 deg2 . The median\nFWHM of point sources in the r band images is 1.4\u2032\u2032 , and the\nwavelength coverage in the spectroscopy is 3800 \u2013 9200\u00c5.\nWe use both the SDSS pipeline (Stoughton et al. 2002) data\nand the Max-Planck-Institute for Astronomy catalogue\n(MPA catalogue; Kauffmann et al. 2003a; Tremonti et al.\n2004; Gallazzi et al. 2006). Using the SDSS atlas images, we\nhave measured the colour gradient, inverse concentration\nindex, and the axis ratio of galaxies corrected for the inclination and the seeing effects (Choi et al. 2007). Corrections\nof the SDSS magnitudes have been conducted for the foreground extinction (Schlegel et al. 1998), the redshift effect\n(K-correction; Blanton et al. 2003) and galaxy luminosity\nevolution (evolutionary correction; Tegmark et al. 2004).\nWe corrected the observed magnitudes of about 360,000\nSDSS galaxies into the magnitudes at redshift z = 0.1,\nbecause the SDSS galaxies were observed most frequently\nthere. Since the corrections are optional in this paper,\n\n\fEnvironments of SDSS galaxy classes\n\nFigure 1.

The number of 2MASS extended sources\nmatched with our SDSS sample is about 200,000, with\nfalse match probability of 0.005 per cent. The InfraRed Astronomical Satellite (IRAS; Neugebauer et al. 1894) Faint\nSource Catalogue (FSC; Moshir et al. 1992) is used as a midand far-infrared dataset. About 7,000 IRAS sources were\nmatched with our SDSS sample, and the false match probability between SDSS and IRAS is about 0.071 per cent. We\nuse the Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty-centimetres\n(FIRST; Becker et al. 1995) data, and the number of the\nmatched FIRST sources is about 14,000, with 0.45 per cent\nfalse match probability. The Galaxy Evolution Explorer\n(GALEX; Marziani et al. 2003) survey GR2/GR3 data are\nused as an ultraviolet dataset. About 85,000 GALEX objects\nwere matched, with the false match probability about 1.46\nper cent. As an X-ray dataset, we use the Roentgen Satellite\n(ROSAT; Aschenbach et al. 1981) all sky survey data. The\ninformation of the ROSAT sources matched with the SDSS\nobjects provided by the SDSS is used, and the number of\nthe ROSAT sources is about 2,200.\n\nPassive\nHII\nSeyfert\nLINER\n\n2.3\n\npREG\nhREG\nsREG\nlREG\n\npBEG\nhBEG\nsBEG\nlBEG\n\nLate-type\nRed\nBlue\npRLG\nhRLG\nsRLG\nlRLG\n\npBLG\nhBLG\nsBLG\nlBLG\n\nClassifications and volume-limited sample\n\nIn this paper, we classify the SDSS galaxies using three criteria: morphology, colour and spectral features.

First, the SDSS galaxies were\nclassified into early-type galaxies and late-type galaxies in\nthe colour \u2013 colour gradient \u2013 light-concentration parameter space (Park & Choi 2005). Second, we divided the SDSS\ngalaxies into red galaxies and blue galaxies, based on the\ncolour distribution of early-type galaxies as a function of redshift (Lee et al. 2006).

Fig. 1 shows the distributions of different morphology and colour classes on the BPT diagram. As\nmentioned previously, it is noted that the three kinds of classification do not always agree with each other, showing the\nnecessity of fine classification. Those three galaxy classifications with different criteria return a total of 16 fine classes\nof galaxies: [early-type, late-type] \u00d7 [red, blue] \u00d7 [passive,\nHII, Seyfert, LINER]. Hereafter, we use the following abbreviations for the 16 galaxy classes: REG (red early-type\ngalaxy), BEG (blue early-type galaxy), RLG (red late-type\ngalaxy), BLG (blue late-type galaxy), and p- (passive), h(HII), s- (Seyfert), l- (LINER). The abbreviations for the 16\nfine galaxy classes are summarised in Table 1. For RLGs,\nwe only use RLGs with their axis ratio larger than 0.6, because many BLGs with large inclinations may be classified\ninto RLGs due to their internal dust extinction (Choi et al.\n2007).\nSince most properties of galaxies are known to be sensitive to their luminosity and redshift, the sample volume\nneeds to be carefully controlled in statistical studies of galaxies. Among the three volumes selected in Paper I and Paper\nII, we use the V1 sample as shown in Fig. 2, which contains\nthe largest number of galaxies and covers the brightest range\nof absolute magnitude among the three volumes: \u221222.92 6\n0.1KE\nMpet (r)1 6 \u221220.71 and 0.08 6 z 6 0.10. The number\nof galaxies in each fine class in this sample is listed in Table\n2, and more details about the sample-volume selection are\ndescribed in Paper I.\n\nneighbour as the kernel size, which means that the smoothing kernel size is adaptive to the local number density. The\nadaptive smoothing prevents oversmoothing in dense regions\nand preserves better the property of galaxy distributions\nthan a smoothing with a fixed kernel size, as described by\nPark et al. (2007), who used the spline-kernel with adaptive\nsize enclosing a fixed number of the nearest neighbour galaxies. In this paper, the local number density \u03c1N in Mpc\u22123 is\ndefined as:\n\u03c1N =\n\nn\nX\n\nfsp (dk /dn )/V\n\nwhere n is an integer to define the kernel size dn as the\ncomoving distance to the n-th nearest neighbour, and dk is\nthe comoving distance to the k-th nearest neighbour. fsp (x)\nis the spline kernel function and V is the local volume in\nMpc3 . It is noted that the dn and dk are projected comoving\ndistances in the 2D estimation. The local volume V is a\ncylinder in the 2D estimation, the height of which is 2000\nkm s\u22121 , while it is a sphere in the 3D estimation. From now\non, we denote the 2D- and 3D-based local number densities\nas 2D \u03c1N and 3D \u03c1N , respectively.\nThe local galaxy number density is the most frequently\nused local density indicator. However, the number density\ndoes not reflect the local environments perfectly, because\nthe properties of the counted galaxies are not considered\nin that parameter, such as their luminosity and colour. For\nthis reason, local luminosity density or local mass density are\nalso used as the local density indicators (Park et al. 2008;\nPark & Choi 2009). In this paper, we estimate local luminosity density in the r band (\u03c1r ), which is defined as:\n\u03c1r = \u22122.5 log\n\n\u0012X\nn\nk=1\n\n3\n3.1\n\nENVIRONMENTAL PARAMETERS\nLocal density indicators\n\nThere are two different ways in estimating the density of\nlocal environments, according to whether we define the local volume two-dimensionally (2D) or three-dimensionally\n(3D). In the 2D method, the projected local density is estimated within a fixed redshift interval centred on the target\ngalaxy. On the other hand, in the 3D method, the local\ndensity is estimated using the 3D distance calculated by regarding redshift difference purely as distance difference. It is\nknown that 2D-based parameters are more accurate in highdensity environments, while 3D-based parameters are more\naccurate in low-density environments (Cooper et al. 2005).\nSince both methods have their own merits and demerits,\nwe estimate both of them. In this paper, we adopt \u00b11000\nkm s\u22121 as the redshift interval for the 2D local density estimation. More detailed comparison between the 2D- and\n3D-based environmental parameters are shown in \u00a7A1.\nThe most frequently used parameter as a local density\nindicator is local number density (\u03c1N ). When estimating\n\u03c1N , we adopt a spline smoothing kernel (see \u00a7A2). In addition, we use the comoving distance to the n-th nearest\n\n1\n\nThe Petrosian absolute magnitude in the r band, after Kcorrection and evolutionary correction.\n\n(1)\n\nk=1\n\n\u22120.4 0.1K Mk (r)\n\nfsp (dk /dn )\u00d710\n\n\u0001\n\n/V\n\n\u0013\n\n(2)\n\nin the unit of absolute-mag Mpc\u22123 , where 0.1K Mk (r) is the\nK-corrected r band Petrosian absolute magnitude of the kth nearest neighbour. In the same manner, the local luminosity density in the u band (\u03c1u ) is defined, and the local\ncolour is simply defined as \u03c1u \u2212 \u03c1r . The behaviours of the\nlocal density indicators in this section are described in \u00a7A3\nwith more details. Throughout this paper, we adopt n = 5\nfor all local density indicators, to focus on the small-scale\nenvironments of galaxies (see \u00a7A3). We corrected the local luminosity densities by excluding the information of the\ntarget galaxy: target-excluded local luminosity density (\u03c1r \u2032 )\nand target-excluded local colour (\u03c1u \u2032 \u2212 \u03c1r \u2032 ). The necessity\nof this correction is described in \u00a7A4.\nSince our sample luminosity range is biased to the\nvery bright side of galaxy luminosity distribution, there is a\ncaveat that the estimated local luminosity density and local\ncolour may not exactly reflect the local environments. That\nis, the local luminosity density depends on the field-to-field\nvariation of galaxy luminosity function. Moreover, the local\ncolour may be bluer if we use a sample with more fainter\nluminosity range, because galaxy colours tend to be redder\nwith increasing luminosity (Choi et al. 2007). This should\nbe kept in mind throughout this paper.\nFig. 3 presents how \u03c1N and \u03c1r \u2032 are correlated with the\nclustercentric distance, based on the 2D and 3D estimation\nrespectively. The clustercentric distance is defined as the\nprojected comoving distance to the nearest known galaxy\n\n\fEnvironments of SDSS galaxy classes\n\n5\n\nFigure 3. (a) 2D \u03c1N versus the clustercentric distance. (b) 2D \u03c1r \u2032 versus the clustercentric distance. (c) 3D \u03c1N versus the clustercentric\ndistance. (d) 3D \u03c1r \u2032 versus the clustercentric distance. \u03c1\u0304N (= 2.469 \u00d7 10\u22123 Mpc\u22123 ) is the mean number density in our sample. The\nclustercentric distance is defined as the projected comoving distance to the nearest galaxy cluster within the \u00b11000 km s\u22121 redshift slice.\nIn each panel, the solid line connects the median local density values at given clustercentric distance bins.\n\nthe cluster regions is much smaller than the 2D \u03c1r \u2032 variation.\nIf we adopt 1 \u2013 2 Mpc as the typical radius of galaxy clusters, the intermediate environments between galaxy clusters\nand fields approximately correspond to about 2D \u03c1r \u2032 \u223c \u221217\n(2D \u03c1N /\u03c1\u0304N \u223c 20) and 3D \u03c1r \u2032 \u223c \u221217.5 (3D \u03c1N /\u03c1\u0304N \u223c 60), where\n\u03c1\u0304N (= 2.469 \u00d7 10\u22123 Mpc\u22123 ) is the mean number density in\nour sample. It is noted that the spectroscopic completeness\nin the central regions of rich clusters may be lower than\nthat in the field (Yoon et al. 2008). This effect causes the\nunderestimation of the local density in very-high-density environments, making the correlation between the local density and the clustercentric distance in Fig. 3 less clear. Fig. 4\nshows the \u03c1r \u2032 versus \u03c1u \u2032 \u2212\u03c1r \u2032 plot, an 'environmental colourmagnitude diagram'. Like the galaxy colour-magnitude diagram, the environmental colour-magnitude diagram shows\na sequence, in the sense that brighter \u03c1r \u2032 environments have\nredder \u03c1u \u2032 \u2212 \u03c1r \u2032 .\n3.2\n\nFigure 4.

Adopting the definition of Woods & Geller (2007), we estimate the pair fraction in each fine class. We define the brightest neighbour\nas the brightest one among the neighbour galaxies satisfying the close pair definition for a given target galaxy. The\nr-band absolute magnitude and u \u2212 r colour of the brightest neighbour are denoted as 0.1K M (r)BrightestNeighbour and\n0.1K\n(u \u2212 r)BrightestNeighbour respectively, the distribution of\nwhich will be compared between the fine classes, in the next\nsection. It is noted that the close pairs in this paper do not\nnecessarily mean that they are currently interacting pairs,\nwhich should be more strictly defined using the virial radii\nof the pair galaxies (Park et al. 2008; Park & Choi 2009;\n\n\f6\n\nJ. H. Lee et al.\n\nFigure 5. (a) The dependence of the early-type class fractions on the 2D local number density. (b) The same as (a), but for the late-type\nclasses. (c) The dependence of the early-type class fractions on the target-excluded 2D local luminosity density. (d) The same as (c), but\nfor the late-type classes. Errorbars show the Poisson errors. The intermediate range between cluster and field environments is denoted\nas the shaded domain.\n\nPark & Hwang 2009). However, due to the practical difficulty in estimating the mass-to-light ratio of each fine class,\nwe use this simple definition of close pairs, which selects pair\ngalaxies that have relatively high chance of recent interactions.\n\n4\n4.1\n\nRESULTS\nLocal density\n\nFig. 5 and 6 show the dependence of each class fraction\non the local number density and the (target-excluded) local luminosity density. The class fraction in Fig. 5 and 6\nis defined as the number fraction of the galaxies in a fine\n\nclass among the entire galaxies, at given local density bin.\nThe REG fraction at high-density environments is much\nlarger than that at low-density environments. However, as\nreported by Westoby et al. (2007), it is found that AGN\nREGs (sREGs and lREGs) prefer slightly lower density environments than non-AGN REGs (pREGs and hREGs). In\nFig. 5a, non-AGN REG fractions monotonically increase as\nthe local density increases, while AGN REG fractions have\na peak at 2D \u03c1N /\u03c1\u0304N \u223c 60 (2D \u03c1r \u2032 \u223c \u221218). At denser environments than the peak density, the number fraction of AGN\nREGs does not increase any more or even decreases with\nlarge uncertainty as the local density increases. It is noted\nthat the peak local density is very close to the intermediate\nlocal density between cluster and field environments (see\n\n\fEnvironments of SDSS galaxy classes\n\n7\n\nFigure 6. The same as Fig. 5, but for the 3D local density indicators.\n\nFig. 3). This feature is hardly found in Fig. 6, but the 3D\nestimation is less reliable than the 2D estimation at highdensity environments. Note that the Y-axis scales in Fig. 5\nand Fig. 6 are very different between the panels (i.e. between\nthe fine classes). A better view of the fine class composition\nat fixed local density is presented in Fig. 7, which compares\nthe class fraction between the fine classes at given 2D local\nluminosity density bin.\nNon-AGN RLGs (pRLGs and hRLGs) show a trend\nsimilar to non-AGN REGs, in the sense that their number\nfraction increases as the local density increases. The fraction of AGN RLGs (sRLGs and lRLGs) shows a peak at\nintermediate-density environments and the number fraction\nof AGN RLGs decreases as the local density increases at\nhigh-density environments (2D \u03c1N /\u03c1\u0304N > 20 or 2D \u03c1r \u2032 < \u221217).\nIn the 3D local density, this feature is also found in the\nlRLGs but not found in the sRLGs (Fig. 6). Fig. 8 com-\n\npares the number fraction of red non-AGN galaxies (pREG\n+ hREG + pRLG + hRLG), red AGN-host galaxies (sREG\n+ lREG + sRLG + lRLG), blue non-AGN galaxies (pBEG\n+ hBEG + pBLG + hBLG), and blue AGN-host galaxies (sBEG + lBEG + sBLG + lBLG). In this figure, it is\nclearly shown that the number fraction of AGN-host galaxies rapidly decreases as the local density increases at highdensity environments (which approximately correspond to\ngalaxy cluster environments), with significant difference between red non-AGN galaxies and red AGN-host galaxies.\nIn Fig. 5 and 6, no significantly different trend is found\nbetween pREGs and hREGs, which implies that the local\ndensity is not directly responsible for the star formation in\nhREGs. The fraction of AGN BEGs (sBEGs and lBEGs) increases as the local density decreases, whereas the non-AGN\nBEG fraction seem to have a peak at intermediate-density\nenvironments with large uncertainty. The BLG fraction at\n\n\f8\n\nJ. H. Lee et al.\n\nFigure 7. Comparison of the class fraction between the fine classes at given 2D local luminosity density bin. In each panel, the X-axis\nbins indicate the fine classes in order of: pREG, hREG, sREG, lREG, pBEG, hBEG, sBEG, lBEG, pRLG, hRLG, sRLG, lRLG, pBLG,\nhBLG, sBLG and lBLG. The errorbars show the Poisson errors.\n\nlow-density environments is much larger than that at highdensity environments. The pBLG fraction as a function of\nlocal density is less biased to low local density than the other\nBLGs, but the uncertainty is large.\n\n4.2\n\nMedian local luminosity density and the local\ncolour\n\nFig. 9 plots the median \u03c1r \u2032 and \u03c1u \u2032 \u2212\u03c1r \u2032 of the 16 fine galaxy\nclasses with their sampling errors. The sampling errors were\nestimated from 200-times random sampling tests for given\nsample size, which show how statistically significant the differences in the median \u03c1r \u2032 and \u03c1u \u2032 \u2212 \u03c1r \u2032 are between dif-\n\nferent fine classes. The median \u03c1r \u2032 and \u03c1u \u2032 \u2212 \u03c1r \u2032 values,\ntheir sample inter-quartile ranges (SIQRs) and sampling errors are summarised in Table 3 and 4. In Fig. 9, even the\nfine classes in the same morphology-colour class have often\nsignificantly different environments. For example, pREGs\nand hREGs have similar environments (2D \u03c1r \u2032 \u223c \u221216.2 and\n2D\n(\u03c1u \u2032 \u2212 \u03c1r \u2032 ) \u223c 2.45), but AGN REGs (sREGs and lREGs)\nhave significantly different environments from those of nonAGN REGs by more than 5\u03c3, in the sense that AGN REGs\nprefer less dense and bluer environments (2D \u03c1r \u2032 \u223c \u221215.7 and\n2D\n(\u03c1u \u2032 \u2212 \u03c1r \u2032 ) \u223c 2.39) than pREGs and hREGs.

However, they show distinguishable\ndifference in the 3D estimation, in the sense that lBLGs\nprefer slightly higher local density and redder local colour\nthan sBLGs (by 2.5\u03c3). As mentioned in \u00a73.1, the 2D parameters show good performance at high-density environments,\nwhile the 3D parameters work well at low-density environments. Thus, it seems that the environments of RLGs are\nmore reliable in the 2D estimation, whereas those of BLGs\nare more reliable in the 3D estimation.\npRLGs have environments similar to those of pREGs,\nbut pBLGs prefer environments significantly (3.3\u03c3) less\ndense than those of pREGs. The environments of pBEGs\nare intermediate between those of passive red galaxies and\npBLGs, but their sampling errors are very large (< 1\u03c3).\nAs mentioned in the previous section, hREGs prefer highdensity environments in spite of their current star formation.\nhRLGs have the local density similar to those of hREGs,\nand the environments of hBEGs are less dense than those of\nhRLGs by 2.4\u03c3. It is noted that hREGs, hBEGs and hRLGs\nhave different median \u03c1r \u2032 but similar median \u03c1u \u2032 \u2212 \u03c1r \u2032 .\nHowever, hBLGs prefer significantly (> 2.7\u03c3) bluer environments than the other HII classes. No large difference is\nfound between Seyfert galaxies and LINER galaxies. Among\nAGN host galaxies, AGN REGs prefer the highest-density\nenvironments, and AGN RLGs have environments slightly\n(1.8\u03c3) less dense than AGN REGs. AGN BEGs and AGN\nBLGs prefer similarly low-density environments.\n\n\u00b1values show the sampling errors, and (value)s show the SIQRs.\n\n4.3\nFor late-type galaxies, the 2D and 3D environmental parameters show somewhat different trends from each other.\nFor example, pRLGs prefer significantly higher local density\n(by 5.5\u03c3) and redder local colour (by 4.1\u03c3) than AGN RLGs\nin the 2D estimation, while the significance of such difference is relatively small in the 3D estimation (2\u03c3 and 3.1\u03c3,\nrespectively). The local density and the local colour of BLGs\nare almost the same between their different spectral classes\n\nClose pair\n\nFig. 10 shows the relationship between the pair fraction and\nthe local number density of the fine classes. As expected, it\nis found that the fine class with higher median local number\ndensity tends to have larger pair fraction in Fig. 10. For example, the pair fraction of hREGs (2D \u03c1N /\u03c1\u0304N \u223c 0.9) is about\n2 per cent, while that of hBLGs (2D \u03c1N /\u03c1\u0304N \u223c 0.55) is about\n0.55 per cent. In addition to this overall trend, some fine\nclasses seem to show distinguishable difference in their pair\n\n\f10\n\nJ. H. Lee et al.\n\nFigure 9.

For example,\nthe pair fraction of hBLGs is half of that of AGN BLGs\ndespite their similar local number density, which shows the\npossibility that the pair interaction is responsible for the\nAGN activity in BLGs. Some other class sets seem to show\npair fraction difference with similar local number density,\nsuch as 'sRLGs \u2013 lRLGs \u2013 hRLGs', 'lREGs \u2013 sREGs' and\n'hREGs \u2013 'pREGs', but their uncertainty is large.\nFig. 11 presents what properties the brightest neigh-\n\nbours in each fine class have: absolute magnitude, colour and\nlocal number density. It is found that the brightest neighbours of red galaxies have a narrow range of their colour,\nwhile those of blue galaxies show scattered colour distributions. This difference does not seem to correlate with the absolute magnitude or the local number density. Fig. 12 shows\nthe 0.1K (u \u2212 r) colour distribution of the brightest neighbours in each fine class.

On the other hand, hBLGs and sBLGs show quite\ndifferent 0.1K (u \u2212 r)BrightestNeighbour distributions from those\nof the red galaxies: the 0.1K (u \u2212 r)BrightestNeighbour distributions of hBLGs and sBLGs show double peak features, with\nthe primary blue peak at 0.1K (u \u2212 r)BrightestNeighbour = 1.6\nand the secondary red peak at 0.1K (u \u2212 r)BrightestNeighbour =\n2.8. The secondary red peak colour of the hBLG and sBLG\nbrightest neighbours is similar to the single peak colour of\nthe red galaxy brightest neighbours. It is noted that the blue\npeak of sBLGs is twice in size of their red peak, whereas\nlBLGs show a single red peak. Table 5 lists the pair fraction\n\nand median 0.1K (u \u2212 r) colour of the brightest neighbours in\neach class.\n\n4.4\n\nMulti-wavelength detection and environments\n\nIn Paper II, we presented several multi-wavelength properties of the SDSS galaxies divided into fine classes. In the\nmulti-wavelength study, the detection trends of the fine\nclasses vary largely according to the survey wavelength.\nFor example, the most/least efficiently detected classes are\nlRLGs/pBEGs in the 2MASS, while those in the FIRST\nare sBLGs/pRLGs. Such variation is mainly due to the differences in the internal properties between the fine classes,\n\n\f12\n\nJ. H. Lee et al.\n\nFigure 13.

The line shows the ROSAT detection fraction of the optically passive galaxies. The\nintermediate \u03c1N and \u03c1r \u2032 ranges between cluster and field environments are denoted as the shaded domains. The errorbars show the\nPoisson errors.\n\nbut some galaxies show multi-wavelength properties that\nare not easy to understand just by their intrinsic characteristics, such as optically passive but X-ray bright galaxies.\nThose unusual properties are sometimes related to their external conditions, because some environments (e.g. galaxy\nclusters) themselves have strong emission in some wavelength such as X-ray (Bourdin et al. 2004). Thus, in this section, we briefly investigate the environmental dependence of\nmulti-wavelength detection fractions for our sample galaxies, which helps us to understand the multi-wavelength behaviours of the fine classes better.\nFig. 13 shows the dependence of the detection fractions in the multi-wavelength surveys on the local luminosity\n\ndensity. The 2MASS detection fraction increases as the local density increases, whereas the detection fractions in the\nIRAS and GALEX decrease with increasing local density.\nConsidering the detection trends of the fine galaxy classes\nin the multi-wavelength bands (Paper II), Fig. 13 confirms\nthe previous finding that galaxies in high-density environments tend to have red colours, old ages and early-type\nmorphology, compared to those in low-density environments\n(Blanton et al. 2005; Bernardi et al. 2006; Park et al. 2007).\nThe FIRST detection fraction shows quite different trends\nbetween the 2D and 3D local density parameters. The 2D local density of the FIRST detection fraction increases almost\nmonotonically as the local density increases, while its 3D\n\n\fEnvironments of SDSS galaxy classes\nTable 5.

In Fig. 13a, the largest\n(at 2D \u03c1N /\u03c1\u0304N \u223c 1700) and the smallest (at 2D \u03c1N /\u03c1\u0304N \u223c 5)\nROSAT detection fractions are different by 2.3 dex. This result indicates that the bias of the ROSAT-detected galaxies\nto red colour (Paper II) is closely related to the environments\nof galaxies, because red galaxies prefer high-density environments as shown in Fig. 5. In Fig. 13, the ROSAT detection\nfraction of the passive galaxies (solid line) is very similar\nto that of the entire galaxies (open circles), showing that\nthe passive galaxies in high-density environments have high\nprobability to be detected in the X-ray. Since galaxy clusters\nare typically strong X-ray emitters with a large amount of\nintracluster hot gas (McMillan et al. 1989; Rhee & Latour\n1991; Bourdin et al. 2004), some ROSAT-detected passive\ngalaxies in high-density environments may be affected by\nsuch cluster environments. However, some passive galaxies\nin low-density environments are also detected in the X-ray.\nThe number fraction of the ROSAT-detected passive galaxies at 3D \u03c1r \u2032 > \u221217 among the entire ROSAT-detected passive galaxies is about 30 per cent (16 of 54), which are classified as X-ray Bright Optically Normal Galaxies (XBONGs;\nYuan & Narayan 2004; Civano et al. 2007).\n\n5\n5.1\n\n13\n\n1980; Postman & Geller 1984). Recently, Park et al. (2007)\nshowed that the number fraction of early-type galaxies\nmonotonically increases as the local density increases at\ngiven luminosity. In this paper, pREGs and hREGs show\ngood agreement with those previous results, displaying\nstrong and monotonic dependence of their number fraction on their local density. However, unlike those non-AGN\nREGs, the number fraction of AGN REGs (sREGs and\nlREGs) is not a monotonic function of the local density.\nInstead, they have a peak at 2D \u03c1N /\u03c1\u0304N \u223c 60 (2D \u03c1r \u2032 \u223c \u221218),\nwhich is very close to the intermediate local density between cluster and field environments shown in Fig. 3. This\ndifference between non-AGN and AGN REGs results in\nthe difference in their median local luminosity density and\nlocal colour (Fig. 9): AGN REGs prefer less dense and\nbluer environments than pREGs and hREGs by more than\n5\u03c3 significance. This result is closely related to the fact\nthat AGN host galaxies prefer the green valley domain in\nthe colour-magnitude diagram, which is intermediate between the red and blue sequences (Silverman et al. 2008;\nChoi et al. 2009b; Hickox et al. 2009), because galaxy colour\nand local density are tightly correlated (Park et al. 2007).\nIf we suppose that galaxies at very-high-density environments are mostly cluster galaxies (supported by Fig. 3),\ncluster environments seem to suppress AGN activity, reducing the number fraction of AGN REGs at very-high-density\nenvironments. Park & Hwang (2009) discussed several possible mechanisms causing a sudden variation of the galaxy\nmorphology in cluster environments, such as galaxy-galaxy\ntidal interaction, galaxy-cluster potential interaction and\ngalaxy-galaxy hydrodynamic interaction. Those mechanisms\nprobably affect also the AGN activity in cluster environments: the mechanisms such as galaxy-galaxy interactions\nor harassment may deprive cluster galaxies of cold gas that\ncan be the fuel of AGNs, resulting in a sudden decrease of\nAGN host galaxies in very-high-density environments.\nDuring the study of the early-type star formation history, Rogers et al. (2007) found that a significant number of\ngalaxies in high-density environments undergo low but detectable recent star formation. hREGs in our sample may\ncorrespond to those objects, which show no significant difference in the local density distribution from pREGs. Such\nsimilarity of environments between pREGs and hREGs implies that the local density is not directly responsible for\nthe star formation in hREGs. Since satellite or close pair\ngalaxies play an important role in determining the properties\nof the target galaxy (van den Bosch et al. 2008; Park et al.\n2008; Park & Choi 2009), it is a possible scenario that the\nstar formation in hREGs is triggered by the interaction with\ntheir close neighbour galaxies. In Fig. 10, it is found that\nhREGs tend to have higher chance of pairs (1.98 \u00b1 0.29 per\ncent) than pREGs (1.51 \u00b1 0.17 per cent). However, this difference is statistically not meaningful (1.4\u03c3 significance) in\nour sample. It is an open question why the AGN-suppressing\nmechanisms (discussed in the previous paragraph) seem not\nto suppress the star formation in hREGs.\n\nDISCUSSION\nRed Early-type Galaxies\n\nThe environments of REGs are previously well studied,\nin the sense that galaxies at high-density environments\ntend to have early-type morphology (Oemler 1974; Dressler\n\n5.2\n\nBlue Early-type Galaxies\n\nSince the number fraction of BEGs out of the entire galaxies\nis very small (about 1.3 per cent in our sample), there are\nnot many previous statistical studies on their environments.\n\n\f14\n\nJ. H. Lee et al.\n\nIn Park et al. (2007), it has been shown that the number\nfraction of BEGs out of early-type galaxies decreases as\nthe local density increases. More recently, Kannappan et al.\n(2009) found that many blue-sequence E/S0 galaxies reside\nin low-to-intermediate-density environments. Similar results\nare shown in this paper that the BEG fraction at low-density\nenvironments is higher than that at high-density environments. However, there seems to be a difference between nonAGN BEGs and AGN BEGs, in the sense that AGN BEG\n(sBEG and lBEG) fraction increases monotonically as the\nlocal density decreases, whereas the non-AGN BEG fraction\nhas a intermediate-density peak (Fig. 5 and 6). This is similar to the relationship between non-AGN REGs and AGN\nREGs. However, due to the very small sample size of BEGs,\nthe uncertainty is so large that the statistical reliability of\nthe results for BEGs is not high (less than 2.3\u03c3 significance\nfrom Fig. 9).\nIn Paper I and Paper II, BEGs show the photometric and structural properties implying that they are earlytype galaxies in the forming phase. Since it is known\nthat high-density environments accelerate galaxy evolution\n(Mateus et al. 2007), the preference for low-density environments of BEGs seem to be natural, explaining why those\nearly-type galaxies (BEGs) are forming so lately compared\nto REGs. In detail, however, the environmental discrepancy\nbetween non-AGN BEGs and AGN BEGs is not easy to\nexplain, because AGN-host galaxies are thought to be in\nthe intermediate phase from star-forming galaxies to passive\ngalaxies (AGN feedback; Antonuccio-Delogu & Silk 2008;\nRafferty et al. 2008).\n5.3\n\nRed Late-type Galaxies\n\nRLGs are mostly regarded as bulge-dominated late-type\ngalaxies (Paper I and II). RLGs are not frequently mentioned in the previous studies, but several studies provided some hints on their environments. That is, it\nis known that galaxies have greater bulge-to-disc ratio\n(or high light-concentration) with increasing local density\n(Giuricin et al. 1995; Hashimoto & Oemler 1999). As probable bulge-dominated galaxies, RLGs agree with those previous findings. Non-AGN RLGs (pRLGs and hRLGs) show\na trend similar to non-AGN REGs, in the sense that their\nnumber fraction increases as the local density increases. On\nthe other hand, the AGN RLG (sRLG and lRLG) fraction\nshows a peak at intermediate-density environments, which\nis a trend similar to that of AGN REGs. In the same context as AGN REGs (\u00a75.1), it seems that the AGN activity\nin RLGs are suppressed at very-high-density environments.\nThe unanswered problem in \u00a75.1 (why very-high-density\nenvironments do not suppress the star formation?) is less\nserious in RLGs, because the number fraction of hRLGs\nslightly decreases at the highest-density environment with\nlarge uncertainty (Fig. 5; 1.2\u03c3 significance). However, this\ndecrease is statistically not meaningful and the star formation in hRLGs seems to be clearly less suppressed than the\nAGN activity in AGN RLGs at high-density environments.\nTo understand this problem better, further studies on the\nHII galaxies and AGN host galaxies in cluster environments\nare needed in the future.\nIn Paper I and II, pRLGs have properties very similar to\nthose of REGs. Interestingly, in this paper, pRLGs have en-\n\nvironments similar to those of pREGs. This result supports\nthe idea that pRLGs are intermediate objects between earlytype galaxies and late-type galaxies as suggested in Paper I\nand II.\n5.4\n\nBlue Late-type Galaxies\n\nBLGs mostly consist of spiral or irregular galaxies, which\nhave the opposite trend to REGs in their environments.\nThat is, galaxies with late-type morphology tend to be\nat low-density environments (Oemler 1974; Dressler 1980;\nPostman & Geller 1984; Park et al. 2007). In this paper,\nconsistent with those previous findings, the number fraction\nof BLGs increases almost monotonically as the local density\ndecreases. Exceptionally, pBLGs seem to prefer intermediate\ndensity environments, but the sample size is too small.\nIn Fig. 10, hREGs have a similar pair fraction to\npREGs. On the contrary, hBLGs have a smaller pair fraction\nthan the other BLGs (significant up to 2.4\u03c3) despite their\nsimilar local number density. This result indicates that the\nclose pair interaction is less important for the star formation\nof BLGs compared to that of REGs, at least in our sample\nluminosity range (\u221222.92 <0.1KE Mpet (r) < \u221220.71). On\nthe other hand, the close pair interaction may be responsible for the AGN activity in BLGs.\nIn Fig. 12, the different spectral classes of BLGs show\nimpressive differences in their close pair colour distribution.\nhBLGs have both a blue peak (\u223c 1.6) and a red peak\n(\u223c 2.8) in their 0.1K (u \u2212 r)BrightestNeighbour distribution, and\nthe two peaks have similar size. sBLGs also show the double peak feature, but the red peak is just half in size compared to the blue peak. On the other hand, lBLGs have\nonly a red peak, which is similar to that of red galaxies.\nThe difference in the brightest neighbour colour between\nsBLGs and lBLGs also affect the median local colours of\nthem, in the sense that sBLGs prefer slightly bluer local\ncolour than lBLGs (Fig. 9b). It is noted that the single red\n0.1K\n(u\u2212r)BrightestNeighbour peak of lBLGs is unusual, considering the conformity of pair galaxies (Weinmann et al. 2006;\nPark et al. 2008). These results show a possibility that the\nsupply of fuel gas from outer sources is closely related to\nthe AGN type: Seyfert or LINER. In other words, at least\nfor BLGs, it seems like that Seyfert galaxies tend to have\nblue close pairs that may supply rich fuel gas for the target\ngalaxy, unlike LINER galaxies.\nHowever, this conclusion is very cautious for two reasons. First, the uncertainty in the 0.1K (u\u2212r)BrightestNeighbour\ndistribution of BLGs is large, because the number of BLGs\nhosting close pair galaxies is not large enough. Second, such\na trend (the difference in the 0.1K (u \u2212 r)BrightestNeighbour distribution between Seyferts and LINERs) is not found in the\nother morphology-colour classes. This may be due to the\nlimited range of the sample galaxy luminosity, but it is not\nassured in this paper. Nevertheless, it is not easy to neglect\nthe difference between sBLGs and lBLGs shown in Fig. 11\nand 12, either. This problem needs more inspection in the\nfuture, using a larger sample of close pairs.\n5.5\n\nComparison in a given spectral class\n\npRLGs have environments similar to those of pREGs, but\npBLGs prefer environments significantly less dense and bluer\n\n\fEnvironments of SDSS galaxy classes\nthan those of pREGs (3.3\u03c3 significance). The local environments of pBEGs are intermediate between those of passive\nred galaxies and pBLGs, but their sampling errors are large\n(less than 1\u03c3 significance). The preference for low-density\nenvironments of pBLGs is not surprising, because many of\nthem may not be genuinely passive (Paper II). Except for\npBLGs, the other passive galaxies prefer relatively dense\nand red environments as expected. All ROSAT-detected\noptically-passive galaxies are passive red galaxies (Paper II)\nand about 70 per cent of them reside in high-density environments like galaxy clusters. Since a galaxy cluster itself\nis a strong source of X-ray, some of those galaxies may be\ncontaminated by the galaxy cluster X-ray emission.\nIn spite of their current star formation, hREGs prefer high-density environments. It is interesting that hREGs,\nhBEGs and hRLGs have different \u03c1r \u2032 distributions but similar \u03c1u \u2032 \u2212 \u03c1r \u2032 distributions. On the other hand, hBLGs prefer significantly (more than 2.7\u03c3 significance) bluer environments than the other HII classes. Since the luminosity of\nour sample galaxies is limited to the bright end, this does\nnot necessarily mean that HII galaxies except hBLGs do not\nhave blue neighbours. If hREGs, hBEGs and hRLGs have\nsome blue neighbours, the neighbours may be fainter than\nthe lower luminosity limit (0.1KE Mpet (r) = \u221220.71) of our\nsample. The pair fraction of hREGs is similar to that of\npREGs, while the pair fraction of hBLGs is smaller than\nthat of non-HII BLGs (significant up to 2.4\u03c3). This indicates that the role of close pairs is less important for hBLGs\nthan for hREGs.\n\n6\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nHere, we summarise the new findings in this paper and their\nimplication on galaxy evolution.\n(1) The morphology-colour class of galaxies strongly depends on the local density. The approximate order of highdensity preference is REGs \u2013 RLGs \u2013 BEGs \u2013 BLGs.\n(2) In low-density environments, the fraction of AGN host\ngalaxies increases as the local density increases, but it decreases in high-density environments that approximately\ncorrespond to cluster environments. This indicates that\nhigh-density environments (like cluster environments) suppress AGN activity.\n(3) The local luminosity density distribution of hREGs is\nalmost the same as that of pREGs. It is an open question\nwhy the AGN-suppressing mechanisms at high-density environments do not suppress the star formation in hREGs.\n(4) The non-AGN BEGs prefer intermediate-density environments, while the AGN BEGs prefer low-density environments like BLGs, although with low significance. In the context of early-type formation, such preference for low-density\nenvironments of BEGs seems to reflect the later formation\nof early-type galaxies at lower-density environments.\n(5) pRLGs that have properties very similar to those of\nREGs (Paper I and II) have environments similar to those\nof pREGs, which confirms the idea that pRLGs are intermediate objects between early-type galaxies and late-type\ngalaxies as suggested in Paper I and II.\n\n15\n\n(6) The pair fraction of hREGs does not show statistically\nsignificant difference from that of pREGs (1.4\u03c3 significance),\nwhile the pair fraction of hBLGs is smaller than that of nonHII BLGs (significant up to 2.4\u03c3), indicating that the close\npair interaction is less important for the star formation of\nBLGs compared to that of REGs.\n(7) Red galaxies show a single red peak in the distribution of the brightest neighbour colour, whereas hBLGs and\nsBLGs show double (red + blue) peaks. The brightest neighbours of sBLGs tend to be blue, while those of lBLGs tend\nto be red, which shows the possible relationship between\nAGN types and close pair interactions.\n(8) Some ROSAT-detected passive galaxies in high-density\nenvironments may be affected by galaxy cluster environments. However, about 28 per cent (15 of 54) of the ROSATdetected passive galaxies reside in low-density environments,\nwhich are classified as X-ray Bright Optically Normal Galaxies (XBONGs).\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nJHL appreciates the support and advice of Dr. Eon-Chang\nSung.

Practically, however, the distance estimation for distant\ngalaxies has very large uncertainty compared to the determination of the 2D coordinates on the plane perpendicular to\nthe line-of-sight, due to the intrinsic limit of the distance estimation. The distances to galaxies are typically measured\nby means of determining the recession velocities of galaxies caused by the cosmological expansion. However, it has a\n\n\fEnvironments of SDSS galaxy classes\n\nFigure A1. The difference between the 2D and 3D local density\nestimates as a function of the 2D local density: (a) local number\ndensity and (b) local luminosity density. The different line type\nindicates the different redshift interval in estimating the 2D local\ndensity: \u2206v = \u00b1500 km s\u22121 (long-dashed line), \u00b11000 km s\u22121\n(solid line) and \u00b12000 km s\u22121 (short-dashed line).\n\nproblem that the recession velocity of a galaxy is given by\nboth the cosmological expansion and the peculiar motion of\nthat galaxy.\nThe velocity dispersions of typical rich galaxy clusters\nrange from 500 km s\u22121 to 2000 km s\u22121 (Teague et al. 1990).\nSuppose that a galaxy cluster at z = 0.1 has velocity dispersion of 1000 km s\u22121 . In that cluster, 32 per cent of its\nmember galaxies have relative velocities larger than 1000\nkm s\u22121 , compared to the dynamical centre of the cluster,\nwhich results in redshift difference larger than 0.003. If we\nestimate the distance to the member galaxies with ignoring\nthe peculiar velocity effect, the 0.003 redshift difference is\ninterpreted as the distance difference of 13 Mpc. Since the\ntypical diameter scale of galaxy clusters is at most a few\nMpc, this causes significant underestimation of the 3D local\nnumber density in rich galaxy clusters. On the other hand,\nsince such a peculiar velocity effect is very small in the low\ndensity fields, the 3D local density is more accurate than the\n2D local density in low-density environments.\nFig. A1 compares between the 2D and 3D local density\nindicators, showing a clear trend that the 3D local density\nis smaller than the 2D local density at high-density environments, while the 3D local density is larger than the 2D local\ndensity at low-density environments. The difference between\nthe 2D and 3D densities tends to increase as the redshift interval in estimating the 2D local density increases.\n\nA2\n\nSmoothing Kernel\n\nWe adopted a spline smoothing kernel when estimating the\nlocal density, because it is centrally weighted unlike the uniform kernel and because it has a finite size unlike the Gaus-\n\n17\n\nFigure A2. Smoothing kernels for local density estimation as a\nfunction of d/dn : uniform (short-dashed) and spline (solid). d is\nthe distance from the target object, and dn is the kernel size.\n\nsian kernel. The basic functional form of the spline kernel is\ndescribed well in Cabez\u00f3n et al. (2008). In this paper, the\nspline kernel is defined as:\nfsp (d/dn ) = A\n\n(\n\n1 \u2212 6(d/dn )2 + 6(d/dn )3\n2(1 \u2212 d/dn )3\n0\n\n0 6 d/dn 6 0.5\n0.5 < d/dn 6 1 (A1)\nd/dn > 1\n\nwhere d is the distance from the target object and dn is the\nkernel size. A is a constant, which has the value of 40/7 and\n32/3 in the 2D and 3D local density estimation, respectively.\nFig. A2 shows the shape of the spline kernel used in this\npaper.\nA3\n\nLocal Density Indicators\n\nAs a local density indicator, the local galaxy number density is quite useful but has some weakness at the same time.\nThat is, in the local number density estimation, both five\nfaint blue galaxies and five bright red galaxies are commonly\ncounted as five galaxies, which is missing the luminosity and\ncolour information of the counted galaxies. The luminosity\ndispersion problem can be minimised by limiting the luminosity of the counted galaxies to a narrow range (Park et al.\n2007). However, another way to reflect both the luminosity\nand colour information of the galaxies in the local environments is to estimate the local luminosity density and the\nlocal colour. It should be reminded that the local luminosity\ndensity is not the same as the local mass density (Park et al.\n2008; Park & Choi 2009), because galaxies with the same\nmass may have quite different luminosity according to their\nmass-to-light ratio. Thus, both the local number density and\nthe local luminosity density need to be compared for more\nreliable environmental analysis.\nFig. A3a shows the distribution of the local galaxy number density (\u03c1N ) divided by the mean number density in our\n\n\f18\n\nJ. H. Lee et al.\n\nFigure A3. (a) The distribution of the 2D local number density (2D \u03c1N ) divided by the mean number density (\u03c1\u0304N ) for the SDSS\ngalaxies in the volume-limited sample.

(c) Local colour (2D (\u03c1u \u2212 \u03c1r )) distribution. (d) The\nlocal number density \u2013 local luminosity density relation, using d5 . The line shows the least-squares fit using the ordinary least-squares\nbisector method (Isobe et al. 1990).\n\nsample, \u03c1\u0304N = 2.469 \u00d7 10\u22123 Mpc\u22123 . Fig. A3b and Fig. A3c\nare the same as Fig. A3a, but for the local luminosity density\n(\u03c1r ) and the local colour (\u03c1u \u2212 \u03c1r ), respectively. When the\nlarger n value of the kernel size dn is adopted, the distributions of \u03c1N /\u03c1\u0304N , \u03c1r and \u03c1u \u2212 \u03c1r become shallower, showing\nthat a large kernel tends to smooth out the variations of\nsmall-scale environments. Since the main interest of this paper is the local environments that affect directly the properties of galaxies rather than the large-scale structure, we focus\non the small-scale environments by adopting the d5 kernel.\nFig. A3d and A4d display the local number density versus\n\nthe local luminosity density in the 2D and 3D estimation,\nshowing tight correlations with the ordinary least-squares\nbisector (Isobe et al. 1990) fit:\n2D\n\n3D\n\n\u03c1r = \u22122.635 \u00b1 0.002 log(2D \u03c1N /\u03c1\u0304N ) \u2212 14.731\n3D\n\n\u03c1r = \u22122.643 \u00b1 0.003 log( \u03c1N /\u03c1\u0304N ) \u2212 14.654\n\n(A2)\n(A3)\n\nwith \u03c1r -direction rms of 0.33 and 0.35 absolute-mag Mpc\u22123 ,\nrespectively. That is, the local luminosity density reflects\nwell the local number density overall, but there are typically\n\u03c1r dispersions of \u00b10.33 (\u00b10.35) mag Mpc\u22123 at fixed \u03c1N in\nthe 2D (3D) estimation.\n\n\fEnvironments of SDSS galaxy classes\n\n19\n\nFigure A4. The same as Fig. A3, but for the 3D local density indicators.\n\nA4\n\nCorrected Environmental Parameters\n\nThe local luminosity density and the local colour provide additional information that the local number density does not\nshow. However, there is one issue we should consider: \u03c1r and\n\u03c1u \u2212 \u03c1r include the information of the target galaxy itself. In\nthe local number density, this is not a significant problem,\nbecause the target galaxy itself is always counted as simply\none galaxy, which affects the zeropoint of the environmental parameter but does not cause any systematic distortion.\nOn the other hand, this may cause a significant distortion\nfor the local luminosity density and the local colour, because\ntarget galaxies have their own luminosity and colour ranging\nwidely.\nSuppose a target galaxy and its several neighbour galax-\n\nies and we calculate the local luminosity density and the local colour for the target galaxy. After that, we replace the\ntarget galaxy with a new one with quite different luminosity\nand colour. Then, the new local luminosity density and local colour may be different from the old values. However, the\nlocal environment has not changed actually, but it is only\nthe target galaxy that changed. Therefore, it is reasonable\nto exclude the information of the target galaxy itself when\nestimating the local luminosity density and the local colour,\nto investigate the environmental effects on the target galaxy.\nThe local number or mass density used by Park et al. (2007,\n2008) and Park & Choi (2009) excluded the contribution of\nthe target galaxy itself.\nFig. A5 and A6 compare the original environmental parameters (\u03c1r and \u03c1u \u2212 \u03c1r ) and the target-excluded environ-\n\n\f20\n\nJ.

In Fig. A5b,d,f and A6b,d,f, it\nseems that \u03c1r and \u03c1u \u2212\u03c1r strongly depend on the luminosity\nand colour of the target galaxy. However, such dependency\nbecomes very weak when the \u03c1r and \u03c1u \u2212 \u03c1r are replaced by\n\u03c1r \u2032 and \u03c1u \u2032 \u2212 \u03c1r \u2032 , the target-excluded environmental parameters, as shown in Fig. A5c,e,g and A6c,e,g. After excluding\nthe information of the target galaxy, the environmental pa-\n\nrameters have correlations with the target luminosity and\ncolour, as follows:\n2D\n\n\u03c1r \u2032 = 0.484 \u00d7 0.1KE Mpet (r) \u2212 5.171\n\n(A4)\n\n2D\n\n(\u03c1u \u2032 \u2212 \u03c1r \u2032 ) = 0.101 \u00d7 0.1K (u \u2212 r) + 2.091\n\n(A5)\n\n3D\n\n\u03c1r \u2032 = 0.480 \u00d7 0.1KE Mpet (r) \u2212 6.002\n\n(A6)\n\n3D\n\n(\u03c1u \u2032 \u2212 \u03c1r \u2032 ) = 0.077 \u00d7 0.1K (u \u2212 r) + 2.151,\n\n(A7)\n\nwhich show relatively weak dependence on the local envi-\n\n\fEnvironments of SDSS galaxy classes\n\nFigure A6.
