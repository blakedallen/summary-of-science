We define ex(n, G) to be the largest number of edges possible\nin a graph on n vertices that does not contain G as a subgraph; we call a graph on n vertices extremal if it\nhas ex(n, G) edges and does not contain G as a subgraph. EX(n, G) is the set of all extremal G-free graphs\non n vertices.\nThe problem of determining ex(n, G) (and EX(n, G)) for general n and G belongs to an area of graph\ntheory called extremal graph theory. Extremal graph theory officially began with Tur\u00e1n's theorem that solves\nEX(n, Km ) for all n and m, a result that is striking in its precision. In general, however, exact results for\nex(n, G) (and especially EX(n, G)) are very rare; most results are upper or lower bounds and asymptotic\nresults. For many bipartite G there is a large gap between upper and lower bounds.\nThe question of ex(n, C4 ) (where C4 is a cycle of length 4) has an interesting history; Erd\u0151s originally\nposed the problem in 1938, and the bipartite version of this problem was solved by Reiman using a construction derived from the projective plane (see [3] and the \u221a\nreferences therein for a more detailed history). Reiman\nalso determined the upper bound ex(n, C4 ) \u2264 n4 (1 + 4n \u2212 3) for general graphs, but this is known not to\nbe sharp [11]. Erd\u0151s, R\u00e9nyi, and S\u00f3s later showed that this is asymptotically correct using a construction\nknown as the Erd\u0151s-R\u00e9nyi graph derived from the orthogonal polarity graph of the classical projective plane\n[5] [6]. This is part of a more general family of graphs which we define below.\nLet \u03c0 be a finite projective plane with point set P and line set L. A polarity \u03c6 of \u03c0 is an involutionary\npermutation of P \u222a L which maps points to lines and lines to points and reverses containment. We call\npoints absolute when they are contained in their own polar image. A polarity is called orthogonal if there\nare exactly q + 1 absolute points. We define the polarity graph of \u03c0 to be the graph with vertex set P , with\ntwo distinct vertices x, y adjacent whenever x \u2208 \u03c6(y). The graph is called an orthogonal polarity graph if\nthe polarity is orthogonal. This graph is C4 -free, has q 2 vertices of degree q + 1, and q + 1 of degree q, for a\ntotal of 12 q(q + 1)2 edges.\nF\u00fcredi determined the first exact result that encompasses infinitely many n, namely that for q > 13 we\nhave ex(q 2 + q + 1, C4 ) \u2264 21 q(q + 1)2 [7] [8], with equality if and only if the graph is an orthogonal polarity\ngraph of a plane of order q. In particular, this shows ex(q 2 + q + 1, C4 ) = 12 q(q + 1)2 for all prime powers q.\nThe question of finding ex(n, C4 ) exactly for general n appears to be a difficult problem. Computer\nsearches by Clapham et al. [4] and Yuansheng and Rowlinson [12] determined EX(n, C4 ) for all n \u2264 31.\nMore general lower bounds are given in [1] by deleting carefully chosen vertices from the Erd\u0151s-R\u00e9nyi graph.\nIt is not known if any of these bounds are sharp in general. In particular it is not even known whether\ndeleting a single vertex of degree q from an orthogonal polarity graph graph yields a graph which is still\nextremal, a question posed by Lazebnik in 2003 [10]. More generally, is ex(q 2 + q, C4 ) \u2264 12 q(q + 1)2 \u2212 q? In\nthis paper we will prove the following theorem:\nTheorem 1. For q even, ex(q 2 + q, C4 ) \u2264 12 q(q + 1)2 \u2212 q.\nPreprint submitted to Elsevier\n\nAugust 6, 2018\n\n\fIt follows that equality holds for all q which are powers of 2.\nThe question of determining EX(q 2 + q, C4 ) in this case is subtler; the searches referred to above showed\nthat there are multiple constructions that achieve the bound for q = 2, 3, but for q = 4, 5 there is only one.\nIn a subsequent paper, we will prove the following:\nTheorem 2. For all but finitely many even q, any C4 -free graph with ex(q 2 + q, C4 ) edges is derived from\nan orthogonal polarity graph by removing a vertex of minimum degree.\nThe proof of this result is much more lengthy and complicated than that of the inequality in Theorem 1,\nand requires q to be sufficiently large. The purpose of this paper is to give a simpler proof of the inequality\nand show it holds for all even q. We start with some notation.\nWe let Xk be the set of vertices of degree k, X\u2264k be the set of vertices of degree at most k, E0 be\n1\nq(q\n+ 1)2 \u2212 q, and n be the number of vertices (q 2 + q). We will use \u0393(x) to represent the vertices in the\n2\nneighborhood of x. For our various lemmas, we will specify in each case whether q is an even number or\nsimply a positive integer; however, in all cases we consider q \u2265 6. (We know from [4] and [12] that the\ninequality in Theorem 1 is true for q \u2264 5.)\nIn general, we proceed indirectly. We will show that no C4 -free graph with E0 + 1 edges can exist,\nfrom which we conclude that a graph cannot have more than that number of edges (as it would contain an\nimpossible subgraph). We will use and generalize the techniques found in [7], [8], and [9].\nLemma 1. Let q be a natural number greater than 2 and let G be a C4 -free graph on q 2 + q vertices with at\nleast E0 edges. Then the maximum degree of a vertex in G is at most q + 2.\nProof. Let u be a vertex of G of maximum degree d. Let e be the number of edges of G, e \u2265 21 q(q + 1)2 \u2212 q.\nWe proceed by bounding the number of 2-paths in G which have no endpoints in \u0393(v). This gives us:\n\u0012\n\u0013 X\u0012\n\u0013\nn\u2212d\nd(v) \u2212 1\n\u2265\n2\n2\nv6=u\n\u0001\nUsing Jensen's inequality for the function f (x) = x2 we have:\n\u0012\n\u0013\nX \u0012d(v) \u2212 1\u0013\n(2e \u2212 (n \u2212 1) \u2212 d)/(n \u2212 1)\n\u2265 (n \u2212 1)\n2\n2\nv6=u\n\nMultiplying by 2(n \u2212 1)(q + 1) and simplifying yields:\n(q + 1)(n \u2212 1)(n \u2212 d)(n \u2212 d \u2212 1) \u2265 (q + 1)(2e \u2212 n \u2212 d + 1)(2e \u2212 2n \u2212 d + 2)\n\n(1)\n\nHowever, we also have:\n(q + 1)(2e \u2212 2n \u2212 d + 2) \u2212 (n \u2212 1)(n \u2212 d \u2212 1) \u2265 (q 2 \u2212 2)d \u2212 q 3 \u2212 2q 2 + q + 1\n\u2265 (q 2 \u2212 2)(q + 3) \u2212 q 3 \u2212 3q 2 + 1 \u2265 q 2 \u2212 q \u2212 5\n\nwith q 2 \u2212 q \u2212 5 > 0 for q > 2,\nwhich gives us:\n\n(q + 1)(2e \u2212 2n \u2212 d + 2) > (n \u2212 1)(n \u2212 d).\nWe also have the inequality:\n(2e \u2212 n \u2212 d + 1) \u2212 (q + 1)(n \u2212 d) \u2265 \u2212q 2 \u2212 3q + 1 + qd\n\u2265 \u2212q 2 \u2212 3q + 1 + q(q + 3) = 1 > 0,\n2\n\n(2)\n\n\fwhich demonstrates that:\n(2e \u2212 n \u2212 d + 1) > (q + 1)(n \u2212 d \u2212 1).\n\n(3)\n\nTherefore the product of (2) and (3) contradict (1), and the theorem follows.\nSince we now have an upper bound on the maximum degree of an extremal graph, we focus on the lower\nbound.\nTheorem 3. Let q be an even number and let G be a C4 -free graph on q 2 + q vertices, with maximum degree\nq + 1 or less. Then, if e denotes the number of edges of G, we have e \u2264 E0 . Furthermore, if equality holds,\nthen the degree sequence of G must be one of the following (where z is a parameter):\n|Xq+1 |\nq2 \u2212 q + z\nq2 \u2212 q + z + 1\n\n|Xq |\n2q \u2212 2z\n2q \u2212 2z \u2212 1\n\n|Xq\u22121 |\nz\nz\u22121\n\n|Xq\u22122 |\n0\n1\n\nProof. If the maximum degree of G is q or less, we have e \u2264 12 q(q 2 + q) \u2264 E0 and the theorem is immediate.\nTherefore, we take G to have maximum degree q + 1. It is clear that:\n|Xq+1 | + |Xq | + |X\u2264q\u22121 | = q 2 + q\nNoting that the degree sum of all the vertices of a graph is equal to 2e, we have:\n2e \u2264 (q + 1)|Xq+1 | + q|Xq | + (q \u2212 1)|X\u2264q\u22121 | = q(q 2 + q) + |Xq+1 | \u2212 |X\u2264q\u22121 |\n\n(4)\n\nLet v be a vertex of degree q + 1. We wish to bound the average degree of \u0393(v). We will do this by\nnoting that the collection\nC(v) of vertices distance 2 or less from v must naturally be less than q 2 + q. We\nS\nthen show that | w\u2208\u0393(v) \u0393(w)| + 1 \u2264 |C(v)|.\nEach vertex in \u0393(v) is connected to at most one other vertex in \u0393(v), as otherwise it would imply a C4 is\nin G. Also, since q + 1 is odd, there must be a vertex in \u0393(v) which is connected\nS to no other vertex in \u0393(v).\nRephrasing, this means that there is at least one vertex in C(v) that is not in w\u2208\u0393(v) \u0393(w). We also know\nthat for w, u \u2208 \u0393(v) we have \u0393(w) \u222a \u0393(u) = {v}, otherwise it again implies G has a C4 . We then have:\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\nX\n[\nd(w)\uf8f8 \u2212 q + 1 \u2264 |C(v)| \u2264 q 2 + q\n\u0393(w) + 1 = \uf8ed\nw\u2208\u0393(v)\n\nw\u2208\u0393(v)\n\nThen we have:\n\nP\n\nw\u2208\u0393(v) d(w)\n\nq+1\n\n\u2264\n\nq 2 + 2q \u2212 1\n2\n=q+1\u2212\nq+1\nq+1\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that if a vertex of degree q + 1 is connected to no vertex of degree q \u2212 1, then\nit must be connected to at least two vertices of degree q. Let A be the set of vertices of degree q + 1 which\nare connected to at least two vertices of Xq but no vertex of X\u2264q\u22121 , and B be the set of vertices of Xq+1\nconnected to at least one vertex of X\u2264q\u22121 . Let a = |A| and b = |B|. Naturally a + b = Xq+1 .\nWe consider the number of edges e\u2032 with one endpoint in A and the other in Xq . As each vertex of A is\nconnected to at least two vertices of Xq , and each vertex of Xq is connected to at most q vertices of Xq+1 ,\nwe have:\n\n\u2032\u2032\n\n2a \u2264 e\u2032 \u2264 q|Xq |\n\n(5)\n\nLet e be the number of edges with one endpoint in B and the other in X\u2264q\u22121 . As each vertex of B is\nconnected to at least one vertex of X\u2264q\u22121 and each vertex in X\u2264q\u22121 is connected to at most q \u2212 1 vertices\nin B, we have:\n3\n\n\fb \u2264 e\u2032\u2032 \u2264 (q \u2212 1)|X\u2264q\u22121 |\n\n(6)\n\nAdding twice (6) to (5) we get:\n2|Xq+1 | \u2264 q|Xq | + (2q \u2212 2)|X\u2264q\u22121 |\nAdding q|Xq+1 | to both sides we have:\n(q + 2)|Xq+1 | \u2264 q(|Xq+1 | + |Xq | + |X\u2264q\u22121 |) + (q \u2212 2)|X\u2264q\u22121 | = q 3 + q 2 + (q \u2212 2)|X\u2264q\u22121 |\nDividing both sides by (q+2) and expanding, we obtain:\n|Xq+1 | \u2264 q 2 \u2212 q + |X\u2264q\u22121 | \u2212\n\n4|X\u2264q\u22121 |\n4\n\u2212\n+2\nq+2\nq+2\n\nThis implies\n|Xq+1 | \u2212 |X\u2264q\u22121 | \u2264 q 2 \u2212 q + 1\nUsing this with (4) we have:\n2e \u2264 q 3 + q 2 + q 2 \u2212 q + 1\nSince q and 2e are even, we must have:\n1\nq(q + 1)2 \u2212 q\n2\nIf equality holds, then we have q 2 \u2212 q \u2264 |Xq+1 | \u2212 |X\u2264q\u22121 | \u2264 q 2 \u2212 q + 1 and 2e \u2264 (q + 1)|Xq+1 | + q|Xq | +\n(q \u2212 1)|X\u2264q\u22121 | \u2264 2e + 1. This implies that at most one of the vertices in X\u2264q\u22121 has degree q \u2212 2, and the\nrest have degree q \u2212 1. The remainder of the theorem follows.\ne\u2264\n\nIt is now clear that any graph with more than E0 edges must have maximum degree equal to q + 2. The\nrest of the paper is devoted to showing that no such graph exists. This is done by utilizing a connection\nbetween vertices of degree q + 2 and vertices of relatively small degree.\nLemma 2. If there is a C4 -free graph on n vertices and E0 + 1 edges (with q \u2208 N), then any vertex of degree\n\u03b4 \u2264 q2 + 1 connects to every vertex of degree q + 2.\nProof. Assume for the sake of contradiction that this statement is not true. Then there is a vertex v of\ndegree \u03b4 (where \u03b4 \u2264 2q + 1) and a vertex u of degree q + 2 such that u \u2241 v. Then we remove all \u03b4 edges\nin which v is incident and add a new edge from u to v, so that our graph now has e = E0 + 1 \u2212 \u03b4 edges, a\nvertex v of degree 1, and a vertex u of degree q + 3.\nNow we extend the lemma used in [7] concerning 2-paths containing no endpoints in \u0393(u), the neighbor\u0001\nhood of u. We know that we can bound the number of such 2-paths above with n\u2212d(u)\n, as there can be at\n2\nmost one 2-path between any pair of points not in \u0393(u). We also know that each vertex that is not u has at\nmost one neighbor in \u0393(u), which means that this inequality must hold:\n\u0012\n\u0013 X\u0012\n\u0013\nn \u2212 d(u)\nd(x) \u2212 1\n\u2265\n2\n2\nx6=u\n\nas the right side of that inequality is a lower bound on the number of actual 2-paths in the graph.\nTo actually calculate this, we first note that every 2-path involving v must have an endpoint in \u0393(u),\nwhich means that we can write\nX \u0012d(x) \u2212 1\u0013\nX \u0012d(x) \u2212 1\u0013\n=\n2\n2\nx6=u\n\nx6=u,v\n\n4\n\n\fIf we consider the total sum being chosen from (i.e.\n\nP\n\nx6=u,v\n\nd(x) \u2212 1) we get the number\n\n2e \u2212 (n \u2212 2) \u2212 (q + 3) \u2212 1\n(since the total degree sum is 2e and we subtract first the degrees of the two uncounted vertices and then 1\nfrom the remaining n \u2212 2 terms). We can thus use Jensen's inequality to obtain this expression:\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\u0012 2e\u2212(n\u22122)\u2212(q+3)\u22121 \u0013\nn \u2212 (q + 3)\nn\u22122\n\u2265 (n \u2212 2)\n2\n2\n\nNow we take\n\nq\n+1\n2\n(which corresponds to \u03b4 = 2q + 1). Since the left side is not dependent on e and the right side is, if the\ninequality fails for our chosen e then it will certainly fail for larger values e, which is equivalent to smaller\nvalues of \u03b4. When we expand and simplify the above inequality, we find it is equivalent to the following:\ne = E0 \u2212\n\n\u2212\n\n2q 3 \u2212 2q 2 \u2212 10q + 12\n\u22650\n(q 2 + q \u2212 2)\n\nwhich is not true for any relevant q.\nCorollary 1. For any q, if |Xq+2 | \u2265 2 in a C4 -free graph with E0 + 1 edges on n vertices, there can be only\none vertex v of degree 2q + 1 or less. In that case, |Xq+2 | \u2264 d(v).\nProof. The first part follows from the prior lemma and the fact that the graph is C4 -free; the second part\nfollows from the lemma and the first part of the corollary.\nLemma 3. The maximum number of 2-paths in a graph with n vertices and E0 + 1 edges (with q even) is\nqe \u2212 |Xq+1 | + 21 |Xq+2 |.\nProof. Since there can only be one 2-path between any \u0001two vertices (if there are more, there would be a C4\nin the graph), we can bound the number of 2-paths by n2 . However, this may be improved by bounding the\nnumber of pairs of vertices which are not the endpoints of a 2-path. We consider how many other vertices\ncannot be reached in two \u0001steps P\nfrom a given vertex, a function we\nP will denote by f (v). The exact number of\nf (v), so any lower bound on\nf (v) will in turn yield an upper bound on\n2-paths in the graph is n2 \u2212 12\nv\n\nv\n\nthe number ofP\n2-paths in the graph.\nTo bound\nf (v), we can compute what f (v) would be if v is connected only to vertices of degree q + 1,\nv\n\ngiving us a function we call g(v). This leads us to this table:\nd(v)\nq\u22122\nq\u22121\nq\nq+1\nq+2\n\ng(v)\n3q \u2212 1\n2q \u2212 1\nq\u22121\n1\n0\n\nAs a sample calculation, if d(v) = q then g(v) = q 2 + q \u2212 (1 + q * q) = q \u2212 1 because it has q neighbors that\neach have q neighbors other than v. The 1 corresponding to degree q + 1 comes from the fact that a vertex\nof degree q+1 must have one neighbor it cannot be connected to in a 2-path since (by assumption) q+1 is odd.\nStrictly speaking, the values of g(v) are not lower bounds on f (v), since there are also vertices of degree\nq + 2. In general, if v is adjacent to k vertices of degree q + 2, we have f (v) \u2265 g(v) \u2212 k. Then subtracting\n5\n\n\f(q + 2)|Xq+2 | from\n\nP\n\ng(v) gives us the bound\n\nv\n\nP\nv\n\nf (v) \u2265\n\nP\nv\n\ng(v) \u2212 (q + 2)|Xq+2 |. We note that, for d(v) \u2264 q,\n\ng(v) = q(q + 1 \u2212 d(v)) \u2212 1; for d(v) = q + 1, we must add 2 to that formula, while for d(v) = q + 2 we must\nadd q + 1.\nThis allows us to establish an upper bound on the number of 2-paths in the graph as follows:\n\u0012 2\n\u0013\n\u0012 \u0013\n1 X\nq +q\n1 X\nn\nf (v) \u2264\n(g(v) \u2212 |Xq+2 |)\n\u2212\n\u2212\n2\n2\n2\n2\nv\u2208V (G)\n\nv\u2208V (G)\n\nX\n1\n= [(q 2 + q)(q 2 + q \u2212 1) \u2212 (\n(q(q + 1 \u2212 d(v)) \u2212 1) + 2|Xq+1 | \u2212 |Xq+2 |)]\n2\nv\u2208V (G)\n\nX\n1\nd(v)]\n= [(q 2 + q)(q 2 + q \u2212 1) \u2212 |V (G)|(q 2 + q \u2212 1) \u2212 2|Xq+1 | + |Xq+2 | + q\n2\nv\u2208V (G)\n\n1\n= qe \u2212 |Xq+1 | + |Xq+2 |\n2\nand so we have our result.\nLemma 4. For any C4 -free graph G on n vertices with E0 + 1 edges (q even), \u03b4(G) >\n\nq\n2\n\n+ 1.\n\nProof. Assume for the sake of contradiction that there is a vertex v such that d(v) = \u03b4 \u2264 q2 + 1. We know\nfrom Lemma 2 and Corollary 1 that v is unique and v is connected to every vertex in Xq+2 . We also know\nfrom the Lemma 3 that this inequality must hold:\n\u0012\n\u0012\n\u0013 \u0012 \u0013\n\u0013\nX\nd(x)\nq+2\n\u03b4\n1\n+\n+\n(7)\nqe \u2212 |Xq+1 | + |Xq+2 | \u2265 |Xq+2 |\n2\n2\n2\n2\nx6=v,6\u2208Xq+2\n\nsince the right hand side is the total number of 2-paths in the graph.\nTake A to be the set of vertices that are neither v nor in Xq+2 . We wish to find the average degree of\nA, which we will denote by c. Since the maximum degree of any vertex in A is q + 1, c \u2264 q + 1. Moreover, c\nwill be minimized when the |Xq+2 | = \u03b4 = 2q + 1; in that case, we can calculate c:\nc=\n\n2(E0 + 1) \u2212 ( 2q + 1) \u2212 ( q2 + 1)(q + 2)\nn \u2212 ( 2q + 1 + 1)\n\nwhich yields c = q + 1 \u2212 2q4q\u22122\n2 +q\u22124 . Since the subtracted term is less than 1 for all q, q < c \u2264 q + 1.\nNow, clearly, for a fixed |Xq+2 | the left side of 7 is maximized when |Xq+1 | is minimized. We also wish\n\u0001\nP\nto minimize the term M = x\u2208A d(x)\n2 . If there is a vertex y of degree q \u2212 k (for some integer k \u2265 1), then\nwe know that we keep the same degree sum in A (which is fixed, since \u03b4 and |Xq+2 | are fixed) if we were to\ntake a vertex of degree q + 1, turn it into a vertex of degree q, and raise the degree of y by 1. Moreover, this\nwill actually decrease M , because of the following arithmetic:\n\u0012 \u0013 \u0012\n\u0013 \u0012\n\u0013 \u0012\n\u0013\nq\nq+1\nq\u2212k+1\nq\u2212k\n\u2212\n+\n\u2212\n= \u22122q + 2(q \u2212 k)\n2\n2\n2\n2\n= \u22122k < 0\nand so if there is a vertex of degree q \u2212 1 or less in A then M is not minimal.\nThus we see that both M and |Xq+1 | are minimized when every vertex in A has degree q or degree q + 1.\nThus, if 7 does not hold in that case, it cannot hold in any case. To obtain values for |Xq+1 | and |Xq |, we\nsolve this system of equations:\n|Xq+2 | + |Xq+1 | + |Xq | + 1 = n\n|Xq+2 |(q + 2) + |Xq+1 |(q + 1) + |Xq |q + \u03b4 = 2(E0 + 1)\n6\n\n\fwhich makes |Xq+1 | = q 2 + 2 \u2212 \u03b4 \u2212 2|Xq+2 | and |Xq | = q \u2212 3 + |Xq+2 | + \u03b4.\nWhen we plug those values into 7 and group terms in terms of \u03b4 we obtain this expression:\n1\n3\n3\n3\n1\n\u2212 \u03b4 2 + (q + )\u03b4 + |Xq+2 | \u2212 q \u2212 q 2 \u2212 2 \u2265 0\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\nSince, viewed as a function of \u03b4, that is a downward-opening quadratic, we know that the inequality will\nonly be true between the zeros of that function. Applying the quadratic formula to the expression yields\nthis equivalent expression:\nq\nq\n3\n1\n1\n3\n\u22127 + 12|Xq+2 | \u2265 \u03b4 \u2265 + q \u2212\n\u22127 + 12|Xq+2 |\n+q+\n2\n2\n2\n2\nand since we know that \u03b4 \u2265 |Xq+2 |, we know this must be true:\nq\n3\n1\n+q+\n\u22127 + 12|Xq+2 | \u2265 |Xq+2 |\n2\n2\nq\n3\n1\n+q+\n\u22127 + 12|Xq+2 | \u2212 |Xq+2 | \u2265 0\n2\n2\nSolving that inequality for |Xq+2 | yields a requirement that\np\n|Xq+2 | \u2265 3 + q \u2212 5 + 3q\n\nbut that (given our constraint that q be at least 6) implies |Xq+2 | >\nwhich contradicts our initial assumption. Therefore \u03b4(G) > q2 + 1.\n\nq\n2\n\n+ 1. That means that \u03b4 >\n\nq\n2\n\n+ 1,\n\nLemma 5. If G is a C4 -free graph on n vertices with E0 + 1 edges (with no restrictions on q), then any two\nvertices of degree q + 2 in G must share exactly one neighbor.\nProof. By way of contradiction, suppose that there exist two vertices u, v \u2208 G both of degree q+2 that share\nno neighbors. We will expand on a technique used by F\u00fcredi in [7] to consider 2-paths without endpoints in\neither \u0393(u) or \u0393(v). Denote this quantity by P . Let d = q + 2 be the degree of u and v.\n\u0001\nWe know that n\u2212d(x)\nis an upper bound for the number of 2-paths without endpoints in the neigh2\nborhood of a chosen vertex x with degree d(x), since every two vertices not in the neighborhood\nof x are\n\u0001\nendpoints of at most one 2-path. In our case, we have an upper bound on P of n\u22122d\nas\nwe\nare\nremoving\n2\ntwo disjoint neighborhoods\nd.\n\u0001\nP of degree\nNow, we know that w6=u,v d(w)\nis precisely the number of 2-paths with the central vertex not equal\n2\nto u, v, but we must subtract two from each degree\nP to account\u0001 for the possibility that a given w shares a\nneighbor with both u and v. Thus we find that w6=u,v d(w)\u22122\nis the lower bound for P , as it assumes all\n2\nvertices w share a neighbor with both u and v. We use Jensen's inequality to get the following result:\n\u0012\n\u0013\nX \u0012d(w) \u2212 2\u0013\n(2(E0 + 1) \u2212 2(n \u2212 2) \u2212 2d)/(n \u2212 2)\n\u2265 (n \u2212 2)\n.\n2\n2\nw6=u,v\n\nThen we have an inequality that must hold for the graph G to exist:\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\nn \u2212 2d\n(2(E0 + 1) \u2212 2(n \u2212 2) \u2212 2d)/(n \u2212 2)\n\u2212 1 \u2265 P \u2265 (n \u2212 2)\n.\n2\n2\nAfter simplifying and solving for q, we get the following inequality:\n\u2212q 4 \u2212 6q 3 + 17q 2 + 34q \u2212 48\n\u2265 0.\nq2 + q \u2212 2\nHowever, this inequality cannot hold for any q in the range we are concerned with. This contradiction shows\nthat u and v must share at least one neighbor, and we know they cannot share more than one because this\nwould create a C4 . This result implies that every pair of vertices of degree q + 2 must have exactly one\nneighbor in common.\n7\n\n\fLemma 6. If G is a C4 -free graph on n vertices with E0 + 1 edges (where q can be even or odd), any two\nvertices of degree q + 2 must share a neighbor of degree d < 2q .\nProof. We know from the previous lemma that two vertices of degree q+2 must have a neighbor in common.\nConsider two such vertices x and y, and let their unique common neighbor be u. By adapting the argument\nof the previous lemma and applying it to B = \u0393(x) \u222a \u0393(y), i.e. looking at P \u2032 , the number of 2-paths with\nno endpoints in B, we obtain the following inequality:\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\nX\nX \u0012d(u) \u2212 2\u0013\nd(u) \u2212 1\nn \u2212 2(q + 2) + 1\n+\n\u2265\n2\n2\n2\nv\u2208\u0393(u),v6=x,y\n\nv6\u2208\u0393(u)\n\nWe see the left hand side is an upper bound on P \u2032 ; we add 1 back in to the number of vertices used in\n2-paths because of the intersection between \u0393(x) and \u0393(y). The right hand side is separated into two sums.\nThe first summation sums over all vertices v not in the neighborhood of vertex u, and relies on the fact that\nv can connect to at most 1 one other vertex in the neighborhood of each of the q + 2 vertices before creating\na C4 . The second summation is over all vertices w \u2208 \u0393(u) and comes from the fact that w can connect to at\nmost 1 other vertex in the union of the neighborhoods of the two q + 2 vertices before creating a C4 .\nWe use Jensen's inequality on the right hand side to obtain the following expression:\n\u0012 2e\u22122(q+2)\u22122(n\u22122)+d(u)\u22122 \u0013\nX \u0012d(w) \u2212 1\u0013\nX \u0012d(v) \u2212 2\u0013\nn\u22122\n\u2265 (n \u2212 2)\n+\n2\n2\n2\n\nv6\u2208\u0393(u)\n\nw\u2208\u0393(u)\n\n(We subtract 2 because we should not count x and y for u's total.)\nClearly, if this inequality fails for a given value of d(u), it must fail for any larger value, since the right\nside increases with d(u) and the left side is static. Thus, we plug in 2q , which yields the following expression:\n\u2212\n\n6q 3 \u2212 25q 2 \u2212 28q + 96\n\u22650\n8q 2 + 8 \u2212 16\n\nThat inequality fails for all relevant q, thus the statement is proven.\nCorollary 2. If q is even, any C4 -free graph with E0 + 1 edges and n vertices has exactly one vertex of\ndegree q + 2.\nProof. This follows from the three previous lemmas.\nHaving reduced the hypothetical counterexamples to a single case, we proceed with the proof of the\ntheorem.\nTheorem 4. For q even, ex(q 2 + q, C4 ) \u2264 12 q(q + 1)2 \u2212 q.\nProof. We know from Corollary 2 that we must consider only the case when |Xq+2 | = 1. It is clear that\nany graph G with n vertices, E0 + 1 edges, and |Xq+2 | = 1 can only be created by taking a graph G\u2032 with\nE0 edges and \u2206(G) = q + 1 and connecting a vertex of degree q + 1 to a vertex of strictly lower degree. We\nknow from Lemma 3 that G\u2032 can have one of two possible degree sequences up to a parameter z. When we\nexamine all the ways to make the necessary connection, we get these four possible degree sequences for G:\nA\nB\nC\nD\n\n|Xq+2 |\n1\n1\n1\n1\n\n|Xq+1 |\nq2 \u2212 q + z\nq2 \u2212 q + z\nq2 \u2212 q + z + 1\nq2 \u2212 q + z \u2212 1\n\n|Xq |\n2q \u2212 2z \u2212 1\n2q \u2212 2z\n2q \u2212 2z \u2212 2\n2q \u2212 2z + 1\n\n8\n\n|Xq\u22121 |\nz\nz\u22122\nz\u22121\nz\u22121\n\n|Xq\u22122 |\n0\n1\n1\n0\n\n\fSince we have a specific degree sequence, we can use Lemma 3 concerning the total number of 2-paths in\nG to generate the following inequality:\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\nq+2\nqe \u2212 |Xq+1 | + |Xq+2 | \u2265 |Xq+2 |\n2\n2\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012 \u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\nq+1\nq\nq\u22121\nq\u22122\n+ |Xq+1 |\n+ |Xq |\n+ |Xq\u22121 |\n+ |Xq\u22122 |\n2\n2\n2\n2\nWhen we solve that inequality for z, we get the following results:\nA\nB\nC\nD\n\nz \u2264 \u2212 41\nz \u2264 \u2212 43\nz \u2264 \u2212 47\nz\u2264\n\n3\n4\n\nObviously, these values of z lead to impossible degree sequences, thus no such G is possible.\nAcknowledgements\nThis research was conducted at an NSF Research Experience for Undergraduates (grant number\nDMS-0755450) at the University of Wyoming in the summer of 2011.
