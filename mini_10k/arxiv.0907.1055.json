Investigating the experimental isotope shifts in Kr isotopes near the proton drip-line, we have\ndiscovered that N = Z rp-process nuclei\n\n68 Se, 72 Kr, 76 Sr\n\nand\n\n80 Zr\n\nexhibit a significant shell gap\n\nboth at the proton and neutron numbers in the deformed space with the consequence that pairing\ncorrelations for protons and neutrons vanish, thus lending a double-magic character to these nuclei.\nA significant number of nuclei in this region are also shown to exhibit neutron magicity at N =\n34, 36, 38, and 40 in the deformed space.\nPACS numbers: 21.10.Ft, 21.60.Cs, 21.60.Jz, 26.30.-k, 26.30.Hj, 27.50.+e\n\n1\n\n\fIn rapid-proton-capture (rp-process) in x-ray bursters, N = Z nuclei above Ni (Z = 28)\nare understood to play an important role in producing a part of x-ray flux [1, 2, 3]. A number\nof these nuclei are considered to be waiting-point due to inability of these nuclei to capture\na proton, thus hindering the rp-process. Consequently, peaks in abundances of the N = Z\nnuclei\n\n68\n\nSe,\n\n72\n\nKr,\n\n76\n\nSr and\n\n80\n\nZr among others have been shown to arise in astrophysical\n\nrp-process in x-ray bursters [2].\nPrecise measurements [4, 5, 6, 7] of nuclear masses have established the waiting-point\ncharacter of the N = Z nuclei\n\n68\n\nSe,\n\n72\n\nKr,\n\n76\n\nSr, and\n\n80\n\nZr. On\n\n64\n\nGe, however, there is\n\nno consensus as yet whether it is a waiting-point nucleus [8]. Negative values of Qp for\na proton capture are cited as evidence for the waiting-point character of nuclei. This is\ninteresting, since no known magic number is present in this region in contrast to waitingpoint nuclei arising due to the major magic numbers along the r-process path. This poses a\ntheoretical challenge to understand the structure of the waiting-point nature of rp-process\nnuclei responsible for x-ray bursts.\nThe structure of these nuclei is far from certain. What is known is that nuclei in this region\nare highly deformed [9, 10, 11] until the major magic number approaches at Z = N = 50\nwhere the rp-process is predicted to terminate [2]. In this letter, we examine the experimental\nisotope shifts in proton-rich Kr nuclei near the rp-process path within the framework of the\nrelativistic Hartree-Bogoliubov theory in deformed space. Consequently, we report on the\ndouble-magic structure that we have discerned for N = Z nuclei near the rp-process path.\nIsotope shifts in nuclei reveal shell effects across a major shell gap [12], for instance,\nfor the Pb isotopes in terms of a kink about the magic number [13]. For other isotopic\nchains such as Kr and Sr, such a behavior is shrouded by deformation of nuclei. In this\nwork, we investigate the isotope shifts \u2206rc2 in Kr nuclei. The experimental values (with\nN = 50 as a reference point) for the chain are known for isotopes down to N = 36 with a\nsignificant precision from laser spectroscopy measurements [14] (see Fig 1). The nuclide 72 Kr\n(N = 36) is very close to the proton drip line. The salient feature of these data (Fig. 1) is the\nmonotonous increase of \u2206rc2 from N = 50 down to N = 40 due to an increasing deformation\nin going to the lighter isotopes. A similar feature is seen for isotopes heavier than N = 50.\nHowever, the most interesting feature that is demonstrated by the experimental data is that\n\u2206rc2 for\n\n74\n\nKr is nearly zero and that it becomes strongly negative for\n\n72\n\nKr. The magnitude\n\nof the isotope shift or in other words, the charge radius of a nucleus with respect to that of\n2\n\n\fthe reference nucleus is mainly reflective of the deformation of a nucleus. To the first order,\nit can be approximated as\n\u2206rc2 = hrc2 is\n\n5 2\n\u03b4\u03b2 ,\n4\u03c0 2\n\n(1)\n\nwhere hrc2 is is the mean-square charge radius of the spherical nucleus and \u03b22 is the quadrupole\ndeformation of the deformed one. This excludes any effects due to shell structure. The\ndownward trend of the experimental isotope shift below N = 40 whilst retaining \u03b22 in the\nsame range would imply a structural factor. Here, we investigate this factor that leads to a\ndecreasing or even a negative isotope shift.\nWe examine the isotope shifts of Kr nuclei within the framework of the relativistic meanfield theory. In this work, we employ the standard RMF Lagrangian with the exchange\nof \u03c3, \u03c9 and \u03c1 mesons between the nucleons. The corresponding Lagrangian density which\ndescribes the nucleons as Dirac spinors moving in meson fields is given by\n1\n/ \u2212 g\u03c3 \u03c3 \u2212 MN \u03c8\nL = \u03c8\u0304 /p \u2212 g\u03c9 /\u03c9 \u2212 g\u03c1 \u03c1\n/~~\u03c4 \u2212 e(1 \u2212 \u03c43 )A\n2\n1\n1\n1\n+ \u2202\u03bc \u03c3\u2202 \u03bc \u03c3 \u2212 U(\u03c3) \u2212 \u03a9\u03bc\u03bd \u03a9\u03bc\u03bd + m2\u03c9 \u03c9\u03bc \u03c9 \u03bc\n2\n4\n2\n1 ~ ~ \u03bc\u03bd 1 2\n1\n1\n\u03bc 2\n+ g4 (\u03c9\u03bc \u03c9 ) \u2212 R\u03bc\u03bd R + m\u03c1 \u03c1~\u03bc \u03c1~\u03bc \u2212 F\u03bc\u03bd F \u03bc\u03bd .\n2\n4\n2\n4\n\u0013\n\n\u0012\n\n(2)\n\nU(\u03c3) represents the conventional nonlinear \u03c3 potential. This Lagrangian includes the vector\nself-coupling of \u03c9-meson represented by the coupling constant g4 . In this work, we employ\nthe Lagrangian set NL-SV1 with the vector self-coupling of \u03c9 meson. The force NL-SV1\nwas developed with a view to soften the high-density equation of state of nuclear matter\nand has been shown to improve the shell effects of nuclei along the stability line [15].\nDeformed RMF+BCS calculations have been performed using an expansion of fermionic\nand bosonic wavefunctions in 20 oscillator shells. The pairing is included using the constant\ngap approximation with pairing gap being taken from the widely used prescription of \u2206n(p) =\n4.8N \u22121/3 (Z \u22121/3 ) for open-shell nuclei [16]. The results of RMF+BCS calculations of charge\nradii obtained with NL-SV1 are shown in Fig. 1. The isotope shifts thus obtained show an\nincreasing trend in going below N = 50 except for N = 44 where the experimental data is\nunderestimated by the theory due to a relatively smaller deformation \u03b22 \u223c 0.10 as compared\nto its neighbors. The experimental values are reproduced satisfactorily down to N = 40 as\nwell as above N = 50. However, for the isotopes\n\n74\n\nKr (N = 38) and\n\n72\n\nKr (N = 36), there\n\nis a strong divergence of the theoretical values from the experimental data, though \u03b22 of\n3\n\n\fthese nuclei is significantly larger than that for\n\n76\n\nKr (N = 40). The isotope shift for\n\n70\n\nKr\n\n(N = 34) shows a further increase. Experimental datum does not exist for this isotope.\nTheoretically, the rapid increase in the charge radius of\n\n74\n\nKr,\n\n72\n\nKr and\n\n70\n\nKr appears\n\nnaturally as a consequence of the vicinity to the proton drip line. The BCS smearing of\noccupation probabilities across the Fermi surface which adjoins the continuum leads to a\nswelling of the charge radius. Evidently, a BCS description of nuclei close to the proton\ndrip line runs contrary to the experimental data. The isotope shifts of Kr and Sr isotopes\nwere investigated in a previous work [17] within the RMF+BCS formalism. Calculations\nperformed with 12 oscillator shells gave rise to an apparently good agreement with the data\n[17]. This agreement is, however, fortuitous, for 12 shells do not suffice to encompass the\nconfiguration space and hence underestimate the charge radii of neutron-deficient nuclei\nsignificantly.\n\nIsotope shifts: Kr nuclei (Z=36)\n\u03b2 \u22120.34\n0.0\n\u22120.18\n0.10\n0.06\n\u22120.34\n0.14\n\u22120.20\n0.12\n0.0\n\n2\n0.6 \u22120.30\n\n2\n\n\u2206rc (fm )\n\n0.4\n\n2\n\n0.2\n\n0.0\nNL\u2212SV1 (BCS)\nNL\u2212SV1 (RHB)\nNL3 (RHB)\nexpt\n\n\u22120.2\n34\n\n38\n\n42\n\n46\n\n50\n\n54\n\nN\nFIG. 1: The isotope shifts \u2206rc2 of Kr chain obtained from deformed RMF+BCS and RHB calculations with NL-SV1.

The experimental data [14] for \u2206rc2 are shown for comparison.\nThe results with NL3 are also shown.\n\n4\n\n\fNotwithstanding the stark disagreement of the RMF+BCS calculations with the experimental isotope shifts, we have undertaken an inclusion of the pairing mechanism based upon\nBogoliubov quasi-particle scheme in a deformed basis with a view to take into account the\neffects due to coupling of the Fermi surface to the continuum.

This is transformed to the canonical basis to obtain\nthe desired observables. We have used the Gogny force D1S [18] for the pairing channel\nas in other works [19]. We have adjusted the strength of the pairing force in order to get\na good agreement of the calculated binding energies with the experimental values for the\nchain of Sn isotopes. The superfluid Sn nuclei provide a best testing ground for calibration\nof the pairing strength. Consequently, the force NL-SV1 describes the ground-state binding\nenergies over a large range of Sn isotopes very well.\nDeformed RHB calculations with the pairing channel thus calibrated have been performed\nfor the Kr isotopes using an expansion of Dirac spinors and mesons fields into 20 shells of\nan axially deformed oscillator potential. In each case, minimizations have been sought in\nthe oblate and prolate regions of deformation. It is noticed that there is a shape-coexistence\nbetween an oblate and a prolate shape for several isotopes. The RHB calculations with\n\n5\n\n\fNL-SV1 provide a good description of the ground-state binding energies of Kr isotopes with\na few divergences within 0.20%.\nThe results obtained on the isotope shifts with NL-SV1 with the deformed RHB are\nshown in Fig. 1. The RHB results from N = 48 towards N = 40 show an improvement\nover the BCS values including that for N = 44. The most interesting outcome of these\ncalculations is the downward trend that arises for the isotopes below N = 40, a picture that\ncontrasts sharply with the BCS pairing. NL-SV1 overestimates the isotope shift (charge\nradius) of\n\n72\n\nKr (N = 36) slightly. This is due perhaps to a slightly higher deformation\n\n(\u03b22 = \u22120.34) obtained theoretically than is the case. There is no datum on\n\n70\n\nKr. We\n\npredict a negative isotope shift for this nucleus. Results obtained with the set NL3 also\nreproduce the downward trend. The NL3 results, however, overestimate the experimental\ndata.\nThe case of\n\n72\n\nKr is noteworthy. It is a N = Z nucleus that participates significantly\n\nin the rp-process. The Nilsson splitting of j-levels especially near the Fermi surface carves\nout a major shell gap both at N = 36 and Z = 36. Our results with the deformed RHB\ncalculations show that pairing correlations vanish completely for protons and neutrons alike.\nThis renders the nucleus 72 Kr as doubly magic in the deformed space. Thus, in spite of being\nclose to the proton drip line, the absence of smearing engenders the decrease in the charge\nradius in stark contrast to the BCS result (see Fig. 1).\nThe isotopes\n\n70\n\nKr and\n\n74\n\nKr emerge with a major shell gap with vanishing pairing at the\n\nrespective neutron numbers N = 34 and N = 36 in the ground state, thus exhibiting a\nneutron magicity only. This is, to a large extent, responsible for suppressing the charge\nradius of these isotopes.\nWith the advent of the double magicity in\n\n72\n\nKr, we have also explored other N = Z rp-\n\nprocess nuclei. Results of the deformed RHB calculations with NL-SV1 show that not only\n72\n\nKr, but also the other N = Z nuclei such as 68 Se, 76 Sr and 80 Zr exhibit larger shell gaps both\n\nat the respective neutron and proton numbers. In these nuclei pairing correlations vanish\ncompletely for neutrons and protons, which characterizes these nuclei also as doubly magic.\nThus, the nuclei\n\n68\n\nSe,\n\n72\n\nKr, 76 Sr and 80 Zr with N = Z = 34, 36, 38, and 40, respectively, are\n\nendowed with a double magicity in the deformed space. It may be remarked that though\ndeformed shell gaps at some of these N and Z numbers have been indicated in the literature\n(e.g. ref. [20]), these shell gaps have never been shown to qualify for a magicity.\n6\n\n\fProton Nilsson levels (g.s.): N=Z nuclei\n\n0\n\n72\n\n76\n\nSr 80Zr 84Mo 88Ru 92Pd\n\u03b22\n0.23 \u22120.26 \u22120.34 0.48 0.49 \u22120.21 \u22120.21 0.12\n64\n\nGe\n\n68\n\nSe\n\nKr\n\n\u03b5p (MeV)\n\n32 34 36 38\n\n40 42 44 46\n\n\u22125\n\n26\n\n28\n28 28\n28 30\n\n\u221210\n\n30\n\n30\n\n\u221215\nFIG. 2: Proton single-particle levels for the ground-state of N = Z nuclei obtained with deformed\nRHB approach using the force NL-SV1.

The larger shell gaps at N and Z = 34, 36, 38, and 40 can be\nseen conspicuously for the aforesaid N = Z nuclei. The corresponding \u03b22 for the groundstate is indicated in the upper part of the figures. It is noteworthy that 76 Sr and 80 Zr exhibit\na large prolate deformation in the ground state. This is consistent with the experimental\nvalues deduced [21, 22].\nThe case of\n\n68\n\nSe deserves a mention. This nucleus has been shown experimentally to be\n\na waiting-point nucleus beyond doubt [7]. Our results show that this nucleus has a second\nminimum with a prolate shape within 0.5 MeV of the oblate ground-state, thus exhibiting\na shape-coexistence. Interestingly, the single-particle structure of the prolate state also\nexhibits a doubly magic character. In comparison,\n\n64\n\nGe (N = Z = 32) shows shell gaps in\n\nneutrons and protons which can not be construed as a magic number.

Nuclei with the vanishing pairing correlations (neutron\nmagicity) are highlighted in columns 2-5.\n\npairing energy for neutrons and protons is non-zero albeit significantly reduced as compared\nto a normal superfluid nucleus. Other N = Z nuclei such as 84 Mo, 88 Ru, and 92 Pd also show\na well-deformed shape in the ground state and a shell gap both in protons and neutrons near\nthe Fermi surface similar in magnitude to that in\n\n64\n\nGe with non-zero and yet significantly\n\nreduced pairing correlations. These nuclei are also in contention for being waiting-point\nnuclei experimentally [1]. However, our results do not lend a doubly-magic character to\nthese nuclei.\nWe have examined the single-particle structure of other nuclei in the vicinity of the rpprocess path from N = Z = 32-40. Deformed RHB calculations have been performed for\nsets of nuclei as shown in Fig. 4. As is prevalent in this region, ground state of nuclei\nleads to a significant deformation for most of the nuclei explored. Some cases also show\na shape-coexistence between an oblate and a prolate shape. Details of this study will be\npresented elsewhere. In Fig. 4 we show the nuclei which exhibit a neutron and/or a proton\n\n8\n\n\fFIG. 4: The chart of N = Z nuclei exhibiting double magicity along the rp-process path.

The four N = Z nuclei\n\n68\n\nSe,\n\n72\n\nKr,\n\n76\n\nSr, and\n\n80\n\nZr with double magicity stand out\n\nconspicuously.\nWe note that there is a preponderance of neutron magicity at several neutron numbers.\nThis includes isotones with N = 34, 36, 38 and to a limited extent with N = 40. Surprisingly,\na large number of nuclei in this region are amenable to a larger neutron shell gap at the\nFermi surface in the Nilsson scheme with the vanishing pairing correlations. A few cases with\nsignificantly reduced neutron pairing correlations at N = 32, 36 and 40 with the pairing\nenergy of \u223c \u22121 to \u22122 MeV are also shown in Fig. 4. In contrast, there are no cases of\nproton magicity found other than those of four N = Z doubly magic nuclei. Comparatively,\nthe isotopes of\n\n64\n\nGe,\n\n66\n\nGe (Z = 32) and\n\n70\n\nSe (Z = 34) exhibit proton shell gaps with non-\n\nzero yet significantly reduced proton pairing energy. Thus, proton magicity in this region is\nrather subdued as compared to neutrons.\nIt is interesting to note that peaks in abundances of masses at A = 64, 68, 72, 76, and\n80 were obtained in rp-process calculations [2] in an x-ray burst, testifying to an important\nrole played by the N = Z = 32-40 nuclei. A double magicity of nuclei found in our work will\n9\n\n\freinforce the waiting-point character to its namesake. It would be interesting to investigate\nas to how this attribute would influence the \u03b2-decay half-lives of nuclei and what would its\neffect on x-ray flux emanating from x-ray binaries be?\nIn conclusion, on the basis of our investigation of the experimental isotope shifts of Kr\nnuclei near the proton drip-line within the framework of the relativistic Hartree-Bogoliubov\napproach, we have found that N = Z rp-process waiting-point nuclei\nand\n\n80\n\n68\n\nSe,\n\n72\n\nKr,\n\n76\n\nSr,\n\nZr exhibit double magicity in the deformed space. It is also shown that there is a\n\npreponderance of nuclides exhibiting a neutron magicity at N = 34, 36, 38 and 40 in this\nregion.\nOne of the authors (MMS) thanks Hendrik Schatz for useful discussions.
