The dynamics of the system is described by a coupled map lattice with\nnear neighbor interactions. The evolution of each agent results from the competition\nbetween two factors: the agent's own tendency to grow and the environmental influence that moderates this growth. Depending on the values of the parameters that\ncontrol these factors, the system can display Pareto or Boltzmann-Gibbs statistical\nbehaviors in its asymptotic dynamical regime. The regions where these behaviors\nappear are calculated on the space of parameters of the system. Other statistical\nproperties, such as the mean wealth, the standard deviation, and the Gini coefficient\ncharacterizing the degree of equity in the wealth distribution are also calculated on\nthe space of parameters of the system.\nKey words: Multi-agent systems.

This means that the society\ncan be differentiated in two disjoint populations in which the probability distribution of wealth has a different functional form in each of them [1,2,3,4,5].\nAnalysis of real economic data from U.K. and U.S.A. [6] has shown that one\nphase possesses an exponential or Boltzmann-Gibbs probability distribution\nthat involves about 95% of individuals, mainly those with low and medium\nwealths, and that the other phase, consisting of the the 5% of individuals\nPreprint submitted to Elsevier\n\n28 October 2018\n\n\fwith highest wealths, shows a power law distribution or Pareto behavior. Several economic models based on diverse probabilistic mechanisms for interaction between agents have been proposed in order to reproduce these types of\nstatistical behavior [7,8,9,10,11]. However, in most cases, both classes of distributions do not appear in a simple model; changes in the interaction rules\nbetween agents are required in order to obtain either type of behavior.\nRandomness is an essential ingredient in all the former models. Thus, agents\nbehave as a classical gas without notion of locality [5]. The interaction between\nagents occurs in pairs chosen at random, and these pairs exchange a random\nquantity of wealth in each transaction; this leads to an asymptotic state where\nthe wealth in the system follows a Boltzmann-Gibbs distribution. The transition from a Boltzmann-Gibbs distribution to a Pareto behavior requires a\nchange of structural properties of the system. A power law distribution can be\nreached, for instance, by introducing a strong inhomogeneity in the properties\nof the agents [4,10]. Thus, very different setups are needed in those models\nin order to simulate the collective behavior of real economic systems. On the\nother hand, interactions among real economic agents cannot be regarded as\nfully random. In fact, most economic transactions are driven by some kind of\nmutual interests or rational forces.\nIn this article, we study the statistical properties of a recently introduced\ndeterministic, network-based multi-agent dynamical model possessing minimal ingredients [12]. In particular, we show that this simple model is capable\nof displaying Boltzmann-Gibbs as well as Pareto statistical behaviors in its\nasymptotic states.\nThe system consists of N agents placed at the nodes of a network. Each agent,\nrepresenting an individual, a company, a country or other economic entity,\nis identified by an index i, with i = 1, . . . , N. The dynamics of each agent\nis described by a discrete-time map that expresses the competition between\nits own tendency to grow and an environmental influence that controls this\ngrowth. Although the model can be defined on any network of interacting\nagents, for simplicity we shall consider here a one-dimensional lattice with\nperiodic boundary conditions. The dynamics of the system is described by the\ncoupled map equations [12]\nxit+1 = ri xit exp(\u2212 | xit \u2212 ai \u03a8it |),\n\u03a8it =\n\n1\n(xi\u22121\nt\n2\n\n(1)\n\n+ xi+1\nt ),\n\nwhere xit \u2265 0 gives the state of the agent i at discrete time t, and it may\ndenote the wealth of this agent; the factor ri xit expresses the self-growth capacity of agent i, characterized by a parameter ri ; \u03a8it represents the local field\nacting at the site i at time t; and ai measures the coupling of agent i with its\n2\n\n\f1\n\n(a)\n\n-1\n\n10\n\n-2\n\n10\n\nP(x)\n\n-3\n\n10\n\n-4\n\n10\n\n-5\n\n10\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n10\nAgent wealth (x)\n\n12\n\n14\n\n16\n\n1\n\n(b)\n\n-1\n\n10\n\n-2\n\n10\n\nP(x)\n\n-3\n\n10\n\n-4\n\n10\n\n-5\n\n10\n\n1\n\n10\nAgent wealth (x)\n\n100\n\nFig. 1.

(b) Log-log plot of P (x) at time\nt = 104 , for a = 0.92 and r = 8.\n\nneighborhood; it can also be interpreted as the local environmental pressure\nexerted on agent i [13]. The negative exponential function acts as a control\nfactor that limits this growth with respect to the local field. With the dynamics given by Eqs.(1) the largest possibility of growth for agent i is obtained\nwhen xit \u2243 ai \u03a8it , i.e., when the agent has reached some kind of adaptation to\nits local environment.\nFor simplicity, in this paper we focus on a homogeneous system where all\nagents possess the same growth capacity, ri = r, and are subject to a uniform selection pressure from their environment, ai = a. Thus, the parameter\na expresses the homogeneous wish of the agents to reach a wealth level proportional to that of their environment. The value a = 1 means a desire of\nbeing totally balanced with the neighborhood. The case a < 1 could be interpreted as some kind of lack of attitude in the population for improving its\nrelative wealth. When a > 1 the agents possess an excess of will (selfishness)\nfor overcoming their local neighbors.\nWe study the collective behavior of the system described by Eqs.(1) in the\nspace of parameters (a, r). For all the simulations shown, the system size is\nN = 105 and the values of the initial conditions are uniformly distributed at\nrandom in the interval xi0 \u2208 [1, 100]. Also, a transient of 104 iterations is discarded before arriving to the asymptotic regime where all the calculations are\ncarried out. When indicated, time averages are done over the next 100 iterations after the transient, and this result is newly averaged over 100 different\nrealizations of the initial conditions with the same process.\nFigure 1 shows the probability distribution of the states of the agents P (x)\nat time t = 104 for different values of the parameters a and r. In Fig. 1(a),\na semilog plot of P (x) shows that, for the parameters used, the probability\n3\n\n\f-0,94\n\n(a)\n-0,95\n\n-0,96\n\n\u03b2 -0,97\n-0,98\n\n-0,99\n\n-1\n0\n\n0,2\n\n0,4\n\n0,6\n\n0,8\n\n0,4\n\n0,6\n\n0,8\n\n1\n\n1,2\n\n1,4\n\n1,6\n\n1,8\n\n2\n\n1\n\n1,2\n\n1,4\n\n1,6\n\n1,8\n\n2\n\na\n\n-0,94\n\n(b)\n-0,95\n\n-0,96\n\n\u03b2 -0,97\n-0,98\n\n-0,99\n\n-1\n0\n\n0,2\n\na\n\nFig. 2.

The values of \u03b2 shown are the\nresult of averaging the values obtained over 100 iterations for each parameter values,\nafter discarding 104 transients. (a) r = 4. (b) r = 8.\n\ncan be well described by a Boltzmann-Gibbs distribution P (x) \u223c e\u2212\u03bcx , where\n\u03bc = 0.59. A thermodynamical simile can be established by defining a kind of\n'temperature', h = 1/\u03bc = 1.69, that is related with the mean wealth of the\nagents in the ensemble. For other values of the parameters, P (x) can display\na Pareto-type behavior, as shown in the log-log plot of Fig. 1(b). In this case,\nP (x) \u223c x\u2212\u03b1 , with an exponent \u03b1 = 2.84, a value in agreement with the\nexponents derived from real economic data [1,14,15].\nThe exponents \u03bc and \u03b1 in the distributions shown in Fig. 1 are obtained by\nlinear regression using the least-squares method; this gives a value of the correlation coefficient greater than 0.98 in each case. Boltzmann-Gibbs and Pareto\ndistributions also appear for other values of the parameters (a, r). Figure 2\nshows the correlation coefficient \u03b2 corresponding to the semilog fitting of the\nBoltzmann-Gibbs as well as the log-log fitting of the Pareto distributions as\na function of the parameter a, for two different values of r. We consider that\neither of these fittings are accurate enough when |\u03b2| > 0.96.

When the value of a increases, the population enters\nin a competitive regime that provokes the appearance of the Pareto behavior in\nthe system. The scaling exponents obtained for the Pareto behavior observed\nin Fig. 3(b) are in the range \u03b1 \u2208 [2.3, 3.0]; these values are similar to those\nfound in actual economic data [1,14,15].\nThe mean field of the system or average wealth per agent at a time t is defined\nas\nN\n1 X\nxit ,\nHt =\nN i\n\n(2)\n\n5\n\n\f15\n14\n13\n12\n11\nr\n10\n9\n8\n7\n6\n\n3\n\n(a)\n\n2.5\n2\n\nP\n\n1.5\n1\n\nP\nBG\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\n1.2\n\n1.4\n\n1.6\n\n1.8\n\n2\n\na\n15\n14\n13\n12\n11\nr\n10\n9\n8\n7\n6\n\n6\n\n(b)\n\n4\n\nP\n\n2\n0\n\nP\nBG\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\n1.2\n\n1.4\n\n1.6\n\n1.8\n\n2\n\na\n\nFig. 4.

Note that, although the values of the initial states of the agents\nare randomly distributed on the interval [1, 100], the system evolves to an\nasymptotic state where Ht takes values on the smaller interval [0, 3]. On the\nother hand, for some values of the parameters a and r, the states of agents\nin the system at a given time exhibit a large dispersion. Similarly, for those\nparameters, the values of the state of any agent present large fluctuations over\nlong times. To characterize these fluctuations, we define the instantaneous\nstandard deviation of the mean field as\n\u03c3t =\n\nN h\ni2\n1 X\nxit \u2212 Ht\nN i=1\n\n!1/2\n\n.\n\n(3)\n\nAfter discarding 104 transients, we calculate the mean value of \u03c3t over 100\niterations, and then average this result over 100 realizations of initial conditions. The resulting average dispersion, denoted by h\u03c3i, is shown in Fig. 4(b)\non the plane (a, r) for the same regions indicated in Fig 4(a). Note that for\nsome regions of parameters the quantity h\u03c3t i can be much greater than the\nvalue of the mean field. For instance, about the line a = 1.9, the mean field is\nsmall, Ht \u2248 1, but h\u03c3t i \u2248 6, showing that the fluctuations can be very large\nin this system. Thus, in spite of its simplicity, the deterministic model given\nby Eqs. (1) can exhibit great spatiotemporal complexity.\n6\n\n\fr\n\n15\n14\n13\n12\n11\n10\n9\n8\n7\n6\n\n0.9\n0.8\n0.7\n0.6\n0.5\n0.4\n\n(a)\nP\nP\n\nBG\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\n1.2\n\n1.4\n\n1.6\n\n1.8\n\n2\n\na\n\n1\n\n(b)\n0,8\n\n0,6\n\nP\n\nG\n\nP\n\n0,4\n\nBG\n0,2\n\n0\n0\n\n0,2\n\n0,4\n\n0,6\n\n0,8\n\n1\n\na\n\n1,2\n\n1,4\n\n1,6\n\n1,8\n\n2\n\nFig. 5. (a) Gini coefficient at t = 104 as a function of the parameters a and r. The\nlabels BG and P indicate the regions where Boltzmann-Gibbs and Pareto behaviors\nare observed on the plane (a, r). The color code on the right indicates the values\ntaken by the Gini coefficient. (b) Gini coefficient vs. a, with fixed r = 8, where the\nlabels BG and P correspond to the regions indicated in (a).\n\nThe large dispersions observed in Fig. 4(b) reflect the inequity in the wealth\ndistribution among agents in the system. To characterize the degree of inequality in the wealth distribution we use the Gini coefficient defined at a\ntime t as [16]\nGt =\n\nN\nX\n1\n|xi \u2212 xjt |.\n2N 2 Ht i,j=1 t\n\n(4)\n\nA perfectly equitable distribution of wealth at time t, where xit = xjt , \u2200i, j,\nyields a value Gt = 0. The opposite situation, where one agent has the toP\ni\ntal wealth N\ni=1 xt , has a value of Gt = 1. Figure 5(a) shows the asymptotic\nvalue of the Gini coefficient on the plane of parameters (a, r). Note that the\nGini coefficient reaches larger values, i.e. Gt \u2208 [0.6, 0.8], in the regions associated to Pareto regimes, while it takes lower values, i.e. Gt \u2208 [0.4, 0.6], in the\nregion corresponding to Boltzmann-Gibbs behavior. This results agree with\nour qualitative understanding that equity is more favored in the presence of a\nlarger middle economic class in a society, as expressed by a Boltzmann-Gibbs\n7\n\n\fdistribution. A plot of Gt as a function of a for a fixed value r = 8 is shown in\nFig. 5(b), where the Boltzmann-Gibbs and Pareto regions are also indicated.\nIn summary, the deterministic model Eqs. (1) shows statistical behaviors described by Boltzmann-Gibbs and Pareto distributions in different regions of\nits parameters. The appearance of these collective properties does not require\nthe addition of ramdonness or any structural change in the system. Only some\nappropriate tuning of the parameters of the system is needed to obtain either type of behavior. This property contrasts with most models for economic\nbehavior in the literature which require changes in their dynamical rules in\norder to yield an exponential or a power law distribution of states. Since it\nis currently accepted that most western societies consist of two differentiated\neconomic classes characterized by different distribution functions [4], coupled\nmap models such as Eqs. (1) can be useful to study the formation of these two\neconomic populations. Our results support the view that determinism alone\ncan give rise to some relevant collective behaviors observed in economic systems. This basic model can be readily extended to include the considerations\nof more complex networks of interactions, heterogeneities, and the coevolution\nof dynamics and the topology of connectivity, among other interesting issues.\n\nAcknowledgments\nThis work was supported in part by Decanato de Investigaci\u00f3n of the Universidad Nacional Experimental del T\u00e1chira (UNET), under grants 04-001-2006\nand 04-002-2006.
