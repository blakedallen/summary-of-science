Full potential of these applications can be realized with the laser-plasma interaction\nlength increased beyond the Rayleigh diffraction length,\nzR = \u03c0\u03c302 /\u03bb0 , by means of external optical guiding [6]\n(here and later, \u03bb0 \u2248 2\u03c0c/\u03c90 is a laser wavelength, and\n\u03c30 is a laser beam waist radius). In particular, a dielectric capillary, where the oblique mirror reflections suppress the laser beam diffraction, can be used as a guiding\ntool [7, 8, 9]. Plasma can be created in a capillary by\nan optical field ionization of the filling gas [10, 11, 12],\nor by a laser ablation of the walls [13]. Then, the largeangle stimulated Raman scattering (LA SRS) starts to\nchallenge the transportation of a laser beam over a long\ndistance [14, 15].\nIn the standard SRS process [16], the pump electromagnetic wave (EMW) is scattered off spontaneous fluctuations of electron density, which, in turn, can be ampli-\n\n\u2217 Present address: Department of Physics and Institute for Fusion\nStudies, The University of Texas at Austin, One University Station\nC1500, Austin, Texas 78712; e-mail: kalmykov@physics.utexas.edu\n\nfied by the ponderomotive beat wave of pump and scattered light. Appropriate phase matching of the waves\nresults in a positive feedback loop with the onset of a\nspatio-temporal instability [17]. When the plasma extent is much larger than a laser pulse length, and no\nreflections off plasma boundaries occur, both scattering\nelectron plasma waves (EPW) and scattered EMW quit\nthe region of amplification, and the convective gain saturates within a time interval of the order of pulse duration [18, 19, 20, 21]. Given the pulse length, the\nmaximum possible gain remains the same for all scattering angles, and whether it is achieved or not for a\ngiven angle is determined by the laser pulse aspect ratio\nonly [18, 19, 20, 21]. Convection of scattered radiation\nout of the laser waist may result in a strong pulse depletion [22]. Even when the full depletion does not occur,\nthe LA SRS can produce considerable pulse erosion [23],\nsuppression of the relativistic self-focusing [24], heating\nand pre-acceleration of plasma electrons [25], and seeding\nthe forward SRS [26, 27]. Thereby, knowing the details\nof the LA SRS evolution in various physical conditions is\na matter of high importance for applications.\nConfining plasma between reflecting surfaces deeply\nmodifies the SRS process. In the one-dimensional (1D)\ngeometry, the Raman backscatter changes its nature from\nconvective to absolute [28]: reflections trap the unstable\nradiation modes inside plasma and give rise to the continuous amplification. When the laser beam is confined\nbetween the mirror-reflecting partly transparent walls,\nand propagates collinearly to them, reflections reduce\nthe sideward convection of scattered light. If the reflective modes dominate in plasma, the LA SRS gain\ntends to that of the direct backscatter and thus re-\n\n\f2\nveals a dramatic increase in comparison with the openboundary system [14]. The LA SRS in this geometry\nhas been considered so far in the regime of weak coupling [14], when the scattering EPW is similar to the\nplasma natural mode [17], and temporal growth rate is\nwell below the electron plasma frequency. This regime\nrequires\nfairly low amplitude of a laser pulse, i.e., a0 \u226a\np\n\u03c9pe /\u03c90 \u226a 1 [a0 = eE0 /(me \u03c90 c) is a normalized amplitude of the laser electric field]. However, for the efficient LWFA [4, 5, 6], the plasma density have to be reduced in order to increase the gamma-factor of the laser\nwakefield, \u03b3g = \u03c90 /\u03c9p , and, hence, the electron energy\ngain. With 1/\u03b3g < a20 < 1, the LA SRS becomes strongly\ncoupled: its temporal growth rate exceeds \u03c9pe , and the\nscattering EPW differs from the natural mode of plasma\noscillations [18, 21, 26, 29, 30]. In a plasma-filled capillary, the strongly coupled LA SRS acquires new specific features: in a wide range of parameters relevant to\nthe self-modulated LWFA [5], our PIC simulations (using the code WAKE [31]) discovered a vast enhancement\nof the near-forward SRS in the immediate vicinity of the\ncapillary entrance aperture. The unstable plasma modes\nwere primarily transverse and therefore useless for the\nlongitudinal electron acceleration. For the same range\nof parameters, this effect has never been significant in an\nopen-boundary plasma. Independent fluid modelling [32]\nverified these observations.\nMaking a step to understanding this phenomenon we\npropose a two-dimensional (2D) linear theory of strongly\ncoupled SRS of a short laser pulse under a given angle \u03b1\nin a slab of rarefied plasma laterally confined between the\nmirror-reflecting partly transparent flat walls (flat capillary). Boundary conditions for the scattered radiation\ndescribe the oblique mirror reflections and the electromagnetic (EM) seed at the entrance plane. We associate\nthe latter with the signal formed of the high-order capillary eigenmodes produced by the laser beam coupling\nto the capillary (the coupling process is described elsewhere [8, 11] and is outlined in Appendix A). SRS in\nforward (\u03b1 < \u03c0/2) and backward (\u03b1 > \u03c0/2) direction\nproceed differently. Forward Raman amplification of the\nEM seed can be dominant within a finite distance from\nthe entrance plane and be responsible for the instability\nenhancement observed in the modelling. On the other\nhand, the backward SRS is affected by the reflections\nonly. As the LA SRS of a finite-length laser pulse preserves the convective nature (backward and, partly, sideward convection of radiation is allowed), the gain saturation occurs within a finite distance from the entrance\nplane. Reflections give the unstable modes additional\nrise time in any transverse cross-section of a plasma,\nand, even for relatively small scattering angles (such as\n\u03b1 = \u03c0/6 taken for numerical examples of this paper),\nthe saturated convective gain can approach that of the\nbackward SRS (BSRS). The field structure is then approximated by a quasi-1D lossy mode whose damping is\nproduced by the leakage of radiation through the walls.\nThe paper is organized as follows. Section II presents\n\na theoretical model of the strongly coupled LA SRS in\na 2D slab geometry. The laser pulse entrance into a\nplasma and oblique mirror reflections of scattered light\nare expressed in terms of appropriate boundary-value\nconditions for the coupled-mode equations. General solution of the boundary-value problem is presented (derivation is given in Appendix B). Section III discusses the\nspatio-temporal evolution of instability. The case of fully\ntransparent lateral boundaries is considered in subsection III A. Enhancement of the LA SRS in the generic\nreflective case is considered, and the maximum gain factors are evaluated in terms of appropriate asymptotic\nsolutions in subsection III B. Section IV summarizes the\nresults.\nII.\n\nBASIC EQUATIONS AND SOLUTION OF\nBOUNDARY-VALUE PROBLEM\n\nIn a 2D plasma slab confined between mirror-reflecting\ncapillary walls, the high-frequency (hf) electric field is a\nsuperposition\n)\n(\nX\ne\u2212i\u03c90 t\na(r, t) =\na0 (r, t)eik0 z +\nas\u03c3 (r, t)ei(ks\u03c3 ,r)\n2\n\u03c3=\u00b1\n+ c.c.\n\n(1)\n\nof that of the laser, a0 , and of up- and down-going scattered EMWs, as\u00b1 \u2261 eEs\u00b1 /(me \u03c90 c) (|as\u00b1 | \u226a |a0 | < 1);\nin Eq.

Laser pulse enters the plasma at z = 0 and\nt = 0, and moves towards positive z. Boundary conditions\nare posed at the plasma boundary z = 0, the pulse leading\nfront z = ct and the walls x = 0 and x = Lx .

The boundary-value\nproblem is solved in the area c(t \u2212 t0 ) < z < ct, 0 < x < Lx .\n\nin Appendix A). The resonant condition for the wave\nvectors selects the modes that can be amplified by the\nforward SRS (\u03b1 < \u03c0/2) thus leading to the formation of\nan EM seed signal. To facilitate the forthcoming analytic\njob, we give this signal in a simple parabolic form with an\namplitude vanishing at the walls in order to provide the\ncontinuity of the solution in the interior of the capillary,\n\u0003\n\u0002\n(6)\nas\u00b1 (x, z = \u22120, \u03be) = as0 1 \u2212 (1 \u2212 2x/Lx )2 .\nInside the capillary, oblique mirror reflections couple upand down-going EMW: each reflection converts an upgoing wave into a down-going one and vice versa,\nas+ (0, z, \u03be) = r(\u03b1) as\u2212 (0, z, \u03be),\nas\u2212 (Lx , z, \u03be) = r(\u03b1) as+ (Lx , z, \u03be).\n\n(7a)\n(7b)\n\nThe conditions (7) set up a quasi-1D exponential behavior of waves at large z.

Figure 3 shows r(\u03b1) for a glass capillary with\n\u03b4w \u2248 1.5 and \u03b4pl \u2248 1.\nThe temporal increment of strongly coupled LA SRS\nexceeds the electron plasma frequency. Hence, we neglect kp2 N\u00b1 in comparison with \u2202 2 N\u00b1 /\u2202\u03be 2 in the lefthand side (LHS) of Eq. (3b).

Our solution possesses the same generic structure as the weakly coupled\nreflective solution discussed in detail in Ref. 14. However,\ncontrary to the case of semi-infinite laser pulse of Ref. 14,\nthe growth time of unstable waves is now limited by the\npulse duration t0 , and, as shown in the subsection III B,\nthe gain at a given point (x, z) remains finite and is given\nby either Eq. (15) or (16).\n\nIII.\n\nA.\n\nSPATIO-TEMPORAL EVOLUTION OF\nUNSTABLE WAVES\nEvolution of instability in open-boundary\nsystem\n\nWhen the lateral boundaries are fully transparent, r =\n0, the EM seed at the entrance plane vanishes (as0 = 0),\nand the instability grows from the electron density noise\nin a fresh plasma ahead of the pulse. The functions (9)\n\nthen read\n\u03a61D (R; r, cj ) = Fs (cj , z/Vz , \u03be)H(Vz x \u2212 Vx z),\n\u03a62D (R; r, cj ) = Fs (cj , x/Vx , \u03be)H(Vx z \u2212 Vz x).\nPlasma is divided by the characteristics \u03be = z/Vz , x =\nz(Vx /Vz ), \u03be = x/Vx , into ranges of dependence, where\nthe solution is prescribed by the boundary conditions for\nradiation posed at the pulse leading edge \u03be = 0 (range I),\n\u03be < x/Vx\n\u03be < z/Vz\n\n\u001b\n\n=\u21d2 \u03a61D \u2261 0, \u03a62D \u2261 0\n\nat the wall x = 0 (range II),\n\u001b\nx < z(Vx /Vz )\n=\u21d2 \u03a61D \u2261 0, \u03a62D 6\u2261 0\n\u03be > x/Vx\nor at the entrance plane z = \u22120 (range III),\n\u001b\nx > z(Vx /Vz )\n=\u21d2 \u03a61D 6\u2261 0, \u03a62D \u2261 0.\n\u03be >\nz/Vz\n\n(10)\n\n(11)\n\n(12)\n\nThe principal feature that makes the LA SRS of a short\npulse [21] different from the case of semi-infinite laser\nbeam [19] is the gain saturation within a finite distance\nfrom the entrance plane. At some point, zsat < +\u221e, the\nscattered radiation arriving from the plasma boundary\n\n\f5\n\nCoefficient of reflection, r(\u03b1)\n\n1\n\n0.8\n\n0.6\n\n0.4\n\n0.2\n\n0\n0\n\n30\n\n60\n\n90\n\n120\n\nScattering angle \u03b1, deg.\n\n150\n\n180\n\nFIG. 3: Coefficient of reflection versus scattering angle for a\nglass wall with an index of refraction \u03b4w = 1.5 (the refraction\nindex of plasma is taken equal to unity).\n\nz = \u22120 drops behind the laser pulse, and in all the points\nz > zsat neither part of the pulse belongs to the range III.\nThen, the evolution of waves and the gain do not alter\nwith z. The gain saturates differently for the forward\n(\u03b1 < \u03c0/2) and backward (\u03b1 > \u03c0/2) scattering.\nWhen \u03b1 < \u03c0/2, and the distance from the entrance\nplane is not too large, i.e., z < min {Vz ct0 , Lx (Vz /Vx )},\nall the three areas (10)-(12) are available in the pulse\nbody (that is, within a rectangle 0 \u2264 \u03be \u2264 ct0 , 0 \u2264 x \u2264\nLx ). Given the point (x, z), waves fall initially within a\nrange I, where they grow in time exponentially with an\nangle-independent increment\nq\n\u221a\n\u221a\n2 .\n\u03b30 = ( 3c/2)G \u2248 ( 3/2) 3 (a0 /2)2 \u03c90 \u03c9pe\n(13)\nNote, that \u03ba = \u03b30 /c is the known \"spatial\" increment of the strongly coupled BSRS in the co-moving\nframe [6, 18, 20, 21, 26, 30]. The evolution of waves\nis strictly 1D in space on this stage. Later, information from the boundaries x = 0 and z = \u22120 reaches the\npoint (x, z), and the spatial dependence becomes either\n2D for \u03be > x/Vx , x < z(Vx /Vz ) (range II) or remains\n1D for \u03be > z/Vz , x > z(Vx /Vz ) (range III). The waves\nare not exponentially growing at this time. In the range\nIII, the entrance effect dominates: vanishing the scattered EMW at the boundary z = \u22120 determines the\nbehavior of 1D amplitudes. Deeply enough in plasma,\nz \u2265 min {Vz ct0 , Lx (Vz /Vx )}, the entrance effect vanishes\nas the pulse terminates sooner than the scattered EMW\nfrom the entrance plane can reach the observer at a given\nz. The pulse body is then divided between the ranges I\nand II, and the evolution of LA SRS is the same through\nthe rest of the plasma.\nFor \u03b1 > \u03c0/2, the boundary-value condition posed for\nradiation at z = \u22120 can only produce the scattered EMW\nconvecting outwards (the EMW characteristic \u03be = z/Vz\nrecasts in the lab frame variables as z = \u2212ct| cos \u03b1|, and\ncorresponds to the wave propagating towards negative z).\nThus, the entrance effect does not change the solution\nat a positive z, and the boundary-value condition (6)\n\nbecomes excessive (this is also valid in the reflective case).\nThe spatio-temporal evolution of the LA SRS remains the\nsame at any z \u2265 0.\nGiven the pulse duration, the maximum of the saturated gain, as+ , N+ \u223c e\u03b30 t0 , does not depend on the\nscattering angle, and whether it is achieved or not is determined solely by the pulse aspect ratio [21]. If the pulse\nis wide, or the scattering angle is sufficiently large, \u03b1 >\n\u03b10 = 2 arctan (ct0 /Lx ), the maximum gain is achieved at\nthe pulse rear edge \u03be = ct0 for ct0 cot(\u03b1/2) < x < Lx .\nHence, the angular spectrum of scattered light is prescribed by the pulse aspect ratio rather than the angular\ndependence of the increment. For Lx \u226b ct0 , scattering\nwithin a broad range of angles 2ct0 /Lx < \u03b1 \u2264 \u03c0 proceeds\nwith the maximum gain. Otherwise, for Lx \u226a ct0 , the\nhighest gain corresponds to the near-backward scattering\nonly, \u03c0 \u2212 Lx /(ct0 ) < \u03b1 \u2264 \u03c0 (Ref. 21). To estimate the\npulse energy depletion due to the LA SRS, it is sufficient\nto neglect the radiation scattered under angles smaller\nthan \u03b10 (Ref. 36).\nB.\n\nLA SRS evolution in the reflective case\n\nIn a capillary, the oblique mirror reflections of scattered light off the walls [the boundary condition (7)] contribute to the LA SRS evolution over the whole laser\npath in plasma, but become actually dominating later,\nwhen the entrance effect vanishes (z > Vz ct0 ). The reflections establish a long-distance asymptotic state of the\nLA SRS - amplification of a quasi-1D radiation and\nplasma modes with a temporal increment close to that\nof the direct backscatter (13). Besides, the forward SRS\nis seeded by the EM signal as+ (x, \u22120, \u03be) at the capillary entrance plane [the boundary condition (6)]. If the\nsignal amplitude as0 exceeds the amplitude of the electron density noise N0 , the unstable waves will achieve a\nlarge amplitude (by virtue of the high seed level) at the\ntransient stage of laser propagation, 0 < z < Vz ct0 . In\nthis case, contrary to the SRS in the unbounded plasmas\ndescribed in the preceding subsection, the near-forward\nSRS exhibits much higher level of amplification than the\nbackward SRS (\u03b1 > \u03c0/2), and its contribution to the\ndynamics of electron density perturbations can be dominating. Nonlinearities of plasma response that can then\nappear are worth investigating and will be addressed in\nfuture publications.\n\u223c\nThe\nasymptotic\n0 F\u03032 (; b1 , b2 ; \u03b8)\n\u221a \u22121 (1\u2212b \u2212b )/3 3 \u221a\n3\n\u03b8\n\u22121/3\n1\n2\n(2\u03c0 3) \u03b8\ne\n+ O(\u03b8\n) at |\u03b8| \u2192 \u221e\n(Ref. 35) helps to evaluate the level of the EM seed\namplification within the interval 0 < z < Vz ct0 ,\n\u221a\n\n1/3\n\nF e3 3\u03b6\n|as+ (z < Vz ct0 )| \u223c as0 \u221a\n\u03b6 1/6\n2 3\u03c0\n\n/2\n\n,\n\n(14)\n\nwhere \u03b6 \u226b 1. Then, |N+ | \u223c (Vz /g1 )(\u03b6 1/3 /z)|as+ |.

Equation (16) is valid under the \"low leakage\" condition,\nr > exp(\u22123GLx /Vx ), which indicates that the scattered\nlight is mostly trapped inside a plasma slab: the energy\nleakage through the wall at one reflection (that produces\nan effective decrement \u2206\u03b3 \u226a \u03b30 ) is less than the energy\ngain on the way between the walls. The lateral growth of\nthe asymptote (16) is much slower than the growth with\n\u03be. Asymptotic solution (16) displays the basic result of\nthe reflective theory of the LA SRS: at large distances\nfrom the entrance plane and large coefficients of amplification, the amplitudes of unstable waves tend to quasi1D leaky modes exponentially growing in time with the\nincrement tending to that of the BSRS (13).\nComparison of Eqs. (15) and (16) shows that the maximum amplitude of the scattering EPW on the transient stage, z < Vz ct0 , differs from the final asymptotic level of density perturbations roughly by a factor of (G/g1 )(\u03b30 t0 )\u22121/2 (as0 /N0 ). When this factor is\nlarger than unity, and |N+ (z \u2265 Vz ct0 , x, ct0 )| \u223c 1, the\nplasma response can become nonlinear in the vicinity of\nz = Vz ct0 /3. This could be avoided by keeping the ratio of the seed amplitudes as0 /N0 below (g1 /G)(\u03b30 t0 )1/2 .\nThe amplitude of the electron density noise is difficult to\ncontrol in experiment; however, as shown in Appendix A,\nthe content of the high-order eigenmodes in the laser radiation coupled to the capillary (and, hence, the amplitude\nas0 of the EM seed signal), can be effectively reduced by\n\n(b)\n7.3\n6\n\nlog10| N+/N0 |\n\nlog10| N+/N0 |\n\n4\n2\n\n0\n12\n\n9\n\n6\n\nkpx\n\n3\n\n0\n\n0\n\n2\n\n6\n\n4\n\n4\n2\n\n6\n\nkpx\n\n9\n\n6\n\nkpx\n\n3\n\n0\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\nkp(ct\u2212z)\n\n0\n\n5.4 (d)\n5\n\n7.3\n6\n\n9\n\n2\n\nkp(ct\u2212z)\n\n(c)\n\n0\n12\n\n4\n\n0\n12\n\nlog10 | N+/N0 |\n\nand |as+ (\u03be0 , zmax )| \u223c (g1 /G)|N+ (\u03be0 , zmax )|.\nEquation (15) shows that the maximum gain on the transient stage is determined by the 1D temporal increment (13) independent on \u03b1 (the angular dependence is\nretained in the pre-exponential factors only).p For the\nminimally allowed scattering angle, \u03b1min = 2\u03c9pe /\u03c90\n(hence, Vz \u2248 \u03c90 /\u03c9pe ), the point of the maximal gain is\nzmax (\u03b1min ) \u2248 (\u03c90 /\u03c9pe )(ct0 /3) \u226b ct0 . Parameters of the\nfollowing numerical example (Fig. 4) give zmax (\u03b1min ) \u2248\n3 mm, which is shorter than a typical capillary length\nused in experiments (\u2265 1 cm) [8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 15].\nFor z > zmax , the entrance effect becomes less pronounced and finally vanishes at the point z = Vz ct0 =\n3zmax , where the EM signal arriving from z = \u22120 drops\nbehind the laser pulse, and the instability growth saturates. Evolution of both forward and backward scattering is then determined by the lateral reflections only\nand, given the scattering angle, remains the same in any\nx\u2212y cross-section for z \u2265 Vz ct0 . We show in Appendix C\nthat at z \u2265 Vz ct0 , and \u03b30 t0 > 1, a cumbersome exact solution (8a) tends asymptotically to a quasi-1D damped\nmode with a temporal growth rate close to (13) that gives\nthe asymptote for the density perturbation amplitude,\n\n(a)\n7.3\n6\n\nlog10| N+/N0 |\n\nzmax = Vz ct0 /3.

The dashed lines are the characteristics of reflected\nwaves, x + nLx = z(Vx /Vz ), \u03be = z/Vz , and \u03be = (x + nLx )/Vx .\nOne reflection contributes to the scattering process in the\nrange II in the case (a), and two reflections - in the case (b).\nRaman amplification of the EM signal given at the boundary\nz = \u22120 contributes to the solution in the sub-range IIb and\nrange III.\n\nthe same in any plasma cross-section x \u2212 y beyond that\npoint. Figure 4(b) shows this solution. The ranges of\ninfluence of boundary conditions are shown in Fig. 5. In\nthe range I [see Eq. (10)], the electron density noise from\n\u03be = 0 is amplified, and the waves do not experience reflections. In the range IIa the instability is seeded by the\nfree-plasma noise, and yet is enhanced by the reflections;\nthe Raman amplified signal arriving from the entrance\nplane is added to these waves in the range IIb. The EM\nseed from the entrance plane z = \u22120 is amplified by the\nforward SRS in the range III.\nIn a capillary, the forward SRS is considerably enhanced at z < Vz ct0 (roughly by a factor of 70 in\namplitude) versus the case of unbound plasma [compare Figs. 4(a) and (b)]. Despite the EM seed amplified in the range IIb is non-exponentially growing,\nthe high ratio of seed amplitudes, as0 /N0 \u2248 2.7 \u226b\n(g1 /G)(\u03b30 t0 )1/2 \u2248 0.026, makes the entrance effect rather\npronounced [plot 4(a)]. For N0 \u2248 1.5 \u00d7 10\u22126 , and F \u223c 1,\nEq. (15) gives log10 |N+ (\u03be0 , zmax )/N0 | \u2248 7.15, which\nagrees with Fig. 4(a). Hence, parameters of the numerical example lay at the border of validity of the linear\napproach, and increase in as0 will result in the nonlinearity of the plasma response on the transient stage {e.g.,\nperfect matching gives a0s \u2248 0.012a0, hence, according\nto Eq. (15), |N+ (\u03be0 , zmax )| \u223c 106 ; this burst of the forward SRS has been the regular feature in our numerical\nexperiments and in the fluid simulations [32]}. On the\n\nPlot 4(c) shows a quasi-1D saturated solution [compare\nwith Fig. 4(b)] thus shaped by the contribution from two\nreflections [according to Fig. 5(b)], which, in full agreement with the long-scale asymptote (16), demonstrates\nthe growth rate close to that of BSRS. Difference between\nFigs. 4(a) and (c) shows that, under the parameters of\nour example, the forward scattering (\u03b1 < \u03c0/2) is characterized at z < Vz ct0 by much higher gain than the SRS\nin the backward direction (\u03b1 > \u03c0/2). This situation is\ncompletely reverse of the SRS in an unbounded plasma,\nwhere the gain can only fall as an angle drops [18]. So,\nthe higher the EM seed level produced by the laser beam\ncoupling (that is, the tighter the capillary in a numerical\nor real-scale experiment), the more important becomes\nthe forward SRS. In such case, a high amplification level\nof waves may be observed within quite a long distance\nin plasma, z < Vz (\u03b1min )ct0 \u2248 (\u03c90 /\u03c9pe )ct0 [see also the\ndiscussion following Eq. (15)]. This effect is adverse for\nsuch applications as the self-modulated LWFA in capillaries [15]. The way of reducing the excessive forward\nSRS enhancement can be found in using a wider capillary (the laser focal spot fixed) than the perfect matching\nrequires.\nFigure 4(d) traces the temporal evolution of the upgoing EPW at x = Lx /4 (near the capillary wall).\nThe asymptote (16) perfectly approximates (and, for\napplications, can be used instead of) the exact reflective solution (8b). The dash-dotted and dotted lines in\nFig. 4(d) correspond to the BSRS solution |N+ (\u03be)| \u2248\n(N0 /3) exp (\u03b30 \u03be/c) and the exact non-reflective solution,\nrespectively, providing the upper and lower limits of the\nconvective gain variation. In this example, only in the\nvicinity of the border x = 0 the coefficients of amplification in the reflective and non-reflective cases are considerably different [compare Figs. 4(b) and (c)]. Contribution from the reflections increases the wave amplitude\nat x = Lx /4 by roughly an order of magnitude (compare\nsolid and dotted lines at kp \u03be \u2248 6). For the parameters\nchosen, the scattering EPW remains linear in the convective saturated regime (z > Vz ct0 ): the plasma noise\nlevel, N0 \u2248 1.5 \u00d7 10\u22126 , substituted into Eq. (16), gives\n|N+ | \u2264 0.2 throughout the whole time interval 0 < t < t0 .\nIn the limit r \u2192 1 the total suppression of the lateral convection occurs. The up- and down-going amplitudes (8) become purely one-dimensional for z > Vz ct0\nand completely identical. These amplitudes grow in time\nexponentially with the BSRS increment (13).\n\n\f8\nCONCLUSION\n\nWe have proposed a 2D non-stationary linear theory\nof strongly coupled LA SRS of a short laser pulse in a\nflat plasma slab confined between mirror-reflecting walls\n(flat capillary). In a capillary, the lateral convection of\nscattered light is partly suppressed by the oblique reflections, and the instability experiences an enhancement.\nAdditional enhancement of the SRS in forward direction\n(\u03b1 > \u03c0/2) is produced by the amplification of the electromagnetic seed signal that is formed of the high-order\ncapillary eigenmodes at the entrance plane (formation of\nthe signal is a consequence of the laser beam coupling to\nthe capillary). The convective nature of LA SRS does not\nchange. The asymptotic behavior of the waves demonstrates the transition from the set of 2D modes to the\ndominant quasi-1D damped mode. Even for near-forward\nscattering the convective gain of the dominant quasi-1D\nmode may be close to the BSRS gain.\n\n0\n10\n\u22121\n10\n\n\u03c30=0.645r0\n\n\u22122\n10\n\n\u03c30=0.43r0\n\n\u22123\n10\n\nCn\n\nIV.\n\n\u22124\n10\n\n\u03c30=0.3225r0\n\n\u22125\n10\n\u22126\n10\n\n\u03c30=0.258r0\n\n\u22127\n10\n\u22128\n10\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\nn\n\nFIG. 6: Overlap integral between the radial profiles of amplitude of the incident laser (Gaussian) and of the capillary\nhybrid eigenmodes EH1n .\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThis work was started with the aid of a postdoctoral\nfellowship from the Centre de Physique Th\u00e9orique, Ecole\nPolytechnique, and its completion was supported by\nthe Fortbildungsstipendium from Max-Planck-Institut\nf\u00fcr Quantenoptik.

A rootmean-square (rms) amplitude of these fluctuations is represented in the equations by the quantity N0 , which\ngives the amount of seed corresponding to the element\nof solid angle d\u03a9ke in the direction of the wave vector ke of scattering\nEPW, and can be expressed as\nR\n2\n3D\n2\nN02 (ke ) = d\u03a9ke n3D\ne k dk \u2248 ne (ke )ke \u2206ke d\u03a9ke , where\nn3D\n(k\n)\nis\na\nspectral\ndensity\nof\nelectron\nfluctuations ine\ne\ntegrated over frequencies [37]. The integral is taken\nover the area of maximal spectral density of scattering\nEPW\np [k \u2248 ke , the amplification bandwidth c\u2206ke \u2248\n4 \u03b30 /t0 is estimated at \u03b30 t0 \u226b 1 with taking account\nof the gain narrowing (Ref. 36)]. Using the ratio of\nthe phase volumes |dke /dks | = 2 sin2 (\u03b1/2) (Ref. 38),\nwe express the seed amplitude through the element of\nsolid angle d\u03a9ks in the direction of detector, N02 \u2248\n2\n1/2\n8n3D\nsin2 (\u03b1/2)d\u03a9ks . Our theorete (ke )k0 [(\u03b30 /c)/(ct0 )]\nical formalism based on the assumption of quasi-plane interacting waves requires small variation of the scattered\nwave amplitude across the direction ks in the transversely\nlimited area, 0 \u2264 x \u2264 Lx , which gives an estimate of\nthe angular spread \u2206\u03b1 \u2248 cos \u03b1/(Lx k0 ). The element\n\nof solid angle then estimated as \u2206\u03a9ks \u2248 2\u03c0 sin \u03b1\u2206\u03b1 =\n\u03c0 sin 2\u03b1/(Lx k0 ) gives\ns\n8\u03c0 1+(ke rDe )2 (\u03b30 t0 )1/2 sin2 (\u03b1/2) sin 2\u03b1\n,\n|N0 | \u2248\nn0 \u03bb30 2+(ke rDe )2 (\u03c90 t0 )3/2\nk0 Lx\n(A1)\nwhere the spectral density of low-frequency electron fluctuations n3D\ne (ke ) is evaluated using formula (11.2.6.6)\nof Ref. 37. Parameters of Fig. 4 and ke rD e \u226a 1 give\n|N0 | \u2248 1.5 \u00d7 10\u22126 .\nFor the strongly coupled SRS in the forward direction\n(\u03b1 < \u03c0/2), coupling the laser beam to a capillary creates\nadditional source of instability. The radial profile of an\nincident radiation with the wings cut off by the edges of\nthe entrance aperture is approximated with an expansion\nthrough an infinite number of radial eigenmodes (having\nthe same frequency \u03c90 ) [7, 8]. The high-order eigenmodes\n(characterized by the frequency \u03c9s = \u03c90 and high transverse wavenumbers, kn\u22a5 \u223c ksx , where the integer n is\nthe mode order) form the seed signal that is further amplified in plasma by the SRS [in the model form, the\ntransverse profile of this signal is given by Eq. (6)]. It\nshould be emphasized that these modes provide no seed\nfor the weakly coupled SRS (including near-forward SRS\nand RMI\np [34] that correspond to small scattering angles,\n\u03b1 \u226a \u03c9pe /\u03c90 ), as this process requires the frequency\nmatching \u03c9s \u2248 \u03c90 \u2212 \u03c9pe between the seed and the pump.\nExact functional form of the capillary eigenmodes depends on the geometry chosen. Despite the LA SRS in\na flat capillary is considered in the paper, we suppose\nthat an estimate of the EM seed level will be more useful for applications if inferred from the axi-symmetric\ntheory of the laser beam propagation in a dielectric\ntube [7, 8]. The theory represents an electric field profile at the entrance aperture of the radius r0 as an in-\n\n\f9\nP+\u221e\nfinite sum \u00e3(r) = a0R n=1 Cn J0 (kn\u22a5 r) (Ref. 11), where\nr\nCn = 2[r0 J1 (un )]\u22122 0 0 a(r)J0 (un r/r0 )r dr is the overlap\nintegral of the hybrid capillary eigenmode EH1n with the\nincident laser profile a(r) = exp(\u2212r2 /\u03c302 ) (Fig. 6). Here,\nun is the nth zero of the zero-order Bessel function of\nthe first kind, J0 (un ) = 0; for k0 r0 \u226b 1, and n \u226b 1,\nkn\u22a5 r0 \u2248 un \u2248 (n + 1/2)\u03c0. Fig. 6 shows that about 98%\nof laser energy is coupled to the fundamental mode for\n\u03c30 = 0.645r0 (the perfect matching condition); however,\nthe overlap integral decays very slowly as n grows {the\nanalytic fit, Cn \u223c Fn = exp[\u2212(n + 50)0.3 ], is almost exact for n > 10}. When the ratio \u03c30 /r0 drops, the larger\nnumber of lower-order eigenmodes is effectively excited\n(up to 5 for \u03c30 = 0.258r0 ), but contribution from the\nhigher-order modes into the radiation profile at z = \u22120\ndrops sharply (e.g., analytic fit Cn \u2248 3\u00d710\u22126 Fn , n > 10,\nholds for \u03c30 = 0.258r0 ). Therefore, choosing wider capillary is the way of reducing the effect of laser coupling on\nthe forward strongly coupled SRS.\nThe numerical example of subsection III B shows how\nthe SRS under the angle \u03b1 = \u03c0/6 develops in the capillary with an EM seed amplitude characteristic of the\naxi-symmetric capillary tube by a factor of two wider\nthan in the case of perfect matching. For the parameters\nof Fig. 4, with the value Lx /2 \u2248 860k0\u22121 assigned to r0 ,\nequalizing the effective radial wave number kn\u22a5 \u2248 n\u03c0/r0\nto the resonant wave number ks\u22a5 = k0 sin \u03b1 gives the\nresonant mode order n\u2217 \u2248 (k0 r0 /\u03c0) sin \u03b1 \u2248 136 corresponding to C136 \u2248 0.58 \u00d7 10\u22125 under the condition \u03c30 = 0.3225r0 (analytic fit Cn \u2248 0.7 \u00d7 10\u22123 Fn\nwas used; see also Fig. 6). One can expect that sev-\n\neral modes with n \u2248 n\u2217 can contribute to the effective amplitude as0 of the seed signal. The difference\nin the mode numbers \u2206n = n\u2217 \u2212 n causes the angular\nspread \u2206\u03b1 around the given scattering angle; this spread\nshould not exceed the admissible value established above,\n\u2206\u03b1 < cos \u03b1/(Lx k0 ) \u2248 cos \u03b1/(2r0 k0 ). For |\u2206\u03b1| \u226a \u03b1\nand |\u2206n| \u226a n\u2217 , one has \u2206n \u2248 (k0 r0 /\u03c0) cos \u03b1\u2206\u03b1 <\ncos2 \u03b1/(2\u03c0) < 1, so that only one capillary mode with\nn = n\u2217 can contribute to the scattering under the given\nangle. Therefore, the seed amplitude used for the numerical demonstration of Fig. 4(a) is evaluated as as0 \u2248\nC136 a0 \u2248 0.4 \u00d7 10\u22125 .\nAPPENDIX B: DERIVATION OF THE EXACT\nREFLECTIVE SOLUTION\n\nOmitted kp2 in the LHS of Eq.

Neither s = cj (where \u0393s = 0) nor\ns = 0 are the singularities of the image \u0101s+ (x, z \u2192 \u221e, s),\nso contributions to the asymptotic originate from the singular points sn only, which are the solutions of the equation \u0393sn = \u03bdn [here, \u03bdn = (Vx /Vz )(\u2212 ln r + 2\u03c0in)/Lx ], or\ns3n + \u03bdn Vz s2n \u2212 iG3 = 0, n is integer. The fundamental\nspecific point s0 with the maximum real part is the root\nof the cubic equation s3 + \u03bd0 Vz s2 \u2212 iG3 = 0 which, for\narbitrary \u03bd0 , admits quite a cumbersome explicit expression. We address to the physically interesting limit of\n\"low leakage\", i.e., \u03bd0 < 3G/Vz , or r > exp(\u22123GLx /Vx ),\nwhich means that the scattered EMW gains more energy\nbetween two reflections than loses due to leakage through\nthe wall at one reflection. In this case the lateral convection is mostly suppressed. Solution\u221aobtained via the\nperturbation approach reads s0 \u2248 (i + 3)G/2 \u2212 \u03bd0 Vz /3.\nContribution to the asymptotic from that point is of the\norder of es0 \u03be , which grows in time with an increment\nRe s0 . However, the absolute value of \u03bdn grows with n,\nso an evaluation has to be done of the contribution from\nthe points sn with large n. We again use the perturbation approach with the small parameter \u03bcn = G/(|\u03bd\u0303n |Vz ),\n(1)\nthat is, n > GLx /(2\u03c0Vx ), and find the solutions sn \u2248\np\n(2,3)\n\u2248 \u00b1G \u2212(sign n)\u03bcn . Obviously,\n\u2212\u03bdn Vz \u2212 iG\u03bc2n , sn\nResj \u226a G for \u03bcn \u226a 1, so that contribution from these\npoints to the asymptotic is negligible compared to that\nfrom the points sn with n < GLx /(2\u03c0Vx ), which is of the\norder of es0 \u03be . Expanding the image \u0101s+ (x, z \u2192 \u221e, s) in\nthe vicinity of s = s0 , we arrive at the expression asymptotically valid for G\u03be \u226b 1,\nas+ (x, \u03be) \u223c\n\nVz\nG\n\n\u0012\n\n1\u2212r\nln r\n\n\u0013\n\n\u221a\n\u0013\n\u0012\ni\u2212 3\nx\n,\nexp s0 \u03be \u2212 ln r\n6\nLx\n\nwhich represents the unstable EMW as a quasi-1D exponentially growing mode.\n\nPogosova, and R.
