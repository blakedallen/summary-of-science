This behavior holds\neven relatively far away from the classical limit. The complex resonance wave functions are found\nto be localized on the fractal classical repeller.\nPACS numbers: 05.45.Mt, 03.65.Sq\n\nThe classical and quantum dynamics of open Hamiltonian systems is relevant to a variety of topics of current interest in macroscopic and microscopic physics.\nFor example, in planetary physics, the formation of binaries in the Kuiper-belt may have proceeded through\nthe formation of transitory objects in chaotic layers of\nphase space trapped close to above-barrier KolmogorovArnold-Moser (KAM) islands [1, 2, 3]. The analogs of\nthese states in open quantum Hamiltonians are resonances (quasibound states) which, in general, are predicted to be localized on an object known as the classical\nrepeller [4]. The repeller is the intersection of two fractal\nsets of classical trajectories one of which remains trapped\nin the infinite past and the other in the infinite future,\ndenoted as K\u2212 and K+ , respectively. The fractal nature of these sets has led to the prediction of a fractal\nWeyl law for flows in which the number of long-living\nquantum resonances scales as ~\u2212(1+dH ) where dH is the\npartial Hausdorff dimension of the repeller [5].\nIn open maps the number of resonances has already\nbeen found to obey a similar fractal Weyl law, ~\u2212d , except that d is now the partial fractal dimension of the\ntrapped set. This relates to the original Weyl law [6] conceived for closed systems which states that the number\nof eigenstates up to energy E which fits into the available phase-space volume of the classical system scales as\n~\u2212d , with d being the actual (integer) dimensionality of\nquantum space. In addition, in open maps the associated quantum Husimi distributions are observed to cling\nto the classical repeller [7, 8]. Although the fractal Weyl\nlaw has been observed in particular maps like the baker\nmap and the kicked rotor [5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12], there\nhave been few previous studies of this problem in open\nHamiltonian systems [13] even though such systems are\nof direct physical interest; e.g., the chaotic ionization of\nhydrogen atom interacting with a circularly polarized microwave exhibits above-barrier chaotic trapping [14].\nHere we present an examination of above-barrier quantum resonance (Gamow) states in a model Hamiltonian whose classical dynamics is chaotic. The system\n\nis described by a smooth potential and numerous abovebarrier resonances are supported. The model we use is\nchosen to capture essential features of the chaotic ionization dynamics of atoms in rotating fields; further, we\npropose, that this mechanism may also be important in\ncomplex formation in certain chemical reactions. We find\nthat, not only does the fractal Weyl law hold for a typical\n(generic) open Hamiltonian system [15], but it also holds\neven in the vicinity of ~ = 1, i.e., far from the classical\nlimit.\nThe investigation of a fractal law for open analytical\nHamiltonian systems is problematic for a number of technical reasons, including the larger dimensionality of phase\nspace N needed to observe the chaotic repeller; unlike\nin unidimensional maps, for which N = 2, in an autonomous Hamiltonian the repeller exists only if N \u2265 4\nwhich compounds the computational challenges involved.\nAn additional computational difficulty is the calculation\nof resonance eigenfunctions in the limit ~ \u2192 0 because of\nthe attendant growth in the size of the basis needed to\nconverge the calculations. Some of these obstacles have\nbeen overcome in a previous study which reported fractal Weyl law behavior in an open Hamiltonian whose potential energy surface (PES) consisted of three gaussian\nbumps [13]. However, for computational reasons only a\nrather limited number of resonances were included in the\nanalysis and the structure of the resonance eigenstates\nthemselves was not examined.\nThe model chosen here provides a realistic model of the\nchaotic ionization of atoms and of resonances in chemical reactions in that the PES features a potential well\ntogether with saddle points and, depending on the energy, the classical dynamics may be mixed (i.e., regular\nand chaotic) even above the saddle points. Computation\nof quantum complex (resonance) eigenvalues and quantum surfaces of section (QSOS, see, e.g., Ref. [12, 16]),\nbased on Husimi distributions, reveals that the abovebarrier resonance energies are localized on the classical\nrepeller. For values of ~ away from the asymptotic limit\nthere is progressively more delocalization.

The\nbounding curve, solid line (red online), of the SOS is also\nshown. Both axes have been scaled to the interval (0,1) to\nallow for comparison with the Husimi plot of Fig. 3.\n\ntage of the model used is that the calculations are more\ntractable than for, say, the H atom interacting with rotating fields for which the Coulomb term complicates the\ncomputations.\nThe model is a modification of the H\u00e9non-Heiles (HH)\nHamiltonian [17]\n1\n1 2 2 1 2 2\n(p +p )+ (x +y )+\u03bb(x2 y\u2212 y 3 )\u2212\u03c9 (xpy \u2212ypx )\n2 x y 2\n3\n(1)\nwhere, throughout, \u03bb = 0.1 and \u03c9 = 0.1. The modification is the presence of a Coriolis term - the term in \u03c9 which is designed to simulate the addition of, e.g., a CPM\nfield or a magnetic field to a Rydberg atom [18]. Because\nthe Hamiltonian does not have rotational symmetry this\nangular-momentum-like term is not a conserved quantity.\nFurthermore, the presence of the Coriolis term means\nthat it is no longer possible to define a potential energy\nsurface - instead one can resort to using the device of a\nzero velocity surface (or ZVS, see, e.g., Ref. [14]). Finally,\ntime reversal symmetry of the system is broken. Energies\nand widths are scaled by the energy of the three saddle\npoints in the ZVS, i.e., Es = (1 \u2212 \u03c9 2 )3 /6\u03bb2 = 16.17165.\nThe structure of the repeller is shown in Fig. 1 for\n\u03c9 = 0.1 and an energy rather high above the saddle\npoint energy. The repeller was computed by integrating trajectories forwards and backwards in time. The\ninitial conditions of trajectories which survived (i.e., did\nnot escape) for a time \u03c40 were saved. Survivors were\nthen reintegrated for a time 20\u03c40 and their intersections\nwith an appropriate Poincar\u00e9 surface of section (SOS)\nwere recorded. In this case the SOS chosen is defined by\nx = 0, \u1e8b < 0.\nThe effect of adding the Coriolis term is that, for\nnonzero \u03c9, relatively large KAM islands may co-exist\nwith - but are not part of - the repeller for energies considerably above the energy of the saddle points. Here\nH=\n\nwe do not consider resonances directly associated with\nthese islands. However, the Coriolis terms has the effect\nof bringing out the structure of the repeller more clearly\nthan for the pure HH system (\u03c9 = 0 [17]). Thus, varying\n\u03c9 allows for the fine tuning of the dynamics in the energy\nregime of interest.\nThe method of complex rotation was used to compute\nthe complex resonance energies En = Er \u2212 i\u0393n /2 where\n\u0393n is the resonance width [19]. This was accomplished\nby rotating the coordinates into the complex plane by an\nangle \u03b8, i.e., qi \u2192 qi ei\u03b8 and then diagonalizing the resulting Hamiltonian matrix in a two-dimensional isotropic\noscillator basis |n, mi [17]. In principle the procedure is\nstraightforward although care must be exercised to ensure that resonances are distinguished from scattering\nstates. This can be accomplished by examining so-called\n\u03b8-trajectories, i.e., as the angle \u03b8 is varied the resonances,\nas distinct from scattering states, converge. A large number of resonances lying above the saddle points are required to achieve the quality of statistics needed to determine how the number of resonances scales with ~.\nThe complex energy spectrum for the Hamiltonian of\neq. 1 contains resonances lying below as well as above\nthe saddle points. Sub-saddle states decay by tunneling. However, the states of interest lie above the saddle\npoints and, therefore, a large basis set must be used to\nconverge these resonances. As ~ is decreased the number\nof states below the saddles grows and, therefore, the size\nof the basis must be increased. For this reason it is difficult to access the very small values of ~ - or equivalently,\nthe very high-lying states - for which it is normally assumed that the fractal Weyl law will hold. Working on\nthe observation that, in general, asymptotic expansions\noften provide good agreement even outside their strict\ndomains of validity, we examined resonance statistics for\n~ in the vicinity of ~ = 1. Numerically, resonances were\ncomputed by direct diagonalization and also, as check,\nby using the Arnoldi method which takes advantage of\nthe sparsity of the Hamiltonian matrix [13]. The Arnoldi\nmethod has the twin merits that (i) a larger basis can be\nemployed, and (ii) it allows access to selected portions of\nthe spectrum. However, only a relatively small subset of\nresonances can be computed in this way [20].\nDistributions of resonances in the range 0.9 \u2264 ~ \u2264 1\nwere then computed. Figure 2 shows the complex resonance eigenvalues obtained for ~ = 1. By counting the\nnumber of states, N (~), in 8 different rectangular boxes of\nsize (1, 1.24~) located around Er = 1.8Es and averaging\nover these sets of data we were able to establish that the\nnumber of states follow a Weyl law with d = 1.231\u00b10.028\n(see lower inset in Fig. 2 ). Similarly, and also as shown\nin the figure, the dimension of the classical repeller of\nFig. 1 computed from the Poincar\u00e9 map is fractal with\ncorrelation dimension d2 = 1.442 \u00b1 0.008 where [21]:\nd2 = lim\n\ns\u21920\n\nln C2 (s)\n.\nln s\n\n(2)\n\n\f6.65\nln N\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\nd = 1.23\n\n6.50\n\n0\n\n3\n\n0.0\n\n1.5\nEr\n\n3.0\n\n\u22124.5 ln C2 \u22121.5\n\n\u22122\n\n\u0393\n\u22121\n\n0.00\n\n0.05\n0.10\n\u2212 ln (h 2\u03c0)\n\n(c)\n\n\u22121.00\n\nd2 = 1.44\n\u22120.25\n\u2212 ln s\n\n(i)\n\n0.50\n\nFIG. 2: Frame (a) shows resonance positions (Er ) and widths\n(\u0393) (scaled by the saddle point energy Es ) for ~ = 1. In (b)\nthe classical quantity ln C2 (s) is shown vs. ln s together with\na best fit to a line whose slope is the correlation dimension\n[see eq. (2)], i.e., d2 = 1.442 \u00b1 0.008. Frame (c) shows a\nbest fit to box counted quantum resonances with slope d =\n1.231 \u00b1 0.028. The quantum resonances scale as ~\u2212m/2 or\n~\u22121.22 [5] where m = (1 + d2 ) is the dimension of the trapped\nset; the quantum box counting dimension is 1.23. Despite\nconsidering a relatively narrow range of ~, lying far from the\nclassical limit the classical and quantum fractal dimensions\nagree well.\n\nHere s is the edge length of an n-dimensional cube and\nC2 (s) is the correlation sum [21]\nM\n1 X\n\u0398 (s \u2212 ||qnk \u2212 qnl ||)\nM\u2192\u221e M 2\n\nC2 (s) = \u2212 lim\n\napparent in the Husimi functions. The ~ \u2192 0 limit is\nitself of physical interest in that this limit corresponds,\ne.g., to the ionization of ultrahigh Rydberg states.\nBecause the Hamiltonian is complex and non(i)\n(i)\nHermitian the left, \u03a8L , and right, \u03a8R eigenfunctions\n(i)\n(i)\u2217\ndo not satisfy the usual (Hermitian) identity \u03a8L = \u03a8R\n(i) (i)\u2217\nand, consequently, \u03c1i = \u03a8L \u03a8R is a complex quantity.\n(i)\nIn fact, observables\nare associated with neither \u03a8L nor\nq\n\n(3)\n\nk,l=1\n\nwhere M is the number of points in the repeller, \u0398 is\nthe Heaviside step function and qk are the points of the\nrepeller. The fractal dimension, m, is related to the correlation dimension computed from a Poincar\u00e9 map as\nm = 1 + d2 [21]. Using the classical data we found that\nd2 = 1.442 \u00b1 0.008 which leads to a fractal dimension for\nthe repeller of m = 2.44.\nAccording to Ref. [5] the quantum resonances in an energy interval should scale as ~\u2212m/2 where m is the dimension of the trapped set for the energies in that interval.\nThis is in excellent agreement with quantum box counting since m/2 = 1.22 while the quantum box counting\ngives d = 1.23. This prediction is borne out remarkably\nwell by Fig. 2 and is an illustration of the fractal Weyl law\nin an open Hamiltonian system (rather than in a map).\nThe number of resonances in the boxes varied from 686\nto 827 depending on ~.\nIn addition to the conjecture that for generic open systems fractal Weyl law behavior will be observed, it is also\nexpected that Husimi functions will coagulate onto fractal sets (i.e., onto the repeller) in the limit ~ \u2192 0 [7].\nFor finite ~ Husimi functions will not truly be confined\nto fractal sets and will appear somewhat blurred due to\nquantum effects. However, as ~ is decreased then classical structures, on progressively finer scales, will become\n\n(i)\n\n(i)\n\n\u03a8R but with \u03a8L \u03a8R [22]. This complicates the computation of Husimi distributions as has been discussed\nby Buchleitner, et al. [23] who pointed out that Husimi\ndistributions for individual complex eigenstates have the\npeculiar property that they can be negative and a sum\nneeds to be made, in principle, over all complex energies [23]. For this reason, and, in analogy with previous\ncomputations in quantum maps, Husimi distributions are\naveraged over an energy range of finite width. We use\nthe following definition of the averaged Husimi function,\nwhose derivation includes both left and right eigenstates,\nand which is in the spirit of Bogomolny [7, 23, 24]\n\nX h\u03a8\u0304L (i) | R(\u03b8) |\u03a9i h\u03a8\u0304L (i) | R(\u03b8) |\u03a9\u0304i\n1\nIm\n.\n\u03c0\nEi\u03b8 \u2212 E\ni\n(4)\nHere \u03c6E represents the probability amplitude at real energy E and |\u03a9i is a coherent state; \u03a8L is a complex\nrotated eigenstate expressible in terms of the isotropic\noscillator basis vectors; Ei\u03b8 is the complex energy of the\neigenstate and the overbar notation signifies, e.g., that\nh\u03a8\u0304| is the complex conjugate of h\u03a8|; R(\u03b8) is the complex rotation operator [23]. Very recently, Ermann et al.\nhave proposed a different, although related phase space\nrepresentation for open quantum systems [12].\nFor narrow resonances simplifications of eq. (4) are\npossible. By projecting the states onto a basis of isotropic\noscillator functions one avoids computing basis vectors in\nthe complex coordinate plane, a procedure which is numerically unstable since basis vectors which are oscillatory along the real axis may diverge exponentially in the\ncomplex plane [23]. In this case one then needs to compute matrix elements of R(\u03b8) in the basis used although\nthese matrix elements themselves ultimately diverge - the\nresonance eigenfunctions are not L2 functions.\nWe adopted the following procedure to project the 4dimensional Husimi distribution onto a 2-dimensional hypersurface in phase space so as to generate a QSOS. A\nnarrow interval of energy was selected around some energy of interest E0 . Equation (4) was then used with the\nresonance eigenstates projected onto the isotropic oscillator basis. Only resonance states with widths smaller\nthan some width, \u03930 , were included in the summation\nand the matrix elements hn| R(\u03b8) |mi were approximated\nby their lowest order (i.e., diagonal) expansion in \u03b8. For\nstates with narrow widths, as is the case here, this is\nan excellent approximation. The QSOS was then com|h\u03a9 |\u03c6E i |2 =\n\n\f4\nthe asymptotic limit ~ \u2192 0 the resonance energies manifested clear fractal behavior and averaged Husimi distributions reflected rather faithfully the structure of the\nclassical repeller.\nWe acknowledge support from the Ministerio de Educaci\u00f3n y Ciencia (Spain) [projects MTM2006-15533,\nMTM2009-14621 and CONSOLIDER 2006-32 (i-Math)];\nthe Comunidad de Madrid [project S\u20130505/ESP-0158\n(SIMUMAT)]; a grant (to SDP) from NanoforumEULA\n(support action funded by the European Union), and the\nNSF (USA) through grant CHE-0718547.\n\nFIG. 3: (Color online) Contours of the averaged Husimi function calculated as described in the text superimposed on a representation of the classical repeller. Twenty resonance states\non each side of E = 1.8Es were included. The points which\nrepresent the classical repeller on the SOS have been kernel\nsmoothed which, in essence, assigns a local density of points\nand then colors that section of the plot accordingly [3] - compare to Fig. 1. The color scale runs from white through light\ngrey (yellow and light blue online) to dark grey (dark blue online) and represents the density from low to high accordingly.\n\nputed by fixing x = 0 and computing the conjugate momentum px using the classical Hamiltonian at energy E.\nBecause the boundary of the classically allowed region\nitself changes with energy this procedure is not entirely\nsatisfactory when computing an average Husimi QSOS.\nHowever, provided that the energy range is kept sufficiently small the errors so introduced are expected to be\nminimal and this was verified by direct computation.\nFigure 3 shows a typical example of a QSOS computed\nin this way. The averaged Husimi distribution is clearly\nlocalized on the fractal repeller sets K+ and K\u2212 which\nare also shown in the figure. However, this tendency for\nthe Husimi to coagulate onto the repeller is mitigated by\nthe relatively large value of ~ = 1 used in constructing\nthe figure. The Husimi distribution is somewhat delocalized over the repeller and does not precisely follow the\ncontours of the fine scale classical structures. It is also\napparent in Fig. 3 that the quantum density builds up\nclose to the saddle point. The reason for this is that the\nquantum particle senses the presence of classical turning points in the complex plane and, therefore, slows\ndown which leads to a build-up in probability density in\nthe vicinity of the saddle point. This is consistent with\nthe recent findings of Keating et al. who note that for\nlonger living states, the long lifetime allows interference\nand diffraction effects to accumulate thereby washing out\nthe fractal structure to some extent [11].\nIn summary: the fractal Weyl law was found to hold in\nan open Hamiltonian system.
