The insertion of new simple atomic systems in the range\nof experimental investigation can lead to significant progress in solving of these problems.\nThe measurement of muonic hydrogen Lamb shift at PSI (Paul Sherrer Institute) with a\nprecision of 30 ppm will allow to improve our knowledge of the proton charge radius by an\norder of the magnitude [2]. Another important problem is connected with the measurement\nof the ground state hyperfine splitting (HFS) in muonic hydrogen [3, 4]. In the case of\nelectronic hydrogen HFS was measured with extremely high accuracy many years ago [5]:\nexp\n\u2206EHF\nS = 1420 405 751.7667(9) kHz.\n\n(1)\n\nThe corresponding theoretical expression of the hydrogen hyperfine splitting can be writth\nth\nten in the form (\u2206EHF\nS = 2\u03c0h\u0304\u2206\u03bdHF S ) [6]:\n8 4 \u03bcP m2p m2e\nth\nQED\nS\nP\n\u2206EHF\n=\nE\n(1\n+\n\u03b4\n+\n\u03b4\n+\n\u03b4\n),\nE\n=\n\u03b1\n,\nF\nF\nS\n3 (mp + me )3\n\u2217\n\u2020\n\nfaustov@theory.sinp.msu.ru\nmart@ssu.samara.ru\n\n(2)\n\n\f2\nwhere \u03bcP is the proton magnetic moment, me , mp are the masses of the electron and proton.\nThe calculation of different corrections to the Fermi energy EF has a long history. Modern\nstatus in the theory of hydrogenic atoms was presented in details in [6]. \u03b4 QED denotes the\ncontribution of higher-order quantumelectrodynamical effects. Corrections \u03b4 S and \u03b4 P take\ninto account the influence of strong interaction. \u03b4 S describes the effects of proton finitesize and recoil contribution. \u03b4 P is the correction due to the proton polarizability. Basic\nuncertainties of theoretical result (2) are related with \u03b4 S and \u03b4 P .\n\nl\n\nl\n\nl\n\nl\n\nN\n\nN\n\nN\n\nN\n\nFIG. 1: Two-photon Feynman amplitudes determining the correction of the proton polarizability\nin the hyperfine splitting of the hydrogen atom.\n\nThe main part of the one-loop proton structure correction is determined by the following\nexpression (the Zemach correction) [7]:\n2\u03bc\u03b1 Z dp GE (p2 )GM (p2 )\n\u2206EZ = FF 2\n\u2212 1 = EF (\u22122\u03bc\u03b1)Rp .\n\u03c0\np4\n1+\u03ba\n\"\n\n#\n\n(3)\n\nThe Zemach radius Rp is determined by the densities of electric charge and magnetic moment. It is considered as a fundamental parameter of the proton structure along with the\nproton charge radius. There exist three possibilities to determine the numerical value Rp\n[8, 9, 10, 11]. One approach based on the analysis of the world data on e \u2212 p scattering\ngives Rp = 1.086 \u00b1 0.012 fm [8]. Another method uses the comparison of theoretical and\nexperimental results (1)-(2) for the hydrogen atom. In this case the value Rp = 1.043(16) fm\nis obtained in [9]. The third method can be based on the comparison of the future experimental data and theoretical result for muonic hydrogen [4, 11, 12]. The proton polarizability\ncorrection is important among other contributions of order 10\u22126 . Numerical estimation of\n\u03b4 P obtained in [13] serves at present as a reliable guide for defining the total value of the\nHFS in the hydrogen [8, 9, 10, 11].\nThe aim of this work consists in the investigation of the proton polarizability correction in\nthe hydrogen HFS. We performed new calculation of \u03b4 P using the isobar model describing\nthe processes of photo- and electroproduction of \u03c0, \u03b7 mesons, nucleon resonances on the\nnucleon in the resonance region, and on evolution equations for the parton distributions in\ndeep inelastic region.\n\n\f3\nII.\n\nGENERAL FORMALISM\n\nThe main contribution to \u03b4 P is determined by two-photon diagrams, shown in Fig. 1.\nThe corresponding amplitudes of virtual Compton scattering on the proton can be expressed\nthrough nucleon polarized structure functions G1 (\u03bd, Q2 ) and G2 (\u03bd, Q2 ). Inelastic contribution of the diagrams (a), (b) Fig. 1 can be presented in the form [13, 14, 15, 16, 17]:\nP\n\u2206EHF\nS =\n\n\u22061 =\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\n0\n\nZ\u03b1me\nEF (\u22061 + \u22062 ) = (\u03b41P + \u03b42P )EF = \u03b4 P EF ,\n2\u03c0mp (1 + \u03ba)\n\n(4)\n\ndQ2\nQ2\n\n(5)\n\n\u22062 =\n\n(\n\nZ \u221e\n9 2 2\nd\u03bd\n\u03bd2\n3\nG1 (\u03bd, Q2 ) ,\nF2 (Q ) \u2212 4mp\n\u03b21\n4\nQ2\n\u03bdth \u03bd\n\n\u221212m2p\n\n!\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\n0\n\ndQ2\nQ2\n\nZ\n\n\u03bd2\nG2 (\u03bd, Q2 ),\nQ2\n!\n\n\u221e\n\n\u03bdth\n\n)\n\nd\u03bd\u03b22\n\n(6)\n\nwhere \u03bdth determines the pion-nucleon threshold:\n\u03bdth = m\u03c0 +\n\nm2\u03c0 + Q2\n,\n2mp\n\n(7)\n\nq\n\n(8)\n\nand the functions \u03b21,2 have the form:\n\u03b21 (\u03b8) = 3\u03b8 \u2212 2\u03b82 \u2212 2(2 \u2212 \u03b8) \u03b8(\u03b8 + 1),\nq\n\n\u03b22 (\u03b8) = 1 + 2\u03b8 \u2212 2 \u03b8(\u03b8 + 1), \u03b8 = \u03bd 2 /Q2 .\n\n(9)\n\nF2 (Q2 ) is the Pauli form factor of the proton, \u03ba is the proton anomalous magnetic moment:\n\u03ba=1.792847351(28) [1].\nThe polarized structure functions g1 (\u03bd, Q2 ) and g2 (\u03bd, Q2 ) enter in the antisymmetric part\nof hadronic tensor W\u03bc\u03bd , describing lepton-nucleon deep inelastic scattering [18]:\n[S]\n[A]\nW\u03bc\u03bd = W\u03bc\u03bd\n+ W\u03bc\u03bd\n,\n[S]\nW\u03bc\u03bd\n\n= \u2212g\u03bc\u03bd\n[A]\nW\u03bc\u03bd\n\nq\u03bc q\u03bd\n+ 2\nq\n\n!\n\n= \u01eb\u03bc\u03bd\u03b1\u03b2 q\n\nP *q\nW1 (\u03bd, Q ) + P\u03bc \u2212 2 q\u03bc\nq\n\n\u03b1\n\n2\n\n(\n\nS\n\n2\n\u03b2 g1 (\u03bd, Q )\n\nP *q\n\n!\n\n(10)\nP *q\nP\u03bd \u2212 2 q\u03bd\nq\n\n!\n\nW2 (\u03bd, Q2 )\n,\nm2p\n\ng2 (\u03bd, Q2 )\n,\n+ [(P * q)S \u2212 (S * q)P ]\n(P * q)2\n\u03b2\n\n\u03b2\n\n)\n\n(11)\n(12)\n\nwhere \u01eb\u03bc\u03bd\u03b1\u03b2 is the totally antisymmetric tensor in four dimensions, g1 (\u03bd, Q2 ) =\nm2p \u03bdG1 (\u03bd, Q2 ), g2 (\u03bd, Q2 ) = mp \u03bd 2 G2 (\u03bd, Q2 ), P is the four-momentum of the nucleon, x =\nQ2 /2mp \u03bd is the Bjorken variable, S is the proton spin four-vector, normalized to S 2 = \u22121,\nq 2 = \u2212Q2 is the square of the four-momentum transfer. The invariant quantity P * q is\nrelated to the energy transfer \u03bd in the proton rest frame: P * q = mp \u03bd. The invariant mass of\nthe electroproduced hadronic system, W, is then W 2 = m2p + 2mp \u03bd \u2212 Q2 = m2p + Q2 (1/x \u2212 1).\nHere W1 and W2 are the structure functions for unpolarized scattering. In the DIS regime\nthe invariant mass W must be greater than any resonance in the nucleon. The threshold\nbetween the resonance region and the deep-inelastic region is not well defined, but it is\nusually taken to be at about W 2 = 4 GeV 2 .\n\n\f4\nHadronic tensor W\u03bc\u03bd is proportional to the imaginary part of the off-shell Compton\namplitude for the forward scattering of virtual photons on nucleons: \u03b3 \u2217 N \u2192 \u03b3 \u2217 N. The\nphoton-nucleon interaction depends on the photon polarization as well as on the nucleon\none. This gives four independent helicity amplitudes of the form Mab;cd , with a, b, c, d\nvalues for the helicities of the photon and nucleon initial and final states:\nM1,1/2;1,1/2 ,\n\nM1,\u22121/2;1,\u22121/2 ,\n\nM0,1/2;0,1/2 ,\n\nM1,1/2;0,\u22121/2 .\n\nThese components correspond to the four structure functions W1 , W2 , g1 , g2 . All other possible combinations of initial and final photon and nucleon helicities are related to the above\nby time reversal and parity transformation.\nThe proton spin structure functions can be measured in the inelastic scattering of polarized electrons on polarized protons. Recent improvements in polarized lepton beams and\nnucleon targets have made it possible to make accurate measurements of nucleon polarized\nstructure functions g1,2 in experiments at SLAC, CERN and DESY [19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24].\nThe spin dependent structure functions can be expressed in terms of virtual photonabsorption cross sections [18]:\n\"\n#\n\u221a\nm2 * K\n2 Q2\n2\n2\n2\n2\ng1 (\u03bd, Q ) = 2\n\u03c31/2 (\u03bd, Q ) \u2212 \u03c33/2 (\u03bd, Q ) +\n\u03c3T L (\u03bd, Q ) ,\n(13)\n8\u03c0 \u03b1(1 + Q2 /\u03bd 2 )\n\u03bd\n\"\n\n#\n\n2\u03bd\nm2 * K\n\u2212\u03c31/2 (\u03bd, Q2 ) + \u03c33/2 (\u03bd, Q2 ) + \u221a 2 \u03c3T L (\u03bd, Q2 ) ,\ng2 (\u03bd, Q ) = 2\n2\n2\n8\u03c0 \u03b1(1 + Q /\u03bd )\nQ\n2\n\n(14)\n\nwhere K is the kinematical flux factor for virtual photons, \u03c31/2 , \u03c33/2 are the virtual photoabsorption transverse cross sections for the total photon-nucleon helicity of 1/2 and 3/2\nrespectively, \u03c3T L is the interference term between the transverse and longitudinal photonP\nnucleon amplitudes. In this work we calculate contribution \u2206EHF\nS on the basis of the latest\n2\nexperimental data on the structure functions g1,2 (\u03bd, Q ) and theoretical predictions for the\ncross sections \u03c31/2,3/2,T L .\nThe proton polarizability contribution to HFS in the resonance region is determined by\nthe processes of photo- and electroproduction on nucleons of the pions and some prominent\nbaryon resonances. The amplitudes of such reactions are shown in Fig.2.\nTo obtain correction (4) in the resonance region (W 2 \u2264 4GeV 2 ) we use the Breit-Wigner\nparameterization for the photoabsorption cross sections in Eqs.(13)-(14), suggested in [25, 26,\n27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32]. In the considered region of the variables k 2 , W the most contribution is\ngiven by five resonances: P33 (1232), S11 (1535), D13 (1520), P11 (1440), F15 (1680). Accounting\nthe resonance decays to the N\u03c0\u2212 and N\u03b7\u2212 states we can express the absorption cross\nsections \u03c31/2 and \u03c33/2 as follows:\n\u03c31/2,3/2 =\n\nkR\nk\n\n!2\n\nW 2 \u0393\u03b3 \u0393R\u2192N \u03c0\n4mp\n|A1/2,3/2 |2 ,\n2 2\n2\n2\n2\n(W \u2212 MR ) + W \u0393tot MR \u0393R\n\n(15)\n\nwhere A1/2,3/2 are transverse electromagnetic helicity amplitudes,\n\u0393\u03b3 = \u0393R\n\nk\nkR\n\n!j 1\n\n2\nkR\n+ X2\nk2 + X 2\n\n!j 2\n\n, X = 0.3 GeV.\n\n(16)\n\n\f5\n\n=\n\n+\n\n+\n\n+\n\n:::\n\nFIG. 2: Feynman amplitudes for the proton polarizability correction in the resonance region.\nSolid, double solid, wave and dashed lines correspond to nucleon, baryon resonance, photon and\npion correspondingly.\n\nThe resonance parameters \u0393R , MR , j1 , j2 , \u0393tot are taken from [27, 28, 33, 34].

Here q (k) and qR (kR ) denote the c.m.s. pion (photon) momenta of\nresonances with the mass M and MR respectively. In the case of S11 (1535) we take into\naccount \u03c0N and \u03b7N decay modes [29, 34]:\n\u0393R\u2192\u03c0,\u03b7 =\n\n2\n2\nq\u03c0\u03b7\n+ C\u03c0,\u03b7\nq\u03c0,\u03b7\n,\nb\u03c0,\u03b7 \u0393R 2\n2\nq\nq + C\u03c0,\u03b7\n\n(19)\n\nwhere b\u03c0,\u03b7 is the \u03c0 (\u03b7) branching ratio.\nThe cross section \u03c3T L is determined by an expression similar to Eq.(15), containing the\n\u2217\nproduct (S1/2\n* A1/2 + A\u22171/2 S1/2 ) [19]. The calculation of helicity amplitudes A1/2 , A3/2\nand longitudinal amplitude S1/2 , as functions of Q2 , was done on the basis of constituent\nquark model (CQM) in [35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40]. In the real photon limit Q2 = 0 we take\ncorresponding resonance amplitudes from [33].\nThe two-pion decay modes of the higher nucleon resonances (S11 (1535), D13 (1520),\nP11 (1440) and F15 (1680) were described phenomenologically using two-step process as in\n[27]. The high-lying nucleon resonance R can decay first into N \u2217 (P33 (1232) or P11 (1440))\nand a pion or into a nucleon and \u03c1- or \u03c3-meson. Then the new resonances decay into a\nnucleon and a pion or two pions:\nR\u2192r+a=\n\n(\n\nN \u2217 + \u03c0 \u2192 N + \u03c0 + \u03c0,\n\u03c1(\u03c3) + N \u2192 N + \u03c0 + \u03c0.\n\n\f6\n\n0.1\n0\n-0.1\n-0.2 g1\n-0.3\n1.2\n\n1\n0.75\nQ2 , GeV2\n\n1.4\n0.5\n\n1.6 W, GeV\n0.25\n\n1.8\n0 2\n\nFIG. 3: The proton polarized structure function g1 (W, Q2 ) as the function of variables Q2 (0 \u00f7 1)\nGev 2 and W (1.1 \u00f7 2.0) GeV .\n\nThe total decay width of such processes can be presented as a phase space weight integral\nover the mass distribution of the intermediate resonance r = N \u2217 , \u03c1, \u03c3 (a = \u03c0, N):\n\u0393R\u2192r+a (W ) =\n\nP2\u03c0\nW\n\nZ\n\nW \u2212ma\n\n0\n\nd\u03bc*pf\n\n\u03bc2 \u0393r,tot (\u03bc)\n(MR \u2212 m2 \u2212 2m\u03c0 )2 + C 2\n2\n, (20)\n\u03c0 (\u03bc2 \u2212 m2r )2 + \u03bc2 \u03932r,tot (\u03bc) (W \u2212 m2 \u2212 2m\u03c0 )2 + C 2\n\nwhere C = 0.3 GeV , the factor P2\u03c0 must be taken from the constraint condition:\n\u0393R\u2192r+a (WR ) coincides with the experimental data, pf is the three momentum of the resonance r in the rest frame of R. \u0393r,tot is the total width of the resonance r.

In the unitary isobar model accounting the Born terms, the vector meson,\nnucleon resonance contributions and the interference terms we calculated the cross sections\n\u03c3T,L by means of numerical program MAID (http://www.kph-uni-mainz.de/MAID) in the\nresonance region as the functions of two variables W and Q2 . The obtained nucleon polarized structure functions g1,2 (W, Q2 ) are presented in Figs.3-4. These results for the structure\nfunction g1 (W, Q2 ) are in qualitative agreement with experimental data. The particular significance in the study of the spin-dependent properties of baryon resonances belongs to\nGerasimov-Drell-Hearn (GDH) sum rule [41]\n\u03ba2\n1 Z \u221e d\u03bd\n\u2212\n= 2\n[\u03c31/2 (\u03bd, 0) \u2212 \u03c33/2 (\u03bd, 0)].\n4m22\n8\u03c0 \u03b1 \u03bdth \u03bd\n\n(22)\n\nThe GDH sum rule rests on the basic physical principles and an unsubtracted dispersion\nrelation applied to the forward Compton amplitude.\nTo construct the spin-dependent structure functions of the proton in deep inelastic region\nwe can use the Q2 evolution equations for the quark and gluon distributions [42]:\nx\nx\n\u03b1s Z 1 dy\ndqi (x, Q2 )\nqi (y, Q2)Pqq\n+ g(y, Q2)Pqg\n=\n2\nd ln Q\n2\u03c0 x y\ny\ny\n\"\n\n!\n\n!#\n\n,\n\n(23)\n\n\f8\n\u03b1s\ndg(x, Q2 )\n=\n2\nd ln Q\n2\u03c0\n\nZ\n\n1\n\nx\n\n\"\n\n!\n\ndy X\nx\nx\n+ g(y, Q2)Pgg\nqi (y, Q2 )Pgq\ny\ny\ny\ni\n\n!#\n\n,\n\n(24)\n\nwhere the sum is considered over all quarks and antiquarks. Pqq , Pgq , Pqg , Pgg are the\nquark-gluon splitting functions [43]. Numerical solution of the integrodifferential evolution\nequations (23), (24) by means of the method suggested in [44] allows to obtain the parton\ndistributions and the structure functions g1,2 (x, Q2 ) for different values of a photon momentum squared Q2 . Corresponding numerical results are in good agreement with the world\nexperimental data [19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24].\nIII.\n\nNUMERICAL RESULTS\n\nIn this paper we calculate the proton polarizability correction to the hyperfine splitting\nof the ground state in the hydrogen atom on the basis of the isobar model describing the\nprocesses of low-energy scattering of virtual photons on nucleons and the evolution equations\nfor the parton distributions. These two significant ingredients of the calculation allow to\nconstruct the absorption cross sections for transversely and longitudinally polarized photons\nby nucleons and to express the structure functions g1,2 (W, Q2 ) (13), (14), which determine\nrequired contribution (4).\nThe values of contributions \u03b41P , \u03b42P and the total contribution \u03b4 P , obtained after the\nnumerical integration in the resonance and nonresonant regions are as follows in electronic\nand muonic hydrogen correspondingly:\n\u03b41P = 2.6 ppm, \u03b42P = \u22120.4 ppm, \u03b4 P = (2.2 \u00b1 0.8) ppm,\n\n(25)\n\n\u03b41P = 5.18 \u00d7 10\u22124 , \u03b42P = \u22120.48 \u00d7 10\u22124 , \u03b4 P = (4.70 \u00b1 1.04) \u00d7 10\u22124 .\n\n(26)\n\nThe difference of obtained number for electronic hydrogen from the result of our previous\nwork (1.4 \u00f7 0.6) ppm [13] is connected with new contributions (nonresonant background in\nthe resonance region and two pion decays of the resonances) which we considered in this\nstudy. There exists a number of theoretical uncertainties associated with quantities entering\nin the correction (4). In the improved isobar model [31, 45, 46] containing 14 resonances,\nwe can omit theoretical error which arises due to the insertion of other high-lying nucleon\nresonances. On our sight the main theoretical error is closely related with the calculation\nof the helicity amplitudes A1/2 (Q2 ), A3/2 (Q2 ), S1/2 (Q2 ) in the quark model based on the\noscillator potential [18]. Only systematical experimental data for the helicity amplitudes\nof the photoproduction on the nucleons A1/2 (0), A3/2 (0) are known with sufficiently high\naccuracy to the present [33]. In the case of amplitudes for the electroproduction of the\nnucleon resonances experimental data contain only their values at several points Q2 . So,\nwe have no consistent check for the predictions of the oscillator model. Possible theoretical\nuncertainty connected with the calculation of amplitudes A1/2 (Q2 ), A3/2 (Q2 ), S1/2 (Q2 ) with\nthe account of relativistic corrections can attain the value of order 10%. Then the theoretical\nerror for the correction (4) in the resonance region comprises 20% from the obtained value.\nWe solved DGLAP equations in the NLO approximation, so possible uncertainty in \u03b4 P can\ncomprise near 10% of obtained result in the nonresonant region. The other source of the\ntheoretical uncertainty arises from the experimental data errors in the Q2 \u2264 1 GeV 2 region.\nWe estimated it at a level of about 20% of the contribution \u03b4 P at Q2 \u2264 1 GeV 2 in the\nnonresonant region.\n\n\f9\n\nd\u03a3\nd\u03a3\n\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080T\u0080 +\u0395 \u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080L\u0080 H\u039cb\u0090srL\nd\u0398\nd\u0398\n\n20\n17.5\n15\n12.5\n10\n7.5\n5\n2.5\n1100\n\n1200\n\n1300\n\n1400\n1500\nWHMeVL\n\n0\n\nd\u03a3TL\n\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\n\u0080 H\u039cb\u0090srL\nd\u0398\n\n-0.5\n-1\n-1.5\n-2\n-2.5\n1100\n\n1200\n\n1300\n\n1400\n\n1500\nWHMeVL\n\n1600\n\n0\n\nd\u03a3TT\n\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\n\u0080 H\u039cb\u0090srL\nd\u0398\n\n-2\n-4\n-6\n-8\n\n1100\n\n1200\n\n1300\n\n1400\n\n1500\n\n1600\nWHMeVL\n\nFIG. 5: Plots of \u03c0 + virtual photoproduction cross sections at Q2 = 0.4 GeV as the functions of\nthe W (1100 \u00f7 1600) M eV , obtained on CLAS detector.
