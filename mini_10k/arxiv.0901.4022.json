They have simple\ngeometry and clear-cut rules for how stress caused by\na failed element is redistributed on undamaged fibers.\nSince these models can be analyzed to an extent that is\nnot possible for more complex materials, they have been\nmuch studied (For reviews, see [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]). The statistical distribution of the size of avalanches in fiber bundles\nis well studied [6, 7, 10], and the failure dynamics under\nconstant load has been formulated [8] through recursion\nrelations which in turn explore the phase transitions and\nassociated critical behavior in these models.\nIn this article we present a way to predict when an\nover-loaded bundle collapses, by monitoring the fiber\nbreaking rate.\nWe focus on the equal-load-sharing models, in which\nthe load previously carried by a failed fiber is shared\nequally by all the remaining intact fibers [11, 12, 13, 14].\nWe consider a bundle consisting of a large number N of\nelastic fibers, clamped at both ends (Fig. 1). The fibers\nobey Hooke's law with force constant set to unity for\nsimplicity. Each fiber i is associated with a breakdown\nthreshold xi for its elongation. When the length exceeds\nxi the fiber breaks immediately, and does not contribute\nto the strength of the bundle thereafter. The individual thresholds xi are assumed to be independent random\nvariables with the same cumulative distribution function\nP (x) and a corresponding density function p(x):\n\nProb(xi < x) = P (x) =\n\nZ\n\nx\n\np(y) dy.\n\n0\n\n(1)\n\nx\n\nF\nFIG. 1. The fiber bundle model.\n\nIf an external load F is applied to a fiber bundle, the\nresulting failure events can be seen as a sequential process\n[8]. In the first step all fibers that cannot withstand\nthe applied load break. Then the stress is redistributed\non the surviving fibers, which compels further fibers to\nfail, etc. This iterative process continues until all fibers\nfail, or an equilibrium situation with a nonzero bundle\nstrength is reached. Since the number of fibers is finite,\nthe number of steps, tf , in this sequential process is finite.\nAt a force (or elongation) x per surviving fiber the total\nforce on the bundle is x times the number of intact fibers.\nThe expected or average force at this stage is therefore\nF (x) = N x (1 \u2212 P (x)).\n\n(2)\n\nThe maximum Fc of F (x) corresponds to the value xc for\nwhich dF/dx vanishes. Thus\n1 \u2212 P (xc ) \u2212 xc p(xc ) = 0.\n\n(3)\n\nWe characterize the state of the bundle as pre-critical or\npost-critical depending upon the stress value \u03c3 = F/N\nrelative to the critical stress\n\u2217 Electronic\n\u2020 Electronic\n\naddress: srutarshi.pradhan@sintef.no\naddress: per.hemmer@ntnu.no\n\n\u03c3c = Fc /N,\n\n(4)\n\n\f2\n\n[N P (N \u03c3/Nt )]\n\n(5)\n\nof fibers will have thresholds that cannot withstand the\nload, and consequently these fibers break immediately.\nHere [X] denotes the largest integer not exceeding X.\nThe number of intact fibers in the next step is therefore\nNt+1 = N \u2212 [N P (N \u03c3/Nt )] .\n\n10\n\n6\n\n10\n\n5\n\n10\n\n4\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n10\n\n7\n\n10\n\n6\n\n(6)\n\nR(t)\n\nNt\nN\n\n7\n\nt\n\nSince N is a large number, the ratio\n\nnt =\n\n10\n\nR(t)\n\nWe study the stepwise failure process in the bundle, when\na fixed external load F = N \u03c3 is applied.

It has a minimum after a number of\nsteps t0 of the degradation process, and we have demonstrated that the total bundle collapse occurs near 2t0 .\nThe demonstration has been performed for three different distributions of fiber thresholds, but the result is\ndoubtlessly universal. Thus the fact that the breaking\nrate has a minimum predicts not only that a global failure will occur, but also estimates when it will occur.\n\n[7] S. Pradhan, A. Hansen and P. C. Hemmer, Phys.
