A way to select a single rule of quantization is proposed by\nrequiring of consistency of the quantum mechanics' following from the canonical and\nquasiclassical approaches. This rule selects also a unique definition of the path integration.\nA geometric interpretation of noncovariance of the canonical Hamilton operator with\nrespect to diffeomorphisms of the configuration space is proposed.\n\n\u2217\n\nquant-ph/0101016\n\n1\n\n\f1\n\nIntroduction\n\nVarious procedures of quantization (canonical, path integration, quasiclassical, deformational)\nof classical mechanics are more or less well\u2013developed mathematical theories. However, being\nused to construct the quantum mechanics (QM)1 for a concrete classical system, the procedures\noccur to be ambiguous. For example, the result of canonical quantization depends generally\non the definition of ordering of operators of observables in their products, see, e.g., [1], though\nthere is no ambiguity for the standard oscillator\u2013like systems. This ambiguity manifests itself\nalso in the path integral formalism, see, e.g., [2]. This situation does not trouble apparently\nthe mathematicians, because they consider different versions of the same approach, as cohomologically equivalent [3]. However, the ambiguities are essential in physics, because they can\nlead, for example, to different Hamilton operators and, thus, are unequivalent from a physicist's\npoint of view.\nA point-like, chargless and spinless particle moving along a geodesic of the n \u2013dimensional\nRiemannian space Vn is an especially interesting example of a system, to which different\nQMs correspond under canonical quantization. This is the simplest and, therefore, elementary\nphysical\nobject, and its dynamics has a clear geometrical meaning. At the same time, there are a\nlot of more complicated conceptual systems whose dynamics can be modelled as a motion in\nsome Vn (see, e.g. [4]).\nIn the present paper, it is shown that the ambiguity of ordering of operators can be removed\nif the condition of consistency (to an extent that can be reached) between the canonical and\nquasiclassical approaches to QM of the elementary particle in Vn is imposed. At first sight, it\nlooks strange to deduce a general rule of ordering\nfrom the consideration of a concrete system, and, moreover, from the consideration of a\nparticular operator of an observable, namely, the Hamilton one. However, if the rule is supposed\nto be universal, and only a single version is provided by the condition of the consistency in the\nparticular but fundamental and geometrically determined case, then it is natural to accept the\nselected rule as the general one. After that, it selects \"the physically true\" definition of the\npath integral.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In Sec.2, the form of the Hamilton operator originally\nobtained by B.DeWitt [5] from the quasiclassical (WKB) propagator is discussed. The general\nscheme of canonical quantization and its particular versions determined by the Weyl and Rivier\norderings are recalled in Sec.3. In Sec.4, the Hamilton operators in QM in Vn for the mentioned\norderings are written out and compared with the DeWitt's one; it is shown here that the\nconsistency can be achieved only for a single combination of the Weyl and Rivier orderings. This\n1\n\nI will use the term 'quantum mechanics' for the restricted problem of quantization of the minimal set of\nobservables that is necessary to describe the dynamics of a physical system, while 'quantization' will mean a\nmore general problem of mapping from a sublalgebra of the Poisson algebra of functions on a phase space onto\na set of operators on a Hilbert space, or for modifications of this problem.\n\n2\n\n\fcombination is proposed as a distiguished rule of canonical quantization in general. Relation of\nthe selection of the rule of ordering to definition of the path integral for propagator is discussed\nin Sec.5. Short conclusions are made in Sec.6.\n\n2\n\nQuasiclassical quantum potential\n\nLet \u03c9ij (\u03be), i, j, k, ... = 1, ..., n, {\u03be i } \u2208 Vn , is the metric tensor of Vn , the latter being\nsupposed an elementary manifold. Then the representation space (the space of states) can\n\u221a\nbe taken as L2 (Vn ; C; \u03c9 dn \u03be) . The general form of a one-particle Hamilton operator in the\nSchr\u00f6dinger representation is the same for the canonical and quasiclassical approaches2 :\n\u01240 = \u2206(\u03be) + Vq (\u03be) * 1\u0302,\n\n\u03be \u2208 Vn ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u2206(\u03be) is the Laplace\u2013Beltrami operator in Vn and Vq (\u03be) is the so called quantum\npotential.\nIn the quasiclassical approach, DeWitt [5] came to the Hamilton operator (1) with\nVq(DW) (\u03be) = \u2212\n\n~2 1\nR(\u03be),\n2m 6\n\n(2)\n\ninstead of the expected Vq (\u03be) = 0 ; here R(\u03be) is the scalar curvature .\nDeWitt [5] started with the following conjecture on a one-particle propagator3:\n\u0013\n\u0012\ni\n\u2032\n\u2032\n< \u03be \u2032, t\u2032 |\u03be, t >= \u03c9 \u22121/4 (\u03be \u2032)D 1/2 (\u03be \u2032 |\u03be)\u03c9 \u22121/4(\u03be) exp \u2212 S(\u03be , t |\u03be, t)\n~\n\n(3)\n\nwhere D is the Van Vleck determinant, and S(\u03be \u2032, t\u2032 |\u03be, t) is a solution of the Hamilton\u2013Jacobi\nequation in both the sets of arguments. This propagator is a generalization to Vn of the WKBpropagator constructed by Pauli [6] for a particle in an electromagnetic field in the flat space.\nConsidering the limit t\u2032 \u2192 t (\u03be \u2032 \u2192 \u03be) along the geodesic line\nconnecting \u03be \u2032 and \u03be , DeWitt comes to the following Schr\u00f6dinger equation\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\n\u2202\n~2\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2206(\u03be ) + R(\u03be ) < \u03be \u2032 |\u03be >= o(\u03be \u2032 \u2212 \u03be)) < \u03be \u2032 |\u03be >\ni~ \u2032 < \u03be |\u03be > +\n(4)\n\u2202t\n2m\n6\nand, thus, to eq.(2).\nThis was an outstanding result that surprised DeWitt himself, because it was for the first\ntime when the curvature appeared explicitly in a fundamental equation, thus breaking the\n(weak) Principle of Equivalence. (A clear exposition of the Principle can be found in [7]). Since\n2\n\nThe index 0 is attached to \u01240 for consistency with notation in [10, 12] where it denotes a nonrelativistic\nHamilton operator. In the present context, relativistic and nonrelativistic classical theories are equivalent and\nthe corresponding quantum ones can differ (This is one more problem of quantization.) Thus, QM is considered\nhere on a nonrelativistic level, see also [12]\n3\nHere, I change slightly the notation in eq.(7.8) in [5] and restrict the consideration to the time\u2013independent\nmetric tensor \u03c9ij (\u03be)\n\n3\n\n\fbeginnings of QM there was a confidence that Vq (\u03be) = 0 , based on the work by Podolski [8]\non QM in the curvilinear coordinates in the Euclidean space. Much later, Sniatycki [9] came\nto the same result using the Blattner-Kostant-Sternberg kernel in the framework of geometric\n(DW)\nquantization. At last, for n = 3 , there is a support in favor of Vq\n(\u03be) from the relativistic\nN\ntheory of scalar field: for the space-time T\nV3 eq.(1), is a non-relativistic consequence of the\nquantum theory of a scalar field coupled conformally to the geometry, (see details in [10]).\nConsider now the general scheme of the canonical formalizm.\n\n3\n\nCanonical quantization in Vn\n\nN\nWe start with the phase space X2n = R\u2217 Vn , the trivial cotangent bundle over the configurational space Vn , in which the Darboux (canonically conjugate) coordinates\n{pi } \u2208 Rn\u2217 ,\n\n{\u03be i } \u2208 Vn\n\n(5)\n\nare introduced. We assume also that all coordinate lines for {\u03be i } are complete and not closed,\nthat is \u2212\u221e < \u03be i < \u221e . In this sense, \u03be i } are similar to the Cartesian coordinates; this assumption is necessary because, in the canonical quantization, one starts usually with polynomials\nas observables and genereralize the class of functions by use of the Fourier transforms [1]. A\nphysical interpretaion of this very restrictive assumption is that local manifestations of the\nspace curvature are taken into account.\nFor our purposes, quantization (see, e.g., [11]) can be defined as a map\nQ : F2n \u220b f (p, \u03be) \u2212\u2192 f\u02c6 (an operator acting in H \u2261 L2 (Vn ; C;\n\n\u221a\n\n\u03c9 dn \u03be)),\n\n(6)\n\nwhere F2n is an appropriate subalgebra of the Poisson algebra of C \u221e (X2n ) \u2013functions; the\nmap Q is assumed to satisfy the following postulates of quantization:\n1) 1 \u2192 1\u0302 ;\ndef\n2) {f, g} \u2192 i~\u22121 (f\u02c6\u011d \u2212 \u011d f\u02c6) = i~\u22121 [f\u02c6, \u011d] where {., .} is the Poisson bracket on X2n ;\n3) f\u02c6 = (f\u02c6)\u2020 where the overline and the dagger denote, respectively, the complex conjugation and the Hermitean conjugation with respect to the inner product in H ;\n4) for a complete set of functions f 1 (x), ..., f n (x), f i \u2208 F (X2n ), ({x}\nh \u223c {p,\ni \u03be}) \u2208 X2n ) ,\n1\nn\ni\n\u02c6\n\u02c6\n\u02c6\n\u02c6\nthe corresponding operators f , ..., f also form a complete set, that is, if f , f = 0 for any\ni = 1, ..., n , then\nf\u02c6 = f\u02c6(f\u02c61 , ..., f\u02c6n ) .\nThe real functions f (x) \u2208 F (X2n ) are observables for a classical system on X2n . The\nDarboux coordinates are particular cases of such functions, and, since any f (x) can be expressed through these coordinates, the latter can be called basic classical observables. The\n\n4\n\n\f\u221a\ncorresponding quantum operators of the observables acting in L2 (Vn ; C; \u03c9 dn \u03be) are [5]\n1\nQ\nQ\n(7)\n\u03be i \u2212\u2192 \u03be\u02c6i = \u03be i * 1\u0302, pj \u2212\u2192 p\u0302j = \u2212i~(\u2202j + \u2202j ln \u03c9)\n4\nQ\nThe main problem is further to construct the map f (p, \u03be) \u2212\u2192 f\u02c6 in terms of the basic\nobservables p\u0302, \u03be\u02c6i . In the canonical approach, one proceeds as follows [1]:\n1) Starts with (real) polynomial observables:\nX j ...j\nfi11...ikl \u03be i1 ...\u03be ik pj1 ...pjl ;\nf (p, \u03be) = f +\n\n(8)\n\na,b\n\n2) substitutes pj , \u03be i by p\u0302j , \u03be\u02c6i , respectively;\n3) hermitizes the obtained operator by a certain rule of ordering of p\u0302j , \u03be\u02c6i ;\n4) generalizes the rule, if possible, to a class of observables f (p, \u03be) wider, than that of polynomials.\nThere are infinitely many realizations of this scheme. They are classified, e.g., in [14]. Consider now two examples, one of which, the Weyl ordering, is the most popular one, and the\nboth of them are important for our further consideration.\nExample 1. According to [1], the Weyl ordering as applied to polynomial (8) consists in\ncomplete symmetrization of operators p\u0302 and q\u0302 in each monomial in the right-hand side of\neq.(8) after substitutions pi \u2192 p\u0302i , q j \u2192 q\u0302 i . The result can be represented in Vn as\nf (p, \u03be)\n\nQ\n\n\u2212\u2192 (f\u02c6\u03c8)(\u03be)\n\n= (2\u03c0~)\u2212n \u03c9\n\n\u2212 41\n\n(\u03be)\n\nZ\n\n\u0013\ni i  \u0303i\nn \u0303 n\nd \u03be d p exp \u2212 (\u03be \u2212 \u03be )pi f\n~\n\u0012\n\n!\n1\n\u03be + \u03be \u0303\n \u0303 \u03c8(\u03be).\n \u0303 (9)\n\u03c9 4 (\u03be)\np,\n2\n\nFurther, this result is taken as a rule determining an operator f\u02c6 for any function f (p, \u03be) for\nwhich the expression has a meaning.\nExample 2. Rivier [13] proposed a correspondence that is equivalent to the following one\nQ\n\nf (p, \u03be) \u2212\u2192 (f\u02c6\u03c8)(\u03be)\n\u0013\n\u0012\nZ\nf (p, \u03be) + f (p, \u03be\u0303) 1  \u0303\ni i  \u0303i\n\u2212n \u2212 41\nn \u0303 n\n \u0303 (10)\n\u03c9 4 (\u03be) \u03c8(\u03be).\n= (2\u03c0~) \u03c9 (\u03be) d \u03be d p exp \u2212 (\u03be \u2212 \u03be )pi\n~\n2\nAn argument in favor of this rule was that it provides one-to-one correspondence between\ninfinitesimal canonical transformations on X2n and infinitesimal unitary transformations in\nH . It is easily shown that the Rivier rule of quantization (10) leads to the following ordering\nof each term in (8): .\n1 \u02c6i1 \u02c6ik\n(\u03be ...\u03be p\u0302j1 ...p\u0302jl + p\u0302j1 ...p\u0302jl \u03be\u02c6i1 ...\u03be\u02c6ik )\n2\nA question of fundamental importance is: which rule of ordering should be used to obtain\nQM of the most elementary physical system, a point-like, spinless and chargeless particle, if\nexternal gravitation is switched on in the form of nontrivial time-independent space metric?\n5\n\n\f4\n\nQuantum Mechanics of Geodesic Motion in Vn\n\nHaving the correspondence (7) and reducing the general problem of quantization to a formulation of QM corresponding to the geodesic motion of a particle , one should only construct a\nquantum counterpart for the Hamilton function\nH0 =\n\n1\n\u03c9 ij (\u03be) pi pj\n2m\n\n(11)\n\nwhere m is the mass of the particle According to the scheme given above, the problem consists\nin the choice of ordering of operators\ndef\n\u02c6 = \u03c9 ij (\u03be) * 1\u0302.\n\u03be\u02c6i , p\u0302j , \u03c9\u0302 ij = \u03c9 ij (\u03be)\n\nNote that the metric tensor becomes now an operator determined in fact by the von Neumann\nQ\nQ\nrule for quantization [15]: if f \u2212\u2192 f\u02c6 , then g(f ) \u2212\u2192 g(f\u02c6) . Then, the variety of natural\norderings which give f\u02c6 = f\u02c6\u2020 for f (p, \u03be) = f (p, \u03be) , is exhausted by linear combinations of the\nWeyl and Rivier orderings considered above. However, other more exotic versions of ordering\nmight be introduced by representing \u03c9 ij as a product of other observables and taking their\nsymmetrizations with p\u0302i and p\u0302j , as it is done in [16], but we do not consider here these\npossibilities.\nThe Hamilton operators for the Weyl and Rivier orderings are, respectively,\n(Weyl)\n\n\u01240\n\n(Riv)\n\n\u01240\n\n1\n\u02c6 + 2 p\u0302i \u03c9 ij (\u03be)\n\u02c6 p\u0302j + \u03c9 ij (\u03be)\n\u02c6 p\u0302i p\u0302j )\n(p\u0302i p\u0302j \u03c9 ij (\u03be)\n8m\n1\n\u02c6 + \u03c9 ij (\u03be)\n\u02c6 p\u0302i p\u0302j )\n=\n(p\u0302i p\u0302j \u03c9 ij (\u03be)\n4m\n\n=\n\n(12)\n(13)\n\nUsing representation (7) for the basic operators, after some algebra, one obtains both the\nHamilton operators in the form of eq.(1) with a quantum potential, respectively,\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\n1\n1 ij\n~2\n(Weyl)\nij\nij\n\u2206(\u03be) + \u2202j (\u03c9 \u03b3i ) + \u2202i \u2202j \u03c9 + \u03c9 \u03b3i \u03b3j\n(14)\n\u01240\n= \u2212\n2m\n2\n4\n4\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\n1 ij\n~2\n(Riv)\nij\n\u2206(\u03be) + \u2202j (\u03c9 \u03b3i ) + \u03c9 \u03b3i \u03b3j\n(15)\n\u01240\n= \u2212\n2m\n2\n4\n(16)\ndef\n\nwhere \u03b3i = \u03b3 k ki , and \u03b3 k ij are the Christoffel symbols for metric tensor \u03c9ij .\nOne sees that the quantum potentials in both the cases are noncovariant, with respect to\ndiffeomorphisms of Vn , though the \"kinematic\" term \u2212(~2 /2m)\u2206(\u03be) is a scalar operator. It\ncan be explained by that the coordinates \u03be i play in the theory a two-fold role: they provide Vn\nby a manifold structure and, at the same time, as a part of 2n coordinates of the phase space\nX2 n , they are classical observables. Correspondingly, \u03be\u02c6i form a complete set of quantum\nobservables, in terms of which the preparation and observation of a state of the system is\nperformed.\n6\n\n\fThe dependence of the quantum dynamics on a choice of observables (that form \"the quantum statics\" according to [17]) via the Hamilton operator is hidden in the standard QM in the\nflat space by use of Cartesian coordinates as position observables, for which Vq = 0 . There,\na use of curvilinear cordinates, e.g., the spherical ones, is done a posteriori, after introduction\nof the Hamilton operator in terms of basic observables which are firmly related to Cartesian\ncoordinates. The curvilinear coordinates are used only as an auxiliary mathematical tool and,\nthus, play only the first part of the two-fold role mentioned above. The situation changes\ndrastically in Vn where one forced to use curvilinear coordinates as\nbasic observables from the begining, and the problem of noncovariance of the quantum\npotential arises inevitably.\n~2\n\u2206(\u03be) as a postulate. However, it\nThis problem is often circimvented by taking \u01240 = \u2212 2m\nleads us out the framework of the canonical formalism, and, what is much worse, one comes\nthen to noncovariance of the exponent term in the path integral, see [2] and Sec.5 of the present\npaper.\nAdopting the line which we has taken, return now to the Hamilton operators 14,15. It is easy\nto see that no linear combination of them can produce a scalar quantum potential. However,\n(new)\nthere is a combination \u01240\nwhich is consistent with Hamilton operator 4 in a particular\nclass of coordinates (and, consequently, of the position observables).\n(Weyl)\n(Riv)\nTo show this, consider \u01240\nand \u01240\nin the normal quasi-Cartesian system of coordia\ni\nnates {y }, with its origin at the point \u03be ; indices a, b, ... = 1, ..., n are further used to denote\ncomponents of objects in the coordinate system {y a} . In these coordinates, the values of y a\nat an arbitrary point \u03be \u2032i are y a = ha s where s is the distance along the geodesic connecting\npoints \u03be i and \u03be \u2032 i , and ha are components of the tangent vector to the geodesic with respect\nan orthonormal n -tuple at the origin \u03be \u2032i .\nIn the normal quasi-Cartesian system, the metric tensor \u03c9ab ,\nits derivatives with respect to y a , and, consequently, the Christoffel symbols \u03b3 a bc (y) can\nbe expressed as a power series with coefficients that are polynomials of components of the\ncurvature tensor\nRa bcd = \u2202d \u03b3 a bc \u2212 \u2202c \u03b3 a bd + \u03b3 a de \u03b3 e bc \u2212 \u03b3 a ce \u03b3 e bd\nand of the covariant derivatives of the tensor. Then, using the Veblen method of affine extensions [18] and the contracted Bianchi identities, one obtains the following representations for\nHamilton operators:\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\n1\n~2\n(Weyl)\na\n2\n\u2206(y) + R|y=0 + (\u2202a R)|y=0 y + O(y ) .\n(17)\n\u01240\n(y) = \u2212\n2m\n4\n4\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\n~2\n2\n\u2206(\u03be) + R(\u03be) + O(s ) .\n(18)\n= \u2212\n2m\n4\n\u0012\n\u0013\n~2\n1\n1\n(Riv)\na\n2\n\u01240 (y) = \u2212\n\u2206(y) + R|y=0 + (\u2202a R)|y=0 y + O(y ) .\n2m\n3\n3\n\n7\n\n\f~2\n= \u2212\n2m\n\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\n2\n\u2206(\u03be) + R(\u03be) + O(s ) .\n3\n\n(19)\n\n(In transitions from eq.(17) to eq.(18) and from eq.(19) to eq.(19), asymptotic relation\nR(\u03be \u2032 ) = R(\u03be) \u2212 \u2202i R(\u03be i \u2212 \u03be \u2032i ) = R(\u03be) \u2212 \u2202i R(xi)(\u03be i \u2212 \u03be \u2032i ) + O(s2 ) = R(\u03be) \u2212 \u2202a R(y)|y=0 ha s + O(s2)\nis used). It is seen from here that a Hamilton operator with any coefficient of\n(Weyl)\n(Riv)\nR(\u03be) can be obtained by appropriate linear combination of \u01240\n(y) and \u01240\n. Our\naim is to get a local consistency between a certain ordering rule in canonical quantization and\nthe WKB result eq.(4) in the neighborhood of the origin \u03be \u2032i , We see easily that combination\n(new)\n\n\u01240\n\n(Weyl)\n\n(Riv)\n\n(y) = 2\u01240\n(y) \u2212 \u01240 (y)\n\u0012\n\u0013\n2\n1\n~\n2\n\u2206(\u03be) + R(\u03be) + O(s )\n= \u2212\n2m\n6\n\n(20)\n\nis just the Hamilton operator in the Schr\u00f6dinger equation (4) in the approximation indicated\nthere.\nIn terms of the basic operators p\u0302j , \u03be\u02c6i\n1\n\u02c6 p\u0302j ,\np\u0302i \u03c9 ij (\u03be)\n(21)\n2m\nthat is the simplest of possible Hermitean expressions which can be constructed from p\u0302i , p\u0302j and\n\u02c6 .\n\u03c9 kl (\u03be)\nThe further logic is very simple. If an ordering rule is universal for quantization of any\nf (x, p) \u2208 F then one should consider the combination of the Weyl and Rivier orderings in the\nright-hand side of eq.(20) as the general rule of ordering distinguished by the condition of local\ncoincidence of WKB and canonical QMs. The corresponding general formula of quantization\nis the combination of quantizations (9) and (10)\n(new)\n\n\u01240\n\nf (p, \u03be)\n\n=\n\nQ\n\n\u2212\u2192\n=\n\n5\n\n(f\u02c6\u03c8)(\u03be)\n\u0012\n\u0013\u0010\ni i  \u0303i\n\u03be + \u03be \u0303\n2f (p,\n)\n(2\u03c0~) \u03c9 (\u03be) d \u03be d p exp \u2212 (\u03be \u2212 \u03be )pi\n~\n2\n \u0303\u0011 1\nf (p, \u03be) + f (p, \u03be)\n \u0303 \u03be).\n \u0303\n\u03c9 4 (\u03be)\u03c8(\n\u2212\n2\n\u2212 14\n\n\u2212n\n\nZ\n\nn \u0303 n\n\n(22)\n\nThe path integral and canonical formalism\n\nIn the path integral formalism one usually starts with the following formal expression for the\npropagator\ni\n\n\u2032\u2032 \u2212t\u2032 )\u0124\n\nK(\u03be \u2032\u2032 , t\u2032\u2032 |\u03be \u2032, t\u2032 ) =< \u03be \u2032\u2032|e\u2212 ~ (t\n\n0\n\n|\u03be \u2032 >\n\n(23)\n\nwhich is proposed to be approximated as\nZ NY\nN\n\u22121\n\u22121\nY\np\ni\nn\n\u2032\u2032 \u2032\u2032 \u2032 \u2032\nK(\u03be , t |\u03be , t ) = lim\n\u03c9(\u03beA ) d \u03beA\n< \u03beA |e\u2212 ~ \u01eb\u01240 |\u03beB >\nN \u2192\u221e\n\nB=1\n\nA=1\n\n8\n\n(24)\n\n\fwhere \u01eb = (t\u2032\u2032 \u2212 t\u2032 )/N and \u03be0 = \u03be \u2032 , \u03beN = \u03be \u2032\u2032 . The problem is: from where does one know the\nHamilton operator \u01240 from? At least, the following answers are possible:\n1) To find it from experiments.\n\u221a\n2) To postulate it as a differential operator in L2 (Vn ; C; \u03c9dn \u03be) ; the standard postulate is\n\u2212(~/2m2 )\u2206 .\n3) To quantize canonically H0 (cl) , solving somehow the problem of ambiguities.\n4) To conjecture the form of K(\u03be \u2032\u2032 , t\u2032\u2032 |\u03be \u2032, t\u2032 ) for t\u2032\u2032 \u2192 t\u2032 and to determine \u01240 from the\nasymptotic Schr\u00f6dinger equation ; this is just the Pauli\u2013DeWitt way [5].\n5) To deduce the Schr\u00f6dinger equation as an asymptotic of the corresponding quantum\nfield theory, as it is done in [10].\nConsider approach 2) to the path integration following [2], where the reader is referred for\ndetails. These authors, as many others, consider the general covariance of \u01240 as a necessary\ncondition. (From my point of view, it is a sort of prejudice that does not take into attention\nthe two-fold role of coordinates mentioned above.) Having taken the standard expression\n\u2212(~/2m2 )\u2206\n, one should express it in terms of the basic operators p\u0302i , q\u0302 j . To this end, one should to take\nany canonically obtained Hamilton operator and to subtract the nonvanishing noncovariant\nquantum potential\nVq corresponding to the ordering chosen. (In [2], the latter is the Weyl ordering). After\nthat, Vq will be inevitably present in the exponential of any resulting form of the path integral.\nFor example, it reads in the lagrangean form [2]\n\u0013\u03c0N/2 NY\nZ \u0012\n\u22121\np\n1\n\u2032\u2032 \u2032\u2032 \u2032 \u2032\n\u03c9(\u03beA ) dn \u03beA\nK(\u03be , t |\u03be , t ) = lim\nN \u2192\u221e\n2\u03c0i~\u01eb\nA=1\n\u0012\n\u0013\u0015\n\u0014\nN\n\u22121\n1/4  \u0303\nY\ni (eff)  \u0303 \u03beB \u2212 \u03beB\u22121\n\u03c9 (\u03be B )\n(25)\nexp \u01ebL\n\u03beB ,\n\u00d7\n1/4\n[\u03c9(\u03be\n)\u03c9(\u03be\n)]\n~\n\u01eb\nB\nB\u22121\nB=1\n\nwhere L(eff) (\u03be, \u03be\u0307) = L(cl) (\u03be, \u03be\u0307) \u2212 Vq (\u03be) and \u03be \u0303 denotes that the value of the function f taken in\na special way depending on the ordering chosen; if the Weyl one is adopted, then\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u03beA \u2212 \u03beA\u22121\ndef\n \u0303\n)\nf (\u03be A ) = f\n2\n\n; for the ordering introduced in the present paper\n\u0012\n\u0013\nf (\u03beA ) + f (\u03beA\u22121 )\n\u03beA + \u03beA\u22121\ndef\n \u0303\nf (\u03beA ) = 2f\n\u2212\n2\n2\nThus, we come to the conclusion that the direct canonical approach, that does not appeal\nto the general covariance, leads to L(eff) (\u03be, \u03be\u0307) = L(cl) (\u03be, \u03be\u0307) in eq.(25) that corresponds better\nto the original Feynman idea. However, a dependence of the path integral on the choice of\nordering remains in the form of a rule of evalution of f (\u03be \u0303A ) .\n9\n\n\f6\n\nConclusion\n\nThe approach adopted here can be considered as a sort of a \"physical\" experiment with different\nmathematical schemes of quantization. A physical system (point-like particle moving along a\ngeodesic in Vn ) taken as a probe is the simplest geometrically and physically meaningful one\nwhen the ambiguities of quantization clearly manifest themselves. At the same time, the system\nis sufficiently fundamental that the results obtained by its consideration might be used to select\na preferred version of the canonical quantization, in general. The system considered reveals\nalso a dependence of the quantum dynamics on the choice of the basic observables (on \"the\nquantum statics\") . In particular, this question seems to be important for such fundamental\nproblem as quantization of gravitation where a separation of the proper dynamics of the\ngravitational field from effects of the choice of coordintes is one of the main dificulties. In any\ncase, our knowledge of the quantum theory would not be complete without clear realization\nthe basic questions considered here.\nAcknowledgement\nThe author is deeply grateful to the Russian Foundation for Basic Research which supported\nthis work by Grant No 00-01-00871 and to Professor B.M.Barbashov for a useful discussion.\n\nReferences\n[1] Berezin F A, Shubin M A 1983 Schr\u00f6dinger equation (Moscow University Press, Moscow;\nin Russian)\n[2] D'Olivo J C and Torres M 1989 J.Phys A.: Math., Gen. 21 3355\u20133363.\n[3] Bayen F , Flato M , Frionsdal C , Lichnerowicz A and Sternheimer D Ann.Phys.
