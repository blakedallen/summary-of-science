Robertson\nDepartment of Physics,\nUniversity of Washington, Seattle, WA 98195\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe neutrino remains as exotic and challenging today as it was seventy years ago when\nfirst proposed by Pauli. What is known for certain about neutrinos is minimal indeed.\nThey have spin 21 , charge 0, helicity -1, and exist in 3 flavors, electron, mu, and tau.\nStrictly speaking, only 2 flavors are certain: direct observation of the tau neutrino has\nnot yet been achieved, but an experiment, DONUT, at Fermilab is in progress with\nthis objective[1]. Limits on the masses from direct, kinematic experiments (that do\nnot require assumptions about the non-conservation of lepton family number), have\nbeen steadily lowered by experiments of ever-increasing sophistication over the years,\nwith the results given in Table 1. As will be discussed below, lower limits on \u03bde\nfrom tritium beta decay exist [3, 4], but the data show curious distortions near the\nendpoint that are not at present understood.\nThere are strong theoretical and experimental motivations to search for neutrino\nmass. Presumably created in the early universe in numbers comparable to photons,\nneutrinos with a mass of only a few eV would contribute a significant fraction of the\nclosure density. A species with a mass of 94h20 eV, where h0 is the Hubble constant\nin units of 100 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 , provides by itself the closure density, but the structure\nof the universe at small and intermediate scales is incompatible with the dominance\nof hot dark matter such as neutrinos. On the other hand, evidence has accumulated\nfrom surveys of galaxy distributions and of the cosmic microwave background that is\nconsistent with the presence of some hot dark matter.\nIn gauge theories of the elementary particles, the fermion masses arise from the\ncoupling of left- and right-handed fields. A Dirac mass for neutrinos is expected to be\nlike the quark and charged-lepton masses, but experiment has shown that neutrino\nmasses are tiny. For this reason the minimal Standard Model deprives neutrinos\nof right-handed fields, forcing them to be always relativistic and massless. A clear\ndemonstration that neutrinos have mass forces a confrontation of our understanding\nof how mass is generated.\nSensitivity to very small neutrino masses is experimentally accessible if neutrino\nmass eigenstates are not flavor eigenstates. In that case, a state prepared by the\n1\n\n\fweak interaction (W+/\u2212 decay) in a specific flavor projection consists of two or more\nphysical mass components propagating slightly differently with time or distance. A\nremote detector with specific flavor sensitivity will then register 'a neutrino' with\naltered flavor projection as a result of the phase difference that accumulates. Because\nthe neutrinos are in general highly relativistic, the phase difference increases not as\nthe difference in the masses, but as the difference \u2206m2 between the squares of the\nmasses.\nIf neutrino oscillations occur, the kinematic limits in Table 1 must be understood\nto refer to appropriately weighted averages of mass eigenstates.\nIn general, the mass and flavor bases are related by a unitary transformation\nsimilar to the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa mixing matrix in the quark sector. In\nthe neutrino sector, the matrix is called the Maki-Nakagawa-Sakata (MNS) matrix\n[5] . The customary 3-flavor version of the MNS matrix is given by Mann [6].\nThe CKM matrix is a 3-flavor matrix and one of its most intriguing features is the\npresence of a free complex phase that provides a natural origin for CP violation within\nthe Standard Model. The MNS matrix has at least this degree of freedom, but in the\nneutrino sector neutrino-antineutrino mixing can occur as well, giving neutrinos both\nDirac and Majorana properties. The MNS matrix is then at least a 6-dimensional one,\nand can presumably have additional free complex phases. CP violation in neutrinos\nis potentially a very interesting phenomenon, although experimentally challenging\nsince, as Fisher et al. show [8], it is necessary to be able to track the oscillatory\nnature of three flavor components at once. Neutrinoless double beta decay is also a\nCP microscope, if the mass sensitivity needed can be reached.\nThere are now 3 experimental signals indicative of neutrino oscillations and mass.\nThe implications, especially if all 3 are correct, are explored below. The reader is\nreferred to the reviews in these proceedings by Suzuki [9], Mann [6], and DiLella [7]\nfor a discussion of these epochal experiments.\n\nTable 1: The kinematic mass limits for neutrinos, compared to the known masses of\ntheir charged-lepton partners [2]\nElectron Family \u03bde < 15 eV\ne\u2212 510999.06 eV\nMu Family\n\u03bd\u03bc < 170 keV\n\u03bc\u2212 105658.389 keV\nTau Family\n\u03bd\u03c4 < 18 MeV\n\u03c4 \u2212 1777.1 MeV\n\n2\n\n\f2\n\nAccelerator and Reactor Oscillation Experiments\n\nFrom the initial experiment discovering the neutrino in 1957 to the present day,\nreactors and accelerators have been a mainstay of research into the properties of\nneutrinos. Extensive and modern reviews of the subject are given by DiLella [7] and\nFisher et al. [8].\nCertain recent experiments stand out as particularly influential in shaping our\npresent view of the properties of neutrinos:\n\u2022 The Liquid Scintillator Neutrino Detector (LSND) experiment [10] at Los Alamos\nNational Laboratory has found evidence for \u03bd \u03bc \u2192 \u03bd e with 0.2 \u2264 \u2206m2 \u2264 2.0\neV2 and 0.04 \u2265 sin2 2\u03b8 \u2265 0.0015. Confirmatory evidence has been obtained in\nthe charge-conjugate channel \u03bd\u03bc \u2192 \u03bde .\n\u2022 The KARMEN Experiment [11] at Rutherford-Appleton Laboratory reports no\nsignal in a region of parameter space overlapping much of that explored by\nLSND. The small remaining region defines the parameters just given for LSND,\nplus a small island at \u2206m2 = 4.5 eV2 , sin2 2\u03b8= 2.5 x 10\u22123 .\n\u2022 The Brookhaven E776 Experiment [12] excludes (in the \u03bd\u03bc \u2192 \u03bde channel) the\nsmall island at 4.5 eV2 .\n\u2022 The Chooz long-baseline reactor antineutrino experiment [13] shows that \u03bd e\ndoes not transform to anything for \u2206m2 \u2265 10\u22123 eV2 , sin2 2\u03b8\u2265 0.1. The Palo\nVerde experiment [11] confirms this, at somewhat lower significance. These\nnegative results are remarkably decisive in ruling out substantial atmospheric\n\u03bd\u03bc \u2194 \u03bde conversion and also in blocking any possibility of large-\u2206m2 , large-angle\nsolutions to the solar neutrino problem.\nTogether with the results from atmospheric and solar neutrino measurements,\nthese define the scenarios for neutrino mass and mixing that are most likely.\n\n3\n\nAtmospheric Neutrinos\n\nThe experiments designed to search for proton decay, IMB [14] and Kamiokande\n[15], were obliged to deal quantitatively with atmospheric neutrino interactions as\nthe major background to proton instability. It was known that the cosmic ray flux\nand resulting production rate of neutrinos in the upper atmosphere were uncertain\nat the level of about a factor of 2, but it gradually became apparent that the ratio\nof \u03bd\u03bc + \u03bd\u03bc to \u03bde + \u03bde was also not well predicted. The latter ratio, naively 2 (from\npion and muon decay) and calculable to an accuracy of about 5%, was found to\nbe low by a factor of typically 0.6. As it depends little on the cosmic-ray flux and\n3\n\n\fnormalization, the departure from the expected value was somewhat surprising, and\nneutrino-oscillation solutions were proposed. Towards the end of the operation of\nKamiokande, evidence was accumulating for a zenith-angle dependence of the ratio\n(equivalent to a path-length dependence).\nSuperKamiokande has now been in operation since April, 1996, with a fiducial mass of approximately 22,500 tons acquiring events at 10 times the rate of\nKamiokande. Other detectors, MACRO and Soudan II, have also been accumulating\ndata. The present situation is summarized in the comprehensive review by Mann [6].\nEvidence consistent with neutrino oscillation has emerged in the form of:\n\u2022 An atmospheric neutrino flavor ratio (\u03bd\u03bc /\u03bde ) 0.68 the expected magnitude,\n\u2022 A zenith-angle dependence in the \u03bd\u03bc flux that departs greatly from the nooscillation expectation and agrees closely with an oscillation description, and,\n\u2022 A zenith-angle dependence in the \u03bde flux that agrees closely with the nooscillation expectation.\nIn addition, the zenith-angle dependence significantly favors (by about 2\u03c3) the\n\u03bd\u03bc \u2192 \u03bd\u03c4 channel over the \u03bd\u03bc \u2192 \u03bds channel when matter effects are taken into account.\nThe best-fit oscillation parameters are,\n\u2206m2 = 3.5 \u00d7 10\u22123 eV2\nsin2 2\u03b8 = 1.0\nThere is no evidence for the subdominant oscillation \u03bd\u03bc \u2192 \u03bde channel at the same\nmass difference, from which one can set a limit of about 0.05 on the square of the\nNMS matrix element Ue3 in a 3-flavor description [6].\nAre there any possible loopholes? The following points can be, and in some cases\nhave been, made:\n\u2022 The \"R\" value, the ratio of \u03bc-flavor to e-flavor observed compared to that\ncalculated, is smaller than expected for the oscillation parameters constrained\nby the zenith-angle dependence [16].\n\u2022 The experimentally measured value of the rate for inclusive CC reactions of \u03bd\u03bc\non 12 C is about a factor 2 smaller than calculated, whereas the corresponding\n\u03bde reaction has the expected rate [7].\n\u2022 Recoil-order terms in the neutrino-nucleon cross sections, particularly the pseudoscalar form factor, have apparently been neglected. The pseudoscalar contribution has an effect of several percent in the ratio R (because it contains the\ncharged lepton mass), and may have a significantly larger role in the angular distributions where it appears as an interference term. The angular distributions\nare used to extract the zenith-angle dependence.\n4\n\n\f\u2022 The zenith-angle dependence, a very convincing aspect of the evidence for oscillation because it is so model-independent, does in fact depend on the extent to\nwhich pions and muons range out in the earth before decaying, and hence also\non the altitude at which they are produced, the primary cosmic-ray spectrum,\ninteraction cross sections, etc.\nNone of these points is thought to constitute a major concern, and neutrino oscillation appears to be the logical explanation for the results.\n\n4\n\nSolar Neutrinos\n\nThe sun, it is believed, generates its energy by fusion reactions that can be summarized as\n4p + 2e\u2212 \u2192 4 He + 2\u03bde + 26.731 MeV.\nEach cycle through the hydrogen-burning process produces 2 electron neutrinos and\nit follows directly that the neutrino flux at the Earth's surface is proportional to the\nthermal energy flux, which is an experimentally measured quantity. The electromagnetic solar constant (irradiance) I = 0.1367 W cm\u22122 . With a small correction (about\n1%) for the energy carried away by the neutrinos themselves, the neutrino flux at\nthe Earth's surface is 6.44 x 1010 cm\u22122 s\u22121 , independent of detailed models of the\nsun. It is necessary only that the sun be in hydrostatic equilibrium over a period\nconsiderably longer than the photon migration time, 10,000 years.\nIn practice, no detector presently exists that can measure the total flux of solar\nneutrinos. Detectors have thresholds and strongly energy-dependent sensitivities.\nIn hydrogen burning, a number of pathways lead to 4 He, and a complex spectrum\nof neutrinos from pp, pep, 7 Be, hep, 13 N, 15 O, 17 F, and 8 B results. The spectral\nshape of each individual component, whether line or continuum, is determined by\nlaboratory measurement and/or electroweak theory. The relative intensity of each\ncomponent, on the other hand, depends strongly on the temperature and composition,\nand therefore on astrophysical models of the sun. The flux component most easily\ndetected, 8 B, is also the most temperature sensitive, varying as the 25th power of\nthe central temperature, and it is moreover a component so minor (0.01%) that it is\nunconstrained by the sun's energy output.\nData from 5 experiments (3 different types of experiment) provide information on\ndifferent combinations of the fluxes. The current results are summarized in Table 2. It\nis very surprising that, with only 3 independent types of measurement and 8 different\nneutrino sources in the sun, it is impossible to fit the data (well) without introducing\nneutrino oscillations or some other non-standard-model physics! This comes about\nqualitatively as follows:\n\n5\n\n\f\u2022 The hep flux, as will be discussed, is negligibly small in the flux balance, and is\nknown to be so from the high-energy part of the SK solar neutrino spectrum.\n\u2022 The pep flux is tied to the pp flux in a way that depends very weakly (as the\nsquare root of the temperature) on models.\n\u2022 The CNO and 7 Be neutrinos are detected both by Cl-Ar and by Ga-Ge, but\nnot by Kamiokande and SK. While they cannot be individually disentangled in\na model-independent analysis, that is not required to demonstrate the inconsistency of standard-physics solutions with the data.\nConsequently, there are really only 3 relevant neutrino sources, namely pp + pep, 7 Be\n+ CNO, and 8 B. There are also 3 independent experimental measurements, plus, if\none elects to apply it, the luminosity constraint that relates the neutrino flux to solar\nenergy output.\n\nTable 2: Results of the\natom per second).\nCl-Ar\nKamiokande\nSuperKamiokande\nSAGE\nGallex\n\n5 solar neutrino experiments (1 SNU = 10\u221236 events per\n2.56 \u00b1 0.16 \u00b1 0.16 SNU\n(2.80 \u00b10.19 \u00b1 0.33) x 106 8 B \u03bde cm\u22122 s\u22121\n(2.45 \u00b10.04 \u00b1 0.07 ) x 106 8 B \u03bde cm\u22122 s\u22121\n+3.5\n67.2+7.2\n\u22127.0 \u22123.0 SNU\n78\u00b16 \u00b1 5 SNU\n\n[17]\n[18]\n[9, 19]\n[20]\n[21]\n\nThere is no combination of the fluxes with all fluxes non-negative [22, 23, 24] that\nfits the data. With the luminosity constraint applied to the total flux, the statistical\nsignificance of this conclusion is now at about the 3.5\u03c3 level; of course, it depends\non there not being large unknown systematic errors in the data or in the detectors'\nneutrino cross sections, but it does not depend on models of the sun. Even if the\nluminosity constraint is abandoned (equivalent to allowing variability of the solar core\nover times of order 30\u201310,000 years, or more exotic possibilities), there is no solution\nat about the 2\u03c3 level.\nIf the experimental errors have been properly estimated, then, this contradiction\nmeans that one of the assumptions made in fitting the data must be incorrect, and\nthere are very few assumptions.\nIt must be concluded that the shape of the 8 B spectrum is not as expected, containing more strength at high energies and less at low, and/or the neutrino flavor content\nis not pure electron, which alters the relationship between the water-\u010cerenkov results\nand the radiochemical experiments (because elastic scattering, unlike inverse beta decay, can occur via the neutral-current interaction with neutrinos of all active flavors).\n6\n\n\fTable 3: Two-flavor neutrino oscillation fits to the solar neutrino data, in the framework of the Bahcall-Basu-Pinsonneault Standard Solar Model [24].\nSolution\n\u03bde \u2192\n\u2206m2\nsin2 \u03b8 \u03c72min\neV2\nLarge-angle Active 1.8 x 10\u22125 0.76\n4.3\nSterile 19\n\u22126\nSmall-angle Active 5.4 x 10\n0.006\n1.7\nSterile 4.6 x 10\u22126 0.007\n1.7\nLow\nActive 7.9 x 10\u22128 0.96\n7.3\nSterile 17\nVacuum\nActive 8.0 x 10\u221211 0.75\n4.3\nSterile 12\n\nThese features, not permitted in the Minimal Standard Model, are characteristic of\nneutrino-oscillation solutions[22]. In contrast to the standard-physics solution, such\nsolutions can give an excellent account of all data.\nThe need for non-standard physics (presumably neutrino oscillations) is modelindependent at the roughly 3.5-\u03c3 level, but the derivation of specific oscillation parameters is done in the context of astrophysical solar models [24] and experimental\nnuclear-physics inputs. Qualitatively, there are three 2-flavor solutions that describe\nthe data reasonably well, and a fourth with a lower probability. These are termed\nthe Large-Mixing-Angle [LMA], the Small-Mixing-Angle [SMA], the 'LOW', and the\nvacuum solutions; see Fig. 1. Table 3 summarizes the fit results within the framework\nof a standard solar model [24].\nIf neutrino oscillations are indeed the explanation of the solar neutrino problem,\nindependent evidence for them might arise from:\n\u2022 Spectral distortions in the 8 B flux,\n\u2022 Day-night variations indicative of MSW regeneration in the Earth,\n\u2022 Yearly variations beyond those expected from the Earth's orbital eccentricity,\nand\n\u2022 Neutral-current interaction rates larger than expected from measured chargedcurrent rates.\nThe SuperKamiokande collaboration is continuing a program of careful energy\ncalibration and accumulation of high-statistics data in search of a distortion of the\nspectrum. The expected effects are quite small at best and, at the upper end of the\n7\n\n\fFigure 1: MSW solutions (rates only, 99% CL) for active neutrinos (left) and sterile\nneutrinos (right) [25].\n\nspectrum, vanishingly small for all but the vacuum solutions. There are, moreover,\nsources of distortion unrelated to neutrino physics:\n\u2022 The possible presence of hep neutrinos (3 He + p \u2192 3 H + e+ + \u03bde + 18.7\nMeV)[26, 27]. The hep spectrum is considerably harder than the 8 B one, and\ncontributes extra intensity in the vicinity of the 8 B endpoint at 15 MeV and\nbeyond (to the 19-MeV endpoint of the hep spectrum). Calculation of the rate of\nthe reaction is difficult because the lowest-order Gamow-Teller matrix element\nis small owing to the near orthogonality of the radial wavefunctions; forbidden\nterms dominate. Fortunately, comprehensive first-principles calculations of the\nrate, including the higher partial waves that contribute in the solar plasma,\nhave been recently reported [28, 30]. Horowitz [28] made the first calculation\nof the continuum 3 P0 axial-charge transition, finding the S-factor to be\nS0,p (E) = 1.7 \u00d7 10\u221217 eV b,\nwhich is almost as large as the 'standard' s-wave component in use heretofore\n[29],\nS0,s (E) = 2.3 \u00d7 10\u221217 eV b.\nSchiavilla [30] reports:\nS0,s (E) = 3.9 \u00d7 10\u221217 eV b\n8\n\n\fS0,p (E) = 2.4 \u00d7 10\u221217 eV b\nS0,d (E) \u2264 1 \u00d7 10\u221218 eV b,\nfor all the s, p, and d partial waves, respectively. The energy-dependence of S0,i\nis negligible for all partial waves, and thus\nS0 (E) = 6.3 \u00d7 10\u221217 eV b\nis an accurate value for this rate for the purposes of neutrino flux calculations.\nWhile 3 times larger than the value in previous use, it falls short of the 16.7\ntimes needed to account fully for distortions being seen in SuperKamiokande\n[9].\n\u2022 The shape of the neutrino spectrum from 8 B decay is not directly calculable since\nthe final state (in 8 Be) is broad. The spectrum is inferred from the recoil alpha\nspectra in laboratory experiments having other objectives [31]. Preliminary\nresults of measurements at Notre Dame University [32] specifically designed to\naddress some possible systematic concerns indicate that the standard spectrum\nunderpredicts the intensity in the endpoint region by a fraction that peaks at\nabout 14% 2 MeV below the endpoint.\n\u2022 The beta decay of 8 B to the 8 Be ground state is second-forbidden and has not\nbeen observed. With similar transitions (e.g. 36 Cl) as a guide, it can be expected\nto have a branch of order 10\u22123. Its spectrum would in that case be similar in\nboth magnitude and energy to the hep spectrum.\nIt is at the moment too soon to draw conclusions concerning neutrino oscillations\nfrom the shape of the spectrum at high energies, but the experimental and theoretical\nuncertainties are rapidly being reduced. One can expect before long to have a useful\nconstraint on oscillation solutions from the spectral shape.\nDay-night effects arise from matter regeneration in the varying path through the\nearth's core, and are less dependent on details. No certain evidence for time variations\nbeyond statistical fluctuations has shown up to date, but the most recent data from\nSK [9] yield a two-standard deviation effect,\nN \u2212D\n= 0.065 \u00b1 0.031 \u00b1 0.013.\nN +D\nThe absence of large day-night effects has already ruled out a large region of parameter\nspace in the range 10\u22126 \u2264 \u2206m2 \u2264 10\u22125 eV2 and 10\u22122 \u2264 sin2 2\u03b8. As Suzuki [9] shows\n(for further discussion, see also Bahcall et al. [33]), the small but general night\nenhancement matches better with the LMA solution (the lower part, in the vicinity\nof sin2 2\u03b8=1.0, \u2206m2 = 1.9 x 10\u22125 eV2 ) than it does the SMA solution where effects\n9\n\n\fFigure 2: LMA solution, active neutrinos.

The details of the LMA region are\nshown [33] in Fig. 2.\nThe fact that information on solar neutrino solutions was present in atmospheric\nneutrino data was evidently first noted by Giunti et al. [34]. The solar LMA solution\nis only valid for mixing with active, not sterile, neutrinos [25]. Hence this solution\nis in conflict with either the LSND experiment or the indications that the dominant\natmospheric signal is \u03bd\u03bc \u2212 \u03bd\u03c4 . If LMA were nevertheless the correct solution, upwardgoing electron neutrinos from the atmosphere would convert appreciably and equally\nto \u03bc and/or \u03c4 neutrinos, potentially causing a deficit in \u03bde and an increase in \u03bd\u03bc . The\nvacuum oscillation length is\nE\u03bd\nL0 = 2.47\n\u2206m2\n10\n\n\fwhen distances are in km, energies in GeV, and masses in eV. For the LMA solution,\n\u2206m2 \u2243 3 \u00d7 10\u22125 and the oscillation length becomes one earth diameter (13,000 km)\nat a neutrino energy of 160 MeV. An inspection of Figs. 2 and 15 in Mann's paper [6],\nshows, if anything, a slight excess in the low-energy \u03bde up-down asymmetry. Peres\nand Smirnov show [35], however, that when the calculation is done in detail and\nmatter effects are taken into account, the excess is in fact expected for much of the\natmospheric and LMA parameter space. The fact that the \u03bd\u03bc flux is intrinsically\nabout 2 times the \u03bde flux and that both oscillation solutions are near maximal mixing\nconspire to produce effects that may be of either sign, depending on the specific\nparameter values.\nThe implication is that the LMA solution may be favored by the atmospheric\nand solar neutrino data, good news for the KamLAND experiment, a reactor \u03bd e\nexperiment that reaches the LMA parameter space, as DiLella has described [7].\nYearly time dependence is the hallmark of vacuum oscillation solutions as the\nearth's orbital eccentricity explores different oscillation phases. The eccentricity is\nsmall (a total 3.5% distance variation), and for the continuous neutrino spectrum\nemitted by 8 B and detected with detectors having relatively poor energy resolution,\nthe effects are hard to see. It will be very different when high-statistics detectors\nprimarily sensitive to 7 Be neutrinos (e.g. Borexino [36]) come on line, because the\nnarrow line width of the source leads to striking time-dependence in the vacuum\noscillation signal.\nThe question of the ratio of charged to neutral currents will be addressed in the\nSudbury Neutrino Observatory[37], a 1000-tonne heavy-water \u010cerenkov detector now\noperating 2000 m underground in the INCO Creighton nickel mine near Sudbury,\nOntario. SNO will permit observation of both the charged-current (CC) inverse beta\ndecay of the deuteron:\nd + \u03bde \u2192 p + p + e\u2212 \u2212 1.44 MeV\nand the neutral-current (NC) neutrino breakup reaction:\nd + \u03bdx \u2192 p + n + \u03bdx \u2212 2.22 MeV\nThe nuclear-physics uncertainties in the cross sections for these two processes arise\nmainly from the final states, which are members of the same isospin triplet. As a\nresult, the ratio expected is known to a precision of order 1%, and significant departures (e.g. a factor of 3, as present solar neutrino information would suggest) would\npoint unequivocally to neutrino oscillations to an active species. If the oscillation is to\nsterile neutrinos, there are nevertheless spectroscopic and time-dependent signatures\nthat may be measurable.\nIn addition to the NC/CC ratio, SNO will provide good information on the shape\nof the 8 B spectrum above 5 MeV because in the CC reaction on deuterium the energy\n11\n\n\fof the incident neutrino is transferred largely to the electron. Sensitivity to day-night\nand yearly effects is similar to that of SuperKamiokande, but the spectroscopic resolution permits the energy-dependence of such effects to be investigated efficiently. The\nquasi-elastic CC cross section rises quadratically with energy, and the backgrounds\nat the 2000-m depth of SNO are low, so detection of hep neutrinos may be possible.\n\n5\n\nInterpreting the Results\n\nThe width of the Z0 permits the existence of 3 light neutrinos and their antineutrinos\nthat couple universally to the weak interaction. If only three different mass eigenstates\nmi , i = 1, 2, 3, exist, the mass splittings must satisfy\nX\n\n\u2206m2\u03bd = (m23 \u2212 m22 ) + (m22 \u2212 m21 ) + (m21 \u2212 m23 ) = 0,\n\n(1)\n\nSplittings\n\na trivial condition which is not met by any combination of the independent \u2206m2\u03bd from\nexperimentally favored neutrino mass differences (Table 4).\nHow can this difficulty be evaded? One must either assume that an experimental\ndatum is incorrect (or at least misinterpreted), or that a fourth neutrino type exists,\none that does not couple to the weak interaction significantly. Specific remedies that\nhave been proposed are,\n\u2022 A sterile neutrino that mixes with one or more active species.\n\u2022 Reject the LSND result. Although there is evidence for the effect in both \u03bd \u03bc \u2192\n\u03bd e and \u03bd\u03bc \u2192 \u03bde , the effect has not been seen in other experiments that explore\nsimilar, but not identical, regions [7]. The LSND result is very constraining if\ncorrect, which perhaps accounts for the eagerness to reject it.\n\u2022 Reject the Cl-Ar result or the water-\u010cerenkov solar-neutrino result. These\nexperiments are both primarily sensitive to the 8 B flux. Together they fragment\nthe allowed oscillation parameter space into islands in which shape distortions\nof the 8 B spectrum and neutral-current contributions allow the two results to\nbe reconciled. All of those islands lie at small \u2206m2 . Now, however, with the\nChooz result [13], rejecting one or the other of those measurements no longer\nwould permit a large-\u2206m2 , large-sin2 2\u03b8 solution to the solar-neutrino problem.\n\n6\n\nSterile Neutrinos\n\nHeavy sterile neutrinos are a staple ingredient of most extensions to the Standard\nModel, but light sterile neutrinos have been regarded with distaste. The main reason is that the usual explanation invoked for the lightness of active neutrinos is the\n12\n\n\fTable 4: Experimentally favored neutrino mass differences and mixing angles.\nsin2 2\u03b8\n\nExperiment\n\nFavored Channel\n\n\u2206m2 [ eV2 ]\n\nLSND\nAtmospheric\n\n\u03bd\u0304\u03bc \u2192 \u03bd\u0304e\n\u03bd\u03bc \u2192 \u03bd\u03c4\n\u03bd\u03bc \u2192 \u03bds\n\n0.2\u20132.0\n(1.5\u201340) \u00d7 10\u22123\n3.5 \u00d7 10\u22123\n1\nDisfavored at \u223c 2\u03c3\n\n\u03bde \u2192 \u03bd\u03bc or \u03bd\u03c4\n\u03bde \u2192 anything\n\u03bde \u2192 \u03bd\u03bc or \u03bd\u03c4\n\n(1.3\u201318) \u00d7 10\u22125\n(0.4\u20131) \u00d7 10\u22125\n(0.05\u20135) \u00d7 10\u221210\n\nSolar\nMSW (large angle)\nMSW (small angle)\nVacuum\n\n0.6\u20130.95\n(0.7\u201310) \u00d7 10\u22123\n0.6\u20131\n\nsee-saw mechanism, realized with the aid of a sterile neutrino of GUT-scale mass.\nHaving 'used up' that sterile Majorana neutrino component in producing light active\nneutrinos, one must then invoke complicated new mechanisms to generate and bring\ndown other light sterile neutrinos.\nLight sterile neutrinos are, however, just as natural as light active neutrinos if one\ndoes not start from the see-saw.\nOur experience with the charged fermions is that they are described by the Dirac\nequation, to staggering precision. As the neutrino is a neutral fermion, it would\nbe reasonable to suppose the Dirac equation should apply again. Dirac spinors are\n4-component objects, with two spin states and distinct neutrinos and antineutrinos.\nIn deference to the handedness of the weak interaction, it is useful to project the\nfour components, using the R/L and charge conjugation projection operators:\n\u03c8R/L = 12 (1 \u00b1 \u03b35 )\u03c8\nc\nC\u03c8R/L C\u22121 = \u03c8R/L\nWith 3 active neutrino flavors, mass terms in the Lagrangian have the form\nLm (x) \u223c mD \u03c8\u0304(x)\u03c8(x) \u21d2 MD \u03a8\u0304(x)\u03a8(x)\nwhere mD has been replaced by a nondiagonal 3 \u00d7 3 matrix MD in flavor space and\n\u03c8e\n\uf8ec \u03bc \uf8f7\n\u03a8=\uf8ed \u03c8 \uf8f8\n\u03c8\u03c4\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8f6\n\nMass terms in the Lagrangian must be Lorentz scalars, with no handedness.

If CP is conserved, the four\nmass submatrices are equal [38].\nThe mass matrix is comprised of equal-mass active and sterile neutrinos and their\nantineutrinos, a pair for each generation. This situation is what one would naively\nexpect if neutrinos were exactly like electrons, for example.\nThe upper left and lower right quadrants of this matrix must be zero because the\nleft- and right-handed projectors annihilate each other.

If, however, the Majorana mass terms are small (and so are the\nDirac mass terms, although we do not understand why), then a different but equally\ninteresting phenomenology results. The Majorana mass terms introduce a mixing\nbetween the active and sterile states, viz,\n\u03c8L \u2192 cos \u03b8\u03c8L + sin \u03b8\u03c8Rc .\nSuch terms can be present within a generation and between generations, and lead\nto a complex 6-flavor neutrino mass, mixing, and charge-conjugation map. Gelb and\nRosen [40] have pursued this with a 4-flavor subset of neutrinos (3 active and one\nsterile), and show that not only can the observed mass splittings be reproduced, but\nthe mixing angles are natural.\nIf the positive indications of neutrino oscillation from LSND, from atmospheric\nneutrinos, and from solar neutrinos are all correct, then either the atmosphericneutrino or the solar-neutrino mixing must involve a sterile neutrino. There are two\ncontradictory hints about which solution to choose. The zenith-angle distribution\nfor partially-contained atmospheric neutrinos slightly favors active neutrino mixing.\nOn the other hand, the indications of a possible day-night effect slightly favor the\n14\n\n\fLMA solar solution, which only occurs with active neutrinos. In either case, the mass\nspectrum splits into a pair of doublets with the pair split by the LSND scale (\u2265 0.5\neV) [41] (Fig. 3).\nMass (eV)\nHDM\n\n1\n\n3\u00d7\n\n10\u22123\n\n\u03bd3\n\n\u03bd2\n\u03b4\u039c2 \u223c 10\u22125\n(\u03bd\u03bf. )\n\u03bd0\n\n\u03b4\u039c2 \u223c 10\u22123\n(\u03bdAtmos)\n\u03bd1\n\n\u03b4\u039c2 \u223c 1\n(LSND)\n\nFigure 3: Four-neutrino mass and mixing scheme to accommodate all data [41]. An\ninverted order for the large splitting is also possible.\nEither the standard heirarchical order or the inverted order (solar neutrinos heaviest) are possible, but the sterile partner of the electron neutrino is always the heavier\nin order to have resonant conversion in the sun. Three sterile neutrinos significantly\nmixed with the active ones may create conflicts with the pace of evolution of the\nearly universe as determined from the helium abundance, although one such sterile\nneutrino is probably not ruled out. The same constraint also arises in the 'degenerate' scenario in which the mass splittings are as given by oscillation data, but all\nmasses are shifted up (becoming nearly degenerate in the process). Such a scenario\nis appealing as a source of hot dark matter (HDM), and marginally acceptable in\nnucleosynthesis if only one sterile neutrino species is mixed.\nAn important and perhaps unfortunate consequence of this particular sterile neutrino picture is the suppression of neutrinoless double beta decay. Neutrinos retain\ntheir Dirac nature by and large, with relatively small Majorana components.\nWhile this structure was forced by the need to avoid conflicts between experimental results, it is important to bear in mind that it may be true even if one or more\nexperiment is presently wrong.\n\n15\n\n\f7\n\nDirect Methods \u2013 Tritium and Double Beta Decay\n\nOscillation experiments can never yield a value for the mass because such experiments\nare sensitive only to phase differences that arise from the differences in the squares\nof the masses.\nOnly two methods are presently known that have direct mass sensitivity that is at\nleast roughly in the needed range, single beta decay (of tritium especially) and double\nbeta decay. For many years these difficult experiments have been laboriously pursued,\nbut there was always a worry that one was looking at the \"wrong\" neutrino, because\nthe natural prejudice is to suppose that the \u03bde , \u03bd\u03bc , \u03bd\u03c4 mass heirarchy probably looks\nlike the corresponding charged leptons.\nWith the discovery of oscillations virtually certain now, this picture has completely\nchanged. The small mass differences that are representative of oscillations, and the\nlinks they forge between mass eigenstates, mean that to measure the mass of one\neigenstate is to measure them all. The highly sensitive techniques applicable to the\nelectron neutrino bring all the neutrino masses into the laboratory.\nThere are two tritium beta decay experiments currently in operation, one in\nTroitsk [3], the other in Mainz [4]. Both make use of magnetic-electrostatic retardingfield analyzers. The Troitsk analyzer is connected to a gaseous T2 source, the Mainz\none to a solid frozen T2 source. Steady progress has been made in both laboratories over the years in reducing backgrounds, improving stability and resolution, and\nchecking for systematic effects. The sensitivity of both instruments is now in the\nrange of 2 eV.\nInitially both experiments reported large negative values of the parameter m2 .\nThis parameter, when positive, represents the weighted average of the square of the\nneutrino mass,\nX\n|Uei |2 m2i\nm2 =\ni\n\nbut when negative serves as an effective parameter to continue the functional form\nof the beta spectrum into the non-physical regime (more events near the endpoint\ninstead of fewer) to allow for statistical fluctuations. In fact, all recent tritium experiments have reported m2 < 0, in some cases well beyond the level expected from\nstatistical fluctuations, indicative perhaps of systematic effects. The main effect seen\nin the Troitsk experiment was traced to electrons trapped in the source region and\nescaping to the spectrometer only after having suffered energy loss. In the Mainz experiment the main effect was a morphological change in the structure of the tritium\nfilm, which increased the energy loss.\n\n16\n\n\fOnce those problems were eliminated, a curious 'step' remained in much of the\nTroitsk data near the endpoint. (The spectrometer being an integral device, a step\nwould correspond to a spike in the differential spectrum.) This step varied in intensity\nand position from run to run. In Fig. 4 the position of the step (which was always\nbelow the endpoint) and the intensity are shown. The position appeared to show a\nperiodic motion with a period of 0.50 years. The last point, 98.3 is a run taken to\ntest the prediction from the set of earlier data; it cannot be said either to agree or to\ndisagree strongly with it.\nIn extracting a limit on the mass, the Troitsk group includes a step function in\nthe fit. That is done consistently for all runs, with the step amplitude and position\nbeing fit parameters for each run. Unfortunately, this means that approximately half\nof the runs must be discarded since the step does not show up clearly in them and\nbecomes excessively covariant with other fit parameters. When the step is fit, there\nremains no (other) non-standard contribution,\nm2\u03bd = \u22122.0 \u00b1 3.5 \u00b1 2.1 eV2\nand a 95%-CL upper limit (Feldman-Cousins) on the neutrino mass is set at 2.5 eV.\nFitting data without the step results in \u221215 \u2264 m2\u03bd \u2264 \u221212 eV2 , unless the fit is\nrestricted to the last 70 eV of the spectrum, in which case m2\u03bd = 5 \u00b1 5 eV2 .\nWith a series of substantial technical improvements to their apparatus, the Mainz\ngroup succeeding in increasing the signal-to-background ratio tenfold and are able to\ntake data at a sensitivity competitive with the Troitsk instrument. Out of 4 runs\ntaken in 1997-8, one shows a step 12 eV from the endpoint at the same time as the\nTroitsk group measured one (shown as \"98.2\"in Fig. 4). At other times, 97.1, 98.1,\nand 98.3, no step was seen. The Mainz data fit without a step gives negative values\nfor m2\u03bd very similar to the Troitsk ones (\u221215 \u2264 m2\u03bd \u2264 \u221212 eV2 ), but a different\nprescription for negative m2\u03bd is used, so direct comparison is not possible. When the\nfit is restricted to the last 15 eV of the spectrum,\nm2\u03bd = \u22120.1 \u00b1 3.8 \u00b1 1.8 eV2\nand a 95%-CL upper limit (Feldman-Cousins) on the neutrino mass is set at 2.9 eV.\nFor positive ions, the spectrometers are Penning traps (in which charged particles\ncan be confined by axial magnetic fields and electrostatic potentials) and the Mainz\ngroup has begun to explore the possibility that a significant density of ions may\naccumulate in them. A cloud of such ions would show no kinetic gas pressure but\ncould nevertheless cause inelastic collisions of the electrons being analyzed. One run\nhas been carried out in which an oscillatory clearing electric field was applied at\nintervals to eject such ions, and in that run no negative m2\u03bd effect was seen. This is\npromising, but clearly a preliminary result. It must be remembered that the negative\nm2\u03bd effect was seen in the Mainz data without a step being present, and so they may\nnot be the same phenomenon.\n17\n\n\fFigure 4: The step observed in the Troitsk integral tritium beta spectrum; top \u2013\nposition from endpoint; bottom \u2013 intensity. [3]\n\n18\n\n\fIf a step really is present in the integral spectrum, it is a very exciting development.\nCapture of relic neutrinos produces a spike in the beta spectrum, because the decay\nenergy is transferred entirely to the electron. There are no good laboratory limits on\nthe local density of neutrinos near the earth \u2013 perhaps this is an indication that it is\nvery large, of order 1015 cm\u22123 . Stephenson et al. [42] present a model in which such\na density can arise, and which appears not to conflict with any known facts.\nIf on the other hand, the step turns out to be instrumental and removable, it is\nalready clear that the present generation of instruments has the capability of reaching\na limit in the range of 1-2 eV, a remarkable achievement. Plans are afoot in both\ngroups for next-generation devices that will attack the 1-eV level.\nMany nuclei provide an opportunity to search for neutrinoless double beta decay;\nsingle beta decay is blocked by energy conservation. Because large high-resolution\ndetectors can be made from Ge (enriched in 76 Ge), the current best limit comes from\nthe Heidelberg-Moscow collaboration [43, 8]:\naj\n< mM\n>=\n\u03bd\n\nX\n\n\u03bbm |Uem |2 mm \u2264 0.4eV2\n\nm\n\nwhere m is an index summing over Majorana mass terms only and \u03bbm is the CP\nphase.\n\n8\n\nThe Future\n\nWith neutrino oscillations, and therefore mass, becoming more firmly established,\nthe task of the experimentalist is clearer than at any time in the past \u2013 not necessarily easier, but clearer. No longer does the parameter ocean extend logarithmically\nto the horizon in every direction, but instead well-defined islands call out for close\nexploration.\nTable 5, inspired by a similar approach in Fisher et al. [8], sets forth a list of\nkey experiments and the implications of possible results of those experiments. The\nquestions to be sorted out first include, what neutrino species are involved in the\natmospheric and solar oscillation channels, can the LSND result be confirmed, what\nmixing parameters are responsible for the solar neutrino effects, and what is the\nmagnitude of the mass itself? Answers to these questions will be hard-won but they\nseem within reach. Even more difficult and subtle issues are the charge-conjugation\nproperties of neutrinos and their transformation under CP. The next decade will be\nan exciting time in neutrino physics.\nInformation and help generously given by John Beacom, Wick Haxton, Boris\nKayser, Vladimir Lobashev, Ernst Otten, and Peter Rosen are most gratefully acknowledged.\n19\n\n\fTable 5: Future neutrino program and possible outcomes.\nFuture\nObservation\n\u223c 1 eV mass in\ntritium decay\n\u2192 HDM\n0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2\n\u2192 HDM\nSNO NC/CC = 3\nSNO NC/CC = 1\nDeep Borexino\n7\nBe deficit, < NC\nBorexino\nyearly signal\nA pp solar \u03bd\nexperiment,\nCC only\nKamLAND \u03bd e\ndisappearance\nResults from\nK2K, MINOS,\nCERN\nResults from\nBoone, MINOS\n\nSolar \u03bd\nOscillation\nA near-degenerate\npartner\n\nAtmospheric \u03bd\nLSND \u03bd\nOscillation\nOscillation\n2\n\u2206m yields masses of\nthree eigenstates\n\nMajorana neutrinos,\nlikely see-saw\nActive Flavor\nmixing\nSterile\nSterile, Small-angle,\nMatter-enhanced\nVacuum Oscillations\nDefine \u2206m2 , sin2 2\u03b8,\nNC/CC with\nBorexino\nLarge angle,\nactive\n\nOne must be sterile = conflict?\nActive OK\n\nOne must be sterile = conflict?\nMeasure \u03bd\u03bc \u2192 \u03bd\u03c4\n\nConfirm LSND,\nmeasure \u03bde \u2194 \u03bd\u03bc\n\nReferences\n[1] T.
