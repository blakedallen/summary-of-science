Schr\u00f6dinger's equation does this for isolated quantum systems.\nDescribing the time evolution of a quantum system that interacts with its\nenvironment, in its most general form, has proved to be difficult because\nthe dynamics is dependent on the state of the environment and the correlations with it. For discrete processes, such as quantum gates or chemical\nreactions, quantum process tomography provides the complete description of the dynamics, provided that the initial states of the system and\nthe environment are independent of each other. However, many physical\nsystems are correlated with the environment at the beginning of the experiment. Here, we give a prescription of quantum process tomography\nthat yields the complete description of the dynamics of the system even\nwhen the initial correlations are present. Surprisingly, our method also\ngives quantitative expressions for the initial correlation.\n\nThere is a rich history to the studies of decoherence of quantum systems due\nto the interactions with the surrounding degrees of freedom. When the dynamics\nof the system (S) is Markovian it can be described by a master equation [1, 2, 3].\nNowadays many researchers are interested in systems that are non-Markovian,\nas there is mounting evidence that some natural systems of importance may\nbe non-Markovian [4] and such features may allow to manipulate and control\nquantum systems in desired ways. There is also a great deal of interest in\nsystems that are initially correlated with their environments (E) because nonMarkovianity and initial system-environment (SE) correlations are intimately\nrelated [5, 6, 7].\n\n1\n\n\fGrasping the mathematical and physical aspects of non-Markovian systems,\nespecially with initial SE correlations, has proved to be a tough road. Nevertheless, there is a great deal of progress on deciding whether a system is\nnon-Markovian in the recent years [8, 7, 9, 10, 11]. However, avoiding the initial\nSE correlations is not always possible in reality [12, 13, 14]. Working with initial\ncorrelations in practice has proved to be much trickier than in theory. This is\nbecause the presence of correlations do not allow for a clear definition of the\nstate S independent from the state of E and vice versa. Physical systems are\ncomplicated and have many additional degrees of freedom that are not of experimental interest. Yet these extra degrees of freedom interact with the degrees\nof interest leading to correlations. Therefore initially uncorrelated SE state is\noften an approximation.\nIn theory of open quantum systems, discrete quantum transformations are\ndescribed by the dynamical map formalism [15, 16]: B(\u03c1S ) = \u03c1St . The dynamical\nmap can be thought of as coming from the contraction of SE unitary dynamics.\nLet us write the state of SE as\n\u03c1SE = \u03c1S \u2297 \u03c1E + \u03c7SE ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03c7SE is the correlations matrix [17]. The dynamical map is the mapping from the initial states of S to the final states of S, resulting from unitary\ndynamics of the SE state\n\u0002\n\u0003\nB(\u03c1S ) = \u03c1St = trE U \u03c1SE U \u2020\n(2)\n\u0002 S\n\u0003\n\u0002 SE \u2020 \u0003\nE \u2020\n= trE U \u03c1 \u2297 \u03c1 U + trE U \u03c7 U\n(3)\n=\n\nB CP (\u03c1S ) + B aff ,\n\n(4)\n\nwhere B CP is a completely positive map and B aff is the affine correction term due\nto the initial SE correlations. This means that B may not a be completely positive map when \u03c7SE 6= 0, nevertheless it fully describes the dynamics of S [19].\nHowever, to determine such a map experimentally would require preparing different states of S while keeping the SE correlations fixed. Such preparations are\nnot operationally feasible because altering the state of S will also alter the SE\ncorrelations. Therefore, a nonpositive dynamical map is not an operationally\nmeaningful quantity.\nThe operational approach to quantum dynamics relies on the fact that quantum theory is a theory of preparations and measurements. The experimental\nmethod to determine a dynamical map corresponding to a quantum process is\ncalled quantum process tomography (QPT) [20, 21]. It is the central tool in\ndetermining a discrete quantum process; e.g. quantum gates [22, 23, 24, 25, 26,\n27, 28, 29, 30] or chemical reactions [31, 32, 33]. To see the difference between\nQPT and dynamical maps let us review the four basic steps necessary to carried\nout QPT [34, 35]:\n(i) Input states that span the space of S are prepared.\n(ii) The input states are sent through the process.\n2\n\n\fFigure 1: Standard\nquantum process tomography. At the beginning of the experiment the systemenvironment state is uncorrelated. A preparation (A) is made on the system\nand the corresponding output state Q is observed. This process is described by\nthe completely positive map of Eq. (4), which is a function of initial state of\nenvironment and the unitary dynamics. It maps the initial states of the system\nto output states Q.\n(iii) The corresponding output states are determined by quantum state tomography.\n(iv) The knowledge of input states, the corresponding output states, and assuming linearity completely determines the process.\nLet us denote input states as P and output states as Q. The first step of\nQPT is state preparation. A preparation procedure takes an unknown state of S\nto a known state of S. Mathematically, it is described by a completely positive\nmap acting on the system [36]. For instance, \u0001consider a set of preparations that\nproject S into pure states: [A(m) \u2297 I] \u03c1SE = P (m) \u2297 \u03c1E|(m) . Since P (m) is\na pure state, the post-preparation SE state is fully uncorrelated, where \u03c1E|(m)\nis the conditional state of E. I is the identity operator acting on E, as we\nassume that the preparation procedure only acts on S and not E. We will\ndiscuss the implications of relaxing this assumption in Discussions.\nLastly,\n\u0002\n\u0003 if\nthe preparation is not trace preserving, it should be divided tr A(m) (\u03c1SE ) for\nnormalisation.\nThe SE evolution, after the preparation yields the output state:\nh\ni\nQ(m) = trE U [A(m) \u2297 I](\u03c1SE )U \u2020\n(5)\nh\ni\n= trE U P (m) \u2297 \u03c1E|(m) U \u2020 .\n(6)\nThe key difference between the dynamical map in Eqs. (2) and (5) is the act of\nstate preparation. Because dynamical maps of do accommodate state preparation, they are not operationally defined. In the presence of initial SE correlations, state preparation affects the state of E in a nontrivial manner. That is,\nthe state of E in Eq. (6) is conditioned by the choice of the preparations.\n\n3\n\n\fIn deriving the standard QPT procedure it is implicitly assumed that the\ninitial state of SE is uncorrelated [37], i.e., the state of E is thought to be a\nconstant of the problem. When that is the case, the state of E in Eq. (6) is\nnot conditioned by the preparation procedure. In this case the derived map for\nthe process is completely positive and is the same as the completely positive\ndynamical map in Eq. (4). See Fig. 1 for a graphical illustration. In the\npresence on initial SE correlation, the conditional state of E will be different\nfor each preparation, and the assumption of linearity in step (iv) of QPT is\nviolated, i.e. the map is a function of the preparation procedure. Such maps\nare nonpositive, nonlinear, or simply put nonsensical [34, 35].\nIt then begs the question, can we determine the dynamics of a system that is\ninitially correlated with E? This is an important question for two reasons: First,\nthere may be physical system of interest that may have initial correlations. Is it\npossible to study their dynamics? Second, for foundational reasons we may care\nto know what are the limitations in describing the dynamics of physical systems.\nA partial solution to these questions was given in [34, 38]. In this article we\nshow that not only complete dynamics of initially correlated system can be\ndetermined, we can also determine the contribution due to initial correlations.\n\nResults\nA map on a map\nQPT is performed out by noting how input states, that span the space of S,\nmap to output states. The key insight in what follows is that it is not the input\nstates of S that are relevant, rather it is the preparation procedures itself, i.e.,\nthe preparation map A. For a dS dimensional system there are d2S linearly independent states that span its space. However, there are d4S linearly independent\noperations (preparations) that span the space of preparations. If we determine\nthe corresponding output states for a set of linearly independent preparations\nthen by linearity we have can predict the output state for any preparation. Let\nus denote this map as M-map.\nThe form of M-map arises naturally when considering the whole process\nin physical terms: At the beginning of the experiment SE is in an unknown\n(correlated) state, \u03c1SE . The system is prepared into a known input state by the\npreparation procedure A, followed by a joint unitary dynamics. The output is\ngiven by tracing over the environmental degrees of freedom:\n\u0002\n\u0001 \u0003\nQ = trE U [A \u2297 I] \u03c1SE U \u2020 .\n(7)\nWe want a map acting on the preparation map A and yielding the output state\nQ: M (A) \u2192 Q. Then M-map is everything on the right hand side of Eq. (7)\nthat is not A. The expression for M-map in terms of matrix indices is\n\u2217\nMrr0 r00 ;ss0 s00 = Ur\u000f,r0 \u03b1 \u03c1SE\nr 00 \u03b1,s00 \u03b2 Us\u000f,s0 \u03b2 .\n\n4\n\n(8)\n\n\fFigure 2: Quantum\nprocess tomography with M-map. At the beginning of the experiment the\nsystem-environment state is correlated. A preparation is made on the system\nand the corresponding output state Q is observed. This process is described\nby the completely positive map M, which is a function of the initial systemenvironment state and the unitary dynamics. The M-map takes preparations\nA to output states Q.\nAbove a sum over repeated indices is implied. M-map is a 'super super-operator'\nthat acts on the super operator A. M-map is a d3S \u00d7 d3S tensor, which is\ncontracted with a preparation A, a d2S \u00d7 d2S tensor, yielding the output state Q,\na dS \u00d7 dS matrix. In term of matrix indices, the action is as follows:\nQrs = Mrr0 r00 ;ss0 s00 (Ar0 r00 ;s0 s00 ).\n\n(9)\n\nAgain, a sum over repeated indices is implied. In Methods, a full derivation for\nM-map in the last equation is given. See Fig. 2 for a graphical illustration of\nM-map.\nNote that, in standard quantum process tomography state of E is a constant\nof the process, here it is the initial SE state that is the constant of the process,\ni.e., it is a fixed quantity. Physically, the constancy of \u03c1SE means that the\nexperiment should be initialised in the same manner for every run, and then a\npreparation on S can be made.\nM-map contains both U and \u03c1SE ; however knowing M is not sufficient to\ndetermine U and \u03c1SE . As expected, it should not be possible to determine U\nand \u03c1SE through measurements and preparations on the system alone without access to the environment. Conversely, M-map contains all information\nnecessary to fully determine the output state for any preparation of S. The advantage of dealing with the M-map is that we have separated the preparation\nprocedure from uncontrollable dynamical elements and the initial conditions.\nM-map contains all of the dynamical information for the system and in the\nnext section we will extract some of this information from the M-map. First\nlet us mention some properties of M-map derived in Methods: Its action on\na mixture of preparations is linear, it preserves trace, it preserves Hermiticity,\nand it is completely positive.\nIn Methods we show that M\u2212map can be experimentally determined by\nmaking a set of linearly independent preparation of the system. This is similar\n5\n\n\fto what one has to do in standard QPT. In standard QPT a linearly independent set of states are fed into the process and the corresponding outcomes are\nobserved. Knowing the inputs and the outputs the standard process map is determined. The difference here is that a linearly independent set of preparations\nare fed in to the process. This is of our major result of this paper: We have\ngiven a prescription to determine the dynamics of a system in an operational\nway, i.e., a mapping from preparations to output states.\n\nQuantifying initial correlations\nThe M-map contains the dynamics of the system before any preparation is made\non the system. It is a function of the initial state \u03c1SE state as well as the SE\nunitary transformation. M-map is a tensor, taking its trace with respect to the\nindices that belong to the initial state of S we can obtain the dynamics of the\nsystem as if the initial correlations we absent. Using this with the knowledge of\nthe initial state of S, in Methods we show that from M we can derive another\nmatrix,\nX\n\u2217\nLrr0 r00 ;ss0 s00 =\nUr\u000f,r0 \u03b1 \u03c1Sr00 s00 \u03c1E\u03b1\u03b2 Us\u000f,s\n(10)\n0\u03b2 .\n\u03b1\u03b2\u000f\n\nMatrix L is fully determinable from M\u2212map and the two are the same when\nthere are no initial correlations. We will call the difference between M and L,\nK = M \u2212 L, the memory matrix :\nX\n\u2217\nKrr0 r00 ;ss0 s00 =\nUr\u000f,r0 \u03b1 \u03c7SE\n(11)\nr 00 \u03b1;s00 \u03b2 Us\u000f,s0 \u03b2 .\n\u03b1\u03b2\u000f\n\nSince M contains \u03c1SE and L contains \u03c1S \u2297 \u03c1E , the difference between the two\nis a function of only \u03c7SE . The action of the correlation-memory matrix on a\npreparation yields\n\u03c7SA (t) = K(A) = trE [U [A \u2297 I](\u03c7SE )U \u2020 ],\n\n(12)\n\nwhich is the coherence coming into the system from the initial correlations.\nFor non-Markovian dynamics the future state of S may depend on the initial\nSE correlations. This is the non-Markovian 'memory' due to the initial SE\ncorrelations and it is a key feature of non-Markovian dynamics [7].\nThe correlation-memory matrix is an important result for studying nonMarkovian systems. It is an operational way of measuring the information that\nflows into S due to correlations at the time of the preparation. Once M\u2212map\nis determined, we have the full knowledge of the dynamics of S that is due to\nthe initial correlations. The correlation-memory matrix provides quantitative\ninformation about the initial correlation and it is more than a witness for initial\ncorrelations [12].\n\n6\n\n\fOperational meaning of not-completely positive maps\nFor the special case, when the preparation is chosen to be the identity map, we\nget pure dynamics of the correlation-memory matrix\nK(I) = trE [U \u03c7SE U \u2020 ],\n\n(13)\n\nwhich is the reduced dynamics of SE correlations. This is exactly B aff in Eq. 4.\nFrom M-map we can determine matrices L and K. In turn, from L we can get\nB CP (see Eq. (28)) and from K we can get B aff , and together they give us B of\nEq. (2), which can be a not-completely positive map. This gives not-completely\npositive maps an operational meaning.\n\nDiscussion\nM-map is the result of a quantum process tomography procedure for initially\ncorrelated system-environment states. It is acts on the preparation of the initial state of the system, and only contains dynamical information. We study\nthe properties of M-map, showing it to be linear, preserving of trace and Hermiticity, and completely positive. Dynamical information about the evolution\nof the initial correlations can be retrieved from M\u2212map, in the form of the\ncorrelation-memory matrix K. M-map allows us to determine the output state\nfor any preparation of the system, while the correlation-memory matrix K provides a quantitative expression for the coherence due to the initial correlations.\nAn important question is when is M-map relevant? Clearly, when S and E\nare initially uncorrelated then K will be zero. Alternatively, just the presence\nof initial SE correlations does not warrant for M-map. Suppose \u03c7SE 6= 0 but\ntrE [U \u03c7SE U \u2020 ] = 0, then the completely positive map of Eq. (4) would suffice to\ndescribe the dynamics correctly for any preparation of S [18].\nOne downside to M\u2212map is that it requires a lot of resources to construct.\nIn standard quantum process tomography d2S input states are fed through the\nprocess and the corresponding output states are determined. To determine\nM map, d4S preparations are necessary, which is a significant growth over the\nstandard procedure. Therefore an efficient way, such as compressed sensing [39,\n40], to determine this map is desirable. This should be possible, as determining\nM-map is equivalent to carrying out dS standard quantum process tomography\nprocedures.\nAnother limitation that faces the procedure is the assumption that the preparation acts only on the system and not on the environment. This assumption\nis crucial, as we are mapping from the set of preparations on the system to the\ncorresponding output states. If this assumption fails, then we would need to\nmake a set of preparations that span the space of operations on the combined\nsystem-environment space. However, the environment can be arbitrarily large\nand we do not have any control over it. Therefore the tools given in this article\nmay not be valid when the preparation affects the environment directly. When\nthe preparation procedure acts on E as well as S, the positivity of M-map may\n7\n\n\fbe affected. Note that, as long the effect of all preparations on E is a constant\nfor then our prescription remains valid.\nLastly, since M-map contains all dynamical information, we are able to\nconstruct B CP of Eq. (4) from it. Similarly, from the correlation-memory matrix,\nwe can construct B aff of Eq. (4). Knowing the two we can determine B of\nEq. (2), which can be a not-completely positive map. This gives operational\nmeaning to not-completely positive dynamical map as the descriptor for the\ndynamics of the system when identity preparation is made. On the other hand,\nthe non-completely positive map is not experimentally determinable without\ndetermining M-map. Finally, it remains an open question, when K > 0, is B\nnot completely positive?\n\nMethods\nThe calculations in this sections are done in terms of matrix indices as Mmap and the correlation-memory matrix K are nontrivial tensors. We use the\nEinstein summation notation, i.e., repeated indices are summed over. Bipartite\nstate of SE is expressed with four indices with the Latin indices belong to\nS and greek indices to E. For instance, the state in Eq. (1) has the form\nS\nE\nSE\n\u03c1SE\nr\u03b1,s\u03b2 = \u03c1rs \u2297 \u03c1\u03b1\u03b2 + \u03c7r\u03b1,s\u03b2 . A map acting on a density matrix is written\n\u0001\n\u2217\nS\nk\nas Arr0 ;ss0 \u03c1r0 s0 = Arr0 \u03c1Sr0 s0 Ak ss0 = Prs , where Ak are the Sudarshan-Kraus\n\u2217\noperators (see [15]). A is the complex conjugation of A and Ars \u2192 Asr is the\ntranspose; together they give Hermitian conjugation.\n\nM\u2212map\nLet us rewrite the generalised process equation, Eq. (7), in terms of matrix\nindices\n\u0001 \u2217\nQrs = Ur\u000f;r0 \u03b1 Ar0 r00 ;s0 s00 \u03c1SE\n(14)\nr 00 \u03b1;s00 \u03b2 Us\u000f;s0 \u03b2 ,\nwhere the sum over \u000f is the trace with respect to the environment. We are interested in the reduced dynamics of S as a function of the preparation procedures.\nThus, we can pull the preparation map out of everything else and regard it all\nas a map acting on the preparation map:\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u2217\nQrs = Ur\u000f;r0 \u03b1 \u03c1SE\nr 00 \u03b1;s00 \u03b2 Us\u000f;s0 \u03b2 (Ar 0 r 00 ;s0 s00 )\n= Mrr0 r00 ;ss0 s00 (Ar0 r00 ;s0 s00 ) .\n\n(15)\n\nIn the last equation, the matrix M is defined as:\n\u2217\nMrr0 r00 ;ss0 s00 = Ur\u000f,r0 \u03b1 \u03c1SE\nr 00 \u03b1,s00 \u03b2 Us\u000f,s0 \u03b2 .\n\n(16)\n\nDetermining M\u2212map\nLet {P (m) = |\u03c0 (m) i h\u03c0 (m) |} be a set of pure states that linearly span the space\nof S. There are d2S such matrices. That\nP is, any state of S can be written as a\nlinear sum of these pure states: \u03c1S = m rm P (m) .\n8\n\n\fA preparation map acting on S is a d2S \u00d7d2S Hermitian matrix. Therefore, any\nmatrix in this space can be spanned by a tensor product of the basis matrices\n{P (m) \u2297 P (n) }, which is a basis in for d2S \u00d7 d2S space of maps. There are d4S\nelements in the basis {P (m) \u2297 P (n) }. We can write action of one of these basis\nelement on a density operator on S as\nA(mn) (\u03c1SE ) = |\u03c0 (n) i h\u03c0 (m) |\u03c1SE |\u03c0 (m) i h\u03c0 (n) | .\n\n(17)\n\nIt is crucial to note here that h\u03c0 (m) |\u03c0 (n) i =\n6 \u03b4mn , as these vectors are eigenvectors\nof the basis elements {P (m) } that do not commute.\nThese preparations are can be thought of as a projection followed by a\nrotation. Action of any map on space of S acting on the SE state can be\nexpresses as a linear sum\nX\nA(\u03c1SE ) =\n\u03b1(mn) A(mn)\n(18)\nmn\n\n=\n\nX\n\n\u03b1(mn) |\u03c0 (n) i h\u03c0 (m) |\u03c1SE |\u03c0 (m) i h\u03c0 (n) |\n\n(19)\n\nh\ni\n\u03b1(mn) P (n) \u2297 trS \u03c1SE P (m)\n\n(20)\n\n\u03b1(mn) p(m) P (n) \u2297 \u03c1E|(m) ,\n\n(21)\n\nmn\n\n=\n\nX\nmn\n\n=\n\nX\nmn\n\nwhere \u03b1(mn) are the coefficients that determine A in terms of {A(mn) }. \u03c1E|(m)\nis the conditional state of the E and p(m) = tr[P (m) \u03c1S ] is the probability for the\noutcome P (m) .\nKnowing the output states corresponding to each of these inputs,\nQ(mn) = trE [U P (n) \u2297 \u03c1E|(m) U \u2020 ],\n\n(22)\n\nalong with the success probabilities p(m) , for all m, n, is enough to predict the\noutput state for any preparation:\ntrE [U A(\u03c1SE )U \u2020 ]\nX\n\u03b1(mn) p(m) trE [U P (n) \u2297 \u03c1E|(m) U \u2020 ]\n=\n\nQ =\n\n(23)\n(24)\n\nmn\n\n=\n\nX\n\n\u03b1(mn) p(m) Q(mn) .\n\n(25)\n\nmn\n\nM-map can be determined choosing A(mn) , followed determining the corresponding Q(mn) and p(m) , and standard inversion techniques [37]. Note that\nany other set of linearly independent preparation can be linearly mapped to the\npreparations given in Eq. (17), and therefore will suffice.\nDetermining all Q(mn) is done by quantum state tomography. This is equivalent to carrying out dS standard QPT procedures, one each \u03c1E|(m) . Additionally\nmeasuring p(m) is equivalent to doing quantum state tomography of \u03c1S .\n9\n\n\fBefore moving on a simple example may be useful. For one qubit, we may\ntake the following projectors as a linearly independent basis:\n1\n1\n1\n1\nP (1) = (I + \u03c31 ), P (2) = (I + \u03c32 ), P (3) = (I + \u03c33 ), P (4) = (I \u2212 \u03c31 ).\n2\n2\n2\n2\nNote that, this is a linear but not a convex decomposition: P (5) = 21 (I + \u03c32 ) =\nP (1) + P (4) \u2212 P (2) . The eigenvectors of P (1) , P (2) , P (3) , and P (4) are |x+i =\n\u221a1 (|0i + |1i), |y+i = \u221a1 (|0i + i |1i), |z+i = |0i, and |x\u2212i = \u221a1 (|0i \u2212 |1i)\n2\n2\n2\nrespectively. Using these eigenvectors we can write basis elements for the maps\nthat operate on the space of one qubit. For instance,\nA(1,1) (\u03c1SE ) = |x+i hx+| \u03c1SE |x+i hx+| = p(x+) |x+i hx+| \u2297 \u03c1E|(x+) ,\nA(3,4) (\u03c1SE ) = |x\u2212i hz+| \u03c1SE |z+i hx\u2212| = p(z+) |x\u2212i hx\u2212| \u2297 \u03c1E|(z+) ,\nA(4,2) (\u03c1SE ) = |y+i hx\u2212| \u03c1SE |x\u2212i hy+| = p(x\u2212) |y+i hy+| \u2297 \u03c1E|(x\u2212) ,\nand so on.\n\nDetecting initial correlations\nThe initial state of the system is labeled by indices r00 and s00 . Tracing over\neverything else we can find the initial state of S (before preparation) from Mmap:\n1\n\u03b4rs \u03b4r0 s0 Mrr0 r00 ;ss0 s00 = \u03c1Sr00 s00 .\n(26)\ndS\nThis is, of course, attainable by doing state tomography at the beginning of the\nexperiment, by measuring the values of p(m) from last section.\nNext, let us the trace over the system indices r00 and s00\n\u2217\nCP\n\u03b4r00 s00 Mrr0 r00 ;ss0 s00 = Ur\u000f,r0 \u03b1 \u03c1E\u03b1\u03b2 Us\u000f,s\n0 \u03b2 = Brr 0 ;ss0 .\n\n(27)\n\nThe last equation is exactly the dynamical map in the absence of initial correlations, given in Eq. (4). In other words, in the absence of initial correlations,\nQPT would yield this map.\nThis means, even though the M-map contains the information about uncorrelated SE state and the correlations separately. Consider the following matrix\ncomposed of the matrices in Eqs. (26) and (27)\nLrr0 r00 ;ss0 s00\n\n=\n\nCP\nS\nBrr\n0 ;ss0 \u03c1r 00 s00\n\n=\n\n\u2217\nUr\u000f,r0 \u03b1 \u03c1Sr00 s00 \u03c1E\u03b1\u03b2 Us\u000f,s\n0\u03b2 .\n\n(28)\n\nThe last equation is similar to the expression for the M-map, except the state\nof the system and the state of the environment are uncorrelated.\nWriting the state of SE in M-map in terms of Eq. (1), we get\n(rs)\n\n\u2217\nMr0 r00 ;s0 s00 = Ur\u000f,r0 \u03b1 (\u03c1Sr00 s00 \u03c1E\u03b1\u03b2 + \u03c7SE\nr 00 \u03b1;s00 \u03b2 )Us\u000f,s0 \u03b2 .\n\n(29)\n\nNow we can define the correlation-memory matrix as\nKrr0 r00 ;ss0 s00\n\n=\n\nMrr0 r00 ;ss0 s00 \u2212 Lrr0 r00 ;ss0 s00\n\n(30)\n\n=\n\n\u2217\nUr\u000f,r0 \u03b1 \u03c7SE\nr 00 \u03b1;s00 \u03b2 Us\u000f,s0 \u03b2 .\n\n(31)\n\n10\n\n\fProperties of M\nLinearity\nMathematically, M\u2212map acts on the preparation map just as the dynamical\nmap acts on a density operator. In fact, we are not varying the initial state\nof the system, rather the preparation procedure on that state. Therefore the\nlinearity of quantum mechanics is preserved for the M-map acting on different\npreparation procedures, i.e.\ni\nh\n(32)\nM \u03b11 A(1) + \u03b12 A(2) = \u03b11 MA(1) + \u03b12 MA(2) .\nThis is very much like the dynamical maps action on mixtures of states. Furthermore, if we show that the M\u2212map preserves trace, Hermiticity, and positivity\non its domain then all of these properties will be preserved on the state space.\nIn other words for any preparation, A(m) that preserves trace, Hermiticity, and\npositivity, the action of the M\u2212map on it will yield an output state, Q(m) , that\nis unit-trace, Hermitian and positive.\nTrace preservation\nLet us start with the trace of M with respect to the final indices r with s:\ntr(rs) [M]\n\nSince U \u2020 U =\n\nP\n\nr\u000f\n\n=\n\n\u03b4rs Mrr0 r00 ;ss0 s00\n\n=\n\n\u2217\nUr\u000f,r0 \u03b1 \u03c1SE\nr 00 \u03b1,s00 \u03b2 Ur\u000f,s0 \u03b2 .\n\n(33)\n\n\u2217\nUr\u000f,s\n0 \u03b2 Ur\u000f,r 0 \u03b1 = I, then\nS\ntr(rs) [M] = \u03b4r0 s0 \u03b4\u03b1\u03b2 \u03c1SE\nr 00 \u03b1,s00 \u03b2 = I \u2297 \u03c1 .\n\n(34)\n\nA preparation acting on the above matrix will yield\ntr(rs) [M](A) = tr[A(\u03c1S )] = 1.\n\n(35)\n\nThe implication being M preserves the trace of A(\u03c1S ). As long as the preparation is trace a preserving operation we get a unit-trace matrix for the output\nstate.\nHermiticity preservation\nAs with the case of general quantum operations, matrix M is Hermitian. This\nis easy to see by taking the complex conjugate of matrix M,\nX\n\u2217\n\u2217\n(Mrr0 r00 ;ss0 s00 ) =\nUs\u000f,s0 \u03b2 \u03c1SE\ns00 \u03b2,r 00 \u03b1 Ur\u000f,r 0 \u03b1,\n\u03b1\u03b2\u000f\n\n= Mss0 s00 ;rr00 r0 .\n\n(36)\n\nThe complex conjugate of M is not only the transpose of M, but each element\nof M is also transposed. Hence M is a Hermitian matrix.\n11\n\n\fPositivity of M-map\nThe M-map is composed of a unitary matrix operating on a density matrix.\nThen we can take the square root of the density matrix to get\np\np\n\u2217\nMrr0 r00 ;ss0 s00 = Ur\u000f,r0 \u03b1 \u03c1SE r00 \u03b1,\u03c3\u03b3 \u03c1SE \u03c3\u03b3,s00 \u03b2 Us\u000f,s\n0\u03b2\n=\n\n\u2217\n\n\u03bc\n\u03bc\nMr;r\n0 r 00 Ms0 s00 ;s ,\n\n(37)\n\np\nwhere M = U \u03c1SE and \u03bc = \u03c3\u03b3\u000f. We have written the M-map in operator sum\nrepresentation, hence it is completely positive. Where M \u03bc are the SudarshanKraus operators [15, 16]. This means, the M-map acting on any preparation\nprocedure will lead to a physical state. This was not the case when a standard\nQPT procedure is carried out on initially correlated SE states. The action of\nM-map can now be written as\nX\n\u2020\nM(A) =\nM \u03bcA M \u03bc .\n(38)\n\u03bc\n\nThe properties shown above are precisely the conditions for a generic quantum operation to preserve trace, Hermiticity and positivity. Therefore M\u2212map\npreserves the attributes on the preparations, which in return will preserve these\nattributes on the states.\n\nReferences\n[1] Kossakowski, A.
