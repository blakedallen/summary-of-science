It is accepted that the best neutron source to perform such measurements is the\nRussian pulsed YAGUAR reactor. Some preliminary measurements and numerical simulations\nfor expected experimental geometry had been performed [2]. We want to show here an analytical\napproach to calculations. First we obtain analytical momentum spectrum of scattered neutrons,\nthen the time of flight spectrum of neutrons detected by a single counter. After that we consider\ncoincidence scheme where we have two detectors, and calculate time of flight spectrum for one\ndetector and delay time spectrum for the second one. We considered coincidence scheme because\nfrom the very beginning of discussions about the project, and all the time during preparation of\nthe experiment, many people continue to express the opinion that the coincidence scheme has\nan advantage comparing to the single detector measurement. They claim that loss of intensity,\nwhich they usually estimated at the level of 20%, will be surpassed by much higher suppression\nof background. We show here analytically that in the coincidence scheme effect is so much\nsuppressed, that the question about the background level becomes irrelevant.\n\n2\n\nEstimation of the effect\n\nThe scheme of the experiment is presented in Fig. 1 borrowed from [1]. The YAGUAR reactor\n1 gives a pulse of length tp = 0.68 ms, during which a huge amount of neutrons with flux density\n\u03a6 = 0.77 \u00d7 1018 n/cm2 s is released. After a moderator at room temperature T neutrons in the\nthermal Maxwellian spectrum arrive at the volume 2 (V = 1.13 cm3 ), where they collide with\neach other and some of them after collision fly along the neutron guide 3 with collimators 4,\nand arrive at the detector 5, where they are registered with \u223c 100% efficiency. The collimators\n4 determine the solid angle \u2206\u03a9 = 0.64 \u00d7 10\u22124 , at which the volume V is visible by the detector.\nThe estimated number of neutrons that can be registered at a single pulse is equal to\nNe = 2n2 V tp vT |b|2 d\u03a9,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere factor 2 takes into account that the detector can register scattered neutron or neutronscatterer. The square of the scattering amplitude |b|2 is defined as: |b|2 = |b0 |2 /4, where b0 is the\nsinglet scattering amplitude, which is accepted to be 18 fm, and factor 1/4 is statistical weight of\nthe singlet scattering. Therefore |b|2 = 8.1\u00d710\u221225 cm2 . The speed vT corresponds to the thermal\nspeed vT = 2200 m/s, and the factor vT |b|2 determines number of collisions in the neutron gas\nper unit time. The factor n2 is the square of the neutron density: n = \u03a6/vT = 3 \u00d7 1012 cm\u22123 .\n1\n\ne-mail ignatovi@nf.jinr.ru\n\n1\n\n\fFigure 1: Scheme of the experiment on direct measurement of n-n scattering [1]. 1 - reactor\ncore; 2 - volume of collisions; 3 - neutron guide; 4 - collimators; 5 - detector; 6 - neutrons\ntrap.\nAfter substitution of all the parameters into (1) we find Ne \u2248 170 neutrons per pulse. However\nit is the estimation number. To find real number counted by the single detector, Ns , it is\nnecessary to calculate the scattering process. Calculation shows that Ns = F Ne , where factor\nF is of the order unity. Monte Carlo calculations in [1] give F = 0.83. Analytical calculations\npresented below give F = 0.705. The number of neutrons per pulse counted at coincidence, if\nthe neutrons trap 6 is replaced by another detector, can be estimated as\nNec = Ns d\u03a9\u03c4 /tT ,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere \u03c4 is the width of the coincidence window, tT = L/vT is the average length of measurement\ntime after the reactor pulse, and L \u2248 12 m is the average distance between collision volume\nand the detectors. In the experimental scheme of Fig. 1 the time tT is of the order 5 ms. If we\naccept \u03c4 \u2248 tp = 0.5 ms, then the ratio \u03c4 /tT is 0.1. The factor d\u03a9 is included in (2), because\nonly neutrons in this solid angle will be registered by the second detector. The total factor,\nwhich suppresses the estimated number of neutrons registered per single pulse in coincidence\nscheme, is of the order 10\u22125, therefore the estimated number of counts in coincidence scheme\nwill be 10\u22123 , so the experiment becomes non feasible, and the level of the background, which is\ndetermined by neutron scattering on the residual gas atoms present at even very good vacuum\nconditions, becomes irrelevant. The analytical calculations, presented below, show that the\nreal number of counted neutrons in coincidence scheme contains even additional small factor\nFc = 0.15.\n\n3\n\nThe analytical calculation of neutron scattering in the\nthermal neutron gas\n\nOur calculations will be based on the standard scattering theory of neutron scattering in the\natomic gas. Our main feature is that we shall make calculations directly in the laboratory\nreference frame without transition to the center of mass system. First we remind all the\n2\n\n\fdefinitions of the standard scattering theory and then present analytical calculations of all the\nrequired integrals.\n\n3.1\n\nThe standard scattering theory\n\nThe standard scattering theory starts with the Fermi golden rule, according to which one can\nwrite down the probability of the neutron scattering per unit time on an arbitrary system as\ndw(ki \u2192 kf , \u03bbi \u2192 \u03bbf ) =\n\n2\u03c0\n|h\u03bbf , kf |U|\u03bbi , ki i|2 \u03b4(Ef k + Ef \u03bb \u2212 Eik \u2212 Ei\u03bb )\u03c1(Ef k ),\nh\u0304\n\n(3)\n\nwhere |ki > , |\u03bbi > are initial, |kf >, |\u03bbf > are final states of the neutron and system with\nenergies Eik , Ei\u03bb , Ef k , Ef \u03bb respectively, U is the neutron-system interaction potential, which\nin the neutron atom scattering is accepted in the form of the Fermi pseudo potential\nh\u03042\nU=\n4\u03c0b\u03b4(r 1 \u2212 r 2 ).\n2m\n\n(4)\n\nHere r 1 , r 2 are positions of the neutron and the system, \u03c1(Ef k ) is the density of the neutron\nfinal states\n\u0013\n\u0012\nL 3 3\n\u03c1(Ek ) =\nd k,\n(5)\n2\u03c0\nEk = h\u03042 k 2 /2m, m is the neutron mass, and L is the size of some arbitrary space cell.\nWe suppose that the system is an atom with mass M = m, and momentum p. The initial\nand final states of the neutron and atom are described with similar wave functions\n|ki,f >=\n\n1\nexp(iki,f r),\nL3/2\n\n|\u03bbi,f >\u2261 |pi,f >=\n\n1\nexp(ipi,f r),\nL3/2\n\n(6)\n\nwhere ki,f and pi,f are initial and final neutron and atom momenta respectively.\nThe flux density of the single incident neutron is\nji = h\u0304ki /mL3 .\n\n(7)\n\nThe scattering cross section at the given initial and final states is the ratio\n1\ndw(ki \u2192 kf , pi \u2192 pf ).\nji\n\nd\u03c3(ki \u2192 kf , pi \u2192 pf ) =\n\n(8)\n\nAt the next step we need to sum this cross section over final states of the system and average\nover initial states. In our case summation over the system final states is the integration over\ndensity of the atomic final states\nL\n\u03c1(Epf ) =\n2\u03c0\n\u0012\n\n\u00133\n\nd 3 pf .\n\n(9)\n\nThis integration gives the cross section for the given initial states as\nd\u03c3(ki \u2192 kf , pi )\n2\u03c0m L9 d3 kf\n=2 2\nh\u0304 ki (2\u03c0)6\n\nZ\n\n2\n\nd3 pf hpf , kf |U|pi , ki i \u03b4(Ef k + Ef p \u2212 Eik \u2212 Eip ),\n\n(10)\n\nwhere Ep = h\u03042 p2 /2M, Ek = h\u03042 k 2 /2m, and the additional factor 2 means that the atom and\nneutron are the same particles, therefore we can detect with the same probability the scattered\nneutron in the phase element d3 kf or an atom in the element d3 pf .\n3\n\n\fFor our experiment we need not a cross section, but the number of the neutrons dN(ki , pi , kf )\nscattered in the element d3 kf . This number is determined by the number of collisions of neutrons with atoms, so the number of scattered neutrons is equal to\ndN(ki , pi , kf ) = dna (pi )dnn (ki )V dtp vd\u03c3(pi , ki \u2192 kf ),\n\n(11)\n\nwhere dna (pi ), dnn (ki ) are the number densities of atoms and neutrons with initial momenta\npi and ki respectively, v = h\u0304|pi \u2212 ki |/m is the relative neutron-atom velocity, and V , dtp are\nvolume and time, where collisions create detectable neutrons.\nSince our atoms and neutrons have the same Maxwellian distribution with the temperature\nT , the densities dna (pi ) and dnn (ki ) are\nd3 q\nq2\ndna (q) = dnn (q) = n\nexp\n\u2212\n(2\u03c0T )3/2\n2T\n\n!\n\n,\n\n(12)\n\nwhere n is the average neutrons density, the letter T denotes reduced temperature T =\nmkB [T ]/h\u03042 , and [T ] is the temperature in Kelvin degrees. To find the total number of neutrons\ndN(kf ) scattered into element d3 kf of the final momentum space we must integrate (11) over\ndna (pi )dnn (ki ), after which we get\ndN(kf ) = 2n2 V dtp\np2 + ki2\n\u00d7 exp \u2212 i\n2T\n\n1 L9 d3 kf 2\u03c0 2m\n(2\u03c0T )3 (2\u03c0)6 h\u0304 h\u03042\n\n!Z\n\nZ\n\nd 3 ki\n\nZ\n\nd 3 pi\n\n|pi \u2212 ki |\nki\n\n2\n\nd3 pf hpf , kf |V |pi , ki i \u03b4(kf2 + p2f \u2212 ki2 \u2212 p2i ).\n\n(13)\n\nThe matrix element of the potential (4) is\nhpf , kf |V |pi , ki i = 4\u03c0b\n\nh\u03042 (2\u03c0)3\n\u03b4(pi + ki \u2212 pf \u2212 kf ),\n2m L6\n\n(14)\n\nand its square is\n2\n\nhpf , kf |V |pi , ki i = |4\u03c0b|\n\n2\n\nh\u03042\n2m\n\n!2\n\n(2\u03c0)3\n\u03b4(pi + ki \u2212 pf \u2212 kf ).\nL9\n\n(15)\n\nAfter substitution of (15) into (13) we can extract |b|2\u221afrom the square of the matrix element,\nd\u03a9 from d3 kf and introduce the thermal speed vT = h\u0304 2T /m.

It means that the angle between kf and pf is approximately 180\u25e6 . Since we register both neutrons, we should not integrate (23) over d3 pf . Instead\nwe should accept kf pf < 0, pf \u2248 \u2212kf , and d3 pf = p2f dpf d\u03a9 with the same d\u03a9 as in d3 kf .\nTaking into account Eq. (16), (24) and (25) we can represent the number of neutrons counted\nby two detectors as\np2f + kf2\n2 kf2 dkf 2\n.\ndN(kf , pf ) = Ne d\u03a9pf 2\nqp dpf exp \u2212\n\u03c0 (2T )7/2 f\n2T\n\u221a\n\u221a\nAfter transformation to dimensionless variables y = kf / 2T and z = pf / 2T we get\n!\n\ndN(kf , pf ) = Ne d\u03a9p G(y, z)dydz,\nwhere\nG(y, z) =\n\n(35)\n\n(36)\n\n2y 2 z 2\n(y + z) exp(\u2212y 2 \u2212 z 2 ),\n2\n\u03c0\n\n(37)\n\nand we replaced q by kf + pf .\nTo get TOF spectrum in one detector and coincidence count in the second one with coincidence window \u03c4 we must multiply (36) by the unit\n1 = dt\u03b4(t \u2212 L/vT y)dt\u2032 \u03b4(t\u2032 \u2212 L/vT z + t)\n\n(38)\n\nand integrate over dydz.

Analytically calculated factor F = 0.705 is close\nto that F = 0.83, calculated by Monte Carlo method. The difference can be attributed to\nslightly different spectra of neutrons in the collision volume. In Monte Carlo calculations\nspectrum contained Maxwellian part and epithermal tail, while for analytical calculations we\nused only Maxwellian part. We did not calculated background which is related to scattering\nof neutrons on gas molecules, but we claim that it also can be calculated analytically. One\nof the main conclusions of this paper is that coincidence scheme for this type of experiment\nis absolutely impractical, because the effect becomes so low, that the level of the background\nbecomes irrelevant.\n\nacknowledgments\nI am grateful to A.V.Strelkov for introduction me to this problem and to W.Furman, E.Lychagin\nand A.Muzychka for interest and discussion.\n\n6\n\nThe history of submissions and rejections\n\nI submitted this paper on March 10 to the same journal J. Phys. G: Nucl. Part. Phys., where\nthe two papers[1, 2] were published. On March 31 I received the electronic mail from editors\nwith subject Final decision on your article from J. Phys. G: Nucl. Part. Phys., which\nmeant that no more negotiations are supposed. The letter contained the referee report. I am\nnot permitted by arXiv policy to present full content of the report, so I give a paraphrase of it.\n\n6.1\n\nIn his report the referee writes\n\nthat the paper is not worth of further consideration by the journal, because the journal has\nalready published articles where neutron spectra were calculated by Monte Carlo techniques.\nAnalytical calculations by standard technique are not worth to be published. A new result of the\npaper, which shows that coincidence scheme is not profitable was also obtained by participants\nof the project (their result was not yet published or submitted for publication), therefore it is\nnecessary to reject the paper.\n\n8\n\n\f6.2\n\nMy remark not sent to the editor\n\nIn my opinion analytical calculation is much superior to Monte Carlo one. If it was not known\nand became known only later, it is worth its own publication. Even if it gives the same result\nas Monte Carlo one, it is very important, because it proves that Monte Carlo calculations was\nmade correctly. No one can check Monte Carlo calculations. Every one can check analytical\ncalculations. It is great that for analytical calculations one need nothing except standard theory,\nbecause, if it were necessary to make some new assumption, the merit of analytical calculation\nwould become doubtful.\nReferee also pointed out, that the papers [1,2] contain calculation of signal and background,\nwhile I calculated only signal. To this remark I can say that I am able to calculate the background too. However this analytical calculation is more laborious and why to do it, if it had\nalready been calculated by the Monte-Carlo method, and analytical calculation are not worth\nof a \"stand-alone\" publication?\nAfter getting this reply I reconsidered my article and improved it. But in essence it remained\nthe same. So the referee, if he were able to read the improved version, would have no reason\nto change his report.\n\n6.3\n\nThe end of the story\n\nOn April 3 I submitted the paper to Yad.Phys. (Russian Nuclear Physics), and on April 29\nI received the referee report, which approved the paper and contained some comments that\nhelped me to improve it even further. So I want to express my gratitude to him.\n\n6.4\n\nThe story continues\n\nAfter correction of the article I submitted it again to Yad. Phys. but after few days I obtained\nthe letter, where editors asked me to delete section 6. I replied why? Whether it is not my right\nto publish everything, which is related to the problem? More over the referee did not require\nto omit this part. But in the next letter the editors informed me that the referee considered\nthe deletion of the section 6 as self-evident. I sent to the editorial board my arguments why to\naccept my paper with the section 6. They are:\n1. It is nasty to forbid something which can be permitted.\n2. It is nasty to apply power where it is useless.\n3. Publication of the section 6 is harmful only for editorial board of the J. Phys. G, and\ntheir referee, but is very profitable for the whole scientific community, because it shows\nthat irresponsible referee reports will be published and it is a real punishment for them.\n4. Any decision of the Yad. Phys. editors will be historical one, because I shall publish\neverything in the ArXiv, but the positive decision will demonstrate that the editorial\nboard agree with me and takes the responsibility for future reports of its referees.\n5. The section 6 is not irrelevant to the content of the paper. It rises the important question: whether analytical calculations merit publication as a stand-alone article or not, if\neverything can be calculated numerically by, say, Monte-Carlo method.\nNotwithstanding of my arguments the verdict was \u2013 to delete the section 6. One of the vice\nchief editors (he is not anonymous and advised me not to reveal his name) wrote me that he\nCANNOT publish because it contradicts to the LAW of GENRE. I asked him which article\n9\n\n\fof the GENRE LAW does he refers? One of the Journals publishes my articles with referee\nreports. The editorial board does not think that it contradicts the GENRE LAW and I take\noff my hat to their editors. However, since there are no arguments except the claim that the\nJournal CANNOT publish the section 6, I consider it as a demonstration of power to which I\nam to obey. I delete the section, but I shall publish the full article in the ArXiv, and there I\nshall explain why the section 6 is excluded from the article published in Yad.Phys.\n\n6.5\n\nAn attempt to publish JINR preprint\n\nI wanted also to publish my paper with section 6 as a preprint of JINR. The chief of publishing\ndepartment told me that she has no right to publish such a section without approval by Scientific\nSecretary (SS). I applied to SS for permission, but in vain. Then I appealed to our director (D)\nwith the same arguments as above.\n-Stop! - said one of my friends to whom I told the story. - I can predict the end of it.\nThe D will sent your article again to SS. The SS will return it to D with a note: \"I consider it\nnot appropriate\", and the D will write \"I agree\" and sign such a resolution!\nI was astonished how smart was my friend!\n\nReferences\n[1] W.I.Furman, E.V.Lychagin, A.Yu.Muzichka, et al, J.
