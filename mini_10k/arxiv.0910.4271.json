The fitted potentials describe accurately both scattering and\nbound quantities and extrapolate well to other stable nuclei. Further experimental information will be gathered to constrain extrapolations toward the driplines.\n1. Introduction\nExperiments with radioactive beams are unraveling the properties of nuclei at the limits\nof stability [ 1]. Studies of low-energy processes and transfer reactions require optical\npotentials (OP) suitable for dripline isotopes. This is also important for astrophysics\napplications, where capture and decay processes require a consistent determination of\nboth scattering and bound states. Dispersive optical models (DOM) provide a useful tool\nthat allows one to describe the mean field consistently over a broad energy range.\nThe DOM is grounded in the theory of many-body Green's functions (or propagators) [ 2] and in the proven equivalence between the many-body self-energy (of propagator theory) and the Feshbach theory of the microscopic optical model [ 3]. In practice the DOM can be thought as a parametrization of the self-energy. This has several advantages. It allows us to develop an OP that describes consistently both elastic\nscattering and bound-state properties. The theory directly imposes important analytic\nconstraints, such as the dispersion relation between the real and imaginary components\n(see below). Also microscopic calculations [ 4] can be employed to determine the physical\ningredients of the potentials.\nThe DOM was developed by Mahaux and collaborators for a number of individual\nmagic or near magic nuclei [ 5]. Recently, the authors of Refs. [ 6, 7] have performed\na DOM study for the chain of Ca isotopes. This employed the world data on 40\u221248 Ca,\nincluding both elastic scattering (up to 200 MeV) and bound-state information from (e,e\u2032 p)\nexperiments. This analysis also discussed possible extrapolations toward the driplines and\nsuggested new experiments to constrain the predictions for exotic nuclei [ 8]. A global\nparametrization of the coupled-channel DOM was also reported in Ref. [ 9] for stable\nnuclei.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nC.

For p+42 Ca, the data and curves are scaled down by an additional factor of 100.\n\nThe present talk discusses briefly the analysis of Refs. [ 6, 7] and points to open issues\nthat are being addressed to refine the predictions for unstable isotopes.\n2. The DOM for Ca Isotopes\nWhile the nucleon self-energy is an energy dependent and non-local potential, the vast\nmajority of DOM applications employ a local approximation of it. The same approach is\nfollowed here, although this approximation may be removed in future works. Mahaux and\nSartor [ 5] start by separating the real part of the optical potential at the Fermi surface\n(VHF ) and write the DOM as\nU(r, E) = VHF (r, E) + \u2206V(r, E) + iW(r, E) ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere VHF (r, E) is the local equivalent of the self-energy, Re\u03a3(r, r \u2032 ; EF ), at the Fermi\nenergy (EF )1 . Normally, this would be a static potential but it acquires an energydependence to account for the non-locality of \u03a3(r, r \u2032 ; EF ). The real and imaginary parts\nof the dynamic components of the DOM are linked by the subtracted dispersion relation,\n\u2206V(r, E) =\n1\n\n1\nP\n\u03c0\n\nZ\n\nW(r, \u03c9)\n\n\u0012\n\n1\n1\n\u2212\n\u03c9 \u2212 E \u03c9 \u2212 EF\n\n\u0013\n\nd\u03c9 .\n\n(2)\n\nStrictly speaking, VHF is not an Hartree-Fock potential but it does describe the effects of the nuclear\nmean-field. We maintain this notation for consistency with the rest of the literature.\n\n\f3\n\nDOM for Ca isotopes\n\n0\n\n0.5\n0\n-0.5\n\nEp=65.

Fitted (horizontal lines) and experimental (data points) level properties for the\n0d5/2 , 1s1/2 , and 0d3/2 proton hole states for 40 Ca (left panels) and 48 Ca (right panels).\nThe fitted quantities include the root-mean-squared radius Rrms , the spectroscopic factors\nS and the widths \u0393 of these states.\n\nThis relation is a direct consequence of the causality principle, which is therefore embedded\nin the model. Thus, the DOM is fully determined by parametrizing only the VHF (r, E)\nand W(r, E) components. The explicit form employed in this work is reported in detail\nin Ref. [ 7].\nThe potential (1) was fitted to published data sets at both positive and negative energies. These included elastic scattering data for p+40,42,44,48 Ca and n+40 Ca, with energies\nup to 200 MeV, total reaction cross sections, experimental single-particle levels and spectroscopic factors and radii of proton bound states measured in (e,e\u2032 p) reactions. The\nquality of the fit to the differential cross sections and analysing powers is shown in Figs. 1\nand 2 (left). For proton bound states, only one data point could not be reproduced, i.e.,\nthe s1/2 orbit in 40 Ca as shown in Fig. 1 (right). An independent re-analysis of (e,e\u2032 p)\ndata has later corrected this value and resolved this discrepancy [ 10].\nFor such a large body of data (81 data sets comprising 3569 data points), the excellent\nagreement of the fit with just 25 free parameters provides confidence in the predictive\npower of the DOM calculations.\n3. Extrapolation to Other Isotopes\nFigure 3 shows a preliminary comparison between the elastic proton scattering on stable\nNi sotopes and the prediction of the above DOM, which was fitted to Ca data only. The\noverall agreement is quite satisfying and shows the potentiality for global fits with this\napproach. However, proper extrapolations to unstable isotopes (and in particular close to\nthe driplines) require particular care for the N/Z asymmetry dependence of the surface\npart of the imaginary potential. This is usually assumed to behave as\nWs (E) = Ws0 (E) + \u03b5\n\nN \u2212Z 1\nWs (E) .\nA\n\n(3)\n\n\f4\n\nC.

(Color online) Preliminary comparison between the proton scattering data on\nNi isotopes and the prediction from the DOM of Ref. [ 7] (fitted solely to Ca isotopes).\nThe plot shows the ratio with respect to the Rutherford differential cross sections.\n\nThe choice for protons is \u03b5p =+1, which works quite well for p+40\u221248 Ca scattering. For\nneutrons, the standard assumption in the literature (\u03b5n =-1) leads to inconsistencies for\nneutron-rich isotopes. Similar difficulties have also been reported in a recent global OP\nfit [ 11].\nUnfortunately, the n+40 Ca scattering data solely available to Ref. [ 7] are not sufficient\nto constrain \u03b5n . Choosing \u03b5n =0 was found to be consistent with spectroscopic factors\nfrom (d,p) reactions but does not rule out other possibilities. New data for the n+48 Ca\nhave recently been taken to verify this assumption [ 8]. It is expected that this will allow\nnew fits that improve the description of dripline isotopes.\nThis work is supported by the U.S. Department of Energy, Division of Nuclear Physics\nunder grant DE-FG02-87ER-40316 and the U.S. National Science Foundation under grant\nPHY-0652900.
