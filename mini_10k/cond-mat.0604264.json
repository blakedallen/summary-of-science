In this paper, we demonstrate that\nthe superconducting phase of c = 19.6 anstrom can be directly obtained by simply\nimmersing gamma-Na0.7CoO2 powders in electrolyzed/oxidized (EO) water, which is\nreadily available from a commercial electrolyzed water generator. We found that high\noxidation-reduction potential of EO water drives the oxidation of the cobalt ions\naccompanying by the formation of the superconductive c = 19.6 anstrom phase. Our\nresults demonstrate how EO water can be used to oxidize the cobalt ions and hence\nform superconducting cobalt oxyhydrates in a clean and simple way and may provide an\neconomic and environment-friendly route to oxidize the transition metal of complex\nmetal oxides.\n\n\f2\n\nSuperconducting cobalt oxyhydrate Na0.35(H2O)1.3CoO2-\u03b4with Tc \u22484.5 K can be\nsynthesized either via a simple process by immersing it in an oxidizing solution such as\nBr2 in CH3CN1, Na2S2O8(aq)2, KMnO4(aq)3, and NaMnO4(aq)4, or anodically polarizing it 5\nwith a constant voltage of 0.6-1.2 V at room temperature. Like high-Tc copper oxide\nsuperconductor, the superconducting transition temperature Tc and the oxidation\nnumber of cobalt ion are associated with the cationic content in the charge reservoir and\nthe oxygen content in the cobalt oxyhydrates.6,7 During electrolysis of water, it creates\non the anode area an acidic water, which is severely lacking electrons and is therefore\ncalled electrolyzed/oxidized (EO) water having a high oxidation-reduction potential\n(ORP). We have found that simply immersing 100 mg of \u03b3\n-Na0.7CoO2 powders in the\n250 ml EO water can result in the same superconductive c \u2248 19.6 \u00c5 phase of\nNa0.35(H2O)1.3CoO2-\uf064 with Tc \u22484 K. This is achieved by the deintercalation of Na+,\noxidation of Co ions and subsequent hydration process of intercalating the water\nmolecules between the CoO2 layers and Na+ layers. Figure 1 shows the powder x-ray\ndiffraction pattern for the EO water-treated sample. All the reflections of the EO watertreated product are the same as those of the Br2- or NaMnO4- treated samples, which\nindicates the same crystal structure having space group P63/mmc (space group # 194)\nwith c \u224819.6 \u00c5 evidenced by the fingerprint of (002) reflection occurring at 2\uf071\uf0bb11.3\uf0b0\n(d spacing \uf0bb9.81 \u00c5) for Fe K\uf061radiation.\nWe now know that the superconductive c \u224819.6 \u00c5 phase is unstable in the\nambient environment and readily transforms into c \u224813.8 \u00c5 phase in an environment\nwithout sufficient humidity.8 Figure 2 shows that the (002) reflection at 2\uf071\uf0bb11.3\uf0b0of\nthe EO-treated sample still remains after being exposed to ambient air for 21 days,\nwhich is in sharp contrast with the instability of the Br-treated Na0.35(H2O)1.3CoO2-\uf064.\nOne can see the (004) reflection turns into a broader and asymmetric peak, which is\nlikely associated with the initial stage of disorder in the interlayer distance of CoO2\n\n\f3\n\nlayers caused by the random stacking of water bilayers and monolayers between the\nCoO2 layers, a reminiscent case of Na1/3(H2O)1.5TaS2.9\nFrom all the previous reports, it is also well known that the fully hydrated c \u224819.6\n\u00c5 phase is a superconductor with Tc \u22484 K. In order to confirm the superconductivity of\nthe EO-treated sample, Fig. 3 shows the dc mass magnetization data of the EO watertreated sample measured in a field of 10 Oe down to 2 K. Both zero field cooled and\nfield cooled data clearly show a diamagnetic signal of magnetization and a rapid\ndecrease starting with 4.2 K, indicating a superconducting transition with an onset\ntemperature of 4.2 K. The mass magnetization at 2 K is -3.47\uf0b410-3 emu/g and -7.49\uf0b4103\n\nemu/g in the field-cooled mode and zero-field- cooled mode, respectively.\nFurthermore, we have also found that simply immersing \u03b3\n-Na0.7CoO2 in the tap\n\nwater without using any other oxidizing agent can result in a deep de-intercalation of\nNa+ and large oxygen deficiency but would not oxidize the Co ions. The composition\nanalysis using inductively coupled plasma atomic-emission spectrometry (ICP-AES),\nwater content determination using thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA), and oxygen\ncontent determination using iodometric titration show that the tap water-treated product\nhas the chemical formula of Na0.29(H2O)0.41CoO1.78. The spontaneous deintercalation of\nNa+ from the host lattice might be due to the stronger Na-Co Coulomb repulsion for Na+\nin the 2b site as compared that in the 2d site, which makes \u03b3\n-Na0.7CoO2 have the escape\ntendency of Na+ when being immersed in a solution. After deintercalating some of the\nNa+ from the host lattice, the coulomb attraction between the positive charges of Na+\nand the negative charges of O2- becomes smaller and consequently results in a slight\nexpansion along the c-axis. This fact can be seen in Fig. 2. As compared to 2\u03b8= 20.44\u00b0\n(d = 5.456 \u00c5) in the XRD pattern for \u03b3\n-Na0.7CoO2, the (002) reflection of the tape\nwater-treated sample is found to shift to a lower angle at 2\u03b8= 20.02\u00b0 (d = 5.569 \u00c5),\nwhich corresponds to c \u224811.2 \u00c5. One should note that treating \u03b3\n-Na0.7CoO2 using the\n\n\f4\n\nEO water having insufficient ORP leads to a similar XRD pattern to that using the tap\nwater.\n\nThe energy shifts of d orbital in transition metals arising from metal-anion ligand\ninteractions could be described by the angular overlap model (AOM),10 which is a first\napproximation to the full molecular orbital model and could facilitate the understanding\nof the principles of transition metal oxides. For octahedral geometry, d orbitals are split\ninto threefold t2g and twofold eg states by the crystal field. For the NaxCoO2-\uf064system,\nthe threefold degenerate Co3+/4+:t2g band is further split by the trigonal crystal field into\nan a1g band and a twofold degenerate eg' band. Due to the covalent mixing of the Co 3d\nand O 2p states, electrons can be removed either from the Co 3d or O 2p bands upon\noxidation of the cobaltates, which depends on which is the highest occupied molecular\norbital (HOMO). Based on the wet-chemical redox analyses, NaxCoO2-\uf064and Li1-xCoO2\uf064 share\n\nsome similarity at deep de-intercalation of alkaline metal.7,11 The oxidation\n\nnumber of Co for both systems reaches a nearly constant value at deep de-intercalation\nof alkaline metal and could not increase further. Instead, large oxygen deficiency is\nalways found in these materials to compensate for the lower-than-expected oxidation\nnumber of Co, which is presumably a process of removing electrons from the O 2p\nbands instead of Co 3d bands to make up the loss of Na+ from the host lattice. Since the\nEO-treated sample has the same superconductive c \u2248 19.6 \u00c5 phase, we use\nNa0.36(H2O)1.3CoO1.91 in ref. 12 to compare with Na0.29(H2O)0.41CoO1.78 with c \u224811.2 \u00c5\nregarding the oxidation number of Co and oxygen deficiency. The oxidation number of\nCo is +3.48 and +3.27 for the former and the latter, respectively. One can readily see\nthe significant difference in the oxidation number of Co at deep deintercalation of Na+,\nwhich could be associated with the ORP of the solution used to treat the parent material\n\u03b3\n-Na0.7CoO2. The EO water has the ORP of ~880 mV, whereas the tap water has the\nORP of ~600 mV. The Hanna 7022 ORP solution with ORP = 470 mV at 25\u00b0C is used\nto calibrate the platinum electrode for measuring the ORP of EO water before use. It\n\n\f5\n\nseems that to remove electrons from the Co3+/4+:a1g band and oxidize the Co ions\nrequires an oxidizing solution with sufficient ORP. Insufficient ORP solution would not\noxidize the Co ions and only results in oxygen deficiency to maintain the charge\nneutrality at deep deintercalation of Na+. It is conceivable that hydrogen bonding\nbetween oxygen of the CoO2 layers and hydrogen of the water molecules play a\nsignificant role in stabilizing the c \u224819.6 \u00c5 phase.13 Therefore, the oxygen deficiency in\nthe tape water-treated sample could be responsible for being unable to form the c \u224819.6\n\u00c5 phase due to insufficient amount of hydrogen bonding.\n\nIn spite that some consider the electrolyzed water as aqua scam, a few benefits are\nclaimed for using electrolyzed water in dentistry, antiseptic, and horticulture\napplications. This work reveals several experimental findings that are critical for\nunderstanding the phase formation of superconductive sodium cobalt oxyhydrates.\nSufficient ORP of the EO water seems to be essential to transform the \u03b3\n-Na0.7CoO2 to\nthe c \u224819.6 \u00c5 phase. The key factor of forming the c \u224819.6 \u00c5 phase relies on whether\nthe oxidizing solution has the ability to abstract electrons from the cobalt ions.\nDeintercalation of Na+ for \u03b3\n-Na0.7CoO2 is spontaneous and would not necessarily bring\nabout oxidation of the cobalt ions. In our most recent results, Fig. 4 shows that EO\nwater can transform single crystal films of sodium cobalt oxide, which is made by\nlateral diffusion of sodium into Co3O4 (111) epitaxial film, to sodium cobalt\noxyhydrates with bilayers of water molecules intercalated into the host lattice.\n\n\f6\n\n1.

All the reflection peaks for the latter are indexable\nbased on the space group P63/mmc and are the same as those of Br2-treated\nsuperconducting Na0.35(H2O)1.3CoO2-\uf061.

The EO water is directly flown into a beaker from a commercial EO water\ngenerator and used as an oxidizing and hydration agent.\nFigure 2 Powder x-ray diffraction patterns (Fe K\uf061 radiation) of\uf020\n\uf028\na) tap water-treated\nNa0.29(H2O)0.41CoO1.78 and (b) EO-treated sample being stored in the ambient\nenvironment for 21 days. A broad hump (*) centred at 2\u03b8\u224823.\n6\u00b0is always found in the\nsamples treated with tap water and EO water having insufficient ORP, which could be\nassociated with the oxygen deficiency. A broader and asymmetric peak of (004)\nreflection indicates that the sample begins to show disordered sequence of water\nmonolayers and bilayers between the CoO2 layers.
