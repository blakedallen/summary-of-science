This is the famous \"nucleon spin problem\" raised by the EMC measurements nearly\ntwenty years ago [1],[2]. In the past few years, there have been several remarkable progresses\ntoward the resolution of this long-standing problem. Firstly, a lot of experimental evidences\nhave been accumulated, which indicate that the gluon polarization inside nucleon is likely\nto be small at least at the low renormalization scales [3]-[6]. At the least, it is now widely\naccepted that the UA (1)-anomaly motivated explanation of the nucleon spin puzzle is disfavored. Secondly, the quark spin fraction or the net longitudinal quark polarization \u2206\u03a3 has\nbeen fairly precisely determined through the high-statistics measurements of deuteron spin\nstructure function by the COMPASS [7],[8] and HERMES groups [9]. According to their\nnew analyses, the portion of the nucleon spin coming from the intrinsic quark spin is around\n30%. Putting together these two observations blindly, one might be led to the conclusion\nthat the rest of the nucleon spin must be carried by the orbital angular momentum of quarks\nand/or gluons. On the other hand, however, the recent lattice QCD simulations indicate\nthat the net orbital angular momentum carried by the quark fields is very small or close to\nzero [10] -[18]. Besides, based on the conjecture on the relation between the Sivers mechanism and the quark and gluon orbital angular momenta [19],[20], Brodsky and Gardner [21]\nargued that the small single-spin asymmetry observed by COMPASS collaboration on the\ndeuteron target [22] is an indication of small gluon orbital angular momentum inside the\nnucleon.\nNaively combining all the observations above, we might be led to the conclusion that\nthe nucleon constituents on aggregate do not carry enough amount of angular momentum\nsaturating the total nucleon spin. What's wrong with the above deduction? The purpose\nof the present study is to resolve the apparent paradox above. To clear up this confused\nstatus of our understanding of the nucleon spin puzzle, we propose to carry out an analysis,\nin which a special care is paid to the fact that the decomposition of the nucleon spin is an\nabsolutely scale-dependent idea. What plays a central role in this analysis is Ji's angular\nmomentum sum rule, supplemented with some additional knowledge listed below. The first\nis the information obtained from the recent theoretical studies of the isoscalar and isovector\nu+d\nu\u2212d\ncombinations of the nucleon anomalous gravitomagnetic moments, B20\n(0) and B20\n(0),\n\n2\n\n\fwithin the lattice QCD as well as within the chiral quark soliton model (CQSM). The 2nd is\nthe empirical information on the momentum fractions carried by the quarks and gluons, as\nwell as on the longitudinal quark polarizations. The 3rd is the observation, first made by Ji,\nthat the total angular momentum fractions carried by the quarks and gluons obey exactly\nthe same evolution equations as the momentum fractions of the quarks and gluons do.\nThe plan of the paper is as follows. First, in sect.II, we briefly review main predictions\nof the lattice QCD simulations for generalized form factors and the spin contents of the\nnucleon carried out in the past few years. On the other hand, sect III is devoted to new and\nimproved investigation of the corresponding generalized form factors within the framework of\nthe chiral quark soliton model (CQSM). Next, in sect IV, armed with the knowledge gained\nin the previous two sections, we try to carry out semi-empirical analysis of the nucleon spin\ncontents by paying special attention to their scale dependence. Several concluding remarks\nwill then be given in sect.V.\n\nII.\n\nLATTICE QCD PREDICTIONS ON NUCLEON SPIN CONTENTS\n\nMost theoretical analyses of the nucleon spin contents nowadays heavily relies upon Ji's\nangular momentum sum rule [23]-[26]. According to it, the total angular momentum carried\nby the quark field with flavor q is given as\nJq =\n\n1\n1\nq\nq\n[ Aq20 (0) + B20\n(0) ] =\n[ hxiq + B20\n(0) ] .\n2\n2\n\n(1)\n\nHere, Aq20 (0) is the forward (t \u2192 0) limit of the generalized Dirac form factor Aq20 (t), which\nis related to the 2nd moment of the unpolarized spin-non-flip generalized parton distribution\nfunction (GPD) H q (x, \u03be, t). It just reduces to the momentum fraction hxiq carried by the\nq\nquark with flavor q. On the other hand, B20\n(0) is the forward limit of the generalized\nq\nPauli form factor B20\n(t), which is sometimes called the anomalous gravitomagnetic moment\nq\n(0) is the contribution of the quark with flavor q to the nucleon\n(AGM). (More precisely, B20\nq\nAGM.) The quantity B20\n(0) is also related to the 2nd moment of the unpolarized spin-\n\nflip generalized parton distribution E q (x, \u03be, t), so that it is in principle measurable through\nthe high energy deeply virtual Compton scatterings (DVCS) and/or deeply virtual meson\nproduction (DVMP) processes [23],[26]. Confining to the two flavor case, for simplicity, we\n\n3\n\n\fhave two independent relations :\n\u0003\n1 \u0002\nu+d\nhxiu+d + B20\n(0) ,\n2\n\u0003\n1 \u0002\nu\u2212d\n=\nhxiu\u2212d + B20\n(0) .\n2\n\nJ u+d =\n\n(2)\n\nJ u\u2212d\n\n(3)\n\nSince the quark momentum fraction hxiu+d and hxiu\u2212d are empirically known fairly well, the\nu+d\nu\u2212d\nknowledge of B20\n(0) and B20\n(0) is essential to extract the total angular momentum J u\n\nand J d carried by the u- and d-quarks. In fact, these are the quantities of central interest\nin several lattice QCD studies [10] -[18]. Here, we briefly review the relevant predictions of\nlattice QCD studies on the nucleon spin contents in the past few years.\nu+d\nu\u2212d\nWe first look into the results on B20\n(0) and B20\n(0) reported by the QCDSF Collabo-\n\nration in [10],[11] some years ago. Their predictions are\nu+d\nB20\n(0) = 0.102 \u00b1 0.113,\n\nu\u2212d\nB20\n(0) = 0.566 \u00b1 0.113.\n\n(4)\n\n(We recall that their simulations were performed in the so-called heavy-pion region with\nm\u03c0 \u2243 (640 \u2212 1070) MeV. The values quoted in (4) are those extrapolated to the physical\npion mass. In practice, however, no strong pion mass dependencies were observed in their\nu\u2212d\nsimulations at this stage.) Combining (4) with their predictions on Au+d\n20 (0) and A20 (0),\n\ngiven by\nu+d\nAu+d\n= 0.547 \u00b1 0.022,\n20 (0) = hxi\n\nu\u2212d\nAu\u2212d\n= 0.253 \u00b1 0.022.\n20 (0) = hxi\n\n(5)\n\nthey estimated that\n2 J u = 0.74 \u00b1 0.12,\n\n2 J d = \u2212 0.08 \u00b1 0.08.\n\n(6)\n\nFurther combining with their results on the quark polarization,\n\u2206u + \u2206d = 0.60 \u00b1 0.02,\n\n\u2206u \u2212 \u2206d = 1.08 \u00b1 0.02,\n\n(7)\n\nthey concluded that the net orbital angular momentum (OAM) of the quarks is very small\nor consistent with zero :\n2 Lu+d = 0.06 \u00b1 0.14.\n\n(8)\n\nu\u2212d\nu+d\n(0) is reported by the LHPC Collaboration\n(0) and B20\nAn independent studies of B20\n\n[12]-[15] :\nu+d\nB20\n(0) = \u22120.09 \u00b1 0.03,\n\nu\u2212d\nB20\n(0) = 0.67 \u00b1 0.03.\n\n4\n\n(9)\n\n\fUsing their previous results for the quark momentum fractions as well as the quark longitudinal polarizations [16],\n\u2206\u03a3 = 0.682 \u00b1 0.018,\n\n(10)\n\nthey also estimated the quark orbital angular momentum to get\nLu = \u2212 0.088 \u00b1 0.019,\n\nLd = 0.036 \u00b1 0.013,\n\n(11)\n\nor\n2 Lu+d = \u2212 0.104 \u00b1 0.038,\n\n2 Lu\u2212d = \u2212 0.248 \u00b1 0.038,\n\n(12)\n\nTheir conclusion at this stage was as follows. Both flavor separately give a rather small\ncontribution of the order of 17 % (7 %) for u-quark (d-quark) to the nucleon spin, due\nto cancellation in quark momentum fraction, spin and B20 [15]. Adding further u and d\ncontributions give a very small and negative total orbital angular momentum.\nComparing the results of the two groups, one notices several discrepancies. For instance,\nu+d\nthe central value of the QCDSF prediction for B20\n(0) is small and positive, while the\n\ncorresponding prediction by the LHPC group is small and negative. In spite of these discrepancies, a main conclusion of the two analyses was common : the net OAM carried by the\nquarks is very small or consistent with zero. As admitted by themselves, however, a main\nproblem of their analyses was that these conclusions were obtained from the simulations\nperformed with fairly large pion mass, ranging from 640 MeV to 1070 MeV.\nVery recently, both groups carried out more refined analyses of the nucleon spin contents.\nThe simulations were extended to much lower pion mass and the results were further extrapolated to the physical pion mass with the help of chiral perturbation theory. We first\noverview the main results of the LHPC Collaboration [17]. For the chiral extrapolation, they\ntried several versions of chiral perturbation theory, i.e. covariant baryon chiral perturbation\ntheory (BChPT), heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory (HBChPT) with and without the\n\u2206 resonance. The results obtained with use of covariant BChPT are\nAu+d\n20 (0) = 0.520 \u00b1 0.014,\n\nAu\u2212d\n20 (0) = 0.157 \u00b1 0.006,\n\nu+d\nB20\n(0) = \u2212 0.094 \u00b1 0.050,\n\nu\u2212d\nB20\n(0) = 0.274 \u00b1 0.037,\n\n(13)\n(14)\n\nwhich give\n2 J u+d = 0.426 \u00b1 0.052,\n\n2 J u = 0.428 \u00b1 0.032,\n5\n\n2 J d = \u2212 0.002 \u00b1 0.032.\n\n(15)\n\n\fOn the other hand, the predictions obtained with the HBChPT without the \u2206 resonance\nare given only for the isoscalar quantities :\nAu+d\n20 (0) = 0.485 \u00b1 0.014,\n\n(16)\n\nu+d\nB20\n(0) = 0.050 \u00b1 0.049,\n\n(17)\n\n2 J u+d = 0.526 \u00b1 0.048.\n\n(18)\n\nwhich give\n\nOne sees that the final answers are fairly sensitive to the ways of chiral extrapolation. In\nu+d\nparticular, B20\n(0), one of our central interest, is slightly negative in the covariant BChPT,\n\nwhile it is slightly positive in HBChPT. In either case, combined with their new preliminary\nu+d\nestimate for the quark spin \u00c3u+d\n, they reconfirmed their previous conclusion\n10 (t = 0) = \u2206\u03a3\n\nthat the net quark orbital angular momentum is nearly zero.\nThe QCDSF-UKQCD Collaboration also carried out a similar analysis [18]. Their main\nresults are summarized as\nAu+d\n20 (0) = 0.572 \u00b1 0.012,\nu+d\n(0) = \u2212 0.120 \u00b1 0.023,\nB20\n\nAu\u2212d\n20 (0) = 0.198 \u00b1 0.008,\n\n(19)\n\nu\u2212d\n(0) = 0.269 \u00b1 0.020.\nB20\n\n(20)\n\nWe point out that these new results by the QCDSF-UKQCD group changed considerably\nfrom the previous QCDSF predictions obtained in the heavy-pion region several years ago\n[10],[11]. This would mainly be an effect of chiral extrapolation to the physical pion mass.\nu\u2212d\nu+d\nu\u2212d\nPutting aside moderate changes of Au+d\n20 (0) and A20 (0), the changes of B20 (0) and B20 (0)\nu+d\nare drastic. First, even the sign is changed for B20\n(0), although the fact, that its absolute\n\nvalue is relatively small, is intact. Also drastic is a considerable (more than a factor of two)\nu\u2212d\n(0). (This is also the case for the old and new\nreduction of the magnitude of isovector B20\nu\u2212d\n(0) [14],[15],[17].) Here, we emphasize that this reduction was\nLHPC predictions for B20\nu\u2212d\npredicted in our theoretical analysis of B20\n(0) within the chiral quark soliton model [27]. In\n\nfact, it was shown there that this quantity has a strong pion mass dependence and that the\nlattice QCD predictions obtained in the heavy-pion region has a danger of overestimating it.\nu+d\nThe QCDSF-UKQCD Collaboration also carried out a new estimate of \u00c3u+d\n10 (0) = \u2206\u03a3\n\n[18] and obtain\n\u2206\u03a3u+d = 0.402 \u00b1 0.048.\n6\n\n(21)\n\n\fCombining these, they finally obtain an estimate\n2 J u+d = 0.452 \u00b1 0.026,\n\n2 Lu+d = 0.050 \u00b1 0.054.\n\n(22)\n\nThus, despite some appreciable changes of the predictions for some generalized form factors,\na common conclusion of the two lattice QCD groups, that the net quark OAM is small,\nappears to be reconfirmed also by these new analyses.\nNow we have a dilemma. Neither of the intrinsic quark spin, the gluon polarization, nor\nthe quark OAM seems to carry enough amount of angular momentum to saturate the total\nnucleon spin. Does it mean that the rest of the nucleon spin is mostly carried by the gluon\nOAM ? As already mentioned, however, very large gluon OAM seems to contradict the\nrecent claim by Brodsky and Gardner based on the observed small single-spin asymmetry\non the deuteron target by the COMPASS group [21],[22]. In our opinion, this confused\nstatus arises because we have not paid enough care to the fact that the decomposition of the\nnucleon spin is a highly scale-dependent idea. Later, we shall carry out an analysis, which\npays more careful attention to the scale dependencies of the nucleon spin decomposition.\n\nIII.\n\nCHIRAL QUARK SOLITON MODEL PREDICTIONS\n\nIn a previous paper [27], we investigated the generalized form factors of the nucleon\nwithin the framework of the CQSM. A particular emphasis was put there on the pion mass\ndependence of the relevant quantities. (A similar analysis was carried out also in [28]-[30].\nSee also [31], in which the strong pion mass dependence of the net quark polarization \u2206\u03a3\nin the chiral region was pointed out.) We discuss here only the predictions on Au+d\n20 (0),\nu+d\nu\u2212d\n(0), Au+d\nB20\n20 (0), and B20 (0), which provide us with enough information for the nucleon\n\nspin decomposition.\nA largest discrepancy between the predictions of the CQSM and those of the lattice\nu\u2212d\nQCD simulations was observed for the isovector AGM B20\n(0) of the nucleon [27], so that\n\nwe will start our discussion with this quantity. Within the framework of the CQSM, or more\ngenerally in any other low energy models, the forward (t \u2192 0) limits of the isovector Pauli\nu\u2212d\nu\u2212d\nform factor B10\n(t) as well as the AGM form factor B20\n(t) are calculated as the difference\n\nof the standard and generalized Sachs magnetic and electric form factors at t = 0 as (see\n\n7\n\n\f[27] for more detail)\n(I=1)\n\n(I=1)\n\n(23)\n\n(I=1)\n\n(I=1)\n\n(24)\n\nu\u2212d\nB10\n(0) = GM,10 (0) \u2212 GE,10 (0),\nu\u2212d\nB20\n(0) = GM,20 (0) \u2212 GE,20 (0).\n\nFor completeness, we list below the theoretical expressions for the above quantities within\n(I=1)\n\nthe CQSM. The isovector electric form factor in the forward limit, i.e. GE,10 (0) is just\nreduced to the isovector charge of the nucleon, which denotes that\n(I=1)\n\nGE,10 (0) = 1.\n\n(25)\n(I=1)\n\nOn the other hand, the isovector gravitomagnetic moment GE,20 (0) is given as\n(I=1)\nGE,20 (0)\n\n1 1\n=\nMN 3 I\n\n\u0012\n\nNc\n2\n\n\u00d7 hm|| \u03c4 ||ni\n\n\u0013\n\u001a\n\nX\n\nm>0,n\u22640\n\n1\nEm \u2212 En\n\n1\nEm + En\nhm|| \u03c4 ||ni + hm|| (\u03b1 * p) \u03c4 ||ni\n2\n3\n\n\u001b\n\n,\n\n(26)\n\nwith MN being the nucleon mass. Here, |ni and En are the eigenstates and the corresponding\neigenenergies of the static Dirac Hamiltonian H with the hedgehog mean field, i.e.\nH |ni = En |ni,\n\n(27)\n\nwhere\n\u03b1*\u2207\n+ \u03b2 M [ cos F (r) + i \u03b35 \u03c4 * r\u0302 sin F (r) ] ,\n(28)\ni\nP\nP\nwith M being the dynamical quark mass. The symbols\nn\u22640 and\nm>0 stand for the\nH =\n\nsummation over all the occupied and unoccupied single-quark eigenstates of H. (The fact\n(I=1)\n\nthat GE,20 (0) is given as a double sum over the single-quark orbitals is connected with\nthe fact that it vanishes at the mean-field level and survives only at the first order in the\ncollective angular velocity of the soliton.)\n(I=1)\n\nConcerning the isovector magnetic moment GM,10 (0) and the corresponding isovector\n(I=1)\n\ngravitomagnetic moment GM,20 (0), some comments are in order. In our previous study [27],\nwe have calculated only the leading-order contributions to these quantities and neglected\nthe subleading 1/Nc corrections, for simplicity. In the present study, we shall include the\nlatters as well. The reason is because a similar 1/Nc correction (or more concretely, the 1storder rotational correction in the collective angular velocity of the soliton) is known to be\n8\n\n\fimportant for resolving the famous underestimation problem of some isovector observables,\nlike the isovector axial-charge, inherent in the hedgehog-type soliton model [32]-[34]. Taking\naccount of this 1st order rotational correction, the isovector magnetic moment of the nucleon\nconsists of the leading O(\u03a90 ) term and the subleading O(\u03a91 ) term as\n(I=1)\n\n(I=1) \u03a90\n\nGM,10 (0) = GM,10\n\n(I=1) \u03a91\n\n(0) + GM,10\n\n(0),\n\n(29)\n\nwhere\nX\nMN\nNc\nhn|| (x \u00d7 \u03b1) * \u03c4 ||ni,\n(30)\n9\nn\u22640\n\u0012\n\u0013 X\n1\nNc\nMN\n(I=1) \u03a91\nhm|| \u03c4 ||ni hm|| (x \u00d7 \u03b1) \u00d7 \u03c4 ||ni.

(34)\n2\n(I=1)\u03a90\n\nGM,20\n\n(0) = \u2212\n\nAs usual, the above sums over the eigenstates of H can be evaluated with use of the\ndiscretized momentum basis of Kahana and Ripka [35],[36]. (Some generalization of the\nKahana-Ripka basis is necessary for the evaluation of the O(\u03a91 ) terms including double\nsums [37].) Now, we are ready to show the results of our numerical calculation. Similarly\nto the analysis reported in [27], we see the effect of varying the pion mass m\u03c0 , by fixing the\ndynamical quark mass M to be 400 MeV. For that purpose, we prepare self-consistent soliton\nsolutions for seven values of m\u03c0 , i.e. m\u03c0 = 0, 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, and 600 MeV, within the\ndouble-subtraction Pauli-Villars regularization scheme [38]. Favorable physical predictions\nwill be obtained by using the value M = 400 MeV and m\u03c0 = 100 MeV, since this set\ngives a self-consistent solution close to the phenomenologically successful one obtained with\nM = 375 MeV and m\u03c0 = 0 MeV in the single-subtraction Pauli-Villars regularization scheme\n9\n\n\f[39]-[41]. (For the nucleon mass MN , appearing in the above formulas of the generalized\nform factors, the theoretical consistency requires us to use self-consistent soliton masses.\nOtherwise, fundamental conservation laws like the momentum sum rule would be violated.\nSee [27] for the detail.)\nTABLE I: The CQSM predictions for the isovector magnetic moment of the nucleon in dependence\nof the pion mass.

These are the predictions\n\nalready given in our previous paper. What is new here is the 5th column, which represent\nthe 1st order rotational correction to the isovector AGM of the nucleon. We have already\nseen that the 1st order rotational correction is very important for reproducing the observed\nisovector magnetic moment of the nucleon. Table II shows that the effect of the 1st order\nrotational correction is even more drastic for the isovector AGM of the nucleon. This is\nbecause the leading-order estimate of the isovector AGM shown in the 3rd column is ob(I=1)\n\n(I=1)\n\ntained as the difference of the two quantities GM,20 (0) and GE,20 (0), having the same size\nof magnitude, and a sizable cancellation occurs between them. As a consequence, the final\npredictions of the CQSM for the isovector AGM of the nucleon, given in the 7th column are\nnearly a factor of 3 or 4 larger than our previous results neglecting the 1st order rotational\ncorrection.\nAt this stage, one might be interested in a comparison with the predictions of lattice\nQCD. One must be careful here. Different from the anomalous magnetic moment of the\nnucleon, which is scale independent due to the conservation of the electromagnetic current,\nthe anomalous gravitomagnetic moment is a scale-dependent quantity. The predictions of\nthe lattice QCD simulations corresponds to the renormalization scale of Q2 \u2243 4 GeV2 , while\nthe predictions of the CQSM is thought to correspond to much lower energy scale around\n11\n\n\fQ2 = 0.30 GeV2 . Fortunately, by making use of Ji's observation that J q and hxiq obey\nu\u2212d\nexactly the same evolution equation, we can figure out the scale dependence of B20\n(0).\nu\u2212d\n(See the next section, for more detail.) From the predictions of the CQSM for B20\n(0)\n\ngiven in the 6th column, we have estimated the corresponding values at Q2 = 4 GeV2 . The\nresults are shown in the 7th column of Table II. For the favorable pion mass parameter\nu=d\nm\u03c0 = 100 MeV, our estimate gives B20\n(0) \u2243 0.289, which should be compared with the\nu\u2212d\ncorresponding prediction B20\n(0) = 0.274 \u00b1 0.037 of the new LHPC lattice simulation [17],\nu\u2212d\nand B20\n(0) = 0.269\u00b10.020 of the QCDSF-UKQCD one [18]. One finds that the predictions\n\nof the CQSM and those of the lattice QCD simulations are now remarkably close to each\nother. This is a welcome result, since it is thought to give a strong support to the reliability\nu\u2212d\nof the theoretical predictions on the isovector AGM of the nucleon B20\n(0).\n\nu-d\n\nm dependence of B20 (0)\n1.0\n\n0.8\n\n0.6\n\n0.4\n\n0.2\n\n0.0\n0.0\n\nCQSM\nLHPC2007\nQCDSF-UKQCD2007\nLHPC2005\nQCDSF2004\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\n1.2\n\nm [GeV]\nu\u2212d\nFIG. 1: The pion mass dependence of B20\n(0) predicted by the CQSM, in comparison with the\n\nold and new lattice QCD predictions. Both correspond to the scale Q2 \u2243 4 GeV2\nu\u2212d\nAfter obtaining a refined estimate of B20\n(0) within the framework of the CQSM, we\n\nrevise Fig.5(b) in our previous paper [27]. The filled circles in Fig.1 are the CQSM predictions\nu\u2212d\n(0) corresponding to the scale Q2 = 4 GeV2 , in dependence of the pion mass. The\nof B20\n\ncorresponding predictions of the QCDSF and LHPC collaborations carried out in the heavy\n12\n\n\fpion region several years ago are represented by the open squares and the open triangles\n[10],[15]. On the other hand, the new predictions by the LHPC and QCDSF-UKQCD\ncollaborations, extrapolated to the physical pion mass by utilizing the chiral perturbation\ntheory, are shown respectively by the open diamond and the filled triangles [17],[18]. One\nsees that effect of chiral extrapolation is drastic such that the new predictions of the lattice\nQCD are more than a factor of two smaller than the old predictions given in the heavy\npion region. This sizable reduction is just consistent with our analysis based on the CQSM\n[27]. Now, one can convince that the predictions of the CQSM and the lattice QCD for the\nu\u2212d\nisovector AGM of the nucleon B20\n(0) is mutually consistent.\n\nNext, we turn to the discussion of more difficult isoscalar quantities. As shown in [27],[28],\nthe CQSM predicts that\nu+d\nAu+d\n= 1,\n20 (0) = hxi\n\nu+d\nB20\n(0) = 0.\n\n(36)\n\nIt should be noticed that these equalities hold irrespectively of the pion mass within the\nmodel. The 1st relation is only natural. It simply means that the momentum sum rule is\nsaturated by the quark fields alone in this effective quark model, which does not contain\nexplicit gluon degrees of freedom. The 2nd relation holds by the similar reason. From Ji's\nangular momentum sum rule, we generally have (in the two flavor case)\ng\nu+d\n2 (J u+d + J g ) = hxiu+d + B20\n(0) + hxig + B20\n(0) = 1.\n\n(37)\n\nIf this is combined with the momentum sum rule of QCD,\nhxiu+d + hxig = 1,\n\n(38)\n\ng\nu+d\nB20\n(0) + B20\n(0) = 0.\n\n(39)\n\nwe are led to a novel identity,\n\nwhich dictates that the total nucleon AGM (quark plus gluon contributions) vanishes idenu+d\ntically. The answer B20\n(0) = 0 is therefore an inevitable conclusion of any effective quark\n\nmodel without gluon fields. In both of the LHPC and QCDSF lattice QCD simulations\nu+d\ncarried out in the heavy-pion region several years ago, the magnitude of B20\n(0) was found\nu+d\n(0) is equal to the difference of 2 J u+d and hxiu+d ,\nto be fairly small [11],[12]. Since B20\nu+d\nthe small values of the lattice QCD predictions for B20\n(0) at this point were interpreted to\n\n13\n\n\findicate approximate equality of the total angular momentum and linear momentum fractions of quarks and gluons as advocated by Teryaev several years ago [43]-[44]. However,\nthe recently performed ChPT fits by the LHPC and QCDSF-UKQCD Collaborations appears to indicate a sizable bending through the chiral extrapolation in the low pion mass\nu+d\nregion, leading to negative B20\n(0) of the order of \u2212 0.1, although one must be very careful\n\nabout the fact that the final conclusion depends on the ways of chiral extrapolation method\n[17],[18].\nUnder such circumstances, it would be fine if we can give some useful constraint on the\nu+d\nu+d\nmagnitude of B20\n(0). To this end, we first recall the fact that B20\n(0) is given as the 2nd\n\nmoment of the forward limit of the unpolarized spin-flip GPD E u+d (x, \u03be, t) as\nZ 1\nu+d\nB20 (0) =\nx E u+d (x, 0, 0) dx.\n\n(40)\n\n\u22121\n\nIt is important to recognize that the 1st moment of the same quantity gives the isoscalar\nmagnetic moment of the nucleon up to a factor of 3 :\nZ 1\nu+d\nB10 (0) =\nE u+d (x, 0, 0) dx = \u03bau+d = 3 (\u03bap + \u03ban ).\n\n(41)\n\n\u22121\n\nThe forward limit of the GPD E u+d (x, 0, 0) was calculated within the framework of the\nCQSM by Ossmann et al. [45]. (There is also a calculation for the forward limit of the\nisovector GPD E u\u2212d (x, 0, 0) within the CQSM [46].) It is given as a sum of the two part,\ni.e. the contribution of Nc (= 3) valence quarks and that of the vacuum-polarized Dirac-sea\nquarks as\nu+d\nu+d\nE u+d (x, 0, 0) = Eval\n(x, 0, 0) + Ev.p.\n(x, 0, 0).\n\n(42)\n\nAn interesting findings there are that the valence quark term turns out to have a similar\nu+d\nshape as the corresponding valence term fval\n(x) of the standard unpolarized PDF, while\n\nthe deformed Dirac-sea contribution has a strong chiral enhancement near x = 0, which is\nantisymmetric with respect to the transformation x \u2192 \u2212 x. (Note that the antisymmetric\nnature of the Dirac-sea contribution to E u+d (x, 0, 0) means that it gives no contribution to\nits 1st moment.) Following the schematic analysis carried out in [47] (see also [27]), we\ntherefore propose to parameterize the characteristic feature of E u+d (x, 0, 0) in the following\nsimple form :\nu+d\nE u+d (x, 0, 0) = C fval\n(x) \u2212 D \u03b4 \u2032 (x),\n\n14\n\n(43)\n\n\fwith C < 0, and D > 0. With this schematic parameterization, the 1st and the 2nd moment\nsum rules of E u+d (x, 0, 0) become\n\nZ\n\nZ\n\n1\n\nE u+d (x, 0, 0) dx = 3 C = 3 (\u03bap + \u03ban ),\nZ 1\nu+d\nu+d\nx E (x, 0, 0) dx = C\nfval\n(x) dx + D.\n\n(44)\n\n\u22121\n1\n\n\u22121\n\n(45)\n\n\u22121\n\nUsing the observed anomalous magnetic moments of the proton and the neutron, the 1st\nrelation gives\nC = (\u03bap + \u03ban )exp = \u2212 0.120.\n\n(46)\n\nOn the other hand, the 2nd relation gives\nu+d\nB20\n(0)\n\n= C\n\nZ\n\n1\n\n\u22121\n\nu+d\nfval\n(x) dx + D.\n\n(47)\n\nAs a matter of course, in the CQSM, the valence and the vacuum polarization contribuu+d\ntions in (47) exactly cancel each other so that the identity B20\n(0) = 0 holds. Such an\n\nexact cancellation may not happen in real QCD, which contains the gluon fields as well.\nNonetheless, it is reasonable to expect that the general shape of E u+d (x, 0, 0) predicted by\nthe CQSM, especially its chiral behavior observed in the small x region, would be preserved\nwhen going to real QCD, which in turn strongly indicates that there will be no change of\nu+d\n(0). We thus conjecture\nsign in the contribution of the sea-quark-like component to B20\n\nthat the coefficient D in (47) is at least larger than or equal to 0. Combining this with\nR 1 u+d\nthe fact that \u22121 fval\n(x) is smaller than 1 (this is because the sea-quark-like component\n\nalso carries some portion of the total momentum fraction of the nucleon), we would then\nu+d\nconclude from (47) that the lower limit of B20\n(0) is \u2212 0.12 ( = (\u03bap + \u03ban )exp ). In carrying\n\nout a semi-empirical analysis of the nucleon spin contents in the next section, we therefore\nu+d\ntake a standpoint that the precise value of B20\n(0) is still uncertain, but it lies most likely\n\nin the range\nu+d\n\u2212 0.12 \u2264 B20\n(0) \u2264 0.\n\n(48)\n\nThis is the main theoretical uncertainty in our semi-phenomenological analysis of the nucleon\nspin contents carried out in the next section.\n\n15\n\n\fIV.\n\nSEMI-EMPIRICAL ESTIMATE OF NUCLEON SPIN CONTENTS\n\nNow, we are ready to start our semi-empirical analysis of the nucleon spin contents. Our\nstrategy here is to use empirical information as much as possible, if available. To explain\nour approach more concretely, we start again with Ji's angular momentum sum rule written\nin a slightly more general form :\n1\n= J Q + J g,\n2\n\n(49)\n\nwith\nJ\n\nQ\n\ni\n1 h\nQ\nQ\n=\nhxi + B20 (0) ,\n2\n\nJg =\n\n1\ng\n[ hxig + B20\n(0) ] .\n2\n\n(50)\n\nHere, Q denotes the sum of all active quark flavors. (Q = u + d for the two flavor case, and\nQ = u + d + s for the three flavor case.) To carry out flavor decomposition of the total quark\nangular momentum, we also need another combination of Ji's sum rule :\nJ u\u2212d =\n\n\u0003\n1 \u0002\nu\u2212d\nhxiu\u2212d + B20\n(0) .\n2\n\n(51)\n\nWe emphasize again that the momentum fractions hxiQ , hxiu\u2212d , and hxig are all empirically\nwell determined. Naturally, these momentum fractions are all scale-dependent quantities.\nA key observation here, first made by Ji [23],[26], is that J Q and J g obey exactly the\nsame evolution equations as hxiQ and hxig do. According to him, the underlying reason is\nthat forming spatial moment of energy momentum operator does not change short distance\nsingularity of the operator. The solution of this (coupled) evolution equation is extremely\nsimple at the leading order (LO) :\n3 nf\n2 J (Q ) =\n+\n16 + 3 nf\nQ\n\n2\n\n16\n+\n2 J (Q ) =\n16 + 3 nf\ng\n\n2\n\n\u0012\n\u0012\n\nln Q20 /\u039b2\nln Q2 /\u039b2\nln Q20 /\u039b2\nln Q2 /\u039b2\n\n\u00132 (16+3 nf )/(33\u22122 nf ) \u0014\n\u00132 (16+3 nf )/(33\u22122 nf ) \u0014\n\n(Q20 )\n\n3 nf\n\u2212\n16 + 3 nf\n\n(Q20 )\n\n16\n\u2212\n16 + 3 nf\n\n2J\n\nQ\n\n2J\n\ng\n\n\u0015\n\n\u0015\n\n, (52)\n.

For the sake of completeness, we write down here the\nrelevant NLO equations, which we use in the following analysis.

Here, one might be tempted to use lattice QCD predictions for those. In our\nopinion, however, blind acceptance of the lattice QCD predictions at the present stage is\na little dangerous, especially because there seems to be large uncertainties in the process\nof chiral extrapolation. We proceed slightly more cautiously by taking account also the\ninformation from a phenomenologically successful low energy model of the nucleon, i.e. the\nCQSM.\nAfter explaining our general strategy, let us now start our semi-phenomenological analysis\nof the nucleon spin contents. We start with the empirical information obtained from the\nMRST2004 as well as the CTEQ5 fits [54],[55]. As already emphasized, these two popular\nPDF fits give almost the same quark and gluon momentum fractions below the energy scale\nQ2 \u2243 10 GeV2 , Although these PFDs are given basically above Q2 \u2243 1 GeV2 , we try to\nsee what happens if we evolve down these fits to lower energy scale as Q2 \u2243 0.30 GeV2 \u2243\n(600 MeV)2 , which is understood to be the energy scale of the CQSM. Using the known\nNLO evolution equations for hxiQ and hxig , together with the MRST2004 predictions [54],\nhxiQ \u2243 0.578,\n\nhxig \u2243 0.422 at Q2 = 4 GeV2 ,\n\n(65)\n\nwe have estimated the scale dependencies of hxiQ and hxig in the range 0.30 GeV2 \u2264 Q2 \u2264\n4 GeV2 . The result is shown in Fig.2. One sees that the scale dependencies of the quark\nand gluon momentum fractions are fairly strong below Q2 \u2243 1 GeV2 . At the low energy\nscale around Q2 \u2243 0.30 GeV2 , one finds that the momentum fraction carried by the quarks\nis nearly 80%, while that of the gluons is about 20%.\nAs a matter of course, the standard view is that the applicability range of the perturbative\nQCD is at least above 1 GeV, so that one might be a little suspicious of the physical sig18\n\n\fQ\n\nscale dependence of <x> and <x>\n\ng\n\n1.0\n0.9\n\nMRST2005\n\n0.8\nQ\n\n0.7\n\n<x>\n\n0.6\n0.5\n0.4\ng\n\n<x>\n\n0.3\n0.2\n0.1\n0.0\n0.0\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\n1.5\n\n2.0\n2\n\n2.5\n\n3.0\n\n3.5\n\n4.0\n\n2\n\nQ [GeV ]\n\nFIG. 2: The scale dependencies of the quark and gluon momentum fractions, which reproduce the\nMRST fits at Q2 = 4 GeV2 .\n\nnificance of such \"dis-evolution\" to low energy scales. Still, we believe it meaningful by the\nfollowing reason. Basically, we are following the spirit of PDF fits by Gl\u00fcck, Reya and Vogt\n[48],[49]. As is well known, these authors start the QCD evolution at the exceptionally low\nenergy scales, i.e. Q2ini \u2243 0.23 GeV2 in the leading-order (LO) case, and Q2ini \u2243 0.34 GeV2 in\nthe NLO case. They thus found that, even at such low energy scales, they absolutely need\nnonperturbatively (or dynamically) generated sea-quarks, which may be interpreted as the\neffects of meson clouds. We believe such analyses (somewhat nonstandard from the viewpoint of more conservative use of the perturbative QCD) play an important role to connect\nthe physics of nonperturbative QCD in the low energy domain and the perturbative QCD\nin the high-energy DIS domain. In fact, we have carried out several theoretical analyses\nbased on the GRV spirit. That is, we use the predictions of the CQSM for various PDFs\nas initial-scale distributions given at the low energy scale around 600 MeV. After evolving\n\n19\n\n\fthem with use of the NLO evolution equation, we compare the resultant predictions with the\ncorresponding DIS observables with a remarkable success without any other adjustable parameters [39],[40], [56]-[59]. Then, we shall continue our analysis by accepting the viewpoint\nthat the energy scale between 600MeV and 1 GeV is an important region, which connects\nthe low energy nonperturbative physics and the high energy perturbative physics of QCD.\n\nQ\n\ng\n\nscale dependence of 2 J and 2 J\n1.0\n0.9\n\nu+d\n\nB20 (0) = 0\nu+d\nB20 (0) = -0.12\n\n0.8\n0.7\n\n2J\n\nQ\n\n0.6\n0.5\n0.4\n\n2J\n\ng\n\n0.3\n0.2\n0.1\n0.0\n0.0\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\n1.5\n\n2.0\n2\n\n2.5\n\n3.0\n\n3.5\n\n4.0\n\n2\n\nQ [GeV ]\n\nFIG. 3: The scale dependencies of the quark and gluon angular momentum fractions. The solid\nu+d\nu+d\nand dashed curves respectively correspond to the choices B20\n(0) = 0 and B20\n(0) = \u2212 0.12.\n\nNow, we show in Fig.3 our estimate of the scale dependence of the total angular momentum fractions carried by the quarks and the gluons. They are obtained in the following\nway. As argued in [27], if the net quark contribution to the nucleon AGM vanishes, i.e.\nu+d\nB20\n(0) = 0, we have extremely simple proportionality relations as\n\nJQ =\n\n1\nhxiQ ,\n2\n\nJg =\n\n1\nhxig ,\n2\n\n(66)\n\nwhich was advocated by Teryaev based on the equivalence principle some years ago [42][44]. Very interestingly, these proportionality relations hold independently of the energy\n20\n\n\fscale, since (J Q , J g ) and (hxiQ , hxig ) obey the same evolution equations. Thus, the solid\ncurves in Fig.3 is nothing different from the curves for hxiQ and hxig in Fig.2. On the other\nhand, the dashed curves correspond to another extreme, which is obtained by using the value\nu+d\nu+d\nB20\n(0) = \u2212 0.12 at Q2 = 0.30 GeV2 . With this negative value of B20\n(0), 2 J Q becomes\nu+d\na little smaller and 2 J g becomes a little larger as compared with the case B20\n(0) = 0.\n\nStill, one notices that, at the scale Q2 \u2243 0.30 GeV2 , the quarks carry about 65% of the total\nangular momentum fraction. At the moment, there is a sizable ambiguity in the magnitude\nu+d\nof B20\n(0), but we believe that the truth lies between the two extreme cases illustrated in\n\nFig.3. (See the discussion at the end of the previous section.)\nNow, the net orbital angular momentum fractions carried by the quarks can be obtained\nby subtracting \u2206\u03a3 from 2 J Q . Since the prediction of the CQSM at Q2 \u2243 5 GeV2 is remarkably close to the central value \u2206\u03a3 = 0.33 of the recent HERMES analysis, we use\nthis HERMES value here. To make the discussion simple, we shall neglect here the scale\ndependence of \u2206\u03a3. (In the MS scheme at the NLO, \u2206\u03a3 is known to have a weak scale\ndependence due to the coupling with \u2206g. This scale dependence is very weak, however.)\nShown in Fig.4 are 2 LQ , \u2206\u03a3, and 2 J g as functions of Q2 . Here, the solid and dashed\nu+d\nu+d\ncurves correspond to the cases B20\n(0) = 0 and B20\n(0) = \u2212 0.12, respectively. First, let us\nu+d\nlook into the case B20\n(0) = 0. In this case, there is a cross over around Q2 \u2243 0.7 GeV2 \u2243\n\n(840 MeV)2 , where the magnitudes of 2 LQ , \u2206\u03a3, and 2 J g are all approximately equal,\n2 LQ \u2243 \u2206\u03a3 \u2243 2 J g \u2243 1/3,\n\n(67)\n\nOne sees that LQ is a rapidly decreasing function of Q2 , so that, as Q2 increases beyond this\ncross over energy scale, LQ becomes less and less important as compared with \u2206\u03a3 and J Q .\nHowever, the fact that LQ is a rapidly decreasing function below 1 GeV conversely means\nthat it must be very large at the low energy scale around 600 MeV, which we emphasize is\nqualitatively consistent with the picture of the CQSM [37],[60].\nu+d\nNext, we turn to the case B20\n(0) = \u2212 0.12. In this case, the crossover, where 2 LQ \u2243\n\n\u2206\u03a3 \u2243 2 J g \u2243 1/3, occurs around the energy scale Q2 \u2243 0.30 GeV2 . Although the role\nu+d\n(0) = 0,\nof quark OAM is less important as compared with the case corresponding to B20\n\nit still carries about 1/3 of the total nucleon spin at this low energy scale. We emphasize\nthat this is an inevitable conclusion of believing the QCD evolution equation, since it tells\nus that, at this low energy scale, the gluon (spin plus OAM) carries at most 1/3 of the total\n21\n\n\fQ\n\nscale dependence of 2 L ,\n\ng\n\n, and J\n\n0.6\nu+d\n\nB20 (0) = 0\nu+d\nB20 (0) = -0.12\n\n0.5\n\n2J\n\ng\n\n0.4\n\n0.3\n\n0.2\n\n2L\n0.1\n0.0\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\n1.5\n\n2.0\n2\n\n2.5\n\n3.0\n\nQ\n\n3.5\n\n4.0\n\n2\n\nQ [GeV ]\n\nFIG. 4: The scale dependencies of the total angular momentum and orbital angular momentum\nof quarks, together with the net longitudinal polarization of quarks. The solid and dashed curves\nu+d\nu+d\nrespectively correspond to the choices B20\n(0) = 0 and B20\n(0) = \u2212 0.12\n\nnucleon spin, so that what remains to carry the rest 1/3 of the nucleon spin must be the\nquark OAM. On the other hand, when going to higher energy scale, say at Q2 \u2243 4 GeV2 ,\ncorresponding to the renormalization scale of the lattice QCD calculations, one sees that the\namount of the quark OAM becomes much smaller. Still, it is seen to carry nearly 20% of\nthe total nucleon spin even at Q2 \u2243 4 GeV2 . One might suspect that this would contradict\nthe conclusion of the lattice QCD analyses. Probably, the main cause of discrepancy can\nbe traced back to a little overestimation of the net quark polarization \u2206\u03a3 in the lattice\nQCD. In fact, the results of the QCDSF-UKQCD group for \u2206\u03a3 is 0.402 \u00b1 0.024 [18], which\noverestimate a little the central value 0.33 of the HERMES analysis [9], which we have used\nin our semi-empirical analysis here. (One of the reason of a little overestimation of \u2206\u03a3 in\nthe lattice QCD simulations may be attributed to the so-called quenched approximation,\ni.e. the neglect of the disconnected diagrams.) In our opinion, the quark OAM fraction of\n22\n\n\fthe order of 20% is reasonable enough from the following simple consideration. To convince\nit, we recall that the asymptotic value (the value in the Q2 \u2192 \u221e limit) of the total angular\nmomentum fractions of the quarks and the gluons are extracted from the relations (52) and\n(53), which follows from the fact that (J Q , J g ) and (hxiQ , hxig ) obey the same evolution\nequation. With the realistic case of 6 flavors, we have\n2 J Q (\u221e) \u2243 0.529,\n\n2 J g (\u221e) \u2243 0.471.\n\n(68)\n\nSubtracting \u2206\u03a3 \u2243 0.33, which is thought to be nearly scale-independent, we thus obtain\n2 LQ (\u221e) \u2243 0.199.\n\n(69)\n\nSince LQ is a decreasing function of Q2 , the magnitude of 2 LQ at the scale Q2 \u2243 4 GeV2\nmust be larger or at least approximately equal to this asymptotic value, which justifies our\nreasoning above.\nSo far, we have concentrated on the analysis of the net quark and gluon contribution to\nthe nucleon spin and the net quark contribution to the orbital angular momentum. Now,\nwe try to make a flavor decomposition of the quark contribution to the nucleon spin and\nu\u2212d\norbital angular momentum, which requires the knowledge of the quantity B20\n(0), i.e. the\n\nisovector nucleon AGM. Since we want to investigate the scale dependencies of the momentum fractions and the total angular momenta of the quarks and gluons up to Q2 = 4 GeV2 ,\nwe use again the NLO evolution equation with 3 active flavors, although we assume that\nthe strange quarks carry negligible momentum fraction and AGM at the initial low energy\nscale, for simplicity. As initial conditions of evolution, we need the following quantities at\nQ2 = 0.30 GeV2 :\nhxi(0) = hxiu+d+s \u2261 hxiQ ,\nhxi(3) = hxiu\u2212d ,\n\nhxig ,\n\nhxi(8) = hxiu+d\u22122s .\n\n(70)\n(71)\n\nThe singlet moments hxiQ and hxig evolve according to the evolution equation (57). Here,\nwe use the initial condition\nhxiu+d = 0.785,\n\nhxiu\u2212d = 0.250,\n\nhxig = 0.215,\n\n(72)\n\nwith hxis = 0, since it gives at Q2 = 4 GeV2\nhxiu+d+s = 0.579,\nhxiu+d = 0.552,\n23\n\nhxig = 0.421,\n\n(73)\n\nhxiu\u2212d = 0.158,\n\n(74)\n\n\fwhich approximately reproduces the empirical MRST2004 fit at the same scale [54]. We\ncan make a similar analysis also for the total angular momentum of the quarks and gluons,\nbecause they obey the same evolution equations as the corresponding momentum fractions.\nTo proceed, we need initial conditions for the following quantities\n1\nu+d\n[hxiu+d + B20\n(0)],\n2\n1\nu\u2212d\nJ u\u2212d = [hxiu\u2212d + B20\n(0)],\n2\n1\ng\n(0)],\nJ g = [hxig + B20\n2\n\nJ u+d =\n\ng\nu+d\nwith the general constraint B20\n(0)+B20\n(0) = 0. Here, we have assumed Js = 0 at the initial\nu+d\nu+d\nu+d\nscale. For B20\n(0), we consider the two cases again, i.e B20\n(0) = 0 and B20\n(0) = \u2212 0.12.\nu\u2212d\nFor B20\n(0), we use the prediction of the CQSM given by\nu\u2212d\nB20\n(0) = 0.458.\n\n(75)\n\nAt first sight, the magnitude of the isovector AGM above seems to be fairly larger than the\ncorresponding predictions of the lattice QCD given at Q2 = 4 GeV2 . As already mentioned\nin the previous section, however, after taking account of the scale dependence, we find that\nu\u2212d\nthe above CQSM prediction for B20\n(0) is remarkably close to that of the lattice QCD.\n\nNow that all the necessary conditions are given at the initial scale Q2 = 0.30 GeV2 ,\nlet us first try to estimate the total angular momentum fractions at Q2 = 4 GeV2 , which\ncorresponds to the renormalization scale of lattice QCD simulations. First, we show the\nu+d\nresults corresponding to the choice B20\n(0) = 0. We have, at Q2 = 4 GeV2 ,\n\nhxiQ = 0.579,\nhxiu+d = 0.552,\n\nhxig = 0.421,\nhxiu\u2212d = 0.158,\n\n(76)\nhxis = 0.028,\n\n(77)\n\nand\n2 J Q = 0.579,\n2 J u+d = 0.552,\n\n2 J g = 0.421,\n2J u\u2212d = 0.448,\n\n(78)\n2 J s = 0.028,\n\n(79)\n\nwhich gives\n2 J u \u2243 0.500,\n\n24\n\n2 J d \u2243 0.052.\n\n(80)\n\n\fu+d\nOn the other hand, with the choice B20\n(0) = \u22120.12 at the initial energy scale, we get\n\n2 J Q = 0.519,\n2 J u+d = 0.486,\n\n2 J g = 0.481\n2 J u\u2212d = 0.448,\n\n(81)\n2 J s = 0.033,\n\n(82)\n\nwhich gives\n2 J u \u2243 0.467,\n\n2 J d \u2243 0.019\n\n(83)\n\nu+d\nu+d\nu+d\nDepending on the two choices for B20\n(0). i.e. B20\n(0) \u2243 \u22120.12 or B20\n(0) = 0, we thus\n\nobtain an estimate,\n2 J u \u2243 0.46 \u2212 0.50,\n\n2 J d \u2243 0.02 \u2212 0.05,\n\n(84)\n\nwhich supports the conclusion of the lattice QCD studies that the total angular momentum\ncarried by the d-quarks is nearly zero at least qualitatively. For reference, we show in Fig.5\nthe predicted scale dependence of J u and J d .\nNow, the information on the quark OAM can be obtained from J u , J d and J s by subtracting the corresponding intrinsic spin contributions. Here, we use the empirical information\nprovided by the recent HERMES analysis [9], which gives at Q2 = 5 GeV2 ,\n(0)\n\n(85)\n\n(3)\n\n(86)\n\n(8)\n\n(87)\n\ngA \u2261 \u2206\u03a3u+d+s = 0.330 \u00b1 0.011(theor.) \u00b1 0.025(exp.) \u00b1 0.028(evol.),\ngA \u2261 \u2206\u03a3u\u2212d = 1.269 \u00b1 0.003,\ngA \u2261 \u2206\u03a3u+d\u22122s = 0.586 \u00b1 0.031,\nNeglecting the error-bars, for simplicity, this gives\n\u2206\u03a3u = 0.842,\n\n\u2206\u03a3d = \u2212 0.427,\n\n\u2206\u03a3s = \u2212 0.085.\n\n(88)\n(3)\n\n(8)\n\nAs is well known, due to the conservation of the flavor nonsinglet axial-current, gA and gA\n(0)\n\nare exactly scale independent. Then, if we neglect very weak scale-dependence of gA , all\nof \u2206\u03a3u , \u2206\u03a3d and \u2206\u03a3s are thought to be scale independent. Let us first estimate the quark\nu+d\nu+d\nOAM at Q2 = 4 GeV2 . Depending on the two choices for B20\n(0), i.e. B20\n(0) = \u2212 0.12\nu+d\nand B20\n(0) = 0, we obtain\n\n2Lu = \u2212 (0.333 \u2212 0.300),\n\n2Ld = 0.489 \u2212 0.522,\n\n2Ls = 0.033 \u2212 0.028.\n\n(89)\n\nA prominent feature here is that the magnitudes of Lu and Ld are sizably large with the\nopposite sign such that Lu < 0 and Ld > 0, which leads to the inequality\n|Lu+d | \u226a |Lu\u2212d |,\n25\n\n(90)\n\n\fu\n\nscale dependence of 2 J and 2 J\n\nd\n\n1.0\nu+d\n\nB20 (0) = 0\nu+d\nB20 (0) = -0.12\n\n0.8\n\n0.6\n\n0.4\n\n2J\n\nu\n\n0.2\n\n0.0\n\n2J\n\nd\n\n-0.2\n\n-0.4\n0.0\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\n1.5\n\n2.0\n2\n\n2.5\n\n3.0\n\n3.5\n\n4.0\n\n2\n\nQ [GeV ]\n\nFIG. 5: The scale dependencies of J u and J d .

(As already discussed, the cancellation\nbetween Lu and Ld is not so perfect in our semi-phenomenological analysis as compared\nwith the lattice QCD predictions.) To understand the physical meaning of the above unique\nfeature, we find it instructive to look into the scale dependence of Lu\u2212d as well as of Lu and\nLd .\nShown in Fig.6 are scale dependencies of 2Lu , 2Ld , and 2Lu\u2212d . (Note that the differu+d\nence Lu\u2212d of Lu and Ld does not depend on the choice of B20\n(0).) One clearly sees that\n\nLu\u2212d is a decreasing function of Q2 . Since Lu\u2212d is negative, this means that |Lu\u2212d | is an\nincreasing function of Q2 . Actually, this somewhat peculiar behavior of Lu\u2212d can naturally\nbe understood from the definitional equation of quark OAM :\n2 Lu\u2212d (Q2 ) \u2261 2 J u\u2212d (Q2 ) \u2212 \u2206\u03a3u\u2212d .\n\n(91)\n\nSince J u\u2212d (Q2 ) is a decreasing function of Q2 , while \u2206\u03a3u\u2212d is Q2 -independent, Lu\u2212d (Q2 )\n26\n\n\fu\n\nd\n\nscale dependence of 2 L ,2 L and 2 L\n\nu-d\n\n1.0\nu+d\n\nB20 (0) = 0\nu+d\nB20 (0) = -0.12\n\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n\n2L\n\nd\n\n0.2\n0.0\n\n2L\n\n-0.2\n\nu\n\n-0.4\n-0.6\n\n2L\n\nu-d\n\n-0.8\n-1.0\n0.0\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\n1.5\n\n2.0\n2\n\n2.5\n\n3.0\n\n3.5\n\n4.0\n\n2\n\nQ [GeV ]\n\nFIG. 6: The scale dependencies of Lu and Ld as well as Lu\u2212d . The solid and dashed curves\nu+d\nu+d\nrespectively correspond to the choices B20\n(0) = 0 and B20\n(0) = \u2212 0.12\n\nis a decreasing function of Q2 . In particular, since 2J u\u2212d (\u221e) = 0, as verified from the\nnon-singlet (NS) evolution equation (63), one finds that the isovector quark OAM in the\nasymptotic limit Q2 \u2192 \u221e is solely determined by the isovector axial-charge of the nucleon\n(I=1)\n\ngA\n\n\u2261 \u2206\u03a3u\u2212d as\n(I=1)\n\n2 Lu\u2212d (\u221e) = \u2212 gA\n\n= \u2212 1.269.\n\n(92)\n\nThis is really an astonishing observation, since it means that the quark OAM in the asymptotic limit, at least its isovector combination, is determined solely by the longitudinal\nquark polarization ! Note that, since there is no room for doubt in using the relation\nLq = J q \u2212 12 \u2206\u03a3q to extract quark OAM, this mysterious conclusion is an inevitable consequence of the following two theoretical postulates :\n\u2022 the definition of J q through Ji's angular momentum sum rule, J q =\n\u2022 the observation that J q and hxiq obey the same evolution equation.\n27\n\n1\n2\n\nq\n[hxiq + B20\n(0)].\n\n\fAnyhow, since the net quark OAM 2Lu+d (Q2 ) is a rapidly decreasing function of Q2 , we\ncan easily understand the feature that Lu is large and negative, while Ld is large and positive\nabove a few GeV scale. It is an interesting open question whether such a large OAM of the\nu- and d-quarks with opposite sign can be verified through some direct measurements like\nthe single-spin asymmetry of semi-inclusive reactions depending on the Sivers mechanism\n[19], which is believed to be sensitive to the OAM of nucleon constituents.\nNow, we attempt to give a complete solution to our first question, i.e. the problem of\ndetermining the full spin contents of the nucleon. Our answer on the decomposition of\nthe nucleon spin into the sum of LQ ,\n\n1\n2\n\n\u2206\u03a3, and J g is already given in Fig.4 within the\n\nrange 0.30 GeV2 . Q2 . 4.0 GeV2 . Still, uncompleted is further decomposition of J g into\nthe sum of \u2206g and Lg . Unfortunately, this decomposition is not gauge invariant and it\ncannot be done very reliably as compared with the analysis done so far. Still, the following\nqualitative consideration would be of some help to have a rough idea about the complete\ndecomposition of the nucleon spin, thereby clarifying the fairly confused situation pointed\nout in Introduction. A basis of the following analysis is the observation that the gluon\npolarization in the nucleon cannot be very large at least at the low renormalization scales\n[7],[8] and HERMES groups [9]. As a simplest trial, we therefore assume that the gluon\npolarization \u2206g is zero, at the low energy model scale around Q2 = 0.3 GeV2 . Combining\nthis with the CQSM prediction \u2206\u03a3 = 0.35 for the net quark longitudinal polarization, we\nsolve the NLO evolution equation for \u2206\u03a3 and \u2206g in the standard MS factorization scheme.\nThe resultant \u2206\u03a3 and \u2206g as functions of Q2 are illustrated in Fig.7 together with the\nempirical values obtained in the recent NLO analyses by the COMPASS and the HERMES\ngroups [7]-[9], as well as the old SMC fit [61]. As repeatedly emphasized, the new COMPASS\nand the HERMES results for \u2206\u03a3 are remarkably close to the prediction of the CQSM. Also\nnoteworthy here is the strong scale dependence of the longitudinal gluon polarization. In\nspite that we have assumed that \u2206g is zero at the starting energy scale, it grows rapidly\nwith increasing Q2 . As nicely explained in [62], the growth of the gluon polarization with\n(0)1\n\nQ2 can be traced back to the positive sign of the relevant anomalous dimension \u03b4\u03b3qg . The\npositivity of this quantity dictates that the polarized quark is preferred to radiate a gluon\nwith helicity parallel to the quark polarization. Since the net quark spin component in\nthe proton is clearly positive, it follows that \u2206g > 0 at least for the gluon perturbatively\nradiated from the quarks. The growth rate of \u2206g is so fast especially in the relatively low\n28\n\n\fscale dependence of\n\nand\n\ng\n\n0.8\n\n0.6\n\ng\nCOMPASS\n\n0.4\n\nHERMES\n\nSMC\n\n0.2\n\n0.0\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n2\n\n10\n\n12\n\n14\n\n16\n\n2\n\nQ [GeV ]\nFIG. 7: The scale dependencies of \u2206\u03a3 and \u2206g, obtained as explained in the text, are compared\nwith the recent QCD fits by the COMPASS group (open circle and open triangle) and by the\nHERMES group (filled circle). The old SMC result is also shown for reference by the filled square.\n\nQ2 region that its magnitude reaches around (0.3 \u2212 0.4) already at Q2 = 3 GeV2 , which may\nbe compared with the estimate given by the COMPASS group :\n\u2206g(Q2 = 3 GeV2 )COM P ASS \u2243 (0.2 \u2212 0.3).\n\n(93)\n\nIt should be emphasized that the gluon polarization of this size is nothing inconsistent with\nthe GRSV standard scenario of the polarized PDF fit [63]. (Almost the same viewpoint was\nemphasized also in a recent bag model study of the gluon polarization [64].) Let us therefore\nproceed further by assuming that our estimate of \u2206g shown in Fig.7 is not extremely far\nfrom the reality, which enables us to carry out a decomposition of J g into \u2206g and Lg .\nFig.8 shows the gluon OAM Lg obtained in the above way, together with 2 J g and 2 \u2206g.\nOne sees that the gluon OAM Lg is a rapidly decreasing function of Q2 . This feature\nnaturally follows since Lg = J g \u2212 \u2206g and the increasing rate of \u2206g is much faster than\nthat of J g . Very interestingly, the magnitude of Lg in the vicinity Q2 \u2243 1 GeV2 turns out\n29\n\n\fg\n\nscale dependence of 2 L , 2\n\ng and 2 J\n\ng\n\n1.0\nu+d\n\n2\n\nB20 (0) = 0\nu+d\nB20 (0) = -0.12\n\n0.8\n\ng\n\n0.6\n0.4\n\n2J\n\ng\n\n0.2\n0.0\n-0.2\n-0.4\n-0.6\n0.0\n\n2L\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\n1.5\n\n2.0\n2\n\n2.5\n\n3.0\n\ng\n\n3.5\n\n4.0\n\n2\n\nQ [GeV ]\n\nFIG. 8: The spin and OAM decomposition of gluon total angular momentum as a function of Q2 .\n\nto be fairly close to zero. We are not sure whether this can be interpreted as giving a\nsupport to Brodsky and Gardner's interpretation of the recent COMPASS observation of\nsmall single-spin asymmetry on the isoscalar deuteron target.\nAnyhow, keeping in mind that the spin decomposition of the nucleon is highly scale\ndependent, our estimate at the scale Q2 \u2243 4 GeV2 can be summarized as follows. The net\nangular momentum fractions carries by the quarks and the gluons are 2 J Q \u2243 0.52 \u2212 0.58\nand 2 J g \u2243 0.42 \u2212 0.48. The total angular momentum carried by the quarks can further\nbe decomposed into the spin and OAM parts as \u2206\u03a3 \u2243 0.33 and 2 LQ \u2243 0.19 \u2212 0.25. The\ndecomposition of J g into the sum of \u2206g and Lg is still very ambiguous. But, the standard\nscenario for the evolution of \u2206g indicates that the gluon total angular momentum of the\norder of 2 J g \u2243 0.42\u22120.48 is a consequence of the cancellation of relatively large and positive\n\u2206g and negative gluon OAM with a little smaller magnitude.\nFinally, we make a short comment on the recent extraction of the quark total angular\n\n30\n\n\fmomentum through the model-dependent GPD analyses of the semi-inclusive reactions. The\nfirst experimental result for the quark angular momentum was obtained by the HERMES\nCollaboration by studying the hard exclusive \u03c0 0 production on the transversely polarized\nhydrogen target [65]. Their results, corresponding to the average energy scale Q2 \u2243 2.5 GeV2 ,\nis given by [66],[67]\nJ u + J d /2.9 = 0.42 \u00b1 0.21 \u00b1 0.06.\n\n(94)\n\nOn the other hand, another combination of J u and J d was extracted by the JLab Hall A\nCollaboration through the analysis of the DVCS and the Bethe-Heitler processes on the\nneutron and on the deuteron target [68]. Their result, corresponding to the average energy\nscale Q2 \u2243 1.9 GeV2 , is given by\nJ d + J u /5.0 = 0.18 \u00b1 0.14.\n\n(95)\n\nFor reference, we show below the corresponding predictions of our semi-phenomenological\nu+d\nu+d\nanalysis. Depending on the two choices B20\n(0) = \u2212 0.12 and B20\n(0) = 0, we obtain\n\nJ u + J d /2.9 = (0.245 \u2212 0.268),\n\nQ2 = 2.5 GeV2 ,\n\n(96)\n\nJ d + J u /5.0 = (0.056 \u2212 0.078),\n\nQ2 = 1.9 GeV2 .\n\n(97)\n\nand\n\nClearly, our estimates lie in the allowed ranges of both the HERMES and JLab determinations of J u and J d . However, it is also clear that the error-bars of the two determinations\nare still too large to be able to say something definite.\n\nV.\n\nCONCLUDING REMARKS\n\nAfter completing our semi-empirical analysis of the nucleon spin contents, we now try to\nanswer several questions raised in Introduction. Accepting the observation that the intrinsic\nquark spin carries about 1/3 of the total nucleon spin, what carry the rest of it ? As we\nhave shown, the answer depends on the scale of observation in an essential manner. At\nthe relatively high energy scale around Q2 \u2243 4 GeV2 , corresponding to the renormalization\nscale of the recent lattice QCD simulations, the quarks and gluons respectively carry about\n(52 \u2212 58) % and (0.42 \u2212 0.48) % of the total nucleon spin. The total angular momentum\nfraction 2 J Q carried by the quarks can further be decomposed into the spin and OAM\n31\n\n\fparts as \u2206\u03a3 \u2243 0.33 and 2 LQ \u2243 0.19 \u2212 0.25. Our estimate for the quark OAM appears to\ncontradict the conclusion of the lattice QCD studies that the OAM carried the quarks is\nnearly zero. The cause of discrepancy can mainly be traced back to a little overestimation\nof the net longitudinal quark polarization \u2206\u03a3 in the lattice QCD simulation. In fact, once\nwe accept to use the central value \u2206\u03a3 = 0.33 given by the recent HERMES fit, the quark\nOAM of the order of 20% at Q2 \u2243 4 GeV2 is nothing unreasonable as can be convinced from\nthe following two observations made based on the evolution equations of relevant quantities.\nThe one is the fact that the asymptotic (Q2 \u2192 \u221e) value of the net quark OAM fraction\nis given by 2 LQ (\u221e) = 2 J Q (\u221e) \u2212 \u2206\u03a3 \u2243 0.529 \u2212 0.33 \u2243 0.199 for nf = 6. The other is\nthe fact that LQ is a decreasing function of Q2 . The decomposition of J g into the sum of\nthe spin and the OAM parts is still very ambiguous. Nonetheless, the standard scenario\nfor the evolution of \u2206g strongly indicates that the total gluon angular momentum of the\norder 2 J g = 0.42 \u2212 0.48 at Q2 = 4 GeV2 is likely to be a consequence of the cancellation of\nrelatively large and positive \u2206g and negative gluon OAM with a little smaller magnitude.\nAt the low energy scales of nonperturbative QCD around Q2 \u2243 (0.30 \u2212 0.70) GeV2 , we\nget a very different picture on the nucleon spin contents. In these energy scales, the quark\nOAM, the intrinsic quark spin, and the gluon total angular momentum would give roughly\nthe same magnitude of contributions to the nucleon spin, i.e. 2 LQ \u2243 \u2206\u03a3 \u2243 2 J g \u2243 1/3.\nAlso very interesting is the flavor decomposition of the total angular momentum and the\nOAM carried by the quarks. On the basis of Ji's observation that J q and hxiq obey the\nsame evolution equation, we have shown that the asymptotic limit of the isovector quark\nOAM is solely determined by the isovector axial-charge of the nucleon or the isovector part\n(I=1)\n\nof the longitudinal quark polarization as 2 Lu\u2212d (\u221e) = \u2212 gA\n\n= \u2212\u2206\u03a3u\u2212d = \u2212 1.269, which\n\nleads to novel isovector dominance of the quark OAM at the high energy scale. It is an\ninteresting open question whether this unique feature of the quark OAM at high Q2 can be\nprobed through some direct observations in high energy DIS processes.\n\n32\n\n\fAcknowledgments\n\nThis work is supported in part by a Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research from Ministry\nof Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (No. C-16540253)\n\n[1] EMC Collaboration : J.
