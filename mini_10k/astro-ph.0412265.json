While none of these stars show excesses\nat 24 \u03bcm, we have detected 70 \u03bcm excesses around 6 stars at the 3-\u03c3 confidence\nlevel. The excesses are produced by cool material (< 100 K) located beyond 10\nAU, well outside the \"habitable zones\" of these systems and consistent with the\npresence of Kuiper Belt analogues with \u223c100 times more emitting surface area\nthan in our own planetary system. These planet-bearing stars are, by selection\nfor RV studies, typically older than 1 Gyr, and the stars identified here with\nexcesses have a median age of 4 Gyr. We find a preliminary correlation of both\nthe frequency and the magnitude of dust emission with the presence of known\nplanets. These are the first stars outside the solar system identified as having\nboth well-confirmed planetary systems and well-confirmed IR excesses.\nSubject headings: infrared:stars; Kuiper Belt; planetary systems:formation; planetary systems:protoplanetary disks\n\n1.\n\nIntroduction\n\nFirst discovered by the Infrared Astronomical Satellite (IRAS), the \"Vega phenomenon\"\nis characterized by a significant deviation from the expected Rayleigh-Jeans emission of\nquiescent main-sequence stars (Aumann & Good 1990; Gillett 1986). The excess IR emission\nfrom other stars has been attributed to dust orbiting at distances anywhere from less than 1\n\n\f\u20132\u2013\nto more than 100 AU, analogous to the zodiacal cloud and the Kuiper belt in our own solar\nsystem. Due to effects such as radiation pressure and Poynting-Robertson drag, the lifetime\nof the dust is generally much shorter than the age of the system; any dust observed must\nhave been recently produced. In the solar system, dust is generated by collisions between\nlarger bodies in the asteroid and Kuiper belts, as well as from outgassing comets. Extrasolar\nsystems with IR excess presumably have their own supply of large, solid planetesimals and,\nperhaps, large planets like those in our system.\nIRAS found that approximately 15% of main-sequence stars (Plets & Vynckier 1999),\npredominantly A and F stars, show excesses attributable to dust in orbit around the stars\nat distances between a few and a few hundred AU and heated by absorbed starlight to\ntemperatures of 30-300 K (Backman & Paresce 1993). Fractional luminosities, Ldust /L\u22c6 , are\nobserved as large as 10\u22123 for stars with bright excesses such as \u03b2 Pic and as small as 10\u22125\nfor stars at the detection threshold. These values can be compared to our solar system: 10\u22128\nto 10\u22127 for the hot material in the zodiacal cloud (1-3 AU; Dermott et al. 2002) and 10\u22127\nto 10\u22126 predicted for the cooler Kuiper Belt region beyond 10 AU (Stern 1996), which is\nconstrained to be < 10\u22125 by IRAS (Aumann & Good 1990; Teplitz et al. 1999). Observations\nby the Infrared Space Observatory (ISO; Habing et al. 2001; Spangler et al. 2001) suggest a\ndecline in the fraction of stars with excess IR emission with time, but with the possibility\nof finding modest (Ldust /L\u22c6 > 10\u22125 ) excesses among older stars (Decin et al. 2000, 2003).\nSpitzer and IRAS results toward more than 200 A stars confirm a general decline in the\naverage amount of emission with little 24 \u03bcm emission seen for sources older than 100 Myr\nbut with large variations within each age group studied (Rieke et al. 2004). The variations\nare probably due in part to sporadic replenishment of dust clouds by individual collisions\nbetween large, solid bodies, but also are likely to reflect a range in mass and extent for the\ninitial planetesimal disk.\nImages in the optical and near-IR (Heap et al. 2000; Schneider et al. 1999), submillimeter (Holland et al. 1998; Greaves et al. 1998; Holland et al. 2003) and from Spitzer itself\n(Stapelfeldt et al. 2004) have revealed that in some cases the dust exists in flattened disks\nwith warps, gaps, and blob-like structures that have been attributed to the gravitational\ninfluence of planets (Wyatt & Dent 2002; Dermott et al. 2002). Still, while the frequency\nand magnitude of IR excess are strongly correlated with stellar youth, no such correlation\nhas yet been found between IR excess and the presence of planets. Even before the first\nconfirmed discovery of an extrasolar planet orbiting a Sun-like star (51 Peg b; Mayor &\nQueloz 1995; Marcy & Butler 1995), attempts had been made to find links between planets\nand dusty debris around other stars (e.g. \u01eb Eri; Backman & Paresce 1993). While early\nradial-velocity searches for planets found a planet-like trend for \u01eb Eridani (Campbell et al.\n1988), the candidate planet remains controversial even today due to the extremely high level\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\nof chromospheric activity on this young star. The 7-year periodicity found in the star's radial\nvelocity (Campbell et al. 1988; Cumming et al. 1999; Hatzes et al. 2000) may be induced by a\nplanet orbiting at several AU (Hatzes et al. 2000) or may instead be a reflection of the star's\npoorly understood magnetic cycle. Conversely, 55 Cnc has a well-known planetary system,\nbut claims of a dust disk based on visible imaging (Trilling et al. 2000) and ISO photometry\n(Dominik et al. 1998) have been ruled out by HST coronography (Schneider et al. 2001), submillimeter mapping (Jayawardhana et al. 2002), and Spitzer/MIPS measurements presented\nhere. In spite of the many studies specifically designed to find a connection between dust\nand planets, no systems with both well-confirmed planets and well-confirmed IR excess have\nyet been observed. In fact, the data to date appear to indicate an anti-correlation between\ndust and planets (Greaves et al. 2004).\nThe longstanding assumption that stars besides the Sun might harbor both planets\nand extended dust emission has still not been verified. The aim of this paper is to use the\nMultiband Imaging Photometer on the Spitzer Space Telescope (MIPS; Rieke et al. 2004)\nto directly address this outstanding issue by searching for excess IR emission from known\nplanet-bearing stars. MIPS provides unprecedented sensitivity at mid-IR wavelengths and\nas such is an ideal instrument for searching for the dust emission from solar-type stars.\nWhile the focus of this paper is on observations of stars which are known to have planets,\nfor purposes of noise calibration and to greatly improve our statistical analysis, the results\nfor planet-bearing stars are considered within the context of a larger program - the Volume\nLimited Survey (VLS). VLS is a Spitzer GTO program designed to search for excesses around\na broad sample of 155 nearby, F5-K5 main-sequence field stars, sampling wavelengths from\n8-40 \u03bcm with IRS and 24 & 70 \u03bcm with MIPS. This survey consists of two components\n- stars with planets and those without. The stars without known planets represent a true\nvolume-limited sample selected for expected 70 \u03bcm brightness and low levels of infrared\ncirrus. The sample includes G and late F stars out to 25 pc and early K stars out to 15 pc.\nThis component of VLS consists of 114 stars (without planets), 58 of which have already\nbeen observed. These stars will be discussed in more detail in a separate paper (Bryden et\nal. 2005); here we focus on the second component of the VLS program - planet-bearing stars.\nThe planet-bearing sample was selected from a group of stars of similar spectral types known\nto have RV planets. Of 41 planned targets, 26 have been observed to date. These stars are\nnot necessarily located in regions of low infrared cirrus and are typically farther away (\u223c1550 pc) than the non-planet VLS sample. It is worth noting that the disk around \u01eb Eri, a K0\nstar located 3.3 pc away, would have been undetectable by IRAS if that star were located\neven 10 pc away; its 60 \u03bcm flux density would then have dropped below the completeness\nlimit of the Faint Source Catalog (Moshir et al. 1990). The sensitivity of Spitzer/MIPS\nallows the search for disks not just around the nearest FGK stars, but also around those\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\nlocated at distances of 10-50 pc around which planets have been identified.\nWe present our MIPS observation in \u00a72, along with a full error analysis to determine\nwhether any measured excesses are statistically significant. For the systems with IR excess,\n\u00a73 attempts to find a correlation with system parameters such as stellar metallicity/age\nor planet mass/semi-major axis. Before the concluding remarks (\u00a75), we describe how our\nMIPS observations constrain the dust properties in each system (\u00a74).\n\n2.\n\nObservations\n\nDuring its first year of operation Spitzer observed from the VLS sample 26 stars with\nRV planets (Table 1) and an additional 58 stars without any known planets. All stars were\nobserved at 70 \u03bcm. One planet-bearing star, HD128311, was not observed at 24 \u03bcm due to\nscheduling constraints, but its spectrum at this wavelength was measured with IRS LongLow and was found to be consistent with no excess shortward of 30 \u03bcm. The remainder of\nthe planet-bearing stars were observed at 24 \u03bcm and detected with high signal-to-noise ratio\n(SNR).\n\n2.1.\n\nData Reduction\n\nOur data reduction is based on the DAT software developed by the MIPS instrument\nteam (Gordon et al. 2004a). Because the data pipeline is still under development and the\nadopted calibration numbers are likely to change with further improvements in the overall\nMIPS data analysis, we list our chosen set of data reduction parameters in detail.\nFor each of the 24 \u03bcm and 70 \u03bcm bands, the instrument calibration was derived from\n\u223c75 observations of \u223c35 different stars. To minimize systematic uncertainties, a mix of\nstellar types was used: most of the calibrators are K giants, several are A stars, and a few\nare solar analogs. The 24 \u03bcm photosphere predictions were derived from stellar templates\n(e.g. Cohen et al. 1999) for K giants, from Kurucz models (e.g. Kurucz 2003) for A stars,\nand from the solar spectrum (e.g. Tobiska et al. 2000) for the solar analogs. The 70 \u03bcm\nphotospheric predictions were obtained similarly, except that the analytic spectral functions\nof Engelke (1992) were used to extrapolate the K giant templates out to 70 \u03bcm.\nAt 24 \u03bcm, we carried out aperture photometry on reduced images using an aperture 6\ncamera pixels (1 pixel=2.5\u2032\u2032 at 24 \u03bcm) in radius, a background annulus from 12 to 17 pixels,\nand an aperture correction of 1.15. The flux level is calibrated at 1.047 \u03bcJy/arcsec2 /(DN/s),\nwith a default color correction of 1.00 appropriate for sources warmer than 4000 K at a\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\nweighted-average wavelength of 23.68 \u03bcm. Final images were mosaiced from individual\nframes with quarter-pixel subsampling.\nAt 70 \u03bcm we used images processed beyond the standard DAT software in order to correct for time-dependent transients, corrections which can significantly improve the sensitivity\nof the measurements (Gordon et al. 2004b). At 24 \u03bcm, a large enough aperture was chosen\nso as to integrate all of the flux out to roughly the first Airy ring. Because the accuracy of\nthe 70 \u03bcm data is limited by background noise, rather than instrumental effects, such a large\naperture contains an undesirable amount of sky fluctuations. In order to maximize signal-tonoise, a smaller aperture is more appropriate at 70 \u03bcm - just 1.5 pixels in radius. With a 4 to\n8 pixel radius sky annulus, this aperture size requires a relatively high aperture correction of\n1.79. The flux level is calibrated at 15,800 \u03bcJy/arcsec2 /MIPS 70 unit, again with a default\ncolor correction of 1.00 (MIPS 70 units are based on the ratio of the measured signal to the\nstimulator flash signal). Images were mosaiced from individual frames with half-pixel subsampling. For both the 24 \u03bcm and 70 \u03bcm data, neighboring point sources were subtracted\nfrom the images before measuring the sky brightness. Also for both wavelengths, we fix\neach target's position, rather than centroid onto the peak of the local flux distribution. If\nthe target position is not fixed, the centroid position tends to float toward any local noise\nfluctuations, resulting in an inappropriately high flux measurement, particularly for noisy\nfields. The fact that no centering of the aperture is required is a reflection of the excellent\ntelescope pointing intrinsic to Spitzer (<1\u2032\u2032 ; Werner et al. 2004).\nIn order to determine whether any of our target stars have an IR excess, we compare\nthe measured photometry to predicted photospheric levels. For convenience in extrapolating\nthe photospheric emission we have fitted Kurucz models (Castelli 2003; Kurucz 2003) to a\ncombination of short wavelength data taken primarily from the Tycho/Hipparcos (visible),\nJohnson (bright near-IR) or 2MASS (faint near-IR), and IRAS (12 \u03bcm) catalogs. After\nexcluding one outlying point for a star with an excess (HD69830, which will be discussed\nelsewhere; Beichman et al. 2005), the 83 flux measurements at 24 \u03bcm have an average\nFMIPS /Fphotosphere of 0.99 which, although gratifyingly close to unity, is not surprising given\nthat the present Spitzer calibration is based on similar stellar models. More importantly for\nour purposes, the dispersion of FMIPS /Fphotosphere is 0.07 for this sample (Fig. 1).\nAt 70 \u03bcm, 73 out of 84 stars (both planet-bearing and without planets) are detected\nwith signal-to-noise ratio > 3. This is in contrast with previous IR surveys of AFGK stars\nwith ISO, in which only half of the stars without excess were detected (Habing et al. 2001).\nWhile the sensitivity of these Spitzer observations is roughly a factor of 10 better than\nprevious data, Spitzer's sensitivity is limited by extragalactic source confusion and cirrus\n(see below) which will make it difficult to look for excesses around stars much fainter than\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\nthose discussed here.\nThe distribution of 70 \u03bcm flux densities relative to the expected photospheric values is\nshown in Fig. 2. Unlike the tight distribution of flux ratios at 24 \u03bcm, several stars have 70\n\u03bcm flux much higher than expected from the stellar photosphere alone. In one case, the 70\n\u03bcm flux is high by a factor of 15. Many of the stars (12) will be identified in the following as\nhaving statistically significant IR excess. Ignoring these stars with excesses and those with\nSNR < 3, the average ratio of MIPS flux to predicted photosphere is |FMIPS /Fphotosphere | =\n1.03 \u00b1 0.04, consistent with the present calibration. More important than the absolute\ncalibration of FMIPS /Fphotosphere is its dispersion, which indicates the overall accuracy of the\nflux measurements and gives an immediate sense of the minimum level of excess necessary\nfor detection. The dispersion in the 70 \u03bcm sample is 28% (excluding the stars with excesses),\nconsiderably higher than that in the 24 \u03bcm data (7%). The following section (\u00a72.2) discusses\nin more detail the noise levels within the 70 \u03bcm data.\nFig. 3 shows the spectral energy distributions for two of the planet-bearing stars,\nHD82943 and HD117176, that have excess 70 \u03bcm emission. Published photometric fluxes\nfor these stars from visible to infrared are well fit by Kurucz stellar atmospheres (dotted\nlines; Castelli 2003; Kurucz 2003). The Spitzer/MIPS 24 \u03bcm fluxes are also well fit by the\nmodel atmospheres (within 1% for HD82943, 5% low for HD117176). The 70 \u03bcm emission,\nmeanwhile, is well above that expected from the stellar photosphere alone; an additional\ncomponent of emission due to dust must be added to the Kurucz model in order to fit the\n70 \u03bcm data. Because there is only a single 70 \u03bcm measurement of IR excess, however, the\nSED can be fit by a range of dust temperatures and luminosities. Constraints on the dust\nin these systems are discussed in \u00a74.\n\n2.2.\n\nDetection of Excess at 70 \u03bcm\n\nA potential correlation of planets with IR excess is already apparent in Fig. 2, in which\n4 of the 5 largest 70 \u03bcm flux ratios are for stars which harbor planets, even though planetbearing stars make up less than one-third of the sample. Still, without a proper analysis of\nthe noise levels in each field it is impossible to assess whether the IR excesses are statistically\nsignificant.\nIn general, the sources of noise can be divided into pixel-to-pixel noise (which we refer\nto as \"sky\" noise) and errors for the field as a whole (\"systematic\" noise). The pixel-to-pixel\nnoise is a combination of detector/photon noise along with real sky background fluctuations.\nFor the 24 \u03bcm measurements, photon noise is negligible. Even with the minimum allowed\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\nintegration time (1 cycle of 3 sec exposures = 48 sec), the sensitivity of MIPS is overwhelming;\neven our dimmest source could theoretically be detected in just a few milliseconds. Further,\nthe background noise is low: galactic cirrus is weak at this wavelength; the zodiacal emission\nis relatively smooth across the field of view; and the confusion limit for distant extragalactic\nsources is just 0.056 mJy (Dole et al. 2004b).\nInstead, for the 24 \u03bcm measurements, systematic errors dominate. The instrumental\ncontribution to these errors is thought to be very low: 24 \u03bcm observations of calibrator stars\nare stable with 1% rms deviations over several months of observations (Rieke et al. 2004).\nIn addition to any residual instrumental problems, the dispersion in FMIPS /Fphotosphere can\ninclude errors in the photosphere extrapolation and the effects of source variability. The\nfitting of the photosphere can be as precise as 2% when the best 2MASS Ks photometry is\navailable (Skrutskie et al. 2000), but for stars brighter than Ks < 6 mag, 2MASS data are less\naccurate and lower precision near-IR data and/or shorter wavelength observations must be\nused. Extrapolation from visible data places considerably more weight on the photospheric\nmodels and may result in greater uncertainty in the predicted photospheric levels at 24 \u03bcm\nand 70 \u03bcm.\nWhile the relative contributions of instrumental and fitting errors to the 24 \u03bcm dispersion are unknown, it is clear that the photometry is currently limited to 7% accuracy due\nto their combined effects. While this may improve with further instrument analysis and\nbetter photospheric models, 3-\u03c3 detections of excess at 24 \u03bcm now require measured fluxes\nat least 20% above the stellar photosphere. Only one of our sources (HD69830) meets this\nrequirement, with a strongly significant 45% excess. The relatively hot dust emission in this\nsystem, which is not yet known to have any planets, will be discussed in a separate paper\n(Beichman et al. 2005).\nAt 70 \u03bcm we planned the number of observing cycles (each with 126 sec integration time)\nso that the expected detector/photon noise would be \u223c0.1 of the stellar flux, or equivalently,\nto achieve a signal-to-noise (SNR) \u223c 10 on the stellar photosphere. Integration times range\nfrom a few minutes up to 1 hour. Within each reduced image, we estimate the sky noise\nby directly measuring the standard deviation in the background flux when convolved with\nour chosen aperture size. Based on this measured sky noise, we find a median SNR of \u223c6,\nexcluding the sources identified as having an excess. This noise estimate, however, includes\ncontributions beyond just detector/photon noise. Unlike at 24 \u03bcm, the fluctuations in the\nbackground at 70 \u03bcm can be significant. This background, a combination of galactic cirrus\nand extragalactic confusion, creates a noise floor for each field which cannot be improved\nwith increased integration time. To try to minimize this problem, the target stars in the\nVolume Limited Sample came from areas of low galactic cirrus, as estimated from the IRAS\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\nSky Survey Atlas (IPAC 1994). The confusion limit for extragalactic background sources,\nhowever, is unavoidable and sets a strict lower limit for the sky noise at 70 \u03bcm. Dole et al.\n(2004b) find a 5-\u03c3 confusion limit of 3.2 mJy based on source counts from Spitzer (Dole\net al. 2004a) extrapolated to fainter fluxes with the model of Lagache et al. (2004). In\nour sample, the lowest (1-\u03c3) noise levels observed toward stars located in clean portions of\nthe sky are \u223c2 mJy, somewhat worse than Dole et al.'s best-case limit. This difference is\nattributable to the larger effective beam size used for our photometry/noise calculations.\nOn top of the confusion limit, a few sources have higher noise values due to galactic cirrus\nand/or modestly worse than typical detector performance. In particular, HD168443, located\nwithin 2.5 degrees of the galactic plane, shows extremely high levels of cirrus noise (30\nmJy/aperture, approximately equal to the level predicted from the IRAS Sky Survey Atlas)\nand is not considered further.\nWhile we can directly examine the overall background noise in each of our 70 \u03bcm images,\nthe systematic error terms are more difficult to evaluate. These errors must certainly be as\nlarge as those in the 24 \u03bcm data since the photospheric fitting errors should be the same for\nboth wavelengths. Within our data, we find that the observed dispersion of fluxes at 70 \u03bcm\nis consistent with larger systematic errors than at 24 \u03bcm. We assume that the systematic\nerrors in the 70 \u03bcm data are 15% of the stellar flux, about twice the dispersion in the 24 \u03bcm\ndata. Given the complex calibration required for the 70 \u03bcm Germanium photoconductors,\nthis is an excellent level of performance.\nAdding all of the noise sources (photon noise, sky background, model fitting, and residual\ncalibration issues) together in quadrature gives us a final noise estimate for each 70 \u03bcm target.\nIn Table 2 we list these noise levels, along with the measured and the photospheric fluxes, for\neach of the planet-bearing stars. We use these noise estimates to calculate \u03c770 , the statistical\nsignificance of any IR excess\nF70 \u2212 F\u22c6\n\u03c770 \u2261\n(1)\nN70\nwhere F70 is the measured flux, F\u22c6 is the expected stellar flux, and N70 is the noise level, all\nat 70 \u03bcm. The resultant histogram is shown in Fig. 4. Based on this criterion, we find that 6\nout of 25 planet-bearing stars have a 3-\u03c3 or greater excess at 70 \u03bcm: HD33636 (BD+04858),\nHD50554 (BD+241451), HD52265 (HR2622), HD82943, HD117176 (70 Vir), and HD128311\n(GJ3860). Of the remaining stars, 3-\u03c3 upper limits on any excess flux range from 0.1 to 1.9\ntimes the stellar flux, with a median of upper limit of 0.7 F\u22c6 . The focus of this paper is the\nplanet-bearing stars; the non-planet stars with excess will be discussed in a separate paper\non the Volume Limited Sample (Bryden et al. 2005).\nFig. 5 shows the 70 \u03bcm images for each of the six planet-bearing stars identified as having\nsignificant 70 \u03bcm excess. The full-width half-maximum for the telescope's point spread\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\nfunction at 70 \u03bcm is 17\u2032\u2032 ; there is no evidence for any emission extended beyond the point\nspread function. The background noise fluctuations are generally smooth across the field,\nwith the exception of HD52265 which has obvious cirrus contamination concentrated toward\nthe NW corner of the image. Within the entire \u223c5\u00d72.5 arcmin MIPS field of view, most\nof the images contain point sources other than the target star. Some of these neighboring\nsources have corresponding 24 \u03bcm emission, while others are only detected at 70 \u03bcm.\n\n2.3.\n\nNotes on individual sources\n\nHD82943: This is our strongest detection of an excess, with a 70 \u03bcm flux 15 times the\nstellar photosphere. The lack of excess at 24 \u03bcm requires the spectral energy distribution to\nrise steeply above the photosphere between 24 and 70 \u03bcm. As the brightest excess detection\n(113 mJy), this is the most promising candidate for follow-up detection at longer IR and submm wavelengths. We also note that the claimed detection of 6 Li in this star's atmosphere\ncould be explained by the accretion of several M\u2295 of rock (Israelian et al. 2001, 2003). While\nour observed IR excess implies that collisions could have recently showered the star with\nsome solid material, it is not clear whether the magnitude of this accretion is large enough\nto account for the enhanced lithium abundance.\nHD33636 & HD50554: These similar stars both have considerable excess at 70 \u03bcm (\u223c7\ntimes the stellar flux), but still only emit 33 and 40 mJy respectively. Although dim, these\n< 40\nsystems may still be detectable at sub-mm wavelength if the dust is cold enough (\u223c\nK), and even upper limits at longer wavelengths would greatly help to constrain the dust\ntemperature, and hence location.\nHD128311: This star shows a definite detection above the photospheric level at 70 \u03bcm,\nbut a high degree of galactic cirrus and/or anomalous instrument artifacts make follow-up\nobservations important for determining the strength of the excess more accurately. The\nSpitzer/IRS spectrum for this source lies well below the low quality (FQUAL=2) detection\nat 25 \u03bcm by IRAS and shows no evidence for an excess out to 30 \u03bcm. Additional photometric\nmeasurements with MIPS are currently scheduled.\nHD117176 (70 Vir): Unlike all of our other stars with 70 \u03bcm excess, the accuracy of the\nflux measurements for this star are limited by systematic/fitting errors, rather than by sky\nnoise. Additional work to determine the source of the systematic errors will help quantify\nthe overall noise level for this star.\nHD52265: Although this star has a high level of excess at 70 \u03bcm (a factor of 4 above\nthe stellar photosphere), this is our least statistically significant detection of excess due to\n\n\f\u2013 10 \u2013\na high level of galactic cirrus in the field. This noise (7.4 mJy) unfortunately may not be\ngreatly reduced with additional integration time. Interestingly, this star happens to fall in\nthe limited field of view of the future space-based telescope COROT (Baglin et al. 2002). As\nthe only planet-bearing primary target for that mission, its visible emission will be monitored\nover an extended time period for any variability due to transiting objects.\nHD142: This star has a flux twice that of the stellar photosphere, but the potential\nexcess is only significant at the 2.4-\u03c3 level. A relatively short integration time was used (3\ncycles) resulting in above average background noise. Additional follow-up observations of\nthis star should clarify whether the excess is due to dust or is just a noise fluctuation.\n55 (\u03c1) Cnc: With a measured flux of 18.9 \u00b1 3.8 mJy (compared to a predicted stellar flux of 18.2 mJy), we find no evidence for an IR excess. This is in contrast with a\nclaimed detection of 60 \u03bcm excess by ISO (Dominik et al. 1998) at the level of 170 \u00b1 30\nmJy. The original detection has more recently been attributed to background extragalactic\nsources based on sub-mm mapping of the region (Jayawardhana et al. 2002). We confirm\nthe presence of two (presumably) extragalactic 70 \u03bcm sources located at 08:52:37+28:20:05\nand 08:52:35+28:19:18, which correspond to sub-mm sources 1 and 3 from Jayawardhana\net al. (2002). However, the 70 \u03bcm flux from these neighboring sources is small; a beam large\nenough to enclose them makes little appreciable change in the total integrated flux.\n\u03c1 CrB & HD210277: Along with 55 Cnc, these stars were identified as having extended\nemission via coronographic measurements at visible wavelengths (Trilling et al. 2000). We\nfind no evidence for excess emission around either star at 24 or 70 \u03bcm.\n\n3.\n\nCorrelation of Excess with System Parameters\n\nHere we examine whether IR excess is correlated with stellar properties (age, metallicity,\nspectral type) and planet orbital characteristics (planet mass, semi-major axis, eccentricity).\nThe planet and star properties are summarized in Tables 1 and 3.\nThe planetary systems considered here all have at least one planet with mass greater\nthan Jupiter's and with semi-major axis smaller than Jupiter's. Considering this sample\nin aggregate, there is a clear trend between the presence of this type of planet and the\ndetection of IR excess. Within our sample we have found 6 stars with excesses out of the\n25 planet-bearing stars for a detection rate of 24 \u00b1 10%. This is much less than the excess\ndetection rates for young stars; Habing et al. (2001) observe that 60% of A-K stars younger\nthan 400 Myr have excess 60 \u03bcm emission, while Rieke et al. (2004) similarly find that half of\nyoung A stars have excess 24 \u03bcm emission. Analysis of IRAS and ISO data suggests that the\n\n\f\u2013 11 \u2013\nfraction of stars with excesses drops considerably with increasing age, however, particularly\nbeyond 1 Gyr (Habing et al. 2001; Decin et al. 2003). The nominal IRAS statistics suggest\nthat excesses are found around just 10-15% of all main-sequence stars (Backman & Paresce\n1993), a factor of two less than our detection rate. If ages older than 1 Gyr are considered,\nthe disparity in rates becomes more significant. ISO surveys found excesses around only\n10\u00b13% of stars older than 400 Myr (Decin et al. 2000; Habing et al. 2001). This detection\nrate is similar to that found within our sample of stars not known to have planets (Bryden et\nal. 2005). Within this group, 10 \u00b1 4% (6 out of 58) of the stars exhibit excess IR emission at\n70 \u03bcm. Among stars older than 1 Gyr, the detection rate for stars with planets is more than\ndouble that for stars without. This tentative result would be consistent with the suggestion\nof Dominik & Decin (2003) that excesses due to Kuiper Belt material can have very long\nlifetimes. The apparent increase in frequency of dust disks around planet-bearing stars over\nstars without known planets implies that searches for dust disks might benefit from targeted\nsearches of planet-bearing stars. The converse would also be true - planet searches, vis radial\nvelocity or otherwise, may benefit from specifically targeting stars with IR excesses. This\ncorrelation is preliminary and will be examined closely as additional stars in this survey are\nobserved.\n\n3.1.\n\nPlanet Orbital Characteristics\n\nWhat kind of planets do stars with debris disks possess? Table 1 and Fig. 6 summarize\nthe properties of the planetary systems. Two of the systems with strong excesses have large\nplanets on distant, eccentric orbits (9.3 MJup at 3.6 AU for HD33636 and 4.9 MJup at 2.4 AU\nfor HD50554). The system with strongest excess, HD82943, has two moderate-sized planets\nwith masses \u223c1 MJup at 0.73 and 1.16 AU. Overall, however, the distribution of planets\nassociated with IR excess is little different than for those without an excess. For every type\nof planet with IR excess, there are counter-examples without excess: for example, HD39091\nhas a large planet on a distant, eccentric orbit yet shows no dust emission. The only possible\ntrend is that no systems with short-period planets (<0.25 AU) exhibit any IR excess, though\nthe small-number statistics limit the strength of this conclusion.\nPlanets should affect the diffuse material in their immediate vicinity. The region under\nthe\nq direct gravitational influence of a planet at ap with eccentricity ep has a half-width of\n2\n4e2p a2p /3 + 12rH\n, where rH \u2261 ap (Mp /3M\u22c6 )1/3 is the Hill radius (e.g. Bryden et al. 2000).\nFor the planet orbiting HD33636 (Mp sini=9.28MJup , ap =3.56 AU, ep =0.53) this directly\nperturbed region extends from 1 to 6 AU where we have ignored the unknown inclination\neffect which enters only weakly into the Hill radius. This zone would be cleared of any large\n\n\f\u2013 12 \u2013\nobjects that might provide a local source of dust generation. Although dust could drift\ntoward the planet from a distant belt of source bodies, Jupiter-mass planets are efficient\nat gravitationally scattering this dust from their neighborhood (Moro-Martin & Malhotra\n2005). Outside of the planet's region of direct influence, substantial Kuiper Belt material\n> 10 AU and effective temperatures below 100 K, consistent\ncould be present at distances \u223c\nwith the cool excess (no 24 \u03bcm emission) seen toward these stars. Additional Spitzer and\nground-based submillimeter data are required to constrain the temperature and the physical\ndistribution of this material (Sheret et al. 2004).\n\n3.2.\n\nStellar Properties\n\nStellar ages cited in the literature for these stars span at least a factor of two, highlighting\nthe difficulty in determining ages for mature, main sequence stars. Whenever possible, we\nadopt ages from the compilation of Wright et al. (2004) which provides a uniform tabulation\nfor 1200 stars based on Ca II H&K line strengths. While Table 3 lists the ages for the\nplanet-bearing stars, Fig. 7 gives a histogram for the larger sample, both with and without\nplanets.\nThere is no obvious age difference between the overall planet-bearing and non-planet\nbearing samples; their median ages are 6 and 4 Gyr respectively. The one outlier among\nthe planet-bearing sample is HD128311, which has no well-determined age. It is listed as a\npossible member of the UMa moving group (King et al. 2003) based on its chromospheric\nactivity and its X-ray detection in the ROSAT All Sky Survey. Both of these indicators\nsuggest an age of 0.5-1 Gyr. In Fig. 7, the stars with excess are flagged with arrows, solid\nfor planet-bearing stars and open for those without. With the exception of HD128311, the\nplanet-bearing stars with excesses are all much older than a billion years. The planet-bearing\nexcess stars are slightly younger than the planet-bearing sample as a whole (4.4 vs. 6.0 Gyr),\nbut the difference is not statistically significant. Any inverse correlation of age with amount\nof dust is much weaker than that observed in stars younger than 1 Gyr (e.g. Decin et al.\n2003; Rieke et al. 2004).\nFig. 8 presents a similar histogram for the metallicity of stars with/without planets,\nagain marking IR excess stars with arrows. The distribution of metallicities for planetbearing stars (dark grey) is clearly different than for those without planets (light grey).\nThe typical metallicity of stars with planets is well known to be greater than solar (Wright\net al. 2004; Fischer & Valenti 2003) so the fact that the average metallicity of these stars\nis slightly greater than solar, [Fe/H]= 0.13 \u00b1 0.05 with a dispersion of 0.19, is no surprise.\nAlthough the planet-bearing stars with excess have an average metallicity above solar, their\n\n\f\u2013 13 \u2013\naverage [Fe/H]=0.05 is below the planet-bearing average. Comparing the stars with and\nwithout planets to their own samples, there is no evidence for higher metallicity resulting in\na greater amount of IR emitting dust.\n\n4.\n\nAnalysis of Detected Dust\n\nUnfortunately, our detections of IR excess provide only limited information about the\nproperties of the dust in each system. Ideally, we would like to determine the dust's temperature, mass, grain sizes, and overall distribution. Because none of our sources are resolved\n(see Fig. 5), we have no information on whether the dust disk has any asymmetric structure\nsuch as a warp, a centering offset, or general clumpiness. Still, we can use the spectral energy distribution (SED) to provide some constraints on the dust properties. The most direct\nconstraint provided by the SED is on the dust temperature, which then can be converted\ninto a radial distance from the central star. As seen in Fig. 3, 24 \u03bcm measurements provide\nan upper limit on the dust temperature, while sub-mm limits set a lower limit. Because we\nusually have no information longward of 70 \u03bcm, however, only an upper limit on the temperature (or an inner limit on the dust's orbital location) can be derived. If a dust temperature\nis assumed, the observed flux can be translated into the total dust disk luminosity relative\nto its parent star.\nFor disks with detections of IR excess, a minimum dust luminosity can be calculated.\nUsing the blackbody formula for flux (F \u221d L/T 4 (eh\u03bd/kT \u2212 1)), for long wavelength radiation\n(i.e. on the Rayleigh-Jeans tail of the stellar blackbody curve), the ratio of dust to stellar\nfluxes becomes\nFdust\nLdust\nh\u03bdT\u22c63\n(2)\n=\n4\n(eh\u03bd/kTdust \u2212 1)\nF\u22c6\nL\u22c6 kTdust\nThe minimum disk luminosity as a function of 70 \u03bcm dust flux can be obtained unambiguously by setting the emission peak at 70 \u03bcm (or, equivalently, Tdust = 52.5K) :\nLdust\n(minimum) = 10\u22125\nL\u22c6\n\n\u0012\n\n5600 K\nT\u22c6\n\n\u00133\n\nF70,dust\nF70,\u22c6\n\n(3)\n\nConsistent with this formula, Fig. 9 shows constraints on Ldust /L\u22c6 and Tdust for HD82943,\nthe planet-bearing star with 70 \u03bcm flux a factor of 15 above the stellar photosphere. The\nlines in this figure are based on the 3-\u03c3 limits to the observed 24 and 70 \u03bcm fluxes. Tdust\nis meant to signify the typical emitting temperature for the dust; in reality some range of\ntemperatures will be found in any given system. For this star, our strongest detected excess,\nthe minimum Ldust /L\u22c6 is relatively high - 1.4 \u00d7 10\u22124 - more than two orders of magnitude\n\n\f\u2013 14 \u2013\nabove estimates for the Kuiper belt's luminosity. (A listing of minimum Ldust /L\u22c6 for the\nother planet-bearing stars is given in Table 2.) The dust temperature is well-constrained by\n< 70 K at the 3-\u03c3 level (the cross-hatched region in Fig. 9) or\nthe lack of 24 \u03bcm excess to be \u223c\n<\n\u223c 60 K at the 1-\u03c3 level (the solid-filled region). Dust at lower temperatures showing greater\nemission at longer wavelengths cannot be ruled out.\nSub-mm observations are critical to constraining the dust properties and thus the overall\nmass of the material responsible the the excess in these stars. Fig. 10 shows the limits on\nthe dust characteristics for a case where sub-mm data is available to help constrain the dust\ntemperature on the low end. (Greaves et al. (2004) observed HD117176 at 850 \u03bcm, measuring\na flux of 2.3 \u00b1 2.4 mJy.) Note that in order to set the most strict limits, we assume that the\ngrains are small enough that their emissivity drops off as \u03bb\u22122 for long-wavelength radiation\n(see e.g. Draine & Lee 1984; Wyatt & Dent 2002). The sub-mm measurement does set a\nlower limit for the dust temperature, but because the 70 \u03bcm emission is not as strong as for\nthe previous star, the upper limit on temperature is less strict. Overall, the possible range\nof dust temperature and luminosity are much better constrained: 1-\u03c3 limits (the solid-filled\nregion in Fig. 10) give Tdust \u2248 20 to 100 K, Ldust /L\u22c6 \u2248 10\u22125.2 to 10\u22124.2 . For a temperature\nof 50 K, this disk brightness corresponds to a total dust surface area of \u223c1025 -1026 cm2 or,\nequivalently, a dust mass of \u223c10\u22126 -10\u22125 M\u2295 in 100 \u03bcm grains. The mass contained in larger\nplanetesimals is even less certain.\nFor stars with no detected emission, a 3-\u03c3 upper limit on the fluxes leads to upper limits\nfor Ldust /L\u22c6 of 10\u22126 to 10\u22125 , assuming a dust temperature of \u223c50 K (again see Table 2).\nFor these stars we are setting limits of \u223c10-100 times the level of dust in our solar system.\nDeeper integrations on these stars may result in detections of fainter excesses or improved\nupper limits, but extragalactic confusion or cirrus will set limits on the amount of detectable\nexcess for these relatively distant stars. Non-planet bearing stars in the VLS are brighter\nand typically located in more cirrus-free regions, so that our Ldust /L\u22c6 limits for these objects\ntend to be more sensitive than for the planet-bearing stars reported here.\n\n5.\n\nConclusions\n\nSpitzer/MIPS observations of 26 main-sequence FGK stars which are known to have\nplanetary companions reveal 70 \u03bcm dust emission from 6 debris disks. These are the first\nexamples outside the solar system of stars which have both well-confirmed planets and wellconfirmed IR excesses. We conclude from this study that excesses at 70 \u03bcm are at least as\ncommon around planet-bearing F5-K5 stars as they are around the A-F stars first detected\nby IRAS.\n\n\f\u2013 15 \u2013\nOur finding is in contrast with Greaves et al. (2004), who found no overlap between stars\nwith disks and stars with planets. In order to look for dust/planet systems, they observed a\nsample of 8 planet-bearing stars in the sub-mm, with no detections. The disks identified by\nSpitzer, however, are considerably less massive than those detectable in the submillimeter.\nFor example, in the case of \u01eb Eri, the ratio of 60 \u03bcm IRAS emission (1,600 mJy) to 850 \u03bcm\nemission (40 mJy) is 40:1. If this same ratio applies to the sources seen here which have\na typical 70 \u03bcm brightness of 35 mJy, the predicted submillimeter flux density would be\n\u223c1 mJy which is just the 1-\u03c3 noise limit for the SCUBA survey. Six of the eight sub-mm\nsources are also in our target sample, allowing a direct comparison of Spitzer with SCUBA.\n> 5,\nIn contrast with the sub-mm non-detections, five photospheres were observed with SNR\u223c\nand one star (HD117176, 70 Vir) was found to have significant 70 \u03bcm excess. While SCUBA\nfollow-up observations of the sources detected here will be very important for constraining\nthe temperature and total mass of dust, conclusions about the incidence of disks around\nplanet-bearing stars require Spitzer's higher sensitivity.\nWhile excesses at 70 \u03bcm are relatively frequent in our survey, we find no evidence for\nexcess at 24 \u03bcm around any of the planet-bearing stars. The lack of 24 \u03bcm emission in\nthese systems is consistent with the previously known lack of warm material toward stars\nolder than a few 100 Myr (Aumann & Probst 1991; Fajardo-Acosta et al. 2000; Laureijs\net al. 2002). Assuming peak 24 \u03bcm emission from 150 K dust and the observed dispersion\n(Fd /F\u22c6 < 0.07), we can set a 3-\u03c3 upper limit on Ldust /L\u22c6 for hotter dust of 5 \u00d7 10\u22125 which\nis well above the 10\u22127 level of emission from our asteroid belt, but well below the level seen\ntoward young A stars such as \u03b2 Pic or Fomalhaut (\u03b1 PsA). As described above, the lack of\nwarm material is consistent with its destruction or dispersal by the gravitational effect of\nplanets in the 1-5 AU region (Liou & Zook 1999).\nFor stars with a single measurement of excess at 70 \u03bcm, the dust properties are not\nwell constrained, but are generally consistent with Kuiper belt configurations - distances of\nseveral tens of AU and temperatures \u223c50 K. The observed dust luminosities (relative to the\ncentral stars'), however, are much brighter, exceeding the Kuiper belt's Ldust /L\u22c6 by factors\nof \u223c100.\nWithin the planet-bearing sample there is little to no correlation of 70 \u03bcm excess with\nstellar age, metallicity, or spectral type. But there is a strong hint of a positive correlation\nbetween both the frequency and the magnitude of dust emission with the presence of known\nplanets. As more Spitzer observations of planet-bearing and non-planet-bearing stars are\nmade, as part of this survey and in other programs, these statistics will become much better\ndefined. Additional radial velocity studies of stars with excesses but without presently known\nplanets will test the predictive power of this correlation.\n\n\f\u2013 16 \u2013\nWe would like to thank Debra Fischer and Geoff Marcy for discussions on stellar metallicity, updates on RV planet searches, and commentary on \u01eb Eri's variability.

A gaussian distribution with dispersion 0.07 is shown for comparison.\nOne star (HD69830; Beichman et al. 2005) clearly stands out from the main population of\nstars with no excess emission above their stellar photospheres. In this histogram and those\nthat follow, stars with planets are shaded with dark grey while stars without known planets\nare designated by light grey.\n\n\f\u2013 24 \u2013\n\nFig. 2.- Distribution of 70 \u03bcm fluxes relative to the expected photospheric values for a\nsample of 84 stars. While most stars cluster around 1, where their flux is photospheric,\nseveral stars show a high degree of excess emission. Stars with planets are shaded as dark\ngrey while stars without known planets are designated with light grey. Although planetbearing stars make up less than a third of the sample, four out of the five stars with the\nhighest factor of excess 70 \u03bcm emission are known to have planets.\n\n\f\u2013 25 \u2013\n\nFig. 3.- Spectral energy distributions for HD82943 and HD117176. In addition to our 24\nand 70 \u03bcm Spitzer data (dark circles), we also show optical measurements and IRAS fluxes\nat 12 and 25 \u03bcm. For HD117176, a sub-mm (850 \u03bcm) constraint is also available (Greaves\net al. 2004). The emission from dust at a given temperature (dashed lines) is added to the\nstellar Kurucz model (dotted line) in order to fit the observed excess emission at 70 \u03bcm. In\neach plot, two separate fits (two different dust temperatures) are considered. In the case of\nHD82943 hot dust (150 K) is ruled out by the 24 \u03bcm observations, while for HD117176 cold\ndust (20 K) is excluded by the sub-mm upper limit (see \u00a74 for discussion of the limits on\ndust temperature and luminosity).\n\n\f\u2013 26 \u2013\n\nFig. 4.- Statistical significance of deviations from the expected stellar flux at 70 \u03bcm. A\ngaussian distribution of errors is shown for comparison. In order to be considered a significant\n70 \u03bcm excess, \u03c770 should at least exceed the 3-\u03c3 level. Six of the stars with planets (dark\ngrey) meet this criterion, as do six of the stars without known planets (light grey).\n\nFig. 5.- 70 \u03bcm images for the six planet-bearing stars with excess emission. The contrast\nscale is the same for each image. The images are \u223c2 arcmin on each side; the beam size\nfwhm is 17\u2032\u2032 . North is oriented upward and east to the left within each frame.\n\n\f\u2013 27 \u2013\n\nFig. 6.- Orbital characteristics for the survey stars. Minimum planet mass (Mp sini) is\nplotted versus each planet's semi-major axis (ap ). The lines extend from periapse (ap (1\u2212ep ))\nto apoapse (ap (1 + ep )). The planets which are associated with 70 \u03bcm excess are marked as\ntriangles, while those without are circles.\n\n\f\u2013 28 \u2013\n\nFig. 7.- Distribution of stellar ages. Stars with planets are shaded as dark grey while stars\nwithout known planets are designated with light grey. The ages of stars with 70 \u03bcm excess\nare flagged as arrows at the top of the plot. For planet-bearing stars the arrows are filled;\nfor stars without known planets they are open. The length of the arrow is an indicator of\nthe strength of 70 \u03bcm excess.\n\n\f\u2013 29 \u2013\n\nFig. 8.- Distribution of stellar metallicities. Stars with planets are shaded as dark grey\nwhile stars without known planets are designated with light grey. The metallicities of stars\nwith 70 \u03bcm excess are flagged as arrows at the top of the plot. For planet-bearing stars the\narrows are filled; for stars without known planets they are open. The length of the arrow is\nan indicator of the strength of 70 \u03bcm excess.\n\n\f\u2013 30 \u2013\n\nFig. 9.- Constraints on the temperature and total luminosity of the dust around HD82943,\nas provided by 24 and 70 \u03bcm MIPS observations. The area to the upper right (hot temperature, bright luminosity) is ruled out by the 24 \u03bcm upper limit on the dust emission. The\n3-\u03c3 limits around 70 \u03bcm detection confine the dust characteristics within the cross-hatched\nregion. The solid-filled region is defined by 1-\u03c3 error limits. Without any longer wavelength\ninformation, there is no lower limit on the dust temperature or upper limit on the dust\nluminosity. The approximate characteristics of the asteroid and Kuiper belts are shown for\ncomparison.\n\n\f\u2013 31 \u2013\n\nFig. 10.- Constraints on the temperature and total luminosity of the dust around\nHD117176, as provided by 24 and 70 \u03bcm MIPS data combined with sub-mm observations.\nThe upper right is ruled out by the 24 \u03bcm upper limit, while the upper left is ruled out by the\nsub-mm (Greaves et al. 2004). Based on the 70 \u03bcm data, the dust temperature and luminosity are confined to the shaded region. The 3-\u03c3 limits for the three wavelengths confine the\ndust characteristics within the cross-hatched region, while the solid-filled region is defined\nby 1-\u03c3 error limits. Again, the approximate characteristics of the asteroid and Kuiper belts\nare shown for comparison. Note that although the formal 3-\u03c3 error limits extend as low as\nthe Kuiper belt's luminosity, the Kuiper belt itself would be too faint to detect.\n\n\f"}
