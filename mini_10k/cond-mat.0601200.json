In particular, we look at the effect of the atomic relaxation on the energy barrier for\nmagnetic domain wall migration and, reversely, at the effect of the magnetic state on the mechanical forces and structural relaxation. We observe changes of the barrier height due to the atomic\nrelaxation up to 200%, suggesting a very strong coupling between the structural and the magnetic\ndegrees of freedom. The reverse interplay is weak, i.e. the magnetic state has little effect on the\nstructural relaxation at equilibrium or under non-equilibrium, current-carrying conditions.\nPACS numbers: 75.75.+a, 73.63.Rt, 75.60.Jk, 72.70.+m\n\nExisting experimental techniques are capable of constructing low-dimensional magnetic constrictions consisting of a tiny number of atoms and measuring their transport properties [1, 2, 3]. In this rapidly evolving field\nexperiments and theoretical simulations are closely entangled and the latter can provide important information on the fundamental dynamics at the atomic scale.\nThe modeling of atomic-sized ferromagnetic devices under bias requires the combined description of electron\ntransport and of the local magnetization and structural\ndynamics at the atomic level [4]. In fact, since the spinpolarized current transfers both spin and charge, it exerts\na twofold effect on the current-carrying structure, interlinking its structural and magnetic degrees of freedom.\nIn order to investigate the mutual interplay between\nmagnetic and structural properties, we have developed\na computational scheme for evaluating spin-polarized\ncurrents and the associated current-induced forces and\ntorques. On one hand, we are able to examine the energetics of magnetization dynamical processes as a function\nof the atomic rearrangements in magnetic point contacts\nunder bias. On the other hand, we can ravel out the\neffect of the magnetic configuration itself on the structural relaxation. Our main finding is that this interplay\nis strong only in one direction. While the atomic rearrangements can modify drastically the point contact\nmagneto-dynamics, the magnetic configuration has little\neffect on the atomic configuration.\nOur computational approach combines the nonequilibrium Green's function (NEGF) method for evaluating the charge density and the current [5, 6] with a\ndescription of the magnetization dynamics in terms of\nquasistatic thermally-activated transitions between stationary configurations [7]. This scheme is general and\nis conceptually transferable [7] to first-principles Hamiltonians, for instance [6], within density functional theory. However, it is currently implemented in an empirical\nsingle-orbital tight-binding (TB) model [8] with parameters chosen to simulate the mechanical properties of no-\n\nble metals and the basic electronic structure of a generic\nmagnetic metal. This has the benefit of being reasonably\nrealistic while keeping the computational overheads to a\nminimum.\nThe magnetic and structural degrees of freedom both\nenter our model as classical variables. We associate a\nclassical magnetic dipole moment (MM) and a set of\nCartesian coordinates to each atom in the system. The\nmagnetic state (MS) is defined by a set of angular coordinates \u03a6 \u2261 {\u03c6i }. These represent the angles of the MMs\nof the \"live\" atoms (those contributing to the dynamics)\nwith respect to a given direction. The structural state\nRi }\n(SS) is defined by a set of spatial coordinates R \u2261 {R\nfor these atoms. The interplay between MS and SS is\nthen investigated by either fixing \u03a6 and evolving R or\nby fixing R and evolving \u03a6. In the first case we study\nhow the MS affects the structural relaxation, and in the\nsecond how the SS modifies the magnetic dynamics.\nOur mixed quantum-classical Hamiltonian for this system reads\nX\nTB\n[Hij\n(R) + Vij\u03c3 (\u03a6)] c\u2020i\u03c3 cj\u03c3 +\nH(\u03a6, R) =\ni,j,\u03c3\n\n+ \u03a9(R) + W (\u03a6)\n\n(1)\n\nwhere c\u2020i\u03c3 and ci\u03c3 are creation and annihilation operators\nfor electrons with spin \u03c3 at atomic site i. H(\u03a6, R) is\nseparated into several quantum and classical terms. The\nfirst term reads\n\u0012\n\u0013q\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u01ebc af\nTB\nTB\nHij (R) = E0 + Vi (R) \u03b4ij \u2212\n(2)\n2 Rij\nj6=i\nwhere E0 is the on-site energy for an isolated atom, ViT B\nrepresents an empirical approximation to the secondorder Coulomb energy at the i-th site\nViT B (R) =\n\nX\nk\n\nfik (R)\u2206qk =\n\nX\nk\n\n\u03ba \u2206q\np el k\n2\nRik + \u03ba2el /U 2\n\n(3)\n\n\f2\nwhere we have\nfik (R), \u03bael = e2 /4\u03c0\u03b50 = 14.4\nP defined\n\u03c3\neV\u00c5, \u2206qj = \u03c3 \u03c1jj \u2212 (\u03c10 )jj is the deviation of the electron occupancy of site j (\u03c1\u03c3jj being a diagonal term of\nthe density matrix for spin \u03c3) from its equilibrium noninteracting value \u03c10 . The last term in Eq. (2) is the\nintersite hopping integral, depending as an inverse power\nRi \u2212 R j |. Here\nq = 4 on the interatomic distance Rij = |R\nwe use \u01eb = 7.8680 meV, c = 139.07, af = 4.08 \u00c5, which\nare parameters fitted to elastic properties of bulk gold\n[8]. The value of the on-site Coulomb repulsion is U = 7\neV and the band filling is \u03c10 = 0.7 electrons per atom.\nThis non-integer band filling effectively accounts for the\ns-p-d hybridization.\nThe structure of our atomic point-contact system is\npresented in Figure 1. It consists of a linear chain of\nthree atoms attached to two semi-infinite leads with a\nsimple cubic structure and 3 \u00d7 3 atom cross-section. The\nlead magnetizations are polarized along the z-axis and\nthey are anti-parallel (AP) to each other. The MMs\nof the atoms in the chain are allowed to rotate in the\n(x \u2212 z)-plane, and are described by the set of polar coordinates \u03a6 = {\u03c6i } (i = 1, 2, 3) about the z-axis. In\nthis setup an abrupt domain wall (DW) is formed in the\nconstriction. Note that our model does not include spatial spin anisotropy, therefore the direction of the spinquantization axis z is arbitrary. In this sense a Ne\u00e9l and\na Bloch wall are physically identical within our model.\nz\n\na\n\n\u03c61\n\na\n\n\u03c62\n\n\u03c63\n\n00 00\n11\n11\n00\n11\n00\n11\n000 11\n11\n00\n11\n11 00\n0\n112\n00\n\ny\n\nx\n\na\n\n11\n00\n00\n11\n0\n1\n11\n00\n00\n11\n00\n11\n0\n1\n1\n0\n00\n11\n3\n4\n\n\u03bc1\n\ni,j6=i\n\n(5)\n\ni,j6=i\n\nand a Heisenberg-type nearest-neighbors spin-spin interaction between the localized spins\nW (\u03a6) = \u2212\n\nJdd X\nJdd X\nSi * Sj = \u2212\ncos (\u03c6i \u2212 \u03c6j ) ,\n2\n2\ni,j6=i\n\ni,j6=i\n\n(6)\nwhere Jdd > 0 is a parameter describing the strength of\nthe intersite exchange interaction.

Clearly, the low coordination alters the values for the exchange parameters [2], though\nthis effect was not explicitly included here. However, we\nhave repeated the calculation for J from 0.8 eV upto 2 eV\nas well as for other force parameterizations (for Cu [8])\nand found no qualitative differences in the main physical\nresults.\nForces and torques, associated with the classical\ndegrees of freedom, are derived from the HellmannFeynman theorem, generalized for non-equilibrium systems.

See text\nfor details. Here J = 1 eV, Jdd = 50 meV.\n\nThe \"live\" atoms in the constriction are relaxed at a\ngiven finite bias for a fixed MS. For symmetry reasons the\natomic relaxation always results in displacements only\nalong the longitudinal direction (y-axis). Thus, we denote the relaxed atomic positions at a bias voltage of V\nand a magnetic state \u03c6 during relaxation by yV (\u03c6). The\ninitial geometry, denoted by yuni , is that of equidistant\natoms with a nearest-neighbor distance of a = 2.5 \u00c5(see\nFig. 1). This is near the equilibrium bond length of a\nperiodic 1D chain within our model [12]. However, such\na bond length produces a compressive stress in the bulk\nleads, as a result of which the leftmost and rightmost\natoms are pushed slightly out of the leads and the whole\nchain at equilibrium shrinks by about 2% [see Fig. 2(a)].\nFirst we investigate how the MS of the constriction affects its structural relaxation. We relax the live atoms\nin {\u03c6(1) } = (0, 0, \u03c0) or {\u03c6(2) } = (0, \u03c0, \u03c0) configuration,\nwhich represent two possible spatial positions of the DW\ninside the constriction, as well as for intermediate MSs\nwith \u03c62 \u2208 [0, \u03c0] and \u03c61,3 such that T1,3 = 0. The DW-\n\nmotion induced displacements \u2206y\u03c6 = yV (\u03c62 ) \u2212 yV (00\u03c0)\nare monotonic functions of \u03c62 [see Fig. 2(b), where\nV = 1V ]. They represent nearly rigid translations of\nthe whole atomic chain in the direction of the electron\nflow. However, these displacements are very small and\nconstitute about 3% of the displacements from the uniform structure \u2206yuni = y0 ({\u03c6(1,2) }) \u2212 yuni [Fig. 2(a)].\nThe former depend weakly on the bias [Fig. 2(d)].\nThe effect of the bias voltage on the atomic relaxation\n\u2206yV = yV (\u03c6) \u2212 y0 (\u03c6) for \u03c6 = {\u03c6(1,2) } is demonstrated in\nFigure 2(c). The relative current-induced displacements\nare smooth functions of V and promote a tendency towards dimerization. |\u2206yV | /a < 0.7% (upto V = 2 V)\nare of the same order of in magnitude to the displacements \u2206y\u03c6 . Interestingly, the former are almost insensitive to the MS {\u03c6(1,2) }, which is a result of the weak\nbias-dependence of \u2206y{\u03c6(2) } [see Fig. 2(d)]. Other MS,\nhaving multiple abrupt DWs [e.g. (\u03c0, 0, \u03c0)], are found to\nproduce an effect of similar magnitude on the atomic relaxation (not shown in this work). This establishes that\nthe structural properties of a magnetic nano-device under bias are to a large extent independent of the magnetic\nstate.\nNext we address the converse, that is whether the\nstructural relaxation affects the energy barrier for DW\nmigration. This is calculated from the torque T2 as the\nMM of atom \"2\" is quasistatically rotated. The other\ntwo live MMs are continually relaxed so that their associated torques are kept at zero [7]. The net work for this\nrotation is then\nZ \u03c62\nT2 (\u03c6\u20322 ) d\u03c6\u20322\n(9)\nW (\u03c62 ) = \u2212\n0\n\nOur calculated DW migration barriers (DWMB) for a\nfew values of J are shown in Figure 3. A key feature of\nthese profiles is the tilt of the barrier at any finite bias\neven for a uniform atomic arrangement. This tilt results\nfrom the fact that in the absence of the special symmetry in the density of states that characterize the present\nsimple cubic structure in the case of a half-filled band [7],\nthe leading contributions to current-induced forces and\ntorques are linear in the bias. This asymmetry results in\na preferential spatial localization of the DW at a given\nbias: under the present (positive) bias the (0, 0, \u03c0) configuration is stable, while the (0, \u03c0, \u03c0) is at most metastable.\nThe DW can then be driven back and forth in the constriction by an alternating current. That is an explicit\nrealization of current-driven DW motion.\nWe have then investigated the contribution of atomic\nrelaxation to the DW migration barrier. The bottom\npanels of Figure 3 show \u2206W0 = W \u2212 W0 and \u2206Wuni =\nW \u2212 Wuni as functions of \u03c62 at different bias voltages V ,\nwhere W (\u03c62 ) is the DW migration work (see Eq. (9)) for\natomic structure relaxed at the given bias and MS, while\nW0 (\u03c62 ) and Wuni (\u03c62 ) correspond to atomic structure relaxed at V = 0 and to a uniform (unrelaxed) structure\n\n\f10\n0\n1.5\n\n0\n\n-4\n\n-8\n0.5\n\n\u03c62/\u03c0\n\n-12\n1 0\n\n0.5\n\n\u03c62/\u03c0\n\n0\n-5\n-10\n-15\n-20\n1 0\n\n47.2\n\n47\n46.5\n\nV=1V\n\n60 0\n\n47\n1\n\n0.5\n\n\u03c62/\u03c0\n\n0\n\n2\n0\n-2\n-4\n\n20\n\n\u03c62/\u03c0\n\n\u03c62/\u03c0\n\nV=0\nuni\n0\n\n1\n\n46\n1\n\n0.5\n\nrelaxed\nat \u03c62\n\n40\n\n0.5\n\n47.5\n\nV=1V\n\n47.4\n\n80\n\n1\n\n0.5\n\n-4\n\n100\n\n2\n\n1\n\n-2\n\n-6\n0\n\nV=0V\nV=0.5V\nV=1V\n\nJ=2eV\n\nI (\u03bcA)\n\n20\n\nJ=1eV\n\nJ=2eV\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\nV (V)\n\nV\n\n1 (V)\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n20\n\nuni\n0\n\n0.5\n\n2\n0\n-2\n-4\n\nV=0\n\n\u2206\u0399 (\u03bc\u0391)\n\n30\n\n70\n60\n50\n40\n30\n20\n10\n0\n\nI (\u03bcA)\n\nJ=1.5eV\n\n\u2206\u0399 (\u03bc\u0391)\n\nJ=1eV\n\nI (\u03bcA)\n\n7\n6\n5\n4\n3\n2\n1\n0\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0\n\n\u2206Wuni (meV)\n\n\u2206W0\n\nW (meV)\n\n4\n\nV\n\n1\nV (V)\n\n1 (V)\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n2\n\nFIG. 3: (Color online) DW-migration energy barriers at different bias V for Jdd = 50 meV and J = 1, 1.5, 2 eV (panels\nfrom left to right).

Bottom inset: \u2206I = I \u2212 I0/uni ,\nwhere I0 (Iuni ) refer to relaxed at V = 0 (uniform) structure.\n\nrespectively. The small current-induced atomic displacements (see Fig. 2) systematically increase the DWMB\nheight (\u2206W0 > 0) by a few percent. \u2206W0 does not show\na dependence on the MS.\nHowever, the relaxation at V = 0 from the uniform arrangement, which shortens the interatomic distance between the live MMs by about 4% [Fig. 2 (a)], reduces\nthe height of DWMB approximately by \u2206Wuni /W (\u03c62 ) =\n25 \u2212 30% (see Fig. 3) for J = 1.5, 2 eV. This effect can\nincrease dramatically (to about 200%) for exchange parameters close to magnetic phase transitions. [7], [17]\nThus the magnetic properties are strongly affected by\nthe geometry of the contact, especially in the region of\nparameters where the J coupling mechanism starts competing with the direct exchange mechanism.\nFinally, the effect of the structural relaxation on the\nconductivity of the system is found to be small (Fig. 4).\nThe current is clearly insensitive to the DW migration\nwithin the constriction. The overall variation of the net\ncurrent for the rotation of \u03c62 for fixed geometry, which\nis in itself a small quantity, is further substantially compensated by structural rearrangement, i.e. the structure\nis found to respond to the magnetic rearrangement by\nstructural adjustment, which minimizes the variation in\nthe conductivity (see inset of Fig. 4). We have also\nfound a decrease in conductivity due to relaxation of the\nstructure from the uniform geometry. This agrees qualitatively with the findings in Ref. [15], although the effect\nwe observe is much smaller in magnitude.\n\nIn conclusion we have developed a method to investigate the interplay between the magnetic and structural\ndegrees of freedom of a ferromagnetic atomic point contact under bias. We have used it to assess the effects of\nthe structural relaxation on the magnetic DWMB and\nreversely the effect of the magnetic configuration on the\nstructural relaxation. Our main finding is that the interplay is only in one direction, that is the structural\nrelaxation strongly modifies the DW migration barrier.\nIn particular, we have found that the DWMB shows\na substantial asymmetry, which increases with the external bias even for a spatially symmetric system. That\nopens the possibility of voltage-controlled DW motion\nin such systems. The current-induced displacements\n(\u2206yV /a < 0.7%) from the relaxed at V = 0 structure produce a small positive shift in the DWMB height\n(\u223c 3%). This is small compared to the effect of the relaxation from the initial uniform atomic configuration at the\ngiven bias. The latter is \u2206yuni /a < 4% and has a much\nmore dramatic effect on the DWMB profile, reducing the\nbarrier height by upto 2/3 or even making the alternative MS unstable, i.e. blocking the DW migration, for\nsome exchange parameters. That is a signiture of the\nstrong non-linear dependence of spin-polarized transport\nproperties on structural rearrangements. However, structure is not affected by the DW migration under bias.\nThis is so because interatomic forces depend on the total\ncharge density of the current-carrying electrons, not on\ntheir spin polarization.\n\n\f5\nThis work has been sponsored by the Irish Higher Educational Authority under the North South Programme\nfor Collaborative Research.
