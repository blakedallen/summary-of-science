The nucleus undergoes then a phase transition from the superfluid phase to the\nnormal one (the SN phase transition). This is called the Mottelson-Valatin effect [1]. A\nsimilar effect is expected in spherical nuclei, although the rotation is no longer collective.\nThe total angular momentum is made up by those of the nucleons from the broken pairs,\nwhich occupy the single-particle levels around the Fermi surface and block them against\nthe scattered pairs. The pairing correlations decrease until a sufficiently large total angular\nmomentum Mc , where the pairing gap \u2206 completely vanishes. At finite temperature (T 6=\n0), the increase of T relaxes the tight packing of quasiparticles around the Fermi surface,\nwhich is caused by a large angular momentum M \u2265 Mc , and spreads them farther away from\nthe Fermi level. This makes some levels become partially unoccupied, therefore, available\nfor scattered pairs. As the result, when T increases up to some critical value T1 , the pairing\ncorrelations are energetically favored, and the pairing gap reappears. As T goes higher, the\nincrease of a large number of quasiparticles eventually breaks down the pairing gap at T2\n(> T1 ). This phenomenon, predicted by Kamuri [2] and Moretto [3], is called thermally\nassisted pairing or anomalous pairing, and later as pairing reentrance by Balian, Flocard\nand V\u00e9n\u00e9roni [4].\nHowever, it has been shown already in the 1960s that the sharp SN-phase transition at\nM = Mc in the Mottelson-Valatin effect is an artifact of the BCS method. As a matter of\nfact, a proper particle-number projection before variation has removed the discontinuity in\nthe pairing gap as a decreasing function of the angular momentum [5]. Similarly, by taking\nthe effect of thermal fluctuations in the pairing field into account, the SN phase transition\npredicted by the BCS theory is smoothed out. The gap \u2206(T ) of a non-rotating nucleus does\nnot collapse at Tc ' 0.568\u2206(T = 0), but monotonically decreases with increasing T , remaining finite even at T \u001d Tc [6, 7]. This result is reconfirmed by shell-model calculations of\npairing energy as a function of excitation energy [8], and by embedding the exact eigenvalues\nof the pairing problem into the canonical ensemble [9]. By considering an exactly solvable\ncranked deformed shell model Hamiltonian it has also been shown that the pairing gap,\n2\n\n\fquenched at T = 0 and high rotational frequency, reappears at T1 (\u001c Tc ) at M \u2265 Mc [10].\nHowever, different from the prediction by the BCS theory, the pairing gap does not vanish\nat T > T1 .\nThe behavior of hot rotating nuclei can be put in correspondence with superconductors in\nthe presence of an external magnetic field, where the magnetic field plays the role as that of\nthe nuclear rotation. The reentrance of superconducting correlations, which is also known\nas the unconventional superconductivity, has been the subject of recent theoretical and\nexperimental studies in condensed matter. The Grenoble High Magnetic Field Laboratory\nhas recently discovered that URhGe becomes superconducting at low temperature in the\npresence of a strong magnetic field (between 8 and 13 T), well above the field value of 2\nT, at which superconductivity is first destroyed [11]. The reentrance of superconductivity\nunder the magnetic field is interpreted as to be caused by spin reorientation [12], which bears\nsome similarity with the reappearance of the scattered pairs in rotating hot nuclei discussed\nabove.\nRecently, we have developed an approach based on the finite-temperature BCS (FTBCS)\nthat includes the effects due to quasiparticle-number fluctuations in the pairing field and\nthe z projection of angular momentum at T 6= 0, which we call as the FTBCS1 (with \"1\"\ndenoting the effect due to quasiparticle-number fluctuations) [14]. This approach reproduces\nwell the effect of smoothing out the SN phase transition at T 6= 0 as well as the pairing\nreentrance in hot (noncollectively) rotating nuclei. In the latter case, for M \u2265 Mc the\npairing gap also reappears at T1 and remains finite at T > T1 . It has also been pointed\nout that the microscopic mechanism of the nonvanishing gap at high T is the quasiparticlenumber fluctuations, which are ignored in the conventional BCS theory. A refined version\nof the FTBCS1 also includes the contribution of coupling to pair vibrations within the\nself-consistent quasiparticle random-phase approximation [14].\nThat the pairing reentrance is not an artifact of the mean field analysis, but a robust\nphysical effect, has been obtained by exact diagonalization of the 2D attractive Hubbard\nmodel, where a nonmonotonic filed dependence of the pair susceptibility in the presence of\nthe external magnetic field was found for various cluster sizes both in the weak and strong\ncoupling limit [13]. Nonetheless, the experimental extraction of the pairing gap in hot nuclei\nis not simple because one has to properly exclude the admixture with the contribution of\nuncorrelated single-particle configurations from the odd-even mass difference [15]. Therefore\n3\n\n\fthe detection of the pairing reentrance effect by using the experimentally extracted pairing\ngaps seems to be elusive, especially when the formally derived pairing gap has a value smaller\nthan the average spacing between the single-particle levels.\nMeanwhile, the heat capacity has been extracted from the experimental level densities [16]. The existence of a bump or an S shape on the curve of the heat capacity at\nT \u223c Tc allows one to discuss about the smoothing of the SN phase transition in finite nuclei.\nIn a recent calculation of the heat capacity in\n\n72\n\nGe within the Shell Model Monte Carlo\n\n(SMMC) approach, by reconfirming the pairing reentrance effect, the authors of Ref. [17]\nclaimed that they found a local dip in the heat capacity at rotation frequency of 0.5 MeV\nat T \u223c 0.45 MeV, and a corresponding local maximum on the temperature dependence of\nthe logarithm of level density. They associated such irregularities in the heat capacity and\nlevel density as the signatures of the pairing reentrance. There are, however, two concerns\nregarding these results. The first one is that, as well-known, at such low temperature the\nSMMC approach produces quite large error bars. As a consequence, instead of approaching\nzero as it should be to fulfill the third law of thermodynamics, the SMMC heat capacity at\nT < 0.5 MeV jumps to 25 \u223c 30 (Fig. 4 of [17]), which makes the statement on the signature\nof the pairing reentrance ambiguous. The second one is that the SMMC in Ref. [17] used\nthe same Fock-space single-particle energies of the shells (0f 1p \u2212 0g1d2s) for both neutron\nand proton spectra. Hence, the difference between neutron and proton spectra came solely\nfrom the difference in the valence particle numbers outside the closed-shell core of\n\n40\n\nCa,\n\nwhich ignored altogether the Coulomb barrier in the proton spectrum. Our FTBCS1 theory\nis free from such deficiency at low T , and it works well with the schematic as well as singleparticle spectra, which are obtained from the realistic Woods-Saxon potential. Therefore,\nin the present paper we will calculate the heat capacity as well as the level density within\nthe FTBCS1 theory to see if these quantities can be used to identify the pairing reentrance\nphenomenon in realistic nuclei at finite temperature and angular momentum.\nThe paper is organized as follows. The formalism for the calculations of thermodynamic\nquantities such as pairing gap, heat capacity, and level density in hot non-collectively rotating\nnuclei within the FTBCS and FTBCS1 theories is presented in Sec. II. The results of\nnumerical calculations are analyzed in Sec. III. The paper is summarized in the last section,\nwhere conclusions are drawn.\n4\n\n\fII.\n\nFORMALISM\n\nWe consider the pairing Hamiltonian describing a spherical system rotating about the\nsymmetry z axis [3]:\nH = HP \u2212 \u03bbN\u0302 \u2212 \u03b3 M\u0302 ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03bb and \u03b3 are the chemical potential and rotation frequency, respectively. HP is the\nstandard pairing Hamiltonian of a system, which consists N particles interacting via a\nmonopole pairing force with the constant parameter G (the BCS pairing Hamiltonian),\nnamely\nHP =\n\nX\n\n\u000fk (a\u2020+k a+k + a\u2020\u2212k a\u2212k ) \u2212 G\n\nwith\n\na\u2020k a\u2020\u2212k a\u2212k0 ak0 ,\n\n(2)\n\nkk0\n\nk\n\na\u2020\u00b1k (a\u00b1k )\n\nX\n\nbeing the creation (annihilation) operators of a particle (neutron or proton)\n\nwith angular momentum k, projection \u00b1mk , and energy \u000fk . The particle-number operator\nN\u0302 and total angular momentum M\u0302 , which coincides with its z projection, are given as\nN\u0302 =\n\nX\n\n(a\u2020+k a+k + a\u2020\u2212k a\u2212k ) ,\n\nM\u0302 =\n\nX\n\nmk (a\u2020+k a+k \u2212 a\u2020\u2212k a\u2212k ) .\n\n(3)\n\nk\n\nk\n\nAfter the Bogoliubov transformation from the particle operators, a\u2020k and ak , to the quasiparticle ones, \u03b1k\u2020 and \u03b1k ,\na\u2020k = uk \u03b1k\u2020 + vk \u03b1\u2212k ,\n\na\u2212k = uk \u03b1\u2212k \u2212 vk \u03b1k\u2020 ,\n\n(4)\n\nthe Hamiltonian (1) is transformed into the quasiparticle one H, whose explicit form can be\nfound, e.g., in Refs. [14, 20].\nAs has been discussed in Refs.\n\n[2, 3, 14], for a spherically symmetric system, the\n\nlaboratory-frame z axis, which is taken as the axis of quantization, can always be made\ncoincide with the body-fixed one, which is aligned with the direction of the total angular\nmomentum within the quantum mechanical uncertainty. Therefore the total angular momentum is completely determined by its z-projection M alone. For systems of an axially\nsymmetric oblate shape rotating about the symmetry axis, which in this case is the principal\nbody-fixed one, this noncollective motion is known as \"single-particle\" rotation. The pairing\nreentrance effect was originally obtained within the BCS theory in Refs. [2, 3] by considering\nsuch systems described by Hamiltonian (1). Its physical interpretation based on the thermal\neffect, which relaxes the tight packing of quasiparticles around the Fermi surface due to a\n5\n\n\flarge angle momentum M \u2265 Mc , and spreads them farther away from the Fermi level, fits\nwell in the framework of this \"single-particle\" rotation. However, as has been pointed out\nin Ref. [3], for non-spherical nuclei, and specifically in the case of axially symmetric ones,\nthe spin and angular momentum projections on the symmetry axis are not good quantum\nnumbers. In this case the formalism used here is not completed because it does not include\nthe angular momentum's component perpendicular to the symmetry axis. Cranking model\nmight serve as a better solution of the problem in this situation. This remains to be investigated because the results obtained within the Lipkin model with Jx cranking did not reveal\nany pairing reentrance so far [21]. On the other hand, in the region of high level densities\n(at high excitation energies and/or high T ) the values of angular momentum projection on\nthe symmetry axis will be mixed among the levels, which worsen the axial symmetry. The\nmelting of shell structure will also eventually drive nuclei to their average spherical shape.\n\nA.\n\nFTBCS1 equations at finite angular momentum\n\nThe FTBCS1 includes a set of FTBCS-based equations, corrected by the effects of\nquasiparticle-number fluctuations, for the level-dependent pairing gap \u2206k , average particle\nnumber N , and average angular momentum M . The derivation of the FTBCS1 equations\nwas reported in detail in Ref. [14], so we do present here only the final equations. The FTBCS1 equation for the pairing gap is written as a sum of two parts, the level-independent\npart \u2206 and the level-dependent part \u03b4\u2206k , namely\n\u2206k = \u2206 + \u03b4\u2206k ,\n\n(5)\n\nwhere\n\u2206=G\n\nX\n\n\u2212\nuk0 vk0 (1 \u2212 n+\nk 0 \u2212 nk 0 ) ,\n\n\u03b4\u2206k = G\n\nk0\n\n\u03b4Nk2\n\u2212 uk vk ,\n1 \u2212 n+\nk \u2212 nk\n\n(6)\n\nwhere\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\n\u000fk \u2212 Gvk2 \u2212 \u03bb\n=\n1+\n,\n2\nEk\nq\nEk = (\u000fk \u2212 Gvk2 \u2212 \u03bb)2 + \u22062k ,\nu2k\n\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u000fk \u2212 Gvk2 \u2212 \u03bb\n1\u2212\n,\nEk\n1\nn\u00b1\n, \u03b2 = 1/T .\nk =\n\u03b2(E\n1 + e k \u2213\u03b3mk )\n\nvk2\n\n1\n=\n2\n\n(7)\n\nwith the quasiparticle-number fluctuations \u03b4Nk2 at nonzero angular momentum\n+\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\u03b4Nk2 = (\u03b4Nk+ )2 + (\u03b4Nk\u2212 )2 = n+\nk (1 \u2212 nk ) + nk (1 \u2212 nk ) .\n\n6\n\n(8)\n\n\fThe corrections due to coupling to pair vibration beyond the quasiparticle mean field at\nfinite temperature and angular momentum are significant only in light nuclei like oxygen\nor neon isotopes, whereas they are negligible for medium and heavy nuclei (See Figs. 6 8 of Ref. [14]). As the present paper considers two medium nuclei,\n\n60\n\nNi and\n\n72\n\nGe, these\n\ncorrections on the FTBCS1 equations are neglected in the numerical calculations.\nThe equations for the particle number and total angular momentum are the same as Eqs.\n(25) and (26) of Ref. [14], namely\n\u0015\nX\u0014\n1 \u2020\n\u2212\n+\n\u2212\n2\nN =2\nvk (1 \u2212 nk \u2212 nk ) + (nk + nk ) ,\n2\nk\n\nM=\n\nX\n\n\u2212\nmk (n+\nk \u2212 nk ) .\n\n(9)\n\nk\n\nThe system of coupled equations (5) \u2013 (9) are called the FTBCS1 equations at finite angular\nmomentum.

The saddle-point approximation\ngives a good evaluation of the integral (11).

(25)-(35) of Ref.\n[3]. Within the FTBCS1, the grand-partition function has the same form as that given by\nEq. (14) of the FTBCS. Therefore, the first and second derivatives of the FTBCS1 grandpartition function are the same as those of the FTBCS ones. The only difference comes\nfrom the first derivatives of the pairing gap with respect to \u03b1, \u03bc, and \u03b2 because of the\nquasiparticle-number fluctuations in the FTBCS1 gap equation (6). In this case, instead of\nthe simple Eqs. [(33)-(35)] of Ref. [3], the derivatives become rather complicate expressions,\nwhich are obtained by taking the first derivatives of the left and right-hand sides of Eq. (6)\nwith respect to \u03b1, \u03bc, and \u03b2. Amongst the three derivatives of the FTBCS1 gap, \u2202\u2206k /\u2202\u03b2\ncan be obtained by using its definition, namely\n\u2202\u2206k\n\u2206k (T + \u03b4T ) \u2212 \u2206k (T )\n\u2202\u2206k\n= \u2212T 2\n= \u2212T 2\n,\n\u2202\u03b2\n\u2202T\n\u03b4T\n\n(15)\n\nand can be easily calculated numerically by choosing an appropriate value of \u03b4T as the\ninput parameter. The other two derivatives, \u2202\u2206k /\u2202\u03b1 and \u2202\u2206k /\u2202\u03bc, must be calculated from\ntheir explicit analytic expressions because \u03b1 and \u03b2 are two Lagrange multipliers, which are\nobtained by solving the FTBCS1 equations. The final equations for \u2202\u2206k /\u2202\u03b1 and \u2202\u2206k /\u2202\u03bc\nare derived as\nX\u0012\nk\n\n\u2202\u2206k\nAk \u03b2\n+ Bk\n\u2202\u03b1\n\n\u0013\n\n\u0012\n\u0013\n2\n\u2202\u2206k\n+\n\u2212\n+ Ck + Ck \u2212\n\u03b2\n+ (Dk+ + Dk\u2212 ) = 0 ,\nG\n\u2202\u03b1\n\n(16)\n\n\u0013 \u0012\n\u0013\nX\u0012\n2\n\u2202\u2206k\n0\n0\n0\n0 \u2202\u2206k\n+ Bk + Ck + Dk \u2212\n\u03b2\n+ Ek0 = 0 ,\nAk \u03b2\n\u2202\u03bc\nG\n\u2202\u03bc\nk\n\n(17)\n\nwhere\nAk =\n\n1 \b\n\u2212\n+ 2\n\u2212 2\n\u2212\n2 2 +\n(\u03bb \u2212 \u000fk )2 (1 \u2212 n+\nk \u2212 nk ) + \u03b2\u2206k Ek [nk + nk \u2212 2(nk ) \u2212 2(nk ) ]\nEk3\n\n,\n\n(18)\n\n\u2206k (\u03bb \u2212 \u000fk ) \b\n\u2212\n+\n\u2212\n+ 2\n\u2212 2\n2\n1 \u2212 n+\nk \u2212 nk \u2212 \u03b2Ek (nk + nk \u2212 2(nk ) \u2212 2(nk )\n3\nEk\n\n,\n\n(19)\n\nBk = \u2212\nCk+ =\n\n+\n\b\nn+\n+\n\u2212\n+\n\u2212\n+\n\u2212\n2\n2\n2\nk (1 \u2212 nk )\n,\n+\n\u2212 2 3 (\u03bb \u2212 \u000fk ) (1 \u2212 nk \u2212 nk ) \u2212 \u03b2\u2206k Ek [(nk \u2212 1) + nk (2nk \u2212 nk )]\n(1 \u2212 nk \u2212 nk ) Ek\n(20)\n\n8\n\n\f\u2212\n\b\nn\u2212\n+\n\u2212\n\u2212\n+\n\u2212\n+\n2\n2\n2\nk (1 \u2212 nk )\n,\n+\n\u2212 2 3 (\u03bb \u2212 \u000fk ) (1 \u2212 nk \u2212 nk ) \u2212 \u03b2\u2206k Ek [(nk \u2212 1) + nk (2nk \u2212 nk )]\n(1 \u2212 nk \u2212 nk ) Ek\n(21)\n+\n+\nn (1 \u2212 nk )\u2206k (\u03bb \u2212 \u000fk )\n\u2212\n+\n\u2212\n+\n\u2212\n2\n{1 \u2212 n+\n(22)\nDk+ = \u2212 k\nk \u2212 nk + \u03b2Ek [(nk \u2212 1) + nk (2nk \u2212 nk )]} ,\n+\n\u2212 2 3\n(1 \u2212 nk \u2212 nk ) Ek\n\nCk\u2212 =\n\nDk\u2212 = \u2212\n\n\u2212\nn\u2212\n\u2212\n\u2212\n+\n\u2212\n+\n2\nk (1 \u2212 nk )\u2206k (\u03bb \u2212 \u000fk )\n{1 \u2212 n+\nk \u2212 nk + \u03b2Ek [(nk \u2212 1) + nk (2nk \u2212 nk )]} ,\n\u2212 2 3\n(1 \u2212 n+\n\u2212\nn\n)\nE\nk\nk\nk\n\nA0k =\n\n(23)\n\n1\n+\n+\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\u2212\n2\n{(\u03bb \u2212 \u000fk )2 (1 \u2212 n+\nk \u2212 nk ) + \u03b2\u2206k Ek [nk (1 \u2212 nk ) + nk (1 \u2212 nk )]} ,\nEk3\n\n(24)\n\n\u03b2mk \u2206k +\n\u2212\n\u2212\n[nk (1 \u2212 n+\nk ) + nk (1 \u2212 nk )] ,\nEk\n\n(25)\n\n(\u03bb \u2212 \u000fk )2\n\u2212\n\u2212\n[n+ (1 \u2212 n+\nk ) + nk (1 \u2212 nk )] ,\n\u2212\n3 k\n(1 \u2212 n+\n\u2212\nn\n)E\nk\nk\nk\n\n(26)\n\nBk0 =\nCk0 =\nDk0 = \u2212\n\n\u03b2\u22062k\n+\n+\n+\n\u2212\n+\n\u2212\n2\n+\n\u2212 2 2 {nk (1 \u2212 nk )[(nk \u2212 1) + nk (2nk \u2212 nk )]\n(1 \u2212 nk \u2212 nk ) Ek\n\u2212\n\u2212\n+\n\u2212\n+\n2\n+ n\u2212\nk (1 \u2212 nk )[(nk \u2212 1) + nk (2nk \u2212 nk )]} ,\n\n(27)\n\n\u03b2mk \u2206k +\n\u2212\n\u2212\n[nk (1 \u2212 n+\nk ) + nk (1 \u2212 nk )] .\nEk\n\n(28)\n\nEk0 = \u2212\n\nBy solving first the FTBCS1 equations, then Eqs.

The\n\nlatter is considered in order to have a comparison with the results obtained within the\nSMMC approach in Ref. [17]. The single-particle spectra for these two nuclei are obtained\nwithin the axially deformed Woods-Saxon potential [22], whose parameters are chosen to be\nthe same as those given in Ref. [18]. All the bound (negative energy) single-particle states\nare used in the calculations. The quadrupole deformation parameters \u03b22 are equal to 0 and\n-0.224 for\n\n60\n\nNi and\n\n72\n\nGe, respectively. The pairing interaction parameters are adjusted so\n\nthat the pairing gaps at T = 0 fit the experimental values obtained from the odd-even mass\ndifferences. These values are GN = 0.347 MeV, which gives \u2206N = 1.7 MeV for neutrons in\n60\n\nNi and GN = 0.291 MeV, which gives \u2206N = 1.7 MeV for neutrons in\n\nin\n\n72\n\n72\n\nGe. For protons\n\nGe, the value GZ = 0.34 MeV is chosen to give \u2206Z = 1.5 MeV, whereas there is no\n\npairing gap for the closed-shell protons (Z = 28) in\n9\n\n60\n\nNi. Because the pairing gap (5) is\n\n\f \u0304 is considered, which is defined as \u2206\n \u0304 = P \u2206k /\u03a9\nlevel-dependent, the level-weighted gap \u2206\nk\nwith the total number \u03a9 of levels in the deformed basis [In the case of spherical basis it\n \u0304 = P (2j + 1)\u2206j / P (2j + 1) [14]].\nbecomes \u2206\nj\n\nj\n\n \u0304 the heat capacity C, and\nShown in Fig. 1 are the neutron level-weighted pairing gap \u2206,\nthe ratio C/T obtained as functions of T at several values of the total angular momentum\nM . The left column represents the predictions by the standard FTBCS, whereas the results\nobtained within the FTBCS1 are displayed in the right column. Both approaches show the\npairing reentrance in the gaps at M = 4 and 6 ~, namely the gap increases with T up to\nT ' 0.3 MeV, then decreases as T increases further. Because of the quasiparticle-number\nfluctuations, the FTBCS1 gap does not collapse at Tc as the FTBCS one, but decreases\nmonotonically at high T . At M = 14 ~, while the FTBCS gap completely vanishes at all T ,\nthe FTBCS1 gap shows a spectacular reentrance effect, namely it increases from the zero\nvalue at T = 0 up to around 0.3 MeV at T ' 0.8 MeV, and then slowly decreases as T\nfurther increases.\nThe heat capacities obtained within the FTBCS and FTBCS1 look alike, except for the\nregion around Tc , where the quasiparticle-number fluctuations smooth out the sharp SN\nphase transition so that the sharp local maximum is depleted to a broad bump. In the\nregion, where the pairing reentrance takes place, namely at T ' 0.3 MeV and M = 4 or\n6 ~, a weak local minimum is seen on the curve representing the temperature dependence\nof the heat capacity similarly to the feature reported in Ref. [17]. This local minimum is\nmagnified by using the ratio C/T so that the latter might be useful in experiments as a\nquantity to identify the pairing reentrance. However, when the gap is too small as in the\npairing reentrance at M = 14 ~, the heat capacity C (C/T ) obtained within FTBCS1 is\nalmost identical to that predicted by the FTBCS, where the gap is zero.\nFor 72 Ge, both neutron and proton gaps exist, which cause two peaks in the temperature\ndependence of the heat capacity obtained within the FTBCS, as shown in Fig. 2 (c).\nThe overall features of C and C/T for\n\n72\n\nGe are similar to those obtained for\n\n60\n\nNi. As\n\ncompared with the results of Ref. [17], where the same single-particle energies in the (0f 1p\u2212\n0g1d2s) shells were used for both neutrons and protons, and where the pairing reentrance\nwas predicted for neutrons, no pairing reentrance effect for neutrons is seen in the results of\nour calculations.

This is particularly clear for\n\n60\n\nNi by comparing the FTBCS1 predictions for the\n\nlevel density at M < 14 ~, which are convex functions of T , with that obtained at M =\n14 ~, which is a concave function of T . For\n\n72\n\nGe this trend is less obvious because of the\n\nexistence of proton and neutron pairing gaps with different values of Tc within the FTBCS.\nHowever, contrary to the result shown in the inset of Fig. 4 in Ref. [17], no pronounced local\nmaximum that might correspond to the pairing reentrance is seen here in the temperature\ndependence of the level density for 72 Ge. Since the results for the pairing gap, heat capacity,\nand level density strongly depend on the selected single-particle energies, the irregularity\nseen in the temperature dependence of the level density at \u03c9 = 0.5 MeV in the inset of Fig.\n4 of Ref. [17] might well be an artifact caused by using the same single-particle energies for\nboth neutron and proton spectra.\nTo show that it is indeed the case, we carried out the test calculations by using only the\n(0f 1p\u22120g1d2s) shells on top of the 40 Ca core with the values of Woods-Saxon neutron singleparticle energies adopted for both neutron and proton spectra of\n14\n\n72\n\nGe, as in Ref. [17]. The\n\n\fdifference now solely comes from that between the numbers of valence neutrons and protons\n(20 valence neutrons and 12 valence protons). The results of these test calculations within\nthe FTBCS1 are shown in Fig. 4. They show the pairing reentrance in the neutron pairing\ngap instead of the proton one, at low M . This is in qualitative agreement with the pairing\nreentrance predicted for neutrons in Fig. 2 of Ref. [17], where no proton pairing reentrance\nis seen up to \u03c9 = 0.5 MeV. In our calculations, however, the proton pairing reentrance takes\nplace at rather high M = 22 ~. In either case, the pairing reentrance is so strong that causes\nthe excitation energy E \u2217 to decrease slightly with increasing T at low T . This violates the\nsecond law of thermodynamics. As a consequence, at M \u2265 6 ~, the heat capacity becomes\nnegative at T < 0.4 MeV. The results for the level density remain essentially the same as\ncompared to those previously obtained by using all proton and neutron single-particle levels,\nbut with only bound-state single particle energies [Fig. 3 (d)], and no irregularities such\nas a pronounced local maximum are found. In our opinion, the pick on the dotted curve\nin the inset of Fig. 4 in Ref. [17] emerges because of the two lower values of ln\u03c1 at T '\n0.42 and 0.45 MeV. These two lower values are the results obtained by calculating the level\n\u221a\ndensity in the canonical ensemble \u03c1(E) = \u03b2eS / 2\u03c0C, making use of the two large values\nof C equal to around 16 and 28 (with large error bars). However, these large values of the\nheat capacity at low T are the artifacts of the SMMC calculations because the heat capacity\nmust be zero (or very small) at T = 0 (or very low T ) to avoid an infinite (or very large)\nentropy, which would violate the third law of thermodynamics. Therefore, we conclude that\nthe neutron pairing reentrance effect, reported in Ref. [17], is caused by the use of the same\nsingle-particle spectrum for both protons and neutrons, whereas the irregularity seen on the\ncurve of ln\u03c1 in the inset of Fig. 4 of Ref. [17] is caused by unphysically large values of the\nheat capacity at low T in the SMMC technique.\nThe present calculations within the FTBCS and FTBCS1 do not take into account the\neffects of residual interactions beyond the monopole pairing one. It is well known that\nthese effects are responsible for strong collective motion in finite nuclei, which leads to the\nincrease of nuclear level density. In spherical nuclei the collective enhancement of level\ndensity is caused by vibrational excitations, whereas in deformed nuclei it comes from the\ncollective rotation. The contribution of collective motion to the increase of nuclear level\ndensity has been studied in detail by Ignatyuk and collaborators starting from the early\n1970s [23, 24]. Because the Hamiltonian used in the SMMC calculations of Ref. [17] included\n15\n\n\fthe quadrupole-quadrupole interaction, let us estimate the effect of the collective quadrupole\nvibration on the increase of level density. By using the adiabatic approximation (3) of Ref.\n[24] for the enhancement coefficient Kvib due to quadrupole vibration, and the experimental\nenergies E(2+\n1 ) of the lowest quadrupole excitation in Ref. [25], we found Kvib ' 1.06\nand 1.94 for\n\n60\n\nNi at T = 0.3 MeV and\n\n72\n\nGe at T = 0.4 MeV, respectively. These values\n\nof T are those, at which the pairing reentrance starts to show up in these nuclei. With\nthe deformation parameter \u03b22 = -0.224 adopted in the present calculations for\n\n72\n\nGe and\n\nby using Eq. (9) of Ref. [26], we found the enhancement coefficient Kcoll (\u03b22 ) ' 1.96 for\n72\n\nGe at T = 0.4 MeV, whereas for the spherical nucleus,\n\nT = 0.3 MeV. Therefore, for both nuclei,\n\n60\n\nNi and\n\n72\n\n60\n\nNi, Kcoll = Kvib = 1.06 at\n\nGe, one can expect that the collective\n\nquadrupole enhancement of level density is not dramatic at the value of temperature, where\nthe pairing reentrance is supposed to take place. The contribution of collective motion\ngenerated by higher multipolarities to the increase of level density is expected to be much\nsmaller. In Ref. [27] the quasiparticle Tamm-Dancoff Approximation, which includes the\nisoscalar quadrupole-quadrupole interaction and Jx cranking, was used to calculate the level\ndensity within the microcanonical ensemble. The authors of Ref. [27] found 4 \u2264 Krot \u2264 6\nand 1.002 \u2264 Kvib \u2264 1.012 at excitation energy 3 \u2264 E \u2264 8 MeV (i.e. at around 0.38 \u2264 T \u2264\n0.63 MeV) for 162 Dy. They also found a monotonic decrease of the average pairing gap with\nincreasing the excitation energy up to E = 8.5 MeV (T ' 0.65 MeV), i.e. much higher than\nTc ' 0.34 MeV. These results are in good qualitative agreement with our estimations.\nFinally, it is worth noticing that the inclusion of the approximate particle-number projection within the Lipkin-Nogami method does not significantly alter the behavior of the paring\nreentrance obtained within the FTBCS1 theory (See Fig. 6 of Ref. [14]). This does not\ndiminish the value of an approach based on exact particle-number and angular momentum\nprojections. In Ref. [28] the exact solution of the nuclear shell model is used to study the\nSN phase transition including residual interactions other than the pairing one. The results\nof Ref. [28], which fully respect the particle number and angular momentum conservations,\nconfirm the presence of a long tail of pair correlations far beyond the BCS phase transition\nregion in agreement with the prediction by the FTBCS1. The approach of Ref. [28] does\nnot use any external heat bath, which determines the temperature of thermal equilibrium.\nTherefore the nuclear temperature can only be extracted from the level density by using the\nClausius definition of thermodynamic entropy. This task is not easy because of the discrete\n16\n\n\fand finite nuclear spectra (See, e.g. Ref. [15] and references therein). Nonetheless, instead\nof using temperature, it would be interesting to see if the pairing reentrance takes place in\nthe pair correlator as a function of excitation energy at various values of angular momentum\nwithin the method of Ref. [28].\n\nIV.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nThe present paper studies the temperature dependences of the heat capacity and level\ndensity in hot medium-mass nuclei, which undergo a noncollective rotation about the symmetry axis. The numerical calculations, carried out by using the realistic Woods-Saxon\nsingle-particle energies for\n\n60\n\nNi and\n\n72\n\nGe within the FTBCS and FTBCS1 theories, have\n\nshown the pairing reentrance in the pairing gap at finite angular momentum M and temperature T . Instead of decreasing with increasing T , the gap first increases with T then\ndecreases at higher T . It is demonstrated that the heat capacity C, or rather C/T , and level\ndensity \u03c1 can be used to experimentally identify the pairing reentrance effect. The pairing\nreentrance, when it occurs, leads to a clear depletion in the temperature dependence of the\nheat capacity, whereas the level density weakly changes from a convex function of T to a\nconcave one.\nRegarding the appearance of the local minimum in the heat capacity because of the\npairing reentrance, the results of the present paper agree with that of the SMMC calculations\nin Ref. [17]. However, the present results show no pronounced local maximum in the\ntemperature dependence of the level density. The pairing reentrance is seen in the proton\npairing gap of\n\n72\n\nGe at low M , whereas Ref. [17] reported this effect in the neutron pairing\n\nenergy. The test calculations by using the same single-particle configuration as that used\nin Ref. [17], but obtained within the Woods-Saxon potential, reveals that the neutron\npairing reentrance in\n\n72\n\nGe is an artifact, which is caused by the use of the same single-\n\nparticle spectrum for both protons and neutrons, whereas the irregularity on the curve for\nthe logarithm of level density, reported in Ref. [17], is caused by unphysically large values\nof the heat capacity at low T in the SMMC approach.\n17\n\n\fACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nThe numerical calculations were carried out using the FORTRAN IMSL Library by Visual Numerics on the RIKEN Integrated Cluster of Clusters (RICC) system.
