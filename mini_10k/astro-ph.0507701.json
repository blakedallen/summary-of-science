Among the theoretical aspects, we point out the impossibility of having a low\ninflationary energy scale in the simplest curvaton model. A couple of modifications\nto the simplest setup are explored, corresponding to the implementation of a second\n(thermal) inflationary period whose end makes the curvaton field 'heavy', triggering\neither its oscillations or immediate decay. Low scale inflation is then possible to attain with H\u2217 (the Hubble parameter a few Hubble times after horizon exit) being as\nlow as 1 TeV. Among the statistical aspects, we study the bispectrum B\u03b6 (k1 , k2 , k3 )\nof \u03b6 whose normalisation fNL gives information about the level of non-gaussianity\nin the primordial curvature perturbation. In connection with fNL , several conserved\nand/or gauge invariant quantities described as the second-order curvature perturbation have been given in the literature. We review each of these quantities showing\nhow to interpret one in terms of the others, and analyze the respective expected fNL\nin both the inflaton and the curvaton scenarios as well as in other less known models for the generation of primordial perturbations and/or non-gaussianities. The \u03b4N\nformalism turns out to be a powerful technique to compute fNL in multi-component\nslow-roll inflation, as the knowledge of the evolution of some family of unperturbed\nuniverses is the only requirement. We present for the first time this formalism and\napply it to selected examples.\n\n3\n\n\fContents\n1 Introduction\n\n7\n\n2 Two mechanisms for the origin of the large-scale structure\n2.1

cosmological model) [72, 186, 187, 188, 220] is the successful\nframework that describes the observed properties of the Universe: homogeneity and\nisotropy at large scales, Hubble expansion, and almost 14 billion years of evolution\nin agreement with globular clusters and radioactive isotopes dating. The additional\npredictions of the cosmic background radiation, confirmed by Penzias and Wilson's\ndiscovery in 1965 [46, 168], and the relative abundances of light elements [6, 7, 73,\n87, 165, 219, 221] in full agreement with observation, have established a solid base\nfor the study of the Universe throughout its history, turning the old speculative\ncosmology into well established and experimentally supported science [75].\nThe introduction of a period of exponential expansion (called inflationary) [5,\n79, 117], prior to the Big-Bang, brought an elegant solution to the horizon, flatness,\nand unwanted relics problems that were present in the original standard cosmological model [5, 79, 101, 117, 185]. The horizon problem, or why is the Cosmic\nMicrowave Background radiation (CMB) temperature highly isotropic?, was solved\nas the accelerated expansion blows up a region initially in thermal equilibrium to a\nmuch bigger size, making the horizon at the end of the matter dominated era be still\ninside that region; as a result all regions in the sky appear today at the same background temperature. The same accelerated expansion makes the comoving horizon\nshrink so rapidly that our local patch of the universe becomes extremely flat despite\nits actual topology, solving this way the flatness problem, or why is our observable\nUniverse almost perfectly flat?. The huge dilution of the abundances of unwanted\nrelics (e.g. topological defects: magnetic monopoles, cosmic strings, and domain\nwalls) caused by the exponential grow of the size of the Universe during inflation\nand the huge production of entropy by the decay of the scalar field that drives inflation, gave solution to the unwanted relics problem, or where are the topological\ndefects (and some other troublesome stuff ) predicted by the standard cosmology? 1 .\n1\n\nBe aware however that a minimum of inflationary expansion (at least 70 e-folds which correspond to a minimum of 10\u221236 seconds of inflation) is required to successfully solve the horizon,\nflatness, and unwanted relics problems, assuming standard evolution.\n\n7\n\n\fIn spite of its success at solving the above mentioned problems, the inflationary\nperiod became perhaps more important because of its ability to stretch the quantum\nfluctuations of the fields living in the FRW spacetime [12, 80, 84, 118, 162, 163, 185,\n210], making them classical [4, 78, 81, 122, 124] and almost constant soon after\nhorizon exit. They correspond to small inhomogeneities in the energy density and\nare responsible, via gravitational attraction, of the large-scale structure seen today\nin the Universe (see Figs. 1.1 and 1.2). If this scenario turned to be correct, the\nenergy density inhomogeneities should have left their trace in the CMB released\nat the time of recombination. Indeed, the Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE)\nin 1992 [206] found small anisotropies in the CMB temperature of the order of 1\npart in 105 (with average temperature T0 = 2.725 \u00b1 0.002 K [26]), on scales of order\nthousands of Megaparsecs. With 30 times better angular resolution and sensitivity\nthan COBE, the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) [223] confirmed\nthis picture in 2003 (see Fig. 1.3), measuring in turn the cosmological parameters\nwith a 1% order precision [207] on scales of order tens of Megaparsecs. The PLANCK\nsatellite [171], due to be launched in 2007, will be able to refine these observations\n(see Fig. 1.4). With 10 times better angular resolution and sensitivity than WMAP,\nPLANCK promises to determine the temperature anisotropies with a resolution of\nthe order of 1 part in 106 , and the cosmological parameters with a 0.1% order\nprecision.\nThe anisotropies in the CMB temperature2 \u03b4T /T0 are directly related to the\nperturbations in the energy density \u03b4\u03c1/\u03c10 at the time of recombination (SachsWolfe effect), whose primarily origin is the stretched quantum fluctuations of one or\nseveral scalar fields \u03c6i that fill the Universe during inflation [112, 191]3 :\n\u03b4T\nT0\n\n!\n\nk\n\n1 aH\n=\u2212\n2 k\n\u0012\n\n\u00132\n\n\u03b4\u03c1\n\u03c10\n\n!\n\n.\n\n(1.1)\n\nk\n\nThe perturbations in the energy density at the time of recombination can in turn\nbe quantified by the gauge-invariant primordial curvature perturbation \u03b6 [112, 191]:\n\u03b4\u03c1\n\u03c10\n\n!\n\nk\n\n2\n=\n5\n\nk\naH\n\n!2\n\n\u03b6k ,\n\n(1.2)\n\nwhich, on flat slices4 , can be expressed in terms of only the fluctuations in the fields\n\u03c6i . For instance, in the case of only one scalar field \u03c6 present during inflation,\n2\n\nFrom now on, and unless otherwise stated, the perturbation \u03b4y in any quantity y will be\nregarded as first-order in cosmological perturbation theory. Unperturbed quantities will be denoted\nby a subscript 0 unless otherwise stated.\n3\nIn Eqs. (1.1) and (1.2) all the quantities are evaluated at time of last scattering, being a the\nglobal expansion parameter and H \u2261 \u0227/a the global Hubble parameter. A dot means derivative\nwith respect to the cosmic time. The subscripts k stand for the fourier modes with comoving\nwavenumber k.\n4\nA choice of coordinates defines a threading of spacetime into lines of fixed spatial coordinates\nxi , and a slicing into constant time t hypersurfaces. The flat slices are defined such that the\nintrinsic spatial curvature (3) R vanishes in those hypersurfaces.\n\n8\n\n\fFigure 1.1: The 2-degree Field Galaxy Redshift Survey (2dFGRS) map [41]. The\n2dFGRS obtained spectra for 245591 objects, mainly galaxies. Reliable redshifts\nwere obtained for 221414 galaxies. The galaxies cover an area of approximately\n1500 square degrees selected from the extended APM Galaxy Survey in three regions: a north galactic pole strip, a south galactic pole strip and random fields\nscattered around the south galactic pole strip. The figure shows the map of the\ngalaxy distribution produced from the completed survey. The filamentary structure\ncan be qualitatively compared with that predicted by the Cold Dark Matter model\nwith dark energy (\u039bCDM model) (see Fig. 1.2) (Courtesy of the Anglo-Australian\nObservatory's 2dFGRS group [1]).\n\n\u03b6 [11, 12, 162, 163] is given by\n\u03b6 = \u2212Hinf\n\n\u03b4\u03c6\n,\n\u03c6\u03070\n\n(1.3)\n\nwhere Hinf is the global Hubble parameter during inflation. The curvature perturbation \u03b6 is a convenient quantity to describe the primordial perturbations since it\nis conserved on superhorizon scales (k \u226a aHinf ), as long as the pressure is a unique\nfunction of the energy density [127, 179, 222], and it is well defined even after the\nscalar fields \u03c6i have decayed. We will define \u03b6 in a rigorous way in Chapter 2.\nThe scalar fields \u03c6i we have been talking about might or might not have dominated the energy density during inflation and, therefore, driven the inflationary\n\n9\n\n\fRedshift z = 0 (t = 13.6 Gyr)\n\nRedshift z = 1.4 (t = 4.7 Gyr)\n\nRedshift z = 5.7 (t = 1.0 Gyr)\n\nRedshift z = 18.3 (t = 0.21 Gyr)\nFigure 1.2: These slices show the dark matter distribution in the Universe, based\non the Millennium Simulation [208]: the largest N-body simulation carried out thus\nfar (more than 1010 particles). By zooming in on a massive cluster of galaxies, the\nslices highlight the morphology of the structure on different scales, and the large\ndynamic range of the simulation (105 per dimension in 3D). The zoom extends\nfrom scales of a few Gpc down to resolved substructures as small as 100 Mpc.\nThe slices through the density field are all 15 Mpc/h thick, with h = 0.71 \u00b1 0.03\n[207]. For each redshift, three panels are displayed. Subsequent panels zoom in\nby a factor of four with respect to the previous ones. This filamentary structure\ncan be qualitatively compared with that observed by the 2-degree Field Galaxy\nRedshift Survey (see Fig. 1.1) (Courtesy of the Virgo Consortium for cosmological\nsupercomputer simulations [218]).\n10\n\n\fFigure 1.3: CMB temperature anisotropies as seen by the WMAP satellite [26]. The\noval shape is a projection to display the whole sky. The temperature anisotropies\nare found to be of the order of 1 part in 105 . The background temperature is\nT0 = 2.725 \u00b1 0.002 K; regions at that temperature are in very light blue. The\nhottest regions (in red) correspond to \u2206T = 200\u03bcK. The coldest regions (in very\ndark blue) correspond to \u2206T = \u2212200\u03bcK (Courtesy of the NASA/WMAP Science\nTeam [223]).\n\nstage prior to the Big-Bang5 . Our adopted definition for the inflaton field in this\nthesis will be the light field \u03c6 that dominates the energy density during inflation6\nand drives the exponential expansion. This field in most cases parameterises the\ndistance along the inflationary trajectories. Until recently, the most widely known\nand accepted scenario for the origin of the density perturbations identified the inflaton with the scalar field whose fluctuations were responsible for the primordial\ndensity perturbations. This scenario, called the inflaton scenario7 [5, 112, 117, 130],\ndescribes very well the properties of \u03b6, leading to an almost scale invariant power\n5\n\nAlthough the waterfall field in hybrid inflation dominates the energy density, it does not drive\ninflation. This is not in contradiction with our previous statement since, in the strict sense,\nthe waterfall field fluctuations are suppressed as the waterfall mass is much bigger than H\u2217 (the\nstar '\u2217' denoting the global Hubble parameter evaluated a few Hubble times after horizon exit)\n[112, 119, 120, 121, 130].\n6\nBy light field we mean a field \u03c6 whose mass m\u03c6 is much less than H\u2217 .\n7\nFor simplicity we will just consider single-component inflationary models of the slow-roll variety\nin the present introduction and in the following chapter. The multi-component case, which contains\none inflaton and one or more 'light non-inflaton fields', will be considered in Chapters 5 and 6.\n\n11\n\n\fFigure 1.4: Simulation of the CMB temperature anisotropies as seen by the\nPLANCK satellite.

We will discuss in more detail the inflaton scenario in\nChapter 2.\nAn alternative to the inflaton scenario is when the weakly coupled light field \u03c3,\nwhose fluctuations are responsible for the primordial density perturbations, does not\ndominate the energy density, and therefore does not drive inflation. This scenario\nis called the curvaton scenario [138, 139, 159] (see also Refs. [66, 116, 156]), and\nthe field \u03c3 receives the name curvaton. Introduced in 2002, this scenario describes\nalso very well the properties of \u03b6, with an almost scale invariant power spectrum\nP\u03b6 (k) \u2261 A2\u03b6 (k/aHinf )n\u03b6 whose spectral index n\u03b6 written as\n\nis function of \u03b5 and\n\u03b7\u03c3 \u2261\n\nn\u03b6 = 2\u03b7\u03c3 \u2212 2\u03b5 ,\n\n(1.18)\n\nm2P \u2202 2 V\nm2\u03c3\n\u226a 1,\n\u2248\nV \u2202\u03c302\n3H\u22172\n\n(1.19)\n\nbeing V the scalar potential, and whose amplitude A\u03b6 is given by H\u2217 , the unperturbed component of the curvaton field during inflation \u03c3\u2217 , and the fractional global\ncurvaton energy density \u03a9dec \u2261 \u03c1\u03c30 /\u03c1total0 just before the curvaton decay:\nA\u03b6 \u2243\n\nH\u2217 \u03a9dec\n.\n3\u03c0\u03c3\u2217\n\n(1.20)\n\nThe scale of inflation in the curvaton scenario, given by H\u2217 , does not depend on\n\u03b5 nor on \u03b7\u03c3 , instead it depends on the free parameters \u03c3\u2217 and \u03a9dec . A consequence from the previous expression is that there is no analogous to the consistency relation [c.f. Eq. (1.17)] for the curvaton scenario. However, there are distinctive non-gaussian signatures that can allow us to distinguish this model from\nother scenarios for the origin of the large-scale structure in the Universe (see below)\n[14, 17, 126, 131, 138]. The curvaton scenario will be studied in detail in Chapter 2.\nPerhaps the main motivation for the introduction of the curvaton scenario is\nthat it liberates the inflaton field from the generation of the primordial perturbations [49, 160, 161]. This is particularly good from the particle physics point of\nview since the intrinsic difficulty at embedding the inflaton scenario in a particle\nphysics model is greatly alleviated. Indeed, in the inflaton scenario, the energy\n< 1014 GeV) [123] in order to proscale of inflation is likely to be quite high9 (H\u2217 \u223c\nduce the required level of primordial perturbations |A\u03b6 | \u2248 5 \u00d7 10\u22125 [207]10 . This\n9\n\nThe upper bound on H\u2217 can be obtained from Eq. (1.6) and the current bound [207] on the\nslow-roll parameter \u03b5 <\n\u223c 0.01.\n10\nNevertheless there are examples where an \u03b5 parameter of order \u223c 10\u221224 is naturally obtained,\nso that the right amount of primordial perturbations is generated for H\u2217 \u223c 103 GeV (see e.g.\nRef. [177]).\n\n14\n\n\fmakes very difficult the identification of the inflaton field with one of the scalar\nfields present in the supersymmetry (SUSY) breaking sector or with one of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) flat directions. This is because the\ncharacteristic SUSY energy scale, which depends on the symmetry breaking scheme,\ngoes typically from H\u2217 \u223c 10\u22122 GeV to H\u2217 \u223c 105 GeV [125, 126]. In contrast, in the\n< 1012 GeV\ncurvaton scenario, the energy scale has to be much lower, satisfying H\u2217 \u223c\n[138, 139, 159], so that the inflaton field does not contribute to the curvature perturbation [c.f. Eq. (1.6)]11 . The last bound can be taken as an anti-smoking gun\nfor the curvaton scenario because a positive gravitational wave signal would require\n> 1012 GeV [85, 94, 95, 201, 202, 205], ruling out the curvaton as the source of\nH\u2217 \u223c\nprimordial density fluctuations. Some people can see this as a bad feature of the\nscenario in question as it sends an unpromising message to all those who are making\nbig efforts to detect gravitational waves. However, as described in Ref. [170], the\ncurvaton scenario may well be consistent with detectable gravitational waves as far\n> H\u2217 ), violating this way the slow-roll condition\nas the inflaton is a 'heavy' field (m\u03c6 \u223c\n12\n|\u03b7\u03c6 | \u226a 1 , and suppressing the amplitude of the curvature perturbation produced\nby the inflaton itself.\nOne of our main concerns in this thesis is the possibility to accommodate lowscale inflation in the curvaton scenario. Unfortunately, even when the energy scale\nmay in principle be greatly reduced compared to the inflaton scenario, the simplest curvaton model still requires a quite high inflationary energy scale satisfying\nH\u2217 > 107 GeV [126]. This of course makes impossible the embedding of the inflaton\nfield within the framework of a SUSY particle physics model. In Chapters 3 and 4 we\nexplore two modifications to the curvaton model which can instead allow inflation\nat a low scale [51, 149, 175, 189]. In the first modification [51] the end of a second\n(thermal) inflationary stage [108, 136, 137], driven by the rolling of a flaton field \u03c7\ncoupled to the curvaton, makes the curvaton mass m\u03c3 increase suddenly at some\nmoment after the end of inflation but before the onset of the curvaton oscillations.\nThis proposal can work but not in a completely natural way. Nevertheless, we show\nthat inflation with H\u2217 as low as 1 TeV or lower is possible to attain. In the second\nmodification [175, 189] the increment in m\u03c3 at the end of the thermal inflation era is\nso huge that the decay rate overtakes the Hubble parameter and the curvaton field\ndecays immediately. The advantage of this second modification is that low scale\ninflation is achieved for more natural values in the relevant parameter space.\nAside from the previously introduced theoretical aspects of the origin of the\nlarge-scale structure in the Universe, we also study some of its statistical aspects.\n11\n\nAn interesting scenario is when both the inflaton and the curvaton fields contribute to \u03b6\n[70, 105]. This is the case where the curvaton starts oscillating around the minimum of its potential\nwhen it already contributes significantly to the total energy density \u03c1total . The upper bound\n12\nH\u2217 <\n\u223c 10 GeV is, in this case, therefore relaxed. In this thesis we will consider only the standard\ncurvaton scenario, where the inflaton field does not contribute to \u03b6 and the curvaton oscillations\nbegin when the curvaton energy density \u03c1\u03c3 is still subdominant.\n12\nOf course, inflation in this case is not of the slow-roll variety. Some possibilities are fast-roll\n[115] or hilltop inflation [31].\n\n15\n\n\fConversely to the inflaton scenario [c.f. Eq. (1.12)], \u03b6 in the simplest curvaton model\nmay present a sizable non-gaussian component if the curvaton does not dominate\nthe energy density before decaying [14, 17, 131, 138]. More specifically, according\nto the expression\n5 5\n5\nfNL = + r \u2212\n,\n(1.21)\n3 6\n4r\nwhich is valid in the curvaton scenario, |fNL | \u226b 1 is obtained if r is very small. In\nthe previous expression r is defined by\nr\u2261\n\n3\u03c1\u03c30\n,\n4\u03c1r0 + 3\u03c1\u03c30\n\n(1.22)\n\nand is evaluated just before the curvaton decay (being \u03c1r the global radiation energy density). This is of extreme importance since the next WMAP data release\n[102, 103, 223], or in its defect the future PLANCK satellite data [103, 171], will either detect non-gaussianity or put strong constraints on fNL , offering the possibility\nof successfully discriminating among the different inflaton and curvaton models. The\n2\ncurrent constraint on fNL , according to the first-year WMAP data, is |fNL| <\n\u223c 10\n[102]. The next data release is expected to lower this bound by one order of magnitude or so [103].\nThe non-linearity parameter fNL , if independent of position, is closely related to\nthe second-order curvature perturbation \u03b62 defined by\n1\n\u03b6(x) \u2261 \u03b61 (x) + \u03b62 (x)\n2\n3\n\u2261 \u03b6g (x) \u2212 fNL (\u03b6g2(x) \u2212 h\u03b6g2i) ,\n5\n\n(1.23)\n\nwhere \u03b6g is gaussian with h\u03b6g i = 0. In connection with this issue we point out\nthat several conserved and/or gauge invariant quantities described as the secondorder curvature perturbation have been given in the literature [3, 140, 142, 145].\nIn Chapter 5 we revisit various scenarios for the generation of second-order nongaussianity in \u03b6, employing for the first time a unified notation and focusing on fNL\n[131]. When \u03b6 first appears a few Hubble times after horizon exit, |fNL | is much\nless than 1 and is, therefore, negligible. Thereafter \u03b6 (and hence fNL ) is conserved\nas long as the pressure is a unique function of the energy density (adiabatic pressure) [127, 179, 222]. Non-adiabatic pressure comes presumably only from the effect\nof fields, other than the one pointing along the inflationary trajectory, which are\nlight during inflation (light non-inflaton fields) [23, 77]. Our expectation is that,\nalthough during single-component inflation fNL is constant, multi-component inflation might generate |fNL | \u223c 1 or bigger. We mention some recent proposals where\nnon-gaussianity can be generated during the preheating stage following inflation\n[60, 61, 62], and conjecture that preheating can affect fNL only in atypical scenarios\nwhere it involves light non-inflaton fields [8, 24, 25, 62, 100]. We also study the curvaton scenario and derive Eq. (1.21), showing that the simplest model typically gives\n16\n\n\ffNL \u226a \u22121 or fNL = +5/4. The inhomogeneous reheating scenario [53, 54, 97] (see\nalso Refs. [65, 148, 150, 151, 216, 224]), where \u03b6 is generated by the inhomogeneities\nin the inflaton decay rate during reheating, is quickly reviewed showing that it can\ngive a wide range of values for fNL [216, 224]. One important conclusion from this\nchapter is that it will be crucial to calculate the precise observational limit on fNL\nusing second order theory in case that, unless there is a detection, observation could\neventually provide a limit |fNL| <\n\u223c 1 [103].\nA new and interesting proposal is the extension to second order of the \u03b4N formalism [196] (see also Refs. [210, 211]), used initially to calculate \u03b6 at first order\nand the spectral index in multi-component slow-roll models of inflation [196]13 . In\nthis formalism \u03b6(t, x) is expressed as the perturbation in the amount of expansion\n\"\n\n#\n\n\u00e3(t, x)\nN(t, x) \u2261 ln\n,\na(tin )\n\n(1.24)\n\nfrom an initially flat slice at time tin to a final slice of uniform energy density at\ntime t:\n\u03b6(t, x) = \u03b4N \u2261 N(t, x) \u2212 N0 (t) .\n(1.25)\nHere\n\n\"\n\n#\n\na(t)\n,\nN0 (t) \u2261 ln\na(tin )\n\n(1.26)\n\nis the unperturbed amount of expansion, and \u00e3(t, x) is the local expansion parameter. Thus, \u03b6 up to second order is given by\n\u03b6(t, x) =\n\nX\n\nN,i (t)\u03b4\u03c6i +\n\ni\n\n1X\nN,ij (t)\u03b4\u03c6i \u03b4\u03c6j ,\n2 ij\n\n(1.27)\n\nwhere\n\u2202N\n,\n\u2202\u03c6i0\n\u22022N\n,\n=\n\u2202\u03c6i0 \u2202\u03c6j0\n\nN,i =\nN,ij\n\n(1.28)\n(1.29)\n\nand the fields \u03c6i , evaluated a few Hubble times after horizon exit, are those relevant\nfor the generation of \u03b6. In view of Eq. (1.23), this presents as a powerful method\nto calculate fNL in any multi-component slow-roll inflationary model for the generation of \u03b6 [132]. In Chapter 6 we give for the first time this formalism, which\nallows us to extract all the stochastic properties of \u03b6 if the initial field perturbations\nare gaussian14 . The elegance and power of this method lies in the fact that the\n13\n\nFor an extension to multi-component non slow-roll models see Ref. [110].\nIn the case that the initial field perturbations are non-gaussian, there is an additional contribution to Eq. (1.30) which is strongly wavevector dependent [200]. This contribution is in any\n\u22122\ncase very small [141], being <\n\u223c 10 .\n14\n\n17\n\n\fcalculation requires only the knowledge of the evolution of some family of unperturbed universes. The following formula is given for fNL in terms of N(t, \u03c6i0 ) and\nits derivatives [32, 132]:\nA2\u03b6\nN,i N,j N,ij\n3\n\u2212 fNL = ijhP\ni2 + ln(kL)\n5\n2\n2 i N,i 2\nP\n\nP\n\nijk\n\nN,ij N,jk N,ki\n\nhP\n\n2\ni N,i\n\ni3\n\n,\n\n(1.30)\n\nwhere k \u22121 is a typical cosmological scale and L is the size of the region within which\nthe stochastic properties are specified, so that ln(kL) \u223c 1. We apply the above\nformula to the Kadota and Stewart modular inflation model [90, 91], the curvaton\nscenario [138, 139, 159], and the multi-component 'hybrid' inflation model of Enqvist\nand V\u00e4ihk\u00f6nen [67]. The relation of this formula to cosmological perturbation theory\nis also explained.\nThe conclusions of this thesis are drawn in Chapter 7.\n\n18\n\n\fChapter 2\nTwo mechanisms for the origin of\nthe large-scale structure\n2.1\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn the standard inflationary scenario [5, 112, 117, 130] a single scalar field, named the\ninflaton, is responsible for the solution of the horizon, flatness, and unwanted relics\nproblems, as well as for the origin of the large scale structure seen in the observable\nUniverse. This double mission for the inflaton field imposes strong constraints on\nthe parameters of the inflationary models, leading to big intrinsic difficulties at\nbuilding successful and realistic models of inflation [112, 130]. To rescue the well\nmotivated inflationary models that fail at generating the required level of primordial\nperturbations [49], the inflaton field is left in charge of driving inflation only. The\nother task, the generation of the primordial perturbations, is assigned to a weakly\ncoupled light field \u03c3 different from the inflaton. This is the curvaton scenario [138,\n139, 159] (see also Refs. [66, 116, 156]), where the original curvature perturbation \u03b6\u03c3 ,\nassociated to and produced by \u03c3 during inflation, is gradually transformed into the\ntotal curvature perturbation \u03b6 1 . The conversion process starts during the radiation\ndominated epoch that follows the reheating stage produced by the inflaton decay2 .\nThis chapter will give some preliminary definitions and basic facts about the\ninflaton and the curvaton scenarios, such as the first-order perturbations in the\nmetric, the precise definition of \u03b6, the slow-roll conditions, the characteristics of the\nspectrum of \u03b6 in both the inflaton and the curvaton scenarios, and the spectrum\nof gravitational waves and the consequences derived from its possible detection.\n1\n\nDuring inflation and until the start of the radiation dominated epoch just after reheating, \u03b6\u03c3\nis actually an isocurvature perturbation. The reason of the name isocurvature is because \u03b6\u03c3 during\nthat time does not contribute at all to the total curvature perturbation \u03b6.\n2\nThe cause of the conversion process is the relative redshifting between the radiation and the\ncurvaton fluid energy densities. The curvaton at this stage is considered a matter fluid since the\nperiod of its oscillations around the minimum of its potential is much less than the characteristic\nexpansion time scale [213]. This makes the average curvaton pressure essentially zero.\n\n19\n\n\fHaving this information at hand, it will be easier to follow the main discussions of\nthis thesis that are exposed in Chapters 3 to 6.\n\n2.2\n\nMetric perturbations and the primordial curvature perturbation \u03b6\n\nOur observable expanding Universe is well described as homogeneous and isotropic,\ndown to scales of order of tens of Megaparsecs. The FRW line element\ndr 2\nds2 = \u2212dt2 + a2 (t)\n+ r 2 d\u03b82 + r 2 sin2 \u03b8d\u03c62\n1 \u2212 \u03bar 2\n\n!\n\n,\n\n(2.1)\n\ndescribes such an Universe [72, 186, 187, 188, 220], assuming that the galaxies are\nalways at the same comoving spherical coordinates r, \u03b8, and \u03c6, and that the intergalactic space is continually increasing with time due to the expansion parameter\n(scale factor) a(t). The proper time, once synchronized in all the galaxies, runs at\nthe same rate everywhere, so the metric is well described by a global cosmic time t.\nFinally, the topology of the Universe can be classified by the parameter \u03ba as closed\n(\u03ba > 0), open (\u03ba = 0), or flat (\u03ba < 0), according to whether the space is finite but\nunbounded, infinite with certain curvature, or infinite but strictly flat a la Minkowski\n3\n. The inflationary stage however shrinks the comoving horizon so rapidly that the\npresent Universe looks so extremely flat. This makes the parameter \u03ba be completely\nirrelevant when going back in time, so that we can safely discard it when studying the inflationary and early Universe processes. Thus, and switching to cartesian\ncoordinates xi and conformal time \u03b7 defined by d\u03b7 \u2261 dt/a, the FRW line element\nlooks\n\u0011\n\u0010\n(2.2)\nds2 = a2 (\u03b7) \u2212d\u03b7 2 + \u03b4ij dxi dxj .\n\n2.2.1\n\nFirst-order perturbations in the FRW line element:\nclassification and number of degrees of freedom\n\nThe homogeneity and isotropy assumptions make a good description of the Universe,\nbut they are not in any case perfect conditions. The observed galaxy distribution\nand the temperature fluctuations in the CMB (see Figs. 1.1 - 1.4) reveal the importance of modifying the FRW line element so that it accounts for the small deviations\nfrom homogeneity and isotropy required to correctly describe such large-scale structures. The introduction of small inhomogeneities in the FRW line element, and the\ntruncation at first-order of the perturbed Einstein equations, are well justified since\nthe galaxy density contrast \u03b4\u03c1/\u03c10 and the CMB temperature anisotropies \u03b4T /T0\nare observed to be of order 10\u22125 [26, 104, 169]. In consequence, considering only\n3\n\nThe actual value of \u03ba is conventional since it depends on the chosen value for the present\nexpansion parameter atoday .\n\n20\n\n\fscalar degrees of freedom, the most generic first-order perturbed line element reads\n[11, 96, 143, 162, 163, 185, 195]\ni\n\nh\n\nds2 = a2 (\u03b7) \u2212(1 + 2\u03c6G )d\u03b7 2 + 2 \u2202i B d\u03b7dxi + ((1 \u2212 2\u03c8)\u03b4ij + Dij E)dxi dxj ,\n\n(2.3)\n\nwhere Dij \u2261 \u2202i \u2202j \u2212 (1/3)\u03b4ij \u22072 , and \u03c6G , B, \u03c8, and E are scalar quantities.\nThe peculiar form of the perturbed line element in Eq. (2.3), as well as the right\nnumber of scalar degrees of freedom in that expression, are justified as follows:\n\u2022 The full perturbed metric tensor is generically described by scalar, vector, and\ntensor perturbations.\n\u2022 The total number of degrees of freedom for a symmetric tensor in an (n + 1)dimensional spacetime is (n + 2)(n + 1)/2.\n\u2022 The g00 entry can be written as \u2212(1 + 2\u03c6G ), where \u03c6G corresponds to a purely\nscalar perturbation (1 scalar degree of freedom).\n~ * ~\u03c5 = 0.\n\u2022 The g0i entries can be parameterised by Bi \u2261 \u2202i B + \u03c5i , where \u2207\nThe term \u2202i B corresponds to a purely scalar perturbation (1 scalar degree of\nfreedom). The term \u03c5i corresponds to a purely vector perturbation (n \u2212 1\n~ * ~\u03c5 = 0 constraint).\nvector degrees of freedom because of the \u2207\n\u2022 The gij entries can be written as (1 \u2212 2\u03c8)\u03b4ij + \u03a0ij , where \u03c8 is a purely scalar\nperturbation (1 scalar degree of freedom) that accounts for the trace of gij ,\nand \u03a0ij is a symmetric traceless tensor.\n\u2022 \u03a0ij = \u03a0Sij + \u03a0Vij + \u03a0Tij is expressed in terms of a purely scalar perturbation\n(encoded in \u03a0Sij ), a purely vector perturbation (encoded in \u03a0Vij ), and a purely\ntensor perturbation (encoded in \u03a0Tij ).\n\u2022 \u03a0Sij can be written as Dij E because it is a symmetric traceless tensor corresponding to the purely scalar perturbation E (1 scalar degree of freedom).\n\u2022 \u03a0Vij can be written as (\u2202i \u03a0j +\u2202j \u03a0i )/2, where \u03a0i is a purely vector perturbation\n~ *\u03a0\n~ = 0 (n \u2212 1 vector degrees of freedom).\nsatisfying \u2207\n\u2022 \u03a0Tij corresponds to a purely tensor perturbation such that \u2202i \u03a0Tij = 0. Considering the previous three items, and the fact that the number of degrees of\nfreedom coming from a traceless symmetric tensor in an n-dimensional space\nis (n + 1)n/2 \u2212 1, the number of tensor degrees of freedom is (n \u2212 2)(n + 1)/2.\n\u2022 The total number of scalar degrees of freedom (4), vector degrees of freedom\n(2(n\u22121)), and tensor degrees of freedom ((n\u22122)(n+1)/2), add up to reproduce\nthe total number of degrees of freedom of the metric tensor g\u03bc\u03bd given in the\nsecond item: (n + 2)(n + 1)/2.\n21\n\n\fTwo very important facts follow from the first-order perturbed Einstein equations\n[11, 96, 143, 163]. First, at first order the vector perturbations are decoupled from\nthe scalar perturbations being anyway usually neglected due to their rapid decrease\nwith time. Second, the tensor perturbations at first order also decouple from their\nscalar counterparts. These two facts, along with the parameterisation of the metric\ntensor discussed in the above items, justify the use of the Eq. (2.3) as the most\ngeneric first-order metric perturbed line element that describes the energy density\n(scalar) perturbations in the FRW spacetime.\n\n2.2.2\n\nThe curvature perturbation \u03c8 and its non-invariance\nunder infinitesimal coordinate transformations\n\nIn the perturbed line element of Eq. (2.3), \u03c8 represents the intrinsic spatial curvature\n(3)\nR on hypersurfaces of constant conformal time \u03b7 [11]:\n(3)\n\nR=\n\n4 2\n\u2207 \u03c8,\na2\n\n(2.4)\n\nwhere the operator \u22072 is the comoving Laplacian operator. For this reason the\nquantity \u03c8 is usually referred to as the curvature perturbation. The curvature perturbation \u03c8, as well as the other scalar perturbations \u03c6G , B, and E, are however\nnot invariant under a coordinate transformation. Indeed, from the most general\ninfinitesimal coordinate transformation4\n\u03b7 \u2192 \u03b7 + \u03be(x\u03bc ) ,\nxi \u2192 xi + \u2202i \u03b2(x\u03bc ) ,\n\n(2.5)\n(2.6)\n\nthe scalar perturbations \u03c6G , B, \u03c8, and E transform as [11]\n\u03c6G \u2192 \u03c6G \u2212 \u03be \u2032 \u2212 H\u03be ,\nB \u2192 B + \u03be \u2212 \u03b2\u2032 ,\n1\n\u03c8 \u2192 \u03c8 + \u22072 \u03b2 + H\u03be ,\n3\nE \u2192 E \u2212 2\u03b2 ,\n\n(2.7)\n(2.8)\n(2.9)\n(2.10)\n\nwhere a prime means derivation with respect to the conformal time \u03b7, and H is the\nglobal conformal Hubble parameter defined by H \u2261 a\u2032 /a. The above transformation\nrules are under the physical proviso that the perturbed line element ds2 in Eq. (2.3)\nshould remain invariant.\nThe parameters \u03be and \u03b2 that give account of the infinitesimal coordinate transformation in Eqs. (2.5) and (2.6) can be adjusted (fixing the slicing and the threading)\n4\n\nThe vector component that should appear in the transformation of xi has been discarded. This\nis because the infinitesimal first-order vector shifts contribute to the transformation rules of the\nvector perturbations only.\n\n22\n\n\fso that two of the four scalar perturbations in Eqs. (2.7) to (2.10) vanish. The\nlongitudinal gauge, for instance, corresponds to choose B and E equal to zero. In\nthis specific gauge the gravitational potential \u03c6G becomes equal to the curvature\nperturbation \u03c8 up to first order [96, 143, 162, 163, 185] as long as the considered\nfluid is described by a perfect isotropic stress, examples of such a fluid being the\ninflaton and/or the curvaton fields. All of this leads us to say with confidence that\nthe curvature perturbation \u03c8 really represents the effect of the inhomogeneities in\nthe FRW spacetime and it is, therefore, the quantity to study.\n\n2.2.3\n\nThe gauge-invariant curvature perturbation \u03b6\n\nTo parameterise adequately the inhomogeneities in the FRW spacetime, we need a\nquantity invariant under the coordinate (gauge) transformations in Eqs. (2.5) and\n(2.6). This is not completely possible to do, but we may define a quantity which is\ninvariant under transformations in time only. This is done taking into account that,\nfor any scalar quantity f (x\u03bc ) different to \u03c6G , B, \u03c8, and E, the transformation law\nin the associated perturbation \u03b4f (x\u03bc ) is given by\n\u03b4f \u2192 \u03b4f \u2212 f0\u2032 \u03be .\n\n(2.11)\n\nThe first gauge invariant quantity that we may define is that which represents the\ncurvature perturbation \u03c8 in the comoving slices, defined them as the constant time\nhypersurfaces where there is no flux of energy. Considering the inflaton field \u03c6, the\ncomoving slices coincide with those where \u03c6 is uniform (\u03b4\u03c6com = 0) [96, 127, 163, 222]\nso that the time translation \u03becom (x\u03bc ) required to go from a generic slice to the\ncomoving slice is:\n1\n\u03b4\u03c6\n\u03becom = \u2032 [\u03b4\u03c6 \u2212 \u03b4\u03c6com ] = \u2032 .\n(2.12)\n\u03c60\n\u03c60\nTherefore the comoving curvature perturbation \u03c8com , denoted from now on as \u2212\u03b6,\nis written in terms of \u03c8 and \u03c6 in the generic slice as\n\u03b6 = \u2212\u03c8 \u2212 H\u03becom\n\u03b4\u03c6\n= \u2212\u03c8 \u2212 H \u2032 .\n\u03c60\n\n(2.13)\n\nThe overall minus sign is just a convention, chosen in this thesis to match the agreed\ndefinition of \u03b6 by most of the authors.\nThe second gauge invariant quantity that we may define represents the curvature\nperturbation \u03c8 in the slices of uniform energy density. Again, and following the\nsame steps as before, we have to consider the infinitesimal time translation \u03beuni (x\u03bc )\nrequired to go from a generic slice to the uniform energy density slice where \u03b4\u03c1uni = 0:\n\u03beuni =\n\n\u03b4\u03c1\n1\n[\u03b4\u03c1 \u2212 \u03b4\u03c1uni ] = \u2032 .\n\u2032\n\u03c10\n\u03c10\n23\n\n(2.14)\n\n\fThus, the curvature perturbation in the uniform density slice \u03c8uni , denoted from\nnow on as \u2212\u03b6, is given by\n\u03b6 = \u2212\u03c8 \u2212 H\u03beuni\n\u03b4\u03c1\n= \u2212\u03c8 \u2212 H \u2032 .\n\u03c10\n\n(2.15)\n\nWe have chosen to denote both the comoving and the uniform density slice curvature\nperturbations with the same letter \u03b6 because they are equivalent on superhorizon\nscales (k \u226a aHinf ) [11]. The superhorizon scale region is of great importance because\n\u03b6 is conserved in that region if the adiabatic condition, described below, is satisfied.\nIn addition, at superhorizon scales \u03b6 becomes truly gauge-invariant because the\ncontribution of \u03b2 in Eq. (2.9) gets suppressed by the spatial derivatives, so that \u03c8\ndoes not depend on the changes in the threading5 .\nThe conservation of \u03b6 is guaranteed as long as the pressure P is a unique function\nof the energy density \u03c1 (the adiabatic condition). The last statement follows from\nthe local energy conservation equation in the uniform density slicing at large scales\n[127, 179, 222]:\n\u03c1\u0307(t) = \u22123(H + \u03b6\u0307)[\u03c1(t) + P (t, x)] .\n(2.16)\nIf P satisfies the adiabatic condition then it becomes spatially uniform (\u03b6 = h\u03b6i),\nand so does \u03b6\u0307.

The inflationary stage prior to the\nHot Big-Bang has the nice property to stretch the quantum fluctuations of the scalar\nfields living in the FRW spacetime [12, 80, 84, 118, 162, 163, 185, 210], so that they\nbecome classical [4, 78, 81, 122, 124] and almost constant, sourcing the primordial\ndensity inhomogeneities responsible for the presently observed large-scale structure.\nThe amplitude of the spectrum of the classical field perturbations (for light fields)\nis generically the same for all kinds of quasi de Sitter models. However, the spectral\nindex is written down in a certain way for fields that dominate the energy density\nand in another way for fields that do not. In this section we will describe inflation,\npaying special attention to the constraint imposed by it on the slow-roll parameter\n\u03b5, and review the properties of the power spectrum of perturbations of a massless\nscalar field during a de Sitter stage, characterized the latter by a constant Hubble\nparameter Hinf = H\u2217 during inflation.\n\n2.3.1\n\nInflation\n\nInflation can be rigorously defined as the period when the global expansion parameter a satisfies the condition\n\u00e4 > 0 .\n(2.20)\nSuch a condition translates into a definite requirement on the global Hubble parameter during inflation Hinf . From the definition of Hinf in terms of a, which can be\nwritten alternatively as the following evolution equation:\na(t) = aini exp\n\n\u0012Z\n\nt\ntini\n\n\u0013\n\nHinf dt ,\n\n(2.21)\n\nbeing aini the expansion parameter at some time tini , the inflationary condition in\nEq. (2.20) is satisfied while\n2\n\u1e22inf > \u2212Hinf\n.\n(2.22)\nThe last expression reduces to an upper bound on the slow-roll parameter \u03b5 defined\nin Eq. (1.8):\n!\n\u1e22inf\n\u03b5\u2261\u2212\n< 1.\n(2.23)\n2\nHinf\n\u2217\nInflation is held as long as \u03b5 < 1, being one possibility when Hinf is constant in\ntime. This scenario is commonly recognized as the de Sitter stage, and it will be\nuseful at studying the spectrum of perturbations of a massless scalar field. Other\npossibilities correspond to nonvanishing values for \u1e22inf , being the quasi de Sitter\n25\n\n\fcase (\u03b5 \u226a 1) the most popular. Indeed, the quasi de Sitter stage supplemented by\nthe condition |\u03b7\u03c6 | \u226a 1, being \u03b7\u03c6 the slow-roll parameter defined in Eq. (1.9), is\nwhat is known as slow-roll inflation. This variety of inflation will be discussed in\nSubsection 2.5.1. Meanwhile in the following subsection, we will study the fluctuations of a non-dominating massless scalar field during a de Sitter stage. Later on we\nwill generalise these results to the fluctuations of non-dominating and dominating\nmassive scalar fields in a quasi de Sitter stage.\n\n2.3.2\n\nSpectrum of perturbations of a non-dominating massless scalar field during a de Sitter stage\n\nIn this subsection we will consider the effects of a de Sitter inflationary stage on\nthe fluctuations of a massless scalar field that does not dominate the energy density.\nLet's call this field \u03c6. During inflation, and before horizon exit, the fluctuations in\n\u03c6 can still be regarded as quantum operators. If we further assume that \u03c6 is almost\na non-interacting field, we can write down the field perturbation operator \u03b4 \u03c6\u0302(x, t)\nin terms of the usual creation and annihilation operators \u00e2\u2020k and \u00e2k :\n\u03b4 \u03c6\u0302(x, t) =\n\nZ\n\nd3 k\nexp(ik * x)\u03b4 \u03c6\u0302k (t) ,\n(2\u03c0)3/2\n\n(2.24)\n\nwhere\n\u03b4 \u03c6\u0302k (t) \u2261 \u03c9k (t)\u00e2k + \u03c9k\u2217 (t)\u00e2\u2020\u2212k .\n\n(2.25)\n\nAs it was discussed in the introduction of this thesis, the properties of the primordial curvature perturbation \u03b6 are specified by the spectrum P\u03b6 (k), which is defined\nby the statistical average h\u03b6k1 \u03b6k2 i over an ensemble of universes. The same definition\ncan be applied for the perturbations in \u03c6, so that the only information we need to\nknow to calculate P\u03b4\u03c6 (k) is the quantum state of the Universe during inflation, being\nthe most reasonable choice the vacuum state6 . Since the universes in the ensemble\nare all in the vacuum state during inflation, the statistical average h\u03b4\u03c6k1 \u03b4\u03c6k2 i is now\nvery easy to calculate corresponding to the expectation value h0|\u03b4 \u03c6\u0302k1 \u03b4 \u03c6\u0302k2 |0i. It is\nstraightforward then to recognize that the spectrum P\u03b4\u03c6 (k) of the \u03b4\u03c6 perturbations,\ndefined by\n2\u03c0 2\n(2.26)\nh\u03b4\u03c6k1 \u03b4\u03c6k2 i \u2261 3 \u03b4 3 (k1 + k2 )P\u03b4\u03c6 (k) ,\nk\nis given by the simple formula\nk3\n|\u03c9k |2 .\n(2.27)\n2\u03c0 2\nTo calculate |\u03c9k | we need to solve the Klein-Gordon equation for the fluctuations\nin \u03c6. The usual Klein-Gordon equation\nP\u03b4\u03c6 (k) =\n\n\u03c9\u0308k + 3H\u2217 \u03c9\u0307k +\n6\n\nk2\n\u03c9k = 0 ,\na2\n\nThe vacuum state guarantees the homogeneity and isotropy in the whole space.\n\n26\n\n(2.28)\n\n\fis only applicable if the inflaton field (that which dominates the energy density) is\nunable to generate significant primordial perturbations. That guarantees that the\nline element in Eq. (2.2) is not modified by any scalar perturbation as \u03c6 is assumed\nnot to dominate the energy density during inflation. As a consequence, the usual\nstructure of the Klein-Gordon equation is unmodified.\nEq. (2.28) is easily solved by making the following change of variables:\n\u03c9k \u2261\n\n\u03bbk\n,\na\n\n(2.29)\n\nand going to conformal time where the expansion parameter in a de Sitter stage\n(Hinf being constant)\na(t) = aini exp[H\u2217 (t \u2212 tini )] ,\n(2.30)\nis given by\n\n1\n,\n(2.31)\nH\u2217 \u03b7\nwith conformal time \u03b7 taking negative values. Thus, the Klein-Gordon equation in\nEq. (2.28) reduces to\n!\n2\n(2.32)\n\u03bb\u2032\u2032k + k 2 \u2212 2 \u03bbk = 0 ,\n\u03b7\na(\u03b7) = \u2212\n\nwhose exact solution is\nexp(\u2212ik\u03b7)\ni\n\u221a\n\u03bbk =\n1\u2212\nk\u03b7\n2k\n\n!\n\n.\n\n(2.33)\n\nThe reader might worry about the fact that Eq. (2.33) is valid up to a multiplicative constant. To solve this ambiguity we note that in the subhorizon regime\n(k \u226b aHinf ) Eq. (2.32) reproduces the Klein-Gordon equation for a massless scalar\nfield in Minkowski spacetime. The solution for \u03bbk in Eq. (2.33) satisfies the Bunch\nand Davies normalisation [30, 37] on subhorizon scales, so that no integration constant should amplify it.\nThe subhorizon regime is useful in the sense that we can find the adequate\nsolution and normalisation for \u03bbk . However, the superhorizon regime (k \u226a aHinf ) is\nmuch more interesting because \u03b6 defined in that regime is truly gauge invariant and\nconserved as long as the pressure satisfies the adiabatic condition. From Eqs. (2.29),\n(2.31), and (2.33), the magnitude of the mode function \u03c9k for superhorizon scales\nturns out to be constant and it is given by\nH\u2217\n|\u03c9k | \u2248 \u221a\n.\n2k 3\n\n(2.34)\n\nThe latter expression allows us to obtain the spectrum of perturbations in \u03c6, given\nby Eq. (2.27):\n\u0013\n\u0012\nH\u2217 2\n.\n(2.35)\nP\u03b4\u03c6 (k) \u2248\n2\u03c0\n27\n\n\fAs we can see, the spectrum P\u03b4\u03c6 (k) of the perturbations of a massless scalar field\n\u03c6 in a de Sitter stage is constant and scale invariant. We will see later on that the\nprevious amplitude is generically the same for any kind of quasi de Sitter model\nas far as we deal with light fields. A possible scale dependence will arise if the\nfield under consideration has a finite mass and/or if the inflationary stage is not\ncompletely de Sitter (\u1e22inf 6= 0).\n\n2.4\n\nThe curvaton scenario: an example of a nondominating light scalar field during a quasi de\nSitter stage\n\nIn the previous section we described the spectrum of perturbations of a non-dominating massless scalar field during an inflationary period with Hinf being constant (de\nSitter stage). Now we move a step ahead considering a non-dominating scalar field\n\u03c3 whose mass m\u03c3 satisfies m\u03c3 \u226a H\u2217 (light field), during an inflationary period\nwhere the Hubble parameter Hinf is not constant but evolves slowly satisfying the\n2\ncondition \u2212\u1e22inf /Hinf\n\u226a 1 so that \u03b5 \u226a 1 (quasi de Sitter stage). We will see that the\nintroduction of a slowly varying Hinf and a small mass m\u03c3 for the field \u03c3 results in\na small scale dependence for P\u03b4\u03c3 (k) which is parameterised by \u03b5 and \u03b7\u03c3 \u2261 m2\u03c3 /3H\u22172 .\nThe amplitude of P\u03b4\u03c3 (k) will turn out to be the same as that for a non-dominating\nmassless scalar field in a de Sitter stage, which was the case described in Subsection\n2.3.2. This example will help us to understand the properties of the curvature\nperturbation produced in one of the most satisfying models proposed to explain the\norigin of the large-scale structure in the Universe: the curvaton scenario.\n\n2.4.1\n\nSpectrum of perturbations of a non-dominating light\nscalar field during a quasi de Sitter stage\n\nThe calculation of the spectrum of perturbations of a non-dominating light scalar\nfield \u03c3 during a quasi de Sitter stage closely resembles that done in Subsection 2.3.2.\nWe will now have to consider the mass m\u03c3 of \u03c3 and the running of Hinf given by\nthe slow-roll parameter \u03b5. Since the inflaton field is supposed to produce negligible\ncurvature perturbation, and \u03c3 does not dominate the energy density during inflation,\nthe line element is still given by Eq. (2.2). This means that the Klein-Gordon\nequation for the mode functions \u03c9k does not change compared with that for the\nmode functions of the background component of \u03c3:\nk2\n\u03c9\u0308k + 3Hinf \u03c9\u0307k + 2 + m2\u03c3 \u03c9k = 0 .\na\n!\n\n(2.36)\n\nIn the quasi de Sitter stage the expansion is almost exponential; nevertheless it\n\n28\n\n\fis better described by the following evolution equation:\na(t) = aini [1 + Hinf (tini )\u03b5(t \u2212 tini )]1/\u03b5 ,\n\n(2.37)\n\nwhere Hinf (tini ) is the Hubble parameter at the time tini . The last expression can be\nwritten down using the conformal time \u03b7 in an easier way:\na(\u03b7) = \u2212\n\n1\n,\nHinf (\u03b7)\u03b7(1 \u2212 \u03b5)\n\n(2.38)\n\nhaving in mind that \u03b7 takes negative values.

This is\ngiven by the following approximation for the Hankel's function of the first kind on\nsuperhorizon scales [35, 185, 195]\n(\u2212k\u03b7\nH\u03c5(1)\n\u03c3\n\n\u226a 1) \u2248\n\ns\n\n2\n\u03c0 \u03c5\u03c3 \u2212 3 \u0393(\u03c5\u03c3 )\n2 2\nexp \u2212i\n(\u2212k\u03b7)\u2212\u03c5\u03c3 .\n\u03c0\n2\n\u0393(3/2)\n\u0013\n\n\u0012\n\n(2.49)\n\nThe magnitude of the mode function \u03c9k on superhorizon scales is then almost constant and approximately given by\n|\u03c9k | \u2248 [2(1 \u2212 \u03b5)]\nH\u2217\n\u2248 \u221a\n2k 3\n\n\u0393(\u03c5\u03c3 ) Hinf\n\u221a\n(1 \u2212 \u03b5)\n\u0393(3/2) 2k 3\n\n\u03c5\u03c3 \u2212 23\n\nk\naHinf\n\n!\u03b7\u03c3 \u2212\u03b5\n\nk\naHinf\n\n.\n\n! 3 \u2212\u03c5\u03c3\n2\n\n(2.50)\n\nwhere we have used the relation involving \u03c5\u03c3 , \u03b5, and \u03b7\u03c3 , established in Eq.

Eq. (2.35)], we see that the\namplitude of P\u03b4\u03c3 (k) is exactly the same for both cases, but now we have a small\nscale dependence parameterised by the slow evolution of Hinf and the mass m\u03c3 of\nthe light field \u03c3, characterized by the smallness of the parameters \u03b5 and \u03b7\u03c3 .\n30\n\n\f2.4.2\n\nThe curvaton scenario\n\nIn the basic curvaton setup the Hubble parameter during inflation Hinf is assumed\nto be slowly varying (\u03b5 \u226a 1), the curvaton energy density \u03c1\u03c3 during inflation is\nassumed to be negligible, and the inflaton field is supposed to produce a negligible\ncurvature perturbation \u03b6r [138, 139, 159] which is imprinted to the radiation fluid\nwhile the inflaton decays. After the end of inflation the Universe is composed by the\nalmost unperturbed radiation fluid that originates from the reheating process following the inflaton decay, and the weakly coupled [47] light curvaton field \u03c3 8 whose\nunperturbed component is kept frozen at a value \u03c3\u2217 until the Hubble parameter\nH becomes of the order of the curvaton mass m\u03c3 during the radiation dominated\nepoch. Once \u03c3 is unfrozen, it begins oscillating around the minimum of its potential,\nwhich is taken to be quadratic, with an oscillation period which rapidly becomes\nmuch less than the characteristic expansion time scale. This ensures that the average curvaton pressure vanishes and, therefore, \u03c3 may be considered as a matter fluid\n[213]. During the oscillatory period, the curvaton energy density \u03c1\u03c3 decreases with\ntime according to \u03c1\u03c3 \u221d a\u22123 , while the radiation energy density \u03c1r decreases with\ntime faster than \u03c1\u03c3 according to \u03c1r \u221d a\u22124 . Eventually the curvaton will decay, but\nby that time the contribution of \u03c1\u03c3 to the total energy density will be big enough\nfor the original isocurvature perturbation \u03b6\u03c3 , generated by \u03c3 during inflation and\nwhich is not negligible, to become the total curvature perturbation \u03b6.\nSince the oscillations of \u03c3 around the minimum of its potential are so fast, we\ncan approximate its energy density by\n1\n\u03c1\u03c3 (t, x) \u2248 m2\u03c3 \u03c3a2 (t, x) ,\n2\n\n(2.53)\n\nwhere \u03c3a (t, x) is the amplitude of the oscillations. Notice that, under these circumstances, the expression for the curvaton energy density in Eq. (2.53) corresponds\nalso to the expression for the curvaton potential V (\u03c3). The no appearance of quartic or higher order terms in the potential is essential for the success of the model\nbecause, otherwise, the density ratio \u03c1\u03c3 /\u03c1r would not increase with time [47].\nMaking use of the curvature perturbation definition in Eq. (2.15), we can write\ndown the total \u03b6 in the curvaton scenario as:\n\u03b6 \u2261 \u2212\u03c8 \u2212 H\n\n\u03b4\u03c1\n\u03c1\u03070\n\n!\n\n,\n\n(2.54)\n\ntotal\n\nwhere the total energy density \u03c1total is simply the addition of the curvaton and radiation energy densities \u03c1\u03c3 and \u03c1r , that define the conserved curvaton and radiation\n8\n\nThe curvaton field must be weakly coupled to avoid premature thermalisation, which would\nerase all the information about the generatated curvature perturbation [47].\n\n31\n\n\fcurvature perturbations \u03b6\u03c3 and \u03b6r 9 :\n\u03b4\u03c1\u03c3\n1 \u03b4\u03c1\u03c3\n= \u2212\u03c8 +\n,\n\u03c1\u0307\u03c30\n3 \u03c1\u03c30\n1 \u03b4\u03c1r\n\u03b4\u03c1r\n= \u2212\u03c8 +\n.\n\u2261 \u2212\u03c8 \u2212 H\n\u03c1\u0307r0\n4 \u03c1r0\n\n\u03b6\u03c3 \u2261 \u2212\u03c8 \u2212 H\n\n(2.55)\n\n\u03b6r\n\n(2.56)\n\nIn the above expressions we have employed the background continuity equation\n[71, 101, 112]\n\u03c1\u03070 + 3H(\u03c10 + P0 ) = 0 ,\n(2.57)\nwhere P0 = 0 for a matter fluid, and P0 = \u03c10 /3 for a radiation fluid.

(2.54), (2.55), and (2.56), the total curvature perturbation \u03b6 can then be\nwritten down as the weighted sum\n\u03b6 = (1 \u2212 r)\u03b6r + r\u03b6\u03c3 ,\nwith modulation factor\nr\u2261\n\n3\u03c1\u03c30\n.\n4\u03c1r0 + 3\u03c1\u03c30\n\n(2.58)\n(2.59)\n\nNotice that just at the beginning of the radiation dominated epoch that follows\nthe reheating stage produced by the inflaton decay, r is almost zero since \u03c1\u03c3 is\nnegligible by that time; therefore \u03b6 \u2248 \u03b6r which is negligible. However, r grows\nin time due to the relative redshifting between \u03c1\u03c3 and \u03c1r until when eventually \u03c3\ndecays. In view of Eqs. (2.58) and (2.59), the total \u03b6 grows then in time approaching\nmore and more to the curvaton curvature perturbation \u03b6\u03c3 . One extreme example\nis when \u03c3 has dominated the energy density before decaying; in that case r \u2248 1\nand therefore \u03b6 \u2248 \u03b6\u03c3 . When \u03c3 decays, \u03b6 is imprinted in remaining radiation fluid\nstarting this way the gravitational instability process that ends up with the presently\nobserved large-scale structure.\nAs we have already pointed out, one of the requirements of the curvaton scenario\nis that the curvature perturbation produced by the inflaton during inflation \u03b6r is\ncompletely negligible compared with that produced by the curvaton \u03b6\u03c3 during the\nsame period: \u03b6r \u226a \u03b6\u03c3 . Under that assumption, the expression for the total \u03b6 after\n\u03c3 decays comes from Eq. (2.58) as\n\u03b6 \u2248 r\u03b6\u03c3 ,\n\n(2.60)\n\nin the sudden decay approximation [139]. For a model that goes beyond this approximation the expression for the total \u03b6 in terms of \u03b6\u03c3 is only obtained by means\nof numerical calculations, the result being in that case [138, 146]\n\n9\n\n\u03b6 \u2248 \u03a9dec \u03b6\u03c3 ,\n\n(2.61)\n\nThe curvature perturbations \u03b6\u03c3 and \u03b6r , associated to the curvaton and the radiation fluids\nrespectively, are conserved since the adiabatic condition is satisfied separately being both fluids\nnon-interacting.\n\n32\n\n\fwhere \u03a9dec is the fractional global curvaton energy density just before the curvaton\ndecay:\n!\n\u03c1\u03c30\n\u03a9dec =\n.\n(2.62)\n\u03c1total0 dec\nAs we mentioned in Chapter 1, and will explain in Chapter 5, the normalisation fNL\nof the bispectrum B\u03b6 (k1 , k2 , k3 ) of \u03b6 in the curvaton scenario is directly related to\n\u03a9dec if the latter is not so close to 1 [14, 17, 131, 138]:\nfNL \u2248 \u2212\n\n5\n.\n4\u03a9dec\n\n(2.63)\n\nThe parameter fNL gives information about the level of non-gaussianity present in\n< 102 . This\n\u03b6, and the actual bound on it, coming from WMAP data [102], is |fNL | \u223c\nbound translates into a lower bound for \u03a9dec , that combined with the obvious energy\ndensity condition \u03a9dec \u2264 1, gives the allowed range\n< \u03a9dec \u2264 1 .\n0.01 \u223c\n\n(2.64)\n\nThe present lower bound on \u03a9dec is likely to be increased [103] by the next WMAP\ndata release or the future PLANCK satellite data if non-gaussianity effects are not\ndetected.\nOnce we have studied how the curvature perturbation is produced in the curvaton\nscenario, we proceed now to study the spectrum P\u03b6 (k) of \u03b6. In view of Eq. (2.53),\nand having in mind that the equation of motion for \u03b4\u03c3a is the same as that for the\nbackground field \u03c3a0 , throughout inflation and during the post-inflationary period,\nas long as the non-gauge invariant curvature perturbation \u03c8 is fixed to be zero10 , we\ncan relate the contrast in the energy density of \u03c3 at any time t with the contrast in\n\u03c3 some time after horizon exit but before the onset of the curvaton oscillations:\n\u03b4\u03c1\u03c3\n\u03b4\u03c3a\n\u22482\n\u03c1\u03c30\n\u03c3a0\n\n!\n\n\u22432\n\n\u03b4\u03c3\n.\n\u03c3\u2217\n\n(2.65)\n\nFrom Eqs. (2.55), (2.61), and (2.65), \u03b6 is expressed in terms of the perturbations in\n\u03c3 a few Hubble times after horizon exit:\n\u03b4\u03c3\n2\n\u03b6 \u2248 \u03a9dec ,\n3\n\u03c3\u2217\n\n(2.66)\n\nand in consequence the spectrum P\u03b6 (k) is given by\n4\nP\u03b4\u03c3 (k)\nP\u03b6 (k) \u2248 \u03a92dec\n.\n9\n\u03c3\u22172\n10\n\n(2.67)\n\nThat is indeed the case while the curvature perturbation \u03b6r in the radiation fluid is taken to\nbe negligible [204], which is one of the key assumptions in the curvaton scenario.\n\n33\n\n\fThe curvaton field \u03c3 is a light field whose energy density is negligible during inflation;\ntherefore the discussion and results of Subsection 2.4.1 apply [c.f. Eqs. (2.51) and\n(2.52)], giving as a result\nP\u03b6 (k) \u2261\n\nA2\u03b6\n\nk\naHinf\n\n! n\u03b6\n\nH\u2217 \u03a9dec\n\u2243\n3\u03c0\u03c3\u2217\n\u0014\n\n\u00152\n\nk\naHinf\n\n!2\u03b7\u03c3 \u22122\u03b5\n\n.\n\n(2.68)\n\nThe spectral index n\u03b6 is in good agreement with observation, which requires an\nalmost-scale invariant power spectrum [207]:\n\u2212 0.048 < n\u03b6 < 0.016 .\n\n(2.69)\n\nUnfortunately the Hubble parameter a few Hubble times after horizon exit H\u2217 ,\nwhich gives information about the inflationary energy scale, is not predicted by the\namplitude of P\u03b6 (k) since \u03c3\u2217 is an unknown and unbounded parameter. Nevertheless,\na lower bound for H\u2217 will be found in Chapter 3 by taking into consideration other\neffects that give a different relation between H\u2217 and \u03c3\u2217 , and the amplitude A\u03b6 in\nEq. (2.68) once the WMAP normalisation (|A\u03b6 | \u2248 5 \u00d7 10\u22125 ) [207] is taken into\naccount:\n\u03c3\u2217 \u2248 (1.5\u03c0 \u00d7 10\u22124 )\u22121 \u03a9dec H\u2217 .\n(2.70)\nWhat is important however to emphasise at this point is that the biggest possible\nvalue for H\u2217 in the curvaton scenario is for sure 1012 GeV. Otherwise the curvature\nperturbation \u03b6r , produced by the inflaton field during inflation, would contribute\nsignificantly to the total \u03b6, spoiling the main motivation for the proposal of the\ncurvaton scenario11 . The justification of this assertion will be given in the following\nsection.\n\n2.5\n\nThe inflaton scenario\n\nIn this section we will discuss the main facts about the inflaton scenario where\ninflation is assumed to be of the slow-roll variety [5, 112, 117, 130]. Slow-roll inflation\ncorresponds to the case where the inflaton field \u03c6 slowly-roll down towards the\nminimum of its potential. We will specify the slow-roll conditions and see what\ntheir consequences are on the shape of the inflaton potential as well as on the value\nand structural form of the slow-roll parameters \u03b5 and \u03b7\u03c6 . Being \u03c6 in the inflaton\nscenario the responsible of driving inflation and also of generating the curvature\nperturbation \u03b6, the power spectrum P\u03b6 (k) of \u03b6 presents definite signatures that are\nexpressed in terms of \u03b5 and \u03b7\u03c6 . We will calculate P\u03b6 (k) and see what the constraints\non the inflaton potential are in order to produce enough primordial perturbations.\nThe Hubble parameter during inflation H\u2217 will turn out to be likely quite high\n11\n\nThe only way to have H\u2217 > 1012 GeV in the curvaton scenario while making \u03b6r negligible is\nby requiring the inflaton field not to be light during inflation (m\u03c6 \u2265 H\u2217 ) [170]. A non slow-roll\ninflationary model is in that case compulsory.\n\n34\n\n\f< 1014 GeV) for the inflaton scenario to be consistent with the amplitude of\n(H\u2217 \u223c\nperturbations observed by WMAP. The scale of inflation is, therefore, likely high\nenough to impose severe constraints on concrete inflation models [167].\n\n2.5.1\n\nThe slow-roll conditions\n\nWe begin by considering the Friedmann and continuity equations, derived from the\nbackground Einstein equations for the FRW cosmological model [71, 101, 112], that\nrelate the Hubble parameter at any time with the global energy density and pressure\nof the fluid that fills the Universe:\n\u03c10\nH2 =\n,\n(2.71)\n3m2P\n\u03c1\u03070 = \u22123H(\u03c10 + P0 ) .\n(2.72)\nA direct consequence of both equations is that the second derivative of the global\nexpansion parameter a with respect to the cosmic time is given by a simple relation\ninvolving \u03c10 and P0 :\n\u00e4\n\u03c10 + 3P0\n.\n(2.73)\n=\u2212\na\n6m2P\nThis expression tells us that, to satisfy the inflationary condition \u00e4 > 0, the pressure\nof the fluid that fills the Universe must be negative satisfying\n\u03c10 + 3P0 < 0 .\n\n(2.74)\n\nAs an application of the above formula we may study the dynamics of the inflaton\nfield \u03c6 knowing that, from the energy momentum tensor for a homogeneous scalar\nfield [112], the unperturbed energy density and pressure of \u03c6 are given by\n1 2\n\u03c6\u0307 + V (\u03c60 ) ,\n2 0\n1 2\n\u03c6\u0307 \u2212 V (\u03c60 ) .\n=\n2 0\n\n\u03c1\u03c60 =\n\n(2.75)\n\nP \u03c60\n\n(2.76)\n\nThe inflationary condition in Eq. (2.74) is then satisfied provided that\n\u03c6\u030720 < V (\u03c60 ) .\n\n(2.77)\n\nThe most popular type of inflationary models assume that the kinetic energy\ndensity of the inflaton field is much less than the potential energy density:\n1 2\n\u03c6\u0307 \u226a V (\u03c60 ) ,\n(2.78)\n2 0\nwhich corresponds intuitively to a very flat potential along which the inflaton field\n\u03c6 slowly-roll down during inflation towards the minimum of its potential [112, 130].\nIf the expression in Eq. (2.78) is supplemented by the condition\n|\u03c6\u03080 | \u226a |3Hinf \u03c6\u03070 | ,\n35\n\n(2.79)\n\n\fthe inflaton field \u03c6 satisfies what is known as the slow-roll conditions [111]. As we\nwill see, these conditions can be expressed in terms of the parameters \u03b5 and \u03b7\u03c6 that\nparameterise the spectral index and amplitude of P\u03b6 (k) in the inflaton scenario.\nNotice that, under the slow-roll conditions, the background field \u03c60 follows the\nslow-roll equation of motion\n3Hinf \u03c6 \u03070 \u2248 \u2212\n\n\u2202V\n,\n\u2202\u03c60\n\n(2.80)\n\nwhich corresponds to the background Klein-Gordon equation under the condition\ngiven by Eq. (2.79).\nAs discussed in Subsection 2.3.1, the requirement to have a period of accelerated\nexpansion is easily expressed as an upper bound on the slow-roll parameter \u03b5 that\ndescribes the rate of change of the Hubble parameter a few Hubble times after\nhorizon exit:\n!\n\u1e22inf\n< 1.\n(2.81)\n\u03b5\u2261\u2212\n2\nHinf\n\u2217\nThe true reason why \u03b5 is called a slow-roll parameter is because it is constrained\nto be much less than 1 under the slow-roll conditions in Eqs. (2.78) and (2.79),\nbeing easily expressed in terms of the unperturbed inflaton potential V (\u03c60 ) and its\nderivative with respect to \u03c6 [111]:\nm2\n\u03b5 \u2248 P2\n2V\n\n\u2202V\n\u2202\u03c60\n\n!2\n\n\u226a 1.\n\n(2.82)\n\nThe flatness condition on the potential V (\u03c6) required for \u03c6 to slowly-roll during\ninflation is evident from the above expression.\nTwo slow-roll conditions (Eqs. (2.78) and (2.79)) require constraints on two\nslow-roll parameters. One of them is that given in Eq. (2.82) in terms of \u03b5; the\nother one is given in terms of the parameter \u03b7\u03c6 already defined in Eq. (1.9):\n\u03b7\u03c6 \u2261 \u03b5 \u2212\n\n\u03c6\u03080\n.\nHinf \u03c6\u03070\n\n(2.83)\n\nThe respective constraint on \u03b7\u03c6 and its relation with V (\u03c6) are obtained once we\ntake into consideration the slow-roll conditions in Eqs. (2.78) and (2.79) [111]:\n|\u03b7\u03c6 | \u2248\n\nm2P \u2202 2 V\n\u226a 1.\nV \u2202\u03c620\n\n(2.84)\n\nThis relation again shows how flat the potential of the inflaton field ought to be to\ndrive inflation. This is particularly good in order to generate enough inflation as\n\u03c6 spends a lot of time rolling along the flat part of its potential, which is in turn\nperhaps the main motivation to have an inflationary slow-roll model.\n36\n\n\fFrom the practical point of view, inflation is said to start when V (\u03c6) satisfies\nboth Eqs. (2.82) and (2.84), and ends when any of them is violated. Let's however\nremember that, in any case, the slow-roll conditions are sufficient but not necessary\nto drive inflation. Strictly speaking inflation may end some time after the slow-roll\nconditions are violated, but this time is very small compared with the 70 e-folds or\nso of inflation required to solve the horizon, flatness, and unwanted relics problems,\nunder standard evolution.\n\n2.5.2\n\nSpectrum of perturbations of a dominating light scalar\nfield during a quasi de Sitter stage\n\nWhen we consider a scalar field \u03c6 that dominates the energy density during inflation\nand whose perturbations are sizable enough, the spacetime stops being perfectly\nsmooth so that we have to leave the comfortable unperturbed metric line element\nin Eq. (2.2) to adopt the perturbed line element described in Eq. (2.3). As a result\nthe Klein-Gordon equation for the Fourier modes \u03c9k of the perturbations in \u03c6 is\nmodified to take into account the backreaction of the metric [96, 162, 163, 185]:\nk2 \u2202 2 V\n\u03c9\u0308k + 3Hinf \u03c9\u0307k +\n+\na2\n\u2202\u03c620\n\n!\n\n\u03c9k = \u22122\u03c6Gk\n\n\u2202V\n+ \u03c6\u0307Gk \u03c6\u03070 + 3\u03c8\u0307k \u03c6\u03070 \u2212 k 2 Bk \u03c6\u03070 . (2.85)\n\u2202\u03c60\n\nThe above equation looks quite difficult to manage but, fortunately, we can eliminate\nsome of the scalar degrees of freedom by fixing the gauge and using the perturbed\nEinstein equations for the inflaton field \u03c6 [96, 162, 163, 185]. For instance, going to\nthe longitudinal gauge, we can fix the scalar perturbations B and E to be zero in the\nmetric line element of Eq. (2.3), whereas the non-diagonal part of the ij component\nof the perturbed Einstein equations requires \u03c6G = \u03c8 being the stress associated to\n\u03c60 completely isotropic. The modified Klein-Gordon equation reduces in this case\nto\n!\nk2 \u2202 2 V\n\u2202V\n\u03c9\u0308k + 3Hinf \u03c9\u0307k +\n+ 4\u03c8\u0307k \u03c6\u03070 .\n(2.86)\n+\n\u03c9\n=\n\u22122\u03c8\nk\nk\n2\na2\n\u2202\u03c60\n\u2202\u03c60\nTo solve the previous equation we still require to know the behaviour of \u03c8.

That imposes the following constraint on the Hubble parameter during inflation H\u2217 in terms of \u03b5:\n\u221a\nH\u2217 \u2248 1015 \u03b5 GeV ,\n(2.104)\n< 0.01 coming from spectral index and\nthat combined with the present bound \u03b5 \u223c\n< 1014 GeV [123]. Despite the fact\ngravitational waves constraints [207] requires H\u2217 \u223c\nthat the inflationary energy scale, directly related to the value of H\u2217 , is in the inflaton\nscenario regulated by the parameter \u03b5, low-scale inflation may well be obtained but\nonly at the expense of a very small \u03b5, which in turn requires a high level of finetuning [167] (see however Ref. [177]). As a consequence serious problems appear\nwhen trying to build successful particle physics inflationary models [112, 130]. The\nrelevance of finding such a kind of low-scale inflation models is evident since the\ninflaton field could be identified with one of the MSSM flat directions or one of the\nscalar fields in the SUSY breaking sector (see for example Refs. [27, 52, 64, 93, 125,\n126]).\nGoing back to the curvaton scenario, we said that one of the assumptions of\nthe model was a negligible curvature perturbation generated by the inflaton. This\nassumption may be quantified by requiring \u03b6r to be, say, at most 1% of the total \u03b6,\nwhich means, from Eq. (2.103), that H\u2217 in the curvaton scenario must satisfy\n\u221a\n< 1013 \u03b5 GeV < 1012 GeV .\nH\u2217 \u223c\n(2.105)\n\u223c\nIn the following section we will show how such an upper bound on H\u2217 makes the\ndetection of gravitational waves an anti-smoking gun for the curvaton scenario.\n\n2.6\n\nGravitational waves\n\nPrimordial tensor-type perturbations in spacetime are regarded as gravitational\nwaves, being unsourced during inflation and susceptible to be decomposed in a\npolarisation tensor basis. They also propagate in a way that each subhorizon mode\nfunction follows a harmonic wave equation of motion, i.e. the Klein-Gordon equation\nassociated to a massless scalar field in Minkowski spacetime.\nThe relevant quantity to discuss now is \u03a0Tij , which is the tensor component of the\nfull perturbed metric tensor, and that, as shown in Subsection 2.2.1, is characterized\nby two degrees of freedom in our three dimensional space as well as by satisfying\nthe transversality condition \u2202i \u03a0Tij = 0. Hereafter we will write \u03a0Tij as 2hij as it is\ndone in most of the literature. Displaying only the tensor perturbation, the metric\nline element in conformal time reads then\nds2 = a2 (\u03b7)[\u2212d\u03b7 2 + (\u03b4ij + 2hij (\u03b7, x))dxi dxj ] .\n\n(2.106)\n\nTensor perturbations are decoupled from their scalar and vector counterparts. The\nline element in Eq. (2.106) shows then that hij is a gauge invariant quantity.\n40\n\n\fThe Einstein-Hilbert action involving hij , and given in a general way by\nSE \u2261 \u2212\n\nm2P\n2\n\nZ\n\nd4 x(\u2212g)1/2 R ,\n\n(2.107)\n\nbeing g the determinant of the g\u03bc\u03bd metric tensor and R the Ricci scalar, is given as\na function of the kinetic term associated to hij as obtained from Eq. (2.106):\nSE = \u2212\n\nm2P Z 4\n1\nd x(\u2212g)1/2 \u2202\u03bc hij \u2202 \u03bc hij .\n2\n2\n\n(2.108)\n\nNotice that no more terms have been added to Eqs. (2.107) and (2.108) because no\ntensor-type contributions to the energy-momentum tensor exist during the inflationary period. The primordial tensor perturbations hij are in consequence unsourced\nso that they propagate freely throughout space following a harmonic (on subhorizon\nscales) wave propagation pattern.\nTo clearly show how the hij perturbations propagate, we apply to them the same\nkind of treatment we do to the scalar perturbations in previous sections. We begin\nby decomposing hij in canonically normalised Fourier modes hpk :\n\u221a Z\nX\n2\nd3 k\nhij (\u03b7, x) =\nexp(ik\n*\nx)\n\u03b5ij (p, k)hpk (\u03b7) + h.c. ,\n(2.109)\n3/2\nmP\n(2\u03c0)\np\nwhere p = +, \u00d7 are the two degrees of freedom (polarisation states), and the factors\n\u03b5ij (p, k) are the polarisation tensors that satisfy\nX\n\nki \u03b5ij (p, k) = 0 ,\n\n(2.110)\n\ni\n\nX\n\n\u03b5\u2217ij (p, k)\u03b5ij (p\u2032 , k) = 2\u03b4pp\u2032 ,\n\n(2.111)\n\nij\n\nX\nijl\n\nX\nijl\n\n\u03b5ilk \u03b5\u2217ij (+, k)\u03b5jl(\u00d7, k) = \u2212\n\u03b5ilk \u03b5\u2217ij (+, k)\u03b5jl (+, k) = \u2212\n\nX\n\n\u03b5ilk \u03b5\u2217ij (\u00d7, k)\u03b5jl (+, k) = 2\n\nijl\n\nX\n\nkk\n,\n|k|\n\n\u03b5ilk \u03b5\u2217ij (\u00d7, k)\u03b5jl (\u00d7, k) = 0 ,\n\n(2.112)\n(2.113)\n\nijl\n\naccording to the transversality condition and the properties of the rotational transformations [129, 134]12 .

Unfortunately, at the\nmoment all the efforts to detect gravity waves have been fruitless, leaving only the\n< 1014 GeV [207]. In addition, technological restrictions impose\nupper bound H\u2217 \u223c\n> 1012 GeV if gravity waves may some day be detected [85,\nthe lower bound H\u2217 \u223c\n94, 95, 201, 202, 205]. A positive detection would kill then the curvaton scenario\nbecause, as we had discussed in Subsection 2.5.3, the inflationary energy scale in\n< 1012 GeV to make the inflaton field \u03c6 not to\nthis scenario is required to satisfy H\u2217 \u223c\ngenerate enough curvature perturbation. Only in non-slow roll inflationary models\n[170] (specifically if \u03b7\u03c6 \u2261 m2\u03c6 /3H\u22172 > 1), the energy scale during inflation could\nbe high enough to allow the detection of gravity waves consistent with a negligible\ncontribution of \u03c6 to \u03b6.\nWe end up this section by reporting the existence of a consistency relation between the curvature perturbation spectrum P\u03b6 (k) and the gravitational waves one\nPT (k) in the inflaton scenario [2, 68, 112, 190]. The ratio between the amplitudes\nof both spectra [c.f. Eqs. (2.103) and (2.126)] is given by the slow-roll parameter \u03b5:\nrT \u03b6 \u2261\n\nA2T\n= 16\u03b5 ,\nA2\u03b6\n43\n\n(2.127)\n\n\fwhich in turn gives information about the spectral index of PT (k) :\nnT = \u22122\u03b5 .\n\n(2.128)\n\nThe ratio rT \u03b6 is then consistently related to the spectral index nT , this relation being\ngiven by the expression\nrT \u03b6 = \u22128nT .\n(2.129)\nNo consistency relation of this type is encountered in the curvaton scenario or in\nother scenarios for the origin of the large-scale structure in the Universe, although\nit is true that rT \u03b6 is always smaller in the multi-component inflationary case [130],\nso that its future confirmation would mean good news for the inflaton scenario.\nNevertheless, if the consistency relation turns out to be experimentally wrong, that\ndoes not mean necessarily that the inflationary paradigm is wrong, just that the\nsingle-field variant is not nature's choosing. Anyway, the non-gaussianity signatures\nassociated to each model would add up to the consistency relation in Eq. (2.129), to\nact as powerful discriminators for models that give origin to the primordial energy\ndensity perturbations (see Chapters 5 and 6).\n\n2.7\n\nConclusions\n\nThe curvature perturbation \u03b6 is a well defined quantity, gauge-invariant and conserved on large scales (if the adiabatic condition is satisfied), that allows us to\nquantify the primordial energy density inhomogeneities produced during inflation.\nThe statistical properties of \u03b6 are given by the spectrum P\u03b6 (k) whose amplitude and\nspectral index strongly depend on the specific mechanism of production of density\ninhomogeneities. This makes P\u03b6 (k) act as a discriminator for the different production mechanisms, at least as the spectral index n\u03b6 and the possible relation of A\u03b6\nwith the gravitational waves spectrum PT (k) are concerned [112, 130]. The inflationary energy scale, given by H\u2217 , is well determined by the amplitude of PT (k)\nso that the current upper bound on AT leads to H\u2217 <\n1014 GeV [207]. The en\u223c\nergy scale may be well below 1014 GeV, but only at the expense of a high level of\nfine tuning to make the slow-roll parameter \u03b5 be extremely below 1. This reflects\nhow constrained is the inflaton potential in the inflaton scenario, in order to produce enough curvature perturbation while driving inflation. As a result the particle\nphysics motivated inflationary models are quite unrealistic if we insist that the inflaton field \u03c6 has to produce the energy density inhomogeneities [167]. It is here where\nthe curvaton scenario comes to the rescue: by requiring \u03c6 just to drive inflation,\nthe weakly coupled curvaton field \u03c3 is in charge of giving origin to \u03b6 [138, 139, 159].\nThe inflationary energy scale is in this case easily lowered so as to possibly associate\n\u03c6 with one of the fields appearing in supersymmetric extensions of the Standard\nModel of particle physics. Gravitational waves are in this case so tiny to ever be\ndetected, since the current detection technology restricts H\u2217 to be above 1012 GeV\n[85, 94, 95, 201, 202, 205]. Which scenario for the generation of \u03b6 is correct will\n44\n\n\fbe determined by future observations. At the moment, we will just try to do our\nbest to successfully integrate cosmology and particle physics, being the first step\nthe determination of the lower bound for H\u2217 in the simplest curvaton model [126].\nAs we will see in the next chapter, H\u2217 in such a model is still quite high, being\nH\u2217 > 107 GeV, so that a modification to the basic setup is urgently needed. Two\nmodifications to the simplest curvaton model will be explored in Chapters 3 and 4\n[51, 189], showing that low scale inflation with H\u2217 \u223c 1 TeV or lower is possible to\nbe obtained.\n\n45\n\n\fChapter 3\nLow scale inflation and the\ncurvaton mechanism\n3.1\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe primordial curvature perturbation \u03b6 is generated presumably from the perturbation of some scalar field, which in turn is generated from the vacuum fluctuation\nduring inflation. The scalar field responsible for the primordial curvature perturbation is traditionally supposed to be the inflaton field \u03c6, i.e. the field responsible for\nthe dynamics and, in particular, the end of inflation [112]. This 'inflaton hypothesis'\nis economical, but it is quite difficult to implement and, if many scalar fields exist,\nit presumably is not particularly likely. An alternative is that the curvature perturbation is generated by the weakly coupled curvaton field \u03c3, which could dominate\n(though not necessarily) the energy density before it decays [138, 139, 159] (see also\nRefs. [66, 116, 156]). According to this 'curvaton hypothesis', the contribution of\nthe inflaton to the curvature perturbation is negligible. This is especially true if\nthe energy scale of inflation is much lower than the scale of grand unification, the\nlatter scale being the typical requirement of the traditional inflaton hypothesis1 . In\nfact, one of the advantages of the curvaton scenario is the relaxation of the constraints on the inflationary energy scale, which alleviates many tuning problems in\ninflation model\u2013building and allows for the construction of realistic, theoretically\nwell-motivated inflation models [49, 160, 161].\nIn the simplest version of the curvaton model though, the scale of inflation is\nstill required to be quite high corresponding to Hubble parameter H\u2217 > 107 GeV\n[126]. The purpose of this chapter is to systematically explore a modification of the\ncurvaton model which can instead allow inflation at an even lower scale [51]2 . To\nbe specific, we aim for H\u2217 \u223c 103 GeV, which holds if the inflationary potential is\n1\n\nAlthough some exceptions exist (see for example Ref. [177]).\nLow scale inflation has also been studied [174] in the context of the 'inhomogeneous reheating\nscenario' [53, 54, 97] (see also Refs. [65, 148, 150, 151, 216, 224]), where the inhomogeneities in\nthe inflaton decay rate during inflation give origin to \u03b6.\n2\n\n46\n\n\fgenerated by some mechanism of gravity-mediated supersymmetry breaking which\nholds also in the vacuum.\nWe begin by presenting some known bounds in a unified notation. Then we\nconsider the possibility that the curvaton mass increases suddenly at some moment\nafter the end of inflation but before the onset of the curvaton oscillations [51].\n\n3.2\n\nThe bounds on the scale of inflation\n\nIn this section we present four bounds on the scale of inflation, in terms of three\nparameters which encode possible modifications of the simplest curvaton scenario.\nThese bounds have been presented at least implicitly in earlier works [126, 149, 175]\nbut not in the unified notation that we employ. The advantage of this notation is\nthat it will allow us to compare the bounds in various situations, establishing with\nease which is the most crucial. The three parameters are\n\u2022 The ratio \u01eb \u2261 \u03c3\u2217 /\u03c3osc , where \u03c3\u2217 is the global value of the curvaton field at\nhorizon exit and \u03c3osc is its global value when it starts to oscillate.\n\u2022 The ratio f \u2261 Hosc /m\u0303\u03c3 , where Hosc is the Hubble parameter at the start of\nthe oscillations and m\u0303\u03c3 is the effective curvaton mass after the onset of the\noscillations.\nq\n\n\u2022 The ratio \u03b4 \u2261 Hosc /H\u2217 where H\u2217 is the Hubble parameter a few Hubble\ntimes after horizon exit.\n\n3.2.1\n\nCurvaton physics considerations\n\nThe observed value of the nearly scale invariant spectrum of curvature perturbations,\nparameterised by the amplitude A\u03b6 , is |A\u03b6 | \u2248 5\u00d710\u22125 [207]. In the curvaton scenario\n\u03b6 is given by [138, 139, 159] [c.f. Eq. (2.62)]\n\u03b6 \u2248 \u03a9dec \u03b6\u03c3 ,\n\n(3.1)\n\nwhere \u03a9dec \u2264 1 is the density fraction of the global curvaton energy density \u03c1\u03c30 over\nthe global total energy density of the Universe \u03c1total0 at the time of the decay of the\ncurvaton:\n!\n\u03c1\u03c30\n,\n(3.2)\n\u03a9dec \u2261\n\u03c1total0 dec\nand \u03b6\u03c3 is the curvature perturbation of the curvaton field \u03c3, which is [47] [c.f.\nEq. (2.55)]\n!\n!\n\u03b4\u03c3\n\u03b4\u03c3\n\u03b6\u03c3 \u223c\n\u2248\n,\n(3.3)\n\u03c3 dec\n\u03c3 osc\nwhere 'osc' denotes the time when the curvaton oscillations begin and 'dec' denotes\nthe time of curvaton decay.\n47\n\n\fIn all the cases which we consider,\n\u03b4\u03c3\n\u03c3\n\n!\n\n\u2217\n\n\u03b4\u03c3\n\u03c3\n\n\u2243\n\n!\n\n,\n\n(3.4)\n\nosc\n\nwhere '*' denotes the epoch when the cosmological scales exit the horizon during\ninflation. The above typically holds true because the curvaton (being a light field)\nis frozen during and after inflation until the onset of its oscillations. However, this\ndoes not mean that \u03c3\u2217 \u2243 \u03c3osc necessarily. Indeed, in the case of a pseudo NambuGoldstone boson (PNGB) curvaton with a varying order parameter v, the curvaton\nfield is associated with the angular displacement \u03b8 from the minimum of its potential\nas [50, 51]\n\u221a\n\u03c3 \u2261 2 v\u03b8 .\n(3.5)\n\nTherefore, even though after the end of inflation, \u03b8 remains approximately frozen\n(the angular motion is over damped), we may have \u01eb \u226a 1, where\n\u03c3\u2217\n,\n\u03c3osc\n\n\u01eb\u2261\n\n(3.6)\n\nbecause [cf. Eq. (3.5)] v\u2217 = \u01ebvosc \u226a vosc . However, in this case too, for the curvaton\nfractional perturbation we find\n\u03b4\u03c3\n\u03c3\n\n!\n\n=\n\u2217\n\n\u03b4\u03b8\n\u03b8\n\n!\n\n\u2217\n\n\u2243\n\n\u03b4\u03c3\n\u03c3\n\n!\n\n,\n\n(3.7)\n\nosc\n\nwhich agrees nicely with Eq. (3.4).\nNow, for the perturbation of the curvaton we have the following value for the\namplitude A\u03b4\u03c3\u2217 of the spectrum of perturbations [c.f. Eq. (2.51)]\nA\u03b4\u03c3\u2217 \u2243\n\nH\u2217\n.\n2\u03c0\n\n(3.8)\n\nH\u2217\n,\n2\u03c0\u01eb\n\n(3.9)\n\nCombining Eqs. (3.6) and (3.8) we find\nA\u03b4\u03c3osc \u2243\n\nwhich means that, if the order parameter of a PNGB curvaton grows, the curvaton\nperturbation is amplified by a factor \u01eb\u22121 [51].\nFrom Eqs. (3.1) and (3.3) we have\n\u03c3osc \u223c \u03a9dec\n\n\u03b4\u03c3osc\nA\u03b4\u03c3osc\n= \u03a9dec\n.\n\u03b6\nA\u03b6\n\n(3.10)\n\nUsing Eq. (3.9), we can recast the above as\n\u03c3osc \u223c\n\nH\u2217 \u03a9dec\n.\n\u03c0\u01ebA\u03b6\n48\n\n(3.11)\n\n\f3.2.2\n\nThe main bound on the scale of inflation\n\nFor the density fraction at the onset of the curvaton oscillations we have:\n\u03c1\u03c30\n\u03c1total0\n\n!\n\nosc\n\n\u223cf\n\nwhere\nf\u2261\n\n\u22122\n\n\u0012\n\n\u03c3osc\nmP\n\n\u00132\n\nHosc\n,\nm\u0303\u03c3\n\n,\n\n(3.12)\n\n(3.13)\n\n2\n2\nand we used that (\u03c1\u03c30 )osc \u2243 12 m\u03032\u03c3 \u03c3osc\nand (\u03c1total0 )osc = 3Hosc\nm2P . Here, m\u0303\u03c3 denotes\nthe effective mass of the curvaton after the onset of its oscillations. In the basic\nsetup of the curvaton hypothesis this effective mass is the bare mass m\u03c3 . If this\nis the case then m\u0303\u03c3 = m\u03c3 \u2243 Hosc (i.e. f \u2243 1). However, in the heavy curvaton\nscenario, the mass of the curvaton is supposed to be suddenly incremented at some\ntime after the end of the inflationary epoch due to a coupling of the form \u03bb\u03c72 \u03c3 2 with\na field \u03c7 which acquires a large vacuum expectation value (VEV) at some time after\n2\nthe end of inflation [51, 126, 189]. In this case m\u03032\u03c3 = m2\u03c3 + \u03bbh\u03c7i2 \u2248 \u03bbh\u03c7i2 \u226b Hosc\n(i.e. f \u226a 1).\nNow, we need to consider separately the cases when the curvaton decays before\nit dominates the Universe (\u03a9dec \u226a 1) or after it does so (\u03a9dec \u223c 1). Note, that the\nWMAP constraints on non-gaussianity in the CMB [102] impose a lower bound on\n\u03a9dec , which allows the range [138] [c.f. Eqs. (2.63) and (2.64)]\n\n< \u03a9dec \u2264 1 .\n0.01 \u223c\n\n(3.14)\n\nBecause of the above bound we might require that the density ratio \u03c1\u03c3 /\u03c1total grows\nsubstantially after the end of inflation. Typically, in the curvaton scenario this does\nindeed take place after the curvaton begins oscillating, but only if the curvaton\noscillates in a quadratic potential during the radiation era. As it was shown in\nRef. [47], if the curvaton oscillates in a quartic or even higher order potential, its\ndensity ratio does not increase with time (it may well decrease instead) and satisfying\nthe bound in Eq. (3.14) might be very hard. Due to this fact, in the following, we\nassume that the period of oscillations occurs in the radiation era with a quadratic\npotential. Hence, we consider that Hosc \u2264 \u0393inf , being \u0393inf the inflaton decay rate.\nSuppose, at first, that the curvaton decays before dominating the density of the\nUniverse so that \u03a9dec \u226a 1. Assuming that the curvaton oscillates in a quadratic potential, during the radiation epoch, its density fraction grows as \u03c1\u03c30 /\u03c1total0 \u221d H \u22121/2 .\nTherefore, at curvaton decay we have\n\u03a9dec \u223c\n\n2\nm\u03032\u03c3 \u03c3osc\n3/2\n\n3/2\n\nTdec Hosc mP\n\n,\n\n(3.15)\n\n4\nwhere we used Eq. (3.12) and also that (\u03c1total0 )dec \u223c Tdec\n, with Tdec being the radiation temperature just after the curvaton decay. Using Eq. (3.11) the above can be\n\n49\n\n\frecast as\nmP\nH\u2217 \u223c \u03c0\u01ebA\u03b6 f \u221a\n\u03a9dec\n\n\u0012\n\nHdec\nHosc\n\n\u00131/4\n\n,\n\n(3.16)\n\n2\nwhere we used that Tdec\n\u223c Hdec mP .\nNow, suppose that the curvaton decays after it dominates the Universe so that\n\u03a9dec \u223c 1. Since (\u03c1\u03c3 /\u03c1total )dom \u2243 1 by definition, using again that, during the radiation epoch, \u03c1\u03c30 /\u03c1total0 \u221d H \u22121/2 and in view of Eq. (3.12), we obtain\n\n\u0012\n\nHdom \u223c Hosc f \u22124\n\n\u03c3osc\nmP\n\n\u00134\n\n,\n\n(3.17)\n\nwhere 'dom' denotes the time of curvaton domination3 . Employing again Eq.

(3.14) we have \u03a9dec \u2264 1. Also, we require that the curvaton decays before BBN, i.e. Hdec > HBBN . Hence, the above provides the following\nbounds\n2\nH\u2217 > (\u03c0\u01ebA\u03b6 f )4/5 (TBBN\nm3P )1/5 \u223c (\u01ebf )4/5 \u00d7 107 GeV,\n1/4\nV\u2217\n\n> (\u03c0\u01ebA\u03b6 f )\n\n2/5\n\n(TBBN m4P )1/5\n\n3\n\n\u223c (\u01ebf )\n\n2/5\n\n\u00d7 10\n\n12\n\n(3.22)\n\nGeV.\n\nHere we define Hdom by Hdom = Heq , where Heq is the Hubble parameter at the time when\nthe global curvaton energy density \u03c1\u03c30 makes equal to the global radiation energy density \u03c1r0 .\n\n50\n\n\fIn the standard setup of the curvaton scenario \u01eb = f = 1 and the above bounds do\nnot allow inflation at low energy scales to take place [126]. However, we see that if\neither \u01eb or f are much smaller than unity the lower bound on the inflationary scale\ncan be substantially relaxed and low scale inflation can be accommodated4 . Still,\nthough, there are more bounds to be considered.\n\n3.2.3\n\nOther bounds related to curvaton decay\n\nFirstly, let us consider the bound coming from the fact that the decay rate of the\ncurvaton field cannot be arbitrarily small. Indeed, in view of the fact that the\ncurvaton interactions are at least of gravitational strength, we find the following\ndecay rate for the curvaton\nm\u03033\n\u0393\u03c3 \u2248 \u03b3\u03c3 2\u03c3 \u2264 m\u0303\u03c3 ,\n(3.23)\nmP\n> 1.\nwhere \u03b3\u03c3 \u223c\nSuppose, at first, that the curvaton decays after the onset of its oscillations, as\nin the basic setup of the curvaton scenario. In this case, \u0393\u03c3 \u2264 Hosc and Hdec = \u0393\u03c3 .\nUsing the fact that max{Hdom , \u0393\u03c3 } \u2265 \u0393\u03c3 , Eq. (3.23) suggests\nm\u0303\u03c3\nmax{Hdom , Hdec }\n\u2265 \u03b3\u03c3 f \u22121\nHosc\nmP\n\u0012\n\n\u00132\n\n.\n\n(3.24)\n\n,\n\n(3.25)\n\nIncluding the above into Eq. (3.19) the latter becomes\nH\u2217 \u2265\n\n\u221a\n\nq\n\n\u03b3\u03c3 (\u03c0\u01ebA\u03b6 )2 f\n\nmP\n\u03a9dec\n\n\u0012\n\nHosc\nH\u2217\n\n\u0013\n\nwhich results in the bounds\n\u221a\n\u221a\nH\u2217 \u2265 (\u03c0\u01ebA\u03b6 )2 f \u03b4 2 mP \u223c \u01eb2 f \u03b4 2 \u00d7 1011 GeV,\n1/4\nV\u2217\n\n\u2265 \u03c0\u01ebA\u03b6 f\n\n1/4\n\n\u03b4 mP \u223c \u01ebf\n\nwhere we have defined\n\u03b4\u2261\n\ns\n\n1/4\n\nHosc\n,\nH\u2217\n\n\u03b4 \u00d7 10\n\n14\n\n(3.26)\n\nGeV,\n\n(3.27)\n\nwhich must be really small in order to reduce the bounds in Eq. (3.22) to satisfactory\nlevels. In the case of a PNGB curvaton we see that the bounds in Eq. (3.26) are\ndrastically reduced with \u01eb, compared with the bounds in Eq. (3.22).\n4\n\nThe relevance of a low \u01eb makes evident in Ref. [51] where the scenario of the curvaton as\na PNGB is studied. The specific explored model refers to a PNGB whose order parameter v is\nincreased after the cosmological scales exit the horizon during inflation, but before the onset of the\ncurvaton oscillations. That makes \u01eb very small.\n\n51\n\n\fNow, provided we demand that the curvaton field does not itself result in a\nperiod of inflation, we see that the curvaton cannot dominate the Universe before\nthe onset of its oscillations. This results into the constraint\n\u03c1\u03c30\n\u03c1total0\n\n!\n\nosc\n\n\u2264 1 \u21d4 m\u0303\u03c3 \u2264 \u03c0\u01ebA\u03b6 \u03b4 2\n\nmP\n\u03a9dec H\u2217\n\u21d4 f\u2265\n,\n\u03a9dec\n(\u03c0\u01ebA\u03b6 )mP\n\n(3.28)\n\nwhere we used Eqs. (3.11), (3.12), (3.13) and (3.27). Inserting the above into\nEq. (3.25) we obtain\nmP\nH\u2217 \u2265 \u03b3\u03c3 (\u03c0\u01ebA\u03b6 )3 \u03b4 4\n,\n(3.29)\n\u03a9dec\nwhich results in the bounds\nH\u2217 \u2265 (\u03c0\u01ebA\u03b6 )3 \u03b4 4 mP \u223c \u01eb3 \u03b4 4 \u00d7 107 GeV,\n1/4\nV\u2217\n\n\u2265 (\u03c0\u01ebA\u03b6 )\n\n3/2 2\n\n3/2 2\n\n\u03b4 mP \u223c \u01eb\n\n\u03b4 \u00d7 10\n\n12\n\n(3.30)\n\nGeV.\n\nA similar bound is reached with the use of the upper bound on m\u0303\u03c3\nm\u0303\u03c3 \u2264 \u03b3\u03c3\u22121/3 (Hosc m2P )1/3 ,\n\n(3.31)\n\nwhich comes from \u0393\u03c3 \u2264 Hosc and Eq. (3.23), instead of the bound in Eq. (3.28).\nInserting the above into Eq. (3.25) one finds [cf. Eq. (3.29)]\nH\u2217 \u2265 \u03b3\u03c3 (\u03c0\u01ebA\u03b6 )3 \u03b4 4\n\nmP\n3/2\n\n\u03a9dec\n\n,\n\n(3.32)\n\nwhich, again, results in the bound in Eq. (3.30), as it was suggested in Ref. [175].\nIn the heavy curvaton scenario we have \u01eb = 1 and also Hosc \u2243 min{Hpt , m\u0303\u03c3 },\nwhere Hpt corresponds to the phase transition which increases the effective mass\nof the curvaton. Then, if \u03b4 \u2192 1, the bounds in Eq. (3.30) are not possible to be\nrelaxed below the standard case discussed in Ref. [126] despite the fact that we may\nhave f \u226a 1 in Eqs. (3.22) and (3.26). Therefore, in the heavy curvaton scenario we\nrequire \u03b4 \u226a 1, i.e. the onset of the curvaton oscillations has to occur much later\nthan the end of inflation so that H\u2217 \u226b Hosc \u2265 \u0393\u03c3 [149]. In this case, as can be seen\nin Eq. (3.30), it is easy to lower the bound on the inflationary scale even for a notso-small value of \u03b4. This is a very nice feature of this scenario. Note also, that in the\ncase of a PNGB curvaton Hosc \u223c m\u03c3 \u226a H\u2217 and \u03b4 is very small necessarily. Because,\nin this case, \u01eb \u226a 1, it is straightforward to see that the bounds in Eq. (3.30) are\nmuch weaker than the bounds in Eq. (3.22).\nAs it was pointed out in Ref. [175], the sudden increment in the curvaton mass\nmight lead to a growth in the curvaton decay rate enough for \u0393\u03c3 > Hpt . This\nwould force the curvaton to decay immediately and we can write Hosc \u223c Hpt \u223c Hdec .\n52\n\n\fObviously, in this case we cannot have Hdec < Hdom and there is no period when\n\u03c1\u03c30 /\u03c1total0 \u221d H \u22121/2 . This means that (\u03c1\u03c30 /\u03c1total0 )osc \u223c \u03a9dec . Using Eqs. (3.11) and\n(3.12) it is easy to find\nmP\nH\u2217 \u223c \u03c0\u01ebA\u03b6 f \u221a\n,\n(3.33)\n\u03a9dec\nwhich results in the following bounds\n\nH\u2217 \u2265 \u03c0\u01ebA\u03b6 f mP \u223c \u01ebf \u00d7 1014 GeV,\n1/4\nV\u2217\n\n\u2265\n\nq\n\n\u03c0\u01ebA\u03b6 f mP \u223c (\u01ebf )\n\n1/2\n\n\u00d7 10\n\n16\n\n(3.34)\n\nGeV.\n\nIt is evident that the above bounds may challenge the WMAP constraint for the\ncurvaton scenario [49] leading to excessive curvature perturbations from the inflaton\nfield if \u03b5 and/or f are not much smaller than unity.\nThe bounds in Eqs. (3.22), (3.26), and (3.30) provide the basis for our investigation [51], leaving the fourth bound in Eq. (3.34) to be considered in the next chapter\n[189]. As a matter of completeness we have considered all the other possible bounds\ncoming from the requirements that \u0393\u03c3 < m\u0303\u03c3 and Hdec \u2265 HBBN . We have found that\nthese bounds lead to consistent and/or weaker constraints than the above four.\n\n3.3\n\nThe case of a heavy curvaton\n\nIn this section we are going to consider the so called 'heavy curvaton scenario'\nwhere an increment in the curvaton mass, at some moment after the end of inflation\nbut before the onset of the curvaton oscillations, leads to a huge decrease of the\ninflationary scale through the attainment of a very small parameter \u03b4 [cf. Eq. (3.30)].\nWe will do so by the implementation of a second inflationary period following the\nidea first presented in Ref. [149]5 . We identify this second inflationary period as\nthe thermal inflation one which triggers the increment in the curvaton mass when\nthe flaton field, that responsible for the generation of the thermal inflation era, rolls\ndown towards the minimum of the potential.\n\n3.3.1\n\nThe thermal inflation model\n\nThermal inflation was introduced as a very nice mechanism to get rid of some unwanted relics that the main inflationary epoch is not able to dilute, without affecting\nthe density perturbations generated during ordinary inflation. As its name suggests,\n5\n\nNote however that any post-inflationary phase transition could serve the purpose of giving an\neffective mass to the curvaton field.\n\n53\n\n\fthermal inflation relies on the finite-temperature effects on the flaton scalar potential. A flaton field \u03c7 could be defined as a field with mass m\u03c7 and vacuum expectation value M \u226b m\u03c7 [136, 137]. More specifically, a flaton field is a MSSM flat\ndirection lifted by non-renormalisable terms. SUSY breaking provides soft terms\nwhich create a large vacuum expectation value because the absence of quartic terms\nin the potential. The possible candidates for a flaton field within particle physics\nare either one of the many expected gauge singlets in string theory [172] or the GUT\nHiggs (which is a scalar field charged under the GUT gauge symmetry but neutral\nunder the Standard Model one) with m\u03c7 \u223c 103 GeV and M \u223c 1016 GeV [136]6 .\nAfter the period of reheating following the main inflationary epoch, the thermal\nbackground modifies the flaton potential V trapping the flaton field at the origin\nand preventing it to roll-down towards M [13, 108]. At this stage the total energy\ndensity \u03c1total and pressure Ptotal are\n\u03c1total = V + \u03c1r ,\n1\nPtotal = \u2212V + \u03c1r ,\n3\n\n(3.35)\n\nmaking the condition for thermal inflation, \u03c1total0 + 3Ptotal0 < 0, valid when the\nglobal thermal energy density \u03c1r0 falls below the height of the potential Vh , which\n1/4\ncorresponds to a temperature of roughly Vh . Thermal inflation ends when the\nfinite temperature becomes ineffective at confining the field, at a temperature of\norder m\u03c7 , so the number of e-folds this inflationary period lasts is\naend\nN = ln\nastart\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\nTstart\n= ln\nTend\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\n\uf8eb\n\n1/4\n\n\uf8f6\n\nV\n1\nM\n\u223c ln \uf8ed h \uf8f8 \u223c ln\nm\u03c7\n2\nm\u03c7\n\n!\n\n\u223c 10 .\n\n(3.36)\n\nHere we have used the fact that, in a flaton potential of the form\nV = Vh \u2212 (m2\u03c7 \u2212 gT 2 )|\u03c7|2 +\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nn=1\n\n2n+4\n\u03bbn m\u22122n\n,\nP |\u03c7|\n\n(3.37)\n\nwhere the nth term dominates:\nm\u03032\u03c7 = 2(n + 1)m2\u03c7 ,\nM\n\n2n+2\n\nmP\u22122n\n\n(3.38)\n\u22121\n\n= [2(n + 1)(n + 2)\u03bbn ]\n\nVh = [2(n + 2)]\u22121 m\u03032\u03c7 M 2 .\n\nm\u03032\u03c7\n\n,\n\n(3.39)\n(3.40)\n\nNote that the gT 2 contribution to the effective mass of the flaton field stands for\nthe effect of the thermal background, which changes the slope of the potential in the\n\u03c7 direction and traps the flaton field at the origin of the potential [13, 108]. It is\nworthwhile to mention that the potential is stabilized by non-renormalisable terms,\n6\n\nNote, though, that in some GUT models there are additional Higgs fields with much smaller\nvevs [33, 34, 109, 198].\n\n54\n\n\fwith dimensionless couplings \u03bbn \u223c 1 to make the theory valid up to the Planck scale.\nNotice also that the \u03bb4 |\u03c7|4 term is absent in the potential; otherwise, the vacuum\nexpectation value M would not be much bigger than m\u0303\u03c7 , spoiling the suppression\nof the unwanted relics.\nBefore embedding the thermal inflation epoch and the curvaton mechanism into a\nsingle model, we want to clarify some issues about the nature of the interactions that\nproduce the thermal background. If the flaton is a GUT Higgs, it is coupled with\nthose fields charged under the GUT gauge symmetry, in particular with those the\ninflaton field decays into. That collection of particles makes the thermal background,\nand its interaction with the flaton field produces the thermal correction. If the\nflaton field is a gauge singlet it still can be coupled, via Yukawa coupling terms,\nwith some other fields, possibly in a hidden sector, that the inflaton field decays\ninto. Again, a thermal correction is generated. The actual interactions and decay\nrate are not important as the main objective of this chapter and the next one is to\nobtain some particle physics model-independent information about the possibility\nof reconciling low scale inflation with the curvaton mechanism, in a scenario that\ninvolves a second period of inflation (thermal inflation), without going into the\ndetails of the identification of all the relevant fields (inflaton, flaton, and curvaton)\nin the framework of a particle physics model (GUT theories, MSSM, etc.), which\nwould make the results highly particle physics model-dependent. The flaton could\nbe either a gauge singlet or the GUT Higgs. In the former case the flaton can\nbe coupled with some other fields that the inflaton field decays into, via Yukawa\ncoupling terms, and the specific interactions would be known once we choose what\nof the many gauge singlets expected in string theory is the flaton. In the latter case\nthe interactions in the GUT models are already known. The specific interactions\nare important of course, but there are so many possibilities that the general result\nwould be hidden behind the characteristics associated to any definite particle physics\nmodel.\nHaving discussed the nature of the flaton interactions, and guided by the result\nin Ref. [149], we proceed to implement a second inflationary stage into the curvaton\nscenario in order to lower the main inflationary energy scale. If this second epoch\nof inflation is the thermal inflation one devised in Refs. [108, 136, 137] we would be\nsolving not only the issue of the ordinary inflation energy scale but also the moduli\nproblem present in the standard cosmology [10, 39, 42, 56, 57].\nIn the curvaton model supplemented by a thermal inflation epoch two fields\n\u03c7 and \u03c3, which we identify as the flaton and the curvaton fields respectively, are\nembedded into the radiation background left by the inflaton decay. It is assumed\nthat the curvaton field could be either a gauge singlet [172], the Peccei-Quinn field\n[48], a PNGB [40, 50, 86], or a MSSM flat direction [58, 59, 63, 64, 76, 82, 92, 152,\n153, 154, 158, 173, 176], and has just a quadratic interaction with the flaton one so\nthat the unperturbed component is frozen at some value \u03c3\u2217 until the time when the\nflaton field is released from the origin and rolls down towards the minimum of the\npotential. This in turn signals the end of the thermal inflation era and the beginning\n55\n\n\fof the oscillations of the curvaton field around the minimum of its quadratic potential\n[47]. The flaton field, in addition to the non renormalisable terms with \u03bbn \u223c 1 that\nstabilize the potential and make its slope in the \u03c7 direction be very flat, presents\na quadratic interaction with the curvaton field. The complete expression for the\npotential is\nV (\u03c7, \u03c3) = Vh \u2212 (m2\u03c7 \u2212 gT 2 )|\u03c7|2 + m2\u03c3 |\u03c3|2 + \u03bb|\u03c7|2|\u03c3|2 +\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nn=1\n\n2n+4\n\u03bbn m\u22122n\n, (3.41)\nP |\u03c7|\n\nwhere m\u03c7 \u223c 103 GeV due to the soft SUSY contributions in a gravity mediated\nSUSY breaking scheme. Under these circumstances the condition for an inflationary\nperiod, \u03c1total0 + 3Ptotal0 < 0, is satisfied when the global thermal energy density \u03c1r0\nfalls below Vh . Of course, this period of thermal inflation ends when the effect of the\nthermal background becomes unimportant, at a temperature T \u223c m\u03c7 , liberating\nthe flaton field to roll down towards the minimum of the potential and letting it\nacquire a large vacuum expectation value M given by:\n1/2\n\nM\u2243\n\nVh\n.\nm\u03c7\n\n(3.42)\n\nThe evolution of the energy densities associated to the different fluids in this case\nare sketched in Fig. 3.1.\nLet's assume that the usual inflation and its corresponding reheating have already happened, so that the flaton and the curvaton fields are embedded into a\nradiation bath. Therefore, even when the minimum of the potential is located at\n\u03c70 = M\u03c7 (\u03c3\u2217 ) 6= 0 and \u03c30 = 0, \u03c7 is trapped at the origin because of the finitetemperature effects and |\u03c30 | = \u03c3\u2217 6= 0 because m\u03c3 < H < H\u2217 . Thus, the value of\nthe scalar potential at this stage is:\nV (\u03c70 = 0, \u03c30 = \u03c3\u2217 ) = Vh + m2\u03c3 \u03c3\u22172 ,\n\n(3.43)\n\nwith\nm\u03032\u03c7 = 2(n + 1)(m2\u03c7 \u2212 \u03bb|\u03c30 |2 ) ,\n\n(3.44)\n\nM\u03c72n+2 m\u22122n\n= [(n + 2)\u03bbn ]\u22121 (m2\u03c7 \u2212 \u03bb|\u03c30 |2 ) ,\nP\n\u22121\n\nVh = [2(n + 2)]\n\n(m\u03032\u03c7 M\u03c72 ) |\u03c30 =0\n\n.\n\n(3.45)\n(3.46)\n\nWhen the thermal energy density falls below Vh + m2\u03c3 \u03c3\u22172 thermal inflation begins.\nThis period lasts until the temperature is of the order the effective mass of the\nflaton field which is m\u0303\u03c7 = (m2\u03c7 \u2212 \u03bb\u03c3\u22172 )1/2 . Note that \u03bb\u03c3\u22172 < m2\u03c7 because otherwise\nthere is no thermal inflation. Then, we obtain a first constraint on the value of the\nparameter \u03bb:\nm2\n10\u22122 GeV2\n,\n(3.47)\n\u03bb < 2\u03c7 \u223c\n\u03c3\u2217\nH\u22172 \u03a92dec\n56\n\n\flog \u03c1\n\nVh\n\nA B\n\nC\n\nD\n\nlog a\n\nFigure 3.1: Evolution of the energy densities in the thermal inflation model where\nthe curvaton field \u03c3 has some time to oscillate before decaying [51]. The continuous\nline corresponds to the global radiation energy density \u03c1r0 , the dashed dotted line\ncorresponds to the global flaton energy density \u03c1\u03c70 , and the dashed line corresponds\nto the global curvaton energy density \u03c1\u03c30 . The horizontal axis represents the expansion parameter a. From the left to A radiation dominates the energy density,\nalthough it decreases following \u03c1r0 \u221d a\u22124 . At this stage the flaton and curvaton fields\n\u03c7 and \u03c3 are frozen at \u03c70 = 0 and \u03c30 = \u03c3\u2217 making their energy densities constants.\nWhen \u03c1r0 reaches Vh at A, thermal inflation begins. The thermal inflation period\nlasts until B when the temperature T becomes of the order of the flaton mass m\u03c7 .\nThermal inflation stage is portrade by the dashed region. After thermal inflation\nends, the parametric resonance process transforms a substantial fraction of \u03c1\u03c7 into\n\u03c1r [23, 98, 99, 212]. The flaton field is liberated by this time and begins oscillating\naround the minimum of its potential, behaving then as a matter fluid with \u03c1\u03c70 \u221d a\u22123 .\nThe curvaton field increments suddenly its mass m\u03c3 at B as a result of the oscillations of \u03c7 around the vacuum expectation value M, which yields to a much bigger,\nbut still subdominant, \u03c1\u03c3 . The increment is enough for the effective curvaton mass\nm\u0303\u03c3 to overtake Hpt (the Hubble parameter at B) so that \u03c30 gets unfrozen and starts\noscillating around \u03c30 = 0. The curvaton field behaves then as a matter fluid so that\n\u03c1\u03c30 \u221d a\u22123 . By the time C, \u03c7 already dominates the energy density before decaying\ninto radiation. The curvaton field continues to oscillate until D when it decays into\nradiation after having come to dominate (though not necessarily) the total energy\ndensity. The curvature perturbation is transfered to the radiation at this moment\ndue to the decay of \u03c3.\n\n57\n\n\fwhere we have used the Eq. (3.11) and focused on m\u03c7 \u223c 103 GeV which comes from\nthe gravity-mediated SUSY breaking contributions.\nWhen thermal inflation ends the thermal energy density is no longer dominant.\nThe Hubble parameter at the end of thermal inflation is then associated to the\nenergy density coming from the curvaton and the flaton fields:\n2\nHosc\n=\n\nm2\u03c7 M 2\n\u03c1T + V (\u03c70 = 0, \u03c30 = \u03c3\u2217 )\n\u223c\n,\n3m2P\n3m2P\n\n(3.48)\n\nso that\nHosc \u223c 10\u221216 M ,\n\n(3.49)\n\nand therefore the parameter f [cf.

This is to\nallow the curvaton field to decay after the flaton field so that we can keep working\nin the simplest curvaton scenario where the curvaton field oscillates in a radiation\nbackground [138, 139, 159] (see Fig. 3.1).\nMaking use of the constraint in Eq.

Remember that we are going to focus on the gravity-mediated SUSY breaking scheme\nwhere the Hubble parameter during inflation is H\u2217 \u223c m3/2 \u223c 103 GeV. After thermal\ninflation has ended, the flaton and curvaton fields start to oscillate, eventually decaying into thermalised radiation (see Fig. 3.1). The decay process is distinguished\nby the decay rate. The field with the biggest decay rate will decay first. The flaton\nand curvaton decay rates are given by\nm3\u03c7\n\u0393\u03c7 \u2248 \u03b3 \u03c7 2\nM\n\nand\n\n\u0393\u03c3 \u2248 \u03b3 \u03c3\n\nm\u03033\u03c3\n,\nm2P\n\n(3.58)\n\n>\nwith \u03b3\u03c7 <\n\u223c 1 [108, 136, 137] and \u03b3\u03c3 \u223c 1. Since we like the curvaton mechanism not\nto be modified, the flaton field must decay well before the curvaton decay.

The flaton field should be, therefore, one of the\ngauge singlets present in string theory [172].\n\nwhich follows from m\u0303\u03c3 > Hosc .\nIn view of the allowed range of values for M [c.f. Eq.

We must\nremember however that in some other GUT models there are additional Higgs fields\nwith much smaller vevs [33, 34, 109, 198] so they are still good flaton candidates.\nThe flaton field as a gauge singlet in string theory [172] remains as a viable option.\nOnce we have found the required parameter space for \u03bb we must do the same for\nthe other relevant parameter of the Lagrangian: the bare mass of the curvaton m\u03c3 .\nThe only bound on m\u03c3 is\nm\u03c3 < Hosc \u223c 10\u221216 M ,\n(3.71)\nwhich is related to the fact that the oscillations of the curvaton around the minimum\nbegin due to the sudden increment in the curvaton mass at the end of thermal\ninflation.

Since we still need to know if the range\n15\nM <\n\u223c 10 GeV, required to obtain a low-energy scale inflation, is not forbidden by\nthe requirements coming from the solution to the moduli problem, we must find a\n\u03bb-independent relation on M.

This is the lower bound on M we have used throughout\nto satisfy n\u03a6 /s \u223c\nthis chapter. A similar treatment to the abundance of thermal inflation moduli\n16\n[c.f. Eq. (3.80)] leads to the bound M <\n\u223c 10 GeV, which is weaker than that obtained in Fig. 3.2.\nOf course we might have considered the scenario where there are no moduli\nfields at all. Without the introduction of the moduli problem Eq. (3.84) becomes\nunnecessary. This does not help for the improvement of the required range of values\nfor m\u03c3 but it does for \u03bb as the lower bound on M in Eq. (3.84) becomes replaced\nby M \u226b 103 GeV, which comes from the definition of the flaton fields. In this way\nthe range of values for M extends to smaller values well below 1012 GeV until the\ncoupling constant \u03bb eventually reaches the lower bound 10\u22124 .\nThe introduction of a period of thermal inflation into our curvaton scenario,\nsketched in Fig. 3.1, has helped us not only to lower the energy scale of the main\ninflationary epoch, but also to solve the moduli problem [10, 39, 42, 56, 57] still\npresent after ordinary inflation. The required parameter space for \u03bb has been plotted\nin Fig. 3.2, and the vacuum expectation value for the flaton field has been showed\n< M < 1015 GeV. Our flaton field, in view of the\nto be in the range 1012 GeV \u223c\n\u223c\nallowed range of values for M, should be one of the gauge singlets present in string\n< 10\u22121 GeV, suggests\ntheory [172]. The upper bound on m\u03c3 [c.f. Eq. (3.72)], m\u03c3 \u223c\nthe curvaton field could be a PNGB [40, 50, 86]. This is because in the presence\nof supergravity all the scalar fields, whose masses are not protected by a global\n< m3/2 , and\nsymmetry, acquire soft masses of the order of the gravitino mass if H \u223c\n2\n>\ncontributions contributions to the squared mass of order H if H \u223c m3/2 except\nduring the radiation dominated era [128]. The smallness of the curvaton mass is\nin turn because of the very small value for Hosc . The parameter Hosc is directly\nproportional to M, so the bigger M is, the more possible to obtain a range of values\nfor m\u03c3 compatible with the soft supersymmetric contributions. We, in the next\n64\n\n\fchapter, will look for a mechanism to improve the required range of values for the\nbare mass m\u03c3 and the coupling constant \u03bb in presence of the moduli problem [189].\n\n3.4\n\nConclusions\n\nWe have presented a different type of curvaton scenario [51], in which the scale of\ninflation can be much lower than H\u2217 \u223c 107 GeV, which is the default lower bound\nfor the standard curvaton model [126]. This scenario considers a curvaton, whose\nmass, being appropriately Higgsed, is substantially enlarged at a phase transition\nafter the end of inflation ('heavy curvaton'). We have shown that this mechanism\nis indeed able to accommodate inflation scales as low as H\u2217 \u223c 1 TeV or even lower.\nWe have implemented the idea of a thermal inflation epoch, introduced in Refs.\n[108, 136, 137] to solve the moduli problem, as a second inflationary period necessary to lower the energy scale of the main inflationary stage. In our model, a\nflaton field \u03c7 with bare mass coming from soft supersymmetric contributions and\n< M < 1015 GeV (i.e. one of the\nvacuum expectation value in the range 1012 GeV \u223c\n\u223c\ngauge singlets in string theory [172]), is held at the origin of the scalar potential by\nfinite-temperature effects. These effects are associated to the thermal background\ncreated by the main reheating epoch. When temperature falls below Vh thermal\ninflation begins. This period of thermal inflation lasts around ten e-folds until the\ntemperature falls below m\u03c7 liberating the flaton field to roll away towards the minimum of the potential. The curvaton field is coupled to the flaton one, through a\n< \u03bb < 10\u221210 , so its mass is largely increased\ncoupling constant \u03bb in the range 10\u221222 \u223c\n\u223c\nat the end of thermal inflation. This increment is enough to lower the bound on H\u2217\nto satisfactory levels, without sending the non-gaussianity constraint to the limit.\nHowever, the energy scale of the thermal inflation epoch is very small, requiring in\nturn a bare mass for the curvaton field of at most 10\u22124 \u2212 10\u22121 GeV. Taking into\naccount the soft supersymmetric contributions to m\u03c3 , the required smallness of m\u03c3\npoints toward using a PNGB curvaton [40, 50, 86] to achieve low-scale inflation.\nThe type of mechanism that we presented is not completely compelling. It\nsuffers from the problem that the mass of the curvaton before oscillation, as well as\nits coupling, have to be much smaller than one would expect. In the next chapter\n[189] it will be shown how this tuning problem can be at least alleviated.\n\n65\n\n\fChapter 4\nLow scale inflation and the\nimmediate heavy curvaton decay\n4.1\n\nIntroduction\n\nLow scale inflation is desirable in order to identify the inflaton field with one of the\nMSSM flat directions [27, 93] or with one of the fields appearing in the SUSY breaking sector, giving the inflaton a much deeper particle physics root. In contrast low\nscale inflation is not desirable because it makes very difficult the generation of the\nadiabatic perturbations by the inflaton, leading to multiple fine-tuning and modelbuilding problems, unless the curvaton mechanism is invoked [138, 139, 159] (see\nalso Refs. [66, 116, 156]). With the aim of generating the curvature perturbation\nthat gives origin to the large-scale structure in the observable universe, the curvaton\nmechanism has appeared as a nice and plausible option and a lot of research has\nbeen devoted to its study. Making the curvaton mechanism viable in a low energy\ninflationary framework would be the ideal situation but, unfortunately, the simplest\ncurvaton model has shown to be incompatible with low enough values for the Hubble parameter during inflation [126]. Some general proposals to make the curvaton\nparadigm accommodate low scale inflation have recently appeared and specific models have been studied too [51, 149, 175]. In the previous chapter, a thermal inflation\nepoch was attached to the general curvaton mechanism making the curvaton field\ngain a huge increment in the mass at the end of the thermal inflationary period, triggering this way a period of curvaton oscillations, and lowering the main inflationary\nscale to satisfactory levels [51]. However, the parameters of the model required for\nthis effect to take place showed to be extremely small to affect the reliability of the\nmodel. The purpose of this chapter is to study the same mechanism but in the case\nwhere the increment in the mass is so huge that the decay rate becomes bigger than\nthe Hubble parameter and the curvaton decays immediately [189]. The results are\nvery positive, offering a more natural parameter space.\n\n66\n\n\f4.2\n\nThermal inflation and the immediate heavy\ncurvaton decay\n\nThe thermal inflation model has been investigated before and found to be a very\nefficient mechanism to dilute the abundance of some unwanted relics, like the moduli\nfields, that the main inflationary epoch is not able to get rid of (see Refs. [136, 137]).\nWe will constrain the available parameter space for \u03bb and m\u03c3 in the scalar potential\nof Eq. (3.41) so that enough dilution of the moduli abundance is obtained. In\nChapter 3 this was done for the case in which the flaton-curvaton coupling term\ngives a huge contribution to the mass of the curvaton when the flaton field is released\nand gets its vacuum expectation value M. In that case the effective curvaton mass\nm\u0303\u03c3 may become bigger than the Hubble parameter giving birth to a period of\ncurvaton oscillations and making the scale of the main inflationary period low enough\n(H\u2217 \u223c m3/2 \u223c 103 GeV) to think about the inflaton as a field associated to the SUSY\nbreaking sector [126, 149, 175]. The evolution of the energy densities associated to\nthe different fluids in that case are sketched in Fig. 3.1.\nThe purpose of this chapter is to analyse the scenario where there are no oscillations of the curvaton field. As it was pointed out in Ref. [175] both the curvaton\ndecay rate and the associated lower bound [c.f. Eq. (3.23)]\nm\u03033\u03c3\n\u0393\u03c3 \u2265 2 ,\nmP\n\n(4.1)\n\nare also increased when the flaton field acquires its vacuum expectation value so that,\nif this increment is big enough for the curvaton decay rate to be bigger than the\nHubble parameter, the curvaton field may decay immediately rather than oscillating\nfor some time. Low scale inflation in this case is also possible to be attained [51, 175],\nbut the lower bound on H\u2217 changes with respect to the case when the curvaton\noscillatory process is triggered. The evolution of the energy densities associated to\nthe different fluids in this case are sketched in Fig. 4.1.\nIn the scenario where curvaton oscillations are allowed, corresponding to \u0393\u03c3 < Hpt ,\nthe lower bound on H\u2217 is [c.f. Eqs. (3.22), (3.26), and (3.30)]\nH\u2217 \u2265 max{ f 4/5 \u00d7 107 GeV,\n\nq\n\nf \u03b4 2 \u00d7 1011 GeV, \u03b4 4 \u00d7 107 GeV } ,\n\n(4.2)\n\nwhere f and \u03b4, given by Eqs. (3.13) and (3.27), are less than 1, and with Hosc = Hpt\nbeing the Hubble parameter at the end of the thermal inflation period (which also\ncorresponds to the beginning of the curvaton oscillations). In contrast, the lower\nbound in the scenario where the curvaton field decays immediately, corresponding\nto \u0393\u03c3 > Hpt , is [c.f. Eqs. (3.22) and (3.34)]\nH\u2217 \u2265 max{ f 4/5 \u00d7 107 GeV, f \u00d7 1014 GeV } ,\n\n(4.3)\n\nwhich may challenge the WMAP constraint for the curvaton scenario [49] leading\nto excessive curvature perturbations from the inflaton field if f is not much smaller\nthan unity.\n67\n\n\flog \u03c1\n\nVh\n\nA B\n\nC\n\nlog a\n\nFigure 4.1: Evolution of the energy densities in the thermal inflation model where\nthe curvaton field \u03c3 decays immediately at the end of thermal inflation [189]. The\ncontinuous line corresponds to the global radiation energy density \u03c1r0 , the dashed\ndotted line corresponds to the global flaton energy density \u03c1\u03c70 , and the dashed line\ncorresponds to the global curvaton energy density \u03c1\u03c30 . The horizontal axis represents\nthe expansion parameter a. From the left to A radiation dominates the energy\ndensity, although it decreases following \u03c1r0 \u221d a\u22124 . At this stage the unperturbed\ncomponents of the flaton and curvaton fields \u03c7 and \u03c3 are frozen at \u03c70 = 0 and\n\u03c30 = \u03c3\u2217 making their energy densities constants. When \u03c1r0 reaches Vh at A, thermal\ninflation begins. The thermal inflation period lasts until B when the temperature\nT becomes of the order of the flaton mass m\u03c7 . Thermal inflation is portrade by\nthe dashed region. After thermal inflation ends, the parametric resonance process\ntransforms a substantial fraction of \u03c1\u03c7 into \u03c1r [23, 98, 99, 212]. The flaton field is\nliberated by this time and begins oscillating around the minimum of its potential,\nbehaving then as a matter fluid with \u03c1\u03c70 \u221d a\u22123 . The curvaton field increments\nsuddenly its mass m\u03c3 at B as a result of the oscillations of \u03c7 around the vacuum\nexpectation value M. The increment is enough for the decay rate \u0393\u03c3 to overtake Hpt\n(the Hubble parameter at B) so that \u03c3 decays immediately. The curvaton energy\ndensity is transfered then completely to \u03c1r as it is the curvature perturbation too. By\nthe time C, \u03c7 already dominates the energy density before decaying into radiation.\n\n68\n\n\fThe lower bound in Eq. (4.2), for H\u2217 \u223c 103 GeV, was shown in the previous\nchapter to be satisfied for very small values for the flaton-curvaton coupling constant,\n\u03bb \u223c 10\u221222 \u2212 10\u221210 (see Fig. 3.2), and very small values for the bare mass of the\n< 10\u22121 GeV [c.f. Eq. (3.72)], which suggests that the curvaton\ncurvaton field, m\u03c3 \u223c\nfield could be a PNGB [40, 50, 86]. This is, in any case, a quite negative result due\nto the required smallness of the parameters \u03bb and m\u03c3 . However, when taking into\naccount the lower bound in Eq. (4.3), corresponding to the case when the decay\nrate \u0393\u03c3 becomes bigger than Hpt , things change appreciably.\n\n4.2.1\n\nThe flaton-curvaton coupling constant \u03bb\n\nThermal inflation ends when the thermal energy density is no longer dominant;\nthus, the Hubble parameter at the end of thermal inflation is associated to the\nenergy density coming from the curvaton and the flaton fields:\n2\nHpt\n=\n\nm2\u03c7 M 2\n\u03c1T + V (\u03c7 = 0, \u03c30 = \u03c3\u2217 )\n\u223c\n,\n3m2P\n3m2P\n\n(4.4)\n\nso that\nHpt \u223c 10\u221216 M .\n\n(4.5)\n\nSince the effective mass of the curvaton field after the end of thermal inflation, i.e.,\nwhen \u03c7\u0304 = M\u03c7 is the average over oscillations of the flaton field and \u03c30 = 0, is\n\u221a\n(4.6)\nm\u0303\u03c3 = (m2\u03c3 + \u03bbM 2 )1/2 \u2248 \u03bbM ,\nthe parameter f [cf.

(4.3) and (4.7) the smallest possible value for \u03bb, compatible\nwith H\u2217 \u223c 103 GeV, becomes \u03bb \u223c 10\u221210 , which is very good because this already\nimproves the results found in the previous chapter. Moreover, the effective flaton\nmass during thermal inflation m\u0303\u03c7 = (m2\u03c7 \u2212 \u03bb\u03c3\u22172 )1/2 must be positive to trap the\nflaton field at the origin of the potential. Thus, \u03bb\u03c3\u22172 < m2\u03c7 , and the biggest possible\nvalue for \u03bb becomes [c.f. Eq.

A smaller upper bound for\n\u03bb could be a possibility, according to Eq.

(4.9), valid when the curvaton\nhas some time to oscillate before decaying (see Subsection 3.3.2).\n\n4.2.2\n\nThe bare curvaton mass m\u03c3\n\nThe only bound on m\u03c3 is given by the fact that in the heavy curvaton scenario the\nbare mass must be smaller than the Hubble parameter at the end of the thermal\ninflation era, so that the sudden increment in the mass and the decay rate leads to\n70\n\n\fthe immediate decay of the field avoiding in this case the oscillations. Thus,\nm\u03c3 < Hpt \u223c 10\u221216 M ,\n\n(4.11)\n\nso we need to worry about the possible values for M. In the scenario where the\ncurvaton field decays immediately the flaton field is left immersed in a background of\nradiation, so it must decay before the time of nucleosynthesis in order not to disturb\nthe abundances of the light elements. By setting \u0393\u03c7 \u2243 H we get the temperature\njust after the flaton decay\n1\n(4.12)\nT\u03c7 \u2243 1013 GeV2 ,\nM\nwhich must be bigger than 1 MeV to satisfy the nucleosynthesis constraint. Therefore\n< 1016 GeV ,\nM \u223c\n(4.13)\n< 1 GeV, which is\nleading to an upper bound on the bare curvaton mass given by m\u03c3 \u223c\nagain a more relaxed constraint than that found in the previous chapter for the case\nof an oscillating curvaton, but that still reduces the number of possible curvaton\ncandidates, leaving essentially the PNGB [40, 50, 86]. Recalling, in the scenario\nwhere curvaton oscillations are allowed the bare curvaton mass m\u03c3 is in the range\n[c.f. Eq.

The latter\nallowed range for M means that, unlike the case where the curvaton has some time\nto oscillate before decaying, the flaton field could be the GUT Higgs field studied in\nRef. [136].\n\n4.3\n\nSome useful remarks\n\nBefore concluding, we want to stress some points that can help to avoid possible\nconfusion. The parameter space compatible with low scale inflation is a feature of\nthe specific model studied, and we cannot say it is the same for all classes of models\nin the basis of Eqs. (3.22), (3.26), and (3.30), which provide just some general\nbounds. That is why specific models have been studied (see Refs. [51, 175]), even\nwhen the general bounds were already known from Refs. [126, 149]. Although the\nclaim, that the available parameter space is bigger for the immediate curvaton decay,\nwas given before in Ref. [175], we again cannot say that the available parameter\nspace is the same for all classes of models in the basis of the bounds required to\nhave low energy scale inflation. For example, from Eq. (4.5), Hpt depends on M so\nthere is no direct bound on it unless we know the bound on M 3 . The bound on M\ncomes in turn from the requirement that the flaton decays before nucleosynthesis\n[c.f. Eqs. (4.12) and (4.13)] and must be consistent with the adequate suppression\nof the thermal inflation moduli [c.f. Eqs. (4.22) and (4.23)]. These are, of course,\nfeatures specific only to the model we are studying, and are therefore not present in\nRef. [175].\nNaively, one would think that the bounds on \u03bb and m\u03c3 are found from that on\nHpt only through a mere change of variables. This is of course not true as the bound\non Hpt is a very sensitive quantity that has to avoid disturbing the nucleosynthesis\nprocess and the adequate moduli abundance suppression. It is worth mentioning\nthat the scenario discussed in this chapter differs appreciably from that studied in\nChapter 3, due to the immediate curvaton decay, so that the conditions to satisfy the\nnucleosynthesis and thermal inflation moduli constraints are completely different4 .\nFinally, the agreement between the bounds found in Ref. [175] (which are supposed to be general) and those found in this chapter is apparent and corresponds\njust to a mere coincidence. We justify this observation by noting that Eq. (6) in\nRef. [175] is essentially the same as our Eq. (3.16), the latter being generalized to\ngive Eq. (3.22), except for \u0393\u03c3 which in our Eq. (3.16) appears to be Hdec . The\nexpressions in the previous chapter were carefully derived so that the correct expression is that given there [51] . In contrast, Eq. (6) in Ref. [175] is just valid\nfor the standard case where the curvaton field has some time to oscillate before\n3\n\nNotice that the bounds required to have low energy scale inflation [c.f. Eq. (4.3)] depend only\non the ratio f = Hpt /m\u0303\u03c3 , and not exclusively on Hpt .\n4\nFor example, the expressions for the big-bang and thermal inflation moduli abundances in\nChapter 3 [c.f. Eqs. (3.78) and (3.80)] are different from those in this chapter [c.f. Eqs. (4.20) and\n(4.22)].\n\n73\n\n\fdecaying, so we can identify \u0393\u03c3 with Hdec . However, for the immediate decay case,\n\u0393\u03c3 > Hdec = Hpt , which renders Eq. (6) in Ref. [175] invalid. Based on the previous\ndiscussion we claim that the bound Hpt < 1 GeV, as are those on \u03bb and m\u03c3 , is\npresented in this thesis for the first time in a correct way.\n\n4.4\n\nConclusions\n\nIn this chapter we have investigated the required parameter space compatible with\nlow scale inflation in the thermal inflation curvaton scenario where there are no\noscillations of the curvaton field [189]. We have shown that the parameter space\nis greatly enhanced when the increment in the curvaton decay rate is big enough\nfor the curvaton field to decay immediately at the end of the thermal inflation era.\nThe best case corresponds to a flaton-curvaton coupling constant \u03bb \u223c 10\u22124 and a\nbare curvaton mass m\u03c3 \u223c 1 GeV, which are much bigger and more natural than\n< \u03bb < 10\u221210 and m\u03c3 < 10\u22121 GeV found previously in Chapter 3\nthe ranges 10\u221222 \u223c\n\u223c\n\u223c\nfor the case where the curvaton oscillates for some time before decaying [51]. In\n< M < 1016 GeV for the vacuum expectation value\naddition we have found 109 GeV \u223c\n\u223c\nM of the flaton field. Therefore, our flaton field as the GUT Higgs field discussed\nin Ref. [136] is a viable option in this scenario.\n\n74\n\n\fChapter 5\nNon-gaussianity from the\nsecond-order cosmological\nperturbation\n5.1\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn chapters 2, 3, and 4, we discussed some of the theoretical aspects of the origin of\nthe large-scale structure in the Universe, emphasising the possibility to achieve low\nscale inflation in the curvaton scenario. We begin now the discussion of the statistical\naspects, specifically the presence of non-gaussianities in the fields responsible for the\norigin of the curvature perturbation \u03b6 and/or in \u03b6 itself. Chapters 5 and 6 will deal\nwith such an interesting subject.\nCosmological scales leave the horizon during inflation and re-enter it after Big\nBang Nucleosynthesis. Throughout the super-horizon era it is very useful to define\na primordial cosmological curvature perturbation, which is conserved if and only\nif pressure throughout the Universe is a unique function of energy density (the\nadiabatic pressure condition) (see Subsection 2.2.3) [11, 12, 124, 127, 179, 193, 222].\nObservation directly constrains the curvature perturbation at the very end of the\nsuper-horizon era, a few Hubble times before cosmological scales start to enter the\nhorizon, when it apparently sets the initial condition for the subsequent evolution of\nall cosmological perturbations. As discussed in Chapter 2, the observed curvature\nperturbation is almost Gaussian with an almost scale-invariant spectrum.\nCosmological perturbation theory expands the exact equations in powers of the\nperturbations and keeps terms only up to the nth order. Since the observed curvature perturbation is of order 10\u22125 , one might think that first-order perturbation\ntheory will be adequate for all comparisons with observation. That may not be the\ncase however, because the PLANCK satellite [171] and its successors may be sensitive to non-gaussianity of the curvature perturbation at the level of second-order\nperturbation theory [103].\nSeveral authors have treated the non-gaussianity of the primordial curvature\n75\n\n\fperturbation in the context of second-order perturbation theory. They have adopted\ndifferent definitions of the curvature perturbation and obtained results for a variety\nof situations. In this chapter we revisit the calculations, using a single definition of\nthe curvature perturbation which we denote by \u03b6 [131]. In some cases we disagree\nwith the findings of the original authors.\nThe outline of this chapter is the following: in Section 5.2 we review two definitions of the curvature perturbation found in the literature, which are valid during\nand after inflation, and establish definite relationships between them; in section 5.3\nwe review a third curvature perturbation definition, which applies only during inflation, and study it in models of inflation of the slow-roll variety; in Section 5.4 we\ndescribe the present framework for thinking about the origin and evolution of the\ncurvature perturbation; in Section 5.5 we see how non-gaussianity is defined and\nconstrained by observation; in Section 5.6 we study the initial non-gaussianity of\nthe curvature perturbation, a few Hubble times after horizon exit; in Section 5.7 we\nstudy its subsequent evolution according to some different models. The conclusions\nare summarised in Section 5.8.\nWe shall denote unperturbed quantities by a subscript 0, and generally work with\nconformal time \u03b7. Sometimes though we revert to physical time t. We shall adopt\nthe convention that a generic perturbation g is split into a first- and second-order\npart according to the formula\n1\ng = g1 + g2 .\n(5.1)\n2\n\n5.2\n5.2.1\n\nTwo definitions of the curvature perturbation\nPreliminaries\n\nCosmological perturbations describe small departures of the actual Universe, away\nfrom some perfect homogeneous and isotropic universe with the line element in\nEq. (2.2). For a generic perturbation it is convenient to make the Fourier expansion\ng(x, \u03b7) =\n\n1 Z 3\nd k gk (\u03b7)eik*x ,\n(2\u03c0)3/2\n\n(5.2)\n\nwhere the spacetime coordinates are those of the unperturbed Universe. The inverse\nof the comoving wavenumber, k \u22121 , is often referred to as the scale. Except where otherwise stated, our discussion applies only to the super-horizon regime (k \u226a aHinf ).\nWhen evaluating an observable quantity only a limited range of scales will be\ninvolved. The largest scale, relevant for the low multipoles of the Cosmic Microwave\n\u22121\nBackground anisotropy, is k \u22121 \u223c Htoday\nwhere Htoday is the present Hubble parameter. The smallest scale usually considered is the one enclosing matter with mass\n\u22121\n\u223c 106 M\u2299 , which corresponds to k \u22121 \u223c 10\u22122 Mpc \u223c 10\u22126 Htoday\n. The cosmological\nrange of scales therefore extends over only six orders of magnitude or so.\nTo define cosmological perturbations in general, one has to introduce in the\nperturbed Universe a coordinate system (t, xi ), which defines a slicing of spacetime\n76\n\n\f(fixed t) and a threading (fixed xi ). To define the curvature perturbation it is enough\nto define the slicing [127].\n\n5.2.2\n\nTwo definitions of the curvature perturbation\n\nIn this chapter we take as our definition of \u03b6 the following expression for the spatial\nmetric [38, 43, 44, 127, 142, 181, 183, 193, 199, 200] which applies non-perturbatively:\ngij = a2 (\u03b7)\u03b3\u0303ij e2\u03b6 .\n\n(5.3)\n\nHere \u03b3\u0303ij has unit determinant, and the time-slicing is one of uniform energy density1 .\nIt has been shown under weak assumptions [127] that this defines \u03b6 uniquely,\nand that \u03b6 is conserved as long as the pressure is a unique function of energy density.\nAlso, it has been shown that the uniform density slicing practically coincides with\nthe comoving slicing (orthogonal to the flow of energy), and with the uniform Hubble\nslicing (corresponding to uniform proper expansion, that expansion being practically\nindependent of the threading which defines it) [127]. The coincidence of these slicings\nis important since all three have been invoked by different authors.\nSince the matrix \u03b3\u0303 has unit determinant it can be written \u03b3\u0303 = Ieh , where I is\nthe unit matrix and h is traceless [127]. Assuming that the initial condition is set\nby inflation, h corresponds to a tensor perturbation (gravitational wave amplitude)\nwhich will be negligible unless the scale of inflation is very high. As we shall see later\n(see footnote 12 in this chapter), the results we are going to present are valid even\nif h is not negligible, but to simplify the presentation we drop h from the equations.\nAccordingly, the space part of the metric in the super-horizon regime is supposed\nto be well approximated by\n(5.4)\ngij = a2 (\u03b7)\u03b4ij e2\u03b6 .\nAt first order, Eq. (5.4) corresponds to\ngij = a2 (\u03b7)\u03b4ij (1 + 2\u03b6) .\n\n(5.5)\n\nUp to a sign, this is the definition of the first-order curvature perturbation adopted\nby all authors [c.f. Eqs. (2.3) and (2.15)]. There is no universally agreed convention\nfor the sign of \u03b6. Ours coincides with the convention of most of the papers to which\nwe refer, and we have checked carefully that the signs in our own set of equations\nare correct.\nAt second order we have\ngij = a2 (\u03b7)\u03b4ij (1 + 2\u03b6 + 2\u03b6 2 ) .\n\n(5.6)\n\nThis is our definition of \u03b6 at second order [131].\n1\n\nIt is proved in Ref. [127] that this definition of \u03b6 coincides with that of Lyth and Wands\n[140], provided that their slices of uniform coordinate expansion are taken to correspond to those\non which the line element has the form Eq. (5.3) without the factor e2\u03b6 (this makes the slices\npractically flat if \u03b3\u0303ij \u2243 \u03b4ij ).\n\n77\n\n\fMalik and Wands [145] instead defined \u03b6 by Eq. (5.5) even at second order.\nDenoting their definition by a subscript MW,\n\nor equivalently\n\n\u03b6 MW = \u03b6 + \u03b6 2 ,\n\n(5.7)\n\n\u03b62MW = \u03b62 + 2 (\u03b61 )2 ,\n\n(5.8)\n\nwhere \u03b61 is the first-order quantity whose definition Eq. (5.5) is agreed by all authors.\nTo make contact with calculations of the curvature perturbation during inflation,\nwe need some gauge-invariant expressions for the curvature perturbation. As stated\nin Subsections 2.2.2 and 2.2.3, 'gauge-invariant' means that the definition is valid\nfor any choice of the coordinate system which defines the slicing and threading2 .\nWe shall write gauge-invariant expressions in terms of \u03b6 and \u03b6 MW . First we\nconsider a quantity \u03c8 MW , defined even at second order by\ngij = a2 (\u03b7)\u03b4ij (1 \u2212 2\u03c8 MW ) .\n\n(5.9)\n\nThis definition, which is written in analogy to Eq. (5.5), applies to a generic slicing.\nAnalogously to Eq. (5.4) we can consider a quantity \u03c8, valid also in a generic slicing,\ndefined by\ngij = a2 (\u03b7)\u03b4ij e\u22122\u03c8 .\n(5.10)\nOn uniform-density slices, \u03c81 = \u03c81MW = \u2212\u03b61 , \u03c82MW = \u2212\u03b62MW , and \u03c82 = \u2212\u03b62 . We\nshall also need the energy density perturbation \u03b4\u03c1, defined on the generic slicing, as\nwell as the unperturbed energy density \u03c10 .\nAt first order, the gauge-invariant expression for \u03b6 has the well-known form\n[c.f. Eq. (2.15)]\n\u03b4\u03c11\n\u03b61 = \u2212\u03c81 \u2212 H \u2032 ,\n(5.11)\n\u03c10\nwhere H = a\u2032 /a, and the unperturbed energy density satisfies \u03c1\u20320 = \u22123H(\u03c10 + P0 )\nwith P0 being the unperturbed pressure. This expression obviously is correct for the\nuniform density slicing, and it is correct for all slicings because the changes in the\nfirst and second terms induced by a change in the slicing cancel [11, 12, 36, 124, 147].\nAt second order, Malik and Wands show that [145]\n\u03b62MW = \u2212\u03c82MW \u2212 H\n\u03b4\u03c11\n\u2212 H \u2032\n\u03c10\n\n!2\n\n\u03b4\u03c11 \u03b4\u03c1\u20321\n\u03b4\u03c11\n\u03b4\u03c12\n+\n2H\n+ 2 \u2032 (\u03c81\u2032 + 2H\u03c81 )\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u03c10\n\u03c10 \u03c10\n\u03c10\nH\u2032\n\u03c1\u2032\u20320\n\u2212\n\u22122 ,\nH\u03c1\u20320 H2\n!\n\n(5.12)\n\nwhich is, again and for the same reason as before, obviously correct for all the\nslices.

We consider single-component inflation, during which the curvature perturbation \u03b6 is conserved, and multi-component inflation during which it varies. After defining both\nparadigms, we give a third definition of the curvature perturbation which applies\nonly during inflation.\n\n5.3.1\n\nSingle-component inflation\n\nIn a single-component inflation model [112, 130] the inflaton trajectory is by definition essentially unique. The inflaton field \u03c6 parameterises the distance along the\ninflaton trajectory. In terms of the field variation, slow-roll inflation (see Subsection\n2.5.1) is characterised by the slow-roll conditions [111, 112, 130]\n\u1e22inf\n\u03b5 \u2261 \u2212\n2\nHinf\n|\u03b7\u03c6 \u2212 \u03b5| \u2261\n\n!\n\n\u2217\n\n\u226a 1,\n\n\u03c6\u03080\n\u226a 1.\nHinf \u03c6\u03070\n\n(5.15)\n(5.16)\n\nThe inflaton field can be taken to be canonically normalised, in which case these\ndefinitions are equivalent to conditions on the potential V\nm2P \u2202V\n\u03b5 \u2261\n2V 2 \u2202\u03c60\nm2P \u2202 2 V\n,\n\u03b7\u03c6 \u2261\nV \u2202\u03c620\n\n!2\n\n,\n\n(5.17)\n(5.18)\n\nwhich, together with the slow-roll approximation, lead to the slow-roll behaviour\n3Hinf \u03c6\u03070 \u2248 \u2212\n3\n\n\u2202V\n.\n\u2202\u03c60\n\n(5.19)\n\nThis relation has recently been confirmed in Ref. [106] (see also Ref. [107]) using a nonlinear\ncoordinate-free approach.\n\n79\n\n\fEven without the slow-roll approximation, slices of uniform \u03c6 correspond to\ncomoving slices because a spatial gradient of \u03c6 would give non-vanishing momentum\ndensity. Since comoving slices coincide with slices of uniform energy density, the\nslices of uniform \u03c6 coincide also with the latter. Also, since \u03c6 is a Lorentz scalar, its\ngauge transformation is the same as that of \u03c1. It follows [217] that we can replace\n\u03c1 by \u03c6 in the above expressions:\n\u03b4\u03c61\n,\n\u03c6\u20320\n\u03b4\u03c61 \u03b4\u03c6\u20321\n\u03b4\u03c61\n\u03b4\u03c62\n+ 2 \u2032 (\u03c81\u2032 + 2Hinf \u03c81 )\n= \u2212\u03c82MW \u2212 Hinf \u2032 + 2Hinf \u2032\n\u2032\n\u03c60\n\u03c60 \u03c60\n\u03c60\n\n\u03b61 = \u2212\u03c81 \u2212 Hinf\n\u03b62MW\n\n!2\n\n\u03b62\n\n\u2032\nHinf\n\u03c6\u2032\u20320\n\u03b4\u03c61\n\u22122 ,\n\u2212\n\u2212 Hinf \u2032\n2\n\u03c60\nHinf \u03c6\u20320 Hinf\n\u03b4\u03c62\n\u03b4\u03c61 \u03b4\u03c6\u20321\n\u03b4\u03c61\n= \u2212\u03c82 \u2212 Hinf \u2032 + 2Hinf \u2032\n+ 2 \u2032 \u03c81\u2032\n\u2032\n\u03c60\n\u03c60 \u03c60\n\u03c60\n\n\u03b4\u03c61\n\u2212 Hinf \u2032\n\u03c60\n\n5.3.2\n\n!2\n\n!\n\n\u2032\nHinf\n\u03c6\u2032\u20320\n\u2212\n2\nHinf \u03c6\u20320 Hinf\n\n!\n\n.\n\n(5.20)\n\n(5.21)\n\n(5.22)\n\nMulti-component inflation\n\nNow consider the case of multi-component inflation, where there is a family of inequivalent inflationary trajectories lying in an N-dimensional manifold of field space.\nIf the relevant part of the manifold is not too big it will be a good approximation to\ntake the fields to be canonically normalised. Then the inequivalent trajectories will\nbe curved in field space4 . To define the trajectories one can choose a fixed basis in\nfield space corresponding to fields \u03c61 , * * * , \u03c6N .\nAssuming canonical normalisation, multi-component slow-roll inflation is characterised by the conditions\n!2\n\n\u2202V\nm2P\n2\n2V\n\u2202\u03c6n0\nm2P\n\u22022V\nV \u2202\u03c6n0 \u2202\u03c6m0\n\n3Hinf \u03c6\u0307n0\n\n\u226a 1,\n\n(5.23)\n\n\u226a 1,\n\n(5.24)\n\n\u2248 \u2212\n\n\u2202V\n.\n\u2202\u03c6n0\n\n(5.25)\n\nThe procedure of choosing a fixed basis is quite convenient for calculations, but\na different procedure leads to a perhaps simpler theoretical description. This is\nto take \u03c6 to parameterise the distance along the inflaton trajectories, just as in\nsingle-component inflation, but now with the proviso that uniform \u03c6 corresponds\n4\nMore generally they will be non-geodesics, the geodesics being the trajectories which the\nbackground fields could follow if there was no potential term in the scalar Lagrangian [178].\n\n80\n\n\f\u03b8\n\u03c6\nV = const\n\n\u03c6\n\nV = const\n\n\u03b8\n\nV = const\n\nV = const\nV = const\nV = const\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 5.1: Two different procedures for defining the fields in two-component inflation. The fields are denoted by \u03c6 and \u03b8. (a) The field \u03c6 parameterises the distance\nalong the inflaton trajectories, with uniform \u03c6 corresponding to the equipotential\nlines. The field \u03b8 parameterises the distance along the equipotentials. (b) The\nfields \u03c6 and \u03b8 are the components in a fixed orthonormal basis, aligned with the\ninflationary trajectory at a certain point in field space. The value of \u03c6 is now\nthe displacement along the tangent vector and the value of \u03b8 is the displacement\nalong the orthogonal vector. Working to second order in these displacements, the\nequipotentials no longer coincide with the lines of uniform \u03c6.\n\nto uniform field potential (since we work in the slow-roll approximation, this means\nthat the slices in field space of uniform \u03c6 are orthogonal to the trajectories). Then,\nin the slow-roll approximation, slices of spacetime with uniform \u03c6 will again coincide\nwith slices of uniform density (see Fig. 5.1a). Since \u03c6 is a scalar, Eqs. (5.20) and\n(5.21) will then be valid. This is the simplest form of the gauge-invariant expression,\nthough for a practical calculation it may be better to write it in terms of a fixed\nbasis.\nThere is a subtlety here. For the first-order case we could define \u03c6 in a different\nway; around a given point on the unperturbed trajectory we could choose a fixed\nfield basis, with one of the basis vectors pointing along the trajectory, and define \u03c6\nas the corresponding field component. Then we could choose \u03c6 to be canonically\nnormalised in the vicinity of the chosen point in field space. That would not work\nat second order though, because at that order it makes a difference whether \u03c6 is\nthe appropriate parameterisation of the distance along the trajectories (our adopted\ndefinition) or the distance along a tangent vector to the trajectory (the alternative\ndefinition) (see Fig. 5.1b). Only our adopted one will make Eqs. (5.21) and (5.22)\nvalid.\n\n81\n\n\f5.3.3\n\nA third definition of the curvature perturbation\n\nThe third definition in the literature applies only during inflation. It was given originally by Acquaviva et. al. [3] for the single-component case, and the generalization\nto the multi-component case was noted by Rigopoulos [178]. We shall denote this\ndefinition by \u03b6 A .\nThe definition of Acquaviva et. al. and Rigopoulos is\n\u03b62A = \u2212\u03c82MW \u2212 Hinf\n\n\u03b4\u03c62 (\u03c81\u2032 + 2Hinf \u03c81 + Hinf \u03b4\u03c6\u20321 /\u03c6\u20320 )2\n\u2212\n.\n\u2032\n2\n\u03c6\u20320\nHinf\n+ 2Hinf\n\u2212 Hinf \u03c6\u2032\u20320 /\u03c6\u20320\n\n(5.26)\n\nThis is gauge-invariant by construction, with \u03c6 defined as in Figure 1(a).\nIt was pointed out by Vernizzi [217] (actually in the context of single-component\ninflation) that comparing this definition with Eq. (5.21) gives simply\n\u03b62A = \u03b62MW \u2212\n\n\u2032\nHinf\n\n2\n4Hinf\n(\u03b61 )2\n.\n2\n+ 2Hinf\n\u2212 Hinf \u03c6\u2032\u20320 /\u03c6\u20320\n\n(5.27)\n\n2\nIn the limit of slow-roll the denominator of the last term becomes just 2Hinf\n, and\nthen\n\n\u03b62A = \u03b62 .\n\n(5.28)\n\nIn other words, this third definition coincides with our adopted one in the slow-roll\nlimit.\nMaking use of the slow-roll parameters in Eqs. (5.15) and (5.16), the expression\nin Eq. (5.27) gives to first-order in the slow-roll approximation\n\u03b62A = \u03b62 \u2212 (2\u03b5 \u2212 \u03b7\u03c6 )(\u03b61 )2 .\n\n5.4\n\n(5.29)\n\nThe evolution of the curvature perturbation\n\nThe simplest possibility for the origin of the observed curvature perturbation is that\nit comes from the vacuum fluctuation of the inflaton field in a single-component\nmodel (see Section 2.5). More recently other possibilities were recognised and we\nsummarise the situation now. Although the discussion is usually applied to the\nmagnitude of the curvature perturbation, it applies equally to the non-gaussianity.\n\n5.4.1\n\nHeavy, light and ultra-light fields\n\nOn each scale the initial epoch, as far as classical perturbations are concerned, should\nbe taken to be a few Hubble times after horizon exit during inflation. The reason is\nthat all such perturbations are supposed to originate from the vacuum fluctuation\nof one or more light scalar fields, the fluctuation on each scale being promoted to a\nclassical perturbation around the time of horizon exit [4, 78, 81, 122, 124].\n82\n\n\fConsidering a fixed basis with canonical normalisation, a light field is roughly\nspeaking one satisfying the flatness condition in Eq. (5.24). The terminology is\nsuggested by the important special case that the effective potential during inflation\nis quadratic. Then, a light field is roughly speaking that whose effective mass during\ninflation is less than the value H\u2217 of the Hubble parameter. More precisely, the\ncondition that the vacuum fluctuation be promoted to a classical perturbation is\n[155]\n3\nm < H\u2217 .\n(5.30)\n2\nFrom now on we focus on the quadratic potential, and take this as the the definition\nof a light field. Conversely a heavy field may be defined as one for which the condition\nin Eq. (5.30) is violated.\nDuring inflation light fields slowly roll according to Eq. (5.25) (with the vacuum\nfluctuation superimposed) while the heavy fields presumably are pinned down at an\ninstantaneous minimum of the effective potential. As we have seen, multi-component\ninflation takes place in a subspace of field space. The fields in this subspace are\nlight, but their effective masses are sufficient to appreciably curve the inflationary\ntrajectories. In the case of both multi-component and single-component inflation,\nthere could also be 'ultra-light' fields, which do not appreciably curve the inflationary\ntrajectory and which therefore have practically no effect on the dynamics of inflation.\n\n5.4.2\n\nThe evolution of the curvature perturbation\n\nTo describe the behaviour of perturbations during the super-horizon era, without\nmaking too many detailed assumptions, it is useful to invoke the separate universe\nhypothesis [12, 127, 140, 197, 222] after smoothing on a given comoving scale much\nbigger than the horizon5 . According to this hypothesis the local evolution at each\nposition is that of some unperturbed universe (separate universe). Of course the\nseparate universe hypothesis can and should be checked where there is a sufficiently\ndetailed model. However, it should be correct on cosmological scales for a very\nsimple reason. The unperturbed Universe may be defined as the one around us,\nsmoothed on a scale a bit bigger than the present Hubble distance. In other words,\nthe separate universe hypothesis is certainly valid when applied to that scale. But\nthe whole range of cosmological scales spans only a few orders of magnitude. This\nmeans that cosmological scales are likely to be huge compared with any scale that is\nrelevant in the early Universe, and accordingly that the separate universe hypothesis\nshould be valid when applied to cosmological scales even though it might fail on much\nsmaller scales (this expectation was verified in a preheating example [113] to which\nwe return later).\n5\n\nWhen considering linear equations, smoothing is equivalent to dropping short wavelengths\nfourier components. In the nonlinear situation the smoothing procedure could be in principle\nambiguous. In a given situation one should state explicitly which quantities are being smoothed.\n\n83\n\n\fWe are concerned with the curvature perturbation, which during the superhorizon era is conserved as long as the pressure is a unique function of the energy\ndensity (the adiabatic pressure condition) (see Subsection 2.2.3). The adiabatic\npressure condition will be satisfied if and only if the separate universes are identical\n(at least as far as the relation between pressure and energy density is concerned) 6 .\nThe condition to have identical universes after a given epoch is that the specification\nof a single quantity at that epoch is sufficient to determine the entire subsequent\nevolution.\nIn the case of single-component inflation, the initial condition may be supplied\nby the local value of the inflaton field, at the very beginning of the super-horizon\nera when it first becomes classical. Given the separate universe hypothesis, that is\nthe only possibility if the inflaton is the only light field ever to play a significant\ndynamical role. This means that the curvature perturbation generated at horizon exit\nduring single-component inflation will be equal to the one observed at the approach\nof horizon entry, provided that the inflaton is the only light field ever to play a\ndynamical role.\nIf inflation is multi-component, more than one field is by definition relevant\nduring inflation. Then the curvature perturbation cannot be conserved during inflation. The variation of the curvature perturbation during multi-component inflation\nis caused by the vacuum fluctuation orthogonal to the unperturbed inflationary trajectory, which around the time of horizon exit kicks the trajectory onto a nearby\none so that the local trajectory becomes position-dependent. After inflation is over,\nthe curvature perturbation will be conserved if the local trajectories lead to practically identical universes. In other words it will be conserved if the light (and\nultra-light) fields, orthogonal to the trajectory at the end of inflation, do not affect\nthe subsequent evolution of the Universe.\nThe curvature perturbation after inflation will vary if some light or ultra-light\nfield, orthogonal to the trajectory at the end of inflation, affects the subsequent\nevolution of the Universe (to be precise, affects the pressure) [23, 77]. As we shall\ndescribe in Section 5.7, three types of scenario have been proposed for this postinflationary variation of the curvature perturbation.\n\n5.5\n5.5.1\n\nNon-gaussianity\nDefining the non-gaussianity\n\nA gaussian perturbation is one whose Fourier components are uncorrelated [166]. All\nof its statistical properties are defined by its spectrum, and the spectrum Pg (k) \u2261\n6\n\nOf course the identity will only hold after making an appropriate synchronization of the clocks\nat different positions. Having made that synchronization, horizon entry will occur at different\ntimes in different positions, which can be regarded as the origin of the curvature perturbation.\n\n84\n\n\fA2g (k/aHinf )ng of generic perturbation is conveniently defined [112, 130] by7\nhgk1 gk2 i =\n\n2\u03c0 2 3\n\u03b4 (k1 + k2 )Pg (k) ,\nk3\n\n(5.31)\n\nthe normalisation being chosen so that\nhg 2 (x)i =\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\n0\n\nPg (k)\n\ndk\n.\nk\n\n(5.32)\n\nOn cosmological scales a few Hubble times before horizon entry, observation shows\nthat the curvature perturbation is almost Gaussian with |A\u03b6 | \u2248 5 \u00d7 10\u22125 [207].\nThe simplest kind of non-gaussianity that the curvature perturbation could possess is of the form\n\u0010\n\u0011\n3\n\u03b6(x) = \u03b6g (x) \u2212 fNL \u03b6g2 (x) \u2212 h\u03b6g2i ,\n5\n\n(5.33)\n\nwhere \u03b6g is Gaussian with h\u03b6g i = 0, and the non-linearity parameter fNL is independent of position. We will call this correlated \u03c72 non-gaussianity. Note that this\ndefinition assumes that h\u03b6i = 0, which means that the zero Fourier mode (spatial\naverage) is dropped.\nFollowing Maldacena [142], we have inserted the prefactor \u2212(3/5) so that in\nfirst-order perturbation theory our definition agrees with that of Komatsu and\nSpergel [103], which is generally the definition people use when comparing theory\nwith observation. Working\nin first-order\nperturbation theory, these authors write\n\u0010\n\u0011\n2\n2\n\u03a6(x) = \u03a6g (x) + fNL \u03a6g (x) \u2212 h\u03a6g i , and their \u03a6 is equal to \u22123/5 times our \u03b6 8 .\nOne of the most powerful observational signatures of non-gaussianity is a nonzero\nvalue for the three-point correlator, specified by the bispectrum B defined by [14,\n103]\nh\u03b6k1 \u03b6k2 \u03b6k3 i = (2\u03c0)\u22123/2 B(k1 , k2 , k3 )\u03b4 3 (k1 + k2 + k3 ) .\n(5.35)\nFor correlated \u03c72 non-gaussianity (with the gaussian term dominating)\n\n7\n\nh\ni\n6\nB(k1 , k2 , k3 ) = \u2212 fNL P\u03b6 (k1 )P\u03b6 (k2 ) + cyclic permutations ,\n5\n\n(5.36)\n\nTechnically the expectation values in this and the following expressions refer to an ensemble of\nuniverses but, because the stochastic properties of the perturbations are supposed to be invariant\nunder translations, the expectation values can also be regarded as averages over the location of the\nobserver who defines the origin of coordinates.\n8\nT\nThe actual quantity constrained by observational data is fNL\n, which is the non-linearity parameter for the CMB temperature anisotropies:\n\"\u0012 \u0013\n*\u0012 \u0013 +#\n\u0012 \u0013\n2\n2\n\u03b4T\n\u03b4T\n\u03b4T\n\u03b4T\nT\n(x) + fNL\n.\n(5.34)\n(x) =\n(x) \u2212\nT\nT g\nT g\nT g\nT\nAt first order fNL\n= 3fNL because \u03b4T /T0 = (\u22121/5)\u03b6 [c.f. Eqs. (1.1) and (1.2)]. However, to\nT\nin terms of fNL\ncompare adequately the observational data with our fNL , we must calculate fNL\nat second order (see e.g. Refs. [16, 18, 19, 20, 45]).\n\n85\n\n\fwhere P\u03b6 (k) = 2\u03c0 2 P\u03b6 (k)/k 3 . For any kind of non-Gaussianity one may use the above\nexpression to define a function fNL (k1 , k2 , k3 ).\nGiven a calculation of fNL using first-order perturbation theory, one expects in\ngeneral that going to second order will change fNL by an amount of order 1. On this\nbasis, one expects that a first-order calculation is good enough if it yields |fNL | \u226b 1,\nbut that otherwise a second-order calculation will be necessary.\nThe definition Eq. (5.36) of fNL is made using our adopted definition of \u03b6. If \u03b6\nin the definition is replaced by \u03b6 MW (with the zero Fourier mode dropped) then fNL\nshould be replaced by\n5\nMW\nfNL\n\u2261 fNL \u2212 .\n(5.37)\n3\nTo obtain this expression we used Eq. (5.7) and dropped terms higher than second\norder9 .\nAll of this assumes that the non-gaussian component of \u03b6 is fully correlated with\nthe gaussian component. An alternative possibility [32] that will be important for\nus is if \u03b6 has the form\n\u0010\n\u0011\n3\n\u03b6(x) = \u03b6g (x) \u2212 f \u0303NL \u03b6\u03b82 (x) \u2212 h\u03b6\u03b82i ,\n5\n\n(5.38)\n\nwhere \u03b6g and \u03b6\u03b8 are uncorrelated Gaussian perturbations, normalised to have equal\nspectra, and the parameter f \u0303NL is independent of position. We will call this uncorrelated \u03c72 non-gaussianity. It can be shown [32] that in this case, fNL as defined by\nEq. (5.36) is given by\n!3\nf \u0303NL\n.\n(5.39)\nfNL \u223c\n653\n\n5.5.2\n\nObservational constraints on the non-gaussianity\n\nTaking fNL to denote the non-linearity parameter at the primordial era, let us consider the observational constraints. Detailed calculations have so far been made\nonly with fNL independent of the wavenumbers, and only by using first-order perturbation theory for the evolution of the cosmological perturbations after horizon\nentry. It is found [102] that present observation requires |fNL| <\n102 making the\n\u223c\nnon-gaussian fraction at most of order 10\u22123. The use of first-order perturbation\ntheory in this context is amply justified. Looking to the future though, it is found\nthat the PLANCK satellite will either detect non-gaussianity or reduce the bound\n< 5 [14, 103], and that foreseeable future observations can reach a level\nto |fNL | \u223c\n|fNL | \u223c 3 [14, 103].\nAlthough the use of first-order perturbation theory is not really justified for the\nlatter estimates, we can safely conclude that it will be difficult for observation ever\nto detect a value |fNL | \u226a 1. That is a pity because, as we shall see, such a value is\n9\n\nT\nObviously the parameter fNL\n, which is the important one to make comparison with observational data, does not depend on the chosen definition for fNL .\n\n86\n\n\fpredicted by some theoretical scenarios. On the other hand, other scenarios predict\n|fNL | roughly of order 1. It will therefore be of great interest to have detailed secondorder calculations, to establish precisely the level of sensitivity that can be achieved\nby future observations. A step in this direction has been taken in Ref. [20] (see\nalso Refs. [16, 18, 19, 45]), where a non-linear expression for the large-scale CMB\nanisotropy is given in terms of only the curvature perturbation (generalizing the\nfirst-order Sachs-Wolfe effect [191]).\n\n5.6\n5.6.1\n\nThe initial non-gaussianity\nSingle-component inflation\n\nAt first order, the curvature perturbation during single-component inflation is Gaussian. The amplitude of its time-independent spectrum is given by [112, 130] [c.f.\nEq.

Eq. (2.127)]:\nrT \u03b6 = 16\u03b5 .\n\n(5.42)\n\nIf the curvature perturbation does not evolve after single-component inflation is\nover observation constrains n\u03b6 and rT \u03b6 , and hence the slow-roll parameters \u03b7\u03c6 and\n\u03b5. A current bound [207] is \u22120.048 < n\u03b6 < 0.016 and rT \u03b6 < 0.46. The second bound\n< 0.003.\ngives \u03b5 < 0.029, but barring an accurate cancellation the first bound gives \u03b5 \u223c\nIn most inflation models \u03b5 is completely negligible and then the first bound gives\n\u22120.024 < \u03b7\u03c6 < 0.008 (irrespective of slow-roll inflation models, the upper bound in\nthis expression holds generally, and the lower bound is badly violated only if there\nis an accurate cancellation). The bottom line of all this is that \u03b5 and |\u03b7\u03c6 | are both\n< 10\u22122 .\nconstrained to be \u223c\nGoing to second order, Maldacena [142] has calculated the bispectrum during\nsingle-component inflation (see also Refs. [38, 43, 69, 74, 181, 194, 199]) 10 . His\n10\n\nIn Ref. [181] (see also Ref. [180]) Rigopoulos et. al. calculated the three-point correlator in\nsingle-component slow-roll inflation using a stochastic approach. Their result agrees with Maldacena's in the squeezed limit (where one of the scales k \u22121 crosses the horizon much earlier than\nthe other two, k1 \u226a k2 , k3 ), but disagrees in the limit where the ~ki 's form an equilateral triangle.\nCalcagni in Ref. [38] extended this stochastic approach to calculate the non-gaussianity originated\nfrom a Dirac-Born-Infeld tachyonic inflaton and in braneworld scenarios, finding results identical\nto Maldacena's one. The three-point correlators calculated for both cases were found identical to\nthat calculated in Ref. [181].\n\n87\n\n\fresult may be written in the form\nfNL =\n\n5\n[2\u03b7\u03c6 \u2212 6\u03b5 \u2212 2\u03b5f (k1, k2 , k3 )] ,\n12\n\n(5.43)\n\nwith 0 \u2264 f \u2264 5/6. By virtue of the slow-roll conditions, |fNL | \u226a 1 11 . In other\nwords, the curvature perturbation \u03b6, as we have defined it, is almost Gaussian during\nsingle-component inflation.\nFrom Eq. (5.29) \u03b6 A is also practically gaussian, but this quantity is defined\nonly during inflation and therefore could not be considered as a replacement for \u03b6.\nMore importantly, \u03b6 MW has significant non-gaussianity because, from Eq. (5.37), it\nMW\ncorresponds to fNL\n\u2248 \u22125/3.\nOne may ask why it is our \u03b6 and not \u03b6 MW which is gaussian in the slow-roll limit.\nOne feature that distinguishes our \u03b6, is that any part of it can be absorbed into the\nscale factor without altering the rest; indeed\ngij = \u03b4ij a2 (\u03b7)e2\u03b61 +\u03b62 = \u03b4ij \u00e32 (\u03b7)e\u03b62 ,\n\n(5.44)\n\nwith \u00e3 = ae\u03b61 (if we tried to do that with \u03b6MW , the part of \u03b6 not absorbed would have\nto be re-scaled). This means that an extremely long-wavelength and possible large\npart of \u03b6 has no local significance. It also means, in the context of perturbation\ntheory, that the first-order part of \u03b6 can be absorbed into the scale factor when\ndiscussing the second-order part. However, the gaussianity of \u03b6 does not seem to be\nrelated directly to this feature. Rather, it has to do with the gauge transformation,\nrelating quantities \u03c8A and \u03c8B defined on different slicings.\nWith our definition [127], the gauge transformation is\n\u03c8A (t, x) \u2212 \u03c8B (t, x) = \u2212\u2206NAB (t, x),\n\n(5.45)\n\nwhere \u2206NAB is the number of e-folds of expansion going from a slice B to a slice A,\nboth of them corresponding to time t 12 . In writing this expression we used physical\ntime t instead of conformal time, the two related by dt = ad\u03b7. Along\na comoving\nR\nworldline, the number of e-folds of expansion is defined as N \u2261 H\u0303d\u03c4 where H\u0303 is\nthe local Hubble parameter and d\u03c4 is the proper time interval [127].\nTo understand the relevance of this result, take \u03c8B = 0 and \u03c8A = \u2212\u03b6. The\npressure is adiabatic during single-component inflation, which means that dt can be\n11\n\nNear a maximum of the potential 'fast-roll' inflation [31, 115] can take place with |\u03b7\u03c6 | somewhat\nbigger than 1. Maldacena's calculation does not apply to that case but, presumably, it gives initial\nnon-gaussianity |fNL | \u223c 1. Although the corresponding initial spectral index is far from 1, which\nmeans that the initial curvature perturbation produced by \u03c6 must be negligible, the precise initial\nvalue of fNL may in this case be important as long as another field (like the curvaton) be in charge\nof generating the observed curvature perturbation.\n12\nThis expression is valid even when the tensor perturbation is included [127]. As a result, the\ngauge-invariant expressions mentioned earlier are still valid in that case, as are the results based\non them including the present discussion.\n\n88\n\n\fidentified with the proper time interval d\u03c4 , and the proper expansion rate on slicing\nA is uniform [127]. As a result, to second order,\n1\n\u03b6 = Hinf (t)\u2206t(t, x) + \u1e22inf (t) (\u2206t(t, x))2\n2\n1 \u1e22inf\n\u2243 Hinf \u2206t(t, x) +\n(Hinf \u2206t(t, x))2\n2\n2 Hinf\n\u2243 Hinf \u2206t(t, x) .\n\n(5.46)\n\nIn the last line we made the slow-roll approximation, and from the second line we\ncan see that the error in fNL caused by this approximation is precisely \u03b5.\nWe also need the gauge transformation for the inflaton field \u03c6 in terms of \u2206t.\nSince the slices correspond to the same coordinate time, the unperturbed inflaton\nfield can be taken to be the same on each of them which means that the gauge\ntransformation for \u03b4\u03c6 is\n\u03b4\u03c6A (t, x) \u2212 \u03b4\u03c6B (t, x) = \u2206\u03c6AB (t, x),\n\n(5.47)\n\nwhere \u2206\u03c6AB is the change in \u03c6 going from slice B to slice A. But slice A corresponds\nto uniform \u03c6, which means that on slice B to second order\nHinf (t)\n\n\u03b4\u03c6B (t, x)\n1\n\u03c6\u03080\n= \u2212Hinf (t)\u2206t(t, x) \u2212 Hinf (t) (\u2206t(t, x))2\n\u03c6\u03070\n2\n\u03c6\u03070\n1 \u03c6\u03080\n(Hinf \u2206t(t, x))2\n\u2243 \u2212Hinf \u2206t(t, x) \u2212\n2 Hinf \u03c6\u03070\n\u2243 \u2212Hinf \u2206t(t, x) ,\n\n(5.48)\n\nwhere in the last line we used the slow-roll approximation. We can see that the\nfractional error caused by this approximation is \u03c6\u03080 /Hinf \u03c6\u03070 = \u03b5 \u2212 \u03b7\u03c6 .\nCombining Eqs. (5.46) and (5.48) we have in the slow-roll approximation\n\u03b6 \u2243 \u2212Hinf (t)\n\n\u03b4\u03c6B (t, x)\n,\n\u03c6\u03070\n\n(5.49)\n\nwith fractional error of order max{\u03b7\u03c6 , \u03b5} (this can also be seen directly from Eqs. (5.20)\nand (5.22) evaluated with \u03c8 = 0, but we give the above argument because it explains\nwhy the result is valid for \u03b6 as opposed to \u03b6 MW ).\nThe final and crucial step is to observe that in the slow-roll approximation \u03c6B is\ngaussian, with again a fractional error of order max{\u03b7\u03c6 , \u03b5}. This was demonstrated\nby Maldacena [142] but the basic reason is very simple. The non-gaussianity of\n\u03c6 comes either from third and higher derivatives of V (through the field equation\nin unperturbed spacetime) or else through the back-reaction (the perturbation of\nspacetime); but the first effect is small [112, 130] by virtue of the flatness require2\nments on the potential, and the second effect is small because \u03c6\u03070 /Hinf\nis small [112].\nThis explains why \u03b6 with our adopted definition is practically Gaussian by virtue of\nthe slow-roll approximation.\n89\n\n\f5.6.2\n\nMulti-component inflation\n\nThe flatness and slow-roll conditions Eqs. (5.23), (5.24), and (5.25) ensure that\nthe curvature of the inflationary trajectories is small during the few Hubble times\naround horizon exit, during which the quantum fluctuation is promoted to a classical\nperturbation. As a result, the initial curvature perturbation in first-order perturbation theory is still given by the amplitude in Eq. (5.40) and the spectral index in\nEq. (5.41) in terms of the field \u03c6 that we defined earlier.\nWhat about the initial non-gaussianity generated at second order? In the approximation that the curvature of the trajectories around horizon exit is completely negligible, we can safely say that the initial non-gaussianity corresponds to |fNL | \u226a 1.\nConfirming this expectation, Seery and Lidsey [200] have calculated the three-point\ncorrelator of the perturbations in the fields involved in multi-component slow-roll\ninflation.

From its definition Eq. (5.7), the same is true of \u03b6 MW .\nIn contrast \u03b62A , given by Eq. (5.29), will have the slow variation [217]\n\n13\n\n\u03b6\u03072A \u2248 \u2212(2\u03b5\u0307 \u2212 \u03b7\u0307\u03c6 )(\u03b61 )2 .\n\n(5.53)\n\nThe cyclic permutations in k and \u03c6 in Eq. (5.52) must be simultaneous, i.e. when exchanging\nindices i and j, for example, k1 and k2 must also be exchanged. Notice also that the calculation\nof Seery and Lidsey's is only valid when the magnitudes of the three wavevectors are roughly\ncomparable, so that they exit the horizon at similar epochs.\n\n90\n\n\fThis variation has no physical significance, being an artifact of the definition.\nUsing a particular gauge, Acquaviva et. al. [3] have calculated \u03b6\u03072A in terms of\nfirst-order quantities \u03c81 , \u03b4\u03c61 , and their derivatives, and they have displayed the\nresult as an indefinite integral\n\u03b62A (t)\n\n=\n\nZ\n\nt\n\nA(t)dt + B(t) .\n\n(5.54)\n\nInserting an initial condition, valid a few Hubble times after horizon exit, this becomes\nZ t\nA\nA\n(5.55)\nA(t)dt + B|ttini .\n\u03b62 (t) = \u03b62 (tini ) +\ntini\n\nIn view of our discussion, it is clear that these equations will, if correctly evaluated,\njust reproduce the time dependence of Eq. (5.53).\nThe authors of Ref. [3] also present the respective equation for \u03b6\u03072A , involving\nonly first-order quantities, which is valid also before horizon entry. Contrary to the\nclaim of the authors, this classical equation cannot by itself be used to calculate the\ninitial value (more precisely, the stochastic properties of the initial value) of \u03b62A . In\nparticular, it cannot by itself reproduce Maldacena's calculation of the bispectrum.\nIt is true of course that in the Heisenberg picture the quantum operators satisfy\nthe classical field equations. In first-order perturbation theory, where the equations\nare linear, this allows one to calculate the curvature perturbation without going\nto the trouble of calculating the second-order action [112] (at the nth order of\nperturbation theory the action has to be evaluated to order n + 1 if it is to be used).\nAt second order in perturbation theory it remains to be seen whether the Heisenberg\npicture can provide a useful alternative to Maldacena's calculation, who adopted the\ninteraction picture and calculated the action to third order.\n\n5.7.2\n\nMulti-component inflation\n\nDuring multi-component inflation the curvature perturbation by definition varies\nsignificantly along a generic trajectory, which means that non-gaussianity is generated at some level. So far only a limited range of models has been investigated\n[15, 28, 29, 62, 67, 157, 192]. To keep the spectral tilt within observational bounds,\nthe unperturbed trajectory in these models has to be specially chosen, but the choice\nmight be justified by a suitable initial condition.\nWe shall consider here a calculation by Enqvist and V\u00e4ihk\u00f6nen in Refs. [67, 131,\n214]. Following the same line as Acquaviva et. al. [3], they study a two-component\ninflation model, in which the only important parts of the potential are\n1\n1\nV (\u03c6, \u03b8) = Vh + m2\u03b8 \u03b82 + m2\u03c6 \u03c62 .\n2\n2\n\n(5.56)\n\nThe masses are both supposed to be less than (3/2)H\u2217, so that this is a twocomponent inflation model, and the above form of the potential is supposed to\n91\n\n\fhold for some number \u2206N of e-folds after cosmological scales leave the horizon.\nThey take the unperturbed inflation trajectory to have \u03b80 = 0, and the idea is to\ncalculate the amount of non-gaussianity generated after \u2206N e-folds. Irrespective\nof any later evolution, this calculated non-gaussianity will represent the minimal\nobserved one (unless non-gaussianity generated later happens to cancel it).\nIt is supposed that the condition \u03b80 = 0, as well as the ending of inflation, will\ncome from a tree-level hybrid potential,\n1\n1\n1\n1\nV (\u03c6, \u03b8) = Vh \u2212 m2\u03b8 \u03b82 + \u03bb\u03b84 + m2\u03c6 \u03c62 + g 2 \u03b82 \u03c62 .\n(5.57)\n2\n4\n2\n2\nLike the original authors though, we shall not investigate the extent to which\nEq. (5.57) can reproduce Eq. (5.56) for at least some number of e-folds. We just\nfocus on Eq. (5.56), with the assumption \u03b80 = 0 for the unperturbed trajectory.\nBecause \u03b80 = 0, the unperturbed trajectory is straight, and at first order the\ncurvature perturbation \u03b6 is conserved. This is not the case though at second order.\nAdopting the definition \u03b6 A , the authors of Ref. [67] give an expression for \u03b62A similar\nto that in Eq. (5.55) describing the evolution of the second-order curvature perturbation on superhorizon scales14 . This equation, in the generalized longitudinal\ngauge, reads (from Eq. (67) in Ref.

Therefore,\nthe overall slow-roll factors give the actual magnitude. We have to remember that,\n93\n\n\fin this case, the right hand side is uncorrelated with the inflaton perturbation \u03b4\u03c6\nwhich generates \u03b61A . Thus, Eq. (5.38) as opposed to Eq. (5.33) applies, and the associated fNL would be \u223c 10\u22129 O(\u03b53 , \u03b7\u03c63 , \u03b7\u03b83 ), which is extremely small. If the observed\n\u03b6 has a non-gaussian part \u03b62A equal to Eq. (5.68) and a gaussian part generated\nmostly after inflation, one can obtain |fNL | > 1 by choosing \u03b7\u03c6 > 0.26, \u03b7\u03b8 = \u03b7\u03c6 /2,\nN = 70, and \u03b62A = 10\u22122 \u03b6.\nAs we will see in the next chapter, where the Enqvist and V\u00e4ihk\u00f6nen model is\nstudied by means of the non perturbative \u03b4N formalism (see Subsection 6.5.3), the\nexpression in Eq. (5.68) disagrees with the one calculated using the \u03b4N formalism\nthrough the appearance of non-local terms [132, 133], though the order of magnitude\nis similar [214]. We point out that the possible source of discrepancy is the use of a set\nof cosmological perturbation theory equations in Ref. [67] based on those presented\nin Ref. [3]. A calculation made with another set of cosmological perturbation\ntheory equations that do not involve non-local terms [144] reproduces exactly the\nresult found using the \u03b4N formalism (see Subsection 6.5.3).\n\n5.7.3\n\nPreheating\n\nNow we turn to the possibility that significant non-gaussianity could be generated\nduring preheating. Preheating is a stage of non-perturbative explosive resonant decay of scalar fields which might occur between the end of inflation and reheating\n[23, 98, 99, 212], the latter being taken to correspond to the decay of individual particles which leads to more or less complete thermalisation of the Universe. Preheating\ntypically produces marginally-relativistic particles, which decay before reheating.\nIt was suggested a long time ago [21, 22] that preheating might cause the cosmological curvature perturbation to vary at the level of first-order perturbation theory,\nperhaps providing its main origin. More recently it has been suggested [60, 61, 62]\nthat preheating might cause the curvature perturbation to vary at second order,\nproviding the main source of its non-gaussianity.\nIf the separate universe hypothesis is correct, a variation of the curvature perturbation during preheating can occur only in models of preheating which contain\na non-inflaton field that is light during inflation. This is not the case for the usual\npreheating models that were considered in [60, 61, 62], and accordingly one does not\nexpect that significant non-gaussianity will be generated in those models15 . This is\nnot in conflict with the findings of [60, 61, 62] because the curvature perturbation\nis not actually considered there. Instead the perturbation \u03c8 MW in the longitudinal gauge is considered, which is only indirectly related to \u03b6 by Eqs. (5.7), (5.11)\nand (5.12) 16 . We conjecture that non-gaussianity for the curvature perturbation\non cosmological scales is not generated in the usual preheating models, but that\n15\n\nThe preheating model considered in [62] contains a field which may be heavy or light; we refer\nhere to the part of the calculation that considers the former case.\n16\nThe slices of the longitudinal gauge are orthogonal to the threads of zero shear, and \u03c8 MW on\nthem is very different from the curvature perturbation \u03b6.\n\n94\n\n\finstead the curvature perturbation remains constant on cosmological scales. This\nshould of course be checked, in the same spirit that the constancy of the curvature\nperturbation was checked at the first-order level [113].\nThe situation is different for preheating models which contain a non-inflaton field\nthat is light during inflation. At least three types of models have been proposed with\nthat feature [8, 24, 25, 62, 100]. Except for [62] only the magnitude of the curvature\nperturbation has been considered, but in all three cases it might be that significant\nnon-gaussianity is also generated.\n\n5.7.4\n\nThe curvaton scenario\n\nIn the simplest version of the curvaton scenario [138, 139, 159] (see Subsection\n2.4.2), the curvaton field \u03c3 is ultra-light during inflation, weakly coupled, and has\nno significant evolution until it starts to oscillate during some radiation-dominated\nera. Until this oscillation gets under way, the curvature perturbation is supposed\nto be negligible (compared with its final observed value). The potential during the\noscillation is taken to be quadratic, which will be a good approximation after a few\nHubble times even if it fails initially. The curvature perturbation is generated during\nthe oscillation, and is supposed to be conserved after the curvaton decays. Here\nwe give a generally-valid formula for the non-gaussianity in the curvaton scenario,\nextending somewhat the earlier calculations.\nThe local energy density \u03c1\u03c3 of the curvaton field is given by [c.f. Eq. (2.53)]\n1\n\u03c1\u03c3 (\u03b7, x) \u2248 m2\u03c3 \u03c3a2 (\u03b7, x) ,\n(5.69)\n2\nwhere \u03c3a (\u03b7, x) represents the amplitude of the oscillations and m\u03c3 is the effective\nmass. It is proportional to a(\u03b7, x)\u22123 where a is the locally-defined scale factor.\nThis means that the perturbation \u03b4\u03c1\u03c3 /\u03c1\u03c30 is conserved if the slicing is chosen so\nthat the expansion going from one slicing to the next is uniform [140]. The flat\nslicing corresponding to \u03c8 MW = 0 has this property [127, 140] and accordingly \u03b4\u03c1\u03c3\nis defined on that slicing (see Subsection 2.4.2).\nAssuming that the fractional perturbation is small (which we shall see is demanded by observation) it is given by\n\u03b4\u03c1\u03c3\n\u03b4\u03c3a\n\u03b4\u03c3a\n\u22482\n+\n\u03c1\u03c30\n\u03c3a0\n\u03c3a0\n\n!2\n\n,\n\n(5.70)\n\nwhere we have extended to second order the Eq. (2.65). We first assume that \u03c3(x)\nhas no evolution between inflation and the onset of oscillation. Then \u03b4\u03c3a /\u03c3a0 will\nbe equal to its value just after horizon exit, which we saw earlier will be practically\ngaussian.\nThe total density perturbation is given by\n\u03b4\u03c1\n\u03c10\n\n!\n\ntotal\n\n\u2248\u03a9\n\n95\n\n\u03b4\u03c1\u03c3\n,\n\u03c1\u03c30\n\n(5.71)\n\n\fwhere \u03a9 \u2261 \u03c1\u03c30 /\u03c1total0 \u221d a is the fraction of energy density contributed by the\ncurvaton. Adopting the sudden-decay approximation, the constant curvature perturbation obtaining after the curvaton decays is given by Eqs. (5.11) and (5.13),\nevaluated just before curvaton decay and with \u03c8 = 0. In performing that calculation, the exact expression Eq. (5.70) can, without loss of generality, be identified\nwith the first-order part \u03b4\u03c1\u03c31 /\u03c1\u03c30 , the second- and higher-order parts being set at\nzero.\nAdopting the first-order curvature perturbation in Eq. (5.11), one finds [138] \u03c72\nnon-gaussianity coming from the second term of Eq. (5.70),\nfNL = \u2212\n\n5\n,\n4r\n\n(5.72)\n\nwith\n\n3\u03c1\u03c30\n,\n(5.73)\n4\u03c1r0 + 3\u03c1\u03c30\nevaluated just before decay. Going to the second-order expression one finds [17]\nMW\nadditional \u03c72 non-gaussianity. The final non-linearity parameter fNL = fNL\n+ 5/3\nis given by\n5 5\n5\n.\n(5.74)\nfN L = + r \u2212\n3 6\n4r\nIf \u03a9 just before the curvaton decay (\u03a9dec ) is much less than 1 (\u03a9dec \u226a 1) then\n> 0.01 (combined\nfNL is strongly negative and the present bound on it requires \u03a9dec \u223c\n\u22125\nwith the typical value |A\u03b6 | \u2248 5 \u00d7 10 , this requires \u03b4\u03c1\u03c3 /\u03c1\u03c30 \u226a 1 as advertised). If\ninstead \u03a9dec = 1 to good accuracy, then fNL = +5/4. Either of these possibilities\nmay be regarded as generic whereas the intermediate possibility (|fNL| \u223c 1 but\nfNL 6= 5/4) requires a special value of \u03a9dec just a bit less than 1.\nFinally, we consider the case that \u03c3 evolves between horizon exit and the era\nwhen the sinusoidal oscillation begins. If \u03c3a (the amplitude of oscillation at the\nlatter era) is some function g(\u03c3\u2217 ) of the value a few Hubble times after horizon exit,\nthen\n1\n(5.75)\n\u03b4\u03c3a = g \u2032 \u03b4\u03c3\u2217 + g \u2032\u2032(\u03b4\u03c3\u2217 )2 ,\n2\nwhere the prime means derivative with respect to \u03c3\u2217 . Repeating the above calculation one finds\n!\ngg \u2032\u2032\n5\n5 5\n1 + \u20322 .\n(5.76)\nfNL = + r \u2212\n3 6\n4r\ng\nr\u2261\n\nThe final term is the first-order result (given originally in [126]), the middle term is\nMW\nthe second-order correction found in [17], and the first term converts from fNL\nto\nfNL .\n\n5.7.5\n\nThe inhomogeneous reheating scenario\n\nThe final scenario that has been suggested for the origin of the curvature perturbation is its generation during some spatially inhomogeneous reheating process\n96\n\n\f[53, 54, 97] (see also Refs. [65, 148, 150, 151, 216, 224]). Before a reheating process\nthe cosmic fluid is dominated by matter (non-relativistic particles, or small scalar\nfield oscillations which are equivalent to particles) which then decay into thermalised\nradiation. At least one reheating process, presumably, has to occur to give the initial\ncondition for Big Bang Nucleosynthesis, but there might be more than one.\nThe inhomogeneous reheating scenario in its simplest form supposes that the\ncurvature perturbation is negligible before the relevant reheating process, and constant afterwards. The inhomogeneous reheating corresponds to spatial fluctuations\nin the decay rate of the inflaton field to ordinary matter, which lead to fluctuations\nin the reheating temperature. The coupling of the inflaton to normal matter is determined by the vacuum expectation values of scalar fields in the theory. If those\nfields are light they will fluctuate leading to density perturbations through the described mechanism. Inhomogeneities in the inflaton decay rate lead to a a spatially\nvarying value (a perturbation) of the local Hubble parameter Hreh (x) at the decay\nepoch (or equivalently of the local energy density).\nIn contrast with the curvaton scenario, where the form \u03c1\u03c3 can reasonably be taken\nas \u03c1\u03c3 \u221d \u03c3 2 , the inhomogeneous reheating scenario does not suggest any particular\nform for Hreh (\u03c7). Depending on the form, the inhomogeneous reheating scenario\npresumably can produce a wide range of values for fNL [216, 224].\n\n5.8\n\nConclusions\n\nWe have examined a number of scenarios for the production of a non-gaussian primordial curvature perturbation, presenting the results with a unified notation [131].\nThese are the single-component inflation, multi-component inflation, preheating,\ncurvaton, and inhomogeneous reheating scenarios. Although the trispectrum may\ngive a competitive observational signal [32, 88, 164, 215], we have focused only on\nthe bispectrum which is characterised by the parameter fNL . In all cases our treatment is based on existing ones, though we do not always agree with the original\nauthors.\nTable 5.1: Non-gaussianity according to different scenarios for the creation of the\ncurvature perturbation. For the simplest curvaton scenario, fNL = +5/4 is a\nfavoured value.\nScenario\nSingle-component inflation\nMulti-component inflation\nSimplest curvaton scenario\n\n|fNL | \u226a 1\nyes\nlikely\nunlikely\n\n|fNL | \u2243 1\nno\npossible\nlikely\n\nfNL \u226a \u22121\nno\npossible\nlikely\n\nfNL \u226b 1\nno\npossible\nno\n\nThe preheating and inhomogeneous reheating scenarios cover a range of possibilities, which have not been fully explored but which can presumably allow a\n97\n\n\fwide range for fNL . The same is true of multi-component inflation, except that\n2\nextremely large values comparable with the current bound |fNL| <\n\u223c 10 seem relatively unlikely. In contrast, the simplest curvaton scenario can produce a strongly\nnegative value (even violating the current bound). However, in the important special case where the curvaton dominates the energy density before it decays, it gives\nprecisely fNL = +5/4. Finally, for the single-component inflation case, Maldacena's\ncalculation combined with current constraints on the spectral tilt show that it has\nmagnitude less than 10\u22122 . These result are summarised in the Table 5.1.\nIn the near future, results from WMAP [223] or elsewhere may detect a value\n|fNL | \u226b 1. If that does not happen, then PLANCK [171] or a successor will either\n< 1. The precise level at which this\ndetect a value |fNL | \u223c 1, or place a bound |fNL | \u223c\nwill be possible has yet to be determined because it would require a second-order\ncalculation of all relevant observational signatures. The example of the simplest curvaton scenario, where fNL = +5/4 is a favoured value, shows that such a calculation\nand the eventual observations will be well worthwhile.\n\n98\n\n\fChapter 6\nThe inflationary prediction for\nprimordial non-gaussianity\n6.1\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn this chapter we present for the first time a powerful method to calculate the normalisation fNL of the bispectrum in slow-roll inflation, by means of the knowledge\nof the evolution of a family of unperturbed universes [132]. The wavevector dependence of fNL will be, in general, negligible [141, 200] compared with the (possibly\nbig) contribution coming from the evolution of the unperturbed universes. This\nmethod will be applied to selected examples. In particular we will see how the level\nof non-gaussianity in the curvaton scenario (see Subsection 5.7.4) and the second\norder curvature perturbation in the hybrid model of Enqvist and V\u00e4ihk\u00f6nen [144]\nare successfully reproduced.\nThe primordial curvature perturbation of the Universe, is already present a few\nHubble times before cosmological scales start to enter the horizon [112, 130]. Its\ntime-independent value at that stage seems to set the initial condition for the subsequent evolution of all cosmological perturbations. As a result, observation probes\nthe stochastic properties of \u03b6, which is found to be almost gaussian with an almost\nscale-invariant spectrum.\nAccording to present ideas \u03b6 is supposed to originate from the vacuum fluctuations during inflation of one or more light scalar fields, which on each scale are promoted to classical perturbations around the time of horizon exit [4, 78, 81, 122, 124].\nOne takes inflation to be almost exponential (quasi de Sitter spacetime) corresponding to a practically constant Hubble parameter Hinf , and the effective masses of the\nfields to be much less than H\u2217 . This ensures that the fields are almost massless and\nlive in almost unperturbed quasi de Sitter spacetime, making their perturbations\nindeed almost gaussian and scale invariant (see Subsections 2.4.1 and 2.5.2). This\nautomatically makes \u03b6 almost scale invariant, (see Subsections 2.4.2 and 2.5.3) and\ncan (though not automatically [131, 138]) make it also almost gaussian.\nAll of this is of intense interest at the present time, because observation over\n99\n\n\fthe next few years will rule out most existing scenarios for the generation of \u03b6, by\ndetecting or bounding the scale dependence and non-gaussianity of \u03b6. We will now\ndescribe a general procedure for calculating the level of non-gaussianity, by means\nof the \u03b4N formalism [127, 196] (see also Refs. [110, 210, 211]).\n\n6.2\n\nDefining the curvature perturbation\n\nPerturbations of the observable Universe are defined with respect to an unperturbed\nreference universe, which is homogeneous and isotropic (a FRW universe) (see Section 2.2). Its line element may be written as\nds2 = \u2212dt2 + a2 (t)\u03b4ij dxi dxj ,\n\n(6.1)\n\ndefining the unperturbed scale factor a(t), time t, and the Cartesian spatial coordinates x.\nThe curvature perturbation is only of interest after the universe has been smoothed\non some scale (k/a)\u22121 much bigger than the horizon H \u22121 . To define it, one takes the\nfixed-t slices of spacetime to have uniform energy density, and the fixed-x worldlines\nto be comoving. The spatial metric is [38, 43, 44, 127, 131, 142, 181, 183, 193, 199,\n200] [c.f. Eq. (5.3)]\ngij = a2 (t)e2\u03b6(t,x) \u03b3ij (t, x) = \u00e32 (t, x)\u03b3ij (t, x) .\n\n(6.2)\n\nIn this expression, \u03b3ij (t, x) has unit determinant, so that a volume of the Universe\nbounded by fixed comoving spatial coordinates is proportional to the locally defined\nscale factor \u00e33 (t, x). In the inflationary scenario the factor \u03b3ij just accounts for\nthe tensor perturbation, but its form is irrelevant here (see Subsections 5.2.2 and\n5.6.1). According to this definition, \u03b6 is the perturbation in ln \u00e3. Only the spatial\nvariation of \u03b6 is significant, and to make contact with observation we can work with\nits Fourier components in a box a bit bigger than the observable Universe, setting\nthe zero mode equal to zero so that \u03b6 has vanishing spatial average.\nOne can also consider a slicing whose metric has the form in Eq. (6.2) without\nthe \u03b6 factor, which we call the flat slicing. Starting from any initial flat slice at time\ntini , let us define the amount of expansion\n\"\n\n#\n\n\u00e3(t)\nN(t, x) \u2261 ln\n,\na(tini )\n\n(6.3)\n\nto a final slice of uniform energy density. Then [110, 127, 196, 210, 211]\n\u03b6(t, x) = \u03b4N \u2261 N(t, x) \u2212 N0 (t) ,\nwhere\n\n\"\n\n#\n\na(t)\nN0 (t) \u2261 ln\n,\na(tini )\n100\n\n(6.4)\n\n(6.5)\n\n\fis the unperturbed amount of expansion.\nTo make use of the above formalism we assume that in the superhorizon regime\n(aH \u226b k), the evolution of the Universe at each position (the local evolution) is\nwell approximated by the evolution of some unperturbed universe [12, 127, 140, 197,\n222]. This 'separate universe' assumption will presumably be correct on cosmological\nscales because these scales are so big [140].\nBy virtue of the separate universe assumption, N(t, x) is the amount of expansion\nin some unperturbed universe, allowing \u03b6 to be evaluated knowing the evolution of\na family of such universes. For a given content of the Universe it can be checked\nusing the gradient expansion [106, 107, 127, 179, 193] method, but we do not wish\nto assume a specific content.\nThe separate universe assumption leads also to local energy conservation. Indeed,\nusing the uniform density slicing, and remembering that \u00e3 determines the expansion,\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\n\u03c1\u0307(t) = \u22123H\u0303[\u03c1(t) + P (t, x)] = \u22123 H + \u03b6\u0307 [\u03c1(t) + P (t, x)] ,\n\n(6.6)\n\n \u0307\nwhere H\u0303 \u2261 \u00e3/\u00e3,\n\u03c1 is the energy density, and P is the pressure. During any era when\nP is a unique function of \u03c1 (the adiabatic condition), P is uniform on the chosen\nslicing; then \u03b6\u0307 vanishes (because it is uniform and its spatial average vanishes)\nso that \u03b6 is conserved (see Subsection 2.2.3). This consequence of the separate\nuniverse assumption was first recognised in full generality in Refs. [127, 179] (see also\nRef. [193] for the case of inflation, Refs. [140, 222] for the case of linear perturbation\ntheory, and Refs. [106, 107] for a coordinate-free treatment).\n\n6.3\n\nThe inflationary prediction\n\nThe evolution of the observable Universe, smoothed on the shortest cosmological\nscale, is supposed to be determined by the values of one or more light scalar fields\nwhen that scale first emerges from the quantum regime a few Hubble times after\nhorizon exit. Defined on a flat slicing, each field \u03c6i at this epoch will be of the form\n\u03c6i (x) \u2261 \u03c6i0 + \u03b4\u03c6i (x).\nBecause quasi exponential inflation is assumed, and only light fields are considered, it is a good approximation to take the \u03b4\u03c6i to be almost massless fields living\nin unperturbed quasi de Sitter spacetime [112, 130]. In these circumstances the\nperturbations \u03b4\u03c6i generated from the vacuum are almost gaussian, with an almost\nflat spectrum whose amplitude is [30, 37]\nH\u2217\n.\n(6.7)\n2\u03c0\nNow we invoke the separate universe assumption, and choose the homogeneous\nquantities \u03c6i0 to correspond to the unperturbed universe. Then Eq. (6.4) for \u03b6\nbecomes\nA\u03b4\u03c6i \u2248\n\n\u03b6(t, x) = N(\u03c1(t), \u03c61 (x), \u03c62(x), * * *) \u2212 N(\u03c1(t), \u03c610 , \u03c620 , * * *) .\n101\n\n(6.8)\n\n\fIn this expression, the expansion N is evaluated in an unperturbed universe, from\nan epoch when the fields have assigned values to one when the energy density has an\nassigned value \u03c1. This expression [110, 127, 196, 210, 211] allows one to propagate\nforward the stochastic properties of \u03b6 to the epoch when it becomes observable,\ngiven those of the initial field perturbations.\nSince the observed curvature perturbation is almost gaussian, it must be given\nto good accuracy by one or more of the linear terms\n\u03b6(t, x) \u2243\n\nX\n\nN,i (t)\u03b4\u03c6i (x) ,\n\n(6.9)\n\ni\n\nwhere we use the notation\n\u2202N\n,\n\u2202\u03c6i0\n\u22022N\n,\n\u2261\n\u2202\u03c6i0 \u2202\u03c6j0\n\nN,i \u2261\nN,ij\n\n(6.10)\n(6.11)\n\nwith the field perturbations being almost gaussian.

[14, 16, 17, 18,\n19, 20]. See also footnotes 8 and 9 in Chapter 5).\nWe shall take P\u03b6 (k) and fNL to be evaluated when cosmological scales approach\nthe horizon and \u03b6 becomes observable. Observation gives |A\u03b6 | \u2248 5 \u00d7 10\u22125 [207], and\n< 100 [102]. Absent of a detection, this will eventually come down to roughly\n|fNL | \u223c\n< 1 [103].\n|fNL | \u223c\nIgnoring any non-gaussianity of the \u03b4\u03c6i , our formula in Eq. (6.12) makes fNL\npractically independent of the wavenumbers. Indeed, generalising the result found\nin Ref. [32], we have calculated (see Appendix A)\nA2\u03b6\nN,i N,j N,ij\n3\n\u2212 fNL = ijhP\ni2 + ln(kL)\n5\n2\n2 i N,i 2\nP\n\nP\n\nijk\n\nN,ij N,jk N,ki\n\nhP\n\n2\ni N,i\n\ni3\n\n.\n\n(6.20)\n\nIn deriving this expression we used the amplitude of the spectrum A\u03b4\u03c6i \u2248 H\u2217 /2\u03c0\nof the field perturbations, and used Eq. (6.16) to eliminate H\u2217 in favour of A\u03b6 . As\ndiscussed in Ref. [32], the logarithm can be taken to be of order 1, because it involves\nthe size k \u22121 of a typical scale under consideration, relative to the size L of the region\nwithin which the stochastic properties are specified. Except for the logarithm, fNL\nis scale independent if the field perturbations are gaussian.\n2\n\nThe four-point correlation may give a competitive observational signature and can be calculated\nin a similar fashion [32, 88, 164, 215].\n\n103\n\n\fIf only one \u03b4\u03c6i is relevant, Eq.

Eqs. (5.50) and (5.51)].\nThese bispectra add the following contribution to fNL in Eq.

Eq. (5.52)].\n\n6.4.2\n\nCosmological perturbation theory\n\nIn the superhorizon regime the non-linear theory [127] that we have used is a complete description. The basic expression in Eq. (6.8) is non-perturbative, giving \u03b6(t, x)\nin terms of the initial fields and the expansion of a family of unperturbed universes.\nThe second-order expansion in Eq. (6.12) is a matter of convenience. As we shall\nsee it seems to be adequate in practice, but Eq. (6.8) would still be applicable if the\nexpansion converged slowly or not at all.\nCosmological perturbation theory (CPT) is completely different. It is applicable\nboth inside and outside the horizon, being at each instant a power series in the\nperturbations of the metric and the stress-energy tensor, together with whatever\nvariables are needed to completely specify the latter and close the system of equations. During inflation these variables are the components of the inflaton, while\nafterwards they may involve oscillating fields and a description of the particle content. First-order CPT is usually adequate and can describe non-gaussianity at the\nlevel |fNL | \u226b 1 which has to be generated by the second-order term in Eq. (6.12).\nSecond-order CPT3 is generally needed only to handle non-gaussianity at the level\n|fNL | \u223c 1.\n3\n\nFor a full set of CPT equations see e.g. Ref. [144].\n\n104\n\n\fQuantised CPT is needed to calculate the stochastic properties of the initial field\nperturbations \u03b4\u03c6i , which are the input for our calculation. The slow-roll spectrum\nin Eq. (6.7) comes from the first-order calculation. The bispectrum is a second-order\neffect and has, in the context of slow-roll inflation, been calculated in Refs. [142, 200]\n[c.f. Eqs. (5.50) - (5.52)]. It is shown elsewhere [141] that \u2206fNL is in this case\n\u221a\n< 10\u22122 with\nnegligible compared to 1, being generically below (15/24)fSL rT \u03b6 \u03b5 \u223c\n1/3 \u2264 fSL \u2264 11/18 [c.f. Eqs. (5.52) and (6.24)]4 . Higher order correlators have not\nbeen calculated yet and would give an additional contribution to Eq. (6.20), which\npresumably is also negligible. A few single field non slow-roll models [9, 43, 199, 203]\nhave been investigated where it is found that \u2206fNL could be much bigger than 1.\nFrom now on we take the \u03b4\u03c6i to be gaussian.\nIn the regime aH \u226b k, perturbation theory must be compatible with Eq. (6.12).\nIn particular, the non-local terms, present at second order for a generic perturbation,\nmust be absent for \u03b6. Finally, CPT is needed to evolve the perturbations after\nhorizon entry, but that is not our concern here. In the following, we apply our\nformalism to calculate fNL in various cases and compare it with the CPT result\nwhere that is known.\n\n6.5\n6.5.1\n\nThe \u03b4N formalism in some multi-component\nmodels\nA two-component inflation model\n\nAs a first use of Eq. (6.20) we consider the two-component inflation model of Kadota\nand Stewart [90, 91], estimating for the first time the non-gaussianity which it predicts. The model works with a complex field \u03a6, which is supposed to be a modulus\nwith a point of enhanced symmetry at the origin. The scalar potential is given by\n1\n1\nV = Vh \u2212 m2 |\u03a6|2 + Am2 [\u03a63 + \u03a6\u22173 ] + \u03bd(\u03bd + 1)A2 m2 |\u03a6|4 ,\n3\n2\n\n(6.25)\n\nwith A being fixed so that the vacuum energy vanishes at the minimum of the\npotential, and \u03bd = {1, 2, 3, ...}. Writing\n\u03a6 = |\u03a6|ei\u03b8 ,\n\n(6.26)\n\nthe tree level potential has a maximum at \u03a60 = 0 and depends on both |\u03a6| and \u03b8.\nA one-loop correction turns the maximum into a crater and inflation occurs while \u03a6\nis rolling away from the rim of the crater (see Fig. 6.1). The curvature perturbation\n4\n\nIn Ref. [183] (see also Refs. [83, 182]) Rigopoulos et. al. calculated the three-point correlator\nof \u03b6 in general multi-component inflationary models using a stochastic approach. Their result is\nquite puzzling since the wavevector dependence seems to be significant even well after horizon exit.\nReconciliation between the approach followed in Ref. [183] and ours [132] is desirable [184].\n\n105\n\n\f\u221a\nFigure 6.1: Equipotential layers and trajectory of the field \u03a6 \u2261 (\u03a6R + i\u03a6I )/ 2 in\nthe Kadota and Stewart's model of Refs.

For \u03b80 \u226a \u03b8c , with \u03b8c\nbeing a parameter of the model, it is found that [91]\nN\u221d\n\n\u03b8c\n.\n\u03b80\n\n(6.27)\n\nfNL \u2243\n\n\u03b80\n,\n\u03b8c\n\n(6.28)\n\nThrough the first term of Eq. (6.20)\n\nwhich is too small ever to be observed.\n\n6.5.2\n\nThe curvaton model\n\nIn the curvaton model [138, 139, 159] (see also Refs. [66, 116, 156] and Subsection\n2.4.2) the curvature perturbation \u03b6 grows, from a negligible value in an initially\nradiation dominated epoch, due to the oscillations of a weakly coupled light field \u03c3\n(the curvaton) around the minimum of its quadratic potential\n1\nV\u03c3 (t, x) = m2\u03c3 \u03c3 2 (t, x) ,\n2\n106\n\n(6.29)\n\n\fwhere m\u03c3 is the curvaton effective mass. Due to the oscillations, the initially negligible curvaton energy density redshifts as\n1\n\u03c1\u03c3 (t, x) \u2248 m2\u03c3 \u03c3a2 (t, x) \u221d a\u22123 (t, x) ,\n(6.30)\n2\nwhere \u03c3a represents the amplitude of the oscillations. Meanwhile the radiation\nenergy density \u03c1r redshifts as a\u22124 . Soon after the curvaton decay, the standard Hot\nBig-Bang is recovered and \u03b6 is assumed to be conserved until horizon reentry.\nTo calculate fNL using Eq. (6.20) we first realise that \u03c3\u2217 (the unperturbed value\nof \u03c3 a few Hubble times after horizon exit) is the only relevant quantity since the\ncurvature perturbation produced by the inflaton, and imprinted in the radiation\nfluid during the reheating process, is supposed to be negligible. Thus, Eq. (6.22)\napplies. Second, we can redefine N as the number of e-folds from the beginning\nof the sinusoidal oscillations to the curvaton decay. This is because the number of\ne-folds from the end of inflation to the beginning of the oscillations is completely\nunperturbed as the radiation energy density dominates during that time. Thus, N\nis now a function of three variables\n!\n\"1 2\n#\nm [g(\u03c3\u2217 )]2\n1\n1\n\u03c1\u03c3osc\n2 \u03c3\n= ln\n,\n(6.31)\nN(\u03c1dec , \u03c1osc , \u03c3\u2217 ) = ln\n3\n\u03c1\u03c3dec\n3\n\u03c1\u03c3dec\nwhere g \u2261 \u03c3osc is the amplitude at the beginning of the sinusoidal oscillations as\na function of \u03c3\u2217 . Here the curvaton energy density just before the curvaton decay\n\u03c1\u03c3dec is expressed in terms of the total energy density \u03c1dec at that time, the total\nenergy density at the beginning of the sinusoidal oscillations \u03c1osc , and g by\n\u03c1\u03c3dec\n\n1\n\u03c1dec \u2212 \u03c1\u03c3dec\n= m2\u03c3 [g(\u03c3\u2217 )]2\n2\n\u03c1osc\n\n!3/4\n\n.\n\n(6.32)\n\nAfter evaluating \u2202/\u2202\u03c3\u2217 = g \u2032\u2202/\u2202g, at fixed \u03c1dec and \u03c1osc , we obtain\n2 g\u2032\nN,\u03c3\u2217 = r ,\n3 g\nwhere\n\n(6.33)\n\n3\u03c1\u03c3dec\n,\n(6.34)\n3\u03c1\u03c3dec + 4\u03c1rdec\nthe radiation energy density just before the curvaton decay, giving\nr\u2261\n\nbeing \u03c1rdec\n\nH\u2217\nH\u2217 r g \u2032\nN,\u03c3\u2217 =\n,\n(6.35)\n2\u03c0\n3\u03c0 g\nin agreement with first-order cosmological perturbation theory in the sudden decay\napproximation [138, 139, 159] (see Subsection 2.4.2).

[17, 126, 131, 138] and Subsection 5.7.4).\n107\n\n\f6.5.3\n\nAnother two-component model\n\nFinally we consider the two-component inflation model of Ref. [67] (see also Refs. [131,\n214] and Subsection 5.7.2). For at least some number N of e-folds after cosmological\nscales leave the horizon, the potential in Eq. (5.56) is written as\nV = Vh\n\n1 \u03c62\n1 \u03b82\n1 + \u03b7\u03c6 2 + \u03b7\u03b8 2\n2 mP\n2 mP\n\n!\n\n,\n\n(6.37)\n\nwith the first term dominating, and \u03b7\u03c6 and \u03b7\u03b8 being the slow-roll \u03b7 parameters. The\nidea is to use Eq. (6.20) to calculate the non-gaussianity after the N e-folds which,\nbarring cancellations, will place a lower limit on the observed non-gaussianity.\nThe slow-roll equations give the background field values \u03c60 (N) and \u03b80 (N) after\nN e-folds, in terms of those obtaining just after horizon exit\n\u03c60 (N) = \u03c60 exp(\u2212N\u03b7\u03c6 ) ,\n\u03b80 (N) = \u03b80 exp(\u2212N\u03b7\u03b8 ) .\n\n(6.38)\n(6.39)\n\nThis gives\nV0 (N, \u03c60 , \u03b80 ) = Vh\n\n1 \u03c62\n1 \u03b82\n1 + \u03b7\u03c6 02 e\u22122N \u03b7\u03c6 + \u03b7\u03b8 02 e\u22122N \u03b7\u03b8\n2 mP\n2 mP\n\n!\n\n,\n\n(6.40)\n\nand allows us to calculate the derivatives of N with respect to \u03c60 and \u03b80 at fixed\nV . Focusing on the case \u03b80 = 0 considered in Ref. [67], we find\n\u03b4\u03c6\n\u03b7\u03c6\n\u03b6=\n\u2212\n\u03b7\u03c6 \u03c60\n2\n\n\u03b4\u03c6\n\u03b7\u03c6 \u03c60\n\n!2\n\n\u03b4\u03b8\n\u03b7\u03b8\n+ e2N (\u03b7\u03c6 \u2212\u03b7\u03b8 )\n2\n\u03b7\u03c6 \u03c60\n\n!2\n\n,\n\n(6.41)\n\nin agreement with the second-order perturbation calculation of Ref. [144]. If the\nobserved \u03b6 has a non-gaussian part \u03b6\u03c3 equal to the last term of Eq. (6.41) and a\ngaussian part generated mostly after inflation, one can obtain |fNL | > 1 by choosing\n\u03b7\u03c6 > 0.26, \u03b7\u03b8 = \u03b7\u03c6 /2, N = 70, and \u03b6\u03c3 = 10\u22122 \u03b6.\nOur calculated expression for the coefficient of (\u03b4\u03b8)2 is in disagreement with the\none found in Ref. [214] [c.f. Eq. (5.68)] which uses a set of CPT equations based on\nthose presented in Ref. [3]5 . After converting the variable used there [131, 217] to\nour \u03b6 (see Subsection 5.3.3), these equations give \u03b6\u0307 in terms of first-order quantities,\nbut they contain non-local terms involving the inverse Laplacian [133]. Comparison\nwith our non-linear expression in Eq. (6.8) shows that such terms must cancel if\ncorrectly evaluated.\n5\n\nThe initial calculations of the structural form of \u03b6 in this model using CPT [67, 131] were in\ngross conflict with Eq. (6.41). This is because the time evolutions of \u03c6 and \u03b8 outside the horizon\nwere not considered. The sources of discrepancy were recognised in Ref. [214], showing that the\nactual order of magnitude is in agreement with Eq. (6.41) except for the presence of non-local\nterms (see Subsection 5.7.2).\n\n108\n\n\f6.6\n\nConclusions\n\nThe \u03b4N formalism is a non-perturbative approach to calculate the curvature perturbation \u03b6 at all orders, in terms only of background quantities that describe the\nevolution of a family of unperturbed universes. Such a formalism was originally\nintroduced to calculate the spectrum of \u03b6 at first order [196, 210, 211] (see also\nRef. [110]) in multi-component inflationary models. Now, with the increasing interest in the non-gaussian features of \u03b6 in both single- and multi-component inflationary\nmodels, the formalism has been extended to calculate the curvature perturbation\nat second order \u03b62 and the normalisation fNL of the bispectrum [132]. The \u03b4N formalism relies on the separate universe assumption, which says that on superhorizon\nscales the Universe behaves locally as if it were unperturbed [12, 127, 140, 197, 222],\nand on the intrinsic gaussianity of the fields \u03c6i involved. The quantities \u03b62 and fNL\nare easily given in terms of the first and second derivatives of the unperturbed number of e-folds N, from an epoch when the fields have assigned values \u03c6i0 to one when\nthe energy density has an assigned value \u03c1, with respect to the unperturbed fields\n\u03c6i0 . The possible intrinsic non-gaussianity of the fields \u03c6i would lead to an additional\ncontribution to fNL , highly wavevector dependent [200] but in any case negligible\ncompared to 1 [141]. The \u03b4N formalism reproduces [132, 200] the well known results\nin single-component inflation [142], in the curvaton scenario [17, 126, 131, 138], and\nin the 'hybrid' model of Enqvist and V\u00e4ihk\u00f6nen [144]. In addition, the Kadota and\nStewart's modular inflation model [90, 91] has served as an example of the power\nof this formalism. The \u03b4N formalism is an interesting alternative to cosmological\nperturbation theory where, order by order, the relevant expressions to calculate \u03b62\nand fNL tend to be more and more complicated (see for example Refs. [3, 67, 144]).\nNevertheless, it is true that the latter is valid on all the scales, while the former\nis only valid in the superhorizon regime. Fortunately, the subhorizon effects are\nnegligible [141, 200] making the \u03b4N formalism reliable and completely independent\nof cosmological perturbation theory.\n\n109\n\n\fChapter 7\nConclusions\nPrior to the standard Hot Big-Bang, a period of accelerated expansion seems to\nhave been crucial [79]. Not only does this period solve the classical problems of\nthe Big-Bang cosmological model, namely the horizon, flatness, and unwanted relics\nproblems, but it also amplifies the fluctuations in the light scalar fields \u03c6i living\nin the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker spacetime [12, 80, 84, 118, 162, 163, 185, 210].\nThis inflationary process serves also for the scalar field fluctuations to become classical soon after horizon exit [4, 78, 81, 122, 124], giving birth to the primordial\nperturbations in the energy density that generate the temperature anisotropies in\nthe cosmic microwave background radiation, and, through gravitational collapse,\nthe large-scale structure observed today. Such primordial perturbations can be defined perturbatively on a homogeneous and isotropic background, but the freedom\nto choose the perturbed coordinate system makes them gauge dependent. To characterize adequately the primordial perturbations, we introduce the gauge-invariant\ncurvature perturbation \u03b6 [11] which represents the intrinsic spatial curvature on\nslices of uniform energy density (or slices with zero flow of energy). While the pressure is a unique function of the energy density, \u03b6 is conserved at all orders [127, 179],\nwhich makes this an ideal quantity. In this thesis we have explored some of the theoretical and statistical aspects of the origin of the large-scale structure, such as the\ntwo most known scenarios to generate \u03b6 (the inflaton and the curvaton scenario),\nthe required inflationary energy scale in those scenarios, and the non-gaussianity\nassociated to \u03b6.\nIn general \u03b6 depends on the perturbations in the scalar fields \u03c6i during the\ninflationary period, whose spectra P\u03b4\u03c6i (k) are generically the same for all kinds of\nquasi exponential expansion either the respective field dominates the energy density\nor not. The only appreciable difference is in the way the scale dependence is given in\nterms of the Hubble parameter H\u2217 a few Hubble times after horizon exit and the mass\nm\u03c6i of the respective field. However, the spectrum of \u03b6, P\u03b6 (k), varies significantly\namong the different possible scenarios for the origin of the large-scale structure,\nalthough in all cases it is almost gaussian and scale invariant. We have studied in\nChapter 2 two different scenarios for the origin of \u03b6, the inflaton [5, 112, 117, 130] and\n110\n\n\fthe curvaton scenario [138, 139, 159] (see also Refs. [66, 116, 156]), pointing out their\ndifferent signatures and connecting them with the amplitude of gravitational waves\nproduced in each scenario. Both scenarios have their advantages and drawbacks.\nFor example, the single-component inflaton scenario presents a consistency relation\nthat relates the amplitude of P\u03b6 (k) with the amplitude of the gravitational waves\nspectrum PT (k) [2, 68, 111, 112, 190]. The possible detection of gravitational waves\nis consistent with this scenario and would serve as a smoking gun if the consistency\nrelation is satisfied. The drawback is that the generation of \u03b6 by the inflaton field \u03c6\n(the field which drives inflation) imposes severe constraints on the theoretical model\nbuilding [49, 160, 161]. In contrast, the curvaton scenario circumvents the latter\nproblem since the generation of \u03b6 is assigned to a weakly coupled scalar field \u03c3 (the\ncurvaton) different to the inflaton. The drawbacks are that there is no consistency\nrelation in this case, and that the scenario is inconsistent with a detectable level of\ngravitational waves [138].\nThere exists several well motivated inflationary models that locate the inflaton field within a particle physics framework [125, 130]. Most of these models are\nhowever unrealistic due to the strong constraints mentioned above. In particular,\nthe generation of adiabatic perturbations is almost inconsistent with the low inflationary energy scale, given by H\u2217 , required to identify the inflaton with one of\nthe many fields present in supersymmetry. The curvaton scenario comes to rescue\nthese models, allowing for a much lower inflationary energy scale. But how low may\nthis energy scale be in the curvaton scenario?. In Chapter 3 we have discussed the\nlower bound on H\u2217 in the simplest curvaton setup, showing that it is high enough\n[126] (H\u2217 > 107 GeV) to fail at rescuing the inflationary models whose potentials are\ngenerated by some mechanism of gravity-mediated supersymmetry breaking where\nH\u2217 \u223c 103 GeV is required. The general conditions to obtain low scale inflation in the\ncurvaton scenario have been given in that chapter [51], in terms of three quantities\n\u01eb, f , and \u03b4, that parameterize respectively the evolution of the curvaton field from\nthe time of horizon exit to the beginning of its oscillations, the effective curvaton\nmass m\u0303\u03c3 at the end of a phase transition with respect to the Hubble parameter\nat the same time, and the time of the phase transition with respect to the time of\nhorizon exit. In Chapters 3 and 4 we have invoked the 'heavy curvaton' picture\n[126], defined as the setup where \u03c3 suddenly increases its mass at the end of a phase\ntransition much later than inflation [149]. The mass increment is given by the coupling of \u03c3 (parameterized by the constant \u03bb) with another field which acquires a\nlarge vacuum expectation value at the end of the same period. Thus, the smallness\nof the parameters f and \u03b4 are exploited to allow for an inflationary scale consistent\nwith gravity-mediated susy breaking1 . In the cases presented in these two chapters\nthe phase transition is associated with the end of a second (thermal) inflationary\nperiod, which was originally introduced to dilute the abundances of unwanted relics\nthat the first (main) inflationary period is not able to do (for instance the moduli\n1\nThe parameter \u01eb is in these cases unmodified because it is assumed that the unperturbed\ncomponent of \u03c3 is frozen throughout inflation and until oscillations begin.\n\n111\n\n\ffields) [136, 137]. Thermal inflation is driven by the confinement of a second (flaton)\nfield \u03c7 at the origin of the potential due to the thermal effects from the radiation\nbackground left by the inflaton decay [13]. The eventual rolling of \u03c7, towards the\nminimum of its potential, ends thermal inflation and triggers an increment in the\nbare mass m\u03c3 of \u03c3 through the coupling of the latter with \u03c7. Solving the moduli\nproblem while satisfying adequately all the constraints in the first model discussed\nin Chapter 3, where the curvaton oscillates for some time before decaying, restricts\nthe parameter space to a region where the two important parameters, \u03bb and m\u03c3 , are\n< \u221210 and m\u03c3 < 10\u22121 GeV) [51]. It is likely\nrequired to be very small (10\u221222 <\n\u223c \u03bb \u223c 10\n\u223c\nthen that the curvaton field is a pseudo Nambu-Goldstone boson. In contrast, as\ndiscussed in the second model presented in Chapter 4, if the increment in the mass\nof the curvaton field is so high that the decay rate overtakes the Hubble parameter,\nleading to the immediate decay of \u03c3, the parameter space is less constrained, with\n< \u22124\n<\nmore natural values for \u03bb and m\u03c3 (10\u221210 <\n\u223c \u03bb \u223c 10 and m\u03c3 \u223c 1 GeV) [189].\nAlthough \u03b6 is found to be almost perfectly gaussian in most of the models that\ngive account of its origin, as required by observation, the possibly present small\nnon-gaussianity is being scrutinized by present experiments like the WMAP satellite [223] and will be the focus of future experiments like the PLANCK satellite\n[171]. The first statistical significant quantity that gives us information about the\nlevel of non-gaussianity is the bispectrum, which corresponds to the three-point correlator of \u03b6 [103]. Its normalisation is given by the parameter fNL , which has been\n< 102 [102] but that will eventually go down to |fNL | \u223c 1 in the\nfound to be |fNL | \u223c\nforthcoming years unless there is an earlier detection [103]. In view of the difficulty\nat discriminating between models by means of only the spectral index and/or consistency relations, the detection of non-gaussianity and a precise determination of fNL\nwould be useful tools to serve this purpose. For example, in the single-component\ninflaton scenario the level of non-gaussianity is very small, being |fNL | or the order\nof the slow-roll parameters [142]. In contrast, in the curvaton scenario |fNL | could be\nmuch higher, being fNL negative, or, if \u03c3 has already dominated the energy density\nbefore decaying, the precise value for fNL would be fNL = +5/4 [17, 131, 138]. In\nChapters 5 and 6 we have addressed this subject, following a perturbative approach\nin the former, and a non-perturbative one in the latter. In Chapter 5 we have\npresented in an unified way the different definitions of the second-order curvature\nperturbation \u03b62 present in the literature [3, 131, 140, 145, 178]. The translation\nrules to go from one definition to another have been explicitly given, and would help\nto avoid the possible confusion when confronting different papers and results which\nuse different definitions for \u03b62 [131]. We have examined the predictions for fNL coming from the single-component inflation model, the multi-component one, and the\ncurvaton scenario, discussing also the respective predictions in preheating and the\ninhomogeneous reheating scenario. Although multi-component inflation, preheating,\nand the inhomogeneous reheating scenarios do not predict a definite value or set of\nvalues for fNL , being very dependent on the specific model, the single-component\ninflaton scenario as well as the curvaton one do give definite predictions for fNL\n112\n\n\f[131]. Multi-component slow-roll inflation is studied in Chapter 6 following the nonperturbative \u03b4N formalism [110, 127, 196, 210, 211], that allows us to calculate \u03b6\nat all orders only by knowing the evolution of a family of unperturbed universes.\nImmediate applications of this formalism are the calculation of the spectral index\n[196], and fNL [132], in a general multi-component slow-roll inflation model. The\nformalism relies on the separate universe assumption, which says that the local evolution of the Universe on superhorizon scales is the same as that of an unperturbed\nuniverse [12, 127, 140, 197, 222]. The normalisation parameter fNL is easily given in\nterms of first and second derivatives of the number of e-folds, from an initially flat\nslice to a final uniform energy density slice, with respect to the fields living in the\nformer. The intrinsic non-gaussianity in the fields \u03c6i relevant for the evolution of\nthe family of universes may be also taken into account, but its contribution, which\nis highly wavevector dependent [142, 200], is in any case negligible compared to\n1 [141]. Comparison of this formalism with cosmological perturbation theory has\nbeen made, in the case of the curvaton scenario [132] and the 'hybrid' [67] model of\nEnqvist and V\u00e4ihk\u00f6nen [132, 144, 214]. According to Ref. [144] the results for the\nlatter model following the two approaches agree, and moreover they refute the claim\nabout the possible presence of non-local terms in cosmological perturbation theory\n[3, 14, 67, 214].\n\n113\n\n\fAppendix A\nfNL from the \u03b4N formalism\nIn this appendix we derive explicitly the expression in Eq. (6.20) which gives the\nnormalisation fNL of the bispectrum of \u03b6 defined in Eqs. (6.17) and (6.18).\nWe begin by writing \u03b6 as given by Eq.
