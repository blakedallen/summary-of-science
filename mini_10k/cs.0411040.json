Besides maximizing the lifetime of the\nsensor nodes, it is preferable to distribute the energy\ndissipated throughout the wireless sensor network in order\nto minimize maintenance and maximize overall system\nperformance.\nAny\ncommunication\nprotocol\nthat\ninvolves\nsynchronization between peer nodes incurs some\noverhead of setting up the communication. Obviously,\neach node could make the most informed decision\nregarding its communication options if they had complete\nknowledge of the entire network topology and power\nlevels of all the nodes in the network. This should yield\nthe best performance if the synchronization messages are\nnot taken into account. However, since all the nodes\nwould always have to know everything, it should be clear\nthat there will be many more synchronization messages\nthan data messages, and therefore ideal case algorithms\nare not feasible in a system where communication is very\nexpensive.\n\nThe usual topology of wireless sensor networks involves\nhaving many network nodes dispersed throughout a\nspecific physical area. There is usually no specific\narchitecture or hierarchy in place and therefore, the\nwireless sensor networks are considered as ad hoc\nnetworks.\nThat does not mean that a dynamic\norganization is not allowed, however it just cannot be\npredefined in advance.\nAn ad hoc wireless sensor network is an autonomous\nsystem of sensor nodes in which all nodes act as routers\nconnected by wireless links. Although ad hoc networks\nusually imply that nodes are free to move randomly and\norganize themselves arbitrarily, in this paper we\nconsidered only ad hoc networks with fixed node\npositions.\nOn the other hand, wireless links are not very reliable and\nnodes might stop operating at arbitrary points within the\nsystem's life; therefore, the routing protocol utilized must\nbe able to handle arbitrary failure of nodes throughout the\nnetwork. Such a network may operate in a standalone\nfashion, or it may be connected to other networks, such as\nthe larger Internet.\nEventually, the data retrieved by the sensors must be\npropagated back to a central location, where further\nprocessing must be done in order to analyze the data and\nextract meaningful information from the large amounts of\ndata. With plentiful available power, each node could\ntheoretically communicate with the base station directly,\nhowever due to a limited power supply, spatial reuse of\nwireless bandwidth, and the nature of radio\ncommunication cost which is a function of the distance\ntransmitted squared, it is ideal to send information in\nseveral smaller distance wise steps rather than one\ntransmission over a long communication distance [1,2].\nSome typical applications for wireless sensors include the\ncollection of massive amounts of sensor data. They can\nfacilitate communication with the user's environment,\nsuch as beacons or sources of information throughout the\nphysical space [5]. Some other typical examples are\nenvironmental sensors, automotive sensors, highway\nmonitoring sensors, and biomedical sensors.\nIn our simulation, we use a data collection problem in\nwhich the system is driven by rounds of communication,\nand each sensor node has a packet to send to the distant\n\n\fbase station. The diffusion algorithm is based on\nlocation, power levels, and load on the node, and its goal\nis to distribute the power consumption throughout the\nnetwork so that the majority of the nodes consume their\npower supply at relatively the same rate regardless of\nphysical location. This leads to better maintainability of\nthe system because of better predictability, and\nmaximizing the overall system performance by allowing\nthe network to function at 100% capacity throughout most\nof its lifetime instead of having a steadily decreasing node\npopulation.\n\nsupply for each wireless sensor is almost irrelevant since\nthe results between the various algorithms should remain\nrelative to each other no matter what the energy related\nconstants are, however these constants could effect the\nperformance gap between various routing algorithms.\n\nThe major issues concerning wireless sensor networks are\npower management, longevity, functionality, sensor data\nfusion, robustness, and fault tolerance.\nPower\nmanagement deals with extending battery life and\nreducing power usage while longevity concerns the coordination of sensor activities and optimizations in the\ncommunication protocol. The functionality deals with\nfuture targeted applications. Data fusion encompasses the\ncombining of sensor data, or perhaps data compression.\nObviously, robustness and fault tolerance deals with\nfailing nodes and the erroneous characteristic of the\nwireless communication medium.\n\nLink bandwidth between peer nodes\n\n10 Kbit/s\n\n1 message every XXX seconds\n\n10 second\n\nSome progress has been made toward overcoming some\nof these major issues. For example, LEACH (LowEnergy Adap-tive Clustering Hierarchy) [3] and\nPEGASIS (Power-Efficient GAthering in Sensor\nInformation Systems) [4] have very similar goals\ncompared to what we are proposing. Their biggest\nshortcomings deal with unrealistic assumptions and\nalgorithms that do not exploit the spatial information\nregarding the network. It is also worthwhile to mention a\nrouting algorithm, namely directed diffusion [9], which\nhas a similar name but is quite different than our proposed\ndiffusion based algorithm.\n\n2.2\n\nSimulation Constants\n\nAccording to Table 1, we establish the constants that\ndrive the simulation results.\nDescription\n\nValue\n\nTotal size of the packet\n\n50 bytes\n\nTransmission amplification cost for\nradio transmitter\n\n1.8 micro\njoule/bit/m2\n\nTransmission cost for running the\nradio circuitry per bits processed\n\n2.51789 micro\njoule/bit\n\nReception cost for running the radio\ncircuitry per bit processed\n\n2.02866 micro\njoule/bit\n\nThe cost for a mote to be in its idle\nstate; it is a function related to time\n\n1000 micro\njoule/second\n\nThe initial energy each mote is given.\n\n15390 joule\n\nArea of node distribution\n\n100x100 meter\n\nThe number of nodes in the network\n\n100 nodes\n\nTable 1: Constants utilized throughout the simulation\n2.3\n\nNode Distribution\n\nIn this paper, we established the nodes' positions\naccording to a normal distribution with the mean and the\nstandard deviation both equal to 50. The base station\npositioned at coordinates (0,0) on the x-axis and y-axis\nrespectively and an area defined by 100X100 meters.\n\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2\ncovers our evaluation test-bed; we explain our own\nrealistic assumptions based on real world sensors, the\nsensors hardware on which we based our assumptions,\nand the distribution of the sensor nodes. Section 3 covers\nthe description of the proposed diffusion based routing\nalgorithm. We finally conclude with Section 4 in which\nwe talk about future work.\n2.0\nSIMULATION\nASSUMPTIONS\n2.1\n\nTEST-BED\n\nAND\n\nSoftware/Hardware Architecture\n\nOur simulation is based on real world wireless sensors,\nspecifically the Rene RF motes designed at University of\nCalifornia, Berkeley (UCB) [6]. We decided to base our\nwork on these sensors purely because they offer a good\narchitecture to validate the findings of this paper. An\nimportant aspect of our research is that the details of\npower consumption or the energy capacity of the battery\n\nFigure 1: Sample node distribution using an area of 100\nmeters by 100 meters and having 100 nodes.\n3.0\nDIFFUSION\nALGORITHM\n\nBASED\n\nROUTING\n\nThe most na\u00efve approach would be for all nodes to\ndirectly communicate with the base station, regardless of\n\n\fhow far the respective node is from the base station. It\nshould be evident that this model will not be suitable for\nour goals since nodes far away from the base station\nwould deplete their power supply much quicker than\nnodes that are close to the base station.\n\nThese three conditions in which the receivers will issue\nexception messages towards their senders will allow each\nnode to make the best decision in terms of choosing a\nneighbor that is both cost effective distance wise and\nneighbor conscious in terms of energy and load levels.\n\nA na\u00efve diffusion based routing algorithm based solely on\nspatial information (eg. distance derived from radio signal\nstrength). Each node would make a list of all available\nnode neighbors and their preferences based on distance.\nOnce this has been established, each node will send to\ntheir corresponding neighbor until the receiver's power is\ndepleted, at which time the sender will choose a different\nneighbor to communicate with. This has the drawback of\nnodes that are close to the base station having very short\nlife spans since their primary task is to route messages for\nthe entire network, and hence they will die first.\nSimilarly, nodes that are furthest away from the base\nstation will live the longest since they merely\ncommunicate with a close neighbor and do not have to\nrelay messages for anyone.\n\n4.0\n\nBy using location, power levels, and node loads, we can\nmake the local greedy decisions more effective therefore\nachieve efficient, even power dissipation distribution\nacross all nodes. Each node will act as a relay as each\nnode forwards messages of its peer nodes towards the\nbase station. Each node will locally decide the best\nneighbors to communicate with using radio signal\nstrength, battery power, and load at the neighboring\nnodes. The main neighbor selection (based on radio\nsignal strength) would happen at the startup of the system.\nAfterwards, when a series of events occur, there will be\nsynchronization messages between each sender and\nreceiver that will allow the senders to update their\nneighbor information with their battery power and load.\nThere will be no keep alive messages since we will\nassume that nodes do not arbitrarily fail and that they only\nfail due to inadequate power levels. If we want to address\narbitrary failures of nodes, which might be a more\nrealistic assumption, we should use some form of alive\nmessages, whether implicit or explicit.\nThe synchronization messages that would advise a sender\nto seek another neighbor to transmit to would occur when\ncertain conditions would be met. The first condition\nwould be if the receiver's power levels are lower than that\nof the sender. Notice that this can be calculated easily\nwithout any extra messages being transmitted since the\nsender can include its power level information along with\nthe data. The second condition would be if the receiver's\npower levels are drained below a certain threshold in\nwhich the receiver does not want to service any more\nrequests other than its own. The third condition is if the\nreceiver's queues are full and it cannot handle any more\nrequests. If any of these conditions are met, then the\nreceiver can issue an exception message to the sender to\nchoose an alternate neighbor.\n\nEXPERIMENTAL RESULTS\n\nDue to the space constraints of this paper and early stage\nof our work, our experimental results are very thin from\nthe point of view of comparing our proposed algorithm\nwith related work that has similar goals to ours. We\nimplemented a C++ based simulation with all of the\nassumptions from section 2.\nTable 1 attempts to capture an overview comparison\nbetween our diffusion based algorithm and other proposed\nalgorithms, namely Leach [3] and Pegasis [4]. The\nalgorithm names in Table 1 can be briefly explained\nbelow.\n\u2022\n\nDirect [3, 4]: direct communication between each\nnode and the base station\n\n\u2022\n\nLeach [3, 4]: clustering-based protocol that utilizes\nrandomized rotation of cluster heads to collect data\nfrom neighboring nodes, aggregate data, and send it\nto the base station\n\n\u2022\n\nPegasis [4]: chain-based protocol, in which group\nheads are chosen randomly and each node\ncommunicates only with a close neighbor forming a\nchain leading to its cluster head, which in turn\ncommunicates with the base station\n\n\u2022\n\nMTE [3]: each node sends to the closest neighbor on\nthe way to the base station solely based on spatial\ninformation (na\u00efve diffusion)\n\n\u2022\n\nStatic Clustering [3]: Same as Leach, but with the\ncluster heads chosen apriori.\n\n\u2022\n\nDiffusion: the proposed algorithm in this paper\nAlgorithm\nName\n\nFirst\nNode\nDies\n\nLast\nNode\nDies\n\n% of System\nLifetime with 100%\nutility\n\nDirect [4]\n\n56\n\n122\n\n45.90%\n\nLeach [4]\n\n690\n\n1077\n\n64.07%\n\nPegasis [4]\n\n1346\n\n3076\n\n43.76%\n\nDirect [3]\n\n217\n\n468\n\n46.37%\n\nMTE [3]\n\n15\n\n843\n\n1.78%\n\nStatic\nClustering [3]\n\n106\n\n240\n\n44.17%\n\nLeach [3]\n\n1848\n\n2608\n\n70.86%\n\nDiffusion\n\n3425\n\n4323\n\n79.23%\n\nTable 1: Summary view of various algorithms from\nrelated work whose goals are similar to ours\n\n\fThe comparison from Table 1 clearly shows the number\nof iterations the system lived with all nodes being alive\nand with all nodes being dead. Note that the proposed\nsystem lived nearly 80% of its lifetime with 100% utility.\nThe number of iterations each algorithm lasted before the\nfirst and last node died should not be compared among the\nvarious algorithms since all these results were extracted\nfrom various works [3, 4] and this paper. Each paper had\ntheir own assumptions about the node characteristics\n(transmit/receive/amplification power dissipation), and\ntherefore the wide range of system lifetimes. What\nshould be evident is the percentage of time each algorithm\nallowed the network to operate at 100% utility. The only\nway to really compare the performance of all these\nalgorithms with our own would be to implement each\nalgorithm using the same assumptions as the ones we\nused for our algorithm; we will reserve this task for future\nwork.\nFigure 2 shows the performance of the system in terms of\nsystem lifetime (iterations) and system utility\n(percentage). We can see that at almost 3500 iterations,\nthe first node dies and in fewer than 900 iterations, the\nentire system is dead. This is quite impressive in relation\nto the simplicity of the algorithm and the amount of\nsynchronization messages that are required.\nNetwork Utility\n\nclustering based routing algorithm similar to LEACH [3]\nand PEGASIS [4]. Comparing our algorithm with these\nother routing algorithms will prove to be most valuable\nand informative. Furthermore, we will address data\naggregation and data fusion in the hopes to further reduce\nthe amount of energy that is used in inter-node\ncommunication.\n6.0\n\nREFERENCES\n\n[1]\n\nR.

The algorithm also has little overhead in terms\nof communication synchronization since most of the\nsynchronization is appended to the actual data\ntransmitted, and therefore it is not very expensive to keep\nthe neighboring nodes synchronized.\nAs future work, we hope to implement various other\nrouting algorihms, namely the simple direct\ncommunication algorithm in which all nodes\ncommunicate directly with the base station, and the\n\n\f"}
