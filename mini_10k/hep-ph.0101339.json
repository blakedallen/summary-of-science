These questions concern\nthe Electric Dipole Moments of electron and neutron and the way people exclude regions of parameter space.\n\n1. Introduction and Outline\nAs this talk was primarily aimed at raising\nquestions that could be discussed in private after\nthe talk or during the workshop, it is not suited\nto be reproduced just as it was given. I will try to\nincorporate the discussion and also results from\nthe discussion into this small article.\nIn the next section I will discuss light gauginos. I will present my opinion about the electric\ndipole moments and their measurements in the\nthird section. My conclusions will follow in section four.\n2. Light gauginos\nWhen supersymmetry (SUSY) was found and\nthe minimal supersymmetric standard model\n(MSSM) was introduced [1], people also looked\nat possibilities to restrict the large number of parameters by symmetry arguments. There are two\ndifferent symmetry arguments. One argument is\nbased on symmetries and simple boundary conditions of the renormalization group equations\n[2]. The second and more straight forward argument is based on symmetries in the low energy\ntheory like lepton number conservation, baryon\nnumber conservation, R\u2013parity, or a continuous\nR\u2013symmetry [3].\nThe continuous R-symmetry restricts the soft\nbreaking parameters quite severely: it puts the\ntrilinear terms and the gaugino mass terms to\nzero. This scenario has been discussed a lot: [4,5].\nOf course, with no independent phases left, all\n\u2217 This\n\nwork was supported by DOE grant DE-FG0296ER40967\n\nSUSY induced CP violation has to vanish. [6]\ntried to quantify this vanishing assuming that the\ncontinuous R\u2013symmetry is only an approximate\nsymmetry. But with no continuous R\u2013symmetry,\nwhat is the motivation for \"light\" gaugino mass\nparameters?\n2.1. What does \"light\" mean?\nPerforming computations \"light\" means, that\nexpansions in a ratio of the light mass versus some\nother mass converges quite quickly. So \"light\ngauginos\" means actually small gaugino mass parameters. This does not imply that all the particles are at the same mass as the parameters. And\nof course, the gluinos g\u0303 and the lightest neutralino\n\u03c7\u030301 will be of the same order as the corresponding\ngaugino mass parameter.\n2.1.1. Charginos\nLet's look for instance at the simple chargino\nmass matrix:\n\u221a\n\u0013\n\u0012\n+\n2mW sin \u03b2\n\u221a mSU(2)\n(1)\nM\u03c7\u0303 =\n2mW cos \u03b2\n\u03bc\nThe term with the W \u2013mass sets the scale for the\n+\nlighter chargino \u03c7\u0303+\n1 . Even when mSU(2) \u2192 0, \u03c7\u03031\nwill be heavier than 45 GeV, provided tan \u03b2 will\nnot become too large, and can nearly become as\nheavy as the W boson, especially for small |\u03bc|,\nsee Figure 1.\n2.1.2. Gluinos\nAlthough there are 8 gluinos, they do not acquire different masses like charginos or neutralinos. Their mass matrix is just the SU (3) gaugino\nmass parameter. So they become massless in the\nlimit of the continuous R\u2013symmetry.\n\n\f2\n\n[GeV]\n\n[GeV]\n\n100\n\nj\n\nm\u001f~+ /GeV\n\n100\n\n\u0016j\n\n45\n\nm\u001f~ /GeV\n0\n2\n\n1\n\nj\n\n\u0016j\n\n40\n\n50\n50\n\n35\n30\n\n50\n\n55\n60\n\n25\n\n65\n\n20\n\n15\n\n70\n0\n1\n\n1.5\n\ntan\n\n2\n\n0\n1\n\n1.5\n\ntan\n\n2\n\nFigure 1. \u03c7\u0303+\n1 mass contours in the |\u03bc|-tan \u03b2 plane\nfor mSU(2) = 0.\n\nFigure 2. \u03c7\u030302 mass contours in the |\u03bc|-tan \u03b2 plane\nfor mU(1) = mSU(2) = 0.\n\n2.1.3. Neutralinos\nFor the neutralinos the situation is more complicated. When both gaugino mass parameters\nthat enter the neutralino mass matrix are exactly\nzero, an exact photino state \u03b3\u0303 with mass zero decouples from the other neutralinos. The situation remains similar, if both mass parameters are\nequal, even if they are not zero. Then one neutralino will be an exact \u03b3\u0303. This \u03b3\u0303 does not couple\nto the the Z boson at all. So all limits that are\nderived from LEP experiments with the analysis\nof the Z peak do not apply. But the second lightest neutralino \u03c7\u030302 becomes then the particle, that\nthe LEP collaborations were looking for - aside\nfrom the fact, that it can decay. One can apply\nnow the limits from LEP to this \u03c7\u030302 . Again tan \u03b2\nis quite important. |\u03bc| works in the opposite direction as with the \u03c7\u0303+\n1 : now the bigger |\u03bc|, the\nheavier \u03c7\u030302 , see Figure 2. For a thorough discussion about the neutralino mass matrix see [7].\n\n\u03b4m\u03bb is only proportional to m3t , so that the corrections are not up to 50 GeV, but only up to 1\nor 2 GeV.\nOne can also expect that the corrections to the\ng\u0303 are bigger than to the \u03b3\u0303 because of the strong\ncoupling. This is the reason, why one expects\nthe \u03b3\u0303 to be the lightest supersymmetric particle\n(LSP) in this scenario.\n\n2.1.4. 1\u2013loop mass corrections\nIt is well known, that the mass corrections to\nthe higgs boson are quite sizeable. As similar\ngraphs are participating, one can expect similar\ncorrections for the gauginos. But there is one big\ndifference to the higgs corrections, where one calculates a \u03b4m2h that is proportional to m4t , whereas\n\n2.2. Why are they not seen yet?\nThis question is more tough, but there are answers and arguments, that can be brought up.\nThe first point is, that these light gauginos really\nescape detection - just like the neutrinos escaped\ndetection for a long time. I will be more specific\nfor each of the gauginos later. The second point\nis, that they can also be misinterpreted as other\nparticles. This argument is used by many people\nfor various other effects, too [8,9]. And there are\nmeasurements, that would favor the existence of\nlight gauginos [5,8,10\u201312], see especially the discussion in [11].\n2.2.1. Charginos\nAs \u03c7\u0303+\n1 is lighter than the W -boson, it must have\nbeen produced by LEP. Looking at the cross section e+ e\u2212 \u2192 X, one expects to see a threshold\n \u0304+\nwhen \u03c7\u0303+\n1 \u03c7\u03031 is pair produced. But since there is\n\n\f3\nno fine spaced energy scan done by LEP above\nthe Z-peak, one can easily miss the threshold. Of\ncourse, there has to be a higher cross section for\n \u0304+\ne+ e\u2212 \u2192 X above the \u03c7\u0303+\n1 \u03c7\u03031 threshold. But how\ndo the LEP experiments calibrate their detectors,\nif not by that cross section, which is assumed to\nbe the standard model one? The comparison to\nthe Monte Carlo Data is done by the same procedure, too. My conclusion: it is possible, that\n \u0304+\nthe pair production of \u03c7\u0303+\n1 \u03c7\u03031 is not clearly visible\njust by looking at the production cross section.\nOk, so lets look into the decays! At least they\nshould be seen in LEP, right? If I take the scenario of tiny gaugino mass parameters for real,\nI will have to look at the signature of \u03c7\u0303+\n1 decay,\nbecause it can be dramatically different from the\nnormal decay. [13] proposes the hadronic decay\n \u0304\n\u03c7\u0303+\n1 \u2192 udg\u0303 to be dominant. That decay would\nthen just increase the hadronic cross section. To\nsee this increase in the hadronic cross section,\none would have to make either a fine spaced energy scan, to see the threshold or to know exactly\nthe expected standard model background. Of\ncourse, the standard model background is quite\nwell known.\nBut what is the procedure, with which the\nhadronic cross section is compared to the theoretical prediction? It is the Monte Carlo studies for the detectors; and they compare to the\nmeasured cross section, making the assumption,\nthat it is the standard model cross section. In\nsome sense this seems to me like a vicious circle.\nBut I also think these complicated procedures are\nnecessary, to extract reliable data from the complicated detectors. And the experimentalists are\ndoing a marvellous job!\n2.2.2. Gluinos\nThe g\u0303 is expected to be very light. As such\na light colored state it will affect the running\nof \u03b1s . This change of running is actually in\nquite good agreement with the measurements\nperformed with q q\u0304 bound states [12,14], but it is\noff for the measurement done at the \u03c4 [15]. Nevertheless, assuming a 10% relativistic correction\nfor the \u03c4 -measurement brings this measurement\nin the correct range for the light gluino prediction. But it needs a 100% correction to bring\n\nthe q q\u0304 bound state measurements into the correct range of the standard model prediction. Of\ncourse, both predictions assume the measurement\nat the Z-peak to be correct.\nThe Aleph collaboration at LEP did an additional study for the running of \u03b1s and the number\nof light flavors [16]. It ruled out a light g\u0303, but this\nstudy was criticized by [17]. Although I don't understand [16] fully, especially since they rely heavily on the Monte Carlo studies and sophisticated\nstatistical techniques, I think they did a good\nwork. But one question remains for me: why did\nthe other LEP collaborations neither confirm nor\ncontradict this analysis?\n2.2.3. Neutralinos\nHere we have to look at two of them: the \u03b3\u0303,\nwhich is assumed to be the LSP, and the \u03c7\u030302 .\nI thought I could ignore the question about the\n\u03b3\u0303 because it will not couple to the Z boson. Actually it will couple exactly the same like an ordinary photon, with the only difference, that one\nof the other particles has to be a SUSY particle.\nSince SUSY particles are quite heavy, i.e. much\nheavier than the normal quarks and leptons, I\nassumed, that the effects would be too small to\nbe seen anyway. But during the workshop I was\nmade aware that there exist dedicated searches\nfor a light \u03b3\u0303 in the low energy e+ e\u2212 cross section\n[18]. But these experimental results do not exclude a light \u03b3\u0303, they just give limits on the mass\nof the scalar electrons. Other restrictions for a\n\u03b3\u0303 can be found from cosmological arguments [19]\nand other inclusive detector measurements [20].\nFor the \u03c7\u030302 the situation is quite complicated.\nOne has to worry not only about the production\n \u0304 02 at the Z peak, one has also to think\nof \u03c7\u030302 \u03c7\u0303\nabout possible decays. Again [13] proposes decay\nmodes into g\u0303 and hadrons. These decay modes\nlook similar to the decays of the \u03c7\u030301 in R-Parity\nviolating models [21,22]. Keep in mind, that LEP\ndid extensive studies for R-Parity violation! But\non the other hand the situation is not the same:\nthere is no simple way to translate limits obtained\nfor R-Parity violating models into limits for this\nhadronic \u03c7\u030302 decay, since one of the main features\nof the R-Parity violating models can be the enhancement in the lepton multiplicity [22]. But\n\n\f4\nthe hadronic decay of \u03c7\u030302 will reduce the lepton\nmultiplicity.\n2.2.4. My opinion on light gauginos\nWhenever I asked experimentalists about excluding the light gaugino scenario by experimental data, I got the answer, \"We would have to\nmake a dedicated study\". Only G. Dissertori gave\na definite answer. So I - for myself - cannot\nrule out that light gaugino scenario. And in addition, there are some problems, where light gauginos offer a solution.\n2.3. Motivation for light gauginos\nWhen one looks at the unconstrained MSSM\nthat has all soft breaking parameters with arbitrary phases, one will immediately have problems\nwith existing measurements on CP violating variables and on flavor changing processes. The usual\nway to handle this kind of situation is to apply\nconstraints on the parameters, either by using\nrenormalization group equations with restrictive\nboundary conditions or applying low energy symmetry arguments like \"alignment\" [23,24].\nOn the other hand, light gauginos are another\nway of suppressing many of the problematic diagrams that give too big results for CP violating\nobservables. [6] has quantified this argument for\nthe electric dipole moments (EDMs) of electron\nand neutron. In [24] one can see the vanishing of\nthe SUSY effects in K 0 -K\u0304 0 mixing with vanishing gaugino masses. [25] has demonstrated this\nvanishing also for a top quark mass of 175 GeV.\nOne motivation for me to look for light gauginos is, that almost everybody seems inclined to\nconsider the relevant parameter space to be already ruled out, but no one could really convince\nme about that.\n3. Electric dipole moments\nThe second big question I wanted to present in\nthe workshop was about EDM measurements. It\ncan be brought to the point, that I have doubts\nabout the prerogatives that are assumed when a\nmacroscopic measurement is compared to calculations that involve questions of low energy QCD.\nMy feeling was - and is to some extent even now\n- that the accuracy of the QCD related topics\n\nis not the same as the claimed accuracy of the\nexperiments that measure the EDMs: do we really know atomic or nuclear physics to the precision of 10\u221212 , which is the inherent precision of\nthe EDMs. A discussion about that point with\nMaxim Pospelov during the workshop was very\nhelpful for me.\n3.1. EDM of the neutron\nThe basic question about the calculation of the\nEDM of the neutron dN is, how one can combine the result of the various contributions of the\nparticles, that make up the neutron. The first estimates were based on the non-relativistic SU(6)\nquark model with\ndN = (4/3)dd \u2212 (1/3)du .\n\n(2)\n\nAnd the other QCD contributions to dN were estimated by a Naive Dimensional Analysis [26].\nDifferent estimates were made in [27] and a few\nmonths ago I found even another proposal [28].\nThis multitude of possible models, that give opposite results for dN - as has been shown in [29]\n- shows that the theoretical part of the measurements is not really under control. So any restriction derived from the non measurement of dN can\njust be applied if one makes additional assumptions that are not part of the MSSM.\nIn the workshop I was made aware of more accurate calculations for the composition of the neutron [30], see the discussion in [31]. A new estimate of the chromoelectric contribution has been\nobtained in [32]. So some part of my criticism of\nthe neutron EDM has lost its basis. But the possibility of cancellations is still present. And the\npoints in parameter space where these cancellations take place depend on the specific assumptions about the neutron.\n3.2. EDM of the electron\nIn contrast to dN the EDM of the electron de\nis easy to calculate and theoretically fully under\ncontrol. The problematic point comes with the\nmeasurement, because a direct measurement with\nfree electrons seems to be impossible. One argument for the impossibility is the charge of the\nelectron.\nThe usual way is to measure atomic quantities\nand to relate them to de . The most accurate mea-\n\n\f5\nsurements today are done with da (205 Tl; 6 2 P1/2 )\n[33]. The relevant calculations were done in\n[34], pointing out, that dTl has four sources\nand only one of them is the intrinsic de . The\nother three are (1) an intrinsic nucleon EDM, (2)\nP, T -odd nucleon-nucleon interaction, (3) P, T odd electron-nucleon interaction. Non measurement of dTl requires the sum of all four sources\nto be smaller than the experimental limit.\nTo derive a limit on de from the dTl measurement one has to assume, that all other three contributions are much smaller then the first. Of\ncourse, the probability that two of these four contributions cancel each other is very small. But on\nthe other hand: more contributions mean more\npossibilities for cancellations.\n3.3. EDM of 199 Hg\nI was made aware of this type of measurement,\nthat restricts the parameters of the MSSM, by\nToby Falk during SUSY99 and then later again\nby Maxim Pospelov at this workshop, see their\narticle [31].\nAs it uses again atomic and nuclear physics to\nrelate the measurement to the EDMs of the constituents of the atom, my uneasy feeling about\nthe accuracy remains. But it is another argument, that has to be taken into account. Any\nmodel should describe all phenomena that are\nencountered in nature, so it should explain the\nnon-measurement of dHg , too.\n4. My conclusions\n\". . . the supersymmetry algebra is the only\ngraded Lie algebra of symmetries of the S-matrix\nconsistent with relativistic quantum field theory\"\n[35]. This citation reflects the major motivation\nfor SUSY. Since we live in a world where masses\nare nonzero, it is necessary that SUSY is broken.\nBut this breaking of SUSY introduces a lot of new\nparameters in the low energy Lagrangian, that are\nconstrained by stability requirements and their\neffect on measurements.\nStability requirements just restrict the parameters in a way, that the vacuum of the model is\ncompatible with what we see in everyday life: we\ndon't see any electric or colored net charge in the\n\nvacuum. And we see that particles are massive,\nbut not superheavy (of order of the Planck mass).\nAnd we see, that the electro-weak symmetry is\nbroken to the electric charge. So the vacuum\nof SUSY has to fulfill these constraints, which it\ndoes easily enough with the mechanism of spontaneous symmetry breaking in the electro-weak\nsector.\nBut there are a lot of other effects, that wait\nfor an explanation: we see a large baryon asymmetry in the universe (BAU), but the vacuum of\nthe Lagrangian of the MSSM looks symmetric between baryons and antibaryons. And the proton\nis quite stable, too. And we also find, that CP\nviolation is quite small. Actually, the only visible\neffect up to now is observed in the neutral kaon\nsector [36].\nFor the explanation of BAU one needs quite\na large CP violating phase [37], but other measurements, like the EDMs, can be interpreted as\nrestricting these possible phases - or at least specific combinations of them. Another usual interpretation is, that the masses of the SUSY particles are so heavy, that their effect in the EDMs\nare suppressed. But having very heavy SUSY\nparticles makes the explanation of the observed\nvacuum more difficult.\nAnother interpretation for the non-observation\nof EDMs can be light gauginos [6]. It also allows\nthe other SUSY particles to stay \"light\" and helps\ntherefore in the explanation of the electro-weak\nsymmetry breaking. The \"cost\" for this interpretation is, that one is away from the mainstream\nof model building. And one has to investigate\ncarefully, if other measurements will not rule out\nthis scenario.\nREFERENCES\n1. H. P. Nilles, Phys. Rept. 110 (1984) 1;\nH. E. Haber and G. L. Kane, Phys.
