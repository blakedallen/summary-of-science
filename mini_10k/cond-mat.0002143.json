INTRODUCTION AND MOTIVATION\n\nThe aim of statistical mechanics is to relate the macroscopic observables to the microscopic properties of the\nsystem. Before attempting any such derivation one always has to specify the spectrum of length-scales the analysis\nwill comprise: while 'macroscopic' is usually defined in a unique way by the every-day-life length scale, the 'microscopic'\nis never so obvious, and the choice of the best lower-end scale is highly non-universal, it is system dependent, usually\nleft to our physical 'intuition', or it is set by the limitations of the experimental instrumentation. It is obvious that\nin order to derive the laws of the gaseous matter we do not need to employ the physics of elementary particles,\nit is enough to start from an effective microscopic model (or Hamiltonian) on the level of molecular interactions.\nThen starting from the equations of motion on the microscopic level and using a statistic and probabilistic approach,\nthe macroscale physics is derived. In this 'long wavelength' approach most of the microscopic, or short wavelength\ninformation is usually redundant and it is scaled away.\nSometimes however, microscopic quantities are important and directly contribute to macroscopic observables, e.g.,\nthe nearest-neighbor correlations in driven systems determine the current, in model B the mobility, in kinetic Ising\nmodel the domain-wall velocity, in parallel computation the utilization (efficiency) of conservative parallel algorithms,\netc. Once a lower length scale is set on which we can define an effective microscopic dynamics, it becomes meaningful\nto ask questions about local properties at this length scale, e.g. nearest neighbor correlations, contour distributions,\nextremal-point densities, etc. These quantities are obviously not universal, however their behavior against the variation\nof the length scales can present qualitative and universal features. Here we study the dynamics of macroscopically\nrough surfaces via investigating an intriguing miscroscopic quantity: the density of extrema (minima) and its finite\nsize effects. We derive a number of analytical results about these quantities for a large class of non-equilibrium surface\nfluctuations described by linear Langevin equations, and solid-on-solid (SOS) lattice-growth models. Besides their\nobvious relevance to surface physics our technique can be used to show [1] the asymptotic scalability of conservative\nmassively parallel algorithms for discrete-event simulation, i.e., the fact that the efficiency of such computational\nschemes does not vanish with increasing the number of processing elements, but it has a lower non-trivial bound.\nThe solution of this problem is not only of practical importance from the point of view of parallel computing, but it\nhas important consequences for our understanding of systems with asynchronous parallel dynamics, in general. There\nare numerous dynamical systems both man-made, and found in the nature, that contain a \"substantial amount\" of\nparallelism. For example,\n1) in wireless cellular communications the call arrivals and departures are happening in continuos time (Poisson\narrivals), and the discrete events (call arrivals) are not synchronized by a global clock. Nevertheless, calls initiated in\ncells substantially far from each other can be processed simultaneously by the parallel simulator without changing the\npoissonian nature of the underlying process. The problem of designing efficient dynamic channel allocation schemes\nfor wireless networks is a very difficult one and currently it is done by modelling the network as a system of interacting\ncontinuous time stochastic automata on parallel architectures [2].\n2) in magnetic systems the discrete events are the spin flip attempts (e.g., Glauber dynamics for Ising systems).\nWhile traditional single spin flip dynamics may seem inherently serial, systems with short range interactions can\n\n1\n\n\fbe simulated in parallel: spins far from each other with different local simulated times can be updated simultaneously. Fast and efficient parallel Monte-Carlo algorithms are extremely welcome when studying metastable decay and\nhysteresis of kinetic Ising ferromagnets below their critical temperature, see [3] and references therein.\n3) financial markets, and especially the stock market is an extremely dynamic, high connectivity network of relations,\nthousands of trades are being made asynchronously every minute.\n4) the brain. The human brain, in spite of its low weight of approx. 1kg, and volume of 1400 cm3 , it contains\nabout 100 billion neurons, each neuron being connected through synapses to approximately 10,000 other neurons.\nThe total number of synapses in a human brain is about 1000 trillion (1015 ). The neurons of a single human brain\nplaced end-to-end would make a \"string\" of an enourmous lenght: 250,000 miles [4]. Assuming that each neuron of a\nsingle human cortex can be in two states only (resting or acting), the total number of different brain configurations\n11\nwould be 210 . According to Carl Sagan, this number is greater than the total number of protons and electrons of\nthe known universe, [4]. The brain does an incredible amount of parallel computation: it simultaneously manages all\nof our body functions, we can talk and walk at the same time, etc.\n5) evolution of networks such as the internet, has parallel dynamics: the local network connectivity changes concurrently as many sites are attached or removed in different locations. As a matter of fact the physics of such dynamic\nnetworks is a currently heavily investigated and a rapidly emerging field [5].\nIn order to present the basic ideas and notions in the simplest way, in the following we will restrict ourselves to one\ndimensional interfaces that have no overhangs. The restriction on the overhangs may actually be lifted with a proper\nparametrization of the surface, a problem to which we will return briefly in the concluding section. The first visual\nimpression when we look at a rough surface h(x, t) is the extent of the fluctuations perpendicular to the substrate, in\nother words, the width of the fluctuations. The width (or the rms of the height h of the fluctuations) is probably the\nmost extensively studied quantity in interface physics, due to the fact that its definition is simply quantifiable and\ntherefore measurable:\nr\nh\ni\nw(L, t) =\n\n2\n\n[h(x, t)] \u2212 h(x, t)\n\n2\n\n,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere the overline denotes the average over the substrate. It is well-known that this quantity characterizes the\nlong wavelength behavior of the fluctuations, the high frequency components being averaged out in (1). The short\nwavelength end of the spectrum has been ignored in the literature mainly because of its non-universal character, and\nalso because it seemed to lack such a simple quantifiable definition as the width w.\nIn the following we will present a quantity that is almost as simple and intuitive as the width w but it characterizes\nthe high frequency components of the fluctuations and it is simply quantifiable. For illustrative purposes let us\nconsider the classic Weierstrass function defined as the M \u2192 \u221e limit of the smooth functions WM (a, b; x):\nW (a, b; x) = lim WM (a, b; x) = lim\nM\u2192\u221e\n\nM\u2192\u221e\n\nM\nX\n\na\u2212m cos (bm x) , a, b > 1\n\n(2)\n\nm=0\n\nFigure 1a shows the graph of WM at a = 2 and b = 3 (arbitrary values) for M = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 in the interval x \u2208 [0, 4\u03c0].\nAs one can see, by increasing M we are adding more and more detail to the graph of the function on finer and finer\nlength-scales. Thus M plays the role of a regulator for the microscopic cut-off length which is b\u2212M , and for M = \u221e\nand b > a, the function becomes nowhere differentiable as it was shown by Hardy [6].\nComparing the graphs of WM for lower M values with those for higher M -s we observe that the width effectively\ndoes not change, however the curves look qualitatively very different. This is obvious from (2): adding an extra\nterm will not change the long wavelength modes, but adds a higher frequency component to the Fourier spectrum\nof the graph. We need to operationally define a quantifiable parameter which makes a distinction between a much\n'fuzzier' graph, such as M = 4 and a smoother one, such as M = 1. The natural choice based on Figure 1a is the\nnumber of local minima (or extrema) in the graph of function. In Figure 1b we present the number of local minima\nuM vs. M for two different values of b, b = 2.8 and b = 1.8, while keeping a at the same value of a = 2. For all b\nvalues (not only for these two) the leading behaviour is exponential: uM \u223c \u03bbM . The inset in Figure 1b shows the\ndependence of the rate \u03bb as a function of b for fixed a. We observe that for b > a, \u03bb = b, but below b = a the\ndependence crosses over to another, seemingly linear function. For b > a the amplitude of the extra added term in\nWM+1 is large enough to prevent the cancellation of the newly appearing minima by the drop in the local slope of\nWM . At b \u2264 a the number of cancelled extrema starts to increase drastically with an exponential trend, leading to\nthe crossover seen in the inset of Figure 2b. It has been shown that the fractal dimension of the Weierstrass function\nfor b > a is given by D0 = ln b/ ln a [7], [8]. For b \u2264 a the Weierstrass curve becomes non-fractal with a dimension\nof D0 = 1. By varying b with respect to a, we are crossing a fractal-smooth transition at b = a. The very intriguing\nobservation we just come across is that even though we are in the smooth regime (b < a) the density of minima is\n2\n\n\fstill a diverging quantity (the b = 1.8 curve in Figure 1b). It is thus possible to have an infinite number of 'wrinkles'\nin the Weierstrass function without having a diverging length, without having a fractal in the classical sense. The\ntransition from fractal to smooth, as b is lowered appears as a non-analyticity in the divergence rate of the curve's\nwrinkledness. A rigorous analytic treatment of this problem seems to be highly non-trivial and we propose it as an\nopen question to the interested reader.\n100000\n\na)\n10000\n\nM=4\n1000\n\nuM\n\nWM (2,3;x)\n\nM=3\nM=2\n\n100\n\nM=1\n\n10\n\n3.5\n3\n\n1\n\n\u03bb\n\n2.5\n\nM=0\n\n2\n\n1\n\n5/3\n1.5\n1\n\n0.1\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\n\n1.5\n\n0\n\nx\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\n\n2\n\n14\n\nb\n\n2.5\n\n16\n\n3\n\n18\n\n20\n\nM\n\nFIG. 1. a) the function WM (a, b; x) at a = 2, b = 3 and M = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. b) The scaling uM \u223c \u03bbM of the number of local\nminima for b = 2.8 (plusses) and b = 1.8 (crosses). The inset shows \u03bb vs. b while keeping a constant, a = 2.\n\nThe simple example shown above suggests that there is novel and non-trivial physics lying behind the analysis of\nextremal point densities, and it gives extra information on the morphology of interfaces. Given an interface h(x, t), we\npropose a quantitative form that characterizes the density of minima via a 'partition-function' like expression, which\nis hardly more complex than Eq. (1) and gives an alternate description of the surface morphology:\nuq (L, [h]) =\n\n1X\nq\n[K(xi )] ,\nL i\n\nq > 0 , xi are non-degenerate minima of h\n\n(3)\n\nwith K(xi ) denoting the curvature of h at the local (non-degenerate) minimum point xi . The variable q can be\nconceived as 'inverse temperature'. Obviously, for q = 0 we obtain the number of local minima per unit interface\nlength. The rigorous mathematical description and definitions lying at the basis of (3) is being presented in Section\nIV. The quantity in Eq. (3) is reminiscent to the partition function used in the definition of the thermodynamical\nformalism of one dimensional chaotic maps [9] and also to the definition of the dynamical or R\u00e9nyi entropies of these\nchaotic maps. In that case, however the curvatures at the minima are replaced by cylinder intervals and/or the visiting\nprobabilities of these cylinders.\nWe present a detailed analysis for the above quantity in case of a large class of linear Langevin equations of type\n\u2202h/\u2202t = \u2212\u03bd(\u2212\u22072 h)z/2 + \u03b7(x, t), where \u03b7 is a Gaussian noise term, and z a positive real number. These Langevin\nequations are found to describe faithfully the fluctuations of monoatomic steps on various substrates, see for a review\nRef. [13]. One of the interesting conclusions we came to by studying the extremal-point densities on such equations is\nthat depending on the value of z the typical surface morphology can be fractal, or locally smooth, and the two regimes\nare separated by a critical z value, zc . In the fractal case, the interface will have infinitely many minima and cusps\njust as in the case of the nondifferentiable Weierstrass function (2), and the extremal point densities become infinite,\nor if the problem is discretized onto a lattice with spacing a, a power-law diverging behavior is observed as a \u2192 0+\nfor these densities. This sudden change of the 'intrinsic roughness' may be conceived as a phase transition even in an\nexperimental situation. Changing a parameter, such as the temperature, the law describing the fluctuations can change\nsince the mechanism responsible for the fluctuations can change character as the temperature varies. For example,\nit has been recently shown using Scanning Tunneling Microscope (STM) measurements [10], that the fluctuations of\nsingle atom layer steps on Cu (111) below T = 300 o C correspond to the perifery diffusion mechanism (z = 4), but\nabove this temperature (such as T = 500 o C in their measurements) the mechanism is attachement-detachment where\nz = 2, see also Ref. [11,12].\nThe paper is organized as follows: In Sections II and III we define and investigate on several well known on-lattice\nmodels the minimum point density and derive exact results in the steady-state (t \u2192 \u221e) including finite size effects. As\n3\n\n\fa practical application of these on-lattice results, we briefly present in Subsection III.B a lattice surface-growth model\nwhich exactly describes the evolution of the simulated time-horizon for conservative massively parallel schemes in\nparallel computation, and solve a long-standing asymptotic scalability question for these update schemes. In Section\nIV we lay down a more rigorous mathematical treatment for extremal point densities, and stochastic extremal point\ndensities on the continuum, with a detailed derivation for a large class of linear Langevin equations (which are in fact\nthe continuum counterparts of the discrete ones from Section II). The more rigorous treatment allows for an exact\nanalytical evaluation not only in the steady-state, but for all times! We identify novel characteristic dimensions that\nseparate regimes with divergent extremal point densities from convergent ones and which give a novel understanding\nof the short wavelength physics behind these kinetic roughening processes.\nII. LINEAR SURFACE GROWTH MODELS ON THE LATTICE\n\nIn the present Section we focus on discrete, one dimensional models from the linear theory of kinetic roughening\n[14,18]. Let us consider a one dimensional substrate consisting of L lattice sites, with periodic boundary conditions.\nFor simplicity the lattice constant is taken as unity, which clearly, represents the lower cut-off length for the effective\nequation of motion. For the moment let us study the discretized counterpart of the general Langevin equation that\ndescribes the linear theory of Molecular Beam Epitaxy (MBE) [15,16]:\n\u2202t hi (t) = \u03bd\u22072 hi (t) \u2212 \u03ba\u22074 hi (t) + \u03b7i (t) ,\n\n(4)\n\nwhere \u03b7i (t) is Gaussian white noise with\nh\u03b7i (t)\u03b7i (t\u2032 )i = 2D \u03b4i,j \u03b4(t \u2212 t\u2032 ) ,\n\n(5)\n\nand \u22072 is the discrete Laplacian operator, i.e., \u22072 fj = fj+1 + fj\u22121 \u2212 2fj , applied to an arbitrary lattice function fj .\nThis equation arrises in MBE with both surface diffusion mechanism (the 4th order, or curvature term) and desorption\nmechanism (the 2nd order, or diffusive term) present and it has been studied extensively by several authors [15,17].\nStability requires \u03bd \u2265 0 and \u03ba \u2265 0 (as a matter of fact, on the lattice is enough to have \u03bd > 0 and \u03ba \u2265 \u2212\u03bd/2). Starting\nfrom a completely flat initial condition, the interface roughens until the correlation length \u03be reaches the size of the\nsystem \u03be \u2243 L, when the roughening saturates\np over into a steady-state regime. The process of kinetic roughening is\ncontrolled by the intrinsic length scale [17], \u03ba/\u03bd. Below this lengthscale the roughening is dominated by the surface\ndiffusion or Mullins [19] term (the 4th order operator) but above it is characterized by the evaporation piece (the\ndiffusion) or Edwards-Wilkinson [20] term. Since eq. (4) is translationaly invariant and linear in h it can be solved\nvia the discrete Fourier-transform:\nh\u0303k =\n\nL\u22121\nX\n\ne\u2212ikj hi , k =\n\nj=0\n\n2\u03c0n\n, n = 0, 1, 2, . . . , L \u2212 1 .\nL\n\n(6)\n\nThen eq. (4) translates into\n\nwith\n\n\u0003\n\u0002\n\u2202t h\u0303k (t) = \u2212 2\u03bd(1 \u2212 cos(k)) + 4\u03ba(1 \u2212 cos(k))2 h\u0303k (t) + \u03b7\u0303k (t) ,\n\n(7)\n\nh\u03b7\u0303k (t)\u03b7\u0303k\u2032 (t\u2032 )i = 2DL \u03b4(k+k\u2032 ) mod 2\u03c0,0 \u03b4(t \u2212 t\u2032 )\n\n(8)\n\nFollowing the definition of the equal-time structure factor for S(k, t), namely\nS h (k, t)L\u03b4(k+k\u2032 ) mod 2\u03c0,0 \u2261 hh\u0303k (t)h\u0303k\u2032 (t)i ,\n\n(9)\n\none obtains for an initially flat interface:\n\nIn the above equation\n\n\u0011\n\u0010\n2\nS h (k, t) = S h (k) 1 \u2212 e\u2212(4\u03bd(1\u2212cos(k))+8\u03ba(1\u2212cos(k)) )t .\nS h (k) \u2261 lim S h (k, t) =\nt\u2192\u221e\n\nD\n2\u03bd(1 \u2212 cos(k)) + 4\u03ba(1 \u2212 cos(k))2\n4\n\n(10)\n\n(11)\n\n\fis the steady-state structure factor.\np\nFor \u03bd 6= 0, and in the asymptotic scaling limit where L \u226b \u03ba/\u03bd, the model belongs to the EW universality\n2\nclass and the roughening exponent is \u03b1 = 1/2 (it is defined through the scaling L2\u03b1 of the interface width hwL\n(t)i =\nPL\n2\n(1/L)h i=1 [hi (t) \u2212 h] i in the steady state). The presence of the curvature term does not change the universal scaling\nproperties for the surface width, and one finds the same exponents as for the pure EW (\u03ba = 0) case in eq. (4). For\n\u03bd = 0 the surface is purely curvature driven (z = 4) and the model belongs to a different universality class where the\nsteady-state width scales with a roughness exponent of \u03b1 = 3/2.\nIn the following we will be mostly interested in some local steady-state properties of the surface hi . In particular, we\nwant to find the density of local minima for the surface described by (4). The operator which measures this quantity\nis\nL\n\nu=\n\n1X\n\u0398(hi\u22121 \u2212 hi )\u0398(hi+1 \u2212 hi ) .\nL i=1\n\n(12)\n\nThis expression motivates the introduction of the local slopes, \u03c6i = hi+1 \u2212 hi . In this representation the operator for\nthe density of local minima (for the original surface) is\nL\n\n1X\n\u0398(\u2212\u03c6i\u22121 )\u0398(\u03c6i ) ,\nL i=1\n\nu=\n\n(13)\n\nand its steady-state average is hui = h\u0398(\u2212\u03c6i\u22121 )\u0398(\u03c6i )i = h\u0398(\u2212\u03c61 )\u0398(\u03c62 )i, due to translational invariance. The average\ndensity of local minima is the same as the probability that at a randomly chosen site of the lattice the surface exhibits\na local minimum. It is governed by the nearest-neighbor two-slope distribution, which is also Gaussian and fully\ndetermined by h\u03c621 i = h\u03c622 i and h\u03c61 \u03c62 i:\nnn\n\n1\n\nP nn (\u03c61 , \u03c62 ) \u221d e\u2212 2 \u03c6j Ajk \u03c6k , j, k = 1, 2 ,\n\n(14)\n\nwhere\nnn\n\nA\n\n=\n\n\u0012\n\nh\u03c621 i h\u03c61 \u03c62 i\nh\u03c61 \u03c62 i h\u03c621 i\n\n\u0013\u22121\n\nAs we derive in Appendix A, the density of local minima only depends on the ratio h\u03c61 \u03c62 i/h\u03c621 i:\n\u0013\n\u0012\nh\u03c61 \u03c62 i\n1\n.\narccos\nhui =\n2\u03c0\nh\u03c621 i\n\n(15)\n\n(16)\n\nFinite-size effects of hui are obviously carried through those of the correlations. First we find the steady-state structure\nfactor for the slopes. Since \u03c6\u0303k = (1 \u2212 e\u2212ik )h\u0303k , we have S \u03c6 (k) = 2(1 \u2212 cos(k))S h (k). Then from (11) one obtains:\nS \u03c6 (k) =\n\nD\n, for k 6= 0 , and S \u03c6 (k) = 0 , for k = 0 .\n\u03bd + 2\u03ba(1 \u2212 cos(k))\n\nThe former automatically follows from the\nCL\u03c6 (l)\n\nPL\n\ni=1\n\n(17)\n\n\u03c6i = 0 relation. Then we obtain the slope-slope correlations\n\n\u0012\n\u0013\nL\u22121\n1 X i 2\u03c0n l \u03c6 2\u03c0n\nL\n\u2261 h\u03c6i \u03c6i+l i =\nS\n.\ne\nL n=1\nL\n\n(18)\n\nWith the help of Poisson summation formulas, in Appendix B we show a derivation for the exact spatial correlation\nfunction, which yields\n\u001b\n\u001a\n1 1\nD\nb|l|\nbL bl + b\u2212l\n\u221a\n\u221a\n, |l| \u2264 L ,\n(19)\n\u2212\nCL\u03c6 (l) =\n+\n\u03bd + 2\u03ba\n1 \u2212 a L 1 \u2212 b L 1 \u2212 a2\n1 \u2212 a2\nwith\na\u2261\n\n\u221a\n1 \u2212 1 \u2212 a2\n2\u03ba\n, and b \u2261\n.\n\u03bd + 2\u03ba\na\n5\n\n(20)\n\n\fWe have |a| \u2264 1 and b \u2264 1. The second term in the bracket in (19) gives a uniform power law correction, while\nthe third one gives an exponential correction to the correlation function in the thermodynamic limit. For \u03bd 6= 0 and\nL \u2192 \u221e one obtains\n\u03c6\n\n\u03c6\nC\u221e\n(l) =\n\nb|l|\nD e\u2212|l|/\u03be\u221e\nD\n\u221a\n\u221a\n=\n\u03bd + 2\u03ba 1 \u2212 a2\n\u03bd + 2\u03ba 1 \u2212 a2\n\n(21)\n\nwhere we define the correlation length of the slopes for an infinite system as:\n1\n\u03c6\n\u03be\u221e\n\u2261\u2212\n.\nln(b)\n\n(22)\n\u03bd\u21920\n\n\u03c6\nIn the \u03bd \u2192 0 limit it becomes the intrinsic correlation length which diverges as \u03bd \u22121/2 : \u03be\u221e\n\u2243\n\u0012r\n\u0013\n\u0001\n\u03ba\nD \u03c6\n\u03bd\u21920 D\n\u03c6\n\u03be\u221e \u2212 |l| .\n\u2212 |l| \u2243\nC\u221e\n(l) \u2243\n2\u03ba\n\u03bd\n2\u03ba\n\np\n\u03ba/\u03bd and\n\n(23)\n\nIn this limit the slopes (separated by any finite distance) become highly correlated, and one may start to anticipate\nthat the density of local minima will vanish for the original surface {hi }. In the following two subsections we investigate\nthe density of local minima and its finite-size effects for the Edwards-Wilkinson and the Mullins cases.\nA. Density of local minima for Edwards-Wilkinson term dominated regime\n\nTo study the finite size effects for the local minimum density, we neglect the exponentially small correction in (19),\n\u03c6\nso in the asymptotic limit, where L \u226b \u03be\u221e\n, CL\u03c6 (l) decays exponentially with uniform finite-size corrections:\n\u001a\n\u001b\nb|l|\nD\n1 1\n\u221a\n(24)\nCL\u03c6 (l) \u2243\n\u2212\n\u03bd + 2\u03ba\n1\u2212aL\n1 \u2212 a2\n\nThis holds for the special case \u03ba = 0 as well, (in fact, there the exponential correction exatly vanishes) leaving\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\nD\n\u03c6\n\u03b4l,0 \u2212\n.\n(25)\nCL (l) =\n\u03bd\nL\nNow, emplying eq. (16), we can obtain the density of minima as:\n!\nr\nr\nCL\u03c6 (1)\n1\n1\u2212b 1+a 1\n1\n1\nhuiL =\n\u2243\narccos\narccos(b) +\n,\n2\u03c0\n2\u03c0\n2\u03c0 1 + b 1 \u2212 a L\nCL\u03c6 (0)\n\nAgain, for the \u03ba = 0 case one has a compact exact expression and the corresponding large L behavior:\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1\n1\n1\n1 1\nhuiL =\n\u2243 +\narccos \u2212\n,\n2\u03c0\nL\u22121\n4 2\u03c0 L\n\n(26)\n\n(27)\n\nwhich can also be obtained by taking the \u03ba \u2192 0 limit in (26). To summarize, as long as \u03bd 6= 0, the model belongs to\nthe EW universality class, and in the steady state, the density of local minima behaves as\nconst.\nhuiL \u2243 hui\u221e +\n,\n(28)\nL\nwhere hui\u221e is the value of the density of local minima in the thermodynamic limit:\n1\narccos(b) .\n(29)\nhui\u221e =\n2\u03c0\nNote that this quantity can be small, but does not vanish if \u03bd is close but not equal to 0. Further, the system exhibits\n\u03c6\nthe scaling (28) for asymptotically large systems, where L \u226b \u03be\u221e\n. It is important to see in detail how hui\u221e behaves\nas \u03bd \u2192 0:\n\u221a\nr \u0013\n\u0012 r \u00131/2\n\u0012\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u221a \u221a\n1\n\u03bd\n\u03bd\n2 1\n1\n\u03bd\u21920 1\nq\n.\n(30)\n\u2243\n2\narccos 1 \u2212 2 1 \u2212 a \u2243\narccos 1 \u2212\n\u2243\nhui\u221e \u2243\n2\u03c0\n2\u03c0\n\u03ba\n2\u03c0\n\u03ba\n2\u03c0\n\u03c6\n\u03be\u221e\n\nThus, the density of local minima for an infinite system vanishes as we approach the purely curvature driven (\u03bd \u2192 0)\n\u03c6\nlimit. Simply speaking, the local slopes become \"infinitely\" correlated, such that C\u221e\n(l) diverges [according to eq.\n\u03c6\n\u03c6\n(23)], and the ratio C\u221e\n(l)/C\u221e\n(0) for any fixed l tends to 1. This is the physical picture behind the vanishing density\nof local minima.\n6\n\n\fB. Density of local minima for the Mullins term dominated regime\n\nHere we take the \u03bd \u2192 0 limit first and then study the finite size effects in the purely curvature driven model. The\nslope correlations are finite for finite L as can be seen from eq. (18), since the n = 0 term is not included in the sum!\nThus, in the exact closed formula (19) a careful limiting procedure has to be taken which indeed yields the internal\ncancellation of the apparently divergent terms. Then one obtains the exact slope correlations for the \u03bd = 0 case:\n\u001a \u0012\n\u0013\u001b\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1\n|l|\nD L\n\u03c6\n1 \u2212 2 \u2212 |l| 1 \u2212\n(31)\nCL (l) =\n2\u03ba 6\nL\nL\nand for the local minimum density:\n\u0013 \u221a\n\u0012\n6\n3 1\n1\n\u221a\n\u2243\narccos 1 \u2212\nhuiL =\n2\u03c0\nL+1\n\u03c0 L\n\n(32)\n\nIt vanishes in the thermodynamic limit, and hence, one observes that the limits \u03bd \u2192 0 and L \u2192 \u221e are interchangable.\nFor \u03bd = 0, L is directly associated with the correlation length and we can define \u03beL\u03c6 \u2261 L/6. Then the correlations and\nthe density of local minima takes the same scaling form as eqs. (23) and (30):\nCL\u03c6 (l) \u2243\nand\n\n\u0011\nD \u0010 \u03c6\n\u03beL \u2212 |l| ,\n2\u03ba\n\nhuiL \u2243\n\n\u221a\n\n2 1\nq .\n2\u03c0\n\u03beL\u03c6\n\n(33)\n\n(34)\n\nC. Scaling considerations for higher order equations\n\nLet us now consider another equation but with a generalized relaxational term that includes the Edwards Wilkinson\nand the noisy Mullins equation as particluar cases:\n\u2202t hi (t) = \u2212\u03bd \u2212\u22072\n\n\u0001z/2\n\nh + \u03b7i (t) .\n\n(35)\n\nwhere z is a positive real number (not necessarily integer). Other z values of experimental interest are z = 1, relaxation\nthrough plastic flow, [19,18]), and z = 3 terrace-diffusion mechanism [11\u201313]. For early times, such that t \u226a Lz , the\n2\ninterface width hwL\n(t)i increases with time as\n2\nhwL\n(t)i \u223c t2\u03b2 ,\n\n(36)\n\nwhere \u03b2 = (z \u2212 1)/2z [14,18]. In the t \u2192 \u221e limit, where t \u226b Lz , the interface width saturates for a finite system,\n2\nbut diverges with L according to hwL\n(\u221e)i \u223c L2\u03b1 where \u03b1 = (z \u2212 1)/2 is the roughness exponent [14,18].\nFor z = 4 (curvature driven interface) we saw that the slope fluctuation behaves as CL\u03c6 (0) = h\u03c62i i \u223c L. For higher\nz for the slope-slope correlation function one can deduce\nCL\u03c6 (l) =\n\n2\u03c0n\nL\u22121\nDX\nei L l\n.\nL n=1 \u03bd \u00022 1 \u2212 cos 2\u03c0n \u0001\u0001\u0003 z\u22122\n2\nL\n\n(37)\n\nIt is divergent in the L \u2192 \u221e limit, as a result of infinitely small wave-vectors \u223c 1/L, and we can see that\nCL\u03c6 (0) \u223c Lz\u22123 .\n\n(38)\n\nIt is also useful to define the slope difference correlation function\nG\u03c6L (l) \u2261 h(\u03c6i+l \u2212 \u03c6i )2 i\n\n7\n\n(39)\n\n\ffor which one can write\nG\u03c6L (l)\n\nL\u22121\n2 1 \u2212 cos\nDX\n=\n\u0002\nL n=1 \u03bd 2 1 \u2212 cos\n\n2\u03c0n\nL l\n2\u03c0n\nL\n\n\u0001\u0001\n\n.\n\u0001\u0001\u0003 z\u22122\n2\n\n(40)\n\nFor the small wave-vector behavior we can again deduce that for z > 5\nG\u03c6L (l) \u223c Lz\u22125 l2 .\n\n(41)\n\nOne may refer to this form as \"anomalous\" scaling [18] for the slope difference correlation function in the following\nsense. For z < 5 the scaling form for G\u03c6L (l) follows that of CL\u03c6 (0) [eq. (38)], i.e., G\u03c6L (l) \u223c lz\u22123 . For z > 5 [eq. (41)] it\nobviously features a different l dependence and an additional power of L, and it diverges in the L \u2192 \u221e limit.\nHaving these scaling functions for large L, we can easily obtain the scaling behavior for the average density of local\nminima. Exploiting the identity\n1\nCL\u03c6 (l) = CL\u03c6 (0) \u2212 G\u03c6L (l)\n2\nwe use the general form for the local minimum density:\n!\n!\n\u0013\n\u0012\nCL\u03c6 (1)\n1\n1\n1\n1 G\u03c6L (1)\nconst.\n1\n=\n\u2243\n\u223c\narccos\narccos\n1\n\u2212\narccos\n1\n\u2212\nhui =\n2\u03c0\n2\u03c0\n2 CL\u03c6 (0)\n2\u03c0\nL2\nL\nCL\u03c6 (0)\n\n(42)\n\n(43)\n\nNote that this is the scaling behavior for all z > 5. It simply shows the trivial lower bound for hui: since there is\nalways at least one minima (and one maxima) among the L sites, it can never be smaller than 1/L.\nD. The average curvature at local minima\n\nThe next natural question to ask is how the average curvature, K at the minimum points scales with the system size\nfor the general system described by eq. (35). This can be evaluated as the conditional average of the local curvature\nat the local minima:\nhKimin = h(\u03c6i \u2212 \u03c6i\u22121 )imin =\n\nh(\u03c6i \u2212 \u03c6i\u22121 )\u0398(\u2212\u03c6i\u22121 )\u0398(\u03c6i )i\nh(\u03c62 \u2212 \u03c61 )\u0398(\u2212\u03c61 )\u0398(\u03c62 )i\n=\nh\u0398(\u2212\u03c6i\u22121 )\u0398(\u03c6i )i\nhui\n\n(44)\n\nwhere translational invariance is exploited again. The numerator in (44) can be obtained after performing the same\nbasis transformation (Appendix A) that was essential to find hui.

OTHER LATTICE MODELS AND AN APPLICATION TO PARALLEL COMPUTING\nA. The single-step model\n\nIn the single-step model the height differences (i.e., the local slopes) are restricted to \u00b11, and the evolution consists\nof particles of height 2 being deposited at the local minima. While the full dynamic behavior of the model belongs\nto the KPZ universality class, in one dimension the steady state is governed by the EW Hamiltonian [25]. Thus, the\nroughness exponent is \u03b1 = 1/2, and we expect the finite-size effects for hui to follow eq. (28). The advantage of\nthis model is that it can be mapped onto a hard-core lattice gas for which the steady-state probability distribution of\nthe configurations is known exactly [25,29]. This enables us to find arbitrary moments of the local minimum density\noperator. Since \u03c6i = \u00b11, it can be simly written as\nL\n\nu=\n\nL\n\n1X\n1 X 1 \u2212 \u03c6i\u22121 1 + \u03c6i\n(1 \u2212 ni\u22121 )ni ,\n=\nL i=1\n2\n2\nL i=1\n\n(49)\n\nPL\nwhere ni = (1 + \u03c6i )/2, corresponds to the hard core lattice gas occupation number. The constraint i=1 \u03c6i = 0\nPL\ntranslates to i=1 ni = L/2. Note that here hui = h(1 \u2212 ni\u22121 )ni i is proportional to the average current.

The Massively Parallel Exponential Update model\n\nOne of the most challenging areas in parallel computing [23] is the efficient implementation of dynamic MonteCarlo algorithms for discrete-event simulations on massively parallel architectures. As already mentioned in the\nIntroduction, it has numerous practical applications ranging from magnetic systems (the discrete events are spin\nflips) to queueing networks ( the discrete events are job arrivals). A parallel architecture by definition contains\n(usually) a large number of processors, or processing elements (PE-s). During the simulation each processor has\nto tackle only a fraction of the full computing task (e.g., a specific block of spins), and the algorithm has to ensure\nthrough synchronization that the underlying dynamics is not altered. In a wide range of models the discrete events are\nPoisson arrivals. Since this stochastic process is reproducible (the sum of two Poisson processes is a Poisson process\nagain with a new arrival frequency), the Poisson streams can be simulated simultaneously on each subsystem carried\nby each PE. As a consequence, the simulated time is local and random, incremented by exponentially distributed\nrandom variables on each PE. However, the algorithm has to ensure that causality accross the boundaries of the\nneighboring blocks is not violated. This requires a comparison between the neighboring simulated times, and waiting,\nif necessary (conservative approach). In the simplest scenario (one site/PE), this means that only those PEs will\nbe allowed to attempt the update the state of the underlying site and increment their local time, where the local\nsimulated time is a local minimum regarding the full simulated time horizon of the system, {\u03c4i }, i = 1, .., L (for\nsimplicity we consider a chain-like connectivity among the PE-s but connectivities of higher degree can be treated\nas well). One can in fact think of the time horizon as a fluctuating surface with height variable \u03c4i . Other examples\nwhere the update attempts are independent Poisson arrivals include arriving calls in the wireless cellular network of a\nlarge metropolitan area [2], or the spin flip attempts in an Ising ferromagnet. This extremely robust parallel scheme\nwas introduced by Lubachevsky, [24] and it is applicable to a wide range of stochastic cellular automata with local\ndynamics where the discrete events are Poisson arrivals. The local random time increments is, in the language of the\nassociated surface, equivalent to depositing random amounts of 'material' (with an exponential distribution) at the\nlocal minima of the surface, see Figure 2. This in fact defines a simple surface growth model which we shall refer to as\n'the massively parallel exponential update model' (MPEU). The main concern about a parallel implementation is its\nefficiency. Since in the next time step only a fraction of PE-s will get updated, i.e., those that are in the local minima\n9\n\n\fof the time horizon, while the rest are in idle, the efficiency is nothing but the average number of non-idling PE-s\ndivided by the total number of PE-s (L), i.e., the average number of minima per unit length, or the minimum-point\ndensity, u. The fundamental question of the so called scalability arises: will the efficiency of the algorithm go to zero\nas the number of PE-s is increased (L \u2192 \u221e) indefinitely, or not? If the efficiency has a non-zero lower bound for\nL \u2192 \u221e the algorithm is called scalable, and certainly this is the preferred type of scheme. Can one design in principle\nsuch efficient algorithms?\n\nFIG. 2. The MPEU model. The arrows show the local minima where random amounts of material will be deposited in the\nnext time step.\n\nAs mentioned in the Introduction, we know of one example that nature provides with an efficient algorithm for a\nvery large number of processing elements: the human brain with its 1011 PE-s is the largest parallel computer ever\nbuilt. Although the intuition suggests that indeed there are scalable parallel schemes, it has only been proved recently,\nsee for details Ref. [1], by using the aforementioned analogy with the simple MPEU surface growth model. While\nthe MPEU model exactly mimics the evolution of the simulated time-horizon, it can also be considered as a primitive\nmodel for ion sputtering of surfaces (etching dynamics): to see this, define a new height variable via hi \u2261 \u2212\u03c4i , i.e. flip\nFigure 2 upside down. This means that instead of depositing material we have to take, 'etch', and this has to be done\nat the local maxima of the {hi } surface. In sputtering of surfaces by ion bombardement an incoming ion-projectile\nwill most likely 'break off' a piece from the top of a mound instead from a valley, very similar to our 'reversed'\nMPEU model. It was shown that the sputtering process is described by the KPZ equation, [22,14]. This qualitative\nargument is in complete agrrement with the extensive MC simulations and a coarse-grained approximation of Ref. [1]\nthat MPEU, similar to the single-step model, it also belongs to the KPZ dynamic universality class; in one dimension\nthe macroscopic landscape is governed by the EW Hamiltonian.\nThe slope varaibles \u03c6i for MPEU are not independent in the L \u2192 \u221e limit, but short-ranged. This already guarantees\nthat the steady-state behavior is governed by the EW Hamiltonian, and the density of local minima does not vanish\nin the thermodynamic limit. Our results confirm that the finite-size effects for hui follow eq.

Density of minima vs. 1/L for the MPEU model.\n\nWe conclude that the basic algorithm (one site per PE) is scalable for one-dimensional arrays. The same correspondence can be applied to model the performance of the algorithm for higher-dimensional logical PE topologies. While\nthis will involve the typical difficulties of surface-growth modeling, such as an absence of exact results and very long\nsimulation times, it establishes potentially fruitful connections between two traditionally separate research areas.\nC. The larger curvature model\n\nIn this subsection we briefly present a curvature driven SOS surface deposition model known in the literature as\nthe larger curvature model, and show a numerical analysis of the density of minima on this model. This model was\noriginally introduced by Kim and Das Sarma [26] and Krug [27] independently, as an atomistic deposition model\nwhich fully conforms to the behaviour of the continuum fourth order linear Mullins equation (\u03bd = 0, \u03ba > 0 in Eq. 4).\nNote that the discrete analysis we presented in Section II is based on the discretization of the continuum equation\nusing the simplest forward Euler differencing scheme. The larger curvature model, however, is a growth model where\nthe freshly deposited particles diffuse on the surface according to the rules of the model until they are embedded.\nSince in all the quantities studied so far, the correspondence (on the level of scaling) between the larger curvature\nmodel and the Langevin equation is very good, we would expect that the dynamic scaling properties of the density\nof minima for both the model and the equation to be identical.\nThe large curvature model has rather simple rules: a freshly deposited atom (let us say at site i) will be incorporated\nat the nearest neighbor site which has largest curvature (i.e., Ki = hi+1 + hi\u22121 \u2212 2hi is maximum). If there are more\nneighbors with the same maximum curvature, then one is chosen randomly. If the original site (i) is among those\nwith maximum curvature, then the atom is incorporated at i.\n\u221a\nFigure 4 shows the scaling of the density of minima < u >L in the steady state, vs. 1/ L. According to Eq. (32),\nfor the fourth order\n\u221a equation on the lattice, the behavior of the density of minima in the steady state scales with\nsystem size as 1/ L. And indeed, Figure 4 shows the same behaviour for the larger curvature model, as expected.\nNote that this behavior sets in at rather small system sizes already, at about L = 100, meaning that the finite system\nsize effects are rather small for the larger curvature model. This is a very fortunate property since increasing the\nsystem size means decreasing the density of minima, therefore relative statistical errors will increase.\n\n11\n\n\f0.05\n0.045\n0.04\n\n<u>L\n\n0.035\n0.03\n0.025\n0.02\n0.015\n0.01\n0.005\n0\n0\n\n0.05\n\n0.1\n\n0.15\n\n0.2\n\n0.25\n\n0.3\n\n0.35\n\n0.4\n\n1/ L\nFIG. 4. Density of minima in the steady state for the larger curvature model.\n\nThis can only be improved by better statistics, i.e., with averages over larger number of runs. This becomes however\n4\nquickly a daunting task, since the cross-over time toward the steady state scales with system size as L\u221a\n. As we shall\nsee in Section V.A, a matematically rigorous approach to the continuum equation yields the same 1/ L behaviour.\nSince the density of minima does decay to zero, an algorithm corresponding to the larger curvature model (or the\nMullins equation) would not be asymptotically scalable.\nFinally, we would like to make a brief note about the observed morphologies in the steady state for the Mullins\nequation , or the related models. It has been shown previously [28] that in the steady state the morphology tipically\nshows a single large mound (or macroscopic groove). At first\nsince we have\n\u221a sight this may appear as a surprise,\n\u221a\nshown that the number of minima (or maxima) diverges as L (the density vanishes as 1/ L. There is however\nno contradiction, because that refers to a a mound that expands throughout the system, i.e. it is a long wavelenght\nstructure, whereas the number of minima measures all the minima, and thus it is a short wavelenght characteristic.\nIn the steady state we indeed have a single large, macroscopic groove, however, there are numerous small dips and\nhumps generated by the constant coupling to the noise.\nIV. EXTREMAL-POINT DENSITIES ON THE CONTINUUM\n\nLet us consider a continuous and at least two times differentiable function f : [0, L] \u2192 R. We are interested in\ncounting the total number of extrema of f in the [0, L] interval. The topology of continuous curves in one dimension\nallows for three possibilities on the nature of a point xi for which f \u2032 |xi = 0. Namely, xi is a local minimum if f \u2032\u2032 |xi > 0,\na local maximum if f \u2032\u2032 |xi < 0 and it is degenerate if f \u2032\u2032 |xi = 0. We call the point xi a degenerate flat of order k, if\nf (j) |xi = 0 for j = 1, 2, .., k and f (k+1) |xi 6= 0, k \u2265 2, assuming that the higher order derivatives f (j) implied exist.\nThe counter-like quantity\n1\nc(L, [f ]) \u2261\nL\n\nZL\n0\n\ndx |f \u2032\u2032 | \u03b4(f \u2032 )\n\n(53)\n\nwhere \u03b4 is the Dirac-delta, gives the number of extremum points per unit length in the interval [0, L], which in the\nlimit of L \u2192 0 is the extremum point density of f in the origin. For our purposes L will always be a finite number,\nhowever, for the sake of briefness we shall refer to c simply as the density of extrema. Note that counting the extrema\nof a function f is equivalent to counting the zeros of its derivate f \u2032 . The divergence of c for finite L implies either the\nexistence of completely flat regions (infinitely degenerate), or an \"infinitely wrinkled\" region, such as for the truncated\nWeierstrass function shown in Fig. 2 ( in this latter case the divergence is understood by taking the limit M \u2192 \u221e).\n12\n\n\fAs already explained in the Introduction this infinitely wrinkled region does not necessarily imply that the curve is\nfractal, but if the curve is fractal, then regions of infinite wrinkledness must exist. The divergence or non-divergence\nof c can be used as an indicator of the existence of such regions (completely flat or infinitely wrinkled).\nOne can make the following precise statement related to the counter c: if xi is an extremum point of f of at most\nfinite degeneracy k, and if there exist a small enough \u01eb, such that f is analytic in the neighborhood [xi \u2212 \u01eb, xi + \u01eb],\nand there are no other extrema in this neighborhood, then\nI(xi ) \u2261\n\nxZi +\u01eb\n\nxi \u2212\u01eb\n\ndx |f \u2032\u2032 | \u03b4(f \u2032 ) = 1 , 0 < \u01eb \u226a 1\n\n(54)\n\nIn the following we give a proof to this statement.\nUsing Taylor-series expansions around xi , one writes:\nak+1\nak\n(x \u2212 xi )k +\n(x \u2212 xi )k+1 + ...\nf \u2032 (x) =\nk!\n(k + 1)!\nak\nak+1\nf \u2032\u2032 (x) =\n(x \u2212 xi )k\u22121 +\n(x \u2212 xi )k + ...\n(k \u2212 1)!\nk!\n\n(55)\n(56)\n\nwhere we introduced the shorthand notation aj \u2261 f (j+1) |xi . For the non-degenerate case of k = 1, (54) follows from\na classical property of the delta function, namely:\nX\n|g \u2032 (xi )|\u22121 \u03b4(x \u2212 xi ) , xi are simple zeros of g.\n(57)\n\u03b4(g(x)) =\ni\n\nLet us now assume that xi is degenerate of order k (k \u2265 2). Using the expansions (55), (56), the variable change\nu = x \u2212 xi , and the well-known property \u03b4(ax) = |a|\u22121 \u03b4(x), we obtain:\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f9\uf8f6\n\uf8ee\nZ\u01eb\n\u221e\n\u221e\nX\nX\n(k \u2212 1)! ak+j j\nak+j j \uf8fb\uf8f8\nk!\nI(xi ) = k du |u|k\u22121 1 +\nu \u03b4 \uf8ed|u|k \uf8f01 +\nu\n(58)\n(k\n\u2212\n1\n+\nj)!\na\n(k\n+\nj)!\nak\nk\nj=1\nj=1\n\u2212\u01eb\n\nR\u01eb\nR0\nR\u01eb\nNext we split the integral (58) in two: \u2212\u01eb ... = \u2212\u01eb ... + 0 , make the variable change u \u2192 \u2212u in the first one, and\nthen z = uk in both integrals. The final expression can then be written in the form:\nI(xi ) =\n\nZ\u01ebk\n\ndz |A(z)| \u03b4(zB(z)) ,\n\n(59)\n\n\u2212\u01ebk\n\nwhere\nA(z) = 1 +\n\n\u221e\nX\nj=1\n\n\u221e\nX\nk!\nak+j j j \u2212j\n(k \u2212 1)! ak+j j j \u2212j\nz |z| k , and B(z) = 1 +\nz |z| k\n(k \u2212 1 + j)! ak\n(k + j)! ak\nj=1\n\n(60)\n\nWe have A(0) = B(0) = 1, and\n\u2032\n\n[zB(z)] = 1 +\n\n\u221e\nX\nj=1\n\n\u0012\n\nk!\nak+j\n(k + j)! ak\n\n\u0013\nj\nj\n+ 1 z j |z| k \u2212j , \u2192\nk\n\n[zB(z)]\u2032 |z=0 = 1 .\n\n(61)\n\n(Take the derivatives separately to the right and to the left of z = 0). Thus, since z = 0 is a simple zero of zB(z),\nproperty (57) can be applied for sufficiently small \u01eb:\nI(xi ) = |A(0)| = 1\n\n(62)\n\nproving our assertion. Note that because of (54), c counts all the non-degenerate and the finitely degenerate points\nas well, giving the equal weight of unity to each. Can we count the non-degenerate extrema separately? The answer\nis affirmative, if one considers instead of (53) the following quantity:\n1\ncq (L, [f ]) \u2261\nL\n\nZL\n0\n\ndx |f \u2032\u2032 |q+1 \u03b4(f \u2032 ) , q > 0\n13\n\n(63)\n\n\fPerforming the same steps as above we obtain for a degenerate point:\n\nIq (xi ) \u2261\nSince k \u2265 2, q 1 \u2212\n\n\u0001\n1\n\nk\n\nxZi +\u01eb\n\nxi \u2212\u01eb\n\ndx |f \u2032\u2032 |q+1\n\n\u0014\n\n|ak |\n\u03b4(f \u2032 ) =\n(k \u2212 1)!\n\n\u0015q Z\u01ebk\n\ndz |z|q(1\u2212 k ) |A(z)|q+1 \u03b4(zB(z)) .\n1\n\n(64)\n\n\u2212\u01ebk\n\n\u2265 12 q > 0, i.e.,\nIq (xi ) = 0 , for xi degenerate.\n\n(65)\n\nThis means, that q > 0 eliminates the degenerate points from the count.

The limit q \u2192 0+ in (67) gives the extremum point density c(L, [f ]) of\nf of non-degenerate extrema:\n1\nc(L, [f ]) = lim+ cq (L, [f ]) = lim+\nq\u21920\nq\u21920 L\n\nZL\n0\n\ndx |f \u2032\u2032 |q+1 \u03b4(f \u2032 )\n\n(68)\n\nIt is important to note, that taking the q \u2192 0+ limit in (67) is not equivalent to taking q = 0 in (63), i.e., the limit\nand the integral on the rhs of (68) are not interchangeable! The difference is the set of degenerate points!\nUntil now, we did not make any distiction between maxima and minima. In a natural way, we expect that the\nquantity:\n1\nu(L, [f ]) \u2261\nL\n\nZL\n\ndx f \u2032\u2032 \u03b4(f \u2032 ) \u03b8(f \u2032\u2032 )\n\n(69)\n\n0\n\nwhere \u03b8(x) is the Heaviside step-function, will give the density of minima (due to the step function, here we can\ndrop the absolute values). However, performing a similar derivation as above, one concludes that (69) is a little bit\nill-defined, in the sense that the weight given to degenerate points depends on the definition of the step-function in\nthe origin (however, u(L, [f ]) is bounded). Introducing a q \u2212 regulator as above, the weight of degenerate points is\npulled down to zero:\n1\nuq (L, [f ]) \u2261\nL\n\nZL\n\ndx [f \u2032\u2032 ]q+1 \u03b4(f \u2032 ) \u03b8(f \u2032\u2032 ) , q > 0.\n\n(70)\n\n0\n\nand\nuq (L, [f ]) =\n\n1X\nq\n[K(xi )] , q > 0, xi non-degenerate minima of f\nL i\n\n(71)\n\nNote that in the equation above the absolute values are not needed, since we are summing over the curvatures of all\nlocal minima.

Stochastic extremal-point densities\n\nWe are interested to explore the previously introduced quantities for a stochastic function, subject to time evolution,\nh(x, t). This function may be for example the solution to a Langevin equation. We define the two basic quantities in\nthe same way as before, except that now one performs a stochastic average over the noise, as well:\n* ZL\n* ZL\n\u0013+\n\u0014 2 \u0015q+1 \u0012 \u0013 \u0012 2 \u0013+\nq+1 \u0012\n1\n\u22022h\n1\n\u2202 h\n\u2202 h\n\u2202h\n\u2202h\nCq (L, t) =\n, and Uq (L, t) =\n\u03b8\n(73)\ndx\ndx\n\u03b4\n\u03b4\n2\n2\nL\n\u2202x\n\u2202x\nL\n\u2202x\n\u2202x\n\u2202x2\n0\n\n0\n\nFor systems preserving translational invariance, the stochastic average of the integrand becomes x-independent, and\nthe integrals can be dropped:\n*\n\u0013+\nq+1 \u0012\n\u2202 2h\n\u2202h\n(74)\nCq (L, t) =\n\u03b4\n\u2202x2\n\u2202x\n*\u0014\n\u0015q+1 \u0012 \u0013 \u0012 2 \u0013+\n\u22022h\n\u2202 h\n\u2202h\nUq (L, t) =\n\u03b8\n(75)\n\u03b4\n2\n\u2202x\n\u2202x\n\u2202x2\nAccording to (67) and (71), Cq (L, t) and Uq (L, t) can be thought of as time dependent \"partition functions\" for\nthe non-degenerate extremal-point densities of the underlying stochastic process, with q playing the role of \"inverse\ntemperature\":\n+\n*\n1X\nq\n, q > 0, xi non-degenerate extrema\n(76)\n|K(xi )|\nCq (L, t) =\nL i\n+\n*\n1X\nq\n, q > 0, xi non-degenerate minima\n(77)\nUq (L, t) =\n[K(xi )]\nL i\nIt is important to mention that in the above equations the average < .. > and the summation are not interchangeable:\nparticular realizations of h have particular sets of minima.\nTwo values for q are of special interest: when q \u2192 0+ and q = 1. In the first case we obtain the stochastic average\nof the density of non-degenerate extrema and minima:\nC(L, t) = lim Cq (L, t) , and U (L, t) = lim Uq (L, t) ,\nq\u21920+\n\nq\u21920+\n\n(78)\n\nand in the second case we obtain the stochastic average of the mean curvature at extrema and minima:\nK ext (L, t) =\n\nC1 (L, t)\nU1 (L, t)\n, and K min (L, t) =\n,\nC(L, t)\nU (L, t)\n\n(79)\n\n(we need to normalize with the number of extrema/minima per unit length to get the curvature per extremum/minimum).\nIn the following we explore the quantities (74)-(79) for a large class of linear Langevin equations. To simplify the\ncalculations, we will assume that q is a positive integer. Then we will attempt analytic continuation on the final result\nas a function of q. In the calculations we will make extensive use of the standard integral representations of the delta\nand step functions:\n\u03b4(y) =\n\nZ\u221e\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\n\u221e Z\u221e\ndz izy X\ndz (iz)n n\ne =\ny ,\n2\u03c0\n2\u03c0 n!\nn=0\n\n\u03b8(y) = lim\n\n(80)\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nZ\u221e\n\n\u01eb\u21920+\n\u2212\u221e\n\n\u221e Z\u221e\nX\ndz eizy\n1\n(iz)n n\ndz\n= lim\ny\n2\u03c0 \u01eb + iz \u01eb\u21920+ n=0\n2\u03c0 \u01eb + iz n!\n\n(81)\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nIf q is a positive integer, we may drop the absolute value signs in (75). In (74) we can only do that for odd q.\nThe absolute values make the calculation of stochastic averages very difficult. We can get around this problem by\nemploying the following identity:\n|y|n = y n {(\u22121)n + \u03b8(y) [1 \u2212 (\u22121)n ]}\n15\n\n(82)\n\n\fThis brings (74) to\nCq (L, t) = [1 \u2212 (\u22121)q ] Uq (L, t) + (\u22121)q+1 Bq (L, t)\n\n(83)\n\nwhere\nBq (L, t) =\n\n*\n\n1\nL\n\nZL\n0\n\ndx\n\n\u0012\n\n\u22022h\n\u2202x2\n\n\u0013q+1 \u0012 \u0013+ *\u0012 2 \u0013q+1 \u0012 \u0013+\n\u2202 h\n\u2202h\n\u2202h\n=\n\u03b4\n\u03b4\n2\n\u2202x\n\u2202x\n\u2202x\n\n(84)\n\nObviously for q odd integer, Bq = Cq . For q even, Bq is an interesting quantity by itself. In this case the weight of an\nextremum xi is sgn(K(xi ))|K(xi )|q . If the analytic continuation can be performed, then the q \u2192 0+ limit will tell us\nif there are more non-degenerate maxima than minima (or otherwise) in average. Using the integral representations\n(80) and (81):\n*\u0012\n\u0013q+1 \u0012 \u0013n +\n\u221e Z\u221e\nX\ndz (iz)n\n\u22022h\n\u2202h\nBq (L, t) =\n2\n2\u03c0 n!\n\u2202x\n\u2202x\nn=0\n\n(85)\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\n*\u0012\n\u0013n +q+1 \u0012 \u0013n1 +\nZ\u221e\n\u221e X\n\u221e Z\u221e\nX\n1\n\u2202h\n\u22022h 2\ndz2 (iz2 )n2\ndz1 (iz1 )n1\nUq (L, t) = lim\n2\n+\n2\u03c0\nn1 !\n2\u03c0\nn2 ! \u01eb + iz2\n\u2202x\n\u2202x\n\u01eb\u21920\nn =0 n =0\n1\n\n2\n\n(86)\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nV. EXTREMAL-POINT DENSITIES OF LINEAR STOCHASTIC EVOLUTION EQUATIONS\n\nNext we calculate the densities (85), (86) for the following type of linear stochastic equations:\n\u0001z/2\n\u2202h\nh + \u03b7(x, t) ,\n= \u2212\u03bd \u2212\u22072\n\u2202t\n\n\u03bd, D, z > 0 ,\n\nx \u2208 [0, L]\n\n(87)\n\nwith initial condition h(x, 0) = 0, for all x \u2208 [0, L]. \u03b7 is a white noise term drawn from a Gaussian distribution with\nzero mean h\u03b7(x, t)i = 0, and covariance :\nh\u03b7(x, t)\u03b7(x\u2032 , t\u2032 )i = 2D\u03b4(x \u2212 x\u2032 ) \u03b4(t \u2212 t\u2032 ) ,\n\n(88)\n\nWe also performed our calculations with other noise types, such as volume conserving and long-range correlated,\nhowever the details are to lengthy to be included in the present paper, it will be the subject of a future publication.\nAs boundary condition we choose periodic boundaries:\nh(x + nL, t) = h(x, t) , \u03b7(x + nL, t) = \u03b7(x, t) , for all n \u2208 Z\n\n(89)\n\nThe general solution to (87) is obtained simply with the help of Fourier series [18]. The Fourier series and its\ncoefficients for a function f defined on [0, L] is\nf (x) =\n\nX\nk\n\nwhere k =\n\n2\u03c0\nL n,\n\n1\nf \u0303(k) eikx , f \u0303(k) =\nL\n\nZL\n\ndx f (x) e\u2212ikx\n\n(90)\n\n\u2212L\n\nn = .., \u22122, \u22121, 0, 1, 2, ... The Fourier coefficients of the general solution to (87) are:\nh\u0303(k, t) =\n\nZt\n\ndt\u2032 e\u2212\u03bd|k|\n\nz\n\n(t\u2212t\u2032 )\n\n\u03b7\u0303(k, t\u2032 )\n\n(91)\n\n0\n\nThe correlations of the noise in momentum space are:\nh\u03b7\u0303(k, t)\u03b7\u0303(k \u2032 , t\u2032 )i =\n\n2D\n\u03b4k,\u2212k\u2032 \u03b4(t \u2212 t\u2032 ) .\nL\n16\n\n(92)\n\n\fDue to the Gaussian character of the noise, the two-point correlation of the solution (91) is also delta-correlated\nand it completely characterizes the statistical properties of the stochastic dynamics (87). It is given by:\nD\nE\n(93)\nh\u0303(k, t)h\u0303(k \u2032 , t\u2032 ) = S(k, t)\u03b4k,\u2212k\u2032\n\nwhere S(k, t) is the structure factor given by:\n\nS(k, t) =\n\ni\nz\nD h\n1 \u2212 e\u22122\u03bd|k| t .\nz\n\u03bdL|k|\n\n(94)\n\nEquation (87) has been analyzed in great detail by a number of authors, see Ref. [18] for a review. It was shown that\nthere exist un upper critical dimension dc = z for the noisy case of Eq. (87) which separates the rough regime with\nd < z from the non-roughening regime d > z. In one dimension, the rough regime corresponds to the condition z > 1,\nwhich we shall assume from now on, since this is where the interesting physics lies.\nNext, we evaluate the quantities (74)-(79) via directly calculating the expressions in (85) and (86). This amounts\nto computing averages of type:\n*\u0012\n\u0013N \u0012 \u0013M +\n\u22022h\n\u2202h\nQN,M =\n(95)\n2\n\u2202x\n\u2202x\nExpressing h with its Fourier series according to (90), we write:\n\u0013M\n\n\u0012\n\n\u2202h\n\u2202x\n\n\u0012\n\n\u22022h\n\u2202x2\n\n= iM\n\nX\n\n...\n\nk1 ...kM h\u0303(k1 , t)...h\u0303(kM , t) ei(k1 +...+kM )x\n\n(96)\n\nkM\n\nk1\n\n\u0013N\n\nX\n\n= (\u22121)N\n\nX\nk1\u2032\n\n...\n\nX\n\n2\n\n2\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\u2032\nk1\u2032 ...kN\nh\u0303(k1\u2032 , t)...h\u0303(kN\n, t) ei(k1 +...+kN )x\n\n(97)\n\n\u2032\nkN\n\nwhich then is inserted in (95).\nThus in Fourier space one needs to calculate averages of type\n\u2032\nhh\u0303(k1 , t)...h\u0303(kM , t)h\u0303(k1\u2032 , t)...h\u0303(kN\n, t)i. According to (93) h\u0303 is anti-delta-correlated, therefore these averages can be\nperformed in the standard way [30] which is by taking all the possible pairings of indices and employing (93). In our\ncase there are three types of pairings: {kj , kl }, {kj , kl\u2032 }, and {kj\u2032 , kl\u2032 }. Let us pick a 'mixed' pair {kj , kl\u2032 } containing a\nprimed and a non-primed index. The corresponding contribution in the QN,M will be:\nXX\n\u2032\n2\nkj kl\u2032 S(kl\u2032 , t)ei(kj +kl )x \u03b4kj ,\u2212kl\u2032\n(98)\nkj\n\nkl\u2032\n\nP\nSince the structure factor S(k, t) is an even function in k, (98) becomes kj kj 3 S(kj , t) = 0, because the summand\nis an odd function of kj and the summation is symmetric around zero. Thus, it is enough to consider non-mixed\nindex-pairs, only. This means, that QN,M decouples into:\n*\u0012\n\u0013N + *\u0012 \u0013M +\n\u2202h\n\u22022h\n(99)\nQN,M =\n\u2202x2\n\u2202x\nThe averages are calculated easily, and we find:\n*\u0012 \u0013 + \uf8f1\nM\n\uf8f2 (M \u2212 1)!!

The sum over n1 in (86) is easy and leads to the Gaussian e\u2212\u03c62 (L,t)z1 /2 .\nHowever, the sum over n2 is more involved. Let us make the temporary notation for the sum over n2 :\n\u221e\nX\n(iz2 )n2\nr\n(2r \u2212 1)!!

This can be obtained after using the formula:\nZ\u221e\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\n\u03bd\n\ndx (x \u00b1 ic) Hn (x) e\n\n\u2212x2\n\n=2\n\n\u0001\n\u0393 n\u2212\u03bd\ni\u03c0\n2\n\u03c0\ne\u00b1 2 (\u03bd+n) ,\n\u0393(\u2212\u03bd)\n\nn\u22121\u2212\u03bd \u221a\n\nc \u2192 0+ .\n\n(111)\n\nFinally, the densities for the minima read as:\ns+ 1\n\n2s\u22121\n[\u03c64 (L, t)] 2\nU2s (t) =\n\u0393(s + 1) p\n\u03c0\n\u03c62 (L, t)\n\u0013\n\u0012\ns\u2212 32\n2\n1 [\u03c64 (L, t)]s\np\nU2s\u22121 (t) =\n\u0393 s+\n\u03c0\n2\n\u03c62 (L, t)\n18\n\n(112)\n(113)\n\n\fFormulas (103), (104), (112), and (113) combined with (83) can be condensed very simply, and we obtain the general\nresult as:\nq\n\u0011 [\u03c6 (L, t)] q+1\n2\n2 2 \u22121 \u0010 q\n4\np\n\u0393\n+1\nUq (L, t) =\n\u03c0\n2\n\u03c62 (L, t)\nCq (L, t) = 2Uq (L, t)\n\n(114)\n(115)\n\nEquations (114), (115) with together with (113) fully solve the problem for the density of non-degenerate extrema.\nEq. (115) is an expected result in one dimension, because Eq. (87) preserves the up-down symmetry. The density of\nnon-degenerate minima is:\ns\n1\n\u03c64 (L, t)\nU (L, t) = lim Uq (L, t) =\n(116)\n2\u03c0\n\u03c62 (L, t)\nq\u21920+\nand the stochastic average of the mean curvature at a minimum point is:\nr\n\u03c0 p\nU1 (L, t)\n=\nK(L, t) =\n\u03c64 (L, t)\n2\nU (L, t)\n\n(117)\n\ni.e., the average curvature at a minimum is proportional to the square root of the fourth moment of the structure\nfactor. In the following section we exploit the physical information behind the above expressions for the stochastic\nprocess (87). At some parameter values a few, or all the quantities above may diverge. In this case we introduce a\nmicroscopic lattice cut-off 0 < a \u226a 1, and analyze the limit a \u2192 0+ in the final formulas. This in fact corresponds\nto placing the whole problem on a lattice with lattice constant a. It has been shown in Ref. [18] that for the class\nof equations (87) there are three important length-scales that govern the statistical behavior of the interface h: the\nlattice constant a, the system size L, and the dynamical correlation length \u03be defined by:\n\u03be(t) \u2261 (2\u03bdt)1/z\nAccording to (102) and (94) the function \u03c6m (L, t) becomes:\n\u0013m\u2212z \u0014\n\u0001 \u0015\n\u221e \u0012\n2\u03c0n z\n2D X 2\u03c0n\n\u2212\n\u03be\nL\n, m = 2, 4\n1\u2212e\n\u03c6m (L, t) =\n\u03bdL n=0\nL\n\n(118)\n\n(119)\n\nThe n = 0 term can be dropped from the sum above, because it is zero even for m < z (expand the exponential\nand then take n = 0). However, the whole sum may diverge depending on m and z. In order to handle all the cases,\nincluding the divergent ones we introduce a microscopic lattice cut-off a, 0 < a \u226a 1, and then analyze the limit\na \u2192 0+ in the final expressions. This is in fact equivalent to putting the whole problem on a lattice of lattice spacing\na. Appropiately, (119) becomes:\nL\n\n\u0012\n\u0013m\u2212z \u0014\n\u0001 \u0015\n2a\n2\u03c0n z\n2\u03c0n\n2D X\n\u03c6m (L, t) =\n, m = 2, 4\n1 \u2212 e\u2212 \u03be L\n\u03bdL n=1\nL\n\n(120)\n\nA. Steady-state regime.\n\nPutting \u03be = \u221e in (120) \u03c6m takes a simpler form:\n2D\n\u03c6m (L, \u221e) =\n\u03bdL\n\n\u0012\n\n2\u03c0\nL\n\nL\n\u0013m\u2212z X\n2a\n\nnm\u2212z , m = 2, 4\n\n(121)\n\nn=1\n\nAs a \u2192 0+ , \u03c6m becomes proportional to \u03b6(z \u2212 m). For z \u2212 m > 1 \u03c6m is convergent, otherwise it is divergent. In the\ndivergent case we quote the following results:\nN\nX\n\nn=1\n\nns = ln N + C + O(1/N ) , if s = \u22121\n19\n\n(122)\n\n\fand\nN\nX\n\nns =\n\nn=1\n\ni\nN s+1 h\n1 + O(1/N ) , if s > \u22121\ns+1\n\n(123)\n\nwhich we will use to derive the leading behaviour of the extremal point densities when L/a \u2192 \u221e.

(124-126) for a \u2192 0+ generate two critical values for z,\nnamely z = 3 and z = 5. In the three regions separated by these values we obtain qualitatively different behaviors for\nthe extremal-point densities.\ni) z > 5. All quantities are convergent as a \u2192 0+ .

(128) shows that there are a finite number of minima ( \u03b6(z \u2212 4)/\u03b6(z \u2212 2)) in the steady state, independently of\nthe system size L. (U (L, \u221e) is the number of minima per unit length, and LU (L, \u221e) is the number of minima on the\nsubstrate of size L). The mean curvature K(L, \u221e) diverges with system size as L(z\u22125)/2 . This is consistent with the\nfact that the system size grows as L, the width grows as L(z\u22121)/2 , i.e., faster than L, and thus the peaks and minima\nshould become sleeker and sharper as L \u2192 \u221e, expecting diverging curvatures in minima and maxima. However, this\nis not always true, since the sleekness of the humps and mounds does not necessarily imply large curvatures in minima\nand maxima if the shape of the humps also changes as L changes, i.e., there is lack of self-affinity. The existence of\nz = 5 as a critical value is a non-trivial results coming from the presented analysis.\nii) z = 5. According to (122), \u03c64 (L, \u221e) diverges logarithmically as a \u2192 0+ . One obtains:\n\nK(L, \u221e) = (2\u03c0)\n\nUq (\u221e) \u2243 \u0393\n\n\u0010q\n\n2\n\n+1\n\n5\u2212z\n2\n\n\u0011 \u0012 2D \u0013 2q\n\u03bd\u03c0\n\n1\np\n\u03b6(3) L\n\n1\n1\nU (L, \u221e) = p\nL\n\u03b6(3)\n20\n\n1\n\nr\n\nln\n\n\u0012\n\u0013 q+1\n2\nL\nln\n+C\n,\n2a\n\nL\n+C ,\n2a\n\n(130)\n\n(131)\n\n\fK(L, \u221e) =\n\ns\n\nD\n2\u03bd\n\n\u0012\n\u0013\nL\nln\n+C .\n2a\n\n(132)\n\nEq. (131) shows that the although the density of minima vanishes, the number of minima is no longer a constant but\ndiverges logarithmically with system size L. The mean curvature still diverges, but logarithmically, when compared\nto the power law divergence of (129).\nFor the mean curvature K(\u221e) in (126) z = 5 is the only critical value, since it only depends on \u03c64 . For z < 5,\nusing Eq. (123) we arrive to the result that the mean curvature in a minimum point approaches to an L-independent\nconstant for L/a \u2192 \u221e with corrections on the order of a/L:\ns\n\u0010 \u03c0 \u0011 5\u2212z\nD\n2\nK(L, \u221e) \u2243\n, z<5\n(133)\na\n2\u03bd(5 \u2212 z)\nWe arrived to the same conclusion in Section II.D when we studied the steady state of the discretized version of the\ncontinuum equation. Coincidentally, for z = 4 the two constant values from (133) and (47) are identical (a = 1 by\ndefinition in (47).\niii) 3 < z < 5. In this case \u03c64 (L, \u221e) \u2192 \u221e and \u03c62 (L, \u221e) < \u221e as a \u2192 0+ , and:\nz\u22123\n\u0011 \u0012 2D \u0013 2q \u0010 \u03c0 \u0011 2q (5\u2212z) \u0012 1 \u0013 5\u2212z\n2\nL\u2212 2\n+1\nUq (L, \u221e) \u2243 \u0393\n,\np\nq+1\n2\n\u03bd\u03c0\na\n2a\n(5 \u2212 z) 2\n\u03b6(z \u2212 2)\n\n\u0010q\n\nand\n\nU (L, \u221e) \u2243\n\n\u0012\n\n1\n2a\n\n\u0013 5\u2212z\n2\n\n(134)\n\nz\u22123\n\nL\u2212 2\np\n,\n(5 \u2212 z)\u03b6(z \u2212 2)\n\n(135)\n\nand the mean curvature is just given by (133).\nComparing Eqs. (127), (130), and (134) we can make an interesting observation: while for z \u2265 5 the dependence\non the system size L is coupled to the 'inverse temperature' q, for 3 < z < 5 the dependence on L decouples from q,\ni.e., it becomes independent of the inverse temperature! Eq. (135) shows that the density of minima vanishes with\nsystem size as a power law with an exponent (z \u2212 3)/2 but the number of minima of the substrate diverges as a power\nlaw with an exponent of (5 \u2212 z)/2.\niv) z = 3. In this case \u03c64 (L, \u221e) \u2192 \u221e and \u03c62 (L, \u221e) \u2192 \u221e logarithmically as a \u2192 0+ . One obtains:\n\u0010q\n\u0011\n1\n+1\nUq (L, \u221e) \u2243 \u221a \u0393\n2\n2 2a\n\n\u0012\n\n\u03c0D\n\u03bda2\n\n\u0013 2q\n\nand\n\n1\nq\n,\nL\n+C\nln 2a\n\n1\n1\nU (L, \u221e) \u2243 \u221a q\n,\n2 2a ln L + C\n2a\n\n(136)\n\n(137)\n\nwith a logarithmically vanishing density of minima, and the dependence on the system size in (136) is not coupled\nto q.\nv) 1 < z < 3. Now both \u03c64 and \u03c62 diverge as a \u2192 0+ . Employing (123), yields:\n\u0011 \u0012 2D \u0013 2q \u0010 \u03c0 \u0011 2q (5\u2212z) \u221a3 \u2212 z\n1 \u0010q\n\u0393\n+1\n(138)\nUq (L, \u221e) \u2243\nq+1 ,\n2a\n2\n\u03c0\u03bd\na\n(5 \u2212 z) 2\nand\n1\nU (L, \u221e) \u2243\n2a\n\nr\n\n3\u2212z\n.\n5\u2212z\n\n(139)\n\nNote, that in leading order, both Uq (L, \u221e) and the density of minima U (L, \u221e) become system size independent!\nThe system size dependence comes in as corrections on the order of a/L and higher. The fact that the efficiency of\n21\n\n\fthe massively parallel algorithm presented in Section III.B is not vanishing is due precisely to the above phenomenon:\nthe fluctuations of the time horizon in the steady state belong to the z = 2 class (Edwards-Wilkinson universality),\nand according to the results under iv), the density of minima (or the efficiency of the parallel algorithm) converges\nto a non-zero constant, as L \u2192 \u221e, ensuring the scalability of the algorithm. An algorithm that would map into a\nz \u2265 3 class would have a vanishing efficiency\u221awith increasing the number of processing elements. In particular, for\nz = 2, one obtains from (139) U (L, \u221e) \u2243 (a2 3)\u22121 = 0.2886.../a. Note that the utilization we obtained is somewhat\ndifferent from the discrete case which was 0.25. This is due to the fact that this number is non-universal and it may\nshow differences depending on the discretization scheme used, however it cannot be zero.\nAnother important conclusion can be drawn from the final results enlisted above: at and below z = 5, all the\nquantities diverge when a \u2192 0+ , and keep L fixed. This means that the higher the resolution the more details we find\nin the morphology, just as for an infinitely wrinkled, or a fractal-like surface. We call this transition accross z = 5 a\n'wrinkle' transition. As shown in the Introduction, wrinkledness can assume two phases depending on whether the\ncurve is a fractal or not and the transition between these two pases may be conceived as a phase transition. However,\none may be able to scale the system size L with a such that the quantities calculated will not diverge in this limit.\nThis is possible only in the regime 3 < z < 5, when we impose:\nLz\u22123 a(q+1)(5\u2212z) = const.\n\n(140)\n\nThis shows that the rescaling cannot be done for all inverse temperatures q at the same time. In particular, for the\ndensity of minima and z = 4, La = const.\nB. Scaling regime\n\nIn order to obtain the temporal behavior of the extremal-point densities we will use the Poisson summation formula\n(B4) from Appendix B on (120). After simple changes of variables in the integrals this leads to:\ni D\n\u03c0 z\nD \u0010 \u03c0 \u0011m\u2212z h\n\u03c6m (L, t) =\n1 \u2212 e\u2212(\u03be a ) +\n\u03be \u2212(m\u2212z+1)\n\u03bdL a\n\u03c0\u03bd\n\u221e\n2D \u2212(m\u2212z+1) X\n\u03be\n\u03c0\u03bd\nn=1\n\n\u03c0\u03be/a\nZ\n\n\u03c0\u03be/a\nZ\n0\n\n\u0011\n\u0010\nz\ndx xm\u2212z 1 \u2212 e\u2212x +\n\ndx xm\u2212z cos\n\n0\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\u0010\n\u0011\nz\nL\nnx\n1 \u2212 e\u2212x\n\u03be\n\n(141)\n\nThis expression shows, that the scaling properties of the dynamics are determined by the dimensionless ratios L/\u03be\nand \u03be/a. The scaling regime is defined by a \u226a \u03be \u226a L.\nAs we have seen in the previous section, \u03c6m is convergent for z > m + 1 but diverges when z \u2264 m + 1, as a \u2192 0+ .\nIn the convergent case, the lattice spacing a can be taken as zero, and thus the first term on the rhs. of (141) vanishes\nand the time dependence of the infinite system-size piece of \u03c6m (the first integral term in (141)) assumes the clean\npower-law behaviour of t(z\u2212m\u22121)/z (with a positive exponent). In the divergent case, however, the non-integral term\nof (141) does not vanish, and the time-dependence will not be a clean power-law. Even the integral terms will present\ncorrections to the power-law t\u2212(m+1\u2212z)/z (which has now a negative exponent), since the limits for integration contain\n\u03be. The first intergal on the rhs of (141) for z 6= m + 1 can be calculated exactly:\n\u03c0\u03be/a\nZ\n\nm\u2212z\n\ndx x\n\n0\n\n\u0010\n\n1\u2212e\n\n\u2212xz\n\n\u0011\n\n1\n=\nm\u2212z+1\n\n\u0012\n\n\u03c0\u03be\na\n\n\u0013m\u2212z+1\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0012\n\u0012 \u0013z \u0013\n1\n1\nm\u2212z+1\nm \u2212 z + 1 \u03c0\u03be\n+ \u0393\n, z 6= m + 1\n\u2212 \u0393\n,\nz\nz\nz\nz\na\n(142)\n\nwhere \u0393(\u03b1, x) is the incomplete Gamma function. In our case (\u03c0\u03be/a)z is a large number, and therefore we can use\nthe asymptotic representation of \u0393(\u03b1, x) for large x, see [32], pp. 951, equation 8.357. According to this, for large\nx, \u0393(\u03b1, x) \u223c x\u03b1\u22121 e\u2212x , i.e., it can become arbitrarily small, with an exponential decay. This term can therefore be\nneglected from (142), compared to the other two terms, even in the divergent case. Inserting (142) into (141), we will\nsee that also the non-integral piece of (141) can be neglected compared to the term generated by the first on the rhs\nof (142), since in the scaling regime a \u226a \u03be \u226a L, and thus the ratio a/L can be neglected compared to (m \u2212 z + 1)\u22121 .\n(This is needed only in the divergent regime, z < m + 1.)

According to the large-x expansion of the exponential integral\nfunction, see [32], pp. 935, equation 8.215, Ei(\u2212x) \u223c \u2212x\u22121 e\u2212x , it is vanishing exponentially fast, thus it can be\nneglected in the expression of \u03c6m in the scaling limit:\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012 \u0013\nD\nDC\nL \u03be\nD\n\u03c0\u03be\n\u03c6m (L, t) \u2243\n+\n, z =m+1\n(146)\nln\n+\nFm\n,\n\u03c0\u03bd\na\n\u03c0\u03bdz\n\u03c0\u03bd\n\u03be a\nwhere\n\u03c0\u03c1\n\n\u221e Z\n\u0011\n\u0010\nX\nz\ndx\ncos (\u03bbnx) 1 \u2212 e\u2212x , z = m + 1\nFm (\u03bb, \u03c1) = 2\nx\nn=1\n\n(147)\n\n0\n\nThus in the scaling limit, the temporal behavior of \u03c6m becomes a logarithmic time dependence plus a constant, as\nlong as L/\u03be \u226b 1.\nObserve that for z < m + 1 the first term on the rhs. of (143), reproduces exactly the diverging term (as a \u2192 0+ )\nof the steady-state expression (121) which can be seen after employing (122) in (121). This means that for \u03be \u2192 \u221e,\nEm (L/\u03be, \u03be/a) diverges slower than \u03be m+1\u2212z (this is how the saturation occurs). Similarly, for z = m + 1 the first term\non the rhs of (146) (after replacing \u03be with L ) reproduces the diverging term (as a \u2192 0+ ) of the steady-state expression\n(121) which can be seen after employing (123) in (121). This means, that in the saturation (or steady-state) regime\nthe remaining terms from (146) must behave as const. + O(a/L) + ln (L/\u03be), as \u03be \u2192 \u221e while keeping L and a fixed.\nJust as in the case of steady-state one has to distinguish 5 cases depending on the values of z, with respect to the\ncritical values 3 and 5. For the sake of simplicity of writing, we will omit the arguments of Em (\u03bb, \u03c1) and Fm (\u03bb, \u03c1).\ni) z > 5.

Density of minima for the larger curvature model as a function of time (the nr of deposited layers), for two system\nsizes, L = 100 (diamonds) and L = 120 (crosses). The straight line corresponds to the behavior t\u22121/8 .\n\n24\n\n\fAn important conclusion that can be drawn from these expressions is that below z = 5, the leading time-dependence\nof the partition function Uq (L, t) becomes independent of the inverse temperature q and it presents a clean power-law\ndecay \u223c t\u2212(z\u22123)/2z which is the same also for U (L, t). In particular, for z = 4 this means a t\u22121/8 decay which is\nvery well verified by the larger curvature model from Section III.C, see Figure 5. Also notice from Eq. (156) that\nthe leading term is system size independent. And indeed, this property is also in a very good agreement with the\nnumerics on the larger curvature model from Figure 5, where the two data sets for L = 100 and L = 120 practically\ncoincide.\nSince the mean curvature depends on \u03c64 , only, for all cases below z = 5 the dependence is given by the same\nformula (157) (just need to replace the corresponding value for z).\niv) z = 3.

The density of minima was shown in Section II to have this property in the steadystate. Here we see not only that but also the fact that all q-moments show the same behavior, and even more, the\ntime behavior before reaching the steady-state constant is not a clean power-law, but rather a decaying correction in\nthe approach to this constant. The leading term in the temporal correction is of \u223c t\u2212(3\u2212z)/z and the next-to-leading\nhas \u223c t\u2212(5\u2212z)/z .\nVI. CONCLUSIONS AND OUTLOOK\n\nIn summary, based on the analytical results presented, a short wavelength based analysis of interface fluctuations can\nprovide us with novel type of information and give an alternative description of surface morphologies. This analysis\ngives a more detailed characterization and can be used to distinguish interfaces that are 'fuzzy' from those that\nlocally appear to be smooth, and the central quantities, the extremal-point densities are numerically and analytically\naccessible. The partition function-like formalism enables us to access a wide range of q-momenta of the local curvatures\ndistribution. In the case of the stochastic evolution equations studied we could exactly relate these q-momenta to the\nstructure function of the process via the simple quantities \u03c62 and \u03c64 . The wide spectrum of results accessed through\nthis technique shows the richness of short wavelength physics. This physics is there, and the long wavelength approach\njust simply cannot reproduce it, but instead may suggest an oversimplified picture of the reality. For example, the\nMPEU model has been shown to belong in the steady state to the EW universality class, however, it cannot be\n25\n\n\fdescribed exactly by the EW equation in all respects, not even in the steady-state! For example, the utilization (or\ndensity of minima) of the MPEU model is 0.24641 which for the EW model on a lattice is 0.25. Also, if one just\nsimply looks at the steady-state configuration, one observes high skewness for the MPEU model [1], whereas the EW\nis completely up-down symmetric. This can also be shown by comparing the calculated two-slope correlators. For a\nnumber of models that belong to the KPZ equation universality class, this broken-symmetry property vs. the EW\ncase has been extensively investigated by Neergard and den Nijs [33]. The difference on the short wavelength scale\nbetween two models that otherwise belong to the same universality class lies in the existence of irrelevant operators (in\nthe RG sense). Although these operators do not change universal properties, the quantities associated with them may\nbe of very practical interest. The parallel computing example shows that the fundamental question of algorithmic\nscalability is answered based on the fact that the simulated time horizon in the steady state belongs to the EW\nuniversality class, thus it has a finite density of local minima. The actual value of the density of local minima in\nthe thermodynamic limit, however, strongly depends on the details of the microscopics, which in principle can be\ndescribed in terms of irrelevant operators [33].\nThe extremal-point densities introduced in the present paper may actually have a broader application than stochastic\nsurface fluctuations. The main geometrical characterization of fractal curves is based on the construction of their\nHaussdorff-Besikovich dimension, or the 'box-counting' dimension: one covers the set with small boxes of linear size \u01eb\nand then track the divergence of the number of boxes needed to cover in a minimal way the whole set as \u01eb is lowered\nto zero. For example, a smooth line in the plane has a dimension of unity, but the Weierstrass curve of (2) has a\ndimension of ln b/ ln a (for b > a). The actual length of a fractal curve whose dimension is larger than unity will\ndiverge when \u01eb \u2192 0+ . The total length at a given resolution \u01eb is a global property of the fractal, it does not tell us\nabout the way 'it curves'. The novel measure we propose in (3) is meant to characterize the distribution of a local\nproperty of the curve, its bending which in turn is a measure of the curve's wrinkledness. For simplicity we formulated\nit for functions, i.e., for curves which are single-valued in a certain direction. This can be remedied and generalized by\nintroducing a parametrization \u03b3 \u2208 [0, 1] of the curve, and then plotting the local curvature vs. this parameter K(\u03b3).\nThe plot will be a single valued function on which now (3) is easily defined.\nOther desirable extensions of the present technique are: 1) to include a statistical description of the degeneracies\nof higher order, and 2) to repeat the analysis for higher (such as d = 2) substrate dimensions. The latter is promising\nan even richer spectrum of novelties, since in higher dimensions there is a plethora of singular points (\u2207f = 0)\nwhich are classified by the eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix of the function in the singular point. Deciphering the\nstatistical behaviour of these various singularities for randomly evolving surfaces is an interesting challenge. The\nstudies performed by Kondev and Henley [34] on the distribution of contours on random Gaussian surfaces should\ncome to a good aid in achieving this goal. In particular we may find the method developed here useful in studying\nthe spin-glass ground state, and the spin-glass transition problem. And at last but not the least, we invite the reader\nto consider instead of the Langevin equations studied here, noisy wave equations, with a second derivative of the time\ncomponent, or other stochastic evolution equations.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\nWe thank S.
