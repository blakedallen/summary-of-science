Introduction\nThe theory of effectiveness properties on countable structures whose atomic diagrams are Turing computable is well-studied (see, for instance, [1, 14]). Typical\nresults describe which structures in various classes are computable (or have isomorphic copies that are) [18], or the potential degree of unsolvability of various\ndefinable subsets of the structure [15]. The goal of the present paper is to survey\nsome initial results investigating similar concerns on structures which are effective\nin a different sense.\nA rather severe limitation of the Turing model of computability is its traditional\nrestriction to the countable. Of course, many successful generalizations have been\nmade (see, for instance, [27, 11, 12, 22, 23, 25] and the other papers in the present\nvolume). The generalization that will be treated here is based on the observation\nthat while there is obviously no Turing machine for addition and multiplication\nof real numbers, there is strong intuition that these operations are \"computable.\"\nThe BSS model of computation, first introduced in [4], approximately takes this\nto be the definition of computation on a given ring (a more formal definition is\nThe first author is grateful for the support of Grant #13397 from the Templeton Foundation.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nW. CALVERT AND J. E. PORTER\n\nforthcoming). This allows several problems of computation in numerical analysis\nand continuous geometry to be treated rigorously. The monograph [3] gives the\nexamples of the \"decision problem\" of the points for which Newton's method will\nconverge to a root, and determining whether a given point is in the Mandelbrot set.\n1.1. Basic Definitions. The definition of a BSS machine comes from [3]. Such\na machine should be thought of as the analogue of a Turing machine (indeed, the\ntwo notions coincide where R = Z). Let R be a ring with 1. Let R\u221e be the set of\nfinite sequences of elements from R, and R\u221e the bi-infinite direct sum\nM\nR.\ni\u2208Z\n\nDefinition 1.1. A machine M over R is a finite connected directed graph, containing five types of nodes: input, computation, branch, shift, and output, with the\nfollowing properties:\n(1) The unique input node has no incoming edges and only one outgoing edge.\n(2) Each computation and shift node has exactly one output edge and possibly\nseveral input branches.\n(3) Each output node has no output edges and possibly several input edges.\n(4) Each branch node \u03b7 has exactly two output edges (labeled 0\u03b7 and 1\u03b7 ) and\npossibly several input edges.\n(5) Associated with the input node is a linear map gI : R\u221e \u2192 R\u221e .\n(6) Associated with each computation node \u03b7 is a rational function g\u03b7 : R\u221e \u2192\nR\u221e .\n(7) Associated with each branch node \u03b7 is a polynomial function h\u03b7 : R\u221e \u2192 R.\n(8) Associated with each shift node is a map \u03c3\u03b7 \u2208 {\u03c3l , \u03c3r }, where \u03c3l (x)i = xi+1\nand \u03c3r (x)i = xi\u22121 .\n(9) Associated with each output node \u03b7 is a linear map O\u03b7 : R\u221e \u2192 R\u221e .\nA machine may be understood to compute a function in the following way:\nDefinition 1.2. Let M be a machine over R.\n(1) A path through M is a sequence of nodes (\u03b7i )ni=0 where \u03b70 is the input node,\n\u03b7n is an output node, and for each i, we have an edge from \u03b7i to \u03b7i+1 .\nn\n(2) A computation on M is a sequence of pairs ((\u03b7i , xi ))i=0 with a number\nn\nxn+1 , where (\u03b7i )i=0 is a path through M , where x0 \u2208 R\u221e , and where, for\neach i, the following hold:\n(a) If \u03b7i is an input node, xi+1 = gI (xi ).\n(b) If \u03b7i is a computation node, xi+1 = g\u03b7i (xi ).\n(c) If \u03b7i is a branch node, xi+1 = xi and \u03b7i+1 determined by h\u03b7i so that\nif h\u03b7i (xi ) \u2265 0, then \u03b7i+1 is connected to \u03b7i by 1\u03b7i and if h\u03b7i (xi ) < 0,\nthen \u03b7i+1 is connected to \u03b7i by 0\u03b7i . (Note that in all other cases, \u03b7i+1\nis uniquely determined by the definition of path.)\n(d) If \u03b7i is a shift node, xi+1 = \u03c3\u03b7i (xi )\n(e) If \u03b7i is an output node, xi+1 = O\u03b7i (xi ).\nThe proof of the following lemma is an obvious from the definitions.\nLemma 1.3. Given a machine M and an element z \u2208 R\u221e , there is at most one\ncomputation on M with x0 = z.\n\n\fSOME RESULTS ON R-COMPUTABLE STRUCTURES\n\n3\n\nDefinition 1.4. The function \u03c6M : R\u221e \u2192 R\u221e is defined in the following way:\nn\nFor each z \u2208 R\u221e , let \u03c6M (z) be xn+1 , where (((\u03b7i , xi ))i=0 , xn+1 ) is the unique\ncomputation, if any, where x0 = z. If there is no such computation, then \u03c6M is\nundefined on z.\nSince a machine is a finite object, involving finitely many real numbers as parameters, it may be coded by a member of R\u221e .\nDefinition 1.5. If \u03c3 is a code for M , we define \u03c6\u03c3 = \u03c6M .\nWe can now say that a set is computable if and only if its characteristic function\nis \u03c6M for some M .\nExample 1.6. Let R = Z. Now the R-computable functions are exactly the\nclassical Turing-computable functions.\nExample 1.7. Let R = R. Then the Mandelbrot set is not R-computable (see\nChapter 2 of [3]).\nDefinition 1.8. A machine over R with oracle X is exactly like a machine over R,\nexcept that it has an additional type of nodes, the oracle nodes. Each oracle node\nis exactly like a computation node, except that g\u03b7 = \u03c7X . Computations in oracle\nmachines are defined in the obvious way.\nWe say that a set S is decidable (respectively, X-decidable) over R if and only\nif S is both the halting set of an R-machine (respectively, with oracle X) and the\ncomplement of the halting set of an R-machine (respectively, with oracle X). We\nalso say that S is semi-decidable if and only if S is the domain of an R-computable\nfunction (if R is a real closed field, it is equivalent to say that S is the range of\nan R-computable function [3]). Ziegler [29] gives a specialized but recent survey\nof results on R-computation. The following result, first presented by Michaux, but\nproved in detail in [9], is useful in characterizing the decidable and semi-decidable\nsets:\nProposition 1.9. Let S \u2286 R\u221e . Then S is semi-decidable if and only if S is\nthe union of a countable family of semialgebraic sets defined over a single finitely\ngenerated extension of Q.\nThe \"only if\" part of this statement is the upshot of an earlier theorem described\nin [3], called the Path Decomposition Theorem. We can now proceed to define\ncomputable structures.\nDefinition 1.10. Let L = ({Pi }i\u2208IP , {fi }i\u2208If , {ci }i\u2208IC ) be a language with relation\nsymbols {Pi }i\u2208IP , function symbols {fi }i\u2208If , and constant symbols {ci }i\u2208IC . Let\nA be an L-structure with universe A \u2286 R\u221e .\n(1) We say that L is R-computable if the sets of relations, functions, and constants are each decidable over R, and if, in addition, there are R-machines\nwhich will tell, given Pi (respectively, fi ), the arity of Pi (respectively, fi ).\n(2) We identify A with its atomic diagram; in particular,\n(3) We say that A is computable if and only if the atomic diagram of A is\ndecidable.\nThe obstructions to a direct parallel between the theory of R-comptuable structures and that of Turing computable structures which we have encountered so far\nare two in number (one for the parsimonious):\n\n\f4\n\nW. CALVERT AND J. E. PORTER\n\n(1) The real numbers do not admit an \u03c9-like well-ordering to facilitate searching\nor priority constructions, and in particular\n(2) There exist R-computable injective functions whose inverses are not Rcomputable.\n1.2. Plan of the Paper. In the present paper, we will survey recent work on the\ntheory of R-computable structures. In Section 2, we give some basic calculations,\nshowing some parallels with the classical theory, including computable ordinals\n(Section 2.1), satisfaction of computable infinitary formulas (Section 2.2), and the\nuse of forcing to carry out a simple priority construction (Section 2.3). In Section 3,\nwe explore effective categoricity, using vector spaces as an example. In Section 4, we\ndescribe some recent results in effective geometry and topology from the perspective\nof R-computation. In Section 5 we address the relationship of R-computation with\nother models of effective mathematics for uncountable structures. In Section 6 we\nsummarize the state of R-computable model theory and describe some directions\nfor future research.\n2. Basic Results\n2.1. R-computable Ordinals. The Turing computable ordinals constitute a proper\ninitial segment of the countable ordinals [28, 19]. This initial segment includes, for\ninstance, the ordinal \u03c9 \u03c9\ntheorem:\n\n\u03c9\n\n..\n\n.\n\n. In the present section, we will establish the following\n\nTheorem 2.1. A well-ordering (L, <) has an isomorphic copy which is R-computable\nif and only if L is countable.\nProposition 2.2. Every countable well-ordering (M, \u227a) has an isomorphic copy\n(L, <) which is R-computable.\nProof. Since (M, \u227a) is countable, it has an isomorphic copy with universe \u03c9. Now\nD(M ) = {(a, b) \u2208 M 2 |a \u227a b} is a subset of \u03c9 2 . Now we define a real number l in\nthe following way:\nX\n10\u2212i \u03c7D(M) (i).\nl=\ni\u2208\u03c9\n\nThere is a R machine which, given a pair (a, b) \u2208 \u03c9 2 will return the 10\u2212ha,bi place\nof l if that place is 1 and will diverge if that place is 0. This shows that D(M ) is\nthe halting set of a R-computable function, as required.\n\u0003\nProposition 2.3. Suppose (L, <) is a R-computable well-ordering. Then |L| \u2264 \u05d00 .\n\nProof. Since (L, <) is R-computable, the set L< := {(a, b) \u2286 L2 : a < b} is the\nhalting set of a R-machine. By Path Decomposition, it must be a disjoint union\nof semialgebraic sets, and consequently Borel. By the Kunen-Martin Theorem\n(Theorem 31.5 of [17]), analytic (and hence Borel) well-orderings are countable. \u0003\nA rather different proof of Proposition 2.3, using Fubini's Theorem, is possible\nand enlightening.\nProof. Since L< is uncountable and Borel, |L< | = 2\u05d00 . This implies L is Borel\nwith |L| = 2\u05d00 . Without loss of generality, we suppose that L is order isomorphic\nto the cardinal 2\u05d0o ; otherwise, an initial segment of L which was isomorphic to\n\n\fSOME RESULTS ON R-COMPUTABLE STRUCTURES\n\n5\n\nthis cardinal would also be R-computable. In particular, L contains a Cantor set\nC. Fix a Borel measure \u03bc on C such that \u03bc(C) = 1 and extend \u03bc to L by setting\n\u03bc(L \\ C) = 0.\nWe define two auxiliary sets:\nLx\n\n=\n\n{b \u2208 L : (x, b) \u2208 L< }\n\ny\n\n=\n\n{a \u2208 L : (a, y) \u2208 L< }\n\nL\n\nEach of these is a Borel set. For any y, we have |Ly | < 2\u05d00 , since 2\u05d00 is a cardinal\nand Ly is isomorphic to an ordinal less than 2\u05d00 . Since Ly is Borel, we have\n|Ly | = \u05d00 . This implies the set Ly is co-countable for any y.\nR\nSince L< is Borel, we can apply Fubini's theorem to calculate L< 1d\u03bb, where \u03bb\nis the product measure \u03bc \u00d7 \u03bc. On the one hand,\nZ\nZ\nZ Z\nZ\n1(d\u03bc)(d\u03bc) =\n\u03bc(Lx )d\u03bc =\n1d\u03bc = \u03bc(L) = 1\n1d\u03bb =\nL\n\nL<\n\nL\n\nLx\n\nL\n\nsince Lx is co-countable for each x, and thus\nof full measure. On the other hand,\nR\nsince Ly is countable for each y, we have Ly 1dy = 0. Hence\nZ\nZ\nZ Z\nZ\ny\n0d\u03bc = 0,\n\u03bc(L )d\u03bc =\n1(d\u03bc)(d\u03bc) =\n1d\u03bb =\nL<\n\nL\n\nLy\n\nL\n\nwhich is a contradiction.\n\nL\n\n\u0003\n\n2.2. The Complexity of Satisfaction. We define the class of R-computable infinitary formulas. The definition is by analogy with the (Turing) computable infinitary formulas already in broad usage, described in [1]. The choice of computable\ninfinitary formulas is nontrivial, since there are uncountably many R-machines. One\nnatural approach, not pursued here, would be to work in the R-computable fragment of L(2\u05d00 )+ ,\u03c9 . This would certainly be an interesting logic to understand, but\nthe present authors found it more desirable at first to understand the more familiar\nR-computable fragment of L\u03c91 \u03c9 . At issue is which conjunctions and disjunctions\nare allowed in a \"computable\" formula. The logic L\u03c91 \u03c9 allows countable conjunctions and disjunctions, while L(2\u05d00 )+ ,\u03c9 allows any of size at most 2\u05d00 . However, the\ndifficulty of describing what is meant by, for instance, an interval of formulas is a\nmotivation (beyond the avoidance of set-theoretic independence) to consider first\nthe countably long formulas.\nDefinition 2.4. Let L be an R-computable language.\n(1) The \u03a30 formulas of L are exactly the finitary quantifier-free formulas.

Ash showed that\nTuring computable \u03a3\u03b1 formulas defined sets which were \u03a30\u03b1 [1].\nWe will say that a set is semantically R-\u03a3\u03b1 if and only if it is the set of solutions\nto an R-computable \u03a3\u03b1 formula, and similarly for \u03a0\u03b1 . We will say that a set is\ntopologically \u03a30\u03b1 if it is of that level in the standard Borel hierarchy using the order\ntopology on R.\nTheorem 2.5. We characterize the topological structure of sets in the semantic\nhierarchy:\n(1) The semantically R-\u03a30 sets are topologically \u220602 .\n(2) If 0 < \u03b1 < \u03c9, then the semantically R-\u03a3\u03b1 sets are included among the\ntopologically \u03a30\u03b1+1 sets.\n(3) If \u03b1 \u2265 \u03c9, then the semantically R-\u03a3\u03b1 sets are included among the topologically \u03a30\u03b1 sets.\nProof. Since A is a R-computable structure, the semantically R-\u03a30 sets are all\ncountable unions of semialgebraic sets, and the completes of semantically R-\u03a30\nare all countable unions of semialgebraic sets. Since all semialgebraic sets are\ntopologically \u220602 (that is, both topologically \u03a302 and \u03a002 ), the countable unions of\nthem are all topologically \u03a302 . Now if the statement holds for n \u2264 k, it clearly holds\nfor n = k + 1 by the definitions of the various classes involved.\nToward the final statement, notice that the semantically R-\u03a3\u03c9 sets are countable\nunions of sets at lower levels, and are all topologically \u03a3\u03c9 . Above that level, the\ninduction follows exactly as before.\n\u0003\nAt the finite levels, Cucker proved [9] that the union of all the semantically R\u03a3n for n < \u03c9 is the class of Borel sets of finite order. Cucker [9] defined another\narithmetical hierarchy: we call a set computationally \u03a3\u03b1+1 if it can be enumerated\nby a real machine with a computationally \u03a3\u03b1 oracle. In particular, the semidecidable sets are the computationally \u03a31 sets. Cucker proved that for all k < \u03c9,\nthe computationally \u03a3k sets are exactly the semantically R-\u03a3k sets. It seems likely\n\n\fSOME RESULTS ON R-COMPUTABLE STRUCTURES\n\n7\n\nthat this result could be generalized for transfinite \u03b1, but we do not have a proof\nof this.\n2.3. Forcing as a Construction Technique. Aside from the lack of inverse functions, the most difficult part of classical computability theory to get by without is\nthe priority construction. Unless this niche can be filled, we are not optimistic\nconcerning the parallel between Turing-computable structures and R-computable\nstructures. Consequently, although there are ad-hoc methods to construct Rincomparable sets [21], we give an example in this section that is potentially more\neasily generalized.\nProposition 2.6. There exist sets Ao and A1 such that neither is computable by\na R-machine using the other as an oracle.\nProof. The proof will closely follow the second proof given for the classical case by\nLerman [20]. Let (F, \u2264) be the set of pairs of partial functions from R to 2 whose\ncomplement contains an interval, partially ordered by extension in the sense that\n(p0 , p1 ) \u2264 (q0 , q1 ) if and only if pi extends qi for each i. It suffices to satisfy the\nfollowing requirements for every e \u2208 R\u221e :\nPe,i : MeAi 6= A1\u2212i .\nWe say that (p0 , p1 ) Pe,i if there is some x such that either Mepi (x) \u21936= p1\u2212i (x)\nand the latter is defined, or for any p extending Pi , we have Mep \u2191.\nLemma 2.7 (Density Lemma). For any pair (e, i), the set {p \u2208 F : p\ndense.\n\nPe,i } is\n\nProof. Let q = (q0 , q1 ) \u2208 F . We will show that there is some p \u2264 q such that\np Pe,i . Let x be outside the domain of q1\u2212i . If there is no pair s, r such that r\nr\n(x) \u2193, then q Pe,i , so assume that such an s exists. Now we\nextends qi and Me,s\nextend q1\u2212i by setting p1\u2212i = q1\u2212i \u222a {(x, 1 \u2212 Meqi (x))}, and set pi = qi .\n\u0003\nThe following Lemma is the only part of the construction which becomes genuinely more difficult in the uncountable case.\nLemma 2.8 (Existence of a Generic). Let C be the collection of all sets of the\nform {p \u2208 F : p Pe,i }. There exists a C-generic set; that is, a pair of functions\nG = (G0 , G1 ) where Gi : R \u2192 2 such that for each pair (e, i), the function G\nextends some element of F which forces Pe,i .\nProof. Let G0 := (\u2205, \u2205), and well-order the requirements. We define G\u03b1+1 to be the\n\u03b1\nextension\nS of \u03b2G which forces the \u03b1th \u03b1requirement. For limit ordinals \u03b3, we define\n\u03b3\nG . The union of all the G is a C-generic.\n\u0003\nG :=\n\u03b2<\u03b3\n\nOf course, we may take G to be total, by setting all undefined values to 0. Now\nwe take A0 to be the set whose characteristic function is G0 and A1 the set with\ncharacteristic function G1 .\n\u0003\n3. Effective Categoricity\nIt is often possible to produce two classically computable structures which are\nisomorphic, but for which the isomorphism is not witnessed by a computable function. Any theory of effective mathematics must take account of this phenomenon.\n\n\f8\n\nW. CALVERT AND J. E. PORTER\n\nDefinition 3.1. A computable structure M is said to be computably categorical if\nand only if for any computable structure N \u2243 M there is a computable function\n\u2243\nf : N \u2192 M. The number of equivalence classes under computable isomorphism\ncontained in an isomorphism type is called its computable dimension.\nIn the present section, we describe progress toward a parallel to the following\nclassical result:\nTheorem 3.2 (see [26], although it was almost certainly known earlier). If V is a\ncountable vector space over Q,\n(1) There is a Turing-computable copy of V ,\n(2) The categoricity properties are as follows:\n(a) If dim(V ) is finite, then V is computably categorical, and\n(b) If dim(V ) = \u03c9, then the computable dimension of V is \u03c9.\nThe existence part of the theorem is still true without serious modification.\nProposition 3.3. Let n \u2208 \u05d00 \u222a {\u05d00 , 2\u05d00 }. Then there is a R-computable vector\nspace V n of dimension n. Further, V n has a R-computable basis.\nProof. Consider the language of real vector spaces (addition, plus one scaling operation for each element of R). Let {bi : i \u2208 I} be a R-computable set of constants,\nwhere |I| = n. The set of closed terms with constants from {bi : i \u2208 I}, modulo\nprovable equivalence (in the theory of vector spaces) is a model of the theory of\nvector spaces, and has dimension n.\n\u0003\nOf course, the categoricity result highlights an additional concern with R-computation: It may happen that there is a R-computable isomorphism with no Rcomputable inverse. Thus, while the following result establishes, according to Definition 3.1, something very close to part 2a of Theorem 3.2, it falls short of full\nanalogy.\nProposition 3.4. Let n < \u05d00 . Then for any real vector space W of dimension n,\nthere is a computable isomorphism f : V n \u2192 W .\nProof. Let {a1 , . . . , an } be a basis of W . Each member of V n is a R-linear combin\nn\nn\nP\nP\nP\n\u03bbi ai .\n\u0003\n\u03bbi bi to\n\u03bbi bi . We map\nnation\ni=1\n\ni=1\n\ni=1\n\nThe classical way to prove part 2b of Theorem 3.2 is to produce a computable\nvector space with a computable basis, and an isomorphic (i.e. same dimension)\nvector space with no computable basis. Without recourse to priority constructions,\nthis strategy seems, for the present, very difficult in the R-computable context.\n4. Geometry and Topology\nIn the talk by the first author at EMU 2008, an early slide asked for a context\nin which one could formulate effectiveness questions for results like Thom's Theorem on cobordism or the classification of compact 2-manifolds. Some work in the\nintervening months, which began at that meeting, has yielded interesting results in\nR-computable topology.\nAn n-manifold is a topological space which is locally homeomorphic to Rn , satisfying some fairly obvious regularity conditions on the intersections of the neighborhoods on which homeomorphism holds. The following definition is given in\n[8].\n\n\fSOME RESULTS ON R-COMPUTABLE STRUCTURES\n\n9\n\nDefinition 4.1.

The functions i(m, n)\ntell whether Um is a subset of Un and whether Un is a subset of Um . The function\nj(m, n) is the index for a computable map giving the inclusion of Um in Un .\n4.1. Classifying Compact 2-Manifolds. Classification of n-manifolds up to homeomorphism in general is quite difficult. However, a well-known theory of disputed\npriority offers the following classification of compact connected 2-manifolds.\nTheorem 4.2. Let X be a compact connected 2-manifold. Then X is homeomorphic to a connected sum of 2-spheres, copies of RP2 , copies of S 1 \u00d7 S 1 , and copies\nof the Klein Bottle.\nUnpublished work by the first author and Montalban, inspired in part by discussions with R. Miller, gives an effective version of this result.\nTheorem 4.3 (Calvert\u2013Montalban). Let M and N be R-computable compact 2manifolds. Then there is a R-computable homeomorphism f : M \u2192 N .\nProof outline. We can triangulate each of M and N to form a finite simplicial\ncomplex. The function f consists of a mapping on the complexes, with a smoothing\neffect.\n\u0003\nCorollary 4.4. Let X be a compact connected R-computable 2-manifold. Then\nX is homeomorphic by a R-computable function to a connected sum of 2-spheres,\ncopies of RP2 , copies of S 1 \u00d7 S 1 , and copies of the Klein Bottle.\n4.2. Computing Homotopy Groups. One standard set of topological invariants\nfor a manifold M is the sequence of groups (\u03c0n (M ))n\u2208\u03c9 , where \u03c0n (M ) is the group\nof continuous mappings from S n to M , up to homotopy equivalence. Under the\nclassical model of computation, manifolds are often represented by simplicial complexes in order to discuss the possibility of computing various topological invariants.\nBrown showed [5] that there is a procedure which will, given a finite simplicial complex M , compute a set of generators and relations for each of the groups \u03c0n (M ).\nIt is natural to ask, now that we have a notion of computation that gives us algorithmic access to the manifolds themselves, whether this can be computed directly\n\n\f10\n\nW. CALVERT AND J. E. PORTER\n\nfrom the manifolds. We restrict attention here to the case of \u03c01 , studied in detail\nin [8], although it is likely that similar results could be established for \u03c0n .\nLemma 4.5 (Calvert\u2013Miller [8]). Every loop f in a computable manifold M is\nhomotopic to a computable loop in M whose only real parameters are the base point\nand the inclusion functions necessary to define M .\nNevertheless, the answer to the question of computing a fundamental group from\na manifold is largely negative:\nTheorem 4.6 (Calvert\u2013Miller [8]). Let M be a R-computable manifold which is\nconnected but not simply connected. Then there is no algorithm to decide whether\na given loop is nullhomotopic.\nTheorem 4.7 (Calvert\u2013Miller [8]). There is no R-computable function which will\ndecide, given a R-computable manifold, whether that manifold is simply connected.\nNevertheless, there is a canonical family of loops, sufficient to represent the\nwhole (but not recoverable by a uniform procedure) from which we could make the\nnecessary computations for a fundamental group.\nLemma 4.8 (Calvert\u2013Miller [8]). Let M be a R-computable manifold. Then there\nis a R-computable function SM , defined on the naturals, such that the set SM (n)\nconsists of a set of indices for loops and contains exactly one representative from\neach homotopy equivalence type.\nWhile we cannot effectively pass from an index for M to an index for SM , this\nstep includes all of the difficulty in computing \u03c01 (M ):\nTheorem 4.9 (Calvert\u2013Miller [8]). Let M be a R-computable manifold. Then\nthere is a uniform procedure to pass from an index for SM to an index for a realcomputable presentation of the group \u03c01 (M ).\n\n5. Relations with Other Models\n5.1. Local Computability. Let T be a \u2200-axiomatizable theory in a language with\nn symbols.\nDefinition 5.1.

A structure S is locally computable if and only if it has\na uniformly computable simple cover.\nProposition 5.4 ([22]). The ordered field of real numbers is not locally computable.\nHowever, the ordered field of real numbers is trivially R-computable. It appears\nat first that the ordering might be essential in escaping local computability.\nDefinition 5.5. A R-machine is said to be equational if and only if each branch\nnode is decided by a polynomial equation. We call a structure equationally Rcomputable if its diagram is computable by an equational R-machine.\nLemma 5.6 (Path Decomposition for Equational Machines). Let M be an equational R-machine. Then the halting set of M is a countable disjoint union of algebraic sets.\nProof. The proof is exactly the same as for normal R-machines.\n\n\u0003\n\nCorollary 5.7. The ordered field of real numbers is not equationally R-computable.\nTheorem 5.8. There is an equationally R-computable structure which is not locally\ncomputable.\nProof. Let S be a noncomputable set of natural numbers, and denote by Cn a cyclic\ngraph on n vertices (i.e. an n-gon). Now let G be the structure given by\n!\n!\n[\n[ [\n* C2n+1 .\n* C2n *\nn\u2208S\n\nn\u2208S\n/\n\nTo show that G is equationally R-computable, we observe that the disjoint union\nof two R-computable structures is R-computable (since the same is true of the cardinal sum). However, each of the graphs Ck has a R-computable copy by Lagrange\ninterpolation.\n\n\f12\n\nW. CALVERT AND J. E. PORTER\n\nSuppose f is a uniform computable enumeration of the finitely generated substructures of G. Then we could compute whether n \u2208 S by searching the structures\nindexed by f (t) for successive t until we see a substructure of type C2n or of type\nC2n+1 . Since S is noncomputable, no such f can exist, so that G is not locally\ncomputable.\n\u0003\nTheorem 5.9. There is a locally computable structure which is not R-computable.\nProof. Let X be the set of all countable graphs with universe \u03c9, and let E be the\nisomorphism relation on X. Now E is complete analytic [13], so F = E c is complete\nco-analytic. Now for any x \u2208 X, we have \u00acxF x, and for any x, y \u2208 X we have xF y\nif and only if yF x. Thus, F defines the adjacency relation of a graph on X. Let X\ndenote the graph (X, F ).\nNow X is not real-computable, since its diagram is complete co-analytic (contradicting path decomposition). We will show that X is locally computable. Now\nthe finitely generated substructures of X are all finite graphs, and it only remains\nto determine which finite graphs are included. Let T be the following graph:\nr\n\nr\nr\n\nLet G be a finite T -free graph. We will show that G embeds in X . Let G =\n({0, . . . , n}, G). We will define an equivalence structure R with universe N =\n{0, . . . , n}. For x, y \u2208 N , we say that xRy if and only if \u00acxGy. This relation R will\nbe reflexive and symmetric. Since G is T -free, R will also be transitive. Now since\nthe isomorphism relation is Borel complete [13], there is a function f : N \u2192 X\nsuch that xRy if and only if f (x)Ef (y). This function can also be required to be\ninjective [16].\nNow let \u03a6 be a computable Friedberg enumeration of finite graphs up to isomorphism (i.e. a total computable function whose range consists of an index for\nexactly one representative from each isomorphism class of finite graphs). Such an\nenumeration was given in [7]. We will define a Friedberg enumeration \u03a8 of finite\nT -free graphs up to isomorphism as follows: \u03a8(x) will be \u03a6(x\u2032 ) for the least x\u2032 such\nthat \u03a6(x\u2032 ) is T -free and \u03a6(x\u2032 ) \u2208\n/ ran(\u03a8|x ). Since all of the graphs are finite, we can\neffectively check whether each is T -free, so that \u03a8 is computable. Now \u03a8 provides\na uniform simple computable cover for X .\n\u0003\nCorollary 5.10. There is another structure X\u0303 with the same uniform simple computable cover as X , such that X\u0303 is R-computable.\nProof. Let X \u0303 be the disjoint union\n[\n* \u03a8(x).\n\nx\u2208\u03c9\n\nNow X\u0303 is countable, and so is trivially R-computable.\n\n\u0003\n\nOne can say more about the structure described in Theorem 5.9. The structure\nsatisfies a stronger condition called perfectly local computability. We recall the\ndefinition of perfectly locally computable and leave the details to the reader.\n\n\fSOME RESULTS ON R-COMPUTABLE STRUCTURES\n\n13\n\nDefinition 5.11.

S is then said to be perfectly locally computable with perfect cover U.\n5.2. \u03a3-Definability. The following definition is standard, and appears in equivalent forms in [2] and [10].\nDefinition 5.12. Given a structure M with universe M , we define a new structure\nHF (M) as follows.\n(1) The universe of HF (M) is the union of the chain HFn (M ) defined as\nfollows:\n(a) HF0 (M ) = M\n(b) HFn+1 (M ) = P <\u03c9 (M \u222a HFn (M )), where P <\u03c9 (S) is the set of all\nfinite subsets of S\n(2) The language for HF (M) consists of a unary predicate U for HF0 (M ),\nas well as a predicate \u2208 interpreted as membership, plus a symbol \u03c3 \u2217 for\neach symbol \u03c3 of the language of M, given the interpretation of \u03c3 on\nM = HF0 (M ).\nErshov gave a definition [10] of a notion generalizing computability to structures\nother than N. We will first give Barwise's definition [2] of the class of \u03a3-formulas.\nDefinition 5.13. The class of \u03a3-formulas are defined by induction.\n(1) Each \u22060 formula is a \u03a3-formula.\n(2) If \u03a6 and \u03a8 are \u03a3-formulas, then so are (\u03a6 \u2227 \u03a8) and (\u03a6 \u2228 \u03a8).\n(3) For each variable x and each term t, if \u03a6 is a \u03a3-formula, then the following\nare also \u03a3-formulas:\n(a) \u2203(x \u2208 t) \u03a6\n(b) \u2200(x \u2208 t) \u03a6, and\n(c) \u2203x\u03a6.\nA predicate S is called a \u2206-predicate if both S and its complement are defined\nby \u03a3-formulas.\nDefinition 5.14. Let M and N = (N, P0 , P1 , . . . ) be structures. We say that N is\n\u03a3-definable in HF (M) if and only if there are \u03a3-formulas \u03a80 , \u03a81 , \u03a8\u22171 , \u03a60 , \u03a6\u22170 , \u03a61 , \u03a6\u22171 , . . .\nsuch that\n\n\f14\n\nW.

The structures which have isomorphic copies \u03a3definable over HF (R) are exactly the ones which have isomorphic copies which are\nR-computable.\n\nAn interesting consequense of this (an immediate corollary of Theorem 5.15 and\na result of Morozov and Korovina [23]) gives a sense in which some R-computable\nstructures can be approximated by classically computable structures.\nDefinition 5.16. Let A and B be structures in a common signature. We write\nthat A \u22641 B if A is a substructure of B, and for all existential formulas \u03c6(x\u0304) and\nfor all tuples \u0101 \u2286 A, we have\nB |= (\u03c6(\u0101) \u21d2 A |= \u03c6(\u0101).\nCorollary 5.17. For any R-computable structure M whose defining machine involves only algebraic reals as parameters, there is a computable structure M\u2217 such\nthat M\u2217 \u22641 M.\n5.3. F-Parameterizability. Morozov introduced a concept that he called F -parameterizability in order to understand the elementary substructure relation on both\nautomorphism groups and the structure of hereditarily finite sets over a given structure [25]. In a talk at Stanford University, though, he identified this notion as one\n\"which generalizes the notion of computable\" [24].\nDefinition\n\u0001 5.18 ([25]). Let M be a structure in a finite relational language\nPnkn )n\u2264k . We say that M is F -parameterizable if and only if there is an injection \u03be : M \u2192 \u03c9 \u03c9 with the following properties:\n(1) The image of \u03be is analytic\nin the Baire space, oand\nn\n(2) For each n, the set (\u03be(ai ))i\u2264kn : M |= Pn (\u0101)\n\nis analytic.\n\nThe function \u03be is called an F -parameterization of M. Morozov also introduced\nthe following stronger condition, essentially requiring that M be able to define its\nown F -parameterization.\n\nDefinition 5.19 ([25]). Let M be an F -parameterizable structure. We say that\nM is weakly selfparameterizable if and only if there are functions \u039e, p : M\u00d7\u03c9 \u2192 \u03c9,\nboth definable without parameters in HF (M), with the following properties:\n(1) For all x \u2208 M and all m \u2208 \u03c9, we have \u039e(x, m) = \u03be(x)[m], and\n(2) For all f \u2208 \u03c9 \u03c9 there is some x \u2208 M such that for all n \u2208 \u03c9 we have\np(x, n) = f (n).\nIn making sense of effectiveness on uncountable structures, a major motivation\nis to describe a sense in which real number arithmetic - an operation that, while\nnot Turing computable, does not seem horribly ineffective - can be considered to\nbe effective.\n\n\fSOME RESULTS ON R-COMPUTABLE STRUCTURES\n\n15\n\nProposition 5.20 (Morozov [25]). The real field is weakly F -selfparameterizable.\nOutline of proof. Define a function \u03be : R \u2192 \u03c9 \u03c9 maps x to its decimal expansion.\nThis function is definable without parameters in HF (R), in the sense required by\nDefinition 5.19.\n\u0003\nTheorem 5.21 (Calvert [6]). Every R-computable structure is F -parameterizable.\nOn the other hand, the structure (R, +, *, 0, 1, ex) is weakly F -selfparameterizable\nbut not R-computable.\n6. Conclusion\nWe state here some open problems arising from issues discussed in the present\npaper. The first is perhaps the most vital.\nProblem 6.1. Develop a substitute for the priority method which is capable of\nhandling constructions with injury.\nQuestion 6.2. Is it true that for any R-computable finite dimensional R-vector\nspaces M and N with the same dimension, there is a R-computable isomorphism\nfrom M to N ?\nConjecture 6.3. A R-computable R-vector space of dimension greater than \u05d00 is\nnot R-computably categorical.\nWe would also like to know about the categoricity of vector spaces of dimension\n\u05d00 , but are not ready to hazard a conjecture at this time.\nQuestion 6.4. Does there exist a R-computable Banach space of infinite dimension in the language of vector spaces, augmented by a sort for R and a function\ninterpreted as the norm?\nQuestion 6.5. Does there exist a R-computable Hilbert space of infinite dimension\nin the language of vector spaces, augmented by a sort for R and a binary function\ninterpreted as the inner product?\nOn each of the previous two questions, the authors had difficulty guaranteeing\ncompleteness.\nReferences\n1.
