These scattering amplitudes are ultimately\ndetermined by the underlying theory of quarks and gluons known as QCD. Our best current general-purpose\ntechnique for computation of quantities in QCD is lattice QCD, which considers the field theory numerically\non a grid of Euclidean space-time points of finite extent.\nScattering amplitudes are not directly accessible in the\nEuclidean theory, but computations of the discrete spectrum of states in a finite volume offer a way to access\nscattering amplitudes through a formalism presented by\nL\u00fcscher[1]. Within this framework, narrow meson resonances appear through admixtures of localised singlehadron states, which are interpolated well from the vacuum by local q q\u0304-like operators, and meson-meson states\nhaving definite relative momentum determined by the\nfinite-volume boundary conditions.\nIn order to accurately extract a complete finite-volume\nmeson spectrum, it is necessary to include in a basis of\ninterpolating fields not just local operators resembling\nsingle-hadron states, but also some which resemble pairs\nof mesons projected into definite relative momentum.\nOur desire then is to form operators that can interpolate\nthe meson-meson pair MA MB which will be of the form\nOMA (~\np)OMB (~\np 0 ), where OMA (~\np) efficiently interpolates\nmeson MA with momentum p~ (and similarly OMB (~\np 0)\nefficiently interpolates meson MB ). An optimal operator for MA with momentum p~ follows from variational\ndiagonalisation of a matrix of single-hadron correlators\nevaluated with a basis of suitable operators. The subsequent reduction of the contribution of excited MA? mesons\n\n\u2217\n\nthomasc@jlab.org\n\nto the MA MB correlators will mean that the relevant energy levels, and hence signals for scattering, can be extracted at earlier Euclidean times where statistical noise\nis smaller.\nThis suggests that we need to develop a basis of singlehadron interpolating fields having non-zero momentum.\nIn lattice QCD this cannot be achieved by simply Lorentz\nboosting operators at rest, as one is required to take into\naccount the reduced symmetry of a discrete grid of finite\nextent. The lattice discretisation breaks rotational symmetry at small distances, while the finite volume breaks\nrotational symmetry at large distances. The latter is of\nfundamental importance for states at non-zero momentum because the allowed momenta are determined by the\nboundary conditions which implement the symmetry of\nthe \"box\". The relationship between the discrete finitevolume energy spectrum and the infinite volume scattering amplitudes is also determined by the symmetry of the\nboundary. In most lattice QCD calculations, including\nthose presented in this paper, both the lattice discretisation and the box have the same cubic symmetry, but\nthis need not necessarily be so. For mesons in flight, the\nsymmetry is further reduced to the little group of allowed\ncubic rotations that leave the meson momentum invariant and it is operators transforming irreducibly under\nthis reduced symmetry group that we will derive.\nAs well as their use in constructing meson-meson operators, in-flight meson interpolators play a significant\nrole in computations of meson matrix elements of certain\ncurrents, such as those used to measure electromagnetic\nand weak form-factors. Including operators which interpolate mesons at non-zero momentum increases the number of kinematic points available, allowing the form factor to be calculated at more Q2 values. These quantities\ncan reveal information about the quark-gluon structure\nof hadrons [2, 3].\nWe will build on recent success[4] in constructing a\nbasis of meson interpolators at rest that transform irre-\n\n\f2\nducibly under the cubic symmetry of the lattice. It was\nfound that on the dynamical lattices of Refs. [5, 6], the\neffect of the finite lattice spacing was relatively small;\noperators subduced from definite continuum spin into irreducible representations of the octahedral group overlapped with states in a manner compatible with an effectively restored rotational symmetry. The observed spectrum of states was explained in terms of single-meson\nstates of determined J P C with Jz values subduced across\ncubic irreps, and, as expected for a calculation featuring\nonly fermion-bilinear operators, there was no clear observation of a spectrum of meson-meson states whose distribution across irreps is determined by the symmetry of\nthe finite-volume boundary conditions.\nIn this article we follow a similar philosophy, constructing fermion-bilinear operators for mesons in flight which,\nhaving a clear interpretation in an infinite volume continuum, allow the continuum quantum numbers of singlehadron states to be identified. We then demonstrate the\neffectiveness of these constructions by using them to extract an extensive spectrum of isovector mesons in flight\nat various momenta, with the continuum spins and parities reliably identified. With the extracted spectrum\nviewed in the finest detail we will observe effects that\nmay be compatible with the admixture of meson-meson\nstates. We propose that by including meson-meson operators constructed from products of the in-flight operators\nderived herein, in future calculations we will be able to resolve this admixture precisely and extract meson-meson\nscattering information. While Ref. [1] considered only\nthe case of the total system at rest, it has been shown\nthat more information can be gained from calculations\nthat work in a moving frame[7, 8].\nWe begin in Section II by considering an infinite volume continuum, constructing helicity operators and discussing operator-state overlaps. In Section III we move\nto a finite volume, showing how these operators subduce into lattice little group irreducible representations\nto give subduced helicity operators. After giving a brief\ndescription of the lattice data sets used and the computational method in Section IV, in Section V we describe the\nmethod for identifying the J P C of extracted states and\nshow some examples of its application. The extracted\nspin-identified spectra of mesons in flight are given in\nSection VI and we conclude in Section VIII.\n\nduced into the irreducible representations relevant for a\ncubic lattice in a finite cubic volume, and how, because\nthey have a definite infinite volume interpretation, they\nenable the identification of the spin and parity of states.\nAs a starting point, consider the fermion-bilinear operators constructed in Ref. [4], referring to that reference\nfor more details,\nX\n\nOJ,M (~\np) \u223c\n\nm1 ,m2 ,m3 ,...\n\nCGs(m1 , m2 , m3 , . . .)\n\nX\n\nei~p*~x\n\n~\nx\n\n\u2190\n\u2192 \u2190\n\u2192\n\u00d7 \u03c8\u0304(~x, t)\u0393m1 D m2 D m3 . . . \u03c8(~x, t) . (1)\n\u2190\n\u2192\n\u2190\n\u2212 \u2192\n\u2212\nHere D \u2261 D \u2212 D is a gauge-covariant derivative, \u0393 is\nany product of Dirac gamma matrices, \u03c8 is a quark field\n(smeared using distillation in our implementation) and\nspin, flavour and colour indices have been suppressed for\nclarity. As described in [4], the vector-like gamma matrices and derivatives are expressed in a circular basis\nand then coupled together using standard SU (2) Clebsch Gordan coefficients (represented by \"CGs\" in Eq. 1)\nto form the operator OJ,M (~\np). However, for consistency\nbetween the operator constructions below and conventional definitions for helicity states, here we use a slightly\ndifferent circular basis compared to that reference,\nX\n\u2190\n\u2192\n\u2190\n\u2192\n\u2192\n\u2190\n\u2192 \u0011\ni \u0010\u2190\nD \u00b11 = i\n\u03b5\u2217i (~0, \u00b11) D i = \u2213 \u221a\nDx \u2213iDy ,\n2\ni\nX\n\u2190\n\u2192\n\u2190\n\u2192\n\u2190\n\u2192\nD0 = i\n\u03b5\u2217i (~0, 0) D i = i D z ,\n(2)\ni\n\nand similarly for the vector-like gamma matrices. Here\n\u03b5i (~0, m) is the polarisation vector, given in Appendix B,\nfor a spin-one meson at rest with spin z-component m.\nWith full continuum rotational symmetry and p~ = ~0,\nthese operators have definite spin (J), spin z-component\n(M ) and parity, P (determined by the choice of \u0393 and the\nnumber of derivatives), i.e. they only overlap with states\nhaving these quantum numbers. In addition, if \u03c8 and \u03c8\u0304\ncorrespond to quarks of the same flavour, these operators\nhave definite charge conjugation parity C (determined\nby the choice of \u0393, the number of derivatives and how\nthese derivatives are coupled together), generalising to\nG-parity as appropriate. In the continuum the overlap of\nthese operators with states is given by\n0 OJ,M (~\np = ~0) p~ = ~0; J 0 , M 0 = Z [J] \u03b4J,J 0 \u03b4M,M 0 , (3)\n\nII.\n\nA.\n\nMESONS IN FLIGHT IN AN INFINITE\nVOLUME\nHelicity operators for mesons in flight\n\nWe begin by describing the construction of helicity operators which enable the energies of mesons in flight to\nbe extracted in an infinite volume continuum, before considering the overlap of these operators with states. In\nSection III we will show how these operators can be sub-\n\nwhere the conserved parity and charge conjugation parity\nquantum numbers have been suppressed.\nAt non-zero momentum, the spin z-component M is\nnot a good quantum number unless the momentum is directed along the z-axis; in general, Eq. 3 is not applicable to p~ 6= ~0. It is more convenient to consider operators\nwith definite helicity, the projection of the spin component along the direction of p~. In Appendix A we show\nthat, in analogy to the transformation from basis states\nwith definite spin z-component to helicity states, helicity\n\n\f3\noperators can be constructed by\nX (J)\u2217\nOJ,\u03bb (~\np) =\nDM \u03bb (R) OJ,M (~\np) ,\n\n(4)\n\nM\n(J)\n\nwhere OJ,\u03bb is a helicity operator with helicity \u03bb, DM \u03bb (R)\nis a Wigner-D matrix, and R is the (active) transformation that rotates (0, 0, |~\np|) to p~. Note that in general\nthere are an infinite number of R which rotate (0, 0, |~\np|)\nto p~.1 There is some subtlety in the appropriate choice of\nR when the symmetry is reduced (e.g. on a finite volume\nlattice with a finite lattice spacing) and we discuss this\nbelow in Section III.\nAn equivalent way to construct these operators would\nbe to choose an initial circular basis for the vectorlike gamma matrices and derivatives defined in terms\nof the component of spin along p~ instead of the spin\nz-component. These vectors could then be coupled together using the standard SU (2) Clebsch Gordan coefficients as described above. This emphasises that by\nconstructing helicity operators we've just effected a basis\nchange. As will be illustrated below, the resulting basis is\nmuch more convenient for studying mesons with non-zero\nmomenta because it respects the symmetries of a system\nwith a meson in flight and helicity is a good quantum\nnumber (in an infinite volume continuum).\nB.\n\nHelicity operator overlaps\n\nHere we discuss the overlap of helicity states\nonto the helicity\noperators constructed above,\n0\np) p~; J 0P , \u03bb0 , still considering an infinite\n0 OJ,P,\u03bb (~\nvolume continuum.\nThe overlaps for operators with p~ = ~0 have a simple\nform, Eq. 3, J 0 = J, P 0 = P and \u03bb0 = \u03bb. These constraints arise from the rotational symmetry in 3 spatial\ndimensions of a system containing a particle at rest, and\nno further constraints are gained by imposing Lorentz\nsymmetry2 . This can be seen explicitly by comparing the\nLorentz covariant parameterisations given in Appendix\nA of Ref. [11] and the 3-rotation covariant parameterisations given in Appendix D herein. However, at finite momentum, 3-rotation symmetry, a subgroup of full Lorentz\nsymmetry, provides less stringent constraints, something\nthat can again be seen explicitly by comparing those two\n\n1\n\n2\n\nIf (\u03c6, \u03b8, \u03c8) represents a rotation around the z-axis by \u03c8 followed\nby a rotation around the y-axis by \u03b8 and finally a rotation around\nthe z-axis by \u03c6, one convention is R = (\u03c6, \u03b8, 0) [9] and another,\nthe Jacob-Wick convention [10], is R = (\u03c6, \u03b8, \u2212\u03c6). Including an\nadditional arbitrary initial rotation \u03c8 will still give a rotation\nfrom (0, 0, |~\np|) to p\n~. Different conventions will lead to different\nphases in the definition of states and operators.\nAlthough Lorentz symmetry constraints would relate operators\ncontaining the temporal and spatial pieces of Lorentz vectors,\ne.g. \u03b3 0 and \u03b3 i .\n\ndifferent parameterisations. Since in the operator constructions we treat space and time asymmetrically, we\nwill consider in the detail the restricted 3-rotational symmetry constraints.\nUsing only the constraints arising from 3-rotation symmetry, the overlap of a state of definite J P (P, P 0 are the\nparities at rest) and helicity onto a helicity operator is\ngiven by\n0\n\np) p~; J 0P , \u03bb0 = Z [J,J\n0 OJ,P,\u03bb (~\n\n0\n\n,P,P 0 ,\u03bb]\n\n\u03b4\u03bb,\u03bb0 .\n\n(5)\n\n0\n\nThe helicity of the state, \u03bb , is constrained to be the same\nof that of the operator, \u03bb, but an operator constructed\nto have integer spin J at rest can in general overlap onto\nstates of any integer spin J 0 when boosted to non-zero\nmomentum. This is because at non-zero momentum the\n3-dimensional rotational group is broken to a subgroup,\ncalled the little group, made up of the rotations and reflections which leave the momentum, p~, invariant. In an\ninfinite volume continuum the little group is U(1) [12, 13],\nthe group of rotations and reflections in two dimensions,\nregardless of the momentum direction. The irreducible\nrepresentations of this little group are labelled by the\nmagnitude of helicity (and also, for \u03bb = 0, a 'parity',\n\u03b7\u0303, described below): |\u03bb|\u03b7\u0303 = 0+ , 0\u2212 , 21 , 1, 23 , 2, 25 , 3, . . . .\nApart from the two one-dimensional irreps with \u03bb = 0,\nthese irreps are all two-dimensional. Another consequence of this reduced symmetry is that an operator\nwith |\u03bb| =\n6 0 can overlap with states of both parities,\nand the overlap factors, Z, can depend on \u03bb. In Appendix D we give the most general parameterisations of\nthese operator-state overlaps and these features can be\nseen explicitly. Note that any flavour quantum number,\nsuch as charge conjugation parity or its generalisation, is\nstill a good quantum number if it is so at rest.\nHelicity states at non-zero momentum are not eigenstates of parity because a parity transformation, P\u0302 , reverses the direction of the momentum, p~ \u2192 \u2212~\np. A reflection in a plane containing the momentum direction, \u03a0\u0302\n(a parity transformation followed by a rotation to bring\nthe momentum direction back to the original direction),\npreserves p~. However, helicity states are also in general\nnot eigenstates of \u03a0\u0302 because under such a transformation\n\u03bb \u2192 \u2212\u03bb. If we consider a state with p~ = p~z along the\nz-axis and a reflection in the yz plane (x \u2192 \u2212x), \u03a0\u0302yz ,\nthen we have (Appendix A 1)\n\u03a0\u0302yz p~z ; J P , \u03bb = \u03b7\u0303 p~z ; J P , \u2212\u03bb ,\nwhere J P are the quantum numbers of the state at rest\nand \u03b7\u0303 \u2261 P (\u22121)J . It can be seen that for \u03bb = 0 the\nhelicity states are eigenstates of \u03a0\u0302 with eigenvalue \u03b7\u0303 and\ntherefore3\n0\n\n0 OJ,P,\u03bb=0 (~\np) p~; J 0P , \u03bb0 =\nZ [J,J\n\n3\n\n0\n\n,P,P 0 ,\u03bb=0]\n\n\u03b4\u03b7\u0303,\u03b7\u03030 \u03b4\u03bb0 ,0 .\n\n(6)\n\nand because \u03bb = 0 there is no additional phase depending on the\nchoice of reflection plane (Appendix A 1)\n\n\f4\nFor \u03bb 6= 0 the helicity states are not eigenstates of \u03a0\u0302 4 .\nIf we had started with Lorentz 4-vector gamma matrices and derivatives instead of 3-vectors, we could have\nconstructed operators which only overlap onto states\nwith one J P at non-zero momentum. Performing a\nLorentz boost on the state and operator on the left-hand\nside of Eq. 3 would leave the right-hand side unchanged,\nor putting it slightly differently, we can always boost\nback to the rest frame where Eq. 3 is valid. However,\nour use of only spatial derivatives precludes us from doing this. We do not include temporal derivatives in our\noperator constructions because in distillation the quark\nfields in the operators are only smeared in the spatial\ndirections. This means that we can not form a latticediscretised temporal derivative which is simply a rotation\nof a lattice-discretised spatial derivative. In addition, we\nhave used anisotropic lattices and smeared differently in\nthe temporal direction in the action, and these lead to\nsimilar problems. If we naively included temporal derivatives, these would be on a different footing to the spatial\nderivatives and so the resulting operators would not be\nLorentz covariant and would overlap onto more than one\nJ P at non-zero momentum.\nAlthough our operators (and hence the operator-state\noverlaps) are not Lorentz covariant because they have\nbeen built from 3-vectors, in a theory with Lorentz symmetry there are still more stringent constraints on the\noverlaps than those given in Eq. 5. In Appendix D we\nshow the restrictions on state-operator overlaps which\narise from the constraints of a Lorentz symmetric theory\napplied to our helicity operators. The J P of the states\nwith which the operator has non-zero overlap depends\non which gamma matrices and derivatives the operator\nis constructed from and how these have been coupled together. An operator which at rest overlaps with only one\nJ P can in general overlap with states of many J P at nonzero momentum, but the set of allowed J P is reduced by\nLorentz symmetry constraints compared to the infinite\nset allowed by 3-rotation symmetry, Eq. 5.\nTo illustrate the above points, consider a simple example where the fermion bilinear operator consists of a\nspatial gamma matrix in the Cartesian basis and there\nare no derivatives. Projected onto zero momentum, this\noperator, Oi = \u03c8\u0304\u03b3i \u03c8, has non-zero overlap with only the\nvector state, J P C = 1\u2212\u2212 ,\n0 Oi (~\np = ~0) p~ = ~0; 1\u2212\u2212 (M ) = Z\u03b5i (~\np = ~0, M ) ,\n\n5\n\n0 Oi (p~z ) p~ = p~z ; 0+\u2212 = Z0 pi ,\n0 Oi (p~z ) p~ = p~z ; 1\u2212\u2212 (M ) = Z1 \u03b5i + Z10 (\u03b5j pj )pi ,\n0 Oi (p~z ) p~ = p~z ; 1+\u2212 (M ) = Z2 \u000fijk pj \u03b5k .\nHowever, in a theory with Lorentz symmetry most of\nthese overlaps are constrained to be zero. For example,\nthere are no Lorentz covariant structures that reduce to\nthe Z10 [(\u03b5j pj )pi ] or Z2 [\u000fijk pj \u03b5k ] terms above. In this\ncase the operator has non-zero overlap with only two\nstates (shown in the column labelled \"L1\" in the aforementioned table),\n0 Oi (p~z ) p~ = p~z ; 0+\u2212 \u221d pi ,\n0 Oi (p~z ) p~ = p~z ; 1\u2212\u2212 (M ) \u221d \u03b5i (~\np, M ) .\nIf instead we consider the Lorentz covariant operator\nO\u03bc = \u03c8\u0304\u03b3\u03bc \u03c8, the non-zero overlaps are\n0 O\u03bc (p~z ) p~ = p~z ; 0+\u2212 \u221d p\u03bc ,\n0 O\u03bc (p~z ) p~ = p~z ; 1\u2212\u2212 (M ) \u221d \u03b5\u03bc (~\np, M ) .\nIn this case we can take linear combinations of the four\ncomponents to project onto just one of the states: taking the inner product with p\u03bc projects onto the 0+\u2212\nstate, whereas taking the inner product with \u03b5\u2217\u03bc (~\np, M 0 )\n0\n\u2212\u2212\nprojects onto the M = M component of the 1\nstate\nonly.\nIn summary, although simplified somewhat by using\nhelicity operators, the pattern of operator-state overlaps\nat non-zero momentum is more complicated than at zero\nmomentum. In particular, because we construct operators out of 3-vectors rather than Lorentz 4-vectors, we\ncan not in general form operators that have non-zero\noverlap with states of only one J P . However, as we shall\nshow in Section V, the remaining constraints prove to be\nenough for us to be able to identify the states' spins and\nparities. In the following section we consider complications arising from a finite cubic volume.\nIII.\n\nMESONS IN FLIGHT AND HELICITY\nOPERATORS ON THE LATTICE\n\n(7)\n\nwhere \u03b5i is the polarisation vector of the state and M is\nits spin z-component. Now consider a non-zero momentum along the positive z-axis5 , p~z = (0, 0, p). In a theory\n\n4\n\nwith only 3-rotation symmetry and not full Lorentz symmetry, the state-operator overlaps are given in the last\ncolumn of Table XI in Appendix D, i.e. the operator has\nnon-zero overlap with states of all integer J. For states\nwith J = 0, 1 the overlaps are6\n\nalthough we can form eigenstates by taking linear combinations,\n\u223c |~\np; J, \u03bbi \u00b1 \u03b7\u0303|~\np; J, \u2212\u03bbi, they are of limited use here.\nchosen to be along the z-axis so that the helicity state/operator\nis the same Jz state/operator\n\nIn general, the symmetry of the lattice discretisation\n(which breaks rotational symmetry at small distances)\nneed not be the same as the symmetry of the finite volume, the boundary conditions (which break rotational\nsymmetry at large distances).

Allowed lattice momenta on a cubic lattice in a\nfinite cubic box, along with the corresponding little groups\n(the double covers relevant for integer and half-integer spin)\nfrom Ref. [12, 13]. We list only the single cover irreps relevant for integer spin. Lattice momenta are given in units\nof 2\u03c0/(Ls as ) where n, m, p \u2208 Z\u2217 are non-zero integers with\nn 6= m 6= p. The A and B irreps have dimension one, E two\nand T three. Dicn is the dicyclic group of order 4n.\n\nonly consider a cubic lattice in a finite cubic box with periodic boundary conditions, and so both the lattice and\nthe boundary have the same symmetry. In this case,\nthe full rotational symmetry of the continuum is broken to the (double cover) of the octahedral group, OD\nh,\nequivalent to the (double cover) of the symmetry group\nof the cube. Spin is no longer a good quantum number and states are not classified by J but instead by\nthe irreducible representations, irreps (\u039b), of OhD . In\nRefs. [4, 14], it was found that on the dynamical lattices of Refs. [5, 6], the effect of the finite lattice spacing\nwas relatively small. Operators with definite continuum\nspin (Eq. 1) were subduced into octahedral group irreps;\nthe observed spectrum of states and operator-state overlaps were compatible with an effective restoration of rotational symmetry, and the spectrum was explained in\nterms of single-meson states of determined J P C with Jz\nvalues subduced across these irreps.\nIn going from zero momentum to non-zero momentum\nthe symmetry is broken further. Whereas, in an infinite\nvolume continuum the little group is the same regardless\nof the momentum direction, p~, in a finite volume the particular lattice little group depends on the star of p~ [12].\nThe allowed p~ are determined by the boundary conditions\nand the star of p~ is the set of all p~ related by allowed lattice rotations; as a shorthand, we refer to these different\nstars as different momentum types. Momenta are quantised by the periodic boundary conditions on the cubic\nbox and we give all momenta in units of L2\u03c0\n; as and\ns as\nLs are respectively the spatial lattice spacing and spatial extent of the lattice in lattice units. The relevant\nlittle groups are given in Refs. [12, 13]. We summarise\nthe allowed lattice momenta and the corresponding little\ngroups and irreps in Table I.\nIn analogy to Ref. [4], we consider subduction coeffi\u03b7\u0303,\u03bb\ncients, S\u039b,\u03bc\n, which specify how the helicity, \u03bb, subduces\ninto a little group irrep \u039b (row \u03bc = 1 . . . dim[\u039b]). Using\nthese we can construct a little group operator, a subduced\n\nhelicity operator, from a helicity operator:\n[J,P,|\u03bb|]\n\nO\u039b,\u03bc\n\n(~\np) =\n\nX\n\n\u03b7\u0303,\u03bb\u0302 J,P,\u03bb\u0302\nS\u039b,\u03bc\nO\n(~\np) ,\n\n(8)\n\n\u03bb\u0302=\u00b1|\u03bb|\n\nwhere \u03b7\u0303 \u2261 P (\u22121)J with J and P the spin and parity of\nthe operator OJ,P,\u03bb (~\np = ~0). The subduced helicity operators are different orthogonal combinations of the two\nsigns of helicity, +|\u03bb| and \u2212|\u03bb|. These subduction coefficients can be calculated using the group theoretic projection formula (for example, see Appendix A of Ref. [4]).\nIn Table II we give these subduction coefficients7 for\nmomenta of the form (n, 0, 0), (n, n, 0) and (n, n, n)\n(n \u2208 Z\u2217 ) for |\u03bb| \u2264 4. More details of our conventions\nare given in Appendix C. For all these momenta, \u03bb\u03b7\u0303 =\n0+ and 0\u2212 subduce onto the A1 and A2 irreps respectively. However, the other \u03bb contained in those irreps\n(i.e. which \u03bb can mix with \u03bb = 0) depends on the\nmomentum type: (n, 0, 0) (Dic4 ) also has \u03bb = \u00b14, . . . ;\n(n, n, 0) (Dic2 ) has \u03bb = \u00b12, \u00b14, . . . ; (n, n, n) (Dic3 ) has\n\u03bb = \u00b13, . . . . Note that, although the pattern of subductions does not depend on conventions, the relative phases\nin subduction coefficients can be convention dependent,\ndetermined by the helicity operator construction, the rotations used (discussed below) and the particular representation matrices chosen for the two-dimensional irreps.\nInstead of constructing little group operators via helicity operators which are then subduced into little group\nirreps, we could have projected directly from our continuum operators (in the Jz basis) into these little group\nirreps, but the subduction coefficients would then in general depend on the momentum direction and not just the\nmomentum type. Alternatively, we could have worked\nonly in terms of lattice irreps, subducing from octahedral group irreps to lattice little group irreps. However,\nthe method we have described makes it clear how the\noperators can be physically interpreted in the limit of an\ninfinite volume continuum and, as we show below, enables the continuum quantum numbers of states to be\nidentified.\nAs noted above, in a finite volume there is some subtlety in the choice of the R in Eq. 4 (out of an infinite number of possibilities) which rotates (0, 0, |~\np|) (not\nnecessarily an allowed lattice momentum) to p~ (an allowed lattice momentum). In an infinite volume continuum the choice is not important as long as one convention is chosen because the two directions perpendicular to p~ are interchangeable; they are related by a rotation. However, on a finite lattice the two transverse\ndirections are not in general interchangeable; they are\nnot related by an allowed lattice rotation. Consider, for\n\n7\n\nNote that each subduction coefficient could be multiplied by an\narbitrary phase and it would still give a subduction from the\nhelicity to the little group irrep.\n\n\f6\nGroup |\u03bb|\u03b7\u0303 \u039b(\u03bc)\n+\n\nDic4\n0\n(n, 0, 0) 0\u2212\n1\n2\n2\n3\n4\n4\nDic2\n0+\n(n, n, 0) 0\u2212\n1\n1\n2\n2\n3\n3\n4\n4\nDic3\n0+\n(n, n, n) 0\u2212\n1\n2\n3\n3\n4\n\nA1 (1)\nA2 (1)\nE2 ( 12 )\nB1 (1)\nB2 (1)\nE2 ( 12 )\nA1 (1)\nA2 (1)\nA1 (1)\nA2 (1)\nB1 (1)\nB2 (1)\nA1 (1)\nA2 (1)\nB1 (1)\nB2 (1)\nA1 (1)\nA2 (1)\nA1 (1)\nA2 (1)\nE2 ( 12 )\nE2 ( 12 )\nA1 (1)\nA2 (1)\nE2 ( 12 )\n\n\u03b7\u0303,\u03bb\nS\u039b,\u03bc\n\n1\n1\n\u221a\n(\u03b4s,+ \u00b1 \u03b7\u0303\u03b4s,\u2212 )/ 2\n\u221a\n(\u03b4s,+ + \u03b7\u0303\u03b4s,\u2212 )/ 2\n\u221a\n(\u03b4s,+ \u2212 \u03b7\u0303\u03b4s,\u2212 )/ 2\n\u221a\n(\u00b1\u03b4s,+ + \u03b7\u0303\u03b4s,\u2212 )/ 2\n\u221a\n(\u03b4s,+ + \u03b7\u0303\u03b4s,\u2212 )/ 2\n\u221a\n(\u03b4s,+ \u2212 \u03b7\u0303\u03b4s,\u2212 )/ 2\n1\n1\n\u221a\n(\u03b4s,+ + \u03b7\u0303\u03b4s,\u2212 )/ 2\n\u221a\n(\u03b4s,+ \u2212 \u03b7\u0303\u03b4s,\u2212 )/ 2\n\u221a\n(\u03b4s,+ + \u03b7\u0303\u03b4s,\u2212 )/ 2\n\u221a\n(\u03b4s,+ \u2212 \u03b7\u0303\u03b4s,\u2212 )/ 2\n\u221a\n(\u03b4s,+ + \u03b7\u0303\u03b4s,\u2212 )/ 2\n\u221a\n(\u03b4s,+ \u2212 \u03b7\u0303\u03b4s,\u2212 )/ 2\n\u221a\n(\u03b4s,+ + \u03b7\u0303\u03b4s,\u2212 )/ 2\n\u221a\n(\u03b4s,+ \u2212 \u03b7\u0303\u03b4s,\u2212 )/ 2\n1\n1\n\u221a\n(\u03b4s,+ \u00b1 \u03b7\u0303\u03b4s,\u2212 )/ 2\n\u221a\n(\u00b1\u03b4s,+ \u2212 \u03b7\u0303\u03b4s,\u2212 )/ 2\n\u221a\n(\u03b4s,+ \u2212 \u03b7\u0303\u03b4s,\u2212 )/ 2\n\u221a\n(\u03b4s,+ + \u03b7\u0303\u03b4s,\u2212 )/ 2\n\u221a\n(\u03b4s,+ \u2213 \u03b7\u0303\u03b4s,\u2212 )/ 2\n\n\u03b7\u0303,\u03bb\nTABLE II. Subduction coefficients, S\u039b,\u03bc\n, for |\u03bb| \u2264 4 with\ns \u2261 sign(\u03bb); other notation is defined in the text.\n\nexample, the two (shortest) lattice vectors perpendicular\nto (0, 1, 1), namely (1, 0, 0) and (0, 1, \u22121) \u2013 these have\ndifferent lengths. Therefore, if the R's are not chosen\nappropriately there is the possibility of an inconsistency\nbetween correlators from different momentum directions\nwithin the same momentum type. For example, if R used\nfor (0, 1, 1) and R0 used for (1, 1, 0) are not related by a\nlattice rotation, this could lead to effectively different\ndefinitions of the little group irreps and different bases\nfor little group rows in (0, 1, 1) compared to (1, 1, 0); e.g.\nB1 (B2 ) from (0, 1, 1) could correspond to B2 (B1 ) from\n(1, 1, 0). This would prove problematic if averaging over\ndifferent momentum directions to increase statistics and\nwhen constructing multi-meson operators which contain\na sum over momentum directions with various weights.\nIf R and R0 are related by an allowed lattice rotation,\nthese inconsistencies do not arise because there is no allowed lattice rotation that rotates from direction (1, 0, 0)\nto direction (0, 1, \u22121), and so the different irreps or irrep\nrows cannot be mixed up.\nWe ensure consistency between different momentum\ndirections by breaking down R into two stages: R =\nRlat Rref . First, Rref , rotate from (0, 0, |~\np|) to p~ref , where\np~ref is a reference direction for momenta of type p~ (i.e. for\n\nthe star of p~). Note that Rref is not in general an allowed\nlattice rotation, but this is permissible because all we are\neffecting by this rotation is a basis transformation. For\nRlat we choose a lattice rotation which rotates from p~ref\nto p~. There are in general a finite number of possible\nchoices of lattice rotations for Rlat ; the particular choice\nis not important as long as we make the choice consistently for each momentum direction (for example when\nlater constructing multi-meson operators). More details\nof our implementation are given in Appendix C.\nTo illustrate this, consider momentum directions with\np2 = 2 and choose p~ref = (0, 1, 1). If we consider p~ =\n(0, 1, 1) then R = Rref is just a rotation from (0, 0, p) to\np~. On the other hand, if we consider p~ = (1, 1, 0) then\nR = Rlat Rref where Rref is that just described and Rlat\nis a lattice rotation that rotates (0, 1, 1) to (1, 1, 0).\nNow that we have described the construction of subduced helicity operators, in the next section we briefly\ndescribe some of the lattice and computational details,\nbefore explaining our method for determining the continuum spin of extracted states and giving some examples\nin the following section.\n\nIV.\n\nCOMPUTATIONAL DETAILS\n\nWe use anisotropic dynamical Clover lattices with lattice parameters described in detail in Refs. [5, 6], having\na spatial lattice spacing, as \u223c 0.12 fm, and a temporal lattice spacing approximately \u03be = as /at = 3.5 times\nsmaller, corresponding to a\u22121\nt \u223c 5.6 GeV. In Table III we\ngive details of the data sets used; in all cases we increase\nstatistics by averaging over equivalent momentum directions within a given momentum type. In the main body\nof results shown here, we use the Nf = 3 data set with\nlattice size L3s \u00d7 T = 163 \u00d7 128 in lattice units. This ensemble has three degenerate dynamical quark flavours,\ni.e. has SU(3) flavour symmetry, and corresponds to\nm\u03c0 = mK = m\u03b7 \u2248 700 MeV. Some comparisons are performed using the lattices of different volumes and quark\nmasses given in Table III. We consider isovector mesons\nand so only connected Wick contractions contribute.\nCorrelators are constructed using the distillation\nmethod [15] which, in combination with these anisotropic\nlattices, has proved fruitful in a number of applications\n[4, 14, 16\u201319]. For studying mesons in flight, an important aspect of distillation is that it allows a large basis\nof operators at the source and the sink, each projected\nonto a definite momentum.\nOur operator basis consists of all possible combinations of gamma matrices and zero, one or two latticediscretised gauge-covariant derivatives, coupled together\nand subduced into lattice little group irreps, to form subduced helicity operators as described above.

We use\nthe \u03a9 baryon mass to set the scale and quote all energies\nas ratios, E/m\u03a9 , where at m\u03a9 = 0.353(3) on the lattices\nwith m\u03c0 \u2248 700 MeV [6].\nAs a first test of the subduced helicity operator constructions, for each possible momentum with |~\np|2 = 1, 2,\n3 and 4, all possible correlators were computed, including\nthose off-diagonal in irrep and/or irrep row. This allowed\nthe orthogonality of correlators between different irreps,\nand between different rows in the same irrep, to be verified, along with the positivity of diagonal correlators and,\nwithin each irrep, the hermiticity of the correlator matrix\nand the consistency of different rows in the same irrep.\nIn addition, the consistency of correlators from different\nmomenta directions with the same momentum type was\nverified, something which would not necessarily be true\nif the rotation matrices, R, had not been chosen appropriately (see Section III).\n\nV.\n\nSPIN DETERMINATION\n\nFor mesons with non-zero momentum, the identification of the continuum spin of a state extracted in a lattice calculation is more complicated than for mesons at\nrest; even in an infinite volume continuum, an operator\nin general can have non-zero overlap with states of many\n\nGroup \u039bC (dim) Number of ops\nDic4\nA+\n14\n1 (1)\n(n, 0, 0) A+\n(1)\n20\n2\n+\nE2 (2)\n23\nB1+ (1)\n11\nB2+ (1)\n11\nA\u2212\n(1)\n18\n1\nA\u2212\n(1)\n12\n2\n\u2212\nE2 (2)\n29\nB1\u2212 (1)\n9\nB2\u2212 (1)\n9\nDic2\nA+\n(1)\n25\n1\n(n, n, 0) A+\n31\n2 (1)\nB1+ (1)\n23\nB2+ (1)\n23\nA\u2212\n(1)\n27\n1\nA\u2212\n(1)\n21\n2\n\u2212\nB1 (1)\n29\nB2\u2212 (1)\n29\nDic3\nA+\n(1)\n15\n1\n(n, n, n) A+\n(1)\n21\n2\nE2+ (2)\n33\n\u2212\nA1 (1)\n21\nA\u2212\n15\n2 (1)\nE2\u2212 (2)\n35\nTABLE V. The number of operators in our basis for each\nlittle group irrep \u039bC (C is the charge conjugation parity);\nalso shown is the dimension of each irrep.\n\nJ P , as discussed in Section II B. The reduced symmetry\ncompared to the zero momentum case means that more\nstates appear in each irrep leading to many degeneracies in the spectrum; some are dynamical degeneracies of\nphysical states in the true spectrum and others are caused\nby the reduced symmetry. Trying to identify the continuum quantum numbers by matching degenerate levels in\ndifferent little group irreps (after taking the continuum\n\n\f8\nlimit) will be even more problematic than for mesons at\nrest. It would appear difficult or impossible to disentangle the states shown in Figs. 8 to 11 without using some\nmore information beyond solely their energies.\nFor mesons stable against hadronic decay, a general\nidea as to where to expect different energy levels can be\nobtained from using the mass of the mesons at rest (extracted on the same lattice) and the dispersion relation,\n2\n\n(at E(|~\np|)) = (at m)2 +\n\n1\n\u03be2\n\n\u0012\n\n2\u03c0\nLs\n\n\u00132\n\n|~\np |2 .\n\n(9)\n\nTo determine a precise value for \u03be = as /at on this lattice, we use our measured \u03c0 energies, at E\u03c0 (|~\np|), at |~\np|2 =\n1, 2, 3, 4 and the \u03c0 mass from Ref. [14], and fit the dispersion relation8 to obtain a good fit with \u03be = 3.441(8).\nHowever, because of the degeneracies (within statistical\nuncertainties) in the spectrum, some further information is needed to determine the spin of extracted states.\nTherefore, following a similar procedure to that developed for mesons at rest in Refs. [4, 14], we consider the\nstate-operator overlaps.\nAfter subducing to lattice little group irreps, and neglecting the effects of a finite volume and finite lattice\nspacing, Eq. 5 becomes\n[J,P,|\u03bb|]\n\n0 O\u039b,\u03bc\n\n0\n\n(~\np) p~; J 0P , \u03bb0 = Z [J,J\n\n0\n\n,P,P 0 ,\u03bb]\n\n\u03b7\u0303,\u03bb\nS\u039b,\u03bc\n\u03b4\u03bb,\u03bb0 , (10)\n\nwhere \u03b7\u0303 \u2261 P (\u22121)J and J and P are respectively the\nspin and parity of the operator at rest. As discussed\nabove, even in an infinite volume continuum, at non-zero\nmomentum an operator can in general overlap onto states\nof many different spins and both parities. We use the\nconstraints on operator-state overlaps which arise from\nLorentz symmetry applied to our helicity operators to\ndetermine the continuum spin and parity of states. These\nconstraints can be read off from columns \"L1\", \"L2\" and\n\"L3\" of Tables XIII, XIV, XV and XVI in Appendix D.\nWe observe that mixings due to the reduced symmetry are small; a subduced operator from a helicity operator with helicity magnitude |\u03bb| only overlaps significantly\nonto states of helicity magnitude |\u03bb| and not with other\nhelicities in that irrep. In Fig. 1 we show the normalised\ncorrelation matrix on time-slice 5 for the A+\n2 irrep with\n|~\np|2 = 2 (including zero, one and two-derivative operators) ordered such that those subduced from \u03bb = 0 come\nbefore those from |\u03bb| = 2. The correlation matrix is observed to be approximately block diagonal, correlators\nmixing \u03bb = 0 and |\u03bb| = 2 are small.\nThis lack of mixing between different |\u03bb| is also seen in\nthe Z values. For example, consider the \u039bC = A+\n2 irrep.\nIn Fig. 2 we show the Z's for the lightest five states in\nthis irrep with |~\np|2 = 1, along with the J P C assignment\n\n8\n\nFitting to a more general form of the dispersion relation with p2\nand p4 terms gives a consistent result, \u03be = 3.441(13), and does\nnot improve the goodness of fit.\n\n0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0\np\nFIG. 1. Normalised correlation matrix (Cij / Cii Cjj ) on\n+\n2\ntime-slice 5 in the A2 irrep with |~\np| = 2 (Dic2 ). The first\n20 operators are subduced from \u03bb = 0 (top and left), the remaining 11 operators are subduced from |\u03bb| = 2 (bottom and\nright).\n\nfor each state; for simplicity of presentation, we use a\nsmaller operator basis, only including the seven zero and\none-derivative operators. The operator naming scheme\nis described in Section IV. Also shown on the right of the\nfigure is the spectrum of energy levels extracted in this\nirrep (the spin-identified spectrum is shown in the left\nhand panel of Fig. 8).\nThe same operators are shown for each state but the\ncolour coding varies according to the J P C hypothesis:\nred bars correspond to operators which overlap onto\nstates with that J P C at rest, blue bars correspond to operators which overlap with such states only at non-zero\nmomentum and hatched grey bars correspond to operators which do not overlap with such states (using the\nconstraints arising from Lorentz symmetry). As a concrete example, consider the first two operators shown,\nJ=0\n(\u03c0)J=0\n\u03bb=0 and (\u03c02 )\u03bb=0 . These contain, respectively, \u03b35 and\n\u03b30 \u03b35 in spin space, both with no derivatives, and at zero\nmomentum both overlap only with J P C = 0\u2212+ states.\nBoth contain no vector indices (i.e. no \u03b3 i or Di ) and so\nTable XIII is relevant but, as explained in Appendix D,\nbecause these operators overlap with J P = 0\u2212 at rest, we\nmust flip all the state parities in that table. The operator\n(\u03c0)J=0\n\u03bb=0 is of the form given in the \"L1\" column and from\nthere we see that, using Lorentz covariance constraints,\nit only overlaps onto J P = 0\u2212 . In the figures it is therefore coloured red for 0\u2212 states and grey for other J P . On\nthe other hand, (\u03c02 )J=0\n\u03bb=0 is of the form given in the \"L2\"\ncolumn and we see that at non-zero momentum it can\noverlap with both 0\u2212 and 1+ . It is therefore coloured\nred for 0\u2212 states, blue for 1+ states and grey for other\nJP .\nFor all the states shown, it can be seen that the red\n\n\f9\nbars are largest, although these overlaps can be small if\nthere is a mismatch in structure between the operator\nand the state. The blue bars can be significant, these\nshould be proportional to some power of |~\np|/M and so\nare suppressed compared to the red bars at low momentum, and the grey bars are small. From these figures it\ncan be seen that in each case the J P C can be determined\nunambiguously. For |~\np|2 = 1 (Dic4 ) the continuum helicities which subduce into the A2 irrep are 0, 4, . . . (Table\nII). The restricted operator basis used here does not contain helicities greater than two and so we can not test\nhelicity mixing here. In any case, the lightest spin-four\nstate is expected to be significantly higher in energy than\nthe heaviest states we extract in this analysis.\nIn Fig. 3 we show the Z's for the overlap of the lightest\nsix states in the A+\np|2 = 2 onto the ten zero\n2 irrep with |~\nand one-derivative operators in that irrep, along with\nthe spin assignment hypothesis for each state. Again, for\neach state, the continuum J P C can be unambiguously\ndetermined. For |~\np|2 = 2 (Dic2 ) the continuum helicities which subduce into the A2 irrep are 0, 2, 4, . . . (Table\nII) and the A+\n2 operator basis contains operators coming\nfrom \u03bb = 0 (the first seven operators) and |\u03bb| = 2 (the\nlast three operators). It can be seen that for each state\nonly \u03bb = 0 or |\u03bb| = 2 overlaps are statistically significantly non-zero, further supporting the observation at\nthe level of the correlation matrix, Fig. 1. Furthermore,\nthese overlaps are generally smaller than the overlaps\nonto operators with the correct continuum helicity but\nwhich are constrained to be zero by Lorentz symmetry.\nA second stage of the spin identification procedure is\nto compare the Z's for the overlap of a given state onto\na given continuum operator when this operator is subduced into two or more different little group irreps. From\nEq. 10, neglecting any finite volume or discretisation effects, these overlap factors should be equal, something\nthat is empirically found to be true for mesons at rest\nextracted on this lattice in Refs. [4, 14]. For mesons in\nflight the opportunities for such comparisons are more\nlimited. The only directly analogous situation is when\nthe same |\u03bb| subduces into two one-dimensional irreps\n(as opposed to subducing into one two-dimensional irrep); for example, \u03bb = \u00b12 with |~\np|2 = 1 subduces into\n2\nB1 and B2 , and \u03bb = \u00b11 with |~\np| = 2 subduces into B1\nand B2 . These comparisons can only be used to confirm\nthe continuum helicity rather than the continuum spin\n(although determining the continuum helicity does give\na minimum value of the continuum spin) and so such\ncomparisons are less useful for mesons in flight than for\nmesons at rest.\nAs an example, in Fig. 4 we show the Z's for the lowest two J P C = 2\u00b1+ states with |~\np|2 = 1 overlapping\nonto the three one-derivative operators subduced into the\n\u039bC = B1+ and B2+ irreps. The good agreement between\nZ values with the same operator subduced into different irreps is apparent. In Fig. 5 we show the Z's for\nthe lowest two J P C = 1\u00b1\u2212 states with |~\np|2 = 2 over-\n\nlapping onto the eight zero and one-derivative operators\nsubduced into the \u039bC = B1\u2212 and B2\u2212 irreps. Again, there\nis good agreement between the Z's in different irreps.\nThe consistency of these Z values for the same |\u03bb| subduced into different little group irreps relied on threerotation symmetry, assuming that the effects of a finite\nvolume and finite lattice spacing are small for these quantities. Using only constraints arising from three-rotation\nsymmetry, the Z's for different |\u03bb| components overlapping onto the same continuum operator are not related,\nbut some of these can be related using Lorentz symmetry constraints9 . These constraints can be read off from\nTables XIII, XIV, XV and XVI in Appendix D. Because\nthe constraints depend on which gamma matrices and\nhow many derivatives the operator was constructed out\nof, and how these were coupled together, comparisons\nare much more involved compared to those for mesons\nat rest. Therefore, in general we do not consider these\ncomparisons as part of our spin-identification procedure.\nAs an example, consider operators containing a \u03b3 i\nand zero derivatives, along with operators containing one\n\u2190\n\u2192\nderivative (Di ) and the identity in spin-space. Reading\noff from Table XIV (\"L1\" column), we see that the overE\nlap onto a J P = 1\u2212 state is iZ1 for \u03bb = \u00b11 and i M\nZ1 for\n\u03bb = 0. Note that if we only imposed 3-rotation covariance, the \u03bb = 0 overlap has two independent constants,\nZ1 and Z2 , and so cannot be related to the \u03bb = \u00b11 overlaps. In Fig. 6 we show the overlap factor for both these\noperators for the lowest 1\u2212\u2212 state with |~\np|2 = 1. There\nis good agreement between the different irreps for the \u03b3 i\n\u2190\n\u2192\noperator (1); for the Di operator (2) the Z values are\nsimilar but disagree significantly outside their statistical\nuncertainties. Sources for this discrepancy could be violations of hypercubic symmetry arising from the action\nor the result of mixing with multi-meson states which\nhave a different distribution across irreps compared to\nsingle-meson states. To check whether this discrepancy\ncould be a finite volume\neffect, in Fig. 6 we also plot the\np\nZ-values scaled by 163 /203 for the corresponding state\nextracted on a lattice with the same quark masses but a\nlarger volume, 203 in lattice units. Although the Z values\nfor operator (2) get slightly closer together on the larger\nvolume, there is no significant change in the pattern.\nIn summary, we have shown how operator overlaps can\nbe used to identify the continuum J P C of mesons with\nnon-zero momentum extracted in lattice calculations. In\nAppendix E we show some tests of the robustness of our\nextracted spectra and in the following section we apply\nthis method to identify continuum spin in our full extracted spectra.\n\n9\n\nif our operators were built out of Lorentz vectors we could relate\nall the helicities in every case, but our use of operators built from\n3-vectors limits where we can relate different |\u03bb|\n\n\f10\n0.973(4)\n\n1.075(10)\n\n1++\n\n1.336(12)\n0-+\n\n1.246(12)\n2-+\n\n0-+\n\n1.4\n\nE / m\u03a9\n\n0.5300(8)\n0-+\n\n1.2\n1.0\n0.8\n0.6\n\nFIG. 2.

Orange boxes with\na dotted outline indicate that the state's J P could not\nbe unambiguously determined in this analysis. The lines\nin the right hand column show expected energies (without statistical uncertainty) for the lower-lying states using masses from Ref. [14] and the dispersion relation,\nEq. 9, with \u03be = 3.441 (Section V). The triangles (circles) show the distribution of the components of these\nexpected states with definite J P =+ (J P =\u2212 ) across the\nirreps, using Table II.\nSpin assignment was initially carried out independently for each irrep and, as can be seen, the different\ncomponents of the same continuum state can be matched\nup between different irreps with good agreement between\nthe energies. The pattern of states across irreps (the\nboxes in the figure) is the same as the pattern expected\nfor states of definite continuum J P subduced across irreps (the triangles and circles in the figure). We note that\nit would be extremely challenging to identify the different\nstates with E/m\u03a9 \u223c 1.34 if we did not use information\nfrom the Z values.\nIn the A+\n1 irrep the state with E/m\u03a9 \u223c 0.90 (dark\ngrey, solid outline) is identified as having J P C = 0++ ,\nhas no partner in the other irreps and lies where the\na0 is expected.

It can be matched up with states identified as\n\n11\n\nfigures\nRecall that the \u03bb = 0 piece of a state with \u03b7\u0303 \u2261 P (\u22121)J = +1 or\n\u22121 subduces into the A1 or A2 irrep respectively, but the |\u03bb| > 0\npieces of a state subduce into the same irreps regardless of parity.\n\n2++ in the E2+ (\u03bb = \u00b11) and the B1+ and B2+ (\u03bb = \u00b12)\nirreps, and lies where the a2 is expected. The state at\n\u223c 1.29 (orange, dotted outline) is not well determined\nin this analysis. There are two states \u223c 1.34, one (dark\ngrey, solid outline) is identified as 0++ and appears to be\nthe a00 . The other (light red, dashed outline) is identified\nas the zero helicity piece of the exotic 1\u2212+ and can be\nmatched up with the 1\u2212+ in the E2+ irrep (\u03bb = \u00b11). This\nexotic state is extracted with the same precision as the\nnon-exotic states; its considerable overlap onto operators\nproportional to the commutator of two covariant derivatives, requiring a non-trivial gluonic field configuration,\nsuggests a hybrid interpretation [4, 22].\nMoving to the A+\n2 irrep, there are three states (light\ngrey, dashed outline) which have been identified as\nJ P C = 0\u2212+ at E/m\u03a9 \u223c 0.53, 1.08, 1.34; these do not\nhave partners in other irreps and lie where the pion and\nexcited pions are expected. The state at \u223c 0.97 (dark red,\nsolid outline) is identified as the zero helicity piece of 1++ ,\nmatches up with the 1++ in the E2+ irrep (\u03bb = \u00b11), and\nlies where the a1 is expected. Finally, the state \u223c 1.25\n(light green, dashed outline) is identified as the zero helicity piece of 2\u2212+ , can be matched up with the 2\u2212+ states\nin the E2+ (\u03bb = \u00b11) and the B1+ and B2+ (\u03bb = \u00b12) irreps,\nand lies where the \u03c02 is expected.\nThe full spectra with |~\np|2 = 1, 2, 3 and 4 are shown in\nFigs. 8, 9, 10 and 11 respectively, and the patterns can\nbe understood in a similar way. The expected distribution of the components of states with definite continuum\nJ P across the little group irreps can be determined from\nTable II and the extracted states are observed to match\nthis pattern.\nWe are able to extract states with exotic quantum\nnumbers, identified as hybrid mesons. In addition, the\nthird excited 1\u2212\u2212 state (\u03c1000 ), E/m\u03a9 \u223c 1.4 at |~\np|2 = 1,\nhas considerable overlap onto operators proportional to\nthe commutator of two covariant derivatives, requiring a\nnon-trivial gluonic field configuration. This suggests that\nwe identify this state as a non-exotic hybrid meson12 and\ncorresponds to the non-exotic hybrid identified at zero\nmomentum [4, 22].\nThe reduced symmetry of the Dic2 and Dic3 little\ngroups compared to Dic4 leads to even more degeneracies\nin the spectrum. For example, in the left hand panel of\nFig. 9 there are two degenerate states in A+\n1 irrep with\nE/m\u03a9 \u223c 1.07 identified as J P C = 2++ ; one is the \u03bb = 0\npiece and one is a \u03bb = \u00b12 piece, identified from their Z\nvalues. The other \u03bb = \u00b12 piece is in the A+\n2 irrep and the\n\u03bb = \u00b11 pieces are in the B1+ and B2+ irreps. A similar\nsituation arises in the A+\n2 irrep with two states \u223c 1.29\nidentified as 2\u2212+ , one corresponding to \u03bb = 0 and the\nother to \u03bb = \u00b12.\n\n12\n\nor a mixture of hybrid and conventional mesons with a significant\nhybrid component\n\n\fE / m\u03a9\n\n12\n\n1.2\n\n1.0\n\n0.8\n\n0.6\n\nFIG. 7. Spectrum of lowest-lying isovector mesons with positive charge conjugation parity in each irrep, \u039bC , for |~\np|2 = 1 (Dic4 ),\na subset of the spectrum shown in Fig. 8. The box height shows the one sigma statistical uncertainty above and below the\ncentral value; the colour coding, indicating the J P , is described in the text. As explained in the text, the lines in the right\nhand column show expected energies for the lower-lying states; the triangles (circles) show the distribution of the components\nof these positive (negative) parity states across the irreps.\n\nWe note that, around E/m\u03a9 \u223c 1.4 there start to be\nstates that we can not reliably extract or identify in some\n\u2212\nirreps. For example, in A+\np|2 = 1,\n2 and A2 irreps with |~\n++\n+\u2212\nwe are missing the \u03bb = 0 pieces of the 3\nand 3\nstates\nrespectively (Fig. 8). This could be because, although\nwe have an extensive operator basis, there is only one\noperator which overlaps with J = 3 at rest in each of\nthose two irreps. To reliably extract a spin-three state\nand increase the number of other states we can extract,\nwe would need to extend our operator basis to include\nthree-derivative operators.\nIn Fig. 12 we show the extracted energies as a function\nof |~\np|2 for some of the lower-lying states. Also shown are\nthe expected energies given by the dispersion relation,\nEq. 9, using \u03be = 3.441 and the rest mass extracted in\nRef. [4]. It can be seen that the extracted energies are in\nreasonably good agreement with the dispersion relation,\nhighlighting the observation that the extracted energies\nare in good agreement with the expected states in Figs. 8,\n9, 10 and 11, and indicating that with the dynamical\ntuning of parameters in the anisotropic lattice action,\nsymmetry between space and time has been restored to\ngood accuracy.\nIn summary, for all the |~\np|2 considered, we are able to\nPC\nof an extensive spectrum of extracted\nidentify the J\nstates across all irreps. The observed pattern of states\nacross irreps is the same as the pattern expected for the\ncomponents of states with definite continuum J P C distributed across irreps (Table II). The energies of the different helicity components can be matched up between\n\nirreps and generally agree well. However, the components in different irreps do not have to be degenerate in\na finite volume and a possible interpretation for this is in\nterms of mixing with multi-particle states, something we\ndiscuss in the following section.\n\nVII.\n\nMULTI-MESON STATES AND HELICITIES\n\nIn an infinite volume continuum with rotational symmetry in three dimensions, a state's two helicity components with the same |\u03bb|, +|\u03bb| and \u2212|\u03bb|, are constrained\nto have equal energy; they correspond to two rows of\nthe same two-dimensional irrep. However, components\nwith different magnitudes of helicity, |\u03bb|, of a state are\nnot constrained to have equal energy; they correspond to\ndifferent irreps. It is the additional constraints imposed\nby Lorentz symmetry, discussed in Section II B, which\nrequire that all the different helicity components have\nthe same energy; it is in this sense that they correspond\nto one state, a state at rest which has been boosted to\nnon-zero momentum.\nIn a finite volume, the reduced symmetry means that\nthere are even fewer constraints and, depending on the\nlittle group corresponding to the particular momentum\ntype, the two helicity components +|\u03bb| and \u2212|\u03bb| may\nbe split in energy. For example, with |~\np|2 = 1 (Dic4 ),\nthe two \u03bb = \u00b11 components both subduce into the twodimensional E2 irrep and so are constrained to have equal\nenergies. However, with |~\np|2 = 2 (Dic2 ), the two \u03bb = \u00b11\n\n\f13\n\nE / m\u03a9\n\n...\nFIG. 8.

Ellipses indicate that there are\nadditional states within a given irrep in that energy range but that they are not well determined in this calculation.

Squared energies as a function of |~\np|2 for a selection\nof the lower-lying states. The points (one for each irrep) are\nextracted energies; the lines are given by the dispersion relation, Eq. 9, using \u03be = 3.441 and the rest mass extracted in\nRef. [4] (not showing any statistical uncertainty).\n\ncomponents are split between the B1 and B2 irreps and\nso are not constrained to be degenerate.\nIn the spectra we have extracted, in general we see very\nlittle splitting of energies between the different irreps. As\nan example, in the left hand panel of Fig. 13 we show the\n\u2212\nlowest energies extracted in the A\u2212\n1 and E1 irreps with\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\u2212\n2\n|~\np| = 1, and in the A1 , B1 and B2 irreps with |~\np|2 = 2,\nalong with the expected energies for the \u03c1 (J P C = 1\u2212\u2212 )\nin flight from the dispersion relation. There is no statistically significant splitting between different |\u03bb| or between the B1\u2212 and B2\u2212 energy levels, and these energies\nlie where expected from the dispersion relation. We note\nthat the lowest energy \u03c0\u03c0 states with overall momenta\np~ = (0, 0, 1) and p~ = (0, 1, 1) are \u03c0(0, 0, 0)\u03c0(0, 0, 1) and\n\u03c0(0, 0, 0)\u03c0(0, 1, 1) respectively. In the absence of interactions, these would have energies E/m\u03a9 \u2248 0.95 and 1.04\nrespectively, significantly heavier than the corresponding\nground state energies we extract in the relevant irreps.\nThis suggests that any mixing with \u03c0\u03c0 states will be\nsmall. In fact, this is one reason for testing the helicity operator formalism on lattices with a relatively heavy\npion.\nFor comparison, in the right hand panel of Fig. 13\nwe show the corresponding energies extracted on 203\nand 243 \u00d7 128 lattices with lighter up and down quarks\n(Nf = 2 + 1), corresponding to m\u03c0 \u2248 400 MeV and having at m\u03a9 = 0.2951(22) [16] and \u03be = 3.433(5) (from a fit\nto the \u03c0 dispersion relations across all volumes)13 . Here\nwe observe more significant splittings between the ener\u2212\n\u2212\n\u2212\ngies in A\u2212\n1 compared to E2 or B1 ,B2 , and a smaller\nsplitting between B1 and B2 ; the pattern is the same on\n\nboth volumes. These splittings could arise from an imperfect restoration of Lorentz symmetry; however, comparison between the two lattices suggests an explanation\nin terms of mixing with multi-meson states in a finite\nvolume.\nOn the lattice with smaller m\u03c0 and volume 203 [243 ],\nthe lowest energy \u03c0\u03c0 state with overall momentum p~ =\n(0, 0, 1) is \u03c0(0, 0, 0)\u03c0(0, 0, 1) and in the absence of interactions this has energy E/m\u03a9 \u2248 0.63 [0.59]; the lowest \u03c0\u03c0 state with overall momentum p~ = (0, 1, 1) is\n\u03c0(0, 0, 0)\u03c0(0, 1, 1) at \u2248 0.73 [0.67] in the absence of interactions. The relative closeness of these \u03c0\u03c0 energy levels\nto the energies we extract suggests that the \u03c0\u03c0 admixture in will be larger here compared to the lattices with\nheavier pions.\nFor p~ = (0, 0, 1), in the absence of interactions the\n\u03c0(0, 0, 0)\u03c0(0, 0, 1) has lowest energy (E/m\u03a9 \u2248 0.63 or\n0.59 on the 203 or 243 respectively) and it subduces\nonly into the A1 irrep. The next lowest energy state\nis \u03c0(0, \u22121, 0)\u03c0(0, 1, 1) (\u2248 0.89 or 0.79) and this subduces\ninto both the A1 and E2 irreps14 . Therefore, the pattern\nof \u03c0\u03c0 energy levels in the A1 irrep is different from the\npattern in the E2 irrep and so the effect of multi-meson\nmixing in the \u03c1 will be different in the two irreps leading\nto a splitting of energies.\nA similar interpretation applies to p~ = (0, 1, 1): the\nstate \u03c0(0, 0, 0)\u03c0(0, 1, 1) has lowest energy (E/m\u03a9 \u2248 0.73\nor 0.67) in the absence of interactions and it subduces\nonly into the A1 irrep. The next lowest energy state is\n\u03c0(0, 1, 0)\u03c0(0, 0, 1) (\u2248 0.78 or 0.70), subducing into A1\nand B1 , and the next is \u03c0(0, 1, 0)\u03c0(1, 1, 1) (\u2248 0.98 or\n0.86), subducing into A1 and B2 . Therefore, we can again\nqualitatively explain the splitting of the energy levels in\nterms of mixing with multi-meson states.\nIn summary, multi-particle states have a different pattern of energy levels across irreps compared to a singleparticle state. The pattern of degeneracies seen in Figs. 8,\n9, 10 and 11 do not show any clear evidence for multiparticle states. However, there are suggestions that as we\nreduce the pion mass mixing with such states will become\nmore important.\nIn the full spectrum, we should observe additional\nstates, the orthogonal mixture of single and multi-meson\nbasis states. However, we do not expect to be able to\nproperly resolve multi-particle states with only fermion\nbilinear operators. As discussed in Ref. [4], if the operator basis is not sufficient, the variational method can not\nseparate the states and a conservative approach is to suggest that our mass values are only accurate up to the order of the hadronic width of the state. By supplementing\nour operator basis with two-meson operators (built from\nthe helicity operators described herein), we can extract\nthe full spectrum of single and two-meson states. We will\n\n14\n13\n\nFor the analyses on the lattices with m\u03c0 \u2248 400 MeV, the operator basis consisted of only zero and one-derivative operators.\n\nand also the B1 irrep; this will be expanded upon in future work,\nbut for the present discussion it suffices to observe that the pattern of subductions into A1 is different from E2 .\n\n\fE / m\u03a9\n\n16\n~ 0.95\n\n~ 1.04\n\n203\n\n243\n\n203\n\n243\n\nFIG. 13.

The left hand panel shows results from the 163 lattice with m\u03c0 \u2248 700 MeV and the right\nhand panel shows a comparison with results from the 203 and 243 lattices with m\u03c0 \u2248 400 MeV, along with the lowest \u03c0\u03c0\nenergy level in the absence of interactions (described in the text).\n\nthen be able to extract phase shifts and, if appropriate,\nresonance parameters using the method of L\u00fcscher[1],\ngeneralised to an overall non-zero momentum[7], utilised\nexplicitly in [8]; this will be the subject of future work.\n\nVIII.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nWe have shown how to construct fermion-bilinear operators for mesons in flight which are subduced from\noperators of definite helicity and respect the reduced\nsymmetry of a cubic lattice in a finite cubic volume.\nWe have demonstrated the effectiveness of these operator constructions by using them to extract an extensive\nspectrum of isovectors mesons with various momenta.\nWe find that the spectrum can be described in terms of\nsingle-meson states of determined J P C and have reliably\nidentified the quantum numbers of the extracted states,\nincluding states with exotic quantum numbers, states of\nhigh spin and excited states.\nIn order to study resonances and scattering in lattice\nQCD, it is necessary to extract a complete finite-volume\nmeson spectrum, and to do this we must supplement\nour bases of operators resembling single-hadron states\nwith operators resembling pairs of mesons projected onto\ndefinite relative momentum. Such operators, interpolating the meson-meson pair MA MB , will be of the form\nOMA (~\np)OMB (~\np 0 ), where OMA (~\np) efficiently interpolates\nmeson MA with momentum p~. Using large bases of operators of the form described herein, we can variationally\ndiagonalise the matrix of correlators and hence obtain the\noptimal operator for MA with momentum p~ (and similarly for MB ). The subsequent reduction of the contribution of excited MA? mesons to the MA MB correlators will\nmean that the relevant energy levels can be extracted at\nearlier Euclidean times where statistical noise is smaller,\nleading to more precise determinations of signals for scattering.\nWith the extracted spectrum at light pion masses\n\nviewed in the finest detail, we observe effects that may be\ncompatible with the admixture of meson-meson states.\nIn future calculations, meson-meson operators will be\nconstructed from products of the in-flight operators derived herein, allowing us to resolve this admixture precisely and so to extract information on meson-meson\nscattering and any possible resonance [1, 7, 8].\nAs well as their application to constructing multimeson operators, these in-flight interpolators play a significant role in calculations of matrix elements at finite\nmomentum, such as those used to measure form factors. The inclusion of meson operators with non-zero momentum in such analyses gives further kinematic points,\nenabling the form factor to be calculated at more Q2\npoints and so the Q2 dependence to be mapped out more\nfully[2, 3]. Again, having an optimal operator to interpolate a meson will reduce the contribution of excited\nmesons, meaning that quantities can be extracted at earlier Euclidean times where statistical noise is smaller.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nWe thank our colleagues within the Hadron Spectrum Collaboration, in particular Mike Peardon and\nDavid Richards for useful discussions.

Parts\nof Chung [9] and Chapter 3 of Martin and Spearman [26]\nare also relevant.\n\u02c6\n\u02c6\n\u02c6\nThe operator R\u0302\u03c6,\u03b8,\u03c8 = e\u2212i\u03c6Jz e\u2212i\u03b8Jy e\u2212i\u03c8Jz rotates\naround the z-axis by \u03c8, then around the y-axis by \u03b8 and\nfinally around the z-axis by \u03c6 (with a fixed coordinate\nsystem). As a shorthand we will denote the (active) rotation which rotates from the z-axis to the direction of p~\n[which is (p, \u03b8, \u03c6) in spherical coordinates] by R\u03020 . There\nare many possible choices for R\u03020 and these lead to different phases in the definition of helicity states. Jacob\nand Wick choose R\u0302\u03c6,\u03b8,\u03c6 and Chung chooses R\u0302\u03c6,\u03b8,0 , but\nthe choice is not important for the present discussion as\nlong as one convention is used consistently.\nDenoting a boost along the z-axis with magnitude p\nby L\u0302z (p), a helicity state is defined by\n|~\np; J, \u03bbi \u2261 R\u03020 L\u0302z (p) |J, \u03bbi ,\n\n(A1)\n\nwhere |J, \u03bbi is a state at rest with spin J and Jz component \u03bb. From the definition, it is simple to show\nthat under some arbitrary rotation, R\u0302, these helicity\nstates transform as15\np; J, \u03bb ,\nR\u0302 p~; J, \u03bb = R\u0302~\nand the helicity is invariant.\nIn contrast, a canonical state (using the terminology\nof Chung), where the spin component is measured along\nthe z-axis, is defined by\n|~\np; J, mi \u2261 R\u03020 L\u0302z (p)R\u03020\u22121 |J, mi\n= L\u0302(~\np) |J, mi ,\n\n(A2)\n\nwhere L\u0302(~\np) = R\u03020 L\u0302z (p)R\u03020\u22121 is a Lorentz boost along direction p\u0302 with magnitude p. These states transform under\nrotations as\nX (J)\nR\u0302 p~; J, m =\nDm0 m (R) R\u0302~\np; J, m0 ,\nm0\n(J)\n\nwhere Dm0 m (R) is a Wigner-D matrix, i.e. these states\ntransform under rotations in the same way as |J, mi.\nUsing the definitions in Eqs. A1 and A2, it is straightforward to show that helicity and canonical states are\nrelated by\nX (J)\n|~\np; J, \u03bbi =\nDm\u03bb (R\u03020 ) |~\np; J, mi .\n(A3)\nm\n\n15\n\nNote that there may be some phase introduced here if the rotation has some component around the p\n~ direction.\n\n\f18\nWe have shown previously[4] that, in the continuum,\nwhen p~ = 0 the OJ,M constructed in Section II A overlap\nwith only one spin:\n\nIf instead we consider a reflection in the xz plane\n(y \u2192 \u2212y), \u03a0\u0302xz , then the discussion proceeds in a similar\nway [10],\n\np = ~0) p~ = ~0; J 0 , m0 = Z [J] \u03b4J,J 0 \u03b4m,m0 , (A4)\n0 OJ,m (~\nand so we can write\n\n\u02c6\n\n\u03a0\u0302xz = e\u2212i\u03c0Jy P\u0302 .\nWe have\n\u02c6\n\n~0; J, m = [OJ,m (~0)]\u2020 0 .\n\n(A5)\n\ne\u2212i\u03c0Jy J P , \u03bb =\n\nX\n\n(J)\n\nD\u03bb0 \u03bb (0, \u03c0, 0) J P , \u03bb0\n\n,\n\n\u03bb0\n\nIn particular, the operator, [OJ,m (~0)]\u2020 , transforms in a\nsimilar way to the state. We can therefore carry over the\ndiscussion of canonical and helicity states and define a\nboosted canonical operator,\n[O\n\nJ,m\n\n\u2020\n\n(~\np)] = L\u0302(~\np)[O\n\nJ,m\n\n\u2020\n\n(~0)] L\u0302\n\n\u22121\n\n(~\np) .\n\n(A6)\n\nA helicity operator is then given by\nX (J)\n[OJ,\u03bb (~\np)]\u2020 =\nDm\u03bb (R) [OJ,m (~\np)]\u2020 ,\n\n(A7)\n\nm\n\nand transforms in the same way as a helicity state. Taking the complex conjugate we obtain\nX (J)\u2217\nOJ,\u03bb (~\np) =\nDm\u03bb (R) OJ,m (~\np) ,\n(A8)\nm\n\nwhich is Eq. 4 in Section II A.\n\n1.\n\n= (\u22121)J\u2212\u03bb J P , \u2212\u03bb ,\nand this leads to\n\u03a0\u0302xz p~z ; J P , \u03bb = P (\u22121)J\u2212\u03bb p~z ; J P , \u2212\u03bb .\n\n(A10)\n\nThis has the same form as Eq. A9 but with a different\nphase. If we consider an arbitrary p~ and an arbitrary\nreflection in a plane containing p~, the result will be of\nthe same form as Eqs. A9 and A10 but in general there\nwill be some \u03bb-dependent phase.\nIt can be seen that for \u03bb = 0 the helicity states are\neigenstates of \u03a0\u0302 with eigenvalue \u03b7\u0303 \u2261 P (\u22121)J . Furthermore, because \u03bb = 0 there is no additional phase depending on the choice of reflection plane. The \u03b7\u0303 'parity' is a\ngood quantum number of the zero-helicity components at\nfinite momentum and determines which little group irrep\n\u03bb = 0 subduces into (Table II). In addition, because \u03b7\u0303\nis related to the transformation of helicity states with\n\u03bb > 0 under reflections, \u03b7\u0303 also appears in the subduction\ncoefficients for \u03bb > 0.\n\nParity and reflections\n\nHelicity states at non-zero momentum are not eigenstates of parity because a parity transformation, P\u0302 , reverses the direction of the momentum, p~ \u2192 \u2212~\np. A reflection in a plane containing the momentum direction, \u03a0\u0302\n(a parity transformation followed by a rotation to bring\nthe momentum direction back to the original direction),\npreserves p~. However, helicity states are also in general\nnot eigenstates of \u03a0\u0302 because under such a transformation\n\u03bb \u2192 \u2212\u03bb.\nAs an example, consider a helicity state with spin J,\nrest parity P and momentum, p~z , directed along the zaxis, p~z ; J P , \u03bb ; the state at rest is denoted by J P , \u03bb .\nIf \u03a0\u0302yz is a reflection in the yz plane (x \u2192 \u2212x) and P\u0302 is\na parity transformation (x, y, z \u2192 \u2212x, \u2212y, \u2212z) then\n\u02c6\n\n\u02c6\n\n\u02c6\n\n\u03a0\u0302yz = e\u2212i\u03c0Jx P\u0302 = e\u2212i\u03c0Jy e\u2212i\u03c0Jz P\u0302 .\nIn analogy to the discussion in Ref.

B5 and B6 and the standard representation for p~ = p~z ,\n\u03b5i (p~z , m = 0) = (0, 0, E/M ) ,\n1\n\u03b5i (p~z , m = \u00b11) = \u2213 \u221a (1, \u00b1i, 0) ,\n2\n\n(B7)\n\nwhere M and E are, respectively, the mass and energy\nof the state.\nPolarisation tensors for states of higher spin can be\nconstructed in the usual way from direct products of the\nspin-one polarisation vectors with the helicities coupled\ntogether using standard SU (2) Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.\n\nAppendix C: Lattice rotation and little group\nconventions\n\nIn Table VI we give the specific rotations that we\nuse for Rref (Section III) which rotate from (0, 0, |~\np|) to\np~ref . We use the same convention as in Appendix A,\n\u02c6\n\u02c6\n\u02c6\nnamely that a rotation R\u03c6,\u03b8,\u03c8 = e\u2212i\u03c6Jz e\u2212i\u03b8Jy e\u2212i\u03c8Jz rotates around the z-axis by \u03c8, then around the y-axis by\n\u03b8 and finally around the z-axis by \u03c6 (with a fixed coordinate system).\nIn Tables VII, VIII and IX we give a choice of representation matrices for, respectively, the little groups\nDic4 , Dic2 and Dic3 . For Dic2 and Dic3 , the rotations\nand reflections refer to a coordinate system which has\nbeen transformed using Rref , so that p~ defines the new zaxis. These representations are used with the group theoretic projection formula (for example, see Appendix A\nof Ref. [4]) to calculate the subduction coefficients given\nin Table II.\n\nAppendix D: Tables of general parameterisations\n\nHere we give general parameterisations for the infinite\nvolume continuum overlaps of states with fermion bilinear operators using constraints of Lorentz or 3-rotation\nsymmetry. Tables X, XI and XII give parameterisations\nfor operators with zero, one and two vector indices respectively. The columns labelled \"Lorentz\" give Lorentz\ncovariant parameterisations for the overlaps, i.e. using Lorentz covariance constraints applied to our operators built from 3-vectors. These are derived from the\nLorentz covariant parameterisations given in Appendix\nA of Ref. [11] by setting the Lorentz indices to specific\nvalues. The columns labelled \"3-Rotation\" give the general 3-rotation covariant parameterisations.\nIn Tables XIII-XVI we give the overlap of states onto\nthe operators OJ,\u03bb defined in Eq. 4. These overlaps follow\nfrom Tables X, XI and XII once the vector indices are\ntransformed to a circular basis and then coupled together\n\nto give a definite spin as described in Section II A. We\nonly show overlaps where the helicity of the operator is\nequal to that of the state; the other overlaps are zero.\nThe tables give overlaps for an operator of one parity,\ndetermined from the parity of the state with which it\noverlaps at zero momentum. To use the tables for operators of the opposite parity, all the state parities must be\nflipped; we give examples of this below. The inclusion of\na \u03b35 matrix in the operator does not change the allowed\noverlaps, except that the parity of the states may flip as\ndiscussed below.\nNote that the parameterisations are written in terms\nof helicity polarisation tensors, discussed in Appendix\nB, not polarisation tensors defined in terms of the zcomponent of spin. Repeated indices are summed over.\nAlthough these are all fermion bilinear operators, for\nbrevity we omit the \u03c8\u0304 and \u03c8 in the tables.\nAs an example, consider the operator \u03c8\u0304\u03b3 0 \u03c8 which at\nzero momentum overlaps only onto the J P C = 0+\u2212 state.\nThe Lorentz covariant parameterisations are [11]\np) = Zp\u03bc ,\n0 \u03c8\u0304\u03b3 \u03bc \u03c8 0+\u2212 (~\nand\np, \u03bb) = Z\u03b5\u03bc (~\np, \u03bb) .\n0 \u03c8\u0304\u03b3 \u03bc \u03c8 1\u2212\u2212 (~\nSetting \u03bc = 0 these give\np) = Zp0 ,\n0 \u03c8\u0304\u03b3 \u03bc=0 \u03c8 0+\u2212 (~\nand\n0 \u03c8\u0304\u03b3 \u03bc=0 \u03c8 1\u2212\u2212 (~\np, \u03bb) = Z\u03b50 (~\np, \u03bb) = Z\u03b5i (~\np, \u03bb)pi /E,\nwhere E = p0 is the energy of the state and in the last\nline we have used p\u03bc \u03b5\u03bc (~\np, \u03bb) = 0. These two parameterisations are given in the \"L2\" column of Table X where we\nhave absorbed factors of E into the arbitrary constants.\nAs another example, consider the operator \u03c8\u0304\u03b3 5 \u03b3 0 \u03c8.\nThis is the same as the operator considered previously\napart from the additional \u03b3 5 , and at zero momentum it\noverlaps only onto the J P C = 0\u2212+ state. In order to use\nTable X we must flip the parities of all the states and so\nthe parameterisations become\n0 \u03c8\u0304\u03b3 5 \u03b3 \u03bc \u03c8 0\u2212+ (~\np) = Zp0 ,\nand\n0 \u03c8\u0304\u03b3 5 \u03b3 \u03bc \u03c8 1++ (~\np, \u03bb) = Z\u03b50 (~\np, \u03bb) = Z\u03b5i (~\np, \u03bb)pi /E.\n\nAppendix E: Robustness of the extracted spectrum\n\nTo check the robustness of our results to changing the\noperator basis, as well as using the full bases containing up to two-derivative operators, we also performed\nsome analyses using only zero and one-derivative operators. Fig. 14 shows the extracted energy levels in the A+\n2\n\n\fE / m\u03a9\n\n20\n\nFIG. 14. Comparison of the lower-lying states extracted using zero and one-derivative operators, and with that basis\nsupplemented with two-derivative operators, for the A+\n2 irrep\nwith |~\np|2 = 1 (Dic4 ) (left panel) and |~\np|2 = 2 (Dic2 ) (right\npanel). The box height shows the one sigma statistical uncertainty above and below the central value; the colour coding,\nindicating the J P , is described in the text.\n\nirrep for |~\np|2 = 1 and |~\np|2 = 2. All use 200 configurations,\n3 time-sources and the correlators are averaged over 6\nmomentum directions, except for the one-derivative basis\nwith |~\np|2 = 2 which is averaged over 12 momentum directions. The one-derivative basis for this irrep contains 7\n(10) operators with |~\np|2 = 1 (|~\np|2 = 2), whereas the twoderivative basis contains 20 (31) operators. The colour\ncoding indicates the identified J P : black/grey for J = 0,\nred for J = 1 and green for J = 2; darker shades with\na solid outline correspond to positive parity and lighter\nshades with a dashed outline correspond to negative parity. Orange boxes with a dotted outline indicate that the\nstate's J P could not be unambiguously identified.\nIncluding two-derivative operators significantly increases the size of the operator basis, reduces the statistical uncertainty on the higher extracted levels, and\nincreases the number of states and the highest spin which\ncan be reliably extracted (the latter point is not visible in\nthese figures). However, for the lower states there is no\nstatistically significant change in the extracted energies\nand no significant increase in precision of the energies\nextracted, verifying the robustness of the energies we extract under a reduction in size of the operator basis.\n\n\f21\nLittle Group p\n~ref\n\u03c6\n\u03b8\n\u03c8\nDic4\n(0, 0, n) 0\n0\n0\nDic2\n(0, n, n) \u03c0/2\n\u03c0/4\n\u2212\u03c0/2\n\u221a\nDic3\n(n, n, n) \u03c0/4 cos\u22121 (1/ 3) 0\nTABLE VI.
