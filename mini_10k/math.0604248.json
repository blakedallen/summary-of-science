This is one of very few known general results concerning\ncombinatorics of compact hyperbolic Coxeter polytopes. We also obtain\na similar result for simple non-compact polytopes.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction.\n\nA Coxeter polytope in the spherical, hyperbolic or Euclidean space is a polytope whose dihedral angles are all integer submultiples of \u03c0. These polytopes\nare very important among acute-angled polytopes since a group generated\nby reflections with respect to the facets of a Coxeter polytope is discrete. On\nthe other hand, a fundamental chamber of any (finitely generated) discrete\nreflection group in these spaces is a Coxeter polytope.\nAlready in 1934, H. S. M. Coxeter [4] proved that any spherical Coxeter\npolytope (containing no pair of opposite points of the sphere) is a simplex\nand any compact Euclidean Coxeter polytope is either a simplex or a direct\nproduct of simplices.\nHowever, hyperbolic Coxeter polytopes are still far from being classified.\nIt was proved by E. Vinberg [14] that no compact hyperbolic Coxeter polytope exists in dimensions d \u2265 30; M. Prokhorov [11] and A. Khovanskij [9]\n1\n\nPartially supported by grant of President of Russia NS-5666.2006.1\nPartially supported by grants of President of Russia MK-6290.2006.1 and NS5666.2006.1\n2\n\n1\n\n\fproved that no hyperbolic Coxeter polytope of finite volume exists in dimensions d \u2265 996. These bounds do not look sharp: the examples are known\nonly up to dimension 8 in compact case and up to dimension 21 in the noncompact case.\nBesides the restriction on the dimension and some series of examples,\nthere exists a classification of hyperbolic Coxeter polytopes of certain combinatorial types. More precisely, compact simplices were classified by F. Lann\u00e9r [10], and non-compact simplices were classified by several authors (see\ne.g. [3] or [13]). Simplicial prisms were listed by I. Kaplinskaja [8]; F. Esselmann [5] obtained the classification of the remaining compact hyperbolic\nCoxeter d-dimensional polytopes with d + 2 facets. These consist of seven\n4-dimensional polytopes with mutually intersecting facets (we call these polytopes Esselmann polytopes and reproduce the list in Fig. 1). P. Tumarkin [12]\nclassified those non-compact hyperbolic Coxeter d-dimensional polytopes with\nd + 2 facets that do not have disjoint facets. The only simple polytope from\nthis list is shown in Figure 2 and is of dimension 4.\nThis paper is devoted to the proof of the following theorem:\nTheorem A. Let P be a compact hyperbolic Coxeter d-dimensional polytope.\nIf d > 4 then P has a pair of disjoint facets.\nIf d \u2264 4 and P has no pair of disjoint facets then P is either a simplex\nor one of the seven Esselmann polytopes.\nA d-dimensional polytope is simple if any vertex of P is contained in exactly\nd facets, or equivalently, facets of P at each vertex are in general position.\nThe classification of spherical polytopes implies that any compact hyperbolic\nCoxeter polytope is simple. While proving Theorem A, we slightly change the\nproof to obtain a similar result concerning simple non-compact hyperbolic\nCoxeter polytopes of finite volume.\nTheorem B. Let P be a simple non-compact hyperbolic Coxeter d-dimensional polytope of finite volume. If d > 9 then P has a pair of disjoint facets.\nIf d \u2264 9 and P has no pair of disjoint facets then P is either a simplex\nor the 4-dimensional polytope shown in Fig. 2.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we recall some information\nabout Coxeter polytopes. In Section 3 we introduce some technical tools\n\n2\n\n\fwe use for proving the theorems. Section 4 is devoted to the proof of the\ntheorems.\nWe prove both theorems A and B simultaneously. The proof is by induction on the dimension d. The most general case is d \u2265 9. In this case the\nproof is by examination of the combinatorics of the Coxeter diagram \u03a3(P )\nwhile making use of a recent result of D. Allcock (Theorem 2). Some minor\ntechnical refinements generalize the proof to d \u2265 7 (see Section 4.5).\nThe small dimensions are considered in Sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.3 and 4.4. In\ndimensions d = 2 and 3 the argument is purely combinatorial (Lemma 7).\nIn dimensions from 4 to 6 the proof also uses a computational technique\ndeveloped in Section 3 based on the notion of local determinants.\n10\n\n10\n\nPSfrag replacements\n8\n\n8\n\n8\n\nFigure 1: Coxeter diagrams of Esselmann polytopes (or Esselmann diagrams\nfor short).\n\nFigure 2: Coxeter diagram of the unique simple non-compact Coxeter dpolytope that has d + 2 facets and has no pair of disjoint facets.\nThe authors would like to thank the referee for many helpful comments\nand suggestions. We are grateful to D. Panov for pointing out to us the result\nof D. Allcock, and to D. Allcock who introduced us to his paper [1], which\nwas not published yet.\n\n3\n\n\f2\n\nPreliminaries.\n\nIn this section we list the essential facts about Coxeter diagrams and Gale\ndiagrams. Concerning Coxeter diagrams we follow mainly [15] and [16]. For\ndetails about Gale diagrams see [7]. At the end of the section we recall results\nof R. Borcherds [2] and D. Allcock [1] concerning Coxeter faces of Coxeter\npolytopes.\nIn what follows we write d-polytope instead of \"d-dimensional polytope\",\nk-face instead of \"k-dimensional face\" and facet instead of \"face of codimension one\".\n\n2.1\n\nCoxeter diagrams.\n\n1. An abstract Coxeter diagram \u03a3 is a finite 1-dimensional simplicial complex\nwith weighted edges, where weights wij are positive, and if wij < 1 then\nwij = cos \u03c0k for some integer k \u2265 3. A subdiagram of \u03a3 is a subcomplex with\nthe same weights as in \u03a3. The order |\u03a3| is the number of vertices of the\ndiagram \u03a3.\nIf \u03a31 and \u03a32 are subdiagrams of an abstract Coxeter diagram \u03a3, we\ndenote by h\u03a31 , \u03a32 i a subdiagram of \u03a3 spanned by the vertices of \u03a31 and \u03a32 .\nGiven an abstract Coxeter diagram \u03a3 with vertices v1 , . . . , vn and weights\nwij , we construct a symmetric n \u00d7 n matrix M(\u03a3) = (cij ), where cii = 1,\ncij = \u2212wij if vi and vj are adjacent, and cij = 0 otherwise. By determinant,\nrank and signature of \u03a3 we mean the determinant, the rank and the signature\nof M(\u03a3).\nWe can suppress the weights but indicate the same information by labelling the edges of a Coxeter diagram in the following way: if the weight wij\n\u03c0\nequals cos m\n, vi and vj are joined by an (m \u2212 2)-fold edge or a simple edge\nlabelled by m; if wij = 1, vi and vj are joined by a bold edge; if wij > 1, vi\nand vj are joined by a dotted edge labelled by wij (or without any label).\n\u03c0\n, and [vi , vj ] = \u221e if wij \u2265 1.\nWe write [vi , vj ] = m if wij equals cos m\n\u03c0\nBy a multiple edge we mean an edge of weight cos m\nfor m \u2265 4. By a\n\u03c0\nmulti-multiple edge we mean an edge of weight cos m for m \u2265 6.\nAn abstract Coxeter diagram \u03a3 is elliptic if M(\u03a3) is positive definite. An\nn \u00d7 n matrix is called indecomposable if it cannot be transformed to a blockdiagonal one by simultaneous permutations of columns and rows. Clearly,\nconnected components of \u03a3 correspond to indecomposable components of\n4\n\n\fM(\u03a3). A diagram \u03a3 is parabolic if any indecomposable component of M(\u03a3)\nis degenerate and positive semidefinite; a connected diagram \u03a3 is a Lann\u00e9r\ndiagram if \u03a3 is indefinite but any proper subdiagram of \u03a3 is elliptic; a connected diagram \u03a3 is a quasi-Lann\u00e9r diagram if \u03a3 is not a Lann\u00e9r diagram, \u03a3\nis indefinite, but any proper subdiagram of \u03a3 is either elliptic or parabolic;\n\u03a3 is superhyperbolic if its negative inertia index is greater than 1.\nThe list of connected elliptic and parabolic diagrams with their standard\nnotation is contained in [16, Tables 1,2]. See also [16, Tables 3,4] for the lists\nof Lann\u00e9r and quasi-Lann\u00e9r diagrams. We need the following properties of\nthese lists:\n\u2022 there are finitely many Lann\u00e9r diagrams of order greater than 3, and\nthe maximal order of a Lann\u00e9r diagram is 5;\n\u2022 any Lann\u00e9r diagram of order 5 contains a subdiagram of the type H4\nor F4 ;\n\u2022 any Lann\u00e9r diagram of order 4 contains a subdiagram of the type H3\nor B3 ;\n\u2022 any Lann\u00e9r diagram of order 3 contains a multiple edge;\n\u2022 Lann\u00e9r diagrams of order greater than 3 contain no multi-multiple\nedges;\n\u2022 any quasi-Lann\u00e9r diagram of order n contains a connected parabolic\nsubdiagram of order n \u2212 1.\n2. It is convenient to describe Coxeter polytopes by their Coxeter diagrams.\nLet P be a Coxeter polytope with facets f1 , . . . , fr . The Coxeter diagram\n\u03a3(P ) of the polytope P is a diagram with vertices v1 , . . . , vr ; two edges vi\nand vj are not joined if the hyperplanes spanned by fi and fj are orthogonal;\nvi and vj are joined by an edge with weight\n\uf8f1\n\u03c0\n\uf8f4\nif fi and fj form a dihedral angle \u03c0k ;\n\uf8f2cos k ,\nwij = 1,\nif fi is parallel to fj ;\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\ncosh \u03c1, if fi and fj diverge and \u03c1 is the distance from fi to fj .\n5\n\n\fIf \u03a3 = \u03a3(P ), then M(\u03a3) coincides with the Gram matrix of outer unit\nnormals to the facets of P (referring to the standard model of hyperbolic\nd-space in Rd,1 ).\nIt is shown in [15] that a Coxeter diagram \u03a3(P ) of a compact d-dimensional hyperbolic polytope P is a connected diagram of signature (d, 1) without\nparabolic subdiagrams. In particular, \u03a3(P ) contains no bold edge, and any\nindefinite subdiagram contains a Lann\u00e9r diagram. Moreover, it is shown there\nthat any compact hyperbolic Coxeter d-polytope P is simple, and elliptic\nsubdiagrams of \u03a3(P ) are in one-to-one correspondence with faces of P : a\nk-face F corresponds to an elliptic subdiagram of order d \u2212 k whose vertices\ncorrespond to the facets of P containing F .\nIt is also shown in [15] that if \u03a3(P ) is a Coxeter diagram of a non-compact\nhyperbolic d-polytope P , then for any ideal vertex V of P (i.e. V lies at\nthe boundary of the hyperbolic space) the vertices of \u03a3(P ) corresponding\nto facets containing V compose a parabolic diagram of rank d \u2212 1, and any\nparabolic subdiagram of \u03a3(P ) may be enlarged to some parabolic subdiagram\nof rank d \u2212 1. In particular, if P is simple then any parabolic subdiagram\nS of \u03a3(P ) is connected and has rank d \u2212 1, i.e. S has order d. Clearly,\nany indefinite subdiagram of \u03a3(P ) contains either a Lann\u00e9r or quasi-Lann\u00e9r\ndiagram.\nAs an easy corollary, we have the following statement.\nProposition 2.1.1. Let P be a simple hyperbolic Coxeter d-polytope. Then\n\u03a3(P ) contains either a Lann\u00e9r or quasi-Lann\u00e9r diagram, and \u03a3(P ) does not\ncontain parabolic diagrams of order less than d.\nLemma 1. Let \u03a3(P ) be a Coxeter diagram of a hyperbolic Coxeter d-polytope\nP of finite volume. Then no proper subdiagram of \u03a3(P ) is a diagram of a\nhyperbolic Coxeter d-polytope of finite volume.\nProof. Suppose that a proper subdiagram \u03a3 \u2282 \u03a3(P ) is a diagram of a Coxeter d-polytope of finite volume. The vertices of \u03a3 determine a polytope P \u2032 .\nDenote by GP and GP \u2032 the groups generated by reflections with respect to\nthe facets of P and P \u2032 respectively. The group GP \u2032 is a subgroup of GP .\nSince P \u2032 is of finite volume, GP \u2032 has a finite index in GP . At the same time,\nthe number of facets of P is more than P \u2032 has. This contradicts the main\nresult of [6] which claims that if P and P \u2032 are finite volume Coxeter polytopes\nin Hn or En , GP and GP \u2032 are the groups generated by reflections in the facets\n\n6\n\n\fof P and P \u2032 respectively, and GP \u2032 \u2286 GP is a finite index subgroup, then the\nnumber of facets of P does not exceed the number of facets of P \u2032.\nCorollary 1. If a Coxeter diagram of a simple Coxeter polytope P contains\na quasi-Lann\u00e9r subdiagram then P is a simplex.\nProof. Any quasi-Lann\u00e9r diagram of order d + 1 is a Coxeter diagram of\nnon-compact hyperbolic Coxeter d-dimensional simplex of finite volume (see\ne.g. [15]). Suppose that P is not a simplex. Lemma 1 implies that if P is a dpolytope of finite volume then \u03a3(P ) contains no quasi-Lann\u00e9r subdiagrams of\norder d + 1. Clearly, \u03a3(P ) does not contain any quasi-Lann\u00e9r subdiagram of\norder greater than d + 1. Further, since P is simple, any connected parabolic\nsubdiagram of \u03a3(P ) should have order d, so \u03a3(P ) contains no quasi-Lann\u00e9r\nsubdiagram of order less than d + 1, either.\n\n2.2\n\nGale diagrams and missing faces.\n\nWe do not use the content of this section throughout the paper except for\nthe proof of the Theorems A and B for 4-polytopes.\nEvery combinatorial type of simple d-polytope with d + k facets can be\nrepresented by its Gale diagram G. This consists of d + k points a1 , . . . , ad+k\non (k \u2212 2)-dimensional unit sphere Sk\u22122 \u2282 Rk\u22121 centered at the origin. Each\npoint ai corresponds to a facet fi of P . The combinatorial type of a convex\npolytope can be read off from the Gale diagram in the following way: for any\nJ \u2282 {1, . . . , d + k} the intersection of facets {fj | j \u2208 J} is a proper (that is,\nnon-empty) face of P if and only if the origin is contained in the interior of\nconv {aj | j \u2208\n/ J} (where conv X is a convex hull of the set X).\nThe points a1 , . . . , ad+k \u2208 Sk\u22122 compose a Gale diagram of some ddimensional polytope P with d + k facets if and only if every open half-space\nH + in Rk\u22121 bounded by a hyperplane H through the origin contains at least\ntwo of the points a1 , . . . , ad+k .\nNotice that the definition of Gale diagram introduced above concerns\nsimple polytopes only, and it is \"dual\" to the standard one (see, for example, [7]): usually Gale diagram is defined in terms of vertices of polytope\ninstead of facets. Notice also that the definition above takes simplices out\n7\n\n\fof consideration: usually one means the origin of R1 with multiplicity d + 1\nby the Gale diagram of a d-simplex, however we exclude the origin since we\nconsider simple polytopes only, and the origin is not contained in G for any\nsimple polytope except the simplex.\nLet P be a simple polytope. The facets f1 , . . . , fm of P compose a missing\nm\nT\nfi = \u2205 but any proper subset of {f1 , . . . , fm } has a non-empty\nface of P if\ni=1\n\nintersection.\n\nLemma 2. Let P be a simple d-polytope with d + k facets {fi }, let G =\n{ai } \u2282 Sk\u22122 be a Gale diagram of P , and let I \u2286 {1, . . . , d + k}. Then the\nset MI = {fi | i \u2208 I} is a missing face of P if and only if the following two\nconditions hold:\ncI =\n(1) there exists a hyperplane H through the origin separating the set M\n{ai | i \u2208 I} from the rest points of G;\n(2) for any proper subset J \u2282 I no hyperplane through the origin separates\ncJ = {ai | i \u2208 J} from the remaining points of G.\nthe set M\n\nProof. Suppose first that both conditions hold. Since P is simple, (1) implies\ncI ) does not contain the origin, so T fi = \u2205. If T fi is also\nthat conv (G \\ M\ni\u2208I\n\ni\u2208J\n\ncJ ) does not contain the\nempty for some J ( I, we obtain that conv (G \\ M\ncJ\norigin, so there exists a hyperplane H through the origin such that G \\ M\n+\n\u2212\n+\n\u2212\nis contained in one of halfspaces H and H , say H . Then G \u2229 H is a\ncJ , i.e. some subset of M\ncJ is separated by a hyperplane through\nsubset of M\nthe origin, which contradicts (2).\nNow suppose that MI is a missing face. Then there exists a hyperplane H\ncI is contained in a halfspace H + . Since P\nthrough the origin such that G \\ M\nis simple, we may assume that G \u2229 H = \u2205. To prove (1) suppose the contrary,\ncI\\i is also contained in H + , that\ni.e. ai0 \u2208 H + T\nfor some i0 \u2208 I. Then G \\ M\n0\nmeans that\nfi is empty in contradiction to the definition of missing face.\ni\u2208I\\i0\n\nc\nTo prove\nT (2) notice that if some hyperplane HJ separates MJ for some J ( I\nthen\nfi = \u2205, which also contradicts the definition of missing face.\ni\u2208J\n\n8\n\n\fSuppose that P is a simple hyperbolic Coxeter polytope. The definition\nof missing face implies that for any Lann\u00e9r or quasi-Lann\u00e9r subdiagram L \u2282\n\u03a3(P ) the facets corresponding to L compose a missing face of P (and any\nmissing face of P corresponds to some Lann\u00e9r or quasi-Lann\u00e9r diagram in\n\u03a3(P )).\n\n2.3\n\nFaces of Coxeter polytopes.\n\nLet P be a hyperbolic Coxeter d-polytope, and denote by \u03a3(P ) its Coxeter\ndiagram. Let S0 be an elliptic subdiagram of \u03a3(P ). By [15, Th. 3.1], S0\ncorresponds to a face of P of dimension d \u2212 |S0 |. Denote this face by P (S0 ).\nP (S0 ) itself is an acute-angled polytope, but it might not be a Coxeter polytope. R. Borcherds proved the following sufficient condition for P (S0 ) to be\na Coxeter polytope.\nTheorem 1 ([2], Ex. 5.6). Suppose P is a Coxeter polytope with diagram\n\u03a3(P ), and S0 \u2282 \u03a3(P ) is an elliptic subdiagram that has no An or D5 component. Then P (S0 ) itself is a Coxeter polytope.\nFacets of P (S0 ) correspond to those vertices that together with S0 comprise an elliptic or positive semidefinite subdiagram of \u03a3(P ). The following\nresult of D. Allcock shows how to compute dihedral angles of P (S0 ).\nLet a and b be the facets of P (S0 ) coming from facets A and B of P , i.e.\na = A \u2229 P (S0 ) and b = B \u2229 P (S0). Denote by vA and vB the nodes of \u03a3(P )\ncorresponding to the facets A and B. We say that a node of \u03a3(P ) attaches\nto S0 if it is joined with some nodes of S0 by edges of any type. Then the\nangles of P (S0 ) can be computed in the following way.\nTheorem 2 ([1], Th. 2.2). Under the hypotheses of Theorem 1,\n(1) If neither vA nor vB attaches to S0 , then \u2220ab = \u2220AB.\n(2) If just one of vA and vB attaches to S0 , say to the component S0i , then\n(a) if A \u22a5 B then a \u22a5 b;\n(b) if vA and vB are joined by a simple edge, and adjoining vA and vB\nto S0i yields a diagram Bk (resp. Dk , E8 or H4 ) then \u2220ab = \u03c0/4\n(resp. \u03c0/4, \u03c0/6 or \u03c0/10);\n(c) otherwise, a and b do not meet.\n9\n\n\f(3) If vA and vB attach to different components of S0 , then\n(a) if A \u22a5 B then a \u22a5 b;\n(b) otherwise, a and b do not meet.\n(4) If vA and vB attach to the same component of S0 , say S0i , then\n(a) if A and B are not joined and S0i \u222a {A, B} is a diagram E6 (resp.\nE8 or F4 ) then \u2220ab = \u03c0/3 (resp. \u03c0/4 or \u03c0/4);\n(b) otherwise, a and b do not meet.\nLet w \u2208 \u03a3(P ) be a neighbor of S0 , so that w attaches to S0 by some edges.\nWe call w a good neighbor if hS0 , wi is either an elliptic diagram or a positive\nsemidefinite diagram, and bad otherwise. We denote by S 0 the subdiagram\nof \u03a3(P ) consisting of vertices corresponding to facets of P (S0 ). The diagram\nS 0 is spanned by good neighbors of S0 and by all vertices not joined to S0 (in\nother words, S 0 is spanned by all vertices of \u03a3(P ) \\ S0 except bad neighbors\nof S0 ). If P (S0 ) is a Coxeter polytope, denote its Coxeter diagram by \u03a3S0 .\nCorollary 2. Suppose that P (S0 ) is a Coxeter polytope.\n(a) If S0 has no good neighbors then S 0 = \u03a3S0 . In particular, this always\n(m)\nholds for S0 = H4 and G2 where m \u2265 7, for S0 = H4 if d > 4, and\n(6)\nfor S0 = G2 if d > 3.\n(b) If S0 = Bn , n \u2265 2, and \u03a3S0 contains a subdiagram S of the type H4 or\nF4 , then S is contained in S 0 , too.\nProof. To prove (a) one should only notice that all neighbors of diagrams\n(6)\nlisted in item (a) (except for F4 and G2 ) are bad. Any good neighbor of F4\n(6)\nor G2 leads to a parabolic subdiagram of \u03a3(P ) of order 4 and 3 respectively,\nwhich contradicts Prop. 2.1.1 in case of d > 4 and d > 3.\nItem (b) follows immediately from Theorem 2.\nNotice also that any face of a simple polytope is a simple polytope itself.\nIn particular, if P is simple then for any elliptic subdiagram S \u2282 \u03a3 the\npolytope P (S) is also simple.\n\n10\n\n\f3\n\nTechnical tools.\n\n3.1\n\nLocal determinants.\n\nLet \u03a3 be a Coxeter diagram, and let T be a subdiagram of \u03a3 such that\ndet(\u03a3 \\ T ) 6= 0.

We construct the required diagram in several steps.\n1. Analyzing the data. Since S0 has no good neighbors, S 0 = \u03a3S0 (see\nCor. 2). Denote by dim = d \u2212 |S0 | the dimension of P (S0 ). As a subdiagram of \u03a3(P ), the diagram \u03a3S0 contains no dotted edges. Clearly,\ndim < d. By the assumption, Theorems A and B hold for polytopes\nof dimension less than d. By Prop 2.1.1, P (S0 ) is either a compact\nsimplex (and 2 \u2264 dim \u2264 4) or one of the Esselmann polytopes (and\ndim = 4).\n2. Choosing S1 . We take a subdiagram S1 \u2282 S 0 = \u03a3S0 as follows:\nIf dim = 4 then S 0 contains a subdiagram S1 of type F4 or H4 .\nIf dim = 3 then S 0 contains a subdiagram S1 of type B3 or H3 .\n(k)\n\nIf dim = 2 then S 0 contains a subdiagram of type G2 , k \u2265 4, i.e.\n(k)\na multiple edge. We choose S1 as a diagram G2 \u2282 S 0 , where k is\nmaximal in S 0 .\nClearly, in all cases conditions (1) and (2) are satisfied. Notice also,\nthat if S 0 contains a multi-multiple edge, then the diagram S1 has no\ngood neighbors in \u03a3(P ).\n3. Choosing y0 . If P (S0 ) is a simplex, then S1 contains all but one vertex\nof S 0 . Let y0 = S 0 \\ S1 .\nIf P (S0) is an Esselmann polytope, then it is always possible to choose\ny0 \u2208 S 0 \\ S1 such that the diagram hy0 , S1 i coincides with one of the\nfour diagrams shown in Fig. 5 (for y0 we take the vertex marked by y).\nThus, condition (3) holds.\n\n13\n\n\fPSfrag replacements\n8\ny\n\ny\n\ny\n\ny\n\nFigure 5: subdiagrams of Esselmann diagrams.\n\n4. Choosing y1 . We consider two cases.\n(\u03b1) Suppose that S1 has no good neighbors in \u03a3(P ). Then S 1 = \u03a3S1\nand P (S1) is either a compact simplex or an Esselmann polytope.\nClearly, S0 \u2282 S 1 . If P (S1) is a simplex, define y1 = S 1 \\ S0 .\nIf P (S1 ) is an Esselmann polytope, we define y1 \u2208 S 1 such that\nhS0 , y1 i is one of the four diagrams shown in Fig. 5 (for y1 we take\nthe vertex marked by y). Hence, hS0 , y1i satisfies condition (4\u03b1).\n(\u03b2) Suppose that S1 has a good neighbor in \u03a3(P ). We choose y1 as\none of good neighbors of S1 . The vertex y1 is connected to S1 by\nexactly one edge, and this edge is simple. The vertex y1 might\nalso be connected to any vertex of S0 and to y0 .\nSince S1 has a good neighbor and |S1 | \u2264 d \u2212 2, Cor. 2 implies that\n(k)\nS1 6= F4 , H4 , G2 for k \u2265 6 (in particular, S1 contains no multimultiple edge). Therefore, S 0 is neither an Esselmann diagram\nnor a Lann\u00e9r diagram of order 5, so S 0 is a Lann\u00e9r diagram of\norder 3 or 4. In the latter case S 0 contains no multi-multiple\nedge. In the first case, recall that the diagram S1 is chosen as\na subdiagram of S 0 containing the edge of maximal multiplicity.\nSince S1 contains no multi-multiple edges, S 0 = hy0 , S1 i does not\ncontain them, either. Thus, condition (4\u03b2) holds.\nCondition (5) is satisfied by assumption (iii) of the lemma, and condition (6)\nis satisfied by the choice of S1 , which completes the proof.\nLemma 4. The number of diagrams hS0 , y1 , y0, S1 i of signature (d, 1), 4 \u2264\nd \u2264 8, satisfying conditions (1) \u2212 (6) of Lemma 3, is finite.\n(k)\n\nProof. Suppose that S0 6= G2 for k \u2265 6. Then by condition (3) the diagram\nhS0 , y1 , y0, S1 i contains no multi-multiple edges. Since |S0 | + |S1 | = d \u2264 8,\n14\n\n\fwe obtain that |hS0 , y1 , y0 , S1 i| \u2264 10, and we have finitely many possibilities\nfor the diagram.\n(k)\nNow suppose that S0 = G2 , k \u2265 6. Since |hS0 , y1, y0 , S1 i| = d + 2 and\nsign hS0 , y1 , y0, S1 i = (d, 1), we have dethS0 , y1, y0 , S1 i = 0. We consider two\ncases: either the diagram S1 has a good neighbor in hS0 , y1 , y0 , S1 i or not.\nCase (\u03b1): S1 has no good neighbors in hS0 , y1, y0 , S1 i. In this case the subdiagrams hS0 , y1 i and hS1 , y0 i are either Lann\u00e9r diagrams or diagrams shown\nin Fig. 5. The only edge connecting these diagrams is y0 y1 ; we let m = [y0 , y1 ]\n(see Fig. 4). By Prop. 3.1.2, we have\ndet(hS0 , y1 , y0, S1 i, hy1 , y0i) = det(hS0 , y1i, y1 ) * det(hy0 , S1 i, y0 ) \u2212 cos2\n\n\u03c0\n.\nm\n\nSince dethS0 , y1 , y0 , S1 i = 0, we obtain\ndet(hS0 , y1i, y1 ) * det(hy0 , S1 i, y0) = cos2\n\n\u03c0\n.\nm\n\nIn particular,\n| det(hS0 , y1 i, y1) * det(hy0 , S1 i, y0 )| < 1\n(m = 2 is impossible, since the two indefinite subdiagrams hS0 , y1 i and\nhy0 , S1 i should be joined in \u03a3(P )). Hence, at least one of | det(hS0 , y1 i, y1)|\nand | det(hy0 , S1 i, y0)| is less than 1.\n(k)\nSuppose that | det(hS0 , y1i, y1 )| < 1. Recall that S0 = G2 , k \u2265 6,\nand we have det(hS0 , y1 i, y1 ) = D (i, j, k), where i, j \u2264 k by assumption.\nSince |D (i, j, k)| is an increasing function on i, j, k, it is easy to see that if\nk \u2265 6, k \u2265 i, j and |D (i, j, k)| < 1, then (i, j, k) is either (2, 3, 7) or (2, 3, 8).\nSo, hS0 , y1 i is either L2,3,7 or L2,3,8 , and k \u2264 8. Therefore, the diagram\n(l)\nhS0 , y1 , y0, S1 i contains no subdiagram G2 for l > 8 and we are left with\nfinitely many diagrams.\nSuppose that | det(hy0 , S1 i, y0)| < 1. Since the diagram hy0 , S1 i is either\na Lann\u00e9r diagram or one of the diagrams shown in Fig. 5, it is easy to check\nthat if |S1 | > 2 then det(hy0, S1 i, y0) > 1. Therefore, |S1 | = 2, d = 4. Again,\nit is easy to see that there are only 5 triples (i, j, k) for which i, j \u2264 k and\n|D (i, j, k)| < 1: (i, j, k) = (2, 3, 7), (2, 4, 5), (2, 3, 8), (3, 3, 4) and (2, 5, 5).\nFor each of these triples there exist finitely many triples (i\u2032 , j \u2032 , k \u2032 ) satisfying\nthe condition |D (i\u2032 , j \u2032 , k \u2032 ) * D (i, j, k)| < 1. So, in the case when S1 has no\ngood neighbors in hS0 , y1, y0 , S1 i the lemma is proved.\n15\n\n\fCase (\u03b2): y1 is a good neighbor of S1 in hS0 , y1 , y0 , S1 i. Note that any edge\nof hS0 , y1 , y0, S1 i belongs to either hS0 , y1 i or hy1 , y0, S1 i. By Lemma 3.1.1,\nwe have\ndet(hS0 , y1 , y0, S1 i, y1) = det(hS0 , y1i, y1 ) + det(hy1 , y0 , S1 i, y1) \u2212 1.\nOn the other hand,\ndet(hS0 , y1 , y0, S1 i, y1) =\n\ndet(hS0 , y1, y0 , S1 i)\n= 0.\ndet(hS0 , y0 , S1 i)\n\nTherefore,\ndet(hS0 , y1i, y1 ) + det(hy1 , y0 , S1 i, y1) = 1.\nSince hy0 , S1 i and hy1, y0 , S1 i are indefinite diagrams, we obtain that\ndet(hy1 , y0 , S1 i, y1) > 0, so det(hS0 , y1 i, y1 ) < 0. Furthermore, |hy1 , y0 , S1 i| =\nd, which implies\n| dethy1 , y0 , S1 i| < d!\n(\u2217)\n(since the absolute value of each of the summands in the standard expansion\nof the determinant does not exceed 1). At the same time, by condition (4\u03b2)\nthe diagram hy0 , S1 i contains no multi-multiple edges, and we have finitely\nmany possibilities for dethy0 , S1 i. Therefore, there exists a positive constant\nM such that\nM < | dethy0 , S1 i|.\n(\u2217\u2217)\nCombining (\u2217) and (\u2217\u2217), we obtain\n0 < det(hy1 , y0 , S1 i, y1) <\nhence,\n1\u2212\n\nd!\n,\nM\n\nd!\n< det(hS0 , y1 i, y1) < 0.\nM\n\n(k)\n\n(\u2217\u2217\u2217)\n(l)\n\nRecall that S0 = G2 and that the diagram hS0 , y1 i contains no G2 for\nl > k. In particular, det(hS0 , y1 i, y1 ) = D (i, j, k) for some i, j \u2264 k. By (\u2217\u2217\u2217),\nwe have finitely many possibilities for k. By the assumption, hS0 , y1 , y0 , S1 i\n(l)\ncontains no subdiagram of the type G2 for l > k, so we have finitely many\npossibilities for the whole diagram hS0 , y1 , y0 , S1 i.\n\n16\n\n\f(k)\n\nAccording to Lemma 4, for each S0 = G2 , B3 , B4 , H3 , H4, F4 we can write\ndown the complete list\nL(S0 , d)\nof diagrams hS0 , y1 , y0, S1 i of signature (d, 1), 4 \u2264 d \u2264 8, satisfying conditions\n(1) \u2212 (6) of Lemma 3 and containing no parabolic diagrams of order less than\nd. Define also a list\nL(d) =\n\n\u221e\nS\n\nk=6\n\n(k)\n\nL(G2 , d).\n\nBy Lemma 4, the list L(d) is also finite. In view of condition (4) of Lemma 3,\nthe list L(S0 , d) naturally splits into two disjoint parts\nL(S0 , d) = L\u03b1 (S0 , d) \u222a L\u03b2 (S0 , d),\nwhere the list L\u03b1 (S0 , d) consists of diagrams satisfying condition (4\u03b1), and\nthe list L\u03b2 (S0 , d) consists of diagrams satisfying condition (4\u03b2). Similarly,\nthe list L(d) splits into two parts\nL\u03b1 (d) =\n\n\u221e\nS\n\nk=6\n\n(k)\n\nL\u03b1 (G2 , d) and L\u03b2 (d) =\n\n\u221e\nS\n\nk=6\n\n(k)\n\nL\u03b2 (G2 , d).\n\nThese lists were obtained by a computer. Usually they are not very short.\nIn what follows we reproduce some parts of the lists as far as we need.\nRemark. It is easy to see that the bounds obtained in the proof of Lemma 4\nare not optimal. In real computations we usually analyze concrete data to\nreduce calculations.\nThe following lemma is obvious:\nLemma 5. For any diagram \u03a3 and any constant C the number of diagrams\n(k)\nh\u03a3, xi (spanned by \u03a3 and a single vertex x) containing no subdiagrams G2\nfor k > C is finite.\nHence, for any diagram \u03a3, a constant C and dimension d, it is possible\nto write down a complete list\nL\u2032 (\u03a3, C, d)\n\n17\n\n\f(k)\n\nof diagrams h\u03a3, xi of signature (d, 1) containing no subdiagrams G2 for\nk > C.\nGiven \u03a3, C and d, the list L\u2032 (\u03a3, C, d) can be obtained by a computer. We\nreproduce some of these lists as far as we need. To shorten the computations\nwe use the following:\n1) Suppose that h\u03a3, xi \u2208 L\u2032 (\u03a3, C, d), and |\u03a3| \u2265 d + 1. Then |h\u03a3, xi| \u2265\nd + 2, and deth\u03a3, xi = 0. To check the determinant is faster than to find the\nsignature. So, first we compute the determinant and in the rare cases when\nit vanishes we compute the signature.\n2) Suppose that \u03a3 \u2282 \u03a3(P ), where P is a simple hyperbolic d-polytope\nwithout a pair of disjoint facets. Suppose that \u03a3 contains a connected elliptic\nsubdiagram S 6= Ak , D5 . Suppose also that S 6\u2282 \u03a3 (since |S| + |S| > d, this\nalways holds if |\u03a3| \u2264 d + |B|, where B is the set of bad neighbors of S in\n\u03a3). In this case there exists x \u2208 \u03a3(P ) \\ \u03a3 which is either a good neighbor\nof S or is not joined to S. Denote by L\u2032 (\u03a3, C, d, S (g,n)), L\u2032 (\u03a3, C, d, S (g)) and\nL\u2032 (\u03a3, C, d, S (n) ) the sublists of L\u2032 (\u03a3, C, d) which consist of diagrams h\u03a3, xi\nsatisfying the following conditions (g, n), (g) and (n) respectively:\n(g, n) either x is a good neighbor of S or x is not a neighbor of S;\n(g) x is a good neighbor of S;\n(n) x is not a neighbor of x.\nNow we may assume (in the assumptions above) that \u03a3(P ) contains a diagram h\u03a3, xi from one of the lists L\u2032 (\u03a3, C, d, S (g,n)), L\u2032 (\u03a3, C, d, S (g) ) and\nL\u2032 (\u03a3, C, d, S (n) ). This hugely reduces the computations.\n\n4\n\nProof of Theorems A and B.\n\nThe plan of the proof is as follows. We assume that there exists a simple\nhyperbolic Coxeter d-polytope P with mutually intersecting facets, and P\nis not a simplex. Then, using Theorem 1, Corollary 1 and the classification of Lann\u00e9r diagrams, we find a Coxeter face of P of sufficiently small\ncodimension. In view of Theorem 2, this face often has no pair of disjoint\nfacets either. This enables us to carry out an induction in large dimensions\n(d \u2265 7). In small dimensions (up to 6) the existence of simplices and Esselmann polytopes forces us to involve also a computer case-by-case check\nbased on computations of local determinants.\n18\n\n\fFor a part of the proof (in dimensions 4 \u2212 6) we also need the following\nlemma.\nLemma 6. Let P be a simple Coxeter hyperbolic d-polytope without a pair\nof disjoint facets. If P is neither a simplex nor an Esselmann polytope nor\nthe polytope shown in Fig. 2, then P has at least d + 3 facets.\nProof. The lemma follows immediately from the classification of hyperbolic\nCoxeter d-polytopes with d + 1 and d + 2 facets. The polytopes with d + 1\nfacets are simplices, compact polytopes with d+2 facets are either Esselmann\npolytopes or simplicial prisms, and the latter have disjoint facets; any simple\nnon-compact polytope with d + 2 facets is either a simplicial prism or the\npolytope shown in Fig. 2.\n\n4.1\n\nDimensions 2 and 3.\n\nThe following lemma does not involve hyperbolic geometry.\nLemma 7. Let P be a simple d-polytope and d = 2 or 3. If P has no pair\nof disjoint facets then P is a simplex.\nProof. For d = 2 the statement is evident.\nTo prove it for d = 3 note that any simple 3-polytope different from\nsimplex has at least one 2-face which is not a triangle. Denote such a face by\nf . Let a and b be non-adjacent edges of f . Denote by fa and fb the faces of P\nsuch that a = fa \u2229 f and b = fb \u2229 f . By assumption of the lemma fa \u2229 fb 6= \u2205.\nSince P is simple, fa \u2229 fb is an edge. Therefore, the set \u2202P \\ {f \u2229 fa \u2229 fb }\nhas two connected components M1 and M2 (here \u2202P is the boundary of P ).\nEach of these components Mi contains at least one face mi of P , hence m1\nand m2 are two disjoint facets of P .\n\n4.2\n\nDimension 4.\n\nLemma 7 does not hold for 4-polytopes. Moreover, for any k \u2265 6 there\nexists a simple 4-polytope with k facets having no pair of disjoint facets.\nMore precisely, the duals of the cyclic polytopes C(k, 4) are simple, have k\nfacets, and any two of its facets intersect in a 2-face (i.e. these polytopes\n19\n\n\fare 2-neighborly); see [7] for definitions and details. Furthermore, there\nare already known seven Esselmann compact Coxeter hyperbolic 4-polytopes\nwith 6 facets containing no pair of disjoint facets (see Fig. 1), and one noncompact 4-polytope which is combinatorially equivalent to a product of two\nsimplices (see Fig. 2).\nProposition 4.2.1. Let P be a simple hyperbolic Coxeter 4-polytope having\nno pair of disjoint facets. If P is not an Esselmann polytope then \u03a3(P )\ncontains no multi-multiple edge.\nPSfrag replacements\n(k)\nProof. Suppose that \u03a3(P ) contains a multi-multiple edge. Choose S0 = G2 ,\nk \u2265 6, as an edge of maximal multiplicity in \u03a3(P ). Clearly, S0 has no good\nneighbors, so by Lemma 3, \u03a3(P ) contains a subdiagram hS0 , y1 , y0, S1 i from\nthe list L(4).\n10\n6\n(a)\n\n8\n\n6\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\nFigure 6: Intermediate results for d = 4.\nThe list L\u03b1 (4) contains two Esselmann diagrams only. The list L\u03b2 (4)\ncontains two Esselmann diagrams and the diagrams shown in Fig. 6(a), 6(b),\nand 6(c). By Lemma 1, \u03a3(P ) contains no Esselmann diagrams. Hence, we\nare left with three diagrams shown in Fig. 6(a), 6(b), and 6(c). In these cases\n(l)\n\u03a3(P ) contains no subdiagrams G2 for l > 6, 6, and 8 respectively. Since\nnone of these diagrams is a diagram of a 4-dimensional Coxeter polytope (see\nLemma 6), \u03a3(P ) should contain some diagram from the list L\u2032 (\u03a3, C, 4), where\n\u03a3 ranges over the diagrams from Fig. 6(a), 6(b), and 6(c), and C = 6, 6, and\n8 respectively. However, these lists are empty: a straightforward computer\ncheck shows that taking any diagram h\u03a3, xi, where x attaches to \u03a3 by edges\nof multiplicity at most C \u2212 2, we obtain either a superhyperbolic diagram or\na diagram with positive inertia index \u2265 5 (in fact, we compute the signature\nonly for those diagrams whose determinant vanishes, see the remark below\nthe definition of the list L\u2032 (\u03a3, C, d)). Thus, we come to a contradiction with\nthe assumption of the proposition.\n\n20\n\n\fTo prove the main result of this section, i.e. Lemma 9, we need the\nfollowing lemma:\nLemma 8. Let P be a simple hyperbolic Coxeter 4-polytope having no pair\nof disjoint facets. Suppose that P is not a simplex.\n(a) Let v1 , . . . , v6 be any six vertices of \u03a3(P ). Then the subdiagram\nspanned by v1 , . . . , v6 contains two disjoint Lann\u00e9r diagrams of order 3 each.\n(b) The order of any Lann\u00e9r subdiagram of \u03a3(P ) equals 3.\nRemark. The lemma involves combinatorics only. For any simple polytope\nP we may consider a \"diagram of missing faces\" instead of Coxeter diagram\nand missing faces instead of Lann\u00e9r diagrams.\nProof. Consider a Gale diagram G of the 4-polytope P . Denote by f1 , . . . , fn\nthe facets of P . Then G is a set of n points at (n \u2212 6)-dimensional sphere\nSn\u22126 . Denote by b1 , . . . , bn the points corresponding to the facets f1 , . . . , fn\nrespectively. Since P is simple, we may assume that bi 6= bj for i 6= j. Denote\nby vi the vertex of \u03a3(P ) corresponding to a facet fi , i = 1, . . . , n. Consider\nan (n \u2212 6)-dimensional plane \u03a0 spanned by b7 , . . . , bn and the origin. Again,\nwe may assume that \u03a0 does not contain points bi for i \u2264 6. The hyperplane\n\u03a0 separates Sn\u22126 into two hemispheres. Since P has no disjoint facets, each\nof the hemispheres contains at least 3 points from {b1 , . . . , b6 } (see Lemma 2).\nHence, three points (say b1 , b2 , b3 ) belong to one halfspace, the rest belong\nto another, which means that hv1 , v2 , v3 i and hv4 , v5 , v6 i are Lann\u00e9r diagrams\n(again, see Lemma 2), and (a) is proved.\nTo prove (b) suppose that hvk , vk+1 , vk+2 , vk+3i is a Lann\u00e9r diagram. Consider the corresponding points bk , bk+1 , bk+2 , bk+3 in the Gale diagram. By\nLemma 2, there exists an (n \u2212 6)-plane \u03a0 through the origin separating these\nfour points. We can rotate the hyperplane \u03a0 around the origin until it meets\none of the points b1 , . . . , bn . It cannot meet first any of bk , bk+1 , bk+2 , bk+3\n(if \u03a0 passes through one of these points then the other three are separated by a plane, so the four points do not correspond to a Lann\u00e9r diagram). Hence, \u03a0 will meet first some point x1 \u2208 {b1 , . . . , bn } distinct from\nbk , bk+1 , bk+2 , bk+3 . Now, we can rotate \u03a0 around x1 and the origin until \u03a0\nmeets some x2 \u2208 {b1 , . . . , bn }, x2 6= bk , bk+1 , bk+2 , bk+3 , and so on. We have\nfreedom to rotate \u03a0 until it passes through (n\u22126) points x1 , . . . , xn\u22126 (where\nxi \u2208 {b1 , . . . , bn }, xi 6= bk , bk+1 , bk+2 , bk+3 ). Now \u03a0 separates Sn\u22126 into two\nhemispheres: one contains 4 points and another contains n \u2212 (n \u2212 6) \u2212 4 = 2\npoints. This contradicts the assumption that P have no pair of disjoint faces.\n21\n\n\fTherefore, no Lann\u00e9r subdiagram of \u03a3(P ) is of order 4. Similarly, it cannot\nbe of order greater than 4. Since no Lann\u00e9r subdiagram is of order 2, we\nobtain that the order of any Lann\u00e9r diagram equals 3.\nLemma 9. Let P be a simple hyperbolic Coxeter 4-polytope. If P has no\npair of disjoint facets, then P is either a simplex or one of seven Esselmann\npolytopes or the polytope shown in Fig. 2.\nProof. By Prop. 4.2.1, the diagram \u03a3(P ) contains no multi-multiple edges.\nLet \u03a3 \u2282 \u03a3(P ) be a subdiagram of order 6 (by Lemma 6, such a subdiagram does exist). By Lemma 8, we can assume that \u03a3 = hS1 , S2 i, where S1\nand S2 are Lann\u00e9r diagrams. There are only 11 Lann\u00e9r diagrams of order 3\ncontaining no edges of multiplicity greater than 5. We check all possible pairs\nof S1 and S2 (66 possibilities) and connect the vertices of S1 with the vertices\nof S2 by edges of all possible multiplicities (2, 3, 4, 5 for each of 6 edges). In\nall but 39 cases we obtain that dethS1 , S2 i =\n6 0. Further, 3 of these 39\ncases correspond to Esselmann diagrams; one diagram is the diagram of the\npolytope shown in Fig. 2; 4 diagrams contain parabolic subdiagrams of order\nless than 4; 11 of these 39 diagrams contain Lann\u00e9r subdiagrams of order 4,\nso they can not be subdiagrams of \u03a3(P ) by Lemma 8(b). We are left with\n20 diagrams none of which is a diagram of Coxeter 4-polytope: any of them\nhas order 6, but none of them is an Esselmann diagram or a diagram of a\n4-prism (see [5] and [8]). Therefore, \u03a3(P ) contains a subdiagram appearing\nin one of the lists L\u2032 (\u03a3, 5, 4), where \u03a3 ranges over the 20 diagrams mentioned\nabove. However, these lists are empty, and the lemma is proved.\n\n4.3\n\nDimension 5.\n\nIn this section we suppose that P is a simple hyperbolic Coxeter 5-polytope\nhaving no pair of disjoint facets. We also assume that P is not a simplex.\nProposition 4.3.1. \u03a3(P ) contains neither a subdiagram of the type F4 nor\na subdiagram of the type H4 .\nProof. Suppose that \u03a3(P ) contains a subdiagram S0 = F4 or H4 . Then by\nCor. 2, S 0 = \u03a3S0 , and \u03a3S0 contains no dotted edges. On the other hand,\nP (S0 ) is a 1-dimensional polytope, i.e. a segment, so \u03a3S0 should consist of a\ndotted edge.\n22\n\n\fProposition 4.3.2. \u03a3(P ) contains no multi-multiple edges.\n(k)\n\nProof. Suppose that \u03a3(P ) contains a multi-multiple edge. Choose S0 = G2 ,\nk \u2265 6, as an edge of maximal multiplicity in \u03a3(P ). Clearly, S0 has no good\nneighbors, and \u03a3(P ) contains a subdiagram appearing in the list L(5). But\nall diagrams from the list L(5) contain a subdiagram of the type H4 , which\ncontradicts Prop. 4.3.1.\nProposition 4.3.3. \u03a3(P ) contains no subdiagram of the type H3 .\nProof. Suppose that \u03a3(P ) contains a subdiagram S0 = H3 . It follows from\nProp 4.3.1 that S0 has no good neighbors. So, \u03a3(P ) contains a subdiagram\nPSfrag replacementsappearing in the list L(H3 , 5). The only diagram from the list L\u03b1 (H3 , 5)\ncontaining neither a multi-multiple edge nor a subdiagram of the type H4\nis shown in Fig. 7(a). In the list L\u03b2 (H3 , 5) there are two diagrams containing neither a multi-multiple edge nor a subdiagram of the type H4 ; these\ndiagrams are shown in Fig. 7(b) and 7(c).\n(d)\n(e)\n(f)(a)\n\n(c)\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 7: Intermediate results for d = 5, S0 = H3 .\nConsider the diagram \u03a3 shown in Fig. 7(a). By Lemma 6, \u03a3 is not a\ndiagram of a 5-polytope. Thus, if \u03a3(P ) contains \u03a3, then \u03a3(P ) also contains\nsome diagram from the list L\u2032 (\u03a3, 5, 5). Further, denote by S the subdiagram\nof \u03a3 of the type B4 . Then \u03a3S is the diagram of a Coxeter 1-polytope, i.e.\n\u03a3S contains two vertices. Therefore, \u03a3(P ) should contain a diagram from\nthe list L\u2032 (\u03a3, 5, 5, S (g,n)) which happens to be empty.\nNow, consider the diagrams shown in Fig. 7(b) and 7(c). By Lemma 6,\nnone of them is a diagram of a 5-polytope. Thus, if \u03a3(P ) contains one of\nthese two diagrams (denote it by \u03a3), then \u03a3(P ) also contains some diagram\nfrom the list L\u2032 (\u03a3, 5, 5). Furthermore, denote by S \u2282 \u03a3 a diagram of the\ntype H3 having 2 neighbors in \u03a3. By Prop. 4.3.2, S has no good neighbors\nin \u03a3(P ). Hence, the diagram \u03a3(P ) should contain a diagram from the list\nL\u2032 (\u03a3, 5, 5, S (n) ). This list turns out to be empty in both cases.\n23\n\n\fThe contradiction shows that the diagrams shown in Fig. 7(b) and 7(c)\ncannot be subdiagrams of \u03a3(P ), which finishes the proof.\n(5)\n\nProposition 4.3.4. \u03a3(P ) contains no subdiagram of the type G2 .\n(5)\n\nProof. Suppose that \u03a3(P ) \u2283 S0 = G2 . It follows from Prop. 4.3.3 that S0\nhas no good neighbors, so \u03a3(P ) contains a subdiagram appearing in the list\nL(S0 , 5). However, in the list L(S0 , 5) there is no diagram containing neither\na multi-multiple edge nor a subdiagram of the types H3 and F4 .\nIt follows from Prop. 4.3.2 and 4.3.4 that any multiple edge in \u03a3(P ) is a\ndouble edge.\nProposition 4.3.5. \u03a3(P ) contains no subdiagram of the type B4 .\nProof. Suppose that \u03a3(P ) \u2283 S0 = B4 . Then S 0 6= \u03a3S0 , since \u03a3S0 is a dotted\nedge and S 0 is not. Let u and v be the vertices of S 0 . By Theorem 2, at least\none of u and v is a good neighbor of S0 (we assume that u is a good neighbor,\ne4 , or C\ne4 ). Suppose that v is not a neighbor of S0 .\nso hS0 , ui is either B5 , or B\nThen by Theorem 2, v attaches to u. If [u, v] = 3, then hS0 , u, vi is either of\nthe type B6 , or contains a subdiagram of the type F4 , or is a quasi-Lann\u00e9r\ne5 or\ndiagram respectively. If [u, v] = 4, then hS0 , u, vi is either of the type C\ne2 or, again, is a quasi-Lann\u00e9r diagram.\ncontains a subdiagram of the type C\nNow recall that \u03a3(P ) contains neither quasi-Lann\u00e9r diagrams nor elliptic\ndiagrams of order greater than 5, and any connected parabolic subdiagram\nof \u03a3(P ) should be of order 5. Therefore, v is also a good neighbor of S0 ,\ne4 or C\ne4 , and the diagram \u03a3 = hS0 , u, vi\nthe diagram hS0 , vi is either B5 or B\ncoincides with one of the diagrams shown in Fig. 8(a)\u2013(g).\nSince \u03a3(P ) contains no multiple edges except for double edges, \u03a3(P )\ncontains also some diagram from the list L\u2032 (\u03a3, 4, 5). For the diagram from\nFig. 8(a) this list consists of the two diagrams shown in Fig. 8(h) and 8(i)\n(denote these diagrams by \u03a31 and \u03a32 ). As \u03a3 ranges over the diagrams\nshown in Fig. 8(b)\u2013(g), the only diagram from a list L\u2032 (\u03a3, 4, 5) which contains\nneither a subdiagram of type F4 nor a parabolic subdiagram of order less than\n5, is that shown in Fig. 8(j) (denote it by \u03a33 ).\nSimilarly, \u03a3(P ) contains some diagram appearing in either L\u2032 (\u03a31 , 4, 5) or\n\u2032\nL (\u03a32 , 4, 5) or L\u2032 (\u03a33 , 4, 5). The latter list is empty, and the former two coincide and consist of a unique diagram shown in Fig. 8(k). The latter diagram\ncontains a subdiagram of the type F4 , and we come to a contradiction.\n24\n\n\fPSfrag replacements\n\n(c)\n\n(b)\n\n(a)\n\n(d)\n\n(e)\n\n(f)\n\n(h)\n\n(i)\n\n(j)\n\n(g)\n\n(k)\n\nFigure 8: Intermediate results for d = 5, S0 = B4 .\n\nProposition 4.3.6. \u03a3(P ) contains no subdiagram of the type B3 .\nProof.

Suppose that P is not a simplex and P has no pair of disjoint facets.\nBy Prop. 4.3.2, 4.3.4 and 4.3.7, \u03a3(P ) contains no multiple edges. At the\nsame time, any Lann\u00e9r diagram of order greater than 2 contains a multiple\nedge. Hence, \u03a3(P ) contains no Lann\u00e9r diagram of order greater than 2. By\n25\n\n\fCor. 1, \u03a3(P ) contains no quasi-Lann\u00e9r diagram as well.

Suppose that \u03a3(P ) \u2283 S0 = B5 . The same argument as in Prop 4.3.5\nshows that \u03a3(P ) contains a subdiagram \u03a3 which coincides with one of the\ndiagrams shown in Fig. 11(a)\u2013(g).

Now the proof follows the proof of Lemma 10.\n\n29\n\n\f4.5\n\nLarge dimensions.\n\nIn this section we assume that P is a simple hyperbolic Coxeter d-polytope\n(d \u2265 7) containing no pair of disjoint facets, and P is not a simplex. We also\nassume that P is such a polytope of minimal possible dimension. We recall\nthat \u03a3(P ) contains no quasi-Lann\u00e9r diagrams (see Cor. 1), so if S0 \u2282 \u03a3(P )\nis an elliptic diagram, S 0 = \u03a3S0 , and \u03a3S0 does not contain dotted edges, then\nthe dimension of P (S0 ) is at most 4.\nProposition 4.5.1. \u03a3(P ) contains no multi-multiple edges.\n(k)\n\nProof. Suppose that \u03a3(P ) contains a subdiagram S0 = G2 for some k > 5.\nThen S0 has no good neighbors. Therefore, P (S0) is a Coxeter (d \u2212 2)polytope without a pair of disjoint facets, and we contradict our assumptions.\nProposition 4.5.2. \u03a3(P ) contains neither subdiagram of the type H4 nor\nsubdiagram of the type F4 .\nProof. Suppose that \u03a3(P ) contains a subdiagram S0 = H4 or F4 .\nFor d = 7 we check the lists L(S0 , d). The union of these lists for S0 =\nH4 and F4 consists of four diagrams \u03a31 , . . . , \u03a34 shown in Fig. 13(a)\u2013(d).\nDenote by S a subdiagram of \u03a3i of type H4 having either two (i = 1, 2) or\nthree (i = 3, 4) bad neighbors. Since any neighbor of S is bad and none\nof \u03a3i is a diagram of a 7-polytope, \u03a3(P ) contains a subdiagram from the\nlist L\u2032 (\u03a3i , 5, 7, S (n)) for some i \u2264 4. The lists L\u2032 (\u03a3i , 5, 7, S (n) ) for i = 1, 2, 3\nare empty, and the list L\u2032 (\u03a34 , 5, 7, S (n) ) consists of a unique diagram \u03a3\u20324\nshown in Fig. 13(e). Again, \u03a3(P ) should contain a subdiagram from the list\nL\u2032 (\u03a3\u20321 , 5, 7, S (n) ) for the same S. However, this list is empty.\nPSfrag replacements\n(a)\n\n(c)\n\n(b)\n\n(d)\n\n(e)\n\nFigure 13: Intermediate results for d = 7, S0 = H4 and F4 .\n\n30\n\n\fFor d = 8 we check the lists L(S0 , d) which turn out to be empty.\nFor d > 8 consider the (d \u2212 4)-polytope P (S0). By Cor. 2, \u03a3S0 = S 0 . It\nfollows that \u03a3S0 contains no dotted edges and P (S0 ) is a Coxeter (d \u2212 4)polytope without pair of disjoint facets. If d = 9 or d = 10, this contradicts\nLemmas 10 and 11 respectively. If d > 10, this contradicts the assumption\nthat d is the minimal possible dimension of such a polytope.\nProposition 4.5.3. \u03a3(P ) contains no subdiagram of the type H3 .\nProof. Suppose that \u03a3(P ) contains a subdiagram S0 = H3 . By Prop. 4.5.2,\nS0 has no good neighbors. Thus, it follows from Cor. 2 that P (S0 ) is a\nCoxeter (d \u2212 3)-polytope without a pair of disjoint facets. If d > 7 then as\nin Prop. 4.5.2 we have a contradiction.\nSuppose that d = 7. Then S 0 is either a Lann\u00e9r diagram of order 5 or\none of the Esselmann diagrams. In any case, S 0 contains either a subdiagram of the type H4 or a subdiagram of the type F4 , which is impossible by\nProp. 4.5.2.\n(5)\n\nProposition 4.5.4. \u03a3(P ) contains no subdiagram of the type G2 .\n(5)\n\nProof. Suppose that \u03a3(P ) contains a subdiagram S0 = G2 . Since \u03a3(P )\ncontains no subdiagram of the type H3 (Prop. 4.5.3), S0 has no good neighbors. Thus, P (S0 ) is a Coxeter (d \u2212 2)-polytope without a pair of disjoint\nfacets, and we come to a contradiction.\nAs a corollary of Prop. 4.5.4, we may assume that all multiple edges in \u03a3(P )\nare double edges.\nProposition 4.5.5. Any Lann\u00e9r subdiagram of \u03a3(P ) is one of the five diagrams shown in Fig. 14.\nProof. By the assumption \u03a3(P ) contains no Lann\u00e9r diagrams of order 2.\nThus, the statement follows from the classification of Lann\u00e9r diagrams and\nProp. 4.5.4.\n\n31\n\n\fPSfrag replacements\n\nL1\n\nL2\n\nL3\n\nL4\n\nL5\n\nFigure 14: Notation for some Lann\u00e9r diagrams.\n\nProposition 4.5.6. If \u03a3(P ) contains a subdiagram S = B3 or B2 then S\nhas at least 2 good neighbors. In addition, for any good neighbor u of S the\ndiagram hS, ui is of the type B4 or B3 , respectively.\nProof. Consider the Coxeter polytope P (S). Suppose that P (S) has no pair\nof disjoint facets. Then, by assumption, the dimension of P (S) is at most 4,\nwhich means that d = 7 and S = B3 (see Lemmas 4.3 and 4.4). As in the\nproof of Prop. 4.5.3, \u03a3S contains a subdiagram \u03a3 = H4 or F4 . By Cor. 2, S\nalso contains \u03a3, which contradicts Prop. 4.5.2.\nNow we may assume that P (S) has a pair of disjoint facets. Let v and\nu be the vertices of \u03a3S joined by a dotted edge. Denote by v\u0304 and \u016b the\ncorresponding vertices of \u03a3(P ). In view of Theorem 2, we may assume that\none of v and u, say v, is a good neighbor of S (otherwise [v, u] = [v\u0304, \u016b] 6= \u221e).\nSuppose that u is not a neighbor of S. By Prop. 4.5.4, [v\u0304, \u016b] \u2264 4. If [v\u0304, \u016b] = 4\ne4 or C\ne3 which are parabolic of small order. Thus, [v\u0304, \u016b] = 2\nthen hS, \u016b, v\u0304i = C\nor 3. By item (2b) of Theorem 2, we have [v, u] = 2 or 4 respectively in\ncontradiction to the assumption that [v, u] = \u221e. Therefore, u is also a good\nneighbor of S.\nBy Prop. 2.1.1, hS, ui is not parabolic, and Prop. 4.5.2 implies that\nhS, ui =\n6 F4 , which finishes the proof.\nProposition 4.5.7. \u03a3(P ) contains no subdiagram of the type L1 (see Fig. 14).\nProof. Suppose the contrary. Denote the vertices of the subdiagram as shown\nin Fig. 15(a). By Prop 4.5.6, the subdiagram B3 = hx1 , x2 , x3 i has at\nleast 2 good neighbors y1 and y2 . By Prop. 4.5.6, hx1 , x2 , x3 , yi i = B4 for\ni = 1, 2.

Suppose the contrary. Denote the vertices of the subdiagram as\nshown in Fig. 16(a). By Prop 4.5.6, the subdiagram B3 = hx1 , x2 , x3 i has\nat least 2 good neighbors y1 and y2 . By Prop 4.5.6, hx1 , x2 , x3 , yi i = B4 .\nClearly, [y1 , y2 ] = 4 (see the proof of Prop. 4.5.7). Further, [yi , x4 ] 6= 2 and\ne3 or\n[yi , x4 ] 6= 4 (otherwise we have a parabolic subdiagram hx2 , x3 , x4 , yi i = B\ne3 respectively).

Consider good\nneighbors z1 and z2 of the subdiagram B2 = hx1 , x3 i. Without loss of generality, we may assume that z1 and z2 are neighbors of x3 . By the assumption,\nz1 and z2 are not neighbors of x1 and x2 (otherwise hx1 , x2 , x3 , z1 , z2 i is a\nsubdiagram of the type shown in Fig. 17(c)). It follows that the subdiagram\n34\n\n\fhz1 , x3 , x2 , y1 i is either F4 (forbidden by Prop. 4.5.2) or a cyclic Lann\u00e9r diagram (forbidden by Prop. 4.5.7 and 4.5.8). We come to a contradiction which\nshows that \u03a3(P ) contains a subdiagram of the type shown in Fig. 17(c). We\nnow assume that hx1 , x2 , x3 , y1 , y2 i is this subdiagram.\nConsider two good neighbors t1 and t2 of the subdiagram B3 = hx1 , x2 , y2 i.\nWe have\ne2 or hx1 , x3 , ti i = C\ne2 );\n1) [ti , x3 ] = 2 (otherwise either hti , y2, x3 i = A\ne2 or hx1 , x2 , y2, t1 , t2 i = B\ne4 );\n2) [t1 , t2 ] = 4 (otherwise either ht1 , t2 , y2 i = A\ne3 );\n3) [ti , y1 ] 6= 4 (otherwise hx1 , x3 , y1 , ti i = C\n4) either [t1 , y1 ] = [t2 , y2 ] = 3 or [t1 , y1] = [t2 , y2 ] = 2 (otherwise\ne4 ).\nhx1 , x3 , y1 , t1 , t2 i = C\nTherefore, hx1 , x2 , x3 , y1 , y2 , t1 , t2 i is one of two diagrams shown in Fig. 17(d)\nand 17(e). The diagram shown in Fig. 17(d) is superhyperbolic. Thus,\nhx1 , x2 , x3 , y1, y2 , t1 , t2 i is the diagram shown in Fig. 17(e).\nConsider two good neighbors q1 and q2 of the subdiagram B3 = hx1 , x3 , y1 i.\nReasoning as above shows that the subdiagram hx1 , x2 , x3 , y1 , y2, q1 , q2 i looks\nlike the diagram shown in Fig. 17(f). Then the subdiagram hq1 , y1 , y2 , t1 i is\neither F4 (forbidden by Prop. 4.5.2) or a cyclic Lann\u00e9r diagram (forbidden\nby Prop. 4.5.7 and 4.5.8). The contradiction proves the statement.\nProposition 4.5.10. \u03a3(P ) contains no subdiagram of the type B2 .\nProof. Suppose the contrary. Let hx1 , x2 i be the vertices of B2 .

We have [zi , x2 ] 6= 3\ne2 ). If [z1 , x2 ] = 4, then [z2 , x2 ] = 4 (otherwise\n(otherwise hx2 , y2, zi i = A\ne2 ), and hz1 , z2 , x2 i = L5 , which contradicts Prop. 4.5.9. So,\nhz1 , z2 , x2 i = C\n[zi , x2 ] = 2. Furthermore, [zi , x1 ] = 2, otherwise the cycle hx1 , x2 , y2, zi i = L1\nor L2 , which contradicts Prop. 4.5.7 and 4.5.8. Thus, hx1 , x2 , y1 , y2, z1 , z2 i is\nthe diagram shown in Fig. 18(b).\nLet t1 and t2 be two good neighbors of B2 = hz1 , z2 i. Repeating the argument above we obtain that ti is not connected to z1 , y2 and y1 . Moreover,\n[ti , x2 ] = 2 (see hx2 , y2 , z2 , ti i), and [ti , x1 ] = 2 (otherwise either ht2 , x1 , x2 i =\ne2 or hti , x1 , x2 , y1 i = F4 ). Thus, hx1 , x2 , y1, y2 , z1 , z2 , t1 , t2 i is the diagram\nC\nshown in Fig. 18(c).
