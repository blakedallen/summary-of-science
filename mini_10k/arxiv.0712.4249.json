Several important results have been obtained in the few last years;\nin particular the development of the topological tri-vertex ( to which we refer below as\nplanar 3-vertex) method for computing the A-model partition function for non compact\ntoric CY3s [28, 29] and the interpretation of this vertex in terms of 3d-partitions of\nmelting crystals generalizing U (\u221e) Young tableau [30, 31].\nMoreover the planar 3-vertex and its refined version [32, 33] have been shown\nparticularly powerful. They agree with the Nekrasov's partition function of N = 2\nSU(N) gauge theory [34]-[40] and provide more insights into non perturbative dynamics\nof string field theory. The power of the topological 3-vertex method may be compared\nwith the power of Feynman graphs technique in perturbative \u03c63 quantum field theory\n(QFT). This formal similarity between the toric web-diagrams and the Feynman graphs\nopens a window on the following issues:\nFirst, the use of perturbative QFT results to motivate topological stringy analogues, in\nparticular toric web-diagrams with higher dimensional vertices such as the typical \u03c64 to\nbe considered in this study;\nSecond, the development of new techniques to enlarge the class of toric Calabi-Yau\nthreefolds to which the topological vertex formalism applies.\nRecall that for non compact toric Calabi-Yau threefolds X3 with toric webdiagram \u2206 (X3 ), the planar 3-vertex method allows to compute explicitly the A- model\ntopological string amplitudes. The topological vertex method is a Feynman-rules like\ntechnique where the Feynman graphs, the vertices of these graphs, the momenta, and\nthe propagators correspond respectively to the toric web-diagrams \u2206 (X3 ), the 3-valent\nn\nvertices C\u03bb\u03bc\u03bd , Young diagrams \u03bb, and the weights (\u2212)(n+1)|\u03bb| e\u2212t|\u03bb| q \u2212 2 \u03ba(\u03bb) where n encodes\nthe framing.\nMotivated by:\n(1) the formal correspondence between toric web-diagrams of local Calabi-Yau threefolds\nand QFT Feynman graphs,\n(2) the two classes of toric Calabi-Yau threefolds describing the vacua of supersymmetric\nsigma model with (W(\u03a6i ) 6= 0) and without superpotential (W(\u03a6i ) = 0) , and\n(3) a special feature1 of the local 2- torus O(m) \u2295 O(\u2212m) \u2192 E (t,\u221e) where the elliptic\n1\n\nIn toric Calabi-Yau 3-folds X3 with typical fibration B \u00d7 F , the torii appear generally in the fiber\nF . In the local elliptic curve we are considering in this paper, the 2-torus is in the base B.\n\n2\n\n\fcurve2\nE (t,\u03bc)\n\n(1.1)\n\nis in the base of the local Calabi-Yau threefold X (m,\u2212m,0) rather than in the fiber,\nwe address in this paper, the two following points:\n(a) We propose in this study a toric representation for the family of the local 2-torii with\nfixed finite Kahler parameter t and a large complex structure \u03bc; say |\u03bc| \u2212\u2192 \u221e,\nO(m) \u2295 O(\u2212m) \u2192 E (t,\u221e) ,\n\n(1.2)\n\nwith integer m. The degenerate elliptic curve\nE (t,\u221e) ,\n\n(1.3)\n\ndescribing the base of the above local Calabi-Yau threefolds (1.2), will be realized as the\n(toric) boundary of the complex toric projective plane P2 ; see sections 3, 5 and 6 as well\nas the appendix for more details.\nWith this representation at hand, we can then:\n(\u03b1) circumvent, at least for the particular case of the degenerate E (t,\u221e) , the usual difficulty regarding the lack of a toric diagram for the 2-torus.\nIn addition to the large complex structure limit constraint |\u03bc| \u2192 \u221e, the other price\nto pay in this set up is to consider a non planar 3-vertex formalism rather than the\nstandard planar 3-vertex one based on the R \u00d7 T 2 special Lagrangian fibration of C3 .\nThe reason behind the emergence of the non planar 3-vertex is that the toric CalabiYau 3-fold X (m,\u2212m,0) is realized as a non compact toric hypersurface of the complex four\ndimensional toric manifold\nO(m) \u2295 O(\u2212m) \u2192 P2 .\n(1.4)\nFor later use, we will refer to the local geometries (1.2) and (1.4) as H3 and Y4 respectively.\nThe geometry Y4 will be also promoted to the Calab-Yau 4-fold X4 = O(\u2212m \u2212 3) \u2192\nW P31,1,1,m .\n(\u03b2) draw the lines for computing the topological amplitudes by using a non planar 3vertex formalism.\nIn the present study, we will mainly set up the key idea by:\n(i) building the toric web-diagram \u2206 (X3 ) of the local degenerate elliptic curve X (m,\u2212m,0) .\n(ii) give first results regarding the structure of the topological non planar 3-vertex and\n2\n\nthe 2-torus has one Kahler parameter t and one complex parameter \u03bc. As these parameters play\nan important role here, we will exhibit them below by referring to the elliptic curve as E (t,\u03bc) . Further\ndetails are given in the appendix.\n\n3\n\n\fthe partition function of X (m,\u2212m,0) as well as their relation to the 4- vertex of the ambient\nC4 local patch and to the generalized Young diagrams.\n(b) We develop the supersymmetric linear sigma model field theory setting of the local\ndegenerate elliptic curve X (m,\u2212m,0) .\nMore precisely, we show the two main following things:\n(\u03b1) the planar 3-vertex method is associated with the auxiliary D-terms in supersymmetric sigma models.\nThe non planar 3-vertex formalism we will be considering here corresponds to the case\nwhere we have both D-terms and F-terms.\n(\u03b2) We use the sigma model for local P2 to induce the N = 2 supersymmetric gauged\nmodel for the local elliptic curve X (m,\u2212m,0) . The underlying complex geometry of a such\nconstruction was noticed in the Witten's original work [47]. Here, we give explicit details\nregarding the implementation of F-terms.\nThe organization of this paper is as follows: In section 2, we give an overview\nof the topological planar 3- vertex method. In section 3, we exhibit briefly first results\nconcerning the topological non planar 3-vertex by considering the example of a CalabiYau threefold H3 . The toric 3-fold H3 is realized as a hypersurface of a four dimensional\ncomplex Kahler manifold. In section 4, we review the main points of the U (1) gauged\nsupersymmetric sigma model realization of the local P2 . In section 5, we consider the\nsigma model for the degenerate local elliptic curve X (m,\u2212m,0) . As the question of the\ntoric realization of T2 is a crucial point, we divide this section in three parts: We first\nstudy the realization of the degenerate elliptic curve E (t,\u221e) by using the compact divisor\nof P2 . Then we give explicit details regarding the U (1) gauged supersymmetric sigma\nmodel realization of the local degenerate elliptic curve X (m,\u2212m,0) . Next, we study the\nmoduli space of the supersymmetric vacua associated with X (3,\u22123,0) . In section 6, we\nextend the construction to the case of local elliptic curve X (m,\u2212m,0) . In section 7, we\ngive the conclusion and in section 8 we give an appendix where we show that \u2202 (P2 ) is\nprecisely E (t,\u221e) .\n\n2\n\nTopological vertex method\n\nIn this section, we consider the topological 3-vertex method used for the computation of the A- model topological string amplitudes. We illustrate this method through\nsome examples of non compact toric Calabi-Yau threefolds namely:\n(1) the complex space C3 , with special Lagrangian fibration as R \u00d7 T 2 , playing the role\nof the planar 3-vertex.\n(2) the resolved conifold obtained by gluing two planar 3-vertices,\n4\n\n\f(3) local P2 made of three planar 3-vertices.\nThen, we consider an example of toric Calabi-Yau threefold (1.2) where one needs introducing non planar 3-vertices (and 4-vertices). This local Calabi-Yau threefold is precisely\nthe one given by the local degenerate elliptic curve X (m,\u2212m,0) = O(m)\u2295O(\u2212m) \u2192 E (t,\u221e)\nrealized as a hypersurface in (1.4).\n\n2.1\n\nTri-vertex method: A brief review\nThe topological 3-vertex formalism computes the partition function\nZX3 (q)\n\nof the local toric Calabi-Yau threefolds X3 . In this formalism, the toric web-diagram\nof X3 is thought of as resulting from gluing copies of planar 3-vertices C\u03bb\u03bc\u03bd along their\nedges.\nRecall that the topological vertex C\u03bb\u03bc\u03bd has three legs ending on stacks of Lagrangian\nD-branes (C \u00d7 S 1 ) represented by 2d partitions \u03bb, \u03bc and \u03bd.\nThe partition function ZX3 (q) depends on the following quantities:\n(i) the parameter q which reads in terms of the string coupling as e\u2212gs ; it plays the role\nof the Boltzmann weight.\n(ii) the Kahler parameters {ti } of the local Calabi-Yau threefold X3 ( i = 1, ..., h1,1 (X3 )).\nBelow, we will consider simple examples where\nh1,1 (X3 ) = 1.\n(iii) the boundary conditions (open strings) described by 2d partitions \u03bc ( generic representations of U (\u221e)). In the QFT language where Feynman graphs play a quite similar\nrole as the toric web-diagrams, the 2d partition \u03bc corresponds to the \"external momentum\" of Feynman graph. Recall that a 2d partition \u03bc is a Young diagram with columns\n(\u03bc1 , \u03bc2 , ...) ,\n\n\u03bci \u2265 \u03bci+1 ,\n\n\u03bci \u2208 Z+ .\n\n(2.1)\n\nColumns of the 2d partition are associated with Lagrangian D- branes and rows with\nLagrangian anti- D-branes.\n(iv) Lagrangian D-brane/anti-D-brane pairs are needed for the gluing of the vertices.\nThe gluing operation is achieved by inserting 2d partitions \u03bd and their transpose \u03bd T at\nthe cuts and summing over all possible \u03bd's. In QFT language, \u03bd corresponds to \"internal\nmomenta\".\nThe topological 3-vertex3 method for computing the partition function ZX3 (q) is illustrated on the three examples given below.\n3\n\nFor simplicity, we use 3-vertex to refer to the planar 3-vertex.\n\n5\n\n\f2.2\n\nExamples\n\nExample 1 : the 3-vertex of C3\nThe toric graph of C3 is given by figure 1.

The full triangles ABD,\nZCD, BCD refer to the three other projective planes.\n\nThe non compact toric 4- fold Y4 of eq(3.4) is given by\n3\nY4 = O(\u22123) \u2192 W P1,1,1,3\n,\n\n(3.10)\n\n3\nwhere W P1,1,1,3\nstands for the complex 3- dimension weighted projective space.

This figure looks like a \"toric cap\"\n\nobtained by gluing three triangles as shown on the figure.\n\nThe toric web-diagram of the complex surface Y2 is exhibited in figure 5:\n\nThe first Chern class c1 (T \u2217 Y2 ) is equal to +3. The toric web-diagram of E (t,\u221e) is given\nby the boundary of the triangle and O(+3) is a compact line.\nThe toric web-diagram of Y2 is non planar and can be thought of as the triangulation of\nthe topological cap of [28]. Below, we will refer to Y2 as the \"toric cap\". Notice also the\nfollowing features:\n(a) the complex surface Y2 is a compact divisor of H3 ; it is made of the union of three\ncomplex projective planes, which we denote as P21 , P22 and P23 .\nThe projective planes P2i belong to three different C3 spaces of the ambient C4 .\n(b) the toric web-diagram of Y2 is made of three triangles as shown4 in the figure 6.\nRecall that the toric web-diagram of a generic projective plane is given by a triangle\n(figure 3 ).\nThe projective planes (triangles) have mutual intersections Iij along complex projective\nlines (edges) and a non planar tri-intersection vertex I123 .\n(2) toric cylinder\nThis divisor corresponds to think about H3 as the fibration O(+3) \u2192 Ye2 .\nHere the base Ye2 is a non compact complex surface given by\nYe2 = O(\u22123) \u2192 E (t,\u221e) .\n\n(3.14)\n\u0010\n\u0011\nIts first Chern class c1 T \u2217 Ye2 is equal to \u22123. Here also the toric web-diagram of E (t,\u221e)\nis the boundary of the triangle and O(\u22123) is a non compact line. The toric web-diagram\nof Ye2 is non planar ; it can be thought of as the triangulation of the cylinder R \u00d7 S1 . We\nwill refer to Ye2 as the \"toric cylinder\" whose toric web-diagram is shown in the figure 7.\n4\n\nY2 can be imagined as the triangulation of the cap.\n\n11\n\n\fFigure 7: On left, the real skeleton of the toric web-diagram of the fibration of O (\u22123) \u2192\nE (t,\u221e) . It could be interpreted as a triangulation of the cylinder of base E (t,\u03bc) , given by the\nboundary of a triangle, and a non compact line as a fiber. On right, the usual cylinder R \u00d7 S 1 .\nThe Ye2 divisor of H3 is made of the union of three sheets O(\u22123) \u2192 P1i belonging to three\ndifferent C3 spaces of the ambient C4 .\nFrom eqs(3.13) and (3.14), it is clear that the elliptic curve E (t,\u221e) is an intersecting curve\nof the complex surfaces Y2 and Ye2 .\n\n3.3\n\nTopological partition function\n\nTo build the non planar 3-vertex formalism for the local elliptic curve H3 , we will follow\nthe construction used in the derivation of the usual topological 3-vertex method [28].\nHowever since the local elliptic curve is a CY3 hypersurface in X4 ,\nH 3 \u2282 X4 ,\n\n(3.15)\n\n3\nX4 = O(\u22123 \u2212 m) \u2192 W P1,1,1,m\n,\n\n(3.16)\n\nwith\na convenient way to achieve the goal is to proceed as follows:\n(1) develop the 4-vertex formalism for the ambient toric CY4-fold X4 .\n(2) compute the partition function for X4 . Actually this step may be also viewed as\nalternative way to get the 4d generalization of the MacMahon function [50].\n(3) impose the appropriate constraint relations to get the non planar 3-vertex and the\ntopological partition function for the local elliptic curve H3 .\nIt is interesting to note here the emergence of a 4-vertex formalism in the construction.\nThis is not surprising since the toric web-diagrams of H3 and X4 have quite similar\nskeletons. In the first case the tetrahedron is hollow and in the second it is full.\nThe first step to realize these objectives is specify the special lagrangian fibration of\nthe toric CY4-fold like X4 \u223c R4 \u00d7 F4 with fiber taken as\nF4 \u223c R \u00d7 T 3 .\n\n12\n\n(3.17)\n\n\fOn the hypersurface H3 in X4 , real 1-cycles of F4 shrink and one is left with the usual\nspecial lagrangian fibration of the toric CY3-folds H3 \u223c R3 \u00d7 F3 with\nF3 \u223c R \u00d7 T 2 .\n\n(3.18)\n\nIn [49], we give the explicit expressions of the various hamiltonians and the values of the\nvertices of the web-diagrams solving the Calabi-Yau conditions.\nThe next step is to study the 4-vertex formalism of X4 and its reduction down to the\ntoric hypersurface H3 .\n3.3.1\n\nToric web-diagrams and generalized partitions\n\nThe toric web-diagrams of X4 and H3 have been described above (figure 5 ). For the case\nX4 , the toric web-diagram can be decomposed into four local patches\nU1 ,\n\nU2 ,\n\nU3 ,\n\nU4 .\n\n(3.19)\n\nTo each patch Ui \u223c C4 with fibration R4 \u00d7 F4 it is associated a topological 4-vertex C(4) .\nThis vertex depends on the boundary conditions on its external legs. We will see that,\nusing 3d generalized Young diagrams, it can be either defined as\nC(4) = C\u039b\u03a3\u03a5\u0393 ,\n\n(3.20)\n\nor equivalently by using 2d partition like\nC(4) = C(\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3)(\u03b4\u01eb\u03b5)(\u03b6\u03b7\u03b8)(\u03bb\u03bc\u03bd) .\n\n(3.21)\n\nThe toric web-diagram of H3 is induced from the one of X4 . It can be also decomposed\ninto four local patches as follows,\nU1\u2217 ,\n\nU2\u2217 ,\n\nU3\u2217 ,\n\nU4\u2217 ,\n\n(3.22)\n\nUi \u2192 Ui\u2217 .\n\n(3.23)\n\nwhere the asterix refers to the projection\n\u2217 : X4 \u2192 H 3 ,\n\nTo each patch Ui\u2217 \u223c C3 with fibration R3 \u00d7 F3 it is associated a non planar topological\n\u2217\n,\n3-vertex C(3)\n\u2217\n\u2217 : C(4) \u2192 C(3)\n.\n(3.24)\nTo get the 4- vertex C(4) , the partition function ZX4 and the topological partition function\nZH3 of the local elliptic curve, we need first introducing some key tools.\nIn the standard 3-vertex formalism of [28, 30], one uses a set of basic objects; in particular\n2d- and 3d- partitions. In the 4-vertex formalism, we have to build the analogue of these\nmathematical ingredients.\n13\n\n\f\u03b1) 3d partitions\nRoughly, a 3d partition \u03a0 can be thought of as an integral N1 \u00d7 N2 rank two tensor\n(\u03a0ia ) with the property,\n\u03a0 = {\u03a0i,a \u2208 Z+ ,\n\n\u03a0i,a \u2265 \u03a0i+j,a+b \u2265 0} ,\n\n(3.25)\n\nwhere i, j = 1, 2, ..., N1 and a, b = 1, 2, ..., N2 .\nThe 3d partition, which has been used for various purposes, has a set of remarkable\ncombinatorial features. Below, we give useful ones.\n(i) 3d partitions are generalizations of the usual 2d partitions \u03bb = (\u03bb1 , \u03bb2 , ...) with\n\u03bb1 \u2265 \u03bb2 \u2265 .... \u2265 0 and the integers \u03bbi \u2208 Z+ .\nBy setting N3 = \u03a01,1 , the 3d partitions can be imagined as a cubic sublattice of Z3+\n[1, N1 ] \u00d7 [1, N2 ] \u00d7 [1, N3 ] .\n\n(3.26)\n\nThe cubic diagram of \u03a0 can be considered as a set of unit cubes (i, j, k) with integer\ncoordinates such that (i, j) \u2208 \u03bb and 1 \u2264 k \u2264 \u03a0(i, j). The integers \u03a0(i, j) define the\nheight of the stack of cubes on the (x1 , x2 ) plane. The projection of \u03a0 on the (x1 , x2 )\nplane is just the 2d partition \u03bb.\n(ii) A subclass of 3d partitions solving the conditions (3.25) is given by the particular\nrepresentation\n\u03a0 = \u03bb \u2297 \u03bc,\n\u03a0ia = \u03bbi \u03bca ,\n\u03bbi \u03bca \u2265 \u03bbi+j \u03bca+b ,\n(3.27)\nwhere \u03bb and \u03bc are 2d partitions as in eq(2.1).\nWe also have the following associated ones:\n\u03a0T = \u03bbT \u2297 \u03bc,\n\ne = \u03bb \u2297 \u03bcT ,\n\u03a0\n\nfT = \u03bbT \u2297 \u03bcT ,\n\u03a0\n\n(3.28)\n\nwhere \u03bbT stands for the usual transpose of the Young diagram \u03bb.\n(iii) Like in the case of 2d partitions, one may associate to each 3d partition \u03a0 a Fock\nspace state |\u03a0ia i with norm h\u03a0|\u03a0i \u2261 k\u03a0k2 ,\n!\n!\nX\nX\nX\nX\nk\u03a0k2 =\n(\u03a0ia )2 =\n(\u03a0ia )2 .\n(3.29)\ni\u22651\n\na\u22651\n\na\u22651\n\ni\u22651\n\nfT . We also\nh\u03a0ia | stands for the dual state associated with the dual partition \u03a0+ = \u03a0\nhave the following relation\nX\nIid =\n|\u03a0ia i h\u03a0ia | ,\nh\u03a0ia |\u03a0jb i = \u03b4 ij \u03b4 ab ,\n(3.30)\n3d partitions\n\n14\n\n\fdefining the resolution of the identity operator Iid .\n(iv) The number |\u03a0| of unit boxes (cubes) of the 3d partition is defined as\n|\u03a0| =\n\nX\n\n\u03a0i,a .\n\n(3.31)\n\ni,a\n\n(v) The boundary (\u2202\u03a0) of the 3d partition \u03a0 is given by the 2d profile of the corresponding generalized Young diagram. As this property is important for the present study, let\ngive some details.\nGiven a 3d partition \u03a0, the boundary term on the plane xi = Ni is a Young diagram\n(2d partition). On the planes x1 = N1 , x2 = N2 and x3 = N3 , the boundary of \u03a0 is\ncomposed of by three 2d partitions \u03bb, \u03bc and \u03bd. So we then have:\n\u2202\u03a0 = (\u03bb, \u03bc, \u03bd) .\n\n(3.32)\n\nParticular boundaries are given by the case where a 2d partition is located at infinity;\nthat is there is no boundary. We distinguish the following situations:\n\u2202\u03a0 = (\u2205, \u03bc, \u03bd) ,\n\u2202\u03a0 = (\u2205, \u2205, \u03bd) ,\n\n(3.33)\n\n\u2202\u03a0 = (\u2205, \u2205, \u2205) ,\n\nwhere \u2205 stands for the vacuum.\n(vi) A convenient way to deal with 3d partitions is to slice them as a sequence of 2d\npartitions with interlacing relations. We mainly distinguish two kinds of sequences of\n2d partitions: perpendicular and diagonal. We will not need this property here; but for\ndetails on this matter see for instance [30] and refs therein.\n\u03b2) 4d partitions\nThe 4d partitions P are extensions of the 3d partitions \u03a0 considered above. They can\nbe imagined as 4d generalized Young diagrams described by the typical integral rank 3tensor ,\nPia\u03b1 \u2208 Z+ ,\nwith\nPia\u03b1 \u2265 P(i+j)(a+b)(\u03b1+\u03b2) ,\n(3.34)\nwith 1 \u2264 i \u2264 N1 , 1 \u2264 a \u2264 N2 and 1 \u2264 \u03b1 \u2264 N3 .\nSeveral properties of 2d and 3d partitions extend to the 4d case; there are also specific\nproperties in particular those concerning their slicing into lower dimensional ones. Below\nwe describe some particular properties of 4d partitions by considering special representations.\n\n15\n\n\fSub-classes of 4d partitions are given by:\n(i) the product of a 2d- and a 3d- partitions \u03bc and \u03a0 like\nP = \u03bc \u2297 \u03a0,\n\n(Pia\u03b1 ) = (\u03bci \u03a0a\u03b1 ) ,\n\n(3.35)\n\nwith i = 1, ..., N1 ; a = 1, ..., N2 and \u03b1 = 1, ..., N3 .\n(ii) the product of three kinds of 2d- partitions.\nP = \u03bb \u2297 \u03bc \u2297 \u03bd,\n\n(Pia\u03b1 ) = (\u03bbi \u03bca \u03bd \u03b1 ) .\n\n(3.36)\n\nThe boundary \u2202P of a generic 4d partition P can be defined in two ways. First in terms\nof 3d partitions as follows\n\u2202P = (\u039b, \u03a0, \u03a3, \u03a5) .\n(3.37)\nWe also have the following particular boundary conditions\ncase I : \u2202P = (\u2205, \u03a0, \u03a3, \u03a5) ,\ncase II : \u2202P = (\u2205, \u2205, \u03a3, \u03a5) ,\ncase III : \u2202P = (\u2205, \u2205, \u2205, \u03a5) ,\n\n(3.38)\n\ncase IV : \u2202P = (\u2205, \u2205, \u2205, \u2205) ,\nwhere \u2205 stands for the the \"3d vacuum\" (no boundary condition).\nSecond by using 2d partitions to define boundary of P like\n\u2202P = ( [a, b, c] ; [d, e, f] ; [g, h, i] ; [j, k, l] ) ,\n\n(3.39)\n\nwhere [abc], ...and [jkl] stand for the boundaries of the 3d partitions \u039b, ... and \u03a5.\nNotice that the second representation is more richer since along with the configuration\n\u2205 = [\u2205, \u2205, \u2205] ,\n\n(3.40)\n\nwe have moreover the two following extra configurations\n[\u2205, \u2205, c] .\n\n[\u2205, b, c] ,\n\nFor the case I of eq(3.38) corresponds then the three following\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\ncase i :\n([\u2205, b, c] ; [d, e, f] ; [g, h, i] ;\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\n\u2202P =\ncase ii :\n([\u2205, \u2205, c] ; [d, e, f] ; [g, h, i] ;\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3 case iii :\n([\u2205, \u2205, \u2205] ; [d, e, f] ; [g, h, i] ;\n16\n\n(3.41)\nboundary configurations\n[j, k, l])\n[j, k, l])\n[j, k, l])\n\n,\n\n(3.42)\n\n\fwhere the last one (case iii) is the case I described by the first relation of eq(3.38).\nThis property indicates that one disposes of different ways to deal with 4d partitions\neither the simplest one using 3d-partitions or the more refined on involving 2d partitions.\nBelow we consider both representations.\nNotice moreover that given a 4d partition P, we can associate to it various kinds\nof transpose partitions. Using the particular realization eq(3.36), the corresponding\ntransposes read as\n\u03bbT \u2297 \u03bc \u2297 \u03bd,\n\n\u03bb \u2297 \u03bcT \u2297 \u03bd,\n\n\u03bbT \u2297 \u03bcT \u2297 \u03bd,\n\n\u03bb \u2297 \u03bcT \u2297 \u03bd T ,\n\nT\n\n\u03bb \u2297 \u03bcT \u2297 \u03bd T ,\n\n\u03bb \u2297 \u03bc \u2297 \u03bd T,\n\n\u03bbT \u2297 \u03bc \u2297 \u03bd T ,\n\n(3.43)\n\nwhere \u03bbT stands for the usual transpose of the Young diagram \u03bb.\nThe exact mathematical definitions and the full properties of 4d partitions are not our\nimmediate objective here; they need by themselves a separate study. Here above we have\ngiven just the needed properties to set up the structure of the 4-vertex formalism and\nits restricted non planar 3-vertex method.\n3.3.2\n\nTetra- vertex C(4) and ZX4\n\n\u03b1) the 4- vertex C(4)\nThe 4- vertex C(4) of the toric Calabi-Yau X4 can be built by extending the 3-vertex\nconstruction eq(2.3).\nIn the 3d partition set up, the vertex C(4) has four external legs L\u039b , L\u03a3 , L\u03a5 , L\u0393 with\nboundary conditions as in eq(3.37). The 4-vertex C(4) with boundary conditions (\u039b\u03a3\u03a5\u0393)\ncan be defined as a function of the Bolzmann weight q = e\u2212\u03b2 as follows:\nC\u039b\u03a3\u03a5\u0393 \u2261 C\u039b\u03a3\u03a5\u0393 (q) .\n\n(3.44)\n\nIn the case where \u039b = \u03a3 = \u03a5 = \u0393 = \u2205, the corresponding 4- vertex C\u2205\u2205\u2205\u2205 should be\nequal to the generating function ZC4 of the 4d generalized Young diagrams\nC\u2205\u2205\u2205\u2205 = ZC4 .\nRecall that the generating functional ZC4 can be defined as a power series like,\nX\nq |P| ,\nZ C4 =\n\n(3.45)\n\n(3.46)\n\n4d partitions P\n\nwhere |P| is the number of hypercubes in P.\nIn the generic case, C\u039b\u03a3\u03a5\u0393 should be given by the generalization5 of the 3-vertex (2.4)\n5\n\nthe partition function ZC 3 can be also defined as the generating function of 3d partitions [30].\n\n17\n\n\fand could a priori be expressed in terms of the product of some hypothetic generalized\nSchur functions S\u039b (q).\nIn the 2d partition set up, one can C(4) in quite similar manner. Using eqs(3.37-3.39),\nwe can generally define it as in eq(3.21). This is a kind of rank 12 object\nC(abc)(def)(ghi)(jkl) ,\n\n(3.47)\n\ndepending on the Boltzmann weight and the boundary conditions (external momenta)\na, ..., l.\nTo obtain its explicit expression, we use the following\n(i) the relation between the 4-vertex and composites of planar 3-vertices.\n(ii) the results on the usual 3-vertex formalism.\nThe first property follows by noting that 4-vertices of the toric web-diagram of X4 with\nthe special Lagrangian fibration\nR4 \u00d7 R \u00d7 T 3 ,\n(3.48)\ncorresponds to the intersection of the planar 3-vertices of three triangles. To fix the\nideas, consider figure 5 and focus on the point A representing a 4-vertex of the toric\nweb-diagram of X4 . The point A is the intersection\nA = \u22061 \u2229 \u22062 \u2229 \u22063 ,\n\n(3.49)\n\nof the triangles,\n\u22061 =\n\ntriangle ABC,\n\n\u22062 =\n\ntriangle ABD,\n\n\u22063 =\n\ntriangle ACD,\n\n(3.50)\n\nThese triangles are boundary faces of the tetrahedron\nABCD.\n\n(3.51)\n\nInside of the tetrahedron, the toric fiber is\nT 3 = S1 \u00d7 S1 \u00d7 S1 .\n\n(3.52)\n\nOn each triangle face, a circle shrinks leaving T 2 .\nOn each egde of a triangle, one more circle shrinks leaving S1 .\nAt the vertex A, all 1-cycles of T 3 shrinks down to zero.\nThe property captured by eqs(3.49) means that we may relate the 4-vertex C\u039b\u03a3\u03a5\u0393 to\nthree planar vertices of the triangles (3.50). This can be done by expressing the 3d\n18\n\n\fpartitions (\u039b, \u03a3, \u03a5, \u0393) in terms of 2d partitions (a, b, c) , (d, e, f) , (g, h, i) and (j, k, l) as\nfollows\n\u03a3 = (b, c, \u2205) ,\n\n\u039b = (a, d, g) ,\n\u03a5 = (e, \u2205, f) ,\n\n\u0393 = (\u2205, h, i) .\n\n(3.53)\n\nThe decomposition (3.53) is illustrated on the formal figure 8 where the three triangles\nare represented in different colors.\n\n3\nFigure 8: A typical 4-vertex in O (\u22123 \u2212 m) \u2192 W P1,1,1,m\nusing 2d partitions.

This model is useful for the purpose of this paper.\nWe also use this field realization to fix convention notations and to introduce some\nmathematical objects and their physical interpretations.\n21\n\n\fThe local P2 model is nicely formulated in the language of 4D, N = 1 supersymmetry\nwhich is, roughly, equivalent to the usual 2D, N = 2 supersymmetry. The complex two\ndimension projective plane P2 has one Kahler parameter t, interpreted as the FayetIliopoulos (FI) coupling constant in the supersymmetric gauge theory.\nThe U (1) gauged linear sigma theory describing the local P2 target space geometry\ninvolves the following 4D, N = 1 superfields (supersymmetric representations):\n\u0001\n(1) A U (1) gauge superfield V = V x, \u03b8, \u03b8 which reads, in the Wess-Zumino gauge, as\nfollows:\n1 2\n2\nV = \u2212\u03b8\u03c3 \u03bc \u03b8A\u03bc \u2212 i\u03b8 \u03b8\u03bb + i\u03b82 \u03b8\u03bb + \u03b82 \u03b8 D,\n(4.1)\n2\n\u0001\nwhere x\u03bc , \u03b8a , \u03b8\u0227 stands for the 4D, N = 1 superspace coordinates.\n\u0001\nIn this relation, A\u03bc (x) and \u03bba (x) , \u03bb\u0227 (x) are respectively the U (1) gauge vector and\ngaugino fields.\nThe scalar field D is the usual auxiliary field capturing the local Calabi-Yau geometry.\nIt captures as well as part of the scalar field potential V of the gauge theory\nV = D2 +\n\nX\ni\n\n|Fi |2 ,\n\n(4.2)\n\nwhere the Fi terms will be introduced below.\n(2) Four chiral superfields {\u03a60 , \u03a61 , \u03a62 , \u03a63 }, with \u03b8-expansion\n\u03a6i = zi + \u03b8\u03c8 i + \u03b8 2 Fi ,\n\n(4.3)\n\nwith zi being the field coordinates of local P2 , \u03c8 i the Weyl spinors and Fi the so called\nF-auxiliary fields.\nThe \u03a6i complex superfields carry the following qi - charges under the U (1) gauge symmetry,\n(q0 , q1 , q2 , q3 ) = (\u22123, 1, 1, 1) .\n(4.4)\nThe qi 's add exactly to zero as required by the Calabi-Yau condition\n3\nX\n\nqi = 0,\n\n(4.5)\n\ni=0\n\nof local P2 .\nThe superfield Lagrangian density Llocal P 2 = L (\u03a6, V ) of the local P2 model reads, in\nthe N = 1 D = 4 formalism, as follows,\nL (\u03a6, V ) =\n\nZ\n\n4\n\nd\u03b8\n\n3\nX\ni=0\n\n2qi V\n\n\u03a6i e\n\n\u03a6i \u2212 2t\n\n22\n\nZ\n\nd4 \u03b8V + Lgauge (V ) .\n\n(4.6)\n\n\fHere Lgauge (V ) is the superspace Lagrangian density for the U (1) vector multiplet that\ncan be found in [47].\nThe equation of motion of the auxiliary field D leads to,\n|z1 |2 + |z2 |2 + |z3 |2 \u2212 3 |z0 |2 = t.\n\n(4.7)\n\nIt is nothing but the defining equation of the local projective plane O (\u22123) \u2192 P2 .\nThe compact part P2 of this threefold is a complex plane given by the divisor z0 = 0;\nit is parameterized by the complex coordinates (z1 , z2 , z3 ) describing a complex surface\nembedded in C3 and has a U (1) gauge symmetry rotating the phases of the coordinates\nvariables.\nBy setting xi = |zi |2 , the complex surface z0 = 0 can be represented by the planar\ntriangle [48],\nx1 + x2 + x3 = t\n(4.8)\nwith Kahler modulus t; see also figure 1.\nBecause of the symmetry under permutation of the xi 's, the triangle is equilateral.

They will be interpreted as the field equation of motion of the auxiliary D- field in\nsupersymmetric sigma model.\nThe third relation, which is covariant under U (1) gauge symmetry, is an extra complex\ncondition implemented in order to restrict P2 geometry to its toric boundary \u2202P2 . It will\nbe interpreted later as the equation of motion of the auxiliary F- fields.\nNotice that, the implementation of the boundary condition is a new feature. It can be\nthen viewed as:\n(i) a generalization of the usual approach for dealing with sigma model realization of\ntoric manifolds.\n(ii) a way to approach genus g Riemann surfaces.\n(iii) a method that can be used to describe the toric boundary of more general complex\nn dimensional toric Calabi-Yau manifolds. We will make a comment regarding this point\nin the conclusion section.\nNotice finally that for t 6= 0 the three complex variables cannot vanish simultaneously,\ni.e\n(z1 , z2 , z3 ) 6= (0, 0, 0)\n(5.9)\nIn the particular case t = 0, the geometry collapses to the origin (0, 0, 0) where live a P2\nsingularity and an elliptic one.\n5.1.3\n\nDivisor O (\u22123) \u2192 E (t,\u221e)\n\nUsing the above result on the toric realization of the elliptic curve, one can immediately write down the defining equation of the divisor O (\u22123) \u2192 E (t,\u221e) of the local P2 .\n25\n\n\fWe have\n\n\uf8f1\n2\n2\n2\n2\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2 |z1 | + |z2 | + |z3 | \u2212 3 |z0 | = t\nzi \u2261 zi eiqi \u03b1 ,\ni = 0, 1, 2, 3,\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\nz1 z2 z3 = 0,\n\n(5.10)\n\nwhere (q0 , q1 , q2 , q3 ) are as in eq(4.4) and where the complex variable z0 parameterizes\nthe non compact direction O (\u22123).\nIf we do not worry about the Calabi-Yau condition, the first relation can be extended as\n|z1 |2 + |z2 |2 + |z3 |2 \u2212 m |z0 |2 = t.\n\n(5.11)\n\nwhere m is an arbitrary positive integer.\n\n5.2\n\nSuperfield action\n\nHere we give the supersymmetric field description of (5.11). We start by studying\nthe field realization of the toric curve E (t,\u221e) . Then we consider its extension to the local\ngeometry.\n5.2.1\n\nGauge invariant model for the elliptic curve\n\nTo build the supersymmetric model describing the toric curve E (t,\u221e) , we start from\nthe superfield content eq(4.7) of local P2 theory and implement the constraint equation\n(5.10) by using Lagrange multiplier method together U (1) gauge invariance.\nThe appropriate Lagrange superfield multiplier is given by a chiral superfield \u03a5 with\ncharge q\u03a5 = \u22123 under U (1) gauge symmetry so that the chiral superfield monomial\nW (\u03a6, \u03a5) = \u03a61 \u03a62 \u03a63 \u03a5,\n\n(5.12)\n\nis gauge invariant. Thus the supersymmetric Lagrangian super-density with target space\nE (t,\u221e) is given by the density,\n\u0012 Z\n\u0013\n2\n(5.13)\nLE = LP 2 + g d \u03b8W (\u03a6, \u03a5) + hc ,\nwhere g is a complex coupling constant. Since \u03a5 has no kinetic term, its elimination\nthrough the equation of motion\n\u03b4LE\n=0\n(5.14)\n\u03b4\u03a5\ngives\ng\u03a61 \u03a62 \u03a63 = 0,\n(5.15)\nwhose lowest term is precisely z1 z2 z3 = 0.\nNotice that contrary to P2 , the superfield realization of the curve E (t,\u221e) has a non trivial\n26\n\n\fchiral superpotential. As we see, this result is a particular situation that can be extended\nto build toric realization of other toric manifolds.\nNotice also that the Lagrange superfield multiplier \u03a5 can be given a geometric interpretation. This superfield has no kinetic term \u03a5\u03a5 nor couplings to the gauge superfield V ;\ni.e no term type\nZ\nd4 \u03b8\u03a5e2qV \u03a5,\n\n(5.16)\n\nin the Lagrangian super-density. The lack of (5.16) can be interpreted as corresponding\nto freezing the supersymmetric gauge invariant dynamics of \u03a5. This property explains\nwhy the Calabi-Yau condition for the complex toric curve E (t,\u221e) should read as,\n3\nX\n\nqi + q\u03b3 =\n\ni=1\n\n3\nX\ni=1\n\nqi \u2212 3 = 0.\n\n(5.17)\n\nWe will turn to this property when we consider the local threefold O (m) \u2295 O (\u2212m) \u2192\nE (t,\u221e) .\nNotice also that the chiral superpotential (5.12) is not the unique gauge invariant term\none may have. The general form of W (\u03a6, \u03a5) is given by\nX\nW (\u03a6, \u03a5) =\ngn1 ,n2 ,n3 \u03a6n1 1 \u03a6n2 2 \u03a6n3 3 .\n(5.18)\nn1 +n2 +n3 =3\n\nWe will discuss this point in section 5 when we study the generalization to higher dimension CY manifolds.\nFor the moment, let us complete this discussion by giving the gauged superfield realization of the complex surface O (\u2212m) \u2192 E (t,\u221e) .\n5.2.2\n\nField model for the Divisor O (\u2212m) \u2192 E (t,\u221e)\n\nIn addition to the U (1) gauge superfield V , this model involves five chiral superfields\n(\u03a60 , \u03a61 , \u03a62 , \u03a63 , \u03a5) with charges\n(q0 , q1 , q2 , q3 , q\u03b3 ) = (\u2212m, 1, 1, 1, \u22123) .\nThe Lagrangian super-density Ldivisor is given by,\nLdivisor =\n\nZ\n\n4\n\nd\u03b8\n\n3\nX\n\n2qi V\n\n\u03a6i e\n\n\u03a6i + Lgauge (V ) \u2212 2t\n\n\u0012 Zi=0\n\u0013\n2\n+ g d \u03b8W (\u03a6, \u03a5) + hc\n\n27\n\n(5.19)\n\nZ\n\nd4 \u03b8V\n(5.20)\n\n\fwhere the chiral superpotential W (\u03a6, \u03a5) is as in eq(5.12). Here also the first Chern class\nof the complex surface has a contribution coming from \u03a5 and reads as\n3\nX\ni=0\n\nqi + q\u03b3 = \u2212m\n\n(5.21)\n\nshowing, as expected, that O (\u2212m) \u2192 E (t,\u221e) is not a Calabi-Yau surface.\n\n5.3\n\nModuli space of supersymmetric vacuum\n\nHere we study the supersymmetric vacuum of the field model (5.20). We show that\nthe surface (5.10) corresponds to a particular vacuum given by the vev z\u03b3 = 0.\nModuli space of vacua\nIn the supersymmetric vacuum, the vanishing condition of the scalar potential V = V (z)\nof the model (5.13) reads as\n|D|2 + |F0 |2 + |F1 |2 + |F2 |2 + |F3 |2 + |F\u03b3 |2 = 0.\n\n(5.22)\n\nThe dependence of the scalar potential V in the scalar fields z is obtained by replacing\nthe auxiliary fields D and Fi by their explicit expressions in terms of the matter fields\nD\nFi\n\n= D (z0 , z1 , z2 , z3 , z\u03b3 ) ,\n= Fi (z0 , z1 , z2 , z3 , z\u03b3 ) .\n\n(5.23)\n\nThese expressions are obtained by using the equations of motion\n\u03b4L\n= 0,\n\u03b4D\n\n\u03b4L\n= 0.\n\u03b4F i\n\n(5.24)\n\nFi = 0.\n\n(5.25)\n\nEq(5.22) is solved as follows,\nD = 0,\nAs noted before, D = 0 leads to\n|z1 |2 + |z2 |2 + |z3 |2 \u2212 m |z0 |2 = t\n\n(5.26)\n\nand describes local P2 for the particular case m = 3.\nFi = 0 involves five terms: F0 which is trivial, and the remaining F\u03b3 , F3 , F2 , and F1 lead\nto:\nz1 z2 z3 = 0,\nz1 z2 z\u03b3 = 0,\nz3 z1 z\u03b3 = 0,\nz2 z3 z\u03b3 = 0,\n28\n\n(5.27)\n\n\fwhere z\u03b3 stands for the lowest component field of the chiral superfield \u03a5. There are\nseveral solutions of these relations. These solutions may be classified into two sets:\n(1) the first set is given by\nz\u03b3 = 0.\n(5.28)\nConsequently eqs(5.27) reduce to the first equation z1 z2 z3 = 0.\nThe moduli background associated with this solution describes exactly the complex surface O (\u22123) \u2192 E (t,\u221e) .\n(2) the second set corresponds to\nz\u03b3 6= 0\n(5.29)\nand two variables amongst the three z1 , z2 and z3 vanish.\nSo eqs(5.26) become\n|z1 |2 \u2212 m |z0 |2 = t,\n\nz2 = z3 = 0 :\n\n|z2 |2 \u2212 m |z0 |2 = t,\n\nz1 = z3 = 0 :\n\n(5.30)\n\n|z3 |2 \u2212 m |z0 |2 = t.\n\nz1 = z2 = 0 :\n\nCase z\u03b3 = 0\nLet us now consider the interesting case z\u03b3 = 0 and study the solution of constraint eq\nz1 z2 z3 = 0. Here also there are several solutions which we list below:\n(1) case z3 = 0 but (z1 , z2 ) 6= (0, 0) :\nIn this case the geometry reduces to\n|z1 |2 + |z2 |2 \u2212 3 |z0 |2 = t.\n\n(5.31)\n\nIt describes the local complex projective line\nO (\u22123) \u2192 P1 ,\n\n(5.32)\n\nwhich we denote as O (\u22123) \u2192 P13 where the sub-index 3 on P13 refers to z3 = 0.\nThe same thing is valid for z1 = 0 and z2 = 0.\nThey describe respectively the local surfaces O (\u22123) \u2192 P11 and O (\u22123) \u2192 P12 .\n\u221a\n(2) case z1 = 0, z2 = 0, z3 = t\nThis solution describes one of the three possible vertices of O (\u22123) \u2192 E (t,\u221e) ; the two\nother vertices are associated with the points:\n\u221a\n(i) z1 = 0, z2 = t, z3 = 0 and,\n\u221a\n(ii) z1 = t, z2 = 0, z3 = 0.\n(3) case z1 = z2 = z3 = 0 is a P2 singularity.\nThis solution corresponds to the limit t = 0 where both E (t,\u221e) and so P2 collapse down\nto a point.\n29\n\n\fThe above analysis can be viewed as an interesting step towards the study of topological vertex of local genus g- Riemann surfaces (in particular g = 1) by using toric\ndiagrams based on the curve E (t,\u221e) . To that purpose, one first has to build the toric\nrealization of basic objects of the topological vertex method. For instance, the complex\ncoordinates associated with the vertices of the elliptic curve E (t,\u221e) are given by the local\npatches\n(1)\n\nz1 ,\n\n(1)\n\nz2 ,\n\n(1)\n\nz3 = 0,\n\n(2)\n\nz1 ,\n\n(2)\n\nz3 ,\n\n(2)\n\nz2 = 0,\n\n(3)\n\nz2 ,\n\n(3)\n\nz3 ,\n\n(3)\n\nz1 = 0.\n\nU1 : z0 ,\n\nU2 : z0 ,\n\nU3 : z0 ,\n\n(1)\n\n(2)\n\n(5.33)\n\n(3)\n\n(i)\n\nThe upper index of zj refers to the corresponding chart Ui . Note that on each chart,\nwe have the relation\n(i) (i) (i)\nz1 z2 z3 = 0,\ni = 1, 2, 3\n(5.34)\nThe patches Ui could be interpreted as the three \"toric pants\" needed for building E (t,\u221e)\nand may be related to the topological pant considered in [30]. By gluing these three\npatches, one reproduces E (t,\u221e) .\n\n6\n\nLocal 2-torus\n\nThe local complex surface X2 = O (\u2212m) \u2192 E (t,\u221e) we have considered so far is not\na Calabi-Yau 2-fold. The first Chern class c1 (T \u2217 X2 ) of this variety is equal to \u2212m. For\nour concern, this surface is thought of as a divisor of the local Calabi-Yau threefold,\nO (m) \u2295 O (\u2212m) \u2192 E (t,\u221e) .\n\n6.1\n\n(6.1)\n\nField model\n\nThe supersymmetric field model relations describing the toric Calabi-Yau threefold\n(6.1) can be easily derived from previous study. They are given by the following system\nof component field equations,\n(\n|z1 |2 + |z2 |2 + |z3 |2 + 3 |z4 |2 \u2212 3 |z0 |2 = t,\n(6.2)\nz1 z2 z3 = 0.\nHere z0 and z4 parameterize the non compact directions and (z1 , z2 , z3 ) are as before.\nThe toric graph of this local threefold is shown on figure (12); it has three tetra-valent\nvertices,\n\n30\n\n\fFigure 12: Toric graph of O (\u22123) \u2192E (t,\u221e) . The compact part is E (t,\u221e) =(\u2202P2 ) with the usual\nthree vertices. Its toric frontier consists of three intersecting P1 's in the homology class of\n2-torus . (a) Figure (on left) represents real skeleton. (b) Figure (on right) gives its fattening.\n\nTo get the superfield Lagrangian density LlocT 2 , we think about eqs(6.2) as the field\nequations of motion of the D and Fi auxiliary fields.\nThe first relation is associated with\n\nwhile the second follows from,\n\n\u03b4LlocE\n= 0,\n\u03b4D\n\n(6.3)\n\n\u03b4LlocE\n= 0.\n\u03b4Fi\n\n(6.4)\n\nThe result is\nLlocE =\n\nZ\n\n4\n\nd\u03b8\n\n3\nX\n\n2V\n\n\u03a6i e \u03a6i +\n\ni=1\n\n+Lgauge (V ) \u2212 2t\n\nZ\n\nZ\n\nd4 \u03b8 \u03a60 e\u22122mV \u03a60 + \u03a64 e2mV \u03a64\n\n\u0001\n\n\u0012 Z\n\u0013\n2\nd \u03b8V + g d \u03b8\u03a61 \u03a62 \u03a63 \u03a5 + hc ,\n4\n\n(6.5)\n\nwhere \u03a5 is a Lagrange superfield multiplier capturing the constraint restricting the field\nvariables to the boundary of P2 .\nIn addition to the U (1) gauge multiplet V , the chiral superfields of this model are\n(\u03a60 , \u03a61 , \u03a62 , \u03a64 , \u03a65 , \u03a5)\n\n(6.6)\n\nand carry the following qi - charges under the U (1) gauge symmetry,\n(q0 , q1 , q2 , q3 , q4 , q\u03b3 ) = (\u2212m, 1, 1, 1, m, \u22123) .\nwhere m is a priori equal to 3; but in general can take any integral value.\n31\n\n(6.7)\n\n\f6.2\n\nGeneralization\n\nThe construction we have developed here above can be generalized to other CalabiYau manifolds. Below we make a comment on two kinds of generalizations. The first\nextension deals with the gauged sigma model realization of local genus g-Riemann surfaces for g \u2265 2. The second generalization concerns sigma model approach for higher\ncomplex dimensional compact toric Calabi-Yau manifolds.\n6.2.1\n\nLocal genus g-Riemann surfaces\n\nSo far we have seen that for each local elliptic curve, it is associated a U (1) gauge\nsymmetry. This gauge symmetry is inherited from the P2 model. Since local genus gRiemann surfaces can be engineered by gluing several local elliptic curves, we conclude\nthat a class of local genus g-Riemann surfaces could be described by higher rank abelian\nU n (1) gauged supersymmetric field model type. The rank n of the gauge symmetry\ndepends on the way the gluing is done.\nTo illustrate the idea, let us give the example of g = 2- Riemann surface described by a\n2D U 2 (1) gauged N = 2 supersymmetric sigma model.\nThe local g = 2- Riemann surface in the large complex structures limits can be engineered\n(t,\u221e)\n(t,\u221e)\nby gluing two local elliptic curves with compact base E1\n= \u2202P21 and E2\n= \u2202P22 . In\nthe sigma model approach, we distinguish different representations according to whether\nP21 and P22 have an intersection point or edge.\nIn the first case, the sigma model involves five complex field variables,\n(z1 , z2 , z3 , z4 , z5 )\n\n(6.8)\n\nand a U 2 (1) gauge invariance under which these complex variables have the following\ngauge charges\nqi1\n\n\u0001\n\n\u0001\n2\n\nqi\n\n= (1, 1, 1, 0, 0)\n= (0, 0, 1, 1, 1)\n\n(6.9)\n\nThe field theoretic equations describing the compact part of the moduli space of supersymmetric vacua are given by,\n(\n(\n|z3 |2 + |z4 |2 + |z5 |2 = t2\n|z1 |2 + |z2 |2 + |z3 |2 = t1\n,\n(6.10)\n,\nz3 z4 z5 = 0\nz1 z2 z3 = 0\nwhere t1 and t2 are respectively the Kahler moduli of the projective planes P21 and P22 .\nThe holomorphic constraint eqs z1 z2 z3 = 0 and z3 z4 z5 = 0 are implemented in the gauged\nsupersymmetric superfield model by two chiral superfields \u03a51 and \u03a52 with gauge charges\n32\n\n\f\u0001\nq\u03b31 , q\u03b32 equal to (\u22123, 0) and (0, \u22123) respectively.\nNotice that eq(6.10) describes indeed a complex curve with genus g = 2. The toric\nthreefold based on this genus g = 2 curve is parameterized by seven complex variables,\n(z0 , z1 , z2 , z3 , z4 , z5 , z6 ) ,\n\n(6.11)\n\nwith gauge charges as\nqi1\n\n\u0001\n\n\u0001\n2\n\nqi\n\n= (\u22123, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, \u22123) ,\n\n= (\u22123, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, \u22123) .\n\n(6.12)\n\nThe gauged supersymmetric field theoretical equation\n\u2212 m |z0 |2 + |z1 |2 + |z2 |2 + |z3 |2 + m |z6 |2 = t1 ,\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n\u2212n |z0 | + |z3 | + |z4 | + |z5 | + n |z6 |\n\n2\n\n= t2 ,\n\nz1 z2 z3 = 0,\nz3 z4 z5 = 0,\n\n(6.13)\n\nwhere m and n are in general arbitrary integers; but can be set equal to 3 to keep in\ntouch with the first Chern class of the complex two dimensional projective plane.\nThese relations involve seven complex variables constrained by four complex constraint\neqs leaving then three complex variables free. Note also that the first relation of the\n(t,\u221e)\nabove equation describes O (m) \u2295 O (\u2212m) \u2192 E1\nwhile the second describes O (n) \u2295\n(t,\u221e)\nO (\u2212n) \u2192 E2 .\n6.2.2\n\nHigher dimensional toric CY manifolds\n\nThe gauged supersymmetric sigma model for the boundary surface of local P2 that\nwe have considered in this paper can be extended for compact divisors of local Pn\u22121 .

To describe the compact (divisor)\nboundary \u2202 (Pn\u22121 ) of the toric n-fold, we supplement the hypersurface equation by the\nfollowing extra gauge covariant constraint relation,\nn\nY\n\nzi = 0.\n\ni=1\n\n33\n\n(6.16)\n\n\fExtending the analysis of section 4, the U (1) gauged supersymmetric sigma model describing \u2202 (Pn\u22121 ) reads as follows\n\u0012 Z\n\u0013\n2\n(6.17)\nL\u2202P n\u22121 = LP n\u22121 + g d \u03b8W (\u03a6, \u03a5) + hc\nwith chiral superpotential\nW (\u03a6, \u03a5) = \u03a5\n\nn\nY\n\n\u03a6i .\n\n(6.18)\n\ni=1\n\nThe gauge charge q\u03b3 of the Lagrange multiplier superfield \u03a5 is equal to (\u2212n). Here also\nthe first Chern class of \u2202 (Pn\u22121 ) is identically zero. As noted before, this property is\nnot a new feature since the most general gauge invariant chiral superpotential extending\neq(6.18) is given by\n!\nn\nX\nY\nmi\ng{mi } \u03a5\n\u03a6i\n(6.19)\nW (\u03a6, \u03a5) =\nm1 +...+mn =n\n\ni=1\n\nwhere g{mi } are complex coupling constants.\nThe equation of motion of \u03a5 gives a degree n homogeneous polynom describing a complex\n(n \u2212 2) dimension holomorphic CY hypersurface with complex structures g{mi } .\n\n7\n\nConclusion\n\nIn this paper, we have set up the basis of the non planar topological 3-vertex method\nto compute the topological string amplitudes for the family of local elliptic curves\nO(m) \u2295 O(\u2212m)\n\n\u2192 E (t,\u03bc)\n\n,\n\nm\u2208Z\n\n,\n\n(7.1)\n\nin the limit of large complex structure \u03bc; i.e\n|\u03bc| \u2192 \u221e\n\n.\n\n(7.2)\n\nGenerally speaking, the base E (t,\u03bc) stands for an elliptic curve with Kahler parameter t\nand complex structure \u03bc embedded in the projective plane P2 . In the large limit \u03bc; the\ncorresponding elliptic curve E (t,\u221e) is realized as the toric boundary of P2 ; see appendix\nfor more details; in particular eqs(8.5,8.12,8.17).\nFirst, we have reviewed the main idea of the usual (planar) topological 3-vertex method\nfor non compact toric threefolds.\nThen, we have drawn the first lines of the non planar topological 3-vertex method for the\nlocal degenerate 2-torus. The latter is a non compact toric Calabi-Yau threefold given\nby a hypersurface in a complex Kahler 4-fold.\n34\n\n\fThe key idea in getting the particular toric representation of the local 2-torus with large\ncomplex structure is based on thinking about E (t,\u221e) as given by the toric boundary of\nthe complex projective plane P2 . In this view, O(m) \u2295 O(\u2212m) \u2192 E (t,\u221e) becomes a\ntoric threefold and so one may extend the results of the topological 3- vertex method of\n[28] to the case of the local (degenerate) 2-torus. Obviously, to compute the topological\namplitudes, we have to use the non planar 3-vertex method rather than the usual planar\n3-vertex one. Regarding this matter, we have given first results concerning the local\ndegenerate elliptic curve O(m) \u2295 O(\u2212m) \u2192 E (t,\u221e) . More analysis is however still needed\nbefore getting the complete explicit results.\nWe have also developed the gauged supersymmetric sigma model realization that\nunderlies the geometry the local 2-torus with |\u03bc| \u2212\u2192 \u221e and exhibited explicitly the role\nof D- and F- terms. We have discussed as well how this construction could be extended\nto local genus g-Riemann surfaces O(m) \u2295 O(2 \u2212 2g \u2212 m) \u2192 \u03a3g in the limit of large\ncomplex structures.\nThe results obtained in the field theory part of the paper may also be viewed as an\nexplicit analysis regarding implementation of F- terms in the Witten's original work on\nphases of N = 2 supersymmetric theories in two dimensions [47].\nAcknowledgement 1 The authors thank the International Centre for Theoretical Physics,\nand S.

The boundary \u2202 (P2 ) is a\ntoric submanifold with fibration\n\u2202 (P2 )\n\n= \u22061 \u00d7 S1\n\n,\n\n(8.3)\n\nwhere \u22061 = (\u2202B2 ) is the boundary of a triangle.\nClearly, thought not exactly the standard 2- torus S1 \u00d7 S1 , the boundary \u2202 (P2 ) has\nsomething to do with it. It is the large complex structure \u03bc of the elliptic curve E (t,\u03bc) ;\nsay\n(8.4)\n|\u03bc| \u2212\u2192 +\u221e .\nAs we need both Kahler and complex structures to answer the question (8.1), let us first\ngive some useful details and then turn to derive the identity \u2202 (P2t ) \u2243 E (t,\u221e) .\nProjective plane P2\nThere are different ways to deal the complex projective plane P2 . Below, we give two\ndual descriptions by using the so called type IIA and type IIB geometries [51].\nType IIA geometry\nIn this set up, known also as toric geometry, the projective plane P2 is defined by the\nfollowing real 4 dimensional compact hypersurface in C3 ,\n|z1 |2 + |z2 |2 + |z3 |2 = t,\n\n(8.5)\n\nwhere (z1 , z2 , z3 ) stand for local complex coordinates. In the above relation, the complex\nvariables obey the gauge identifications\nzk\u2032\n\n\u2261 ei\u03c6 zk\n\n,\n\n(8.6)\n\nwhere the real phase \u03c6 is the parameter of the U (1) gauge symmetry. The phase \u03c6 can\nbe used to fix one of the three phases of the zk = |zk | ei\u03c6k complex coordinates leaving\nthen two free phases; say \u03c61 and \u03c62 . These free phases are precisely the ones used to\nparameterize the 2-torus in the fibration (8.2).\nThe positive parameter t is the Kahler modulus of the projective plane; it controls the\nsize of P2 . Indeed, in the singular limit t \u2212\u2192 0, we have the two following:\n(i) the size of the complex surface P2 vanishes\n\u0002\n\u0001\u0003\nlim vol P2 = 0,\n(8.7)\nt\u2212\u21920\n\nin agreement with both the relation vol (P2 ) \u223c t2 (footnote 7 ) and eq(8.5) which becomes\nthen singular.\n(ii) the size of the complex boundary \u2202 (P2 ) vanishes as well\n\u0002 \u0002\n\u0001\u0003\u0003\nlim vol \u2202 P2\n= 0,\n(8.8)\nt\u2212\u21920\n\n36\n\n\fThe two above relations show that the Kahler parameter t of P2 and the Kahler parameter\nr of it boundary \u2202 (P2 ) are intimately related. We will show later that they are the same7 .\nNotice in passing that in the field theory language, the relation (8.5) has an interpretation\nas the field equation of motion of the D- auxiliary field in the U (1) gauged sigma model\nrealization of P2 . There, the Kahler parameter t is interpreted as the Fayet-Iliopoulos\ncoupling constant term. This description is well known; some of its basic aspects have\nbeen studied in section 4 of this the paper; we will then omit redundant details.\nType IIB geometry:\nIn the type IIB geometry, one thinks about the complex projective surface P2 as a\ncomplex holomorphic algebraic surface obtained by taking the coset of the complex space\nC3 \\ {(0, 0, 0)} by the complex abelian group C\u2217 ;\n\u0002\n\u0003\nP2 = C3 \\ {(0, 0, 0)} /C\u2217 .\n(8.9)\n\nThe C\u2217 group action allows to make the following identifications,\n(z1 , z2 , z3 ) \u2261 (\u03bbz1 , \u03bbz2 , \u03bbz3 )\n\n(8.10)\n\nwith \u03bb being an arbitrary non zero complex number. This identification reduces the\ncomplex 3- dimension down to complex 2 dimensions. Here also, one can make gauge\nchoices by working in a particular local coordinate patch. A standard gauge choice is\nthe one given by the condition \u03bbz3 = 1.\nComplex curves in P2\nComplex curves ( real Riemann surfaces) in P2 are complex codimension one submanifolds obtained by imposing one more complex constraint relation f (zi ) = 0 on the\nprojective complex variables z1 , z2 and z3 . The most common curves in P2 are obviously\nthe projective lines P1 , conics and elliptic curves.\nGenerally speaking, the constraint eq f (zi ) = 0 can be stated as follows,\nf (\u03bbz1 , \u03bbz2 , \u03bbz3 ) = \u03bbn f (z1 , z2 , z3 ) = 0,\n\n(8.11)\n\nwhere n stands for the degree of homogeneity of the curve. The case n = 3, is given by\nthe following typical cubic\nz13 + z23 + z33 + \u03bcz1 z2 z3 = 0.\n\n(8.12)\n\nThis relation describes an elliptic curve E of degree 3 with a complex structure \u03bc. This\ncurve E has been extensively used in physical literature; in particular in the geometric\n7\n\nFrom eq(8.5), it is not difficult to see that the volume of P2 is proportional to t2 while the volume\n\u0001\nof its boundary \u2202 P2 is proportional t.\n\n37\n\n\fengineering of 4D superconformal field theories embedded in 10D type IIB superstring\non elliptically fibered Calabi-Yau threefolds [51, 52].\nBefore proceeding further, it is interesting to notice that the elliptic curve E is a genus\none Riemann surface having a real 3d moduli space; parameterized by\n(\u03bc1 , \u03bc2 ; r)\n\n(8.13)\n\nwith \u03bc = \u03bc1 + i\u03bc2 is the complex structure and r is its Kahler modulus. So, elliptic\ncurves may be generally denoted as follows\nE (r,\u03bc) .\n\n(8.14)\n\nRegarding the complex parameter \u03bc of the elliptic curve E (r,\u03bc) , it is explicitly exhibited\nin type IIB geometry set up as shown on eq(8.12).\nHowever, it is interesting to notice that the Kahler parameter r cannot be exhibited\nexplicitly since E (r,\u03bc) has no standard type IIA geometry realisation8 of the type given\nby eq(8.5).\nThe construction developed in this paper gives a way to circumvent this difficulty by\nusing the degenerate representation (8.3).\nWith the above features in mind, we turn now to the derivation of eq(8.1).\n\u2202 (P2 ) as the degenerate elliptic curve E (r,\u221e)\nHere we would like to show that \u2202 (P2 ) is E (r,\u03bc) but with a large complex structure \u03bc;\nthat is |\u03bc| \u2212\u2192 \u221e.\nTo get the key point behind the identity (8.1) as well as the degeneracy of the elliptic\ncurve E (r,\u03bc) , we give the two following properties:\n(a) the projective plane P2 has three particular intersecting divisors Di . These are\nassociated with the hyperlines\nzi = 0\n(8.15)\nin P2 which, up on using eq(8.5), lead to the following relations\nD1\nD2\nD3\n\n:\n:\n:\n\n|z2 |2 + |z3 |2\n|z1 |2 + |z3 |2\n|z1 |2 + |z2 |2\n\n=\n=\n=\n\nt ,\nt ,\nt .\n\n(8.16)\n\nFrom these equations, we see that each divisor Di is a projective line with Kahler parameter t.\nThe equality of the Kahler parameters t1 = t2 = t3 = t of these projective lines may be\n8\n\nIn toric geometry the real base of the fibration Bn \u00d7 Tn of complex n- dimensional toric manifolds\ninvolves projective lines. Torii appear rather in the fiber.\n\n38\n\n\falso interpreted as due to the permutation symmetry of the {zi } projective coordinate\nvariables of P2 . This feature translates, in the language of toric geometry, as corresponding to having an equilateral triangle for the real base B2 .\n(b) The divisors {Di } are precisely the ones we get by taking the large complex structure\nlimit (8.4) of the complex curve eq(8.12). Under this condition, eq(8.12) reduces then to\nthe dominant monomial\n\u03bcz1 z2 z3 = 0.\n(8.17)\nNotice that the above relation is obviously invariant under the C\u2217 transformations (8.10)\nsince\n\u03bc (\u03bbz1 ) (\u03bbz2 ) (\u03bbz3 ) = \u03bb3 (\u03bcz1 z2 z3 ) = 0.\n(8.18)\nTo have more insight about the elliptic curve E (t,\u221e) with large complex structure; |\u03bc| \u2212\u2192\n\u221e, it is interesting to solve eq(8.17). There are three solutions classified as follows:\n(i) z1 = 0, what ever the two other complex variables z2 and z3 are; provided that\n(z2 , z3 )\n(z2 , z3 )\n\n6= (0, 0)\n\u2261 (\u03bbz2 , \u03bbz3 )\n\n,\n.\n\n(8.19)\n\nBut these relations are nothing but the definition of the divisor D1 in type IIB geometry.\n(ii) z2 = 0, what ever the other complex variables z1 and z3 are; provided that\n(z1 , z3 )\n(z1 , z3 )\n\n6= (0, 0)\n\u2261 (\u03bbz1 , \u03bbz3 )\n\n,\n,\n\n(8.20)\n\ndescribing then the divisor D2 .\n(iii) z3 = 0, what ever the other complex variables z2 and z1 are; provided that\n(z1 , z2 )\n(z1 , z2 )\n\n6= (0, 0)\n\u2261 (\u03bbz1 , \u03bbz2 )\n\n,\n,\n\n(8.21)\n\nassociated with the divisor D3 .\nTo conclude the boundary (\u2202P2t ) of the projective plane P2t is indeed described by an\nelliptic curve with a Kahler parameter t inherited from the P2t one; but with a large\ncomplex structure \u03bc; see also footnote 7. The limit \u03bc \u2192 \u221e explains the degeneracy\nproperty in the base \u22061 (8.3).\n\nReferences\n[1] Marcos Marino, Chern-Simons Theory and Topological Strings, Rev.Mod.Phys. 77\n(2005) 675-720, arXiv:hep-th/0406005\n39\n\n\f[2] R.
