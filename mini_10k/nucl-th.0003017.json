Proposed initially as a\nfull-fledged renormalizable quantum field theory, nowadays it is seen as an\neffective field theory, derivable, in principle, from the quantum chromodynamics [2].\nThe relativistic mean field theory (RMFT), which can be thought as a\nmean field (Hartree) approximation to the QHD, has been applied with great\nsuccess during the last few decades. For instance, it accounts for both i) the\nnuclear matter saturation, and ii) the ground state properties of finite nuclei\nalong the whole periodic table [3]. More recently, the RMFT has also been\nexploited for the description of unstable nuclei all up to the nucleon drip\nlines [4].\nThrough a relativistic version of the random phase approximation (RRPA),\nvarious excited states and resonances have been studied in the context of the\nRMFT [5]\u2013[9] as well. Quite recently we have also reported [10] the first calculation of this type for the Gamow-Teller (GT) and isobaric analogue (IA)\nresonances, excited from the ground states of 48 Ca, 90 Zr and 208 Pb nuclei.\nBecause of its pseudoscalar nature, the pion does not participate in the\ndescription of the the ground states in the RMFT. Thus, besides the nucleon\nand the Coulomb fields, only the \u03c3, \u03c9 and \u03c1 mesons are usually involved in\nthe calculations. Yet, in dealing with isovector excitations it is essential to\ninclude, together with the \u03c1 meson, the \u03c0 meson as well. This has already\nbeen done in our previous work [10], with the pseudovector pion-nucleon\ncoupling f\u03c0 fixed at its experimental value. For the remaining mesons, only\nthe nonderivative couplings to the nucleon were included, as usually done in\nRMFT. With this prescription we were not able to reproduce the excitation\nenergies of the just mentioned resonances. This has been possible only after\nintroducing the repulsive Landau-Migdal (LM) delta force\nVLM (1, 2) = g\n\n\u2032\n\nf\u03c0\nm\u03c0\n\n!2\n\n\u03c4 1 * \u03c4 2 \u03c3 1 * \u03c3 2 \u03b4(r1 \u2212 r2 ),\n\n(1)\n\nof the same magnitude (g \u2032 = 0.7) as the one used in the nonrelativistic\ncalculations [11].\nHere we wish to analyze whether the tensor (derivative) coupling of the \u03c1\nmeson to the nucleon could generate a sufficiently repulsive nucleon-nucleon\nforce in order to locate the GT resonance at the correct experimental energy\n2\n\n\fand in this way substitute the phenomenological LM force. The IA resonance\nis practically not affected by this part of the \u03c1-meson-exchange potential and\ntherefore it will not be discussed so exhaustively as we do with the GT\nresonance.\nAs mentioned above, it is not usual to include the tensor coupling of the\nvector mesons to the nucleon in RMFT. This is because its effect on the\nground state is (rightly) thought to be small. On a more general perspective,\nhowever, there are two good reasons why one should do so. For one, according\nto the rules of effective field theory such terms should appear in the effective\nQHD Lagrangian [12]. For another, and perhaps more important reason for\nthe phenomenological stand we are taking, it is well known that the tensor \u03c1nucleon coupling gives a large contribution to the spin-isospin component of\nthe nucleon-nucleon interaction [13], and as such it could have an important\neffect on the dynamics of the GT resonance.\nOur Lagrangian density is now\nL = \u03c8\u0304(i\u03b3\u03bc \u2202 \u03bc \u2212 M)\u03c8\n1\n1\n1\n1\n+ \u2202\u03bc \u03c3\u2202 \u03bc \u03c3 \u2212 m\u03c3 2 \u03c3 2 \u2212 g2 \u03c3 3 \u2212 g3 \u03c3 4 \u2212 g\u03c3 \u03c8\u0304\u03c8\u03c3\n2\n2\n3\n4\n1\n1\n\u2212 \u03a9\u03bc\u03bd \u03a9\u03bc\u03bd + m\u03c9 2 \u03c9\u03bc \u03c9 \u03bc \u2212 g\u03c9 \u03c8\u0304\u03b3\u03bc \u03c8\u03c9 \u03bc\n4\n2\n1\nf\u03c0\n1\n\u03c8\u0304\u03b35 \u03b3\u03bc \u03c4 \u03c8 * \u2202 \u03bc \u03c0\n+ \u2202\u03bc \u03c0 * \u2202 \u03bc \u03c0 \u2212 m\u03c0 2 \u03c0 * \u03c0 \u2212\n2\n2\nm\u03c0\n1\n1\n\u2212 R\u03bc\u03bd * R\u03bc\u03bd + m\u03c1 2 \u03c1\u03bc * \u03c1\u03bc \u2212 g\u03c1 \u03c8\u0304\u03b3\u03bc \u03c4 \u03c8 * \u03c1\u03bc\n4\n2\nf\u03c1\n\u03c8\u0304\u03c3\u03bc\u03bd \u03c4 \u03c8 * \u2202 \u03bc \u03c1\u03bd\n\u2212\n2M\n1\n1 + \u03c43\n\u2212 F\u03bc\u03bd F \u03bc\u03bd \u2212 e\u03c8\u0304\u03b3\u03bc\n\u03c8A\u03bc ,\n4\n2\n\n(2)\n\nwhere\n\u03a9\u03bc\u03bd = \u2202 \u03bc \u03c9 \u03bd \u2212 \u2202 \u03bd \u03c9 \u03bc ,\nR\u03bc\u03bd = \u2202 \u03bc \u03c1\u03bd \u2212 \u2202 \u03bd \u03c1\u03bc \u2212 2g\u03c1 \u03c1\u03bc \u00d7 \u03c1\u03bd ,\nF \u03bc\u03bd = \u2202 \u03bc A\u03bd \u2212 \u2202 \u03bd A\u03bc .\n\n(3)\n\nThis Lagrangian is identical to that of reference [10], except for the \u03c1-nucleon\n3\n\n\ftensor coupling term (the one proportional to f\u03c1 ).1 Therefore, following\nthe same route one arrives at identical equations for the mean boson fields,\nexcept for that of the \u03c1 meson (only the component \u03c103 survives for spherical,\ndefinite-charge nuclei), which now takes the form\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\n\u2212\u22072 + m\u03c1 2 \u03c103 = g\u03c1 \u03c13 (r) +\n\nf\u03c1\n\u2207 * \u03c1t3 (r),\n2M\n\n(4)\n\nwhere the (vector) isovector density \u03c13 is as defined in [10] and we have\nintroduced the tensor isovector density\nD\n\nE\n\n\u03c1t3 = \u03c8\u0304i\u03b1\u03c43 \u03c8 =\n\nA\nX\n\n\u016a\u03b1 i\u03b1\u03c43 U\u03b1 .\n\n(5)\n\n\u03b1=1\n\nThe summation is over all the occupied single-particle, positive-energy states\nU\u03b1 , which obey the mean-field Dirac equation.

An alternative, more detailed account can be found in [14]. The main\ningredient is the residual interaction V . For a self-consistent calculation,\nthis must be obtained from the same Lagrangian (1) used for the mean field.\nAlso, since Fock terms are ignored in RMFT, we must consider only the direct\nmatrix elements of V . Hence only the isovector mesons contribute, and we\nget V = V\u03c0 + V\u03c1 , with, in the instantaneous approximation,\nf\u03c0\nV\u03c0 (1, 2) = \u2212\nm\u03c0\n\n!2\n\n\u03c4 1 * \u03c4 2 (\u03c3 1 * \u22071 \u03c3 2 * \u22072 )Y (m\u03c0 , r12 ),\n\n(8)\n\n1\nThere is a minor correction to be made in [10].

Yet, in view of the\ndifficulties encountered by Ma et al. [9] in accounting for the E1 and E0\ngiant resonances with the NL1 parameters, a few results for the TM1 model,\nworked out by Sugahara and Toki [16], will be presented as well.2 Taking\nexperimental values for the pion, the only new parameter is the \u03c1-nucleon\ntensor coupling constant f\u03c1 . As mentioned in [17], the vector dominance\nmodel predicts for the ratio f\u03c1 /g\u03c1 \u2261 K\u03c1 a value equal to the isovector magnetic moment of the nucleon, i.e., \u03bcp \u2212 \u03bcn \u2212 1 = 3.7. On the other hand,\nmost meson-exchange models for the nuclear force use K\u03c1 = 6.6 [13]. The\nformer choice was preferred in the description of the ground state properties\nin closed shell nuclei within the relativistic Hartree-Fock approximation [17].\nThus, the discussion that follows will mainly rely on the lower value for K\u03c1 ,\neven though we are aware of the fact that the inclusion of Fock terms can\nconsiderably change the adjusted values of the QHD parameters [17].\nAnother point to consider is whether the inclusion of the tensor coupling\nterm in the Lagrangian (2) does not sensitively affect the values of the remaining parameters. Fortunately, while the contribution of this term is not\nstrictly zero in RMFT, its effects on the single particle energies as well as on\nthe ground state properties are certainly very small. We therefore feel justified in keeping the remaining parameters fixed at their NL1 or TM1 values.\nWith K\u03c1 = 3.7, for instance, the spin-orbit splitting is modified in less than\n150 KeV. 3 Similarly tiny effects on the energy per particle and the rootmean-square radii are displayed in Table 1. An interesting side remark can\n2\n\nIn the latter case, the \u03c9-meson self-interaction term, not appearing in (2), was also\nincluded in the numerical calculations.\n3\nFor identical particles, the NL1 paramerization yields significantly larger spin-orbit\nsplittings than the TM1 model, while the opposite happens for nonidentical particles.\n\n5\n\n\fbe made concerning the latter observables. It is well known that, at variance\nwith the nonrelativistic calculations, it is a common feature of the relativistic\nmodels to overestimate the neutron skin thickness [16, 23]. But, as seen from\nthe results shown in Table 1, the tensor \u03c1-N coupling has the tendency to\ncorrect the RMFT for this handicap. This fact, in turn, could have very important consequences on the estimates of the atomic parity nonconservation\n[24, 25].\nThe GT and IA resonances in 208 Pb were computed in RRPA, for both\nthe NL1 and TM1 sets of parameters and within the same model space as\nthat of [10], i.e., including only 0h\u0304\u03a9 and 2h\u0304\u03a9 excitations, and only those\nsingle-particle states that are bound at least for neutrons. For simplicity,\nwe ignored the negative-energy states, although it has been shown [8] that\nthey are required in principle even if the no-sea approximation is made for\nRMFT, since one needs a complete single-particle basis to develop a perfectly\nconsistent RRPA. In fact, the transitions from Fermi- to Dirac-sea states are\nessential to ensure certain desirable features, such as current conservation\nand the removal of the spurious J \u03c0 = 1\u2212 translational state. However, such\nissues are not crucial for our present purposes and, furthermore, Ma et al.\nhave shown in a recent calculation [26] that the contribution of the negativeenergy states is of decisive importance only for the isoscalar modes. We\ntherefore feel safe to leave their inclusion for a future, more sophisticated\nand detailed treatment of those isovector resonances.\nIn Fig. 1 are shown the NL1 results for the GT strength distribution,\nboth in terms of the individual strengths,\n2\n\ns\u03bb =\n\nX\n\n\u03bb\nXpn\u0304\nhp||\u03c3||n\u0304i\n\n+\n\nX\n\n\u03bb\nYnp\u0304\nhp\u0304||\u03c3||ni\n\n,\n\n(10)\n\nnp\u0304\n\npn\u0304\n\nand of a \"strength function\" obtained by replacing the spikes by Lorentzians\nof conveniently chosen widths \u2206 [10], i.e.,\nS(E) =\n\n\u2206X\ns\u03bb\n,\n\u03c0 \u03bb (E \u2212 E\u03bb )2 + \u22062\n\n(11)\n\n\u03bb\n\u03bb\nwhere Xpn\u0304\nand Ynp\u0304\nare, respectively, the forward and backward going RPA\namplitudes for the state at excitation-energy E\u03bb . The upper, middle and\nlower panels correspond, respectively, to: (a) K\u03c1 = 0, g \u2032 = 0; (b) K\u03c1 =\n\n6\n\n\f3.7, g \u2032 = 0 and (c) K\u03c1 = 3.7, g \u2032 = 0.7. From these results one is induced to\nconclude that the tensor \u03c1-N coupling has a very small effect on the GT resonance. That is, it seems as though this coupling could merely redistribute\nthe GT strength in the energy region between 5 and 15 MeV, but was incapable of promoting it to the correct experimental energy. The latter is only\nachieved after introducing an LM force of the same magnitude that has been\nused in the previous calculation, where the just mentioned coupling has not\nbeen considered at all [10]. The issue of the NN-force generated by the \u03c1-N\ncoupling is, however, not so simple and deserves further discussion, which is\npresented below. Before proceeding, let us just mention that we have not\nnoticed large differences between the NL1 and TM1 results for the IA and\nGT resonances. For instance, in the case (c) we get that these excitations\nare localized at: EIA (NL1) = 18.6 MeV and EGT (NL1) = 19.5 MeV and\nEIA (TM1) = 18.7 MeV and EGT (TM1) = 20.3 MeV, while the experimental results are: EIA (exp) = 18.8 MeV and EGT (exp) = 19.2 MeV. Thus,\nhenceforth only the parametrization NL1 will be used.\nIn the upper panel of Fig. 2 are confronted several diagonal J \u03c0 = 1+\nproton-particle neutron-hole matrix elements for the VLM , V\u03c0 , V\u03c1V V , V\u03c1V T\nand V\u03c1T T potentials. (The meaning of the upper indices is self-explanatory.)\nOne can see, in particular, that the matrix elements of V\u03c1T T are very small\nin comparison with those coming from VLM . However, when we rewrite V\u03c1T T\nin the form\nV\u03c1T T (1, 2)\n\n=\n\nf\u03c1\n2M\n\n!2\n\n\u03c4 1 * \u03c4 2 \u03b21 \u03b22 {\u2212(\u03b1 * \u2207)1 (\u03b1 * \u2207)2 Y (m\u03c1 , r12 )\n!\n\n1 2\n3\n3\n\u2212\nm\u03c1\n+\n+ 1 Y (m\u03c1 , r12 )S12\n2\n2\n3\nm\u03c1 r12 m\u03c1 r12\n\u001b\ni\n2h 2\nm\u03c1 Y (m\u03c1 , r12 ) \u2212 \u03b4(r 1 \u2212 r 2 ) \u03c3 1 * \u03c3 2\n+\n3\n\n(12)\n\nand evaluate different parts separately, we find out that the Yukawa and\ncontact pieces in the last term engender, each one, very large matrix elements. In fact, as shown in the lower panel, their individual values are larger\nthan those of VLM , but the overall contribution to V\u03c1T T is small, because\nthey cancel each other very strongly. (A similar cancelation, though not so\npronounced, also occurs in the case of V\u03c0 .)\nIt should be remembered that the contact terms in V\u03c0 and V\u03c1T T would be\n7\n\n\fsmeared over a finite region if finite-nucleon-size effects (FNSE) were introduced, and they would be totally killed by realistic short range correlations\n(SRC). 4 Yet, none of these two effects is considered in a mean field treatment,\nsuch as the present one. In return, it is common practice [5, 17] to extract\nthe contact parts from (8) and (9) by adding to the residual interaction the\ncorrection term \u03b4V = \u03b4V\u03c0 + \u03b4V\u03c1 , with\n!2\n\n1\n\u03b4V\u03c0 (1, 2) =\n3\n\nf\u03c0\nm\u03c0\n\n1\n\u03b4V\u03c1 (1, 2) =\n3\n\nf\u03c1\n2M\n\n\u03c4 1 * \u03c4 2 \u03c3 1 * \u03c3 2 \u03b4(r 1 \u2212 r 2 ),\n\n!2\n\n\u03c4 1 * \u03c4 2 \u03b21 \u03b22 (\u03b11 * \u03b12 + 2\u03c3 1 * \u03c3 2 ) \u03b4(r 1 \u2212 r 2 ).\n(13)\n\nFor consistency, one must also perform such an extraction in the mean field\npart. Since, differently from the Hamiltonian formalism followed in [17],\nwe are working within a Lagrangian formalism, we did this extraction in\nthe baryon self-energy computed in the Hartree approximation (which is\nequivalent to RMFT). As a consequence the replacement Vt \u2192 Vt + \u03b4Vt has\nto be done in the Dirac equation (6), with\n1\n\u03b4Vt =\n3\n\nf\u03c1\n2M\n\n!2\n\n\u03c1t3 * r\n\u03c43\nr\n\n(14)\n\nbeing a correction that arises upon the extraction from the baryon self-energy\nof the contact part due to this derivative coupling in eq. (2). But, when this\nrecipe is implemented in the numerical calculation we get too much repulsion\nand the GT resonance is pushed up very high in energy. This comes from\nthe fact that \u03b4V is basically a \u03b4-force of the type (1), with\n\u2032\ng\u03c0+\u03c1\n\n1 2\n\u223c\n= +\n3 3\n\nf\u03c1\nf\u03c0\n\n!2 \u0012\n\nm\u03c0\n2M\n\n\u00132\n\n= 1.6,\n\n(15)\n\nwhich is significantly larger than g \u2032 = 0.7.\n4\n\nNote, however, that the contributions of the contact terms are nonzero when, both\nthe FNSE, and the SRC are considered simultaneously [27].\n\n8\n\n\fNote that in the nonrelativistic approximation the contact term also appears in V\u03c1V V and V\u03c1V T , and instead of (15) one would have\n\u2032\ng\u03c0+\u03c1\n\n1 2\n\u223c\n= +\n3 3\n\ng\u03c1 + f\u03c1\nf\u03c0\n\n!2 \u0012\n\nm\u03c0\n2M\n\n\u00132\n\n= 2.3.\n\n(16)\n\nThere is no consensus on whether one should proceed in the same way in the\nrelativistic case. Some authors exclude the contact terms only from V\u03c0 and\nV\u03c1T T [17], while others do that for the full \u03c0 + \u03c1 interaction [5, 28]. That\nthe potentials V\u03c1V V and V\u03c1V T also contain a contact term follows from the\nsubstitution [29]\n1\n\u03b3\u03bc \u2194\n(2P\u03bc + \u03c3\u03bc\u03bd \u2202 \u03bd )\n(17)\n2M\nfor the vector \u03c1-N coupling.\nIt is worth noting that Toki and Weise [30] have interpreted microscopically the LM force as arising from the \u03c0 + \u03c1 meson-exchange model combined\nwith the SRC and FNSE. In the static limit, which is used here, the result\nis [31]:\n\n\u2032\ngLM\n(\u03c9\n\n1\n= q = 0) \u223c\n=\n3\n2\n+\n3\n\n\u039b2 \u2212 m2\u03c0\n\u039b2 + m20\ng\u03c1 + f\u03c1\nf\u03c0\n\n!2\n\n!2 \u0012\n\nm20\nm20 + m2\u03c0\nm\u03c0\n2M\n\n\u00132\n\nm20\n,\nm20 + m2\u03c1\n\n(18)\n\nwhere \u039b is the cut-off mass for the pion-nucleon vertex and m\u22121\n0 is the correlation length. For \u039b = 1 GeV, m0 = m\u03c1 and g\u03c1 + f\u03c1 = 17.2 this leads to\n\u2032\ngLM\n(\u03c9 = q = 0) = 0.67 [31]. (In the present work g\u03c1 + f\u03c1 = 23.4.)\nOur results can be summarized as follows:\n1. When the short range correlations are not considered, the tensor \u03c1nucleon coupling plays only a minor role in the description of the GT\nresonances.\n2. If one tries to take these correlations into account by merely extracting\nthe contact terms from the NN interaction, the GT resonance is pushed\nup too high in energy.\n9\n\n\fThus, the simulation of the short range correlations by the simple-minded\nextraction of the contact terms alone is not a satisfactory procedure; at least\nnot in the case of the heavier mesons. The explanation is that the contact\nterms in the \u03c0+\u03c1 NN-interaction are not the only ones to be strongly modified\nby the short range correlations. In particular, because of the large \u03c1-meson\nmass, also the Yukawa terms generated in (9) should be strongly reduced.\nWe conclude hence that the implementation of, both realistic short range\ncorrelations, and finite-nucleon-size effects, in the context of the relativistic\nRPA, is required. Presently, we are working on this issue.\nFinally, let us mention that the tensor \u03c1-nucleon coupling plays an important role in the transverse spin response, and that some progress in assessing\nthis through a relativistic many-body calculation has been made quite recently by Yoshida and Toki [32].\nThe authors wish to thank Peter Ring for the use of his spherical RMFT\ncode, and one of us (F.K.) also thanks him for discussions and warm hospitality at the Technischen Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen.
