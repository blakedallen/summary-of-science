Understanding this process could help in the search\nfor the quantum theory underlying gravity, and suggest new schemes for preserving\nthe coherence of technological quantum devices.\nThe process of decoherence is best understood in terms of information flow\nwithin a quantum system, and between the system and its environment. We develop\na novel way of characterizing this information, and give a sufficient condition for\nits classicality. These results generalize previous models of decoherence, clarify the\nprocess by which a phase-space based on non-commutative quantum variables can\nemerge, and provide a possible explanation for the universality of the phenomenon\nof decoherence. In addition, the tools developed in this approach generalize the\ntheory of quantum error correction to infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces.\nWe characterize the nature of the information preserved by a quantum channel by the observables which exist in its image (in the Heisenberg picture). The\nsharp observables preserved by a channel form an operator algebra which can be\ncharacterized in terms of the channel's elements. The effect of the channel on these\nobservables can be reversed by another physical transformation. These results generalize the theory of quantum error correction to codes characterized by arbitrary\nvon Neumann algebras, which can represent hybrid quantum-classical information,\ncontinuous variable systems, or certain quantum field theories.\nThe preserved unsharp observables (positive operator-valued measures) allow for\na finer characterization of the information preserved by a channel. We show that the\nonly type of information which can be duplicated arbitrarily many times consists\nof coarse-grainings of a single POVM. Based on these results, we propose a model\nof decoherence which can account for the emergence of a realistic classical phasespace. This model supports the view that the quantum-classical correspondence\nis given by a quantum-to-classical channel, which is another way of representing a\nPOVM.\n\niii\n\n\fAcknowledgements\nI would like to thank my supervisors Achim Kempf and David Kribs for their\nhelp and guidance, as well as my office mates David Campo, William Donnelly,\nSasha Gutfraind, Yufang Hao, Rob Martin and Angus Prain for countless discussions and exchange of ideas.

This understanding is not perfect and fails to account for\ncertain cosmological and astronomical observations. In addition, there are purely\nlogical reasons to want to modify general relativity or the standard model. For\ninstance, we do not have a reasonable idea of how the gravitational field, which\nis modeled classically, should interact with quantum fields. Since all of matter is\nmodeled at the fundamental level by quantum fields, this represents a large hole in\nour understanding of nature. Experiments are of little help because gravitational\neffects are extremely weak in the regimes where the quantum nature of fields can\nbe probed.\nIt is usually assumed on logical grounds that the first necessary step toward\na consistent picture of all fundamental interactions would be to replace general\nrelativity by a quantum theory of gravity. The problem of quantum gravity can be\nsummarized as the search for a quantum theory which has general relativity as a\nclassical limit.\nThere do exist several empirical methods to find a \"quantum version\" of a classical theory-a process called quantization-but these methods do not guarantee\nthat the quantum theory obtained will have the classical theory we started from\nas a classical limit. Instead, quantization methods are most often used as a tool\nto describe a quantum theory using some form of classical intuition, even if the\nclassical model involved does not relate to any macroscopic phenomenon.\nIn fact, there is no reason to expect that there exists a well-defined mathematical\nprocedure which would directly yield a quantum theory starting from its classical\nlimit. It is the opposite process-namely the derivation of the effective classical\nlimit of a given quantum theory in a given context-which ought to be completely\nunderstood.\nGiven that, surprisingly, very little is known about the subject, we may hypothesize that the problem of deriving the classical limit of a quantum theory has\n1\n\n\f2\n\nIntroduction\n\nnever been considered of prime importance in the past. Indeed, there is no real\nneed to be certain that a given quantum theory has the right limit when plenty\nof experiments are directly testing the candidate quantum theory itself. This may\nexplain the usual acceptance of the traditional quantization prescriptions: it does\nnot matter how the quantum theory was arrived at, as long as experiments say it\nis correct.\nHowever, quantization must be taken more seriously in the context of quantum\ngravity, since the classical limit is the only prediction that we can use to refute any\nparticular model.\nIn this thesis we will study the problem of understanding how a quantum system\nbecomes, or appears, classical. We will do so by generalizing certain results of\nquantum information processing. Some of these results were published in References\n[1, 2, 3]. Our results on decoherence also appeared in Reference [4].\n\n1.1\n\nInformation, channels and classicality\n\nBefore we explain in more details the problems that we want to solve, let us clarify\nour use of certain terms which can intuitively have various meanings.\nIn Section 2.1 we will define precisely what we mean by quantum and classical\nphysical models. This terminology is uncontroversial because we only use the adjectives quantum and classical to qualify a model and not a physical system itself.\nFor instance the same system could be described with a quantum as well as a classical model. Later in the text we will be less pedantic and simply say \"classical\nsystem\" as a shorthand for \"system modeled classically\". If we say that physical\nsystems are fundamentally quantum, we mean that at the microscopic level they\nare best described by a quantum model. Our goal will be to understand how the\nclassical systems that we are familiar with are related to the underlying quantum\ndescription of the same physics. Of course, one could find a contrived classical\nmodel which is as complete as the quantum description (say Bohm's theory), however, even disregarding the multitude of intrinsic problems associated with such a\ntheory, one would still have to explain how to derive observed classical phenomena\nas a limiting case. This is not the path that we are going to follow. We will in\nfact obtain reasonable conditions under which an effective classical model emerges\nwhich is related to the underlying quantum model in a non-contextual way (see\nSection 5.3).\nA communication channel, or channel for short, will be understood as the most\ngeneral way that the state of a system B can be conditioned on that of a system\nA. If A and B are both quantum or both classical, this corresponds to the usual\nnotion of a quantum channel (Section 2.1.4) or classical channel (a stochastic map)\nrespectively.\nWe will use the word \"information\" essentially as a synonym of \"correlation\".\nHence two different systems will always be involved in a sentence containing this\n\n\fThe emergence of classicality\n\n3\n\nword. For instance we could say that a system B contains information about a\nsystem A. If we possess a joint state for A and B, this would mean that some\nobservable of A is correlated with some observable of B. More importantly, in the\ncontext where the state of B is a function of the state of A, i.e. if they are related\nby a channel, we will say that B contains information about A if, by performing\na measurement on B, we learn something also about A. More precisely, we will\ncharacterize the information that B possesses about A by checking exactly which\nproperty (which observable) we indirectly measure on A when performing a given\nmeasurement on B. This is the concept that we will analyze in Chapter 3.\nThis qualitative information can be quantified in certain contexts using generalizations of Shannon's theory (as for instance in Section 2.1.3). However, we will\nbe more interested in certain discrete aspects of the structure of this information,\nespecially whether or not it is classical (Section 5.3).\n\n1.2\n\nThe emergence of classicality\n\nIt is widely believed that everything in nature is fundamentally quantum. Hence\nwe need to explain why, and how, most of it actually appears classical in a wide\nrange of situations. At first glance, the answer may seem obvious: things appear\nclassical when we do not measure their behaviour accurately enough (compared to\n~) to detect their quantumness. The main problem with this answer is that it does\nnot tell us specifically which observable of the quantum system is being measured\nwhen such an \"inaccurate\" observation is performed. Indeed, we know that there\nare many fundamentally incompatible ways of observing a quantum system. Each\nway to do it is labeled by an observable. By contrast, there is a single best way to\nobserve a classical system: it suffices to measure its precise state. Everything else\ncan be deduced from it. We will therefore focus on the following question:\nQuestion 1.1. Which quantum observable is being measured in the complete observation of a classical system?\nThis way of formulating the question of the classical limit is not standard, and,\nalthough it is rather natural, it requires some detailed explanations, which are the\nsubject of Section 5.1.\nThe first thing to note, which might be a source of confusion for the reader, is\nthat there is no need to assume that an observable only takes a single real number\nas its value. Although this assumption is rather innocent for a classical system,\nwhere a non-scalar observable can usually be seen a the joint observation of several\nscalar observables, it would be a strong conceptual limitation in the context of\nquantum mechanics where, as we know, observables cannot in general be measured\njointly. This point is to be made in order to make it clear that measuring the state\nof a classical system amounts to observing one very special observable, namely the\n\n\f4\n\nIntroduction\n\nobservable which gives full information about the classical system. Indeed the statespace of a classical system (i.e. its phase-space) is rarely one-dimensional. Since\nany observation of a quantum system is specified by an observable, and since every\nclassical system is a quantum system in disguise, this phase-space observation must\nactually correspond to the observation of a single quantum observable. Hence, our\nquestion: which quantum observable defines this classical system?\nIn order to provide a realistic answer to this question we will need to consider the\nmost general notion of an observable, which is provided by the formalism of PositiveOperator Valued Measures (POVM). For instance, we know that, in general, the\nvarious variables which parameterize a classical phase-space correspond to noncommuting quantum observables. This implies that the quantum description of\nphase-space must require some approximate joint measurement of non-commuting\nobservables, something which is readily characterized by a POVM. Hence we will\nmake extensive use of this notion, although we will specialize it slightly for technical\nand conceptual reasons (see Chapter 2).\nLet us remark that there is another important related question, which we will\nnot address here. A system can behave classically, not with respect to any observation, but indirectly through the way that it interacts with an auxiliary quantum\nsystem. We are familiar with the description of a quantum system, say an electron,\ninteracting with a system which is assumed classical, for instance the scalar potential of the electromagnetic field. We know that the electromagnetic field is in fact\nquantum, therefore we must understand why it can be treated classically when we\nare concerned with the behaviour of that electron. This example involves no act\nof measurement, and is pertinent to the state of our knowledge of the interaction\nbetween quantum fields and gravity, where gravity plays the role of the classical\nelectromagnetic field.\n\n1.3\n\nDecoherence\n\nAny definition of a quantum measurement refers, explicitly or implicitly, to an interaction between the quantum system and a postulated external classical system\n(the observer). Note that the standard framework of quantum mechanics will be\nrecovered explicitly in this way in Chapter 2. However, a quantum system interacting with other quantum systems can also undergo at least part of the phenomenon\nof collapse associated with a traditional axiomatic measurement. This is the experimentally ubiquitous process of decoherence characterized, in its simpler form,\nby an evolution of the form\nX\n\u03c1 7\u2192\n|iihi|\u03c1|iihi|.\n(1.1)\ni\n\nfor some basis |ii, indexed by the integer i.\nBased on this phenomenon, the theory of decoherence [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11] provides an answer to Question 1.1. The premise is that nothing really important\n\n\fDecoherence\n\n5\n\nhappens during the act of observation itself. At the classical level, an observation\nonly involves gathering information which is already present in the environment.\nThe idea is that a system which appears classical is never isolated from the rest\nof the world-the relevant part of which we call the environment. Uncontrolled\ninteractions constantly spread information about the state of the system into the\nenvironment. It is this process itself which selects which observable of the system\nthe environment contains information about. The conscious act of observation then\nsimply amounts to the observer becoming aware of this information. For instance,\nany macroscopic object constantly bounces into, or emits, photons. Simply gathering a few of these photons certainly has no consequence on the system, but may\nyield information about the position of the object at the time of the interaction\nwith the photons.\nBy contrast, what makes an act of observation quantum is the observer's ability\nto choose the nature of the interaction between his measurement apparatus and\nthe quantum system, so as to decide which observable will be measured. Hence, for\na system to appear classical, two conditions must be fulfilled: It must be continuously \"monitored\" by its environment, and the observer must learn about it only\nindirectly through the information which is already contained in the environment.\nAlthough the theory of decoherence has been used to tackle the infamous measurement problem related to the interpretation of quantum mechanics, we are here\ninterested only in its ability to answer Question 1.1, i.e. to tell us which observable\nof a quantum system defines its classical limit in a given context.\nLet us briefly summarize this theory here. In elementary presentations of decoherence [8], one considers an open quantum evolution which essentially removes\nthe off-diagonal elements of the density matrix \u03c1 representing a quantum state, as\nexpressed in Equation 1.1. The basis involved in this expression is selected by the\ndynamical process itself. Indeed, the initial states of the form \u03c1 = |iihi| are the only\nstates which stay pure throughout the interaction. They are called pointer states.\nIn addition, if this process results from a unitary interaction with an auxiliary\nquantum system, the joint final state of the two systems must be of the form\nX\nU (|\u03c8i \u2297 |0i) =\nhi|\u03c8i|ii \u2297 |\u03c6i i\ni\n\nwhere |\u03c8i is the initial state of the system, |0i the initial state of the auxiliary\nsystem (the environment), |\u03c6i i some orthonormal basis of the auxiliary system,\nand U the unitary operator specifying the joint evolution for some interval of time.\nSuch a process has been initially studied by von Neumann [12] as an example of\nhow a measurement apparatus can be modeled by a quantum system. Here the\nmeasurement apparatus is the auxiliary system, or environment. This process represents a measurement of the system by the environment in the sense that a further\nmeasurement (now in the axiomatic sense) of the environment in the basis |\u03c6i i effectively simulates a measurement of an observable of the system with eigenstates\n|ii. Indeed, this measurement yields the outcome labelled by i with probability\n\n\f6\n\nIntroduction\n\n|hi|\u03c8i|2 . The state collapses to |ii \u2297 |\u03c8i i, which reduces to |ii when we neglect the\nenvironment. The observable being measured is fixed only up to its eigenvalues,\nbecause we are only interested in the probabilities\nP that it defines. In general we\nwill simply consider a fiducial observable A = i \u03bbi |iihi| for some distinct set of\neigenvalues \u03bbi which only act as labels for the eigenvectors. We will say that the\nobservable A is the pointer observable.\nThis is an example of a purely unitary (and hence purely quantum) process\nwhich selects a particular observable of the system, as specified by the orthogonal\nbasis |ii, and transfers the information about this observable to the environment.\nNote that the evolution of the system alone is such that any quantum superposition between the states |ii is replaced by aPsimple statistical mixture. Indeed\nif the initial state is \u03c1 = |\u03c8ih\u03c8| where |\u03c8i = i \u03b1i |ii, then the final state of the\nsystem is\nX\nX\n|iihi|\u03c1|iihi| =\n|\u03b1i |2 |iihi|.\n(1.2)\ni\n\ni\n\nAlthough this model introduces some essential ideas, it is too simplistic to be\napplied to realistic systems. Its main problem is that it can only explain the\nselection of sharp observables, i.e. traditional observables, and not POVMs, which,\nas we will argue in more detail in Section 5.1, are needed for an understanding of the\nclassical limit of the most common physical systems. In addition, this model does\nnot explain why classicality is universal at macroscopic scales, since processes of the\nabove kind are rather special. Finally, in this model, the effective classical system\nrepresented by the pointer observable does not have any non-trivial dynamics.\nThese points have all been addressed before (see for instance [8, 9], or the review\nsection in [13]). Most of these approaches consider a single non-relativistic particle\ncoupled via its position operator to a thermal bath of harmonic oscillators. One\noften assumes a Markovian approximation, which allows for the dynamics of the\nsystem to be represented by a differential equation in time. This is important\nas it removes the need for an explicit solution of the dynamics. In this picture,\ndecoherence is always expected to take place in the position basis, due to the local\nnature of the interaction. Although such analyzes have shed important light on\nmany aspects of decoherence, they have important limitations. For instance, they\nprovide unsatisfactory, or limited answers to the following general questions. If the\ndecoherence takes place in the position basis, what mechanism guarantees the-\nseemingly contradictory-preservation of momentum information? What singles\nout momentum as the other phase-space variable? How would we recognize an\ninteraction which yields the emergence of a non-canonical phase-space structure?\nDoes this process justify one quantization process over another? How is this loss\nof information in the system related to a gain of information in the environement,\ni.e. a measurement? Can some quantum information be preserved in the system\ndespite the process of decoherence?\nInstead of attempting to improve on these models, we will adopt a new approach\nwhich generalizes in a different way the simple model that we first described. We\n\n\fDecoherence\n\n7\n\nwill make no specific physical assumption. Instead we will show that the process of\ndecoherence can be understood at a very fundamental level, in terms of information\nflow between the system and its environment.\nWe can easily generalize von Neumann's analysis of the process of measurement\nand note that any interaction between a quantum system and another quantum\nsystem-the environment-yields correlations which are such that a subsequent\nmeasurement of a particular observable of the environment exactly simulates a\nmeasurement of some observable of the system. The observable of the system\nwhich is indirectly measured is selected by the nature of the interaction between\nthe two systems. Mathematically, if the initial state of the system is \u03c1 and that\nof the environment |0i, and the interaction is specified by the unitary operator U ,\nthen the final states of the two system is U (\u03c1 \u2297 |0ih0|)U \u2020 . A measurement of a fixed\nobservable with eigenstates |ii on the environment after the interaction yields the\nprobabilities\npi = Tr((1 \u2297 |iihi|) U (\u03c1 \u2297 |0ih0|) U \u2020 )\n= Tr(U \u2020 (1 \u2297 |iihi|) U (\u03c1 \u2297 |0ih0|))\n= Tr((1 \u2297 h0|) U \u2020 (1 \u2297 |iihi|) U (1 \u2297 |0i)\u03c1)\n= Tr(Ai \u03c1).\nwhere we have only used the cyclicity of the trace, and defined the operators\nAi := (1 \u2297 h0|) U \u2020 (1 \u2297 |iihi|) U (1 \u2297 |0i)\nThese operators specify a generalized observable on the system, namely a discrete\nPOVM. Remember that we are trying to answer Question 1.1. The point of this\nsimple calculation is that the observable represented by the operators Ai , which is\neffectively measured on the system, is fixed by the choice of the unitary operator\nU , and hence by the physical interaction between the two systems.\nThe problem is that the POVM which is selected in this process depends also\non the observable being measured on the environment. In the special case where\nthe evolution of the system alone is given by Equation 1.1, there is a unique best\nobservable which can be measured via the environment. \"Best\" in the sense that\nany other observation will simply yield less information about the same observable\nof the system (a concept which will be made precise in Section 5.3). However, this\nis not true of the more general case considered here, as can be seen by changing\nthe basis |ii of the environment in the above example. Therefore, the observable\nbeing measured in this process still depends on the good will of an observer. The\nquestion is only shifted to another system: what compelled the observer to choose\nthis particular observable of the environment?\nIn fact, we will show in Chapter 3 that there is only one sharp observable\n(possibly trivial) which can be measured nondestructively in any such process. This\nis the reason why a particular observable is indeed selected in the simpler example\ndefined by Equation 1.1. However, these requirements do not uniquely select a\n\n\f8\n\nIntroduction\n\ngeneral POVM. We will see that for a POVM to be selected uniquely we need to\nintroduce another requirement, namely that the information about the observable\nbe represented redundantly in the environment.\nRedundancy was previously introduced by Ollivier et al. [14] in a slightly different context. The authors attempted to identify the preferred observable, not via\nthe full dynamical process as above, but only by the form of the final state of the\njoint system and environment after the interaction. The idea is that the preferred\nobservable is that which is correlated with some observable of the environment.\nThey indeed showed that a sharp observable of the system is uniquely selected if,\nin addition, these correlations are required to be redundant across many subsystems\nof the environment. Our approach, although it has a different premise, will indeed\nyield such correlations, hence accounting for their analysis.\nOur approach is based on a new method for characterizing the information\npreserved in a quantum communication channel (see Chapter 3). The interaction\nbetween the system and its environment, for instance, involves two main channels.\nThe first sends the initial state of the system to its final state. Equation 1.1 is an\nexample of such a channel. The concept of pointer state and its generalization [15]\nis one way to characterize the information that this channel preserves. The second\nimportant channel is the one which says how the final state of the environment\ndepends on the initial state of the system. This channel has rarely been considered\nexplicitly. However, it is important because it tells us precisely what information\nthe environment learns about the system, and therefore what is being measured in\nthe process.\n\n1.4\n\nFighting decoherence\n\nWe motivated the study of decoherence by the need to understand quantization.\nBut understanding decoherence is also important for a completely different purpose:\nthat of fighting it.\nMost introductory textbooks give the impression that quantum mechanics imposes fundamental barriers on what it is possible to do with a physical system.\nHowever, the restrictions introduced with quantum mechanics are restrictions on\nwhat we can measure, or predict, but they are not restrictions on what a physical\nsystem can do. In fact, these additional constraints on what we can observe allow for a greater freedom in the system's behaviour compared to classical physics.\nIndeed, quantum systems can behave in ways that were previously thought impossible [16]. For instance a computer based on the principles of quantum mechanics\ncould solve problems which are classically intractable [17, 18]. The exact reason is\nnot clear, although it can be understood intuitively from the fact that a quantum\ndynamical process seems to explore an infinite number of paths in parallel, in the\nsense of the path-integral formalism. In fact, a naive attempt at simulating the\ndiscrete evolution of a small finite quantum system rapidly yields an exponential\n\n\fSummary\n\n9\n\nblow-up of the memory required to store the classical representation of the quantum\nstate, as well as an exponential slow-down of the simulation.\nIf we want to exploit the properties of quantum systems for some practical\npurpose, we have to make sure that we can maintain their quantumness, and prevent\nthem from undergoing decoherence. This is far from being an easy task given that\ndecoherence is present in every quantum experimental setups, and is typically much\nfaster than thermalization [8].\nOne way to fight decoherence, or any other form of noise, is to simply avoid it. If\nsome form of noise cannot be eliminated by active control of the environment, one\nmay attempt to encode information in a way which will be resistant to this residual\nnoise. For instance, one may be able to find a subspace which is not affected by the\nnoise (i.e. a decoherence-free subspace) [19, 20, 21, 22]. It is possible to refine this\nidea and find so-called noiseless subsystems [23, 24, 25]. A more elaborate strategy\nis to find some subspaces, or subsystems, which are affected by the noise, but in a\nway which can be reversed. This yields to the method of quantum error correction\n[26, 27, 28, 29, 30], or to its refinement which allows for subsystem codes (operator\nquantum error correction) [31, 32].\nClearly these techniques characterize the information which is preserved by the\nquantum channel representing the noise. For instance, a subspace represents a\nproperty of the quantum system (a yes-no observable). If the effect of the noise\ncan be reversed on this subspace, it means in particular that the information represented by this observable has not been destroyed by the noise. This is precisely\nthe kind of tool that we are looking for in order to understand the process of decoherence. In Chapter 3, we will introduce a concept of preserved information which\nis more general, and better suited for our needs. In Chapter 4 we will show how\nour approach yields, as a special case, a generalization of the theory of quantum\nerror correction for subsystem codes [1, 2], which itself generalizes the other theories mentioned above. Importantly, our approach is suitable for a study of error\ncorrection on infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces. In this context, we show that\nerror correcting codes can be represented by any von Neumann algebras. Whereas\na general von Neumann algebra represents hybrid quantum-classical information,\ntype II and type III factors represent new exotic types of quantum codes which\nexist only on infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces.\n\n1.5\n\nSummary\n\nLet us summarize the problem at hand, and our reasoning. We want to understand\nby what process a quantum system becomes effectively classical, with a focus on\nthe kinematical aspect of the problem. We have pointed out in Section 1.2, and will\nargue in more detail in Section 5.1, that a classical limit, at the kinematical level\n(i.e. everything except the dynamics), must be specified by a generalized observable\nof the quantum theory. Therefore we have identified the type of object that we are\nlooking for: a POVM.\n\n\f10\n\nIntroduction\n\nWe also have a good idea of the type of mechanism which could be at work to\nselect this POVM. The theory of decoherence, which is firmly grounded in theory\nand experiments, tells us that this must essentially be a measurement of the system\nby its environment. An observable is indeed what characterizes the information\ngathered in a measurement.\nHowever, we need to understand what constitutes a measurement of a quantum\nsystem by another quantum system. We expect to be able to do so by studying the\nnature of the information transmitted from one system to the other.\n\n\fChapter 2\nQuantum theory\nThe role of this chapter is to introduce a number of basic concepts, as well as a\ncertain point of view on quantum mechanics which will be referred to in the rest of\nthis thesis. Our presentation is standard in that it follows, at least at the formal\nlevel, the presentation given in Kraus' lecture \"States, Effects and Operations\" [33],\nwhich originates from [34]. The main difference stems in the fact that we are using\na Bayesian interpretation of probabilities rather than a frequentist one.\nThe expressions \"quantum mechanics\" and \"quantum theory\" will be used interchangeably, just like the adjectives \"quantum mechanical\" and \"quantum\". Sometimes, by \"quantum mechanics\" one refers only to Schr\u00f6dinger's model of a nonrelativistic quantum particle, so as to distinguish it from relativistic quantum field\ntheory. Here we refer to quantum mechanics in a much more general sense, as in the\n\"axioms of quantum mechanics\". For example, quantum field theory is an instance\nof a quantum mechanical theory, or at least tend be so (it is not fully formalized).\nQuantum theory is concerned with the common aspects of all quantum systems.\nIn order to present quantum theory, we will take the view that the primary\nelements of a physical theory are yes-no questions, i.e. questions with only two\npossible answers, also called propositions in the field of logic, or effects in quantum\nfoundations. We will mostly use the term \"effect\" once we got used to them.\nHowever, in the beginning we will call them \"propositions\" in order to remind the\nreader of their interpretation. Hence, we will attach a set of propositions E to any\nphysical system of interest.\nSince we are going to have to deal with quantum mechanics in which uncertainties are unavoidable, even in principle, we will not assume that all questions\ncan always be given an exact answer. Instead we assume that a typical answer will\nbe a degree of confidence between zero and one in the truth of the corresponding\nproposition, i.e. a probability. Hence a certain state of knowledge about the system\nis an assignment of a probability to each proposition:\n\u03c1 : E \u2192 [0, 1].\n11\n\n\f12\n\nQuantum theory\n\nSince all predictions of the theory are probabilities of the form \u03c1(\u03b1), we will assume\nthat two propositions \u03b1 and \u03b2 are identical if \u03c1(\u03b1) = \u03c1(\u03b2) for all states \u03c1.\n\n2.1\n\nFinite-dimensional quantum theory\n\nThis section is dedicated to an exposition of finite-dimensional quantum mechanics.\nThis will allow us to introduce most concepts which we will refer to later, while\navoiding the technical issues related to the full infinite-dimensional quantum theory,\nwhich will be covered in Section 2.3. This presentation is not meant to be an\nintroduction to the subject, but rather a way to present a number of concepts\nwhich will be used later. Hence we assume that the reader is already familiar with\nthe basic formalism of quantum theory, including the notion of density matrix.\nFor a quantum system associated with a finite dimensional Hilbert space H, the\npropositions, which are also called effects, will be assumed to be all the self-adjoint\noperators with eigenvalues in the interval [0, 1]:\nE(H) = {A \u2208 M(H) | 0 \u2264 A \u2264 1}\nWere we wrote M(H) for the set of all linear operators on H.\nThe states for this system are the functionals defined by density matrices \u03c1\nthrough\nA 7\u2192 Tr(\u03c1A),\nfor any operator A \u2208 E(H). The set of states therefore is associated with the set\nof density matrices\nS(H) = {\u03c1 \u2208 M(H) | \u03c1 > 0 and Tr(\u03c1) = 1}\nWe will say more about the meaning of the mathematical structures which exist\nin the sets E(H) and S(H) in Section 2.2. For now we will assume that they are just\ngiven. The purpose of this section is to show that the rest of quantum mechanics\nmostly follows from interpreting these mathematical objects as propositions and\nstates.\nThis way of looking at quantum mechanics, although it has a venerable history\n[34], is not widely known. Traditionally one sees an observable\nPas a self-adjoint\noperator X and postulate that its spectral decomposition X = ni=1 xi Pi must be\nused to compute the probabilities Tr(\u03c1Pi ) for each outcome i = 1, . . . , n. Here, Pi\nis the projector on the eigenspace of X with eigenvalue xi . Clearly, the projectors\nPi are effects, as defined above, and the probabilities are obtained by the expected\nformula Tr(\u03c1Pi ). More generally one can introduce the concept of a Positive Operator Valued Measure, or POVM, which generalizes this traditional concept of\nobservable. Indeed, if we let a quantum system interact with an auxiliary system,\nand then measure a \"traditional\" observable on that auxiliary system, we obtain\n\n\fFinite-dimensional quantum theory\n\n13\n\nprobabilities whose dependence on the state \u03c1 of the system is given by the formula\nTr(\u03c1Ai ) where the operators Ai need not be projectors. Indeed, suppose that the\ninitial state of the auxiliary system is |\u03c8i, and that the common evolution of the two\nsystems, until we perform the measurement, is given by the unitary time-evolution\noperator U . If the eigen-projectors of the observable measured on the auxiliary\nsystem are Pi , and if the initial state of the system is \u03c1, then the corresponding\nprobabilities are given by pi = Tr(U (\u03c1 \u2297 |\u03c8ih\u03c8|)U \u2020 (1 \u2297 Pi )), where the first tensor\nfactor corresponds to the system and the second to the auxiliary system. Using the\ncyclicity of the trace, we easily see that this can be written as pi = Tr(\u03c1Ai ) where\nAi := (1 \u2297 h\u03c8|)(U \u2020 (1 \u2297 Pi )U )(1 \u2297 |\u03c8i).\nIn this notation, h\u03c8| is viewed as the linear operator mapping a state |\u03c6i to the\nnumber h\u03c8|\u03c6i. This operator, which in finite-dimension can be seen as a matrix of\njust one row, can be legally tensored with other operators. For instance, A \u2297 h\u03c8|\nmaps a state |\u03c6i \u2297 |\u03c60 i of the two systems into a state of the first system, namely\nA|\u03c6ih\u03c8|\u03c60 i. The ket |\u03c8i is the adjoint of h\u03c8| (a matrix of just one column). It maps\na complex number z to the ket z|\u03c8i. Hence, for instance, 1 \u2297 |\u03c8i maps a state\n|\u03c6i of the system to the composite state |\u03c6i \u2297 |\u03c8i. To see this, we interpret |\u03c6i as\n|\u03c6i \u2297 1, where 1 is the complex number one. The point is that |\u03c6i \u2297 z = z|\u03c6i \u2297 1\nfor any z, which means that tensoring with a complex number does not add any\nmore information: it can be done freely, and simply corresponds to a different way\nof representing the same Hilbert space.\nIn general these operators Ai representing the discrete POVM must\nP only be\nself-adjoint, positive (i.e. with positive eigenvalues), and such that i Ai = 1.\nThis normalization condition in fact implies that the eigenvalues of Ai must also be\nsmaller than 1, which is what we need to make sure that Tr(\u03c1Ai ) is a probability\nbetween 0 and 1. These operators Ai are called POVM elements, or effects, and\nare indeed the operators in our set E(H). Effects P \u2208 E(H) which are projectors:\nP 2 = P will be called sharp. Effects which are not sharp will be called unsharp.\nInstead of referring to the standard notion of observable and POVM, let us\nderive these concepts from scratch starting with the axioms that propositions are\ngiven by the set E(H) and states by functionals of the form A 7\u2192 Tr(\u03c1A). This\nexercise will allow us to introduce the point of view that an observable is essentially\na communication channel from a quantum to a classical system.\nBefore we can define precisely what we mean by that, we first need to explain\nhow to model a classical system also in terms of effects and states.\n\n2.1.1\n\nClassical models\n\nA classical model is always associated with a phase-space \u03a9. For the moment we\nwill ignore any mathematical structure that one may put on a phase-space, like\nthe canonical Poisson structure of mechanical systems. Indeed, we will consider\n\n\f14\n\nQuantum theory\n\ncontexts where \u03a9 would not have any particular structure, for instance in the\ncase where it represents the internal state of a computer, and is therefore discrete.\nNote that it is not usual to call \u03a9 a phase-space when it represents a discrete\nsystem, however it should be clear that even in that context it plays the same role\nas that of a mechanical phase-space. Specifically, any element x \u2208 \u03a9 specifies a\ncomplete knowledge about the classical system, a concept which can be understood\nintuitively, but which will be made precise once we say what the effects and states\nare.\nLet us assume for simplicity that \u03a9 is a finite set. The set of propositions E(\u03a9)\nwill be the set of all functions \u03b1 : \u03a9 \u2192 [0, 1]. These functions can be seen simply\nas vectors with components 0 \u2264 \u03b1i \u2264 1 indexed by i \u2208 \u03a9. The interpretation is\nthe following: if the system is in \"state\" i \u2208 \u03a9, then the proposition \u03b1 is true with\nprobability \u03b1i . In particular, if the components \u03b1i are either 0 or 1 then it selects\na subset \u03c9 \u2286 \u03a9 containing only those \"states\" i \u2208 \u03a9 which make the proposition\n\u03b1 true. This corresponds to the standard notion of a logical proposition. As in\nthe quantum case, these special propositions will be called sharp. The constant\nfunction with value 1 will be denoted by 1 since it plays the same role as the\nidentity operator in the quantum case. Indeed it is the proposition which is always\ntrue.\nIn the quantum case, we referred to the matrix algebra M(H) which is the linear\nspan of the set of propositions E(H). Since we will want to consider maps between\nclassical and quantum propositions, it is convenient to consider the equivalent of\nM(H) in the classical case, namely the complex linear span of E(\u03a9). It consists\nsimply of all complex functions on \u03a9 and will be denoted by L(\u03a9) for the case where\n\u03a9 is finite. L(\u03a9) has more in common with M(H) than the fact of being a complex\nvector space: it is also an algebra in terms of the standard product of functions.\nThe most important difference with the set of operators M(H) is that the product\non L(\u03a9) is commutative. Using this product we can see that what we called classical\nsharp propositions are also the only functions \u03b1 which satisfy \u03b12 = \u03b1, just like in\nthe quantum case. One can also introduce the concept of an adjoint. The adjoint\nf \u2217 of a function f is simply its complex conjugate f , so that the real functions\nare also the self-adjoint functions. For instance, the components of an effect \u03b1\nsatisfy (\u03b1\u2217 )i = \u03b1i = \u03b1i . We see that the range of a function \u03b1 \u2208 L(\u03a9) plays the\nsame role as the set of eigenvalues of an operator A \u2208 M(H). Indeed the classical\npropositions are the self-adjoint, i.e. real, functions with range inside [0, 1]. In\nfact this algebra structure together with the operation of taking the adjoint (\"star\"\noperation ), makes L(\u03a9) into the mathematical structure called a C\u2217 -algebra, which\ncaptures precisely that which is common between quantum and classical systems.\nIndeed M(H) is a C\u2217 -algebra as well. We will see that the systems represented by\nother types of C\u2217 -algebras are in a sense intermediate between being quantum and\nclassical systems, and will come up naturally once we consider the many ways that\nquantum information can be degraded by noise.\nClassical states are of course represented by probability distributions\nP on \u03a9, i.e.\nfunctions \u03bc : \u03a9 \u2192 [0, 1] which are normalized by the condition\ni\u2208\u03a9 \u03bci = 1.\n\n\fFinite-dimensional quantum theory\n\n15\n\nA probability\ndistribution \u03bc represents the functional on proposition defined by\nP\n\u03b1 7\u2192 i \u03b1i \u03bci . Just as in the quantum case, the states S(\u03a9) can be represented by\npositive elements of the algebra L(\u03a9):\nX\nS(\u03a9) = {\u03bc \u2208 L(\u03a9) | \u03bc > 0 and\n\u03bci = 1}.\ni\u2208\u03a9\n\nIn fact, a classical system can also be represented as a quantum system with\nsome constraints on the states that it can take. Indeed, if \u03a9 contains n elements,\nthe algebra L(\u03a9) can be viewed as the set of all diagonal complex n-by-n matrices.\nThe algebra operations, including the star operation (adjoint), are then exactly\nthe quantum ones. In this representation, using the bra-ket\nnotation of quantum\nP\nmechanics, we can write classical propositions as \u03b1 = i\u2208\u03a9 \u03b1i |iihi|. This is in fact\nthe way that one often deal with classical systems in quantum information theory\n(for instance this is what is done in [35]). This notation has the advantage of\ndirectly allowing one to deal with the interaction between coexistent quantum and\nclassical systems while working entirely within the formalism of quantum theory.\n\n2.1.2\n\nObservables as quantum-to-classical maps\n\nIn general we assume that we know how to observe a classical system. This means\nthat if a classical system characterized by the phase-space \u03a9 is given, it is assumed\nby default that we are also given an interpretational framework which tells us what\nthe propositions E(\u03a9) actually mean in terms of possible experimental devices.\nSaid differently, we assume that we would know how to conceive experiments which\nwould test the propositions represented by the effect in E(\u03a9).\nIn addition, it seems reasonable to say that we only directly observe classical\nobjects, i.e. objects which are understood and modeled in classical terms, rather\nthan quantum objects. This means that if we want to make any kind of observation\nof a quantum system, we need to somehow couple it to a measurement apparatus,\na part of which is a classical system that we directly observe. This classical part\nof the measurement apparatus which is pertinent in giving us the outcome of the\nexperiment will be called the pointer. Hence we assume that we can answer any\nquestion (i.e. proposition) about the state of the measurement apparatus' classical\npointer, and that the answers to these questions somehow convey information about\npropositions of the quantum systems. Let \u03a9 be the phase space for the classical\npointer, and H the Hilbert space of the quantum system under observation. We will\nnot need to consider the details of how these two systems might interact. Instead\nwe consider the most general way that propositions about \u03a9 can be translated to\npropositions about H. The translation \"table\" must be given by a map\nX \u2217 : E(\u03a9) \u2192 E(H).\nThe reason for the star will be explained later. This is indeed how we will represent\nan observable on H, with \"spectrum\" \u03a9 (i.e. the set of values it can take). However\nwe need some additional constraints on this map.\n\n\f16\n\nQuantum theory\n\nSuppose that we have some knowledge about the quantum system represented\nby a state \u03c1 \u2208 S(H). This knowledge should allow us to make some prediction\nabout the classical system, i.e. it should translate into some knowledge about\nthe measurement apparatus' pointer, represented by a classical state \u03bc \u2208 S(\u03a9).\nMathematically, this is indeed what we get by using X \u2217 to \"pull back\" the states of\nthe quantum system, which are functionals on E(H). Remember that the density\n\u03c1 represents the functional which sends A to Tr(\u03c1A), for any A \u2208 E(H). Since a\nclassical proposition \u03b1 is mapped to the quantum proposition X \u2217 (\u03b1), we indirectly\nget the function \u03bc : \u03b1 7\u2192 Tr(\u03c1(X \u2217 (\u03b1)) on classical observables. However, for this\nfunctional to be a valid classical state, it has to satisfy certain conditions. In\nparticular, classical states are linear functionals. This means that for any two\neffects \u03b1, \u03b2 \u2208 E(\u03a9), and complex numbers x, y, we must have\nTr(\u03c1(X \u2217 (x\u03b1 + y\u03b2)) = xTr(\u03c1(X \u2217 (\u03b1)) + yTr(\u03c1(X \u2217 (\u03b2))\n= Tr(\u03c1(xX \u2217 (\u03b1) + yX \u2217 (\u03b2))).\nSince this equation must be true for all quantum states \u03c1, it implies the operator\nequation\nX \u2217 (x\u03b1 + y\u03b2) = xX \u2217 (\u03b1) + yX \u2217 (\u03b2)\nHence X \u2217 itself must be linear. Because of this property it extends uniquely to a\nlinear map\nX \u2217 : L(\u03a9) \u2192 M(H).\nWe note this fact because it is convenient to work with linear spaces. However X \u2217\ncannot be any linear map, it must also send E(\u03a9) \u2282 L(\u03a9) entirely into E(H) \u2282\nM(H). This is exactly guaranteed if we require that it be positive, i.e. that it sends\npositive functions on \u03a9 to positive operators on H, and that in addition X \u2217 (1) \u2264 1,\ni.e. that the eigenvalues of X \u2217 (1) be all smaller than 1. However, we must also\nrequire that it sends quantum states to properly normalized functionals on \u03a9, i.e.\nTr(\u03c1X \u2217 (1)) = 1 = Tr(\u03c11) for all \u03c1, which implies\nX \u2217 (1) = 1.\nWe summarize this condition by saying that X \u2217 is unital . Hence, the observables\nmust be represented by linear, positive and unital maps X \u2217 . These conditions are\nall we need on X \u2217 to make sure that it induces a valid map from quantum state to\nclassical states, which we will write as X. Consequently, the map X is also linear: it\nis indeed the linear dual of X \u2217 . Since we are working with finite-dimensional vector\nspaces, X \u2217 is also the dual of X, which justifies the star. The infinite-dimensional\ncase will eventually justify our choice of putting the star on the map which acts on\npropositions, rather than on that map which acts on states.\nSummarizing, the dual map\nX : S(H) \u2192 S(\u03a9)\nwhich pulls quantum states back to classical states, is the restriction to S(\u03a9) \u2286 L(\u03a9)\nof the linear map\nX : M(H) \u2192 L(\u03a9).\n\n\fFinite-dimensional quantum theory\n\n17\n\nThe map X \u2217 could be specified simply as the dual of X. Just as X \u2217 needs to be\npositive, X also must be positive. Indeed it must send quantum states, which are\npositive operators, to classical states which are positive functions. The condition\nX \u2217 (1) = 1 however takes a different form in terms of X. Recall that we arrived\nat this equationPby requiring that X preserves the normalization of states, i.e. if\n\u03bc = X(\u03c1) then i \u03bci = Tr(\u03c1).\nLet us now give a simple representation for the linear maps from L(\u03a9) to M(H).\nSince they are linear, they can be characterized by their action on a basis of L(\u03a9).\nWe will use the canonical basis formed by the functions \u03c7i (j)\nP := \u03b4ij . The action of\nX \u2217 on any classical proposition \u03b1 is, by linearity, X \u2217 (\u03b1) = i \u03b1i X \u2217 (\u03c7i ). Hence X \u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\nis entirely\nP specified\u2217 by the family of effects Xi := X (\u03c7i ). The condition X (1) = 1\nreads\ni Xi = X (1) = 1. Reciprocally, any family of propositions Xi such that\nP\ni Xi = 1 defines an observable through\nX\nX \u2217 (\u03b1) :=\n\u03b1 i Xi .\ni\n\nThe dual X then sends the quantum\nclassical\nP state \u03c1 to the\nP state \u03bc which maps a\n\u2217\nproposition \u03b1 to the probability i \u03b1i \u03bci = Tr(\u03c1X (\u03b1)) = i \u03b1i Tr(\u03c1Xi ). Hence X\nsends \u03c1 to the probability distribution \u03bc defined by\n\u03bci = Tr(\u03c1Xi ).\nP\nThe unitality P\ncondition X \u2217 (1) = 1, which is equivalent to\ni Xi = 1, is\nPalso\nequivalent to\ni \u03bci = Tr(\u03c1). Let us define the classical\ni \u03bci .\nP trace Tr(\u03bc) :=\nNote that it is indeed the trace of the diagonal matrix i \u03bci |iihi| which represents\nthe\nP classical state as a quantum state. Hence we can summarize the condition\ni \u03bci = Tr(\u03c1) by saying that X is trace-preserving.\nThis shows, at least in finite dimension and for a finite number of outcomes,\nthat this notion of observable is equivalent to that of Positive Operator-Valued\nmeasure (POVM). Indeed, a POVM which represents an observable with only a\nfinite number of outcomes belongingPto the set \u03a9 can be defined as a family of\npropositions Ai \u2208 M(H) such that i\u2208\u03a9 Ai = 1. The interpretation associated\nwith it is that, if \u03c1 is the state of the system, then the outcome labelled by i is true\nwith probability Tr(\u03c1Ai ), which is precisely what we obtained for our concept of\nobservable.\nNote that effects are one-to-one with a particular class of observables, namely\nobservables with two values, i.e. defined for \u03a9 = {0, 1}. Indeed, given any effect\nA \u2208 E(H), one can define the observable X : L({0, 1}) \u2192 E(H) by\nX0 = X \u2217 (\u03c70 ) = A and X1 = X \u2217 (\u03c71 ) = 1 \u2212 A.\nThis gives a particular interpretation for the effect 1 \u2212 A: it is the alternative to A\nin an observation of A.\nLet us also show how we can recover the more conservative notion of observable,\nnamely what we will call sharp observables. A sharp observable X is an observable\n\n\f18\n\nQuantum theory\n\nwhich maps sharp effects to sharp effects, i.e. such that for all sharp classical effect\n\u03c7\u03c9 (the characteristic function for a subset \u03c9 \u2286 \u03a9), the image X \u2217 (\u03c7\u03c9 ) is a projector,\nXi for all\ni.e. (X \u2217 (\u03c7\u03c9 ))2 = X \u2217 (\u03c7\u03c9 ). In fact this is equivalent to requiring that Xi2 = P\n2\n2\n=\n(1\n\u2212\nX\n)X\n=\n0.\nBut\n1\n\u2212\nX\n=\n=\nX\n,\nthen\nX\n\u2212\nX\ni \u2208 \u03a9. Indeed,\nif\nX\ni\ni\ni\ni\ni\ni\ni\nj6=i Xj .\nP\nHence also j6=i Xi Xj Xi = 0. Since this is a sum of positive operators, this implies\nthat Xi Xj Xi = (Xi Xj )\u2217 (Xi Xj ) = 0 for all j, which in turn implies Xj Xi = 0 for\nall i and j.PFrom the orthogonality of the effects Xi it is easy to see than any sum\nX \u2217 (\u03c7\u03c9 ) = i\u2208\u03c9 Xi is a projector as well.\nIn fact, this also proves that these projectors\nP are automatically orthogonal.\nSince also they are complete in the sense that i Xi = 1, then they can\nP be seen\nas the projectors on the eigenspaces of a self-adjoint operator A =\ni\u2208\u03a9 \u03bbi Xi ,\nwhich is indeed the standard notion of an observable. Here \u03bbi can be any family of\ndistinct realPnumbers. In fact, to be pedantic, we could make sure that \u03a9 \u2282 R and\nwrite A = \u03bb\u2208\u03a9 \u03bbXi . However the actual eigenvalues matter little for a discrete\nobservable.\n\n2.1.3\n\nCapacity of an observable\n\nIntuitively, measuring a sharp observable should yield more information about the\nsystem than measuring an unsharp one, provided that they have the same number\nof outcomes. Viewing observables as communication channels yields a natural way\nto make this concept precise, namely the information capacity of an observable.\nThe idea is the following. Suppose that Alice can prepare a given quantum\nsystem in any state she wants, and Bob is going to measure the observable X of\nthis system. If the two can agree of a protocol beforehand, how many bits can\nAlice communicate in this way to Bob? In order to make this more precise, one\nmust consider that they will actually use an arbitrary large number of systems,\nand see how many bits Alice can transmit per system, in average, as the number\nof systems goes to infinity. This is a direct parallel to the definition of capacity\nfor a classical channel. In fact, it can be reduced to it, as shown by the HolevoSchumacher-Westmorland (HSW) theorem [35].\nIndeed, the process by which Alice will encode her classical bits into a quantum\nstate is itself a channel, in this case a classical-to-quantum channel, also called a\nstate-preparation procedure. Let us call such a channel \u03c6. Since \u03c6 is linear and\nacts on L(\u03a9), it can be characterized by its action on the basis states \u03c7i . Let us\nwrite \u03c1i = \u03c6(\u03c7i ) for the quantum\nP states which are image of these basis states. For\na general classical state \u03bc = i \u03bci \u03c7i , we have\nX\n\u03c6(\u03bc) =\n\u03bci \u03c1 i .\ni\n\nIf we compose this classical-to-quantum channel \u03c6 with the quantum-to-classical\nchannel X, we obtain simply a classical channel X \u25e6\u03c6, for which a Shannon capacity\n\n\fFinite-dimensional quantum theory\n\n19\n\nC(X\u25e6\u03c6) can be computed. The HSW theorem then states that the classical capacity\nof the channel X is given by\nC(X) = sup C(X \u25e6 \u03c6).\n\u03c6\n\nSince the HSW theorem is usually expressed for general quantum channel, this\nformulation is not usual. Let us therefore show that this is indeed equivalent to the\nformula given in [35], namely\n\u0010\n\u0011\nX\nX\nC(X) = sup S(X(\n\u03bci \u03c1 i ) \u2212\n\u03bci S(X(\u03c1i ))\n(2.1)\n\u03bci \u03c1i\n\ni\n\ni\n\nWhere, by S(\u03bc), we mean the von-Neumann entropy of the quantum state whose\neigenvalues are given by the classical distribution \u03bc, which is simply the Shannon\nentropy of \u03bc: S(\u03bc) = H(\u03bc).\nNote that C(X \u25e6 \u03c6) is the maximum over all initial states \u03bc of the mutual\ninformation for the joint probability p(i, j) of getting outcome \u03c7j and input \u03c7i . This\njoint probability is given by p(j|i)\u03bci , where p(j|i) = X(\u03c6(\u03c7i ))j is the probability to\nget outcome \u03c7jPgiven that the input was\nP \u03c7i . Therefore p(i, j) = X(\u03c6(\u03c7i ))j \u03bci and\nhas marginals j X(\u03c6(\u03c7i ))j = \u03bci and i X(\u03c6(\u03c7i ))j \u03bci = X(\u03c6(\u03bc))j . We therefore\nhave\nC(X \u25e6 \u03c6) = sup[H(X(\u03c6(\u03bc))) + H(\u03bc) \u2212 H(p)].\n\u03bc\n\nBut note that\nH(\u03bc) \u2212 H(p) = \u2212\n\nX\n\n=\u2212\n\nX\n\n\u03bci log2 (\u03bci ) +\n\nX\n\ni\n\nij\n\n\u0010\n\n\u03bci log2 (\u03bci ) \u2212\n\nX\n\ni\n\n=\n\nX\n\n\u03bci\n\ni\n\n=\u2212\n\np(i, j) log2 (p(i, j))\n\u0011\np(j|i) log2 (p(i, j))\n\nj\n\nX\n\np(j|i) log2 (p(j|i))\n\nj\n\nX\n\n\u03bci H(X(\u03c6(\u03c7i )))\n\ni\n\nand so,\nC(X) = sup C(X \u25e6 \u03c6) = sup[H(X(\u03c6(\u03bc))) \u2212\n\u03c6\n\nX\n\n\u03bci H(X(\u03c6(\u03c7i )))]\n\n\u03c6,\u03bc\n\ni\n\u0011\nX\nX\n= sup S(X(\n\u03bci \u03c1i )) \u2212\n\u03bci H(X(\u03c1i ))\n\n\u0010\n\n\u03bci ,\u03c1i\n\ni\n\ni\n\nwhich is indeed equal to Equation 2.1.\nWhen applied to a discrete sharp observable, this quantity is equal to the logarithm of the number of outcomes. Indeed, if X is sharp, then the optimal strategy\nfor Alice consists in encoding her classical states into eigenstates of X. The number\nof states that she can encode in this way is the number of distinct eigenstates n of\nX. This corresponds to log2 (n) bits.\n\n\f20\n\n2.1.4\n\nQuantum theory\n\nQuantum channels\n\nWe want to consider the most general way that a quantum system B can encode\ninformation about another quantum system A, as specified by a map\nE \u2217 : E(HB ) \u2192 E(HA )\nwhich translates each proposition on system B into a proposition of system A. All\nthe points made in the discussion of observables are still valid here, even though\nwe have replaced the classical system by the quantum system B. Indeed the only\nalgebraic properties of states and effects that we have used in our presentation\ninvolved the linearity and the positivity of effects and states, which form the same\nalgebraic structure in the quantum and in the classical case (more will be said about\nwhat this structure is in Section 2.3). Hence the most general such map E \u2217 , which\nis also required to induce a valid map from states of system A to states of system\nB, must extend to a unital positive linear map\nE \u2217 : M(HB ) \u2192 M(HA ).\nThis map is the dual of a trace-preserving positive linear map\nE : M(HA ) \u2192 M(HB )\nwhich maps states of A to states of B. The relation between the two can be simply\nexpressed from the fact that they yield the same probabilities:\nTr(E(\u03c1)A) = Tr(\u03c1E \u2217 (A))\nfor all states \u03c1 and all effects A.\nHowever we need another important condition which happens to be implicitly\nsatisfied in the case of the quantum-to-classical maps which define observables. We\nneed to make sure that if our systems A and B were only parts of larger systems,\nthen our map could be trivially extended to those larger systems. This means\nthat, if we add a third system C with Hilbert space HC , then the map E \u2217 \u2297 id from\nM(HA \u2297HC ) to M(HB \u2297HC ) defined by (E \u2217 \u2297id)(X \u2297Y ) := E \u2217 (X)\u2297Y , should also\nbe unital, positive and linear. Unitality and linearity come for free. However the\npositivity must be postulated. If E \u2217 \u2297 id is positive no matter what the dimension\nof the auxiliary system C is, then we say that E \u2217 is completely positive. In this case,\nthe dual E \u2297 id is also automatically completely positive. This condition is not only\nphysically reasonable, but also mathematically extremely useful since it allows one\nto apply a powerful representation theorem by Choi [36], which states that there is\na family of operators Ek (the channel's elements) such that\nX\nE \u2217 (X) =\nEk\u2217 XEk\nk\n\nfrom which it is easy to see that also\nE(\u03c1) =\n\nX\nk\n\nEk \u03c1Ek\u2217 .\n\n\fFinite-dimensional quantum theory\n\n21\n\nIn fact any map of this form is completely positive (and of course linear). Unitality\nof E \u2217 requires in addition that\nX\nE \u2217 (1) =\nEk\u2217 Ek = 1.\nk\n\nLet us state and prove Choi's theorem for completeness.\nTheorem 2.1. A linear map E from P\nM(HA ) to M(HB ) is completely positive\nif and only if it has the form E(\u03c1) = k Ek \u03c1Ek\u2217 for a family of linear operators\nEk : HA \u2192 HB .\nP\n\u2217\nProof. First, it is clear\nP that a \u2217map defined by E(\u03c1) = k Ek \u03c1Ek is positive. Indeed,\nif \u03c1 is positive then k Ek \u03c1Ek is a sum ofPpositive operators, which is also positive.\nIn addition, its extension (E \u2297 id)(\u03c1) = k (Ek \u2297 1)\u03c1(Ek \u2297 1)\u2217 has the same form\nand is therefore positive too, which show that E is completely positive. For the\nconverse, suppose that E is completely positive. Let us view E as going from the\ncomplement of its kernel ker(E)\u22a5 to its range ran(E). Since these subspaces have\nequal dimensions, they can be both identified with the same space H. Consider\naPbasis |ii of H. Consider also the Hilbert space H \u2297 H and the operator A :=\nij |iihj| \u2297 |jihi| acting on it. Note that A is positive. Indeed for any state\n|\u03a8i := |\u03c8i \u2297 |\u03c6i with components \u03c8i \u03c6j := hi|\u03c8ihj|\u03c6i, we have\n!\n!\nX\nX\nX\n\u03c8 i \u03c8j \u03c6j \u03c6i =\n\u03c8 i \u03c6i\n\u03c8 j \u03c6j \u2265 0\nh\u03a8|A|\u03a8i =\ni\n\nij\n\nj\n\nSince E is completely positive, (E \u2297 id)(A) is a positive operator on HA \u2297 HB .\nTherefore it has a complete set of orthogonal eigenvectors |vk i \u2208 HA \u2297 HB . This\nmeans that it can be written as\nX\n(E \u2297 id)(A) =\n|vk ihvk |\nk\n\nwhere the norm of the vector |vi i is the square of the corresponding eigenvalue.\nExplicitly this means that\nX\nX\nE(|iihj|) \u2297 |jihi| =\n|vk ihvk |\nij\n\nk\n\nby multiplying by 1 \u2297 hj| on the left and 1 \u2297 |ii on the right we get\nX\nE(|iihj|) =\n(1 \u2297 hj|)|vk ihvk |(1 \u2297 |ii)\nk\n\nwhich is equivalent to\nE(|iihj|) =\n\nX\n\n=\n\nX\n\n=\n\nX\n\nhvk |(|lihl| \u2297 |iihj|)|vk i\n\nlk\n\nhvk |(|lihl| \u2297 |iihj|)|vk i\n\nlk\n\nlk\n\nhvk |(|li \u2297 1) |iihj| (hl| \u2297 1)|vk i\n\n\f22\n\nQuantum theory\n\nBut since |iihj| form a basis of all operators on H, we have by linearity\nX\nE(\u03c1) =\nhvk |(|li \u2297 1) \u03c1 (hl| \u2297 1)|vk i\nlk\n\nfor any operator \u03c1 on H. This is the representation that we seeked, with elements\nEkl := hvk |(|li \u2297 1).\n\nSuch a map between states, namely a trace-preserving completely-positive linear\nmap, will be called a quantum channel, or simply a channel. In order to avoid\nconfusion, we will only call a channel the map E on states. E \u2217 will simply be called\nits dual. We may also call an observable X a quantum-to-classical channel since it\nsends quantum states to classical states.\n\n2.1.5\n\nTransformation of observables: the Heisenberg picture\n\nAll observables X are basically made out of effects, namely those in the image\nof X \u2217 : X \u2217 (\u03b1) \u2208 E(H). For convenience, we will refer to them as the effects of\nX. Since the dual of a channel maps effects to effects, it also maps observables to\nobservables. Indeed, consider the observable Y \u2217 defined by Y \u2217 (\u03b1) := E \u2217 (X \u2217 (\u03b1)) for\nall classical effects \u03b1. To see that Y \u2217 is indeed an observable, simply note that it\nis unital, positive and linear, because both E \u2217 and X \u2217 are. This equation can also\nbe written as\nY \u2217 = E \u2217 \u25e6 X \u2217 or Y = X \u25e6 E\nor simply in terms of the elements Yi = Y \u2217 (\u03c7i ) and Xi = X \u2217 (\u03c7i ) as\nYi = E \u2217 (Xi )\nAn alternative way of writing this equation, which is intuitively helpful, is as a\ncommutative diagram showing the flow of information between states of the three\nsystems involved, namely the source quantum system A, the target quantum system\nB, and the classical pointer \u03a9.\nM(HA )\n\nEM(HB )\nY\n\nX\n-\n\n?\n\nL(\u03a9)\nEach object can be seen as a physical system, be it quantum or classical, and each\narrow as a transfer of information between systems. An arrow from a quantum to\n\n\fFinite-dimensional quantum theory\n\n23\n\na classical system corresponds to an observation. We will see later that this can be\nformally seen as a diagram in the category where the objects are the pre-dual of\nvon Neumann algebras and the morphisms the trace-preserving completely-positive\nlinear maps between them. The correct way to read such a diagram is as a set of\nequations stating that each possible path between two objects are equal.\nThis is how the channel E acts on observables. In the case where E represents\nsome time evolution for a certain interval of time, this is simply the Heisenberg\npicture. Indeed, in the case of a unitary evolution Ut , remember that we get the\nHeisenberg picture by noting that what matters are expectation values of the form\nh\u03c8(t)|A|\u03c8(t)i for a self-adjoint operator A representing a sharp observable, and for\nthe time-dependant state |\u03c8(t)i = Ut |\u03c8i. These expectation values can alternatively be written as h\u03c8|Ut\u2217 AUt |\u03c8i = h\u03c8|A(t)|\u03c8i, where we defined A(t) := Ut\u2217 AUt .\nHence we can either assume that our knowledge represented by the states evolves\nas a function of time (the Schr\u00f6dinger picture), or alternatively assume that our\nknowledge is fixed, but that it is our interpretation of what the observables are\nwhich changes with time: a point of view called the Heisenberg picture. A channel\nE specifies a more general type of evolution, however the scheme is the same. We\ntook the more general expectations values (probabilities) of the form Tr(\u03c1A) as the\nfundamental predictions of the theory, and noted that a given map E \u2217 on effects also\ninduces a map E on states through the relation Tr(E(\u03c1)A) = Tr(\u03c1E \u2217 (A)). Hence\nthe map E \u2217 , which says how effects evolve in the case of a fixed state, specifies\nthe evolution in the Heisenberg picture. However, writing an observable X as a\nchannel, rather than in terms of its elementary effect Xi , we can also write the\nHeisenberg evolution using the \"Schr\u00f6dinger\" channel E, as X 7\u2192 Y = X \u25e6 E.\nHowever there is something that this more general picture renders apparent\nwhich is normally overlooked in the unitary case. It should be clear by now that\nif the channel maps states of a system A to states of another system B, then the\neffect of the channel in the dual Heisenberg picture is to map observables of B to\nobservable of A, i.e. it goes \"backward\". This can also be seen by looking at what\nhappens if we compose two channels E and E 0 . We get the new channel E 0 \u25e6 E.\nBut in the Heisenberg picture the action is given by (E 0 \u25e6 E)\u2217 = E \u2217 \u25e6 (E 0 )\u2217 . Hence\nin the Heisenberg picture we have to apply the latest channel first. If the channel\nrepresents a time evolution, one way to interpret this is to think of the observable\nY = X \u25e6 E as that which, if measured at the initial time, would yield the same\nresult as X measured at the later time.\n\n2.1.6\n\nMeasurements\n\nWe have argued that the most general way that a classical system with phase-space\n\u03a9 can hold information about a quantum system defined by the Hilbert space H, is\nspecified by a trace-preserving linear map X : M(H) \u2192 L(\u03a9). But if we actually\nperform this measurement, we may expect that the quantum system that we have\nmeasured still exists afterward. This means that the process of measurement should\n\n\f24\n\nQuantum theory\n\nmap the state of our system not only to the state of our measurement apparatus'\npointer, but also to the later state of the system itself as well. Hence it should be\na channel\nE : M(H) \u2192 M(H) \u2297 L(\u03a9)\nwith dual\nE \u2217 : M(H) \u2297 L(\u03a9) \u2192 M(H)\nwhere H is the Hilbert space of our quantum system and \u03a9 the phase-space of the\nmeasurement apparatus' pointer.\nIn order to see what the tensor product between a quantum and a classical\nsystem is, consider the representation of classical states and classical effects as diagonal quantum states and diagonalPquantum effects. For instance, the classical\neffect \u03b1 can be represented as \u03b1 = i\u2208\u03a9\nP \u03b1i |iihi|. Its tensor product with a quantum effect A then is simply A \u2297 \u03b1 = i\u2208\u03a9 \u03b1i A \u2297 |iihi|. This shows that in this\nrepresentation, the space M(H) \u2297 L(\u03a9) consists of block-diagonal matrices. It is\nin fact a subalgebra of the algebra of full matrices. It defines in its own right a\nphysical system which is not quantum nor classical, but hybrid quantum-classical.\nWe will see more general structures of this type in Section 2.3 where they will be\nformalized as C\u2217 -algebras.\nFor the process represented by E to represents the measurement of a specific\nobservable X we require that\nE \u2217 (1 \u2297 \u03b1) = X \u2217 (\u03b1)\n\n(2.2)\n\nfor any classical effect \u03b1 \u2208 E(\u03a9). Indeed, 1\u2297\u03b1 is an effect on the joint system which\nsimply ignores the quantum system, since 1 is true no matter what the state of the\nquantum system is. Note that the dual of the completely positive map \u03b1 7\u2192 1 \u2297 \u03b1 is\nthe partial trace over the quantum system. Indeed, given a basis |ii of the quantum\nsystem, we can write this channel explicitly in terms of its elements:\nX\nX\n\u03b1 7\u2192\n|iihi| \u2297 \u03b1 =\n(|ii \u2297 1) \u03b1 (hi| \u2297 1).\ni\n\ni\n\nWe therefore immediately obtain the dual map on states by swapping the elements:\nX\nX\n\u03c1 \u2297 \u03bc 7\u2192\n(hi| \u2297 1)(\u03c1 \u2297 \u03bc)(|ii \u2297 1) =\nhi|\u03c1|ii \u03bc = Tr(\u03c1)\u03bc = \u03bc.\ni\n\ni\n\nEquation 2.2 implies that E \u2217 (1 \u2297 \u03c7i ) = Xi for all i \u2208 \u03a9. Note that the maps Fi\u2217\ndefined by\nFi\u2217 (A) := E \u2217 (A \u2297 \u03c7i )\nfrom M(H) to itself are completely positive, although not unital. These maps can\nbe anything apart from the requirement given by Equation 2.2, which is\nFi\u2217 (1) = Xi .\n\n\fFinite-dimensional quantum theory\n\n25\n\nHence the most general form of a measurement of the observable X is as a map\nX\nE \u2217 (A \u2297 \u03b1) =\n\u03b1i Fi\u2217 (A)\ni\n\nfor some completely positive maps Fi\u2217 which satisfy Fi\u2217 (1) = Xi . The dual E is\ngiven by\nX\nE(\u03c1) =\nFi (\u03c1) \u2297 \u03c7i .\ni\n\nIf we representP\nthe classical system as a diagonal quantum system, we could write\nthis as E(\u03c1) = i Fi (\u03c1) \u2297 |iihi|.\nHence, if our knowledge of the system was represented by \u03c1, then after it has\ninteracted with the measurement device,\nour joint knowledge of the system and the\nP\npointer is represented by the state i Fi (\u03c1) \u2297 \u03c7i . In order to see what this implies,\nlet us consider a second measurement after this one.\n\n2.1.7\n\nRepeated measurements and collapse\n\nSuppose that we perform a measurement of X as specified above, followed by a\nmeasurement of a second observable X 0 associated with the phase-space \u03a90 . By\ncomposing the measurement E with the channel X 0 applied on the final state of the\nquantum system, we obtain the purely classical state \u03bc of the two pointers:\nX\nX\n\u03bc=\nX 0 (Mi (\u03c1)) \u2297 \u03c7i =\nTr(Fi (\u03c1)Xj0 )(\u03c7j \u2297 \u03c7i )\ni\n\nij\n\nThis is simply the functional way of writing the joint probability distribution\n\u03bcij = Tr(Fi (\u03c1)Xj0 )\nwhere i \u2208 \u03a9 is the outcome of the first measurement and j \u2208 \u03a90 the outcome of the\nsecond. From this joint probability distribution we can compute the conditional\nprobability p(j|i) of obtaining outcome j \u2208 \u03a90 in the second measurement, knowing\nthat the outcome of the first measurement was i \u2208 \u03a9:\nTr(Fi (\u03c1)Xj0 )\n\u03bcij\n=\np(j|i) = P\nTr(Fi (\u03c1))\nj \u03bcij\n= Tr(\u03c1i Xj0 )\nwhere we have introduced the quantum states\n\u03c1i :=\n\nFi (\u03c1)\n.\nTr(Fi (\u03c1))\n\nSince X 0 is not involved in the definition of \u03c1i , we see that after the measurement\nof X, and the finding of the measurement apparatus' pointer in state i \u2208 \u03a9, our\n\n\f26\n\nQuantum theory\n\nknowledge about the quantum system can be updated to the new state \u03c1i , which\nhas the usual form given by the collapse postulate.\nFor instance, if the observable X is sharp, in the sense that all the effects Xi = Pi\nare sharp: Pi2 = Pi , then one possible choice of measurement apparatus is given by\nFi (\u03c1) := Pi \u03c1Pi\nThis indeed defines a measurement of X, since Fi\u2217 (1) = Pi2 = Pi . We then obtain\nthe usual state update formula\n\u03c1i =\n\n2.2\n\nPi \u03c1Pi\n.\nTr(Pi \u03c1)\n\nEffect algebras\n\nThis section is meant to give some logical motivations for the mathematical structures that we postulated on both the quantum and classical sets of propositions.\nIt is interesting to note that a physical transformation (channel) is not required to\ncompletely preserve all of these structures. For instance, the product of effects need\nnot be preserved. The main algebraic structure which is preserved is the addition\nof effects. We introduce here one program of axiomatization of quantum mechanics\nwhich is based on this structure [37].\nLet us suppose that the set E represents the propositions associated with some\nphysical system. We assume that we also have a set of states S on it, which assign\na probability to each proposition. We want to define on E a generalization of the\nlogical \"or\" between disjoint propositions. We write \u03b3 = \u03b1+\u03b2 for three propositions\n\u03b1, \u03b2 and \u03b3 whenever \u03c1(\u03b3) = \u03c1(\u03b1) + \u03c1(\u03b2) for all states \u03c1. Addition of probabilities\nis indeed what we expect for the logical disjunction of two propositions. In general,\nthe sum \u03b1+\u03b2 cannot be defined for all pairs of propositions \u03b2 and \u03b1 since \u03c1(\u03b1)+\u03c1(\u03b2)\nmight be greater than 1. Pairs of propositions for which the sum exists will be said\nto be valid alternatives. The sum \u03b1 + \u03b2, when it exists, can always be assumed to\nbe unique, given that the corresponding probabilities are defined uniquely by the\nrelation \u03c1(\u03b1 + \u03b2) = \u03c1(\u03b1) + \u03c1(\u03b2) for any state \u03c1.\nOne property that we get for free from this definition is that \u03b1 + \u03b2 = \u03b2 + \u03b1.\nMany interesting results can be obtained with this structure if we postulate a few\nuseful axioms which make E into an effect algebra [37]. In order to get a sort of\nassociativity, we assume that if \u03b1 + \u03b2 and \u03b3 + (\u03b1 + \u03b2) are defined, then (\u03b3 + \u03b1) + \u03b2\nis defined too. From the definition of the addition as it relates to states, we get\n(\u03b3 +\u03b1)+\u03b2 = \u03b3 +(\u03b1+\u03b2). Next we postulate that there are two special propositions:\nthe proposition 0 which is always false, i.e. \u03c1(0) = 0 for any state \u03c1, and the\nproposition 1 which is always true, i.e. \u03c1(1) = 1 for any state \u03c1. We then assume\nthat for any proposition \u03b1, there is a proposition \u03b2 such that \u03b1 + \u03b2 = 1. \u03b2 can be\nwritten as \u03b2 = 1\u2212\u03b1. It can be interpreted as the negation of \u03b1. Indeed for any state\n\n\fEffect algebras\n\n27\n\n\u03c1 such that \u03c1(\u03b1) = 1, we have \u03c1(1 \u2212 \u03b1) + \u03c1(\u03b1) = \u03c1(1) = 1. Hence \u03c1(1 \u2212 \u03b1) + 1 = 1,\nwhich implies \u03c1(1\u2212\u03b1) = 0. This shows that the complement 1\u2212\u03b1 is false whenever\n\u03b1 is true. Conversely we also have that 1 \u2212 \u03b1 is true whenever \u03b1 is false, which is\nwhat we expect of the negation of \u03b1.\nThe last axiom needed to define an effect algebra is that 1 + \u03b1 exists only for\n\u03b1 = 0. In addition, we assume for the moment that there are no other restrictions\non states other than those implied in the definition of +, 0 and 1. This means that\nthe set of states consists of all the functions \u03c1 from E to the interval [0, 1] which\nare such that \u03c1(\u03b1) + \u03c1(\u03b2) = \u03c1(\u03b1 + \u03b2), \u03c1(0) = 0 and \u03c1(1) = 1.\nAn interesting property of an effect algebra is that it automatically comes with\na partial order defined by \u03b1 < \u03b2 whenever \u03b3 + \u03b1 = \u03b2 for some proposition \u03b3. This\nrelation can be understood as a form of logical implication from \u03b1 to \u03b2. Indeed\nfor any state \u03c1 such that \u03c1(\u03b1) = 1, i.e. any state for which \u03b1 is true, we have\n0 \u2264 \u03c1(\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b1) = \u03c1(\u03b2) \u2212 \u03c1(\u03b1) = \u03c1(\u03b2) \u2212 1. Hence 1 \u2265 \u03c1(\u03b2) \u2265 1, which implies\n\u03c1(\u03b2) = 1, i.e. \u03b2 is true. Hence \u03b1 implies \u03b2.\n\n2.2.1\n\nLinear effect algebras\n\nThe effects algebras of quantum and classical systems have an additional simple\nstructure in common which makes the above axioms more concrete and easier to\nunderstand.\nSuppose that we are given an ordered vector space V with a special element\ne > 0. An ordered vector space is a vector space with a partial order \u2264 satisfying\nu \u2264 v if and only if 0 \u2264 v \u2212 u, and 0 \u2264 \u03bbv for all 0 \u2264 v and \u03bb \u2208 R+ . Then an effect\nalgebra is automatically formed by those elements of V which are larger than the\nzero vector 0 and smaller than e:\nE(V ) := {\u03b1 \u2208 V | 0 \u2264 \u03b1 \u2264 e}.\nThis set E(V ) is an effect algebra for the partially-defined addition defined by the\naddition of vectors, with the false proposition given by the zero vector and the true\nproposition given by the specially chosen vector e. The natural partial order of\nthis effect algebra is of course the one which we started from. Hence what we have\ndone was to use the partial order to tell which vectors can be added. Indeed we\nhave that \u03b1 + \u03b2 exists exactly when \u03b1 + \u03b2 \u2264 1. Such a structure is called a linear\neffect algebra [38]. Note that since we are only interested in the vector space in the\nextent that it defines the effect algebra, we will always assume that V is the span\nof the effect algebra E(V ).\nNote that the states are automatically given by linear maps on V . Indeed, a state\n\u03c1 is required to satisfy \u03c1(\u03b1 + \u03b2) = \u03c1(\u03b1) + \u03c1(\u03b2) for any effects \u03b1 and \u03b2. This means\nthat for any positive integer n such that n\u03b1 \u2264 1, we must have \u03c1(n\u03b1) = n\u03c1(\u03b1).\nIn addition, for any positive integer m we have \u03b1 = m m1 \u03b1, hence \u03c1(\u03b1) = m\u03c1( m1 \u03b1),\nwhich implies \u03c1( m1 \u03b1) = m1 \u03c1(\u03b1). Combining the two results, for any positive rational\n\n\f28\n\nQuantum theory\n\nn\nand effect \u03b1 such that q\u03b1 \u2264 1, we have \u03c1(q\u03b1) = q\u03c1(\u03b1). In addition, note that\nq=m\n\u03b1 < \u03b2 implies \u03c1(\u03b1) \u2264 \u03c1(\u03b2). Indeed, \u03b1 < \u03b2 means that there exists 0 \u2264 \u03b3 \u2264 1 such\nthat \u03b1 + \u03b3 = \u03b2, from which we have \u03c1(\u03b1) + \u03c1(\u03b3) = \u03c1(\u03b2), and hence, \u03c1(\u03b1) \u2264 \u03c1(\u03b2).\nNow for any real 0 \u2264 r \u2264 1, consider a sequence 0 \u2264 qn \u2264 r \u2208 Q and a sequence\n1 \u2265 qn0 \u2265 r \u2208 Q both converging to r. We have qn \u03c1(\u03b1) = \u03c1(qn \u03b1) \u2264 \u03c1(r\u03b1) \u2264\n\u03c1(qn0 \u03b1) = qn0 \u03c1(\u03b1) for all n. In the limit, this implies r\u03c1(\u03b1) = \u03c1(r\u03b1).\n\n2.2.2\n\nMorphisms between effect algebras\n\nWe want to consider maps between two effect algebras:\n\u03c6 : EB \u2192 EA\nWe have seen that once we specialize to quantum and classical systems, the interesting maps are those which preserve the addition of effects, i.e. \u03c6(\u03b1) + \u03c6(\u03b2) is\ndefined whenever \u03b1 + \u03b2 is, and\n\u03c6(\u03b1 + \u03b2) = \u03c6(\u03b1) + \u03c6(\u03b2)\nThis automatically implies that \u03c6(0) = 0. But in addition we require that\n\u03c6(1) = 1.\nThese assumptions are what we need for the map \u03c6 to make sense as a transformation of states. Indeed, consider a state \u03c1A of EA . We automatically obtain a\nfunction \u03c1B on EB defined by \u03c1B (\u03b1B ) = \u03c1A (\u03c6(\u03b1B )), i.e.\n\u03c1A 7\u2192 \u03c1B = \u03c1A \u25e6 \u03c6\nAlthough the function \u03c1B is always defined, it may not be a state. It will be a\nstate if it satisfies \u03c1B (\u03b1 + \u03b2) = \u03c1B (\u03b1) + \u03c1B (\u03b2) and \u03c1B (1) = 1. The first condition\nimplies that \u03c1A (\u03c6(\u03b1 + \u03b2)) = \u03c1A (\u03c6(\u03b1)) + \u03c1A (\u03c6(\u03b2)) for all \u03c1A , which implies that\n\u03c6(\u03b1+\u03b2) = \u03c6(\u03b1)+\u03c6(\u03b2). From the second condition we have 1 = \u03c1B (1) = \u03c1A (\u03c6(1)) =\n\u03c1A (1) for all \u03c1A , which implies \u03c6(1) = 1. Maps \u03c6 having these properties will be\ncalled morphisms as they preserve all the structures of the effect algebras. They\ncorrespond to the most general transformations which maps states of A to states\nof B and effects of B to effects of A.\nFor both quantum and classical systems, these morphisms almost define what\nthe possible physical transformations are. In the quantum case we will just need\none additional assumption which will be that \u03c6 must also be a morphism if the\nsystem of interest is only part of a larger system. However, we have not introduced\nthe structure needed in order to define a subsystem in this abstract framework. In\nfact, the question of what structure one needs to add to an abstract effect algebra,\nif any, in order to define this concept, is an open research problem.\nIf E(VA ) and E(VB ) are two linear effect algebras built respectively from the\nvectors spaces VA and VB , then the morphisms are the linear maps \u03c6 from VB to VA\nwhich are positive, and such that \u03c6(1) = 1. The map \u03c6 is called positive if \u03c6(\u03b1) \u2265 0\nwhenever \u03b1 \u2265 0. This is all that is required for \u03c6 to preserve the order structure\nand therefore the induced effect algebra structure.\n\n\fEffect algebras\n\n2.2.3\n\n29\n\nStates\n\nLet us say a little bit more about states. Note that the real interval [0, 1] itself is\na linear effect algebra in terms of the addition of real numbers, and the natural\ncomplete order of real numbers. Hence the set of states on an effect algebra E is\nsimply the set of morphisms from E to [0, 1].\nIf E is a linear effect algebra spanning the vector space V then the states are\nelements of the dual space V \u2217 . For instance, when V is finite-dimensional, V \u2217 is a\nvector space of same dimension as V . Note that V \u2217 is an ordered vector space like\nV . Indeed, for an elements \u03c1 \u2208 V \u2217 , we have \u03c1 \u2265 0 if \u03c1(\u03b1) \u2265 0 for all \u03b1 \u2265 0. This is\nof course the kind of positivity which is required of a state \u03c1. Therefore states are\npositive elements of the dual space V \u2217 . In addition we have to require \u03c1(1) = 1. In\norder to make connection with what follows, let us define the trace of an element\n\u03c1 \u2208 V \u2217 as\nTr(\u03c1) := \u03c1(1).\nThen we can write the set of states as\nS(V ) = {\u03c1 \u2208 V \u2217 | \u03c1 \u2265 0 and Tr(\u03c1) = 1}\nRemember that a morphism \u03c6 between two effect algebras acts on states through\n\u03c1 7\u2192 \u03c1\u25e6\u03c6. This map defines the linear dual \u03c6\u2217 (\u03c1) = \u03c1\u25e6\u03c6. The positivity of \u03c6, which\nis defined by \u03c6(\u03b1) \u2265 0 for all \u03b1 \u2265 0 , is equivalent to \u03c1(\u03c6(\u03b1)) = \u03c6\u2217 (\u03c1)(\u03b1) \u2265 0 for all\nstates \u03c1 and all \u03b1 \u2265 0, which in turns means \u03c6\u2217 (\u03c1) \u2265 0 for all states \u03c1, or simply\nfor all positive functionals \u03c1 \u2265 0. This means that positivity of \u03c6 is equivalent to\nthe positivity of \u03c6\u2217 in terms of the dual order structure. The last defining property\nof \u03c6 is the property \u03c6(1) = 1. Let us see what this means in terms of the dual.\nThis condition is equivalent to \u03c1(\u03c6(1)) = \u03c6\u2217 (\u03c1)(1) = \u03c1(1) for all functionals \u03c1. This\nsimply means that \u03c6\u2217 preserves our notion of trace: Tr(\u03c6\u2217 (\u03c1)) = Tr(\u03c1) for all \u03c1.\nTherefore the action of a morphism on states takes the form of a trace-preserving\npositive linear map.\n\n2.2.4\n\nEffect algebra of a C\u2217 -algebra\n\nBoth quantum and classical sets of propositions have a number of properties in\ncommon beyond the fact that they are effect algebras. First, as suggested above,\ntheir effect algebras are both defined from a vector space, i.e. are linear effect\nalgebras. Again this means that we are given a vector space V , a partial order <\nand a special element e > 0, and that the effect algebra is defined by E = {\u03b1 \u2208\nV | 0 \u2264 \u03b1 \u2264 e}. The additional structure that we will fix can be seen as a way of\nspecifying the partial order relation on our vector space.\nWe will assume that V is a complex vector space, and also has a product between\nelements which make it into an algebra, an involution \u03b1 7\u2192 \u03b1\u2217 which makes it into\na \u2217-algebra, and a norm which satisfies the axioms of a C\u2217 -algebra, namely\nk\u03b1 \u03b2k \u2264 k\u03b1kk\u03b2k and k\u03b1\u2217 \u03b1k = k\u03b1k2 .\n\n\f30\n\nQuantum theory\n\nIn addition we assume that e is the algebraic unit of V . Since it is an algebra, let\nus call our vector space A rather than V . Also we will write 1 instead of e.\nLet us now explain how the partial order is derived from the C\u2217 -algebraic structure. We can define the spectrum \u03c3(\u03b1) of an element \u03b1 \u2208 A by\n\u03c3(\u03b1) = {\u03bb | 1 \u2212 \u03bb\u03b1 has an inverse}\nWe then say that \u03b1 > 0 if \u03b1\u2217 = \u03b1 and \u03c3(\u03b1) \u2286 [0, \u221e). This defines a partial order\nbetween vectors through\n\u03b1<\u03b2\n\nwhen \u03b2 \u2212 \u03b1 > 0.\n\nThis is the partial order which defines the effect algebra associated with our C\u2217 algebra A.\nThe main theorem of the theory of C\u2217 -algebra states that all C\u2217 -algebras can\nbe represented as \u2217-subalgebras of the set B(H) of bounded operators acting on a\nHilbert space H. This is what makes it an appropriate axiomatization for quantum\nmechanics.\nThere is an important physical concept naturally encoded in the structure of\nconcrete C\u2217 -algebras which is not present in the pure effect algebra formalism,\nnamely the notion of independent subsystems. Given two C\u2217 -algebras represented\nas operators on a Hilbert space: A \u2286 B(H) and A0 \u2286 B(H0 ), one has the tensor\nproduct A \u2297 A0 \u2286 B(H \u2297 H0 ) which describes the physical system composed of A\nand A0 . It is the algebra spanned by all pairs of the form \u03b1 \u2297 \u03b10 where \u03b1 \u2208 A and\n\u03b10 \u2208 A0 , with the product defined pairwise: (\u03b1 \u2297 \u03b10 )(\u03b2 \u2297 \u03b2 0 ) = (\u03b1\u03b2) \u2297 (\u03b10 \u03b2 0 ). The\nalgebra A exists within A \u2297 A0 in the form of the operators \u03b1 \u2297 1 where \u03b1 \u2208 A.\nReciprocally, the elements \u03b10 \u2208 A0 are represented in A \u2297 A0 through the operators\n1 \u2297 \u03b10 .\n\n2.3\n\nInfinite-dimensional quantum theory\n\nLet us present a possible way of extending the quantum formalism presented in\nSection 2.1 to infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces. The formalism that we will\npresent is standard, in its most general form, in algebraic quantum field theory,\nbut it also reduces easily to a convenient formalism for non-relativistic quantum\nmechanics.\nA lot of subtleties associated with infinite-dimensional quantum mechanics can\nbe understood as coming from the fact that an infinite-dimensional vector space\nis not isomorphic to its double-dual. This means that we have to be careful in\nchoosing whether we want the states to be functionals on effects, or the effects to\nbe functionals on states.\nIn the following chapters, we will make essential use of sharp effects, i.e. projectors. This implies that we should work not with general C\u2217 -algebras, but instead\n\n\fInfinite-dimensional quantum theory\n\n31\n\nwith their closure in the weak topology, which are von Neumann algebras. Indeed,\nvon Neumann algebras are spanned by their projectors, which implies that many of\ntheir properties can be deduced from the properties of the projectors themselves.\nThe Von Neumann algebras which represent typical classical systems are however rather large. This implies that if we were to assume that states are linear\nfunctionals on the effects, which span the algebra, there would be an awful lot of\nthem. We will see that it is in fact more convenient to assume that the effects are\nfunctionals on states, i.e. that the von Neumann algebra is the dual of the span\nof the set of states. This is where another advantage of von Neumann algebras\nappears: they are always the dual of something, namely a Banach algebra (i.e. a\nC\u2217 -algebra without the axiom which states that k\u03b1\u2217 \u03b1k = k\u03b1k2 ). If A is a von\nNeumann algebra, we will write A\u2217 for its pre-dual, i.e. the Banach algebra which\nis such that (A\u2217 )\u2217 = A.\nFor instance, non-relativistic quantum mechanics can be formalized in a satisfactory way by using for A the set of bounded operators on a separable Hilbert\nspace H, which we write as A = B(H). Its pre-dual can be identified with the\nBanach algebra of trace-class operators A\u2217 = Bt (H). The trace-class operators are\nthe elements A \u2208 B(H) for which the expression\nX \u221a\nhi| A\u2217 A|ii\ni\n\nconverges for any basis |ii. For self-adjoint elements \u03c1 \u2208 Bt (H), this defines the\ntrace\nX\nTr(\u03c1) :=\nhi|\u03c1|ii.\ni\n\nIn fact, the product of an element of \u03c1 \u2208 Bt (H) with any operator A \u2208 B(H) is\nalso trace-class, which implies that we can define Tr(\u03c1A). This is how Bt (H) is\nidentified with (B(H))\u2217 . Indeed, \u03c1 \u2208 Bt (H) defines the functional\nA 7\u2192 Tr(\u03c1A).\nA general von Neumann algebra is equipped with a weak-\u2217 topology, which\namounts to defining the convergence of a sequence An \u2208 B(H) in terms of expectation values. I.e. we say that An converges to A as n \u2192 \u221e if \u03c1(An ) converges to\n\u03c1(A) for all states \u03c1 \u2208 A\u2217 , which makes some physical sense. In the case of B(H),\nthis means that the sequence converges to A if the numbers Tr(\u03c1An ) converge to\nTr(\u03c1A) as n \u2192 \u221e for all states \u03c1 \u2208 Bt (H).\nThis implies that the states represented by elements of Bt (H), seen as linear\nfunctionals of effects, are continuous with respect to the weak-\u2217 topology. Indeed, if the sequence {An }\u221e\nn=1 converges to A in this topology, then, by definition\nTr(\u03c1An ) \u2192 Tr(\u03c1A). Hence the map A 7\u2192 Tr(\u03c1A) is continuous. Conversely, those\nare all the weak-\u2217 continuous positive linear functionals. Therefore, our choice of\nstates corresponds to restricting the natural set of all linear functionals on effects\nto only those which are weak-\u2217 continuous, or normal for short.\n\n\f32\n\nQuantum theory\n\nNote that a von Neumann algebra, when seen as a subalgebra of B(H), also has\nanother weak topology, which is simply called the weak topology. It corresponds\nto defining the limit of operators only in terms of pure states, i.e, we say that An\nconverges weakly to A if h\u03c8|An |\u03c8i converges to h\u03c8|A|\u03c8i for all |\u03c8i \u2208 H. Hence\nconvergence in the weak-\u2217 topology is a stronger condition.\n\n2.3.1\n\nClassical, quantum and hybrid systems\n\nA classical system will be assumed to be specified by a commutative von Neumann algebra, which can always be represented as the algebra L\u221e (\u03a9) of (almost\neverywhere) bounded functions defined on a measure space \u03a9. This set \u03a9 can be\ninterpreted as the phase-space. The fact that \u03a9 is a measure space means that\nfunctions on it can be integrated. The pre-dual, which contains the states, is then\nidentified with the algebra L1 (\u03a9) of absolutely integrable functions on \u03a9. These\nare the functions \u03bc which are such that their absolute value x 7\u2192 |\u03bc(x)| has a finite\nintegral over \u03a9. The state represented by the positive function \u03bc \u2208 L1 (\u03a9) is then\nsimply given, for \u03b1 \u2208 L\u221e (\u03a9), by\nZ\n\u03bc(x) \u03b1(x) dx.\n\u03b1 7\u2192\n\u03a9\n\nThe normalization of the state \u03bc is therefore given by\nZ\n\u03bc(x) dx = 1.\n\u03a9\n\nHence the states are standard continuous probability distributions. We see that this\nformalism only handles probability measures on \u03a9 which are absolutely continuous\nwith respect to the default measure on \u03a9. If we need a more exotic classical state,\nwe may need to take a different \u03a9. For instance if we choose \u03a9 = R with the\nstandard Lebesgue measure, we will not have any discrete probability measure (i.e.\nno delta function). However, we can include them by using instead the disjoint\nunion \u03a9 = R \u222a N.\nA general von Neumann algebra A has a center, denoted by Z(A), which is\nthe commutative subalgebra containing the elements of A which commute with all\nother elements of A. In general, the center of an algebra can be understood as the\n\"classical\" part of the algebra, since it characterizes observables which commute\nwith everything else, and are therefore not subject to any uncertainty relation. In\nthe case of a commutative algebra, this center is obviously the whole algebra.\nFrom this point of view, it makes sense to define a \"pure\" quantum system\nas being defined by an algebra whose center is trivial. The center is trivial if it\ncontains only elements of the form z1, z \u2208 C. Such an algebra is called a factor.\nThere exists three main types of factor. Most of the time we will assume that we\nare working with B(H) which is the most general form of a factor of type I. We note\nthat factors of type II are rarely used in physics, and factors of type III appear in\n\n\fInfinite-dimensional quantum theory\n\n33\n\nalgebraic quantum field theory. Remember however that all von Neumann algebras\ncan be seen as subalgebras of some B(H).\nNote that this formalism, with the physical interpretation based on states and\neffects, works fine even if the von Neumann algebra A is not a factor, nor commutative. In fact we will see that these systems can be decomposed into factors labelled\nby a classical variable. In this sense, they represent hybrid quantum-classical information [39].\nLet us summarize this in a definition:\nDefinition 2.1. A physical model characterized by a von Neumann algebra A\nwill be called classical if A is commutative, quantum if A is a factor and hybrid\notherwise.\nSince all commutative von Neumann algebras are of the form L\u221e (\u03a9), we will\nalways explicitly use this representation for classical systems. Also note that we\nwill in general only be working with factors of type I which are of the form B(H).\nIn addition, we will often assume that H is separable.\nA special case to point out is the von Neumann algebra C which is both commutative and a factor. It has only one state, and therefore represents a system with\nno degree of freedom. It is such that C \u2297 A = A \u2297 C = A for any von Neumann\nalgebra A. Indeed, z \u2297 A = 1 \u2297 zA for any z \u2208 C, which means that C \u2297 A can be\nidentified with A through the map z \u2297 A 7\u2192 zA and its inverse A 7\u2192 1 \u2297 A. The\nsame argument works for A \u2297 C.\nLet us list a few facts about von Neumann algebras that we will use\n\u2022 The commutant of any \"self-adjoint\" set of operators (i.e. closed under the\ndual operation) is a von Neumann algebra [40].\n\u2022 A von Neumann algebra is the norm-closure of the span of its projectors [40].\nThis also implies that it is the weak-\u2217 closure of the span of its projectors.\n\u2022 A commutative von Neumann algebra is always of the form L\u221e (\u03a9) for some\nmeasure space \u03a9 [41].\n\u2022 A factors of type I is isomorphic to B(H) for some Hilbert space H [41].\n\u2022 If H is separable, then Bt (H) is separable [42].\n\n2.3.2\n\nChannels\n\nA communication channel from a system represented by the algebra AA to a system\nrepresented by AB can be defined, as in the finite-dimensional case, by a unital\ncompletely positive linear map\nE \u2217 : AB \u2192 AA\n\n\f34\n\nQuantum theory\n\non effects. However, since we asked for the states to be weak-\u2217 continuous functions,\nwe also need the channels to be weak-\u2217-weak-\u2217 continuous, which we will summarize\nby saying that they are normal. This implies that E \u2217 is always the dual of a linear\nmap\nE : (AA )\u2217 \u2192 (AB )\u2217\nwhich is meant to act on states. As in the finite-dimensional case, it is the map on\nstate E that we will call a channel, while E \u2217 will only be called its dual.\nIf AA = B(HA ) and AB = B(HB ) for some separable Hilbert spaces HA and\nHB , then these maps can be represented as\n\u2217\n\nE (A) =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nEk\u2217 AEk\n\nk=1\n\nand\nE(\u03c1) =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nEk \u03c1Ek\u2217\n\nk=1\n\nwhere the sum can now be infinite [33]. We will call this the Choi-Kraus form of\nthe channel E. The elements Ek are bounded linear operators from HA to HB . This\ncan be understood starting from the Stinespring dilation theorem for completely\npositive maps between C\u2217 -algebras, which states that there is a representation \u03c0 of\nAB on some Hilbert space H, and an isometry V : HB \u2192 H, such that\nE \u2217 (A) = V \u2217 \u03c0(A)V\nfor all A \u2208 AB . Since AB = B(HB ), and E \u2217 is normal, the representation \u03c0 on H is\nof the form \u03c0(A) = A \u2297 1. Also, if HB is separable, then so is H [43]. Therefore the\nsubsystem on which \u03c0(A) acts trivially is also separable, and possesses a discrete\nbasis |ii. This implies that\nX\nE \u2217 (A) = V \u2217 (A \u2297 1)V =\nV \u2217 (A \u2297 |iihi|)V\ni\n\n=\n\nX\n\n(V \u2217 \u2297 |ii)A(V \u2297 hi|).\n\ni\n\nTherefore the elements of the channel E can be chosen to be Ei = V \u2297hi|. Note that\nthis makes it clear that there is a large ambiguity in the choice of the elements Ei .\nIndeed, any orthonormal basis |ii would potentially yield a different set of elements.\nThis definition applies for arbitrary von Neumann algebras AA and AB . In\nparticular, if both are commutative, this simply defines a stochastic map between\nclassical probability distributions.\n\n2.3.3\n\nObservables\n\nGiven that a classical system is also modeled by a von Neumann algebra, we will\nsimply define an observable to be a channel (in the above sense) from a classical\nsystem to a quantum system, i.e.\n\n\fInfinite-dimensional quantum theory\n\n35\n\nx\n\nQ*\n\np\n\nq\n\nFigure 2.1: The classical position observable is defined by the positive map Q\u2217 which\nsends a function on R, which represents a proposition about the position, to a function\non R2 representing a proposition about the full phase-space. The interval on R here\nrepresents the characteristic function for this interval, which is a sharp effect. It is\nmapped to the characteristic function for an infinite stripe in phase-space.\n\nDefinition 2.2. An observable X on the system specified by the algebra A and\nwhich takes values in the measure space \u03a9, is specified by a unital positive normal\nmap X \u2217 : L\u221e (\u03a9) \u2192 A, or equivalently by a trace-preserving positive linear map\nX : A\u2217 \u2192 L1 (\u03a9).\nof which X \u2217 is the dual .\nIn this case the complete positivity comes for free as in the finite-dimensional\ncase [43]. Note that in general, A\u2217 is not equipped with a trace like the one defined\nfor Bt (H). Hence the trace which is preserved in the general case is Tr(\u03c1) := \u03c1(1).\nThis definition also holds when A is commutative, where it defines a classical\nobservable. Note that a classical observable is identical to a classical channel, i.e.\na stochastic map. For instance, consider the case where A = L\u221e (R2 ), which could\ndescribe a single classical particle with phase-space R2 parameterized by positionmomentum pairs (q, p) \u2208 R2 . The position observable is then represented by the\nmap\nQ\u2217 : L\u221e (R) \u2192 L\u221e (R2 )\nwhich sends a function \u03b1 on R to the function \u03b2 = Q(\u03b1) defined by \u03b2(q, p) := \u03b1(q).\nHence it says how a question about position can be translated into a question about\nphase-space (see Figure 2.1).\nThis notion of an observable corresponds only to a subset of the positive operator\nvalued measures. In order to obtain a POVM E from the observable X, it suffices\n\n\f36\n\nQuantum theory\n\nto apply X \u2217 to the characteristic functions \u03c7(\u03c9) of each subsets \u03c9 \u2286 \u03a9. Hence the\nPOVM E corresponding to X is given by\nE(\u03c9) = X \u2217 (\u03c7\u03c9 )\nfor any \u03c9 \u2286 \u03a9. This is indeed a POVM since\n[\nX\nX\nX\nE( \u03c9k ) = X \u2217 (\n\u03c7\u03c9k ) =\nX \u2217 (\u03c7\u03c9k ) =\n(\u03c9k )\nk\n\nk\n\nk\n\nk\n\nfor any disjoint sequence of subsets \u03c9k \u2286 \u03a9, and also\nE(\u03a9) = X \u2217 (1) = 1.\nIn order to see that this does not yield every POVMs, consider the case where A\nis one-dimensional, which is to say A = C. Then a POVM E on \u03a9 with values\nin A = C is any positive measure on \u03a9. Now suppose that X is an observable on\nA = C as defined above. Then it is a linear\nmap from C to L1 (\u03a9), which is just\nR\nan element \u03b1 \u2208 L1 (\u03a9) such that X \u2217 (\u03c7\u03c9 ) = \u03c9 \u03b1(x) dx. Hence X can only represent\nmeasures which are absolutely continuous with respect to the measure associated\nwith \u03a9, contrary to a POVM which could represent any positive measure. This\nmeans in particular that, if we were to take \u03a9 = R then we could not represent\nany discrete POVM. However this can be overcome simply by choosing instead the\ndisjoint union \u03a9 = R \u222a N.\nNote that we could have modeled all POVMs if we did not require that the\nchannel representing the observable be weak-\u2217 continuous. Indeed, a POVM can\nbe seen as a unital positive linear map\nE : C0 (\u03a9) \u2192 A\nwhere C0 (\u03a9) is the C\u2217 -algebra of continuous functions on \u03a9 with compact support\n[43].\nThe fact that our notion of observables is more restrictive than the usual definition in terms of POVM is desired, because it makes the set of all observables\neasier to handle. In particular, if A is finite-dimensional, then the set of all the\nobservables with value in a fixed set \u03a9 is separable.\n\n2.3.4\n\nSharp observables\n\nAs in the finite-dimensional case, an observable X will be called sharp if it maps\nall the sharp classical propositions \u03c7\u03c9 , \u03c9 \u2286 \u03a9 to sharp quantum propositions\n(X \u2217 (\u03c7\u03c9 ))2 = X \u2217 (\u03c7\u03c9 ). This implies that the corresponding POVM is in fact a\nprojection valued measure (PVM). A PVM is also known as an orthogonal partition of the unity. It can always be seen as representing the spectral measure of a\n\n\fInfinite-dimensional quantum theory\n\n37\n\nself-adjoint operator A. If \u03a9 = R, and we define the PVM \u03a0(\u03c9) := X \u2217 (\u03c7\u03c9 ), we\nhave\nZ\nx \u03a0(dx)\nA=\nx\u2208R\n\nThis notation can be understood intuitively as meaning that we define the integral\nas the limit of discrete sums with intervals \u2206x. \u03a0(dx) can then be conceived\nintuitively as the limit of the operators \u03a0(\u2206x).\nIf the sharp observable takes value in a set \u03a9 6= R, representing it as the\nspectral measure of a self-adjoint operator A would require a measure-preserving\nmap f : \u03a9 \u2192 R. We could then write\nZ\nf (x)\u03a0(dx).\nA :=\nx\u2208\u03a9\n\nThis is due to the fact that an observable represented by a self-adjoint operator\ntakes values in its spectrum, which must belong to R. It suffices to think about the\ncase \u03a9 = R2 to realize that the map f can be pretty messy. This shows that the\nformalism of PVMs can be more convenient than that of self-adjoint operators in\nthat it easily allows to talk about observables with non-scalar values.\nConversely, if we are given the self-adjoint operator A, then the corresponding\nPVM is given by the L\u221e (\u03a9) functional calculus of A, where \u03a9 is the spectrum of\nA. This means that for any classical proposition \u03b1 \u2208 L\u221e (\u03a9), we obtain the effect\nX \u2217 (\u03b1) through the relation\nX \u2217 (\u03b1) = \u03b1(A).\nThe map X \u2217 is a von Neumann algebra isomorphism. In particular it satisfies\nX \u2217 (\u03b1\u03b2) = (\u03b1\u03b2)(A) = \u03b1(A)\u03b2(A) = X \u2217 (\u03b1)X \u2217 (\u03b2).\nThe image of X \u2217 is a commutative subalgebra of the von Neumann algebra on\nwhich it is defined, namely the von-Neumann algebra generated by A, which is a\nfaithful representation of the algebra L\u221e (\u03a9).\n\n2.3.5\n\nA category\n\nOne advantage of the formalism chosen is that classical systems and quantum systems are both modeled in the same way, as von Neumann algebras, and all the maps\nof interest are normal completely-positive unital maps between these algebras. In\nthe dual picture, we are working with the pre-duals of von Neumann algebras and\nthe trace-preserving completely positive maps between them. We will generally\nmake use of the maps between pre-duals since they directly say how states evolve.\nIntuitively, the right direction of the flow of information is from states to states.\nIndeed, states represent the information that we, the observers, possess about the\nsystems, and it is our information which flows from one to the other.\n\n\f38\n\nQuantum theory\n\nHence most of our discourse will take place in the category whose objects are\nthe pre-duals of von Neumann algebras, and whose morphisms are trace-preserving\ncompletely positive maps between them [44]. For instance, an observable X of a\nquantum system represented by the Hilbert space H is a morphism\nX-\n\nBt (H)\n\nL1 (\u03a9)\n\nwhere L1 (\u03a9) contains the states of the classical pointer which represents the value\nof the observable. Of course, quantum channels are also morphisms:\nE-\n\nBt (HA )\n\nBt (HB )\n\nStates themselves can be represented by the morphisms\n\u03c1-\n\nC\n\nBt (H)\n\nIndeed, all that this map \u03c1 can do is send each complex number z to z times a fixed\nelement, say \u03c1\u0302, of Bt (H): z 7\u2192 z \u03c1\u0302. Since \u03c1 is positive, \u03c1\u0302 must be a positive operator.\nIn addition, the fact that \u03c1 is trace-preserving implies Tr(z \u03c1\u0302) = zTr(\u03c1\u0302) = Tr(z) = z,\ni.e. Tr(\u03c1\u0302) = 1.\nAs an exercise, note that the trace is the only morphism from Bt (H) to C. It\namounts to erasing all information.\nBt (H)\n\nTr C\n\nEffects can be represented as observables with pointer \u03a9 = {0, 1}, i.e. with target\nL1 ({0, 1}) = L({0, 1}) \u2248 C2 :\nBt (H)\n\nA\n-\n\nL1 ({0, 1})\n\nAt this point we may wonder about the possible meaning of a morphism \u03c6 :\nL (\u03a9) \u2192 Bt (H), i.e. a flow of information from a classical system to a quantum\nsystem. Since it is linear it must be defined by its action on a basis of L1 (\u03a9).\nConsider for instance the case where \u03a9 is finite. Then a basis is given by the pure\nstates \u03c7i (j) = \u03b4ij for all i, j \u2208 \u03a9. Since these functions are states, the images are\nquantum states \u03c1i := \u03c6(\u03c7i ) which are completely arbitrary. Hence \u03c6 is a statepreparation device. It encodes classical information into a quantum system by\ndirectly mapping the pure classical states into arbitrary quantum states:\n1\n\nL1 (\u03a9)\n\n\u03c6-\n\nBt (H)\n\nThe composition of a state preparation and an observation yields a channel\nbetween two classical systems:\nL1 (\u03a9A )\n\n\u03c6-\n\nBt (H)\n\nX-\n\nL1 (\u03a9B )\n\n\fSummary\n\n39\n\nHybrid\nAlgebra is ...\narbitrary\ndimension\narbitrary\nAlgebra\nA, B, . . .\nPre-dual\nA\u2217 , B\u2217 , . . .\nEffects\nE(A), E(B), . . .\nStates\nS(A), S(B), . . .\n\nClassical\nQuantum\ncommutative\nfactor of type I\nfinite arbitrary finite arbitrary\nL(\u03a9) L\u221e (\u03a9) M(H)\nB(H)\n1\nL(\u03a9)\nL (\u03a9)\nM(H)\nBt (H)\nE(\u03a9)\nE(H)\nS(\u03a9)\nS(H)\n\nTable 2.1: Summary of the symbols used for sets of propositions and states.\nwhich is simply a stochastic process mapping a probability distribution on \u03a9A into\na probability distribution on \u03a9B .

Effects\nrepresent elementary propositions and states assign a probability to each effects.\nIn both the quantum and classical cases, the effects can be seen as elements of a\nC\u2217 -algebra. The essential aspect of these algebras, for our purpose, is the fact that\nthey are ordered vector spaces, i.e. vector spaces with a suitably compatible partial\norder. The effects are those vectors which are larger than zero and smaller than 1.\nFor our purposes, it is convenient to assume that the C\u2217 -algebras have a pre-dual,\nwhich means that they are von-Neumann algebras. We then restrict states to those\nfunctionals which live in the pre-dual. Table 2.1 summarizes some of our notations.\nA transfer of information, or channel, from system A to system B is represented\nby a map from the states of A to the states of B, whose dual is a unital completelypositive map from effects of B to effects of A. For clarity, it is always the map on\nstates which will be referred to as the channel, since it goes in the direction which\nwe intuitively associate with the direction of the flow of information.\nA quantum observable, or observable for short, is a channel from a quantum\nto a classical system. The classical system can be interpreted as that part of a\nmeasurement apparatus which displays the result of the measurement. This notion\nof an observable is essentially equivalent to that of a POVM, although slightly more\nrestrictive.\n\n\f\fChapter 3\nPreserved information\nRecall that our aim is to characterize decoherence through the type of information\nflowing between a system and its environment, or within the system. Therefore, we\nneed a way to formally talk in detail about the nature of the information preserved\nby a quantum channel. In this chapter, we introduce the main new concept that we\nwill be using, and derive a number of basic results about it. Although our results\nare based on many known results, mostly in the theory of quantum error correction,\nwe will present them in a logical, rather than a historical order. Hence we will not\nmention the known results here, but instead show how to derive them from our\nmore general point of view in the next chapter.\nThe main definition that we will be playing with is the following:\nDefinition 3.1. An observable X is said to be preserved by a channel E if there\nexists an observable Y such that X = Y \u25e6 E. We write PE for the set of observables\npreserved by E.\nRecall that the equation X = Y \u25e6 E means that X is the image of Y in the\nHeisenberg picture (see Section 2.1.5). For a discrete observable with elements Xi\nand Yi , this means that Xi = E \u2217 (Yi ) for all i. If \u03a9 is the set of values of X, we\nhave:\nA1\n\nE\n-\n\nA2\nY\n\nX\n-\n\n?\n\nL1 (\u03a9)\nHence, for any state of system A, measuring Y on system B yields the same result\n(i.e. the same probability distribution on \u03a9) as measuring X on the initial system\nA. This justifies the idea that the information about A represented by X has been\npreserved by the channel E: we can perfectly simulate an observation of X on the\ninitial state by observing Y after the action of the channel.\n41\n\n\f42\n\nPreserved information\n\nIf the observable X is sharp, we know that it can also be represented by a selfb As an example, suppose that this observable has a discrete\nadjoint operator X.\nb = P xi Pi where xi is the eigenvalue\nspectrum. This implies that it is of the form X\ni\ncorresponding to the spectral projection Pi . In this case, X is preserved\nif Pi =\nP\n\u2217\nE (Yi ) for all i, where the effects Yi form a discrete observable, i.e. i Yi = 1.\nb = E \u2217 (Yb ) for some self-adjoint operator Yb .\nIt is not sufficient to require that X\nb is preserved for any\nIndeed, this equation only means that the first moment of X\nb\nb\nstate \u03c1: Tr(\u03c1X) = Tr(E(\u03c1)Y ). On the other hand, if we require that Pi = E \u2217 (Yi ) for\nb n = P xni Pi ,\nall i, then all the moments of X are preserved. Indeed, for any n, X\ni\nfrom which it is easy to see that also\nb n ) = Tr(E(\u03c1)Yb n )\nTr(\u03c1X\nfor any n.\nNote that we can also define the moments of any scalar (and possible unsharp)\nobservable X defined by\nZ\n\u2217\nX (\u03b1) =\n\u03b1(x) Xx dx\nR\n\nwhere Xx are operators, and \u03b1 a real function. The nth moment of X can be\nrepresented by the operator\nZ\ncn :=\nxn Xx dx.\nX\nR\n\nIndeed, we have\nZ\ncn ) =\nTr(\u03c1X\n\nn\n\nZ\n\nx Tr(\u03c1Xx ) dx =\nR\n\nxn X(\u03c1)(x)dx\n\nR\n\ncn on \u03c1 yields the nth moment\nThis equation means that the expectation value of X\nof the probability distribution X(\u03c1). If X is preserved, then so are its moments, in\ncn = E \u2217 (Ycn ) for all n.\nthe sense that X\nConsider the case of yes-no observables, i.e. observables with two outcomes,\nwhich are one-to-one with effects. If X0 and X1 are the two elements characterizing\na yes-no observable, we must have X0 + X1 = 1, which implies X1 = 1 \u2212 X0 . This\nobservable is preserved by the channel E when there exists another yes-no observable\nY such that X0 = E \u2217 (Y0 ) and X1 = E \u2217 (Y1 ). However the second equation is redundant. Indeed, this first equation implies E \u2217 (Y1 ) = E \u2217 (1 \u2212 Y0 ) = E \u2217 (1) \u2212 E \u2217 (Y0 ) =\n1\u2212X0 = X1 . Therefore, the preserved yes-no observables are characterized by what\nwe define as the preserved effects, namely the effects which are image of another\neffect under E \u2217 .\nDefinition 3.2. An effect A \u2208 E(A1 ) is preserved by E : A1 \u2192 A2 if there exists\nB \u2208 E(A2 ) such that A = E \u2217 (B). Hence, the set of preserved effects is E \u2217 (E(A2 )).\n\n\fA set of observables?\n\n43\n\nA general preserved observable X satisfies X \u2217 = E \u2217 \u25e6 Y \u2217 , which means that for\nany classical proposition \u03b1, X \u2217 (\u03b1) = E \u2217 (Y \u2217 (\u03b1)). Hence all the effects X \u2217 (\u03b1) associated with the observable X are individually preserved by the map E. For a discrete\nobservable X, this means that any sum of its elements belongs to E \u2217 (E(A2 )).\n\n3.1\n\nA set of observables?\n\nWe introduced a notion of preserved observable, and therefore also a notion of\npreserved effect. Since preserved observables are made of preserved effects, we may\nwonder if we could limit the discussion to the set of preserved effects, which are\nsimpler objects. In addition, the set of preserved effects is an effect algebra, which\ncan be understood as defining an effective physical system of its own, as discussed\nin Section 2.2.\nHowever, the set of preserved effects, although it certainly gives interesting\ninformation about the channel, does not always contain as much information as\nthe set of preserved observables. Indeed, it is not always true that a preserved\nobservable is characterized by preserved effects. A counter example is given in\nSection 3.1.1 below.\nHowever it is true in the \"generic case\", when the channel has no kernel:\nProposition 3.1. If the channel E : A1 \u2192 A2 is invertible, then the two following\nstatements are equivalent\n1. The observable X is preserved by E,\n2. X \u2217 (\u03b1) \u2208 E \u2217 (E(A2 )) for all \u03b1.\nProof. We have already shown above that Statement 1 implies Statement 2. Conversely, suppose that X \u2217 (\u03b1) \u2208 E \u2217 (E(A2 )) for all \u03b1. Let \u03c6 := (E \u2217 )\u22121 \u25e6 X \u2217 . We have\nto show that the linear map \u03c6 is positive and unital. Since E \u2217 is invertible, its range\nis the whole positive cone of A2 and its inverse maps the positive cone of A2 to\nthat of A1 , which means that it is also positive. Given that X \u2217 itself is positive, \u03c6\nis positive. In addition we have that (E \u2217 )\u22121 (1) = 1, which implies \u03c6(1) = 1.\n\n3.1.1\n\nA counter-example\n\nLet us now give an example of a channel, together with an observable which is not\npreserved but which is made of preserved effects. We consider a channel of the form\nE : M(C3 ) \u2192 M(C4 ).\n\n\f44\n\nPreserved information\n\nLet |ii, i = 1, . . . , 4 denotes a basis of C4 . For convenience, we will use its first three\nelements |ii for i = 1, . . . , 3 to define a basis of C3 too. Also, we write Pi := |iihi|.\nWe define E by\n3\n1X\n2\nE(\u03c1) :=\n|iihi|\u03c1|iihi| + Tr(\u03c1)P4\n3 i=1\n3\nIt is easy to see that this map is completely positive. Indeed the P\nfirst term already\n2\nhas the Choi-Kraus form, and the second term can be written as 3 3i=1 |4ihi|\u03c1|iih4|.\nAlso it is trace-preserving. Indeed,\n3\n\n1X\n2\nTr(E(\u03c1)) =\nhi|\u03c1|ii + Tr(\u03c1)\n3 i=1\n3\n1\n2\n= Tr(\u03c1) + Tr(\u03c1) = Tr(\u03c1).\n3\n3\nThe dual is\n3\n\nE \u2217 (A) =\n\n2\n1X\n|iihi|A|iihi| + h4|A|4i13\n3 i=1\n3\n\nNow consider the discrete observable X on C3 with elements\n1\n1\nX1 = (P2 + P3 ) + 1\n3\n3\n1\nX2 = (P1 + P3 )\n3\n1\nX3 = (P1 + P2 )\n3\nThese elements are clearly positive and sum to the identity:\nX\ni\n\nXi =\n\n2X\n1\nPi + 1 3 = 1 3 .\n3 i\n3\n\nIn addition, any sums of the elements Xi are inside E \u2217 (E(C4 )). To see this it is\nuseful to note that E \u2217 , viewed as a linear map, has a kernel which is generated by\n1\nK = P1 + P2 + P3 \u2212 P4 .\n2\nSince E \u2217 (K) = 0, we can subtract any multiple of K in the argument of E \u2217 in order\nto make sure that the argument is an effect. If we define the effects\n1\nY10 := P2 + P3 + P4\n2\nY20 := P1 + P3\nY30 := P1 + P2\n\n\fA set of observables?\n\n45\n\nthen we have Xi = E \u2217 (Yi0 ) and also\nX1 + X2 = E \u2217 (Y10 + Y20 \u2212 K) = E \u2217 (P2 + P4 )\n1\nX2 + X3 = E \u2217 (Y20 + Y30 \u2212 K) = E \u2217 (P1 + P4 )\n2\nX1 + X3 = E \u2217 (Y10 + Y30 \u2212 K) = E \u2217 (P2 + P4 )\n\nThis suffices to show that X \u2217 (\u03b1) \u2208 E \u2217 (E(C4 )) for any \u03b1. However, the observable\nX as a whole is not preserved by the channel E. In order for it to be preserved,\nwe would need to find another observable Y with elements Yi , i = 1, . . . , 3 such\nthat Xi = E \u2217 (Yi ) for all i. We note that the effects Yi0 cannot serve this purpose\nbecause\nthey fail to sum to the identity:\nP 0 they do not form an 1observable. Indeed\n1\ni Yi = 2P1 + 2P2 + 2P3 + 2 P4 = 214 \u2212 2 P4 . If we wish to modify these three\noperators while maintaining their images under E \u2217 , the only thing we can do is add\nor subtract different multiples of K to each of them. However it is easy to see that\nthis cannot be done without getting them out of the set of effects E(C4 ). Indeed,\nnote that they are all diagonal operators, hence the diagonal coefficient are the\neigenvalues. It is easy to see that adding or subtracting any amount of K to any\nof them would set some diagonal elements either smaller that 0 or larger than 1,\nwhich would mean that they are not effects anymore.\nNote that this example is entirely classical since all the operators involved are\ncodiagonal. Therefore the counter example also applies to classical channels.\n\n3.1.2\n\nPreserved effective theory\n\nAs mentioned above, the set of effects preserved by a channel is an effect algebra. It\ncan be understood as defining an effective physical system, namely a \"subsystem\"-\nin a very general sense-of the initial quantum system. When the channel is invertible, this subsystem has a true operational existence as it effectively models\nthe experimentally accessible degrees of freedom of the system filtered through the\nnoise represented by the channel.\nHowever, the above counter-example shows that for more general channels, some\nof the observables represented by this set of effects cannot in fact be measured (are\nnot themselves preserved). This implies that, in principle, we should use a more\ngeneral framework than that of an effect algebra, and define a physical theory\ndirectly by a set of general observables.\nThis explains why, in the rest of this thesis, we will always take the set of\npreserved observable as the fundamental object of study, and reduce it to effects\nonly when possible.\n\n\f46\n\n3.2\n\nPreserved information\n\nSharp preserved observables\n\nIn this section we will consider a quantum channel E : Bt (H1 ) \u2192 Bt (H2 ). We will\nalso assume that H1 is separable. We saw in Section 2.3.2 that such a channel can\nalways be represented in terms of a countable family of channel elements Ek , as\nX\nE \u2217 (B) =\nEk\u2217 BEk\nk\n\nwhere the sum converges in the weak-\u2217 topology. Note that from now on, all sums\nof operators will be assumed to be at most countably infinite, and convergent in\nthe weak-\u2217 topology.\nLet us consider the sharp preserved effects, i.e. those which belong to E \u2217 (E(H2 )).\nA sharp effect P \u2208 E(H1 ) is a an effect which is also a projection, i.e. P 2 = P . If\nit is preserved, then there is an effect B \u2208 E(H2 ) such that\nP = E \u2217 (B).\n\n(3.1)\n\nIn order to characterize the sharp preserved effects, we want to obtain an equivalent\ncondition which involves only the channel elements Ek .\nFirst, let us state a simple technical lemma that we will use several times:\nP \u2217\nLemma 3.2. If\nk Fk BFk = 0 for some positive operator B and a family of\noperators Fk , then BFk = 0 for all k.\nProof. For any vector |\u03c8i, we have\nX \u221a\nX\nX\n\u221a \u2217\u221a\nk BFk |\u03c8ik2 = 0.\nh\u03c8|Fk\u2217 BFk |\u03c8i =\nh\u03c8|Fk\u2217 B BFk |\u03c8i =\nk\n\nk\n\nk\n\n\u221a\nThis\nimplies\nthat\neach\npositive\nterm\nk\nBFk |\u03c8ik2 in\n\u221a the sum is zero. Therefore\n\u221a\nBFk |\u03c8i = 0 for any vector |\u03c8i, which means that BFk = 0.\nWe could apply this lemma to Equation 3.1 if we had a zero on the left-hand\nside of the equation. This is the case if we multiply this term by P \u22a5 = 1 \u2212 P .\nIndeed P \u22a5 P = (1 \u2212 P )P = P \u2212 P 2 = P \u2212 P = 0. But we want the right-hand side\nterm to be positive for the trick to work, therefore we multiply by P \u22a5 from both\nsides:\nP \u22a5 E \u2217 (B)P \u22a5 = P \u22a5 P P \u22a5 = 0\nApplying Lemma 3.2 we get BEk (1 \u2212 P ) = 0 for all k, i.e.\nBEk = BEk P.\n\n(3.2)\n\nThere is another similar equation that we can use. For every preserved effect P we\nget another preserved effect for free, namely its orthocomplement: 1 \u2212 P . Indeed,\n\n\fSharp preserved observables\n\n47\n\nE \u2217 (1 \u2212 B) = 1 \u2212 E \u2217 (B) = 1 \u2212 P , and 1 \u2212 B is a valid effect. Using the same\nargument as above, we obtain (1 \u2212 B)Ek P = 0, i.e.\nEk P = BEk P.\n\n(3.3)\n\nCombining Equations 3.2 and 3.3, we get\nBEk = Ek P.\n\n(3.4)\n\nThis means than the existence of an effect B which is such that BEk = Ek P for all\nchannel elements Ek is a necessary condition for P to be preserved by the channel.\nIn fact, it is easy to see that this condition is sufficient. Indeed, if BEk = Ek P ,\nthen\nX\nX\nE \u2217 (B) =\nEk\u2217 BEk =\nEk\u2217 Ek P = E \u2217 (1)P = P.\nk\n\nk\n\nWe achieved obtaining a condition which depends on each channel elements\nEk independently, rather than on the whole channel. However, if we really want\na useful characterization of the sharp preserved effects, we need to eliminate any\nreference to the unknown operator B. First note that by taking the adjoint of\nEquation 3.4 we obtain Ek\u2217 B = P Ek\u2217 . Together with Equation 3.4, this implies\nEk\u2217 Ej P = Ek\u2217 BEj = P Ek\u2217 Ej .\nThis is a necessary condition for P to be preserved, which does not involve the\nunknown effect B. In fact, this condition is sufficient.\nP\nTheorem 3.3. A sharp effect P is preserved by the channel E(\u03c1) = k Ek \u03c1Ek\u2217 if\nand only if\n[P, Ei\u2217 Ej ] = 0 for all i,j.\n(3.5)\nProof. We have already proven the necessity. In order to prove the sufficiency, we\nwill use this condition to build the effect B of which P is the image. We will need\nthe completely positive map E\u03bb defined by\nE\u03bb (A) :=\n\n\u221e\nX\n\n\u03bbi Ei AEi\u2217\n\n(3.6)\n\ni=0\n\nwhere \u03bbi := 2\u2212i . This choice of \u03bb guarantees that the sum converges in norm for any\neffect A since kEi AEi\u2217 k \u2264 1. In fact, any choice of components \u03bbi > 0 which makes\nthis sum weak-\u2217 convergent for any effect A would be sufficient for our purpose.\nNote that if \u03bbi = 1 for all i, then E\u03bb = E, which is defined only on trace-class\noperators.\nWe will try the ansatz\nB := (E\u03bb (1))\u22121 E\u03bb (P ).\n\n(3.7)\n\nFirst, we have to show that E\u03bb (1) can indeed be inverted. Note that E\u03bb (1)|\u03c8i = 0\nif and only if h\u03c8|E\u03bb (1)|\u03c8i = 0 since it is positive. If we write the channel in terms\n\n\f48\n\nPreserved information\n\nof the elements Ek , we obtain a sum of positive terms which must all be equal to\nzero: h\u03c8|Ei Ei\u2217 |\u03c8i = 0. Hence Ei\u2217 |\u03c8i = 0 for all i. This means that if |\u03c8i is in the\nkernel of E\u03bb (1), it must be in the kernel of each Ei\u2217 , and therefore be orthogonal to\nthe range of each Ei . This shows that we can invert E\u03bb (1) on the range of any of\nthe operators Ei . In the following we will always be able to assume that (E\u03bb (1))\u22121\noperates on the span of the ranges of the operators Ei . In particular, Equation 3.7\nis well-defined.\nNow that we have defined B, let us check that E \u2217 (B) = P . We have\nBEi = (E\u03bb (1))\u22121 E\u03bb (P )Ei\nX\n= (E\u03bb (1))\u22121\n\u03bbk Ek P Ek\u2217 Ei\nk\n\u22121\n\n= (E\u03bb (1))\n\nX\n\n\u03bbk Ek Ek\u2217 Ei P\n\nk\n\u22121\n\n= (E\u03bb (1)) E\u03bb (1)Ei P = Ei P\nwhich is Equation 3.4 and proves that E \u2217 (B) = PP. However we have\nthat\nP to check\n\u2217\n\u2217\nB is an effect. Note that BEi = Ei P implies i \u03bbi BEi Ei = i \u03bbi Ei P Ei , i.e.,\nBE\u03bb (1) = E\u03bb (P ), which implies B = E\u03bb (P )(E\u03bb (1))\u22121 . From the definition of B, we\nalso have B = (E\u03bb (1))\u22121 E\u03bb (P ). Hence [(E\u03bb (1))\u22121 , E\u03bb (P )] = 0, which implies that\n1\n\n1\n\nB = E\u03bb (1)\u2212 2 E\u03bb (P )E\u03bb (1)\u2212 2 \u2265 0\n1\n\n(3.8)\n\n1\n\nIn addition, B \u2264 E\u03bb (1)\u2212 2 1E\u03bb (1)\u2212 2 = 1, which shows that it is an effect.\nThe dependence of B on P in the above proof is in fact given by the dual of a\ncompletely positive trace-preserving map, i.e. a channel. Explicitly, this channel is\n1\n\n1\n\nR(\u03c1) = E\u03bb\u2217 (E\u03bb (1)\u2212 2 \u03c1 E\u03bb (1)\u2212 2 )\nand its dual\n\n1\n\n(3.9)\n\n1\n\nR\u2217 (A) = E\u03bb (1)\u2212 2 E\u03bb (A)E\u03bb (1)\u2212 2 .\nWe will see in Chapter 4 that this channel R is the \"correction\" channel of the\ntheory of quantum error correction. This particular way of writing it appeared\nbefore in [45] for the case \u03bbi = 1 which works when H1 is finite-dimensional.\nTheorem 3.3 yields also some unsharp preserved effects. Indeed, given the linearity of E \u2217 , if two effects are preserved, then so is any of their convex combinations\n(which are also effects). Therefore, the convex hull of the preserved projectors is\nentirely preserved. In fact, the continuity of this channel implies that the weak-\u2217\nclosure of this convex hull is also preserved.\nConsider the commutant AE of the operators Ei\u2217 Ej , i.e. the set of operators\nwhich commute with them. This set is clearly an algebra. In fact, it is a von\nNeumann algebra, which always has the property that the set of effects it contains\nis the closed convex full of its projectors [46]. Since all the projectors in AE are\npreserved, then so are all the effects it contains. This proves the following:\n\n\fSharp preserved observables\n\n49\n\nCorollary 3.4. The set of effects spanning the von Neumann algebra\nAE = {A \u2208 B(H1 ) | [A, Ei\u2217 Ej ] = 0 for all i,j}\nare all preserved by E. In addition, this algebra contains all the preserved sharp\neffects.\nWe can now easily generalize Theorem 3.3 to all sharp observables.\nTheorem 3.5. A sharp observable X is preserved by the channel E if and only if\nX \u2217 (\u03b1) \u2208 AE\n\nfor all \u03b1\n\n(3.10)\n\nProof. The necessity of this condition follows from the fact that if X is preserved,\nthen there is an observable Y such that X \u2217 (\u03b1) = E \u2217 (Y \u2217 (\u03b1)) for all \u03b1, which implies\nin particular that all the sharp effects X \u2217 (\u03c7\u03c9 ) for \u03c9 \u2286 \u03a9 are preserved by E, and\ntherefore belong to AE . Since the unsharp effects X \u2217 (\u03b1) all belong to the von\nNeumann algebra generated by the sharp effects X \u2217 (\u03c7\u03c9 ), we also have X \u2217 (\u03b1) \u2208\nAE for all \u03b1. Conversely, consider the channel Y := X \u25e6 R, which is clearly an\nobservable. If X \u2217 (\u03c7\u03c9 ) \u2208 AE for all \u03c9, then we know that X \u2217 (\u03c7\u03c9 ) = E \u2217 (Y \u2217 (\u03c7\u03c9 )) for\nall \u03c9. By linearity and continuity of E \u2217 , X \u2217 (\u03b1) = E \u2217 (Y \u2217 (\u03b1)) for all \u03b1.\nThis theorem yields a direct interpretation of the whole algebra AE if we represent the sharp observables by self-adjoint operators in the traditional manner.\nIndeed, remember that we can represent a sharp observable X by the (possibly\nb whose spectral projection-valued measure is\nunbounded) self-adjoint operator X\n\u2217\n\u03c9 7\u2192 X (\u03c7\u03c9 ). They are related through the equation\nb\nX \u2217 (\u03b1) = \u03b1(X)\nb\nwhich involves the functional calculus on X.\nCorollary 3.6. A sharp observable represented by the bounded self-adjoint operator\nb is preserved by the channel E if and only if\nX\nb \u2208 AE .\nX\nb = X.\nb Conversely, if X\nb \u2208 AE ,\nProof. If X is preserved, then AE 3 X \u2217 (id) = id(X)\nb \u2208 AE for all \u03b1.\nthen X \u2217 (\u03b1) = \u03b1(X)\nWe have not yet discussed the properties of the operators B obtained by Equation 3.8. In fact they are projectors. Indeed, remember that B = E\u03bb (1)\u22121 E\u03bb (P ) =\nE\u03bb (P )E\u03bb (1)\u22121 . Therefore\nB 2 = E\u03bb (1)\u22121 E\u03bb (P )E\u03bb (P )E\u03bb (1)\u22121\n= E\u03bb (1)\u22121 E\u03bb (1)E\u03bb (P 2 )E\u03bb (1)\u22121\n= E\u03bb (P 2 )E\u03bb (1)\u22121\n= E\u03bb (P )E\u03bb (1)\u22121 = B.\nThis can be used to show that\n\n\f50\n\nPreserved information\n\nProposition 3.7. A preserved sharp observable is always the image of a sharp\nobservable.\nProof. Remember that if the sharp observable X is preserved, then it is the image\n1\n1\nof the observable Y given by Y \u2217 (\u03b1) = R\u2217 (X \u2217 (\u03b1)) = E\u03bb (1)\u2212 2 E\u03bb (X \u2217 (\u03b1))E\u03bb (1)\u2212 2 .\nFrom the above observation, we know that since X \u2217 (\u03c7\u03c9 ) is a projector for any\nsubset \u03c9 \u2286 \u03a9, then so is Y \u2217 (\u03c7\u03c9 ), which proves that Y is sharp.\n\n3.3\n\nOutgoing information\n\nIf the evolution in time of a quantum system is given by a channel\nE : Bt (H1 ) \u2192 Bt (H2 )\nwhich is not unitary, then it means that the system is interacting with an \"environment\". The environment can be any other quantum system, the state of which\nwe have ignored in our description. This fact is reflected in the Stinespring dilation\ntheorem [43], which states that a completely positive map as above can always be\nrepresented (via its dual) as\nE \u2217 (A) = V \u2217 (A \u2297 1)V\n\n(3.11)\n\nwhere V is a bounded operator\nV : H1 \u2192 H2 \u2297 HE\nsuch that V \u2217 V = 1, i.e. an isometry. Here HE can be interpreted as the Hilbert\nspace of the environment. The Choi-Kraus representation of the channel follows\nfrom this theorem by noting that, for any orthonormal basis |ii of the environment,\nX\nX\nE \u2217 (A) =\nV \u2217 (A \u2297 |iihi|)V =\nV \u2217 (1 \u2297 |ii)A(1 \u2297 hi|)V\ni\n\ni\n\nHence the channel elements of E are\nEi = (1 \u2297 hi|)V\nwhich means that\nE(\u03c1) =\n\nX\n\nEi \u03c1Ei\u2217 =\n\ni\n\nX\n(1 \u2297 hi|)V AV \u2217 (1 \u2297 |ii)\ni\n\n= TrE (V AV \u2217 )\nwhere we have introduced the channel\nTrE : Bt (H2 \u2297 HE ) \u2212\u2192 Bt (H2 )\n\n(3.12)\n\n\fOutgoing information\n\nSys\n\n51\n\nSys\n\nEnv\n(Env)\n\nE\n\n=\n\nU\n\n(Sys)\n\nU\n\n\u03c8\nSys\n\nEnv\n\nEc\n\n=\n\n\u03c8\n\nSys\n\nSys\n\nSys\n\nFigure 3.1: Dilation of the channel E, and of the complementary channel Ec , represented\nas circuit diagrams. |\u03c8i is the initial state of the environement, and U the unitary operator\nrepresenting the joint evolution of the system and its environement. The horizontal bar\nending a vertical line represents a partial trace.\n\ndefined by\nTrE (\u03c1) =\n\nX\n\n(1 \u2297 hi|)\u03c1(1 \u2297 |ii).\n\ni\n\nThis channel is called a partial trace, here taken over the environment HE . It\ncorresponds to the action of \"erasing\" any information about the system HE . Its\ndual, which we implicitly used above, is the ampliation map\nTr\u2217E : B(H2 ) \u2212\u2192 B(H2 \u2297 HE )\nA 7\u2212\u2192 A \u2297 1\nIt says how an effect of H2 can be also seen as an effect of H2 \u2297 HE .\nPhysically, suppose that the environment starts in a known state |\u03c8E i, and\nthat the two evolve according to the joint unitary operator U , i.e. \u03c1 \u2297 |\u03c8E ih\u03c8E |\nevolves to U (\u03c1 \u2297 |\u03c8E ih\u03c8E |)U \u2217 . Since the initial state of the environment is fixed,\nand uncorrelated with \u03c1, we can view this simply as a map on \u03c1 \u2208 Bt (H1 ), with\ntarget in Bt (H2 \u2297 HE ):\n\u03c1 7\u2212\u2192 U (\u03c1 \u2297 |\u03c8E ih\u03c8E |)U \u2217 = U (1 \u2297 |\u03c8E i)\u03c1(1 \u2297 h\u03c8E |)U \u2217\n(See figure 3.1.) This gives a physical interpretation to the isometry\nV := U (1 \u2297 |\u03c8E i).\nTo check that this is indeed an isometry, note that V \u2217 V = (1 \u2297 h\u03c8E |)U \u2217 U (1 \u2297\n|\u03c8E i) = 1h\u03c8E |\u03c8E i = 1.\nThe operation which consists in taking the partial trace over the environment\nmeans that we ignore its state for the calculation of any further expectation value,\n\n\f52\n\nPreserved information\n\nor probability. Indeed, if, after the interaction, we only plan to measure observables\nof the system, which are of the form A \u2297 1, then all expectation values take the\nform\nTr(V \u03c1V \u2217 (A \u2297 1)) = Tr(TrE (V \u03c1V \u2217 )A).\nThis interpretation is also straightforward if we stick to the Heisenberg picture,\nwhere the form E \u2217 (A) = V \u2217 (A \u2297 1)V directly implies that we are only worrying\nabout observables of the form A \u2297 1 on the final joint state of the system and\nenvironment.\nThe characterization of the preserved sharp observables, derived in the previous\nsection, can also naturally be expressed in terms of the isometry V rather than in\nterms of the channel elements Ek . Remember that the preserved observables are\nthose which commute with the operators Ei\u2217 Ej for all i and j. Using Equation 3.12,\nwe have\nEi\u2217 Ej = V \u2217 (1 \u2297 |iihj|)V.\nHence the span of the operators Ei\u2217 Ej is simply V \u2217 (1 \u2297 B(HE ))V . This means that\na sharp effect P is preserved by E if and only if\n[P, V \u2217 (1 \u2297 B)V ] = 0\n\nfor all B \u2208 B(HE ).\n\n(3.13)\n\nIn fact, the effects of the form V \u2217 (1 \u2297 B)V have an important physical meaning.\nIndeed, they are preserved by the channel Ec defined by its dual\nEc\u2217 (B) := V \u2217 (1 \u2297 B)V.\nThis channel Ec is called the complementary channel to E. As E maps H1 to H2 ,\nEc maps H1 to HE . It tells what information flows from the initial states of the\nsystem H1 to the environment HE . Indeed, the effects of the form Ec\u2217 (B) \u2208 B(H1 )\ncan be simulated by measuring B on the final state of the environment.\nThis gives us directly an interpretation for Equation 3.13:\nCorollary 3.8. A sharp observable is preserved by E if and only if it commutes\nwith all the effects preserved by the complementary channel Ec . Hence, the preserved\nalgebra AE is given by\nAE = {A | [A, B] = 0 for all B \u2208 Ec\u2217 (E(HE )) }.\nIn particular, this implies that the sharp observables preserved by E all commute\nwith the sharp observables preserved by Ec . Hence the algebra\nCE := AE \u2229 AEc\nis commutative and therefore characterizes an effective classical system with phasespace \u03a9 such that\nCE = L\u221e (\u03a9).\n\n\fExample: measurements\n\n53\n\nThis is a detailed form of the no-broadcasting theorem, which is a stronger\nversion of the no-cloning theorem. Indeed, the algebra CE characterizes the sharp\nobservables representing information which has been preserved in the system and\nat the same time transfered to the environment. Therefore this information is\naccessible from two different systems. This means that it has been at best broadcast\n(if there are correlations) and at worst cloned (if there are no correlations). Hence,\nthe fact that CE is commutative means that the sharp information which is broadcast\nmust always be classical.\nWe will argue in Section 5.2 that this gives a way in which a classical system\ncan emerge within a completely quantum system. Here the classical system is\ncharacterized by the only sharp information which is broadcast by an arbitrary\nquantum interaction. A generalization of this result to unsharp observables will be\nthe basis of our picture of decoherence, presented in Section 5.5.\n\n3.4\n\nExample: measurements\n\nExamples involving sharp observables will be given in the context of quantum error\ncorrection in Chapter 4.1. Since most results presented in this chapter concern\nonly sharp observables, let us give here some examples involving unsharp preserved\nobservables.\nConsider a channel on B(H) of the form1\nX\nE(\u03c1) =\n\u03bbk |\u03c8k ih\u03c8k |\u03c1|\u03c8k ih\u03c8k |\nk\n\nwhere the states |\u03c8k i are normalized, but need not be orthogonal to each other.\nThis channel maps an observable Y with values in \u03a9 to the observable X = Y \u25e6 E.\nExplicitly,\nX \u2217 (\u03b1) = E \u2217 (Y \u2217 (\u03b1))\nX\n=\n\u03bbi |\u03c8i ih\u03c8i |Y \u2217 (\u03b1)|\u03c8i ih\u03c8i |\ni\n\n=\n\nX\n\n\u03bbi h\u03c8i |Y \u2217 (\u03b1)|\u03c8i i|\u03c8i ih\u03c8i |\n\ni\n\nfor all classical effects \u03b1 \u2208 L\u221e (\u03a9). By construction, X \u2217 is preserved by E. In fact,\nit is also preserved by the complementary channel Ec . Using a basis {|ii}i of H, we\ncan write the complementary channel as\nXp\nEc\u2217 (B) =\n\u03bbi \u03bbj |\u03c8i ih\u03c8i |kihi|B|jihk|\u03c8j ih\u03c8j |\nijk\n\nXp\n=\n\u03bbi \u03bbj hi|B|ji|\u03c8i ih\u03c8i |\u03c8j ih\u03c8j |.\nij\n1\n\nThis is an example of an entanglement-breaking channel\n\n\f54\n\nPreserved information\n\nIf we define an observable Z of the environment by\nX\nZ \u2217 (\u03b1) :=\nh\u03c8i |Y \u2217 (\u03b1)|\u03c8i i|iihi|\ni\n\nthen we have\nEc\u2217 (Z \u2217 (\u03b1)) =\n\nX\n\n\u03bbi h\u03c8i |Y \u2217 (\u03b1)|\u03c8i i|\u03c8i ih\u03c8i | = X \u2217 (\u03b1)\n\ni\n\nThis proves that all the observables preserved by E are also preserved by Ec .\nIn this case, this can also be seen by the fact that we can write2\nE = F \u25e6 Ec\nfor some channel F, which is given by the expression that we used to define Z from\nY:\nX\nF \u2217 (A) =\nh\u03c8i |A|\u03c8i i|iihi|.\ni\n\nTherefore, for a channel of this form, all the information which is preserved in the\nsystem also flows to the environment. This means that the whole of the information\npreserved by E is broadcast, in the sense that this information is accessible from\nboth the system and the environment after the interaction. We saw in Section 3.3,\nthat the sharp observables broadcast in this way must form a commutative algebra.\nClearly, this is not true of these broadcast unsharp effects. Indeed, it is easy\nto see that the operators \u03bbk |\u03c8k ih\u03c8k |, which need not commute with each other,\nare preserved by E and therefore also by Ec . We will see in Section 5.3 that this\ninformation is \"classical\", but in a more general way. This is not surprising as the\nchannel E can be relayed by a classical system. Indeed, it could be simulated by\nfirst measuring the observable \u0393, with elements\n\u0393k = \u03bbk |\u03c8k ih\u03c8k |,\nand then preparing the state |\u03c8k i corresponding to the outcome k of the measurement. Note however that, as we will also see in Section 5.5.2, the information\nbroadcast between only two systems need not even be classical in that more general\nsense.\nAnother way of looking at this channel E is as a pre-measurement of the discrete\nobservables \u0393 defined above. This means that it describes the effect on the state\n\u03c1 of a certain measurement of \u0393, if the actual outcome of the measurement is\ntraced-over or \"forgotten\". In the notation of Section 2.1.6, the measurement is\ndefined by the partial channels Fk (\u03c1) = \u03bbk |\u03c8k ih\u03c8k |\u03c1|\u03c8k ih\u03c8k |. Note that \u0393 itself is at\n2\n\nIn the literature, this property is summarized by saying that Ec degradable, while E is said to\nbe anti-degradable\n\n\fExample: measurements\n\n55\n\nbest approximately preserved by E, in the sense that coarse-grainings (approximate\nversions of) \u0393 are preserved, as for instance the observable with elements\nX\nek =\n\u0393\n\u03bbk |h\u03c8i |\u03c8k i|2 \u0393i = E \u2217 (\u0393k ).\ni\n\ne can be considered an approximation of \u0393 because the distribution |h\u03c8i |\u03c8k i| is\n\u0393\n\"peaked\"at i = k. In the limit where the vectors |\u03c8i i are orthogonal, |h\u03c8i |\u03c8k i| \u2192\n\u03b4ik . However, note that there exists non-trivial observables for which |h\u03c8i |\u03c8k i| is\nindependent of k and i (which are the SIC-POVMs described in Section 5.5.3).\nThe fact that the observable being measured is not preserved in the system\nillustrates the well-known fact that two successive measurements of a POVM do\nnot yield the same outcome for sure. However, \u0393 is exactly preserved by the complementary channel Ec . Indeed, we have\nXp\n\u03bbi \u03bbj hi|kihk|ji|\u03c8i ih\u03c8i |\u03c8j ih\u03c8j |\nEc\u2217 (|kihk|) =\nij\n\n= \u03bbk |\u03c8k ih\u03c8k | = \u0393k\nThis is what is important for E to be a measurement of \u0393: the apparatus (environment) must gain full information about \u0393.\nIt is always true that, if a channel represents the effect of a measurement, then\nits complement exactly preserves the observable being measured. Indeed, recall\nthat in Section 2.1.6 we introduced a measurement by postulating that the channel describing the evolution of the system be complementary to the quantum-toclassical channel defining the observable being measured, namely \u0393. The quantumto-classical channel \u0393 can always be seen as a fully quantum channel by embedding\nits target algebra into the full quantum algebra B(HE ). In addition \u0393 is always\npreserved by \u0393 itself, since it is the image of the \"identity\" classical observable. Let\nus illustrate this when \u0393 is discrete, with elements \u0393i . If we represent \u0393 as a full\nquantum channel, its action is\nX\n\u0393(\u03c1) =\nTr(\u03c1\u0393i )|iihi|\ni\n\nfor some orthonormal basis |ii of the Hilbert space HE . The dual is\nX\n\u0393\u2217 (A) =\nhi|A|ii\u0393i\ni\n\nwhich implies that\n\u0393\u2217 (|iihi|) = \u0393i\nHence \u0393 is the image under \u0393 of the sharp observable with eigenstates |ii, which is\nthe complete \"universal\" observable on the classical system \u03a9. In fact, \u0393 represented\nas a quantum channel is the minimal channel preserving \u0393 itself, which makes sense.\n\n\f56\n\nPreserved information\n\nAll effects\n\nn = 2 (PVM)\n\nn=3\n\nn=4\n\nn=5\n\nn=\u221e\n\nFigure 3.2: Representations of subsets of effects on a qubits in terms of the components\n1, \u03c3x , \u03c3z .

It will be convenient to follow the\ntradition and use the improper eigenstates |xi of x\u0302. An approximate measurement\nof this sharp observable can be represented by the unsharp observable X defined\nby\nZ\n\u2217\nX (\u03b1) =\n\u03b1(y)Xy dy\nR\n\nwhere the operators Xy are\nZ\nXy =\n\ndx |G(x \u2212 y)|2 |xihx|\n\nfor a smearing function G(x), which could for instance be chosen to be a Gaussian\ncentered around zero. Note that since the observable x\u0302 does not in fact have\neigenstates, the proper way of defining Xy would be using functional calculus, as\nXy = |G(x\u0302 \u2212 y1)|2 .\nNormalization of the observable X implies\nZ\ndy|G(x, y)|2 = 1.\nThe effect on the particle of a measurement of this observable could be given by\nthe channel\nZ\nE(\u03c1) = Ey \u03c1Ey\u2217 dy\n\n\f58\n\nPreserved information\n\nwhere the operators Ey are defined by\nZ\nEy = dx G(x \u2212 y)|xihx| = G(y1 \u2212 x\u0302).\nNote that since this channel represents the effect of a measurement, we already\nknow that the information which flows to the environment is precisely the classical\ninformation represented by the observable X being measured. The channel itself\nhowever preserves a lots of information. In particular, it preserved exactly the sharp\nposition observable. Indeed, we have\nZ\n\u2217\nE (|zihz|) = dy Ey\u2217 |zihz|Ey\nZ\n= dy dx dx0 G(x, y)G(x0 , y)\u03b4(x \u2212 z)\u03b4(x0 \u2212 z)|xihx0 |\n\u0012Z\n\u0013\n2\n=\ndy|G(z, y)| |zihz|\n= |zihz|\n\u2202\nNow suppose that we measure the momentum observable p\u0302 = i~ \u2202x\nafter the\nchannel has acted.

It shows that if an observable is measured with a finite accuracy, the\ninformation about the canonical conjugate is preserved up to an accuracy given by\nthe uncertainty relation.\nNote that the measurement which yields the channel E is naturally generated\nby an interaction of the type\nH = \u03bd x\u0302 \u2297 p\u0302.\nbetween two Schr\u00f6dinger particles.

Note that the second moment\nof |G(x)|2 decreases linearly with time. Hence the measurement's accuracy increases continuously with time. However this fact would largely depend on the\nself-Hamiltonian of the second system, which we neglected here.\n\n\f\fChapter 4\nCorrectable information\nIn the previous chapter, we studied observables which are preserved by a channel\nE, in the sense that they can be precisely simulated by another observable after the\nchannel has acted, no matter what the state was. Formally, X is preserved if there\nexists Y such that\nX = Y \u25e6 E.\nWe have seen that when X is sharp, Y can be obtained from X via a channel R:\nY = X \u25e6 R.\nFor these observables, we have\nX = X \u25e6 R \u25e6 E.\nIn this chapter, we will study in greater depth the class of observables which have\nthis property, i.e. which are correctable. Correctable observables are rare compared\nto preserved observables, because they require the channel to have special symmetry\nproperties.\nWe will characterize classes of observables correctable by a common channel R,\nand show that they generalize the known quantum error correcting codes [26, 27, 28,\n29, 30]. Our main result is a generalization of the Knill-Laflamme conditions [27]\nto infinite-dimensional codes, and hybrid quantum-classical codes. Our approach\nis close in spirit to the first concept of noiseless subsystem introduced in [23],\nand technically relies on later results on the correctability of noiseless subsystems\n[31, 32]. Some of the new results presented were published in [1, 2, 3].\n\n4.1\n\nQuantum error correction\n\nLet us suppose that some information is sent through a channel E. The aim of error\ncorrection is to find certain degrees of freedom, the error correcting code (whose\nexact nature we deliberately keep imprecise for the moment), on which the effect of\n61\n\n\f62\n\nCorrectable information\n\nthe channel can be inverted. Since the inversion must be implemented physically,\nit must be a valid physical transformation, i.e. a channel. The inverse channel R is\ncalled the correction channel. The fact that a channel E can always be written as\nX\nE(\u03c1) =\nEi \u03c1Ei\u2217\ni\n\nmeans that we can always assume that the noise is given by a discrete family of\nindividual errors Ei .\nIn fact we will see that if R corrects this channel on some code, then it would\ncorrect also any channel whose elements span the same operator space as the elements of E. This fact is important because often one does not know the precise\nchannel elements Ei . Indeed, suppose that the system interacts continuously with\nits environment via a Hamiltonian H. The most general form of H would be\nX\nH=\nJi \u2297 Ki\ni\n\nwhere the interaction operators Ji act on the system, and the operators Ki act on\nthe environment.\nLet us assume that the initial state of the environment is given by some vector\n|\u03c8i. It is unlikely that we know much about Ki or |\u03c8i given that the environment\nmay be very large and complex. However, it is generally conceivable that we have\na good knowledge of what the operators Ji can be. If Et is the channel describing\nthe evolution of the system alone up to time t, we have\nEt\u2217 (A) = (1 \u2297 h\u03c8|)eitH (A \u2297 1)e\u2212itH (1 \u2297 |\u03c8i)\nX\n(1 \u2297 h\u03c8|)eitH (1 \u2297 |ki)A(1 \u2297 hk|)e\u2212itH (1 \u2297 |\u03c8i)\n=\nk\n\n=\n\nX\n\nEk\u2217 (t)AEk (t)\n\nk\n\nwhere the channel elements are\nEk (t) = (1 \u2297 hk|)e\u2212itH (1 \u2297 |\u03c8i)\nX (\u2212it)n\n(1 \u2297 hk|)H n (1 \u2297 |\u03c8i)\n=\nn!\nn\nX X (\u2212it)n\n=\nhk|Kj1 * * * Kjn |\u03c8iJj1 * * * Jjn .\nn!\nn j ...j\n1\n\nn\n\nHence the channel elements Ek (t) all belong to the algebra generated by the interaction operators Ji . At this point, we could try to find correctable codes for the\nclass of channels whose elements span this algebra. This is possible, but would in\nfact result in codes which need no correction at all (i.e. noiseless subsystems [23]).\nHowever, if the time t at which we aim to perform the correction is small enough,\nwe can do better. Indeed, suppose that \u03bb is some interaction parameter with unit\n\n\fCorrectable observables\n\n63\n\nof energy, then the above series is expressed in powers of t\u03bb. We see that to the nth\norder in t\u03bb, the elements of the channel are in the span of the nth order products\nJj1 * * * Jjn . Hence, if we correct often enough (in order to limit the value of t\u03bb),\nthen we only need to find a correction channel and a code for channel elements in\nthe span of the operators Jj1 * * * Jjn , n < N , for a fixed N . In this context, the\noperators Ji can be seen as representing independent errors. The goal is to find a\ncode as large as possible which corrects as many of these errors as possible.\nFor clarity of the presentation we will stick to the simple picture where the\nchannel E is given. However we will keep the more realistic situation in mind and\ncheck that the correction procedure we devised works not just for the given channel,\nbut also for any channel whose elements span the same space.\n\n4.2\n\nCorrectable observables\n\nLet us introduce a notion of correctability which fits our framework, and then\nlater show how we recover, as a special case, the known results of quantum error\ncorrection. In this section we consider again a channel\nE : Bt (H1 ) \u2192 Bt (H2 )\nDefinition 4.1. We say that an observable X is correctable for E if there is a\nchannel R, called the correction channel, which is such that\nX = X \u25e6 R \u25e6 E.\nWe then say that X is fixed by the channel R \u25e6 E.\nThe operational meaning of this definition is clear. If X is fixed by R \u25e6 E, then\na measurement of X after the application of the channel E followed by R will yield\nthe same outcome as if nothing had happened to the system.\nIt directly follows from this definition that if X is correctable, then it is also\npreserved. Indeed it suffices to define the observable Y := X \u25e6 R to observe that\nX = Y \u25e6 E. Preserved observables however are rarely correctable. Indeed, if X is\ncorrectable then, in particular, the effect X/kXk is also correctable. This suffices to\nshow, for instance, that none of the preserved effects are correctable in the examples\nshown in Figure 3.2, except for the case n = 2 where they are all correctable.\nWe have already identified a class of preserved observables which are correctable,\nnamely the preserved sharp observables. Indeed, in order to prove Theorem 3.5, in\nSection 3.2, we introduced the channel defined by Equation 3.9, namely\n1\n\n1\n\nR\u2217 (A) = E\u03bb (1)\u2212 2 E\u03bb (A)E\u03bb (1)\u2212 2\nwhich was shown to correct all the preserved sharp observables.\n\n\f64\n\nCorrectable information\n\nTheorem 4.1. Given a channel E with elements Ei , and a sharp observable X\nb the following conditions are all equivalent\nrepresented by the self-adjoint operator X,\n1. X is preserved by E,\n2. X is correctable for E,\nb Ei Ej ] = 0 for all i, j.\n3. [X,\nNote the similarity between this proposition and the one obtained in [45], for\nan initially different concept of \"preserved information\".\n\n4.2.1\n\nSimultaneously correctable observables\n\nWe know that, in fact, the sharp preserved observables can all be corrected with\nthe same correction channel. Let us explicitly define this concept.\nDefinition 4.2. A set of observables is said to be simultaneously correctable for\nE if the observables it contains are all correctable in terms of the same correction\nchannel R, which means that they are all fixed by R \u25e6 E.\nBefore we go further, let us remark that, contrary to what happened for preserved observables, the correctable observables are entirely characterized by the\nsimultaneously correctable effects. Indeed, it is clear that an observable X is fixed\nby the channel F if and only if its effects X \u2217 (\u03b1) are all fixed by F. Indeed, by\ndefinition, X = X \u25e6 F if and only if X \u2217 (\u03b1) = F \u2217 (X \u2217 (\u03b1)). More generally, any\nset of observables having simultaneously correctable effects are simultaneously correctable.\nLet us state what we already know:\nProposition 4.2. The effects in the algebra\nA = {A \u2208 B(H1 ) | [A, Ei\u2217 Ej ] = 0 for all i, j}\nare all simultaneously correctable by the channel defined in Equation 3.9.\nAs noted above, this implies that the observables X with X \u2217 (\u03b1) \u2208 A are correctable by the same channel R. We will call A the correctable algebra for E. This is\njustified by the fact that any other algebra spanned by correctable effects is inside\nA. Indeed, such an algebra would be spanned by its projectors, but A already\ncontains all the correctable projectors.\nIn general, a set of simultaneously preserved effects need not be characterized\nby an algebra. However, if a set of effects is simultaneously correctable, then so\nare any linear combinations which also form effects. Since, in addition, effects\nare self-adjoint, this means that a set of simultaneously correctable effects will\nalways be characterized by an operator system S, i.e. a linear subspace S \u2286 B(H1 )\n\n\fCorrectable observables\n\n65\n\nwhich is closed under the \u2217-operation. Hence, if we say that an operator system\nS is correctable, we mean that all the effects in it are correctable. In fact, given\nthat we only consider normal channels, then also any weak-\u2217 limit of such linear\ncombinations will be correctable by the same correction channel. Hence we only\nneed to consider weak-\u2217 closed operator systems.\nWe will now show that many correctable operator systems can be obtained\nthank to Proposition 4.2. Consider any subspace H0 \u2286 H1 , and let\nV : H0 \u2192 H1\nbe the isometry which embeds H0 into H1 . This means that the operator P0 :=\nV V \u2217 , defined on H1 , is the projector on the subspace H0 , whereas V \u2217 V = 10 is the\nidentity inside H0 . We can define a new channel E0 by restricting the channel E to\nthe subspace H0 , which, physically, amounts to making sure that the initial state\nis prepared inside H0 . Hence we define\nE0 (\u03c1) := E(V \u03c1V \u2217 )\nwhose dual is\nE0\u2217 (A) = V \u2217 E \u2217 (A)V\nThis channel has its own correctable algebra:\nA0 = {A \u2208 B(H0 ) | [A, V \u2217 Ek\u2217 El V ] = 0}.\nThis algebra can be naturally embedded in B(H1 ) via the isometry V . Indeed,\nthe map A 7\u2192 V AV \u2217 from B(H0 ) to B(H1 ) is a normal \u2217-homomorphism. Note\nhowever that the identity on B(H0 ) is sent to the projector V V \u2217 = P .\nThe algebra V A0 V \u2217 may or may not be a subalgebra of the correctable algebra\nA. If it is not, then its effects are not correctable for the channel E itself. However,\nwe will see that it is one-to-one with a family of simultaneously correctable effects\nwhich do not form an algebra. Indeed, let R0 be the correction channel for E0 ,\nwhich is a channel from Bt (H2 ) to Bt (H0 ), and define the set\nS0 := E \u2217 (R\u22170 (A0 )).\n\n(4.1)\n\nNote that S0 is not equal to A0 because we have used E \u2217 instead of E0\u2217 in Equation\n4.1. In fact, we have\nA0 = V \u2217 S0 V.\n(4.2)\nThis subset S0 \u2282 B(H1 ) is in general not an algebra, but it is always an operator\nsystem. We claim that all the effects which are in S0 are simultaneously correctable.\nIndeed, for any effect A = E \u2217 (R\u22170 (B)) \u2208 S0 , where B \u2208 A0 , we have\nE \u2217 (R\u22170 (V \u2217 AV )) = E \u2217 (R\u22170 (V \u2217 E \u2217 (R\u22170 (B))V ))\n= E \u2217 (R\u22170 (E0\u2217 (R\u22170 (B))))\n= E \u2217 (R\u22170 (B))\n= A.\n\n\f66\n\nCorrectable information\n\nHence, the correction map is\n\u03c1 7\u2192 V R0 (\u03c1)V \u2217\nwhich is a valid channel from Bt (H2 ) to Bt (H1 ).\nHence, for any subspace H0 \u2286 H1 we can construct an operator system S0\nwhose effects are all simultaneously correctable. In addition, it is clear that all the\nobservables which are formed of effects in S0 are all simultaneously correctable.\nThis proves the following:\nTheorem 4.3. For every subspace H0 \u2286 H1 , the operator system S0 defined in\nEquation 4.1 is such that all the observables X with X \u2217 (\u03b1) \u2208 S0 for all \u03b1 are\nsimultaneously correctable.\nLet us summarize how to obtain S0 . We restricted the channel to the subspace\nH0 , computed the correctable algebra A0 and the correction channel R0 for the\nrestricted channel, and finally set S0 = E \u2217 (R\u22170 (A0 )). In fact we can be entirely\nexplicit. Letting V be the isomorphism embedding H0 into H1 , P := V V \u2217 the\nprojector on H0 , E\u03bb the regularized channel defined on the whole of B(H1 ), and\n1\n\nK := (E\u03bb (P ))\u2212 2\nwe have that the operator system\n\nS0 = {E \u2217 (KE\u03bb (V AV \u2217 )K) | A \u2208 B(H0 ), [A, V \u2217 Ei\u2217 Ej V ] = 0 for all i, j}\nis corrected on E by the channel\nR(\u03c1) = P E\u03bb\u2217 (K\u03c1K)P.\nWe will give an explicit example in Section 4.4.1.\nDo these structures exhaust all the correctable observables for E? Some light\ncould be cast on this question thank to theorem 3 of [45], the proof of which has\nunfortunately not been published at the time of writing. The authors state that,\nwhen H1 is finite-dimensional, the fixed point set of the dual of any channel must\nbe made of elements of the form A + F \u2217 (A) where A belongs to a \u2217-algebra A0\ninside M(H0 ), H0 a subspace of H1 , and F \u2217 is a fixed channel which is such that\nP F \u2217 (A)P = 0, where P projects onto H0 .\nIf an operator system S is correctable for E, then it is fixed by E \u2217 \u25e6 R\u2217 for some\nchannel R, and, according to [45], made of elements of the form mentioned above:\nA + F \u2217 (A). This means that if V is the isometry embedding H0 into H1 , we have\nV \u2217 E \u2217 (R\u2217 (A + F \u2217 (A)))V = V \u2217 (A + F \u2217 (A))V = A, which implies that the algebra\nA0 is correctable for E restricted to H0 , and therefore belongs to the correctable\nalgebra for this restricted channel. This shows that S is of the form covered by\nTheorem 4.3, which therefore exhausts all correctable observables, at least in finite\ndimension.\nIn the next section we will see a reason why, for most applications, it is more\nuseful to make sure that the initial state is in the subspace H0 and work only with\nthe correctable algebra A0 , rather than working with the operator system S0 and\nno restriction on states.\n\n\fCorrectable observables\n\n4.2.2\n\n67\n\nSimultaneously correctable channels\n\nIn section 4.1 we motivated a situation where, of the channel elements Ei , only\ntheir span is known. It is already clear that the correctable algebra\nA = {A | [A, Ei\u2217 Ej ] = 0 for all i, j}\nonly depends on the span of the elements Ei . Indeed,\nconsider a channel E with\nP\n0\nelements Ei and\na\nchannel\nE\nwith\nelements\nF\n=\n\u03b3\nE\ni\nj ij j where \u03b3ij are arbitrary,\nP \u2217\nprovided that i Fi Fi = 1. Then it is clear that an operator which commutes\nwith the products Ei\u2217 Ej for all i and j will also commute with operators Fi\u2217 Fj since\nthey are just linear combinations of the former. This fact tells us that A is the\ncorrectable algebra for all channels whose elements are chosen in the span of the\noperators Ei . However this fact alone would not be very helpful if the correction\nchannel itself depended on the particular choice of channel elements. Fortunately,\nit does not.\nIn fact, we have already exploited part of this freedom in defining R. Indeed,\nremember that we defined it in terms of the map\nX\nE\u03bb (A) =\n\u03bbi Ei AEi\u2217\ni\n\ndefined on B(H1 ) (see Equation 3.6). The sequence \u03bb was chosen so that the infinite\nsum in the expression for E\u03bb is well defined for any operator. However the exact\nvalue of the components \u03bbi did not matter in the proof that R corrects the algebra\nA for the channel E. In fact, the only important aspect of this channel was that its\nelements are linear combinations of the adjoints of the elements of E.\nThe channel R0 correcting E 0 would be defined in the same way in terms of the\nchannel\nX\nE\u03bb0 (A) =\n\u03bbi Fi AFi\u2217\ni\n\n=\n\nX\n\n\u03bbi \u03b3ij \u03b3 ik Ej AEk\u2217\n\nijk\n\nwhich has also the right form for the corresponding correction channel\n1\n\n1\n\nR0 (\u03c1) = (E\u03bb0 )\u2217 ((E\u03bb0 (1))\u2212 2 \u03c1 (E\u03bb0 (1))\u2212 2 )\nto correct the channel E. We will not go through the proof that R0 corrects E on\nA, since precisely the same steps can be followed as for R itself.\nHence we have seen that all the channels whose elements span the same space\nof operators will have the same correctable algebra, and be correctable through the\nsame correction channel. This means that this theory can be applied to the case\ndescribed in Section 4.1, where the span of the elements is all that we know about\nthe channel.\n\n\f68\n\nCorrectable information\n\nThere is a sense in which it is this fact which allows for the quantum errors to\nbe understood as being discrete [35]. Indeed, a standard error model for quantum\ncomputing is that where the system considered is a tensor product of qubits, namely\ntwo-dimensional quantum systems. The possible \"errors\" (i.e. possible channel elements of the noise) are supposed to be any operator acting on no more than n\nsubsystems, where n is fixed. It is clear that this set of errors is continuous. However, for a finite number of qubits their span is separable (in fact finite-dimensional),\nwhich means that it suffices to choose a discrete set which spans the space and try\nto correct these only.\nThis discussion applies to simultaneously correctable sets of observables characterized by an algebra, which are the correctable sharp observables. However, it does\nnot apply to the classes of simultaneously correctable unsharp observables identified\nin the previous section. Indeed, in those cases the correctable operator systems S0\nmay be different for two channels whose elements span the same operator space.\nIndeed, remember that\nS0 = E \u2217 (R\u22170 (A0 )).\nwhere A0 is the correctable algebra for the channel restricted to a subspace H0 ,\nand R0 the corresponding correction channel. Therefore, although both R0 and\nA0 would be the same for both channels, the set S0 in this expression depends\nexplicitly of the action of the channel itself, and may be different in both cases.\n\n4.2.3\n\nNature of correctable channels\n\nThe fact that A is the correctable algebra for the channel E, with correction channel\nR, implies that the map E \u2217 \u25e6 R\u2217 acts simply as the identity on A:\n(E \u2217 \u25e6 R\u2217 )|A = idA\nThe following theorem elucidates what happens to the algebra A prior to its correction:\nTheorem 4.4. Let A be the correctable algebra for a channel E. Then E \u2217 is a normal \u2217-homomorphism of the algebra generated by the pre-image of A. In particular,\nfor any operators B, B 0 such that E \u2217 (B), E \u2217 (B 0 ) \u2208 A, we have\nE \u2217 (BB 0 ) = E \u2217 (B)E \u2217 (B 0 ).\nProof. Remember, that the projectors P in the correctable algebra A satisfy BEi =\nEi P for some operator B, and for all i (see Equation 3.4). It can be directly checked\nthat this is also true of the span of the projectors, which is almost the whole of\nthe algebra A, up to closure. Now consider two operators B and B 0 such that\nA := E \u2217 (B) and A0 := E \u2217 (B 0 ) belong to the span of the projectors of A. We know\n\n\fCorrectable observables\n\n69\n\nthat BEi = Ei A and B 0 Ei = Ei A0 . This implies that BB 0 Ei = BEi A0 = Ei AA0 ,\nfrom which it follows that\nX\nX\nE \u2217 (BB 0 ) =\nEi\u2217 BB 0 Ei =\nEi\u2217 Ei AA0 = AA0\ni\n\u2217\n\ni\n\u2217\n\n0\n\n= E (B)E (B ).\nSince E \u2217 is weak-\u2217 continuous, this condition also applies to the weak-\u2217 closure of\nthe set of operators whose images are in the span of the projectors of A. This shows\nthat the above condition holds for every operators in the pre-image of A.\nNote that the pre-image of A under E \u2217 includes in particular the image of the\ndual of any correction channel R.\nIn fact, the correction channel defined in Equation 3.9 is itself a homomorphism.\nWe saw in the above proof that for all operators A in the span of the projectors of\nA, we have R\u2217 (A)Ei = Ei A. This implies that\nR\u2217 (A)E\u03bb (1) = E\u03bb (A).\nwhich means explicitly\n1\n\n1\n\n(E\u03bb (1))\u2212 2 E\u03bb (A)(E\u03bb (1)) 2 = E\u03bb (A).\nor, simply,\n1\n\n[(E\u03bb (1))\u2212 2 , E\u03bb (A)] = 0.\nFrom the weak-\u2217 continuity of E\u03bb , we have that this is true for all A \u2208 A. Using\nthis fact, and also recalling that [A, Ei\u2217 Ej ] = 0 for all A \u2208 A, we have\n1\n\n1\n\nR\u2217 (A)R\u2217 (A0 ) = (E\u03bb (1))\u2212 2 E\u03bb (A)(E\u03bb (1))\u22121 E\u03bb (A0 )(E\u03bb (1))\u2212 2\n3\n\n1\n\n= (E\u03bb (1))\u2212 2 E\u03bb (A)E\u03bb (A0 )(E\u03bb (1))\u2212 2\n3\n\n1\n\n= (E\u03bb (1))\u2212 2 E\u03bb (1)E\u03bb (AA0 )(E\u03bb (1))\u2212 2\n1\n\n1\n\n= (E\u03bb (1))\u2212 2 E\u03bb (AA0 )(E\u03bb (1))\u2212 2\n= R\u2217 (AA0 ).\nHence, we proved the following proposition:\n\nProposition 4.5. The correction channel given by Equation 3.9 is a faithful representation of the correctable von Neumann algebra A.\nThis shows that the effect of a channel on its correctable algebra simply amounts\nto representing it in a different way on the Hilbert space. These results clarify\ncertain aspects of [47]. We refer to [3] for the precise relationship between our\nresults and those of [47].\n\n\f70\n\n4.3\n\nCorrectable information\n\nError correcting codes\n\nIn Section 4.1 we mentioned that the purpose of quantum error correction was\nto find a \"code\" on which the channel can be inverted, without defining what we\nmeant by a code. In the previous section, we started from the general assumption\nthat a code should be a set of simultaneously correctable observables. We have\nthen found that for any subsystem H0 of the source Hilbert space H1 , we have a set\nof simultaneously correctable observables characterized by an operator system S0 ,\nor equivalently by the von Neumann algebra A0 which is such that A0 = V \u2217 S0 V\nwhere V is the isometry embedding H0 into H1 . The algebra A0 characterizes the\nsharp observables correctable for the channel restricted to the subspace H0 .\nHence, all the codes that we identified, on which the channel can be inverted,\nare, or correspond to, von Neumann algebras. In fact it easy to build abstract\nexamples which yield any possible von Neumann algebra in this way, given that\nall von Neumann algebras can be defined as the commutant of an arbitrary set of\noperators.\nIn order to understand the type of information represented by von Neumann\nalgebras, we need to know how they look like.\n\n4.3.1\n\nStructure of von Neumann algebras\n\nLet us first summarize the representation theory of finite-dimensional von Neumann\nalgebras, which are just \u2217-algebras.\nA concrete finite-dimensional \u2217-algebra A, represented by matrices, i.e. operators on a finite-dimensional Hilbert space, always has the form\nA=\n\nN\nM\n\nMnk \u2297 1mk\n\n(4.3)\n\nk=1\n\nwhere Mnk denotes the full set of matrices on an nk -dimensional Hilbert space,\nand 1mk the identity on an mk -dimensional\nspace. If the dimension of\nP Hilbert\n2\nthe algebra A is D then we have D =\nn\n.\nThe\ndirect sum of two matrix\nk k\nalgebras must be understood as the algebra of block-diagonal matrices, with one\nblock encoding the first algebra, and the other block the second algebra. Therefore\nthe above means that, written as a matrix of blocks,\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\nMn1 \u2297 1m1\n0\n***\n0\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n0\nMn2 \u2297 1m2 * * *\n0\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\nA=\uf8ec\n\uf8f7.\n..\n..\n..\n..\n\uf8ed\n\uf8f8\n.\n.\n.\n.\n0\n0\n* * * MnN \u2297 1mN\nIn addition, tensoring a matrix algebra with the identity on another algebra means\nthat we are considering matrices which are also block-diagonal, with as many blocks\n\n\fError correcting codes\n\n71\n\nas there are elements on the diagonal of the identity matrix, but such that each\nblocks are all identical, not only in their size, but also in their content.\nFor instance, any operator A in the algebra A = (M2 \u2297 12 ) \u2295 (M3 ) has the\nform\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\nB 0 0\nA = \uf8ed0 B 0\uf8f8\n0 0 C\nfor a two-by-two matrix B and a three-by-three matrix C.\nThe block-diagonal structure of A is determined by the form of its center Z(A).\nThe center is the set of operators inside the algebra which commute with all other\nelements of the algebra:\nZ(A) = {A \u2208 A | [A, B] = 0 for all B \u2208 A }.\nIt is a commutative algebra. The center can also be written as the intersection of\nthe algebra with its commutant A0 which is the algebra composed of all operators\ncommuting with all elements of A:\nZ(A) = A \u2229 A0 .\nFor instance, for an algebra of the form Mn \u2297 1m , we have\nZ(Mn \u2297 1m ) = (Mn \u2297 1m ) \u2229 (1n \u2297 Mm ) \u2248 C.\nA von Neumann algebra is said to be a factor if its center is isomorphic to C. Hence\nmatrix algebras of the form Mn \u2297 1m are factors.\nMore generally, if the representation of A is expressed as in Equation 4.3, then\nthe commutant is\nN\nM\n0\nA =\n1nk \u2297 Mmk\nk=1\n\nand the center of A is\nZ(A) =\n\nN\nM\n\nC(1nk \u2297 1mk )\n\n(4.4)\n\nk=1\n\nwhich means that it is composed of diagonal matrices with only N different eigenvalues. If Pk is the projector on the kth block, then this means that a generic\nelement C \u2208 Z(A) of the center is of the form\nX\nC=\nck P k\nk\n\nfor arbitrary complex numbers ck . The algebra A itself is block-diagonal in terms\nof the subspaces defines by the projectors Pk , in the sense that for all A \u2208 A,\nX\nA=\nPk APk .\nk\n\n\f72\n\nCorrectable information\n\nHence the center of the algebra essentially tells us what the blocks are in its representation.\nFor instance, consider again the algebra A = (M2 \u2297 12 ) \u2295 (M3 ). Typical\noperators A \u2208 A, A0 \u2208 A0 and C \u2208 A have the form\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\nB 0 0\na12 b12 0\na12 0\n0\nA = \uf8ed 0 B 0 \uf8f8 A0 = \uf8ed c12 d12 0 \uf8f8 C = \uf8ed 0 a12 0 \uf8f8\n0 0 C\n0\n0 x13\n0\n0 x13\nwhere a, b, c, d, x \u2208 C, B is any 2-by-2 matrix, and C any 3-by-3 matrix.\nWhen A is infinite-dimensional, the direct sum must be replaced by a direct\nintegral. This follows from the fact that the center can be any commutative algebra,\nwhich has the form\nZ(A) \u2248 L\u221e (\u03a9)\nfor some set \u03a9 equipped with a measure. It is with respect to this measure that we\ncan write\nZ \u2295\nA\u2248\n\nA(x) dx\n\u03a9\n\nWhere the generalized \"blocks\" A(x) are factors, i.e. have a trivial center. If \u03a9\nis finite then we must use a discrete measure, which gives us the direct sum in\nEquation 4.4. Hence this integral can be intuitively understood as a continuous\nlimit of the direct sum.\nFactors come in three main types. Up to now we have been using type I factors,\nwhich are always of the form B(H) for some Hilbert space H. Factors of type II\nor III are more exotic. An example of a factor of type II will be studied in Section\n4.4.4.\n\n4.3.2\n\nStandard codes and subsystem codes\n\nTraditionally, a quantum error correcting code is just a subspaces H0 of the initial\nfinite-dimensional Hilbert space H1 , which is assumed to be finite-dimensional [35].\nThe idea is that the channel E is correctable for states in H0 if there is a channel\nR such that\nR(E(\u03c1)) = \u03c1\nfor all states \u03c1 which are mixtures of pure states in the subspace H0 . If we introduce\nthe isometry V : H0 \u2192 H1 which embeds H0 into H1 , this means that\nR(E(V \u03c1V \u2217 )) = V \u03c1V \u2217\nfor all \u03c1 \u2208 Bt (H0 ), which is equivalent to requiring the existence of a channel R0\nsuch that\nR0 (E(V \u03c1V \u2217 )) = \u03c1\nfor all \u03c1 \u2208 Bt (H0 ). Indeed, it suffices to pick R0 (\u03c1) = V \u2217 R(\u03c1)V .\n\n\fError correcting codes\n\n73\n\nIf we define E0 (\u03c1) := E(V \u03c1V \u2217 ), this means that R0 \u25e6 E0 is the identity on Bt (H0 ),\nor equivalently that E \u2217 \u25e6 (R0 )\u2217 is the identity on B(H0 ), which, as we have shown\nmatches our conception of correctability for the algebra B(H0 ). Therefore we recover the framework of standard quantum error correction, for a code H0 , when\nthe correctable algebra is B(H0 ), and the channel is restricted to the subspace H0 .\nIn order to complete the comparison, let us check that our correctability condition reduces to the one introduced for standard codes [27]. The Knill-Laflamme\ncondition states that a standard code represented by the subspace H0 is correctable\nfor the channel E with elements Ei if there exists \u03bbij \u2208 C such that\nV \u2217 Ei\u2217 Ej V = \u03bbij 1\n\nfor all i, j\n\n(4.5)\n\nwhere V embeds H0 into the source Hilbert space H1 . In our framework, the\ncorrectable algebra must be precisely the commutant of the operators V \u2217 Ei\u2217 Ej V\nfor all i and j. Since here they are all proportional to the identity on H0 , the\ncorrectable algebra is indeed the whole algebra of operators on H0 .\nA more general framework was also introduced which generalized the notion of a\ncode to that of a subsystem code [31, 32]. In this approach one defines a code through\na subspace H0 \u2286 H1 and a particular subsystem decomposition HA \u2297 HB = H0 of\nthis subspace. Again, let V be the isometry embedding H0 into H1 . We then say\nthat the subsystem HA is a correctable code if there is a channel R such that\nR(E(V (\u03c1 \u2297 \u03c4 )V \u2217 )) = \u03c1 \u2297 \u03c4 0\nfor any states \u03c1 \u2208 Bt (HA ), \u03c4, \u03c4 0 \u2208 Bt (HB ). We want to show that this is equivalent\nto the case where the correctable algebra A, in our framework, is any factor of type\nI, which in this case is\nA = B(HA ) \u2297 1A .\nThat is, assuming that we are restricting the initial state to the subspace H0 . In\nour language, this would mean that\nV \u2217 E \u2217 (R\u2217 (X \u2297 1))V = X \u2297 1\n\n(4.6)\n\nfor all X \u2208 B(HA ). Indeed, suppose first that HA is a subsystem code corrected by\nR , then we have that for all X \u2208 B(HA ),\nTr(V \u2217 E \u2217 (R\u2217 (X \u2297 1))V (\u03c1 \u2297 \u03c3)) = Tr((X \u2297 1)R(E(V \u03c1 \u2297 \u03c3V \u2217 )))\n= Tr(X\u03c1 \u2297 \u03c4 ) = Tr(X\u03c1)Tr(\u03c4 )\n= Tr(X\u03c1) = Tr((X \u2297 1)(\u03c1 \u2297 \u03c3)).\nThis is true for all states \u03c1 \u2208 Bt (HA ) and all states \u03c3 \u2208 B(Ht (HB )). By linearity\nit follows that V \u2217 E \u2217 (X \u2297 1)V = X \u2297 1 for all X \u2208 B(HA ). Conversely, if Equation\n4.6 is true for all X, then for all \u03c1 \u2208 B(H0 ) we have\nTr(X TrB (R(E(V \u03c1V \u2217 )))) = Tr((X \u2297 1)R(E(V \u03c1V \u2217 )))\n= Tr(V \u2217 E \u2217 (R\u2217 (X \u2297 1))V \u03c1)\n= Tr((X \u2297 1)\u03c1)\n= Tr(X TrB (\u03c1)).\n\n\f74\n\nCorrectable information\n\nSince the above equation is true for all X, we have TrB (R(E(V \u03c1V \u2217 ))) = TrB (\u03c1) for\nall \u03c1 \u2208 Bt (H0 ), which was shown in [32] to be equivalent to the definition of HA\nbeing a noiseless subsystem for E.\nIn this framework, the correctability condition reads [31]\nV \u2217 Ei\u2217 Ej V = 1 \u2297 \u039bij\n\n(4.7)\n\nfor an arbitrary set of operators \u039bij \u2208 B(HB ). This means that the operators\nV \u2217 Ei\u2217 Ej V for all i and j generate the sub-algebra 1 \u2297 B(HB ) of B(H0 ), whose\ncommutant is indeed B(HA ) \u2297 1: the correctable algebra defining the subsystem\ncode.\nNote that a subsystem code can always also be identified as a standard code,\nprovided that we can afford to put stronger constraints on the initial state. Indeed,\nconsider the smaller subspace H00 formed by the states inside H0 which are of the\nform |\u03c8i \u2297 |\u03c60 i, where |\u03c60 i is fixed. This subspace is associated with the isometry\nW = V \u2297 |\u03c60 i, for which we have\nW \u2217 Ei\u2217 Ej W = h\u03c60 |\u039bij |\u03c60 i1\nwhich is just the Knill-Laflamme condition for H00 .\nThese results show that the standard codes, as well as the subsystems codes,\ncorrespond to the case where our correctable algebra is a finite-dimensional factor,\nwhich is always of type I. Our results yield two types of generalization over these\ncodes. Firstly, we obtain a characterization of infinite-dimensional quantum codes\nand continuous classical codes, which will be discussed briefly in Section 4.3.4. In\naddition, we can correct information which is not quantum nor classical, i.e. which\nis represented by an algebra which is not commutative nor a factor.\n\n4.3.3\n\nHybrid codes\n\nWe have seen that in our framework, the structure to be corrected, i.e. representing\nthe code, can be any von Neumann algebra. A general von Neumann algebra with\ncenter Z(A) = L\u221e (\u03a9) is of the form\nZ \u2295\nA=\nA(x)dx\n(4.8)\n\u03a9\n\nwhere each A(x) is a factor. If the center is maximal, i.e. Z(A) = A, then the\nalgebra A is commutative and each factor A(x) is of dimension one, i.e. isomorphic\nto the complex numbers C. If, on the other hand, the center is minimal, i.e.\nZ(A) \u2248 C, then the set \u03a9 contains only a single element x0 and A = A(x0 ) is a\nfactor.\nIf A is commutative, then it represents a classical system, which is clear from\nthe fact that it has the form L\u221e (\u03a9). It is then natural to say that if it is a factor,\nit represents a \"pure\" quantum system.\n\n\fError correcting codes\n\n75\n\nA physical system represented by an algebra, whose structure is given by the\ngeneral form 4.8, can be understood as being partly quantum and partly classical. Indeed, we can consider the center Z(A) = L\u221e (\u03a9) as representing a classical\nsystem. For each possible \"state\" x \u2208 \u03a9 of this classical system, we have a pure\nquantum system represented by the factor A(x).\nFor instance, a classical system, represented by L\u221e (\u03a9), next to a type I quantum\nsystem, with algebra B(H), is represented by\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\n\u2295\n\nA(x)dx\n\nA = L (\u03a9) \u2297 B(H) '\n\u03a9\n\nwhere each factor A(x) is a copy of B(H). In the more general case however, the\nsize and type of the algebra A(x) may depend upon x.\nR\u2295\nGeneric operators A, B \u2208 \u03a9 A(x) dx are of the form\nZ\nZ\nBx dx\n(4.9)\nAx dx and B =\nA=\n\u03a9\n\n\u03a9\n\nWhere Ax , Bx \u2208 A(x) for all x \u2208 \u03a9. Their product is simply\nZ\nAB =\nAx Bx dx.\n\u03a9\n\nAn element of the center is of the form\nZ\nC=\n\u03b1(x)1x dx\n\u03a9\n\nwhere \u03b1 \u2208 L\u221e (\u03a9) and 1x is the identity on Ax .\nIf A in Equation 4.9 is an effect, then each operator Ax is also an effect which\ncan be interpreted as a quantum proposition which is true conditionally on the\nclassical system being in state x.\nIf the finite-dimensional case, if a hybrid algebra\nM\nA=\nMnk \u2297 1mk\nk\n\nis correctable, then each factor Ak = Mnk \u22971mk represents a correctable subsystem\ncode for states restricted to the subspace Hk projected onto by Pk = 1nk \u2297 1mk .\nIndeed, if V is the isometry corresponding to Pk , then V AV \u2217 is the representation\ninside A of an operator A \u2208 Ak . Therefore\nV \u2217 E \u2217 (R\u2217 (V AV \u2217 ))V = V \u2217 V AV \u2217 V = A.\nTherefore, a finite-dimensional hybrid algebra can be understood as representing a\nfamily of orthogonal subsystem codes correctable simultaneously.\n\n\f76\n\n4.3.4\n\nCorrectable information\n\nInfinite-dimensional subsystem codes\n\nThe derivation of necessary and sufficient conditions for error correction of infinitedimensional algebras is an interesting new result, given that all physical systems\nare naturally modeled by infinite-dimensional systems. In particular, it yields a\nformulation of quantum error correction for systems characterized by continuous\nvariables [48].\nA code can be said to be purely quantum if it is represented by an algebra\nwhich is a factor. In the finite-dimensional case, we have seen in Section 4.3.2 that\nfactors represent subsystem codes characterized by Equation 4.7, or Equation 4.5.\nSome authors assumed that this condition would hold unchanged in the infinitedimensional case. For instance, in [49] the Knill-Laflamme condition was expressed\nfor a channel with continuous elements Ex as\nV \u2217 Ex\u2217 Ey V = \u03bb(x, y)1\nwhere \u03bb(x, y) \u2208 C. Our results show that this condition is sufficient. Indeed, it\nimplies that the commutant of the operators V \u2217 Ex\u2217 Ey V for all x and y is the whole\nalgebra M(H0 ) on the subspace H0 \u2286 H1 . However, in infinite dimension this condition is no longer necessary since it expresses that the code must be isomorphic\nto M(H0 ), which is a factor of type I. Hence it misses the possibility of correcting\nmore general factors. This means that our generalization of quantum error correction to infinite-dimensional systems introduces new types of quantum codes not\npreviously considered, namely factors of type II and III. An example of correctable\ntype II factor is given in Section 4.4.4 below.\n\n4.4\n\nExamples\n\nLet us conclude this chapter by giving a few examples demonstrating features of\nthe new type of codes that we obtained.\n\n4.4.1\n\nOperator system\n\nWe can easily construct examples of correctable operator systems which are not\nalgebras by taking any algebraic code correctable on a subspace H0 \u2286 H1 , and\nusing the correction channel to \"lift\" it to an operator system correctable without\nrestriction on states, as explained in Section 4.2.1. As an example, we will take the\nsimplest standard code which corrects any random bit flip. This code is defined\nby a two-dimensional subspace H0 \u223c C2 of a three-qubit Hilbert system H1 . It\nis chosen such that the whole algebra of operators on the subspace is correctable\nfor any channel with elements in the span of the \"error operators\" {1, X1 , X2 , X3 }\nwhere Xi is a Pauli matrix acting on the ith qubit. The subspace H0 is defined by\nthe isometry\nV |ii = |iiii\n\n\fExamples\n\n77\n\nwhere i \u2208 {0, 1} and we wrote |iiii = |ii \u2297 |ii \u2297 |ii. We also define\nP := V V \u2217 = |000ih000| + |111ih111|.\nIt is easy to check that a correction channel for this code is\nX\nR\u2020 (A) = V AV \u2217 +\nXi V AV \u2217 Xi\ni\n\ni.e., V \u2217 E \u2217 (R\u2217 (A))V = A for all A \u2208 M(H0 ).\nThe algebra correctable on the code H0 , as seen embedded in B(H1 ) is\nnX\no\nV A0 V \u2217 = V M(H0 )V \u2217 =\n\u03b1ij |iiiihjjj| : \u03b1ij \u2208 C\nij\n\nIn order to proceed, we need a specific error channel. We will pick one which\ncorresponds to assigning a probability for the occurrence of each error in the set\n{1, X1 , X2 , X3 }:\nX\nE(\u03c1) = p0 \u03c1 +\npi Xi \u03c1Xi .\ni\n\nWriting X0 := 1 for convenience, the operator system\nS0 = E \u2217 (R\u2217 (A0 )) =\n\n1\nnX\n\n\u03b1ij\n\ni,j=0\n\n3\nX\n\npk Xk Xl |iiiihjjj|Xl Xk : \u03b1ij \u2208 C\n\no\n\nk,l=0\n\nis correctable by R on all states.

Explicitly separating\nthe components respectively inside V A0 V \u2217 and orthogonal to V A0 V \u2217 we have\n\u0011\no\nnX \u0010\nX\npk Xk Xl |iiiihjjj|Xl Xk : \u03b1ij \u2208 C .\nS0 =\n\u03b1ij |iiiihjjj| +\nij\n\n4.4.2\n\nk6=l\n\nClassical channels\n\nFormally, we only derived our results for quantum channels. However we can deduce\nwhat happens in the case of a channel between two classical systems. For simplicity,\nlet us consider the finite-dimensional case. A classical channel\n\u03c0 : L(\u03a91 ) \u2192 L(\u03a92 ).\ncan be represented by a quantum channel\nE : M(L2 (\u03a91 )) \u2192 M(L2 (\u03a92 ))\ndefined by\nE(\u03c1) =\n\nX\nij\n\n\u03c0ij hj|\u03c1|ji|iihi|.\n\n\f78\n\nCorrectable information\n\nwhere\nX\n\n\u03c0ij = 1.\n\ni\n\nThis means that the channel elements are\nEij =\n\n\u221a\n\n\u03c0ij |iihj|.\n\nIn order to make sure that our scheme is entirely classical, we want to check that\nthe correction channel R is classical. In finite dimension, it can be constructed as\nR(\u03c1) = E \u2217 (K\u03c1K)\n1\n\nwhere K := (E(1))\u2212 2 . Clearly K is diagonal in our basis |ii, and E \u2217 maps diagonal\noperators to diagonal operators. Therefore R represents a classical channel.\nIn order to find the correctable algebra, note that\n\u221a\nEij\u2020 Ekl = \u03b4ik \u03c0ij \u03c0il |jihl|.\nP\nA classical effect \u03b1 = k \u03b1k |kihk| is correctable if and only if it commutes with all\nthese operators, i.e.\nX\u221a\nX\u221a\n\u03c0ij \u03c0il \u03b1k |kihk|jihl| =\n\u03c0ij \u03c0il \u03b1k |jihl|kihk|\n\u2200i, j, l\nk\n\nk\n\n\u21d0\u21d2\n\u21d0\u21d2\n\n\u03b1j \u03c0ij \u03c0il |jihl| = \u03b1l \u03c0ij \u03c0il |jihl|\n(\u03b1j \u2212 \u03b1l )\u03c0ij \u03c0il = 0\n\n\u2200i, j, l\n\u2200i, j, l\n\nHence, the effect \u03b1 can be corrected if and only if \u03b1j = \u03b1k for all the states k, j\nwhich are such that there exists i with \u03c0ij 6= 0 and \u03c0ik 6= 0. This simply means\nthat two states cannot be distinguished from each other when there is a nonzero\nprobability for a transition from a common state to both of them.\nLet us see what the correction channel does explicitly. First, note that\nX\nXX\n1\n1\n1\nK = (E(1))\u2212 2 = (\n\u03c0ij |iihi|)\u2212 2 =\n(\n\u03c0ij )\u2212 2 |iihi|\nij\n\ni\n\nj\n\nP\nwhere the sum over i is restricted\nto\nthe\nthe\nterms\nwhich\nare\nsuch\nthat\n6\nj \u03c0ij =\nP\n0.\nLet\nus\ndefine\nK\n:=\n\u03c0\n.\nThe\ncorrection\nchannel\non\na\nclassical\nstate\n\u03c1\n=\ni\nj ij\nP\ni \u03bci |iihi| is\nX \u03bci\nX \u03bci \u03c0ik\nP\nP\nR(\u03c1) =\nE \u2217 (|iihi|) =\n|kihk|.\n\u03c0\n\u03c0\nij\nij\nj\nj\ni\nik\nExpressed as a stochastic matrix, it has components\n\u03c0ji\n\u03c0ijR = P\n.\nk \u03c0jk\n\n\fExamples\n\n79\n\nNote that the stochastic matrix element \u03c0ji is the probability that the channel \u03c0\nwould output the state j if the input was i. We see that this correction channel does\nthe following: if it is fed with the state j, it randomly outputs any of the states i for\nwhich \u03c0ji 6= 0. Indeed, it has no way of knowing which one of these was the initial\nstate. However it knows that it could not have been any other state. Clearly the\ncorrection works exactly only if there is no ambiguity, i.e. if j could have come only\nfrom a single state i. This is why the correctable observables are those which do not\ndistinguish between two states which have a non-zero probability of transitioning\nto the same output state j.\n\n4.4.3\n\nFailed teleportation\n\nWe can view the standard quantum teleportation protocol [50] as an example of\nquantum error correction. Indeed, Bob must find a way to reconstruct Alice's quantum information from the classical bits she provides, and his half of the entangled\npair.\nHere we will use our framework to show that if some of the classical information\ngets lost in the way, Bob will only be able to reconstruct a hybrid.\nFor teleportation to be possible, Bob and Alice must initially share a pair of\nentangled qubits. This pair is described by the state\n1\n|\u03c8i = \u221a (|0i \u2297 |0i + |1i \u2297 |1i).\n2\nBeside her entangled qubit, Alice possesses an other qubit in an arbitrary state \u03c1\nthat she wants to transmit to Bob. The point of the protocol is that she is not\nallowed to send Bob any quantum information. This means that all she can do is\nto perform some measurement on her pair of qubits, and send the classical result\nto Bob (see Figure 4.1).\nThe measurement that she must perform is the one defined by the basis of four\northogonal maximally entangled states, which can be obtain by applying the Pauli\nmatrices to one half of |\u03c8i. Hence the observable's elements are\nXi = (1 \u2297 Ui )|\u03c8ih\u03c8|(1 \u2297 Ui\u2217 ) = |\u03c8i ih\u03c8i |\nwhere U0 = 1 and Ui = \u03c3iPfor i \u2208 {1, 2, 3}. Note that Ui\u2217 = Ui . One can check\nby direct calculation that i Xi = 1. These states are all maximally entangled\nbecause they are obtained by local transformations of a maximally entangled state.\nThe key property of these states is the following:\n|\u03c8i i = (1 \u2297 Ui )|\u03c8i = (Ui \u2297 1)|\u03c8i.\nThe channel from Alice to Bob is:\nE(\u03c1) = (X \u2297 id)(\u03c1 \u2297 |\u03c8ih\u03c8|)\n\n\f80\n\nCorrectable information\n\nFigure 4.1: Left: standard teleportation circuit. Time runs from bottom to top.\nThe input is Alice's quantum state to be teleported. The first half disk is a maximally entangled Bell state of two qubits. The second half disk represents a measurement in the Bell basis, the output of which is classical information (the outcome of\nthe measurement). This classical information together with the second entangled\nqubit are given to Bob who decodes the information by applying a unitary transform on the qubits, conditioned on the classical information. Right: what should\nBob do, and how much of the quantum information can he recover, if some of the\nclassical information is lost in the way?\n\n\fExamples\n\n81\n\nwhere id is the identity channel on Bob's half of |\u03c8i. To expand this, note that if\nwe represent the classical target system of X in terms of diagonal quantum states,\nwe have, for an arbitrary state \u03c10 of Alice's couple of qubits,\nX\nX\nX(\u03c10 ) =\nTr(Xi \u03c10 )|iihi| =\n|iih\u03c8i |\u03c10 |\u03c8i ihi|\ni\n\ni\n\nTherefore,\nE(\u03c1) =\n\nX\n(|iih\u03c8i | \u2297 1)(\u03c1 \u2297 |\u03c8ih\u03c8|)(|\u03c8i ihi| \u2297 1)\ni\n\n=\n=\n=\n=\n=\n=\n\n1X\n(|iih\u03c8i | \u2297 1)(\u03c1 \u2297 |jihk| \u2297 |jihk|)(|\u03c8i ihi| \u2297 1)\n2 ijk\n1X\n|iih\u03c8i |(\u03c1 \u2297 |jihk|)|\u03c8i ihi| \u2297 |jihk|\n2 ijk\n1X\nh\u03c8|(Ui \u03c1Ui \u2297 |jihk|)|\u03c8i |iihi| \u2297 |jihk|\n2 ijk\n1 X\nhn|Ui \u03c1Ui |mihn|jihk|mi |iihi| \u2297 |jihk|\n4 ijknm\n1X\nhj|Ui \u03c1Ui |ki |iihi| \u2297 |jihk|\n4 ijk\n1X\n1X\n|iihi| \u2297 |jihj|Ui \u03c1Ui |kihk| =\n|iihi| \u2297 Ui \u03c1Ui .\n4 ijk\n4 i\n\nOnce Bob receives this state, it is clear that he just has to measure the classical\nsystem, and apply the inverse of the corresponding unitary transformation in order\nto recover the state \u03c1.\nFrom the point of view of quantum error correction, we can see that the qubit\ncan indeed be recovered by computing the operators Ei\u2217 Ej where\n1\nEi = |ii \u2297 Ui .\n2\nIndeed, we have\nEi\u2217 Ej \u221d hi|ji \u2297 Ui\u2020 Uj = \u03b4ij Ui\u2020 Ui = \u03b4ij 1.\nThis shows that the whole algebra of operators on the qubit is correctable.\nNote that we can teleport n qubits simply by applying this protocol to each\nqubits in parallel, which requires also n entangled pairs shared between Alice and\nBob. In this case the channel from Alice to Bob is\nEn (\u03c1) =\n\n1 X\n(n)\n(n)\n|iihi| \u2297 Ui \u03c1Ui\n4n i\n\n\f82\n\nCorrectable information\n\nwhere \u03c1 is now an n qubits state, and Ui , i = 0, . . . , 4n \u2212 1 are all possible tensor\nproducts of Pauli operators and identity operators.\nAn interesting aspect of this teleportation protocol is that, in a way, the quantum state to be transmitted is entirely encoded in the classical information being\ntransmitted. More precisely, n qubits seem to be encoded in 2n classical bits. But\nhow is this encoding done? We will try to clarify this question by answering a more\nprecise one: what aspects of the quantum information do we loose if we destroy\nsome of the classical information?\nThe most general way of destroying some of the classical information transmitted from Alice to Bob consists in applying a classical channel \u03c0 to it (see Figure\n4.1). The channel elements of the classical channel are (see Section 4.4.2)\nFij =\n\n\u221a\n\n\u03c0ij |iihj|\n\nso that the overall channel from Alice to Bob has elements\nFij Ek =\n\n1\u221a\n1\u221a\n(n)\n(n)\n\u03c0ij |iihj|ki \u2297 Uk = \u03b4jk\n\u03c0ij |ii \u2297 Uj .\n2\n2\n\nThe relevant operators for determining the correctable sharp observables are, dropping the unimportant factors 21 ,\n\u221a\n(n) (n)\nEk\u2217 Fij\u2217 Fi0 j 0 Ek0 \u221d \u03b4jk \u03b4j 0 k0 \u03c0ij \u03c0i0 j 0 hi|i0 i Uj Uj 0\n\u221a\n(n) (n)\n= \u03b4jk \u03b4j 0 k0 \u03b4ii0 \u03c0ij \u03c0ij 0 Uj Uj 0 .\nTherefore, the correctable sharp effects are those commuting with the operators\n\u221a\n(n) (n)\n\u03c0ij \u03c0ik Uj Uk\nfor all i, j, k.\nAn effect may commute with one of these operators for one of two reasons.\nEither it is invariant under the corresponding transformation, or\n\u03c0ij \u03c0ik = 0.\nRemember from the classical error correction example (Section 4.4.2), that this condition on \u03c0 means that the classical state j cannot be distinguished from the state\nk because of the noise. Hence, whenever the noise erases the distinction between\ntwo classical states j and k, the observables that Bob can recover must be invariant\n(n) (n)\nunder the unitary transformation Uj Uk . This result can be understood as implying that the classical information encodes how Bob's qubit must be transformed\nin order to recover Alice's state, which is in fact precisely how Bob effectively interprets it. If the information about which transformation to apply is lost, then the\nobservables which can be recovered are those which do not distinguish between the\noutcomes of the two transformations.\n\n\fExamples\n\n83\n\nFor instance, in the case n = 1, suppose that we loose the distinction between\nj = 0 and k = 3, which corresponds to the unitary operators 1 and \u03c3z . The\ncorrectable observables must then commute with \u03c3z , which implies that they must\nbe diagonal. Therefore they only represent one single bit of information from Alice's\nqubit. However, if we also loose the distinction between the states 1 and 2, the\ncorrectable information is exactly the same. Indeed, the new symmetry that must\nbe imposed in this case is \u03c3x \u03c3y \u221d \u03c3z . This shows that our error correction technique\nmisses some information in the former case.\nRecall that the correctable information is characterized by the sharp preserved\nobservables. In order to see what happens in more detail, we would need to look\nat the preserved unsharp observables. For simplicity, let us simply consider the\npreserved unsharp effects. Note that an effect of the hybrid quantum-classical\nsystem of Bob is of the form\nX\nB=\n\u03b2i |iihi| \u2297 Bi .\ni\n\nIts image in the Heisenberg picture is\nA=\n\n1\n1X\n\u03c0ij \u03b2i Uj Bi Uj = [\u03b20 (B0 + \u03c3z B0 \u03c3z ) + \u03b21 \u03c3x B1 \u03c3x + \u03b22 \u03c3y B2 \u03c3y ].\n4 ij\n4\n\nWe can always choose \u03b21 = \u03b22 = 1, and B1 and B2 in order to obtain any effect for\nthe second and third term. However, the term\nX\nB0 + \u03c3z B0 \u03c3z = 2\n|iihi|B0 |iihi|\ni\n\nis always diagonal. Therefore we can write all the preserved effects as\n1\n1\nA= D+ B\n2\n2\nwhere B is an arbitrary effect, and D is any diagonal effect. The further loss of\nthe distinction between the states 1 and 2 would also force the second terms to be\ndiagonal, so that only diagonal effects are then preserved.\n\n4.4.4\n\nIrrational rotation algebra\n\nConsider the algebra generated by two elements x\u0302 and p\u0302 satisfying the canonical\ncommutation relations\n[x\u0302, p\u0302] = i1.\nThis algebra can be represented on H = L2 (R), where the position operator x\u0302 acts\non a function \u03c8 \u2208 L2 (R) as (x\u0302\u03c8)(x) = x\u03c8(x) and the momentum p\u0302 as (p\u0302\u03c8)(x) =\nd\ni dx\n\u03c8(x).\n\n\f84\n\nCorrectable information\n\nSuppose that this\nP system interacts with an environment through a Hamiltonian\nof the form H = i Ji \u2297 Ki , where the operators Ji act on the system, and the\noperators Ki on the environment. We have seen in Section 4.1 that this implies that\nthe channel elements of the resulting channel on the system belong to the algebra\ngenerated by the operators Ji .\nWe will now suppose that the interaction operators Ji are of two forms. Some\nare periodic functions of x\u0302, with period Lx , and others are periodic functions of p\u0302, of\nperiod Lp . This implies that these functions are linear combinations of powers of the\n2\u03c0\n\n2\u03c0\niL\np\n\nfunctions x 7\u2192 ei Lx x or p 7\u2192 e\nFor convenience, let us define\n\np\n\n\u03c9x :=\n\nrespectively (their discrete Fourier components).\n2\u03c0\nLx\n\nand\n\n\u03c9p :=\n\n2\u03c0\nLp\n\nThe von Neumann algebra generated by the interaction operators is also generated\nby the two unitary operators\nU = ei\u03c9x x\u0302\n\nand V = ei\u03c9p p\u0302\n\nIn addition, we assume that the real number\n\u03b8 :=\n\n\u03c9x \u03c9p\n2\u03c0\n\nis irrational. This number is important because it enters into the commutator of U\nand V :\nU V = e2\u03c0i\u03b8 V U.\nIn principle, in order to find the correctable algebra, we need to find the operators commuting with the products Ei\u2217 Ej of the channel elements Ei . However,\nsince we only know the span of these operators, we cannot exclude that Ei = 1\nfor some i. If this is the case, then these products include Ei and Ei\u2217 for all i.\nTherefore, for an effects to be correctable, it needs to be in the commutant of the\nvon-Neumann algebra generated by the operators Ei for all i, which is the same as\nthe von Neumann algebra generated by the interaction operators Ji .\nThe operators\nU 0 = ei\n\n\u03c9x\n\u03b8\n\nx\u0302\n\nand V 0 = ei\n\n\u03c9p\n\u03b8\n\np\u0302\n\ncommute with both U and V . To see that U 0 commutes with V , simply note that:\nU 0 V = ei\n\n\u03c9x \u03c9p\n\u03b8\n\nV U 0 = ei\n\n2\u03c0\u03b8\n\u03b8\n\nV U 0 = V U 0.\n\nSimilarly, V 0 also commutes with both U and V . In fact, the von Neumann algebra\ngenerated by U 0 and V 0 is the whole commutant of the algebra generated by the\ninteraction operators Ji [51]. In addition, it happens to be a factor of type II, and,\ntogether, with its commutant they generate the whole of B(H).\n\n\fExamples\n\n85\n\nTherefore, this is an example of a correctable factor of type II. In fact, it is also\nnoiseless [23], in the sense that the correction channel can be taken to be the identity\nchannel, i.e. no active correction is needed. This happens simply because 1 was\nassumed to be among the channel elements. Indeed, we saw that it implied that\nthe correction operators had to commute with the channel elements themselves.\nHence, if E is the channel, we have E \u2217 (A) = E \u2217 (1)A = A for all elements A of the\ncorrectable algebra.\nLet us see how we can understand this \"type II subsystem\", and how it resembles, and differs from, the factors of type I with which we are familiar. If we were\ndealing with a factor of type I containing the identity, then the Hilbert space would\ntake the form H = H1 \u2297 H2 , so that our algebra would be simply B(H1 ) \u2297 1. In this\nsense, a factor of type I defines a subsystem in the traditional sense. For instance,\nconsider H = L2 (R2 ) = L2 (R) \u2297 L2 (R). If \u03c8 \u2208 L2 (R2 ), the operators in the first\nfactor A = B(L2 (R)) \u2297 1 are those which act only on the first component of \u03c8. For\ninstance, the first factor is generated by the operators (x\u0302\u03c8)(x, y) = x\u03c8(x, y) and\nd\n\u03c8(x, y). Note that here the set R2 on which the states are defined\n(p\u0302\u03c8)(x, y) = dx\ncan be understood to be the set of joint eigenvalues to the position operators in A\nand A0 .\nSomething similar happens for our factor of type II. Let A be the factor generated by U and V , and A0 its commutant, which is generated by U 0 and V 0 . Let\nus see if we could see the elements of H as wavefunctions over the eigenvalues of\nU and U 0 . First, note that the spectrum of both these operators is a circle (represented in the complex plane). These two operators being functions of the position\noperator x\u0302, we may want to use the fact that the states of H can be represented\nas wavefunction over the spectrum of x\u0302, i.e. elements of L2 (R). Indeed, we can\nnaturally convert an eigenvalue x of x\u0302 into the eigenvalues\na = ei\u03c9x x\n\nand\n\nb = ei\n\n\u03c9x\nx\n\u03b8\n\n(4.10)\n\nrespectively of U and U 0 . In fact, this relationship is invertible. Indeed, if we are\ngiven a and b, then only a single real number x will satisfy both these relations.\nIndeed, suppose that we had two different real numbers x and x0 yielding the same\nvalues of a and b. This would imply that they are related by x \u2212 x0 = 2\u03c0n/\u03c9 =\n2\u03c0m\u03b8/\u03c9 for two integers n and m. But this would imply \u03b8 = n/m, which is\nnot possible since we assumed \u03b8 to be irrational. This implies that for each state\n\u03c8 \u2208 L2 (R), we can define the function\ne b) := \u03c8(x)\n\u03c8(a,\nwhere x is the unique real number related to a and b via the Equations 4.10. Note\nthat this function \u03c8e is defined only on the valid couples (a, b) related to some x \u2208 R\nvia Equation 4.10. However, due to the irrationality of \u03b8, these couples are dense\nin the unit torus. We can therefore think of \u03c8e as being defined almost everywhere\non the torus. We will indeed see that it can be interpreted, in a suitable sense, as\nthe wavefunction of a particle on a two-dimensional torus.\n\n\f86\n\nCorrectable information\n\ne b) and the factors A and A0 is\nThe relation between the wavefunctions \u03c8(a,\ngiven by the fact that they \"act\" respectively on the first and second arguments of\n\u03c8 respectively. Indeed, we have\ne\ne b)\n(U \u03c8)(a,\nb) = (U \u03c8)(x) = ei\u03c9x x \u03c8(x) = a \u03c8(a,\nwhich means that it acts just like the first component of the position of the particle.\nSimilarly,\n\u03c9x\ne b)\ne\n(U 0 \u03c8)(a,\nb) = (U 0 \u03c8)(x) = ei \u03b8 x \u03c8(x) = b \u03c8(a,\nThe action of V is also easy to compute:\ne\n(V \u03c8)(a,\nb) = (V \u03c8)(x) = \u03c8(x + \u03c9p ) = \u03c8(a e2\u03c0i\u03b8 , b).\nHence, its effect is to rotate the first argument by the irrational angle \u03b8. Similarly,\n1\n\ne\n(V 0 \u03c8)(a,\nb) = (V 0 \u03c8)(x) = \u03c8(x + \u03c9p /\u03b8) = \u03c8(a, b e2\u03c0i \u03b8 ).\nAlthough it looks like a particle on the torus, this system differs from it by the\nnature of the normalized states. Indeed, the norm is\nZ\nZ\n2\n2\ne\ne i\u03c9x x , ei \u03c9\u03b8x x )|2 dx.\nk\u03c8k = |\u03c8(x)| dx = |\u03c8(e\nWhat we have done is to take a standard particle in a one-dimensional space, and\nwrap its space around a torus in a dense trajectory. If we view the particle as a\nwavefunction \u03c8e on the torus, its norm is an integral over this dense path. This\npicture illustrates what the noise does. It disturbs only the first component of the\nposition of this particle, but not the second.\n\n\fChapter 5\nDecoherence\nIn this chapter we present three different models of decoherence. The third one\nbeing, in a way, a combination of the first two. The first model (Section 5.2)\nfocuses on sharp observables, and is essentially based on our results related to\nquantum error correction. It will serve as a guide for our intuition as to what\nhappens in the more general case involving unsharp observables. The second model\n(Section 5.4) focuses on the system itself, ignoring the environment, and defines\nthe notion of an unsharp pointer observable. The third, more complete picture\n(Section 5.5) considers the exchange of unsharp information between the system\nand the environment. These results were presented in [4].\nBefore we describe these models, we will come back on a point made in the\nintroduction, and define what we mean by a classical limit.\n\n5.1\n\nNature of a classical limit\n\nIn nature, a classical system is a quantum system which happens to be in a context\nwhere its behaviour can be successfully modeled by a classical theory. In principle,\nneglecting computational difficulties, we ought to be able to model this system's\nbehaviour using its full quantum description as well. This implies that we should\nhave in principle two different models which both describe the same physical system:\na quantum one, specified by an algebra of the form B(H), and a classical one, defined\nby a commutative algebra L\u221e (\u03a9). Since the quantum theory is more fundamental,\nwe should be able to translate every propositions of the classical model (i.e. every\neffects) into a proposition in the underlying quantum language. This means that\nwe should have a map of the form\n\u0393\u2217 : L\u221e (\u03a9) \u2192 B(H)\nwhich maps effects to effects. In addition, we may expect that a certain knowledge\nabout the quantum system should induce back a knowledge about the effective\nclassical propositions. We followed the same arguments in Section 2.1.2 when we\n87\n\n\f88\n\nDecoherence\n\nintroduced observables, which yielded the requirement that the map must be linear,\npositive, unital and normal. The map \u0393\u2217 is the dual of a channel \u0393 which maps\nquantum states into classical states, just like an observable:\n\u0393 : Bt (H) \u2192 L1 (\u03a9).\nHence, we expect that a classical limit, at the kinematical level, is given by\nan observable. Our model of decoherence will take quite literally the idea that a\nclassical limit emerges from a \"measurement\" of the system by the environment.\nIn those terms, \u0393 is simply the observable being measured. We will refer to \u0393 as\nthe pointer observable.\n\n5.1.1\n\nQuantization\n\nWe know that \u0393 does not only define a map from classical effects to quantum effects,\nbut more generally a map from classical observables to quantum observables. Hence\nit can be understood as defining, in a somewhat restricted sense, a quantization\nprocedure.\nIn its most general form, a classical observable on a classical system defined by\nthe algebra L\u221e (\u03a9) is a channel\n\u03c0 : L1 (\u03a9) \u2192 L1 (\u03a90 ).\nFor instance, suppose that \u03a9 = R2 is the phase-space for a single continuous variable system (say a single particle in a one-dimensional space). Then the position\nobservable is the map which sends\nR a probability distribution \u03bc(q, p) over the phase2\n0\nspace R to its marginal \u03bc = \u03bc(q, p) dp (see also Figure 2.1 for the action of the\ndual map). But observables need not have only scalar values. For instance, there\nis a phase-space observable, which is simply the identity map on L1 (\u03a9). Clearly\nthis \"phase-space\" observable always exists and has a special status: it gives full\ninformation about the classical system.\nRemember (from Section 2.1.5) that a quantum channel E can be used indirectly\nto map an observable X of the destination to the observable Y = X \u25e6E of the source.\nThe use of the dual map E \u2217 is implicit in this expression. Dualizing the equation\nwe obtain Y \u2217 = E \u2217 \u25e6 X \u2217 , which means Y \u2217 (\u03b1) = E \u2217 (X \u2217 (\u03b1)) for each proposition \u03b1.\nThe expression Y = X \u25e6 E is convenient because it expresses in a straightforward\nway that observing Y on the source is done by first applying the channel E and\nthen observing X.\nThe pointer observable \u0393 maps quantum states into classical states, and can\ntherefore be used to map a classical observable \u03c0 into a quantum observable X via\nthe equation X = \u03c0 \u25e6 \u0393. This means that measuring X amounts to first measuring\nthe observable represented by \u0393, and then measuring the classical observable \u03c0 on\nthe classical outcome of \u0393. Equivalently we have X \u2217 (\u03b1) = \u0393\u2217 (\u03c0 \u2217 (\u03b1)). Of course,\n\n\fNature of a classical limit\n\n89\n\n\u0393 itself is trivially the image of the special classical observable represented by the\nidentity on \u03a9: \u0393 = id \u25e6 \u0393.\nIf two classical observables are mapped to two quantum observables which do\nnot commute, then the classical observable representing their joint measurement is\nmapped to an unsharp quantum observable. For instance, the classical observable\n\"id\" mentioned above, which represents the joint measurement of all classical phasespace variables, is mapped to \u0393.\nNote that although \u0393 maps any classical observable to a quantum one, and every\nquantum state to a classical one, it does not in general attain all classical states.\nIndeed, the classical states that it can represent by quantum states will always\nsatisfy all the uncertainty relations. This is where the \"limit ~ \u2192 0\" is involved. It\ncomes as a second step which consists in artificially removing these constraints on\nstates, hence assuming that the classical observations are too inaccurate to notice\nthem.\nLet us study this through a standard example. Consider the case of a single\nfree electromagnetic mode. This quantum system is characterized by the Hilbert\nspace H = L2 (R), and its classical limit by a phase-space \u03a9 = R2 . We will denote\nthe points of phase space by pairs z = (p, q) where q will be called the \"position\"\nand p the \"momentum\".\nIn many physically important situations, we know that the classical pure states\ncharacterized by canonically conjugate pairs z = (q, p) \u2208 \u03a9 correspond to the\nquantum coherent states |zi.\nCoherent states are pure states in the Hilbert space H = L2 (R) which form a\ncomplete set, i.e.\nZ\n|zihz| dz = 1\nwhere\n\ndp dq\n.\n2\u03c0~\nThese states however are not orthogonal and do not form a basis. For our purpose,\nwe need only say that they are generated by acting on a fiducial vector |\u03c80 i with\nelements of the group of \"translations\" in phase-space:\ndz :=\n\n|zihz| = Uz |0ih0|Uz\u2217\nwhere, using the quantum operators qb and pb satisfying [b\nq , pb] = i~, we defined\ni\n\nUz := e\u2212 ~ (qbp+pbq) .\nThis group is a representation of the group of translations and \"boosts\" (i.e. translations in momentum). Note that this set of unitary operators does not close into\na group if we consider their action on vectors. Indeed, a non-trivial phase may\npop up due to the non-commutativity of pb and qb. However this phase is eliminated\nwhen the action on mixed states is considered, which is all that matters here.\n\n\f90\n\nDecoherence\n\nIn our language, this classical limit is defined by the observable \u0393, which maps\na quantum state \u03c1 to the classical state \u03bc := \u0393(\u03c1) defined by\n\u03bc(z) = hz|\u03c1|zi.\nThe effect of the dual map \u0393\u2217 is to send the classical effect \u03b1 \u2208 L\u221e (\u03a9) to the\nquantum effect\nZ\n\u2217\n\u0393 (\u03b1) =\n\u03b1(z)|zihz|dz.\n\u03a9\n\nWe can now play with this map and see how it transforms observables or states.\nFor instance consider the classical position observable Q, Rwhich maps a phasespace probability distribution \u03bc(q, p) to its marginal \u03bc(p) = \u03bc(q, p)dp. Its quantum version, Q \u25e6 \u0393, maps a quantum state \u03c1 to the marginal of the distribution\n\u03bc(q, p) = hq, p|\u03c1|q, pi. Its dual , which operates on effects \u03b1 \u2208 L\u221e (R), is given by\nZ\n\u2217\n(Q \u25e6 \u0393) (\u03b1) =\n\u03b1(q)|p, qihp, q|dz\n\u03a9\n\u0015\n\u0014Z\nZ\ndp\ndq\n= \u03b1(q)\n|p, qihp, q|\n2\u03c0~\nZ\n= \u03b1(q)Qq dq\nwhere we have defined the \"effect density\"\nZ\ndp\n.\nQq := |p, qihp, q|\n2\u03c0~\nThese operators are, in fact, simple functions of the sharp position operator qb.\nIndeed, using the position representation, we have\ni\n\ni\n\ni\n\nhx|0, pi = hx|e\u2212 ~ pbq |\u03c80 i = e\u2212 ~ pbq \u03c80 (x) = e\u2212 ~ px \u03c80 (x).\nwhich we can use to compute\nZ\ndp\nQq = |p, qihp, q|\n2\u03c0~\nZ\ndp\n= |xihx|p, qihp, q|x0 ihx0 |\ndx dx0\n2\u03c0~\n\u0015\nZ \u0014Z\n0 dp\n=\nhx|p, qihp, q|x i\n|xihx0 | dx dx0\n2\u03c0~\n\u0015\nZ \u0014Z\ndp\n0\n=\nhx \u2212 q|p, 0ihp, 0|x \u2212 qi\n|xihx0 | dx dx0\n2\u03c0~\n\u0015\nZ \u0014Z\n\u2212 ~i p(x\u2212x0 ) dp\n=\ne\nhx \u2212 q|\u03c80 ih\u03c80 |x0 \u2212 qi |xihx0 | dx dx0\n2\u03c0~\nZ\n= hx \u2212 q|\u03c80 ih\u03c80 |x \u2212 qi|xihx| dx = fq (x\u0302)\n\n\fNature of a classical limit\n\n91\n\ni\n\nwhere fq (x) := |hx|e\u2212 ~ qbp |\u03c80 i|2 .\nIf the fiducial vector \u03c80 (x) is localized at the origin, then we see that the observable Q \u25e6 \u0393, characterized by the operators Qq which play the role of continuous\nPOVM elements, is an approximate version of the sharp position observable represented by qb. In fact, it is likely that the set of operators Qq for all q generate the\nalgebra generated by qb, which essentially identifies qb. Of course the same is true\nfor the quantization P \u25e6 \u0393 of the classical momentum observable P .\nMore generally, consider a sharp real classical observable \u03c0f represented by a\nreal (possibly unbounded) function f on the phase-space R2 . The channel \u03c0f is\ndefined by\n(\u03c0f\u2217 (\u03b1))(z) = \u03b1(f (z))\nwhere \u03b1 is an effect in L\u221e (R). When composed with \u0393\u2217 it becomes the unsharp\nquantum observable Xf with dual\nXf\u2217 (\u03b1)\n\n=\u0393\n\n\u2217\n\n(\u03c0f\u2217 (\u03b1))\n\nZ\n=\n\n\u03b1(f (z)) |zihz| dz.\n\nIt is clear that any classical observable can be given a quantum version without\nany \"ordering ambiguity\".\nOf course, calling this \"quantization\" is far from being fair, given that we only\nreinterpreted a known quantum theory with a known classical limit. However,\nthe fact that most classical observables, even though they have no sharp quantum\nrepresentation, must have an unsharp one is an important point to make. Also,\nwe point out that when only the classical description of a system is known, there\nis a priori no reason to think that certain specific observables will have a sharp\nrepresentation in the quantum theory. That is, unless one is guided by some specific\nexperimental results involving, for instance, the quantization of the value of certain\nobservable, or some uncertainty relations. Such results are lacking in the case of\ngeneral relativity.\nIn addition, we note that, beside the choice of the dimension of our Hilbert\nspace, or the type of our von Neumann algebra, the map \u0393 really defines the\nquantum theory, given that it is what makes the link between abstract quantum\nobservables, which are nothing more than pure mathematical objects, and concrete\nclassical observable that we know how to measure and interpret. As we showed,\nspecifying \u0393 amounts to giving the quantization of all observables. In fact \u0393 itself\nis the quantization of the phase-space observable, which represents all that there is\nto know about the classical theory, apart from the dynamics.\nIn the rest of this chapter we will attempt to give a realistic picture of the\nemergence of a classical limit defined by an observable \u0393. The hope being that this\nprovides clues as to how, given the classical theory and its environment, one may\nattempt to guess the nature of the map \u0393 which essentially defines the quantum\ntheory.\n\n\f92\n\n5.2\n\nDecoherence\n\nSharp decoherence\n\nThe results presented in Chapter 3 give us a thorough understanding of the \"sharp\ninformation\" preserved by a quantum channel, i.e. the information represented by\nsharp observables. We will now make use of these results to generalize the simple\nexample of decoherence discussed in the introduction, in Section 1.3. Our analysis\nwill be based essentially on the results presented in Section 3.3.\nWe have seen that, if we are given a quantum channel E which describes the\nevolution of an open quantum system, there is a complementary channel Ec which\ndescribes the flow of information to the environment. The complementary channel\nis unique up to a unitary transformation of the environment. We have then shown\nthat the sharp observables preserved by E are precisely those which commute with\nall the effects (sharp and unsharp) preserved by Ec . It follows that the sharp\nobservables preserved by both channels must all commute with each other and\ntherefore form a commutative algebra C. Concretely, C is the intersection of the\nalgebras A and Ac correctable respectively for E and Ec : C := A \u2229 Ac . Since it\nis commutative, it characterizes classical information. This shows that the only\nsharp information which has been duplicated is classical. This can be understood\nas a version of the no-cloning theorem, with the addition that it tells us precisely\nwhich observable of the system represents the classical information which has been\nduplicated, namely the observable \u0393 which generates the commutative algebra C.\nNote that \u0393 is defined up to a measure-preserving bijective transformation of its\nspectrum, i.e. the phase-space.\nOne possible interpretation is the following. Suppose that E represents the time\nevolution of the system of interest. The algebra Ac represents properties of the\nsystem prior to the interaction. However, the part of Ac which is also preserved in\nthe system, namely C, also represents properties that the system possesses after the\ninteraction. Therefore C represents the information gathered by the environment\nand which has predictive power about the future state of the system. In the next\nsection we will show that each observable in C in fact implies the existence of\ncorrelations between the system and the environment after the interaction.\n\n5.2.1\n\nCorrelations\n\nConsider a \"duplicated\" sharp discrete observable X with effects Xi2 = Xi \u2208 C.\nSince this observable is preserved by both E and Ec , there exists an observable Y of\nthe system and an observable Z of the environment which are such that Xi = E \u2217 (Yi ),\nXi = Ec\u2217 (Zi ) for all i. Remember that this means that the information about the\nobservable X of the initial state of the system is represented by the observable Y of\nthe system after the interaction, and also by the observable Z of the environment\nafter the interaction. Hence the piece of information that it represents became\nredundant. We will show that the observables Y and Z are indeed correlated, and\ntherefore also contain information about each other.\n\n\fSharp decoherence\n\n93\n\nWe can \"purify\" the channel E with the isometry V such that\nXi = E \u2217 (Yi ) = V \u2217 (Yi \u2297 1)V\n\n(5.1)\n\nXi = Ec\u2217 (Zi ) = V \u2217 (1 \u2297 Zi )V.\n\n(5.2)\n\nand\nwhere V = U (1 \u2297 |\u03c8i), with the unitary operator U representing the joint evolution of the two interacting systems, and |\u03c8i the initial state of the environment\n(see Figure 3.1). These expressions are just the Heisenberg picture version of the\nrelations E(\u03c1) = Trenv (U (\u03c1 \u2297 |\u03c8ih\u03c8|)U \u2217 ) and Ec (\u03c1) = Trsys (U (\u03c1 \u2297 |\u03c8ih\u03c8|)U \u2217 ), where\nTrenv is the partial trace over the environment, and Trsys the partial trace over the\nsystem.\nConsider the first equation. If we multiply the left hand side by Xi\u22a5 on both\nsides, we obtain\n0 = Xi\u22a5 V \u2217 (Yi \u2297 1)V Xi\u22a5 .\nSince the \u221a\nright hand side is a positive operator,\u221aits square root must also be zero,\ni.e. 0 = ( Yi \u2297 1)V Xi\u22a5 or, by multiplying by ( Yi \u2297 1) on the left, and recalling\nthat Xi\u22a5 = 1 \u2212 Xi ,\n(Yi \u2297 1)V (1 \u2212 Xi ) = 0.\n(5.3)\nSimilarly we have Xi\u22a5 = (1\u2212Xi ) = V \u2217 ((1\u2212Yi )\u22971)V , which, by the same argument,\nimplies\n((1 \u2212 Yi ) \u2297 1)V Xi = 0.\n(5.4)\nCombining Equations 5.3 and 5.4, we obtain\n(Yi \u2297 1)V = V Xi .\nApplying the same reasoning to Equation 5.2 yields\n(1 \u2297 Zi )V = V Xi .\nCombing the two yields\n(Yi \u2297 Zj )V = V Xi Xj = \u03b4ij V Xi ,\nfrom which we have\nV \u2217 (Yi \u2297 Zj )V = \u03b4ij Xi .\n\n(5.5)\n\nThis last equation is the result that we were seeking: it means that Y and Z are\nentirely correlated. Indeed, for any state \u03c1 of the system,\nTr(V \u03c1V \u2217 (Yi \u2297 Zj )) = Tr(\u03c1V \u2217 (Yi \u2297 Zj )V ) = \u03b4ij Tr(\u03c1Xi )\nis the joint probability characterizing the joint measurement of Y and Z after\nthe interaction, and, as we can see thank to the Kronecker delta, the probability\nthat both measurements yield different outcomes is zero. It is straightforward to\ngeneralize this analysis to the case of continuous observables. We would then obtain\nthat\nV \u2217 (Y \u2217 (\u03b1) \u2297 Z \u2217 (\u03b2))V = X \u2217 (\u03b1)X \u2217 (\u03b2) = X \u2217 (\u03b1\u03b2).\nHence, for all states \u03c1,\nTr(V \u03c1V \u2217 (Y \u2217 (\u03b1) \u2297 Z \u2217 (\u03b2))) = Tr(\u03c1X \u2217 (\u03b1\u03b2)).\n\n\f94\n\n5.2.2\n\nDecoherence\n\nPredictability and objectivity\n\nThese results show that the only sharp information that the environment learns\nabout system, and which has any predictive power with respect to the outcome\nof some sharp measurement on the system after the interaction is classical. This\nclassical information can be characterized by a single observable \u0393: the pointer\nobservable (defined up to a measure-preserving bijective transformation of phasespace). Hence, in any interaction, some classical degrees of freedom of a quantum\nsystem are uniquely selected by the requirement that their information be sent to\nthe environment, and at the same time, be useful to predict properties of the system\nafter the interaction. From the point of view of an experimentalist who observes\nthe system indirectly by gathering information from the environment, the effective\nclassical system represented by \u0393 evolves deterministically. The other degrees of\nfreedom of the system can be simply ignored in this picture.\nWe note that our use of the notion of preserved, or correctable, information\nallows for the information represented by the pointer state to have in principle any\nnon-trivial evolution during the process of decoherence. Indeed, the fact that the\ninformation is preserved does not mean that it does not evolve.\nThis provides a possible model of the process of decoherence. The interesting\naspect of this picture is that it does not require any assumption about the interaction. This makes it universal. Nevertheless this model is limited by the fact that \u0393\nis sharp, and therefore cannot account for most classical limits. The next sections\nwill address this problem.\nThere is another possible way of interpreting the same technical results. First,\nwe note that the two channels that we considered need not be the exact complement\nof each other. Indeed, the results hold if the second channel considered only maps\nthe system to a subsystem of the environment. Consider the channel F defined by\nF \u2217 (A) := V \u2217 (1 \u2297 A \u2297 1)V\nwhere the second and third tensor factors correspond to two subsystems of the\nenvironment. Clearly, by comparing with Equation 5.2, we have\nF \u2217 (A) = Ec\u2217 (A \u2297 1)\nwhich implies that all the information preserved by F is also preserved by Ec .\nHence it is still true that the sharp observables preserved by both F and E form a\ncommutative algebra. In fact this is true of any couple of channels from the system\nto two different subsystems, be it part of the future state of the system or of the\nenvironment.\nGiven this fact, let us consider two channels F1 and F2 from the system to\ntwo different subsystems of the environment. The information about the system\npreserved by both observables is classical and characterized by a single observable\n\u0393 of the system. Therefore, a classical limit is selected simply by the condition\n\n\fSharp decoherence\n\n95\n\nthat it be represented redundantly in the environment. As stressed by Ollivier et\nal. [10, 14] (see also [11]), redundancy of representation is an important aspect\nof classical information, because it guarantees the objectivity of this information.\nIndeed, it allows two different observers to indirectly obtain the same information\nabout the system, without disturbing each other's observation in any way. This\nslightly different picture of the process of decoherence has the advantage of allowing\nfor the emergence of a classical system subject to noise. Indeed, the requirement\nof redundancy uniquely selects a classical limit without requiring the evolution of\nthe effective classical system to be deterministic. This will be analyzed in greater\ndetails for the more general model introduced in Section 5.5. For now, let us\njust mention that this particular model reproduces the main result of [10], namely\nthe selection of a sharp pointer observable through the requirement that it be\nrepresented redundantly in the environment. However our notion of redundancy is\nstronger because it does not only involves correlations at a given time, but it also\nrequires that this information represents a property that the system possessed at\nan earlier time.\n\n5.2.3\n\nExamples\n\nLet us show how this model reduces to the simple example mentioned in the introduction. We considered the channel E defined by\nX\nE(\u03c1) =\n|iihi|\u03c1|iihi|\ni\n\nwhere the vectors |ii form an orthonormal basis of a Hilbert space H. The correctable algebra A for this channel is the commutant of the algebra generated by the\noperators |iihi|jihj| = \u03b4ij |iihi|. These operators simply generate the commutative\nalgebras of operators diagonal in the basis |ii. This algebra is its own commutant,\nhence we see that the correctable algebra is already commutative, and characterized\nby the discrete sharp observable \u0393 with elements \u0393i = |iihi|.\nIn order to find the complementary channel, note that if V is an isometry\nresulting from the dilation of E, then |iihi| = (1 \u2297 h\u03c6i |)V , for some basis |\u03c6i i of the\nenvironment (Equation 3.12). This implies that the elements of the complementary\nchannel are\nX\nFi = (hi| \u2297 1)V =\n(hi| \u2297 |\u03c6j ih\u03c6j |)V\nj\n\n=\n\nX\n\n|\u03c6j i(hi| \u2297 h\u03c6j |)V =\n\nX\n\nj\n\n=\n\nX\n\n|\u03c6j ihi|(1 \u2297 h\u03c6j |)V\n\nj\n\n|\u03c6j ihi|jihj| = |\u03c6i ihi|.\n\nj\n\nTherefore the sharp information preserved by the complementary channel is characterized by the commutant the operators Fi\u2217 Fj = |iih\u03c6i |\u03c6j ihj| = \u03b4ij |iihi|, which\n\n\f96\n\nDecoherence\n\nis identical to the correctable algebra for E. Hence in this case A = Ac , so that\nC = A \u2229 Ac = A. This shows that the environment gathers information precisely\nabout the observable \u0393 which is preserved in the system. In this situation, the\neigenstates |ii of \u0393 are the pointer states usually referred to in the literature [5, 9].\nFor a slightly more general example, consider the channel\nX\nE(\u03c1) =\nU Pi \u03c1Pi U \u2217\n\n(5.6)\n\ni\n\nfor a unitary operator U and an complete family of orthogonal projectors Pi . The\ncorrectable algebra is given be the commutant of the operators Pi U \u2217 U Pj = Pi Pj =\n\u03b4ij Pi . This algebra is composed of all matrices which are block-diagonal in terms\nof the subspaces defined by the projectors Pi . Hence\nM\nA\u2248\nMnk\n(5.7)\ni\n\nwhere nk = Tr(Pk ). If any of the dimension nk is larger than 1, this algebra contains\nquantum information.\nIn order to compute the elements of the complementary channel, we will use a\nbasis {|\u03c8ji i}ij of the system which is an aggregate\nP of basis of the complementary\nsubspaces defined by the projectors Pi , i.e. Pi = j |\u03c8ji ih\u03c8ji |. The elements of the\ncomplementary channel then are, for some basis |\u03c6i i of the environment,\nX\nFij =\n|\u03c6k i(h\u03c8ji |U \u2217 )U Pk = |\u03c6i ih\u03c8ji |.\n(5.8)\nk\n\nTherefore, the algebra correctable for the complementary channel is the commutant\nof the operators\nFij\u2217 Fkl = |\u03c8ji ih\u03c6i |\u03c6k ih\u03c8lk | = \u03b4ik |\u03c8ji ih\u03c8li |.\nThese operators precisely span A. Therefore Ac = A0 , which implies that the\nintersection of A and Ac is the whole center of A:\nC = A \u2229 Ac = Z(A)\nwhich is the commutative algebra of operators of the form\nX\nA=\n\u03bb i Pi\n\n(5.9)\n\nn\n\nfor any \u03bbi \u2208 C. Hence the sharp information preserved in the system and transmitted to the environment is characterized by the discrete pointer observable \u0393 with\nelements \u0393i = Pi .\nNote that in this case, the concept of pointer state is not adapted to a description of the situation. Instead, we have a phenomenon of environment-induced\nsuperselection rules (einselection) [52]. Here \u0393 is the superselection charge.\n\n\fSharp decoherence\n\n97\n\nWe see that the unitary evolution characterized by the operator U plays no role\nin this analysis. This is because it does not remove or add any information to the\nsystem. This demonstrates an important feature of our framework, which is that\nit automatically identifies the original nature of the preserved information while\nneglecting any reversible change in its representation.\nWe can also look at how the decoherence gradually sets in, when time is introduced in the previous example. Consider the Hamiltonian\nH =A\u2297B\nPN\n\nwhere A := i=1 \u03bbi Pi with \u03bbi = Ti , and B generates cyclic shifts in the basis |\u03c6i i,\ni = 0, . . . , N of the environment, i.e.\ne\u2212\u0131B |\u03c6i i = |\u03c6(i+1 mod N ) i.\n\u221a\nNote that we will be using the symbol \u0131 = \u22121 for notational convenience.

At time t < T , the algebra\nof sharp observables preserved in the system is given by the commutant of the\noperators\nEk\u2217 (t)Ek0 (t) =\n\n1 X \u2212\u0131\u03c9(k\u2212k0 )t\u03bbi\ne\nPi\nN i\n\nwhich is the algebra A defined in Equation 5.7. Indeed, every single one of these\noperators for k 6= k 0 generates the algebra spanned by the projectors Pi , of which A\nis the commutant. To see this it suffices to note that for fixed k 6= k 0 , the coefficients\n0\ne\u2212\u0131\u03c9(k\u2212k )t\u03bbi are distinct for all i. This shows that the sharp information preserved in\nthe system at all time is the same. However, as we will see, the unsharp preserved\ninformation gets degraded until only the sharp preserved information is left.\nIn order to obtain the elements of the complementary channels, we choose as\ni\nbefore a basis\nP |\u03c8ij i ofi the system which is compatible with the projectors Pi , i.e. so\nthat Pi = j |\u03c8j ih\u03c8j |. The elements of the complementary channels then are\nFij (t) = (h\u03c8ji | \u2297 1)Vt =\n\n1 X \u2212\u0131\u03c9n(t\u03bbi \u2212k)\ne\n|\u03c6k ih\u03c8ji |\nN nk\n\nfrom which we have\n1 X \u0131\u03c9n(t\u03bbi \u2212k) \u2212\u0131\u03c9n0 (t\u03bbi0 \u2212k) i\n0\ne\ne\n|\u03c8j ih\u03c8ji 0 |\n2\nN nn0 k\n1 X \u0131\u03c9nt\u03bbi \u2212\u0131\u03c9n0 t\u03bbi0 1 X \u2212\u0131\u03c9(n\u2212n0 )k i\n0\n=\ne\ne\ne\n|\u03c8j ih\u03c8ji 0 |\nN nn0\nN k\n1 X \u0131\u03c9nt(\u03bbi \u2212\u03bbi0 ) i\n0\n=\ne\n|\u03c8j ih\u03c8ji 0 |.\nN n\n\nFij\u2217 (t)Fi0 j 0 (t) =\n\nWe want to show that for any time 0 \u2264 t < T , these operators\ngenerate the whole\nP \u0131\u03c9nt(\u03bb\ni \u2212\u03bbi0 )\nmatrix algebra. One can check that the coefficient \u03b3ii0 = n e\nis zero if\nt\n0\nand only if t(\u03bbi \u2212\u03bbi0 ) is an integer. Since \u03bbi \u2212\u03bbi0 = T (i\u2212i ), this cannot happen if t/T\nis irrational. Otherwise, if t/T = p/q for some integers p and q < N , then \u03b3ii0 = 0\nwhen i \u2212 i0 = q. If this happens, we are missing the matrix elements of the form\n\u2217\n0\n0\n|\u03c8ji ih\u03c8ji\u2212q\n0 | in the span of the operators Fij (t)Fi0 j 0 (t) for all i, i , j, j .

Therefore, when t < T , there is no non-trivial sharp\nobservable commuting with all the operators of the form Fij\u2217 (t)Fi0 j 0 (t), and hence\nno non-trivial sharp observable flowing to the environment.\nHowever there are non-trivial unsharp observables flowing to the environment.\nIn fact, we can see how one of these preserved unsharp observable becomes sharper\nwith time until it equals one of the projectors Pi . Indeed, let us find an observable\nof the environment that one should measure at time T in order to reproduce the\nstatistics of the observable with elements Pi . At time T the elements of the complementary channel are given by Equation 5.8. Using these, one can check that the\nsharp observable with elements Qk := |\u03c6k ih\u03c6k | does the job.

In particular this means that it cannot describe the emergence\nof a non-trivial phase-space. In Section 5.5 we will see that this picture can in fact\nbe generalized to unsharp pointer observables. However it will be instructive to first\nconsider a simpler generalization. For the moment we will ignore the environment,\nand attempt to understand what it means for a channel to destroy any information\nbut that represented by an unsharp observable.\n\n\f100\n\nDecoherence\n\nIn the previous section, we used the fact that the set of preserved sharp observables form a sub-algebra, and that, when this algebra is commutative, it represents\nan effective classical system. This idea does not work with unsharp observables,\nwhich are not associated with any algebra. Therefore we need to generalize what\nwe mean by a classical set of observables.\nWe want to understand when the set of observables preserved by a channel, or\neven any set of observables, can be said to characterize classical information. We\nhave already defined classical information as that represented by a physical system\nwhose set of effects belong to a commutative algebra. Hence, it is a priori natural\nto think of a classical set of quantum observables as that which is characterized\nby a commutative sub-algebra of the quantum algebra. However, we have seen in\nSection 5.1, that there exists much more general ways for a classical system to be\nrepresented by a quantum system. In general, the representation can be given by\na channel mapping quantum states into classical states, or equivalently by its dual\nwhich translates classical effects into quantum effects. This map, which is simply\nan observable, does not in general preserve the full structure of the commutative\nalgebra. Note that when it does, i.e. when it represents a sharp observable, it\nsingles out a commutative sub-algebra of the quantum algebra. If however it is\nnot a homomorphism, then it may map sharp observables into unsharp ones, and\ncommutative pairs of observables into non-commutative ones, which implies a certain loss of information. However this loss of information allows for fundamentally\ndifferent quantum representations of a classical system, as seen in Section 5.1.\nConsider an observable\n\u0393 : Bt (H) \u2192 L1 (\u03a9)\nwhich defines how our quantum system with Hilbert space H imperfectly represents\nthe classical system with phase-space \u03a9. This maps also represents every observables of the classical system by an observable of the quantum system. Indeed,\nconsider a classical observable\n\u03c0 : L1 (\u03a9) \u2192 L1 (\u03a90 )\nwhich is also simply a stochastic map between the two classical systems \u03a9 and \u03a90 .\nThis observable is represented by the quantum observable\nX = \u03c0 \u25e6 \u0393.\nMeasuring X amounts to first measuring \u0393, and then measuring \u03c0 on the classical\nsystem \u03a9 representing the outcome of the quantum measurement.\nTherefore, to the classical limit \u0393 is associated the set of observable of the form\nX = \u03c0 \u25e6 \u0393, for all classical observables \u03c0. Note that this is simply the set P\u0393 of\n\n\fClassical set of observables\n\n101\n\nobservables preserved by \u0393.\nBt (H)\n\n\u0393- 1\nL (\u03a9)\n\u03c0\n\nX\n-\n\n?\n\nL1 (\u03a90 )\nWe will also say that these observables are coarse-grainings of \u0393 since they\namount to measuring \u0393 and then forgetting about some aspects of the classical\nresult by applying the stochastic map \u03c0. In this sense, each of these observables\nrepresent less information than \u0393.\nWe will take this to be the prototype of a classical set of observable. In fact we\nwill say that a set of observable is classical if it belongs to such a set, i.e. if they\nare all coarse-grainings of a single observable \u0393.\nDefinition 5.1. We say of a set O of observables that it is classical if there is an\nobservable \u0393 and a family of stochastic maps \u03c0X , X \u2208 O such that\nX = \u03c0X \u25e6 \u0393 for all X \u2208 O.\nThis is equivalent to saying that the observables X \u2208 O are all preserved by \u0393, i.e.\nO \u2286 P\u0393 .\nNote that it would be tempting to characterize this set of observables by a set of\neffects, i.e. the set of coarse-grainings of \u0393 which take value in the set \u03a90 = {0, 1}.\nBut the counter-example used in Section 3.1 shows that this is not possible.\nAs an example, consider the set of observables defined by a commutative subalgebra A \u2286 Bt (H). In this case \u0393 can be chosen to be any sharp observable whose\nspectral projectors generate the commutative sub-algebra A. More concisely, \u0393 can\nb whose bounded functions generate A. If\nbe represented by a self-adjoint operator \u0393,\n\u0393 takes value in \u03a9\u0393 , i.e. \u0393 : A\u2217 \u2192 L1 (\u03a9\u0393 ), then the dual map \u0393\u2217 is a homomorphism\nof L\u221e (\u03a9\u0393 ) onto A. This means than a sharp observable X represented by a selfb \u2208 A is a coarse-graining of \u0393 in the following way. We know that\nadjoint operator X\nb = f (\u0393).\nb The function f is a mapping from\nthere is a real function f such that X\nthe spectrum \u03a9\u0393 of \u0393 to that of X. This means that the effects X \u2217 (\u03c7\u03c9 ) of X satisfy\nX \u2217 (\u03b1) = \u0393\u2217 (\u03b1\u25e6f ). We then define the stochastic map \u03c0 by \u03c0 \u2217 (\u03b1)(x) := \u03b1(f (x)) for\nall x \u2208 \u03a9\u0393 , so that we have X \u2217 (\u03b1) = \u0393\u2217 (\u03b1 \u25e6 f ) = \u0393\u2217 (\u03c0 \u2217 (\u03b1)) for all \u03b1, i.e. X = \u03c0 \u25e6 \u0393.\nFor instance, if \u0393 is sharp and discrete with elements \u03932i = \u0393i , then all the\noperators in the algebra\n\u0393 that it generates are represented by self-adjoint operators\nb = P\nof the form X\ni\u2208\u03a9\u0393 \u03bbi \u0393i . It is then clear that measuring \u0393 is as good as\nb All that one has to do to simulate a\nmeasuring the observable represented by X.\n\n\f102\n\nDecoherence\n\nb is to forget the distinction between the outcomes i and j in the\nmeasurement of X\ncase that \u03bbi = \u03bbj , an operation which can be represented by the stochastic matrix\n\u03c0 defined as follow. Let \u03a9 be the set of distinct values taken by the coefficients \u03bbi\nb The stochastic matrix \u03c0 is defined by \u03c0i\u03bb = 1\nfor all i, which is the spectrum of X.\ni\nfor all i \u2208 \u03a9\u0393 and 0 for all other components.\n\n5.3.1\n\nNon-contextuality\n\nOur definition of a classical set of observable is further justified by that fact that\nthey represent an effective theory which can be simulated by a non-contextual\nhidden variable model, in the sense defined in [53].\nSuppose that we have a physical system defined by a set of observables O\nand a set of states S. A non-contextual hidden variable model associates to each\nobservable X \u2208 O a classical observable \u03c0X , and, to each state \u03c1 \u2208 S, a classical\nstates \u03bc\u03c1 , in such a way that, when combined, these classical states and observables\nyield the same probability distributions as the quantum states and observables they\nrepresent.\nThe idea is that the model would be contextual with respect to preparations if\nthe classical state was a function not only of \u03c1 but also of the observable X, which\nwould mean that the particular state we must choose depends on the particular\nexperiment that we are going to perform. Correspondingly, it would be contextual\nwith respect to measurements if the classical observable to choose depended on the\nquantum state.\nIt is known that quantum theory cannot be given a non-contextual model. However, a classical set of quantum observables can. Indeed, this is precisely what the\nobservable \u0393 which characterizes our classical set does. Indeed, it maps any quantum state \u03c1 to a probability distribution \u03bc\u03c1 = \u0393(\u03c1) \u2208 L1 (\u03a9). In addition, each\nobservable X of the classical set is associated with a classical observable \u03c0X which\nis such that X = \u03c0X \u25e6 \u0393. This relation implies that the probability distribution\nX(\u03c1) is equal to one given by the effective classical theory, i.e. \u03c0X (\u03bc\u03c1 ). Indeed,\n\u03c0X (\u03bc\u03c1 ) = \u03c0X (\u0393(\u03c1)) = X(\u03c1).\n\n5.3.2\n\nFunctional coexistence\n\nThere exists a concept of coexistence between POVMs [54] which generalizes the\nnotion of commutativity for PVMs.\nRemember that an observable X defines a map X \u2217 from classical effects to\nquantum effects. When this map is restricted to sharp classical effects, which are\nall of the form \u03c7\u03c9 for some subset \u03c9 \u2286 \u03a9 of the phase-space \u03a9, then it defines a\nPOVM, which is a map from subsets \u03c9 to quantum effects. The effects of the form\nX \u2217 (\u03c7\u03c9 ) can therefore be said to be in the range of the POVM. A set of POVMs\n\n\fDecoherent channels\n\n103\n\nis called coexistent if the union of their range are all within the range of a single\nPOVM. To show that the observables in our \"classical\" set are coexistent, we first\nneed to prove a Lemma. We say that an observable X is a marginal of\nY : Bt (H) \u2192 L1 (\u03a91 ) \u2297 L1 (\u03a92 ) = L1 (\u03a91 \u00d7 \u03a92 )\nif X \u2217 (\u03b1) = Y \u2217 (\u03b1 \u2297 1), which means that measuring X amounts to measuring Y\nand then discarding the \u03a92 component of the result. The following then is true:\nLemma 5.1. Observables in a classical set are all marginals of a single observable.\nProof. Suppose that we have a set of observables O, which are all coarse-grainings\nof \u0393 : B(H) \u2192 L1 (\u03a9). For clarity, we will label the observables in O by a set \u03a3,\ni.e. O = {X\u03c3 | \u03c3 \u2208 \u03a3}. For all \u03c3 \u2208 \u03a3 there exists a channel \u03c0\u03c3 : L1 (\u03a9) \u2192 L1 (\u03a9\u03c3 ),\nwhere \u03a9\u03c3 is the set of values of X\u03c3 , such that X\u03c3 = \u03c0\u03c3 \u25e6 \u0393. Consider the channel\nO\nY\nL1 (\u03a9) = L1 ( \u03a9)\ncopy : L1 (\u03a9) \u2192\n\u03a3\n\n\u03a3\n\nN\n\ndefined by copy(\u03bc) = \u03a3 \u03bc. This channel produces as many copies of the state of\nthe classical system \u03a9 as there are elements in the set \u03a3. We use this to define the\nnew observable\nO \u0001\ne :=\n\u0393\n\u03c0\u03c3 \u25e6 copy \u25e6 \u0393\n\u03c3\u2208\u03a3\n\nwhich amounts to measuring \u0393, then duplicating the output as many times as there\nare elements in \u03a3, and finally applying \u03c0\u03c3 to the \u03c3's copy. It is then clear that\ne namely it amounts to measuring \u0393\ne and then\neach observable X\u03c3 is a marginal of \u0393,\ndiscarding all but the \u03c3's component of the outcome.\nThis almost directly shows that all coarse-grainings of a single observable \u0393\nare coexistent. Indeed, using the same objects as in Q\nthe above proof, we have\n\u2217\n\u2217\ne\ne contains all the elements of \u03a3 \u03a9 which have their \u03c3's\nX\u03c3 (\u03c7\u03c9 ) = \u0393 (\u03c7\u03c9e ), where \u03c9\ncomponent inside \u03c9.\nIn fact, this shows that the coarse-grainings of \u0393 are more than just coexistent.\nThey are alsoQfunctionally coexistent, which means that \u03c9\ne is related to \u03c9 by a\nfunction f : \u03a3 \u03a9 \u2192 \u03a9, i.e. \u03c9\ne = f \u22121 (\u03c9). Here the function is f (x) = x\u03c3 , and\nf \u22121 (\u03c9) denotes the pre-image of \u03c9 under f . In fact, it is also clearly true that\nfunctionally coexistent observables form a classical set. Therefore we have the\nfollowing:\nProposition 5.2. Observables form a classical set if and only if they are functionally coexistent.\n\n5.4\n\nDecoherent channels\n\nEquipped with our definition of a classical set of observables, we can now define a\nfully decoherent channel E as one whose preserved set of observables PE is classical,\n\n\f104\n\nDecoherence\n\ni.e.\nPE \u2286 P\u0393\nfor some observable \u0393. The observable \u0393 then is the pointer observable characterizing the decoherence process.\nDefinition 5.2. A channel E is said to be fully decoherent in terms of the pointer\nobservable \u0393 if all its preserved observables are coarse-grainings of \u0393.\nIt may be convenient to visualize this definition by combining the commutative\ndiagrams which state that X is preserved by both E and \u0393:\nBt (H1 )\n\u0393\n\nEBt (H2 )\nY\n\nX\n\n-\n\n?\n\nL1 (\u03a9)\n\n?\n\n\u03c0\n\n-\n\nL1 (\u03a90 )\n\nThis can be read as follows. Imagine that the channel E and the classical limit\n\u0393 are given, and disregard the diagonal X. The condition for \u0393 to be a pointer\nobservable selected by E is that for every observable Y , \u03c0 exists to complete the\nsquare.\nIn general, if PE 6= P\u0393 , the pointer observable \u0393 is not unique. For instance, it\ncould be that the channel preserves no information at all, which would mean that\nthe preserved observables are only those whose effects are proportional to the identity. In this case, absolutely any observable could serve as the pointer observable,\naccording to the above definition. The idea is that in this case any observable would\nyield a consistent classical interpretation of this information, albeit admitting only\nmaximally mixed quantum states. In general, the description based on a pointer\nobservable \u0393 contains more information than what has actually been preserved by\nthe channel. Therefore, the arbitrariness in the choice of the pointer observable corresponds to the arbitrariness of the added information in the classical description.\nIn fact we may expect that, in realistic systems, the differences between various\nchoices of the pointer observable vanish when the accuracy with which the observer\ncan resolve the classical observables is small compared to ~.\n\n5.4.1\n\nExample: entanglement-breaking channels\n\nAs an example, consider all channels with rank-one elements, i.e. of the form\nE(\u03c1) =\n\nX\ni\n\n\u03bbi |\u03c8i ih\u03c6i |\u03c1|\u03c6i ih\u03c8i |\n\n\fDecoherent channels\n\n105\n\nwhere the states |\u03c8i i and |\u03c6i i are arbitrary, apart from the condition that E \u2217 (1) = 1,\nwhich implies that\nX\n\u03bbi |\u03c6i ih\u03c6i | = 1.\ni\n\nThis is the general form of the entanglement-breaking channels in finite-dimensions\n[55]. Channels of this form are fully decoherent, with discrete pointer observable \u0393\ndefined by its elements\n\u0393i = \u03bbi |\u03c6i ih\u03c6i |.\nIndeed, an observable X preserved by E has the form\nX\nX \u2217 (\u03b1) =\n\u03bbi |\u03c6i ih\u03c8i |Y \u2217 (\u03b1)|\u03c8i ih\u03c6i |\ni\n\nfor some observable Y . Therefore,\nX\nX \u2217 (\u03b1) =\nh\u03c8i |Y \u2217 (\u03b1)|\u03c8i i \u0393i = \u0393\u2217 (\u03c0 \u2217 (\u03b1))\ni\n\nwhere the classical channel \u03c0 is defined by\n\u03c0 \u2217 (\u03b1)i = h\u03c8i |Y \u2217 (\u03b1)|\u03c8i i.\nTo see that this map \u03c0 is a valid channel, note first that it is manifestly positive\nand unital. In addition, it is the dual of the map\nX\n\u03c0(\u03bc)i = Y (\n\u03bci |\u03c8i ih\u03c8i |)\ni\n\non states, and is therefore normal. Note that such channels were already studied in\nSection 3.4. In particular, the sets of effects represented in Figure 3.2 are examples\nof classical sets.\nIf the sum is replaced by an integral over a continuous set of states, the resulting\nchannel has the same properties. An example of such a channel is given in Section\n5.4.3 below.\n\n5.4.2\n\nCovariant decoherent channels\n\nThe above considerations about the freedom in the choice of the pointer observable\n\u0393 can be made more concrete in the case where the channel E is covariant with\nrespect to a unitary representation U : g \u2208 G \u2192 Ug of a compact Lie group G. The\nchannel E is said to be covariant with respect to this group if there exists another\nunitary representation V : g \u2192 Vg which is such that, for all g \u2208 G,\nE(Ug \u03c1Ug\u2217 ) = Vg E(\u03c1)Vg\u2217 .\n\n\f106\n\nDecoherence\n\nNow suppose that this channel is fully decoherent, in the above sense, in terms\nof some pointer observable\n\u03930 : Bt (H) \u2192 L1 (\u03a9)\nThis means that for all observables X there exists a classical observable \u03c0X such\nthat for all effects \u03b1,\n\u2217\n(\u03b1))\nE \u2217 (X \u2217 (\u03b1)) = \u0393\u22170 (\u03c0X\nbut then we also have, for all g \u2208 G,\nE \u2217 (X \u2217 (\u03b1)) = E \u2217 (Vg\u2217 Vg X \u2217 (\u03b1)Vg\u2217 Vg ) = Ug\u2217 E \u2217 (Vg X \u2217 (\u03b1)Vg\u2217 )Ug\n\u2217\n= Ug\u2217 \u0393\u2217 (\u03c0gX\n(\u03b1))Ug\n\n(5.10)\n\nwhere, by gX we mean the observable defined by\n(gX)\u2217 (\u03b1) := Vg X \u2217 (\u03b1)Vg\u2217\nEquation 5.10 means that the preserved observables are not only coarse-grainings\nof \u0393, but are also coarse-grainings of any observable of the form\n\u0393\u2217g (\u03b1) := Ug\u2217 \u0393\u22170 (\u03b1)Ug .\nThis shows an example of ambiguity in the choice of the pointer observable. However, it may be that the pointer observable \u0393 is such that \u0393g is equivalent to \u0393 up\nto a relabelling of its values \u03a9. This would mean that \u0393 itself is covariant with\nrespect to G in the sense that there exists an action \u03bb of G on \u03a9 which is such\nthat \u0393g (\u03b1) = \u03930 (\u03b1 \u25e6 \u03bbg ). In fact we can always build a pointer observable \u0393 which\nis covariant in this way. It is, in a sense, and average of each \u0393g over the Haar\nmeasure. More precisely, we define \u0393 by\nZ\nZ\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u0393 (\u03b1) := \u0393g (\u03b1g ) dg = Ug\u2217 \u0393\u22170 (\u03b1g )Ug dg.\nwhere \u03b1 \u2208 L\u221e (G) \u2297 L\u221e (\u03a9), \u03b1g (x) := \u03b1(g,\nR x) for all x \u2208 \u03a9. The invariant Haar\nmeasure dg on G is normalized such that dg = 1. This observable is covariant for\nthe group G with respect to the action \u03bb on G \u00d7 \u03a9 defined by the right-action\n\u03bbh (g, x) := (gh\u22121 , x)\nfor all h \u2208 G and x \u2208 \u03a9. Indeed, we have\nZ\nZ\n\u2217 \u2217\n\u2217 \u2217\nUh \u0393 (\u03b1)Uh = Ugh \u03930 (\u03b1g )Ugh dg = Ug\u2217 \u0393\u22170 (\u03b1gh\u22121 )Ug dg\nZ\n= Ug\u2217 \u0393\u22170 (\u03b1g \u25e6 \u03bbh )Ug dg = \u0393(\u03b1 \u25e6 \u03bbh ).\nWe still have to show that, indeed, all observables preserved by E are coarsegrainings of \u0393, so that it can serve as a pointer observable. Given an observable X\n\n\fDecoherent channels\n\n107\n\ntaking value in the set \u03a9X ,\n\u2217\n\nZ\n\n\u2217\n\nE \u2217 (X \u2217 (\u03b1)) dg\n\nE (X (\u03b1)) =\nZ\n\n\u2217\n(\u03b1))Ug dg\nUg\u2217 \u0393\u2217 (\u03c0gX\n\n=\n\u2217\n\n= \u0393 (\u03a0\u2217X (\u03b1))\nwhere we have defined the classical observable\n\u03a0X : L1 (G) \u2297 L1 (\u03a9) \u2192 L1 (\u03a9X )\nby\n\u2217\n\u03a0\u2217X (\u03b1)(g, x) := \u03c0gX\n(\u03b1)(x).\n\n5.4.3\n\nExample: coherent states\n\nLet us give an example of a channel decoherent in terms of an unsharp pointer\nobservable. We will use the setting of a Hilbert space H which contains coherent\nstates |zi = |q, pi generated from a fiducial vector |\u03c80 i, as in Section 5.1.1. We\nconsider the channel E defined by\nZ\nE(\u03c1) = |zihz|\u03c1|zihz|dz\n(5.11)\nor\n\nZ\n\n\u2217\n\nE (A) =\n\n|zihz|A|zihz|dz.\n\nThis channel is of the form of the class of examples studied in Section 3.4, apart\nfrom the fact that the sum has been replaced by an integral. An observable X\nwhich is preserved by this channel is of the form\nZ\n\u2217\nX (\u03b1) = |zihz|Y \u2217 (\u03b1)|zihz|dz.\nfor some observable Y . It is immediately clear that this observable is a coarsegraining of the coherent-state observable \u0393 studied in Section 5.1.1. Indeed, remember that\nZ\n\u2217\n\u0393 (\u03b1) = \u03b1(z)|zihz|dz.\nHence, we have\n\u2217\n\nZ\n\nX (\u03b1) =\n\n\u2217\n\nhz|Y (\u03b1)|zi|zihz|dz =\n\nZ\n\n(\u03c0 \u2217 (\u03b1))(z) |zihz|dz\n\n= \u0393\u2217 (\u03c0 \u2217 (\u03b1)).\nwhere we have defined the stochastic map \u03c0 by\n\u03c0 \u2217 (\u03b1)(z) = hz|Y \u2217 (\u03b1)|zi.\n\n\f108\n\nDecoherence\n\nNote that \u03c0 \u2217 is positive and unital. In addition it is normal, because it is the dual\nof\nZ\n\u03c0(\u03bc) = Y ( \u03bc(z)|zihz|dz)\nR\nwhich is well-defined\nR \u03c1 := \u03bc(z)|zihz|dz is trace-class. Indeed, for a\nP given that\nbasis |ii, we have i hi|\u03c1|ii = \u03bc(z) dz = 1.\nTherefore we have in this example that PE \u2286 P\u0393 . However, we do not have\nequality between these sets. Indeed, \u0393 itself is not preserved by the channel. Ine of the form \u0393\ne := \u0393 \u25e6 E which, more\nstead, the closest we can get is an observable \u0393\nexplicitly, has the form\nZ\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\ne\n\u0393 (\u03b1) = E (\u0393 (\u03b1)) = \u03b1(z) |zihz|z 0 ihz 0 |zihz| dz dz 0\nZ\n= \u03b1(z) |hz|z 0 i|2 |zihz| dz dz 0 .\nThis observable can be understood as an approximate form of the observable \u0393.\nFor instance, if the fiducial state |\u03c80 i that we used to define the coherent states is\na Gaussian then so is |hz|z 0 i|2 , which shows that if \u03b1(z) is peaked around z, then\ne\u2217 (\u03b1) is given by a Gaussian smearing of coherent states around z, instead of the\n\u0393\ne itself is not sufficient to characterize PE .\ncoherent state |zihz| itself. However, \u0393\nIndeed, P\u0393e does not contain the whole of PE .\nNote that this channel E is clearly covariant with respect to the group of translations and boosts in phase-space, which was used to generate the coherent states.\nHowever, we cannot use this fact to generate other pointer states from \u0393, given\nthat \u0393 is already covariant with respect to this group.\nIn conclusion, the channel defined by Equation 5.11 yields an example of how a\nrealistic classical limit can emerge dynamically from decoherence. We note that the\nemergence of phase-space through decoherence has been studied before [15, 9], however this is the first model which allows in principle for the possibility of a derivation\nof the structure of the emergent phase-space. Indeed, all other approaches attempt\nto show that a given classical description is consistent, without excluding other\npossible classical descriptions. Although our description may also have a certain\nambiguity in the choice of the pointer observable \u0393, the main properties of the\nclassical description should come from the features encoded in the well-defined set\nPE .\nAnother advantage of this picture is that it enables us to study the transfer of\ninformation to the environment, as we will show in the next section.\n\n5.5\n\nDecoherence from broadcasting\n\nIn Section 3.3, we showed that sharp preserved observables which are duplicated\ntwice must form a classical set. We exploited this fact in Section 5.2 in order\n\n\fDecoherence from broadcasting\n\n109\n\nto provide a model of decoherence in terms of a sharp pointer observable. In\nthe previous section we familiarized ourselves with the idea of an unsharp pointer\nobservable. We will now try to generalize the result of Section 5.2 to unsharp\nobservables in order to have a full-fledged picture of decoherence. However, we will\nsee that in the case of unsharp observables, it is not sufficient to duplicate them\ntwice in order to make sure that they form a classical set. A counter example will\nbe provided in Section 5.5.2. Instead, we will show that the unsharp observables\nwhich are duplicated an arbitrary number of times must form a classical set. Our\nproof however will assume that we are dealing with a finite-dimensional quantum\nsystem.\nWe consider a channel E from the system with Hilbert space HA to an infinite\nnumber of subsystems HB1 , HB2 , HB3 , . . . of the environment.\nE : Bt (HA ) \u2192 Bt (HB1 \u2297 HB2 \u2297 . . . )\n\n(5.12)\n\nIf needed, the infinite tensor product Hilbert space can be made separable by keeping only basis elements with a finite number of factors different from a special state\nselected in each HBi [56]. The flow of information from A to the ith system Bi is\ndescribed by the channel\nEi : Bt (HA ) \u2192 Bt (HBi )\ndefined by\nEi (\u03c1) = Tr0i E(\u03c1)\n\n(5.13)\n\nwhere Tr0i is the partial trace over all subsystems but the ith. We want to characterize the information which is preserved by all these channels at the same time.\nThis information is encoded in the set of observables which are preserved by all the\nchannels:\n\\\nI=\nPE i\ni\n\nWe will say that the observables in this set are broadcast. We can show that any\ncountable set {Xi } \u2282 I is classical, in the sense that all the observables in it\nare coarse-grainings of a single observable (see Section 5.3). Indeed, let Yi be the\nobservable such that Xi = Yi \u25e6 Ei , which exists thank to the assumption that Xi is\npreserved by Ei . Then consider the observable\n\u0393 := (Y1 \u2297 Y2 \u2297 . . . ) \u25e6 E.\nIt is clear that all the observables Xi are marginals of \u0393. Indeed, measuring \u0393\nand then discarding all classical output subsystems but the ith is equivalent to\nmeasuring Yi \u25e6 Ei = Xi . This proves that {Xi } \u2282 P\u0393 . Note that any coarse-graining\nor convex combination of these observables Xi is also in P\u0393 .\nIf the set I was separable with respect to a certain topology T, then we would\nhave that {Xi } can be chosen to be dense in I, so that\nI \u2286 P\u0393\n\n\f110\n\nDecoherence\n\nwhere the horizontal bar denotes closure with respect to the topology T. This would\nshow that a single observable \u0393 suffices to simulate the broadcast observables in I\nto arbitrary precision (with respect to T), and therefore that the set I is classical,\nand characterized by the pointer observable \u0393, in this somewhat more general sense.\nThe set I can be made separable under the following assumptions\n1. It includes only observable taking value in a single set \u03a9. For instance, one\ncould pick the disjoint union \u03a9 = R \u222a N in order to include both continuous\nand discrete observables.\n2. The source Hilbert space HA (on which the observables in I are defined), is\nfinite-dimensional.\nThe finite dimensionality of HA in fact guarantees that the whole set of observables\nof the form X : Bt (HA ) \u2192 L1 (\u03a9) is separable. Indeed, consider a basis \u03c3i of Bt (H).\nEach observable X is entirely characterized by its components X(\u03c3i ) \u2208 L1 (\u03a9).\nGiven that there is a finite number of them, and that L1 (\u03a9) itself is separable, the\nset of all these observables is also separable. The topology T which is involved here\nis defined by the metric\nd(X, Y ) = max kX(\u03c3i ) \u2212 Y (\u03c3i )k1\ni\n\n(5.14)\n\nwhere k * k1 is the norm in L1 (\u03a9).\nThis proves the following:\nTheorem 5.3. Let E be a channel of the form specified by Equation 5.12, with the\nsource Hilbert space HA finite-dimensional. Then the set I\u03a9 of observables with\nvalues in a given measure space \u03a9, which are preserved by all the partial channels\nEi , can be approximated arbitrarily well by coarse-grainings of a single observable\n\u0393, in terms of the distance defined by Equation 5.14.\nWe will look at the consequences of this result in Section 5.6. But first, let us\nexamine the question of the correlations induced by unsharp preserved observables.\n\n5.5.1\n\nCorrelations\n\nIn Section 5.2.1 we showed that a sharp observable which is duplicated twice implies the existence of exact correlations between the two destination systems. For\nunsharp observables, the correlation will in general not be exact. However, there\nare cases where the correlation is exact even for genuinely unsharp observables. To\nshow this, let us give a slightly more general form of the result derived in Section\n5.2.1.\nConsider a discrete observable X with effects Xi . Suppose that for each i, Pi is\na projector satisfying\nPi\u22a5 Xi Pi\u22a5 = 0.\n\n\fDecoherence from broadcasting\n\n111\n\nWe will assume that this observable X is preserved by two channels E1 and E2\nwhich are given by two different partial traces of the same channel E. For instance\nthey could be any pairs of channel Ei defined in Equation 5.13. Hence, there exists\nobservables Y and Z which are such that Xi = E1\u2217 (Yi ), Xi = E2\u2217 (Zi ) for all i.\nWe have\nXi = E \u2217 (Yi \u2297 1) = E \u2217 (1 \u2297 Zi )\n\n(5.15)\n\nIf we multiply by Pi\u22a5 on both sides in each term, we obtain\n0 = Pi\u22a5 E \u2217 (Yi \u2297 1)Pi\u22a5 = Pi\u22a5 E \u2217 (1 \u2297 Zi )Pi\u22a5 .\nIf Ek are the elements of the channel E, then using Lemma 3.2 we get\n(Yi \u2297 1)Ek = (1 \u2297 Zi )Ek = Ek Pi\nTogether, these two equations yield\n(Yi \u2297 Zj )Ek = (Yi \u2297 Zj )Ek (Pi Pj )n\nwhere n is an arbitrary integer. In the limit for n \u2192 \u221e, we get a new projector\nPij on the right-hand side which projects on the intersection of the subspaces corresponding to Pi and Pj . Hence, if our observable X is such that Pi and Pj project\non subspaces with trivial intersections, then\n(Yi \u2297 Zj )Ek = (Yi \u2297 Zj )Ek \u03b4ij Pi\nwhich implies that whenever i 6= j,\nE \u2217 (Yi \u2297 Zj ) = 0.\nHence Y and Z are fully correlated. Note that we had to assume that the supports\nof the effects Xi all have trivial intersections. This happens for instance if Xi \u221d\n|\u03c8i ih\u03c8i | and the states |\u03c8i i are all distinct (but not necessarily orthogonal).\nMore generally, we do not expect that a duplicated unsharp observable will\nalways induce exact correlations between the target systems. However, we expect\nthat the amount of correlations between Y and Z is related to the information\ncontent of the observable X, as defined in Section 2.1.3.\n\n5.5.2\n\nNon-classical two-fold broadcasting\n\nWe showed that sharp observables must form a classical set when duplicated twice.\nFor unsharp observables however, we showed that they form a classical set under\nthe assumption of an infinite quantity of copies (Theorem 5.3). Can we arrive at\nthe same conclusion under a weaker assumption, in the unsharp case? Here we\ngive an example which shows that, unlike for the sharp case, two copies are not\nsufficient1 .\n1\n\nThis example was suggested to the author by A. Winter.\n\n\f112\n\nDecoherence\n\nConsider the isometry V which embeds a three dimensional Hilbert space H\ninto the antisymmetric subspace of the tensor product H \u2297 H as\nV =\n\nX 1\n\u221a \u000fijk |ijihk|\n2\nijk\n\nwhere \u000fijk is the totally antisymmetric tensor (in three dimensions), and |ii, i \u2208\n0, 1, 2 are an orthonormal basis of H, and |iji := |ii \u2297 |ji. If we trace out one of\nthe space H after the action of the isometry, we obtain a channel whose dual is\nE \u2217 (A) = V \u2217 (A \u2297 1)V\n1 X\n\u000fijk \u000fi0 j 0 k0 |kihij|(A \u2297 1)|i0 j 0 ihk 0 |\n=\n2 ijki0 j 0 k0\n1 X\n\u000fijk \u000fi0 jk0 |kihi|A|i0 ihk 0 |\n=\n2 ijki0 k0\n1X\n=\n(\u03b4ii0 \u03b4kk0 \u2212 \u03b4ik0 \u03b4ki0 )|kihi|A|i0 ihk 0 |\n2 iki0 k0\n1X\n|kihi|A|iihk| \u2212 |kihi|A|kihi|\n=\n2 ik\n1\n= (Tr(A)1 \u2212 AT )\n2\nwhere AT is the transpose of A seen as a matrix with respect to the basis |ii. By\nconstruction, it is clear that this map is completely positive and unital, and that\nE = Ec\nsince tracing-out the other destination subsystem yields exactly the same channel.\nTherefore, the whole set of observables preserved by E is also preserved by Ec and\nis therefore duplicated.\nLet us suppose that the set of preserved observable is classical, i.e. that there\nexists an observable \u0393 such that all preserved observables are coarse-grainings of \u0393.\nWe want to reach a contradiction.\nFirst, let us show that the channel E is covariant for the whole unitary group\nU(H). Indeed, for any unitary U on H we have\n1\nE \u2217 (U \u2217 AU ) = (Tr(U \u2217 AU )1 \u2212 (U \u2217 AU )T )\n2\n1\n= (Tr(A)1 \u2212 U T AT U )\n2\n1\n= (Tr(A)1 \u2212 U T AT U )\n2\n\u2217\n= U E \u2217 (A)U\n\n\fDecoherence from broadcasting\n\n113\n\nwhere U is the complex conjugate of U , which is also a unitary operator. In fact,\ng 7\u2192 U g is also a representation of the group.\nAs seen in Section 5.4.2, this implies that there is a covariant pointer observable\n\u0393, defined by\nZ\n\u2217\n\nU \u2217 \u0393\u2217 (\u03b1U )U dU.\n\n\u0393 (\u03b1) =\n\nwhere \u03b1U (x) := \u03b1(U, x) for all U \u2208 U(H) and x \u2208 \u03a9, the set in which \u0393 takes value.\nthis observable \u0393 is covariant in terms of the representation \u03bb on U(H) \u00d7 \u03a9 defined\nby\n\u03bbU (V, x) = (V U \u2217 , x)\nfor any unitary operators U, V and any x \u2208 \u03a9.\nIn fact we can build a covariant pointer observable which is more generic that \u0393.\nFirst, note that each matrix element hi|\u0393\u2217 (\u03b1)|ji defines a normal linear map from\nL\u221e (\u03a9) to C, i.e. it can be associated with an element \u03bcij of the pre-dual L1 (\u03a9)\nsuch that\nZ\n\u2217\nhi|\u0393 (\u03b1)|ji =\n\u03bcij (U, x) \u03b1(U, x) dx.\n\u03a9\n\nFor each x we can build the matrix\n\u0393x :=\n\nX\n\n\u03bcij (x)|iihj|.\n\nij\n\nWe then have\n\nZ\n\n\u2217\n\n\u03b1(x)\u0393x dx\n\n\u0393 (\u03b1) =\n\u03a9\n\nThe operators \u0393x are the continuous equivalent of the elements\nP x of a discrete xPOVM.\nIf we diagonalize these operators we obtain \u0393x =\ni \u03bbi |iihi|x where \u03bbi is the\neigenvalue of \u0393x with eigenstate |iix . We pick unitary operators Uix which are such\nthat |iix = Uix |0i, where |0i is some fixed arbitrary state.\nRecall that given our assumptions, for each observable X there is a stochastic\n\u2217\nmap \u03c0 such that E \u2217 (X \u2217 (\u03b1)) = \u0393 (\u03c0 \u2217 (\u03b1)). Expanding the right-hand side of this\nequation, we obtain\nZ\n\u2217\n\u2217\nE (X (\u03b1)) = U \u2217 \u0393\u2217 ((\u03c0 \u2217 (\u03b1))U )U dU.\nZ\n= (\u03c0 \u2217 (\u03b1))(U, x)U \u2217 \u0393x U dU dx.\nZ\nX\n= (\u03c0 \u2217 (\u03b1))(U, x)\n\u03bbxi U \u2217 Uix |0ih0|(Uix )\u2217 U dU dx\ni\n\n=\n=\n\nZ X\n\n(\u03c0 \u2217 (\u03b1))(Uix V, x)\u03bbxi V \u2217 |0ih0|V dV dx\n\ni\nZ \"X Z\n\n\u2217\n\ni\n\u2217\n\n#\n(\u03c0\n\n= \u2206 (\u03a0 (\u03b1))\n\n\u2217\n\n(\u03b1))(Uix V, x)\u03bbxi\n\ndx V \u2217 |0ih0|V dV\n\n\f114\n\nDecoherence\n\nwhere we have defined the observable\n\u2206 : B(H) \u2192 L1 (U(H))\nby\n\u2217\n\nZ\n\n\u2206 (\u03b1) := 3\n\n\u03b1(U )U \u2217 |0ih0|U dU\n\nand the stochastic map (or classical observable)\n\u03a0 : L1 (U(H)) \u2192 L1 (\u03a9X )\nby\n1X\n(\u03a0 (\u03b1))(U ) :=\n3 i\n\u2217\n\nZ\n\n(\u03c0 \u2217 (\u03b1))(Uix U, x)\u03bbxi dx.\n\nSince all preserved observable must be coarse-grainings of \u2206, then in particular,\nwe must have that\nZ\n1\n\u2217\nE (|iihi|) = (1 \u2212 |iihi|) = 3 \u03b1(U ) U \u2217 |0ih0|U dU.\n(5.16)\n2\nfor some effect \u03b1 in L\u221e (U(H)). But this is not possible. Indeed, we would have\nZ\n\u03b1(U ) hi|U \u2217 |0ih0|U |ii dU = 0\nwhich implies that for all U , either \u03b1(U ) = 0 or h0|U |ii = 0. Hence the integral\nin Equation 5.16 is supported on the set of unitary operators U which are such\nthat h0|U |ii = 0. But this set is of measure zero. This means that we must have\nE \u2217 (|iihi|) = 0, which contradicts the hypothesis. Therefore the set of preserved\nobservables in this example is not classical, even though it has been duplicated\ntwice.\n\n5.5.3\n\nExample: symmetric broadcasting\n\nWe consider the optimal fully symmetric quantum cloning machine introduced in\n[57]. This is a channel which approximately copies n to m qubits without discrimination in favour of any state, and with optimal fidelity. In the case n = 1, each\n(m)\nindividual channel Ek resulting from tracing out all destinations qubits but one,\nis of the form\n1\n(m)\nEk (\u03c1) = \u03b1m \u03c1 + (1 \u2212 \u03b1m ) Tr(\u03c1) 1.\n2\nIn the limit of an infinite number of copies (m \u2192 \u221e), the parameter \u03b1 tends to\n\u03b1\u221e = 13 :\n1\n2\n1\n(\u221e)\nEk (\u03c1) := Ek (\u03c1) = \u03c1 + Tr(\u03c1) 1.\n3\n3\n2\n\n\fDecoherence from broadcasting\n\n115\n\nSince these channels are identical for every k, the information preserved by one of\nthem is also preserved by all the other channels. Therefore I = PEk for any k. Note\nthat Ek\u2217 is invertible. This means that we can apply Proposition 3.1, which states\nthat the observables preserved by Ek are those whose effects are all preserved.\nWe will show that the preserved effects Ek\u2217 (E(H)) are all coarse-grainings of\nany of the symmetric informationally complete (SIC) POVMs [58]. A POVM is\nsaid to be informationally complete if its elements Xi span the space of density\noperators, which implies that its statistics entirely determines the state. Indeed,\nthe component of a state \u03c1 associated with the basis element Xi is given by the scalar\nproduct Tr(\u03c1Xi ) which is also the probability for the ith outcome in a measurement\nof X.\nFor a qubit, such a POVM must have at least four elements. Indeed, the Hermicity condition on states selects a four dimensional subspace of the space of matrices.\nNote that the condition that the trace be unity, although it does reduce the dimension of the manifold of states to three, does not do so in a linear fashion. An\ninformationally complete POVM is further said to be symmetrical if the scalar\nproduct Tr(Xi Xj ) is the same for all pairs of distinct POVM elements. In addition,\none usually assumes that the elements Xi are of rank one.\nFor a qubit, a SIC-POVM \u0393 has elements {\u03930 , \u03931 , \u03932 , \u03933 } which are proportional\nto projectors onto four pure states |\u03c8i i. If we represent these states in the Bloch\nsphere, i.e. in terms of their traceless components \u03bbij = Tr((|\u03c8i ih\u03c8i | \u2212 21 1)\u03c3j ) where\n\u03c3j , j = 1, . . . , 3 are the Pauli operators, these states correspond to the vertices of\na regular tetrahedron inscribed in the Bloch sphere.\nThe set of effects preserved by \u0393 is\nX\n\u0393\u2217 (E(\u03a9)) = {\n\u03b1i \u0393i | 0 \u2264 \u03b1i \u2264 1}.\ni\u2208\u03a9\n\nwhere \u03a9 = {0, 1, 2, 3}. Let us picture this convex set in the space of Hermitian\nmatrices spanned by the Pauli basis {1, \u03c31 , \u03c32 , \u03c33 }. Note first that the boundary of\nthe set E(H) of all the quantum effects is a double cone with tips at 0 and 1. The\nintersection of the two cones is the Bloch sphere in the 3-sub-manifold of trace-one\noperators (i.e. with component 21 in the direction specified by the identity 1). The\nsubset \u0393\u2217 (E(\u03a9)) is made of two pyramids whose tips are also 0 and 1 and whose\nedges are on the surface of the cones and intersect the Bloch sphere where the pure\nstates |\u03c8i i are. (This is the four-dimensional version of the n = 3 case represented\nin Figure 3.2.)\nThis set contains the set Ek\u2217 (E(H)) of effects preserved by Ek\u2217 :\nEk\u2217 (E(H)) \u2282 \u0393\u2217 (E(\u03a9)).\nIndeed, the action of the channel Ek\u2217 consists in reducing the radius of the two cones\nrepresenting E(H) by a factor one-third, which creates two smaller cones which are\nprecisely inscribed into the two pyramids defining \u0393\u2217 (E(\u03a9)). This fact follows from\n\n\f116\n\nDecoherence\n\nknowing that the largest sphere inscribed in a regular tetrahedron (which is the\nshape of the base of these four-dimensional pyramids) has radius equal to one-third\nthe distance from the center to any of the vertices.\nHence all the effects preserved by E are also coarse-grainings of \u0393. Since the\noperators \u0393i are linearly independent, \u0393\u2217 is invertible, which implies that any observable made of effects preserved by \u0393 is also preserved by \u0393. Hence, any observable\nwhich is preserved by the channel Ek has its effects in Ek\u2217 (E(H)) \u2282 \u0393\u2217 (E(\u03a9)) and is\ntherefore a coarse-graining of \u0393.\nThis shows that for this example,\nI \u2282 P\u0393\nfor any SIC-POVM \u0393. Note that all the SIC-POVMs are given by applying an\narbitrary unitary transformation to any given one. In this example, the channel E\nis covariant with respect to the whole unitary group. Indeed,\n2\n1\n1\nE(U \u03c1U \u2217 ) = U \u03c1U \u2217 + Tr(\u03c1) U U \u2217 = U E(\u03c1)U \u2217 .\n3\n3\n2\nThis is the reason why any unitary transformation of our pointer-observable \u0393 is\nalso a pointer observable.\n\n5.5.4\n\nExample: iterated interactions\n\nConsider an interaction defined by the isometry V : H \u2192 H \u2297 HE , where HE denotes a subsystem of the environment, and H is finite-dimensional. This interaction\ncan be iterated in a way which adds a new subsystem of the environment at each\niteration. For instance, the third iteration is given by the isometry\nV (3) : H \u2192 H \u2297 HE1 \u2297 HE2 \u2297 HE3\nwhere HE3 ' HE2 ' HE1 \u2261 HE , which is defined by\nV (3) |\u03c8i = ((V \u2297 1E2 )V \u2297 1E1 )V |\u03c8i.\nAn example would be a system colliding with different particles, one after the other.\nThe system HEn corresponds to the nth particle it has interacted with.\nThe channel E describing the evolution of the system during each interaction is\ngiven by\nE \u2217 (A) := V \u2217 (A \u2297 1E )V\nand has for complement\nEc\u2217 (B) := V \u2217 (1 \u2297 B)V.\nThese two channel can be used to describe the channel\nEk : Bt (H) \u2192 Bt (HEk )\n\n\fDecoherence from broadcasting\n\n117\n\nfrom the initial state of the system to the final state of the kth particle of the\nenvironment:\nEk (\u03c1) = Ec (E k\u22121 (\u03c1))\nwhere, by E k\u22121 we mean k \u2212 1 iterations of the channel E. It is clear from the\ndefinition that the observables preserved by E n are also preserved by E m whenever\nm \u2264 n. Therefore, the observables preserved by Em are also preserved by En\nwhenever m \u2264 n. This implies that the observables I preserved by all the channels\nEn , k \u2264 n are also preserved by Ek = Ec \u25e6 E k\u22121 . What is I in the limit k \u2192 \u221e?\nLet us assume that H is finite-dimensional. Then we know[39] that there is an\nincreasing sequence of integers {ki }\u221e\ni=1 \u2286 N which is such that in the limit i \u2192 \u221e,\nki \u2217\n(E ) tends to a projective unital completely positive map P which projects on the\nfixed point set Fix E \u2217 . This shows that the observables preserved by the channels\nE k for all k \u2208 N are those which are fixed by E, i.e. such that\nX = X \u25e6 E.\nNote that this is a case where the preserved observables are entirely characterized\nby the preserved effects.\nAn effect A which is preserved by all the channels E k , k \u2208 N must be such that\nA = P(Ec\u2217 (B))\nfor some effect B. This implies in particular that A \u2208 Fix E \u2217 . But what can we\ndeduce about Ec\u2217 (B)?\nFor simplicity, let us suppose that E is unital, i.e. E(1) = 1. Then we know\n[59], that Fix E \u2217 is a \u2217-algebra, which we will call A. Clearly it is also trivially a\ncorrectable algebra for E. Therefore we know from Corollary 3.8 that all the effects\nin Ec\u2217 (E(HE )) must belong to the commutant A0 :\nEc\u2217 (E(HE )) \u2282 A0 .\nWe have seen in Section 4.3.1 that the center Z(A) is characterized by a complete orthogonal family of subspace Hk , which we will associate with isometries Vk\nand projectors Pk = Vk Vk\u2217 . A generic element A \u2208 A is of the form\nX\nA=\nVk (Ak \u2297 1k )Vk\u2217\nk\n\nwhere Ak \u2297 1k is an operator on Hk . Similarly, an element B \u2208 Ec\u2217 (E(HE )) \u2286 A0 is\nof the form\nX\nB=\nVk (1k \u2297 Bk )Vk\u2217 .\nk\n\nIn addition, since P fixes A, its channel elements Ei must all belong to the\ncommutant A0 [60]. This can be seen by studying its effects on projectors inside\nA, and using Lemma 3.2. This implies that it is of the form\nX\nP(A) =\nVk (1k \u2297 (Eki )\u2217 )Vk\u2217 AVj (1j \u2297 Eji )Vj\u2217\nijk\n\n\f118\n\nDecoherence\n\nHence we can deduce that an effect A preserved by all channels Ek is of the form\nX\nA = P(B) =\nVk (1k \u2297 (Eki )\u2217 )(1k \u2297 Bk )(1k \u2297 Eki )Vk\u2217\nik\n\n=\n\nX\n\nVk (1k \u2297 (Eki )\u2217 Bk Eki )Vk\u2217\n\nik\n\nwhere we assumed that B \u2208 Ec\u2217 (E(HE )) \u2282 A0 . This shows that A \u2208 A0 . But we\nalso know that A \u2208 A since it is in the image of P. Hence A \u2208 A \u2229 A0 = Z(A).\nT\nTherefore, in the case where E is unital, the observables in I = k PEk all belong\nto a commutative algebra: the center of the algebra A = Fix E \u2217 .\n\n5.6\n\nDiscussion\n\nLet us summarize the picture of decoherence suggested by Theorem 5.3. We considered a quantum system undergoing an open evolution, i.e. interacting with its\nenvironment. Nothing forces the information preserved in the system to be classical, unless the evolution is a \"fully decoherent\" channel of the form studied in\nSection 5.4. However, we have seen that the information which is broadcast redundantly to the environment is characterized by a classical set of observables I \u2286 P\u0393 .\nThis process is the physical realization of a measurement of the pointer observable\n\u0393 on the system by the environment. The redundancy guarantees the objectivity\nof the information stored in the environment, as argued in [10]. Furthermore, if\nthis information is also preserved in the system itself during the interaction, then\nthe information contained in the environment is correlated with that contained in\nthe final state of the system (even if it evolved). Therefore this information has\npredictive power and can characterize the state of a deterministic effective classical\nmodel of the system.\nIn this picture, the pointer observable can be defined even if it does not represent\ninformation which is preserved in the system. In this case, the emergent classical\ndegrees of freedom represent a classical system subject to noise. Alternatively, the\nprocess of decoherence in this situation can be seen as a destructive or partially\ndestructive measurement.\nNote that if I = P\u0393 this process represents an exact measurement of \u0393 by\nthe environment, whereas I ( P\u0393 implies that the environment does not gain full\ninformation about \u0393. In this case, \u0393 represents only an approximate description of\nthe information present in the environment. This also means that there exists an\nambiguity in the pointer observable due to the arbitrariness of the extra information\ncontained in P\u0393 .\nFinally, we observed that even if the measurement of \u0393 by the environment is\ncomplete, the corresponding classical limit may have some forbidden states. Indeed, if \u0393 represents an approximate simultaneous measurement of non-commuting\n\n\fDiscussion\n\n119\n\nobservables, the classical states in its image are constrained to respect the corresponding uncertainty relations. However we expect these quantum constraints on\nthe effective classical states to be irrelevant for phase-space observations coarser\nthan ~.\n\n5.6.1\n\nUniversality of classicality\n\nThe main advantage of this picture is that it relies on very little physical assumptions. For instance, no particular model of interaction has been assumed. We\ndid however, make one rather unusual assumption which requires some comments,\nnamely the idea that only redundant information matters at macroscopic scales.\nThis idea seems intuitively reasonable as redundancy of information evokes the\namplification of a signal. In addition, we cannot think of any classical degree of\nfreedom which is not represented redundantly in a way or another, given that large\nsystems are always made of many particles which share the essential properties of\nthe object. As an example, we can think of the position of a rigid body. Certainly,\nknowing the position of any of its molecule would suffice to localize it.\nIn fact, since what it means to be macroscopic has never been defined unambiguously, it is tempting to think of this assumption as a mere definition. Indeed,\nwe could say that macroscopic physics is that which deals with highly redundant\ninformation. In this view, that which is \"macro-\" in \"macroscopic\", i.e. large, is\nthe number of equivalent representations of the same information. If we accept this\npostulate, then Theorem 5.3 shows that macroscopic information is always classical, hence making the universality of classicality at macroscopic scales a tautology.\nA problem with this view is that the our notion of redundancy relies entirely on a\npreferred decomposition of the environment into subsystems. For our interpretation\nto make sense, the decomposition should be such that a classical observer is only\nable to measure observables which are local with respect to this decomposition.\nThis view stands in contrast to the standard approach on this question, which\nconsists in the study of realistic models under a class of assumptions as broad as\npossible, with the aim of showing that they are indeed fully decoherent, in the\nsense that their evolution destroys all but classical information [13]. However such\nstudies have a point: decoherence is omnipresent even in microscopic experiments,\nwhich is why building a quantum computer is so difficult.\nThese two views may be reconciled if we consider that quantum experiments\nare about the control of a microscopic system by a macroscopic one, which is\nby definition subject to decoherence. Macroscopic systems are those which are\nextremely efficient at spreading information. It is therefore no surprise that when\nput in contact with quantum systems, classical instruments cause a decoherence\nwhich may otherwise be absent.\n\n\f120\n\n5.6.2\n\nDecoherence\n\nOutlook: dynamics and constraints\n\nTo conclude, we will say a few words about the possibility of integrating dynamics\ninto our model of decoherence, which is an open question.\nLet us consider the \"broadcasting\" channel E defined by Equation 5.12. As\nalready explained in the beginning of Section 5.6, in order to obtain a dynamical\neffective classical theory, we need to assume that the information represented by\nthe set I is also preserved in the system. We will suppose that the evolution of the\nsystem itself is given by the channel EA . This channel represents only the relation\nbetween two specific moments in time. However, if E and EA are obtained from a\nunitary interaction generated by a Hamiltonian, they naturally depend on the time\nat which we decide to trace out the system or the environment respectively. In\nfact, we need not trace-out both at the same time. For instance, we could use the\nchannel E as it is at asymptotic times, assuming that the environment permanently\nkeeps a record of the relevant information about the system.\nRecall that the channel E to the environment selects a classical model characterized by the set of observables I, or its approximate representation given by the\npointer observable \u0393 which is such that P\u0393 \u2287 I. We suppose that, in addition,\nEA (t) preserves I for all time t. This means that for any observable X \u2208 I, there\nexists a family of observables Y (t) which are such that X = Y (t) \u25e6 EA (t). The\ntime-dependant observable Y (t) represents how the information about the initial\nproperty X evolves in time. A problem is that in general, Y (t) has no reason to belong to the set I or to its idealization P\u0393 . Therefore, the map X 7\u2192 Y (t) cannot be\nunderstood as a \"classical\" transformation within I in any straitforward manner.\nThis indicates that, in order to be able to compare observables at different times\nand identify an effective classical dynamics, some extra assumptions or inputs are\nneeded.\nIn principle, what we expect is that the environment is continuously monitoring\nthe same observables of the system. However it is not easy to see how to model this\nphenomenon in our framework. Indeed, the time-dependant channel E(t) from the\nsystem to the environment only describes the information that the environment at\ntime t contains about the initial state of the system. Of course we could instead\nconsider discrete successive measurement of the system by different parts of the\nenvironment, which should in fact be close the what really happens. However, this\nwould seem to remove one of the advantages of our picture, namely its ability to\ndescribe a continuous decoherence process.\nWe will leave these questions open for further work. For now, let us introduce\nanother possible approach, which consists in considering time as a variable of the\nsystem with no special status.\nThere are two ways of interpreting the phase-space \u03a9 of a classical system. It\ncan be seen as representing the state of the system at a given time, but it can also be\nunderstood as representing all physically allowed histories of that classical system.\nIndeed, for simple unconstrained systems, the elements of \u03a9 are one-to-one with\n\n\fDiscussion\n\n121\n\npossible time histories. If, in addition, the system described by the phase-space \u03a9\ncontains a physical clock, then the external time becomes superfluous and can be\nconsidered as gauge.\nThe same should be true in quantum mechanics. A quantum state |\u03c8i \u2208 H\ncan be understood as describing our general knowledge of the system, without any\nassumption about time. This is particularly apparent in the Heisenberg picture,\nin which time simply labels the possible observations. This point of view yields a\ndifferent light on a classical limit of the form \u0393 : Bt (H) \u2192 L1 (\u03a9), which now maps\nquantum histories to classical histories.\nLet us therefore suppose that we have such a \"timeless\" quantum system described by the Hilbert space H. Since our decoherence framework does not make\nany explicit mention of time, we can still consider an environment B with subsystems B1 , B2 , . . . and a channel\nE : Bt (H) \u2192 Bt (HB1 \u2297 HB2 \u2297 . . . )\nwhich represents how information about H happens to be contained in the environment, and expect \u0393 to emerge as described in Section 5.5.\nIn a sense, the map \u0393 directly takes into account the dynamics. Note however\nthat the classical set of histories \u03a9 may need to be larger than what we really\nexpect. Remember that in our picture the limit ~ \u2192 0 is taken only at a later\nstage, when the constraints on the classical states L1 (\u03a9) imposed by the quantum\nuncertainty relations are ignored. In the case where the limit of whole quantum\nhistories is taken into account, it is likely that the classical limit that we get for\nfinite ~, which is characterized by \u0393, yields mixtures of trajectories which differ\nby powers of ~, and hence explore paths which are not characterized by the ideal\nclassical phase-space.\nThere is another problem with this picture, which is that, for realistic interacting\ntheories, the structure of the set of physical solutions is never fully understood.\nTherefore we do not know the space H to start with. In fact, this is what equations\nof motions, or more generally field equations, are about: they allow one to express\nlocal properties of the physical system without having to understand its global\nbehaviour. Equations of motion are local in time, while full field equations are also\nlocal in space.\nNote also that field equations do not only describe the evolution of the field in\ntime, but may also describe spacial constraints that the field must satisfy. In fact\nwe can view the equations of motions themselves as constraint on possible histories,\nwhich allows to unify the picture.\nThis fact is especially vivid in the case of general relativity, where no physical\nnotion of time exists prior to solving all of the equations which govern the theory.\nIn this sense, if by \"dynamics\" we refer to the process of solving the equations\nof motion, then the dynamics of general relativity has nothing to do with time.\nInstead, one start from the set of all \"kinematical\" histories, defined by all possible\n\n\f122\n\nDecoherence\n\nmetrics (and matter fields) on a fixed spacetime manifold, and then solves Einstein's\nequations in order to obtain the \"physical\" histories. Einstein's equations can\nbe interpreted as specifying a constraint on the kinematical histories. In fact it\nis not difficult to formulate any classical theory in a similar way, given that the\nequations of motions can always be interpreted as specifying some constraint on\ngeneral histories of the usual phase-space variables.\nInstead of giving a classical example, let us directly show that the same can\nbe done in quantum mechanics. We will follow Rovelli [61, 62] and show how the\ndynamics of a non-relativistic quantum particle can be formulated as a constraint,\nimplemented as a projector on a \"kinematical\" extended Hilbert space. Consider a\nsingle, one-dimensional, non-relativistic particle with standard Hamiltonian\nH=\n\npb2\n+ \u03c6(b\nx).\n2m\n\nIn the position representation, the time-evolution of a particle with initial state\n\u03c80 \u2208 H = L2 (R) is given by Schr\u00f6dinger's equation\ni~\n\n\u2202\u03c8t (x)\n~2 \u2202 2 \u03c8t (x)\n=\u2212\n+ \u03c6(x)\u03c8t (x).\n\u2202t\n2m \u2202x2\n\nThis equation can be reinterpreted as an equation on \u03c8 \u2208 HK := L2 (R2 ):\ni~\n\n\u2202\u03c8(x, t)\n~2 \u2202 2 \u03c8(x, t)\n+\n+ \u03c6(x)\u03c8(x, t) = 0.\n\u2202t\n2m \u2202x2\n\nb on L2 (R2 )\nWhat this is saying is that \u03c8 must belong to the kernel of an operator C\nwhich is defined by\n2\nb := E\nb \u2212 pb \u2212 \u03c6(b\nC\nx).\n2m\nb := i~ \u2202 and p\u0302 := i~ \u2202 . Technically, although C\nb has 0 in its spectrum,\nwhere E\n\u2202t\n\u2202x\nits kernel is empty because the solutions to Schr\u00f6dinger's equation cannot be normalized in L2 (R2 ). Indeed, we know that it preserves probabilities in time, which\nmeans that the square of |\u03c8(x, t)| integrated over x is the same at any fixed time\nt, which implies that the integral over t will diverge. There are various ways to\ngo around this problem. Here, let us simply suppose that we are working within a\nfinite interval of time. Therefore, we redefine HK as\nHK = L2 (R \u00d7 [0, T ]).\nThis does not change anything about the properties of Schr\u00f6dinger's equation, but\nit has the advantage of putting all the (time-limited) solutions inside HK . The\nb here is not self-adjoint, however it does have a kernel which is\ndrawback is that C\nb inside HK . There is an\nall we need from it. Let P be the projector on the kernel of C\n\u2217\n\u2217\nisometry V : H \u2192 HK such that V V = 1H , and V V = P . Indeed, we know from\nthe properties of Schr\u00f6dinger's equation that the space of solutions is isomorphic to\n\n\fDiscussion\n\n123\n\nH = L2 (R). The map V \u2217 represents the \"effect\" of solving Schr\u00f6dinger's equation:\nit projects on the space of solutions.\nLet us give an example of a possible classical limit for this dynamical system.\nTo this construction, we add \u03930 , the coherent-state observable on H = L2 (R)\nintroduced in Section 5.1. If \u03930 really defines the classical limit of the theory, we\nmay hope that it indirectly maps the quantum evolution defined by the isometry\nV to an effective classical evolution. Let us write V for the channel defined by\nV , i.e. V(\u03c1) := V \u03c1V \u2217 for a state \u03c1 of H. This channel V can be understood as\nmapping our knowledge of the initial state into a knowledge of the whole history\nof the particle.\nIn order to obtain a proposition for the classical limit of the dynamical system,\nwe first need to make some assumption about the classical limit of time itself.\nNote that we introduced time as a quantum observable which commutes with both\nthe position and momentum operators. Indeed, time is a subsystem of its own\nsince HK = L2 (R) \u2297 L2 ([0, T ]). Let \u0393T be the map which sends a state \u03c1 of\nthe time subsystem L2 ([0, T ]) into the classical time state \u03bc(t) = ht|\u03c1|ti, where\n|ti represents the formal eigenstates of the time operator Tb. Overall we obtain\nan extended classical limit \u0393K := \u03930 \u2297 \u0393T , which operates between quantum and\nclassical histories:\n\u0393K : Bt (HK ) \u2192 L1 (R2 \u00d7 [0, T ])\nIt simply sends a state \u03c1 of HK to the probability distribution\n\u03bc(q, p, t) = (hq, p| \u2297 ht|) \u03c1 (|q, pi \u2297 |ti)\n\n(5.17)\n\nwhere |q, pi are coherent states. This map alone has nothing to do with the dynamics contained in the isometry V. However suppose that the quantum states that we\nuse actually satisfy Schr\u00f6dinger's equation, i.e. \u03c1 = V \u03c10 V \u2217 , where \u03c10 is a state of\nH. The resulting map\n\u0393 := \u0393K \u25e6 V\ndoes not directly give us a distribution over the classical phase-space, but instead\na probability distribution over classical histories:\n\u0393 : Bt (H) \u2192 L1 (R2 \u00d7 [0, T ]).\nNote that, although this map \u0393 is technically a valid abstract classical limit,\nthe resulting classical system is not deterministic in terms of the variable t \u2208 [0, T ].\nThis is due to the fact that this picture assumes a process of decoherence which\ndoes not interfere with the exact quantum evolution of the system. It amounts to\napplying the map \u03930 on the state of an evolving quantum system independently\nat each time, therefore erasing the information which would be required to predict\nthe evolution of an initial state. This shows that this cannot be a realistic model\nof decoherence for this particular system.\n\n\f\fReferences\n[1] C. Beny, A. Kempf, and D. W.
