Transport across domain walls in magnetic semiconductors [1],\noxides [2] and metals [3] has been investigated, including studies of constrictions where spin\nreversal is more abrupt and magnetoresistance can be dramatically increased [4]. As well as\ntheir fundamental importance to an understanding of the physics of magnetoresistive devices\n[5], domain walls are also central to novel logic devices [6] and, through the phenomenon of\nspin transfer torque domain wall motion [7], provide a strong contender for future data\nstorage cells.\nTypical values of the intrinsic domain wall magnetoresistance in ferromagnetic thin\nfilms are only of the order of 0.1-1.0 percent of the normal resistivity, and are readily masked\nby extrinsic effects associated with the magnetic domain structure [8]. This has made it\ndifficult to distinguish between different theoretical models of the resistance which variously\npredict positive domain wall resistance, due to spin mistracking in the domain wall [9],\nnegative, due to the suppression of weak localisation corrections [10], or of either sign,\ndepending on the spin-dependent relaxation times of the charge carriers [11]. By considering\nspin-dependent impurity scattering within the wall, akin to the theory of giant\nmagnetoresistance in magnetic multilayers, Levy and Zhang (LZ) [12] have developed a\ntheory of positive domain wall resistance for current flow both perpendicular to (CPW) and in\nthe plane of (CIW) the wall, which has been used to interpret a number of experimental\nresults in thin ferromagnetic films [13,14,15]. However, problems associated both with the\nelimination of extrinsic effects and in making quantitative estimates of the physical quantities\nthat enter the LZ theory, have made it difficult to claim conclusive agreement.\nHere we report results on a controllable 'artificial domain' system which allow us\nentirely to exclude extrinsic effects, as well as to study precisely the systematic dependence\n\n2\n\n\fof domain wall resistance on the angle between the direction of current and the domain wall.\nComparison with a numerical simulation of our sample structures reveals that the full wall\nresistance is only measured for tilted structures with a sufficiently large domain width to wire\nwidth aspect ratio. Measurements on suitably designed samples permit us, for the first time,\nto map precisely the angular dependence of the domain wall resistivity tensor. These results\nare fully consistent with Levy-Zhang theory, which allows us to make a quantitative estimate\nof the ratio of minority to majority spin carrier resistivities, \u03c1\u2193/\u03c1\u2191, that is in good agreement\nwith thin film band structure calculations.\nOur results are based upon the magnetotransport properties of artificial magnetic\ndomain structures in perpendicularly magnetised Pt/Co/Pt trilayers, which are realised by\nlocally modifying the anisotropy by irradiation with a Ga focused ion beam (Ga-FIB) [16].\nBy depositing thin SiO2 capping layers prior to Ga-FIB irradiation (which is known to cause\nmixing/roughening at the Co/Pt interfaces and a relief of interface strain) we have shown that\nwe can precisely control the coercive fields of the artificial domains [17]. In this way\nmagnetic domain structures can be defined of arbitrary shape with <10nm spatial resolution,\nwhose domain walls lie at precisely controlled angles, as exemplified in Figs. 1a,b. Other\nattractive features of this system include the fact that closure domains, which can be a major\nsource of anisotropic magnetoresistance [18], are not energetically favoured in ultrathin (0.6\nnm) Co films with strong perpendicular anisotropy, whilst the relatively high film resistivity\n(~21 \u03bc\u03a9 cm at 300 K) leads to short scattering times, \u03c4, and \u03c9c\u03c4~10-4<<1 (where \u03c9c is the\ncyclotron frequency), and allow Lorentz magnetoresistance and other effects associated with\nthe wiggling of current lines at domain walls to be completely neglected.\nOur transport devices were fabricated from a Pt(3.5 nm)/Co(0.6 nm)/Pt(1.6 nm)\nsandwich structure, which was deposited on a Si/SiO2 substrate at 300 K using dc magnetron\nsputtering. Optical lithography and reactive ion etching were used to pattern the magnetic\n\n3\n\n\ffilms in a Wheatstone bridge geometry based on 1\u03bcm wide 'active' wires (Fig. 1c). After\ndeposition of an additional 8 nm SiO2 capping layer, the desired domain pattern was\nirradiated with a 30 keV Ga ion dose of 0.009pC/\u03bcm2 in two asymmetric arms of the bridge\n(Fig. 1d) using an FEI Strata 201 Ga-FIB.\n\nTo eliminate any extraordinary Hall effect\n\noriginating from the Pt/Co/Pt underneath the voltage contacts, the Pt capping layer and Co\nlayer were etched away in an Ar plasma after photolithography, and before evaporation of\nTi/Au electrodes. It is possible that a very thin film of Co remained unetched after this step.\nThe magnetic force microscopy (MFM) images shown in Figs. 1a,b demonstrate the precision\nwith which 'striped' artificial domains can be defined. Images a1 and b1 were captured at\n\nH \u22a5 = 50 Oe when the magnetisation of the irradiated regions was reversed with respect to\nunirradiated regions, while a2 and b2 show the same regions after the magnetisation has been\nsaturated everywhere at H \u22a5 = 300 Oe.\n\nThe very weak contrast in these latter images\n\nindicates that Ga-FIB irradiation causes a very small change in the saturation magnetisation\ndue to Co/Pt mixing, the resistivity of these regions also increases very slightly by ~2.5%.\nMeasurements of our bridge devices were performed with a 10\u03bcA ac current (29 Hz) between\ncurrent contacts A and B, and the output voltage measured with a lock-in amplifier between\nV1 and V2. An external magnetic field was applied perpendicular to the plane of the device\nwith a solenoid.\nFig. 2a illustrates a set of magnetoresistance measurements recorded at 300K on\nbridges with stripe domain 'superlattice' structures containing 0, 2, 4 or 8 artificial domains\n(all 500nm wide in CPW geometry). Each measurement has been performed on a different,\nbut otherwise identical, bridge structure fabricated on the same chip. For H > +150 Oe, both\nthe irradiated and unirradiated domains are magnetised in the same direction and the\nresistance is at a low value. If the field is now reversed to H \u2248 -50 Oe, the magnetisation of\nthe irradiated stripe domains, which have a smaller coercive field [17], begin to reverse and\n\n4\n\n\fthe resistance increases to a maximum when domain walls are fully developed between\nirradiated and unirradiated regions. When the field is made more negative still it eventually\nreaches the coercive field of the unirradiated stripes (~100 Oe), which in turn start to reverse\nand the resistance drops back down to a minimum. The same behaviour is observed if the\nfield is now swept back up in a positive sense. The weakly varying background signal is\nprobably due to magnetoresistance arising from residual Co left under the voltage contacts\nafter etching as described above. A separate Hall bar device was patterned in the same\nPt/Co/Pt trilayer structure with Hall 'crosses' containing unirradiated and irradiated (with the\nsame Ga-FIB dose) strips of the same width for extraordinary Hall effect (EHE)\ninvestigations [17]. The coercive fields inferred from these EHE measurements agree well\nwith the values estimated from the magnetoresistance data.\n\nFig. 2b shows that the\n\nmagnetoresistance of such domain structures increases linearly with the number of domain\nwalls. Also included are data for structures with different irradiated domain widths, which\nconfirm that the resistance is independent of the width of artificial domains, exactly as\nexpected for intrinsic domain wall magnetoresistance at the border between the irradiated and\nunirradiated regions.\nHaving established the intrinsic domain wall origin of the magnetoresistance,\nmagnetic domains were patterned at various angles with respect to the current flow in order\nto probe the perpendicular and parallel domain wall resistivities. Multiple artificial magnetic\ndomains were patterned, as described above, with the normal to the wall subtending an angle\n\u03b8 in the range 0\u00b0-60\u00b0 with respect to the current direction. The geometry is shown in the inset\nof Fig. 3b. For all samples the channel width was 1\u03bcm, and the width of the irradiated\nartificial domains were kept invariant at 1\u03bcm. The 16\u03bcm long Pt/Co/Pt wires imposed\ngeometrical constraints on the number of superlattice repeats that could be used. For \u03b8=0\u00b0,\n20\u00b0, and 30\u00b0 six irradiated stripes were patterned, whereas for \u03b8=40\u00b0, 50\u00b0 and 60\u00b0 only three\n\n5\n\n\firradiated stripes were possible. Therefore the magnetoresistance is due to twelve domain\nwalls for the former set of angles, and six for the latter.\n\nFig. 3a illustrates the 300K\n\nmagnetoresistance of our bridge devices with different tilt angles. A steady decrease in the\nmaximum resistance change is observed as the angle, \u03b8, is increased. Also noticeable is a\nsystematic broadening of the resistance peaks at larger angles. Since the domain width is the\nsame in each case this can only arise from changes in the reversal dynamics due to angledependent changes in the magnetostatic interaction at the sharp and blunt corners of tilted\ndomains. This will, for example, lead to a distribution of de-pinning fields for a domain wall\ntrapped at the interface between an irradiated and an unirradiated domain.\nTo understand the angular dependence of the magnetoresistance, we model the current\nflow within the device channel, treating the problem as two-dimensional. In steady state, the\ncontinuity equation requires that divJ=0, and from Maxwell's equations curlE=0, where the\ncurrent density J and electric field E are related via the resistivity tensor E=\u03c1J. On account of\nthe high resistivity of our transport devices we neglect off-diagonal terms of \u03c1 within each\nregion, which is either (i) unirradiated, with \u03c1xx=\u03c1yy=\u03c10 (we take x to be along the device\nchannel), (ii) irradiated, with \u03c1xx=\u03c1yy=\u03c1I, or (iii) a domain wall, for which\n\n\uf8eb cos\u03b8\n\u03c1 DW = \uf8ec\uf8ec\n\uf8ed \u2212 sin \u03b8\n\nsin \u03b8 \uf8f6\uf8eb \u03c1 CPW\n\uf8f7\uf8ec\ncos\u03b8 \uf8f7\uf8f8\uf8ec\uf8ed 0\n\n0 \uf8f6\uf8eb cos\u03b8\n\uf8f7\uf8ec\n\u03c1 CIW \uf8f7\uf8f8\uf8ec\uf8ed sin \u03b8\n\n\u2212 sin \u03b8 \uf8f6\n\uf8f7,\ncos\u03b8 \uf8f7\uf8f8\n\n(1)\n\nwith \u03c1CPW and \u03c1CIW the resistivities for current flow perpendicular and parallel to the domain\nwall respectively [12]. We solve the equations numerically in terms of a stream function, \u03c8,\nwith J=(\u2202\u03c8/\u2202y,-\u2202\u03c8/\u2202x), assuming uniform current J=J0=(J0,0) at each end of the device\nchannel and no current flow through the sides. The equations are discretised on a piecewise\nuniform finite difference grid, and solved iteratively using multi-grid relaxation with\ncontinuity of the normal current and tangential electric field boundary conditions at each\n\n6\n\n\finterface. Iterations are terminated when the residual is less that 10-10, and the potential V\nalong the device channel then calculated from E=-gradV.\nIn Fig. 3b we show typical results for the change in the potential along the device\nchannel created by the presence of domain walls, for different angles of the irradiated region.\nAs well as a sharp increase across the domain wall itself, the potential also displays an\nincrease on both sides, which is due to the formation of static eddy-currents, shown in the\ninset. The size and range of this contribution increases with the angle \u03b8, but our simulations\nconfirm that for the structures investigated here the potential change is fully contained within\nthe device channel and not responsible for the changes in Fig. 3a. To understand the\nlongitudinal channel resistance, we note that the additional resistivity due to the domain wall,\n\u03b4\u03c1CPW=\u03c1CPW\u2212\u03c10, \u03b4\u03c1CIW=\u03c1CIW\u2212\u03c10, is small. Neglecting the difference in the resistivity of the\nirradiated and unirradiated regions (which changes the final result by at most a few percent)\nthe electric field can be written as E=(\u03c10+\u03b4\u03c1)(J0+\u03b4J) so that to first order \u03b4Ex=\u03b4\u03c1xxJ0+\u03c10\u03b4Jx.\nSince \u03b4Jx integrates to zero along the channel, the additional resistance may be attributed to\n\u03b4\u03c1xx and hence reflects the angular variation of the resistivity tensor in Eqn. (1), which in\ngeneral contains both CPW and CIW contributions:\n\n\u03b4\u03c1 DW = \u03b4\u03c1 xx = (\u03b4\u03c1 CPW \u2212 \u03b4\u03c1 CIW ) cos 2 \u03b8 + \u03b4\u03c1 CIW\n\n(2)\n\nIn Fig. 3c we plot the domain wall resistivity, derived from curves of the type shown in Fig.\n3a, against cos2\u03b8. Also plotted are the results of our numerical simulations. Both measured\nand simulated results are accounted for very well by Eq. (2). In order to derive \u03b4\u03c1DW from our\nmeasurements we have taken the domain wall width in our 0.6nm thick Co layer to be 15 nm\n[18], and assume a parallel resistor model for our trilayer films with resistivities uniformly\nscaled from the bulk values to give the correct total resistance.\nUnlike previous attempts to study the anisotropy of domain wall resistivity [2,14],\nwhich used naturally-occurring reasonably well-ordered striped domain structures, these are\n\n7\n\n\fthe first measurements to exploit precise artificial control of domain wall orientation. This\neliminates much of the uncertainty involved in analysis of the observed angular dependence.\nFor example, we do not need to estimate the relative proportion of domain walls aligned\nperpendicular to the current [14]. As expected from Eq. (2) and the theory of Levy and\nZhang, which predicts \u03b4\u03c1CPW > \u03b4\u03c1CIW, we find that the domain wall resistivity remains\npositive for all angles, with values for the perpendicular and parallel domain wall resistivities\nthat may be inferred from our measurements of \u03b4\u03c1CPW = 23.1\u00b11.1\u00d710-3 \u03bc\u03a9-cm and \u03b4\u03c1CIW =\n3.5\u00b10.7\u00d710-3 \u03bc\u03a9-cm respectively. We note that the results in Fig. 3c also limit the magnitude\nof any non-Hall-like contribution to the domain wall resistivity tensor \u2013 which has been\nassumed to be zero in Eq. (1) but which, if present, would make a sin 2\u03b8 contribution \u2013 to\nless than 0.5\u00d710-3 \u03bc\u03a9-cm. The magnetoresistivity ratio MRCPW = \u03b4\u03c1CPW/\u03c10 is 0.1%, which is\ncomparable to values deduced for domain walls in other metallic systems [3]. The ratio of\nCPW to CIW resistivities is \u03b4\u03c1CPW/\u03b4\u03c1CIW \u2248 6.6\u00b11.2; according to LZ theory this is\n3 + 10 \u03c1 \u2193 / \u03c1 \u2191 /( \u03c1 \u2193 / \u03c1 \u2191 + 1) where \u03c1\u2193/\u03c1\u2191 is the ratio of minority to majority spin carrier\nresistivities. The value \u03c1\u2193/\u03c1\u2191~5.5 which we deduce is greater than in bulk Co (\u03c1\u2193/\u03c1\u2191~4) [19],\nbut consistent with the Fermi level density of states ratio that we find in band structure\ncalculations of a Pt/3ML Co/Pt sandwich structure, where an enhancement of the minorityspin density of states arises due to band-narrowing [20].\nThis model system provides exciting opportunities for both studying and exploiting\ndomain wall physics, such as current-induced domain wall motion. Our accomplishments in\ncontrolling the exact domain structure that forms in the nanowire and suppressing extrinsic\neffects are important ones, eliminating difficulties that have plagued the domain wall\nresistance field for many years. These measurements have demonstrated that an unambiguous\nsmooth mapping of the DW resistivity from CPW to CIW can be observed in carefully\ndesigned samples containing tilted domains. A natural development will be to study whether\n8\n\n\fthe magnitude of magnetoresistive effects can be enhanced by fabricating nanoconstrictions\nwithin the nanowire, or whether there are important effects arising from reducing the wire\nwidth/domain width ratio for tilted domains. Multiple-terminal \"mesoscopic\" measurements\nto probe transverse resistance within tilted domains will provide further insight into the\nvalidity of microscopic theories of domain wall scattering. Finally, our room temperature\nmeasurements point to applications in practical devices \u2013 one can envisage, for example,\nusing the domain wall angle as a control parameter in multiple-state logic devices based upon\nspin-torque transfer.\nThis work was supported by the Leverhulme Trust, through grant no.
