The model, which is derived from a rigorous multichannel\nquantum-defect formulation of bimolecular processes, agrees with the classical Langevin model at\nsufficiently high temperatures. It also gives the first analytic description of ion-molecule reactions\nand inelastic processes in the ultracold regime where the quantum nature of the relative motion\nbetween the reactants becomes important.\nPACS numbers: 34.10.+x,03.65.Nk,34.50.Cx,34.50.Lf\n\nThe classical Langevin model for exoergic ion-molecule\nreactions [1, 2] is one of the most fundamental and powerful results in the theory of reactions. It has been shown\nto be applicable to a variety of systems and over a wide\nrange of temperatures [2, 3]. As a model based on the\nlong-range interaction, it can be expected to be more accurate the lower the temperature [4], until one reaches\na regime where quantum effects, more specifically the\nquantum effects associated with the relative motion of\nthe reactants, become important.\nAn experimental study of reactions in this temperature regime, often referred as the ultracold regime, has\nrecently been realized for neutral-neutral reactions in a\nlandmark experiment by the JILA group [5]. While it is\nnot yet realized for charge-neutral systems, the growing\nability of making cold molecular samples [6] and manipulating cold ions [7], implies that it may soon become a\nreality. A sample process, likely among the first investigated, would include the type\nA+ + B2 \u2192 AB + B + ,\n\u2192 A + B2+ ,\n\n\u2192 (AB)+ + B ,\n\n(1a)\n(1b)\n(1c)\n\nwhere all reactions can be expected to be exoergic if the\nionization potential of atom A is considerably greater\nthan that of atom B. They can proceed with substantial rates even in the limit of zero temperature as ionmolecule interactions are generally expected to be barrierless at the short range [8].\nThe theory presented here, to be called the quantum\nLangevin (QL) model for the total rate of exoergic ionmolecule reactions or inelastic processes, gives the first\ntheoretical prediction on where and how the quantum\neffects come into play and how the resulting behavior\ndeviates from the classical Langevin model. It is another\napplication of a new quantum framework for reactions [9]\nthat differs considerably from existing formulations [10],\nand is used here to further illustrate the concepts behind\nthe theory.\nIn a conventional quantum theory of reactions [10], little can be known about a reaction without a detailed\n\nknowledge of the potential energy surface (PES), the accuracy of which is often insufficient for quantitative predications, especially at low temperatures. This has been\ntrue even for ultracold atom-atom and ion-atom interactions, where, to the best of our knowledge, no ab initio\nPES for alkali metal systems has ever been sufficiently\naccurate to predict the scattering length. All potentials\nhad to be modified by incorporating a substantial amount\nof spectroscopic data (see, e.g., Ref. [11]). The same issue becomes much more severe for multidimensional PES\nin reactions, and will remain so for many years to come.\nThis difficulty, coupled with the exponential growth of\nthe Hilbert space beyond two-body [12], has limited the\nconventional approach to a few simple systems such as\nD+H2 , with little hope for more complex systems.\nThe multichannel quantum-defect theory for reactions\n(MQDTR), as outline in Ref. [9], with important motivations and ingredients that come before it [5, 13\u201316],\noffers a different perspective on reactions and inelastic\nprocesses. It comes from a much wider assertion that\nmuch can be known about a quantum system, specifically its behavior around a fragmentation threshold, simply from the types of long-range interactions among its\nconstituents. Whatever not yet known can be characterized by a few energy-insensitive parameters, which can\nbe further determined from a few experimental measurements without any knowledge of the short-range interaction, or even the strength of the long-range interaction.\nThis physical picture, which goes back to the original\nquantum-defect theory for the Coulomb interaction [17],\nhas been well established in recent years for atom-atom\n[18, 19] and ion-atom interactions [20], and to a lesser\ndegree for few-atom [21] and many-atom systems [22].\nIts realization for reactions [9], as is further illustrated\nin this work, frees the theory from being held hostage\nby the details of PES, while ready to take advantage of\nthem when they are available. It also resolves a conceptual disparity in existing theories of reactions. While\nmany classical models [2, 4] are based on the recognition\nof the importance of the long-range interaction, the same\nphysical concept gets lost in the conventional quantum\nformulations [10]. It is primarily due to this omission\n\n\f2\n\nK(T ) = sK K(n) (Ts ) ,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere sK is the rate scale defined earlier, and K(n) (Ts )\nis a universal function of the scaled temperature, Ts =\nT /(sE /kB ), given by\nZ \u221e\n2\n(n)\ndx x1/2 e\u2212x W (n) (Ts x) .\n(3)\nK (Ts ) = \u221a\n\u03c0 0\nHere W (n) (\u01ebs ) is a scaled total rate before thermal averaging.

Other than the exponent n, the most important characteristic of such a potential is its length scale\n\u03b2n = (2\u03bcCn /h\u03042 )1/(n\u22122) , where \u03bc is the reduced mass in\nthe entrance channel. It determines the scale parameters for other relevant physical observables, such as the\nenergy, with a scale of sE = (h\u03042 /2\u03bc)(1/\u03b2n)2 , the temperature, with a scale of sE /kB , and the rate of reactions,\nwith a scale of sK = \u03c0h\u0304\u03b2n /\u03bc [9]. For ion-molecule interactions, n = 4 and C4 = \u03b1q 2 /2, corresponding to\nthe polarization potential, with \u03b1 being the average polarizability of the molecule and q the charge of the ion.\nThe realization of the QL model for this class of systems is made possible by a recent reformulation of the\nquantum-defect theory (QDT) for \u22121/R4 potential [20],\nwhich gives, in particular, analytic results for the quantum transmission probability to be used in this work.\nIn Ref. [9], we have shown that under the Langevin assumption, corresponding to the assumption of no reflection by the inner potential, the total rate of reactions and\ninelastic processes follows a universal behavior uniquely\ndetermined by the exponent n characterizing the type of\nlong-range interaction in the entrance channel. Different\nsystems with the same type of potentials differ from each\nother only in scaling. Specifically, the rate constant for\nthe total rate of reactions and inelastic processes can be\nwritten as\n\n4.0\n\nn=4\n\n3.5\n\n3.0\n\n2.5\n\n2.0\n\n1.5\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n(\u03b5s)1/4\nFIG. 2.

A\ncomparison of this QDT expansion with the exact result\nis shown in Fig. 3.\nAt high temperatures as characterized by Ts \u226b 1, it is\nstraightforward to show, from the semiclassical limit of\nthe transmission probabilities [19], that\nK(4) (Ts ) \u223c 2 ,\n\n(12)\n\nin agreement with the classical Langevin model [1, 2].\nFigure 3 shows that the transition from quantum to semiclassical behavior occurs over a temperature range of\nsE /kB , which we generally refers as the van der Waals\ntemperature scale. The rate goes from 4sK at the threshold to approximately the Langevin rate of 2sK beyond\nsE /kB . Figure 3 also shows that the oscillatory structure\npresent in W (n) has mostly been washed out by thermal\naveraging.\nAll scaled results can be put on absolute scales using a single parameter, the average polarizability of the\nmolecule \u03b1. It determines both the rate scale sK and the\ntemperature scale sE /kB . Sample scale parameters are\ngiven in Table I. They are chosen to illustrate that the\nmeaning of the ultracold regime, if defined as the range\nof temperatures over which the quantum effects are important, is very different for different systems. It covers a\n\n\f4\nmuch broader temperature range for lighter systems than\nfor heavier ones. They are also chosen to imply that we\nexpect the QL model to be applicable not only to nonpolar molecules, but also to small polar molecules such\nas KRb [5], with the main difference being that its upper\nrange of applicability will be more limited [29]. It is interesting to note from the table that despite wide variations\nof temperature scales for different systems, the rate scales\nare of the same order of magnitude, \u223c 10\u22129 cm3 s\u22121 ,\nwhich is roughly 100 times greater than those for neutralneutral reactions [9].\nIn conclusion, we have presented a fully quantal version of the Langevin model for exoergic charge-neutral\nreactions and inelastic processes. It is a universal model\nin which different systems differ only in scaling, further\nillustrating the concept that even in a purely quantum\ntheory, there are important aspects of reactions that can\nbe understood without detailed knowledge of the PES at\nthe short range. Such aspects include not only the total rate of reactions and inelastic processes, presented\nhere, but also the elastic cross section and the total\ncross section, to be presented elsewhere. For a stateto-state partial cross section, it can be shown from the\nunderlying MQDTR [9] that while its absolute value requires the short-range PES, its energy dependence can\nstill be parametrized using the same universal transmisc(n)\nsion probabilities Tl\n(\u01ebs ). We point out that the QL\nmodel is applicable not only to molecules in the ground\nor low-lying states, but also to molecules in vibrationally\nhighly excited states and to atoms in selective Rydberg\nstates (ones with significant quantum defect). In such applications, the theory connects with quantum few-body\nphysics [30], and provides a description of their behavior\noutside of the so-called universal regime, a region that\nhas been difficult to treat using other methods because\nof the large number of open channels. In a mathematical\nabstraction with even broader implications, the QL models presented here and earlier in Ref. [9] represents one\ntype of universal behaviors that can emerge whenever the\nnumber of open channels in a set of coupled channel (or\nclose-coupling) equations becomes large. It is our belief\nthat uncovering and taking advantage of such universal\nbehaviors will be the key to a more systemic understanding of quantum systems beyond two-body.\nThis work was supported by the NSF under the Grant\nNo. PHY-0758042.\n\nbo.gao@utoledo.edu\n[1] P.
