INTRODUCTION\n\nOne of the most striking observations in recent times having a cosmological implication has been that of a periodicity in the\ndistribution of galaxies. This possibility was pointed out by Tifft [1] in 1977 and was subsequently confirmed by the deep pencil\nbeam survey directed at the galactic pole as reported by Broadhurst, Ellis, Koo and Szalay (BEKS) in 1990 [2]. The successive\npeaks of the galaxy distribution has been found to have a periodic separation of about 128h\u22121 Mpc observed over a scale of\n2000h\u22121 Mpc (here h is the present value of the Hubble constant in units of 100 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 ).\nA spatial periodicity of this nature is indeed a bewildering and uncomfortable feature because in the standard cosmological\nmodels a spatial homogeneity (the cosmological principle) is built in. Naturally there have been attempts to account for this\ndiscovery in terms of an illusion introduced by a temporal periodicity in cosmological quantities like the Hubble's parameter H\nor the Newton's constant G, rather than a real spatial inhomogeneity. The first serious attempts towards this came immediately\nfollowing the BEKS results through the work of Morikawa [3,4] and that of Hill, Steinhardt and Turner [5]. Morikawa introduced\na scalar field, having a tiny mass scale of order 10\u221231 eV [4], non\u2013minimally coupled to gravity and showed that the required\nperiodicity could possibly be obtained from this model. This ansatz has its problems. For example, the predicted value of q0 ,\nthe present deceleration parameter, from this ansatz, is positive and could be as high as 60. This squarely contradicts the recent\nobservation of a presently accelerating universe [6]. Hill et al. [5] discussed the possibilities of explaining the BEKS results\nvia different scenarios. An oscillating dark matter field or an oscillating Rydberg \"constant\" were shown to be inconsistent but\nan oscillating G or an oscillating galactic luminosities could potentially solve the problem. Busarello et al. [7] showed that a\nnon\u2013minimally coupled scalar field can indeed produce an oscillation consistent with the BEKS data while a minimally coupled\nscalar field cannot.\nSalgado et al. analysed an oscillating G model, induced by the oscillations of a non\u2013minimally coupled scalar field \u03c6, which also\nhas a scalar potential V (\u03c6) [8]. With a reasonable choice of initial conditions, they carefully fixed the parameters in the model\nand numerically investigated the possible oscillations in G, Hubble parameter H, energy density fractions and other quantities for\nspatially flat and open Friedmann\u2013Robertson\u2013Walker (FRW) models. The parameters were also fine tuned to the requirements\nof primeval nucleosynthesis. They showed in addition [9] that this scalar field can also account for the cosmological dark matter\nand up to 98% of the energy density of the Universe can be stored in the scalar field. In all these investigations the cosmological\nparameters like H or G oscillate at the present epoch. For example, in [8] these parameters are monotonic functions of time\nduring the early stages of cosmic evolution and enters the oscillatory phase only in the later stages.\nIt is worthy of mention that the present rate of variation of G has a stringent upper bound imposed by the Viking radar echo\nexperiment [10]. It was shown by Crittenden and Steinhardt [11] that there is an apparent conflict between these bounds and the\nvalue that is needed for periodicity in the galaxy distribution. In fact they argued that the nucleosynthesis constraints, consistent\n\n\u2217\n\nnarayan@juphys.ernet.in\ndiego@ulises.uab.es\n\u2021\nsomasri@cosmo.fis.fc.ul.pt\n\u2020\n\n1\n\n\fwith these bounds, are very stringent on this oscillating G model unless a \"fine tuning\" of oscillation of the scalar field is\nassumed. In a recent work, Gonz\u00e1lez et al. [12] showed that with this restriction on the upper bound on the variation of G, one\ncannot have sufficient oscillation in order to explain the galactic periodicity as observed by the deep pencil beam survey.\nFurthermore, the luminosity\u2013redshift relation of distant supernovae led to the conclusion that the present universe is accelerating\nits expansion [6] although, in order to facilitate the primeval nucleosynthesis, it must have been decelerating in the radiation era.\nThese results might lead to the possibility that if the observed periodicity in the distribution of galaxies has to be attributed to the\nimprints of some temporal oscillations in some cosmological parameters, these oscillations should have taken place in the early\nstages of the evolution rather than recently.\nKeeping this possibility in mind, we present an exact analytic model of a non\u2013minimally coupled scalar field cosmology in which\nthe oscillatory behaviour takes place in the past, namely during the radiation era. We start from Nordtvedt's generalization of\nBrans Dicke (BD) theory [13] where the dimensionless BD parameter \u03c9 is taken to be a function of the scalar field \u03c6 [14]. We\ndo not employ any additional scalar potential V (\u03c6). The effective self\u2013interaction is taken care of by the functional dependence\nof \u03c9. With the matter distribution taken in the form of radiation, i.e., \u03c1 = 3p, where p and \u03c1 are the pressure and energy density\nof the cosmic fluid, it is found that there exists an exact analytical set of solutions for the field equations where \u03c6, G, and H\nhave an oscillatory phase. One important feature is that these oscillations die out in the radiation dominated period itself with\nG approaching a constant value and H becoming a monotonically decreasing function of time. The functional dependence of\n\u03c9 on \u03c6 may be carefully chosen so as to meet the observational requirements like the gravitational constant G stabilizing at the\npresent value resulting in the transition to general relativity. This avoids the conflict between the bounds on variation of G and\noscillations in G required for galactic periodicity.\nThe gravitational field equations in the generalized scalar tensor theory are too involved. So we adopt the following strategy.\nWe effect a conformal transformation for the metric tensor components which results in a major simplification of the field\nequations [15] as they become more tractable. This transformed version is not \"physical\" in the sense that the geodesic equations\nare not valid in this version (Einstein's frame). For a modern review, see Faraoni et al. [16]). But as we have the complete\nanalytic solutions for the equations, we can transform the metric back to its original version (BD frame). We discuss all the\ncosmologically relevant functions in this physical version, and so the results obtained can be stated with confidence.\nIn section 2 we present the model and obtain the solutions. In section 3 the oscillatory behaviour is studied in detail. Finally,\nsection 4 summarizes our conclusions and suggests directions of further investigation.\n\nII. FIELD EQUATIONS AND FORMULATION OF THE MODEL\n\nWe start from the action\n1\nS\u0304 =\n16\u03c0G0\n\nZ\n\n\u221a\n\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u03c9(\u03c6)\n,\u03b1\n\u2212\u1e21 \u03c6R\u0304 \u2212\n\u03c6,\u03b1 \u03c6 + L\u0304m d4 x ,\n\u03c6\n\n(1)\n\nwhere L\u0304m is the matter lagrangian and G0 the Newtonian gravitational constant. The dimensionless Brans\u2013 Dicke parameter \u03c9\nis now assumed to be a function of the scalar field \u03c6. This generalization of BD theory, proposed by Nordtvedt [14], includes\na host of non\u2013minimally coupled scalar tensor theories, suggested from different physical motivations and they are in fact the\nspecial cases of this ansatz.\nTo simplify the calculations we effect the conformal transformation\ng\u03bc\u03bd = \u03c6\u1e21\u03bc\u03bd ,\n\n(2)\n\nso that the action looks like\n1\nS=\n16\u03c0G0\n\nZ\n\n\u0015\n\u0014\n\u221a\n2\u03c9 + 3\n,\u03b1\n\u2212g R \u2212\n\u03c6,\u03b1 \u03c6 + Lm d4 x .\n\u03c62\n\n(3)\n\nVariables with and without an overhead bar are in the original version and the conformally transformed version respectively. For\nan FRW spacetime the gravitational field equations in the latter version are\n3\n\n\u02272\nk\n2\u03c9 + 3 2\n+ 3 2 = 8\u03c0G0 \u03c1 +\n\u03c8\u0307 ,\na2\na\n4\n\n\u00e4 k + \u02272\n2\u03c9 + 3 2\n2 +\n= \u22128\u03c0G0 p \u2212\n\u03c8\u0307 ,\n2\na\na\n4\n\n(4)\n\n(5)\n\nwhere a is the scale factor, k the curvature index having values 0 or \u00b11 and \u03c8 = ln( \u03c6\u03c60 ), \u03c60 being a constant. The density and\npressure of the cosmological perfect fluid are \u03c1 and p, respectively. The wave equation for the scalar field is given by\n2\n\n\f\u0227\n(2\u03c9 + 3)(\u03c8\u0308 + 3 \u03c8\u0307) = 8\u03c0G0 T \u2212 \u03c9\u0307 \u03c8\u0307.\na\n\n(6)\n\nHere T = \u03c1 \u2212 3p is the trace of the energy momentum tensor of the matter field.\nThe position of the first acoustic peak in the anisotropy power spectrum of the cosmic microwave background radiation strongly\nsuggests that the Universe is spatially flat (see e.g., [17]), thereby we shall assume k = 0. Also we require to investigate the\nbehaviour of the model at an early stage of evolution rather than at the present epoch, so we take the perfect fluid distribution as\nradiation, i.e., an equation of state \u03c1 = 3p. This leads to a straightforward first integral of the wave equation as\n1\n\n(2\u03c9 + 3) 2 a3 \u03c8\u0307 = A1\n\n(7)\n\nA1 being a constant of integration. A combination of equation (4), (5) and (7) yields\n\u00e4 \u02272\nA2\n+ 2 + 6 = 0,\na a\na\n\n(8)\n\nwhere A2 = A21 /12. After integrating once, equation (8) can be written as\nu2 =\n\nA2\nB1\n+ 2,\na4\na\n\n(9)\n\nwhere u(a) = \u0227 and B1 is a constant of integration. This equation can again be integrated and it yields three results, depending\non the signature of B1 . In what follows we shall take B1 = B 2 > 0. In this case the solutions for the scale factor can be written\nin terms of the transcendental function\nh\ni\np\n1\na= \u221a\n2B(t + \u03c4 ) + m2 ln(a + m2 + a2 ) ,\n(10)\nm2 + a 2\nwhere m = A/B and \u03c4 is a constant of integration. From equation (7) and (9) one can easily obtain\n\u0012\n\n2\u03c9 + 3\n12\n\n\u00131/2\n\nd\u03c8\nm\n,\n= \u221a\nda\na m2 + a 2\n\n(11)\n\n\u00bfFrom this equation \u03c8 (or \u03c6 = e\u03c8 ) can be expressed as a function of a, if a definite functional form of \u03c9 = \u03c9(\u03c6) is chosen. In\nwhat follows, we take\n2\u03c9 + 3 =\n\n3\n\u03c62\n,\n4C (1 \u2212 \u03c6)[C(\u03c6 \u2212 1) + 1]\n\n(12)\n\nwhere C is a constant.\nIt deserves mention that Quevedo et al. [18] have shown that in order to account for the nonbaryonic dark matter as a non\u2013\nminimally coupled scalar field, the effective \u03c9 parameter should be a ratio of quadratics in \u03c6. The action integral (1) suggests\nthat the gravitational coupling G is given as\nG=\n\nG0\n.\n\u03c6\n\n(13)\n\nIt is well\u2013known that \u03c9 \u2192 \u221e is a necessary (although not sufficient [19]) requirement for the scalar tensor theories becoming\nindistinguishable from general relativity, where G = G0 . Our choice of \u03c9 indicates that for \u03c6 \u2192 1, \u03c9 goes to the desired infinity\nlimit and G \u2192 G0 (see Eq. (12)). Using the expression for \u03c9 in equation (12) and the relation \u03c8 = ln(\u03c6/\u03c60 ), equation (11) can\nbe integrated to yield\n\u0015\n\u0014\na\n1\n\u221a\n,\n(14)\n\u03c6 = 1 \u2212 sin2 2 C ln\nC\nm + m2 + a 2\nwhere a constant of integration is put equal to nought. It is clear from equation (14) that \u03c6 is not a monotonic function of the\nscale factor, but rather has an oscillation. But in order to understand the behaviour of the model, one has to find the expression\nof the scale factor in the original version of the theory, i.e., \u0101 as given in equation (1), in place of a, because only in that\nversion the theory retains the principle of equivalence and quantities carry their usual physical significance. Although we have\nan analytic form for a, but it is expressed in a transcendental way (equation (10)) and so we shall endeavour to investigate the\nactual behaviour of different relevant quantities by graphical representation.\n3\n\n\fIII. OSCILLATORY BEHAVIOUR OF \u03c6, G AND H\n\nIt is easy to recast the expression for the scalar field \u03c6 in equation (14) in terms of the original scale factor \u0101 with the help of\nequation (2) as\n##\n\"\n\"\n\u221a\n\u0101\n1\n\u03c6\np\n,\n(15)\n\u03c6 = 1 \u2212 sin2 2 C ln\nC\n1 + 1 + \u03c6\u01012\n\nwhere we have chosen B to be 12 and m to be 1 for the sake of computational simplicity. The expression for the effective\ngravitational constant G(= \u03c61 ), if the present value (G0 ) is taken to be unity, is given as\nG=\n\n1\n=\n\u03c6\n\n1\u2212\n\n1\nC\n\n1\n\u0014\n\u0014\nsin2 2 C ln\n\n1+\n\n\u221a\n\u0101 \u03c6\n\u221a\n\n1+\u03c6\u01012\n\n\u0015\u0015 .\n\n(16)\n\nThe Hubble parameter H\u0304 in this frame is given by,\np\n\u0227 1 \u03c6\u0307\n\u0101 \u0307\nd\n= [ln(a \u03c6)] = \u2212\n\u0101\ndt\na 2\u03c6\n\"\n#\np\n1\nsin\n2X\n=\n1 + \u03c6\u01012 +\n,\n3\n1 \u2212 C1 sin2 X\n2\u03c6 2 \u01013\n\nH\u0304 =\n\nwhere X = 2 C ln\n\n1+\n\n\u221a\n\u0101 \u03c6\n\u221a\n\n1+\u03c6\u01012\n\n(17)\n\n. Now the scalar field \u03c6, the Newtonian constant G and the Hubble parameter H\u0304 are all, in princi-\n\nple, known in terms of scale factor \u0101. But as these relations are involved and it is hardly possible to investigate the nature right\nfrom these expressions, we plot these quantities \u03c6, G and H\u0304 against \u0101.\nBefore we actually plot these variables, the one arbitrary constant in equation (11), namely C, should be evaluated. As we\nare interested in the behaviour of the model in the early stages of the evolution, i.e., when the scale factor has small values, it\nwould be useful to have a series expansion of equation (10). Along with the choice B = 12 and m = 1, equation (10) can be\napproximated to\na=\n\n\u00023\n\n2 (t\n\n\u00031/3\n,\n+ \u03c4)\n\n(18)\n\nwhere the series is retained up to third order in a. Now with the help of this expression, the time evolution of the scalar field can\nbe expressed as follows\n\u0014\n\u0015\n1\nt\n2 2C\n\u03c6 = 1 \u2212 sin\nln(1 + ) .\n(19)\nC\n3\n\u03c4\nSimilarly from equations (17), (18) and (19) the time variation for the Hubble parameter H\u0304 is\n\u0013\u0015\n\u0014\n\u0012\n1\n1\n2C\nH\u0304 =\nt\n.\n1\n+\nsin\n2\n2t 2\n3\u03c4\n3\u03c4 (1 + \u03c4t )\n1 \u2212 ( 3\u03c4\n)\nClearly the part within the square bracket produces an oscillatory behaviour in H\u0304.

From figure 2 one can find that\nG also has an initial oscillation and then quickly settles down to a value close to its present value (G0 is taken to be unity in\nthe units in which the equations are written). H\u0304 too has an oscillation (see figure 3), about a steadily decreasing mean value\nand then becomes a monotonically decreasing function of \u0101. This is a desirable feature as in the radiation paradigm we need a\ndecelerating universe (q > 0). Figure 4 shows that \u03a9\u03c6 , the dimensionless density parameter corresponding to the scalar field,\nalso has an initial oscillation, and then approaches the value zero in the early radiation era.

CONCLUDING REMARKS\n\nIn order to have a compromise between the periodicity in the galaxy distribution and the cosmological principle, one might\nrequire a temporal periodicity in the cosmological model resulting in an apparent spatial periodicity. An oscillating G model is\nindeed one of the most viable options in this connection.\nWe have resorted to Nordtvedt's scalar tensor theory to build a model in which \u03c6, G and H present oscillations but confined\nto the radiation\u2013dominated era of cosmic expansion. Owing to the fact that the dark\u2013matter component does not interact with\nthe radiation field it clusters with the periodicity of the oscillations. Later on, during the matter era the baryonic component is\nfree to fall in the potential wells created by the dark component. Our solutions are analytical, but a bit involved -Eqs. (15)\u2013(17).\nThis is why we have depicted their behaviour with expansion. Aside from being compatible with primordial nucleosynthesis\n6\n\n\fbounds our model has the advantage that the BD parameter diverges for large \u0101, therefore no conflict with local measurements\nof \u03c9 arises [10]. So one really has wider options to account for the periodicity of the galaxy distributions as an imprint of a\ntemporal oscillation in G and H.\nObviously, since the oscillations do not extend to the matter era the model presented in this paper cannot account for the\nalleged periodicity in length of the solar year, supposedly derived from periodic structures found in coral fossils and marine bivalves [21]. However, it should be noted that such periodicity may well be purely biological in origin and therefore unconnected\nto alleged oscillations of the solar year.\nIt also deserves mention that the functional dependence of \u03c9 on \u03c6 taken up in this work -Eq. (12)- is by no means unique.\nThere could well be possibilities of \u03c9 = \u03c9(\u03c6) other than the one adopted here. This indeed gives a flexibility for improvisation\nif required to fit in other observations such as the late time acceleration of the Universe.\nIn fact it will be worthwhile to figure out the correct \u03c9 = \u03c9(\u03c6) which serves all these purpose, namely drives an oscillation\nat some stage, gives perfect ambience for nucleosynthesis, and generates sufficient negative pressure in the later stage so that an\naccelerated expansion for the present universe could be explained.\nFrom the figures it can be seen that our model does not produce enough number of oscillations, i.e., more rings of galaxies\nare observed than oscillations our model is able to provide. This is why our model cannot be viewed as fully accounting for\nthe inhomogeneous distribution of galaxies. We believe, however, it may serve as a starting point for more detailed models that\novercome this limitation. A lesser difficulty refers to the fact that our universe seems to be accelerating its expansion today (see\ne.g. [22] and references therein) while our predicts deceleration at the present time. However, this may be solved by introducing\nsome quintessence scalar field such that its contribution to the total energy density becomes relevant only recently [23]. We have\nchosen not to go into that at this stage in order to focus on the problem of galaxy distribution.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nThanks are due to Fernando Atrio for discussions and comments on a earlier draft of this work as well as to Daniel Sudarsky\nand Marcelo Salgado for correspondence.
