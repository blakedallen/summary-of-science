The problem of determining all monohedral tilers, also called the problem\nof tessellation, was brought anew into mathematical prominence by Hilbert when he posed it\nas one of his \"Mathematische Probleme\", see Kershner [4]. It is well-known that all triangles\nand all quadrangles are tilers. Reinhardt [8] determined all hexagonal tilers, and obtained\nsome special kinds of pentagonal tilers. Later it is shown that any polygon with at least 7\nedges is not a tiler by using Euler's formula, see Dress and Huson [3]. The problem of plane\ntiling, however, is now still open to the best of our knowledge. In fact, there are 14 classes\nof pentagonal tilers were found, see Hirschhorn and Hunt [7], Sugimoto and Ogawa [9], and\nWells [10]. For a whole theory of tessellation patterns, see Gr\u00fcnbaum and Shephard's book [6]\nas a survey up to 1987.\nConsidering a variant of the problem of plane tiling, Akiyama [1] found all convex polyhedra whose every development tiles the plane. He call them tile-makers. The main idea\nin his proof is to investigate the polyhedra whose facets tile the plane by stamping. Notice\nthat facets are special cross-sections. This motivates us to consider a more general class of\npolyhedron tilers.\nLet P be a convex polyhedron, and \u03c0 a plane. Denote by C(\u03c0) the intersection of \u03c0\nand P. We say that \u03c0 intersects P trivially if C(\u03c0) is empty, or a point, or a line segment.\nOtherwise we say \u03c0 intersects P non-trivially. In this case, C(\u03c0) is a polygon with at least 3\nedges. We call C(\u03c0) a cross-section if \u03c0 crosses P nontrivially. We say that P is a universal\ntiler if every cross-section of P tiles the plane. In this paper, we study the shape of universal\ntilers. It is a variant of the problem of plane tiling.\n\n1\n\n\fIt is easy to see that every tetrahedron is a universal tiler since every cross-section of a\ntetrahedron is either a triangle or a quadrangle. The main goal of this paper is to present\nthat any universal tiler has at most 5 facets.\nThis paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we derive a necessary condition that a\nhexagonal cross-section (if exists) of a universal tiler satisfies. It will be used for excluding\nthe membership of many polyhedra from the class of universal tilers. In Section 3, we prove\nthat any facet of a universal tiler is either a triangle or a quadrangle. In Section 4, by using\nEuler's formula we obtain that any universal tiler has at most 5 facets.\n\n2\n\nHexagonal cross-sections of universal tilers\n\nNote that no polygonal tiler has more than 6 edges. It follows that any cross-section of\na universal tiler has at most 6 edges. In particular, any facet of a universal tiler has no\nmore than 6 edges. In this section, we shall obtain a necessary condition for hexagonal\ncross-sections of a universal tiler.\nLet P be a polyhedron, and let \u03c0 be a plane which crosses P nontrivially. Let l be a\nline belonging to \u03c0 and let \u03b5 > 0. Denote by \u03c0+ (resp. \u03c0\u2212 ) the plane obtained by rotating \u03c0\naround l by the angle \u03b5 (resp. \u2212\u03b5). Set \u03b5 \u2192 0. It is clear that either \u03c0+ or \u03c0\u2212 crosses P\nnontrivially. Of course it is possible that both \u03c0+ and \u03c0\u2212 crosses P non-trivially. Write\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f2\u03c0+ , if \u03c0+ crosses P nontrivially;\np(\u03c0; l; \u03b5) =\n\uf8f3\u03c0 , otherwise.\n\u2212\nThen p(\u03c0; l; \u03b5) is a plane crossing P nontrivially. Intuitively, for small \u03b5, the plane p(\u03c0; l; \u03b5)\nis obtained by rotating the plane \u03c0 a little along l. For notational simplification, we rewrite\nC(\u03c0; l; \u03b5) = C( p(\u03c0; l; \u03b5) ).\nBy the continuity of a polyhedron, we see that the cross-section C(\u03c0; l; \u03b5\u2032 ) is nontrivial for\nany 0 < \u03b5\u2032 < \u03b5. Let C be a cross-section of P. We say that C is proper if none of its vertices\nis a vertex of P, that is, any vertex of a proper cross-section lies in the interior of an edge\nof P.\nLemma 2.1 If P has a cross-section with n vertices, then P has a proper cross-section with\nat least n vertices.\nProof. Set up an xyz-coordinate system. For any real number a, denote by \u03c0 a the plane\ndetermined by the equation z = a. Suppose that the cross-section C(\u03c0 0 ) has n vertices. Without loss of generality, we can suppose that the half-space z > 0 has non-empty intersection\nwith P. By the continuity of P, there exists \u03b4 > 0 such that for any 0 < \u03b5 < \u03b4, the crosssection C(\u03c0 \u03b5 ) has at least n vertices. Consider the z-coordinates of all vertices of P. Let \u03b7\nbe the minimum positive z-coordinate among. Then the cross-section C(\u03c0 \u03b7/2 ) is a proper\ncross-section with at least n vertices. This completes the proof.\n2\n\n\fAs will be seen, with aid of the above lemma we may take improper cross-sections out\nof our consideration. Let C(\u03c0) = V1 V2 * * * Vn be a proper cross-section of P. It is clear that\nfor any 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n, there is a unique edge of P which contains Vi , denoted ei .\nLemma 2.2 Let C(\u03c0) = V1 V2 * * * Vn be a proper cross-section with Vi \u2208 ei . Then there exists\n\u03b4 > 0 such that for any 0 < \u03b5 < \u03b4,\n(i) C(\u03c0; V1 V3 ; \u03b5) is a proper cross-section with exactly n vertices which belong to the edges\ne1 , e2 , . . ., en respectively;\n(ii) if C(\u03c0; V1 V3 ; \u03b5) = U1\u03b5 U2\u03b5 * * * Un\u03b5 , where Ui\u03b5 \u2208 ei , U1\u03b5 = V1 , and U3\u03b5 = V3 , then\n6\n\nV1 U2\u03b5 V3 6= 6 V1 V2 V3 .\n\nProof. Since C(\u03c0) is proper, by continuity, there exists \u03b41 > 0 such that Condition (i) holds\nfor any 0 < \u03b5 < \u03b41 . Suppose that\nC(\u03c0; V1 V3 ; \u03b5) = V1 U2\u03b5 V3 U4\u03b5 U5\u03b5 * * * Un\u03b5 ,\nwhere Ui\u03b5 \u2208 ei . Let T be the trace of the point U2\u03b5 as \u03b5 varies such that\n6\n\nV1 U2\u03b5 V3 = 6 V1 V2 V3 .\n\n(2.1)\n\nThen T is a sphere if 6 V1 V2 V3 = \u03c0/2, while T is an ellipsoid otherwise. On the other hand,\nthe point U2\u03b5 moves along e2 by Condition (i). So U2\u03b5 belongs to the intersection of a sphere\n(or ellipsoid) and a line. Such an intersection contains at most two points, say \u03b51 and \u03b52 .\nTaking \u03b4 < min{\u03b41 , \u03b51 , \u03b52 }, we complete the proof.\nWe need Reinhardt's theorem [8] of the classification of hexagonal tilers. Traditionally,\nwe use the concatenation of two points, say, AB, to denote both the line segment connecting A\nand B, and its length.\nTheorem 2.3 (Reinhardt) Let V1 V2 * * * V6 be a hexagonal tiler. Then one of the following\nthree properties holds:\n(i) V1 + V2 + V3 = 2\u03c0 and V3 V4 = V6 V1 ;\n(ii) V1 + V2 + V4 = 2\u03c0, V2 V3 = V4 V5 and V3 V4 = V6 V1 ;\n(iii) V1 = V3 = V5 = 2\u03c0/3, V2 V3 = V3 V4 , V4 V5 = V5 V6 and V6 V1 = V1 V2 .\nFigure 1 illustrates the 3 classes of hexagonal tilers.

The 3 classes of hexagonal tilers.\nDenote by HP the set of proper hexagonal cross-sections of P.\nTheorem 2.4 Any proper hexagonal cross-section of a universal tiler, if exists, has a pair\nof opposite edges of the same length.\nProof. Let P be a universal tiler with HP 6= \u2205. For any C \u2208 HP , denote by a(C) the number\nof angles of size 2\u03c0/3 in C. Let\nS = {H \u2208 HP : any pair of opposite edges of H has distinct lengths}.\nSuppose to the contrary that S 6= \u2205. Let H = V1 V2 * * * V6 \u2208 S such that\na(H) = min{a(C) : C \u2208 S}.\nBy Theorem 2.3, we have a(H) \u2265 3.\nWithout loss of generality, we can suppose that\n6\n\nV1 V2 V3 =\n\n2\u03c0\n.\n3\n\n(2.2)\n\nBy Lemma 2.2, there exists \u03b4 > 0 such that for any 0 < \u03b5 < \u03b4,\nC(H; V1 V3 ; \u03b5) = U1\u03b5 U2\u03b5 U3\u03b5 U4\u03b5 U5\u03b5 U6\u03b5 \u2208 HP ,\nwhere U1\u03b5 = V1 , U3\u03b5 = V3 , Ui\u03b5 \u2208 ei and\n6\n\nV1 U2\u03b5 V3 6=\n\n2\u03c0\n.\n3\n\n(2.3)\n\nOn the other hand, by continuity, there exists 0 < \u03b7 < \u03b4 such that for any i mod 6,\n1\nVi Vi+1 \u2212 Vi+3 Vi+4 ,\n2\n1\n2\u03c0\n2\u03c0\n\u03b7\n\u03b7\n6 Vi Vi+1 Vi+2 \u2212\n\u2265\n.\nUi\u03b7 Ui+1\nUi+2\n\u2212\n3\n2\n3\n\n\u03b7\n\u03b7\n\u03b7\nUi\u03b7 Ui+1\n\u2212 Ui+3\nUi+4\n\u2265\n\n(2.4)\n\n6\n\n(2.5)\n\nWrite H \u03b7 = C(H; V1 V3 ; \u03b7). Then H \u03b7 \u2208 S by (2.4). In view of (2.2), (2.3) and (2.5), we\ndeduce that a(H \u03b7 ) \u2264 a(H) \u2212 1, contradicting to the choice of H. This completes the proof.\nAs will be seen, we shall obtain that any universal tiler has no hexagonal cross-sections.\nBut we need Theorem 2.4 to derive this result.\n4\n\n\f3\n\nThe valence-sets of universal tilers\n\nIn this section, we show that any facet of a universal tiler is either a triangle or a quadrangle. Let F = V1 V2 * * * Vn be a facet of P. Let di be the valence of Vi . We say that the\nmultiset {d1 , d2 , . . . , dn } is the valence-set of F . For example, the valence-set of any facet of\na tetrahedron is {3, 3, 3}.\nLemma 3.1 Let P be a universal tiler. Let {d1 , d2 , . . . , dn } beP\na valence-set of a facet of P.\nn\nThen for any 1 \u2264 h \u2264 n, there is a cross-section of P with\ni=1 di \u2212 dh \u2212 2n + 4 edges.\nConsequently, we have\nn\nX\ndi \u2212 dh \u2264 2n + 2.\n(3.1)\ni=1\n\nProof. Let F = V1 V2 * * * Vn be a facet of P, where Vi has valence di . It suffices to show for\nthe case h = 1. We shall prove by construction.\nFor convenience, we set up an xyz-coordinate system as follows. First, choose a point U1\nfrom the interior of the edge Vn V1 . Set U1 to be the origin. Next, choose U2 from the interior\nof V1 V2 , and build the x-axis by putting U2 on the positive x-axis. Then, build the y-axis such\nthat F lies on the xy-plane and the y-coordinate of V1 is negative. Consequently, all the other\nvertices V2 , . . . , Vn have positive y-coordinates. Since F is a facet, the convex polyhedron P\nmust lie entirely in one of the two half-spaces divided by the xy-plane. Build the z-axis such\nthat all points in P have nonnegative z-coordinates. Now we have an xyz-coordinate system.\nLet S = {F \u2032 | F \u2032 is a facet of P, F \u2032 \u2229 F 6= \u2205, F \u2032 6= F } with |S| = s. It is easy to see\nthat\ns=\n\nn\nX\n\ndi \u2212 2n.\n\n(3.2)\n\ni=1\n\nBy continuity, there exists \u03b4 > 0 such that for any 0 < \u03b5 < \u03b4, the cross-section C(z = \u03b5)\nhas exactly s vertices. Here, as usual, the equation z = \u03b5 represents the plane parallel to the\nxy-plane with distance \u03b5. Write\nC(z = \u03b5) = C1\u03b5 C2\u03b5 * * * Cs\u03b5 .\nThen for any vertex Cj\u03b5 , there is a unique vertex Vi such that Vi and Cj\u03b5 lie in the same edge\nof P. Denote this Vi by Rj\u03b5 . Clearly Rj\u03b5 is independent of \u03b5. So we can omit the superscript \u03b5\nand simply write Rj . Without loss of generality, we can suppose that\nR1 = R2 = * * * = R t = V1 ,\n\nR t+1 = V2 ,\n\nRs = V n ,\n\nwhere\nt = d1 \u2212 2.\n\n(3.3)\n\nLet t + 1 \u2264 k \u2264 s, and let yk\u03b5 be the y-coordinate of Ck\u03b5 . Since V2 , . . . , Vn have positive\ny-coordinates, there exists 0 < z0 < \u03b4 such that yk\u03b5 > 0 for any 0 < \u03b5 \u2264 z0 . For simplifying\nnotation, we rewrite\nC(z = z0 ) = C1 C2 * * * Cs .\n5\n\n\fLet yk be the y-coordinate of Ck . Set\n\u03b50 =\n\nn\nz0\nz0\nz0 o\n1\nmin z0 ,\n,\n, ...,\n.\n2\nyt+1 yt+2\nys\n\n(3.4)\n\nP\nWe shall show that the cross-section C(\u03c00 ) has ni=2 di \u2212 2n + 4 edges. Consider the\nfunction f defined by\nf (V ) = \u03b50 y \u2212 z,\nwhere V = (x, y, z) is a point. Denote by \u03c00 the plane determined by the equation f (V ) = 0.\nOn one hand, we have f (Rk ) > 0 since the vertex Rk has positive y-coordinate and zero\nz-coordinate. On the other hand, by (3.4) we have\nf (Ck ) = \u03b50 yk \u2212 z0 \u2264\n\n1 z0\n*\n* yk \u2212 z0 < 0.\n2 yk\n\nTherefore, the points Rk and Ck lie on distinct sides of \u03c00 . Consequently, the plane \u03c00\nintersects the line segment Ck Rk . Let Ik be the intersecting point. Recall that U1 is the\norigin and U2 lies on the positive x-axis. So these two points belong to the plane \u03c00 . Hence\nC(\u03c00 ) = U1 U2 It+1 It+2 * * * Is .\nBy (3.2) and (3.3), the number of edges of C(\u03c00 ) is\ns\u2212t+2=\n\nn\nX\n\ndi \u2212 2n \u2212 (d1 \u2212 2) + 2 =\n\nn\nX\n\ndi \u2212 2n + 4.\n\ni=2\n\ni=1\n\nSince any cross-section of a universal tiler has at most 6 edges, the inequality (3.1) follows\nimmediately. This completes the proof.\nLemma 3.2 The valence-set of any facet of a universal tiler is not {3, 3, 3, 3, 3}.\nProof. Let P be a universal tiler. Suppose to the contrary that P has a pentagonal facet F\nwhose every vertex has valence 3. For convenience, write F = U1\u2032 U2 U3 U4 U5 . Pick a point U1\nfrom the interior of the line segment U1\u2032 U2 such that\nU1 U2 6= U4 U5 .\n\n(3.5)\n\nPick a point U6 from the interior of the line segment U5 U1\u2032 such that\nU2 U3 6= U5 U6\n\nand U3 U4 6= U6 U1 .\n\n(3.6)\n\nThe existences of U1 and U6 are clear. Since the valence of each vertex of F is 3, there exists \u03b4\nsuch that for any 0 < \u03b5 < \u03b4,\nC(F ; U6 U1 ; \u03b5) = U1\u03b5 U2\u03b5 U3\u03b5 U4\u03b5 U5\u03b5 U6\u03b5 \u2208 HP ,\nwhere U1\u03b5 = U1 , U6\u03b5 = U6 , and Ui\u03b5 and Ui lie on the same edge of P for each 2 \u2264 i \u2264 5. On\nthe other hand, by continuity, there exists 0 < \u03b7 < \u03b4 such that for any i mod 6,\n1\nUi Ui+1 \u2212 Ui+3 Ui+4 .\n(3.7)\n2\nIn light of (3.5), (3.6) and (3.7), we see that the cross-section C(F ; U1 U6 ; \u03b7) has no pair of\nopposite edges of the same length, contradicting to Theorem 2.4. This completes the proof.\n\u03b7\n\u03b7\n\u03b7\nUi\u03b7 Ui+1\n\u2212 Ui+3\nUi+4\n\u2265\n\n6\n\n\fUsing similar combinatorial arguments as in the above proof, we can determine the shape\nof a facet of a universal tiler.\nTheorem 3.3 Let P be a universal tiler. Then every facet of P is either a triangle or a\nquadrangle. Moreover, the valence-set of any triangular facet (if exists) of P is either {4, 3, 3}\nor {3, 3, 3}, while the valence-set of any quadrilateral facet (if exists) of P is {3, 3, 3, 3}.\nProof. Let Fn = V1 V2 * * * Vn be a facet of P. Let Sn = {d1 , d2 , . . . , dn } be the valence-set\nof Fn . By Lemma 3.1, we see that for any 1 \u2264 h \u2264 n,\n2n + 2 \u2265\n\nn\nX\n\ndi \u2212 dh \u2265 3(n \u2212 1).\n\ni=1\n\nNamely n \u2264 5. If n = 5, then (3.1) reads\n5\nX\n\ndi \u2212 dh \u2264 12.\n\ni=1\n\nSince each di \u2265 3, we deduce that all di = 3, contradicting to Lemma 3.2. Hence n \u2264 4.\nIf n = 4, then the valence-set S4 is either {3, 3, 3, 3} or {4, 3, 3, 3} by (3.1). Assume\nthat S4 = {4, 3, 3, 3}, where V1 has valence 4. Pick a point A from the interior of the line\nsegment V1 V2 such that V1 A 6= V3 V4 , and a point B from the interior of V2 V3 such that\nAB 6= V4 V1 . Similar to the proof of Lemma 3.2, we can deduce that there exists \u03b7 such that\nthe cross-section C(F4 ; AB; \u03b7) belongs to HP , and it has no pair of opposite edges of the\nsame length, contradicting to Theorem 2.4. Hence S4 = {3, 3, 3, 3}.\nConsider the case n = 3. By Lemma 3.1, the valence-set S3 has five possibilities:\n{3, 3, 3},\n\n{4, 3, 3},\n\n{4, 4, 3},\n\n{4, 4, 4},\n\n{5, 3, 3}.\n\nIf S3 = {4, 4, 3} or S3 = {4, 4, 4}, we can suppose that both V1 and V2 have valence 4.\nPick a point A from the interior of V1 V2 , and B from V2 V3 such that AB 6= V3 V1 . Again,\nthere exists \u03b7 such that C(F3 ; AB; \u03b7) has no pair of opposite edges of the same length,\ncontradicting to Theorem 2.4. If S3 = {5, 3, 3}, we can suppose that V1 has valence 5. Pick A\nfrom the interior of V1 V2 such that V1 A 6= V3 V1 , and B from V2 V3 . By similar arguments, we\nget a contradiction to Theorem 2.4. Hence the valence-set S3 is either {3, 3, 3} or {4, 3, 3}.\nThis completes the proof.\n\n4\n\nThe shapes of universal tilers\n\nIn this section, we show that every universal tiler at at most 5 facets.\nLet P be a universal tiler. Let f (resp. v, e) be the total number of facets (resp. vertices,\nedges) of P. Euler's formula reads\nf + v = e + 2.\n(4.1)\n7\n\n\fIt is well-known that there are two distinct topological types of pentahedra. One is the\nquadrilateral-based pyramids, which has the parameters\n(v, e, f ) = (5, 8, 5);\nthe other is pentahedra composed of two triangular bases and three quadrilateral sides, which\nhas\n(v, e, f ) = (6, 9, 5).\nLet fi be the number of facets of i edges in P. Let vi be the number of vertices of\nvalence i in P. By Theorem 3.3, we have\nf = f3 + f4\n\nand v = v3 + v4 .\n\n(4.2)\n\nHere is the main result of this paper.\nTheorem 4.1 A convex polyhedron is a universal tiler only if it is a tetrahedron or a pentahedron.\nProof. Let P be a universal tiler. By Theorem 3.3, every facet of P has at most 4 edges and\nevery vertex of P has valence at most 4.\nFirst, we deduce some relations by double-counting. Counting the pairs (e\u2032 , f \u2032 ) where f \u2032\nis a facet of P and e\u2032 is an edge of f \u2032 , we find that\n3f3 + 4f4 = 2e.\n\n(4.3)\n\nCounting the pairs (v \u2032 , e\u2032 ) where e\u2032 is an edge of P and v \u2032 is a vertex of e\u2032 , we obtain\n3v3 + 4v4 = 2e.\n\n(4.4)\n\nCombining the relations from (4.1) to (4.4), we deduce that\n(3f3 + 4f4 ) + (3v3 + 4v4 ) = 4e = 4(v + f \u2212 2) = 4(v3 + v4 + f3 + f4 \u2212 2),\nnamely\nf3 + v3 = 8.\n\n(4.5)\n\nOn the other hand, taking the difference of (4.3) and (4.4) yields\n4(f4 \u2212 v4 ) = 3(v3 \u2212 f3 ).\n\n(4.6)\n\nNow we count the pairs (v \u2032 , T ), where T is a triangular facet of P and v \u2032 is a vertex of T\nhaving valence 4. By Theorem 3.3, every triangular facet has at most one vertex of valence 4,\nand every facet containing a vertex of valence 4 must be a triangle. Therefore\n4v4 \u2264 f3 .\n\n(4.7)\n\nBy (4.5), (4.6) and (4.7), we deduce that f3 \u2264 4. Note that f3 is an even number by (4.3).\nSo f3 \u2208 {0, 2, 4}.\n8\n\n\fIf f3 = 4, then v3 = 4 by (4.5), and f4 = v4 \u2264 1 by (4.6) and (4.7). In this case, P is a\ntetrahedron if f4 = 0, and P is a quadrilateral-based pyramid if f4 = 1.\nIf f3 = 2, then v3 = 6 by (4.5), v4 = 0 by (4.7), and consequently f4 = 3 by (4.6). In\nthis case, P is a pentahedron composed of two triangular bases and three quadrilateral sides.\nIf f3 = 0, then v3 = 8, v4 = 0, and f4 = 6. Thus P is a cube. We shall show that it is\nimpossible. Denote\nP = ABCD-EF GH.\nFor convenience, we set up an xyz-coordinate system such that the plane z = 0 coincides with\nthe plane ACH, and the vertex D has negative z-coordinate. Let zB (resp. zE , zF , zG ) be\nthe z-coordinate of B (resp. E, F , G). Since P is convex, all these z-coordinates are positive.\nWrite\n1\n\u03b4 = min{zB , zE , zF , zG }.\n2\nThen the line segment AB intersects the plane z = \u03b5. Let A\u03b51 be the intersecting point.\nSimilarly, let A\u03b52 (resp. C1\u03b5 , C2\u03b5 , H1\u03b5 , H2\u03b5 ) be the intersection of the plane z = \u03b5 and the line\nsegment AE (resp. BC, CG, GH, HE). So\nC(z = \u03b5) = A\u03b52 A\u03b51 C1\u03b5 C2\u03b5 H1\u03b5 H2\u03b5 \u2208 HP .\nH\n\nH1\u03b5\n\nG\n\nH2\u03b5\nE\n\nF\nC2\u03b5\nD\n\nC1\u03b5\n\nA\u03b52\nA\n\nA\u03b51\n\nC\n\nB\n\nFigure 2. The hexagonal cross-section C(z = \u03b5) = A\u03b52 A\u03b51 C1\u03b5 C2\u03b5 H1\u03b5 H2\u03b5 .\nBy continuity, we have\nA\u03b51 A\u03b52 \u2192 0,\n\nC1\u03b5 C2\u03b5 \u2192 0,\n\nH1\u03b5 H2\u03b5 \u2192 0,\n\nas \u03b5 \u2192 0. So there is 0 < \u03b7 < \u03b4 such that the cross-section C(z = \u03b7) has no pair of opposite\nedges of the same length, contradicting to Theorem 2.4. This completes the proof.\nRecall that any tetrahedron T is a universal tiler. We present that pentahedron universal\ntilers also exist.\nTheorem 4.2 Any pentahedron having a pair of parallel facets is a universal tiler.\n9\n\n\fProof. Suppose that P is a pentahedron with a pair of parallel facets. Note that any crosssection of a pentahedron has at most 5 edges. It suffices to show that any pentagonal\ncross-section of P tiles the plane. Let C be a pentagonal cross-section of P. Then C has\na pair of parallel edges. As pointed out by Reinhardt in [8], any pentagon with a pair of\nparallel edges is a tiler. This completes the proof.\n\nReferences\n[1] J. Akiyama, Tile-makers and semi-tile-makers, Amer. Math.
