The partition function and the entropy of the system are computed for lowamplitude initial conditions. Detailed predictions for the long-time solution are derived. Localized\nhigh-amplitude excitations absorb a surplus of energy when they emerge as a by-product of the\nproduction of entropy in the small fluctuations. The thermodynamic interpretation of this process\napplies to many dynamical systems with two conserved quantities.\nPACS numbers: 63.20.Pw,64.60.Cn,45.05.+x,42.65.Jx,\nPhysical Review E 69 (1 Jan. 2004, in press)\n\nLocalization of energy within a small number of isolated high-amplitude structures is a widespread phenomenon in nonlinear optics [1, 2, 3], plasma physics [4],\nBose-Einstein condensates [5] and nonlinear lattice dynamics [6, 7, 8, 10]. Peaks of the energy density result\neither from a collapsing wave train that leads to a finitetime blow-up of the amplitude [4, 11], or, in spatially\ndiscrete systems, from a sequence of merging breathers\n[8].\nIt is the purpose of this article is to show that the formation of peaks is driven by the production of entropy\nand that this behavior is generic for the thermalization\nof many conservative systems where a second quantity\nis conserved in addition to the Hamiltonian. The discrete nonlinear Schr\u00f6dinger equation is a simple generic\nequation that describes discrete breathers in nonlinear\noptical waveguide arrays [2, 3] and dilute Bose-Einsteincondensates that are trapped in periodic potentials [5].\nThe spatial discreteness avoids the leakage of energy\nto infinitesimal scales that can occur during the wavecollapse of continuous systems [9] so that this system is\na simple but representative model for localization processes. The non-compactness of the phase space leads to\na merely technical difficulty in the statistical treatment\nof high-amplitude structures.\nFig.1a shows the focusing process for the focusing discrete nonlinear Schr\u00f6dinger equation (DNLS)\ni\u03c6\u0307n = \u03c6n+1 + \u03c6n\u22121 + |\u03c6n |2 \u03c6n\n\n(1)\n\nAny coefficients of this equation can be removed by scaling, and consequently all quantities are dimensionless.\nFirstly, breathers with moderate amplitudes appear periodically in space and time following a phase instability\nof a regular low-amplitude initial solution. Subsequently,\nthey merge into more persistent peaks with higher amplitudes (lattice site 188 in Fig.1a). The system finally\nsettles into a state where immobile high-amplitude peaks\n(the ring with |\u03c6| \u2248 2.3 in Fig.1b) emerge from a lowamplitude disordered background (core with |\u03c6| < 0.5).\nThe peaks divide the system into patches of the order\n\nof 100 lattice sites where the amplitude is low and the\ndynamics is irregular. The peaks oscillate corresponding\nto their amplitude-dependent frequency and their amplitudes fluctuate slightly, but their position in the lattice\nalmost never changes.\nThis behavior depends crucially\non the system's energy\nP\nE =< H >, where H = i (\u03c6i \u03c6\u2217i+1 + \u03c6\u2217i \u03c6i+1 ) + 21 \u03c62i \u03c6\u2217i 2\n\u2202H\nPersisis the Hamiltonian of the DNLS i\u03c6\u0307n = \u2202\u03c6\n\u2217 .\nn\ntent localization of energy occurs only if the system's\nenergy is positive. In this case the peaks finally absorb\nalmost the total energy (Fig.2a). The height of the peaks\n|\u03c6| \u2248 2...2.5 is almost independent of the total energy\n(Fig.2b), but the number of peaks increases with the\nenergy. For negative energies, there is no localization\nof energy (Fig.1c) and the system settles into a state of\nlow-amplitude fluctuations (Fig.1d,Fig.2a). The system's\nsecond conserved quantity, the modulus-square\n(or\nP norm\n'particle number') A =< A > with A =\n\u03c6i \u03c6\u2217i is also\ncrucial for this phenomenon. There is no persistent localization of energy in this system if the rotational symmetry linked to this second conserved quantity is broken.\nThe discrete nonlinear Schr\u00f6dinger equation admits energies \u22122A \u2264 E \u2264 2A for low-amplitude initial conditions A/N \u226a 1. As suggested by Fig.1b, the phase space\nmay be separated into a low-amplitude domain \u2206< for\n|\u03c6< | < r and a high-amplitude domain \u2206> for |\u03c6> | \u2265 r.\nTo avoid formal difficulties with diverging terms, a preliminary upper bound R > r of the phase space is introduced as |\u03c6| \u2264 R. The main contributions to the\nenergy arise from interactions in the low-amplitude domain (where N \u2212K oscillators are gathered and nonlinear\ncontributions are negligible) and from the quartic contribution of K \u226a N \u2212 K oscillators in the high-amplitude\ndomain. The Hamiltonian is therefore approximated as\nH \u2248 H\nP< + H>\n=\nu(r \u2212 |\u03c6i |)u(|r \u2212 |\u03c6i+1 |)(\u03c6i \u03c6\u2217i+1 + \u03c6\u2217i \u03c6i+1 )\n1\n+ 2 u(|\u03c6i | \u2212 r)\u03c62i \u03c6\u2217i 2\n(2)\nwith the unit step function u(x < 0) = 0, u(x \u2265 0) = 1.\n\n\f2\nThe second integral of motion may be separated in a\nsimilar way as A = A< + A> . The system's entropy as\na function of the conserved quantities E and A can be\ncomputed from the grand partition function y(\u03b2, \u03b3) =\nR QN\n\u03c1 i=1 d\u03c6i d\u03c6\u2217i using the density \u03c1 = e\u2212\u03b2(H\u2212\u03b3A) .

This neglects the coupling\nterm of the peaks which is small compared to the quartic energy. However, peaks and fluctuations are coupled\nthermally, so that they can exchange energy and particles. This exchange vanishes on average when peaks and\nfluctuations have the same temperature \u03b2 \u22121 and chemical potential \u03b3.

Introducing the variables\nxn = \u03bb1 \u03c6\u2032n \u2212 \u03bb2 \u03c6\u2032n+1 , the partition function of the fluctuations is reduced to Gaussian integrals\nZ\nY\n2\ndxn )2\n(6)\ny< (\u03b2, \u03b3) = ( e\u2212xn det(\u2202\u03c6\u2032n /\u2202xn )\n\u2212K\n\u2212K\nUsing det(\u2202xn /\u2202\u03c6\u2032n ) = \u03bbN\n\u00b1 \u03bbN\n, the Jacobian is\n1\n2\n\u2212(N \u2212K)\n\u2032\ndet(\u2202\u03c6n /\u2202xn ) \u2248 \u03bb1\nfor N \u2212 K \u226b 1 since \u03bb1 > \u03bb2 .\nThe square in equation (6) is obtained from the identical\nintegration over \u03c6\u2032\u2032 .

The ridge E< = 0\ncorresponds to a fluctuating state with an infinite temperature where all wavenumbers have the same power.\nA wave with k = \u03c0/2 is a non-thermalized solution with\nE = 0. This line \u03b2 = 0 was first computed in [7] where\nthe additional nonlinear correction were included, and it\nwas identified as the transition line to the localization\nphase. No analytic results for the statistics beyond this\nline have been available yet.\nEquation (9) gives a valid expression for the total entropy if the system's total energy is negative (corresponding to the right slope with E< < 0 of Fig.3a).\nThe temperature is positive inPthis case, and conse4\nquently the density \u03c1> \u223c e\u2212\u03b2 |\u03c6n | /2 decays rapidly\nfor huge amplitudes so that the high-amplitude contribution to the partition function is negligible. In this phase\nonly small fluctuations contribute to the total entropy\nS = N ln\u03a9. This describes the low-amplitude fluctuating\nstate (E = E< , A = A< ) with no peaks of Fig.1d.\nThe slope E< > 0 is linked to negative temperatures\n[7]. The density \u03c1> increases with the amplitude in this\nregime which was suggested to be the reason for the formation of high-amplitude structures [7]. The increase\nof the density causes obvious technical difficulties: The\nphase space is (unlike in the spin system of [8, 10]) noncompact, so that the integral y> will diverge for any fixed\nnegative values of \u03b2. However, the artificial upper boundary R of the phase space prevents this divergence. The\npartition function can first be computed as a function of\nthis parameter R, which subsequently will be allowed to\ngo to infinity as this maximizes the entropy. From this\nthe contributions of the peaks to the entropy, the energy\nand the particle number can be computed.\nThe grand partition function of the peaks increases as\n4\n2\ny> (\u03b2, \u03b3) \u223c (e\u2212\u03b2(R /2\u2212\u03b3R ) /(\u2212\u03b2R2 + \u03b2\u03b3))K with the cut\u221a\noff R of the phase space if R is greater than \u03b3.

The small fluctuations provide the leading term N ln\u03a9 of the entropy\nwhile the contribution Kln\u0393 (Fig.3b) from the peaks is\nnegligible under the constraint R2 > \u03b3 or 2E> /A> >\n2\n(4A2< + E<\n)/(2E< A< ). y> and \u0393 can be computed in\nthe same way for various types of nonlinearities. The\nentropy increases with A< and decreases with |E< | and\nhas its maximum at E< = 0, A< = A, E> = E, A> = 0.\nThe state of maximum entropy is related to low amplitude fluctuations with \u03b2 = 0 and \u03b2\u03b3 = \u2212N/A.\nThe crucial point is, that the high peaks contribute little\n\n\f4\n\nE<\n\nt=0\nA not conserved\n\n500\n\nA conserved\n\nt=200000\n2\n\nR =\u03b3\nS3\n\n0\n\n0\n\n100\n\n200\n\nS2\n\nS1\n\n300\n\nA<\n\nFIG. 4: Isentropes S1 > S2 > S3 > ... for the left slope\nof Fig.3a; trace (E< , A< ) of the integration of Fig.1a,b over\nE< , A< ; trace for a version of the DNLS where the second\nconservation law is violated.\n\nto the total entropy, while they can absorb high amounts\nof energy using only few particles. On the other side, the\nfluctuations can reach a state with a maximum entropy,\nif they contain the ideal amount of energy. This shows\nthe thermodynamical nature of energy-localization: In\norder to maximize the system's total entropy, the ideal\namount of energy E< must be allocated to the fluctuations. Starting from an initial condition with a positive\nenergy E = E< at the left slope in Fig.3a, the entropy\ncan be increased when E< decreases while the released\nenergy is stored in the localized structures. The state of\nmaximum entropy corresponds to only one peak which\nabsorbs the total energy (Fig.2a) while consuming very\nfew particles. This also shows the self-consistency of the\ntruncation (2) that neglects the interaction of the peaks\nwith their environment. The equilibrium state with localized structures corresponds to \u03b2 = 0, so the temperature\nis not negative. In the opposite case with negative total\nenergies E and a positive temperature, there is no energy\nsurplus and consequently no localization (Fig.1c,d).\nFig.4 gives a numerical picture of the shift of energy\nand particles into the peaks for equation (1) and the\ncorresponding picture for a version of the DNLS where\nthe rotational symmetry is broken by a small term\n0.015Re(\u03c6n). It shows the evolution of the fluctuations\nenergy E< and particle number A< versus the corresponding equilibrium isentropes S = const for a homogeneous low-amplitude (|\u03c6| = 0.3) initial state E< = E =\n2A and A< = A. The boundary between \u2206< and \u2206> is\nr = 1. The particle-nonconserving system produces no\npersistent peaks. Instead, it increases its entropy by increasing the total number of particles and ends up in\na fluctuating high-amplitude state [13]. The particleconserving system (1) approaches the entropy-maximum\nby generating peaks and transferring energy from the\n\nfluctuations E< to E> . On the other side, growing peaks\nalso absorb particles that must be shifted from A< to\nA> . The trace (E< , A< ) therefore strives down to the\nleft in Fig.4. This loss of particles in the fluctuations is\nunfavorable for the production of entropy. The merging\nof peaks however allows the system to store more energy\nin the peaks while feeding particles from the peaks back\ninto the fluctuations A< which leads to an additional increase of the entropy.\nA state with only one huge peak is not reached experimentally (Fig.1b). Instead, a number of coherent structures of moderate height (Fig.2b) survive even on very\nlong time scales (107 time steps in numerical simulations). In Fig.4, the trace (E< , A< ) does not reach the\nstate of maximum entropy at (E< = 0, A< \u2248 370), but\nends up at in a state with only half that particle content, and still a positive amount of energy. The coherent\nstructures contain a significant amount of particles, and\nthe entropy of the fluctuations is below its maximum.\nThe reason for this is the eventual breakdown of the two\nentropy-enhancing mechanisms: Firstly, the merging of\npeaks becomes impossible because peaks above a certain\ncritical height are immobilized by a lattice-pinning effect. For that reason the trace (E< , A< ) in Fig.4 does\nnot cross the isentropes S3 , S2 , S1 . Secondly, the growth\nof peaks stops when this leads to no further increase of\nthe fluctuations entropy. This happens when the entropy\ngain due to the energy transfer to the peaks is matched\nby the entropy loss due to the particle transfer. For this\nreason, the trace (E< , A< ) in Fig.4 does not approach\nthe line E< = 0 any further after \u223c 105 time steps.\u221a\nThe mobility of a peak with an amplitude |\u03c6n | = a at\na site n depends on the compatibility of the local conservation of its energy E = a2 /2 and its particle number\nA = a during a possible migration to the site n + 1. Most\nof the a particles are gathered at these two lattice sites\nduring the migration. The trajectory of such a migration is therefore close to the intersection of the level set\nof E and A with the constraint of nonvanishing amplitudes at \u221an \u221a\nand n + 1 only. These paths\n\u221a are given by\n\u03c6n (\u03bd) = \u221aa 1 \u2212 \u03bdei\u03c8 and \u03c6n+1 (\u03bd) = a\u03bdei\u03b1(\u03bd) ei\u03c8 with\ncos \u03b1 = a \u03bd \u2212 \u03bd 2 /2. The parameter \u03bd goes from 0 to 1\nduring the migration as the particles are shifted from n to\nn + 1. \u03c8 is a phase factor. The bottleneck of this process\nis the intermediate storage of |\u03c6|4 -energy in the coupling\nterm 2Re(\u03c6n \u03c6\u2217n+1 ): The solvability condition cos \u03b1 \u2264 1\nfor all \u03bd requires that a \u2264 4, so that this migrational\npath only exists for peaks below a maximum amplitude\n|\u03c6n (\u03bd = 0)| \u2264 2. For higher peaks, it is impossible to\nconserve both particle number and energy at the instant\nwhen |\u03c6n | = |\u03c6n+1 |. These idealized migrational paths\ndeviate from exact solutions of the DNLS which necessarily have nonvanishing amplitudes for adjacent oscillators\nat n \u2212 1, n + 2, etc. Monte-Carlo simulations of paths\nthat include small amplitudes for adjacent oscillators (420 lattice sites) show that migrations for slightly higher\n\n\f5\npeaks (|\u03c6n (\u03bd = 0)| < 2.28, Fig.2b) are permitted by the\nconservation laws. Higher peaks first need to decrease by\ntransferring particles to remote lattice sites before they\ncan move. This defocusing process would require a very\nunlikely decrease of entropy and the local conservation\nof particles and energy is therefore statistically favorable. Spontaneous collapses of peaks are only possible\nif this increases the total entropy, which is the case if the\nfluctuations have small wavelengths and a positive temperature.\nFurther growth of the peaks requires a flow both of\nparticles and of energy from the fluctuations to the\npeaks as the number of pinned peaks is fixed on relevant time scales. This is thermodynamically favorable only if the increase of the entropy due to the energy transfer is bigger than the decrease caused by the\nparticle transfer. This process stops when the trace\n(E< , A< ) in Fig.4 approaches an isentrope tangentially as\n\u2202E> /\u2202A> |K=const = \u2202E< /\u2202A< |S=const which is equivalent to \u03b3 = R2 . On this line, growth or decay processes of peaks absorb or release energy and particles in\na ratio that amounts to isentropic changes of the fluctuations. The statistical results reflect microscopic dynamical findings [12] of the growth and decay processes\nof localized structures perturbed by one or two incoming\nwaves. Long waves lead to growth, short waves to decay of a peak while the radiated harmonics increase the\nsystems entropy. Experimentally, one still finds irregular\noscillations of the peak heights, but no average growth.\nInteractions of peaks and fluctuations that increase the\npeaks are matched on average by those interactions that\ndecrease the peaks. Waves with all wavenumbers coexist\nin the state of equilibrium where growth processes are\nbalanced by decay processes. Any changes of the peak\namplitude are statistically unfavorable as they decrease\nthe total entropy.\nTo conclude, localization in non-integrable systems constrained by two integrals of motion is a statistical process.\nThe entropy is dominated by contributions from smallamplitude fluctuations. The entropy is maximal if an\noptimal share of each conserved quantity is allocated to\nthe fluctuations. There is no localization if not enough\nenergy is supplied by the initial conditions. If a surplus of\nenergy is provided by the initial conditions, it is dumped\ninto high-amplitude structures that absorb high amounts\nof energy (Fig.2) while using few particles. This explains\nthe phase where energy-localization occurs. The lattice\npinning effect related to the conservation laws prevents\nthe system from reaching the absolute entropy maximum.\nFor the final peak size, growth- and decay-interactions of\nthe peaks with the fluctuations are balanced.\nObviously, the statistical analysis shows the macroscopic\nproperties of an ensemble of microstates, and one might\nexpect that the Arnold diffusion process transfers the trajectory from any initial condition to this most probable\nstate. However, the thermalization may have extremely\n\nlong transients. In the numerical simulations, the amplitudes in the initial conditions were small enough so that\nthe separation of the partition function in the statistical\ndescription was valid, but large enough for the nonintegrability to have an impact on moderate time scales.\nIn the 'integrable' limit of smooth initial conditions with\nvery low amplitudes, the dynamics is most similar to the\ncontinuous onedimensional nonlinear Schr\u00f6dinger equation, which is integrable. Consequently, this part of the\nphase space is partitioned by Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser\ntori that are not destroyed by the nonintegrability and\nthe dynamics is quasiperiodic on very long time scales.\nTo escape from this state, the amplitude has to reach a\nsufficient height so that the nonlinearity absorbs a substantial amount of energy, which becomes a rare event for\nsmall average amplitudes. Such quantities that are almost conserved on moderate time scales can also be relevant for localization effects in systems where the Hamiltonian is the only exactly conserved quantity. For instance,\nthe DNLS with broken rotational symmetry shows energy localization on shorter time scales where the particle\nnumber changes very little. This is the case in the early\nstadium of the path E< , A< where A is not conserved\nin Fig.4. It is an interesting question if this also applies\nto other breather systems where the Hamiltonian is the\nonly conserved quantity [6, 14].\nThe mechanism of localization is found in very diverse dynamical systems as it relies only on the properties of the\nentropy functional and on the existence of two conserved\nquantities and not on the spatial discreteness. Depending\non the type of the nonlinearity, the localized structures\nmay absorb primarily the second conserved quantity [8]\nand not the energy. In continuous systems described by\npartial differential equations [9, 11], the transport of fluctuations is continued down to the molecular scale. Again,\nthe the conservation laws require the formation of localized structures for this exploitation of degrees of freedom\non short space scales.\n\n[1] P.L.Kelley, Phys.Rev.Lett. 15, 1005 (1965),\nE.Garmire, R.Y.Chiao, C.H.Townes, Phys.Rev.Lett.16,\n347 (1966)\n[2] A.B.Aceves, C.DeAngelis, T.Peschel, R.Muschall,\nF.Lederer, S.Trillo, S.Wabnitz, Phys.Rev.E 53. 1172\n(1996)\n[3] H.S.Eisenberg, Y.Silberberg, R.Morandotti, A.R.Boyd,\nJ.S.Aitchison Phys.Rev.Lett.81,3383 (1998)\n[4] V.E.Zakharov, Zh.Eksp.Teor.Fiz. 62, 1745 (1972)\n(Sov.Phys.JETP 35, 908 (1972))\n[5] A.Trombettoni, A.Smerzi, Phys.Rev.Lett.86, 2353 (2001)\n[6] M.Johansson, A.M.Morgante, S.Aubry, G.Kopidakis,\nEur.Phys.J.B 29,279 (2002)\nA.M.Morgante, M.Johansson, G.Kopidakis, S.Aubry,\nPhysica D 162, 53 (2002)\n[7] K.O.Rasmussen,T.Cretegny,\nP.G.Kevrekidis,\n\n\f6\nN.Gronbech-Jensen, Phys.Rev.Lett.84, 3740 (2000)\n[8] B.Rumpf, A.C.Newell, Phys.Rev.Lett. 87, 054102 (2001)\n[9] S.Dyachenko, A.C.Newell, A.Pushkarev, V.E.Zakharov,\nPhysica D, 96 (1992)\n[10] B.Rumpf, A.C.Newell, Physica D 184, 162 (2003)\n[11] V.E.Zakharov,\nV.V.Sobolev,\nV.C.Synakh,\nZh.Eksp.Teor.Fiz. 60, 136 (1971) (Sov.Phys.JETP\n\n33, 77 (1971))\n[12] M.Johansson, S.Aubry, Phys.Rev.E 61, 5864 (2000)\nM.Johansson Phys.Rev.E 63 037601 (2001)\n[13] J.A.Krumhansl, J.R.Schrieffer, Phys.Rev.B 11, 3535\n(1975)\n[14] T.Dauxois, M.Peyrard, Phys.Rev.Lett. 70, 3935 (1993)\n\n\f"}
