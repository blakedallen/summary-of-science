Understanding the growth of nanoscale entities on\nvarious substrates depends, at least in part, on knowing the atomic structure of the substrate. As\nthe low-index crystal surfaces are well understood, the high-index orientations are now progressively\ngaining importance as their richer morphological features may lead to more advanced technological\napplications. To date, there are numerous stable high-index orientations reported in the literature;\nin the case of Silicon and Germanium, these stable orientations have been summarized in Ref. [1].\nThe unstable high-index orientations are important in their own right, as they often give rise to\nremarkable periodic grooved morphologies which may be used for the growth of surface nanowires.\nThe wonderful morphological and structural diversity of high-index surfaces can be appreciated, for\ninstance, from the work of Baski, Erwin and Whitman, who investigated systematically the surface\norientations between Si(001) and Si(111) [2].\nAn interesting case of unstable surface is Si(337), whose atomic structure is the subject of the\npresent article. As a historical account, we note that the Si(337) orientation was concluded to\nbe stable in early studies by Ranke and Xing [3], Gardeniers et al. [4], and Hu et al. [5]. This\nconclusion about the stability of Si(337) was consistent with the reports of Baski and Whitman, who\nshowed that Si(112) decomposes into quasi-periodic Si(337) and Si(111) nanofacets [6], and that\nSi(337) is a low-energy orientation [7]. However, further studies by Baski and Whitman revealed\nthat Si(337) itself facets into Si(5 5 12) and Si(111) [8], demonstrating that Si(337) was, in fact,\nunstable. Since Si(337) is not stable and Si(5 5 12) is [9, 10], the clean Si(112) orientation should\nfacet into Si(5 5 12) and Si(111). However, as explained in Ref. [8], nanofacets are too narrow\n2\n\n\fto form complete Si(5 5 12) units, and mostly settle for the nearby Si(337) orientation. A more\nrecent report [11] shows another situation where Si(337) arises rather than the expected Si(5 5\n12). For a Si(113) surface that is miscut towards [111], the large (5 5 12) reconstruction has not\nalways been found. Instead, a Si(337) phase has been seen to coexist with Si(113) terraces [11].\nThe high resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM) images in Ref. [11] leave no doubt\nthat the periodicity of those nanofacets corresponds to the (337) orientation. The reason for the\nquasi-stability of Si(337) reported in earlier works [3, 4, 5] could be the curvature or the size of\nsubstrates used in those investigations; this explanation is also consistent with Ref. [11], where the\nissue of sample curvature is acknowledged.\nWith one exception [5], atomic-scale models for Si(337) were not sought separately, but rather as\nstructural parts of the Si(5 5 12)-(2 \u00d7 1) reconstruction [9, 12, 13, 14]. As shown in Ref. [9], the Si(5\n5 12) unit cell consists of two Si(337) units and one Si(225) unit. The first model reconstruction\nproposed for Si(5 5 12) [9] appeared somewhat corrugated when viewed along the [110] direction;\nso did a second model by Ranke and Xing [12]. On the other hand, HRTEM measurements [13]\nshowed a flatter profile for Si(5 5 12), and different model reconstructions were proposed [13, 14]\nin order to account for the observed flatness. Total-energy density functional calculations for the\nenergy of Si(5 5 12) have only recently been published, and suggest that the latest models [13, 14]\nhave lower energies than the earlier proposals [9, 12].\nThe reason structural studies of high-index surfaces can be very lengthy originates from the way\nmodel reconstructions are proposed, which is based on physical intuition in interpreting scanning\ntunneling microscope (STM) images. As seen above for the case of Si(5 5 12), the intuitive ways\nare not very robust for high-index surfaces, since usually more models are required when further\nexperiments are reported. Given the rather large number of low-energy structures that high-index\nsurfaces can have (see, e.g., the case of Si(105)[15, 16]), heuristic approaches pose the risk of\n\n3\n\n\fmissing the actual physical reconstruction when considering model candidates for comparison with\nthe experimental data. To alleviate this risk, we have recently addressed the reconstruction of\nsemiconductor surfaces as a problem of stochastic optimization [16], and developed two different\nglobal search algorithms for the purpose of determining the most favorable surface structure [16, 17].\nWe have used these global search procedures for studying Si(105) [16, 17] and Si(114) [18], which\nare both stable orientations for silicon. Although Si(337) is not a stable orientation, its atomic\nstructure can still be pursued with global search algorithms because the only input required is the\nsurface periodicity, which is available from STM [9] and LEED [5] measurements.\nIn this article we report the results of such a global optimization for the structure and energy\nof Si(337) using empirical potential and density functional theory calculations. As we shall see,\nthe optimization retrieves most of the previously proposed models [5, 9, 13, 14], as well as a\nnumber of other reconstructions that could be relevant for experimental situations where Si(337)\nnanofacet arises -other than the two (337) unit cells that appear as part of the (5 5 12) structure.\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In the next section we briefly describe the\ncomputational methods used in this study. In Section 3, we present our model structures for the\nSi(337) surface classified by the number of atoms in the computational cell and their surface energy.\nIn Section 4, we compare our results with other reported Si(337) reconstructions. Our conclusions\nare summarized in the last section.\n\n2\n\nMethods and Computational details\n\n\u221a\nThe Si(337) simulation cell consists of two (337) bulk truncated unit cells of dimensions a 8.375 \u00d7\n\u221a\n\u221a\na 0.5\u00d7a 67, (a is the lattice constant of Si), stacked along the y-direction, [110]. These dimensions\nare calculated from the crystal geometry, and are in agreement with the STM images published in\nRef. [9], where (337) units are shown as part of a stable reconstructed surface, Si(5 5 12)-(2 \u00d7 1).\n4\n\n\fBecause the (337) plane has two-dimensional periodicity along two non-orthogonal directions, the\nrectangular unit in Fig. 1 must be subjected to shifted periodic boundary conditions [19], with the\n\u221a\nshift in the y-direction equal to a/ 8. We build a database of structures sorted out by the number\nof atoms in the simulation cell and by their surface energy calculated with the highly optimized\nempirical potential developed by Lenosky et al. [20]. The number of atoms is varied around the\ninitial value of n = 268, in order to exhaust all the distinct possibilities that can occur during the\nsearch for low energy reconstructions.\nThe global optimization involved in building the structure database for Si(337) has been performed with the genetic algorithm adapted for crystal surfaces [17]. This algorithm is based on\nan evolutionary approach in which the members of a generation (pool of models for the surface)\nevolve with the goal of producing the best specimens, i.e. lowest energy reconstructions. The\nevolution from one generation to the next takes place by mating, which is achieved by subjecting\ntwo randomly picked structures (parents) from the pool to an operation that combines their surface features and creates a child configuration. This child structure is relaxed and considered for\ninclusion in the pool, depending on its surface energy. We use two variants of the algorithm, one in\nwhich the number of atoms is kept constant for all members of the pool at all times (the constant-n\nversion), and another one in which this restriction is not enforced (the variable-n version). The\nimplementation of this genetic algorithm has recently been described in various degrees of detail\nin Refs. [17, 18, 21]; for this reason, we will not expand upon it here, but refer the reader to those\nworks. Since the empirical potential may not give a very reliable energy ordering for a database of\nstructures, we study not only the global minima given by HOEP for different values of n, but also\nmost of the local minima that are within 15 meV/\u00c52 from the lowest energy configurations. After\ncreating the set of Si(337) model structures via the genetic algorithm, we recalculate the surface\nenergies of these minima at the level of density functional theory (DFT).\n\n5\n\n\fThe DFT calculations where performed with the plane-wave based PWscf package [22], using\nthe Perdew-Zunger [23] exchange-correlation energy. The cutoff for the plane-wave energy was set\nto 12 Ry, and the irreducible Brillouin zone was sampled using 4 k-points. The equilibrium bulk\nlattice constant was determined to be a =5.41\u00c5, which was used for all the surface calculations in\nthis work. The simulation cell has the single-face slab geometry with a total silicon thickness of\n10\u00c5 , and a vacuum thickness of 12 \u00c5. The Si atoms within a 3\u00c5-thick region at the bottom of\nthe slab are kept fixed in order to simulate the underlying bulk geometry, and the lowest layer is\npassivated with hydrogen. The remaining Si atoms are allowed to relax until the force components\non any atom become smaller than 0.025 eV/\u00c5.\nThe surface energy \u03b3 for each reconstruction is determined indirectly, by first considering the\nsurface energy \u03b30 of an unrelaxed bulk truncated slab, then by calculating the difference \u2206\u03b3 = \u03b3\u2212\u03b30\nbetween the surface energy of the actual reconstruction and the surface energy of a bulk truncated\nslab that has the bottom three layers fixed and hydrogenated. This indirect method for calculating\nthe surface energies at the DFT level was outlined, for instance, in Ref. [24]. The energy of the\nbulk truncated surface shown in Fig. 1 was found to be \u03b30 = 137.87 meV/\u00c52 . At the end of the\ngenetic algorithm search, we obtain a set of model structures which we sort by the number of atoms\nin the simulation cell and by their surface energy. These model structures are presented next.\n\n3\n\nResults\n\nThere are four possibilities in terms of the number of atoms in the slab that yield distinct global\nenergy minima of the Si(337) periodic cell shown in Fig. 1. This has been determined by performing\nconstant-n genetic algorithm optimization for computational slabs with consecutive numbers of\natoms n (264 \u2264 n \u2264 272), and identifying a periodic behavior of the lowest surface energy as a\nfunction of n. This procedure of determining the symmetry distinct numbers of atoms in the slab\n6\n\n\fhas been detailed in Ref. [16]. The HOEP global minima, as well as selected local minima of the\nsurface energy for different numbers of atoms are summarized in Table I, along with the density of\ndangling bonds per unit area and the surface energy computed at the DFT level.\nAs a general comment, the DFT energy ordering does not coincide with that given by HOEP,\nindicating that the transferability of HOEP to Si(337) is not as good as in the case of Si(001)\nand Si(105); to cope with this transferability issue, we have considered more local minima (than\nlisted in Table I) when performing DFT relaxations, as mentioned in Section 2. In the terminology\nof potential energy surface (PES) theory, we sample the main basins using the genetic algorithm\ncoupled with HOEP, then recalculate the energetic ordering of these basins using DFT. From the\ntable it is apparent that the least favorable number of atoms is n = 267 (modulo 4) at both\nthe HOEP and DFT levels. Therefore, we focus on describing here the reconstructions that have\nnumbers of atoms n = 266, 268, and 269.\nFor n = 266 the best model that we obtained at the DFT level is made of a fused assembly of\ndimers, tetramers and slightly puckered honeycombs, followed (in the [776] direction) by a row of\nrebonded atoms. These individual atomic-scale motifs have been reported previously for different\nsurfaces (e.g., [9, 14, 25]), and depicted for convenience in Fig. 2. Their complex assembly shown\nin Fig. 3(a) has a surface energy of 94.47 meV/\u00c52 ; the reconstruction 3(a) has a corrugated aspect\nwhen viewed from the [110] direction, which may account for its relatively high surface energy (refer\nto Table I). Higher-energy models with n = 266 are illustrated in Fig. 3(b,c,d), and have surface\nenergies ranging from 2.75 meV/\u00c52 to about 7 meV/\u00c52 above the surface energy of the model 3(a).\nDimers (D) and tetramers (T) can be clearly identified on model 3(b), while configuration 3(c) is\ncharacterized by the presence of honeycombs (H) and rebonded atoms (R). In model 3(d) the only\nfeatures from the set in Fig. 2 that can be separately identified are the rebonded atoms R. Nearly\ndegenerate with structure 3(d), we find two other models [3(e) and 3(f), with different tilting of\n\n7\n\n\fthe dimers belonging to tetramer groups] that contain 6-member ring \u03c0-chains [9]. The 6-member\nrings are labelled by 6-r in Fig. 3(e,f), and are supported by tetramer-like features (denoted by t\nin Fig. 3) whose dimers are made of fully coordinated atoms.\nThe optimum number of atoms is n = 268, as indicated in Table I at both HOEP and DFT\nlevels \u2013coincidentally, this is also the number of atoms that corresponds to two complete (337) bulk\ntruncated primitive cells. We have further verified this number by performing a variable-n genetic\nalgorithm started with all the members in the pool initially having n = 267 atoms. The algorithm\nhas found the correct number of atoms (n = 268) and the HOEP global minimum in less than 1000\noperations. While different starting configurations may change this rather fast evolution towards\nthe global minimum, our tests indicate that for simulation cells of similar size several thousand\ngenetic operations are sufficient when using the implementation described in Ref. [17]. The lowest\nenergy model as given by DFT is shown in Fig. 4(a) and consists of dimers D, rebonded atoms\nR and honeycombs H, in this order along [776]. We note that the number of dangling bonds is\nsmaller at the DFT level (refer to Table I): the reason for the dangling bond reduction is the\nflattening of the honeycombs (not planar at the level of empirical potentials), which creates two\nadditional bonds with the subsurface atoms. The genetic algorithm search retrieves another lowenergy model, in which the dimers are displaced towards and combine with the rebonded atoms,\nforming tetramers T [Fig. 4(b)]. The two models in Figs. 4(a) and (b) are nearly degenerate,\nwith a surface energy difference of \u2248 0.5 meV/\u00c52 relative to one another. A different number\nand ordering of the structural motifs that are present in Fig. 4(a) gives rise to a noticeably larger\nsurface energy. Specifically, the arrangement of dimers D and honeycombs H [Fig. 4(c)] increases\nthe surface energy by 4 meV/\u00c52 relative to the model 4(a). An even higher-energy reconstruction\nmade up of tetramers and rebonded atoms is shown in Fig. 4(d).\nWhen the number of atoms in the simulation cell is n = 269, we find that the ground state is\n\n8\n\n\fcharacterized by the presence of pentamers, subsurface interstitials, and rebonded atoms [refer to\nFig. 5(a)]. Interestingly, this structure is nearly flat, with the rebonded atoms being only slightly\nout the plane of the pentamers. The pentamers are \"supported\" by six-coordinated subsurface\ninterstitials. For the Si(337) cell with n = 269 atoms, we find a very strong stabilizing effect of the\npentamer-interstitial configuration: the next higher-energy structure [Fig. 5(b)] is characterized by\nadatoms and rebonded atoms, with a surface energy that is \u223c5 meV/\u00c52 higher than that of the\nground state in Fig. 5(a). We note that subsurface interstitials have long been reported in the\nliterature to have a stabilizing effect for the reconstruction of Si(113) [24]. Next, we compare the\nmodels described above with previously published works on the Si(337) structure.\n\n4\n\nDiscussion\n\nTo our knowledge, the first model of the Si(337) surface was proposed by Baski, Erwin and Whitman\nin their original work on the structure of Si(5 5 12) [9]. The model contained surface tetramers and\n6-member ring \u03c0-chains, and was similar to the structures depicted in Fig. 3(e,f). We observed a\nstrong relaxation of the \u03c0-bonded chain, in which one of the atoms of each 6-ring protrudes out\nof the surface and settles well-above its neighbors. The surface energy of the model 3(f) is not\nparticularly favorable, although it is the lowest of all the models containing 6-ring \u03c0-chains that\nwe have investigated. Heuristically speaking, if the under-coordinated atoms of the 6-rings are\nremoved (4 atoms per (2 \u00d7 1) unit cell), then one would obtain the model of Hu et al. [5], which is\nmade of dimers and tetramers. The genetic algorithm with n = 266 (modulo 4) has also retrieved\nthis model, which is shown in Fig. 3(b) after DFT relaxation.\n\u221a\nModels 3(b,e,f) have a high density of dangling bonds (db) per unit area, 10db/a2 16.75. While\nthe dangling bond density may seem to account for the large surface energy of these models, a close\ninspection of Table I shows that, in fact, there is no clear correlation between the dangling bonds\n9\n\n\fand the surface energy. For instance, at the same number of unsatured bonds per area, models\n3(b,e,f) span a 4 meV/\u00c52 range in surface energy. Furthermore, if we take the DFT model 3(a) as\nreference, we note that an increase by one db per unit cell [from 3(a) to 3(c)] results in a surface\nenergy increase of \u22487 meV/\u00c52 ; on other hand, an increase of seven db in the simulation cell [from\n3(a) to 3(b)] increases the surface energy by less than 3 meV/\u00c52 . Similar arguments for the lack\nof correlation between missing bonds and surface energy can be made by analyzing structures with\nother numbers of atoms in Table I. At the optimum number of atoms (n = 268), we find that\nwith the same dangling bond density, models 4(a,b,c) span a 4 meV/\u00c52 surface energy range: this\nrange is so large that it includes the global minimum as well as higher surface energy local minima\nthat may not be observable in usual experiments. These findings are consistent with the statement\nthat the minimization of surface energy is not controlled solely by the reduction of the dangling\nbond density, but also by the amount of surface stress caused in the process [9]. Given that the\nheuristic approaches may only account for the dangling bond density when proposing candidate\nreconstructions, the need for robust minimization procedures (e.g., [16, 17]) becomes apparent.\n\u221a\nA notable configuration with 4db/a2 16.75 is shown in Fig. 3(c), where the bonds that join\nthe (lower corner of) honeycombs and the neighbors of the rebonded atoms are markedly stretched\nbeyond their bulk value. The stretched bonds [indicated by arrows in Fig. 3(c)] cause the surface\nenergy to become very high, 100.39 meV/\u00c52 at the DFT level. Interestingly, the surface stress\n(and surface energy) is very efficiently lowered by adding dimers such that stretched bonds in\n3(c) are broken, and the dimers \"bridge\" over as shown in Fig. 4(a). The addition of one dimer\nper simulation cell results in the most stable Si(337) reconstruction that we found, with \u03b3 \u2248 89\nmeV/\u00c52 . A structure similar to 4(a) was previously proposed by Liu and coworkers [13] to explain\ntheir HRTEM data. These authors also proposed a possible configuration for the other unit of (337)\nthat is part of the large Si(5 5 12) unit cell, which has essentially the same bonding topology as 4(b).\n\n10\n\n\fAlthough no atomic scale calculations were performed in Ref. [13], the two (337) models of Liu et al.\nwere in qualitative agreement with more recent DFT results by Jeong et al. [14], as well as with STM\nand HRTEM images. When performing ab-initio relaxations, we found that the HOEP models that\ncorresponded most closely to those in Ref. [13] end up relaxing into the configurations put forth by\nJeong and coworkers [14]. The structures shown in Fig. 4(a,b) allow for (337) nanofacets to intersect\n(113) facets without any bond breaking or rebonding. This absence of facet-edge rebonding, as well\nas the relatively low energy of Si(337), give rise to short-range attractive interactions between steps\non miscut Si(113) [26], which is consistent with the experimental observation of (337) step-bunched\nphases [11].\n\n5\n\nConclusions\n\nIn summary, we have presented an investigation of the Si(337)-(2 \u00d7 1) reconstructions based on\na genetic algorithm search for the most favorable atomic configuration [17, 21]. We have coupled\nthe algorithm with the HOEP model [20] for atomic interactions in order to efficiently create a\ndatabase of Si(337) models. Since no empirical interatomic potential can be expected to be fully\ntransferable to arbitrary surface orientations, we have relaxed the database reconstructions using\nab initio DFT calculations. The DFT relaxations give a more accurate idea about the relative\nstability of the reconstructions found, and help identify the likely lowest-energy candidates that\nare shown in Fig. 4(a) and (b). As it turns out, the two models coincide with those proposed\nby Jeong and coworkers [14] from STM experiments and density functional calculations. This\nfinding lends strong support to the minimization approach taken here and shows that sampling\nthe configuration space using the HOEP potential [20] is a versatile way to find good candidate\nreconstructions for high-index Si surfaces. We hope that the development of algorithms for surface\nstructure determination [16, 17] would also stimulate further research towards interatomic potentials\n11\n\n\fwith improved transferability, since the use of such potentials will improve the quality of the model\nstructures found during the global optimization: in turn, this would increase the range of materials\nproblems where the search algorithms can be used to gain knowledge of optimal structure.\nThe DFT surface energies of the (337) models shown in Fig. 4(a,b) are relatively small, being\nabout 1 meV/\u00c52 higher than the surface energy of Si(114) computed using the same computational\nparameters Section 2. Upon analyzing the results of the genetic algorithm optimization, we have\nseen that the (337) structures with low surface energies correspond to certain spatial arrangements\nof atomic-scale motifs (Fig. 2), rather than to a minimum number of dangling bonds per unit\ncell. In experiments, particular conditions can readily appear such as to favor the stabilization of\nSi(337) over Si(5 5 12), as shown for instance in Refs. [3, 4]. Recent works by Baski and coworkers\n[27] reveal a controlled way in which Si(337) facets can be formed \u2013the deposition of gold. At Au\ncoverages of 0.15 ML, the (5 5 12) orientation facets into Si(113) and Si(337), with the (337) surface\nunit cells being twice as large as the ones in Fig. 1 along the [776] direction. Since the Au coverages\nat which Si(337) emerges correspond to only a couple of Au atoms per each (337) unit, the models\npresented here can be used as building blocks for the structure of Si(337)-Au nanofacets observed\nin [27], as well as in other experimental situations.\nAcknowledgments.
