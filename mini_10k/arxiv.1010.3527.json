2018\nAbstract\nIt is shown that quasi all continuous functions on the unit circle have\nthe property that, for many small subsets E of the circle, the partial\nsums of their Fourier series considered as functions restricted to E exhibit\ncertain universality properties.\n\nAMS-classification: 42A63,42A65,54E52\nKeywords: universal divergence, Fourier series, Baire's theorem\n\n1\n\nIntroduction and results\n\nSince Du Bois Reymond's work it is known that Fourier series of continuous\nfunctions may diverge in some points of the unit circle T = R/2\u03c0Z. Of course, in\nview of Carleson's theorem, this can only happen on a set of vanishing Lebesgue\nmeasure.\nActually, nowadays divergence is seen as generic phenomenon:\nLet (X, d) be a complete metric space. A property is said to be satisfied by quasi\nall x \u2208 X if it is satisfied on a residual set in X (that is, on a set containing a\ndense G\u03b4 set).\nWe consider, for compact sets E \u2282 T,\nC(E) := {f : E \u2192 C, f continuous},\n\n||f ||E := max |f (t)|\nt\u2208E\n\nas well as || * || := || * ||T .\nThen quasi all f \u2208 (C(T), || * ||) enjoy the property that their Fourier series\ndiverge in quasi all points of T (see, for example, Theorem 1.1 in Kahane's\nexpository paper [Kah] which is a rich source of related results).\nThe question arises to what extend divergence of (sn f )n , where sn f denotes the\nn-th partial sum of the Fourier series of f , may take place for such functions. Our\nfirst result shows that for countable E \u2282 T the divergence may be \"maximal\"\non E:\n\n1\n\n\fTheorem 1 For each countable set E \u2282 T quasi all f \u2208 C(T) enjoy the property\nthat for every function h : E \u2192 C there is a subsequence of (sn f ) converging\npointwise to h on E.\nProofs are postponed to Section 2.\nThe question arises which uncountable sets E show a \"pointwise universality\"\nproperty as in Theorem 1 for some f \u2208 C(T). Of course, possible limit functions\nare resticted to the first Baire class. It is well-known that trigonometric series\n(and even Taylor series of functions holomorphic in the unit disk) exist with\nthe property that every function of the first Baire class is a pointwise limit\nof a subsequence of the series on T (see, e.g. [Kah], Corollary 2.3, and [Nes]).\nHowever, in the case of Fourier series of continuous functions Carleson's theorem\nshows that E must have vanishing Lebesgue measure and, moreover, it turns\nout that universal divergence sets also have to be topologicaly small in the sense\nof being of first category. This is in some contrast to the well-known fact that\nevery set E of vanishing measure is a set of (unbounded) divergence for some\nf \u2208 C(T) (see, e. g. [Kat], Theorem II 3.4).\nIn fact, from Carleson's theorem we can easily obtain that f has special attraction as limit point not only almost everywhere but also quasi everywhere:\nIf f \u2208 C(T) and (nj ) are so that (snj f )j converges pointwise to some function\nh on a set A \u2282 T, then h differs from f at most on a set of first category.\nThis follows immediately from\nProposition 1 If f \u2208 C(T) and (snj f )j is a subsequence of (sn f )n then there\nis a dense G\u03b4 -subset E of T so that for all t \u2208 E a subsequence of (snj f (t))\ntends to f (t).\nWe may also ask about uniform convergence of subsequences of (sn f ) on subsets\nE of the unit circle. If {sn f|E : n \u2208 N} is dense in C(E) we say that (sn f ) is\nuniformly universal on E. Denoting by K(T) the (complete) metric space of all\ncompact, nonempty subsets of T equipped with the Hausdorff metric, we have\nTheorem 2 Quasi all continuous functions on T enjoy that property that (sn f )\nis uniformly universal on quasi all sets E \u2208 K(T).\nIt can be shown (see [K\u00f6]) that quasi all elements of K(T) are perfect sets. In\nparticular, there are perfect \u2013 and thus uncountable \u2013 sets E so that (sn f ) is\nuniformly universal on E for some f \u2208 C(T). Again, it would be interesting\nto know for which sets E \u2208 K(T) such functions exist. Due to Carleson's theorem, they necessarily have to have vanishing Lebesgue measure, and thus are\nin particular nowhere dense in T. The proofs in Section 2 show that a \"localized version\" of Theorem 2 is true, i.e. for each compact set E0 \u2282 T quasi all\nf \u2208 C(T) are so that (sn f ) is uniformly universal on E for quasi all E \u2208 K(E0 ).\n\n2\n\n\fSince C(T) is dense in Lp (T) for all 1 \u2264 p < \u221e, and since sn : Lp (T) \u2192 C(T)\nis continuous for all n, the proofs in Section 2 show that the Theorems 1 and\n2 also hold with Lp (T) instead of C(T). In view of Kolmogorov's result on\nthe divergence everwhere of Fourier series of (quasi-all) L1 -functions (see [Kah],\nTheorem 1.5), it is reasonable to suspect that in the L1 -case not only sets E of\nvanishing Lebesgue measure are permitted. However, compact sets E such that\n(sn f ) is uniformly universal on E for some integrable f still have to be nowhere\ndense (see [Kah], p. 157).\n\n2\n\nProofs\n\nThe key tool is\nLemma 1 For all finite sets E \u2282 T\n\b\nf \u2208 C(T) : {sn f : n \u2208 N} dense in CE (= C(E))\nis a dense G\u03b4 -set in C(T).\nProof\n1. We show that for all g \u2208 C(T), c \u2208 C, \u03b5 > 0, \u039b \u2282 N, |\u039b| = \u221e there is\nf \u2208 C(T), n \u2208 \u039b, so that\nkf \u2212 gk < \u03b5,\n\n(sn f )(0) = c.\n\nIndeed: The Weierstrass approximation theorem implies the existence of a trigonometric polynomial q with kg \u2212 qk < \u03b5/2.\n\u0001\nFor quasi all f \u2208 C(T) the sequence sn f (0) n\u2208\u039b is unbounded (this is a wellknown consequence of the Banach-Steinhaus theorem in the case \u039b = N and\nmay be obtained in the same way for arbitrary \u039b, since the L1 -norms of the n-th\nDirichlet kernel tend to infinity). Therefore, there is a h \u2208 C(T) with khk < \u03b5/2\nand (sn h)(0) > c \u2212 q(0) for some n \u2208 \u039b, n \u2265 deg (q). Then\nc \u2212 q(0)\ne\nh :=\n*h\nsn h(0)\nsatisfies\n\nh(0) = c \u2212 q(0)\nsn e\n\nand\n\nke\nhk \u2264 khk < \u03b5/2\n\nand thus for f := e\nh + q we obtain (since n \u2265 deq (q))\nkf \u2212 gk < \u03b5\n\nand\n\nh)(0) + q(0) = c.\n(sn f )(0) = (sn e\n\nAccording to the Universality Criterion (see, for example, [GE]), applied to the\nsequence Tn : C(T) \u2192 C with Tn f := (sn f )(0) (n \u2208 \u039b, f \u2208 C(T)) the set\n\b\nf \u2208 C(T) : {(sn f )(0) : n \u2208 \u039b} dense in C (= C{0} )\n3\n\n\fis G\u03b4 -dense in C(T).\n2. We prove the assertion by induction on N = |E|.\nFor N = 1 the result follows from part 1 of the proof (without loss of generality\nwe may suppose E = {0}).\nLet E \u2282 T with |E| = N + 1 be given. Again, we suppose that 0 \u2208 E. We write\nE = F \u222a {0} with |F | = N . Then by induction hypothesis, {sn (f ) : n \u2208 N} is\ndense in CF for quasi all f \u2208 C(T).\nThe universality criterion, now applied to Tn : C(T) \u2192 CE , Tn f := sn f|E , (n \u2208\nN, f \u2208 C(T)), shows that it is sufficient (and necessary) to guarantee that for\nall g \u2208 C(T), \u03b5 > 0, h : E \u2192 C there exist f \u2208 C(T) and n \u2208 N with\nkf \u2212 gk < \u03b5\n\nand\n\nksn f \u2212 hkE < \u03b5.\n\nDue to the Weierstrass approximation theorem, we may suppose that g is a\ntrigonometric polynomial.\nLet u \u2208 C(T) be so that kuk < \u03b5/2, and let \u039b \u2282 N satisfy |\u039b| = \u221e and\n\u0001\n(n \u2208 \u039b, t \u2208 F ).\n(sn u)(t) \u2212 h(t) \u2212 g(t) < \u03b5/3\nBy 1. there are v \u2208 C(T), kvk < \u03b5/2 and \u039b\u2032 \u2282 \u039b, |\u039b\u2032 | = \u221e so that\n\u0001\n(sn v)(0) \u2212 h(0) \u2212 g(0) < \u03b5/3\n(n \u2208 \u039b\u2032 ).\nNow, consider \u03c6 \u2208 C(T) with 0 \u2264 \u03c6 \u2264 1 and\n\u03c6|U \u2261 1 ,\n\n\u03c6|V \u2261 0\n\nfor neighborhoods U of F and V of 0 in T. The Localization Principle (see e.\ng. [Kat], Theorem II 2.4) implies that\nksn (u\u03c6) \u2212 sn ukF < \u03b5/3 ,\nand\n\n\u0001\nsn v(1 \u2212 \u03c6) (0) \u2212 (sn v)(0) < \u03b5/3,\n\nsn (u\u03c6)(0) < \u03b5/3\nsn (1 \u2212 \u03c6)v\n\n\u0001\n\nF\n\n< \u03b5/3\n\nfor n sufficiently large. We define\nf := u\u03c6 + v(1 \u2212 \u03c6) + g.\nThen kf \u2212 gk \u2264 kuk + kvk < \u03b5 and for n \u2208 \u039b\u2032 with n \u2265 deg(g) we have (since\nsn g = g)\n\u0001\nksn f \u2212 hkF \u2264\nsn v(1 \u2212 \u03c6) + ksn (u\u03c6) + g \u2212 hkF\n\u03b5\n\u2264\n+ ksn (u\u03c6) \u2212 sn ukF + sn u \u2212 (h \u2212 g) F < \u03b5\n3\nand similarly\n|(sn f )(0) \u2212 h(0)| \u2264 (sn (u\u03c6)(0) +\n\n\u0001\nsn (v(1 \u2212 \u03c6)) (0) + g(0) \u2212 h(0) < \u03b5.\n4\n\n\f\u2737\nProof of Theorem 1\nLet (Ej )j\u2208N be an exhaustion of E consisting of finite sets. Then by Lemma\n1 and Baire's theorem quasi all f \u2208 C(T) are so that the partial sums sn f are\ndense in CEj for all j \u2208 N. If f is of that kind, and if h : E \u2192 C is given, then\nfor all j there is an integer nj > nj\u22121 with ||snj f \u2212 h||Ej < 1/j. Thus (snj f )\nconverges pointwise to h on E.\n\u2737\nProof of Proposition 1\nWe have\n{t \u2208 T : \u2203(jl )l : (snjl f )(t) \u2192 f (t)}\n\n\\\n\n=\n\n[ n\n\nt : snj f (t) \u2212 f (t) <\n\nm,k\u2208N j\u2265m\n\n\\\n\n=:\n\n1o\nk\n\nOm,k\n\nm,k\u2208N\n\nwith Om,k open in T. According to Baire's theorem, it is sufficient to show that\nOm,k is dense for all (m, k).\nSuppose that there is some (m, k) with Om,k not dense in T. Then, for all t \u2208 U\nwhere U is the complement of the closure of Om,k ,\nsnj f (t) \u2212 f (t) \u2265\n\n1\nk\n\n(j \u2265 m).\n\nThis contradicts the fact that sn f (t) \u2192 f (t) on a dense subset of T (following\nfrom Carleson's theorem).\n\u2737\nTheorem 2 is an immediate consequence of Lemma 1 and the following Lemma\n(applied with X = C(T), I = N, and (Tn ) = (sn )).\nLemma 2 Let X be a complete metric space, and let (T\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208I be a family of\nfunctions T\u03b1 : X \u2192 C(T). If, for all finite E \u2282 T, the set {T\u03b1 (x)|E : \u03b1 \u2208 I} is\ndense in CE for quasi all x \u2208 X, then {T\u03b1 (x)|E : \u03b1 \u2208 I} is dense in C(E) for\nquasi all x \u2208 X and quasi all E \u2208 K(T).\nProof\n1. Let x \u2208 X be fixed. Then\n\b\nEx := E \u2208 K(T) : {T\u03b1 (x)|E : \u03b1 \u2208 I} dense in C(E)\nis a G\u03b4 -set in K(T).\nIndeed: Let Q denote the set of all trigonometric polynomials with\n\u0001 coefficients\nfrom Q + iQ. Then Q is countable and dense in C(E), k * kE according to\n5\n\n\fTietze's extension theorem and the Weierstrass approximation theorem. Now\nEx =\n\n\\ [n\n\nk\u2208N\nq\u2208Q\n\nE \u2208 K(T) : kT\u03b1 (x) \u2212 qkE <\n\n\u03b1\u2208I\n\n1o\n.\nk\n\nSince T\u03b1 (x) \u2212 q is uniformly continuous on T, we see that\n{E \u2208 K(T) : kT\u03b1 (x) \u2212 qkE <\n\n1\n}\nk\n\nis open in K(T), and this shows that Ex is a G\u03b4 -set in K(T).\n2. We fix a countable dense subset M of T. Let E denote the family of all finite\nsubsets of M . Then E is countable and dense in K(T). According to Baire's\ntheorem,\n\\\n{x \u2208 X : {T\u03b1 (x)|E : \u03b1 \u2208 I} dense in CE }\nE\u2208E\n\nis a residual subset of X. For all x in this set we have E \u2282 Ex and thus the first\npart of proof shows that Ex is G\u03b4 -dense in K(T).\n\u2737\n\nReferences\n[GE] K. G.
