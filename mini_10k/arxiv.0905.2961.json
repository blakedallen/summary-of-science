As a result, unity-efficient conversion is expected in a resonator with feasible parameters.\nPACS numbers: 41.20.Jb, 42.65.Wi, 42.65.Ky\n\nI.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nNonlinear frequency conversion of far-infrared or microwave signals into the optical domain has been actively\nused for detection of such signals [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9].\nThe relative ease of optical signal detection compared\nto e.g. those in the sub-THz range, in combination with\nan intrinsically noiseless character of nonlinear frequency\nconversion, explains the close attention this method has\nbeen receiving. Its main drawback, however, is its low\nconversion efficiency. The highest power conversion efficiency known to us is about 0.5%, which has been only\nrecently achieved for 100 GHz signal using 16 mW of\nCW optical pump at 1560 nm [9]. This number corresponds to the photon-number conversion efficiency of approximately 2.6 * 10\u22126 , as follows from the Manley-Rowe\nrelation.\nHighly efficient and noiseless upconversion of microwave radiation into the optical domain would open\nup numerous possibilities in microwave imaging and communications. One example of such a possibility, that we\nhave discussed earlier [9], is microwave photon counting at room temperature. Reaching the photon-counting\nregime in the sub-THz or THz range would be an achievement important for quantum information processing and\ncomputing, sub-millimeter spectroscopy and astronomy,\nsecurity, and for other areas where the ultimate sensitivity detection of microwave radiation is desired. Unfortunately, even the most efficient up-converter to-date\nis still seven orders of magnitude short of the photoncounting regime for 100 GHz photons at room temperature [9]. On the other hand, the theoretical analysis [10]\nshows that this regime can be achieved. The key to its\nrealization is reaching unity conversion efficiency. An allresonant whispering gallery mode (WGM) configuration\nof the frequency converter should achieve this goal.\nWGM resonators with optical nonlinearity have been\nsuccessfully used in nonlinear optics in general and in microwave photonics in particular [11, 12, 13, 14, 15]. In a\nrecent experiment [9] a lithium niobate WGM resonator\n\nwith the optical free spectral range (FSR) \u03a9 = 2\u03c0 * 12.64\nGHz was irradiated by a microwave signal with the frequency near \u03c9M = 8 * \u03a9 \u2248 2\u03c0 * 101.12 GHz. This device\nis analogous to a lower-frequency electro-optical modulator [12, 13, 14], except that the microwave signal excites\nthe sidebands not in the pair of adjacent to the carrier\noptical WGMs, but in those across eight of optical FSRs.\n\nII.\n\nGENERAL THEORETICAL\nCONSIDERATION\n\nTo describe the operation of such a modulator, we follow the steps of [13] and introduce the interaction Hamiltonian\n\u0124i = h\u0304g(b\u0302\u2020\u2212 \u0109\u2020 \u00e2 + b\u0302+ \u0109\u2020 \u00e2\u2020 ) + c.c.,\n\n(1)\n\nwhich couples the optical pump and microwave signal\nWGMs (photon annihilation operators \u00e2 and \u0109, respectively) with the Stokes and anti-Stokes optical upconverted signal (b\u0302\u2212 and b\u0302+ , respectively). In case of a single side-band modulation [14] only one, either the Stokes\nor the anti-Stokes, term is present in Hamiltonian (1).\nThe coupling constant\nr\n\u0012 Z\n\u0013\nna nb \u03c0h\u0304\u03c9c 1\ng = \u03c90 rij\n(2)\ndV \u03a8\u2217a \u03a8b \u03a8c\nnc\n2Vc\nV V\nincludes the (bracketed) factor describing the overlap\nbetween the fields inside the resonator. In Eq. (2),\n\u03c9a \u2248 \u03c9b \u2261 \u03c90 is the optical frequency, na,b are the refraction indices and Va \u2248 Vb \u2261 V is the optical mode\nvolume; \u03c9c , nc and Vc are similar microwave parameters.\nThe effective electro-optical coefficient rij is determined\nby the fields configuration.\nIrradiating the resonator with the microwaves by placing the former near a waveguide opening is a very inefficient method of coupling the microwaves with the optical\nWGMs, as the main part of the microwave energy reflects\n\n\f2\n\n\u03c9a =\n\ncLa\n,\nRna\n\n(3)\n\nwhere La is the orbital momentum for this WGM, and\nR is the resonator radius. Similar equations hold for the\nStokes and anti-Stokes frequencies \u03c9b\u00b1 .\nThe Hamiltonian (1) and Eq. (2) lead to the following\nphase-matching conditions, that are essentially the energy and angular momentum conservation equations for\nthe anti-Stokes and Stokes processes:\n\u03c9b\u00b1 = \u03c9a \u00b1 \u03c9c\n\nand Lb\u00b1 = La \u00b1 Lc ,\n\n(4)\n\nSubtracting Eq. (3) for \u03c9a from that for \u03c9b\u00b1 and making substitution (4), we find the phase-matching equation\n\u03c9c (Lc ) = \u03a9b Lc \u00b1 \u03c9a (na \u2212 nb )/nb\n\n(5)\n\nfor the anti-Stokes (plus) and Stokes (minus) conversion\nprocesses. In (5) \u03a9b = c/(Rnb ) is the optical FSR for the\nsignal WGM. We have neglected its frequency dispersion\nreplacing nb\u00b1 \u2261 nb , but kept the distinction between na\nand nb which is due to the birefringence.\nThe phase matching condition (5) needs to be solved\njointly with the microwave dispersion equation, which depends on the resonator geometry. Previously [17] we have\nobserved lower frequency microwave WGMs in lithium\nniobate disks in the 30 GHz range. One important conclusion of that study has been that the microwave WGMs\nin a disk resonator have poor spatial overlap with the optical modes that occupy just a few tens of microns near\nthe disk rim. This greatly reduces the overlap factor in\n(2). Therefore we decided to use ring resonators, made so\nthat the optical axis of the crystal is parallel to the ring\naxis. When filled with a low-constant dielectric, such a\nring tends to concentrate the microwave field inside, enforcing a better overlap with the optical WGMs.\nOnce the phase-matching conditions are fulfilled, the\nmicrowaves-to-optics conversion will be efficient as long\nas the nonlinear coupling rate exceeds the loss rate in\nthe microwave WGM, that is, if the total loss rate of\nthe THz mode \u03b3 = \u03b3nl + \u03b3abs is dominated by the rate\nof nonlinear frequency conversion \u03b3nl . Experimentally\nthis means that the microwave WGM resonances will be\nconsiderably broadened when the optical pump is turned\non. Then if the optical WGMs couple strongly to the\ninput and output free-space beams (i.e. the resonator\nis optically over-coupled) the unity-efficient conversion is\ntheoretically possible [10].\n\nEfficient in- and out-coupling of the optical WGMs requires the external rim of the ring to be shaped as a\nspheroid with the radii ratio equal to [9]\nn2p \u2212 n2\n\u03c1\n=\n,\nR\nn2p\n\n(6)\n\nwhere np is the refraction index of the prism used for the\noptical coupling. Let us assume for the rest of the paper\nthat the optical pump has the wavelength \u03bb = 1.55 \u03bcm\n(\u03c90 = 1.2 * 1015 s\u22121 ) . Then for a diamond prism np =\n2.384, while e.g. for lithium niobate na,b = ne = 2.138.\nTherefore according to (6), \u03c1/R = 0.196.\nIII.\n\nTYPE-I UP-CONVERSION\n\nLet us find the phase matching solutions. First, we\nassume that the microwave as well as both optical fields\nare polarized along the optical axis, so that the largest\nnonlinearity coefficient of lithium niobate d33 is used. In\nthis configuration, which we dub Type-I up-conversion,\nna = nb and the last term in Eq. (5) disappears. To\nfind the phase-matching solutions, we plot Eq. (5) together with the microwave dispersion curve, see Fig. 1.\nIntersection of the two curves at an integer value of Lc\nindicates that the phase-matching is achieved. The accuracy to which the two frequencies should match at this\nvalue of Lc is determined by the smaller of the optical\nand microwave WGM linewidths. Notice that the microwave dispersion curve (B) in Fig. 1 depends on all\nfour geometric parameters of the ring, while the phasematching curve (A) depends only on the external radius\nR. This gives us enough freedom to achieve the phasematching at a desired microwave frequency. In the example shown in Fig. 1 the phase-matching was found for\n\u03c9c = 2\u03c0 * 100.0 GHz at Lc = 13. The ring thickness was\n115\n\nMode frequency (GHz)\n\nback into the waveguide or scatters into space. This problem can be solved by using an all-resonant frequency upconverter, supporting microwave WGMs as well as optical ones. Experimental studies of microwave WGMs in\ncrystalline disks and rings carried out in the 1980's shown\nremarkable quality factors of Q \u2248 1010 [16].\nFor the all-resonant up-converter, all wave functions\n\u03a8 in (2) are optical or microwave eigenfunctions of the\nWGM resonator. The eigenfrequencies \u03c9a (La ) of the\nmain family of the optical WGMs is found [13] as\n\n(A)\n\n110\n\n105\n\n(B)\n\n100\n\n95\n\n90\n\n85\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\nOrbital momentum\n\nFIG. 1: A phase-matching solution for lithium niobate, TypeI up-conversion, is achieved at \u03c9c = 2\u03c0 * 100 GHz, Lc =\n13.

The plot is on a log scale with color map given\non the right. A sketch of the geometry is shown in the inset,\nwhere the red box represents the calculation window.\n\nh = 292 \u03bcm, its inner and outer radii were Rin = 2.48\nmm and R = 2.9 mm, and the rim curvature found from\n(6) was \u03c1 = 568 \u03bcm.\nThe microwave dispersion curve is obtained by numerical simulation. These simulations have been carried out\nin a finite element solver, COMSOL [18] adapting an axis\nsymmetrical formulation by Oxborrow [19]. Fused silica\nwas selected as the post material because of its low microwave absorption and relatively small microwave refraction index (n=1.9 at 100 GHz), compared to the\nlarger values ne = 5.15 and no = 6.72 for lithium niobate [20]. In this configuration the microwave field is\nstrongly concentrated inside of the resonator ring, see\nFig. 2, which provides both good coupling with the external waveguide and good overlap with the optical field.\nWe would like to point out that the purpose of the\nnumeric simulation is not to achieve the exact phasematching, but only to unambiguously determine the angular momentum Lc . An error small compared to the\nmicrowave FSR would be tolerable, because the phase\nmatching can be fine-tuned via modifying the microwave\ndispersion of the system. For example, placing a metal\nring on the fused silica post near the resonator ring, we\nhave been able to tune the microwave frequency by more\nthan 0.5 GHz without appreciable degradation of the\nquality factor.\nIV.\n\nTYPE-II UP-CONVERSION\n\nNow let us consider the Type-II up-conversion, i.e.\nwhen the signal polarization is orthogonal to the pump\npolarization [14]. In this case the birefringence term in\n(5) does not vanish. In fact, in strongly birefringent materials it can be quite large. In lithium niobate, for example, it is equal to approximately \u00b12\u03c0 * 6.6 THz. The\n\"plus\" sign corresponds to either anti-Stokes conversion\nof the ordinary polarized pump, or Stokes conversion of\nthe extraordinary polarized pump. Similarly, the \"mi-\n\n76\n\n77\n\n78\n\n79\n\n80\n\nOrbital momentum\n\nFIG. 3: Phase-matching solutions for lithium tantalate, TypeII up-conversion, can be achieved at Lc = 76, 77, 78 with the\nDC bias voltages shown on the plot. Curve (A) is the phasematching curve resulting from Eq. (5); curve (B) is the microwave dispersion curve calculated numerically.\n\nnus\" sign corresponds to either Stokes conversion of the\nextraordinary polarized pump, or anti-Stokes conversion\nof the ordinary polarized pump. It is easy to see that\nneither situation allows for the phase matching solution\ncompatible with the microwave dispersion equation and\nlying in the transparency window of lithium niobate.\nThe Type-II up-conversion can be realized, however, in\nweakly birefringent materials. For example, in stoichiometric lithium tantalate the birefringence term is equal\nto approximately \u00b12\u03c0 * 0.366 THz [21]. While the \"positive\" solution is still impossible, the \"negative\" phase\nmatching solution now can be achieved, see Fig. 3. One\nimportant distinction between the Type-I and Type-II\nconfigurations is that in the latter the microwave field\nhas to be polarized in the plane of the ring, as required\nfor efficient nonlinear coupling [14]. The radial field distribution for one of the microwave WGMs found in Fig. 3\nis shown in Fig. 4.\nFor the numeric simulations shown in Figs. 3 and 4\nwe used the microwave refraction index of lithium tantalate ne \u2248 no = 6.5 [22]. All sizes of this ring were taken\nthe same as for the lithium niobate ring, except the inner\nradius that was assumed to be 2.61 mm. In these simulations we have not attempted to achieve the integer-valued\nsolution by adjusting the ring sizes. Instead, we take advantage of the fact that the ordinary and extraordinary\noptical WGM families can be frequency-tuned relative to\neach other by temperature, or by bias DC voltage. For\nvoltage tuning, the viable case of Eq.

Equation (7) allows us to\n\n\f4\ncalculate the bias voltages required to achieve the phase\nmatching in three cases shown in Fig. 3.\nWe have already pointed out that the microwave\nWGMs also can be frequency-tuned by a significant fraction of their FSR. It is interesting to contemplate a\npossibility of making a broadly-tunable microwave upconverter enabled by the combination of tunable phasematching (7) and tunable microwave WGMs.\nV.\n\nCONVERSION EFFICIENCY\n\nTo estimate the Type-I conversion efficiency, we use\nthe result by [13] for the ratio of the optical sidebands\npowers P\u00b1 to the pump power P0 in an electro-optical\nmodulator:\ns\n\u221a\n\u00132\n\u0012\nP\u00b1\n4gQ QM\n2\u03be PM\n=\n,\n(8)\n, \u03be=\nP0\n1 + 2\u03be 2 PM\n\u03c90\nh\u0304\u03c9c2\nwhere Q and QM are the optical and microwave WGM\nquality factors, respectively, and PM is the microwave\npower. We are interested in up-conversion of very low\nmicrowave powers, eventually at the single photon levels,\nwhich allows us to make the approximation 1 + 2\u03be 2 PM \u2248\n1, turn Eq. (8) around and find the up-conversion efficiency in terms of the photon numbers:\n\u03c9c\n< N\u00b1 >\nP\u00b1 \u03c9c\n\u2248 4\u03be 2 P0 .\n=\n< NM >\nPM \u03c90\n\u03c90\n\n(9)\n\nOur numerical simulations allow us to estimate the\ncoupling constant (2) and to find the optical pump power\nP0 required for conversion efficiency (9) to approach\nunity. Near the unity conversion efficiency the estimate\n(9) may not be accurate, and saturation effects need to be\ntaken into account. However the purpose of our estimate\nis to show that nearly absolute conversion efficiency can\nbe achieved even with modest assumptions concerning\nthe system parameters.\n\nFor the Type-I up-conversion in lithium niobate, rij =\nr33 = 29 pm/V = 8.7 * 10\u22127 esu [23], na,b = 2.137 and\nnc = 5.15. The eigenfunctions of the optical modes\nare practically equivalent, \u03a8a \u2248 \u03a8b , and the microwave\neigenfunction \u03a8c can be treated as a constant and taken\nout from the integral. The \"mode volume\" V in (2) is\ndefined as a volume integral of the absolute square of\nthe eigenfunction. Therefore the optical mode volume\ncancels out, while the microwave mode volume and field\namplitude at the optical WGM location are estimated\nbased on the simulation data. To complete the estimate\nwe assume Q = 108 and QM = 100. Substituting these\nnumbers into Eq. (9) we find the photon-number conversion efficiency approaching unity (1/2 for the Stokes,\nand 1/2 for the anti-Stokes conversion efficiencies) at the\noptical pump power P0 \u224850 mW.\nFor the Type-II up-conversion in lithium tantalate,\nrij = r42 = r51 = 20 pm/V = 6*10\u22127 esu [23], na,b = 2.12\nand nc = 6.5, [24, 25]. Eq. (8) in this case remains the\nsame except for the factor 2 in the denominator, which\ndoes not affect the expression for the conversion efficiency\n(9). The latter approaches unity at P0 \u2248 120 mW.\nVI.\n\nDEMONSTRATION OF MICROWAVE\nWGMS\n\nAs an experimental demonstration, we machined a\nlithium niobate ring closely matching the parameters calculated above and mounted it on a slightly tapered fused\nsilica post as shown in Fig. 5. In this experiment the\nouter rim of the ring was shaped as a cylinder (\u03c1 = \u221e)\ninstead of a spheroid, which had little effect on its microwave spectrum. At the mounting location, the outer\nradius of the silica stem was 2.48 mm. However due to\nthe roughness and tapering caused by the drilling process, the effective inner radius of the lithium niobate ring\nwas slightly larger. In our analysis we treated this radius\nas a free parameter and found an excellent agreement be-\n\nLiTaO3\nSiO2\n\nFIG. 4: Absolute value of the Er -component of a microwave\nWGM mode in a lithium tantalate resonator with \u03c9c = 2\u03c0*238\nGHz, Lc = 80.

In this experiment we used a fused silica rod\nstretched over a hydrogen torch to approximately half of\nits initial diameter of 3 mm. This technique allowed us to\nachieve the optimal coupling by translating the resonator\nalong the waveguide until their effective microwave refraction indices match. We gradually polished the disk\nrim, reducing the outer radius from its initial value of\n2.99 mm to 2.90 mm. The microwave dispersion curves\nwere thereby shifted, see Fig. 6.\nThe thin ring used in our experiment acts as a looped\nsingle-mode microwave waveguide. Therefore the mode\nsequence in Fig. 6 is indexed by the orbital number Lc\ndetermined from the numeric simulation. The simulated\ndispersion curves are also shown in Fig. 6. The microwave\nspectrum for the final value R = 2.90 mm is shown in\nFig. 7. From this spectrum we see that signal coupling\nfrom the THz waveguide into the resonator as high as\n82% was achieved. We determine the microwave WGM\nquality factor to be Q \u2248 100.\n\nWaveguide transmission\n\nVII.\n1.0\n\n0.8\n\n0.6\n\n13\n0.4\n\n12\n7\n\n11\n\n0.2\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n0.0\n90\n\n93\n\n96\n\n99\n\n102\n\n105\n\n108\n\nFrequency (GHz)\n\nSUMMARY\n\nTo summarize, we have studied microwave WGMs in\nthe ring resonators. The purpose of this study has\nbeen to determine the utility of such systems as efficient\nmicrowave-to-optics converters, with the focus made\non efficient coupling of microwaves into the resonator's\nWGMs; improving the overlap between the microwave\nand optical fields; and theoretical demonstration of the\nphase-matching for desired signal frequency. All of this\nhas been achieved, and we believe that the actual demonstration of nearly unity-efficient microwave-to-optics conversion with subsequent optical photon counting is now\nfeasible. The benefits from its practical implementation\nare expected in the areas of quantum information (e.g.,\nquantum computing with quantum electronic circuits),\nastronomy and spectroscopy.\n\nFIG. 7: Microwave spectrum of the ring resonator shown in\nFig. 5.
