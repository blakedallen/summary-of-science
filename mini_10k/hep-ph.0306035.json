Neutrino mass matrix and mixing\nGenerally in GUTs, there appear some right-handed neutrinos \u03a8I (1) = \u03bdRI\n(I = 1, * * * , n); for instance, n = 3 in SO(10) and n = 6 in E6 .

The 2-3 mixing is also large in the charged lepton mixing\nmatrix Ul as we have seen above, and so is it generally in the MNS matrix\nUMNS = Ul U\u03bd\u2020 unless a cancellation occurs between Ul and U\u03bd .\nSecond, it is natural to assume that three neutrino masses are not so\ndegenerate accidentally.

Conclusion\nI have shown the following points in this paper:\n(1) If we assume Froggatt-Nielsen's factorized form for the quark/lepton\nmass matrices and the SU (5) structure for the U (1)X charges, an\ninput of up- and down-type quark masses necessarily implies that\nthe 2-3 mixing is large in the MNS matrix UMNS .\n\n\fDecember 12, 2018\n\n4:1\n\nWSPC/Trim Size: 9in x 6in for Proceedings\n\nnoon03\n\n8\n\nq\n(2) If we further add the data \u25b3m2\u2299 /\u25b3m2atm \u223c \u03bb, then, it implies\nthat the 1-2 mixing in UMNS is also large, so leading to bi-large\nmixing.\n(3) The measurement of Ue3 will confirm or kill the basic idea of\nFroggatt-Nielsen mechanism for explaining the hierarchical mass\nstructures of quarks and leptons.\nAcknowledgments\nI would like to thank Masako Bando for collaborations in the work which\nthis talk is based on.
