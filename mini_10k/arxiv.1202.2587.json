In addition,\nwe settle a conjecture concerning the worst possible subdiffusive decay in four dimensions.\n\n1. I NTRODUCTION\n1.1 Motivation.\nRandom walks among random conductances (a.k.a. the Random Conductance Model) are among\nthe best studied examples of random walks in random environments. Indeed, it was in this context\nwhere the first general cases of an (annealed) invariance principle were established (Kipnis and\nVaradhan [21]) and the decay of transition probabilities characterized (Delmotte [16]). Recently,\nthe model enjoyed another wave of concerted work whose motivation stemmed from several\nsources. First, the invariance principle - for elliptic cases [21] or not (De Masi, Ferrari, Goldstein and Wick [18, 19]) - required averaging the path law over the environment; the desire was\nto remove this averaging and prove a quenched version of the result. Second, the analytic methods employed in [16] hinged upon the assumption of uniform ellipticity and it was unclear how\nto proceed in the absence thereof.\nAs it turns out, both problems were resolved roughly at the same time and using similar methods (Sidoravicius and Sznitman [26], Berger and Biskup [6], Mathieu and Piatnitski [23]). A key\ninput was to invoke (and obtain) a diffusive bound on the probability that the random walk is\nback to the starting point after a long time. This could be done in various specific cases of interest\n(e.g., for elliptic conductances by Delmotte [16]) including the random walk on the supercritical\npercolation cluster (Mathieu and Remy [24], Barlow [2]). However, instances of the Random\nConductance Model have also been found - in dimensions d \u2265 5 by Berger, Biskup, Hoffman\nand Kozma [7], Boukhadra [11, 12] and in d = 4 by Biskup and Boukhadra [9] - where this\nprobability decays subdiffusively. Remarkably, this happens while a non-degenerate invariance\nprinciple holds for the paths (Mathieu [22], Biskup and Prescott [10]). The two popular characterizations of \"diffusive behavior\" of the random walk employed in physics - one based on\nc 2012 M. Biskup, O. Louidor, A. Rozinov and A. Vandenberg-Rodes. Reproduction, by any means, of the\nentire article for non-commercial purposes is permitted without charge.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nM. BISKUP, O. LOUIDOR, A. ROZINOV AND A. VANDENBERG-RODES\n\nthe mean-square displacement of the n-th step of the walk and the other relying on the decay\nexponent of the return probabilities - thus yield conflicting conclusions.\nIn the present note we will further elucidate the above phenomenon by analyzing the typical\nbehavior of the random walk path conditioned to return to the starting point at a given time. Our\nmain finding is that, whenever the return probabilities decay subdiffusively, the trapping strategies employed in [7, 9, 11, 12] - explicitly, that the walk gets stuck in a very small region for a\npositive fraction of its time - are actually dominant. This may seem akin to the behavior seen\nin the Random Conductance Model with non-integrable upper tails; the limiting behavior there is\ndescribed by the fractional kinetic equation which corresponds to a Brownian path parametrized\nby the inverse of a stochastic (subordinator) process (Barlow and \u010cern\u00fd [3], \u010cern\u00fd [15]). However, in our case the trapping occurs at a bounded number of \"space-time\" locations, while for\nthe fractional kinetic model it occurs at multiple scales and along the entire path.\n1.2 Model and known facts.\nIn order to keep further discussion more focused, let us introduce some notation. The random\nwalks we will consider invariably take place on the hypercubic lattice Zd . Only nearest-neighbor\ntransitions will be permitted with their probabilities given as follows: Let (\u03c9xy ) be the collection\nof positive numbers, called conductances, that are indexed by unordered pairs of nearest neighbor\nvertices; i.e., \u03c9xy = \u03c9yx . The \"walk\" is actually a Markov chain (Xn ) with transition kernel\n\u03c9xy\n(1.1)\nwhere \u03c0\u03c9 (x) := \u2211 \u03c9xz .\nP\u03c9 (x, y) :=\n\u03c0\u03c9 (x)\nz : |z\u2212x|=1\n\nWe will henceforth assume that the \u03c9 's are i.i.d. random variables with common law denoted\nby P and expectation by E. We will assume that the conductances are bounded from above, say,\nP(\u03c9xy \u2264 1) = 1, but not away from zero. Notwithstanding, we impose P(\u03c9xy = 0) := 0 throughout\nthe paper to keep (many) calculations at a comfortable level.\nLet us use P\u03c9x to denote the law of the path (Xn ) subject to the initial condition P\u03c9x (X0 = x) = 1.\nClearly, P\u03c9x (Xn = y) can also be written as the n-fold product Pn\u03c9 (x, y) of the transition kernel\nevaluated between x and y. Central to our attention is the precise decay of the diagonal term,\nP\u03c92n (0, 0), as n \u2192 \u221e. A quenched invariance principle is valid in our setting (Mathieu [22], Biskup\nand Prescott [10]) and one thus immediately has the lower bound\nC(\u03c9 )\n,\nn \u2265 1,\n(1.2)\nnd/2\nfor some P-a.s. positive C(\u03c9 ); see e.g. Lemma 5.1 in Biskup [8]. This rules out a superdiffusive\nscaling and, naturally, leads one to bet on a diffusive behavior. However, attempts to prove a\ncorresponding upper bound failed due to the fact that all methods known for this purpose require\nsome level of uniform ellipticity (which is simply not there for the cases under consideration).\nAs it turned out, these efforts had no chance of succeeding - such upper bounds actually do not\nhold despite the non-degenerate diffusive scaling of the entire path.\nIt was Fontes and Mathieu [20] who first raised doubts about the general validity of diffusive\nheat-kernel upper bounds by constructing a law on conductances (not exactly i.i.d., but close\n2n (0, 0) decays arbitrarily slowly. However, as\nenough), in all d \u2265 1, for which the expectation EP\u03c9\nwe are dealing with tail probabilities, it was not clear how much of this is the effect of averaging.\nMotivated by this, Berger, Biskup, Hoffman and Kozma [7] turned to the study of the quenched\ndecay. It is not hard to check that, in d = 1, the decay can be arbitrarily slow, so the best general\n\nP2n\n\u03c9 (0, 0) \u2265\n\n\fTRAPPING IN THE RANDOM CONDUCTANCE MODEL\n\n3\n\n2n (0, 0) = o(1). Above one dimension, the following\nestimate one can hope for is, in this case, P\u03c9\ngeneral upper bounds were obtained:\n\uf8f1\n\u2212d/2 ,\n\uf8f4\nd = 2, 3,\n\uf8f2n\nn\n\u22122\n(1.3)\nP\u03c9 (0, 0) \u2264 C(\u03c9 ) n log n,\nd = 4,\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3 \u22122\nn ,\nd \u2265 5,\n\nwhere C(\u03c9 ) < \u221e P-a.s. This matches the lower bound (1.2) in dimensions d = 2, 3 (and thus\nshows that averaging was the culprit in this case) but leaves a gap in all d \u2265 4.\nThis point appeared to be a good time to start searching for possible counterexamples. And, indeed, soon enough an (i.i.d., nearest-neighbor) environment P was constructed, for any sequence\n\u03bbn \u2192 \u221e and any d \u2265 2, such that\nC(\u03c9 )\n,\n(1.4)\nP2n\n\u03c9 (0, 0) \u2265 2\nn \u03bbn\nalong a deterministic subsequence nk \u2192 \u221e; cf [7, Theorem 9]. Note that this decays faster than\nn\u2212d/2 in d = 2, 3 but slower in d \u2265 5. Hence (1.3) seemed to be right on target (at least for d 6= 4\nbut, as we will show here, also for d = 4).\nThe gist of the construction of such an environment is simple to describe: For a positive integer n, call an edge hx, yi a trap of scale n if \u03c9xy = 1 and \u03c9xz = 1/n for all neighbors z 6= y\nof x, and similarly \u03c9yz = 1/n for all neighbors z 6= x of y. Call a trap \u03bbn -accessible if there is a\npath of length o(log \u03bbn ) of edges with conductance one that connects a neighbor of x or y to a\nfixed (\u03c9 -dependent) neighborhood of the origin. Now construct P so that a typical configuration\nwill contain a \u03bbn -accessible trap of scale n for all sufficiently large n in a (sparse) deterministic\nsequence tending to infinity.\nThe bound (1.4) is then the result of the following strategy: The walk finds the path of conductance one in a finite number of steps and then travels along it towards the trap. Then it jumps\nacross a 1/n-edge into the trap - paying order 1/n in probability - after which it is happy to keep\nbouncing back and forth on hx, yi for any given time of order n (note that the escape probability\nis order 1/n). Then we make it emerge from the trap by crossing the same 1/n-edge (paying again\norder 1/n) just in time for it to make it back, backtracking its own steps, to the origin in total\ntime 2n. Using the Markov property, this gives\n\u2212o(log \u03bbn ) 1 \u2212O(1) 1 \u2212o(log \u03bbn )\ne\ne\n,\n(1.5)\nP2n\n\u03c9 (0, 0) \u2265 C(\u03c9 ) e\nn\nn\nwhich easily yields (1.4). A more detailed analysis (Boukhadra [11,12]) reveals that the transition\nbetween diffusive and subdiffusive regimes occurs in the class of power-law tails.\nAs can be expected, in d = 4 the corresponding construction becomes considerably more difficult, but even here one can find P, for any \u03bbn \u2192 \u221e, such that\n\nlog n\n,\n(1.6)\nn2 \u03bbn\nalong a deterministic sequence of n's tending to infinity. The appearance of log n is due to the fact\nthat here trapping occurs (roughly) uniformly likely along a sequence of exponentially growing\nspatial scales; cf Biskup and Boukhadra [9] for further details.\nWe remark that subdiffusive decay of return probabilities has recently been demonstrated also\nin dynamical random environments by Buckley [13]. Interestingly, the variable nature of the\nenvironment permits one to achieve even decays close to n\u22121 . This is (roughly) because one can\n\nP2n\n\u03c9 (0, 0) \u2265 C(\u03c9 )\n\n\f4\n\nM. BISKUP, O. LOUIDOR, A. ROZINOV AND A. VANDENBERG-RODES\n\narrange the environment so that the walk has to pay to enter the trap, but exits it freely. It is not\nclear whether the n\u22121 -decay is the worst one can get under reasonable mixing assumptions on the\nenvironment dynamics.\nAs a final note we wish to reiterate that all of the subdiffusive decays occur while the quenched\ninvariance principle holds for the path law. Thanks to very interesting observations made by\nDelmotte and Rau [17], also other characteristics of the law (e.g., the expected time to exit a large\nball) behave as for uniformly elliptic environments.\n1.3 Problems to be addressed here.\nAlthough the lower bounds (1.4) and (1.6) and the upper bounds (1.3) are quite similar, they do\nnot match each other completely because of the requirement \u03bbn \u2192 \u221e. In d \u2265 5 this gap is closed\nby another result from [7] which states\nin d \u2265 5 :\n\nn2 P2n\n\u03c9 (0, 0) \u2212\u2192 0,\nn\u2192\u221e\n\nP-a.s.\n\n(1.7)\n\nUnfortunately, the argument in [7] does not extend to d = 4 and so, even in the presence of\nexamples satisfying the lower bound (1.6), the story is not entirely finished in d = 4. This is one\nof the problems to be resolved in this note (Theorem 2.2).\nAnother question of interest concerns the behavior of the paths that carry P\u03c90 (X2n = 0). For\n\"regularly behaved\" random walks we expect, somewhat tautologically, that the path scales,\nas n \u2192 \u221e, to a Brownian bridge. However, once P2n (0, 0) decays subdiffusively, this can no\nlonger be true. The fact that the lower bounds and the upper bounds can be matched suggests a\npossibility of a path getting stuck for a time of order n at a particular (spatially small) location\n- a trap. However, it was not known whether multiple (more than a few) visits to traps or some\nother strategies cannot do even better. The main contribution in this paper (Theorems 2.3 and 2.4)\nis an answer to this question, namely a rather precise description of the typical trapping strategy\nemployed by the random walk in order to achieve subdiffusivity.\n2. A SSUMPTIONS\n\nAND\n\nR ESULTS\n\nAlthough we treat here only the case of i.i.d. conductances, there are in fact only a few specific\nfacts about the environment that we use in the proofs. These may be satisfied by other conductance laws and for this reason we explicitly state in this section all the assumptions which we\nrely upon later. Additional examples of environment distributions for which our results hold are\ndiscussed after the statement of the main results.\n2.1 Setup and assumptions.\nLet B(Zd ) denote the set of unordered (nearest-neighbor) edges in Zd and let \u03a9 := (0, 1]B(Z ) be\nthe set of allowed conductance configurations. We endow \u03a9 with the usual product \u03c3 -algebra.\nWe will write hx, yi for the edge with endpoints x, y \u2208 Zd ; since the edges are not oriented, we\nhave hx, yi = hy, xi. In particular, if \u03c9 \u2208 \u03a9, we can interchangeably write\nd\n\n\u03c9xy = \u03c9yx = \u03c9b ,\n\nwhere\n\nb := hx, yi \u2208 B(Zd ).\n\n(2.1)\n\nOn \u03a9, there is a natural notion of a \"shift-by x,\" denoted by \u03c4x , which is defined by\n(\u03c4x \u03c9 )y,z := \u03c9y+x,z+x ,\n\nx, y, z \u2208 Zd .\n\n(2.2)\n\n\fTRAPPING IN THE RANDOM CONDUCTANCE MODEL\n\n5\n\nNotice that the origin in environment \u03c4x \u03c9 corresponds to vertex x in environment \u03c9 . Our first\nassumption pertains directly to the law of \u03c9 :\nAssumption A1 The environment law P is a probability measure on (the product \u03c3 -algebra\nof) \u03a9 which is (jointly) ergodic with respect to the shifts (\u03c4x )x\u2208Zd .\nThe relevance of the ergodicity assumption is seen from the fact that, for any sequence an \u2192 \u221e\nand \u22c6 \u2208 {0, \u221e}, the events\n\b\n2n\n(0, 0) = \u22c6\n(2.3)\nA\u22c6+ := \u03c9 : lim sup an P\u03c9\nn\u2192\u221e\n\nand\n\n\b\n2n\nA\u22c6\u2212 := \u03c9 : lim inf an P\u03c9\n(0, 0) = \u22c6\nn\u2192\u221e\n\n(2.4)\n\nare shift-invariant and thus zero-one for any ergodic P. To see why shift-invariance holds, we\nrecall that the diagonal heat-kernel is non-increasing; cf [7, Lemma 3.9]:\n2n+2\n(x, x),\nP2n\n\u03c9 (x, x) \u2265 P\u03c9\n\nn \u2265 0.\n\n(2.5)\n\n2n+2 (x, x) \u2265 C(\u03c9 )P2n (y, y), whenever x and y are neighbors on Zd , with\nThis implies P2n\n\u03c9 (x, x) \u2265 P\u03c9\n\u03c9\n(x,\nx)\n=\nP2n\nC(\u03c9 ) := P\u03c9 (x, y)P\u03c9 (y, x) > 0. As P2n\n\u03c9\n\u03c4x \u03c9 (0, 0), we are done.\nOur results and their proofs require making a (somewhat arbitrary) distinction between strong\nand weak edges. This will be done by introducing a positive cut-off \u03b1 and calling edges b with\n\u03c9b \u2265 \u03b1 strong and the others weak. If (as in the i.i.d. case), for \u03b1 > 0 small enough, the strong\nedges form an infinite connected component - the strong component C\u221e,\u03b1 - whose complement has only finite connected components, we may choose to observe the random walk only\nwhen it is on C\u221e,\u03b1 . This defines a coarse-grained random walk X\u0302. This walk is again a Markov\nchain, but now with the states restricted to C\u221e,\u03b1 . The benefits of considering the coarse-graining\nare twofold: First, we will be able to employ arguments which require the conductances to be\nbounded uniformly away from zero. Second, the coarse-grained setting provides a natural, and\ncompletely geometric, approach to the notion of trapping.\nLet us thus pick an \u03b1 > 0 and let B\u03b1 (\u03c9 ) := {b \u2208 B(Zd ) : \u03c9b \u2265 \u03b1 }. Let C\u221e,\u03b1 = C\u221e,\u03b1 (\u03c9 ) denote\nthe set of vertices in Zd that lie on an infinite self-avoiding path of edges from B\u03b1 (\u03c9 ). We will\noften regard C\u221e,\u03b1 as a sub-graph of Zd with the edge set {hx, yi \u2208 B\u03b1 (\u03c9 ) : x, y \u2208 C\u221e,\u03b1 }. Our first\nstructural assumption is then:\n\nAssumption A2 For P-a.e. \u03c9 ,\n[\n\nC\u221e,\u03b1 (\u03c9 ) = Zd .\n\n(2.6)\n\n\u03b1 >0\n\nNotice that Assumption A2 implies\n\b\n\u03b11 := inf \u03b1 > 0 : P(C\u221e,\u03b1 \u220b 0) = 0 > 0.\n\n(2.7)\n\nFor \u03b1 \u2208 (0, \u03b11 ), we may thus define the conditional measure\n\nP\u03b1 (\u2212) := P(\u2212|0 \u2208 C\u221e,\u03b1 ).\n\n(2.8)\n\nWe remark that, for general environments, the graph C\u221e,\u03b1 may not be connected and, in fact,\nuniqueness of the infinite cluster of strong edges is not required. Notwithstanding, uniqueness\ncertainly holds in the i.i.d. case (e.g., by Burton and Keane [14]).\n\n\f6\n\nM. BISKUP, O. LOUIDOR, A. ROZINOV AND A. VANDENBERG-RODES\n\nOur next concern are the connected components of the set Zd \\ C\u221e,\u03b1 - with connectedness\ninduced by the graph structure of the full Zd . For y \u2208 Zd \\ C\u221e,\u03b1 , let Fy = Fy (\u03c9 ) denote the\nconnected component of Zd \\ C\u221e,\u03b1 (\u03c9 ) containing y; for y \u2208 C\u221e,\u03b1 we set Fy := {y}. Define\nGx = Gx (\u03c9 ) by\n[\nGx :=\nFy .\n(2.9)\ny: hx,yi\u2208B(Zd )\n\nWe will use |Gx | to denote the cardinality of Gx .\n\nAssumption A3 There is \u03b1 \u2208 (0, \u03b11 ) such that\n|G0 | \u2208 L p (P\u03b1 ),\n\n\u2200 1 \u2264 p < \u221e.\n\n(2.10)\n\nNote that (2.10) implies that max|x|\u2264n |Gx | = no(1) as n \u2192 \u221e, P-a.s. Also, it is not hard to check\nthat, as \u03b1 decreases, C\u221e,\u03b1 (\u03c9 ) increases and G0 (\u03c9 ) decreases. Therefore, (2.10) is a monotone\n(in \u03b1 ) property and we accordingly define\n\b\n(2.11)\n\u03b12 := sup \u03b1 \u2208 (0, \u03b11 ) : (2.10) holds} .\n\nFor the discussion to come next, let \u03c9 \u2208 \u03a9 be such that Zd \\ C\u221e,\u03b1 (\u03c9 ) has only finite components. We will now define the aforementioned coarse-grained walk X\u0302. First we record the times\nthat the walk X spends away from C\u221e,\u03b1 . Let us set T0 := 0 and define\n\b\nk \u2265 0.\n(2.12)\nTk+1 := inf n > T0 + * * * + Tk : Xn \u2208 C\u221e,\u03b1 \u2212 (T0 + * * * + Tk ),\n\nThe quantity Tk - which is finite P\u03c9x -a.s. for all x and all k \u2265 1 - is the time between the (k \u22121)-st\nand k-th visit to C\u221e,\u03b1 . These visits occur at the locations\nX\u0302l := XT0 +***+Tl ,\n\nl \u2265 0.\n\n(2.13)\n\nThe sequence (X\u0302l ) is a Markov chain on C\u221e,\u03b1 whose transition kernel is given by\n\nP\u0302\u03c9 (x, y) := P\u03c9x (XT1 = y).\n\n(2.14)\n\nIt is easy to verify that both P\u03c9 and P\u0302\u03c9 are reversible with respect to the measure \u03c0\u03c9 (on Zd\nn the n-fold product of P\u0302 , define\nand C\u221e,\u03b1 respectively). Denoting by P\u0302\u03c9\n\u03c9\n\b\nn\n(x, y) > 0 ,\nx, y \u2208 C\u221e,\u03b1 ,\n(2.15)\nd\u03c9 (x, y) := inf n \u2265 0 : P\u0302\u03c9\nto be the Markov distance (metric) on C\u221e,\u03b1 . As our final assumption, we postulate a uniform\ndiffusive upper bound on the n-step transition probability of the coarse-grained walk.\n\nAssumption A4 There is \u03b10 \u2208 (0, \u03b12 ] such that for each \u03b1 \u2208 (0, \u03b10 ) and each \u03c1 > 0, there is a\nP\u03b1 -a.s. finite random variable C = C(\u03c9 ) such that for P\u03b1 -a.e. \u03c9 ,\nmax\n\nn\nsup P\u0302\u03c9\n(x, y) \u2264\n\nx\u2208C\u221e,\u03b1\ny\u2208C\u221e,\u03b1\nd\u03c9 (0,x)\u2264\u03c1 n\n\nC(\u03c9 )\n,\nnd/2\n\nn \u2265 1.\n\n(2.16)\n\nBy reversibility, (2.16) holds also with P\u0302n\u03c9 (y, x) instead of P\u0302n\u03c9 (x, y) with a constant C\u2032 (\u03c9 ) \u2264\n(2d/\u03b1 )C(\u03c9 ). The following proposition formally ensures that under the product law all above\nassumptions are satisfied.\nProposition 2.1 Any product law on \u03a9 obeys Assumptions A1-A4.\n\n\fTRAPPING IN THE RANDOM CONDUCTANCE MODEL\n\n7\n\nProof. The proof is essentially contained in [7, 10] - only minor modifications are required.\nIndeed, A1 holds as P is clearly ergodic. A2 follows since C\u221e,\u03b1 6= 0/ for P-a.s. once \u03b1 > 0 is such\nthat p := P(\u03c9b \u2265 \u03b1 ) > pc (d), where pc (d) is the Bernoulli bond percolation threshold on Zd .\n(We are also using that all conductances are positive.) A3 is covered by Proposition 2.3 of [10].\nA4 for \u03c1 = 1 follows by combining (6.10) in Proposition 6.1 of [10] and Lemma 3.4 in [7]. (As\ndecreasing \u03b1 permits us to increase p arbitrarily close to one, the isoperimetric inequality for\nlarge sets is proved by the argument from Benjamini and Mossel [5, Section 2.4].) The extension\nto general \u03c1 > 0, requires only that we consider boxes of side length (\u03c1 + 1)n instead of 2n\nin Proposition 6.1. This can be achieved by a slight reduction of exponent \u03bd in formula (6.5)\nof [10]; Lemma 3.4 in [7] then can be used as is. (We note that the control of isoperimetric\nvolumes provided by [7, Proposition A.2] or Benjamini-Mossel's argument in fact yields (2.16)\nd\nwith \u03c1 n replaced by a quantity that grows exponentially with n\u03bd d\u22121 .)\n\u0003\nIt is worthy a note that Assumptions A1-A4 are sufficient to ensure a quenched invariance\nprinciple for the corresponding random walk. This follows from Biskup and Prescott [10].\n2.2 Results.\nWe are now ready to state our main results. Our first task will be to close the gap between the\nupper bound in (1.3) for d = 4 and the lower bound in (1.6):\nTheorem 2.2 Let d = 4. Then under Assumptions A1-A4, for P-a.e. \u03c9 ,\n\u22122\nP2n\n\u03c9 (0, 0) = o(n log n),\n\nn \u2192 \u221e.\n\n(2.17)\n\nThis settles an open question that was left unanswered in [7] and [9]. As we will see in\nSection 3, the argument seamlessly yields also the proof of (1.7).\nThe next set of results concerns trapping effects. As already mentioned, we will describe these\nby means of the times T j the walk X takes between successive visits to C\u221e,\u03b1 . Define\nn\nln := inf m \u2265 1 :\n\nm\n\no\nT\n\u2265\n2n\n,\n\u2211 k\n\nk=1\n\nand for 1 \u2264 r \u2264 l and any \u03b8 \u2265 1, consider the sets\n(\nG l,r (\u03b8 ) :=\n\n(t1 , . . . ,tl ) \u2208 Nl :\n\nmin\n\nn \u2265 1,\n\n\u2211\n\n1\u2264i1 <***<ir \u2264l k=1,...,l\nk6\u2208{i1 ,...,ir }\n\n(2.18)\n\n)\n\ntk \u2264 \u03b8 .\n\n(2.19)\n\nUse these to define the event\n\b\n(r)\nE\u03c9 ,\u03b1 (\u03b8 , n) := r \u2264 ln \u2264 \u03b8 , (T1 , . . . , Tln ) \u2208 G ln ,r (\u03b8 ) .\n\n(2.20)\n\nwhich, we note, depends explicitly on \u03c9 and \u03b1 . This definition will be made clear once we state\nour first trapping result:\nTheorem 2.3 Let d \u2265 4 and suppose that Assumptions A1-A4 hold. Set r := \u230a d2 \u2212 1\u230b and define\n\n\u03bbn (\u03c9 ) := nd/2 P\u03c92n (0, 0)\n\n(2.21)\n\n\f8\n\nM. BISKUP, O. LOUIDOR, A. ROZINOV AND A.

If \u03b8 = o(n), the pigeon-hole principle\nensures that at least one of these components traps the walk for a time of order n.\n\nOur final theorem addresses one of the deficiencies of Theorem 2.3; namely, the fact that the\nconclusion concerns n\u22c6 instead of n:\nTheorem 2.4 Let d \u2265 4 and suppose that Assumptions A1-A4 hold. Set r := \u230a d2 \u2212 1\u230b and define\n\uf8f1\nn2\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\u221a\nif d = 4,\nP2n (0, 0),\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2 log n \u03c9\n\u03b6n (\u03c9 ) := n(d/4+1) P2n (0, 0),\n(2.23)\nif 5 \u2264 d \u2264 8,\n\uf8f4\n\u03c9\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3 3 2n\nn P\u03c9 (0, 0),\nif d \u2265 9.\n\nThen, for all \u03b1 \u2208 (0, \u03b10 ), there is a P\u03b1 -a.s. finite C = C(\u03c9 ) such that for all n \u2265 1 and all \u03b8 with\n1 \u2264 \u03b8 \u2264 n,\n\uf8f1p\n\uf8f4\nlog(n/\u03b8 ),\nif d = 4,\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\u0010\n\u0011(d/4\u22121)\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\nn\n\u0001\nC(\u03c9 )\n(r)\n,\nif 5 \u2264 d \u2264 8,\nP\u03c90 E\u03c9 ,\u03b1 (\u03b8 , n) X2n = 0 \u2265 1 \u2212\n(2.24)\n\u03b8\n\u03b6n (\u03c9 ) \uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4 n\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3 d\n+ 1,\nif d \u2265 9.\n\u03b8 /4\u22121\nAs before, once \u03b6n \u2192 \u221e along a subsequence of n's, we can choose \u03b8 = o(n) so that the righthand side tends to one (along the subsequence). Note that this will be possible when the decay of\nP\u03c92n (0, 0) is sufficiently slower than n\u2212d/2 .\n\nA second deficiency of Theorem 2.3 is the inability to exclude the possibility of multiple\ntrapping locations. This is only an issue in d \u2265 6 because r = 1 for d = 4, 5. Unfortunately, we\ndo not know how to overcome this even for a strongly subdiffusive decay.\n2.3 Discussion.\nWe will finish with a couple of remarks on the scope and extensions of the above results. First,\nboth Theorem 2.3 and 2.4 admit a slightly stronger formulation. Namely, one can get (2.22) and\n(2.24) for P-a.e. \u03c9 and all \u03b1 \u2208 (0, \u03b10 ) provided the constant C(\u03c9 ) retains an explicit dependence\n(r)\non \u03b1 . We emphasize that this does not follow automatically from the above as E\u03c9 ,\u03b1 (\u03b8 , n) depends\n\n\fTRAPPING IN THE RANDOM CONDUCTANCE MODEL\n\n9\n\nexplicitly on \u03b1 . To control the continuum of possible \u03b1 's, we use that, for P-a.e. \u03c9 ,\n0 < \u03b1 \u2264 \u03b1 \u2032 \u2264 \u03b10\n\n\u21d2\n\n(r)\n\n(r)\n\nE\u03c9 ,\u03b1 (\u03b8 , n) \u2286 E\u03c9 ,\u03b1 \u2032 (\u03b8 , n).\n\n(2.25)\n\nIn addition, as long as G0 (\u03c9 ) is finite - which happens for all \u03b1 \u2208 (0, \u03b10 ) P-a.s. - the conclusion\nis not affected by the fact that the walk does not start on the infinite component.\nAs to the need for a choice of n\u22c6 in Theorem 2.3, we point out that the proof actually tells us\nmore. Indeed, writing the right-hand side of (2.22) as 1 \u2212 qn , from (4.17) we have\nn\no 1\n\u0001\n(r)\n# m \u2208 {n \u2212 \u03b8 , . . . , n} : P\u03c90 E\u03c9 ,\u03b1 (\u03b8 , m) X2m = 0 \u2264 1 \u2212 \u03b5 \u2264 qn (\u03b8 + 1)\n(2.26)\n\u03b5\nfor any fixed \u03b5 > 0. Hence, as soon as the error probability qn tends to zero, trapping occurs at\n\u221a\nall but an o(1)-fraction of times in {n \u2212 \u03b8 , . . . , n} (just choose \u03b5 := qn ). We, in fact, believe the\nfollowing:\nConjecture 2.5 There is P\u03b1 -a.s. finite C = C(\u03c9 ) such that, for all \u03b8 sufficiently close to n, the\nbound (2.22) holds also for n\u22c6 = n.\nIdeas invoked in the proof of Theorem 2.4 may be handy here as they establish an explicit bound\n(r)\non how fast the quantity P\u03c90 (E\u03c9 ,\u03b1 (\u03b8 , m) X2m = 0) may oscillate with m.\nAnother note we wish to make concerns the geometric size of the trapped regions. From\nAssumption A3 we know that the largest component of Zd \\ C\u221e,\u03b1 that the walk can reach (and\nthus become trapped by) in time of order n is at most no(1) in diameter. However, the strategies\nemployed for the proofs of the lower bounds indicate that a typical trapping region may be of\nfinite order in size, regardless of n. It is an open question to prove or disprove this rigorously (for\ni.i.d. environments, to begin with).\nFinally, we wish to remark that all our results extend to more general environment distributions.\nFirst, one may consider any ergodic distribution on \u03a9 which stochastically dominates a product\nlaw; indeed, Assumptions A1-A4 still hold in this case. (This is obvious for A2-A3; for A4 one\nneeds to note that the Benjamini-Mossel [5, Section 2.4] argument for the isoperimetric inequality on percolation cluster for p close to one extends to any law that dominates this percolation\nmeasure.) Second, for i.i.d. conductances, we may soften the requirement that the conductances\nbe strictly positive. In this case, we can no longer impose (2.6) as Assumption A2 and we must\ninstead require (2.7) directly. The rest of the assumptions as well as the proofs remain almost the\nsame, except that instead of Zd we need to use the (random) set of edges with positive conductances as the effective underlying graph. With this generalization, the results apply to any product\nlaw for which P(\u03c9b > 0) > pc (d), where pc (d) is the bond-percolation threshold on Zd .\n3. D ECAY\n\nIN FOUR DIMENSIONS\n\nIn this section we prove Theorem 2.2. Although our exposition below is by and large selfcontained, we welcome the reader to check Section 3.3 and Proposition 3.5 in [7] which serves\nas a foundation for the present proof. A key technical step underlying all derivations in [7] is\nthe conditioning on the number of steps taken by the coarse-grained walk.

Reversibility then implies that the second sum has the same\nbound as the first one.\nNext we need a version of Proposition 3.5 from [7] with an explicit term on the right:\nLemma 3.1 There exists a P\u03b1 -a.s. finite random variable C(\u03c9 ) such that\n\u0011\n\u0011\n\u0010\nl\u2212d/2 0 \u0010\nT\n\u2265\nn\n.\nE\u03c9\nT\n;\nP\u03c90 X\u0302l = 0, \u2211 Ti \u2265 n \u2264 C(\u03c9 )\ni\ni\n\u2211\n\u2211\nn\ni\u2264\u2308l/2\u2309\ni\u2264\u2308l/2\u2309\ni\u2264\u2308l/2\u2309\nProof. By conditioning on X\u0302\u2308l/2\u2309 we get\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u0010\nP\u03c90 X\u0302l = 0, \u2211 Ti \u2265 n = \u2211 P\u03c90 X\u0302\u2308l/2\u2309 = x,\ni\u2264\u2308l/2\u2309\n\nx\u2208C\u221e,\u03b1\n\n\u2211\n\ni\u2264\u2308l/2\u2309\n\n\u0011\nTi \u2265 n P\u0302l\u2212\u2308l/2\u2309 (x, 0).\n\n(3.3)\n\n(3.4)\n\nReversibility and Assumption A4 then tell us that\n\nP\u0302l\u2212\u2308l/2\u2309 (x, 0) =\n\n2d\n\u03c0\u03c9 (0) l\u2212\u2308l/2\u2309\nP\u0302\n(0, x) \u2264 l\u2212d/2 ,\n\u03c0\u03c9 (x)\n\u03b1\n\n(3.5)\n\nuniformly for all x. The desired bound then follows by summation over x and an application of\nChebyshev's inequality.\n\u0003\nFor what follows, we need to recall the notion of the \"point of the view of the particle\". Given\n\u03c9 and a sample X of the random walk, the sequence (\u03c4Xn \u03c9 ) represents the environments seen\nfrom the position of the random walk. As it turns out, this is a Markov chain on \u03a9 with a\nreversible, stationary measure\n1\n\u03c0\u03c9 (0)P(\u2212), where Z := E\u03c0\u03c9 (0).\n(3.6)\nZ\nAs is well known (see, e.g., [8, Section 2.1]) the chain started from this measure is ergodic.\nA similar construction can be carried through also for the chain (X\u0302 , T ). The stationary distribution for the sequence (\u03c4X\u0302n \u03c9 ) is now given by\nQ(\u2212) :=\n\nQ\u03b1 (\u2212) := Q(\u2212|0 \u2208 C\u221e,\u03b1 ).\n\n(3.7)\n\nwhich is again stationary and reversible. Interpreting the chain using an induced shift on the\nspace of trajectories (see, e.g., [6, Lemma 3.3]), starting from Q\u03b1 , the process (\u03c4X\u0302n \u03c9 , Tn )n\u22651 is\nstationary and ergodic. In addition Q\u03b1 \u223c P\u03b1 , i.e., Q\u03b1 is equivalent to P\u03b1 , for every \u03b1 \u2208 (0, \u03b10 ).\n\n\fTRAPPING IN THE RANDOM CONDUCTANCE MODEL\n\n11\n\nLemma 3.2 Abbreviate\n1\nl\n\nl\n\n\u2211 Tj ,\n\nl \u2265 1.\n\n(3.8)\n\nZl \u2212\u2192 Z\u221e := EQ\u03b1 E\u03c90 T1 ,\n\n(3.9)\n\nZl :=\n\nj=1\n\nThen for P\u03b1 -almost every \u03c9 we have\nl\u2192\u221e\n\nP\u03c90 -almost surely and in L1 (P\u03c90 ).\nProof. We shall prove the almost-sure and L1 convergence in (3.9) for Q\u03b1 -almost every \u03c9 . Since\nQ\u03b1 \u223c P\u03b1 , this will be enough. Consider therefore the joint stationary measure \u03bc := Q\u03b1 \u2297 P\u03c90 on\nthe space of environments and paths of the random walk. By [7, Lemma 3.8] we have\nE\u03c9x T1 \u2264 c1 |Gx |,\n\nx \u2208 C\u221e,\u03b1 (\u03c9 ),\n\n(3.10)\n\nP\u03b1 -a.s.\n\n(3.11)\n\nfor some c1 = c1 (d, \u03b1 ) \u2208 (0, \u221e). In particular, EQ\u03b1 E\u03c90 T1 < \u221e because the component sizes have all\nmoments by Assumption A3. The ergodicity of the Markov chain on the space of environments\nthen tell us that Zl \u2192 Z\u221e , \u03bc -a.s. and in L1 (\u03bc ). However, this is not enough to prove convergence\nin L1 (P\u03c90 ) because almost sure and L1 convergence do not generally guarantee convergence of\nconditional expectations.\nWe thus proceed by a more explicit argument. Since Zl \u2192 Z\u221e almost surely with respect to \u03bc ,\nand thus also with respect to P\u03c90 , for P\u03b1 -a.e. \u03c9 , in order to infer L1 (P\u03c90 )-convergence, it suffices\nto show the convergence of the norms, i.e.,\nE\u03c90 Zl \u2212\u2192 Z\u221e ,\nl\u2192\u221e\n\nBy the Markov property and additivity of expectations, this is equivalent to proving this for the\ncorresponding expectation of the sequence of random variables\nYl :=\n\n1 l\u22121 0\nE\u03c4X\u0302 \u03c9 (T1 ).\nj\nl\u2211\nj=0\n\n(3.12)\n\nIndeed, E\u03c90 Zl = E\u03c90 Yl for each l \u2265 1 and Yl \u2192 Z\u221e , \u03bc -a.s.\nWe will show E\u03c90 Yl \u2192 Z\u221e by invoking the Dominated Convergence Theorem, but for that end\nwe need to exhibit a dominating random variable that lies in L1 (P\u03c90 ), for P\u03b1 -a.e. \u03c9 . Define\nWl :=\n\n1 l\u22121\n|GX\u0302 j |,\nl\u2211\nj=0\n\nl \u2265 1,\n\n(3.13)\n\nand set\nW \u22c6 := sup Wl .\n\n(3.14)\n\nl\u22651\n\nFrom (3.10) we observe that (0 \u2264)Yl \u2264 c1Wl \u2264 c1W \u22c6 and so W \u22c6 can indeed be used to dominate\nthe Yl 's. We thus need to prove\nL p (\u03bc )\n\nW \u22c6 \u2208 L1 (P\u03c90 ),\n\nP\u03b1 -a.s.\n\n(3.15)\n\nBy Assumption A3, |G0 | \u2208\nfor all p \u2265 1. Wiener's Dominated Ergodic Theorem (cf Petersen [25, Theorem 1.16]) then implies W \u22c6 \u2208 L p (\u03bc ) for all p \u2265 1 as well. From here (3.15)\nfollows via Fubini's Theorem.\n\u0003\n\n\f12\n\nM. BISKUP, O. LOUIDOR, A. ROZINOV AND A. VANDENBERG-RODES\n\nRemark 3.3 In the above proof we used the following sequence of estimates:\n\u0011\n\u0011\n\u0010 l \u0011\n\u0010 l\u22121\n\u0010 l\u22121\nl \u2265 1,\nE\u03c90 \u2211 T j = E\u03c90 \u2211 E\u03c40X\u0302 \u03c9 (T1 ) \u2264 c1 E\u03c90 \u2211 |GX\u0302 j | \u2264 C(\u03c9 )l,\nj=1\n\nj=0\n\nj\n\n(3.16)\n\nj=0\n\nfor some P\u03b1 -a.s. finite random variable C = C(\u03c9 ). This bound was invoked in [7, Eq. (3.45)], but\nwithout a reference to the Dominated Ergodic Theorem for the proof of the last step. It appears\nthat one needs more than just plain integrability of |G0 | for the last inequality to hold.\nNow we are ready to establish the upper bound on the four-dimensional heat kernel:\nProof of Theorem 2.2. We now claim that, for any M > EQ\u03b1 E\u03c90 T1 ,\n\u0011\n1 0\u0010\nE\u03c9 \u2211 Ti ; \u2211 Ti \u2265 n = 0,\nlim max\nn\u2192\u221e 1\u2264l\u2264n/M l\ni\u2264l\ni\u2264l\nTo show this, use the bound n/l \u2265 M to derive\n\u0011\n\u0001\n1 0\u0010\nE\u03c9 \u2211 Ti ; \u2211 Ti \u2265 n = E\u03c90 Zl ; Zl \u2265 n/l\nl\ni\u2264l\ni\u2264l\n\u2264\n\nE\u03c90 |Zl \u2212 Z\u221e| + E\u03c90\n\nP-a.s.\n\n(3.17)\n\n(3.18)\n\u0001\nZ\u221e ; Zl \u2265 M .\n\nBy Lemma 3.2 and the choice of M both terms on the right tend to zero as l \u2192 \u221e, so given \u03b5 > 0\nwe can find l0 so that the left-hand side is less than \u03b5 for all l with l0 \u2264 l \u2264 n/M. But for l \u2264 l0\nthe limit of the left-hand side as n \u2192 \u221e is zero by the fact that the expectation of \u2211li=1 Ti is finite.\nIn order to prove the claim in the theorem, set M > EQ\u03b1 E\u03c90 T1 , recall (3.2) and split the last sum\nin this formula according to whether n/l > M or not. Fix \u03b5 > 0 and let n0 be so large that, for all\nn \u2265 n0 and all 1 \u2264 l \u2264 n/M, the expectation on the right of (3.3) is less than \u03b5 l (this is possible\nby (3.17)). For the complementary set of (n, l) pairs we use instead that\n\u0011\n\u0010\nT\n\u2265\nn\n\u2264 C(\u03c9 )l,\nT\n;\nE\u03c90\n(3.19)\n\u2211 i \u2211 i\ni\u2264\u2308l/2\u2309\n\ni\u2264\u2308l/2\u2309\n\nas is implied by (3.16). Putting this together, we get for n \u2265 n0 \u2228 Ml0 ,\n\u0012\nn/M 1\u2212d/2 \u0013\nl\nl1\u2212d/2\n4n\n\u22121\nP\u03c9 (0, 0) \u2264 C(\u03c9 )n\n+\u03b5 \u2211\n.\n\u2211\nn\nn\nl=1\nn/M\u2264l\u2264n\n\n(3.20)\n\nThe first term in the parentheses on the right is bounded by n\u22121 log M, once M is sufficiently\nlarge, while the second term is at most \u03b5 n\u22121 log n. As \u03b5 was arbitrarily small and as monotonicity\n(0, 0) as well, the claim follows.\n\u0003\nimplies that (3.20) holds for P4n+2\n\u03c9\nRemark 3.4 Note that in d \u2265 5, the first sum on the right-hand side of (3.20) is order M 2\u2212d/2 n\u22121\nwhile the second sum is order n\u22121 . This gives another proof of (1.7); this time allowing for an\nextension to d = 4.\n\n4. T RAPPING\n\nUNDER SUBDIFFUSIVE DECAY\n\nHere we will establish the trapping scenario as stated in Theorem 2.3. The main technical obstacle\nfor us is that Lemma 3.1 gives a good estimate for the sum over Ti exceeding n, rather than the\nevent that the sum is equal to n. This necessitates that in many calculations we sum over a\n\n\fTRAPPING IN THE RANDOM CONDUCTANCE MODEL\n\n13\n\nrange of n's which then invariably leads to results for an n\u22c6 in this range, rather than n itself. In\nwhat follows we will consider only d \u2265 4 and fix \u03b1 \u2208 (0, \u03b10 ), where \u03b10 is as in Assumption A4.\nConsequently, the statements and in particular the random constants C(\u03c9 ) in the expressions\nbelow depend on \u03b1 , but to avoid clutter, we shall not reflect this in the notation.\nOur starting point is the following observation: Should the walk spend a majority of its time\nin a small number of weak components, the total number of coarse-grained steps must satisfy\nln = o(n). A quantitative form of this is:\nProposition 4.1 There is a P\u03b1 -a.s. finite random variable C = C(\u03c9 ) such that for all n \u2265 1 and\nall \u03b8 and \u2206 with 1 \u2264 \u03b8 , \u2206 \u2264 n/2,\n\uf8f1\nn\n\u0010\n\u0011\nn\nif d = 4,\n\u0001\nC(\u03c9 ) n \uf8f2log( /\u03b8 ),\n1\n0\n\u03b8\n,\nX\n=\n0\n\u2264\nl\n\u2265\n(4.1)\nP\n2m\n\u2211\n\u03c9 m\n\u0001\nd\n\u2206 + 1 m=n\u2212\u2206\nnd/2 \u2206 \uf8f3 n /2\u22122 ,\nif d \u2265 5.\n\u03b8\n\nProof.

The claim now follows by summation over l.\n\u0003\nOur next task is to estimate the probability of the event that the collection of times (T1 , . . . , Tlm )\ndoes not have the property that removal of r of them makes the sum small. Explicitly:\nProposition 4.2 Suppose d \u2265 4 and r \u2265 \u230a d2 \u2212 1\u230b. Recall the definition of G l,r (\u03b8 ) from (2.19).\nFor P\u03b1 -a.e. \u03c9 there is C(\u03c9 ) < \u221e such that for all n \u2265 1 and all \u03b8 and \u2206 with 1 \u2264 \u2206, \u03b8 \u2264 n/2,\n\u0010\n\u0011 C(\u03c9 ) \u0010 n \u0011\u0010 n \u0011d/2\u22122\nn\n1\n0\nP\nl\n\u2264\n.

Indeed, only then\nthe sum will be dominated by the terms l \u2248 \u03b8 . (This is actually the reason why we need to\ntake r dependent on dimension.) A novel point compared to the previous proof is the condition\n(T1 , . . . , Tlm ) 6\u2208 G lm ,r (\u03b8 ). We will again convert the probability into expectation as follows: Let\nr \u2265 1 and l \u2265 r and consider the set of distinct r-tuples\n\b\n(4.5)\nI(r, l) := i = (i1 , . . . , ir ) : 1 \u2264 i1 < i2 < * * * < ir \u2264 l .\nThen\n\n(T1 , . . . , Tl ) 6\u2208 G l,r (\u03b8 ) &\n\nl\n\n\u2211 Ti \u2265 n\n\ni=1\n\nr+1\n\n\u21d2\n\n\u2211 \u220f Ti\n\nk\n\ni\u2208I(r+1,l) k=1\n\n\u2265\n\nn\u03b8 r\n.\n(r + 1)!\n\n(4.6)\n\nTo see why this holds, recall (2.19) to see that if (T1 , . . . , Tl ) 6\u2208 G l,r (\u03b8 ), then the sum of the Ti\nwith i skipping out any r-tuple of indices yields at least \u03b8 .

VANDENBERG-RODES\n\nas 1/(r + 1)! times the sum over r + 1 distinct indices and summing one index after the other, we\nthus get at least a factor \u03b8 for each of the first r sums. The last sum is then unconstrained and it\nyields at least n, in light of the second condition on the left of (4.6).\nIgnoring for a moment the condition X2m = 0, we are thus naturally led to a multiparameter\nversion of (3.16):\nLemma 4.3 For any r \u2265 1,\n\n1\nsup r E\u03c90\nl\u2265r l\n\n\u0012\n\nr\n\n\u2211 \u220f Ti\n\nk\n\ni\u2208I(r,l) k=1\n\n\u0013\n\n<\u221e\n\nP\u03b1 -a.s.\n\n(4.7)\n\nProof.

R EFINEMENTS\n\nUNDER STRONGLY SUBDIFFUSIVE DECAY\n\nThe goal of this section is to prove Theorem 2.4 which eliminates the need for choosing n\u22c6\nunder the assumption of a strong subdiffusive decay. Our general strategy is as follows: Since\nwe already know that on {X2n\u22c6 = 0} the walk X spends time of order n in one of the connected\ncomponents of Zd \\C\u221e,\u03b1 , it suffices to show that we can increase the time spent in this component\nby 2(n \u2212 n\u22c6 ) at a negligible cost of probability. We will achieve this by conditioning on the entry\nand exit points x, resp., y of the walk to this component and show the following regularity estimate\non the probability that the walk spends a given time in the component:\nProposition 5.1 There is c1 = c1 (\u03b1 , d) such that for any x, y \u2208 C\u221e,\u03b1 and any n > 1 and k \u2265 1,\nc1\n(1) P\u03c9x (X\u03021 = y, T1 = n) \u2264 2 |Gx \u2229 Gy |.\nn\nk\nx\n(2) P\u03c9 (X\u03021 = y, T1 = n) \u2212 P\u03c9x (X\u03021 = y, T1 = n + 2k) \u2264 c1 3 |Gx \u2229 Gy |.\nn\nWe note that the restriction to n > 1 ensures that the walk X actually steps out of C\u221e,\u03b1 . In order\nto prove these bounds, we will need some preparations. If Gx \u2229 Gy = 0/ there is nothing to prove,\nhence we suppose otherwise and set Gxy := (Gx \u2229 Gy ) \\ C\u221e,\u03b1 . Define\n(\nP\u03c9 (z, z\u2032 ),\nif z, z\u2032 \u2208 Gxy ,\n\u2032\nQ(z, z ) :=\n(5.1)\n0,\notherwise.\nThen Q is a substochastic kernel on Gxy which is reversible with respect to \u03c0\u03c9 (restricted to Gxy )\nand self-adjoint on l2 (Gxy , \u03c0\u03c9 ). Let h*, *i denote the inner product in this space and let kQk be the\ncorresponding (operator) norm of Q.\nLemma 5.2 We have kQk < 1 and, in particular, 1 \u2212 Q2 is positive and invertible.\nProof. Let n := |Gxy |. It is easy to check that Qn - regarded as an n\u00d7n matrix - has all row sums\nstrictly less than one. A simple computation then implies kQn k < 1.

The maximum is < 1 and so kQn k < 1 as well.\nAs Q is self-adjoint, we have kQn k = kQkn and so kQk < 1 as well. The positivity and\ninvertibility of 1 \u2212 Q2 directly follows.\n\u0003\n\nLet \u03b4z : Gxy \u2192 R denote the element of l2 (Gxy , \u03c0\u03c9 ) such that \u03b4z (z\u2032 ) = 1 for z\u2032 = z and zero\notherwise.

Note that we obviously have\n\nNow multiply both sides by \u03c0\u03c9 (x) and use reversibility to write \u03c0\u03c9 (x)P\u03c9 (x, z) = P\u03c9 (z, x)\u03c0\u03c9 (z).\nSince \u03c0\u03c9 (z)Qn\u22122 (z, z\u2032 ) = h\u03b4z , Qn\u22122 \u03b4z\u2032 i, the result follows by summing over z, z\u2032 \u2208 Gxy and invoking the (bi)linearity of the inner product.\n\u0003\nNow we are ready to prove the desired claims (1) and (2) above:\nProof of Proposition 5.1.

Throughout we will assume that 0 \u2208 C\u221e,\u03b1 and that X0 = 0. The proof is based on a path\ntransformation argument. Let \u22060 := n \u2212 m. Given a path X\u03020 , X\u03021 , . . . X\u0302l of the coarse-grained walk\nand the corresponding sequence of times T1 , T2 , . . . , Tl , we can record the pairs in the form\n\u0001\n\u03b3 := (x0 , t0 ), (x1 , t1 ), . . . , (xl , tl ) ,\n(5.15)\n\nwhere x j := X\u0302 j and t j := T j . Then \u03b3 is a \"path\" of the coarse-grained random walk with l = l(\u03b3 )\nsteps. We shall identify events involving only (X\u0302i , Ti )i\u22651 with sets of paths and write {\u03b3 } for the\nevent {((X\u03021 , T1 ), . . . , (X\u0302l , Tl )) = \u03b3 }.\nFor any s \u2265 1, define the path transformation \u03c6s as follows: Given \u03b3 , let k = k(\u03b3 ) be the smallest\nindex such that tk = max1\u2264 j\u2264l(\u03b3 ) t j and set\n\u0001\n\u03c6s (\u03b3 ) := (x1 , t1 ), . . . , (xk ,tk + 2s), . . . , (xl , tl ) .\n(5.16)\n(r)\n\nIt is easy to see that this is a one-to-one mapping. Furthermore, if \u03b3 \u2208 E\u03c9 ,\u03b1 (\u03b8 , m) \u2229 {X2m = 0}\n(r)\nthen \u03c6\u22060 (\u03b3 ) \u2208 E\u03c9 ,\u03b1 (\u03b8 , n) \u2229 {X2n = 0}.

The proof is\nfinished by computing the sum.\n\u0003\nThe regularity estimate from Proposition 5.4 and the universal bounds in Propositions 4.1-4.2\nallow us to complete the proof of our last main theorem. The key issue (which was not there for\nTheorem 2.3) is that these bounds do not have the same structure and thus some optimization will\nbe necessary.\nProof of Theorem 2.4. Combining Propositions 4.1, 4.2 and 5.4 we get\n\uf8f1\n\u2206\nlog(n/\u03b8 )\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\u03b8\n+\n,\nif d = 4,\nlog\n\uf8f2\n\u0001\nn3\nn\u2206\n(r)\nP\u03c90 E\u03c9 ,\u03b1 (\u03b8 , n)c , X2n = 0 \u2264 C(\u03c9 )\n\uf8f4\n1\n\u2206\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3 +\n,\nif d \u2265 5.\nd\n3\nn\nn\u2206\u03b8 2 \u22122\n\n(5.21)\n\nWe may now minimize the above expression on \u2206 \u2208 [1, n/2] and compare the result with P2n\n\u03c9 (0, 0).\nThe argument proceeds by considering separately three ranges of d.\nWe first treat the case 5 \u2264 d \u2264 8. Here we set\n\u0004\nd \u0005\n(5.22)\n\u2206 := 12 n\u03b8 1\u2212 /4 \u2208 [1, n/2] .\n\nRecalling the definition of \u03b6n from (2.23), we get\n\n\u2206\n1\nC \u0010 n \u0011d/4\u22121 2n\n\u22122 1\u2212d/4\nP\u03c9 (0, 0)\n\u03b8\n+\n=\n\u2264\nCn\nd\nn3 n\u2206\u03b8 2 \u22122\n\u03b6n (\u03c9 ) \u03b8\n\n(5.23)\n\nas desired.\nIf d \u2265 9, we need to be more careful in the choice of \u2206, since it cannot be smaller than 1.\nTherefore we set,\n\u0005\n\u0004\nd\n(5.24)\n\u2206 := 14 n\u03b8 1\u2212 /4 + 1 \u2208 [1, n/2] .\nThen,\n\n\u2206\n1\nC\u2206 C(n\u03b8 1\u2212 /4 + 1) C(n\u03b8 1\u2212 /4 + 1) 2n\n+\n=\n\u2264\nP\u03c9 (0, 0) .\n\u2264\nn3 n\u2206\u03b8 d2 \u22122\nn3\nn3\n\u03b6n (\u03c9 )\nFinally, it remains to establish the case d = 4.
