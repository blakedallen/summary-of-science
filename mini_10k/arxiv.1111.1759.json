An orthonormal set of spatially localized single-particle wave functions is obtained by\ndiagonalizing the coordinate operator for the major axis of a necked system. Using the localized single-particle wave functions, the wave function of each subsystem is defined. Therefore,\ndefined subsystem wave functions are used to obtain density distributions, mass centers, and\nenergies of subsystems. The present method is applied to separations of Margenau\u2013Brink\ncluster wave functions of \u03b1 + \u03b1, 16 O + 16 O, and \u03b1+16 O into their subsystems, and also to\nseparations of antisymmetrized molecular dynamics wave functions of 10 Be into \u03b1 + 6 He\nsubsystems. The method is simple and applicable to the separation of general Slater determinant wave functions that have neck structures into subsystem wave functions.\n\n\u00a71.\n\nIntroduction\n\nNuclear systems often exhibit multi-center structures having spatially localized\nsubsystems, as seen in phenomena such as cluster structures and fusion/fission processes. In cluster structures, each system consists of more than one spatially localized\nsubsystems, called clusters, and intercluster motion is a degree of freedom used to\ndescribe the structure of a total system. In such multi-center systems, constituent\nnucleons of each cluster and the internuclear distance are useful parameters to specify\ncluster features. Identification of subsystems is also important for nuclear reactions,\nin which colliding nuclei are subsystems. In order to have an in-depth understanding of nuclear systems with subsystems, wave functions of each subsystem should be\ndefined microscopically.\nFor microscopic wave functions of quantum fermion systems, the Slater determinant description is often adopted as used in the Hartree\u2013Fock (HF), the HF\u2013\nBogoliubov (HFB), and the time-dependent HF approaches, the Brink\u2013Bloch model,\nand the antisymmetrized molecular dynamics (AMD) method.1), 2), 3) Many applications to studies of nuclear structures and reactions show that two-center structures\nhave localized subsystems. However, a method to microscopically separate a Slater\ndeterminant into subsystem wave functions is not obvious, particularly when subsystems overlap with each other. One of the popular ways to separate the density\nof a total system into those of subsystems is to employ the method of sharp-cut\ndensity separated by a boundary plane. However, the sharp-cut density is based on\na classical picture and it is a nonphysical entity in quantum systems because density\ndistributions of subsystems have singularities at the boundary plane. Recently, a\nmethod to localize quasi-particle states by unitary transformation applied to single-\n\n\f2\n\nY. Taniguchi and Y. Kanada-En'yo\n\nparticle orbits so as to maximize difference of occupations of left and right of the neck\nposition in the HFB method (YG method).4) In the YG method, localized singleparticle wave functions depend on the neck position, which has ambiguities. In the\ncases of Margenau\u2013Brink (MB) wave functions,5) which are used in the Brink\u2013Bloch\nmodel, and AMD wave functions, subsystem wave functions can be broadly defined\nas cluster wave functions or groups of single-particle Gaussian wave packets. However, the subsystem wave functions in the overlapping region of two clusters contain\nnonphysical components that vanish because of the Pauli blocking effect, that is,\nantisymmetrization of nucleons in the total wave function. Saraceno et al. proposed\ncanonical variables of the distance and relative momentum of the mass centers of\nthe two clusters in an \u03b1\u2013\u03b1 system including the antisymmetrization effect between\nthe \u03b1 clusters (S method). However, wave functions of subsystems are not defined in\nthe method,7) and it is not applicable to systems that have one or more open-shell\nclusters.\nThe aim of this paper is to propose a method applicable for any systems to\ndefine wave functions of spatially localized subsystems in a Slater determinant wave\nfunction by a linear transformation of single-particle orbits using an operator with\nrespect to the internuclear relative coordinate. With this method, spatially localized\nsingle-particle wave functions are defined with no assumption and a total system\nis microscopically separated into subsystems. Applications to N = Z nuclei, 8 Be\n(\u03b1 + \u03b1), 32 S (16 O + 16 O), 20 Ne (\u03b1+16 O), and N 6= Z nucleus, 10 Be (\u03b1+6 He) are\nshown. We compare the internuclear distances defined by the present method with\nthose defined by sharp-cut density, single-particle Gaussian centroids of AMD wave\nfunctions, and the S method. Energies of subsystems are also discussed.\nIn \u00a72, we propose a method to define wave functions of subsystems. In \u00a73,\nthe method is applied to MB wave functions for N = Z systems and AMD wave\nfunctions of 10 Be, and the density distributions of subsystems, internuclear distance,\nand energies of subsystems are shown. In \u00a74, characteristics of the method are\ndiscussed. Finally, conclusions are given in \u00a75.\n\u00a72.\n\nas\n\nFramework\n\nSuppose a Slater determinant wave function |\u03a6i having a two-center structure\n|\u03a6i = \u00c2|\u03c6\u03031 , \u03c6\u03032 , ......, \u03c6\u0303A i,\n\n(2.1)\n\nwhere \u00c2 is the antisymmetrization operator, A is the mass number of a total system,\nand \u03c6\u03031 , ..., A are single-particle wave functions. Here, the z axis is chosen to be the\nmajor axis of the total system. Note that the total wave function |\u03a6i is invariant\nexcept for the normalization under any linear transformations of single-particle wave\nfunctions {\u03c6\u0303i } \u2192 {\u03c6i } that give nonzero determinants.\nIn order to separate the total system into two subsystems I and II, subsystem\nwave functions are defined as follows: First, single-particle wave functions are trans-\n\n\fSeparation into subsystems\nformed to diagonalize norm and coordinate operators \u1e91,\nX\n|\u03c6i i =\n|\u03c6\u0303j icji ,\n\n3\n\n(2.2)\n\nj\n\nh\u03c6i |\u03c6j i = \u03b4ij ,\nh\u03c6i |\u1e91|\u03c6j i = zi \u03b4ij ,\n\n(2.3)\n(2.4)\n\nwhere z1 \u2264 z2 \u2264 * * * \u2264 zA . The eigenvalue zi indicates the mean position of the i-th\nnucleon. If a single-particle wave function \u03c6i is localized at a certain position, zi\ncan be regarded as the nucleon position in a semi-classical picture. Therefore, it is\nnatural to classify \u03c6i into two groups {\u03c61 , \u03c62 , * * * , \u03c6A1 } and {\u03c6A1 +1 , \u03c6A1 +2 , * * * , \u03c6A }\naccording to the distribution of zi . Then, wave functions |\u03a6I i and |\u03a6II i of the\nsubsystems I and II, respectively, are described as\n|\u03a6I i = \u00c2|\u03c61 , \u03c62 , * * * , \u03c6A1 i,\n\n(2.5)\n\n|\u03a6II i = \u00c2|\u03c6A1 +1 , \u03c6A1 +2 , * * * , \u03c6A i.\n\n(2.6)\n\nHere, A1 and A2 \u2261 A \u2212 A1 are regarded as the number of nucleons constituting\nsubsystems I and II, respectively.\nOnce single-particle wave functions are separated, the internuclear distance and\nexpectation values of any operators (such as the density distribution and energy for\neach subsystem) can be calculated. The mass centers RI and RII of subsystems I\nand II are obtained as\nX\n1\nRI =\nh\u03c6i |r\u0302|\u03c6i i,\n(2.7)\nA1\ni=1,*** ,A1\n\n1\nRII =\nA2\n\nX\n\nh\u03c6i |r\u0302|\u03c6i i,\n\n(2.8)\n\ni=A1 +1,*** ,A\n\nrespectively. Then, the internuclear distance R is defined as the distance between\nthe mass centers,\nR = |RII \u2212 RI |.\n(2.9)\nDensity distributions \u03c1I (r) and \u03c1II (r) of subsystems I and II are calculated by\nX\n\u03c1i (r),\n(2.10)\n\u03c1I (r) =\ni=1,*** ,A1\n\n\u03c1II (r) =\n\nX\n\n\u03c1i (r),\n\n(2.11)\n\ni=A1 +1,*** ,A\n\nrespectively.

The kinetic term T\u0302n\u2032 \u2261 T\u0302n \u2212 T\u0302Gn with the centerof-mass correction is described as a two-body operator (see Appendix).

In the MB wave function for a system consisting of two clusters, clusters I\nand II are expressed by the shell-model configurations with centers at (0, 0, \u2212 AA2 d)\nand (0, 0, + AA1 d), respectively. The parameter d specifies the degree of cluster development. MB wave functions for two-cluster systems, \u03b1 + \u03b1, \u03b1 +16 O, and 16 O +16 O,\nare considered, and subsystem density distributions, internuclear distances, and the\nenergy of each cluster are calculated by the present method.\n3.1.1. 8 Be (\u03b1 + \u03b1)\nIn a MB wave function |\u03a6\u03b1+\u03b1 i with an \u03b1 + \u03b1 cluster structure, the \u03b1 clusters I\nand II are expressed by the (0s)4 shell model wave function shifted to the positions\n\u2212d/2 and d/2, respectively, as\n|\u03a6\u03b1+\u03b1 i = \u00c2|\u03c6\u03031 , \u03c6\u03032 , * * * , \u03c6\u03038 i,\n|\u03c6\u03031,5 i = |\u03c6\u03031,2 \u2297 p \u2191i,\n|\u03c6\u03032,6 i = |\u03c6\u03031,2 \u2297 p \u2193i,\n\n|\u03c6\u03033,7 i = |\u03c6\u03031,2 \u2297 n \u2191i,\n\n|\u03c6\u03034,8 i = |\u03c6\u03031,2 \u2297 n \u2193i,\n\u0012 \u00133\n2\u03bd 4 \u2212\u03bd (r\u00b1 d )2\n2\nhr|\u03c6\u03031,2 i =\ne\n,\n\u03c0\n\n(3.1)\n(3.2)\n(3.3)\n(3.4)\n(3.5)\n(3.6)\n\nwhere the d = (0, 0, d), p and n are a proton and neutron, respectively, the \u2191 and \u2193\nindicate up and down spins, respectively, and the \u03bd indicates the width parameter\nof Gaussian wave packets. In the large d limit, the antisymmetrization effect is\nsmall enough and the mean position of \u03b1 clusters I and II are \u2213d/2, respectively.\nTherefore, in a semi-classical picture, the parameter d is regarded as the internuclear\ndistance. However, when the spatial parts \u03c6\u03031 and \u03c6\u03032 have a non-negligible overlap\nwith each other, d does not represent the internuclear distance because the singleparticle wave functions in the overlapping region are modified by the Pauli blocking\neffect.\nThe transformation given by Eq.

R equals to d in the large d region, and as d decreases, it\ndeviates from d toward the R > d region. In the d = 0 limit also, the internuclear\ndistance R has a finite value because of the Pauli blocking effect. The behavior of R\nis qualitatively similar to that of R\u03c1 . However, quantitatively, R is slightly smaller\nthan R\u03c1 because the left and right nuclei have an overlap density in the present\ndefinition instead of the sharp-cut density.\nFigure 10 shows energies of the 16 O clusters in the 32 S as a function of internuclear distance R. In R & 7 fm region, the 16 O clusters are in the ground state, but\nin R . 7 fm region, the 16 O clusters are distorted by the antisymmetrization effect\nbetween clusters, and their excitation energies go up.\n3.2.

Gaussian centers of all nucleons are treated as independently\nvarying parameters, and therefore, no clusters are assumed. One of the advantages of\nthe AMD method is that the formation and/or breaking of clusters can be described\nin the framework. Since clusters are not assumed in the AMD model, a grouping of\nnucleons into two clusters is not necessarily obvious, unlike the MB cluster model\nwave functions.\nAnalyzing the mean position zi of nucleons for intrinsic wave functions determined by the AMD method, single-particle wave functions \u03c6i can be separated into\n\n\f10\n\nY.

Six nucleons having zi in the right of the neck can\nbe classified in subsystem II corresponding to a 6 He cluster. Figure 11 shows linear\ndensity distributions of intrinsic states of dominant components of the J \u03c0 = 0+\n1 and\n10 Be, which are separated into \u03b1 and 6 He clusters. In both states, total\nstates\nin\n0+\n2\nlinear density distributions have necks at z \u223c 0 fm, and single-particle orbits localize\nleft and right parts. Therefore, the entire 10 Be system can be separated into two\nclusters using the present separation method.\n\u00a74.\n\nDiscussions\n\nThe previous section shows that the present separation method involving the\ndiagonalization of a spatial operator of the major axis works well for the separation\nof a Slater determinant wave function into spatially localized wave functions of subsystems. The results of applications to MB wave functions with \u03b1 + \u03b1, \u03b1 + 16 O,\nand 16 O + 16 O structures are shown in Figs. 2, 5, and 8, respectively. With this\nmethod, we obtain subsystem wave functions with no singularity. Because of nonsingular wave functions, energies of subsystems do not diverge as shown in Figs. 4,\n7, and 10. This is one of the advantages over the sharp-cut method. Furthermore,\nthe present method provides single-particle wave functions of subsystems, which are\nuseful in the microscopic analysis of structures of subsystems, and is applicable to\nstudies of structural changes of subsystems in cluster structures and nuclear reactions, depending on the internuclear distance. In the applications involving AMD\n+\n10 Be, although the existence of clusters\nwave functions of J \u03c0 = 0+\n1 and 02 states in\nis not assumed, the proposed method is proven to be useful in the separation of 10 Be\nwave functions into subsystems \u03b1 and 6 He, when the neck positions and the singleparticle orbits (Fig. 11) are compared. The proposed method is applicable to the\nseparation of Slater determinant wave functions with neck structures into spatially\n\n\fY. Taniguchi and Y.

Units are in \u03bd \u22121/2 .\n\nlocalized subsystems.\nAs mentioned above, the present method gives wave functions of subsystems\nwith which expectation values of operators can be calculated. For example, the\ncalculation of mass centers of subsystems determines the internuclear distances of \u03b1\n+ \u03b1, \u03b1 + 16 O, and 16 O + 16 O systems, as shown in Figs. 3, 6, and 9, respectively. The\npresent method is useful to study cluster structures and nuclear reactions because\nthe internuclear distance is an important degree of freedom in these phenomena.\nAs an internuclear distance including the antisymmetrization effects between\nclusters, Saraceno et al. proposed the internuclear distance as one of canonical\nvariables for an \u03b1 + \u03b1 system,7)\ns\np\n1 + e\u2212\u03bdd2\nRS =\nd\n=\n1 + e\u2212\u03bdd2 R.\n(4.1)\n1 \u2212 e\u2212\u03bdd2\nWe compare RS with R and discuss properties of these internuclear distance that\ninclude the antisymmetrization effects between clusters. Although definitions of\ninternuclear distances R and RS are different, the form of R in the present definition\nresembles that of RS in the denominator, which is related\nto the antisymmetrization\np\n\u2212\u03bdd2 (Fig. 12), and in the\n1\n+\ne\neffect, but is smaller than\nR\nbecause\nof\nthe\nfactor\nS\n\u221a\nd = 0 limit, R = RS / 2. In the present method, single-particle orbits are defined to\nbe completely orthogonal. Under this condition, the internuclear distance is smaller\nthan RS . With the increase in d, both the distances R and RS approach d.\nAdvantages of the present method are as follows. First, subsystem wave functions can be obtained. They are expressed by an orthogonal set of single-particle\norbits so that the Fermion feature of constituent nucleons is respected. The internuclear distance given by our method is the largest value under this condition. With\n\n\fSeparation into subsystems\n\n13\n\nthe wave functions, subsystem properties such as the subsystem energy can be discussed. This is an advantage over the S method and the sharp-cut density method.\nSecond, our method is applicable to any systems even in cases of proton- or neutronexcess systems or systems having one or more open-shell clusters or both. Third,\nour proposed method obtains spatially localized single-particle wave functions with\nno ambiguity in a simple linear transformation, which can be an advantage over the\nYG method. In the YG method, the neck position has to be determined to obtain\nlocalized single-particle wave functions. The determination of the neck position may\nhave less ambiguity in a case of a well separated system at a scission point, but it\nmay have ambiguities in particular when two nuclei overlap to each other. Moreover,\nin a case of much proton- or neutron-rich systems, the neck position is unclear and\nneck positions of protons and neutrons can be different.\n\u00a75.\n\nConclusions\n\nIn this paper, we proposed a method to separate a Slater determinant wave\nfunction with a neck structure into spatially localized subsystems. Our method is\napplied to the MB wave functions of \u03b1 + \u03b1, \u03b1 + 16 O, and 16 O + 16 O systems, and\n+\nthe AMD wave functions of dominant components of the J \u03c0 = 0+\n1 and 02 states in\n10 Be.\nThe proposed method obtains wave functions of subsystems with no singularity,\nwhich is an advantage over the sharp-cut method. Using the obtained subsystem\nwave functions, we calculated the expectation values of several operators for subsystems. For example, the internuclear distance is well defined by the calculated mass\ncenters of the subsystems, and energies of subsystems do not diverge.\nThe proposed method is simple and applicable to a wide variety of approaches\nthat are based on the Slater determinant wave function, e.g., the HF method. It is\nuseful for the analysis of systems that have spatially localized subsystems in phenomena such as cluster structures and nuclear reactions.\nAcknowledgments\nNumerical calculations were conducted on the high-performance computing system in the Research Center for Nuclear Physics, Osaka University.
