One of the recent focus is a series of tests of CLIC\nprototype structures [2]. First test was on \"T18\" undamped structure. We established the\nexperimental system with this. Then we tested \"TD18\" damped structure. We observed\nalmost two order of magnitude higher breakdown rate[3]. We speculated that this high rate\ncame from its parameter choice, especially high magnetic field. An improved design\nparameters were realized in 24-cell structure [4], \"TD24.\" We firstly tested undamped version\n\"T24\" of this design[5]. This experiment was interrupted by the Earthquake in Tohoku area.\nAfter recovered from the damage due to the earthquake, we tested \"T24\" but it showed\ndegradation of high gradient performance, probably due to the exposure to the air. Finally and\nup to now, we have been testing the damped \"TD24\" structure. In this paper, we focus on\nthese two accelerator structure,\n\"T24\" and \"TD24\" and try to\nevaluate the basic performance\nwith respect to the CLIC criteria\non breakdown rate.\n\n2\n\n\"T24\" result\n\nThe whole processing and longrun is shown in the Figure 1. It\nwas processed to 100MV/m level\nwithin 200 hours at the short\npulse width. This is actually\nfastest of four structures, among\n\nLCWS11\n\nFigure 1: Whole processing history of \"T24\"\n\n\fundammed and damped, 18-cell and 24cell structures, as shown in Figure 2.\nHere the accelerator field is shown as\nfunction of integrated number of\naccelerator-origin fault, called ACC-BD,\naccelerator breakdown.\nAfter exposed to the air at the timing\nshown in yellow arrow in Figure 1, it\nshowed very poor performance even at\nthe operation with the short pulse width.\n\n2.1\n\nEvolution\nrate\n\nof\n\nbreakdown\n\nFigure 3 shows the breakdown rate\n(BDR) of \"T24\" as function of\naccelerator field. It was evaluated at\nseveral timings of the whole operation\nperiod. The nominal time elapsed before\nsuch evaluation counted from the\nbeginning of processing is shown in the\nfigure in hours. The dashed lines are for\nguiding eye and its slope was taken\nfrom the fitting of the first evaluation at\n400 hours. If the slope does not change\nmuch, those data points in later timing\nindicate that it can run with meeting the\nCLIC criteria (3X10-7 bpp/m) at 100\nMV/m. Note that the pulse width of\nthe present operation for this test was\n252 nsec, while CLIC operates at 156\nnsec in its flat top with slow ramping at\nthe beginning. This may even decrease\nthe BDR of the actual pulse shape.\nIf we read those value which these\ndashed lines intersect to the 100 MV/m\nline, the result shows clearly the\nreduction of the BDR of this structure,\nas shown in Figure 4. It showed actually\never decreasing feature even later than\n1500 hours of operation.\n\nFigure 2: Comparison of initial processing\n\nFigure 3: BDR of \"T24\" vs Eacc\n\nFigure 4: Evolution of BDR of \"T24\"\nLCWS11\n\n\f2.2\n\nDeterioration due to arcing\n\nThe vacuum discharge may modify\nthe copper surface of the accelerating\ncell. It will detune the cell frequency,\nresulting in a change of total phase\nadvance through the structure. The\ntotal phase advance along the whole\nstructure of T24 was measured in a\nlow power setup. As shown in Figure\n5, it showed the phase shift decrease\nof 2 degrees along the structure\n\"T24,\" which is equivalent to the\nfrequency increase of 0.16 MHz in\naverage if we take into account\nvarious environmental parameters\nduring the measurement.\nThis\nmeasurement\nis\nFigure 5: Total phase shift along structure.\nsusceptible to many perturbations,\nsuch as temperature and humidity,\nand we admit that this measurement should be refrained to confirm the result in a condition\nwith the smaller systematic errors. Note that his change should be small enough for the whole\nlife of the accelerator structure.\n\n3\n\nTests in simple geometry\n\nA series of tests with simpler geometry\nis being prepared at KEK for studying\nthe mechanism of breakdowns and for\nsearching the suppression methods.\nThe so-called \"single-cell\" setup [6]\nshown in Figure 6 is in mind. In this\nfigure, RF power comes from right in a\nTM02 mode in a circular waveguide.\nThe first cell, matching cell, adjusts\nthe impedance from circular pipe to\nthe three accelerator cells. The center\ncell has highest field. The last cell\nbehaves just the same as the first, but\nstops the power to left keeping the\naccelerator geometry kept for the\ncenter cell. This figure shows the case\nof damped cell as the center cell\nA small concrete vault is being\nprepared for this test as shown in\nFigure 7.\nLCWS11\n\nFigure 6: Test in simple geometry.\n\n\f4\n\nAcknowlegment\n\nMost of the present study has been\nproceeding\nunder\na\ntight\ncollaboration among CERN, SLAC\nand KEK.
