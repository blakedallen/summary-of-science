The values of the matrix elements can only be determined by experiment. Heavy\nQuark Effective Theory (HQET) provides a means to extract the magnitude of the element Vcb from\nparticular semileptonic b decays, with relatively small theoretical uncertainties [1].\nIn this paper, the value of |Vcb | is extracted by studying the decay rate for the process B\u03040 \u2192 D\u2217+ l\u2212 \u03bd\u0304\nas a function of the recoil kinematics of the D\u2217+ meson 1 [2\u20134]. The decay rate is parameterised as\na function of the variable \u03c9, defined as the scalar product of the four-velocities of the D\u2217+ and B\u03040\nmesons. This is related to the square of the four-momentum transfer from the B\u03040 to the l\u2212 \u03bd\u0304 system,\nq 2 , by\nm2 \u2217+ + m2B0 \u2212 q 2\n,\n(1)\n\u03c9= D\n2mB0 mD\u2217+\nand ranges from 1, when the D\u2217+ is produced at rest in the B\u03040 rest frame, to about 1.50. Using\nHQET, the differential partial width for this decay is given by\nd\u0393(B\u03040 \u2192 D\u2217+ l\u2212 \u03bd\u0304)\n1 dBr(B\u03040 \u2192 D\u2217+ l\u2212 \u03bd\u0304)\n=\n= K(\u03c9)F 2 (\u03c9)|Vcb |2 ,\nd\u03c9\n\u03c4 B0\nd\u03c9\n\n(2)\n\nwhere K(\u03c9) is a known phase space term and F(\u03c9) is the hadronic form factor for this decay [3].\nAlthough the shape of this form factor is not known, its magnitude at zero recoil, \u03c9 = 1, can be\nestimated using HQET. In the heavy quark limit (mb \u2192 \u221e), F(\u03c9) coincides with the Isgur-Wise\nfunction [4] which is normalised to unity at the point of zero recoil. Corrections to F(1) have been\ncalculated to take into account the effects of finite quark masses and QCD corrections, yielding the\nvalue and theoretical uncertainty F(1) = 0.913 \u00b1 0.042 [5]. Since the phase space factor K(w) tends\nto zero as \u03c9 \u2192 1, the decay rate vanishes at \u03c9 = 1 and the accuracy of the extrapolation relies on\nachieving a reasonably constant reconstruction efficiency in the region near \u03c9 = 1.\nPrevious measurements of |Vcb | have been made using B mesons produced on the \u03a5(4S) resonance\n[6] and in Z0 decays [7\u20139]. These analyses used a linear or constrained quadratic expansion of F(\u03c9)\naround \u03c9 = 1. An improved theoretical analysis, based on dispersive bounds and including higher\norder corrections, has since become available [10]. This results in a parameterisation for F(\u03c9) in terms\nof F(1) and a single unknown parameter \u03c12 constrained to lie in the range \u22120.14 < \u03c12 < 1.54, \u03c12\ncorresponding to the slope of F(\u03c9) at zero recoil.\nThe previous OPAL measurement [9] used the decay chain D\u2217+ \u2192 D0 \u03c0 + , with the D0 meson\nbeing reconstructed in the exclusive decay channels D0 \u2192 K\u2212 \u03c0 + and D0 \u2192 K\u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 0 . In this paper,\na new analysis is described in which only the \u03c0 + from the D\u2217+ decay is identified, and no attempt\nis made to reconstruct the D0 decay exclusively. This technique, first employed by DELPHI [8, 11],\ngives a much larger sample of B\u03040 \u2192 D\u2217+ l\u2212 \u03bd\u0304 decays than the previous measurement, but also larger\nbackground, requiring a rather more complex analysis. The measurement of [9] is also updated to use\nthe new parameterisation of F(\u03c9) [10], and improved background models and physics inputs. In both\ncases, the initial number of B0 mesons is determined from other measurements of B0 production in Z0\ndecays.\nThe new reconstruction technique is described in Section 2, the determination of \u03c9 for each event\nin Section 3, the fit to extract F(1)|Vcb | and \u03c12 in Section 4 and the systematic errors in Section 5.\nThe updated exclusive measurement is discussed in Section 6 and the measurements are combined\nand conclusions drawn in Section 7.\n1\n\nCharge conjugate reactions are always implied, and the symbol l refers to either an electron or muon.\n\n\f4\n\nInclusive reconstruction of B\u03040 \u2192 D\u2217+l\u2212 \u03bd\u0304 events\n\n2\n\nThe OPAL detector is well described elsewhere [12]. The data sample used in this analysis consists of\nabout 4 million hadronic Z0 decays collected during the period 1991\u20131995, at centre-of-mass energies\nin the vicinity of the Z0 resonance. Corresponding simulated event samples were generated using\nJETSET 7.4 [13] as described in [14].\nHadronic Z0 decays were selected using standard criteria [14]. To ensure the event was well\ncontained within the acceptance of the detector, the thrust axis direction2 was required to satisfy\n| cos \u03b8T | < 0.9. Charged tracks and electromagnetic calorimeter clusters with no associated tracks\nwere then combined into jets using a cone algorithm [15], with a cone half angle of 0.65 rad and a\nminimum jet energy of 5 GeV. The transverse momentum pt of each track was defined relative to the\naxis of the jet containing it, where the jet axis was calculated including the momentum of the track.\nA total of 3 117 544 events passed the event selection.\nThe reconstruction of B\u03040 \u2192 D\u2217+ l\u2212 \u03bd\u0304 events was then performed by combining high p and pt lepton\n(electron or muon) candidates with oppositely charged pions from the D\u2217+ \u2192 D0 \u03c0 + decay. Electrons\nwere identified and photon conversions rejected using neural network algorithms [14], and muons were\nidentified as in [16]. Both electrons and muons were required to have momenta p > 2 GeV, transverse\nmomenta with respect to the jet axis pt > 0.7 GeV, and to lie in the polar angle region | cos \u03b8| < 0.9.\nThe event sample was further enhanced in semileptonic b decays by requiring a separated secondary\nvertex with decay length significance L/\u03c3L > 2 in any jet of the event. The vertex reconstruction\nalgorithm and decay length significance calculation are described fully in [14]. Together with the\nlepton selection, these requirements result in a sample which is about 90 % pure in bb events.\nAn attempt was made to estimate the D0 direction in each jet containing a lepton candidate. Each\ntrack (apart from the lepton) and calorimeter cluster in the jet was assigned a weight corresponding\nto the estimated probability that it came from the D0 decay. The track weight was calculated from\nan artificial neural network, trained to separate tracks from b decays and fragmentation tracks in\nb jets [14]. The network inputs are the track momentum, transverse momentum with respect to the\njet axis, and impact parameter significances with respect to the reconstructed primary and secondary\nvertices (if existing). The cluster weights were calculated using their energies and angles with respect\nto the jet axis alone, the energies first being corrected by subtracting the energy of any charged tracks\nassociated to the cluster [17].\nBeginning with the track or cluster with the largest weight, tracks and clusters were then grouped\ntogether until the invariant mass of the group (assigning tracks the pion mass and clusters zero mass)\nexceeded the charm hadron mass, taken to be 1.8 GeV. If the final invariant mass exceeded 2.3 GeV,\nthe jet was rejected, since Monte Carlo studies showed such high mass D0 candidates were primarily\nbackground. For surviving jets, the momentum pD0 of the group was used as an estimate of the D0\ndirection, q\ngiving RMS angular resolutions of about 45 mrad in \u03c6 and \u03b8. The D0 energy was calculated\nas ED0 = p2D0 + m2D0 .\nThe selection of pions from D\u2217+ decays relies on the small mass difference of only 145 MeV [18]\nbetween the D\u2217+ and D0 , which means the pions have very little transverse momentum with respect\nto the D0 direction. Each track in the jet (other than the lepton) was considered as a slow pion\ncandidate, provided it satisfied 0.5 < p < 2.5 GeV and had a transverse momentum with respect to\nthe D0 direction of less than 0.3 GeV. If the pion under consideration was included in the reconstructed\nD0 , it was removed and the D0 momentum and energy recalculated. The final selection was made\nusing the reconstructed mass difference \u2206m between D\u2217+ and D0 mesons, calculated as\n\u2206m =\n\nq\n\n2 \u2212 |p \u2217 |2 \u2212 m 0 ,\nED\n\u2217\nD\nD\n\nwhere the D\u2217+ energy is given by ED\u2217 = ED0 + E\u03c0 and momentum by pD\u2217 = pD0 + p\u03c0 .\n2\n\nA right handed coordinate system is used, with positive z along the electron beam direction and x pointing to the\ncentre of the LEP ring. The polar and azimuthal angles are denoted by \u03b8 and \u03c6.\n\n\f5\n\nA new secondary vertex was then iteratively reconstructed around an initial seed vertex formed\nby the intersection of the lepton and slow pion tracks. Every other track in the jet was added in turn\nto the seed vertex, and the vertex refitted. The track resulting in the lowest vertex fit \u03c72 was retained\nin the seed vertex for the next iteration. The procedure was repeated until no more tracks could be\nadded without reducing the vertex fit \u03c72 probability to less than 1 %. The decay length L\u2032 between\nthe primary vertex and this secondary vertex, and the associated error \u03c3L\u2032 , were calculated as in [14].\nThe pion candidate was accepted if the decay length satisfied \u22120.1 cm < L\u2032 < 2 cm and the decay\nlength significance satisfied L\u2032 /\u03c3L\u2032 > \u22122.\nThe resulting distributions of \u2206m for opposite and same sign lepton-pion combinations are shown\nin Figure 1(a) and (b). The predictions of the Monte Carlo simulation are also shown, broken down\ninto contributions from signal B\u03040 \u2192 D\u2217+ l\u2212 \u03bd\u0304 events, 'resonant' background containing real leptons and\nslow pions from D\u2217+ decay, and combinatorial background, made up of events with fake slow pions,\nfake leptons or both.\nIn Monte Carlo simulation, about 45 % of opposite sign events with \u2206m < 0.17 GeV are signal\n0\nB\u0304 \u2192 D\u2217+ l\u2212 \u03bd\u0304 events, 14 % are resonant background and 41 % are combinatorial background. The\nresonant background is made up mainly of B\u2212 \u2192 D\u2217+ \u03c0 \u2212 l\u2212 \u03bd\u0304, B\u03040 \u2192 D\u2217+ \u03c0 0 l\u2212 \u03bd\u0304 and B\u0304s \u2192 D\u2217+ K0 l\u2212 \u03bd\u0304\ndecays. These are expected to be dominated by b semileptonic decays involving orbitally excited\ncharm mesons (generically referred to as D\u2217\u2217 ), e.g. B\u2212 \u2192 D\u2217\u22170 l\u2212 \u03bd\u0304 followed by D\u2217\u22170 \u2192 D\u2217+ \u03c0 \u2212 .\nThese decays will be denoted collectively by B\u0304 \u2192 D\u2217+ h l\u2212 \u03bd\u0304. Small contributions are also expected\n\u2212\nfrom b \u2192 D\u2217+ \u03c4 \u03bd\u0304X decays with the \u03c4 decaying leptonically, and b \u2192 D\u2217+ D\u2212\ns X with the Ds decaying\nsemileptonically (each about 1 % of opposite sign events). For same sign events with \u2206m < 0.17 GeV,\nthere is a small resonant contribution of about 6 % from events with a real D\u2217+ \u2192 D0 \u03c0 + where the\nD0 decays semileptonically, and the rest is combinatorial background.\nThe most important background, from B\u0304 \u2192 D\u2217+ h l\u2212 \u03bd\u0304 decays, comes from both charged B+ and\nneutral B0 and Bs decays, whereas the signal comes only from B0 decays. Therefore the charge Qvtx of\nthe reconstructed secondary vertex containing the lepton and slow pion and its estimated error \u03c3Qvtx\nwere calculated, using\nQvtx =\n\nX\n\nwi qi ,\n\nX\n\nwi (1 \u2212 wi )qi2 ,\n\ni\n\n2\n\u03c3Q\nvtx\n\n=\n\ni\n\nwhere wi is the weight for track i of charge qi to come from the secondary vertex, and the sums are\ntaken over all tracks in the jet [19,20]. The weights were calculated in a similar way to those used for the\nD0 direction reconstruction, using a neural network with the track momentum, transverse momentum\nand impact parameter significances with respect to the reconstructed primary and secondary vertices\nas inputs. The weights for the lepton and slow pion candidate tracks were set to one. The vertex\ncharge distributions for opposite sign events with \u2206m < 0.17 GeV are shown in Figure 1(c) and (d).\nThe reconstructed vertex charge and error were used to divide the data into different classes\nenhanced or depleted in B+ decays, thus reducing the effect of this background and increasing the\nstatistical sensitivity. Three classes c were used-class 1 where the charge is measured poorly (\u03c3Qvtx >\n0.9), class 2 where the charge is measured well and is compatible with a neutral vertex (\u03c3Qvtx < 0.9,\n|Qvtx | < 0.5) and class 3 where the charge is measured well and is compatible with a charged vertex\n(\u03c3Qvtx < 0.9, |Qvtx | > 0.5).\n\n3\n\nReconstruction of \u03c9\n\nThe recoil variable \u03c9 was estimated in each event using the reconstructed four-momentum transfer to\nthe l\u03bd\u0304 system:\nq 2 = (EB0 \u2212 ED\u2217 )2 \u2212 (pB0 \u2212 pD\u2217 )2\n\n\fopposite sign\n\n2500\n\n(a)\n\n2000\n1500\n\nevents / 0.05 GeV\n\nevents / 0.05 GeV\n\n6\n\n1000\n\n250\n\n1750\n\nOPAL data\nB0 \u2192 D*+l-\u03bd\nresonant bgd.\ncombinatorial bgd.\n\n1500\n1250\n1000\n\n250\n0.15\n\n0.2\n\n\u03c3Qvtx >0.9\nClass 1\n\n0\n\n0.25\n0.3\n\u2206m (GeV)\n(c)\n\n600\n\n150\n\n300\n\n100\n\n200\n\n50\n\n100\n0\n2\nvertex charge Qvtx\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n\u03c3Qvtx<0.9\nClass 3\n\n400\n\n-2\n\n0.15\n\n500\n\n200\n\n0\n\n(b)\n\n500\n\nevents / 0.1\n\nevents / 0.1\n\n300\n\nsame sign\n\n750\n\n500\n0\n\n2000\n\n-2\n\n0.25\n0.3\n\u2206m (GeV)\n(d)\nClass 2\nClass 3\n\n0\n2\nvertex charge Qvtx\n\nFigure 1: Reconstructed \u2206m distributions for selected (a) opposite sign and (b) same sign lepton-pion\ncombinations; reconstructed vertex charge Qvtx distributions for opposite sign events with \u2206m <\n0.17 GeV and (c) \u03c3Qvtx > 0.9 and (d) \u03c3Qvtx < 0.9. In each case the data are shown by the points\nwith error bars, and the Monte Carlo simulation contributions from signal B\u03040 \u2192 D\u2217+ l\u2212 \u03bd\u0304 decays, other\nresonant D\u2217+ decays and combinatorial background are shown by the open, single and cross hatched\nhistograms respectively. The vertex charge classes 1 (poorly reconstructed), 2 (well reconstructed\nneutral vertex) and 3 (well reconstructed charged vertex) are indicated.\n\n\f7\n\ntogether with equation 1. The B0 and D\u2217+ energies EB0 and ED\u2217 were estimated directly, whilst the\nmomentum vectors pB0 and pD\u2217 were estimated using the energies together with the reconstructed\npolar and azimuthal angles, as described in more detail below.\nSince the slow pion has very little momentum in the rest frame of the decaying D\u2217+ , the momentum\n(and hence energy) of the D\u2217+ was estimated by scaling the reconstructed slow pion momentum by\nmD\u2217+ /m\u03c0 , as for the D0 \u2192 K\u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 0 channel in [9]. A small correction (never exceeding 12 %) was\napplied, as a function of cos \u03b8 \u2217 , the angle of the slow pion in the rest frame of the D0 . This procedure\ngave a fractional D\u2217+ energy resolution of 15 %. The polar and azimuthal angles of the D\u2217+ were\nreconstructed using weighted averages of the slow pion and D0 directions, giving resolutions of about\n22 mrad on both \u03c6 and \u03b8.\nThe energy of the B0 was estimated using a technique similar to that described in [21], exploiting the\noverall energy and momentum conservation in the event to calculate the energy of the unreconstructed\nneutrino. First, the energy Ebjet of the jet containing the B0 was inferred from the measured particles\nin the rest of the event, by treating the event as a two-body decay of a Z0 into a b jet (whose mass was\napproximated by the B0 mass) and another object making up the rest of the event. Then, the total\nfragmentation energy Efrag in the b jet was estimated from the measured visible energy in the b jet\nand the identified B0 decay products: Efrag = Evis \u2212 El \u2212 ED\u2217 . Finally, the B0 energy was calculated\nas EB0 = Ebjet \u2212 Efrag , giving an RMS resolution of 4.4 GeV.\nThe b direction was estimated using a combination of two techniques. In the first, the momentum\nvector of the B0 was reconstructed from its decay products:\npB0 = pD\u2217 + pl + p\u03bd\u0304 ,\nthe neutrino energy being estimated from the reverse of the event visible momentum vector: p\u03bd\u0304 =\n\u2212pvis . The visible momentum was calculated using all the reconstructed tracks and clusters in the\nevent, with a correction for charged particles measured both in the tracking detectors and calorimeters\n[17]. This direction estimate is strongly degraded if a second neutrino is present (e.g. from another\nsemileptonic b decay in the opposite hemisphere of the event), and its error was parameterised as a\nfunction of the visible energy in the opposite hemisphere. The resulting resolution is typically between\n40 and 100 mrad for both \u03c6 and \u03b8.\nThe second method of estimating the B0 direction used the vertex flight direction-i.e. the direction of the vector between the primary vertex and the secondary vertex reconstructed around the\nlepton and slow pion as described in Section 2. The accuracy of this estimate is strongly dependent on\nthe B0 decay length, and was used only if the decay length significance L\u2032 /\u03c3L\u2032 exceeded 3. After this\ncut, the angular resolution varies between about 15 and 100 mrad, and is worse for \u03b8 in the 1991 and\n1992 data where accurate z information from the silicon microvertex detector was not available. The\nB\u03040 \u2192 D\u2217+ l\u2212 \u03bd\u0304 candidate was rejected if the two reconstruction methods gave \u03b8 or \u03c6 angles disagreeing\nby more than three standard deviations, which happened in 7 % of Monte Carlo signal events. Finally,\nthe two B0 direction estimates were combined according to their estimated uncertainties, giving average resolutions of 35 mrad on \u03c6 and 43 mrad on \u03b8, including events where only the first method was\nused.\nThe estimate of q 2 derived from the B0 and D\u2217+ energies and angles was improved by applying\nthe constraint that the mass \u03bc of the neutrino produced in the B\u03040 \u2192 D\u2217+ l\u2212 \u03bd\u0304 decay should be zero.\nThe neutrino mass is given from the reconstructed quantities by:\n\u03bc2 = (EB0 \u2212 ED\u2217 \u2212 El )2 \u2212 (pB0 \u2212 pD\u2217 \u2212 pl )2 .\nThe constraint was implemented by calculating q 2 using a kinematic fit, incorporating the measured\nvalues and estimated uncertainties of the B0 and D\u2217+ energies and angles (the B0 angular uncertainties varying event by event). This procedure improved the average q 2 resolution from 2.78 GeV2\nto 2.57 GeV2 . In Monte Carlo simulation, 11 % of signal events were reconstructed with q 2 < 0,\ncorresponding to an unphysical value of \u03c9 larger than \u03c9max \u2248 1.5, and were rejected.\n\n\f8\n\nThe resulting distributions of reconstructed \u03c9 for various ranges of true \u03c9 (denoted \u03c9 \u2032 ) in simulated\nB\u03040 \u2192 D\u2217+ l\u2212 \u03bd\u0304 decays are shown in Figure 2(a\u2013e). The average RMS \u03c9 resolution is about 0.12, but\nthere are significant non-Gaussian tails. The resolution was parameterised (separately for the 1991\u20132\nand 1993\u20135 data) as a continuous function R(\u03c9, \u03c9 \u2032 ) giving the expected distribution of reconstructed\n\u03c9 for each true value \u03c9 \u2032 . The resolution function was implemented as the sum of two asymmetric\nGaussians (i.e. with different widths either side of the peak) whose parameters were allowed to vary\nas a function of \u03c9 \u2032 . The convolution of this resolution function with the Monte Carlo \u03c9 \u2032 distribution\nis also shown in Figure 2(a\u2013e), demonstrating that the resolution function models the \u03c9 distributions\nwell.\nThe efficiency to reconstruct B\u03040 \u2192 D\u2217+ l\u2212 \u03bd\u0304 decays \u01eb(\u03c9 \u2032 ) is shown in Figure 2(f), together with a\nsecond order polynomial parameterisation. The efficiency varies with \u03c9 \u2032 , but is reasonably flat in the\ncritical region near \u03c9 \u2032 = 1 where the extrapolation to measure F(1)|Vcb | is carried out.\n\n4\n\nFit and results\n\nThe values of F(1)|Vcb | and \u03c12 were extracted using an extended maximum likelihood fit to the\nreconstructed mass difference \u2206m, recoil \u03c9 and vertex charge class c of each event. Both opposite and\nsame sign events with \u2206m < 0.3 GeV and \u03c9 < \u03c9max were used in the fit, the high \u2206m and same sign\nevents serving to constrain the combinatorial background normalisation and shapes in the opposite\nsign low \u2206m region populated by the B\u03040 \u2192 D\u2217+ l\u2212 \u03bd\u0304 decays. Using the \u2206m value from each event in\nthe fit, rather than just dividing the data into low \u2206m 'signal' and high \u2206m 'sideband' mass regions,\nincreases the statistical sensitivity as the signal purity varies considerably within the low \u2206m region.\nThe logarithm of the overall likelihood was given by\nb\n\na\n\nln L =\n\nM\nX\n\nln Lai\n\n+\n\nM\nX\n\nln Lbj \u2212 N a \u2212 N b\n\n(3)\n\nj=1\n\ni=1\n\nwhere the sums of individual event log-likelihoods ln Lai and ln Lbj are taken over all the observed M a\nopposite sign and M b same sign events in the data sample, and N a and N b are the corresponding\nexpected numbers of events.\nThe likelihood for each opposite sign event was given in terms of different types or sources of event\nby\nLai (\u2206mi , \u03c9i , ci ) =\n\n4\nX\n\na\nNsa fs,c\nMs,ci (\u2206mi ) Ps (\u03c9i )\ni\n\n(4)\n\ns=1\na is the fraction of events in source s\nwhere Nsa is the number of expected events for source s, fs,c\nappearing in vertex charge class c, Ms,c (\u2206m) is the mass difference distribution for source s in class\na sum\nc and Ps (\u03c9) the recoil distribution for source s. For each source, the vertex charge fractions fs,c\nto one and the mass difference Ms,c (\u2206mi ) and recoil Ps (\u03c9) distributions are normalised to one. The\nP\ntotal number of expected events is given by the sum of the individual contributions: N a = 4s=1 Nsa .\nThere are four opposite sign sources: (1) signal B\u03040 \u2192 D\u2217+ l\u2212 \u03bd\u0304 events, (2) B\u0304 \u2192 D\u2217+ h l\u2212 \u03bd\u0304 events\nwhere the D\u2217+ is produced via an intermediate resonance (D\u2217\u2217 ), (3) other opposite sign background\ninvolving a genuine lepton and a slow pion from D\u2217+ decay and (4) combinatorial background. The\nsum of sources 2 and 3 are shown as 'resonant background' in Figure 1. A similar expression to\nequation 4 was used for Lbj , the event likelihood for same sign events. In this case, only sources 3\nand 4 contribute.\nThe mass difference distributions Mc,s (\u2206m) for sources 1\u20133 were represented by analytic functions,\nwhose parameters were determined using large numbers of simulated events, as were the recoil distributions Ps (\u03c9) for sources 2 and 3. The fractions in each vertex charge class for sources 1\u20133 were also\ntaken from simulation.

The factor of four accounts for the two b hadrons produced per Z0 \u2192 bb event and the\ntwo identified lepton species (electrons and muons). The form factor F(\u03c9 \u2032 ) is given in [10] in terms of\nthe normalisation F(1) and slope parameter \u03c12 . The efficiency function \u01eb(\u03c9 \u2032 ) and resolution function\nR(\u03c9, \u03c9 \u2032 ) were described in Section 3, and the known phase space factor K(\u03c9 \u2032 ) is given in [9]. The\nassumed values of the numerical quantities are given in Table 1.\nSince the data are divided into different vertex charge classes enhanced and depleted in B+ decays,\nthe fit gives some information on the amount of B\u0304 \u2192 D\u2217+ h l\u2212 \u03bd\u0304 background. The predicted level of\nthis background in the fit was therefore allowed to vary under a Gaussian constraint corresponding\nto the branching ratio of Br(b \u2192 D\u2217+ h l\u03bd\u0304) = (0.76 \u00b1 0.16) %. The latter has been calculated from\nthe measured branching ratio Br(b \u2192 D\u2217+ \u03c0 \u2212 l\u03bd\u0304X) = (0.473 \u00b1 0.095) % [22], assuming isospin and\nSU(3) flavour symmetry to obtain the corresponding b \u2192 D\u2217+ \u03c0 0 l\u03bd\u0304 and b \u2192 D\u2217+ K0 l\u03bd\u0304 branching\nratios. A scaling factor of 0.75 \u00b1 0.25 was included for the last branching ratio to account for possible\nSU(3) violation effects reducing the branching ratio D\u2217\u2217+\n\u2192 D\u2217+ K0 compared to the expectation of\ns\n3\n\u2217\u2217+\n\u2217+\n0\n\u2192 D \u03c0 ). The P2 (\u03c9) distribution for these events was taken from simulation, using the\n2 Br(D\ncalculation of Leibovich et al. [23] to predict their recoil spectrum.\nThe numbers N3a,b and P3 (\u03c9) distributions for the small background contributions covered by\nsource 3 (both opposite and same sign) were taken from Monte Carlo simulation, with branching\nratios adjusted to the values given in Table 1. The branching ratio for b \u2192 D\u2217+ \u03c4 \u2212 \u03bd\u0304 was derived\nusing the inclusive branching ratio Br(b \u2192 \u03c4 X) = (2.6 \u00b1 0.4) % [18], assuming a D\u2217+ is produced in\na fraction 0.25 \u00b1 0.03 of the time, as seen for the corresponding decays b \u2192 D\u2217+ lX and b \u2192 lX\n(l = e, \u03bc) [18]. The rate of b \u2192 D\u2217+ D\u2212\ns X was assumed to be dominated by the two body decay\n(\u2217)\u2212\n0\n\u2217+\n\u2217+\nB\u0304 \u2192 D Ds . The rate of real D decays in the same sign background depends on the production\nfractions of D\u2217+ in bb and cc events, which were taken from [24].\na ,\nThe parameters of the analytic functions describing the combinatorial background (N4a , N4b , f4,c\nb\nf4,c , M4,c (\u2206m) and P4 (\u03c9)) were fitted entirely from the data, with only the choice of functional forms\nmotivated by simulation. The shapes of the mass and recoil functions (including a small correlation\nbetween \u2206m and \u03c9) are constrained by the same sign sample (which is almost entirely combinatorial\n\n\f11\n\nbackground), and are the same for each vertex charge class c. The opposite sign high \u2206m region\nserves to normalise the number of combinatorial background events in the low \u2206m region for each\nvertex charge class.\nThe values of F(1)|Vcb | and \u03c12 were extracted by maximising the total likelihood given by equation 3. The values of F(1)|Vcb | and \u03c12 were allowed to vary, together with the level of B\u0304 \u2192 D\u2217+ h l\u2212 \u03bd\u0304\nbackground and 13 auxiliary parameters describing the combinatorial background distributions. A\nresult of\nF(1)|Vcb | = (37.5 \u00b1 1.2) \u00d7 10\u22123 ,\n\u03c12 = 1.12 \u00b1 0.14\nwas obtained, where the errors are only statistical. The correlation between F(1)|Vcb | and \u03c12 is 0.77.\nThe distributions of reconstructed \u03c9 for opposite and same sign events with \u2206m < 0.17 GeV, together\nwith the fit results, are shown in Figure 3. The fit describes the data well, both in this region and the\nhigh \u2206m region dominated by combinatorial background, for all three of the vertex charge classes.\nBy integrating the differential partial decay width (equation 2) over all values of \u03c9, the branching\nratio Br(B\u03040 \u2192 D\u2217+ l\u2212 \u03bd\u0304) was also determined to be\nBr(B\u03040 \u2192 D\u2217+ l\u2212 \u03bd\u0304) = (5.92 \u00b1 0.27) % ,\nwhere again the error is statistical only. This result is consistent with the world average once systematic\nerrors are included.\nMany previous results\nhave been obtained \u0003using a constrained quadratic expansion for the form\n\u0002\nfactor: F(\u03c9) = F(1) 1 \u2212 a2 (\u03c9 \u2212 1) + b(\u03c9 \u2212 1)2 , where a is a slope parameter to be determined by the\nfit, and b is constrained to b = 0.66a2 \u2212 0.11 [25]. To allow comparison with such measurements, the fit\nwas also performed with this parameterisation of F(\u03c9), giving the results F(1)|Vcb | = (36.9\u00b11.2)\u00d710\u22123\nand a2 = 0.88 \u00b1 0.14, the correlation between F(1)|Vcb | and a2 being 0.79. The difference in the two\ncurvature parameters \u03c12 and a2 is in good agreement with the expectation of \u03c12 \u2212 a2 \u2248 0.21 [10].\n\n5\n\nSystematic Errors\n\nSystematic errors arise from the uncertainties in the fit input parameters given in Table 1, the Monte\nCarlo modelling of the signal \u03c9 resolution, the recoil spectrum of b \u2192 D\u2217\u2217 l\u03bd\u0304 decays and selection\nefficiencies, and possible biases in the fitting method. The resulting systematic errors on the values of\nF(1)|Vcb |, \u03c12 and Br(B\u03040 \u2192 D\u2217+ l\u2212 \u03bd\u0304) are summarized in Table 2 and described in more detail below.\nInput quantities: The various numerical fit inputs were each varied according to the errors given in\nTable 1 and the fit repeated to assess the resulting uncertainties.\nb \u2192 D\u2217\u2217l\u03bd\u0304 decays: The calculation of Leibovich et al. [23] was used to simulate the recoil spectrum\nof B\u0304 \u2192 D\u2217+ h l\u2212 \u03bd\u0304 decays, assumed to be produced via the semileptonic decay B0 \u2192 D\u2217\u2217 l\u03bd\u0304.\nHere D\u2217\u2217 represents a P-wave orbitally excited charm meson. The calculation predicts the recoil\nspectra and relative rates of semileptonic decays involving both the narrow D1 and D\u22172 states\nand wide D\u22170 and D\u22171 states. All these decays are suppressed close to \u03c9 = 1 by an extra factor\nof (\u03c9 2 \u2212 1) when compared with the signal B\u03040 \u2192 D\u2217+ l\u2212 \u03bd\u0304 decays. This reduces the uncertainty\ndue to the rate of B\u0304 \u2192 D\u2217+ h l\u2212 \u03bd\u0304 decays in the extrapolation of the signal recoil spectrum to\n\u03c9 = 1. Non-resonant B\u0304 \u2192 D\u2217+ h l\u2212 \u03bd\u0304 decays are not included in the model, but are not expected\nto contribute close to \u03c9 = 1.\nThe differential decay rates in [23] are given in terms of five possible expansion schemes and\nseveral unknown parameters: a kinetic energy term \u03b7ke and the slopes of the Isgur-Wise functions\nfor the narrow and wide D\u2217\u2217 states \u03c4\u02c61 and \u03b6\u02c61 .

The fractional errors on F(1)|Vcb | and Br(B\u03040 \u2192 D\u2217+ l\u2212 \u03bd\u0304) are given, whereas\nthe errors on \u03c12 are absolute.\nranges \u22120.75 < \u03b7ke < 0.75 GeV, \u22122 < \u03c4\u02c61 < \u22121 and \u22122 < \u03b6\u02c61 < 0 subject to the constraint that\nthe ratio R = \u0393(B\u0304 \u2192 D2\u2217 l\u03bd\u0304)/(\u0393(B\u0304 \u2192 D1 l\u03bd\u0304) lie within the measured range R = 0.37 \u00b1 0.16\n[22, 26]. This excludes the expansion schemes A\u221e and B\u221e of [23] and constrains the allowable\nvalues of \u03b7ke in the others. The fraction of B\u0304 \u2192 D\u2217\u2217 l\u2212 \u03bd\u0304 decays involving the narrow D1 and\nD\u22172 states, which is not precisely predicted, was varied in the range 0.22 \u00b1 0.06, obtained by\ncomparing the measured rates for B0 semileptonic decays involving D+ , D\u2217+ , D1 and D\u22172 with\nthe inclusive semileptonic decay rate [18, 22, 26]. The systematic errors were determined as half\nthe difference between the two parameter sets giving the most extreme variations in F(1)|Vcb |\nand \u03c12 , and the central values were adjusted to half way between these two extremes. The\nvalues of both F(1)|Vcb | and \u03c12 are most sensitive to variations in \u03b7ke , which is constrained by\nthe measured value of R.\nb fragmentation: The effect of uncertainties in the average b hadron energy hxE i = Eb /Ebeam\nwas assessed in Monte Carlo simulation by reweighting the events so as to vary hxE i in the\nrange 0.702 \u00b1 0.008 [28], and repeating the fit. The largest of the variations observed using the\nfragmentation functions of Peterson, Collins and Spiller, Kartvelishvili and the Lund group [27]\nwere taken as systematic errors.\nD0 decay multiplicities: The signal reconstruction efficiency and vertex charge distributions are\nsensitive to the B0 decay multiplicity, which depends only on the D0 decay for the B0 decay\nchannels of interest. The systematic error was assessed by varying separately the D0 charged\nand \u03c0 0 decay multiplicities in Monte Carlo simulation according to the measurements of Mark\nIII [29]. The branching ratio D0 \u2192 K0 , K\u03040 was also varied according to its uncertainty [18].\nThe resulting uncertainties on F(1)|Vcb | and \u03c12 from each variation were added in quadrature\nto determine the total systematic errors.\n\n\f14\n\n\u03c9 reconstruction: The modelling of the \u03c9 resolution depends on the description of the D\u2217+ and\nB0 energy and angular distributions in the simulation. The reconstructed D\u2217+ and B0 energy\ndistributions in data and simulation were compared, and the means were found to differ by 0.04\nand 0.13 GeV respectively. The opposite hemisphere missing energy was found to agree within\n5 %. The corresponding systematics were assessed by shifting or scaling the data distributions\nand repeating the \u03c9 reconstruction and fit. The modelling of the angular resolution was checked\nby studying the agreement of the two angular estimators-the slow pion and D0 directions for\nthe the D\u2217+ , and the missing energy vector and vertex flight directions for the B0 . The angular\nresolutions were found to be up to 5 % worse in data, and the systematic error was assessed\nby degrading the simulated resolution appropriately. Finally, the fraction of events with \u03c9\nreconstructed in the physical region (\u03c9 < \u03c9max ) was found to be 3.5 % smaller in the data, in\nboth opposite and same sign charge samples. The reconstruction efficiency was corrected for\nthis effect, and an additional systematic error of half the correction (1.7 %) assumed. The final\nsystematic errors due to \u03c9 resolution modelling are dominated by the B0 \u03b8 resolution.\nLepton identification efficiency: The electron identification efficiency has been studied using control samples of pure electrons from e+ e\u2212 \u2192 e+ e\u2212 events and photon conversions, and found to be\nmodelled to a a precision of 4.1 % [14]. The muon identification efficiency has been studied using\nmuon pairs producted in two-photon collisions and Z0 \u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 events, giving an uncertainty of\n2.1 % [30].\nVertex tag efficiency: The fraction of hemispheres with identified leptons which also had a selected\nsecondary vertex was found to be about 4 % less in data than in simulation. The overall fraction\nof vertex tagged hemispheres was also found to be about 4 % lower in data. These discrepancies\nwere translated into systematic errors on the efficiency to tag a semileptonic b decay with a\nsecondary vertex in either the same or the opposite hemisphere, in each case attributing the\nwhole discrepancy to a mismodelling of b hadron decays. The resulting errors on the same and\nopposite hemisphere tagging efficiencies were taken to be fully correlated.\nTrack reconstruction efficiency: The overall track reconstruction efficiency is known to be modelled to a precision of 1 % [14], and a similar uncertainty was found to be appropriate for the\nparticular class of slow pion tracks from D\u2217+ decays. The systematic error was assessed by\nrandomly removing 1 % of tracks in the simulation and repeating the fit.\nTracking resolution: Uncertainties in the tracking detector resolution affect the efficiency, \u03c9 reconstruction and vertex charge distributions. The associated error was assessed in the simulation\nby applying a global 10 % degradation to all tracks, independently in the r-\u03c6 and r-z planes, as\nin [14].\nFit method: The entire fitting procedure was tested on a fully simulated Monte Carlo sample seven\ntimes bigger than the data, with true values of F(1)|Vcb | = 32.5 \u00d7 10\u22123 and \u03c12 = 1.3. The fit\ngave the results F(1)|Vcb | = (31.8 \u00b1 0.5) \u00d7 10\u22123 and \u03c12 = 1.25 \u00b1 0.07, consistent with the true\nvalues. For each variable, the larger of the deviation of the result from the true value and the\nstatistical error were taken as a systematic errors due to possible biases in the fit. Additionally,\nthe large Monte Carlo sample was reweighted to change the values of F(1)|Vcb | and \u03c12 , and\nthe fit correctly recovered the modified values. To verify the correctness of the statistical errors\nreturned by the fit, it was performed on many separate subsamples, and the distribution of fitted\nresults studied. Further checks on the data included performing the analysis separately for B0\ndecays involving electrons and muons, dividing the sample according to the year of data taking,\nand varying the lepton transverse momentum cut. In all cases, consistent results were obtained.\nIncluding all systematic uncertaintities, the final result of the inclusive analysis is\nF(1)|Vcb | = (37.5 \u00b1 1.2 \u00b1 2.5) \u00d7 10\u22123 ,\n\n\f15\n\n\u03c12 = 1.12 \u00b1 0.14 \u00b1 0.29,\nwhere the first error is statistical and the second systematic in each case.\n\n6\n\nMeasurement using exclusively reconstructed D\u2217+ decays\n\nIn this analysis, the D0 from the B\u03040 \u2192 D\u2217+ l\u2212 \u03bd\u0304, D\u2217+ \u2192 D0 \u03c0 + decay is reconstructed exclusively\nin the decay modes D0 \u2192 K\u2212 \u03c0 + ('3-prong') and D0 \u2192 K\u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 0 ('satellite'-where the \u03c0 0 is not\nreconstructed). The event selection, reconstruction and determination of \u03c9 are exactly the same as\ndescribed in [9]. The determination of the signal and background fractions, and the fit to extract\nF(1)|Vcb | and \u03c12 are performed as in [9], but have been updated using the improved form factor\nparameterisation [10], the updated input parameters given in Table 1 and the b \u2192 D\u2217\u2217 l\u03bd\u0304 decay\nmodel [23] discussed in Section 5.\nThe fit is performed on 814 3-prong and 1396 satellite candidates, of which 505 \u00b1 44 and 754 \u00b1 72\nare attributed to B\u03040 \u2192 D\u2217+ l\u2212 \u03bd\u0304 signal decays. The result of the fit is\nF(1)|Vcb | = (36.8 \u00b1 1.6 \u00b1 2.0) \u00d7 10\u22123 ,\n\u03c12 = 1.31 \u00b1 0.21 \u00b1 0.16 ,\nwhere again the first errors are statistical and the second systematic. The statistical correlation\nbetween F(1)|Vcb | and \u03c12 is 0.95. The distribution of reconstructed \u03c9 for selected candidates (both\n3-prong and satellite) is shown in Figure 4. The branching ratio Br(B\u03040 \u2192 D\u2217+ l\u2212 \u03bd\u0304) has also been\ndetermined to be\nBr(B\u03040 \u2192 D\u2217+ l\u2212 \u03bd\u0304) = (5.11 \u00b1 0.19 \u00b1 0.49) %.\nThe systematic errors arise from uncertainties in the background levels in the selected samples,\nas well as uncertainties in the Monte Carlo simulations. They have been evaluated following the\nprocedures described in [9], and are summarised in Table 3. The selection efficiency error includes\ncontributions from lepton identification efficiency, b fragmentation and detector resolution uncertanties, described in detail in [31]. The largest change with respect to the previous result is due to\nthe improved b \u2192 D\u2217\u2217 l\u03bd\u0304 modelling, with the suppression of this background at values of \u03c9 close to\none. This reduces the statistical error, the systematic uncertainty due to the rate of such decays, and\nshifts the central value of F(1)|Vcb | upwards as compared to [9].\n\n7\n\nConclusions\n\nThe CKM matrix element |Vcb | has been measured by studying the rate of the semileptonic decay\nB\u03040 \u2192 D\u2217+ l\u2212 \u03bd\u0304 as a function of the recoil kinematics of both inclusively and exclusively reconstructed\nD\u2217+ mesons. The two results are combined, taking into account the statistical correlation of 18 % and\ncorrelated systematic errors from physics inputs and detector resolution. The results are:\nF(1)|Vcb | = (37.1 \u00b1 1.0 \u00b1 2.0) \u00d7 10\u22123 ,\n\u03c12 = 1.21 \u00b1 0.12 \u00b1 0.20 ,\nBr(B\u03040 \u2192 D\u2217+ l\u2212 \u03bd\u0304) = (5.26 \u00b1 0.20 \u00b1 0.46) % ,\nwhere the first result is statistical and the second systematic in each case. The statistical and systematic correlations between F(1)|Vcb | and \u03c12 are 0.90 and 0.54 respectively. These results supersede\nour previous publication [9]. They are consistent with other determinations of F(1)|Vcb | at LEP [7, 8]\nand the \u03a5(4S) resonance [6]. The branching ratio is consistent with the world average result of\n(4.60 \u00b1 0.27) % [18]. The result for F(1)|Vcb | is the most precise to date from any single experiment.\n\n\fevents / 0.1\n\n16\n\n700\n\nOPAL data\nB \u2192D l\u03bd\n0\n\n600\n\n*+ -\n\nresonant bgd.\ncombinatorial bgd.\n\n500\n400\n300\n200\n100\n0\n\n1\n\n1.05 1.1 1.15 1.2 1.25 1.3 1.35 1.4 1.45 1.5\nreconstructed \u03c9\n\nFigure 4: Distribution of reconstructed \u03c9 for B\u03040 \u2192 D\u2217+ l\u2212 \u03bd\u0304 candidates in the exclusive analysis.
