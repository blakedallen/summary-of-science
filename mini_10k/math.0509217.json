Introduction\nIn the classical Minkowski problem in Rn+1 one wants to find a strictly\nconvex closed hypersurface M \u2282 Rn+1 such that its Gauss curvature K equals\na given function f defined in the normal space of M or equivalently defined\non S n\n(0.1)\n\nK |M = f (\u03bd).\n\nThe problem has been partially solved by Minkowski [13], Alexandrov [1],\nLewy [11], Nirenberg [14], and Pogorelov [15], and in full generality by Cheng\nand Yau [2].\nDate: August 3, 2018.\n2000 Mathematics Subject Classification. 35J60, 53C21, 53C44, 53C50, 58J05.\nKey words and phrases. Minkowski problem, hypersurfaces of prescribed curvature,\nWeingarten hypersurfaces.\n1\n\n\fMINKOWSKI TYPE PROBLEMS\n\n2\n\nInstead of prescribing the Gaussian curvature other curvature functions F\ncan be considered, i.e., one studies the problem\nF |M = f (\u03bd).\n\n(0.2)\n\nIf F is one of the symmetric polynomials Hk , 1 \u2264 k \u2264 n, this problem has\nrecently been solved by Guan and Guan [9]. They proved that (0.2) has a\nsolution, if f is invariant with respect to a fixed point free group of isometries\nof S n .\nIn this paper we consider the problem (0.2) for strictly convex hypersurfaces M \u2282 S n+1 and for curvature functions F the inverses of which are\nof class (K), see Section 1 or [8, Definition 1.3]. These F include all Hk ,\n1 \u2264 k \u2264 n, |A|2 , and also any symmetric, convex curvature function homogeneous of degree 1, cf. [7, Lemma 1.6].\nWe shall show in Section 2 that for any closed strictly convex hypersurface\nM \u2282 S n+1 there exists a Gauss map\nx \u2208 M \u2192 x\u0303 \u2208 M \u2217 ,\n\n(0.3)\n\nwhere M \u2217 is the polar set of M . M \u2217 is also strictly convex, as smooth as M ,\nand the Gauss map is a diffeomorphism.\nIf we consider M as an embedding in Rn+2 of codimension 2, so that\nthe tangent spaces Tx (M ) and Tx (S n+1 ) can be identified with subspaces of\nTx (Rn+2 ), then the image of the point x under the Gauss map is exactly the\nnormal vector \u03bd \u2208 Tx (S n+1 )\n(0.4)\n\nx\u0303 = \u03bd \u2208 Tx (S n+1 ) \u2282 Tx (Rn+2 ).\n\nThus, the equation (0.2) can also be written in the form\n(0.5)\n\n\u2200 x \u2208 M,\n\nF |M = f (x\u0303)\n\nwhere f is given as a function defined in S n+1 .\nWe shall also prove that (0.5) has a dual problem, namely,\n(0.6)\n\nF\u0303 |M \u2217 = f \u22121 (x\u0303)\n\n\u2200 x\u0303 \u2208 M \u2217 ,\n\nwhere F\u0303 is the inverse of F\n(0.7)\n\nF\u0303 (\u03bai ) =\n\n1\n.\nF (\u03ba\u22121\ni )\n\nIn the dual problem the curvature is not prescribed by a function defined\nin the normal space, but by a function defined on the hypersurface.\nBoth problems are equivalent, solving one also leads to a solution of the\ndual one; notice also that\n(0.8)\n\nM \u2217\u2217 = M\n\n\u2227\n\n \u0303 = x.\nx\u0303\n\nTo find a solution we either impose some symmetry requirement with\nrespect to a group of isometries or we assume the existence of barriers.\n\n\fMINKOWSKI TYPE PROBLEMS\n\n3\n\n0.1. Assumption. (i) Let G \u2282 O(n+2) be a group of orthogonal transformations with a common fixed point x0 \u2208 S n+1 and assume that the induced\ngroup of isometries in S n , i.e., the equator of the hemisphere with center in\nx0 , is fixed point free.\n(ii) Let 0 < f \u2208 C 5 (S n+1 ) be invariant with respect to the group G, i.e.,\n\n(0.9)\n\nf (Ax) = f (x)\n\n\u2200 x \u2208 S n+1 , \u2200 A \u2208 G.\n\nThen we shall prove\n0.2. Theorem. Let F \u2208 C 5 (\u0393+ ) be a symmetric, positively homogeneous\nand monotone curvature function such that its inverse F\u0303 is of class (K), then\nthe dual problems\n(0.10)\n\nF |M = f (x\u0303)\n\nand\n(0.11)\n\nF\u0303 |M \u2217 = f \u22121 (x\u0303)\n\nhave strictly convex solutions M resp. M \u2217 of class C 4,\u03b1 , 0 < \u03b1 < 1, such\nthat the hypersurfaces M resp. M \u2217 are invariant with respect to the group\nG. Furthermore, \u2212x0 is an interior point of the convex body M\u0302 and x0 an\ninterior point of the convex body M\u0302 \u2217 of M \u2217 . The convex bodies M\u0302 , M\u0302 \u2217\nare strictly contained in the corresponding open hemispheres H(\u2212x0 ) resp.\nH(x0 ).\nInstead of imposing some symmetry assumption, a barrier condition will\nalso work.\n0.3. Assumption. Let Mi , i = 1, 2, be strictly convex hypersurfaces of\nclass C 6,\u03b1 contained in an open hemisphere H(\u2212x0 ). M1 is said to be a lower\nbarrier for the pair (F, f ), if\n(0.12)\n\nF |M1 \u2264 f,\n\nand M2 is called an upper barrier for (F, f ), if\n(0.13)\n\nF |M2 \u2265 f,\n\nwhere in both cases the right-hand side f may either depend on x \u2208 Mi or\n\u03bd \u2208 Tx (S n+1 ) for x \u2208 Mi , or, in the latter case, equivalently on x\u0303 \u2208 Mi\u2217 .\n0.4. Theorem. Let F \u2208 C 5 (\u0393+ ) be a symmetric, positively homogeneous\nand monotone curvature function such that its inverse F\u0303 is of class (K), let\n0 < f \u2208 C 5 (S n+1 ), and assume that there exist upper and lower barriers for\n(F, f ) in the hemisphere H(\u2212x0 ) as defined in the Assumption 0.3, where in\naddition the barriers Mi should bound a connected open set \u03a9 such that the\nmean curvature vector of M1 should point to the exterior of \u03a9 and the mean\ncurvature vector of M2 should point into \u03a9. Then the dual problems\n(0.14)\n\nF |M = f (x\u0303)\n\n\fMINKOWSKI TYPE PROBLEMS\n\n4\n\nand\n(0.15)\n\nF\u0303 |M \u2217 = f \u22121 (x\u0303)\n\nhave strictly convex solutions M resp. M \u2217 of class C 6,\u03b1 , 0 < \u03b1 < 1, such\nthat the convex bodies M\u0302 , M\u0302 \u2217 are strictly contained in the open hemispheres\nH(\u2212x0 ) resp. H(x0 ).\nThe paper is organized as follows: Section 1 gives an overview of the\ndefinitions and conventions we rely on, while the dual relationship between\nM and M \u2217 and the properties of the Gauss map are derived in Section 2.\nThe curvature estimates are proved in Section 3, the lower order estimates\nin Section 4. The next two sections contain a uniqueness result for invariant convex hypersurfaces with constant F , and the existence proof in the\ninvariance case, which is based on a continuity method using Smale's infinite\ndimensional version of Sard's theorem [18]. Finally, in Section 7 we prove\nTheorem 0.4.\n0.5. Remark. Let us emphasize that after Section 2 we shall only consider\nequation (0.11). In order to simplify notation we then shall drop the tilde\nand the other embellishments and shall solve the equation\n(0.16)\n\nF |M = f (x)\n\nfor a curvature function F of class (K), where we note that we also replaced\nf \u22121 by f .\n1. Notations and definitions\nThe main objective of this section is to state the equations of Gauss, Codazzi, and Weingarten for hypersurfaces M in a (n+1)-dimensional Riemannian manifold N . Geometric quantities in N will be denoted by (\u1e21\u03b1\u03b2 ), (R\u0304\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3\u03b4 ),\netc., and those in M by (gij ), (Rijkl ), etc. Greek indices range from 0 to n\nand Latin from 1 to n; the summation convention is always used. Generic\ncoordinate systems in N resp. M will be denoted by (x\u03b1 ) resp. (\u03be i ). Covariant differentiation will simply be indicated by indices, only in case of possible\nambiguity they will be preceded by a semicolon, i.e., for a function u in N ,\n(u\u03b1 ) will be the gradient and (u\u03b1\u03b2 ) the Hessian, but e.g., the covariant derivative of the curvature tensor will be abbreviated by R\u0304\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3\u03b4;\u01eb . We also point\nout that\n(1.1)\n\nR\u0304\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3\u03b4;i = R\u0304\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3\u03b4;\u01eb x\u01ebi\n\nwith obvious generalizations to other quantities.\nLet M be a C 2 -hypersurface with normal \u03bd.\nIn local coordinates, (x\u03b1 ) and (\u03be i ), the geometric quantities of the hypersurface M are connected through the following equations\n(1.2)\n\n\u03b1\nx\u03b1\nij = \u2212hij \u03bd\n\n\fMINKOWSKI TYPE PROBLEMS\n\n5\n\nthe so-called Gauss formula. Here, and also in the sequel, a covariant derivative is always a full tensor, i.e.,\n\u03b1\nk \u03b1\n\u03b1 \u03b2 \u03b3\nx\u03b1\nij = x,ij \u2212 \u0393ij xk + \u0393\u0304\u03b2\u03b3 xi xj .\n\n(1.3)\n\nThe comma indicates ordinary partial derivatives.\nIn this implicit definition the second fundamental form (hij ) is taken with\nrespect to \u2212\u03bd.\nThe second equation is the Weingarten equation\n\u03bdi\u03b1 = hki x\u03b1\nk,\n\n(1.4)\n\nwhere we remember that \u03bdi\u03b1 is a full tensor.\nFinally, we have the Codazzi equation\n(1.5)\n\nhij;k \u2212 hik;j = R\u0304\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3\u03b4 \u03bd \u03b1 x\u03b2i x\u03b3j x\u03b4k\n\nand the Gauss equation\n(1.6)\n\n\u03b2 \u03b3 \u03b4\nRijkl = {hik hjl \u2212 hil hjk } + R\u0304\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3\u03b4 x\u03b1\ni xj xk xl .\n\nWhen we consider hypersurfaces M \u2282 S n+1 to be embedded in Rn+2 ,\nwe label the coordinates in Rn+2 as (xa ), i.e., indices a, b, c, ... always run\nthrough n + 2 values either from 1 to n + 2 or from 0 to n + 1.\nLet us also state the definition of curvature functions of class (K)\n1.1. Definition. A symmetric curvature function F \u2208 C 2,\u03b1 (\u0393+ ) \u2229 C 0 (\u0393\u0304+ )\npositively homogeneous of degree d0 > 0 is said to be of class (K) if\n\u2202F\n(1.7)\nFi =\n> 0 in \u0393+ ,\n\u2202\u03bai\n(1.8)\n\nF|\u2202\u0393+ = 0,\n\nand\n(1.9)\n\nF ij,kl \u03b7ij \u03b7kl \u2264 F \u22121 (F ij \u03b7ij )2 \u2212 F ik h\u0303jl \u03b7ij \u03b7kl\n\n\u2200 \u03b7 \u2208 S,\n\nor, equivalently, if we set F\u0302 = log F ,\n(1.10)\n\nF\u0302 ij,kl \u03b7ij \u03b7kl \u2264 \u2212F\u0302 ik h\u0303jl \u03b7ij \u03b7kl\n\nwhere F is evaluated at (hij ).\n\n\u2200 \u03b7 \u2208 S,\n\nA detailed analysis of these curvature functions can be found in [8, Section\n1].

M2 are lower resp. upper barriers for (F, f )\nbounding a connected open set \u03a9 \u2282 H(x0 ).\nWe want to apply an old result, [7, Theorem 0.4], in which we showed\nthat the problem (7.1) has a strictly convex solution M \u2282 \u03a9\u0304 of class C 6,\u03b1\nassuming that F is of class (K), homogeneous of degree 1, and concave.\nIn addition there should exist a strictly convex function \u03c8 \u2208 C 2 (\u03a9\u0304). The\nambient space was an arbitrary Riemannian manifold N , \u03a9\u0304 was supposed to\nbe compact, and should be covered by a normal Gaussian coordinate system\n(x\u03b1 ).\nAll hypotheses are satisfied in the present situation: \u03a9\u0304 is compact, the\nnormal Gaussian coordinate system is given by choosing geodesic polar coordinates with center in x0 , the strictly convex function \u03c8 can be defined\nby\n(7.2)\n\n\u03c8 = 12 |x0 |2 ,\n\nwhere x0 is the radial distance to x0 , as one easily checks observing that the\nlevel hypersurfaces {x0 = const} which intersect \u03a9\u0304 are all uniformly strictly\nconvex, and F is homogeneous of degree 1 and therefore also concave.\n\n\fMINKOWSKI TYPE PROBLEMS\n\n30\n\nReferences\n[1] A.D.
