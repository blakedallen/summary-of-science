In the last decades, numerous approaches to\nsolve the problem of SR have been proposed in the literature [1].\nBetween these, Bayesian Maximum a Posteriori (MAP)\nmethods [2] have gained wide acceptance due to their\nrobustness and flexibility to incorporate a priori constraints,\nalthough they are usually affected by high computational\nburdens. MAP methods attempt to solve the SR problem in a\nsingle step, by a complex, iterative procedure.\nMore computationally-efficient SR methods could be\ndevised [1] by splitting the HR image reconstruction task into\nThis work was supported by the Spanish Ministry of Education\nand Science under TIN 2007-65989 and CAM S-SEM-02552006, and by COINCIDENTE project DN8644, RESTAURAC.\n\ntwo simpler steps, which are carried out sequentially. The firststep is devoted to increase the sampling rate of the incoming LR\nimages, by regression or scattered-point interpolation on\nsequence pixels, after projection onto the HR frame. The aim of\nthe second step is to restore the degradations associated to the\nlarge integration area of the LR sequence pixels, combined with\nartifacts introduced by the previous processing scheme (residual\nregistration and interpolation errors) or degradations linked to\nthe image acquisition process (defocusing, atmospheric and\nmotion blur, etc). These two-step methods generally trade some\nloss in quality or flexibility for a lower computational\ncomplexity that leads to faster execution times.\nIn previous papers [3-4], the authors presented a simple\nlearning-based SR method capable of providing results of\nquality similar to standard MAP methods when operating on\nrelatively long sequences of 25 images (corresponding to a 1 s\nsequence in the PAL video standard). A comparison of this\nmethod to a state-of-the art SR algorithm was reported in [5]. In\nthis paper, it is presented a novel two-step method with a\nsignificantly improved interpolation step, which makes use of\nsub-pixel image statistics. This enables effective application of\nthe SR method to very short image sequences, which is relevant\nnot only from a theoretical, but also from a practical point of\nview. The fields of application in which fairly short sequences\nare typically only the ones available are numerous, ranging from\nneuroscience to astronomy, or applications related to\nsurveillance and satellite image processing.\nThe paper is organized as follows. The observation model\nis briefly described in section 2. In section 3 are introduced the\ntwo steps of the proposed SR reconstruction method, together\nwith the previous sub-pixel registration step. Experimental\nresults are reported in section 4. Finally, section 5 concludes the\npaper.\n\n2.\n\nOBSERVATION MODEL\n\nAccurate estimates of the data provided by an imaging sensor\nare required at several stages of the learning phase of the\nalgorithm proposed. Firstly, LR image patches sampled at subpixel resolution are required to derive the Principal Components\n(PC) used in the interpolation step of the algorithm. Secondly,\nthe coefficients of the linear restoration filter used in the last\nstep are fitted to minimize the mean square error (MSE)\nbetween HR reconstructed pixels, obtained by application of the\ninterpolation-restoration paradigm on simulated LR sequences,\nand the goal HR values, derived by use of the observation model\nat the desired increase in resolution for the SR process.\nImage patches at different levels of resolution are\ngenerated synthetically from a set of reference images, taken to\n\n\frepresent a very high-resolution approximation of a continuous,\ndegradation-free image. Using these images, the output of an\nimaging sensor of a given (lower) resolution could be simulated\nby adequate blurring, down-sampling and noise addition\noperations. Specifically, the following processing steps are\nsequentially applied to a reference image to obtain a simulated\npicture at a given resolution: a) filtering with the lens optical\ndiffraction-limited transfer function (OTF); b) filtering with the\nShannon empirical OTF formula, to account for symmetric\naberrations in the optics; c) filtering with the detector OTF; d)\ndown-sampling to the sensor resolution and e) addition of\nGaussian noise. Details and mathematical expressions for the\nabove mentioned OTF's could be found, for instance, in [6].\nFigure 1 shows a comparison of the actual image (left)\nprovided by a CCD camera when imaging the inner part of the\n1951 USAF resolution test chart and the image (right) estimated\nby application of our observation model (with the actual camera\nparameters) to a digitized version of the resolution chart,\nobtained by use of a high-resolution flat-bed scanner. The visual\nagreement between both images is excellent, as the model\nsucceeds in reproducing accurately the aliasing effects and the\nfrequency-dependent lost of contrast in the bars, apparent in the\nCCD image.\n\nFig. 1. left: image obtained from a CCD camera; right:\nestimated image, computed using the observation model\n3. SUPER-RESOLUTION METHOD\nThe method proposed follows the pattern of two-step SR\nmethods, with a first step of scattered point-interpolation of\nsequence pixels, followed by a restoration to correct for the LR\npixel size and residual errors introduced by the interpolation\nprocedure. Operation of the method requires previous\napplication of a registration step, to obtain the geometric\ntransform coefficients between input frames that will enable\nsequence pixels projection onto the HR image frame.\n\n3.1. Step 0: sub-pixel registration\nThis step is performed by application of a classical registration\nalgorithm, capable of providing the geometric transformation\ncoefficients between two images of the same scene with\naccuracy higher than the pixel size. Several motion models\nbetween frames of the input sequence were considered, ranging\nfrom pure translations to affine and planar projective transforms.\nMotion models up to affine were processed by suitable versions\nof the Irani-Peleg sub-pixel registration algorithm [7], with the\nextension to affine transformations presented in [3]. Fitting of\nthe 8-dimensional planar projective model is performed by\napplication of the Mann-Picard method [8].\n\n3.2. Step 1: scattered-point interpolation using PC\nUsing the geometric mappings between frames determined in\nthe previous step, sequence pixels are projected onto the HR\nframe (aligned to one of the sequence frames), and the LR\nimage values at the nodes of the HR grid are estimated from\nneighboring projected pixels. A diagram of the process is\npresented in figure 2.\n\nFig. 2. sequence projection process: a) sequence pixels; b) projection onto the HR grid; c) data used to estimate a HR pixel (X)\nOne possible approach to solve this estimation problem is to use\nthe projected data to fit local image models, which are\nsubsequently applied to generate new image values at the HR\ngrid nodes. In this approach, it stands as natural the use of\nmodels based on the principal components (PC) of the image at\na local scale, as they will yield minimal representational error\n(in terms of mean squared error, MSE) for a given\ndimensionality of the model [9]. A preliminary study, based on\nthe use of polynomial models, is reported in [10].\nFor this purpose, we have determined the PC of image\npatches of 64 x 64 pixels, spanning 4 x 4 pixels of a LR image.\nThe densely sampled patches required have been generated by\napplication of the observation model to samples of the reference\nimage set, with appropriate blurring and downscaling\nparameters. Results obtained are in excellent agreement with\nthose previously reported [11, 12] for the PC of local patches of\nnatural images, in spite of the fact that, in our case, reference\nimages are constituted by HR satellite images of urban scenes\n[3], and sub-pixel data is generated using an observation model.\nInside an image patch of size 4 x 4 LR pixels, the image\nstructure at sub-pixel level has been modeled as a linear\ncombination of continuous functions obtained by smooth bicubic interpolation of the first 60 PC. Coefficients of the linear\ncombination (aj) have been determined by minimization of the\nMSE between model predictions and the projected sequence\npixel values in the neighborhood:\n2\n\n\u239e\n1 \u239b\nE = \u2211 \u239c\u239c zi \u2212 \u2211 a j f PCj ( xi , yi ) \u239f\u239f ,\n2 i \u239d\nj\n\u23a0\n\n(1)\n\nwhere E is the model prediction error, zi the i pixel value with\nprojected coordinates (xi, yi) and fPCj is the continuous function\nobtained by interpolation of the jth PC.\nSolution of this general linear least square problem\nrequires a matrix inversion which has been performed using\nsingular value decomposition, SVD [13]. The use of SVD\nimproves robustness when the problem is close to singular, due,\n\n\ffor instance, to an inadequate model order selection in an image\npatch, or induced by a large image noise level.\nLocal model representations centered in the nodes of a\ngrid with a spacing of 2 LR pixel size have been computed,\ncovering the complete extension of the HR image to be\nreconstructed. Taking into account the 4 x 4 pixel size of the\nlocal representation, this provides an area overlap of 1/2\nbetween neighboring models, improving continuity at the model\nboundaries. Residual continuity errors are reduced to a\nnegligible level by application of a conjugate gradient descent\noptimization process [13] on the space of PC coefficients.\n\na)\n\nc)\n\nb)\n\nd)\n\nFig. 3. Results of the interpolation step for two-step methods\n(see text)\n\n3.3. Step 2: learning-based image restoration\nFollowing the approach described in [3], the restoration step is\nperformed by application of a rotationally symmetric linear\nfilter in the spatial domain. Filter coefficients are determined by\nminimizing MSE between restoration of step one interpolated\nimages and goal HR image values. This process implicitly\nconsiders residual degradations caused by interpolation,\neffectively coupling both steps of the super-resolution method.\n\n4. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS\nThe SR images obtained by application of the proposed SR\nmethod have been compared with excellent results to those\nprovided by several state-of-the-art SR algorithms, including\none and two-step HR image reconstruction procedures, on a\nvariety of acquired sequences of different kind. Due to space\nconstraints, we present here results on a single sequence,\nconsisting of five frames depicting a map of Madrid's suburban\nrail network, digitized using a flat-bed scanner operating at low\nresolution (200 dpi), with small, uncontrolled specimen motions\nbetween acquisitions. This sequence is particularly suitable to\nspot the variations in performance of the different methods, due\nto the presence of a large amount of details of different type\n\n(points, lines, text), all highly-contrasted in the original. The\nresults presented for methods other than those developed by the\nauthors were obtained using the MDSP Resolution Enhancement\nSoftware [14], which integrates several state-of-the-art SR\nalgorithms. Method's internal parameters, in all cases, have\nbeen set to the default values included in the SW.\nIn figure 3 are presented the results of the first step of the\nreconstruction (i.e. interpolation) for some of the two-step\nmethods under comparison. In panel a) is presented, for\nreference, the results obtained with a cubic spline interpolation\nof a single frame. As is apparent, text remains clearly underresolved and jaggedness, due to aliasing, is notorious in the\ngraphic lines. All SR interpolation methods tested showed\nsignificant improvements with respect to this control image. In\nb) are presented the results obtained with the 'Shift and Add'\n(S&A) method, as described in [15], with an additional\npreprocessing outlier detection/removal algorithm using a\nbilateral filter [16]. Despite the increase in resolution with\nrespect to the cubic spline interpolated image, jaggedness in\ndiagonal lines is still apparent, text is still not fully resolved and\nis affected at some degree by impulse noise. Results with a\nmedian S&A method [17] are for this sequence visually similar\nto those displayed in b). In panel c) are presented the results\nobtained with the SR interpolation method described in [3]. As\nexpected, the use of distance-dependent interpolation functions\nwith sparse projected sequence data produces a blocky\nappearance in the details, with small-scale discontinuities in the\ngraphic lines. Finally, the results of the proposed PCA-based\ninterpolation are displayed in d). As could be observed, the\nmethod provides excellent results both in terms of resolution\nincrease and absence of image artifacts (line jaggedness,\nregularity of details). Residual continuity errors at boundaries of\nlocal PC models are undetectable by visual inspection, event\nafter the restoration performed in the second step of the\nreconstruction method.\nIn figure 4 are presented the results of the global HR\nreconstruction process for our method, together with those of\nseveral state-of-the-art methods being compared. In a) are\npresented the results of applying the bilateral S&A method\nfollowed by a Lucy deconvolution. This restoration step\nincreases here significantly the irregularities present in the\ninterpolation result, with noticeable artifacts in lines and text. In\nspite of this action, text remains to some extent under-resolved.\nBetter results in terms of details resolution, but still with a\nsomewhat high level of artifacts, are obtained by application of\nan S&A method with iterative deblurring, panel b). This method\n[17] applies the S&A step, performing afterwards the\ninterpolation and deblurring operations in a single step, using a\nL2 (Tikhonov) regularization term. In c) and d) are presented the\nresults of applying two state-of-the-art maximum likelihood\n(ML) type methods using regularization terms based,\nrespectively, in L1 (Bilateral TV) and L2 (Tikhonov) measures.\nThe L1 method [17], panel c), provides here noticeably clean\nresults in low-complexity areas, at the cost of a perceptible\ndegradation of small details, especially text, which present a\nwashed-out appearance. Better results have been obtained with\nthe L2 method [18], in panel d), but some irregularities in lines\nand text are still noticeable. In e) are presented the results\nobtained with the two-step SR method described in [3]. The\nquality of the restoration step, consisting of an optimal linear\nfiltering process with pre-defined coefficients, is affected by the\n\n\fartifacts introduced by the interpolation step, with noticeable\ndistortions in some texts, even if lines have more regular\nappearance than in other methods. Finally, in f) are presented\nthe results of the proposed method, with perhaps the most\nsuccessful balance between resolution increase and regularity of\nresults.\n\n6. REFERENCES\n[1] S.C.

CONCLUSIONS\nIn this paper, we presented a novel two-step super-resolution\nalgorithm, with a robust scattered-point interpolation step well\nsuited to solve the specially demanding problem of obtaining SR\nestimates from short image sequences. The results provided by\nthe method are excellent in comparison not only to other twostep SR methods but also to state-of-the-art MAP-type\nalgorithms. This indicates that the potential shortcomings of two\nstep methods, due to the decoupling of interpolation and\nrestoration operations, may be overcome by an adequate, datadriven definition of the operations to be performed in both steps\nof the method. In view of the results obtained, this might remain\nvalid even for specially demanding scenarios, such as the SR\nreconstruction from short image sequences.\n\n[12] G.
