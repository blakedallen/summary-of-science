This is largely because of the liquid's\natomic nature, implying relatively few microscopic internal degrees of freedom.1 Despite this fact, the experimental study of these systems has long been confounded\nby the difficulty in reproducibly generating and transporting ions of known identity while controlling for the\neffects of impurity ions. Accordingly, there have been\nrelatively few transport studies for ions in the liquefied\nnoble gases other than LHe reported in the literature to\ndate. Furthermore, studies that deal only with molecular\nions,1,2,3,4,5 are more common than those that deal with\nmonatomic species.6,7 There is therefore a clear need for\nadditional data on monatomic ion transport particularly\nin the heavy noble gases. In the present work we consider\nthe system of monatomic Th ions in LXe.\nThis research also has important applications to the\nphysics of ionizing particle detectors, especially in the\narea of rare event searches that use a liquefied noble\ngas as the detection medium.8,9,10 For these systems, the\ntransport properties of Th and U ions are of concern because these elements in trace amounts represent a large\nsource of background radioactivity. It is therefore desirable to understand how electric fields might be used\nto draw these ions out of the detection medium.10 For\nLXe-based detectors, Cs and Ba ions are also interesting because their respective separation from the detection medium and subsequent identification can greatly\nenhance the sensitivity to solar neutrinos and to doublebeta decay.8,9 The motivation for the present study is\nwork involving Ba ion retrieval from LXe as part of R&D\nfor a large double-beta decay experiment.11\nIn this paper, we report on the measurement of the\nmobility of 226 Th ions in liquid Xe at 163.0 K and 0.9\nbar pressure. We also compare our results and those of\n\nother workers with the theoretical calculations of Hilt,\nSchmidt and Khrapak.2\n\nII.\n\nEXPERIMENT\n\nOur system, schematically shown in Fig. 1, consists of\na vacuum-insulated cell which we fill with about 10 cm3 of\nLXe.The cell is cooled by a cold finger that forms a thermal link with a liquid nitrogen reservoir. The temperature is maintained at 163.0\u00b10.1 K by a resistive heater.\nThe cell, built almost entirely out of UHV-compatible\nmaterials, is baked at 400 K for several days, after which\nit is pumped to a 7.0\u00d710\u22128 mbar vacuum by means\nof two turbomolecular pumps. When filling the cell, we\npass research-grade Xe (which, as supplied, is quoted as\n99.999% pure) through a hot Zr getter,12 which is rated\nto remove reactive impurities to the <1 ppb level. These\nprecautions are taken to minimize any effect of impurities that might influence ion transport characteristics.\nTh ions are produced by a 230 U source mounted\ninside the cell.\nThe 230 U was obtained as a de230\ncay product of\nPa, in turn produced in the re230\naction 232\nTh+p\u2192\n90\n91 Pa+3n on natural thorium at a\ncyclotron.13 After irradiation, the 230 Pa was left to \u03b2decay for a few of its 17.4 day half lives, allowing some\nbuild-up of 230 U, which was then chemically separated\nand electroplated onto a platinum disk. Fig. 2 shows the\ndecay scheme for the final 230 U source.\n226\nTh ions are formed as a result of the 20.8 day \u03b1\ndecay of 230 U. The average recoil energy of \u223c100 keV extracts 226 Th atoms from the surface in a highly ionized\nstate. As the 226 Th ion enters the liquid it exchanges\ncharge with the surrounding Xe atoms and reaches equilibrium in some final charge state. Although the energetics of the charge exchange in principle favor a final state\ncontaining Xe+ and Th+ (Ref. 6), a large number of the\n\n\f2\n\n230\nU(20.8 d)\n\u2720\u2701\n\u27015.89 MeV\u03b1 70%\n\u2701\u261b\n\n5.82 MeV\u03b1 30%\n\n226\nTh(30.6 m)\n\u2720\u2701\n\u27016.34 MeV\u03b1 76%\n\u2701\u261b\n\n6.23 MeV\u03b1 23%\n\n6.56 MeV\u03b1 \u2701\n\n7.13 MeV\u03b1 \u2701\n\n7.69 MeV\u03b1 \u2701\n\n\u2701\n\u2701\u261b\n\n214\n\n\u2701\n\u2701\u261b \u2212\n210\nPb(22.3 y)\u2748\u2772\u03b2\n210\n\nBi(5.01 d)\u2748\u2772\u03b2\n\n\u2701\n\u2701\u261b\n\n218\n\n222\n\nRa(38 s)\n\nRn(35 ms)\n\nPo(164 \u03bcs)\n\n\u2212\n\n\u2701 210 Po(138.4 d)\n\u2701\n\u2701\u261b\n\n5.30 MeV\u03b1\n206\n\nPb(stable)\n\nFIG. 2: Decay scheme for 230 U. Decays with branching ratios\nless than 5% are not shown.\n\nFIG. 1: Schematic of the probe cell.\n\nemerging Th ions can also recombine with free ionization\nelectrons that arise from the original \u03b1 decay.6 This effect\npresents a major problem as it greatly suppresses the ion\nyield.\nWe collect ions on a stainless steel probe which we\nlower into the liquid. To collect ions we place the probe\nat ground potential while applying a positive bias to the\nsource electrode. The tip of the probe is fashioned into\na 5 mm \u00d7 16 mm, 2 mm thick rectangular stainless steel\nplate, ensuring a spatially uniform electric field in the\nvicinity of the source. The uniformity of the field is verified by constructing a computer model of the electrostatics with the MAXWELL software package.14\nThe ions that land on the probe are detected by retracting the probe vertically to a counting station, located above the liquid surface. It consists of a 50 mm2\nactive area ion-implanted Si detector15 that is read out\nusing standard pre- and post-amplification electronics.\nThe ion yield is determined by counting the \u03b1 particles\nemitted in the 30.6 min 226 Th decay, along with those\nproduced by the subsequent \u03b1 decays of 222 Ra, 218 Rn,\nand 214 Po (see Fig. 2).\nIt should be pointed out that in addition to the 226 Th\n\nions, the 230 U source also produces ions arising from the\nother \u03b1 decays in the chain. These can also drift to the\nprobe and be detected at the counting station. However, because of their considerably shorter lifetimes, they\npresent a negligible background to the 226 Th signal provided some short time elapses between the probe extraction and the counting. In addition, the low angular acceptance of our \u03b1 particle detection system (\u223c5%) ensures that the probability of detecting more than one \u03b1\nparticle from the 4-\u03b1 decay sequence of a given Th atom\nis negligibly small.\nWe measure the ion mobility in liquid Xe by determining the ion transit time from source to probe at a\ngiven probe distance and electric field. This is achieved\nby biasing the source with an alternating potential produced by a computer driving a high voltage amplifier.16\nThe system is set to produce a square wave switching between Vdrif t and Vsup with respect to the probe, where\nVdrif t can be varied from 1.0 kV to 4.0 kV, and Vsup is\nfixed at -4.0 kV. Vdrif t is set for a time tdrif t \u2248 1 s, very\nlong compared to the \u223c20 \u03bcs switching time of the high\nvoltage system. During each full cycle, the voltage is reversed for a time tsup . When this occurs, the ions that do\nnot reach the probe during tdrif t are drawn back towards\nthe source. This occurs when tdrif t is too short for the\nions to complete the journey to the probe. We maximize\nour total ion integration time by having tsup \u2264 tdrif t and\n|Vdrif t | < |Vsup |.6 During each data taking run, Vdrif t is\nset to a particular value and the field is switched for 1800\ns. The constant duration of collection runs ensures that\nthe amount of ion loss due to radioactive decay during\ncollection is uniform. We then measure the ion yield at\nthe counting station over a period of 2 hours to allow sufficient time for the collected 226 Th ions to decay before\n\n\f3\n\n(a)\n\nCounts per 5 keV bin\n\n450\n\n218\n\n| Rn\n\n400\n350\n\n222\n\n| Ra\n\n300\n\n226\n\n| Th\n\n214\n\n|\n\n250\n\nPo\n\n230\n\n| U\n\n200\n150\n100\n50\n0\n5\n\n5.5\n\n6\n\n6.5\n\n7\n\n7.5\n\n8\n\n8.5\n\nEnergy (MeV)\n3\n\n\u00d710\n2.4\n\nCounts per 25 keV bin\n\n2.2\n\n(b)\n\n222\n\n| Ra\n\n2\n1.8\n\n226\n\n218\n\n| Th\n\n1.6\n\n| Rn\n\n214\n\n|\n\nPo\n\n1.4\n1.2\n1\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0\n5\n\n5.5\n\n6\n\n6.5\n\n7\n\n7.5\n\n8\n\n8.5\n\nEnergy (MeV)\n\n500\n\n(c)\n2\n\n\u03c7 / ndf = 99.68 / 96\n\n450\n\nCounts per 20 s\n\nthe next run. Data are taken at four different electric\nfields, using four source-probe voltages and two sourceprobe separation distances.\nWe determine the background by performing 2-hour\ncounts between data runs in which no ions are collected.\nIn these runs the source-probe voltage remains reversebiased. The observed rate during the background runs is\naveraged over all runs, giving the mean background rate\nand an associated statistical error. The resulting value of\n3.16\u00b10.73 counts per 2-hour run is subtracted from the\nnumber of counts observed at each tdrif t . When ions are\ncollected, the typical rate is \u223c30 counts per run. Sources\nof background include cosmic rays and neutral Th atoms\nthat evaporate from the surface of the liquid and diffuse\nthrough the gas.\nFor the purpose of characterizing the system a test in\nXe gas was also done. The cell was filled with 0.2 bar\nof room-temperature Xe gas and the probe was alternately brought close to the 230 U source and raised to the\ncounting station, where ions were respectively collected\nand counted. This was repeated many times over several\nhours to build up counting statistics. The electric field\nbetween source and probe for ion collection was roughly\n\u223c200 V/cm for this test.

The best fit is the superposition of two\nexponentials with half-lives of 1826\u00b1106.7 s and 38.2\u00b12.97 s.\nThese match the 226 Th and 222 Ra half-lives, whose published\nvalues are 1830 s and 38 s respectively.19\n\nShown in Fig. 4 are plots of the ion yield vs tdrif t . For\neach data point, the ion yield is determined by dividing\nthe number of detected \u03b1 particle counts by the number of cycles, giving the ion yield per cycle. The average\nbackground in these units is \u22640.002, and the statistical\nerror bounds on each data point were computed using\nthe Feldman-Cousins prescription.18 We find that the ion\nyield is consistent with zero (after background subtraction) when tdrif t is short, while at longer times, the ion\nyield per cycle increases linearly with tdrif t . The abscissa\nof the join point between these two behaviors is the ion\ntransit time. We fit the ion yield data to the following\ntwo-parameter piecewise linear function,\nY = 0\nY = m(tdrif t \u2212 ttr )\n\ntdrif t < ttr\ntdrif t \u2265 ttr\n\nwhere Y is the ion yield per cycle, m is the slope (ion\nyield per cycle per unit tdrif t ), and ttr is the ion transit time. The value of ttr yielded by the fit is used to\ncalculate the ion drift velocity. To perform the fits, and\nto calculate the statistical error on ttr in each case, we\nuse an algorithm due to D.J.

One peculiarity of such a fit is\nthat the error bounds are almost always asymmetric.20\nThe results of the fits are summarized in Table I.\nFig. 5 shows a plot of the computed ion drift velocity as a function of electric field. The data are consistent with the linear relation v = \u03bcE, where v is the ion\ndrift speed, \u03bc is the mobility, and E is the electric field.\nFrom a fit to the data in Fig. 5 we find an ion mobil-\n\nity \u03bc =0.240\u00b10.011 cm2 /(kV-s). This fit is obtained by\nforcing the straight line to go through the origin and it\nyields \u03c72 /ndf=2.02/3.A fit not constrained to go through\nthe origin results in \u03bc = 0.268 \u00b1 0.031 cm2 /(kV-s), a\ny-intercept of -0.095\u00b10.088 cm/s, and \u03c72 /ndf=1.14/3.\nThis is fully consistent with the original result.\nThe mobility and its statistical error are determined\nlargely by the data taken at the lowest electric field. This\npoint is more precise for two reasons. First, the ion transit time at this electric field is the longest of the four\ndatasets, meaning that the fractional error on the velocity is the smallest. Secondly, in this dataset the ion\ntransit time happens to be within \u223c0.01 seconds of the\nnearest tdrif t at which we collected data, and this results\nin a precise measurement. While, in principle, better accuracy could be obtained by repeating the measurements\nand always taking a point near this optimal time, the 20.8\nday half life of the 230 U source makes it impractical to\nrepeat the entire experiment. It is also true that the data\nfrom which the first point is determined was recorded earlier in the lifetime of the 230 U source, resulting in higher\nstatistics.\nSystematic uncertainties on the mobility derive from\n\n\f5\nTABLE II: Ion mobilities in LXe, comparing a model due to\nHilt, Schmidt and Khrapak (HSK)2 to the experimental data.\n\n2\n2\n\nIon drift speed (cm/s)\n\n1.8\n1.6\n\n\u03c7 / ndf = 2.02 / 3\n\u03bc = 0.240\u00b1 0.011 kV/cm-s\n\nIon\n\nT (K)\n\nP (bar)\n\n163.0\n163.0\n168.0\n\n0.9\n0.9\n1.2\n\n1.4\n208\n\nTl+\nTh+\nBa+\n\n1.2\n\n226\n\n1\n0.8\n\na Ref.\n\n0.6\n\nb This\nc Ref.\n\n0.4\n\nMobility (cm2 kV\u22121 s\u22121 )\nHSK\nExpt.\n0.31\n0.31\n0.33\n\n0.133\u00b10.004a\n0.240\u00b10.011\u00b10.011b\nc\n0.211+0.020\n\u22120.012\n\n6.\nwork.\n7.\n\n0.2\n0\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\nElectric field (kV/cm)\n\nFIG. 5: Global fit to the ion drift velocity as a function of\nelectric field for the entire data set.\n\nsmall mechanical vibrations of the probe when the electric field is switched, and from the accuracy of the voltage\ngain in the amplifier. These contributions are estimated\nto give a combined error of \u00b1 0.011 cm2 /(kV-s). Table\nI shows the absolute errors on the voltages, drift distances and electric fields. The systematic error on the\nion mobility was computed by shifting the electric field\nand drift distance values by their corresponding errors\nand re-doing the fit.\n\nIV.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nTo help us understand our result, we have considered\na transport model due to Hilt, Schmidt and Khrapak2\n(henceforth referred to as HSK). In this model the microscopic properties of the ion and its detailed coupling\nto the liquid atoms are neglected, and the ionic mobility\nis determined solely by the equation of state of the liquid\nin question. The ion is modeled as a point charge whose\nelectric field exerts a pressure on the liquid of sufficient\nmagnitude for a microscopic ice layer to form around the\nion. The ion and its attached cluster of Xe atoms then\nbehave as a positively charged ball of ice whose radius is\ndetermined by the distance at which the electric field is\nno longer of a magnitude sufficient to compress the liquid into the solid state2 . In this theory, no distinction\nis made between the mobilities of ions of different identities, and the drag suffered by the ion and its attached\ncluster is computed from the bulk viscosity of the liquid.\nShown in Table II are some selected experimental mobilities for atomic ions in LXe. From these results it is\nclear that the HSK model does quite well in predicting\nthe overall scale of the observed mobilities. However,\nthe significant difference between the 208 Tl+ and 226 Th+\nnumbers suggests that these species differ enough microscopically that the HSK model, when applied to them,\n\nbegins to break down.\nIt should be pointed out that all of the calculations\nassume an ionic charge state of +1, which may not be\ncorrect. This is based on the argument that the energetics of charge exchange favor such a final state,6 but this\nassertion has not yet been convincingly verified experimentally. Nonetheless, we find that assuming an ionic\ncharge other than +1 does not improve the compatibility between the theory and the data for any of the cases\nconsidered here.\nOverall, it can be concluded that HSK provides a reasonable rough approximation of the ion mobility for the\nsystems under consideration. However, it remains to be\nseen whether the model produces the correct temperature\ndependence in all cases. In addition, it is worth understanding the situations in which the ion identity becomes\nimportant because this would offer clues as to how HSK\ncould be simply improved.\nA theory put forward by Davis, Rice and Meyer (henceforth referred to as DRM) might offer some clues as to\nhow this might be accomplished.1 These authors have derived an expression for the positive ion mobility in which\nthe internal structure of the ion and its interaction with\nthe liquid are taken into account. In this model the drag\nforce experienced by the ion is determined by the microscopic interaction potentials rather than the bulk properties of the liquid. It is conceivable, at least in principle,\nthat as the ion-liquid interaction increases in strength,\nbound states between the ion and several liquid atoms\ncan occur, particularly as the temperature of the liquid is\nlowered. Nevertheless, the treatment reported in Ref. 1\nis specific to conditions in which this effect is not present,\ni.e., the ion-liquid interaction is too weak and the liquid\ntemperature is too high. Indeed, the DRM model has\nonly been compared with experimental data from systems involving molecular ions in liquids at temperatures\nwell above the liquid triple point, namely He2 + in LHe\n(Ref. 4), Ar2 + in LAr (Ref. 1), and Kr2 + in LKr (Ref.\n3). While these systems are satisfactorily described by\nthe model, it is clear that some modification will be necessary in order to treat the case of atomic ion mobilities\nclose to the triple point. This is because the atomic ions\nunder consideration have interaction strengths that are\ntens of times stronger21,22 than those of the molecular\nions previously considered.\n\n\f6\nTo investigate these details experimentally, one could\nperform an accurate measurement of the temperature dependence of the ion mobility in several different ion-liquid\nsystems. This would require multiple, well-understood\nand well-controlled sources of ions of known identity. A\ncomplementary approach would be to use the 226 Th ion\nsource in several different liquefied noble gases at various\ntemperatures.\n\nV.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nWe have measured the 226 Th ion mobility in LXe at\n163.0K and standard pressure and have found it to have\na value of 0.240\u00b10.011 (stat) \u00b10.011 (syst) cm2 /(kV-s).\nThe HSK model gives the correct order of magnitude\n\n\u2020\n\u2021\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n9\n\n10\n\nwhen used to calculate ion mobilities, however it cannot\naccount for the significant difference between our result\nand the one measured for 208 Tl+ by other workers. A\nmore detailed study of this effect may help to suggest\nhow the HSK model can be modified to account for\ndifferent ion identities. A possible route might be to\ngeneralize the DRM treatment to the case of atomic ions\nthat form bound states with liquid atoms.\n\nNow at Columbia University, New York NY 10027, USA.\nNow at CERN, Geneva, Switzerland.\nH.T.
