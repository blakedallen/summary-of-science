Introduction\nGeneral Relativity in 3+1 dimensions does not admit static, nonsingular, asymptotically\nflat and topolotically trivial vacuum space-time solutions [1\u20133]. In this article, we\ninvestigate whether such configurations of the gravitation field, or gravitational geons\n[4\u20136], are possible on the brane in the Randall and Sundrum model [7, 8] in which the\nthree spatial dimensions that we experience are a 3 dimensional brane embedded in a\n4+1 dimensional space-time. The effective 3+1 dimensional Einstein field equations on\nthe brane for the Randall and Sundrum model were derived by Shiromizu, Maeda, and\nSasaki [9].\nGravity on the brane is prevented from leaking into the extra dimension at low\nenergies by a negative bulk cosmological constant [10]. This negative cosmological\nconstant can be offset by a positive brane tension such that there is a zero cosmological\nconstant on the brane. In the case of a gravitational geon solution in which no matter\nis present, there would nevertheless be a generally non-zero effective energy-momentum\ntensor induced on the brane corresponding to\n(4)\n\nE\u03bc\u03bd =\n\n1 (5) \u03b1\nC\u03b2\u03c1\u03c3 \u03b7\u03b1 \u03b7 \u03c1 h\u03b2\u03bc h\u03c3\u03bd\n8\u03c0\n\n(1)\n\n\u03b1\nwhere (4) E\u03bc\u03bd is a 4-dimensional projection of the 5-dimensional Weyl tensor (5) C\u03b2\u03c1\u03c3\n, \u03b7\u03b1\nis normal to the brane and h\u03bc\u03bd = g\u03bc\u03bd \u2212 \u03b7\u03bc \u03b7\u03bd is the induced metric on the brane [9, 11].\nIn their investigation of black holes on the brane, Dadhich, Maartens, Papadopoulos\nand Rezania showed that the Reissner-Nordstrom metric is an exact solution to the\neffective 3+1 dimensional Einstein field equations on the brane and can be interpreted\nas a black hole without electric charge but with a tidal charge that arises from the\n\n\f2\n\nGravitational Geons on the Brane\n\nsolution to the Einstein field equations in 4+1 dimensions [12]. They further showed\nthat, in the induced metric for their exact black hole solution, the free gravitational\nfield in the bulk contributes a negative effective energy density on the brane and tends\nto strengthen the gravitational field.\nIn this paper, we investigate whether the free gravitational field in the bulk modifies\nthe gravitational field on the brane so that gravitational geons are possible on the brane.\nOur approach is to look at a specific static, spherically symmetric solution of the form\nds2 = \u2212B(r)dt2 + A(r)dr 2 + r 2 (d\u03b82 + sin2 \u03b8d\u03c62 ) .\n\n(2)\n\nFor this metric, the 4 dimensional Ricci scalar on the brane is given by [11]\nB\u2032\nB \u2032\u2032\n\u2212\nR=\nAB 2AB\n\nA\u2032 B \u2032\n+\nA\nB\n\n!\n\n2\n+\nAr\n\nB \u2032 A\u2032\n\u2212\nB\nA\n\n!\n\n+\n\n2\n2\n\u2212\n,\nAr 2 r 2\n\n(3)\n\nwhere the prime indicates differentiation with respect to r.\nOur approach is to choose B(r) and solve R = 0 in (3) for A(r). Substituting a\nsolution to R = 0 into the Einstein field equations for 3+1 dimensional general relativity\ngives a trace free energy-momentum tensor\nT\u03bc\u03bd =\n\n1\nR\u03bc\u03bd ,\n8\u03c0\n\n(4)\n\nthat satisfies\n\u2207\u03bc T\u03bc\u03bd = 0 .\n\n(5)\n\nFor a vacuum solution on the brane, the projection of the 5-dimensional Weyl tensor\n(1) satisfies [12, 13]\n\u2207\u03bc E\u03bc\u03bd = 0 ,\n\n(6)\n\nallowing us to make the correspondence 8\u03c0T\u03bc\u03bd = \u2212E\u03bc\u03bd and treat R = 0 along with\nequations (4) and (5) as a closed system of equations on the brane. The effect is that\n(from [12])\n\"a stationary general relativity solution with trace-free energy-momentum\ntensor gives rise to a vacuum brane-world solution in 5-dimensional gravity.\"\nExamples of other papers that use this correspondence to investigate vacuum solutions\non the brane with R = 0 (or R = 4\u039b if one assumes a non-zero cosmological constant\non the brane) include [11, 14\u201318].\nIn this paper we will show that gravitational geons are possible on the brane.\nWe are not interested in space-time solutions with singularities so we examined the\nKretschmann scalar for divergent behaviour in order to identify candidate space-times.\nThe Kretschmann scalar is given by\nR\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1\u03c3 R\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1\u03c3 = 4K12 + 8K22 + 8K32 + 4K42\n\n(7)\n\n\f3\n\nGravitational Geons on the Brane\nwhere [14]\n1\nK1 =\nA\n\nB \u2032\u2032 (B \u2032 )2 A\u2032 B \u2032\n\u2212\n\u2212\n2B\n4B 2\n4AB\n\n!\n\n,\n\n(8)\n\nB\u2032\n,\n(9)\n2ABr\n\u2212A\u2032\nand\n(10)\nK3 =\n2A2 r\nA\u22121\nK4 =\n.\n(11)\nAr 2\nFrom (10) and (11) we must have lim A(r) = 1 + O(r n ) with n \u2265 2 to avoid\nr\u21920\nB \u2032 (r)\ndivergence of the Kretschmann scalar. Similarly, from (9) it follows that lim\n=\nr\u21920 B(r)\nO(r m) with m \u2265 1.\nIn this paper, we take\nK2 =\n\n2mr 2\n,\n(12)\nr 3 + 2ml2\nfor which B \u2032 (0) = 0, B(0) = 1, both B(r) and B \u2032 (r) are continuous for all r \u2265 0 and\nB(r) is Schwarzschild in the limit as r \u2192 \u221e. We also consider general functions B(r)\nin the weak field limit.\nThe solutions that we investigate have A(r) and B(r) greater than zero and finite\nfor all r \u2265 0. This ensures that the spacetime will be nonsingular and without horizons.\nB(r) = 1 \u2212\n\n2. Outline of Our Approach\nFor static solutions, we have R = 0 which can be written as\nA\u2032 =\n\n(2BB \u2032\u2032 r 2 \u2212 (B \u2032 )2 r 2 + 4BB \u2032 r + 4B 2 )A \u2212 4B 2 A2\n.\nBr(B \u2032 r + 4B)\n\n(13)\n\nWe did not find a general solution to (13) for our choice of B(r). In the absence of\na general solution, our approach is as follows\n\u2022 Solve (13) in the weak field limit.\n\u2022 Use directional field plots (generated using Maple) and iterative numerical analysis\nto discover the behaviour of A(r).\n\u2022 Find solutions near potential singular points (i.e. at r = 0 and B \u2032 r + 4B = 0) in\n(13) using series approximation. Specifically, we write (13) in the form\nA\u2032 (r) = f (r)A(r) + g(r)A2 (r) .\n\n(14)\n\nLetting F \u2032 (r) = f (r) then (14) has the solution [14]\n\u22121\n.\n(15)\nA(r) = \u2212F (r) R\ne\ng(r)eF (r)dr\n\u2022 Examine the behaviour of the Kretschmann scalar R\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1\u03c3 R\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1\u03c3 at potential singular\npoints.\n\n\f4\n\nGravitational Geons on the Brane\n3. The Weak Field Approximation\n\nIn the weak field, taking B(r) = 1 + b(r) and A(r) = 1 + a(r) with |b(r)| << 1 and\n|a(r)| << 1, (13) can be written as\na\u2032 \u2248\n\nb\u2032\u2032 r 2 + 2b\u2032 r \u2212 2a\n.\n2r\n\n(16)\n\nThis has the solution (where c is a constant of integration)\nb\u2032 r c\na=\n+ .\n(17)\n2\nr\nNoting that c = 0 to ensure that A is finite at r = 0, any choice of B(r) for which b\u2032 r is\nsmall for all r would give suitable geon solutions in the weak field.\nFor our choice of B(r) this becomes\na=\n\nmr 5 \u2212 4m2 l2 r 2\n.\n(r 3 + 2ml2 )2\n\n(18)\n\u0010 \u00112\n\n1\n\n\u0010 \u00112\n\nFor r << (ml2 ) 3 we have B \u2248 1 + rl and A \u2248 1 \u2212 rl . A(r) therefore satisfies\nthe requirements that A(0) = 1 and lim A(r) = 1 + O(r n) with n \u2265 2. It is worth\nr\u21920\nnoting that for large r, A differs from Schwarzschild with A \u2248 1 + mr . Furthermore, the\nconditions for the weak field,\n|b(r)| =\n|a(r)| =\n\n2mr 2\n<< 1 and\nr 3 + 2ml2\nmr 5 \u2212 4m2 l2 r 2\n<< 1\n(r 3 + 2ml2 )2\n\nare both met for rl << 1 and for\ngravitational geons.\n\nm\nl\n\n(19)\n(20)\n\n<< 1. The solutions (see fig.1) correspond to\n\n4. General Behaviour\nWe did not find a general solution to (13) for strong gravitational fields. We examined\nthe behaviour of A(r) using a fourth order Runge-Kutta numerical iteration. Using this\n\u0010 \u00112\nmethod, we were unable to begin at exactly A(0) = 1. However, A \u2248 1 \u2212 rl for\nsmall r. Thus, if we choose an iteration length \u2206r so that \u2206r\n= 10\u22125 then A(\u2206r) \u2248 1\nl\nto within 10\u221210 (independent of m). Also, having made the observation from direction\nfield plots that the solution is insensitive to small changes in the initial value of A, we\nchose \u2206r appropriately and used A(\u2206r) = 1 as the starting point of the iteration.\nWe are interested in solutions for which both A(r) and B(r) are greater than zero\nand finite for all r \u2265 0. The zeros of B can be determined by noting that B(0) = 1,\n1\nlim B(r) = 1 and that B \u2032 = 0 at r = (4ml2 ) 2 where B has its minimum value of\nr\u2192\u221e\n\n2\n\n1 \u2212 31 (4 ml ) 3 . Thus\n\n\f5\n\nGravitational Geons on the Brane\n\nB has\n\nzeros\n\nif\n\nm\nl\n\n<\n\none zero\n\nif\n\nm\nl\n\n=\n\ntwo zeros\n\nif\n\nm\nl\n\n>\n\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\nno\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\n\n\u221a\n\n27\n4\n\u221a\n27\n4\n\u221a\n27\n4\n\n(21)\n.\n\nWe proceeded to examine the numerical iteration of A(r).

Consequently, all solutions with A(0) = 1\ncorrespond to gravitational geons. Choosing l = 1 we confirmed the behavior of A using\niterative numerical analysis (see fig.4). Also evident is the progression from the weak\n32\n< ml < 1.191\nfield solution for ml << 1 (fig.1) to the piecewise constructed solution for 27\n(fig.5) which we discuss in the following section.\n4.2.\n\n32\n27\n\n<\n\nm\nl\n\n< 1.191 with \u03bb = 0 at the second zero of B \u2032 r + 4B\n\n\u03b11 \u2212\u03b21 \u03b12 )\n1\nAt the first zero of B \u2032 r + 4B, A = \u2212\u03b1\n> 0 and A\u2032 = \u03b11 (\u03b2\u03b2 22(\u03b1\n> 0 for values of ml\n\u03b21\n1 +1)\n1\nin this range. There is therefore no singular behaviour and no horizon indicated at the\ncorresponding spherical hypersurface.\nAt the second zero of B \u2032 r + 4B, A = 0 indicating singular behaviour in the space\u03b11 \u2212\u03b21 \u03b12 )\n1\n> 0 at the\ntime except when \u03bb = 0.

Consequently, no singular behaviour or horizon is indicated.\nWhereas our analysis of the Kretshmann scalar shows the possibility of solutions\ncorresponding to gravitational geons with \u03bb = 0 at the second zero, instability at\neach zero prevents us from confirming any particular solution using iterative methods\n\u2212\u03b11\n(see fig.6). However, we have been able to confirm that lim A =\nand lim A\u2032 =\nx\u21920\nx\u21920\n\u03b21\n\u03b11 (\u03b22 \u03b11 \u2212 \u03b21 \u03b12 )\naround each zero for each section constructed numerically (see figs. 7,\n\u03b212 (\u03b11 + 1)\n8, 9).\nWe piecewise constructed A around each zero of B \u2032 r + 4B using the numerically\nconstructed sections (see fig.5). The resulting solution is sewn together at the spherical\nhypersurfaces corresponding to each zero.\nThe sewing together of two manifolds may induce a surface energy-momentum\ntensor [19, 20]\n\nS\u03bc\u03bd =\n\n1\n([K\u03bc\u03bd ] \u2212 [K]h\u03bc\u03bd )\n8\u03c0\n\n(34)\n\non the surface where they are joined. Here K\u03bc\u03bd is the extrinsic curvature of the surface,\nK = K \u03bc \u03bc , h\u03bc\u03bd is the induced metric on the surface and [K\u03bc\u03bd ] denotes the jump in K\u03bc\u03bd\nacross the surface.\n\n\fGravitational Geons on the Brane\n\n8\n\nNow, K\u03bc\u03bd depends on the metric and its first derivatives [21]. Given that\nA, B and B \u2032 are all continuous in our piecewise constructed solution, there will be a\nnon-vanishing S\u03bc\u03bd only if A\u2032 is discontinuous across either hypersuface corresponding to\na zero of B \u2032 r + 4B. Our analysis shows that A\u2032 is continuous implying that S\u03bc\u03bd = 0.\nIt should be noted that there could be contributions to S\u03bc\u03bd from the Weyl term\n(1). If that were the case, S\u03bc\u03bd = 0 in our piecewise constructed solution would imply\nthat there is a localized gravitational source (such as matter) at the hypersurface and\nthe stresses contributed by each cancel one another exactly. Since the space-time off the\nbrane is not known, it is not possible to check to see if such contributions exist.\nIf there are no contributions to S\u03bc\u03bd from the Weyl tensor, the piecewise constructed\nsolutions correspond to gravitational geons.\n4.3. Choices of\n\nm\nl\n\nfor which no gravitational geon solutions exist\n\nOur analysis shows that the Kretshmann scalar diverges at the spherical hypersurfaces\ncorresponding to the zeros of B \u2032 r + 4B for values of ml > 1.202. We have therefore\ndetermined that solutions that correspond to gravitational geons do not exist for these\nvalues of ml .\nIn the range 1.191 < ml < 1.202, divergence of the Kretshmann scalar rules out\nthe possibility of gravitational geon solutions, except in the special case that \u03bb = 0 at\nboth zeros of B \u2032 r + 4B. However, direction field plots indicate that these solutions are\ninconsistent with our boundary conditions.\nAs discussed in the previous section, gravitational geon solutions are again ruled\n32\n< ml < 1.191, except in the\nout by divergence of the Kretshmann scalar in the range 27\nspecial case that \u03bb = 0 at the second zero of B \u2032 r + 4B.\nThere are therefore no solutions that correspond to gravitational geons possible for\nm\n> 32\nwith the exception of \u03bb = 0 at the second zero of B \u2032 r + 4B for 32\n< ml < 1.191.\nl\n27\n27\n5. Conclusion\nIn this paper, we investigated a particular static, spherically symmetric 3+1 dimensional\nspace-time for behaviour consistent with that of gravitational geons on a brane\nembedded in a 4+1 dimensional space-time. In the absence of a general solution, we\ninvestigated the behaviour of the space-time using a variety of methods and were able to\nascertain that, for a particular set of parameter choices, gravitational geons are possible.\nThe significance of the result presented in this paper is that, in general, for braneworld space-times gravitational geons are possible. We investigated solutions in the\nweak field limit and showed that gravitational geons will exist as long as B \u2032 r is small for\n2\nand showed that\nall r \u2265 0. We also investigated the specific function B(r) = 1 \u2212 r32mr\n+2ml2\ngravitational geon solutions exist for all parameter choices such that ml < 32\n. These\n27\nsolutions include both weak field and strong field geons.\nIf our universe corresponds to the Randall-Sundrum model, then gravitational\n\n\fGravitational Geons on the Brane\n\n9\n\ngeons could represent a form of dark matter (this possibility has also been discussed\nby Sones [6] for quantum geons with a Klein-Gordon field).\nAcknowledgments\nThis research was supported by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council\nof Canada.\nReferences\n[1]\n[2]\n[3]\n[4]\n[5]\n[6]\n[7]\n[8]\n[9]\n[10]\n[11]\n[12]\n[13]\n[14]\n[15]\n[16]\n[17]\n[18]\n[19]\n[20]\n[21]\n\nR.
