The radio emission associated with BL Lac objects is synchrotron emission, which\ncan be linearly polarized up to about 75% in the optically thin (jet) region, and up to 10\u2013\n15% in the optically thick (core) region (Pacholczyk 1970). VLBI polarization observations\nof BL Lac objects have shown a tendency for the polarization E vectors in the parsecscale jets to be aligned with the local jet direction, which implies that the corresponding\nB field is transverse to the jet, because the jet is optically thin (Gabuzda, Pushkarev &\nCawthorne 2000). Although in the past, the dominance of the transverse B field component\nwas suggested to be the consequence of a 'shock model' where a series of relativistic shocks\ncompress and enhance the transverse B field component (Laing 1980; Hughes, Aller & Aller\n1989), this seems an improbable explanation for the transverse fields detected in extended\nregions in the jets of some sources. Instead, a helical B field associated with the jet, with the\ntoroidal component dominating over the longitudinal component, would be a more plausible\nexplanation (Lyutikov, Pariev & Gabuzda 2005). In fact, systematic gradients in the Faraday\nrotation have been observed across the parsec-scale jets of a number of AGN, interpreted as\nreflecting the systematic change in the line-of-sight component of a toroidal or helical jet B\nfield across the jet (Asada et al. 2002; Gabuzda, Murray, Cronin 2004; Zavala & Taylor 2005;\nGabuzda et al. 2008; Mahmud & Gabuzda 2008; Asada et al. 2008a,b); such fields would\ncome about in a natural way as a result of the \"winding up\" of an initial \"seed\" field by the\nrotation of the central accreting objects (e.g. Nakamura, Uchida & Hirose 2001: Lovelace et\nal. 2002).\nFaraday Rotation studies are crucial in determining the intrinsic B field geometries associated with the jets. Faraday Rotation of the plane of linear polarization occurs during the\npassage of an electromagnetic wave through a region with free electrons and a magnetic field\nwith a non-zero component along the line-of-sight. The amount of rotation is proportional\n\n\fFaraday Rotation Gradients in B1803+784\n\n3\n\nto the integral of the density of free electrons ne multiplied by the line-of-sight B field B * dl,\n\nthe square of the observing wavelength \u03bb2 , and various physical constants; the coefficient of\n\u03bb2 is called the Rotation Measure (RM):\n\u2206\u03c7 \u221d \u03bb2\n\nZ\n\nne B * dl \u2261 RM\u03bb2\n\n(1)\n\nThe intrinsic polarization angle can be obtained from the following equation:\n\u03c7obs = \u03c70 + RM\u03bb2\n\n(2)\n\nwhere \u03c7obs is the observed polarization angle and \u03c70 is the intrinsic polarization angle observed if no rotation occurred (Burn 1966). Simultaneous multifrequency observations thus\nallow the determination of the RM, as well as identifying the intrinsic polarization angles\n\u03c70 .\nB1803+784 has been studied using VLBI for nearly three decades. The predominant jet\ndirection in centimetre-wavelength images is toward the West. The dominant jet B field\nis perpendicular to the local jet direction essentially throughout the jet, from distances\nof less than 1 mas from the VLBI core (Gabuzda 1999, Lister 2001) to tens of mas from\nthe core (Gabuzda & Chernetskii 2003; Hallahan & Gabuzda 2009); further, the B field\nremains orthogonal even in extended regions and in the presence of appreciable bending of\nthe jet. Therefore, it seems most likely that this transverse jet B field primarily represents\nthe toroidal component of the intrinsic B field of the jet, rather than a series of transverse\nshocks (of course, this does not rule out the possibility that some individual compact features\nmay be shocks). We have detected a transverse RM gradient across the VLBI jet; although\nit is difficult to prove conclusively, combined with the observation of orthogonal B fields\nthroughout the jet, even in the presence of appreciable bending, this provides direct evidence\nthat the jet has a helical B field. Comparison of the gradients observed for several different\nepochs shows that the direction of the gradient changed sometime between June 2000 and\nAugust 2002. We discuss the data demonstrating this unexpected change, as well as possible\norigins of the observed reversal of the RM gradient.\n\n2\n\nFARADAY-ROTATION OBSERVATIONS AND REDUCTION\n\nWe consider here polarization data for B1803+784 obtained using the ten 25-m radio telescopes of the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) at four different epochs: 6 April 1997\n(Gabuzda & Chernetskii 2003), 27 June 2000 (Zavala & Taylor 2003), 24 August 2002 and\n\n\f4\n\nM. Mahmud, D. C. Gabuzda & V. Bezrukovs\n\n22 August 2003. Table 1 lists the observing frequencies for each epoch. The observations\nfor 24 August 2002 and 22 August 2003 were obtained as part of a multi-frequency polarization study of about three dozen BL Lac objects. In all cases the sources were observed\nin a 'snap-shot' mode with 8\u201310 scans of each object spread out over the time. The preliminary calibration, D-term calibration and polarization calibration were all done in AIPS\nusing standard techniques. For more detailed calibration information for the 1997 data, see\nGabuzda & Chernetskii (2003) and Reynolds, Cawthorne & Gabuzda (2001), and for the\nJune 2000 data see Zavala & Taylor (2003).\nNote that Gabuzda & Chernetskii (2003) presented results at 22 GHz in addition to\nthe 15, 8.4 and 5 GHz results considered here; we did not include the 22 GHz data in our\nFaraday rotation analysis because this substantially restricted the region in the jet where\npolarization was reliably detected at all the frequencies used. In regions where polarization\nwas detected at 22, 15, 8.4 and 5 GHz, the derived rotation measures are consistent with\nthe three-frequency results presented here.\n\n2.1\n\n24 August 2002 and 22 August 2003\n\nThe instrumental polarizations (D-terms) were determined using the AIPS task LPCAL,\nsolving simultaneously for the source polarization in individual VLBI components. The\nsources used for this purpose were 1308+326 (August 2002) and 1156+295 (August 2003).\nThe Electric Vector Polarization Angle (EVPA) calibration was done using integrated polarization observations of a bright, compact source, obtained with the Very Large Array (VLA),\nby forcing the EVPA for the total VLBI polarization of the source to match the EVPA for\nthe integrated polarization (www.aoc.nrao.edu/ smyers/calibration/). The sources used for\nthe EVPA calibration were 1749+096 (observed with the VLA on 10 August 2002) and\n2200+420 (observed with the VLA on 18 August 2002 and 21 August 2003). The sources\nwere observed with the VLA at frequencies 5, 8.5, 22 and 43 GHz. We found the obtained\nvalues to be consistent with the (Faraday Rotation) linear \u03bb2 law and were thus able to\ninterpolate from the graph the corresponding values for our non-standard frequencies. We\nrefined the calibration by checking for self-consistency between the various frequencies, and\nalso with the other EVPA calibration results for VLBA experiments before and after ours\nthat were calibrated using the same reference antenna (the EVPA corrections for a given\nreference antenna are typically stable to within \u03c7 \u223c5\u25e6 over several years; see Reynolds et al.\n\n\fFaraday Rotation Gradients in B1803+784\n\n5\n\nTable 1.

Table 2 shows the\nfinal applied EVPA corrections.\nThe August 2003 data include several frequencies that differ from the standard 5, 8 and\n15 GHz frequencies for the VLBA. Although system temperatures and gain curves were\nprovided for all six frequencies observed at this epoch, there may be some concern that the\naccuracy of the overall flux calibration for these slightly 'non-standard' frequencies could\nbe slightly lower than for the standard VLBA frequencies. Accordingly, we determined the\nspectra of various optically thin regions in the jet, to verify that there was no evidence for\nany of the frequencies deviating from the behaviour shown by the others. Before determining\nthe spectra, we aligned the images at the various frequencies using the algorithm of Croke &\nGabuzda (2008). A typical example, corresponding to a position 3.4 mas West and 0.3 mas\nNorth of the VLBI core, is shown in Fig. 1; we can see that the observed 4.6\u201315.3 GHz fluxes\nare all consistent with a power-law within the errors, corresponding to a \"normal\" optically\nthin spectral index of \u22120.89 \u00b1 0.02. Thus, we find no evidence for inaccuracy of the overall\nflux calibration at any of our six frequencies.\n\nWe made maps of the distribution of the total intensity I and Stokes parameters Q and U\nat the different frequencies with matched resolutions corresponding to the lowest- or middle\u221a\nfrequency beam.

Both these plots and the RM slices in Figs. 4\n\u2013 6 clearly demonstrate the systematic, monotonic nature of the observed RM gradients.\nThe RM map of Zavala & Taylor (2003) for June 2000 also shows a clear transverse\ngradient, with a negative RM along the Northern edge of the jet and less negative or positive\nRM along the Southern edge, similar to the RM map observed in August 2002 (Fig. 5). An\nimportant feature that emerges in a comparison of the various RM maps is the reversal in\nthe direction of the RM gradient in the jet of B1803+784 between June 2000 and August\n2002. The RM values increase toward the Southern edge of the jet in the April 1997 and\nJune 2000 (Zavala & Taylor 2003) RM maps, but toward the Northern edge of the jet in the\nAugust 2002 and August 2003 RM maps.\n\n\fFaraday Rotation Gradients in B1803+784\n\n11\n\nFigure 6.

Note that the observed \"core\"\nemission is actually a mixture of emission from the core and inner jet, so it is not surprising\nthat transverse RM gradients should be detected in the core region, since the associated\nhelical field is present on a wide range of scales, down to the accretion disk region.\n\n4\n4.1\n\nDISCUSSION\nPossible Origins of the RM-gradient Reversal\n\nThe origin for the observed \"flip\" in the direction of the transverse RM gradient in the jet\nof B1803+784 between June 2000 and August 2002 is not clear. No radical change in the\nintensity or polarization structure of the VLBI jet accompanied the observed RM-gradient\nflip. We qualitatively consider here several possible scenarios that could potentially give\nrise to this behaviour. Although it is not possible at this stage to distinguish between these\nscenarios, our goal here is simply to point out possible explanations, which it may be possible\nto test with further observations or numerical simulations.\nIn this discussion, we will suppose that the RM gradient is associated with a helical jet\n\n\f14\n\nM. Mahmud, D. C. Gabuzda & V. Bezrukovs\n\nFigure 10. RM maps of B1803+784 observed on August 2002 (top) and August 2003 (core region shown on bottom left and\njet on bottom right), convolved with the same beam as was used for the April 1997 image in Fig. 4. The range of RM values\nshown in the color bars for the RM maps is in units of kilorad/m2 (top: August 2002) and in rad/m2 (bottom left and bottom\nright: August 2003). The peak fluxes are 1.9 Jy/beam for August 2002 and 1.4 Jy/beam for August 2003; the lowest contours\nare 2.0 mJy/beam for both epochs. The transverse gradients identified based on the images with their intrinsic beams are still\nvisible in each of these matched-resolution maps.\n\nB field that is due to the rotation of the central black hole. In this case, the direction of the\nobserved transverse RM gradient is determined by the direction of rotation of the black hole\nand the \"polarity\" of the poloidal field component, i.e, North or South/outward or inward\nrelative to the black hole.\nReversal of the \"pole\" of the black hole facing the Earth. It is obviously not\nreasonable to suppose that the observed reversal in the RM gradient is due to a change in\nthe direction of rotation of the central black hole. However, one way to retain a transverse\nRM gradient in a helical magnetic field model but reverse the direction of this gradient,\nis if the direction of rotation of the central black hole (i.e. the direction in which the field\nthreading the accretion disc is \"wound up\") remains constant, but the \"pole\" of the black\nhole facing the Earth changes from North to South, or vice versa (Fig. 8). To our knowledge,\n\n\fFaraday Rotation Gradients in B1803+784\n\n15\n\nit is currently not known whether such polarity reversals are possible for AGN jets, or\nwhether they could occur on a time scale as short as a few years. Numerical simulations\nof the generation and propagation of helical magnetic fields for various initial seed-field\nconfigurations could potentially answer these questions.\nTorsional oscillations of the jet. Another way in which the direction of the azimuthal\ncomponent of a helical B field could change is as a result of torsional oscillations of the\njet, such as those that have been proposed by Bisnovatyi-Kogan (2007). These torsional\noscillations, which may stabilize the jets, essentially correspond to a change in the direction\nof rotation of the jet, and could cause reversals of the azimuthal B field component from\ntime to time, probably periodically or quasi-periodically. Of course, we have only observed\na single reversal in the direction of the RM gradient, and so have no information at this\nstage about whether this phenomena is periodic. Therefore, this model remains a possible\nexplanation for the observed RM-gradient reversal, but we currently have no firm evidence\nin support of this model. If future multi-frequency VLBA polarization observations show\nthe presence of periodic reversals of the direction of a transverse RM gradient across the jet,\nthis will provide support for this type of model.\nA \"Nested-helix\" magnetic-field structure. Another intriguing possibility is related\nto magnetic-tower-type scenarios for the launching of jets (Lynden-Bell 1996). In this picture,\nmagnetic field lines anchored in the inner accretion disc are carried outward along with the\njet flow and return in outer layers of the jet, closing through the outer part of the accretion\ndisc. Combined with the effect of the differential rotation of the accretion disc, this gives\nrise to a \"nested helical field\" structure, with an \"inner\" helical field displaying a helicity\ncorresponding to the direction of rotation of the accretion disc and the magnetic polarity of\nthe jet base and an \"outer\" helical field displaying the opposite helicity (Fig. 9). The pitch\nangles of the inner and outer helical fields may be different, most likely with the inner field\nhaving a lower pitch angle (being more tightly wound). The net RM gradient we observe\nwill include contributions from both of these fields, corresponding to the volumes of both of\nthese regions that lie along the line of sight between the emission region and the observer.\nThe directions of the RM gradients associated with each region will be opposite, and the\nnet observed RM gradient will be determined by whether the inner or outer region makes\nthe larger contribution to the net observed RM. In turn, this will be determined by the\ndistribution of the electron density and magnetic field along the jet and with distance from\nthe jet axis. The direction of the observed RM gradient could \"flip\" if, for example, the outer\n\n\f16\n\nM. Mahmud, D. C. Gabuzda & V. Bezrukovs\n\nregion of helical field usually dominates the observed RM distribution, but the inner region\nof helical field temporarily became dominant due to an increase in the electron density or\nmagnetic-field strength in the inner region of helical field. Such variations in electron density\nand/or magnetic-field strength could come about due to variations in activity of the central\nengine and the ejection of jet material. In this case, the resulting reversals in the direction\nof the net observed RM gradient would most likely not occur periodically, and may follow\nactivity of the VLBI core. If future observations provide evidence for a connection between\nepochs when the direction of the transverse RM gradient reverses and periods of enhanced\ncore activity, this will provide support for this type of scenario.\nChanges in the distribution of thermal electrons surrounding the jet. Finally,\nwe should consider whether the observed change in the direction of the transverse RM\ngradient could be due purely to changes in the distribution of thermal gas in the vicinity\nof the jet, unrelated to the presence of a helical jet magnetic field. Could the transverse\ngradient in the RM be due, for example, to a gradient in the thermal electron density across\nthe jet, with the change in the direction of the gradient corresponding to a change in the\nside of the jet where the electron density was highest? In this scenario, the changes in the\nobserved RM distribution would essentially be due to \"patchiness\" in a moving intervening\nFaraday screen, and so would probably occur fairly randomly with time.\nWe find this explanation unlikely for several reasons. The first is that our observations\nand the observations of Zavala & Taylor (2003) consistently show the presence of transverse\nRM gradients over roughly six years, whereas we would expect the RM pattern produced\nby a moving \"patchy\" screen not to be as consistent. Further, in our 1997 RM map (Fig. 4),\nthe RM on the Northern side of the jet is negative, whereas the RM on the Southern side\nof the jet is positive: a change of the sign of the RM from one side of the jet to the other\nis difficult to explain as the result of a patchy thermal-electron distribution, but is quite\nnatural if the observed RM gradient is due to a helical jet magnetic field. With regard to\nthe observed changes in the RM distribution, a comparison of our 1997 and 2003 RM maps\n(Figs. 4 and 6) shows that the RM on the Northern side of the jet is negative in 1997, but\npositive in 2003. Here, also, a change in the thermal-electron distribution is not sufficient to\nexplain these observations: they require that the direction of the line-of-sight component of\nthe magnetic field in the region of Faraday rotation has changed between these two epochs.\nSince a change in the line-of-sight magnetic field is required, this makes it natural to consider\nscenarios involving changes in a helical jet magnetic field structure.\n\n\fFaraday Rotation Gradients in B1803+784\n\n17\n\nFinally, we note that another possible way to explain time-variable Faraday rotation is\nif compact jet components \"illuminate\" different regions in a static, inhomogeneous foreground Faraday screen as they move behind it, as was suggested by Zavala & Taylor (2001)\nfor the core RM variations in 3C279. However, this is likewise an unlikely explanation for\nthe RM changes observed for B1803+784, because it is difficult to imagine how this effect\ncould give rise to changes in the RM pattern across the jet. In addition, the apparent speeds\nof VLBI components near the region where we have detected the transverse RM gradients\nin B1803+784 are low: an essentially quasi-stationary component has been observed roughly\n1.5 mas from the core for nearly three decades, and no features detected closer than a few\nmas from the core show clear motions (Kellermann et al. 2004; Gabuzda & Chernetskii 2003;\nhttp://www.physics.purdue.edu/MOJAVE/sepavstime/B1803 +784 sepvstime.gif). This likewise appears to make it unlikely that the scenario envisaged for 3C279 is operating in this\nregion of the B1803+784 jet, since none of the observed compact VLBI features display\nappreciable motions.\n\n4.2\n\nPropagation of the RM gradient reversal\n\nIt is interesting to consider the possible motion or propagation of the transverse RM gradient\npattern. To compare the distances from the core where the transverse RM gradient is most\nclearly visible, we must construct RM maps for the different epochs using the same restoring\nbeam. We have used the beam in Fig. 4 for this purpose, and the RM maps for August 2002\nand August 2003 constructed using this beam are shown in Fig. 10. We first note that the\ntransverse gradients we initially identified based on the images with their intrinsic beams\nare still visible in each of these matched-resolution maps. This is particularly important for\nthe August 2002 RM image, which was made from data obtained at 15\u201343 GHz, rather than\n5\u201315 GHz, and so had an intrinsically appreciably higher resolution.\nAs in Fig. 4, the transverse RM gradient is visible essentially all along the VLBI structure,\nout to nearly 3 mas from the core. The distances from the core where the transverse RM\ngradient is most clearly visible in the remaining two matched resolution images are roughly\n1.5 \u2212 2.0 mas in April 1997 and 2.0 \u2212 2.5 mas in August 2003; in the June 2000 RM map of\nZavala & Taylor (2003), the RM gradient is most prominent 3 \u2212 4 mas from the core. (Note\nthat we do not have access to the actual June 2000 RM map of Zavala & Taylor (2003)\n\n\f18\n\nM. Mahmud, D. C. Gabuzda & V. Bezrukovs\n\nin electronic form, and so our ability to analyze this image and compare it with the other\nimages considered is quite limited.)\nThe April 1997, June 2000 and August 2003 RM maps all have similar intrinsic resolutions, and so the positions where the transverse RM gradients are most clearly visible can be\nmeaningfully compared. However, we see no clear evidence for systematic movement of the\nobserved RM patterns either toward or away from the VLBI core over the time covered by\nthese epochs: the distances from the core are 1.5 \u2212 2.0 mas in April 1997, 3 \u2212 4 mas in June\n2000, and 2.0 \u2212 2.5 mas in August 2003. This is not entirely surprising, since the separation\nbetween our epochs may not be well matched to the time scales on which the RM patterns\nevolve and/or propagate. For example, if the RM pattern moves with a proper motion of\nseveral tenths of a mas per year (typical of superluminal motions in AGN with redshifts\nsimilar to B1803+784), it could move and evolve substantially over the three-year intervals\nfrom April 1997 to June 2000 and from June 2000 to August 2003, making it difficult to track\nthe pattern. At the same time, the general region of the transverse RM gradient is also near\nthe location of a long-lived quasi-stationary feature in the jet of B1803+784, approximately\n1.5 mas from the VLBI core (e.g. Kellermann et al. 2004; Gabuzda & Chernetskii 2003).\nDepending on the origin of this quasi-stationary feature, it may be that RM patterns in this\nregion will also display very low apparent speeds along the jet. More frequent multi-frequency\nmonitoring of this AGN with polarization VLBI could provide additional information about\nthe evolution of the RM structure on parsec scales, which could potentially provide firmer\nconstraints on possible models for the origin of the observed RM gradient and its evolution.\n\n5\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nWe have detected transverse RM gradients across the VLBI jet of B1803+784 at three\ndifferent epochs; a transverse RM gradient is also visible in the RM distribution for this\nAGN published by Zavala & Taylor (2003). The presence of a transverse RM gradient across\nthe jet at four different epochs spanning about 7 years provides firm evidence for a helical\nB field associated with this jet.\nUnexpectedly, a comparison of the RM gradients for these 4 epochs shows a clear reversal\nof the direction of the gradient between June 2000 and August 2002. This is not accompanied\nby any obvious change in the jet intensity or polarisation structure.\nThe origin for this observed \"flip\" in the direction of the transverse RM gradient in\n\n\fFaraday Rotation Gradients in B1803+784\n\n19\n\nthe jet of B1803+784 is not clear. We have suggested several scenarios that could give\npotentially rise to this phenomenon: (i) a reversal of the direction of the poloidal component\nof the intrinsic magnetic field of the central black hole; (ii) a reversal of the direction of\nthe azimuthal field component associated with torsional oscillations of the jet; and (iii) a\nchange in whether the \"inner\" or \"outer\" region of helical magnetic field dominates the\ntotal observed RM in a magnetic-tower picture. Although it is not possible at this stage to\nconclusively identify whether any of these scenarios is the origin of the observed RM-gradient\nreversal, we favour the last hypothesis, because it provides a relatively simple explanation\nfor this seemingly strange event, since a \"nested helix\" structure for the jet magnetic field\nis a natural outcome of magnetic-tower models.\nFurther multi-frequency polarization studies of this source are clearly crucial for our\nunderstanding of how the transverse Faraday Rotation gradients evolve over time and with\ndistance from the core. Higher resolution multi-frequency VLBI polarization studies can be\nused to study transverse RM gradients within the observed VLBI core in more detail, as\nis demonstrated by our 15\u201343 GHz RM image. We have recently obtained further VLBA\npolarization observations of B1803+784 at 5\u201343 GHz, which we hope will enable us to trace\nthe behaviour of the RM distribution over a wider range of distances along the jet, all at\na single epoch. Numerical studies to determine the feasibility of various scenarios for the\nreversal of the transverse RM gradient would also be of considerable interest, and are planned\nas part of our continuing work in this area.\n\n6\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\nThe research for this publication was financially supported by a Basic Research Grant from\nScience Foundation Ireland.

This fact must be taken into account when comparing RM values at different\npoints in an image and their uncertainties in order to estimate the significance of observed\nRM gradients. For this reason, we have estimated the uncertainties in the RM values at a\ngiven location in the map in Fig. 7 purely from the rms deviation of the RM values in a\n3 \u00d7 3-pixel area surrounding this location, rather than using the formal uncertainties from\nthe fits yielding the RM values, since the latter will be affected by possible inaccuracies in\nthe EVPA calibrations.\n\n\f"}
