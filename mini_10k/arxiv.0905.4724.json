Subsequent work demonstrated that the mechanism could be generalized to take place\nbetween a rank-2 antisymmetric tensor field 2 (generated by the body of a relativistic string) that\ninteracts with a vector field (produced by the end-points).3,4 Originally both the scalar-vector and\nvector-tensor developments assumed a space-time dimensionality D = 4. For this value of D a\nmassless vector has two degrees of freedom, due to its gauge invariance, while an antisymmetric\ntensor has only one, due to its corresponding gauge invariance.5 Interestingly, the set of\ngeneralized gauge invariance of the antisymmetric tensor contains the vector gauge\ntransformations as a subset (nesting).6\nEvidently, tensor field properties vary with D. In particular, easing the D = 4 limitation to allow\nhigher dimensions, produces higher rank fields and allows increased field degrees of freedom for\na given rank. Furthermore, since formal gauge properties continue, including nesting, the Higgs\nmechanism consistently and formally generalizes as well.\nThese new results are significant because they testify to the possibility of a set of tensor Higgs\nmechanisms in nature. This possibility suggests the experimental search for the Higgs boson7\ncould be a broader one. Furthermore, since the possible existence and properties of these higher\nrank tensor fields depends explicitly on the number of space-time dimensions, their discovery (or\nnot) may also help in understanding the roll of compactified higher dimensions in the physics.\n\nII.\n\nTENSOR HIGGS MECHANISM\n\nThe usual Higgs mechanism in D space-time dimensions proceeds through a field theoretic\naction such as8\n\nS( 0,1) = \u03ba D \u222b d D x ( \u2212 14 F \u03bc\u03bd F\u03bc\u03bd + 12 \u2202 \u03bc A \u2202 \u03bc A + m1 A\u03bd \u2202\u03bd A + 12 m12 A\u03bc A\u03bc ) .\n*\n\nElectronic address: mkalb@fdu.edu\n\n1\n\n(2.1)\n\n\fHere a vector field, A\u03bc , interacts with a scalar field, A, which ultimately is consumed by the\nvector. The vector then acquires a mass m1 .9,10 The argument begins by noting that the action\ndisplays a joint local gauge invariance under infinitesimal transformations given by\n\n\u03b4 A\u03bc = \u2202 \u03bc \u03bb ,\n\n(2.2)\n\n\u03b4 A = m1\u03bb + c.\n\nHere \u03bb is the local gauge parameter, and c is a constant representing the global part of the\ntransformation. Next we proceed by noting that the last three terms of the action can be rewritten\nas 12 m12 B \u03bc B\u03bc .\nWhere\n1\nB \u03bc \u2261 A\u03bc + \u2202 \u03bc A .\n(2.3)\nm1\nFinally, the action becomes\n\nS( 0,1) = \u03ba D \u222b d D x ( \u2212 14 G \u03bc\u03bd G\u03bc\u03bd + 12 m12 B \u03bc B\u03bc ) .\n\n(2.4)\n\nG \u03bc\u03bd \u2261 \u2202 \u03bc B\u03bd \u2212 \u2202\u03bd B \u03bc = F \u03bc\u03bd .\n\n(2.5)\n\nWhere\n\nExtremizing this action leads to a Klein-Gordon equation for B \u03bc with mass m1 .\nOur generalized Higgs discussion begins by briefly examining the action for a free massless\nvector (Maxwell) potential field in D space-time dimensions.\n\nS(1) = \u03ba D \u222b d D x ( \u2212 14 F \u03bc\u03bd F\u03bc\u03bd ) .\n\n(2.6)\n\nF \u03bc\u03bd \u2261 \u2202 \u03bc A\u03bd \u2212 \u2202\u03bd A\u03bc\n\n(2.7)\n\nHere\n\nis the antisymmetric tensor field strength obtained from the vector potential A\u03bc . Finding an\nextremum of the action under the variation \u03b4 A\u03bd leads to the Euler-Lagrange equations,\n\n\u2202 \u03bc F \u03bc\u03bd = 0 .\n\n(2.8)\n\nThe highlight of this field theory is the local gauge invariance of the action (2.6). Thus, if 11\n\n\u03b4 A\u03bc = \u2202 \u03bc \u03bb ,\n\n(2.9)\n\n\u03b4 F \u03bc\u03bd = 0,\n\n(2.10)\n\nthen\nand\n\n2\n\n\f\u03b4 S(1) = 0 .\n\n(2.11)\n\nNext we study analogously the action for a free massless antisymmetric tensor potential field,\nA\u03bc\u03bd ( = \u2212 A\u03bd\u03bc ) , in D space-time dimensions.12\n\nS( 2) = \u03ba D \u222b d D x ( 16 F \u03bc\u03bd\u03c1 F\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1 ) .\n\n(2.12)\n\nF \u03bc\u03bd\u03c1 \u2261 \u2202 \u03bc A\u03bd\u03c1 + \u2202\u03bd A\u03c1\u03bc + \u2202 \u03c1 A\u03bc\u03bd\n\n(2.13)\n\nHere\n\nis the fully antisymmetric third rank tensor field strength obtained from the antisymmetric tensor\npotential. Finding an extremum of the action (2.12) under the variation \u03b4 A\u03bd\u03c1 leads to EulerLagrange equations which parallel (2.8),\n\n\u2202 \u03bc F \u03bc\u03bd\u03c1 = 0 .\n\n(2.14)\n\nThe highlight of the antisymmetric tensor field theoretic action is the local gauge invariance.\nThus, if 13\n\n\u03b4 A\u03bc\u03bd = \u2202 \u03bc \u03bb\u03bd \u2212 \u2202\u03bd \u03bb \u03bc ,\n\n(2.15)\n\n\u03b4 F \u03bc\u03bd\u03c1 = 0 ,\n\n(2.16)\n\n\u03b4 S( 2 ) = 0 .\n\n(2.17)\n\nthen\nand\n\nNow consider adding analogous self-interaction terms to S(1) and S( 2) respectively:\n\nand\n\nS m 1 = \u03ba D \u222b d D x ( \u2212 12 m12 A\u03bc A\u03bc ) ,\n\n(2.18)\n\nS m 2 = \u03ba D \u222b d D x ( 12 m22 A\u03bc\u03bd A\u03bc\u03bd ) .\n\n(2.19)\n\n14\n\nSimply added to their corresponding massless actions, these terms lead to Euler-Lagrange\nequations which describe a modified space-time field evolution.\nTo carry analogy to the traditional Higgs mechanism further and obtain an analogous action to\n(2.1) for A\u03bc\u03bd requires the definition of a combined field theoretic action that describes the\npropagation of, as well as the interaction between, a vector field and an antisymmetric tensor\nfield. Also, let us only include a mass-like term for A\u03bc\u03bd . An analogous candidate action is given\nby\n\nS(1,2 ) = \u03ba D \u222b d D x ( 16 F \u03bc\u03bd\u03c1 F\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1 \u2212 14 F \u03bc\u03bd F\u03bc\u03bd + gA\u03bc\u03bd F\u03bc\u03bd \u2212 12 m22 A\u03bc\u03bd A\u03bc\u03bd ) .\n\n3\n\n(2.20)\n\n\fHere g is the coupling constant for the interaction between the vector field strength F\u03bc\u03bd and the\nantisymmetric tensor potential field A\u03bc\u03bd . The generalized Higgs mechanism consists of\npostulating the continued invariance of the action S(1,2 ) under a combined gauge transformation\nof both potentials A\u03bc and A\u03bc\u03bd . However, although we retain the form of the gauge\ntransformation for A\u03bc\u03bd from (2.15), we modify that of A\u03bc from (2.9). The modification, in this\ncase, is chosen to allow the vector to be \"eaten\" by the antisymmetric tensor A\u03bc\u03bd while\nsimultaneously causing it have mass m2 , by way of satisfying a Klein-Gordon equation.\nConsider therefore the following set of joint transformations parameterized by \u03bb \u03bc , \u03bb , and a\nconstant15 b\n\n\u03b4 A\u03bc\u03bd = \u2202 \u03bc \u03bb\u03bd \u2212 \u2202\u03bd \u03bb \u03bc ,\n\u03b4 A\u03bc = b\u03bb \u03bc + \u2202 \u03bc \u03bb .\n\n(2.21)\n(2.22)\n\nIf we choose\n\ng = \u2212 m2\n\n2,\n\n(2.23)\n\nand joint transformations with\n\nb = m2\n\n2,\n\n(2.24)\n\nwe obtain\n\n\u03b4 S(1,2) = 0 .\n\n(2.25)\n\nNow, in general, the part of \u03bb \u03bc that is expressible as a gradient does not contribute to (2.21) and\nmay be absorbed into the gradient part of (2.22). Furthermore, the gradient part of A\u03bc does not\ncontribute to the action because S(1,2 ) only depends on A\u03bc through F \u03bc\u03bd .\nNow let\n\n2 \u03bc\u03bd\nF .\nm1\nThus, the action may be rewritten as\nB \u03bc\u03bd \u2261 A\u03bc\u03bd +\n\n(2.26)\n\nS(1,2 ) = \u03ba D \u222b d D x ( 16 G \u03bc\u03bd\u03c1 G\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1 \u2212 12 m22 B \u03bc\u03bd B\u03bc\u03bd ) .\n\n(2.27)\n\nG \u03bc\u03bd\u03c1 \u2261 \u2202 \u03bc B\u03bd\u03c1 + \u2202\u03bd B \u03c1\u03bc + \u2202 \u03c1 B \u03bc\u03bd = F \u03bc\u03bd\u03c1 .\n\n(2.28)\n\nWhere\n\n4\n\n\fFrom (2.27), the Euler-Lagrange equations of motion for B\u03bd\u03c1 are\n\n\u2202 \u03bc \u2202 \u03bc B\u03bd\u03c1 + m22 B\u03bd\u03c1 = 0 ,\n\n(2.29)\n\nwith Lorentz condition\n\n\u2202 \u03bc B \u03bc\u03bd = 0 .\n\n(2.30)\n\nThus, an antisymmetric tensor potential field remains with a mass equal to m2 , is free of\ninteractions, obeys the Lorentz condition, and the vector potential has been consumed.\nThe original discovery of this mechanism, as applied to vector and rank-2 antisymmetric tensor\nfield, was accomplished in a hybrid theory involving fields mediating direct inter-string\ninteractions between string bodies, including end-points.16 We see here that the field theoretic\nprocess can stand alone provided that an appropriate partial action such as (2.20) is postulated.\nThe result is also seen as completely analogous to the original scalar-vector Higgs mechanism\nfor which the corresponding action is given in (2.1). We note in passing the feature of additional\nfreedom due to the \"nested\" gauge transformation parameterized by \u03bb .\nGiven the above developments coming from the study of S( 0,1) (scalar/vector mechanism) and\nS(1,2 ) (vector/rank-2 antisymmetric tensor mechanism), we are led to consider actions containing\nstill higher rank antisymmetric tensors and their corresponding Higgs mechanisms. Furthermore,\nthe existence and properties of these actions, along with the two already studied, depend on the\nspace-time dimensions in which they live. For example, if D = 4 we in principle also need to\nconsider the mechanism in the action S( 2,3) . However, note that antisymmetric tensors (potentials\nor force fields) of rank higher than 4 cannot exist in a D = 4 space-time; thus, S( 2,3) terminates\nthe action sequence. In order to study S( 2,3) , we postulate the 3rd rank antisymmetric tensor\npotential field A\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1 and its corresponding tensor force field F \u03bc\u03bd\u03c1\u03c3 and proceed as before.

Each field\nstrength tensor carries a gauge invariance, and each gauge invariance has its own nested\ninvariance because of its antisymmetric form; mn is the mass value that each mechanism\nproduces, which at this point may be different for each mechanism action. Notice that the\ninteraction term contains a factor of 1 n , and the Levi-Civita densities are each shown\nexplicitly with D suffixes. Observe, finally, that as D increases, the number of fields and their\nrespective number of indices increases as well. Thus, additional interactions may be\ncontemplated, and A D may indeed be a subset of a more complete set of invariant actions\ndisplaying the Higgs mechanisms.\n\nIII.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nThe preceding developments have focused on the interesting physics of antisymmetric tensor\nfield theories. The prototype rank-2 version, originally discovered as an interaction potential\nbetween the bodies of relativistic strings in D = 4, was itself motivated by analogy with the\nMaxwell-vector (rank-1) interaction between point particles. We have further defined rank-n\nantisymmetric tensors in D-dimensional space-times. However, the tensors require n < D to\nproduce a nontrivial theory. This relates directly to the association of each rank-n antisymmetric\ntensor with a geometric object [ ( n \u2212 1) -brane], whose world-volume has dimension n. An object\nwith D dimensions is trivial since the corresponding field strength vanishes \u2013 there is no space\nfor dynamics.\nWe also observed that each field strength Lorentz tensor remains invariant under a set of internal\nsymmetry transformations of its underlying potentials. In the rank-1 case this is just ordinary\n6\n\n\fMaxwell gauge invariance, and we described the generalized notion of gauge invariance to the\nhigher rank cases. It is intriguing that these gauge invariances nest rank-by-rank.\nWith the tensor field sequences, ranks, and the gauge invariances established, we found that\ncombining any two sequential field theories, supplemented by a manifestly relativistically\ninvariant coupling term containing the field strength of one and the potential field of the other,\nproduced an action subject to a generalized Higgs mechanism. Clearly, the number of such\nactions depends on the postulated dimension of space-time. As expected, each action described a\nmassive field theory of the higher rank antisymmetric field therein contained, along with a\nLorentz condition. The interacting lower ranked field was consumed.\nGoing forward, in order to abstract further field theoretic behaviors, we would find it useful to\nadd additional terms that maintain the generalized gauge invariance of the actions. Moreover, it\nwould be interesting to construct invariant actions that contain three or more fields, even perhaps\nthe entire sequence for a given space-time dimension. If some of the higher space-time\ndimensions were compactified, how would these actions behave, and would artifacts of these\ndimensions remain? Finally, what do these developments imply regarding the properties of\nsubmicroscopic matter and energy as might be measured in future experiments?\nWe thank Joshua Kalb and Robert Shaw for useful conversations and comments.\n1\n\nE.
