Despite its success there are some points in the\nmodel as, for instance, the enormous range of masses between the lightest and heaviest fermions and other peculiarities that could be better explained at a deeper level.\nThe nature of the Higgs boson is one of the most important problems in particle physics, and there are many\nquestions that may be answered in the near future by\nthe LHC experiments, such as: Is the Higgs boson, if\nit exists at all, elementary or composite? What are the\nsymmetries behind the Higgs mechanism?\nThe possibility that the Higgs boson is a composite state instead of an elementary one is more akin\nto the phenomenon of spontaneous symmetry breaking\nthat originated from the effective Ginzburg-Landau Lagrangian, which can be derived from the microscopic BCS\ntheory of superconductivity describing the electron-hole\ninteraction (or the composite state in our case). This\ndynamical origin of the spontaneous symmetry breaking\nhas been discussed with the use of many models, the\nmost popular one being the technicolor (TC) model [1].\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\naddress: agomes@utfpr.edu.br\naddress: natale@ift.unesp.br\n\u2021 Electronic address: psilva@fisica.ufpb.br\n\u2020 Electronic\n\nUnfortunately we do not know the dynamics that form\nthe scalar bound state, which should play the role of the\nHiggs boson in the standard model symmetry breaking,\nand no phenomenologically satisfactory model along this\nline has been derived up to now.\nMost of the models for the spontaneous symmetry\nbreaking of the standard model based on the composite Higgs boson system depends on specific assumptions\nabout the theory particle content and consequently on\nthe dynamics responsible for the bound state formation [2], and one of the questions that we address in this\nwork is how can we make predictions about the effective Higgs Lagrangian without assuming specific models\nor dynamics? In principle, new fermions are bounded\nby a new interaction stronger than QCD and originate a\ncomposite scalar state whose wave function is a solution\nof the Bethe-Salpeter equation. In non-Abelian gauge\ntheories this wave function (or the Bethe-Salpeter kernel \u03a6BS (p, q)) is related to the self-energy of the new\nfermions [3]\n\u03a3(p2 ) = \u03a6BS (p, q)|q\u21920 ,\n\n(1)\n\nand here we shall assume for this self-energy (\u03a3(p, \u03b1)) a\nvery general expression that interpolates between all possible scalar wave functions (or all possible non-Abelian\ngauge group dynamics) as we vary a specific parameter\n(\u03b1) present in this function [4]. When this parameter\ngoes to 1 we obtain a fermionic self-energy that behaves\nas \u03a3(p2 ) \u221d \u039b3 /p2 , which is the usual operator product\nexpansion (OPE) behavior for a gauge theory that develops a dynamical mass scale \u039b [5]. When \u03b1 \u2192 0 the\n\n\f2\nself-energy is the one that appears in the extreme walking\ntechnicolor theories [6]. Using this self-energy ansatz we\ncan study several properties of the composite Higgs boson in a model independent way [7], as we choose the free\nparameter (\u03b1) which defines the theory to be considered.\nObserve that Eq.(1) shows that there is formal relation\nbetween the fermion self-energy (\u03a3(p2 )) and the scalar\nboson wave function. In principle this means that if we\nknow \u03a3(p2 ) we know all the properties of the scalar boson. However we must keep in mind that the calculation\nof the effective action is not performed with an exact\nexpression for the self-energy (or scalar wave function),\nbut with a simple approximation of this function which\nobeys the leading order solution of the Schwinger-Dyson\nequation (SDE) for the fermion propagator. By leading\norder SDE in the case of non-Abelian gauge theories we\nunderstand that the SDE are solved using as input the\nbare gauge boson propagator and solely the effect of the\nrunning coupling in the vertex function. This approximation is usually assumed as reasonable and has already\nbeen tested at higher order for walking technicolor theories [8]. On the other hand we also point out that the\neffective action is a dressed loop expansion, which is able\nto capture the nonlinearities of the dynamical symmetry\nbreaking under a controllable approximation, as shown\nby Cornwall and Shellard in Ref. [9], but if we neglect\nthe next order of the loop expansion and consider the\nleading order and simple approximation for the fermionic\nself-energy we will surely have an uncertainty in the boson masses and couplings that we quote.\nWith the general self-energy (or composite state wave\nfunction) we can compute an effective action (\u03a9) for composite operators [10] of the effective Higgs system, which\nis a type of calculation already performed for several specific models (see, for instance, Ref. [11, 12]). However the\neffective potential has not been computed up to now with\nthe general self-energy ansatz that we referred to above.\nMoreover, the effective potential by itself does not give\nthe full information about the composite Higgs system.\nThe effective action contains a kinetic term, which, as\ndemonstrated by Cornwall and Shellard [9], has the form\nZ\n1\n[\u2202\u03bc \u03c6(x)]2\n\u03a9K =\n,\n(2)\nd4 x\n2\n\u03ba\nwhere \u03c6 is related to the composite wave-function and to\nobtain a conventional kinetic term we define\n\u03a6(x) = Z \u22121/2 \u03c6(x) ,\n\n(3)\n\nwhere \u03a6 plays the role of the physical field and Z = \u03ba\nacts as a renormalization constant. The constant Z is important to set the right scale in our \"Ginzburg-Landau\"\neffective Lagrangian, actually it will be fundamental to\nthe results in order to provide the right values of the\ncomposite scalar boson mass and self-coupling constants.\nThis effective Lagrangian will be useful to set limits on\nthe composite Higgs boson system in a quite general way,\nand it will be given by \u03a9 which is composed by the kinetic\n\nterm \u03a9K and the effective potential part \u03a9V . Another\npoint that, as far as we know, has not been extensively\ndiscussed in the literature and we discuss here are the different contributions to the effective potential that come\nfrom the new fermions that form the scalar composite\nstate, and the ones that come from ordinary fermions.\nBoth contributions are responsible, as we shall see, for\ndetermining the value of the composite Higgs boson mass\nwhich, as our result indicates, can be as light as few hundreds GeV, corroborating the results of Ref. [13].\nThis paper is organized as follows: In Sec. II we discuss the effective potential for composite operators and\nhow the kinetic term of the effective action is generated\nthrough the use of the general self-energy ansatz. Sec.\nIII contains the actual calculation of the effective action.\nIn Sec. IV we gather our results and compute the Higgs\nboson masses, and in Sec. V we draw our conclusions.\nII.\n\nEFFECTIVE ACTION AND FERMION\nSELF-ENERGY\n\nThe effective action for composite operators [10] (\u0393\u0304),\nis a function of the Green functions Gi , and is stationary\nwith respect to variations of Gi :\n\u03b4 \u0393\u0304\n= 0.\n\u03b4Gi\nThe effective potential is defined by\nZ\nV (Gi ) d4 x = \u2212 \u0393\u0304(Gi ) translation invariant .\n\n(4)\n\n(5)\n\nIn terms of the complete fermion (S) and gauge boson\n(D) propagators, V (Gi ) can be written as\nZ\n\u0001\nd4 p\nV (S, D) = \u2212i\nT r ln S0\u22121 S \u2212 S0\u22121 S + 1\n4\n(2\u03c0)\n+V2 (S, D) ,\n(6)\nwhere S0 (and D0 ) stands for the bare fermion (gauge\nboson) propagator.\nV2 (S, D) is the sum of all two-particle irreducible vacuum diagrams. The only contribution that we shall consider to V2 (S, D) is the one depicted in Fig.(1), and the\nequation\n\u03b4V\n= 0,\n\u03b4S\n\n(7)\n\ngives the SDE for the fermion propagator. We are not\nconsidering contributions to the potential due to gauge\nand ghosts loops, because we are interested only in the\nfermionic bilinear condensation in the scalar channel,\nkeeping in mind that we should consider a non-Abelian\ngauge theory, stronger than QCD, whose fermions form\nthe composite Higgs boson. Of course, we are also not\nconsidering the possibility of gauge boson mass generation in this non-Abelian theory, as may happen in\n\n\f3\nQCD [14], that could imply only in a change of the potential value at the minimum, but not in the symmetry\nbreaking pattern of the effective Higgs theory.\n\nV2 (S; D )\n\n=\n\nIn the above expression \u039b is the characteristic scale of\nmass generation of the theory forming the composite\nHiggs boson, which hereafter will be identified with the\nTC scale, \u039bT C . b is the coefficient of the g 3 term in the\nrenormalization group \u03b2 function, \u03b3 = 3c/16\u03c0 2b, and c\nis the quadratic Casimir operator given by\n\n1\n2\n\nFIG. 1: Two-particle irreducible contribution to the vacuum\nenergy.\n\nWe can represent V2 (S, D) analytically in the HartreeFock approximation by\n1\niV2 (S, D) = \u2212 T r(\u0393S\u0393SD) ,\n2\n\n(8)\n\nwhere \u0393 is the fermion proper vertex. In Eq.(8) we have\nnot written the gauge and Lorentz indices, as well as the\nmomentum integrals.\nThe physically meaningful quantity that we must compute is the vacuum energy density given by\n\u03a9V = V (S, D) \u2212 V (S0 , D0 ) ,\n\n(9)\n\nwhere we are subtracting the symmetric part of the potential from the potential that admits condensation in\nthe scalar channel, that is denoted by V (S0 , D0 ) and is\na function of the perturbative propagators (S0 and D0 ),\nwhere the complete propagator S is related to the free\npropagator by\nS \u22121 = S0\u22121 \u2212 \u03a3 ,\n\n(10)\n\nwhere S0 = i/ 6 p.\nThe vacuum energy density, if we remove all indices\nand integrations, can be written as [10, 12]\n\u03a9V = \u2212iT r(ln S0\u22121 S \u2212 S0\u22121 S + 1) + iT r\u03a3(S \u2212 S0 )\n1\n(11)\n+ iT r(\u0393S\u0393S \u2212 \u0393S0 \u0393S0 )D .\n2\nUsing Eq.(10) and assuming \u03a3S0 small, it is possible to\nexpand \u03a9V in powers of \u03a3, that gives [10, 12]\n\u03a9V\n\n1\n= iT r ln(1 \u2212 \u03a3S0 ) + iT r\u03a3S0 \u03a3S0\n2\n1\n+ iT rS0 \u03a3S0 \u03a3S0 \u0393S0 \u03a3S0 \u03a3S0 \u0393D0 .\n2\n\nWe parametrize the self-energy \u03a3 as [4]\n\u0012 2 \u0013\u03b1\n\u0001\u0003\u2212\u03b3 cos(\u03b1\u03c0)\n\u0002\n\u039b\n2\n\u03a3(p ) \u223c \u039b\n. (13)\n1 + bg 2 ln p2 /\u039b2\n2\np\n\nc=\n\n1\n[C2 (R1 ) + C2 (R1 ) \u2212 C2 (R3 )] ,\n2\n\nwhere C2 (Ri ), are the Casimir operators for fermions in\nthe representations R1 and R2 that form a composite\nboson in the representation R3 . The only restriction on\nthis ansatz is \u03b3 > 1/2 [5], and if we consider the formal\nequivalence between the solution of the SDE with the\nBethe-Salpeter one for scalar bound states, the above\nrestriction indicates a condition on the composite wavefunction normalization.\nThe ansatz in Eq.(13), proposed in Ref. [4], interpolates between the standard OPE result for the technifermion self-energy, which is obtained when \u03b1 \u2192 1,\nand the extreme walking technicolor solution obtained\nwhen \u03b1 \u2192 0 [6], i.e., this is the case where the symmetry\nbreaking is dominated by higher order interactions that\nare relevant at or above the TC scale, leading naturally to\na very hard dynamics [16, 17]. As two of us have pointed\nout in Ref. [7] only such kind of solution is naturally capable of generating a large mass to the third fermionic\ngeneration, which has a mass limit almost saturated by\nthe top quark mass. This variation of the ansatz with\n\u03b1 is what makes our calculation a general one; it covers all possible solutions of the SDE (or Bethe-Salpeter\nequation) for fermions forming the composite boson.\nWe can now determine a complete effective theory (or\nthe Ginzburg-Landau Lagrangian), including the kinetic\nterm of the effective action. To start with, let us suppose that the real vacuum leads to fermion condensation\nand denote the true ground state by |\u03a9i.

In\nmodels based on the technicolor idea, the composite\nscalar boson is made of these new fermions only. Of\ncourse there are models like topcolor [19] where the top\nquark has a strong interaction such as it could supply the\nscalar composite necessary to the dynamical symmetry\nbreaking of the electroweak theory. This last possibility\nwould change the contributions that we should consider\nto the potential, but as there is no observed signal in\nthe top quark physics up to now indicating such a possibility, we do not follow this path and consider that our\ncomposite state is formed only by new fermionic degrees\nof freedom. However, even in this case we still have other\ncontributions to the effective Lagrangian. The contributions that we are referring to are the ones coming from\nordinary massive quarks and leptons that couple to the\nscalar boson. These contributions will be dominated by\nthe heaviest fermion (the top quark) and will generate\nterms of order \u03c63 , \u03c64 , and higher as will be discussed in\nthe sequence.\nThe \u03c63 and \u03c64 contributions to the effective Lagrangian due to the ordinary massive fermions are given,\nrespectively, by the diagrams of Figs. 3 and 4, where\nthe effective f f \u03c6 coupling is determined through Ward\nidentities as discussed in Refs. [16, 17, 20], and it is easy\nto verify that such a coupling will be given by\n\u0131\u03bb\u03c6f f \u221d \u2212\u0131\n\ngW \u03a3f (k)\n.\n2MW\n\n(30)\n\nNotice that the ordinary fermions masses in composite Higgs models come from a new type of interaction,\nthat in the most common approach is called extended\ntechnicolor interaction (ETC). As we do not know the\ndynamics (or model) for this specific interaction, we cannot formally derive their contribution to the effective action. However, we can compute the effect of ordinary\nfermions to the effective potential as a function of their\nmasses, exactly as performed by Carpenter et al. [21].\nThese contributions are expected to be small, since the\n\nf\n\n\u03c6\n\n\u03c6\n\nf\n\nf\n\n\u03c6\n\nFIG. 3: Heavy ordinary fermions (f ) contribution to the trilinear composite (\u03c6) Higgs boson coupling.

Notice that if we change the dynamics of the\ntheory we cannot obtain F\u03a02 just with a simple scaled\nQCD. Another interesting fact is also the relation between F\u03a02 and Z (\u03b1) . Since the fields in the effective Lagrangian are normalized by different powers of Z (\u03b1) (or\npowers of F\u03a02 , that also varies with \u03b1), and since F\u03a02 is\nfixed by the weak gauge boson masses, we verified that\nthe behavior of the effective theory is quite different according to the different limits of the \u03b1 parameter.\n\nRESULTS\n\n(0)\n\n\u03bb4V\n\n(0)\n\n\u03bb4f\n\n(NT C nF )3\n\u2248\n12(16\u03c0 2 \u03b2(2\u03b3 \u2212 1))2\n\n\u0012\n\n\u039bT C\nmt\n\n\u00134\n\n.\n\n(43)\n\nThe \u03b2(2\u03b3 \u2212 1) factor appearing in the denominator is\nusually of O(1) for several gauge groups.

The shaded band is the experimentally excluded region [25].\n\nWith Eq.(46) we can compute numerically the Higgs\nboson mass in the extreme walking behavior (\u03b1 \u2192 0)\nand the result is plotted in Fig.(5). Notice that as we go\nto larger values of NT C while keeping a slowly TC running coupling constant (a \u03b2T C function close to zero) we\nverify that the current experimental limit on the Higgs\nboson mass does not allow us to have a technicolor gauge\ngroup arbitrarily large (NT C < 10). The possibility that\na composite Higgs boson can be as light as the present\nexperimental limit has been already noticed in a series of\npapers [13]. The authors of these papers particularly discuss a more interesting case where the walking behavior is\nobtained in theories where the fermions are in higher dimensional representations of the technicolor group, turning unnecessary the introduction of a quite large number\nof fermions, as happens in the case where the fermions\nare in the fundamental representation. Moreover, it was\nalso shown that exactly for the extreme walking case\nthese theories, with a light composite Higgs, are totally\nin agreement with the precision electroweak measurements [13]. In obtaining Fig.(5) we have used the \u03b2\nfunction up to two loops, where nF for each SU (NT C )\nhas to be fixed accordingly, i.e., nF = 8, 11, 14, ... for\nNT C = 2, 3, 4, ...\nConsidering the smallest possible non-Abelian unitary\ntechnicolor gauge group, i.e. SU (2)T C , we can observe\nfrom Fig.(5) that, in the extreme walking regime, the\nHiggs boson mass has an upper limit of about O(700)\nGeV. In order to have models with dynamical symmetry\nbreaking along the technicolor idea without the problems\nof neutral flavor changing currents, the walking scenario\nseems to be the most promising possibility [6]. In this\ncontext our result implies a crucial test for the walking technicolor hypothesis since such mass values may be\npromptly assessed at LHC.\n(\u03b1)\n\nLet us consider the limit \u03bb3f R \u2192 0.

The points that we have chosen in Fig.(6)\ncorrespond to extreme walking technicolor theories, and\nwe expect the possible range of couplings and masses for\nother \u03b1 values to be located between these points and\nthe standard model curve [7].\nFinally, in the limit \u03b1 \u2192 1 we simply obtain scalar boson masses in the TeV region as usual, but these models\nare known to be plagued by unwanted flavor changing\nneutral currents.\n\nV.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nWe have computed an effective action for a composite\nHiggs boson system formed by new fermions belonging\nto a general technicolor non-Abelian gauge theory. The\ncalculation is based on an effective action for composite\noperators. The novelty is that the effective action is computed with the help of a quite general self-energy that depends on a certain parameter (\u03b1), which, when variated\nfrom 0 to 1, provides an interpolation of the fermionic\nself-energy from the extreme walking technicolor behav-\n\n\f8\nior up to the self-energy expression that obeys the standard operator product expansion. This means that our\ncalculation is quite general in the sense that choosing\nvalues for \u03b1, which is equivalent to choosing different dynamics for the strong interaction forming the composite\nscalar boson, we can obtain the different mass and couplings of the effective theory.\nThere are two other improvements in our calculation.\nThe first one is the calculation of the kinetic term of\nthe effective theory. This term appears with a coefficient\nthat differs from the standard parametrization of the kinetic term of a scalar Lagrangian. When the effective\nLagrangian is normalized to reproduce a standard scalar\neffective field theory we also must modify the remaining\nterms, leading to a nontrivial change of the scalar selfcouplings. The second improvement is that we also consider the effect of ordinary massive fermions to the effective Lagrangian. This contribution is usually neglected,\nand is indeed small except by the contribution of the\nheavy top quark. An ordinary massive fermion contribution is also important because it introduces odd powers of\nscalar field self-couplings in the theory, i.e., the trilinear\ncomposite scalar self-coupling is originated from the loop\nof the top quark, while the quadrilinear self-coupling is\ndominated by the techniquarks interactions as well as, in\na minor extent, from the top quark loop contribution. Of\ncourse, this result would change if there is a fourth ordinary fermion family or if the techniquarks have a large\ncurrent mass (above the TC scale).\nWith the general fermionic self-energy (or composite state wave function) we computed the effective Lagrangian presenting the results for \u03b1 = 0 and \u03b1 = 1,\nwhich correspond to the limits of the extreme walking\ntechnicolor theory and the standard view of the technicolor theory that can be obtained by scaled QCD. For\nother \u03b1 values the scalar mass and self-couplings are located between the ones obtained for the extreme cases\n(0 and 1). In the case of an extreme walking behavior\n(\u03b1 \u2192 0), we obtain an upper limit for the Higgs boson mass, (MH \u2264 O(700) GeV for SU (2)T C ), and the\nexperimental data on the Higgs boson mass constrain\nSU (N )T C technicolor gauge groups to be smaller than\nSU (10)T C , whereas when \u03b1 \u2192 1 the scalar mass is expected to be much heavier. Therefore we agree with the\nearlier results of Ref. [13] that we may have quite a light\ncomposite Higgs scalar boson in the case of extreme walking TC theories.\nIt is fair to mention that another source of uncertainty\nin our approach, besides that assumed in the SDE, is that\nwe are showing results for the extreme walking behavior\n(\u03b1 \u2192 0), for which we consider the \u03b2 function up to 2\nloops. This obviously constrains the number of fermions\nintroduced in our computation of the effective potential.\nHigher loops certainly change the number of fermions\nneeded to get the walking behavior, implying a change\nin our numerical results for the triple and quartic gauge\ncouplings as well as the Higgs mass. It is possible that\ngoing to further orders of the beta function could mod-\n\nify the specific shape of the Higgs mass function shown\nin Fig.5 and shift the couplings relative to the expected\nresults of the standard model plotted in Fig.6. Given\nthe degree of approximations we have already assumed\nin computing the effective potential, we thought it was\nreasonable to truncate the beta function to the order that\nits coefficients are universal. However, it is interesting to\nnotice that a complete all orders beta function obtained\nin Ref. [24] could be used in a more general approach\nand also when different representations are considered\nand could be helpful in developing an extended analysis\nin a future work.\nIn theories where the scalar Higgs boson is composite we need new \"extended technicolor\" interactions in\norder to give masses to the ordinary fermions. As far\nas we know there is no phenomenologically viable ETC\nmodel and its effect enters in our effective Lagrangian\nparametrized in the massive ordinary fermion contributions. This contribution is important, as discussed above,\nbecause it is responsible for the trilinear scalar coupling\nand we expect that other ETC contributions decouple\nfrom the effective Lagrangian. The ordinary fermion contributions to the effective Lagrangian are roughly 1 order\nof magnitude smaller than the one of techniquarks. This\nis an expected behavior since their masses are smaller\nthan the TC mass scale.\nAt present the walking technicolor models seem to be\nthe most promising possibility for dynamically broken\ngauge theories. Therefore if this scenario is appropriate\nto describe the dynamics of symmetry breaking (with a\nunitary gauge group in the fundamental representation),\nour limit implies that the scalar composite boson should\nbe observed at LHC with a mass up to 700 GeV, a quite\ninteresting outcome considering a composite nature for\nthe Higgs boson.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThis research was partially supported by the Conselho\nNacional de Desenvolvimento Cient\u0131\u0301fico e Tecnol\u00f3gico\n(CNPq).\n\nAPPENDIX A: \u03c64 AND \u03c66 CONTRIBUTIONS TO\n\u03a9V\n\nIn this appendix we compute the \u03c64 and \u03c66 terms of\nthe effective potential \u03a9V .

We do the same calculation\nfor the case \u03b1 = 1, obtaining\n(1)\n\nThe trilinear and quadrilinear couplings that are originated from the ordinary massive fermions are obtained\nfrom the calculation of Fig.(3) and Fig.(4), respectively.\nAssuming that the coupling \u03c6f \u0304f , of the composite Higgs\nscalar boson \u03c6 to the ordinary fermions, at large momentum p2 is given by [17]\n\u03bb\u03c6f f \u2248 \u2212\n\ngW \u03a3f (p2 )\n,\n2MW\n\n\u03bb4f \u2248\n\n(\u03b1)\n\u03bb4f\n\n4\nnF N c\n1 gW\n\u2248\n64\u03c0 2 (MW )4\n\ndp2 p6 \u03a34f (p2 )\n,\n(p2 + m2f )4\n\n(B3)\n\nThe self-energy solution, in this specific limit, cannot generate large fermion masses [7] (without generating large\nflavor changing neutral currents). Therefore we can expect that (mf = mf (1) \u2248 mu ) or (mf = mf (1) \u2248 me ).\nThe trilinear self-coupling of the composite Higgs bosons\nwith the ordinary fermions can be obtained in the same\nway, and the result is\n\nwe obtain\nZ\n\n4\nm4f\n3gW\n.\n4\n64\u03c0 2 MW\n4\n\n(\u03b1)\n\u03bb3f\n\n(B1)\n\n3g 3 nF Nc 1\n\u2248 W\n(MW )3 32\u03c0 2\n\nZ\n\ndp2 p4 \u03a34f (p2 )\n.\n(p2 + m2f )3\n\n(B4)\n\nwhere for \u03b1 \u223c 0 and \u03b1 \u223c 1 we obtain\n\nwhere in this expression \u03a3f (p2 ) is parametrized by the\nansatz of Eq.(13).
