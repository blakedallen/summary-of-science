Furthermore,\nthe neutrino oscillation parameters can be extracted from the flavor dependence of the lowest-mode signals, which give us information about the origin\nof low-energy neutrino masses.\n\n\f1\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe detailed structure of lepton sector has been gradually revealed by the recent\nneutrino oscillation experiments [1, 2]. The smallness of neutrino masses is one of\nthe most important clues to find new physics beyond the standard model (SM). The\nseesaw mechanism naturally leads to small neutrino masses through heavy particles\nbeing coupled with ordinary neutrinos. In Type I seesaw scheme [3], the introduction\nof right-handed neutrinos implies intermediate mass scales to have light neutrino\nmasses of order eV, and hence these heavy states are almost decoupled in low-energy\neffective theory. Alternatively, TeV-scale right-handed neutrinos are also viable,\nwhich in turn means much smaller couplings to the SM sector and their signals would\nnot be captured in future collider experiments such as the Large Hadron Collider\n(LHC). It is therefore difficult to simultaneously realize tiny neutrino masses and\ndetectably large interactions among right-handed neutrinos and the SM particles\nwithin the framework of four-dimensional Type I seesaw.\nIn the previous work by a part of the authors [4], it was pointed out that\nthe difficulty is overcome by a simple extension of the SM. We have considered\na five-dimensional theory where all the SM fields are confined in a four-dimensional\nspace-time while right-handed neutrinos propagate in the bulk of extra-dimensional\nspace [5, 6]. With bulk Majorana mass, TeV-scale right-handed neutrinos can generate a tiny scale of neutrino masses through the seesaw mechanism and simultaneously\nhave sizable couplings to the SM leptons and gauge bosons. The previous work focused on the tri-lepton signal with large missing transverse energy pp \u2192 l\u00b1 l\u2213 l\u00b1 \u03bd(\u03bd\u0304).\n\nThis process is expected to be detectable at the LHC because only a small fraction of\n\nSM processes contributes to the background against the signals. It was shown that\nthe observation of right-handed neutrinos is possible, though it is limited only to\nthe lightest Kaluza-Klein (KK) mode of right-handed neutrinos and the mechanism\nitself seems difficult to be confirmed at the LHC.\nIn this paper, we will investigate how this scenario can be observed at the International Linear Collider (ILC). The ILC is the future electron-positron linear collider\nfor the next generation of high-energy frontier physics. At the ILC, electrons and\npositrons are accelerated by two opposing linear accelerators installed in an about\n30 km long underground tunnel, and are brought into collision with a center of\nmass energy of 500 GeV-1 TeV. The clean experimental environment of the ILC\ndue to the electron-positron collider gives us an opportunity to obtain more infor-\n\n1\n\n\fmation about the property of right-handed neutrinos and their interactions. We\nfocus on the two-jet and single lepton signal with large missing energy, e+ e\u2212 \u2192 \u03bdN\n\n(N \u2192 lW, W \u2192 q q\u0304), which can be efficiently reconstructed at the ILC and allows\n\nus to reveal not only the lightest but also higher KK-excited states of right-handed\nneutrinos. As a result, the ILC experiment can completely confirm that the scenario\n\nis based on the extra-dimensional theory. Furthermore, by observing the flavor dependence of interactions between right-handed neutrinos and SM particles, it is also\npossible to confirm the mechanism to generate the neutrino masses. We performed\nthe analysis of the signal in the various mass hierarchies of neutrino masses (the\nnormal, inverted, and degenerate cases).\nThis article is organized as follows. In the next section, we briefly review the fivedimensional theory with right-handed neutrinos. The simulation framework such as\na representative point in the parameter space of the model and the simulation tools\nused in our study are presented in Section 3. The details of analysis to observe\nthe right-handed neutrinos at the ILC are discussed in Section 4, where we show\nexpected measurement accuracies of the masses of right-handed neutrinos and their\nproduction cross-sections at the center of mass energy of 500 GeV and 1 TeV. In\nSection 5, we will discuss how the mechanism of neutrino-mass generation can be\nconfirmed at the ILC. Section 6 is devoted to summary.\n\n2\n\nPhysics Model\n\nWe consider the five-dimensional theory on S 1 /Z2 with the S 1 -radius R. The coordinates are denoted by (x\u03bc , y) where the y direction is compactified to the line\nsegment y = [0, \u03c0R]. The standard-model fields are confined on the four-dimensional\nboundary at y = 0. In addition, we introduce the bulk gauge-singlet fermions\nNi (i = 1, 2, 3) and assign the even Z2 parity to their upper components, i.e.\n\nNi (\u2212y) = \u03b35 Ni (y), so that they contain three-generation right-handed neutrinos\n\nas zero modes.1 The kinetic and mass terms are given by\ni\n1h c\n\u2032\nL = iNi D\n/ Ni \u2212\nNi (M\u03b35 + M )ij Nj + h.c. .\n2\n\n(1)\n\nt\n\nThe conjugated spinor is defined as N c = \u03b33 \u03b31 N . It is easy to also write down the\n\nDirac mass md if one introduces a Z2 -odd function which could originate from some\n1\n\nWe do not consider the possibility of generation-dependent parity assignment [7].\n\n2\n\n\ffield expectation value. In this paper, we take md = M \u2032 = 0, first considered in\nRef. [5] as a simple example of higher-dimensional seesaw models. We also have the\nmass term between bulk and boundary fields:\nLm = Ni PL mij Lj \u03b4(y) + h.c.,\n\n(2)\n\ngenerated after the electroweak symmetry breaking. The boundary fermions Li contain the left-handed neutrinos \u03bdi . Hereafter we take the basis where M is generation\ndiagonalized, and will drop other generation indices for notational simplicity.\nThe bulk fermions are KK expanded by Majorana fermions \u03a8nR,L as\nX\nX\n\u03c7nL (y)PL \u03a8nL (x).\nN (x, y) =\n\u03c7nR (y)PR\u03a8nR (x) +\nn=0\n\nThe wavefunctions\n\n\u03c7nR,L\n\n(3)\n\nn=1\n\nare normalized so that the KK-mode kinetic terms are canon-\n\nical in four dimensions. The low-energy neutrinos (e.g. singlet fermions) come from\nthe boundary neutrinos and the KK modes: (\u03bd, \u03a80R , \u03a81R , \u03a81L , \u03a82R , \u03a82L , * * * ) \u2261 (\u03bd, N).\n\nBy integrating over the fifth dimension, we obtain the Majorana mass matrix in\n\u0001\nfour-dimensional effective theory, explicitly given by 12 (\u03bd c N c )PL M N\u03bd + h.c.,\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\nmt0\nmt1\n0\n***\n0\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\nMDt\n\uf8ec m0 MR\u2217 00 MR\u2217 01 MK01 * * * \uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7 , (4)\nM = \uf8ec m1 MR10 MR11 MK11 * * * \uf8f7 \u2261 \uf8ec\n\uf8f7\nMN \uf8f8\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ed MD\nt\nt\n\uf8ec 0 MK10 MK11 ML11 * * * \uf8f7\n\uf8ed\n\uf8f8\n..\n..\n..\n..\n..\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\nwhere the boundary, KK-, and Majorana masses (mn , MK , and MR,L ) are\nZ \u03c0R\nn\nn\nmn = \u03c7R (0)m ,\nMRmn =\ndy \u03c7m\nR M\u03c7R ,\nMKmn =\n\nZ\n\n\u2212\u03c0R\n\u03c0R\n\n\u03c0R\n\nn\ndy \u03c7m\nR \u2202y \u03c7L ,\n\nMLmn =\n\n\u2212\u03c0R\n\nZ\n\nn\ndy \u03c7m\nL M\u03c7L .\n\n(5)\n\n\u2212\u03c0R\n\nIt is noted that MKmn becomes proportional to \u03b4mn when \u03c7nR,L are the eigenfunctions\nof bulk equations of motion, and MRmn , MLmn are also proportional to \u03b4mn for a\nconstant (y-independent) mass parameter M due to the normalization conditions.\n\n2.1\n\nSeesaw and Electroweak Lagrangian\n\nWe further implement the seesaw operation assuming O(mn ) \u226a O(MR,L,K ) and find\nthe induced Majorana mass matrix for three-generations light neutrinos\nM\u03bd = \u2212MDt MN\u22121 MD .\n3\n\n(6)\n\n\fIt is useful for later discussions to write down the electroweak Lagrangian in the basis\nwhere all the mass matrices are generation-diagonalized.

The spinors \u03bdd are three light neutrinos for which the seesawinduced mass matrix (6) is diagonalized\nM\u03bd = U\u03bd\u2217 M\u03bdd U\u03bd\u2020 ,\n\nU\u03bd \u03bdd = \u03bd \u2212 MD\u2020 MN\u22121 \u2217 N,\n\n(8)\n\nand Nd denote the infinite numbers of neutrino KK modes for which the bulk mass\nmatrix MN is diagonalized both in the generation and KK-mode spaces by a unitary\nmatrix UN :\nMN = UN\u2217 MNd UN\u2020 ,\n\nUN Nd = N + MN\u22121 MD \u03bd.\n\n(9)\n\nThe lepton mixing matrix measured in neutrino oscillation experiments is given\nby UMNS = Ue\u2020 U\u03bd where Ue is the left-handed rotation matrix for diagonalizing the\ncharged-lepton Dirac masses. It is interesting to find in (7) that the model-dependent\nparts of electroweak gauge vertices are governed by a single matrix V defined as\nV = U\u03bd\u2020 MD\u2020 MN\u22121 \u2217 UN .\n\n(10)\n\nWhen one works in the basis where the charged-lepton sector is flavor diagonal, U\u03bd\nis fixed by the neutrino oscillation matrix.\nThe neutrinos also have the Yukawa couplings to the Higgs doublet H in the\nfour-dimensional boundary, from which the Dirac mass (2) is generated;\nLh = f H\u0303 \u2020 N PL L \u03b4(y) + h.c.,\n\n(11)\n\nwhere H\u0303 = \u01ebH \u2217 . The doublet Higgs H has a non-vanishing expectation value v and\nits fluctuation h(x) in the lower component. After integrating out the fifth dimension\nand diagonalizing mass matrices, we have the Yukawa interaction\nhX n\nLh =\n\u03a8 mn PL U\u03bd (\u03bdd + V Nd ) + h.c.,\nv n R\nand \u03a8nR are determined by the mass eigenstates through Eqs. (8) and (9).\n4\n\n(12)\n\n\f2.2\n\nObservable Seesaw\n\nThe interactions between heavy neutrinos and SM fields are described by the mixing\nmatrix V both in the gauge and Higgs vertices. The 3 \u00d7 \u221e matrix V is determined\n\nby the mass parameters of neutrinos in the original Lagrangian L + Lm . The matrix\n\nelements in V have the experimental upper bounds from electroweak physics. Another important constraint on V comes from the low-energy neutrino experiments,\nnamely, the seesaw-induced mass should be on the order of eV scale, which in turn\nspecifies the scale of heavy neutrino mass MN . This can be seen from the definition\nof V by rewriting it with the light and heavy neutrino mass eigenvalues\n1\n\n1\n\nV = i(M\u03bdd ) 2 X(MNd )\u2212 2 ,\n\n(13)\n\nwhere X is an arbitrary 3 \u00d7 \u221e matrix with XX t = 1. Therefore one naively expects that, with a fixed order of M\u03bdd \u223c 10\u22121 eV and |V | & 10\u22122 for the discovery\n\nof experimental signature of heavy neutrinos, their masses should be very light and\nsatisfy MNd . keV (this does not necessarily mean that the seesaw operation is not\njustified as M\u03bdd is fixed). The previous collider studies of TeV-scale right-handed\nneutrinos [8] did not satisfy the seesaw relation (13) and have to rely on some assumption for suppressing the necessarily-induced (large) mass M\u03bd ; for example, the\nneutrino mass matrix must have a singular generation structure, otherwise it leads\nto the decoupling of heavy neutrinos from collider physics.\nA possible scenario for observable heavy neutrinos is to take a specific value of\nbulk Majorana mass [4] so that the lepton number is recovered in low-energy effective\ntheory. In this paper we assume that bulk Dirac mass vanishes, but it is easy to\ninclude it by attaching wavefunction factors in the following formulas. The equations\nof motion without bulk Dirac mass are solved by simple one-dimensional oscillators,\nand the neutrino mass matrices are found\nm\nmn = \u221a\n,\nMRmn = M\u03b4mn ,\n2\u03b4n0 \u03c0R\nn\nMKmn =\n(14)\n\u03b4mn ,\nMLmn = M\u03b4mn .\nR\nFrom these matrices, we find the seesaw-induced mass matrix M\u03bd and the light\nneutrino mixing with heavy modes as follows:\n1\nM\u03bd = mt\nm,\n2 tan(\u03c0R|M|)\n\"\nX\n1\n1\n\u2020\nm\n\u03bd = U\u03bd \u03bdd + \u221a\n|M| +\n2\u03c0R\nn=0\n5\n\n(15)\n2n+1\nn Nd\nR\n\n+\n\nX\nn=1\n\ni\n|M| \u2212\n\n2n\nn Nd\nR\n\n#\n\n.\n\n(16)\n\n\fThe heavy mass eigenstate Nd2n (Nd2n+1 ) are the Majorana fermions with masses\nn\nR\n\n\u2212 |M| ( Rn + |M|). In the seesaw formula, the effect of infinitely many numbers\n\nof KK neutrinos appears as the factor \u03c0R|M|/ tan(\u03c0R|M|). An interesting case is\nthat |M| takes a specific value |M| \u2243 \u03b1/R where \u03b1 is some half integer [5]: the\n\nseesaw-induced mass M\u03bd becomes tiny as a result of KK-mode summation (not\n\nonly suppressed by the Majorana mass scale). On the other hand, the heavy-mode\ninteraction is not suppressed unlike the above naive speculation. These facts realize\nthe situation that right-handed neutrinos in the seesaw mechanism are observable\nat sizable rates in future collider experiments such as the LHC and ILC.\nIn the KK-mode picture, the mass spectrum is vector-like with a half integer \u03b1\nand no chiral zero mode exists; for \u03b1 = 1/2, the mass eigenstates Nd compose the\nDirac fermions Nn (n = 1, 2, * * * ) with masses Mn ,\n1\nNn = \u221a (Nd2n \u2212 iNd2n\u22121 ),\n2\n\nMn =\n\n2n \u2212 1\n.\n2R\n\n(17)\n\nAs a result, the lepton number is preserved in the KK-mode sector and their contributions to the seesaw-induced mass vanish. The model given above is an illustrative\nexample for accessible seesaw neutrinos. While there are many other possibilities for\nextra-dimensional seesaw, they are supposed to have a common mass matrix structure as a key ingredient for tiny neutrino masses and observability, which could be\nseen from the operator analysis in low-energy effective theory. It would therefore\nbe reasonable that the above model is used as a representative of extra-dimensional\nneutrinos. With the use of Eq. (16), the weak interaction of KK Dirac fermions,\nwhich is relevant to the collider study, turns out to be\nLint\n\nHere \u03b4M \u2261\n\n1\n2R\n\n\u0012\n\u00131\ng X 1\n2M\u03bdd 2\n\u2020\n\u03bc\nPL Nn\n= \u2212\u221a\nW\u03bc \u0113\u03b3 UMNS\n\u03b4M\n2 n=1 \u03c0RMn\n\u0012\n\u00131\nd 2\nX 1\ng\n\u03bc 2M\u03bd\n\u2212\nPL Nn\nZ\u03bc \u03bd\u0304d \u03b3\n2 cos \u03b8W n=1 \u03c0RMn\n\u03b4M\n\u00131\n\u0012\nX 1\n2M\u03bdd 2\n\u2212\nPR Nn + h.c. .\nh\u03bd\u0304d\n\u03c0Rv\n\u03b4\nM\nn=1\n\n(18)\n\n\u2212 |M| characterizes the scale of small neutrino masses.\n\nSimilarly to the seesaw neutrino mass, heavy neutrinos do not give sizable con-\n\ntributions to lepton-number-violating processes such as the like-sign di-leptons in\nthe final states [9].

The new study [14] may be given the stronger constraints.The\nchange of the constraints can be put in the change of \u03b4M bound.It is straightforward to extend them to larger values because collider signals such as the production\ncross sections of heavy KK neutrinos are simply proportional to 1/\u03b4M , though the\ndiscovery of the signal will be difficult.\nThe compactification radius R is not relevant to the constraint from the operator\nO(6) . It is however limited by the LEP experiment since the Dirac masses of KK\n\nneutrinos are given by Mn = (2n \u2212 1)/2R. It is easy to confirm that the constraint\n\nis not so severe if 1/R > 200 GeV, and we thus use the value\n1/R = 300 GeV,\n\n(25)\n\nas a representative point of 1/R in our simulation study.\n\n3.3\n\nSimulation Tools\n\nThe signal and SM events have been generated by Physsim [15]. The initial-state\nradiation and bremsstrahlung have been included in the event generations. The\nbeam energy spread was set to be 0.14% for electron and 0.07% for positron beams.\nThe finite crossing angle between the electron and positron beams was assumed to\nbe 14 mrad.

The phase space integration and the\ngeneration of parton 4-momenta have been performed by a nubmerical integration\nprogram package , BASES/SPRING [17]. The parton showering and hadronization\nhave been carried out by using the event generator PYTHIA6.4 [18], where final-state\ntau leptons are decayed by the MC particle decay software package, TAUOLA [19]\nto handle their polarizations correctly.\nThe generated Monte Carlo events have been passed to a detector simulator called\nJSFQuickSimulator, which implements the geometry and other detector-performance\nrelated parameters of an ILC detector concept called GLD [20]. In the detector simulator, hits by charged particles at the vertex detector and track parameters at the\ncentral tracker are smeared according to their position resolutions, taking into account correlations due to off-diagonal elements in the error matrix. Since calorimeter\nsignals are simulated in individual segments, a realistic simulation of cluster overlapping is possible. Track-cluster matching is performed for the hit clusters in the\ncalorimeter in order to form pseudo Particle Flow Objects (pPFO), thereby achieving\nthe best attainable jet energy measurements. The resultant detector performance in\nour simulation study is summarized in Table 3.\n\n4\n\nResults from Simulation Study\n\n\u221a\nThe simulation has been performed at s = 500 GeV for the first KK mode of\n\u221a\nright-handed neutrinos, and at s = 1 TeV for the KK modes up to the third level,\nwith an integrated luminosity of 500 fb\u22121 each. We have considered the case with no\nbeam polarization.

In the analysis, we have used the hadronicdecay modes of W , which allow us to fully reconstruct the mass of N1 .\n4.1.1\n\nAnalysis of \u03bdN1 \u2192 \u03bdeW\n\nIn the signal event, an isolated-electron track from the decay of N1 is expected. We\nhave therefore selected the electron track and reconstructed two jets in the final state\nof the signal. Since the isolated-electron track has no energy around it, while a track\nfrom a jet has some energy, we have selected tracks with the energy around them\nwithin 20 degrees below 5 GeV. Then, in the tracks which satisfy the requirement,\nthe track with the maximum energy has been selected as a candidate of the electron\ntrack. After picking up the isolated-electron track, the clustering of the jets has been\nperformed. The pPFOs have been combined to form a jet if the two clusters satisfy\nyij < ycut , where the variable yij is defined as\nyij =\n\n2Ei Ej (1 \u2212 cos \u03b8ij )\n.\n2\nEvis\n\n(26)\n\nHere, \u03b8ij is the angle between two clusters, Ei(j) are their energies, and Evis is the\ntotal visible energy. All events are forced to have two jets by adjusting ycut . The\nmass of N1 was, then, reconstructed using the candidate for the electron track and\ntwo reconstructed jets.\n11\n\n\f16000\n\n\u03bdN1\n\n\u03bdeW\n\ne\u03bdW\nWW\nZZ\ntt\n\n14000\n12000\n10000\n8000\n6000\n4000\n2000\n0\n130\n\n135\n\n140\n\n145\n\n150\n\n155\n\n160\n\n165\n\n170\n\nN1 mass (GeV)\n\nFigure 2: Distribution of the N1 mass reconstructed from Mejj in the case of inverted\nneutrino mass hierarchy at\n\n\u221a\n\ns = 500 GeV.\n\nWe have considered the processes shown in Table 5 as the background. In order\nto suppress these background processes, we have applied the following requirement.\nThe isolated electron candidate selected above would have a higher energy then\ntracks from jets, if it were really coming from the decay of N1 . We, hence, required\nthe energy of the isolated-electron candidate (Ee ) to be 10 GeV < Ee < 200 GeV.\nIn addition, since the reconstructed di-jet mass (Mjj ) should be consistent with the\nW hypothesis for a signal event, we have selected events with 60 GeV < Mjj <\n100 GeV. For reconstruction of the N1 mass with the isolated electron and W\ncandidates (Mejj ), the energy and momentum of the W candidate was corrected to\nhave W mass. Figure 2 shows the distribution of Mejj after all the selection cuts in\nthe case of the inverted neutrino mass hierarchy. With the signal region defined by\n135 GeV < Mejj < 165 GeV, the numbers of signal and background events before\nand after selection cuts are summarized in Table 5.\nWe have evaluated the measurement accuracy of the N1 mass and its production\ncross section by fitting the Mejj distribution. The N1 mass values and errors from\nthe fit are 150.2 \u00b1 0.20 GeV, 150.0 \u00b1 0.01 GeV, and 150.0 \u00b1 0.01 GeV, for the\n\nnormal, inverted, and degenerate neutrino mass hierarchies, respectively. These\n\nresults correspond to the measurement accuracies of 0.14%, 0.01%, and 0.01%. On\nthe other hand, the cross section of e+ e\u2212 \u2192 \u03bdN1 (N1 \u2192 eW ) events turned out to\n\nbe measurable with accuracies of 6.5%, 0.4%, and 0.4%. Since the cross-section of\nthe normal hierarchy is much smaller than that of the other hierarchies as shown in\nTable 4, the measurement accuracy for the normal hierarchy is worse. The results\n\n12\n\n\fare summarized in Table 7.\n4.1.2\n\nAnalysis of \u03bdN1 \u2192 \u03bd\u03c4 W\n\nIn order to analyze e+ e\u2212 \u2192 \u03bdN1 (N1 \u2192 \u03c4 W ) events, we have reconstructed all events\n\nas 3-jet. A jet with the smallest number of the tracks was assumed to be a tau-jet.\nThe previous signal e+ e\u2212 \u2192 \u03bdN1 (N1 \u2192 eW ) has been considered as background\n\ntogether with e+ e\u2212 \u2192 e\u03bdW and W W shown in Table 5. The following selection cuts\n\nhave been applied to reduce these backgrounds. The energy of the tau-jet (E\u03c4 ) was\nrequired to satisfy 10 GeV < E\u03c4 < 150 GeV in order to reject high energy electron-\n\nand muon-tracks from the leptonic-decay modes of W in the e+ e\u2212 \u2192 W W events.\n\nWe required the same criteria for the di-jet mass, Mjj , as in the study of \u03bdN \u2192 eW .\n\nThen, the reconstructed N1 mass (M\u03c4 jj ) was required to be 80 GeV < M\u03c4 jj < 160\nGeV.\nAfter applying the selection cuts, a likelihood analysis has been performed. Since\nthe processes e+ e\u2212 \u2192 e\u03bdW , \u03bdN1 (N1 \u2192 eW ) dominate in the background, we\n\nconstructed two likelihood functions to separate the signal from e\u03bdW (Le\u03bdW ) and\n\u03bdN1 \u2192 \u03bdeq q\u0304 (L\u03bdN1 \u2192\u03bdeqq\u0304 ). As the input variables of the likelihood functions, we used\n\nthe number of tracks in the jets of the tau candidate, the energy of the track with\nthe maximum energy in the tau-jet (Emax ), and the energy of tau-jet with Emax\n\nsubtracted from it. These likelihood functions were prepared for the normal and\ninverted neutrino mass hierarchies separately, because we would be able to identify\nthe neutrino mass hierarchies by using the cross section of \u03bdN \u2192 \u03bdeW events.\n\nWe have required Le\u03bdW > 0.79 (0.63) and L\u03bdN1 \u2192\u03bdeqq\u0304 > 0.13 (0.11) for the normal\n\n(inverted) neutrino mass hierarchy to maximize the signal significance.\n\nThe resolution of the N1 mass can be improved by compensating for the missing\nenergy of the \u03c4 decay as follows: Since the N1 mass has already been measured\nthrough the analysis of \u03bdN \u2192 \u03bdeW events, we can calculate energy of the N1\n\nassuming its two-body kinematics. Then, we calculated the energy of the tau as the\ncalculated N1 energy minus the energy of the W candidate. We assumed that the\ndirection of the tau coincided the direction of the tau-jet. The corrected mass of N1\n(col M\u03c4 jj ) was reconstructed by using the estimated tau energy and momentum and\n\nthose of the W candidate. Figure 3 shows the distribution of col M\u03c4 jj for the inverted\nneutrino mass hierarchy after applying all selection cuts. The number of events in\nthe signal region, 135 GeV <col M\u03c4 jj < 165 GeV, before and after the selection cuts\nare summarized in Table 5.

Taking into account\nthe cross sections shown in Table 4, we have studied the process e+ e\u2212 \u2192 \u03bdN1\n\n(N1 \u2192 \u03bdeW ) for all the neutrino mass hierarchies and e+ e\u2212 \u2192 \u03bdN2,3 (N2,3 \u2192 \u03bdeW )\nprocesses for the inverted and degenerate neutrino mass hierarchies. The background\nprocesses considered in this study are shown in Table 6.\nAfter the selection of the electron track and the reconstruction of two jets with\n\u221a\nthe same procedure as the study at s = 500 GeV, the following selection cuts were\napplied. To remove electron tracks from jets, we selected high-energy electrons by\nrequiring 10 GeV < Ee < 600 GeV. The di-jet mass was required to satisfy the same\n\u221a\ncriteria as the study at s = 500 GeV. Since the W W events have a peak at 500\nGeV for the di-jet energy distribution, we have required the di-jet energy should be\nbelow 460 GeV. Shifting the energy and momentum of the W candidate to have\nthe nominal W mass, the Mejj was calculated. Finally, the signal region has been\ndefined as 135 GeV < Mejj < 165 GeV, 425 GeV < Mejj < 475 GeV, and 720 GeV\n14\n\n\f2400\n2200\n\n1200\n\n(a)\n\n\u03bdN2\ne\u03bdW\nWW\nZZ\ntt\n\n2000\n1800\n1600\n\n(b)\n\n\u03bdeW\n\n\u03bdN3\ne\u03bdW\nWW\nZZ\ntt\n\n1000\n\n800\n\n\u03bdeW\n\n1400\n\n600\n\n1200\n1000\n\n400\n\n800\n600\n\n200\n\n400\n\n0\n410 420\n\n430 440 450 460 470\n\n0\n680\n\n480 490 500\n\nEntries\n\nEntries\n\n200\n\n700\n\n720\n\nN2 mass (GeV)\n\n740\n\n760\n\n780\n\n800\n\n820\n\nN3 mass (GeV)\n\nFigure 4: Distributions of the masses of (a) the second and (b) third KK modes reconstructed from Mejj in the case of inverted neutrino mass hierarchy at\n\n\u221a\ns = 1 TeV.\n\n< Mejj < 780 GeV for the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd KK modes, respectively.

The masses of right-handed neutrinos\ncould be determined with the accuracy better than 1%.\n\n5\n\nDiscussion\n\nWe found that the observation of the higher KK modes, especially the mass spectrum\nof these particles is measured accurately at the ILC, which allows us to confirm that\nphysics behind these signals is based on higher-dimensional theory. The observation\nof the masses of KK modes, however, does not directly mean that the signals are\ncoming from physics responsible for neutrino masses and mixings, because there are\nmany scenarios in the framework of higher-dimensional theory which are not related\nto neutrinos but to other issues such as hierarchy problem and dark matter.\nIn order to confirm that the signals are from physics of neutrino masses and mixings through the higher-dimensional theory, we should observe not only the masses\nof KK modes but also other quantities which depend strongly on parameters of\nneutrinos. One of such parameters is \u03b4M , because it is the origin of tiny neutrino\nmasses. However, the smallness of the parameter inevitably leads to the smallness of\n15\n\n\f\u221a\nProcess ( s = 500 GeV)\n\u03bdN1 \u2192 \u03bdeW (W \u2192 q q\u0304)\n\nCross sec.\n\nEvents No.\n\nEvents after cuts\n\n(N)\n\n6.5 [fb]\n\n3,262\n\n2,216\n\n(I)\n\n297.5 [fb]\n\n177,700\n\n101,057\n\n(D)\n\n257.1 [fb]\n\n128,564\n\n87,588\n\n4,462 [fb]\n\n2,231,000\n\n22,594\n\n1320 [fb]\n\n660,000\n\n11,324\n\n108 [fb]\n\n54,000\n\n1\n\n531 [fb]\n\n265,500\n\n568\n\nCross sec.\n\nEvents\n\nEvents after cuts\n\n(N)\n\n5.49 [fb]\n\n2,745\n\n1,029\n\n(I)\n\n4.18 [fb]\n\n2,090\n\n821\n\n6.52 [fb]\n\n3,260\n\n495 (N)\n\n554 (I)\n\n4,460 [fb]\n\n223,100\n\n8,989 (N)\n\n12,276 (I)\n\n1,980,000 13,788 (N)\n\n14,861 (I)\n\ne\u03bdW \u2192 e\u03bdq q\u0304\n\nW W \u2192 l\u03bdq q\u0304\n\nZZ \u2192 \u03bd\u03bdq q\u0304, llq q\u0304\ntt\u0304\n\n\u221a\nProcess ( s = 500 GeV)\n\u03bdN1 \u2192 \u03bd\u03c4 W (W \u2192 q q\u0304)\n\u03bdN1 \u2192 \u03bdeW (W \u2192 q q\u0304)\ne\u03bdW \u2192 e\u03bdq q\u0304\n\nW W \u2192 l\u03bdq q\u0304\n\n3,960 [fb]\n\nTable 5: Summary of cuts for\n\n\u221a\n\ns = 500 GeV.\n\nlepton-number violation in the scenario, so that it is difficult to observe the quantities\nrelated to this parameter through processes violating the lepton-number.\nAnother interesting parameter is UMNS describing phenomena of neutrino mixings. The higher-dimensional theory for neutrinos considered in this article predicts\na specific flavor-structure at the right-handed neutrino sector, and it is completely\ndetermined by the mixing parameter UMNS and neutrino masses M\u03bdd as shown in\nEq. (18). This fact leads to that branching fractions of the right-handed neutrino\nare governed by UMNS and M\u03bdd . We have shown that both the eW and \u03c4 W decay modes of N1 can fortunately be measured at the ILC.

The ILC\n\nhas, therefore, a potential not only to discover the signal of higher-dimension theory\nbut also to observe the signal related to neutrino oscillation parameters.\n\n6\n\nSummary\n\nWe have investigated ILC signals of the seesaw scenario in a five-dimensional extension of the SM, where right-handed neutrinos live in the bulk and the SM particles\nstay at a four-dimensional boundary. We focused on the production process of KK\nright-handed neutrinos, e+ e\u2212 \u2192 N\u03bd (N \u2192 lW , W \u2192 q q\u0304), where the masses of\nKK right-handed neutrinos N can be fully reconstructed. With realistic Monte-\n\nCarlo simulations, we found that the masses of KK neutrinos and their production\ncross sections can be measured accurately at the ILC as summarized in Table 7. In\nparticular, it was found that the mass and production cross section of the first KK\nright-handed neutrino can be measured accurately for various hierarchies of neutrino\nmasses with the center of mass energy of 500 GeV. In addition, it was shown that\nmasses and production cross sections of the second and third KK neutrinos can be\nmeasured with the center of mass energy of 1 TeV.\nThe ILC also allow us to investigate the flavor structure of the higher-dimensional\ntheory using the measurement of the N1 production cross section followed by its\nvarious decay modes. Since branching fractions of N1 decay modes are determined by\nthe masses of neutrinos and their mixing matrix UMNS , measuring the ratio between\nthese fractions can be directly compared with the results of neutrino oscillation\nexperiments, which give us an important clue to clarify the mechanism to generate\nneutrino masses in the framework of the higher dimensional theory. Interestingly,\nthe first or third generation lepton in the final state of the N1 decay can be detected\nat the ILC, while the LHC will be possible to observe that with the first or second\nlepton. The ILC will therefore be a complementary machine to the LHC to explore\nphysics of neutrinos in the higher-dimensional theory.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\n19\n\n\fThe authors would like to thank all the members of the ILC physics subgroup\n[21] for useful discussions.
