The low temperature thermodynamics of the impurity are deduced from the leading\ncorrections to the low energy fixed point of the renormalization group transformation. An alternative approach to\nthe calculation of the low energy behaviour is the renormalized perturbation theory (RPT) [3]. When this approach is applied to the Anderson impurity model, for\ninstance, the effective low energy model generated is just\na renormalized version of the Anderson model; expressions for the renormalized parameters can be derived in\nterms of the self-energy, its derivative and the irreducible\nfour-vertex, all evaluated at zero frequency [3,4]. In this\npaper we will clarify the relation between these two approaches, and consider the various possible ways of determining the renormalized parameters. We will also generalize the approach to include models which have a coupling\nto phonons and a Falikov-Kimball screening interaction\nbetween the impurity and conduction electrons.\nThe Anderson model [5] has the form,\nX\nX\nHAM =\n\u01ebd d\u2020\u03c3 d\u03c3 + U nd,\u2191 nd,\u2193 +\n\u01ebk,\u03c3 c\u2020k,\u03c3 ck,\u03c3 +\n\u03c3\n\n+\n\nk,\u03c3\n\nX\n\n(Vk d\u2020\u03c3 ck,\u03c3 + Vk\u2217 c\u2020k,\u03c3 d\u03c3 ).\n\nmatrix element Vk . There is in addition a local interaction\nU between the electrons on the impurity site. When U = 0\nthe local level broadens into a resonance, corresponding\nto a localized quasi-bound\nP state, whose width depends on\nthe quantity \u2206(\u03c9) = \u03c0 k |Vk |2 \u03b4(\u03c9 \u2212 \u01ebk ). It is usual to\nconsider the case of a wide conduction band with a flat\ndensity of states where \u2206(\u03c9) becomes independent of \u03c9\nand can be taken as a constant \u2206.\nIn the renormalized model used in the RPT approach\nthere is an effective energy level at \u01eb\u0303d , and an effective\n \u0303 Expressions for these renormalized\nresonance width \u2206.\nparameters can be derived in terms of the 'bare' parameters, \u01ebd , \u2206, the local self-energy \u03a3\u03c3 (\u03c9, h) and its frequency\nderivative \u03a3\u03c3\u2032 (\u03c9, h) evaluated at zero frequency \u03c9 = 0,\nzero magnetic field h = 0, and T = 0.

The discretization of the conduction band is logarithmic and such\nthat the density of levels increases as the Fermi-level is\napproached, and \u01eb = 0 is the limit point of the sequence.\nWith the model in this form an iterative diagonalization\nscheme is then set up, starting with the impurity site, and\nan extra site along the chain is added at each iteration\nstep. After five or six steps the matrices become too large\nto handle, and after this point the Hibert space is truncated, with the higher energy states being neglected. A\nfixed number, of the order 500-1500 of the lowest lying\nenergy states, is retained at each subsequent step. The\ncouplings along the chain fall off as \u039b\u2212n/2 , where n is\nthe nth site as \u039b > 1. Lower and lower energy scales are\nreached in the process but the Hamiltonian is rescaled after each step by a factor \u039b1/2 , so that the lowest energy\nscale is formally the same after each iteration.\nA renormalization group transformation can be set up\nin which the states and couplings can be compared after\neach step. This renormalization group transformation for\nthe s-d (Kondo) and Anderson model has a low energy\nfixed point corresponding to states of a free chain uncoupled from the impurity. In the s-d case this was interpreted\nas a J \u2192 \u221e fixed point, so that the impurity and first site\nbecome essentially uncoupled from the chain. As this fixed\npoint Hamiltonian corresponds to a free chain it gives no\nfinite contribution to the impurity susceptibility and specific heat. The finite impurity susceptibility and specific\nheat arise from the leading irrelevant terms of the renormalization group transformation, which correspond to a\nresidual interaction and a one-body coupling term at the\nend of this decoupled chain.\nSimilar results hold for the Anderson model [2] which\nfor the symmetric model can be interpreted as a V \u2192 \u221e\nfixed point. However, from the Bethe ansatz exact solution\nof the Anderson model [12,13] we know that the Anderson model behaves as a Fermi-liquid, whatever the value\nof the interaction term, so the nature of the fixed point\nis independent of U . It seems appropriate from a Fermiliquid point of view, therefore, to base the interpretation\nof the low energy fixed point on the original chain including the impurity, but with renormalized parameters. In\nthis approach the fixed point and leading irrelevant terms\nare those of the renormalized Anderson model; this then\nmakes a direct connection with the effective model used\nin the renormalized perturbation theory. It also has the\nadvantage that it can be interpreted in terms of a quasiparticle picture in 1-1 comparison with the original model.\nWe can use the NRG technique to calculate the renormalized Fermi-liquid parameters. A knowledge of how these\nrenormalized parameters, such as the quasiparticle interaction \u0168 , depend on the bare parameters of the model can\ngive us considerable insight into the low energy behaviour\nof impurity systems. The numerical results for the physical\nbehaviour of the model at low temperatures, the susceptibilities, specific heat coefficient etc, are essentially the\nsame as those obtained in the earlier NRG calculations of\nKWW [2]; the difference here is that they are interpreted\nin terms of a single renormalized model, with parameters\n\n3\n\nin 1-1 correspondence with those of the original Anderson model, and the calculational procedure has also been\nconsiderably simplified. The approach can be extended to\nmore general impurity models including orbital degeneracy [14].\nIn the next section of this paper we give a new way\nof analysing the fixed point to determine the renormalized parameters, which is straight forwardly applicable to\nsystems with a non-symmetric and non-constant density\nof states. The approach is then applied to generalizations\nof the model to include an interaction with phonons, and\nFalikov-Kimball terms, for which there are in general no\nexact results. We examine how the quasiparticle interaction and renormalized parameters vary according to the\nparameter regimes of these more general impurity models.\nIn the conclusion we discuss the question of the extent to\nwhich these additional interactions, such as those due to\nphonons and the Falikov-Kimball terms, may be absorbed\nby modifying the parameters of the bare model, or whether\nto describe fully the behaviour in higher energy regimes,\nthese terms have to be included explicitly.\n\n2 Calculation of Renormalized Parameters\nIn this section we will examine the low energy NRG fixed\npoint of the Anderson model as a renormalized version of\nthe same model and deduce the renormalized parameters\n \u0303 and \u0168 . The starting point of the NRG calculation is\n\u01eb\u0303d , \u2206\nthe discretized form of the model given in equation (11).\nThe many-body states are calculated using the iteration\nprocedure as outlined in the previous section. For a given\nN , we denote the minimum energy required to add a single electron to the ground state by Ep (N ), and and the\nminimum energy to create a single hole by Eh (N ). If these\nsingle particle and hole excitations correspond to a renormalized Anderson model, then asymptotically they should\ncoincide with those of the free model with an appropriate\nchoice of \u01eb\u0303d and \u2206 \u0303 (the term in \u0168 plays a role only when\nmore than one single particle excitation is created from\nthe ground state).

We start first of all\nwith the value \u01ebd = \u2212\u03c0\u2206 = constant, and then increase U\nfrom U = 0 to U = 2.7\u03c0\u2206. This takes us from what might\nbe called the full orbital regime to the Kondo regime. The\nresults are plotted in figure 4. We see that \u01eb\u0303d increases at\nfirst approximately linearly with U until U/\u03c0\u2206 \u223c 1, and\nthen slowly increases monotonically through zero at the\n\n\fA.C.Hewson et al.: Renormalized Parameters for Impurity Models\n\n7\n\n2\n\nR\n\nnimp\n\n1\n\n1\n\n2\n\n1.5\n\n0\n\n~\n\u2206/\u2206\n\n1\n\n0.5\n\n-1\n\nU/\u03c0\u2206\n0\n\n~\nU/\u03c0\u2206\n\n0\n\n\u03b5d/\u03c0\u2206\n\n-2\n\n-0.5\n\n~\n\u03b5d/\u03c0\u2206\n\n-3\n\n-1\n\n-1\n\n-1.5\n-2\n\n-0.5\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\nU/\u03c0\u2206\n\n \u0303\nFig. 4.

Over the same parameter\nrange nimp decreases from an initial value of 1.8 to slightly\nbelow unity at U = 2.7\u03c0\u2206. The Wilson ratio or \u03c7/\u03b3 ratio, R = 1 + \u0168 \u03c1\u0303d (0), increases from 1 and asymptotically\napproaches 2 in the Kondo regime. For negative values of\n \u0303\nU , \u01eb\u0303d and \u0168 decrease linearly as U decreases and \u2206/\u2206\napproaches unity. In full orbital regime U/\u03c0\u2206 < 0.5, including the range with larger negative values of U , the\nHartree-Fock theory, where \u01eb\u0303d = \u01ebd + U nd /2 and \u2206 \u0303 = \u2206,\nconstitutes a reasonably good approximation.\nIt is interesting to compare this behaviour with that\nfor the spectral density \u03c1d (\u03c9) of the d-electron Green's\nfunction, which can be calculated from the NRG results.\nSome of the results for \u03c1d (\u03c9) over the same parameter\nrange are shown in figure 5(i). Initially there is only a\nsingle resonance which moves to higher energies as U is\nincreased. As the Kondo regime is approached this splits\ninto a three peaked structure, the central narrow peak at\nthe Fermi-level being the many-body Kondo resonance.\nThe renormalized Anderson model given by equation (4)\ndescribes only a single resonance, but is valid for the low\nenergy behaviour in all the parameter regimes. We see that\nfor smaller values of U , and in the negative U regime, \u01eb\u0303d\ntracks at first the lower resonance, increasing monotonically, and in the Kondo regime tracks the Kondo resonance.

The\nvalues of U for the curves in (i) can be read off from the left\nhand scale from the coordinates of the corresponding maxima,\nand those for \u01ebd in (ii) from the right hand scale.\n\nin figure 5(i) where the curve for \u01eb\u0303d taken from figure 4 is\nplotted with the spectral density results, where the main\npeak for each \u03c1d (\u03c9) has been normalized to unity for the\ncomparison; the maxima of these peaks all lie on the curve.\nThe height of the atomic-like peaks in this plot, which appear at \u03c9 \u223c \u01ebd and \u03c9 \u223c \u01ebd + U for larger U in the Kondo\nregime, become somewhat flattened in the normalization\nas the Kondo peak is so high, making them difficult to see\nclearly in figure 5.\nIn figure 6 we give the renormalized parameters for a\ncomplementary scan. In this case we start first of all with\n\u01ebd = \u22123\u03c0\u2206 and U = 2\u03c0\u2206, which is in the almost full\norbital regime as \u01ebd + U < 0, and then increase \u01ebd with a\nfixed value for U to a final value \u01ebd = 1.5\u03c0\u2206. In doing so\nwe move to a mixed valence regime for \u01ebd + U \u223c 0, then\nfor \u01ebd = \u2212\u03c0\u2206 the Kondo regime for the symmetric model\nwith U/\u03c0\u2206 = 2, another mixed valence regime for \u01ebd \u223c 0,\nand finally an empty orbital regime for \u01ebd > \u03c0\u2206. In the\nearlier renormalization group analysis of KWW [2], these\nparameter regimes are interpreted in terms of essentially\nthree different fixed points, (i) the full (empty) orbital (ii)\nthe strong coupling and (iii) the mixed valent. In the analysis here, however, they are simply different parameter\nregimes of a single renormalized Anderson model. We see\nfrom figure 6 the characteristic features of full and empty\norbital regimes, \u01eb\u0303d increases linearly with \u01ebd , the Wilson\nratio R \u223c 1, nimp \u223c 2 or 0, and \u2206 \u0303 and \u0168 are independent\nenergy scales. In contrast in the Kondo regime, \u01eb\u0303d \u2248 0\nand is largely independent of \u01ebd , the Wilson ratio R \u223c 2,\nnimp \u223c 1, and the energy scales \u2206 \u0303 and \u0168 have merged such\n \u0303 The mixed valence regimes appear more as\nthat \u0168 = \u03c0 \u2206.\n\n\f8\n\nA.C.Hewson et al.: Renormalized Parameters for Impurity Models\n\ncross-over regions between these two types of behaviour,\nwhere the independence of the two energy scales \u2206 \u0303 and \u0168\nemerges. The curve for \u01eb\u0303d from figure 6 is plotted in figure\n5(ii) with the corresponding results for the spectral density\n\u03c1d (\u03c9), with the height of the peaks normalized to unity.\nThe renormalized level \u01eb\u0303d is found to track the single peak\nin the full orbital regime as it moves up through the intermediate valence regime \u01ebd + U \u223c 0, where a second lower\npeak develops near \u03c9 \u223c \u01ebd , and then it tracks the central\nnarrow resonance at the Fermi-level in the Kondo regime,\nwhere a third upper peak develops near \u03c9 \u223c \u01ebd + U . The\nreverse process occurs as \u01ebd increases from \u01ebd \u223c \u2212\u03c0\u2206, as\nthe side peaks disappear and a single peak emerges in the\nempty orbital regime. As in figure 5(i) atomic-like side\npeaks at \u03c9 \u223c \u01ebd , and \u03c9 \u223c \u01ebd + U , which appear in the\nmixed valence and Kondo regimes, are only just discernable due to the normalization of the height of the central\nresonance. If we concentrate on the mixed valence regime\nfor \u01ebd \u223c 0 in figure 6, we see that there is a significant\nupward shift of \u01eb\u0303d . This reflects the effective shift in the\nbare level \u01ebd obtained by Haldane [20] in a poor man's\nscaling treatment in which the virtual charge fluctuations\nwere eliminated to focus on the mixed valent regime. For\nthe U = \u221e limit, the thermodynamic behaviour of the\nmodel in this regime was shown by Haldane to depend\non the ratio \u01edd /\u2206, where \u01edd = \u01ebd + \u2206/\u03c0ln(\u03c0D/2\u2206). For\nthe renormalized Anderson model the equivalent ratio is\n \u0303 so \u01edd is not to be equated with \u01eb\u0303d but \u01eb\u0303d /z. In the\n\u01eb\u0303d /\u2206,\nmixed valence regime \u01ebd + U \u223c 0 the Haldane shift can be\nseen to be in the opposite direction, to lower energies.\n\n2\n\nR\n1.5\n\n1\n\n~\nU/\u03c0\u2206\n\nnimp\n\n~\n\u2206/\u2206\n\n0.5\n\n0\n\n\u03b5~d/\u03c0\u2206\n\n-0.5\n\n-1\n-3\n\n-2\n\n-1\n\n\u03b5d/\u03c0\u2206\n\n0\n\n1\n\n \u0303\nFig. 6.

Such a term could\nbe important when dealing with an impurity with a partially filled 4f shell, as there can be a change of the ionic\nvolume of the order of 10% when an electron is removed\nor added to the 4f shell due to the adjustment of electrons in the outer d and s shells. The simplest type of\ninteraction to consider is a coupling of the occupation of\nthe d or f shells to an Einstein phonon of frequency \u03c90 ,\nwhich is of the form used to study polaronic effects in\na tight-binding model by Holstein [23]. If we add such a\nterm to the Hamiltonian for the Anderson model we get\nthe Anderson-Holstein model, which we have studied in\nearlier work [24].

When the original Coulomb interaction term U = 0,\nthe effective interaction is attractive (Ueff < 0), so that in\nthe localized strong coupling regime local bipolarons form,\nwhich is equivalent to the formation of a local moment in\nthe spin model, and there is a Kondo effect in the charge\n(or equivalently isospin) channel.\nFor the large \u03c90 limit, such that we can neglect the\neffect of the exponential terms in the hybridization in the\nHamiltonian (29), we require \u03c90 to be much greater than\nthe conduction bandwidth D [25], which is unrealistic. For\nthe regime \u03c90 \u226a D, the physically appropriate one, the\nexponential terms in the phonon operators in (29) modify\nthe form of the original Anderson model. Nevertheless the\nlow energy fixed point, and the leading irrelevant interaction terms, should correspond to a renormalized Anderson\nmodel. The explicit inclusion of the phonon terms should\nonly be necessary in considering higher order irrelevant\nterms, which contribute only at higher energy scales and\nhigher temperatures. The derivation of the renormalized\nparameters in equation (2) holds provided that the selfenergy \u03a3(\u03c9) is analytic at \u03c9 = 0. We can test this conjecture explicitly by again fitting the lower energy levels\nobtained in the NRG calculations to a renormalized Anderson model with parameters \u01eb\u0303d , \u2206 \u0303 and \u0168 . We first of all\nlook at the results for the particle-hole symmetric model\nwith U = 0, where the phonons induce a negative-U term,\nand assume particle-hole symmetry to compare our results\nwith those obtained in the previous section.

These values\ncover the negative Ueff regime as we have U = 0. We see\nthat, as the coupling g increases, the values of \u2206 \u0303 decrease\nmuch more rapidly in the smaller phonon frequency case\nthan in the large \u03c90 case due to the exponential terms that\nmodify the hybridization in equation (29). The values of \u0168\nare also commensurately smaller because in the localized\n \u0303 which\nor local bipolaron limit, we must have \u0168 = \u2212\u03c0 \u2206,\nis the case for both sets of results in the strong coupling\nlimit.\nIn the results shown in figure 8 we start with a value\nof U/\u03c0\u2206 = 2.35 for which the impurity charge is almost\nlocalized and we are in the Kondo regime: as we increase\ng one effect is to decrease the value of Ueff , and in the\nlarge \u03c90 limit this is the sole effect, so that when Ueff =\n0 we are left with an unrenormalized width parameter\n\u2206 \u0303 = \u2206. In the low \u03c90 case the renormalized interaction \u0168\nchanges sign at the same point as the bare parameter Ueff\nchanges sign. This result is somewhat surprising. As the\neffective interaction induced by the phonons is only valid\non the scale \u03c9 \u226a \u03c90 , one might have expected that the\non-site interaction U would be significantly renormalized\non reducing the energy scale to \u03c9 \u223c \u03c90 , say to \u016a , so\nthat \u0168 would change sign when \u016a = 2g 2 /\u03c90 , which would\nbe significantly shifted from the condition Ueff = 0. This\nis not the case which implies that both the direct and\nphonon induced interaction terms are renormalized in a\nsimilar way.\nAt the point where \u0168 = 0 there are polaronic effects,\n \u0303 is\nwhich are absent in the large \u03c90 limit, such that \u2206\nsignificantly renormalized.

In the model with spins, we can reveal these\npolaronic effects if we choose values of U which cancel the\nattractive interaction that leads to bipolaron formation,\nUeff = U \u2212 2g 2 /\u03c90 = 0. We look at the renormalized resonance width for the symmetric model for a range of values of the electron-phonon coupling g with appropriately\nchosen values of U . As a consequence the renormalized\nquasiparticle interaction \u0168 is negligible. The results for\nthe symmetric model are shown in figure 9 for \u03c90 = 0.05\nand \u03c90 = 0.0125 (D = 1). It can be seen that the decrease\n \u0303 with increase of g is greater in the smaller phonon\nin \u2206\nfrequency case. In the limiting case \u03c90 \u2192 \u221e (2g 2 /\u03c90 fi \u0303\nnite) there is no polaronic effect and \u2206/\u2206\n= 1 in all cases.\nSome insight into the behaviour of the asymmetric model\n(U = 0) with a coupling to phonons can be gained by\ncomparing with the negative-Ueff Anderson model as it\ncorresponds to the case \u03c90 \u2192 \u221e. The asymmetric model\nwith negative-U can be mapped into a positive-U symmetric model with a finite magnetic field H \u223c \u2212\u01ebd under the\ninterchange of charge and spin; the one-electron spectral\ndensity for the isospin up electrons is given by \u03c1d (\u03c9) and\nthat for the isospin down by \u03c1d (\u2212\u03c9). A finite \u01ebd favours\neither the doubly occupied state (isospin up) for \u01ebd < 0, or\nthe empty state for \u01ebd > 0, so that increasing the value of\n|Ueff | has the effect of further increasing the polarization.\nThe results for the renormalized parameters for the asymmetric model with phonons (U = 0 and \u01ebd = \u2212\u03c0\u2206) and finite \u03c90 (= 0.05) which are plotted in figure 10 show a similar trend.

This trend can be\nclearly seen in the calculated values of the spectral density\n\u03c1d (\u03c9) [24], and \u01eb\u0303d tracks the peak in \u03c1d (\u03c9). The peaks in\n\u03c1d (\u03c9) become asymmetric for strong electron-phonon coupling, as phonon side-bands excitations are induced on the\nlow energy side of the peak, giving the appearance of a\nbroadened peak. The peak of the renormalized Anderson\npeak, however, is symmetric with a width \u2206 \u0303 slightly reduced from the bare value \u2206, but is quite compatible with\nthe spectra seen in \u03c1d (\u03c9) for small \u03c9. The renormalized\nmodel has to reproduce the quasiparticle spectrum only\nin the immediate neighbourhood of the Fermi-level which\nin this case lies on the higher energy side of the peak in\n\u03c1d (\u03c9).\n\n4 Model with a Falikov-Kimball Interaction\nApart from the interaction U between the electrons in the\nlocal d- or f-orbitals at the impurity site there will also\nbe a two-body interaction between the electrons in these\norbitals and the conduction electrons. Such a term does\nnot appear in the standard Anderson model but a local\ninteraction of this type is included in the Falikov-Kimball\nmodel [26]. It is the sole two-body interaction term in this\nmodel, which was put forward as an appropriate model for\ninvestigating valence instabilities in compounds, where the\noccupation of the localized f-orbitals changes significantly\nas a result of pressure or alloying (see reference [27] for a\nrecent review). The reason that it is not usually included\nin impurity models, is not because the interaction is very\nsmall, but because it is thought not to play an essential\n\n-4\n\n-3\n\n-2\n\n\u03b5d/\u03c0\u2206\n\n-1\n\n0\n\n \u0303\nFig. 11.

There is a remarkable agreement with these\ndisplaced results over this range.\n\nrole in understanding the impurity behaviour. This means\nthat its effects can, for the most part, be absorbed as a\nrenormalization of terms that are already within the standard models. We can put this hypothesis to the test by\nincluding such a term in the Hamiltonian and then consider what effect it has on the renormalized parameters\nof the low energy fixed point. In the discrete linear chain\nversion of the Anderson model, equation (11), used in the\nNRG calculations such a term can be included as an interaction between the impurity and the electron occupation\nat the first site on the conduction electron chain,\nX\nHFK = Ufk\n(32)\nnd,\u03c3 n0,\u03c3\u2032 ,\n\u03c3,\u03c3\u2032\n\nwhere Ufk denotes the matrix element of the interaction.\nWe add this term to the Hamiltonian in equation (11) and\nthen examine the nature of the low energy fixed point. We\ntake U = 2\u03c0\u2206, as earlier, with Ufk = U/2 = \u03c0\u2206, and take\na range of values of \u01ebd to run from the full orbital, through\nthe Kondo, to the empty orbital regime. We can then compare the results with those obtained from a similar study\nin section 3.\nThe results for the renormalized parameters in this\nstudy are shown in figure 11. The low temperature behaviour of the model, \u03c7s,imp , \u03c7c,imp and \u03b3imp , can be deduced by substituting the renormalized parameters into\nequations (6) and (8). There is a clear correspondence with\nresults derived earlier for the Anderson model without this\nadditional term, shown in figure 6. To examine the correspondence in more detail we have replotted the values\nfrom figure 6 in the same figure, using dotted lines, and\n\n\f12\n\nA.C.Hewson et al.: Renormalized Parameters for Impurity Models\n\nhave displaced the curves by a constant shift of \u03c0\u2206 = Ufk ,\nsuch that the original bare level \u01ebd from figure 6 is replaced\nby an effective bare level \u01edd = \u01ebd + Ufk . The agreement\nbetween the results with the additional Falikov-Kimball\nterm, Ufk = \u03c0\u2206, and those of the model with Ufk = 0\nand an effective bare level \u01edd are quite remarkable. In the\nstrong correlation regime the differences are less than 5%,\nand overall less than 10%. As the nature of the low energy fixed point has not been changed by the inclusion of\nthe Falikov-Kimball term, it is not surprising that the low\nenergy behaviour can still be described by a renormalized\nAnderson model. What is somewhat unexpected in this\ncase is that these renormalized parameters correspond to\na constant shift of the bare level over the whole parameter\nrange, and that no adjustment of the bare hybridization\nterm is required.\nTo examine whether this shift varies or not with U , we\ntake \u01ebd = \u22122\u03c0\u2206 with Ufk = \u03c0\u2206 so that \u01ebd + Ufk = \u2212\u03c0\u2206,\nand vary U over the same range as in the results for the\npure Anderson model shown in figure 4. If the effective\nbare level \u01edd is independent of U the results should coincide with those shown in figure 4. The results of these\ncalculations are shown in figure 12. Again we see that the\nresults are close to those of the Anderson model without\nthis term, with the same shift in the bare \u01ebd . The difference\nin values are less than 4% for U/\u03c0\u2206 > 1, and less than\n12% overall. In these results, and those shown in figure\n11, the differences in the values of nimp are even smaller,\nless than 1%, over the whole parameter range.\nWe conclude that the low temperature behaviour of\nthe model with a Falikov-Kimball interaction Ufk in this\nparameter regime is very similar to that of an Anderson\nmodel without this term, but with a shift of \u01ebd to \u01edd . The\nshift is approximately independent of \u01ebd and U , and linear\nfor Ufk in the range 0 < Ufk /\u03c0\u2206 < 2.0. In this range we\nfound the deviations between the results of the effective\nmodel with \u01edd and the model with the Falikov-Kimball\nterm increase linearly with the value of Ufk .\nIn the case of a vanishing hybridization the nature\nof the fixed point Falikov-Kimball term will be different\nas it will correspond to an X-ray type of problem, with\nthe localized impurity electron corresponding to a corehole, and the self-energy at \u03c9 = 0 will be singular [28].\nThis, however, is a special case, and in general we can\nexpect the self-energy to be regular at \u03c9 = 0 and the\nrenormalized Anderson model to provide the appropriate\nlow energy model (see also the discussion in Sec. V. B of\nreference[27]).\n\n5 Conclusions\nWe have shown that the two renormalization approaches\nto the calculation of the low energy excitations of the Anderson model lead to a consistent picture of the low energy behaviour of the model as described by a renormalized version of the same impurity model. It is interesting\nto make a comparison of this situation with field theoretic\ncalculations for the \u03c64 model or quantum electrodynamics\n(QED).

There is again a close agreement\nwith the results of the model without the additional term but\nwith a displaced \u01ebd .\n\ninfinities arise due to the lack of a high energy cut-off, but\nthe RPT, with the introduction of counter-terms, allows\none to by-pass these infinities and perform calculations\nin terms of a renormalized version of the same model,\nwith particle masses and interactions taken from experiment. The RPT calculations for the Anderson model proceed along similar lines, and the perturbation theory becomes one in terms of the fully dressed quasiparticles and\ntheir interactions, in 1-1 correspondence with the original model. Here, however, the renormalizations, though\nin some situations very large, are not infinite as the conduction band edges provide a high energy cut-off, and the\n \u0303 the analogue of the renorrenormalized parameters, \u01eb\u0303d , \u2206,\nmalized masses can be calculated explicitly from equation\n(2) once the self-energy \u03a3(\u03c9) is known.\nThe Anderson model, as a model for impurity systems,\nneglects many higher energy scale interactions. In including an electron-phonon coupling and a Falikov-Kimball\nterm we have included some of the possible higher energy\ninteraction terms. Explicit calculations have shown that\nthese terms do not change any essential features of the low\nenergy behaviour, which can still be described in terms of\na three-parameter renormalized Anderson model, though\nthe renormalized parameters are modified. It is reasonable to assume that if other types of interaction terms\nare included, such as two-body hybridization terms arising from off-diagonal elements of the Coulomb interaction\nof the impurity d-electron with the conduction electrons,\nthat the same would hold.
