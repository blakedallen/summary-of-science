Introduction\nSoftly broken supersymmetry remains a well motivated and popular playground for\nBeyond the Standard Model practitioners. Calculations of sparticle spectra resulting from\ngiven assumptions about the underlying theory have become increasingly refined, with\nseveral public programs available that incorporate two-loop Renormalisation Group Equations (RGEs) and one-loop radiative corrections. For a recent comparison of the output of\nsome of these programs see the paper by Allanach, Kraml and Porod (AKP) [1]. Two loop\ncorrections are also available to, for example, the effective potential [2]. One area where\nthere has been considerable progress in the last few years is in the calculation of the RGE\n\u03b2-functions. For an arbitrary supersymmetric theory the chiral supermultiplet anomalous\ndimension \u03b3 is known to three loops[3] and the gauge \u03b2-function(s) \u03b2g to four loops [4].\nFor the MSSM, both \u03b2gi and the various \u03b3s were given through three loops in Ref. [5].\nThe \u03b2-functions in a general theory and the MSSM for the \"standard \" soft breaking\nterms were given to two loops in Ref. [6] and for the \"non-standard\" terms also to two\nloops in Ref. [7]. Recently, however, it has been realised[8] \u2013[10] that in the case of the\n\"standard\" terms it is possible to express the associated \u03b2-functions exactly in terms of\nsimple differential operators acting on \u03b2gi and \u03b3. It is therefore a straightforward matter\nto derive the three-loop \"standard\" soft \u03b2-functions for the MSSM and variations thereof.\nIn this paper we present three-loop running results for the MSSM with the addition of n5\nand n10 sets of SU5 5(5) and 10(10) representations respectively. A motive for grouping\nthe additional matter in this way is that complete SU5 representations do not (at one loop)\nchange the prediction of sin2 \u03b8W (or alternatively of g32 (MZ )) that follows from imposing\ng1,2,3 gauge unification. Also unchanged at one loop is the gauge unification scale, MX ;\nbut at higher loops this scale increases and can approach the string scale. (For a recent\naccount of unification at the string scale via the addition of incomplete SU5 multiplets,\nsee Ref. [11].)\nAt three loops each soft \u03b2-function has many terms and some of the coefficients are\nquite large; given this it is worthwhile checking whether perturbation theory remains good\nin the MSSM. It is generally believed that the perturbation series for QFT \u03b2-functions are\nasymptotic in nature. The exact \u03b2g in the NSVZ scheme [12] for a pure (no matter) N = 1\ntheory is clearly an exception, but in the presence of matter the perturbation series for \u03b3\n(and hence also the one for \u03b2g ) is probably asymptotic (for a discussion see Ref. [13]). It\nis interesting that even for n5 = n10 = 0 we find that, for the squark masses, three loop\n2\n\n\frunning corrections are typically larger than the two loop ones. We show explicitly how\nthe three loop corrections affect the spectrum for some of the Snowmass benchmark points\n(SPS) [14].\nAnother motive for the calculation and in particular for extending it to n5 , n10 6= 0\nis that it enables us to explore the phenomenon of \"semi-perturbative unification\" as described by Kolda and March-Russell (KMR)[15]. In this scenario, the gauge couplings\nincrease at high energies but do not quite reach a Landau pole at gauge unification (contrasting with the non-perturbative unification of Maiani et al[16], where the Landau pole\noccurs at MX ). It is then possible to argue that there is a regime where perturbation\ntheory remains reliable, but the resulting physics differs markedly from that obtained in\nthe MSSM case.2\nOur calculations improve on those of KMR by including one loop threshold corrections\nand the complete three loop running corrections; we check that (for n5 = n10 = 0) our\nresults are consistent with those presented for the SPS points in Ref. [1] and Ref. [18]. While\nwe provide more precise results, we support the conclusions of KMR by demonstrating that\nn5 , n10 6= 0 can lead to changes which are in some cases non-negligible, but are consistent\nwith perturbation theory (modulo issues associated with the squark masses which we will\ndiscuss later), and can be readily distinguished from the MSSM.\n\n2. The Soft Beta functions\nThe procedure for calculating the soft \u03b2 functions from \u03b2gi and \u03b3 is described in\nRef. [8]. The only subtlety relates to the X-function which arises in the soft scalar mass\n\u03b2-function; expressions for the leading and sub-leading contributions to this appear in\nRef. [9]. Armed with these results it is straightforward to calculate the three-loop MSSM\nsoft \u03b2-functions from the three-loop expressions for the \u03b2gi , \u03b3 given in Ref. [5]. We have\ngeneralised this whole calculation to n5 , n10 6= 0. The resulting expressions are very\nunwieldy; as an example we give the one, two and three loop results for \u03b2m2Q , in the\nt\n\napproximation that we retain only g3 and the top quark Yukawa coupling \u03bbt (in what\nfollows we denote the third generation squarks as Qt , tc , bc , the first or second generation\nsquarks as Qu , uc , dc , and we suppress 16\u03c0 2 loop factors. ):\n2\n\nFor other related work on unification at strong coupling see Ref.

For this special case, and also with n5 = n10 =\n0, the three loop result, Eq. (2.1c), was given in Ref. [19], except that in the corresponding\nexpressions in this reference the squark masses of different generations are not clearly\ndistinguished (as they must be since the third generation evolves differently from the other\ntwo). Complete results for the three loop \u03b2-functions including all three gauge couplings\nand ng \u00d7 ng Yukawa matrices may be obtained by application to the authors.\nNote that in our analysis we do not include \"tadpole\" contributions, corresponding\nto renormalisation of the Fayet-Iliopoulos (FI) D-term. These contributions are not expressible exactly in terms of \u03b2gi , \u03b3; for a discussion, and three loop results for the MSSM,\nsee Ref. [20]. For universal boundary conditions, the FI term is very small at low energies\nif it is zero at gauge unification; in this paper we restrict ourselves to universal boundary\nconditions and ignore these contributions.\n\n3. The Running Analysis\nIn this section we examine the effect of the three loop corrections on the standard running analysis. We will focus on the standard treatment with universal boundary conditions\nat gauge unification, often termed CMSSM or MSUGRA. Thus we assume that at MX\nwe have universal soft scalar masses (m0 ), gaugino masses (m 1 ) and A-parameters (A),\n2\n\nand work in the third-generation-only Yukawa coupling approximation. This is for ease\n4\n\n\fof comparison with existing results rather than because we find the scenario particularly\ncompelling. In the MSSM the corrections to the dimensionless coupling running analysis\ndue to two and three loop corrections are comparatively small[5]. As emphasised by KMR,\nhowever, this becomes less true for n5 , n10 6= 0. In particular, for n5 + 3n10 = 6, \u03b2g3 = 0\nat one loop, so that we need to consider at least two loop corrections, and also three loops\nto verify that we remain within the perturbative domain.\nWe will present results as a function of n10 (for n5 = 0); the dependence of physical\nquantities on n5 (for n10 = 0) is qualitatively similar though not identical. As remarked\nby KMR, the mass scale of these additional multiplets being unknown it makes sense to\nparametrise their effects by taking n5 , n10 to be continuous variables.\n\u03b1 ,\u03b1 ,\u03b1 vs \u03c4 for SPS1a\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n0.16\n\n0.14\n\n0.12\n\n2\n\n\u03b1 ,\u03b1 ,\u03b1\n\n3\n\n0.1\n\n1\n\n0.08\n\n0.06\n\n0.04\n\n0.02\n\n0\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\u03c4\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\nFig.1: Gauge coupling unification for n10 = 1.7. Solid, dashed, and\ndotted lines correspond to \u03b11 , \u03b12 , \u03b13 respectively.\nIn Fig. 1 we show the evolution of the gauge couplings \u03b1i = gi2 /(4\u03c0) for n10 = 1.7,\nusing three loop \u03b2-functions for all couplings. The couplings are plotted against \u03c4 =\n1\n2\u03c0\n\nln(Q/MZ ); evidently we are still in the perturbative regime. The input parameters at\n5\n\n\fMZ correspond to a typical supersymmetric mass spectrum; specifically, the Benchmark\npoint SPS1a, the details of which will be given later. We adjust input parameters according\nto the supersymmetric spectrum in order to account for threshold corrections in the manner\nof Ref. [21] 3 , and run up from MZ using the full supersymmetric \u03b2-functions; thus the\ninput values for the gauge couplings depend on the sparticle spectrum, and are determined\niteratively. We have set n10 = 1.7 because around this value the electroweak vacuum\nfails for the SPS1a input parameters; at this value it is interesting that (see Fig. 1) the\n(small) one-loop contribution to \u03b2\u03b13 is almost precisely cancelled by the two and threeloop ones. As already mentioned, if we have gauge coupling unification then this (and\nthe scale at which it occurs) is unaffected by taking n5 , n10 6= 0 in the one loop running\napproximation. This ceases to be true for two and three loop running, and we must\nassume the existence of quite large GUT-scale threshold corrections to ensure unification.\nThe unification scale corresponding to Fig. 1 (defined as where \u03b11 and \u03b12 meet) is MU \u2248\n1 \u00d7 1017 GeV, significantly higher than in the MSSM.\nTurning to the soft parameters, note that there are some large coefficients in the ex(3)\n\npression for \u03b2m2\n\nQt\n\nin Eq. (2.1c); the coefficient of the M32 g36 term, for example is O(104 ),\n\neven in the MSSM when n5 = n10 = 0. For weakly-interacting particles and the gluinos,\nthe three loop effects are quite small for zero or small n5 , n10 ; but for the squark masses\nthe three loop \u03b2-function coefficients are (at MZ ) typically (while smaller than the corresponding 1-loop coefficients) larger than the corresponding two loop coefficients (even at\nn5,10 = 0) if m 1 > m0 , as will be so, in fact, in the cases we shall present. One might well\n2\n\nbe tempted to interpret this as evidence for the asymptotic nature of the \u03b2-function series,\nas we mentioned in the Introduction. We will see the effects of this in the next section.\nAs mentioned above, we adjust the input dimensionless parameters to accommodate\nthreshold corrections[21]. We also incorporate the one-loop radiative corrections from this\nreference. For the input top mass at the weak scale we use[22]:\nh\n\u0010\n\u03b13\n43L\n3L2 \u0011\n2\nmt (Q) = mtpole 1 \u2212\n(5 \u2212 3L) \u2212 \u03b13 0.538 \u2212\n+\n3\u03c0\n24\u03c0 2 i 8\u03c0 2\n+ O(\u03b133 ) + electroweak, sparticle contributions\n3\n\n(3.1)\n\nIn the first line of Eq. 37 of Ref.

D49 is correct, however.\n\n6\n\n\fwhere L = ln[mt (Q)2 /Q2 ]. This formula is identical to one from the up-to-date version of\nAllanach et al[1].\nFor definiteness we analyse in detail particular SPS benchmark points[14], and verify\nthat our results (for n5 = n10 = 0) are in accord with those obtained with existing\ncomputational tools[1], [18].\n3.1. Benchmark point SPS 1a\nThis point is a \"typical\" point in MSUGRA parameter space, with m0 = 100GeV,\nm 1 = 250GeV, A0 = \u2212100GeV, tan \u03b2 = 10 and \u03bc > 0. In Table 1 we compare our results\n2\n\nfor a selection of sparticle masses (at n5 = n10 = 0) with the spread of results quoted in\nAKP (note our convention that the predominantly R-handed top squark is t\u03032 ).\n\nmass\n\n1loop\n\n2loops\n\n3loops\n\nAKP\n\ng\u0303\n\n630\n\n615\n\n612\n\n594 \u2212 626\n\nt\u03032\n\n404\n\n403\n\n395\n\n379 \u2212 410\n\n\u0169L\n\n571\n\n563\n\n555\n\n536 \u2212 570\n\n\u0169R\n\n551\n\n547\n\n538\n\n520 \u2212 569\n\nLSP\n\n105\n\n97\n\n97\n\n96.4 \u2212 97.6\n\nTable 1: Sparticle masses (in GeV) for the SPS1a point\nWe would expect our two loop results to correspond most closely to AKP and we\nsee that they are indeed consistent.

The contributions\n2\n\nof \u03bc, A0 to the off-diagonal term in the stop mass matrix have the same sign, and the\nmagnitude of A0 is large, resulting in a light stop.

The light stop mass comes from a\n2 \u00d7 2 matrix with large off-diagonal entries; the large three loop shift is caused essentially\nby the changes in all the entries due to the comparatively large contributions to the three\nloop soft \u03b2-functions, as we described earlier. The mass of the light stop is also very\nsensitive indeed to the input mt (MZ ), which in turn depends on the sparticle spectrum\nand the input top pole mass (which we have taken to be 174.3GeV). However (for a given\nmtpole ), mt (MZ ) changes very little when we include the 3 loop corrections. Note that\nour two loop result is slightly above the range obtained by AKP. It is also very sensitive\nto n5 , n10 ; in Figure 4 we again plot the light stop/gluino mass ratio against n10 : this\ntime the electroweak vacuum fails for n10 \u2248 0.3. Remarkably, the three loop and two loop\ncorrections cancel almost exactly near n10 = 0, while at n10 \u223c 0.3 the two loop corrections\nare rather small.\n9\n\n\fLight stop/gluino mass ratio vs n10 for SPS5\n0.36\n\n0.34\n\n0.32\n\nLight stop/gluino mass ratio\n\n0.3\n\n0.28\n\n0.26\n\n0.24\n\n0.22\n\n0.2\n\n0.18\n\n0.16\n\n0\n\n0.05\n\n0.1\n\n0.15\n\n0.2\n\n0.25\n\n0.3\n\n0.35\n\nn10\n\nFig.4: Plot of the light stop/gluino mass ratio against n10 for SPS5.\nSolid, dashed and dotted lines correspond to one, two and three loop\nrunning respectively.\nLSP/gluino mass ratio vs n10 for SPS5\n0.174\n\n0.172\n\n0.17\n\nLSP/gluino mass ratio\n\n0.168\n\n0.166\n\n0.164\n\n0.162\n\n0.16\n\n0.158\n\n0.156\n\n0\n\n0.05\n\n0.1\n\n0.15\n\n0.2\n\n0.25\n\n0.3\n\n0.35\n\nn10\n\nFig.5: Plot of the LSP/gluino mass ratio against n10 for SPS5.

Here we see that the impact of the three loop running corrections is\nless marked but still appreciable as n10 increases.\n\n4. Conclusions\nWe have extended typical detailed running coupling analyses for a selection of MSSM\nSPS benchmark points to incorporate three loop \u03b2-function corrections for the running\nmasses and couplings. Generally speaking the effect of the three loop running corrections\nis at most 2% and of the same size or smaller than that of the two loop corrections,\nexcept for squark masses where it can be larger; simply because the three-loop \u03b2-function\ncoefficients are larger than the two-loop ones. For the light stop mass for the SPS5 point,\nwe see an 8% effect; this happens because this mass results from the diagonalisation of a\nmatrix with large off diagonal entries which all change as described above. We have also\nperformed the same analysis for the MSSM extended to incorporate additional matter in\nthe form of SU5 5 and 10 representations. As the amount of such matter is increased the\neffect of two and three loop corrections becomes more dramatic, as the one-loop \u03b2-function\nfor \u03b13 decreases.\nGiven some detail of the sparticle spectrum, it will be comparatively easy to distinguish, for example, the CMSSM and AMSB scenarios; however in the context of the\nformer, disentangling the possible impact of additional matter and the effect of radiative\ncorrections will be more difficult.\nOne may expect in general that two loop threshold/pole mass corrections will be\ncompetitive with the three loop running corrections that we have described, and so for\naccurate predictions one should include both. At this level one is also sensitive to the\nexperimental uncertainty in mt (for the light stop sometimes very sensitive, as we have\ndescribed) and the strong coupling \u03b13 (MZ ). It is feasible that by the time sparticles are\ndiscovered complete two loop threshold corrections will be available, and that both these\nuncertainties will also be reduced, so that significantly more accurate sparticle spectrum\npredictions will be possible. It appears, however, from the apparently asymptotic nature\nof the squark mass \u03b2-functions that squark mass predictions with an accuracy greater than\naround 2% will not be possible using perturbation theory.\n11\n\n\fAcknowledgements\nDRTJ was supported by a PPARC Senior Fellowship, and was visiting the Aspen\nCenter for Physics while part of this work was done.
