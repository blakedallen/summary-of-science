Box 218, Yorktown Heights, New York 10598\n(Dated: August 28, 2018)\nWith the help of a multi-configurational Green's function approach we simulate single-electron\nCoulomb charging effects in gated ultimately scaled nanostructures which are beyond the scope\nof a selfconsistent mean-field description. From the simulated Coulomb-blockade characteristics\nwe derive effective system capacitances and demonstrate how quantum confinement effects give\nrise to corrections. Such deviations are crucial for the interpretation of experimentally determined\ncapacitances and the extraction of application-relevant system parameters.\nPACS numbers: 73.63.-b, 72.10.-d, 73.23.-b, 73.22.-f\n\nOne of the major challenges for the simulation of electronic transport in low-dimensional nanostructures consists in an adequate description of the Coulomb interaction. In ultimately scaled semiconductor nanosystems,\nonly a few electrons constitute the current. Thus, the details of the electron-electron interaction may become crucial for the electronic properties, as can be seen in experimentally observed single-electron charging effects in carbon nanotubes and III/V nanowhiskers [1, 2]. The channel region of a typical application-relevant nanostructure\ninvolves on the order of 100 single-particle states (or\nsites) and can be highly inhomogeneous and anisotropic.\nHere, external contacts and gate electrodes in general introduce non-linear perturbations to the system. Hence,\nhighly idealized interacting few-level models with a small\nnumber of effective parameters (constants) become inadequate. For a realistic simulation of quantum transport\nin application-relevant nanodevices, various approaches\nhave been used, differing in the formulation of Coulomb\ninteraction and contact coupling. While the orthodox\ntheory [3, 4] correctly describes few-electron effects such\nas single-electron tunneling in quasi-isolated quantum\ndot systems, the nonequilibrium Green's function formalism (NEGF) [5, 6, 7, 8] also accounts for contact renormalization and dissipation terms. However, the NEGF\nbecomes unable to describe the details of charging effects\nof a few fluctuating electrons as soon as a mean-field approximation is introduced.\nRecently, we have presented a multi-configurational\napproach (MCSCG) [9], which represents a consistent\nextension of the mean-field NEGF for the inclusion of\nsingle-electron effects under application-relevant conditions. This approach combines the simplicity and scalability of the mean-field NEGF with a many-body Fock\nspace description of the Coulomb interaction of those\nelectrons that are resonantly trapped within the nanostructure. As a key element, the algorithm identifies \"rel-\n\ndrain\n\netag\n\ngate\n\noxide\ndox\nsource\n\nL\ndch\nFIG. 1:\n\nSchematic sketch of the considered coaxially gated\nnanosystem (see text for more details).\n\nevant\" trapped single-particle states that are subject to\noccupation fluctuations. Within the resulting relevant\nFock subspace, many-body \"configurations\" \u03ba and associated weights w\u03ba are defined as eigenstates and eigenvalues of the projected many-body statistical operator \u03c1MB ,\nrespectively. Consequently, the systemP\nGreen's functions\nare written as weighted averages: \u1e20 = \u03ba w\u03ba G[\u03ba], where\nG[\u03ba] follows from a Dyson equation with a suitable selfenergy approximation \u03a3[\u03ba]. As a self-consistency condition, \u03c1MB is obtained by use of the projected manybody Hamiltonian H MB and the subsidiary condition\nthat GMB should resemble \u1e20 within the relevant subspace, where GMB is calculated via \u03c1MB and H MB .\nIn this article, we show how the MCSCG formalism\ncan be used to calculate electronic transport properties of gated one-dimensional (1D) nanosystems in the\nsingle-electron tunneling regime beyond the mean-field\napproach. Furthermore, we extract realistic system capacitances from the simulated I-V characteristics. Three\nlength scales are relevant for the Coulomb interaction\nenergies of the system: The geometrical length L, the\nelectrostatic screening length \u03bb, and the de Broglie wavelength of the electron. The latter becomes important in a\nnanoscale system with quantum confinement, giving rise\nto significant deviations from the expected capacitances.\n\n\f2\nIn the following, we discuss a 1D nanostructure (i.e.,\none lateral mode only) as depicted in Fig. 1. In the shown\ncoaxial geometry, the channel is surrounded by a metallic gate electrode, separated by an insulating oxide layer.\nThe 1D channel of the nanostructure is connected to two\nSchottky contacts (denoted as source and drain) which\nserve as electron reservoirs [15]. In order to visualize the\nelectronic structure of the system, a radial cut through\nthe inner region of the structure has been inserted, showing the groundstate probability density |\u03c8(x)|2 and the\nassociated local density of states (LDOS) for 1 electron\ninside the channel. For the discussion of interaction effects we will now consider an example of an ultimately\nscaled semiconducting nanocolumn (see also [9]) with an\neffective channel length of L = 19nm, a channel diameter of dch = 4nm and an oxide thickness of dox = 10nm.\nFurthermore, we chose \u01ebch = 15 and \u01ebox = 3.9, yielding\na screening length of \u03bb \u2248 3.7nm. The latter is obtained\nfrom\n\u0013\n\u0012\ndox\n\u01ebch d2ch\n2\n(1)\nln 1 + 2\n\u03bb =\n\u01ebox 8\ndch\nfor a coaxial system layout [10]. The Schottky source and\ndrain contacts exhibit a barrier of \u03a6B = 0.5eV (with respect to the Fermi energy), whereas the effective electron\nmass is taken as m\u2217 = 0.05me . This parameter set was\nchosen in order to clearly visualize the Coulomb effects,\nat the same time being close enough to experimental realizations.\nFig. 2(a) shows a simulated grayscale map of the drain\ncurrent as a function of the applied gate and drain voltages in the single-electron tunneling regime (T = 77K)\n[16]. One can clearly identify the typical diamondlike shaped black areas of Coulomb blockade with a\nsuppressed drain current. Dark-gray areas correspond\nto electronic transport through the lowest longitudinal\nresonantly-trapped state, whereas brighter areas involve\nthe first (and higher) excited resonances. Such a behavior is beyond the capabilities of a mean-field NEGF\nthat is based on a selfconsistent potential, demonstrating the strengths of the employed multi-configurational\napproach. In order to visualize the interaction mechanism that goes beyond mean-field, Fig. 2(b) shows the\nlocal density of states (LDOS) within the channel region\nat different voltage conditions and the associated meanfield potentials. For the empty channel \"0\", we obtain a\nset of quasi-bound states and resulting resonances. With\none electron inside the channel near equilibrium point\n\"1\", one electron occupies the lowest state and all further states are shifted to higher energies by the Coulomb\ninteraction. Note that the electron does not experience\nits own Hartree potential. Finally, under strong nonequilibrium bias conditions at point \"X\", the spectral\nproperties result from a weighted mixture of an empty\nchannel and a channel containing one electron. Here,\nthe electronic properties clearly deviate from a mean-field\n\nFIG. 2: (a) Simulated single-electron tunneling characteristics as\na function of the applied gate and drain voltages for T =77K. Here,\nthe absolute value of the drain current is mapped to a non-linear\ngrayscale. Within the black diamonds of Coulomb blockade the\nelectron number becomes quantized as indicated by white numbers.\n\u2206VG and \u2206VD denote the width and half height of the first diamond, respectively. (b) Corresponding local density of states and\nmean-field potential within the channel for selected points 0,1,X\nin map (a). Point X corresponds to a nonequilibrium state with\nelectron number \u2248 0.3.\n\npicture.\nFor the considered example, the height of the Coulomb\ndiamond with 1 electron is determined by the Coulomb\ninteraction of two electrons with opposite spin within the\nlowest channel resonance (groundstate). In contrast, for\nthe second diamond one has to consider not only the interaction between the lowest and the first excited states\nbut also the difference between the single-particle energies of the two involved states. Hence, its size is significantly enlarged. These observations strongly depend on\nthe degeneracy of the considered channel resonances and\non the ratio of quantization and Coulomb energies. In\nultimately scaled systems that are addressed in this letter, the longitudinal quantization energy dominates and\nit is justified to consider the groundstate Coulomb matrix element only. In contrast, for longer channels, the\nquantization energy may become much smaller than the\ncharging energy and we could end up with a situation\n\n\f3\nwhere the occupation of higher excited states (with a reduced Coulomb matrix element) and a re-organization\nof electrons might become energetically favorable for the\naddition of the next electron [11] (and Wigner molecules\nmight form [12]). In the following, we restrict ourselves\nto the discussion of the lowest Coulomb diamond which\ncorresponds to the onset of the current flow.\nIn general, effective quantities such as the gate capac\u2217\nitance CG\nand the total system capacitance C\u03a3\u2217 can be\nextracted from the shape of the observed Coulomb diamonds [13] (provided that the latter is solely due to\nCoulomb interaction): From the total width \u2206VG and\n\u2217\nhalf height \u2206VD one obtains CG\n= e/\u2206VG and C\u03a3\u2217 =\ne/\u2206VD , respectively. In our example (Fig. 2), we have\n\u2217\n\u2206VG \u2248 114mV and 2\u2206VD \u2248 186mV, and therefore CG\n\u2248\n\u2217\n1.41aF and C\u03a3 \u2248 1.72aF. Consequently, a Coulomb in\u2217\nteraction energy of E\u03a3\n= e2 /C\u03a3\u2217 \u2248 93meV can be derived\n(which is identical to a two-particle Coulomb matrixelement, see Ref. [9]). Note that for such ultra-short\nnanosystems, where the quantization effects play an important role, these capacitances in general are voltage\ndependent quantities, depending on the wave functions\nof the involved longitudinal channel resonances that are\nbeing filled at the considered electrode voltages.\nFor the classical capacitance of the considered coaxial\ngeometry of the 1D channel region one obtains\nCox =\n\nL\n\u03c0\u01eb0 \u01ebch d2ch L\n\u0011.\n= 2\u03c0\u01eb0 \u01ebox \u0010\n4\u03bb2\nln 1 + 2 dox\n\nthe center region of the 1D channel due to quantum confinement in transport direction which is a result of the\nSchottky-barriers at the source and drain contacts. In\nother words, the electron is spatially confined within a\nreduced effective channel length < L. This implies an\n\u2217\nincreased Coulomb interaction energy E\u03a3\n= 93meV comhom\npared to E\u03a3 = 43meV for a homogenous charge distribution, or equivalently C\u03a3\u2217 < C\u03a3hom [17]. Consequently,\nlarger voltage changes are required to add one further\nelectron to the channel region. This implies that care\nhas to be taken with the extraction of geometrical parameters from experimental data as will be discussed in\nmore detail below.\n\n(2)\n\ndch\n\nEmploying the Coulomb Green's function (for details see\nRef. [9]) for fixed potential boundary conditions, the\nhom\nCoulomb interaction energy E\u03a3\nof a homogeneously\ndistributed test charge e with an identical background\nhom\ncharge thus reads as E\u03a3\n= e2 /C\u03a3hom with the total\nhomogenous system capacitance\nC\u03a3hom\n\n= Cox\n\ncosh( L ) \u2212 1\n1\u22122 L \u03bb L\n\u03bb sinh( \u03bb )\n\n!\u22121\n\n.\n\n(3)\n\n(Note that C\u03a3hom > Cox and C\u03a3hom \u2192 Cox for L/\u03bb \u2192 \u221e.)\nUsing the given parameters, we thus obtain Cox = 2.30aF\nand C\u03a3hom = 3.75 aF. In this context, we therefore define\nthe quantity\n\nFIG. 3: (a) Simulated capacitances for the first two electrons as a\n\n(4)\n\nfunction of the channel length L with an adaptive gate voltage. The\nscreening length \u03bb \u2248 3.7nm and the effective mass m\u2217 = 0.05me are\nhom /C \u2217\nkept constant. (b) Quantum confinement factor f\u03a3 = C\u03a3\n\u03a3\n\u2217 /C \u2217 as derived from (a).\nand gate efficiency \u03b7G = CG\n\u03a3\n\nwhich we refer to as the \"quantum confinement factor\"\nfor the given geometrical structure and parameters (voltages, etc.). In the example above, we have f\u03a3 \u2248 2.2. The\nobservation that f\u03a3 becomes > 1 for ultimately scaled\nstructures can easily be understood if one takes a look at\nthe quasi-bound single-electron wave function (Fig. 2(b))\nof the considered Coulomb diamond: Typically, this wave\nfunction exhibits an enhanced probability amplitude in\n\nFig. 3(a) shows the simulated capacitances for the\nfirst two electrons (groundstate wave function and next\nhigher state) as a function of the channel length L for\na fixed \u03bb and m\u2217 . Here, the gate voltage VG is chosen adaptively such that the groundstate energy coincides with the Fermi energy of the source contact (for\na constant Schottky barrier height \u03a6B = 0.5eV with\nVD \u2261 VS \u2261 0). For each L, the wave function and the\n\nf\u03a3 =\n\ne2\ne2\n= C\u03a3hom \u2206VD /e,\n/\nC\u03a3\u2217 C\u03a3hom\n\n\f4\n\u2217\nassociated Coulomb interaction energy E\u03a3\n= e2 /C\u03a3\u2217 have\nbeen obtained via numerical diagonalization of the channel Hamiltonian [9]. As expected, for larger L/\u03bb we ob\u2217\nserve that C\u03a3\u2217 \u2192 CG\nand C\u03a3hom \u2192 Cox , which means that\nthe source and drain influence becomes negligible in this\nlimit. On the other hand, for the ultra-short structure\nwith L < 20nm, one can clearly identify the increasing\ninfluence of the source and drain capacitances. Therefore, an increased gate voltage becomes necessary to pull\nthe lowest quasi-bound state down to the Fermi energy\nof the source contact for a fixed Schottky barrier height\n(e.g., VG = 0.52V for L = 50nm, and VG = 1.1V for\nL = 10nm). This is described quantitatively by the effi\u2217\nciency \u03b7G = CG\n/C\u03a3\u2217 = \u2206VD /\u2206VG of the gate electrode\nat changing the considered quasi-bound energy level, as\nplotted in Fig. 3(b).\nMost noticeably for all ranges of L/\u03bb, there is a sig\u2217\nnificant deviation of C\u03a3\u2217 from C\u03a3hom (and CG\nfrom Cox )\nas can be seen in Fig. 3(a). This observation, in fact,\nis described by the quantum confinement factor f\u03a3 as\nplotted in Fig. 3(b). In the short-channel regime, we obtain f\u03a3 > 1, which can be explained by the longitudinal\nconfinement of the groundstate wave function and the\nresulting increased Coulomb interaction. Furthermore,\nas can be seen in Fig. 3, the onset of the short-channel\nregime, where \u03b7G deviates significantly from 1 due to increasing source and drain influence, is shifted to smaller\nchannel lengths L < 30nm compared to L > 50nm where\nC\u03a3hom starts to deviate from Cox . Again, this finding\ncan be attributed to the longitudinal confinement of the\nwave function with a reduced electron charge density at\nthe source and drain contacts. For larger channel lengths\nL, however, we observe a rapid decrease of f\u03a3 (or equiv\u2217\nalently, a strong increase of C\u03a3\u2217 and CG\n). This finding\ncan be attributed to the onset of a Wigner regime due to\na significantly reduced average electron density (because\nof an increasing spatial separation of the two considered\nelectrons compared to \u03bb).\nThe discussed confinement effect becomes very important for the experimental determination of applicationrelevant capacitances from measured Coulomb diamonds.\nAnalogous to the interpretation of our simulation results\n\u2217\ncan be calcuabove, effective capacitances C\u03a3\u2217 and CG\nlated from the experimentally determined values of \u2206VD\n\u2217\nand \u2206VG at low temperatures (typically 4kB T < E\u03a3\n).\nOne has to be careful with the interpretation of these\neffective capacitances as far as the derivation of geometrical parameters from the latter and their relevance at\nroom-temperature are concerned. For example, it is possible to calculate dox from C\u03a3\u2217 . By inspecting Eqs. (14), however, one can see that this is a non-trivial task\nsince \u03bb depends on dox , and f\u03a3 (which results from a\nCoulomb matrix-element) in turn depends on \u03bb. If we\nidentified C\u03a3hom with C\u03a3\u2217 \u2261 e/\u2206VD (i.e., setting f\u03a3 \u2261 1)\n\nfrom experimental data, we would overestimate dox . In\nthe considered example, we would end up with dox >\n50nm (instead of 10nm) which is a consequence of the\nlogarithm in Eqs. (1,2).\nIn conclusion, we have demonstrated that the multiconfigurational selfconsistent Green's function approach\n(MCSCG) is able to model single-electron Coulomb\ncharging effects in ultimetely scaled gated 1D nanostructures, providing a means for the determination of interaction energies and resulting effective capacitances. In\nturn, a quantitative discussion of quantum confinement\ncorrections to the system capacitance was given, resulting\nin a significant deviation from the classical capacitance\nwhich has an immediate consequence for the interpretation of experimental system parameters.\n\n\u2217\nElectronic address: m.indlekofer@fz-juelich.de\n[1] M.
