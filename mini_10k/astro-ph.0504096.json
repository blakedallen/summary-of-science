INTRODUCTION\n\nThe neutralino predicted by the supersymmetry theory of particle physics is the most promising candidate\nof the cold dark matter (CDM). The theory predicts\nthat neutralinos should annihilate and produce high energy particles such as gamma-rays, and the detectability of these particles from dense regions like the Galactic center (GC) has been discussed intensively in the\nliterature. [See Bertone et al. (2004) for a review and\nreferences therein for the earlier papers.] The structure formation theory predicts hierarchical substructure\nin a dark matter halo, and this clumpiness is expected\nto enhance the annihilation signal. Previous investigations, however, considered substructures only to the\nfirst order (i.e., isolated subhaloes in a halo) and masses\nlarger than \u223c 106 M\u2299 , mainly because of the limitation\nof cosmological N-body simulations (Ullio et al. 2002;\nTaylor and Silk 2003; Elsaesser and Mannheim 2005).\nRecently attention has been turned to substructures\non much smaller scale, especially the first gravitationally bound objects in the cosmological evolution. If\nthe dark matter is the neutralino, any density fluctuations of mass scales smaller than Mmh \u223c 10\u22126 M\u2299\nare washed out by collisional damping and subsequent\nfree streaming in the early universe. Then the first\nobjects form as \"microhaloes\" with a mass \u223c Mmh at\nz \u223c znl , where znl = 60 \u00b1 20 is the epoch when the rms\nlinear density fluctuation at this mass scale, \u03c3(Mmh ),\nbecomes unity (Hofmann et al. 2001; Green et al. 2004,\n2005; Berezinsky et al. 2003; Loeb & Zaldarriaga 2005).\nTherefore a considerable part of the neutralino dark matter should have collapsed into these earth-mass objects,\nat least once in the cosmic history.\nHowever, it is highly uncertain how much fraction of\n1 Department of Astronomy, School of Science, Kyoto University,\nSakyo-ku, Kyoto 606-8502, Japan\n2 Department of Physics, School of Science, Kyoto University,\nSakyo-ku, Kyoto 606-8502, Japan\nElectronic address: takeshi@kusastro.kyoto-u.ac.jp\n\nthese microhaloes can survive the subsequent hierarchical structure formation until present. Berezinsky et al.\n(2003) estimated that only 0.1\u20130.5 % of microhaloes survive, because of tidal disruption when they are taken\ninto larger haloes. This is, however, a completely analytic estimate and uncertainty must be large. On the\nother hand, Diemand et al. (2005), based on a N-body\nsimulation, argued that about 50% of the total halo\nmass Mtot is in the form of substructure with a subhalo mass function dN/dM \u221d M \u2212\u03bc in the mass range\n10\u22126 < M < 1010 M\u2299 , where \u03bc \u223c 2. This indicates that the mass fraction of microhaloes is at least\n2\n[dN (Mmh )/dM ]/Mtot \u223c 1.3%. Furthermore, the\nMmh\nnested nature of hierarchical structure formation predicts that microhaloes may be embedded in larger subhaloes, which may again be embedded in even larger\nones. Counting microhaloes in larger mass subhaloes\nup to M \u223c 1010 M\u2299 will further increase the true number of earth-mass microhaloes. Diemand et al. (2005)\nused 500 pc\u22123 as the number density of such microhaloes in the solar neighborhood, which is about 7% of\nthe standard dark matter density at the Sun's location,\n\u03c1(R\u2299 ) = 0.3 GeV cm\u22123 (Bertone et al. 2004). In addition to the tidal disruption by hierarchical clustering, microhaloes may also be destroyed by tidal interaction with\nstars in the Galactic disk (Zhao et al. 2005; Moore et al.\n2005), but again estimates are controversial.\nIt is obvious that such microhaloes could have significant impact on the detectability of the annihilation\nsignal. Here we show that both the galactic and extragalactic gamma-ray background radiation (hereafter\nGGRB and EGRB, respectively) give a strong constraint\non the existence of such microhaloes. Since the microhalo survival probability is highly uncertain, we simply\nparametrize this quantity as fsurv , and try to estimate\nhow much constraints can be set from existing and future\nobservations. It has been argued that neutralino annihilation cannot be a significant component of the observed\nEGRB data since it would overpredict the gamma-ray\n\n\f2\n\nODA ET AL.\n\nflux from the GC beyond the observational upper bound\n(Ando 2005). This argument does not apply here, because the microhaloes are likely disrupted by strong tidal\nforces of the GC gravity field and/or interaction with\nstars within \u223c kpc of the GC (Diemand et al. 2005) and\nhence the visibility of the GC is not enhanced by the\nmicrohaloes. However, the mass included within 1 (10)\nkpc is only 0.3 (6) % of the total mass of the Galactic\nhalo (Klypin et al. 2002). Therefore the total gammaray flux from microhaloes in a galactic halo, to which\nthe EGRB is related, is hardly affected by tidal disruption in its central region, if microhaloes trace the mass\ndistribution.\n2. GAMMA-RAY BACKGROUND FROM MICROHALOES\n2.1. Estimating GGRB and EGRB Flux\n\nIn this work we assume that microhaloes are formed\nat redshift \u223c znl , and a fraction (1 \u2212 fsurv ) of them are\nimmediately destroyed by tidal forces in subsequent hierarchical structure formation. After that, we assume that\nthe number of microhaloes and their density profile are\nkept constant until present, except in regions very close\nto galactic halo centers. These are not unreasonable,\nsince the tidal force within an object is proportional to its\ninternal density, and the mean density within virialized\nobjects decreases with the cosmic expansion in proportion to the mean background density. Therefore we expect that the tidal disruption at a typical location within\na dark halo should occur most efficiently at redshift not\nvery different from znl , when isolated microhaloes are\nfirst taken into larger objects.\nConsider a region in the universe with the mass\nscale Mmh whose linear fractional overdensity is \u03b4 =\n\u03b4\u03c1/\u03c1 \u221d (1 + z)\u22121 . According to the standard structure formation theory, the height over the rms, \u03bd \u2261\n\u03b4/\u03c3(Mmh ), obeys to the Gaussian, i.e., the comoving\nnumber density of microhaloes\ngiven by dnmh /d\u03bd =\n\u221a\nfsurv \u03a9\u03c7 \u03c1crit,0 exp(\u2212\u03bd 2 /2)/( 2\u03c0Mmh ), where we use the\nWMAP values (Spergel et al. 2003) for the present-day\ncritical density \u03c1crit,0 and the neutralino density parameter \u03a9\u03c7 = 0.22. At z \u223c znl the universe is flat and\nmatter-dominated, and the region will collapse and virialize when \u03b4 grows to \u03b4c = 1.686 at z = zvir , where\n(1 + zvir ) = (1 + znl )\u03bd/\u03b4c . The internal density of microhaloes is given as \u03c1eff (\u03bd) = 18\u03c0 2 fc (1 + zvir )3 \u03a9\u03c7 \u03c1crit,0 .\nHere, fc is the enhancement factor from the virial density,\nto take into account the density profile of each microhalo;\nwe found that the mass-weighted mean density, which\nis proportional to the annihilation rate, is increased by\nfc = 6.2 for the microhalo profile3 found in the simulation (Diemand et al. 2005).\nThen, integrating over \u03bd, the comoving annihilation\nrate density is given by:\nZ \u221e\nh\u03c3\u03c7\u03c7 \u03c5i dnmh\nd\u03bd ,\n(1)\nMmh \u03c1eff (\u03bd)\n\u1e44\u03c7\u03c7 =\n2m2\u03c7\nd\u03bd\n\u03bdl\nwhere m\u03c7 is the neutralino mass and h\u03c3\u03c7\u03c7 \u03c5i being the\nmean velocity-multiplied cross section of neutralino annihilation. Throughout this letter we use the standard\nvalue of h\u03c3\u03c7\u03c7 \u03c5i = 3\u00d710\u221226 cm3 s\u22121 (Bertone et al. 2004),\n3 The \u03b1\u03b2\u03b3-profile with (\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3) = (1, 3, 1.2) and the concentration parameter c = 1.6.\n\nand scaling for different values is obvious. The possible\nrange of m\u03c7 is \u223c 30 GeV \u2013 10 TeV (Bertone et al. 2004),\nand we use m\u03c7 = 100 GeV for calculations below, unless otherwise stated. Since \u03c1eff \u221d \u03bd 3 , the annihilation\nsignal comes mainly from\n\u221a microhaloes of \u223c \u03bdp sigma\nfluctuation, where \u03bdp \u2261 3. Microhaloes with \u03bd \u226a 1\nmay not gravitationally collapse or would be disrupted\nby subsequent structure formation, but the integration\nis not very sensitive to the lower bound, and hence we\ntake \u03bdl = 0. Note that, by this formulation, fsurv is effectively the survival probability for microhaloes having\nrelatively high density fluctuation of \u03bd \u223c \u03bdp , and their\nmass fraction\u221ain the total dark matter, fm , is related\nas: fm \u223c (1/ 2\u03c0) exp(\u2212\u03bdp2 /2)fsurv \u223c 0.09fsurv . Assuming that the spatial distribution of microhaloes traces\nthe smoothed mass over larger scales, the number density of microhaloes with \u03bd \u223c \u03bdp around the solar system is n(R\u2299 ) \u223c fm \u03c1(R\u2299 )/Mmh \u223c 680fsurv pc\u22123 . This\nnumber is close to the estimate based on the simulation,\n\u223c 500 pc\u22123 (Diemand et al. 2005), indicating that fsurv\ncould be of order unity.\nNow we can calculate the EGRB photon flux from microhaloes per steradian, as:\nZ\ndF\u03b3 c \u1e44\u03c7\u03c7 znl dt dn\u03b3 [(1 + z)E\u03b3 ]\n=\n(1 + z) , (2)\ndz\ndE\u03b3\n4\u03c0\ndz\ndE\u03b3\n0\nwhere E\u03b3 is the gamma-ray energy and its spectrum produced by an annihilation, dn\u03b3 /dE\u03b3 , is calculated using\nthe analytical fitting formula given in Bergst\u00f6m et al.\n(2001). (We consider only the continuum gamma-rays.)\nThe integration up to the redshift znl is an approximation, but it is almost insensitive to this upper bound\nsince annihilation at z . 1 is dominant to the EGRB.\nHigh energy gamma-rays may be absorbed by interaction with the cosmic infrared background. However, in\nthis letter we consider only E\u03b3 \u2264 100 GeV, and at this\nphoton energy the optical depth becomes unity only beyond z \u223c 2 (Totani and Takeuchi 2002). Therefore our\nresult is hardly affected by the absorption.\nNext we calculate the GGRB flux. The annihilation\nrate per unit dark matter mass in a region smoothed\nover larger scales than microhaloes is given by \u1e44\u03c7\u03c7 =\n\u1e44\u03c7\u03c7 /(\u03a9\u03c7 \u03c1crit,0 ). Then we obtain the GGRB flux per\nsteradian as:\nZ\ndF\u03b3\n\u1e44\u03c7\u03c7 dn\u03b3 (E\u03b3 )\n=\n\u03c1sm dl ,\n(3)\ndE\u03b3\n4\u03c0\ndE\u03b3\nl.o.s.\nwhere the integration is over the line of sight, for the\nsmoothed dark matter density in the Galactic halo, \u03c1sm .\nIt should be noted that the flux is proportional to the\nline-of-sight integration of \u03c11sm , not \u03c12sm as in the case of\ndiffuse matter distribution. We use two spherically symmetric models of \u03c1sm (Klypin et al. 2002); one has the\nNavarro-Frenk-White (NFW, Navarro et al. 1996) profile but the other is modified from the NFW profile by\nadiabatic compression of dark matter responding to the\nbaryon infall. As discussed above, microhaloes are expected to be destroyed by tidal forces in the inner region\naround the GC. Therefore, as a simple model, we introduce the disruption radius Rd within which microhaloes\nare completely disrupted, while they are all preserved\noutside Rd with an abundance proportional to fsurv .\n\n\fGamma-rays from First Cosmological Objects\n2.2. Comparison to Observations\nThe calculated EGRB flux is shown in Fig. 1 for m\u03c7 =\n100 GeV and 1 TeV. If fsurv & 0.1, the microhaloes make\na significant contribution to the observed EGRB flux\n(Strong et al. 2004a) in some photon energy range. The\npredicted flux is much higher than those in earlier studies (Ullio et al. 2002; Taylor and Silk 2003; Ando 2005);\nthis is mainly because the microhaloes formed much\nearlier than galactic haloes considered in these studies\n(M & 105\u22126 M\u2299 ) and hence have much higher internal\ndensity. The GGRB flux from the microhaloes, which is\nthe mean in the all sky except for the disk region 4 , is\nalso shown in this figure. It is found to be comparable to\nthe EGRB, indicating that it could also be a significant\ncomponent of the observed flux. It should be noted that,\nsince the \"observed\" EGRB data was estimated as the\nresidual after the subtraction of the cosmic-ray interaction model in our Galaxy, not only the EGRB but also\nthe GGRB expected from microhaloes should be compared to the observed EGRB data.\nFigure 2 shows the predicted total flux (EGRB +\nGGRB) as a function of the Galactic longitude. It can\nbe seen that, if Rd & 5 kpc, the anisotropy of the background flux is at most a factor of 2. This is acceptable,\nconsidering the precision of the EGRB flux measurements and possible systematic uncertainties in the foreground subtraction (Sreekumar et al. 1998; Strong et al.\n2004a; Keshet et al. 2004). Even smaller Rd may also be\nallowed, since the anisotropy close to the GC would be\nhidden by strong background flux from cosmic-ray interactions in the Galactic disk.\nIn fact, evidence for a diffuse gamma-ray halo towards\nthe GC that cannot be explained by the standard cosmicray interaction model has been reported (Dixon et al.\n1998), at a flux level similar to the EGRB. This gammaray halo might be explained by the microhaloes with an\nappropriate choice of Rd . The GGRB sky distribution\nis expected to show strong small-scale anisotropy by the\ncomplicated substructures in the Galactic halo. Since\nannihilation signal peaks in rather narrow photon energy\nrange, the gamma-ray energy dependence of the GGRB\nanisotropy may be used to examine the contribution from\nmicrohaloes.\nThe EGRET background data around the disk region\nshows so-called GeV excess over the standard prediction\nfrom cosmic-ray interaction, which is about 1\u20132 orders\nof magnitude higher than the EGRB along the Galactic\ndisk (Hunter et al. 1997). The flux level of the excess\nmight be achieved by microhaloes with a large boost factor from our prediction above, which is, in fact, not very\nunlikely (see below). However, still the GeV excess seems\ndifficult to explain by the microhaloes, because the spatial distribution of the GeV excess is clearly associated\nwith the Galactic disk while distribution of microhaloes\nis expected to be more spherical. Note that the GeV excess can also be explained by modification of the cosmicray interaction models (Strong et al. 2004b; Kamae et al.\n2005).\nIt should be noted that the internal density profile of\nthe microhaloes used above is conservative in a sense that\n4 The removed disk region is the same as defined by Strong et al.\n(2004a), for a consistent comparison between the prediction and\nthe data.\n\n3\n\nit predicts relatively low annihilation luminosity. Though\nwe have used the \u03b1\u03b2\u03b3 profile with \u03b3 = 1.2 following the\nfitting by Diemand et al. (2005) (\u03c1 \u221d r\u2212\u03b3 with r \u2192 0),\ntheir simulated microhaloes have \u03b3 \u223c 1.7 to the resolution limit of the simulation. They also noticed the similarity between their simulated microhaloes and galactic haloes shortly after the formation or major mergers,\nshowing a single power law profile with slopes of \u03b3 \u223c 1.5\u2013\n2. If \u03b3 > 1.5, annihilation luminosity diverges in the center, and assuming that the maximum density is limited\nby annihilation time scale, \u03c1max h\u03c3\u03c7\u03c7 \u03c5i/(2m\u03c7 ) < (1010\nyr)\u22121 , we find that the enhancement factor fc = 6.2 used\nabove (for \u03b3 = 1.2) will be boosted up to fc = 31, 190,\nand 1.4 \u00d7 104 for \u03b3 = 1.5, 1.7, and 2.0, respectively. Here\nwe used consistently (and conservatively) a low value for\nthe concentration parameter, c = 1.6, as found in the\nsimulation (Diemand et al. 2005).\nProvided that annihilation cross section is close to the\nstandard value, the two major astrophysically uncertain\nparameters are fsurv and fc . We note that the background flux is only weakly dependent on Mmh . The\nformation redshift znl depends on Mmh , but only very\nweakly, because \u03c3(M ) is only weakly dependent on M\nin small scales under the standard CDM density fluctuation spectrum and hence fluctuations over a wide range\nof mass scales will become non-linear at similar redshifts.\nHence we calculate the excluded region in the fsurv -fc\nplane in Fig. 3, by requiring that the predicted flux does\nnot exceed any of the observed EGRB data.\n3. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nThe observability of the nearest microhalo from the\nEarth is of great interest. The expected photon flux is\ngiven by:\nY\u03b3 Mmh \u03c1eff h\u03c3\u03c7\u03c7 \u03c5i\n(4)\nF\u223c\n4\u03c0 [n(R\u2299 )]\u22122/3 2m2\u03c7\n2/3\n\u22122 \u22121\n= 1.5 \u00d7 10\u221211 fsurv\n(fc /6.2)Y40 m\u22122\ns , (5)\n2 cm\nwhere m2 = m\u03c7 / (100 GeV) and Y\u03b3 \u2261 40Y40 is the\nphoton number yield from one annihilation; typically\none annihilation produces 30\u201350 continuum gammarays and more than 80% of them are above 100 MeV\n(Gondolo et al. 2004). Unfortunately this flux is much\nsmaller than the point source sensitivity of the EGRET,\nand even of the future GLAST mission, and hence detection of individual microhaloes is unlikely. It is impossible to greatly enhance the detectability by boosting up\nthe internal density factor fc , because it would seriously\noverpredict the background flux far beyond the observed\nlevel.\nThe detectability of gamma-rays from microhaloes\nin the nearby extragalactic objects is also intriguing. Here we estimate the flux expected from M31,\nd = 770 kpc from the Earth.\nThe dark matter\nmass enclosed within 13 kpc, corresponding to the\nposition accuracy of EGRET (\u223c 1\u25e6 ), is MDM \u223c\n1.5 \u00d7 1011 M\u2299 (Klypin et al. 2002).\nThen we expect photon flux of Y\u03b3 \u1e44\u03c7\u03c7 MDM /(4\u03c0d2 ) \u223c 7.7 \u00d7\n10\u22129 fsurv (fc /6.2)Y40 m\u22122\ncm\u22122 s\u22121 , which is interest2\ningly very close to the EGRET upper bound (1.6 \u00d7 10\u22128,\nBlom et al. 1999), indicating that there is a good chance\nof detecting annihilation flux from microhaloes in M31\nby the GLAST mission or next generation air Cerenkov\n\n\f4\n\nODA ET AL.\n\nFig. 1.- The background gamma-ray flux from neutralino annihilation in the microhaloes. The Galactic (dashed), extragalactic (dotdashed), and the total (solid) components are shown. The two cases of m\u03c7 = 100 GeV and 1 TeV are presented, with fsurv = 0.35 and\n1, respectively. The internal density profile parameter fc = 6.2 is conservatively assumed. The baryon compressed NFW profile for the\nGalactic halo and Rd = 5 kpc are used for the Galactic component.\n\ntelescopes (ACTs), with a larger m\u03c7 favoring the latter.\nIn contrast to the flux from the center of cuspy density\nprofile, we expect rather diffuse flux distribution around\nthe center of M31, because microhaloes that are very\nclose to the M31 center are likely disrupted. The improved angular resolution of the GLAST or ACTs will\nbe able to resolve it.\nIn conclusion, annihilation gamma-rays from the microhaloes could be a significant component of the ob-\n\nserved EGRB flux. The two major uncertain parameters\nare fsurv and fc , and a considerable part of the parameter\nspace has already been excluded by the observed EGRB\nflux level.\nThis work was supported by the Grant-in-Aid for the\n21st Century COE \"Center for Diversity and Universality in Physics\" from the Ministry of Education, Culture,\nSports, Science and Technology (MEXT) of Japan.\n\nREFERENCES\nAndo, S. 2005, Phys.
