We use the amplitude for triangle quark loops of anomalous\ntype. In evaluating these loop integrals we use two methods. In the first one, we neglect the\ndependence of external momenta by reproducing the Wess-Zumino-Witten terms of effective chiral\nmeson Lagrangian. In the second method, we take into account the momentum dependence of loop\nintegrals omitting their imaginary part. This makes it possible to allow for quark confinement. As\napplied both the methods is in qualitative agreement with each other and with experimental data.\nThe second method allows us to describe the electron-positron annihilation with production of \u03b7 \u2032\nand \u03c1 mesons in the center of mass energy range from 1.6 to 3.5 GeV. The comparison with the\nrecent experimental data is presented.\n\nI.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nIn the local NJL model [1], [2], [3] meson interactions are described in terms of quark loops. If one neglects the\ndependence of external momenta in the corresponding integrals, the result will not violate chiral symmetry. In this way\nwe can reproduce effective chiral Lagrangian corresponding to U (3) \u00d7 U (3) symmetry [4], [2], [5]. In this lagrangian\nstrong interaction vertices are expressed in terms of logarithmically divergent parts of corresponding loop amplitudes.\nRadiative interactions of mesons are described in terms of quark Feynman diagrams of anomalous type which do not\ncontain ultraviolet divergencies. We use these anomalous quark loops for description of radiative mesons decays.\nHowever for production of pseudoscalar and vector mesons in electron-positron collisions we should keep the external\nmomentum dependence of the amplitudes. In this case, we encounter a serious problem of providing quark confinement\ncondition. To solve this problem, one usually uses a nonlocal version of the NJL model, which involves the relevant\nformfactors for description of the interaction between mesons and quarks. The choice of formfactors leads to the\nfunctional unambiguity. Among the different ways to introduce these formfactors we should mention the QCD\napproach [6] and the formfactors which arises from the instanton model [7]. It is necessary to mention the models\nsuggested by G. Efimov [8], Yu. Simonov [9], Roberts and so on.\nIt should be noted that a different form of formfactors leads to a different behavior of amplitudes in the physical\nregion. This becomes essential at large values of external momenta. It is the reason why we apply rather a simple\nand rough method which consists in exact calculation of amplitudes and neglection of their imaginary parts to avoid\nthe production of free quarks. As a result, we obtain a rather satisfactory description of radiative decay widths\nof vector and pseudoscalar mesons. This fact allows us to hope that this approach can be applied to describe the\nprocesses e\u0113 \u2192 \u03b7 \u2032 \u03c1, e\u0113 \u2192 \u03b7 \u2032 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 which can be measured in a series of existing and planned experiments with colliding\nelectron-positron beams [10], [11], [12], [13].\nFor the problems of the last type we hope to obtain only qualitative results in the center of mass energy range\n1 \u2212 3 GeV. In our approach we do not introduce any quark-meson formfactors.\nDescribing the decays of light mesons we ignore the dependence of corresponding loop integrals of external momenta\n\u2013 Approximation I. The problem of confinement in that approximation is automatically solved. In the case of heavy\nmesons we keep exact external momentum dependence of relevant loop amplitudes and neglect a possible imaginary\npart \u2013 Approximation II. Approximation II is used further for description of processes at electron-positron colliders.\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\naddress:\naddress:\n\u2021 Electronic address:\n\u00a7 Electronic address:\n\u2020 Electronic\n\nbystr@theor.jinr.ru\nkuraev@theor.jinr.ru\nvolkov@theor.jinr.ru\nfyzimsec@savba.sk\n\n\f2\n\u03b3(p2 )\nk + p2\nk\nV (p1 )\nk \u2212 p3\nP (p3 )\nFIG. 1: The radiative decay amplitude (4).\n\nII.\n\nRADIATIVE DECAYS OF VECTOR AND PSEUDOSCALAR MESONS\n\nFor the description of interaction of mesons with quarks we use the NJL model lagrangian [2, 3]:\nh\n\u0011i\ng\u03c1 \u0010\nLint = q\u0304 eQ\u00c2 + (i\u03b35 ) (gu \u03bbu \u03b7u + gs \u03bbs \u03b7s ) +\n(1)\n\u03bb3 \u03c1\u03020 + \u03bbu \u03c9\u0302 + \u03bbs \u03c6\u0302 q,\n2\n\u0001\n \u0304 s\u0304 where u, d, s are the quark fields, Q = diag (2/3, \u22121/3, \u22121/3) is the quark charge matrix,\nwhere q\u0304 = \u016b, d,\np\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u0001 \u221a\n\u0001 \u221a\n2\u03bb0 + \u03bb8 / 3, \u03bbs = \u2212\u03bb0 + 2\u03bb8 / 3 where \u03bbi are the Gell-Mann matrices and \u03bb0 = 2/3 diag (1, 1, 1).\n\u03bbu =\ngu = mu /f\u03c0 , gs = ms /fs are the meson-quark coupling constants which are evaluated by Goldberger-Treiman relation\n(mu = 263 MeV, ms = 407 MeV are quark masses [14], and f\u03c0 = 92.4 MeV is the pion decay constant and fs = 1.3f\u03c0 ).\ng\u03c1 = 5.94 is the \u03c1 \u2192 2\u03c0 coupling constant.\nPhysical states of \u03b7 and \u03b7 \u2032 mesons are obtained after taking into account of singlet-octet mixing of \u03b7u and \u03b7s with\nthe angle \u03b8 = 51.3o [2, 15]:\n\u03b7 = \u2212\u03b7u sin \u03b8 + \u03b7s cos \u03b8,\n\u03b7 \u2032 = \u03b7u cos \u03b8 + \u03b7s sin \u03b8.\n\n(2)\n(3)\n\nWe will consider the following processes below: \u03c1(\u03c9) \u2192 \u03b7\u03b3, \u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 \u03c1(\u03c9)\u03b3, \u03c6 \u2192 \u03b7(\u03b7 \u2032 )\u03b3.\nThe vector meson decay\nV (p1 ) \u2192 \u03b3(p2 ) + P (p3 ),\nis described by the amplitude of one loop with quark (see Fig. 1):\nMV \u2192P \u03b3 =\n\ni\n2\n\n(2\u03c0)\n\ne gP gV CP V Mq J(p21 , 0, p23 )(e1 e2 p1 p2 ),\n\n(4)\n\nwhere (abcd) \u2261 \u03b5\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3\u03b4 a\u03b1 b\u03b2 c\u03b3 d\u03b4 , gV = g\u03c1 /2, gP = gu if light quarks go through the loop and gP = gs if strange\nquarks are involved; CP V is the flavour-color multiplier corresponding to quark-meson interaction, C\u03b7\u03c9 = 2 sin \u03b8,\nC\u03b7\u03c1 = 6 sin \u03b8, C\u03b7\u2032 \u03c9 = 2 cos \u03b8, C\u03b7\u2032 \u03c1 = 6 cos \u03b8, C\u03b7\u03c6 = 4 cos \u03b8, C\u03b7\u2032 \u03c6 = 4 sin \u03b8; Mq is the loop quark mass and\n!\nZ\ndk\n1\n2 2 2\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001 =\nJ(p1 , p2 , p3 ) = Re\ni\u03c0 2 Mq2 \u2212 k 2 \u2212 i0 Mq2 \u2212 (k + p2 )2 \u2212 i0 Mq2 \u2212 (k \u2212 p3 )2 \u2212 i0\n\u0012Z 1 Z 1\u2212x\n\u0013\n1\n= Re\n,\n(5)\ndx\ndy 2\nMq \u2212 xyp21 \u2212 yzp22 \u2212 xzp23 \u2212 i0\n0\n0\nwhere z = 1 \u2212 x \u2212 y.

In this paper, we have another situation:\nmeson loops are absent totaly and only quark loops of anomalous type give a contribution to the amplitude of the\nprocess.\nBoth the approaches (Approximation I and Approximation II) were considered. We show that the application of\nthe NJL model leads to rather satisfactory agreement with the modern experimental data for the radiative decays.\nThat allows us to use the Approximation II to calculate the cross sections of associative vector and pseudoscalar\nmesons production in the electron-positron annihilation channel in the lowest order of electromagnetic constant. In\nthe last case, the heavy virtual photon converts to the set of pseudoscalar and vector mesons. Two mechanisms\nmust be taken into account: first one with the intermediate virtual photon and the second one which contains the\nconversion of intermediate photon into vector meson. We give a comparison of our prediction for the process e\u0113 \u2192 \u03b7 \u2032 \u03c1\nwith the experimental data of the BABAR collaboration.

We should like to notice that\nfor the NJL model results precision is of an order of 20-30 %.\nOne of our important theoretical assumptions is the absence of the imaginary part of relevant amplitudes. The\nmechanism of elimination of the imaginary part is tightly connected with the confinement nature and is not considered\nhere. We carry out the elimination \"by hand\" (\"naive confinement\"). It is to be noted, however, that if the imaginary\npart is taken into account, the considerable disagreement with the experimental data will occur in decay case. For\ninstance, if the imaginary part of the amplitude is taken into account, the decay width of \u03c6 \u2192 \u03b7 \u2032 \u03b3 is \u0393th.\n\u03c6\u2192\u03b7 \u2032 \u03b3 =\n0.824 KeV while the experiment gives \u0393exp.\n=\n0.265\nKeV\n(see\nTable\nI).\n\u2032\n\u03c6\u2192\u03b7 \u03b3\nConcerning the singlet-octet angle mixing we use the additional interaction of the t'Hooft type in lagrangian in the\nNJL model [15], [22], [23]. This approach was widely used in literature [24], [25].\nLet us note however that the alternative solution of mixing angle problem was developed in [18], [19], [20], [21].\nIn this approach two mixing angles appear. The application of the both approach to describe the decays of the\npseudoscalar and vector mesons leads to the similar results.\nOur results for decays in Approximation I are in agreement with the ones obtained in [17] (compare Table I and\nTable 2 in [17]).\nV.\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\nThe authors thank O.
