Our calculations include both single atom and macroscopic interactions between the non-linear\nmedium and the laser field. We analyze the harmonic generation by such pulses and show that it\nis spatially separated from the ionization dynamics which produce a large dynamical blue shift of\nthe laser pulse. This means that small changes in the initial laser focusing conditions can lead to\nlarge differences in the laser frequency modulation, even though the generated harmonic spectrum\nremains essentially unchanged.\nPACS numbers:\n\nIn their pioneering experiments reported in [1],\nHentschel et al. demonstrated the generation of single\nattosecond XUV pulses by 7 fs, 750 nm laser pulses interacting with a neon gas. As a first application, these XUV\npulses were used to probe the sub-cycle time dependence\nof the laser electric field emerging from the neon gas. A\nsurprisingly large dynamical blue shift was observed in\nthis way, with a maximum value of approximately 35%\nof the laser frequency, a result which was not well reproduced by theory.\nIonization is intrinsic to all highly non-linear laser matter interactions. It contributes free electrons to the interaction medium which induces a temporal and spatial\nvariation in the refractive index during propagation. This\ncauses both self-phase modulation and defocusing of the\nfield [2]. The experimental results in [1] raise a number of\nquestions: i) Can such a large frequency modulation be\ncaused by ionization driven self-phase modulation? ii) If\nso, how is it consistent with the observed harmonic cutoff\nenergy around 90 eV, which indicates a relatively moderate interaction intensity around 5 \u00d7 1014 W/cm2 [3]?\nAnd iii) what is the role of the ionization dynamics in\ncreating conditions favorable for the formation of single\nattosecond pulses?\nIn this paper we answer these questions by analyzing\nthe temporal and spatial ionization dynamics of an intense few-cycle pulse as it propagates through a neon gas\ncell and generates harmonics [4], using parameters similar to those of the experiment in [1]. We show that in the\nbeginning of the gas cell a large laser frequency modulation builds up rapidly when the intensity is still high, and\nthen slows down toward the end of the cell because the\nintensity is reduced by defocusing. We find that, quite\ngenerally, the harmonic generation is spatially separated\nfrom the frequency modulation of the driving field since\nthe XUV radiation is built up predominantly in the sec-\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\naddress: gaarde@phys.lsu.edu\n\nond half of the medium. Furthermore, we show that the\nfrequency modulation is very sensitive to small changes in\nthe initial focusing conditions of the laser beam, whereas\nthe intensity of the beam after propagation and the harmonic spectrum is not. Therefore, even though the XUV\npulse is an ideal probe of the laser field after its interaction with the gas, the harmonic spectrum and in particular its cutoff energy are poor indicators of the magnitude\nof the ionization driven dynamics. Finally we show that\nthe ionization dynamics lead to a driving pulse at the end\nof the medium which has been spatially and temporally\nreshaped in a way that facilitates the generation of single\nattosecond XUV bursts.\nOur description of the intense-laser matter interaction\nincludes both the response of a single atom to the laser\npulse, and the collective response of the macroscopic gas\nto the focused laser beam. We solve the wave equation for\nthe driving and the generated fields by space marching\nthrough the gas, using the slowly evolving wave approximation (SEWA) [4]. At each plane in the propagation\ndirection z, we calculate the single atom dynamics by\nsolving the time dependent Schr\u00f6dinger equation. The\nnon-linear atomic response is then used as the source\nterms in the wave equation for marching to the next plane\nin z. This approach is described in detail in [5].\nFor the propagation of the linearly polarized driving\nfield E1 (t) we include two source terms due to the ionization of the medium [2]:\n\u2202Jp (t)\ne2 Ne (t)\nE1 (t)\n=\n\u2202t\nme\n\u2202Jabs (t)\n\u2202 \u03b3(t)Ne (t)Ip E1 (t)\n=\n,\n\u2202t\n\u2202t\n|E1 (t)|2\n\n(1)\n(2)\n\nwhere e and me are the electron charge and mass, Ne (t) is\nthe electron density, \u03b3(t) is the ionization rate, and Ip is\nthe atomic ionization potential. All the time-dependent\nquantities are also functions of the cylindrical coordinates\nr and z. The plasma oscillation term Jp (t) gives rise to\na spatial and temporal variation of the refractive index\n\n\f2\n\nFIG. 1: (Color online) (a) Time dependent ionization probability of a neon atom exposed to a 750 nm, 7 fs laser pulse with\na peak intensity of 1015 W/cm2 . Pvol (t) is shown with solid\nline, PADK is shown with dashed line. (b) Intensity dependent correction factor for three different pulses: 7 fs duration,\ncosine carrier (open circles), 5 fs duration, cosine carrier (open\ntriangles), 5 fs duration, sine carrier (filled circles).\n\nwhich causes defocusing and self-phase modulation. The\nabsorption term Jabs (t) describes the loss of energy from\nthe laser field due to the ionization of the medium. This\nterm is small for all the cases discussed in this paper. The\nsource term for the harmonic radiation is given by the\nnon-linear polarization field, which is proportional to the\nsingle atom time-dependent dipole moment, calculated\nusing the strong field approximation [8], and the density\nof neutral atoms.\nTo describe the short pulse ionization dynamics correctly it is crucial to accurately calculate Ne (t) and \u03b3(t)\nwith sub-cycle precision. Our calculation of Ne (t) originates in a numerical solution of the TDSE within the\nsingle active electron approximation [6]. We define the\nionization probability Pvol (t) from the probability density of the wave function outside of a small volume around\nthe ion core, which can be continuously evaluated during\nthe calculation. In Fig. 1(a) we show Pvol (t) (solid line)\nfor a 750 nm, 7 fs driving pulse with a peak intensity\nof 1015 W/cm2 . Because of its short duration, the ionization probability at the end of the pulse is only about\n15%.\nIdeally, we would directly couple our numerical solution of the TDSE to the solution of the wave equation\nand use Pvol (t) to describe the time dependent ionization. Currently, we do not have the computational apparatus to do so. We also cannot directly use instantaneous tunnel ionization rates proposed by Ammosov,\nDelone, and Krainov (ADK) [7] since these give rise to\nmuch larger ionization probabilities at high intensities\nthan the numerical TDSE solution. However, we find\nthat for a given peak intensity, the ionization probability\nPADK (t) calculated from ADK rates differs from Pvol (t)\nby only a constant factor \u03b2, as long as the intensity is below the (ADK) saturation intensity. We determine \u03b2 as\nthe ratio between Pvol (t) and PADK (t) at the end of the\nlaser pulse. The dashed line in Fig. 1(a) shows \u03b2PADK (t)\nwhich is in excellent agreement with Pvol (t).\nWe next calculate \u03b2(I0 ) by comparing PADK (t) and\n\nFIG. 2: (Color online) Spatiotemporal dynamics of frequency\nmodulation of 750 nm, 7 fs pulse propagating through 3 mm\nof neon gas. See text for details.\n\nPvol (t) for many different peak intensities, I0 . This function is shown in Fig. 1(b), open circles. We have calculated \u03b2(I0 ) for different pulse durations and find that\nit depends only weakly on the duration and the absolute phase of the driving pulse. Examples are shown\nin Fig. 1(b) for driving pulse durations of 5 fs and\ntwo different carrier envelope phases. Finally, we use\n\u03b2(I0 )PADK (t) to calculate the source terms Ne (t) and\n\u03b3(t) for each point in the non-linear medium, where I0\nis the peak intensity of the driving pulse at that point.\nThe insensitivity of \u03b2(I0 ) to the duration and phase of\nthe driving pulse ensures that this is justified even as the\npulse changes shape and phase during propagation.\nFig. 2 illustrates the spatial and temporal dynamics of\nthe frequency modulation experienced by a laser pulse\nduring propagation through a rapidly ionizing neon gas.\nAs in [1], the incoming laser pulse has a wavelength of\n750 nm and a duration of 7 fs. The laser beam has a confocal parameter of 4.2 cm and its focus is in the center of\na 3 mm long neon gas jet with a density of 5 \u00d7 1018 cm\u22123 .\nIn the absence of the non-linear medium the peak intensity in the focus would be 9 \u00d7 1014 W/cm2 .\nIn 2(a) we show the on-axis electric field of the laser\npulse after propagation through the neon gas. Its time\ndependent frequency, shown in (b), is calculated from the\nseparation between consecutive peaks and zeros of the\nelectric field in (a). The pulse exhibits a large frequency\nchirp with a shape characteristic of self phase modulation. The maximum blue shift which occurs near the\npeak of the pulse is very large, approximately 22%, although still smaller than the 35% shift that was reported\nin [1]. This will be discussed in more detail below.\nFig. 2(c) shows how this large blue shift is accumulated\nduring propagation. The dashed line (left axis) shows\nthe on-axis energy density and the solid line (right axis)\nshows the blue shift, as functions of the propagation dis-\n\n\f3\ntance z. At each point in z, the blue shift has been found\nas the maximum value of the instantaneous frequency as\nplotted in (b). At the beginning of the gas where the\nintensity is high, defocusing is very strong. The energy\ndensity is reduced by almost a factor of two by the end\nof the gas. This intensity variation in turn controls the\nbuild-up of the blue shift which accumulates rapidly in\nthe first half of the gas and saturates towards the end.\nThe solid line in Fig. 2(d) shows the radial variation\nof the blue shift at the end of the gas (left axis). The\nblue shift is largest on axis and decreases as a function\nof r. The dashed and dot-dashed lines (right axis) show\nthe radial variation of the laser intensity at the beginning and at the end of the medium, respectively. The\nradial variation of the blue shift closely follows that of\nthe incoming laser field, in agreement with the result in\n(c) that the blue shift is predominantly generated at the\nbeginning of the gas. Experimentally, the laser field is\nprobed by the XUV pulse after refocusing both beams in\nto a second gas jet by a mirror placed several meters from\nthe first jet [1]. The XUV beam in the second medium\nis much smaller than the laser beam and therefore only\nprobes its on-axis frequency modulation [9]. In principle,\nthe radial variation of the dynamical blue shift could be\nprobed by slightly misaligning the two beams.\nThe ionization driven dynamics of the laser pulse has\nimportant consequences for the harmonic generation, and\ntherefore for the formation of attosecond XUV pulses as\nthese are synthesized from a range of harmonics near the\ncutoff [1]. Fig. 3 shows the radially integrated harmonic\nspectrum at the end of the neon gas. As a result of the\nfrequency shift of the laser pulse, the harmonic structures in the spectrum are not at odd multiples of the\nincoming laser frequency. As a result of the defocusing\nof the laser beam, the harmonic spectrum exhibits two\ndifferent cutoffs. The high energy cutoff around 170 eV is\ndetermined by the peak intensity of the incoming beam\n(\u2248 9 \u00d7 1014 W/cm2 ) [3], whereas the dominant low energy cutoff around 90 eV corresponds to the reduced peak\nintensity in the second half of the medium. In an experiment, it is likely that only the low energy cutoff would be\nobserved as the high energy cutoff is orders of magnitude\nweaker [10].\nThe insets show how the XUV radiation around 90 eV\n(left inset) and above 155 eV (right inset) build up during\npropagation. The highest energies are only generated\nover a short distance in the beginning of the medium\nand are then reabsorbed through the remainder of the\ngas. In contrast, the 90 eV photons are generated all\nthrough the medium. The saturation of this signal at\nthe end of the medium is due to phase matching. For\nlonger propagation lengths one would observe a periodic\nincrease and decrease of the yield. The total energy in a\n5 eV range around 90 eV is approximately 10 pJ.\nFig. 3 shows that the harmonic spectrum and its cutoff\nenergy are poor indicators of the propagation dynamics\nof the driving field. In a rapidly ionizing, long medium\nthe harmonic generation is spatially separated from the\n\nFIG. 3: (Color online) Radially integrated harmonic spectrum\nat end of the neon gas. The insets show the build-up along\nthe propagation direction of the XUV radiation around 90 eV\nand 155 eV (left and right inset, respectively).\n\ndefocusing and self-phase modulation experienced by the\nlaser field. In particular, both the yield and the photon energy of the spectral cutoff are essentially decoupled\nfrom the dynamical blue shift of the laser pulse.\nThis decoupling is further demonstrated in Fig. 4. We\nshow results of a calculation where the focusing conditions of the incoming laser beam have been slightly\nchanged compared to Fig. 2 while its energy has been\nkept constant. The new beam has a tighter focus with\na confocal parameter of 3 cm and a peak intensity of\n12.6 \u00d7 1014 W/cm2 . This corresponds to decreasing the\nbeam waist by less than 20%.\nFig. 4(a) compares the propagation dynamics of the\ntwo laser beams, showing the z-dependence of the on-axis\nenergy density and the on-axis maximum frequency\nshift, as in Fig. 2(c). The higher initial intensity gives\nrise to more free electrons, which in turn cause stronger\ndefocusing. This means that the two beams have almost\nidentical intensities at the end of the medium, and\ntherefore give rise to very similar harmonic spectra, as\nshown in Fig. 4(b). However, the peak dynamical blue\nshift of the more tightly focused beam is much higher\nthan before and reaches almost 35% by the end of the\nmedium. This answers the first two questions posed\nin the introduction: i) Ionization induced self phase\nmodulation can indeed induce a 35% frequency shift\nof the laser pulse in conditions very similar to those in\n[1], and ii) because of defocusing, the harmonic cutoff\nenergy is essentially decoupled from the magnitude of\nthe blue shift.\nTo answer question iii) about the influence of the ionization dynamics on the formation of attosecond pulses,\nFig. 5(a) shows the three dimensional spatiotemporal\nprofile of the intensity of the laser pulse at the end of the\nneon gas. We have used laser parameters as in Fig. 3, and\nthe absolute phase of the input electric field is given by a\ncosine driver.

In the nearfield,\nthe XUV time profile will therefore in general consist of\nseveral attosecond bursts. However, the off-axis XUV\nradiation is generated by a strongly divergent wavefront\nand is much less collimated than the on-axis XUV radiation. A spatial filter placed in the farfield can therefore\nalso act as a temporal filter, selecting only the single, collimated attosecond XUV burst generated on or close to\nthe axis [1, 12].\nTo demonstrate that the ionization dynamics play\na crucial role in producing the laser pulse shown in\nFig. 5(a), we show in Fig. 5(b) the nearfield profile of a\nlaser pulse with a lower initial intensity (5 \u00d7 1014 W/cm2\nand a confocal parameter of 6 cm). This pulse gives rise\nto the same spectral cutoff around 90 eV. The absence\nof spatiotemporal reshaping of this pulse makes it much\nless ideal for generation of single attosecond bursts: there\nis no shortening of the pulse on axis, and XUV bursts\ngenerated in consecutive half-cycles of the field will have\nsimilar divergence properties because of the smooth radial structure of the beam.\nIn summary, we have analyzed the propagation and\nharmonic generation dynamics of an intense few-cycle\nlaser pulse. We showed that the frequency modulation\ninduced by rapid ionization in the non-linear medium\ncan be very large, and can indeed reach a value of 35%\nin conditions very similar to those in [1]. We discussed\nthat whereas the frequency modulation is very sensitive\nto the laser focusing conditions, the harmonic spectrum\nis less so. Most importantly, we showed that the ionization driven spatiotemporal reshaping of the laser beam\nis very important in creating conditions favorable for the\ngeneration of isolated bursts of attosecond XUV pulses.\nThe authors are grateful to F.

The calculated frequency\nmodulation of the near-axis part of the laser beam after reflection on such a mirror is almost indistinguishable\nfrom the on-axis behavior as shown in Fig. 2(b).\n[10] A decrease of the cutoff energy as a result of defocusing\nhas been studied in detail previously, see for instance K.\nMiyazaki and H.
