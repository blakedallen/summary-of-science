Introduction\nThe simplest dynamics beyond periodic behavior can be found in\nsystems at the accumulation of period doubling. These systems have\na period doubling Cantor set whose dynamics can be very well understood in terms of the periodic orbits which accumulate on this set.\nThe consecutive approximating periodic orbits are related by so-called\nperiod doubling bifurcations. This simplest non-period behavior is often observed in models and in nature. In particular, the transition to\nchaos in strongly dissipative systems often occurs with such a period\ndoubling Cantor set.\nDate: June 24, 2018.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nD. GAIDASHEV, T. JOHNSON , M. MARTENS\n\nThe topological properties of these period doubling Cantor sets are\nsimple and very well understood. In the mid-1970's Feigenbaum [F1,\nF2] and, independently, Coullet and Tresser [CT, TC], discovered universal geometrical properties of these Cantor sets at the transition to\nchaotic behavior in one-dimensional dynamics. Coullet and Tresser\nconjectured that the universal geometry at transition to chaos in onedimensional dynamics will also be observed in higher dimensional systems. This conjecture has been confirmed by many numerical and\nphysical experiments.1\nFeigenbaum-Coullet-Tresser introduced renormalization in dynamics\nto explain the observed geometrical universality. The renormalization\noperator acts as a microscope. By repeatedly applying, one can describe the small scale geometrical structure by renormalizations, e.g.\nsystems associated to the smaller scales. The corresponding renormalization operator has a unique hyperbolic fixed point. The dynamics of\nthe renormalization fixed point, which is itself a one-dimensional system, and the behavior of the renormalization operator around this fixed\npoint determine the asymptotic small scale properties. This explains\nthe observed universality.\nThe renormalization technique has been generalized to many types\nof dynamics. However, a rigorous study of universality has been surprisingly difficult and technically sophisticated and so far has only been\nthoroughly carried out in the case of one-dimensional maps, on the interval or the circle, see [AL, FMP, He, L, Ma, McM, MS, S, VSK, Y].\nThere is, however, at present no deep understanding of universality in\nconservative systems, other than in the case of the universality for systems \"near integrability\" [AK, AKW, EKW2, K1, K2, K3, G1, Ko, Kh].\nConvergence of renormalization implies universal geometry at asymptotic small scale around a certain point. A stronger property is\nrigidity: there is universal geometry at asymptotic small scale around\nall points. All period doubling Cantor sets are topologically equivalent.\nBetween two of them there will be a homeomorphism conjugating the\ndynamics. A priori there is no reason to belief that these homeomorphisms have some smoothness. Rigidity means that there are conjugating homeomorphism which are smooth. The topology determines\nthe small scale geometry.\nIndeed, the period doubling Cantor sets in one-dimensional dynamics\nare rigid. This is surprising. Especially because the Cantor sets have\n1\n\nThis conjecture should be taken with caution as not every transition to chaos\nis related to accumulation of period doubling.\n\n\fRENORMALIZATIONOF AREA-PRESERVING MAPS\n\n3\n\nvery rich geometry: there are essentially no two points with the same\nasymptotic small scale geometry, see [BMT]. Many numerical and\nphysical experiments show that exactly the same universal geometry\nfrom one-dimensional dynamics occurs also in some dissipative higher\ndimensional systems. Surprisingly, the rigidity phenomenon is more\ndelicate in higher dimensions.\nStrongly dissipative two-dimensional H\u00e9non-like maps can be thought\nof as two dimensional perturbations of one-dimensional systems. In\n[CEK1] and [CLM] two renormalization schemes were developed for\nstrongly dissipative H\u00e9non-like maps at the accumulation of period\ndoubling. This explained the observed one-dimensional universal geometry present in these H\u00e9non-like maps. Surprisingly, the period doubling H\u00e9non-like Cantor sets are not smoothly conjugated to their onedimensional counter part, see [CLM, LM1].\nThe average Jacobian, e.g. the average rate of dissipation, plays a\nrole. The Cantor set of systems with different average Jacobian are not\nsmoothly conjugated, see [CLM, LM1]. Nevertheless, the geometry of\nthe one-dimensional period doubling Cantor set is still present. The\nconjugations between the Cantor sets of strongly dissipative H\u00e9non-like\nmaps is almost everywhere, with respect to the natural measure on the\nCantor set, smooth. This phenomenon is called Probabilistic Rigidity,\nsee [LM1, LM3]. Small scale geometry has a probabilistic nature in\nhigher dimensions.\nAs we discussed before, different average Jacobians are an obstruction to rigidity. However, this is not contradicting the rigidity paradigm\ntopology determines geometry. Namely, in [LM2] it is shown that maps\nwith different average Jacobian are not topologically equivalent. The\naverage Jacobian is a topological invariant. It describes topological aspects of the heteroclinic web, e.g. the network of stable and unstable\nmanifolds of the period orbits. This leads to the\n\nJacobian Rigidity Conjecture. The period doubling Cantor sets of\ntwo-dimensional H\u00e9non-like maps with the same average Jacobian are\nsmoothly conjugated.\n\nThis conjecture is true for average Jacobian zero, e.g. the onedimensional case. The other extreme case when the maps preserve\narea, e.g. the average Jacobian is one, is described in Theorem 4.1. It\nsays,\n\n\f4\n\nD. GAIDASHEV, T. JOHNSON , M. MARTENS\n\nRigidity for Area-preserving Maps. The period doubling Cantor\nset of area-preserving maps in the universality class of the EckmanKoch-Wittwer renormalization fixed point are smoothly conjugated.\nArea-preserving maps at accumulation of period doubling are observed by several authors in the early 80's, see [DP, Hl, BCGG, Bo,\nCEK2, EKW1]. In [EKW2] Eckmann, Koch and Wittwer introduced a\nperiod doubling renormalization scheme for area preserving maps and\ndescribed the hyperbolic behavior of the renormalization operator in\na neighborhood of a renormalization fixed point. In particular, they\nobserved universality for maps at the accumulation of period doubling.\nThe maps in the universality class of the Eckmann-Koch-Wittwer\nrenormalization fixed point are at the accumulation of period doubling.\nIt was shown in [GJ1] that these maps do have a period doubling\nCantor set and the Lyapounov exponents are at most zero. Moreover,\nfor maps in a certain strong stable part of the renormalization fixed\npoint, a space with finite codimension, their period doubling Cantor\nsets are at least bi-Lipschitz conjugated. In this paper we improve\nthe conclusions of [GJ1]: rigidity holds in the whole stable manifold\nof the Eckmann-Koch-Wittwer renormalization fixed point. Moreover,\nthe conjugations are at least C 1+\u03b1 with \u03b1 = 0.237.\nAcknoledgements: This work was started during a visit by the authors to the Institut Mittag-Leffler (Djursholm, Sweden) as part of the\nresearch program on \"Dynamics and PDEs\".

We will need stronger and additional estimates than\nthe spectral information obtained in [EKW2]. These estimates were\nobtained in [GJ2]. Although both [EKW2] and [GJ2] study a neighborhood of the same fixed point, the used constructions differ. We do\nneed the estimates form [GJ2] and summerize these results here.\nIn [GJ2] Gaidashev and Johnson construct simply connected domains D \u2282 D \u2282 C2 and adapt the renormalization scheme from\n[EKW2]. This renormalization scheme is defined on a neighborhood\nCons0 (D) of F\u2217 \u2208 Cons(D), where F\u2217 corresponds to the EckmanKoch-Wittwer fixed point. Each map F \u2208 Cons0 (D) has a unique periodic orbit of period 2. This orbit has one point (pF , 0) with pF < 0.\nThe dependance\nF 7\u2192 pF\nis analytic.

The rigidity Theorem can be proved\nunder the condition\n\u03b82\u2217 \u03c3 \u2217\n< 1.\n\u03b81\u2217\nThe derivative of renormalization at the fixed point is a compact operator. In particular, rigidity can be proved on a finite codimension\nsubspace where the contraction is strong enough. The numerical estimates from [GJ2] show that only the weakest stable direction is not\nstrong enough. Luckily, this weakest stable direction corresponds to a\none-dimensional family of analytically conjugated maps. The authors\ndo not have a conceptual explanation for this coincidence.\n\n\f8\n\nD. GAIDASHEV, T. JOHNSON , M. MARTENS\n\nThe Appendix is used to present some elementary estimates on the\nerror term of affine approximations of diffeomorphisms. In this section\nwe used coordinates (x, u) to denote a point. In the sequel we will not\nneed anymore the coordinates and denote points simply by x, etc.\n3. The Cantor Set\nIn this section we construct the invariant Cantor set for infinitely\nrenormalizable maps. This cantor set is intrinsically related to the\nrenormalization process. As in dimension one, it is a Cantor set on\nwhich the map acts like the dyadic adding machine. The construction\nis similar to the construction of the limit set of an iterated function\nsystem. As a matter of fact, the Cantor set of the renormalization fixed\npoint F\u2217 , is the limit set of an iterated function system, see Figure 3.1.\nThe stable manifold W s (F\u2217 ) \u2282 Cons0 (D), also called the universality\nclass, of F\u2217 , consists of the maps with Rn F \u2192 F\u2217 . Trough out this\nsection we will consider a fixed map F \u2208 W s (F\u2217 ).\nWe will use the notation\n\u03c80n = \u039bRn\u22121 F : D \u2192 R2\nand\n\u03c81n = Rn\u22121 F \u25e6 \u039bRn\u22121 F : D \u2192 R2\nObserve,\nRn F = (\u03c80n )\u22121 \u25e6 Rn\u22121 F \u25e6 \u03c80n .\nThe convergence of Rn F \u2192 F\u2217 and Theorem 2.1(8) immediately implies\nLemma 3.1. For every F \u2208 W s (F\u2217 )\nn\nlim ||\u03c80,1\n(F ) \u2212 \u03c80,1 (F\u2217 )||C 2 = 0.\n\nn\u2192\u221e\n\nRemark 3.1. Lemma 3.1 shows a crucial difference between conservative\nand dissipative infinitely renormalizable maps. In the conservative case,\nthe rescaling maps converge to (non-degenerated) diffeomorphisms. In\nthe dissipative case, the corresponding rescaling \u03c81n converge to a degenerated map, a map with one-dimensional image. This degeneration\nis at the heart of the difficulties of the non-rigidity phenomena observed\nin dissipative maps, see [CLM]. The degeneration occurs in a universal\nmanner. This universal degeneration is responsible for the probabilistic\nnature of geometry in dimension two where one observes Probabilistic\nUniversality and Probabilistic Rigidity, see [LM3].\nRemark 3.2. The convergence in Lemma 3.1 holds in any C k -distance,\nk \u2265 0. We only need control of the lower order derivatives.\n\n\fRENORMALIZATIONOF AREA-PRESERVING MAPS\n\n9\n\nRemark 3.3. The construction of the Cantor set in the conservative\ncase is exactly the same as in the dissipative case. The difference lies\nin the asymptotic behavior of the rescalings, see remark 3.1.\nLet\n\u03a8200 = \u03c801 \u25e6 \u03c802 ,\n\n\u03a8201 = \u03c801 \u25e6 \u03c812 ,\n\n\u03a8210 = \u03c811 \u25e6 \u03c802 ,\n\n....\n\nand, proceeding this way, construct, for any w = (w1 , . . . , wn ) \u2208 {0, 1}n ,\nn \u2265 1, the maps\n\u03a8nw = \u03c8w1 1 \u25e6 * * * \u25e6 \u03c8wn n : Dom(Rn F ) \u2192 Dom(F ).\nThe notation \u03a8nw (F ) will also be used to emphasize the map under\nconsideration. The following Lemma follows directly from Proposition\n2.3.\nLemma 3.2.

If p(w) = 0n+1 , then F (Bwn ) \u2229 B0nn+1 6= \u2205.\nProof. The first assertion holds by construction: Let w \u2208 {0, 1}n\u22121,\nwn , v \u2208 {0, 1}, and use Lemma 2.2,\nn\u22121\nn\n\u25e6 \u03c8wn n (Bv (Rn F ))\nBww\n= \u03a8nwwn (Bv (Rn F )) = \u03a8w\nnv\nn\u22121\nn\u22121\n(Bwn (Rn\u22121 F )) = Bww\n\u2282 \u03a8w\n(F ).\nn\n\nThe second follows by induction. For all maps under consideration\nwe have the disjointness property (2.1) which says, that B01 (F ) and\nB11 (F ) are disjoint. Assume that the pieces of the nth generation are\ndisjoint for all maps under consideration. This implies that the pieces\nn+1\nB0w\n\u2282 B01 , w \u2208 {0, 1}n+1, are pairwise disjoint, as they are images of\nthe disjoint pieces Bwn (RF ) by the map \u03c810 . Applying F , we see that\nn+1\n\u2282 B11 , w \u2208 W n , are pairwise disjoint as well. The\nthe pieces B1w\nassertion follows because B11 and B01 are also disjoint.\nLet us inductively check the third assertion. For n = 1, we have:\nB11 = F (B01 ) and F (B11 ) \u2229 B01 6= \u2205.\nConsider now the pieces Bwn (RF ), w \u2208 {0, 1}n+1, of level n for RF .\nAssume inductively that they are permuted by RF as required. Then\nn+1\nthe pieces B0w\n= \u03c801 (Bwn (RF )) are permuted in the same fashion under\nn+1\nn+1\n2\nF . Moreover, B1w\n= \u03c811 (Bwn (RF )) = F (B0w\n), and the conclusion\nfollows.\n\u0003\nFurthermore, Lemma 3.2 implies:\nLemma 3.4. For every F \u2208 W s (F\u2217 ) there exists C > 0 such that for\nall w \u2208 {0, 1}n+1, diam Bwn \u2264 C\u03b82n .\nLet\nO \u2261 OF =\n\n\u221e\n\\\n\n[\n\nBwn .\n\nn=1 w\u2208{0,1}n\n\nLet us also consider the diadic group {0, 1}\u221e = lim{0, 1}n .

The adding\nmachine p : {0, 1}\u221e \u2192 {0, 1}\u221e is the operation of adding 1 in this\ngroup. The discussion above yields:\nTheorem 3.5. For every F \u2208 W s (F\u2217 ) the set OF is an invariant\nCantor set. The map F acts on OF as the dyadic adding machine\np : {0, 1}\u221e \u2192 {0, 1}\u221e.

The dynamics of F restricted\nto OF is conjugated to the adding machine. The adding machine is\nuniquely ergodic. Let \u03bc be the unique invariant measure of F restricted\nto OF :\n1\n\u03bc(Bwn ) = n+1 .\n2\nTheorem 3.6. The measure \u03bcF of every map F \u2208 W s (F\u2217 ) has a single\ncharacteristic exponent, \u03c7 = 0.\nProof. The largest characteristic exponent is denoted by \u03c7.

Let \u03bcn be the normalized restriction of \u03bc to B0nn 0 \u222a B0nn 1 ,\nand let \u03bdn be the invariant measure on the Cantor set of Fn . Note that\nthese two measures are preserved by the conjugacy. Then\nZ\nn\n2n\nn\nn\n2 \u03c7 = \u03c7(F |B0n 0 \u222a B0n 1 , \u03bcn ) = \u03c7(Fn , \u03bdn ) \u2264 log kDFn k d\u03bdn \u2264 C,\nsince the maps Fn \u2192 F\u2217 have uniformly bounded C 1 -norms.\nHence, \u03c7 \u2264 0. If \u03c7 < 0, both characteristic exponents of F would be\nnegative. This contradicts the relation \u03c7 + \u03c7\u2212 = 0 which holds because\nthe map preserves the Lebesgue measure.\n\u0003\n\n\f12\n\nD. GAIDASHEV, T. JOHNSON , M. MARTENS\n\n4.

We use the\nuniform control of these maps at the 4nth -scale for the renormalizations\nand push it down to the next scale of the original systems. The control\nof the derivative of the quasi-conjugations, see Lemma 4.7, Lemma\n4.8, and Lemma 4.9 relies in an essential way on the fact that the\nrenormalizations R4 F and R4 F\u0303 of F and F\u0303 are strictly closer, see Theorem 2.1(6), than the original systems.

The proof of Lemma 4.8 and Lemma 4.9 rely on the strong\nss\nconvergence in Wloc\n(F\u2217 ). Namely,\n\u03b82 \u03bd\n< 1.\n\u03b81\nAlso observe that Lemma 4.7 is only useful under the same condition.\ns\nThe convergence in Wloc\n(F\u2217 ) is too slow to allow a similar treatment.\nThe Cantor sets OF are constructed similar to the limit set of an\nn\niterated function system. See Figure 3.1. The pieces Bwv\nare images of\nthe branches \u03a8nw . These branches are generated by the rescaling maps\n\u03c80n and \u03c81n which have the property \u03c80n \u2192 \u03c80 and \u03c81n \u2192 \u03c81 . One could\ngeneralize this construction by arbitrarily chosen converging sequences\nof contracting diffeomorphisms. In this generalized context one would\nalso obtain a rigidity theorem under the condition that the convergence\nis fast enough compared to the minimal and maximal contraction rates\nof the limit diffeomorphisms. However, one can construct examples of\n\n\f24\n\nD. GAIDASHEV, T. JOHNSON , M. MARTENS\n\nthis generalized type with slow convergence such that the conjugations\nare not Lipschitz.\nThe Rigidity Theorem 4.1 in the context of area-preserving maps\nrelies on the above mentioned general principle together with the fact\nthat the weak stable direction is a family containing the fixed point of\nanalytically conjugated maps, see Theorem 2.1(7).\nFrom Lemma 4.7 we get convergence lim Dhn (x) = D(x). The following Lemmas states that the matrices D(x) are indeed the derivatives of\nthe limit map h = lim hn : OF \u2192 OF\u0303 and that these derivatives satisfy\na Holder condition. They follow from Lemma 4.8 and Lemma 4.9 by\ntaking the limit.\nLemma 4.10. For every 0 < \u03b1 < \u03b10 there exists a constant C > 0\nsuch that\n|h(y) \u2212 h(x) \u2212 Dh(x)(y \u2212 x)| \u2264 C * d(F, F\u0303 ) * |y \u2212 x|1+\u03b1 ,\nwhere x, y \u2208 OF and Dh(x) = D(x).\nLemma 4.11. For every 0 < \u03b1 < \u03b10 there exists a constant C > 0\nsuch that\n|Dh(y) \u2212 Dh(x)| \u2264 C * d(F, F\u0303 ) * |y \u2212 x|\u03b1 ,\nwhere x, y \u2208 OF .\n\nProof of Proposituion 4.5: Lemma 4.10 and Lemma 4.11 say that the\nconjugation h : OF \u2192 OF\u0303 is a C 1+\u03b1 -map. By switching the role of F\nand F\u0303 we see that h is in fact a C 1+\u03b1 -diffeomorphism. The Proposition\nfollows.\n\u0003\nss\nProof of the Rigidity Theorem 4.1: Given F \u2208 W s (F\u2217 ), let F\u0303 \u2208 Wloc\n(F\u2217 )\nand n \u2265 1 be the map from Lemma 4.4. In particular, the conjugation\nh : ORn F \u2192 OF\u0303 is a C 1+Lip -diffeomorphism. Proposition 4.5 says,\n\nOF\u0303 = OF\u2217 mod(C 1+\u03b1 ).\nHence,\nORn F = OF\u2217 mod(C 1+\u03b1 ).\nApply Lemma 4.2 and the Rigidity Theorem 4.1 follows.\n\n\u0003\n\n\fRENORMALIZATIONOF AREA-PRESERVING MAPS\n\n25\n\n5.

Secondly, one can reduce the problem to a one-variable\nproblem by restricting these coordinate function to the lines connecting\ntwo points. For a one-variable function \u03c8 : (d1 , d2 ) \u2192 R we have\nZ y\nE\u03c8 (x, y) =\n\u03c8 (2) (t) * (y \u2212 t) * dt.\nx\n\nOne can use this to prove for example Lemma 5.2.
