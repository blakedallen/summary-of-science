Introduction\nLow-mass cosmic relic particles provide a hot-dark matter component of the universe.\nAfter they decouple in the early universe, they freely stream and decrease the spectral\npower of primordial density fluctuations on small scales. This well-studied effect has\nbeen established as a standard method to derive neutrino mass limits where the results of\ndifferent authors differ primarily in the used observational data sets and assumed priors\non some of the cosmological parameters (for a recent review see Ref. [1]). Two of us have\nrecently extended this method to several generic cases of other low-mass thermal relics\nthat may have been produced in the early universe [2], for example weakly interacting\nbosons such as the hypothetical axions.\nFor a generic low-mass particle species X that was once in thermal equilibrium, the\ncrucial parameters that enter the structure-formation argument are the assumed particle\nmass mX , the number gX of internal degrees of freedom, the relevant quantum statistics\n(boson vs. fermion), and finally the number g\u2217 of effective cosmic thermal degrees of\nfreedom at the epoch when the X particles thermally decouple. These parameters\nimply the present-day cosmic mass density \u03a9X in these particles as well as their velocity\ndistribution and primordial free-streaming scale.\nIn Ref. [2] two of us considered thermal relic axions as a specific example and found\nan upper mass limit of 2\u20133 eV. The main purpose of the present paper is to sharpen\nthis result in two ways. First, we use an updated set of observational data. Second, we\ntake a closer look at the axion freeze-out in the early universe to obtain a more accurate\nvalue for g\u2217 in terms of the appropriate coupling constants.\nWe begin in Sec. 2 with a brief summary of the relevant aspects of axion physics\nand continue in Sec. 3 with a determination of the freeze-out conditions as a function of\nthe relevant axion coupling constants. In Sec. 4 we perform a likelihood analysis based\non recent cosmological data to determine the allowed range of axion parameters. We\nfinish in Sec. 5 with a summary and interpretation of our results.\n2. Axions\nQuantum chromodynamics is a CP-violating theory, implying that the neutron should\nhave a large electric dipole moment, in conflict with the opposite experimental evidence.\nThe most elegant solution of this \"strong CP problem\" was proposed by Peccei and\nQuinn (PQ) who showed that CP conservation is dynamically restored in the presence\nof a new global U(1) symmetry that is spontaneously broken at some large energy\nscale [3, 4]. Weinberg [5] and Wilczek [6] realized that an inevitable consequence of the\nPQ mechanism is the existence of a new pseudoscalar boson, the axion, which is the\nNambu-Goldstone boson of the PQ symmetry. This symmetry is explicitly broken at\nlow energies by instanton effects so that the axion acquires a small mass. Unless there\n\n\fNew cosmological mass limit on thermal relic axions\n\n3\n\nare non-QCD contributions, perhaps from Planck-scale physics [7, 8], the mass is\nz 1/2 f\u03c0 m\u03c0\n6.0 eV\nma =\n=\n,\n1 + z fa\nfa /106 GeV\n\n(1)\n\nwhere the energy scale fa is the axion decay constant or PQ scale that governs all axion\nproperties, f\u03c0 = 93 MeV is the pion decay constant, and z = mu /md is the mass ratio\nof the up and down quarks. We will follow the previous axion literature and assume a\nvalue z = 0.56 [9, 10], but we note that it could vary in the range 0.3\u20130.7 [11].\nThe PQ scale is constrained by various experiments and astrophysical arguments\nthat involve processes where axions interact with photons, electrons, and hadrons. The\ninteraction strength with these particles scales as fa\u22121 , apart from model-dependent\nnumerical factors. If axions indeed exist, experimental and astrophysical limits suggest\n9\nthat fa >\n\u223c 0.01 eV [11, 12].\n\u223c 0.6 \u00d7 10 GeV and ma <\nPerhaps the most robust limits are those on the axion interaction strength with\nphotons and electrons because the properties of ordinary stars can be used to test\nanomalous energy losses caused by processes such as \u03b3 + e\u2212 \u2192 e\u2212 + a or the Primakoff\nprocess \u03b3 + Ze \u2192 Ze + a [11, 12]. These limits are so restrictive that processes involving\nthe electron and photon couplings will not be significant for the thermalization of axions\nin the early universe in the post-QCD epoch. On the other hand, these interactions are\nalso the most model dependent. Axion-models can be constructed where the axionphoton interaction is arbitrarily small. In \"hadronic axion models\" such as the KSVZ\nmodel [13, 14] there is no tree-level interaction with ordinary quarks and leptons, and\nin any case, the axion-electron coupling can be very small even in non-hadronic models\nsuch as the DFSZ model [15, 16]. Therefore, the restrictive stellar limits on the electron\nand photon couplings do not conclusively rule out axions with a PQ scale in the 106 GeV\nrange that is of interest to us.\nThe axion-nucleon interaction strength is constrained by two different limits based\non the observed neutrino signal of supernova 1987A [11, 12]. The axionic energy loss\ncaused by processes such as NN \u2192 NNa excludes a window of the axion-nucleon\ninteraction strength where the axionic contribution to the loss or transfer of energy\nwould have been comparable to or larger than that of neutrinos. For a sufficiently\nlarge interaction strength, axions no longer compete with neutrinos for the overall\nenergy transfer in the supernova core, but then would cause too many events in the\nwater Cherenkov detectors that observed the neutrino signal. However, there is a\nnarrow intermediate range of couplings, corresponding to fa around 106 GeV, i.e. to an\naxion mass of a few eV, where neither argument is conclusive. In this \"hadronic axion\nwindow,\" these elusive particles may still be allowed. This observation has previously\nled to the speculation that axions with eV-masses could contribute a significant hot\ndark-matter fraction to the universe [17].\n\n\fNew cosmological mass limit on thermal relic axions\n\n4\n\nAssuming that axions do not couple to charged leptons, the main thermalization\nprocesses in the post-QCD epoch involve hadrons [18]\na+\u03c0 \u2194 \u03c0+\u03c0,\n\n(2)\n\na+N \u2194 N +\u03c0.\n\n(3)\n\nDue to the scarcity of nucleons relative to pions, the pionic processes are actually by far\nthe most important. Therefore, we need the axion-pion interaction which is given by a\nLagrangian of the form [18]\n\u0011\nCa\u03c0 \u0010 0 +\n(4)\n\u03c0 \u03c0 \u2202\u03bc \u03c0 \u2212 + \u03c0 0 \u03c0 \u2212 \u2202\u03bc \u03c0 + \u2212 2\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u2202\u03bc \u03c0 0 \u2202\u03bc a .\nf\u03c0 fa\nIn hadronic axion models where the ordinary quarks and leptons do not carry PQ\ncharges, the coupling constant is [18]\n1\u2212z\nCa\u03c0 =\n.\n(5)\n3 (1 + z)\n\nLa\u03c0 =\n\nIn non-hadronic models an additional term enters that could, in principle, reduce Ca\u03c0 .\nFor the DFSZ model, the relevant a-\u03c0 0 -mixing strength was derived by Carena and\nPeccei [19]. In the DFSZ model, however, axions in our fa range are already excluded\nso that we mainly focus on hadronic models.\n3. Axion decoupling\n3.1. Pionic process\nAxions are an often-cited cold dark matter candidate if they interact so weakly (if fa\nis so large) that they never achieve thermal equilibrium [23\u201327]. In that case coherent\noscillations of the axion field are excited around the QCD transition when the PQ\nsymmetry is explicitly broken by instanton effects. However, if fa is sufficiently small\nso that axions interact sufficiently strongly, they will thermalize and survive as thermal\nrelics in analogy to neutrinos [18, 20, 21]. In the eV-range of axion masses that is of\ninterest to us, thermalization will happen after the QCD transition so that one has\nto consider axion interactions with hadrons rather than interactions with quarks and\ngluons that would be relevant at earlier epochs.\nAxions freeze out when their rate of interaction becomes slow compared to the\ncosmic expansion rate. As a criterion for axion thermal decoupling we use\nh\u0393a iT = H(T ) ,\n\n(6)\n\nwhere h\u0393a iT is the axion absorption rate, averaged over a thermal distribution at\ntemperature T , whereas H(T ) is the Hubble expansion parameter at the cosmic\ntemperature T . Our freeze-out criterion is accurate up to a constant of order unity.\nIn principle, the full system of Boltzmann equations should be followed for all species,\nbut the use of H(T ) = h\u0393a iT only introduces an error of 10\u201320% in the decoupling\ntemperature, consistent with the other approximations we will use.\n\n\f5\n\nNew cosmological mass limit on thermal relic axions\n\nAs explained in Sec. 2, by far the most important process for axion thermalization\nis the pionic reaction of Eq. (2) which is of the form 1 + 2 \u2192 3 + 4 with particle 1 the\naxion and particles 2\u20134 the pions. The average absorption rate is\nh\u0393a iT =\n\n1\nna\n\nZ\n\nd3 p1\nd3 p2\nd3 p3\nd3 p4 X\n|M|2\n(2\u03c0)3 2E1 (2\u03c0)3 2E2 (2\u03c0)3 2E3 (2\u03c0)3 2E4\n\u00d7 (2\u03c0)4 \u03b4 4 (p1 + p2 \u2212 p3 \u2212 p4 ) f1 f2 (1 + f3 )(1 + f4 ) ,\n\n(7)\n\nwhere fj are the thermal occupation numbers. The axion number density in thermal\nR\nequilibrium is na = d3 p1 f1 /(2\u03c0)3 = (\u03b63 /\u03c0 2 ) T 3 .\nThe interaction Eq. (4) implies the three pionic processes a + \u03c0 0 \u2192 \u03c0 + + \u03c0 \u2212 ,\na+\u03c0 + \u2192 \u03c0 + +\u03c0 0, and a+\u03c0 \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 \u2212 +\u03c0 0 . Assuming equal mass m\u03c0 for both charged and\nneutral pions, we find for the squared matrix element, summed over all three channels,\nX\n\n9\n|M| =\n4\n2\n\nCa\u03c0\nfa f\u03c0\n\n!2\n\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\ns2 + t2 + u2 \u2212 3m4\u03c0 ,\n\n(8)\n\nwhere s = (p1 + p2 )2 , t = (p1 \u2212 p3 )2 , and u = (p1 \u2212 p4 )2 .\nWe have performed the phase-space integration in Eq. (7) along the lines of the\nmethod described in Ref. [22]. Chang and Choi [18] give an explicit three-dimensional\nintegral expression for the average rate of \u03c0\u03c0 \u2192 \u03c0a when the final-state stimulation\nfactors (1 + f3 )(1 + f4 ) are neglected. Our numerical integration agrees with their result\nif we consider the same quantity, but in the following we use our full expression for the\naverage absorption rate.

Expansion rate\nThe cosmic expansion rate is given by the Friedmann equation as H 2 = 8\u03c0GN \u03c1/3 with\nGN the Newton constant and \u03c1 the mass-energy density. For the radiation dominated\nepoch one usually writes [28]\nX\n\u03c02\ng\u2217 (T ) T 4 =\ngj\n\u03c1=\n30\nj=particles\n\nZ\n\n(m2j + p2 )1/2\nd3 p\ni\nh\n(2\u03c0)3 exp (m2j + p2 )1/2 /T \u00b1 1\n\n(10)\n\nwhere g\u2217 (T ) denotes the effective number of thermal degrees of freedom that are excited\nat the epoch with temperature T . Further, gj is the number of internal degrees of\nfreedom of a given particle species j with mass mj . The \u00b11 in the denominator applies\nto bosons and fermions, respectively. We assume vanishing chemical potentials for all\nparticles. For the conditions of interest, the particle-antiparticle asymmetry is small\neven for nucleons. The Friedmann equation is thus\n4\u03c0 3\ng\u2217 (T )\nH=\n45\n\"\n\n#1/2\n\nT2\n,\nmPl\n\n(11)\n\n\u22121/2\n\nwhere mPl = GN is the Planck mass.\nWe consider all particles with masses up to the nucleon mass as listed in Table 1. In\nthe upper panel of Fig. 2 we show the function g\u2217 (T ), assuming that only the particles of\nTable 1 contribute and ignoring the color deconfinement transition that probably takes\nplace at a temperature somewhat below 200 MeV.\nTable 1.

However, if axions\nfreeze out at a certain epoch, their number density at late times is governed by g\u2217S , the\neffective number of thermal degrees characterizing the entropy at the freeze-out epoch.\nThe entropy density of an ideal gas is given by the general expression (\u03c1+P )/T \u221d g\u2217S T 3\nwith P the pressure. The pressure is given by the same integral expression as the energy\ndensity in Eq. (10) after replacing Ej = (m2j + p2 )1/2 by 31 p * v = 13 p2 /Ej . Even though\n\n\fNew cosmological mass limit on thermal relic axions\n\n7\n\nFigure 2. Effective number of thermal degrees of freedom in the early universe during\nthe post-QCD epoch, assuming the particle content listed in Table 1. Upper panel: g\u2217 .\nLower Panel: g\u2217S /g\u2217 .\n\nwe assume that all particles are in thermal equilibrium at the same temperature, there\nwill be a difference between g\u2217 and g\u2217S because some of the contributing particles are not\nmassless. In the lower panel of Fig. 2 we show the ratio g\u2217S /g\u2217 . Since the deviation of g\u2217\nfrom g\u2217S is at most a few percent for the conditions of interest, we will henceforth ignore\nthe difference between the two quantities and always use g\u2217 . Moreover, since axions\nthemselves contribute only a single degree of freedom we neglect their contribution to\ng\u2217 for simplicity.\n3.3. Freeze-out conditions\nWe now combine our result for the cosmic expansion rate in the post-QCD epoch\nwith that for the axion absorption rate and determine the freeze-out conditions from\nEq. (6). As an example we show H(T ) and h\u0393a iT in Fig. 3, assuming a PQ scale of\n\n\fNew cosmological mass limit on thermal relic axions\n\n8\n\nfa = 107 GeV and the hadronic axion-pion coupling of Eq. (5). From the intersection\npoint we determine TD , the axion decoupling temperature, and the corresponding g\u2217 .\nWe show these quantities as functions of fa in Fig. 4 and in Table 2.\nMoreover, from g\u2217 at decoupling one can determine the present-day number density\nof axions by virtue of the relation\nna =\n\nn\u03b3\ng\u2217S (today)\n\u00d7\n,\ng\u2217S (decoupling)\n2\n\n(12)\n\nwhere n\u03b3 = 411 cm\u22123 [11] is the present-day density of cosmic microwave photons\nand today g\u2217S = 3.91 [28]. We show na as a function of fa in Fig. 4 and give some\nnumerical values in Table 2. For comparison, we note that the present-day neutrino\nnumber density, determined by standard neutrino freeze-out, is n\u03bd \u2243 112 cm\u22123 .\n\nFigure 3.

Theoretical predictions\nIn order to derive limits on the axion parameters we compare theoretical power spectra\nfor the matter distribution and the CMB temperature fluctuations with observational\ndata in analogy to previous works by one of us [29\u201331]. The predicted power spectra\nare calculated with the publicly available CMBFAST package [32]. As in our previous\npaper on general low-mass thermal relics [2] we have modified the code to include a\nscalar boson that decouples earlier than neutrinos, i.e. we assume a number density and\nvelocity distribution according to the freeze-out epoch.\nAs a set of cosmological parameters apart from the axion characteristics we\nchoose the matter density \u03a9M , the baryon density \u03a9B , the Hubble parameter H0 ,\nthe scalar spectral index of the primordial fluctuation spectrum ns , the optical depth\nto reionization \u03c4 , the normalization of the CMB power spectrum Q, and the bias\nparameter b. We restrict our analysis to geometrically flat models \u03a9 = \u03a9M + \u03a9\u039b = 1.\nThe cosmological parameters and their assumed priors are listed in Table 3. The\nactual marginalization over parameters was performed using a simulated annealing\nprocedure [33]. The cosmological parameters in our model corresponds to the simplest\n\u039bCDM model which fits present data. While our results would be changed slightly by\nincluding additional parameters, there would be no significant changes [2].\nLikelihoods are calculated from \u03c72 so that for 1 parameter estimates, 68% confidence\nregions are determined by \u2206\u03c72 = \u03c72 \u2212 \u03c720 = 1, and 95% regions by \u2206\u03c72 = 4. Here, \u03c720\nrefers to the best-fit model.\nTable 3.

Cosmological Data\n4.2.1. Large Scale Structure. At present there are two large galaxy surveys of\ncomparable size, the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) [34, 35] and the 2 degree Field\nGalaxy Redshift Survey (2dFGRS) [36]. Once the SDSS is completed it will be\nsignificantly larger and more accurate than the 2dFGRS. We will only use data from\n\n\fNew cosmological mass limit on thermal relic axions\n\n11\n\nSDSS, but the results would be almost identical with 2dFGRS data. We use only data\non scales larger than k = 0.15 h Mpc\u22121 to avoid problems with non-linearity.\n4.2.2.\nCosmic Microwave Background. The CMB temperature fluctuations are\nconveniently described in terms of the spherical harmonics power spectrum ClT T \u2261\nP\n(\u03b8, \u03c6) = lm alm Ylm (\u03b8, \u03c6). Since Thomson scattering polarizes light,\nh|alm |2 i, where \u2206T\nT\nthere are also power spectra coming from the polarization. The polarization can be\ndivided into a curl-free (E) and a curl (B) component, yielding four independent power\nspectra: ClT T , ClEE , ClBB , and the T -E cross-correlation ClT E .\nThe WMAP experiment has reported data only on ClT T and ClT E as described in\nRefs. [37\u201341]. We have performed our likelihood analysis using the prescription given by\nthe WMAP collaboration [38\u201341] which includes the correlation between different Cl 's.\nForeground contamination has already been subtracted from their published data.\n4.2.3. Supernova luminosity distances. We use the \"gold\" data set compiled and\ndescribed by Riess et al. [42] consisting of 157 SNe Ia using a modified version of the\nSNOC package [43].\n4.2.4. The Lyman-\u03b1 forest. We have furthermore used the Lyman-\u03b1 forest data from\nCroft et al. [44]. The error bars on the last three data points have been increased in\nthe same fashion as was done by the WMAP collaboration [37\u201341], in order to make\nthem compatible with the analysis of Gnedin and Hamilton [45]. While there is some\ncontroversy about the use of Lyman-\u03b1 data for parameter estimation it should be noted\nthat their inclusion has only a very small quantitative effect on our results as will become\nclear below.\n4.2.5. Hubble parameter. Additionally we use data on the Hubble parameter from the\nHST key project [46], h = H0 /(100 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 ) = 0.72 \u00b1 0.08.\n4.3. Limits on axion parameters\nAfter marginalizing over the cosmological parameters shown in Table 3, the 68% and\n95% CL allowed regions of axion parameters are shown in Fig. 5. In the upper panel\nwe have included the full data set described above, while in the lower panel we have\nremoved the Lyman-\u03b1 data that is perhaps our most uncertain input.\nThe Lyman-\u03b1 data only has a significant impact for high values of g\u2217 because\nit measures very small scales. The large-scale structure data loses sensitivity at\n\u22121\nk<\n\u223c 0.15 h Mpc , whereas the Lyman-\u03b1 data probes scales which are about an order\nof magnitude smaller. For high g\u2217 , the particle mass for a given value of \u03a9a h2 is higher\nand therefore the free-streaming length is correspondingly smaller. The change in power\nspectrum amplitude occurs at k > 0.15 h Mpc\u22121 and is only measurable in the Lyman-\u03b1\ndata when g\u2217 >\n\u223c 60\u201370.\n\n\fNew cosmological mass limit on thermal relic axions\n\n12\n\nFigure 5. Likelihood contours for the allowed axion parameters. Everything to the\nright of the dark shaded region is excluded at the 68% CL, and everything to the right\nof the light shaded region is excluded at the 95% CL. Contours of equal axion mass\nwith the indicated ma values in eV are shown as dashed lines. Upper panel: All data\nincluded. Lower panel: Lyman-\u03b1 data excluded.\n\nIn Fig. 6 we show the same analysis as in the upper panel of Fig. 5, but now\ntransformed to the ma -g\u2217 -plane. The hadronic axion model is shown as a thick solid\nline. It lies at relatively small values of g\u2217 for the relevant mass range, meaning that\nthere will be very little quantitative difference if the Lyman-\u03b1 data is not used.\n\n\fNew cosmological mass limit on thermal relic axions\n\n13\n\nFigure 6. Likelihood contours including all data, equivalent to the upper panel of\nFig. 5, transformed to the parameter plane of g\u2217 and ma . The relation between g\u2217 and\nma for hadronic axions is shown as a thick solid line.\n\nFigure 7. Likelihood contours including all data, equivalent to the upper panel of\nFig. 5, transformed to the parameter plane of fa and ma . We have used the connection\nbetween g\u2217 and fa for hadronic axions as shown in Fig. 4 and Table 2. The standard\nma -fa -relation of Eq. (1) is shown as a thick solid line.\n\n\fNew cosmological mass limit on thermal relic axions\n\n14\n\nLikewise, in Fig. 7 we show the analysis in the ma -fa -plane, where the relationship\nbetween fa and g\u2217 shown in Fig. 4 and Table 2 has been used. In this figure, the true\nindependent variable on the vertical axis is the axion-pion coupling that was transformed\nto a value for the PQ scale assuming the hadronic case Eq. (5). For other models with\ndifferent Ca\u03c0 , the vertical axis in Fig. 7 must be re-scaled accordingly. Moreover, the\nstandard relationship between ma and fa of Eq. (1) and the hadronic axion-pion coupling\nof Eq. (5) put axions on the thick solid line.\nIn this case, where the most specific assumptions about the underlying axion model\nwere made, the axion parameter space collapses to one dimension, leading to a more\nrestrictive mass limit. In Fig. 8 we show a one-dimensional likelihood analysis for this\ncase, i.e. for the hadronic axion model. As a result one finds a 95% CL excluded region\nfor ma of\nma < 1.05 eV (95% CL),\n\n(13)\n\nbased on all the available observational data. For comparison we note that the same\ndata and the same analysis method provide\nX\n\nm\u03bd < 0.65 eV (95% CL)\n\n(14)\n\nfor neutrinos [31].\n\nFigure 8. One-dimensional likelihood analysis for the hadronic axion model obeying\nEq. (1). Shown is \u2206\u03c72 = \u03c72 \u2212 \u03c720 as a function of ma where \u03c720 refers to the best-fit\nmodel. In this 1D analysis the 95% excluded region is at \u2206\u03c72 > 4, and the 68%\nexcluded region at \u2206\u03c72 > 1, as indicated by the horizontal dashed lines.\n\n\fNew cosmological mass limit on thermal relic axions\n\n15\n\n5. Summary\nWe have studied structure-formation limits on axions or other scalar particles that have\na small mass and that couple to pions by virtue of the Lagrangian Eq. (4). Our main\nresult is the exclusion range in the two-dimensional fa -ma parameter space shown in\nFig. 7 where the axion-pion coupling strength of Eq. (5) was assumed, i.e. this is an\nexclusion range in the parameter space of axion mass and axion-pion coupling. Assuming\nin addition the standard ma -fa relationship of Eq. (1), we find a limit on the axion mass\nof ma < 1.05 eV (95% CL), corresponding to fa > 5.7 \u00d7 106 GeV.\nA comparable axion mass limit is obtained from the requirement that excessive\nenergy losses of horizontal branch stars in globular clusters should be avoided [12].\nHowever, the globular-cluster limit depends on the axion-photon interaction that is\nrather model dependent.\nThe neutrino observations of supernova 1987A provide restrictive limits on the\n9\naxion-nucleon interaction, suggesting ma <\n\u223c 0.6 \u00d7 10 GeV if one assumes\n\u223c 0.01 eV or fa >\ngeneric coupling strengths between axions and nucleons. However, the supernova\nargument may leave open the \"hadronic axion window\" of about 3 \u00d7 105 GeV <\n\u223c3\u00d7\n\u223c fa <\n6\n10 GeV [17, 18]. Our result closes this window, at least for generic values of the axionnucleon and axion-pion couplings.\nMore importantly, we have provided a new limit on axion parameters based on\na different interaction channel than previous limits and based on different data and\nassumptions. Every experimental measurement and every astrophysical or cosmological\nargument has its own systematic uncertainties and its own recognized or un-recognized\nloop holes. Therefore, to corner axions it is certainly important to use as many\nindependent interaction channels and as many different approaches as possible.\nAn ongoing experimental axion search, the CERN Axion Solar Telescope (CAST), is\nbased on the axion-photon interaction. It has reported first limits for ma <\n\u223c 0.02 eV [47].\nIn the second phase it will cover axion masses up to approximately 1 eV. It is noteworthy\nthat our new limit is almost identical with the upper mass range that can be reached\nwith CAST, i.e. the CAST search and our new limit are nicely complementary.\nAcknowledgments\nWe acknowledge use of the publicly available CMBFAST package [32] and of computing\nresources at DCSC (Danish Center for Scientific Computing).
