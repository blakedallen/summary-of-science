Box 373, 1090 Sofia, Bulgaria\n\nAbstract\nLet P (x) be a real polynomial of degree 2g + 1, H = y 2 + P (x) and \u03b4(h)\nbe an oval contained in the level set {H = h}. We study complete Abelian\nintegrals of the form\nZ\n(\u03b10 + \u03b11 x + . . . + \u03b1g\u22121 xg\u22121 )dx\n, h \u2208 \u03a3,\nI(h) =\ny\n\u03b4(h)\nwhere \u03b1i are real and \u03a3 \u2282 R is a maximal open interval on which a continuous family of ovals {\u03b4(h)} exists. We show that the g-dimensional real vector\nspace of these integrals is not Chebyshev in general: for any g > 1, there are\nhyperelliptic Hamiltonians H and continuous families of ovals \u03b4(h) \u2282 {H = h},\nh \u2208 \u03a3, such that the Abelian integral I(h) can have at least [ 32 g] \u2212 1 zeros in \u03a3.\nOur main result is Theorem 1 in which we show that when g = 2, exceptional\nfamilies of ovals {\u03b4(h)} exist, such that the corresponding vector space is still\nChebyshev.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nTake real polynomials H, f, g \u2208 R[x, y] and let \u03b4(h) \u2282 {(x, y) \u2208 R2 : H(x, y) = h},\nh \u2208 \u03a3, be a continuous family of ovals. For sufficiently small \u03b5 and generic H, f, g,\nthe limit cycles of the perturbed plane Hamiltonian system\ndH + \u03b5(f dx + gdy) = 0\n\n1\n\n\fwhich tend to certain ovals from the continuous family when \u03b5 \u2192 0, are in one-to-one\ncorrespondence with the zeros of the complete Abelian integral\nZ\nI(h) =\nf (x, y)dx + g(x, y)dy, h \u2208 \u03a3.\n\u03b4(h)\n\nFor this reason the problem of finding the zeros of I(h) in terms of the degrees of\nH, f, g was called by Arnold [5, p. 313] the \"weakened 16th Hilbert problem\" (compare\nto Hilbert [19], see also Arnold [6, 7, 8]). Note that the level sets {H = h} will contain\nin general several continuous families of ovals which need be considered separately.\nIt follows from the Varchenko-Khovanskii theorem that the number of the zeros\nof I(h) is bounded by a constant N(n, d) < \u221e, uniformly in all H, f, g, such that\ndeg f \u2264 d, deg g \u2264 d, deg H \u2264 n.\nIn the so called \"hyperelliptic case\" (H = y 2 +P (x)) it was proved by Novikov and\nYakovenko[20] that there exists an algorithm producing a function C(n, d) such that\n\u221e > C(n, d) > N(n, d), which is given by a tower function (an iterated exponent)\nof height at least five. Their proof is based on the analytic properties of a suitable\nPicard-Fuchs system satisfied by Abelian integrals (including the magnitude of the\ncoefficients of the system and some restrictions on its monodromy group).\nThe progress in solving the weakened 16th Hilbert problem (finding the exact\nnumber of the zeros of I(h)) concerned so far the \"elliptic case\" only (the complex\nalgebraic curve {H = h} is of genus at most one). It was proved for instance that\nin several cases, the vector space AH,d of Abelian integrals of degree d polynomials\nalong the ovals of H, obeys the so called Chebyshev property (the number of the\nzeros of each integral is smaller than the dimension of the vector space AH,d ), see\n[21, 15, 14, 11]. In this relation Arnold asked in [8, the 7th problem] whether the\ng-dimensional vector space of Abelian integrals\nZ\n(\u03b10 + \u03b11 x + . . . + \u03b1g\u22121 xg\u22121 )dx\nI(h) =\n, h\u2208\u03a3\n(1)\ny\n\u03b4(h)\nwhere \u03b4(h) \u2282 {(x, y) \u2208 R2 : y 2 + P (x) = h}, g = [ 12 (deg P \u2212 1)] > 1, is Chebyshev.\nIn an attempt to solve this problem Givental [17] obtained a non-oscillation theorem Rfor Lagrangian planes of the Picard-Fuchs system satisfied by the Abelian integrals \u03b4(h) xi dx/y. He used the fact that every Picard-Fuchs system has a Hamiltonian\n(or Poisson) structure. He failed, however, to produce bounds for the zeros of the\nAbelian integrals.\nIn the present paper we try to explore the algebro-geometrical properties of the\nAbelian integrals, without using the Picard-Fuchs system. Our main result is Theorem 1 in which we show that when g = 2 and deg P = 5, exceptional families of ovals\n{\u03b4(h)}, h \u2208 \u03a3, exist such that every Abelian integral of the form\nZ\n(\u03b10 + \u03b11 x)dx\nI(h) =\n, \u03b102 + \u03b112 6= 0\ny\n\u03b4(h)\nhas at most one simple zero on the interval R\u03a3. At a first sight\nthis seems to be an easy\nR\nobservation (equivalent to the claim that ( \u03b4(h) xdx/y)/( \u03b4(h) dx/y) is monotonous on\n2\n\n\f\u03a3). This is, however, the first result of such a kind for non-elliptic curves {H = h}.\nThe proof uses the Riemann bilinear relations on differentials of the first kind together\nwith the fact that a Jacobian variety with its polarization cannot be a direct product\nof principally polarized Abelian varieties. Our arguments can be adapted to other\nsituations (for instance when the degree of P (x) is 6), but we shall not do this here.\nWe give also a negative answer (Proposition 2) to the initial question posed by\nArnold: it turns out that there exist Abelian integrals of the form (1) with exactly\n[ 23 g] \u2212 1 zeros in a neighborhood of the origin.\n\n2\n\nThe cyclicity at a center\n\nIn this section we prove that in general, the integral (1) does not belong to a Chebyshev space. Consider first the particular case when n = 5. Let H = y 2 + P (x)\nwhere P (x) = x2 (1 + a1 x + a2 x2 + a3 x3 ), a1 , a2 , a3 \u2208 R, a3 6= 0, and denote by\n\u03b4(t) \u2282 {y 2 + P (x) = t} a continuous family of cycles vanishing at the origin as t tends\nto zero.\nProposition 1 The Abelian integral\nZ\n(\u03b10 + \u03b11 x)dx\nI(t) =\n= \u03b10 I0 (t) + \u03b11 I1 (t) 6\u2261 0\ny\n\u03b4(t)\ncan have a zero at the origin of multiplicity at most two. Moreover, for fixed \u03b11 , a2 , a3 ,\n\u03b11 a3 6= 0, there exist a sufficiently small \u03b5 > 0 and \u03b10 , a1 in a small neighborhood of\nzero, such that I(t) has exactly two simple zeros in the interval (0, \u03b5).\nThe above shows that the real vector space generated by the functions I0 (t), I1 (t) is\nnot Chebyshev. Recall that a real vector space V of functions defined on some interval\n\u03a3 is said to be Chebyshev, provided that each f \u2208 V has at most dim V \u2212 1 zeros\n(counted with multiplicity) on \u03a3, and Chebyshev with accuracy m, if each f \u2208 V has\nat most dim V + m \u2212 1 zeros there.\nProof of Proposition 1. For a small x, denote X = x(1 + a1 x + a2 x2 + a3 x3 )1/2 .\nThen an easy calculation yields the inverse transformation\nx = \u03c6(X) \u223c X \u2212 12 a1 X 2 + ( 85 a21 \u2212 21 a2 )X 3 \u2212 (a31 \u2212 32 a1 a2 + 12 a3 )X 4 + . . .\n\nas X \u2192 0.\n\nTherefore, for small positive t,\nZ\n[\u03b10 + \u03b11 \u03c6(X)]\u03c6\u2032(X)\nI(t) =\ndX\ny\ny 2 +X 2 =t\nZ\na3 \u2212 27 a1 a2 + a3 )X 4 + O(X 6)]\n\u03b10 [1 + O(X 2 )] \u2212 \u03b11 [ 32 a1 X 2 + 25 ( 21\n8 1\n=\ndX\ny\ny 2 +X 2 =t\n= 2\u03c0\u03b10 [1 + O(t)] \u2212 2\u03c0\u03b11 [ 43 a1 t +\n\n15 21 3\n( a\n16 8 1\n\n3\n\n\u2212 72 a1 a2 + a3 )t2 + O(t3 )].\n\n\fWhen \u03b10 = a1 = 0, the function I(t) has a double zero at the origin since \u03b11 a3 6= 0.\nTaking \u03b11 = 1, |\u03b10 | << |a1 | << |a3 | and \u03b10 a1 > 0 > a1 a3 , one finishes the proof of the\nproposition. \u2737\nClearly, the above approach could be applied to hyperelliptic Hamiltonians of any\ndegree that have a center.\nDenote by Hn the set of Hamiltonians H = y 2 + x2 + a1 x3 + . . . + an\u22122 xn , where\nak \u2208 R, an\u22122 6= 0. Denote by g = [ 21 (n \u2212 1)] \u2265 2 the genus of the hyperelliptic curve.\nGiven H \u2208 Hn , let \u03b4(t), t \u2208 (0, TH ), be an oval from the continuous family of ovals\nsurrounding the center at the origin. Consider the vector space AH formed by the\nAbelian integrals\nZ\nG(x)dx\nI(t) =\n, t \u2208 (0, TH ), G \u2208 R[x], deg G < g.\n(2)\ny\n\u03b4(t)\nLet us point out that dim HH = g in general, but dim HH = [ 12 (g + 1)] provided that\nH contains no odd degree monomials. In the proposition below, we give a partial\nanswer to the question raised by V. Arnold'd in [8].\nProposition 2 There exist H \u2208 Hn and a polynomial G such that the corresponding\nintegral (2) has exactly [ 23 g] \u2212 1 small positive simple zeroes.

Take as above X = x(1+a1 x+. . .+an\u22122 xn\u22122 )1/2 , then the inverse transformation x = \u03c6(X, a1 , a2 , . . . , an\u22122 ) for small X reads x = X + A1 X 2 + A2 X 3 + A3 X 4 + . . .,\nwhere the coefficients Aj = Aj (a1 , a2 , . . . , an\u22122 ) are polynomials.

To calculate the coefficient at\nak in Ak , we take a1 = . . . = ak\u22121 = 0, and easily obtain that it equals \u2212 21 .

In the rest of the paper, we concentrate our efforts on the\nsimplest case when deg P = 5. We begin with some preliminaries.\n\n3\n\nThe normal form, the bifurcation diagram and\nthe Dynkin diagram for n = 5\n\nWe consider the hyperelliptic Hamiltonian H = 21 y 2 + P (x) where P \u2208 R[x] and\ndeg P = 5. Assume that a certain level set {H = h} contains an oval (compact\nclosed smooth curve without critical points). As the Poincar\u00e9 index of the respective\nHamiltonian vector field XH is zero, then XH has at least two different real critical\npoints. Without any loss of generality, we can place all the four critical points at (0, 0),\n(\u03bc, 0), (\u03bb, 0) and (1, 0), where either 0 \u2264 \u03bc \u2264 \u03bb \u2264 1 (the real case) or \u03bc\u0304 = \u03bb \u2208 C \\ R\n(the complex case). Finally, we can assume that the coefficient at x5 is positive. Then\nafter rescaling of the y variable, we come to the normal form\n1\n\u03bb\u03bc 2 \u03bb + \u03bc + \u03bb\u03bc 3 1 + \u03bb + \u03bc 4 1 5 1 2\nH(x, y) = y 2 \u2212\nx +\nx \u2212\nx + x \u2261 y + P (x)\n2\n2\n3\n4\n5\n2\n\n(3)\n\nand the Hamiltonian flow XH takes the form\n\u1e8b = y,\n\u1e8f = \u2212x(x \u2212 \u03bc)(x \u2212 \u03bb)(x \u2212 1).\n\n(4)\n\nUntil the end of the paper, we will use this normal form of H only.\nClearly, the origin is a hyperbolic saddle if \u03bc 6= 0, and (1, 0) is a nondegenerate\ncenter provided that \u03bb 6= 1. In addition, when 0 < \u03bc < \u03bb < 1 in the real case, (\u03bc, 0) is\na center and (\u03bb, 0) is a saddle. Denote by h0 , h\u03bc , h\u03bb and h1 the corresponding critical\nlevels of H. One has\n1\n(3 \u2212 5\u03bb \u2212 5\u03bc + 10\u03bb\u03bc),\nh1 = \u2212 60\n\nh0 = 0,\n3\n\nh\u03bb = \u2212 \u03bb60 (3\u03bb2 \u2212 5\u03bb\u03bc \u2212 5\u03bb + 10\u03bc),\n3\n\nh\u03bc = \u2212 \u03bc60 (3\u03bc2 \u2212 5\u03bb\u03bc \u2212 5\u03bc + 10\u03bb).\nIf 0 < \u03bc < \u03bb < 1, we have h0 > h\u03bc , h\u03bb > h\u03bc , h\u03bb > h1 . The bifurcation diagram D in\nthe real case consists of the boundary of the triangle T = {0 \u2264 \u03bc \u2264 \u03bb \u2264 1} and the\n6\n\n\fcurve \u03b3 : h\u03bb = h0 having an equation\n\u03bc=\n\n3\u03bb2 \u2212 5\u03bb\n,\n5(\u03bb \u2212 2)\n\nsee Fig. 1.\n\n\u03bc\n\n1\n\n\u03b3\n\n2/5\n\n\u03bb\n0\n\n1\n\n\u03b3\n\nFigure 1: Bifurcation diagram in the (\u03bb, \u03bc)-plane in the real case\nThere are two open components in T \\ D giving the two generic cases. Namely,\nfor parameters \u03bb, \u03bc above the curve \u03b3, XH has three period annuli, and below this\ncurve XH has just two period annuli. There are also five codimension-one and four\ncodimension-two degenerate (nongeneric) cases corresponding to the parameters on\nthe bifurcation diagram D. In the complex case, there is a unique period annulus\naround (1, 0) which terminates at the saddle-loop through (0, 0) and the phase portraits for all \u03bb \u2208 C \\ R are topologically equivalent. We will denote the period annuli\n(continuous families of ovals) around (1, 0), (\u03bc, 0) and the eight loop by O1 , O\u03bc and\nOe , respectively.\nBelow we describe the Dynkin diagram of the real polynomial H(x, y) when the\ncritical levels are distinct. Recall that it is a graph defined in the same way as the\nDynkin diagram (or D-diagram) of a germ of an analytical function with an isolated\n7\n\n\fsingularity, see [3, 10]. The vertices of the diagram are in one-to-one correspondence\nwith the vanishing cycles of the polynomial. Two vertices are connected by an edge\nif the intersection number of the cycles is not zero. To an edge one associates also a\nlabel equal to the intersection number, but it will be omitted here because is of no\nimportance for us. The vanishing cycles \"vanish\" along suitable paths, and hence the\nDynkin diagram depends also on the family of paths. The precise definition in our\nsituation is as follows.\nConsider first the real case 0 < \u03bc < \u03bb < 1. There are five possible distributions\nof the critical values as follows:\nh1 < h\u03bc < h\u03bb < h0 , h1 < h\u03bc < h0 < h\u03bb , h\u03bc < h1 < h0 < h\u03bb ,\nh\u03bc < h0 < h1 < h\u03bb , h\u03bc < h1 < h\u03bb < h0 .\nFor definiteness, assume that h1 < h\u03bc < h\u03bb < h0 . Denote D = C\\[h\u03bb , \u221e) and let\nl0 , l1 , l\u03bb , l\u03bc : [0, 1] \u2192 {h \u2208 C : Im h \u2265 0}\nbe continuous paths connecting some fixed regular value h\u0303 \u2208 D to h0 , h1 , h\u03bb , h\u03bc\nrespectively, as shown on Fig. 2.\nThe Dynkin diagram of H with respect to the above paths is a graph with four\nvertices corresponding to the four families of cycles vanishing along the paths l0 ,\nl1 , l\u03bb , l\u03bc , which we denote by \u03b40 (h), \u03b41 (h), \u03b4\u03bc (h), \u03b4\u03bb (h) respectively. Two vertices\nare connected by an edge if the intersection number of the cycles for h = h\u0303 is not\nzero (in which case it is \u00b11 and may be supposed equal to one). The computation\nof the Dynkin diagram of a real polynomial with real critical points only is well\nknown, see for instance [1, 3]. It yields the diagram shown on Fig. 2. We note\nthat the computation depends only on the distribution of the four critical points\n0 < \u03bc < \u03bb < 1 and not on the distribution of the respective critical values (hence,\nthe Dynkin diagram is the same for all possible arrangements of the critical values\nwith corresponding paths l0 , l1 , l\u03bb , l\u03bc ).\nConsider now the complex case when \u03bb = \u03bc\u0304 6\u2208 R. The method we use is a\ndeformation of H to a polynomial having real critical points. Denote D = C\\[h0 , \u221e)\nand let\nl0 , l1 , l\u03bb , l\u03bc : [0, 1] \u2192 D\nbe continuous paths connecting some fixed regular value h\u0303 \u2208 D to h0 , h1 , h\u03bb , h\u03bc\nrespectively, as shown on Fig. 3. The Dynkin diagram related to these paths is\ndefined as above. Consider in the complex plane the hyperbola \u0393 defined by the\nequation\n\u0393 : h\u03bb = h\u03bc \u21d4 (Im \u03bb)2 = 5Re \u03bb(Re \u03bb \u2212 1)\n(5)\nand drawn on Fig. 5.\nSuppose for definiteness that \u03bb lies inside its left branch. First, by continuous\ndeformation of \u03bb = \u03bc\u0304 such that in the course of the deformation \u03bb remains in the left\nbranch of (5), we may achieve that \u03bb = \u03bc < 0 < 1. This, combined with h\u03bb = h\u03bc < 0\nalready implies that\n8\n\n\fs h\u0303\n\nh1\n\nh\u03bc\n\nh\u03bb\n\nh0\n\ns\n\ns\n\ns\n\ns\n\n\u03b41\n\u2732\n\n\u03b4\u03bb\n\n\u03b4\u03bc\n\n\u03b40\n\ns\n\ns\n\ns\n\ns\n\n(i)\n\n(ii)\n\nFigure 2: (i) The paths l0 , l1 , l\u03bb , l\u03bc in the real case 0 < \u03bc < \u03bb < 1 when h1 < h\u03bc <\nh\u03bb < h0 ; (ii) Dynkin diagram in the real case 0 < \u03bc < \u03bb < 1\n\u2022 the intersection number of \u03b41 (h\u0303) and \u03b40 (h\u0303) is equal to \u00b11;\n\u2022 the intersection number of \u03b4\u03bb (h\u0303), \u03b4\u03bc (h\u0303) with \u03b41 (h\u0303) is zero;\n\u2022 the intersection number of \u03b4\u03bb (h\u0303) and \u03b4\u03bc (h\u0303) is equal to \u00b11;\n\u2022 The intersection number of either \u03b4\u03bb (h\u0303) or \u03b4\u03bc (h\u0303) with \u03b40 (h\u0303) is equal to \u00b11.\nFinally, we may use the real structure of the complex algebraic curve\n\u0393h = {(x, y) \u2208 C2 : H(x, y) = h}\nfor h \u2208 R. This structure is defined by an antiholomorphic involution i on the curve\nwhich is the complex conjugation. It induces on its hand an involution i\u2217 of H1 (\u0393h , Z),\n(i\u2217 )2 = id. It is easy to see that for h < 0 we have\ni\u2217 \u03b4\u03bb (h) = \u03b4\u03bc (h),\n\ni\u2217 \u03b40 (h) = \u2212\u03b40 (h).\n\nThis combined with the identity\nh\u03b4(h), \u03b3(h)i = \u2212hi\u2217 \u03b4(h), i\u2217 \u03b3(h)i\nshows that\nh\u03b4\u03bb (h), \u03b40 (h)i = h\u03b4\u03bc (h), \u03b40 (h)i.\nThis implies the Dynkin diagram as shown on Fig. 3(ii)). The remaining cases shown\nthere are studied in a similar way.\nWe finish this section by introducing a property of the continuous families of ovals\nwhich is dependent on the structure of the related Dynkin diagram. Suppose that the\nreal polynomial H = y 2 + P (x) has distinct critical values.

The family {\u03b4(h)}\nrepresents a continuous family of cycles vanishing at the center \u03b4(hc ). To formulate\nour main result we shall need the following\nDefinition 1 It is said that {\u03b4(h)} is an exceptional family of ovals, provided that\nfor every polynomial one-form \u03c9 the Abelian integral\nZ\nI(h) =\n\u03c9, h \u2208 \u03a3\n\u03b4(h)\n\nallows an analytic continuation in the sector S\u03b5 (hs ) = {h \u2208 C : Arg(h \u2212 hs ) \u2208\n(\u2212\u03b5, 2\u03c0 + \u03b5)} for some strictly positive \u03b5. The corresponding family of vanishing\ncycles represented by \u03b4(h) is called an exceptional family of vanishing cycles.\nThe above definition has in fact a geometric nature. Indeed, I(h) has an analytic\ncontinuation in the sector S\u03b5 (hs ) if and only if \u03b4(h) has an appropriate intersection\nnumber with each of the other families of vanishing cycles. For instance, if \u03bb, \u03bc are\nreal and h1 < h\u03bc < h\u03bb < h0 , then the family of cycles \u03b41 (h) is exceptional, because\nit has zero intersection number with \u03b40 (h). On the contrary, the family \u03b4\u03bc (h) is not\nexceptional, because it has a non-zero intersection number with \u03b40 (h). The remaining\npossible distributions of the critical values, as well as the case \u03bb, \u03bc 6\u2208 R, are studied\nin the same way. We summarize all this in the following\nProposition 3 Suppose that the Hamiltonian H(x, y) is taken in a normal form (3)\nand has four distinct critical values. Then:\n(i) In the real case (0 < \u03bc < \u03bb < 1), the continuous family of ovals O1 surrounding\nthe center (1, 0) is exceptional, and the continuous family of ovals O\u03bc surrounding the\ncenter (\u03bc, 0) is not exceptional.\n(ii) In the complex case (\u03bb = \u03bc\u0304 6\u2208 R), the continuous family of ovals O1 is exceptional\nif and only if \u03bb lies inside the left branch of the hyperbola \u0393 (see (5) and Fig. 5).\n\n4\n\nThe period integral in a complex domain\n\nAssume that the level curve {H = h} contains an oval \u03b4(h) and consider the integral\n(oriented along with the vector field (4))\nI\ndx\nI0 (h) =\n\u03b4(h) y\nwhich is the derivative of the area inside \u03b4(h) and hence determines the period of\nthe periodic orbit lying on \u03b4(h). Denote by \u03b1(h) and by \u03b2(h) the minimal and the\nmaximal values of x for (x, y) \u2208 \u03b4(h). These are among the real solutions of the\nequation P (x) = h. Then one can express I0 (h) in the form\n\u221a Z \u03b2(h)\ndx\np\n.\nI0 (h) = 2\nh \u2212 P (x)\n\u03b1(h)\n11\n\n\fConsider first the case 0 < \u03bc < \u03bb < 1 and assume that \u03b4(h) belongs to either of the\ncontinuous families of ovals O\u03bc , O1 surrounding centers (\u03bc, 0) and (1, 0), respectively.\nThe corresponding families of cycles vanish respectively at h = h\u03bc and h = h1 .\nDenote this value in both cases by hc and assume that the real ovals are defined in\n\u03a3 = (hc , hs ). Finally, denote by xc the x-coordinate of the corresponding center. We\nkeep the same notation in the complex case and in the cases when either \u03bc = 0 or\n\u03bc = \u03bb or \u03bb = 1. Then xc is the x-coordinate of the unique nondegenerate center (as\nlong as (\u03bb, \u03bc) 6\u2208 {(1, 0), (1, 1)}).\nThe integral I0 (h) has an analytic continuation for h < hs . We wish to prove that\nI0 (h) 6= 0 in (\u2212\u221e, hc ). The precise statement is as follows.\nProposition 4 Assume that the parameters \u03bb, \u03bc in (3) are either real or lie inside\nthe hyperbola \u0393. Then the integral I0 (h) related to any period annulus around a nondegenerate center of (4) has an analytic continuation in (\u2212\u221e, hs ) and takes positive\nvalues there.\nProof. The claim that I0 (h) has an analytic continuation in the interval (\u2212\u221e, hs )\nis obvious in the complex case (\u03bb = \u03bc\u0304 6\u2208 R). In the real case this follows from the\nDynkin diagram shown on Fig. 2. For instance, if h1 < h\u03bc < h\u03bb < h0 as on Fig.\n2, and if hs = h\u03bb , hc = h1 , then the claim is obvious. If hs = h\u03bb , hc = h\u03bc , then\nthe claim is true again because the intersection number of \u03b4\u03bc and \u03b41 is equal to zero.\nThe remaining four configurations of critical values and period annuli are examined\nin the same way (with the help of Fig. 2). Note, however, that the integral I0 (h)\ncorresponding to the period annulus Oe (in this case \u03a3 = (h\u03bb , 0)) has no analytic\ncontinuation on the real axis outside \u03a3. This is so because the singularities in both\nh = h0 and h = h\u03bb are unavoidable. The same conclusion holds for some of the\ndegenerate cases as well.\nNext we shall prove the positivity of the period integral I0 (h) on (\u2212\u221e, hs ). We\nfirst choose a proper formula to present I0 (h) when h < hc . Take z = x + iy \u2208 C,\nh < hs and consider the polynomial h \u2212 P (z). By Taylor's formula,\nh \u2212 P (z) = h \u2212 P (x) + 21 y 2 P \u2032\u2032 (x) \u2212\n\n1 4 \u2032\u2032\u2032\u2032\ny P (x)\n24\n\n\u2212 iy[P \u2032(x) \u2212 61 y 2P \u2032\u2032\u2032 (x) + 15 y 4]\n\n\u2261 h \u2212 Q(x, y) \u2212 iyR(x, y)\nGiven h < hs , consider the equation h \u2212 P (z) = 0 and denote by \u03b6k (h), k = 1, 2,\nthe two branches of the algebraic function defined by h \u2212 P (\u03b6(h)) \u2261 0 which satisfy\n\u03b6(hc ) = (xc , 0). These functions are unique since P \u2032 (z) 6= 0 for z 6= 0, \u03bc, \u03bb, 1. For\nhc < h < hs , one has \u03b61 (h) = (\u03b1(h), 0) = \u03b1(h) and \u03b62 (h) = (\u03b2(h), 0) = \u03b2(h) where\n\u03b1, \u03b2 are as above. For h < hc , one has \u03b61 (h) = \u03b6\u03042 (h) \u2208 C. For a similarity in notation,\nwe put \u03b61 (h) = \u03b1(h) and \u03b62 (h) = \u03b2(h) = \u1fb1(h) where Im \u03b1 < 0. Denote by Ch the\ncurve in the complex plane connecting the points \u03b1(h), \u03b2(h) along R(x, y) = 0, if\nh < hc , and along the real line y = 0, if hc < h < hs . Then the integral I0 (h) is\nexpressed as\n\u221a Z\ndz\np\nI0 (h) = 2\n, h < hs .\n(6)\nh \u2212 Q(x, y)\nCh\n12\n\n\fLet h < hc . We will establish below that y = Im z can be used as a local coordinate on\nCh . Thus, dz = [x\u2032 (y) + i]dy where x(\u2212y) = x(y) = x. Denote for short yh = Im \u03b2(h)\nR\nR0\nRy\nand write Ch = \u2212yh + 0 h . Replacing y with \u2212y in the first integral, we obtain\n\u221a Z\nI0 (h) = 2 2\n\n0\n\nyh\n\ndy\np\n,\nQ(x(y), y) \u2212 h\n\nh < hc .\n\n(7)\n\nBelow we study the curve R : R(x, y) = 0 and establish that on this curve the\nreal-valued function Q(x, y) \u2212 h is positive for all h < hc .\nRecall that R has an equation 15 y 4 \u2212 16 y 2 P \u2032\u2032\u2032 (x) + P \u2032(x) = 0. We will study how\nthis algebraic curve changes when varying the parameters \u03bb, \u03bc. It turns out that a\nlocal analysis can be used to determine the global behavior of R. To begin with, we\nobserve that the Poincar\u00e9 index of any sufficiently big circle x2 + y 2 = r 2 subject to\nthe vector field dR(x, y) = 0 is \u22123. The critical points of R are determined from\nRx = Ry = 0, namely\n(i) y = 0, P \u2032\u2032 (x) = 0;\n(ii) y 2 =\n\n5\nP \u2032\u2032\u2032 (x),\n12\n\nP \u2032\u2032 (x) \u2212\n\n5\nP \u2032\u2032\u2032 (x)P \u2032\u2032\u2032\u2032 (x)\n72\n\n= 0.\n\n2\nIt is easy to verify that the Hessian Rxx Ryy \u2212 Rxy\nis negative at any (real) nondegen5\n1\nP \u2032\u2032\u2032 (\u03be)(P \u2032\u2032\u2032\u2032(\u03be))2 \u2212\nerate critical point (\u03be, \u03b7). Indeed, it equals \u2212 3 (P \u2032\u2032\u2032 (\u03be))2 and \u2212 108\n4\n(P \u2032\u2032\u2032 (\u03be))2, respectively in cases (i) and (ii). Hence, R has in general three nondegen9\nerate saddles and when two of the saddles collide, the resulting degenerate critical\npoint has only hyperbolic sectors around. In particular, (ii) has no solutions for\n0 < \u03bc < \u03bb < 1, since all the three critical points are then given by (i). Also, in\nthis case the curve R is free of critical points because the value of R at the saddle\n(\u03be, 0) is P \u2032 (\u03be) 6= 0. In general, one can prove that R has no critical points outside the real line. Indeed, taking a critical point z = \u03be + i\u03b7 with \u03b7 6= 0, one has\nP \u2032(z) = R(\u03be, \u03b7) + \u03b7(Ry (\u03be, \u03b7) + iRx (\u03be, \u03b7)) = R(\u03be, \u03b7) 6= 0 unless z = \u03bb or z = \u03bc (which\nmay happen in the complex case). However, by (ii), (Re \u03bb, \u00b1Im \u03bb) is a critical point\nif and only if \u03bb lies on the hyperbola \u0393, which is not our case. We have proved that\nthe only critical points R may have are (0, 0), (\u03bb, 0) and (1, 0) provided that \u03bc = 0,\n\u03bb = \u03bc, \u03bb = 1, respectively.\nAs a consequence, the branches of the level curve R do not intersect outside the\nreal line and all they do escape to infinity (in the directions of x and y altogether,\nas shown by the asymptotics at infinity). This is because any closed compact curve\nnecessarily surrounds a critical point having an index +1 and R(x, y) = const has no\nsuch points.\nAssume first that 0 < \u03bc < \u03bb < 1. Then the four branches of R have no common\npoints at all. This implies that the branches through (0, 0) and (\u03bc, 0) go to \u2212\u221e in the\nx-direction while the branches through (\u03bb, 0) and (1, 0) go to +\u221e, see Fig. 4. When\nrunning any of the branches, the y variable changes in a monotone way. (Otherwise,\nthere would exist a horizontal line y = const having at least 6 intersections with R\nwhich is impossible.) Finally, denote by \u03be any of 0, 1, \u03bb, \u03bc. The local equation of R\nnear the point (\u03be, 0) is y 2 = [6P \u2032\u2032 (\u03be)/P \u2032\u2032\u2032(\u03be)](x \u2212 \u03be) + O((x \u2212 \u03be)2) where the coefficient\nis negative for \u03be = 0, positive for \u03be = 1 and changes sign if \u03be = \u03bb, \u03bc. This latter is\n\n13\n\n\fbecause P \u2032\u2032\u2032 (\u03bb) and P \u2032\u2032\u2032 (\u03bc) change sign in T . On the (\u03bb, \u03bc) curve where P \u2032\u2032\u2032 vanishes,\nthe local equation of R becomes y 4 \u223c \u22125P \u2032\u2032 (\u03be)(x \u2212 \u03be) for \u03be = \u03bb, \u03bc. Summing up, we\nobtain the form of the curve R as given in Fig. 4. The arrows indicate the direction\nof the Hamiltonian vector field dR = 0.\n\n0\n\n\u03bc\n\n\u03bb\n\n1\n\nFigure 4: The curve R(x, y) = 0 for the case 0 < \u03bc < \u03bb < 1.\nIt is easy to see that q(y) = Q(x(y), y) \u2212 h does not change sign when y \u2208 (0, yh ).\nAs q(yh ) = 0, it suffices to show that q \u2032 (y) 6= 0. We first note that \u1e8f = \u2212Rx < 0 on\nthe branch through (hc , 0) we consider. Then, by Cauchy-Riemann equations,\nQx = (yR)y ,\n\nQy = \u2212(yR)x ,\n\nand we obtain on R = 0 that\nq \u2032 = Qy + x\u2032 Qx = \u2212\n\ny\n(R2 + Ry2 ) < 0.\nRx x\n\nThis implies that Q(x(y), y) \u2212 h > 0 for y \u2208 (0, yh ) and hence by (7), I0 (h) > 0 for\nh < hs .\nThe same analysis is applicable when \u03bc = 0 or \u03bc = \u03bb or \u03bb = 1, the unique\ndifference is that on Fig. 4 the corresponding branches touch each other at y = 0.\nLet us turn now to the complex case. Apart of the real case, the branches through\n(0, 0) and (1, 0) (let us denote them by R0 and R1 ) may bifurcate significantly. This is\nbecause they are not necessarily monotone with respect to y and may escape to either\n\u2212\u221e or +\u221e, in the x-direction. The complex plane is divided by the hyperbola \u0393\ninto three parts. In the outer domain (Im \u03bb)2 > 5Re \u03bb(Re \u03bb \u2212 1), R0 and R1 behave\n14\n\n\fas in Fig. 4, but are not necessarily monotone in y. Inside the left branch of the\nhyperbola, R0 and R1 look like the branches through \u03bb and 1 on Fig. 4, respectively.\nAnd inside the right branch, R0 and R1 behave as the branches through 0 and \u03bc on\nFig. 4, respectively. All this is easily verified by a simple deformation argument, with\na starting point on the appropriate side of triangle T .\nTo avoid complications, we regard only the parameters \u03bb, \u03bc in the complex plane\nwhich belong to the interior of \u0393 (which is the case to be considered in our main\ntheorem). Taking \u03bb = a + ib, then b2 < 5a(a \u2212 1). We are going to prove that R1 is\nmonotone with respect to y in this domain. If so, one obtains just as in the real case\nthat q(y) = Q(x(y), y) \u2212 h > 0 and the proof is complete.\nConsider first the interior of the left branch of \u0393. Then R1 lies in the half-plane\nx \u2265 1. To establish monotonicity, we rewrite R(x, y) as a polynomial in t = x \u2212 1.\nOne obtains\nR = t4 +(3\u22122a)t3 +(3\u22124a+a2 +b2 \u22122y 2 )t2 +(1\u22122a+a2 +b2 +(2a\u22123)y 2)t+R(1, y). (8)\nAssume that a \u2264 21 . As the first two coefficients of the polynomial are positive, then\naccording to Descartes rule of signs, (8) can have three positive roots only if the\ncoefficient at t2 is negative and the coefficient at t is positive. However, these two\nconditions contradict each other. Therefore each line y = const can intersect R1 in\nat most two points (counting multiplicity) and hence in a single point because the\nnumber of intersections should be an odd number.\nNow take \u03bb in the interior of the right branch of \u0393 and denote by (\u03be, \u03b7) the rightmost point of R1 in the half-plane y \u2265 0. Thus, \u03be \u2265 1 and \u03b7 \u2265 0. As above, one\nobtains with t = \u03be \u2212 x \u2265 0 that\nR = t4 \u2212 61 P \u2032\u2032\u2032\u2032 (\u03be)t3 + ( 21 P \u2032\u2032\u2032 (\u03be) \u2212 2y 2)t2 \u2212 (P \u2032\u2032(\u03be) \u2212 61 P \u2032\u2032\u2032\u2032 (\u03be)y 2)t + 51 (y 2 \u2212\n\n5\nP \u2032\u2032\u2032 (\u03be))2 .\n12\n\n(9)\nAs \u03b7 = 0 if P (\u03be) \u2264 0 and \u03b7 =\notherwise, the coefficient at t is negative\nfor y > \u03b7. Then by Descartes rule, (9) has only two positive roots and therefore the\npart of R1 above the line y = \u03b7 is monotone. It remains to consider the part below\nit (if \u03b7 > 0). In this domain (9) can have two complex roots and Descartes rule does\nnot yield the required result. We can proceed as follows. Assume that the part of R1\nin the upper half-plane lying below y = \u03b7 is not monotone. Denote by (\u03be1 , \u03b71 ) the\nfirst local maximum on R1 (starting from (1, 0)), thus 1 < \u03be1 < \u03be and 0 < \u03b71 < \u03b7.\nConsider also the branch R+ of R which is placed in the upper half-plane to the right\nof the p\nline x = \u03be (and above the line y = \u03b71 ). An easy calculation yields the equations\n\u221a\n) for the tangential lines of R at infinity. As their common\ny = \u00b1 5 \u00b1 2 5(x \u2212 1+2a\n4\npoint is different from (\u03be1 , \u03b71 ), there would always exist a tangential line l to R+ at\na finite point, which goes through (\u03be1 , \u03b71 ). However, then l would intersect R+ in at\nleast two points and R1 in at least three points, which is impossible because R is a\nquartic curve. The monotonicity of R1 is established. \u2737\n\u2032\u2032\u2032\n\n2\n\n5\nP \u2032\u2032\u2032 (\u03be)\n12\n\n15\n\n2\n\n\fProposition 5 Assume that \u03b4(h) is an exceptional\nfamily of ovals according to DefR\ninition 1. Then the period integral I0 (h) = \u03b4(h) dx/y has an analytic continuation in\nthe complex domain D = C \\ [hs , \u221e) and does not vanish there.\nProof. The proof that I0 (h) has an analytic continuation in D follows immediately\nfrom the definition of an exceptional family of ovals. To count the zeros of the\nanalytic function I0 (h) in D, we apply the argument principle to the complex domain\nDr obtained from D by removing the discs {h \u2208 C : |h\u2212hs | < r}, {h \u2208 C : |h| > 1/r},\nwhere r > 0 is a small enough constant. For this purpose we evaluate the increase of\nthe argument of I0 (h) when h runs the boundary of Dr in a positive direction.\nWe consider first the real case (0 < \u03bc < \u03bb < 1). The Picard-Lefschetz formula\nimplies that in a suitable complex neighborhood of hs it holds\nZ\ndx\n1\nI0 (h) = \u03c6(h) log(h \u2212 hs ) + \u03c8(h), \u03c6(h) =\n2\u03c0 \u03b4s (h) y\nwhere \u03c6, \u03c8 are locally holomorphic and, as it is easily checked, \u03c6(hs ) 6= 0.\nThe behavior of I0 (h) for |h| sufficiently big follows from the Picard-Lefschetz\nformula too, but the argument is more delicate. Let l be a simple closed path which\nmakes one turn in a positive direction around all the critical values of H. It induces\na monodromy map\nl\u2217 : H1 (\u0393h\u0303 , Z) \u2192 H1 (\u0393h\u0303 , Z),\n\n\u0393h\u0303 = {(x, y) \u2208 C : H(x, y) = h\u0303} .\n\nIt is shown for instance in [12] that l\u2217 coincides with the operator of classical monodromy of the singularity 12 y 2 + 51 x5 (which is the highest weighted homogeneous part\nof H). The characteristic polynomial P (z) of l\u2217 is now easily computed to be equal\nto P (z) = (z 5 + 1)/(z + 1) (see [9]). This shows that in a neighborhood of h = \u221e\non the projective sphere the integral I0 (h) is a meromorphic function of h1/10 . The\nsubstitution\nx \u2192 xh1/5 , y \u2192 yh1/2 , h \u2192 \u221e\ndefines an isotopy of the regular fibers of H and the regular fibers of its weighted\nhomogeneous part 12 y 2 + 15 x5 [12]. From this fact we deduce that\nI0 (h) = c\u221e h1/5\u22121/2 (1 + O(h\u22121/10 )).\nFor a further use we note that c\u221e 6= 0. Indeed, the one-form dx/y is not cohomologous\nto zero on the regular fibers of the polynomial 12 y 2 + 15 x5 (this follows from [13,\nTheorem 1.1]). On the other hand, the form of the characteristic polynomial of l\u2217\nshows that it is irreducible over the field of rational numbers. Therefore the span of\nl\u2217k \u03b4, k = 0, 1, 2, 3 generates the whole homology group of the fiber. This implies that\nif c\u221e = 0, then the restriction of dx/y on the regular fibers of 12 y 2 + 51 x5 defines the\nzero cohomology class which is a contradiction.\nThe above consideration shows that the decrease of the argument of I0 (h) along\n{h \u2208 C : |h| = 1/r} is close to 3\u03c0/5 and the increase of the argument of I0 (h) along\n{h \u2208 C : |h \u2212 hs | = r} is close to zero.\n16\n\n\fWe claim further that the imaginary part of I0 (h) along (r + hs , 1/r) does not\nvanish. Namely, denote the two determinations of I0 (h) on (r + hs , 1/r) by I0\u00b1 (h).\nSimilarly, denote by \u03b4 \u00b1 (h) the two determinations of the continuous family \u03b4(h) on\n(r + hs , 1/r). Since I0 is a real analytic function along (\u2212\u221e, hs ), we have\n\u221a\n\nI0+ (h) = I0\u2212 (h),\n\n\u03b4 + (h) = \u03b4 \u2212 (h),\n\nh > hs\n\nand hence 2 \u22121 Im I0+ (h) = I0+ (h)\u2212I0\u2212 (h). On the other hand \u03b4(h) is an exceptional\nfamily of ovals. Therefore the Picard-Lefschetz formula implies that for h > hs ,\nZ\ndx\n\u2212\n+\n\u2212\n+\n\u03b4 (h) \u2212 \u03b4 (h) = \u03b3(h),\nI0 (h) \u2212 I0 (h) =\n\u03b3(h) y\nwhere \u03b3(h) is a continuous family of cycles vanishing at h = hs , with intersection\nnumber h\u03b3, \u03b4 \u2212 i = 1.\n\u221a\nFinally, we note that after substituting y by \u22121y, the family of cycles \u03b3(h)\ncorresponds to a family of ovals surrounding a center. Moreover, in the real case the\nfull bifurcation diagram (consisting of the boundary of T and the parts of the curves\nh\u03bb = h0 , h\u03bc = h1 , h0 = h1 inside) images onto itself. For later use we also mention\nthat in the complex case, the interior of the hyperbola \u0393 images onto itself. All this\nholds because the corresponding Hamiltonians when taken in a normal form (3) are\nrelated by the formula\n\u221a\nH(x, \u22121y, \u03bb, \u03bc) = h1 \u2212 H(1 \u2212 x, y, 1 \u2212 \u03bc, 1 \u2212 \u03bb).\nR\nHence, it follows from Proposition 4 that \u03b3(h) dx/y does not vanish along (hs , \u221e).\nTherefore if h \u2208 (r + hs , 1/r), then Im I0\u00b1 (h) 6= 0 and hence the increase of the\nargument of Im I0\u00b1 (h) along (r + hs , 1/r) is at most \u03c0.\nSumming up the above information we conclude that the increase of the argument\nof I0 (h) along the boundary of Dr is strictly less than 2\u03c0. By the argument principle,\nI0 (h) does not vanish in Dr , and hence in D.\nThe complex case when \u03bb = \u03bc\u0304 6\u2208 R is studied in the same way. \u2737\n\n5\n\nThe Chebyshev property\n\nSuppose that the real polynomial H = y 2 + P (x) has distinct critical values. Let\n\u03b4(h) \u2282 {H = h} be a continuous family of ovals defined on a maximal open interval\n\u03a3 = (hc , hs ), where for h = hc the oval degenerates to a point \u03b4(hc ) which is a center\nand for h = hs the oval becomes a homoclinic loop of the Hamiltonian system dH = 0.\nDenote D = C \\ [hs , \u221e). The following theorem is our main result.\nTheorem 1 Let \u03b4(h), h \u2208 \u03a3 be an exceptional family of ovals of (3). Then the real\nvector space A = {\u03b10 I0 + \u03b11 I1 : \u03b10 , \u03b11 \u2208 R} of Abelian integrals\nZ\nZ\nxdx\ndx\n,\nI1 (h) =\n,\nh\u2208\u03a3\nI0 (h) =\n\u03b4(h) y\n\u03b4(h) y\nis Chebyshev in D and hence in \u03a3.\n17\n\n\fProof. Let \u03b4(h) where h \u2208 \u03a3 = (hc , hs ) be an exceptional family of ovals. According\nto Proposition 5, it suffices to show that the analytic function F (h) = \u03b10 +I1 (h)/I0 (h)\nhas at most one zero in the domain D. To prove this claim we apply the argument\nprinciple to F (h) in the complex domain Dr obtained from D by removing the discs\n{h \u2208 C : |h \u2212 hs | < r}, {h \u2208 C : |h| > 1/r}, where r > 0 is a small enough constant.\nAs in the proof of Proposition 5, we may check that:\n\u2022 if h \u223c \u221e, then I1 (h) is meromorphic with respect to h\u22121/10 and\nI1 (h) = c\u221e h2/5\u22121/2 (1 + O(h\u22121/10 )) where c\u221e 6= 0;\n\u2022 if h \u223c hs , then\nI1 (h) = \u03c61 (h) log(h \u2212 hs ) + \u03c81 (h),\n\n1\n\u03c61 (h) =\n2\u03c0\n\nZ\n\n\u03b4s (h)\n\nx dx\n,\ny\n\nwhere \u03c61 and \u03c81 are locally holomorphic. Moreover, it is easily verified that\nlim I1 (h)/I0 (h) = \u03c61 (hs )/\u03c6(hs ) = xs where (xs , 0) is the saddle point corre-\n\nh\u2192hs\n\nsponding to the critical value hs .\nTherefore the increase of the argument of F (h) along {h \u2208 C : |h| = 1/r} is close to\n2\u03c0/5 and the increase of the argument of F (h) along {h \u2208 C : |h| = r} is close to\nzero or strictly negative.\nWe claim further that\n\u2022 the imaginary part of F (h) along (r + hs , 1/r) does not vanish.\nIf this claim were proved then summing up the above information we would get that\nthe argument of F (h) increases along the boundary of Dr by at most 2\u03c0 + 2\u03c0/5. Thus\nthe function F (h) can have at most one zero in Dr and hence in C\\[hs , \u221e).\nIt remains to prove the above claim. Recall that, since \u03b4(h) is an exceptional\nfamily of ovals, then the two determinations of F (h) over (hs , \u221e), namely F \u00b1 (h), are\nanalytic along (hs , \u221e). The function F (h) is real analytic along (\u2212\u221e, hs ) and hence\n\u221a\n2 \u22121 Im F (h) = F + (h) \u2212 F \u2212 (h) \u2200h \u2208 (hs , \u221e).\nDenote by \u03b4 \u00b1 (h) the two determinations of \u03b4(h), h \u2208 D on (hs , \u221e), and let\n\u0393h = {(x, y) \u2208 C2 : H(x, y) = h}.\nIt was shown in the proof of Proposition 5 that\nZ\ndx\n6= 0 \u2200h \u2208 (hs , \u221e).\n\u03b4\u00b1 (h) y\nThen we obtain for each h \u2208 (hs , \u221e)\n\n2\n\n\u221a\n\n\u22121 Im F (h) =\n\nxdx\n+\ny\nR\u03b4 (h) dx\n\u03b4+ (h) y\n\nR\n\n\u2212\n\nxdx\n\u2212\ny\nR\u03b4 (h) dx\n\u03b4\u2212 (h) y\n\nR\n\n18\n\n=\n\n\uf8eb R\n\u03b4+ (h)\ndet \uf8ed R\n\nxdx\ny\n\nxdx\n\u03b4\u2212 (h) y\n\n|\n\ndx\n\u03b4+ (h) y\n\nR\n\ndx\n\u03b4\u2212 (h) y\n\nR\n\ndx 2\n|\n\u03b4\u00b1 (h) y\n\nR\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\n\n.\n\n\fTherefore we have to prove that the analytic function\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb R\nR\ndx\nxdx\n\u03b4+ (h) y \uf8f8\n\u03b4+ (h) y\n,\n\u2206(h) = det \uf8ed R\nR\nxdx\n\u03b4\u2212 (h) y\n\ndx\n\u03b4\u2212 (h) y\n\nh \u2208 (hs , \u221e)\n\ndoes not vanish.\nSuppose first that h = h0 \u2208 (hs , \u221e) is a critical value of H. The affine curve\n\u0393h0 is singular of arithmetic genus two. Let \u0393\u0304h0 be the corresponding completed and\nnormalized Riemann surface. As the geometric genus of \u0393\u0304h0 is one and the intersection\nnumber h\u03b4 + , \u03b4 \u2212 i equals +1, then \u03b4 + (h0 ) and \u03b4 \u2212 (h0 ) form a canonical homology basis\nof \u0393\u0304h0 . We have P (x) = (x \u2212 x0 )2 (x \u2212 x1 )(x \u2212 x2 )(x \u2212 x3 ) where xi 6= xj for i 6= j.\nTherefore, (x \u2212 x0 )dx/y induces a holomorphic one-form on \u0393\u0304h0 and dx/y induces a\nmeromorphic one-form of the third kind on \u0393\u0304h0 with simple poles at P \u00b1 , where P \u00b1\nare the two distinct pre-images of the singular point (x0 , 0) \u2208 \u0393h0 under the canonical\nprojection \u0393\u0304h0 \u2192 \u0393h0 . The reciprocity law for differentials of the first and third kind\n[18] applied to (x \u2212 x0 )dx/y, dx/y on the elliptic curve \u0393\u0304h0 gives\n\u0012 Z P\n\u0014\n\u0012 Z P\n\u0013\n\u0013\u0015\n\u221a\ndx\ndx\n(x \u2212 x0 )dx\n(x \u2212 x0 )dx\n\u2206(h) = 2\u03c0 \u22121 Res|P +\n+ Res|P \u2212\ny P0\ny\ny P0\ny\n\u221a\nZ P+\n\u00b12\u03c0 \u22121\ndx\np\n= p\n(x0 \u2212 x1 )(x0 \u2212 x2 )(x0 \u2212 x3 ) P \u2212\n(x \u2212 x1 )(x \u2212 x2 )(x \u2212 x3 )\nwhere the path of integration is on the Riemann surface \u0393\u0304h0 of the affine elliptic curve\n{y 2 = (x \u2212 x1 )(x \u2212 x2 )(x \u2212 x3 )}\np\nand P \u00b1 = (x0 , \u00b1 (x0 \u2212 x1 )(x0 \u2212 x2 )(x0 \u2212 x3 )).

The intersection number\nh\u03b4 + , \u03b4 \u2212 i equals +1 and it is easy to check that we may choose a canonical homology\nbasis \u03b41 (h), . . . , \u03b44 (h) of the lattice H1 (\u0393\u0304h , Z) such that \u03b41 (h) = \u03b4 + , \u03b43 (h) = \u03b4 \u2212 .\nFurther, let \u03c91 , \u03c92 be a normalized basis of holomorphic differentials on \u0393\u0304h .

Consider the\nRiemann theta function\nX \u221a\n\u221a\ne\u03c0 \u22121hm,Bmi+2\u03c0 \u22121hm,zi\n\u03b8(z) =\nm\u2208Z\n\n2\n\nand the corresponding theta divisor \u0398 = {z \u2208 J(\u0393\u0304h ) : \u03b8(z) = 0} where\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012 \u0013\na b\nz1\nB=\n, z=\n, hm, zi = m1 z1 + m2 z2 .\nc d\nz2\nBy the Riemann theorem, the divisor \u0398 is isomorphic to the curve \u0393\u0304h and in particular\nis irreducible. If \u2206(h) = 0, then b = c = 0 and \u03b8(z) factorizes into a product of two\nelliptic theta functions\nX \u221a\nX \u221a\n\u221a\n\u221a\n2\n2\n\u03b8(z) =\ne\u03c0 \u22121am1 +2\u03c0 \u22121m1 z1\ne\u03c0 \u22121dm2 +2\u03c0 \u22121m2 z2 .\nm1 \u2208Z\nm2 \u2208Z\nTherefore the Riemann theta divisor \u0398 is a product of the two elliptic curves (10)\nwhich is a contradiction. \u2737\n\n6\n\nConcluding remarks\n\nWe finish this paper with some general hypotheses concerning the zeros of the function\n\u03b10 I0 + \u03b11 I1 . In the previous section we demonstrated that this linear combination\n20\n\n\fbelongs to a Chebyshev space, provided that the continuous family of ovals {\u03b4(h)} is\nexceptional. In the non-exceptional case a big part of our proof still holds, provided\nthat \u03bb and \u03bc are real. This fact combined with the exact local result obtained in\nProposition 1 suggests the following more general statement.\nConjecture 1. Assume that the polynomial P (x) has distinct real critical values.\nThen the corresponding vector space of Abelian integrals \u03b10 I0 + \u03b11 I1 is Chebyshev\nwith accuracy at most one in D.\nOne may also ask whether the upper bound (two) for the number of the zeros near\nthe center always holds in the whole interval \u03a3 and next, whether the bounds for\nthe real zeros when h \u2208 \u03a3 and for the complex zeros when h belongs to a certain\ncomplex extension of \u03a3 do coincide. It turns out that the answers of all these questions\nare negative. In particular, we establish below that when P (x) has complex critical\nvalues, then there are three zeros in \u03a3 for appropriate \u03bb \u2208 C.\nOne can try to predict the possible number of real zeros by studying the behavior of\nthe ratio F (h) = I1 (h)/I0 (h) near the ends of the interval \u03a3. For reader's convenience,\nwe first recall some formulas.\nLet us take a continuous function f (x) and consider the integral\nZ\nf (x)dx\n, h\u2208\u03a3\nI(h) =\ny\n\u03b4(h)\nwhere \u03a3 = (hc , hs ) for the families O1 , O\u03bc and \u03a3 = (hs , h0 ) for the family Oe . Using\nPicard-Lefschetz formula or direct calculations of integrals, one can obtain the following asymptotical expansions in a neighborhood of the critical levels hs corresponding\nto a saddle or a cuspidal point (xs , 0):\n(i) For the saddle-loop and eight-loop cases,\nI(h) = \u2212cs f (xs ) log |h \u2212 hs | + \u03c6(h)\nwhere cs is a specific positive constant independent on f and \u03c6(h) is a continuous\nfunction in a neighborhood of hs . We are not going to write up the exact expression\nof cs since do not need it here.\n(ii) For the heteroclinic loop cases,\nI(h) = \u2212(c0 f (0) + cs f (xs )) log |h \u2212 hs | + \u03c6(h)\nwhere c0 , cs and \u03c6(h) are as above.\n(iii) For the cuspidal loop cases,\nI(h) = cs f (xs )|h \u2212 hs |\u22121/6 + \u03c6(h),\nwhere cs and \u03c6(h) are as above.\n(In fact, these formulas hold in a much more general context.) Applying the above\nexpansions to F (h), we get F (hs ) = xs /(1 + c0 /cs ) for the heteroclinic loop case and\n21\n\n\fF (hs ) = xs for all the remaining cases. Moreover, what concerns the saddle-loops,\nit is evident that F (h) \u2212 xs 6= 0 in \u03a3 and the sign of the expression depends on the\nposition of the saddle with respect to the family of ovals. Consider now the case of\nOe where the situation is more complicated. For h = h\u03bb , we obtain from (3) that\ny 2 = 25 (x \u2212 \u03bb)2 p(x),\n\np(x) = (x \u2212 x1 )(x \u2212 x2 )(x3 \u2212 x)\n\nwhere x1 < 0 < x2 \u2264 \u03bb \u2264 x3 and x2 , x3 are the left-most and the right-most points\nof the eight-loop (or the cuspidal loop, as a limit case). By (i)\u2013(iii), the function\n\u03c6(h) = I1 (h)\u2212\u03bbI0 (h) is continuous in a neighborhood of h\u03bb , which yields immediately\nthat\n\u0012 Z x3 Z \u03bb \u0013\n\u221a\ndx\np\n\u03c6(h\u03bb ) = 10\n.\n\u2212\np(x)\n\u03bb\nx2\np\n\u221a Rx\nClearly, \u03c6(h\u03bb ) \u2192 \u2212\u221e when x2 \u2192 x1 , \u03c6(h\u03bb ) \u2192 \u00b1 10 x23 dx/ p(x) when \u03bb \u2192 x2\nand \u03bb \u2192 x3 , respectively. As x2 = x1 is equivalent to h\u03bb = 0, \u03bb = x2 is equivalent to\n\u03bb = \u03bc and \u03bb = x3 is equivalent to \u03bb = 1, this means that the curve\n\u03b3s = {(\u03bb, \u03bc) \u2208 T : I1 (h\u03bb ) \u2212 \u03bbI0 (h\u03bb ) = 0}\nconnects the points (0, 0) and (1, 1) and lies in the part of T above \u03b3. Surprisingly,\nalthough expressed in terms of incomplete elliptic integrals, it turns out that \u03b3s is\na part of an algebraic curve of degree 6. This can be verified by transforming the\nintegrals to a standard form. From the explicit algebraic equation thus obtained it is\neasily seen that \u03b3s is a simple and connected curve (we omit the details). The curve\n\u03b3s is an element of the bifurcation diagram because for h close to h\u03bb , the function\nF (h) \u2212 \u03bb will change the sign when crossing \u03b3s in the parameter space.\nAmong other, the above analysis implies that for \u03bb = \u03bc, the function \u03b10 I0 +\u03b11 I1 =\nI0 (\u03b10 + \u03b11 F ) can have three zeros in (h1 , h\u03bb ) \u222a (h\u03bb , h0 ). Hence, the same fact remains\ntrue for O1 and the respective \u03a3 = (h1 , h0 ) in the complex case, at least for parameters\n\u03bb = a + ib with a \u2208 (0, 1) and |b| small. Based on the behavior of F near the other\nendpoint which corresponds to a center (see below), we conjecture that the domain\nin the parameter space \u03bb \u2208 C where the equation F (h) = const can have three real\nzeros, is surrounded by a curve on which they join into a triple zero.\nLooking at the bifurcation diagram again, let us denote by \u03b3c the curve\n\u03b3c = {(\u03bb, \u03bc) \u2208 T : \u03bb =\n\n3\u03bc2 \u22122\u03bc\n}\n2\u03bc\u22121\n\n(in the real case),\n\n\u03b3c = {\u03bb \u2208 C : |\u03bb \u2212 2| = 1} (in the complex case).\n\nFurther, let us denote by \u03b3 \u2217 the (hypothetical) curve\n\n\u03b3 \u2217 = {\u03bb \u2208 C : \u2203h\u2217 \u2208 \u03a3 with F \u2032 (h\u2217 ) = F \u2032\u2032 (h\u2217 ) = 0}.\nWe believe that \u03b3 \u2217 is a simple closed curve in the complex plane going through (0, 0)\nand (1, 0). On \u03b3 \u2217 , a bifurcation of a triple real zero into a simple one occurs.\nNext, in the real case, denote by \u03a9\u03bc the part of T placed between the curves \u03b3c\nand \u03b3, by \u03a9e the part of T placed between the curve \u03b3s and the line \u03bb = \u03bc and finally,\nin the complex case, denote by \u03a91 the unit disk inside \u03b3c and by \u03a9\u22171 the interior of \u03b3 \u2217\n(see figures 5 and 6).\n22\n\n\fIm\u03bb\n\u273b\n\n\u0393\n\n\u0393\n\n\u03a9\u22171\n\n\u03a91\n\n0\n\n\u2732\n\n1\n\n3\n\nRe\u03bb\n\n\u03b3c\n\n\u03b3\u2217\n\nFigure 5: Partition of the parameter space in the complex case \u03bb = \u03bc\u0304 \u2208 C.\nProposition 6 The vector spaces A\u03bc , Ae , A1 of Abelian integrals \u03b10 I0 + \u03b11 I1 corresponding to the continuous families of ovals O\u03bc for (\u03bb, \u03bc) \u2208 \u03a9\u03bc , Oe for (\u03bb, \u03bc) \u2208 \u03a9e ,\nand O1 for \u03bb \u2208 \u03a91 \u222a \u03a9\u22171 , are not Chebyshev in the respective intervals \u03a3.\nProof. The assertion follows from local analysis. Consider first O\u03bc . Then \u03a3 = (h\u03bc , 0)\nand F (h\u03bc ) = \u03bc > 0, F (0) = 0. By the proof of Proposition 1, we obtain that\nF \u2032 (h\u03bc ) > 0 is equivalent to a1 < 0. This coefficient is easily calculated from the\nnormal form (3) and the result is\na1 =\n\nP \u2032\u2032\u2032 (\u03bc)\n6\u03bc2 \u2212 4\u03bb\u03bc \u2212 4\u03bc + 2\u03bb\n=\n3P \u2032\u2032(\u03bc)\n3\u03bc(\u03bb \u2212 \u03bc)(1 \u2212 \u03bc)\n\nwhich proves the claim. The proof in the case of O1 is similar. The assertion for Oe\nfollows from the definition of \u03b3s . \u2737\nMaking use of the whole information about the local behavior of F near the\nendpoints of \u03a3, one can formulate the following hypothesis.\nConjecture 2. (i). The vector spaces A\u03bc , Ae are Chebyshev with accuracy one in\n\u03a3 for the cases considered in Proposition 6, and they are Chebyshev in \u03a3 for all the\nremaining cases.\n(ii). The vector space A1 is Chebyshev with accuracy one in \u03a3 for \u03bb \u2208 \u03a91 , it\nis Chebyshev with accuracy two in \u03a3 for \u03bb \u2208 \u03a9\u22171 and it is Chebyshev in \u03a3 for the\nremaining cases.\n(iii). Given \u03b10 and \u03b11 , the total number of zeros of the function \u03b10 I0 + \u03b11 I1\nrelative to all the period annuli is three and this bound is attained in \u03a9e \u222a \u03a9\u22171 .\n23\n\n\f\u273b\u03bc\n\n\u03b3s\n\n\u03a9e\n\u03b3\n\u03a9\u03bc\n\n\u03b3c\n\n\u03bb\n\n0\n\n\u2732\n\n1\nFigure 6: Partition of the parameter space in the real case \u03bb, \u03bc \u2208 R.\n\n24\n\n\fIt is plausible that Conjecture 2 is a consequence of Conjecture 1, except in the case\nwhen the polynomial P (x) has complex critical points.\nThe next problem in difficulty should be to study the space of Abelian integrals of\nthe first kind related to genus three hyperelliptic curves. We hope that this problem\ncan be settled by combining the methods of the present paper with deformation\narguments as in [16]. Properly understood, this might lead to the solution of the\nproblem for arbitrary genus g.\nAcknowledgments.
