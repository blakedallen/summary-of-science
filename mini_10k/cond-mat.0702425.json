Whenever one\ndeals with two or more energy branches, an interference\nof the corresponding upper and lower energy states results in the trembling motion even in the absence of external fields. Due to a formal similarity between two\ninteracting bands in a solid and the Dirac equation for\nrelativistic electron in a vacuum one can use methods\ndeveloped in the relativistic quantum mechanics for nonrelativistic electrons in solids [11, 12]. Most of the ZB\nstudies for semiconductors took as a starting point plane\nelectron waves (see, however, Refs. [5, 7, 13, 14]). On\nthe other hand, Lock [14] in his important paper observed: 'Such a wave is not localized and it seems to be\nof a limited practicality to speak of rapid fluctuations in\nthe average position of a wave of infinite extent.' Using\nthe Dirac equation Lock showed that, when an electron\nis represented by a wave packet, the ZB oscillations do\nnot remain undamped but become transient. In particular, the disappearance of oscillations at sufficiently large\ntimes is guaranteed by the Riemann-Lebesgue theorem as\nlong as the wave packet is a smoothly varying function.\nSince the ZB is by its nature not a stationary state but\na dynamical phenomenon, it is natural to study it with\nthe use of wave packets. These have become a practical\ninstrument when femtosecond pulse technology emerged\n(see Ref. [15]).\nIn the following we study theoretically the Zitterbewegung of mobile charge carriers in three modern materials:\nbilayer graphene, monolayer graphene and carbon nan-\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\naddress: Tomasz.Rusin@centertel.pl\n\notubes. We have three objectives in mind. First, we obtain for the first time analytical results for the ZB of gaussian wave packets which allows us to study not only the\ntrembling motion itself but also effects that accompany\nthis phenomenon. Second, we describe for the first time\nthe transient character of ZB in solids, testing on specific\nexamples the general predictions of Ref. [14]. Third, we\nlook for observable phenomena and select both systems\nand parameters which appear most promising for experiments. We first present our analytical results for bilayer\ngraphene and then quote some predictions for observable\nquantities in monolayer graphene and carbon nanotubes.\n\nII.\n\nBILAYER GRAPHENE\n\nTwo-dimensional Hamiltonian for bilayer graphene is\nwell approximated by [16]\n\u0124B = \u2212\n\n1\n2m\u2217\n\n\u0012\n\n0\n(px \u2212 ipy )2\n2\n(px + ipy )\n0\n\n\u0013\n\n,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere m\u2217 = 0.054m0. The form (1) is valid for energies 2 meV < E < 100 meV in the conduction\nband. The energy spectrum is E = \u00b1E, where E =\n~2 k 2 /2m\u2217 , i.e. there is no energy gap between the\nconduction and valence bands. The position operator\nin the Heisenberg picture is a 2 \u00d7 2 matrix x\u0302(t) =\nexp(i\u0124B t/~)x\u0302 exp(\u2212i\u0124B t/~). We calculate\n\u0014\n\u0012 2 \u0013\u0015\nky\n~k t\nx\u030211 (t) = x\u0302 + 2 1 \u2212 cos\n,\nk\nm\u2217\n\n(2)\n\nwhere k 2 = kx2 + ky2 . The third term represents the Zitterbewegung with the frequency ~\u03c9Z = 2~2 k 2 /2m\u2217 , corresponding to the energy difference between the upper\nand lower energy branches for a given value of k.\nWe want to calculate the ZB of a charge carrier repre-\n\n\f(4)\n\n~k0y\n.\nm\u2217 d\n\nwhere \u03b2\u0302 =\n\n\u0012\n\n1 0\n0 \u22121\n\n0.10\n\njx(t)\n\n0.05\n0.00\n\n-0.05\n\nb\n\n(5)\n\n(6)\n\n(7)\n\n\u0013\n, and the time-dependent wave\n\nProbability\n\n1.0\n\nFourth, as t (or \u03b4) increases the cosine term tends to unity\nand the first term in Eq. (5) cancels out with the second term, which illustrates the Riemann-Lebesgue theorem (see Ref. [14]). After the oscillations disappear, the\ncharge carrier is displaced by the amount x\u0304c , which is a\n'remnant' of ZB. Fifth, for very narrow packets (d \u2192 \u221e)\nthe exponent in Eq. (5) tends to unity, the oscillatory\n2\nterm is cos(\u03b4 2 k0y\n) and the last term vanishes. In this\nlimit we recover undamped ZB oscillations.\nNext, we consider observable quantities related to the\nZB, beginning by the current. The latter is given by\nthe velocity multiplied by charge. The velocity is simply\nv\u0304x = \u2202 x\u0304Z /\u2202t, where x\u0304Z is given by Eq. (5). The calculated current is plotted in Fig. 1b, its oscillations are a\ndirect manifestation of ZB. The Zitterbewegung is also\naccompanied by a time dependence of upper and lower\ncomponents of the wave function. To characterize this\nevolution we define probability densities for the upper\nand lower components\n1 \u00b1 \u03b2\u0302\nP\u00b1 (t) = h\u03c8(r, t)\n\u03c8(r, t)i,\n2\n\nx(t)\n\n-0.10\n\np\n~t/m\u2217 contains the time dependence.\nin which \u03b4 =\nWe enumerate the main features of ZB following from\nEqs. (4) and (5). First, in order to have the ZB in the\ndirection x one needs an initial transverse momentum\n~k0y . Second, the ZB frequency depends only weakly on\n2\nthe packet width: \u03c9Z = (~k0y\n/m\u2217 )(d4 /(d4 +\u03b4 4 ), while its\namplitude is strongly dependent on the width d. Third,\nthe ZB has a transient character, as it is attenuated by\nthe exponential term. For small t the amplitude of x\u0304Z (t)\ndiminishes as exp(\u2212\u03932Z t2 ) with\n\u0393Z =\n\n20\n\na\n\nP+\nP-\n\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n\nc\n\n0.0\n\n\u2206R(t) [A]\n\nx\u0304(t) = h\u03c8(r)|x\u0302(t)|\u03c8(r)i = x\u0304c + x\u0304Z (t)\n\u0002\n\u0003\n2\nwhere x\u0304c = (1/k0y ) 1 \u2212 exp(\u2212d2 k0y\n) , and\n!\n!\n\"\n2\n2\n\u03b4 4 d2 k0y\n\u03b4 2 d4 k0y\n1\nx\u0304Z (t) =\ncos\nexp \u2212 4\nk0y\nd + \u03b44\nd4 + \u03b4 4\n\u0003\n2\n\u2212 exp(\u2212d2 k0y\n) ,\n\n40\n\n0\n\njx(t) [pAm]\n\nsented by a two-dimensional wave packet\n\u0012 \u0013\nZ\n2\n1 d\n1\n\u2212 21 d2 (ky \u2212k0y )2 ikr\n2\n\u2212 21 d2 kx\n\u221a\n.\ne\nd ke\n\u03c8(r, 0) =\n0\n2\u03c0 \u03c0\n(3)\nThe packet is centered at k0 = (0, k0y ) and is characterized by a width d.

The time dependence of P\u00b1 (t) is illustrated in Fig. 1c. Clearly, there must be P+ (t)+ P\u2212 (t) =\n1 at any time, but it is seen that the probability density 'flows' back and forth between the two components.\nIt is clear that the oscillating probability is directly related to ZB. Since in bilayer graphene the upper and\n\n\f3\nlower components are associated with the first or second\nlayer, respectively [17], it follows that, at least for this\nsystem, the trembling motion represents oscillations of\na charge carrier between the two graphene layers. For\nsufficiently long times there is P\u00b1 = 1/2, so that the final probability is equally distributed between the two\nlayers. For a very narrow packet (d \u2192 \u221e) we have\n2\nP\u00b1 = (1/2)[1 \u00b1 cos2 (\u03b4 2 k0y\n)], which indicates that the\nprobability oscillates without attenuation. For k0y = 0\nthere is P\u00b1 = (1/2)[1 \u00b1 d4 /s4 ], i.e. there are no oscillations and the initial probability (1, 0) simply decays into\n(1/2, 1/2).\nThe above phenomenon can be considered from the\npoint of view of the entropy: S = \u2212P+ lg2 P+ \u2212P\u2212 lg2 P\u2212 .\nAt the beginning (the carrier is in one layer) the entropy\nis zero, at the end (when the probability is equally distributed in two layers) the entropy is lg2 2. However,\nthe entropy increases in the oscillatory fashion (see Ref.\n[18]).\nThe transient character of ZB is accompanied by a temporal spreading of the wave packet. In fact, the question\narises whether the damping of ZB is not simply caused\nby the spreading of the packet. To study this question\nwe calculate an explicit form of the wave function given\nby integrals (8).

It is\nseen that the packet, which was gaussian at t = 0 (see\nEq. (3)), is not gaussian at later times (see Discussion).\nThe upper and lower components have the same decay\ntime, oscillation period, etc. In order to characterize the\nspreading (or dispersion) of the packet we calculate its\nwidth \u2206R(t) as a function of time\n[\u2206R(t)]2 = h\u03c8(r, t)|r\u0302 2 \u2212 hr\u0302i2 |\u03c8(r, t)i,\n\n(12)\n\nwhere \u03c8(r, t) is the above two-component wave function\nand hr\u0302i = h\u03c8(r, t)|r\u0302|\u03c8(r, t)i. The calculated width \u2206R is\nplotted versus time in Fig. 1d. It is seen that during the\ninitial 80 femtoseconds the packet's width increases only\ntwice compared to its initial value, while the ZB and the\naccompanying effects disappear almost completely during this time. We conclude that the spreading of the\n\npacket is not the main cause of the transient character of\nthe ZB. In fact, also the spreading oscillates a little, but\nthis effect is too small to be seen in Fig. 1d.\nIt is well known that the phenomenon of ZB is due to\nan interference of wave functions corresponding to positive and negative eigen-energies of the initial Hamiltonian. Looking for physical reasons behind the transient\ncharacter of ZB described above, we decompose the total\nwave function \u03c8(r, t) into the positive (p) and negative\n(n) components \u03c8 p (r, t) and \u03c8 n (r, t). We have\n|\u03c8(t)i = e\u2212i\u0124t/~ |\u03c8(0)i\n\n= e\u2212iEt/~ hp|\u03c8(0)i|pi + eiEt/~ hn|\u03c8(0)i|ni, (13)\n\nwhere |pi and |ni are the eigen-functions of the Hamiltonian (1) in k space corresponding to positive and negative\nenergies, respectively.

(4). Thus\nthe integrals involving only the positive and only the negative components give the constant shift due to ZB, while\nthe mixed terms lead to the ZB oscillations. All terms\ntogether reconstruct the result (4).\nNext we calculate the average value \u0233. There is no\nsymmetry between x\u0304 and \u0233 because the wave packet is\ncentered around kx = 0 and ky = k0y . The average value\n\u0233 is again given by four integrals. However, now the\n\n\f4\nmixed terms vanish since they contain odd integrands of\nkx , while the integrals involving the positive and negative\ncomponents alone give\nZ\n~k0yt\n,\n(20)\n|\u03c8 p |2 yd2 r =\n2m\u2217\nZ\n~k0yt\n.\n(21)\n|\u03c8 n |2 yd2 r = \u2212\n2m\u2217\nThis means that the 'positive' and 'negative' subpackets\nmove in the opposite directions with the same velocity\nv = ~k0yt /2m\u2217 . The relative velocity is v rel = ~k0yt /m\u2217 .\nEach of these packets has the initial width d and it\nrel\n(slowly) spreads in time. After the time \u0393\u22121\nZ = d/v\nthe distance between the two packets equals d, so the\nintegrals (18) are small, resulting in the diminishing Zitterbewegung amplitude. This reasoning gives the decay\nconstant \u0393Z = ~k0yt /m\u2217 d, which is exactly what we determined above from the analytical results (see Eq. (6)).\nThus, the transient character of the ZB oscillations is\ndue to the increasing spacial separation of the subpackets\ncorresponding to the positive and negative energy states.\nThis confirms our previous conclusion that it is not the\npacket's slow spreading that is responsible for the attenuation (see Discussion). However, as we show below, also\nspreading may possibly play this role in some cases.\nTo conclude our analytical discussion of the ZB in bilayer graphene we consider an interesting property of the\nvelocity squared. If v\u0302x = \u2202 \u0124/\u2202 p\u0302x and v\u0302y = \u2202 \u0124/\u2202 p\u0302y are\ncalculated directly from the Hamiltonian (1), then it is\neasy to show that v\u0302x2 = ~2 k 2 /m2 and v\u0302y2 = ~2 k 2 /m2 , so\nthat v\u0302 2 = v\u0302x2 + v\u0302y2 = 2~2 k 2 /m2 does not depend on time.\nIn the Heisenberg picture we split the velocity components into 'classical' and ZB parts\n\u0013\n\u0012 2\n2\n~ky\nk sin(~k 2 t/m) \u2212ik+\ncos(~k 2 t/m)\nv\u0302xZ (t) =\n,\n2\ncos(~k 2 t/m) \u2212k 2 sin(~k 2 t/m)\nmk 2 ik\u2212\n\u0013\n\u0012\n2\n~kx\n0 k+\nv\u0302xc (t) =\n,\n(22)\n2\n2\nk\n0\nmk\n\u2212\nand similarly for v\u0302y (t). Noting that {v\u0302xZ (t), v\u0302xc (t)} = 0\nwe have v\u0302x (t)2 = v\u0302xZ (t)2 + v\u0302xc (t)2 . Using Eq. (22)\nwe show that each of these terms is time independent:\nv\u0302xZ (t)2 = ~2 ky2 /m2 and v\u0302xc (t)2 = ~2 kx2 /m2 , and similarly for v\u0302yZ (t)2 and v\u0302yc (t)2 . Thus, the velocity squared of\nthe ZB component v\u0302 Z (t)2 =v\u0302xZ (t)2 + v\u0302yZ (t)2 =~2 k 2 /m2 is\nequal to that of the 'classical' component v\u0302 c (t)2 =v\u0302xc (t)2 +\nv\u0302yc (t)2 =~2 k 2 /m2 .\nIII.\n\nMONOLAYER GRAPHENE\n\nNow we turn to monolayer graphene. The twodimensional band Hamiltonian describing its band structure is [19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24]\n\u0013\n\u0012\n0\npx \u2212 ipy\n,\n(23)\n\u0124M = u\npx + ipy\n0\n\nwhere u \u2248 1 \u00d7 108 cm/s. The resulting energy dispersion\nq is linear in momentum: E = \u00b1u~k, where k =\nkx2 + ky2 . The quantum velocity in the Schroedinger\npicture is v\u0302i = \u2202HM /\u2202 p\u0302i , it does not commute with the\nHamiltonian (23). In the Heisenberg picture we have\nv\u0302(t) = exp(i\u0124M t/~)v\u0302 exp(\u2212i\u0124M t/~). Using Eq. (23)\nwe calculate\nv\u0302x(11) = u\n\nky\nsin(2ukt).\nk\n\n(24)\n\nThe above equation describes the trembling motion with\nthe frequency \u03c9Z = 2uk, determined by the energy difference between the upper and lower energy branches for a\ngiven value of k. As before, the ZB in the direction x occurs only if there is a non-vanishing momentum ~ky . We\ncalculate an average velocity (or current) taken over the\nwave packet given by Eq. (3). The averaging procedure\namounts to a double integral. The latter is not analytical\nand we compute it numerically. The results for the current j\u0304x = ev\u0304x are plotted in Fig. 2 for k0y = 1.2\u00d7109m\u22121\nand different realistic packet widths d (see Ref. [25]). It\nis seen that the ZB frequency does not depend on d and\nis nearly equal to \u03c9Z given above for the plane wave. On\nthe other hand, the amplitude of ZB does depend on d\nand we deal with decay times of the order of femtoseconds. For small d there are almost no oscillations, for\nvery large d the ZB oscillations are undamped. These\nconclusions agree with our analytical results for bilayer\ngraphene. The behavior of ZB depends quite critically\non the values of k0y and d, which is reminiscent of the\ndamped harmonic oscillator.\nIV.\n\nCARBON NANOTUBES\n\nFinally, we consider monolayer graphene sheets rolled\ninto single semiconducting carbon nanotubes (CNT).\nThe band Hamiltonian in this case is similar to Eq. (23)\nexcept that, because of the periodic boundary conditions,\nthe momentum px is quantized and takes discrete values\n~kx = ~kn\u03bd , where kn\u03bd = (2\u03c0/L)(n\u2212\u03bd/3), n = 0, \u00b11, . . .,\n\u03bd = \u00b11, and L is the length of circumference of CNT\n[26, 27]. As a result, the free electron motion can occur\nonly in the direction y, parallel to the tube axis. The geometry of CNT has two important consequences. First,\nfor \u03bd = \u00b11 there always exists a non-vanishing value of\nthe quantized momentum ~kn\u03bd . Second, for each value\nof kn\u03bd there exists k\u2212n,\u2212\u03bd = \u2212kn\u03bd resulting in the same\nsubband energy E = \u00b1E, where\nq\n2 + k2 .\n(25)\nE = ~u kn\u03bd\ny\nThe time dependent velocity v\u0302y (t) and the displacement\n\u0177(t) can be calculated for the plane electron wave in\nthe usual way and they exhibit the ZB oscillations (see\nRef. [4]). For small momenta ky the ZB frequency is\n~\u03c9Z = Eg , where Eg = 2~ukn\u03bd .

The ZB oscillations of \u0233(t) are plotted in Fig. 3 for n = 0, \u03bd = \u00b11\nand L = 200 \u00c5. It can be seen that, after the transient ZB oscillations disappear, there remains a shift \u0233sh .\nThus the ZB separates spatially the charge carriers that\nare degenerate in energy but characterized by n, \u03bd and\n\u2212n, \u2212\u03bd quantum numbers. The current is proportional\nto v\u0304y = \u2202 \u0233/\u2202t, so that the currents related to \u03bd = 1\nand \u03bd = \u22121 cancel each other. To have a non-vanishing\ncurrent one needs to break the above symmetry, which\ncan be achieved by applying an external magnetic field\nparallel to the tube axis [4].\nAbove we considered the situation in which a nonvanishing value of transverse momentum ~kx is 'built\nin' by the tube topology. However, it is also possible\nto prepare a wave packet with an initial non-vanishing\nmomentum k0y .

At higher times the amplitude of ZB\noscillations decays as t\u22121/2 (see text).\n\nbilayer graphene (see Eq. (13)) we can decompose the\ntotal wave packet (26) into the positive and negative subpackets with the result\n\u0013\n\u0012\nZ\n2\nd1/2\n1 2\n1\n.\n\u03c8 p (y, t) = 3/2 3/4 dky e\u2212 2 d (ky \u2212k0y ) eiky y e\u2212iEt\nk+ /k\n2 \u03c0\n(28)\nThe function \u03c8 n (y, t) is given by a similar expression with\nthe changed signs in front\nqof E and (k+ /k) terms.

(27). The average contributions of positive (or\nnegative) terms alone are\nZ\n\np 2\n|\u03c8(n)\n| ydy =\n\n1\n\u0233c \u00b1 ut\n2\n\nZ\n\nky |F (ky )|2 dky\nq\n,\n2 + k2\n2 kn\u03bd\ny\n\n(30)\n\nwhere F (ky ) = d1/2 /(2\u03c0 1/4 ) exp(\u2212 12 d2 (ky \u2212 k0y )2 ) is the\npacket function. The sum of the first terms for \u03c8 p (y, t)\nand \u03c8 n (y, t) in Eq. (30) gives \u0233c , as before. For k0y = 0\nthe second term vanishes which physically means that\nthe relative velocity of the two subpackets is zero, so that\n\n\f6\nthey stay together in time. It is for this reason that the\ndecay of ZB is slow (see Fig. 3). If k0y 6= 0, the second\nterm in Eq. (30) does not vanish, the two subpackets run\naway from each other, their overlap diminishes and the\nZB disappears much more quickly.\nThe question remains: what is the physical reason for\nthe (slow) damping of the ZB electron shown in Fig. 3,\nif the subpackets stay together? (As we mentioned in\nthe Introduction, the mathematical expression for the\ndamping phenomenon is the Riemann-Lebesgue theorem.) Trying to answer this question we calculated the\nspreading of the wave subpackets (28) in time. For the\ninitial width \u2206y \u2248 90 \u00c5 the subpackets reach the width\n\u2206y \u2248 2600 \u00c5 after the time of 1000 fs (see Fig. 3).\nThus, we would be tempted to say that it is the spreading of the packets that is responsible for the attenuation\nof ZB. However, it should be noted that, while at higher\ntimes the packet's dispersion is linear in time (see Ref.\n[15] and Fig. 3d), the amplitude of ZB oscillations decays as t\u22121/2 . A similar slow damping of ZB occurs for\none-dimensional relativistic electrons in a vacuum if the\naverage momentum of the subpackets is zero (see Discussion).\n\nV.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nIt is of interest that the ZB phenomena similar to those\ndescribed above occur also for wave packets representing\nfree relativistic electrons in a vacuum governed by the\nDirac equation. This confirms again the strong similarity of the two-band models for non-relativistic electrons\nin solids to the description of free relativistic electrons in\na vacuum, see Refs. [3, 4, 7, 11, 12]. In contrast to bilayer graphene, the kinematics of the one-dimensional relativistic wave packets may not be described analytically,\nso the solutions were computed numerically and visualized graphically by Thaller [28]. It was shown that: 1) An\ninitial relativistic gaussian wave packet after spreading is\nnot gaussian any more. This is analogous to our Eqs.\n(10) and (11). 2) If an average momentum of the initial\npositive and negative subpackets is zero, the overlap of\nthe two subpackets remains almost constant in time and\nthe resulting ZB decays quite slowly. This corresponds to\nour considerations of CNT with k0y = 0, see Fig. 3. (It\nis to be reminded that the two overlapping subpackets\nare orthogonal to each other.) 3) If the initial average\nmomentum of both subpackets is nonzero, the two subpackets quickly run away from each other and the ZB\nfalls quickly since it is sustained only when the subpackets have some overlap in the position space. This corresponds to our considerations of bilayer graphene, see Fig.\n1.\nThe transient ZB of free relativistic wave packets in\na vacuum was also studied numerically by Braun et al.\n[29]. It was shown that, for example, the decay times\nof a typical wave packet having the width \u2206x = \u03bbc and\nthe initial wave vector k0x = 1.37 a.u. is 2.4 \u00d7 10\u22125 fs.\n\nThis should be compared with our predicted decay times\n\u22121\nof \u0393Z\n= 40 fs for bilayer graphene. It turns out once\nagain that solids are much more promising media for an\nobservation of Zitterbewegung than a vacuum.\nThe Zitterbewegung phenomenon described above\nshould not be confused with the Bloch oscillations of\ncharge carriers in superlattices, although the latter occur\nat picosecond frequencies and have comparable picoseconds decay times (see e.g. Refs. [30, 31, 32]). However, the Bloch oscillations are basically a one-band phenomenon, they have been realized in superlattices (although this is in principle not the condition sine qua non)\nand, most importantly, they require an external electric\nfield driving electrons all the way to the Brillouin zone\nboundary. On the other hand, the ZB needs at least two\nbands and it is a no-field phenomenon. On the other\nhand, narrow-gap superlattices could provide a suitable\nmedium of its observation.\nIn view of our results it is clear that, in order to observe\nthe transient Zitterbewegung, it is necessary to prepare\nsimultaneously a sufficient number of charge carriers in\nthe form of wave packets. If one wants to detect the\ncurrent, the trembling motion of all carriers must have\nthe same phase. On the other hand, if one wants to see\nonly the remnant displacement, the phase coherence is\nnot necessary. As we said above, the ZB frequency is to\na good accuracy given by the corresponding energy difference between the upper and lower energy branches while\nthe amplitude depends strongly on packet's width. For\nthe two graphene materials considered above one needs\nan initial momentum in one direction to have the ZB\nalong the transverse direction (see also Ref. [5]). For\nnanotubes the initial momentum is automatically there\ndue to the circular boundary conditions. The oscillatory\nmotion between two graphene layers, as illustrated in Fig.\n1c, appears to be a promising phenomenon for observation. As far as the detection is concerned, one needs\nsensitive current meters or scanning probe microscopy,\nboth working at infrared frequencies and femtosecond to\npicosecond decay times (see Refs. [33, 34]).\n\nVI.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nIn summary, using the two-band structure of bilayer\ngraphene, monolayer graphene and carbon nanotubes we\nshow that charge carriers in these materials, localized in\nthe form of gaussian wave packets, exhibit the transient\nZitterbewegung with the decay times of femtoseconds in\ngraphene and picoseconds in nanotubes. Observable dynamical ZB effects, most notably the electric current, are\ndescribed. It is demonstrated that, after the trembling\nmotion disappears, there remains its 'trace' in the form of\na persistent charge displacement. It is emphasized that\nthe described ZB in solids is in close analogy to that of\nthe relativistic electron in a vacuum.\n\n\f7\nAcknowledgments\n\nby the Polish Ministry of Sciences, Grant No PBZ-MIN008/P03/2003.\n\nWe acknowledge elucidating discussions with Professor\nI.
