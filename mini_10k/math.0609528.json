Throughout the paper, K[x] = K[x1 , . . . , xn ]\ndenotes the ring of polynomials in n variables over the field K = R or\nC. For an ideal I \u2286 K[x], VC (I) := {x \u2208 Cn | f (x) = 0 \u2200f \u2208 I} and\nVR (I) := VC (I) \u2229 Rn denote, respectively, the complex and real varieties of\nI and, for V \u2286 Cn , I(V ) := {f \u2208 K[x] | f (v) = 0 \u2200v \u2208 V } is the vanishing\n\u221a\nideal of the set V . The ideal I(VC (I)) coincides with the radical ideal I\nof\nI by the Nullstellensatz and I(VR (I)) coincides with the real radical ideal\n\u221a\nR\nI by the Real Nullstellensatz (see Section 2.1 for details). The problem of\nfinding the radical ideal I(VC (I)) seems to be much better understood than\nthat of finding the real radical ideal I(VR (I)); see below for a brief recap\non existing literature. In this paper, we provide a new characterization of\n1\n\nLAAS-CNRS and Institute of Mathematics, Toulouse, France. lasserre@laas.fr.\nSupported by the french national research agency ANR under grant NT05-3-41612\n2\nCentrum voor Wiskunde en Informatica, Kruislaan 413, 1098 SJ Amsterdam, Netherlands.

In addition, from this characterization, we also define a numerical\nalgorithm based on semidefinite programming to compute the points of the\n(finite) variety VR (I) as well as a set of generators of the real radical ideal\nI(VR (I)). More generally, our results extend to the case of the so-called\nS-radical ideal I(VR (I) \u2229 S) where S \u2286 Rn is defined by finitely many polynomial inequalities, assuming that VR (I) \u2229 S is finite. It turns out that\na similar algorithm also works for computing VC (I) and the radical ideal\nI(VC (I)) (assuming now VC (I) finite) although very good methods already\nexist for this latter case. In the remainder of the Introduction, after recalling some motivation and related literature on the problem of finding the\n(real) radical ideal, we sketch the main ingredients of our method. We already introduce some definitions but refer to Sections 2 and 3 for additional\ndefinitions about polynomials and moment matrices.\nMotivation. The main motivation of this work is to provide a characterization as well as an algorithm for finding the real variety and the real radical of\nan ideal I \u2286 R[x] that takes into account the specific real algebraic geometric nature of the problem. Indeed, to the best of our knowledge, most basic\nmethods for computing the real variety VR (I) first compute the complex\nvariety VC (I); for this they require as basic ingredients a Gr\u00f6bner basis of I\nand a linear basis of the vector space R[x]/I and thus they work under the\nassumption that VC (I) is finite. Even if VC (I) is finite but has many more\ncomplex elements than real ones, this may produce a large computational\noverhead. This is particularly important as the numbers of complex and real\nsolutions may differ significantly as supported by the fewnomial theory of\nKhovanski [22]; see also the discussion in Bihan et al. [4], [5]. In other words,\nthis problem of real algebraic geometry is solved via algebraic methods that\ndo not take into account right from the beginning the real algebraic aspect\nof the problem. In contrast, our characterization and our algorithm do not\nneed knowledge of a Gr\u00f6bner basis of I and are real algebraic in nature, as\nwe never compute any complex zero.\nRelated literature.\nThere is a large literature on the problem of finding the\n\u221a\nradical ideal I of an ideal I; see, e.g., [3], [8], [17], [19], [23], [24]. For the\ngeneral (positive-dimensional) case, Krick and Logar [23] propose an efficient\nalgorithm based on splitting and reduction to the zero-dimensional case,\nwhich is implemented e.g. in the computer algebra package Singular [18].\nIn the zero-dimensional case the problem is considered\nto be well-solved, e.g.,\n\u221a\nvia the following method of Seidenberg [37]: I = hI \u222a {q1 , . . . , qn }i, the\nideal generated by I and the qi 's, where qi is the square-free part of the monic\ngenerator pi of I \u2229 K[xi ]. Finding pi is easy once a linear basis B of K[x]/I is\nknown. Namely, find the smallest integer ki for which {1, xi , x2i , . . . , xki i } is\nlinearly dependent in K[x]/I; then this smallest linear dependence gives the\n2\n\n\fpolynomial pi . Next, the polynomial qi can be found taking derivatives and\npi\ngcd-computations as qi = gcd(p\n\u2032 . So finding I(VC (I)) is easy if we have a\ni ,pi )\nbasis of K[x]/I. A classical method for finding such a basis B is to compute\na Gr\u00f6bner basis of I and the corresponding set B of standard monomials.\nThe results in the present paper show that one may alternatively find such\na basis B from a suitable moment matrix.\nOn the other hand, the problem of computing the real radical ideal is\nconsidered to be much more difficult. For instance, in their paper which\nis one of the first classical references on this problem, Becker and Neuhaus\n[1, p. 7] write that the computation of \u03c4 -real parts (thus, the real radical\nideal) is much more\ndifficult (than that of the ordinary radical). They give\n\u221a\nR\nan algorithm\nfor I based on finding the minimal real prime ideals Pi such\n\u221a\nthat R I = \u2229i Pi . Among other advanced algebraic manipulations, their\nalgorithm makes intensively use of (ordinary) radical computations. For\nother works along similar lines see, e.g., [2], [9].\nFinally, let us mention that excellent algorithms and software packages\nexist for computing the complex variety VC (I) of a zero-dimensional ideal I,\ne.g., by Verschelde [44], Rouillier [36]; see also related work by Mourrain et\nal. [32] and e.g. the monograph [16]. For instance, Verschelde [44] proposes\nsymbolic-numeric algorithms via homotopy continuation methods (cf. also\n[38]) whereas Rouillier [36] solves a zero-dimensional system of polynomials\nby giving a rational univariate representation (RUR) for its solutions, of the\nn (t)\n1 (t)\n, . . ., xn = gg(t)\n, where f, g, g1 , . . . , gn \u2208 K[t] are\nform f (t) = 0, x1 = gg(t)\nunivariate polynomials. The computation of the RUR relies in an essential\nway on the multiplication matrices in the quotient algebra K[x]/I which\nthus requires the knowledge of a corresponding linear basis.\nOur contribution. Given an ideal I \u2286 K[x] (K = R, C) defined by a set of\ngenerators and satisfying |VK (I)| < \u221e, we provide a method for computing\nVK (I) as well as a border basis and a Gr\u00f6bner basis of the ideal I(VK (I)).\nOur approach is based on a semidefinite programming characterization of\nI(VK (I)) with the following distinguished feature. Remarkably, all information needed to compute the above objects is contained in the so-called\nmoment matrix (whose entries depend on the polynomials generating the\nideal I) and the geometry behind it when this matrix is required to be positive semidefinite with maximum rank. The latter property is achieved by\nstandard semidefinite programming algorithms. For the task of computing\nthe real roots and the real radical ideal I(VR (I)), the method is real algebraic in nature, as we do not compute (implicitly or explicitly) any complex\nelement of VC (I).\nLasserre [25] already recognized that moment matrices can be used for\napproximating the minimum of a polynomial over a basic closed semi-algebraic\nset and sometimes extracting global minimizers (cf. [21]). The present paper\nbuilds on this approach and shows how it can be applied to finding the real\n3\n\n\fradical of a zero-dimensional ideal. Moreover there are links between moment matrices and the Hermite quadratic forms used in [33] for computing\nthe number of real roots, that were pointed out in [28].\nOur approach with its specificity is best illustrated on the task of computing the real radical ideal I(VR (I)) that we now briefly describe.\nn\n\nGiven a sequence y = (y\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208Nn \u2208 RN , consider the moment matrix\nM R (y) := (y\u03b1+\u03b2 )\u03b1,\u03b2\u2208Nn\n(later we will also introduce complex moment matrices M C (y), M 2C (y)).\nOne may think that y and M R (y) are indexed by the set Tn := {x\u03b1 | \u03b1 \u2208 Nn }\nof monomials. Given a polynomial h \u2208 R[x], set vec(h) := (h\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208Nn and\nn\ndefine the new sequence hy := M R (y)vec(h) \u2208 RN . By abuse of language let\nus say that h lies in the kernel of M R (y) when vec(h) does, which enables us\nto view KerM R (y) as a subset of R[x]. The following property of moment\nmatrices plays a central role in our approach; it is based on ideas from\n[12],[13],[27] and will be proved at the end of Section 3. Let I = hh1 , . . . , hm i\nbe an ideal generated by h1 , . . . , hm \u2208 R[x].\nProposition 1.1. Assume that VR (I) is finite. If\nM R (y) \u0017 0, M R (hj y) = 0 (j = 1, . . . , m)\n\n(1.1)\n\nthen the kernel of M R (y) is a real radical ideal, rankM R (y) \u2264 |VR (I)| and\nI(VR (I)) \u2286 KerM R (y), with equality if and only if M R (y) has maximum\nrank, equal to |VR (I)|.\n(In (1.1) the notation \"\u0017 0\" stands for positive semidefinite.) This semidefinite characterization leads directly to an algorithm for computing I(VR (I)),\nby considering truncated moment matrices in place of the full (infinite) moment matrix M R (y). Namely, given an integer t, let MtR (y) denote the\nprincipal submatrix of M R (y) whose P\nrows and columns are indexed by the\n\u03b1\nn\nset Tn,t := {x | \u03b1 \u2208 N with |\u03b1| := i \u03b1i \u2264 t} and set\ndj := \u2308deg(hj )/2\u2309, d := max dj .\nj=1,...,m\n\n(1.2)\n\nFix t \u2265 d and assume MtR (y) is a maximum rank matrix satisfying\nR\n(hj y) = 0 (j = 1, . . . , m).\nMtR (y) \u0017 0, Mt\u2212d\nj\n\n(1.3)\n\nWe will show that if, moreover,\nR\nrankMsR (y) = rankMs\u2212d\n(y)\n\n(1.4)\n\nfor some d \u2264 s \u2264 t, then I(VR (I)) coincides with the ideal generated by\nKerMsR (y). The same conclusion holds if\nR\nrankMsR (y) = rankMs\u22121\n(y)\n\n4\n\n(1.5)\n\n\ffor some 2d \u2264 s \u2264 t. Moreover, from the semidefinite characterizations\n(1.3)-(1.5), the following algebraic objects can be obtained directly from the\nmatrix MtR (y):\n(i) Let B \u2286 Tn,s be a set indexing a maximum nonsingular principal submatrix of MsR (y). Then B is a linear basis of the quotient vector space\nR[x]/I(VR (I)) (see Section 3.3).\n(ii) We can compute directly from MtR (y) the matrix of any multiplication operator in R[x]/I(VR (I)) with respect to the basis B, and thus\ncompute VR (I) (using the eigenvalue method, see Section 2.2).\n(iii) When the set B (as in (i)) is an order ideal (i.e., is stable under division), the matrices of the multiplication operators by x1 , . . . , xn give\ndirectly a border basis of the ideal I(VR (I)) (see Section 2.5).\n(iv) Given a graded lexicographic monomial ordering, we can find a set\nB (as in (i)) which is precisely the set of standard monomials; the\nassociated reduced Gr\u00f6bner basis of I(VR (I)) can then be recovered,\nsince it is contained in the border basis. In fact our method also applies\nto an arbitrary monomial ordering (see Section 4.4.5).\n(v) Finally the method can also detect whether the real variety VR (I) is\nempty. Indeed, VR (I) = \u2205 if and only if, for some integer t, the system\n(1.3) admits no solution y with y0 6= 0. (See Remark 4.8.)\nFurther discussion. An independence oracle in R[x]/I(VR (I)) is needed\nfor our algorithm in (iv) above. The following property is a crucial ingredient. Assume that one of the conditions (1.4) or (1.5) holds and consider a\nset T \u2286 Tn,s . Then, T is linearly independent in R[x]/I(VR (I)) if and only\nif T indexes a linearly independent set of columns of MtR (y). In view of (iv),\na Gr\u00f6bner basis can easily be derived afterwards in contrast with classical\nmethods which compute the set of standard monomials from the Gr\u00f6bner\nbasis.\nRealizing the above tasks relies only on numerical linear algebraic operations on MtR (y) like evaluating the rank of certain principal submatrices.\nFinding a matrix satisfying (1.3) is an instance of semidefinite programming.\nMoreover, it is a property of most interior-point algorithms for semidefinite\nprogramming that they do find such a matrix having maximum rank (see\nSection 4.4.1 for details).\nThe method is iterative. Namely, if the maximum rank matrix satisfying\n(1.3) does not satisfy (1.4) or (1.5), then we iterate with t + 1 in place of t.\nThe method eventually terminates since we will show that (1.4) holds for t\nlarge enough.\nThe following two small examples illustrate how positive semidefiniteness\nof the matrix MtR (y) allows the elimination of all complex (nonreal) roots,\n5\n\n\fwhose number can be much larger than the number of real roots or even\ninfinite.\nExample 1.2 Let I \u2286 R[x] be generated by hi = xi (x2i + 1) (i = 1, .., n).\nThen, VR (I) = {0}, |VC (I)| = 3n , di = 2 for all i. Assume y satisfies (1.3)\nfor order t = 3. Then M1R (hi y) = 0 implies y4ei = \u2212y2ei and M3R (y) \u0017 0\nimplies y2ei , y4ei \u2265 0 which in turn implies y\u03b1 = 0 for all \u03b1 6= 0 with |\u03b1| \u2264 5.\n(Throughout, e1 , . . . , en denote the standard unit vectors in Rn .) Hence\nrankM2R (y) = rankM0R (y) = 1; that is, (1.4) holds for s = 2. In fact,\nKerM1R (y) is spanned by x1 , . . . , xn , the generators of I(VR (I)). One may\nargue that the ideal I is already described by a Gr\u00f6bner basis. But the same\nconclusion also holds under the change of variables x = Ay with A being a\nnonsingular matrix, in which case other methods would require a Gr\u00f6bner\nbasis computation.\nExample 1.3 Let I \u2286 R[x1 , x2 ] be generated by h = x21 +x22 . Then VR (I) =\n{0} and VC (I) = {(x1 , x2 ) | x1 = \u00b1ix2 } is infinite. Then M0R (hy) = 0 gives\ny2e1 + y2e2 = 0 which, together with M1R (y) \u0017 0, implies y\u03b1 = 0 for \u03b1 6= 0.\nHence the maximum rank of M1R (y) is equal to 1 and KerM1R (y) is spanned\nby x1 , x2 , the generators of I(VR (I)).\nThe method sometimes (partially) applies even if none of the rank conditions (1.4), (1.5) holds, namely when MtR (y) contains sufficient information for the construction of the (formal) multiplication matrices. More precisely, let MtR (y) be a maximum rank matrix satisfying (1.3), let B \u2286 Tn,t\nindex a maximum nonsingular principal submatrix of MtR (y), set \u2202B :=\n(\u222ani=1 xi B) \\ B, and assume that the two principal submatrices of MtR (y)\nindexed by B and by B \u222a \u2202B have the same rank. Then, by the results of\nKehrein, Kreuzer and Robbiano [16, Ch. 4], we can construct the formal\nmultiplication matrices and, if they commute pairwise, a set W \u2287 VR (I) can\nbe computed. By checking whether the points of W satisfy all the equations\nhj = 0, we can eliminate the points in W \\ VR (I). It turns out that, for\nmost examples we have tested, W = VR (I) holds and we are again able to\nfind I(VR (I) together with a border basis generating this ideal.\nFinally, the method also applies to the task of finding the radical ideal\nI(VC (I)) of a zero-dimensional ideal I \u2286 C[x]. For this, instead of using\nthe matrix MtR (y) where y is a real sequence indexed by Tn,t, we have to\nuse a matrix Mt2C (y) where the argument is a complex sequence indexed by\nT2n,t (see Section 3.1 for details). Similar results hold as in the real case.\nNamely, under certain rank conditions, the ideal I(VC (I)) can be obtained\nas the ideal generated by the kernel of a maximum rank complex moment\nmatrix (see Section 4.3 for details). However, a drawback in the complex\ncase is that one must in general handle matrices of larger order which leads\nto larger semidefinite programs, thus more difficult to solve. However, so\nfar we do not claim that our method can compete with existing methods for\n6\n\n\ffinding the complex variety VC (I) as e.g. [36], or [44], especially in view of\nthe present status of SDP solvers (that we use as a black box), still in their\ninfancy.\nContents of the paper. Section 2 contains preliminaries about ideals of\npolynomials, in particular, about the quotient ring K[x]/I, multiplication\nmatrices, Gr\u00f6bner bases and border bases. We also indicate in Section 2.4\nan algorithm for finding the set of standard monomials from an independence\noracle in K[x]/I. Section 3 contains preliminaries about moment matrices,\nin particular, results relating (real) radical ideals and kernels of positive\nsemidefinite moment matrices. In Section 4, we prove the main results about\nthe semidefinite characterization of the variety VK (I) and the associated\nradical ideal I(VK (I)). Section 4.4 gives the details and implementation\nof an algorithm based on the semidefinite characterization, and Section 5\ncontains several examples illustrating its behaviour.\n\n2\n\nPreliminaries on Polynomial Ideals\n\n2.1\n\nPolynomial ideals and varieties\n\nThroughout, K = R or C, and K[x] := K[x1 , . . . , xn ] denotes the ring of\nmultivariate polynomials in n variables over the field K. For an integer\nt \u2265 0, K[x]t denotes the set of polynomials of degree at most t. For a scalar\na \u2208 C, \u0101 denote its complex conjugate and, for a vector u \u2208 Cn (resp., a\nmatrix A), u\u2217 (resp., A\u2217 ) denotes its conjugate transpose. Following e.g.\n[10], x\u03b1 denotes the monomial x\u03b11 1 * * * x\u03b1nn (for \u03b1 \u2208 Nn ) and cx\u03b1 is called a\nterm (for c \u2208 K). Let Tn := {x\u03b1P| \u03b1 \u2208 Nn } denote the set of monomials\nand set Nnt := {\u03b1 \u2208 Nn | |\u03b1| := ni=1 \u03b1i \u2264 t}, Tn,t := {x\u03b1 | \u03b1 \u2208 Nnt } for\nt \u2208 N. Following [16, Ch. 4], a set B \u2286 Tn is called an order ideal if B is\nstable under division, i.e., for all a, b \u2208 Tn , b \u2208 B, a|b implies a \u2208 B. Given\nan ideal4 I \u2286 K[x], let\nVC (I) := {x \u2208 Cn | f (x) = 0 \u2200f \u2208 I}, VR (I) := VC (I) \u2229 Rn\ndenote its complex and real varieties, respectively. For a set V \u2286 Kn , define\nthe ideal\nI(V ) := {f \u2208 K[x] | f (v) = 0 \u2200v \u2208 V }.\nGiven an ideal I \u2286 K[x], one can define the ideals I(VC (I)) and\n\u221a\nI := {f \u2208 K[x] | f m \u2208 I for some m \u2208 N \\ {0}}\n4\n\nAn ideal I \u2286 K[x] is an additive subgroup of K[x] such that f g \u2208 I whenever f \u2208 I\nand g \u2208 K[x].\n\n7\n\n\fand, when I \u2286 R[x], one can define the ideals I(VR (I)) and\nX\n\u221a\nR\nI := {p \u2208 R[x] | p2m +\nqj2 \u2208 I for some qj \u2208 R[x], m \u2208 N \\ {0}}.\nj\n\nObviously,\nI\u2286\n\n\u221a\n\nI \u2286 I(VC (I)), I \u2286\n\n\u221a\nR\n\nI \u2286 I(VR (I)).\n\u221a\n\u221a\nThe ideal I is said to be radical (resp., real radical) if I = I (resp., I = R I).\nObviously, I \u2286 I(VC (I)) \u2286 I(VR (I)). Hence, if I \u2286 R[x] is real radical, then\nI is radical and moreover, VC (I) = VR (I) \u2286 Rn if |VR (I)| < \u221e. The following\nlemma gives a useful characterization for (real) radical ideals.\nLemma 2.1. An ideal I \u2286 K[x] is radical if and only if\n\u2200p \u2208 K[x],\n\np2 \u2208 I =\u21d2 p \u2208 I\n\n(2.1)\n\nand I \u2286 R[x] is real radical if and only if\n\u2200p1 , . . . , pk \u2208 R[x],\n\np21 + . . . + p2k \u2208 I =\u21d2 p1 , . . . , pk \u2208 I.\n\n(2.2)\n\nProof.\nIf I is radical, then (2.1) obviously holds. Conversely assume\nthat (2.1) holds; we show that pm \u2208 I =\u21d2 p \u2208 I by induction on m \u2265 2. If\npm \u2208 I then pm+1 \u2208 I and thus, by (2.1), p\u2308m/2\u2309 \u2208 I which, by the induction\nassumption, implies p \u2208 I. The proof for the real radical case is along the\nsame lines and thus omitted.\n\u0003\n\u221a\nTheorem 2.2. (i) Hilbert's Nullstellensatz (see, e.g., [10, \u00a74.1]) I =\nI(VC (I)).\n\u221a\n(ii) Real Nullstellensatz (see, e.g., [7, \u00a74.1]) R I = I(VR (I)) for an ideal\nI \u2286 R[x].\nP\nFor a polynomial p \u2208 R[x], x 7\u2192 p(x) = \u03b1 p\u03b1 x\u03b1 , let vec(p) := (p\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208Nn\ndenote the vector of its coefficients. We also let vec(p) denote the vector\n(p\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208Nnt for any t \u2265 deg(p), as p\u03b1 = 0 whenever |\u03b1| > deg(p).\nP\nFinally, given A \u2286 K[x], let hAi := { ki=1 ui pi | pi \u2208 A, ui \u2208 K[x]}\ndenote the ideal generated by A.\n\n2.2\n\nThe algebra K[x]/I and multiplication matrices\n\nConsider the quotient space K[x]/I, whose elements are the cosets [f ] :=\nf + I = {f + q | q \u2208 I} for f \u2208 K[x]. K[x]/I is a K-vector space with\naddition [f ] + [g] := [f + g] and scalar multiplication \u03bb[f ] := [\u03bbf ], and\nan algebra with multiplication [f ][g] := [f g], for \u03bb \u2208 K, f, g \u2208 K[x]. In\nparticular, for h \u2208 K[x], the multiplication operator\n\u2212\u2192 K[x]/I\n7\u2212\u2192\n[hf ]\n\nmh : K[x]/I\n[f ]\n8\n\n\fis well defined. The following well known result relates the cardinality of\nVC (I) and the dimension of the vector space K[x]/I. See e.g. [10], [40] for a\ndetailed treatment of the quotient algebra K[x]/I.\nTheorem 2.3. For an ideal I in K[x], |VC (I)| < \u221e \u21d0\u21d2 dim K[x]/I < \u221e.\nMoreover, |VC (I)| \u2264 dim K[x]/I, with equality if and only if I is radical.\nAssume |VC (I)| < \u221e and set N := dim K[x]/I \u2265 |VC (I)|. Consider a\nset B := {b1 , . . . , bN } \u2286 K[x] for which the cosets [b1 ], . . . , [bN ] are pairwise\ndistinct and {[b1 ], . . . , [bN ]} is a basis of K[x]/I; by abuse of language we also\nsay that B itself is a basis\nPNof K[x]/I. Then every f \u2208 K[x] can be written\nin a unique way as f = i=1 ci bi + p, where ci \u2208 K, p \u2208 I; the polynomial\nPN\nresB (f ) :=\nI w.r.t. the basis\ni=1 ci bi is called the residue of f modulo\nPN\nB. In other words, the vector space SpanK (B) := { i=1 ci bi | ci \u2208 K} is\nisomorphic to K[x]/I.\nGiven a basis B of K[x]/I and h \u2208 K[x], let Xh denote the matrix of the\nmultiplication operator mh with respect to B. That is, writing resB (hbj ) =\nPN\nN\ni=1 aij bi , the jth column of Xh is the vector (aij )i=1 . The following well\nknown result relates the points of the variety VC (I) to the eigenvalues and\neigenvectors of Xh . See, e.g., [16, Ch. 2,3] for a detailed treatment.\nTheorem 2.4. Let h \u2208 K[x] and, for v \u2208 VC (I), set \u03b6B,v := (bi (v))N\ni=1 . The\nT\nset {h(v) | v \u2208 VC (I)} is the set of eigenvalues of Xh and Xh \u03b6B,v = h(v)\u03b6B,v\nfor all v \u2208 VC (I).\nWhen the matrix Xh is non-derogatory (i.e., all its eigenspaces are 1-dimensional),\none can recover the points v \u2208 VC (I) from the eigenvectors of XhT . If I is radical, then N = |VC (I)| and thus Xh is non-derogatory whenever the values\nh(v) (v \u2208 VC (I)) arePpairwise distinct. This is achieved with high probability\nif one chooses h = ni=1 ai xi for random scalars ai .\n\n2.3\n\nGr\u00f6bner bases and standard monomials\n\nA classical basis of K[x]/I is the set of standard monomials with respect to\nsome monomial ordering '\u227b' of Tn . Let us recall some definitions. (See e.g.\n\u03b1 \u227b bx\u03b2\n[10] for details.) Fix a monomial ordering \u227b on Tn . Write also ax\nP\nif x\u03b1 \u227b x\u03b2 and a, b \u2208 K \\ {0}. For a nonzero polynomial f = \u03b1 f\u03b1 x\u03b1 ,\nits leading term LT(f ) is the maximum f\u03b1 x\u03b1 with respect to \u227b for which\nf\u03b1 6= 0. The leading term ideal of I is LT(I) := hLT(f ) | f \u2208 Ii and the set\nB\u227b := Tn \\ LT(I) = {x\u03b1 | LT(f ) does not divide x\u03b1 \u2200f \u2208 I}\nis the set of standard monomials. Obviously B\u227b is an order ideal. A finite\nset G \u2286 I is a Gr\u00f6bner basis of I if LT(I) = hLT(g) | g \u2208 Gi; thus x\u03b1 \u2208 B\u227b\nif and only if x\u03b1 is not divisible by the leading term of any polynomial\nin G. A Gr\u00f6bner basis always exists and it can be constructed, e.g., with\n9\n\n\fthe algorithm of Buchberger. Call G reduced if, for all g \u2208 G, the leading\ncoefficient of LT(g) is 1 and no term of g lies in hLT (g\u2032 ) | g\u2032 \u2208 G \\ {g}i.\nGiven nonzero polynomials f, h1 , . . . , hm , the division algorithm applied to\ndividing f by h1 , . . . , hm produces polynomials u1 , . . . , um , r satisfying f =\nP\nm\nj=1 uj hj +r, no term of r is divisible by LT(hj ) (j = 1, . . . , m) and LT(f ) \u0017\nLT(uj hj ). Note that deg(ui hi ) \u2264 deg(f ) when the monomial ordering is a\ngraded lexicographic ordering. When {h1 , . . . , hm } is a Gr\u00f6bner basis of the\nideal I := hh1 , . . . , hm i, the remainder r is uniquely determined and belongs\nto SpanK (B\u227b ); moreover, f \u2208 I \u21d0\u21d2 r = 0. Therefore, the set B\u227b is a basis\nof K[x]/I.\nFor an arbitrary basis B of K[x]/I, set dB := maxb\u2208B deg(b). The next\nresult shows that dB is minimum when B is the set of standard monomials\nfor some graded lexicographic order.\nLemma 2.5. Let I be a zero-dimensional ideal in K[x]. Let {g1 , . . . , gk }\nbe the Gr\u00f6bner basis of I with respect to a graded lexicographic monomial\nordering and let B\u227b be the corresponding set of standard monomials. For\nany basis B of K[x]/I, we have dB\u227b \u2264 dB .\nP\nP\nProof. Set B = {b1 , . . . , bN }. Write bi = x\u03b1 \u2208B\u227b ci,\u03b1 x\u03b1 + kh=1 uh gh\nwhere ci,\u03b1 \u2208 K for i = 1, . . . , N and uh \u2208 K[x]. Then deg(uh gh ) \u2264 deg(bi )\n(by the properties of the division\nalgorithm as we use a graded monoP\nmial ordering). Thus, deg( x\u03b1 \u2208B\u227b ci,\u03b1 x\u03b1 ) \u2264 deg(bi ). Let x\u03b10 \u2208 B\u227b with\ndeg(x\u03b10 ) = dB\u227b . As B, B\u227b are two bases of K[x]/I, the matrix (ci,\u03b1 ) i=1,...,N\n\u03b1\u2208B\u227b\n\nis nonsingular and thus\nP its \u03b10 th column is nonzero. Hence ci,\u03b10 6= 0 for some\ni. Hence dB\u227b = deg( x\u03b1 \u2208B\u227b ci,\u03b1 x\u03b1 ) \u2264 deg(bi ) \u2264 dB .\n\u0003\n\n2.4\n\nFinding the set of standard monomials from an independence oracle\n\nWhen I is a zero-dimensional ideal and \u227b is a monomial ordering on Tn , we\ndescribe a method for finding the set B\u227b of standard monomials, assuming\nwe have an oracle for checking linear independence in K[x]/I. This 'greedy\nsieve' algorithm, described below in Algorithm 1, does not require knowledge\nof a Gr\u00f6bner basis of I.\nThe next lemma shows correctness of Algorithm 1 and how to use it for\nfinding the set B\u227b of standard monomials.\nLemma 2.6. Let I be a zero-dimensional ideal, \u227b a monomial ordering on\nTn , and B\u227b = Tn \\ LT(I), the associated set of standard monomials. For an\ninteger s \u2265 1, let Bs be the set returned by the greedy sieve algorithm applied\nto (I, \u227b, s).\n(i) Bs is linearly independent in K[x]/I and satisfies B\u227b \u2229 Tn,s \u2286 Bs ; in\nparticular, Bs = B\u227b if B\u227b \u2286 Tn,s .\n10\n\n\fAlgorithm 1 The 'greedy sieve' algorithm:\nInput: A zero-dimensional ideal I \u2208 K[x], a monomial ordering \u227b on Tn ,\nand an integer s \u2265 1.\nOutput: A set B \u2286 Tn,s linearly independent in K[x]/I and satisfying\nB \u2287 B\u227b \u2229 Tn,s\n1: Order the monomials in Tn,s with respect to \u227b.\n2: Initialize B := \u2205, L := (t1 , t2 , . . .), the ordered set Tn,s .\n3: while B \u2282 L do\n4:\nSet t as the first element of L \\ B\n5:\nif B \u222a {t} is linearly independent in K[x]/I then\n6:\nReset B := B \u222a {t}\n7:\nelse\n8:\nReset L := L \\ tTn (i.e., remove from L all multiples of t).\n9:\nend if\n10: end while\n11: return B = L\n(ii) If Bs = Bs+1 then Bs = B\u227b .\n(iii) If \u227b is a graded monomial ordering, then Bs \u2286 B\u227b ; therefore, Bs = B\u227b\nif |Bs | = dim K[x]/I.\nProof. (i) Obviously, throughout the algorithm, B is linearly independent\nin K[x]/I and B \u2286 L. Assume tk \u2208 (B\u227b \u2229 Tn,s ) \\ Bs . Consider the step\nwhen the algorithm examines tk and let B be the current set maintained\nby the algorithm. Then, B \u2286 {t1 , . . . , tk\u22121 }, tk \u2208 L \\ B and B \u222a {tk } is\nlinearly dependent in K[x]/I. Hence there exists a polynomial f \u2208 I with\nLT(f ) = tk , contradicting the assumption that tk \u2208 B\u227b . This shows B\u227b \u2229\nTn,s \u2286 Bs . Moreover, if B\u227b \u2286 Tn,s, then B\u227b \u2286 Bs ; equality holds since\n|Bs | \u2264 dim K[x]/I as Bs is linearly independent in K[x]/I, while |B\u227b | =\ndim K[x]/I.\n(ii) Assume Bs = Bs+1 . Then, in view of (i), B\u227b \u2229 (Tn,s+1 \\ Tn,s) = \u2205. This\nimplies B\u227b \u2286 Tn,s . Indeed assume t \u2208 B\u227b has degree at least s + 1; then\nany divisor t\u2032 of t with degree s + 1 lies in B\u227b (since B\u227b is an order ideal)\nand thus t\u2032 \u2208 B\u227b \u2229 (Tn,s+1 \\ Tn,s ) = \u2205, a contradiction. Therefore, by (i),\nBs = B\u227b .\n(iii) Assume \u227b is a graded monomial ordering and, say, B\u227b \u2286 Tn,d for some\ninteger d. If d \u2264 s then Bs = B\u227b by (i). If d \u2265 s + 1, then Bs \u2286 Bd (since\nall elements of Tn,d \\ Tn,s come after the elements of Tn,s in the ordering \u227b)\nand Bd = B\u227b (by (i)), implying Bs \u2286 B\u227b .\n\u0003\nRemark 2.7. Observe that, when \u227b is not a graded monomial degree ordering, one cannot claim the inclusion Bs \u2286 B\u227b . For instance, consider the\nideal I = hx3 \u2212 1, \u2212y + x2 + x + 1i in R[x, y] and choose as monomial ordering \u227b the lexicographic order with y > x. Then, B\u227b = {1, x, x2 } is found\n11\n\n\fwhen applying Algorithm 1 to (I, \u227b, s = 2); observe that B2 = B3 . However,\nthe algorithm applied to (I, \u227b, s = 1) returns the set B1 = {1, x, y}; thus\nB1 6\u2286 B\u227b , while |B1 | = 3 = dim R[x]/I.\nAlternatively, one could initialize the set L in Algorithm 1 to be the full\nordered set Tn . Then the algorithm still terminates in finitely many steps\n(because dim K[x]/I < \u221e) and the set B returned by the algorithm is equal\nto B\u227b (using the same argument as in Lemma 2.6 (i), one can show that\nB\u227b \u2286 B, implying B\u227b = B).\nA crucial tool for applying Algorithm 1 is having an oracle for testing\nlinear independence in K[x]/I. In our setting the oracle will work as follows:\nGiven a subset B \u2286 Tn,s , B is linearly independent in K[x]/I if and only if B\nindexes a linearly independent set of columns of a suitable moment matrix\nMs (y). This motivates why in our presentation of Algorithm 1 we explore\nthe set Tn,s of monomials of degree at most s.\n\n2.5\n\nBorder bases and formal multiplication matrices\n\nWe recall results about border bases following the exposition from [16, Ch. 4].\nSee also [40] for details about border bases. Given an order ideal B \u2286 Tn ,\nthe border of B is the set\n\u2202B := {xi x\u03b2 | x\u03b2 \u2208 B, i = 1, . . . , n} \\ B.\n\n(2.3)\n\nAssume B 6= \u2205, set N := |B|, H := |\u2202B| and write B = {b1 , . . . , bN } and\n\u2202B = {c1 , . . . , cH }. A set of polynomials G = {g1 , . . . , gH } is called a Bborder prebasis if each gj is of the form\ngj = cj \u2212\n\nN\nX\ni=1\n\naij bi for some aij \u2208 K.\n\n(2.4)\n\nOne also says that gj is marked by the element cj of \u2202B. Given a polynomial\nf , the border division\nP algorithm [16, Prop. 4.2.10] produces polynomials\nuj , r such that f = H\nj=1 uj gj + r, and r \u2208 SpanK (B). Hence, for any ideal\nI containing G, B spans the K-vector space K[x]/I. The set G \u2286 I is said\nto be a B-border basis of I if B is linearly independent in K[x]/I, i.e., if B is\na linear basis of K[x]/I; in that case G generates the ideal I.\nStetter [40] advocates using border bases instead of Gr\u00f6bner bases since\nthey do not depend on any monomial ordering. Border bases represent in\nfact an extension of the notion of Gr\u00f6bner bases. Indeed, the set Tn \\ B\ndefines a monomial ideal; the elements of the minimal set of generators of\nthis monomial ideal are called the corners of B, which belong to \u2202B. When\nB = B\u227b is the set of standard monomials for some monomial ordering, there\nexists a unique B\u227b -border basis G of I and the reduced Gr\u00f6bner basis of I\nis the subset of G consisting of the polynomials in G that are marked by the\ncorners of B\u227b .\n12\n\n\fWhen G is a B-border prebasis, one can mimic the construction of the\nmultiplication matrices from the previous section in the following way. Fix\nk \u2208 {1, . . . , n}. The formal multiplication matrix Xk is the N \u00d7 N matrix\nwhose ith column is defined as follows. If xk bi \u2208 B, say, xk bi = br , then the\nith column of Xk is the standard unit vector er (with all zero entries except\n1 at the rth position). Otherwise, xk bi \u2208 \u2202B, say, xk bi = cj , then the ith\ncolumn of Xk is the vector (aij )N\ni=1 (compare with Eqn.(2.4)). We will use\nthe following result (see [16, Thm. 4.3.17]).\nTheorem 2.8. Let B \u2286 Tn be an order ideal, let G be a B-border prebasis\nwith associated formal multiplication matrices X1 , . . . , Xn , and let J := hGi\nbe the ideal generated by G. Then, G is a border basis of J if and only if\nthe matrices X1 , . . . , Xn commute pairwise. In that case, B is a linear basis\nof K[x]/J and the matrix Xk represents the multiplication operator mxk of\nK[x]/J with respect to the basis B.\nRemark 2.9. Following Mourrain [31], call B \u2286 Tn connected to 1 if 1 \u2208 B\nand any monomial in B is of the form xi1 xi2 * * * xik with xi1 , xi1 xi2 , . . . ,\nxi1 xi2 * * * xik \u2208 B. Obviously if B is an order ideal then B is connected to\n1. As shown by Mourrain [31, Th. 3.1], the result of Theorem 2.8 remains\nvalid in the more general setting where B is connected to 1 (instead of being\nan order ideal). We restrict our attention in this paper to monomial bases\nof K[x]/J that are order ideals, in particular, because we have an algorithm\nfor finding such bases, as we just saw in the preceding section. It will be\ninteresting to investigate the use of bases satisfying Mourrain's criterion in\nsubsequent work.\n\n3\n3.1\n\nPreliminaries on Moment Matrices\nMoment matrices\nn\n\nGiven a sequence y \u2208 RN , its real moment matrix M R (y) is the real symmetric matrix indexed by Nn whose (\u03b1, \u03b2)th entry is y\u03b1+\u03b2 , for \u03b1, \u03b2 \u2208 Nn .\n2n\nGiven a sequence y \u2208 CN , its complex moment matrix is the matrix M 2C (y)\nindexed by N2n whose (\u03b1\u03b1\u2032 , \u03b2\u03b2 \u2032 )th entry is y\u03b1\u2032 +\u03b2,\u03b1+\u03b2 \u2032 , for (\u03b1, \u03b1\u2032 ), (\u03b2, \u03b2 \u2032 ) \u2208\nN2n . If y satisfies\n(3.1)\ny\u03b1\u2032 \u03b1 = y\u03b1\u03b1\u2032 for (\u03b1, \u03b1\u2032 ) \u2208 N2n ,\n\nthen M 2C (y) is a Hermitian matrix. Let M C (y) denote the principal submatrix of M 2C (y) indexed by the subset {(0\u03b1\u2032 ) | \u03b1\u2032 \u2208 Nn }; in other words,\none may think of M C (y) as being indexed by Nn with (\u03b1\u2032 , \u03b2 \u2032 )th entry y\u03b1\u2032 \u03b2 \u2032 ;\nlet us call M C (y) a pruned complex moment matrix. These three types of\nmatrices M K (y) (K = R, C) and M 2C (y) will play a central role in our treatment. It will be convenient to think of M K (y) as being indexed by Tn and\n\n13\n\n\fof M 2C (y) as being indexed by\n\u2032\n\nT\u0304n := {x\u03b1 x\u03b1 | \u03b1, \u03b1\u2032 \u2208 Nn } \u2286 C[x, x].\nThus T\u0304n \u223c T2n and we view x as a complex variable in the complex\ncase. Recall that one says that 'f \u2208 K[x] lies in the kernel of M K (y)'\nif M K (y)vec(f\none may identify a polynomial (x, x\u0304) 7\u2192\nP ) = 0. Similarly,\n\u2032\nf (x, x\u0304) = \u03b1,\u03b1\u2032 f\u03b1,\u03b1\u2032 x\u0304\u03b1 x\u03b1 with its sequence of coefficients vec(f ) = (f\u03b1,\u03b1\u2032 )\u03b1,\u03b1\u2032\nwhich allows us to say that 'f \u2208 C[x, x] lies in KerM 2C (y)' if M 2C (y)vec(f ) =\n0.\nWe also need truncated moment matrices. For an integer t \u2265 0, MtK (y)\ndenotes the principal submatrix of M K (y) indexed by Tn,t and Mt2C (y) de\u03b1 \u03b1\u2032\nnotes the principal submatrix of M 2C (y) indexed by the set T\u0304P\nn,t := {x x |\n\u03b1, \u03b1\u2032 \u2208 Nn , |\u03b1| + |\u03b1\u2032 | \u2264 t} \u223c T2n,t .

As rankMtR (y) \u2265 rankMtR (y \u2032 ), equality KerMtR (y) \u2229 KerMtR (z) = KerMtR (y) holds, which implies KerMtR (y) \u2286\nKerMtR (z).

Then,\nMt2C (y)vec(f ) = 0 =\u21d2 Mt2C (y)vec(f g) = 0.\nProof. Set h := f g. (i) As deg(h) \u2264 t \u2212 1 and MtR (y) \u0017 0, it suffices to\nR (y)vec(h) = 0. Moreover it suffices to show the result for g = x ;\nshow Mt\u22121\ni\nR (y)vec(h)) =\nin this latter case one can verify that, for \u03b1 \u2208 Nnt\u22121 , (Mt\u22121\n\u03b1\n(MtR (y)vec(f ))\u03b1+ei = 0.\n2C (y)vec(h)) \u2032\n(ii) Similarly assume g = xi or xi .

KerM R (y) is an ideal in R[x], which is real radical if\nR (y) for some\nM R (y) \u0017 0. Assume M R (y) \u0017 0 and rankM R (y) = rankMt\u22121\ninteger t \u2265 1. Then, KerM R (y) = hKerMtR (y)i and, for B \u2286 Tn , B indexes\na (maximum) nonsingular principal submatrix of M R (y) if and only if B is\na (maximum) linearly independent subset of R[x]/KerM R (y).\nProof. We use the (easy to verify) identity:\nvec(h)T M R (y)vec(pq) = vec(hq)T M R (y)vec(p)\nfor p, q, h \u2208 R[x]. If p \u2208 KerM R (y), q \u2208 R[x], then vec(h)T M R (y)vec(pq) =\nvec(hq)T M R (y)vec(p) = 0 for all h \u2208 R[x], which implies M R (y)vec(pq) = 0\nand thus pq \u2208 KerM R (y). This shows that KerM R (y) is an ideal. AsR\nsume now M R (y) \u0017 0; we show that KerM\nIn view\nPk (y) 2is real radical.\nR\nof Lemma 2.1, it suffices to show that if\nfor some\ni=1 pi \u2208 KerM (y)\nP\npi \u2208 R[x], then pi \u2208 KerM R (y).

For this, let B \u2286 Tn,t\u22121 index\nan r \u00d7 r nonsingular principal submatrix of M R (y). We show that, for all\n\u03b1 \u2208 Nn , x\u03b1 \u2208 SpanR (B) + J, using induction on |\u03b1|. This holds for |\u03b1| \u2264 t\n\u03b1\n\u03b4\nby the definition of B. Assume\nP |\u03b1| \u2265 t\u03b2+ 1 and write x = xi x . By the\n\u03b4\ninduction\nP assumption, x = x\u03b2 \u2208B c\u03b2 x + q where q \u2208 J, c\u03b2 \u2208 R. Thus,\nx\u03b1 = x\u03b2 \u2208B c\u03b2 xi x\u03b2 + xi q. Here, xi q \u2208 J and xi x\u03b2 \u2208 SpanR (B) + J since\n18\n\n\fdeg(xi x\u03b2 ) \u2264 t, which implies x\u03b1 \u2208 SpanR (B) + J. Thus we have shown that\nR[x] = SpanR (B) + J. As KerM R (y) \u2229 SpanR (B) = {0}, this implies easily\nthat KerM R (y) = J.\nFor B \u2286 Tn , it is obvious that B indexes a nonsingular submatrix of\nR\nM (y) if and only if B is linearly independent in R[x]/KerM R (y). The\nlast statement of the lemma now follows since dim R[x]/KerM R (y) = r (as\nKerM R (y) is radical and using the identity |VC (KerM R (y))| = rankM R (y)\nfrom Theorem 3.3).\n\u0003\nProposition 3.7. KerM 2C (y) is an ideal in C[x, x]. If M 2C (y) \u0017 0, then\nKerM 2C (y) is a radical ideal in C[x, x] and thus KerM C (y) is a radical ideal\nC (y) for some integer\nin C[x]. Assume, moreover, rankM C (y) = rankMt\u22121\nC\nC\nt \u2265 1. Then, KerM (y) = hKerMt (y)i and, for B \u2286 Tn , B indexes a\n(maximum) nonsingular principal submatrix of M C (y) if and only if B is a\n(maximum) linearly independent subset of C[x]/KerM C (y).\nProof. As in the real case, we use the following (easy to verify) identities:\nFor h, p, q \u2208 C[x, x\u0304],\nvec(h)\u2217 M 2C (y)vec(pq) = vec(hp)\u2217 M 2C (y)vec(q),\nvec(p)\u2217 M 2C (y)vec(p) = vec(1)\u2217 M 2C (y)vec(pp),\nvec(p2 )\u2217 M 2C (y)vec(p2 ) = vec(pp)\u2217 M 2C (y)vec(pp),\nwhere p \u2208 C[x, x] is defined as p(x, x) := p(x, x). This implies directly that\nKerM 2C (y) is an ideal. Assume now M 2C (y) \u0017 0; we show that KerM 2C (y)\nis radical. In view of Lemma 2.1, this follows from the following fact:\np2 \u2208 KerM 2C (y)\n=\u21d2 0 = vec(p2 )\u2217 M 2C (y)vec(p2 ) = vec(pp)\u2217 M 2C (y)vec(pp)\n=\u21d2 pp \u2208 KerM 2C (y)\n=\u21d2 0 = vec(1)\u2217 M 2C (y)vec(pp) = vec(p)\u2217 M 2C (y)vec(p)\n=\u21d2 p \u2208 KerM 2C (y).\nThe proof for the last statements of the proposition is identical to the proof\nof the corresponding statements in Proposition 3.6 for the real case.\n\u0003\nWithout the assumption M 2C (y) \u0017 0, KerM C (y) is not necessarily an\n2n\nideal in C[x]. Indeed, for the sequence y \u2208 CN defined by y\u03b1\u03b1\u2032 := 0\nif \u03b1 = 0 or \u03b1\u2032 = 0, and y\u03b1\u03b1\u2032 := 1 otherwise, M C (y) \u0017 0, M 2C (y) 6\u0017 0\nand KerM C (y) is not an ideal (e.g., 1 \u2208 KerM C (y) while any nonconstant\nmonomial does not lie in KerM C (y)). We mention for further reference the\nfollowing corollary, and we conclude the section with the proof of Proposition\n1.1 and a lemma about the '(real) radical'-like property of the kernel of a\npositive semidefinite truncated moment matrix.\nR (y) =:\nCorollary 3.8.

We prove only (i). By Theorem 3.4, y has an extension \u1ef9 \u2208 RN\nsuch that M R (\u1ef9) is a flat extension of MtR (y). By Proposition 3.6, the\nideal KerM R (\u1ef9) = hKerMs (y)i =: J is real radical and zero-dimensional,\ndim R[x]/J = r, and J \u2229 R[x]s = KerM R (\u1ef9) \u2229 R[x]s = KerMsR (\u1ef9) =\n\u0003\nKerMsR (y).\nProof of Proposition 1.1. By Proposition 3.6, J := KerM R (y) is a real\nradical ideal, since M R (y) \u0017 0. As 0 = M R (hj y) = M R (y)vec(hj ) for all\nj, we have I \u2286 J, which implies that VR (J) \u2286 VR (I) is finite. As J is real\nradical, we deduce that VC (J) = VR (J) \u2286 Rn . Hence J is zero-dimensional\nand I(VR (I)) \u2286 J since VC (J) \u2286 VR (I). Set r := dim R[x]/J = |VC (J)| \u2264\n|VR (I)|. Let B \u2286 Tn be a linear basis of R[x]/J, |B| = r. Then the columns\nof M R (y) indexed by B form a basis of the column space of M R (y) and thus\nrankM R (y) = r. Moreover, r = |VR (I)| if and only if VC (J) = VR (I) which\nin turn is equivalent to J = I(VR (I)).\nP Now, this maximum rank |VR (I)| is\n\u03bc\nreached by the sequence y := y = v\u2208VR (I) \u03bbv \u03b6v with \u03bbv > 0 which indeed\nsatisfies (1.1).\n\u0003\nFinally, it is useful to observe that the kernel of a positive semidefinite\ntruncated moment matrix enjoys the following '(real) radical'-like property.\nWe omit the proof whose details are straightforward.\nP\nLemma 3.9.

It turns out that the method also applies\nto the radical ideal I(VC (I)). Our strategy is to obtain I(VK (I)) (K = R\nor C) as the ideal generated by the kernel of some suitable moment matrix\nMtK (y) where y \u2208 KtK . Sections 4.1-4.3 contain some results ensuring that\n20\n\n\fthe moment matrix MtK (y) has the desirable properties for achieving this\ntask and Section 4.4 describes our algorithm.\n\n4.1\n\nWeakest set of conditions\n\nThroughout, I = hh1 , . . . , hm i is an ideal in K[x] for which we want to find\nthe radical ideal I(VK (I)), K = R or C.

Let t \u2265 d, 1 \u2264 s \u2264 t, y \u2208 KtK for which rankMtK (y) is\nmaximum, and B \u2286 Tn,s\u22121 index a maximum nonsingular principal submaK (y) with border \u2202B defined as in (2.3). Assume (i)-(iii) below\ntrix of Ms\u22121\nhold:\n(i) B is an order ideal.\n(ii) The principal submatrix of MsK (y) indexed by B \u222a \u2202B has the same rank\nK (y); that is, with B := {b , . . . , b } and \u2202B := {c , . . . , c },\nas Ms\u22121\n1\nN\n1\nH\nthere exists a polynomial gj \u2208 KerMsK (y) of the form gj (x) = cj \u2212\nPN\ni=1 aij bi (i.e., G := {g1 , . . . , gH } is a B-border prebasis).\n\n(iii) The formal multiplication matrices X1 , . . . , Xn defined from G commute\npairwise.\n\nThen G is a border basis of J := hGi \u2286 I(VK (I)), B is a linear basis of\nK[x]/J, and one can extract (using the formal multiplication matrices) the\nK (y). Moreset W := VC (J) which satisfies VK (I) \u2286 W and |W | \u2264 rankMs\u22121\nK\nover, if |VK (I)| = |W | = rankMs\u22121 (y), then VK (I) = W , I(VK (I)) = J, and\nG is a B-border basis of I(VK (I)).\nProof. Theorem 2.8 gives directly that G is a border basis of the ideal\nJ = hGi and that B is a linear basis of R[x]/J. Moreover, the matrices\nX1 , . . . , Xn coincide with the multiplication matrices in R[x]/J w.r.t. the\nbasis B. Thus one can compute the set W = VC (J) from their eigenvectors.\nBy construction, J \u2286 hKerMsK (y)i \u2286 hKerMtK (y)i \u2286 I(VK (I)), where the\nlast inclusion follows from Lemmas 3.1 and 3.2 (i). This implies VK (I) \u2286\nK (y).\nVC (J) = W . Moreover, |W | \u2264 dim K[x]/J = |B| = rankMs\u22121\nK\nIf |VK (I)| = |W | = rankMs\u22121 (y), then W = VK (I) and J is radical since\ndim K[x]/J = |VC (J)|, which implies I(VK (I)) = I(W ) = I(VC (J)) = J. \u0003\nIn the next two subsections we give simple rank conditions (4.1), (4.5),\nwhich ensure that the conditions of Proposition 4.1 hold. (See Remark 4.13\nfor details.) For the sake of clarity, we treat the real and complex cases\nseparately.\n\n4.2\n\nCharacterizing and computing the real radical I(VR (I))\n\nAssume I = hh1 , . . . , hm i is an ideal in R[x], with h1 , . . . , hm \u2208 R[x].\n21\n\n\fProposition 4.2.

One can compute the set W := VC (J)\nwhich satisfies VR (I) \u2286 W and |W | = r. Moreover, if VR (I) = W then\nI(VR (I)) = J.\nProof. By Lemma 3.1, KerMsR (y) \u2286 KerMtR (y) \u2286 I(VR (I)), implying\nJ \u2286 I(VR (I)) and thus VR (I) \u2286 W . By Corollary 3.8 (i), as J is radical,\n|W | = dim R[x]/J = r, and VR (I) = W implies I(VR (I)) = I(W ) = J.\n\u0003\nOne can verify (using Lemma 3.5) that, if (4.1) holds for some s \u2264 t \u2212 2,\nthen it also holds for s = t \u2212 1. Hence it suffices to check whether (4.1)\nholds for s = t \u2212 1 or t. In Lemma 4.3 below, we observe that, if assumption\n(ii) in Proposition 4.1 holds for s \u2264 t \u2212 1, then in fact (4.1) holds and thus\nProposition 4.2 applies. However, it may be that Proposition 4.1 applies to\nthe case s = t while (4.1) does not hold; see Example 5.3 (for relaxation\norder t = 2) for such an instance. In Remark 4.13 below we see that the\nconverse of the next lemma holds.\nLemma 4.3. In Proposition 4.1, if assumption (ii) holds for s \u2264 t \u2212 1 then\nK (y) = rankM K (y).\nrankMs\u22121\ns\nProof.\nWe have to show that Tn,s \u2286 SpanK (B) + KerMs (y). By the\ndefinition of B, any x\u03b1 \u2208 Tn,s\u22121 lies in SpanK (B) + KerMs\u22121\n(y). For x\u03b1 \u2208\nP\n\u03b2\n\u03b4\nTn,s , write x\u03b1 = x1 x\u03b4 where x\u03b4 \u2208 Tn,s\u22121 . Thus\nx\u03b2 \u2208B c\u03b2 x + p\nPx =\n\u03b1\n\u03b2\nK\nwhere p \u2208 KerMs\u22121 (y), c\u03b2 \u2208 K. Therefore, x = x\u03b2 \u2208B c\u03b2 x1 x + x1 p. As\nx1 x\u03b2 \u2208 B \u222a \u2202B, assumption (ii) implies that x1 x\u03b2 \u2208 SpanK (B) + KerMsK (y).\nAs deg(x1 p) \u2264 s \u2264 t \u2212 1, it follows from Lemma 3.5 that x1 p \u2208 KerMsK (y).\nTherefore, x\u03b1 \u2208 SpanK (B) + KerMs (y).\n\u0003\nBy strengthening the rank condition (4.1), one can show that J =\nI(VR (I)), i.e., the desired real radical ideal is found.\nProposition 4.4. Let t \u2265 d and y \u2208 KtR for which rankMtR (y) is maximum.\nAssume that, either (4.1) holds for some 2d \u2264 s \u2264 t, or\nR\n(y)\nrankMsR (y) = rankMs\u2212d\n\n(4.2)\n\nfor some d \u2264 s \u2264 t. Then I(VR (I)) = hKerMsR (y)i (and one can find VR (I)).\nMoreover, rankMsR (y) = |VR (I)|.\nProof. In view of Proposition 4.2, there remains only to show the inclusion I(VR (I)) \u2286 J := hKerMsR (y)i or, equivalently (since J is radical),\nW := VC (J) \u2286 VR (I). We already know that W \u2286 Rn since J is real radical\n22\n\n\fand zero-dimensional (see Corollary 3.8). We now show that W \u2286 VC (I).\nR (h y) = 0, we have\nAssume first that (4.1) holds for s \u2265 2d. As Mt\u2212d\nj\nj\n(hj y)\u03b1 = 0 for all |\u03b1| \u2264 2t \u2212 2dj and thus for all |\u03b1| \u2264 2dj . Hence,\nR (y)vec(h ) = 0 and thus h \u2208 KerM R (y). Therefore, I \u2286 J, giving\nM2d\nj\nj\ns\nj\nW \u2286 VC (I).\nAssume now that (4.2) holds for some d \u2264 s \u2264 t. Let pv (v \u2208 W ) be\ninterpolation polynomials, i.e., pv (w) = \u03b4v,w for v, w \u2208 W . As observed in\n[29, Lemma 27], one can assume that deg(pv ) \u2264 s\u2212d. (Indeed, let B \u2286 Tn,s\u2212d\nindex a maximum nonsingular submatrix of MsR (y); then B is a basis of\nR[x]/J by Corollary 3.8 and one can replace pv by its residue modulo\nJ w.r.t.\nP\nB.) \u00bfFrom Theorems 3.3, 3.4, we know that (y\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208Tn,2s =\nv\u2208W \u03bbv \u03b62s,v\nT\nR\nwhere \u03bbv > 0. Hence, 0 = vec(pv ) Ms\u2212dj (hj y)vec(pv ) = hj (v)\u03bbv implies\nhj (v) = 0 for all j and thus v \u2208 VC (I), which shows W \u2286 VC (I).\n\u0003\nWe now formulate an analogous result for the ideal I(VR (I) \u2229 S), where\nS := {x \u2208 Rn | hm+1 (x) \u2265 0, . . . , hm+k (x) \u2265 0} is a semialgebraic set, with\nhm+1 , . . . , hm+k \u2208 R[x].

Then J := hKerMsR (y)i \u2286\nI(VR (I) \u2229 S) and W := VC (J) \u2287 VR (I) \u2229 S with |W | = rankMsR (y);\nmoreover, J = I(VR (I) \u2229 S) if W = VR (I) \u2229 S.\n(ii) Assume (4.2) holds for some d \u2264 s \u2264 t. Then I(VR (I)\u2229S) = hKerMsR (y)i.\nProof.\n(i) The inclusion KerMtR (y) \u2286 I(VR (I) \u2229 S) follows from the\nR for all\nmaximality of the rank of MtR (y) and the fact that \u03b62t,v \u2208 Kt,S\nv \u2208 VR (I) \u2229 S. This gives J \u2286 I(VR (I) \u2229 S) and thus W \u2287 VR (I) \u2229 S.\nEquality W = VR (I) \u2229 S implies I(VR (I) \u2229 S) = I(W ) = J (as J radical).\nThis concludes the proof of (i). The proof for (ii) is analogous to that of the\ncorresponding statement in Proposition 4.4.\n\u0003\nTo conclude we show that, when VR (I) is finite, then condition (4.2)\nis satisfied for t large enough. That is, the conclusion of Propositions 4.4,\n4.5 holds: the real radical ideal I(VR (I)) or I(VR (I) \u2229 S) = hKerMsR (y)i is\nfound.\nProposition 4.6.

Hence 1 \u2208\nKerMtR (y), implying y0 = 0, which contradicts the fact that y0 = 1 for\nR . Therefore, K R = \u2205 for t \u2265 t , which shows (i).\ny \u2208 Kt,S\n0\nt,S\n\nAssume now VR (I) 6= \u2205. Let {g1 , . . . , gk } be a Gr\u00f6bner basis of I(VR (I))\nfor a graded monomial ordering ordering and let B be the corresponding set of standard monomials. Thus B is a basis of R[x]/I(VR (I)); set\ndB := maxb\u2208B deg(b) (which is well defined as B 6= \u2205). We can write any\nP\n(\u03b1)\n(\u03b1)\nmonomial as x\u03b1 = r (\u03b1) + kl=1 pl gl , where r (\u03b1) \u2208 SpanR (B), pl \u2208 R[x]\n(\u03b1)\nand deg(pl gl ) \u2264 deg(x\u03b1 ). Set t1 := max(dB + d, t0 ) and let t \u2265 t1 + 1.\n(\u03b1)\nConsider \u03b1 \u2208 Tn,t1 . As deg(pl gl ) \u2264 t1 \u2264 t \u2212 1 and gl \u2208 KerMtR (y), we have\n(\u03b1)\npl gl \u2208 KerMt (y) and thus x\u03b1 \u2212 r (\u03b1) \u2208 KerMt (y). As deg(r (\u03b1) ) \u2264 dB \u2264\nt1 \u2212 d, this shows that the \u03b1th column of MtR (y) is a linear combination\nof columns indexed by Tn,t1 . Therefore, rankMtR1 (y) = rankMtR1 \u2212d (y), thus\nproving (ii).\n\u0003\nRemark 4.8. Detecting existence of real solutions.

We now show that the vectors \u03b6t1 \u2212d,v (v \u2208 W ) are\nlinearly independent, which implies that rankMtC1 \u2212d (y) = |W | = r, thus\nconcluding the proof.

Under condition (4.1) or (4.5), the assumptions (i)-(iii) of\nProposition 4.1 hold. Namely, one can construct an order ideal B \u2286 Tn,s\u22121\nK (y). Moreindexing a maximum nonsingular principal submatrix of Ms\u22121\nover, one can choose B = B\u227b , the set of standard monomials for the ideal\nJ := hKerMsK (y)i with respect to a graded lexicographic order; this is possible since J is zero-dimensional and there is a basis in Tn,s\u22121 for K[x]/J,\nwhich implies B\u227b \u2286 Tn,s\u22121 by Lemma 2.5. Such a basis B\u227b can be found\nusing the greedy sieve algorithm described in Section 2.4. The execution\nof the algorithm requires checking whether some set T \u2286 Tn,s\u22121 is linearly\nindependent in K[x]/J. Using Corollary 3.8, this can be checked by testing\nwhether T indexes a nonsingular principal submatrix of MtK (y), thus by a\nrank computation on MtK (y). Finally the formal multiplication matrices as\ndefined in Proposition 4.1 coincide with the (usual) multiplication matrices\nin K[x]/J and thus they commute pairwise.\nTherefore, the conclusion of Proposition 4.1 also applies under (4.1) or\n(4.5): If W = VK (I) then one can construct a border basis of J = I(VK (I)).\nMoreover, when using B\u227b , one can also construct the reduced Gr\u00f6bner basis\nof J for the graded lexicographic monomial ordering. A sufficient condition\nfor W = VK (I) is given above in Proposition 4.4 (K = R) and Proposition 4.11 (K = C).\nIn fact, as will be explained in Section 4.4.5, we can adapt this strategy\nto find a Gr\u00f6bner basis for an arbitrary monomial ordering.\n26\n\n\fRemark 4.14. The above results involve the matrix Mt2C (y) where the\n2n\nargument y \u2208 CN is a complex sequence satisfying (3.1). As explained in\nSection 3.2 above, one may work instead with the moment matrix M R (a)\n2n\nwhere a \u2208 RN is the real sequence defined as in (3.4), and Propositions\n4.10 and 4.11 could be reformulated in terms of real sequences only.\nIn fact, when the ideal I is generated by real polynomials h1 , . . . , hm ,\nits set VC (I) of complex roots is closed under complex conjugations, i.e.,\nv \u2208 VC (I) \u21d0\u21d2 v\u0304 \u2208 VC (I) and, for a polynomial f \u2208 C[x], f \u2208 I(VC (I)) if and\nonly if its real and imaginary parts belong to I(VC (I)); that is, it suffices to\ndetermine I(VC (I))\u2229R[x]. For this, it suffices to consider real valued matrices\n2n\n2n\nMtC (y) (or Mt2C (y)), i.e., with y \u2208 KtC \u2229RN2t (or Kt2C \u2229RN2t ) in Propositions\n4.1, 4.10 and 4.11. Indeed, one may e.g. easily verify that Lemma 3.2\nremains valid within the context of real polynomials and replacing KtC (or\n2n\n2n\nKt2C ) by KtC \u2229 RN2t (or Kt2C \u2229 RN2t ). (Use here the fact that, since VC (I)\nis closed under conjugation, then 21 (\u03b62t,v\u0304 \u2297 \u03b62t,v + \u03b62t,v \u2297 \u03b62t,v\u0304 ) belongs to\n2n\nKt2C \u2229 RN2t .)\n\n4.4\n\nAlgorithm and implementation\n\nWith the results of Sections 4.1-4.3 we have all the ingredients needed to\ncompute the radical ideals I(VR (I)) and I(VC (I)) of an ideal I given by its\ngenerators. We now describe the algorithm in more detail.\nFor convenience, let Kt (resp., Mt (y)) stand for KtR , KtC , Kt2C (resp.,\nR\nMt (y), MtC (y), Mt2C (y)). For the task of computing I(VR (I)), we will use\nKt = KtR (and apply Propositions 4.1, 4.2, 4.4) and for the task of computing\nI(VC (I)) we use Kt = KtC (and apply Proposition 4.1) or Kt = Kt2C (and\napply Propositions 4.10, 4.11). The algorithm consists of five main parts:\nFor a given order t \u2265 d,\n(i) Find an element y \u2208 Kt maximizing the rank of Mt (y).\n(ii) Check the ranks of the principal submatrices of Mt (y).\n(iii) Compute a basis for the column space of Ms\u22121 (y) and the quotient\nspace K[x]/J (J = hKerMs (y)i, for suitable 1 \u2264 s \u2264 t).\n(iv) Compute the formal multiplication matrices.\n(v) Construct a basis for the ideal J.\nIn step (ii) we search for a submatrix Ms (y) of Mt (y) satisfying Proposition 4.1 (i)-(iii), or the rank condition (4.1) (resp. (4.5)), or (4.2) (resp.\n(4.6)). Depending on what condition is satisfied, the algorithm returns a\nsubideal J \u2286 I(VK (I)) together with a superset W \u2287 VK (I), or the desired\nradical ideal I(VK (I)) and the desired set of roots VK (I). One can anyway verify a posteriori whether W = VK (I), simply by checking whether\n27\n\n\fhj (v) = 0 for all j \u2264 m and v \u2208 W . In the sequel of this section we give\nmore details about these different tasks.\n4.4.1\n\nFinding y \u2208 Kt maximizing the rank of Mt (y)\n\nThis first task can be cast as the problem of finding a feasible solution of a\nsemidefinite program, that has maximum rank. For details on the theory and\napplications of semidefinite programming the interested reader is referred,\ne.g., to [43], [46]. It is a known geometric property of semidefinite programs\nthat a feasible solution has maximum rank if and only if it lies in the relative\ninterior of the feasible region and that such point can be found with interiorpoint algorithms using self-dual embedding (see, e.g., [15], [46]). Let us give\nsome details.\nConsider a general instance of semidefinite program\np\u2217 := inf\n\nm\nX\n\nbj yj s.t.\n\nm\nX\nj=1\n\nj=1\n\nyj Aj \u2212 C \u0017 0\n\n(4.7)\n\nand its dual semidefinite program\nd\u2217 := sup Tr(CX) s.t.

There is no dualityPgap (i.e., p\u2217 = d\u2217 ),\ne.g., when (4.7) is strictly feasible (i.e., \u2203y \u2208 Rm with m\nj=1 yj Aj \u2212 C \u227b 0)\nor when (4.8) is strictly feasible (i.e., \u2203X \u227b 0 feasible for (4.8)). When (4.8)\nis strictly feasible and d\u2217 < \u221e, then (4.7) attains its minimum, i.e., the set\nof optimal solutions is nonempty. The feasible region to (4.7) is the convex\nset\nP\nPm\n\u2217\nm\nK = {y | m\nj=1 yj Aj \u2212 C \u0017 0} = {y | u ( j=1 yj Aj \u2212 C)u \u2265 0 \u2200u \u2208 K }.\n\nTherefore,\nfor y \u2208 K, y lies P\nin the relative interior of K if and only if\nP\nm\nKer( m\ny\nA\n\u2212\nC)\n\u2286\nKer(\nj=1Pj j\nj=1 zj Aj \u2212 C) for all z \u2208 K or, equivam\nlently, if\nj=1 yj Aj \u2212 C has maximum possible rank (same argument as\nfor Lemma 3.1).\nSemidefinite programs can be solved in polynomial time to an arbitrary\nprecision using, e.g., the ellipsoid method, whose running time is however\nprohibitively high in practice. Interior-point methods are now the method of\nchoice for solving semidefinite programs. Assuming strict feasibility of (4.7)\nand (4.8), interior-point algorithms construct sequences of points on the\nso-called central path, which has the property of converging to an optimum\nsolution of maximum rank [20]. One can also find a maximum rank optimum\nsolution under the weaker assumption that (4.7), (4.8) are feasible (but not\nnecessarily strictly feasible), if p\u2217 is attained, and p\u2217 = d\u2217 < \u221e. Indeed\n28\n\n\fone can then construct the so-called extended self-dual embedding which is\na strictly feasible semidefinite program with the property that a maximum\nrank optimum solution to it yields a maximum rank optimum solution to\nthe original problem (4.7) (see e.g. [15, Ch. 4], [46, Ch. 5]).\nFor our problem of finding y \u2208 Kt maximizing rankMt (y), consider the\nsemidefinite program\np\u2217 := min 1 s.t. Mt (y) \u0017 0, Mt\u2212dj (hj y) = 0 (j = 1, . . . , m), y0 = 1, (4.9)\nwhere we add the condition (3.1) in the complex case. One can interpret\n(see, e.g., [25]) the dual of (4.9) as\nP\nd\u2217 := max \u03bb s.t. 1 \u2212 \u03bb = s + m\nj=1 qj hj with s, qj polynomials\ndeg(s), deg(qj hj ) \u2264 2t, s is s.o.s.\n(4.10)\nwhere\nP 's is s.o.s.' means that s can be written as a sum of squares, i.e.,\ns = h |uh |2 for some polynomials uh \u2208 K[x] or C[x, x]. Obviously, (4.9) is\nfeasible if VK (I) 6= \u2205. Moreover, (4.10) is feasible (e.g. with \u03bb = 1, s = qj = 0\nas feasible solution) and, if Kt 6= \u2205, then p\u2217 = 1 is attained by the whole\nset Kt and p\u2217 = d\u2217 = 1. Hence an interior-point algorithm implementing\nthe self-dual embedding technique applied to problem (4.9) is guaranteed to\nreturn the following information5 : Either (i) y \u2208 Kt maximizing rankMt (y),\nor (ii) a certificate that (4.9) is infeasible thus implying VK (I) = \u2205. For our\ncomputations we use the semidefinite programming solver SeDuMi-1.05 [41,\n42] which has this feature. Practically, this means that the solution returned\nby the algorithm is very close to a maximum rank optimum solution.\nRemark 4.15. When using a semidefinite programming solver without\nthe maximum rank property, one can recover a maximum rank solution\nto (4.9) from a feasible solution \u0177 to (4.9), using the following simple iterative P\nalgorithm. Let u1 , . . . , up be a set of vectors that span KerMt (\u0177), set\nC := pi=1 ui u\u2217i , and consider the semidefinite program: maxhC, Mt (y)i subject to y satisfying the constraints of (4.9). If the optimum value is equal to\n0, then \u0177 is in fact a solution of maximum rank. Otherwise, let y1 be the optimum solution returned by the solver; then KerMt (\u0177) 6\u2286 KerMt (y1 ). Then,\ny2 := 12 (\u0177+y1 ) is feasible for (4.9) and KerMt (y2 ) = KerMt (\u0177)\u2229KerMt (y1 ) \u2282\nKerMt (\u0177). Hence we have found a feasible solution y2 to (4.9) for which the\nrank of Mt (y2 ) is larger than that Mt (\u0177). Iterate replacing \u0177 by y2 .\n4.4.2\n\nChecking ranks of submatrices of Mt (y)\n\nOnce a maximum rank matrix Mt (y) is found, one has to check if for some\n1 \u2264 s \u2264 t the conditions of Proposition 4.1 (i)-(iii) hold, or if (4.1) (resp.\n5\n\nThree options (I),(II),(III) are described in [46, Ch. 5, p. 119]; (i) corresponds to (I)\nand (ii) to (II),(III). Indeed, under (III) a certificate is reported that no complementary\npair exists which implies, in our case, that (4.9) is infeasible, since any y \u2208 Kt together\nwith the solution \u03bb = 1, s = qj = 0 to (4.10) makes a complementary pair.\n\n29\n\n\f(4.5)) holds, or if (4.2) (resp. (4.6)) holds. For this one has to compute the\nranks of the principal submatrices Ms (y) of Mt (y) for s \u2264 t. Checking the\nrank of a matrix consisting of numerical values is computationally sensitive.\nThis is carried out using singular value decomposition which at the same\ntime can be used to generate a basis of the column space; see the next section\nfor more details. The determination of the rank is done by detecting zero\nsingular values or a decay of more than 1e-3 between two subsequent values,\nwhere singular values less than 1e-8 are declared to be zero.\n4.4.3\n\nComputing a basis for the column space of Ms\u22121 (y) and the\nquotient space K[x]/J\n\nWe indicate here how to compute a basis of the column space of the matrix\nMs\u22121 (y). Under some conditions (recall Corollary 3.8), such basis also yields\na basis of the quotient space K[x]/J (as before, J := hKerMs (y)i), which\nis needed for the computation of the multiplication matrices. The choice of\nthis basis will have an influence on the numerical stability of the extracted\nset W of solutions and on the properties of the basis for J as well.\nUsing singular value decomposition. It is a well known fact from linear\nalgebra that a numerically stable way of finding an orthonormal basis B for\nthe column space of a matrix M is to use its singular value decomposition\n(SVD): M = U \u03a3V \u2217 , where U, V are unitary and \u03a3 is diagonal with nonnegative entries. The diagonal entries of \u03a3 are the singular values of M (i.e., the\nsquare roots of the eigenvalues of M M \u2217 ); the number of nonzero diagonal\nentries of \u03a3 is thus equal to r := rank M . Then the set {U1 , . . . , Ur } of\ncolumns of U corresponding to the nonzero diagonal entries of \u03a3 forms an\northonormal basis of the column space of M . As we already did perform a\nSVD to determine the rank of the matrix M := Ms\u22121 (y), this computation\nT\ncomes with no extra effort. For i = 1, . . . , r, let bi := \u03b6s\u22121,x\nUi be the polynomial with vector of coefficients vec(bi ) = Ui . The next lemma shows that,\nunder some rank condition, {b1 , . . . , br } is a basis of K[x]/J.\nLemma 4.16. Let {U1 , . . . , Ur } be a basis of the column space of Ms\u22121 (y),\nT\nUi (i = 1, . . . , r), and assume that the rank condition (4.1) or\nlet bi := \u03b6s\u22121,x\n(4.5) holds. Then the set {b1 , . . . , br } is a basis of the quotient space K[x]/J.\n\nProof. As the rank condition (4.1) or (4.5) holds, we know from Corollary 3.8 that dim K[x]/J = r := rankMs\u22121 (y) and J\u2229Ks\u22121 [x] = KerMs\u22121 (y).\nHence it suffices to\nthat {b1 , . . . , br } is linearly\nindependent in K[x]/J.\nPr\nPshow\nr\nT\nFor this\ni=1 \u03bbi bi \u2208 J, i.e., \u03b6s\u22121,x ( i=1 \u03bbi Ui ) \u2208 J. The vector\nP assume\np := ri=1 \u03bbi Ui lies in the column space of Ms\u22121 (y). On the other hand,\np \u2208 KerMs\u22121 (y) since the corresponding polynomial p lies in J \u2229 Ks\u22121 [x].\nTherefore, p = 0 which implies that all \u03bbi = 0.\n\u0003\nUsing a 'greedy' algorithm. If we want to compute a border basis or a\nGr\u00f6bner basis with our algorithm, we need a monomial basis B (i.e., B \u2286 Tn )\n30\n\n\ffor the quotient space K[x]/J. For this, it suffices to construct a set B\nindexing a maximum principal nonsingular submatrix of Ms\u22121 (y) as B is\nthen a basis of K[x]/J under the conditions of Corollary 3.8. One can apply\nthe following simple procedure (proposed in [29]) for constructing B: Scan\nmonomials in Tn,s\u22121 by increasing degree, starting with t0 = 1, t1 = x1 , t2 =\nx2 , . . .. Initialize B := {t0 }. Let B be the current set and tk be the current\nmonomial to be scanned. If B \u222a {tk } indexes a linearly independent set\nof columns of Ms\u22121 (y), then reset B := B \u222a {tk }, otherwise scan the next\nmonomial tk+1 . This procedure is 'greedy' in the sense that one keeps adding\nas many low degree monomials as possible to the basis. One can stop as\nsoon as |B| = r. Alternatively, one may construct a reduced row echelon\nform of Ms\u22121 (y) using Gauss Jordan elimination with partial pivoting (pivot\nvariables serve as basis B), see [21]. One can verify afterwards whether the\nconstructed basis B is an order ideal; it turns out that this is the case in\nmost tested instances.\nThe greedy sieve algorithm described earlier in Section 2.4 produces\ndirectly an order ideal basis. Indeed, given any graded monomial ordering\n\u227b, we can apply it to obtain the set B = B\u227b of standard monomials for this\nordering, forming an order ideal basis of K[x]/J (as we know from Lemma\n2.5 that B\u227b is contained in Tn,s\u22121 under the conditions of Corollary 3.8.) See\nSection 4.4.5 for an extension to the case of an arbitrary monomial ordering.\nNote that, although desirable from an algebraic point of view, monomial\nbases for K[x]/J sometimes lead to a less accurate set W of extracted solutions as compared to those extracted with a polynomial basis B based on\nSVD; see e.g. Examples 5.4, 5.5.\n4.4.4\n\nComputing formal multiplication matrices\n\nLet B = {b1 , . . . , br } be a basis of the column space of Ms\u22121 (y). By the assumptions of Proposition 4.1 or under the rank conditions (4.1) or (4.5),\nP\n(ij)\n(ij)\nthere exist scalars ak (k = 1, . . . , r) for which xi bj \u2212 rk=1 ak bk \u2208\n(ij)\nKerMs (y), for all i = 1, . . . , n, j = 1, . . . , r. Then the vector (ak )rk=1\nis the jth column of the (formal) multiplication matrix Xxi . We indicate\nhow to compute Xxi from Ms (y).\nSuppose first that B is a monomial basis, i.e., B \u2286 Tn,s\u22121 . Let MB denote\nthe principal submatrix of Ms (y) indexed by B and let Pxi be the submatrix\nof Ms (y) whose rows are indexed by B and whose columns are indexed by\nthe set xi B := {xi bj | j = 1, . . . , r}. As observed in [29], we have\nXxi = MB\u22121 Pxi .\n\n(4.11)\n\nIndeed, for b \u2208 Tn,s, let Cb denote the column of Ms (y) indexed by b re-\n\n31\n\n\fstricted to the rows indexed by B. Then,\nCxi bj =\n\nr\nX\n\n(ij)\n\nak Cbk = MB a(ij) ,\n\n(4.12)\n\nk=1\n\ni.e., a(ij) = MB\u22121 Cxi bj , which gives Xxi = MB\u22121 Pxi .\n\nSuppose now that B is a polynomial basis obtained via SVD, as explained\nT\nabove. That is, bi = \u03b6s\u22121,x\nUi where {U1 , . . . , Ur } is an orthonormal basis of\nthe column space of Ms\u22121 (y) and thus of Ms (y) under the rank condition\n(4.1) or (4.5). As in the monomial case, the formal multiplication matrices\ncan be derived from Ms (y). Let P\u0303xi denote the submatrix of Ms (y) with\ncolumns indexed by xi Tn,s\u22121 and with rows indexed by Tn,s\u22121 . Let U denote\nthe matrix with columns U1 , . . . , Ur , and set Pxi := U T P\u0303xi U and MB :=\nU T Ms\u22121 (y)U . Then, MB is nonsingular. Moreover,\nMB Xxi = Pxi ,\n\n(4.13)\n\nwhich allows the computation of Xxi = MB\u22121 Pxi = \u03a3\u22121 Pxi where \u03a3 is the\ndiagonal matrix containing the positive singular values of Ms\u22121 (y). We verP\n(ij)\nify that (4.13) holds. By construction, the polynomial xi bj \u2212 rk=1 ak bk =\nP\n(ij) T\nT\nxi \u03b6s\u22121,x\nUj \u2212 rk=1 ak \u03b6s\u22121,x\nUk lies in KerMs (y). This implies 0 = P\u0303xi Uj \u2212\n(ij)\nT\nMs\u22121 (y)U a\nand thus U P\u0303xi Uj = U T Ms\u22121 (y)U a(ij) = MB a(ij) , which\nshows that the two matrices Pxi and MB Xxi have identical jth columns.\n4.4.5\n\nConstructing a basis for the ideal J := hKerMs (y)i\n\nA linear basis of KerMs (y). The simplest way of producing a basis for the\nideal J = hKerMs (y)i is simply by considering a linear basis of KerMs (y).\nSuch a basis can be found by using again a singular value decomposition\nfor Ms (y). Indeed, if Ms (y) = U \u03a3V \u2217 is the SVD, then the columns Vi of\nV corresponding to the zero diagonal entries of \u03a3 (the zero singular values\nof Ms (y)) form an orthonormal basis of KerMs (y). Then the polynomials\nT V corresponding to the zero singular values of M (y) form a basis of J.\n\u03b6s,x\ni\ns\nA drawback of this basis however is that it is usually highly overdetermined\nand has a large cardinality, equal to |Tn,s | \u2212 rankMs (y).\n\nA border basis. As shown in [40, Sec. 8.2, Ch. 10], it is desirable to\navoid overdetermined bases for J because it could lead to inconsistencies in\nthe basis for numerical reasons. To avoid this drawback, border bases are\nproposed in [40] and their numerical properties are investigated. If during\nthe construction of the formal multiplication matrices an order ideal basis\nB of K[x]/J was used, we deduce immediately a border basis consisting of\nthe polynomials\nr\nX\n(ij)\nxi bj \u2212\nak bk for xi bj \u2208 \u2202B.\n(4.14)\nk=1\n\n32\n\n\fA Gr\u00f6bner basis. If the monomial basis B of K[x]/J is the set of standard\nmonomials B\u227b with respect to a monomial ordering \u227b obtained, e.g., with\nthe greedy sieve algorithm, then the border basis in (4.14) is actually a\nGr\u00f6bner basis with respect to the monomial ordering \u227b. When \u227b is a graded\nmonomial ordering then, in view of Lemma 2.5, B\u227b \u2286 Tn,s and thus B\u227b can\nbe found with Algorithm 1 applied to (I(VK (I)), \u0017, s), using the following\nindependence oracle: a subset of Tn,s is independent in K[x]/I(VK (I)) if and\nonly if it indexes an independent set of columns of Ms (y). In general when\n\u227b is not a graded monomial ordering we are not assured to find B\u227b within\nTn,s . However we can proceed as follows. As Ms (y) is a flat extension\nof Ms\u22121 (y), by the results in Section 3.3, there exists an extension \u1ef9 \u2208\nn\nRNt (for any t \u2265 s) such that Mt (\u1ef9) is a flat extension of Ms (y). As\nhKerMs (y)i = hKerMt (\u1ef9)i = I(VR (I)), a subset of Tn,t is independent in\nK[x]/I(VK (I)) if and only if it indexes an independent set of columns of\nMt (\u1ef9). Thus to find B\u227b , apply Algorithm 1 iteratively to t = s + 1, s + 2, . . .\nuntil finding Bt = Bt+1 , in which case we know from Lemma 2.6 (ii) that\nB\u227b = Bt . Remains only to address the question on how to find the flat\nextension \u1ef9. The existence proof in [12] is constructive and can roughly be\nsketched as follows (see also [29] for details). Say we want to construct a flat\nextension C := Ms+1 (\u1ef9) of B := Ms (y), under the assumption that B is a\nflat extension of Ms\u22121 (y). We indicate how to construct the column C(*, \u03b3)\nof C indexed by a monomial x\u03b3 of degree s + 1. Write, say, x\u03b3 = xi x\u03b2 . By\n\u03b2\nassumption, the column\nP B(*, \u03b2) of B indexed by x can be expressed as a\nlinear combination\nP |\u03b1|\u2264s\u22121 \u03bb\u03b1 B(*, \u03b1) of columns indexed by Tn,s\u22121 ; then\ndefine C(*, \u03b3) as |\u03b1|\u2264s\u22121 \u03bb\u03b1 C(*, \u03b1 + ei ). Note that this construction relies\non the fact that the kernel of moment matrices enjoys ideal-like properties.\n4.4.6\n\nSummary of the algorithm\n\nAlgorithm 2 below summarizes our algorithm. This algorithm has been implemented in Matlab using the Yalmip toolbox [30]. For solving the semidefinite program (4.9) the semidefinite solver SeDuMi-1.05 [41, 42] is used. As\ndescribed above and can be seen in the examples in the next section, the\nrank detection is the most critical task. This was the main motivation for\nthe weaker conditions from Section 4.1, which extend the possibility of extracting solutions. In the examples below this deficiency is clearly indicated\nin some rank sequences not exactly matching the theory.\n\n5\n\nNumerical Examples\n\nWe present here the results of our algorithm applied to some examples,\nmainly taken from the literature. In each example, we specify the ideal I\nby its generators h1 , . . . , hm . Let us explain Tables 1-5 below.

Increase relaxation order\nt.\"\n12: end if\nRemark 4.17. In view of Propositions 4.6, 4.12, the algorithm terminates\nfor t large enough and finds J = I(VR (I)) or I(VC (I)). The algorithm can\nalso be used for testing existence of solutions. Let us give some details e.g.\nin the real case. If at step 1 one detects infeasibility of the SDP then one can\nalready conclude VR (I) = \u2205. Suppose now the SDP is feasible. At step 4, as\nobserved in Remark 4.8, the conditions of Proposition 4.4 cannot be met if\nVR (I) = \u2205, but it could be that the conditions of Proposition 4.1 or 4.2 are\nmet. In that case one can extract a set W \u2287 VR (I). Then one can simply\ntest whether the points of W satisfy the given equations h1 = . . . = hm = 0\nto detect whether VR (I) is empty or not.\n\n34\n\n\forder t, let y be the optimal solution to (4.9) returned by the SDP solver.\nThe abbreviations 'MON' and 'SVD' refer to using a monomial base of the\nquotient space, or a base found via the SVD method.\n\u2022 The column 'rank sequence' shows (rankM0 (y), . . . , rankMt (y)).\n\u2022 The column 'extract. order' shows some numbers smon (rmon )/ssvd (rsvd ).\nWhen using a monomial base, rmon is the smallest order at which the extraction procedure could be carried out and smon is the order at which it\nwas effectively carried out and gave the results reported here; analogously\nwith the SVD method.\n\u2022 The column 'accuracy' shows the accuracy of the returned solutions, i.e.,\nmaxj,x |hj (x)|, where hj runs over the generators of I and x over the extracted solutions.\n\u2022 The column 'comm. error' shows the commutativity error for the multiplication matrices, i.e., maxni,j=1 abs(Xxi Xxj \u2212 Xxj Xxi ) (where abs(M ) is\nthe maximum absolute value of the entries of a matrix M ). If the parameter 'comm. error' is more than 1e-2, the multiplication matrices do not\ncommute sufficiently and we then do not extract solutions.\nExample 5.1 This simple example from [11, p.40] has two roots, both\nreal.\nh1 = x42 x1 + 3x31 \u2212 x42 \u2212 3x21\n\nh2 = x21 x2 \u2212 2x21\n\nh3 = 2x42 x1 \u2212 x31 \u2212 2x42 + x21\n\norder\nt\n3\n4\n5\n\nrank sequence\n1359\n12227\n122228\n\nextract. order\nMON/SVD\n-\n4(2)/3(2)\n4(2)/4(2)\n\naccuracy\nMON/SVD\n-\n1.9717e-9/0.00013144\n2.9557e-8/3.5325e-5\n\ncomm. error\nMON/SVD\n-\n9.676e-10/3.3908e-6\n1.8781e-11/1.2291e-6\n\nTable 1: Results for Example 5.1\nMonomial basis of R[x]/I(VR (I)):\nB = {1, x1 }.\nBorder basis for I(VR (I)) (showing in bold the monomials in \u2202B):\ng1 = \u2212x1 + x21 ,\n\ng2 = \u22122x1 + x2 ,\n\ng3 = \u22122x1 + x1 x2 .\n35\n\n\fExtracted real solutions VR (I):\nx1 = (2.12e-8, 1.91e-6),\nx2 = (1, 2).\nThe first two polynomials g1 , g2 of the extracted border basis form a reduced\nGr\u00f6bner basis\n\u221awith respect to the graded reversed term order with x1 \u227a x2 .\nThe basis of I (= I(VR (I)) as all roots are real) given in [11] has the form:\n{x42 x1 + 3x31 \u2212 x42 \u2212 3x21 , x21 x2 \u2212 2x21 ,\n\n2x42 x1 \u2212 x31 \u2212 2x42 + x21 , x1 (x1 \u2212 1), x2 (\u22122 + x2 )}\n\nand is obtained via Seidenberg's method described in the paragraph 'Related\nliterature'\nin the Introduction.

The main feature of our approach is its real algebraic nature\nas it avoids considering complex zeros, and does not need to compute a\nGr\u00f6bner base of I. An essential step in our algorithm consists in solving the\nsemidefinite program (4.9). Thus our algorithm is numerical.\nLet us briefly mention the numerical versus numeric-symbolic (or arbitrary precision) issue. Some advocate that only computation with arbitrary\nor guaranteed precision should be permitted while others admit some numerical imprecision; see e.g. Revol and Rouillier [35], Stetter [40]. Clearly,\nbeing numerical in nature, the algorithm of the present paper admits some\nintrinsic numerical imprecision, no matter how good are (or will be) the\nSDP software packages. At this stage, the only answer we propose in this\n'approximate vs exact' debate is to validate or invalidate the method by experiments. For instance, on a significant sample, compute J \u2248 I(VR (I)) with\nour method and check afterwards by symbolic methods if VC (J) = VR (I).\nOn the other hand, the present algorithm is rather intended to illustrate\nthat the new semidefinite characterizations of VR (I) and I(VR (I)) are directly implementable in a relatively simple manner; clearly, its numerical\nfeatures (like precision and stability) need further investigations beyond the\nscope of the present paper.\n\nAcknowledgements.
