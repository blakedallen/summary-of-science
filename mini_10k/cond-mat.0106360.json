The resulting equivalent model in ferromagnetic phase has\na form of a version of the Faddeev model. This allows one in particular to conclude that spin-triplet\nsuperconductors allow formation of stable finite-length closed vortices (the knotted solitons).\n\nIn this paper we discuss spin-triplet superconductors\nand show that under certain conditions these superconductors should allow formation of stable finite-length solitons. The discussions of the stable finite-length solitons\nin 3+1 dimensions have a long history [1]-[8]. This concept was first discussed in mathematical physics: In ([1])\nL.D. Faddeev introduced a version of nonlinear O(3) \u03c3model which allows formation of the stable finite-length\nsolitons which may have a form of a knot or a vortex\nloop. The stability of these defects in the Faddeev model\nis ensured by a higher-order derivative term:\n\u0015\n\u0014\nZ\n1\n2\n~\n~\n(1)\nn\n)\nn\n\u00d7\n\u2202\n(~\nn\n*\n\u2202\nn |2 +\nHF = dr \u03b1|\u2202k ~\nj\ni\n4e2\nwhere ~n is a three-component unit vector.\nRecently it was realized that versions of this model\nare potentially relevant for description of many different physical systems ranging from infrared limit of QCD\nto superconductivity in transition metals [1]-[8]. Relevance of this model for condensed matter physics was\npointed out in Ref. [2] were it was found that in twoband superconductors there exists a mapping between\ntwo-flavour Ginzburg-Landau (GL) functional and a version of O(3)-symmetric Faddeev model. The knotted\nsolitons are much more complex and structurally complicated topological defects than Abrikosov vortices and\nthus its realization in superconductors should open exceptionally wide range of possibilities of studies of various phenomena associated with them. The remarkable\ncircumstance is that the studies of the properties of these\ndefects in superconductors may result in a \"feedback\" for\nthe discussions of properties of possible similar defects in\nthe infrared limit of QCD where it was argued that it\ndescribes glueballs [3].\nSo far the two-band superconductors were the only\nknown condensed matter system which is described by\na version of the Faddeev model and allows formation of\nthe knotted solitons [2]. In this paper we discuss presentation of the Ginzburg-Landau functional for a singlecondensate spin-triplet superconductor in gauge-invariant\nvariables by means of an exact duality mapping which\n\n\u2217 Email:\n\negor@teorfys.uu.se http://www.teorfys.uu.se/people/egor/\n\nalso leads to another version of the Faddeev model in\nferromagnetic state of the condensate. A remarkable\nfact which we observe below is that the resulting effective model for ferromagnetic spin-triplet superconductor\nis surprisingly similar to the model discussed in [2] albeit\nthe physical origin of this model in spin triplet superconductors is principally different from the model in [2].\nWe would like to emphasis that in a charged spin-1\nBose condensate the stable knotted solitons (which energy is a nonmonotonic function of its size) are the counterpart of the Volovik-Mineev vortices characterized by a\nnontrivial Hopf invariant in a neutral spin-1 superfluid\n(discussed in the pioneering papers on superfluid 3 He\n[9, 10, 11, 12]). The defects considered in [9, 10, 11, 12]\nhave similar topology but its energy is proportional to its\nsize and thus these defects are unstable against shrinkage.\nWe begin with reminding a reader some important features of the neutral spin-1 condensate following the paper\n[13]. This will be particularly helpful in the discussion\nof effects of coupling to gauge field and differences of the\nknotted solitons and Volovik-Mineev vortices.\nWe write the order\n\u221a parameter of the spin-1 Bose condensate as \u03a8a (r) = n(x)\u03b6a (x) where (a = 1, 0, \u22121) with\n\u03b6 being a normalized spinor \u03b6 \u2020 * \u03b6 = 1. Then the energy\nfunctional for a neutral spin-1 system can be written as\n[13]:\n\n\u221a\nh\u03042\nh\u03042\n(\u2207 n)2 +\nn(\u2207\u03b6)2 \u2212 \u03bcn\n2M\n2M\n\u0003\nn2 \u0002\nc0 + c2 < F > 2 ,\n+\n2\n\nK =\n\nZ\n\ndr\n\n(2)\n\nwhere < F >= \u03b6a\u2217 Fab \u03b6b is spin. Degenerate spinors\nare related to each other by gauge transformation ei\u03b8\nand spin rotations U(\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03c4 )=e\u2212iFz \u03b1 e\u2212iFy \u03b2 e\u2212iFz \u03c4 , where\n(\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03c4 ) are the Euler angles. The ground state structure\nof \u03a8a (r) can be found by minimizing the energy with\nfixed particle number [13]. Below we shall be mainly interested in ferromagnetic state. This state emerges when\nc2 < 0. The energy is minimized by < F >2 = 1 and the\n\n\f2\nground state spinor and density are [13]\n\n[compare with two-gap superconductor [2]]:\n\n\uf8eb \u2212i\u03b1 2 \u03b2 \uf8f6\n\uf8f6\n1\n\u221ae cos 2\n\u03b6 = ei\u03b8 U \uf8ed 0 \uf8f8 = ei(\u03b8\u2212\u03c4 ) \uf8ed 2cos \u03b22 sin \u03b22 \uf8f8\n0\nei\u03b1 sin2 \u03b22\n1\nno (r) =\n\u03bc\nc0 + c2\n\uf8eb\n\nBk = \u2212\n\n(3)\n\nFrom this equation it is seen that in ferromagnetic case\nthere exists an equivalence between gauge transformation\n\u03b8 and spin rotations \u03c4 so the symmetry group is SO(3)\n[13]. Given the expression for the ground state spinor (3)\none can immediately derive the superfluid velocity for a\nneutral spin-1 ferromagnetic Bose system [13]:\nv=\n\nh\u0304\n[\u2207(\u03b8 \u2212 \u03c4 ) \u2212 cos \u03b2\u2207\u03b1]\nM\n\n(4)\n\nLet us now turn to a charged spin-1 Bose condensate.\nWe have the following expression for the free energy of\nspin-1 superconductor in the \"ferromagnetic\" state:\n\"\n\u0013 2\n\u0012\nZ\n\u221a 2 h\u03042 n\nh\u03042\n2e\nF =\ndr\n(\u2207 n) +\n\u2207 + i A \u03b6a\n2M\n2M\nh\u0304c\n#\nB2\nn2\n(5)\n[c0 + c2 ] +\n\u2212 \u03bcn +\n2\n8\u03c0\nwith ground state spinor and density being given by (3).\nConsequently the equation for the supercurrent is:\n2\n\nJ =\n\nih\u0304en \u2217\n4e n\n(\u03b6a \u2207\u03b6a \u2212 \u03b6a \u2207\u03b6a\u2217 ) \u2212\nA=\nM\nMc\n4e2 n\n2h\u0304en\n[\u2207(\u03b8 \u2212 \u03c4 ) \u2212 cos \u03b2\u2207\u03b1] \u2212\nA\nM\nMc\n\n(6)\n\nFrom this equation it is clearly seen that the supercurrent depends not only on phase gradients but also on spin\ntexture what is in direct analogy with the situation in\nneutral case (4). However, the properties of the charged\nspin-1 condensate (in particular topological defects allowed by the system) are principally different from the\nneutral case that can be seen if we eliminate gauge field\nby a duality transformation to neutral variables which explicitly shows physical degrees of freedom in the system.\nSuch a mapping, which is actually different comparing to\nthe problem in Ref. [2], is discussed below.\nWe should emphasis that in the charged case (5) the\nfree energy features a contribution from magnetic field\nB2 /8\u03c0 which can be external or self-induced or both.\nWe also stress that we consider below a superconductor\nin a simply-connected space, that is, our defects do not\nfeature zeroes of the order parameter.

The remarkable\ncircumstance is that this effective model for a spin-triplet\nsuperconductor is very similar to the effective model for\ntwo-band superconductors where Cooper pairs have spin0 but the system possesses a hidden O(3)-symmetry [2]\nand can be described by means of a three-component\nunit \"pseudospin\" vector. The resulting model explicitly\ndisplays only physically relevant degrees of freedom and\nindeed does not depend on \u03b8, \u03c4 and A. The new variables are: n \u2261 |\u03a8|2 , the vector ~s which position on the\nunit sphere S 2 is characterized by the angles \u03b1 and \u03b2\n~ The effective action\n(8) and the massive vector field C.\ncontains fourth-order derivative term for the vector field\n~s. The field ~s is also coupled to the massive vector field\n~ Thus we can see that the properties of the charged\nC.\nspin-1 condensate are very different form the neutral condensate (2). Here we would like to stress that the procedure with which we arrived to (13) is the exact change of\nvariables with no approximations were used which means\nthat there exists the exact mapping between the models\n(13) and (5). The effective model (13) displays features\nof spin-triplet superconductors which can be easily overlooked in the presentation of the effective functional in\nthe form (5).\nIn particular, from (13) we can conclude that the system allows stable knotted solitons characterized by a nontrivial Hopf invariant which stability is ensured by the\nfourth-order derivative term (the Faddeev term). This\nterm is not explicitly present in the free energy functional in the Ginzburg-Landau form (5). It stems from\nthe term B2 /8\u03c0 and has the physical meaning of the selfinduced magnetic field in a presence of a nontrivial spin\ntexture (in this paper we discuss a system with no applied external fields). Indeed this effect is possible due to\nthe feature of the ferromagnetic state of p-wave condensate where the magnetic field may be induced by a spin\ntexture.\nSince the effective models for spin-triplet superconductor and two-band superconductor appear being formally\nvery similar we refer a reader to the paper [2] for a detailed description of the knotted solitons in the model\n(13), whereas below we outline differences of the properties of solitons in these systems. One of the differences is\nthat in the spin-triplet case the knot soliton may form as\na nontrivial texture with no inhomogeneities in Cooper\npair density. In particular that means that there is no\nmass of the components of the vector ~s whereas in twoband case [2] the n3 component of the unit vector ~n is related to relative local Cooper pair densities and is indeed\nmassive. In principle, in triplet case, the components of\nthe field ~s may also acquire a mass if to take into account\nspin-orbit interaction which would give ~s an energetically\npreferred direction, here we assume spin-orbit interaction\n~ Under\nto be small comparing with mass for the field C.\nthe assumption of small spin-orbit interaction the char-\n\nacteristic size of a knotted soliton is determined by a\ncompetition of the second-order and fourth-order derivative terms for ~s and thus it is of order of magnitude of\nmagnetic field penetration length [18].\nWe stress that in two-band superconductor [2], in the\npoints where the unit vector ~n is situated on the south or\nnorth poles of unit sphere S 2 , the densities of Cooper pair\nof flavour 1 or flavour 2 vanish correspondingly. Since a\nknot soliton is characterized by a Hopf invariant that\nmeans that the vector ~n necessary hits poles of the unit\nsphere which necessary results in zeroes of Cooper pairs\ndensities. Also the contribution to the self-induced magnetic field associated with the term ~n * \u2202i ~n \u00d7 \u2202j ~n vanishes in these areas. In contrast, the knotted soliton\nwith the same topology in spin-triplet superconductor is\na nontrivial configuration of spin texture and it does not\nfeature zeroes of density of Cooper pairs. When spinorbit interaction is small we can choose e.g. that the\nvector ~s assumes at infinity the value corresponding to\nthe north pole of the unit sphere and in the knot soliton core reaches the south pole. The configuration of the\nself-induced magnetic field associated with contribution\nof ~s * \u2202i~s \u00d7 \u2202j~s in spin-triplet case is following: the magnetic field vanishes indeed at spatial infinity (north pole\nof the unit sphere) and also the magnetic field vanishes\nin the knotted soliton \"core\" [19]. In between the core\nand \"knot boundary\" the self-induced magnetic field associated with the contribution of ~s * \u2202i~s \u00d7 \u2202j~s has a helical\ngeometry characterized by a corresponding Hopf invariant.\nThus the knot soliton in triplet superconductor has different structural features and different underlying physics\nthan the knotted solitons in two-gap superconductor albeit the main feature that these defects have in common\nis the self-induced nontrivial configuration of magnetic\nfield which amounts to a Faddeev term in the effective\naction and which stabilizes the size of the soliton. In\nother words a shrinkage of a knotted soliton would result in increasing energy of self-induced magnetic field\nwhich gives this defect energetic stability [compare with\n[1, 2, 3]].\nLet us also emphasis that the \"polar\" phase of triplet\nsuperconductors is not described by a version of the Faddeev model and does not allow formation of knotted solitons in contrast to the ferromagnetic phase. The properties of a neutral polar phase were investigated in [13].\nThis state appears in the case when c2 > 0. The energy\nis minimized by < F >= 0. The spinor \u03b6 in the ground\nstate was calculated in [13]. In a charged counterpart of\nthe system in the polar phase considered in [13], it can\nbe easily seen that the supercurrent does not depend on\nthe spin texture and this formally results in the absence\nof a Faddeev term in the effective action.\nIn conclusion, we derived an exact equivalent presentation of the free energy functional for ferromagnetic spintriplet superconductor. The derived functional in dual\n\n\f4\ngauge-invariant variables explicitly displays the physical\ndegrees of freedom in the system. In particular it allows us to conclude that the ferromagnetic spin-triplet\nsuperconductors allow formation of stable knotted solitons. This is in contrast to a neutral spin-1 condensate\nwhere the finite-length defects characterized by a nontrivial Hopf invariant are not energetically stable [9]-[12].\nThe amazing fact is that the derived model is very similar to the model considered in [2] despite it was derived\nfrom a very different Ginzburg-Landau functional. It\nshows that this version of the Faddeev model is a rather\ngeneric model for various superconductors. The interesting question is an experimental procedure how to create and observe the knotted solitons. Indeed in contrast\nto Abrikosov vortices these defects can not be created\nby simply applying an external magnetic field. On the\nother hand the situation is simplified by the key feature\nof these defects, which is, once they are formed they are\nstable being protected against decay by an energy barrier. One may expect that e.g. a rapid cooling of a\nsystem from above to below critical temperature in e.g.\napplied random fields should indeed result in a formation\nof a certian density of topological defects. Apparently an\nensemble of these defects, because of its complex structure, and very different nature comparing to Abrikosov\nvortices, should exhibit many unconventional phenomena and thus should be a very interesting object for experimental studies, especially since the triplet superconductivity has been established experimenally in several\ncompounds (e.g. U P t3 and Sr2 RuO4 [16]). Finally, we\nwould like to especially stress that it was suggested in\n[3] that knotted solitons could play an important role in\nthe infrared limit of QCD. The fact that similar defects\nshould be present in p-wave and two-band superconductors and the macroscopic quantum origin of the topological defects in condensed matter systems which implies its\nrather direct observability means that the spin-triplet superconductors along with two-band superconductors may\nin some sense serve as \"a testing laboratory\" for the infrared limit of QCD [17].\nIt is a great pleasure to thank Prof. G.

Indeed let us assume a knot is shrinking to a\ncharacteristic size smaller than the magnetic field penetration length \u03bb, then we have a nontrivial configuration\nof ~s which amounts to self-induced magnetic field configuration proportional to ~s * \u2207i~s \u00d7 \u2207j~s which becomes\nmore and more singular if the solition is shrinking. The\ndirection of this self-induced field also changes inside the\nknot since the configuration of ~s is helical and is characterized by a Hopf invariant. On the other hand the\nMeissner current C~ screens magnetic field in a superconductor over a characteristic length scale \u03bb thus if a texture ~s shrinks at characteristic sizes smaller than \u03bb we\nhave a fast variable ~s and a slow variable C~ over which\n\n\f5\nwe can average and thus at the length scales smaller than\n\u03bb the model reduced to the model (1) with an arbitrary\naccuracy thus the knot solitons in the model (13) are\nstable. This can be also understood intuitively: at the\nlength scales smaller than \u03bb the system almost does not\ndisplay Meissner effect and thus the screening current\ncannot affect the highly nontrivial configuration of self-\n\ninduced magnetic field proportional to ~s * \u2207i~s \u00d7 \u2207j~s.\n[19] We should emphasis that under the core of the knotted\nsoliton we understand here the closed line (which may\nform a loop or a knot) where the vector ~s reaches the\nsouth pole. There are no zeros of Cooper pair density in\nwhat we call here the \"core\".\n\n\f"}
