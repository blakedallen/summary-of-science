The intermediate regime, which is both AF and\ndimerized, is caused by a two-peak structure at ka=0.5\u03c0 (the Fermi surface). As U\nincreases both peaks approach each other, overlap, and separate again, the system\nbecoming metallic in the overlap region. This behavior can be traced to a site-parity\nchange of the ground state(GS), corresponding to a curve-crossing between two GS\nof different site parity.\nPACS numbers: 71.30,+h,71.10. Pm, 77.80.-e\n\nI.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nIn quasi-one dimensional materials like halogen-bridged transition metal chain complexes,\nconjugated polymers, organic charge transfer salts, or inorganic blue bronzes, the itinerancy\nof the electrons strongly competes with electron-electron and electron-phonon interactions\nwhich tend to localize the charge carriers by establishing commensurate spin or chargedensity wave ground states (GS). At half filling band (BI) or Mott (MI) insulating phases\nare favored over the metallic state. Quantum phase transitions between the insulating\nphases are possible and the character of the electron excitation spectra reflect the properties\nof the different GS. A controversial issue is the nature of the BI-MI transition as well as\nwhether or not only one critical point separates both insulating phases in purely electronic\nmodel Hamiltonians1,2 . Despite their importance in low dimensional materials3,4 phonon\n\n\f2\ndynamical effects will be ignored in this paper which will be concerned with the so-called\none dimensional (1D) ionic Hubbard model (IHM), just a Hubbard model with a staggered\npotential which displaces by \u2206 the energy levels of even and odd sites. It is described by\nthe Hamiltonian\n\nH = \u2212t\n\nX\n\n<ij>s\n\nc+\nis cjs\n\n\u0013\u0012\n\u0013\nX\u0012\n1\n1\n\u2206X\ni\n(\u22121) nis + U\nni\u2191 \u2212\nni\u2193 \u2212\n,\n+\n2 is\n2\n2\ni\n\n(1)\n\nwhere electrons of spin s = \u00b1 12 hop with amplitude t between nearest-neighbor inequivalent\nsites of energy level \u00b1 12 \u2206 ( \u2206 = 1 in what follows). Electrons of opposite spin on the same\nsite feel a repulsion U.\nThis model Hamiltonian, originally proposed by Nagaosa5 and later by Egami6 as a\nmodel ferroelectric, is ideal for studying the issue of quantum phase transitions in electron\nsystems. On general grounds one expects a transition to occur from an ionic band insulator\nto a strongly-correlated Mott insulator as U increases. Evidence for such a transition was\nfound in exact-diagonalization calculations by Resta et al1 predicting a metallic point at a\ncritical value U = Uc separating both insulating phases. This transition is signaled by a\npolarization jump with a sign change associated with a site parity change of the GS. The\nsame conclusion was supported by Gidopoulos et al7 , who showed the reversal of site parity\nabove to be of magnetic origin, thus leading to a vanishing of the spin gap, \u2206s = 0. Likewise,\nBrune et al8 by means of the bosonization technique along with Lanczos and density matrix\nrenormalization group (DMRG) calculations lent support to this picture.\nOn the other hand, Fabrizio et al2 shed new interest into the IHM in a field-theoretical\nbosonization analysis where they propose a new scenario for the intermediate region, U \u2243 \u2206,\nbetween the BI and the MI. The model should instead exhibit two quantum phase transitions:\none from a BI state to a long-range bond-ordered (BO) state predicted to be in the Ising\nuniversality class and a second one from the BO to the MI state predicted to be a KosterlitzThouless transition. Such transitions to BO states have recently been found in 1D Hubbard\nmodels with extended interactions (U-V) by Nakamura9 . The BO state is a broken symmetry\nstate in which the system becomes ferroelectric due strictly to electron-electron interactions\neven if all the atoms are at centers of inversion. This is also called the spontaneously\ndimerized insulating (SDI) phase, which, as argued by Fabrizio et al2 , implies a finite spin\ngap, \u2206s \u227b 0. Such a SDI phase has been observed numerically by Wilkens and Martin10\n\n\f3\nin a variational quantum Monte Carlo study. More precisely, they found one transition\nfrom the BI to the correlated SDI phase, but no second transition to the MI phase which\nis approached asymptotically by the SDI phase as U \u2192 \u221e. Recent DMRG calculations11,12\nlead to mutually conflicting results. Thus whereas Takada and Kido11 support the Resta et\nal1 picture of a single first-order transition, Qin et al12 support the Fabrizio et al2 scenario\nof two second-order quantum phase transitions.\nIn this paper we present the one-electron spectral-weight function A(k\u03c9) of the IHM.\nThe calculation is done by means of a Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulation in the\ngrand canonical ensemble suplemented by an approximate effective action. Its eigenvalues\nand eigenvectors alow us to construct explicitly dynamic correlation functions in real time or\nfrequency. This procedure leads to spectral functions with a reasonably high resolution. The\ncalculation is performed at a relatively large inverse temperature, \u03b2t = 10 (t = 1 in what\nfollows), which brings the system very close to its GS properties. Our calculated A(k\u03c9)clearly\nshows metallic character (non-vanishing density of states in the gap) at ka = 0.5\u03c0 (a = 1),\nbetween two critical U values instead of a single metallic point at the first threshold. Thus a\ndouble BI-M-MI smooth transition is predicted, the intermediate metallic regime at U\u2243 2\u2206\nbeing both antiferromagnetic (AF) and dimerized\n\nII.\n\nEFFECTIVE HAMILTONIAN AND CORRELATION FUNCTIONS\n\nIn our calculations, we use the QMC approach in the grand canonical ensemble, which has\nbeen explained in detail by Hirsch13,14 and White et al15 . As is well-known, the partition\nfunction is factorized into L time slices of extent \u2206\u03c4 = \u03b2/L. For Hubbard models, the\nP\ninteraction U i ni\u2191 ni\u2193 is transformed into a discrete Ising field13 , \u03c3il = \u00b11, which depends\n\non lattice site i and imaginary time \u03c4 = l\u2206\u03c4 (l = 1, .....L). The non-interacting Hamiltonian\nfor a given Ising configuration (a definite allocation of +1 and \u22121 values for all the \u03c3il is)\nreads14\nH(\u03c4 ) =\n\nX\n\ns\nc+\nis hij {\u03c3i (\u03c4 )} cjs \u2261 Hl\n\n(2)\n\n<ij>s\n\nwhere\nhsij\n\n\u0013\n\u0012\nU\ni\n{\u03c3i (\u03c4 )} = tij + \u2206 (\u22121) + \u2212 \u03bc + \u03bb\u03b1\u03c3il \u03b4ij\n2\n\n(3)\n\n\f4\nThe first term on the rhs of Eq(3) is just the hopping term of the IHM, Eq(1). In the second\nterm, \u03bc is the chemical potential, \u03b1 = \u00b11 for up/down electron spin, and \u03bb is a non- linear\nfunction of U given by cosh \u03bb\u2206\u03c4 = exp (U\u2206\u03c4 /2).In the limit \u2206\u03c4 \u2192 0 the partition function\ncan be written as\nZ=\n\nX\n\nT r \u03a0l e\u2212\u2206\u03c4 Hl =\n\n<\u03c3>\n\nwhere\n\nP\n\n<\u03c3>\n\nX\n\nT r e\u2212\u2206\u03c4\n\nP\n\nl\n\nHl\n\n=\n\nX\n\nT r e\u2212\u03b2(K+V )\n\n(4)\n\n<\u03c3>\n\n<\u03c3>\n\nmeans summing over the Ising configurations and T rdenotes taking the trace\n\nover the electron degrees of freedom. K is the \u03c4 -independent part of H(\u03c4 ) and\nV =\n< \u03c3i >= (1/L)\n\nP\n\ni\n\nX\n\u03bbX\n\u03c3il (ni\u2191 \u2212 ni\u2193 ) = \u03bb\n< \u03c3i > (ni\u2191 \u2212 ni\u2193 )\nL il\ni\n\n(5)\n\n\u03c3il being the average Ising spin at the i-th site. Therefore, Hef f = K + V\n\nis \u03c4 -independent in the limit \u2206\u03c4 \u2192 0. We adopt this effective \u03c4 -independent Hamiltonian,\nfor doing measurements even if the number of time slices used in the calculation is finite.\nTo minimize as much as possible size effects due to a finite L, we shall increase L and seek\nfor convergence. Needless to say, the update of the Ising field is done following the standard\nprocedure of, say, Ref 15.\nThe corresponding Hamiltonian matrix for each spin s (Eq(3) with < \u03c3 >instead of\n< \u03c3il >) is now diagonalized and, in terms of its eigenvalues \u03b5\u03bcs and eigenvectors | \u03bcs >, we\ncan construct correlation functions in real time or frecuency. For instance\n\u001b\n\u001a\nX\nf\u03bcs\n1 \u2212 f\u03bcs\ns<\ns\n< \u03bcs | j >= Gs>\n+\n< i | \u03bcs >\nGij (\u03c9) =\nij (\u03c9)+Gij (\u03c9) (6)\n\u03c9\n\u2212\n\u03b5\n+\ni\u03b7\n\u03c9\n\u2212\n\u03b5\n\u2212\ni\u03b7\n\u03bcs\n\u03bcs\n\u03bc\nfor the causal Green's functions and likewise for other quantities. As customary, f\u03bcs =\n\u0001\u22121\ne\u03b2\u03b5\u03bcs + 1 is the Fermi-Dirac distribution and \u03b7 a vanishingly small imaginary part. All\nthese quantities must now be averaged over the accepted Ising configurations to obtain the\nfinal result. It is just in this averaging process where the correlation effects are restored.\nSince the final result is translationally invariant, one can Fourier transform and find the\nspectral-weight function (SWF)\n1\n<\nAks (\u03c9) = \u2212 Im {G>\nks (\u03c9) \u2212 Gks (\u03c9)} ,\n\u03c0\n\n(7)\n\nand the DOS\nNs (\u03c9) =\n\n1 X\nAks (\u03c9)\nN k\u2032\n\n(8)\n\n\f5\nwhich can also be obtained from (6) as (1/N)\n\nP\n\ni\n\nNi (\u03c9), Ni (\u03c9) being the corresponding\n\nimaginary part of Gsii (\u03c9). For our case of the IHM, this last route allows to calculate the\npartial DOS for even/odd atoms by simply restricting the sum over even/odd sites. As\nnoticed earlier, this building procedure leads to a good resolution of spectral features.\n\nIII.\n\nDOUBLE INSULATOR-METAL-INSULATOR TRANSITION\n\nWe characterize the system by its one-electron SWF, Ak (\u03c9), along with the charge and\nspin structure factors, ck and sk , defined as the Fourier transform of the static charge and\nspin, respectively, correlation functions. These are given as usual by cij =< qi qj > and\nsij =< siz sjz >, qi = ni\u2191 +ni\u2193 and siz = (1/2)(ni\u2191 \u2212ni\u2193 ) being the charge and spin at the i\u2212th\nsite and \u03c4 = 0. This type of characterization is useful and can be of help in understanding\nthe electronic properties of a system. For instance, the SWF tells us the presence or absence\nof gaps or pseudogaps as U increases, which is of fundamental importance in establishing\nthe insulating or metallic character and possible transitions between them of, say, the IHM.\nLikewise, the evolution of ck and sk with U, especially theirs peak at k = \u03c0, gives information\nabout the charge or magnetic origin of the transitions.\n\nA.\n\nThe spectral-weight function.\n\nAs hinted before, it is just the structure of Ak (\u03c9) at k = \u03c0/2 which accounts for the\ninsulating or metallic character of the IHM. Hence, Fig 1 shows this quantity for three\nvalues of U (recall that t = 1) so selected to exhibit the three fundamental regimes of the\nmodel. The calculation has been done for a chain of eighty sites with periodic boundary\nconditions at half filling and \u03b2 = 10. Typically 150 time slices, two hundred warm sweeps\nand one thousand measurements were taken. At U = 1, a two-peak structure with a clear\ngap in between signals an insulating system. At U = 2.25, both peaks have overlapped\ndeveloping a third peak just at the midpoint of the gap (which becomes the Fermi level).\nThis three-peak structure clearly shows a metallic system. Finally, at U = 4 the central\npeak splits into two peaks leaving a gap in between. This four-peak structure signals again\nan insulating system which must be somehow of a different kind from the initial one (see\nbelow). As U increases (not shown) the central gap widens and the four peaks go over into\n\n\f6\n\nFIG. 1: The spectral-weight function Ak (\u03c9) for k = \u03c0/2 and U/t (t=1) values lying in the three\ncoupling regimes of the ionic Hubbard model. The QMC calculation has been made for a periodic\nchain of eighty sites an \u03b2 = 10\n\na two-peak structure as U \u2212\u2192 \u221e, the system becoming then a Mott insulator.\nIn order to estimate the approximate extension of the metallic region, Fig 2 shows the\nevolution of the spectral density at k = \u03c0/2 and \u03c9 = 0 (the midgap) as U increases. We see\na maximum at Um = 2.25 an onset threshold at U1 \u2243 1.75 and a falloff with an approximate\nendpoint at U2 = 2.75 eV leaving a zone of metallicity U2 \u2212 U1 = 1. Since this quantity may\nbe size-dependent, we proceed to a finite-size scaling in order to approach the thermodynamic\nlimit. Calculations made on chains of 8,12,16,80,120, and 160 sites show that U2 \u2212 U1 = 1 is\nroughly independent of size, but Um tends to go up, extrapolating to 2.50 when 1/N \u2212\u2192 0.\nNotice that only finite chains of N = 4m sites should be used since only them have k = \u03c0/2\nas an allowed wave vector. Chains of other lengths fail to detect the metallicity. In the\nthermodynamic limit, of course, all chains have a wawe vector infinitessimally close to \u03c0/2\nThe three-peak structure responsible of the metallic phase disappears as soon as one\n\n\f7\n\nFIG. 2: Ak (\u03c9) at k = \u03c0/2 (a=1) and E=0 (midgap which becomes the Fermi level) as U increases.\nSame calculations of Fig. 1\n\ndeparts from k = \u03c0/2, showing a single mainly occupied peak at k = (\u03c0/2) \u2212 \u03b4 and a mainly\nempty peak at k = (\u03c0/2) + \u03b4 ( \u03b4 = 2\u03c0/N, N being the number of sites). Hence the metallic\npeak should be visible in angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy and its inverse, but not\nin integrated measurements which give the DOS, Eq (8). Since the weight of that structure\nfalls with N (Fig 3), only a pseudogap with a sizeable DOS at the Fermi levels should be\nseen.\n\nB.\n\nThe charge and spin structure factors\n\nFig 4 finally displays the evolution of the peak of ck and sk at k = \u03c0 for increasing U.\nThe charge factor consistently drops from a high value at U = 1, which signals a strong\nCDW in correspondence with a large ionicity (the fractional ionic character of the bond is\n\n\f8\n\nFIG. 3: Density of states for the same chain as Fig 1 for U and number of sites N=8,12,16 and 80.\n\nF IC = 0.32) which also falls down monotonically. The system, therefore starts as an ionic\nband insulator at small U. The spin structure factor starts close to zero, corresponding to\na paramagnetic insulator, and monotonically increases with U, signaling an AF SDW of\nincreasing amplitude. For large U, the systems evolves into a Mott insulator with a strong\nAF SDW and a vanishingly small CDW, i.e., zero ionicity (neutral).\nIn the intermediate regime, U1 < U2 , the system is both increasingly AF and neutral\n(decreasing ionicity, i.e., decreasing CDW). On the other hand, Table I displays a small\nsector of the density matrix (nsij =< c+\nis cjs >), for U = 2.25 just the top and left 4 \u00d7 4\nmatrix, which is sufficient to show that the metallic state of this intermediate regime is\ndimerized. Thus ns12 > ns23 , etc, indicating that the sites (12), (34), and so on, form dimers.\nThese dimers weaken for U > U2 and tends to disappear as U \u2192 \u221e\n\n\f9\n\nFIG. 4: The peak at k = \u03c0 of the charge, ck (triangles), and the spin, sk (circles), structure factor,\nas U increases, for the 80-sites periodic chain.\n\nIV.\n\nCONCLUDING REMARKS\n\nOur QMC study shows three coupling regimes in the ionic Hubbard model: (i) An ionic\nband insulator below U = U1 .(ii) An increasingly antiferromagnetic and dimerized metal\nwhich is gradually becoming neutral in the intermediate coupling regime U1 < U < U2 . And\n(iii) an increasingly AF and neutral insulator whose dimerization, measured by n12 \u2212 n23 , is\ngradually dropping away for U > U2 . This last regime tends to a Mott insulator a U \u2192 \u221e.\nA remark is here in order. Although the spectral-weight function at k = \u03c0/2 seems to\nhint a critical separation among the three coupling regimes (a threshold and an endpoint),\nthe smooth behavior of all the integrated quantities (DOS, ionicity, energy, charge and spin\nstructure factors, etc.) rather suggest a smooth interpolation between the three regimes\nwhich should be distinguished from true quantum phases with sharp, critical, separation\namong them.\n\n\f10\nTo conclude, let us finally say that the results of our QMC calculations would be quite\nsimilar to those of Resta et al1 , Wilkens and Martin10 ,etc, if the metallic zone reduced to a\nsingle point. On the other hand, they would also be quite close to those of Fabrizio et al2\nshould the intermediate regime reported in this letter turn out to be insulating.\nWe acknowledge the financial support of the Spanish DGICYT through Project NPB\n98-0683\n\n\u2217\n\nElectronic address: refolio@imaff.cfmac.csic.es\n\n1\n\nR.
