Practically every theoretical attempt to connect general relativity to the standard model allows for\na violation of the equivalence principle[1]. Equivalence\nprinciple tests are therefore important tests of unification\nscale physics far beyond the reach of traditional particle\nphysics experiments. The puzzling discoveries of dark\nmatter and dark energy provide strong motivation to extend tests of the equivalence principle to the highest precision possible.\nOver the past two decades we have conducted laboratory tests of the equivalence principle[2, 3, 4, 5]. This\nletter reports our latest and most precise measurement\nusing a new, continuously-rotating torsion balance. The\ntorsion balance compares the horizontal accelerations of\ntest bodies made from two different materials. Acceleration differences that depend only on the test-body material violate the equivalence principle. We parameterize such equivalence-principle violating interactions by a\nYukawa potential, which for two point objects is\nq\nq m1 m2 \u2212r12 /\u03bb\nV (r) = \u03b1G( )1 ( )2\ne\n,\n\u03bc \u03bc\nr12\n\n(1)\n\nwhere the interaction range \u03bb = h/(mb c) is given by the\nCompton wavelength of the presumed exchange boson of\nmass mb , and which couples to the \"new charge\" q. The\ncoupling strength \u03b1 is measured in units of the Newtonian gravitational constant G, and \u03bc represents the\nmass in atomic mass units. The instrument consists of a\nhighly sensitive torsion balance that is continuously rotated by a turntable. The torsion balance is composed\nof a material-composition dipole pendulum suspended by\na fine tungsten wire. Any material-dependent acceleration on the composition dipole pendulum to objects not\non the turntable produces a periodic twist of the torsion\nfiber. The twist angle, \u0398, was recorded using a corotating autocollimator. The phase and frequency of the\nsinusoidal variation of \u0398 allowed us to search for differential accelerations towards terrestrial and astronomical\nsources.\n\nFigure 1 shows a schematic drawing of the apparatus\nand the 70.3 g pendulum. The pendulum body is a thin\naluminum shell with fourfold azimuthal symmetry and\nup down reflection symmetry. It carries four beryllium\nand four titanium test masses in a horizontal dipole configuration. These two materials were chosen primarily\nto maximize the difference in baryon number (B/\u03bc is\n0.99868 for Be and 1.001077 for Ti), and secondly for\nexperimental reasons, such as densities, magnetic properties and machinability. The Ti test bodies are hollow\nto match the external shape and mass of the 4.84 g Be\ntest bodies to within 50 \u03bcg. The test body shape allows\nus to reproducibly interchange the test bodies, to minimize alignment errors, and to equalize their gravitational\ninteraction. The optical beam of the autocollimator is reflected from one of four mirrors located at the pendulum's\nmidplane. The entire pendulum and all surfaces near the\npendulum are plated with \u2248 300 nm of gold.\nThe 1.07 m long torsion fiber is a 20 \u03bcm thick tungsten\nwire with a torsion constant of \u03ba = 2.34 \u00d7 10\u22129 Nm/rad\nyielding a free torsional oscillation period of T0 = 798 s\nand a quality factor Q = 5000 \u00b1 200. The top of\nthe torsion fiber is attached to an eddy-current swing\nand vibration damper and tilt isolator. This assembly\ncan be rotated with respect to the vacuum chamber by\na small rotation stage. The vacuum is maintained at\n\u2248 10\u22125 Pa by an ion pump. The pendulum is surrounded\nby three layers of \u03bc-metal shielding on the rotating platform and one non-rotating \u03bc-metal shield. To reduce the\nsensitivity to temperature fluctuations and gradients a\nthermally-isolated copper tube inside the vacuum surrounds the fiber, the aluminum-vacuum chamber is surrounded by several layers of rotating and non-rotating\nthermal shields and insulation. The entire instrument is\nin a Styrofoam enclosure and the apparatus is located in\na temperature-stabilized underground room.\nThe turntable, below which the torsion balance is attached, is made from a custom-built aluminum air bearing [6]. The turntable rotation rate is controlled using feedback to an optical angle encoder with two read\n\n\f2\n\nFIG. 1: Cross section of the apparatus (upper part). The\nentire torsion balance is suspended below a continuously rotating turntable. Gravity gradient compensator masses were\nplaced around the pendulum to reduce coupling to ambient\ngravitational gradients. The pendulum (lower part) carries\nfour Ti and four Be masses in a composition dipole.\n\nheads. The loop is realized by a digital signal processor\ncontrolling an eddy-current drive. The constancy of the\nrotation rate was limited by the angle encoder's linearity. Angle encoder imperfections were mapped by operating the torsion balance at rotation periods Tt \u226a T0\nand the corrections were included in the feedback algorithm. The turntable rotation frequency was normally set\nto \u03c9t /(2\u03c0) = 2/3 T0\u22121 = 0.835 mHz, where the signalto-noise ratio was found to be optimal. The pendulum's\nangular position and the signals of 31 sensors for temper-\n\nature, tilt, etc. were recorded every 2.76 s.\nGravitational forces between our pendulum and local\ngravitational gradients can occur at the signal frequency.\nTo minimize coupling to ambient gravitational field gradients, Ql1 , the pendulum was highly symmetrical, with\nthe nominal mass moments, ql1 , vanishing for l < 7.\nIn addition, the pendulum's q20 , q30 and q40 moments\nwere designed to be zero to avoid gravitational coupling\ndue to a small misalignments of the pendulum [3]. The\nambient Q21 and Q31 fields at the pendulum's position\nwere compensated with 888 kg of lead and 8.8 kg of aluminum, respectively. Lead bricks placed about 1 m from\nthe pendulum were used to null the remnant Q21 -field.\nThe gradient fields were measured with a special gradiometer pendulum that was configured to have either a\nlarge q21 or q31 moment. We found that the Q21 -field\nvaried by as much as \u00b11% during a year, which we attribute to changes of the water table. Once the equivalence principle pendulum was installed, its residual q21 and q31 -moments were measured by rotating the Q21 - and\nQ31 -compensators by 180\u25e6 , doubling the uncompensated\nfields. The pendulum's unwanted mass moments were\nthen minimized by adjusting four screws on the pendulum body until only a small gravitational coupling remained (see Table I), which was later subtracted from\nthe data.\nThe turntable must rotate about local vertical since a\ntilt of the attachment point of the torsion fiber causes a\nsmall apparent rotation of the pendulum. The tilt of the\nturntable was continuously measured with level sensors\non the rotating platform. The once-per-revolution component of the tilt was minimized by a feedback loop that\nchanged the length of two of the turntable's support legs\nby controlling their temperature with Peltier elements.\nThis system nulled the periodic tilt of the level sensor\nto within \u00b13 nrad. At the pendulum body, 1.7 m below the feedback sensor, local vertical was different by\n55 nrad and a correction to the data was required. We\ninferred this tilt by using a second tilt sensor 0.2 m below\nthe pendulum. We also found the change in local vertical consistent with our local mass integration. The data\nwere corrected using the tilt at the pendulum and a tilt\nmatrix characterizing the tilt sensitivity. The tilt matrix\nwas measured for all four pendulum mirrors by deliberately tilting the turntable rotation axis. The magnitude\nof the tilt matrix ranged from \u2248 1% to \u2248 7% depending\non the mirror.\nThe largest entry in our error budget arises from systematic and statistical uncertainties associated with temperature gradients and fluctuations. We assessed the sensitivity to temperature gradients by placing temperaturecontrolled panels on opposite sides of the apparatus to\nproduce exaggerated thermal gradients. The quoted uncertainty is limited by sensor noise in resolving the small\ntemperature gradients that occurred during equivalence\nprinciple data taking. By applying a magnetic field and\n\n\f3\nfield gradients using coils, as well as strong permanent\nmagnets, we found the magnetic coupling to be small\n(Table I).\n\nFIG. 2: Shown are measured differential accelerations towards North (top) and West. After the first four data runs\nthe Be and Ti test bodies were interchanged on the pendulum\nframe. A violation of the equivalence principle would appear\nas a difference in the means (lines) of the two data sets. The\noffset acceleration is due to systematic effects that follow the\npendulum frame but not the composition dipole. The data\nhave been corrected for tilt and gravity gradients, but only\nthe statistical uncertainties are shown.\n\nTABLE I: The raw differential accelerations between Be and\nTi towards North (N)and West (W) are shown in line 1.

The orientation of the pendulum with respect\nto the vacuum chamber was changed by 180\u25e6 once a day,\nmostly to cancel the effect of small turntable rotation\nrate imperfections. Approximately biweekly we changed\nthe orientation of the pendulum by 90\u25e6 and took data\nusing opposite mirrors. Between the two sets, we interchanged the test bodies with those on the other side of\nthe pendulum, reversing the composition dipole on the\npendulum frame to eliminate spurious signals associated\n\nwith the torsion fiber, the pendulum body, or the magnetic damper. An equivalence principle violation would\ncause a difference in the measured acceleration of the two\nsets (Fig. 2).\nOur data analysis began by using a digital notch filter to remove the pendulum's free torsional oscillation.\nThe data were then divided into segments containing 2\nturntable revolutions (\u2248 2400 s). Nine harmonics of the\nturntable rotation frequency, an offset, a linear and a\nquadratic drift were fitted to the data in each segment.\nAbout 7% of the segments were excluded from the analysis due to spikes in the ion pump current or due to abrupt\nchanges of the turntable axis from local vertical. The coefficients of the sin (\u03c9t t) and cos (\u03c9t t) terms were used to\nextract the signals of interest and their scatter was used\nto determine the statistical uncertainty. The pendulum\ndata were corrected in amplitude and phase for the pendulum's dynamic response to external torques and for\nelectronic attenuation and time delays. After correcting\nfor systematic effects (Table I), the data were reduced to\nmaterial-dependent differential acceleration components\nalong North and West directions. Figure 2 shows these\ncomponents for six data runs. We observed a small unexplained offset in the East-West direction that followed the\nsuspension system (pendulum body, torsion fiber, swing\ndamper) but the signals tracking the composition dipole\nwere unresolved in all directions.\nThe composition dependent accelerations are\naN (Be) \u2212 aN (Ti) = (0.6 \u00b1 3.1) \u00d7 10\u221215 m/s2 and\naW (Be) \u2212 aW (Ti) = (\u22122.5 \u00b1 3.5) \u00d7 10\u221215 m/s2\nwith titanium being more attracted to the South and to\nthe West. Our best limit on the classical equivalence\nprinciple parameter[7] \u03b7 is\n\u03b7(Be \u2212 Ti) =\n\n\u2206aN\n= (0.3 \u00b1 1.8) \u00d7 10\u221213 .\nag\u22a5\n\n(2)\n\nFigure 3 shows the limits on the strength, \u03b1, of a new\ninteraction (Eq. 1) as a function of range \u03bb. To establish these limits we used the mass density and charge\ncontent of the environment surrounding the torsion balance to create a source model. For \u03bb = 1 \u2212 100 m the\nsource is dominated by a hill sloping towards the East.\nFor \u03bb < 10 km the local topography and bedrock become\nsignificant. At ranges between 10 km and 1000 km, preliminary results using large scale density and composition models indicate that the limit on \u03b1 is better than\nthe dashed line shown in Fig. 3. A detailed description of\nthe model and limits will be included in a future publication. We used an elliptical layered Earth model[3, 8, 9]\nfor \u03bb > 1000 km. For this range the source mass is located towards the North.\nEquivalence-principle violating interactions associated\nwith an astronomical source are additionally modulated\n\n\f4\nby a solar or sidereal frequency:\n\u0001\n\u2206aN = cos \u03b8 \u2212 \u2206a cos (\u03c6 \u2212 \u03c60 ) \u2212 \u2206\u00e3 sin (\u03c6 \u2212 \u03c60 ) +oN ,\n\u0001\n\u2206aW = cos \u03b8 \u2206a sin (\u03c6 \u2212 \u03c60 ) \u2212 \u2206\u00e3 cos (\u03c6 \u2212 \u03c60 ) +oW ,\nwith \u03b8 and \u03c6 being the altitude and azimuth of the astronomical source, \u2206a the differential acceleration towards\nthe source and \u2206\u00e3 its quadrature component; oN and\noW are possible instrument offsets.

A simultaneous fit of \u2206aN and \u2206aW towards the galactic center\nyields\na(Be) \u2212 a(T i) = \u2206a = (\u22122.1 \u00b1 3.1) \u00d7 10\u221215 m/s2 ,\n\u00e3(Be) \u2212 \u00e3(T i) = \u2206\u00e3 = (2.7 \u00b1 3.1) \u00d7 10\u221215 m/s2 .\nSince only about a quarter of the total acceleration of the\nsolar system towards the center of our galaxy is caused\nby galactic dark matter [10], we find \u03b7DM,Be\u2212T i = (\u22124 \u00b1\n7) \u00d7 10\u22125 .\nWith 95% confidence we constrain space-fixed differential accelerations in any direction to be smaller than\n\u2206a = 8.8 \u00d7 10\u221215 m/s2 .\n\nFIG. 4: The averaged differential acceleration of Be and\nTi towards North and West as a function of sidereal time.\nThe dashed line represents a hypothetical signal of 20 \u00d7\n10\u221215 m/s2 . The solid line is the best fit toward the galactic\ncenter (\u2206a = (\u22122.1 \u00b1 3.1) \u00d7 10\u221215 m/s2 ).\n\nSchmidt, Tom Butler and Chris Spitzer have contributed\nto the apparatus development.\n\nFIG. 3: New upper limits on Yukawa interactions coupled to\nbaryon number with 95% confidence. The uncertainties in\nthe source integration is not included in this plot. The numbers indicate references. The shaded region is experimentally\nexcluded. Preliminary models for 10 km < \u03bb < 1000 km\nindicate that the limit on \u03b1 is smaller than the dashed line.\n\nWe have substantially improved the limits on the\nstrength of an equivalence-principle violating, long-range\ninteraction. We are currently broadening our search by\nusing other test-body materials and improving the sensitivity of our torsion balance.\nThis work was supported by NSF Grants PHY0355012,\nPHY0653863 and by NASA Grant NNC04GB03G, and\nDOE funding for the CENPA laboratory.
