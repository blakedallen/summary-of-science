The goal of this paper is to study properties\nof solutions to this equation resulting from the interplay between the strengths\nof the \"diffusive\" linear and \"hyperbolic\" nonlinear terms, posed in the whole\nspace IRN , and supplemented with nonnegative, bounded, and sufficiently regular\ninitial conditions.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe well-known Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equation ht = \u03bd\u2206h+ \u03bb2 |\u2207h|2 was derived in\n[19] as a model for growing random interfaces. Recall that the interface is parameterized\n2000 Mathematics Subject Classification: 35K55, 35B40, 60H30.\nKey words and phrases: nonlinear evolution equation, L\u00e9vy anomalous diffusion, self-similar\nasymptotics, surface transport\n\n1\n\n\f2\n\nG. Karch & W.A. Woyczy\u0144ski\n\nhere by the transformation \u03a3(t) = (x, y, z = h(x, y, t)), so that h = h(x, y, t) is the\nsurface elevation function, \u03bd > 0 is identified in [19] as a \"surface tension\" or \"high\ndiffusion coefficient\", \u2206 and \u2207 stand, respectively, for the usual Laplacian and gradient\ndifferential operators in spatial variables, and \u03bb \u2208 IR scales the intensity of the ballistic\nrain of particles onto the surface.\nAn alternative, first-principles derivation of the KPZ equation (cf. [21], for more\ndetailed information and additional references) makes three points:\n(a) The Laplacian term can be interpreted as a result of the surface transport of\nadsorbed particles caused by the standard Brownian diffusion;\n(b) In several experimental situations a hopping mechanism of surface transport is\npresent which necessitates augmentation of the Laplacian by a nonlocal term modeled\nby a L\u00e9vy stochastic process;\n(c) The quadratic nonlinearity is a result of truncation of a series expansion of a\nmore general, physically justified, nonlinear even function.\nThese observations lead us to consider in this paper a nonlinear nonlocal equation\nof the form\nut = \u2212Lu + \u03bb|\u2207u|q ,\n(1.1)\nwhere the L\u00e9vy diffusion operator L is defined as\nLv(x) = \u2212\n\nN\nX\n\nj,k=1\n\nQj,k\n\n\u2202 2 v(x)\n+\n\u2202xj \u2202xk\n\nZ\n\nIRN\n\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\nv(x) \u2212 v(x + y) \u2212 y * \u2207v(x)1I{|y|<1}(y) \u03a0(dy). (1.2)\n\nThe matrix {Qj,k }N\nj,k=1 in (1.2) is assumed to be a nonnegative-definite; if it is not\ndegenerate, a linear change of the variables transforms the first term in (1.2) into the\nusual Laplacian \u2212\u2206 on IRN which corresponds to the Brownian part of the diffusion\nmodeled by L. The second term on the right-hand side of (1.2) models the hopping\nphenomena and is determined by the Borel measure \u03a0, usually called the L\u00e9vy measure\nR\nof the stochastic process, such that \u03a0({0}) = 0, and IRn min(1, |y|2) \u03a0(dy) < \u221e. One\ncould also include on the right-hand side a drift term b * \u2207v, where b \u2208 IRN is a fixed\nvector but, for the sake of the simplicity of the exposition, we omit it. All necessary\nassumptions and properties of L\u00e9vy diffusion operators, as well as the semigroups of\nlinear operators generated by \u2212L, are gathered at the beginning of the next section.\nRelaxing the assumptions that led to quadratic expression in the classical KPZ\nequation, the nonlinear term in (1.1) has the form\n\u0010\n\n\u03bb|\u2207u|q = \u03bb |\u2202x1 u|2 + ... + |\u2202xN u|2\n\n\u0011q/2\n\n,\n\nwhere q is a constant parameter. To study the interaction of the \"strength\" of the\nnonlocal L\u00e9vy diffusion parametrized by the L\u00e9vy measure \u03a0, with the \"strength\" of\nthe nonlinear term, parametrized by \u03bb and q, we consider in (1.1) the whole range,\n1 < q < \u221e, of the nonlinearity exponent.\n\n\fFractional Hamilton-Jacobi-KPZ equations\n\n3\n\nFinally, as far as the intensity parameter \u03bb \u2208 IR is concerned, we distinguish two\ncases:\n\u2022 The deposition case: Here, \u03bb > 0 characterizes the intensity of the ballistic\ndeposition of particles on the evolving interface,\n\u2022 The evaporation case: Here, \u03bb < 0, and the model displays a time-decay of the\nR\ntotal \"mass\" M(t) = IRN u(x, t) dx of the solution (cf. Proposition 3.6).\nEquation (1.1) will be supplemented with the nonnegative initial datum,\nu(x, 0) = u0 (x),\n\n(1.3)\n\nand our standing assumptions are that u0 \u2208 W 1,\u221e (IRN ), and u0 \u2212 K \u2208 L1 (IRN ), for\nsome constant K \u2208 IR; as usual, W , with some superscripts, stands for various Sobolev\nspaces.\nThe long-time behavior of solutions to the viscous Hamilton-Jacobi equation ut =\n\u2206u + \u03bb|\u2207u|q , with \u03bb \u2208 IR, and q > 0, has been studied by many authors, see e.g.\n[1, 2, 3, 4, 12, 20], and the references therein. The dynamics of solutions to this equation\nis governed by two competing effects, one resulting from the diffusive term \u2206u, and the\nother corresponding to the \"hyperbolic\" nonlinearity |\u2207u|q . The above-cited papers\naimed at explaining how the interplay of these two effects influences the large-time\nbehavior of solutions depending on the values of q and the initial data. The present\npaper follows that strategy as well. Hence, we want to understand the interaction\nof the diffusive nonlocal L\u00e9vy operator (1.2) with the power-type nonlinearity. Our\nresults can be viewed as extensions of some of the above-quoted work. However, their\nphysical context is quite different and, to prove them, new mathematical tools have to\nbe developed.\nFor the sake of completeness we mention other recent works on nonlinear and nonlocal evolution equations. First, note that equation (1.1) also often appears in the\ncontext of optimal control of jump diffusion processes. Here, the theory of the viscosity solutions provides a good framework to study these equations. We refer the reader\nto the works of Jakobsen and Karlsen [15, 16], and Droniou and Imbert [13, 11] for\nmore detailed information and references. Fractional conservation laws, including the\nfractional Burgers equation, were studied in [5, 17, 18, 22] via probabilistic techniques\nsuch as nonlinear McKean processes and interacting diffusing particle systems.\nIn the next section, we specify our assumptions on the L\u00e9vy diffusion operator and\nstate the main results concerning the nonlinear problem (1.1)-(1.3). Section 3 contains\nproofs of those results which are independent of the sign of the intensity parameter\n\u03bb: the existence of solutions, the maximum principle, and the decay of k\u2207u(t)kp for\ncertain p > 1. Further properties of solutions to (1.1)-(1.3) in the deposition case \u03bb > 0\n\n\f4\n\nG. Karch & W.A. Woyczy\u0144ski\n\nare studied in Section 4. Properties specific for the evaporation case \u03bb < 0 appear in\nSection 5. Finally, the self-similar asymptotics of solutions is derived in Section 6.\nStandard notation is used throughout the paper. For 1 \u2264 p \u2264 \u221e, the Lp -norm of a\nLebesgue measurable, real-valued function v defined on IRN is denoted by kvkp . The set\nCb (\u03a9) consists of continuous and bounded functions on \u03a9, and Cbk (\u03a9) contains functions\nwith k bounded derivatives. The space of rapidly decaying, real-valued functions is\nR\ndenoted by S(IRN ). The Fourier transform of v is vb(\u03be) \u2261 (2\u03c0)\u2212N/2 IRN e\u2212ix\u03be v(x) dx.\nThe constants independent of solutions and of t (but, perhaps, dependent on the initial\nvalues) will be denoted by the same letter C, even if they may vary from line to line.\nOccasionally, we write, e.g., C = C(\u03b1, l) when we want to emphasize the dependence\nof C on parameters \u03b1, and l.\n\n2\n\nMain results and comments\n\nWe begin by gathering basic properties of solutions of the linear Cauchy problem\nut = \u2212Lu,\n\nu(x, 0) = u0 (x),\n\n(2.1)\n\nwhere the symbol a = a(\u03be) of the pseudodifferential operator L has the the L\u00e9vy\u2013\nKhintchine representation (cf. [14, Chapter 3])\na(\u03be) = Q\u03be * \u03be +\n\nZ\n\nIRn\n\n(1 \u2212 e\u2212i\u03b7\u03be \u2212 i\u03b7 * \u03be1I{|\u03b7|<1} (\u03b7)) \u03a0(d\u03b7).\n\n(2.2)\n\nc\nFor every v \u2208 S(IRN ), one can use formula (2.2) to invert the Fourier transform Lv(\u03be)\n=\na(\u03be)vb(\u03be) and to get representation (1.2). In view of (1.2), one can show (cf. [14, Thm.\n4.5.13]) that Lv is well defined for every v \u2208 Cb2 (IRN ).\nIt is well-known that the operator \u2212L generates a positivity-preserving, symmetric\nL\u00e9vy semigroup e\u2212tL of linear operators on L1 (IRn ) of the form\n\n(e\u2212tL v)(x) =\n\nZ\n\nIRN\n\nv(x \u2212 y)\u03bct (dy),\n\n(2.3)\n\nwhere the family {\u03bct }t\u22650 of probability Borel measures on IRN (called the convolution\nct (\u03be) = (2\u03c0)\u2212N/2 e\u2212ta(\u03be) . For every 1 < p < \u221e, the semisemigroup in [14]) satisfies \u03bc\ngroup e\u2212tL is analytic on Lp (IRn ), cf. [14, Thm. 4.2.12]. Moreover, the representation\n(2.3), and the properties of the measures \u03bct , imply that if 0 \u2264 v \u2264 1, almost everywhere, then 0 \u2264 e\u2212tL v \u2264 1, almost everywhere (i.e., e\u2212tL is a sub-Markovian semigroup\non Lp (IRN )).\nThe basic assumption throughout the paper is that the L\u00e9vy operator L is a \"perturbation\" of the fractional Laplacian (\u2212\u2206)\u03b1/2 , or, more precisely, that it satisfies the\nfollowing condition:\n\n\f5\n\nFractional Hamilton-Jacobi-KPZ equations\n\u2022 The symbol a of the operator L can be written in the form\na(\u03be) = l|\u03be|\u03b1 + k(\u03be),\n\n(2.4)\n\nwhere l > 0, \u03b1 \u2208 (0, 2]. and the pseudodifferential operator K, corresponding to\nthe symbol k, generates a strongly continuous semigroup of operators on Lp (IRN ),\n1 \u2264 p \u2264 \u221e, with norms uniformly bounded in t.\nObserve that, without loss of generality (rescaling the spatial variable x), we can\nassume that the scaling constant l in (2.4) is equal to 1. Also, note that the above\nassumptions on the operator K are satisfied if the Fourier transform of the function\ne\u2212tk(\u03be) is in L1 (IRN ), for every t > 0, and its L1 -norm is uniformly bounded in t.\nThe study of the large time behavior of solutions to the nonlinear problem (1.1)(1.3), will necessitate the following supplementary asymptotic condition on L:\n\u2022 The symbol k = k(\u03be) appearing in (2.4) satisfies the condition\nk(\u03be)\n= 0.\n\u03be\u21920 |\u03be|\u03b1\n\n(2.5)\n\nlim\n\nThe assumptions (2.4) and (2.5) are fulfilled, e.g., by multifractional diffusion operators\nL = \u2212a0 \u2206 +\n\nk\nX\n\naj (\u2212\u2206)\u03b1j /2 ,\n\nj=1\n\nwith a0 \u2265 0, aj > 0, 1 < \u03b1j < 2, and \u03b1 = min1\u2264j\u2264k \u03b1j , but, more generally, one can\nconsider here\nL = (\u2212\u2206)\u03b1/2 + K,\nwhere K is a generator of another L\u00e9vy semigroup. Nonlinear conservation laws with\nsuch nonlocal operators were studied in [6, 7, 8].\nIn view of the assumption (2.4) imposed on its symbol a(\u03be), the semigroup e\u2212tL\nsatisfies the following decay estimates (cf.

Karch & W.A. Woyczy\u0144ski\n\nLet us also note that under the assumption (2.5), the large time behavior of e\u2212tL is\ndescribed by the fundamental solution of the linear equation ut + (\u2212\u2206)\u03b1/2 u = 0. This\nresults is recalled below in Lemma 6.1.\nWe are now in a position to present our results concerning the nonlinear problem\n(1.1)-(1.3), starting with the fundamental problems of the existence, the uniqueness,\nand the regularity of solutions. Note that at this stage no restrictions are imposed\non the sign of the parameter \u03bb and the initial datum u0 . Consequently, all results of\nTheorem 2.1 are valid for both the deposition, and the evaporation cases.\nTheorem 2.1 Assume that the symbol a = a(\u03be) of the L\u00e9vy operator L satisfies condition (2.4) with an \u03b1 \u2208 (1, 2]. Then, for every u0 \u2208 W 1,\u221e (IRN ), and \u03bb \u2208 IR, there\nexists T = T (u0 , \u03bb) such that problem (1.1)-(1.3) has a unique solution u in the space\nX = C([0, T ), W 1,\u221e(IRN ).\nIf, additionally, there exists a constant K \u2208 IR such that u0 \u2212 K \u2208 L1 (IRN ), then\nu \u2212 K \u2208 C([0, T ], L1 (IRN ))\n\nand\n\nsup t1/\u03b1 k\u2207u(t)k1 < \u221e.\n\n(2.10)\n\n0<t\u2264T\n\nMoreover, for all t \u2208 (0, T ],\nku(t)k\u221e \u2264 ku0 k\u221e\n\nand k\u2207u(t)k\u221e \u2264 k\u2207u0 k\u221e .\n\n(2.11)\n\nand the following comparison principle is valid: for any two initial data satisfying\ncondition u0 (x) \u2264 \u01690 (x), the corresponding solutions satisfy the bound u(x, t) \u2264 \u0169(x, t),\nfor all x \u2208 IRN , and t \u2208 (0, T ].\nThe proof of Theorem 2.1, which is contained in Section 3, follows the standard\nalgorithm. First, using the integral (mild) equation\nu(t) = e\u2212tL u0 + \u03bb\n\nZ\n\n0\n\nt\n\ne\u2212(t\u2212\u03c4 )L |\u2207u(\u03c4 )|q d\u03c4,\n\n(2.12)\n\nand the Banach fixed point argument, we construct a local-in-time solution. In the\nnext step, we prove a \"maximum principle\" which confirms the \"parabolic nature\" of\nequation (1.1) and allows us to prove inequalities (2.11).\nRemark 2.1. Note that if u is a solution to (1.1) then so is u \u2212 K, for any constant\nK \u2208 IR. Hence, without loss of generality, in what follows we will assume that K = 0.\n\u2737\nRemark 2.2. After this paper was completed we received a preprint of [11] which\nstudied a nonlinear-nonlocal viscous Hamilton-Jacobi equation of the form\nut + (\u2212\u2206)\u03b1/2 u + F (t, x, u, \u2207u) = 0.\n\n\fFractional Hamilton-Jacobi-KPZ equations\n\n7\n\nUnder very general assumptions on the nonlinearity, and for \u03b1 \u2208 (1, 2), the authors\nof [11] construct a unique, regular, global-in-time (viscosity) solution for initial data\nfrom W 1,\u221e (IRN ). Moreover, that solution also satisfies a maximum principle which\nprovides inequalities (2.11), and the comparison principle analogous to that contained\nin Theorem 2.1. However, our proof of the maximum principle (cf. Theorem 3.4,\nbelow) is simpler than the proof of the corresponding result in [11], and is valid for\nmore general L\u00e9vy operators. On the other hand, we require the additional assumption\nu0 \u2212 K \u2208 L1 (IRN ), for some constant K \u2208 IR.\n\u2737\nOnce the solution u is constructed, it is natural to ask questions about its behavior\nas t \u2192 \u221e. From now onwards, equation (1.1) will be supplemented with the nonnegative integrable initial datum (1.3). In view of Theorem 2.1, the standing assumption\nu0 \u2208 W 1,\u221e (IRN ) \u2229 L1 (IRN ) allows as to define the \"mass\" of the solution to (1.1)-(1.3)\nby the formula\nZ\nM(t) = ku(t)k1 =\nu(x, t) dx, t \u2265 0.\n(2.13)\nIRN\n\nIt's large-time behavior is one of the principal objects of study in this paper. It turns\nout that in the deposition case, i.e., for \u03bb > 0, the function M(t) is increasing in t (cf.,\nProposition 3.6, below) and, for sufficiently small q, escapes to +\u221e, as t \u2192 \u221e. More\nprecisely, we have the following result which is an immediate consequence of the lower\nbounds for M(t) obtained below in Theorem 4.1.\n+\u03b1\n, and suppose that the symbol a of the L\u00e9vy opTheorem 2.2 Let \u03bb > 0, 1 < q \u2264 N\nN +1\nerator L satisfies conditions (2.4) and (2.5) with \u03b1 \u2208 (1, 2].

If, either ku0 k1 or k\u2207u0k\u221e is\nsufficiently small, then limt\u2192\u221e M(t) = M\u221e < \u221e.\n\nRemark 2.3. If we limit ourselves to L = (\u2212\u2206)\u03b1/2 in Theorem 2.3, it suffices only\n(q(N +1)\u2212\u03b1\u2212N )/(\u03b1\u22121)\nto assume that the quantity ku0 k1 k\u2207u0 k\u221e\nis small which is in perfect\nagreement with the assumption imposed in [20] for \u03b1 = 2. To see this fact, note\nthat the equation ut = \u2212(\u2212\u2206)\u03b1/2 u + \u03bb|\u2207u|q is invariant under rescaling uR (x, t) =\nRb u(Rx, R\u03b1 t) with b = (\u03b1 \u2212 q)/(q \u2212 1), for every R > 0. Choosing R = k\u2207u0 k\u22121/(1+b)\n\u221e\n1+b\nwe immediately obtain k\u2207u0,R k\u221e = R k\u2207u0 k\u221e = 1. Hence, the conclusion follows\nfrom the smallness assumption imposed on ku0,R k1 in Theorem 2.3 and from the identity\n(q(N +1)\u2212\u03b1\u2212N )/(\u03b1\u22121)\nku0,R k1 = ku0 k1 Rb\u2212n = ku0 k1 k\u2207u0 k\u221e\n.\n\u2737\n\n\f8\n\nG.

Then, each nonnegative solution to (1.1)-(1.3) with an\nR\ninitial datum u0 \u2208 W 1,\u221e (IRN )\u2229L1 (IRN ) has the mass M(t) = IRN u(x, t) dx increasing\nto a finite limit M\u221e , as t \u2192 \u221e..\nRemark 2.4. The smallness assumption imposed in Theorem 2.3 seems to be necessary.\nIndeed, for L = \u2212\u2206, it is known that if \u03bb > 0, and (N + 2)/(N + 1) < q < 2, then there\nexists a solution to (1.1)-(1.3) such that limt\u2192\u221e M(t) = +\u221e (cf. [4] and [2, Thm. 2.4]).\nMoreover, if ku0 k1 and k\u2207u0 k\u221e are \"large\", then the large-time behavior of solutions\nu is dominated by the nonlinear term ([2]), and one can expect that M\u221e = \u221e. We\nconjecture that analogous results hold true at least for the \u03b1-stable operator (fractional\nLaplacian) L = (\u2212\u2206)\u03b1/2 , and for q satisfying the inequality (N + \u03b1)/(N + 1) < q < \u03b1.\nWe also conjecture that the critical exponent q = 2 for L = \u2212\u2206 should be replaced by\nq = \u03b1 if L has a nontrivial \u03b1-stable part. In this case, for q \u2265 \u03b1, we also conjecture\nthat, as t \u2192 \u221e, the mass of any nonnegative solution converges to a finite limit, just\nlike in Theorem 2.4. Our expectation is that the proof of this conjecture can based on\na reasoning similar to that contained in the proof of Theorem 2.4. However, at this\ntime, we were unable to obtain those estimates in a more general case.\n\u2737\nIn the evaporation case, \u03bb < 0, the mass M(t) is a decreasing function of t (cf.,\nProposition 3.6, below), and the question, answered in the next two theorems, is when\nit decays to 0 and when it decays to a positive constant .\n+\u03b1\n, and suppose that the symbol a of the\nTheorem 2.5 Let \u03bb < 0, 1 \u2264 q \u2264 N\nN +1\nL\u00e9vy operator L satisfies conditions (2.4) and (2.5).

This fact is well known in the theory of generators of Feller semigroups (cf.\neg. [14, Ch. 4.5]) but we recall its simple proof for the sake of completeness of the\nexposition. Since\nu(x0 ) \u2212 (e\u2212tL v)(x0 )\n,\n(Lv)(x0 ) = lim\nt\u05810\nt\nthe proof will be completed by showing that v(x0 ) \u2264 (e\u2212tL v)(x0 ), for all t > 0.

Under the additional assumption, v \u2208 D(L) \u2229 C 2 (IRN ), it is possible\nto deduce Lemma 3.3 immediately from the representation of the operator L given\nin (1.2).

For every t \u2265 0, define f : [0, T ] \u2192 IR by the formula\nf (t) = infN u(x, t).\nx\u2208IR\n\nThis is a well-defined, and continuous function because u is uniformly continuous and\nbounded, for every t \u2265 0 by (3.3). Note also that, in view of (3.5), f (0) = 0, and\nf (t) \u2264 0, for every t \u2265 0. Our goal is to show that f \u2261 0.\nSuppose, to the contrary, that f (t) < 0 on an interval (t0 , t1 ), and f (t0 ) = 0. Hence,\nby (3.5), for every t \u2208 (t0 , t1 ), there exists an \u03be(t) \u2208 IRN such that f (t) = u(\u03be(t), t).\nNow, we show that f (t) = u(\u03be(t), t) is differentiable almost everywhere on the\ninterval (t0 , t1 ), and we follow the idea presented in [9]. Let us fix s, t \u2208 (t0 , t1 ). If\nf (t) \u2264 f (s), we obtain\n0 \u2264 f (s) \u2212 f (t) = infN u(x, s) \u2212 u(\u03be(t), t) \u2264 u(\u03be(t), s) \u2212 u(\u03be(t), t).\nx\u2208IR\n\n\f13\n\nFractional Hamilton-Jacobi-KPZ equations\nHence, the mean-value theorem and the assumption (3.3) yield\n|f (t) \u2212 f (s)| \u2264 |t \u2212 s| max kut (\u03c4 )k\u221e .\n\u03c4 \u2208[t0 ,t1 ]\n\nThis means that f is locally Lipschitz on (t0 , t1 ) and, therefore, by the Rademacher\ntheorem, differentiable almost everywhere . Moreover, f \u2032 is bounded on every closed\ninterval contained in (t0 , t1 ).\nIn the next step, we show that the equality\ndf (t)\n= ut (\u03be(t), t)\ndt\n\n(3.6)\n\nis satisfied for all those points from (t0 , t1 ) where f is differentiable. For t, t+h \u2208 (t0 , t1 ),\nwith h > 0, it follows from the definition of f that\nf (t + h) = u(\u03be(t + h), t + h) \u2264 u(\u03be(t), t + h);\nhence\n\nf (t + h) \u2212 f (t)\nu(\u03be(t), t + h) \u2212 u(\u03be(t), t)\n\u2264\n.\nh\nh\n\n(3.7)\n\nOn the other hand,\nf (t \u2212 h) = u(\u03be(t \u2212 h), t \u2212 h) \u2264 u(\u03be(t), t \u2212 h),\nand thus, for small h > 0,\nu(\u03be(t), t) \u2212 u(\u03be(t), t \u2212 h)\nf (t) \u2212 f (t \u2212 h)\n\u2265\n.\nh\nh\n\n(3.8)\n\nNow, we may pass to the limit, as h \u0581 0 in (3.7) and (3.8), to obtain the identity (3.6)\nin all points of differentiability of f .\nTo complete the proof note that under the assumption on f there is a t2 \u2208 (t0 , t1 )\nsuch that\nf \u2032 (t2 ) < 0.\n(3.9)\nR\n\nIndeed, this follows from the fact that 0 > f (t) = tt0 f \u2032 (s) ds, for all t \u2208 (t0 , t1 ).\nHowever, by equality (3.6) and Lemma 3.3, we have\ndf\n(t2 ) = \u2212(Lu)(\u03be(t2), t2 ) \u2212 a(\u03be(t2 ), t2 ) * \u2207u(\u03be(t2), t2 )\ndt\n= \u2212(Lu)(\u03be(t2), t2 ) \u2265 0,\nwhich contradicts (3.9). Hence, f \u2261 0 and the proof of Theorem 3.4 is complete.\n\n\u2737\n\nThe maximum principle from Theorem 3.4 can now be applied to our nonlinear\nproblem (1.1)-(1.3).\n\n\f14\n\nG. Karch & W.A. Woyczy\u0144ski\n\nProposition 3.5 The solution u = u(x, t) constructed in Theorem 2.1 satisfies inequalities (2.11), as well as the comparison principle.\nProof. First, we will show the comparison principle for solutions to (1.1)-(1.3) or, more\nprecisely, we will prove that if u0 (x) \u2264 \u01690 (x), for all x \u2208 IRN , then u(x, t) \u2264 \u0169(x, t), for\nall (x, t) \u2208 IRN \u00d7 [0, T ].\nDefine w = \u0169 \u2212 u which satisfies equation (3.2) with\nA = \u2212\u03bb\n\n|\u2207\u0169|q \u2212 |\u2207u|q\n(\u2207\u0169 \u2212 \u2207u),\n|\u2207\u0169 \u2212 \u2207u|2\n\nand with w(x, 0) = \u01690 (x) \u2212 u0 (x) \u2265 0. To apply Theorem 3.4, we only need to check\nthat w satisfies the regularity conditions imposed in (3.3) - (3.5).\nObviously, w \u2208 C([0, T ], W 1,\u221e(IRN )) \u2282 Cb (IRN \u00d7 [0, T ]). In order to improve on\nthis statement and show that, actually, w \u2208 Cb1 (IRN \u00d7[a, T ]), for every a > 0, it suffices\nto use the standard bootstrap argument involving the integral equation (2.12). Here,\nwe skip this reasoning and refer the reader either to [11, Thm. 3.1] or to [10, Sec. 5], for\nmore detailed calculations. Next, by Theorem 2.1, w = \u0169 \u2212 K \u2212 u + K \u2208 W 1,\u221e (IRN ) \u2229\nL1 (IRN ) for every t \u2208 [0, T ]; hence, w satisfies (3.5) because W 1,\u221e (IRN ) \u2229 L1 (IRN ) \u2282\nC0 (IRN ).\nNow, the first inequality in (2.11) follows immediately from the comparison principle\nproven above because constants are solutions to equation (1.1).\nTo prove the second inequality in (2.11), we observe that the functions vi = uxi ,\ni = 1, ..., N, satisfy the equations\nvi,t = \u2212Lvi + \u03bbq|\u2207u|q\u22122\u2207u * \u2207vi .\nApplying Theorem 3.4 and the reasoning from the first part of this proof we obtain\nkvi (t)k\u221e \u2264 kvi (0)k\u221e ,\nwhich completes the proof of Proposition 3.5.\n\n\u2737\n\nProof of Theorem 2.1. The local-in-time existence of solutions is shown in Propositions 3.1 and 3.2. Proposition 3.5 provides inequalities (2.11) and the comparison\nprinciple.\n\u2737\nGiven 0 \u2264 u0 \u2208 W 1,\u221e (IRN ) \u2229 L1 (IRN ), Proposition 3.2 allows us to define the\n\"mass\" of the solution to (1.1)-(1.3) by the formula\nM(t) = ku(t)k1 =\n\nZ\n\nIRN\n\nu(x, t) dx,\n\nt \u2265 0.\n\nThe next results shows the fundamental monotonicity property of this quantity.\n\n\f15\n\nFractional Hamilton-Jacobi-KPZ equations\n\nProposition 3.6 Assume that u \u2208 C([0, \u221e), L1(IRN )) is a solution of problem (1.1)(1.3) (or, more precisely, a solution to the integral equation (2.12)).

First, however, we need some\nauxiliary lemmata.\nLemma 3.7 Let g : (0, \u221e) \u2192 (0, \u221e) be a continuous function satisfying the inequality\ng(t) \u2264 A + Bg p (t), for all t > 0, some constants A, B > 0, and a p > 1. If Ap\u22121 B <\np\u22121 (1 \u2212 1/p)p\u22121, and lim supt\u21920 g(t) is sufficiently small, then g(t) \u2264 Ap/(p \u2212 1).\nProof. A direct calculation shows that the function f (x) = x \u2212 A \u2212 Bxp attains\nits maximum (for x > 0) at x0 = (pB)\u22121/(p\u22121) . Moreover, f (0) = \u2212A < 0, and\nf (x0 ) = (pB)\u22121/(p\u22121) (1 \u2212 1/p)p\u22121 > 0, for Ap\u22121 B < p\u22121 (1 \u2212 1/p)p\u22121 . Hence, g(t)\nremains in the bounded component (containing zero) of the set {x \u2265 0 : f (x) < 0}.\nObviously, g(t) \u2264 x0 , however, one can improve this inequality as follows:\ng(t) \u2264 A + Bg(t)g p\u22121(t) \u2264 A + Bg(t)xp\u22121\n\u2264 A + g(t)/p.\n0\nThis completes the proof of Lemma 3.7.\n\n\u2737\n\nLemma 3.8 For every p \u2208 [1, \u221e], there exists a constant C depending only on p, and\nsuch that, for every v \u2208 Lp (IRN ) \u2229 L1 (IRN ),\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n1/\u03b2 \u03b2\n\nD(v, p) \u2261 sup t1/\u03b1 (1 + t)\u03b2 k\u2207e\u2212tL vkp \u2264 C kvk1/\u03b2\n+ kvk1\np\nt>0\n\nwhere \u03b2 =\n\nN\n\u03b1\n\n\u0010\n\n1\u2212\n\n1\np\n\n\u0011\n\n.\n\n,\n\n(3.11)\n\n\f16\n\nG.

Our reasoning is based on the integral equation (2.12), estimates of the semigroup e\u2212tL stated in (2.6)-(2.9), and several algebraic calculations on fractions. First,\nnote that (N + \u03b1)/(N + 1) < N/(N + 1 \u2212 \u03b1), for \u03b1 > 1; hence the inequalities in (3.12)\nmake sense.\nIn view of equation (2.12) and inequalities (2.6)-(2.7) we obtain\nk\u2207u(t)kp0 \u2264 k\u2207e\u2212tL u0kp0\n0\n+Ck\u2207u0 kq\u2212p\n\u221e\n\nZ\n\n(3.14)\nt\n0\n\n(t \u2212 \u03c4 )\u2212N (1\u22121/p0 )/\u03b1\u22121/\u03b1 k\u2207u(\u03c4 )kpp00 d\u03c4.\n\nNext, we define the auxiliary function\ng(t) = sup \u03c4 1/\u03b1 (1 + \u03c4 )N (1\u22121/p0 )/\u03b1 k\u2207u(\u03c4 )kp0 ,\n0\u2264\u03c4 \u2264t\n\nwhich, by (3.14), satisfies\np0\n0\nt1/\u03b1 (1 + t)N (1\u22121/p0 )/\u03b1 k\u2207u(t)kp0 \u2264 D(u0 , p0 ) + Ck\u2207u0 kq\u2212p\n\u221e g(t) h(t)\n\n(3.15)\n\nfor all t > 0, and a constant C independent of t and u0 .

First, note that, for every t > 0, the integral\nin the definition of h(t) converges because the inequality \u2212N(1 \u2212 1/p0 )/\u03b1 \u2212 1/\u03b1 > \u22121\n\n\f17\n\nFractional Hamilton-Jacobi-KPZ equations\n\nis equivalent to the condition p0 < N/(N + 1 \u2212 \u03b1); moreover, \u2212p0 /\u03b1 > \u22121 since, for\n\u03b1 \u2208 (1, 2], we have p0 < N/(N + 1 \u2212 \u03b1) \u2264 \u03b1.\nFor large values of t the integral is bounded by t\u03b2 , with \u03b2 = \u2212N(1\u22121/p0 )/\u03b1\u22121/\u03b1\u2212\np0 /\u03b1\u2212N(p0 \u22121)/\u03b1+1; hence h(t) \u2264 Ct1\u2212p0 /\u03b1\u2212N (p0 \u22121)/\u03b1 , where, for p0 > (N +\u03b1)/(N +1),\nthe exponent is negative .\nNext, we analyse the behavior of h(t), as t \u2192 0. In this case, say for t \u2208 (0, 1),\nwe obtain h(t) \u2264 ct\u2212N (1\u22121/p0 )/\u03b1\u2212p0 /\u03b1+1 .

This, however, follows from the continuity of the function \u03b2(p0)\nbecause, for \u03b1 > 1, we have \u03b2((N + \u03b1)/(N + 1)) = N(\u03b1 \u2212 1)2 /(\u03b1(N + \u03b1)(N \u2212 1)) > 0.\nHence, by (3.15), the function g(t) satisfies the inequality\np0\n0\ng(t) \u2264 D(u0 , p0 ) + Ck\u2207u0 kq\u2212p\n\u221e g(t) ,\n\nand the proof is completed by Lemma 3.7, because lim supt\u21920 g(t) \u2264 D(u0 , p0 ), which\nfollows from (3.15), and from the properties of the function h(t) shown above.\n\u2737\n\n4\n\nMass evolution in the deposition case\n\nIn the deposition case, i.e., for \u03bb > 0, Proposition 3.6 asserts that the mass function\nR\nM(t) = IRN u(x, t); dx is increasing in t.

(4.6) and (4.7))\nZ tZ\n0\n\nIRN\n\n1\n|\u2207u|2 dxd\u03c4 \u2264 ku0 k22 .\n2\n\nHence, repeating the reasoning from the proof of Theorem 2.6, we obtain, for sufficiently\nsmall \u03b5 > 0, that\n\u03b5\nM\u221e\n\u2265\u03b5\n\nZ\n\nIRN\n\nq\u22122\nu0 (x) dx \u2212 \u03b5q (|\u03bb|/2)k\u2207u0k\u221e\nku0 k22 > 0.\n\nNote that, in this case, we do not need decay estimates from Theorem 3.9.\n\n6\n\n\u2737\n\nSelf-similar asymptotics\n\nAssumptions (2.4) and (2.5) allow us to approximate e\u2212tL u0 by a multiplicity of the\nkernel\nZ\n1\n\u03b1\neix\u03be e\u2212t|\u03be| d\u03be.\np\u03b1 (x, t) =\n\u2212N/2\nN\n(2\u03c0)\nIR\nIndeed, we have the following\nLemma 6.1 If the symbol a(\u03be) of the L\u00e9vy operator L satisfies conditions (2.4), and\n(2.5), then, for each p \u2208 [1, \u221e], and u0 \u2208 L1 (IRn ),\nlim tN (1\u22121/p)/\u03b1 e\u2212tL u0 \u2212\n\nt\u2192\u221e\n\nZ\n\nIRN\n\nu0 (x) dx p\u03b1 (t)\n\n= 0.\n\n(6.1)\n\np\n\nProof. This result is obtained immediately from the inequality\nh \u2217 g(*) \u2212\n\n\u0012Z\n\nIRn\n\n\u0013\n\nh(x) dx g(*)\np\n\n\u2264 Ck\u2207gkpkhkL1 (IRn ,|x| dx) ,\n\n(6.2)\n\nwhich is valid for each p \u2208 [1, \u221e], all h \u2208 L1 (IRn , |x| dx), and every g \u2208 C 1 (IRn ) \u2229\nW 1,1 (IRn ), with a constant C = Cp independent of g, and h. The inequality itself is a\nsimple consequence of the Taylor expansion.\n\n\f24\n\nG. Karch & W.A. Woyczy\u0144ski\n\nTo prove the Lemma we apply (6.2), with h = e\u2212tK u0 , and g(x) = p\u03b1 (x, t), assuming\nfirst that u0 \u2208 L1 (IRn , |x| dx). The general case of u0 \u2208 L1 (IRn ) can then be handled\nby an approximation argument. Details of such a reasoning can be found in [8, Cor.\n2.1 and 2.2].\n\u2737\nNow, we are in a position to prove the final, main theorem of Section 2.\nProof of Theorem 2.7. Since M\u221e is finite, formula (3.10) for M(t) implies that\nk\u2207ukqq \u2208 L1 (0, \u221e). It follows from the integral equation (2.12) that\nku(t) \u2212 e\u2212(t\u2212t0 )L u(t0 )k1 \u2264\n\nZ\n\nt\n\nt0\n\nk\u2207u(\u03c4 )kqq d\u03c4,\n\nfor all t \u2265 t0 \u2265 0.\n\nHence,\nku(t) \u2212 M\u221e p\u03b1 (t)k1 \u2264\n\nZ\n\nt\n\nt0\n\nk\u2207u(\u03c4 )kqq d\u03c4\n\n+ke\u2212(t\u2212t0 )L u(t0 ) \u2212 M(t0 )p\u03b1 (t)k1\n+kp\u03b1 (t)k1 M(t0 ) \u2212 M\u221e .\n\nLetting t \u2192 \u221e, and using Lemma 6.1 for the second term on the right-hand side, we\nobtain\nZ \u221e\nk\u2207u(\u03c4 )kqq d\u03c4 + |M(t0 ) \u2212 M\u221e |,\nlim sup ku(t) \u2212 M\u221e p\u03b1 (t)k1 \u2264\nt\u2192\u221e\n\nt0\n\nbecause kp\u03b1 (t)k1 = 1. Since t0 can be arbitrarily large, and each term on the right-hand\nside tends to 0, as t0 \u2192 \u221e, the proof of (2.15) is complete.\nNow, we apply the H\u00f6lder inequality to obtain\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\nku(t) \u2212 M\u221e p\u03b1 (t)kr \u2264 ku(t) \u2212 M\u221e p\u03b1 (t)k11\u2212\u03b3 ku(t)k\u03b3p + M\u221e kp\u03b1 (t)k\u03b3p ,\nwith \u03b3 = (1 \u2212 1/r)/(1 \u2212 1/p). Finally, to prove (2.17), it suffices to apply inequality\n(2.16), the asymptotic result (2.15), and the identity kp\u03b1 (t)kp = t\u2212N (1\u22121/p)/\u03b1 kp\u03b1 (1)kp .\n\u2737\nAcknowledgements.
