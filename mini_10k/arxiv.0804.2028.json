As exemplified by the study\nof D\u2013branes in presence of a finite constant B\u2013field [1, 2], it seems that geometry can\nbe noncommutatively deformed whenever stringy effects are relevant. In particular cases\nlike that of strings in a constant graviphoton background, the deformation produced lies\nin the Grassmann sector of superspace whose undeformed coordinates are characterised by\nanticommutators, giving raise to what has been called non(anti)commutative field theories\n[3].\nEnormous\n\neffort\n\nhas\n\nbeen\n\nmade\n\nunderstanding\n\nboth\n\nnoncommutative\n\nand\n\nnon(anti)commutative field theories and their relation to string theory [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11].\nMost studies introduce a Moyal product to deform the (super)field algebra of known theories, as this is precisely the kind of geometry that results from string constant backgrounds.\nThe resulting theories usually break Lorentz symmetry and, in the non(anti)commutative\ncase, also either supersymmetry or chirality.\n\nThe Moyal product construction is very\n\nsatisfactory when dealing with deformations of Euclidean (super)spaces, but breaks down in\ncurved geometry where it should be replaced by a more general object like the Kontsevich\nproduct.\n\nAs an example, the deformed geometry of D\u2013brane worldvolumes in curved\n\nbackgrounds is given to third order in the deformation parameter precisely by such product\n[12], which unfortunately can only be constructed order by order in a series expansion.\nOn the other hand, ordinary Moyal product-noncommutative field theories suffer from bad\ncausal behaviour when time is treated as a noncommuting coordinate.\nMore recently, in view of the limitations inherent to such methods, an alternative noncommutative deformation of gauge theories based on the notion of the Weyl bundle has\nbeen proposed [9, 13]. In these works, authors use the powerful machinery developed by\nFedosov [14, 15] which consists in a Weyl deformation of a symplectic tangent space, where\nthe symplectic structure plays the role of the deformation parameter. The advantage of\nusing this method is twofold: it allows the description of physical situations where the background field is not constant, and in addition spacetime global symmetries remain unbroken\nby the deformation itself since it affects the tangent and not the base space. This approach\nto deformation quantization has been used extensively to study string theory D-branes in\n2\n\n\fnon-constant B-fields and more general curved backgrounds [13], supermembrane models\n[9], the fuzzy sphere [16], the canonical formulation of noncommuative gauge theories [17],\nand BRST symmetry in quantum field theories [18].\nOne may naturally ask if its possible to generalize Fedosov's ideas to describe more\ngeneral physical setups like non(anti)commutative field theories associated to non-constant\ngraviphoton backgrounds. At first sight one could consider an atlas where the problem\nmay be stated in terms of constant fields on each open set, as the Darboux theorem is\nonly valid in the neighbourhood of a point and not globally, but we must then consider\nhighly nontrivial matching conditions on the overlapping of the sets. It is therfore more\nconvenient to directly develop a non(anti)commutative product for general fields extending\nthe known one for constant fields. Also, from a quantum field theoretical point of view,\nconstructing a mechanism that deforms superspace but preserves super Poincar\u00e9 symmetry\n(or its Euclidean counterpart) is relevant in its own right. Our work has precisely this goal.\nThe deformation quantization of certain Poisson brackets in the context of Batchelor\nsupermanifolds using Fedosov's approach was first done by M. Bordemann, [19, 20]. In\nthe present paper we are mostly interested in field theories involving fermionic fields, as we\nexplicitly discuss in section V. Although the Batchelor approach is an interesting one from\na mathematical and physical point of view it does not allow the introduction of fermionic\nfields, it is for this reason that the Batchelor definition of supermanifolds is not followed in\nsupersymmetric field theory.\nIn this paper we extend Fedosov's deformation quantization to N = 1 superspace. We\ntake a symplectic supermanifold and ordinary superspace as the tangent and base space\nrespectively, and propose a new associative Weyl product which is non(anti)commutative,\nmeaning it is noncommutative for even objects that naturally fulfil commutation relations,\nand nonanticommutative for odd objects naturally satisfying anticommutation relations.\nSuch product endows the space of superfields with a superalgebra structure. A key feature\nof our formulation is the preservation of super Poincar\u00e9 symmetry, a fact derived from a deformation operator acting exclusively on tangent superspace variables. The super Poincar\u00e9\nalgebra acting on base superspace is therefore totally transparent to such deformation. We\nprove that in certain cases, the projection of the Weyl (super)product on the base supermanifold, results in the nonanticommutative product associated to nilpotent Q\u2013 and\nD\u2013deformations such as those studied in [4, 6, 7, 8]. And further explore more general situ3\n\n\fations where the nonanticommuting parameter is actually a function of the base supermanifold variables. This last subject is not even formulated in the literature as a supersymmetric\nextension using Kontsevich methods. [21].\n\nII.\n\nWEYL ALGEBRA BUNDLE\n\nIn this section we review Weyl algebra bundle theory basics [15]. We start with a symplectic manifold (M, \u03c9) of dimension 2n, where the two-form \u03c9 defines a symplectic structure\non each tangent space Tx (M), x \u2208 M.\nThe formal Weyl algebra Wx is an associative algebra of formal series over\n\nC which stems\n\nfrom the symplectic space Tx (M). Its elements are defined by\nX\n\na(y, ~) =\n\n~k ak,\u03b1 y \u03b1,\n\n(1)\n\nk,|\u03b1|\u22650\n\nwith ~ being the formal parameter, y \u2208 Tx (M) with coordinates (y 1 , . . . , y 2n ), and \u03b1 =\n\u03b11 , . . . , \u03b12n a multi-index such that y \u03b1 = (y 1 )\u03b11 * * * (y 2n )\u03b12n . It is possible to introduce an\nordering prescription for the terms if we define the degree of the variables to be deg y i =\n1, deg ~ = 2. The terms in the series can then be arranged by increasing degrees 2k + |\u03b1|.\nA more friendly notation is\na(y, ~) =\n\nX\n\n~k ak,\u03bc1 ...\u03bcp y \u03bc1 . . . y \u03bcp ,\n\n(2)\n\nk,p\u22650\n\nwhere it is understood that p = 0 terms correspond to the sum\n\nP\n\nk\n\n~k ak .\n\nThe product of elements in this algebra is given by the Weyl product rule\n\u0013\n\u0012\ni~ ij \u2202 \u2202\na(y, ~)b(z, ~)\na \u25e6 b = exp \u2212 \u03c9\n2\n\u2202y i \u2202z j\nz=y\n\u0013k\n\u221e \u0012\nk\nX\n1 i1 j 1\n\u2202k b\n\u2202 a\ni~\n\u03c9 . . . \u03c9 ik j k i1\n,\n=\n\u2212\n2\nk!\n\u2202y . . . \u2202y ik \u2202z j1 . . . \u2202z jk\n\n(3)\n\nk=0\n\nwhich is associative and independent of the particular choice of basis on the tangent space\nTx (M). The algebras Wx constitute the fibers of the Weyl bundle W of formal Weyl algebras,\nwhich is defined through the union of all fibers\nW =\n\n[\n\nx\u2208M\n\n4\n\nWx .\n\n(4)\n\n\fDifferential q-forms on M with values in W are sections of the bundle W \u2297 \u03a9q defined by\nit formal series\na(x, y, ~) =\n\nX\n\n~k ak,i1 ...1p ,j1 ...jq (x)y i1 . . . y ip dxj1 \u2227 . . . \u2227 dxjq ,\n\n(5)\n\nk,p\u22650\n\nwhere the coefficients ak,i1 ...1p ,j1 ...jq (x) are covariant tensors fields symmetric in i1 . . . ip and\nantisymmetric in j1 . . . jq depending on a point in M. They constitute an algebra C \u221e (W \u2297\n\u03a9\u2217 ) under the usual Weyl product and the exterior product of forms, with unit identically\nequal to 1. The total degree deg a = 2k+p corresponding to the variables ~ and y i establishes\na filtration within this algebra W \u2297 \u03a9\u2217 \u2283 W1 \u2297 \u03a9\u2217 \u2283 W2 \u2297 \u03a9\u2217 \u2283 * * * . For q = 0 we have\nsections simply as formal series\na(x, y, ~) =\n\nX\n\n~k ak,\u03b1 (x)y \u03b1 ,\n\n(6)\n\nk,|\u03b1|\u22650\n\nwith ak,\u03b1(x) covariant symmetric tensor fields on M. The bracket of two forms a \u2208 W \u2297 \u03a9q1\nand b \u2208 W \u2297 \u03a9q2 takes the form\n[a , b] = a \u25e6 b \u2212 (\u22121)q1 q2 b \u25e6 a.\n\n(7)\n\nA form a will be called central if for any b \u2208 C \u221e (W \u2297 \u03a9\u2217 ) the commutator (7) vanishes.\nThe center of C \u221e (W \u2297 \u03a9\u2217 ) consists exclusively of forms not containing y, which suggests\na projection into the center by setting y to zero. For a \u2208 C \u221e (W ) we will denote such\nprojection by\n\u03c3(a) = a(x, 0, ~).\n\n(8)\n\nIt is customary to define operators that rise and lower the rank of differential forms:\n\u03b4 :\n\nC \u221e (Wp \u2297 \u03a9q ) \u2192 (Wp\u22121 \u2297 \u03a9q+1 ) and \u03b4 \u2217 :\n\nC \u221e (Wp \u2297 \u03a9q ) \u2192 (Wp+1 \u2297 \u03a9q\u22121 ), and\n\nrespectively lower and rise the degree of each term in the formal series. These fulfil the\nfollowing properties\n\u2022 \u03b4 2 = (\u03b4 \u2217 )2 = 0,\n\u2022 \u03b4(a \u25e6 b) = \u03b4(a) \u25e6 b + (\u22121)q a \u25e6 \u03b4(b), for a \u2208 \u03a9q\n\u2022 a = \u03b4\u03b4 \u22121 a + \u03b4 \u22121 \u03b4a + a00 ,\n\n5\n\n\fwhere apq denotes the homogeneous part of Weyl degree p and cohomological degree q of\na \u2208 W \u2297 \u03a9q . Note that the last relation is similar to the Hodge-Rahm decomposition, yet \u03b4\nis a pure algebraic operator on M as we can see from its realization in local coordinates\n\u03b4a = dxk \u2227\n\ni\n\u2202\na = \u2212 [\u03c9ij y i dxj , a].\nk\n\u2202y\n~\n\n(9)\n\nTo define a connection on the Weyl bundle one recalls there exists a symplectic connection\non any symplectic manifold that is torsion free and preserves the symplectic structure\n\u2202k \u03c9ij \u2212 \u03c9nl \u0393nmk \u2212 \u03c9kn \u0393nml = 0.\n\n(10)\n\nUsing Darboux coordinates one can check that the connection symbols \u0393ijk are completely\nsymmetric \u0393[ijk] = 0. The symplectic connection can be used to define a connection on the\nbundle W \u2297 \u03a9\u2217 by its action on elements of C \u221e (W \u2297 \u03a9\u2217 )\n\u2207a = dxi \u2227 \u2207i a ,\n\n(11)\n\ni\n\u2207a = da + [\u0398, a],\n~\n\n(12)\n\nin Darboux coordinates it reduces to\n\nwhere the connection symbols are \u0398 = 12 \u0398ijk y i y j dxk .

Following closely\nthe known construction of Weyl bundle, we will need a symplectic structure \u03c9 defined on a\nsupermanifold M. In the following section we give the first steps toward such extension of\ndeformation quantization, by defining this concepts and introducing a new Weyl product of\nsuperfields.\n\nA.\n\nSymplectic supermanifolds\n\nThe structure underlying the concept of supermanifold [30] is that of\n\nRp|q\n\nspace, i.e.\n\nRp endowed with a sheaf C \u221e[\u03b81, \u03b82, . . . , \u03b8q ] of super R\u2013algebras freely\ngenerated over C \u221e (Rp ) by the Grassmann (Z2 \u2013graded) algebra basis {\u03b81 , \u03b82 , . . . , \u03b8q }. We\nthe topological space\n\nwill represent the set of superspace coordinates by\nz A = (xm , \u03b8\u03b1\u0302 ),\n\nm = 1, . . . p,\n\n\u03b1\u0302 = 1, . . . , q,\n\n(24)\n\nwhere capital indices consist of the total set of superspace indices, which comprise lowercase\nm, n, . . . for standard spacetime directions, and \u03b1\u0302, \u03b2\u0302, . . . for doted and undoted Grassmannodd indices. The anticommuting (odd) variables \u03b8\u03b1\u0302 obey\n{\u03b8\u03b1\u0302 , \u03b8\u03b2\u0302 } = 0,\n\n\u03b1\u0302, \u03b2\u0302 = 1, . . . , q.\n\n(25)\n\nRp, a supermanifold M of dimension\np|q consists of a topological space M together with a sheaf of R\u2013algebras called the structure\nsheaf OM , such that M is locally isomorphic to Rp|q .\nLike usual manifolds, that are locally isomorphic to\n\nThe differential geometry involving supermanifolds is quite similar to the classical one,\nhaving similar definitions and properties for super vector bundles, connections and actions\nof super Lie groups. The most significant difference arises from the existence of differential\nforms with arbitrary high degree, which hinders a straightforward generalization of integration. Nevertheless, after introducing the Berezinian, integration over supermanifolds can be\neasily defined.\n8\n\n\fA super vector bundle of rank p|q over M is a sheaf of locally free OM \u2013supermodules V\nof dimension p|q. It can be also defined as a fibre bundle over M with typical fiber\n\nRp|q ,\n\nhaving as structure group the super general linear group GL(p|q). The first example of super\nvector bundle is the tangent bundle of a supermanifold, which can be constructed from the\nderivations of the superalgebra OM satisfying\nD(f g) = (Df )g + (\u22121)p(D)p(f ) f (Dg),\nwhere p defines the\n\n\u2200f, g \u2208 OM .\n\nZ2\u2013grading of objects (0 for even, 1 for odd).\n\n(26)\n\nThe O\u2013supermodule of\n\nderivations of OM is a vector bundle of dimension p|q called the tangent bundle T (M),\nwhose local basis consist of even \u2202/\u2202xm and odd \u2202/\u2202\u03b8\u03b1\u0302 derivations. Sections of the tangent\nbundle are called vector fields and are locally written as\nY = Y A eA = y m\n\n\u2202\n\u2202\n+ \u03b7 \u03b1\u0302 \u03b1\u0302 .\nm\n\u2202x\n\u2202\u03b8\n\n(27)\n\nThe set of vector fields Vect(M) is a super Lie algebra.\nThe cotangent bundle \u03a91M of M is the dual of T (M), whose basis we denote by dz A =\n(dxm , d\u03b8\u00e2 ). One can interpret the duality pairing as an inner product h*, *i : T (M)\u2297\u03a91M \u2212\u2192\nOM , satisfying\nhf Y, g\u03c9i = (\u22121)p(Y )p(g) f ghY, \u03c9i,\n\n\u2200f, g \u2208 OM .\n\nIn the local basis, such product can be obtained by linearity from\n\u001c\n\u001d\n\u2202\nB\n= \u03b4AB .\n, dz\nA\n\u2202z\n\n(28)\n\n(29)\n\nThe wedge product of 1-forms is defined through\ndz A \u2227 dz B = \u2212(\u22121)p(A)p(B) dz B \u2227 dz A\n\n(30)\n\nwhere p(A) indicates the parity of an object with index A. One can linearly extend this defk+l\ninition to the exterior product \u2227 : \u03a9kM \u00d7 \u03a9lM \u2212\u2192 \u03a9M\nof k-forms with l-forms, providing the\n\nset of all forms with the structure of a superalgebra which is called the exterior superalgebra\n\u03a9\u2217M \u2261 \u2227\u2217 \u03a91M . Note that in contrast with the wedge product of forms, supercoordinates and\nsuperfield components conform supercommutative superalgebras like\nz A z B = (\u22121)p(A)p(B) z B z A ,\n\n9\n\n(31)\n\n\fas the concepts of cohomological degree of a form, and that of Grassmann parity are independent.\nThe derivative d : OM \u2212\u2192 \u03a91M defined by\nhY, df i = Y (f ),\n\n(32)\n\nextends uniquely to the exterior derivative d = dz A \u2202/\u2202z A on the exterior superalgebra and\nsatisfies\nd2 = 0,\n\nd(\u03c9\u03c7) = d\u03c9 \u2227 \u03c7 + (\u22121)p \u03c9 \u2227 d\u03c7,\n\n\u03c9 \u2208 \u03a9pM .\n\n(33)\n\nFrom here onwards we will take p = 2n even and q = 4N representing the physically\nrelevant set of odd variables, thus studying only the supermanifold\n\nR2n|4N . In 4|4 dimensions,\n\nfor example we have A = (m, \u03b1, \u03b1\u0307)., i.e. z A = (xm , \u03b8\u03b1 , \u03b8\u0304\u03b1\u0307 ), with \u03b1 = 1, 2, \u03b1\u0307 = 1\u0307, 2\u0307. The\nnotation we use is consistent with that of Wess and Bagger [25] for differential forms in\nsuperspace.\nA symplectic supermanifold is a 2n|4N dimensional supermanifold M endowed with a\nclosed, non-degenerated two-form \u03c9 called the symplectic superform. In coordinates,\n\u03c9 = \u03c9AB dz A \u2227 dz B .\n\n(34)\n\nThe Darboux theorem [27, 28, 29] states that there exist local coordinates on the supermanifold where the symplectic superform \u03c9 has the following block shape\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n\u03c9mn 0\n\uf8f8,\n\u03c9AB = \uf8ed\n0 \u03c9\u03b1\u0302\u03b2\u0302\n\n(35)\n\nwith Grassmann-even components having definite symmetry under index exchange \u03c9mn =\n\u2212\u03c9nm and \u03c9\u03b1\u0302\u03b2\u0302 = \u03c9\u03b2\u0302 \u03b1\u0302 . The symplectic superform can be used to rise and lower indices.\nSymplectic supermanifolds always admit a torsionless affine connection preserving the symplectic superform, called (super)symplectic connection. We will denote the connection by \u2207,\nand define its coefficients \u0393A\nBC by its action on the tangent base\n\u2207eA eB = \u2207A eB = \u0393C\nAB eC .\n\n(36)\n\nSuch coefficients can be found from the Leibnitz property of the covariant derivative\n\u2207Y1 (\u03c9(Y2 , Y3)) = (\u2207Y1 \u03c9)(Y2, Y3 ) + \u03c9(\u2207Y1 Y2 , Y3 ) + \u03c9(Y2, \u2207Y1 Y3 )\n10\n\n(37)\n\n\fThe conditions for the vanishing of the torsion in superspace can be derived from its very\ndefinition in terms of vector fields Y1 and Y2\nT = \u2207Y1 Y2 \u2212 \u2207Y2 Y1 \u2212 [Y1 , Y2],\n\n(38)\n\nresulting in the following components\nT Amn = \u0393Amn \u2212 \u0393Anm\nT Am\u03b1\u0302 = \u0393Am\u03b1\u0302 \u2212 \u0393A\u03b1\u0302m\n\n(39)\n\nT A\u03b1\u0302\u03b2\u0302 = \u0393A\u03b1\u0302\u03b2\u0302 + \u0393A\u03b2\u0302 \u03b1\u0302\nA torsion free affine connection associated to our symplectic superform is defined by the\nequation\n\u2207X \u03c9(Y1, Y2 ) = \u2207X [\u03c9(Y1, Y2 )] \u2212 \u03c9(\u2207X Y1 , Y2 ) \u2212 \u03c9(Y1, \u2207X Y2 ) = 0\n\n(40)\n\nIn Darboux coordinates, the resulting conditions on the connection coefficients (36) are\n\u03c9kl \u0393kmn + \u03c9nk \u0393kml = 0\n\u03c9\u03b1\u0302\u03b2\u0302 \u0393\u03b2\u0302mn \u2212 \u03c9nk \u0393k m\u03b1\u0302 = 0\n\n(41)\n\n\u03c9\u03b1\u0302\u03b2\u0302 \u0393\u03b2\u0302\u03b4\u0302\u03b3\u0302 + \u03c9\u03b3\u0302 \u03b2\u0302 \u0393\u03b2\u0302\u03b4\u0302\u03b1\u0302 = 0\n\u03c9mn \u0393n\u03b1\u0302\u03b2\u0302 \u2212 \u03c9\u03b2\u0302 \u03b4\u0302 \u0393\u03b4\u0302 \u03b1\u0302m = 0\nFollowing (39), the torsionless components of the symplectic connection are\n\nB.\n\n\u0393lnm = \u0393nlm\n\na completely symmetric object\n\n\u0393l\u03b1\u0302n = \u0393n\u03b1\u0302l\n\na completely symmetric object\n\n\u0393l\u03b1\u0302\u03b2\u0302 = \u0393\u03b2\u0302 \u03b1\u0302l\n\nantisymmetric in 1,2 positions but symmetric in 2,3\n\n\u0393\u03b3\u0302 \u03b1\u0302\u03b2\u0302 = \u2212\u0393\u03b2\u0302\u03b3\u0302 \u03b1\u0302\n\na completely antisymmetric object\n\nWeyl superalgebra bundle through a new associative superproduct\n\nWe will consider a symplectic supermanifold (M, \u03c9) locally isomorphic to\n\nR4|4 represent-\n\ning N = 1 symplectic superspace, as most results are easily generalized to extended superspace. Local coordinates of z \u2208 M, and the components of a generic vector Y \u2208 Tz (M)\nin tangent space, are to be denoted z A = (xm , \u03b8\u03b1 , \u03b8\u0304\u03b1\u0307 , ) and Y A = (y m , \u03b7 \u03b1, \u03b7\u0304 \u03b1\u0307 ) respectively,\n11\n\n\fwhere \u03b8\u03b1\u0302 , \u03b7 \u03b1\u0302 are Grassmann-odd.

Similar structures that\nappeared in the context of anti-Poisson brackets on Grassmann algebras [26] were developed\nfurther into a Fedosov-type procedure on the dual Grassmann algebra bundle of a given\nvector bundle [19, 20]. Note that the product (48) differs from such anti-Moyal products as\nit acts on the tangent superspace T (M), thus protecting super Poincar\u00e9 symmetry on M\nfrom breaking. In Darboux coordinates [27, 28] the Poisson structure \u03c9 M N becomes block\ndiagonal allowing a separation of the sum inside the exponential into a purely bosonic and\na purely fermionic part.

If we include the standard \u25e6 product in\nDarboux coordinates one also concludes that this product is associative in general, from the\ncovariant character of \u229a.\nThe Weyl superalgebra is easily extended to include q-superforms on M, that is, sections\non W \u2297 \u03a9\u2217 expressed as\nf (z, Y, ~) =\n\nX\n\n~k fk,A1 ,...,Ap ,B1 ...,Bq (z)Y A1 * * * Y Ap dz B1 \u2227 . . . \u2227 dz Bq .\n\nk,p\n\n14\n\n(57)\n\n\fThese differential forms constitute an algebra with multiplication defined by the combined\nexterior superproduct of forms given in \u00a7III A together with the Weyl product acting on\ntangent superspace variables.\nThe commutator of 2 superforms f \u2208 W \u2297 \u03a9q1 and g \u2208 W \u2297 \u03a9q2 is\n[f, g] = f \u229a g \u2212 (\u22121)q1 q2 (\u22121)p(f )p(g) g \u229a f.\n\n(58)\n\nA central superform f is such that for any g \u2208 W \u2297 \u03a9\u2217 , [f, g] = 0. In (58) the wedge exterior\nproduct \u2227 acting on forms is understood.\n\nIV.\nA.\n\nSUPERSPACE DEFORMATIONS\nAbelian subalgebra and deformations\n\nIn the purely bosonic case the Weyl product is linked to deformations on the base space\nthrough a correspondence between C \u221e (M) and the Abelian subalgebra that, in Darboux\ncoordinates, results in the well known Moyal product, as was proved in [15]. In this section\nwe will show that this is also the case for the Weyl superproduct, which for the chiral case\ngive us precisely the nonanticonmutative product extensively studied in this decade, see for\nexample [3, 6, 7].\nWe start with the concept of Abelian connection. A connection DA on the Bundle W is\ncalled Abelian if for any section f \u2208 W \u2297 \u03a9\u2217\nDA2 f = 0\n\n(59)\n\nInspired by Fedosov construction, we will lift the supersymplectic connection defined in\n\u00a7III A to the Weyl superalgebra bundle\nD = dz A \u2227 \u2207A f.\n\n(60)\n\nD is a covariant derivative acting on C \u221e (W \u2297 \u03a9\u2217 ) and obeying the following properties\nD(f \u229a g) = Df \u229a g + (\u22121)q1 +p(f ) f \u229a Dg\nD [f , g] = [Df, g] + (\u22121)q1 +p(f ) [f, Dg]\nAnother important operators involved in the construction of the Abelian connection are\n\u03b4 : Wp \u2297 \u03a9q \u2192 Wp\u22121 \u2297 \u03a9q+1 that raises the rank of forms and acts as a sort of exterior\n15\n\n\fsuperderivative, and \u03b4 \u2217 : Wp \u2297 \u03a9q \u2192 Wp+1 \u2297 \u03a9q\u22121 , that lowers the rank of forms and acts\nas a contraction operator. In coordinate basis they are realized as\n\u03b4f = dz A \u2227\n\n\u2202\nf\n\u2202Y A\n\n\u03b4 \u2217 f = iY A \u2227\n\n\u2202\nf,\n\u2202z A\n\n(61)\n\nUsing (31), (30) and\ndz A \u2227 Y B = (\u22121)p(Y )p(dz) ,\n\n(62)\n\nand observing their action on each term in the formal series\nfk,A1,...,Ap ,B1 ,...,Bq Y A1 * * * Y Ap dz B1 \u2227 * * * \u2227 dz Bq ,\n\n(63)\n\none can check their properties\n\u03b4 2 = 0,\n\n(\u03b4 \u2217 )2 = 0,\n\n(64)\n\n\u03b4(f \u229a g) = \u03b4f \u229a g + (\u22121)p(f )+q f \u229a \u03b4g,\n\n(65)\n\nf = \u03b4\u03b4 \u22121 f + \u03b4 \u22121 \u03b4f + f00 .\n\n(66)\n\nHere fpq is the coefficient with p times Y and q times dz, so that (p + q)\u03b4 \u22121 fpq = \u03b4 \u2217 fpq .\nGiven the supersymplectic connection D, there always exists an Abelian connection\nDA * = D * +\n\n\u0003\ni \u0002\n(\u03c9AB Y A Y B + r), *\n~\n\n(67)\n\nwhere r \u2208 C \u221e (W3 \u2297 \u03a91 ) satisfies \u03b4 \u22121 r = 0.\nThe proof follows the corresponding one in Fedosov [15, \u00a75.2], where mainly the properties\nof \u03b4, \u03b4 \u22121 and degree counting are used. The arguments are exactly the same. The curvature\nof the Abelian connection is\ni\n1\nF = \u2212 \u03c9AB dz A \u2227 dz B + R \u2212 \u03b4r + Dr + r 2\n2\n~\n\n(68)\n\nWe consider then r satisfying\ni\n\u03b4r = R + Dr + r 2 ,\n~\n\n(69)\n\nwhich ensures that DA is Abelian. Eq (69) has a unique solution belonging to C \u221e (W3 \u2297 \u03a91 )\nand satisfying \u03b4 \u22121 r = 0. The main point in Fedosov's proof, which can be extended to the\nsupersymplectic case, is to show that\nr=\u03b4\n\n\u22121\n\n\u0012\n\ni\nR + Dr + r 2\n~\n16\n\n\u0013\n\n(70)\n\n\fhas a unique solution belonging to C \u221e (W3 \u2297 \u03a91 ). This follows from the iteration procedure\ndefined by\n\u0012\n\u0013\ni 2\nDrn + rn ,\nrn+1 = \u03b4 R + \u03b4\nn = 0, 1, 2, . . .\n(71)\n~\nFrom degree counting one obtains deg(rn \u2212 rn+1 ) \u2265 n + 3 implying that the terms for any\n\u22121\n\n\u22121\n\nfixed degree of the sequence are the same for large enough n. There exists then a unique\nsolution in C \u221e (W3 \u2297 \u03a91 ). It is then straightforward to show that this solution satisfies (69)\nas \u03b4 \u22121 r = 0 holds by construction. Uniqueness arises from acting on (69) with \u03b4 \u22121 and using\nthe above property of r.\nWith this at hand we propose an Abelian connection of the simplest form\nDA f = Df \u2212 \u03b4f\n\n(72)\n\nOnce we have the Abelian connection, we use it to find the elements of the Abelian\nsub(super)algebra WA = {f \u2208 W : DA f = 0}. There is a one-to-one correspondence between the set of solutions to the equation DA f = 0 and functions on the base space M, that\nrelates the Weyl product to a deformation on the base space. A proof of this correspondence\nis a straightforward generalization of the original theorem by Fedosov (5.2.4 in [15]).\nLet us consider a section a \u2208 C \u221e (W), a = a(x, \u03b8, y, \u03b7), and focus in the Abelian subalgebra DA a = 0. As in Fedosov [15] we take\n\u03b4a = (DA + \u03b4)a,\n\n(73)\n\nbeing a a 0\u2013form for which \u03b4 \u22121 a = 0 holds, the Hodge-De Rham decomposition results in\na = a|y=\u03b7=0 + \u03b4 \u22121 (DA + \u03b4)a.\n\n(74)\n\nGiven a|y=\u03b7=0 = a(x, \u03b8, 0, 0), as \u03b4 \u22121 raises degree, an iteration procedure yields existence\nand uniqueness of the solution. The bijection then follows from (74).\nConsidering bosonic coordinates only, it is known that the deformation induced in base\nspace by a Weyl product in Darboux coordinates is precisely the Moyal product [9, 15].\nMore succinctly, let \u03c3 : WA \u2212\u2192 C \u221e (M)[[~]] be the projection to the center that maps\n\u03c3 : f 7\u2192 f00 and \u03c3 : g 7\u2192 g00 , then\n\u03c3(f \u25e6 g) = f00 \u22c6 g00 ,\n\n(75)\n\nwhere \u22c6 stands for the Moyal product. In the next section we will obtain the nonanticommutative \u22c6 product, proposed in [4, 6, 7] as a projection of the \u229a superproduct to the base\nspace using Darboux chiral coordinates in superspace.\n17\n\n\fV.\n\nNONANTICOMMUTATIVE Q\u2013DEFORMATIONS FROM WEYL SUPER-\n\nPRODUCT\n\nIn this section we will restrict ourselves to functions f \u2208 C \u221e (W \u2297 \u03a90 ) whose coefficients\nare chiral superfields, i.e. D\u0304 \u03b1\u0307 f = 0, where D\u0304 \u03b1\u0307 stands for the supersymmetric derivative in\nthe base space. In order to obtain nonanticommutativity in the base space, we will drop \u03c9 mn\nand \u03c9 \u03b1\u0307\u03b2\u0307 terms.
