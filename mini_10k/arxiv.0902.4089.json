Baer characterized capable finite abelian groups (a\ngroup is capable if it is isomorphic to the quotient of some group\nby its center) by a condition on the size of the factors in the invariant factor decomposition (the group must be noncyclic and\nthe top two invariant factors must be equal). We provide a different characterization, given in terms of a condition on the lattice\nof subgroups. Namely, a finite abelian group G is capable if and\nonly if there exists a family {Hi } of subgroups of G with trivial\nintersection, such that the union generates G and all the quotients\nG/Hi have the same exponent. The condition that the family of\nsubgroups generates G may be replaced by the condition that the\nfamily covers G and the condition that the quotients have the same\nexponent may be replaced by the condition that the quotients are\nisomorphic.\n\nA class of finite groups with a certain property played a crucial role in\nthe construction of a large family of finitely generated torsion groups\nof intermediate growth [B\u016001] that generalize the examples of Grigorchuk [Gri84]. Namely, Bartholdi and the author used finite groups\nB that satisfy the following condition. There exists a family of normal\nsubgroups {Ni }i\u2208I of B such that\nT\n(i) Si\u2208I Ni = 1,\n(ii) i\u2208I Ni = B,\n(iii) B/Ni \u223c\n= B/Nj , for i, j \u2208 I.\nIn his dissertation [\u0160un00] the author conjectured that the class of finite abelian groups that have this property is precisely the class of\nnoncyclic abelian groups for which the top two factors in the invariant factor decomposition are equal. We prove this conjecture here.\nBy an earlier result of Baer [Bae38], it follows that this class of finite\nabelian groups is precisely the class of capable finite abelian groups.\nThis gives a complete description of the finite abelian groups B that\nsatisfy the condition on the lattice of subgroups given above. The case\nof nonabelian groups seems much harder and not much is known at the\n2000 Mathematics Subject Classification. 20K01, 20D30.\nThe work presented here is partially supported by NSF/DMS-0805932.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nZORAN \u0160UNI\u0106\n\nmoment. Note that, because of the intersection Q\ncondition, the group B\nembeds as a subdirect product in the product i\u2208I B/Ni . Therefore,\nB is nonabelian if and only if the quotients B/Ni are nonabelian. The\nsimplest example of a nonabelian group B with the above property of\nwhich the author is aware uses the symmetric group S3 for the quotients and has size 4 * 36 = 2916. It was communicated to Bartholdi\nand the author by D. Holt (see [B\u016001] for specifics on this nonabelian\nexample). A necessary condition on the structure of B is given by\nBrodie, Chamberlain, and Kappe [BCK88]. Namely, they show that a\ngroup can be covered by a family of proper normal subgroups if and\nonly if it has a noncyclic abelian quotient.\nNote that the condition on the lattice of subgroups given above implies the condition (c) in the following theorem and is implied by the\ncondition (d).\nTheorem 1. Let G \u223c\n= Cn1 \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 Cnk be a finite nontrivial abelian\ngroup, where Cni , i = 1, . . . , k, denotes the cyclic group of order ni and\n1 < n1 | n2 | * * * | nk .\nThe following conditions are equivalent.\n(a) There exists a group L such that G \u223c\n= L/Z(L), where Z(L)\ndenotes the center of L.\n(b) k \u2265 2 and nk\u22121 = nk .\n(c) ThereTexists a family of subgroups {Hi }i\u2208I of G such that\n(i) Si\u2208I Hi = 1,\n(ii) h i\u2208I Hi i = G,\n(iii) all groups in the family {G/Hi }i\u2208I have the same exponent.\n(d) ThereTexists a family of subgroups {Hi }i\u2208I of G such that\n(i) Si\u2208I Hi = 1,\n(ii) i\u2208I Hi = G,\n(iii) G/Hi \u223c\n= G/Hj , for i, j \u2208 I.\n\u223c\n(iv) Hi = Hj , for i, j \u2208 I.\nBefore we prove the main result, we provide a statement of a simple\nlemma that is certainly known. Nevertheless, for completeness, we\nprovide an elementary proof of the lemma after the proof of Theorem 1.\n\u223c B = hbi \u223c\nLemma 1. Let A = hai =\n= Cn , where n > 1, and let\nC = AB be the direct product of A and B (written internally). Let X\nbe the set of elements of C of order n.\n(a) ai bj \u2208 X if and only if the greatest common divisor of i, j, and\nn is 1.\n(b) For every x \u2208 X there exists y \u2208 X such that C = hxihyi as an\ninternal direct product.\n\n\fON CAPABILITY OF FINITE ABELIAN GROUPS\n\n(c) C =\n\nS\n\n3\n\nx\u2208X hxi.\n\nProof of Theorem 1. Let {Gi }ki=1 be a family of subgroups of G such\nthat, hai i = Gi \u223c\n= Cni , for i = 1, . . . , k and G = G1 G2 . . . Gk .\n(a) is equivalent to (b). This is proved by Baer [Bae38].\n(d) implies (c). Clear.\n(c) implies (b). Assume that the family {Hi }i\u2208I of subgroups of\nG satisfies the intersection condition (c)(i), the generating condition\n(c)(ii), and the quotient exponent condition (c)(iii).\nBy way of contradiction, assume that G is cyclic. Then all of its\nsubgroups and quotients are cyclic and, for every subgroup H of G, the\nexponent of G/H is equal to |G|/|H|. Since, for every divisor of |G|,\nthere exists a unique subgroup of that particular order, the quotient\nexponent condition implies that the family {Hi }i\u2208I consists of a single\ngroup, which, by itself, cannot satisfy both the intersection condition\nand the generating condition in a nontrivial group. Therefore G is not\ncyclic, i.e., k \u2265 2.\nBy way of contradiction, assume that nk /nk\u22121 = m > 1.\nLet p be a prime dividing m and Ap be the unique subgroup of Gk\nof order pt , where pt is the highest power of p dividing m.\nLet H be a subgroup of G. We claim that G/H has index dividing\nnk\n= nk\u22121 * m\nif and only if H contains Ap .\npt\npt\nAssume that H contains Ap . For any element g in G, the element\nt\ng nk\u22121 belongs to Gk . Therefore g nk /p is an element of Gk of order\nt\nt\ndividing pt , which means that g n/p belongs to Ap \u2264 H. Thus g nk /p = 1\nin G/H, showing that the exponent of G/H divides nk /pt .\nConversely, let the exponent of G/H divide nk /pt . Let pT be the\nhighest power of p dividing nk and let g be an element of Gk of order\nt\npT . The element g n/p must be equal to 1 in G/H, which means that\nt\nt\ng nk /p belongs to H. On the other hand, g nk /p is an element of Gk\nof order exactly pt , which means that it generates Ap . Therefore H\ncontains Ap .\nSince the exponent of G is nk , the generating condition for the family {Hi }i\u2208I implies that at least one group in this family must have\nexponent divisible by pT (since the exponent of the group generated\nby the family {Hi }i\u2208I is the least common multiple of the exponents of\nthe groups Hi , i \u2208 I). Let Hj be such a group. Since Hj is abelian, it\nT \u2212t\nmust contain an element h of order pT . The element hp\nis then an\nelement of Gk of order pt , which means that it generates Ap . Therefore\nHj contains Ap and the exponent of G/Hj divides nk /pt .\n\n\f4\n\nZORAN \u0160UNI\u0106\n\nBy the last remark and the quotient exponent condition, G/Hi divides n/pt , for all i \u2208 I, which implies that each member of the family\n{Hi }i\u2208I contains Ap , violating the intersection condition.\nTherefore, k \u2265 2 and nk = nk\u22121 .\nn /n\n\n(b) implies (d). Let Hi = ha1 , . . . , ai\u22121 , ai ak k i , ai+1 , . . . , ak\u22121 i, i =\n1, . . . , k \u2212 1, and Hk = ha1 , . . . , ak\u22121i.\nClearly Hk \u223c\n= G1 . . . Gk\u22121 . Further, for i = 1, . . . , k \u2212 1, the order of\nn /n\nn /n\nthe element ai ak k i is exactly ni . Since hai ak k i i\u2229ha1 , . . . , ai\u22121 , ai+1 , . . . , ak\u22121 i =\n1 we have that, for i = 1, . . . , k,\nHi \u223c\n= G1 G2 . . . Gk\u22121.\nClearly, G/Hk \u223c\n= Gk , for i = 1, . . . , k \u22121.\n= Gk . We claim that G/Hi \u223c\nnk /ni\nnk /ni\nn /n\n\u223c\nWe have G/Hi = Gi Gk /hai ak\ni. Since ai ak\n, ak \u2208 hai ak k i iGk we\nn /n\nn /n\nn /n\nconclude that Gi Gk = hai ak k i iGk . Therefore G/Hi \u223c\n= hai ak k i iGk /hai ak k i i.\nn /n\nn /n\nWe claim that Gk \u2229 hai ak k i i = 1. Indeed, if g = (ai ak k i )m \u2208 Gk ,\nthen ni (the order of ai ) must divide m, which implies that g =\nn /n\nmnk /ni\n= 1. Thus the intersection hai ak k i i \u2229 Gk is trivial and\nam\ni ak\nn /n\nn /n\nwe have hai ak k i iGk /hai ak k i i \u223c\n= Gk . Thus, for i = 1, . . . , k,\nG/Hi \u223c\n= Gk .\nmk\n1\nLet g = am\n1 . . . ak , 0 \u2264 mi < ni for i = 1, . . . , k, be an element in\nthe intersection \u2229ki=1 Hi . Since g \u2208 Hk = ha1 , . . . , ak\u22121 i, we must have\nn /n\nmk = 0. For i = 1, . . . , k\u22121, since g \u2208 Hi = ha1 , . . . , ai\u22121 , ai ak k i , ai+1 , . . . , ak\u22121 i\nand mk = 0, the exponent mi must be divisible by ni (the order of the\nn /n\nelement ak k i ), which then implies that mi = 0. Thus,\nk\n\\\ni\u22121\n\nHi = 1.\n\nS\nSince a1 , . . . , ak\u22121 \u2208 Hk and ak\u22121 ak \u2208 Hk\u22121 , we have h ki\u22121 Hi i = G.\nSo far, we constructed a family of subgroups H = {Hi }ki=1 of G that\nare all isomorphic to G1 . . . Gk\u22121 , with quotients isomorphic to Gk ,\nwith trivial intersection, and with union that generates G. However,\nwe need a family of groups that cover G. In order to accomplish this\nwe will enlarge the family H by more subgroups H of G such that\nH\u223c\n= Gk .\n= G1 . . . Gk\u22121 and G/H \u223c\nDenote nk\u22121 = nk = n, Gk\u22121 = A = hai and Gk = B = hbi. Let\nX be the set of elements of order n in AB. For x in X, let Hx =\nG1 . . . Gk\u22122hxi.

In what follows, given an element ai bj in C, let d\nbe the greatest common divisor of i and j and let i\u2032 and j \u2032 be integers\nsuch that ii\u2032 + jj \u2032 = d.\n(a) If (ai bj )m = 1, then mi \u2261 mj \u2261 0 (mod n), implying md \u2261\nm(ii\u2032 + jj \u2032 ) \u2261 0 (mod n). If d is relatively prime to n, then we must\nhave m \u2261 0 (mod n). In other words, if i, j, and n are relatively prime,\nthe order of ai bj is n. On the other hand, if i, j, and n have a common\n\u2032\ndivisor d\u2032 > 1 then (ai bj )n/d = 1, implying that the order of ai bj is\nsmaller than n.\n(b) Let x = ai bj \u2208 X. Since x \u2208 X, d is relatively prime to n.\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\nConsider the element y = aj b\u2212i . We have xi y j = aii bji ajj b\u2212ji = ad .\n\u2032\nSimilarly, xj y \u2212i = bd . Since d is relatively prime to n, ad and bd\ngenerate C, implying that x and y also generate C. Since the order\nof y cannot be larger than n, it must be equal to n and C is internal\ndirect product of hxi and hyi.\n(c) Let c = ai bj be a nontrivial element of C. Then c = ai bj =\ni\u2032\u2032 j \u2032\u2032 d\n(a b ) , where i\u2032\u2032 and j \u2032\u2032 are relatively prime.
