For example, fragile glassforming liquids undergo a dramatic slowing down of their relaxational dynamics when the temperature is dropped\nbelow the glass transition temperature1 . This effect is sharpened in certain mean-field models where, at a critical\ntemperature Td , a transition occurs from an equilibrium kind of dynamics to an off-equilibrium aging one2 . The\nphenomenon is ubiquitous and can be found also in very different fields: e.g. in local search algorithms for solving\nhard optimization problems the time-complexity may become extremely large by varying a macroscopic parameter3 .\nA better understanding of the mechanisms leading to the dramatic slowing down in out of equilibrium dynamics is a\nsubject of broad interest and wide applicability.\nIn describing the dynamical slowing down (and possible eventual arrest) the common view suggests that at a low\ntemperature a huge number of metastable states appears (with energies higher than the equilibrium one, E0 ), making\nrelaxation to equilibrium very slow, and even impossible if interactions are long ranged and metastable states lifetimes diverge in the thermodynamic limit. This picture has been verified by solving the out of equilibrium Langevin\ndynamics of a particularly simple mean-field model, the so-called fully connected spherical p-spin, whose Hamiltonian\nis4\nX\nH{\u03c3} = \u2212\n(1)\nJi1 ...ip \u03c3i1 . . . \u03c3ip ,\n1\u2264i1 <...<ip \u2264N\n\nP\nwhere the N spins \u03c3i are continuous variables subject to the spherical constraint i \u03c3i2 = N and the couplings are i.i.d.\nrandom variables with zero mean and variance p!/(2N p\u22121 ). In this model (hereafter p \u2265 3) if we consider a quench,\nthat is if we choose an initial configuration of high energy and let the system relax at a fixed value of the temperature\nT < Td (Td being the dynamic transition temperature), the asymptotic dynamics remains trapped at the energy level\nof the highest and most numerous metastable states, the so-called threshold states. Time-translation invariance and\nthe dynamic fluctuation-dissipation relation are violated and aging is observed in correlation and response functions5 .\nThese features are intriguing and experimentally relevant, since aging behaviour has been observed in many disordered systems. Nevertheless, in order to compare with more realistic situations it is extremely useful to understand\nthe dynamical behaviour during a cooling. In this case the system relaxes while the temperature is slowly decreased\nfrom an initial high value to a final temperature below Td .\nIn the single-p-spin model, defined by the Hamiltonian (1), changing the temperature during the dynamics has no\neffect on the asymptotic states approached by the relaxing system6 . This can be easily understood by considering\nthe structure of metastable states. Thanks to a particular symmetry, at any temperature T \u2264 Td the ordering (in\nfree-energy) of the metastable states is the same they have (in energy) at zero temperature7 . As a consequence\nthe metastable threshold states, those where the out of equilibrium dynamics converges to, are the same at any\ntemperature below Td . However, for this very reason, the single-p-spin model can be considered as pathological.\nIn more realistic systems, when the temperature (or any other external parameter) varies, metastable states may\nappear/disappear and their ordering is no longer preserved. For such systems, many questions on the dynamical\nbehaviour are still open: for example, it is not clear what is the asymptotic state of the off-equilibrium dynamics if\nthe temperature varies during the relaxation and whether such asymptotic state can be computed directly from the\nthermodynamical measure (i.e. statically), without solving the dynamical equations. In this paper we try to give some\nanswers to the above points.\nA last comment on the relevance of the present work concerns the difference between a cooling and a quench.\nThe common experience (exploited by the Simulated Annealing method) tells us that, in the same amount of finite\n\n\f2\ntime, the cooling is able to reach lower energies than the quench. But what happens in the large times limit? In\nthe single-p-spin model the answer is simple: any cooling scheme, included the quench, converges to threshold states,\nwhich are T -independent. On the contrary, if threshold states vary with temperature, the answer was unclear and we\nshow analytically that the asymptotic state may depend on the cooling scheme. The paper is organized as follows:\nSection I describes the model we want to study and summarizes what was already known about it; in Section II\nwe write and solve the equation for the out of equilibrium dynamics, starting from a thermalized configuration; in\nSection III we report the results of the computation of the number of tap states, constrained to a fixed distance\nfrom a reference state (more details are given in Appendix A) and we compare these results with the solution of the\ndynamical equations; finally in Section IV we summarize our results and give some future perspective.\nI.\n\nTHE MODEL\n\nWe focus our attention on a modified version of the p-spin Hamiltonian, the so-called multi-p-spin model, in which\nspins do interact in r-uples with r taking more than one value:\nX\nX\nH{\u03c3} = \u2212\ncr\n(2)\nJi1 ...ir \u03c3i1 . . . \u03c3ir ,\nr\n\n1\u2264i1 <...<ir \u2264N\n\nUsing the overline for the disorder average, we have that\nH{\u03c3}H{\u03c4} =\n\n1X 2 r\nc q \u2261 f (q) ,\n2 r r\n\n(3)\n\nP\nwhere q \u2261 i \u03c3i \u03c4i /N is the overlap among \u03c3 and \u03c4 . The single-p-spin corresponds to f (q) = q p /2.\nThe choice of the Hamiltonian (2) is motivated by the request of an exactly solvable dynamics, for which we need\ncontinuous variables interacting in a fully-connected fashion. Unlike the single-p-spin case, in the multi-p-spin model\nthere is level crossing of metastable states by varying the temperature8 .\nFrom a statical point of view, this model is characterized by the presence of a large number of metastable states\nN (f ) \u223c exp[N \u03a3(f )]. The so-called complexity \u03a3 is an increasing function of the free-energy f which is zero at the\nlower band edge f0 and maximal for a certain value f = fmax . For high temperatures the Gibbs measure is dominated\nby the paramagnetic state (mi = 0), while for T < Td (Td being the dynamical critical temperature), metastable states\nstart to play a relevant role, much in the same way as for the single-p-spin model. In this region the thermodynamic\nequilibrium is given by a class of metastable 'equilibrium' states with finite complexity (see e.g. Ref. 9), the global free\nenergy of the system thus bearing a contribution from this state-related entropy, i.e. \u2212T ln Z = F = feq \u2212 T \u03a3(feq ).\nLowering still more the temperature, the complexity of the equilibrium states decreases until a point where it becomes\nzero and the lower band edge states, non exponential in number, become dominant. The temperature where this\noccurs, Ts , is the static transition temperature for this model, as can be seen also by a direct computation of the\npartition function with the replica method. The interpretation of this transition as an 'entropy crisis' for metastable\nstates is particularly relevant when comparing this model with real systems: indeed fragile glasses do exhibit in this\nrespect a very similar phenomenology.\nThe structure of metastable states can be investigated in much detail by considering the tap approach, where meanfield equations can be formulated for the local magnetizations mi (at fixed disorder realization), and stable solutions\nof these equations identified as states of the system. Recently, some novel intriguing features of this formalism have\nemerged, according to which metastable states can either satisfy a supersymmetry between fermionic and bosonic\nintegration variables10 , either break it11 . Supersymmetric (SS) states are very robust to external perturbations, while\nsupersymmetry breaking ones (SSB) are extremely fragile, and even a small perturbation can dramatically change\ntheir number and global structure12 . Interestingly, the multi-p-spin model addressed in this paper, contrary to the\nsingle-p case, exhibits states of both classes13 and allows a comparative study of their role. In particular, states in the\nrange [f0 , fth ] are SS, while states with f \u2208 [fth , fmax ] are SSB. The free energy level fth separating the SS from the\nSSB region, that we shall call threshold energy, also plays a relevant role in the dynamical behaviour of this system.\nAnother important feature of metastable states, which is more relevant for the questions we want to address, is\ntheir behaviour with changing the temperature. For the single-p-spin spherical model, as anticipated above, states\ncan be transposed in temperature and their energy ordering does not change. There is no birth/death of states with\nvarying the temperature, or, in other words, a tap solution at zero temperature persists when the temperature is\nturned on until T = Td . In the multi-p-spin model this is not the case. To investigate more explicitly this point, we\nneed a method to 'pin' out a state and 'follow' it with varying the temperature. This can be done by resorting to a\ndynamical analysis.\n\n\f3\nII.\n\nTHE DYNAMICS\n\nGiven the Hamiltonian (2) with a generic correlator f (q), it is possible to write the equations for the Langevin\ndynamics at temperature T = 1/\u03b2 as\n\u2202H{\u03c3}\n\u2202\u03c3i (t)\n+ \u03b7(t) ,\n=\u2212\n\u2202t\n\u2202\u03c3i\n\n(4)\n\nwhere \u03b7(t) is a thermal Gaussian noise with zero mean and variance\nh\u03b7(t)\u03b7(t\u2032 )i =\n\n2\n\u03b4(t \u2212 t\u2032 ) .\n\u03b2\n\n(5)\n\nGiven the initial conditions this equation can be solved exactly using the method of the generating functional14 .\nSelf-consistent equations for the correlation function C(t, t\u2032 ) = h\u03c3i (t)\u03c3i (t\u2032 )i and the response function R(t, t\u2032 ) =\n\u2202\u03c3i (t)/\u2202hi (t\u2032 ) read\nZ t\u2032\n\u2202C(t, t\u2032 )\n= \u2212\u03bc(t)C(t, t\u2032 ) +\ndsf \u2032 [C(t, s)]R(t\u2032 , s) +\n\u2202t\n0\nZ t\ndsR(t, s) f \u2032\u2032 [C(t, s)]C(s, t\u2032 ) + \u03b2 \u2032 f \u2032 [C(t, 0)]C(t\u2032 , 0)\n+\n0\n\n\u2202R(t, t\u2032 )\n= \u2212\u03bc(t)R(t, t\u2032 ) +\n\u2202t\n\nZ\n\n(6)\n\nt\u2032\n\ndsf \u2032\u2032 [C(t, s)]R(t, s)R(s, t\u2032 )\n\n(7)\n\n0\n\nwhere \u03bc(t) is a Lagrange multiplier implementing the spherical constraint on the spins and obeys the dynamical\nequation\nZ t\nZ t\n1\n\u2032\n(8)\ndsR(t, s) f \u2032\u2032 [C(t, s)]C(s, t) + + \u03b2 \u2032 f \u2032 [C(t, 0)]C(t, 0)\ndsf [C(t, s)]R(t, s) +\n\u03bc(t) =\n\u03b2\n0\n0\nThe most studied case is the one where initial conditions are chosen at random (\u03b2 \u2032 = 0), and the system starts\nexploring the configuration space from a high energy configuration. In this context, for example, the first analytical\ncomplete treatment of aging behaviour has been carried out for the single-p-spin5 .\nFrom our point of view, however, the most interesting situation is another one. If we choose the initial condition\n\u03c3(t = 0) to belong to a given metastable state, then we can let the system evolve and check whether the state is stable\nand well-defined (in which case we expect an equilibrium-like relaxation dynamics inside the state) or looses stability\n(exhibiting off-equilibrium behaviour). To this aim15 , we may choose an initial condition thermalized at temperature\nT \u2032 = 1/\u03b2 \u2032 , i.e.\nP {\u03c3(0)} =\n\n1\nexp [\u2212\u03b2 \u2032 H{\u03c3(0)}]\nZ\n\n(9)\n\nIndeed, since for Ts < T \u2032 \u2264 Td the Boltzmann measure is dominated by a class of metastable states, the distribution\n(9) naturally picks out a configuration \u03c3(0) which belongs to one of such states. Besides, since the class of dominating\nstates varies with the temperature, we can use T \u2032 to select the kind of state (i.e. energy, complexity and self-overlap)\nwe want the system to start in.\nSummarizing, the dynamics that we are considering, described by Eqs. (4-9), involves two distinct temperatures.\nThe first one, T , controls the thermal noise and therefore represents the temperature at which the dynamical evolution\ntakes place. The second one, T \u2032 is used to force the system to start into a given metastable state, and to select its\nproperties. We now analyze the dynamical behaviour of the system by tuning these two parameters.\nA.\n\nThe quench\n\nThe case \u03b2 \u2032 = 0 corresponds to random initial conditions, that is to a quench. In this case the system undergoes\na dynamical transition at a critical temperature T = Td where the relaxation time diverges (much in the same way\nas in the single-p-spin). For T < Td the dynamics exhibits aging and asymptotically reaches the threshold states,\n\n\f4\nwhich have energy density Eth (corresponding to free energy density fth ) and self-overlap qth = qm , where qm (T ) is\nthe solution to the marginality condition\nf \u2032\u2032 (qm )(1 \u2212 qm )2 = T 2 .\n\n(10)\n\nA similar behaviour occurs for any T \u2032 > Td .\nWe note that the dynamics following a quench always converges to the edge of the SS region, despite a larger number\nof SSB states are present at higher energy densities (Eth < E < Emax ). At least two explanations are possible: (i)\nSSB states are \"invisible\" for the dynamics we have solved; (ii) SSB states are marginally unstable (they have a finite\nnumber of zero modes in the thermodynamic limit) and they are unable to trap the system during the relaxation11 .\nB.\n\nThe case Ts < T \u2032 \u2264 Td\n\nWhen Ts < T \u2032 \u2264 Td , the situation is more complex: as described above the thermodynamic equilibrium is no longer\ngiven by the paramagnetic state but rather by a set of metastable states with energy density E \u2208 [E0 , Eth ]. Thus,\nthe initial configuration belongs to one of such states. For T = T \u2032 the system undergoes an equilibrium dynamics in\nthe state where it was at the starting time. For T < T \u2032 the initial condition is out of equilibrium and, according to\nthe value of T , different dynamical behaviours can be observed. In particular, a critical temperature Tag (T \u2032 ) exists,\nsuch that:\ni) For Tag (T \u2032 ) < T < T \u2032 < Td the system follows, at large times, an equilibrium relaxation dynamics. Eqs. (6)\nand (7) can be easily solved exploiting time-translational invariance and the fluctuation-dissipation relation between\ncorrelation and response. The asymptotic regime is then fully described by the two parameters\nq1 =\n\nlim\n\nlim C(t, t\u2032 )\n\n(t\u2212t\u2032 )\u2192\u221e t\u2032 \u2192\u221e\n\nand p\u0303 = lim C(t, 0) ,\nt\u2192\u221e\n\n(11)\n\nwhich turn out to be different from zero15 , similarly to the single-p-spin model6 . The physical interpretation is clear:\nthe system has been prepared inside an equilibrium state at temperature T \u2032 ; at temperature T this state still exists,\neven if with slightly different features, and the system dynamically relaxes into it. In this view, q1 identifies the\nself-overlap of the state at temperature T , while p\u0303 measures the overlap between the equilibrium state at T \u2032 , where\nthe initial configuration is placed, and the same state transposed at temperature T .\nii) For T < Tag (T \u2032 ) < Td the dynamics remains out of equilibrium even for large times, showing aging and violation of\nthe time-translation invariance. Equations for the correlation and the response functions can be written using the same\nscaling ansatz as the single-p-spin model5,15 . For asymptotic but close times [t\u2032 \u2192 \u221e, t \u2212 t\u2032 = O(1)], time translation\ninvariance is recovered and the parameter q1 can be defined as in Eq. (11). For asymptotic and well separated times\n[t\u2032 \u2192 \u221e, t/t\u2032 = O(1)], the correlation function scales as C(t, t\u2032 ) = C(\u03bb), with \u03bb \u2261 t\u2032 /t \u2208 [0, 1] and C(1) = q1\n(the same scaling holding for the response). This regime defines another asymptotic parameter q0 = lim\u03bb\u21920 C(\u03bb).\nIn this temperature region, the asymptotic limit is fully described in terms of the three parameters q1 , q0 and p\u0303,\ntogether with the so-called fluctuation-dissipation ratio xdyn \u2261 T R(t, t\u2032 )/\u2202t\u2032 C(t, t\u2032 ) measuring the violation of the\nfluctuation-dissipation relation.

This feature also holds when T \u2032 = Td , which is relevant for understanding the behaviour of a cooling in\nthis system. Indeed an infinitely slow cooling is able to reach thermal equilibrium at any temperature above and\nat Td 24 : thus for temperatures T below Td an infinitely slow cooling is roughly equivalent to a dynamics starting\nthermalized at T \u2032 = Td . Our result then indicates that for this system the asymptotic states reached with a cooling\nare lower than those reached with a quench. Actually the difference between these asymptotic states is really very\n\n\f5\n\n0.75\nEcooling - Equench\n0.7\n\nq1\n\n-10\n\nq0\n\n-5\n\n-5\n\nTd\n\n-2 10\n\n0.65\n\n0.65\n\n~\np\n\nT\n\n0.653\n\n0.6\n\nTag\n\nT'\n\n0.55\n0.5\n\n0.52\n\n0.54\n\n0.56\n\n0.58\n\n0.6\n\n0.62\n\n0.64\n\n0.66\n\n0.68\n\nT\nFIG. 1: The dynamical parameters q1 , q0 and p\u0303 (curves); the mutual overlap q12 and the self-overlap obtained from the tap\ncomplexity computation (points).

Inset: difference between asymptotic energies in a quench and a cooling (see text).\n\ntiny (see inset of Fig. 1). To our knowledge this is the first analytically solvable model showing up a dependence of\nthe asymptotic dynamical states on the cooling schedule.\nNote also that the solution of Eqs. (12) has q0 6= 0. This means that the system never decorrelates completely.\nWe are observing aging together with a strong dynamic ergodicity breaking, contrary to the weak-ergodicity breaking\nscenario analyzed for this kind of models so far2 . As long as p\u0303 > 0 the initial condition is not forgotten by the aging\nsystem and thus the initial condition acts like a magnetic field, inducing q0 > 0.\nThe change in the dynamical behavior at T = Tag can be better understood by noticing that q1 > qm as long as\nT > Tag , and q1 = qm for T \u2264 Tag . The simplest interpretation is that states dominating the Gibbs measure at T \u2032\nare stable for T > Tag (T \u2032 ), but at Tag (T \u2032 ) they become marginal, forming a manifold where the system ages on. For\nT < Tag (T \u2032 ) these states become unstable and the system keeps aging in a nearby critical manifold with q1 = qm and\nq0 < q1 .\nThis interpretation also tells us that in the multi-p-spin model, contrary to the single-p-spin, it is not possible\nto 'follow' any state from T = 0 to finite temperature, or viceversa, because some states loose stability as the\ntemperature is varied and there may be birth/death of states with temperature. Moreover, changing the temperature\nthe complexity \u03a3 varies along the dynamical trajectory, implying that there is mixing of states. The variation in \u03a3\nis very tiny: e.g. for f (q) = q 3 /2 + (0.45)2 q 4 /2 is O(10\u22125 \u00f7 10\u22126 ) and for this reason it would be hardly visible in a\nnumerical simulation16 .\nIII.\n\nTHE CONSTRAINED COMPLEXITY\n\nTo confirm the interpretation given above and to better understand the dynamical behaviour, we can look more in\ndetails at the structure of the metastable states in the region where the asymptotic dynamics occurs. In particular,\nwe can consider the following static quantity. Given a reference state, that will be appropriately chosen as the state\nto which the initial configuration of the dynamics belongs, we compute the number of metastable states of given\nfree energy density that have fixed mutual overlap with it. Using the index 1 for the reference state and 2 for the\nmetastable states we wish to count, we compute N (q12 , f2 |f1 ) \u223c exp[N \u03a3(q12 , f2 |f1 )], that is the number of states of\n\n\f6\n\n0.015\n-5\n\n10\n\n\u03a3\n\n0.01\n\n\u03a3\n\n0\n\n-10\n\n-5\n\n0.56\n\n0.58\n\n0.6\n\n0.62\n\n0.64\n\nq12\n\n0.005\n\n0\n0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n0.6\n\n0.7\n\nq12\nFIG. 2: Constrained complexity as a function of the mutual overlap for T = 0.53 and T \u2032 = 0.653 (Tag = 0.527).

Temperatures are\nnot written explicitly, but it is assumed that T1 = T \u2032 and T2 = T .\nThis computation can be performed in the tap approach17, where metastable states are identified with local\nminima of the mean-field energy functional Ftap {m} = H{m} \u2212 1/(2\u03b2) log(1 \u2212 q) \u2212 \u03b22 (f (1) \u2212 f (q) \u2212 (1 \u2212 q)f \u2032 (q)),\nP\nwhere q \u2261 N \u22121 i m2i .

The other delta functions fix respectively the free energy densities and the\nmutual overlap of the solutions we wish to count. Note also that we have divided by the number of metastable states\nwith free energy f1 in order to get the number of states of free energy f2 with overlap q12 with a given reference state\nof kind 1 (otherwise we would have gotten the number of pairs).\nThe entropy related to (13), also called constrained complexity, can be computed using standard techniques18,19\nwithin the annealed approximation, which is in general adequate to treat large free energies f1 , f2 \u223c fth (see Appendix\nA). Alternatively, the entropy can be computed as the Legendre transform of a constrained thermodynamic free\nenergy15,20 . The two results coincide within numerical precision.\nLet us now use this constrained entropy to investigate the structure of the phase space sampled by the asymptotic\ndynamics. To this end, let us fix f1 = feq (\u03b2 \u2032 ) and f2 = fdyn (\u03b2) \u2261 Edyn (\u03b2) \u2212 T S(Edyn ). That is, the reference state is\nchosen as the state where the dynamics has been started in (an equilibrium state at temperature T \u2032 ), while the states\nto be counted have energy density equal to the asymptotic dynamical energy. The behaviour of \u03a3 as a function of q12\nis displayed in Fig. 2. We see that two different situations occur above and below Tag .\nFor T > Tag (T \u2032 ) the constrained complexity is positive and decreasing with increasing q12 , (as discussed for the\nsingle-p-spin in Ref. 18), it becomes negative at some value of the mutual overlap and touches back the zero axis for\nq12 = p\u0303 (see the lowest curve in the inset of Fig. 2), with p\u0303 given by the dynamical equations (12).

For small overlaps we are counting states in a very large manifold, and we thus find many of them.\nAs q12 decreases, this manifold becomes smaller and, consequently, the number of counted states decreases until when\nit becomes zero (negative complexity). However, if we still increase the overlap, looking closer to the reference state,\nat some point we are bound to find the state itself. This is signaled by the zero value of the complexity at q12 = p\u0303,\nwhich therefore represents the overlap between the reference state and the same state evolved at temperature T ,\nconsistently with the dynamical interpretation. In this point one also has q (2) \u2261 m(2) * m(2) /N = q1 , with q1 given\nagain by the dynamical equations. Please note that q (2) = q1 is not the typical value for tap states at temperature T\nand free-energy fdyn ; so the dynamics is restricted to a set of sub-dominant states, that can be selected by constraining\nthe tap measure as in (13). The interpretation is straightforward: the T \u2032 equilibrium state has evolved in a slightly\nmodified state at temperature T , which has overlap p\u0303 with the original one. This is the only state (i.e. \u03a3 = 0) that\nwe count at temperature T when fixing q12 = p\u0303. Note that this state is stable (by computing the replicon) and it is\n\"isolated\", that is the \u03a3 curve is negative in the (q12 , f2 ) plane around the point (p\u0303, fdyn ).\nFor T < Tag (T \u2032 ) the secondary peak of the constrained complexity becomes positive (see inset of Fig. 2) and the\n\u03a3 > 0 region in the (q12 , f2 ) plane (with f1 fixed) is shown in Fig. 3. The T \u2032 equilibrium state opens up at T = Tag (T \u2032 )\nand a non trivial structure of metastable states appears close to where the dynamics is taking place; these states are\nresponsible for the aging behavior, but it is still unclear which are the thermodynamical parameters of the dynamical\nasymptotic states. This is the main question when trying to describe the dynamical behavior in terms of static\nobservations.\nWe know that for T < Tag the dynamics is taking place on a marginal manifold, so we can fix q (2) = qm (T ): states\nwith this self-overlap are found along the full line in Fig.3. All the points along this line are possible candidates for\nthe asymptote of the dynamics, but understanding which one is actually chosen during system relaxation is a difficult\ntask.\nConsistently with the dynamical computation the point (p\u0303, fdyn ) is always on the line. Moreover, at this point,\nxst = xdyn holds, where xst (q12 , f2 ) \u2261 T \u2202f \u03a3(q12 , f, f1 )|f =f2 and xdyn is the dynamical fluctuation-dissipation ratio.\nIt seems that at least one dynamically computed quantity must be plugged in the static computation to predict the\nasymptotic states: this can be equivalently q12 = p\u0303 or xst = xdyn (for a quench the computation is easier: starting\nwith a random configuration one has q12 = 0 by definition). It would be very useful to find an extremizing principle\nto select, among all the candidate tap states, those which are actually reached by the constrained out of equilibrium\ndynamics.\n\n\f8\nIV.\n\nSUMMARY AND PERSPECTIVES\n\nThe spherical multi-p-spin model defined by the Hamiltonian (2) has the nice properties of being exactly solvable\n(thanks to its continuous variables), while showing non-trivial dependence on temperature of its states (birth, death\nand level crossing). These features makes the model more realistic than other mean-field models and a perfect\ncandidate for studying glassy relaxation under variations of temperature.\nWe have performed such a study finding several interesting analytical results. (i) The relaxation at any temperature\nconverges to tap states satisfying the supersymmetry between fermionic and bosonic integration variables. In order\nto understand whether tap states breaking the supersymmetry are relevant for finite times dynamics, the method\ndescribed in Ref. 21 could be applied to the present model. (ii) Energies reached by a cooling are lower than those\nreached by a quench. This result is based on the assumption than an infinitely slow cooling equilibrates at any\ntemperature T \u2265 Td , which needs to be improved. (iii) The solution to the dynamical equations is consistent with\nthe constrained complexity of tap states computed thermodynamically: starting from a thermalized configuration\nand lowering the temperature, the system starts aging when the state it belongs to becomes marginally unstable. For\nlower temperatures, states where aging is taking place cannot be predicted solely from the constrained complexity; a\nnew extremizing principle is needed in order to make the connection between static and dynamic computations.\nAcknowledgments\n\nWe thank A.

However, in that paper there was a mistake in one of such equations and the\noff-equilibrium dynamics was not solved.\nConvergence to equilibrium at Td is a subtle point: there are no O(N ) barriers (states are marginal), and so the equilibration\ntime is less than exponential in N (we expect it to grow polynomially with N ).\n\nAPPENDIX A: THE CONSTRAINED COMPLEXITY VIA THE TAP APPROACH\n\nStarting from Eq. (13), the computation of the constrained complexity can be performed with standard techniques.\nThe annealed computation is the simpler one, since it involves averaging directly the number of solutions over the\n\n\f9\nquenched disorder, rather than its logarithm. Replicas are therefore not needed.\nTo proceed, we introduce bosonic representations for the delta functions appearing in Eq. (13), and fermionic\nrepresentations for the two determinants (the modulus can be safely disregarded for this model, since one can show\nthat minima dominate over saddles in the relevant free energy density range22 ).
