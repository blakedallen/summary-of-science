Differential dilepton spectra from heavyion collisions thus can provide information about the effective degrees of freedom at high\nbaryon density and temperature. Apart from that the in-medium properties of hadrons\n(cf. Refs. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]), that are closely related to the latter problem, can be explored as well. According to QCD sum rules [2, 5, 7] as well as QCD inspired effective\nLagrangian models [1, 3, 4, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14] especially the vector mesons (\u03c1, \u03c9 and\n\u03c6) significantly change their properties with nuclear density. It has been argued, that the\nexperimentally observed enhanced production of soft lepton pairs above known sources in\nnucleus-nucleus collisions at SPS energies [15, 16] might be due to the in-medium modification of vector mesons [17, 18, 19, 20, 21] rather than reflecting a new state of hadronic\nmatter.\nDileptons from heavy-ion collisions have also been measured by the DLS Collaboration [22, 23] at BEVALAC energies, where a different temperature and density regime is\nprobed. The first generation of DLS data [22], based on a limited data set, were consistent with the results from early transport model calculations [24, 25, 26, 27] including the\nconventional dileptons sources as pn bremsstrahlung, \u03c0 0 , \u03b7, \u03c9 and \u2206 Dalitz decay, direct\ndecay of vector mesons and pion-pion annihilation, without incorporating any medium\neffects. A more recent DLS measurement [23] including the full data set and an improved analysis, however, shows an increase by about a factor of 5-7 in the cross section\nin comparison to Ref. [22] and the early theoretical predictions.\nThis enhancement of the e+ e\u2212 yield in nucleus-nucleus collisions provides some theoretical 'puzzle'. In Ref. [28] the in-medium \u03c1 spectral functions from Refs. [13, 14] have been\nimplemented in the HSD transport approach for \u03c1 mesons produced in baryon-baryon,\npion-baryon collisions as well as from \u03c0\u03c0 annihilation, and a factor of 2-3 enhancement\nhas been obtained compared to the case of a free \u03c1-spectral function. In Ref. [29] dropping vector meson masses and \u03c9 meson broadening were incorporated in the UrQMD\ntransport model, which also showed an enhancement of the dilepton yield, however, the\nauthors could not describe the new DLS data [23] as well. Another attempt to solve the\nDLS 'puzzle' has been performed in Ref. [30] where the dropping hadron mass scenario\nwas considered together with the subthreshold \u03c1 production in \u03c0N scattering via the\nbaryonic resonance N(1520) whose importance was pointed out in Refs. [14, 31]. It was\nfound that the enhancement of the dilepton spectra due to low mass \u03c1's from the N(1520)\nwas not sufficient to match the DLS data. Thus, all in-medium scenarios that successfully\nhave explained the dilepton enhancement at SPS energies failed to describe the new DLS\ndilepton data [23] from heavy-ion collisions (12 C +12 C and 40 Ca +40 Ca).\n2\n\n\fIn 1998 the DLS Collaboration has, furthermore, published dilepton data from elementary pp and pd collisions at 1-5 GeV [32] which provides the possibility for an independent\ncheck of the elementary dilepton channels that enter as 'input' in transport calculations\nfor heavy-ion reactions. Such an analysis has been carried out in Refs. [29, 33] and it was\nshown that the dilepton invariant mass spectra from pp reactions in the energy range from\n1 \u2013 5 GeV could be rather well described within the standard sources of hadronic Dalitz\nand direct decays when including also the 'subthreshold' production of \u03c1-mesons by baryonic resonances 1 . It has been, furthermore, argued that additional channels (like dilepton decays of scalar mesons (a0 , f0 ) or four-body final states decays like \u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 e+ e\u2212 ,\n(\u03c10 , \u03c9) \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 e+ e\u2212 , (\u03c10 , \u03c9) \u2192 \u03b7\u03c0 0 e+ e\u2212 ) might contribute to the elementary yield in pp\nand pd reactions [34]. Thus it is indispensible, that also these elementary reactions have\nto be measured again with high resolution in order to understand more accurately the\ne+ e\u2212 radiation mechanisms.\nIn this article we perform a detailed study of dilepton production from pp, pd and\npBe collisions from 1 \u2013 5 GeV including all channels as described in Ref. [33], i.e. the\nsubthreshold \u03c1 production via baryonic resonances (e.g. D13 (1520), P11 (1710)) as well\nas \u03c0 0 , \u03b7, \u03c9 and \u2206 Dalitz decays and the direct decay of vector mesons (\u03c1, \u03c9, \u03c6). We\ninvestigate the role of isospin degrees of freedom with respect to dilepton production in\npd reactions by employing exact energy-momentum conservation for the deuteron target.\nThe pBe reactions are calculated within the resonance transport model [35] that includes\nthe same elementary production amplitudes.\nThe paper is organized as follows: In Section 2 we briefly present the underlying resonance model that enters the coupled-channel BUU transport approach. In Section 3 we\nprovide a comparison of our results with the corresponding DLS data including the DLS\nacceptance and resolution functions. In Section 4 we, furthermore, give detailed predictions for these reactions with a high mass resolution in view of upcoming experiments\nwith the HADES detector at GSI Darmstadt. We close with a summary and discussion\nof open problems in Section 5.\n\n2\n\nDescription of the model\n\n2.1\n\nResonance approach\n\nWe perform our analysis of dilepton production from pp, pd and pBe collisions within\nthe resonance approach of Refs. [35, 36]. This model is based on the resonance concept\n\u221a\nof nucleon-nucleon and meson-nucleon interactions at low invariant energy s [37] by\nadopting all resonance parameters from the Manley analysis [38]; all states with at least\n1\n\nFor a detailed description of the individual channels we refer the reader to Ref. [33].\n\n3\n\n\f2 stars in Ref. [38] are taken into account: P33 (1232), P11 (1440), D13 (1520), S11 (1535),\nP33 (1600), S31 (1620), S11 (1650), D15 (1675), F15 (1680), P13 (1879), S31 (1900), F35 (1905),\nP31 (1910), D35 (1930), F37 (1950), F17 (1990), G17 (2190), D35 (2350). These resonances couple to the following channels: N\u03c0, N\u03b7, N\u03c9, \u039bK, \u2206(1232)\u03c0, N\u03c1, N\u03c3, N(1440)\u03c0, \u2206(1232)\u03c1\nwith respect to the production and decay.\nIt has been shown, that the resonance model provides a good description of the experimental data on one- and two-pion production in nucleon-nucleon collisions at low energy\n[37]. However, with increasing energy the resonance contributions underestimate the\ndata; the missing yield is then treated as a backgraund term to the resonance amplitude.\nThis background term 'mimics' t-channel particle production mechanism as well as other\nnon-resonance contributions (e.g., direct NN \u2192 NN\u03c0, without creating an intermediate\nresonance).\nWith increasing energy, furthermore, the multiparticle production becomes more and\n\u221a\nmore important. The high energy collisions \u2013 above s = 2.6 GeV for baryon-baryon\n\u221a\ncollisions and s = 2.2 GeV for meson-baryon collisions \u2013 are described by the LUND\nstring fragmentation model FRITIOF [39]. This aspect is similar to that used in the HSD\napproach [40, 20, 41, 42] and the UrQMD model [43].\nThis combined resonance-string approach allows to calculate particle production in\nbaryon-baryon and meson-baryon collisions from low to high energies. The collisional\ndynamics for proton-nucleus reactions, furthermore, is described by the coupled-channel\nBUU transport approach [35, 36] that is based on the same elementary cross sections.\n\n2.2\n\nDilepton production\n\nThe dilepton production within the resonance model can be schematically presented in\nthe following way:\nBB \u2192 RX\n\n(1)\n\nmB \u2192 RX\n\n(2)\n\nR \u2192 e+ e\u2212 X,\n\n(3)\n\nR \u2192 R\u2032 X, R\u2032 \u2192 e+ e\u2212 X.\n\n(5)\n\nR \u2192 mX, m \u2192 e+ e\u2212 X,\n\n(4)\n\nIn words: in a first step a resonance R might be produced in baryon-baryon (BB) or\nmeson-baryon (mB) collisions \u2013 (1), (2). Then this resonance can couple to dileptons\ndirectly \u2013 (3) (e.g., Dalitz decay of the \u2206 resonance: \u2206 \u2192 e+ e\u2212 N) or decays to a meson\nm (+ baryon) \u2013 (4) which produces dileptons via direct decays (\u03c1, \u03c9) or Dalitz decays\n(\u03c0 0 , \u03b7, \u03c9). The resonance R might also decay into another resonance R\u2032 \u2013 (5) which\nlater produces dileptons via Dalitz decay or again via meson decays (e.g., D35 (1930) \u2192\n4\n\n\f\u2206\u03c1, \u2206 \u2192 e+ e\u2212 N, \u03c1 \u2192 e+ e\u2212 ). Note, that in our combined model the final particles\n\u2013 which couple to dileptons \u2013 can be produced also via non-resonant mechanisms, i.e.\n'background' at low and intermediate energies and string decay at high energies.\nThe electromagnetic part of all conventional dilepton sources \u2013 \u03c0 0 , \u03b7, \u03c9 and \u2206 Dalitz\ndecay, direct decay of vector mesons \u03c1, \u03c9 \u2013 are treated in the same way as described\nin detail in Sec. 3 of Ref. [33] where we have calculated the dilepton spectra from pp\ncollisions in comparison to the DLS data. The only difference is that in our present\ncalculation we use the spectral function of vector mesons (\u03c1, \u03c9) in the same form as for\nall other resonances as used in Manley analysis [38]:\nf (M) = NV\n\n2\nM 2 \u0393Vtot\n.\n\u03c0 (M 2 \u2212 m2V )2 + (M\u0393Vtot )2\n\n(6)\n\nIn (6) NV guarantees normalization to unity, i.e. f (M)dM = 1, while \u0393Vtot is the total\nvector meson width.\nFor pd and pBe collisions we also take into account pn bremstrahlung using the softphoton approximation [44], where the radiation from internal meson lines is neglected and\nthe strong interaction vertex is assumed to be on-shell. In this case the strong interaction\npart and the electromagnetic part separate; however, the cross section for dileptons has to\nbe corrected [45, 46] by reducing the phase-space for the colliding particles in their finalstate. We discard pp bremsstrahlung from the nucleon pole since the microscopic OBE\ncalculations [47, 48, 49] have shown that at 1.0 GeV the pp bremsstrahlung is smaller than\nthe \u2206 Dalitz decay contribution by a factor of 2-3. At this energy also the interference\nbetween nucleon and \u2206-pole terms is negligible. At high energies, where this interference\nbecomes important [47], however, the overall contribution from these channels is negligible\n(see below). We, furthermore, discard e+ e\u2212 production from the scalar mesons f0 , a0 as\nadvocated in Ref. [34] since our studies in Ref. [50] have indicated that the multiplicity\nof scalar mesons in pp reactions is very small in the energy regime of interest.\nThe basic underlying assumption for dilepton production, that enters in our calculation, is that the amplitude can be factorized into a meson or/and resonance production\nand a dilepton decay part. This assumption provides not only a significant simplification,\nwhich is necessary for applications in transport calculations [25, 42, 35], but also allows to\ntake into account the 'inelasticity' from many-particle production channels which become\ndominant at high energy.\nIn Fig. 1 we illustrate our factorization assumption for the process NN \u2192 RN \u2192\n\u03c1NN \u2192 e+ e\u2212 NN with an intermediate resonance R coupled to the \u03c1 meson, e.g. D13 (1520),\nwhich is responsible for \u03c1 production below the threshold. As shown in Fig. 1 we cut the\ndiagram twice such that we have a resonance production part (NN \u2192 RN), a resonance\ndecay to the \u03c1 meson (R \u2192 \u03c1N) and direct dilepton decay of the \u03c1 meson (\u03c1 \u2192 e+ e\u2212 ).\nThis assumption with respect to subthreshold \u03c1 production via the D13 (1520) is different\nR\n\n5\n\n\fto the ansatz used in the previous dilepton analysis [30, 33]. In Ref. [33] we have factorized the amplitude NN \u2192 RN \u2192 \u03c1NN \u2192 e+ e\u2212 NN into a D13 (1520) production part\n(NN \u2192 RN) and Dalitz decay part R \u2192 \u03c1N \u2192 e+ e\u2212 N (cf. Sect. 3.1 of Ref. [33]). In\nthe latter approach the \u03c1 meson is considered to be off-shell, i.e. a virtual particle, and\ncan have a mass below 2m\u03c0 which leads to the Dalitz behavior of the dilepton spectra\n(cf. Fig. 3 of Ref. [33]), whereas in the present approach we assume that the \u03c1 meson\nhas a free spectral function with masses only above 2m\u03c0 . The latter assumption leads to\nthe 'direct \u03c1 decay' profile for dileptons from subthreshold \u03c1's and is consistent with our\nresonance prescription used also in the transport calculations [35], where we propagate\nsuch \u03c1 mesons explicitly.\nTo compare with the experimental data of the DLS Collaboration one has to use the\nappropriate experimental filter, which is a function of the dilepton invariant mass M,\ntransverse momentum pT and rapidity ylab in the laboratory frame \u2013 F (M, pT , ylab ). For\nthat purpose we explicitly simulate all dileptons by Monte-Carlo and apply the filter\nF (M, pT , ylab ).\n\n3\n3.1\n\ne+e\u2212 results in comparison to DLS data\nDileptons from pp collisions\n\nIn Fig. 2 we present the calculated dilepton invariant mass spectra d\u03c3/dM for pp collisions\nfrom 1.0 \u2013 4.9 GeV including the final mass resolution and filter F (M, pT , ylab ) from the\nDLS Collaboration (version 4.1) in comparison to the DLS data [32]. The thin lines\nindicate the individual contributions from the different production channels; i.e. starting\nfrom low M: Dalitz decay \u03c0 0 \u2192 \u03b3e+ e\u2212 (short dashed line), \u03b7 \u2192 \u03b3e+ e\u2212 (dotted line),\n\u2206 \u2192 Ne+ e\u2212 (dashed line), \u03c9 \u2192 \u03c0 0 e+ e\u2212 (dot-dashed line), for M \u2248 0.7 GeV: \u03c9 \u2192 e+ e\u2212\n(dot-dashed line), \u03c10 \u2192 e+ e\u2212 (short dashed line). The full solid line represents the sum\nof all sources considered here.\nWhereas at 1.04 GeV the dileptons stem practically all from \u03c0 0 and \u2206 Dalitz decays, \u03c1\ndecay becomes more important with increasing energy and at high invariant mass. Note,\nthat in the present analysis we do not separate the production mechanism for \u03c1 mesons\nas in Ref. [33], i.e. the \u03c1-meson contribution might come from the decay of D13 (1520)\nand P11 (1710) or non-resonance \u03c1 production. Thus, the short dashed line (denoted as\n\u03c10 \u2192 e+ e\u2212 ) presents the sum of all \u03c1 contributions. However, the resonance mechanism\ndominates for \u03c1 production at low energies, especially below the pp \u2192 \u03c1pp threshold\n\u221a\n\u221a\ns < 2mN + m\u03c1 , where s is the invariant collision energy (see Sec. 2 in Ref. [33]).\nAt 2.1 and 4.9 GeV the dilepton yield is dominated by the \u03b7 Dalitz decay and direct\ndecays of \u03c1 and \u03c9 mesons. The \u03c1 spectrum is enhanced towards low M due to the limited\n\n6\n\n\fphase space and strong mass dependence (M \u22123 ) of the dilepton decay width [33] in line\nwith the vector dominance model. Note, that at 2.1 GeV we use the resonance production\nmechanism in our model, whereas at 4.9 GeV most of the particles are produced by string\ndecays. Within the strict resonance model which gives only the exclusive pp \u2192 pp\u03b7 cross\nsection the \u03b7 yield from pp collisions is underestimated by about a factor of 2 (dot-dotdashed line) at 2.1 GeV. Since at this energy other channels such as NN\u03b7\u03c0, NN\u03b7\u03c0\u03c0 are\nopen, we have estimated the cross section for these channels by the string model and\nadded it to the total \u03b7 yield. This gives the final \u03b7 contribution (dotted line) for 2.1 GeV.\n\n3.2\n\nDileptons from pd collisions\n\nThe experimental measurement of dilepton spectra from proton and deuteron targets\nprovides a unique possibility to get information about the isospin dependence of the\nNN interaction which is interesting in itself and, furthermore, important with respect to\nheavy-ion reactions. The pp and pd dilepton data from the DLS Collaboration [32] are\nthe first experimental step in this direction.\nSince the deuteron is a bound system of proton and neutron, the Fermi motion of\nthe nucleons plays an important role for all interactions. For example, Fermi motion\n\u221a\nleads to a shift of the threshold for particle production in pd interactions to lower s,\ni.e. the channels closed by kinematics in pp collisions might be open in pd. Thus, the\npd reactions can not be directly approximated by the simple sum of pp and pn. On the\nother hand, one can't treat the deuteron within the usual mean-field approach used in\ntransport calculations for more heavy nuclei.\nIn our analysis we thus take into account the Fermi motion of nucleons using the\nmomentum distribution of the deuteron calculated with the Paris potential [51]. We\ninitialize a deuteron in momentum space (using a Monte Carlo method) according to the\nmomentum distribution f (p):\nf (p) =\n\n|\u03a8(p)|2\n,\n|\u03a8(0)|2\n\n(7)\n\nwhere p is the momentum of a nucleon in the deuteron center-of-mass, while \u03a8(p) is the\ndeuteron wave function. To fulfill the binding energy constraint we assume\nEspec =\n\nq\n\np2 + m2N , Epart = Ed \u2212 Espec.\n\n(8)\n\nThe nucleon, which does not participate in the reaction, i.e. the spectator, has a free\ndispersion relation for the energy-momentum Espec , whereas Epart is the energy of the\nnucleon participating in the reaction (participant). In (8) Ed = 2mN + \u03b5 is the total\ndeuteron energy, where \u03b5 = \u22122.2 MeV is the binding energy of the deuteron.\n\u221a\nThe invariant collision-energy distribution dN/d s for pd reactions calculated with\nthe dispersion relation (8) is shown by the solid histogram in Fig. 3. For comparison\n7\n\n\f\u221a\n(dashed histogram) we present the dN/d s distribution in the physical region (2mN \u2264\n\u221a\n\u221a\ns \u2264 smax ) calculated with f (p) (7) in the quasi-free scattering limit, i.e.\nusing the free\nq\ndispersion relation for both nucleons in the deuteron: Espec = Epart = p2 + m2N . The\n\u221a\n\u221a\nlower limit of s is given by the free cross section that only exists for \u22652mN . As seen\nfrom Fig. 3, both prescriptions are the same in the peak value, however, the deuteron\n\u221a\n\u221a\nspectral distribution (8) leads to an enhancement of the s distribution at small s and\n\u221a\na reduction at high s. This implies a substantial lowering of particle production at high\n\u221a\ns with respect to the quasi-free limit, which has been often used in the literature.\nWithin the 'binding' prescription (8) we have calculated the dilepton invariant mass\nspectra d\u03c3/dM for pd collisions from 1.0 \u2013 4.9 GeV including the final mass resolution\nand filter F (M, pT , ylab ) from the DLS Collaboration (version 4.1). The results are show\nin Fig. 4 in comparison to the DLS data [32], where the assignment of the lines is the\nsame as in Fig. 2. Additionally, the dot-dot-dashed lines indicate the pn bremsstrahlung\ncontributions.\nSimilar to Fig. 2, at 1.04 GeV the \u03c0 0 and \u2206 dalitz decays are dominant, however,\ndue to the larger mass of the deuteron, the \u03b7 channel is already open contrary to the\npp reaction and the subthreshold \u03c1 branch is getting more important at high invariant\nmass M. Also pn bremsstrahlung contributes at low energies, however, with increasing\nbombarding energy it becomes less important.\nStarting from 1.61 GeV the dominant contribution at low M is again the \u03b7 Dalitz\ndecay, whereas at high M the dileptons stem basically from direct \u03c1, \u03c9 decays. The \u03b7\n\u221a\ncontribution here is calculated by assuming \u03c3pn\u2192pn\u03b7 = 6\u03c3pp\u2192pp\u03b7 for 2.425 GeV \u2264 s \u2264\n2.517 GeV in line with the experimental data from Ref. [52], \u03c3pn\u2192pn\u03b7 = 2.5\u03c3pp\u2192pp\u03b7 for\n\u221a\n\u221a\n2.517 GeV \u2264 s \u2264 2.65 GeV and \u03c3pn\u2192pn\u03b7 \u2243 \u03c3pp\u2192pp\u03b7 for s \u2265 2.65 GeV where the\nmultiparticle production (above 2.65 GeV) is evaluated within the LUND string model.\n\u221a\nNote, that at high s the isospin asymmetry \u03c3pn /\u03c3pp should be washed out by the isospin\nof pions that are created together with the \u03b7. Though this 'recipe' seems to work in\ncomparison to the DLS data, we point out that further experimental data with good\nmass resolution will be necessery to clarify the situation for the isospin couplings.\nIn order to demonstrate the importance of isospin degrees-of-freedom for dilepton\nproduction we present in Fig. 5 the invariant mass spectra d\u03c3/dM for pp (short dashed\nline), pn (long dashed line), pp + pn (dot-dashed line) and pd (solid line) collisions at 1.61\nGeV in comparison to the DLS data [32]. At these energies the pn channel gives the main\ncontribution to the pd dilepton yield. Furthermore, the influence of the Fermi motion\nin the deuteron is clearly seen at high invariant mass M by comparing the dot-dashed\n(pp + pn) and solid (pd) lines.\nIn Fig. 6 we present the excitation function, i.e. the integrated dilepton cross section\n\u221a\nfor masses above 0.15 GeV, as a function of the available energy Q = s \u2212 2mp for pp\n8\n\n\f(dashed line) and pd (solid line) in comparison to the DLS data [32] (open circles for pp\nand full circles for pd). The calculated excitation functions for pp and pd increase with\nthe energy and stay within the experimental errorbars.\n\n3.3\n\nDileptons from pBe collisions\n\nSince Be is one of the lightest nuclei, in-medium effects play a minor role because most\nhadron decays occur already in vacuum. So one can consider pBe collisions as an additional and independent check for the elementary reactions and isospin degrees of freedom.\nHowever, the collisional dynamics has to be taken into account properly. For that purpose\nwe use the coupled-channel BUU transport approach as discussed in Sec. 2.\nDileptons from pBe have been measured by the DLS Collaboration in the end of the\n80's [22]. In Fig. 7 we show the calculated dilepton invariant mass spectra d\u03c3/dM for\npBe collisions at 1.0 (upper part), 2.1 (middle part) and 4.9 GeV (lower part) including\nthe final mass resolution and filter F (M, pT , ylab ) from the DLS Collaboration (version\n1.6) in comparison to the data [22]. The assignment of the lines is the same as in Figs. 2\nand 4. With the filter 1.6 we do not get enough suppression for the dilepton yield at\nM \u2264 0.15 GeV which basically stems from \u03c0 0 Dalitz decay. Similar to pd reactions the\ndominant channels at 1.0 GeV are the \u2206 Dalitz decay and pn bremsstrahlung. At 2.1 and\n4.9 GeV the \u03b7 Dalitz decay becomes important at low M and the direct decays of vector\nmesons (\u03c1, \u03c9) for M \u223c 0.8 GeV. Within the present model we slightly overestimate the\ndata at 4.9 GeV, however, we discard any discussion about the physical reason since the\n'old' DLS filter is not sufficiently understood. For example, the 'old' DLS data for pBe at\n4.9 GeV show a similar dilepton yield as for pd, whereas according to our calculations it\nshould be higher by a factor of \u223c 2 since more nucleons are involved in the pBe reaction.\nIn this respect we have performed detailed calculations for pp, pd and pBe reactions\nwithout implementing any filter, however, including a high (10 MeV) mass resolution for\nd\u03c3/dM. For the results, that can be controlled by the HADES Collaboration in near\nfuture, we refer to the following Section.\n\n4\n\nPredictions for HADES\n\nIn this Section we present our predictions for the dilepton invariant mass spectra, transverse momentum (pT ) distributions and rapidity (y) distributions for pp, pd and pBe\ncollisons at 1.5 GeV and 4.0 GeV, which will be measured with the HADES spectrometer\nat GSI.\nIn Fig. 8 the calculated dilepton invariant mass spectra d\u03c3/dM for pp (upper part),\npd (middle part) and pBe collisions (lower part) at 1.5 GeV (left panel) and 4.0 GeV\n\n9\n\n\f(right panel) are shown including a \u2206M = 10 MeV mass resolution. The assignment of\nthe lines is the same as in Figs. 2 and 4. The dominant contribution at low M (> m\u03c00 )\nis the \u03b7 Dalitz decay, however, for M > 0.4 GeV the dileptons stem basically all from\ndirect vector meson decays (\u03c1 and \u03c9). Within a 10 MeV mass resolution the peak from\nthe direct \u03c9 decay (which was completely smeared out within the DLS mass resolution)\nis seen. The \u03c9 peak is getting more pronounced at high energy (cf. the right panel of\nFig. 8).\nIn Fig. 9 we present the transverse momentum distribution d\u03c3/dpT /(2\u03c0pT ) for pp\n(upper part), pd (middle part) and pBe collisions (lower part) at 1.5 GeV (left panel) and\n4.0 GeV (right panel). The assignment of the lines again is the same as in Figs. 2 and\n4. Here we did not imply any cut in the invariant mass M. For all systems and energies\nconsidered the \u03c0 0 Dalitz decay is much higher than all other contributions, which is in\nline with the result of Fig. 8 because the pion production cross section is much larger\nthan that for the other mesons. The shape of the \u03c0 0 , \u03b7, \u2206, \u03c9 Dalitz decays is defined by\nthe kinematics of the Dalitz decay and the 'flat' part at low pT depends on the mass of\nthe decaying resonance.\nThe laboratory rapidity distributions d\u03c3/dy for pp (upper part), pd (middle part) and\npBe collisions (lower part) at 1.5 GeV (left panel) and 4.0 GeV (right panel) are shown in\nFig. 10, where the assignment of the lines is the same as before. The situation is similar\nto Fig. 9, \u2013 the \u03c0 0 Dalitz decay is the only visible contribution when imposing no cuts on\nthe invariant mass.\nIn order to make the contribution from other channels visible one has to suppress the\n'background' \u03c0 0 yield. In Fig. 11 we display the transverse momentum spectra for pp\n(upper part), pd (middle part) and pBe collisions (lower part) at 1.5 GeV (left panel)\nand 4.0 GeV (right panel) using a cut in invariant mass as 0.4 GeV\u2264 M \u2264 0.7 GeV.\nFig. 12 shows the laboratory rapidity distributions for the same systems and kinematical\nconditions. With this cut on intermediate dilepton masses one can select the region where\nthe \u03c0 0 Dalitz decay is totally removed and the \u03b7 Dalitz decay is suppressed substantially\n(cf. Fig. 8); in this way the \u03c1 branch in the transverse momentum and rapidity spectra\nbecomes seen (cf. Figs. 10, 11). Thus, a measurement of the transverse momentum and\nrapidity spectra with a corresponging cut in M will provide additional and independent\ninformation about the \u03c1 contribution to the dilepton spectra.\nFinally, in Fig. 13 we present the double differential dilepton spectra d\u03c3/dMdpT as\na function of the invariant mass M and transverse momentum pT for pd collisions at 4.0\nGeV. At fixed pT one can recognize the shape of the invariant mass spectra (cf. Fig. 8)\nwith a strong \u03c0 0 Dalitz decay branch at low M as well as the contributions from \u03b7 Dalitz\ndecay and the vector meson (\u03c1, \u03c9) decays. At fixed M the shape looks similar to the\none in Fig. 9. At low M the exponential decrease stems from \u03c0 0 Dalitz decay, then the\n\n10\n\n\fspectra become flatter due to the contributions from \u03b7 Dalitz (M \u2264 0.4 GeV) and direct\n\u03c1 decays. At M \u223c 0.78 GeV the peak from the direct decay of \u03c9 mesons is visible. Thus,\nsuch type of 3-dimensional experimental information (or even 4-dimensional including\nrapidity) allows to select the contributions from different channels.\n\n5\n\nSummary\n\nWithin the framework of the combined resonance-string approach we have performed a\ndetailed study of dilepton production from pp, pd and pBe collisions at 1.0 \u2013 4.9 GeV. In\nthis approach the particle production proceeds through resonances at low energies and by\nstring formation and decay at high energies. The collisional dynamics is described by the\ncoupled-channel BUU transport approach. As dilepton sources we have considered \u03c0 0 , \u03b7,\n\u03c9 and \u2206 Dalitz decays, pn bremsstrahlung and direct decays of vector mesons (\u03c1, \u03c9).\nWe have compared our calculated results to the experimental data of the DLS Collaboration which provide constraints on the different individual production channels. It\nhas been found that the DLS data for the pp and pd collisions can be reasonably well\ndescribed in our model whereas for pBe systems (especially at 4.9 GeV) our calculations\ngive a slightly higher dilepton yield. We have demonstrated the importance to measure\nthe dileptons from pp and pd (or even pBe) collisions simultaneously since such data\ncan provide constraints on the isospin dependence of pp and pn interactions, which is\nimportant for an understanding of heavy-ion data.\nDilepton spectra from elementary reactions will be measured in future by the HADES\ndetector at GSI Darmshtadt with high mass resolution and good accuracy. In this respect\nwe have made predictions for the dilepton invariant mass spectra, transverse momentum\nand rapidity distributions for pp, pd and pBe at 1.5 and 4.0 GeV. We showed that proper\ncuts in invariant mass for transverse momentum and rapidity spectra allow to select\ndifferent dilepton sources and to study, for example, the \u03c1 meson channel in more detail.\nWe have indicated, furthermore, that it might be very useful to provide experimentally\nmulti-dimensional information, e.g. double differential dilepton spectra d\u03c3/dMdpT , in\norder to investigate the individual contributions.\n\nAcknowledgements\nThe authors are grateful for valuable discussions with J.
