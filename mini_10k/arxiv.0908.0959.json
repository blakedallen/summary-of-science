For 6 Li\ncalculations up to 16h\u0304\u03c9 have been achieved [1]. Among\nthe successes of the model is its predicted energy spectra\nof light nuclei [1, 2, 3]. Towards the end of the p-shell\na 10h\u0304\u03c9 basis calculation has been achieved for A=11 [4].\nIn mass 12 the model provides a reasonable description\nof the low-momentum component of the vector and axial\ncurrents involved in the electro-weak transitions to the\nground state on 12 N when a three-body interaction is included [6]. In all of these calculations, a Lee-Suzuki [5]\ntransformation of the nucleon-nucleon interaction is used\nto account for the restricted nature of the space in terms\nof an effective interaction. Group theoretical analyses [7]\nof the no-core shell model wave functions have shown that\nthe predicted eigenstates of 12 C and 16 O have very large\noverlaps with a small sub-space of the full model space,\nwith the sub-space being defined by the most deformed\nsymplectic basis states. The purpose of this paper is to\nexamine the structure of the multi-h\u0304\u03c9 terms in the wave\nfunctions for the low-lying states at the beginning and\nend of the p-shell in more detail. For this we compare\nNCSM predictions with measured elastic and inelastic\n(e, e\u2032 ) charge form factors in 6 Li and 12 C.\nThe shape of the electron scattering form factors provides a direct probe of the magnitude and structure of\nthe higher shell components in the wave functions. The\ncharge form factors have the additional advantage that\n\ntwo-body meson-exchange currents do not contribute significantly to the form factors below about 2 fm\u22121 [8]. In\nall (e, e\u2032 ) calculations presented here we use a bare onebody operator; as discussed below, the introduction of\nan effective operator (to compensate for the truncated\nmodel space) does not significantly affect our conclusions.\nOur first main finding is that the ph amplitudes that\ncontribute significantly to electron scattering appear with\nthe opposite sign to that needed to replicate the experimental form factors, elastic and inelastic, and the charge\nradii. The 2h\u0304\u03c9 contributions to the inelastic form factor change sign, in agreement with experiment, for sufficiently large model spaces for 6 Li; however, higher-order\nterms do not within the model spaces we examined. Second we show that the symplectic (\u03bb, \u03bc), \u2206h\u0304\u03c9 = 2 ph\namplitudes in the wave functions are sensitive functions\nof the oscillator parameter.\nII.\n\nTHE ELASTIC C0 FORM FACTORS\n\nThe ground state C0 form factor is the Fourier transform of the charge density, and contributions from twobody charge operators and/or relativistic corrections are\nnegligible for momenta up to about 2 f m\u22121 [8]. In a harmonic oscillator (HO) basis, the 0h\u0304\u03c9 p-shell charge form\nfactor is given by\n\u221a\nF0p\u22120p (q 2 ) = 3(1 \u2212 2/3y)exp(\u2212y)\n(1)\nwhere y = (bq/2)2 and b is the oscillator parameter.\nWhen additional shells are added to the model space\nthe new contributions to the form factor fall into two\n\n\f2\nmain classes. The first of these are the in-shell contributions (e.g. 1s0d \u2212 1s0d, 1p0f \u2212 1p0f , etc.) determined by the occupation numbers for the higher shells,\nand the second are from cross-shell ph excitations (e.g.\n0s \u2212 1s, 0p \u2212 1p, 0s \u2212 2s, etc.). At low q the form factor\nis determined by the charge radius\n\n0\n\n10\n\nStanford\n0h\u03c9\n2h\u03c9\n4h\u03c9\n10h\u03c9\n14h\u03c9\n\n-1\n\n10\n\n-2\n\n10\n\n-3\n\n< r2 > q 2\n+ O(q 4 )\nF (q ) = 1 \u2212\n6\n2\n\n10\n2\n\n(2)\n\nand the higher in-shell contributions can be shown always to add constructively to the charge radius. The\ncross-shell excitations (which for HO wave functions contribute to the charge radius only for \u2206h\u0304\u03c9 = 2 ph excitations across two shells) can add constructively or destructively. In a 2h\u0304\u03c9 calculation for p-shell nuclei there\nare two possible cross-shell contributions, namely,\nF0s\u22121s (q 2 ) =\n\nF0p\u22121p (q 2 ) =\n\np\n2/3y exp(\u2212y)\n\n(3)\n\np\n10/3y(1 \u2212 2/5 y) exp(\u2212y)\n\nBoth of these transform under SU(3) as (\u03bb, \u03bc) = (2, 0)\nand represent the 2h\u0304\u03c9 symplectic contributions to the\nform factors. When these and/or higher shell \u2206h\u0304\u03c9 =\n2 ph excitations appear with a sign so as to enhance\nthe predicted charge radius, they pull in the charge form\nfactor in momentum space.\nA.\n\nC0 form factor for 6 Li\n\nBoth elastic and inelastic scattering from 6 Li have been\nstudied extensively [9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]. Our calculations use the CD Bonn nucleon-nucleon interaction [15].\nThe predicted ground state energy of 6 Li is least sensitive\nto the choice of the oscillator parameter b over increasing\nbasis size for b = 1.79 fm (h\u0304\u03c9 = 13 MeV) [1], which is\nthe value we use in the present (e,e') calculations. We\nnote that, because of the increased computational difficulties in calculating the transition density matrix elements needed for the (e,e') form factors, the present\ncalculations are restricted to a maximum model space of\n14h\u0304\u03c9, to be compared with the 16h\u0304\u03c9 model spaces used\nto calculate the energy spectra for 6 Li.\nFigure 1 compares the experimental data for the elastic\nform factor for 6 Li with the model predictions. For model\nspaces up to 10h\u0304\u03c9, the predicted form factor moves out\nfurther in momentum space as the basis is increased. For\nthe largest model space examined, 14h\u0304\u03c9, the tend begins to reverse. In coordinate space the predicted charge\ndensity (Figure 2) is enhanced in the interior, with little change to the tail as higher shells are added. These\ntrends reflect the structure and sign of ph excitations introduced as the model space increases.

Data for the 6 Li C2 transition\nhave been measured to q \u2248 3.5 fm\u22121 [12, 13, 14]. Extensive data are also available for the 4.44 MeV (2+ ) state\nin 12 C [17, 18, 19, 20].\nThe most significant contributions to the C2 form factors for p-shell nuclei in a (0 + 2)h\u0304\u03c9 calculation are\ntransitions within the p-shell (0p \u2192 0p) and ph excitations across two shells that correspond to the excitation of the GQR. The latter transform under SU(3) as\n(\u03bb, \u03bc)L = (2, 0)2.

At low momentum transfers the calculations under-predict the form factor. Above q \u2248 1.5 fm\u22121\nthe calculations over-predict the form factor, and this\nover-prediction becomes increasingly worse as the size of\nthe model space is increased. As the model space is increased beyond 0h\u0304\u03c9, the 0p \u2192 1p excitations add destructively at low q (and thus destructively to the the\nB(E2) value) and constructively at high q, moving the\nform factor out. The predicted form factor is enhanced\nslightly at small q relative to the 0h\u0304\u03c9 calculation, and we\nlargely attribute this to the 0s \u2192 1d excitations, which\nappear with the correct sign. We note this differs from\nthe elastic C0 form factors where excitations from the 0s\nshell appear with the same sign as excitations from the\n0p shell. It should be noted that the model spaces examined here are restricted to 6h\u0304\u03c9 and that much larger\nspaces may well show very different trends.\nFigure 8 displays C2(q), which we extracted from the\nmeasured form factor using b=1.7 fm. The experimental C2(q) matrix element steadily drops with increasing\nq 2 . Our multi-h\u0304\u03c9 calculations predict C2(q) to have the\nopposite slope, in large part because of the sign of the\n(0p)\u22121 (1p) excitations in the 0+ and 2+ wave functions.\nFigure 9 displays the corresponding transition charge\ndensity \u03c1(r) for the 0+ \u2192 2+ transition.

However, our ability to go to\nconsiderably higher shells in the case of 6 Li allows us to\nexplore these trends in more detail. The peak of the predicted form factor occurs at higher q than experiment;\nthe biggest shift of the predicted form factor away from\nthe observed peak occurs between the 0h\u0304\u03c9 and the 2h\u0304\u03c9\nmodel space, and a shift in the peak position to even\nhigher q continues until 8h\u0304\u03c9. Above 8h\u0304\u03c9 the peak position of the form factor begins to improve. Above the\npeak, at momenta q > 1.3 fm\u22121 , the additional contributions from higher shell continue to enhance the form\nfactor. For low momentum transfers (below the peak of\nthe form factor) we see a slow convergence to a magnitude lower than experiment. This low momentum trend\nis consistent with the trend of predicted B(E2) values, as\nsummarized in Table III.\nWe also examined the form factor for a set of calculations with a different oscillator parameter, namely, b\n= 1.94 fm (h\u0304\u03c9 = 11 MeV), Figure 11. The b = 1.94 fm\nform factors display similar qualitative behavior as the b\n= 1.79 fm calculations. The peak of the former occurs at\nhigher q than experiment and continues to shift outward\nuntil about 10h\u0304\u03c9. For large model spaces the situation\nstarts to improve. Above the peak of the form factor the\n\nhigher shell contributions move the form factor further\nout in q with increasing model space.\nThe enhancements for the form factors at large q are\ndetermined by the sign and magnitude of the higher shell\ncontributions in the wave functions. As in the case of 12 C,\nthis is most striking in the case of the 2h\u0304\u03c9 configurations,\nwhere the 0p \u2192 1p0f ph excitations add destructively at\nlow q and constructively at high q. The slow convergence\nof the B(E2) to a value smaller than experiment is due\nin large part to the fact that these ph excitations add\ndestructively to the matrix element.\nA more detailed understanding of the convergence of\nthe lower momentum terms in the form factor with increasing model space can be seen by examining the C2\nmatrix element. To obtain an experimental C2 matrix\nelement, we chose an oscillator parameter b = 1.70 fm,\nwhich is close to the value necessary to give the measured\nrms charge radius. The C2 calculated matrix elements\nare displayed in Figures 12 and 13. The experimental\nC2 matrix element decreases with increasing momentum\ntransfer in contrast to the predictions of the model.\n\nWe graph the ratio of the coefficients B/A appearing\nin eq. 6 in Figure 14 as a function of basis size. For the\nsmaller model spaces this ratio has the wrong sign, but\nas the model space increases the sign eventually changes\nin qualitative agreement with experiment. For b = 1.79\nfm, the ratio changes sign between 4h\u0304\u03c9 and 6h\u0304\u03c9 model\nspaces; for the b = 1.94 fm, the sign switches between\n8h\u0304\u03c9 and 10h\u0304\u03c9.\n\nExcept for the largest model space examined, we see\nan approximate linear relationship between basis size and\n\n\f7\n0h\u03c9\n2h\u03c9\n6h\u03c9\n10h\u03c9\n14h\u03c9\n\n2\n\nC2 matrix element (e fm )\n\n6\n\n5\n\n0\n\n10\n\n4\n\n4h\u03c9 CD Bonn\n4h\u03c9 NFA\n6h\u03c9 CD Bonn\n6h\u03c9 NFA\n\n-1\n\n10\n\n2\n\nFL (q)\n\n3\n\n2\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n2\ny = (bq/2)\n\n3\n\n-2\n\n10\n\n4\n-3\n\n10\n\nFIG. 13: (Color online) The C2 matrix element with b = 1.94\nfm.

In addition, the magnetic form factor for the\n0+ \u2192 1+ transition in 12 C is significantly improved when\na 3-body interaction is included [6]. This is because the\npredicted form factor is very sensitive to the strength of\nthe spin-orbit interaction. However, the present (\u2206L = \u03bb\n\u2206S = 0) C\u03bb charge form factors are largely insensitive\nto the strength of the spin-orbit interaction and consequently to the 3-body interaction. In Figure 16 we compare the predicted 4h\u0304\u03c9 and 6h\u0304\u03c9 predictions for the elastic\nC0 form factor for 6 Li.

When HO standard shell\nmodel calculations are extended to include multi-h\u0304\u03c9 configurations the lack of self-consistency (in the HartreeFock sense) causes some of the higher shell components\nin the wave functions to be unphysical [26, 27, 28, 29, 30,\n\n\f8\n\n4h\u03c9 CD Bonn\n4h\u03c9 NFA\n6h\u03c9 CD Bonn\n6h\u03c9 NFA\n\n-2\n\n-2\n\n1.66 fm\n1.72 fm\n1.79 fm\n1.94 fm\n\n10\n\n2\n\nFL (q)\n\n10\n\n-3\n\n-3\n\nF L(q)\n\n10\n\n2\n\n10\n\n-4\n\n10 0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n-4\n\n3\n\n10\n\n-1\n\nq (fm )\n\n0\n\n2\n\nC2 Matrix Element (e fm )\n\n6\n\n5\n\n2\n-1\nq (fm )\n\n3\n\n4\n\n1\n\n2\n2\ny = (bq/2)\n\n3\n\n4\n\n2\n\nC2 matrix element (e fm )\n\n5\n4\n\n3\n\n2\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n2\n\ny = (bq/2)\n\nFIG. 17: (color online) Comparison of the predicted C2 form\nfactor for the 3+ state of 6 Li with and without the inclusion\nof a 3-body interaction.\n\n31, 32, 33]. The main problem arises because matrix elements of the kinetic energy (T ) and the two-body interaction (V ) across two shells (\u2206h\u0304\u03c9 = 2) are large and opposite in sign, and they cannot be calculated reliably. The\ndependence of the C2 matrix element on b implies that\nthe magnitude and even the sign of the hph|T + V |0h\u0304\u03c9i\nmatrix elements depend on b. These off-diagonal matrix\nelements across two shells in turn affect the sign of the\nleading ph excitations in the wave functions, as well as\nall of the similar \u2206h\u0304\u03c9 = 2 matrix elements up to the\nmaximum shell included in the calculation.\n\nA.\n\n1\n\nDependence of 6 Li Form factors on the\nOscillator Parameter\n\nWe investigated the effect of the oscillator parameter\non the predicted form factor within the 2h\u0304\u03c9 model space,\nusing four different values of b ranging from b = 1.66 1.94 fm (h\u0304\u03c9 = 15-11 MeV), as shown in Figure 18. As b\nvaries so does the predicted shape of the form factor: the\nwidth of the peak becomes narrower, and the peak itself\nshifts to lower momentum values with increasing b. The\nchange in slope of the C2 matrix element with b (Figure\n18b) suggests that for sufficiently small b, the slope of the\nC2 matrix element will become negative, qualitatively\nagreeing with experiment. But such a small value of b\nwould would likely result in very slow convergence of the\n\n4\n3\n2\n1\n0\n\n0\n\nFIG. 18: (Color online) The charge form factor and the C2\nmatrix element for 6 Li are calculated for several values of b in\nthe 2h\u0304\u03c9 model space.\n\ncalculations.\n\nB.\n\nDependence of the 12 C Form Factor on the\nOscillator Parameter\n\nIn Figure 19 we display the dependence of the predicted C2 matrix element in 12 C on the oscillator parameter. These calculations were restricted to a (0 + 2)h\u0304\u03c9\nmodel space. As the oscillator parameter is varied,\nthe value of hph | T + V | 0h\u0304\u03c9i changes considerably and eventually changes signs. For sufficiently small\nb(< 1.33f m) the slope of C2(q) becomes negative, in\nqualitative agreement with experiment.\n\nC.\n\nDependence of the Giant Resonances on the\nOscillator Parameter\n\nHoshino et al. [32] have pointed out that the problem\nwith the sign of matrix elements of hT + V i in multih\u0304\u03c9 shell model calculations also manifests itself in the\n\n\f9\n\nFIG. 19: (color online) Dependence of the C2 matrix element\nfor the 4.44 MeV state in 12 C on the oscillator parameter for\nthe (0 + 2)h\u0304\u03c9 model space.\n\npredicted excitation of the GQR and GMR. The excitation energy of the GMR reflects the compressibility of\nthe nucleus. Both are intrinsic properties of the nucleonnucleon interaction; and, the excitation energy should\nnot depend on the properties of the HO well. In Figure\n20 we show the predicted E0 strength for two different\nvalues of the oscillator parameter for our (0+2)h\u0304\u03c9 model\nspace. The large shift in the predicted excitation of the\nGMR from \u2248 35 MeV to \u2248 60 MeV occurs because of the\nchange in the off-diagonal hph | T + V | 0h\u0304\u03c9i matrix elements for the two values of the oscillator parameter. An\nanalogous problem is seen with the E2 strength, Figure\n21. We note that the sensitivity of the excitation energy of the giant resonances to the oscillator parameter\nwould likely be considerably less for larger model spaces.\nBut our (0 + 2)h\u0304\u03c9 model space calculations exhibit similar sensitivity to that seen by Hoshino et al. [32]. As\nin the case of the (e, e\u2032 ) form factors, the problem can\nbe directly traced to the \u2206h\u0304\u03c9 = 2, (\u03bb, \u03bc) = (2, 0) ph\nexcitations.\n\nFIG. 20: Dependence of the predicted Giant Monopole\nStrength (B(E0)) in 12 C on the oscillator parameter for the\n(0 + 2)h\u0304\u03c9 model space.\n\nFIG. 21: Dependence of the T=0 E2 strength built on the\nground state of 12 C on the oscillator parameter for the (0 +\n2)h\u0304\u03c9 model space.\n\nVI.\nD.\n\nEffect of an effective two-body electron\nscattering operator\n\nSince the model space sizes discussed here are finite, it\nis important to address the issue of the impact of effective\n(e, e\u2032 ) operators and whether they can correct for the sign\nof the \u2206h\u0304\u03c9 = 2 ph excitations in the wave functions.\nStetcu et al.[34] investigated how a two-body effective\ncontribution affects the E2 and C2 operators. In the 0h\u0304\u03c9\nspace, they found that the two-body operator moves the\nform factor in the same direction as the larger (0+2)h\u0304\u03c9\ncalculations move; that is, the two-body operator results\nin the same unphysical enhancement of the form factor\nat large q.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nWe have calculated the elastic C0 and the first excited\nstate C2 charge form factors and the corresponding C2\nmatrix elements in 6 Li and 12 C within the NCSM using\none-body bare operators. These calculations reveal two\nprimary findings. First, the magnitude and sign of higher\nshell ph amplitudes in the wavefunction do not behave as\nexpected. Higher shell contributions add destructively\nat low q and constructively at high q to the form factors, contrary to experimental and theoretical expectations. The relative sign of the symplectic (\u03bb, \u03bc) = (2, 0),\n\u2206h\u0304\u03c9 = 2 amplitudes cause them to add destructively to\nthe charge radii. The large 0s \u2192 ns (and 0p \u2192 np for\n12\nC) amplitudes, introduced by the Lee-Suzuki transfor-\n\n\f10\nmation, also affect the shape of the form factors, further increasing the magnitude of the form factors at high\nmomentum transfers. In the larger model spaces we explored for 6 Li, the sign of the 2h\u0304\u03c9 contributions to the\ninelastic form factor changes, but convergence onto experiment is slow.\nThe second main finding is the strong dependence of\nthe magnitude and sign of the off diagonal \u2206h\u0304\u03c9 = 2 matrix elements of T + V on the oscillator parameter. As a\nresult, the observables (the C2 form factor, GMR, GQR)\nalso heavily depend on the choice of oscillator parameter.\nFurthermore, the ph configurations in the low lying wave\nfunctions appear with an unexpected sign. These results\nindicates a lack of self-consistency in the NCSM similar\nto that found in the standard HO shell model. While\nthere is no known solution, the effects may be minimized\nby including a Hartree-Fock condition in the calculations\nA prescription [28, 32] used in HO shell model calculations is to invoke the following condition:\nh(n + 2)h\u0304\u03c9 ph | T + V | nh\u0304\u03c9i(\u03bb,\u03bc)=(2,0) = 0\n\n(7)\n\n[1] P.

But in\nany case a correct treatment of the symplectic terms in\nthe wave functions is crucial to obtaining a realistic description of electron scattering form factors within a HO\nshell model basis [35]. Invoking eq. (7) and/or another\nprescription to handle the \u2206h\u0304\u03c9 = 2 and higher ph excitations may lead the NCSM to have as much success in\npredicting momentum-based observables as in predicting\nenergy spectra.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nWe wish to thank Petr Navr\u00e1til for providing us with the\nNCSM one-body density matrix elements used in these\nstudies, and for many detailed and valuable discussions.\nWe also wish to thank Ingo Sick, Gerry Peterson and Hall\nCrannell for providing us with their unpublished electron\nscattering data.\n\n[17] H.
