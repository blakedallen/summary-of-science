While\nthe theories decribing the classical and quantum objects\nare well established, the border between the two still remains hazy for many. There have been many attempts\ntowards resolving this issue. Most of them either modify\nquantum mechanics, e.g., the so called GRW proposal [1],\nor introduce certain hidden variables, e.g., the deBroglieBohm approach.\nOne approach which tries to tackle the problem using only conventional quantum mechanics forms the basis of the decoherence program, initiated by Zeh [2], and\nlater extensively developed by Zurek and collaborators\n[3]. Decoherence approach is based on the observation\nthat macroscopic objects can never be considered approximately isolated. They are always interacting weakly\nwith various external degrees of freedom, collectively referred to as the environment, which are normally ignored.\nThe interaction with the environment leads to, argues\nZeh, a dephasing of the system. This leads to certain\nphase relations between the macroscopically separated\nparts of the wave-function, getting lost. This information is not really lost, but leaks away almost irreversibly\ninto the infinitely large number of degrees of freedom of\nthe environment. The result is that the initial pure state\ndensity matrix of the system now appears to be a mixed\nstate density matrix, if one decides not to look at the\nenvironment variables, and focuses attention only on the\nsystem of interest. It should be noted that while the time\nevolution of the system plus environment is completely\nunitary, the system by itself appears to undergo a nonunitary change. This process leads to the appearance of\na classically interpretable probability distribution, and is\nbelieved to describe the emergence of the classical world.\nA prototype model that one studies in this context\nis that of a free particle coupled to a \"heat-bath\" of an\ninfinite number of independent harmonic oscillators[4\u20136].\nThis model becomes tractable in the so-called Markovian\napproximation. In this limit the time evolution of the\n\n\u2217 Email:\n\ntabish@ctp-jamia.res.in\n\ndensity matrix is governed by a master equation. Zurek\ndid an approximate study of this master equation and\nshowed that quantum coherence between two pieces of\nthe wave-function, spatially separated by a distance \u2206x,\nis destroyed over a time-scale given by\n\u03c4D \u2248 \u03b3 \u22121\n\nh\u03042\n,\n2mkB T (\u2206x)2\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03b3 \u22121 is the relaxation time of the system, kB T is\nthe thermal energy of the heat-bath, assumed to be in\nequilibrium, and m is the mass of the particle. As one\ncan see, for a particle of mass 1g, interacting with a heatbath at 300K, the quantum coherence over a distance\nof 1cm is destroyed in a time which is 10\u221240 times the\nrelaxation time.\nZurek also concluded from this analysis that the environment selects position as a preferred basis in which\nthe density matrix of the particle becomes diagonal. The\nstates constituting this basis, selected by environment induced decoherence, have come to be known as preferred\nstates or pointer states. The nature of pointer states has\nalso been a subject of much research attention [8, 9].\nRecently, related models have been studied in a more\nrigorous manner to understand the detailed working\nof decoherence[10\u201313]. Interestingly, the conclusions of\nthese studies are at variance with Zurek's approximate\ncalculation.\nThe purpose of this investigation is to have a fresh\nlook at one model and get a clear picture regarding the\ndecoherence time and pointer states.\n\nII.\n\nWHAT TO EXPECT?\n\nLet us first discuss what one should expect as a result of\ndecoherence, if one believes that it leads to the emergence\nof classicality. We should of course expect that there will\nbe no Schr\u00f6dinger's cats hanging around, that is, there\nshould be no superpositions of spatially separated states.\nZurek's analysis achieves that as he shows that quantum coherence over macroscopic distances dies out very\nvery fast. But that alone doesn't rule out the existence\nof superpositions of macrosopically distinct momentum.\n\n\f2\nClassically we should also anticipate that quantum coherence will be destroyed over macroscopic distances in\nthe momentum space too. Then classical particles will\nhave macroscopically well-defined position, as well as momentum, and their dynamics could be characterized by\npaths. Infact, macroscopic superpositions of no classical\nobservable should exist. Such should be the nature of the\npointer states that emerge. In this light, Zurek's claim\nof position emerging as the preferred basis[7] and that\nof some other works[10\u201312] where momentum seems to\nemerge as pointer states, do not seem to satisfy the criterion of \"classicality\". On the other hand, in the work of\nZurek and Paz[15] and also of Venugopalan [13] coherent\nstates seem to emerge as pointer states for a harmonic\noscillator, which nicely satisfy the \"classicality\" criterion.\nWe should also expect that full classical dynamics will\nemerge from decoherence, which means that the effect\nof interaction with the environment will have negligibly\nsmall influence on the dynamics. It is worth pointing out\nthat the same models have been in use for studying quantum dissipation [5, 6], where one studies the influence of\na heat-bath on the dynamics of a quantum system. Since\nwe are assuming that our system of interest is classically\nan isolated system, no dissipative effect should be observable even if decoherence is strong. This seems like a\nstringent condition, but it will turn out that this is not\nso.\nAnother thing one might expect is that decoherence\nwould be faster if the interaction with the environment\nis stronger. Zurek's expression for decoherence time\n2\n\u03c4D \u2248 \u03b3 \u22121 2mkBh\u0304T (\u2206x)2 seems to be in agreement with this\nline of thought. The decoherence time here is inversely\nproportional to \u03b3, which is also a measure of the strength\nof interaction with the environment.\n\nIII.\n\nTHE STERN-GERLACH SETUP\n\nIn the following, we look at a model, which has already been studied before, and try to understand how\ndecoherence works.\nConsider a particle of mass m and spin 12 , moving\nalong the y-axis, and passing through a magnetic field\nalong the z-axis, which is inhomogeneous along the xaxis. This model typically describes a Stern-Gerlach experiment, with a Hamiltonian\nH0 =\n\np2\n+ \u01ebx\u03c3z ,\n2m\n\n(2)\n\nwhere x and p denote the position and momentum operators of the particle, and \u03c3z is the Pauli spin matrix,\ndenoting the z-component of the spin operator, multiplied by 2.\nIn addition, the particle is assumed to interact with\na set of infinite number of harmonic oscillators, through\n\nthe interaction\nX Pj2\n1\n+ mj wj2\nHI =\n2m\n2\nj\nj\n\ngj x\nXj \u2212\nmj \u03c9j2\n\n!2\n\n,\n\n(3)\n\nwhich is just the Hamiltonian for a set of independent but\nshifted harmonic oscillators, with the shift proportional\nto the position of the particle. This in effect, represents\na coordinate-coordinate coupling of the particle with the\noscillators, with gj as coupling constants. The aim is\nto study the reduced density matrix of the system by\ntracing over the oscillator degrees of freedom. The offdiagonal matrix elements represent presence of quantum\ncoherence in the system.\nIt turns out that in order to analyze the influence of\nthe environment consisting of harmonic oscillators on the\ndynamics of the particle, one does not need individual\nknowledge of gj s, mj s and \u03c9j s. One only requires them in\na particular combination as they appear in the so-called\nspectral density function :\n\nJ(\u03c9) =\n\n\u221e\nX\ngj2\n\u03b4(\u03c9 \u2212 \u03c9j ).\nmj \u03c9 j\nj=0\n\n(4)\n\nIn order to describe the dissipative behavior that goes\nto the correct classical limit, one assumes a continuous\nspectrum of frequencies in the bath, with the spectral\ndensity taking the \"Ohmic\" form where J(\u03c9) is linear in\n\u03c9 for small frequencies:\nJ(\u03c9) = \u03b3\u03c9e\u2212\u03c9/\u03c9c ,\n\n(5)\n\nwhere \u03c9c is a large cut-off frequency.\nClearly, \u03b3 is now a measure of the strength of the coupling between the particle and the environment. All the\ngj s going to zero would amount to \u03b3 going to zero, which\nwould represent a decoupled system and heat-bath.\nThis model has been studied before by the pathintegral technique [10] and the master equation technique\n[11]. In both the works, the conclusion is that the offdiagonal elements (in the spin-space) of the density matrix decay over a time-scale\nts =\n\n\u0012\n\n3h\u03042 m\u03b3\n2\u01eb2 kB T\n\n\u00131/3\n\n.\n\n(6)\n\nIt is also concluded that the spin-diagonal components\nof the density matrix become diagonal in the momentum\nspace over a decoherence time-scale\n\u03c4D =\n\nm\u03b3\n,\n2kB T (\u2206p)2\n\n(7)\n\nwhere \u2206p is the spread in the momentum space.\nLet us look at the the reduced density matrix for the\nparticle more carefully. For simplicity, let us assume that\nthe particle started as a Gaussian wave-packet of width\n\u03c3, with mean momentum zero, meaning the particle has\n\n\f3\nno motion along x-axis when it travels along y-axis. The\nspin diagonal elements of the reduced density matrix can\nbe written as [11]\n\u03c1\u00b1 (R, r, t) = 2\n\nr\n\n\u0013\n\u001a \u0012 \u22122\u03c4\nD(1 \u2212 e\u22122\u03c4 ) 2\ne\n\u03c0\nr\n+\nexp \u2212\nM (\u03c4 )\n4\u03c3 2\n8h\u03042 \u03b3\n\ni\u01eb\n(1 \u2212 e\u2212\u03c4 )r\nh\u0304\u03b3\n\u0012\n1\n\u01eb\n\u2212\nR\u00b1\n(1 \u2212 e\u2212\u03c4 \u2212 \u03c4 )\nM (\u03c4 )\nm\u03b3 2\n\u2213\n\nof it, look like\n\u03c0\n2m\u03b3kB T (x \u2212 x\u2032 )2\nexp(\u2212\nt)\n2\n\u03c3\nh\u0304\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u01ebt2 2\n1\ni\u01ebxt\n\u2212 2 (x \u2213\n)\n\u00d7 exp \u2213\nh\u0304\n2\u03c3\n2m\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u2032\ni\u01ebx t\n\u01ebt2 2\n1\n\u00d7 exp \u00b1\n\u2212 2 (x\u2032 \u2213\n) .\nh\u0304\n2\u03c3\n2m\n(12)\n\n\u03c1\u00b1 (R, r, t) \u2248 2\n\nr\n\n\u00132 )Barring the exponential time-decay term, this represents\na pure state density matrix for a Gaussian wave-packet,\n,\n\u01ebt2\ncentered at x = \u00b1 2m\n, with a mean momentum p\u0304 = \u00b1\u01ebt.\nThis has a nice classical interpretation - with an accelera(8)\ntion \u01eb/m, after a time t, the particle would have travelled\n\u01ebt2\n\u2032\n, and would have acquired a momentum \u01ebt.\na distance 2m\nwhere \u03c4 = \u03b3t, D = 8m\u03b3kB T , r = x \u2212 x\u2032 , R = x+x\nand\n2\nThus one sees that although there is fast decoherence,\nthe classical dynamics remains intact.

This would mean,\nif the interaction with the environment, parametrized by\n\u03b3 is decreased, the decoherence should be faster. That\ncannot obviously be true. The catch lies in the fact\nthat in earlier works [10, 11], the authors used the limit\n\u03b3t \u226b 1, which takes one to the regime where there is not\njust decoherence, but also dissipation. Decoherence happens very fast, in the time within the limit \u03b3t \u226a 1. So,\nit is meaningful to use this limit to study decoherence.\nIn the limit \u03b3t \u226b 1 dissipative effects overshadow the\neffect of decoherence in the dynamics. This limit is physically meaningful in studying the damped dynamics of\nquantum particles. The particle moving under a potential, loses energy and ultimately thermalizes with the\nheat-bath, ending in a meandering trajectory. For example, a quantum harmonic oscillator, in this limit would be\ndamped to the extent that it comes to its mean position\nand executes thermal motion.\nIt should be pointed out that if pointer states were\neither momentum states as claimed in [10, 11], or position\nstates as claimed by Zurek [7], the density matrix would\nremain non-diagonal in the conjugate variable, and the\nclassicality criteria won't be satisfied. In our analysis,\nGaussian states with moving centers, emerge as natural\npointer states. They look closer to classical states, and\nalso yield undamped Newtonian dynamics.\n\nBarring the first term, the rest of the expression represents a pure state density matrix for a momentum wavepacket, centered at p = \u00b1\u01ebt, and with a mean position\n\u01ebt2\n. This again has a nice classical interpretation of\n\u00b1 2m\n\u01ebt2\na particle having travelled a distance \u00b1 2m\n, and having\nacquired a momentum \u00b1\u01ebt, because of an acceleration\n\u00b1\u01eb/m due to the Stern-Gerlach field.\nThus the environment selects out Gaussian wavepackets approximately localized both in position and momentum, as pointer states. So, the \"classicality\" criterion, discussed in section II is satisfied here. This result\nis in agreement with the earlier work by Eisert where it is\nshown that decoherence to Gaussian states is generic for\nfree particles coupled to heat-bath [16]. Here we see that\neven for the Stern-Gerlach setup, Gaussian states emerge\nas pointer states, although with a centre that moves according to classical dynamics. So, the undamped Newtonian dynamics is recovered. Thus, the role of the environment is only to localize spatially extended states. The\nNewtonain dynamics, which is guaranteed by the Ehrenfest theorem, emerges naturally. With (approximately)\nwell-defined position and momentum, one can now talk\nof classical paths. So, because of decoherence, quantum\nparticles acquire trajectories.\nEarlier works [10, 11] conclude that the pointer states\nfor this problem are momentum states, and the decoherence time is given by (7). Expression (7) cannot denote\nthe true decoherence time, because it depends inversely\n\nIn this paper, we have clarified certain issues regarding\nthe time-scales over which environment-induced decoherence occurs, and the nature of emergent pointer states. A\nmodel system, namely, the Stern-Gerlach setup, coupled\nto a quantum mechanical \"heat-bath\" has been studied.\nThe emergent pointer states are Gaussian states which\nevolve following Newtonian dynamics.\n\n[1] G.
