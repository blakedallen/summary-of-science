Introduction\nBand edge effects and resonant phenomena in\nmagnetophotonic crystals are of interest because of\ntheir influence on polarization and speed of light control,\nof significant import in signal processing. Such\nstructures may lead to magnetically tunable optical\ndelay lines and optical buffers for signal routing or data\nstorage.\nThe study of photonic crystal effects in magnetic\nmaterials has developed rapidly in the last few years\nand interest in this field continues to grow 1)-15). The\npresent\nwork\naddresses\nthe\ndevelopment\nof\nmagnetophotonic crystals in optical waveguide\ngeometries. On-chip waveguide devices are appealing\nfor a number of reasons besides the natural allure of\nmonolithic integration. Of particular note is the\npossibility of attaining high index contrast in the\nphotonic crystal through patterning of air gaps in the\nplane of the film and the enhancement of the coupling\nstrength through high-order mode backscattering.6)-8),16)\n\n30kV gallium ions are used to pattern the photonic\nbandgap structure with period 338nm in length.\nLinear-birefringence in the slab is measured at 0.0006,\n0.0046, and 0.0106 for the first three waveguide modes,\nfrom fundamental to second order, respectively.\n200-\u03bcm-long gratings are formed on waveguide\nridges to a specification of 600nm-deep grooves.\n6\u03bcm-wide 800nm-high ridges fabricated by standard\nphotolithography and dry-etching form the optical\nchannels. Overall ridge waveguide lengths are 1.18\nmm. Figure 1 shows a scanning-electron micrograph of\nthe patterned photonic crystal ridge and a\nseven-quarter wave phase-shift resonant cavity step.\nThe gratings are placed 20 \u03bcm away from the input\nfacets to minimize polarization and birefringence effects\nfrom the waveguide segment before the light couples\ninto the photonic crystal.\n\n2. Polarization in magnetophotonic waveguides\nand band edge effects\nIn this article we present a study of band edge\nphenomena in ridge waveguide magnetophotonic\ncrystals as they relate to the manipulation of optical\nphases and speeds. Normal mode analysis is used to\nunderstand the effect of near-band edge group velocity\non the polarization. Large polarization departures\nfrom the input are observed and their relation to normal\nmode speed modifications is addressed. Bragg gratings\npatterned by focused-ion-beam milling on 2.86-\u03bcm-thick\nliquid-phase-epitaxial (LPE) (Bi,Lu)(2.8 \u00b1 0.1)Fe(4.6 \u00b1\n0.2)O(12.4 \u00b1 0.3) films on (111) gadolinium gallium garnet\n(GGG) substrates constitute the photonic crystals.\n\nFig.\n1\nScanning\nelectron\nmicrograph\nof\nmagnetophotonic crystal on ridge waveguide\nchannel. The image shows a portion of the\ngrating containing the seven-quarter wave\nphase-shift step at the center of the structure.\n\n\fFig. 2 Transmittance and polarization rotation for\none-dimensional magnetophotonic crystal on\nridge waveguide with a single phase-shift step.\nDifferent stop bands correspond to backscatter\ncoupling to fundamental through second-order\nwaveguide modes.\nLinearly\npolarized\nlight\nfrom a tunable\n1480-1580nm wavelength laser source is coupled into\nthe waveguide by end-fire fiber coupling through a\nlensed fiber. Detection takes place by imaging the\noutput signal into a photodetector through a 10\u00d7\nmicroscope objective. A saturating 50 Oe magnetic\nfield is applied collinear to the waveguide axis and\nmeasurements are taken for parallel and anti-parallel\ndirections of the field to the propagation direction.12),13)\nThe polarization direction is defined as the direction of\nthe semi-major axis of the ellipse, and the polarization\nrotation angle as half the difference between the output\npolarization directions corresponding to both magnetic\nfields. Insertion losses are estimated at 6dB.\nFigure 2 displays the transmitted intensity and the\ndirection of the semi-major axis of the output\npolarization ellipse relative to the input linear\npolarization direction for transverse electric (TE) input.\nThree stop bands are visible in these samples. Of\nparticular interest here are the large departures from\ninput polarization near the band edges in the short\nwavelength side of the spectral range. Figure 3 shows\nthe transmittance and polarization rotation for\nfirst-order mode backscattering in a photonic crystal\nwithout phase shift step (Bragg grating) fabricated on\nthe same garnet film under the same conditions\ndescribed above. Also re-plotted for comparison (Fig.\n3(a)) is the corresponding polarization rotation for\nfirst-order mode backscattering from Fig. 2. The large\ndepartures in polarization rotation near the band edge\nin Fig. 3(b) show that the polarization changes exist\neven in the absence of a resonant cavity. Thus group\nvelocity variations and not solely photon trapping in a\ncavity (in the sense of standing waves) are responsible\nfor the observed excursions in polarization. Differential\nvariations in group velocity between the right- and\nleft-elliptically polarized components of the propagating\n\nFig. 3\nPolarization rotation for backscattercoupling to the first-order waveguide mode for\none-dimensional magnetophotonic crystals with\n(a) and without (b) phase-shift steps. More than\n90% of the forward propagating power is in the\nfundamental mode. The polarization rotation\nenhancement in case (b) shows that there is a\nchange in group velocity as a result of the\nphotonic bandgap structure.\nbeam as a result of the resonant splitting between their\nrespective bands and the shape of the band structure\nnear the band edge can lead to additional output phase\ndifferences between them and increased polarization\nrotations. The spectral location of the polarization\nrotation peaks in Fig. 3(b) may be affected by the spread\nin the band edges.\nThe stop band multiplicity in these photonic\ncrystals evident in Fig. 2 is the result of inter-modal\ncoupling\nbetween\nforward\nfundamental\nmode\npropagation\nand\nbackscattering\nto\nhigh-order\nwaveguide modes by the Bragg grating. Each of the stop\nbands visible in Fig. 2 results from Bragg scattering\nunder the condition \u03bb = \u039b (nf + nb). Here \u03bb is the\noptical wavelength in vacuum, \u039b the grating period, and\nnf and nb are the modal effective indices of the forward\nand backward propagating beams, respectively. We\nstress that the effect under discussion is not high-order\nBragg scattering which occurs well outside the optical\nwavelength range under study but inter-modal coupling\nbetween different waveguide modes. Of especial interest\nis the strong coupling and large rotations that occur for\nfundamental forward to high-order backscattered modes\nin Fig. 2 and Fig. 3. These effects stem from an\nenhancement in the grating coupling strength for\nhigh-order mode backscattering.16)\n\n\ftan 2\u03b8 =\n\n2x 0 y 0\nx 02 \u2212 y 02\n\ncos \u03c6\n\n(2)\n\nHere \u03c6 is the phase difference between the y and\nx-components of the polarization, and x0, y0 are the\nmagnitudes of the electric field vectors in the x- and\ny-directions. The latter can be measured with the help\nof a polarization analyzer at the output end. Thus x0, y0,\nand \u03b8 are directly measurable quantities. The phase\ndifference between the outgoing elliptical normal modes\n\u2206\u03b6 = \u03b6+ \u2212 \u03b6\u2212 is related to the polarization rotation\nthrough the following expression:15)\n\nFig. 4 Phase-angle difference \u2206\u03b6 between normal\nmodes for an optical channel without phase\nshift step. The black circles are computed from\nthe polarization-rotation and transmittance\ndata. A curve computed via transfer-matrix\nsimulation is also plotted for comparison. The\ntransmittance is shown for reference.\n\n3. Normal mode analysis\n3.1 Measured polarization rotation, phase\nretardation and normal modes\nThe large changes in polarization direction in the\nstop bands noted above can be understood in terms of\naccrued phase differences between normal modes in the\noptical guide. This, of course, is also the origin of the\nFaraday rotation in bulk magneto-optic systems, where\nthe normal modes of propagation are circularly\npolarized waves with opposite sense of rotation\ntraveling at different speeds. For magnetophotonic\noptical waveguide channels the normal modes become\nelliptically-polarized waves having opposite sense of\nrotation.15)\nThe ratio between semi-major and semi-minor\ncomponents in the magnetophotonic crystal normal\nmodes is:15)\n\uf8eb (n) \uf8f6\n\u03b1\n\uf8ecEx \uf8f7\n(1)\n\uf8ec (n) \uf8f7 = i\n\uf8ecEy \uf8f7\n\u03b2\n\u03b22\n2\n\uf8ed\n\uf8f8\u00b1\n\u00b1 \u03b1 +\n2\n4\nIn the above expression \u03b1 is the Faraday rotation\nper unit length for the medium in question and \u03b2 is the\nlinear birefringence retardation per unit length 2\u03c0(ny \u2013\nThis linear birefringence depends on the\nnx)/\u03bb.\neffective indices of the TE and TM modes in the\nwaveguide.

Good agreement\nis seen with the experimental data.7), 8), 15) The transfer\nmatrix formulation is discussed in section 3.2, below.\nIt should be noted that one can reconstruct the\npolarization rotation angle \u03b8 from the normal-mode\ntransmittance-phases \u03b6+ and \u03b6\u2212.15) Figure 5 shows the\ncalculated rotation angle for the first-order mode\nbackscattering under examination.\nVery good\nagreement is obtained with the measured polarization\nrotation in Fig. 3 for both cases, with and without phase\nshift step. However, it is clear that the relation between\nthe normal-mode phase difference \u2206\u03b6 and the resulting\npolarization rotation is no longer a linear relation as\nwas the case for a birefringence-free system (Eq. (6)).\nAn analysis of the kind presented in this section is\nrequired.\n\n3.2 Elliptical normal-mode phases and group\nvelocities\nIn examining the accumulated phases and the\nspeed of propagation of the optical waves in the\nmagnetophotonic crystals under study it is important to\nconsider the normal modes separately.

In section 3.1 we analyzed the relation\nbetween normal mode phase differences and\npolarization rotation.\nWe also verified that the\nanalysis reproduces the measured polarization rotation\nin the stop bands. In this section we elaborate on the\ntransfer matrix model and proceed to evaluate the\nspectral dependence of the speed and phase for each of\nthe normal modes using this model.\nIn the transfer-matrix formulation the crystal is\ntreated as a layered structure composed of quarter-wave\nthick plates.7),8) The dielectric-tensor diagonal elements\ncontrol the waveguide mode birefringence.\nIndex\ncontrast is modeled through the relative strength of the\ndiagonal elements in adjacent layers, but keeping the\noverall birefringence uniform throughout the crystal\nalong the propagation direction. This is a good\napproximation for the waveguides under study.\nThe transfer matrix method relates the amplitudes\nfor forward (Axf , Ayf) and backwards (Axb , Ayb)\npropagating waves at the front (z = 0) and rear (z = L) of\nthe stack by a matrix relation A(L) = M A(0). Here A =\n(Axf , Ayf , Axb , Ayb ) and M is a 4 x 4 matrix given by the\nproduct Pn Tn, n-1 Pn-1 ... T2, 1 P1, where Pi propagates\nthe amplitude across medium i, and Ti, i -1 relates the\namplitudes across the interfaces between consecutive\nlayers by imposing continuity of the fields from one\nregion to the next.7),8) Each quarter-wave plate has a\nthickness h,\n\n\u03bb\n\n0\n,\n(7)\n\uf8eb \u03b5 xx + \u03b5\n\uf8f6\nyy \uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n4\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n2\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ed\n\uf8f8\nwhere \u03bb0 is the stop band center-wavelength, and \u03b5xx and\n\u03b5yy are the diagonal components of the dielectric tensor.\nThe following dielectric tensors are used herein for the\nalternating layers, denoted A and B, to simulate the\nmagnetophotonic crystal shown in Fig. 1:\nA\n\uf8eb \u03b5 A = 5 .285\n= 0 . 0027 i\n\u03b5 xy\n0 \uf8f6\uf8f7\n\uf8ec xx\n\uf8ec \u03b5 A = \u22120 .0027 i\nA\n= 5 . 268\n\u03b5 yy\n0 \uf8f7\uf8f7\n(8)\n\uf8ec yx\nA\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\n0\n0\n\u03b5 zz\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ed\n\uf8f8\n\nh =\n\nB\n\uf8eb \u03b5 B = 5 . 242\n= 0 .0027 i\n\u03b5 xy\n0 \uf8f6\uf8f7\n\uf8ec xx\n\uf8ec \u03b5 B = \u22120 . 0027 i\nB\n(9)\n\u03b5 yy = 5 . 225\n0 \uf8f7\uf8f7\n\uf8ec yx\nB \uf8f7\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\n0\n0\n\u03b5 zz \uf8f7\n\uf8ed\n\uf8f8\nOnce the equivalent layered structure has been\ndetermined this way, the normal mode characteristics,\nincluding normal mode output phases \u03b6\u00b1 are extracted\nfrom the model. The polarization rotations in Fig. 5,\ncomputed on the basis of this transfer-matrix approach\ncompare well with the experimental results and lend\nvalidity to the phases \u03b6\u00b1 extracted from these\ncalculations.\nBendickson et. al. have proposed a formulation for\nthe group velocity in a photonic crystal by defining an\neffective wave number k equal to \u03b6 d , where \u03b6 is the\ntotal accumulated phase as the light propagates\nthrough the structure and d is the physical thickness of\n\n\fthe same.17) The group velocity of a propagating wave is\nthen defined using the standard form\nd\u03c9\n(10)\nvg =\ndk\nIn terms of the accumulated phase \u03b6 the group\nvelocity is given by\nd\n(11)\nv g\u00b1 =\nd\u03b6 \u00b1\nd\u03c9\nHere we adopt the same definition of group velocity\nas in 17). Preliminary work in our research group\nindicates that this is a reasonable definition for a\nquarter-wave-plate stack photonic crystal, as long as the\nbirefringence is uniform across the whole stack. We\nintend to elaborate further on the physical\ninterpretation of the group velocity as defined here in a\nfuture publication.\nGroup velocities are calculated using the\ntransfer-matrix model. Normal modes as defined by Eq.\n1 are launched into the structure and their phases at\nthe output-end computed numerically.\nNumerical\ndifferentiation then yields the group velocities. We\npoint out that this transfer-matrix analysis also\nconfirms that the normal modes concerned emerge in\nthe same polarization state as the input except for an\noverall phase factor, as they should.\nFigure 6 displays the normal-mode group velocities\nof the photonic crystal without phase-shift step. The\nmodes resonate at different wavelengths because they\nhave different effective indices. Away from resonance\nthe group velocities show a rippled but otherwise flat\nresponse. Their value corresponds to c n , where n is\nthe average refractive index of the material. At the\nedges of each resonance the photons slow down\nto 0 . 6 c n . Notice that inside the stop band the photons\nspeed up significantly, reaching superluminal speeds\naccording to this calculation. A horizontal line\nat v c = 1 is drawn to show this.\nIt is expected that for the magnetophotonic crystal\n\nFig. 8 Calculated group velocities for the normal\nmodes in a magnetophotonic crystal ridge\nwaveguide with resonant cavity. Values are\nnormalized to c, the speed of light in vacuum.\ndepicted in Fig. 1 the phase-shift step will serve as a\nresonant cavity leading to the formation of standing\nwaves and an additional time delay. This kind of photon\ntrapping has often been cited as the origin of the\nenhanced Faraday rotation in magnetophotonic crystals.\nThe question is: how much of the enhancement is due to\nstanding-wave photon trapping and how much to actual\nchanges in group velocity?\nIn order to begin addressing this interesting question,\nwe have compared the accumulated phases of the\nnormal modes in (a) the magnetophotonic crystal with\nphase-shift step and (b) without phase-shift step. The\nphase differences are plotted in Fig. 7. Our expectation\nis that if there is a significant time delay due to photon\ntrapping there should be a significant phase difference\nnear the resonance wavelength given by the Bragg\ncondition. What we find is that although the phase\ndifference\nis\nnot\nzero\nat\nthe\nresonance\ncenter-wavelengths, it is nevertheless small. The\ncenter-wavelengths are 1541.45 nm (+) and 1538.83 nm\n(-). In both cases the phase difference is -15\u00b0 out of a\nmaximum 68\u00b0. We consider this as an indication that\nstanding-wave time delay is not the dominant effect\nhere.\nFurther investigation into this question is\nunderway.\n\nFigure 8 shows the calculated group velocities for both\nnormal modes for the magnetophotonic crystal with\nresonant cavity phase-shift step.\nA significant\nslow-down is noted at both center-wavelengths, with\nspeeds v c = 0 . 22 or v = 0 .5 c n .\n4.\nFig. 7 Normal mode difference in accumulated\nphase between propagation in the presence of a\nphase shift step and without a phase shift step.\nThe difference results from group velocity\ndifferences in the spectral dependence and time\ndelay engendered by photon tapping in the\nphase-shift-step resonant cavity.\n\nConclusions\n\nWe present a study of the polarization response and\nband edge effects in waveguide magnetophotonic\ncrystals fabricated on (Bi,Lu)(2.8 \u00b1 0.1)Fe(4.6 \u00b1 0.2)O(12.4 \u00b1 0.3)\nfilms on (111) gadolinium gallium garnet (GGG)\nsubstrates. Fundamental to first-order mode coupling in\nphotonic crystals with and without resonant cavity\n\n\fsteps is analyzed and compared. A formulation is\npresented that relates the polarization response to\nnormal\nmode\nphase\ndifferences\nin\nthese\nlinearly-birefringent polarization rotators. In contrast to\nthe Faraday Effect in non-birefringent systems a\nnon-linear relation exists between polarization rotations\nand normal mode phase differences. Transfer-matrix\nmodeling is used to extract the normal mode phase\nretardation in these magnetophotonic crystals. This\nanalysis yields evidence of optical slow-down at the\nBragg resonance center-wavelength for resonant cavity\nsteps to one-half the speed of light in the original\ndielectric medium. In contrast, significant speed-up is\nfound in the Bragg grating without phase-shift step.\n\nAcknowledgments This work was supported by the\nNational Science Foundation under grant ECS-0520814\nand the Department of Defense under grant DAAD\n17-03-C-0115.
