Pulsarlike stars are unique astro-laboratories to study matter at supranuclear density. On the\none hand, due to the mathematical complexity of the nonlinear nature of quantum chromodynamics (QCD), one believed to be the underlying theory for strong interaction, we can\nnot determine the state of supranuclear matter by first principles. Several speculations have\nto be presented in the literatures, including those currently focused state-of-the-art nuclear\nequations (normal neutron stars). Besides these conjectures, stable strange quark matter\n\n\f\u20132\u2013\nstate (quark stars) has been alternatively proposed since quark matter is a direct consequence\nof the \"asymptotic freedom\" which was found experimentally in 1960s and proved by QCD\nin 1973. On the other hand, recent observations show new members of the family of pulsarlike stars (e.g., anomalous X-ray pulsars/soft gamma-ray repeaters, central compact objects,\nand dim thermal neutron stars), whose different manifestations are not well understood and\ncould challenge the conventional scenario of normal neutron stars. In fact, neutron stars and\nquark stars should now be considered as two potential models equally possible for the nature\nof pulsar-like stars (see reviews e.g., Madsen 1999; Lattimer & Prakash 2004; Glendenning\n2000; Weber 2005; Xu 2006).\nHow do quark stars form? This is a question with bimodality of meaning. (i) It is\nstraightforward to know their births if one believes pulsars are actually quark stars. The\nastrophysics of phase conversion from nuclear matter to quark matter during, e.g., spindown\nor accretion stages is investigated at a preliminary step (Ouyed et al. 2002; Ker\u00e4nen et al.\n2005); but that quark star formation occurs simultaneously during the collapsing of massive\nstar's cores has not been treated previously, which will be focused in this paper. (ii) Could\ncore-collapse-produced quark stars result in successful supernovae? While supernovae keep\noccurring above the sky, the failure to simulate an explosion successfully in calculations\ntroubles astrophysicists over time. In reviewing the neutrino-driven explosion model, the\ncall for an alternative mechanism grew stronger (Mezzacappa 2005; Buras et al. 2003). Since\nstrange quark matter (SQM) could be the real ground state (Witten 1984), it is suggested\nthat SQM-formation may help to overcome the energy difficulty in getting type-II supernovae\nsuccessful, because more neutrinos should be radiated if phase-transition to SQM is included\n(Benvenuto & Horvath 1989; Lugones et al. 1994; Dai et al. 1995; See a review of Horvath\n2007).\nHowever, it should be emphasized that bare quark surfaces could be essential to successful explosions, for both \u03b3-ray bursts and core-collapse supernovae (Paczynski & Haensel\n2005; Xu 2005). The reason for that is simple and intuitive: due to the chromatic confinement, the photon luminosity of a quark surface is not limited by the Eddington limit.\nRegarding the ultra-high surface temperature of nascent strange stars (Haensel et al. 1991),\nwe believe that the strong radiation pressure caused by enormous thermal emissions from\nstrange stars might plays a more important role in promoting a shock, substituting neutrinos\nin conventional delayed shock mechanism. We call this proposed scenario as a photon-driven\nsupernova. Quark stars formed in this way should be bare, and factually, there are possible\nobservational evidence for bare strange stars (Xu et al. 1999; Xu 2002; Yue et al. 2006).\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\n2.\n\nThe Model\n\nDue to the different properties between neutron stars and strange stars, the consequent\nmechanism in explosion could be significantly altered. A detonation wave burning nuclear\nmatter into strange matter spreads out from the core (Lugones et al. 1994), where the density\ndeclines as radius increases. A boundary of strange matter and nuclear matter will be set\nwhere the detonation wave stops when nuclear matter density drops blow a critical value.\nNevertheless, the outer mantle on the other hand is still in-falling with hardly any variation\nsince the detonation wave travels faster than the sound speed. In both the prompt and the\ndelayed shock mechanisms, the previous shock which ejects the overlying mantle is initially\ngenerated by the bounce at the surface of neutron stars (Bethe 1990). However, if a nascent\nstrange star is formed by a detonation wave, the strange matter behind the wavefront is\nconsidered nearly at rest (Lugones et al. 1994) and hence no bounce could be introduced.\nAs a consequence of the high optical opacity in the collapsing core with density \u03c1\n\u22121\nand temperature T (Padmanabhan 2000), \u03baph = \u03baph0 \u03c1T 3.5 cm2 g , the radiation pressure\ncaused by photon-electron scattering prevents a thin layer of nuclear matters outside from\nfalling onto the surface of nascent strange star and thus inverses its velocity, where \u03baph0 =\n4 \u00d7 1025 Z(1 + X), atomic charge number Z, and hydrogen mass fraction X. This layer\nbeing affected extends to the sonic point because super-sonic fluid cannot be affected by\nperturbations downstream. As soon as the layer between the strange star surface and the\nsonic point assembles the radiation pressure after an equilibrium is established, a shock will\nbe generated at the sonic point for the discontinuities in both density and pressure.\nAs the overlying mantle is driven outwards by the shock, a gap is left between the\nstrange star and the out-going matter. This gap is filled up by a fireball, with high energy\nphotons and electron-positron pair plasma emitted from the hot strange star. We illustrate\nthe initial collapsing core divided into four parts in Fig. 1.\nThough annihilation of \u03b3 into e+ e\u2212 pairs and the reverse process take place at such\nhigh energy scale, the total momentum and energy fluxes are preserved. Hence we may still\nadopt the formula Prad = aT 4 /3, where Prad is radiation pressure and a is the radiation\nconstant. The pressure decreases as the fireball expands, with an assumption of Prad \u221d r \u2212n ,\nwhere r is the radius of fireball. In a radiation dominated relativistic fireball with a vacuum\nexterior, we have n = 4, i.e., Prad \u221d r \u22124 (Piran et al. 1993). However, the exterior of the\nfireball is actually not vacuum but fall-back matter, which must exert a force to the fireball.\nThe expanding speed of fireball is lower than the speed of light, and the radiation pressure\nshould then not drop so fast, i.e. the index n could be smaller than 4. In a special case for\nnormal radiation, one may have Prad \u221d r \u22122 from flux conservation. Therefore we generalize\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\nthe relation as\n\nRn\n1\n(1)\nPrad (r) = aT 4 n ,\n3\nr\nwhere R is the radius of the strange star, and three cases of n = 4, 3, 2 will be considered.\nOur main goal is to check whether the work done on the overlying mantle by the radiation\npressure is comparable to 1051 erg, the typical energy needed for a successful supernova\nexplosion. The work done by the fireball reads,\nZ rf\nW =\n4\u03c0r 2 Prad (r)dr.\n(2)\nR\n\nwhere rf is the final distance that the radiation pressure could push the out layers to. The\ndistance can be estimated by velocity of the shocked matter and the radiation-dominated\ntimescale.\nSince mean free path of photons in dense nuclear matter is extremely short, \u03bb =\n1/(\u03c1\u03baph ) = 1/(\u03baph0 \u03c12 T 3.5 ), radiative heating is very inefficient. The time scale for transferring most part of the energy to the shock is excessively shorter than the kinematic timescale,\nas we can see later in our calculation. The lack of energy transferred to the outside of\nfireball could essentially help a successful explosion. Moreover, we can therefore omit the\nthin layer that has been heated in region 2 and consider the pressure within these two regions contributed by degenerate electrons alone, complying with the polytropic equations:\nP1 \u221d \u03c1\u03b31 , P2 \u221d \u03c1\u03b32 . Because both the shock and the shocked matter are supported by the\nradiation pressure ultimately, we assume that pressure in region 2 equals to the radiation\npressure for simplicity though in the actual explosion non-uniform pressure distribution must\nexists.\nMeanwhile, we solve the relativistic shock equation (Landau & Lifshitz 1999) and obtain\nthe speed of the shocked matters moving outwards,\nv1\n(P2 \u2212 P1 )(e2 + P1 ) 1/2 v2\n(P2 \u2212 P1 )(e1 + P2 ) 1/2\n=[\n] ,\n=[\n] .\nc\n(e2 \u2212 e1 )(e1 + P2 )\nc\n(e2 \u2212 e1 )(e2 + P1 )\n\n(3)\n\nwhere v is velocity and e stands for energy density. Note that these values are derived in\na coordinate system where the shock wave surface is at rest. Subscript 1 and 2 represent\ncorresponding values in regions 1 and 2 (defined in Fig. 1), respectively. Adopting the\nnumerical solution of last good homology [Table 1 of Brown et al. (1982)] and applying the\nradiation pressure of Eq.(1) to region 2, the velocity of the shock's propagation rate can be\nachieved by\nv1 \u2212 V1\n,\n(4)\nVshock = c2\nv1 V1 \u2212 c2\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\nwhere V is the velocity in the inertial frame where the collapsing center is at rest. Thus the\nvelocity of region 2 in the center inertial frame can be obtained,\nV 2 = c2\n\nVshock + v2\ndr\n= .\n2\nVshock v2 + c\ndt\n\n(5)\n\nFinally, we obtain the velocity of the shocked matter (about 0.1 speed of light) and hence\nthe expansion speed of the fireball.\nStrange quark matter at high density and small temperature is expected to exhibit\ncolor-superconductivity (CSC), induced by quark pairing and condensation at the Fermi\nsurface, with energy gaps \u2206 \u2243100 MeV (Alford et al. 1998; Ouyed et al. 2005) and associated\ncritical temperatures Tc \u2243 0.6\u2206, above which thermal fluctuations destroy the condensate\n(Rajagopal & Wilczek 2000). If the density is sufficiently high, a color-flavor locked (CFL)\nphase is the favored ground state (e.g., Ouyed et al. 2005).\nThe surface emissivity of photons with energies below ~\u03c9p \u2243 23MeV (\u03c9p : electromagnetic plasma frequency) is strongly suppressed (Usov 2001). As shown in Vogt et al. (2004),\naverage photon energies in CFL matter at temperature T are \u223c 3T . Therefore, when the\nsurface temperature of the star drops below Tf = ~\u03c9p /3 \u2243 7.7MeV, the photon emissivity\ncan be considered shut off. As long as we know the cooling behavior, we can then estimate\nthe timescale of radiation-dominated period.\nA nascent quark star is actually not an isothermal, homogeneous sphere (e.g., Ouyed et al.\n2005). The thermal evolution is determined by the energy conservation and heat transport\nequations,\n\u2202T\n1 \u2202(r 2 Fr )\n\u2202T\nCv\n=\u2212 2\n\u2212 \u01eb\u03bd , Fr = \u2212\u03ba ,\n(6)\n\u2202t\nr\n\u2202r\n\u2202r\nwhere Cv is the specific heat of the star matter, \u03ba is its thermal conductivity, \u01eb is the neutrino\nemissivity, and Fr is the heat flux at radius r.\nFor normal quark matter (Iwamoto 1982), one has\nCv \u2243 1.6 \u00d7 1021 T9 erg cm\u22123 K\u22121 , \u01eb\u03bd = 3 \u00d7 1024 T96 erg cm\u22123 s\u22121 .\n\n(7)\n\nThe heat capacity of the quark matter with color superconductivity (CFL phase, Blaschke et al.\n2000) could be\nCv \u2243 5.1 \u00d7 1021 T9 (Tc /T )exp(\u2212\u2206/T )[2.5 \u2212 1.7T /Tc + 3.6(T /Tc )2 ] erg cm\u22123 K\u22121 ,\n\n(8)\n\nwhere \u2206 is the energy gap and Tc is the critical temperature, and the neutrino emissivity\nfor this CFL state is (Jaikumar & Prakash 2001),\n\u01eb\u03bd = 2 \u00d7 1020 T97 erg cm\u22123 s\u22121 .\n\n(9)\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\nIt is evident from Eq.(7) and Eq.(9) that the neutrino emissivity could be much lower in CFL\nstate than in normal state of quark matter. Low \u03bd-emissivity favors keeping a high surface\ntemperature of CFL stars (Fig. 2), that helps to form an energetic fireball. According to\nShovkovy & Ellis (2002), the conductivity in Eq.(6) reads\n3\n\u03ba = 1.2 \u00d7 1027 TMeV\n\u03bbGB erg cm\u22121 s\u22121 K\u22121 ,\n\n\u03bbGB (T ) =\n\n4(21 \u2212 8ln2)\n\u221a\ncm.\n15 2\u03c0TMeV\n\n(10)\n\nIn addition, we choose the following boundary conditions: at the center and the surface\nof the star, we have F (r = 0) = 0 and F (r = R) = \u03c3T 4 . As for the initial condition,\nwe assume the temperature of the star at t = 0 be uniform, T (t = 0) = T0 . The initial\ntemperature of the new born strange star can be estimated to be tens of MeV. Once we input\nT0 , Eq.(6) can be solved numerically. We can then obtain radiation-dominated timescale and\nhence calculate the total work done by the fireball.\n\n3.\n\nThe Results\n\nIn the calculation shown in Fig. 2, we find that the cooling rate of strange matter with\nCSC is slower than that of normal quark matter, and with bigger energy gap, the CSC matter\ncools faster. In about \u223c1 ms, the surface temperature of a CFL star will drop below 7.7\nMeV, the typical threshold of photon emission. The timescale of strong thermal radiation is\nadequately short, and thus we can safely use the assumption that the heating process in the\nthin layer in region 2 of Fig. 1 will not influence much to the mechanism.\nIn Fig. 3 we calculate the work done by radiation pressure with different pressure-radius\nrelationships, i.e. different value of index n in Eq.(1), and with different initial temperatures.\nIt can be seen that, for a typical condition (e.g., T0 = 50MeV, R = 10km, n = 3), the work\nwould exceed 2.7 \u00d7 1051 erg within radiation dominated timescale, which may result in a\nsuccessful explosion. For different initial temperatures, the work could pass 1051 erg once\nthe initial temperature exceed about 40MeV. Note that the initial temperature could be\n(30-40) MeV for normal neutron stars (Burrows & Lattimer 1986). More energy (i.e., both\ngravitation and phase-transition energies) should be released for quark stars if the conjecture\nby Witten (1984) is correct. Unfortunately, it is still model-dependent to determine the real\ninitial temperature of a quark star. From Fig.3, we could conclude that the total work done\nby the fireball could be enough for successful supernova if the initial temperatures is greater\nthan \u223c (30 \u2212 40) MeV.\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\n4.\n\nConclusions and Discussions\n\nA photon-driven mechanism is proposed for successful core-collapse supernovae, and\nbare strange quark stars are residues after the explosions. It is found through calculations\nthat radiation pressure can push the overlying mantle away through photon-electron scattering with energy (the work done by radiation pressure) as much as \u223c 1051 erg, the typical\nenergy needed for core-collapse supernovae.\nRegarding the difference between nuclear matter and strange quark matter, a strange\nstar can have a much higher surface temperature than a neutron star and accordingly a\ngreater thermal photon emission. In addition, the strong electric field (\u223c 1017 V/cm) on\nquark surface should play an important role in producing the thermal emission too [i.e., the\nUsov mechanism (Usov 1998, 2001)], which is in the same order of blackbody radiation when\nT > 5 \u00d7 1010 K. Furthermore, this distinction results in a huge radiation pressure that leads\nto a much faster explosion than the conventional delayed-shock model. The photon-driven\nsupernova may benefit not only from the radiation pressure but also a much smaller photodissociation effect while most part of the mantle is blown away before the iron-cores could\never interact with high energy photons, hence making it possible to provide sufficient energy\nand promote a successful explosion.\nLow-mass bare strange stars could form via accretion-induce collapse of white dwarfs\n(Xu 2005). A low energy budget is needed in this scenario since the gravitational binding\nenergy of a white dwarf with approximate Chandrasekhar mass is only \u223c 1050 erg.\nThis photon-driven mechanism may also provide an alternative figure how a fireball\ncan be produced during cosmic long-soft \u03b3\u2212ray bursts, which are observed associated with\nsupernovae. It is worth noting that, due to the chromatic confinement of quark surfaces,\nthe baryon contamination would be very low in such fireballs, that is necessary in the models (Cheng & Dai 1996; Dai & Lu 1998; Wang et al. 2000). Similar \u03b3-ray burst fireballs\ndue to the color-flavor locked phase-transition as well as magnetic field decay were noted\n(Ouyed et al. 2005, 2006). It is worth noting that Cui et. al. (2007) showed statistically\nthat long-soft \u03b3-ray burst could be really related to supernova and that the asymmetry of\nbursts associated with supernova would cause the kick of pulsars.\nThe authors would like to thank the referee for his/her very constructive comments and\nsuggestions, and wish to acknowledge useful discussions with Guojun Qiao, Weiwei Zhu,\nYouling Yue and Moda Cao at Peking University.
