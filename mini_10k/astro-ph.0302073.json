X-ray studies of eclipsing polars are particularly valuable\nfor understanding the geometry of the accretion region, and to learn about the\ninteraction of matter with the magnetic field near the coupling region, the stellar\nmasses, the shock height, and the temperature distribution near the white dwarf\nsurface. A hard X-ray study of polars with large area and broad-band X-ray\ndetectors like the Proportional Counter Array (PCA) on board the (RXT E)\nsatellite provides an excellent opportunity to learn about these effects and to\n1\n\n\f2\n\nSingh, K. P. et al.\n\nestimate the mass of the white dwarf by measuring the maximum temperature\nof the post-shock plasma.\nWe have analyzed the X-ray data obtained of 5 Polars and 1 Intermediate\nPolar (IP) as listed in Table 1 along with some of their important properties.\nThe dates of the observations of each source and the mean count rate in the 2\u201320\nkeV band are given in Table 2. Most of the observations have the source in the\ncenter of the field of view of PCA, except for the 2002 observation of V1432 Aql\nwhich is intentionally offset to minimize the contribution of flux from NGC6814.\n\nTable 1.\nName\nV2301 Oph\nV1432 Aql\nEP Dra\nGG Leo\nV834 Cen\nTV Col\n\nTable 2.\nName\nV2301 Oph\nV1432 Aql\nEP Dra\nGG Leo\nV834 Cen\n\nTV Col\n\n2.\n\nProperties\nMagnitude\n(Visual)\n15\u201317\n14.2\u201318\n18\n16\u201317\n15\n14.1\n\nof the 5 Polars\nSpin Period\n(seconds)\n6780\n12150\n6276\n4792.767\n6090\n1911\n\n& 1 IP in\nDistance\n(pc)\n150\u00b127\n230\n\u223c450\n>100\n86\n368\n\nthe sample\nReferences\nSRHB, BRB, Hess97, SI, SS\nW95, P95, GS\nRSTS, S99, SM\nBur98, Sz00\nJNJ, M83, B83, C90, S93\nBDW, H93, A94, R02\n\nSummary of RXT E Observations analyzed\nDate\nExposure Time Count Rate\n(Y M D)\n(seconds)\n(2-20 keV)\n1997 05 27-30 13200\n6\u201316\n1997 09 26-28 5700\n4-21\n1997 11 22-24 39500\n15-23\n1998 06 23-25 16700\n23-33\n2002 07 14-15 19700\n18-20\n1998 08 28\n14303\n1.2\n1999 05 07\n4688\n3.3\n1996 05 14-18 8700\n5-9\n1997 08 02\n16256\n8\n1998 06 23-25 20400\n9-11\n2002 01 18, 24 18600\n< 0.5\n1996 08 09-13 82000\n30-50\n\nOffset(\u2032 )\n0.06\n0.06\n0.06\n0.01\n14.8\n0.1\n0.03\n0.01\n0.03\n0.04\n0.04\n0.1\n\n2-20 keV Light Curves of Polars\n\nX-ray light curves of V2301 Oph and V1432 Aql in the 2-20 keV energy band\nare shown in Figures 1 and 2 respectively for each of the long observations.\nSeveral total eclipses were seen clearly in V2301 Oph and along with previous observations used to derive an improved ephemeris for the system: HJD =\n2448071.02051(2) + 0.0784499794(10)E. The out-of-eclipse intensity of V 2301\nOph changes on daily and monthly timescales, while the light curve shape and\nthe eclipse ingress and egress remain unchanged (see Fig. 1).

Style\n\n5\n\nhardness ratio is, however, found to remain constant throughout. These intensity variations, therefore, lead to luminosity variations and suggest that the\nmass accretion rate varies on these timescales. V1432 Aql also shows complete\neclipses (the small residual amount \u226410% of the peak is due to contamination\nby NGC 6814) in both the observations shown in Fig. 2. Several dips are seen\nbetween the phases 0.35 to 0.52, and rapid flickering is observed near the maximum in the highly complicated light curve of V1432 Aql. Total eclipses have\nalso been observed in the 2\u201320 keV light curves of EP Dra and GG Leo shown in\nFig. 3. The residual count rate in EP Dra is fully accounted for by contribution\nfrom a nearby (\u223c8.3\u2032 away) cluster of galaxies A2317. V834 Cen shows yearly\nintensity variations (Fig. 3) with changing maximum intensity as a function of\nphase while the minimum intensity remains the same. It was not detectable in\n2002, and therefore, presumed to have a entered a very low state.\n3.\n\nTV Col: Spin and Orbital Periods\n\nA 5 day long X-ray observation of an intermediate polar, TV Col, is reported\nhere for the first time. The power spectral distribution of its light curve obtained\nby using the CLEAN (see Norton, Beardmore & Taylor 1996) method and thus\nremoving the window function, is shown in Fig. 4. It clearly displays the presence of a sinusoidal oscillation (spin period) at 1910s and that of modulation due\nto orbital period of 5.5h. Several other peaks due to various harmonics and side\nbands of the spin, orbital period and the precession period of 4d (see Norton et\nal. 1996; Retter et al. 2002) are also seen. In particular, power is detected at\nside-band frequencies corresponding to periods of 5.2h, 5.8h, and 6.2h (or beats\nbetween the orbital and precession period).\n4.\n\nX-ray Spectra of Polars\n\nThe hard X-ray emission is believed to originate from the hot gas in the postshock region gradually cooling and settling on to the white dwarf. It is, therefore,\nexpected that the post-shock region should have a temperature gradient with a\nlow temperature at the bottom of the accretion column and high near the shock\nfront, and a continuous temperature distribution in between. Multi-temperature\nplasma models are therefore required to quantify the temperature distribution\nand line emission (Done, Osborne & Beardmore 1995). In addition, the preshock material is exposed to hard X-rays thus ionizing it, which can give rise\nto complex absorption effects. A considerable fraction of hard X-rays from the\npost-shock region, can also be reflected by the white dwarf surface. Hence, it\nis important to take into account all the above processes while characterizing\nthe X-ray emission. Several spectral models ranging from the simple thermal\nbremsstrahlung to plasma emission models with continuous emission measure\n(cevmekl), and cooling flow were used to fit the X-ray spectra. The best fit\nspectral parameters derived from two models : thermal bremsstrahlung plus\nabsorption, and cevmekl with ionised absorber and reflection are shown in Table\n3. The 2\u201310 keV flux values given in Table 3 are in units of 10\u221211 ergs cm\u22122\ns\u22121 . The errors and the range of values for the parameters listed in the table\nare with 90% confidence. The thermal bremsstrahlung models always required\n\n\f6\n\nSingh, K. P. et al.\n\nFigure 4.\nClean power spectrum of TV Col obtained after subtracting the mean count rate. Inset shows modulation at the spin period.\n\nthe presence of an emission line component (a broad Gaussian) with the line\nenergy indicating the dominance of the plasma emission from Fe XV or FeXVI\nover fluorescence of cold Fe. The cevmekl models describe the physical situation\nmuch better. These models indicate subsolar abundance for Fe and provide\na maximum temperature that is somewhat lower than that derived from the\nsimple bremsstrahlung models (Table 3). The best fit maximum temperatures\nfrom Model 2 were used to estimate the mass of the white dwarf in these systems.\nThe estimated masses (Table 3) are consistent, within errors, with the previous\nestimates given by Ramsay (1997) using a more realistic spectral model.\n\nTable 3.\nName\nV2301 Oph\nV1432 Aql\nEP Dra\nGG Leo\nV834 Cen\n\nSpectral\nModel 1\nkTbrem\nkeV\n12-15\n50-75\n5-9\n38+56\n\u221216\n11+2\n\u22122\n\nParameters of Polars\nEF e\nkeV\n6.5-6.8\n6.4-6.6\n6.5-7.1\n6.4-7.0\n6.6-7.0\n\nkTmax\nkeV\n10-20\n12-18\n10+5\n\u22124\n22+78\n\u221215\n8.5+4.5\n\u22123.5\n\nNH (warm)\n1022 cm\u22122\n1.5-3.2\n2.4-3.5\n<1.1\n<5.0\n1.5-3.8\n\nModel 2\nAF e\nRelative\n0.11-0.28\n0.17-0.31\n0.3-1.4\n0.15-0.45\n0.20-0.67\n\nFluxa\n3.30\n4.00\n0.32\n0.84\n1.66\n\nMW D\nM\u2299\n0.90+0.10\n\u22120.15\n0.90+0.08\n\u22120.07\n0.75+0.18\n\u22120.32\n1.1+0.3\n\u22120.5\n0.70+0.15\n\u22120.20\n\n\fAPS Conf.
