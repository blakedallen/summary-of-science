A\ncomparison with other stellar population properties suggests that this gas removal is\ndominated by galaxy interactions with the hot intragroup medium.\nKey words: galaxies: clusters: NGC 5044 group - galaxies: distances and redshift galaxies: fundamental parameters - galaxies: formation - galaxies: evolution\n\n1\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nLarge photometric surveys have established that the observable galaxy population forms two distinct sequences in\ncolour-magnitude space: a red sequence of predominantly\nearly-type galaxies and a star-forming, late-type dominated\nblue sequence (e.g. Hogg et al. 2002; Blanton et al. 2003;\nBaldry et al. 2006). Recent observational evidence suggests\nthat growth of the red sequence since z \u223c 1 is dominated\n\u2217\nby increasing numbers of low-luminosity ( <\n\u223c L ) red galaxies with cosmic time at the expense of the low-luminosity\nstar-forming galaxy population (e.g. Bell et al. 2004; Bundy\net al. 2006; Brown et al. 2007; Faber et al. 2007). Hence, our\n\n\u22c6\n\ntmendel@swin.edu.au\n\nunderstanding of growth and evolution in the red sequence\nis closely related to our knowledge of processes responsible\nfor quenching star formation in blue-sequence galaxies, enabling their subsequent evolution onto the red sequence.\nThe dichotomy of observed galaxy colours carries with\nit an increasingly well-described environmental dependence\nwhereby galaxies inhabiting high-density regions are on average redder, older, more concentrated and more massive\nthan galaxies found in the field (e.g. Oemler 1974; Dressler\n1980; Goto et al. 2003; Blanton 2005; Blanton & Berlind\n2007; O'Mill, Padilla & Lambas 2008; Cooper et al. 2008).\nThis strong correlation of red-sequence galaxies with local\ngalaxy density has led to a significant body of work devoted\nto exploring the environmental factors responsible for creating these predominantly red populations from the blue, star-\n\n\f2\n\nMendel et al.\n\nforming population of field galaxies. Of the possible mechanisms for suppressing star formation, ram-pressure stripping\n(e.g. Gunn & Gott 1972; Hester 2006), mergers (e.g. Toomre\n& Toomre 1972; Negroponte & White 1983; Somerville &\nPrimack 1999; McIntosh et al. 2008), strangulation (e.g.\nLarson, Tinsley & Caldwell 1980; Balogh & Morris 2000),\ntidal interactions and harassment (e.g. Farouki & Shapiro\n1981; Moore et al. 1996) are the most frequently invoked\nto account for the increasing number density of red galaxies. Identifying which of these possible processes represents\nthe dominant evolutionary path, however, remains an active\nfield of research.\nThe Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) has proved fundamental in exploring the environmental dependence of galaxy\nproperties, and has been used to show that the transformation of galaxies from blue to red takes place over relatively long timescales, >\n\u223c 1 Gyr, through the slow exhaustion\nof gas available for star formation, rather than rapid, violent removal (e.g. Kauffmann et al. 2004; van den Bosch\net al. 2008). The dominance of so called \"strangulation\"\n(Balogh & Morris 2000) precludes cluster-cores as dominant sites for blue galaxy transformation as disruption processes in high-density regions, e.g. ram-pressure stripping\nand harassment, act over relatively short timescales (e.g.\nAbadi, Moore & Bower 1999; Quilis, Moore & Bower 2000).\nThis supports earlier work from the 2dF Galaxy Redshift\nSurvey (2dFGRS) which found that the fraction of star\nforming galaxies is lower with respect to the field even at\nthe relatively low surface densities of loose groups, \u223c12 galaxies/Mpc2 , i.e. well outside dense cluster cores (e.g.\nLewis et al. 2002; Poggianti et al. 2006).\nWhile the majority of our understanding of the variation of galaxy properties with environment hinges on large\nphotometric surveys, an alternative approach is the use of\nspectral absorption features as detailed tracers of galaxy\nstellar populations. In many ways spectral analyses provide\na vastly increased level of detail for determining paths of\ngalaxy formation and evolution relative to photometry, but\nthey are often hindered by smaller sample sizes and relatively high observational expense. Nevertheless, absorptionline studies have met with great success in tracing the stellar\npopulations of individual galaxies (e.g. Proctor et al. 2004;\nThomas et al. 2005; S\u00e1nchez-Bl\u00e1zquez et al. 2006; Peletier\net al. 2007; Spolaor et al. 2008), clusters (e.g. Smith, Lucey\n& Hudson 2007; Smith et al. 2008a,b; Trager et al. 2008)\nand large survey samples (e.g. Gallazzi et al. 2006; Jimenez\net al. 2007; Proctor et al. 2008).\nTo date, spectroscopic studies with a particular focus\non environment have primarily made use of cluster galaxy\npopulations. Caldwell, Rose & Concannon (2003) used a\nsample of nearby early-type galaxies in the Virgo Cluster, as well as a field-galaxy sample, to probe galaxy stellar populations to low masses (stellar velocity dispersions,\n\u03c3, < 100 km s\u22121 ). Caldwell et al. (2003) found a greater intrinsic scatter in the properties of low-mass galaxies, but\nmade no particular effort to examine the spatial distribution\nof galaxy populations within the Virgo Cluster. In similar\nwork, Smith et al. (2007) and Smith et al. (2008a,b) have\nexamined the stellar populations of dwarf galaxies in the\nComa Cluster and Shapley supercluster, in both instances\nfinding that the scaling relations of low-mass populations\nare generally consistent with the relations of higher-mass\n\nE and S0 galaxies, although with the same increased scatter noted by Caldwell et al. (2003). In the case of Coma,\nSmith et al. (2008a) find a radial dependence of both age\nand metallicity, where galaxies at larger projected radii are\nboth younger and higher metallicity, suggestive of recently\nquenched star formation among galaxies entering the Coma\ncluster outskirts and consistent with earlier spectral studies\nof Coma cluster galaxies (Caldwell et al. 1993; Mobasher\net al. 2001; Carter et al. 2002).\nThese studies, however, only serve to probe rare highdensity cluster environments, neglecting the much more\ncommon group environment. In an attempt to fill this gap,\nhere we undertake a detailed spectroscopic study of the\ngalaxy population in the NGC 5044 group with the aim of\ndescribing galaxy evolutionary histories and reconstructing\nthe formation history of the group as a whole. In a previous paper (Mendel et al. 2008; hereafter Paper I), we used\nnew, deep spectroscopic observations in conjunction with\narchival velocity information to more than triple the number of velocity-confirmed group members. This greatly improved sample has allowed us to characterise the dynamical\nstate of the group, which we find to be relaxed from a combination of X-ray and dynamical indicators. Here, we turn\nour focus to analysing the stellar populations of galaxies in\nthis redefined group with a focus on establishing the details\nof galaxy evolution in the context of the group environment.\nThe structure of this paper is as follows: Section\n2 describes the spectroscopic data used from both new\nAAOmega observations and the 6dF Galaxy Survey. Here\nwe also describe the method used to derive kinematic properties. In Section 3 we discuss the measurement of Lick index\nabsorption features and their interpretation in terms of age,\nmetallicity and \u03b1-element abundance (Section 4). In subsequent sections we discuss the stellar population properties\nof NGC 5044 group galaxies both as an independent galaxy\nsample (Section 5), and in the context of their place in the\ngroup as a whole (Section 6). In Section 7 we describe the\ndistribution of emission-line properties for NGC 5044 group\ngalaxies. In Section 8 we discuss our stellar population findings in relation to the dynamical description of the group\npresented in Paper I, as well as their relevance to the formation and evolution of the NGC 5044 group and galaxies\ntherein.\nThroughout this paper we assume H0 =\n70 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 where relevant. We adopt a distance\nmodulus for the NGC 5044 group of (m \u2212 M )0 = 32.31\n(28.99 Mpc) measured using surface brightness fluctuations\n(Tonry et al. 2001) with corrections applied to adjust for\nthe improved Cepheid distance measurements of Jensen\net al. (2003). Where specified, correlations have been\nmeasured using the Kendall rank-order correlation test\nwith significance quoted from the two-tailed p-value.\n\n2\n\nDATA\n\nHere we use the NGC 5044 group sample defined in Paper\nI, which consists of 111 spectroscopically-confirmed group\nmembers compiled using newly obtained redshifts from\nAAOmega supplemented using the 6dF Galaxy Survey Data\n\n\fNGC 5044 group stellar populations\nRelease 2 (6dFGS DR21 ; Jones et al. 2005), HI observations\n(Kilborn et al. in preparation) and the Nasa/IPAC Extragalactic Database (NED) sources. Of these 111 galaxies, 95\nhave spectra available from AAOmega and 6dFGS observations which can be used to measure absorption indices (71\nfrom our new AAOmega observations and 24 from 6dFGS\nDR2). These spectral data are summarised below.\n\n2.1\n\nAAOmega spectroscopy\n\nNew observations of NGC 5044 group galaxies were carried\nout using the AAOmega multi-object spectrograph on the\n3.9m Anglo-Australian Telescope (AAT) in Siding Spring,\nAustralia. Target galaxies were taken from the list of potential NGC 5044 group members of Ferguson & Sandage\n(1990). Medium resolution 580V and 385R gratings were\nused, yielding FWHM dispersions of 3.5 \u00c5 and 5.3 \u00c5 for\nblue (\u03bb\u03bb3700-5700\u00c5) and red (\u03bb\u03bb5700-8800\u00c5) spectra respectively.\nGalaxies were separated into high\u2013 and low\u2013luminosity\nsubsamples using an apparent magnitude cut of B = 15\nand observed separately in order to limit the effects of scattered light from the brightest sources. Observations were\ncarried out 30 minutes at a time with a total of 3 to 4 observations per plate configuration. In addition to fibres assigned to galaxies, in each configuration an additional 30 to\n35 \"empty\" fibres were assigned to be used for sky subtraction. There are several relatively wide defects in the blue\narm CCD of AAOmega, and to limit the effects of these\non our final coadded science spectra we offset the central\nwavelength on each night of observations by 100 \u00c5, ensuring that usable data were obtained from at least two out of\nthree nights at every wavelength. Our total integration time\nfor high- and low-luminosity galaxies was 4 and 17 hours\nrespectively.\nIn addition to our primary (galaxy) targets we have\nobserved a set of calibration stars. These include stars common to the Lick stellar library (see \u00a73.2) and a set of spectrophotometric calibrators which we can use to roughly flux\ncalibrate the AAOmega data.\nData were reduced using a combination of iraf routines and the 2dfdr reduction pipeline supplied and maintained by the Anglo-Australian Observatory. Prior to reduction with 2dfdr an average bias was subtracted from all\nframes and bad pixel columns were identified and repaired.\nWe then used 2dfdr to reject cosmic rays, identify fibre\napertures, flat-field, throughput calibrate and sky subtract\nthe data. The final coaddition of science frames was carried\nout after excluding any single exposures with very low flux\nrelative to the other frames.\nIn this work, we consider only those galaxies identified\nas group members in Paper I, and refer the reader to that\nwork for the details of how group membership was defined.\nWe exclude from subsequent analyses any galaxies with a\nsignal-to-noise (S/N) of less than 12, as below this we consider stellar population measurements to be highly unreliable. This cut excludes 19 galaxies, leaving a total of 52 from\nthe original AAOmega sample described in Paper I.\n\n1\n\nThe most recent data release available at the time of writing.\n\n2.2\n\n3\n\n6dFGS Spectral Data\n\nThe 6dFGS covers 17046 deg2 of the Southern sky using\nthe Six-Degree Field (6dF) multi-fibre spectrograph on the\nUK Schmidt Telescope. The survey targets are selected from\nthe 2MASS Extended Source Catalogue (2MASS XSC; Jarrett et al. 2000), 2MASS and SuperCOSMOS to include\nall galaxies brighter than Ktot = 12.75 mag with wavelength coverage from \u03bb\u03bb4000-8400\u00c5. In Paper I we include\n16 unique 6dFGS galaxies and 8 galaxies that overlap with\nour AAOmega sample, all of which have spectra available.\nHowever, applying a similar cut in S/N as the AAOmega\ndata above excludes an additional 9 of the 6dFGS galaxies,\nleaving a total of 15 for stellar populations analysis.\nThe combined AAOmega and 6dFGS sample then consists of 67 confirmed group-member galaxies with S/N > 12,\nwhich we use for the remainder of this analysis.\n\n2.3\n\nRecession velocity and velocity dispersion\nmeasurements\n\nRecession velocities and velocity dispersions were fit simultaneously using the penalised pixel-fitting (pPXF) software\nof Cappellari & Emsellem (2004). Pixel fitting methods are\nnotoriously sensitive to the templates used, so it is important to minimise the effects of so-called template mismatch\non kinematic measurements. The pPXF code is an extension of the Gauss-Hermite fitting method of van der Marel\n& Franx (1993) which allows for fitting to be carried out\nusing a linear combination of template spectra, all but eliminating template-mismatch-induced errors.\nAs our input templates we use 50 stellar spectra\nfrom the MILES standard star library (S\u00e1nchez-Bl\u00e1zquez\net al. 2006) spanning a broad range of spectral types. The\nparticular choice of stars used to construct templates has\nonly a minimal effect on the results derived using pPXF as\nlong as they span a similar range of spectral types. We have\ninvestigated this briefly by fitting a sub-sample of our galaxy\ndata with sets of 50 randomly chosen stars from the MILES\nlibrary and find typical deviations of \u223c4-5 km s\u22121 in velocity\ndispersion.\nIn order for pPXF to provide meaningful velocity dispersion outputs we need to account for the difference in instrumental dispersion between our AAOmega spectra and\nthe MILES stellar library. Overlap between the Lick and\nMILES stellar libraries is significant, so we have used the\nLick standard stars observed throughout our AAOmega observing run to effectively measure the wavelength dependent broadening offset between AAOmega and the MILES\nlibrary. In total we use 5 Lick/MILES stars to measure the\nmedian broadening difference. We find that scatter in our\nbroadening measurements is significant for wavelengths below 4700 \u00c5, but above this wavelength the dispersion offset\nis relatively stable at \u223c57.7 km s\u22121 (2.3 \u00c5 FWHM). Adding\nin quadrature the spectral resolution of the MILES library,\n2.3 \u00c5, gives an average spectral resolution for AAOmega between 4700 \u00c5 and 5400 \u00c5 of 3.2 \u00c5 FWHM. This derived resolution is consistent with that found by Smith et al. (2007)\nfor spectra taken using the 580V grating on AAOmega.\nStandard star observations for the 16 6dFGS galaxies that we define as group members are unavailable, but\nwe can measure the broadening offset between AAOmega\n\n\f4\n\nMendel et al.\n\nand 6dF using the 8 galaxies present in both samples. In the \u03bb\u03bb4700-5400 \u00c5 wavelength range we find a\nmean offset between AAOmega and 6dFGS spectra of\n103.6 km s\u22121 (4.1 \u00c5 FWHM). Adding in quadrature the previously measured offset between AAOmega and the MILES\nlibrary in this spectral region we adopt a total broadening of\n118.6 km s\u22121 (4.7 \u00c5 FWHM). The difference in aperture size\nbetween the 6dF and AAOmega fibres (6.7\u2032\u2032 vs. 2.1\u2032\u2032 ) will result in an additional broadening difference between the two\ngalaxy spectra, independent of instrument resolution, of order 5 percent (J\u00f8rgensen, Franx & Kjaergaard 1995). We do\nnot take this aperture effect into account when calculating\nour broadening as the statistical nature of the J\u00f8rgensen\net al. (1995) correction will likely only serve to introduce\nscatter in our relatively small number of galaxies, particularly given our broad range of galaxy types.\nPrior to measuring kinematics using pPXF, MILES\ntemplate spectra are smoothed to the AAOmega and 6dFGS\nresolution using the measured broadening offsets. The pPXF\ncode allows for a penalty to be applied to the higher order\nterms of the Gauss-Hermite polynomials and here we adopt\na moderately high bias of 0.8 throughout fitting in order to\nlimit spurious results from undersampled or low S/N data.\nRandom errors on our kinematic measurements are then calculated using a series of Monte Carlo simulations spanning\na range of velocity dispersions and S/N. The scatter in our\ndetermination of instrumental broadening discussed above\nadds an additional, systematic uncertainty to our velocity dispersion measurements of 22 km s\u22121 and 41 km s\u22121 for\nAAOmega and 6dFGS galaxies respectively, which we include in quadrature.\n\n2.4\n\nEmission-line measurements\n\nWe identify emission-line galaxies through examination of\nresiduals to the best fit pPXF templates, and for 24 galaxies\nin our sample we find evidence for emission in some combination of H\u03b2, [OIII]\u03bb4959 , [OIII]\u03bb5007 , [NI]\u03bb5198 and [NI]\u03bb5200 .\nWhile we can estimate emission-line fluxes from the residuals of our template fits, the underlying absorption in these\nregions is generally poorly constrained as emission contaminated lines are masked in the template fitting process.\nA far more robust method is to fit for absorption- and\nemission-line kinematics simultaneously, which we carry out\nusing the gandalf software of Sarzi et al. (2006). This is an\nextension of the pPXF pixel fitting routine described in \u00a72.3\nwhich fits simultaneously a set of absorption and emission\ntemplates, eliminating errors introduced by fitting emission\nline residuals separately. Fits to emission lines are conducted\nusing a set of independent Gaussian profiles whose kinematics can be varied as required. Here we treat the kinematics of\nnebular and Balmer-line emission separately, tying each to\nthe kinematics of the dominant features in appropriate regions of our spectra (H\u03b2 or H\u03b1 and [OIII]\u03bb5007 or [NII]\u03bb6583\nfor Balmer and nebular lines respectively). Our choice to\nfit separately the kinematics of Balmer and nebular emission lines has a negligible effect on our results as we find\nno galaxies with a significant kinematic difference between\nthe two (where both are detected). There is generally good\nagreement between kinematics measured using pPXF and\ngandalf; the largest offsets are observed in velocity disper-\n\nsion, and are only significant in galaxies with strong emission\nlines and relatively weak continuum flux.\ngandalf also allows for spectra to be cleaned of detected emission. Here we follow Sarzi et al. (2006) and adopt\nan amplitude-to-noise (A/N) threshold of 4, where noise is\ndefined as the scatter about the best-fit absorption template.\nAs both [NI] and H\u03b2 emission strongly affect our Lick index\nmeasurements the removal of these lines results in a significant improvement in the quality of stellar population fits for\nemission-line galaxies (see discussion in Section 4). The approximate detection threshold of emission lines in our data\ncan be calculated as a function of S/N using our adopted\nA/N and typical line broadening. If we assume a typical intrinsic line width of \u223c30\u201350 km s\u22121 , then our sensitivity is\n\u223c0.6 \u00c5 for AAOmega data and \u223c0.9 \u00c5 for 6dFGS data at\nthe median S/N of our galaxy data.\nWe use the H\u03b1/H\u03b2 Balmer decrement to calculate the\nextinction correction for our emission-line fluxes where applicable using the RV = 3.1 reddening curve of Cardelli,\nClayton & Mathis (1989) and an intrinsic H\u03b1/H\u03b2 line ratio\nof 2.85 (Osterbrock 1989). In galaxies with very low extinction the errors on our line-flux measurements can sometimes\nresult in a negative extinction estimate. As this is clearly\nnon-physical we adopt E(B \u2212 V ) \u2264 0.01 as an upper limit of\nextinction and assign this to galaxies with low or spurious\n(i.e. negative) extinction measurements.\n\n3\n\nLICK INDEX MEASUREMENTS AND\nCALIBRATION TO THE LICK/IDS SYSTEM\n\nHere we use Lick absorption features (Burstein et al. 1984;\nTrager et al. 1998) to characterise the stellar populations of\nour galaxies. Lick indices are defined based on their particular sensitivity to either age or metallicity, and so are useful\nfor describing these parameters in integrated spectra. Lick\nline-strength measurements were carried out using the index definitions of Trager et al. (1998), supplemented with\nhigher-order Balmer line definitions from Worthey & Ottaviani (1997). We omit from our Lick index measurements\nFe5782, NaD, TiO1 and TiO2 as these fall in the wavelength\nrange of the AAOmega dichroic where sensitivity is decreasing rapidly.\n3.1\n\nVelocity dispersion corrections\n\nIn order to properly compare measured indices with SSP\nmodels it is important that the total broadening of any\ngiven absorption feature matches the wavelength-dependent\nbroadening of the Lick/IDS system. Galaxies with combined\ninstrumental and velocity-dispersion broadening less than\nthe target Lick resolution are broadened as necessary using a wavelength-dependent Gaussian kernel to match the\ndescription of the Lick/IDS resolution given by Worthey &\nOttaviani (1997).\nIn cases where the combined instrument and velocity\ndispersion broadening is greater than the required Lick/IDS\nsystem resolution we calculate line-width corrections based\non iteratively broadened template stars. These line-width\nadjustments are then applied to correct measured indices\nback to the desired Lick/IDS resolution. As a test of this\nmethod, Proctor & Sansom (2002) compare stellar and\n\n\fNGC 5044 group stellar populations\n\n5\n\nTable 1.

For further details see Proctor\n& Sansom (2002).\n3.2\n\nLick/IDS system calibration\n\nIn order to calibrate index measurements to the Lick/IDS\nsystem, we have observed several stars from the Lick stellar\nlibrary at the beginning of each night. Index measurements\nfor AAOmega data are then adjusted based on a comparison\nof published Lick standard star indices and our stellar observations. The mean offsets found for each index are listed\nin Table 1, along with their associated r.m.s. error.\nWe are unable to calibrate 6dFGS data in the same way\nas AAOmega data, and so we generate two sets of indices\nfor 6dFGS galaxies: the first using the corrections provided\nin Table 1, and the second with no correction. We refer the\nreader to \u00a74.1 for a comparison of the properties derived\nusing these two sets of indices for overlapping 6dFGS and\nAAOmega galaxies.\n3.3\n\nFigure 1. H\u03b2 index error vs. signal-to-noise for galaxies in our\nspectroscopic sample. The solid line shows the best fit to our\nmeasured index errors as a function of S/N (see \u00a73.3), while the\ndashed line shows a similar fit for 6dFGS DR1 data derived by\nP+08. The dotted, vertical line shows our adopted S/N cut of 12.\n\nwhere a and b are constants, which was then used to calculate representative errors for the rest of the galaxy sample\nbased on their S/N. This method not only encapsulates redshift and velocity dispersion errors, but also errors resulting\nfrom sky subtraction, fibre flat-fielding and throughput calibration that are nearly impossible to quantify in individual\nfibre observations.\nHere we adopt a similar strategy to P+08 and exploit\nthe composite nature of our final spectra by re-measuring indices on individual observations, of which there are 12 and 34\nobservations each for bright and faint galaxies respectively.\nWe then adopt the \u03c3rms for these repeat measurements as\nan accurate representation of the stochastic errors in our\nsample (i.e. Poisson noise, sky-subtraction etc). In Fig. 1 we\nshow how the H\u03b2 index error derived in this manner varies\nas a function of S/N for the galaxies in our sample, and for\ncomparison we also show the line describing index errors as\nderived by P+08 for 6dFGS DR1 data. Error curves for all\nindices are shown in Appendix A.\nFor our AAOmega data the total adopted index error\nis a combination of this random error, the \u03c3r.m.s. associated\nwith conversion to the Lick/IDS system (\u00a73.2) and the index\nbroadening due to errors on velocity dispersion and recession\nvelocity measurements (\u00a72.3). For 6dFGS data we adopt the\nrecession velocity and velocity dispersion errors as discussed\nin \u00a72.3, as well as the index errors as a function of S/N\nderived by P+08.\n\nIndex errors\n\nThe fitting technique that we adopt for these data involves\nthe simultaneous \u03c72 minimisation for a large number of Lick\nindices (\u223c20). In order for these fits to be reliable, an accurate representation of index errors is crucial, but notoriously\ndifficult to obtain for spectral observations.\nProctor et al. (2008; hereafter P+08) have recently used\nspectra from the 6dFGS DR1 (Jones et al. 2004) to measure\nages and metallicities in a large sample of galaxies using Lick\nindices. In estimating their index errors, P+08 have used\nduplicate observations of the same galaxy (from overlapping\nsurvey regions) to calculate the r.m.s. scatter in their Lick index measurements at a given S/N. The r.m.s. value was then\nfit as a function of S/N using the form r.m.s. = a/(S/N + b),\n\n4\n\nSTELLAR POPULATION MODELS AND\nFITTING\n\nHaving compiled relevant Lick index measurements and\ntheir corresponding error, we now turn to the task of interpreting these measurements in terms of the stellar population parameters they describe. Here we use the Single\nStellar Population (SSP) models of Thomas, Maraston &\nBender (2003) with account for variable abundance ratios as\ncalculated by Korn, Maraston & Thomas (2005; hereafter we\nrefer to the Thomas et al. 2003 and Korn et al. 2005 models\ncollectively as TMB03). These models cover the metallicity\nrange \u22122.25\u2264[Z/H]\u22640.65 with ages from 1 to 15 Gyrs. The\n\n\f6\n\nMendel et al.\n\nvariable abundance ratios included by TMB03 consider N,\nO, Mg, Ca, Na, Si and Ti as enhanced elements and, while\nthese fall outside a strict definition of \u03b1-elements, we will\nhereafter refer to enhancement measures from the TMB03\nmodels as \u03b1-element abundances or [\u03b1/Fe].\nIt is well known that spectra are degenerate with respect to age and metallicity in so much as old, metal-rich\nand young, metal-poor stellar populations are remarkably\nsimilar. In order to minimise the influence of this degeneracy on our final measurements, we adopt the \u03c72 minimisation technique of Proctor et al. (2004), simultaneously fitting as many Lick indices as possible. This method has been\nshown to recover reliable ages, metallicities and \u03b1-element\nabundances in both galaxies (e.g. Proctor & Sansom 2002;\nBrough et al. 2007; Proctor et al. 2008) and globular clusters\n(Beasley et al. 2004; Pierce et al. 2006; Mendel et al. 2007).\nOur goal is to obtain a stable fit between our galaxy\ndata and the TMB03 models, and to accomplish this we\nadopt an iterative approach to our fitting. As a first step\nwe perform a fit using as many indices as our data allow,\ngenerally between 18 and 21. In subsequent iterations indices\ndeviant from the best-fit solution at the 5, 4 and 3 \u03c3 levels\nare clipped. A final, manual inspection of the fit is then\ncarried out to ensure that stable fits have been attained and\nthat indices have not been over- or under-clipped as a result\nof poor error estimates.\n\nFigure 2. Mean deviation of indices from the best fit TMB03\nSSP model. Open squares show the mean deviation for all indices\nin each galaxy, while filled circles show the mean deviation only\nfor indices included in the fits. (a) Galaxies with no detectable\nemission, (b) galaxies with visible emission in their spectra and (c)\nemission galaxies with spectra cleaned using the gandalf routine\n(see \u00a72.4).\n\nFigs. 2 and 3 show the mean deviation of indices from\nthe best fit model for AAOmega and 6dFGS data respectively. Galaxies free of emission are generally fit very well by\nthe TMB03 models and we clip at most 2 indices from any\ngiven galaxy. Emission-line galaxies are significantly more\ndifficult to fit, however the emission-cleaned spectra output\nfrom gandalf result in a large improvement to the overall quality of fits for AAOmega data (Fig 2b,c) and slight\nimprovement for 6dFGS data (Fig. 3b,c).\nFinal errors on our stellar population measurements are\nestimated using a Monte Carlo method which re-samples\nthe best-fit model convolved with our observed index errors.\nThese error estimates represent our best attempt to quantify\nthe random error contribution to our measurements, however there is an additional systematic error present in the\nmodels themselves which we do not account for (see, e.g.,\nConroy, Gunn & White 2008).\nThe 6dFGS and AAOmega spectra used in this work\ncan only be used to derive luminosity-weighted ages, metallicities and \u03b1-element abundances. This is important to\nany subsequent analyses as these luminosity-weighted values are particularly affected by small centralised bursts of\nstar formation and may not be representative of the global\ngalaxy properties. In addition, because of aperture size differences between AAOmega and 6dF (2.1\u2032\u2032 vs. 6.7\u2032\u2032 ; 0.3 kpc\nvs. 0.9 kpc at the distance of NGC 5044) we expect some\nvariation in the derived stellar population parameters due\nto both sampling differences and the presence of radial gradients, predominantly in metallicity. Final measurements of\nstellar population parameters (ages, metallicities etc.) and\ntheir associated errors for the 67 galaxies in our spectral\nsample are included in Appendix B.\n\nFigure 3. Same as Fig. 2, but for 6dFGS data. Data shown are\nwithout correction to the Lick/IDS system (see \u00a74.1).\n\n4.1\n\nComparison of AAOmega and 6dFGS\ngalaxies: agreement and aperture effects\n\nIn Fig. 4 we show the comparison of stellar population\nparameters derived for overlapping AAOmega and 6dFGS\ngalaxies. In this comparison we have used indices measured\nfrom 6dFGS data with no Lick/IDS system correction applied. Using indices adjusted using the AAOmega Lick/IDS\nsystem correction gives similar results, but with an increase\nin scatter. We therefore use uncorrected 6dFGS indices for\nthe remainder of this work.\nOf particular interest here is the comparison between\ngalaxy properties sampled using the different fibre apertures of AAOmega and 6dF. Perhaps the most obvious trend\nis observed in metallicity, which is also the most robust of\nour stellar population measurements. 6dFGS galaxies show\na systematic offset towards lower metallicities of \u223c0.1 dex,\nconsistent with observations that the majority of galaxies possess negative gradients in metallicity (i.e. galaxies\n\n\fNGC 5044 group stellar populations\n\n7\n\nFigure 4. Comparison of metallicity ([Z/H]), \u03b1-element abundance and age for the 6 overlapping 6dFGS and AAOmega galaxies with\nS/N > 12. Open (red) and filled (black) circles represent galaxies with and without emission lines. Dashed lines in each panel represent\nequality. Parameters for 6dFGS data are shown with no applied correction to the Lick/IDS system (see \u00a73.2).\n\nare more metal-poor at larger radii, e.g. S\u00e1nchez-Bl\u00e1zquez\net al. 2007; Brough et al. 2007).\nComparisons of \u03b1-element abundances and ages are\nconsiderably more scattered than metallicity, indicative of\nthe increased difficulty in their measurement. Broadly, we\nexpect the larger fibre aperture of 6dF to yield older ages,\nparticularly for galaxies with recent or currently ongoing\nstar formation as these bursts are (generally) centrally concentrated. We find this to be the case for half of the 6dFGS\ngalaxies, but the other half scatter to younger ages with\nconsiderable uncertainty. As these galaxies are just above\nour adopted S/N cut, we consider these measurements to be\nhighly uncertain rather than representative of a real trend\nin the data. We expect the variation in aperture size between AAOmega and 6dF to have little systematic effect on\nthe measured \u03b1-element abundances, as observed gradients\nin [\u03b1/Fe] are both weak and variable. In Fig. 4, \u03b1-element\nmeasurements using AAOmega data are consistently higher\nthan those from the 6dFGS data. Again, this is most likely\na S/N effect as the small dynamic range of \u03b1-element abundances makes their determination difficult in low S/N data.\nMotivated by the comparisons in Fig. 4 and the discussion above, in forthcoming sections we consider galaxy\nmetallicities to be robust for both the 6dFGS and AAOmega\nsamples. Age and \u03b1-element abundances for 6dFGS galaxies\ncan be used to give a rough indicator of stellar population\ntrends at larger group-centric radii (see \u00a76.1 and Paper I),\nbut we will refrain from using them to make any specific\njudgements due to the large uncertainty in their relationship to AAOmega data.\n\n5\n5.1\n\nGALAXY PROPERTIES\nStellar population parameters versus stellar\nmass\n\nBefore attempting to place our observed galaxy population\nin the context of the NGC 5044 group environment, we first\nexamine the properties of galaxies independent of their particular place in the group. In Fig. 5 we show how our measured ages, metallicities and \u03b1-element abundance vary with\nstellar mass (M\u2217 ). Stellar masses have been computed using\n\nFigure 5. Relationship between stellar population properties and\nstellar mass (see \u00a75.1). Filled (black) and open (red) symbols represent passive and emission-line galaxies (see \u00a72.4), with circles\nand triangles delineating galaxies measured using AAOmega and\n6dFGS spectra, respectively. Errors bars represent 1-sigma deviations estimated using the Monte Carlo technique described in\nSection 4.\n\n\f8\n\nMendel et al.\n\nGALEXEV stellar population synthesis models of Bruzual\n& Charlot (2003; hereafter BC03). Here we use BC03 models constructed using the \"Padova 1994\" isochrones (see\nBC03 and references therein) and stellar initial mass function (IMF) of Chabrier (2003). Using our derived central\nages and metallicities, we then extract the appropriate Bband mass-to-light ratio (M/L) from the BC03 models.\n\nOf the three stellar population parameters measured\nand shown in Fig. 5, metallicity shows the strongest correlation with mass, spanning more than two decades with\na scatter of \u223c0.26 dex. The general tightness of the mass\u2013\nmetallicity relation as determined from both emission- and\nabsorption-line analyses is well known from large samples such as the SDSS (e.g. Tremonti et al. 2004; Gallazzi\net al. 2006), however our data probe this relation an order\nof magnitude lower in both mass and metallicity. We see\nevidence for increased scatter among emission-line galaxies (\u223c 0.39 dex for emission-line galaxies vs. \u223c 0.23 dex for\npassive galaxies), which could be indicative of \"contamination\" from recently formed stellar populations, however\nthe fact that metallicities for low-mass emission-line galaxies\n(log M\u2217 <\n\u223c 9) appear depressed relative to their passive counterparts suggest that contamination is not playing a significant role, as recently formed populations should be metalenriched. Instead, the observed low metallicities (as well as\nincreased scatter) could be an effect of metal-enriched outflows in these galaxies, driven either by starbursts or supernovae, which could prevent the incorporation of metals into\nnewly-formed stars. We note, however, that measurements\nfor emission-line systems are also affected by the quality of\nour applied emission-line corrections, which would naturally\nlead to an increased scatter in absorption-line measurements\nin these systems.\n\nAn interesting question related to the mass\u2013metallicity\nrelation is the degree to which it depends on environment.\nWhile a detailed analysis of this dependence requires a\ncomparison of galaxies at fixed stellar mass in a range of\nenvironments, even a qualitative comparison of the massmetallicity relation in several different environments should\nallow identification of any gross systematic deviations. To\nthis end, we have selected a comparative sample of galaxies, both at higher and lower masses, in two other environments, the Local Group and the Shapley supercluster. Data\nfor Local Group dwarf galaxies are taken from the compilation of Woo, Courteau & Dekel (2008), who provide stellar\nmasses, derived using the colour-M\u2217 /L relation of Bell &\nde Jong (2001), and average [Z/H] from red giant branch\nstars. Metallicities for a sample of galaxies in the Shapley\nsupercluster have been calculated using Lick line index measurements from Smith et al. (2007) and the fitting methods\ndescribed in Section 4. Stellar masses for these galaxies have\nbeen estimated as described above, using B-band magnitudes from Smith et al. (2007). A comparison of the mass\u2013\nmetallicity relation for these three samples is shown in Fig.\n6. In this figure, metallicity estimates for Shapley supercluster galaxies have had additional offset of +0.15 dex applied\nto account for the different physical aperture size between\nNGC 5044 and Shapley observations (0.3 kpc vs. 1.9 kpc re-\n\nspectively)2 . Data shown in Fig. 6 form a remarkably uniform mass\u2013metallicity sequence over roughly six orders of\nmagnitude in galaxy stellar mass, despite the widely varied\nenvironments sampled. Furthermore, apart from the obvious\ndifferences in stellar mass range, the data suggest that environment is likely playing only a small role in establishing\nthe mass\u2013metallicity relation, consistent with recent results\nfrom the SDSS (e.g. Mouchine et al. 2007; van den Bosch\net al. 2007).\nInterpretations of the mass-metallicity relation generally focus around decreasing star-formation efficiency at\nlow masses, which can suitably explain the trends observed in galaxies (e.g. Tremonti et al. 2004; Savaglio\net al. 2005; Gallazzi et al. 2006) and is reproduced in hydrodynamic simulations including feedback mechanisms (e.g.\nBrooks et al. 2007). In this interpretation of the massmetallicity relation we expect to see low-mass galaxies trend\ntowards lower \u03b1-element abundances, as the relationship of\n\u03b1-element abundance to supernovae timescales, namely SNII\nversus SNIa contributions, provides leverage in separating\nbetween rapid, high-efficiency star formation and on-going,\nlow-efficiency star formation (e.g. Terlevich & Forbes 2002;\nThomas et al. 2005).\nExamining the observed relation of [\u03b1/Fe] with mass in\nFig. 5, we find considerable scatter, particularly in galaxies with emission. The majority of this scatter results from\nincreasingly large index errors at low S/N (see Appendix\nA), but there is also a systematic effect related to our\nfitting of low-mass, and hence low-metallicity, data. The\nTMB03 model grids \"pinch\" together at low [Z/H], making\nthe discrimination of [\u03b1/Fe] increasingly difficult (Mendel\net al. 2007). So, while we appear to observe significant\nscatter in the [\u03b1/Fe] measurements of low-mass galaxies,\nwhich would generally indicate significant variation in starformation histories, we are unable to draw any strong conclusions from these data. If we restrict ourselves to galaxies\nwith log M\u2217 >\n\u223c 8.5 M\u2299 , then our data exhibit a weak positive\ncorrelation of \u03b1-element enhancement with mass at the \u223c95\npercent level, consistent with the interpretation of the mass\u2013\nmetallicity relation as indicative of star-formation efficiency,\ndiscussed above.\nIn our age estimates we see a clear offset between\nemission-line and passive galaxies, unlike either metallicity\nor \u03b1-element abundance. The mean stellar age of emissionline galaxies is \u223c3.6 Gyrs, relative to \u223c9.1 Gyrs for passive\ngalaxies. We must, of course, interpret these age measurements with caution as they are strictly luminosity-weighted\nmeasurements within our fibre apertures. Emission-line\ngalaxies show a trend of younger central ages towards increasing mass, significant at the \u223c2\u03c3 level, which we believe\nto be largely driven by aperture effects and the centrally\nconcentrated nature of star formation. Analyses of central\nstellar populations in conjunction with global photometric\nmeasurements allow one to constrain the relative fraction of\nmass contained in central starbursts, which has been found\nto be of order 10 percent for a range of galaxy masses (e.g.\nP+08). If we consider the fact that the fraction of galaxy\nlight sampled by AAOmega's 2\u2032\u2032 aperture varies by more\n\n2\n\nAssuming an average metallicity gradient of -0.25 dex per dex,\ne.g. S\u00e1nchez-Bl\u00e1zquez et al. (2007)\n\n\fNGC 5044 group stellar populations\n\n9\n\nFigure 6. Mass\u2013metallicity relation for galaxies spanning a broad range of environments. Filled circles, open circles and open squares\nrepresent data from the NGC 5044 group, Local Group and Shapley supercluster respectively. Errors for the Local Group data are taken\nas the average error quoted in Woo et al. (2008) of 0.17 and 0.2 dex for stellar mass and metallicity. Errors on NGC 5044 group and\nShapley supercluster metallicities have been estimated using the Monte Carlo technique described in Section 4.\n\nthan an order of magnitude from the brightest to faintest\nsources in our sample, then the stellar population measurements for our most massive galaxies are almost completely\ndominated by any central star formation, while in smaller\ngalaxies we sample a growing fraction of the underlying, old\nstellar populations.\nThe passive sample of galaxies seems to separate into\ntwo sub-samples: one with relatively uniform, old ages\n(>\n\u223c 9 Gyrs), and a second population with relatively young\ncentral ages. This younger sub-sample almost certainly represents galaxies which have more recently undergone bursts\nof star formation and are now fading to older apparent ages.\nOne possible cause for this population could be recent, gasrich mergers which would serve to drive down central age\nmeasurements (e.g. Kauffmann 1996). In this scenario we\nwould expect to see these star-formation bursts accompanied\nby a decrease in \u03b1-element abundance as new generations of\nstars form from increasingly metal-enriched gas, however the\n\u03b1-element abundances for these galaxies are consistent with\nthe bulk of the passive galaxy population.\nTo summarise, the ages, metallicities and \u03b1-element\nabundances of galaxies in the NGC 5044 group are consistent with properties found in larger galaxy samples. The\ntight mass\u2013metallicity relation and its interpretation as a\nsequence of star-formation efficiency is consistent with our\nmeasurements of \u03b1-element abundance, although the trend\nof elemental abundance with mass appears relatively weak\nin these data.\n\n5.2\n\nThe age\u2013mass\u2013metallicity relation\n\nThe comparison of galaxy ages, metallicities and element\nabundances described in the previous section demonstrates\nthe close relationship between metallicity and stellar mass,\nbut it should also be considered that more complex relationships between multiple stellar population parameters and\nmass may exist. For example, in a study of local earlytype galaxies Trager et al. (2000) found that their ellipti-\n\ncal galaxies were described by two separate two-dimensional\nrelations in four-dimensional space: a plane described by\nthe linear combination of log t, log \u03c3 and [Z/H], and a relationship between [\u03b1/Fe] and log \u03c3 such that more massive galaxies have higher values of \u03b1-element enhancement.\nSmith et al. (2008b) found a similar relation between age,\nmass and metallicity for dwarf galaxies in the Coma cluster,\nnoting in particular an increase in scatter at low masses.\nMotivated by recent comparisons suggesting a tight relationship between the properties of galaxies at a fixed stellar mass (e.g. van den Bosch et al. 2008), we fit the plane\ndescribed by our data for age, mass and metallicity such\nthat\nlog M\u2217 = \u03b1 [Z/H] + \u03b2 log t + \u03b3,\n\n(1)\n\nusing a least-squares fitting method and minimising residuals orthogonal to the plane. The best-fitting parameters\nfor these data result in a plane such that \u03b1 = 1.83 \u00b1 0.46,\n\u03b2 = 1.41 \u00b1 0.79 and \u03b3 = 9.00 \u00b1 0.61. In Fig. 7 we show projections of this best-fit plane in stellar mass, M\u2217 , metallicity,\n[Z/H], and age. There is a clear separation between passive\nand emission-line galaxies about the fitted plane, which is\ndriven primarily by the difference in mean age of the two\npopulations and evident in Fig. 7c. The separation between\nthese two populations is inconsistent with being an effect of\nthe age\u2013metallicity degeneracy in our fits, which primarily\nmoves galaxies along the trends in Fig. 7. If we consider fits\nto the emission- and non-emission-line galaxies separately,\nboth populations show a similar dependence on stellar mass;\nthe offset between these two populations is dominated by a\nvarying age\u2013metallicity relation. Low-mass galaxies in our\nsample exhibit an increase in scatter about the fitted plane\nrelative to their high-mass counterparts, in agreement with\nthe observations of Smith et al. (2008b).\nThe projections shown in Fig. 7 are helpful to examine\nthe distribution of galaxy parameters relative to one another, but are somewhat difficult to interpret in physical\nterms. In Fig. 8 we show a more standard projection of the\n\n\f10\n\nMendel et al.\nmetallicity. This serves as an excellent confirmation in the\nreliability of M/L estimates for these galaxies which, to some\nextent, can be seen from the tightness of the mass-metallicity\nrelation in Fig. 5. The scatter in colours of emission line\ngalaxies is considerable, and the causes of this are likely to\nbe two-fold: firstly, we are sampling fundamentally different\nregions with our spectroscopy and photometry. Whereas this\nhas a negligible effect for passive galaxies, the centrally concentrated star-formation in our emission galaxies means that\nthe colours we predict should be, and indeed are, generally\nbluer than the observed \"global\" photometry. In addition,\nstellar population parameters derived for our emission-line\ngalaxies are the most uncertain, which leads to a greater uncertainty in both our measurements of ages and metallicities\nand hence a corresponding uncertainty in their predicted\ncolours. Overall, however, the above comparisons suggest\nthat our galaxy data are reasonably well described by the\nBC03 models.\n\n6\nFigure 8. Age\u2013metallicity relation for NGC 5044 group galaxies.\nSymbols are the same as in Fig. 5. Lines of constant stellar mass\nare shown for log M\u2217 = 8, 9, 10, 11 M\u2299 . Error bars are the 1-sigma\nerrors determined from Monte Carlo simulations (see \u00a74).\n\nplane in terms of age and metallicity, where dashed lines\nrepresent the age\u2013metallicity relation at fixed stellar mass\nas derived from the best-fit plane discussed above.\nIf we naively interpret the distribution of galaxy ages\nand metallicities shown in Fig. 8, then there is is little evidence for a relationship between central galaxy age and\nmetallicity; galaxies formed at a similar time in the early\nuniverse exhibit a spread in metallicity of two or more dex.\nHowever, our fits in the age\u2013mass\u2013metallicity plane suggest\nthat this is a flawed conclusion. While it is true to say that\nthere is no clear age\u2013metallicity trend when considering our\ntotal sample of galaxies, subsamples of data in narrow mass\nbins (one or two orders of magnitude) suggest that galaxies\nwith older central ages are more metal poor than centrally\nyoung galaxies, supporting evolution of the mass\u2013metallicity\nrelation over time (e.g. Kobulnicky et al. 2003; Brooks\net al. 2007; Lamareille et al. 2007; Maiolino et al. 2008).\n\n5.3\n\nPredicted vs. observed colours\n\nWhile up to this point we have used the BC03 models to derive M/L, and hence mass, for our galaxies, it is important\nto establish the extent to which these SSP models accurately describe the properties of our sample galaxies. To undertake this comparison we have supplemented the B\u2013 and\nK\u2013band photometry used in Paper I with B \u2212 V and g \u2212 i\ncolours for a subsample of NGC 5044 group dwarf galaxies\npresented by Cellone (1999) and Cellone & Buzzoni (2001;\n2005; S. Cellone, private communication). Predicted colours\nare calculated using the BC03 models and measured ages\nand metallicities. Comparisons of these predictions to our\nobserved colours are shown in Fig. 9.\nGalaxies lacking in emission show relatively good agreement with the predicted BC03 colour for their age and\n\nGLOBAL PROPERTIES AND GALAXY\nDISTRIBUTION\n\nWe have so far examined general trends in the galaxy population of the NGC 5044 group in their own right. We now\nturn to a more general discussion of the distribution of\ngalaxy properties within the group.\n6.1\n\nStellar population trends with radius\n\nBy combining semi-analytic models for star formation and\ngalaxy evolution with recent, large-scale N -body simulations\nsuch as the Millennium Simulation (Springel et al. 2005),\nrecent theoretical work has made great strides in predicting the distribution of galaxy properties in massive structures like groups and clusters. As an example, de Lucia\net al. (2006) found that the luminosity-weighted age, metallicity and stellar mass fall with increasing distance from\nthe cluster centre in their models, out to the virial radius.\nGiven the hierarchical formation scenario favoured in current \u039bCDM models these results are not surprising; those\ngalaxies in the highest density regions form first, and subsequent generations of galaxies accreted by the cluster are distributed with radius according to the redshift at which they\nbecome cluster members (e.g. Gao et al. 2004). It should\nbe noted, however, that there is considerable scope for the\ninterpretation of projected cluster-centric distance as an indicator of accretion time to be confused by three-body interactions which can eject bona fide members to beyond the\nvirial radius (see e.g. Ludlow et al. 2008).\nIn light of these predictions, we are motivated to examine the radial distribution of stellar populations in the\nNGC 5044 group. Galaxies residing in groups and clusters for\nmore than a dynamical time should undergo some degree of\nmass segregation due to the increasing efficiency of dynamical friction with total galaxy mass. In apparently relaxed\ngroups and clusters, such as NGC 5044, we expect any such\nsegregation to be readily apparent. In Paper I we examined\nthe distribution of dwarf and giant galaxies in the NGC 5044\ngroup using B-band magnitudes as a simple discriminator\nbetween low- and high-mass systems but found no significant evidence for differing radial distributions of these two\n\n\fNGC 5044 group stellar populations\n\n11\n\nFigure 7. Projections of the fitted plane to age, mass and metallicity. Symbols are the same as Fig. 5. Dashed lines represent equality\nand are shown for reference.\n\nFigure 9. BC03 predicted colours vs. observed global B \u2212K, B \u2212V and g \u2212i. Filled and open symbols represent passive and emission-line\ngalaxies respectively. Errors on predicted colours are calculated using the errors estimates on our central ages and metallicities. Dashed\nlines represent equality between the predicted and observed colours.\n\nsub-populations. Here, we are able to refine this analysis\nusing the stellar masses derived from the BC03 models.\nIn the upper panels of Fig. 10 we show the distribution\nof stellar mass, age, \u03b1-element abundance and metallicity in\nfixed radial bins. In the lower panels we show the radial distribution of galaxies in bins of stellar mass, age, \u03b1-element\nabundance and metallicity. This figure includes only those\ngalaxies within 500 kpc of the group centre (roughly twothirds the group's virial radius) as this is approximately the\nregion observed uniformly with our new AAOmega observations, and thus less prone to spurious, selection-induced\ntrends.\nFocusing first on the distribution of properties in fixed\nradial bins, we find no significant differences in the mean\nvalues for age or \u03b1-element abundance (shown by vertical\ndashed lines in the top panels of Fig. 10). Data show some\nevidence for a deviation in mean galaxy stellar mass and\nmetallicity, and a Kolmogorv-Smirnov (KS) test confirms\nthat metallicities in the inner 150 kpc of the group are inconsistent with being drawn from the same distribution as\neither of the outer two radial bins at the 2.5 sigma level.\nDespite the apparent offset in mean stellar mass, a KS test\ndoes not find galaxies in the inner group region to have a significantly different mass distribution relative to other radial\nbins.\n\nTurning to the radial distribution of galaxy properties (Fig. 10, lower panels), a KS test finds that both\nlow-mass and low-metallicity galaxies (log M\u2217 < 8.8 and\n[Z/H]< \u22120.7 dex) exhibit radial distributions that are different to their higher mass and metallicity counterparts. Qualitatively, these differences are evident in Fig. 10 by the clear\nlack of galaxies from the lowest mass and metallicity bins in\nthe inner 100 kpc of the group centre. The fact that we see\nthis segregation in both mass and metallicity is expected\nfrom the tight correlation between these two quantities in\nour data; the converse holds true for the lack of peculiar\ndistributions in age and \u03b1-element distributions given their\nlack of a strong correlation with mass.\nIn order to investigate the relationship between mass,\nmetallicity and radius further, in Fig. 11 we show galaxy\nmetallicities plotted against their group-centric radii, where\ngalaxies have been separated into three separate mass bins.\nThis figure serves as a visual confirmation of the mean offset\nof galaxy metallicity observed within \u223c150 kpc in Fig. 10,\nand also shows that this trend is due primarily to a lack of\nlow-mass, and hence low-metallicity, galaxies from the inner\n100 kpc of the group. Finally, Fig. 11 suggests that there are\nno strong radial trends in metallicity at fixed stellar mass.\nPrevious work by Mathews et al. (2004; hereafter\nM+04) using the NGC 5044 group catalogue of Ferguson\n\n\f12\n\nMendel et al.\n\nFigure 10. The radial dependence of various properties of galaxies in the NGC 5044 group. Top panels show the distribution of stellar\nmass, age, \u03b1-element abundance and metallicity in three different radial bins of R < 150 kpc, 150 kpc \u2264 R \u2264 250 kpc and R > 250 kpc\n(solid orange, green and blue hatched regions respectively). Vertical dashed lines show the mean of each bin. Lower panels show the\nradial distribution of galaxy properties in three separate bins of stellar mass, age, \u03b1-element abundance and metallicity, where bins have\nbeen selected to contain roughly equal numbers of galaxies.\n\n& Sandage (1990; hereafter FS90) has noted a similar lack\nof low-luminosity galaxies in the inner group region. Assuming dwarf galaxies act as tracer particles in the group\npotential, M+04 compared the cumulative number distribution of dwarf galaxies to the predicted surface mass distribution of a Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) dark matter profile\n(Navarro, Frenk & White 1995, 1996, 1997), finding that\nthe NGC 5044 group falls well below the NFW prediction\ninside \u223c300 kpc. M+04, and later Faltenbacher & Mathews\n(2005; hereafter FM05), offer two explanations for this apparent central deficit of dwarf galaxies. M+04 argue that a\nlack of dwarf galaxies could be tied to a low survival rate\nof low-mass galaxies entering the NGC 5044 group halo at\nhigh redshift (2 \u2212 3 \u2264 z \u2264 6), or due to suppression of star\nformation in low-mass galaxies as a result of AGN or outflow activity from the central galaxy. The follow-up work by\nFM05 showed, using a simple dynamical model, that tidal\ndisruption and dynamical friction could also be responsible\nfor the apparent lack of dwarfs at small radii. In their model,\nlow-mass galaxies approaching the central group potential\ncould be strongly disrupted or destroyed.\nOur sample has allowed us to refine the NGC 5044 group\nmembership used by M+04, and we find that limiting the\nFS90 group samples to only the spectroscopically defined\nmembers in Paper I does not significantly alter the conclusions of M+043 ; there still appears to be a deficit of dwarf\ngalaxies at low projected radii ( <\n\u223c 300 kpc). M+04 suggest\nthat, as a result of low dwarf galaxy survival rates at high\nredshifts, there should be a relative lack of old, low-mass\ngalaxies in the group. The data presented in Fig. 10 do not\nsuggest any such trend in galaxy ages, with low-mass galaxies appearing similar in mean age to their high-mass counterparts (see also Figs. 5 and 8). In addition, the M+04 scenario\nwould suggest that, relative to massive galaxies, low-mass\n3\n\nWhere the NFW profile is scaled to match the cumulative\ngalaxy distribution at \u223c350 kpc as in M+04\n\ndwarf galaxies should be kinematically \"younger\" in their\nvelocity distribution in the group; in Paper I we find no\nsuch evidence for kinematic segregation between high- and\nlow-luminosity galaxies. A repeat analysis of sub-population\nkinematics using the stellar masses derived in this work gives\na similar result, further suggesting that the scenario posed\nby M+04 does not describe these data in full.\nPerhaps the most plausible explanation is that put forward by FM05, where the apparent central deficit of dwarf\ngalaxies is a result of both dynamical friction and tidal disruption. In their work, FM05 find that the evolution of\ngalaxies with stellar to total mass ratios of \u223c20 best describe the population of disrupted galaxies in the NGC 5044\ngroup. Using the relationship between stellar mass and total\nbaryonic mass determined from fits to star-forming galaxies\nin the SDSS (Baldry, Glazebrook & Driver 2008), we can use\nthe cosmic baryon fraction, fb = 0.171 as determined from\nthe WMAP 5yr results (Komatsu et al. 2008) to estimate\nthe total halo mass for galaxies of a given stellar mass. For\nthe stellar-to-total mass ratio predicted by FM05 of 20, the\nabove above relation gives a corresponding stellar mass of\nlog M\u2217 \u2248 8.6. This is in agreement with the lower limit of\nstellar mass that we observe in the central 100 kpc of the\ngroup centre, providing support for the tidal disruption scenario of FM05.\nConfirmation of this would need to come from additional deep imaging to observe the low surface-brightness\nintragroup light which, given the possibly large number of\ndisrupted or destroyed dwarf galaxies, could be as much as\n\u223c35 percent of the group's total luminosity (FM05).\n\n6.2\n\nGalaxies and the hot intragroup medium\n\nThe metal content of the intracluster/intragroup medium\n(ICM/IGM) is directly related to the star formation histories of the galaxies via outflows and supernovae driven\nwinds, and therefore provides a useful diagnostic of both\n\n\fNGC 5044 group stellar populations\n\nFigure 11. Galaxy metallicity against projected group-centric\nradius. Galaxies are divided into three mass bins with approximately equal numbers such that circles, squares and triangles\nrepresent galaxies with log M\u2217 > 9.6, 8.8 \u2264 log M\u2217 < 9.6 and\nlog M\u2217 \u2264 8.8. Solid, dashed and dot-dashed lines represent the\nmean metallicity for each mass bin.\n\ngroup and galaxy evolution. Despite the presence of ongoing evolution in the stellar populations of group and cluster\ngalaxies, observations of high redshift X-ray samples suggest\nthat the bulk of ICM metals were already in place at z \u223c 1\n(e.g. Tozzi et al. 2003; Balestra et al. 2007) and therefore necessitate that most star formation activity and subsequent\nICM enrichment takes place at early times.\nRasmussen & Ponman (2007; hereafter RP07) have used\nChandra archival data to analyse the X-ray abundance properties of 15 nearby groups, including NGC 5044. From their\ndata RP07 extract radial profiles of iron and silicon abundance in the hot IGM out to \u223c 200 kpc in NGC 5044, facilitating a comparison between our galaxy stellar population\nmeasurements and the chemical properties of the intragroup\ngas. In Fig. 12 we plot the X-ray derived radial iron and silicon abundances along with the stellar mass-density profiles.\nIn their abundance analysis of hot gas in the NGC 5044\ngroup, RP07 show that the central silicon to iron ratio is\nroughly solar (i.e. [Si/Fe]\u223c 0.0), suggesting SNIa are playing an important role in enriching gas in the central group\nregions. While we lack significant overlap between the Xray profiles and our binned group profile, the slopes in both\niron and silicon abundance in the intragroup gas are consistent with that of the stellar mass density between 50 and\n\u223c100 kpc. In clusters, the central \"excess\" of iron in the\ncentral regions relative the rest of the ICM is normally attributed to enriched outflows from the central galaxy (e.g.\nB\u00f6hringer et al. 2004). In the case of NGC 5044 this remains\na plausible explanation for the high central iron abundance,\nparticularly given recent evidence for large outflows associated with NGC 5044's central AGN (Temi, Brighenti &\nMathews 2007; Gastaldello et al. 2007). We note, however,\nthat our data are also consistent with satellite galaxies having contributed significantly towards building up the central\niron peak in the group, particularly given the extended nature of the central excess, \u223c50 kpc, relative to the optical\nextent of NGC 5044 (\u223c20 kpc; FS90; Paturel et al. 2000;\nshown with black dashed line in Fig. 12) and the the good\ncorrespondence between the radial profile of iron abundance\nand stellar mass-density out to beyond \u223c100 kpc.\nIn the outer regions, R > 100 kpc, there is evidence\nfor a rising silicon abundance, in contrast to the iron abun-\n\n13\n\ndance which continues to fall. While the significance of this\nupturn is only marginal due to its dependence on the outermost measurement in the X-ray data, we have no reason to\nbelieve this is a spurious measurement. The observed rise in\n[Si/Fe] is in agreement with X-ray observations for numerous groups and clusters (e.g. Finoguenov et al. 2000; RP07)\nand suggests an increased contribution of SNII relative to\nSNIa at large projected radii.\nTo explore the relation between galaxies and the intragroup medium further, in Fig. 13 we show the same binned\nX-ray abundance profiles as in Fig. 12, only this time overlayed on the radial galaxy trends for metallicity and [\u03b1/Fe]\nshown in Fig. 11. This figure clearly shows that both the\nIGM iron abundance and the [Si/Fe] ratio are well below\nthe average values measured in galaxies at similar radii, despite both iron and silicon declining with radius at a similar\nrate to the stellar mass-density. On the other hand, lowmass galaxies generally exhibit stellar metallicities which\nfall below the measured IGM iron abundance at a given\nradius. Given the shallow potential wells of low-mass galaxies, metal-enhanced starburst or supernovae driven winds\nprovide a plausible explanation for the observed offset (see\nalso Section 5.1). Low-mass galaxies not withstanding, the\nobserved low chemical abundance of the IGM is consistent\nwith the findings of Buote, Brighenti & Mathews (2004),\nwho also note the low abundance of iron in the IGM relative to the group luminosity (compared to clusters), as well\nas other work suggesting a high fraction of \"primordial\" gas\nin the IGM (e.g. Gibson & Matteucci 1997; Moretti, Portinari & Chiosi 2003).\nIn terms of silicon abundance, we find a surprising correlation between the rise in [Si/Fe] at \u223c100 kpc and the presence of low-mass, dwarf galaxies at similar radii. If there is a\nconnection between these two observations, it would imply\na very high contribution of SNII relative to SNIa in dwarf\ngalaxies, as well as a significant contribution from these lowmass systems to the total gas mass of the group. Previous\nstudies, however, have shown that, while dwarf galaxies certainly contribute to the reservoir of intragroup gas, it is most\nlikely not significant, constituting at most 15% of the total\ngas mass in clusters (Gibson & Matteucci 1997). This suggests that the connection between these observations is likely\nonly coincidental, particularly given the relatively low IGM\niron abundance outside the group core, 10% solar, and the\nlikely sub-solar outflows from dwarf galaxies.\n\n7\n\nEMISSION LINE PROPERTIES\n\nUsing the sub-sample of our NGC 5044 group with measurable emission lines, we now discuss the emission-line characteristics of our group galaxies, including star-formation rates\nand nebular metallicities.\nFirst, in order to separate galaxies undergoing star\nformation activity from those with other strong ionising\nsources, i.e. AGN, we use a standard emission line diagnostic\ncomparing the [OIII]\u03bb5007 /H\u03b2 and [NII]\u03bb6584 /H\u03b1 flux ratios\n(Baldwin, Phillips & Terlevich 1981), shown in Fig. 14. We\nuse two predictions to characterise the emission line flux\nratios of our galaxies. The first is the theoretical maximum\nstarburst limit calculated by Kewley et al. (2001; dashed line\nin Fig. 14), while the second is the semi-empirical limit of\n\n\f14\n\nMendel et al.\n\nFigure 12. Comparison of stellar mass density (solid black line)\nand X-ray derived iron and silicon abundances (red dashed and\ndot-dashed lines respectively) as a function of radius.

The vertical dashed line\nrepresents the radial extent of NGC 5044's light profile of \u223c20 kpc.\n\nFigure 14. Line diagnostic for emission galaxies in our NGC 5044\ngroup sample. The solid and dashed lines represent the semiempirical pure star formation line from Kauffmann et al. (2003)\nand the theoretical maximum starburst line from Kewley\net al. (2001) respectively. Symbols represent galaxies which are\nlikely purely star-forming, AGN or composite AGN and starforming (circles, open triangles and open squares respectively).\n\n7.1\n\nFigure 13. Comparison of X-ray derived silicon and iron abundance profiles (dashed lines in each panel) with the distribution\nof galaxy \u03b1-element abundances and metallicities.

(2003) using a large sample of SDSS emission line galaxies (solid line\nin Fig. 14). These lines separate our sample into galaxies\nwhich are purely star-forming, strongly AGN or ionised by\na composite source (some contribution from both AGN and\nstar-formation), shown with circles, triangles and squares in\nFig. 14.\nNGC 5044 is known to host AGN activity (Rickes, Pastoriza & Bonatto 2004, Brough et al. 2007) and is identified\nas such in Fig. 14, but we also identify two other group\ngalaxies as hosts of potential AGN or other strong ionising\nsources: NGC 5037 (FS 068) and FS 082. The classification\nof these galaxies as AGN sources is supported by the available Chandra data, in which all three galaxies are detected.\n\nStar formation rate\n\nIn large samples, comparisons of galaxy properties with local environment show strong evidence for a decreasing fraction of star-forming galaxies in regions of higher projected\ngalaxy surface density (Lewis et al. 2002; G\u00f3mez et al. 2003;\nPoggianti et al. 2006). Even at relatively low gas densities,\nsuch as those found in groups, recent work has shown that\nram-pressure stripping can influence star-formation via depletion of a galaxy's hot-gas reservoir (Sivakoff et al. 2004;\nMachacek et al. 2005; Rasmussen et al. 2006; Kawata &\nMulchaey 2008). However in higher-density environments,\nsuch as the Coma cluster, Poggianti et al. (2004) have found\nevidence for young post-starburst galaxies preferentially located near the edges of X-ray substructures. These observations suggest that galaxy\u2013ICM interactions may play a key\nrole in the truncation of star formation, but may equally\ncontribute to initiating bursts of star formation in galaxies\nas they encounter dense environments.\nIn our own data, varying fibre throughput and sensitivity make proper flux calibration of our data difficult and\ntherefore limit our ability to derive absolute measurements\nof the star formation rate, SFR, using H\u03b1 line fluxes. Instead, we use the relation derived by Guzm\u00e1n et al. (1997)\nto estimate star formation rates using B-band luminosity\nand [OII] equivalent widths, where\nSFR(M\u2299 yr\u22121 ) \u2248 2.47 \u00d7 10\u221212 LB (L\u2299 ) EW[OII] .\n\n(2)\n\nWe use the B-band luminosities for galaxies as published in\nPaper I, which are taken from FS90 and Paturel et al. (2005).\nThe use of [OII] instead of H\u03b1 introduces an additional\nerror into the estimation of the star formation rate of order 0.2 to 0.3 dex (Kewley et al. 2004). The relation fit\nby Guzm\u00e1n et al. (1997) to convert between [OII] flux and\n\n\fNGC 5044 group stellar populations\n[OII] equivalent width carries with it increased uncertainty\nof \u223c0.1 dex in the derived SFR. Given these two relatively\nsignificant error contributions, in addition to the relatively\nlarge errors in the FS90 and Paturel et al. photometry (0.5\nand 0.3 dex respectively, see Paper I), we consider our star\nformation rates to only be proportional to the star formation activity in any given galaxy, but by no means a clear\nindicator of the absolute star formation rate.\nIn Fig. 15 we show the specific star formation rate for\ngalaxies as estimated using Eqn. 2 in relation to their projected radius from the group centre. The star formation rates\nshown in Fig. 15 have been normalised by the galaxy stellar\nmass and are shown in units of yr\u22121 per 109 M\u2299 . We see no\nclear correlation of SFR with radius, and results are similar if\nwe consider projected galaxy density. Motivated by the possible dependence of SFR on galaxy\u2013ICM/IGM interaction,\nwe have also examined the star formation rate relative to\na simple expression proportional to the IGM ram pressure,\nPram = \u03c1(r)|\u03bd\u0304group \u2212 \u03bd|2 , where \u03c1(r) is the IGM density and\n|\u03bd\u0304group \u2212\u03bd| is the galaxy velocity \u03bd relative to systemic group\nvelocity \u03bd\u0304group . Assuming that \u03c1(r) \u221d r \u22122 , we then arrive at\na comparison of SFR against |\u03bd\u0304group \u2212 \u03bd|2 /r 2 , which shows\na similar lack of correlation as the radial and galaxy density comparisons described above. We note that projection\neffects are likely having a strong effect on any of our radial\nSFR comparisons as we cannot properly relate our galaxy\npositions and recession velocities to their true position and\nrelative motion withing the group. Nevertheless, while these\ndata do not allow us rule out the role of interactions with\nintragroup gas as influencing the observed star formation\nin these galaxies, they seem to hint that these effects are\nrelatively limited in this case.\nAn alternative possibility for triggering or enhancing\nstar formation is through galaxy\u2013galaxy interactions. Hydrodynamic simulations modelling gas have shown that tidal\ninteractions can enhance or induce central star formation by\ndriving gas from the disk to the central regions (e.g. Barnes\n& Hernquist 1992; Di Matteo et al. 2007), which supports\nobservations of enhanced star formation in close pairs of\ngalaxies (e.g. Lin et al. 2007; Ellison et al. 2008). An examination of DSS images for the 22 galaxies with [OII] emission\nshows that only 2 galaxies, FS90 134 and FS90 137, exhibit clear evidence for ongoing interaction. Several other\ngalaxies show some evidence of disturbed morphology (i.e.\nboxy bulges and disturbed disks), however it appears that\nthe majority of recent star formation activity we see in the\nNGC 5044 group is not driven by currently ongoing galaxy\u2013\ngalaxy interactions.\n7.2\n\nEmission-line metallicity\n\nNebular metallicity and underlying, stellar metallicity are\nintimately related via star formation. The evolution of stellar\nmetallicity (as measured by absorption features) is strictly\ndependent on a galaxy's star formation history, while nebular metallicities continue to vary as previous generations\nof stars evolve and enrich the interstellar medium. We are\ntherefore able to use the relative offset of emission- and\nabsorption-line metallicities to extract information related\nto the last significant star formation episode. Here we use\na reparameterisation of the Kewley & Dopita (2002; hereafter KD02) R23 method presented by Kobulnicky & Kew-\n\n15\n\nFigure 15. Specific star formation rate as it varies with projected\ndistance from the group centre. Errors are indicative of the uncertainty in our EW[OII] and B-band luminosity measurements, but\ndo not include the systematic contribution from using [OII] over\nH\u03b1 and equivalent widths as opposed to line fluxes (see \u00a77.1).\n\nley (2004; hereafter KK04) to derive gas-phase metallicities\nfor a subsample of our emission-line galaxies. We exclude\nfrom this analysis galaxies exceeding the maximum starburst\nlimit shown in Fig. 14 as likely hosting AGN (NGC 5044,\nNGC 5037 and FS 082).\nThe R23 metallicity calibrator is typically defined using emission line fluxes, however this requires spectra to be\nproperly flux calibrated as line ratios spanning a significant\nwavelength range will otherwise be incorrect. An alternate\napproach is to use measurements of equivalent width in place\nof line fluxes to compute EW-R23 , which avoids the issues\nof flux calibration and extinction correction, but introduces\nthe problem of potential variation in the underlying stellar\ncontinua (particularly between old and young spectra). In\na statistical sense, the variation between R23 and EW-R23\nresults in an an additional error on the final metallicity determination of \u223c0.11 dex (Kobulnicky & Phillips 2003), however in our relatively small sample where we know the underlying stellar populations vary significantly, the uncertainty\nbetween R23 and EW-R23 can have a potentially significant\neffect on our results. Considering both the wide range of\nspectra types and uncertain flux calibration of our data, we\nestimate nebular metallicities using both R23 and EW-R23 .\nSince the effects of varying stellar continua and flux calibration affect emission-line metallicity measurements differently, by using both of these measurements we can assess\nthe reliability of our conclusions.\nComparison of EW-R23 and R23 shows that the scatter between the two measures is \u223c0.08 dex, or \u223c0.11 dex in\nterms of the final determination of 12 + log(O/H) (Kobulnicky & Phillips 2003), which is generally less than the\nintrinsic error in the calibration of R23 to nebular oxygen\nabundance. In our own data, the scatter between EW-R23\nand R23 is \u223c 0.16 dex, but this scatter is primarily driven\nby two galaxies with significant offsets between EW-R23 and\nR23 . Excluding these galaxies the scatter on our data falls to\n\u223c0.07 dex. We therefore exclude these deviant galaxies from\nthe remainder of our emission line analyses and consider\nmeasurements on the remaining galaxies to be reliable.\nComparison of stellar and nebular metallicities is carried out by converting nebular oxygen abundances to the\nimplied metal mass fraction using the relation Z \u2243 29 \u00d7\n\n\f16\n\nMendel et al.\n\n10[12+(O/H)]\u221212 , assuming the standard solar abundance distribution and solar oxygen abundance of 12 + (O/H) = 8.72\n(Allende Prieto, Lambert & Asplund 2001; Kobulnicky &\nKewley 2004). In Fig. 16 we show the comparison between\nthe converted nebular metallicities and stellar metallicity.\nWe find that, in general, derived nebular metallicities are\nsuper-solar, and in some cases nearly 1 dex higher than their\nstellar counterparts. The relatively shallow relation between\nstellar and nebular metallicities is somewhat puzzling, as\nit implies a significantly weaker mass-metallicity relation\namong star-forming galaxies than is generally observed (e.g.\nTremonti et al. 2004).\nGiven this somewhat curious result we are motivated to\nexamine the relative difference between nebular and stellar\nmetallicity as a function of other galaxy properties. In Fig.\n17, the relative offset between nebular and stellar metallicity is plotted against galaxy stellar mass, age and \u03b1-element\nabundance. The relationship between metallicity offset and\nstellar mass in Fig. 17 is driven primarily by the mass\u2013\nmetallicity relation and shows that the most massive galaxies have the lowest measured nebular\u2013stellar metallicity offsets as a result of the relatively uniform, high nebular metallicities measured.\nIn terms of age, those galaxies with the lowest metallicity offsets also have the youngest luminosity-weighted ages,\nwhich is consistent with the observed stellar population\nforming recently from gas present in these galaxies. Interestingly, while the trend of metallicity offset with age is\nconsistent with our understanding of galaxy formation, the\nmagnitude of this offset is large, nearly 1.5 dex in the case\nof the lowest-mass galaxies. This offset is difficult to explain\nthrough pure passive evolution of the stellar populations in\nthese galaxies, i.e. through enrichment from SNII and SNIa,\nwhich in extreme cases can account for \u223c1 dex of metallicity increase (see, e.g. Sansom & Proctor 1998). An alternate\nexplanation is that ongoing star formation has helped to enhance the observed gaseous metallicities through the evolution of metal-enriched stars. In this case the integrated stellar populations should also appear both younger and more\nmetal rich in those galaxies hosting the largest nebular\u2013\nstellar metallicity offsets, in conflict with the trends in Fig.\n17. Finally, these data could be explained in a scenario where\nthe gas reservoirs of low-mass galaxies are being preferentially depleted over high-mass galaxies, which would increase\nthe effect of any subsequent enrichment due to supernovae.\nIn order to explain these observations in terms of gas\nremoval, we require that the removal process must be more\nefficient in low-mass galaxies, ruling out AGN activity as\na possibility due to its strong scaling with mass. Starburst\noutflows, primarily driven by SNII, satisfy the above stated\nmass dependence but would also likely affect the observed\n[\u03b1/Fe] ratio of stars formed from any remaining gas, in\nconflict with Fig. 17c. Galaxy\u2013IGM interactions such as\nram-pressure stripping (Gunn & Gott 1982) and viscous\nstripping (Nulsen 1982) satisfy both the inverse mass dependence and non-preferential gas removal (i.e. gas-phase\nmetals from SNII and SNIa must be removed more-or-less\nequally) stipulated by these observations. Strictly speaking, we cannot rule out any processes from contributing to\nthe observed galaxy processes, however our data are best\nexplained by galaxy\u2013IGM dominating gas removal in the\nNGC 5044 group.\n\nFigure 16.

The dashed line represents equality\nbetween the nebular and stellar metallicities.\n\n8\n\nDISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nIn this second of two papers, we have undertaken a spectroscopic investigation of galaxies in the group environment, deriving stellar masses, ages, metallicities and \u03b1-element abundance ratios for 67 of the 111 spectroscopically confirmed\nNGC 5044 group members described by Mendel et al. (2008).\nThese measurements have allowed us to examine the star\nformation histories of these group members, both as a population in their own right and in the context of the group\nenvironment and their location in it.\nThe mass\u2013metallicity relation plays a fundamental role\nin describing galaxy populations, and we see strong evidence\nof this in the overall tightness of the mass\u2013metallicity relation in our group data over multiple orders of magnitude\nin stellar mass. In the context of environment, by comparing the mass\u2013metallicity relation of NGC 5044 group galaxies with galaxies in the local group and the Shapley supercluster, we show that galaxies appear to form a continuous\nmass\u2013metallicity relation across several orders of magnitude\nin system mass and spanning upwards of six orders of magnitude in galaxy stellar mass. These data argue for a relative\nindependence of the mass-metallicity relation from environment (e.g. Maiolino 2008; van den Bosch et al. 2008).\nIn terms of galaxy ages and \u03b1-element abundances, we\nfind no evidence for strong trends with galaxy mass. Our\n\u03b1-element abundance data do not rule out the interpretation of star formation efficiency as the primary driver of\nthe mass\u2013metallicity relation. Particularly at higher stellar\nmasses (log M\u2217 >\n\u223c 9 M\u2299 ) and metallicities, where wide separation of model grids allow for finer abundance measurements, our data show hints of a trend of increasing \u03b1-element\nratio with mass, consistent with literature results (e.g. Terlevich & Forbes 2002; Thomas et al. 2005). We have shown\nthat the surface described simultaneously by age, mass and\nmetallicity is vital to analyses of galaxy data spanning a\nbroad range in mass. Most notably, mass dependence is vital to interpretation of the galaxy age\u2013metallicity relation.\nIn terms of the galaxy radial distribution, we find no\napparent radial dependence in either age or \u03b1-element abun-\n\n\fNGC 5044 group stellar populations\n\n17\n\nFigure 17. Offset between nebular and stellar metallicity plotted against stellar mass, age and \u03b1-element abundance.\n\ndances. A KS test finds that low-mass and low-metallicity\ngalaxies have radial distributions inconsistent with their\nhigh-mass and high-metallicity counterparts, and an examination of this apparent difference shows that we observe no\ngalaxies with log M\u2217 <\n\u223c 8.9 M\u2299 within \u223c100 kpc projected radius from the group centre. In the context of previous analyses of the NGC 5044 group, M+04 and FM05 have both\nnoted the apparent lack of dwarf galaxies in the group's central regions using the photometric catalogue of FS90. Our\nspectroscopic observations confirm that the dwarf galaxy\ndistribution observed by M+04 and FM05 is not due to\nthe inclusion of significant foreground or background contamination in the FS90 catalogue (see Paper I). Of the possible scenarios for explaining this deficit, the most plausible seems to be that dwarf galaxies are being tidally disrupted or destroyed through interactions with the group or\ncentral galaxy potential. Our data are consistent with the\nsimulations of FM05 in their prediction of stellar-to-total\nmass ratios for disrupted galaxies of \u223c 20, corresponding\nto \u223c log M\u2217 \u2248 8.6. Deep wide-field imaging is required\nto confirm this conclusion, as the models of FM05 predict\nstars from the disrupted population of dwarf galaxies to contribute nearly 35 percent of the total group luminosity, consistent with estimates of intracluster light for other groups\nat a similar mass (e.g. Gonzalez, Zaritsky & Zabludoff 2007).\nWith regard to similar types of analyses on other groups\nand clusters, Coma is the only cluster analysed to a similar depth with stellar population measurements. Smith\net al. (2008a) have examined radial gradients of Coma cluster dwarf galaxies, finding strong trends towards younger\nages and higher metallicities with increasing cluster-centric\nradii. While these results are at odds with our own, we believe this disagreement to be largely driven by the galaxy\nselection employed by Smith et al. (2008a). The trends observed by Smith et al. (2008a) are consistent with the interpretation that the south-west \"infall\" region of Coma\nhas already undergone a passage through the cluster centre.\nObservations of younger ages and higher metallicities in a\n\"quenched\" dwarf population would then be consistent with\nthe idea of induced star formation from galaxy encounters\nwith the dense/hot IGM (e.g. Poggianti et al. 2004). The\nfact that we do not see such a trend would seem to suggest\nthat we either fail to measure galaxies at sufficient radii to\n\nsee effects of induced star formation in our galaxies, or that\nsuch dramatic interactions are not occurring within the central regions we probe here. It is worth noting that in Paper\nI we identified a possible infalling substructure to the northeast of NGC 5044 at \u223c1.4 Mpc projected separation, but our\nstellar population measurements do not extend that far and\nso we are unable to comment on possible trends at these\nlarge radii.\nWhile we do not see any obvious trends of stellar populations with radius, as Smith et al. do, we do perhaps find a\nmore subtle interpretation of galaxy evolution in the group\nenvironment through analysis of emission-line properties.\nComparison of emission- and absorption-line metallicities\nhas allowed us to extract information regarding the previous star-formation episodes of galaxies through the relation\nof nebular and stellar metallicities. What we find is that\nthe relative offset between these two metallicity estimates\nis too large to be explained by either pure passive evolution of galaxies, which can account for at most \u223c 1 dex of\noffset, or ongoing star formation, which is inconsistent with\nother observed galaxy properties. The mass-dependence of\nour emission\u2013absorption metallicity offset instead is consistent with a scenario in which galaxies are being stripped of\ntheir gas primarily through galaxy\u2013IGM interactions, and\ntherefore subsequent ISM enrichment is having a larger effect on the observed emission-line metallicity. We require a\nlarger sample of galaxies to confirm such an analysis, however this method provides a novel technique for probing environmental effects on galaxy evolution.\nWe turn, finally, to the question of NGC 5044's evolution as a group and what information the galaxy population\nholds in this regard. The relative lack of radial trends in the\nstellar population data limit the extent to which the gradual\naccretion scheme present in semi-analytic models of group\nformation (e.g. de Lucia et al. 2006; Berrier et al. 2008) can\nbe acting in the NGC 5044 group, at least without considerable mixing of the galaxy distribution with radius (e.g. Ludlow et al. 2008). The large peculiar velocity of NGC 5044 itself relative to the group mean (\u223c 200 km s\u22121 ), possible presence of substructure on the outer regions of the group (see\nPaper I) and recent detection of a \"sloshing\" type cold front\nin the group's X-ray distribution (Gastaldello et al. 2008)\nsuggest that the group is still growing and in the process\n\n\f18\n\nMendel et al.\n\nof relaxation. However, the group's Gaussian line-of-sight\nvelocity distribution and relatively uniform X-ray profiles\nargue against any recent, dynamically violent evolution of\nthe group.\nThe work presented here represents the first targeted\neffort at constraining the stellar population trends of group\ngalaxies. Further work is clearly needed, particularly on\nlarger samples of homogeneously selected galaxies, to better\nconstrain the processes driving galaxy evolution in groups.\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nThe authors would like to thank the anonymous referee for\nhis/her helpful comments and suggestions.
