A star product is a R[[t]] linear associative product\non \u00c3, defined for f, g \u2208 A by\nf \u2217 g = gf +\n\n\u221e\nX\n\ntk ck (f, g),\n\nk=1\n\nwhere ck (f, g) are bidifferential operators.\n1\n\n\fThe star product is a basic object of the deformation quantization [1]. A\nformula for the star product on an arbitrary Poisson manifold was found by\nKontsevich [2]. For symplectic Poisson manifolds one can also use Fedosov's\nconstruction of deformation quantization [3].\nThe star product for linear Poisson structures [4] can be derived from the\nBaker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) formula [5]. It is different from Kontsevich's product being a part of the last one.\nIn the present paper an expansion of the star product in powers of the\nderivatives of Poisson structure is studied. We find the explicit expression\nwhich defines a second order deformation in the derivative expansion.This\nexpression is given by an infinite series in variable t as well as in the number\nof first order derivatives of \u03c9 ij . It is based on the BCH formula for the\nPoisson bracket algebra (1).\nThe paper is organized as follows. In the next section we introduce notations and rewrite the associativity equation in the form which is convenient\nfor our purposes. In Sec.3 we define an infinite-dimensional Lie group associated with the Poisson bracket algebra (1). In Sec. 4 we show that the\ncorresponding BCH series defines a second order deformation quantization\nin the derivative expansion.\n\n2\n\nDerivative expansion\n\nFor any f, g \u2208 A the star product can be computed by the equation\nf (x) \u2217 g(x) = f (\n\n\u2202\n\u2202\n)g( )eQ(\u03b1*x,\u03b2*x)|\u03b1=\u03b2=0 ,\n\u2202\u03b1 \u2202\u03b2\n\n(2)\n\nwhere \u03b1 * x = \u03b1i xi , \u03b1i \u2208 R, and\neQ(\u03b1*x,\u03b2*x) = e\u03b1*x \u2217 e\u03b2*x .\nThe associativity equation for the star product reads\n(f \u2217 g) \u2217 h = f \u2217 (g \u2217 h)\n\n(3)\n\nfor all f, g, h \u2208 \u00c3.

Therefore G can be treated as a deformation of R\u0302N .\n\n4\n\nA second order deformation in the derivative expansion\n\nLet us define the R[[t]] linear product on \u00c3\nf (x) \u22c4 g(x) = f (\n\n\u2202\n\u2202\n\u2032\n)g( )eH (\u03b1*x,\u03b2*x) |\u03b1=\u03b2=0 .\n\u2202\u03b1 \u2202\u03b2\n\nIt can be also written in the form\n\u2202\n\n\u2202\n\nf (x) \u22c4 g(x) = eM ( \u2202\u03be *x, \u2202\u03b7 *x) f (\u03be)g(\u03b7)|\u03be=\u03b7=x,\nwhere\nM(f, g) = H \u2032(f, g) \u2212 f \u2212 g\nFor the Poisson bracket with constant \u03c9 ij\nM(\n\n\u2202\n\u2202\nt\n\u2202 \u2202\n* x,\n* x) = \u03c9 ij i j .\n\u2202\u03be\n\u2202\u03b7\n2 \u2202\u03be \u2202\u03b7\n\nIn this case (8) reproduces the Groenewold-Moyal product\nt\n\nf (x) \u22c4 g(x) = e 2\n\n\u03c9 ij\n\n\u2202\n\u2202\n\u2202\u03bei \u2202\u03b7 j\n\n5\n\nf (\u03be)g(\u03b7)|\u03be=\u03b7=x.\n\n(8)\n\n\fProduct (8) coincides also with the star product for linear Poisson structures\n[5].\nExpanding (8) in powers of t one gets\nt\nt2\nf \u22c4 g = f g + \u03c9 ij \u2202i f \u2202j g + \u03c9 ij \u03c9 kl \u2202i \u2202k f \u2202j \u2202l g+\n2\n8\nt2\n+ \u03c9 ij \u2202j \u03c9 kl (\u2202i \u2202k f \u2202l g \u2212 \u2202k f \u2202i \u2202l g) + O(t3 ).\n12\nThis means that (8) defines a second order deformation in the variable t\n[2, 7].\nTHEOREM Formula (8) gives a second order deformation of A in the\nderivative expansion.\nProof. Let l(x) be a Lie series in xi . It can be written as\nl(x) = \u03b1 * x +\n\n\u221e\nX\n\n\u03b1i1 i2 ...in {xin , . . . , {xi2 , xi1 }}\n\nn=2\n\nfor some \u03b1i1 i2 ...in \u2208 R. One checks that\nl(x + a) = l(x) + \u2202i l(x)ai + O(\u2202 2 \u03c9)\n\n(9)\n\nand for any function f (x)\n{l(x), f (x)} = {\u2202i l(x)xi , f (x)} + O(\u2202 2 \u03c9).\n\n(10)\n\nFrom this it follows\nH \u2032 (l(x), \u03b3 * x) = l(x) + \u03b3 * x + M(\u2202i l(x)xi , \u03b3 * x) + O(\u2202 2 \u03c9). (11)\nLet us compute the left-hand side of equation (4) for Q(\u03b1 * x, \u03b2 * x) =\nH \u2032 (\u03b1 * x, \u03b2 * x). Using (9) and (11) one gets\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\neH (\u03b1*x,\u03b2*x) |x= \u2202 eH (\u03c0*x,\u03b3*x) |\u03c0=0 = eH (\u03b1*x,\u03b2*x) |x=x+ \u2202 e\u03b3*x+M (\u03c0*x,\u03b3*x)|\u03c0=0 =\n\u2202\u03c0\n\n\u03b3*x+H \u2032 (\u03b1*x,\u03b2*x)+M (\u2202i H \u2032 (\u03b1*x,\u03b2*x)xi ,\u03b3*x)\n\n=e\n\n\u2202\u03c0\nH \u2032 (H \u2032 (\u03b1*x,\u03b2*x),\u03b3*x))\n\n2\n\n+O(\u2202 \u03c9) = e\n\n+O(\u2202 2 \u03c9).\n(12)\n\nBy similar computations of the right-hand side of (4) we obtain\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\neH (\u03b2*x,\u03b3*x) |x= \u2202 eH (\u03b1*x,\u03c0*x)|\u03c0=0 = eH (\u03b1*x,H (\u03b2*x,\u03b3*x)) + O(\u2202 2 \u03c9).\n\u2202\u03c0\n\n6\n\n(13)\n\n\fFrom (12),(13) and (6) it follows that H \u2032(\u03b1 * x, \u03b2 * x) satisfies equation (4)\nmodulo O(\u2202 2 \u03c9). This means that\n(f \u22c4 g) \u22c4 h = f \u22c4 (g \u22c4 h) + O(\u2202 2 \u03c9)\nfor all f, g, h \u2208 \u00c3.\n\n5\n\nConclusion\n\nIn the present article we have constructed the Lie group associated with a\nPoisson bracket algebra. We have found that the corresponding BCH series\ndefines a second order deformation of Poisson manifolds in the derivative\nexpansion.\nIt would be interesting to find a third order deformation. It defines a\ndeformation of quadratic Poisson structures.\n\nReferences\n[1] F.Bayen,M.Flato,C.Fronsdal,A.Lichnerovich,D.Sternheimer,\n111 (1978) 61 .\n\nAnn.Phys.\n\n[2] M.Kontsevich, Lett.Math.Phys. 66 (2003) 157 .\n[3] B.Fedosov, J.Diff.Geom. 40 (1994) 213 .\n[4] S.Gutt, Lett.Math.Phys.7 (1983) 249 .\n[5] V.Kathotia, Kontsevich's universal formula for deformation quantization\nand the Campbell-Baker-Hausdorff formula,I, math.QA/9811174.\n[6] N.Bourbaki, Groupes et algebres de Lie (Hermann,Paris, 1971,1972).\n[7] M.Penkava, P.Vanhaecke, Deformation quantization of polynomial Poisson algebras, math.QA/9804022.\n\n7\n\n\f"}
