A number of novel phenomena associated with\nthe transition such as the quantum critical behavior have\nbeen observed in a variety of condensed matter materials\n[1, 2]. One of the prototype model systems exhibiting the\nquantum phase transition is the one-dimensional spin-1/2\nIsing lattice with a transverse field, namely the transverse\nIsing model (TIM)[3, 4, 5], defined by\nX\n\u0001\nz\nJSjz Sj+1\n\u2212 hSjx ,\n(1)\nHT IM = \u2212\nj\n\n~j is the spin operator at the site j on a onewhere S\ndimensional lattice of length L. The transverse field\nh introduces quantum fluctuation to the system, leading to a quantum phase transition from the ferromagnetic/antiferromagnetic ordered to the paramagnetic disordered states above a critical value hc = J/2. Actually\nthe model is equivalent to a free spinless fermion system\nand can be exactly solved by applying the Jordan-Wigner\ntransformation[6, 7]. Based on the exact solution, all\nphysical quantities, including the ground state energy,\nthe low-energy excitations, the specific heat and other\nthermodynamic functions can be evaluated. This provides a thorough understanding of the quantum critical\nbehavior of this system.\nHowever, in real materials, the moments of atoms may\nbe larger than 1/2. Despite of immense efforts in the\npast three decades it is still very difficult to find exact\nsolutions of the S = 1 or other higher spin quantum\nIsing systems. This is partly due to the existence of the\nspin neutral states S z = 0 (called as holes hereafter) in\naddition to the two spin polarized states S z = \u00b11 at\neach site in the S = 1 spin chain. In these models, a\nhole can decay into a pair of polarized spin states, and\nvice verse, thus rendering the Jordan-Winger approach\ninvalid in exactly solving the S = 1 TIM.\nIn this paper, we study a class of one-dimensional\n\nS = 1 quantum Ising model, defined by the following\nHamiltonian\nX\n\u0001\nz\n(2)\n+ fj .\nJj Sjz Sj+1\nH=\u2212\nj\n\nWhere, fj = Djx (Sjx )2 + Djy (Sjy )2 + Djz (Sjz )2 is the singleion anisotropy term with site-dependent Dj\u03b1 (\u03b1 = x, y, z).\nThe above model has a classical limit where Djx = Djy .\nThis corresponds to the Blume-Capel model[8]. So the\npresent model can be regarded as the quantum generalization of the Blume-Capel model. The simplest quantum case is the uniform chain defined by[9]\nX\u0002\n\u0003\nz\n(3)\nJSjz Sj+1\n+ D(Sjx )2 .\nHQIM = \u2212\nj\n\nIn two or higher dimensions, this kind of quantum\nIsing model with single-ion anisotropy was studied by\na number of authors, based mainly on the mean-field\napproximations[10, 11]. In particular, the ground state\nof the model (3) was shown to be equivalent to the\nS = 1/2 TIM defined by Eq. (1) [12]. Such equivalence\nis also valid for quantum Ising models with bond- and\nsite-alternations[13] or geometrical frustrations, such as\na fully frustrated spin-1 Ising Delta-chain[14].\nThe purpose of the present paper is to study the physical properties of the model described by Eq. (2) based on\nthe exact solution. The key idea in solving the proposed\nS = 1 model is to divide the total Hilbert space of the\nS = 1 system into a number of subspaces labeled by the\nnumber of holes. This is what we call the hole decomposition scheme (HDS). This HDS was developed in our\nrecent work [9] where a recursion approach based on the\nHDS is suggested for the uniform chain. In the present\npaper, we shall give more comprehensive investigations\nfor various properties of the S = 1 model, including the\ncase with dimerization [15]. In particular, we show that\nfor a given hole configuration, each sub-lattice system\nwith purely polarized spins can be exactly solved in that\ncase. Based on the exact solution we study how the quantum phase transitions and thermodynamic properties are\n\n\f2\naffected by the interplay between the dimerization and\nthe single-ion anisotropy. Depending on the strength of\ndimerization, we find that the system undergoes a quantum phase transition where the criticality is the same as\nthat of the uniform S = 1/2 TIM.\nWe note that the spin-1/2 TIM can be realized in certain low-dimensional magnetic materials [16, 17]. For the\nsystems with local moments larger than 1/2, the singleion anisotropy generated by crystal fields and the dimerization may also become important[18]. The S = 1 TIM\nwith the crystal field splitting was used to describe the\nferroeletric transition in SrTiO3 [19]. In a class of quasione dimensional spin chains, such as [Ni2 (Medpt)2 (\u03bdox)(H2 O)2 ](ClO4 )2 *H2 O, the magnetic Ni2+ ion shows\nnot only a single-ion anisotropy[20, 21], but also a S =\n1 bond-alternating pattern, where Medpt is the bis(3aminopropyl) methylamine[22, 23]. Recently, cold atoms\nor polar molecules in optic lattices were shown to be\nideal systems to realize various quantum spin models[24].\nIn particular, the spin-1 models can be implemented\nby trapping polar molecules where the spin degrees of\nfreedom can be described by the hyperfine vibrational\nstates[25].\nThis paper is organized as follows. In Sec.II and\nSec.III, we discuss some general properties of the model\nand introduce the HDS. In Sec.IV, we solve exactly the\nHamiltonian in the presence of dimerization. In Sec.V,\nwe study the low energy excitation spectra and quantum\nphase transitions based on the exact solutions. In Sec.VI,\nwe discuss in detail the recursion method introduced in\nRef. [9] for evaluating thermodynamic quantities. Finally, we give a summary in Sec. VII.\nII.\n\nHOLE DECOMPOSITION SCHEME\n\nLet us consider a S=1 Ising lattice with single-ion\nanisotropy, defined by Eq. (2). (Sjx , Sjy , Sjz ) are the\nS = 1 spin operators at lattice site j = 1, 2, ..., L,\nwith the lattice length L. The uniform classical BlumeCapel model[8] corresponds to the symmetric case with\nDjx = Djy = D. Because only two of these Dj\u03b1 terms\nare independent, we shall mainly consider the quantum\ncase with Djx = Dj and Djy = Djz = 0, without losing\ngenerality. The case with Djz 6= 0 will be discussed later.\nWe shall mainly focus on the dimerization case where\nJ2j\u22121 = J1 , J2j = J2 , D2j\u22121 = D1 , D2j = D2 .\nBy definition, one has\n\n(Sjx )2\n\n=\n\n+ +\n1\n4 (Sj Sj\n\n(4)\n\nlowing theorem:\nTheorem 1. When S = 1, the total hole number operaPL\ntor N\u03020 = L\u2212 j=1 (Sjz )2 commutes with the Hamiltonian\nfor any site-dependent Jj and Dj\n[N\u03020 , H] = 0.\n\nH = H0 \u2295 H1 \u2295 * * * \u2295 HL .\n\n(6)\n\nA complete set of the eigenstates in the p-th sector forms\na sub-band of the whole spectrum. Generally the lowest\neigen-energy of the p-sector satisfies the following theorem:\nTheorem 2. Let E(p, L) be the eigen-energy, corresponding to the eigenstate |p, Li of H, and E0 (p, L) be\nthe lowest eigen-energy in the p-th sector, then the following inequality holds\nE0 (p, L) < E0 (p + 1, L).\n\n(7)\n\nThis relationship is an extension of the Lieb-Mattis\nTheorem derived initially for the uniform systems with\nferromagnetic Ising couplings[26]. It holds still no matter whether the Ising couplings are ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic. It indicates that in the absence of the\nDjz -term the ground state always lies in the p = 0 sector\nand the energy spectrum of the system has a hierarchy\nstructure.\nThere are two kinds of excitations in the system. One\nis the fermionic excitation within a given sector. The\ncorresponding excitation energy is defined by E(p, L) \u2212\nE0 (p, L). The other is the hole excitation and the excitation energy with respect to the ground state is given\nby E(p, L) \u2212 E0 (0, L). There are two kinds of minimal\nexcitation gaps corresponding to these excitations\n(p)\n\n\u22060\n\n(p)\n\u2206h\n\n\u2261 E1 (p, L) \u2212 E0 (p, L),\n\n(8)\n\n\u2261 E0 (p, L) \u2212 E0 (0, L).\n\nFig. 1 shows schematically the hierarchy band structure\nof the system. Within each bands (or each boxes shown in\nFig. 1) there are fermionic excitations, with the minimal\n(p)\ngaps \u22060 . While the minimal gaps of the hole excitations\n(p)\n\u2206h increase with p when the longitudinal anisotropy\nDjz = 0.\n\nSj\u2212 Sj\u2212\n\n+\n+\nshow that\n\u00b11 states.\nto the fol-\n\nSj+ Sj\u2212 + Sj\u2212 Sj+ ). So it is straightforward to\n(Sjx )2 does not couple Sjz = 0 state to Sjz =\nThus (Sjx )2 commutes with (Sjz )2 . This leads\n\nIt means that the total number of holes is a conserved\nquantity if S = 1. Consequently, the eigenstates of H can\nbe classified by the eigenvalue p of N\u03020 . In the discussion\nbelow, we will call the subsystem with p holes as the p-th\nsector.\nLet Hp be the Hilbert space of the p-th sector, the\ntotal Hilbert space is then given by the sum of all the\nsubspaces:\n\n(5)\n\nIII.\n\nMAPPING ONTO THE SPIN-1/2 TIM'S\n\nThe eigenstates of the Hamiltonian Eq.

As the total spin and its\nz-component are not conserved, the summation runs\nover all mj = 0, \u00b11 states. However, by Theorem 1,\nthe local holes are good quantum numbers and can be\n\n\f3\nis the eigenstate of H(1,L) . This HDS can be easily generalized to the multi-hole sectors.

Several explicit results of these gaps will be given in\nSection IV.\n\nregarded as non-magnetic local impurities embedded\nin the S = 1/2 Ising system. Assuming in the p-th\nsector the holes are located at xn (n = 1, 2, * * * , p),\nthen the corresponding eigenstates can be expressed\nQL\nP\n(p)\nas |\u03a8(p) i =\nj=1 \u2297|m\u0303j i, where\nm\u0303j Fm\u03031 ,m\u03032 ,*** ,m\u0303L\nm\u0303j = \u00b11 if j 6= xn , and m\u0303xn = 0.\nIn the p = 0 sector, there are only two spin states\nat each site, corresponding to m\u0303j = \u00b11 respectively.\nThey are in one-to-one correspondence with the states of\nthe spin-1/2 (Pauli) operators \u03c3jz : Sjz |m\u0303j i \u21d4 \u03c3jz |m\u0303j i =\nm\u0303j |m\u0303j i.\nOne has then the mapping relationship:\nSj\u00b1 Sj\u00b1 \u21d2 2\u03c3j\u00b1 , Sj\u00b1 Sj\u2213 \u2212 1 \u21d2 \u00b1\u03c3jz . Thus, (Sjx )2 acts\nlike (1 + \u03c3jx )/2. The original Hamiltonian, when acting\non the p = 0 subspace, has the following reduced form\nX\n1X\nz\nJj \u03c3jz \u03c3j+1\n\u2212\nH(0,L) = \u2212\nDj (1 + \u03c3jx ).\n(9)\n2\nj\nj\nThis is just the spin-1/2 Ising model with bond (site)dependent Ising couplings and transverse fields.\nNow let us turn to the p = 1 sector.\nIf\nthe hole is located at the site x1 , the corresponding state can be written as |\u03a8(1) i =\nP\n(1)\nm\u0303j F*** ,m\u0303x1 \u22121 ,0,m\u0303x1 +1 ,*** |m\u03031 * * * m\u0303x1 \u22121 0x1 m\u0303x1 +1 * * * m\u0303L i.\nNow because the bonds connecting the hole are broken,\nthe reduced Hamiltonian, obtained by acting the original\none on the p = 1 sector, is given by\n\u2032\n\u2032\nH(1,L) = H(0,x\n+ H(0,L\u2212x\n\u2212 Dx1 .\n1 \u22121)\n1)\n\n(10)\n\n\u2032\nWhere H(0,l)\nis the Hamiltonian of the spin-1/2 TIM segment of lengths\nl imposed\u2032 by the open boundary condi\u2032\ntion. If |\u03c8 (x1 \u22121)i and |\u03c8 (L\u2212x1 )i are the eigenstates of\n\u2032\n\u2032\nthe segments H(0,x\nand H(0,L\u2212x\n, respectively, then\n1 \u22121)\n1)\n\n|\u03a8(1) i = |\u03c8(x1 \u2212 1)i \u2297 |0x1 i \u2297 |\u03c8(L \u2212 x1 )i.\n\n(11)\n\np\nX\n\nDxn ,\n\n(12)\n\nn=1\n\nwhere xn 's are the positions of holes. Similarly, the eigenstate of H(p,L) can then be expressed in terms of those\nof the individual segments.\nTherefore, all the eigenstates of the S = 1 QIM (2) can\nbe obtained by solving a set of the spin-1/2 TIMs. For\nthe p-th sector, the number of the S=1/2 TIM segments\nare p + 1 or p, depending on whether the original chain\nis periodic or open. Note that the hole positions may\nvary along the chain, so there are many different hole\nconfigurations in a given sector. The decomposition of\nthe total Hilbert space into the sum of subspaces can be\nformally represented by [2 \u2295 1]\u2297L = 2\u2297L \u2295 2\u2297(L\u22121) \u2297 1 \u2295\n2\u2297(L\u22122) \u22971\u22972 \u2295* * *\u22951\u2297L , where the dimension of the S =\nPL\n1 system is given by dimH = (2+1)L = p=0 2L\u2212p CpL =\nPL\np=0 dimHp .\nIV.\n\nDIMERIZED SPIN CHAIN\nA.\n\nThe non-hole sector\n\nIn this section, we follow the standard approach introduced in Refs. [6, 27] to diagonalize the p = 0 sector of\nthe S=1 model, Eq.(9). We introduce the fermion operators cj and c\u2020j and use the Jordan-Wigner transformation\nto rewrite Eq.(9) as follows\n\u0015\nX\u0014 \u2020\n1\ncj Ajq cq + (c\u2020j Bjq c\u2020q \u2212 cj Bjq cq )\nH(0,L) =\n2\nj,q\n+HP B ,\n\n(13)\n\nwhere HP B = JL (c\u2020L c\u20201 + c\u2020L c1 \u2212 cL c\u20201 \u2212 cL c1 )(KL+1 + 1),\nAjq = Aqj = \u2212Dj \u03b4j,q \u2212 Jj \u03b4j+1,q \u2212 Jj\u22121 \u03b4j\u22121,q , and Bjq =\n\u2212Bqj = \u2212Jj \u03b4j+1,q + Jj\u22121 \u03b4j\u22121,q . Notice that HP B is the\nboundary term (which disappears for the open chains)\nand can be neglected in the thermodynamics limit.\nNext, we introduce the Bogoliubov transformation as\nin the following:\nX\nX\n\u2217 \u2020\n(gkj\ncj + h\u2217kj cj ). (14)\n(gkj cj + hkj c\u2020j ); \u03b7k\u2020 =\n\u03b7k =\nj\n\nj\n\nWhere, \u03b7k and \u03b7k\u2020 are the fermionic quasi-particle operators with quasi-momentum k. They satisfy the usual\nanti-commutation relations. While, gkj and hkj are coefficient matrices, which should be complex in general.\nThen, H(0,L) becomes\nX\n1X\n1X\nH(0,L) =\n\u039b(k)\u03b7k\u2020 \u03b7k +\nAjj \u2212\n\u039b(k).

For the dimerized (or\nalternating) chain, the M -matrix depends on the boundary conditions and the parity of the chain length (even or\nodd).

This kind of excitations for a sector\nwith fixed hole number is similar though the quasi-momentum\nis determined by the corresponding secular equation.\nB.\n\np\n(a2 \u2212 a1 )2 + 4(b1 \u2212 b2 )2 + 16b1 b2 cos2 k. (20)\n\nNote that when a1 = a2 and b1 = b2 , we have \u03c4 = \u00b11, as\nit should be for the uniform chain.\nThe eigenvalue \u039b2 (k) is then obtained by \u039b2 (k) =\n\u03932 \u00b1 W\n2 , so that one has four branches of quasi-particle\nexcitations:\nq\np\n\u039b\u00b1r (k) = \u00b1\u0393 1 \u2212 (\u22121)r 1 \u2212 P + Q cos 2k , (21)\n\nwith r = 1, 2, \u03932 = 12 (D12 + D22 + 4J12 + 4J22 ), P \u03934 =\nD12 D22 + 16J12 J22 , Q\u03934 = 8D1 D2 J1 J2 , and k = 2\u03c0m/L,\n(m = \u2212L/2, * * * L/2 \u2212 1).\nIt should be noticed that \u039b\u00b1r (k) (for r = 1, 2) are\ninvariant under the shift k \u2192 k + \u03c0. Thus the quasimomentum k is constrained in one of the following\nregimes: (1) k \u2208 [\u2212\u03c0/2, \u03c0/2) or (2) k \u2208 [\u2212\u03c0, \u2212\u03c0/2) \u222a\n[\u03c0/2, \u03c0). Here, we choose k to be in the first regime\nfor \u039b\u00b11 (k) and in the second regime for \u039b\u00b12 (k). Fig. 2\nshows the typical energy dispersions for a dimerized system with Q > 0. The case with Q < 0 can be obtained\nby a reflection under the shift.\n\nThe single-hole sector\n\nIn the p = 1 sector, the hole breaks two bonds connecting to it. For convenience, we assume that the hole\nis located at the site L. The reduced Hamiltonian can be\nrewritten as\n\nThe ratio \u03c4 = Ao /Ae is then a measure of dimerization,\ndetermined by\na1 \u2212 a2 \u00b1 W\n,\n\u03c4=\n2[b1 e\u2212ik + b2 eik ]\n\n(k)\n\nk\n\nwith a1 = D12 + 4J22 , b1 = 2D1 J1 , a2 = D22 + 4J12 , and\nb2 = 2D2 J2 .\nIn order to solve Eq.(16) with this M -matrix, we employ the following Ansatz\n(\u03a6k )2j = Ae exp[ik(2j)],\n(\u03a6k )2j+1 = Ao exp[ik(2j + 1)].\n\n(k)\n\n0\n\n-4\n\n\uf8eb\n\n(k)\n\n\u2032\nH(1,L) = H(0,L\u22121)\n\u2212 DL ,\n\n(22)\n\n\u2032\nwhere H(0,L\u22121)\nis defined by Eq. (13) but with the open\nboundary conditions. The procedure for diagonalizing\n\u2032\nH(0,L\u22121)\nis the same as for H(0,L) . The eigen wavefunction is determined by Eq.(16) in a similar way. The only\ndifference is that now the M -matrix is a (L \u2212 1) \u00d7 (L \u2212 1)\nmatrix, with ML\u22121,1 = M1,L\u22121 = 0, and M1,1 = a0 (\u2261\nD12 ).\nDue to the open boundary condition, the Ansatz\nEq. (18) is no-longer valid. Intuitively, a reflection wave\n(e\u2212ikj ) will be induced at the boundary in addition to the\nincoming wave (eikj ). Thus we suggest another Ansatz\nfor the dimerized open chain as follows:\n\u0001\n(\u03a6k )2j = Ae e2ikj \u2212 te e\u22122ikj ,\n\u0011\n\u0010\n(23)\n(\u03a6k )2j+1 = Ao eik(2j+1) \u2212 to e\u2212ik(2j+1) .\n\nWith this Ansatz, we find that \u03c4 and \u039b(k) take the same\nform as those defined in the p = 0 case. The reflection\ncoefficients, to and te , are given by\nte =\n\neiLk\n(b1 e\u2212ik + b2 eik )eiLk\n,\nt\n=\n.\no\ne\u2212iLk\n(b1 eik + b2 e\u2212ik )e\u2212iLk\n\n(24)\n\nMoreover, the quasi-momentum k is now determined by\nthe following secular equation\n\u0002\n\u0003\n2b2 b21 + b22 + 2b1 b2 cos 2k sin Lk\n= (a0 \u2212 a1 ) [b1 sin(L \u2212 2)k + b2 sin Lk]\n\u00d7 [(a1 \u2212 a2 ) \u00b1 W ] .\n(25)\n\n\f5\nThe equation is symmetric under k \u2192 \u2212k, thus we only\nneed to solve the complex or positive k's. The solution\ncan be further simplified if b1 = b2 ( or D1 J1 = D2 J2 )\nwhere to = te .\n\nC.\n\nThe multi-hole sectors\n\nThe previous approach is extended to the subsystems\nor sectors with more holes. The holes break the Ising\ncouplings, leading to a series of segments of the spin1/2 TIM's. For the periodic chain, the number of these\nsegments is equal to the number of holes p (including\nthe segment of zero length). If the holes are located at\n(x1 , x2 , * * * , xp ), then the corresponding reduced HamilPp\n\u2032\ntonian is given by Eq.(9), i.e., H(p,L) = n=1 H (0, ln ) \u2212\nPp\nn=1 Dxn , with ln = xn \u2212 xn\u22121 \u2212 1(here, x0 = xp \u2212 L)\nbeing the length of the n-th segment and\n\u2032\n\nH (0, ln ) = \u2212\n\u2212\n\nxX\nn \u22122\n\nz\nJj,j+1 \u03c3jz \u03c3j+1\n\nj=xn\u22121 +1\nxn \u22121\nxX\nn \u22121\n1 X\nDj\n.

(25) (by replacing L by ln ). Notice that\nassociated with the fixed length of the segment there\nare four different kinds of configurations, depending on\nwhether the two edge holes are located at odd or even\nsites.\n\nV.\nA.\n\nTHE LOW ENERGY SPECTRA\n\nFermionic excitations in the non-hole sector\n\nIn the previous section, we show how to diagonalize\nthe reduced Hamiltonians of different sectors. In a given\nhole sector, there are four branches of quasi-particle excitations, given by Eq. (21). Obviously, the two negative\nbranches \u039b\u2212r (k) (r = 1, 2) will be filled in the ground\nstate of that sector.\nIn the p = 0 sector, the ground state is given by\nQ\n\u2020\n\u2020\n\u2020\n|\u03c80 i = kk\u2032 \u03b7\u22121,k\n\u03b7\u22122,k\n\u2032 |0i, where \u03b7\u2212r,k (r = 1, 2) are\nthe fermionic quasi-particle operators in the branches\n\u039b\u2212r (k), k and k \u2032 are the allowed momenta for r = 1, 2,\nrespectively.\nstate energy is given by E0 (p =\nP The ground P\n0, L) = 12 k \u039b\u22121 (k) + 12 k\u2032 \u039b\u22122 (k \u2032 ).\nThe low energy excitations can be obtained by apply\u2020\ning operators \u03b72,k\n\u2032 or \u03b7\u22122,k\u2032 on the ground state. The\nexcitation energy is given by \u039b2 (k \u2032 )(= \u2212\u039b\u22122 (k \u2032 )). When\nQ > 0, the energy gap between the lowest excitation and\n\nthe ground state is given by\n\u22060 =\n\nr\n\n\u03932 \u2212\n\nq\n4,\n\u03934 \u2212 \u03b4\u2212\n\n(27)\n\np\nwhere \u03b4\u00b1 = |D1 D2 \u00b1 4J1 J2 |. If |D1 | = |D2 | = |D|\n1\n\u2212 1| with\nand |J1 | = |J2 | = |J|, one has \u22060 = 2|J|| |\u03bb|\n\u03bb = 2J/D, reproducing the result of the uniform chain.\nIn this case, the branches 1 and 2 connect smoothly. In\nthe presence of dimerization, however, the two branches\nwill split and produce a dimerization gap\n1\n\u2206d =\n2\n\nr\nq\nq\n4\n4\n\u03932 + \u03934 \u2212 \u03b4+ \u2212 \u03932 \u2212 \u03934 \u2212 \u03b4+\n\nr\n\nB.\n\n!\n\n.(28)\n\nSingle hole excitation\n\nThe ground state of the p = 1 sector has L-fold degeneracy in the uniform chain, because the energy does not\ndepend on the position of the hole. But in the presence of\ndimerization the degeneracy will be L/2-fold. While the\nmomentum-dependence of the spectra can be determined\nas in the p = 0 sector, the quasi-momentum k must satisfy the secular equation associated with the open chain\nof length L \u2212 1.\nIn the lowest state of the p = 1 sector, the bands\nwith negative energies are fully filled. ThePcorresponding energy is then given by E0 (1, L) = 21 [ k \u039b\u22121 (k) +\nP\n1\n\u2032\nk\u2032 \u039b\u22122 (k )] \u2212 2 max (D1 , D2 ). The last term is contributed from the hole which may locate at either even\nor odd sites.\nAccording to Theorem 2, the ground state of the original Hamiltonian should be the one in the p = 0 sector.\nSo in addition to the fermionic excitations, inclusion of\nthe p = 1 sector (adding a hole to the system) will induce\nthe hole excitations. The minimal hole excitation gap is\n(1)\ngiven by \u2206h \u2261 \u2206h = E0 (1, L) \u2212 E0 (0, L). The typical\nbehavior of \u2206h (as a function of D2 ) is shown in Fig. 3\nfor fixed J1 = 10, D1 = 2.0, and L = 2000, with either\nperiodic or open boundary conditions.\nIn order to understand the difference in \u2206h for the\nperiodic and open chains, we consider a special case\nwhere the chain is uniform and at the critical point, i.e.,\nD1 = D2 = D, J1 = J2 = J, and \u03bb = 2J/D = 1.\nIn this simple\n\u221a case, the energy spectrum is given by\n\u039b(k) = \u2212|D| 1 + \u03bb2 + 2\u03bb cos k, and the allowed quasiparticle momenta are k = 2m\u03c0\nL , (m = \u2212L/2, * * * , L/2\u22121)\n2m\u03c0\nfor the period boundary condition, and k = 2L+1\n,\n(m = 1, * * * , L) for the open boundary condition. Thus\nfor sufficiently large L we obtain \u2206h \u2248 0.136D and\n\u2206h \u2248 0.318D for the open and periodic chains, respectively. Their difference, \u01ebs = 0.182D, does not change for\nlarger L. So it is the surface energy cost to turn into an\nopen chain.\n\n\f6\n10\n\n4\n\n(b)\n\n(a)\n\nParamagnetic\n\n8\nJ =0.5\n\nJ =0.5\n\nJ =1.0\n\nJ =1.0\n\nJ =1.5\n\nJ =1.5\n\n2\n\nh\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n6\n\n2\n\n4\n\n4\n\n2\n\n2\n\n0\n0\n\n50\n\n100 0\n\nD\n\n50\n\n0\n100\n\nD\n\n2\n\n0\n\nMagnetically\nOrdered\n\n-2\nParamagnetic\n\n-4\n-4\n\n-2\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n2\n\nFIG. 3: The hole excitation gap \u2206h as a function of D2 for\nthe system with periodic (left panel) or open (right panel)\nboundary conditions.

The \u03a9-axis and R-axis describe the dimerization\nstrength and the competition parameter, see Eq.(30) in the\nmain text. The dashed area is the magnetic ordered phase\nwhich extends slightly for small \u03a9 but split into two parts for\n|\u03a9| > 2.\n\nMulti-hole Excitations\n\nby introducing ( assuming J1 J2 > 0)\nIt is straightforward to extend the above discussion\nto a multi-hole system. Let us start with p = 2. The\neigenfunction in the p = 2 sector is a direct product of\nthe wavefunctions for the two p = 1 segments, but with\nsmaller lattice lengths x \u2212 1 and L \u2212 x \u2212 1, respectively,\nhere x \u2261 x2 \u2212 x1 is the distance between the two holes\nsited at x1 , x2 .\nFor the uniform chain, the lowest energy state of the\np = 2 sector should correspond to the configuration\nwhere two holes are close together, as in this case the\ntotal surface energy is minimized. So the lowest hole\n(2)\nexcitation gap in the p = 2 sector is given by \u2206h =\nE0 (2, L) \u2212 E0 (0, L). For p > 2, one can further show\nthat the lowest state in the p-th sector is the configuration in which all holes are close to each other. This is the\nhole condensation phase in one dimension. The remain\nspin chain has a length L\u2212p. When p << L and L \u2192 \u221e,\n(p)\nthe finite size effect is negligible so one has \u2206h \u2248 p\u2206h .\nD.\n\nPhase Diagram\n\nWe now discuss how dimerization influence the phase\ndiagram. We have shown that the ground state still lies\nin the p = 0 sector in the presence of dimerization. However, dimerization splits the bands and induce a gap at\nhigher energies. The quantum critical points extend to\nlines, which are determined by the gapless condition, i.e.\n\u22060 = 0, or according to Eq. (27),\nD1 D2 = \u00b14J1 J2 .\n\n(29)\n\nThe influence of dimerization can be seen more clearly\n\nR=\n\nD1 + D2\nD1 \u2212 D2\n\u221a\n, \u03a9= \u221a\n.\n2 J1 J2\n2 J1 J 2\n\n(30)\n\nwhere R describes the competition between Dj and Jj ,\nand \u03a9 is a measure of the dimerization strength. In the\nuniform chain limit, R = 2/\u03bb, \u03a9 = 0. With increasing\n\u03a9, we have the following three situations:\n(1) In the weak dimerization regime, |\u03a9| < 2, there\nis\n\u221a a pair of symmetric critical points, \u00b1Rc , with Rc =\n\u03a92 + 4. The ground state is magnetically ordered when\n|R| < Rc .\n(2) In the strong dimerization regime, |\u03a9| > 2, there\nare two pairs\npoints, \u00b1Rc1 , \u00b1Rc2 ,\n\u221a of symmetric critical\n\u221a\nwith Rc1 = \u03a92 + 4, Rc2 = \u03a92 \u2212 4. The magnetically\nordered phase appears when Rc2 < R < Rc1 .\n(3) When |\u03a9| = 2 (Rc2 = 0),\u221a there are three critical points, which take values \u00b12 2, 0 respectively. The\n\u221a\nground state is magnetically disordered when |R| > 2 2,\nbut ordered (either ferromagnetic or anti-ferromagnetic,\n\u221a\ndepending on the signs of J1,2 ) when |R| < 2 2.\nNote that the R = 0 point corresponds to an alternating (or staggered) array of single-ion anisotropy\n(D,\u221a\u2212D, ..., D, \u2212D). It becomes critical when D =\n\u00b12 J1 J2 .\nThe R \u2212 \u03a9 ground state phase diagram is plotted in\nFig. 4. The magnetic ordered phase and paramegnetic\ndisordered phase are separated by the critical lines (red).\nVI.\n\nTHERMODYNAMIC PROPERTIES\n\nIn this section, we study the thermodynamic properties of the S = 1 QIM. As was shown previously, this\nmodel is exactly solvable not only for the ground state,\n\n\f7\nbut also for all excited states. However, exactly evaluating the thermodynamic quantities is still a very hard\ntask, particularly for large system size and dimerization.\nHere, we shall develop the recursion method proposed in\nRef. [9] in the evaluation of the partition function as well\nas other thermodynamic quantities for either uniform and\ndimerized chains.\nRecursion method\n\nBased on the HDS, the partition function Z(L) of the\nsystem with lattice length L can be expressed as the sum\nof all the partition functions of the subsystems, i.e.,\nZ(p, L).\n\n(31)\n\np=0\n\nWhere, Z(p, L) is the partition function of the p-th sector. Because for fixed p, there are many different hole\nconfigurations. So Z(p, L) can be further rewritten as a\nsum over all possible hole configurations\nX\nZ(x1 , * * * , xp ).\n(32)\nZ(p, L) =\n{x1 ***xp }\n\nFor each hole configuration {x1 , * * * , xp }, the corresponding partition function of the open chain is given\nby (\u03b2 = 1/kB T )\nZ(x1 , * * * , xp ) = Tre[\u2212\u03b2(\n\nPp+1\n\nn=1\n\nH\n\n\u2032\n\n(0,ln )\u2212 21\n\nPp\n\nn=1\n\nDxn )]\n\nZ(L) =\n\np=0\n\nl\nX\nj=0\n\nL\n\nNh =\n\n1 X p (p)\np\u03b1 Z (L \u2212 p).\nZ(L) p=0\n\n\u03b1 Z\n\n(p)\n\n(L \u2212 p).\n\nz(j)Z (p\u22121) (l \u2212 j),\n\n(36)\n\nFig. 5(a) shows the temperature dependence of Nh for\nseveral \u03bb. At low temperatures, Nh increases rapidly\nwith increasing temperature for small and positive \u03bb.\nThe proliferation of the hole number at low temperatures\nis obviously due to the smallness of the hole excitation\ngap. However, for the negative \u03bb, say, \u03bb = \u22121, the hole\n0.5\n(b)\n\n(a)\n\n1.0\n\n= 1.5\n\n= 0.5\n0.4\n\n1.0\n\n1.0\n\n0.8\n\n0.5\n1.5\n\n0.3\n\n0.6\n\n0.2\n\np\n\n-1.0\n\n0.4\n\n(34)\n0.1\n\n0.2\n-1.0\n\nWhere, \u03b1p is contributed from the hole's.\nTo numerically evaluate the partition function, it is\npractically convenient to use the following recursion formula:\nZ (p) (l) =\n\nThe uniform spin chain\n\nThermodynamics quantities can be calculated from the\npartition function. In our model, an important physical\nquantity is the thermal average of the hole number, defined by\n\n. (33)\n\nWhere, H \u2032 (ln ) is the Hamiltonian of the n-th segment.\nThe partition functions of each segments can be\nregarded as the building blocks of total partition\nof the original system.\nThese building blocks are\ndenoted by z(ln ), the partition functions of the\nspin-1/2 TIM segments with length ln .\nThen,\nin the uniform case, Z(L) can be expressed as\nPL P\nZ(L) =\np=0\n{ln } z(l1 )\u03b1z(l2 )\u03b1 * * * \u03b1z(lp+1 ), where\n\u03b1 = exp(\u03b2D/2) is the partition function of a hole,\nz(1) = 2 cosh(\u03b2D/2), and z(0) \u2261 1. As the length of\nthe allowedPsegment may vary, one has the summation\np+1\nconstraint n=1 ln = L \u2212 p. If we denote Z (p) (L \u2212 p) \u2261\nz(l1 )z(l2 ) * * * z(lp+1 ), then the total partition function can\nbe rewritten as\nL\nX\n\nB.\n\nS\n\nL\nX\n\nh\n\nZ(L) =\n\nN\n\nA.\n\nwhere, Z (\u22121) (l) \u2261 \u03b4l,0 and Z (0) (l) \u2261 z(l). By this way,\nwe firstly calculate the building block, z(ln ), and then\nby iterative use of above relation, evaluate the partition\nfunction of the S = 1 system. We find that this method\nis particular efficient for the uniform chain, where the\nsystem size L could be as large as L = 10000.\nIt is non-trivial to extend the above recursion method\nto the spin chain in the presence of dimerization. Here,\nthere are four kinds of blocks, associated with the parity\nof the two ends. Thus we can denote them by zr1 r2 (ln ),\nwith r1,2 (= o, e) indicating the left/right ends respectively. The S = 1/2 TIM segments with odd or even end\nsites can be solved exactly. The analytical expressions\nfor zr1 r2 (ln ) will be provided in a separated supplementary material[28]. In the following, we present some numerical results obtained by the recursion method while\nthe system size is kept at L = 2000. For simplicity, we\nuse the open boundary condition for the original S = 1\nchain. The extension to the periodic boundary condition\nis straightforward.\n\n(35)\n\n0.0\n\n0.0\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\nT/J\n\n3 0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\nT/J\n\nFIG. 5: Temperature dependence of the hole concentration\nNh (a) and the entropy S (b) for a uniform spin chain with\n\u03bb = \u22121, 0.5, 1, 1.5, respectively.\n\n\f8\n0.6\n\n0.4\nD =5\n2\n\n0.5\n\n(b)\n\n(a)\n\n0.8\n\nD =80\n\nD =80\n\n2\n\n0.4\n\n2\n\n20\n\n0.6\n\n20\n\nS\n\nN\n\nh\n\n0.3\n\nC\n\nC (p=0)\n\nC (p=0)\n\n0.3\n\n0.2\n20\n\n0.2\n\n0.1\n\n80\n0.0\n\n0.0\n4\n\nT/J\n\nThe dimerized spin chain\n\nC\n\n0.4\n\n0\n\nC.\n\n(c)\n\n(b)\n\n(a)\n\nC\n\nexcitation gap is relatively larger, so Nh increases much\nslowly with temperatures.\nAnother interesting physical quantity is the entropy\nS, which we plot as a function of temperature for several\ndifferent \u03bb in Fig. 5(b). We find that the suppression of\nthe entropy S is stronger for larger \u03bb. The suppression is\neven more pronounced for the negative \u03bb. These behavior\nare similar to the temperature dependence of the hole\nnumber and are also due to the hole excitation gap.\nWe also find that the Nh approaches about 1/3 in the\nhigh temperature limit for all \u03bb. Correspondingly, the entropy saturates at the value ln 3 in the high temperature\nlimit(not fully shown in Fig. 5).\n\n8\n\n2\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n30\n\nT/J\n\n2\n\n45\n\n0\n\n2\n\nT/J\n\n4\n\n2\n\nFIG. 7: (Color Online) (a) The specific heat C for D1 D2 =\nJ1 J2 , D2 = 5 (blue-dashed line), D1 D2 = 4J1 J2 , D2 = 20\n(red-real line), D1 D2 = 16J1 J2 , D2 = 80 (dash-dotted line)\nwith J1 = 10, J2 = 1, and D1 = 2, respectively; (b) The specific heat C (dash-dotted line) and the corresponding specific\nheat C(p=0) for the p = 0 subsystem (green open circle) for\nD1 D2 = 16J1 J2 and J1 = 10, J2 = 1, D1 = 2, D2 = 80, respectively.

Where,\nJ1 = 10, J2 = 1, and D1 = 2 are fixed.\n\nThe recursion method, after some extensions discussed\npreviously, is also used to evaluate thermodynamic quantities for a dimerized system. Figs. 6 and 7(a) show the\ntemperature dependence of the entropy S, the average\nhole concentration Nh , and the specific heat C in the\nordered (D1 D2 = J1 J2 ), critical (D1 D2 = 4J1 J2 ), and\ndisordered phases(D1 D2 = 16J1 J2 ), respectively. Here\nwe fix J1 = 10, J2 = 1, D1 = 2, and choose several\nD2 (= 5, 20, and 80) in Figs. 6 and 7(a). Note that\nboth the dimerization strength and competition parameter are tuned by varying D2 . The general features of the\nhole number and the entropy are similar to that in the\nuniform case as the hole excitation gap plays the role at\nlow temperatures (note that when J1 = 10, J2 = 1, and\nD1 = 2, \u2206h = 7.450, 3.902, and 1.202 for D2 = 5, 20,\nand 80, respectively).\nIn Figs. 7, the specific heat is plotted as a function\nof temperature in several cases. We find that at lowtemperatures the specific heat is peaked at the tem-\n\nperature scale near the hole excitation gap. The peak\nbehavior changes depending on the competition of the\nfermionic and hole excitations. The influence of the\ndimerization on the specific heat can be clearly seen at\nrelatively higher temperatures, as the dimerization induced gap is much larger than the hole or fermion excitation gaps. Fig. 7(b) shows the specific heats of the\nS = 1 QIM system and its p = 0 sector for the case\nJ1 = 10, J2 = 1, D1 = 2, D2 = 80. Note that the\np = 0 sector is identical to the corresponding S = 1/2\nTIM. In this case \u22060 (\u223c \u2206h ) is very small, leading to\na sharp peak in the S = 1 QIM system. We also find\na well separated and relatively round peak in the higher\ntemperature regime where the energy scale is close to the\ndimerization gap \u2206d (= 40.025).\nThe competitions among the dimerization effect, the\nhole excitations and the fermion excitations can be seen\nmore clearly from Fig. 7(c) where J1 = J2 = 1, D1 = 2,\nand D2 = 7. In this case, the three kinds of gaps are\nwell separated, \u2206h < \u22060 < \u2206d , so that the specific heat\nexhibits three peaks. The first one is a sharp peak around\nT \u223c \u2206h [29], other two peaks are around T \u223c \u22060 and\nT \u223c \u2206d , respectively. By contrast, the low temperature\nsharp peak disappears in the p = 0 sector and other two\npeaks still persist [see the red dotted line in Fig. 7(c)].\nThis is in agreement with the fact that no hole excitation\nexists in the p = 0 sector.\nWe also calculated the scaled free energy \u03a6s (T ) at the\ncritical point D1 D2 = 4J1 J2 for the dimerized spin chain.\n\n\f9\nD.\nS=1,\n\n0.5\n\nJ = 3,\n\nD = 6\n\nS=1/2, J = 3,\n\nD = 6\n\n1\n\n1\n\nS=1,\n\nNow we turn to the case with non-zero Dz . It is\nstraightforward to show that the Dz -term plays the role\nof chemical potential for holes in the S = 1 QIM [9].\nMore specifically, the energy of a p-hole sector with finite Dz is related to that with Dz = 0 by the following\n(p)\nrelationship [E0 (0) \u2261 E0 (p, L)]:\n\n2\n\nJ = 10, D = 20\n1\n\n2\n\n0.3\n\ns\n\n(T)\n\n0.4\n\n2\n\nHole condensations: the case with finite Dz\n\n0.2\n\n(p)\n\n(p)\n\nE0 (Dz ) = E0 (0) + pDz .\n\n0.1\n\nThus, with finite Dz , the fermion excitation spectra remain unchanged, but the hole excitation gap becomes[31]\n\n0.0\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n(38)\n\n6\n\nJ /T\n\n\u2206h (Dz ) = \u2206h (0) + Dz .\n\n2\n\nFIG. 8: (Color Online) The scaled free energy for the dimerized systems in the quantum critical phase where D1 D2 =\n4J1 J2 .

In the\ncritical region where quantum critical fluctuations dominate this quantity should be a constant. It was shown\nthat in the S = 1/2 uniform TIM it deviates from the\nconstant only when T & J/2, indicating a rather higher\ntemperature scale below which the quantum critical scaling behavior persists [30]. In our recent work Ref.[9], we\nfound that in the uniform S = 1 QIM this behavior is\nstrongly suppressed by the hole excitations. Here, we\nfind that the similar conclusion can be inferred in the\npresence of dimerization. In Fig. 8, we plotted the results for two cases (i) J1 = 3, J2 = 1, D1 = 2, D2 = 6,\nand (ii) J1 = 10, J2 = 1, D1 = 2, and D2 = 20. As a\ncomparison, the corresponding result for the dimerized\nS = 1/2 TIM is also plotted. We find that the quantum\ncritical scaling behavior at T \u2192 0 (or J2 /T \u2192 \u221e in the\nFigure 8) persists approximately at finite T \u2248 0.5J2 for\nthe dimerized S = 1/2 TIM and the case (ii), and at\nT \u2248 0.2J2 for the case (i), respectively. This is because\nthat the hole gap in the case (i) is much smaller than the\ncase (ii). Consequently, the hole excitations play more\nsignificant role in suppressing the quantum critical scaling behavior in the former case. This result is consistent\nwith the conclusion in Ref. [9].\n\n9\n\n2\n\nFIG. 9: (Color Online) Temperature dependence of the hole\nconcentration Nh for Dz = 0 or Dz = \u2212\u2206h (0). Other parameters are J1 = 10, J2 = 1, and D1 = 2.\n\nTherefore, the ground state depends strongly on the\nvalue of Dz . When Dz > \u2212\u2206h (0), the hole excitation\nis positive, and the ground state is still in the p = 0sector. But when Dz < \u2212\u2206h (0), the hole excitation gap\nis negative. This indicates that the p = 0 sector is no\nlonger the lowest energy state and there are holes in the\nground state. As a result, Theorem 2 is no longer valid\nin the present case. When L is sufficiently large and p is\nrelatively small, the lowest energy of the p-sector can be\n(0)\n(p)\napproximated by E0 (0) \u2248 E0 (0)+p\u2206h (0) as discussed\n(p)\n(0)\nin the previous section. Then, E0 (Dz ) \u2248 E0 (Dz ) +\np[\u2206h (0) + Dz ], so that we have\n(L)\n\n(1)\n\n(0)\n\nE0 (Dz ) . * * * . E0 (Dz ) . E0 (Dz ).\n\n(40)\n\nThus, the order of the band structure hierarchy is completely overturned. In this case, the ground state is in the\np = L sector and all sites are occupied by holes[9]. This\ncan be also seen clearly from Fig. 9, where the temperature dependence of the hole concentration Nh is shown.\nWe find that in the zero temperature limit, Nh is equal\nto 1 when Dz \u2264 \u2212\u2206h (0) or 0 when Dz > \u2212\u2206h (0).\n\n\f10\nVII.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nWe have developed a recursion method to sum over\nall hole configurations efficiently. This provides a powerful approach for evaluating rigourously all thermodynamic quantities as well as static and dynamic correlation functions of the QIMs in the thermodynamic limit.\nThe detailed derivations for these quantities in the presence of dimerization will be provided as a supplementary\nmaterial[28]. The recursion method holds not just for the\nmodel studied here. It can be easily extended and applied\nin other physical systems whose Hamiltonian can be written as a sum of independent spin segments, separated by\nnonmagnetic impurities, such as Pd- or Zn-doped quasione-dimensional antiferromagnets Sr2 (Cu1\u2212x Pdx )O3 or\nCu1\u2212x Znx GeO3 [32, 33].\n\nIn this paper, we have studied a class of exactly solvable S = 1 QIMs with single-ion anisotropy. They exhibit\na hierarchy of the band structure with both fermionic and\nhole excitations. The hole excitation gap can be tuned by\nthe longitudinal crystal field Dz . It becomes zero when\nDz is equal to \u2212\u2206h (0). The ground state exhibits three\ndistinct phases: the magnetically ordered or disordered\nphases when Dz > \u2212\u2206h (0), or the hole condensation\nphase when Dz < \u2212\u2206h (0). The transition to the hole\ncondensation phase is of the first order.\nWe have shown that dimerization does not destroy the\nexact solvability of this model. To our knowledge, this\nis the first example in dimerized S = 1 quantum spin\nsystems where all the eigen states as well as the wavefunctions and the eigen energies can be solved exactly.\nThe hole excitations enhance the thermodynamic fluctuations as evidenced in the specific heat which shows a\nsharp peak in the low-temperature region where the hole\nexcitations proliferate. This strongly reduces the characteristic temperature below which the quantum criticality\npersists. All these results are robust against the dimerization. However, dimerization deforms the phase diagram\nand affects the high energy behavior.\n\nZ.H.Y. would like to thank Z.X. Xu for helpful discussions.
