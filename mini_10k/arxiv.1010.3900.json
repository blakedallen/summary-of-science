[2, 3]. Based on a sudden transition assumption huge effects were predicted for this phenomenon. About a further dozen applications followed.\nIn a subsequent paper together with Gyulassy [4] it was\nshown that the finite duration \u03c4 of the transition reduces the effect. In that paper, however, the authors\nused a discontinuous and therefore unrealistic transition\nprofile that led to large ultraviolet Fourier components\nand thus to a very moderate reduction of the effect of\norder (2\u03c9\u03c4 )\u22122 . Here 2\u03c9 is the energy required to produce the pair.

Left: the standard\nreflection-transmission situation, where a wave traverses from\none medium (yellow) to another one (e.g. vacuum) at a spatial interface. Right: the sudden transition in time from the\nmedium to the vacuum; here the frequency \u03c9 is discontinuous,\ncreating a second component with negative \u03c9 which has the\ninterpretation of an antiparticle with opposite momentum.\nThe (blue) dashed line separates the media, the arrow sense\ndistinguishes between particle and antiparticle. By means of\nLorentz transformations the concept can directly be generalized to hyper-planes and even to curved hyper-surfaces.\n\nII.\n\nTHE SUDDEN PICTURE\n\nThe main assumption of the original approach [1] is\nthe sudden change from the in-medium situation to that\nin vacuum. The authors used the Bogolioubov-Valatin\n(BV) transformation to describe the effect, a picture\nthat may not be so intuitive for many of us. Indeed\nthe effect is nothing else than a standard \"reflection\u2013\ntransmission\" problem at the interface of two media, a\nwell known problem in physics, in particular in optics.\nThus, transcribing our wisdom from the spatial situation, like a wave traversing from one medium to another\none at a sharp interface (see Fig. 1 left) to the here considered sudden transition in time (Fig. 1 right), precisely\nrecovers the results presented in [1, 4]. The common\nboundary condition is that one has one incoming wave\nand two time-forward propagating outgoing wave components. As in Refs. [1, 4] we restrict the discussion\nto (charged) relativistic bosons described by the KleinGordon (KG) equation. For the sudden case the wave\nfunctions with positive and negative energies prior and\npost to the sudden transition can then be written as (using units with ~=c=1)\n1\ne\u2213i\u03a9k t+ikx for t < 0 ,\n(1)\n2\u03a9k\n\u0001\n1\n\u03a8\u00b1\nck e\u2213i\u03c9k t+ikx + sk e\u00b1i\u03c9k t+ikx .

Within the standard rela-\n\n\f2\ntivistic quantum field theory (RQFT) interpretation of\nthe negative energy components as antiparticles with opposite spatial momenta, cf. Fig. 1 right frame, this result\nidentically reproduces that given in Refs. [1, 4] within\nthe BV picture.

In the spatial case solely k\u22a5 is\ndiscontinuous (\u03c9 and kk are continuous). In the sudden\ncase, however, k is continuous, while the discontinuity in\ntime causes a discontinuity in \u03c9 thereby creating a second component with negative \u03c9, i.e. an antiparticle with\nopposite spatial momentum k (Fig. 1 right frame). This\nmechanism led to the back-to-back particle\u2013antiparticle\ncorrelation picture advocated in Ref. [1]. Besides small\nantiparticle components arising form the existing particles in the medium, the time dependent interaction can\nalso create genuine particle\u2013antiparticle pairs out of the\nvacuum. The latter, which is the bosonic analog to the\nDirac case, where a time-dependent interaction pulse can\nlift a particle from the filled Dirac sea to the particle\nspace1 , can formally be included by adding a \"+1\" to\nthe boson occupations nk of the antiparticles. After the\ntransition the one-body density becomes\n\n\u2212\u2192 1 + |sk |2\n\nstatistical occupations nk fall below |sk |2 . The subsequent considerations will show that this effect is an artifact resulting from the sudden limit.\n\nIn the Dirac case also spatial transitions (Fig. 1 left) lead to\nspontaneous pair production, known as Klein paradox [5], once\nthe vector potential changes by more than twice the rest mass.\n\n(13)\n\nfor a smoothly time-dependent dispersion relation\n\u03a92 (t) = \u03c9 2 + \u03a0R (t) = \u03c9 2 + \u03a0R (\u2212\u221e)F (t).\n\n(14)\n\nHere negative times refer to the situation in the medium\nwhere \u03a0R denotes the time-dependent retarded polarization function2 , while the vacuum case is attained for large\npositive times. Thereby F (t), cf. Fig. 2 below, will later\nbe used to parameterize the transition profile.\nBesides direct numerical solutions of (13), there are\napproximate analytical methods to obtain the reflection\ncoefficient. These concern the single reflection limit as\nwell as refined semi-classical methods.\nA.\n\nSingle reflection approximation\n\nA simple generalisation of the sudden limit towards a\ncontineous treatment is provided by the single reflection\napproximation (SR). In this scheme the continuous function F (t) is approximated by a sequence of steps each\nproviding a reflected wave component according to (6).\nIn the continuum limit the coherent sum of these partial\nreflections leads to\n\u0012\n\u0013\nZ t\nZ \u221e\n\u03a9\u0307(t)\n0\n0\nSR\nexp \u22122i\ndt \u03a9(t ) (15)\nA\n=\ndt\n2\u03a9(t)\n\u2212\u221e\n0\nZ \u221e\n\u2248\ndt \u03a8\u2217f (t)\u03a9\u0307(t)\u03a8i (t).\n(16)\n\u2212\u221e\n\nThereby the appropriate phase coherence is approximately provided by describing the unreflected wave components of particles (i) and their antiparticle partners (f)\nin the semi-classical (WKB) limit as\np\nRt\n\u03a8i (t) = \u03a8\u2217f (t) \u2248 exp(\u2212i 0 dt0 \u03a9(t0 ))/ 2\u03a9(t). (17)\n\n2\n\nIn general the polarization function \u03a0 can also be non-local in\ntime and thus be energy dependent in the semi-classical interpretation. Then the mapping from the medium to the vacuum case\nwill involve corresponding \"z\"-factors, z = 1/(1 \u2212 \u2202Re \u03a0R /\u2202\u03c9 2 ),\nas e.g. shown in Kadanoff-Baym final-state interaction picture\n[6]. For the example cases discussed here we will discard such\ngeneralization and stick to time local cases.\n\n\f3\nSince \u03a9\u0307 is peaked and limited to a narrow range in t, the\nantiparticle amplitude A is essentially given by the time\nFourier transformed of \u03a9\u0307(t), i.e.\n\u03a9\u2212\u03c9\n|g(2\u03c9\u0304)| with\n|sk | \u2248 |ASR | \u2248\n\u03a9+\u03c9\nZ\ndF (t)\ng(\u03c9) = dt e\u2212i\u03c9t f (t),\nf (t) = \u2212\n.\ndt\n\n(18)\n(19)\n\nwith abbreviations \u03a9 = \u03a9(\u2212\u221e) and \u03c9 = \u03a9(+\u221e). Thereby \u03c9\u0304 = \u03a9(t\u0304) is chosen around the maximum of \u03a9\u0307.\nAs multiple reflections at the different steps are suppressed, the approximation solely recovers terms linear\nin \u2206\u03a9 = \u03a9 \u2212 \u03c9. Compared to the sudden result (6) the\nsuppression of the antiparticle amplitude caused by the\nfinite duration of the transition is then given by g(2\u03c9\u0304).\nThis was also the approximation scheme used in Ref. [4]\nwhere, however, a completely unrealistic form for f (t)\nwas considered, namely f (t) = \u0398(t) exp[\u2212t/\u03c4 ]/\u03c4 . This\nform contains a sharp jump which leads to unrealistically high Fourier components for large \u03c9, and thus only\nto a very moderate suppression of the effect! More realistic forms for \u03a9(t) generally will lead to exponential\nsuppression factors, as e.g. for the following analytically\nsolvable cases\nF (t)\n1\n2\n\n(a)\n\n\u2212\n\n1\n\u03c0\n\n\u03c0t\narctan 2\u03c4\n\nwith C = (1, 4, (4\u03c0 \u03c9\u0304\u03c4 )2 ) and \u03b1 = (2/\u03c0, 1, \u03c0/2) for the\ncases (a) to (c) of (20). Thereby the asymptotic exponential behavior is directly determined by the imaginary\npart of the nearest complex pole position of F (t).\nThe physical case where the polarization function is\nswitched on and off, i.e where F (t) takes the form of\na bell shape can simply be retrieved by replacing F (t)\nby its time derivative Fbell (t) = 2\u03c4 f (t) with f (t) from\ntable (20). The corresponding \"pulse\" has a maximum\nof 1 and a time integral of 2\u03c4 .

Thus, the original effect\nadvocated in Refs. [1, 4] of unlimitedly large correlations with increasing \u03a9k resulting in the sudden case\n(\u03c4 = 0) turns into the opposite behavior, once the duration time \u03c4 exceeds the inverse temperature 1/T . Already for charged pion pairs (\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 ) with \u03a9k \u2248 300 MeV\nthe correlation (30) falls below the 10\u22125 level for transition times \u03c4 beyond 3 fm/c, at typical freeze-out temperatures of T \u2248 140 MeV. Since optical potentials are\ngenerally proportional to the density, the characteristic\ntransition-time scale is rather given by the expansiontime scale [9\u201311] in nuclear collisions. Its full-width-halfmaximum values generally lie beyond 4 fm/c, leading to\n\n[1] M. Asakawa and T. Cs\u00f6rg\u0151, Heavy Ion Phys. 4, 233\n(1996), hep-ph/9612331.\n[2] A. Vourdas and R. M.

Thus, the pair creation\nprocess due to the time variation of the mean field becomes unmeasurably small in nuclear collisions.\nThe discussed particle\u2013antiparticle correlation effect\nrests on a coherent single-particle picture. Among others it largely ignores collisional effects that are known to\ndominate the nuclear collision dynamics. Thus, in individual events the one-body field will depart from the\nensemble mean due to fluctuations caused by stochastic\nprocesses. Such microscopic processes can involve much\nshorter time scales which, however, are also ultra violet restricted by the frequencies accessible in the system.\nFor thermal systems this limit is given by the inverse temperature scale, i.e. \u03c4 > 1/T , limiting the \"thermal\" production of hard probes, such as the particle\u2013antiparticle\npairs. Such stochastic processes generally add incoherently to the two-particle yield. Therefore they can appropriately be included in transport codes by simulating\nthe corresponding microscopic collision processes. The\nresulting pair correlations, however, are no longer strictly\nback-to-back, as they are influenced by thermal motion.\nThe question, whether a process can be treated in the\nsudden limit or not, depends on its intrinsic quantum\ntime scale resulting from the uncertainty principle to\n\u03c4Q \u2248 1/\u2206E, where \u2206E is the energy transfer. Driven\nby a certain field, the dynamics is \"sudden\", if the\ntypical time duration \u03c4 , during which the field changes,\nis short compared to \u03c4Q : then the wave functions stay\n\"inert\" across the transition thereby creating several\ncomponents in the eigenstates of the \"new\" Hamiltonian.\nIn the opposite limit \u03c4 \u001d \u03c4Q the quantum states change\nand adjust adiabatically. As shown here for the pair\ncreation case, where \u2206E = 2\u03a9k , the creation of states\ninvolving an energy transfer \u2206E \u001d 1/\u03c4 then becomes\nexponentially suppressed.\n\nAcknowledgement\n\nThe author acknowledges constructive discussions with\nP.
