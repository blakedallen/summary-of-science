Light from distant objects undergoes deflection as it passes through intervening overdense regions, inducing tangential alignment of the objects' image. Numerous cosmological\nparameters can be inferred from correlations in these alignments. One important lensing\nstatistic is the correlation in ellipticity between objects as a function of their separation.\nFor over a decade this technique has been used to infer individual galaxy (Fischer et al.\n2000) and cluster masses (Tyson et al. 1990). More recently, the lensing technique has\nbeen extended to inferring large-scale structure, where it is often referred to as cosmic shear\n(Mellier & van Waerbeke 2001). Here the signal is weak and many galaxies must be surveyed\nto overcome lack of knowledge of the intrinsic ellipticities (shape noise). Nonetheless, this\ntechnique has been yielding estimates of \u03c38 \u03a90.3\nm (the bias factor times the amount of matter\nin the universe relative to the critical density) consistent with other techniques (Jarvis et al.\n2006). The next generation of weak lensing instruments will extend these results to individual redshift intervals. From this, stringent constraints will be placed on w and w \u2032, the\ncosmological equation of state and its first derivative, respectively.\nThe optics, camera and atmospheric turbulence all contribute to lensing systematic errors, with the latter effect being perhaps the most serious. For a large aperture telescope, a\nthousand or more turbulent cells are in view at the aperture at any given time, giving rise\nto appreciable instantaneous ellipticity. For an intermediate length exposure of \u223c 15 s this\nraw ellipticity is reduced by the number of independent atmospheric realizations, which in\nturn depends on the wind speed. Objects which happen to lie close to one another have approximately sampled the same portion of the atmosphere and should have similar ellipticity\nvectors; those further apart will be less similar. In this way the atmosphere induces correlations that mimic a lensing signal. Numerous techniques have been developed to remove\nspurious atmospheric power, however, these techniques are dependent on the spatial distribution of fiducial objects whose point spread functions (PSFs) are known. Furthermore, these\nsame techniques may require a degree of coherence between these objects, otherwise little\ncan be said about the behavior of the PSF between them. In short, atmospheric turbulence\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\naffects weak lensing measurements in two ways: by introducing both spurious ellipticity and\ncausing spatial decoherence. It is desirable to characterize the magnitude of this effect in\ndata and simulations.\nThe remainder of this paper is devoted to assessing the impact of atmospheric turbulence on weak lensing measurements. Recently it was shown that under good seeing conditions atmospheric residuals lie comfortably below the level expected of a weak lensing signal\n(Wittman 2005). The need for controlling a dominant systematic effect like atmospheric\nturbulence, especially in the context of future ground based lensing measurements cannot\nbe understated. Here we systematically study image ellipticities and build on that result by\nexploring image ellipticities over a range of seeing conditions with known atmospheric turbulence and wind conditions. In Section 2 we describe the image and atmospheric data set.\nIn Section 3 we show that the wind direction can be inferred by correlations in the ellipticity\nresiduals. We then turn to ellipticity correlations as a function of seeing and investigate\nhow seeing affects PSF interpolation. Photon shot noise introduces an irreducible ellipticity\nfloor which is modeled and compared to observational data. Finally, we construct lensing\nstatistics from the corrected ellipticities of PSF stars and compare them with a putative\nsignal. These results may have bearing on site selection for the next generation of proposed\ntelescopes and also implications for their science requirements.\n\n2.\n\nObservations\n\nTo study atmospheric impacts on weak lensing science, discretionary time was awarded\non the Gemini Multi-Object Spectrograph (GMOS) Gemini South (Hook et al. 2006). GMOS\nis a three chip camera spanning 5.6\u2032 on a side. Forty three R-Band images were obtained over\nthe course of four nights spanning May 10-13, 2005. On three of the four nights (excepting\n05/11) observations were divided into two intervals, for a total of seven viewing windows.\nObservations were done on two different fields having bright reference stars. The first (second) field is denoted with a black (grey) date label in Fig 1. The intrinsic stellar density of\nthe first field is approximately three times that of the second. The images were processed using the Gemini IRAF1 reduction routines to remove bias and gain variation. No flat fielding\nwas performed. The upper plot shows the median seeing and source object count, computed with the Gemini IRAF script gemseeing and SExtractor2 , respectively.

However,\nthe atmosphere, instrument and shot noise all introduce spurious ellipticity which must be\nremoved to recover the lensing signal. The success of a procedure in removing spurious\nellipticity is directly tested by applying it to stars, whose PSF one knows a priori to be\nround: we therefore limit our study to stellar objects.\nConsiderable variation in ellipticity definition is found in the literature. Here we adopt\nthe definition\n\n\u01eb=\n\n1 \u2212 \u03b22\n,\n1 + \u03b22\n\n(1)\n\nin which \u03b2 is the ratio of the minor to major axes of the fitted ellipse.

Systematic effects appear as correlations in ellipticity vectors across the image. To assess quanitatively the efficacy of correction procedures for removing PSF effects we define\n\nN\n1 X 2\n\u01ebRM S =\n(\u01eb1,i + \u01eb22,i )1/2\nN i\n\uf8ee\n!2\n!2 \uf8f91/2\nN\nN\nX\nX\n1 \uf8f0\n\u01eb1,i +\n\u01eb2,i \uf8fb\n\u01ed =\nN\ni\ni\n\n= (\u01ed21 + \u01ed22 )1/2 .\n\n(4)\n\n(5)\n\nThe first quantity \u01ebRM S is the root-mean-square ellipticity magnitude, while \u01ed is the average\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\n\n2500\n\n\u03b5RMS = 0.12\n\n\u03b5 = 0.12 \u03b5RMS = 0.04\n\n\u03b5 = 0.0 \u03b5RMS = 0.03\n\n\u03b5 = 0.0016\n\ny-pixel location\n\n2000\n\n1500\n\n1000\n\n500\n\n0\n0\n\n1000\n\n2000\n\n3000\n\n1000 2000 3000\nx-pixel location\n\n1000\n\n2000\n\n3000\n\nFig. 2.- Raw ellipticities of 811 stars from frame 36 (left) and after vector subtraction of\nthe average \u01eb1 and \u01eb2 ellipticities (middle). From its initial value of 0.12, \u01ebRM S is reduced\nto 0.03 after processing through the lensing pipeline (right). More significantly, \u01ed is reduced\nfrom 0.12 (left) to 0.0016 (right). Note that though (by construction) \u01ed in the middle plot\nis zero, correlations nonetheless persist among the objects, especially near the edges.\nellipticity. The sums in these equations are over all 811 stars. Both quantities vanish in the\nround star limit; the latter likewise vanishes if the ellipticity vectors are randomly oriented.\nThe three panels in Figure 2 show the ellipticities of 811 stars in frame 36 derived using\nsteps 1-3 of the measurement procedure described in Section 3.3. (For reference, SExtractor\nidentified a total of 1536 objects in the same frame.) The close agreement between \u01ebRM S\nand \u01ed in the leftmost panel reflects the high degree of correlation (presumably telescope\ntracking errors). A necessary next step is the removal of spurious ellipticity correlation,\nwhich otherwise mimics the weak lensing signal. A first order correction is to remove the\ncommon mode seen in that panel. The middle panel in Figure 2 is constructed in this\n\u2032\nmanner, with \u01ebRM S defined as\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\n\n\u2032\n\n\u01ebRM S\n\nN\n1 X\n((\u01eb1,i \u2212 \u01ed1 )2 + (\u01eb2,i \u2212 \u01ed2 )2 )1/2\n=\nN i\n\n(6)\n\nreplacing \u01ebRM S of Eqn. 4 and \u01ed1,2 defined as in Eqn. 5. The middle panel shows the effect\n\u2032\nof subtracting off the lowest order common mode. Though \u01ebRM S has been reduced to 0.04,\nthere remain persistent correlations, especially near the image corners. With this redefinition,\n\u01ed is identically zero. The rightmost panel in that same figure shows the ellipticities after\nprocessing the image through the entire pipeline. Here \u01ebRM S and \u01ed are reduced to 0.03 and\n0.0016, respectively. More important, no obvious correlations persist. For this reason we\nmake extensive use of the pipeline when discussing atmospheric residuals in Section 3.3.\nHaving emphasized the preeminent role that stars play in subsequent analyses and with\nsome idea of the ellipticity magnitudes we now consider how their correlations depend on\nwind and seeing conditions.\n\n3.1.\n\nEllipticity Correlations with Wind\n\nThe next generation of weak lensing measurements will likely include high-fidelity simulations to disentangle systematic effects from the signal. A crucial component of these will\nbe atmospheric simulations, which require, among other things, wind speed and direction as\na function of height as their input. These data may or may not be readily available at many\nobserving sites. Even if it does, it is still non-trivial to infer an effective wind direction and\nspeed across the aperture. It therefore would be useful to extract wind information from the\nimage itself as one is accustomed to do for seeing.\nWe see no wind information in the distribution of first moments of object intensities\n(seeing). However, it can be extracted by considering the second moments (ellipticities). The\ndominant ellipticity trend observed in the leftmost panel in Fig. 2 could well be attributed\nto the effects of wind transport across the aperture, but may also contain non-atmospheric\ncomponents such as wind-shake of the telescope or guiding / tracking errors. We therefore\ncannot assume a priori that the dominant ellipticity trend is solely due to the wind.\nTo eliminate competing phenomena as the origin of the dominant ellipticity we perform\npairwise vector subtraction of the raw ellipticity components of stars across the image, with\nthe ellipticity components ea and eb derived from the shape parameter \u01eb and position angle\n\u03b8 in the following manner\n\u01eb= 1\u2212\n\nea\neb\n\n(7)\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\ntan \u03b8 =\n\neb\n.\nea\n\n(8)\n\nAs defined above, ea and eb are the lengths of the major- and minor axes of the ellipse,\nrespectively. It follows that \u01ebx = cos \u03b8 and \u01eby = sin \u03b8 are the ellipticity projections onto the\nx- and y-axes of the detector, respectively. The ellipticity residual is then defined as\n\u01ebres = ((\u01ebx,i \u2212 \u01ebx,j )2 + (\u01eby,i \u2212 \u01eby,j )2 )1/2 .\n\n(9)\n\nIn constructing this latter quantity we arrive at a distribution of ellipticity residuals from\nwhich the common-mode ellipticity has been removed3 . The ellipticity residuals can be\nprojected onto the rows and columns of the detector (as in Eq. 9), along the RA and DEC\ncoordinate system, or along any other set of axes. (For an alt-az mount telescope like Gemini\nSouth a camera rotator is used to hold the instrument at a fixed position angle. For these\ndata the position angle was such that the axes were aligned with RA and DEC.) In Fig. 3, we\nplot the magnitude of one of these components as a function of position angle. A position\nangle of 0\u25e6 corresponds to a basis in which the x-axis corresponds to the RA direction,\nand the y-axis with the DEC direction. Any positive rotation is then counter-clockwise\nthrough the East. While the total magnitude of the ellipticity is a rotational invariant, the\nmagnitude of the projected values are not. Fig. 3 plots the projection along the vertical axis;\nby construction the x-axis values are offset in phase by 90 degrees.\nThe curve for each frame (as indicated on the right side of the plot) has a distinctive\nminimum. Even though only a selected few frames are shown, all image data exhibit this\nbehavior, albeit with lower significance for poorer seeing. Because the ellipticity residuals are\nat a minimum at a particular rotation, we can interpret this position angle as the direction\nin which the residuals are most correlated: a longer correlation length lowers the median\nellipticity value as the PSFs are more similar along that direction. This stretching of the\ncorrelation length in a particular direction we believe is due to the more or less constant wind\ndirections of the dominant wind layers (ground-layer and 200 mb jet-stream layer) across\nthe telescope aperture. In essence, this transport of the air across the telescope ensures that\notherwise uncorrelated regions of the detector see the same atmosphere, resulting in more\nsimilar PSFs along this effective wind direction.\nDuring the observations the ground layer wind direction varied from 300 to 330 degrees\n(Fig. 1), with wind speeds of up to 6 m/s. The jet-stream layer was blowing due East with\nwind-speeds of about 30 m/s. If we assume that the wind directions are constant, then the\n3\n\nWe expect these non-atmospheric components of the ellipticity to be extremely uniform across the\ndetector and, therefore, to be removed very efficiently.\n\n\f\u2013 10 \u2013\nonly orientation variable left is the relative positioning of the telescope with respect to these\nwinds.\nFigure 4 summarizes the minima for all our image frames. It is clear that the data\nfall in two groups: one for which the telescope was pointed along the ground-wind direction\n(azimuth \u223c150\u25e6 , down triangles), and one pointed almost perpendicular to the ground-wind\n(azimuth \u223c 215\u25e6 , up triangles). We find that that these minima are consistent over multiple\ndays, ultimately reflecting similar observation and wind directions. The grey triangles all\nreflect observations of the same field taken about 2 hours before the meridian, and the black\ntriangles 2 hours after the meridian. However, given the scatter in the data, we cannot\nuniquely identify these minima with a particular wind layer.\nWe furthermore note that for each frame the minima, even after taking out the bulk\nellipticities through the pairwise subtractions, correlate with the direction of the bulk ellipticity (as given by the median ellipticity vector). The minima are found to be almost\nperfectly at right angles with the direction of largest ellipticity, and therefore closely align\nwith the ellipticity minor axis. So, for these particular Gemini observations it is clear that\nmost (if not all) of the bulk ellipticity observed in the frames is induced by the wind.\nGiven the predominant wind direction at Cerro Pachon and other sites, ellipticity residuals induced by the dominant wind layers are likely to persist over time. If an observing\nstrategy involved viewing a part of the sky at similar hour-angles and telescope orientations,\nthe result will be a persistent residual that will not diminish by averaging more images.\n\n3.2.\n\nEllipticity Correlations with seeing\n\nIn this section we describe how the atmosphere affects the ability to characterize a PSF\nat a particular location on the detector, where intrinsically round stellar objects can acquire\nan ellipticity for reasons set forth in Section 1. Obviously, the better we can measure this\nunwanted ellipticity component the better we can correct for it.\nThe ability to interpolate over the image depends, in part, on the stellar density and\natmospheric coherence. Under perfect seeing (and telescope) conditions a stellar wavefront\nis coherent and the PSF is known everywhere. Under finite seeing conditions the coherence\ndistance is also finite. Coherence distances less than 1\u2032 - the approximate separation of highaltitude galactic stars - would imply that there are locations in the image where the PSF\nis substantially unknown. This could impact weak lensing analyses, which relies on stellar\nobjects to predict the PSF of galaxies. For this reason one would like to first establish the\ncoherence distance as a function of seeing.\n\n\f\u2013 11 \u2013\nFigure 5 shows the vector ellipticity residuals of the 400 brightest stars as a function\nof separation for four frames spanning the range of seeing conditions in Table 1. Residuals\nare again constructed4 for each frame and placed into bins separated by \u223c 0.25\u2032. The\nmedian residual was extracted and plotted. For good seeing the residuals are small for\nsmall separations. These residuals grow with increasing separation, reflecting atmospheric\ndecoherence on these scales. This trend becomes less pronounced as the seeing gets worse.\nBy the time the seeing is \u2265 1\u2032\u2032 the atmospheric is largely decoherent at all separations.\nThis analysis addresses the PSF behavior at stellar locations and demonstrates that\nunder good seeing conditions the atmosphere exhibits some degree of coherence for small\nseparations. To explore more quantitatively the useful limit of seeing we turn to the issue of\nthe PSF behavior at an arbitrary location within the image. We choose two sets of stellar\nobjects: fiducial and fixed. In what follows the PSFs of fiducial objects are measured and\ncorrections are applied at the location of the fixed set. The density of the fiducial set is\nvaried by selecting progressively fewer stars. It should be noted that this selection is not\ncompletely random: we always include the brightest objects (i.e., the density is lowered by\nremoving the faintest stars first). This ensures that we are using the brightest and easiest to\nmeasure stars, mimicking the lensing pipeline methodology. This method also minimizes the\nimpact of photon shot noise limitations to the ellipticity (see \u00a7 3.2.1). Using these fiducial\nstars we predict the PSFs of the other fixed set of stellar objects by calculating the (distance)\nweighted mean PSF derived from the fiducial set.\nWe use a fixed set of 150 stellar PSF positions randomly distributed across the chip.\nFor each of these we calculate the vector ellipticity difference between the distance weighted\nmean PSF, calculated using a varying set of fiducial stars, and the actual PSF at these 150\npositions. The y-axis of Fig. 6 is the median value ellipticity residual for the fixed set of 150\nstars. The number of fiducial stars comprising the interpolation grid are varied from about\n400 down to about 5, corresponding to a spatial density range of \u223c 14 down to 0.2 stars per\nsquare arc minute (given our detector surface area of 29.2 square arcminutes).\nIn Fig. 6 we plot the results for frames 36, 40, 91, and 92, whose variables span the\nrange of observing conditions (cf. Table 1). The curve based on frame 36 represents the best\nobserving conditions (\u223c 0.7\u2032\u2032 seeing), and will be discussed first. This curve is flat across\nspatial densities between 10 down to 2 stars / \u0003\u2032 , only to turn upward at higher and lower\nspatial densities. The upturn with decreasing spatial density is due to the gradual onset of\nspatial decorrelation between the PSFs due to the atmosphere. With separations of more\nthan a few arc minutes the simple weighted interpolation invoked here poorly estimates PSF\n4\n\nWith e1 and e2 as defined in Eqs 2 and 3 now replacing ea and eb in Eq 9.\n\n\f\u2013 12 \u2013\nshapes. The upturn in the left part of the curve, on the other hand, is due to probable contamination by non-stellar objects (and their large intrinsic ellipticities) of the interpolation\ngrid, as well as ellipticity measurement limitations of faint stars due to shot noise. We come\nback to this issue shortly.\nIgnoring this high spatial density upturn, it is clear that with an interpolation grid of\nat least 1 star / \u0003\u2032 residuals are minimized within this type of interpolation scheme. As\nthe observation conditions worsen (as they do through frames 40, 91, and 92) ellipticity\nresiduals rise regardless of PSF surface density, reproducing the trend seen in Fig. 5. For\nthe (seemingly) pathological cases of frames 91 and 92, for which the PSF correlation length\nis essentially zero, we do not see an increase in the residuals with decreasing PSF surface\ndensity. Instead, we see a decrease due to the fact that in the lowest spatial density bins we\nonly consider the brightest stars in the frame, which happen to be the ones with the smallest\nmeasurement errors. The spatial PSF decorrelation in these frames is such that it does not\nmatter what PSF we use for our model.\n\n3.2.1. Shot Noise contributions\nTo address how well this interpolation scheme performs, artificial sky images were created using a realistic observing and instrumentation setup. We use SkyMaker software5 to\ncreate three sets of images. The first (labeled \"control 1\" in Fig. 6) uses the brightness\ndistribution found in frame 36. The other two images contained only stars of 20th and 15th\nmagnitude (control 2 and 3 respectively). All stars are generated with a FWHM of 0.7 \u2032\u2032\nbut no optical distortions are applied, hence the PSFs are perfectly round. Consequently,\nthe sole source of ellipticity is photon number statistics, i.e., shot noise. Furthermore, as we\nhave perfect PSF correlation across the chip, there should not be any trend with decreasing\nspatial PSF density. This is indeed what is seen in both controls 2 and 3 and the offset\nbetween these histograms is exactly what is expected from shot noise calculations. The fact\nthat control 1 slopes upwards is due to the inclusion of progressively fainter stars as one goes\nup in spatial density (the faintest stars in control 1 are 19th magnitude), which increases the\nshot-noise contribution.\nBased on these control curves we can conclude the following. With ellipticity residuals\non order of 0.02 (frame 36), we are within a factor of a few of the shot noise limit for \u223c\n19th magnitude stars, with the difference attributed to atmospheric turbulence. Second, for\nstellar surface densities of less than about 1/\u0003\u2032 this interpolation scheme is less successful.\n5\n\nhttp://terapix.iap.fr/\n\n\f\u2013 13 \u2013\nHowever, the roll-off is gradual, both in terms of PSF surface density and seeing conditions.\n\n3.3.\n\nFull lensing analysis\n\nEllipticity correlations as formulated above are a powerful measure of coherence and PSF\nbehavior, but are not expressed a form that is readily compared with a cosmological lensing\nsignal. Further, more precise correction procedures are available than that applied above.\nWe have chosen the Bernstein and Jarvis weak lensing analysis software (Bernstein & Jarvis\n2002) to correct stellar shapes for systematic effects. Much of the shape correction procedure\nis similar to that described in (Jarvis et al. 2003). However, not all elements of a pipeline\nexpressly designed to measure galaxy shapes apply here, where we restrict our attention to\nstellar objects. Those that do apply are described briefly below.\n1. Object Identification. All our analyses adopt SExtractor as their starting points. Aperture magnitudes and the zero-point magnitude suggested for GMOS are adequate for\nour purposes. Only well isolated stars having no associated error flags are selected.\n2. Shape measurement. Ellipticities measured by SExtractor serve as initial estimates\nfor more precise shape measurements based on second moments weighted by elliptical\nGaussians.\n3. Star Identification. Stars are discriminated from galaxies on the basis of size-magnitude\nconsiderations. To minimize the shot-noise contribution and further reduce contamination we selected the N brightest candidates.\n4. Convolution. A fiducial subset of these stars is chosen for rounding. The kernel required\nto round this subset is then interpolated to all other image locations. No correction is\nmade for PSF dilution as described in (Jarvis et al. 2003).\n5. Shape Remeasurement. With all stellar objects either directly or indirectly rounded\nvia interpolation the shapes are remeasured. We do not correct for centroid bias, nor\ndo we combine shape measurements.\nA similar but distinct analysis has been carried out with data from the Subaru telescope\non a single atmospheric realization (Wittman 2005). There it was found that atmosphereinduced residuals are a factor of \u223c 20 or so below the the target signal level. Here we extend\nthat study to a range of atmospheric conditions. The upper panel in Figure 7 shows the\ntwo-point correlation \u03c8, defined as\n\u03c8 = (\u01eb1 \u01eb1 + \u01eb2 \u01eb2 )/4\n\n(10)\n\n\f\u2013 14 \u2013\nfor various object lists processed through the pipeline. The solid line is the correlation\nfunction constructed from 512 uncorrected stars from Frame 36, resulting in a constant\n\u03c8 \u223c 0.002 line. The lack of features in this curve reflects the dominant ellipticity trend\nevident in the leftmost panel in Fig. 2. The dotted curve is constructed from a fiducial\nsubset of 122 rounded stars from that same frame. The dashed curve is again the correlation\nfunction of the same 512 stars, but with the fiducial subset of 122 stars now used for rounding\nand interpolation. The dashed-dotted curve is the correlation function constructed from 339\nsimulated stars that comprise the \"Control 1\" group of Fig. 6. Recall that \"Control 1\" can\nbe considered the same as frame 36 but without atmospheric distortions. The correlation\nfunctions generated in this manner are bounded from above by the raw ellipticities (black\ncurve) and from below by photon shot noise (dash-dotted curve), as expected.\nThe lower panel in Figure 7 was generated in an analogous manner to that used to\nproduce the dashed curve in the upper plot, but is carried out for frames 36, 40, 91 and\n92 using just 30 of the brightest stars in each frame as fiducial stars. The convolution\nwas then applied to the remaining stars. The roll off exhibited by each of the curves for\nseparations above a few arcseconds is understood in terms of the density of fiducial stars\n(\u223c 1/\u0003\u2032 to match the typical density of high-latitude stars). For separations below a few\narcseconds the correlations rise monotonically, reflecting the imperfect interpolation process\nbetween fiducial stars. However, even for the smallest separations this procedure results in\nan improvement on systematics shape 3-10 times over that in the raw images. Under all\nseeing conditions and for all separations the uncorrectable power \u03c8 is at worst a factor of\nfive or so below that of the expected lensing signal (Jain & Seljak 1997). For separations\nrelevant to present surveys (\u223c 1\u2032 or more) the systematic error arising from uncorrectable\natmospheric power (for good seeing) is of comparable magnitude to the statistical error (\u223c\n0.003) (Jarvis et al. 2006, Fig.1). The lack of an exact one-to-one correspondence between\nseeing and amplitude of the two-point correlation functions is attributed to fluctuations, as\nwell as variations in the number of test stars in the four frames.\n\n4.\n\nConclusions\n\nMany systematic effects will affect data from the next generation of weak lensing instruments. To understand the impact of the varying atmosphere we have acquired simultaneous\nimage and atmospheric data from the Gemini South telescope. The exposure time of 15 s,\nsite location and mirror diameter are matched to that of the proposed Large Synoptic Survey\nTelescope (Tyson et al. 2005).\nWe have studied the effects of atmospheric turbulence using three methods of increasing\n\n\f\u2013 15 \u2013\nsophistication and demonstrate that with seeing conditions up to \u223c 0.7\u2032\u2032 the PSF is coherent\nover appreciable angular scales. When seeing exceeds 1\u2032\u2032 , the atmosphere is largely decoherent over all angular scales. We find that these correlations are not isotropic. Rather,\nthere is a preferred direction, which we find to be induced by persistent wind layers. Unless somehow corrected for, this correlation will persist even after image stacking. Using a\nsimple interpolation technique and under good seeing conditions the PSF can be predicted\nto within a factor of a few of the theoretical (shot noise) limit. A complete weak lensing\nanalysis demonstrates that for data taken under less than ideal circumstances atmospheric\nresiduals can be reduced below that of the target cosmic shear signal. The presence of fiducial stars at a nominal density of \u223c 1/\u0003\u2032 provides for sufficient sampling of the image plane\nto compensate for atmospheric decoherence. Under the best seeing conditions we confirm\nan earlier result (Wittman 2005) and further note that the uncorrectable systematic errors\nare of the order of statistical errors associated with present lensing surveys. However, future\nsurveys will measure many more shapes and the statistical errors will be correspondingly\nreduced. Thus, the present level of systematic error must also be lowered, especially in the\nnon-linear regime. A priori, it is not obvious how one would commensurately lower the\nsystematic error attributed to the atmosphere using the procedure outlined in this paper\n(since the errors are proportional to the fixed density of stellar objects used to make shape\ncorrections). Fortunately, future surveys will revisit the same patch of sky multiple times\nand one can resort to shear-shear correlations computed from shear measured across frames\n(first discussed in Jarvis & Jain 2004). If these frames are well separated temporally (e.g. >\n20 s) then the atmospheric noise is purely stochastic and will not add systematic power to\nshape measurements (see Jain et al. 2006, for a methodology that minimizes the information\nlost from not computing shear correlations within an image).\nThis research is supported by the U.S. Department of Energy under contracts W-7405ENG-48.

(The x-axis curve (not shown) would appear identical,\nbut shifted by 90 degrees.) The frame numbers are indicated on the right. The telescope\nwas pointed approximately perpendicular to the ground wind direction in the bottom set\nof three curves, and along the wind direction in the top three. For each of the frames a\npreferred position angle exists for which the projected residuals are smallest along the y-axis\n(and consequently largest along the x-axis). This position angle can be interpreted as the\ndirection for which the wind induces the longest correlation length, and therefore smallest\nresiduals. The median stellar separation is 163\u2032\u2032 , with 25% of the pairs having separations\nless than 105\u2032\u2032.\n\n\f\u2013 18 \u2013\n\nFig. 4.- Direction of smallest ellipticity residuals.
