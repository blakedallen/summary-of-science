For a set T , we refer to all of its k-element subsets (k-sets for\n\u0001\n\u0001\nshort) as Tk and the number of such k-sets as |Tk | . We say that H = (V (H), E(H)) is an r-uniform\n\u0001\nhypergraph or r-graph for short, where V (H) is the set of vertices and E \u2282 V (H)\nis a family of\nr\nr-sets of V (H). When the graph referred to is clear from the context we will use V instead of V (H)\n\u0001\nand will identify H with E(H). For an r-graph H and a set D = {v1 , . . . , vd } \u2208 Vd , 1 \u2264 d \u2264 r,\nthe degree of D in H, degH (D) = degr (D) denotes the number of edges of H that contain D. For\n1 \u2264 d \u2264 r, let\n\u001a\n\u0012 \u0013\u001b\nV\n\u03b4d = \u03b4d (H) = min degr (D) : D \u2208\nd\nWe say that H(V1 , . . . , Vr ) is an r-partite r-graph, if there is a partition of V (H) into r sets, i.e.\nV (H) = V1 \u222a * * * \u222a Vr and every edge of H uses exactly one vertex from each Vi . We call it a\nbalanced r-partite r-graph if all Vi 's are of the same size. We say H(V1 , . . . , Vr ) is a complete\nr-partite r-graph if every r-tuple that uses one vertex from each Vi belongs to E(H). We denote a\ncomplete balanced r-partite r-graph by K (r) (t), where t = |Vi |. For r = 3, we refer to the balanced\n3-partite 3-graph H(V1 , V2 , V3 ), where |Vi | = 4 as a 4 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 4 3-graph.\n1\n\n\fFor an\nH, when A and B make a partition of V (H), for a vertex v \u2208 \u0010A we denote\nby\n\u0010 r-graph\n\u0001\u0011\n\u0001\u0011\nB\nB\ndegr v, r\u22121 the number of (r \u2212 1)-sets of B that make edges with v while er A, r\u22121 is the\n\u0010\n\u0010\n\u0010\n\u0001\u0011\n\u0001\u0011\n\u0001\u0011\n\u0001\nB\nB\nB\n|B|\nsum of degr v, r\u22121\nover all v \u2208 A and dr A, r\u22121\n= er A, r\u22121\n/|A| r\u22121\n. We denote by\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u0001\nB\n, such an r-graph, when all edges use one vertex from A and r \u2212 1 vertices from B.\nH A, r\u22121\n\u0010\n\u0001\u0011\nC\nis an r-graph where A, B and C make a partition of V (H), and every\nSimilarly H A, B, r\u22122\nedge in H uses one vertex each from A and B and r \u2212 2\u0010vertices from\nC. Degrees of vertices in A\n\u0001\u0011\nC\nand B are similarly defined as above.

We use the notation\ndr (H) \u2265 \u03b7 to refer to an \u03b7-dense r-graph H. For U \u2282 V , H|U is the restriction of H to U . For\nsimplicity we refer to dr (H|U ) as dr (U ) and to E(H|U ) as E(U ). A matching in H is a set of\ndisjoint edges of H and a perfect matching is a matching that contains all vertices. Moreover we\nwill only deal with r-graphs on n vertices where n = rk for some integer k, we denote this by\nn \u2208 rZ. Throughout the paper log denotes the base 2 logarithm.\ndr (A1 , (A2 \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 Ar )) =\n\nDefinition 1. Let d, r and n be integers such that 1 \u2264 d < r, and n \u2208 rZ. Denote by md (r, n)\nthe smallest integer m, such that every r-graph H on n vertices with \u03b4d (H) \u2265 m contains a perfect\nmatching.\nFor graphs (r = 2), by the Dirac theorem on Hamiltonicity of graphs, it s easy to see that\nm1 (2, n) \u2264 n/2, and since the complete bipartite Kn/2\u22121,n/2+1 does not have a perfect matching\nwe get m1 (2, n) = n/2. For r \u2265 3 and d = r \u2212 1, it follows from a result of R\u00f6dl, Ruci\u0144ski and\nSzemer\u00e9di on Hamiltonicity of r-graph [10] that mr\u22121 (r, n) \u2264 n/2 + o(n). K\u00fchn and Osthus [5]\n\u221a\nimproved this result to mr\u22121 (r, n) \u2264 n/2 + 3r2 n log n. This bound was further sharpened in [9]\nto mr\u22121 (r, n) \u2264 n/2 + C log n. In [11] the bound was improved to almost the true value, it was\nproved that mr\u22121 (r, n) \u2264 n/2 + r/4. Finally [12] settled the problem for d = r \u2212 1.\n2\n\n\fThe case d < r \u2212 1 is rather hard, in [7] it is proved that for all d \u2265 r/2, md (r, n) is close to\nFor 1 \u2264 d < r/2 in [2] it was proved that\n\u0012\n\u0013\u0012\n\u0013\nr\u2212d\nn\u2212d\nmd (r, n) \u2264\n+ o(1)\nr\nr\u2212d\n\n1 n\u2212d\n2 r\u2212d\n\n\u0001\n\n.\n\nA recent survey of these and other related results appear in [15]. In [2] the authors posed the\nfollowing conjecture.\nConjecture 1 ([2]). For all 1 \u2264 d < r/2,\n(\nmd (r, n) \u223c max\n\n1\n,1 \u2212\n2\n\n\u0012\n\nr\u22121\nr\n\n\u0013r\u2212d ) \u0012\n\u0013\nn\u2212d\nr\u2212d\n\nNote that for r = 4 and d = 1 the above bound yields\n\u0012\n\u0013\n37 n \u2212 1\nm1 (3, n) \u223c\n64\n3\nFor r = 3 and d = 1 this conjecture was proved in [13] and [6]. Markst\u00f6m and Ruci\u0144ski in [14]\nimproved the bound on md (r, n) for 1 \u2264 d < r/2 slightly, by proving\n\u0012\n\u0013\u0012\n\u0013\nr\u2212d\n1\nn\u2212d\nmd (r, n) \u2264\n\u2212 r\u2212d + o(1)\nr\nr\u2212d\nr\n\u0001\n\u0001\n42\nFurthermore for r = 4 and d = 1 in [14] the authors proved that m1 (4, n) \u2264 64\n+ o(1) n\u22121\n3 . In\nthis paper we settle Conjecture 1 for the case r = 4 and d = 1. The main result in this paper is\nthe following theorem.\nTheorem 1. There exist an integer n0 such that if H is a 4-graph on n \u2265 n0 (n \u2208 4Z) vertices,\nand\n\u0012\n\u0013 \u0012\n\u0013\nn\u22121\n3n/4\n\u03b41 (H) \u2265\n\u2212\n+1\n(1)\n3\n3\nthen H has a perfect matching.\nOn the other hand the following construction from [2] shows that this result is tight.\nConstruction 1. Let A and B be disjoint sets with |A| = n4 \u2212 1 and |B| = n \u2212 |A|. Let H =\n(V (H), E(H)) be a 4-graph such that V (H) = A \u222a B and E(H) is the set of all 4-tuples of vertices,\nT , such that |T \u2229 A| \u2265 1.\n\u0001\n\u0001\nWe have \u03b41 (H) = n\u22121\n\u2212 3n/4\n(the degree of a vertex in B) but since every edge in a matching\n3\n3\nmust use at least one vertex from A, the maximum matching in this graph is of size |A| = n4 \u2212 1\n3\n\n\f|A| = n4 \u2212 1\n\n|B| = 3n\n4 +1\n\nFigure 1: The extremal example: A Quadrilateral represent an edge. Every edge intersects the set A.\n\n1.1\n\nOutline of the proof\n\nWe distinguish two cases to prove Theorem 1. When H is 'far from' the extremal example as in\nConstruction 1 we use the absorbing lemma to find a perfect matching in H. The absorbing lemma\n(Lemma 10) roughly states, that any 3-graph H satisfying (1), contains a small matching M with\nthe property that every \"not too large\" subset of vertices can be absorbed into M . In Section 4, we\nfirst remove an absorbing matching M from H. Then using the tools developed in section 2 and\nthe auxiliary results of section 3, we find an almost perfect matching in H|V \\V (M ) . The left over\nvertices are absorbed into M to get a perfect matching in H. We will show that we can either find\nan almost perfect matching or H is in the extremal case.\nFor a constant 0 < \u03b1 < 1, we say that H is \u03b1-extremal, if the following is satisfied, otherwise it\nis \u03b1-non-extremal.\nDefinition 2 (Extremal Case with parameter \u03b1). There exists a B \u2282 V (H) such that\n\u0001\n\u2022 |B| \u2265 34 \u2212 \u03b1 n\n\u2022 d4 (B) < \u03b1.\nIn section 5, using a K\u00f6nig-Hall type argument, we build a perfect matching in H, when it is\n\u03b1-extremal.\n\n2\n\nMain tools\n\nWe use the following two easy observations that will, nevertheless, be useful later on.\n\n4\n\n\fFact 2. If G(A, B) is a 2\u03b7-dense bipartite graph, then there must be at least \u03b7|B| vertices in B for\nwhich the degree in A is at least \u03b7|A|.\nIndeed, otherwise the total number of edges would be less than\n\u03b7|A||B| + \u03b7|A||B| = 2\u03b7|A||B|\na contradiction to the fact that G(A, B) is 2\u03b7-dense.\nFact 3. If G(A, B) is a bipartite graph, |A| = c1 log n, |B| = c2 n and for every vertex b \u2208 B\ndeg(b, A) \u2265 \u03b7|A|, then we can find a complete bipartite subgraph G0 (A0 , B 0 ) of G such that A0 \u2282\nA, B 0 \u2282 B, |A0 | \u2265 \u03b7|A| and |B 0 | \u2265 c2 n(1\u2212c1 ) .\nTo see this consider the neighborhoods in A, of the vertices in B. Since there can be at most\n2|A| = nc1 such neighborhoods, by averaging there must be a neighborhood that appears for at\nleast nc2cn1 = c2 n(1\u2212c1 ) vertices of B. This means that we can find the desired complete bipartite\ngraph.\nThe main tool in this paper is the following result of Erd\u00f6s [4], on complete balanced r-partite\nsubhypergraphs of r-graphs.\nLemma 4. For every integer l \u2265 1 there is an integer n0 = n0 (r, l) such that: Every r-graph on\nr\u22121\nn > n0 vertices, that has at least nr\u22121/l\nedges, contains a K (r) (l).\nIn particular Lemma 4 implies that for \u03b7 > 0 and a sufficiently small constant \u03b2, if H is an r-graph\non n > n0 (\u03b7, \u03b2) vertices with\n\u0012 \u0013\nn\n|E(H)| \u2265 \u03b7\nr\nthen H contains a K (r) (t), where\nt = \u03b2(log n)1/r\u22121 .\nThis is so because \u03b7\n\nn\nr\n\n\u0001\n\n\u2265\n\nn1/\u03b2\n\nnr\nr\u22121 log n\n\n=\n\nnr\nr\u22121 ,\n21/\u03b2\n\nwhen \u03b7 >\n\n2r!\nr\u22121 .\n21/\u03b2\n\nThe following three lemmas are repeatedly used in section 4.\n\u0001\n3\nLemma 5. Let H(A, B3 ) be a 4-graph, |A| = c1 m, |B| = c2 2m , for some constants 0 < c1 , c2 < 1,\nif\n\u0012 \u0012 \u0013\u0013\nB\nd4 A,\n\u2265 2\u03b7\n3\nthen there exists a complete 4-partite 4-graph H 0 (A1 , B1 , B2 , B3 ), with A1 \u2282 A and B1 , B2 and B3\nare disjoint subsets of B such that |A1 | = |B1 | = |B2 | = |B3 | = \u03b7|A|.\n5\n\n\f\u0001\nProof. First apply Fact 2 to get a subset of 3-sets of vertices in B, T1 \u2282 B3 , such that every 3-set\n\u0001\nin T1 makes edges with at least \u03b7|A| vertices in A and |T1 | \u2265 \u03b7 |B|\n\u2265 \u03b7|B|3 /10. Next we find a\n3\nT2 \u2282 T1 , such that all 3-sets in T2 make edges with the same subset of A (say A1 \u2282 A). By Fact 3\nwe have\n\u0010\n\u00113\n2\n\u0012\n\u0013\nm3\nc\n2\n3\n2\n\u03b7|B| /10\n\u03b7\nc32 \u03b7 m3 (3\u2212c1 /m2 ) c32 \u03b7 |B| 3\u2212c1 /m\n2\n|T2 | \u2265\n=\n=\n2\n=\n\u2265 |B|3\u22121/(\u03b7|A|)\nc\nm\nc\nm\n1\n1\n2\n10 2\n10\n10\nc2\nwhere the last inequality follows when m is sufficiently large and \u03b7, c1 and c2 are small constants.\nNow construct an auxiliary 3-graph H1 where V (H1 ) = B and edges of H1 corresponds to 3-sets in\nT2 . Applying lemma 4 on H1 (for r = 3) we get a complete 3-partite 3-graph with color classes B1 ,\nB2 and B3 each of size \u03b7|A|. Clearly A1 , B1 , B2 and B3 corresponds to color classes of a complete\n4-partite 4-graph in H as in the statement of the lemma.\n\u0003\nLemma 6. Let H(A, B,\n0 < c1 , c2 < 1, if\n\nZ\n2\n\n\u0001\n\n3\n\n) be a 4-graph with |A| = |B| = c1 m, |Z| = c2 2m for some constants\n\u0012\n\u0012 \u0013\u0013\nZ\nd4 A, B,\n\u2265 2\u03b7\n2\n\nthen there exists a complete 4-partite 4-graph H 0 (A0 , B 0 , Z1 , Z2 ), with A0 \u2282 A, B 0 \u2282 B and\nZ1 and Z2 are disjoint subsets of Z such that |A0 | = |B 0 | = |Z1 | = |Z2 | = c log m for a constant\nc = c(c1 , c2 , \u03b7).\n\u0001\nProof. First apply Fact 2 to get a subset of pairs of vertices in Z, P1 \u2282 Z2 , such that every pair in\n\u0001\n2\nP1 makes edges with at least \u03b7|A||B| pairs of vertices in A \u00d7 B and |P1 | \u2265 \u03b7 |Z|\n2 \u2265 \u03b7|Z| /3. Next\nwe find a P2 \u2282 P1 , such that all pairs in P2 make edges with the same subset of pairs in A \u00d7 B (say\nQ1 \u2282 A \u00d7 B). By Fact 3 we have\n\u0010\n\u00112\n\u0012\n\u0013 2\nm3\nc\n2\n2\n\u03b7|Z| /3\n\u03b7 2\nc22 \u03b7 m3 (2\u2212c21 /m) c22 \u03b7 |Z| 2\u2212c1 /m\n|P2 | \u2265 (c m)2 =\n=\n2\n=\n\u2265 |Z|2\u22121/(log m)\n3 2(c1 m)2\n3\n3\nc2\n2 1\nwhere the last inequality follows when m is sufficiently large, and \u03b7, c1 and c2 are small constants.\nNow construct an auxiliary 2-graph G1 where V (G1 ) = Z and edges of G1 corresponds to pairs\nin P2 . Applying lemma 4 on G1 (for r = 2) we get a complete bipartite graph with color classes Z1\nand Z2 each of size log m.\nSimilarly construct an auxiliary bipartite graph G2 with color classes A and B, and edges of G2\ncorresponds to pairs in Q1 . Since we have |Q1 | \u2265 \u03b7|A||B| applying lemma 4 on G2 (for r = 2) we\n6\n\n\fget a complete bipartite graph with color classes A0 and B 0 , each of size c log m. Clearly A0 , B 0 and\na subset of vertices each from Z1 and Z2 of size |A0 | corresponds to color classes of the balanced\ncomplete 4-partite 4-graph in H as in the statement of the lemma.\n\u0003\nLemma 7. Let H(A, B, C, Z) be a 4-partite 4-graph with |A| = |B| = |C| = c1 m and |Z| = c2 2m\nfor some constants 0 < c1 , c2 < 1. If\n\n3\n\nd4 (Z, (A \u00d7 B \u00d7 C)) \u2265 2\u03b7\nthen there exists a complete 4-partite 4-graph H 0 (A0 , B 0 , C 0 , Z 0 ) such that |A0 | = |B 0 | = |C 0 | = |Z 0 | =\np\n\u03b2 log |A|.\nProof. First apply Fact 2 on H to get a subset Z1 of Z such that for every vertex z \u2208 Z1 , deg3 (z, (A\u00d7\nB \u00d7 C)) \u2265 \u03b7|A|3 and |Z1 | \u2265 \u03b7|Z|. Now consider the auxiliary bipartite graph G(D, Z1 ), where\nD = A \u00d7 B \u00d7 C and a vertex z \u2208 Z1 is connected to a 3-set (a, b, c) \u2208 D if (a, b, c, z) makes an edge\nof H. An application of Fact 3 on G gives a complete bipartite graph G2 (D0 , Z10 ) where\n|D0 | \u2265 \u03b7|A|3\n\nand\n\n3 (1\u2212c3 )\n1\n\nZ10 \u2265 \u03b7c2 2m\n\n> |A|\n\nwhen m is sufficiently large.\nLet G3 be a 3-partite 3-graph where the color classes are A, B and C and edges correspond to\n3-sets in D0 . Since |D0 | \u2265 \u03b7|A|3 applying Lemma 4 on G3 (r = 3), we get a balanced complete\np\n3-partite 3-graph in G3 with color classes A0 , B 0 and C 0 , such that |A0 | = |B 0 | = |C 0 | \u2265 \u03b2 log |A|.\nClearly A0 , B 0 , C 0 and a subset of Z10 of size |A0 |, correspond to the color classes of the required\ncomplete 4-partite 4-graph.\n\u0003\nWe will frequently apply the following folklore statements (proofs are omitted):\nLemma 8. Every graph H has a subgraph H 0 such that \u03b41 (H 0 ) \u2265 |E(H)|/|V (H)|.\n\u0001\nLemma 9. Every 3-graph H on n vertices, with \u03b41 (H) \u2265 \u03b7 n3 /n, has a matching of size \u03b7n/24.\nFinally we use the following lemma from [2].\nLemma 10. (Absorbing Lemma) For every \u03b7 > 0, there is an integer n0 = n0 (\u03b7) such that if H is\n\u0001\na 4-graph on n \u2265 n0 vertices with \u03b41 (H) \u2265 (1/2 + 2\u03b7) n3 , then there exist a matching M in H of\nsize |M | \u2264 \u03b7 4 n/4 such that for every set W \u2282 V \\ V (M ) of size at size at most \u03b7 8 n \u2265 |W | \u2208 4Z,\nthere exists a matching covering exactly the vertices in V (M ) \u222a W .\n7\n\n\f3\n\nAuxiliary results\n\nFor a 4 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 4 3-graph, denote by Q1 , Q2 , Q3 its 3 color classes and let Q1 = {a1 , a2 , a3 , a4 },\nQ2 = {b1 , b2 , b3 , b4 } and Q3 = {c1 , c2 , c3 , c4 }. For two vertices, x \u2208 Qi , y \u2208 Qj , i 6= j, N (x, y)\ndenotes the neighborhood of the pair x, y, i.e. the set of vertices in the third color class that\nmake edges with the pair x, y. Let deg(x, y) = |N (x, y)|. For two disjoint pairs (x1 , y1 ) and\n(x2 , y2 ) in Qi \u00d7 Qj , i 6= j the pairs (x1 , y2 ) and (x2 , y1 ) are called the crossing pairs and the value\ndeg(x1 , y2 ) + deg(x2 , y1 ) is referred to as the crossing degree sum. We define the following four\nspecial 4 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 4 3-graphs.\nDefinition 3. H432 is a 4 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 4 3-graph, such that there exist 3 disjoint pairs in a Qi \u00d7 Qj , i 6= j,\nwith degrees at least 4, 3 and 2 respectively.\nIn the figures the triplets joined by a line represent an edge in the 3-graph. Let the H432 be\nas in Figure 2(a) or Figure 2(b). If the H432 does not have a perfect matching then we must have\ndeg(b4 , c4 ) = 0, (as otherwise by the K\u00f6nig-Hall criteria we get a perfect matching).\n\nb1\na1\n\na2\n\nb2\n\nb3\na3\n\na4\n\n4\n\n3\n\n2\n\nb4\n\nb1\nc1\n\na1\n\nc2\n\na2\n\nb2\n\nb3\nc3\n\na3\n\nc4\n\na4\n\n(a) H432 with |N (b2 , c2 ) \u222a N (b3 , c3 )| = 3\n\n4\n\n3\n\n2\n\nb4\n\nc1\n\nc2\n\nc3\n\nc4\n\n(b) H432 with |N (b2 , c2 ) \u222a N (b3 , c3 )| = 4\n\nFigure 2: The two types of H432 . Labels on edges is the degree of the pair.\nDefinition 4. H4221 is a 4 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 4 tripartite 3-graph, such that there exist 4 disjoint pairs in a\nQi \u00d7 Qj , i 6= j, with degrees at least 4, 2, 2 and 1 respectively.\nLet the H4221 be as in Figure 3(a). If |N (b2 , c2 ) \u222a N (b3 , c3 ) \u222a N (b4 , c4 )| = 3 then again by the\nK\u00f6nig-Hall criteria we get that H4221 has a perfect matching. We only consider the H4221 that has\nno perfect matching.\n8\n\n\fDefinition 5. H3321 is a 4 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 4 3-graph, such that there exist 4 disjoint pairs in a Qi \u00d7 Qj ,\ni 6= j, with degrees at least 3, 3, 2 and 1 respectively (see Figure 3(b)).\n\nb1\na1\n\na2\n\nb2\n\n2\n\nb3\n\n2\n\na3\n\na4\n\n4\n\nb4\n\n1\n\nb1\nc1\n\na1\n\nc2\n\na2\n\nc3\n\na3\n\nc4\n\na4\n\n(a) H4221 with no perfect matching\n\n3\n\nb2\n\n3\n\nb3\n\n2\n\nb4\n\n1\n\nc1\n\nc2\n\nc3\n\nc4\n\n(b) H3321 with no perfect matching\n\nDefinition 6. Hext is a 4 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 4 3-graph with exactly 37 edges such that there are three vertices,\none in each of Q1 , Q2 and Q3 , and all edges are incident to at least one of these three vertices.\nThe following lemma that classifies, 4 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 4 3-graphs with at least 37 edges, will be very useful\nin the subsequent section.\nLemma 11. Let H(Q1 , Q2 , Q3 ) be a 4 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 4 3-graph. If |E(H)| \u2265 37 then one of the following\nmust be true\n1. H has a perfect matching.\n2. H has a subgraph isomorphic to H3321\n3. H has a subgraph isomorphic to H432\n4. H has a subgraph isomorphic to H4221\n5. H is isomorphic to Hext .\nProof. We consider the following cases based on degree of pairs in Qi \u00d7 Qj .\nCase 1: There is Qi and Qj , i 6= j such that no pair in Qi \u00d7 Qj has degree 4.\n9\n\n\fLet Q2 , Q3 be such a pair. Since |E(H)| \u2265 37 and no pair has degree 4, at least 5 out of the 16\npairs in Q2 \u00d7 Q3 must be of degree 3. Which implies that there must be at least 2 disjoint pairs of\ndegree 3. Consider the largest set of disjoint pairs of degree 3 in Q2 \u00d7 Q3 . Assume that there are\n3 disjoint pairs in Q2 \u00d7 Q3 of degree 3, say (b1 , c1 ), (b2 , c2 ) and (b3 , c3 ).\nIf deg(b4 , c4 ) \u2265 1, then we have a H3321 . So assume that deg(b4 , c4 ) = 0, The total number of\nedges incident to pairs in {b1 , b2 , b3 } \u00d7 {c1 , c2 , c3 } is at most 27 (as there are 9 pairs and degree\nof every pair is at most 3), the remaining at least 10 edges are incident to either b4 or c4 . Which\nimplies that there must be at least one pair (say (b3 , c3 )), such that crossing degree sum of (b3 , c3 )\nand (b4 , c4 ) is at least 4. Therefore we have that the degree of one crossing pair is at least 2 and\nthat of the other crossing pair is at least 1. These two crossing pairs together with (b1 , c1 ) and\n(b2 , c2 ) gives us a subgraph isomorphic to H3321 .\nOn the other hand, if there are exactly 2 disjoint pairs of degree 3, say (b1 , c1 ) and (b2 , c2 ).\nAgain the total number of edges incident to pairs in {b1 , b2 } \u00d7 {c1 , c2 } is at most 12 (as there\nare 4 pairs and degree of every pair is at most 3). If there is a pair in {b3 , b4 } \u00d7 {c3 , c4 } (say\n(b3 , c3 )) such that the crossing degree sum of (b1 , c1 ) and (b3 , c3 ) is at least 6, then since there is\nno degree 4 pair we must have that both deg(b1 , c3 ) and deg(c1 , b3 ) are 3. Now these crossing pairs\ntogether with (a2 , b2 ) are 3 disjoint pairs of degree 3 which is a contradiction to the maximality\nof the set of disjoint pairs of degree 3. Therefore we must have that the sum of degrees of pairs\nin {b1 , b2 } \u00d7 {c3 , c4 } and {c1 , c2 } \u00d7 {b3 , b4 } is at most 4 \u00d7 5 = 20. Hence the number of edges of\nH incident to pairs in {b3 , b4 } \u00d7 {c3 , c4 } is at least 37 \u2212 12 \u2212 20 = 5 and no pair has degree 3.\nTherefore, in {b3 , b4 } \u00d7 {c3 , c4 }, we can find two disjoint disjoint pairs, (say (b3 , c3 ) and (b4 , c4 ))\nwith degree at least 2 and 1 respectively and we get a graph isomorphic to H3321 .\nCase 2: There is a Qi and Qj , i 6= j such that exactly one disjoint pair in Qi \u00d7 Qj has degree 4.\nLet Q2 , Q3 be such a pair. Consider the largest set of disjoint pairs in Q2 \u00d7 Q3 with one pair of\ndegree 4 and the remaining of degree 3. Note that if there are two disjoint pairs of degree 3 besides\nthe degree 4 pair in the selected set, then clearly we have an H432 . So we consider the following\ntwo subcases based on whether or not there is a pair of degree 3 in the selected set. Let (b1 , c1 ) be\nthe degree 4 pair in the selected set.\nSubcase 2.1 There is another pair in Q2 \u00d7 Q3 disjoint from (b1 , c1 ) with degree 3.\nAssume that deg(b2 , c2 ) = 3. First observe that\n1. If any pair in {b3 , b4 } \u00d7 {c3 , c4 } has degree at least 2 then that pair together with (b1 , c1 ) and\n(b2 , c2 ) makes an H432 .\n10\n\n\f2. If both deg(b1 , c2 ) and deg(b2 , c1 ) are 4 then we get two disjoint degree 4 pairs. Therefore we\nhave that the number of edges incident to pairs in {b1 , b2 }\u00d7{c1 , c2 } is at most 4+3+4+3 = 14.\n3. If there is a pair in {b3 , b4 } \u00d7 {c3 , c4 } (say (b3 , c3 )) such that the crossing degree sum of (b2 , c2 )\nand (b3 , c3 ) is at least 5. Then we must have that one crossing pair is of degree at least 3, and\nthe other is of degree at least 2 (because none of them can be of degree 4). These 2 crossing\npairs together with (b1 , c1 ) makes the disjoint pairs of an H432 . Therefore we must have that\n(b2 , c2 ) and any pair in {b3 , b4 } \u00d7 {c3 , c4 } have their crossing degree sum at most 4.\n4. Similarly (b1 , c1 ) and any pair in {b3 , b4 } \u00d7 {c3 , c4 } have their crossing degree sum at most 6.\nAssume that (b1 , c1 ) and (b3 , c3 ) have their crossing degree sum, equal to 6. If the degrees of\ncrossing pairs are 4 and 2, then these crossing pairs and (b2 , c2 ) makes the disjoint pairs of an H432 .\nOn the other hand if both the crossing pairs have degree 3. Then (b1 , c3 ), (b3 , c1 ) and (b2 , c2 ) are\nthree disjoint pairs of degree 3. From observation 1 we have deg(b3 , c3 ) \u2264 1 and from observation\n3 the crossing degree sum of (b3 , c3 ) and (b2 , c2 ) is at most 4. Which together with observation\n2 gives us that the total number of edges incident to pairs in {b1 , b2 , b3 } \u00d7 {c1 , c2 , c3 } is at most\n14 + 6 + 1 + 4 = 25. Now if deg(b4 , c4 ) = 1 then we have an H3321 , otherwise we have that the\nnumber of edges containing either b4 or c4 is at least 37 \u2212 25 \u2265 12. By observation 1 we have that\nboth deg(b4 , c3 ) and deg(b3 , c4 ) are at most 1 hence we must have that the crossing degree sum of\n(b2 , c2 ) and (b4 , c4 ) is 4 with one crossing pair of degree at least 1 and the other of degree at least\n2. These crossing pairs together with (b1 , c3 ) and (b3 , c1 ) gives us an H3321 .\nOn the other hand if for any pair in {b3 , b4 } \u00d7 {c3 , c4 } and (b1 , c1 ) their crossing degree sum\nis be at most 5. Then the number of edges incident to pairs in {b3 , b4 } \u00d7 {c3 , c4 } is at least\n37 \u2212 14 \u2212 4(2) \u2212 5(2) = 5. Which implies that there must a degree 2 pair, and hence by observation\n1, we get an H432 .\nSubcase 2.2 There is no pair of degree 3 disjoint from (b1 , c1 ).\nIn this case again as in observation 2, the crossing degree sum of (b1 , c1 ) and any pair in\n{b2 , b3 , b4 } \u00d7 {c2 , c3 , c4 } is at most 6 (as any other case results in two disjoint pairs of degree 4 and\n3). This implies that the number of edges incident to pairs in {b2 , b3 , b4 } \u00d7 {c2 , c3 , c4 } is at least\n37 \u2212 4 \u2212 3(6) = 15 and no pair has degree 3. Which implies that there are three disjoint pairs in\n{b2 , b3 , b4 } \u00d7 {c2 , c3 , c4 } with degrees 2, 2 and at least 1 respectively. These pairs and (b1 , c1 ) makes\nthe 4 disjoint pairs of an H4221 .\nCase 3: In every Qi and Qj , i 6= j there are exactly two disjoint pairs in Qi \u00d7 Qj with degree 4.\n11\n\n\fConsider Q1 , Q2 and assume that (a1 , b1 ) and (a2 , b2 ) are the two disjoint pairs with degree 4.\nWe make the following observations:\n1. If any pair in {a3 , a4 } \u00d7 {b3 , b4 } has degree at least 2 then that pair together with (a1 , b1 ) and\n(a2 , b2 ) makes the disjoint pairs of an H432 . Therefore the total number of edges spanned by\npairs in {a3 , a4 } \u00d7 {b3 , b4 } is at most 4.\n2. For any of (a1 , b1 ) and (a2 , b2 ) and any pair in {a3 , a4 } \u00d7 {b3 , b4 } their crossing degree sum\ncan be at most 5. Indeed otherwise say the crossing degree sum of (a1 , b1 ) and (a3 , b3 ) is 6,\nthen we must have that one crossing pair has degree at least 3, and the other has degree at\nleast 2. These crossing pairs and (a2 , b2 ) make the disjoint pairs of an H432 . Furthermore if\nany such crossing degree sum is 5 then by the same reasoning as above, it must be that one\ncrossing pair is of degree 4 and the other is of degree 1.\n3. If the total number of edges spanned by pairs in {a1 , a2 } \u00d7 {b1 , b2 } is at most 12, then the\nnumber of edges that uses one vertex from {a1 , a2 , b1 , b2 } and one vertex from {a3 , a4 , b3 , b4 }\nis at least 37 \u2212 12 \u2212 4 = 21. Hence there will be a pair in {a3 , a4 } \u00d7 {b3 , b4 } (say (a3 , b3 )) such\nthat crossing degree sum of (a3 , b3 ) and at least one of (a1 , b1 ) and (a2 , b2 ) is at least 6, and\nby observation 2 we get an H432 .\nThe above observations are true for any two disjoint pairs of degree 4. We choose two disjoint pairs\nof degree 4, (say (a1 , b1 ) and (a2 , b2 )) pairs in Q1 \u00d7 Q2 such that (i) a1 has the maximum vertex\ndegree among all vertices that are part of some pairs of degree 4 and (ii) deg(a2 , b1 ) is as small\nas possible. Let deg(a2 , b1 ) = x. Note that by observation 3, we have x \u2265 1. We consider the\nfollowing cases based on the value of x.\nSubcase 3.1 x = 4\nNote that that the number of edges in {a1 , a2 } \u00d7 {b1 , b2 } is at most 16 (deg(a1 , b2 ) \u2264 4). First\nwe will show that both deg(a3 , b1 ), deg(a4 , b1 ) \u2264 1. Assume that deg(a3 , b1 ) \u2265 2, but then as in\nobservation 2 both deg(a1 , b3 ) and deg(a1 , b4 ) can be at most 2. Hence by the maximality of the\ndegree of a1 we get deg(a3 , b1 ) + deg(a4 , b1 ) \u2264 4. Now by observation 1, there must be at least\n37 \u2212 16 \u2212 4 \u2212 8 = 9 edges containing one vertex from {a3 , a4 , b3 , b4 } and one of {a2 , b2 }. Which\nimplies that the degree of a2 or b2 is strictly larger than that of a1 , a contradiction. So we have\ndeg(a3 , b1 ) = deg(a4 , b1 ) = 1.\nNow we show that both deg(a3 , b2 ), deg(a4 , b2 ) \u2264 1. To see this first assume that either\ndeg(a1 , b3 ) or deg(a1 , b4 ) is equal to 4, (say deg(a1 , b3 ) = 4) then by the minimality of x we must have\nthat deg(a2 , b3 ) = 4 too, because if deg(a2 , b3 ) < x, then we can exchange b1 with b3 to get a smaller\n12\n\n\fvalue of x. But if deg(a2 , b3 ) = 4 then by observation 2 we must have deg(a3 , b2 ) = deg(a4 , b2 ) = 1.\nOn the other hand if both deg(a1 , b3 ) and deg(a1 , b4 ) are at most 3 (deg(a1 , b3 ) + deg(a1 , b4 ) \u2264 6)\nthen again there must be at least 37 \u2212 16 \u2212 4 \u2212 8 = 9 edges containing some pair in {a2 } \u00d7 {b3 , b4 }\nand {a3 , a4 } \u00d7 {b2 }. Which means at least one of these pairs must be of degree at least 3. Say\ndeg(a2 , b3 ) \u2265 3, but then by observation 2 we have deg(a3 , b2 ), deg(a4 , b2 ) \u2264 1 and we are done. In\ncase say deg(a3 , b2 ) \u2265 3 then we have deg(a3 , b2 ) + deg(a4 , b2 ) \u2265 7 and we get that the degree of b2\nis larger than degree of a1 , a contradiction.\nSo we have that deg(a3 , b1 ), deg(a4 , b1 ), deg(a3 , b2 ) and deg(a4 , b2 ) \u2264 1. This together with\nobservation 1 implies that the number of edges containing some pair in {a1 , a2 } \u00d7 {b1 , b2 , b3 , b4 }\nis at least 37 \u2212 4 \u2212 4 = 29. Therefore the 2 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 4 3-graph H 0 ({b1 , b2 }, Q2 , Q3 ) has at least\n37 \u2212 4 \u2212 4 = 29 edges. There must be at least three vertices in Q2 such that each one of them is\npart of at least three pairs in (Q2 \u00d7 Q3 ) that are of degree at least 2. To see this assume that there\nare at most two such vertices in Q2 (say b1 and b2 ). Then using the fact that the maximum degree\nof a pair in Q2 \u00d7 Q3 in H 0 is 2, we get that b1 and b2 can be contained in at most 2(4 * 2) = 16 edges.\nWhile at most 2 pairs containing either b3 and b4 can be of degree 2, we get that the number of\nedges containing either b3 and b4 is at most 2 * (2 * 2 + 2 * 1) = 12 which implies that |E(H 0 )| \u2264 28\na contradiction\nNow since in Q2 there are at least 3 vertices such that each one of them is part of at least 3\npairs in (Q2 \u00d7 Q3 ) of degree at least 2. Which implies that there must a degree 2 pair disjoint from\nthe two degree 4 pairs (guaranteed in Case 3) in Q2 \u00d7 Q3 . Therefore we get an H432 .\nSubcase 3.2 x = 3\nNow we have that the number of edges in {a1 , a2 } \u00d7 {b1 , b2 } is at most 15. Again we first show\nthat both deg(a3 , b1 ), deg(a4 , b1 ) \u2264 1. Assume that deg(a3 , b1 ) \u2265 2, but then by observation 2 both\ndeg(a1 , b3 ) and deg(a1 , b4 ) can be at most 2. Hence by the maximality of the degree of a1 we get\ndeg(a3 , b1 ) + deg(a4 , b1 ) \u2264 5. Now by observation 1, there must be at least 37 \u2212 15 \u2212 4 \u2212 9 = 9 edges\ncontaining one vertex from {a3 , a4 , b3 , b4 } and one of {a2 , b2 }. Which implies that the degree of a2\nor b2 is strictly larger than that of a1 , a contradiction. So we have deg(a3 , b1 ) = deg(a4 , b1 ) = 1.\nSimilarly as in the previous case we show that both deg(a3 , b2 ), deg(a4 , b2 ) \u2264 1. To see this first assume that either deg(a1 , b3 ) or deg(a1 , b4 ) is equal to 4, (say deg(a1 , b3 ) = 4) then by the minimality\nof x we must have that deg(a2 , b3 ) \u2265 3 too. But if deg(a2 , b3 ) = 3 then by observation 2 we must\nhave deg(a3 , b2 ), deg(a4 , b2 ) \u2264 1. On the other hand if both deg(a1 , b3 ) and deg(a1 , b4 ) are at most 3\n(deg(a1 , b3 ) + deg(a1 , b4 ) \u2264 6) then again there must be at least 37 \u2212 15 \u2212 4 \u2212 8 = 9 edges containing\nsome pair in {a2 } \u00d7 {b3 , b4 } and {a3 , a4 } \u00d7 {b2 }. Which means at least one of these pairs must be of\ndegree at least 3. Say deg(a2 , b3 ) \u2265 3, but then by observation 2 we have deg(a3 , b2 ), deg(a4 , b2 ) \u2264 1\n13\n\n\fand we are done. In case say deg(a3 , b2 ) \u2265 3 then we have deg(a3 , b2 ) + deg(a4 , b2 ) \u2265 7 and we get\nthat the degree of b2 is greater than the degree of a1 , a contradiction.\nSo we have that deg(a3 , b1 ), deg(a4 , b1 ), deg(a3 , b2 ) and deg(a4 , b2 ) \u2264 1. Again we get that the\n2 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 4 3-graph H 0 ({b1 , b2 }, Q2 , Q3 ) has at least 37 \u2212 4 \u2212 4 = 29 edges. and we are done.\nSubcase 3.3 x = 2\nSimilarly as in the previous two subcases we have that deg(a3 , b1 ), deg(a4 , b1 ), deg(a3 , b2 ) and deg(a4 , b2 ) \u2264\n1 and the 2 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 4 3-graph H 0 ({b1 , b2 }, Q2 , Q3 ) has at least 37 \u2212 4 \u2212 4 = 29 edges and we are done.\nSubcase 3.4 x = 1\nIn this case observation 3 implies that the number of edges in {a1 , a2 } \u00d7 {b1 , b2 } is exactly 13\n(deg(a1 , b2 ) = 4). Using |E(H) \u2265 37| and observation 2 we get that every pair in {a3 , a4 } \u00d7 {b3 , b4 }\nhas degree exactly 1 and for any pair in {a3 , a4 } \u00d7 {b3 , b4 } and any of (a1 , b1 ) or (a2 , b2 ) their\ncrossing degree sum is exactly 5 (4 + 1).\nTherefore, we have that either\ndeg(a1 , b3 ) = deg(a1 , b4 ) = deg(a3 , b2 ) = deg(a4 , b2 ) = 4\n\nor\n\ndeg(a1 , b3 ) = deg(a1 , b4 ) = deg(a2 , b3 ) = deg(a2 , b4 ) = 4\nIn the latter case note that again we have that H 0 ({b1 , b2 }, Q2 , Q3 ) has at least 29 edges and we\nare done as above.\nSo assume that deg(a1 , b3 ) = deg(a1 , b4 ) = deg(a3 , b2 ) = deg(a4 , b2 ) = 4 and deg(a1 , b1 ) =\ndeg(a2 , b2 ) = deg(a1 , b2 ) = 4 and every other pair in Q1 \u00d7 Q2 is of degree exactly 1. This means\nthat a1 and b2 are not part of any degree 1 pair. Now the neighborhoods of all the degree 1 pairs\nmust be the same vertex in Q3 (say c3 ). Because otherwise we get a perfect matching in H, (using\nthose two vertices in Q3 for two disjoint degree 1 pairs, and the remaining two vertices of Q3 are\nmatched with two of the degree 4 pairs in (Q1 \u00d7 Q2 )). But if all of these edges are incident to c3 ,\nthen all edges in this graph are incident to at least one vertex in {a1 , b2 , c3 } and the number of\nedges is exactly 37, hence H is isomorphic to Hext .\n\u0003\n\nLet A, B and C be three disjoint balanced complete 4-partite 4-graphs with color classes (A1 , . . . , A4 ),\n(B1 , . . . , B4 ) and (C1 , . . . , C4 ) respectively, and |A1 | = |B1 | = |C1 | = m. Let Z be a set of vertices\ndisjoint from vertices in A, B and C. For a small constant \u03b7 > 0, we say that Z is connected to\n\n14\n\n\fa triplet of color classes (Ai , Bj , Ck ), 1 \u2264 i, j, k \u2264 4, if d4 (Z, (Ai \u00d7 Bj \u00d7 Ck )) \u2265 2\u03b7. For Z and\n(A, B, C) we define an auxiliary graph, (the link graph), Labc to be a 4 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 4 3-graph where the\nvertex set of each color class of Labc corresponds to the color classes in A, B and C. While a triplet\nof vertices (ai , bj , ck ) is an edge in Labc iff Z is connected to the triplet of color classes (Ai , Bj , Ck ).\nGiven three balanced complete 4-partite 4-graphs A, B and C and another set of vertices Z, as\nabove, we say that we can extend (A, B, C) if we can build another set of balanced complete 4partite 4-graphs using V (A) \u222a V (B) \u222a V (C) \u222a Z such that the total number of vertices in the new\n4-partite 4-graphs is at least 12m+\u03b7m/16 and the size of a color class in each new 4-partite 4-graph\n\u221a\nis \u03b2 log m. In what follows we outline a procedure to extend (A, B, C) using the structure of Labc .\nLemma 12. For \u03b7, c > 0, let A, B and C be three balanced complete 4-partite 4-graphs such that\n3\n|A1 | = |B1 | = |C1 | = m. If Z is a disjoint set of vertices with |Z| \u2265 c2m . If the link graph Labc\nhas at least 37 edges and Labc is not isomorphic to Hext then we can extend (A, B, C).\nProof. Since Labc is a 4 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 4 3-graph with at least 37 edges and is not isomorphic to Hext , for\neach of the other cases as in Lemma 11, we give the procedure to extend (A, B, C).\nCase 1: Labc has a perfect matching:\nWithout loss of generality assume that the perfect matching in Labc corresponds to {(Ai , Bi , Ci ) :\n1 \u2264 i \u2264 4} i.e. Z is connected to the triplets {(Ai , Bi , Ci ) : 1 \u2264 i \u2264 4}. Note that by the definition\nof connectedness and the sizes of the sets the 4-partite 4-graph (A1 , B1 , C1 , Z) satisfies the conditions\nof Lemma 7. Hence we find a complete balanced 4-partite 4-graph X1 = (A11 , B11 , C11 , Z 1 ), such\nthat\nZ 1 \u2282 Z, A11 \u2282 A1 , B11 \u2282 B1 and C11 \u2282 C1 and\np\n|Z 1 | = |A11 | = |B11 | = |C11 | = \u03b2 log m where \u03b2 is as in Lemma 7\nSimilarly, we find such complete balanced 4-partite 4-graphs X2 , X3 and X4 in (A2 , B2 , C2 , Z),\n(A3 , B3 , C3 , Z) and (A4 , B4 , C4 , Z) respectively, that are disjoint from each other (as |Z| is very\nlarge compared to m) (see Figure 3). We remove the vertices in X1 , X2 , X3 and X4 and make these\nfour new 4-partite 4-graphs. In the remaining parts of A, B and C we remove another such set of\n4 disjoint complete balanced 4-partite 4-graphs. Again by definition of connectedness and Lemma\n7 we can continue this process until we remove at least \u03b7m/8 vertices from each color class of A, B\nand C.\nNote that the new 4-partite 4-graphs use at least 4\u03b7m/8 vertices from Z. Therefore these new\n4-partite 4-graphs together with leftover parts of A, B and C have at least 3(4m) + \u03b7m/2 vertices\nwhile all the 4-partite 4-graphs are balanced. Hence, we extended (A, B, C).\n\n15\n\n\fZ\n\nA\n\nB\n\nC\nC1\n\nC2\n\nC3\n\nC4\n\nFigure 3: Extending (A, B, C) when Labc has a perfect matching: The shaded boxes represent a triplet connected\nto Z, while solid thick lines represent a balanced complete 4 partite graphs\nCase 2: Labc has a subgraph isomorphic to H432 :\nIn this case we show in detail how to extend such an (A, B, C), while in the latter cases we will\nonly briefly outline the procedure. First assume that the H432 in Labc is as in Figure 2(a) and let\nthe pairs corresponding to the degree 4, 3 and 2 pairs in this subgraph be (B1 , C1 ), (B2 , C2 ) and\n(B3 , C3 ) respectively. Furthermore let the color classes corresponding to the neighbors of degree 3\nand degree 2 pairs in H432 be {A2 , A3 , A4 } and {A3 , A4 } respectively.\n\nUsing the definition of connectedness and Lemma 7 we find two disjoint complete balanced 4-partite\n4-graphs X1 = (A14 , B31 , C31 , Z 1 ) and X2 = (A23 , B32 , C32 , Z 2 ) such that Z j , Aji , Bij , Cij are subsets of\nZ, Ai , Bi , Ci respectively.\nSimilarly we find three more disjoint balanced complete 4-partite 4-graphs X3 , X4 and X5 where\nvertices of three color classes in all of them are from B2 , C2 and Z while vertices of the fourth color\nclass are from A2 , A3 and A4 respectively. We build two more disjoint balanced complete 4-partite\n4-graphs X6 and X7 such that vertices of three color classes in both of them are from B1 , C1 and\nZ while vertices of the fourth color class are from A1 and A2 respectively.\n\u221a\nThe size of a color class in X1 , . . . , X7 is \u03b2 log m. We remove the vertices in X1 , . . . X7 from their\ncolor classes to make these 7 new 4-partite 4-graphs\n\nIn the remaining parts of A, B and C we remove another such set of seven disjoint balanced\ncomplete 4-partite 4-graphs that are disjoint from the previous ones.

By construction, if the number of vertices used from Bi and Ci , 1 \u2264 i \u2264 3 is t\n(= \u03b7m/8) then the number of vertices used in A2 , A3 and A4 is 5t/6, while that in A1 is t/2 (see\nFigure 4).\nNote that the new 4-partite 4-graphs use at least 3t \u2265 3\u03b7m/8 vertices from Z, but the remaining\nparts of A, B and C are not balanced (A1 , B4 and C4 have more vertices). To restore the balance\nin the remaining part of A we discard some arbitrary t/3 vertices from the remaining part of A1 .\nSimilarly we discard some arbitrary t vertices from B4 and C4 to restore the balance in the remaining\npart of B and C. Therefore the new 4-partite 4-graphs together with leftover parts of A, B and C\n(after discarding the vertices) have at least 4(|A1 | + |B1 | + |C1 |) + 3t \u2212 t/3 \u2212 2t \u2265 12m + \u03b7m/12\nvertices while all the 4-partite 4-graphs are balanced. Hence we extended (A, B, C).\nOn the other hand if the H432 in Labc is as in Figure 2(b), then let the color classes corresponding\nto the neighbors of degree 3 and degree 2 pairs in H432 be {A1 , A2 , A3 } and {A3 , A4 } respectively.\n17\n\n\fZ\n\nA\n\nB\n\nC\n4\nC1\n\n3\nC2\n\n2\nC3\n\nC4\n: t/2\n: t/4\n\nSymbols represent sizes\n\nFigure 5: Extending (A, B, C) when Labc has an H432 as in Figure 2(b): The shaded boxes represent a triplet\nconnected to Z, while solid thick lines represent a balanced complete 4 partite 4-graphs\n\nIn this case extend (A, B, C) as follows.\nFor the pair (B3 , C3 ) we remove two balanced complete 4-partite 4-graphs with the fourth color\nclasses in A3 and A4 respectively. For the pair B2 , C2 we remove two balanced complete 4-partite\n4-graphs with the fourth color classes in A1 and A2 respectively. The size of of each color class in\n\u221a\nall of these new 4-partite graphs is \u03b2 log m. Since the pair (B1 , C1 ) has degree 4, we remove four\nbalanced complete 4-partite 4-graphs with the fourth color class in A1 , A2 , A3 and A4 respectively.\nSimilarly as in the previous case we repeat this process so that we remove at least t \u2265 \u03b7m/8\nvertices from each Bi and Ci , 1 \u2264 i \u2264 3. Note that by construction we have used 3t/4 vertices in\neach color class of A (see Figure 5). So the remaining part of A is still balanced. While to restore\nbalance in the remaining parts of B and C, we discard some arbitrary t vertices from each of B4\nand C4 . Again in total we added 3t vertices from Z, while we discarded 2t vertices form B4 and C4 .\nTherefore the net increase in the number of vertices in the new set of complete 4-partite 4-graphs\nis t \u2265 \u03b7m/8, while all the 4-partite 4-graphs are balanced.\n18\n\n\fCase 3: Labc has a subgraph isomorphic to H4221 :\nWithout loss of generality, assume that the pairs corresponding to the degree 4, 2, 2 and 1 pairs\nin this H4221 are (B1 , C1 ), (B2 , C2 ), (B3 , C3 ) and (B4 , C4 ) respectively. Furthermore let the color\nclasses corresponding to the neighbors of degree 1 and the two degree 2 pairs in H4221 be {A4 },\n{A3 , A4 } and {A3 , A4 } respectively (as in Figure 3(a)).

Note that with this process we have\nused 3t/2 vertices in A3 and A4 while t/2 vertices each in A1 and A2 (see Figure 6). Furthermore\nonly the remaining part of A is not balanced. The balance can be restored by discarding t vertices\neach from the remaining part of A1 and A2 which results in the net increase of 2t \u2265 \u03b7m/12 vertices\nin all the balanced complete tripartite graphs.\n19\n\n\fCase 4: Labc has a subgraph isomorphic to H3321 :\nAssume that the pairs corresponding to the degree 3, 3, 2 and 1 pairs in the H3321 are (B1 , C1 ),\n(B2 , C2 ), (B3 , C3 ) and (B4 , C4 ) respectively. Let the color classes corresponding to the neighbors of\nthese pairs in H3321 be {A2 , A3 , A4 }, {A2 , A3 , A4 }, {A3 , A4 } and {A4 }.

We repeat this process so as to remove at least t \u2265 3\u03b7m/64 vertices\neach from each color class of B and C. Clearly the remaining part of B and C are still balanced,\nwhile in A we have used 4t/3 vertices in each of A2 , A3 and A4 . To restore the balance in remaining\npart of A we discard arbitrary 4t/3 vertices from A1 . In the process the net increase in the number\nof vertices in the resultant balanced 4-partite 4-graphs is at least 8t/3 \u2265 3\u03b7m/8, hence (A, B, C) is\nextended.\n\u0003\nZ\n\nA\n\nB\n\n3\n\nC\nC1\n\n3\nC2\n\n2\nC3\n\n1\nC4\nSymbols represent sizes\n\n: t/3\n: t\n\nFigure 7: Extending (A, B, C) when Labc has an H3321 : The shaded boxes represent a triplet connected to Z, while\nsolid thick lines represent a balanced complete 4 partite 4-graphs\n\n20\n\n\f4\n\nThe Non Extremal Case\n\nThroughout this section we assume that we have a 4-graph H satisfying (1) such that the extremal\ncase does not hold for H. We shall assume that n is sufficiently large and besides our main\nparameter \u03b3 we use the parameters \u03b2 and \u03b1 such that the following holds\n12\n21/\u03b2 2\n\n< \u03b3 = \u03b14 \u001c 1\n\n(2)\n\nwhere a \u001c b means that a is sufficiently small compared to b. From (1) and (2), when n is large\nwe have\n\u0012\n\u0013 \u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012 \u0013\n\u221a \u0001 n\nn\u22121\n3n/4\n37 n \u2212 1\n9n2\n\u03b41 (H) \u2265\n\u2212\n+1>\n\u2212\n> 1/2 + 2 \u03b1\n3\n3\n64\n3\n64\n3\nHence our hypergraph H satisfies the conditions of Lemma 10 (the absorbing lemma). We remove\n\u221a\nfrom H an absorbing matching M of size at most \u03b12 n/4 = \u03b3n/4. In the remaining hypergraph we\nfind an almost perfect matching that leaves out a set of at most \u03b14 n = \u03b3n vertices. As guaranteed\nby Lemma 10 the vertices that are left out from the almost perfect matching can be absorbed\ninto M , therefore we get a perfect matching in H. In what follows we work with the remaining\nhypergraph (after removing V (M )). For simplicity we still denote the remaining hypergraph by H\n\u221a\nand assume that it is on n vertices. Since |V (M )| \u2264 \u03b3n, in the remaining hypergraph we still\nhave\n\u0012\n\u0013\u0012 \u0013\n37\nn\n\u221a\n\u03b41 (H) \u2265\n\u22126 \u03b3\n(3)\n64\n3\n\u0001\n\u221a\nas for any vertex v in the remaining hypergraph, there can be at most 6 \u03b3 n3 edges containing v\nand at least one vertex in V (M ).\n\n4.1\n\nThe optimal cover\n\nOur goal is to find an almost perfect matching in H. We are going to build a cover F = {Q1 , Q2 , . . .},\nsuch that, each Qi is a disjoint balanced complete 4-partite 4-graph in H (we refer to them as 4partite graphs). We say that such a cover is optimal if it covers at least (1 \u2212 \u03b3)n vertices. We will\nshow that either we can find an optimal cover or H is \u03b1-extremal. It is easy to see that such an\noptimal cover readily gives us an almost perfect matching.\nUsing the following iterative procedure, we either build an optimal cover or find a subset of\nvertices, which shows that H is \u03b1-extremal. We begin with a cover F0 . Then in each step t \u2265 1, if\nFt\u22121 is not optimal, we find another cover Ft , such that |V (Ft )| \u2265 |V (Ft\u22121 )| + \u03b3 2 n/16 (for this we\nuse the notation, Ft > Ft\u22121 ). The size of a color class in each 4-partite graph in Ft is mt .\n21\n\n\fTo get the initial cover, F0 , we repeatedly apply Lemma 4 in the leftover of H, while the\nconditions of the lemma are satisfied and the number of leftover vertices are at least \u03b3n, to find\n4-partite graphs, K (4) (m0 ), where m0 = \u03b2(log n)1/3 . After the tth step in this iterative procedure,\nif Ft is not an optimal cover, then we get Ft+1 . We will show that, unless H is \u03b1-extremal, we have\n\u221a\nFt+1 > Ft and mt+1 = \u03b2 log mt . Let It = V (H) \\ V (Ft ). Since Ft is not optimal and we cannot\napply Lemma 4 in H|It , we must have that |It | \u2265 \u03b3n and\nd4 (It ) < \u03b3.\n\n(4)\n\nBy non-extremality of H, this implies that |V (F0 )| \u2265 n/4.\n\nIn what follows we will show that if there are 'many' edges with three vertices in It and one vertex\nin some Qi \u2208 Ft then we get Ft+1 > Ft . To that end let Qi = (V1i , V2i , V3i , V4i ) be a 4-partite graph\n\u0001\nin Ft , we say that a color class, Vpi of Qi , (1 \u2264 p \u2264 4) is connected to It , if d4 (Vpi , I3t ) \u2265 2\u03b3. We will\nshow that if a 4\u03b3-fraction of the 4-partite graphs in Ft have at least 2 color classes connected to It ,\nthen we can we get Ft+1 > Ft . To see this assume that we have a subcover F 0 \u2282 Ft , such that each\nQi \u2208 F 0 has at least 2 color classes connected to It and |V (F 0 )| \u2265 \u03b3n. Let F 0 = {Q1 , Q2 , . . .} \u2282 Ft\nand without loss of generality, say V1i and V2i are the color classes in each Qi that are connected to\nIt . For each such Qi , since |V1i | = |V2i | = mt \u2264 \u03b2(log n)1/3 and |It | \u2265 \u03b3n, by Lemma 5 we can find\ntwo disjoint balanced complete 4-partite graphs (U1i , Ai1 , B1i , C1i ) and (U2i , Ai2 , B2i , C2i ) where U1i and\nU2i are subsets of V1i and V2i respectively, and Aik , Bki and Cki , k \u2208 {1, 2} are disjoint subsets of It .\nThe size of each color class of these new 4-partite graphs is at least \u03b3mt /4 (see Figure 8).\nV1i\n\nV2i\n\nV3i\n\nV4i\n\nQi\n\nIt\n\nFigure 8: V1i and V2i of Qi are connected to It . The Shaded quadrilaterals represent density, while the dark black\nquadrilateral is balanced complete 4-partite 4-graph\n\nWe remove the vertices of these new 4-partite graphs from their respective sets and add them\n22\n\n\fto Ft+1 . Removing these vertices from V1i and V2i creates an imbalance in the leftover part of Qi\n(V3i and V4i have more vertices). To restore the balance, we discard (add to It ) some arbitrary\n|U1i | = |U2i | vertices each from V3i and V4i . The new 4-partite graphs use 6\u03b3mt /4 vertices from It .\nTherefore even after discarding the vertices from V3i and V4i the net increase in the size of our cover\nis \u03b3mt , while all the 4-partite graphs are balanced. We repeat this procedure for every Qi \u2208 F 0 and\nadd the leftover part of Qi and all 4-partite graphs in Ft \\ F 0 , to Ft+1 . Now, we split each 4-partite\ngraph in Ft+1 into disjoint balanced complete 4-partite graphs, such that each has a color class of\n\u221a\nsize mt+1 = \u03b2 log mt (we assume divisibility). Since |V (F 0 )| \u2265 \u03b3n, by the above observation, we\nhave |V (Ft+1 )| \u2265 |V (Ft )| + \u03b3 2 n, hence Ft+1 > Ft .\nSimilarly, if there are 'many' edges that uses two vertices in It and two vertices from V (Ft )\nthen we get Ft+1 > Ft . First note that the number of pairs of vertices of any 4-partite graph\nQi \u2208 Ft is O(log n)2/3 , so the number of pairs of vertices within the 4-partite graphs in Ft is\n\u0001\nO(n(log n)2/3 ) = o n2 . Therefore the total number of edges, containing two vertices within a\n\u0001\nQi \u2208 Ft and two vertices in It is o n4 , hence we ignore such edges. Let Qi = (V1i , V2i , V3i , V4i ) and\nQj = (V1j , V2j , V3j , V4j ) be a pair of 4-partite \u0010graphs in Ft\u0011we say that It is connected to a pair of\n\u0001\n\u2265 2\u03b3. We say that It is k-sided to a\ncolor classes (Vpi , Vqj ), (1 \u2264 p, q \u2264 4), if d4 Vpi , Vqj , I2t\n\u0001\nFt\npair (Qi , Qj ) \u2208 2 if It is connected to k-pairs in {V1i , V2i , V3i , V4i } \u00d7 {V1j , V2j , V3j , V4j }. Assume\n\u0001\nthat It is at least 9-sided to a 4\u03b3-fraction of pairs of 4-partite graphs in F2t . By a simple greedy\n\u0001\nprocedure, (Lemma 8 and the 2-graph analog of Lemma 9) we get a disjoint set of pairs, M 0 \u2282 F2t ,\nsuch that for each pair (Qi , Qj ) \u2208 M 0 , It is at least 9-sided to (Qi , Qj ) and the number of vertices\ncovered by M 0 is at least \u03b3n.\nFor every (Qi , Qj ) \u2208 M 0 we proceed as follows: Since It is connected to at least 9 pairs of color\nclasses in {V1i , V2i , V3i , V4i } \u00d7 {V1j , V2j , V3j , V4j }, it is easy to see that we can find 3 disjoint pairs\nof color classes such that It is connected to each of them (say (V1i , V1j ), (V2i , V2j ) and (V3i , V3j ) are\n1/3 and |I | \u2265 \u03b3n, so\nsuch disjoint pairs of color classes). We have |V1i | = |V1j |\u0010= mt \u2264 \u03b2(log\nt\n\u0011 n)\n\u0001\nj\nI\ni\nt\nby definition of connectedness, the induced hypergraph, H V1 , V1 , 2\nsatisfies the conditions of\nLemma 6. Therefore by Lemma 6 we remove balanced complete 4-partite 4-graphs, such that each\nof them has one color class in V1i , one in V1j and two color classes in It . Note that the conditions\nof Lemma 6 are satisfied until in total we remove at least \u03b3mt /2 vertices each from V1i and V1j .\nWe repeat the same process with (V2i , V2j ) and (V3i , V3j ) (see Figure 9). In total these new balanced\ncomplete 4-partite 4-graphs use 3\u03b3mt vertices from It and when we remove the vertices of the new\n4-partite graphs, from Qi and Qj the remaining parts of Qi and Qj are not balanced (V4i and V4j\nhave extra vertices). To restore the balance we remove an arbitrary set of vertices each from V4i\nand V4j (equal to the difference in color classes). Still the net increase in the number of vertices in\nthe cover is at least 2\u03b3mt .\n23\n\n\fQj\n\nV1j\n\nV2j\n\nV3j\n\nV4j\n\nV1i\n\nV2i\n\nV3i\n\nV4i\n\nQi\n\nIt\n\nFigure 9: The pair (Qi , Qj ) is at least 9-sided to It . The Shaded quadrilaterals represent density, while the dark\nblack quadrilateral is balanced complete 4-partite 4-graph\n\nApplying this procedure for every (Qi , Qj ) \u2208 M 0 and making all of the 4-partite graphs of the\nsame size, by splitting, we get Ft+1 . Again we have all 4-partite graphs balanced with color classes\n\u221a\nof size mt+1 = \u03b2 log mt and Ft+1 > Ft .\nNow, if we can not get Ft+1 > Ft , we must have that, in almost all 4-partite graphs in Ft , at\n\u0001\nmost one color class is connected to It and almost all pairs of 4-partite graphs in F2t are at most\n8-sided. In particular this implies that for a typical vertex v \u2208 It we have\n\u0013\n\u0012 \u0013\n\u0012 \u0012 \u0013\n\u0013 \u0012\n|It |\nIt\n1\ndeg4 v,\n\u00d7 V (Ft ) \u2264\n+ 6\u03b3 |V (Ft ) |\n4\n2\n2\nand\n\n\u0012\n\u0012\n\u0013\u0013 \u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\nV (Ft )\n1\n|V (Ft ) |\ndeg4 v, It \u00d7\n\u2264\n+ 16\u03b3 |It |\n.\n2\n2\n2\n\n24\n\n\fFrom (3), (4) and the above degree bounds, for a typical vertex v \u2208 It we have\n\u0012 \u0012\n\u0013\u0013\nV (Ft )\ndeg4 v,\n3\n\u0012 \u0012 \u0013\u0013\n\u0013\n\u0012 \u0012 \u0013\n\u0012\n\u0012\n\u0012\n\u0013\u0013\n\u0013\u0012 \u0013\nIt\nIt\n37\nV (Ft )\nn\n\u221a\n\u00d7 V (Ft ) \u2212 d4 v,\n\u2265\n\u2212 d4 v,\n\u22126 \u03b3\n\u2212 d4 v, It \u00d7\n3\n2\n64\n2\n3\n\u0012\n\u0013\u0012 \u0013 \u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013 \u0012\n\u0013\u0012 \u0013\n\u0012 \u0013\n37\nn\n1\n|V (Ft )|\n1\n|It |\n|It |\n\u221a\n\u2265\n\u22126 \u03b3\n\u2212\n+ 16\u03b3 |It |\n\u2212\n+ 6\u03b3\n|V (Ft )| \u2212 \u03b3\n64\n3\n2\n2\n4\n2\n3\n\u0012\n\u0013\u0012\n\u0013\n37\n|V (Ft )|\n\u221a\n\u2265\n\u2212 30 \u03b3\n64\n3\nwhere the last inequality holds when |It | \u2265 \u03b3n and |V (Ft )| \u2265 n/4.\nFor a vertex v, consider the edges that v makes with 3-sets of vertices within a Qi \u2208 Ft . The\nnumber of 3-sets of vertices of any Qi \u2208 Ft is O(log n), (as the size of Qi is at most \u03b2 log1/3 n),\n\u0001\nhence the total number of 3-sets of vertices within the 4-partite graphs in Ft is O(n log n) = o n3 .\nSimilarly the number of 3-sets of vertices which uses 2 vertices from a Qi and one vertex from\n\u0001\nsome other Qj is O(n2 log n) = o n3 . Therefore, for any vertex v, we ignore these types of edges\nand we will only consider the edges that v makes with 3-sets of vertices (x, y, z), x \u2208 V (Qi ), y \u2208\nV (Qj ), z \u2208 V (Qk ), i 6= j 6= k. By the above observation, for the minimum degree of a typical\nvertex v \u2208 It we still have\n\u0013\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012 \u0012\n\u0013\u0013 \u0012\n|V (Ft )|\nV (Ft )\n37\n\u221a\n(5)\n\u2212 40 \u03b3\ndeg4 v,\n\u2265\n3\n64\n3\nLet Qi = (V1i , . . . , V4i ), Qj = (V1j , . . . , V4j ) and Qk = (V1k , . . . , V4k ) be three 4-partite graphs in Ft ,\nwe say that It is connected to a triplet of color classes (Vpi , Vqj , Vrk ), 1 \u2264 p, q, r \u2264 4, if d4 (It , (Vpi \u00d7\n\u0001\nVqj \u00d7 Vrk )) \u2265 2\u03b3. For (Qi , Qj , Qk ) \u2208 F3t we consider the link graph Lijk as defined above (with It\nplaying the role of the set Z).\nFor a constant \u03b7 > 0, we say that It is (\u03b7, s)-connected to Ft , if there is a subset of triplets of\n\u0001\n4-partite graphs, T \u2282 F3t , such that for each triplet (Qi , Qj , Qk ) \u2208 T , the link graph, Lijk has s\n\u0001\nedges and |T | \u2265 \u03b7 |F3t | .\nA simple calculation, using (5), implies that if It is (\u03b3 1/3 , s)-connected to Ft for some s \u2264 36,\n\u221a\nthen we also have that It is ( \u03b3, \u2265 38)-connected to Ft .\nWe consider the following cases based on the way It is connected to Ft and show that either\nwe get Ft+1 > Ft or H is extremal. First assume that It is (32\u03b3, \u2265 37)-connected to Ft such that\nfor every triplet (Qi , Qj , Qk ) \u2208 T , the link graph Lijk is not isomorphic to Hext . Then by lemma 8\n25\n\n\fand lemma 9 there exists a set a disjoint set of triplets of 4-partite graphs, T 0 \u2282 T , such that for\neach triplet (Qi , Qj , Qk ) \u2208 T 0 the link graph Lijk has at least 37 edges and is not isomorphic to\nHext . Furthermore, the number of vertices covered by T 0 is at least \u03b3n.\nNow, for each (Qi , Qj , Qk ) \u2208 T 0 , since Lijk has at least 37 edges and Lijk 6= Hext , using Lemma\n12 we extend (Qi , Qj , Qk ) to add at least \u03b3mt /16 vertices to our cover. Clearly if we extend every\ntriplet in T 0 the net increase in the size of our cover is at least \u03b3 2 n/16 (as the size of T 0 is at least\n\u03b3n). Similarly as above we can split the 4-partite graphs to make them of the same size and get\nFt+1 > Ft .\nOn the other hand, if there is no such T , then we must have that It is not (\u03b3 1/3 , s)-connected to Ft\nfor any s \u2264 36, because otherwise, as observed above, we will get such a T . So, roughly speaking,\n\u0001\nfor almost all triplets of 4-partite graphs in F3t , we have that the link graph of the triplet has\nexactly 37 edges and is isomorphic to Hext . Call a 4-partite graph Qi \u2208 Ft good, if for almost all\npairs of other 4-partite graphs Qj , Qk , we have that the link graph Lijk is isomorphic to Hext .\nBy the above observation, almost all 4-partite graphs (covering \u2265 (1 \u2212 2\u03b3 1/3 )|V (Ft )| vertices)\nare good. By a simple greedy procedure we find a set of disjoint triplets of 4-partite graphs, Tg ,\nsuch that for each triplet (Qi , Qj , Qk ) \u2208 Tg , the link graph Lijk is isomorphic to Hext and all good\n4-partite graphs are part of some triplet in Tg . Let the set of 4-partite graphs covered by Tg be\nFg , clearly |V (Fg )| \u2265 (1 \u2212 2\u03b3 1/3 )|V (Ft )|. With relabeling we may also assume that in each triplet\n(Qi , Qj , Qk ) \u2208 Tg , V1i , V1j and V1k are the color classes corresponding to the vertices of the link\ngraph Lijk that intersect every edge of Lijk .\nFor every (Qi , Qj , Qk ) \u2208 Tg , by definition of connectedness and the sizes of the Qi , Qj and Qk ,\nthe 4-partite hypergraph induced by (V1i , V2j , V2k , It ) satisfies the conditions of Lemma 7. Hence\napplying Lemma 7 we find a balanced complete 4-partite graphs Xi1 in H(V1i , V2j , V2k , It ). We also\nfind two more disjoint balanced complete 4-partite graphs, Xi2 and Xi3 in H(V1i , V3j , V3k , It ) and\nH(V1i , V4j , V4k , It ). Since |It | \u2265 \u03b3n, we can find these complete 4-partite graphs that are disjoint\n\u221a\nfrom each other. The sizes of a color class in each of X11 , X12 and X13 is \u03b2 log mt .\nSimilarly for each of V1j and V1k we find 3 disjoint balanced complete 4-partite graphs Xjp\nand Xkp in H(Vpi , V1j , Vpk , It ) and H(Vpi , Vpj , V1k , It ), (2 \u2264 p \u2264 4), respectively. All of these these\nbalanced complete 4-partite graphs are disjoint from each other and the size of a color class in each\n\u221a\none of them is \u03b2 log mt .\nBy the definition of connectedness, the structure of the link graph Lijk and the fact that\n|It | \u2265 \u03b3n, clearly we can find these nine disjoint 4-partite graphs. And as argued above we repeat\nthis process (remove another set of 9 such 4-partite graphs) until in total we remove \u03b3mt /2 vertices\n26\n\n\ffrom each of V1i , V1j and V1k , while \u03b3mt /3 vertices from each of the other classes in Qi , Qj and Qk .\nNote that these tripartite graphs in total use 3\u03b3mt /2 vertices from It . But this creates an\nimbalance among the color classes of the remaining parts of Qi , Qj and Qk (V1i , V1j and V1k have\nfewer vertices), to restore the balance we will have to discard \u03b3mt /6 vertices from each color class\nin Qi , Qj and Qk except V1i , V1j and V1k . Which leaves us with no net gain in the size of the cover.\nTherefore we will not discard any vertices from these color classes at this time and say that these\ncolor classes have extra vertices. We proceed in similar manner for each triplet in Tg . So we have\nabout \u03b3n/24 extra vertices altogether.\nDenote by V1g , V2g , V3g and V4g the union of the corresponding color classes of remaining parts of 4partite graphs in Fg . Clearly |V2g | = |V3g | = |V4g | \u2265 (1 \u2212 2\u03b3 1/3 )|V (Ft )|/4 \u2212 \u03b3n/24 \u2265 (1/16 \u2212 3\u03b3 1/3 )n.\nThe last inequality follows from the lower bound on size of V (Ft ) above, and the fact that \u03b3 is a\nsmall constant. We will show that either we can increase the size of our cover or we have\n\u221a\nd4 (V2g \u222a V3g \u222a V4g ) \u2264 \u03b3.\n(6)\nFor d4 (V2g \u222a V3g \u222a V4g ), we only consider those edges that use exactly one vertex from a 4-partite\n\u221a\ngraph Qi , as the number of edges of other types is o(n4 ). Assume that d4 (V2g \u222a V3g \u222a V4g ) \u2265 \u03b3 then\nby Lemma 4 there exist complete 4-partite graphs in H|V2g \u222aV3g \u222aV4g covering at least \u03b3n vertices. We\nremove some of these 4-partite graphs (possibly with splitting and discarding part of it) such that\nfrom no color class we remove more then the number of extra vertices in that color class. Adding\nthese new 4-partite graphs to our cover increases the size of our cover by at least \u03b3 2 n vertices. As\nwe will not need to discard vertices from (V2g \u222a V3g \u222a V4g ) for rebalancing. Instead the extra vertices\nare part of these new 4-partite graphs. In the remaining parts of V2g , V3g and V4g we arbitrarily\ndiscard some extra vertices to restore the balance in the 4-partite graphs.\nSimilarly we will show that either we can increase the size of our cover or we have\n\u0012\n\u0012 \u0013\u0013\nIt\n\u221a\ng\ng\ng\nd4 V2 \u222a V3 \u222a V4 ,\n(7)\n\u2264 \u03b3.\n3\n\u0001\n\u221a\nIndeed assume the contrary, i.e. d4 (V2g \u222aV3g \u222aV4g , I3t ) \u2265 \u03b3, then since both |It | and |V2 \u222aV3g \u222aV4g |\nare at least \u03b3n, by Lemma 4 we can find disjoint complete 4-partite graphs with one color class\nin V2 \u222a V3g \u222a V4g and three in It covering at least \u03b3 2 n/2 vertices. And again as above we can add\nthese 4-partite graphs to our cover and increase the size of our cover as we have extra vertices in\nV2g \u222a V3g \u222a V4g . By the same reasoning we can prove that there are very few edges that uses two\nvertices from V2 \u222a V3g \u222a V4g and two from It .\n27\n\n\fFrom the above observations about the size of Fg and (2) we have that |V2g \u222a V3g \u222a V4g \u222a It | \u2265\n(3/4 \u2212 \u03b1)n. Therefore if we can not increase the size of our cover significantly (by at least \u03b3 2 n/16\nvertices), then by (4), (6) and (7) we get that d4 (V2g \u222a V3g \u222a V4g \u222a It ) < \u03b1. Hence H is \u03b1-extremal.\n\n5\n\nThe Extremal Case\n\nHere our graph H is in the Extremal Case, i.e. there is a B \u2282 V (H) such that\n\u2022 |B| \u2265 ( 43 \u2212 \u03b1)n\n\n\u2022 d4 (B) < \u03b1.\nWe assume that n is sufficiently large and \u03b1 is a sufficiently small constant < 1. Let A = V (H) \\ B,\nby shifting some vertices between A and B we can have that A = n/4 and B = 3n/4 as n \u2208 4Z\n(we still keep the notation A and B). It is easy to see that we still have\nd4 (B) < 6\u03b1\n\n(8)\n\nSince we have\n\n\u0012\n\u0013 \u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013 \u0012 \u0013\nn\u22121\n3n/4\nn\u22121\n|B|\n\u03b41 (H) \u2265\n\u2212\n+1=\n\u2212\n+1\n3\n3\n3\n3\nthis together with (8) implies that almost all 4-sets of V (H) are edges of H except 4-sets of B.\nThus roughly speaking we have that almost every vertex b \u2208 B makes edges with almost all 3-sets\n\u0001\n\u0001\nof vertices in A3 , with almost all 3-sets of vertices in B \\ {b} \u00d7 A2 and with almost all 3-sets\n\u0001\nof vertices in B\\{b}\n\u00d7 A and vice versa. Therefore, we will basically match every vertex in A\n2\n\u0001\nwith a distinct 3-set of vertices in B3 (disjoint from all 3-sets matched with other vertices in A)\nto get the perfect matching. However some vertices may be 'atypical', in the sense that they may\nnot have this connectivity structure hence we will first find a small matching that covers all such\n'atypical' vertices. For the remaining 'typical' vertices we will show that they satisfy the conditions\nof K\u00f6nig-Hall theorem, hence we will match every remaining vertex in A with a distinct 3-sets of\nremaining vertices in B.\nA vertex a \u2208 A is called exceptional if it does not make edges with almost all 3-sets of vertices\nin B, more precisely if\n\u0012 \u0012 \u0013\u0013\n\u0012 \u0013\n\u221a \u0001 |B|\nB\ndeg4 a,\n< 1\u2212 \u03b1\n3\n3\nA vertex a \u2208 A is called strongly exceptional if it makes edges with very few 3-sets in B, more\nprecisely if\n\u0012 \u0012 \u0013\u0013\n\u0012 \u0013\nB\n1/3 |B|\ndeg4 a,\n<\u03b1\n3\n3\n28\n\n\fSimilarly a vertex b \u2208 B is called exceptional if it makes edges with many 3-sets of vertices in B\nmore precisely if\n\u0012 \u0012\n\u0013\u0013\n\u0012 \u0013\n\u221a |B|\nB \\ {b}\n> \u03b1\ndeg4 b,\n3\n3\nA vertex b \u2208 B is called strongly exceptional if it makes edges with almost all 3-sets of vertices in\nB more precisely if\n\u0012 \u0012\n\u0013\u0013\n\u0012 \u0013\nB \\ {b}\n|B|\n1/3\n> (1 \u2212 \u03b1 )\ndeg4 b,\n3\n3\nDenote the set of exceptional and strongly exceptional vertices in A (and B) by XA and SXA\nrespectively (similarly XB and SXB ). Easy calculations using (1) and (8) yields that |XA | \u2264\n\u221a\n\u221a\n18 \u03b1|A| and |XB | \u2264 18 \u03b1|B| and for the strongly exceptional sets we have |SXA | \u2264 40\u03b1|A| and\n|SXB | \u2264 40\u03b1|B|. The constants are not the best possible but we choose them for ease of calculation.\nIf we have both SXB and SXA non empty, (say b \u2208 SXB and a \u2208 SXA ) then since then we\ncan exchange a with b and reduce the size of both SXB and SXA , as it is easy to see that both a\nand b are not strongly exceptional in their new sets. Hence one of the sets SXA and SXB must be\nempty.\n\u0001\nAssume SXB 6= \u2205. By definition of SXB , for every vertex b \u2208 SXB , we have deg3 (b, B3 ) \u2265\n\u0001\n(1 \u2212 \u03b11/3 ) |B|\n3 . This together with the bound on the size of SXB implies that we can greedily\nfind |SXB | vertex disjoint edges in H|B each containing exactly one vertex of SXB . We also select\n|SXB | other vertex disjoint edges such that each edge has two vertices in B \\ XB and the two other\nvertices are in A. We can clearly find such edges because by (1) and definition of XB every vertex\n\u0001\n\u221a\nin B \\XB makes edges with at least (1\u22123 \u03b1)-fraction of 3-sets in B \u00d7 |A|\n2 . We remove the vertices\nof these edges from A and B and denote the remaining set by A0 and B 0 . Let |A0 | + |B 0 | = n0 , by\nthe above procedure we have n0 = n \u2212 8|SXB |, |A0 | = |A| \u2212 2|SXB | and |B 0 | = |B| \u2212 6|SXB | hence\nwe get |B 0 | = 3|A0 | = 3n0 /4.\nIn case SXA 6= \u2205 (and SXB = \u2205), we will first eliminate the vertices in SXA . Note that in this\ncase any vertex b \u2208 B is exchangeable with any vertex in SXA , because if there is a vertex b \u2208 B\n\u0001\n\u0001\nsuch that deg4 (b, B3 ) \u2265 \u03b11/3 |B|\nthen we can replace b with any vertex a \u2208 SXA to reduce the\n3\nsize of SXA (as the vertex b is not strongly exceptional in A and a can not be strongly exceptional\nin the set B). Therefore we consider the whole set SXA \u222a B. By (1) for any vertex v \u2208 SXA \u222a B\n\n29\n\n\fwe have\n\u0012 \u0012\n\u0013\u0013\n\u0012 \u0013 \u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\nSXA \u222a B\n|B|\n(|SXA | \u2212 1)\n(|SXA | \u2212 1)\n\u2265(|SXA | \u2212 1)\n+\n|B| +\n+1\ndeg4 v,\n3\n2\n2\n3\n\u0012\n\u0013\n4(|SXA | \u2212 1)\n\u2265\n+1\n3\nwhere the last inequality holds when n is large enough and |SXA is small. So with a simple greedy\nprocedure we find |SXA | disjoint edges in H|SXA \u222aB and remove these edges from H. Note that\nthis is the only place where we critically use the minimum degree. We let A0 = A \\ SXA and B 0\nhas all other remaining vertices. Again as above we have n0 = n \u2212 4|SXA |, |A0 | = |A| \u2212 |SXA | and\n|B 0 | = |B| \u2212 3|SXA | hence we get |B 0 | = 2|A0 | = 3n0 /4.\nHaving dealt with the strongly exceptional vertices, the vertices of XA and XB in A0 and B 0\ncan be eliminated using the fact that their sizes are much smaller than the crossing degrees of\n\u221a\nvertices in those sets. For instance as observed above we have |XA | \u2264 18 \u03b1|A| while for any vertex\n0\u0001\n0 \u0001\na \u2208 XA , we have that deg4 (a, B2 ) \u2265 \u03b11/3 |B3 | /2 (because a \u2208\n/ SXA ). Therefore by a simple\ngreedy procedure for each a \u2208 XA we delete a disjoint edge that contains a and three vertices from\nB 0 . Similarly for each b \u2208 XB we delete an edge that contains b and uses one vertex from A0 and\nthe other two vertices from B 0 distinct from b. Clearly we can find such disjoint edges, hence we\nremoved a partial matching that covers all vertices in the strongly exceptional and exceptional sets.\nFinally in the leftover sets of A0 and B 0 (denote them by A00 and B 00 , by construction we still\nhave |B 00 | = 3|A00 |) we will find |A00 | disjoint edges each using one vertex in A00 and three vertices\n00 \u0001\n00 \u0001\nin B 00 . Note that for every vertex a \u2208 A00 we have deg4 (a, B3 ) \u2265 (1 \u2212 2\u03b11/3 ) |B3 | (as a \u2208\n/ XA ).\n00\nWe say that a vertex bi and a pair bj , bk in B are good for each other if (bi , bj , bk , al ) \u2208 E(H)\nfor at least (1 \u2212 40\u03b11/4 )|A00 | vertices al in A00 . We have that any vertex bi \u2208 B 00 is good for at\n00 \u0001\n/ XB ). We call such a\nleast (1 \u2212 40\u03b11/4 ) |B2 | pairs of vertices in B 00 (again this is so because bi \u2208\n(bi , bj , bj ) a good triplet.\nWe randomly select a set T1 of 100\u03b11/4 |B 00 | vertex disjoint 3-sets of vertices in B 00 . By the above\nobservation with high probability every vertex a \u2208 A00 make edges in H with at least 3|T1 |/4 triplets\nin T1 and every triplet in T1 makes an edge with at least 3|A00 |/4 vertices in A00 . In B 00 \\ V (T1 ) still\nevery vertex is good for almost all pairs (as the size of T1 is very small).\nWe cover vertices in B 00 \\ V (T1 ) with disjoint good triplets (i.e. the triplet makes an edge in\nH with at least (1 \u2212 40\u03b11/4 )|A00 | vertices in A00 . This can be done by considering a 3-graph with\nvertex set B 00 \\ V (T1 ) and all the good triplets as its edges. As argued above every vertex is good for\nalmost all pairs. We can find a perfect matching in this 3-graph (see [13]). Let the set of triplets\nin this perfect matching be T2 .\n30\n\n\fNow construct an auxiliary bipartite graph G(L, R), such that L = A00 and vertices in R\ncorresponds to the triplets in T1 and T2 . A vertex in al \u2208 L is connected to a vertex y \u2208 R if\nthe triplet corresponding to y (say bi , bj , bk ) is such that (bi , bj , bk , al ) \u2208 E(H). We will show that\nG(L, R) satisfies the K\u00f6nig-Hall criteria. Considering the sizes of A00 and T1 it is easy to see that\nfor every subset Q \u2282 R if |Q| \u2264 (1 \u2212 40\u03b11/4 )|A00 | then |N (Q)| \u2265 |Q|. When |Q| > (1 \u2212 40\u03b11/4 )|A00 |\n(using |B 00 | = 2|A00 |) any such Q must have at least 6|T1 |/10 vertices corresponding to pairs in\nT1 , hence with high probability N (Q) = L \u2265 |Q|. Therefore there is a perfect matching of R\ninto L. This perfect matching in G(L, R) readily gives us a matching in H covering all vertices in\nA00 and B 00 , which together with the edges we already removed (covering strongly exceptional and\nexceptional vertices) is a perfect matching in H.\n\u0003\nAcknowledgement.
