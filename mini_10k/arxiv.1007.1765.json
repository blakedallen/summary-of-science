INTRODUCTION\nInterferometric measurements of path length differences of stars over large baselines can deliver extremely accurate astrometric data, which is one of the motivations to build an astronomical interferometer. The interferometer\nGRAVITY will be capable of detecting two objects simultaneously in the field of view of the VLTI. Both objects\nare separated at the VLTI interferometric laboratory within the instrument and detected in separate beam combiners. To perform the astrometric measurement with high accuracy, the differential path length through the\nVLTI and the instrument has to be known (and tracked since Earth's rotation will permanently change it) at\nan even higher level of accuracy. This is the scope of a dedicated system, commonly called metrology. The error\nSend correspondence to H. Bartko (E-mail: hbartko@mpe.mpg.de)\n\n\fbudget of the whole instrument leaves an RMS dOPD (differential optical path difference) error of 1 nm within\na total of 3 min integration time for the metrology (see Gillessen et al.1 2010). The difference in path length\noccurs primarily within the instrument after the field separation. But a difference in path length can also occur\nwithin the VLTI, since the traveled path depends on the exact footprint of the beam through the VLTI optics.\nSpecial points where large systematic differences can occur are at the field locations, where optical elements are\npresent. The variable curvature mirror (VCM) with \u223c150 nm surface variation due to adaption of the surface\nshape is among the candidates to introduce large field dependent path length changes in a systematic way. Thus\nan active measurement of the path length within the instrument and the VLTI is required. The PRIMA facility\nuses a heterodyne difference frequency technique with lasers launched at the center of the pupil at the beam\ncombiner and being back reflected from a retro reflector behind the MACAO dichroic mirror (Leveque et al.2\n2003). The quantity measured is the optical path length difference for each object between the two telescopes\nfrom the beam combiner to the dichroic mirror. On the one hand, the difference frequency technique is known\nto be extremely accurate and laser intensity independent. On the other hand, the center of pupil measurement\ndoes not trace the path of the science light, since soon after leaving the pupil plane the two beams begin to travel\nalong different paths and measuring the center of the beams will not represent the complete truth. In particular,\nin a focal plane the small laser beam will form a larger PSF than the science light does. The preliminary design\nof the GRAVITY metrology follows an implementation which (Rabien et al.3 2008):\n\u2022 maps the full pupil with the metrology beams\n\u2022 covers the total length of the instrument and the VLTI up to the entrance pupil of the system, the secondary\nmirror of the VLT telescopes\n\u2022 allows a measurement for all beams in parallel\n\u2022 requires only minor retro fittings of the VLTI or VLTs.\nThe basic idea is to split a laser beam into two equally bright beams with a fixed phase relation and inject\nthem backwards into the two beam combiners. From both beam combiners four beams will then travel the exact\nsame path backwards through the instrument and VLTI as the science light is traveling forward. At the VLT\nsecondary, the entrance pupil of the system, the laser beams from the two beam combiners will interfere and\nform a fringe pattern. This fringe pattern will be detected with an off-axis infrared camera in the scattered light\nfrom the UTs secondary mirror plus dedicated scattering screens attached to the telescope spider holding the\nsecondary mirror. The interferogram can finally be used to determine the differential path up to this point. This\nconcept is illustrated in Figure 1.\n\n2. PHYSICAL REQUIREMENTS ON GRAVITY METROLOGY\n2.1 Accuracy of Phase Measurements\nThe required accuracy for the metrology measurement is driven by three factors:\n\u2022 The measurements of the stellar phase differences should be the main contributors to the astrometric error\nbudget; the metrology error should only contribute marginally: 1 nm dOPD error in 3 minutes\n\u2022 The metrology signal shall allow the differential delay lines (DDL) loop to be stably closed: maximum\nphase error per ABCD 0.13 rad, see section 7.2.\n\u2022 The metrology needs to be fast enough to drive the phase at a reasonable speed during the acquisition\nprocedure.\n\n\fdOPD\n\nOPD\nPupil T2\n\nPupil\nfringe\ndetector T1\n\nPupil T1\n\nPupil\nfringe\ndetector T2\n\nOPD/2\n\nMetrology\nCalibration\nSensor\nDiode 1\n\nField\nsplitter\n\nDDL B1\n\nDDL A2\n\nField\nsplitter\n\nInstrument\nPupil\n\nBC A\n\nBC B\n\nDDL B2\n\nMetrology\nCalibration\nSensor\nDiode 2\n\nVCM\n\nDelay line 1\n\nVCM\n\nDDL A1\n\nDelay line 2\n\nUA\nUB\nDetector B\n\nPhase\nshifter\n\nDetector A\n\nMetrology\nlaser\nFigure 1. Principle of the GRAVITY metrology system shown for two telescopes. A laser beam travels the same path\nbackwards through all the beam combination and the VLTI optical train. Detection of the resulting fringe pattern takes\nplace by imaging the VLT secondary mirror plus dedicated scattering screens on the telescope spider with an off-axis\ninfrared camera.\n\n2.2 Metrology Fringe Detection in M1 Space\nAs shown by Lacour et al.4 (2010), the narrow angle baseline for the astrometric mode of GRAVITY is defined\nby the vector between the two points (projected to M1 space if not defined therein) on each telescope where the\n\n\fmetrology phase measurement is made. This requires a metrology fringe detection after reflection on M1 at a\nfixed position with respect to M1.\nFor both UTs and ATs we will sample the metrology interference pattern after reflection on M1 with dedicated\nscattering screens / photo diodes, which have fixed positions with respect to M1 on the M2/M3 spider arms.\nWe use their signals to compute the metrology phase in real-time. All individual phase measurements will be\nweighted and averaged to obtain a single phase measurement per telescope.\nIn our current baseline design, as presented in this document, we plan to record full images of the fringe\npattern on M2 with IR cameras in scattered light for the UTs. This data will enable us to correct off-line for\npossible higher order aberrations (Rabien et al.3 2008). In August 2010 we will conduct a Metrology test at the\nESO Paranal observatory to measure the amount of quasi-static differential abberations, and their stability. In\ncase of sufficiently small and stable abberations, it may be sufficient to only sample the metrology fringe pattern\nwith diodes also in the case of the UTs.\n\n3. METROLOGY SYSTEM DESIGN\n3.1 Basis Description of Working Principle\nFigure 1 shows a schematic drawing of the optical path within the VLTI and the GRAVITY instrument. The\nlight from two astronomical objects enters the system at the telescope pupils, e.g. the VLT secondary mirrors.\nThe brighter of the two objects (A) is marked in red, the other one (B) in green. The optical path length\ndifference to the beam combination has to be compensated for with the VLTI main delay lines. Within the\ninstrument the light from the two objects is separated at the field splitter and sent through differential delay\nlines (DDLs) to the beam combination (BC A and BC B), after which the light is fed into the spectrometers. A\nlaser source operating at 1908 nm near the atmospheric K band is split into two beams and sent backwards into\nthe beam combiners. Starting at the beam combiner, the laser light travels exactly the same path backwards\nthrough the VLTI, as the light from objects A and B travels forward. At each pupil the laser wavefronts overlap,\ntilted by an angle with respect to each other that corresponds to the angular separation of the astronomical\nobjects A and B, and create interference fringes. The maximum number of fringes for a 2\" UT field of view\n(FOV) and a metrology wavelength of 1908 nm is 40.5 fringes. These fringes can be detected in scattered light\nfrom the secondary mirror, as well as from dedicated scattering screens mounted on the telescope spider, with\nan off-axis infrared camera, or directly using infrared sensitive photodiodes. The following analysis of the optical\npath length differences along the science and the metrology beams shows that the proposed setup is able to\ndeliver the desired differential dOPD from the measurements on sky and from the fringe pattern detected on the\ntelescopes. The individual optical path lengths through the system are denoted as:\nLA1\nLA2\nLB1\nLB2\nDLxx\nUA , UB\n\nred path from the telescope T1 to the DDLA1\nred path from the telescope T2 to the DDLA2\ngreen path from the telescope T1 to the DDLB1\ngreen path from the telescope T2 to the DDLB2\npath length from the differential delay line entrance up to the beam combination\npath lengths from the metrology laser splitter to the beam combiners.\n\nThe following four quantities \u03a8A , \u03a8B , \u03a6A and \u03a6B are measured: \u03a8A is the phase difference of the light of\nstar A with an effective wavelength \u03bbA measured at detector A (for the definition and measurement of effective\nwavelength see Choquet et al.5 2010):\n\u03a8A = {(LA1 + DLA1 ) \u2212 (LA2 + DLA2 + OP D)}\n\n2\u03c0\n.\n\u03bbA\n\n(1)\n\n\u03a8B is the corresponding phase difference of the light of star B measured at detector B. Since the phases of the\nstars' light will be measured for multiple wavelengths, an absolute length difference can be detected, e.g. the\ncenter of the white light fringe can be determined at the point where \u03a8A = 0 for all \u03bbi (see Choquet et al.5\n\n\f2010). In contrast to that, the phase difference for the single metrology laser wavelength is only unambiguous\nwithin the interval \u2212\u03c0 < \u03a6 < \u03c0. At the laser fringe detector at telescope number 1 the phase difference of the\nlaser beams for the laser wavelength \u03bbL is:\n\u03a61 = {(LA1 + DLA1 + UA ) \u2212 (LB1 + DLB1 + UB )}\n\n2\u03c0\n2\u03c0\n+ n1 2\u03c0 = {(LA1 + DLA1 ) \u2212 (LB1 + DLB1 )}\n+ \u22061 ,\n\u03bbL\n\u03bbL\n(2)\n\nsimilar at the laser fringe detector number 2:\n2\u03c0\n2\u03c0\n+ n2 2\u03c0 = {(LA2 + DLA2 ) \u2212 (LB2 + DLB2 )}\n+ \u22062 .\n\u03bbL\n\u03bbL\n(3)\nThe constants \u22061 and \u22062 can be determined with the metrology zero point calibration procedure, see section\n6.2. In the astrometric mode of GRAVITY the quantity that has to be measured is dOPD on sky:\n\u03a62 = {(LA2 + DLA2 + UA ) \u2212 (LB2 + DLB2 + UB )}\n\ndOPD = \u03a8A\n\n\u03bbB\n\u03bbL\n\u03bbL\n\u03bbA\n\u2212 \u03a8B\n+ (\u03a62 \u2212 \u03a61 )\n\u2212 (\u22062 \u2212 \u22061 )\n.\n2\u03c0\n2\u03c0\n2\u03c0\n2\u03c0\n\n(4)\n\nThis equation contains only the measurable quantities and the calibration phases. It shows that the quantity\ndOPD can be retrieved from the beam combiners and the metrology signals. Each of the values above contributes\nto the final error budget.\n\n3.2 Phase Shifting Interferometer\nThe laser wavefronts that are launched from the fiber exits will overlap in the pupil plane of the telescopes.\nFrom the resulting intensity distribution the global phase offset has to be extracted. The intensity distribution\nis detected with a camera which images the scattered light from the secondary mirror and dedicated scattering\nscreens installed on the telescope spiders. The phase extraction from these images has to solve for the following\nproperties:\n\u2022 Most likely the intensity distribution, even if being emitted perfectly Gaussian from the fibers, will not be\nsmooth and Gaussian any more after having passed all the VLTI beam train.\n\u2022 The scattering process from the solid surface and dust particles will result in a speckle pattern on the\ncamera, due to the coherence of the light and the surface inhomogeneities.\n\u2022 The intensity of the scattered light at the secondary mirrors will be low, since it is a high quality mirror.\n\u2022 There will be background radiation, since the ambient temperature is 280K.\n\u2022 The intensity pattern will rotate with the field rotation on sky.\n\u2022 During the calibration process the number of fringes in the pupil plane will vary between 0 and 40 for a\nmaximum separation of the objects of 2\" (UTs).\n\u2022 The phase computation must be sufficiently fast to steer the differential delay lines (see section 6.2).\nTo meet these requirements the proposed method for the phase extraction follows a routine based on phase\nshifting interferometry. Widely used for the measurement of optical surfaces, phase shifting interferometry (PSI)\nallows a phase difference to be measured with high accuracy. Standard laboratory interferometers make use of\nthe comparison between a reference phase and a phase under test, e.g. in a Twyman-Green setup. The reference\nbeam is phase shifted in several steps, and an interferogram is recorded at each step. Due to the coherence of\nthe laser wavefronts, the intensity at each position (x, y) follows the equation of a two-beam interference:\nI(x, y, \u03b1) = I \u2032 (x, y) + I \u2032\u2032 (x, y) cos(\u03a6(x, y) + \u03b1) .\n\n(5)\n\nHere, \u03b1 is the global additional phase difference, which is deterministically added to the launched beam. There\nare several standard algorithms to calculate the local phase from a set of phase shifted interferograms, which can\n\n\fbe found in textbooks (e.g. Malacara6 1992). With the four-step algorithm four interferograms are recorded with\nphaseshifts of \u03b1i = 0, \u03c0/2, \u03c0, 3\u03c0/2 respectively. The solution to the four equations contains only the measured\nintensities:\nI4 \u2212 I2\ntan(\u03a6(x, y)) =\n.\n(6)\nI1 \u2212 I3\nComparable solutions can be found for three or more steps, e.g. the Hariharan or Carr\u00e9 algorithm. Since we are\nonly interested in a global phase difference from the calibration point to the observation location in the field, an\nabsolute phase measurement is not needed, and the observed 2\u03c0 jumps can be recorded in a counter. The ABCD\nalgorithm allows a relatively simple and straight forward calibration of the phase shifter to the values even for\na non-linear phase shift response of the phase shifter to the control voltage, see section 6.1.2.\n\n4. HARDWARE\nIn this section we will describe the preliminary design and layout of the hardware of the GRAVITY metrology.\nThe analysis of the performance of the full GRAVITY metrology system based on the hardware requirements\nwill be presented in section 7.\n\n4.1 Hardware Overview\nFigure 2 shows a sketch of the metrology hardware: The hardware of the metrology system located in or near\nthe VLTI laboratory includes the metrology laser source, the beam transmission fiber, the splitting and phase\nshifting unit and the metrology fiber positioner for the coupling adjustment of the IR laser light into the IO\nvia the spectrometer optics. The laser itself with the frequency control unit will be located in the GRAVITY\nelectronics racks in the Combined Coud\u00e9 lab. The laser foreseen will be a commercial high power single frequency\nlaser. The delivery of the laser light to the GRAVITY beam combiner instrument will be done with a single\nmode polarization maintaining fiber. Since the phase of the laser in front of the cryostat is unimportant, the\nfiber delivery needs no special protection. The fiber is connected to the inside of the cryostat by a commercially\navailable single mode and polarization maintaining fiber feed-through.\nIn the cryostat the laser will be split into four beams with equal intensity. Two of the arms are directed to\nelectro-optical phase shifters. After the phase shifting the four fibers are routed to the metrology fiber positioners,\nwhich align the fibers in the field before the fiber coupling optics of the spectrometer (Araujo-Hauck et al.7 2010,\nStraubmeier et al.8 2010). The alignment is motorized in three axes for each fiber to allow a remote coupling\nefficiency optimization, while the cryostat is closed. After the light leaves the fibers, it is collimated at the laser\ncollimator in the spectrometer and joins the science light at a dichroic beam splitter and is injected into the\nwaveguide of the integrated optics (IO, Jocou et al.9 2010).\nThe metrology light passes the integrated optics backwards, in the opposite direction of the starlight. Inside\nthe IO the metrology light is split such that all four entrance fibers of the IO contain equal amounts of metrology\nlight. The metrology light travels trough the fiber control units containing the differential delay lines (DDLs) and\npolarization rotators (see Perrin et al.10 2010) to the field splitter of the GRAVITY fiber coupler (see figure 4).\nIn the field splitter the metrology light from the beam combiners A and B is Combined and via the VLTI optical\ntrain guided to the four telescopes. As the laser light from the two beam combiners A and B is coherent, there\nis a characteristic interference pattern in each instrument pupil. The number of fringes visible in the instrument\npupil depends on the angular separation of the fibers in the fiber coupler projected on the sky. The 2\" maximum\nfield of view of the VLTI (UTs) corresponds to 40 interference fringes.\nFor the GRAVITY metrology two instrument pupils are of special importance: first, the pupil in the\nGRAVITY fiber coupler (Pfuhl et al.11 2010). The interference pattern in this pupil is sampled by the metrology\ncalibration sensor diode and allows an accurate calibration and monitoring of the active components like the\nmetrology laser, phase shifter and fiber controllers. Second, there is also the characteristic interference pattern\nof the metrology laser light visible at the entrance pupil of the telescopes, M2. In case of the UTs the full M2\npupil will be imaged in scattered light, plus dedicated scattering screens on the M2 spider. In case of the ATs\nthe pupil will be sampled with photodiodes mounted on the M3 spider.\nIn the following we will detail the hardware items and specify their performance requirements.\n\n\fFigure 2. Sketch of the metrology hardware. The metrology laser system is located in the electronics racks of the Combined\nCoud\u00e9 laboratory. The metrology laser light is sent via a single mode polarization maintaining fiber to the GRAVITY\ncryostat. In the cryostat a splitting and phase shifting unit is located. The laser is first split in two steps into four fibers\ncontaining equal amounts of light. Two of the fibers pass an electro-optical phase shifter before they are directed to the\nmetrology fiber positioners. The two other fibers are directly routed to the fiber positioner. The fibers end at the interface\nbetween the metrology fiber positioner and the cryostat. The metrology light enters the laser collimation optics of the\nspectrometer as a free beam. It is directed towards the IO beam combiner and overlayed onto the stellar light with a\ndichroic beam splitter. Finally, the metrology laser light is fed into two of the 24 exits of the integrated optics. In the IO\nthe laser light is split again and distributed to the four entrance fibers of the IO beam combiners. The interference pattern\nin the pupil of the Fiber Coupler is sampled by the metrology calibration sensor diode and allows an accurate calibration\nand monitoring of the active components like the metrology laser, phase shifter and fiber controllers. A characteristic\ninterference pattern of the metrology laser light will be visible at the entrance pupil of the telescopes, M2. In case of the\nUTs the full M2 pupil will be imaged in scattered light, plus dedicated scattering screens on the M2 spider. In case of\nthe ATs the pupil will be sampled with photodiodes mounted on the M3 spider.\n\n4.2 IR Laser System\nThe metrology laser system shall produce high power single frequency laser light coupled inside a single mode\npolarization maintaining fiber. The stability of the laser frequency as well as the laser power is of special concern.\nThe proposed laser system shall fulfill the following requirements:\n\n\f\u2022 power output: > 2W continuous wave\n\u2022 single frequency laser with output wavelength: (1908 \u00b1 1) nm, stabilized to \u00b130 MHz absolute wavelength\naccuracy\n\u2022 linear polarized\n\u2022 power output fluctuations: < 0.5% RMS of the integrated laser power over a 33 ms timescale.\n\n4.3 Passive Fiber Optic Components\nThe polarization maintaining fibers transport the laser light from the laser source to the metrology fiber positioner\nunits. The fiber path from the metrology laser splitter to the beam combiner, UA/B is of special importance. It\nis a so-called non-common path, where the laser light does not follow the star light. The path length difference\n\u22062 \u2212 \u22061 (see equation 4 and section 4) can be calibrated, see equation 10 and section 6.2, but needs to be stable\nat a level below 0.5 nm during the observation (see section 7.4). The optical path length of an optical fiber\nchanges (\u2206L) as a function of temperature change (\u2206T ):\n\u2206L = (n\u03b1 + dn/dT )l\u2206T ,\n\n(7)\n\nwhere \u03b1 denotes the linear thermal expansion coefficient, n the index of refraction and l is the fiber length.\nStandard fused silica fibers show an optical path length change of: \u2206L = 1nm(\u2206T /10mK)(l/1cm) (Leviton &\nFrey12 2006). Air-guiding photonic-bandgap fibers offer much smaller path length differences (Dangui et al.13\n2005).\n\n4.4 Phase Shifter\nThe two phase shifters provide the phase shifts of \u03b1i = 0, \u03c0/2, \u03c0, 3\u03c0/2 necessary for the ABCD phase shifting\ninterferometer algorithm. For this a very accurate reproducibility of the phase shifts is of utmost importance.\nThe phase shifters are commercially available as integrated optics components employing LiNbO3 crystals. By\napplying an appropriate voltage to the birefringent crystal a corresponding change in the extraordinary refractive\nindex will occur. If the optical input is both linearly polarized and aligned with the extraordinary axis of the\nmodulator crystal, the output will undergo a pure phase shift with no change in the state of polarization. The\nphase shifters shall fulfill the following requirements:\n\u2022 transmission > 70%, full-wave amplitude modulation < 0.5%\n\u2022 phase shifting repeatability < \u03bb/5000\n\u2022 operation laser power: 0.5 W, damage threshold > 1 W\n\u2022 min. 13 effective bits, absolute voltage repeatability < 1/5000.\n\n4.5 Metrology Calibration Sensor Diode\nThe metrology Calibration Sensor Diode samples the light flux in the center of the 18 mm diameter pupil in the\nFiber Coupler subsystem (see figure 4). This allows to (see also section 6.1):\n\u2022 adjust/monitor the metrology fiber positioner\n\u2022 monitor the laser power\n\u2022 in-situ calibrate the phase shifter\n\u2022 calibrate the DDL, monitor the DDL position.\nRequirements:\n\u2022 pick-up fiber with core diameter: 100...110 \u03bcm, total transmission T> 90%\n\u2022 combined diode and amplifier responsivity: 8*10\u22129 W shall be converted to 10 V, bandwidth (3dB) 1000 Hz,\ninput current equivalent noise: < 3 * 10\u221212 A / Hz1/2 , maximum non-linearity for 10 V output of < 0.1%\n\u2022 ADC sampling rate \u2265 1kS/s, min. 12 effective bits, absolute precision < 1/1000.\n\n\f4.6 Metrology Light Detection at UTs\nThe UT IR receivers consist of an IR camera and optics each. Here, we describe the design parameters of both\ncomponents. The detection will be two-fold: The first order signal will come from scatterers mounted onto the\nM2-spider (section 4.6.2), the higher order corrections can be derived from the image of M2. Both signals will\nbe measured with the same cameras.\n4.6.1 IR Cameras\nFrom the physical requirements, we derive the following requirements for the IR cameras:\n\u2022 The image of M2 needs to be mapped onto at least 160 \u00d7 160 pixels (4 pixels per fringe, 40 fringes).\n\u2022 It shall be possible to observe the inner parts of the spider arms as well.\n\u2022 The read noise should be below 250 electrons.\n\u2022 A quantum efficiency of at least 30% at 1.9\u03bcm.\n\u2022 The frame rate shall be adjustable from 10 Hz to 200 Hz.\n\u2022 The dynamic range must be sufficient to allow for exposures of 40ms at least at the given thermal background.\n4.6.2 Scattering Screens on Telescope Spider\nThe IR cameras will also be used to image the (inner parts of the) spider arms on which M2 is mounted. Optically,\nthese arms are in the M1 space. The metrology light gets reflected via M2 and M1 into the direction of the two\ncelestial objects that are being observed with GRAVITY. This light also shines on the spider arms from below.\nHence, having a fix reference point on the spider arms at which the ABCD algorithm can be observed with the\ncameras is a suitable realization of the requirement that the metrology signal shall be measured in M1 space\n(Lacour et al.4 2010). The fixed reference points can be optimized to be good scatterers to ease detection of the\nsignal. The scattering screens on the telescope spider shall fulfill the following requirements:\n\u2022 Size: smaller than 1/4 of a fringe. Given the diameter of M1 (8m), the maximum number of fringes (40),\nthis means the scatterers shall not exceed 5 cm in diameter.\n\u2022 The scatterers shall be completely passive devices with a high scattering strength (the albedo shall be\nlarger than 80%).\n\u2022 The scatterers shall be suitable for detection with an external metrology, i.e. they should carry clearly\nvisible optical targets.\nOur current baseline design consists of 4 little metal cubes with dimensions of 20 \u00d7 20 mm. The surface pointing\ndownwards has a matte white color; the four surfaces pointing to the sides contain optical targets. The scatterers\nwill be screwed onto the spider arms in a position that is\n\u2022 close enough to M2, such that it is inside the field of view of the cameras\n\u2022 not too close to M2, such that no excess metrology light from the beam going from M3 to M2 and shining\nbeyond M2 perturbs the signal of the metrology light traveling via M1.\n\u2022 not too close to M2, such that none of the 4 scatterers will be shadowed by the M2 body, i.e. all are visible\nfrom the IR cameras.\n\n\f4.7 Metrology Light Detection at ATs\nThe metrology fringes at the ATs will be sampled by four IR sensitive photo diodes mounted on the four spider\narms which hold the M3 mirror. In order to increase the effective area of the diodes without increasing their\nnoise, the metrology light is focused by a lens of 10 mm diameter onto the diode. A pre-amplifier will be placed\nright next to the diode and the amplified and low-pass filtered analog signal will be transported to the Nasmyth\nelectronics box. There the four analog signals of the four diodes will be sent via a digital fiber link using the\npre-installed single mode fibers to all AT stations to the central Combined Coud\u00e9 lab and converted back to an\nanalog signal. In the Combined Coud\u00e9 lab the 16 analog signals from the four diodes at the four ATs will be\ndirectly digitized by the metrology real-time computer (see section 5).\nThe metrology fringes detection and read-out on the ATs consists of the following components:\n\u2022 4 photodiodes on M3 spider + pre-amplifier (max 1 W power consumption) per AT\n\u2022 analog optical link between AT stations and Combined Coud\u00e9 lab\n\u2022 ADC.\nThe IR sensitive diodes, amplifiers and the ADCs shall fulfill the same requirements as the respective components of the metrology calibration sensor diodes, see section 4.5.\n\n5. COMPUTING / SLOW CONTROL\n\nFigure 3. Left: Metrology computing block diagram for the case of ATs. The RTC.MET and ICS.RTC computers are\nlocated in the Combined Coud\u00e9 lab and the IR diodes are located on the M3 spiders of the ATs. The calibration sensors,\nDDLs and phase shifters will be located inside the GRAVITY cryostat in the VLTI lab. Right: Metrology computing\nblock diagram for the case of UTs. The LLCU, RTC.MET and ICS.RTC computers are located in the Combined Coud\u00e9\nlab and the IR cameras are located on the UTs. The calibration sensors, DDLs and phase shifters will be located inside\nthe GRAVITY cryostat in the VLTI lab.\n\nThe metrology system employs the phase shifting interferometer ABCD algorithm (see section 3.2) to measure\nthe path difference between one telescope and the two beam combiners. This requires an accurate timing between\nthe phase shifter, the metrology calibration sensor diode and the metrology fringe detectors at the UTs and ATs.\nThe 30 Hz phase shifting is steered by the metrology real-time local control unit (RTC.MET LCU). This computer\nis synchronized via the ESO reflective memory network (RMN, see Wallander, A.14 2006) with the instrument\ncontrol system real-time control unit (ICS.RTC LCU), which steers the eight DDLs and the two metrology phase\nshifters. In the final design phase, we will evaluate whether the DDLs and phase shifters may also be steered\nby the RTC.MET LCU reducing the complexity of the system. The analog signals of the metrology calibration\nsensors and the IR sensitive diodes of the ATs are recorded directly in the RTC.MET LCU. The IR cameras\n\n\fof the UTs are controlled by a dedicated real time Linux based local control unit (LLCU), which is connected\nto the RTC.MET via the RMN. Figure 3 (left) shows the layout of the Metrology Control Loop for the case of\nATs. Figure 3 (right) shows the layout of the Metrology Control Loop for the case of UTs. The raw images of\nthe metrology cameras are sent directly from the LLCU (including appropriate time stamp) to the instrument\nworkstation for data storage.\n\n5.1 Data Inputs / Outputs\nTable 1 shows the science data inputs, their rate and number of bits. All of these data have to be stored including\nan accurate time stamp for offline analysis. The data rate is dominated by the pictures of the IR cameras of the\nUTs. There are only two real-time data outputs to steer the phase shifters, 14 bits each at a rate of 30Hz.\nName\nrate / Hz # bits\nlaser power\n1\n12\nlaser wavelength\n1\n12\nlaser status\n1\n8\n4\u00d7 metrology calibration sensor (12 bits each)\n1000\n48\n4\u00d7 UT IR cameras (256 \u00d7 256 pixels, 14 bit)\n30\n4E+06\n4\u00d74 AT IR diodes (12 bits each)\n1000\n3072\nTable 1. Science data inputs, their rate and number of bits.\n\n5.2 Real-Time Computation Tasks\nThe following real-time computation tasks are necessary for the GRAVITY metrology system:\n\u2022 on the LLCU:\n\u2013 IR camera Image Acquisition Process software\n\u2013 Metrology Phase Analyzer software\n\u2022 on the RTC.MET:\n\u2013 DDL Signal Processor software\n\u2013 metrology calibration sensor read-out software\n\u2013 AT fringe sampling diodes read-out software\n\u2022 on the ICS.RTC:\n\u2013 DDL Controller software\n\u2013 metrology phase shifter controller software.\n\n5.3 Data Storage\nWe plan to store the full metrology raw data in order to be able to do a detailed offline analysis. The amount\nof data to be stored is dominated by the image size of the metrology cameras. To reduce the data stream to\nbe archived, 40 successive metrology camera raw frames will always be integrated (co-added) into four frames\ncorresponding to the phase shifter settings A, B, C, and D, which will then be stored, resulting in a data stream\nof 480 kB/s.\n\n6. CALIBRATION STRATEGY AND PERFORMANCE\nHere we shortly present the calibration strategy and performance of the GRAVITY metrology and its subcomponents.\n\n\fFigure 4. Metrology optical path from the IR laser to the Metrology Calibration Sensor Diode, which samples the\ninterference pattern of the metrology laser light tracing the path of the two stars A and B behind the dichroic in the\nGRAVITY fiber coupler.\n\n6.1 Metrology Calibration Sensor Diode\nThe light intensity at the metrology calibration sensor diode 1 mounted in the pupil center is (see figure 4):\n\u03a61 = {(DLB1 + UB ) \u2212 (DLA1 + UA )}\n\n2\u03c0\n+ \u03b1(V ) ,\n\u03bbL\n\n(8)\n\nwhere \u03b1(V ) denotes the phase shift of the phase shifter device according to the control voltage V. Therefore, the\nmetrology calibration sensor allows to:\n\u2022 monitor the metrology IR laser power\n\u2022 adjust/monitor the metrology fiber positioner\n\u2022 in-situ calibrate the phase shifter\n\u2022 calibrate the DDL, monitor the DDL position.\nFor a fixed position of the metrology fiber positioners as well as phase shifter and DDL settings the observed\nintensity with the metrology calibration sensor diode is proportional to the power of the metrology laser.\n6.1.1 Performance of Metrology Calibration Sensor Diode\nAccording to the metrology transmission budget (see table 2), we expect an intensity of 18 mW in the pupil of\nthe fiber coupler. The center of the 18 mm diameter pupil will be sampled with a fiber of 100 \u03bcm core diameter.\nThe fiber diameter corresponds to 1/4 of the fringe spacing of max. 40 fringes over the pupil (18mm/40/4 =\n112 \u03bcm). The light power in the fiber is thus (including a transmission of the dichroic of 1%): Ifiber = 5.6*10\u22129 W.\nAccounting for possible losses in the multimode fiber and the coupling between fiber and metrology calibration\nsensor photodiode, we expect a light flux on the diode of IA + IB = 5 * 10\u22129 W. The average intensity over one\nABCD phase shift cycle is then hIA + IB i = 2.5 * 10\u22129 W. According to the specifications (see section 4.5) the\nerror of the intensity measurement is dominated by the noise of the amplifier of < 3 * 10\u221212 A/Hz1/2 . Together\nwith a response of the diode of 1 A/W this results in a noise equivalent power per 33 ms exposure (phase shifter\ntime step) of NEP= 1.7 * 10\u221211 W. According to equation 11 the phase error \u2206\u03c6 per 33 ms exposure (calculated\nfrom the last 4 ABCD measurements) is \u2206\u03c6 = 4.3 * 10\u22123 = 1.5 nm \u03bb2\u03c0L .\n\n\f6.1.2 Phase Shifter Calibration\nUsing the GRAVITY metrology as a phase shifting interferometer (see section 5.2) relies on the phase shifts\n\u03b1i = 0, \u03c0/2, \u03c0, 3\u03c0/2 being exactly known. Errors in \u03b1i will result in a systematic error of the calculated phases.\nThe systematic phase offset will be of the same order of magnitude as the error on \u03b1i . Since we want to measure\nthe phase with the metrology system to 1 nm\u223c \u03bb/2000, the individual phase shifts have to be known to at least\nthe same level of accuracy or better. The calibration routine for the phase shifter developed for this purpose\nmakes use of similar identities as shown by Rabien et al.15 (2006), see also Rabien et al.3 (2008).\nThe method described there requires a linear response of the metrology calibration sensor diode (see section\n4.5). The phase shifter response function does not need to be linear. Moreover, the interferometer needs to be\nstable during one set of phase shift measurements, e.g. that the internal dOPD does not drift within a \u03bb/2000\nmargin. Since it is possible to measure such datasets fast, this is not considered to be problematic. For phase\nshifts of \u03b12 \u2212 \u03b11 \u223c 90\u25e6 the error of the phase shift is given by:\n\u2206(\u03b12 \u2212 \u03b11 ) \u223c\n\n\u2206I\n2\u03c0\n.\n\u223c 1.8 nm\nI\n\u03bbL\n\n(9)\n\nThe ultimate precision of the phase shifter calibration is thus given by the number of effective bits for the D/A\nconverter generating the phase shifter voltage. 13 effective bits (see section 4.5) correspond to 0.23 nm 2\u03c0/\u03bbL .\nThis calibration precision is reached after about 60 voltage sweeps. For an experimental test see Rabien et al.3\n(2008).\n6.1.3 DDL Monitoring / Calibration\nThe measured phase difference with the metrology calibration sensor diode is given in equation 8. For fixed\nDDLB1 settings the observed phase shift is only a function of DDLA1 and the phase shifter setting (and vice\nversa). By applying phase shifts \u03b1i = 0, \u03c0/2, \u03c0, 3\u03c0/2 one can use the ABCD algorithm to measure changes in\nthe DDLB1 length.\n\n6.2 Metrology Zero-Point Calibration\nThe strategy for the metrology zero-point calibration is to observe two nearby bright stars and to swap the two\nstars from beam combiner A to B and vice versa. In the first calibration step we observe the two stars and obtain\nthe following measurements: \u03a8A,cal, \u03a8B,cal , \u03a61,cal , \u03a62,cal . We then swap the two stars from one beam combiner to\nswap\nthe other one. During this step we record the change in the metrology phases, \u2206\u03a6swap\n1,cal and \u2206\u03a62,cal . Combining\nthese eight measurements and using equation 4, we get:\n\u0011 1\u0010\n\u0011\u03bb\n1\u0010\ns\nswap\nswap\n\u22061 \u2212 \u22062 = \u03a61,cal \u2212 \u03a62,cal +\n\u2206\u03a6swap\n\u03a8A,cal + \u03a8swap\n.\n(10)\n1,cal \u2212 \u2206\u03a62,cal \u2212\nA,cal \u2212 \u03a8B,cal \u2212 \u03a8B,cal\n2\n2\n\u03bbL\n\n6.3 Metrology Polarization Adjustment\nThe whole optical chain from the IR metrology laser to the metrology fiber positioner is designed with polarization\nmaintaining fibers. The polarization axis is adjusted to the key of the FC connectors to within 2\u25e6 . Also the\nrotational fiber alignment in the fiber adapter of the fiber positioner will be done with a maximum tolerance\nof 2\u25e6 . The metrology laser light will be injected with a high degree of linear polarization along the slow axis\nof the IO. In the full GRAVITY setup there will be eight fibered polarization rotators in front of the IO, see\nPerrin et al.10 (2010), one for each of the two stars times four telescopes. Adjusting the fibered polarization\ncontrollers in front of the IO for maximum fringe contrast on the science targets needs six degrees of freedom of\nthe eight rotators. A seventh degree of freedom is sufficient to adjust the relative polarization between the two\nstars yielding maximum fringe contrast of the metrology light at the telescope.\n\n7.

For a 2 W metrology laser, the total intensity (two\nbeams) at the UT is 4.5 mW. According to Gitton16 (2010) the VLTI transmission in the AT DF case is less\n(18%) resulting in a laser power of 2.9 mW at the AT. In case of on-axis observations, half of the science light\nis used for the AO (see Gillessen et al.1 2010), such that only half of the metrology light power can be observed\non M2, 2.25mW.\nThe contrast of the metrology laser fringes at the telescopes is determined by three effects:\n1. power differences (0.87/1.13) between the laser light from beam combiners A and B, see table 2.\n2. contrast loss due to dOPD change caused by sky rotation during one metrology exposure (1/(30 Hz)) of\nmax. 78 nm/s or 2.6 nm/exposure, see section 7.2\n3. contrast loss due to pupil position jitter of max. 15 mm, see Pfuhl et al.11 (2010).\nThese three effects result in a minimum visibility of the metrology fringe pattern in M1 space of at least 0.9,\nwhich is used in the simulations of the phase extraction performance in section 7.3.2.\n\n7.2 DDL Control Loop Stability\nThe metrology signal will be used in two places: In the data reduction, it is one of the elements delivering the\nfinal phase accuracy. Online, the metrology serves as a measurement device for a control loop keeping the DDL\nat the required position. The accuracy by which the loop has to stay at the desired position (i.e. that the\nwhite-light fringe is matched onto the science channel) is not to be confused with the astrometric accuracy. For\nthe loop, an accuracy of \u03bb/10 is sufficient. This is given by the fact that the visibility loss due to the jitter in the\nDDL loop shall not be limiting. The loop is sketched in Figure 5. For each observation, the theoretical dOPD\nvalue as a function of time needs to be known. This is a geometrical model, the input of which is mainly the\nsource coordinates and the wide-angle baseline. While the coordinates can be safely assumed to be known to\nsufficient accuracy, the requirement to be able to track the dOPD translates into a requirement on how well the\nbaseline is known, see Lacour et al.4 (2010). Here, the problem is to ensure that the calculated dOPD track\nactually is followed by the system, hence dOPD is the quantity to control. The control loop is a classical feedback\nsystem. The adjustable element is the DDL. As shown by Perrin et al.10 (2010), the actual hardware device has\na pronounced hysteresis. This is one of the reasons why dOPD needs to be controlled and a feed-forward system\nis not sufficient. The maximum dOPD occurring is 4 mm, for which the hysteresis reaches 0.025% = 1\u03bcm \u223c \u03bb/2.\n\n\fFigure 5. Basic design of the control loop for the DDL using the metrology feedback. Either the UT or AT feedback loop\nis used. In both cases, it might happen that the science object is bright enough to detect the white light fringe online.\nThen this is the most immediate feedback and should be used instead.\n\nEven though most of the time the dOPD values will be much smaller, the design of the system should under no\ncondition fail due to the hysteresis. The feed-back of the system is primarily optical. This means that dOPD\nis measured (and not the voltage applied to the DDL). Hence, the optical feedback removes the influence of the\nhysteresis. The actual feedback signal depends on the operation mode. For the UTs, the signal is extracted\nfrom each quadruple of ABCD images, for the ATs from a quadruple measurement of the diodes mounted on\nthe M3 spider arm. In addition, there might be cases in which the science object is bright enough to retrieve the\nposition of the white light fringe during the observation, e.g. when observing bright enough binaries. Then this\nis the ideal feedback system. Hence, either the metrology signal or even the actual science signal can be used to\nclose the loop. For the sake of loop stability we do not foresee having a mixed sensing mode, meaning that the\ndecision which feedback signal to use is an either-or decision at the beginning of an observation. The loop rate\nis given by the speed at which the metrology delivers its signal, i.e. 30 Hz. This means that the loop frequency\nwill be in the few Hz range, i.e. the DDL loop is a relatively slow system. This is sufficient given the maximum\ndOPD change rates of 31 nm/s (UTs) and 78 nm/s (ATs). Assuming conservatively that the combination of\nOPD model and DDLs will work without feedback with a precision of 10% (for a short amount of time), the\nmaximum deviation rate that can occur is 7.8 nm/s. Then the maximum possible deviation equals the statistical\naccuracy by which the phase is measured for an exposure time of 1.4 s. This will be the characteristic time scale\nfor the control loop. This means that the dOPD is kept at all times within \u00b111 nm from the nominal value (but\nthe averaged accuracy after some minutes is much better of course).\nThe stability of the loop crucially depends on the accuracy of the phase measurements. The loop would\nbreak, if phase changes larger than \u03c0/2 would occur. We require that a phase error of \u03c0/4 corresponds to a\nstatistical fluctuation of 6\u03c3. This leads to the requirement of \u2206\u03c6 < \u03c0/4/6 = 0.13. As shown in section 7.3 the\nphase accuracy is always much better than that. The loop can also monitor the phase changes it measures, which\nin turn allows for a health check. The stability requirement is also driving the decision whether one can track\ndOPD on the science object or not. This should only be done if the position of the white light fringe can be\nretrieved with sufficient accuracy, meaning well below \u03c0/2. Another issue is mechanical stability. The metrology\nsystem intrinsically relies on the assumption that any mechanical disturbance does not lead to phase changes\nlarger than \u03c0/2. There is no way to recover this sort of error. It can only be recovered by tracking the dOPD\nwith the science channel itself.\n\n7.3 Phase Extraction Performance\nThe measured dOPD is the product of phase and wavelength (see section 7.4). Therefore, the phase recovery is\nan important contributor to the dOPD measurement.\n\n\f7.3.1 Theoretical Calculations\nThe sensitivity of the measured phase in the ABCD algorithm to uncorrelated noise can be calculated analytically\nby simple error propagation:\n1 \u2206I\n\u2206\u03c6 = \u221a\n,\n(11)\n2 hIi\nwhere hIi is the average intensity over one ABCD cycle and \u2206I is the RMS noise of one of the intensity\nmeasurements A, B, C and D.\nThe calculation above assumes completely uncorrelated errors as is the case for the background and read-out\nnoise of the IR camera and IR diodes. The power output of the IR laser fluctuates with a white noise spectrum.\nThe temporal correlation of the fluxes results in smaller phase errors than in the uncorrelated case. We have\nchecked this explicitly by simulating white noise laser light curves. Moreover, there is a spatial correlation\nbetween the signals of the individual pixels of the IR camera. Taking an average over the whole pupil (the case\nof measuring via M2 on the UTs) yields virtually no phase error due to intensity noise of the laser.\nWe conclude, that the analytical formula 11 is correct for uncorrelated intensity fluctuation and is a conservative estimate in case of a realistic noise model.\n7.3.2 UT Simulations\nIn order to verify the metrology system design we simulated the scattering pattern on M2 and its observation\nwith the IR camera. In parallel, we also simulated the signals received from the scatterers. Thus, for each\nsimulated image, we extracted two phase measurements, one based on M2 and one based on the scatterers. More\nspecifically, the simulation parameters were:\n\u2022 visibility of fringe pattern: 0.9\n\u2022 object separation 1\", at a random angle\n\u2022 distance camera to M2 / scatterers: 9.5 m\n\u2022 IR camera: 220 electrons read-noise, 35% quantum efficiency\n\u2022 Exposure time: 33 ms\n\u2022 optics: f /0.9, 71% transmission, including laser line filter for background rejection\n\u2022 scatterers: (2.5 \u00d7 2.5) cm2 size, albedo 0.8, scattering coefficient 2.5 \u00d7 10\u22124 /sr (Rabien et al.3 2008).\nFor the phase extraction, various levels of laser power (measured as total power arriving on M2, i.e. the sum of\nthe two beams) have been investigated. If no phase\n\u221a information could be retrieved at all due to a too low laser\npower, one expects an RMS phase scatter of 2\u03c0/ 12. At a high laser power, the intensity noise of the laser is\nultimately the limiting factor. For a single scatterer, the phase error due to intensity noise is given by equation\n11, while for the measurement via M2, the intensity noise averages out since at each point in time many pixels\nsample the full fringe pattern. In order to illustrate this, we have included an artificially high \u221a\nintensity noise in\nthe simulation. In the regime in-between, one expects that the phase error diminishes with 1/ SNR. Thus, for\neach power level, we generated a set of 100 ABCD sequences and for each cycle extracted the phase in two ways.\nBy taking the average and RMS of each set, we were able to measure the accuracy of the algorithm. The final\ncompilation of phase error versus laser power is shown in Figure 6. It fully confirms the theoretically expected\nbehavior at the low and high flux end.\nThe chosen design yields total laser powers on M2 of 4.5mW (off-axis AO case) and 2.25mW (on-axis AO\ncase) for UT observations, see table 2. This corresponds to phase uncertainties per ABCD cycle of 0.025 rad\nand 0.05 rad. A phase error of 0.13 rad (see section 7.2) corresponds to a total laser power of 1 mW. This is a\nhard limit below which the GRAVITY system would not work reliably.\n\n\fFigure 6. Phase error as a function of (total) laser power on M2. The blue dots are for the phase signal extracted from\nthe scatterers. The red dots use the image on M2. At low fluxes, the phase error reaches asymptotically the value of a\nflat distribution. At high fluxes, the signal from a single scatterer is dominated by the intensity noise, which here was\nchosen for illustrative purpose to be artificially high with 1%. The regime in which the GRAVITY metrology will work\nat 4.5 mW, leading to a phase error of 0.025 rad.\n\n7.3.3 AT Performance\nA field of view of 8\" corresponds to 40 fringes of the metrology laser light. A full fringe is 50 mm wide on the\n2 m diameter mirror M1. According to table 2 the total power of the metrology laser (two beams, red and green)\nat the telescope is 2.9 mW. According to section 4.5 we sample the fringe with an aperture of 10 mm diameter.\nTherefore, we expect a flux on the diode of: IA + IB = 7.2 * 10\u22128 W. The average intensity over one ABCD phase\nshift cycle is then hIA + IB i = 1/2(IA + IB ) = 3.6 * 10\u22128 W . According to the specifications (see section 4.5) the\nerror of the intensity measurement is dominated by the noise of the amplifier of < 3 * 10\u221212 A/Hz1/2 . Together\nwith a response of the diode of 1 A/W this results in a noise equivalent power per 33 ms exposure (phase shifter\ntime step) of NEP= 1.7 * 10\u221211 W.\nAccording to equation 11 the statistical phase error \u2206\u03c6 per 33 ms exposure (calculated from the last 4 ABCD\nmeasurements) is given by:\n1\nNEP\n2\u03c0\n\u2206\u03c6 = \u221a\n.\n(12)\n= 3.4 * 10\u22124 = 0.11 nm\n\u03bbL\n2 hIA + IB i\n\nTherefore, the total uncertainty of the phase measurement will rather be dominated by the uncertainties in\nthe phase shifter calibration and other systematic effects due to a sampling of the fringe pattern in the pupil as\ncompared to the case of the UTs, where the full pupil image can be analyzed.\n\n7.4 Differential OPD Extraction Performance Budget\nThe performance of the instrumental differential OPD measurement is subject to the error contributions outlined\nin table 3. The metrology system fulfills the performance requirement (section 2.1) of a phase measurement within\n3 minutes to an accuracy of 1 nm. The performance of the metrology system is dominated by systematic effects\nlike precision of measurement equipment and calibration stability.\n\n8. CONCLUSIONS AND OUTLOOK\nIn this document we have presented the preliminary design of a metrology system for the GRAVITY instrument.\nWe have shown that the presented preliminary design fulfills the physical requirements. With this preliminary\nsystem design we can measure the differential phase between the two-object beam paths with 1 nm accuracy in\nonly 3 minutes. Systematic errors are widely excluded, due to the mapping of the full pupil over the full VLTI\nand telescope beam train. We have defined detailed requirements for each sub-component of the metrology\nsystem.\n\n\f#\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n\nPhase error contribution\n\nvalue\n\nPhase error\n3 min, 2\", UT\n< 0.21 nm\n< 0.04 nm\n< 0.04 nm\n< 0.01 nm\n< 0.38 nm\n< 0.08 nm\n< 0.5 nm\n< 0.5 nm\n\nPhase error\n3 min, 2\", AT\n< 0.78 nm\n< 0.04 nm\n< 0.04 nm\n< 0.01 nm\n< 0.38 nm\n< 0.08 nm\n< 0.5 nm\n\nwavelength uncertainty IR laser\n< 30 MHz\nintensity noise IR laser\n< 0.5% per 33 ms\nphase shifter amplitude modulation\n< 0.5% per 33 ms\namplitude modulation IO coupling jitter\n< 0.1% per 33 ms\nphase shifter calibration + stability\n< \u03bb/5000\namplitude variation in VLTI train\n< 1% per 33 ms\nmetrology zero-point calibration + stability\n< 0.5 nm\nmetrology receiver noise (UTs)\n< 0.06rad per 33 ms\nmetrology receiver noise (ATs)\n< 0.01rad per 33 ms\n< 0.11 nm\nTotal\n< 0.84 nm\n< 1.0 nm\nTable 3. dOPD measurement performance error budget for the UT and AT case.\n\nREFERENCES\n1.
