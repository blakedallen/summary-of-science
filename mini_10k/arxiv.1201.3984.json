In 2006\nZur Izakhian [10] defined the notion of independence for columns (rows) of as matrix with\ncoefficients in a supertropical semiring. Restricting this concept to the superboolean semiring SB (see Subsection 2.4), and then to the subset of boolean matrices (equals matrices\nwith coefficients 0 and 1), we obtain the notion of independence of columns (rows) of a\nboolean matrix. This notion has several equivalent formulations (see Subsection 2.4 of this\npaper and references there), one involving permanent, another being the following: if M is\nan m \u00d7 n boolean matrix, then a subset J of columns of M is independent if and only if\nthere exists a subset I of rows of M with |I| = |J| = k and the k \u00d7 k submatrix M [I, J]\ncan be put into upper triangular form (1's on the diagonal, 0's strictly above it, and 0's or\n1's below it) by independently permuting the rows and columns of M [I, J].\nThis is the notion of independence for columns of a boolean matrix we will use in this\npaper. In 2008 the first author suggested that this idea would have application in many\nbranches of Mathematics and especially in Combinatorial Mathematics. In this paper we\napply it to the vertices of a finite graph. For other applications of this notion to lattices,\nposets and matroids by Izhakian and the first author, see [11, 12, 13].\nIf M is an m \u00d7 n boolean matrix with column space C, then the set H of independent\nsubsets of C satisfies the following axioms (see [11, 12]):\n(H) H is nonempty and closed under taking subsets (making it a hereditary collection);\n(PR) for all nonempty J, {p} \u2208 H, there exists some x \u2208 J such that (J \\ {x}) \u222a {p} \u2208 H\n(the point replacement property).\nHereditary collections arising from some boolean matrix M as above are said to be boolean\nrepresentable. A very interesting question is which hereditary collections have boolean\nrepresentations, a question which the authors will address in a near future paper [18].\nThe elementary properties of such boolean representable collections were considered in\n[11, 12, 13] and it was shown in [12] that all matroids have boolean representations.\nIn this paper we restrict our atention to finite graphs (with no loops and no multiple\nedges), see Subsection 2.2. However, there are several ways to define such a graph by a\nboolean matrix. The one chosen in matroid theory by Whitney [20] and related to the\nLevi graph is to attach the boolean matrix M (G) to the graph G = (V, E), where V is the\nset of vertices and E the set of edges considered as 2-sets of V , with M (G) the |V | \u00d7 |E|\nboolean matrix defined by M (G)(v, e) = 1 if v lies in e, and 0 otherwise. Now whether we\n2\n\n\fconsider the columns of M (G) as independent in our boolean sense or in the usual vector\nspace sense (over the field Z2 ), we obtain the same independent sets which form a matroid\ncalled a graphical matroid, see [11, 16, 17].\nSo this viewpoint has been extensively worked out [16, 17], and mainly following Tutte's\nsuggestions, ideas from graphs like connectedness (n-connected) can be extended to matroids, etc.\nA perhaps more obvious way to associate a boolean matrix to a graph G = (V, E) is via\nthe |V | \u00d7 |V | boolean adjacency matrix (see Subsection 2.2) AG = (aij ), where aij = 1 if\n{i, j} is an edge of G, and 0 otherwise. So AG can be an arbitrary symmetric square boolean\nmatrix with 0's in the main diagonal (see also [2]). However, in this paper we choose AcG\nwhich is AG with 0 and 1 interchanged. This approach is indicated from the lattice/poset\ncase [13], and that finite boolean modules (equals semilattices) have dual spaces which\nseparate points and the dual space is reversing the order, see [19, Chapter 9.1 and 9.2].\nAlso if AG were used, then Kn (the complete graph on n vertices) and its complement\nKn would have sets of 2 or less vertices being the independent sets or only the empty set\nbeing independent respectively, clearly not a good choice.\nThus our new notion of independence of a subset of vertices X \u2286 V of a graph G = (V, E)\nis that the columns corresponding to X in AcG are boolean independent. Note that, by using\nAcG , all subsets of vertices of Kn are independent. This is termed c-independence for vertices\nof G, and the cardinality of the largest independent set of vertices ia termed c-rank, denoted\nc-rk . Note that we work with the superboolean semiring SB, for representation by matrices\nover GF (2) the reader can be referred to a recent paper by Brijder and Traldi [2].\nAs we mentioned before, Whitney associated to each finite graph G = (V, E) a (graphical) matroid [20]. In this paper we more or less reverse this procedure and treat each\ngraph G as given \"like a matroid\" in the following manner. The graph G has the boolean\nrepresentation AcG = M . Each boolean representation M , see [12, 13, 18], gives rise to the\nlattice of flats (see Subsection 2.2) of M . This corresponds to the idea in matroid theory\nof the geometric lattice of flats of a matroid (see [16]). Given the boolean matrix M with\ncolumn space C, the lattice of flats of M consists of the subsets of C corresponding to where\nthe rows of M are zero, closed under all intersections (see Subsection 2.2). Then Theorem\n3.1 yields that the independent subsets of C with respect to M are the partial transversals\nof the partition of successive differences for some maximal chain of the lattice of flats. This\nrelates to earlier ideas of Bjorner and Ziegler [1].\nIf L is the geometric lattice of flats of a matroid P = (C, H), then taking the boolean\nrepresentation ML corresponding to L and restricted to the atom generators (ML is AcL\n\u2013 where AL is the L incidence matrix \u2013 restricted to the atom rows C, then transposed\nso considered as columns), then the lattice of flats of the boolean matrix ML as described\nbefore is the same as the geometric lattice of usual flats of the matroid (see [12]). Thus this\napproach truly generalizes the matroid approach.\nWhen applying this \"boolean combinatorics\" approach to some standard field of Mathematics (e.g. finite graph theory), usually the notion of rank is well known, the notion of\nindependence is new, and the approach tends quickly to some well developed subfield of the\nsubject under study. Somehow geometry is also supposed to show up in this approach: see\nbelow!\nEnough of the general background. In this paper the boolean representation for a graph\n3\n\n\fis AcG and the notions of c-independence and c-rank are taken with respect to AcG . The\nlattice of flats for the graph G = (V, E) can be realised by closing {St(v) | v \u2208 V } under\nall intersections, where St(v) = {v 0 \u2208 V | {v, v 0 } \u2208 E}. This and other preliminaries are\ndone in Section 2. The c-rank and how to calculate the c-independent subsets of vertices\nare discussed in Section 3. It is proved that the c-rank is the height of the lattice of flats\nand c-independent subsets can be calculated by Theorem 3.1(iv)-(v).\nIn Section 4 we characterize graphs of low c-rank. Section 5 is devoted to the interesting case of sober connected graphs of c-rank 3 (we call a graph sober if the mapping St is\ninjective). In Section 6, our new notions acquire a distinctive geometric flavor in connection with Levi graphs and partial euclidean geometries. Geo is defined in the appropriate\ncontext and Geo of the Petersen graph is computed to be the Desargues configuration, see\nExample 6.3. Section 7 collects results concerning cubic graphs, including characterizations\nof the graphs whose lattice of flats satisfies the most famous lattice-theoretic properties. A\nvariation of the concept of c-rank appropriate to deal with minors is discussed in Section\n8. Finally, Section 9 relates a graph and its complement graph in the context of our new\nnotions.\n\n2\n2.1\n\nPreliminaries\nPosets and lattices\n\nOur lattice and poset terminology is more or less standard (see [7, 8, 15, 19]). For ease\nof exposition we assume all posets, lattices and graphs to be finite, although many of the\nresults admit generalizations to the infinite case.\nGiven a finite poset (P, \u2264) and p, q \u2208 P , we say that p covers q if p > q but there is\nno r \u2208 P such that p > r > q. It is standard to represent finite posets by means of their\nHasse diagram: in this directed graph, the vertices are the elements of P and (p, q) is an\nedge when p covers q. Note that a chain in (P, \u2264) is maximal if and only if it corresponds\nto some path in the Hasse diagram connecting a maximal element to a minimal element.\nThe height of (P, \u2264) is defined by\nht P = max{k \u2208 IN | p0 < p1 < . . . < pk is a chain in P }.\nEquivalently, ht P is the maximum length of a path in the Hasse diagram of P .\nWe say that (P, \u2264) is a lattice if, for all p, q \u2208 P , there exist\np \u2228 q = min{x \u2208 P | x \u2265 p, q},\np \u2227 q = max{x \u2208 P | x \u2264 p, q}.\nIf only the first (respectively the second) of these conditions is satisfied, we talk of a \u2228semilattice (respectively \u2227-semilattice). We say that P 0 \u2286 P constitutes a sublattice of\n(P, \u2264) if p \u2228 q, p \u2227 q \u2208 P 0 for all p, q \u2208 P 0 . Note there need be no relation between the top\n(bottom) of P 0 and of P . Every point is a sublattice.\nA lattice (L, \u2264) is said to be distributive if\np \u2227 (q \u2228 r) = (p \u2227 r) \u2228 (p \u2227 r)\n4\n\n\fholds for all p, q, r \u2208 L, a condition which is equivalent to its dual. We shall say that (L, \u2264)\nis modular if there is no sublattice of the form\na\nb\n\n\u007f\n\u0017\n\n\u000f\n\nc\n\nd\n\n\u001f \u007f\n\ne\n\nIf we only exclude such sublattices when d covers e, the lattice is semimodular. It is well\nknown that every distributive lattice is modular, and modular implies of course semimodular.\nAn atom of L is an element covering the minimum element 0. A semimodular latice\nis called geometric if every element is a join of atoms (0 being the join of the empty set).\nFinally, L satisfies the Jordan-Dedekind condition if all the maximal chains in L have the\nsame length.\n\n2.2\n\nGraphs\n\nThroughout this paper, graphs are finite, undirected, and have neither loops nor multiple\nedges. Formally, a (finite) graph is an ordered pair G = (V, E), where V is a (finite) set\n(the set of vertices) and E \u2286 {X \u2208 2V : |X| = 2} (the set of edges). In other words, the\nedges are 2-subsets of V (an n-subset is a subset with n elements). We assume the reader\nto be familiar with the basic concepts of graph theory (see e.g. [6]).\nClearly, (2V , \u2286) is a distributive lattice with X \u2227 Y = X \u2229 Y and X \u2228 Y = X \u222a Y . If\nX \u2286 V has k elements, we say it is a k-subset of V .\nGiven S \u2286 2V , it is easy to see that\nSb = {\u2229S | S \u2286 S}\nb and also V =\nis the \u2227-subsemilattice of (2V , \u2286) generated by S. Note that \u2229S = minS,\nb\nb\n\u2229\u2205 = maxS. In fact, (S, \u2286) is itself a lattice with\nP \u2228 Q = \u2229{X \u2208 S | P \u222a Q \u2286 X}.\nb \u2286) is not in general a sublattice of (2V , \u2286) since P \u2228 Q (in (S,\nb \u2286)) needs not\nHowever, (S,\nbe P \u222a Q (see [7, 19]).\nNote that\nht Sb \u2264 |S|\n(1)\nsince any chain in Sb is necessarily of the form\nV \u2287 X1 \u2283 X1 \u2229 X2 \u2283 . . . \u2283 X1 \u2229 . . . \u2229 Xk\nfor distinct X1 , . . . , Xk \u2208 S.\n5\n\n\fFinally, we say that {y1 , . . . , yk } is a transversal of the partition of the successive differences for the chain X0 \u2283 . . . \u2283 Xk in Sb if yi \u2208 Xi\u22121 \\ Xi for i = 1, . . . , k. A subset of a\ntransversal is a partial transversal.\nGiven v \u2208 V , the star of v is defined by\nSt(v) = {w \u2208 V | w is adjacent to v in G}.\nMore generally, given W \u2286 V , we write\nSt(W ) = \u2229w\u2208W St(w).\nNote that St(\u2205) = V . Let SW = {St(w) | w \u2208 W }. It is immediate that\n0\n0\nd\nS\nW = {St(W ) | W \u2286 W }.\n\n(2)\n\nWe call a subset of the form St(W ) (W \u2208 V ) a flat and say that Sc\nV is the lattice of flats of\nG, also denoted by Fl G. We believe this to be a new concept for graphs.\nNote that, for a connected graph G = (V, E), we can define a metric d on V by\nd(v, w) = length of the shortest path connecting v and w (counting edges).\nThe diameter of G, denoted by diam G, is the maximum value in the image of d.\nGiven a finite graph G, the girth of G, denoted by gth G, is the length of the shortest\ncycle in G (assumed to be \u221e is G is acyclic). Note that gth G \u2265 3 for any finite graph.\nWe shall use the notation\nn\u0302 = {1, . . . , n}\nthroughout the paper. Assume now that V = n\u0302. The adjacency matrix of G = (V, E) is the\nn \u00d7 n boolean matrix AG = (aij ) defined by\n\u001a\n1 if {i, j} \u2208 E\naij =\n0 otherwise\nThe matrix AcG is obtained by interchanging 0 and 1 all over AG . If the graph is clear from\nthe context, we shall write just A and Ac .\n\n2.3\n\nMatroids\n\nLet V be a set and let X \u2286 2V . We say that X is a hereditary collection if X is closed under\ntaking subsets. The hereditary collection is said to be a matroid if the following condition\n(the exchange property) holds:\n(EP) For all I, J \u2208 X with |I| = |J| + 1, there exists some i \u2208 I \\ J such that J \u222a {i} \u2208 X.\nThere are many other equivalent definitions of matroid. For details, the reader is referred\nto [16].\n\n6\n\n\f2.4\n\nSuperboolean matrices\n\nFollowing [11], we shall view boolean matrices as matrices over the superboolean semiring\nSB = {0, 1, 1\u03bd }, where addition and multiplication are described respectively by\n+\n0\n1\n1\u03bd\n\n0\n0\n1\n1\u03bd\n\n1\n1\n1\u03bd\n1\u03bd\n\n1\u03bd\n1\u03bd\n1\u03bd\n1\u03bd\n\n*\n0\n1\n1\u03bd\n\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n1\n0\n1\n1\u03bd\n\n1\u03bd\n0\n1\u03bd\n1\u03bd\n\nWe denote by Mn (SB) the set of all n \u00d7 n matrices with entries in SB. Note that n \u00d7 n\nboolean matrices are not a subsemiring of Mn (SB) since 1 + 1 = 1\u03bd .\nNext we present definitions of independency and rank appropriate to the context of\nsuperboolean matrices, introduced in [10] (see also [11]).\nWe say that vectors C1 , . . . , Cm \u2208 SBn are dependent if \u03bb1 C1 + . . . \u03bbm Cm \u2208 {0, 1\u03bd } for\nsome \u03bb1 , . . . , \u03bbm \u2208 {0, 1} not all zero. Otherwise, they are said to be independent.\nLet Sn denote the symmetric group on n\u0302. The permanent of a matrix M \u2208 Mn (SB) (a\npositive version of the determinant) is defined by\nPer M =\n\nn\nX Y\n\nmi,i\u03c3 .\n\n\u03c3\u2208Sn i=1\n\nRecall that addition and multiplication take place in the semiring SB defined above.\nGiven I, J \u2286 n\u0302, we denote by M [I, J] the submatrix of M with entries mij (i \u2208 I, j \u2208 J).\nIn particular, M [n\u0302, j] denotes the jth column vector of M for each j \u2208 n\u0302.\nProposition 2.1 [10, Th. 2.10], [11, Lemma 3.2] The following conditions are equivalent\nfor every M \u2208 Mn (SB):\n(i) the column vectors M [n\u0302, 1], . . . , M [n\u0302, n] are independent;\n(ii) Per M = 1;\n(iii) M can be transformed into some lower triangular matrix of the form\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n1 0 0 ... 0\n\uf8ec ? 1 0 . . . 0\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec ? ? 1 . . . 0\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec .. .. .. . . .. \uf8f7\n\uf8ed. . . . .\uf8f8\n\n(3)\n\n? ? ? ... 1\nby permuting rows and permuting columns independently.\nA square matrix satisfying the above (equivalent) conditions is said to be nonsingular.\nGiven (equipotent) I, J \u2286 n\u0302, we say that I is a witness for J in M if M [I, J] is nonsingular.\nProposition 2.2 [10, Th. 3.11] The following conditions are equivalent for all M \u2208\nMn (SB) and J \u2286 {1, . . . , n}:\n7\n\n\f(i) the column vectors M [n\u0302, j] (j \u2208 J) are independent;\n(ii) J has a witness in M .\nThe subsets of independent column vectors of a given superboolean matrix, which include the empty subset and are closed for subsets, constitute an important example of a\nhereditary collection. Hereditary collections which have boolean representations, which include matroids as a very important particular case, were discussed in [11, 12, 13] and will\nbe also the object of a future paper by the present authors, seeking necessary and sufficient\nconditions.\nProposition 2.3 [10, Th. 3.11] The following are equal for a given M \u2208 Mn (SB):\n(i) the maximum number of independent column vectors in M ;\n(ii) the maximum number of independent row vectors in M ;\n(iii) the maximum size of a subset J \u2286 n\u0302 having a witness in M ;\n(iv) the maximum size of a nonsingular submatrix of M .\nThe rank of a matrix M \u2208 Mn (SB), denoted by rk M , is the number described above.\nA row of M is called an n-marker if it has one entry 1 and all the remaining entries are 0.\nThe following remark follows from Proposition 2.1:\nCorollary 2.4 [11, Cor. 3.4] If M \u2208 Mn (SB) is nonsingular, then it has an n-marker.\n\n3\n\nThe c-rank of a graph\n\nIn this section, we assume that G = (V, E) denotes a finite graph with V = n\u0302.\nThe following result prepares the ground for an important connection between matrix\nrank and the height of the lattice of flats as defined in Subsection 2.2, and will acquire great\nrelevance in the study of independence. This relates to earlier work by Bjorner and Ziegler\n[1].\nTheorem 3.1 Given a finite graph G, the following conditions are equivalent for every\nJ \u2286 n\u0302:\n(i) the column vectors Ac [n\u0302, j] (j \u2208 J) are independent;\n(ii) J has a witness in Ac ;\ncJ = |J|;\n(iii) ht S\n(iv) J is a transversal of the partition of successive differences for some chain of Fl G;\n(v) J is a partial transversal of the partition of successive differences for some maximal\nchain of Fl G.\n\n8\n\n\fProof. We may assume that J is nonempty.\n(i) \u21d4 (ii). By Proposition 2.2.\n(ii) \u21d2 (iii). Let I be a witness for J in Ac . Permuting rows and columns if necessary, we\nmay assume that Ac [I, J] is of the form (3). Write k = |J| and let i1 , . . . , ik and j1 , . . . , jk\nindicate the new ordering of rows and columns in the reordered matrix. Then the reordered\nA[I, J] is of the form\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n0 1 1 ... 1\n\uf8ec ? 0 1 . . . 1\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec ? ? 0 . . . 1\uf8f7\n(4)\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec .. .. .. . . .. \uf8f7\n\uf8ed. . . . .\uf8f8\n? ? ? ... 0\nand so\nSt(jr , . . . , jk ) \u2229 I = {i1 , . . . , ir\u22121 }\nfor r = 1, . . . , k. Since jk \u2208\n/ Stjk , we get\nV = St(\u2205) \u2283 Stjk \u2283 St(jk\u22121 , jk ) \u2283 . . . \u2283 St(j1 , . . . , jk )\n\n(5)\n\ncJ \u2265 k. Hence ht S\ncJ = k by (1).\nand so ht S\n(iii) \u21d2 (ii). In view of (1), it is easy to see that we must have necessarily a chain of\nthe form (5), where J = {j1 , . . . , jk } and the jr are all distinct. For r = 1, . . . , k \u2212 1, take\nir \u2208 St(jr+1 , . . . , jk )\\St(jr ), and also ik = jk . With the rows (respectively columns) ordered\nby i1 , . . . , ik (respectively j1 , . . . , jk ), the matrix Ac [I, J] is now of the form (3) and so I is\na witness for J in Ac .\n(ii) \u21d2 (iv). Let I = {i1 , . . . , ik } be a witness for J = {i1 , . . . , jk } in Ac . Similarly to the\nproof of (ii) \u21d2 (iii), we may assume that A[I, J] is of the form (4) and so\nSt(i1 , . . . , ir ) \u2229 J = {jr+1 , . . . , jk }\nfor r = 1, . . . , k. Hence\nV = St(\u2205) \u2283 St(i1 ) \u2283 St(i1 , i2 ) \u2283 . . . \u2283 St(i1 , . . . , ik )\n\n(6)\n\nis a chain in Fl G. Since jr \u2208 St(i1 , . . . , ir\u22121 ) \\ St(ir ), then J is a transversal for (6).\n(iv) \u21d2 (ii). Assume that J = {i1 , . . . , jk } is a transversal for a chain\nSt(X0 ) \u2283 St(X1 ) \u2283 . . . \u2283 St(Xk )\nin Fl G. We may assume that jr \u2208 St(Xr\u22121 ) \\ St(Xr ) for r = 1, . . . , k. Then, for each\nr, there exists ir \u2208 Xr such that jr \u2208\n/ St(ir ). However, if s < r, then jr \u2208 St(Xr\u22121 ) \u2286\nSt(Xs ) \u2286 St(is ) and it follows easily that, with the rows (respectively columns) ordered by\ni1 , . . . , ik (respectively j1 , . . . , jk ), the matrix Ac [I, J] is now of the form (3) and so I is a\nwitness for J in Ac .\n(iv) \u21d2 (v). Since a partial transversal of a maximal chain is a transversal for some\nsubchain of the original chain.\n(v) \u21d2 (iv). Since every chain can be refined to get a maximal chain. \u0003\n9\n\n\fTo simplify terminology, we say that the vertices j1 , . . . , jk \u2208 n\u0302 are c-independent if the\ncolumn vectors Ac [n\u0302, j1 ], . . . , Ac [n\u0302, jk ] are independent.\nRemark 3.2 Let G be a finite graph and let j1 , j2 \u2208 n\u0302. Then:\n(i) j1 is c-independent;\n(ii) j1 , j2 are c-independent if and only if St(j1 ) 6= St(j2 ).\nIn particular, j1 , j2 are c-independent if they are adjacent.\nProof. (i) This follows from every column vector in Ac being nonzero due to the absence\nof loops in G.\n(ii) Since every column vector in Ac is nonzero, it follows from Theorem 3.1 that j1 , j2\nare c-independent if and only if Ac [n\u0302, j1 ] and Ac [n\u0302, j2 ] are distinct, i.e. St(j1 ) 6= St(j2 ). \u0003\nTheorem 3.3 Let G = (V, E) be a finite graph. Then rk Ac = ht Fl G.\nProof. Let k = rk Ac . Then there exists some J \u2286 n\u0302 such that |J| = k and the column\ncJ = k by Theorem 3.1. Since ht S\ncJ \u2264\nvectors Ac [n\u0302, j] (j \u2208 J) are independent. Hence ht S\nc\nht Sc\nV by (2), it follows that rk A \u2264 ht Fl G.\nAssume now that ht Fl G = `. Then there exists a (maximal) chain\nV = St(\u2205) \u2283 St(V` ) \u2283 . . . \u2283 St(V1 )\n\n(7)\n\nfor some V1 , . . . , V` \u2286 V . We claim that there exist j1 , . . . , j` \u2208 V such that\nSt(jr , . . . , j` ) = St(Vr )\n\n(8)\n\nfor r = 1, . . . , `. Indeed, since St(Vr+1 ) \u2283 St(Vr ), we can take jr \u2208 Vr such that St(Vr+1 ) 6\u2286\nSt(jr ). Writing V`+1 = \u2205, we proceed by induction on r = `, . . . , 1: assume that (8) holds\nfor r + 1. Hence\nSt(Vr+1 ) = St(jr+1 , . . . , j` ) \u2283 St(jr , . . . , j` ) = St(jr ) \u2229 St(jr+1 , . . . , j` ) \u2287 St(Vr )\nand so St(Vr ) = St(jr , . . . , j` ) by the maximality of the length of the chain (7). Thus (8)\nholds.\ncJ \u2264 ht Sc\nTake J = {j1 , . . . , j` }. Since ht S\nV = `, it follows from (7) and (8) that\ncJ = ` = |J| and so the column vectors Ac [n\u0302, j] (j \u2208 J) are independent by Theorem 3.1.\nht S\nThus ht Fl G = ` \u2264 rk Ac and so rk Ac = ht Fl G. \u0003\nWe say that the above number is the c-rank of the graph G and we denote it by c-rk G.\nNote that, in view of Theorem 3.1, c-rk G is also the maximum size of a (partial) transversal\nof the partition of successive differences of a (maximal) chain of Fl G.\nWe present now some straightforward properties of the c-rank of a graph. Let maxdeg G\n(respectively mindeg G) denote the maximum (respectively minimum) degree of a vertex in\nG.\nProposition 3.4 Let G be a finite graph. Then c-rk G \u2264 maxdeg G + 1.\nProof. Since in a chain of the form (7), we have necessarily |St(V` )| \u2264 maxdeg G. \u0003\n10\n\n\fProposition 3.5 Let G be a finite graph with connected components G1 , . . . , Gm . Then\nc-rk G = max{ c-rk G1 , . . . , c-rk Gm }.\nProof. Since in any chain of the form (7), the Vr and the St(Vr ) must necessarily be taken\nin one same connected component. \u0003\nIn view of this result, we may focus our attention, from now on, on connected graphs.\nWe say that G0 = (V 0 , E 0 ) is a subgraph of G = (V, E) if V 0 \u2286 V and E 0 \u2286 E (up to\n0\nisomorphism!). If V 0 \u2286 V and E 0 = E \u2229 2V , we say that G0 is a restriction of G.\nGiven graphs G = (V, E) and G0 = (V 0 , E 0 ), a morphism \u03c6 : G \u2192 G0 is a mapping\n\u03c6 : V \u2192 V 0 such that v\u03c6 \u2212\u2212 w\u03c6 is an edge of G0 whenever v \u2212\u2212 w is an edge of G. We\nsay that \u03c6 is a retraction if G0 is a restriction of G and \u03c6|V 0 is the identity mapping.\nProposition 3.6 Let G = (V, E), G0 = (V 0 , E 0 ) be finite graphs.\n(i) If G0 is a restriction of G, then c-rk G0 \u2264 c-rk G.\n(ii) If G0 is a complete subgraph of G, then c-rk G \u2265 c-rk G0 = |V 0 |.\nProof. (i) If G0 is a restriction of G, then any (nonsingular) submatrix of AcG0 is also a\n(nonsingular) submatrix of AcG .\n(ii) A complete subgraph of G is necessarily a restriction, hence c-rk G \u2265 c-rk G0 by part\n(i). The equality c-rk G0 = |V 0 | follows from the following fact: if Kn denotes the complete\ngraph on n vertices, then AcKn is the identity matrix. \u0003\nNote that c-rk G0 \u2264 c-rk G may not hold if G0 is a mere subgraph of G. For instance, it\nis easy to check that the square\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\nhas c-rank 2, but after removing an edge the c-rank increases (cf. Proposition 4.2).\nWe introduce now a concept that will ease the discussion of c-rank in many circumstances. We call a finite graph G = (V, E) sober if the star mapping St : V \u2192 2v is\ninjective. The following remark is immediate from Remark 3.2:\nRemark 3.7 The following conditions are equivalent for a finite connected graph G:\n(i) G is sober;\n(ii) all 2-subsets of vertices of G are independent.\nProposition 3.8 Let G = (V, E) be a finite connected graph. Then G admits a retraction\nonto a sober connected restriction G0 = (V 0 , E 0 ) such that Fl G \u223c\n= Fl G0 .\nProof. Let V 0 be a cross-section for the star mapping St : V \u2192 2V of G and let G0 be\nthe restriction of G induced by V 0 . It is straightforward that G0 is isomorphic to the graph\nhaving as vertices the equivalence classes of V induced by St and edges X \u2212\u2212 Y whenever\nx \u2212\u2212 y is an edge of G for some x \u2208 X and y \u2208 Y .\n\n11\n\n\fFor every v \u2208 V , let v 0 \u2208 V 0 be the unique vertex in V 0 such that St(v 0 ) = St(v). We\nclaim that, for all v, w \u2208 V ,\n{v, w} \u2208 E \u21d4 {v 0 , w0 } \u2208 E 0 .\n\n(9)\n\nIndeed, if v \u2212\u2212 w is an edge in G, then so is v \u2212\u2212 w0 and therefore v 0 \u2212\u2212 w0 .\nConversely, assume that {v 0 , w0 } \u2208 E 0 \u2286 E. Then we successively get {v, w0 } \u2208 E and\n{v, w} \u2208 E, hence (9) holds. Thus \u03c6 : V \u2192 V 0 defined by v\u03c6 = v 0 is a graph morphism\nfrom G to the restriction G0 , indeed a retraction.\nMoreover, any path v1 \u2212\u2212 . . . \u2212\u2212 vn in G induces a path v10 \u2212\u2212 . . . \u2212\u2212 vn0 in G0 and so\nG0 is connected.\n0\nLet St0 : V 0 \u2192 2V denote the star mapping of G. Suppose that v, w \u2208 V are such that\nSt0 (v 0 ) = St0 (w0 ). It follows from (9) that\nSt(v) = {z \u2208 V | z 0 \u2208 St0 (v 0 )} = {z \u2208 V | z 0 \u2208 St0 (w0 )} = St(w),\nhence v 0 = w0 and so G0 is sober.\nWe claim that\n\n\u03b8 : (Fl G, \u2286) \u2192 (Fl G0 , \u2286)\nSt(W ) 7\u2192 St0 (W 0 )\n\nis an isomorphism of posets (and therefore of lattices).\nIt is immediate that \u03b8 is surjective and preserves order. It remains to show that \u03b8 is\nwell defined and injective.\nFor every W \u2286 V , it follows from (9) that\nSt(W ) = \u2229w\u2208W St(w) = \u2229w\u2208W {x \u2208 V | x0 \u2208 St0 (w0 )} = {x \u2208 V | x0 \u2208 St0 (W 0 )},\nSt0 (W 0 ) = {x \u2208 V | x0 \u2208 \u2229w\u2208W St0 (w0 )}0 = {x \u2208 V | x \u2208 \u2229w\u2208W St(w)}0 = (St(W ))0 .\nTherefore St(W ) = St(Z) \u21d4 St0 (W 0 ) = St0 (Z 0 ) holds for all W, Z \u2286 V and so \u03b8 is an\nisomorphism. \u0003\nHowever, the restriction in Proposition 3.8 does not need to be unique (up to isomorphism). For instance, the graph\n1\n\n2\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\nis itself sober and connected (and has mindeg 2), and so it is the restriction obtained by\nremoving vertex 1. It is easy to check that the star lattices of both graphs are isomorphic\n\n12\n\n\fand of the form:\n\u2022\n\u007f\n\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\n\u007f\n\n\u000f\n\n\u001f\n\n\u2022\n\n\u000f \u007f\n\n\u000f \u007f\n\n\u2022\n\n\u000f\n\n\u2022\n\n\u001f \u000f\n\n'\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u007f\n\n\u2022\n\u001f \u000f\n\n\u2022\n\n\u001f \u000f \u007f\n\n\u2022\n\nIt is easy to characterize sober trees. Recall that a vertex of degree 1 is called a leaf.\nProposition 3.9 A tree T = (V, E) is sober if and only if no two leafs are at distance 2\nfrom each other.\nProof. Indeed, assume that v, w \u2208 V are distinct. If St(v) = St(w) and has more than one\nelement, then T would admit a square and would not be a tree, hence St(v) = St(w) can\nonly occur if both v and w are leafs, in which case St(v) = St(w) is equivalent to d(v, w) = 2.\n\u0003\nWe establish next an inductive relation that may prove useful in the computation of\nthe c-rank. Given a graph G = (V, E), and J \u2286 V , write c-rkG J = rk Ac [V, J]. Note that\nc-rk G = c-rkG V .\nWe recall also that, for X \u2286 V , the graph G \u2212 X is obtained from G by removing all\nthe vertices in X and all the edges adjacent to them.\nTheorem 3.10 Let G = (V, E) be a finite graph and m \u2265 2. Then the following conditions\nare equivalent:\n(i) c-rk G \u2265 m.\n(ii) There exist v, w \u2208 V such that:\n\u2013 St(v) 6= St(w);\n\u2013 c-rkG\u2212{v,w} (St(v)\u2229 St(w)) \u2265 m \u2212 2.\nProof. (i) \u21d2 (ii). If c-rk G \u2265 m, then by Proposition 2.2 there exist I, J \u2286 V such that\nAc [I, J] is nonsingular and |J| = m. In view of Proposition 2.1, we may reorder the rows\n(respectively columns) of Ac [I, J] by i1 , . . . , im (respectively j1 , . . . , jm ) to get a matrix\nof the form (3). Since j2 \u2208 St(i1 ) \\ St(i2 ), we have St(i1 ) 6= St(i2 ). On the other hand,\ni1 , i2 \u2208\n/ {i3 , . . . , im }\u222a{j3 , . . . , jm } since i1 , i2 \u2208 St(j3 , . . . , jm ), hence {i3 , . . . , im } is a witness\nfor {j3 , . . . , jm } in G \\ {i1 , i2 }. Therefore j3 , . . . , jm \u2208 St(i1 ) \u2229 St(i2 ) are c-independent in\nG \\ {i1 , i2 } and so condition (ii) holds.\n(ii) \u21d2 (i). Since c-rkG\u2212{v,w} (St(v) \u2229 St(w)) \u2265 m \u2212 2, there exist distinct j3 , . . . , jm \u2208\nSt(v) \u2229 St(w) and i3 , . . . , im \u2208 V \\ {v, w} such that Ac [i3 , . . . , im ; j3 , . . . , jm ] is nonsingular.\nReordering rows and columns if necessary, we may assume that Ac [i3 , . . . , im ; j3 , . . . , jm ] is of\n13\n\n\fthe form (3). Since St(v) 6= St(w), we may assume that there exists some j2 \u2208 St(v) \\ St(w)\nand take i1 = j1 = v and i2 = w. It is straightforward to check that Ac [i1 , . . . , im ; j1 , . . . , jm ]\nis of the form (3), hence condition (i) holds for J = {j1 , . . . , jm }. \u0003\n\n4\n\nLow c-rank\n\nWe start analyzing the sober cases and go as far as characterizing c-rank 4. In view of\nPropositions 3.5 and 3.8, in the discussion of c-rank \u2265 3 we pay special attention to the\ncase of sober connected graphs.\nProposition 4.1 Let G = (V, E) be a finite graph. Then:\n(i) c-rk G = 0 if and only if V = \u2205.\n(ii) c-rk G = 1 if and only if V 6= \u2205 and E = \u2205.\nProof. Clearly, c-rk G \u2265 0 under all circumstances and the empty graph has c-rank 0. On\nthe other hand, if V 6= \u2205, then Ac has at least one 1 in the diagonal, yielding c-rk G \u2265 1.\nThis proves (i). Moreover, if E 6= \u2205, it follows from Remark 3.2(ii) that c-rk G \u2265 2, thus\n(ii) holds as well. \u0003\nWe recall that a graph G = (V, E) is called bipartite if V admits a nontrivial partition\nV = V1 \u222a V2 such that\nE \u2286 {{v1 , v2 } | v1 \u2208 V1 , v2 \u2208 V2 }.\nIf this inclusion can be made to be an equality, the graph is said to be complete bipartite.\nProposition 4.2 Let G = (V, E) be a finite graph with E 6= \u2205. Then the following conditions are equivalent:\n(i) c-rk G = 2;\n(ii) G has no subgraph v1 \u2212\u2212 v2 \u2212\u2212 v3 with St(v1 ) 6= St(v3 );\n(iii) G is a disjoint union of complete bipartite graphs;\n(iv) G has no restrictions of the following forms:\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\nProof. (i) \u21d2 (ii). Suppose that G has a subgraph v1 \u2212\u2212 v2 \u2212\u2212 v3 with St(v1 ) 6= St(v3 ).\nWe may assume that there exists some w \u2208 St(v1 ) \\ St(v3 ). Consider the chain\nV = St(\u2205) \u2283 St(v1 ) \u2283 St(v1 , v3 ) \u2283 St(v1 , v2 , v3 )\n(taking respectively v1 , w, v2 to show that the inclusions are strict). Thus c-rk G \u2265 3.\n14\n\n\f(ii) \u21d2 (iii). Since (ii) holds, any path\nv1 \u2212\u2212 v2 \u2212\u2212 . . . \u2212\u2212 vk\nmust satisfy St(v1 ) = St(v3 ) = . . . and St(v2 ) = St(v4 ) = . . . Since we may also assume G\nto be connected, it follows that we can take a pair of adjacent edges (w1 , w2 ) and partition\nV = V1 \u222a V2 by\nV1 = {v \u2208 V | St(v) = St(w1 )},\n\nV2 = {v \u2208 V | St(v) = St(w2 )}.\n\nSince w2 \u2208 St(w1 ), we have w2 \u2208 St(v) for every v \u2208 V1 . Hence V1 \u2286 St(w2 ) and\nso V1 \u2286 St(v) for every v \u2208 V2 . On the other hand, if v, v 0 \u2208 V1 are adjacent, then\nv \u2208 St(v 0 ) = St(v), a contradiction. Similarly, no two vertices in V2 can be adjacent. Thus\nG is complete bipartite.\n(iii) \u21d2 (iv). It is well-known that no bipartite graph admits cycles of odd length.\nSuppose that G = (V, E) is bipartite complete (with respect to the partition V = V1 \u222a V2 )\nand has a restriction of the form\nv1 \u2212\u2212 v2 \u2212\u2212 v3 \u2212\u2212 v4 .\n\n(10)\n\nThen {v1 , v3 } and {v2 , v4 } belong to the different sides of the partition and so there exists\nan edge v1 \u2212\u2212 v4 in G, contradicting (10) being a restriction. Therefore G can have no\nrestriction of the form (10) either.\n(iv) \u21d2 (i). Suppose that c-rk G \u2265 3. After reordering, Ac has a submatrix of the form\ni1\ni2\ni3\n\n1\n?\n?\nj1\n\n0\n1\n?\nj2\n\n0\n0\n1\nj3\n\n0\n?\n?\nj1\n\n1\n0\n?\nj2\n\n1\n1\n0\nj3\n\nand so A has a submatrix of the form\ni1\ni2\ni3\n\nThen j2 \u2212\u2212 i1 \u2212\u2212 j3 is a subgraph with 3 distinct vertices. We may assume that the\ntriangle K3 is not a restriction of G. Since i2 \u2212\u2212 j3 is an edge, it follows that i2 6= j2 .\nHence\nj2 \u2212\u2212 i1 \u2212\u2212 j3 \u2212\u2212 i2\n(11)\nis a subgraph of G with 4 distinct vertices. Since there is no edge i2 \u2212\u2212 j2 and K3 is not a\nrestriction of G, then (11) is a restriction of G and so (iv) fails as required. \u0003\nProposition 4.3 Let G be a finite graph. Then the following conditions are equivalent:\n(i) c-rk G \u2265 4;\n15\n\n\f(ii) G has a subgraph\nv1\n\nv2\n\nv4\n\nv3\n\nwith St(v1 ) 6= St(v3 ) and St(v2 ) 6= St(v4 ).\nProof. Write G = (V, E).\n(i) \u21d2 (ii). Suppose that c-rk G \u2265 4. After reordering, A has a submatrix of the form\ni1\ni2\ni3\ni4\n\n0\n?\n?\n?\nj1\n\n1\n0\n?\n?\nj2\n\n1\n1\n0\n?\nj3\n\n1\n1\n1\n0\nj4\n\nThen we have edges\ni1\n\nj3\n\nj4\n\ni2\n\nin G. Since i3 \u2208 St(j4 )\\St(j3 ) and j2 \u2208 St(i1 )\\St(i2 ), the vertices i1 , i2 , j3 , j4 are all distinct\nand (ii) holds.\n(ii) \u21d2 (i). If (ii) holds, then we may assume out of symmetry that there exist some\nw \u2208 St(v1 ) \\ St(v3 ) and z \u2208 St(v2 ) \\ St(v4 ). Consider the chain\nV \u2283 St(v1 ) \u2283 St(v1 , v3 ) \u2283 St(v1 , v3 , z) \u2283 \u2205\n(taking respectively v1 , w, v4 , v2 to show that the inclusions are strict). Thus c-rk G \u2265 4. \u0003\nNow Propositions 4.2 and 4.3 combined provide a characterization of c-rank 3.\nProposition 4.4 Let G be a finite graph. Then the following conditions are equivalent:\n(i) c-rk G \u2265 5;\n(ii) G has a subgraph\nv1\nv2\n\nv3\n\nv4\n\nv5\nwith St(v1 ) 6= St(v5 ), St(v2 ) 6= St(v3 ) and St(v2 ) \u2229 St(v3 ) 6\u2286 St(v4 ).\n\n16\n\n\fProof. Write G = (V, E).\n(i) \u21d2 (ii). Suppose that c-rk G \u2265 5. After reordering, A has a submatrix of the form\ni1\ni2\ni3\ni4\ni5\n\n0\n?\n?\n?\n?\nj1\n\n1\n0\n?\n?\n?\nj2\n\n1\n1\n0\n?\n?\nj3\n\n1\n1\n1\n0\n?\nj4\n\n1\n1\n1\n1\n0\nj5\n\nThen\ni1\n\nj3\n\nj4\n\nj5\n\ni2\nis a subgraph of G with 5 distinct vertices. Now j2 \u2208 St(i1 ) \\ St(i2 ), i4 \u2208 St(j5 ) \\ St(j4 ) and\ni3 \u2208 (St(j4 ) \u2229 St(j5 )) \\ St(j3 ) and so (ii) holds.\n(ii) \u21d2 (i). If (ii) holds, then we may assume out of symmetry that there exist some\nw1 \u2208 St(v1 ) \\ St(v5 ), w2 \u2208 St(v2 ) \\ St(v3 ) and w3 \u2208 (St(v2 ) \u2229 St(v3 )) \\ St(v4 ). Consider the\nchain\nV \u2283 St(v1 ) \u2283 St(v1 , v5 ) \u2283 St(v1 , v5 , w3 ) \u2283 St(v1 , v5 , w3 , w2 ) \u2283 \u2205\n(taking respectively v1 , w1 , v4 , v3 , v2 to show that the inclusions are strict). Thus c-rk G \u2265 5.\n\u0003\nNow Propositions 4.3 and 4.4 combined provide a characterization of c-rank 4.\nWe can now use the previous results to give a complete characterization of sober connected graphs with low c-rank (in view of (iv), see [4]):\nCorollary 4.5 Let G = (V, E) be a finite sober connected graph. Then:\n(i) c-rk G = 0 if and only if G is the empty graph;\n(ii) c-rk G = 1 if and only if G \u223c\n= K1 ;\n(iii) c-rk G = 2 if and only if G \u223c\n= K2 ;\n(iv) c-rk G = 3 if and only if |E| \u2265 2 and G has no squares;\n(v) c-rk G = 4 if and only if G has a square but no subgraph\nv1\nv2\n\nv3\nv5\n17\n\nv4\n\n\fwith St(v2 ) \u2229 St(v3 ) 6\u2286 St(v4 ).\n(vi) c-rk G \u2265 5 if and only if G has a subgraph of the above form.\nProof. (i) and (ii) follow immediately from Proposition 4.1. Since Since sober connected\nnontrivial complete bipartite graphs can have only one edge, (iii) follows from Proposition\n4.2.\nNow part (iii) implies that c-rk G \u2265 3 if and only if |E| \u2265 2, and so (iv) follows from\nProposition 4.3.\nFinally, Propositions 4.3 and 4.4 yield (v) and (vi). \u0003\n\n5\n\nThe c-independent subsets in c-rank 3\n\nWe shall denote by SCn the class of all finite sober connected graphs of c-rank n. Throughout this section, all graphs are in SC3. In view of Corollary 4.5(iv), these graphs have no\nsquares (for such graphs with few vertices, see [4]).\nThe following lemma collects some elementary facts involving this class of graphs. We\nrecall that a graph is called cubic if all vertices have degree 3.\nLemma 5.1 Let G be a finite connected graph.\n(i) If G is cubic and gth G \u2265 5, then G \u2208 SC 3.\n(ii) If G = (V, E) \u2208 SC 3, then |St(v) \u2229 St(w)| \u2264 1 holds for all distinct vertices v, w of\nG.\nProof. (i) If G is non sober, then G would contain a square, contradicting gth G \u2265 5.\nHence G is sober. The claim now follows from Corollary 4.5.\n(ii) Suppose that |St(v, w)| > 1 for distinct vertices v, w of G = (V, E). Since G is sober,\nwe may assume that St(v, w) \u2282 St(v). Let a, b \u2208 St(v, w) be distinct. Since G is sober, we\nmay assume that there exists some c \u2208 St(b) \\ St(a). Hence\nSt(v) \u2283 St(v, w) \u2283 St(v, w, c) \u2283 St(v, w, c, a)\nis a chain in Fl G, contradicting c-rk G = 3. \u0003\nBy c-rank, the c-independent subsets of a graph G = (V, E) in SC3 can have at most\n3 elements. However, as it will become clear soon enough, the c-independent subsets of V\ndo not constitute a matroid. Our first result associates a matroid to G: we define Mat G to\ncontain:\n\u2022 all the i-subsets of V for i \u2264 2;\n\u2022 all the 3-subsets W of V such that\n\u2200v \u2208 V W 6\u2286 St(v).\nNote that the latter condition is equivalent to St(W ) = \u2205.\nProposition 5.2 Let G \u2208 SC 3. Then Mat G is a matroid.\n18\n\n\fProof. Let I, J \u2208 Mat G. Without loss of generality, we may assume that |I| = 3 and\n|J| = 2. Write I = {i1 , i2 , i3 } and J = {j1 , j2 }. Suppose that {j1 , j2 , ik } \u2208\n/ Mat G for\nk = 1, 2, 3. Then there exists some vk \u2208 St(j1 , j2 , ik ) \u2286 St(j1 , j2 ). By Lemma 5.1(ii), we get\nv1 = v2 = v3 and so I \u2286 St(v1 ), contradicting I \u2208 Mat G. Therefore {j1 , j2 , ik } \u2208 Mat G for\nsome k \u2208 3\u0302 and so Mat G is a matroid. \u0003\nWe identify next the c-independent subsets of vertices for graphs in SC3. We say that\na 3-subset P \u2286 V is a potential line if |P \u2229 St(v)| \u2264 1 for every v \u2208 V .\nTheorem 5.3 Let G = (V, E) be a graph in SC 3 and let W \u2286 V . Then the following\nconditions are equivalent:\n(i) W is c-independent;\n(ii) |W | \u2264 2 or\n|W | = 3, St(W ) = \u2205 and W is not a potential line.\nProof. Since G is sober, and by Remark 3.2, W is c-independent if |W | \u2264 2. On the other\nhand, since c-rk G = 3, then V has no c-independent 4-subsets. Therefore we may assume\nthat |W | = 3. Write W = {w1 , w2 , w3 }.\nAssume that W is independent. By Theorem 3.1, we may assume that\nV \u2283 St(w1 ) \u2283 St(w1 , w2 ) \u2283 St(w1 , w2 , w3 )\n\n(12)\n\nis a chain in Fl G. Since St(w1 , w2 , w3 ) 6= \u2205 would allow us to adjoin the empty set to the\nchain and contradict c-rank 3, then St(W ) = \u2205. On the other hand, for v \u2208 St(w1 , w2 ), we\nget |W \u2229 St(v)| \u2265 2 and so W is not a potential line either.\nConversely, assume that St(W ) = \u2205 and W is not a potential line. Then |W \u2229 St(v)| \u2265 2\nfor some in v \u2208 V . We may assume that w1 , w2 \u2208 St(v). Furthermore, since G is sober, we\nmay also assume that St(w1 ) \u2283 St(w1 , w2 ). (12) is a chain in Fl G and so W is independent\nby Theorem 3.1. \u0003\nNow Proposition 5.2 and Theorem 5.3 yield:\nCorollary 5.4 Let G = (V, E) be a graph in SC 3. If G has no potential lines, then the set\nof all c-independent subsets of V constitutes a matroid.\nIn view of this result, it is only natural to enquire which graphs in the above class have\nno potential lines. It turns out that diameter makes the difference:\nProposition 5.5 Let G be a graph in SC 3.\n(i) If diam G < 3, then G has no potential lines.\n(ii) If diam G > 5, then G has potential lines.\n(iii) If diam G \u2208 {3, 4, 5}, then both cases may occur.\nProof. (i) First, we note that if P \u2286 V is a potential line and p, q \u2208 P are distinct, then\nd(p, q) 6= 2 (if p \u2212\u2212 v \u2212\u2212 q is a path in G, then |P \u2229 St(v)| \u2265 2), and if d(p, q) = 1, then the\nedge p \u2212\u2212 q can lie in no triangle. Hence, if diam G < 3 and P = {p1 , p2 , p3 } is a potential\n19\n\n\fline, then d(p1 , p2 ) = d(p1 , p3 ) = d(p2 , p3 ) = 1 immediately gets us into a contradiction.\nThus (i) holds.\n(ii) Assume that diam G > 5. Then G has a geodesic (path of minimum length connecting the extreme vertices) of length 6, say\nv0 \u2212\u2212 v1 \u2212\u2212 v2 \u2212\u2212 v3 \u2212\u2212 v4 \u2212\u2212 v5 \u2212\u2212 v6\nSince d(v0 , v3 ) = d(v3 , v6 ) = 3, it follows that {v0 , v3 , v6 } is a potential line of G.\n(iii) It is enough to show that there exist in SC3 a graph G3 with diameter 3 and\npotential lines, and a graph G5 with diameter 5 and no potential lines.\nWe can take G3 to be the cubic graph\n\u25e6\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u25e6\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u25e6\n\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\nSince gth G = 5, it follows from Lemma 5.1(ii) that G \u2208 SC3. Straightforward checking\nshows that diam G = 3 and G has potential lines such as the one defined by the hollow\ncircles.\nOn the other hand, we can take G5 to be the graph\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\nIt follows easily from Corollary 4.5(iv) that G \u2208 SC3, and it is immediate that diam G = 5.\nSuppose that G has a potential line P . Then at least two points of P would have to fit into\na subgraph of the form\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\nleading at once to a contradiction. Therefore G has no potential lines as claimed. \u0003\n\n20\n\n\fExample 5.6 Let G = (V, E) be the graph\n1\n\n4\n3\n\n5\n\n2\n\n7\n\n6\n\n(see [4]). By Corollary 4.5(iv), we have G \u2208 SC3. The lattice of flats of G can be depicted\nas\nV\n\n456\n\u000f |\n\n4\n\ns\n\n234\n\"\n\n5\n\n|\n\nu\n\n125\n)\n\n6\n\n|\n\n|\n\n\u000f\n\n!\n\n136\n\")\n\n}\n\n2\n\n(\n\n!+\n\n27\n3\n\n}\n\n*\n\n(*\n\n37\n1\n\n}\n\n17\n!( \u000f\n\n7\n\n\"(+ \u000f }tv\n\u2205\n\nIt is straightforward to check that G has no potential lines and Mat G contains all the\ni-subsets of V for i \u2264 3 except the flats 125, 136, 234 and 456. In view of Theorem 5.3,\nthese are precisely the c-independent subsets of V . See further remarks after Corollary 6.6\nrelating to the Fano plane.\nIf we restrict our attention to cubic graphs, the range is a bit reduced. A list of all cubic\ngraphs up to 12 vertices can be found in [27], where the handy LCF notation is explained\nand used.\nCorollary 5.7 Let G be a cubic graph in SC 3.\n(i) If diam < 3, then G has no potential lines.\n(ii) If diam G > 3, then G has potential lines.\n(iii) If diam G = 3, then both cases may occur.\nProof. (i) By Proposition 5.5(i).\n(ii) Suppose now that diam G > 3. Let a, b \u2208 V be such that d(a, b) = 4, and write\nSt(a) = {x, y, z}. Clearly, b is at distance \u2265 3 from x, y or z. To prevent {a, b, x} from\nbeing a potential line, a \u2212\u2212 x must lie in some triangle. If we try to avoid other potential\nlines, also a \u2212\u2212 y and a \u2212\u2212 z must lie in triangles. Now it is easy to see that at least two\nof the vertices x, y, z must be connected through edges. Without loss of generality, we may\nassume that\na\nx\n\ny\n21\n\nz\n\n\fis a subgraph of G. But then we have a square in a sober graph, contradicting c-rank 3 in\nview of Corollary 4.5(iv). Thus (ii) holds.\n(iii) The example G3 in the proof of Proposition 5.5(iii) is cubic, belongs to SC3, has\ndiameter 3 and has potential lines.\nHowever, the Heawood graph [24] is cubic, bipartite, has diameter 3 and girth 6 (and so\nis in SC3, see Proposition 7.1(iii) in next section). Suppose that P = {a, b, c} is a potential\nline of the Heawood graph. Then the distance between any two distinct vertices in P cannot\nbe 2, and so must be 1 or 3 in view of the diameter being 3. Thus we obtain a cycle of\nodd length in the graph, contradicting the fact of being bipartite. Therefore the Heawood\ngraph has no potential lines. \u0003\n\n6\n\nThe Levi graph and partial euclidean geometries\n\nGiven a finite graph G = (V, E) we can consider V as \"points\" and E as \"lines\", where v\nis on e (v \u2208 e) if and only if e is incident to v, and so (V, E) gives some sort of geometry\n(see [3, 5]). So the Levi viewpoint for \"lines\" in a graph is different from our view of taking\nSt(v) as lines. I this section, we benefit from this other approach and introduce right away\nthe concept of partial euclidean geometry.\nLet P be a finite nonempty set and let L be a nonempty subset of 2P . We shall always\nassume that P \u2229 2P = \u2205. We say that (P, L) is a partial euclidean geometry (abbreviated\nto PEG) if the following axioms are satisfied:\n(G1) P \u2286 \u222aL;\n(G2) if L, L0 \u2208 L are distinct, then |L \u2229 L0 | \u2264 1;\n(G3) |L| \u2265 2 for every L \u2208 L.\nThe elements of P are called points and the elements of L are called lines. Given p \u2208 P , we\ndenote by L(p) the set of all lines containing p.\nThe concept of PEG is an abstract combinatorial generalization of the following geometric situation:\nConsider a finite set of lines L in the euclidean space Rn . Consider also a finite subset\nP of \u222aL \u2282 Rn such that:\n\u2022 if L, L0 \u2208 L are distinct, then |L \u2229 L0 | \u2264 1;\n\u2022 if L, L0 \u2208 L and L \u2229 L0 = {p}, then p \u2208 P ;\n\u2022 |L \u2229 P | \u2265 2 for every L \u2208 L.\nRepresenting each L \u2208 L by L \u2229 P , it follows that (L, P ) constitutes a PEG. It is well\nknown that not all PEG's can be represented over an euclidean space (nor any field) (see\n[9, Section 2.6]).\nUsing Coxeter's notation (see [5]), we say that the PEG (P, L) is an (mc , nd ) configuration if:\n\u2022 there are m points and n lines;\n22\n\n\f\u2022 each point belongs to c lines;\n\u2022 each line contains d points.\nHence cm = dn, which equals the number of 1's in the (boolean) incidence matrix of (P, L),\nwhere rows are labelled by points and columns by lines.\nAn important example is provided by the famous Desargues configuration. A simple way\nof defining it is by taking points as 2-subsets of 5\u0302 and lines as 3-subsets of 5\u0302 (identifying\n{a, b, c} with {{a, b}, {a, c}, {b, c}}). For a geometric representation, see e.g. [22]. It is\nclear that the Desargues configuration is a (103 , 103 ) configuration. It has many interesting\nproperties, such as being self-dual (by exchanging points and lines, we get an isomorphic\nconfiguration), and the automorphism group acts transitively on both vertices and edges.\nAnd it is of course related to the famous Desargues' Theorem [22]. Notice that, for every\npoint p, there are exactly 3 points noncolinear with p (i.e., not belonging to some line\nsimultaneously with p), and that these 3 points constitute a line!\nNow, for every G = (V, E) \u2208 SC3, let\nLG = {W \u2208 Fl G \\ {V } : |W | \u2265 2}\nand let Geo G = (V, LG ).\nProposition 6.1 If G \u2208 SC3, then Geo G is a PEG.\nProof. Let v \u2208 V . Since c-rk G = 3, then St(v) 6= \u2205. If all the elements of St(v) have degree\n1, then G sober implies that v has also degree 1 and so G \u223c\n= K2 , contradicting Corollary\n4.5(iv). Hence there exists some w \u2208 St(v) with degree \u2265 2 and so v \u2208 St(w) \u2208 LG . Thus\nGeo G satisfies axiom (G1) (and also LG 6= \u2205).\nFinally, (G2) follows from Lemma 5.1(ii) and (G3) holds trivially. Therefore Geo G is a\nPEG. \u0003\nNote that Mat G consists of all subsets of V with at most 2 elements plus all 3-subsets\nwhich are contained in no line of Geo G.\nCorollary 6.2 If G \u2208 SC3 is cubic with n vertices, then Geo G is an (n3 , n3 ) configuration.\nProof. Indeed, in this case the lines are of the form St(v), for any v \u2208 V . \u0003\nExample 6.3 If G is the Petersen graph, then Geo G is the Desargues configuration.\nIndeed, let G = (V, E) denote the Petersen graph, where the vertices are described as the\n\n23\n\n\f2-subsets (written in the form ij) of 5\u0302 and ij \u2212\u2212 kl is an edge if and only if {i, j}\u2229{k, l} = \u2205:\n45\n23\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n25\n\n34\n\n35\n\n15\n\n24\n\nSince the graph has girth 5, it follows easily that Geo G = (V, L) for L = {St(v) | v \u2208 V },\nwhich coincides precisely with our previous description of the Desargues configuration.\nWe say that a PEG G = (P, L) is connected if there is no nontrivial partition L = L1 \u222aL2\nsuch that (\u222aL1 ) \u2229 (\u222aL2 ) = \u2205. Note that this is equivalent to the usual geometric concept\nof connectedness if our PEG has an euclidean geometric realization through real lines and\nreal points.\nProposition 6.4 Let G be a graph in SC3 with mindeg G \u2265 2. Then the following conditions are equivalent:\n(i) Geo G is connected;\n(ii) G is not bipartite.\nProof. By definition, Geo G is disconnected if and only if there exists a nontrivial partition\nLG = L1 \u222a L2 such that (\u222aL1 ) \u2229 (\u222aL2 ) = \u2205. In view of Proposition 6.1 and (G1), this\nsupposes a nontrivial partition V = V1 \u222a V2 with \u222aL1 = V1 and \u222aL2 = V2 .\nIf G is bipartite with respect to a partition V = V1 \u222a V2 , then we take\nL1 = {St(v) | v \u2208 V2 },\n\nL2 = {St(v) | v \u2208 V1 }.\n\nSince mindeg G \u2265 2, and by Proposition 6.1, this shows that Geo G is disconnected.\nConversely, assume that Geo G is disconnected. Hence there exists a nontrivial partition\nV = V1 \u222a V2 with \u222aL1 = V1 and \u222aL2 = V2 . Suppose that St(v) \u2286 V1 for some v \u2208 V1 .\nSince G is connected, it follows easily from an induction argument that St(w) \u2286 V1 for any\nw \u2208 V1 , contradicting V2 6= \u2205. Hence St(v) \u2286 V2 for every v \u2208 V1 . By symmetry, we also\nhave St(v) \u2286 V1 for every v \u2208 V2 . Therefore G is bipartite. \u0003\nAs we mentioned in the beginning of the section, we can view graphs as a particular\ncase of PEG's, when we assume lines to have exactly two points. Note that the concept\n24\n\n\fof connectedness for PEG's coincides with the usual concept of connectedness for graphs\nwhen we view graphs as PEG's.\nGiven a PEG G = (P, L), we define the Levi graph of G [5] by Levi G = (P \u222a L, E), where\nE consists of the edges of the form p \u2212\u2212 L, for all L \u2208 L and p \u2208 L.\nViewing K3 as a PEG, we have\n1\n\n2\n\n{1, 2}\n\n{1, 3}\n\n{2, 3}\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n3\n\nK3\n\nLevi K3\n\nIf G is a graph, its Levi graph is in fact a subdivision of G. A simple way of picturing\nit is by introducing a new vertex at the midpoint of every edge (breaking thus the original\nedge into two). Obviously, the new vertices represent the edges where they originated.\nAmong configurations, famous examples include the Desargues graph [21] as the Levi\ngraph of the Desargues configuration and the Heawood graph [24] as the Levi graph of the\nFano plane [23].\nThe following results collects some elementary properties of the Levi graph of a PEG\n(configuration) (see [3, 5]). Proofs are immediate.\nProposition 6.5 Let G = (P, L) be a PEG. Then:\n(i) Levi G is bipartite with respect to the partition P \u222a L;\n(ii) the degree of p \u2208 P in Levi G is the number of lines containing p;\n(iii) the degree of L \u2208 L in Levi G is |L|;\nP\n(iv) Levi G has |P | + |L| vertices and\n\np\u2208P\n\n|L(p)| +\n2\n\nP\n\nL\u2208L |L|\n\nedges.\n\nWe define mindeg G to be mindeg Levi G.\nCorollary 6.6 Let G = (P, L) be an (mc , nd ) configuration. Then Levi G has m+n vertices\nand cm = dn edges.\nIn particular, the Levi graph of the Desargues configuration, which is a (103 , 103 ) configuration, has 20 vertices and 30 edges.\nGoing back to the graph in Example 5.6, it is easy to check that Geo G has V = 7\u0302 as\nset of points and lines St(v) for v \u2208 V . The following picture shows that Geo G is somehow\n\n25\n\n\fpart of the Fano plane [23]:\n1\n7\n3\n\n2\n\n4\n5\n\n6\nMoreover, Levi Geo G can be obtained as follows: we make the Hasse diagram of Fl G into\na graph (the Hasse graph of Fl G) by taking as vertices all flats, and letting x \u2192 y be\nan edge whenever x covers y in Fl G or vice-versa; removing the vertices V and \u2205, we get\nthe restricted Hasse graph of Fl G, which is then isomorphic to Levi Geo G. This is just a\nparticular case of Proposition 6.12.\nWe discuss next girth and connectedness.\nProposition 6.7 Let G = (P, L) be a PEG. Then\n(i) gth Levi G \u2265 6 and is not odd;\n(ii) Levi G is connected if and only if G is connected.\nProof. (i) Since Levi G is bipartite by Proposition 6.5(i), it has no cycles of odd length.\nTherefore it is enough to exclude existence of squares in Levi G. Suppose that\np\n\nL\n\nL0\n\np0\n\nis a square in Levi G. Then |L \u2229 L0 | \u2265 2, contradicting (G2). Therefore gth Levi G \u2265 6.\n(ii) Suppose that G is not connected. Then there is a nontrivial partition L = L1 \u222a L2\nsuch that (\u222aL1 ) \u2229 (\u222aL2 ) = \u2205. Suppose that L \u2212\u2212 p \u2212\u2212 L0 is a path in Levi G. Since\np \u2208 L \u2229 L0 and (\u222aL1 ) \u2229 (\u222aL2 ) = \u2205, then L and L0 must belong to the same side of the\npartition. Hence the connected component of a line in Levi G does not contain the lines in\nthe other side of the partition, and so Levi G is not connected.\nConversely, suppose that Levi G is not connected. Let L1 be the set of all lines in a\nfixed connected component of Levi G and let L2 = L \\ L1 . Suppose that p \u2208 (\u222aL1 ) \u2229 (\u222aL2 ).\nThen there exist L1 \u2208 L1 and L2 \u2208 L2 such that p \u2208 L1 \u2229 L2 . Hence we have a path\nL1 \u2212\u2212 p \u2212\u2212 L2 in Levi G and so L1 and L2 belong to the same connected component, a\ncontradiction. Thus (\u222aL1 ) \u2229 (\u222aL2 ) = \u2205 and so G is not connected. \u0003\n26\n\n\fNote that, if G is a graph, the cycles of Levi G are of the form\nv0 \u2212\u2212 {v0 , v1 } \u2212\u2212 v1 \u2212\u2212 {v1 , v2 } \u2212\u2212 . . . \u2212\u2212 {vn , v0 } \u2212\u2212 v0 ,\nwhenever\nv0 \u2212\u2212 v1 \u2212\u2212 . . . \u2212\u2212 vn \u2212\u2212 v0\nis a cycle in G. Thus\ngth Levi G = 2gth G.\nProposition 6.8 The following conditions are equivalent for a PEG G = (P, L):\n(i) Levi G is sober;\n(ii) the mapping P \u2192 2L : p 7\u2192 L(p) is one-to-one;\n(iii) for all distinct points p, p0 \u2208 P , there exists some line L \u2208 L containing just one of\nthem.\nProof. We start by computing the stars of Levi G. For p \u2208 P and L \u2208 L, we have St(p) =\nL(p) and St(L) = L (recall that L is a set of points!). By axioms (G1) and (G3), we have\nrepectively St(p) 6= \u2205 and St(L) 6= \u2205. Since P \u2229 L = \u2205, we must have always St(p) 6= St(L).\nOn the other hand, the restriction St|L is always one-to-one, hence Levi G is sober if and\nonly if St|P is one-to-one, which is equivalent to (ii). The equivalence of (ii) and (iii) is\ntrivial. \u0003\nIf G is a graph, the above conditions are equivalent to saying that no union of connected\ncomponents of G has exactly two vertices.\nWe call a PEG satisfying the conditions of Proposition 6.8 sober. In view of axiom (G2),\nwe immediately obtain:\nCorollary 6.9 If G is a PEG and mindeg G \u2265 2, then G is sober. In particular, if G is an\n(mc , nd ) configuration with c \u2265 2, then G is sober.\nThis provides us with infinitely many examples of graphs in SC3 with girth \u2265 6:\nCorollary 6.10 Let G be a PEG.\n(i) If G is sober and connected, then Levi G \u2208 SC3.\n(ii) If mindeg G \u2265 2, then mindeg Levi G \u2265 2.\nProof. (i) Since G is sober, so is Levi G. By Proposition 6.7, Levi G is connected and has\ngirth \u2265 6. Thus Levi G has c-rank 3 by Corollary 4.5(iv).\n(ii) By Proposition 6.5, in view of mindeg G \u2265 2 and (G3). \u0003\nNote that, given a non bipartite cubic graph C in SC3 with n vertices (so n \u2265 10), it\nfollows from Proposition 6.4 and Corollaries 6.2 and 6.9 that Geo C is a sober connected\n(n3 , n3 ) configuration. Hence, by Proposition 6.5 and Corollary 6.10, Levi Geo C is now a\nbipartite cubic graph in SC3, so one can generate cubics this way. This does not iterate\nbecause Geo Levi Geo C does not stay connected.\n27\n\n\fGiven a graph G = (V, E), we say that the vertex v \u2208 V is closed if {v} = St(W ) for some\nW \u2286 V , i.e. {v} \u2208 Fl G. Note that this is also equivalent to the equality {v} = St(St(v)),\nsince St(v) is clearly the greatest subset W of V such that v \u2208 St(W ). We say that G is\nclosed if all its vertices are closed.\nBy taking G to be the graph 1 \u2212\u2212 2 \u2212\u2212 3 \u2212\u2212 4, and omitting brackets/commas in the\nrepresentation of the flats, we can see that Fl G = {1234, 13, 24, 2, 3, \u2205} and so 2 and 3 are\nclosed while 1 and 4 are not.\nWe can now prove the following (see [4] in view of (ii)):\nLemma 6.11 Let G = (V, E) be a finite graph satisfying one of the following two conditions:\n(i) G is sober and cubic;\n(ii) mindeg G \u2265 2 and G has no squares.\nThen G is closed.\nProof. Let v \u2208 V . Clearly, v \u2208 St(St(v)). Suppose that v 6= w \u2208 St(St(v)). Then\nSt(v) \u2286 St(w).\nIf G is cubic, this implies St(v) = St(w) and G would not be sober. Therefore (i) implies\n{v} = St(St(v)).\nOn the other hand, if (ii) holds, then by taking distinct a, b \u2208 St(v) we would get a\nsquare\nv\na\nb\n\nw\n\na contradiction. Therefore we also get {v} = St(St(v)) in this case. \u0003\nWe can now prove the following result:\nProposition 6.12 Let G \u2208 SC3 have mindeg G \u2265 2. Then Levi Geo G is isomorphic to\nthe restricted Hasse graph of Fl G.\nProof. Write G = (V, E). By Proposition 6.1, we have Geo G = (V, {St(v) | v \u2208 V }) and\nso the vertex set of Levi Geo G is V \u222a {St(v) | v \u2208 V }. On the other hand, by Lemmas\n5.1(ii) and 6.11(ii), the restricted Hasse graph G0 of Fl G has\n{{v} | v \u2208 V } \u222a {St(v) | v \u2208 V }\nas vertex set, yielding an obvious bijection to the vertex set of Levi Geo G.\nNow the edges of Levi Geo G are of the form w \u2212\u2212 St(v) whenever w \u2208 St(v) (v \u2208 V ),\nand this is equivalent to say that St(v) covers {w} in Fl G. Therefore the two graphs are\nisomorphic. \u0003\nWe proceed now to analyse the lattice of flats of the Levi graph of a connected PEG\nwith mindeg \u2265 2.\nTheorem 6.13 Let G = (P, L) be a PEG and let Levi G = (P \u222a L, E). If G is connected\nand mindeg G \u2265 2, then:\n28\n\n\f(i) Levi G is closed;\n(ii) Flats Levi G = {P \u222a L, \u2205} \u222a {{x} | x \u2208 P \u222a L} \u222a {L | L \u2208 L} \u222a {Lp | p \u2208 P };\n(iii) Flats Levi G satisfies the Jordan-Dedekind condition.\nProof. (i) By Lemma 6.11 and Proposition 6.7(i).\n(ii) Given p \u2208 P and L \u2208 L, we have St(p) = L(p) and St(L) = L. Moreover, St(p, L) =\n\u2205. Now, given p0 \u2208 P \\ {p}, we have St(p, p0 ) = {L} if p, p0 \u2208 L \u2208 L (note that L is\nthen unique by (G3)), otherwise empty. Finally, if L0 \u2208 L \\ {L}, we have in view of (G2)\nSt(L, L0 ) = {p} if L \u2229 L0 = {p}, otherwise empty. Note that we get all {L} by (G3) and\n(G2), and we get all {p} by (G1) and (G2). This proves (ii).\n(iii) Since mindeg G \u2265 2, it follows easily from parts (i) and (ii) that the maximal chains\nof Fl Levi G are all of the form\n\u2205 \u2282 {p} \u2282 L \u2282 P \u222a L\nor\n\u2205 \u2282 {L} \u2282 L(p) \u2282 P \u222a L\nfor some p \u2208 L \u2208 L. Therefore all maximal chains have length 3. \u0003\nWe can now compute the c-independent subsets of Levi G for this same class of PEG's:\nCorollary 6.14 Let G = (P, L) be a PEG and let Levi G = (P \u222a L, E). If G is sober\nconnected and mindeg G \u2265 2, then W \u2286 P \u222a L is c-independent if and only if it satisfies\none of the following conditions:\n(i) |W | \u2264 2;\n(ii) |W | = 3 and |W \u2229 L| = 2 for some L \u2208 L;\n(iii) |W | = 3 and |W \u2229 L(p)| = 2 for some p \u2208 P .\nProof. By Theorems 5.3 and 6.13, W is c-independent if and only if |W | \u2264 2 or\n|W | = 3, St(W ) = \u2205 and W is not a potential line.\n\n(13)\n\nThus we only need to show that the join of conditions (ii) and (iii) is equivalent to (13).\nAssume |W | = 3. It is easy to see that St(W ) 6= \u2205 can only occur if W \u2286 L for some\nL \u2208 L or W \u2286 L(p) for some p \u2208 P . On the other hand, if W is not a potential line, then\n|W \u2229 St(x)| \u2265 2 for some x \u2208 P \u222a L, that is, either |W \u2229 L| \u2265 2 or |W \u2229 L(p)| \u2265 2 for some\np \u2208 P , L \u2208 L. Since |W | = 3, the result follows. \u0003\nGoing back to the K3 example at the beginning of this section, it is now easy to check\nthat every 3-subset W of V \u222a E is c-independent in Levi K3 \u223c\n= C6 . Indeed, since |Ev | = 2\nfor every v \u2208 V , we only need to show that there exist necessarily some w1 , w2 \u2208 W at\ndistance 2 (in Levi K3 ). This is certainly true for C6 , hence the c-independent subsets of\nvertices of Levi K3 (and therefore of C6 !) are all the subsets with at most 3 vertices.\nAnother example is given by the Fano plane [23]. We have remarked before that the\nHeawood graph H is isomorphic to the Levi graph of the Fano plane and has no potential\n29\n\n\flines. It follows from Theorem 5.3 that the c-independent subsets of H = (V, E) are all\nsubsets with at most 3 vertices except the flats St(v) (v \u2208 V ). The reader can now check\nthat these 463 subsets correspond to the ones given by Corollary 6.14.\nGiven a PEG G = (P, L), and since L \u2286 2P , we can consider the lattice Lb defined in\nSubsection 2.2. We denote it by Lat G.\nLemma 6.15 Given PEG's G and G 0 with mindeg \u2265 2, the following conditions are equivalent:\n(i) G \u223c\n= G0;\n(ii) Lat G \u223c\n= Lat G 0 .\nProof. It is immediate that the structure of G determines the structure of Lat G, up to\nisomorphism. Conversely, we can recover the structure of G from Lat G:\nIndeed, in view of (G2) and mindeg G \u2265 2, we have\nLat G = {P, \u2205} \u222a L \u222a P\n\n(14)\n\nand so we can identify the points in P with the atoms of Lat G and the lines in L with the\nmaximal elements of Lat G \\ {P }. Moreover p \u2208 L if and only if the corresponding atom of\nLat G is below the element representing in L, hence Lat G determines the structure of G up\nto isomorphism and the lemma follows. \u0003\nIf mindeg G \u2265 2, we can also introduce the dual PEG G d (see [5]):\nLemma 6.16 Let G = (P, L) be a PEG with mindeg G \u2265 2. Then G d = (L, {L(p) | p \u2208 P })\nis also a PEG with mindeg G d \u2265 2. Moreover, Levi G \u223c\n= Levi G d .\nProof. We have L \u2286 \u222ap\u2208P L(p) since G satisfies (G3). Hence G d satisfies (G1). Given\ndistinct p, p0 \u2208 P , we have |L(p) \u2229 L(p0 )| \u2264 1 since G satisfies (G2). Hence also G d satisfies\n(G2). Since mindeg G \u2265 2 implies that |L(p)| \u2265 2 for every p \u2208 P , then G d satisfies (G3)\nand is thus a PEG.\nNext, since G satisfies (G3), every L \u2208 L belongs at least to two L(p) and so mindeg G d \u2265\n2.\nFinally, let \u03b8 : P \u222a L \u2192 L \u222a {L(p) | p \u2208 P } be the bijection defined by p\u03b8 = L(p) (p \u2208 P )\nand L\u03b8 = L (L \u2208 L). It is immediate that \u03b8 preserves the edges, thus Levi G \u223c\n= Levi G d . \u0003\nLet (X1 , \u22641 ) and (X2 , \u22642 ) be lattices. We denote the maximum (respectively the minimum) of both lattices by 1 (respectively 0) and assume the remaining elements to be\ndisjoint. The coproduct of (X1 , \u22641 ) and (X2 , \u22642 ), denoted by (X1 , \u22641 ) t (X2 , \u22642 ), has elements X1 \u222a X2 (identifying the two 0's and the two 1's) and partial order \u22641 \u222a \u22642 . In\nparticular, x1 \u2227 x2 = 0, x1 \u2228 x2 = 1 for all x1 \u2208 X1 and x2 \u2208 X2 .\nTheorem 6.17 Let G be a PEG with mindeg G \u2265 2. Then Fl Levi G \u223c\n= Lat G t Lat G d .\nMoreover, this is the unique coproduct decomposition of Fl Levi G.\nProof. Write G = (P, L). The isomorphism Fl Levi G \u223c\n= Lat G t Lat G d follows easily from\nTheorem 6.13 and (14).\nSuppose now that \u03c6 : Fl Levi G \u2192 X1 t X2 is a lattice isomorphism for some nontrivial\nlattices X1 , X2 . Let Yi denote the atoms of Fl Levi G belonging to Xi \u03c6\u22121 (i = 1, 2). Suppose\n30\n\n\fthat {p} \u2208 Y1 with p \u2208 P . If p \u2212\u2212 L \u2212\u2212 p0 is a path in Levi G, then it follows from (G2)\nthat {p} \u2228 {p0 } = L < P \u222a L and so {p0 } \u2208 Y1 . Since G is connected, it follows that {q} \u2208 Y1\nfor every q \u2208 P . Since X2 is nontrivial, then {L} \u2208 Y2 for some L \u2208 L. If L \u2212\u2212 q \u2212\u2212 L0 is a\npath in Levi G, then it follows from (G2) that {L} \u2228 {L0 } \u2286 L(q) < P \u222a L and so {L0 } \u2208 Y2 .\nSince G is connected, it follows that {M } \u2208 Y2 for every M \u2208 L. Since the atoms determine\nthe coproduct decomposition, it follows that X1 \u223c\n= Lat G d . \u0003\n= Lat G and X2 \u223c\nNow we can prove the following:\nTheorem 6.18 Let G and G 0 be PEG's with mindeg G, mindeg G 0 \u2265 2. Then the following\nconditions are equivalent:\n(i) G \u223c\n= G 0 or G d \u223c\n= G0;\n(ii) Levi G \u223c\n= Levi G 0 ;\n(iii) Fl Levi G \u223c\n= Fl Levi G 0 .\nProof. (i) \u21d2 (ii). In view of Lemma 6.16.\n(ii) \u21d2 (iii). Immediate.\n(iii) \u21d2 (i). Write G = (P, L) and G 0 = (P 0 , L0 ). Assume that Fl Levi G \u223c\n= Fl Levi G 0 .\nBy Theorem 6.17, we have Lat (G 0 ) \u223c\n= Lat (G) or Lat (G 0 ) \u223c\n= Lat (G d ). Now (i) follows from\nLemma 6.15. \u0003\nThe graph version is slightly simpler:\nCorollary 6.19 Let G and G0 be finite connected graphs with mindeg G, mindeg G0 \u2265 2.\nThen the following conditions are equivalent:\n(i) G \u223c\n= G0 ;\n(ii) Levi G \u223c\n= Levi G0 ;\n(iii) Fl Levi G \u223c\n= Fl Levi G0 .\nProof. Viewing a graph G as a PEG, its dual Gd is a graph if and only if each vertex of\nG has degree 2, implying G to be a cycle and therefore self-dual. Now we apply Theorem\n6.18. \u0003\nHowever, we recall that Fl G \u223c\n= Fl G0 does not imply G \u223c\n= G0 , even when mindeg G, mindeg G0 \u2265\n2 (see the example following the proof of Proposition 3.8).\n\n7\n\nCubic graphs\n\nWe present in this section some specific results concerning cubic graphs.\nWe start by some easy remarks concerning girth and c-rank of cubic graphs. For instance,\nnote that gth G < \u221e for every finite cubic graph: any acyclic graph contains necessarily\nvertices of degree 1.\nIn view of Propositions 3.4 and 4.1, we have 2 \u2264 c-rk G \u2264 4 for every cubic graph G.\nHowever, the following result shows that c-rank and girth are not independent for cubic\ngraphs:\n31\n\n\fProposition 7.1 Let G = (V, E) be a cubic graph.\n(i) If gth G = 3, then c-rk G = 3 or 4.\n(ii) If gth G = 4, then c-rk G = 2 or 3 or 4.\n(iii) If gth G \u2265 5, then G is sober, c-rk G = 3 and |St(v, w)| \u2264 1 for distinct v, w \u2208 V .\nMoreover, all these combinations with girth \u2264 8 can occur. If G is sober and connected,\nonly the cases with gth G = 4 and c-rk G < 4 are excluded.\nProof. (i) By Proposition 4.2, since G has a triangle.\n(ii) By the comment preceding the proposition.\n(iii) On the other hand, Since gth G \u2265 5, G has a restriction of the form\n\u2022 \u2212\u2212 \u2022 \u2212\u2212 \u2022 \u2212\u2212 \u2022\nand so c-rk G > 2 by Proposition 4.2. On the other hand, if c-rk G = 4, then G would have\na square by Proposition 4.3, a contradiction. Therefore c-rk G = 3. Since G has no squares,\nthe remaining conditions follow as well.\nWe present next examples to show that all these combinations with girth \u2264 8 occur:\n\u2022 c-rank 2, girth 4: the complete bipartite graph K3,3 ;\n\u2022 c-rank 3, girth 3:\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022 c-rank 3, girth 4:\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022 c-rank 3, girth 5: the Petersen graph\n\u2022 c-rank 3, girth 6: the Heawood graph [24];\n32\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\n\f\u2022 c-rank 3, girth 7: the McGee graph [25];\n\u2022 c-rank 3, girth 8: the Tutte-Coxeter graph [28];\n\u2022 c-rank 4, girth 3: the complete graph K4 ;\n\u2022 c-rank 4, girth 4:\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\nNote that all these examples are sober and connected except those with gth G = 4 and\nc-rk G < 4. The reason for the exclusion of these combinations lies within Corollary 4.5: if\nG is sober and c-rk G < 4, then G has no squares. \u0003\nNote that some of the arguments used in this proof are valid also for graphs which are\nnot cubic. For instance, if gth G \u2265 5 and all vertices of G have degree > 1, then G is\nnecessarily sober.\nIt is an interesting problem to determine under which conditions the lattice of flats of a\ngraph has certain properties.\nIn the following theorems, we present results for the case of connected cubic graphs. We\nstart with a couple of useful lemmas.\nLemma 7.2 Let G = (V, E) be a finite nonempty graph. Then:\n(i) every atom of Fl G is of the form St(St(v)) for some v \u2208 V ;\n(ii) the converse is true if G is cubic.\nProof. (i) Let W be an atom of Fl G. We may write W = St(X) for some X \u2286 V . Let\nv \u2208 W = St(X). Then X \u2286 St(v) and so St(St(v)) \u2286 St(X) = W . Since v \u2208 St(St(v)) and\nW is an atom, we get St(St(v)) = W .\n(ii) Assume that G is cubic and W = St(St(v)) for some v \u2208 V . Let u \u2208 V be such that\nW \u2229 St(u) 6= \u2205. We must prove that W \u2286 St(u).\nIndeed, if x \u2208 W \u2229 St(u) = St(St(v)) \u2229 St(u), then St(v) \u222a {u} \u2286 St(x). Since |St(v)| =\n|St(x)| = 3, it follows that u \u2208 St(v) and so W = St(St(v)) \u2286 St(u) as required. \u0003\nLemma 7.3 Let G = (V, E) be a finite connected cubic graph. Then the following conditions are equivalent:\n(i) St(v) is an atom of Fl G for some v \u2208 V ;\n(ii) G \u223c\n= K3,3 .\n33\n\n\fProof. (i) \u21d2 (ii). If St(v) is an atom of Fl G, then, for every u \u2208 V , either St(v) \u2286 St(u)\nor St(v) \u2229 St(u) = \u2205. Since G is cubic, St(v) \u2286 St(u) is actually equivalent to St(v) = St(u).\nWriting St(v) = {a, b, c} and St(a) = {v, x, y}, we can take u above equal to x and y to\nobtain St(x) = St(y) = St(v) = {a, b, c}. It follows that G has a subgraph of the form\nx\n\ny\n\nz\n\na\n\nb\n\nc\n\n(note that {x, y, z} \u2229 {a, b, c} = \u2205 due to the absence of loops). Since G is cubic and\nconnected, this must be the whole of G, which is then isomorphic to K3,3 .\n(ii) \u21d2 (i). Since the lattice of flats of K3,3 is isomorphic to (22\u0302 , \u2286). \u0003\nTheorem 7.4 Let G = (V, E) be a finite connected cubic graph. Then the following conditions are equivalent:\n(i) Fl G is distributive;\n(ii) Fl G is modular;\n(iii) Fl G is semimodular;\n(iv) Fl G is geometric;\n(v) G \u223c\n= K4 or G \u223c\n= K3,3 .\nProof. The implications (i) \u21d2 (ii), (ii) \u21d2 (iii) and (iv) \u21d2 (iii) are immediate. Since the\nlattices of flats of K4 and K3,3 are isomorphic respectively to (24\u0302 , \u2286) and (22\u0302 , \u2286), we get\n(v) \u21d2 (i) and (v) \u21d2 (iv). It remains to be proved that (iii) \u21d2 (v).\nAssume that Fl G is semimodular. Suppose that diam G > 2. Let v, w \u2208 V be such that\nd(v, w) > 2. Write St(w) = {w1 , w2 , w3 }. By Lemma 7.2, St(St(wj )) is an atom of Fl G for\nj = 1, 2, 3. Since diam K3,3 = 2, it follows from Lemma 7.3 that St(v) is not an atom of\nFl G. Write St(v) = {v1 , v2 , v3 }. By Lemma 7.2, St(St(vi )) is an atom of Fl G for i = 1, 2, 3.\nSuppose that\n\u2200i, j \u2208 3\u0302 \u2203zij \u2208 V : vi , wj \u2208 St(zij ).\n(15)\nSince d(v, w) > 2, we must have zij 6= v, w. Hence {zi1 , zi2 , zi3 } \u2286 St(vi ) \\ {v} and so\n|{zi1 , zi2 , zi3 }| \u2264 2 for i = 1, 2, 3.\n\n(16)\n\n|{z1j , z2j , z3j }| \u2264 2 for j = 1, 2, 3.\n\n(17)\n\nSimilarly,\nLet G0 = (V 0 , E 0 ) be the graph such that V 0 = 3\u0302 \u00d7 3\u0302 and (i, j) \u2212\u2212 (i0 , j 0 ) is an edge\nif and only if (i, j) 6= (i0 , j 0 ) and zij = zi0 j 0 . By (16) and (17), G0 has at least 6 edges.\nSince G0 has 9 vertices, there must be a pair of incident edges. Hence there exist distinct\n(i, j), (i0 , j 0 ), (i00 , j 00 ) \u2208 V 0 such that zij = zi0 j 0 = zi00 j 00 . Thus vi , vi0 , vi00 , wj , wj 0 , wj 00 \u2208 St(zij )\nand so\n|{vi , vi0 , vi00 , wj , wj 0 , wj 00 }| \u2264 3.\n34\n\n\fSince {vi , vi0 , vi00 }\u2229{wj , wj 0 , wj 00 } = \u2205 due to d(v, w) > 2, this contradicts (i, j), (i0 , j 0 ), (i00 , j 00 )\nbeing all distinct. Therefore (15) fails and so there exist i, j \u2208 3\u0302 such that St(vi )\u2229St(wj ) = \u2205.\nNow it is easy to check that\nV\nz\n\nSt(v)\n\u001b\n\u000f\n\nSt(St(vi ))\n\nSt(St(wj ))\n$\n\nz\n\n\u2205\n\nis a sublattice of Fl G. On the one hand, we have St(v) \u2229 St(St(wj )) \u2286 St(v) \u2229 St(w) = \u2205\nsince d(v, w) > 2. On the other hand, suppose that St(St(vi )) \u222a St(St(wj )) \u2286 St(z) for some\nz \u2208 V . Then vi , wj \u2208 St(z), contradicting St(vi ) \u2229 St(wj ) = \u2205. This proves that G cannot\nbe semimodular if diam G > 2. Hence diam G \u2264 2.\nSuppose first that G is not sober. Then we have St(a) = {x, y, z} = St(b) for some\ndistinct a, b \u2208 V , and so G has a subgraph of the form\n\nx\n\na\n\nb\n\ny\n\nz\n\n(18)\n\nSupose that there exists an edge connecting two of the vertices x, y, z, say x \u2212\u2212 y. Then G\nhas a subgraph of then form\nb\na\n\nx\n\ny\n\nz\n\nt\n\nand it is now clear that d(t, y) > 2, contradicting diam G \u2264 2. Hence (18) is a restriction of\nG. If there exists some X \u2208 Fl G satisfying {x, y, z} \u2283 X \u2283 \u2205, it is easy to check that\nV\n{\n\n{x, y, z}\n\u0019\n\n\u000f\n\n{a, b}\n\nX\n#\n\n\u2205\n\n35\n\n|\n\n\fwould be a sublattice of Fl G, contradicting semimodularity. Thus {x, y, z} is an atom and\nso G \u223c\n= K3,3 by Lemma 7.3.\nTherefore we may assume that G is sober. Suppose first that there exists some edge\na \u2212\u2212 b which does not lie in any triangle of G. Since G is sober, if follows from Lemma\n6.11(i) that {a} = St(St(a)) and {b} = St(St(b)). Moreover, a \u2208 St(v) for some v \u2208 V . We\nclaim that\nV\n|\n\nSt(v)\n\u000f\n\n\u0017\n\n{a}\n\n{b}\n!\n\n\u2205\n\n~\n\nis a sublattice of Fl G, a contradiction. Indeed, if b \u2208 St(v), then a, b, v would be the vertices\nof a triangle, contradicting our assumption, and no flat can contain a, b simultaneously by\nthe same reason. Hence every edge of G must lie in some triangle.\nNow G must have a subgraph of the form\na\nb\n\nc\n\nd\nSince the edge a \u2212\u2212 c must lie in some triangle, we have an edge c \u2212\u2212 d or an edge b \u2212\u2212 c.\nWithout loss of generality, we may assume that c \u2212\u2212 d is an edge. If we have an edge\nc \u2212\u2212 e with e 6= b, then we have\na\nb\n\nc\n\ne\n\nd\nand so d(b, e) = 3, a contradiction. Hence there is an edge b \u2212\u2212 c as well and so G \u223c\n= K4 .\nTherefore (v) holds. \u0003\nFor every n \u2265 3, we define the cylindrical strip Hn by\nv1\n\nv2\n\n***\n\nvn\n\nv1\n\nw1\n\nw2\n\n***\n\nwn\n\nw1\n\n36\n\n\fand the M\u00f6bius strip H\u0303n by\nv1\n\nv2\n\n***\n\nvn\n\nw1\n\nw1\n\nw2\n\n***\n\nwn\n\nv1\n\nTheorem 7.5 Let G = (V, E) be a finite connected cubic graph. Then the following conditions are equivalent:\n(i) Fl G satisfies the Jordan-Dedekind condition;\n(ii) c-rk G \u2264 3 or (G is sober and every edge of G lies in some square);\n(iii) c-rk G \u2264 3 or G \u223c\n= K4 or G \u223c\n= Hn for some n \u2265 3 or G \u223c\n= H\u0303n for some n \u2265 4.\nProof. (i) \u21d2 (ii). We may assume that c-rk G \u2265 4. Suppose that G is not sober. Then\nthere exist v, w \u2208 V such that St(v) = St(w). By Lemma 7.2, St(St(v)) is an atom of\nFl G. Since v, w \u2208 St(St(v)), it follows that Fl G has an atom with 2 elements. Since any\nX \u2208 Fl G \\ {V } has at most 3 elements, then Fl G has a maximal chain with length \u2264 3.\nSince c-rk G \u2265 4 implies the existence of some maximal chain with length 4, G fails the\nJordan-Dedekind condition.\nHence we may assume also that G is sober. Suppose now that a \u2212\u2212 b is an edge of G.\nWrite St(a) = {b, c, d}. If St(b, c) contains some other element x 6= a, then a \u2212\u2212 b belongs\nto the square\na\nb\nc\n\nx\n\nhence we may assume that St(b, c) = {a} and so {a} is an atom of Fl G. Write St(b) =\n{a, y, z}. If (i) holds, and since c-rk G \u2265 4, the chain \u2205 \u2282 {a} \u2282 {a, y, z} \u2282 V must admit a\nrefinement. We may therefore assume that {a, y} \u2208 Fl G. It follows that {a, y} = St(p, q) for\nsome distinct p, q \u2208 V . Hence p, q \u2208 St(a) = {b, c, d} and so {p, q} \u2229 {c, d} =\n6 \u2205. Assuming\nthat p \u2208 {c, d}, we obtain a 4-cycle\na\nb\n\np\n\ny\n\nand so (ii) holds.\n(ii) \u21d2 (iii). We may assume that c-rk G \u2265 4, G is sober and every edge of G lies in\nsome square. We consider two cases:\nCase I: gth G = 3.\nSuppose first that G has a subgraph G0 the form\na\n\nb\n\nc\n\nd\n37\n\n\fThen the edge a \u2212\u2212 d must be part of a square\na\n\nd\n\nx\n\ny\n\nSince St(a) and St(d) are fully determined, we must have {x, y} = {b, c} and so G has a\nsubgraph isomorphic to K4 . Since G is connected and cubic, then G \u223c\n= K4 .\nHence we may assume that G has no subgraph isomorphic to G0 above. Take a triangle\nin G. Since every edge must belong to a square and we are excuding subgraphs isomorphic\nto G0 , then G must have a subgraph of the form\na\n\nb\n\nd\n\ne\n\nc\n\nThe existence of an edge c \u2212\u2212 a or c \u2212\u2212 d would imply the presence of a subgraph\nisomorphic to G0 , hence we have an edge c \u2212\u2212 f for some new vertex f . Considering a\nsquare\nc\nf\n\nx\n\ny\n\nit follows easily that either x = b and y = a, or x = e and y = d. These cases yield in fact\nisomorphic subgraphs, hence we assume the first to get\nc\n\ne\nb\n\nf\n\na\n\nd\n\nIt is straightforward to check that the only square that can contain the edge c \u2212\u2212 e is\nc\n\ne\n\nf\n\nd\n\nhence G contains a subgraph isomorphic to H3 and is therefore isomorphic to H3 .\nCase II: gth G = 4.\nLet G0 be a subgraph of G of the form\nv1\n\nv2\n\n***\n\nvn\n\nw1\n\nw2\n\n***\n\nwn\n\n38\n\n\fwith n maximum. We claim that n \u2265 4.\nIndeed, suppose first that n = 2. Since G has no triangles, then we have a subgraph\nv1\n\nv2\n\na\n\nw1\n\nw2\n\nb\n\nLet\nv2\n\na\n\nx\n\ny\n\nbe a square containing v2 \u2212\u2212 a. Then either x = v1 or x = w2 . Suppose first that x = v1 .\nIf y = w1 , then St(v2 ) = St(w1 ), contradicting G being sober. On the other hand, if y is\na new vertex c, we get two adjacent squares and contradict the maximality of n. The case\nx = w2 is similar, hence n > 2 in this case.\nSuppose now that n = 3. Since there are no triangles and G is sober, we have a subgraph\nv1\n\nv2\n\nv3\n\na\n\nw1\n\nw2\n\nw3\n\nb\n\nTo avoid contradicting the maximality of n, we cannot accept an edge a \u2212\u2212 b. Considering\nsquares containing the edges v3 \u2212\u2212 a and w3 \u2212\u2212 b, we obtain edges v1 \u2212\u2212 a and w1 \u2212\u2212\nb. Taking an edge a \u2212\u2212 c, where c is necessarily a new vertex, we immediately get a\ncontradiction by trying to fit the new edge into a square. Thus n \u2265 4.\nNow if vn \u2212\u2212 a is an edge, where a is a new vertex, we cannot fit this edge into a\nsquare without compromising the maximality of n, hence we have either edges v1 \u2212\u2212 vn\nand w1 \u2212\u2212 wn (yielding Hn ) or edges v1 \u2212\u2212 wn and w1 \u2212\u2212 vn (yielding H\u0303n ). Therefore\n(iii) holds.\n(iii) \u21d2 (ii). Immediate.\n(ii) \u21d2 (i). The case c-rk G = 2 being trivial, suppose first that c-rk G = 3. Since the\nflats St(v) are the maximal elements of Fl G \\ {V } and no such flat is an atom of Fl G in\nview of Lemma 7.3, it follows that every maximal chain of Fl G must have length 3 and so\nG satisfies the Jordan-Dedekind condition.\nFinally, assume that c-rk G > 3. Let v \u2208 V . By Lemma 6.11(i), {v} is an atom for every\nv \u2208 V . Now, if {a} \u2282 {a, b, c} = St(x) is a chain in Fl G, then we may assume that there\nexists some square\na\nx\n\ny\n\nb\n\nSince G is sober, it follows that St(x, y) = {a, b} and so all maximal chains in Fl G must\nhave length 4. Thus (i) holds. \u0003\n39\n\n\fIt is easy to check that all graphs Hn and H\u0303n are vertex-transitive: for all vertices v and\nw, there exists an automorphism \u03c6 of the graph such that v\u03c6 = w (i.e. all vertices lie in a\nsingle automorphic orbit).\nBy Proposition 3.4 and Corollary 4.5, a finite sober connected cubic graph has c-rank\n4 if and only if it has a square. If it is also vertex-transitive, then every vertex must lie in\nsome square. The next example shows that one cannot replace edge by vertex in condition\n(ii) of Theorem 7.5, even if we require vertex-transitivity:\n1\n3\n\n2\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n15\n\n14\n16\n\nIndeed, this finite sober connected cubic graph has c-rank 4 and is vertex-transitive (hence\nevery vertex lies in some square), and yet it fails the conditions of Theorem 7.5. Note that\nin this case\nV \u2283 St(1) \u2283 St(1, 4) \u2283 St(1, 4, 11) \u2283 \u2205\nand\nV \u2283 St(3) \u2283 St(3, 12) \u2283 \u2205\nare two maximal chains of different length.\n\n8\n\nMinors and cm-rank\n\nRecall that a finite graph G0 is said to be a minor of a finite graph G if G0 can be obtained\n(up to isomorphism) from G by successive application of the following three operations:\n(D1 ) vertex-deletion: we delete a vertex;\n(D2 ) edge-deletion: we delete an edge;\n(C) contraction: we delete an edge v \u2212\u2212 w and identify the vertices v and w.\nIf G0 is a minor of G, we write G0 \u2264m G.\n\n40\n\n\fIt is easy to check that these operators commute with each other in the sense that\nD1 D2 (G) \u2286 (D2 D1 \u222a D1 )(G), D2 D1 (G) \u2286 D1 D2 (G),\nCD1 (G) \u2286 D1 C(G), D1 C(G) \u2286 (CD1 \u222a D12 )(G),\nCD2 (G) \u2286 (D2 C \u222a C)(G), D2 C(G) \u2286 (CD2 \u222a CD22 )(G),\nhence a minor of G can in particular be obtained by applying to G sequences of contractions\nfollowed by edge-deletions followed by vertex-deletions. Clearly, c-rank cannot increase by\nmeans of vertex-deletions since we are bound to get a submatrix of he original one. However,\nthe example following Proposition 3.6 shows that c-rank can increase by means of edgedeletions. The same happens for contractions: taking the very same square as an example,\nwhich has c-rank 2, and performing a contraction, we get K3 which has higher c-rank.\nThus we introduce a second rank function for finite graphs: given a finite connected\ngraph G, let\ncm-rk G = max{c-rk G0 | G0 \u2264m G}.\nSince a minor has at most as many vertices as the original graph, cm-rank is well defined.\nFor every m \u2208 IN, we denote by Gm the class of all finite graphs with cm-rank \u2264 m. Since\nthe minor relation is transitive, Gm is closed for minors. In view of the Robertson-Seymour\nTheorem (see [6]), there exists a finite set of graphs F such that\nG \u2208 Gm \u21d4 \u2200F \u2208 F F 6\u2264m G.\nWe can easily construct the set F of forbidden graphs in our case. For m \u2265 1, let Fm\nconsist of representatives of all isomorphism classes of graphs with at most 2m vertices and\nc-rank m + 1. Let F0 contain a one-vertex graph.\nProposition 8.1 The following conditions are equivalent for every finite graph G and every\nm \u2208 IN:\n(i) G \u2208 Gm ;\n(ii) \u2200F \u2208 Fm F 6\u2264m G.\nProof. The case m = 0 holding trivially, we assume that m \u2265 1.\n(i) \u21d2 (ii). If G has a minor G0 \u223c\n= F \u2208 Fm , then cm-rk G \u2265 c-rk G0 = c-rk F = m + 1\nand so G \u2208\n/ Gm .\n(ii) \u21d2 (i). If G \u2208\n/ Gm , then G has a minor G0 = (V 0 , E 0 ) of c-rank > m. Since a subgraph\nof a minor is itself a minor, we may assume that c-rk G0 = m+1. Hence there exist I, J \u2286 V 0\nsuch that |I| = |J| = m + 1 and AcG0 [I, J] is nonsingular. Write I = {i1 , . . . , im+1 } and\nJ = {j1 , . . . , jm+1 }. Reordering rows and columns if necessary, we may assume that Ac [I, J]\nis of the form (3), for the ordering i1 < . . . < im+1 and j1 < . . . < jm+1 . Replacing j1 by i1\nand im+1 by jm+1 , the resulting matrix is still of the form (3). Let F be the restriction of\nG0 induced by the vertices {i1 , . . . , im , j2 , . . . , jm+1 }. Up to isomorphism, we have F \u2208 Gm .\nSince F \u2264m G0 \u2264m G, (ii) fails as required. \u0003\nNext we initiate a discussion on how the computation of cm-rank relates to the matrix\nrepresentation of graphs. A sequence of contractions on a graph G = (V, E) determines a\npartition P : V = V1 \u222a . . . \u222a Vm corresponding to the subsets of vertices that are eventually\n41\n\n\fidentified into a single one. It is immediate that the restriction of G induced by each Vi\nmust be connected (we call such a partition connected). How do we identify a connected\nrestriction within Ac ? Through the following straightforward observation:\nProposition 8.2 The following conditions are equivalent for a finite graph G = (V, E):\n(i) G is connected;\n(ii) there exists no nontrivial partition V = I \u222a J such that A[I, J] is the null matrix;\n(iii) there exists no nontrivial partition V = I \u222a J such that all the entries in Ac [I, J] are\nequal to 1.\nWhat happens to the adjacency matrix when we perform a sequence of contractions\ninducing the partition P : V = V1 \u222a . . . \u222a Vm ? Let the new graph be G/P = (V /P, E/P ),\nwith V /P = m\u0302, where each vertex i corresponds to the identification of the vertices in Vi .\nIt is straightforward to check that\n\u001a\n0 if i 6= j and 0 occurs in AcG [Vi , Vj ]\nc\nAG/P [i, j] =\n1 otherwise\nIf we follow a sequence of contractions by a sequence of edge-deletions, we are entitled to\nreplace 0s by 1s in the matrix AcG/P . Finally, vertex-deletions correspond to deleting rows\nand columns in this modified matrix, which does not increase c-rank, and can therefore be\nignored in the computation of the cm-rank. We therefore obtain:\nProposition 8.3 Let G = (V, E) be a finite graph. Then cm-rk G is the maximum value\nc\n^\nof rk A\nG/P when P : V = V1 \u222a . . . \u222a Vm is a connected partition of V and\nc\n^\nA\nG/P [i, j]\n\n9\n\n\u001a\n=\n\n0 or 1 if i 6= j and 0 occurs in AcG [Vi , Vj ]\n1\notherwise\n\nThe complement graph\n\nGiven a graph G = (V, E), its complement graph G = (V, G) is the graph defined by the\ncondition\n{v, w} \u2208 E\n\u21d4\n{v, w} \u2208\n/ E},\nfor all distinct v, w \u2208 V .\nThe classical idea of independence for a subset W of vertices of G (no edges between\nthem) is related to our notion of c-independence by W being necessarily c-independent in\nG, but not conversely.\nWe can get a lower bound for c-rk G through the chromatic number. An edge coloring\nof a graph G = (V, E) with c colors is a partition V = V1 \u222a . . . \u222a Vc such that no edge of G\nconnects two vertices in the same Vj . The chromatic number c(G) is the minimum number\nc of colors to edge color G.\nProposition 9.1 Let G be a finite graph. Then c-rk G \u2265\n\n|V |\nc(G) .\n\n|V |\nProof. Since |Vj | \u2265 c(G)\nfor some j, then G has a complete subgraph with at least\nvertices and the claim follows from Proposition 3.6(ii). \u0003\n\n42\n\n|V |\nc(G)\n\n\fAn important issue consists of the study of the sum S = c-rk G + c-rk G for a graph\nwith n vertices. The examples we analyzed so far show that S can be as small as n2 + 2\n(taking G = K n2 , n2 for n even, then G is a disjoint union of two copies of K n2 ) and as large\nas n + 2 (taking G to be a graph of the form\nv1 \u2212\u2212 v2 \u2212\u2212 . . . \u2212\u2212 vn\nfor n \u2265 4). The next result offers an upper bound for S:\nProposition\n\u221a 9.2 Let G = (V, E) be a finite graph with |V | = n. Then S = c-rk G +\nc-rk G < 2n + 1.\nProof. Assume that |E| = k and c-rk G = m. Then m = rk AcG and the witness characterization in Proposition 2.3 yields\n(m \u2212 1) + . . . + 2 + 1 =\n\nm(m \u2212 1)\n\u2264 k.\n2\n\n\u221a\n\nThus 2k \u2265 m2 \u2212 m, yielding m \u2264 1+ 21+8k .\nSimilarly, since G has n(n\u22121)\n\u2212 k edges, we get\n2\nc-rk G \u2264\nHence\n\n\u221a\n\n1+\n\n\u221a\n\n1 + 4n2 \u2212 4n \u2212 8k\n.\n2\n\u221a\n\n1 + 4n2 \u2212 4n \u2212 8k\n.\n2\nA simple calculus exercise shows that a real-valued function of the form\np\n\u221a\n1 + 8x + 1 + 8(a \u2212 x) (a > 0)\nS \u22641+\n\n1 + 8k +\n\nreaches its maximum when x = a2 . Hence\nS \u22641+\n\np\n\u221a\n1 + 2n2 \u2212 2n \u2264 1 + 2n.\n\n\u0003\nWe can also note the following:\nProposition 9.3 Let (Gn )n be a sequence of nonisomorphic finite graphs and let Mn =\nmax{ c-rk Gn , c-rk Gn }. Then\nlim Mn = +\u221e.\nn\u2192+\u221e\n\nProof. Let R(k, k) denote the Ramsey number that ensures every complete graph with at\nleast R(k, k) vertices, with edges colored by two colors, to have a monocromatic complete\nsubgraph with k vertices. Let k \u2208 N. Since the graphs Gn are nonisomorphic, there exists\nsome p \u2208 IN such that all graphs Gn have at least R(k, k) vertices for n > p. In particular,\neither Gn or Gn must contain a complete subgraph with k vertices, and so Mn \u2265 k by\nProposition 3.6(ii). Therefore limn\u2192+\u221e Mn = +\u221e. \u0003\n43\n\n\fWe can give another perpective of the complement graph through the dual lattice of\nclosed stars. Given a graph G = (V, E), the closed star of a vertex v \u2208 V is defined by\nSt(v) = St(v) \u222a {v}.\nGiven S \u2286 2V , it is easy to see that\nSe = {\u222aS | S \u2286 S}\ne and also \u2205 =\nis the \u2228-subsemilattice of (2V , \u2286) generated by S. Note that \u222aS = maxS,\ne\ne\n\u222a\u2205 = minS. Similarly to the dual case, (S, \u2286) is itself a lattice with\nP \u2227 Q = \u222a{X \u2208 S | P \u2229 Q \u2286 X}.\nIn particular, we can take S V = {St(v) | v \u2208 V } and consider the lattice SfV , which we call\nthe dual lattice of closed stars of G.\nTheorem 9.4 Let G = (V, E) be a finite graph. Then c-rk G = ht Sf .\nV\n\nProof. We know that c-rk G is the maximum length n of a chain of the form\nV \u2283 StG (v1 ) \u2283 StG (v1 , v2 ) \u2283 . . . \u2283 StG (v1 , . . . , vn ) = \u2205.\n\n(19)\n\nNow\nStG (v1 , . . . , vi ) = StG (v1 ) \u2229 . . . \u2229 StG (vi ) = (V \\ StG (v1 )) \u2229 . . . \u2229 (V \\ StG (vi ))\nand so\nV \\ StG (v1 , . . . , vi ) = StG (v1 ) \u222a . . . \u222a StG (v1 ).\nPassing (19) to complement, it follows that c-rk G is the maximum length n of a chain of\nthe form\n\u2205 \u2282 StG (v1 ) \u2282 StG (v1 ) \u222a StG (v2 ) \u2282 . . . \u2282 StG (v1 ) \u222a . . . \u222a StG (vn ) = V,\nwhich is precisely ht SfV . \u0003\nAs an example, we can now apply this result to the computation of the c-rank of the\ncomplement of the Petersen graph P :\nExample 9.5 c-rk P = 5.\nWrite P = (V, E), St(v) = StP (v) and St(v) = StP (v). Assume that\n\u2205 \u2282 St(v1 ) \u2282 St(v1 ) \u222a St(v2 ) \u2282 . . . \u2282 St(v1 ) \u222a . . . \u222a St(vn ) = V,\nis a chain of maximum length in SfV . We claim that\n|St(v1 ) \u222a St(v2 ) \u222a St(v3 )| \u2265 8.\n\n(20)\n\nSince P is cubic, it follows from Proposition 7.1(iii) that |St(v1 )\u222aSt(v2 )| \u2265 5. If v1 \u2212\u2212 v2\nis not an edge of P , then |St(v1 ) \u222a St(v2 )| \u2265 7 and so (20) must hold in this case. Hence we\nmay assume that v1 and v2 are adjacent in P . Since P has no triangles, then St(v1 , v2 ) = \u2205\nand so |St(v1 ) \u222a St(v2 )| = |St(v1 ) \u222a St(v2 )| = 6. Suppose that |St(v1 ) \u222a St(v2 ) \u222a St(v3 )| < 8.\nThen |St(v3 ) \u2229 St(vi )| \u2265 2 for some i \u2208 {1, 2}. If vi \u2212\u2212 v3 is an edge, we get a triangle in P ;\nif vi \u2212\u2212 v3 is not an edge, we get a square in P , a contradiction in any case since gth P = 5.\nTherefore (20) holds and so n \u2264 5.\nIt is a simple exercise to produce a chain of length 5 in Sf , hence c-rk P = 5.\nV\n\n44\n\n\f10\n\nOpen questions\n\nHere is a list of open questions, some mentioned in the preceding text:\n1. Characterize those finite graphs G whose lattice of flats are distributive, modular,\nsemimodular, satisfy the Jordan-Dedekind chain condition, or are extremal lattices.\nFor extremal lattices see [14]. The most important questions are for the JordanDedekind chain condition and for the extremal lattices which need not satisfy the\nJordan-Dedekind chain condition. See Theorems 7.4 and 7.5 for some results.\n2. Which hereditary collections have Boolean representations?\nSee Subsection 2.3 and [11] for definitions. All matroids have boolean representations\n(see [12]), but what else? This will be the topic of the future paper [18], which will\nalso carry out a similar analysis like Section 5 but for higher c-rank.\n3. When do two graphs have isomorphic lattices of flats?\n4. Which matroids arise as the c-independent sets of a graph? Prove not all matroids\narise this way.\n5. When is Geo G, for (cubic) G \u2208 SC3 realizable as lines in Euclidean space (i.e. realizable affinely)? Analyse further the map which associates to a non bipartite cubic\nC \u2208 SC3 the bipartite cubic Levi Geo C.\n6. Compare the results of this paper with those of Brijder and Traldi in [2].\n7. Extend the analysis of graphs in this paper to Moore graphs, generalized Petersen\ngraphs, etc. What is Mat M when M is the Moore mystery graph of girth 5 (which\nmay or may not exist) on 57 vertices? See [26].\n8. What is the smallest number of edges we can have in a graph with n vertices to\nmaximize (minimize) c-rk G + c-rk G?\n\nAcknowledgments\nThe second author acknowledges support from the European Regional Development Fund\nthrough the programme COMPETE and by the Portuguese Government through FCT\n(Funda\u00e7\u00e3o para a Ci\u00eancia e a Tecnologia) under the project PEst-C/MAT/UI0144/2011.\n\n45\n\n\fReferences\n[1] A.
