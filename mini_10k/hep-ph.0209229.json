At e+ e\u2212\ncolliders the production of W pairs, single W s, single photons and single Zs is suitable\nfor that. In this paper we consider the process e\u2212 e+ \u2192 W \u2212 W + \u2192 f1 f2 f3 f4 , where\nboth the \u03b3W W and the ZW W couplings can be measured at the scale given by the\nc.m. energy.\nDeviations from the SM at the \u03b3W W and ZW W vertices can be parameterised\nin a general framework. Allowing for complex couplings the most general vertex\nfunctions lead to altogether 28 real parameters [1]. All four LEP collaborations have\ninvestigated TGCs [2], the tightest constraints being of order 0.05 for \u2206g1Z and \u03bb\u03b3 ,\nof order 0.1 for \u2206\u03ba\u03b3 and of order 0.1 to 0.6 for the real and imaginary parts of\nC and/or P violating couplings. All these values correspond to single parameter\nfits. Since only up to three-parameter fits have been performed, only a small subset\nof couplings has been considered at a time, thereby neglecting correlations between\nmost of them. Moreover many couplings, notably the imaginary parts of C and P\nconserving couplings, have been excluded from the analyses.\nAt a future linear e+ e\u2212 collider like TESLA [3] or CLIC [4], respectively covering\na c.m. energy range from about 90 GeV to 800 GeV and from about 500 GeV to\n5 TeV, one will be able to study these couplings with unprecedented accuracy. In\nthis way one may begin to be sensitive to different extensions of the SM, which\npredict deviations at the TGCs from the SM values, typically through the effects of\nnew particles and couplings in radiative corrections. Some examples, where effects of\norder 10\u22123 may occur, are supersymmetric models [5, 6], models containing several\nHiggs doublets [7, 8], E6 vector leptons [9] or Majorana neutrinos [10] and the minimal\n3-3-1 model [11]. For left-right symmetric models [12, 13, 8] and mirror models [13]\nthe effects are predicted to be much smaller, whereas models containing composite\nW bosons [14] or an additional gauge boson Z \u2032 [15] may lead to larger effects.\nGiven the intricacies of a multi-dimensional parameter space, the full covariance\nmatrix for the errors on the couplings should best be studied. The high statistics\nneeded for this will for instance be available at TESLA, where the integrated luminosity is projected to be about 500 fb\u22121 or more per year at 500 GeV which for\nunpolarised beams amounts to about 3.7 million produced W pairs (without cuts).\nFor a run at 800 GeV the luminosity is expected to be twice as high, leading to\n3.9 million W pairs. Moreover, polarised beams will be particularly useful to disentangle different couplings. In fact, certain directions in the parameter space of the\ncouplings, the so called right handed couplings, are difficult to measure in W pair\n3\n\n\fproduction with unpolarised beams [16]. In this case their effects are masked by the\nlarge contribution from the neutrino exchange. With polarised beams the strength of\nthe neutrino exchange contribution can in essence be varied freely.\nIn experimental analyses of TGCs and various other processes, optimal observables [17, 16] have shown to be a useful tool to extract physics parameters from the\nevent distributions. These observables are constructed to have the smallest possible\nstatistical errors. Due to this property they are also a convenient means to determine the theoretically achievable sensitivity in a given process. In addition, they take\nadvantage of the discrete symmetries of the cross section.\nThe method proposed in [18] allows one to simultaneously diagonalise the covariance matrix of the observables and the part of the cross section which is quadratic\nin the couplings. In this way one obtains a set of coupling constants that are naturally normalised for the particular process and-in the limit of small anomalous\ncouplings-can be measured without statistical correlations. This allows one to see\nfor which directions in parameter space the sensitivity to the TGCs is high and for\nwhich it is not, which is hardly possible by looking at covariance matrices of large\ndimension without diagonalisation. Moreover, the total cross section acquires a particularly simple form and provides additional constraints.\nThe basic purpose of this work is to use this extended optimal observable method\nfor a systematic investigation of the prospects to measure the full set of TGCs in\nW pair production at linear collider energies, with special emphasis on initial-state\npolarisation. The usefulness of the method becomes particularly evident when considering imaginary parts of CP conserving TGCs. In this subspace of couplings we find\none direction to which-in the linear approximation and for longitudinally polarised\nbeams-there is no sensitivity in the process we consider. In [18] this was not taken\ninto account and led to numerical instabilities. It is therefore essential to disentangle\nthe measurable TGCs from the hardly measurable one. As a historical motivation one\nmay think of the electromagnetic nucleon form factors F1 and F2 , where the choice of\nlinear combinations GE and GM leads to a simplification of the Rosenbluth formula\nfor the differential cross section of electron-nucleon scattering (see e.g. [19]). Since\nwe deal with 28 couplings here, an appropriate choice of parameters is essential.\nWe restrict ourselves to the semileptonic decays of the W pair, where one W boson decays into a quark-antiquark pair and the other decays leptonically, but leave\naside the decay into \u03c4 \u03bd\u03c4 since these events have a completely different experimental\nsignature. The selected channels have a branching ratio of altogether 8/27, which is\nsix times larger than that of both W s decaying into e\u03bde or \u03bc\u03bd\u03bc . On the other hand,\nthe channels where both W s decay hadronically are difficult to reconstruct [20]. The\nsemileptonic channels have only one ambiguity in the kinematical reconstruction if\nthe charges of the two jets from the hadronically decaying W are not tagged. Then\none cannot associate the jets to the up- and down-type (anti)quark of the W decay,\nand therefore has access only to the sum of the distributions corresponding to the\ntwo final states.\n4\n\n\fThis work is organised as follows: In Sect. 2 we recall the helicity amplitudes and\ncross sections of the process using a spin density matrix formalism. In Sect. 3 the\noptimal-observable method is presented in the form as it is used in our numerical\ncalculations. We explain our technique to implement the simultaneous diagonalisation in a numerically stable way. The role of discrete symmetries in the framework\nof optimal observables is described. Many of the symmetry relations are well known,\nnotably the classification of the TGCs into four symmetry classes [1] and its applicability to the optimal-observable method [16, 18]. Other properties are used for a\ncheck on the numerics. In Sect. 4 the dependence of the sensitivity on longitudinal\nbeam polarisation is illustrated by a simple model. In Sect. 5 we show analytically\nthat one is insensitive to one of the imaginary CP conserving couplings in the case of\nlongitudinal beam polarisation. However, this particular coupling becomes accessible\nwith transverse beam polarisation. In Sect. 6 we present our numerical results, in\nSect. 7 our conclusions.\n\n2\n\nCross Section\n\nFirst we briefly recall the differential cross section of the process\ne\u2212 + e+ \u2192\n\nW\u2212\n+\n\u0592\u2192 f1 + f 2\n\nW+\n\u0592\u2192 f3 + f 4\n\n(1)\n\nfor arbitrary initial beam polarisations, where the final state fermions are leptons or\nquarks.

Note that\nin the narrow-width approximation the intermediate W s are treated as on-shell. We\ndefine the W helicity states which occur on the right hand side of (10) in the frame of\nFig. 1, i.e. we choose the e\u2212 e+ \u2192 W \u2212 W + scattering plane as the x-z-plane and define\n\u0398 to be the polar angle between the W \u2212 and e\u2212 momenta. We choose a fixed direction transverse to the beams in the laboratory. By \u03a6 we denote the azimuthal angle\nbetween this fixed direction and the e\u2212 e+ \u2192 W \u2212 W + scattering plane (see Fig. 2(a)).\nThe respective frames for the decay tensors (11) are defined by a rotation by \u0398 about\nthe y-axis of the frame in Fig. 1 (such that the W \u2212 momentum points in the positive z-direction) and a subsequent rotation-free boost into the c.m. system of the\ncorresponding W . The spherical coordinates are those of the f1 and f4 momentum\ndirections, respectively. In its rest frame, the quantum state of a W boson is determined by its polarisation. For real W s we take as basis the eigenstates of the spin\noperator Sz with the three eigenvalues \u03bb = \u00b11, 0. For off-shell W s a fourth, scalar\npolarisation occurs but is suppressed by mf /mW in the decay amplitude.\nNeglecting the electron mass we have in the SM\nfor \u03c4 = \u03c4 or \u03c4 \u2032 = \u03c4 \u2032 ,\n\nd\u03c3(\u03c4 \u2032 \u03c4 \u2032 )(\u03c4 \u03c4 ) = 0\n\n(12)\n\nwhich we will use in the following (this point is further discussed in Sect. 3.3). At\na linear collider the initial beams are uncorrelated so that their spin density matrix\nfactorises, i.e.\n(13)\n\u03c1(\u03c4 \u03c4 )(\u03c4 \u2032 \u03c4 \u2032 ) = \u03c1\u03c4 \u03c4 \u2032 \u03c1 \u03c4 \u03c4 \u2032 ,\nwhere \u03c1\u03c4 \u03c4 \u2032 and \u03c1\u03c4 \u03c4 \u2032 are the two Hermitian and normalised spin density matrices of\ne\u2212 and e+ respectively.

The\ndegrees Pt\u00b1 of transverse and Pl\u00b1 of longitudinal polarisation obey the relations\n(Pt\u00b1 )2 + (Pl\u00b1 )2 \u2264 1 and Pt\u00b1 \u2265 0. The components of ~p \u00b1 in (15) refer to the frame of\nFig. 1. Note that choosing the same reference frame for ~p \u2212 and p~ + while specifying\neach spinor in its respective helicity basis results in different forms of the density\nmatrices in (14). The relative azimuthal angle \u03c8 = \u03c6\u2212 \u2212 \u03c6+ between p~ \u2212 and p~ + is\nfixed by the experimental conditions, whereas the azimuthal angle \u03c6\u2212 of p~ \u2212 in the\nsystem of Fig. 1 depends on the final state (see Fig. 2(b)). For the case where Pt\u2212 6= 0\nwe choose the transverse part of the vector ~p \u2212 as fixed direction in the laboratory.\nThen we have \u03a6 = \u2212\u03c6\u2212 . Using (5) and (12) to (15), we obtain the differential cross\nsection for arbitrary polarisation:\nd\u03c3|\u03c1\n\n\u001a\n\n1\n=\n(1 + Pl\u2212 )(1 \u2212 Pl+ ) d\u03c3(+\u2212)(+\u2212)\n4\n+ (1 \u2212 Pl\u2212 )(1 + Pl+ ) d\u03c3(\u2212+)(\u2212+)\nh\n\n\u2212 2Pt\u2212 Pt+ Re d\u03c3(+\u2212)(\u2212+) cos (\u03c8 + 2\u03a6)\n+ Im d\u03c3(+\u2212)(\u2212+) sin (\u03c8 + 2\u03a6)\n\ni\u001b\n\n.\n\n(16)\n\nIn the absence of transverse polarisation, (16) is independent of \u03a6 due to rotational\ninvariance.\nIn our analysis we evaluate the matrix elements in (10) at tree level in the SM, replacing the \u03b3W W and ZW W vertices by their most general forms allowed by Lorentz\ninvariance. The corresponding Feynman diagrams are shown in Fig. 3. New physics\nmay also lead to deviations from the SM values at the fermion-boson vertices [21].\nFor these vertices we however retain the SM expressions, following the rationale that\nat present they are confirmed experimentally to a much higher precision than the\ntriple gauge couplings. We remark that there are scenarios of physics beyond the\n8\n\n\fSM where such a treatment is not adequate, since the process e\u2212 e+ \u2192 W \u2212 W + can\nreceive non-standard contributions that cannot be expressed in terms of anomalous\nfermion-boson or three-boson couplings (an example are box graph contributions in\nsupersymmetric theories [5, 22]). Such effects can still be parameterised within a\nmore general form factor ansatz [23]. If they are important, an analysis in terms of\nonly TGCs will not give a correct picture of the underlying physics, but it will still\ncorrectly signal a deviation from the SM. We finally remark that radiative corrections in the SM itself can be included in the analysis procedure we develop here (see\nSect. 3). The purpose of the present study is however to investigate the pattern of\nsensitivity to TGCs and its dependence on beam polarisation, and for this purpose\nit should be sufficient to take the SM prediction at tree level.\nFor the three-boson vertices we use the parameterisation (2.4) in Ref. [1], which\nwe express in terms of the coupling parameters g1V , \u03baV , \u03bbV , g4V , g5V , \u03ba\u0303V and \u03bb\u0303V\n(V = \u03b3, Z) by means of the transformation (2.5) in the same reference. In other words,\nwe understand these parameters as form factors of the three-boson vertices, which\ndepend on the boson virtualities and can take complex values, and not as coupling\nconstants in an effective Lagrangian, which by definition are energy independent and\nreal-valued.\nFor a given e\u2212 beam helicity \u03c4 the process (1) is not sensitive to all couplings, but\nonly to the linear combinations g1L , \u03baL , etc. for left handed (\u03c4 = \u22121) and g1R , \u03baR , etc.\nfor right handed (\u03c4 = 1) electrons, where\ng1L = 4 sin2 \u03b8W g1\u03b3 + (2 \u2212 4 sin2 \u03b8W ) \u03be g1Z ,\ng1R = 4 sin2 \u03b8W g1\u03b3 \u2212 4 sin2 \u03b8W \u03be g1Z ,\n\n(17)\n\nand similarly for the other couplings [1, 16]. Here e denotes the positron charge, \u03b8W\nthe weak mixing angle, and \u03be = s/(s\u2212m2Z ) the ratio of the Z and photon propagators.\nThe parameterisation (17) will in the following be called the L(eft)-R(ight)-basis.\nThe expressions of the amplitudes can be found in [1]. For convenience of the\nreader we rewrite the W \u2212 W + production part in terms of the LR-basis.

Since the\nvector bosons carry spin 1, the TGCs do not contribute to the W W helicity combinations (+\u2212) and (\u2212+). For the other helicity amplitudes, the largest power of \u03b3 in\nthe coefficients A\u03c4\u03bb\u03bb coincides with the number of longitudinal W s. An exception are\nthe couplings \u03bba and \u03bb\u0303a , which correspond to dimension-six operators in the effective\nLagrangian (cf. [1]) and occur with an additional factor of \u03b3 2 . Note that the largest\nkinematical factors in A\u03c4\u03bb\u03bb behave like \u03b3 2 at high energies, in contrast to the basis of\nform factors fi used in Table 4 of [1], where huge factors of \u03b3 4 appear. In the SM at\ntree level one has\ng1V = 1, \u03baV = 1\n(V = \u03b3, Z)\n(21)\nand all other couplings equal to zero. For the anomalous parts of the couplings we\nwrite \u2206g1V = g1V \u2212 1 and \u2206\u03baV = \u03baV \u2212 1 as usual.\nA detailed discussion of the differential cross section is given in [1]. Here we\nonly point out some salient features of the high-energy limit.\n\u221a In Fig. 4 we show the\ntotal cross section for unpolarised beams as \u221a\na function of s. It rises rapidly from\nthreshold up to a maximum of about 20 pb at s \u2248 200 GeV, and in the SM decreases\nfor higher c.m. energies. In the SM each Z-coupling is equal to the corresponding\nphoton coupling. Since \u03be = 1 + O(\u03b3 \u22122) the L-couplings are then of order 1 and the\nR-couplings of order \u03b3 \u22122 . For \u03c4 = +1 this leads to a high energy behaviour of at\nmost M \u223c O(1). For \u03c4 = \u22121 we have g1L = \u03baL = 2\u03be in the SM, and the coefficients\nA\u03bb\u03bb and B\u03bb\u03bb only differ by a factor 2 + O(\u03b3 \u22122 ) according to Table 1. As they occur\nwith different sign in (19) and (20) this again results in a high-energy behaviour\nM \u223c O(1), except for very forward W \u2212 momentum where there is an enhancement\n10\n\n\f1000\n\nSM\n\u0001g1 , g4 , g5 or \u0014~ = 0:1\n\u0001g1Z , g4Z , g5Z or \u0014~Z = 0:1\n\u0001 \u0014 = 0: 1\n\u0001\u0014Z = 0:1\n\u0015 or \u0015~ = 0:1\n\u0015Z or \u0015~ Z = 0:1\n\n100\n\n\u001b [pb\u2104\n\nPSfrag repla ements\n10\n\n1\n\n0:1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\nps [TeV\u2104\n\n4\n\n5\n\nFigure 4: Total cross section with unpolarised beams as a function of the c.m. energy\nin the SM and for one anomalous coupling differing from zero. Some curves coincide\nas explained in the text.\nby the propagator factor (1 + \u03b2 2 \u2212 2\u03b2 cos \u0398)\u22121 . Altogether, these gauge cancellations\npreserve the unitarity of the SM. We also plot in Fig. 4 the total cross section for\none anomalous coupling differing from zero. At high energies each coupling mainly\ncontributes via the W helicity amplitude where it occurs with the highest power\nof \u03b3, i.e. either linearly or quadratically according to Table 1. At sufficiently high\nenergy, the square of an anomalous term dominates over its interference term with\nthe SM amplitude. In the limit \u03b2 \u2192 1 the couplings g1 , g4 , g5 and \u03ba\u0303 enter with\na factor \u03b3, whereas \u03ba, \u03bb, \u03bb\u0303 enter with a factor \u03b3 2 , which explains their different\nbehaviour in Fig. 4. Some couplings have equal coefficients in this limit, which leads\nto a degeneracy of the curves. We also remark that even if more than one anomalous\ncoupling differs from zero, anomalous amplitudes belonging to couplings of different\nC or P eigenvalue do not interfere in the total cross section with unpolarised beams\n(cf. Sect. 3.3).\n\n11\n\n\f3\n\nOptimal Observables\n\nIn this section we discuss how the method of optimal integrated observables is applied\nto our case. In an experiment one measures the differential cross section\nS = d\u03c3|\u03c1 /d\u03c6,\n\n(22)\n\nwhere \u03c6 denotes the set of all measured phase space variables. We distinguish beR\ntween the information from the total cross section \u03c3 = d\u03c3 and from the normalised\ndistribution S/\u03c3 of the events. We first investigate how well TGCs can be extracted\nfrom the latter, and then use \u03c3 to get constraints on those directions in the space of\ncouplings to which the normalised distribution is not sensitive.\nSince S is a polynomial of second order in the anomalous couplings (defined as\nthe couplings minus their tree-level values in the SM) one can write\nS = S0 +\n\nX\n\nS1i hi +\n\nX\n\nS2ij hi hj .\n\n(23)\n\ni,j\n\ni\n\nHere S0 is the tree-level cross section in the SM, and each hi is the real or imaginary\npart of an anomalous TGC. Thus there are 28 real parameters hi altogether. In the\nremainder of this section i and j each run from 1 to 28.\nOne way to extract the coupling constants from the measured distribution (23) is\nto look for a suitable set of observables Oi (\u03c6) whose expectation values\n1\nE[Oi ] =\n\u03c3\n\nZ\n\nd\u03c6SOi\n\n(24)\n\nare sensitive to the dependence of S on the couplings hi . Given the present experimental constraints, we expect these variations to be small. Thus we expand the\nexpectation values to first order in hi :\nE[Oi ] = E0 [Oi ] +\n\nX\n\ncij hj + O(h2 ),\n\n(25)\n\nj\n\nwith\nZ\n\n1\nE0 [Oi ] =\nd\u03c6 S0Oi ,\n\u03c30\nZ\nZ\n\u03c31j\n1\nd\u03c6 Oi S1j \u2212 2 d\u03c6 S0 Oi ,\ncij =\n\u03c30\n\u03c30\n\u03c31j =\n\nZ\n\nd\u03c6 S1j .\n\n(26)\n(27)\n(28)\n\nHere E0 [Oi ] is the expectation value for zero anomalous couplings, whereas cij gives\nthe sensitivity of E[Oi ] to hj . Solving (25) for the set of the hj we get estimators for\nthe anomalous couplings, whose covariance matrix is given by\nV (h) =\n\n1 \u22121\nc V (O) (c\u22121 )T ,\nN\n12\n\n(29)\n\n\fwhere we use matrix notation. Here N is the number of events, and\nV (O)ij =\n\n1 Z\nd\u03c6S0 Oi Oj \u2212 E0 [Oi ]E0 [Oj ] + O(h)\n\u03c30\n\n(30)\n\nis the covariance matrix of the observables, which we have Taylor expanded around\nits value in the SM. As observables we choose\nOi =\n\nS1i (\u03c6)|\u03c1\n.\nS0 (\u03c6)|\u03c1\n\n(31)\n\nFrom (27) and (30) one obtains for this specific choice\nV (O) = c + O(h),\nand therefore\n\n(32)\n\n1 \u22121\nc + O(h).\n(33)\nN\nThe observables (31) are \"optimal\" in the sense that for hi \u2192 0 the errors (33) on\nthe couplings are as small as they can be for a given probability distribution.4 Apart\nfrom being useful for actual experimental analyses, the observables (31) thus provide\ninsight into the sensitivity that is at best attainable by any method, given a certain\nprocess and specified experimental conditions. In the case of one parameter this\ntype of observable was first proposed in [17], the generalisation to several parameters\nwas made in [16]. Moreover, it has been shown that optimal observables are unique\nup to a linear reparameterisation [18]. We further note that phase space cuts, as\nwell as detector efficiency and acceptance have no influence on the observables being\n\"optimal\" in the above sense, since their effects drop out in the ratio (31). This is\nnot the case for detector resolution effects, but the observables (31) are still close\nto optimal if such effects do not significantly distort the differential distributions S1i\nand S0 (or tend to cancel in their ratio). To the extent that they are taken into account\nin the data analysis, none of these experimental effects will bias the estimators.\nIn the present work we use the method of optimal observables in the linear approximation valid for small anomalous couplings. But we emphasise that the method has\nbeen extended to the fully non-linear case where one makes no a priori assumptions\non the size of anomalous couplings in [18]. Such a non-linear analysis for real data\nwas presented in [20] and turned out to be very convenient and highly efficient.\nGiven the projected accuracy at linear colliders, it will in general be necessary\nto take into account radiative corrections to the process e\u2212 e+ \u2192 f1 f2 f3 f4 within the\nSM, which have been worked out in detail in the literature [26]. One possibility to\ninclude them in searches for non-standard TGCs would be to \"deconvolute\" these\ncorrections. For this write the one-loop corrected differential cross section in the SM\nas\nZ\nSSM, corr (\u03c6) = d\u03c6\u2032 S0 (\u03c6\u2032 )F (\u03c6\u2032 , \u03c6),\n(34)\nV (h) =\n\n4\n\nFor details on this so called Rao-Cram\u00e9r-Fr\u00e9chet bound see e.g. [24, 25].\n\n13\n\n\fwhere S0 is the tree-level expression, and the integral kernel can e.g. be obtained\nfrom an event generator by generating events according to both SSM, corr and S0 .\nApproximating the true physical cross section as\nSphys (\u03c6) =\n\nZ\n\nd\u03c6\u2032 S(\u03c6\u2032 )F (\u03c6\u2032, \u03c6),\n\n(35)\n\nwith S given as in (23), one could invert this convolution bin by bin, and then extract\nthe couplings hi from the deconvoluted Born level cross section S as described before.\nThe error made in (35) is that the SM radiative corrections encoded in F do of course\nnot apply to the anomalous part S \u2212 S0 of the cross section, but this error is of order\nhi times the weak coupling constant \u03b1w . Should effects beyond the SM be found\nin such an analysis, one would in a second step have to consider more sophisticated\nmethods to quantitatively disentangle them from SM radiative corrections.\n\n3.1\n\nSimultaneous Diagonalisation\n\nAlthough discrete symmetry properties (see Sect. 3.3) reduce the 28\u00d728 matrices\nV (h), c, etc. to blocks of 8\u00d78 and 6\u00d76 matrices, these blocks still contain many\nnon-negligible off-diagonal entries. To make explicit how sensitive the process is to\neach direction in the space of couplings and to identify the role of polarisation we\nneed to know directions and lengths of the principal axes of the error ellipsoid defined\nby (29), i.e. we have to know the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of V (h). Using optimal\nobservables, to leading order in the hi , the three matrices V (h), c and V (O) are\nautomatically diagonalised simultaneously due to (32) and (33). This means that\nafter such a transformation each observable is sensitive to exactly one coupling, and\nthe observables as well as the estimators of the couplings are statistically independent.\nSince V (h) is symmetric the diagonalisation could be achieved by an orthogonal\ntransformation. Following the proposal of [18] we take however a different choice and\ntransform simultaneously V (h) into diagonal form and the normalised second-order\npart of the total cross section into the unit matrix:\n\u03c3\u03022ij \u2261\n\n1\n\u03c30\n\nZ\n\nd\u03c6 S2ij \u2192 \u03b4ij .\n\n(36)\n\nThis can always be done since \u03c3\u03022 is symmetric and positive definite. We therefore\narrive at the following prescription for the transformation of the couplings (using\nvector and matrix notation):\nh \u2192 h\u2032 = A\u22121 h,\n\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\n(37)\n\nV (h)\u22121 \u2192 V (h\u2032 )\u22121 = AT V (h)\u22121 A = diag (\u03b4h\u20321 )\u22122 , (\u03b4h\u20322 )\u22122 , . . . , (\u03b4h\u203228 )\u22122 , (38)\n\u03c3\u03022 \u2192 \u03c3\u03022\u2032 = AT \u03c3\u03022 A = 1,\n\n(39)\n\nwhere \u03b4h\u2032i are the one-sigma errors on the new couplings. This transformation exists\nand is unique up to permutations and a sign ambiguity for each h\u2032i . Note that the\n14\n\n\fmatrix A is in general not orthogonal. From (23), (31) and (37) the transformation\nof all other quantities follows as\nS1\nO\nc\nV (O)\n\n\u2192\n\u2192\n\u2192\n\u2192\n\nS1\u2032 = AT S1 ,\nO\u2032 = AT O,\nc\u2032 = AT c A,\nV (O\u2032 ) = AT V (O) A.\n\n(40)\n\nThe meaning of (39) is that all quadratic terms contribute to the total cross section\nwith equal strength:\n!\n\u03c3 = \u03c30 1 +\n\nR\n\n8\nX\n\n\u2032 \u2032\n\u03c3\u03021i\nhi +\n\n28\nX\n\n(h\u2032i )2 ,\n\n(41)\n\ni=1\n\ni=1\n\n\u2032\n\u2032\n. Thus the anomalous couplings do not mix in \u03c3 and are\nwhere \u03c3\u03021i\n= \u03c30\u22121 d\u03c6 S1i\n\"naturally\" normalised for the process which we consider. This is not true in the\nconventional basis, where changing different anomalous couplings by the same amount\nhas completely different effects on the total cross section (see Fig. 4 in Sect. 2).\nMoreover, the particularly simple form (41) of \u03c3 easily allows one to use the information from the total rate: it constrains the couplings to lie between two hyperspheres\nin the space of the h\u2032i , whose difference in radius depends on the measurement error\n\u2032\non \u03c3. Making in addition use of the sign ambiguity in (37), one can for all \u03c3\u03021i\n6= 0\n\u2032\n\u2032\nchoose the sign of hi such that \u03c3\u03021i > 0. This choice is however not relevant for the\nanalysis.\nWe finally note that the presented method of simultaneous diagonalisation is quite\nsimilar to the way one analyses the normal modes of a multi-dimensional harmonic\noscillator in classical mechanics [29]. There the harmonic potential (corresponding to\nV ) is diagonalised with respect to the scalar product defined by the kinetic energy\n(corresponding to \u03c3\u03022 ).\n\n3.2\n\nNumerical Realisation\n\nWe now give some details of how the simultaneous diagonalisation can be carried\nout numerically. Although the procedure finally aims at the disentanglement of the\ncouplings as achieved in (38), the numerical computation of V (h) or V (h)\u22121 from (29)\nneeds the inverse of the matrix c or V (O) and might therefore be unstable, because\nbefore the diagonalisation one cannot single out those directions in parameter space\nwhere the errors are large. However, as V (h\u2032 ) and V (O\u2032 ) are simultaneously diagonal\nfor our observables, we can according to (32) equally well compute the diagonal entries\nof\n(42)\nV (O\u2032 ) = c\u2032 = diag(c\u20321 , c\u20322 , . . . , c\u203228 ),\nand extract the errors on the couplings using (33):\n1\n\u03b4h\u2032i = q\n.\nNc\u2032i\n15\n\n(43)\n\n\fHence, using the shorthand notation V = V (O) and V \u2032 = V (O\u2032 ), we have to solve\nthe n2 + n equations\nAT \u03c3\u03022 A = 1,\nAT V A = V \u2032\n\n(44)\n\nfor the n2 entries of A and the n diagonal elements of V \u2032 . Since the multiplication of\nS by a constant changes neither the observables (31) nor V nor \u03c3\u03022 , the matrices A\nand V \u2032 only depend on the normalised distribution of the events but not on the total\nrate N. The latter enters the errors on the transformed couplings only through the\nstatistical factor N \u22121/2 in (43). From (44) it follows that\nV A = \u03c3\u03022 A V \u2032 .\n\n(45)\n\nThis is a generalised eigenvalue problem, with the c\u2032i being the generalised eigenvalues\nand the columns of A being the generalised eigenvectors. The pair (V \u2032 , A) is called\nthe \"eigensystem\" of (44). A standard method for solving (45) is to first perform a\nCholesky decomposition [27, 28]\n\u03c3\u03022 = MM T ,\n\n(46)\n\nwhere M is a lower triangular matrix, i.e. Mij = 0 for j > i. Algorithms for the\ncomputation of M can be found in the same references. Then (45) is equivalent to\nCX = XV \u2032 ,\n\n(47)\n\nC = M \u22121 V (M \u22121 )T ,\nX = M T A.\n\n(48)\n(49)\n\nwhere\n\nEquation (47) denotes a (usual) eigenvalue problem for the matrix C, whose eigenvalues are the same as the original ones and whose eigenvectors are the columns of X.\nSince C is symmetric, (47) can be solved and the eigenvectors are orthogonal with\nrespect to the standard scalar product (assuming non-degeneracy of the eigenvalues).\nRequiring the eigenvectors to be normalised to 1, we have n conditions\nX T X = 1,\n\n(50)\n\nwhich together with the n2 equations (47) are equivalent to (44). The generalised\neigenvectors are obtained by solving (49) for A. The procedure has to be followed for\neach initial state polarisation and c.m. energy separately, leading in general to different eigenvalues and transformation matrices; the dependence of those quantities on\npolarisation is investigated in Sect. 4. In each case we use the procedure iteratively,\n16\n\n\fi.e. once A is obtained, we compute V and \u03c3\u03022 for the transformed observables and couplings, and then diagonalise these-already approximately diagonal-matrices again.\nWe found this to be essential to assure the numerical stability of the results. A stable\nvalue was reached in most cases by the second evaluation and at the latest by the\nfourth. In all cases at least five evaluation steps were carried out. The numbers\npresented in Sect. 6 were obtained by averaging over the results of several subsequent\nsteps where the stable value had already been reached.\nWe note that for situations where \u03c3\u03022 and V have the same block diagonal structure,\nthe diagonalisation can of course be carried out for each block separately. This is\nrelevant in the presence of discrete symmetries.\n\n3.3\n\nDiscrete Symmetries\n\nLet us now discuss the special role of the combined symmetry operations CP and\nCP Te in the context of our reaction [1, 16, 18]. Here C denotes charge conjugation, P\nparity reversal, and Te \"na\u0131\u0308ve time reversal\", i.e. the reversal of all particle momenta\nand spins without the interchange of initial and final state. Under the condition that\nthe initial state, as well as phase space cuts and detector acceptance are invariant\nunder a CP transformation, a CP odd observable gets a nonzero expectation value\nonly if CP is violated in the interaction. Similarly, if the initial state, phase space cuts\nand acceptance are invariant under CP Te followed by a rotation by 180\u25e6 around an\naxis perpendicular to the beam momenta, a nonzero expectation value of a CP Te odd\nobservable implies the interference between absorptive and nonabsorptive amplitudes\nin the cross section. In terms of the three-boson couplings one finds that to O(h)\nthe expectation values of CP even (odd) observables only involve the CP conserving\n(violating) couplings g1 , \u03ba, \u03bb, g5 (g4 , \u03ba\u0303, \u03bb\u0303). Similarly, CP Te even (odd) observables are\nto first order only sensitive to the real (imaginary) parts of the coupling parameters.\nThe coefficient matrix c is thus block diagonal in the following groups of observables:\n(a):\n(b):\n(c):\n(d):\n\nCP\nCP\nCP\nCP\n\nand CP Te even,\neven and CP Te odd,\nodd and CP Te even,\nand CP Te odd.\n\nOne further finds that the first-order terms \u03c31i in the integrated cross section can\nonly be non-zero for couplings of class (a).\nThe above requirements on the initial e+ e\u2212 state are nontrivial in the case of\npolarised beams. Since charge conjugation exchanges e+ and e\u2212 , a CP invariant spin\ndensity matrix requires p~ \u2212 = p~ + , in particular Pt\u2212 = Pt+ and Pl\u2212 = \u2212Pl+ . Under the\nsame conditions the density matrix is also invariant under CP Te times a rotation by\n180\u25e6 around ~k \u00d7~p \u2212 . Let us investigate the situation where these requirements are not\nsatisfied. From Fig. 5 we see that the e+ e\u2212 states where the beam helicities are aligned\nare CP eigenstates. But the antialigned (\u2206\u03c4 = 0) states are interchanged under CP\n17\n\n\fe - \u001b e+\n\n!P\n\ne+ - \u001b e\n\n(\n\n!C\n\ne - \u001b e+\n\ne - \u001b e+\n\n!P\n\ne+ - \u001b e\n\n!C\n\ne - \u001b e+\n\n(\n)\n\n(\n(\n\n(\n(\n\n)\n\n(\n(\n\n(\n)\n\nFigure 5: Effect of a CP transformation on an e+ e\u2212 state with helicities aligned (top)\nor antialigned (bottom).\nand therefore are not eigenstates. On the other hand, the amplitudes for these helicity\ncombinations are proportional to the electron mass in the SM (supplemented by the\nmost general TGCs). They are thus generically suppressed by me /MW compared\nwith the amplitudes for aligned beam helicities (\u2206\u03c4 = \u00b11).5 With transverse beam\npolarisation, the two types of amplitudes can interfere, giving small me /MW effects in\nthe cross section. With purely longitudinally polarised beams they do not interfere, so\nthat effects due to the \u2206\u03c4 = 0 combinations of e+ e\u2212 are of order (me /MW )2 and thus\nbeyond experimental accuracy. We remark that the same holds e.g. in the minimal\nsupersymmetric extension of the SM, where left- and right handed leptons as well as\ntheir superpartners only mix with a strength proportional to the lepton mass. To\ninvestigate what can happen in more generic models is beyond the scope of this work.\nFor general beam polarisation, a nonzero mean value of a CP odd observable can\nbe generated by genuine CP violation in the reaction, or by the CP odd part of the spin\ndensity matrix in the initial state. According to the above estimate, the latter would\nrequire nonstandard physics to be experimentally visible, especially for longitudinal\nbeam polarisation, and thus be interesting in its own right. Similarly, a nonzero result\nfor a CP Te odd observable can originate from absorptive parts in the process, or from\neffects of the amplitudes with zero total helicity of the initial beams. If any such\neffects were observed, one could in a next step investigate their dynamical origin,\nusing their different dependences on the beam polarisation. One possibility is to use\nthat in the absence of \u2206\u03c4 = 0 amplitudes the cross section depends on transverse\nbeam polarisation only via the product Pt\u2212 Pt+ , as seen in (16). If Pt+ = 0, the cross\nsection is then independent of Pt\u2212 and \u03c6\u2212 , whereas the interference between \u2206\u03c4 = 0\nand \u2206\u03c4 = \u00b11 amplitudes leads to terms with Pt\u2212 cos \u03c6\u2212 and Pt\u2212 sin \u03c6\u2212 to the cross\nsection, which can experimentally be identified via their angular dependence on \u03c6\u2212 .\nA possibility to search for the presence of \u2206\u03c4 = 0 amplitudes with only longitudinal\nbeam polarisation will be discussed at the end of Sect. 4.\nReturning to purely longitudinal beam polarisation and the assumption that\n\u2206\u03c4 = 0 amplitudes are negligible, we remark that constraints similar to the ones\n5\nTo be precise, one must exclude final states e+ \u03bde e\u2212 \u03bd\u0304e , where nonresonant graphs contribute in\nwhich the initial e+ and e\u2212 do not annihilate.\n\n18\n\n\fg1 , \u03ba, \u03bb g4 g5 \u03ba\u0303, \u03bb\u0303\nC\nP\nCP\n\nTable 2: Properties of TGCs under\nparity and charge conjugation.\n\n+\n+\n+\n\n\u2212 \u2212\n+ \u2212\n\u2212 +\n\n+\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\ndiscussed above cannot be derived for C and P separately, since neutrino exchange\nmaximally violates both symmetries. One can however classify the TGCs according\nto their C and P behaviour as shown in Table 2. As can be seen from the amplitudes\nin Sect. 2, terms of distinct P or C do not mix in the quadratic part of the total cross\nsection\nZ\n\u03c32ij = d\u03c6 S2ij ,\n(51)\n\nprovided that phase space cuts are separately invariant under P and C. Under the\nsame conditions the linear terms \u03c31i in the integrated cross section for the couplings\ng4R , g5R , \u03ba\u0303R and \u03bb\u0303R vanish. This is due to the absence of the neutrino exchange graph\nfor right handed electrons and the fact that those couplings differ in their P or C\neigenvalues from the TGCs in the SM. Finally, real and imaginary parts of couplings\ndo not mix in \u03c32ij .\nIn the LR-basis, \u03c32ij has an additional block diagonality, with two separate blocks\nfor the R- and the L-couplings, which cannot mix in the total cross section. Any\nblock diagonality of \u03c32ij means that already before the simultaneous diagonalisation\n(40) the subspaces corresponding to these blocks are perpendicular to each other\nP\nwith respect to the scalar product (a, b) = ij ai \u03c3\u03022ij bj . As a consequence, two row\nvectors of A or two column vectors of A\u22121 which correspond to different blocks are\nperpendicular with respect to the standard scalar product. In the case of A\u22121 this\nfollows from the first equation of (44) by solving for \u03c3\u03022 , and in the case of A by\nsolving for \u03c3\u03022\u22121 . The comparison of the matrix products AAT and (A\u22121 )T A\u22121 with\nthis expected orthogonality thus provides a good way to test the numerical results for\nA and A\u22121 . Note however that the transformation described in Sect. 3.1 cannot be\ncarried out on smaller blocks than those given by the four classes (a) to (d) because\nthe left handed couplings mix with the right handed ones in V (O), c and V (h).\n\n4\n\nPolarisation\n\nIn this section we explore how the sensitivity of our process to anomalous TGCs\ndepends on the longitudinal polarisation of the initial beams. To this end we will\nintroduce an appropriate polarisation parameter P and analyse how the eigensystem\ndetermined by (44) depends on it. This may be seen as a preparation for interpreting\nthe numerical results in Sect. 6, which will be given in terms of the same parameter.\nTo start with, we introduce a convenient notation to make explicit the polarisation\n19\n\n\fdependence of the matrices \u03c3\u03022 and V , which have to be diagonalised simultaneously\naccording to (44). In the following we restrict ourselves to the case of longitudinally\npolarised beams. Since in the limit me \u2192 0 only two beam helicity combinations\ncontribute to the amplitudes, we can use (16) to write the differential cross section\nS = d\u03c3|\u03c1/d\u03c6 in terms of the cross sections S L and S R for purely left and right handed\ne\u2212 beams (and opposite e+ helicities),\nS = P LS L + P RS R,\n\n(52)\n\nwhere\n1\n(1 \u2212 P \u2212 )(1 + P + ),\n4\n= d\u03c3(\u2212+)(\u2212+) /d\u03c6,\n\n1\n(1 + P \u2212 )(1 \u2212 P + ),\n4\n= d\u03c3(+\u2212)(+\u2212) /d\u03c6\n\nPL =\n\nPR =\n\n(53)\n\nSL\n\nSR\n\n(54)\n\nand d\u03c6 = d(cos\u0398) d(cos\u03b8) d\u03c6 d(cos\u03b8) d\u03c6. Since we only deal with longitudinal polarisation in this section we drop the subscript 'l' in the polarisation parameters. Note\nthat 0 \u2264 P L , P R \u2264 1. Integrating over d\u03c6 one obtains the total cross section as\n\u03c3 = P L\u03c3L + P R\u03c3R .\n\n(55)\n\nIn the LR-basis we have\nS a = S0a +\n\nX\n\na a\nS1i\nhi +\n\ni\n\n\u03c3 a = \u03c30a +\n\nX\n\nX\n\na\nS2ij\nhai haj ,\n\n(56)\n\na\n\u03c32ij\nhai haj .\n\n(57)\n\ni,j\n\na a\n\u03c31i\nhi +\n\ni\n\nX\ni,j\n\nWe denote again the real or imaginary parts of the anomalous TGCs by hai , but in\ncontrast to (23) we now explicitly write an index a = L, R, so that i and j only run\nfrom 1 to 14. Using vector and matrix notation we can rewrite the total cross section\nas\n\u03c3 = \u03c30 (1 + hT \u03c3\u03021 + hT \u03c3\u03022 h),\n(58)\nwhere\n\u03c30 = P L \u03c30L + P R \u03c30R ,\n!\n\n\u03c3\u03021\n\n1\n=\n\u03c30\n\nP L \u03c31L\nP R \u03c31R\n\n\u03c3\u03022\n\n1\n=\n\u03c30\n\nP L\u03c32\n0\n0\nP R\u03c32\n\n,\n\nh=\n!\n\nhL\nhR\n\n!\n\n,\n\n,\n(59)\n\na\nL\nR\nwith vectors (ha)i = hai and (\u03c31a)i = \u03c31i\nand the matrix (\u03c3 2 )ij = \u03c32ij\n= \u03c32ij\n. In the\nLR-basis and for longitudinal polarisation we thus obtain the following expression for\nthe covariance matrix (30):\n\nVijab\n\na\n\n=P P\n\nb\n\n1\n\u03c30\n\nZ\n\na b\na b\nS1i\nS1j\n\u03c31i\n\u03c31j\nd\u03c6\n\u2212\nS0\n\u03c302\n\n20\n\n!\n\n,\n\n(60)\n\n\fwith a, b = L, R. Let us now investigate in detail how the eigensystem of \u03c3\u03022 and V\ndepends on P L and P R . It is useful to express P L and P R by new variables r and P\n(to be specified below), so that \u03c3\u03022 , V and hence also their eigensystem only depend\non P . For this purpose we introduce P\u0302 L and P\u0302 R through\nP L,R = r P\u0302 L,R(P )\n\n(61)\n\nfor some well-behaved rescaling function r(P L , P R ), and define the \"r-normalised\"\nquantities\n\u03c30r = P\u0302 L \u03c30L + P\u0302 R \u03c30R ,\nS0r = P\u0302 L S0L + P\u0302 R S0R .\n\n(62)\n(63)\n\nWe then have from (59) and (60):\n1\n=\nr\n\u03c30 (P )\n\n\u03c3\u03022\n\nP\u0302 L (P ) \u03c32\n0\nR\n0\nP\u0302 (P ) \u03c32\n\n!\n\n,\n\n(64)\n!\n\na\nb\na b\nS1i\nS1j\n\u03c31i\n\u03c31j\n1 Z\nd\u03c6\n,\n\u2212\n= P\u0302 (P ) P\u0302 (P )\n\u03c30r (P )\nS0r (P ) [ \u03c30r (P )]2\n\nVijab\n\na\n\nb\n\n(65)\n\nwhere we have made the dependence on P explicit. Note that the left hand sides\nof (64) and (65) depend on P but not on r, since \u03c3\u03022 and V do not change when S is\nmultiplied by a constant. For the matrix M in (46) we get\n1\n\nT\n\n\uf8eb q\n\n\uf8ed\nM=q\nr\n\u03c30 (P )\n\n\uf8f6\n\nP\u0302 L M q 0\n\uf8f8,\nR\n0\nP\u0302 M\n\n(66)\n\nwhere \u03c3 2 = M M is the Cholesky decomposition of the P independent submatrix\nof \u03c3\u03022 . Then the result for the transformation (37) is\nh\u2032 = A\u22121 h = X \u22121 M T h\n1\n\nq\n\nP\u0302 L\n\n\uf8eb q\n\n\uf8ed\n= X \u22121 (P ) q\nr\n\u03c30 (P )\nq\n\n\uf8f6\n\nP\u0302 L M q 0\n\uf8f8 h.\nR\n0\nP\u0302 M\n\n(67)\n\nThe factors\nand P\u0302 R in the rightmost matrix determine the mutual normalisation of the blocks of left and right handed couplings. They let A\u22121 become singular\nin the limits P\u0302 L or P\u0302 R \u2192 0. This is not surprising because with beams of purely\nlongitudinal polarisation one is sensitive to only half of the couplings. The coefficient\n(\u03c30r (P ))\u22121/2 in (67)\n\u221a leads to an overall normalisation which strongly depends on the\npolarisation. At s = 500 GeV we have for instance\ntLR \u2261\n\nq\n\n\u03c30L /\u03c30R \u2248 17, \u03c30r \u2248 \u03c30L (P\u0302 L + P\u0302 R /172),\n21\n\n(68)\n\n\f\u221a\nwhereas at s = 3 TeV the ratio tLR is about 30. From (50) we see that the matrix\nX \u22121 is orthogonal for any P . In the case of pure polarisation it is block diagonal\nin the left and right handed couplings. This is however not the case for general\n(longitudinal) polarisation since the diagonalisation cannot be reduced to smaller\nblocks than those given by the four discrete symmetry classes introduced in Sect. 3.3.\nWe now specify the transformation (61) by choosing\nr=\n\n1 \u0010\u221a R \u221a L \u00112\nP + P\n,\n4\n\n(69)\n\nand defining a polarisation parameter\n\u221a\n\u221a\nPR \u2212 PL\n\u221a ,\nP =\u221a\nPR + PL\n\n(70)\n\nwith values \u22121 \u2264 P \u2264 +1. We then have\nP\u0302 R,L = (1 \u00b1 P )2 .\n\n(71)\n\nIn terms of the individual beam polarisations P \u2212 and P + the parameters r and P\nare given as\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\nq\n1\n+ \u2212\n1 \u2212 P P + (1 \u2212 P + P \u2212 )2 \u2212 (P + \u2212 P \u2212 )2 ,\nr =\n8\nP\u2212 \u2212 P+\nq\n.\nP =\n1 \u2212 P + P \u2212 + (1 \u2212 P + P \u2212 )2 \u2212 (P + \u2212 P \u2212 )2\n\n(72)\n(73)\n\nThe reason for this particular choice is as follows. For electron polarisation P0\u2212 and\npositron polarisation P0+ = \u2212P0\u2212 one simply has P = P0\u2212 . For general polarisations\nP is between P \u2212 and \u2212P + , and the differential cross section S for (P \u2212 , P + ) equals\nthe one for (P0\u2212= P, P0+= \u2212P ) up to a constant. The eigenvalues c\u2032i (cf. (42)) are\nhence the same for (P \u2212 , P + ) and for (P0\u2212 , P0+ ).\nTo develop some intuition of how the generalised eigenvalues of (64) and (65) depend on P , we consider the case of only one left and one right handed coupling. Moreover, we neglect the second term in (65), which appears only in symmetry class (a).\nThe matrix \u03c3 2 in (59) then reduces to a single number (\u03c3 2 )11 , the vector (S1 )ai has\nonly one component sa \u2261 (S1 )a1 , and the 2\u00d72 matrices which have to be diagonalised\naccording to (44) can be written as\n\u03c3\u03022\n\n(\u03c3 2 )11\n=\n\u03c30r (P )\n\nP\u0302 L 0\n0 P\u0302 R\n\n!\n\nV\n\n1\n=\nr\n\u03c30 (P )\n\nP\u0302 L 0\n0 P\u0302 R\n\n!\n\n,\n\n22\n\n(74)\nv LL v LR\nv LR v RR\n\n!\n\nP\u0302 L 0\n0 P\u0302 R\n\n!\n\n,\n\n(75)\n\n\fwhere\nv\n\nLL\n\n=\n\nZ\n\n(sL )2\n,\nd\u03c6 r\nS0 (P )\n\nv\n\nLR\n\nZ\n\n=\n\nsL sR\nd\u03c6 r\n,\nS0 (P )\n\nv\n\nRR\n\n=\n\nZ\n\nd\u03c6\n\n(sR )2\n.\nS0r (P )\n\n(76)\n\nAs in (48) we construct a symmetric matrix\nC=\n\n\uf8eb q\n\n1 \uf8ed\n(\u03c3 2 )11\n\nP\u0302 L\n\n0\n\nq\n\n0\n\nP\u0302 R\n\n\uf8f6\uf8eb\n\uf8f8\uf8ed\n\nv\n\nLL\n\nv\n\nLR\n\nv\n\nLR\n\nv\n\nRR\n\n\uf8f6\uf8eb q\n\uf8f8\uf8ed\n\nP\u0302 L\n\nq\n\n0\n\nP\u0302 R\n\n0\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8f8,\n\n(77)\n\nwhose usual eigenvalues are equal to the generalised eigenvalues of V , i.e. to the\ndiagonal entries of the transformed matrix V \u2032 in (44). They are given by\n1\nc\u00b1 =\nP\u0302 L v LL + P\u0302 R v RR \u00b1\n2 (\u03c3 2 )11\n\nr\n\u0010\n\nP\u0302 L v LL\n\n\u2212\n\nP\u0302 R\n\nv RR\n\n\u00112\n\n+\n\n4P\u0302 L P\u0302 R\n\n\u0010\n\nv LR\n\n\u00112\n\n!\n\n. (78)\n\nWe approximate the matrix entries (76) by\nv ab (P ) =\n\n\u1e7d ab\n,\nP\u0302 L \u03c30L + P\u0302 R \u03c30R\n\na, b = L, R,\n\n(79)\n\nwith constants \u1e7d ab , which should take into account their P dependence sufficiently\nwell for a qualitative model. In Fig. 6 we plot the eigenvalues c\u00b1 in arbitrary units\nfor \u03c30L = 1, and \u03c30R = \u03c30L /t2LR = (1/17)2 , with the last number taken from (68).\nThe ratios \u1e7d LL /\u1e7d LR \u2248 \u1e7d LR /\u1e7d RR \u2248 tLR in our choice of parameters are motivated by\nthe power of sL in (76), which corresponds to the power of the neutrino exchange\namplitude in the cross section. One can show analytically that the slopes of the\ncurves for c\u00b1 (P ) tend to zero for P \u2192 \u00b11. For P = 1 this cannot be seen in the\nplot, since for large tLR (i.e. \u03c30L \u226b \u03c30R ) the eigenvalues change rapidly as the e\u2212 beam\nbecomes purely right-handed. To see the horizontal tangent we plot a second example\nin Fig. 7 with a more moderate value of tLR . Notice that for nonzero v LR the two\ncurves for c+ and c\u2212 do not touch. If P\u0302 R or P\u0302 L is zero the matrix \u03c3\u03022 in (74) and\nhence C in (77) is singular, which leads to a zero eigenvalue c\u2212 at P = \u00b11.\nAs in Sect. 3.2 let\n!\nx11 x12\nX = (x\u2212, x+ ) =\n(80)\nx21 x22\nbe the matrix whose columns are the normalised eigenvectors of C. We can see\nfrom Figs. 6 and 7 that for P = \u22121 the vector x+ with large eigenvalue has only an\nupper component (corresponding to hL ), whereas the vector x\u2212 with zero eigenvalue\nhas only a lower component (corresponding to hR ). For P = +1 the situation is\nreversed. This reflects the fact that one is only sensitive to the left handed couplings\nfor P = \u22121 and to the right handed ones for P = +1.

This behaviour of\nA\u22121 has to be taken into account when carrying out the simultaneous diagonalisation\nfor high degrees of longitudinal polarisation, because it leads to a singularity of its\ninverse in the limit P \u2192 \u00b11.\nWe have seen that under the condition that only beam helicity combinations\nwith \u2206\u03c4 = \u00b11 contribute to the cross section, the expectation values of normalised\nobservables only depend on the polarisation parameter P . Such a statement no longer\nholds if beams with helicities coupled to \u2206\u03c4 = 0 contribute as well. This provides a\npossibility to disentangle effects from genuine CP violation or absorptive parts from\nthose due to nonzero \u2206\u03c4 = 0 amplitudes. In particular, the CP odd part of the spin\ndensity matrix for longitudinally polarised e+ e\u2212 beams is proportional to P + + P \u2212\nand will give different contributions to normalised observables if P + + P \u2212 is varied\nfor fixed P .\n\n5\n\nHardly Measurable Couplings\n\nThe particular form of the SM amplitudes for the process e\u2212 e+ \u2192 W \u2212 W + has consequences on its sensitivity to the couplings in the CP conserving sector, which we\nshall now discuss.

Here ha0,i are the SM couplings in the LR-basis\nand Hia = ReHia + i ImHia are the complex anomalous couplings (which we write in\nuppercase to distinguish them from the real-valued parameters hai ).

This direction is determined\n\u2032\nby the real SM couplings as given by (84). Therefore, one of the functions S1i\nand\n\u2032\nthe corresponding observable Oi in (40) are identically zero, and V (O) contains one\n(usual as well as generalised) eigenvalue in symmetry class (b) that is zero for all\nvalues of P . This is confirmed by our numerical results shown in Figs. 10, 14 and 18.\nIn the tables in Sect. 6 the eigenvalues of symmetry class (b), c\u20329 , . . . , c\u203216 , are given in\ndecreasing order. Using this notation we have\n\u2032\nS1,16\n(\u03c6) \u2261 0,\n\nc\u203216 = 0.\n\n(89)\n\nFrom the total rate one can derive constraints on this coupling as explained in Sect. 3.\nNow consider\n!\n!\n\u03c9hR\nRe H R\n0\n=\n,\n(90)\n0\nIm H R\nwhich merely \"stretches\" the right handed SM couplings by a factor (1 + \u03c9). Then\nthe last line of (85) becomes\nR\n(1 + \u03c9)2 hR\n(91)\n0,i h0,j .\nIn the case of purely right handed electrons or left handed positrons, i.e. for P L = 0,\nwe have S \u221d S R from (52), so that the anomalous coupling (90) only increases the\ntotal rate but does not affect the normalised distribution \u03c3 \u22121 S. This holds both to\norder \u03c9 and to order \u03c9 2 . Symmetry class (a) therefore contains a fifth zero eigenvalue\nfor P = +1, in addition to the four zero eigenvalues from the left handed couplings\nRe g1L , Re \u03baL , Re \u03bbL and Re g5L , which cannot be measured for P L = 0. This is again\nconfirmed by our numerical results (cf. Figs. 9, 13, 17). For P L 6= 0, however, S L also\ncontributes to S. Since the functions \u03c3 \u22121 S a are not identical for a = L and a = R, the\nenhancement of S R due to (91) will not just change S by an overall factor, but also\n26\n\n\fmodify the normalised distribution \u03c3 \u22121 S. The latter is sensitive to the anomalous\nTGC in (90) in the linear approximation, since (91) contains a term linear in \u03c9. In\ncontrast to symmetry (b), there is thus no eigenvalue which is identical to zero for all\nvalues of P . Note that S L contains interference terms of the left handed anomalous\namplitudes and the SM neutrino exchange, so that the arguments above do not apply\nto the subspace of the left handed couplings. Also for the symmetries (c) and (d)\nthere is no similar argument because CP violating TGCs are absent in the SM at tree\nlevel.\nThe direction (86) in coupling space becomes measurable in the linear approximation with e+ e\u2212 beams of transverse polarisation.

From (33) and (40) we obtain for the inverse covariance matrix\nof the couplings h\nV (h)\u22121 = N(A\u22121 )T c\u2032 A\u22121 ,\n(95)\nwhere the hi are again 28 real parameters, viz. the real and imaginary parts of g1R ,\ng1L , \u03baR , \u03baL , etc. We number the couplings in the order of their symmetry class (a)\nto (d), and within each symmetry class take the L-couplings first. We then have\nh13 = Im g1R and h14 = Im \u03baR . Note that V (h)\u22121 always exists, even in our case\nwhere one parameter is unmeasurable. In this case V (h)\u22121 is a singular matrix with\na one-dimensional zero eigenspace coming from c\u203216 = 0. Geometrically speaking,\nthe error ellipsoid defined by V (h)\u22121 is degenerate in such a way that the length\nof one principal axis is infinite. Instead of an ellipsoid we have a cylinder whose\naxis corresponds to the direction of the unmeasurable coupling and whose crosssection (orthogonal to the axis) is an ellipsoid giving the errors on the couplings in\nthe orthogonal space. We know from (84) and (86) that the unmeasurable direction\nis given by Im g1R = Im \u03baR 6= 0 with all other couplings being zero. Therefore the\nprojection of the cylinder onto the (Im g1R )-(Im \u03baR )-plane is a band in the Im(g1R +\u03baR )direction, see Fig. 8(a). This shows that we cannot obtain any constraint on Im g1R or\nIm \u03baR unless one of them is known. We can however choose coordinate axes parallel\nand orthogonal to the band shown in Fig. 8(a). In other words, we perform a rotation\nby \u221245\u25e6 in the (Im g1R )-(Im \u03baR )-plane,\nh\u0303 = R h,\n\n28\n\n(96)\n\n\fwhere R is the identity matrix except for the (Im g1R )-(Im \u03baR )-block, which reads\n1\n\u221a\n2\n\n1 \u22121\n1\n1\n\n!\n\n.\n\n(97)\n\n\u221a\nR\n2\nThe new couplings h\u0303i are\nthe\nsame\nas\nthe\nh\n,\nexcept\nfor\nh\u0303\n=\nIm(g\n\u2212\n\u03ba\n)/\ni\n13\nR\n1\n\u221a\nand h\u030314 = Im(g1R + \u03baR )/ 2, which replace Im g1R and Im \u03baR . The inverse covariance\nmatrix of the new couplings is\nV (h\u0303)\u22121 = R V (h)\u22121 RT .\n\n(98)\n\nAll entries in the 14th row and in the 14th column of V (\u221a\nh\u0303)\u22121 are equal to zero: there is\nno correlation between the unmeasurable Im(g1R +\u03baR )/ 2-direction and the couplings\nh\u0303i with i 6= 14. These couplings are hence constrained by a 27-dimensional ellipsoid,\nwhich is drawn schematically in Fig. 8(b) for one further coupling, taken to be Im \u03bbR .\n\u22121\nThis ellipsoid is determined by the \"reduced\" 27 \u00d7 27 matrix Vred\n(h\u0303) obtained from\n\u22121\nV (h\u0303) by deleting the 14th row and\n\u221a the 14th column. Its inverse Vred (h\u0303) is the\nR\ncovariance matrix of Im(g1 \u2212 \u03baR )/ 2 and the other 26 measurable couplings. \u221aIn\nparticular, the width of the band in Fig. 8(a) gives the error on Im(g1R \u2212 \u03baR )/ 2\nin the presence of all other 27 couplings h\u0303i , cf. Fig. 8(b). We finally mention that\nbecause of the discrete symmetries explained in Sect. 3.3, the matrix V (h)\u22121 is block\ndiagonal with one block for each symmetry class (a) to (d), so that the errors on the\ncouplings of class (a), (c) and (d) are entirely unaffected by the previous discussion.\n\n6\n\nNumerical Results\n\nIn this section we present the results for the generalised eigenvalues c\u2032i of the covariance matrix V (O) and the corresponding errors \u03b4h\u2032i = (Nc\u2032i )\u22121/2 on the transformed\ncouplings. The covariance matrix for the couplings in any other parameterisation\nis then obtained by conventional\n\u221a error propagation. We discuss its most important\nproperties in the LR-basis for s = 500 GeV and unpolarised beams in Sect. 6.1. In\nSect. 6.2 we investigate the gain in sensitivity by longitudinal e\u2212 as well as additional\ne+ polarisation. The results for higher c.m. energies are reported in Sect. 6.3. In\nSect. 6.4 we finally give the constraints which can be obtained from the total rate\naccording to (41). Numerical rounding errors on the results presented in this section\nare typically of order 1%.\nWe use mW = 80.42 GeV and mZ = 91.19 GeV from [25], and the definition\n2\nsin \u03b8W = 1 \u2212 m2W /m2Z for the weak mixing angle. For the total event rate N of\nthe semileptonic channels with e and \u03bc summed over we use the values listed in\nTable 3. They correspond to an effective electromagnetic coupling\u221aconstant \u03b1 =\n1/128 and integrated luminosities of 500 fb\u22121 , 1 ab\u22121 and 3 ab\u22121 at s = 500 GeV,\n800 GeV and 3 TeV, respectively. We assume full kinematical reconstruction of the\nfinal state, except that the jet charges are not tagged.

[16]).\n\n6.1\n\nUnpolarised Beams at 500 GeV\n\n\u221a\nWe first consider the sensitivity at s = 500 GeV with unpolarised beams. In Tables 4\u20137 we list the standard-deviation \u03b4hi = [V (h)ii ]1/2 for each coupling hi , which\ngives its error in the presence of all other couplings. Notice the difference of this to\n(Ncii )\u22121/2 , which corresponds to the error on hi when all other couplings are assumed\nto be zero. We also give the correlation matrix\nV (h)ij\nW (h)ij = q\nV (h)ii V (h)jj\n\n(99)\n\nof the couplings for each symmetry class (a) to (d). In the case of symmetry (b) we\nuse the reduced matrix Vred (h\u0303) introduced in Sect. 5. Since W (h) is symmetric we\nonly list its upper triangular part.\nThe values of \u03b4h range from about 5 * 10\u22124 to 10\u22122 within each symmetry class.\nThe smallest are those for \u03bbL , \u03baL and \u03bb\u0303L since at high energies the corresponding\nterms in the helicity amplitudes contain a factor 2\u03b3 2 (cf. Table 1). In all cases the\nerrors on the R-couplings are larger than those on the respective L-couplings, viz. by\na factor 1.5 to 3.4 for Im \u03ba, Re \u2206\u03ba and Re g5 , and by a factor between 4 and 7 for the\nother couplings. This is because (for unpolarised or longitudinally polarised beams)\nthe \u03bd-exchange interferes with the amplitudes containing the hL , but not with those\ncontaining the hR . In general, the sensitivity to the real part of a specific coupling\nis roughly of the same size as the sensitivity to its imaginary part, the errors on the\n30\n\n\flatter being rather larger for CP conserving couplings and smaller for the CP violating\nones. To get an accurate picture of the sensitivities, correlations have to be taken into\naccount. Looking at the 2\u00d72 blocks corresponding to hLi and hR\ni for a given index i,\ni.e. at the diagonal entries of the right upper block in the correlation matrices, we\nsee that the absolute values of the correlations are smaller than about 0.2, except\nfor Re \u2206\u03ba, Im \u03ba and Im g5 , where they are still smaller than 0.6. The corresponding\ncorrelations would be substantial in the basis of the \u03b3- and Z-form factors, which is\nhence not a very suitable parameterisation for the present reaction, compared with\nthe LR-basis (cf. [16]). Considering the matrix blocks of correlations among different\nL-couplings or among different R-couplings, we find that about half of them have an\nabsolute value larger than 0.4. Note that there are correlations of order 0.5 between\ncouplings with different C or P eigenvalues.\nBy simultaneous diagonalisation (see Sect. 3.1) we determine the generalised eigenvalues c\u2032i and corresponding errors \u03b4h\u2032i given in Tables 8 and 9. For symmetry class (b)\nwe give the transformation matrix A and its inverse in Tables 10 and 11.6 In our\nnumerical calculation we find the smallest eigenvalue in symmetry class (b) to be\nc\u203216 \u223c 10\u221214 . We can however use the result of our analytical considerations in Sect. 5\nand set c\u203216 to zero. The same holds for the last column of A except for its Im g1R and Im \u03baR -components, which determine the corresponding \"blind\" direction in the\nLR-basis. As explained in Sect. 3.3 the P odd coupling g5 does not mix with the other\ncouplings in \u03c3\u03022 , and the same is true for the left and right handed couplings. From\nthis block structure of \u03c3\u03022 and the relation \u03c3\u03022 A = (A\u22121 )T it follows that in the last\nrow of A\u22121 we can set all entries to zero, except for the Im g1R -, Im \u03baR - and Im \u03bbR components. Numerically we find that the absolute values of those matrix entries\nwhich we set to zero are smaller than 10\u22128 for A and smaller than 10\u22124 for A\u22121 . We\nremark that we have computed the matrix A\u22121 by inverting A using singular value\ndecomposition [28]. As mentioned at the end of Sect. 3.3 we have as a further check\nevaluated the products AAT and (A\u22121 )T A\u22121 .\n\n6.2\n\nPolarised Beams\n\nAt future e+ e\u2212 -colliders longitudinal polarisation of both initial beams is envisaged [31, 32, 33]. An electron polarisation of P \u2212 = \u00b180% and a positron polarisation\nof P + = \u00b160% is considered to be achievable.\nIn Tables 12 and\u221a13 we give the errors \u03b4h on the real couplings (in the presence\nof all couplings) for s = 500 GeV and various combinations of beam polarisations.\nFor all couplings hL and all couplings hR we find roughly the following gain or loss\nin sensitivity using always the event rates of Table 3. Turning on e\u2212 polarisation of\n\u221280% we gain a factor of 1.4 for hL and loose a factor of 6 for hR . If in addition\n6\n\nThe matrices A\u22121 for symmetry classes (a), (c) and (d) can be obtained from the authors.\nFurther numerical results for unpolarised and longitudinally polarised beams at various c.m. energies\nare given in [30].\n\n31\n\n\fP + = +60% we gain a factor of 1.8 for hL and loose a factor of 17 for hR compared to\nunpolarised beams. For P \u2212 = +80% we loose a factor of 2.6 for hL and gain a factor\nof 3.0 for hR . If furthermore P + = \u221260% we loose a factor of 5 for hL and gain a\nfactor of 5.5 for hR compared to unpolarised beams. Especially for the right handed\ncouplings the gain from having both beams polarised is thus appreciable.\nThe behaviour of the generalised eigenvalues as a function of the parameter P\nintroduced in Sect. 4 is shown in Figs. 9\u201320. Although the four largest eigenvalues\nare more or less constant for P < 0, the transformation matrix A\u22121 is not. This can\nbe seen from Tables 14, 15 and 16. For the largest eigenvalue c\u20321 of symmetry (a) we\nfind that the smaller P is, the more the R-components are suppressed, i.e. the more\none purely measures the hL . Going from P = 0 to P = 1 we become more and more\nsensitive to the hR . For the fourth lowest curve in Fig. 9, corresponding to c\u20325 , as well\nas for the smallest eigenvalue c\u20328 of symmetry (a) we find the opposite tendency. Note\nthat in the case of \u00b1100% electron or positron polarisation we can only be sensitive to\nat most half of the couplings. This is seen for symmetries (c) and (d) in Figs. 11, 12,\n15, 16, 19 and 20: half of the curves go to zero at P = \u00b11. For class (a) (cf. Figs. 9,\n13 and 17) we find one additional eigenvalue going to zero at P = +1 and for class (b)\n(cf. Figs. 10, 14 and 18) there is a zero eigenvalue for all P , as explained in Sect. 5.\nComparing with Fig. 6 we see that for symmetries (b) to (d) the shape of the curves\nis qualitatively well described by the simple model of Sect. 4. Although the lower\nand upper curves for c\u00b1 do not intersect in our examples there, an intersection like in\nFig. 11 is not excluded. In general, it is however not possible to associate a certain\npair of couplings to a pair of curves in Figs. 9\u201320 for the full\n\u221a range of P . This is\nparticularly obvious from the eigenvalues of symmetry (c) at s = 3 TeV (Fig. 19),\nwhere some curves alternately play the role of the lower-type and upper-type curves\nin the simplified model. Moreover, for symmetry class (a) the description of the shape\nof the eigenvalue curves is less obvious due to the second term in the brackets of (60).\n\n6.3\n\nEnergy Dependence\n\nThe gain in sensitivity when going up from 500 GeV to 800 GeV-using always the\nevent rates of Table 3-lies between 1.4 and 2.7 for all couplings except for Im \u03baR ,\nwhere it is 3.6. At 3 TeV we gain a factor of about 25 compared to 800 GeV for this\ncoupling, and of 1.5 to 8 for all others. For symmetries (a) and (c) we give \u03b4h in\nTables 17 and 18.\nNote that this gain is not due to the the total rate, which actually decreases with\nenergy (cf. Table 3). The largest gains are achieved for \u03ba, \u03bb and \u03bb\u0303, which have a\nprefactor 2\u03b3 2 in the amplitude. We remark that both for real and imaginary parts\nthe gains in sensitivity for an L-coupling and the corresponding R-coupling are of the\nsame size, except for Im \u03baR . Furthermore, except for \u2206\u03baL , g4L , g4R and \u03ba\u0303R , the gain\nis slightly larger for the imaginary than for the real parts. For the real parts of the\ncouplings we also give the errors on the transformed couplings \u03b4h\u2032i in Tables 19 and 20.\n32\n\n\fNote that the transformations (37) are not identical at the various c.m. energies, and\nneither are the couplings h\u2032i . Due to the different normalisation of the h\u2032i achieved\nby (37) their errors \u03b4h\u2032i may well increase with rising energy although the errors in a\nfixed basis as in Tables 17 and 18 decrease.\n\n6.4\n\nConstraints from the Total Rate\n\nAs explained in Sect. 3 the measurement of the total cross section restricts the anomalous TGCs in the h\u2032i -basis to a shell between two hyperspheres in the multi-dimensional\nparameter space. For the couplings given in a basis\n\u221a before the transformation we have\nhyperellipsoids instead of hyperspheres. With s = 500 GeV and unpolarised beams\nthe expansion of the total cross section (41) is\n\u03c3/\u03c30 = 1 \u2212 0.026\n\n(100)\n\n+ (h\u20321 + 0.16)2 + (h\u20322 + 0.026)2 + (h\u20323 + 0.0042)2 + (h\u20324 + 0.0061)2\n+ (h\u20325 \u2212 0.013)2 + (h\u20326 \u2212 0.022)2 + (h\u20327 \u2212 0.0093)2 + (h\u20328 + 0.00013)2 +\nAt 800 GeV we obtain\n\n28\nX\n\n(h\u2032i )2 .\n\ni=9\n\n\u03c3/\u03c30 = 1 \u2212 0.016\n\n(101)\n\n+ (h\u20321 + 0.13)2 + (h\u20322 + 0.0078)2 + (h\u20323 + 0.0025)2 + (h\u20324 + 0.0027)2\n+ (h\u20325 \u2212 0.0066)2 + (h\u20326 \u2212 0.013)2 + (h\u20327 \u2212 0.0062)2 + (h\u20328 \u2212 0.00023)2 +\nand, finally, at 3 TeV\n\n28\nX\n\n(h\u2032i )2 ,\n\ni=9\n\n\u03c3/\u03c30 = 1 \u2212 0.0071\n\n(102)\n\n+ (h\u20321 + 0.084)2 + (h\u20322 + 0.00083)2 + (h\u20323 + 4.3 * 10\u22126)2 + (h\u20324 + 0.00060)2\n+\n\n(h\u20325\n\n2\n\n+ 0.0030) +\n\n(h\u20326\n\n2\n\n\u2212 0.0052) +\n\n(h\u20327\n\nh\u2032i\n\n2\n\n\u2212 0.0017) +\n\n(h\u20328\n\n\u22125 2\n\n+ 3.2 * 10 ) +\n\n28\nX\n\n(h\u2032i )2 .\n\ni=9\n\nWe remark again that the couplings\nare not the same at different\nenergies. For\n\u221a\na measurement of the rate N with a (purely statistical) error N the thickness of\nthe shell is 5.8 * 10\u22123 at 500 GeV, 7.2 * 10\u22123 at 800 GeV and 18 * 10\u22123 at 3 TeV\n(cf. Table 3). Systematic errors could be more important. The results (100) agree\nquite well with those of [18] for all couplings except for the smallest term h\u20328 and\nfor h\u20323 . Note that these results strongly depend on a reliable transformation matrix\nA. In [18] numerical instabilities occurred in the diagonalisation procedure, whereas\nhere A is obtained iteratively as explained in Sect. 3 and was found to be stable.\nIt has been pointed out [18] that the constraints from the total rate are in general\nof the same size as the largest error on the couplings determined from the normalised\ndistribution, which we confirm.\n33\n\n\f7\n\nConclusions\n\nIn this paper we have investigated the sensitivity of optimal observables to anomalous\nTGCs in e\u2212 e+ \u2192 W \u2212 W + \u2192 f1 f2 f3 f4 at future linear colliders. We have treated all\n28 couplings at a time and disentangled them by a simultaneous diagonalisation of\nthe covariance matrix of the observables and the term of the integrated cross section\nwhich is quadratic in the anomalous couplings. Several relations arising from discrete\nsymmetry properties of the differential and the total cross section, based on the\nclassification of the TGCs according to their CP and CP Te eigenvalues, have been used\nto simplify the analysis and to check the numerical stability of the results. We have\nre-examined the conditions for investigating CP violation in the presence of polarised\ne+ e\u2212 beams. Suitably defined CP odd observables receive contributions only from\ngenuine CP violation in the interaction and from the CP odd part of the spin density\nmatrix of the initial e+ e\u2212 state. The two kinds of effects can be separated using their\ndifferent dependence on the beam polarisations, either with transversely polarised\nbeams (cf. Sect. 3.3) or with suitable combinations of longitudinal polarisations (cf.\nSect. 4). An analogous statement holds for the investigation of absorptive parts in\nthe scattering amplitude by CP Te odd observables.\nWe find that already at a 500 GeV collider with unpolarised beams and the event\nrates of Table 3, the statistical errors obtained with the optimal-observable method,\ntreating all couplings at a time, are considerably smaller than \u221a\nthe constraints obtained from single parameter fits of LEP2 data. Our errors for s = 500 GeV and\n800 GeV treating all couplings are of the same size or smaller than those obtained at\ngenerator level for TESLA by a spin density matrix method with a restricted number\nof couplings [3, 32].\nWe have performed a detailed study of the sensitivity to anomalous TGCs for\ndifferent longitudinal polarisations and c.m. energies of the lepton beams. The polarisation dependence is conveniently expressed through a parameter P . A simple\nmodel has been analysed (see Figs. 6, 7), which provides an understanding of the\ndependence of sensitivities on P . We find that beam polarisation can provide an\nappreciable gain\n\u221a in sensitivity, especially for right handed couplings (cf. Tables 12\nand 13). At s = 500 GeV the sensitivity to these couplings increases by a factor\nof about 3 when going from unpolarised beams to +80% electron polarisation. With\nadditional \u221260% positron polarisation this factor is about 5 or larger.\nIn the sector of CP conserving imaginary TGCs we have found one linear combination of couplings which appears only quadratically in the differential cross section\nfor longitudinally polarised beams (cf. Sect. 5). Therefore the normalised event distribution of W pair production for unpolarised or longitudinally polarised beams does\nnot provide a good way to measure this coupling-regardless of whether the analysis uses optimal observables or any other method. Information on this coupling can\nhowever be obtained either from the total event rate, or from the normalised event\ndistribution with transversely polarised beams.\n34\n\n\fSince our numerical results are at the \"theory level\", a study using Monte Carlo\nevent samples and including a detector simulation will at some point be necessary.\nAs noted in Sect. 3 inclusion of detector resolution and phase space cuts is easy in\nthe framework of the method presented here.\nIn this work we have analysed the normalised event distributions in the linear\napproximation for anomalous TGCs. We emphasise that the extension of our method\nto the fully non-linear case is available [18]. Such an analysis for the non-linear case\nhas indeed been performed successfully with LEP2 data [20].\nTo summarise, we have performed a detailed study of the sensitivities achievable\nin the measurements of anomalous \u03b3W + W \u2212 and ZW + W \u2212 couplings at future linear\ne+ e\u2212 colliders. We advocate the use of integrated optimal observables for this purpose.\nWe have shown that our method allows for a very good overview of the sensitivities\nand of their dependence on the beam polarisations in the space of the 28 anomalous\ncouplings. Such measurements will be a crucial check wether the structure imposed\nby the fundamental gauge group SU(2)L \u00d7 U(1) of the electroweak interactions in the\nStandard Model for the couplings of three gauge bosons is realised in nature.\n\nAcknowledgements\nThe authors are grateful to W.
