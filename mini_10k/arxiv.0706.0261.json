We study the exponential scale length of total radio emission, the spectral index distribution, and the linear\nradio polarization in the Scd galaxy M33.\nMethods.

Introduction\nM33 (NGC 598), the nearest Scd galaxy at a distance of 840 kpc (1\u2032\u2032 \u2243 4 pc, Freedman et al.\n1991), has been extensively studied at radio\nwavelengths. Terzian & Pankonin (1972) detected\nsome diffuse emission at 318 and 606 MHz using angular resolutions of 17\u2032 and 10\u2032 , respectively. Israel & van der Kruit (1974) observed M33\nat 1415 MHz with the Synthesis telescope in\nWesterbork (WSRT). However, they did not find\nany extended spiral arm emission.

They detected polarization mostly in the northern half of M33 and\nproposed a bisymmetric magnetic field structure.\nThe next interferometer observations (Duric et al.\n1993; Viallefond et al. 1986; Gordon et al. 1999)\nwere carried out in total intensity to study point\nsources like HII regions and supernova remnants\n(SNRs) within M33.\nGenerally, single-dish observations should be\ncarried out to study the extended radio emission.\nSo far, single\u2013dish observations have been limited\nby sensitivity because M33 is relatively weak in radio emission, especially in polarized emission (with\n\nc ESO 2018\n\n\f2\n\nTabatabaei et al.: High resolution radio continuum survey of M33\n\nTable 1.

We describe new observations of the radio\ncontinuum emission at 3.6 cm, 6.2 cm, and 20 cm\nwith much improved detection limits of total and\npolarized intensity and with higher spatial resolutions. These data allow a much more detailed study\nof polarization and magnetic field within M33 than\nwas possible before. We discuss the distribution and\ndegree of linear polarization, integrated flux densities and distribution of the total spectral index (obtained from total intensities of the radio continuum\nemission including both thermal and non-thermal\nemission). We also compare the radial, exponential\nscale lengths of the radio emission at different wavelengths.\nA comprehensive treatment of the separation of\nthermal and non-thermal emission, rotation measures, Faraday effects, depolarization, magnetic\nfield strength and structure, radio\u2013IR correlation,\nand cosmic ray distribution will be given in further\npapers of this series.\nThe observations and data reduction are described in Sect. 2. Results including distributions\nof total intensity and polarization, integrated flux\ndensities and total spectral index distribution are\ndiscussed in Sect. 3. Discussion and concluding remarks are presented in Sect. 4.\n\n2. Observations and data reduction\nWe performed both single-dish and interferometer observations. The single-dish observations at\n3.6 cm and 6.2 cm were made with the 100-m\nEffelsberg telescope1 . The interferometer observa-\n\n2.1. Effelsberg single-dish observations\nWe observed M33 at 3.6 cm during several periods\nfrom August 2005 to March 2006 with the broadband system (bandwidth \u223c 1100 MHz) centered at\n8350 MHz. The receiver is a dual-channel correlation radiometer with cooled HEMT amplifiers and\na cooled polarization transducer located in the secondary focus of the 100-m telescope. The system\nis set up for receiving Left Hand Circular (LHC)\nand Right Hand Circular (RLC) polarization. M33\nwas scanned along RA and DEC with a scanning\nvelocity of 50\u2032 /min on a grid of 30\u2032\u2032 . The scanned\narea of 40\u2032 \u00d7 50\u2032 was centered on the nucleus of\nthe galaxy. The total observing time was about 100\nhours. We obtained 56 coverages with a typical sensitivity per scan of 2 mJy/beam area in total intensity and 0.4 mJy/beam area in polarization. The\nHalf Power Beam Width (HPBW) at 3.6 cm is 83.6\u2032\u2032\nwhich corresponds to a linear resolution of about\n335 pc.\nThe sources 3C 48, 3C 286, and 3C 138 were used\nfor pointing and focusing during the observations.\nCalibration of the flux density and polarization angle was achieved by observing 3C 286. We used the\nflux density scale given by Baars et al. (1977).\nThe data reduction was performed in the NOD2\ndata reduction system (Haslam 1974). In order to\nremove the scanning effects due to ground radiation, weather condition and receiver instabilities,\nwe applied the scanning removal program, Presse,\nof Sofue & Reich (1979). The r.m.s. noise after\ncombination of the coverages (Emerson & Graeve\n1988) is \u223c 220 \u03bcJy/beam in Stokes I (total intensity) map and \u223c 70 \u03bcJy/beam in Stokes U and Q\n(polarization) maps.

The rms\nnoise is 0.14 mJy/beam\nin total intensity and\n0.04 mJy/beam in linear\npolarization. The vectors\nwere plotted starting\nfrom\n0.1 mJy/beam\n(2.5 \u03c3).

Figs. 1 and 2 show the resultant maps of the total and polarized intensities,\nrespectively, smoothed to an angular resolution of\n120\u2032\u2032 .\nObservations at 6.2 cm were carried out in the\nsummer of 1996 using the 4850 MHz HEMT receiver installed in the secondary focus of the 100\u2013m\nEffelsberg telescope. This is a 4-channel 2-beam system with cooled HEMT pre-amplifiers (see Table\n2 for more information about this receiver). M33\nwas scanned along its major axis and perpendicular to it on a grid of 1\u2032 with a scanning velocity\nof 90\u2032 /min. The field size is 100\u2032 \u00d7 80\u2032 . The number of useful coverages is 12 for Stokes I maps and\n\n14 for each U and Q maps. The 6.2 cm data reduction was performed similar to that at 3.6 cm. The\nr.m.s. noise after combination is \u223c 700 \u03bcJy/beam in\nStokes I (total intensity) map and \u223c 180 \u03bcJy/beam\nin Stokes U and Q (polarization) maps. The final\nmaps of total and polarized intensities (smoothed\nto 180\u2032\u2032 ) are shown in Figs. 5 and 6, respectively.\n\n2.2. VLA observations\nWe observed M33 at 20 cm (L\u2013band) in two 50 MHz\nbands centered at 1385 and 1465 MHz with dual\ncircular polarization in the continuum mode of the\nVLA D-array. The observation dates were 06-11-05,\n07-11-05, 08-11-05, 13-11-05, and 06-01-06. To cover\nthe central 30\u2032 \u00d7 45\u2032 with equal sensitivity, we made\na mosaic with 12 pointings with a spacing of half\n\n\f4\n\nTabatabaei et al.: High resolution radio continuum survey of M33\n\nFig. 2.

Position angles of the vectors show the orientation of\nthe apparent magnetic field component perpendicular to the line of sight. Contour levels are 0.1, 0.2, 0.3,\n0.4 mJy/beam. The rms noise is 0.04 mJy/beam. A vector length of 1\u2032 represents a degree of polarization\nof 12.6%.\n\nthe primary beam width, 15\u2032 , (3 pointings along RA\nand 4 pointings along DEC). The coordinates of the\n12 pointings are listed in Table 2. The observations\nwere made in cycles with 6 min on each pointing of\nthe mosaic. This observing cycle was repeated 17\ntimes. At the beginning and end of each 4\u2013cycle,\nwe observed 3C 138 and 3C 48 as the primary flux\ndensity calibrators. The antenna gains and phases\nwere calibrated every 43 min with the phase calibrator 0029 + 349. The source 3C 138 was also used\nfor polarization calibration.\nThe standard procedures of the Astronomical\nImage Processing System (AIPS) were used to reduce the data. The data from each day were calibrated separately to ensure that there were no day\u2013\n\nto day amplitude discrepancies.

To avoid distortions in the combined total intensity (I) map\ndue to strong sources, we first subtracted these\nsources from the VLA map. The sources were identified in the Effelsberg map by comparing with the\nVLA map smoothed to the Effelsberg resolution.\nThen they were also subtracted from the Effelsberg\nmap. The residual VLA and Effelsberg maps were\ncombined using the task 'IMERG' with a maximum spacing of 0.236 k\u03bb for the Effelsberg map\nand a minimum spacing of 0.170 k\u03bb for the VLA\nmap in total intensity. The corresponding maximum and minimum spacing adopted in polarizar-\n\nion (U and Q) are 0.171 k\u03bb and 0.150 k\u03bb, respectively. These maximum and minimum spacing values were chosen so that the integrated flux densities\nof the merged maps became equal to those of the\nEffelsberg maps.

Total intensity\nOur total intensity map of M33 at 3.6 cm is a\nfactor of \u223c 6 more sensitive than the 2.8 cm map\nof Buczilowski & Beck (1987). The map at 3.6 cm\nwith the original angular resolution of 84\u2032\u2032 was\npresented by Tabatabaei et al. (2007). Even after\nsmoothing to 120\u2032\u2032 , the total intensity map (Figs.\n1 and 3) shows that not only the two main optical arms I S3 and I N are well pronounced, but also\n3\n\nWe\nrefer\nto\nthe\narm\nnotation\nof\nHumphreys & Sandage (1980); I N to V N for the\nnorthern and I S to V S for the southern arms.\n\nthe northern arms II N, III N, IV N, and V N are\n(at least partly) visible at 3.6 cm. The total intensity of the extended emission is about 4 mJy/beam\nin the arm I N which increases to 8 mJy/beam in\nparts of the arm I S. The intensity is smaller than\n3 mJy/beam in the other arms. The flux densities\nof 11 brightest HII regions at 3.6 cm are presented\nin Table 4.\nAt 6.2 cm, the rms noise (0.7 mJy/beam) is improved by a factor of two with respect to the previous observations by Buczilowski & Beck (1987).\nThe northern arms and I S plus parts of the southern arms II S and III S are visible in the second contour in Fig. 5.\n\n\f8\n\nTabatabaei et al.: High resolution radio continuum survey of M33\n\nFig. 6.

The polarized emission\nis found partly in the optical arms and partly in between the arms. In the other words, there is no clear\ncorrelation between the optical arms and polarization arm-like structure. The vectors in Fig. 1 (and\nalso 2) show the intrinsic orientation of the ordered\nmagnetic field in the plane of the sky (PI \u223c B2reg\u22a5 ),\nas Faraday rotation is not significant at 3.6 cm. A\ncomparison between the orientation of the ordered\nmagnetic field and optical structure is shown in\nFig. 4. Again, it is seen that the ordered magnetic\nfield traces out some sort of spiral structure which\n\n\fTabatabaei et al.: High resolution radio continuum survey of M33\n\ndoes not coincide well with the optical spiral arms,\nalthough there is a general similarity in the orientations. The strongest arm like filament of the magnetic field exists in between the northern optical\narms IV N and V N, but also covers parts of these\ntwo arms. Generally, in some regions the ordered\nmagnetic field alignes parts of the optical arms (like\nparts of the arms I N and V N), or is driven to the\noptical interarms, or locally distorted in orientation.\nThe latter is mostly seen in the southern part of the\ngalaxy.\nThe vector lengths in Fig. 2 represent the degree\nof polarization, P. Apart from in the northern arm\nIV N, P is not only high where the polarized intensity is strong: the southern optical arms I S, II S also\nshow high P (larger than 20%). The highest degree\nof polarization, \u223c 40%, is found near NGC604 at\nRA = 01h 34m 49.67s and DEC = +30\u25e6 47\u2032 19.49\u2032\u2032\n(Fig. 3). However, it is less than 5% within the giant\nHII regions (eg. NGC604 and NGC595). This plus\na weaker ordered magnetic field (and low P) in the\ncentral southern arm (I S, the strongest arm in radio, IR and optical bands) indicates that high star\nforming activity disturbs locally the regular magnetic field and causes the patchy distribution of the\ndegree of polarization within the arms.\nAt the angular resolution of 180\u2032\u2032 at 6.2 cm, the\nmagnetic arm like filaments are smoother and not\nwell distinguishable (Fig. 6). The strong polarized\nemission (more than 1.2 mJy/beam) again occurs\nin parts of the arms IV N and I N, but in contrast\nto that at 3.6 cm, not in the central regions of the\ngalaxy (Fig. 5). The high P at 6.2 cm (> 20%) has\nalmost the same distribution as at 3.6 cm. In the\narm IV N, the maximum P is about 30%, similar to\nthat at 3.6 cm.\nFig. 7 shows, at a linear resolution of \u223c 200 pc,\nhow the apparent magnetic field vectors (E+90\u25e6)\nat 20 cm are distributed in the plane of the sky. At\nthis wavelength, the vectors are strongly Faraday\nrotated and therefore are not oriented along the\noptical arms. The polarized signal is strongest in\nthe northern part of the galaxy, where the ordering in a spiral like pattern is very clear (Fig. 8),\nwhile the lack of polarized emission in the southern part suggests stronger Faraday depolarization\nin the southern than in the northern part of M33\n(see Sect. 3.6). In the northern arms, the degree of\npolarization P is larger than 20%, with a maximum\nof 30% on the arm IV N and also in a region close\nto NGC604 in I N.\n\n11\n\n3.3. Integrated flux densities\nAfter subtraction of the background sources\n(14 sources whose 20 cm flux densities were\n\u2265 5 mJy/beam), we integrated the flux densities in\nrings in the plane of the galaxy around the center\nout to a radius of 8.5 kpc (beyond the area shown\nin Figs. 1 to 8)(see Table 1). The integrated flux\ndensity in total intensity, ST , and in linear polarization, SP I , at different wavelengths are given in\nTable 5. The corresponding absolute total flux density errors were obtained taking into account the\nsystematic error due to the baselevel uncertainty.\nThe average degree of polarization (P\u0304), which is\nthe ratio of the integrated flux density in polarized\nintensity and the integrated flux density in total intensity, is obtained at different wavelengths (Table\n5). For a consistent comparison, we also obtained\nthe average degree of polarization after smoothing the 3.6 cm and 20 cm maps to the beam width\nof 180\u2032\u2032 , P\u0304(180\u2032\u2032 ). At 3.6 cm and 20 cm, P\u0304(180\u2032\u2032 ) is\nsmaller than P\u0304 due to beam depolarization. P\u0304(180\u2032\u2032 )\nis almost the same at 3.6 cm and 6.2 cm, indicating\nnegligible global Faraday depolarization between\nthese two wavelengths.\nThe integrated total flux densities in total intensity obtained by Buczilowski (1988) of\n1100 \u00b1 167 mJy at 6.3 cm and 2990 \u00b1 440 mJy at\n20 cm out to a radius of 12 kpc agree with our values of 1300 \u00b1 140 mJy at 6.3 cm and 3164 \u00b1 88 mJy\nat 20 cm within the errors. Our obtained value\nat 6.2 cm is even closer to that obtained by\nBerkhuijsen (1983) (1300 \u00b1 200 mJy). The integrated total flux density in total intensity found by\nBuczilowski (1988) at 2.8 cm is significantly smaller\nthan that we found at 3.6 cm because the galaxy\nsize is much larger than the maximum spacing\nof the 2.8 cm multibeam system (Emerson et al.\n1979).\n\n3.4. Distribution of total spectral index\nBecause of their large frequency range, the total\nintensities at 20 cm and 3.6 cm lead to a reliable\nspectral index map. After smoothing to the angular resolution of 90\u2032\u2032 , the total intensity maps at\n20 cm and 3.6 cm were restricted to a common size\nand interpolated onto the same grid. The spectral\nindex, \u03b1 (I \u223c \u03bd \u2212\u03b1 ), was only computed for pixels\nwith a flux density of at least three times the rms\nnoise \u03c3 at both frequencies. In the resultant spectral index map (Fig. 9), the spiral arms and star\nforming regions are well visible as flat spectrum regions. Steeper spectra occur in the outer regions\nand in between arms.

However, the latter\npossibility is unlikely since no IR emission is observed from that region.\n\nFig. 9. Total spectral index map of M33 as determined between the two wavelengths 3.6 and 20 cm.\nThe angular resolution is 90\u2032\u2032 . For the total intensity maps, 3\u03c3 level was considered to obtain this\nspectral index map.\n\nspectral index has a mean value of 0.7. The error in\nthe total spectral index varies from 0.01 in the star\nforming regions to 0.23 in the outer parts.\nThe HII complexes IC 133, NGC 604, and\nNGC 595 have spectral indices < 0.1 and even negative values, indicating optically thick conditions in\nthese HII regions. Johnson et al. (2001) found several optically thick HII regions (at 6 cm and 20 cm)\nwith the two brightest ones in IC 133.\nThe most inverted spectrum is due to a source\nat RA = 01h 32m 42.06\u00b10.14s and DEC = +30\u25e6 54\u2032\n24.8\u00b11.8\u2032\u2032 which has a spectral index of \u22120.6\u00b10.1\n(I3.6cm = 3.6 \u00b1 0.2 and I20cm = 1.24 \u00b1 0.07). This\nsource, which does not exist in the catalogues\nof radio sources and HII regions of M33 (e.g.\n\nWe obtained the radial distribution of the spectral index \u03b1 using the integrated total flux densities\ncalculated in rings with a width of 0.5 kpc in the\ngalactic plane. Fig. 11 presents the radial profile of\nthe spectral index obtained from pairs of the integrated flux densities at 3.6 cm, 6.2 cm, and 20 cm\nconsidering one \u03c3 level. There is a general increase\nin \u03b1 from the center to a radius of about 7 kpc in\nall three profiles. Buczilowski (1988) explained this\nincrease as a general decrease of the thermal fraction with radius. However, with our high resolution\nstudy we detect structures not seen by Buczilowski\n(1988) : a prominant bump around R = 3 kpc and\na steeper increase in \u03b1 beyond R = 4 kpc. This indicates that the thermal fraction decreases faster\nin regions at R > 4 kpc than at smaller radii. The\nbump is located in the ring 2.5 < R < 3 kpc dominated by interarm regions which are expected to be\nweak in thermal emission.\nAssuming that the radial increase of the spectral index is related to a decrease in the thermal\nfraction, and considering that the thermal emission contributes more to the radio continuum emission at smaller wavelengths, one expects more variations (or faster radial increase) of the spectral index obtained at small wavelengths. This is indeed\nvisible in Fig. 11 : \u03b1(3.6, 6.2) increases faster than\n\u03b1(6.2, 20) and \u03b1(3.6, 20) at R > 4 kpc. It is also seen\nthat the larger the wavelengths, the smaller the\nspectral index (or flatter energy spectrum at larger\nwavelengths). This is surprising as one expects that\nthe spectrum of the radio continuum emission becomes steeper at larger wavelengths because of the\nsynchrotron emission. This could hint to the nonthermal energy losses at larger wavelengths. The\nreason may be the same as of the significant flattening of the integrated spectrum of M33 at frequencies lower than 900 MHz : free-free absorption of the\nnon-thermal emission by a cool (< 1000 K) ionized\ngas (Israel et al. 1992).

Total spectral index averaged in rings of\n0.5 kpc width in the galactic plane versus the radial distance from the center of M33. For the total\nintensity maps, one \u03c3 level was considered before\nintegration.\n\ncally thick HII regions (Johnson et al. 2001) could\nalso enhance this trend.\nAway from star forming regions and in the outer\nparts of the galaxy, the thermal fraction is negligible and the observed spectral index \u03b1 can be\ntaken as the non-thermal spectral index, \u03b1n . From\nFig. 9, we obtain \u03b1n \u2243 1.0 \u00b1 0.1, which is equal\nto that found in M31 by Berkhuijsen et al. (2003).\nAssuming that the non-thermal spectral index is\nconstant across M33, we find average thermal fractions of 0.52 \u00b1 0.15, 0.46 \u00b1 0.12, and 0.18 \u00b1 0.06\nat 3.6 cm, 6.2 cm, and 20 cm, respectively (following the method by Klein et al. 1984). How these\nvalues change if the non-thermal spectral index is\nnot assumed to be constant across the galaxy will\nbe discussed in paper II (Tabatabaei et al. in prep.).\n\n3.5. Integrated radio continuum spectrum\nThe integrated flux densities for R < 50\u2032 (12 kpc)\nfrom Effelsberg surveys at 35.6, 21.1, 17.4, 11.1, 6.3,\nand 2.8 cm were presented by Buczilowski (1988).\nThey obtained a spectrum with a spectral index of\n0.91 \u00b1 0.13, steeper than found in many other spiral\ngalaxies.\nWe rederived the integrated spectrum of M33\nusing three more data points from the new surveys. We calculated the integrated flux densities\nfor the 3.6, 6.2, and 20 cm maps for the same\narea of R < 50\u2032 . The 3.6 cm and 2.8 cm maps were\nintegrated up to R = 44\u2032 and R = 22.5\u2032 , respectively, providing a lower limit to the total flux density. However, extrapolated values up to R = 50\u2032\nshow that the missing flux densities are within errors. Our values together with those of Buczilowski\n(1988) (see Table 6) lead to an integrated spectrum\n(Fig. 11) with a spectral index of 0.72 \u00b1 0.04, which\nis in agreement with the mean spectral index obtained in Sect. 3.4 using a different method.\n\n\f14\n\nTabatabaei et al.: High resolution radio continuum survey of M33\n\nTable 8.

This indicates that the surface\nbrightness decreases faster with increasing radius at\nR > 4 kpc at all wavelengths. Since the 24 \u03bcm emission (and also 3.6 cm emission, Tabatabaei et al.\n2007) traces the star forming regions, this confirms that the main star forming regions in M33\nare spread over an area with a radius of R < 4 kpc\nwithout a dominant 'nuclear concentration' (different from the situation in NGC6946, Walsh et al.\n2002).\nTable 7 also shows that the scale length increases with increasing wavelength in the radio\nregime. This can be explained by the fact that at\nlonger wavelengths the non-thermal emission becomes more dominant, and the influence of radial\ndiffusion of cosmic ray electrons becomes more important, leading to larger scale lengths.\n\n3.7. North\u2013south asymmetry\n\nFig. 13. Radial profiles of total intensity (surface\nbrightness) at radio and IR wavelengths.\n\n3.6. Exponential scale lengths\nFig. 13 shows the radial distributions of the total\nradio and IR (Spitzer 24, 70, and 160 \u03bcm) intensities\nin M33 with galactocentric radius. There is a break\nin the profiles near R = 4 kpc, which is best visible\nat 3.6 cm and 24 \u03bcm. All the profiles can be well\nfitted by two exponential functions of the form\n\u001a\nI0 exp(\u2212R/lR<4kpc )\nR < 4 kpc\nI(R) =\n(1)\nI4 exp(\u2212R/lR>4kpc )\nR \u2265 4 kpc,\nwhere, I0 and I4 are the intensity at R = 0 and\nR = 4 kpc, respectively, and l is the exponential\nscale length.\nWe derived the exponential scale lengths of the\nradio emission at the three wavelengths along with\nthose of the IR emission (Table 7). Generally, the\nscale lengths are larger in regions at R < 4 kpc\n\nFig. 7 shows that the polarized emission at 20 cm\nis much weaker in the southern than in the northern half. To investigate this asymmetry, we calculated the integrated total flux density in both total and polarized intensities separately over each\nhalf (Table 8). The average degrees of polarization\nare also given in Table 8. At all three radio wavelengths, the beam width is 180\u2032\u2032 . The ratio of the\nnorthern to the southern integrated total flux denS\nsity in polarized intensity, SN\nP I /SP I , and also the\nratio of the average degree of polarization, P\u0304N / P\u0304S ,\nS\nincreases with wavelength. SN\nT /ST , does not change\nfrom 3.6 cm to 6.2 cm and from 6.2 cm to 20 cm\nwithin the errors, but, it decreases slightly from\n3.6 cm to 20 cm. A wavelength-dependent asymmetry in the polarized intensity and average degree of\npolarization was also found in other galaxies e.g.\nNGC 6946 (Beck, submitted to A&A). The interpretation is that there is an asymmetry in Faraday\ndepolarization along the line of sight that may be\ncaused in several ways:\n- asymmetry in the distribution of the thermal emission,\n- asymmetry in the uniformity of the magnetic field\nstrength,\n- special large-scale structure of the regular mag-\n\n\fTabatabaei et al.: High resolution radio continuum survey of M33\n\nnetic field, like e.g. a large-scale axisymmetric helical magnetic field (Urbanik et al. 1997).\nWe will investigate these possibilities after the separation of thermal/non-thermal components in a\nforthcoming paper (Tabatabaei et al. in prep.).\n\n4. Discussion and conclusions\nRadio observations with high resolution and sensitivity enabled us to obtain much more information about the distribution of the linearly polarized emission in M33 than in previous studies, especially, at high frequencies where the Faraday effects are negligible. Using the new data at 3.6 cm,\nwe found that the magnetic field is well ordered\nin a spiral structure with the general orientation\nof the optical spiral arms. No clear ordered magnetic field\u2013optical arm anti-correlation, as observed\nin other galaxies like NGC6946 (Beck & Hoernes\n1996), M81 (Krause et al. 1989a), and in parts of\nIC342 (Krause et al. 1989b; Krause 1993), is found\nin M33. Detection of high degrees of polarization\n(larger than 20%), not only in the northern arms\nbut also in the central extended region and in parts\nof the southern arms at 3.6 cm and 6.2 cm (for the\nfirst time), is another significant result of this study.\nGenerally, we found a patchy distribution of the degree of polarization. The degree of polarization in\nthe direction of the HII complexes is less than 5%.\nWe also found a weak degree of polarization and\nsome distortion in the regular magnetic field in the\ncentral I S, which could be linked to the high star\nforming activity in this region.\nWe derived a spectral index map of M33 with a\nhigh angular resolution (90\u2032\u2032 ) (the previous spectral\nindex map was derived at 462\u2032\u2032 , Buczilowski 1988).\nBoth the mean total spectral index (0.72 \u00b1 0.07, obtained from the 3.6 and 20 cm maps) and the total\nspectral index obtained from the integrated spectrum (0.72 \u00b1 0.04) are consistent with the result of a\nstatistical study on 56 spiral galaxies by Gioia et al.\n(1982).\nThe radial profile of the spectral index (Fig. 11)\nshows not only a general increase but also fluctuations at 2 < R < 4 kpc, confirming that the decrease in the thermal fraction causes an increase\nin the spectral index. Considering Fig. 13, at\n2 < R < 4 kpc, we found opposite fluctuations in total intensity and in spectral index. These fluctuations (in Fig. 13) are again stronger at wavelengths\nat which either the thermal emission is stronger\n(i.e. 3.6 cm) or the emission correlates well with the\nthermal emission (i.e. 24 \u03bcm, see Tabatabaei et al.\n2007). The area at 2 < R < 3 kpc includes the region\nbetween the main arm I (I N, I S) and the central\n\n15\n\nextended region of the galaxy, corresponding to the\nsmall maximum (bump) in the spectral index profile\nand a small minimum in the total intensity profile.\nThe area at 3 < R < 4 kpc includes the arm I N and\nNGC604, corresponding to the small minimum in\nFig. 11 and the small maximum in Fig. 13.\nLike the star formation radial profile (24 \u03bcm radial profile, see Sect. 3.6), the mostly non-thermal\n20 cm radial profile is fitted by a larger exponential scale length at R < 4 kpc than at R > 4 kpc.\nThis is a surprising result, indicating that even\nthe non-thermal emission (which is less confined\nto the star forming regions than the thermal emission) mimics the distribution of its parents, the\nstar forming regions. A spatial coupling between\nthe non-thermal emission and star forming regions was also found in other late-type galaxies\n(Dumke et al. 2000; Chy\u017cy et al. 2007). Therefore,\nit would be highly interesting to derive the distribution of the non-thermal emission for a more realistic non-constant spectral index of the non-thermal\nemission (Tabatabaei et al. paper II).\nAcknowledgements.
