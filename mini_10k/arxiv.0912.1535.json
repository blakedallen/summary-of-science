This leads us to an interesting thermodynamical analogy of emergent quantum\nmechanics.\n\n1 Introduction\nQuantum mechanics as a statistical theory has been argued to emerge from an underlying deterministic theory [1]. Specifically, for any quantum system there exists at least\none deterministic model that reproduces all its dynamics after prequantisation. This existence theorem has been extended to include cases characterised by sets of commuting\nbeables [2]; it has also been complemented with an explicit dynamical theory [3].\nMechanisms have been presented [1, 2, 3] to explain the passage from a deterministic theory to a probabilistic theory. Usually they are based on a dynamical system,\nthe phase\u2013space trajectories of which possess suitably located attractors (e.g., at the\neigenvalues of the given quantum Hamiltonian, or at certain configurations of the density matrix). These mechanisms can be thought of as an existence theorem, in that\nevery quantum system (with a finite\u2013dimensional Hilbert space) possesses at least one\ndeterministic system underlying it.\nOn the other hand there are plenty of dissipation equations in physics and mathematics, equations implementing the information loss that is characteristic of the passage from classical to quantum. The heat equation immediately comes to mind.\nIn this contribution we develop a deterministic model exhibiting dissipation, from\nwhich quantum mechanics emerges naturally. Given a quantum mechanics with a complex d\u2013dimensional Hilbert space, the Lie group SU (d) represents classical canonical\ntransformations on the projective space CPd\u22121 of quantum states. Let R stand for the\nRicci flow [4] of the manifold SU (d \u2212 1) down to one point, and let P denote the projection from the Hopf bundle onto its base CPd\u22121 . Then the underlying deterministic\n\n1\n\n\fmodel we propose here is the Lie group SU (d), acted on by the operation P R.\nWe would like to mention that additional quantum\u2013mechanical applications of the\nRicci flow have been reported in [5, 6, 7, 8]; deterministic models of quantum mechanics and closely related topics are dealt with at length in [9, 10, 11, 12].\n\n2 The Ricci flow as a (nonlinear) heat flow\nGiven an n\u2013dimensional manifold M endowed with the Riemannian metric gij , the\nequation governing the (unnormalised) Ricci flow reads\n\u2202gij\n= \u22122Rij ,\n\u2202t\n\ni, j = 1, . . . , n,\n\nt \u2265 0,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere t is an evolution parameter (not a coordinate on M), and Rij is the Ricci tensor\ncorresponding to the metric gij . Informally one can say that Ricci\u2013flat spaces remain\nunchanged under the flow, while positively curved manifolds contract and negatively\ncurved manifolds expand under the flow. We will be interested in the particular case of\nEinstein manifolds, where the Ricci tensor and the metric are proportional:\nRij = \u03bagij ,\n\n(2)\n\nwith \u03ba a constant. Since the metric gij is assumed positive definite, the sign of \u03ba\nequals the sign of the Ricci tensor. Relevant examples of positively curved Einstein\nmanifolds are complex projective space CPN and the special unitary group SU (N ),\nboth of which will play an important role in what follows. Their respective metrics are\nthe Fubini\u2013Study metric [13] and the Killing\u2013Cartan metric [14].\nUnder the Ricci flow, the contraction of a whole manifold down to a point can\nplay the role of a dissipative mechanism. One hint that this intuition is correct comes\nfrom the following example. Consider a 2\u2013dimensional manifold endowed with the\nisothermal coordinates x and y. Then the metric reads\n\u0001\n(3)\nds2 = e\u2212f (x,y) dx2 + dy 2 .\n\nAllowing the metric to depend also on the evolution parameter t, the Ricci flow equation (1) becomes\n\u2202f\n= \u22072 f.\n(4)\n\u2202t\nThe above is formally identical to the heat equation, with one important difference,\nhowever: the Laplacian \u22072 is computed with respect to the metric (3), in which it\nreads\n\u0013\n\u0012 2\n\u22022f\n\u2202 f\n2\nf\n(5)\n+ 2 .\n\u2207 f =e\n\u2202x2\n\u2202y\nRegardless of the nonlinearity of (5), the fact that the Ricci\u2013flow equation can be recast\nas a generalisation of the heat equation is a clear hint that a dissipative mechanism is at\nwork.\n\n2\n\n\f3 The deterministic model for pure states\nIn this section we will consider a quantum system with a finite, complex d\u2013dimensional\nHilbert space of quantum states, that we can identify with Cd . Let C denote the phase\nspace of the classical model, the quantisation of which gives the quantum system under consideration. For our purposes the precise nature of this classical model on C\nis immaterial. Now unitary transformations on Hilbert space are the quantum counterpart of canonical transformations on classical phase space C. We may thus regard\nSU (d) as representing classical canonical transformations, Cd being the carrier space\nof this representation. We are considering, as in ref. [1], the simplified case of a finite\u2013\ndimensional Hilbert space. Without loss of generality we will restrict to those canonical\ntransformations that are represented by unitary matrices with determinant equal to 1.\nNow quantum states are unit rays rather than vectors, so in fact the true space of\ninequivalent quantum states is the complex projective space CPd\u22121 . The latter can be\nregarded as a homogeneous manifold:\nCPd\u22121 =\n\nSU (d)\n.\nSU (d \u2212 1) \u00d7 U (1)\n\n(6)\n\nIn this picture we have SU (d) as the total space of a fibre bundle with typical fibre\nSU (d \u2212 1) \u00d7 U (1) over the base manifold CPd\u22121 . The projection map\n\u03c0 : SU (d) \u2212\u2192 CPd\u22121 ,\n\n\u03c0(w) := [w]\n\n(7)\n\narranges points w \u2208 SU (d) into SU (d \u2212 1) \u00d7 U (1) equivalence classes [w].\nClassical canonical transformations as represented by SU (d) act on the Hilbert\nspace Cd . This descends to an action \u03b1 of SU (d) on CPd\u22121 as follows:\n\u03b1 : SU (d) \u00d7 CPd\u22121 \u2212\u2192 CPd\u22121 ,\n\n\u03b1 (u, [v]) := [uv].\n\n(8)\n\nHere we have u \u2208 SU (d), [v] \u2208 CPd\u22121 , and uv denotes d \u00d7 d matrix multiplication.\nOne readily checks that this action is well defined on the equivalence classes under\nright multiplication by elements of the stabiliser subgroup SU (d \u2212 1) \u00d7 U (1). This\nallows one to regard quantum states as equivalence classes of classical canonical transformations on C. Physically, u in (8) denotes (the representative matrix of) a canonical\ntransformation on C, and [v] denotes the equivalence class of (representative matrices\nof) the canonical transformation v or, equivalently, the quantum state |vi.\nIn the picture just sketched, two canonical transformations are equivalent whenever\nthey differ by a canonical transformation belonging to SU (d\u22121), and/or whenever they\ndiffer by a U (1)\u2013transformation. Modding out by U (1) has a clear physical meaning:\nit is the standard freedom in the choice of the phase of the wavefunction corresponding\nto the matrix v \u2208 SU (d). Modding out by SU (d \u2212 1) also has a physical meaning:\ncanonical transformations on the (d \u2212 1)\u2013dimensional subspace Cd\u22121 \u2282 Cd are a\nsymmetry of v. Therefore the true quantum state |vi is obtained from v \u2208 SU (d) after\nmodding out by the stabiliser subgroup SU (d \u2212 1) \u00d7 U (1).\nWe conclude that this picture contains some of the elements identified as responsible for the passage from a classical world (canonical transformations) to a quantum\n3\n\n\fworld (equivalence classes of canonical transformations, or unit rays within Hilbert\nspace). This is so because some kind of dissipative mechanism is at work, through the\nemergence of orbits, or equivalence classes. However the projection (7) is an on/off\nmechanism. Instead, one would like to see dissipation occurring as a flow along some\ncontinuous parameter. To this end we need some deterministic flow governed by some\ndifferential equation.\nWe claim that we can render the projection (7) a dissipative mechanism governed\nby some differential equation. This equation will turn out to be the Ricci flow (1).\nProof of this statement follows.\nThe Lie group SU (d \u2212 1) \u00d7 U (1) is compact, but it is not semisimple due to\nthe Abelian factor U (1). Leaving the U (1) factor momentarily aside, SU (d \u2212 1) is\nsemisimple and compact. As such it qualifies as an Einstein space with positive scalar\ncurvature with respect to the Killing\u2013Cartan metric [14]. Now eqn. (1) ensures that\nSU (d \u2212 1) contracts to a point under the Ricci flow.\nHowever the U (1) factor renders SU (d \u2212 1) \u00d7 U (1) nonsemisimple. As a consequence, the Killing\u2013Cartan metric of SU (d \u2212 1) \u00d7 U (1) has a vanishing determinant\n[14]. The Ricci flow can still cancel the SU (d \u2212 1)\u2013factor within SU (d), but not\nthe U (1) factor. After contracting SU (d \u2212 1) to a point we are left with the space\nU (1) \u00d7 CPd\u22121 or, more generally, with a U (1)\u2013bundle over the base manifold CPd\u22121 .\nThis U (1)\u2013bundle over CPd\u22121 is the Hopf bundle, where the total space is the sphere\nS 2d\u22121 in 2d \u2212 1 real dimensions [13]. This sphere falls short of being the true space of\nquantum states by the unwanted U (1)\u2013fibre, that cannot be removed by the Ricci flow.\nIt can, however, be done away with by projection P from the total space of the bundle\ndown to its base. The combined operation \"Ricci flow R, followed by projection P \"\nacts on the stabiliser subgroup SU (d \u2212 1) \u00d7 U (1) of the initial SU (d) and leaves us\nwith CPd\u22121 as desired. Therefore this combined operation P R acts in the same way as\nthe projection \u03c0 in (7). As opposed to the latter, however, this combined operation P R\nprovides us with a differential equation that implements dissipation along a continuous\nparameter, at least along most of the way.\n\n4 The deterministic model for mixed states\nWe have so far dealt only with pure quantum states. In trying to extend our previous\nanalysis to mixed quantum states, we must first answer the following two questions:\nWhat is the manifold of mixed quantum states, and what sign does its Ricci scalar\nhave? Mixed states can be represented by density matrices D, expressible as\nD=\n\nn\nX\n\n|vj ipj hvj |,\n\nn > 1,\n\n(9)\n\nj=1\n\nthe pj > 0 being the probability of finding the system in the pure state |vj i. Above we\nassume that n > 1, i.e., that the state considered is not pure but truly mixed. The pj\nmust add up to unity,\nn\nX\npj = 1.\n(10)\nj=1\n\n4\n\n\fIt turns out that the manifold of density matrices is a norm\u2013closed (with respect to the\ntrace norm), convex subset of the unit sphere of the space of trace\u2013class operators (see,\ne.g., [15]). In the finite\u2013dimensional setup considered here, all operators are trace class,\nand we are left with a convex subset of the unit sphere of the space of d \u00d7 d Hermitian\nmatrices. Now the space of d \u00d7 d Hermitian matrices has (real) dimension d2 \u2212 1, so\nits unit sphere is d2 \u2212 2 (real) dimensional. The manifold of mixed states is a convex\n2\nsubset of the real sphere S d \u22122 . In particular, the latter has positive Ricci curvature.\nOn the other hand, the N \u2013dimensional sphere S N equals the homogeneous manifold\nSO(N + 1)/SO(N ), so our manifold of mixed quantum states is a convex subset of\nSd\n\n2\n\n\u22122\n\n=\n\nSO(d2 \u2212 1)\n.\nSO(d2 \u2212 2)\n\n(11)\n\nAs in the case of pure states, the special orthogonal groups in the numerator and in\nthe denominator above carry positive Ricci curvature with respect to the corresponding\nKilling\u2013Cartan metric [14].\nNow eqn. (11) differs very little from (6), that we discussed at length in the case of\npure quantum states. One difference between these two equations is that (6) contains\nthe unitary groups, while (11) contains the special orthogonal groups. Another difference is that the Abelian factor U (1) in the denominator of (6) has disappeared from\n(11) (one could still mod out the right\u2013hand side of (11) by the discrete group Z2 in\norder to obtain real projective space, but the latter is not related to the space of density\nmatrices). One final difference between the pure and the mixed case is that the latter\ndoes not have the full left\u2013hand side of (11) as the space of quantum states, but only a\nconvex subset thereof.\nAll this notwithstanding, these three differences do not suffice to prevent the analysis (and the ensuing conclusions) of the case of pure quantum states from applying to\nthe case of mixed quantum states as well. It is interesting to observe that mixed quantum states are actually simpler to deal with than pure states, because the absence of the\nAbelian factor in the denominator of (11) allows one to dispense with the projection P\nfrom the Hopf bundle-in fact, in the mixed case there is no Hopf bundle at all.\nHaving seen that the case of mixed quantum states does not differ substantially\nfrom that of pure states, for the rest of this contribution we will concentrate on pure\nquantum states.\n\n5 Positive curvature mimics a quantum\nOur starting point was the observation that canonical transformations on classical phase\nspace are implemented quantum\u2013mechanically as unitary transformations on the Hilbert\nspace of quantum states. In our finite\u2013dimensional setup, this gave rise to a natural action of SU (d) on Cd . This action provided us with the building blocks to construct\nthe deterministic system that we take to underlie the given quantum mechanics. Next,\ndifferent pieces of classical information (elements of SU (d), or classical canonical\ntransformations) were arranged into quantum equivalence classes (points on CPd , or\nquantum states): this procedure implements information loss, or dissipation. Quantum\nstates thus arose as equivalence classes of canonical transformations on classical phase\n5\n\n\fspace. However, dissipation was not implemented by means of the usual projection\n(7) (an on/off mechanism), but rather by means of the Ricci flow (followed by the projection P ). The rationale was that the Ricci flow provided us with a a deterministic\nmechanism governed by a dissipative differential equation, that can be understood as a\nflow along a continuous parameter.\nIn a nutshell, our deterministic model is the group manifold SU (d), acted on by\nthe combined operation P R described above. Here R stands for the Ricci flow of\nSU (d \u2212 1) down to one point, and P stands for the projection from the Hopf bundle\nwith total space S 2d\u22121 onto its base CPd\u22121 .\nThe previous conclusions can be compactly recast, somewhat in the style of newspaper headlines, as positive curvature mimics a quantum [16, 17]. This raises the\nquestion, how about negative curvature? From what was said above it should be clear\nthat the answer is negative: negative curvature cannot mimic a quantum, since negative\ncurvature causes expansion, rather than contraction to a point. Temporarily abandoning\nour geometrical stance, let us take a brief thermodynamical detour that will lend further\nsupport to our statement concerning negative curvature. Thermodynamics is a coarse\u2013\ngrained version of an underlying microscopic theory, namely, statistical mechanics.\nCoarse\u2013graining the notion of mechanical energy in statistical mechanics gives rise to\nthe thermodynamical notion of heat. In our setup, the analogue of the heat equation\nis the Ricci flow equation. Admittedly, the classical heat equation is linear while the\nRicci flow equation is not, but this difference will play no role here. In fact, the analogy\nbetween these two equations goes so far, that the Ricci flow equation (1) can actually\nbe derived from a functional F , called Perelman's functional [4], which happens to be\na monotonically increasing function of the time t. Therefore F qualifies as an entropy.\nNow heat flow occurs from higher temperature to lower temperature; such a heat flow\nis accompanied by an increase in entropy. This reveals what the thermodynamical analogue of negative curvature must be: heat flowing from lower temperature to higher\ntemperature. This is clearly unphysical. Thus thermodynamics meets geometry in the\nstatement that negative curvature cannot mimic a quantum.\nWe would also like to point out that a related form of coarse\u2013graining has been\nput forward [18] in order to explain the emergence of quantum mechanics from an\nunderlying deterministic theory. In fact we can provide a dictionary between our thermodynamical analogy, on the one hand, and the requirements imposed on the operation\nof coarse\u2013graining in ref. [18], on the other. Namely: probability conservation in [18]\ncorresponds to energy conservation in our thermodynamical analogy, while dissipation\nin [18] is matched, in our picture, by increase in entropy.\nLooking beyond, one could even pose the question: regardless of the sign, why\ncurvature at all? We have seen that Ricci\u2013flat spaces remain unchanged under the Ricci\nflow. In our thermodynamical analogy, this would correspond to no heat flow at all,\nthat is, to a temperature distribution satisfying the static Laplace equation \u22072 T = 0. A\nnonvanishing (and, as we have argued, positive) value of the scalar curvature provides\nus with a natural length scale: the Ricci scalar. With it, a natural notion of a quantum\ncomes along.\n\n6\n\n\fAcknowledgements J.M.I. is pleased to thank the organizers of the meeting QTRF5\n(Quantum Theory: Reconsideration of Foundations 5, V\u00e4xj\u00f6, Sweden) for the invitation to participate, and for providing a congenial environment for scientific exchange.\nIt is also a great pleasure to thank H.-T.
