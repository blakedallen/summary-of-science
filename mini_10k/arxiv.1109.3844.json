The\nstandard model has been cold, non-interacting dark matter\n(CDM), which, while successful in simulations of large-scale\nstructure formation, is less so in the details. Steep density\nprofiles (Colin et al. 2004) (though better baryon physics\nmay improve this: see Cole et al. 2011 and Jardel & Sellwood 2009), overproduction of small halos (Mikheeva et al.\n2007, Diemand et al. 2005), failure to predict the zero point\nof the Tully-Fisher relation (Mo & Mao 2000), and spiral\ngalaxy bar rotation speeds (De Battista & Sellwood 2000,\n1998) all present unresolved questions for CDM.\n\n?\n\nE-mail: zslepian@cfa.harvard.edu\n\u2020 E-mail: jeremy@astro.princeton.edu\nc 0000 RAS\n\nIn the early aughts, self-interacting dark matter (SIDM)\nappeared appealing because it promised to resolve some of\nthese questions. A spate of papers explored SIDM (Spergel\n& Steinhardt 2000, Goodman 2000, Wandelt 2000, Peebles\n2000) and of late interest has returned to this topic (Loeb\n& Weiner 2011, Su & Chen 2011). In particular, bosonic\nSIDM has provoked considerable theoretical work (Chavanis 2011, Rindler-Daller & Shapiro 2011, Rindler-Daller &\nShapiro 2010), especially as scalar-field dark matter (SFDM)\n(the scalar field encodes a self-interaction) (Briscese 2011,\nAmaro-Seoane et al. 2010, Lee 2009, Lee & Lim 2010, UrenaLopez 2009, Bernal et al. 2008, Bernal & Guzman 2006,\nMatos & Urena-Lopez 2002). We also note that many have\nstudied non-self-interacting bosonic dark matter; see Harko\n2011 I and II, Bernal et al. 2008, and Urena-Lopez 2009.\nNon-bosonic self-interacting dark matter has also been considered; see Koda & Shapiro 2011, Ahn & Shapiro 2005,\nMitra 2005, and Hennawi & Ostriker 2001.\nGiven this, it is worthwhile to consider whether SIDM\ncould produce realistic halo density profiles and rotation\ncurves, with the aim of moving away from these models if\nthey cannot. In this paper, we calculate density profiles and\nrotation curves for a representative such model first presented in Goodman 2000. The dark matter is a short-range\n\n\f2\n\nSlepian and Goodman\n\nrepulsively interacting boson with repulsion strength, mass,\nand interaction cross section to be determined by observational constraints. We place an upper bound on the DM\nparticle mass using a constraint from the Bullet Cluster,\nand a lower bound on the mass by demanding that the dark\nmatter halo, modeled as an isothermal sphere, produce an\nobservationally allowed rotation curve. Note that this second\nconstraint applies only if the DM is in thermal equilibrium\n(further discussion in \u00a75).\nThese two constraints are incompatible: the lower\nbound is greater than the upper bound. Hence we conclude that bosonic repulsive dark matter (RDM) in thermal equilibrium can be ruled out. This conclusion can be\navoided if RDM halos have not reached even local thermodynamic equilibrium by the present epoch. However, in that\ncase the model is very similar to the traditional, effectively\nnon-interacting axion (because the scattering must be small\nenough so as not to produce thermal equilibrium), except\nthat collective repulsion could still support a core. Streaming motions would be required to explain the extended parts\nof the halo outside the core, as with conventional noninteracting dark matter. Further discussion of these points occurs\nin \u00a75.\nThe paper is structured as follows. In \u00a72, we compute\nthe scattering cross section and pressure. In \u00a73, we present\nisothermal spherical halo models. In \u00a74, we combine the constraints of \u00a72 and \u00a73 and show that they cannot simultaneously be satisfied. We discuss our results and conclude in \u00a75.\nIn two Appendices, we discuss the calculations behind the\nequation of state and examine the drag on a perturbation\nto the halo, e.g. a rotating galactic bar.\nThroughout, \u03c3 denotes a cross section and m the dark\nmatter particle's mass. \u03bd is always a number density. We define all other symbols where they are used, and also provide\na table of the main symbols defined in this paper and their\nmeanings for easy reference (Table 1).\n\n2\n2.1\n\nSCATTERING CROSS SECTION AND\nPRESSURE\nDetails of the RDM\n\nAs preliminary to the scattering cross section and pressure,\nwe present an overview of the RDM model, beginning with\nthe relativistic formalism, moving on to discuss the minimum core size, and concluding with other remarks. Like the\naxion, the DM particles are bosonic and are supposed to\nbe born in a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) in the early\nuniverse (Goodman 2000, Peebles 2000). Peebles and Goodman both argued that if present-day repulsive dark matter\nderives from a relativistic scalar field, then it has acceptable\nbehavior in the early universe, i.e. it does not suppress largescale structure or unduly affect primordial nucleosynthesis.\nThe dark matter particles' interaction would naturally\nbe short-range, in fact point-like, if it corresponded to the\nnon-relativistic limit of a massive complex scalar field with\nmass m and a momentum-independent self-interaction term\nV (\u03c6, \u03c6\u2217 ) = \u03bb(\u03c6\u2217 \u03c6)2 . We therefore treat the RDM as an assemblage of non-relativistic point particles of mass m having a two-body interaction potential U whose range is small\ncompared to the particles' de Broglie wavelength, so that\n\nU (x1 \u2212 x2 ) \u2192 U0 \u03b4(x1 \u2212 x2 ). The constant U0 \u2261 \u0168 (0) is the\nFourier transform of U (\u2206x) evaluated at zero momentum.\nAt tree level, U0 = \u03bb~3 /4m2 c in conventional units, \u03bb\nbeing dimensionless and nonnegative. In contrast to Goodman (2000), we have taken the field to be complex so that\nthe particles are conserved, being protected from mutual annihilation via this same interaction term by a global phase\nsymmetry \u03c6 \u2192 ei\u03c8 \u03c6.1 Otherwise the particles would annihilate via a cascade of stimulated emission in less than a\nHubble time, unless their mass were so small and their interaction so weak as to preclude the establishment of local\nthermodynamic equilibrium (Riotto & Tkachev 2000).\nIn the condensate, pressure varies only with density.\nWith a quartic self-interaction potential such as we have\nadopted above, Goodman (2000) notes that in the nonrelativistic limit P \u001c \u03c1c2 , pressure and density are related as in an n = 1 Emden polytrope, P = K\u03c12 , with\nK = U0 /2m2 . The density profile is\n\u03c1(r) = \u03c1(0)\n\nsin(\u03c0r/rc )\n\u03c0r/rc\n\nwith 0 6 r 6 rc and core radius\nr\nr\n\u03c0K\n\u03c0U0\nrc =\n=\n.\n2G\n4Gm2\n\n(1)\n\n(2)\n\nThe total mass within rc associated with the profile (1) is\nMc = 4\u03c1(0)rc3 /\u03c0. The velocity vc of a circular orbit at the\nedge of the core is therefore given by\nvc2 \u2261\n\n4G\u03c1(0)rc2\n\u03c1(0)U0\nGMc\n=\n= 2K\u03c1(0) =\n,\nrc\n\u03c0\nm2\n\n(3)\n\nin which the second and third equalities result from eliminating rc2 using eq. (2).\nIf all of the DM were still in the condensate, then all\nnon-rotating dark halos in virial equilibrium would have this\nsize and density profile independent of their masses. Clearly\nthis would not be acceptable, especially if the core radius\nrc \u223c 1 kpc as required to match the DM cores of dwarf\ngalaxies. However, more complex and extended profiles can\nbe obtained if the DM has a finite temperature, as we discuss in the remainder of this paper, or where it has not yet\nreached thermal or even hydrostatic equilibrium.\nAs we will show, the scattering cross section per unit\nmass is \u03c3scatt /m = mU02 /2\u03c0~4 . Since this involves a combination of m and U0 independent from that appearing in the\ncore radius (2), the degree of collisionality of RDM is independent of its minimum core size. Thus it seems possible to\nevade the constraint on \u03c3scatt /m set by the Bullet Cluster\n(Randall et al. 2008). However, as will be shown, one then\nencounters difficulties with halo rotation curves.\n2.2\n\nScattering Cross Section\n\nIn the first-order Born approximation, the interaction potential U (x1 , x2 ) = U0 \u03b4(x1 \u2212 x2 ) between identical nonrel1\n\nWhat is actually conserved is the (non-electromagnetic)\n\"charge\" represented by the number of particles minus the number of antiparticles. For a relativistic chemical potential \u03bc =\n\u03bcnr + mc2 , with nonrelativistic counterpart \u03bcnr , in the nonrelativistic limit the antiparticles become so sparse that \"charge\" can\nbe identified with particle number.\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n\fRuling Out Bosonic Repulsive Dark Matter in Thermal Equilibrium\nativistic bosons entails the scattering cross section\nm2 U02\n.\n(4)\n2\u03c0~4\nWe can eliminate U0 and rewrite \u03c3scatt in terms of the core\nradius (2):\n\u03c3scatt =\n\n8G2 m6 rc4\n.\n(5)\n\u03c0 3 ~4\nFrom the Bullet Cluster, we have the constraint that\n\u03c3scatt /m < 1.25 cm2 g\u22121 (Randall et al. 2008); substituting eq. (5) into this relation implies that\n\u0012\n\u0013\u22124/5\nrc\n\u22124\nm < 9.6 \u00d7 10 \u00d7\neV/c2 .\n(6)\n1 kpc\n\u03c3scatt =\n\nWe emphasize that rc in eq. (6) is the minimum size of a\nhalo core supported only by repulsion; a larger core radius\nis allowed for a given particle mass if the core is partly or\nentirely supported by random motions, as it must be for\nnon-interacting DM.\nNow, the Bullet Cluster bound was derived from Nbody simulations of classical particles with dynamics specified completely by gravity and contact collisions. Furthermore, the initial halo density profiles before the merger were\nKing profiles. Since the DM we consider here is bosonic, and\nour initial density profile does differ from the King profile,\nit is worth pausing to establish that Randall et al.'s bound\nreally does apply. In both their simulations and our model,\nthe probability of the ith particle's scattering is\nPi = \u03c1i \u03c3scatt vrel \u2206t.\n\n(7)\n\n\u03c1i is the local density, vrel the relative velocity between the\nith particle and its nearest neighbor, and \u2206t the time-step.\nFirst, consider the local density. As mentioned, in\nRandall et al. the initial conditions are that the two\nmerging components have King density profiles, \u03c1(r) =\n\u0002\n\u0003\u22123/2\n\u03c1(0) 1 + (r/rc )2\n, whereas our density profile is as in\nFigure 2. Two points defuse this concern. One, Randall et\nal. also simulate the collision of a King and a Hernquist\ndensity profile, leading them to claim their results are only\nweakly-dependent on the initial mass profiles. Two, the average density in our core is \u223c .6 that in the King core. This\nsuggests that the maximum allowed scattering cross section\nin our model would differ by an order unity factor from the\nbound quoted above at worst. As we will show, this bound\nwould have to be orders of magnitude greater than what it\nis to permit bosonic repulsive DM in thermal equilibrium.\nHence an order unity change in the bound would not alter\nour conclusion.\nNow, consider the relative velocity, which in our model\nmight be expected to differ from that in Randall et al.'s\nbecause in the core the DM is in a condensate governed\nby the Gross-Pitaevskii or non-linear Schr\u00f6dinger equation.\nHowever, as we note in \u00a75.3, there is a minimum DM particle mass for thermal equilibrium to have been reached by\nnow. This minimum mass implies the maximum thermal de\nBroglie wavelength possible for the DM particle is \u223c .5 km.\nThis is the scale on and below which quantum effects, such as\nthe macroscopic shared wave-function of the particles, governed by the GP Equation, become significant. Clearly, it\nis far smaller than what would be resolved by a simulation.\nHence, an N-body simulation of the DM we consider here\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n3\n\nwould not differ in this respect from Randall et al.'s-the\nGP Equation's dynamics would simply not be important on\na cosmological scale, except as encoded in the halo density\nprofile, an issue already dealt with above.\nStill on the subject of the relative velocity, it has been\npointed out that two interpenetrating streams of pure RDM\ncondensate will not scatter from one anotherpand dissipate\nif their relative velocity is less than vcrit = 2U0 \u03c1/m2 for\nthe same reasons as in a conventional superfluid (Goodman\n2000). Despite this, the Bullet Cluster constraint still applies. If K is chosen so that the minimum core radius of\na dwarf galaxy is \u223c 1 kpc, then the critical velocity there\nwill be comparable to the circular velocity at the edge of\nthe core, vc . 100 km s\u22121 . From these values of vc and rc ,\none infers a typical dark-matter density \u03c1c \u223c 20 mH cm\u22123\n(\u2248 0.5 M pc\u22123 ). The critical velocity in clusters will be\nlower because of the lower mass density, . 1 mH cm\u22123 .\nNow, Randall et al. estimate vrel for the Bullet Cluster\nas 4700 km s\u22121 , while Springel and Farrar (2007) estimate\n2860 km s\u22121 . Either is much larger than vcrit . Hence there is\nno question that the RDM particles will scatter each other,\nrather than the two merging components frictionlessly interpenetrating each other as would be the case were vrel < vcrit .\nIndeed, for vrel > vcrit , as it is here, it is likely that the coherent state of the particles would be destroyed; the DM would\nno longer be in a condensate. Nonetheless, subsequent to the\nmerger it might cool to reach gravitational equilibrium and\nin the process re-condense.\nFinally, our discussion would be incomplete without acknowledging several other upper bounds on \u03c3/m. Bradac\u0306 et\nal. (2008) use the merging cluster MACS J0025.4\u20131222 in\nsimilar fashion to the Bullet Cluster and obtain the orderof-magnitude estimate \u03c3/m < 4 cm2 g\u22121 . It is worth noting\nthat even were this looser limit used, it would still be too\nlow to permit bosonic repulsive DM in thermal equilibrium.\nOther more stringent limits are available, however. MiraldaEscud\u00e9 (2002) combines ellipticity measurements with the\nfact that DM collisions isotropize the DM's stress-energy\ntensor and hence lead to more spherical galaxies. He finds\n\u03c3/m < .018 cm2 g\u22121 . As we discuss in \u00a75.2, \u03c3/m must\nbe \u223c 1 cm2 g\u22121 to allow local and global thermodynamic\nequilibrium, which our work will require. Hence, if MiraldaEscud\u00e9's bound truly holds, it is an independent reason\nto doubt that DM can be in thermal equilibrium. Lin et\nal. (2011) present another bound also using the idea that\nonly limited isotropization is observationally acceptable; it\nis \u03c3/m < .0025 cm2 g\u22121 . This bound too offers reason to\ndoubt that DM can be in thermal equilibrium.\nNonetheless, given the uncertainties associated with\nlimits on DM's self-interaction cross section, in this paper\nwe have chosen to adopt the view that repulsive, bosonic\nDM in thermal equilibrium may still be possible, and must\nbe more fully considered before it can be decisively judged.\n2.3\n\nPressure\n\nOur main conclusions depend upon certain expected properties of the finite-temperature equation of state (hereafter\nEOS). Before presenting mathematical details, we address\nthe general physical regime that we expect for this hypothetical RDM gas.\nThe limits of \u00a72.2 imply that the interaction energy\n\n\f4\n\nSlepian and Goodman\n\nbetween any single pair of particles is \u001c mvc2 , vc being a\ncharacteristic virial or circular velocity. However, the total energy of interaction between a given particle and all\nof its neighbors is \u223c mvc2 in the core where repulsion balances gravity. To match observed rotation curves, the halo\nshould have an extended, approximately power-law envelope where the density is much lower than in the core. If the\ncollisionality, though weak, suffices to establish local thermal and hydrostatic equilibrium (\u00a75.2), the envelope must\nbe supported mainly by microscopic thermal motions rather\nthan the interparticle repulsion since the latter scales with\nthe density. Hence the temperature in the envelope must be\nvirial, kb T \u223c mvc2 . We take the temperature of the gas to be\nthe same in the halo as in the envelope. This is done partly\nfor simplicity, but the limits above imply that the collisional\nmean-free path is comparable to the size of the galaxy, if not\nlarger, so thermal conduction should be efficient. Finally,\nthe repulsive interaction has a very short range, because we\nassume that it derives from a momentum-independent quartic potential of a complex scalar field. This range is much\nsmaller than the thermal de Broglie wavelength\nh\n\u039bdB \u2261 \u221a\n,\n(8)\n2\u03c0mkB T\nwhich in turn is much smaller than galactic scales unless the\nparticle is extremely light.\nWith these assumptions, the RDM should behave as a\nnearly ideal boson gas, a type of system that has been studied extensively in connection with superfluidity and BoseEinstein condensates. At least to first order in perturbation theory, the short-range two-body repulsion can be represented by a contact potential U0 \u03b4 (3) (r 1 \u2212 r 2 ) described\nby the single parameter U0 , or equivalently, the \"scattering\nlength\"\nmU0\n.\n(9)\n4\u03c0~2\nThis is not to be confused with the collisional mean-free\npath, which depends on density. In the first-Born approximation, l = (\u03c3scatt /8\u03c0)1/2 . The weakness of the individual\npairwise interactions is expressed by l \u001c \u039bdB .\nEven with the idealization of a contact potential, the\nthermodynamics of a boson gas has not been solved exactly.\nProukakis & Jackson (2008, hereafter PJ) review many of\nthe approximations that have been used. The one we have\nadopted is what PJ call \"Hartree-Fock\" (HF). In this approximation, the gas is described by the occupation numbers\nof single-particle states-in our case, plane-wave momentum states, since \u039bdB is much smaller than scales on which\nthe density or pressure varies. The grand-canonical partition\nfunction and pressure are derived semiclassically along lines\nsimilar to textbook derivations for a non-interacting boson\ngas. Some tricks are used to incorporate the interactions, as\ndetailed in Appendix A.\nAt a given temperature T and particle mass m, the\ncritical density above which the condensate appears in a\nnon-interacting gas is2\n\u0012 \u0013\n3\n\u22123\n\u039b\u22123\n(10)\n\u03bdcrit = \u03b6\ndB \u2248 2.6 \u039bdB ,\n2\nl=\n\n2 We use \u03bd for number per unit volume and reserve n for mode\noccupation number.\n\ni.e. approximately one particle per cubic de Broglie wavelength. In our HF approximation, the critical density for\nthe condensate is also given by eq. (10).\nThe HF equation of state behaves as expected in highly\ndegenerate and dilute limits, respectively \u03bd \u001d \u03bdcrit and \u03bd \u001c\n\u03bdcrit . In the dilute limit, one recovers the pressure of an\nideal gas because the repulsion becomes negligible. In the\nopposite limit, the HF approximation gives the polytropic\nequation of state P = K\u03c12 , as does every approximation\nthat is consistent with the Gross-Pitaevskii equation (41).\nThe HF approximation is least accurate in an intermediate regime where the condensate is present and the repulsive and thermal energies per excitation are comparable,\n\u03bdU0 \u223c kb T (see Pethick & Smith 2002). In such cases, the\nthermal excitations are not well described by single particles but rather by collective oscillations-quasiparticles. The\ndispersion relation for these excitations is eq. (42), which\nfollows from linearisation of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation\n(41). It can be shown that our HF approximation effectively\nreplaces eq. (42) with (neglecting the gravitational term)\n(~k)2\n.\n(11)\n2m\nIf this were correct, there would be a minimum energy for\nthe excitations (viz. \u03bdU0 ) even at zero momentum, whereas\nthe more correct relation (42) shows that the excitations\nwith wavenumber k \u001c 2mcs /~ \u2261 ks behave as phonons-\nquantized\nsound waves-with effective sound speed cs =\np\n\u03bdU0 /m. These phonons are not conserved: they are excited and damped by 3-mode nonlinear interactions that are\nnot part of our HF approximation (which does however incorporate particle-conserving 4-mode interactions).\nIn order to assess the consequences of neglecting the\nquasiparticles for our equation of state, it is useful to introduce a dimensionless parameter that compares the repulsive\nand thermal energies at the critical density:\n~\u03c9k = \u03bdU0 +\n\n\u03b8=\n\nU0 \u03bdcrit\nl\n= 2\u03b6( 32 )\n.\nkB T\n\u039bdB\n\n(12)\n\nThe limits on collisionality from the Bullet Cluster imply\nthat \u03b8 \u001c 1; in fact, using eqs.

One finds that Pph 6 P0 when\n\u03bd & 2.0 \u03b8\u22125/7 \u03bdcrit .3 For \u03b8 \u001c 1, this minimum is lower than\nthe density at which eq. (15) is valid. That means that for\nany density for which the thermal excitations are more like\nphonons than free particles (and the latter are already dealt\nwith in our HF approximation), the pressure due to them\nwill be less than the pressure of the unexcited condensate.\nIn other words, the thermal contribution to the pressure is\ndominated by quasiparticles rather than \"free\" particles only\nwhen the density is so high that the total pressure is wellapproximated by the zero-temperature relation P = K\u03c12\nanyway.\nIn summary, since \u03b8 must be small to satisfy the Bullet\nCluster constraint (see eq. (14)), we may neglect the quasiparticles and use the HF approximation of Appendix A to\ncalculate the pressure as a function of density and temperature in RDM halos.\nAfter these preliminaries, we now present our approximate equation of state in terms of a scaled pressure P\u0302 =\nP/\u03bdcrit kB T , a scaled total number density \u03bd\u0302 = \u03bd/\u03bdcrit , and\na scaled number density in the condensate \u03bd\u03020 = \u03bd0 /\u03bdcrit .

(17).\nA log-log plot of the equation of state (eq. (16)) is shown\nin Figure 1 for \u03b8 = 1, corresponding to strong scattering (although the steps leading to eq. (16) cannot be justified unless\n\u03b8 \u001c 1) and for \u03b8 = 10\u22124 , corresponding to moderately weak\nscattering. The condensate is absent along the red section,\nand present along the blue. The part of the curve beneath\nthe dashed line segment is unphysical; it can be shown that\nthe integral of P\u0302 d\u03bd\u0302 vanishes when taken around the loop defined by the dashed segment and the unphysical lobe below\nit. The endpoints of the dashed segment define two phases in\ncontact, and the density jump at the phase transition scales\n\u221d \u03b8 when \u03b8 \u001c 1. The actual phase transition is rather weak\nin the weakly interacting regime (\u03b8 \u001c 1) where our equation\nof state is valid.\nWe know from the discussion above that this equation\nof state is only approximate. What matters for the computation of halo rotation curves, however, is the following\n\n3\n\nThe numerical constant is actually [8\u03c0 11 /(45\u03b6(3/2))2 ]1/7 .\n\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\nFigure 1. A log-log plot of scaled pressure P\u0302 \u2261 P/\u03bdcrit kB T versus scaled number density \u03bd\u0302 \u2261 \u03bd/\u03bdcrit for interaction strengths\n\u03b8 = 1 and \u03b8 = 10\u22124 (eq. (16)). The red curve is when no condensate is present, and the blue curve (only that to the right of\nand above the dashed line for \u03b8 = 1) is when the condensate is\npresent. For \u03b8 = 1, the loop below the dashed line is unphysical:\nas the pressure increases beginning around log10 P\u0302 = .2, the density experiences a large jump. For \u03b8 = 10\u22124 , the pressure barely\nvaries over a large range in density; this leads to the sudden drop\nin the density profile seen in Figure 2.\n\nproperty that the foregoing assures us is shared by the exact\nEOS: when \u03b8 \u001c 1, the pressure supplied by the condensate\nis very small at the critical density compared to the pressure\nsupplied by the non-degenerate component, and the latter\nis approximately that of a non-interacting gas. Therefore, as\nthe pressure increases by a modest factor above its value at\n\u03bdcrit -as it doubles, for example-the density must increase\nby a large factor \u223c \u03b8\u22121/2 . This property of the EOS, together with the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium, leads\nto a large jump in dark-matter density near the edge of the\ndegenerate core.\n\n3\n\nDENSITY PROFILES FOR AN\nISOTHERMAL SPHERICAL HALO\n\nUsing the equation of state, we solve the equations of hydrostatic equilibrium\nGMr \u03c1\ndP\n=\u2212\ndr\nr2\n\n(19)\n\n\f6\n\nSlepian and Goodman\n\nand\ndMr\n= 4\u03c0\u03c1r2\n(20)\ndr\nThe isothermal spherical halo we obtain thereby is the simplest model for a dark matter halo in virial equilibrium that\nhas the correct flat rotation curve asymptotically. At large\nradii where the density is sufficiently small, the pressure\nP \u2192 \u03bdkb T = \u03c1kb T /m, so that the solution tends to a classical isothermal sphere:\nkb T \u22122\nr ,\nand\n2\u03c0Gm\nGMr\n2kb T\n2\n\u2192\n\u2261 vc,\u221e\nas r \u2192 \u221e .\n(21)\nr\nm\nThis will provide an asymptotically flat rotation curve with\namplitude vc,\u221e . Within the core (r < rc ), the condensate\ndominates, and the density profile is similar to that for an\nn = 1 Emden polytrope. This is unsurprising because for\na pure condensate the equation of state is just that for an\nn = 1 polytrope. The inferred contribution of dark halos\nto the rotation curves of observed galaxies leads us to expect that the asymptotic velocity vc,\u221e should be within a\nfactor \u223c 2 of the circular velocity vc at the edge of the\ncore (eq. (3)). This connects the temperature-or more precisely, the ratio T /m-to the sound speed at the center\nof the degenerate core, which depends in our model only\nupon the zero-temperature limit of the equation of state:\nc2s (0) = 2K\u03c1(0). At intermediate radii however, as can be\nseen from Figure 2, the density profile and circular velocity\nare quite different from the classical isothermal sphere and\ndepend strongly on the interaction parameter \u03b8.\nAll models shown are scaled to the same central density,\ncore radius and asymptotic rotation velocity or velocity dispersion; this demands that the scaled central number density\n\u03bd\u0302(0) = C\u03b8\u22121 , C a constant. The reason for this is as follows.\nThe physical central density \u03c1(0) = m\u03bdcrit \u03bd\u0302(0). Eliminating\n\u03bdcrit in favor of \u03b8 via eq. (12), U0 in favor of rc2 via eq. (2),\n2\nand finally kb T /m via eq. (21) yields \u03c1(0) = (\u03c0vc,\u221e\n/8Grc2 )C.\n2\n2\nOn the other hand, \u03c1(0) = (\u03c0vc /4Grc ) from eq. (3). Thus\nthe asymptotic circular velocity is related to p\nthe circular velocity at the edge of the core by vc,\u221e = vc 2/C. Typical\ndwarf-galaxy rotation profiles suggest that vc,\u221e should be\nmodestly greater than vc , so we set C = 1. We thus have a\nfamily of density profiles that depends only on \u03b8, the interaction strength of the RDM, as demonstrated by Figure 2.\nPerhaps surprisingly, it is the most strongly interacting\nmodel (\u03b8 = 1) that most closely resembles the classical case.\nAt \u03b8 \u001c 1, the density drops sharply outside the core,\u221aby\na factor \u223c \u03b8. It is then nearly constant out to r \u2248 rc / \u03b8.\nThis occurs because, as discussed in \u00a72.3, the pressure of\nthe condensate is proportional to \u03b8(\u03bd/\u03bdcrit )2 ; the condensate would not contribute to the pressure at all if \u03b8 = 0 (a\nnoninteracting gas). In the limit \u03b8 = 0, the pressure of the\nnon-degenerate component, and therefore the total pressure,\nis independent of density once \u03bd > \u03bdcrit ; increases in density\nmerely increase the fraction of the particles in the condensate. If \u03b8 is small, the density must increase above \u03bdcrit by a\nfactor \u223c \u03b8\u22121/2 in order to double the pressure. Hence in hydrostatic equilibrium, a very large increase in density must\noccur over a small range in radius at the edge of the region\nwhere the condensate exists. The structure of the low-\u03b8 halos in Fig. 2 is reminiscent of a red giant, where the central\n\u03c1(r) \u2192\n\nFigure 2.

Notice the severe drops in the density profile for\n\u03b8 \u001c 1; these come from the small change in pressure over a large\nrange in density we point out in Figure 1, and lead to the constraint that \u03b8 > 10\u22124 for realistic rotation curves.\n\nparts are supported by degeneracy pressure and there is a\ndistended envelope due to the large entropy increase across\nthe hydrogen-burning shell.\nThis density drop is a key feature of our model because\nit leads to a dip in the rotation curve at the edge of the\ncore. For \u03b8 = 10\u22124 , the velocity dips by a factor \u223c 2, and\nfor smaller values of \u03b8 the dip is even more pronounced. Such\nfeatures appear to conflict with the inferred contribution of\ndark matter to galactic rotation curves. Therefore, if RDM\nhalos really were isothermal, we would surely require \u03b8 >\n10\u22124 .\nRequiring \u03b8 > 10\u22124 leads to a lower bound on\nthe mass of the RDM particle.4 Replacing (2kb T /m)1/2\nwith the asymptotic circular velocity (21) yields \u039bdB \u2248\n\u221a\n4\u03c0~/mvc,\u221e , which we insert into the definition (12) of \u03b8.\nWe relate l in that equation to U0 via eq.

For a detailed\nreview of the history of work on astrophysical-scale bosonic\nobjects, e.g. boson stars (first proposed by Kaup (1968) and\nRuffini & Bonazzola (1969)), as well as galactic halos (first\nsuggested by Baldeschi et al. (1983)), we refer the reader to\nChavanis 2011. Here, we review what is necessary to contextualize our own work.\nAs Chavanis notes, Baldeschi et al. considered the possibility that DM halos might be composed of a non-degenerate\ncomponent and a condensate. However, in this model and\nsubsequent studies (e.g. Sin 1994), the possibility of selfinteraction was ignored. Many scalar field models (Schunck\n1998, Matos & Guzman 1999, see Chavanis 2011 for further discussion) were proposed that also assumed no selfinteraction. These models all required small masses (m \u223c\n10\u221224 eV/c2 ) to achieve a sufficiently large core radius\nin agreement with observation. To avoid this \"unnaturally\nsmall mass,\" self-interaction was proposed: see Colpi et al.\n1986, Lee & Koh 1996, and Arbey et al. 2003, as well as the\nreferences mentioned in the Introduction.\nGoodman (2000) pointed out that\np this would lead to\na minimum halo core size rc = 3 U0 /4\u03c0Gm2 , and Lee\n& Lim (2010) show that there is also a minimum mass,\nMmin ' ~2 /G\u03bbc m2 , with \u03bbc the DM particle's Compton\nwavelength. Rindler-Daller & Shapiro (2010) observe that\nvortices should form for a strongly self-interacting condensate, and that this may affect the density profile (2011).\nBohmer & Harko (2007) pick up where Goodman left off and\ncalculate rotation curves for a repulsive, completely BoseEinstein condensed halo, noting that the gravitational lensing prediction differs from CDM. However, as Chavanis comments, they ignore the quantum pressure, i.e. the additional\npressure due to Heisenberg uncertainty. Chavanis therefore\nconnects the non-interacting (but including quantum pressure) limit of Ruffini & Bonazzola (1969) with the interacting (but no quantum pressure) limit studied by Bohmer &\nHarko (2007), taking into account both the quantum pressure and a repulsive (or attractive) self-interaction.5 Chavanis obtains both analytical (paper I) and numerical (paper II) mass profiles and rotation curves. However, his work\ndoes not treat the case where the DM has a non-zero temperature and there are both condensed and non-condensed\ncomponents present. This is the gap our paper fills.\nWe would note that it is an important gap because as\nit turns out, the presence of a non-condensed component is\nwhat leads to the abrupt density drop in the halo profile\n(see Figure 2). This abrupt drop in turn leads to unrealistic\nrotation curves and so places a lower bound on the collisionality of the RDM (lower collisionality implies a steeper\ndensity drop). It is the combination of this constraint with\n\n5\n\nWe neglect the quantum pressure because for it to be significant\nwould require a mass so small as to have a Compton wavelength\ncomparable to the core radius (m \u223c h/rc vc \u223c 10\u221222 eV), as with\nHu et al.'s (2000) \"fuzzy dark matter.\" This would be the type\nof \"unnaturally small mass\" that self-interaction was originally\nintroduced to avoid.\n\n\f8\n\nSlepian and Goodman\n\nthat the Bullet Cluster places on the scattering cross section\nthat allows us to rule out repulsive, bosonic dark matter in\nthermal equilibrium. Hence we can conclude that the effects\nof non-zero temperature are in fact critical to understanding\nthe behavior of a bosonic, repulsive DM model in thermal\nequilibrium.\n\n5.2\n\nThermal Equilibrium\n\nBefore closing, there are four issues we should briefly address. First, as we noted in the Introduction, the conclusion we have presented can be avoided if the DM has not\nreached thermal equilibrium either locally or globally. For\nour equation of state to be valid, we require local thermodynamic equilibrium, reached via collisions on a timescale\ntcoll \u223c \u03bbmfp /vc . For our isothermal halo models to be valid,\nwe also require global thermodynamic equilibrium, reached\nvia conduction on a timescale tcond \u223c r2 /vc \u03bbmfp , where r is\nthe radius of the DM halo and we estimate r \u223c rc . So unless\ntcoll and tcond are both much less than the Hubble time tH0 ,\nour halo models are invalid, in which case so is the constraint\neq. (23), as it comes from demanding that the drop in the\nhalo density profile not be too steep.\nIf \u03c3scatt /m \u2248 1 cm2 g\u22121 (near the upper end of the\nrange allowed by the Bullet Cluster), then r \u223c \u03bbmfp in the\nsolar neighborhood, and tcoll \u223c tcond \u001c tH0 so we have both\nlocal and global thermodynamic equilibrium. But if \u03c3scatt /m\nwere significantly smaller than this value, the dark matter\nwould not undergo sufficient scattering to reach local thermodynamic equilibrium (i.e. tcoll > tH0 ). This would invalidate our equation of state, and place us effectively in the\nlimit of a non-interacting, axion-like particle. There would\nbe one salient difference from the non-interacting axion even\nin this regime, however: the collective repulsion could still\nprovide a core, since as we have pointed out earlier, the collisionality and minimum core size are independent. In short,\nin this limit, the upper bound eq. (6) on the mass still applies, but the lower bound eq. (23) does not.\n\n5.3\n\nSupporting the degenerate core\n\nSecond, we reiterate here that there is no conflict between\na small interaction parameter \u03b8 and a large core, rc \u001d \u039bdB ,\nbecause the de Broglie wavelength, core radius, and interaction parameter depend upon the particle mass m and scattering length l in different combinations. From eq. (12) we\nhave that \u03b8 \u223c l/\u039bdB . (To avoid distraction from the important scalings dimensionless factors of order unity are suppressed here.) The temperature T of the hypothetical RDM\nis not observable, but kb T /m \u223c vc2 is observable, vc being\na characteristic circular velocity. Thus \u039bdB \u223c h/mvc and\n\u03b8 \u223c mlvc /h. On the other hand, eliminating U0 from the\ncore radius (2) in favor of the scattering length (9) gives\nrc \u223c (~2 l/Gm3 )1/2 . So at a fixed value of vc , we have\n\u039bdB \u221d m\u22121 , \u03b8 \u221d ml, and rc \u221d l1/2 m\u22123/2 . Eliminating the\nscattering length between these relations and including the\nnumerical factors produces eq. (22), which clearly shows that\none can have an arbitrarily small \u03b8 at any given rc for sufficiently small particle mass.\nIf the mass were as small as h/rc vc \u223c 10\u221222 eV/c2 , then\nthe de Broglie length would be comparable to the core ra-\n\ndius; for masses smaller than this, the core would be supported by \"quantum pressure\" even without repulsive interactions. However, as eq. (6) and the discussion in \u00a75.2\nindicate, the scattering cross section is insufficient to establish thermal equilibrium at galactic densities over a Hubble\ntime if the particle mass is much smaller than 10\u22123 eV/c2 .\nThus there is a wide range of masses-some 19 orders of\nmagnitude-over which the cores of galaxies could be supported by repulsion rather than a large de Broglie wavelength and yet two-body collisions would be totally ineffective at thermalizing their distribution. This regime, however,\nis not the main focus of the present paper.\n\n5.4\n\nVortices\n\nThird, we consider whether the vortex formation RindlerDaller & Shapiro (hereafter RDS) (2010) claim will occur in\nstrongly self-interacting Bose-Einstein condensed DM would\npossibly change the rotation curve (RDS 2011) in a way to\navoid the constraint we use here.\nSome care is required. RDS (2011) derive two constraints that both must be independently satisfied for vortices to form: a minimum mass, and a minimum interaction\nstrength. At first blush, we might take the minimum mass of\neq. (23) and ask whether it exceeds their required minimum.\nHowever, this approach would be subtly flawed: the\nminimum mass of eq. (23) is based on the observationally\ndisallowed density profile it would produce. But this density\nprofile assumes no vortices are present. Hence, the minimum mass it implies is not the correct lower bound if vortices form. Indeed, if vortices form, they would form only\nin the condensate core of the halo, and lower the density\nthere while minimally affecting the non-degenerate envelope's density.6 So at a given \u03b8, the \"cliff\" in the density\nwould be smoothed out-thus allowing a lower minimum\nvalue of \u03b8 to be consistent with observation than if vortices\nare not considered. Since m \u221d \u03b81/4 from eq. (22), this would\nlower the minimum allowed mass of eq. (23).\nIndeed, it is worthwhile to ask just how much vortices\ncould lower this minimum allowed mass of eq. (23). In particular, could they lower it enough so that it became less\nthan the maximum mass of eq. (6), thereby saving repulsive\ndark matter in thermal equilibrium from being ruled out by\nthe mismatch of these constraints? To get the constraints to\nmatch would require lowering the lower bound eq. (23) by\na factor of 10\u22125 , and hence \u03b8 by a factor of 10\u221220 . So the\nvortices would have to deplete the core density enough that\na density profile corresponding to \u03b8 ' 10\u221224 was observationally allowed.\nEven with the mass lower by a factor of 10\u22125 , \u039bdB \u001c rc ,\nso the contribution of quantum pressure to supporting the\ncore would still be negligible. Thus the core would still need\nto be supported by repulsion alone. But \u03b8 > 10\u22129 is required\nto fulfill this condition. So if the vortices could deplete the\n\n6\n\nRDS's work is motivated by the fact that vortices form in BEC's\nproduced in the laboratory (see e.g. Madison et al. 2000); there\nis no reason to expect them to form in the non-degenerate component of the halo. The change in the density of the core would\naffect the gravitational potential experienced by the outer, nondegenerate envelope, but this effect would be at 2nd order.\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n\fRuling Out Bosonic Repulsive Dark Matter in Thermal Equilibrium\ncore's density sufficiently to make our lower bound on m\nconsistent with our upper bound, we would lose the degenerate core, the feature that motivated considering repulsive\nbosonic DM in the first place! In short, then, the presence of\nvortices will not affect our conclusion that repulsive bosonic\nDM in thermal equilibrium is observationally ruled out.\nFor the sake of completeness, we now deal with the\nquestion of whether vortices will indeed form. The minimum\nmass for which our model can be valid is m \u223c 10\u22123 eV/c2\n(see \u00a75.3). This is larger than the largest minimum mass\nRDS 2011 requires for vortex formation, m ' 10\u221221 eV/c2 .7\nUsing eq. (2) to relate U0 to m and rc , the minimum value of\nU0 (which occurs at the minimum mass computed above) is\nU0 ' 10\u221222 eV cm3 . This is stronger than the largest minimum required repulsion of 2 \u00d7 10\u221258 eV cm3 . Thus, vortices\nwill form as long as the ancillary assumptions (e.g., non-zero\nspin parameter \u03bb) made by RDS 2011 are satisfied.\nHowever, it should be borne in mind that, as we have\nshown above, were vortices to form, if they depleted the core\ndensity enough to evade the conflicting bounds we place on\nthe DM particle's mass, the observationally-required core\nwould disappear. Thus, to reiterate, they do not affect our\nconclusion that repulsive bosonic DM in thermal equilibrium\nis observationally ruled out. Nonetheless, one might worry\nthat if a vortex forms precisely at the center of the halo,\nthen the scaling we have used throughout, \u03bd\u0302(0)\u03b8 = C \u2261 1\n(see \u00a73) would be invalid, as the density at the center of the\nvortex (and hence halo) would be zero. In response to this,\nit must be observed that the vortex will be quite small. Its\nsize is given by the healing length, \u03be (see RDS 2011, Fetter\n& Foot 2012 for details):\n~\n~\n\u03be= \u221a\n\u2248\n' .6 m,\nmvc\n2U0 \u03c1\n\n(24)\n\nwhere we have used the definition of vcrit and then that\nvcrit ' vc to obtain the second and third equalities. Hence\nany vortex would be minuscule. In any case, were a vortex\npresent at the center of the halo, one might simply replace\nour \u03bd\u0302(0) with h\u03bd\u0302(r < rs )i, with rs some smoothing length\ndefining a sphere over which the average density (denoted\nby the angle brackets) is taken.\n\n5.5\n\nDrag on a rotating galactic bar\n\nFinally, we consider the drag on a rotating galactic bar in\nour model. Since we have argued that bosonic repulsive dark\nmatter in thermal equilibrium should be ruled out, this discussion is of secondary importance.

(16)-(18) has the expected behavior at\nboth extremes of the degeneracy parameter \u03bd/\u03bdcrit (T ). The\nHartree-Fock approximation is that the boson gas can be\ndescribed in terms of occupation numbers of single-particle\nstates, and the discussion below reflects this viewpoint-\nwhich, however, is not accurate at intermediate densities\nwhere quasiparticles dominate, as discussed in \u00a72.3.\nWhen T = 0, all of the DM particles will be in the\nlowest-energy state, corresponding to a pure Bose-Einstein\ncondensate. This is evident from the fact that \u03bdcrit \u221d T 3/2 ,\nso that \u03bdcrit \u2192 0 as T \u2192 0. The equation of state should\nreduce to the one given in \u00a72.1, P = K\u03c12 = U0 \u03bd02 /2, which\nfollows from the fact that there are n2 /2 pairs per unit volume and that the energy per pair is U0 \u03b4(r 1 \u2212 r 2 ). The constant U0 in P corresponds to the \"bare\" interaction only to\nfirst order; at higher orders in perturbation theory it must\nbe renormalized.\nIn the argument of the polylogarithm in eq. (38),\n\u03bcnd \u2212 U0 \u03bd, with \u03bd = \u03bd0 , simplifies to \u2212U0 \u03bd n\u03040 /N , clearly\nindependent of T . Thus that quantity remains negative as\nT \u2192 0. \u03b2 \u2192 \u221e as T \u2192 0, so the argument of the polylogarithm in eq. (38) becomes zero. The term multiplying\nit, \u03b2 \u22121 \u03b6( 32 ), also \u0001goes to zero. So the pressure becomes\nP = U0 \u03bd 2 \u2212 12 \u03bd02 . Since \u03bd = \u03bd0 because all of the DM is\nin the condensate, this reduces to P = U0 \u03bd02 /2 as required.\nIn the limit that U0 \u2192 0, the gas is non-interacting and\nshould approach an ideal gas of indistinguishable bosons.\nFor a given \u03bd, if T is such that \u03bd 6 \u03bdcrit , there will be no\ncondensate, and the chemical potential \u03bcnd , which governs\nparticles' transition from the ground state to excited states,\nis determined by inverting eq. (36) (\u03bd 6 \u03bdcrit ). Taking U0 = 0\nand rewriting the second term in eq. (38) using eq. (36)\n(\u03bd 6 \u03bdcrit ), we have\n\u0002 \u03b2\u03bc \u0003\nnd\n\u22121 Li5/2 e\n.\n(39)\nP =\u03b2 \u03bd\nLi3/2 [e\u03b2\u03bcnd ]\n\n\f12\n\nSlepian and Goodman\n\nThis agrees with standard results (e.g. Tolman 1938). For an\ninteracting gas in the dilute limit where the dimensionless\ncombination \u03b2U0 \u03bd \u2192 0+ , the same result (39) still obtains\n(note that U0 has dimensions of energy times volume).\nNow we consider T such that \u03bd > \u03bdcrit . In this case a\ncondensate will be present, so we can use eq. (32b) for \u03bcnd .\nWith U0 = 0, \u03bcnd = 0. As T \u2192 0+ , the argument of the\npolylogarithms in eqs. (36) (\u03bd > \u03bdcrit ) and (38) approaches\nunity, and the functions approach Riemann zeta functions.\nWe now replace the second term in eq. (38) using eq. (36)\n(\u03bd > \u03bdcrit ). These manipulations yield\n\u0001\n\u03b6 52\n\u22121\n\u0001.\nP = \u03b2 (\u03bd \u2212 \u03bd0 )\n(40)\n\u03b6 32\nNote that this result is what we would obtain if in\nour eq. (39) (or Tolman's 93.20) we took \u03bcnd = 0 and replaced \u03bd with \u03bd \u2212 \u03bd0 , which is justified because normally\nwhen a condensate appears the chemical potential in the\nnon-degenerate component is set to zero and only the nondegenerate component produces pressure. This is because\nparticles in the condensate have zero momentum down to\nquantum mechanical uncertainty (\u2206p0, min ' V \u22121/3 ~) and\nso should not contribute any pressure.\n\n9\n\nAPPENDIX B: DYNAMICAL FRICTION\n\nGoodman (2000) argued that the superfluidity of an RDM\ncondensate implies that there should be no dynamical friction on a moving potential, such as a galactic bar, insofar\nas the core of the\nphalo is dominated by the condensate and\nvbar < vcrit =\n2\u03bdU0 /m. Our current view is somewhat\ndifferent. In the limit that the scattering mean-free-path is\nlarge compared to the dimensions of the bar or the core, the\noriginal argument is perhaps correct. In the opposite limit,\nwhile it remains true that the dynamical friction vanishes\nbelow a critical speed \u223c vcrit , the reason is not because the\nRDM is a superfluid (although it is), but rather because it is\nsufficiently ideal fluid in the classical sense, i.e. the viscosity\ndue to collisions between particles and due to the thermal\nvelocity of the particles is negligible.\nThe important difference between a galactic bar interacting with DM gravitationally and a spoon dragged\nthrough a laboratory fluid is that the gravitational potential\nis smooth, whereas the spoon has a surface at which a no-slip\nboundary condition applies to the normal (non-superfluid)\ncomponent. Thus, even in laminar flow, the spoon exerts\na viscous force on the normal component that vanishes\nmore slowly than linearly with the viscosity, probably as\nthe Reynolds number Re\u22121/2 , because there is a laminar\nboundary layer. At moderately high Reynolds number, the\nboundary layer on the rear side of the spoon becomes unstable and contributes a turbulent drag that is asymptotically\nindependent of Re. For a smooth large-scale potential like\nthat of a rotating bar, there is no such surface and no such\nboundary layer, and therefore perhaps no turbulence. This\nabsence of drag would seem to hold even if the RDM had a\nsubstantial normal-fluid component.\nHowever, the bar or other moving potential may experience a wave drag if it couples to a wave whose phase velocity,\nwhether linear or angular, matches that of the potential itself. In a pure condensate, below vcrit , the only significant\n\n\u221a\nwaves are phonons at speed cs = 2K\u03c1, so that a linearly\nmoving potential experiences no wave drag if its velocity\nis subsonic, though a rotating bar could excite phonons at\nlarge radii where |r \u00d7 \u03a9bar | > cs . One can see this explicitly from the quantum-mechanical equation of motion\nfor the condensate wave function (Gross-Pitaevskii or nonlinear Schr\u00f6dinger equation):\ni~\n\n\u2202\u03a8\n~2 2\n=\u2212\n\u2207 \u03a8 + U0 |\u03a8|2 \u03a8 + (\u03a6self + \u03a6ext )\u03a8 ,\n\u2202t\n2m\n\n(41)\n\nin which \u03a6ext & \u03a6self are the gravitational potentials of the\nbar or other external perturber and of the condensate itself;\n\u03a6self satisfies Poisson's equation with the mass density \u03c1c =\nm|\u03a8|2 of the condensate as source.\nAdopting the usual Jeans swindle, consider perturbations to a background state of uniform density and vanishing\n\u03a6. The unperturbed wavefunction \u03a80 has a constant mod\u221a\nulus |\u03a80 | = \u03bd0 but a time-dependent phase, because the\nterm involving U0 in eq. (41) does not vanish in the background state. One sets \u03a8 \u2192 \u03a80 (t)[1 + \u03b5(r, t)] and expands\neq. (41) to first order in the real and imaginary parts of \u03b5,\ntreating \u03a6ext and \u03a6self as well as \u03b5 as first-order quantities.\nIn the unforced case \u03a6ext = 0, the dispersion relation for\nFourier modes \u03b5(~r, t) \u221d exp(i~k * ~r \u2212 i\u03c9t) becomes\n\u0012 2 \u00132\n~k\n,\n(42)\n\u03c9k2 = c2s k2 \u2212 4\u03c0Gm\u03bd +\n2m\np\nin which cs \u2261 \u03bdU0 /m plays the role of sound speed.\nChavanis (2011) also obtains this result. As usual with the\nGP Equation, the last term on the right represents singleparticle excitations; it is small for long-wavelength modes\nk \u001c 2mcs /~. If one neglects the term in k4 , then equation\n(42) matches the results of a Jeans analysis for a classical\nideal fluid, \u03c9 2 = c2s k2 \u22124\u03c0G\u03c1 (e.g. Binney & Tremaine 2008).\nThis conclusion can also be reached if one explicitly\ncomputes the drag force on a perturbing body. Consider a\nrigid perturbing potential that moves at constant velocity v\nthrough the condensate, \u03a6ext (~r \u2212 ~v t). If we write \u03a6\u0303ext (~k) for\nthe spatial Fourier transform of this potential at any time,\nthen after transients have decayed, the component of the\nwave drag along ~v is\n\u02c6\nd~k\n\u03c10\n\u03b4(\u03c9k \u2212 ~k * ~v )|~k\u03a6\u0303ext (~k)|2 ,\n(43)\nFdrag = \u2212\nV\n(2\u03c0)3\nwith \u03c10 \u2261 m\u03bd. Since\nthe Fourier components \u03a6\u0303ext (~k) are\n\u221a\nnegligible at k & 2mcs /~, this is effectively the same drag\nas for an ideal fluid with equation of state P = K\u03c12 . The\nquantum-mechanical nature of the condensate plays no direct role. To the extent that the self-gravity of the RDM is\nslight on the scale of the perturber, in other words \u03a6\u0303ext (~k)\nis unimportant for k2 . 4\u03c0G\u03c10 /c2s , the drag vanishes for\nsubsonic motion relative to the condensate.\nThe formal result (43) holds more generally for ideal fluids in which the dispersion relation may differ from eq. (42).\nThus it should hold even when the RDM has a normal (nondegenerate) component, as it must at finite temperature. In\na realistic case where the background state is not uniform,\nhowever, the RDM gas would be stratified, i.e. it would have\nan entropy gradient parallel to the background gravitational\nfield, so that waves restored by buoyancy (internal waves/\ng modes) might be excited at subsonic velocities. As we show\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n\fRuling Out Bosonic Repulsive Dark Matter in Thermal Equilibrium\nin \u00a73, an isothermal RDM halo at nonzero temperature consists of a core that is almost pure condensate, and has nearly\nthe n = 1 Emden profile, surrounded by an extended nondegenerate \"atmosphere,\" with a sharp cliff in the density\nprofile at the edge of the core (Fig. 2). Although we do not\ncalculate it here, the coupling of a sub-sonicly rotating bar\npotential to the g modes would probably occur mainly just\noutside the core, with a drag proportional to the density in\nthe non-degenerate component there. Since that density is\nmuch less than the central density, the drag on the bar for\na given mass-to-light ratio would be much less than what\nDebattista & Sellwood (2000) estimate for collisionless dark\nmatter. The pattern speeds of their simulated bars slow significantly from their maximum possible values-the values\nat which corotation with the local galactic circular velocity\noccurs near the end of the bar-in a few rotation periods.\nTypical pattern speeds of galactic bars are measured to\nbe \u03a9b . 60 km s\u22121 kpc\u22121 , corresponding to rotation periods\n2\u03c0\u03a9\u22121\n& 108 yr (Merrifield & Kuijken 1995; Gerssen et al.\nb\n1999; Hirota et al. 2009 and references therein). An n = 1\nEmden polytrope with central sound speed\np cs (0), radius rc ,\nand mass Mc has a circular velocity vc \u2261 GMc /rc = cs (0).\nThe slowest (fundamental) mode of such a polytrope with\nthe required quadrupolar symmetry (` = m = 2) has pattern\nspeed \u03c9c /2 = 0.616vc /rc , which is about the same as the\nmeasured bar speeds if vc = 100 km s\u22121 and rc = 1 kpc. If\n\u03a9b < \u03c9c /2, then the bar should not excite this mode, and\nthere should be no torque between the bar and the core.\nThere would probably still be a drag on the surrounding nondegenerate component, but without attempting to calculate\nthis explicitly, we expect by analogy with tidal excitation\nof g modes in stars (e.g. Goldreich & Nicholson 1989) that\nthe torque on that component would be suppressed by the\nratio of the maximum nondegenerate density to the central\ndensity of the core, a factor \u223c \u03b8 \u001c 1.\n\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n13\n\n\f"}
