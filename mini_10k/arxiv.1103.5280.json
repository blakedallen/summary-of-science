Finite\nsize effects, resulting from the thinning of wires, on the structural stability and electronic\nproperties is an interesting topic for study. Yanson et al.1 and Ohnishi et al.2 showed\nexperimentally that gold NWs fabricated between the two electrodes during the thinning\nprocess transform successively from quadruple to linear strands. The conductance quanta\nin these NWs changed from 4 to 1 Go (where, Go = 2e2 /h). They also found that the (111)\nand (100) atomic sheets had a stable structure and deformation of the atomic sheets lead\nto an increase in the conductance. Theoretically, a first systematic investigation in NWs of\ngold was performed by Sanchez-Portal et al.,3,4 where-in, the authors observed that zigzag\nNWs were more stable than single atomic chains (SAC) and other nano-structures. It is\nwell known from Peirel's argument,5 that SAC would be less stable than either bi-atomic\nchains (BAC) or zigzag structures. Hence, zigzag structures contributed a important finding\nin Sanchez-Portal's paper. More recently, F. Tavazza et al.6,7 have performed a relatively\nmore detailed theoretical investigation of gold wires under tensile stress and strain. They\nobserved that gold wires elongate to form single atom chains (SAC) just before fracture via a\nseries of intermediate structural transformations. The authors investigated seven structures\nas a starting point and investigated evolution of these into single atom chains under tensile\nstrain. The authors also observed 2D structures are energetically more favorable than 3D\nstructures. However, this study was limited only to the stability of structures under stress\nand strain. There are no reports in literature on detailed investigations into the electronic\norigins of quantum conductance of wires different than linear.\nMost of the theoretical and experimental investigations published so far are limited largely\nto structural stability and the measurement of conductance in gold NWs pulled from atomic\ntips.8\u201314 Furthermore most of the investigations are limited to single or double rows of gold\nNWs. The short length (4-5 atoms) and double row chains have limited potential for practical\napplications in comparison with somewhat longer atomic chains. A further drawback of\ninvestigations performed on NWs suspended in tips is that tips may not be implementable\nin functional devices. Structural stability of longer NWs under device operating conditions\nand with respect to the likely atomic processes happening at these temperatures, however\n\n2\n\n\fwill play an important role in the integration of NWs in various technologies.\nIn the present paper, we intend to investigate stability of infinitely long gold NWs and\nconcomitant quantum conductance in the wires from a detailed theoretical perspective. We\nhave investigated the stability of two dimensional (2D) ribbon like gold NWs of different\nshapes with increasing number of rows. Besides the geometrical structure, the electronic\nstructure has been analyzed to understand the correlation between the structure, stability\nand conductivity in these wires. Our results show that in the nanoregime the electronic\ncontributions have an important role in determining the stability and conductivity of the\nNWs. We discuss the increased stability of (111) oriented NWs over (100) NWs based on\nthe contributions of p electrons. All previous investigations on conductivity in NWs are\nlimited to measuring the conductance, however, the electronic origins of conductance have\nnot been investigated in detail.\nWe believe, this study will aid further systematic investigations into the effect of different\nalloying elements on the stability, conductivity and other physical properties of these and\nsimilar NWs, an area yet unexplored extensively. Such investigations especially related with\nNWs composed of magnetic and non-magnetic elements may reveal novel magnetic and\nconducting properties. The organization of the paper is as follows. In the next section,\nwe describe the technical details of our simulations on the gold NWs. In Sec. III, we\ndescribe our results on the geometric structure and discuss the stability of the NWs based\non their electronic structure. The correlation between electronic structure and conductivity\nis discussed in Sec. IV followed by a brief summary of the main results in Sec. V.\n\nII.\n\nCOMPUTATIONAL METHOD\n\nWe have performed total energy calculations based on ab intio density functional theory\n(DFT) as implemented in the Vienna ab initio Simulation Package(VASP).15\u201317 The Projector Augmented Wave method (PAW)18 and Generalized Gradient Approximation (GGA)19\nhas been used to describe electron-ion interactions and exchange correlation interactions.\nThe NWs are modeled in a periodically repeated unit cell, whose dimensions are chosen in\nsuch a way that the wires are infinite and periodic in the x direction with 12 \u00c5 vacuum\nspacing in y and z directions. A plane-wave energy cut-off of 229.9 eV (13.2 Ry) was used.\nThe energy convergence of linear wire was tested with respect to the number of k-points\n3\n\n\fused for integrating the Brillouin Zone. A 13 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 1 mesh of k-points in the Monkhorst\nPack scheme gave reasonable convergence in the total energy. The same mesh of k-points has\nbeen used for all other structures. Atomic relaxations are performed by conserving the shape\nand volume of the unit cell. The NW structures have been optimized using the Residual\nMinimization (RMM-DIIS)20 method and the Conjugate gradient (CG)21,22 method. The\nstructural optimizations have been performed until the total forces on individual atoms are\nless than 0.01 eV/\u00c5. The binding energy per atom (EB ) for gold NWs is calculated as\n[ET \u2212 nEatom ]\nEB =\nn\nwhere, ET is the total energy of the NW, Eatom is the energy of single gold atom and n is\nthe total number of atoms.\nIn order to understand the electronic and conduction properties of the NWs, we have\nperformed band structure calculations. For the linear wire, the Brillouin zone integration has\nbeen performed from \u0393(0,0,0) to X(0.5,0,0) direction with 10 equidistant kpoints. Except\nfor the linear wire, all other geometries are two dimensional. Considering this, the two\ndimensional Brillouin zone has been integrated along \u0393(0,0,0) to X(0.5,0.5,0)- direction using\n10 equidistant kpoints. In order to understand the contributions of the electrons in the s, p\nand d states to the energy levels in the band structure, the 'fat band technique' was applied.\nThe technique has been developed and implemented by Jepsen et al.23 in the LMTO-ASA\ntight binding method. We have developed a similar technique in VASP by giving a width to\nthe electronic energy band that is proportional to the sum of the corresponding orthonormal\norbital(s). The details of the technique of the 'fat band method' with VASP package are\ndescribed in V. Kashid et al.24 We have also performed spin polarized DFT calculations for\nthe infinite NW geometries. These calculations show that infinite NWs are non-magnetic in\nnature.\nThe conducting properties of gold NWs are investigated based on the Landuaer-B\u00fcttiker\nformalism,25 using the method of plane waves,26 For each nanowire, the conductance is\ncalculated as\n2e2\nT (E)\nh\nwhere, T(E) is the transmission function at a particular energy and calculated as\nG(E) =\n\nT (E) = N (E),\n4\n\n\fHere, N (E) are number of states. The number of states can be directly obtained from the\nband structure of the gold NWs.\n\nIII.\nA.\n\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nStructure\n\nStructural optimizations were performed on fourteen different structures of gold nanowires\nwith 1-5 rows of atoms. Except for the linear (LR) nanowire, all other NWs studied are\ntwo dimensional, with increasing number of rows of Au atoms, in one of the non-periodic\ndirections. Amongst 14 unconstrained NW structures we investigated, some structures have\nbeen previously reported in the literature. The linear NW has been studied in great detail\nas free standing3,4,13,27,28 as well as suspended between tips.6\u20138,10,29,30 Unconstrained structures like zigzag (ZZ), rectangular (RT-1), parallelogram (PR-1) and double zigzag (DZZ)\nstructures have also been investigated by other researchers.3,4,27,29,31 More recently, Tavazza\net al. have found that 2D structures like ZZ, PR-1, PR-2, DZZ and centered hexagonal\n(CHX) are formed intermediately during the thinning process.7\nWe optimized all the NW geometries by varying the bond lengths between the gold\natoms in the periodic direction. Figure 1 shows the structures of NWs investigated. The\nstructures in Fig. 1 are ordered according to the increasing number of rows of atoms in\nthe 2D NWs and for a particular number of rows, the structures are shown with increasing\nstability. In Fig. 1, for a given 2D row of atoms, we have nearly exhausted all structural\npossibilities. For example, in Fig. 1(d), with four rows of atoms, four structural possibilities\nare applicable. Thus, hexagonal (HX), DZZ, triple rectangle (RT-3) and triple parallelogram\n(PR-3) structures are investigated. In most of the wires, the optimized structures have been\nfound to have primarily, zigzag, rectangular and parallelogram motifs or their combinations.\n\n1.\n\nSingle and Double row NWs\n\nThe single row linear NW shown in Fig. 1(a) is well studied. The possible simplest 2D\nNW with 2 rows of atoms are shown in Fig. 1(b) viz., zigzag (ZZ), rectangular (RT-1) and\nparallelogram (PR-1) (referred as 'zigzag under compression' by Portal et al.3,4 ). We have\ninvestigated these wires for verification and completeness of our calculations. Most of the\n5\n\n\fliterature on linear NW is for the wires suspended between the tips. Linear NW has been\nfound to be highly stable under stretching forces and has a quantum conductance of 1Go at\nroom temperature.1,2,27,28,32 Our optimized linear wire with an uniform Au-Au bond length\nof 2.61 \u00c5, is in good agreement with the bond length of 2.60 \u00c5 reported by Zarechnaya et\nal.33 Unlike finite gold NWs,34,35 the infinite linear NWs do not show variation in the bond\nlength or dimerization, in agreement with, the calculations by Xiao et al.34 and Nakamura\net al.27\nOur optimized ZZ structure has a bond length of 2.55 \u00c5 and bond angle of 131.5\u25e6 .\nThis agrees very well with the bond angle of 131\u25e6 calculated by D. Portal et al.3 Our\ncalculated distance between Au1 and Au3 atoms is 4.66 \u00c5, which, compares quite well\nwith 4.62 \u00c5 obtained by D. Portal et al.3 that demonstrate the binding energy plot has two\nminima as a function of bond angle for the ZZ structure. Our calculations are in confirmation\nwith earlier observations that the ZZ structure is a metastable structure when compared with\nPR-1 structure. These results were arrived from the binding energy plot as a function of\nbond angle.3,4 The ZZ structure is at the higher minimum (-1.90 eV) and the PR-1 structure\nis at the lower minimum (-2.22 eV) of the binding energy plot. The RT-1 structure has a\nlength of 2.65 \u00c5, width of 2.68 \u00c5 and the bond angles of 90\u25e6 . The relativistic calculations\nby Nakamura et al.27 have obtained 2.59 \u00c5 as the length and width of the rectangular\nwire.27 The PR-1 structure, is a more compact structure than the zigzag structure with all\nacute angles between the gold atoms. The length and width of parallelogram is 2.67 \u00c5 and\n2.76 \u00c5 respectively. An average bond length of 2.76 \u00c5 for parallelogram shaped NW\nhas been reported earlier by Tavazza et al. under elastic deformation in between the tips.7\nThe bond angle analysis shows that the parallelogram is formed of two isosceles triangles\nin disagreement with the structure reported by Fioravante et al.,31 which is made up of\nequilateral triangles. The preference for isosceles triangles over equilateral triangles is on\naccount of symmetry breaking along the non-periodic y direction. The PR-1 structure is\nfound to be the most stable double row NW, in agreement, with the earlier calculations by\nPortal et al.3,4 and Nakamura et al.27\n\n6\n\n\f2.\n\nTriple row NWs\n\nWe have examined three, triple row NW structures, double rectangular (RT-2), pentagonal (PNT), and double parallelogram (PR-2) as shown in Fig. 1(c). We have also performed\noptimization of another three row geometry, i.e., the rhombus structure (not shown in the\nfigure). We find that further lattice optimization of the infinite length rhombus structure\nleads to the energetically lower PR-2 structure. Unlike the ZZ structure, which has a distinct\nminima in the binding energy versus lattice separation diagram, the rhombus structure does\nnot reside in a distinct potential well. The optimization path smoothly curves down to the\nPR-2 structure. Recently, a single rhombus structure held between parallelogram NWs on\nboth sides was observed as an intermediate structure during compression of linear NW.7\nHowever, we would like to note that, so far, there have been no experimental reports of two\ndimensional rhombus shaped NW.29\nThe RT-2 structure, is made up of uniform rectangles stacked one on top of another,\nwith a length of 2.70 \u00c5, and width of 2.62 \u00c5. The initial geometry set up for the PNT NW\nwas made up of regular pentagons. Geometry optimization of this regular structure lead\nto a structure that has an admix of a RT-1 NW and a PR-1 NW as shown in Fig. 1c (ii).\nThe horizontal bond length is enhanced by 0.05 \u00c5 and 0.03 \u00c5 in comparison with their\nequivalent bond lengths in RT-1 and PR-1 structures respectively. The diagonal bond length\nin PNT is reduced by 0.02 \u00c5 in comparison with PR-1 structure. The bond angles between\nAu2 -Au5 -Au4 and Au2 -Au4 -Au5 are 60.5\u25e6 and 59.0\u25e6 respectively. The corresponding angles\nin the PR-1 structure are 61.2\u25e6 and 57.6\u25e6 , respectively.\nThe PR-2 structure is the most stable three row geometry. In the PR-2 NW, Au1 -Au2\nhave a bond length of 2.74 \u00c5 and Au2 -Au5 have a bond length 2.80 \u00c5. The bond angles\nbetween Au1 -Au2 -Au6 and Au2 -Au6 -Au1 are 61.4\u25e6 and 60.3\u25e6 respectively. Our analysis of\nbond angles shows that PR-2 structure is comprised of slightly distorted equivalent triangles.\n\n3.\n\nQuadruple row NWs\n\nFig. 1(d) shows the four row NW structures considered, namely, hexagonal (HX), double\nzigzag (DZZ), triple rectangular (RT-3), and triple parallelogram (PR-3). The optimized\nHX structure has bond lengths between Au1 -Au2 , Au2 -Au3 and Au2 -Au15 as 2.58 \u00c5, 2.58 \u00c5,\n\n7\n\n\fand 2.69 \u00c5 respectively. The structure is a slightly distorted hexagon with bond angles of\n115.1 and 129.8\u25e6 . The DZZ structure is made up of two zigzag NWs, with one placed on top\nof another one. The bond lengths between the atoms forming the zigzag shape, Au1 -Au4 ,\nAu2 -Au3 , Au4 -Au5 , Au3 -Au6 are 2.67 \u00c5. The bond lengths between the atoms Au2 -Au4 ,\nAu4 -Au6 are 2.65 \u00c5. Bond angle between Au1 -Au4 -Au2 is 65.4\u25e6 , whereas, the bond angle\nbetween the atoms Au1 -Au4 -Au5 is 113.9\u25e6 . In the DZZ structure, the bond lengths have\nstretched by 0.12 \u00c5 in comparison with the ZZ structure and the bond angles have reduced.\nThe RT-3 wire is interesting, as, it is the first NW geometry that exhibits dimerization in\nthe y direction. Although dimerization in finite linear wires is well observed and reported,34\ndimerization in thicker wires has not been reported so far. The length of the rectangles in\nRT-3 NW is 2.68 \u00c5 . The widths of the top, middle and bottom rectangles are 2.65 \u00c5, 2.61\n\u00c5 and 2.65 \u00c5, respectively. The dimerization has been explained on the basis of non-uniform\npotential experienced by the atoms in the finite length direction. No dimerization is observed\nin the infinite length direction in gold NWs on account of every atom experiencing a uniform\npotential.27,34 The PR-3 structure is formed of parallelograms that have a uniform length of\n2.72 \u00c5. The widths of the two terminal parallelograms are 2.75 \u00c5, which have expanded by\n0.01 \u00c5 in comparison with the PR-2 NW. The width of the central parallelograms is 2.74\n\u00c5, same, as that of the PR-2 NW.\n\n4.\n\nQuintuple row NWs\n\nWe have investigated three, five row NW structures, centered hexagonal (CHX), quadruple rectangular (RT-4) and quadruple parallelogram (PR-4) as shown in Fig.1(e). The CHX\nwire is generated from the HX wire (shown in Fig. 1d (i)) by placing a gold atom at the\ncenter of each hexagon. The additional atom in the center, expands the length of each side\nof hexagon by 0.12 \u00c5. The bond angles are observed to expand in one case from 115.1 to\n118.3\u25e6 , while the other contracts from 129.8 to 123.4\u25e6 in comparison with that of the HX\nNWs.\nThe RT-4 structure shows dimerization in the non-periodic direction like the RT-3 NW.\nThe terminal rectangles have a width of 2.66 \u00c5 and the two central rectangles have a\nwidth of 2.63 \u00c5. The terminal and central rectangles have a uniform length of 2.66 \u00c5. The\nPR-4 structure is made up of slightly distorted equilateral triangles. The length of the\n8\n\n\fparallelograms is 2.73 \u00c5. The width of the terminal parallelograms is 2.76 \u00c5 whereas, that\nof the two central parallelograms is 2.74 \u00c5. Similar to the RT-4 NW, dimerization in the\nlength along the non-periodic direction is observed.\nIn general, as the number of rows in the NW increases, the bond lengths between the\ngold atoms along the length of the NW are seen to increase, whereas, the bond lengths\nperpendicular to the length decrease. Linear NW has the smallest bond length (2.61 \u00c5) and\nthe PR-4 has the largest bond lengths (2.73 \u00c5). This bond length is smaller by 0.22 \u00c5 in\ncomparison with the bulk bond length of 2.95 \u00c5. The bond angles show an opposite trend.\nThe bond angles are decreasing with an increasing number of rows in the NWs. In the PR\nshaped NW's, the bond angles are converging with increasing number of rows to their bulk\nvalue of 60\u25e6 . Within a particular number of rows, the bond lengths of the less stable NW\nstructures are smaller than the bond lengths of the most stable NWs.\nSimilar to finite gold NWs,34 dimerization along the finite second dimension of the wire,\nis observed in RT-3, PR-3, RT-4 and PR-4 NWs. We would like to note that the structure\nof RT-3 and RT-4 wires is similar to zero thickness nanoribbon of (100) surface and that of\nPR-3 and PR-4 wires is similar to a zero thickness nanoribbon of (111) surface.\n\nB.\n\nStability\n\nThe stability of linear wires has been investigated earlier by Nakamura et al.27 and Portal\net al.3 Their calculations have shown that the PR-1 shaped wire is more stable over the ZZ\nand RT-1 wires. These three NWs are made up of a double row of atoms and have a higher\nstability in comparison with the LR wire. The stability of the ZZ wire over the LR wire is\nargued to be on account of the d levels in the ZZ NWs being situated well below the Fermi\nlevel, in comparison with, that of the LR wire. This raises a few interesting questions related\nwith zero thickness NWs. Will the stability of the NWs increase as one increases the width\ni.e. the number of rows in the 2D NWs? Is stability related to the location of the d levels\nwith respect to the Fermi level?\nIn order to investigate this, we have listed the NWs in ascending order of stability in Table\nI. The number of atomic rows in the non-periodic direction are also listed. In agreement\nwith the earlier calculations,3 we observe that the LR wire is less stable. The ZZ NW is\nstable over linear NW by 0.2 eV and the PR-1 wire is stable over ZZ and RT-1 wire by 0.32\n9\n\n\feV and 0.13 eV, respectively.\nIn the three row NW structures, the PR-2 wire is more stable over the RT-2 and PNT\nwires by 0.15 eV and 0.07 eV, respectively. In the four row structures, the DZZ is stable\nby 0.31 eV in comparison with the HX NWs. This DZZ NW has been considered to be a\n\"magic structure\" adopted by NWs during the thinning process.31 Interestingly, this four\nrow structure is less stable not only in comparison with the three row PNT and PR-2 NWs\nbut also in comparison with all other four row (except hexagonal) and five row NWs. In the\nfive row structures, the CHX wire is less stable by 0.22 eV in comparison with the PR-4. It\nis most interesting to note that the RT-4 NW is stable over the CHX wire by 0.01 eV.\nIt is clearly evident from the results in Table I, that the stability of the NWs does not\nincrease linearly with an increase in the number of rows in the structures. Figure 2 shows\ngold NWs sorted on the basis of the stability with the increasing number of rows. It can be\nseen that the HX wire, with 4 rows, is less stable than the double row NWs. (We have noted\nearlier that the ZZ is not stable structure, rather the PR-1 structure is stable) The PR-2\nNW, with 3 rows, is highly stable in comparison with most of the 4 row and 5 row NWs.\nWhat is more interesting is that the double, triple and quadruple parallelogram NWs are\nthe most stable not only within a particular number of rows but even across them. The next\nstable NWs are the rectangular shaped NWs. However, as one increases the number of rows,\nthe energy difference between the rectangular and parallelogram NWs is seen to gradually\nincrease as 0.13 eV (double row), 0.15 eV (triple row), 0.18 eV (quadruple row) and 0.21 eV\n(quintuple row). Hence, we conclude that the parallelogram motif is the most stable motif\nfor 2D gold NWs. We performed additional calculations by increasing the number of rows to\n18 for only the parallelogram and rectangular shaped NWs. In addition, we have obtained\nthe binding energies of a single layer surface of gold having (111) and (100) orientations as\n-2.86 eV/atom and -2.58 eV/atom respectively. Our results in inset of Fig. 2 show that\nthe binding energies of higher row parallelogram and rectangular NWs are converging to\ntheir zero thickness film limit. These results indicate that (111) single layer films will have\na higher stability over (100) films.\nTo further investigate the stability of the gold NW structures, we have performed a\nnearest neighbor analysis of the structures based on the charge density distribution (charge\ndensity plots not included here). The spatial distribution of electronic charge is observed\nto be symmetric along the bonding direction of atoms in the NWs. The charge density\n10\n\n\fdistribution of the NWs shows that as one goes from linear to PR-4 structure, there is an\nincreased sharing of electrons between the atoms. The homogeneous distribution of electron\ndensity in all the NWs investigated here, is indicative of metallic bonding in the NWs.\nThe number of nearest neighbors of the different atoms in the NWs are listed in Table\nII along with the number of bonds per atom. In the nearest neighbor column of Table\nII, more than one entry is listed to account for different atoms having different number of\nnearest neighbors, depending on whether they belong to the edge rows or one of the central\nrows. Within a particular number of rows of atoms, the NW with the largest number of\nbonds per atom is found to be the most stable. In the double row NWs, PR-1 with 2 bonds\nper atom is most stable. In the triple row structures, PR-2 with 2.33 bonds/atom is most\nstable. In quadruple row structures, PR-3 with 2.5 bonds per atom is most stable and in\nquintuple row structures the PR-4 with 2.80 bonds/atom is the most stable. An increased\nnumber of bonds between the atoms tends to increase the stability of the NWs. However,\nthis bonding picture does not explain the higher stability of RT-2, PNT and DZZ with less\nnumber of bonds per atom than the parallelogram NW. Thus, it is important to consider\nother electronic effects when understanding the stability of the NWs.\nFigure 3 shows the electronic band structure (BS) in the left panel and the density of\nstates (DOS) in the right panel for three NW structures viz., LR, RT-4 and PR-4 representing the least stable and most stable among rectangular and parallelogram structures\nrespectively. The horizontal dotted line represents the Fermi level. In all the 14 NWs, the\nmajor contributions to the density of states are from the d electrons. Hence, only the d\ncontributions to the density of states and the total density of states are shown in the figure.\nOur analysis of DOS shows that all wires are metallic except for the DZZ which has a gap\nof 1.04 eV at the Fermi level. This is the only wire that exhibits semiconducting characteristics, in agreement with the calculations by Fioravante et al.31 The DOS shows that within\na particular number of rows, the most stable NW has a higher delocalization of d electrons.\nIn the investigations on the stability of LR and ZZ wires, it has been argued that in the\nLR wire the d states are spread till the Fermi level destabilizing these wires in comparison\nwith the ZZ wires.3 Nakamura et al.27 and Portal et al.3 have accounted the stability of the\nZZ wire to the separation between s and d bands near the Fermi level and the pulling of the\nd bands below the Fermi level. The calculated DOS of 3, 4 and 5 row NWs show that the\ns and d states are spread until the Fermi level and yet the wires have an enhanced stability\n11\n\n\fover the zigzag wire. We have also calculated and listed in Table I, the location of the peak\nof d bands from the Fermi level, and the width of the d bands below the Fermi level. The\nmost stable RT-4, PR-2, PR-3 and PR-4 NWs have their d band peaks closer to the Fermi\nlevel in comparison with the less stable RT-2, PNT and CHX NWs. These results clearly\nshow that the location of the d band peak is not an indicator of the stability of the wires.\nThe width of d bands, however, is related with the stability of the wires. In general, the\nwidth of the d bands is seen to increase with increased stability. An increase in the width\nof d bands translates to an increased delocalization of the d electrons. Hence, geometries\nexhibiting an increased delocalization of the d orbital electrons are the most stable NW\nstructures. As seen from Table I, the width of the d bands in the PR-1 wire is less than\nthat of the RT-2, PNT and DZZ wire. This explains the stability of the RT-2, PNT and\nDZZ wires over the parallelogram NW. Further, in the case of rectangular NWs, the RT-2\nwith a larger width of d bands is less stable in comparison with RT-3 and RT-4 NWs, which\nhave a smaller width of d bands. Our detailed investigations on the orbital contributions\nin the DOS of the NWs revealed that besides the d bands, the s, px and py bands play a\nrole in the stability of the wires. With an increase in the number of rows in the NWs, the s\nand px orbitals exhibit increased localization and enhancement in the peak heights. The py\nelectrons, on the other hand, show increased delocalization with an increase in the number\nof rows. This increased delocalization of the py electrons leads to higher stability in triple\nand quadruple rectangular NWs, in spite of having somewhat smaller width of d bands.\nAlthough the p contributions to the density of states are one-tenth of that of the d states,\nthey play an important role in the stability of 2D NWs.\nAn analysis of all the parallelogram shaped NWs and their comparison with rectangular\nshaped NWs reveals that all electrons show increased delocalization in the parallelogram\nNWs (not shown in the figure). The peaks of the DOS of d electrons are at the same energies\nin the parallelogram and rectangular NWs. The px and py electrons are more delocalized in\nthe parallelogram shaped NWs as compared to that of rectangular NWs. The s electrons\nshow enhanced delocalization and enhanced peaks in comparison with rectangular NWs.\nThe contributions from s electrons are significant (one-third of that of the d electrons). The\npeaks of the s, px and py levels in the DOS are slightly more shifted below the Fermi level in\ncomparison with the peaks of these states in the rectangular NWs. The delocalization of s,\npx and py electrons in addition to the delocalization of d electrons accounts for the increased\n12\n\n\fstability of these wires in comparison with that of rectangular shaped NWs.\n\nC.\n\nConductivity\n\nAll experimental and theoretical research on conductance in gold NWs reports conductance in quanta of Go . The electronic contribution to the conductance behavior has not\nbeen investigated in detail except for the linear nanowire.8,9,13,36 In this section, we present\ncorrelation between electronic structure and conductance behavior of 2D gold NWs based on\n'fat bands' analysis. Such analysis, in general will be useful for other kinds of nanowires as\nwell. The conductance in 2D nanowires is calculated based on the Landuaer-B\u00fcttiker (LB)\nformalism25 as implemented by Oetzel et al. for infinite chains.26 This formalism has been\ndeveloped for infinite one dimensional chains, where the effects of leads are negligible as their\nresistance is negligible in comparison with the wire resistance. Our results indicate that,\nthe formalism works for somewhat wider chains as well. We have obtained the transmission\ncoefficients using LB formalism for the 14 gold NW structures.\nFor linear NW, the transmission at the Fermi level shows a jump from 3Go to 1Go as\nshown in Fig. 5(a), in agreement with, the earlier reports on conductance calculations.26,27,37\nIt has been shown by Dreher et al.,8 that the stretched linear NW of two atoms suspended\nbetween tips has single conductance channel mainly from 6s electrons. At the end of the\nstretching, the linear NW is of 4 atoms and shows 2 or 3 channels for conductance, which are\ndue to participation of d electrons. Our fat bands analysis on unconstrained NWs plotted\nin Fig. 4(a) shows that the single conduction channel in linear NW is made of s orbital\nelectrons hybridized with px , dxy , dxz orbitals. The s, dxy and dxz orbitals have significant\ncontributions in conduction with px playing a minor role.\nMost experimental and theoretical work on gold NWs8,26,27,29,37 demonstrates that the\ndecrease in the conductance closely follows the decrease in the cross section of NWs during\ntheir thinning process. As the cross section of the NW decreases, the conductance decreases\nto 1Go . (The cross section is determined as the number of atomic rows multiplied by the area\nper atomic row.29 ) In analogy with this, in 2D structures, thickness of the NW will be related\nwith the number of rows of atoms in one of the non periodic directions. Our conductance\ncalculations listed in Table-II demonstrate that the number of conduction channels are not\ndirectly related with the number of rows of atoms. Structure of the NW plays a prominent\n13\n\n\frole in the conduction behavior. HX, DZZ and PR-1 with more than one row of atoms\nhave zero conductance at Fermi level. CHX and ZZ structures, which are somewhat more\nstable than linear NW have same conductance as linear NW at the Fermi level. The most\nstable rectangular and parallelogram NWs viz., RT-4 and PR-4 does not show any block\nin the transmission for the complete energy range. Another interesting feature observed is\nthat in rectangular NWs, the conductance is related with the number of rows whereas, in\nparallelogram NWs, the conductance is less than the number of rows of atoms, in agreement\nwith Kurui et al.29 We give an explanation for this based on density of states analysis\nsubsequently.\nTo understand the origin of conductance in different structures, we have performed fat\nband analysis of the 14 NWs. In Fig.4, we have shown only 3 representative structures viz.,\nthe most investigated LR, second most stable RT-4 and highest stable PR-4. In general, we\nobserve that in all gold NWs, the conductance channels are formed by hybridization of s,\ndxy , dx2 \u2212y2 , px and py orbitals. The s, dxy and dx2 \u2212y2 orbitals have major contribution in the\nconductance with minor px and py orbital characters. All parallelogram shaped NWs have\nstrong s and dxy character except for PR-1 structure, whereas, in rectangular shaped NWs,\nthe s and dx2 \u2212y2 orbital gives major contribution at Fermi energy. As the number of rows in\nparallelogram NWs increases in non periodic direction, the dx2 \u2212y2 orbital character is slightly\nenhanced. Similar to parallelogram NWs, dxy orbital character in rectangular shaped NWs,\nis slightly enhanced as the number of rows of atoms are increased. The contribution from s\nin the conduction channel are reduced from RT-2 to RT-4 and are the same as RT-2 for all\nother higher row rectangular NWs. All rectangular NWs show almost same contribution of\ndx2 \u2212y2 orbital character at Fermi energy with the increasing number of rows in the structure.\nIn order to investigate the dependence of conduction on number of rows in rectangular\nand parallelogram NWs, we performed detailed analysis of DOS for these NWs. It has\nbeen observed that in the rectangular NWs the s, px , py and dx2 \u2212y2 electrons have more\ncontributions at the Fermi level. In the parallelogram shaped NWs, the peaks of the s, px\nand py orbitals are more shifted below the Fermi level in comparison with the rectangular\nshaped NWs. In both the rectangular and parallelogram shaped NWs, the positions of\nthe peaks of the rest of the d states are identical. In the rectangular shaped NWs, the\ncontributions from dx2 \u2212y2 electrons at the Fermi level are greater than that of parallelogram\nNWs and contributions from dxy electrons are lesser than that of parallelogram NWs. The\n14\n\n\fcontributions from rest of the d states are zero at the Fermi level in both types of NWs.\nThus in the parallelogram shaped NWs, the more bound s, px and py electrons become less\navailable for conduction, but at the same time, they lead to an increase in the stability\nof the NWs. The enhanced contributions from s, px , py and dx2 \u2212y2 electrons leads to an\nincreased conductivity in rectangular shaped NWs. From the transmission histograms and\nthe band structure of the rectangular and parallelogram shaped wires, it can be inferred that\nthe jumps in conductivity are related with the number of the confined s, p and d electrons\ncontributing in the transmission at that particular temperature.\n\nIV.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nWe have performed detailed investigations on 2D ribbon like gold NWs of 1-5 rows of\natoms. Amongst structures with same number of rows, the wires with a parallelogram motif\nare the most stable. Our study reveals that as the number of rows increase, the bond lengths\nincrease and the bond angles decrease towards their bulk values. Gold NWs > 3 rows of\natoms, exhibit dimerization in the non periodic direction similar to that observed in finite\nNWs.\nFurthermore our study of the stability analysis of the fourteen structures reveals that\nthe linear wire is the least stable and the quadruple parallelogram NW is the most stable.\nContrary to conventional logic, the stability of the NWs does not increase merely with an\nincrease in the number of rows in the NWs but the structure plays an important role. Our\ncalculations demonstrate that the four row hexagonal NW has lower stability than double\nrow pentagonal NW. Some other four and five row NWs also have a lower stability than\nthe triple row PR-2 NW. These results demonstrate that, besides the increased coordination\nwith increasing number of rows of atoms, the geometrical structure plays an important role\nin determining the stability of NWs. Structural shapes that increase the delocalization of s,\np and d electrons show an enhanced stability.\nWe find that the stability of rectangular motif is second to that parallelogram motif and\nthe difference in their energies increases with increasing number of atomic rows in the nonperiodic direction. The quadruple rectangular and quadruple parallelogram are similar to\nzero thickness nanoribbons of (100) and (111) surfaces, respectively. Our results for NWs\nwith extended rows of atoms until the zero thickness limit show that (111) oriented single\n15\n\n\flayer films have higher stability than (100) single layer films.\nOur electronic structure investigations into the stability of 2D nanowires imply that if\nexperimental thinning process were to be carried out on thicker gold NWs then it would\nresult in observation of sequence of PR-4 structure followed by PR-3 structure to PR-2\nstructure and then to LR structure. Unstable single atom linear chains would be observed\nin the end just before breaking. In fact, our conclusions have been partly verified in available\nliterature. Recent work by Kurui et al.29 observed stepwise triple, double and single strands\nof (111) and (100) atomic sheets during the thinning process. The theoretical investigations\nby Tavazza et al.7 found four stable intermediate atomic configurations during the elongation\nprocess, namely, parallelogram (mentioned as 'zigzag'), centered hexagonal (mentioned as\n'hexagonal'), triangular (110) and triangular (111).\nThe Landuaer-B\u00fcttiker transmission coefficients of the NWs show that all wires are conducting at 0K except for the hexagonal, double parallelogram and double zigzag. Our\ncalculations on the 1-5 row structures show that stability and conductance are inversely\nrelated. The less stable NWs show higher available conductance channels in comparison\nwith the more stable NWs. The conductance in rectangular wires is equal to, whereas, in\nparallelogram shaped wires it is less than the number of rows of atoms in the wires. The\nband fattened electronic structure of all NWs shows that the conducting channels are not\npurely s, but have contributions from px , py , dxy and dx2 \u2212y2 electrons. The jumps in the\nconduction channels are correlated with the electronic band structure of the NWs. All the\nwires whether conducting or non-conducting exhibit spd hybridization. We conclude from\nthe calculations of quantum conductance that supported but otherwise unstable gold NW\nribbons could be more conducting than their structurally stable counterparts.\nThis study serves as the basis for investigating from first principles the stability and\nconductivity of different alloyed NWs. The effects of the different alloying elements and\ntheir concentration in Au NWs is under investigation. Such 2D NWs will be very attractive\ncandidates for (bio)-sensing and (bio)-electronic applications and may also be suitable for\nnon-invasive transdermal drug release applications.\n\n16\n\n\fV.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nThis work was performed using BARC mainframe supercomputers (ajeya and ameya).\nDilip G Kanhere and Stefan Bl\u00fcgel are gratefully acknowledged for stimulating discussions.\nV.

Within any row, the geometries are arranged in ascending order of\nstability with (i) depicting the least stable and (iii)/(iv) depicting the most stable structures.\n\nFIG. 2: Gold nanowire structures shown on binding energy plot as a function of number\nof rows. Figure in the inset shows extended binding energy curve for parallelogram and\nrectangular nanowires to 18 rows of atoms. Red filled squares show binding energy per\natom for parallelogram motifs, whereas empty blue squares show binding energy per atom\nfor rectangular motifs.\n\nFIG. 3: The electronic band structure and density of states (DOS) for (i)LR, (ii)RT-4\nand (iii)PR-3 NWs. In each plot, the left panel shows electronic band structure and right\npanel shows the corresponding DOS with the Fermi level set to zero. The dotted line\nrepresents the Fermi level. The blue line represents the DOS of the d electrons and the red\nline represents the total DOS.\n\nFIG. 4: The electronic band structure close to Fermi level for gold nanowires using\nthe fat band technique. In all figures, Fermi level is set to zero and shown by the dotted\nline.\n\nThe red colored bands are the fattened bands of the band structure that show\n\nthe contribution from that particular orbital electrons.\n\n(a)Linear (LR), (b)Quadruple\n\nrectangular (RT-4) and (c) Quadruple parallelogram (PR-4).\n\nFIG. 4: Transmission histograms of (a) linear (LR), (b) Quadruple rectangular (RT-4)\nand (c) Quadruple Parallelogram (PR-4)\n\nTable I: The location of d band peak with respect to Fermi level and the width of the d\nbands of the gold nanowires, arranged according to increasing order of stability.\n\nTable II: The binding energy (eV/atom), number of nearest neighbors, the number of\nbonds formed per atom in the gold nanowires and number of conduction channels of gold\n19\n\n\fnanowires shown in Fig. 1. The number of rows of atoms in the nanowire structures are\nalso listed for comparison.\n\n20\n\n\fGeometry\n\nNumber\n\nd peak\n\nwidth of\n\nof rows\n\nwith respect\n\nd bands\n\nto Ef\nLinear (LR)\n\n1\n\n\u22121.12\n\n5.58\n\nZigzag (ZZ)\n\n2\n\n\u22121.11\n\n5.54\n\nHexagonal (HX)\n\n4\n\n\u22121.38\n\n5.82\n\nRectangular (RT-1)\n\n2\n\n\u22121.57\n\n6.58\n\nParallelogram (PR-1)\n\n2\n\n\u22121.72\n\n6.80\n\nDouble Rectangular (RT-2)\n\n3\n\n\u22122.37\n\n7.23\n\nDouble Zigzag (DZZ)\n\n4\n\n\u22121.76\n\n7.16\n\nPentagonal (PNT)\n\n3\n\n\u22121.99\n\n7.41\n\nTriple Rectangular (RT-3)\n\n4\n\n\u22121.94\n\n7.02\n\nCentered Hexagonal (CHX)\n\n5\n\n\u22122.11\n\n7.57\n\nQuadruple Rectangular (RT-4)\n\n5\n\n\u22121.88\n\n7.13\n\nDouble Parallelogram (PR-2)\n\n3\n\n\u22121.87\n\n7.68\n\nTriple Parallelogram (PR-3)\n\n4\n\n\u22121.95\n\n7.99\n\nQuadruple Parallelogram (PR-4)\n\n5\n\n\u22121.92\n\n8.12\n\nTable-I\n\nV.
