Freed\nDepartment of Mathematics\nUniversity of Texas at Austin\nMay 31, 2007\nIn memory of Raoul Bott\nAbstract. The Wess-Zumino-Witten term was first introduced in the low energy \u03c3-model which describes pions, the Goldstone bosons for the broken flavor symmetry in quantum chromodynamics. We\nintroduce a new definition of this term in arbitrary gravitational backgrounds. It matches several features of the fundamental gauge theory, including the presence of fermionic states and the anomaly of\nthe flavor symmetry. To achieve this matching we use a certain generalized differential cohomology theory. We also prove a formula for the determinant line bundle of special families of Dirac operators on\n4-manifolds in terms of this cohomology theory. One consequence is that there are no global anomalies\nin the Standard Model (in arbitrary gravitational backgrounds).\n\nQuantum chromodynamics has a global symmetry group G \u00d7 G, where G = SUNf in the theory\nwith Nf flavors of massless quarks. This is presumed broken to the diagonal, with the homogeneous\nspace (G \u00d7 G)/G parameterizing the vacua. The low energy dynamics of the Goldstone bosons-\nthe pions-is modeled by a nonlinear \u03c3-model with target (G \u00d7 G)/G; see [We] for an account.\nThere is a topological term in the \u03c3-model action, first introduced by Wess and Zumino [WZ]\nand later elaborated by Witten [W1]; see also [N]. We propose a new, geometric definition of\nthis term (Definition 4.1). Our motivation is to reproduce certain features of the high energy\ngauge theory in the low energy effective theory. By working in the Euclidean theory formulated\non arbitrary Riemannian spin 4-manifolds-in other words, by studying the theory in an arbitrary\nEuclidean gravitational background-we are able to probe more than can be seen in flat spacetime.1\nSpecifically:\n(i) a spin structure is required to define this new WZW term, just as a spin structure is\nnecessary in the high energy theory to define spinor fields;\nThe work of D.S.F. is supported in part by NSF grant DMS-0603964. I also thank the Aspen Center for Physics\nfor warm hospitality during the final stages of this work.\n1 Indeed, previous treatments use spherical compactifications of spacetime, and because the Hurewicz map \u03c0 G \u2192\n5\nH5 G is not an isomorphism certain features were missed.\n\n1\n\n\f(ii) canonical quantization naturally gives a Z/2Z-graded Hilbert space, matching the presence\nof both bosonic and fermionic states in QCD, and the statistics formula (4.10) which follows\ndirectly from our definition is correct;\n(iii) our definition works for Nf = 2; and\n(iv) there is a natural gauged version of the theory whose anomaly matches that of gauged QCD.\nThis last property is an example of 't Hooft anomaly matching ['tH], and it serves to fix the\ncoefficient of the WZW term, as in [W1]. We emphasize the second point, that fermionic states\nappear in a theory with only bosonic fields. This phenomenon also occurs in theories with self-dual\nfields [FMS1], but via a different mechanism. We verify properties (i)\u2013(iv) in \u00a74.\nTo capture all of these features we use a generalized cohomology theory where previously ordinary\nintegral cohomology was used. Generalized cohomology theories, especially the various forms of Ktheory, appear in high energy theoretical physics in connection with anomalies-through the AtiyahSinger index theorem-and as a home for the Dirac quantization of Ramond-Ramond charges in\nsuperstring theory. The theory we encounter here also appears when defining three-dimensional\nChern-Simons theory on spin manifolds [J]. It has also appeared recently [FHT], [AS] in connection\nwith twisted K-theory, though that connection plays no role here. This special cohomology theory,\nwhich we simply denote 'E' and elucidate in \u00a71, has exactly two nontrivial homotopy groups,\nso is a simple twisted product of two ordinary cohomology theories.2 It is a natural home for a\ncharacteristic class of complex vector bundles which plays the role of c3 /2, half the third Chern class\n(see Proposition 1.9). This allows us to prove in \u00a72 that the isomorphism class of the determinant\nline bundle of special families of Dirac operators on spin 4-manifolds is computed as an integral\nin E. There are analogous specialized index theorems in dimensions one [FW,(5.22)] and two [F,\u00a75]\nin terms of ordinary cohomology. As the dimension grows, the denominators in the Riemann-Roch\nformula grow, and so the index recedes further from ordinary cohomology. The small denominator\nof 2 in our problem permits the formula in terms of the cohomology theory E.\nIt is critical in our applications that these topological ideas be promoted to theorems in generalized differential cohomology [HS]. Thus Theorem 2.2 is a formula in differential E-cohomology for\nthe determinant line bundle with its covariant derivative. Ordinary differential cohomology, also\nknown as smooth Deligne cohomology or the theory of Cheeger-Simons differential characters, was\nfirst used by Gaw\u0229dzki [G] to express terms of Wess-Zumino-Witten type. In \u00a74 we use differential\nE-theory to define the Wess-Zumino-Witten term in the effective \u03c3-model for pions. The main\npoint is that there is a class \u03bd \u2208 E 5 (G) which is in a precise sense half the generator of H 5 (G),\nas we prove in Proposition 1.9. The gauged WZW term, as defined in Definition 4.14, depends on\na certain transgression which occurs when attempting to extend \u03bd to a (G \u00d7 G)-equivariant class.\n(The connection between the gauged WZW term and transgression was made in ordinary cohomol2 Although\n\nmost familiar are geometric cohomology theories, such as K-theories and cobordism theories, generalized cohomology theories are like boutiques: abundant and specialized. The theory E is a minimal choice for this\nproblem, but presumably not a unique one.\n\n2\n\n\fogy in [W4,Appendix].) The class \u03bd does not so extend: the obstruction is the anomaly, which is\nthe transgression of \u03bd, and the transgressing 'E-cochain' is used to define the gauged WZW term.\nThis whole discussion must be carried out in the differential theory,3 so requires the construction\nof a transgressing differential form (5.16).4\nThe index formula proved in Theorem 2.2 applies to compute anomalies in four-dimensional\ngauge theories. Here we mean the full anomaly, including global anomalies. Indeed, in Example 3.4\nwe prove that the Standard Model has no global anomalies. We apply the index formula to compute\nthe anomaly in gauged QCD (Proposition 3.7). Also, the characteristic class \u03bc leads to the definition\n(Definition 3.10) of an anomaly-free subgroup which captures both local and global anomalies.\nThere are other models of QCD with different flavor symmetry groups and so different homogeneous spaces in the low energy effective \u03c3-model; see [MMN], [DZ] for example. Presumably there\nis a similar story for the WZW term in these cases as well, but we leave it for others to investigate.\nRaoul had a tremendous influence on me, both mathematically and personally. His passion for\nmathematics and music was infectious, his passion for life inspiring. He was a great teacher in every\nsense of the word. I'd like to think that this mix of geometry, topology, and physics-with a touch\nof transgression thrown in-would be to his taste.\nIt is a pleasure to thank Jacques Distler, Mike Hopkins, Greg Moore, Sonia Paban, and Lorenzo\nSadun for valuable discussions and comments.\n\n\u00a71 E-Theory\nIn topology a cohomology theory is specified by a spectrum, which is a sequence {En }n\u2208Z of\npointed topological spaces and maps \u03a3En \u2192 En+1 such that the adjoint maps En \u2192 \u03a9En+1 are\nhomeomorphisms.

Thus given a map\nf : X \u2192 Y whose stable relative normal bundle f \u2217 T Y \u2212 T X carries a spin structure, there is an\numker or pushforward map\nf\u2217 : E \u2022 (X) \u2212\u2192 E \u2022\u2212n (Y ),\n\n(1.6)\nwhere n = dim X \u2212 dim Y .\n\nThe differential theory \u011a associated to E is defined on smooth manifolds M ; see [HS,\u00a74] and\nalso [FMS2,\u00a72] for an expository introduction to some aspects of differential cohomology (in general,\nnot specifically for this theory E) which is geared to physicists. We will not repeat the definitions\nhere (except in Definition 5.10) but do note the following exact sequence [HS,(4.57)].

The differential form associated to a differential cohomology class is termed its curvature.\nThe differential E-groups in low degrees also have geometric interpretations: \u011a 1 (M ) is the topological abelian group of maps M \u2192 R/Z and \u011a 2 (M ) is the topological abelian group of isomorphism\nclasses of Z/2Z-graded hermitian line bundles with unitary covariant derivative. Integration in \u011a\nis defined over a fiber bundle X \u2192 Y whose stable normal (or tangent) bundle is given a spin\nstructure.\nAfter these generalities we turn to the construction of the characteristic class \u03bc. We use the\nstandard notions wn , pn , cn for Stiefel-Whitney, Pontrjagin, and Chern classes. We also use the\nnotation h3 , h5 for generators of H 3 (SUN ), H 5 (SUN ). Only the mod 2 reduction of the former\nenters; the sign of the latter, defined for N \u2265 3, is fixed in (1.15) below.\nProposition 1.9.\n(i) There is an isomorphism E 4 (BSO) \u223c\n= Z with generator \u03bb satisfying\nk(\u03bb) = p1 ,\n\nj(\u03bb) \u2261 w2\n5\n\n(mod 2).\n\n\fThe pullback of \u03bb to BSpin is i(\u03bb\u0303) for a class \u03bb\u0303 \u2208 H 4 (BSpin) with 2\u03bb\u0303 = p1 .\n(ii) For N \u2265 3 there is an isomorphism E 6 (BSUN ) \u223c\n= Z with generator \u03bc satisfying\nk(\u03bc) = c3 ,\n\nj(\u03bc) \u2261 c2\n\n(mod 2).\n\nAlso, E 6 (BSU2 ) \u223c\n= Z/2Z and the generator \u03bc satisfies j(\u03bc) \u2261 c2 (mod 2).\n(iii) For all N \u2265 1 there is an isomorphism E 6 (BSpN ) \u223c\n= Z/2Z. The generator is the pullback\nof \u03bc under BSpN \u2192 BSU2N .\n(iv) For N \u2265 3 there is an isomorphism E 5 (SUN ) \u223c\n= Z with generator \u03bd satisfying\n(1.10)\n\nk(\u03bd) = h5 ,\n\nj(\u03bd) \u2261 h3\n\n(mod 2).\n\nThe class \u03bd is invariant under left and right translation by SUN . Also, E 5 (SU2 ) \u223c\n= Z/2Z and the\ngenerator \u03bd satisfies j(\u03bd) \u2261 h3 (mod 2).\n(v) The characteristic class \u03bc obeys a Whitney sum formula: if V1 , V2 are complex vector bundles\nwith trivialized determinants, then\n(1.11)\n\n\u03bc(V1 \u2295 V2 ) = \u03bc(V1 ) + \u03bc(V2 ).\n\nAlso, \u03bc(V ) = \u2212\u03bc(V ).\nNote that c2 (mod 2) is the pullback of w4 under BSUN \u2192 BSO. The class \u03bb plays the role of\n' 21 p1 ' and the class \u03bc plays the role of ' 21 c3 '.\nProof. For (i) we construct a map BSO \u2192 E4 by attaching cells of dimension \u2265 6 to BSO to\nkill \u03c0q BSO, q \u2265 5; the space so constructed is E4 . This gives an element \u03bb \u2208 E 4 (BSO) for which\nj(\u03bb) = w2 and k(\u03bb) = p1 . Now use (1.3) and the map BSpin \u2192 BSO to obtain a commutative\ndiagram in which the rows are exact:\nH 1 (BSO; Z/2Z)\n\n0\n\n/ H 4 (BSO)\n\ni1\n\n/ E 4 (BSO)\n\n/ H 2 (BSO; Z/2Z)\n\n\u000f\n/ E 4 (BSpin)\n\n\u000f\n/ H 2 (BSpin; Z/2Z)\n\n\u03b2\u25e6Sq2\n\n/ H 5 (BSO)\n\na\n\n\u000f\nH 1 (BSpin; Z/2Z)\n\n0\n\n\u000f\n/ H 4 (BSpin)\n\ni2\n\n\u03b2\u25e6Sq2\n\n\u000f\n/ H 5 (BSpin)\n\nIn the top row H 4 (BSO) \u223c\n= Z with generator p1 ; H 2 (BSO; Z/2Z) \u223c\n= Z/2Z with generator w2 ;\n4\n2\n2\nand \u03b2w2 = 0 since w2 \u2261 p1 (mod 2). Thus E (BSO) \u223c\n= Z or Z \u00d7 Z/2Z, but the existence\nof \u03bb \u2208 E 4 (BSO) with k(\u03bb) = p1 rules out the latter, using (1.5). In the second row of the diagram\nH 2 (BSpin; Z/2Z) = 0, from which i2 is an isomorphism. Also, H 4 (BSpin) \u223c\n= Z and we can choose\na generator \u03bb\u0303 such that a(p1 ) = 2\u03bb\u0303.\n6\n\n\fFor (ii) we note that the space BSUN has a CW presentation BSUN \u223c S 4 \u222a e6 \u222a * * * , valid\nfor N \u2265 3. The attaching map \u2202e6 \u2192 S 4 is \u03b7, the double suspension of the Hopf map S 3 \u2192 S 2 ;\nit represents the nontrivial element of \u03c05 S 4 \u223c\n= Z/2Z. (That the attaching map is nontrivial follows\nfrom the relation Sq 2 c2 \u2261 c3 (mod 2), for example.) The long exact sequence in E-cohomology\nattached to the cofibration\nS 4 \u222a\u03b7 e6 \u2212\u2192 BSUN \u2212\u2192 (BSUN , S 4 \u222a\u03b7 e6 )\n\n(1.12)\n\nshows that E 6 (S 4 \u222a\u03b7 e6 ) \u223c\n= E 6 (BSUN ), since the CW presentation of the quotient starts with an\n8-cell. By the suspension isomorphism\ne 4 (CP2 ).\nE 6 (S 4 \u222a\u03b7 e6 ) \u223c\n= E 4 (S 2 \u222a\u03b7 e4 ) \u223c\n=E\n\n(1.13)\n\ne 4 is the reduced E-cohomology,\nIn (1.13) the attaching map \u03b7 : \u2202e4 \u2192 S 2 is the Hopf map, and E\nwhich in this case is isomorphic to the unreduced E-cohomology. Then the exact sequence\n0 \u2212\u2192 H 4 (CP2 ) \u2212\u2192 E 4 (CP2 ) \u2212\u2192 H 2 (CP2 ; Z/2Z) \u2212\u2192 0\nshows that E 4 (CP2 ) \u223c\n= Z or Z \u00d7 Z/2Z. But the underlying real 2-plane bundle V to the hyperplane\n\u0001\n2\nline bundle over CP has k \u03bb(V ) = p1 V the generator of H 4 (CP2 ). It follows that E 4 (CP2 ) \u223c\n= Z.\n3\nThe argument for (iv) is similar. There is a CW presentation SUN \u223c S \u222a e5 \u222a e7 \u222a * * * ; the\nattaching map \u2202e5 \u2192 S 3 is \u03b7, the suspension of the Hopf map, since \u03c05 SUN \u223c\n= Z. Analogous\ne 4 (CP2 ) \u223c\narguments to (1.12) and (1.13) show E 5 (SUN ) \u223c\n= Z. The invariance\n=E\n= E 5 (S 3 \u222a\u03b7 e5 ) \u223c\nof \u03bd under translation is immediate from the homotopy invariance of cohomology, since SUN is\nconnected.\nLet p : BSUN1 \u00d7 BSUN2 \u2192 BSUN1 +N2 be the direct sum map. Then (1.11) is equivalent\nto the equation p\u2217 (\u03bcN1 +N2 ) = \u03bcN1 + \u03bcN2 . The difference between the two sides is a class c \u2208\n\nE 6 (BSUN1 \u00d7 BSUN2 ) which satisfies j(c) = 0, by the Whitney formula for Chern classes, and so\nfrom (1.3), c = i(b) for some b \u2208 H 6 (BSUN1 \u00d7 BSUN2 ). But the Whitney formula for Chern classes\nalso implies that k(c) = 0, and so b is torsion of order 2 by (1.4). Since H 6 (BSUN1 \u00d7 BSUN2 ) is\ntorsionfree, we deduce that c = 0. A similar argument proves that \u03bc changes sign under conjugation.\nTo prove (iii) we use (1.3) and the vanishing of H 6 (BSpN ) and H 7 (BSpN ) to show that\nj\n\nE 6 (BSpN ) \u2212\n\u2192 H 4 (BSpN ; Z/2Z) is an isomorphism; the latter group is cyclic of order 2. Furthermore, the commutative square\nE 6 (BSU2N )\n\u000f\nE 6 (BSpN )\n\nj\n\nj\n\n/ H 4 (BSU2N ; Z/2Z)\n\u000f\n/ H 4 (BSpN ; Z/2Z)\n7\n\n\fshows that \u03bc \u2208 E 6 (BSU2N ) maps to the generator of E 6 (BSpN ), since j(\u03bc) = w4 maps to the\ngenerator of H 4 (BSpN ; Z/2Z).\nThe statements for SU2 and BSU2 = BSp1 follow directly from the long exact sequence (1.3).\nNext, we promote \u03bc, \u03bd to differential classes, and for that we need7 a smooth model of the\nclassifying spaces. Let H be an infinite dimensional separable complex Hilbert space which carries\na quaternionic structure. Let ESUN be the Stiefel manifold of isometries CN \u2192 H and BSUN the\nquotient by the natural right SUN action. Also, let ESpN be the submanifold of ESU2N of\nisometries C2N \u2192 H which preserve the quaternionic structure and BSpN the quotient by the\nnatural right SpN action. Note the natural map BSpN \u2192 BSU2N and its lift to the universal\nprincipal bundles. The universal bundle ESUN \u2192 BSUN carries a connection \u0398univ defined by the\northogonal complements to the orbits; let \u03a9 denote its curvature. Now it follows easily from (1.3)\nthat E 5 (BSUN ) = 0 and E 4 (SUN ) = 0, so (1.8) implies that to promote \u03bc, \u03bd to differential classes\n\u03bc\u030c \u2208 \u011a 6 (BSUN ), \u03bd\u030c \u2208 \u011a 5 (SUN ) we have only to specify closed differential forms \u03c9\u03bc\u030c \u2208 \u03a96 (BSUN )\nand \u03c9\u03bd\u030c \u2208 \u03a95 (SUN ). Let \u03b8 \u2208 \u03a91 (SUN ; suN ) denote the Maurer-Cartan form, often written \u03b8 =\ng\u22121 dg. Then\n\n(1.14)\n(1.15)\n\n\u2212i\nTr \u03a93 ,\n48\u03c0 3\n\u2212i\n\u03c9\u03bd\u030c =\nTr \u03b8 5 .\n480\u03c0 3\n\n\u03c9\u03bc\u030c =\n\nThe differential form (1.15) is bi-invariant, i.e., invariant under both left and right translation\nin SUN . Since \u03bd is also bi-invariant, it follows that so too is \u03bd\u030c.\nLet P \u2192 M be a principal SUN -bundle with connection \u0398 over a smooth manifold M and\nV \u2192 M the associated rank N hermitian vector bundle with covariant derivative. We define a\ndifferential characteristic class \u03bc\u030c(V ) \u2208 \u011a 6 (M ). For simplicity8 we use the existence of an SUN equivariant map \u03b3 : P \u2192 ESUN which pulls the universal connection \u0398univ back to \u0398. In fact,\nthe space of such classifying maps is contractible and nonempty [DHZ]. A classifying map induces\n\u03b3\u0304 : M \u2192 BSUN , and we set \u03bc\u030c(V ) = \u03b3\u0304 \u2217 (\u03bc\u030c). The \"curvature\" of \u03bc\u030c(V ) is the 6-form\n\n(1.16)\n\n\u03c9\u03bc\u030c(V ) =\n\n\u2212i\nTr(\u03a9V )3 ,\n48\u03c0 3\n\nwhere \u03a9V is the curvature of V .\n7 We refer to [HS,\u00a73.3] for a more elegant treatment of differential characteristic classes which uses the Weyl\nalgebra of polynomials on the Lie algebra in place of differential forms on the classifying space.\n8 We could instead use a classifying map for the bundle and a Chern-Simons form which measures the difference\nbetween \u03b3 \u2217 \u0398univ and \u0398; cf. [HS,\u00a73.3].\n\n8\n\n\fLemma 1.17. \u03b3\u0304 \u2217 (\u03bc\u030c) is independent of the classifying map \u03b3\u0304.\nProof. Since any two classifying maps are homotopic, and the 6-form curvature is independent\nof \u03b3\u0304, the image of \u03b3\u0304 \u2217 (\u03bc\u030c) in A6 (M ) (see (1.8)) is independent of \u03b3\u0304. Let \u0393 : [0, 1] \u00d7 P \u2192 ESUN be\na homotopy of classifying maps of \u0398, and \u0393 : [0, 1] \u00d7 M \u2192 BSUN the quotient homotopy. Then\n\u2217\n\n\u2217\n\n\u03931 (\u03bc\u030c) \u2212 \u03930 (\u03bc\u030c) is in the image of E n\u22121 (M ) \u2297 R/Z, so can be detected by a map of a closed spin\n(n \u2212 1)-manifold f : W n\u22121 \u2192 M . By Stokes' theorem\n\n(1.18)\n\nZ\n\nW\n\n\u2217\nf \u2217 \u03931 (\u03bc\u030c)\n\n\u2212\n\n\u2217\nf \u2217 \u03930 (\u03bc\u030c)\n\nZ\n\n=\n\n[0,1]\u00d7W\n\nid[0,1] \u00d7f\n\n\u0001\u2217\n\n\u2217\n\n\u0393 \u03c9\u03bc\u030c .\n\n\u0001\n\u2217\nBut \u0393 \u03c9\u03bc\u030c \u2208 \u03a96 [0, 1] \u00d7 M is the pullback of (1.16) via projection to M , whence (1.18) vanishes.\n\n\u00a72 Determinant Line Bundles on 4-Manifolds\nWe begin with the setup for geometric index theory [F]. Let X \u2192 S be a fiber bundle with\nfibers compact 4-manifolds. Assume the vertical tangent bundle T (X/S) \u2192 X is endowed with a\nspin structure and Riemannian metric, and suppose too that there is a complementary horizontal\ndistribution. Let \u03a9X/S denote the curvature of the resulting Levi-Civita covariant derivative on\nT (X/S) \u2192 X. We term X \u2192 S with this data a Riemannian spin fiber bundle or a Riemannian\nspin manifold over S. Suppose V \u2192 X is a hermitian vector bundle equipped with a trivialization\nof Det V \u2192 X and a compatible unitary covariant derivative with curvature \u03a9V . Said differently,\nV and its covariant derivative are associated to a principal SUN bundle with connection over X.\nRecall that spinor fields on a Riemannian spin 4-manifold are Z/2Z-graded, the grading termed\n'chirality', and the Dirac operator exchanges the chirality. The geometric data determine a family\nof chiral Dirac operators DX/S (V ) parametrized by S. The chiral Dirac operators map positive\nchirality V -valued spinor fields to negative chirality V -valued spinor fields. Let Det DX/S (V ) \u2192 S\nbe the associated determinant line bundle with its natural metric and covariant derivative. It\ncarries a natural Z/2Z-grading as well: the degree at s \u2208 S is index DXs (V ) (mod 2). We allow\nV to be a virtual bundle, or equivalently a Z/2Z-graded bundle V = V 0 \u2295V 1 , with both Det V 0 and\nDet V 1 trivialized. In this case we write\n\n(2.1)\n\nDet DX/S (V ) = Det DX/S (V 0 ) \u2297 Det DX/S (V 1 )\u2217\n\nand rank V = rank V 0 \u2212 rank V 1 .\n9\n\n\fTheorem 2.2. The isomorphism class of the Z/2Z-graded determinant line bundle with covariant\nderivative is\nZ\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u03bc\u030c(V )\nin \u011a 2 (S).\n(2.3)\nDet DX/S (V ) =\nX/S\n\nRecall that \u03bc\u030c(V ) \u2208 \u011a 6 (X) is the differential characteristic class defined around (1.16); for a Z/2ZR\ngraded bundle V = V 0 \u2295 V 1 set \u03bc\u030c(V ) = \u03bc\u030c(V 0 ) \u2212 \u03bc\u030c(V 1 ). The integral X/S : \u011a 6 (X) \u2192 \u011a 2 (S) uses\nthe spin structure; see (1.6) and [HS,\u00a74.10]. Also, note the splitting\n\u011a 2 (S) \u223c\n= \u021e 2 (S) \u00d7 H 0 (S; Z/2Z)\n\n(2.4)\n\nunder which a graded line bundle with covariant derivative maps separately to the underlying line\nbundle with covariant derivative and the grading. So Theorem 2.2 also determines the ungraded\ndeterminant line bundle with covariant derivative.\nA line bundle with covariant derivative is determined up to isomorphism by all of its holonomies\naround loops. In the language of differential E-theory this is the following.\nLemma 2.5. Let L \u2192 S be a Z/2Z-graded complex line bundle with covariant derivative and\n[L] \u2208 \u011a 2 (S) its isomorphism class. Then [L] is determined by the grading of L in H 0 (S; Z/2Z) and\nby its integral over all loops \u03b3 : S 1 \u2192 S, where S 1 has the bounding spin structure. The integral\nover such a loop is minus the log holonomy (in R/Z).\nProof. By (2.4) it suffices to show that the isomorphism class of the underlying ungraded line\nR\nbundle with covariant derivative is determined by S 1 \u03b3 \u2217 [L] for all \u03b3. Since S 1 has the bounding\nspin structure, we can write S 1 = \u2202D 2 as a spin manifold, and the bundle with covariant derivative\ne \u2192 D 2 . Let \u03a9Le denote its curvature. Then Stokes' theorem in differential\n\u03b3 \u2217 L \u2192 S 1 extends to L\nE-theory implies that\n\nZ\n\n\u03b3 \u2217 [L] \u2261\n\nS1\n\nZ\n\nD2\n\ne\n\n\u03a9L \u2261 \u2212 log holS 1 (\u03b3 \u2217 L) (mod 1).\n\nThat all such integrals determine the image of [L] in \u021e 2 (S) can be seen directly from the exact\nsequence\n0 \u2212\u2192 H 1 (S; R/Z) \u2212\u2192 \u021e 2 (S) \u2212\u2192 \u03a92closed (S)\nin which the last arrow is the curvature: the curvature is determined by the integral around loops\n\u0001\n\u03b3 : S 1 \u2192 S which bound a disk in S, and the integration map H 1 (S; R/Z) \u2192 Hom H1 (S), R/Z is\nan isomorphism.\nThe following lemma reduces the holonomy computation for Det DX/S (V ) to the computation\nof its curvature.\n10\n\n\fLemma 2.6. Suppose Y is a closed spin 5-manifold and V \u2192 Y a rank N complex vector bundle\nwith c1 (V ) = 0. Then there exists a compact spin 6-manifold Z and a rank N complex vector\n\u223c\nbundle W \u2192 Z with c1 (W ) = 0 such that \u2202Z = Y and W\n=V.\n\u2202Z\n\nThe lemma applies to virtual bundles as well: given V = V 0 \u2295 V 1 of rank N and c1 (V ) =\nc1 (V 0 ) \u2212 c1 (V 1 ) = 0 we can add trivial bundles to replace V 1 by a trivializable bundle and so\nV 0 by a bundle (of rank \u2265 N ) with c1 (V 0 ) = 0.\nProof. By Thom's theory this is the assertion that \u03c05 M Spin \u2227 (BSUN )+ vanishes; here X+ is the\nspace X with disjoint basepoint. First, we can drop the '+' since\n\u03c05 M Spin \u2227 (BSUN )+ \u223c\n= \u03c05 M Spin \u2227 BSUN \u00d7 \u03c05 M Spin\nand \u03c05 M Spin = 0. Next, smash the cofiber sequence (1.12) with M Spin to conclude from the long\nexact sequence in homotopy groups that\n\u03c05 M Spin \u2227 BSUN \u223c\n= \u03c05 M Spin \u2227 (S 4 \u222a\u03b7 e6 ) .\nNow smash the cofiber sequence\nS 4 \u2212\u2192 (S 4 \u222a\u03b7 e6 ) \u2212\u2192 S 6\nwith M Spin to obtain the exact sequence\n(2.7)\n\n\u03c06 M Spin \u2227 S 6 \u2212\u2192 \u03c05 M Spin \u2227 S 4 \u2212\u2192 \u03c05 M Spin \u2227 (S 4 \u222a\u03b7 e6 ) \u2212\u2192 \u03c05 M Spin \u2227 S 6 .\n\nWe have \u03c06 M Spin \u2227 S 6 \u223c\n= Z and \u03c05 M Spin \u2227 S 4 \u223c\n= \u03c00 M Spin \u223c\n= Z/2Z. Thus the initial\n= \u03c01 M Spin \u223c\nmap in (2.7) is identified with \u03b7 : \u03c00 M Spin \u2192 \u03c01 M Spin, which is surjective. Since \u03c05 M Spin\u2227S 6 \u223c\n=\n4\n\u03c0\u22121 M Spin = 0, it now follows that \u03c05 M Spin \u2227 (S \u222a\u03b7 e6 ) = 0.\nProof of Theorem 2.2. First, the curvature of Det DX/S (V ) is the integral over X \u2192 S of the 6-form\ncomponent of \u00c2(\u03a9X/S ) ch(\u03a9V ). The flat trivialization of Det V implies Tr \u03a9V = 0, and so the only\ncontribution is\n(2.8)\n\nZ\n\nch3 (\u03a9V ) =\nX/S\n\nBy (1.14) this is the curvature of\n\u011a 2 (S) \u2192 A2 (S) in (1.8).\n\nR\n\nX/S\n\nZ\n\nX/S\n\n1\nc3 (\u03a9V ) =\n2\n\nZ\n\nX/S\n\n\u2212i\nTr(\u03a9V )3 .\n48\u03c0 3\n\n\u03bc\u030c(V ), i.e., the differential form component of its image under\n11\n\n\fBy Lemma 2.5 to prove the theorem it suffices to verify that the grading and the integral of both\nsides of (2.3) over each loop \u03b3 : S 1 \u2192 S agree. The grading of Det DX/S (V ) at s \u2208 S is given by\nthe index mod 2, which by the Atiyah-Singer index theorem and Rohlin's theorem-the \u00c2 genus\nof a closed spin 4-manifold is even-is\n(2.9)\n\nrank V\n\nZ\n\n\u00c2(Xs ) \u2212\n\nXs\n\nZ\n\n\u2212c2 (V ) \u2261\nXs\n\nZ\n\n\u03bc\u030c(V ) (mod 2).\nXs\n\nNow the pullback Y = \u03b3 \u2217 X \u2192 S 1 is a smooth 5-manifold, and it obtains a spin structure from\nthe spin structure of the fibers and the bounding spin structure of the base S 1 . Lemma 2.5\nimplies that the integral of [Det DX/S (V )] is minus the log holonomy, which the holonomy theorem\nfor determinant line bundles [BF] computes as the adiabatic limit of the Atiyah-Patodi-Singer\ninvariant \u03beY (\u03b3 \u2217 V ) (mod 1). The absence of \u03a9X/S in the curvature formula (2.8) implies that we\ncan drop the adiabatic limit. Let Y = \u2202Z and \u03b3 \u2217 V = \u2202W as in Lemma 2.6.

If V \u2192 X has a quaternionic structure, compatible with its hermitian structure\nand covariant derivative, then Det DX/S (V ) has a real structure compatible with its metric and\ncovariant derivative. Equation (2.3) holds and now \u03bc\u030c(V ) has order two by Proposition 1.9(iii).\nA quaternionic structure is a linear map J : V \u2192 V with JJ = \u2212 idV . The spin space on a 4manifold is also quaternionic,9 whence the V -valued spinors are real. The real structure commutes\nwith the Dirac operator, so induces a real structure on all eigenspaces and so on the determinant\nbundle as well. Note that the elements of order two in \u011a 2 (S) form the abelian group H 1 (S; Z/2Z)\u00d7\nH 0 (S; Z/2Z) of isomorphism classes of Z/2Z-graded real line bundles over S.\nFor the real case we have the following.\n9 This\n\nimplies the theorem of Rohlin used in (2.9): the index of the Dirac operator is even since the kernel is\nquaternionic.\n\n12\n\n\fProposition 2.12. If V \u2192 X has a real structure compatible with its hermitian structure and\ncovariant derivative, then Det DX/S (V ) is canonically trivial.\nIn this case the V -valued spinors are quaternionic, so the index is even and hence the determinant\nline bundle has zero grading. The patching construction of the determinant line bundle [F] allows\nus to deduce its triviality from the following lemma.\nProposition 2.13. Let W be a hermitian vector space with compatible quaternionic structure.\nThen Det W is canonically trivial.\nProof. The quaternionic structure J : W \u2192 W induces a real structure det J : Det W \u2192 Det W on\nthe determinant line. There are two real points of norm one on Det W . Let e1 , . . . , em be a unitary\nbasis of W over the quaternions. Then\ne1 \u2227 Je1 \u2227 e2 \u2227 Je2 \u2227 * * * \u2227 em \u2227 Jem \u2208 Det W\nis a real point of norm one. Since the space of such bases is connected, this point in Det W is\nindependent of the basis.\n\n\u00a73 Anomalies in Four-Dimensional Gauge Theories\nWe begin in Minkowski spacetime M 4 . Let S be the two-dimensional complex spin space,\nthe half-spin representation of Spin1,3 \u223c\n= SL2 C. The opposite chirality spin space is its complex\nconjugate S. Let H be a compact Lie group and \u03c1 : H \u2192 Aut(V0 ) a unitary representation. In a\nquantum field theory with an H-gauge field A, spinor fields which transform in the representation \u03c1\ncome in pairs10\n\n\u03c8 : M 4 \u2212\u2192 \u03a0S \u2297 V0\n\u03c8\u0304 : M 4 \u2212\u2192 \u03a0S \u2297 V0\n\nwhich are coupled in the Dirac lagrangian 12 \u03c8\u0304D\n/A \u03c8. The presence of spinor fields of both chiralities\nis dictated by CPT-invariance. It is natural to let V = V0 \u2295 V1 be a Z/2Z-graded representation\nwith associated spinor fields\n\u03c8 : M 4 \u2212\u2192 \u03a0S \u2297 (V0 \u2295 V1 )\n\u03c8\u0304 : M 4 \u2212\u2192 \u03a0S \u2297 (V0 \u2295 V1 )\nNotice that V and \u03a0V = V1 \u2295 V0 lead to the same theory.\nThe Wick rotated Euclidean field theory is defined on the category of Riemannian spin 4manifolds X. The bosonic field is a connection \u0398 on a principal H-bundle P \u2192 X. Gauge\n10 \u03a0S\n\nis the parity reversal of S, the Z/2Z-graded vector space of degree one in which spinor fields take values.\n\n13\n\n\ftransformations-more generally, isomorphisms of principal H-bundles-act as symmetries. So the\n(H)\nspace AX of H-connections on X must be considered as a groupoid, or as a stack.11 In any case\nwe consider families of connections parametrized by a smooth manifold S and allow X and its\nmetric to vary as well. In other words, we couple the gauge theory to gravity, but we treat the\ngauge field and metric as classical background fields. Therefore, in the Euclidean theory we consider Riemannian spin fiber bundles X \u2192 S, as in the beginning of \u00a72, together with a connection\non a principal H-bundle P \u2192 X. The representation \u03c1 : H \u2192 Aut(V) gives rise to an associated\nZ/2Z-graded hermitian vector bundle V = V 0 \u2295V 1 \u2192 X with unitary covariant derivative. Assume\nthat the fibers of X \u2192 S are closed. Then the Euclidean functional integral over the spinor fields is\n\n(3.1)\n\ndet DX/S (V 0 ) * det DX/S (V 1 ) : X \u2212\u2192 Det DX/S (V 0 ) \u2297 Det DX/S (V 1 ).\n\nBut since the spinors are self-conjugate, in fact quaternionic, DX/S (V 1 ) = DX/S (V 1 ) and so\nDet DX/S (V 1 ) \u223c\n= Det DX/S (V 1 ) \u223c\n= Det DX/S (V 1 )\u2217 . Hence the fermionic functional integral (3.1)\nis a section of the determinant bundle Det DX/S (V ) \u2192 X defined in (2.1) and computed in Theorem 2.2.\nThe next step in the quantum field theory is to perform an integral over the space of bosonic\nfields, and one factor in the integrand is the fermionic partition function (3.1). To even set up\nthe integral we need to transform it from a section of a line bundle to a function, i.e., to take the\nratio with a trivialization 1 : S \u2192 Det DX/S (V ). We require that this trivialization be geometric\nin the sense that |1| = 1 and 1 is flat. The anomaly is the obstruction to the existence of a\nflat trivialization; it is measured by [Det DX/S (V )] \u2208 \u011a 2 (S). If the anomaly vanishes, then there\nis a further requirement: the trivialization 1 must be consistent with gluing of 4-manifolds. A\nconsistent choice of 1 is called a setting of the quantum integrand. We remark that the equivalence\nclass of Det DX/S (V ) in \u011a 2 (S) includes its Z/2Z-grading. We are unsure of the physical significance\nof this grading, but believe that a theory is anomalous if the grading is nonzero. Note in this case\nthat the fermionic functional integral (3.1) vanishes, since the Dirac operator has a nonzero kernel.\nTheorem 2.2 applies to compute the anomaly if the determinant of the representation \u03c1 : H \u2192\nAut(V) is one. If this condition does not hold, then the determinant bundle is nontrivial in suitable families where both the metric and gauge field vary: the curvature (2.8) has contributions\nfrom c1 (\u03a9V ). Assume, then, that det \u03c1 = 1. Fix a Riemannian spin 4-manifold X. Any Hconnection on X is pulled back from a universal connection on the classifying space BH, so it\nsuffices to study the family of connections parametrized by S = Map(X, BH). As at the end\nof \u00a71 we construct a smooth model of BH and a universal connection. The representation \u03c1 determines a map \u03c1\u0302 : BH \u2192 BSUN1 \u00d7 BSUN2 , where dim Vq = Nq . Let \u03bc\u030c(\u03c1) \u2208 \u011a 6 (BH) be the\n11 The\n\nlocal model is a smooth infinite dimensional manifold with a smooth action of a compact Lie group.\n\n14\n\n\fpullback \u03c1\u0302\u2217 (\u03bc\u030cN1 \u2212 \u03bc\u030cN2 ) of the universal differential characteristic class. Then if\ne : Map(X, BH) \u00d7 X \u2212\u2192 BH\nis the evaluation map, Theorem 2.2 computes the anomaly to be\nZ\n\n(3.2)\n\n\u2217\n\ne \u03bc\u030c(\u03c1) =\n\nX\n\nZ\n\ne\u2217 \u03c1\u0302\u2217 (\u03bc\u030cN1 \u2212 \u03bc\u030cN2 ).\n\nX\n\nThe curvature of \u03bc\u030c(\u03c1), the 6-form on BH which is the pullback of (1.14) by \u03c1\u0302, is computed by\napplying the symmetric trilinear form\n(3.3)\n\n\u03be1 , \u03be2 , \u03be3 7\u2212\u2192\n\n\u2212i\nTr [\u03c1\u0307(\u03be1 )\u03c1\u0307(\u03be2 )\u03c1\u0307(\u03be3 ) + \u03c1\u0307(\u03be2 )\u03c1\u0307(\u03be1 )\u03c1\u0307(\u03be3 )] ,\n96\u03c0 3\n\n\u03be1 , \u03be2 , \u03be3 \u2208 Lie(H),\n\non the Lie algebra of H to the curvature of the universal connection on BH. This trilinear form is\nthe usual expression for the local anomaly in the physics literature, e.g. [We,\u00a722.3].\nIf \u03bc\u030c(\u03c1) vanishes, then there is no anomaly. This in itself does not provide a choice of trivialization\nof Det DX/S (V ), much less a consistent choice under gluing-a setting of the quantum integrand.\nFor that we would need a refinement of Theorem 2.2 to an isomorphism of Det DX/S (V ) with an\nintegral of a differential function representing \u03bc\u030c(V ). If \u03c1 is a real representation, however, then\nProposition 2.12 does provide a canonical trivialization.\nExample 3.4 (The Standard Model). In this case H = SU3 \u00d7 SU2 \u00d7 U1 , or a finite quotient.\nThe representation \u03c1 is 15-dimensional, and it extends to the representation V \u2295 \u22272 V of SU5 , where\nV = C5 is the standard representation. We compute c3 \u22272 V = c3 V . Hence c3 (V \u2295 \u22272 V ) = 0, and\nfrom Proposition 1.9(ii) we have \u03bc(V \u2295 \u22272 V ) = 0. Thus \u03bc\u030c(V \u2295 \u22272 V ) = 0 as well.\nAn alternative argument: if we add a trivial representation to the 15-dimensional Standard\nModel representation \u03c1, and then the sum extends to the 16-dimensional half-spin representation\nof Spin10 . We claim E 6 (B Spin10 ) = 0, whence \u03bc\u030c(\u03c1) = 0 by (1.11). The claim follows from the long\nexact sequence (1.3); the fact that H 6 (B Spin10 ) = 0; and the fact that \u03b2Sq 2 w4 \u2208 H 7 (B Spin10 ),\noften denoted W7 , is nonzero.\nExample 3.5 (The SU2 anomaly [W3]). Here H = SU2 and \u03c1 is the standard representation,\nwhich is quaternionic. So by Corollary 2.11 the determinant bundle is real and the anomaly is of\norder 2; cf. Proposition 1.9(ii). For X = S 4 , the case considered in [W3], the anomaly is nonzero\nand is more easily computed directly using Bott periodicity than from the formula (3.2) in terms\nof \u03bc\u030c.\nThe main theory of interest in this paper is QCD, the theory of quarks. The gauge group H =\nSUNc , where Nc is the number of \"colors\"; in the real world Nc = 3. Let U = CNc denote the\n15\n\n\ffundamental representation of H. There is another positive integer in the theory, the number of\n\"flavors\" Nf . In the real world there are six flavors of quarks, but as only three of them are light\nin this context Nf is often taken to be equal to three. Our discussion applies to any value of Nf .\nLet W = CNf . The representation \u03c1 of H is the Z/2Z-graded vector space\n(3.6)\n\nV=U\u2297W \u2295 U\u2297W\n\nwhere H acts on U as the fundamental representation and trivially on W. The theory is trivially\nand canonically anomaly-free as V0 = V1 . QCD has a global symmetry group UNf \u00d7 UNf ; the two\nfactors independently act on the two copies of W in (3.6). Our interest is the subgroup G \u00d7 G,\nwhere G = SUNf . We digress now to briefly explain anomalies for global symmetries and gauging\nof global symmetries.\nSuppose we have a quantum field theory with global symmetry group a compact Lie group K.\nIf the space (stack) of fields on a manifold X is FX , then K acts on FX . Let BX be the stack of\nbosonic fields, so there is a vector bundle FX \u2192 BX with fibers the odd vector spaces of fermions.\nThe group K acts on BX compatibly with its action on FX . The functional integral over the\nfermionic fields is a K-invariant section of a K-equivariant Z/2Z-graded hermitian line bundle with\ncovariant derivative on BX . The anomaly is the obstruction to a K-invariant flat trivialization 1.\nIf K acts trivially on BX , then it acts on the line bundle by a character K \u2192 T on each component\nof BX . Here T is the circle group of unit norm complex numbers. If the nonequivariant anomaly\nvanishes, then the anomaly in the global symmetry is measured by these characters. This is the\ncase in QCD, and for the subgroup K = G \u00d7 G = SUNf \u00d7 SUNf of the full global symmetry\ngroup UNf \u00d7 UNf there are no nontrivial characters, whence no anomalies.12\nA gauging of the theory is an extension which includes a connection on a principal K-bundle as\na new field in the theory. Thus in the gauged theory the stack of fields FeX on a manifold X fibers\n(K)\n\n(K)\n\nover the stack AX of K-connections on X. There is a distinguished point of AX -the trivial\n(K)\nconnection with isotropy group K-and we require that the fiber of FeX \u2192 AX at the trivial\nK-connection be identified with the stack of fields FX in the original theory and the action of the\nisotropy group K on this fiber be the original global symmetry. Let BeX denote the stack of bosonic\n\nfields on X in the gauged theory. Then the fermionic anomaly in the gauged theory, which is the\nisomorphism class of a Z/2Z-graded line bundle with covariant derivative over BeX , restricts on the\nfiber BX over the trivial K-connection to the anomaly in the original theory (including the global\nK-action).\n\nQCD has a natural extension which gauges the global G \u00d7 G = SUNf \u00d7 SUNf symmetry. It\nis a four-dimensional gauge theory with gauge group H \u00d7 G \u00d7 G = SUNc \u00d7 SUNf \u00d7 SUNf . The\nanti-diagonal U1 \u2282 UNf \u00d7 UNf acts by the character \u03bb 7\u2192 \u03bbm for m = \u22122Nc Nf Sign(X)/8 \u2212 2Nf k on the\ncomponent where the second Chern class of the principal H = SUNc -bundle is k times the generator of H 4 (X). Here\nSign(X) is the signature of the spin manifold X. So this subgroup is anomalous, though a finite cyclic subgroup is\nnot.\n12 The\n\n16\n\n\frepresentation \u03c1 acts on the vector space (3.6): the group SUNc acts on both copies of U as before,\nthe first factor of SUNf acts on the first copy of W, and the second factor of SUNf acts on the\nsecond copy of W. The stack of bosonic fields in the gauged theory on a fixed 4-manifold X\n(H)\n(G\u00d7G)\nis BeX = AX \u00d7 AX\n. As usual, we consider smooth families of fields, which for the gauged\ntheory is a Riemannian spin fiber bundle X \u2192 S with compact 4-manifolds as fiber and a principal\n\nSUNc \u00d7 (G \u00d7 G) bundle P \u00d7 Q \u2192 X with connection. Let \u03bc\u030c1 (Q), \u03bc\u030c2 (Q) \u2208 \u011a 6 (X) be the differential\ncharacteristic classes associated with the two factors of G.\nProposition 3.7. The anomaly in gauged QCD is\nZ\n\n(3.8)\n\nX/S\n\n\u0001\nNc \u03bc\u030c1 (Q) \u2212 \u03bc\u030c2 (Q) .\n\nThis follows directly from Theorem 2.2, where we use Proposition 1.9(v) to compute the characteristic class of the vector bundle associated to the representation (3.6). (Recall that G \u00d7 G acts\ntrivially on U, which has dimension Nc .) In terms of the stack BeX of bosonic fields, the anomaly\n(G\u00d7G)\n\nis pulled back from AX\n\nand is given by (3.8).\n\nThe symmetry breaking in QCD is deduced from expectation values of bilinear expressions in the\nspinor fields. If (\u03c81 , \u03c82 ) are the spinor fields corresponding to the representation (3.6), then they\nhave the form h\u03c81 , T * \u03c82 i, where the inner product is that in U \u2297 W and T is an element of the Lie\nalgebra of SUNf which acts on U \u2297 W as the identity on U tensor its action on W. The expectation\nvalue is taken at any point of Minkowski spacetime, as it is constant by Poincar\u00e9 invariance. To write\nthis bilinear in the gauged theory, and so implement the symmetry breaking, we need additional\ndata. Namely, there are vector bundles W1 , W2 associated to the two G-connections, and we need\nan isomorphism W1 \u223c\n= W2 , so an isomorphism of the principal G-bundles underlying the two Gconnections. The construction of the gauged effective theory in \u00a74 includes that isomorphism; in\nfact, it is the scalar field in that theory.\nGauged QCD admits new topological terms. In the exponentiated action these have the form\n\n(3.9)\n\nexp 2\u03c0i\u03b81\n\nZ\n\nc2 (Q)1 + 2\u03c0i\u03b82\nX/S\n\nZ\n\nX/S\n\nc2 (Q)2\n\n!\n\n,\n\nwhere c2 (Q)1 , c2 (Q)2 are the degree four characteristic classes corresponding to the two G =\nSUNf factors, and \u03b81 , \u03b82 \u2208 R/Z. The requirement that a fermion bilinear exist implies that\nc2 (Q)1 = c2 (Q)2 , as argued in the previous paragraph, so we have a single topological term with\ncoefficient \u03b8 = \u03b81 + \u03b82 .\nAlthough the gauging of G \u00d7 G leads to an anomaly, there are subgroups which can be gauged\nto give a viable theory.\n17\n\n\fDefinition 3.10. A subgroup \u03b9 : K \u0592\u2192 G \u00d7 G is called anomaly-free if (B\u03b9)\u2217 (\u03bc1 \u2212 \u03bc2 ) \u2208 E 6 (BK)\nvanishes.\nIf K is anomaly-free, then it follows from Proposition 3.7 that the theory obtained by gauging the\nglobal symmetry group K is anomaly-free. Any subgroup of G embedded diagonally in G \u00d7 G\nis clearly anomaly-free. For the subgroup \u03b9 : SU2 \u00d7 {1} \u0592\u2192 G \u00d7 G the pullback (B\u03b9)\u2217 (\u03bc1 \u2212 \u03bc2 ) is\ntorsion of order two. Thus, even though not detected rationally, this subgroup is not anomaly-free.\n(Compare [W1,p. 431].)\n\n\u00a74 The Wess-Zumino-Witten Term in the Low Energy Theory of Pions\nThe low energy dynamics of the pions is described by a \u03c3-model with target (G \u00d7 G)/G, as\nexplained in the introduction. Here, as before, G = SU (N ) with N \u2265 2. The kinetic and mass\nterms have the usual form. Here we give a novel definition of the topological term in the action. As\nthis Wess-Zumino-Witten term is only determined up to integer shifts, we work with its exponential\nin the exponentiated Euclidean action e\u2212SEucl . The space of fields in the \u03c3-model on a manifold X\nis FX = Map(X, G).\nDefinition 4.1. Let X be a closed spin 4-manifold. The WZW factor evaluated on \u03c6 : X \u2192 G is\n\u0013\n\u0012\nZ\n\u2217\nNc \u03c6 \u03bd\u030c .\n(4.2)\nWX (\u03c6) = exp 2\u03c0i\nX\n\nRecall that \u03bd\u030c \u2208 \u011a 5 (G) is the differential E-class defined in Proposition 1.9(iv) and (1.15). Note\nR\nthat the integral X : \u011a 5 (X) \u2192 \u011a 1 (point) takes values in R/Z, as follows immediately from (1.7).\nSo WX (\u03c6) is a well-defined element of C with unit norm. The factor of Nc is put to match the high\nenergy theory; see Proposition 4.17 below. Since \u03bd\u030c is invariant under left and right translations\nby G, the WZW-factor (4.2) is also (G \u00d7 G)-invariant. If X = \u2202Z is the boundary of a compact\nspin 5-manifold Z, and \u03c6 : X \u2192 G extends to \u03a6 : Z \u2192 G, then Stokes' theorem for differential\nE-theory implies\n(4.3)\n\n\u0012\n\nWX (\u03c6) = exp 2\u03c0iNc\n\nZ\n\n\u2217\n\n\u03a6 \u03c9\u03bd\u030c\nZ\n\n\u0013\n\n\u0012\n\n= exp Nc\n\nZ\n\nZ\n\n\u0013\n1\n\u2217 5\nTr(\u03a6 \u03b8) ,\n240\u03c0 2\n\nwhich is the usual formula in the physics literature. (Recall that \u03b8 = g\u22121 dg is the Maurer-Cartan\nform on G = SUNf .) The signature of X is an obstruction to the existence of Z, so (4.3) cannot\nserve as a definition of the WZW factor.13\nWe proceed to verify properties (i)\u2013(iv) from the introduction. To demonstrate that (4.2) depends on a spin structure, we compute the dependence explicitly.\n13 However,\n\nthe square WX (\u03c6)2 is expressed in terms of ordinary differential cohomology, and since H4 (G) = 0 it\nmay defined via an integral of a differential form over a bounding 5-chain.\n\n18\n\n\fProposition 4.4. Let \u03b4 \u2208 H 1 (X; Z/2Z) be the difference between two isomorphism classes of spin\nstructures on X with the same underlying orientation. Then the ratio of the WZW factors (4.2)\ncomputed with the two spin structures is \u00b11 according to the value of\nNc \u03b4 \u2323 \u03c6\u2217 h3 [X]\n\n(4.5)\n\n\u2208\n\nZ/2Z,\n\nwhere h3 is the nonzero element of H 3 (G; Z/2Z) and [X] \u2208 H4 (X) is the fundamental class.\nProof. Let e denote the Anderson dual theory [HS,Appendix B], [FMS1,Appendix B] to E. Then\ne0 (point) \u223c\n= Z, e\u22121 (point) \u223c\n= Z/2Z, and all other groups vanish.

The cohomology theory e is multiplicative, that is, e is a ring spectrum. This can be seen in several ways. First, the cohomology\nclass represented by (4.7) is primitive, and so it follows that the fiber e is a ring spectrum. We\ncan also identify e as a Postnikov truncation of connective ko-theory, and again it follows that e is\na ring. More concretely, the zero space is the classifying space of the category of Z-graded real\nlines, and the latter is a ring: addition is the tensor product of lines, and the multiplication of\n2\n1\nL1 , L2 in degrees d1 , d2 puts L\u2297d\n\u2297 L\u2297d\nin degree d1 d2 . One can also see e as a truncation of the\n1\n2\nsphere spectrum, so identify its points as framed 0-manifolds; the sum is then disjoint union and\nthe product is Cartesian product. It follows that E, the Anderson dual of e, is a module over the\n\nring e.\nSuppose V \u2192 X is a real vector bundle of rank N over a space X. Then (4.6) leads to the long\nexact sequence of cohomology groups\n(4.8)\n***\n\n/ H N +1 (V ; Z/2Z)cv\nO\n\ns\n\n/ eN (V )cv\n\n/ H N (V ; Z)cv Sq\n\n2\n\n\u25e6r\n\n/ H N +2 (V ; Z/2Z)cv\nO\n\n\u223c\n= U\n\n\u223c\n= U\n\nH 1 (X; Z/2Z)\n\nH 2 (X; Z/2Z)\n\n/ ***\n\nHere 'cv' denotes compact vertical supports and the vertical arrows are Thom isomorphisms. Assume V is oriented with Thom class U \u2208 H N (V ; Z)cv , and let U \u2208 H N (V ; Z/2Z)cv be the mod 2\n19\n\n\fThom class. Then (Sq 2 \u25e6 r)(U ) = U w2 (V ), where w2 (V ) \u2208 H 2 (X; Z/2Z) is the second StiefelWhitney class. Hence a spin structure on V -a trivialization of w2 (V )-induces a lift Ue \u2208 eN (V )cv\nof U , a Thom class in e-theory. Lifts differ by U \u03b4 for \u03b4 \u2208 H 1 (X; Z/2Z).\nTurning to the proposition, let \u03c0 : V \u2192 X be the normal bundle to an embedding X \u0592\u2192 RN +4 ,\nlet Ue be the e-Thom class for some spin structure, and \u01d3e a lift to a differential Thom class in\ne-theory [HS]. The integral of a class \u03b2\u030c \u2208 \u011a 5 (X) is computed as the product\n\u01d3e * \u03c0 \u2217 \u03b2\u030c\n\n\u2208\n\n\u011a N +5 (RN +4 ) \u223c\n= R/Z.\n\nIf \u03b4 \u2208 H 1 (X; Z/2Z) is a change of spin structure, then Ue changes by s(U \u03b4) in the sequence (4.8).\nNow there is an inclusion\neN \u22121 (V ; R/Z)cv\n\n\u001f\u007f\n\nf\n\n/ \u011bN (V )cv\n\nof \"flat\" elements in differential e-theory.

Then the change in the product \u01d3e * \u03c0 \u2217 \u03b2\u030c depends only on the image j(\u03b2) of \u03b2\u030c\n\u0001\nj\nunder \u011a 5 (X) \u2212\n\u2192 E 5 (X) \u2212\n\u2192 H 3 (X; Z/2Z): it is f U \u03b4 * \u03c0 \u2217 j(\u03b2) \u2208 \u011a N +5 (RN +4 ) \u223c\n= R/Z.

By shifting the Moore space for R/Z in the wedge, this is equivalent to showing that\nthe module map e \u2227 ER/Z \u2192 ER/Z induces the nonzero map \u03c01 e \u2297 \u03c0\u22121 ER/Z \u2192 \u03c00 ER/Z . But since\nER/Z is the Pontrjagin dual of e, this is obtained by applying Hom(\u2212, R/Z) to the multiplication\n\u03c01 e : \u03c00 e \u2192 \u03c01 e, and the latter is nonzero.\nWe now turn to property (ii) in the introduction. Let Y be a compact spin 3-manifold, and\nconsider canonical quantization of the \u03c3-model on Y . The space of classical solutions of the \u03c3model on R \u00d7 Y with its Lorentz metric is the space of solutions to a wave equation, which (at\nleast formally) is the space of Cauchy data. The latter is identified with the tangent bundle\nof Map(Y, G). It carries a symplectic structure, and the zero-section Map(Y, G) is lagrangian.\n14 The\n\ndegree shift in the first term is explained with chain complexes: Z \u2192 R with Z in degree \u22121 is quasiisomorphic to R/Z in degree zero\n\n20\n\n\fWithout the WZW factor the Hilbert space would, at least formally, be the space of L2 functions\non Map(Y, G). In particular, it would only consist of bosonic states. The WZW factor changes\nthe symplectic structure of T Map(Y, G) in a geometric manner: the normalized curvature of a\nhermitian line bundle with covariant derivative pulled back from Map(Y, G) is added. Let\ne : Map(Y, G) \u00d7 Y \u2212\u2192 G\nbe the evaluation map. Then the isomorphism class of this line bundle may be written\nZ\n\n(4.9)\n\nNc e\u2217 \u03bd\u030c\n\nY\n\n\u2208\n\n\u0001\n\u011a 2 Map(Y, G) .\n\nThe important point for us is that \u011a 2 parametrizes Z/2Z-graded line bundles with covariant derivative. The quantum Hilbert space is now the space of sections of this line bundle, so it too is\nZ/2Z-graded. The Z/2Z-grading of the quantum Hilbert space reflects statistics of states: even\ndegree states are bosonic and odd degree states are fermionic. More precisely, the grading of (4.9)\nat \u03c6 \u2208 Map(Y, G) is\n(4.10)\n\nZ\n\n\u2217\n\nNc \u03c6 j(\u03bd) \u2261\nY\n\nZ\n\nY\n\nNc \u03c6\u2217 h3 \u2261 Nc deg2 (\u03c6)\n\n\u2208\n\nZ/2Z,\n\nwhere deg2 (\u03c6) is the mod 2 degree of \u03c6 : Y \u2192 G, the homology class of \u03c6 in H3 (G; Z/2Z) \u223c\n= Z/2Z.\n3\n(Recall that h3 (mod 2) is the generator of H (G; Z/2Z); cf. (1.10).) In physical term the integer\ndegree is identified with the baryon number , and (4.10)-the statistics formula for solitons which\nis an immediate consequence of Definition 4.1-matches the formula derived from physics [W2].\nProperty (iii) of the introduction is evident: our definition works for G = SU (2) since \u03bd\u030c is a\nnonzero element of order two and (4.10) is still valid. So the WZW factor encodes the statistics of\nsolitons.\nThe remainder of this section is devoted to property (iv). To that end we construct an extension\nof the \u03c3-model with WZW factor (4.2) when the global (G \u00d7 G) symmetry is gauged. (See the\ndiscussion preceding Proposition 3.7 for generalities on gauging.) As the gauged extensions of the\nkinetic and mass terms are straightforward and anomaly-free, we only consider the WZW factor.\nThe fields FeX in the gauged theory on a Riemannian spin 4-manifold X are a connection \u0398 on a\nprincipal (G \u00d7 G)-bundle Q \u2192 X and a (G \u00d7 G)-equivariant map \u03c6 : Q \u2192 G, i.e., a section \u03c6 of\n(G\u00d7G)\nthe associated fiber bundle GQ = Q \u00d7(G\u00d7G) G \u2192 X with fiber G. Note the fibering FeX \u2192 A\nX\n\nas required by the general theory. If the class \u03bd\u030c \u2208 \u011a 5 (G) extended to a class in \u011a 5 (GQ ), then\n\n(4.2) would be valid with this extended class replacing \u03bd\u030c, and there would be an anomaly-free\ngauging of the WZW factor. But such an extension does not exist, and so the gauged theory is\nmore subtle-and anomalous.\n21\n\n\fEven the topological class \u03bd \u2208 E 5 (G) does not extend, and to measure the obstruction we work\nuniversally. Let E \u2192 B(G \u00d7 G) = BG \u00d7 BG be the fiber bundle\n(4.11)\n\n\u03c0 : E = GE(G\u00d7G) = E(G \u00d7 G)(G\u00d7G) G \u2212\u2192 B(G \u00d7 G).\n\nThe bundle E is the quotient of EG \u00d7 EG by the diagonal G-action, so is homotopy equivalent\nto BG; the projection to BG \u00d7 BG is homotopy equivalent to the diagonal BG \u2192 BG \u00d7 BG.\nRecall that ordinary cohomology is defined in terms of cochains and a differential. A cocycle is a\ncochain whose differential vanishes, and the cohomology is the quotient of cocycles by differentials\nof cochains. The entire theory is Z-graded and the differential has degree one. In generalized\ncohomology there are analogous notions, and for now we simply call them 'E-cochains', etc.; in \u00a75\nwe give proper definitions.\nTheorem 4.12. There is an E-cochain \u03b1 of degree 5 on the total space E of (4.11) which satisfies:\n(i) the restriction of \u03b1 to a fiber has zero E-differential and represents \u03bd \u2208 E 5 (G);\n(ii) the E-differential of \u03b1 is the pullback of an E-cocycle of degree 6 on B(G\u00d7G) which represents\n\u0001\n\u03bc1 \u2212 \u03bc2 \u2208 E 6 B(G \u00d7 G) .\n\nWe term \u03b1 a transgressing E-cochain and say that \u03bd transgresses to \u03bc1 \u2212 \u03bc2 . Transgression in\nordinary cohomology is related to the Leray-Serre spectral sequence [BT,\u00a718], but that tool is\nnot available for E-cohomology. Theorem 4.12 has a restatement in terms of Borel equivariant E5\ncohomology: the E-cohomology class \u03bd \u2208 E 5 (G) does not has an equivariant extension to EG\u00d7G\n(G).\n6\nThe existence of such an extension is obstructed by \u03bc1 \u2212 \u03bc2 \u2208 EG\u00d7G\n(point). Then \u03b1 may be\nregarded as a (G \u00d7 G)-equivariant E-cochain on G. We defer the proof of Theorem 4.12 and further\ndiscussion to \u00a75.\n\nTo define the gauged WZW factor we need an extension of Theorem 4.12 to differential E-theory.\nTheorem 4.13. There is an \u011a-cochain \u03b1\u030c of degree 5 on the total space E of (4.11) which satisfies:\n(i) the restriction of \u03b1\u030c to a fiber has zero \u011a-differential and represents \u03bd\u030c \u2208 \u011a 5 (G);\n(ii) the \u011a-differential of \u03b1\u030c is the pullback of an \u011a-cocycle of degree 6 on B(G\u00d7G) which represents\n\u0001\n\u03bc\u030c1 \u2212 \u03bc\u030c2 \u2208 \u011a 6 B(G \u00d7 G) .\n\nThe proof is in \u00a75. The main idea in Theorem 4.13 beyond Theorem 4.12 is that the differential\n\nform \u03c9\u03bc\u030c is a transgression of \u03c9\u03bd\u030c in the universal bundle EG \u2192 BG. The transgressing form is a\n5-form on EG, the Chern-Simons form. We then construct a 5-form (5.16) on E whose de Rham\n\u0001\ndifferential is the pullback of \u03c9\u03bc\u030c1 \u2212 \u03c9\u03bc\u030c2 \u2208 \u03a96 B(G \u00d7 G) . In fact, there are different equivalence\n\nclasses of transgressing \u011a-cochains \u03b1\u030c which differ by the inclusion of a topological term in the\ngauged WZW model.\n(G\u00d7G)\n\nWe need one more maneuver to define the gauged WZW factor. Recall that AX\nis a stack\nrepresented by the groupoid G1 in which an object (Q, \u0398) is a connection \u0398 on a principal (G \u00d7 G)bundle Q \u2192 X. A morphism (Q, \u0398) \u2192 (Q\u2032 , \u0398\u2032 ) is a G \u00d7 G-equivariant map \u03c6 : Q \u2192 Q\u2032 such that\n22\n\n\f(G\u00d7G)\n\n\u03c6\u2217 \u0398\u2032 = \u0398. We replace G1 by an equivalent groupoid G2 ; it also represents the stack AX\n. An\nobject (Q, \u0398, \u03b3) in G2 is a triple where \u03b3 : Q \u2192 E(G \u00d7 G) is a (G \u00d7 G)-equivariant map which\nclassifies the connection \u0398 on Q. In other words, \u03b3 \u2217 \u0398univ = \u0398, where \u0398univ is the universal\nconnection on E(G \u00d7 G) \u2192 B(G \u00d7 G). (As in the construction at the end of \u00a71, we can avoid\nthe condition \u03b3 \u2217 \u0398univ = \u0398 by including a Chern-Simons term.) Morphisms in G2 are described\nat the end of \u00a75. The important point is that the space of classifying maps \u03b3 for fixed (Q, \u0398) is\ncontractible and nonempty. In essence we adjoin this contractible choice as a new field and posit a\nsymmetry which makes it inessential (auxiliary).\nA field in the gauged \u03c3-model is, therefore, a principal (G\u00d7G)-bundle Q \u2192 X with connection \u0398,\na classifying map \u03b3 : Q \u2192 E(G \u00d7 G) for \u0398, and a section \u03c6 of the associated bundle GQ \u2192 X with\nfiber G. The classifying map \u03b3 induces a classifying map \u03b3\u0303 : GQ \u2192 E.\nDefinition 4.14. The gauged WZW factor is\n\n(4.15)\n\n\u0013\n\u0012\nZ\n\u2217 \u2217\nf\nNc \u03c6 \u03b3\u0303 \u03b1\u030c .\nWX (Q, \u0398, \u03b3, \u03c6) = exp 2\u03c0i\nX\n\nThe \u011a-cochain \u03b3\u0303 \u2217 \u03b1\u030c on GQ is the gauged extension of the cocycle \u03bd\u030c on G, so (4.15) is a natural\ngeneralization of (4.2). We discuss the well-definedness of this definition at the end of \u00a75.\nTo analyze this definition we work in smooth families. Let X \u2192 S be a Riemannian spin fiber\nbundle with compact 4-manifolds as fibers, Q \u2192 X a principal (G \u00d7 G)-bundle with connection \u0398,\n\u03b3 : Q \u2192 E(G \u00d7 G) a classifying map for the connection, and \u03c6 a section of GQ \u2192 X. The gauged\nWZW factor is now an integral over the fibers\n\n(4.16)\n\nfX (Q, \u0398, \u03b3, \u03c6) = exp 2\u03c0i\nW\n\nZ\n\n\u2217 \u2217\n\n!\n\nNc \u03c6 \u03b3\u0303 \u03b1\u030c ,\nX/S\n\nand the result is an \u011a-cochain on S of degree 1. Its \u011a-differential is an \u011a-cocycle of degree 2,\nso represents a class in \u011a 2 (S). Now from Theorem 4.13(ii) the \u011a-differential of the integrand\nrepresents the \u011a-cohomology class Nc \u03b3\u0304 \u2217 (\u03bc\u030c1 \u2212 \u03bc\u030c2 ), and so by Stokes' theorem the \u011a-differential\nof (4.16) is\nZ\nZ\n\u0001\n\u2217\nNc \u03bc\u030c1 (Q) \u2212 \u03bc\u030c2 (Q) ,\nNc \u03b3\u0304 (\u03bc\u030c1 \u2212 \u03bc\u030c2 ) =\nX/S\n\nX/S\n\nin terms of the differential characteristic class \u03bc\u030c defined around (1.16). Recall that an \u011a-cocycle\nof degree 2 may be represented as a Z/2Z-graded hermitian line bundle with unitary covariant\nderivative. Then a \u011a-cochain of degree 1 whose differential is that cocycle may be represented as\na not-necessarily-flat section of this bundle of unit norm. That section (4.15) is part of the gauged\n\u03c3-model action, and therefore the line bundle is the anomaly. This proves the following.\n23\n\n\fProposition 4.17. The anomaly in the gauged \u03c3-model with WZW factor is\nZ\n\n(4.18)\n\nX/S\n\n\u0001\nNc \u03bc\u030c1 (Q) \u2212 \u03bc\u030c2 (Q) .\n\nThe agreement of (3.8) and (4.18) is the 't Hooft anomaly matching. In terms of the stack of\n(G\u00d7G)\n(bosonic) fields, which is a fibering FeX \u2192 AX\nover the stack of (G \u00d7 G)-connections, the\nclassical action with gauged WZW factor is a section of a line bundle over FeX , and that line bundle\n(G\u00d7G)\n\nis pulled back from AX\n\n. It is the anomaly in the gauged \u03c3-model, and its isomorphism class is\n\ncomputed by Proposition 4.17. This completes the verification of property (iv) of the introduction.\nThe existence of a section \u03c6 of GQ \u2192 X implies a topological restriction on the G \u00d7 G bundle\nQ \u2192 X, namely that the two constituent G-bundles Q1 \u2192 X and Q2 \u2192 X be isomorphic as\ntopological principal bundles. (A section of the associated (G \u00d7 G)/G bundle is equivalent to a\nreduction of structure group of Q to the diagonal G \u2282 G \u00d7 G.) This is precisely the condition\nin QCD to define the fermion bilinear; see the discussion preceding (3.9). It also implies that the\ntopological anomaly in Proposition 4.17 vanishes, but there may still be a geometric anomaly: the\nG bundles Q1 , Q2 need not be isomorphic as bundles with connection.\n\n\u00a75 Transgression\nWe recommend [DK,\u00a76] as an introduction to the topology used in this section.\nThe cochains used to define ordinary cohomology are replaced in a generalized cohomology\ntheory E by maps into the representing spectrum {En }. Recall that En is a pointed topological\nspace and the spectrum comes equipped with maps \u03a3En \u2192 En+1 . An 'E-cocycle' (as used in \u00a74)\nof degree n on a topological space X is simply a map X \u2192 En . Homotopic maps are considered\nequivalent, and the E-cohomology group E n (X) is the set of homotopy classes (1.1). An 'E-cochain'\nof degree n on X is a based map\n(5.1)\n\nCX \u2212\u2192 En+1\n\nfrom the unreduced cone15 on X; its 'E-differential' is the restriction to X \u2282 CX. If that restriction\nis trivial-maps to the basepoint \u2217 of En+1 -then (5.1) factors to a based map \u03a3X \u2192 En+1 , and\n15 The\n\nunreduced cone on X is the pointed space\nCX = [0, 1] \u00d7 X\n\n\u000e\n\n{1} \u00d7 X\n\nwith basepoint {1} \u00d7 X. Note X \u2282 CX as {0} \u00d7 X and CX/X is the unreduced suspension \u03a3X. As X does not\nhave a basepoint, the notation for suspension is unambiguous.\n\n24\n\n\fby adjunction it is equivalent to a map X \u2192 \u03a9En+1 \u2243 En , so represents a class in E n (X). If\nA \u2282 X is a subspace, then a class in the relative cohomology group E n (X, A) is represented by a\nmap X \u222a CA \u2192 En .\nWe now define transgression in generalized cohomology.\ni\n\n\u03c0\n\nDefinition 5.2. Let F \u2212\n\u2192E \u2212\n\u2192 B be a fibration. Then \u03bd \u2208 E n (F ) is related by transgression to\n\u03bc \u2208 E n+1 (B) if there exists \u03c3 \u2208 E n+1 (E, F ) and \u03bc0 \u2208 E n+1 (B, b0 ) such that under the maps\n\n(5.3)\n\nE n (F )\n\n\u03b4\n\n/ E n+1 (E, F ) o\n\n\u03c0\u2217\n\nE n+1 (B, b0 )\n\nj\n\n/ E n+1 (B)\n\nwe have \u03c3 = \u03b4(\u03bd) = \u03c0 \u2217 (\u03bc0 ) and \u03bc = j(\u03bc0 ).\nAll spaces are pointed; the basepoint of B is b0 , and \u03c0 \u22121 (b0 ) = F is the fiber of \u03c0. The map \u03b4 is the\nconnecting homomorphism in the long exact sequence of the pair (E, F ), and j is the homomorphism\nwhich forgets the basepoint.16 The set of transgressive elements in E n (F ) forms a subgroup, and\ntransgression is only well-defined into a quotient of E n+1 (B). The relation of Definition 5.2 with\nthe description in Theorem 4.12 is the following.\ni\n\n\u03c0\n\nLemma 5.4. Let F \u2212\n\u2192 E \u2212\n\u2192 B be a fibration. Then \u03bd \u2208 E n (F ) is related by transgression\nto \u03bc \u2208 E n+1 (B) if and only if there exists a map \u03b1 : CE \u2192 En+1 such that\n(i) the restriction of \u03b1 to F \u2282 CF \u2282 CE is trivial and the restriction of \u03b1 to CF factors through\na map \u03a3F \u2192 En+1 which represents \u03bd;\n(ii) the restriction of \u03b1 to E \u2282 CE is the pullback under \u03c0 of a based map B \u2192 En+1 which\nrepresents \u03bc.\nProof. The class \u03c3 in Definition 5.2 is represented by a map c : E \u222a CF \u2192 En+1 . Because \u03c3 = \u03b4(\u03bd),\nit extends to c\u0303 : CE \u222aCF \u2243 \u03a3F \u2192 En+1 , and the extension represents \u03bd. Also, because \u03c3 = \u03c0 \u2217 (\u03bc0 ),\nthe restriction of c to E is pulled back from a based map G \u2192 En+1 , and in particular is trivial\non F \u2282 E. By a homotopy we can assume that c is trivial on CF . Then the restriction \u03b1 : CE \u2192\nEn+1 of c\u0303 to CE satisfies (i) and (ii). The converse is proved by gluing the trivial map on CF to \u03b1.\nIn our application the inclusion i : F \u2192 E is null homotopic, and it is convenient to specify a\nnull homotopy as follows.\ni\n\n\u03c0\n\nLemma 5.5. Let F \u2212\n\u2192E \u2212\n\u2192 B be a fibration, \u03c6 : F \u2032 \u2192 F a continuous map, and H : [0, 1]\u00d7F \u2032 \u2192 E\na null homotopy of i \u25e6 \u03c6. Then a section s : F \u2192 F \u2032 of \u03c6 determines a null homotopy H \u25e6 s of i.\nFurthermore, the map \u03c0 : (E, F ) \u2192 (B, b0 ) is homotopy equivalent to the based map\n(5.6)\n16 E \u2022 (B, b )\n0\n\n\u03c0 \u2228 (\u03c0 \u25e6 H \u25e6 s) : E \u2228 \u03a3F \u2212\u2192 B.\ne \u2022 (B).\nis the reduced E-cohomology of B, often denoted E\n\n25\n\n\fSome definitions: H is a null homotopy of i \u25e6 f means H0 = i \u25e6 \u03c6 and H1 maps to the basepoint\nof E. The section s satisfies \u03c6 \u25e6 s = idF . The wedge X \u2228 Y of pointed spaces X, Y is the union\nalong the basepoints. The map \u03c0 \u25e6 H \u25e6 s : \u03a3F \u2192 B sends (t, f ) \u2208 \u03a3F to (\u03c0 \u25e6 Ht \u25e6 s)(f ). The proof\nof Lemma 5.5 is straightforward.\nWe apply these ideas first to the classifying space of G = SUN , N \u2265 2. Now 'E' denotes the\nspecific cohomology theory described in \u00a71.\nProposition 5.7. The classes \u03bd \u2208 E 5 (G) and \u03bc \u2208 E 6 (BG) are related by transgression in the\ni\n\n\u03c0\n\nuniversal fibration G \u2212\n\u2192 EG \u2212\n\u2192 BG.\nProof. Let \u03c6 = s : G \u2192 G be the identity map, K a null homotopy of idEG , and H = K \u25e6 i \u25e6 \u03c6.\nThe map \u03b4 in (5.3) is obtained by applying [ * , E6 ] to the inclusion \u03a3F \u2192 E \u2228 \u03a3F . (Recall that\n[X, Y ] is the set of homotopy classes of maps X \u2192 Y .) Set\n\n(5.8)\n\n\u03c8 = \u03c0 \u25e6 H \u25e6 s : \u03a3G \u2212\u2192 BG\n\nto be the map in (5.6).

Parts (ii)\n\u2217\nand (iv) of Proposition 1.9 reduce us to showing \u03c8H\n(c3 ) = h5 , which is a standard transgression in\nthe theory of characteristic classes in ordinary cohomology.\n\nWe remark that the map (5.8) classifies the bundle on \u03a3G whose clutching function is idG : G \u2192\nG; this is clear from its definition as \u03c0 \u25e6 H \u25e6 s = \u03c0 \u25e6 K \u25e6 i. It is also the first stage of the Milnor\nconstruction of BG.\nProof of Theorem 4.12. From Lemma 5.4 to produce the desired map \u03b1 : CE \u2192 En+1 it suffices\nto show that \u03bd and \u03bc1 \u2212 \u03bc2 are related by transgression in the fibration (4.11). Consider the\n26\n\n\fcommutative diagram\n(5.9)\n\nE(G \u00d7 G)\nRRR\nggg3\ng\ng\nRRR \u03c0\u2032\ng\nH ggggg\nRRR\nq\ng\ng\ng\nRRR\ng\ngg\ng\nR(\ng\ng\n\u000f\ng\n\u000e\n\u000e\n\u000e\nggg \u03c6 /\ni\n\u03c0 /\n/\n(G\n\u00d7\nG)\nG\nE(G\n\u00d7\nG)\nG\nE(G\n\u00d7 G) G \u00d7 G\nG \u00d7 GfM\nMMM\nMMM\n\u03c7\ns MMM\nMM \u000f\ni\n\u03c0\n/E\n/ BG \u00d7 BG\nG\n\u2032\n\nIn this diagram \u03c6 and q are quotient maps; s(g) = (g, e), where e \u2208 G is the identity element;\nthe diffeomorphism \u03c7 is given as \u03c7(g1 , g2 ) = g1 g2\u22121 , which is well-defined on left cosets of G;\nand H \u2032 is the null homotopy obtained from a null homotopy K \u00d7 K of EG \u00d7 EG (see the proof\nof Proposition 5.7 above). Then H = q \u25e6 H \u2032 is a null homotopy of i \u25e6 \u03c6. It follows that \u03c0 \u25e6\nH \u25e6 s : \u03a3G \u2192 BG \u00d7 BG in (5.6) is \u03c8 \u00d7 \u2217, where \u03c8 is the map defined in (5.8) and \u2217 is the\nconstant map to the basepoint. Note that E \u2243 BG and \u03c0 is homotopy equivalent to the diagonal\n\u2206 : BG \u2192 BG \u00d7 BG. From the proof of Proposition 5.7 we see that \u03bc1 \u2212 \u03bc2 \u2208 E 6 (BG \u00d7 BG) pulls\nback to \u03bd \u2208 E 5 (G) \u223c\n= E 6 (\u03a3G) \u2282 E 6 (E \u2228 \u03a3G) under\n\nE \u2228 \u03a3G\n\n\u2243\n\n/ BG \u2228 \u03a3G\n\n\u2206\u2228(\u03c8\u00d7\u2217)\n\n/ BG \u00d7 BG ,\n\nand this completes the proof.\nAs a preliminary to proving Theorem 4.13 we discuss some generalities about differential co\u0001\nhomology [HS,\u00a74]. Let C \u2022 (X; R), \u03b4 denote the singular cochain complex of a space X. In the\n\ndifferential theory we need to fix cocycles \u03b9n \u2208 C n (En ; R) which represent the map 12 k : En \u2192 HRn ;\n\u000e\nsee (1.4). These cocycles must satisfy the compatibility condition s\u2217 \u03b9n+1 ZS 1 = \u03b9n , where s is the\n\ncomposition S 1 \u00d7 En \u2192 \u03a3En \u2192 En+1 and ZS 1 is a fixed fundamental cycle, paired with s\u2217 \u03b9n+1 by\nslant product.\nDefinition 5.10. A differential E-function of degree n on a smooth manifold M is a triple \u03b2\u030c =\n\n(\u03b2, h, \u03c9) consisting of a continuous map \u03b2 : M \u2192 En , a closed differential form \u03c9 of degree n, and\na cochain h \u2208 C n\u22121 (M ; R) which satisfies\n(5.11)\n\n\u03b4h = \u03c9 \u2212 \u03b2 \u2217 \u03b9n .\n\nIn (5.11) the differential form \u03c9-termed the curvature of \u03b2\u030c-is regarded as a singular cocycle by\nintegration. A differential E-function was termed an '\u011a-cocycle' in \u00a74. A homotopy (or morphism)\n27\n\n\fis a differential E-function of degree n on [0, 1] \u00d7 M whose curvature is pulled back from M under\nprojection.17 The set of equivalence classes under the induced equivalence relation is the differential\nE-cohomology \u011a n (M ). Note that \u03c9 in \u03b2\u030c = (\u03b2, h, \u03c9) is an invariant of the class of \u03b2\u030c in \u011a n (M ).\nAnalogous definitions apply to any generalized cohomology theory E. The fundamental cocycles \u03b9n\nthen have coefficients in the vector space E 0 (point; R).\nTo discuss transgression we also need a notion of '\u011a-cochain'.\nDefinition 5.12. A coned differential E-function of degree n on a smooth manifold M is a\ntriple \u03b1\u030c = (\u03b1, k, \u03b7) consisting of a continuous map \u03b1 : CM \u2192 En+1 , a differential form \u03b7 \u2208 \u03a9n (M ),\nand a cochain k \u2208 C n\u22121 (M ; R). It trivializes the differential E-function \u03b2\u030c = (\u03b2, h, \u03c9) of degree n+1,\nwhere\n\u03b2=\u03b1\n(5.13)\n\nM\n\n\u03c9 = d\u03b7\n\n\u000e\nh = \u03b7 \u2212 \u03b1\u2217 \u03b9n+1 Z[0,1] \u2212 \u03b4k.\n\nIn \u00a74 we termed \u03b2\u030c the '\u011a-differential' of \u03b1\u030c. The slant product in (5.13) is computed after pullback\nby the collapse [0, 1] \u00d7 M \u2192 CM , and the cycle Z[0,1] pushes to ZS 1 under the collapse [0, 1] \u2192 S 1 .\nA homotopy is a coned differential E-function (A, K, \u039e) of degree n on [0, 1] \u00d7 M such that the\nrestriction of A to [0, 1] \u00d7 M \u2282 [0, 1] \u00d7 CM is constant, \u039e is pulled back from M under projection,\n\u0001\nand H \u2208 C n [0, 1] \u00d7 M ; R defined as (see (5.13))\n(5.14)\n\n\u000e\nH = \u039e \u2212 A\u2217 \u03b9n+1 Z[0,1] \u2212 \u03b4K\n\nis also pulled back from M under projection. The set of equivalence classes of coned differential\nE-functions which trivialize a fixed differential E-function of degree n + 1 is a torsor for \u011a n (M ).\nIntegration of differential functions is defined in [HS,\u00a74.10]. Our definition (4.16) of the WZW factor requires that integration be extended to coned differential functions as well. The main step is\nsimply extending the orientation map, called '\u03bc' in [HS,\u00a74.10], to the path spaces in the spectrum.18\nProof of Theorem 4.13. We must construct the coned differential E-function \u03b1\u030c = (\u03b1, k, \u03b7E ) on E.\nThe function \u03b1 : CE \u2192 E6 is the topological transgressing 'E-cochain' in Theorem 4.12. We\ntake k = 0, but discuss other possibilities following the proof. Our main task is to construct a\ntransgressing form \u03b7E \u2208 \u03a95 (E).\n17 In the language of [HS] the condition on the curvature is captured by a filtration on the space of differential\nfunctions: filt0 (E; \u03b9)M is a category whose set of isomorphism classes \u03c00 filt0 (E; \u03b9)M is \u011a n (M ).\n18 A based map CX \u2192 E\nn+1 is by adjunction a map X \u2192 P En+1 to the space of paths beginning at the\nbasepoint of En+1 .\n\n28\n\n\fRecall first the Chern-Simons [CS] transgressing form in the universal bundle G \u2192 EG \u2192 BG.\nDenote by h*, *, *i the symmetric trilinear form (3.3) on g = Lie(G). Let \u0398 = \u0398univ \u2208 \u03a91EG (g) be the\nuniversal connection on EG and \u03a9 \u2208 \u03a92EG (g) its curvature. In this notation the 6-form in (1.14),\nlifted to EG, is\n\u03c0 \u2217 \u03c9\u03bc\u030c = h\u03a9 \u2227 \u03a9 \u2227 \u03a9i.\nThen the Chern-Simons 5-form\n(5.15)\n\n1\n1\n\u03b7 = h\u0398 \u2227 \u03a9 \u2227 \u03a9i \u2212 h\u0398 \u2227 \u03a9 \u2227 [\u0398 \u2227 \u0398]i + h\u0398 \u2227 [\u0398 \u2227 \u0398] \u2227 [\u0398 \u2227 \u0398]i\n4\n40\n\nsatisfies the transgression conditions\n(i) the restriction of \u03b7 to a fiber equals \u03c9\u03bd\u030c ; and\n(ii) d\u03b7 = \u03c0 \u2217 \u03c9\u03bc\u030c .\nIn other words, \u03b7 is a transgressing 5-form for the curvatures in Proposition 5.7.\n\u03c0\nWe want now to construct a transgressing 5-form \u03b7E in the fiber bundle E \u2212\n\u2192 BG\u00d7BG with fiber\n(G \u00d7 G)/G \u223c\n= G. Recall that E = (EG \u00d7 EG)/G. We write the pullback of \u03b7E to EG \u00d7 EG, and\nexpress it in terms of the universal connection forms \u03981 , \u03982 and universal curvature forms \u03a91 , \u03a92\non EG \u00d7 EG, but where these forms are regarded as g-valued by identifying g1 \u223c\n= g2 \u223c\n= g. Write \u03b71\nfor (5.15) with \u03981 , \u03a91 replacing \u0398, \u03a9 and similarly for \u03b72 . Then\n(5.16)\n\n\u03b7E = \u03b71 \u2212 \u03b72 + d\u03c4,\n\nwhere\n\u03c4=\n\n1\n1\n1\nh\u03981 \u2227 \u03982 \u2227 [\u03981 \u2227 \u03981 ]i + h\u03981 \u2227 \u03982 \u2227 [\u03982 \u2227 \u03982 ]i \u2212 h\u03981 \u2227 \u03982 \u2227 [\u03981 \u2227 \u03982 ]i\n4\n4\n4\n\u2212 h\u03981 \u2227 \u03982 \u2227 \u03a91 i \u2212 h\u03981 \u2227 \u03982 \u2227 \u03a92 i.\n\nThe form \u03b7E satisfies\n(i) \u03b7E is basic for the diagonal G-action on EG \u00d7 EG;\n(ii) the restriction of \u03b7E to a fiber of \u03c0 : E \u2192 BG \u00d7 BG is cohomologous to \u03c9\u03bd\u030c ; and\n(iii) d\u03b7E = \u03c0 \u2217 (\u03c9\u03bc\u030c1 \u2212 \u03c9\u03bc\u030c2 ).\nWe leave the reader the exhausting task of checking these properties. It helps to observe that the\npullback of \u03c9\u03bd\u030c under the diffeomorphism \u03c7 : (G \u00d7 G)/G \u2192 G in (5.9) is the restriction of \u03b7E to a\nfiber.\n29\n\n\fThe choice of k = 0 in \u03b1\u030c = (\u03b1, k, \u03b7E ) fixes the differential function representing \u03bc\u030c1 \u2212 \u03bc\u030c2 to be the\n\u000e\ntriple \u03b2\u030c = (\u03b1 E , E \u2212 \u03b1\u2217 \u03b96 Z[0,1] , \u03c9\u03bc\u030c1 \u2212 \u03c9\u03bc\u030c2 ); see (5.13). Any other choice of k \u2208 C 4 (E; R) such\n\nthat \u03b1\u030c trivializes \u03b2\u030c must satisfy \u03b4k = 0, so determines a class [k] \u2208 H 4 (E; R). Since equivalence\nclasses of trivializations of \u03b2\u030c is a torsor for \u011a 5 (E)-see the remark following (5.14)-only its image\nin H 4 (E; R/Z) is relevant. In other words, equivalence classes of possible \u03b1\u030c are parametrized by\nelements of H 4 (E; R/Z) \u223c\n= H 4 (BG; R/Z) \u223c\n= R/Z. Write [k] = \u03b8 c2 , where c2 \u2208 H 4 (BG) is the\nNc\n\ngenerator and \u03b8 \u2208 R is determined modulo Nc Z. Recall from the end of \u00a74 that the (G \u00d7 G)-bundle\nQ \u2192 X in (4.15) has a reduction to a G-bundle Q \u2192 X. Then a nonzero cohomology class [k]\nmultiplies the WZW factor (4.15) by\n\u0012\n\u0013\nZ\nc2 (Q) .\nexp 2\u03c0i \u03b8\nX\n\nThis matches the topological term (3.9) in gauged QCD with \u03b8 = \u03b81 + \u03b82 .\nfX in Definition 4.14\nTo conclude we sketch an argument proving that the gauged WZW factor W\nis well-defined. It is a function of a quartet q = (Q, \u0398, \u03b3, \u03c6) which is an object in a groupoid G.\nfX is meant to be a section of the line\nMore precisely, there is a hermitian line bundle L \u2192 G and W\n\nbundle. This means that there is a complex line Lq attached to each object q, a linear isomorphism\n\u01eb : Lq \u2192 Lq\u2032 attached to each morphism q \u2192 q \u2032 , and\n(5.17)\n\n\u0001\nfX (q) = W\nfX (q \u2032 ).\n\u01eb W\n\nIt is this last point which we must check. First, we recall that there is a groupoid G2 whose objects\nare triples (Q, \u0398, \u03b3) of a principal (G \u00d7 G)-bundle Q \u2192 X, a connection \u0398, and a classifying map\n\u03b3 : Q \u2192 E(G\u00d7G) for the connection. A morphism (Q, \u0398, \u03b3) \u2192 (Q\u2032 , \u0398\u2032 , \u03b3 \u2032 ) is an equivalence class of\nquintuples (P, \u039b, \u0393, \u03c60 , \u03c61 ) consisting of a (G\u00d7G)-bundle P \u2192 [0, 1]\u00d7X; a connection \u039b on P whose\ncurvature \u03a9 satisfies \u03b9(\u2202/\u2202t)\u03a9 = 0, where t is the coordinate on [0, 1]; a classifying map \u0393 : P \u2192\nE(G \u00d7 G) for the connection \u039b; an isomorphism \u03c60 of (Q, \u0398, \u03b3) with the restriction of (P, \u039b, \u0393)\nto {0} \u00d7 X; and an isomorphism \u03c61 of (Q\u2032 , \u0398\u2032 , \u03b3 \u2032 ) with the restriction of (P, \u039b, \u0393) to {1} \u00d7 X.\nQuintuples (P, \u039b, \u0393, \u03c60 , \u03c61 ) and (P \u2032 , \u039b\u2032 , \u0393\u2032 , \u03c6\u20320 , \u03c6\u20321 ) are identified if there is an isomorphism P \u2192 P \u2032\nwhich preserves the connections and isomorphisms \u03c6i , \u03c6\u2032i and under which \u0393 and \u0393\u2032 are homotopic.\nAn object (Q, \u0398, \u03b3, \u03c6) in the groupoid G includes the section \u03c6 of the associated bundle GQ \u2192 X,\nand likewise a morphism (P, \u039b, \u0393, \u03a6, \u03c60 , \u03c61 ) includes a section \u03a6 of GP \u2192 [0, 1] \u00d7 X which satisfies\n\u2207\u2202/\u2202t \u03a6 = 0, i.e., \u03a6 is flat along trajectories of \u2202/\u2202t.
