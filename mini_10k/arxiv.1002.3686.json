Kastner describes a thought experiment which is claimed\nto show interference with hundred percent visibility and also an \"apparent\"\nwhich-slit information.

Opening only slit A results in only detector DA clicking,\nand opening only slit B leads to only DB clicking. Afshar argues that the\ndetectors DA and DB yield information about which slit, A or B, the particle\ninitially passed through. If one places a screen before the lens, the interference\npattern is visible.\nConventionally, if one tries to observe the interference pattern, one cannot\nget the which-way information. Afshar has a clever scheme for establishing\nthe existence of the interference pattern without actually observing it. First\nthe exact location of the dark fringes are noted by observing the interference pattern. Then, thin wires are placed in the exact locations of the dark\nfringes. The argument is that if the interference pattern exists, sliding in\nwires through the dark fringes will not affect the intensity of light on the two\nDepartment of Physics, Jamia Millia Islamia\nNew Delhi-110025, India.\nE-mail: tabish.ph@jmi.ac.in\n\n\f2\n\ndetectors. If the interference pattern is not there, some photons are bound\nto hit the wires, and get scattered, thus reducing the photon count at the\ntwo detectors. This way, the existence of the interference pattern can be established without actually disturbing the photons in any way. Afshar et al\ncarried out the experiment and found that sliding in wires in the expected\nlocations of the dark fringes, doesn't lead to any significant reduction of intensity at the detectors. Hence they claim that they have demonstrated a\nviolation of complementarity.\nRecently, Kastner has addressed the issue of interference visibility in the\nAfshar experiment [2]. Kastner believes that the essence of the Afshar experiment is captured by a thought experiment discussed by Srikanth [3] in\nthe context of complementarity. Kastner analyzed this two-slit experiment\nin which there is an additional internal degree of freedom of the detector\nelements (which can be considered a vibrational component). The particle +\ndetector state evolves from the slits to the final screen with initial detector\nstate |0i. The detector spatial basis states |\u03c6x i and vibrational basis states\n|vU i and |vL i (corresponding to the particle passing through the upper and\nlower slit, respectively) are activated. This evolution, from the initial state\nto the detected particle, is given by\nX\n1\n\u221a (|U i + |Li)|0i \u2192\n|xi {ax |\u03c6x i|vU i + bx |\u03c6x i|vL i} ,\n2\nx\n\n(1)\n\nwhere amplitudes ax and bx depend on wave number, distance, and slit of\norigin, and |xi are final particle basis states. Upon detection at a particular\nlocation x, one term remains from the sum on the right-hand side of (1):\n|xi {ax |\u03c6x i|vU i + bx |\u03c6x i|vL i} .\n\n(2)\n\nKastner argues that the result of this experiment is even more dramatic\nthan that of the Afshar experiment, because visibility is hundred percent\nsince a fully articulated interference pattern has been irreversibly recorded\n- not just indicated indirectly - and yet a measurement can be performed\nlater, that seems to reveal which slit the photon went through.\nHowever, this argument is not correct, as can be seen from the following.\nSuppose there were no \"vibrational states\", then the term which remains\nfrom the sum in (1) would be given by\n|xi {ax |\u03c6x i + bx |\u03c6x i} .\n\n(3)\n\nThe probability density of detecting the particle at position x is then given\nby\n\b\n(4)\nP (x) = |ax |2 + |bx |2 + a\u2217x bx + ax b\u2217x h\u03c6x |\u03c6x i,\nwhere the last two terms in the curly brackets denote interference.\nOne the other hand, the probability density of detecting the particle at\nposition x, in the presence of \"vibrational states\" is given by\nP (x) = {|ax |2 hvU |vU i + |bx |2 hvL |vL i + a\u2217x bx hvU |vL i + ax b\u2217x hvL |vU i}h\u03c6x |\u03c6x i\n\b\n(5)\n= |ax |2 + |bx |2 h\u03c6x |\u03c6x i,\n\n\f3\n\nwhere the interference terms are killed by the orthogonality of |vU i and |vL i.\nSo, contrary to the claim in [2], this experiment does not show any interference, although the \"vibrational states\" do provide which-way information.\nThis is in perfect agreement with Bohr's complementarity principle. It can\nshow interference if |vU i and |vL i are not strictly orthogonal. However, in\nthat case one cannot extract any which-way information.\nIn conlcusion, we have shown that the thought experiment, described by\nKastner, does not show interference at all. What the experiment does show is\nthat if there exists which-way information in the state, there is no interference\npattern on the screen, in agreement with Bohr's complementarity principle.\nReferences\n1.
