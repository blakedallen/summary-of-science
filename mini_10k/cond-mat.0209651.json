For precisely this reason, the majority\nof ARPES data on the high Tc 's to date have come from\nBi2212. Unfortunately, high quality Bi2212 crystals at\nvery low dopings have not been achieved. On the other\nhand, A2 CuO2 Cl2 (A=Sr,Ca) also cleaves extremely well\nand gives high quality ARPES data comparable to that\nseen in optimally doped Bi2212, but in this case, single\ncrystals have only been available at half filling. As a\nresult, there exists no perfect system to study the electronic structure from the antiferromagnetic insulator to\nthe heavily over doped metal in the hole doped cuprates.\nThe solution has been to make the reasonable assumption that the low energy physics of the Bi2212 and\nA2 CuO2 Cl2 (ACOC) systems are identical due to the fact\nthat the CuO2 planes are common to both structures.\nThus the entire doping range can be studied. However, these two systems also have several differences.\nSr2 CuO2 Cl2 (SCOC) and Ca2 CuO2 Cl2 (CCOC) have a\nCu-O-Cu distance of 3.97\u00c5 and 3.87\u00c5 respectively,6 compared to 3.83\u00c5 for Bi2212,7 and they also do not possess\nthe orthorhombic distortion and superstructure effects\nwhich plague Bi2212. Finally, the most striking difference in ACOC is that the apical oxygen has been replaced\nwith a chlorine atom. It is important to test whether or\n\nI. INTRODUCTION\n\nOne approach to unraveling the mysteries of the high\nTc superconductors is to understand how the electronic\nstructure evolves from an antiferromagnetic insulator to\na superconductor upon doping. The first step is then to\nunderstand the insulator to metal transition. Although\nMott qualitatively described how a material, predicted by\nband theory to be a metal, would in fact be an insulator,1\nit remains unclear as to how the details of the electronic\nstructure evolve from a half-filled metal to a Mott insulator. Questions such as how does the gap open, and what\nhappens to the information contained in the occupation\nprobability n(k) when strong correlations drive the system insulating need to be answered. The technique of angle resolved photoemission (ARPES) is a natural choice\nto do this.\nOf course, with every well posed question, there are\nexperimental challenges which make it difficult to answer these questions. La2\u2212x Srx CuO4 (LSCO) is one\nsystem which has been successfully grown from half\nfilling to heavily overdoped; however, ARPES results\non these crystals remain somewhat uncertain as illustrated by the extremely broad spectra of La2 CuO4 .2\nNd2\u2212x Cex CuO4 (NCCO) is another system which spans\na similar doping range, and has attempted to answer\nthe above questions;3,4 however, it is not clear whether\nthe results can be generalized to include the hole doped\ncuprates. YBa2 Cu3 O6+\u03b4 (YBCO), which can cover the\n\n1\n\n\fform. A linear dispersion at the node of the form\nE(\u03c0/2, \u03c0/2) \u2212 E(k) \u221d ||k \u2212 (\u03c0/2, \u03c0/2)|| is highly nontrivial and several theories which attempt to connect the\ninsulator to the superconductor predict precisely such a\ndiscontinuity in the derivative of the dispersion at the\nnode13,15,16 . However, the t-J model with next nearest neighbor hopping terms t\u2032 and t\u2032\u2032 , which correctly\ndescribes gross features of the dispersion, has a functional form of cos2kx a + cos2ky a which is analytic at\nkx =ky . To investigate this issue we performed ultra high\nresolution ARPES experiments along the antiferromagnetic Brillouin zone(AFBZ) to determine the exact nature of the dispersion near kx =ky . From this data we\nfind that the dispersion near the node is non-linear and\nthus can not be fit by the simple d-wave functional form\nof |coskx a \u2212 cosky a|.\nThe paper is organized as follows. Section II presents\nthe experimental details. Sections III through VI present\nphotoemission results from the various insulating parent\ncuprates illustrating that the low energy spectra is independent of the apical site. Section VII is a photon energy\ndependent investigation of CCOC. Section VIII compares\nthe dispersion of CCOC with the pure d-wave functional\nform. Section IX discusses the experimental results with\nregards to current theoretical understanding after which\nwe conclude.\n\nnot these differences can have an effect on the low energy\nelectronic structure.\nIn this paper we will validate the assumption that low\nenergy ARPES data on the oxyhalides are indeed representative of photoemission from a generic, half-filled\nCuO2 plane, and thus may be reasonably compared with\nARPES data on hole doped Bi2212. This will be done\nby showing that replacing the apical chlorine with the\nlarger, and less electronegative bromine has no effect on\nthe low energy electronic structure. Furthermore, it will\nalso be shown that heavily underdoped Bi2212 near half\nfilling, despite having relatively poor spectral quality,\nis qualitatively consistent with the results on the oxyhalides. Finally, ARPES on Sr2 Cu3 O4 Cl2 , which contains an additional copper atom in every other CuO2\nplaquette, demonstrates that the lowest lying excitations\nattributed to a Zhang-Rice singlet8 is surprisingly unaffected by even a seemingly large modification of the\nCuO2 plane.\nHaving shown that the ARPES results of the half filled\nMott insulating cuprate are not system dependent, we\nwill turn our attention in the latter half to extracting\nthe physics of the half filled CuO2 plane contained in\nthe single particle spectral function, A(k, \u03c9). Because\nmatrix elements modulate the measured photoemission\nintensity, it is important to distinguish which features of\nthe data are intrinsic and which are extrinsic. However,\nphoton energy (E\u03b3 ) dependent studies designed specifically to test the influence of the matrix element on both\nthe dispersion E(k),9,10 and the intensity n(k),11 have\nhad conflicting reports on the magnitude of variations\ncaused by matrix elements. So to test whether or not the\ndispersion and the k dependence of the spectral weight\nare impressive manifestations of matrix element modulations, we have performed ARPES n(k) mappings over the\nentire Brillouin zone for 5 different photon energies, and\nexamined the (0,0) to (\u03c0, \u03c0) cut for 13 photon energies.\nWe find that the dispersion is independent of photon energy as one might expect, and that with few exceptions,\nthe remnant Fermi surface12 is robust despite observing\nstrong variations in spectral weight caused by matrix elements.\nWith an understanding of the matrix element we can\nfinally turn our attention to the physics. Specifically,\nwe will focus on the d-wave-like dispersion found in the\ninsulator.12 This observation allows for a natural connection between the d-wave form of the high energy pseudogap seen in underdoped Bi2212 and the dispersion of\nthe insulator as first suggested by Laughlin.13 This connection is particularly intriguing in light of the fact that\nthe high energy pseudogap and low energy pseudogap\nappear to be correlated.14 The latter of which is directly\nrelated to the superconducting gap, thus linking antiferromagnetism which is responsible for the dispersion of\nthe insulator to d-wave superconductivity.\nThe original ARPES dispersion data on CCOC left\nsome ambiguity as to whether or not the detailed dispersion near the node exactly fit the d-wave functional\n\nII. EXPERIMENTAL\n\nA2 CuO2 X2 (A=Sr, Ca; X=Cl, Br), Sr2 Cu3 O4 Cl2 , and\nBi2 Sr2 MCu2 O8 (M=Er, Dy) single crystals were grown\nby a slow cool flux method.17,18 ARPES experiments\nwere performed at beamlines V-3 and V-4 of the Stanford\nSynchrotron Radiation Laboratory. The beamline V-4\nsystem is capable of achieving an energy and angular resolution better than 15meV and 0.25\u25e6 . However, for the\nmajority of this work such high resolution is not necessary due to the extremely broad features which are being\nstudied. Thus, the high resolution is only occasionally\nutilized while the remaining data presented uses a resolution of \u226470meV and \u00b11\u25e6 . Crystals were oriented prior\nto the experiment by Laue back reflection, and cleaved in\nsitu at a base pressure better than 5 \u00d7 10\u221211 torr. The\nphoton flux was varied to determine whether or not the\ninsulating sample was charging. If it was then the sample\ntemperature was raised when possible to eliminate this\neffect. A lineshape which is independent of the photon\nflux is taken as proof that there is no charging despite the\nfact that the samples are insulators. Slight charging is\nobserved for the Ca2 CuO2 Br2 and Sr2 Cu3 O4 Cl2 samples\nat room temperature, but the results were reproducible\nand the spectra simply shifted to higher binding energy\nwith increased flux indicating a uniform potential barrier\nformed due to charging.\nWe also note that the minimum binding energy of an\ninsulator can vary up to 1eV from cleave to cleave even\n\n2\n\n\fin the absence of any charging. The reason for this is\nnot known with certainty, but is likely due to different\npinning sites for different cleaves. For the oxychlorides\nwe typically find the centroid of the minimum binding\nenergy feature to lie between 0.5 and 0.8eV below the\nchemical potential which is determined by the EF of a\nreference gold sample in electrical contact.\nIII. Sr2 CuO2 Cl2 AND Ca2 CuO2 Cl2\n\nFigure 1 presents a comparison between SCOC and\nCCOC along the high symmetry directions. The two are\nnearly identical. This is to be expected as Sr and Ca are\nisovalent and lie between the CuO2 planes. From (0,0)\nto (\u03c0, \u03c0) they show a feature which emerges from the\nbackground, disperses towards the chemical potential,\nreaches a maximum at (\u03c0/2, \u03c0/2) and then loses weight\nrapidly as it pushes back to higher binding energy.19 We\nnote that the centroid of the lowest energy excitation at\n(\u03c0/2, \u03c0/2) still lies well below the chemical potential (off\nscale), indicative of the fact that these crystals are Mott\ninsulators. Along the (0,0) to (\u03c0, 0) cut a more intense\nand significantly more asymmetric peak is observed. Under certain experimental conditions it becomes clear that\nthis strong asymmetry is due to the presence of a second feature which lies approximately 600meV below the\nmain band.20 The dispersion of this second feature appears similar to that of the lower binding energy feature, although the intensity is not. The feature along the\n(\u03c0, 0) cut does not show much dispersion, and lies approximately 350meV below the maximum in dispersion\nat (\u03c0/2, \u03c0/2). In spectra where the peak positions are\nnot as clear we will attempt to make a quantitative comparison by taking the minimum of the second derivative\nof the spectra. We do not present any detailed fits of\nthe spectra due to a lack of theoretical understanding of\nthe broad spectral lineshapes inherent to the half-filled\ncuprates. We note that the broad spectral lineshapes of\nthe half-filled cuprates are an intrinsic properties of the\nspectra, and not a result of the sample charging. As\nstated above, this is confirmed in ACOC by varying the\nphoton flux and observing no change in the spectra.\nThe one significant difference between SCOC and\nCCOC is the observed spectral weight at (\u03c0, 0) in CCOC\nwhich is suppressed in SCOC. On going from (\u03c0, 0) to\n(\u03c0, \u03c0) it can be seen that this weight vanishes quickly.\nAlthough it is not clear why the matrix elements would\nfavor CCOC over SCOC in the (\u03c0, 0) region, it is this\ndifference which facilitated the identification of a remnant Fermi surface in CCOC which was not observed in\nprevious studies on SCOC12 .\nOne of the most significant features of the insulator is\nthe dispersion between (\u03c0/2, \u03c0/2) and (\u03c0, 0). There are\ntwo aspects to notice in the right most panels of figure 1.\nThe most important is clearly the difference of roughly\n350meV in dispersion. This is the magnitude of the d-\n\nFIG. 1. EDCs of Sr2 CuO2 Cl2 (a) and Ca2 CuO2 Cl2 (b)\nalong the high symmetry direction indicated in the insets.\nThe final panel indicates the magnitude of the d-wave-like\ndispersion seen in the oxyhalides, and the difference in lineshape exhibited as a function of k. The measurement conditions were T=150K, E\u03b3 =22.4eV and T=100K, E\u03b3 =25.2eV\nfor Sr2 CuO2 Cl2 and Ca2 CuO2 Cl2 , respectively.\n\nwave-like modulation seen in the insulator. The second is\nthe strong difference in lineshape. At (\u03c0/2, \u03c0/2) the spectra show a clear peak which resembles a quasiparticle like\npeak, albeit with a very large width(\u223c300meV), while at\n(\u03c0, 0), the spectra merges more continuously into the high\nenergy background, somewhat resembling a step function. These will be the benchmarks to which the other\ncompounds will be compared in determining whether or\nnot the data from SCOC and CCOC are representative\nof a single half-filled CuO2 plane.\nIV. Ca2 CuO2 Br2\n\nThe biggest difference between ACOC and other high\nTc cuprates is the presence of chlorine as opposed to\noxygen in the apical site. To see whether or not the\napical site has an effect on the electronic structure we\npresent in figure 2 ARPES data from Ca2 CuO2 Br2 where\nbromine has replaced chlorine in the apical site. From\nband theory calculations the binding energy of the apical\norbital is -3.4eV, -2.8eV, and -2.6eV for Ca2 CuO2 Cl2 ,\nCa2 CuO2 Br2 , and La2 CuO4 respectively,21 which suggests that CCOB is a suitable candidate to determine\nthe effect of the apical chlorine as compared with an apical oxygen on the low energy electronic structure.

EDCs of Bi2 Sr2 ErCu2 O8 along the high symmetry\ndirections as indicated in the cartoons. Below is a plot of\nthe second derivative of the above EDCs, from which one can\ntrace out the dispersion. E\u03b3 =22.4eV and T=100K.\n\nand an overall bandwidth of approximately 300 meV. In\npanel (b) the spectra at (\u03c0/2, \u03c0/2) and (\u03c0, 0) are compared. These data look almost identical to those from\nCCOC which are shown in figure 1. Specifically, the\nlineshape at (\u03c0/2, \u03c0/2) is quite sharp and well defined\ncompared with the broad feature seen at (\u03c0, 0). The energy difference of 270 meV (determined by the minimum\nof the second derivative of the corresponding spectra) is\nalso consistent with that seen in CCOC. We also took\na limited amount of data on Sr2 CuO2 Br2 (not shown).\nThe general features of Sr2 CuO2 Br2 were consistent with\nthat of the other oxyhalides, although significant charging was observed. The data on the oxybromides suggests\nthat the low energy excitations are relatively independent\nof the apical atoms and the observed spectral function in\nACOC thus originates from the half filled CuO2 plane.\nConsequently, the comparison of ARPES data on ACOC\nat half filling with Bi2212 data at finite doping seems\nvalid.\n\ncome smeared out as one proceeds toward half filling in\nthis system.22 ,23 This is precisely the reason why ARPES\ndata on the oxychlorides has been so valuable to understanding the problem of a single hole in an antiferromagnet. The reason for the relatively poor spectral quality of\nheavily underdoped Bi2212 is an open question, although\nit is possibly simply an issue of sample quality, such as\nlattice strain.\nExamining the low energy spectra from (0,0) to (\u03c0, \u03c0)\nof Er doped Bi2212 we see that the shoulder is most\npronounced at (\u03c0/2, \u03c0/2) with a minimum binding energy of -0.27 eV. From (0,0) to (\u03c0, 0) the shoulder develops at higher binding energy with a value of -0.49 eV\nat (\u03c0, 0) and then disappears again as one travels from\n(\u03c0, 0) to (\u03c0, \u03c0). Although there is significant ambiguity\nin identifying the binding energy of these features, the\nfact that the shoulder has a dispersion of roughly 0.22eV\nbetween (\u03c0, 0) and (\u03c0/2, \u03c0/2) can be clearly seen in the\nfinal panel. The second derivative of the spectra from\nwhich the above values are attained are also presented\nin figure 3. One can see that the dispersion found with\nthis method reproduces the above description. Results\non Dy doped Bi2212 shown in figure 4 clearly mimic the\nbehavior seen in the Er doped Bi2212 including the 0.22\neV difference in energy between (\u03c0/2, \u03c0/2) and (\u03c0, 0).\nThe overall features of the dispersion and the resulting\nenergy difference of roughly 220 meV between (\u03c0/2, \u03c0/2)\nand (\u03c0, 0) in Er and Dy doped Bi2212 is qualitatively\nconsistent with the dispersion and the 350 meV d-wavelike modulation seen in CCOC. We suspect the quantitative difference between Bi2212 and ACOC may simply\nbe due to the poor definition of spectral features of the\nformer, but we can not rule out the possibility that it is\nan intrinsic difference between the two samples. Never-\n\nV. Bi2 Sr2 ErCu2 O8 AND Bi2 Sr2 DyCu2 O8\n\nOf course, as mentioned previously, the ideal scenario\nto examine the doping evolution is to study the same system through the entire doping range. Therefore, we also\npresent Er and Dy doped Bi2212 crystals grown near\nhalf filling. Figures 3 and 4 show the EDCs for these\nsamples along the high symmetry directions. The low\nenergy features are not nearly as well defined as in the\noxyhalides; however, a clear shoulder does emerge from\nthe background. The poor definition of these features is\nconsistent with previous studies on underdoped Bi2212\nwhich show that the low energy excitation spectra be-\n\n4\n\n\fFIG. 5.

The dashes lines in the right panel mark the positions\nof maximum curvature.\n\nvation is consistent with the state having a dx2 \u2212y2 orbital\ncharacter.\nIn figure 7, two perpendicular cuts through (\u03c0/2, \u03c0/2)\nare shown. Note that the lowest energy feature is most\nwell defined near (\u03c0/2, \u03c0/2), the dispersion is isotropic\nabout its maximum at (\u03c0/2, \u03c0/2), and as can be seen in\nthe final panel, (\u03c0, 0) lies approximately 320 meV below\n(\u03c0/2, \u03c0/2), although significant uncertainty exists in the\npeak position. These results, including the polarization\ndependence, are identical to the case of ACOC.10 They\nare also consistent with earlier reports on the isostructural compound Ba2 Cu3 O4 Cl2 taken at a higher photon\nenergy.24,25 We confirm the observation that the spectral\nfeatures about (\u03c0/2, \u03c0/2) have a remarkable resemblance\nto those in Sr2 CuO2 Cl2 . It is astounding that the properties of the Zhang-Rice singlet seen in ACOC are almost\nundisturbed by the drastic change to the CuO2 lattice in\nthe case of Sr2 Cu3 O4 Cl2 .\n\ntheless, even with the poor spectral definition in heavily\nunderdoped Bi2212, the electronic structure is still qualitatively consistent between the oxyhalide and Bi2212 systems. This result along with our data on CCOB, justifies\nthe long standing assumption that the ARPES data from\nSCOC and CCOC are representative of a half filled CuO2\nsquare lattice.\nVI. Sr2 Cu3 O4 Cl2 : Cu3 O4 PLANE\n\nSr2 Cu3 O4 Cl2 is a particularly remarkable example of\nthe apparent robustness of the structure of the lowest\nenergy excitations. This system deviates from the other\ncuprates due to an additional Cu atom located in every\nother CuO2 plaquette resulting in an in-plane stoichiometry of Cu3 O4 . The resulting crystal structure has a unit\ncell twice as large as in Sr2 CuO2 Cl2 and rotated by 45\ndegrees (see figure 5). Thus (\u03c0, 0) of the CuO2 unit cell is\nnow equivalent to (\u03c0, \u03c0) in the Cu3 O4 system, and similarly (\u03c0/2, \u03c0/2) for Sr2 CuO2 Cl2 is equivalent to (\u03c0, 0)\nfor Sr2 Cu3 O4 Cl2 . However, instead of presenting results\nin the new Cu3 O4 basis, we will continue to present all\nmomentum values in the original CuO2 basis. This will\nmake for a simpler comparison between the two systems.\nA sample valence band spectra of Sr2 Cu3 O4 Cl2 at\n(\u03c0/2, \u03c0/2) is shown in figure 6. In fact it is very similar to the valence band of Sr2 CuO2 Cl2 at (\u03c0/2, \u03c0/2).10\nWe will however, continue to focus on the \"foot\" of\nthe valence band which contains the low energy excitations. The following panel examines the low energy excitation spectra at two equivalent points: (+\u03c0/2, +\u03c0/2)\nand (+\u03c0/2, \u2212\u03c0/2). Since the polarization of the incident\nlight is horizontal, the suppression of spectral weight at\n(+\u03c0/2, \u2212\u03c0/2) relative to (+\u03c0/2, +\u03c0/2) indicates that the\nwave function at (\u03c0/2, \u03c0/2) is odd with respect to a mirror plane at 45\u25e6 to the Cu-O bond direction.

The peak positions were\nfound by taking the minimum of the second derivative of\neach spectra. One can see that to within our experimental limits, which were determined by the reproducibility of the dispersion on subsequent scans under identical\nconditions and is given by the width of the blue bar, the\ndispersion is independent of photon energy. This agrees\nwith most of the previous reports on SCOC19,20,26 , including one very detailed, recent study10 , but contrast\nwith the results from Refs.11,27 , the former of which report that the minimum binding energy position shifts\nby approximately 10% of the (0,0) to (\u03c0, \u03c0) distance to\n(0.39\u03c0, 0.39\u03c0) when using 35eV photons. (note that this\nis outside of our momenta error bars) They attribute\nthis change to matrix elements where the dependence on\nbinding energy varies as a function of photon energy.\nAside from indicating the expected two dimensional\nnature of the dispersion, our photon energy dependence\nhas also clearly resolved the presence of a second component in the low energy electronic structure of the\nhalf filled insulator.20 Figure 10 presents EDCs in the\nnodal direction for six photon energies from 16.5eV to\n17.5eV. Aside from the feature typically associated with\nthe Zhang-Rice singlet, a second component is observed\nat approximately 600meV higher binding energy. In the\nnodal direction this feature is most clearly resolved at\n17eV. From this data it is clear that when attempting\nto model the data on the insulator, one can not simply treat the high energy spectral weight as a featureless\nbackground. Although the dispersion of this feature is\ndifficult to track it appears to mimic the dispersion of\nthe lowest energy feature. The strong influence of matrix\nelements and a lack of understanding of the origin of the\nspectral lineshapes prevents us from extracting detailed\ninformation on this high energy feature and its evolution\nwith photon energy. One possible origin of this feature is\nfrom string resonances.28 String resonances occur when\na hole, created in an antiferromagnetic background, experiences a confining potential due to the energy cost\nassociated with disrupting the antiferromagnetic order\nas it hops away from its original location. The lowest\nenergy state for the hole in this potential corresponds\nto the Zhang-Rice singlet, while the first excited state\nis predicted to lie roughly 1.8(J/t)2/3 \u2248 0.5eV higher in\nenergy.29 Although we are not certain of the origin of\nthe higher energy feature, the string resonance concept\nprovides an intriguing possibility for further study.\nHaving examined the dispersion, we now look at the\nmore difficult problem of extracting the underlying n(k)\nstructure. It is of particular interest to determine\nwhether or not the underlying intensity profile of A(k, \u03c9)\nhas an asymmetry with respect to the antiferromagnetic\nzone boundary as this would put constraints on the valid\ncoupling regime for different models.28,30 For the majority of data shown in figure 8 we noticed that the inten-\n\nFIG. 7. a) and b) EDCs of Sr2 Cu3 O4 Cl2 along two high\nsymmetry directions as indicated in the inset. c) Comparison of the spectra at (\u03c0/2, \u03c0/2) and (\u03c0, 0). E\u03b3 =16.5eV and\nT=293K.\nVII. E\u03b3 DEPENDENCE ON E(k) AND n(k)\n\nHaving shown that the low energy spectra of a halffilled CuO2 plane are independent of the material system\nbeing studied, we next attempt to separate the features\nof the data which are representative of the single particle spectral function, A(k, \u03c9), from those which are a\nresult of the matrix elements. Unfortunately, extracting\nthe single particle spectral function from ARPES measurements is difficult due to the fact that the measured\nphotoemission intensity under the sudden approximation\nis a product of the occupied single particle spectral function and the matrix element. In interacting electron systems, it is impossible to calculate the matrix elements\nexactly, thus further complicating the ARPES analysis.\nAlthough we note that symmetry arguments can be very\npowerful in understanding some properties of the matrix\nelement,10 in general it is a function of the experimental\ngeometry, photon energy, and the electronic wave function. Since its details are not well understood, the objective in a given photoemission study must be to focus on\nonly those features of the data which are robust against\nvariations in the experimental conditions.\nHere we present a photon energy dependence study to\nextract the intrinsic E(k) and n(k) structure from the\nraw ARPES data which is modulated by the matrix element. On a single cleave we measured EDCs along the\nnodal direction for 13 different photon energies from 14.5\nto 33eV which are shown in figure 8. The morphology\nof the spectra are similar to one another. There are two\naspects we wish to address. First, the minimum binding\nenergy occurs near (\u03c0/2, \u03c0/2) for all the photon energies\nstudied, and second, with a few exceptions, the intensity\nprofile begins to lose weight before the minimum in binding energy is reached (photon energies of 16.5, 32, and\n33eV are the exceptions where the intensity is symmetric\nabout (\u03c0/2, \u03c0/2)). We will address the latter point in\n\n6\n\n\fFIG. 8. EDCs from a single cleave of CCOC along \u0393 \u2192 (\u03c0, \u03c0) for 13 different photon energies indicated in each panel\nrespectively.

T=200K.\n\n0.00\n\n(a)\n\nsity of the lowest energy excitation begins to lose weight\nbefore (\u03c0/2, \u03c0/2). By examining the image plot of a representative set of spectra (as done in figure 11) this effect can be seen to be quite dramatic. This has also\nbeen observed previously by several authors with isolated\nphoton energies.9,19,20,26,27 In figure 9b the n(k) curves\nobtained by integrating the EDCs from -0.5 to 0.3eV relative to the valence band maximum for each photon energy are shown. In presenting n(k) we implicitly use the\nsudden approximation to extract the momentum distribution function n(k), from ARPES data via the relaR\ntion n(k) = A(~k, \u03c9)f (\u03c9)d\u03c9 where f (\u03c9) is the Fermi\nfunction.31 We note here that the experimental quantity\nmeasured is not precisely n(k), as the photoemission intensity is weighted by the matrix element and the integration window is limited due to the presence of additional\nbands. The energy integration window was chosen so as\nto minimize the contribution from the second component\nseen at higher binding energy, but we note that the re-\n\n(b)\n\n-0.10\n\nRelative n(k)\n\nRelative E(k) (eV)\n\n-0.05\n\n-0.15\n14.5\n16.5\n18.5\n19.5\n20.5\n21.5\n22.5\n\n-0.20\n\n-0.25\n\n-0.30\n0.35\n\n0.40\n\n0.45\n\n0.50\n\n23.5\n24.5\n25.5\n26.5\n32\n33\n\n0.55\n\nkx ( \u03c0/a) (=k y )\n\n0.60\n\n0.65\n\n14.5\n16.5\n18.5\n19.5\n20.5\n21.5\n22.5\n\n0.35\n\n0.40\n\n0.45\n\n23.5\n24.5\n25.5\n26.5\n32\n33\n\n0.50\n\n0.55\n\n0.60\n\n0.65\n\nkx ( \u03c0/a) (=k y )\n\nFIG. 9. a)E(k) obtained along the nodal direction from the\n13 photon energies presented in figure 8.

EDCs from a single cleave of CCOC along the nodal direction for E\u03b3 =16.5eV to E\u03b3 =17.5eV as indicated in each\npanel. The bold spectra indicates (\u03c0/2, \u03c0/2). The angular separation between the top and bottom spectra in each panel is 13\u25e6\nwith an energy resolution, \u2206E = 70meV. T=293K.\n\nsults are qualitatively independent of the specific energy\nwindow chosen.\nClearly, with the exception of 16.5, 32, and 33eV the\nintensity profile peaks well before (\u03c0/2, \u03c0/2), and drops\nrapidly as one crosses the antiferromagnetic zone boundary at (\u03c0/2, \u03c0/2). The fact that 16.5, 32 and 33eV data\ncan differ so dramatically is evidence of what the matrix\nelements can do. If the underlying spectral function were\nsymmetric about (\u03c0/2, \u03c0/2) then one would expect that\nthe distribution of curves in figure 9b would be evenly distributed about (\u03c0/2, \u03c0/2). This is the case for a similar\nstudy on SCOC, which used five photon energies from\n20 to 24eV.11 They observe the intensity profile to be\nmore heavily weighted towards (0,0) at E\u03b3 =24eV which\nthen gradually shifts until at E\u03b3 =20eV the profile is more\nheavily weighted towards (\u03c0, \u03c0). From this they conclude\nthat the true underlying n(k) is symmetric. However, the\ndata in figure 9 from 13 different photon energies suggests\notherwise. 10 curves have an asymmetry more heavily\nweighted towards (0,0), 3 are peaked at (\u03c0/2, \u03c0/2), and\nnone are more heavily weighted towards (\u03c0, \u03c0). Combining figure 9b with the majority of other single photon\nenergy studies on SCOC9,19,20,26,27 suggests to us that a\ntrue asymmetry does exist in the underlying occupation\nprobability, n(k).\n\nFIG. 11. a) EDCs and b) corresponding image plot of\nCCOC taken along the nodal direction with 23.5eV photons.\nThe bold spectra indicates (\u03c0/2, \u03c0/2), and T=200K.\n\n8\n\n\fAs all of the above studies were only from a single\ncut through the Brillouin zone we now examine a more\nglobal perspective of the intensity profile. Figure 12b)-f),\npresents relative n(k) patterns of CCOC over a Brillouin\nzone quadrant for five different photon energies while\npanel a) is of an optimally doped Bi2212 sample. Spectra\nare taken at the crosses, values in between were generated from a linear interpolation, and except for panel (c),\nthe data has been symmeterized about kx =ky and the geometry of the experimental setup was identical for each\ndata set. The in-plane component of the electric field was\npolarized along the Cu-O bond direction (This is a 45\u25e6 rotation relative to the data presented in figures 8 and 10).\nThe first two panels reproduce the original comparison\nof metallic Bi2212 and insulating CCOC from which the\ninitial identification of a \"remnant Fermi surface\" was\nmade.12 For a state with dx2 \u2212y2 orbital symmetry the\nsuppression of weight as one approaches the line kx =0\nis expected. In Bi2212 the only drop in intensity which\nis not naturally explained by matrix elements is where\na Fermi surface crossing has occurred. As seen in the\nfigure the intensity drop matches the traditional method\nfor determining a Fermi surface crossing by following the\ndispersion by eye and is indicated by the dots. This indicates that the surface of steepest descent in the experimentally determined n(k) is a valid method of determining the Fermi surface. The surprise is that a similar drop\nin intensity is observed in the insulator. Although the\nfeature is less well defined here, the striking resemblance\nit bears to the metal suggests that the origin is similar,\nand hence it was qualitatively described as a remnant\nFermi surface.12 [Note that the remnant Fermi surface is\nstill fully gapped by the large Mott gap.]\nHere we examine the effect of changing the photon energy to determine if this feature is robust. From panels\n(b) through (f) one immediately notices that the intensity\npattern varies tremendously for the five photon energies:\n25.2, 16.5, 29, 32.3, and 41eV. However, the variations\nappear predominantly parallel to the (\u03c0, 0) to (0, \u03c0) direction, while perpendicular to this there exists relatively\nlittle variation as we noted above in figure 9. The exact\nshape of the remnant Fermi surface may change, but at\nall photon energies used there is a loss of spectral weight\nas one crosses the approximate antiferromagnetic zone\nboundary from (0, \u03c0) to (\u03c0, 0). It may appear that the\nremnant Fermi surface crosses the (0,0) to (\u03c0, 0) cut or\nthe (\u03c0, 0) to (\u03c0, \u03c0) cut depending on the photon energy\nchosen, but the broadness and the variability due to matrix elements prevent one from clearly identifying the intensity profile as either case.

ROUNDED NODAL DISPERSION\n\nThe greatest utility of the remnant Fermi surface concept as it pertains to the high temperature superconductors is that a d-wave-like dispersion was identified in\nthe insulator, which could thus provide a natural connection to the d-wave-like high energy pseudogap.12 In\nARPES the pseudogap about (\u03c0, 0) is characterized in\ntwo ways. The first is by the use of the leading edge\nmidpoint, which has the same energy scale as the superconducting gap, and is typically defined in the same way,\nonly above Tc . However, another energy scale exists in\nthe spectra which is an order of magnitude larger, and is\nsometimes refered to as a hump or a high energy pseudogap. This is the feature which provides a direct connection with the dispersion observed in the insulator.32 The\nremnant Fermi surface identifies a topological contour in\nthe Brillouin zone of the insulator, which in this case is\nthe antiferromagnetic zone boundary. By examining the\ndispersion along this contour one can identify a \"gap\" in\nthis system, the dispersion of which along the remnant\nFermi surface fits the d-wave functional form remarkably\nwell. We now extend our earlier study on CCOC to examine the precise nature of the dispersion near the nodal\nline kx =ky .12 A simple d-wave dispersion proportional to\n| cos kx a\u2212cos ky a| would produce a linear dispersion with\na discontinuous derivative perpendicular to the nodal direction at kx =ky . This is most easily seen along the antiferromagnetic zone boundary where the above function\nreduces to | sin(kx a \u2212 \u03c0/2)|. Such a non-analytic dispersion is non-trivial, and hence the presence or absence of\nsuch a dispersion is of great significance to theories which\nattempt to unify the antiferromagnetic insulator with the\nd-wave superconductor.\nIn figure 15 we present EDCs taken at 0.6\u25e6 intervals\n\ningly randomly with photon energy. In the extreme case\nbetween 25.2eV and 29eV the intensity is increasing as\none approaches (\u03c0/2, \u03c0/2) for the former, and decreasing\nfor the latter. One might expect such behavior when the\nunderlying spectral function does not possess an asymmetry. Meanwhile the asymmetry in spectral weight perpendicular to the antiferromagnetic zone boundary (see\nfigure 9b) appears robust to the strong variations in the\nmatrix element.\nIn general, the outgoing photoelectrons resulting from\nphotons with different wavelengths will necessarily have\na different overlap with the initial wavefunctions of the\nsystem, and hence different cross-sections. This is impossible to avoid. Ideally, to eliminate such matrix element effects one would average over all possible photon\nenergies, and experimental geometries. Here we have observed large variations along the antiferromagnetic zone\nboundary that are clear manifestations of the matrix element, while the asymmetric shift of weight towards (0,0)\nwith respect to the (\u03c0, 0) to (0, \u03c0) line suggests that this\nis a property of the underlying spectral function. Our\ninitial report implied that the underlying n(k) structure\nmatched that of the LDA Fermi surface at half filling\nwithout correlations.12 It is now clear, that the matrix\nelements are strong enough to make such a precise identification very difficult. However, we verify that an underlying asymmetry exists in the spectral function about\nthe antiferromagnetic zone boundary which is robust despite variations with photon energy. Whether it truly\nlies along the LDA Fermi surface, the antiferromagnetic\n\n10\n\n\f2nd Derivative\nPeak Position\nLeading Edge Midpoint\nRonning et al.

A\nstraight line corresponds to a simple d-wave dispersion. Each\ncurve was set to zero relative binding energy at the node.\nNote that the d-wave-like gap is in addition to the Mott gap\nwhich is not shown. The increased scatter as one approaches\n(\u03c0, 0) is indicative of the increased difficulty in tracing the\ndispersion away from (\u03c0/2, \u03c0/2).\n\nFIG. 15. (a) EDCs and (b) corresponding image plot of\nCa2 CuO2 Cl2 data taken along the antiferromagnetic zone\nboundary at 0.6\u25e6 intervals. (\u03c0/2, \u03c0/2) is indicated by the\nbold EDC and the dotted line in the image plot. Data collected at T=200K, 25.5eV photons, Resolution \u2206E = 15meV,\nand 0.8\u25e6 angular resolution\n\nalong the antiferromagnetic zone boundary and through\n(\u03c0/2, \u03c0/2). One observes a smooth round dispersion\nthrough (\u03c0/2, \u03c0/2). This is even more evident in the image plot of the same data. To compare with the d-wave\nfunctional form we must quantify the dispersion seen in\nthe raw spectra. The low energy features seen in the insulator are inherently very broad with a full width at half\nmaximum at (\u03c0/2, \u03c0/2) of 300meV, which is roughly the\ntotal dispersion seen in this material. Due to this, and\nthe fact that the higher energy spectral weight is also\ndispersive and of unknown origin, the significance of any\nparticular fit to the data is questionable. For this reason we have chosen to quantify the dispersion using three\nmethods: the peak maximum, the location of maximum\ncurvature, and the leading edge midpoint. We compare\nthese quantities against | cos kx a \u2212 cos ky a| in figure 16.\nThe straight line represents the simple d-wave scenario.\nNear the node it is clear that the dispersion is rounded\nin each case.\nOne plausible explanation for the flatness of the dispersion near (\u03c0/2, \u03c0/2) could be the dirty d-wave scenario. Previous ARPES work on underdoped Bi2212\nsamples also found a flattened dispersion near the node of\nthe superconducting and normal state low energy pseudo\ngaps.33\u201335 Earlier works suggested this was consistent\nwith a dirty d-wave scenario since a finite density of states\nwith zero excitation energy would result in a flattening\nof the node region. However, Mesot et al. argued that\nflattening due to impurities can be ruled out since pair\nbreaking due to impurities should cause the overall magnitude of the gap to decrease, while they observed the\nopposite.35 Furthermore, we note that ACOC is very stable and most likely very chemically pure as evidenced by\n\nmany unsuccessful attempts by many groups to dope the\noxychlorides under atmospheric conditions.36 The broadness of the peaks can not be used as evidence for impurities since the same feature is almost equally broad in\nBi2212 samples which contain nearly resolution limited\nquasiparticle peaks in their spectra in the superconducting state.37 Although one can not rule out the possibility\nthat the observed dispersion is due to impurities we will,\nfor the remainder of this paper, assume that the observed\nrounding is intrinsic to the undoped insulator, and discuss the consequences. We defer a full discussion on the\nlineshape of the insulator to another paper.38\n\nRelative Binding Energy (eV)\n\n0.0\n\n-0.1\n\n(\u03c0,\u03c0)\n\u03c6\n\n(0,\u03c0)\n\n(\u03c0,0)\n\n(0,0)\n\n-0.2\n\n2nd Derivative\nPeak Position\nLeading Edge Midpoint\nB=0.81; \u2206=390meV\nB=0.82; \u2206=410meV\nB=0.81; \u2206=330meV\n\n-0.3\n\n-0.4\n\n0\n\n20\n\n\u03c6 (degrees)\n\n40\n\n60\n\nFIG. 17.

B characterizes the deviation from a simple d-wave.\n\n11\n\n\fture with an increased Cu-O-Cu distance relative to systems with an apical oxygen. Clearly this is not significant enough to eliminate superconductivity in CCOC\nwith an a-axis lattice constant of 3.87\u00c5 but may be\nresponsible for the fact that SCOC, with a=3.97\u00c5 has\nnot yet been successfully doped into a superconductor.6\nAlthough band structure claims that the apical halide\nion does not appreciably enter the low energy density of\nstates of superconducting oxyhalides,43 one should note\nthat hole-doped superconductivity is observed in compounds containing an apical anion, while electron-doped\nsuperconductivity is found in systems missing an apical\natom. This suggests that the role of the apical atom is\nnot completely understood.\n\nIn an attempt to quantify the deviation from a simple d-wave picture we fit the data to \u2206|B cos(2\u03c6) + (1 \u2212\nB) cos(6\u03c6)| in figure 17, where \u03c6 is defined in the figure,\ncos(2\u03c6) is approximately | cos kx a \u2212 cos ky a|, and cos(6\u03c6)\nis the next allowable harmonic for d-wave symmetry. An\nincrease in the cos(6\u03c6) weight (smaller B) corresponds to\na flatter nodal region. Experimentally, we find B=0.81\u00b1\n0.01. This is smaller than any underdoped sample measured by Mesot et al., and thus is consistent with their\ninterpretation that the rounding is a result of increasing\nantiferromagnetic correlations.35\nFinally we note that the above data was taken at\nE\u03b3 =25.5eV. Identical results were obtained at E\u03b3 =29eV,\non a second cleave of CCOC at E\u03b3 =25.5eV, and on\nSCOC using 22.4eV photons. Improving the angular resolution by a factor of 4 by narrowing the slits of our\nanalyzer produced the same results.\n\nB. E\u03b3 Dependence\n\nReturning to the photon energy dependence of the\ncuprates, let us first consider the independence of the\nobserved dispersion E(k) on the choice of photon energy. In principle, there are several reasons which could\ncause E(k) to depend on photon energy which we list below. We know the cuprates are generally believed to be\ntwo dimensional electronic systems. In reality the wavefunctions have some finite ~z extent, and even if they are\nhighly localized will have some finite overlap with neighboring planes. In fact such a coupling must be present to\ncreate the observed three dimensional long range magnetic order seen at half filling. Certainly, if the wave\nfunction overlap were large enough to create a small dispersion as a function of kz a change in dispersion would\nbe observed with changing photon energy as this varies\nkz . Alternatively, if the matrix element had a significant\ndependence in the binding energy of the feature which\nvaried with photon energy, a photon energy dependent\ndispersion would also result. Along similar reasoning, if\nthere are multiple excitation branches there is no reason\nto expect that the matrix elements dependence on photon energy would be the same for each branch. Most\nlikely an observed variation with photon energy would\nbe caused by a combination of several of these factors.\nHowever, in figures 9 and 14 we have shown that the dispersion of the insulator is independent of photon energy\nto within our experimental uncertainty. Three dimensionality may still play a role in causing a small shift in\ndispersion with photon energy, but not surprisingly, it is\na safe assumption to treat the electronic structure of this\nhalf filled insulator as essentially two dimensional.\nWhat then is the significance of the observed underlying intensity modulation along the nodal direction which\nappears robust to variations in photon energy? In the\ncontext of specific many-body models such as the Hubbard model, there is numerical evidence that a structure in n(k) survives even when the on site Coulomb\nU drives the system insulating, even though the discontinuity in n(k) which existed in the metal has been\n\nIX. DISCUSSION\nA. System Independence\n\nBy examining A2 CuO2 X2 , (A=Sr, Ca; X=Cl, Br) and\nBi2 Sr2 MCu2 O8 (M=Er, Dy) we found that the dispersion of the lowest lying excitations in parent cuprates\nare independent of the particular system studied. Even\nthe results of the Cu3 O4 system, Sr2 Cu3 O4 Cl2 , were\nsimilar to the half-filled CuO2 systems. We further\nnote that, Nd2\u2212x Cex CuO4 and La2\u2212x Srx CuO4 near half\nfilling have been studied as well.2,3,39 For Nd2 CuO4 a\nshoulder on the edge of the valence band exists and exhibits a minimum binding energy at (\u03c0/2, \u03c0/2).3 Perhaps\nthis is the strongest evidence supporting the independence of the low energy electronic structure of half-filled\ncuprates on the apical site as it is completely unoccupied\nin Nd2 CuO4 . In La2 CuO4 , a broad shoulder exists at\n(\u03c0/2, \u03c0/2) at 0.5eV which disperse by roughly 200meV to\nhigher binding energy as it approaches (\u03c0, 0).2,39 It is also\ninteresting to note that the exchange coupling J, which\nenters into the parameterization of the low energy electronic structure, are nearly equivalent in La2 CuO4 (135\nmeV) and Sr2 CuO2 Cl2 (125 meV) as determined from\ninelastic neutron and two-magnon Raman scattering.40\nAll of these observations further support the universality to all cuprates of the dispersion of the lowest energy\nfeature seen in Sr2 CuO2 Cl2 and Ca2 CuO2 Cl2 .\nThe role of crystallographic structure on the low energy electronic structure and superconductivity is still\nnot well established. It was believed that the apical oxygen or structural distortion of the CuO2 planes\nwas necessary for superconductivity, but the observation of superconductivity in Na-doped Ca2 CuO2 Cl2 and\nSr2 CuO2 F2+\u03b4 has since rejected these beliefs.41,42 In Nadoped Ca2 CuO2 Cl2 no structural distortion was found\ndown to 10K while superconductivity was observed as\nhigh as 26K. Perhaps the apical Cl stabilizes a struc-\n\n12\n\n\fwashed out.28,30,44 This effect is linked to the fact that\nn(k) reflects the underlying Fermi statistics of the electronic system, where for the specific case of a two dimensional square lattice that resembles the CuO2 planes of\nthe cuprates, there is a drop in n(k) across a line that is\nclose to the antiferromagnetic zone boundary.28,30 This\ndiffers in the generalized t-J models where the structure\nin n(k) is washed out.30,45\nIn the metallic state of optimally doped Bi2212 the\nsteepest descent of n(k) gives a Fermi surface consistent\nwith traditional ARPES analysis methods despite the\ncomplication of matrix element effects as shown in figure\n12. In our earlier paper,12 the n(k) pattern of the insulator CCOC was found to be strikingly similar to the n(k)\npattern seen in Bi2212. This realization, coupled with\nmany-body theoretical calculations on various forms of\nthe Hubbard model28,30 , suggests that the insulator pattern contains information that is related to a Fermi surface which has been destroyed by strong electron-electron\ninteractions thus giving a qualitative concept of a remnant Fermi surface as the surface of steepest descent in\nn(k). In this paper we have found that the remnant\nFermi surface acts to emphasize a robust feature which\nwe observe in the insulator, although its precise shape\nis uncertain due to the effects of the matrix elements.\nWhile this may not be a rigorous definition, as the Fermi\nsurface is only defined for a metal, this useful concept\nallows a practical connection from the pseudogap seen in\nunderdoped cuprates to the properties of the insulator.13\nUnfortunately, the fact that the antiferromagnetic\nBrillouin zone boundary is quite similar to the underlying Fermi surface means that the roles of magnetism\nand that of the Fermi statistics of the underlying band\nstructure in this spectral weight pattern will be uncertain. Therefore we suggest here a few ideal tests on the\norigin of the n(k) pattern. One idea is to study a system\nwhose non-interacting Fermi surface is radically different\nfrom the magnetic Brillouin zone boundary. Since such\na system compatible with ARPES may be difficult to\nfind, perhaps a more realistic approach will be to study\na system similar to the cuprates, but where the magnetic\ncorrelations are much smaller, such that at the measured\ntemperature, effects due to magnetic correlations could\nbe ruled out.\nWe have shown that the loss in intensity as one crosses\nthe antiferromagnetic zone boundary is a robust feature\nof the insulator Ca2 CuO2 Cl2 which can not be explained\nsolely by matrix element effects. However, the photon energy dependence underscores the qualitative rather than\nquantitative nature of the remnant Fermi surface concept. We argue that much physics can be learned in spite\nof the adverse effects which matrix elements can have in\nARPES, as long as care is taken to properly sort out the\nintrinsic versus the extrinsic physics. In particular, the\nresulting connection between the d-wave like dispersion\nand the pseudogap in the underdoped regime is robust.\n\nC. d-wave-like Dispersion\n\nLet us now address the significance of the rounded dispersion at (\u03c0/2, \u03c0/2). Numerical calculations show that\nthe t-J model describes the dispersion from (0,0) to (\u03c0, \u03c0)\nwell, but incorrectly predicts the energy at (\u03c0/2, \u03c0/2) and\n(\u03c0, 0) to be equal28 . The addition of t\u2032 and t\u2032\u2032 corrects\nthis problem46 and for realistic values of these parameters, also gives an isotropic dispersion which is scaled\nby a single parameter J.47 The effect of adding t\u2032 and\nt\u2032\u2032 to calculations is to destabilize the single hole N\u00e9el\nstate about (\u03c0, 0). The resulting state appears to be\na spin liquid which may display spin charge separation,\nbut this only occurs about (\u03c0, 0).47,48 Perhaps this explains why RVB theories, which assume spin charge separation throughout the entire zone, incorrectly predict a\ncusp at (\u03c0/2, \u03c0/2) in the spinon dispersion while still correctly describing the overall dispersion on a qualitative\nlevel.13,15\nThe mean field treatment in a simple SDW picture\napplied to the Hubbard model with up to third nearest neighbor hopping fails to describe the data.47 The\ndispersion along (\u03c0, 0) to (0, \u03c0) is much too great for realistic parameters. However, the dispersion does contain a rounded nodal region. If one can argue that one\nshould renormalize these parameters then it is possible\nto obtain a very good fit to the experimental data as\ndone by Nu\u00f1ez-Regueiro49 where they also show that\nthe magnitude of the overall dispersion decreases with\ndoping as has been seen in the high energy pseudogap.\nAlternatively, a diagrammatic expansion of the Hubbard\nmodel containing t\u2032 and t\u2032\u2032 as well as the QED3 theory\nalso reproduce the observed dispersion.50,51 Finally, the\nSO(5) theory predicts a | cos kx a \u2212 cos ky a| dispersion for\nthe insulator when the superconductor has simple d-wave\npairing.16 However, in the projected SO(5), the observed\nflattening of the node in the insulator is consistent with\na flattened dispersion observed near the node of the superconducting gap.52\nD. Ek isotropy of (\u03c0/2, \u03c0/2)\n\nBy combining our investigation of the nodal direction\nwith that of the rounding along the antiferromagnetic\nzone boundary we can get a measure of the isotropy of\nthe dispersion at (\u03c0/2, \u03c0/2) shown in figure 18. The data\ndemonstrates a clear anisotropy in the two directions.\nHowever, it should be noted that in tracking the dispersion from the EDC's that the total dispersion in both\ndirections does not exceed 350meV. It is only due to the\nimproved momentum resolution that we get a clear indication of the existence of some anisotropy in the dispersion about (\u03c0/2, \u03c0/2). It should be noted that the full\ndispersion in the nodal direction is difficult to extract\ndue to a loss of spectral weight at (0,0) which has historically been attributed to matrix elements. A similar\n\n13\n\n\fRelative Binding Energy (eV)\n\nuid picture may be more appropriate for interpreting the\nARPES data.47,48 However, generalized t-J models fail\nto reproduce the observed asymmetric intensity profile\nwhich is reproduced in the Hubbard model.28,30 Possibly\nthe Hubbard model including next nearest neighbor hopping terms50 is necessary to capture all the physics of a\nsingle hole in the half-filled CuO2 plane.\n\n0.00\n-0.05\n-0.10\n-0.15\n-0.20\nAFZB\nnodal direction\n\n-0.25\n-0.30\n0.35\n\n0.40\n\n0.45\n\n0.50\n\n0.55\n\n0.60\n\nXI.

CONCLUSIONS\n\nTo summarize, we have studied the Mott-insulating\ncuprates: Sr2 CuO2 Cl2 , Ca2 CuO2 Cl2 , Ca2 CuO2 Br2 ,\nSr2 Cu3 O4 Cl2 , Bi2 Sr2 ErCu2 O8 , and Bi2 Sr2 DyCu2 O8 .\nThe lowest energy excitations measured by ARPES are\nthe same in these compounds as for the prototypical insulators: Sr2 CuO2 Cl2 and Ca2 CuO2 Cl2 . Other studies on\nLa2\u2212x Srx CuO4 and Nd2 CuO4 have similar results.2,3,39\nThis shows that the low energy excitations are indeed independent of the apical atom, and that the results from\nSr2 CuO2 Cl2 and Ca2 CuO2 Cl2 are truly representative\nof a half-filled CuO2 plane. This justifies the connection between the high energy pseudogap observed in underdoped Bi2212 and the d-wave-like modulation seen in\nACOC.12,13 Our photon energy dependent study enables\nus to extract the intrinsic spectral function which shows\nthat the dispersion is indeed independent of photon energy, and that despite strong variations due to the matrix\nelements an asymmetry exists in the n(k) about the line\nfrom (\u03c0, 0) to (0, \u03c0). We find that the dispersion along\nthis contour does not fit a simple d-wave dispersion, but is\nflattened near (\u03c0/2, \u03c0/2) consistent with a similar rounding observed in underdoped Bi2212 samples.33\u201335 Numerical calculations on the t-t\u2032 -t\u2032\u2032 -J model which match all\naspects of the insulator dispersion including the rounded\nnodal region, show that the antiferromagnetic correlations are destroyed near (\u03c0, 0), indicating that a spin liq-\n\n1\n\nN.F.
