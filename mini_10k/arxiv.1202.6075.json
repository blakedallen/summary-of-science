A two-mixing-angle\nscheme has also been suggested in the study of the\nmixing of decay constants [3].\nThe mixing angle can neither be calculated from\nfirst principles in QCD nor measured directly \u2013 it\nhas to be determined phenomenologically. There\nare a lot of studies on this subject using different\nmethods and a number of different processes, including various decay processes involving the light\npseudoscalar mesons [1\u20136].\nOne important source of information in determining the mixing angle is the transition processes, \u03b3\u03b3 \u2217 \u2192 \u03b7, \u03b7 \u2032 for which the transition from\n\nfactors (TFFs), F\u03b7\u03b3 (Q2 ) and F\u03b7\u2032 \u03b3 (Q2 ) with Q2 being the virtuality of the off-mass-shell photon, are\ndefined. The usual procedure [7] using the TFFs\nto evaluate the \u03b7-\u03b7 \u2032 mixing angle is to calculate\nthe Q2 dependence of these transition form factors\nand compare with the experimental data which are\ngiven at a certain range of Q2 [8\u201310]. However,\ntheoretical calculations for the TFFs at finite Q2\nsuffer sizable corrections and are sensitive to the\nnon-perturbative model used for the distribution\namplitude of the mesons, which results in large\nuncertainties in determining the mixing angle.\nTwo analytical constraints on the \u03b7-\u03b7 \u2032 mixing were obtained in [11] by considering the twophoton decays of \u03b7 and \u03b7 \u2032 and the asymptotic behavior of the \u03b7 and \u03b7 \u2032 TFFs in the limit Q2 \u2192 \u221e,\ntogether with the fact that the asymptotic behavior of the meson TFFs is firmly predicted by QCD\n[12]. Newly available BABAR data [10] extend the\nmeasurements for the \u03b7 and \u03b7 \u2032 TFFs to higher\nQ2 and to a much larger range of Q2 , and thus\nprovide new information for the \u03b7 and \u03b7 \u2032 TFFs\nat Q2 \u2192 \u221e. At the same time experimental information on the masses and two-photon decay\nwidths of mesons involved are improved considerably over the last decade. These new experimental\ndata shall have an impact on the determining of\nthe \u03b7-\u03b7 \u2032 mixing parameters.\nIn this paper we extract the Q2 \u2192 \u221e behavior\nof the \u03b7 and \u03b7 \u2032 TFFs from the BABAR data. Using\nthis new information and updated experimental\ndata about the two-photon decays \u03b7 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 and\n\u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 [13], we determine the \u03b7-\u03b7 \u2032 mixing angle\nand the ratios of decay constants in the two mixing\nschemes [see Eqs. (1) and (2)] using the method\nof [11].\nThe analytical expressions obtained in [11] for\nthe mixing angle \u03b8 and the ratio of the decay constants of the \u03b71 and \u03b78 states r = f1 /f8 are\n\n\f2\ntan \u03b8 =\n\n\u2212(1 + c2 )(\u03c11 + \u03c12 ) +\n\nr=\n\nwhere c =\n\n\u221a\n8 and\n\"\n\u03c11 =\n\n\u03c12 =\n\np\n(1 + c2 )2 (\u03c11 + \u03c12 )2 + 4(c2 \u2212 \u03c11 \u03c12 )(1 \u2212 c2 \u03c11 \u03c12 )\n,\n2(c2 \u2212 \u03c11 \u03c12 )\n\n(1 + c2 )(\u03c11 \u2212 \u03c12 ) +\n\n\u0393\u03b7\u2192\u03b3\u03b3 m3\u03b7\u2032\n\u0393\u03b7\u2032 \u2192\u03b3\u03b3 m3\u03b7\n\n#1/2\n\n,\n\nF\u03b7\u03b3 (Q2 \u2192 \u221e)\n.\nF\u03b7\u2032 \u03b3 (Q2 \u2192 \u221e)\n\np\n(1 + c2 )2 (\u03c11 \u2212 \u03c12 )2 + 4c2 (1 + \u03c11 \u03c12 )2\n,\n2c(1 + \u03c11 \u03c12 )\n\n(5)\n(6)\n\nOne advantage of determining the mixing parameters from Eqs. (3)-(6) is that both the theoretical uncertainty incurred in calculating the\nTFFs at finite Q2 and the experimental uncertainty are minimized by considering the ratios of\nthe decay widths for the two-photon decay processes and the ratios of the transition form factors\nat large Q2 .\nFurthermore, considering the ratio of the decay\nwidths for the \u03c0 0 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 and \u03b7 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 processes, we\ncan also determine the ratios f8 /f\u03c0 and f1 /f\u03c0 ,\n\u0014\n\u0015\nc8\n1 c1\nf8\n= \u03c10\ncos \u03b8 \u2212\nsin \u03b8 ,\n(7)\nf\u03c0\nc\u03c0\nr c\u03c0\n\u0015\n\u0014\nc8\nc1\nf1\n= \u03c10\nr cos \u03b8 \u2212\nsin \u03b8 ,\n(8)\nf\u03c0\nc\u03c0\nc\u03c0\n\u221a\n\u221a \u221a\nwhere c\u03c0 = 1, c8 = 1/ 3, c1 = 2 2/ 3, and\n\"\n#1/2\n\u0393\u03c00 \u2192\u03b3\u03b3 m3\u03b7\n\u03c10 =\n.\n(9)\n\u0393\u03b7\u2192\u03b3\u03b3 m3\u03c00\nThe above analysis can be easily applied to the\nquark-flavor basis mixing scheme [see Eq.

We employ the data given by the 2010\nParticle Data Group (PDG2010) [13],\n\u0393\u03c00 \u2192\u03b3\u03b3 = 7.74 \u00b1 0.46 eV,\n\u0393\u03b7\u2192\u03b3\u03b3 = 0.510 \u00b1 0.026 keV,\n\u0393\u03b7\u2032 \u2192\u03b3\u03b3 = 4.28 \u00b1 0.19 keV,\n\n(10)\n\nm\u03c00 = 134.9766 \u00b1 0.0006 MeV,\nm\u03b7 = 547.853 \u00b1 0.024 MeV,\nm\u03b7\u2032 = 957.78 \u00b1 0.06 MeV.\n\n(11)\n\n(3)\n\n(4)\n\nWe will use the CLEO [9] and BABAR [10] data\nfor the TFFs at large Q2 to determine the parameter \u03c12 .

The\nresults were not presented in the mono-pole form\n[Eq. (12)], partially because their results for the\npion-photon transition from factor exhibit a very\nquick growth for Q2 > 15 GeV2 [15], which is\nvery hard to explain in QCD [16]. However, this\ntrend of fast growth is noticeably missing from the\nBABAR data for the \u03b7-photon and \u03b7 \u2032 -photon transition form factors, and thus the BABAR data for the\n\u03b7-photon and \u03b7 \u2032 -photon transition form factors are\nconsistent with perturbative QCD calculations for\nthe form factors and shall be described with the\nmono-pole form as given by Eq. (12).\nWe use QCD-motivated mono-pole form\nEq. (12) to fit experimental data. The values\nof \u039b\u03b7 and \u039b\u2032\u03b7 in Eq. (12) determined using the\nCLEO data, BABAR data, and the combined data\nare presented in Table I. We have combined the\nstatistical and systematic errors for the CLEO\ndata in quadrature since the BABAR data are\npresented with only combined errors. The values\nof \u03c72 /d.o.f given in the table provide further\njustification for the use of Eq. (12) in describing\nthese data. The values of \u039b\u03b7 and \u039b\u2032\u03b7 determined\nwith the CLEO and BABAR data agree within\ntheir uncertainties, but the BABAR data greatly\nimprove the accuracy in determining the values\nof \u039b\u03b7 and \u039b\u2032\u03b7 . Using the combined data in the\nfitting changes the results slightly.\nThe parameter \u039bP has a natural explanation as\nthe pole mass of vector meson in the vector meson\n\n\f3\ndominated model for the TFFs. The values we\nobtained, \u039b\u03b7 \u223c 780 MeV and \u039b\u03b7 \u223c 860 MeV, are\nvery close to the masses of \u03c1 (770 MeV) and K \u2217\n(890 MeV).\nThe results for the mixing angle and decay constants determined using the CLEO data, BABAR\ndata, and the combined data, together with the\ntwo-photon decay widths, are presented in Tables\nII and III for the \u03b78 -\u03b71 mixing scheme and quarkflavor basis mixing scheme, respectively. The mixing angle obtained in this work, \u03c6 \u2243 37\u25e6 \u223c 38\u25e6\nis slightly smaller than the central value of 39.8\u25e6\nobtained in [11]. This is mainly due to an increase\nin the estimation for the \u0393\u03b7\u2192\u03b3\u03b3 by the 2010 Particle Data Group. This increase also affects the\nresults for the ratios of decay constants slightly.\nThe uncertainties for the mixing angles and the\nratios f1 /f8 and fs /fq obtained in this work are\nconsiderably smaller than that given in [11] due to\nthe new more accurate experimental data for the\nmeson masses, the two-photon decay widths, and\nthe meson-photon transition form factors. The uncertainties for the other ratios of decay constants,\nf8 /f\u03c0 and f1 /f\u03c0 in the \u03b78 -\u03b71 mixing scheme and\nfq /f\u03c0 and fs /f\u03c0 in the quark-flavor basis mixing\nscheme, are also generally smaller than that estimated in [11].\nOur results for the mixing angle are in agreement with recent results of \u03c6 \u2243 37\u25e6 \u223c 42\u25e6 ob-\n\n[1] C.

The value of f8 /f\u03c0\nobtained in this work is smaller than that obtained with Chiral Perturbation Theory (ChPT)\nat next-to-leading order [4] and some phenomenological analyses [6], but is larger than the result reported in [5]. We note that the ChPT result may\nbe alerted by higher order corrections. As it has\nbeen pointed out in [11], in the previous studies\neither the questionable assumption that the decay\nconstants and the particle states share the same\nmixing scheme or two mixing-angle scheme was\nadopted. The relations between the mixing parameters involved in the two-mixing-angle scheme\nand that appear in our model remain to be further\nstudied.\nIn summary, understanding the composition of\nthe light pseudoscalar mesons \u03b7 and \u03b7 \u2032 is of great\nimportance in the study of many hadron processes\ninvolved these mesons. Employing the two analytical constrains on the \u03b7-\u03b7 \u2032 mixing proposed by\nus in a previous work, we extracted the \u03b7-\u03b7 \u2032 mixing angle and the ratios of decay constants in two\nwidely-used mixing schemes using recently available BABAR measurements on the \u03b7-photon and \u03b7 \u2032 photon transition form factors and more accurate\nexperimental data for the masses and two-photon\ndecay widths of the light pseduoscalar mesons.\nF.G. thanks X.-H.
