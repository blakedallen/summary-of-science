This has led some authors to define complex and living systems as living at the 'edge of\nchaos', [1, 2, 3, 4] meaning \u2013in a somewhat picturesque\nway\u2013 that it takes only tiny changes in the system to\nmove it from a stable and regular mode into a chaotic\nphase where large portions of phase space can get sampled. The concept is that systems at the edge of chaos\nare especially well suited for adaptation and information\nprocessing in the sense that adaptability is associated by\nthe possibility of finding adequate new states in possibly\nchanged environments at very fast rates. It has been argued that living systems at the edge of chaos would get\nfavored by natural selection, and that life has evolved towards such a special region in parameter space [2]. In\nmany dynamical systems the edge of chaos is a very special set of points in parameter space, often of measure\nzero, characterized by the system's maximal Lyapunov\nexponent \u03bb passing through zero. It is not clear how\nsystems can get regulated towards (or have evolved towards) such a limited set of critical points, even though\nsome interesting ideas have been proposed in this direction [5]. Even in the simplest maps like the logistic map,\nthe dynamics exactly at these special points can become\nhighly non-trivial [6].\nIt is evident that living systems have evolved towards\nstable systems in stationary disequilibrium. Various authors argue that a key principle of living systems is their\nability to replicate [7]; corresponding rate equations for\nmolecular replicators have been proposed for a long time,\nbeginning with [8]. As such, basic molecular reactions in\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\naddress: thurner@univie.ac.at\n\nliving systems (e.g. protein production or degradation)\nhave to be autocatalytic. If autocatalytic reactions are\nnot balanced by degradation and/or thermostatic netflow of substance to and fro the system (like in a flow\nreactor), concentrations of molecular products will diverge in the replicator. A stationary state can be established when production and decay (flow) rates of inter\ncellular molecules effectively balance each other, [9, 10].\nIn this sense stability (stationarity) provides a natural\nselection criterion. Catalytic reactions are simply described by reaction networks, which contain production\nand degradation rates. Given current developments in\ngenomics- and proteomics technology some facts about\nthese networks become known. By now there is some\nevidence that these (directed) networks show scale-free\n(SF) topological organization [11, 12]. On the basis of a\ngiven molecular reaction topology [13] several gene network models have been proposed [14, 15, 16]. In principle\ntwo different approaches have been pursued: discrete approaches, using Boolean networks [17] and continuous approaches, using ordinary or stochastic differential equations [18, 19, 20, 21]. Combinations of both have also\nbeen reported [22, 23].\nRecently the importance of noise in molecular reaction\nnetworks has been stressed and its relevance has been experimentally demonstrated [24, 25, 26]. For example the\nlevel of noise can determine whether cells in Drosophila\nbecome epidermal or neural cells [27]. Further it was\nshown that low reproduction rates of DNA and important regulatory molecules forbid to neglect stochastic effects [28]. Intrinsic noise, microscopic events within the\ncell, and extrinsic noise, such as cell to cell variations,\nare experimentally distinguishable [29]. In this context a\nstochastic differential equation model has been proposed\nfor regulatory transcription networks [30].\nIn this work we study a simple linear, noise driven\ndissipative model for catalytic molecular reactions. We\nimpose a non-linearity to this system by assuming that\nconcentrations can not become negative. We demon-\n\n\f2\nstrate that this non-linearity changes the 'the edge of\nchaos' from a point where \u03bb = 0, to extended regions of\nvanishing Lyapunov exponents. The model offers a way\nto understand how systems naturally evolve and adapt\ntowards a widened 'edge of chaos'.\nII.\n\nwith \u03bei \u2208 N (0, \u03c3\u0304) and \u03b7i \u2208 N (0, \u03c3) the multiplicative and\nadditive noise components respectively. Multiplicative\nand additive noise can be interpreted as intrinsic and\nextrinsic noise as used e.g. in [29]. Both intrinsic and\nextrinsic noise are present in gene networks.\nTo be able to interpret x as concentrations we have to\nintroduce the constraint\n\nTHE MODEL\n\nxi (t) \u2265 0\nWe assume that gene to gene interactions can be modeled as chemical reactions between proteins, mRNA and\nother nucleic material. Let us denote the concentrations\nof proteins i at time t by the vector pi (t) and of RNA\nmolecules j by rj (t). For convenience let us combine all\ntypes of concentrations into a single vector x \u2261 (~\np, ~r).\nThe size of the vector (number of products) we denote\nby N . The simplest linear model to capture all possible\ninteractions is given by\nd\nxi =\ndt\n\nX\n\nA0ij xj\n\n,\n\n(1)\n\nj\n\nwhere A0 is the matrix of reaction rates. Even though\nthis model is clearly an over-simplification of reality it has\nbeen frequently used recently [15, 31, 32]. Let us assume\nthat these rates are not perfect constants but fluctuate\naccording to A0ij (t) = Aij + \u03beij (t), for example through\nthermal noise. For simplicity let \u03beij be an iid process\nwith zero mean. Replacing A0 by A we get\nX\nX\nd\nAij xj + \u03beii (t)xi +\n\u03beij (t)xj\nxi =\ndt\nj\n\n.\n\n(2)\n\nj6=i\n\nRegardless of the distribution of \u03beij , and assuming that\nx will converge to a reasonably stationary distribution,\naccording to the central limit theorem, the sum of the\nright hand side will yield a random number from a Gaussian distribution, which we shall denote by \u03b7i \u2208 N (0, \u03c3).\nFor simplicity we shall assume \u03beii also Gaussian, i.e.\n\u03beii \u2261 \u03bei \u2208 N (0, \u03c3\u0304)with the same variance \u03c3\u0304 \u2200i. We need a\nfinal addition of our model Eq. (2), to incorporate a further experimental observation. Many gene-products (e.g.\nmRNA levels) fluctuate around some characteristic value,\nx0i , across the cell cycle. In Fig. 1a we show the expression levels for mRNA levels of 10 randomly picked genes\nfrom the yeast genome (S.cerevisae) over 2 cell cycles at\n17 time points taken at 10 minute intervals [33, 34]. The\nnumber of measured genes in the budding yeast genome\nwas N = 6220. To incorporate these characteristic levels\nwe chose values x0i from some distribution. In Fig 1b we\nshow the experimental distribution of mRNA expression\nlevels of the yeast genome, defined as the time-average\nover cell cycles. x0i = hxi (t)it . In the following x0i is\ntaken from uniform, Gaussian or the experimental distribution. This fixes our model to be\nX\nd\nA0ij (xj \u2212 x0j ) + \u03bei (t)xi + \u03b7i\nxi =\ndt\nj\n\n,\n\n(3)\n\n\u2200i\n\n,\n\n(4)\n\nwhich means that regardless of \u1e8bi of (3), xi (t) can never\nbe below zero. This imposes a non-linearity onto the\nsystem and makes it non-trivial.\n\nA.\n\nThe interaction matrix\n\nBefore solving the system we have to specify the interaction network, i.e. the matrix elements (chemical rates)\nof A. It is obvious that the network will be directed and\nweighted. Diagonal elements Aii < 0 are decay rates\nof the products, off-diagonal rates Aij can be both positive or negative, corresponding to activation or inhibition. Further, it is clear that first not all products can\ninteract with each other, i.e. a large number of matrix\nelements will be zero, and second most rates are not available from experiments. We are thus led to model A as a\nrandom matrix in the following way. Using terminology\nfrom network theory the 'degree' ki of product i is defined as the number of products that can be regulated by\nproduct i. The class of interaction networks can now be\nspecified by the 'degree distribution'. There is evidence\nthat protein networks [12] and metabolic networks [13]\nare scale-free networks p(k) \u223c k \u2212\u03b3 , characterized by a\ndegree distribution with average degree hki > 4, and an\nexponent \u03b3 \u223c 2.2. In the following we generate such networks and contrast them to classical random networks,\ni.e. Erd\u00f6s-Renyi graphs (ER) [35? ] with the same average degree. If the number of non-zero rates in A is\ndenoted by L, the average connectivity is hki = L/N .\nOnce it is decided which products interact with each\nother, i.e. Aij 6= 0, the actual rates have to be fixed.\nWe assume these being Gaussian, Aij \u2208 N (0, \u03c3A ). This\nis supported experimentally e.g. by [32], where a least\nsquares fit of synthetic gene network models to real\ndata indicates that the normal distribution of interaction weights gives the best results. The (negative) decay\nrates Aii we take constant and equal \u2200i in the following.\n\nB.\n\nA note on multiplicative noise\n\nNote that the diagonal component of Eq. (3) \u2013 ignoring\nthe positivity constraint \u2013 immediately reminds at the\nstochastic differential equation,\nd\nx = f (x) + g(x)\u03be(t) + \u03b7(t)\ndt\n\n,\n\n(5)\n\n\f3\n\n3\n\n10\nx\n\n2\n\n10\n\n(a)\n1\n\n10\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\n\n14\n\n16\n\nt\n300\n3\n\n10\n250\n\n2\n\n200\n\nP(>x0)\n\nwith \u03b2 = (\u2212Aii + \u03c3\u0304/2)/\u03c3, where (1 \u2212 q)\u22121 is the asymptotic power exponent. In Fig. 1c we show experimental data confirming the power law aspect of mRNA concentrations in yeast in the same data [33]. \u2206xi (t) \u2261\nxi (t) \u2212 xi (t \u2212 1) is the difference in gene expression levels between two consecutive measurements; P (> \u2206x) is\nthe cumulative distribution, for all i and t. In the same\nplot we show results of a numerical simulation of the\nmodel Eq. (3) with the N = 6000 ER topology for A\nat hki = 20, for the two cases: first, \u03c3\u0304 = 0 and \u03c3 > 0\n(Gaussian noise model), and second \u03c3\u0304 > 0 and \u03c3 = 0\n(multiplicative noise model). Further a q-exponential fit\n[42] to the data is shown (broken line), with an effective\nqcum = 1.55 .\n\n4\n\n10\n\nP(x0)\n\nwith f = \u2212Aii x and g(x) = x. This Langevin process\nhas been exactly solved [36], the solution (probability\ndistribution of x) being a q-exponential,\n\u00031/(1\u2212q)\n\u0002\n,\n(6)\np(x) \u223c 1 + (q \u2212 1)\u03b2x2\n\n150\n\n10\n\n1\n\n10\n\n100\n0\n\nC.\n\nStability\n\n10 0\n10\n\n50\n\n2\n\n4\n\n10\nx\n\n10\n\n0\n\nIf the diagonal elements of the random matrix are from\na zero-mean distribution, Girko's circle is centered at the\norigin of the complex plane. In our case we have Aii < 0\nand the center of the circle will be shifted to the position\n(\u2212Aii , 0), see e.g. [39].\nNow, including the positivity constraint and the\nstochastic dynamics, it is obvious that the eigenvalue\nspectrum of A will only be a part of the story. To define a\nmeasure for system stability that captures these aspects,\nmaybe the simplest choice is the maximal Lyapunov exponent\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1\nk\u03b4x(t)k\n\u03bb \u2261 lim ln\n,\n(8)\nt\u2192\u221e t\nk\u03b4x(0)k\n\n0\n0\n\n1000\n\n2000\n\n3000\nx0\n\n4000\n\n5000\n\n6000\n\n5\n\n10\n\n4\n\n10\n\nP(>\u2206x)\n\nBiological systems are sufficiently stable, i.e. products\nare not produced ad infinitum, and at the same time are\nsufficiently dynamical. If our model is reasonable we have\nto find the regions in parameter-space where such nontrivial stability is ensured. If we ignore for a moment the\npositivity condition, Eq. (4), and the stochastic terms\nin Eq. (3), the stability of the system is dominated by\nthe largest real part of the eigenvalues of the interaction\nmatrix A. If there are no non-negative real parts of the\neigenvalues, the system will be asymptotically stable.

(3), now with\npositivity condition and compare with the above predictions. For numerical simulations we generated scale-free\n(SF) and ER networks of sizes of N = 200, 500, 1000. To\nvary hki we adjusted the number of non-zero rates L in\nthe matrix A. For scale-free networks we fixed the scaling exponent \u03b3 = 2.2. All the following results are averages over 20 random realizations of networks for a given\nparameter set. The Lyapunov exponents were computed\nfrom datasets of 1000 timepoints, after discarding the initial 200 timesteps. x0 was chosen from the experimental\ndistribution of Fig. 1b.

For long enough times the expected\nnumber of these trajectories will be half of the total number, N/2. This amounts to a reduction of system size by\none half (with fixed connectedness), i.e. N \u2192 Neff = N/2\nand L \u2192 Leff = L/4. For connectivity this means,\nhki \u2192 hkeff i = hki/2. We would thus expect the asymptotic (large hki) behavior of \u03bb of the full model as a function of connectivity\nr\nhki\n\u2212 Aii ,\n(10)\n\u03bb(hki) \u223c \u03c3A\n2\n\n0.5\n\n0\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n\u3008k\u3009\n\n150\n\n200\n\n250\n\nFIG. 2: Maximum Lyapunov exponents \u03bb as a function of\naverage degree hki, averaged over 20 realizations, for ER networks. The influence of the positivity condition on forming\na plateau is immediately seen. Simulations are shown with\n(\u03c3 = \u03c3\u0304 = 0.1) and without (\u03c3 = \u03c3\u0304 = 0) noise, N = 500,\nAii = \u22120.4. Lines are Eqs. (9) and (10).\n\nchanges of results when using uniform or Gaussian distributions. In Fig. 2 we show the solution for \u03bb for the\nER network, as a function of hki, with (triangles) and\nwithout (circles) positivity condition. The corresponding theoretical predictions Eqs. (9) and (10), are drawn\nas broken and solid lines, respectively. The case without positivity condition is completely explained by theory over the entire range of hki, Eq. (9). In the case\nwith the constraint the asymptote follows Eq. (10), as\nexpected. It is also seen that for small hki, Eq. (9) is\nvalid. The main finding of this paper is that within a\nhki-window between about 10 and 30 a plateau forms\nwhere \u03bb practically vanishes. The constraint dynamics\nallows a full range of connectivities to support a 'life at\nthe edge of chaos'.\nThe stability of the system for different network\ntopologies, sizes and various noise components is shown\nin Fig. 3. Figure 3a indicates that both, network size\nand degree distribution are slightly influencing the width\nof the plateau. While in the hki \u2192 N region there is no\nsignificant difference in system stability, the low connectivity region shows a size effect on the \u03bb = 0 plateau.\nThe effect of network topology is relatively small, the\ncurve pertaining to SF always being slightly below the\nER networks, see Fig. 3a. While the width of the\nplateau is always wider for the random distribution of\nlinks, in the hki \u2192 0 region, the system is more stable (smaller \u03bb) for SF networks. For higher connectivity\nregions (hki & 30) the difference between random and\nscale-free networks becomes indistinguishable due to numerical inaccuracy. Figure 3b shows the influence of pure\nmultiplicative (\u03c3\u0304 > 0, \u03c3 = 0) and pure additive noise\n(\u03c3\u0304 = 0, \u03c3 > 0) on the plateau width, compared to the\ndeterministic process, \u03c3\u0304 = \u03c3 = 0.

(15), \u223c hki\u22121 .\nThe key to understanding the formation of the plateau\nlies in the fact that \u03c3A is not a constant. When \u03bb \u2192 0,\nand nodes start becoming inactive, this amounts to effectively reducing the interaction matrix. For each product i\nhitting zero, this means that row and column of matrix A\ncan be dropped. (In biological terms, once the concentration of some product type reaches zero, these molecules\nstop playing a role in the regulation of other products,\nthe effective regulation network consisting just of active\nnodes (xi > 0), gets smaller.) The key observation is that\nthis does not leave the variance of the matrix elements\nAij unchanged, but systematically reduces the variance\nthe more nodes become inactive. This can be seen as a\nselection mechanism in which the most active reactions\n(largest reaction rates in A) will hit the boundary first,\nand will be the first ones to be removed on average. This\nmechanism drives the system to a self-organized critical\nstate at \u03bb = 0. We show the situation in Fig. 3d; \u03c3A\ndeclines with the number of inactive nodes N \u2212 Non , as\nexpected. With further increasing hki the number of inactive products saturates at half the network size and Eq.\n(10) holds.\n\nIV.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nWe have studied the stability of a simple stochastic\nmodel of catalytic reaction equations for cellular products such as mRNA molecules or proteins. The system is\ndriven by intrinsic molecular noise (multiplicative) and\nexternal (additive) noise. We show that the model captures some essential experimental features, such as the\nfat tail distribution of concentration changes. Imposing\nan intuitively natural constraint on the system, (nonnegativity of concentrations) we observe the forming of a\n\n\f6\nplateau of vanishing Lyapunov exponents. The dynamical stability of concentrations in catalytic regulatory networks, defined with Eq. (3) has three extended phases in\nparameter space (here connectivity). In the first phase\nthe system is asymptotically stable, \u03bb is negative. After\nbeing exposed to a random perturbation in this phase\nthe system always relaxes to its steady state x0 . The\nmain finding of this work is the existence of a second\nphase, where \u03bb \u223c 0 extends over extended regions. This\nis in marked contrast to the dynamics of many other\nnon-linear systems, which have \u03bb = 0 only at a set of\npoints. The emergence of this phase can be fully explained within the model. At higher connectivities some\nproducts will start to reach the boundary. Those products with the largest reaction rates will \u2013 on average \u2013\nhit the boundary first. These are then removed from the\nsystem. This means that the variance of the effective\nreaction rates will get driven downward as a function of\nconnectivity. The variance of rates and the number of\nactive nodes balance each other to exactly arrive at the\ncritical point \u03bb = 0. This is a self-organized critical effect. A physical analogy is the evaporation at boiling\n\ntemperature, where molecules of higher-than-average energy leave the liquid first, keeping the (critical) temperature at the boiling point. The third phase is defined by\n\u03bb > 0 where system is dynamically unstable and concentration levels are diverging. We studied the dependence\nof the \u03bb = 0 plateau on two network topologies, ER and\nSF, where a remarkably small effect was found. We found\nthat with multiplicative noise the size of the plateau can\nbe varied while additive noise showed relatively little effect. For strong enough noise levels of either type the\nplateau breaks down.\nIn [41] it was noted that neural networks can perform\nmost complex computations if the dynamics of random\nthreshold gate networks is at the critical boundary between the ordered and chaotic regime. If we interpret\ngene-regulatory networks as computing devices performing hundreds of optimization problems simultaneously, it\nis plausible that evolution would have selected among the\nmost efficient variations \u2013 working at the edge of chaos.\nThis project was supported by WWTF Life Science\nGrant LS 139, and by the Austrian Science Fund FWF,\nproject P19132.\n\n[1] C.
