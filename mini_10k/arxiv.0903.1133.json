On the other hand, in an even wider time-frame, properties of quantum-mechanical\nsystems have proven to be of interest from the perspective of game theory [BT08, EWL99, BH01],\ninformation theory [NC00, Jae07, BS98], and distributed systems [BT08, DP08]. One such major\nline of study concerns applying quantum effects in order to reduce communication complexity,\ni.e., to decrease the number of communication bits required to solve a specific task performed\nin a system with several distributed agents. When expressed in the language of distributed\ncomputing, such research is roughly trying to address the question: Can quantum effects be used\nto enhance distributed computations with messages of bounded size, in settings inspired by the\nCON GEST distributed model1 ?\nThe quantum variant of CON GEST , widely studied in physics, is known as the LOCC\nmodel2 . It exploits the key quantum-mechanical concept of an entangled state (see e.g. [NC00,\nHHH96]). This is achieved by altering the initialization phase of the system to allow for a\nstarting state entangled among all the processors, which are locally given quantum computation\ncapabilities; however, communication between processors is still restricted to the exchange of\nclassical information, only. This application of pre-entanglement has been shown to decrease\nthe number of communication bits required to solve certain distributed problems with output\ncollected from one node, and consequently, to decrease the number of required communication\nrounds when message sizes are bounded (see e.g. [CGL99] for the first proof-of-concept example,\nor [\u017b08] for a survey of related results). Many other works on the subject have focused on\ncharacterising the physical evolution of states attainable in the LOCC model [Nie99, OMM04,\ndNDVB07], while other authors have dealt with the combinatorial complexity of distributing the\nentangled state over the whole system in the initialization phase [SKP04]. Other modifications\nof the model attempt to show that a denser coding of information in transmitted messages\nis possible when using quantum channels, as compared to classical communication links (see\ne.g. [BCdWZ99]).\n\nRelated work. Very recently, some authors have begun to study the impact of quantum\neffects on fundamental concepts of the theory of distributed computing. An overview of this\nline of research is contained in the recent survey paper by Denchev and Pandurangan [DP08].\nOne especially interesting result is that the leader election problem can be solved in distributed\nsystems with quantum links, but no pre-entanglement [TKM05, KMT08]. Some authors have\nalso claimed that problems related to leader election [PSK03, DP06] and distributed consensus [DP06, Hel08] can be solved in distributed systems aided by quantum pre-entanglement.\nThis paper constitutes an attempt to provide a consistent framework for the aforementioned\ndiscussions on distributed computing in a quantum setting. We point out problems with some\nof the work related to distributed computing with pre-entanglement, and propose a completely\ndifferent perspective for future study. Since our intention is to keep the discussion simple, and\n1\n2\n\nSee [Pel99] for an introduction to the CON GE ST model.\nIt stands for Local Operations and Classical Communication.\n\n1\n\n\falso to focus mainly on essential questions of locality in a combinatorial setting, we use as the\nstarting point for all our considerations the well-established LOCAL model a.k.a. Linial's Free\nmodel [Lin87, Lin92].\nOur contribution and outline of the paper. In Section 2 we briefly outline the LOCAL\nmodel and its extensions, obtained by modifying the initialization of the system set-up and/or\nadding quantum communication capabilities on the edges. Whereas this discussion is selfcontained, we also provide a formal mathematical definition of the corresponding notions in\nAppendix A.\nIn Section 3 we compare the computational power of models based on the proposed extensions\nof LOCAL. In particular, we prove that adding quantum extensions to the LOCAL model\ndecreases the round complexity of certain distributed problems. This is achieved through simple\nproof-of-concept examples.\nOn the other hand, in Section 4 we introduce a probabilistic framework for proving lower\nbounds on the distributed time complexity of computational problems in any quantum (or other\nunconventional) models based on LOCAL. This is directly applied to obtain such lower bounds\nfor many combinatorial optimization problems, including Maximal Independent Set, Greedy\nGraph Coloring, and problems of spanner construction. As a side effect, the simple concept of\n\"physical locality\" formulated in this section, leads to the definition of a computational model\nwe call \u03c6-LOCAL, which appears to be of independent interest.\nFinally, in Section 5 we make an attempt to clarify issues with nearly all the related work on\nquantum distributed computing as surveyed by [DP08]. We discuss previous claims of several\nauthors ([PSK03, DP06, Hel08, TKM05, KMT08]) which state that problems such as Leader\nElection or Distributed Consensus benefit from the application of quantum processing. We\nexplain why some of the statements from [PSK03, DP06, Hel08] should be approached with\ncaution.\nSection 6 contains some concluding remarks and suggests directions of future studies.\n\n2\n\nDescription of Computation Models\n\nIn this section we briefly recall the computational properties of the LOCAL model, which\nhas been the subject of intensive study in the last 20 years, starting from the seminal works\nof [Lin87, NS95]. When considering the LOCAL model in the context of quantum processing, it\nhas to be noted that simply introducing a \"quantum computer\" as a module in each processor\ndoes not affect the power of the model, since in LOCAL the processors as such are already\nassumed to have unbounded capabilities of local computation.\nThere exist two distinct and independent approaches to extending the LOCAL model: by\nmodifying the initial set-up of the system (leading to extensions which we call +S and +E), and\nby introducing quantum communication channels (the +Q extension). Of these three extensions,\ntwo (+E and +Q) rely on quantum processing and roughly correspond to settings studied in some\nrelated work [DP08], whereas the third extension (+S) is purely computational in the classical\nsense, and is introduced in this work.\nThe discussion which follows is intentionally informal, whereas rigorous definitions and some\nfurther considerations are postponed to Appendix A. The formalism in the Appendix is used in\n2\n\n\fparticular for showing computational limitations of models and pointing out errors in previous\nwork, hence we keep it precise in a mathematical sense and free from any implicit assumptions.\nThe LOCAL model. It is assumed that the distributed system consists of a set of processors\nV (with |V | = n) and operates in a sequence of synchronous rounds, each of which involves unbounded computations on the local state variables of the processors, and a subsequent exchange\nof messages of arbitrary size between pairs of processors which are connected by links (except\nfor round 0, which involves local computations, only). Nodes can identify their neighbours using\ninteger labels assigned successively to communication ports. The local computation procedures\nencoded in all processors are necessarily the same, and initially all local state variables have the\nsame value for all processors, except for one distinguished local variable x(v) of each processor v\nwhich encodes input data. The input of a problem is defined in the form of a labeled graph Gx ,\nwhere G = (V, E) is the system graph, while x : V \u2192 N is an assignment of labels to processors.\nThe output of the algorithm is given in the form of a vector of local variables y : V \u2192 N, and the\nalgorithm is assumed to terminate once all variables y(v) are definitely fixed. Herein we assume\nthat faults do not appear on processors and links, that local computation procedures may be\nrandomized (with processors having access to their own generators of random variables), and\nthat the input labels x need not in general be unique for all processors.\nIn our considerations, it is convenient to assume that the set of processors V is given before\nthe input is defined. This is used for convenience of notation, and does not affect neither the\nmodel in any way, nor the anonymity of nodes in the considered problems.\nInitialization of the system (+S and +E extensions). In the LOCAL model, it is assumed\nthat the initial set-up of all the processors is identical. This assumption can be relaxed by\nallowing the processors to obtain some information from a central helper, but only before the\nstart of the distributed process (i.e., independently of the input Gx ). The initialization procedure\nis an integral part of the algorithm used for solving the distributed problem. Several different\nforms of initialization can be naturally defined; for clarity of discussion, we consider only two\nextensions of the model: the +S extension (for Separable state), which allows for the most general\nform of initialization possible in a classical computational setting, and the more powerful +E\nextension (for Entangled state), which allows for the most general form of initialization available\nin a quantum distributed system.\nThe +S extension. We say that a computational model is equipped with the +S extension\nif the following modifications are introduced:\n\u2022 For any computational problem, the computational procedure consists of the distributed\nalgorithm applied by all the processors during the rounds of computation, and an additional\n(randomized) procedure executed in a centralized way in the initialization phase. The\nresult of the initialization procedure is an assignment h : V \u2192 N of helper variables to the\nset of processors. The helper variables are independent3 of the input Gx .\n\u2022 For each processor v \u2208 V , at the start of round 0, its input label x(v) is augmented by the\nvalue h(v), stored in a helper register of the local memory.\n3\n\nHelper variables that do depend on the inputs are referred to in the literature as Oracles [FIP06, FGIP07].\nSuch extensions are not discussed in this paper.\n\n3\n\n\fIt is straightforward to show that the above formulation has two equivalent characterizations.\nFrom a computational perspective, we may equivalently say that for each processor v, the helper\ninitialization value h(v) encodes: (1) a unique identifier of v from the range {1, . . . , n}, (2) the\nvalue of n, (3) the value of a random number, chosen from an arbitrarily large range, and shared\nby all processors. All further helper information is unnecessary, since it can be computed by the\nprocessors in round 0 of the distributed computations.\nAlternatively, we may say that through the randomized initialization, according to some\nprobability distribution we choose some deterministic initialization of the set of states of individual processors. This intuition precisely corresponds to the notion of a state with uncertainty\nin classical statistical physics, referred to in quantum-mechanical discussions as a (mixed) separable state of the system. It is obviously true to say that whenever a problem is solved in a model\nwith the +S extension, it may benefit solely from the modification of the system initialization,\nand not from the laws of quantum mechanics.\nThe +E extension. Unlike in classical physics, in quantum mechanics not every initialization of the system has to follow the above pattern. Consider a scenario in which we centrally\ncreate an initial global state of the whole system of processors, and spatially distribute \"parts\"\nof it to the individual processors (for example, by sharing out among the nodes a set of quantumcorrelated photons, coming from a single SPDC4 emission process). Then, each of the processors\ncan perform operations on the \"part\" of the state assigned to its spatial location; by a loose\nanalogy to processing of classical information, this is sometimes referred to as each processor\n\"manipulating its own quantum bits (qubits)\". Given a general initial state of the system,\nthe outcome of such a physical process, as determined by the processors, may display correlations which cannot be described using any classical probabilistic framework. Initial states which\ncan be lead to display such properties are called non-separable, or entangled states. Quantum\nentanglement is without doubt one of the predominant topics studied in quantum-mechanical\nliterature of the last decades; we refer the interested reader to e.g. [NC00] for an extensive\nintroduction to the topic.\nWe say that a computational model is equipped with the +E extension if all processors are\nequipped with helper quantum information registers h, and the computational procedure used\nto solve a problem sets in the initialization phase in a centralized way some chosen, possibly\nentangled, quantum state over the set of quantum information registers h of all processors, in a\nway independent of the input graph Gx .\nOf course, the definition of the +E extension does not require that the starting state is\nentangled; for the special case when it is separable, the +E extension is precisely equivalent to\nthe +S extension.\nCommunication capabilities (+Q extension). Whereas the application of local quantum\noperations in each processor does not increase the power of the LOCAL model as such, the\nsituation changes when the processors can interact with each other using quantum communication channels. Intuitively, such channels allow for the distribution of an entangled state by a\nprocessor over several of its neighbours in one communication round; such an effect cannot be\nachieved using classical communication links.\n4\n\nSpontaneous Parametric Down-Conversion.\n\n4\n\n\fWe say that a computational model is equipped with the +Q extension if all communication\nlinks between processors in the system graph are replaced by quantum communication channels.\nModels based on extensions. Modifications to the initialization and communication capabilities of the system are completely independent of each other. For initialization, we can apply\nno extension, use a separable state (+S), or an entangled state (+E). For communication, we\ncan apply no extension (message exchanges with classical information), or use quantum channels (+Q). Hence, we obtain 6 possible models (LOCAL, LOCAL+S, LOCAL+E, LOCAL+Q,\nLOCAL+Q+S, LOCAL+Q+E), which are discussed in the following section. Some of these collapse onto each other, in particular, LOCAL+Q+E and LOCAL+E are equivalent in terms of\ncomputational power (Proposition 4).\n\n3\n\nHierarchy of Quantum Models\n\nComparing the Power of Computational Models\nIn order to compare the computational power of different models, we introduce two basic notions:\nthat of the problem being solved, and of an outcome of the computational process.\nDefinition 1. A problem P is a mapping Gx 7\u2192 {y i }, which assigns to each input graph Gx a\nset of permissable output vectors y i : V \u2192 N.\nInstead of explicitly saying that we are interested in finding efficient (possibly randomized)\ndistributed algorithms for solving problems within the considered computational models, we\ncharacterize the behavior of such procedures through the probability distribution of output\nvectors which they may lead to, known as an outcome. In fact, such a probability distribution is\nnecessarily well defined, whereas formally describing the computational process may be difficult\nin some unconventional settings (see e.g. the \u03c6-LOCAL model in Section 4).\nDefinition 2. An outcome O is a mapping Gx 7\u2192 {(y i , pi )}, which assigns to each\ngraph\nP input\ni\ni\ni\nGx a normalized discrete probability distribution {p }, such that: \u2200i p > 0 and i p = 1, with\npi representing the probability of obtaining y i : V \u2192 N as the output vector of the distributed\nsystem.\nDefinition 3. For any outcome O in a computational model M which is a variant of LOCAL,\nwe will write O \u2208 M[t] if within model M there exists a distributed procedure which yields\noutcome O after at most t rounds of computation.\nWe will\nPsay that an outcome O is a solution to problem P with probability p if for all Gx ,\nwe have:\n{(y i ,pi )\u2208O(Gx ) : y i \u2208P(Gx )} pi \u2265 p. When p = 1, we will simply call O a solution to\nP (with certainty).\nBy a slight abuse of notation, for a problem P we will write P \u2208 M[t] (respectively,\nP \u2208 M[t, p]) if there exists an outcome O \u2208 M[t] which is a solution to problem P (respectively,\na solution to problem P with probability p).\nFor two computational models M1 , M2 , we say that M1 is not more powerful than M2\n(denoted M1 \u2286 M2 ) if for every problem P, for all t \u2208 N and p > 0, P \u2208 M1 [t, p] =\u21d2 P \u2208\n5\n\n\fFigure 1: Hierarchy of computational extensions to the LOCAL model. See Section 4 for a\ndefinition of the \u03c6-LOCAL model, and Section 2 or Appendix A for definitions of all other\nmodels.\nM2 [t, p]. The relation \u2286 induces a partial order of models which is naturally extended to say\nthat M1 and M2 are equivalent (M1 = M2 ), or that M1 is less powerful than M2 (M1 ( M2 ).\n\nIt can easily be proved that M1 \u2286 M2 if and only if for every outcome O, for all t \u2208 N,\nO \u2208 M1 [t] =\u21d2 O \u2208 M2 [t]. Such an outcome-based characterisation of models is occasionally\nmore intuitive, since it is not explicitly parameterised by probability p.\nIn all further considerations, when proving that M1 ( M2 , we will do so in a stronger,\ndeterministic sense, by showing that there exist a problem P and t \u2208 N such that P \u2208 M2 [t]\nand P \u2208\n/ M1 [t].\n\nRelations Between Quantum Models\nThe most natural variants of LOCAL which are based on the extensions proposed in the previous subsection are the classical model with separable initialization (LOCAL+S), and quantum models with pre-entanglement at initialization, quantum channels, or both (LOCAL+E,\nLOCAL+Q, and LOCAL+Q+E, respectively). The strengths of the models can obviously\nbe ordered as follows: LOCAL \u2286 LOCAL+Q \u2286 LOCAL+Q+S \u2286 LOCAL+Q+E, and\nLOCAL \u2286 LOCAL+S \u2286 LOCAL+E \u2286 LOCAL+Q+E. We now proceed to show that, whereas\nLOCAL+E = LOCAL+Q+E, all the remaining inclusions are in fact strict. The hierarchy of the\nmost important models is shown in Fig. 1.\nProposition 1. LOCAL ( LOCAL+S. Moreover, there exists a problem P such that P \u2208\nLOCAL+S[0] and P 6\u2208 LOCAL[t] for all t \u2208 N.\nProof. Any problem, which can be solved when given unique node identifiers from the range\n{1, . . . , n} is clearly in LOCAL+S[0]. On the other hand, there are many examples of such\nproblems which are not in LOCAL (or require \u03a9(n) rounds assuming that the system graph is\nconnected and node labels are unique), most trivially the problem P of assigning unique node\nidentifiers from the range {1, . . . , n} to all nodes.\nMore interestingly, one can show that LOCAL+S benefits due to the fact that helper variables\nh(v) can encode a value which is set in a randomized way. Consider as a simple example\n6\n\n\fa problem P \u2032 whose input is a graph G = (V, E), of sufficiently large order n, with input\nlabels of the nodes encoding unique node identifiers {1, . . . , n} and the value of n; moreover,\nG is restricted to be the complete graph Kn minus exactly one edge. The goal is to select\nan edge of the graph, i.e., output y must be such that for some two nodes u, v \u2208 V , with\n{u, v} \u2208 E, we have y(u) = y(v) = 1, and for all other w \u2208 V we have y(w) = 0. Even with the\nknowledge of node identifiers and n, in the LOCAL model the problem cannot be solved with\nhigh probability without communication, i.e., within 0 rounds: we have P \u2032 \u2208\n/ LOCAL[0, e\u22121 ]\n(the proof is technical, see Appendix C.1). On the other hand, within the LOCAL+S model\nthis problem admits a solution in 0 rounds with probability arbitrarily close to 1 for sufficiently\nlarge n. Similar arguments can be applied to display the difference between the models for more\nadvanced problems which simulate collaborative mobile agent scenarios, in particular variants\nof the cops-and-robbers problems in graphs.\nWe now point out the difference in power between the classical and quantum models. The\nproofs proceed by rephrasing one of the best established results of quantum interferometry,\nfirst introduced in the context of the so called Bell's Theorem without inequalities, for a 3particle quantum entangled state (cf. [GHZ89] for the original paper, [Mer90] for a very informal\nintuition, or [PCZ+ 08] for a contemporary exposition). We use its more algorithmic modulo-4\nsum formulation, similar to that found in [\u017b08].\nTheorem 2. LOCAL+S ( LOCAL+E. Moreover, there exists a problem P such that P \u2208\nLOCAL+E[0] and P 6\u2208 LOCAL+S[t] for all t \u2208 N.\nProof. Let P be a problem defined on a system with 3 nodes. Let the input graph be empty,\nand assume that input labels x = (x1 , x2 , x3 ) \u2208 {0, 1}3 of respective nodes satisfy the condition\nx1 + x2 + x3 \u2208 {0, 2}. An output y = (y1 , y2 , y3 ) \u2208 {0, 1}3 is considered valid for input x\nif and only if 2(y1 + y2 + y3 ) \u2261 (x1 + x2 + x3 ) mod 4. This problem is not in LOCAL+S,\nsince finding a solution with certainty would imply that there exist three deterministic functions\nY1 , Y2 , Y3 : {0, 1} \u2192 {0, 1}, such that for any input vector (x1 , x2 , x3 ) satisfying the constraints\nof the problem, (Y1 (x1 ), Y2 (x2 ), Y3 (x3 )) is a valid output vector. It is immediate to show that\nthis is impossible, since by considering all of the possible inputs, we obtain the set of equations:\n2(Y1 (0) + Y2 (0) + Y3 (0)) \u2261 0 mod 4, and 2(Y1 (1) + Y2 (1) + Y3 (0)) \u2261 2(Y1 (1) + Y2 (0) + Y3 (1)) \u2261\n2(Y1 (0) + Y2 (1) + Y3 (1)) \u2261 2 mod 4, which is contradictory: by summing the left-hand sides of\nall four equations we obtain 0 \u2261 6 mod 4.\n\nThe situation is different when the system operates in the LOCAL+E model starts in an entangled state. The procedure required to obtain a valid solution is described in detail in [GHZ89].\nIn brief, in the initialization phase we share out to each of the processors one of 3 entangled\nqubits, carried e.g. by photons, which are in the entangled tripartite state known as the GHZ\nstate (namely \u221a12 (|000i + |111i) in Dirac's notation for pure states). Each of the processors then\nperforms a simple transformation on \"its own\" qubit, in a way dependent only on the processor's input xi . Finally, a measurement is performed, and it can be shown that the probability\ndistribution of obtained output vectors (the outcome) is that stated in Table 1. Since all of the\noutputs are accepted as valid for the considered problem P, this implies that P \u2208 LOCAL+E[0].\nWe note that the obtained outcome O \u2208 LOCAL+E[0] is a solution to P with certainty, but\nit is not deterministic, yielding different outputs with probability 1/4 (Table 1); in fact, within\nLOCAL+E there does not exist an outcome which is a solution to P, and yields some output\n7\n\n\fTable 1: An outcome O which is a solution (with certainty) to the modulo-4 sum problem on\nthe 3-node empty graph, and belongs to LOCAL+E[0] (see Theorem 2).\nInput\n(x1 , x2 , x3 )\n\nProbability\npi\n\n(0, 0, 0)\n\n1/4\n1/4\n1/4\n1/4\n\nOutput\n(y1i , y2i , y3i )\n(0,\n(0,\n(1,\n(1,\n\n0,\n1,\n0,\n1,\n\n0)\n1)\n1)\n0)\n\nInput\n(x1 , x2 , x3 )\n\nProbability\npi\n\n(0, 1, 1)\nor (1, 0, 1)\nor (1, 1, 0)\n\n1/4\n1/4\n1/4\n1/4\n\nOutput\n(y1i , y2i , y3i )\n(1,\n(1,\n(0,\n(0,\n\n1,\n0,\n1,\n0,\n\n1)\n0)\n0)\n1)\n\nwith probability 1. This sort of situation could not occur in LOCAL, or in any other classical\nmodel.\nProposition 3. LOCAL ( LOCAL+Q. Moreover, for any t > 0, there exists a problem P\nsuch that P \u2208 LOCAL+Q[t] and P 6\u2208 LOCAL[2t \u2212 1].\nProof. The proof proceeds by a modification of the argument from Theorem 2. This time, we\nconsider a system on n = 3k + 1 nodes, and an input graph with the topology of a uniformly\nsubdivided star with a central node of degree 3. The modified problem P \u2032 consists in solving the\nproblem from Theorem 2, when the three input and output values are put on the three leaves of\nthe star. Within LOCAL, this problem requires 2k rounds to solve, since the three leaves are at\na distance of 2k from each other, and need to communicate to solve the problem. On the other\nhand, in LOCAL+Q we are given quantum communication links. Hence, in round 0, the central\nnode can create an entangled tripartite GHZ state, and propagate its qubits in k rounds5 to the\nleaves of the graph, which then apply the previously discussed quantum procedure.\nWhereas the time distinction between LOCAL+S and LOCAL+E given by Theorem 2 is\nremarkable (since it considers the feasibility of solving problems, or when discussing connected\ngraphs, a speed-up from \u03a9(n) to 0 communication rounds), the situation is less clear between\nLOCAL+Q and LOCAL. Although a speed-up factor of 2 as expressed by Proposition 3 looks\nlike a natural limit, the authors know of no conclusive arguments to show that it cannot be\nincreased further.\nFinally, following the argumentation of [DP08], we note that LOCAL+E = LOCAL+Q+E,\nor in other words that, given access to pre-entanglement, it is possible to simulate quantum\nlinks by means of classical ones. The effect used to achieve this is known as quantum teleportation [PCZ+ 08]; by carefully choosing an entangled state over the whole system, it can be applied\neven when the communicating nodes do not yet know their neighbors' unique identifiers.\nProposition 4 ([DP08]). LOCAL+E = LOCAL+Q+E.\nTo complete a discussion of Fig. 1, we point out that LOCAL+Q is incomparable with\nLOCAL+S. This is because the problem discussed in the proof of Proposition 1 belongs to\nLOCAL+S, but not to LOCAL+Q, and the problem discussed in the proof of Proposition 3\nbelongs to LOCAL+Q[1], but not to LOCAL+S[1].\n5\n\nObserve that intermediate nodes simply send the qubit on, without making any copies.\n\n8\n\n\fThe LOCAL+Q+S model has been left out from discussion, since it appears to be of little significance. By considering the same problems as before, we have LOCAL+Q+S ( LOCAL+Q+E =\nLOCAL+E, so LOCAL+Q+S could be placed directly to the left of LOCAL+E in Fig. 1.\n\n4\n\nLower Time Bounds Based on Physical Locality (\u03c6-LOCAL)\n\nProving lower bounds on the power of quantum models is problematic. This results, in particular,\nfrom the fact that there does not exist as yet an easy-to-use classification of entangled states,\nor of quantum operations (completely positive maps) which can be performed to transform one\nquantum state into another. However, in the context of distributed computing, it is possible\nto consider a more general framework of physical locality, leading to the \u03c6-LOCAL model we\ndefine hereafter, which in turn can be used to bound the power of quantum models.\nWithin the classical LOCAL model, we can say that the output of any processor v after\nt rounds has to be computed based on the input data which can be collected from the input\ngraph Gx by performing an exploration up to a depth of t, starting from node v; we call this\nthe distance-t local view denoted by Vt (Gx , v). This leads to a simple characterisation of the\nLOCAL model in terms of valid outcomes (see Appendix C.2 for a formalization).\n\nIn order to allow for quantum extensions to local, the assumption of classical computability\nneeds to be relaxed, while at the same time retaining in some form the assumption of locality,\nsince it is an essential part of physical theory as we understand it today (cf. e.g. [Shi84, Str07]\nfor different approaches to the problem). To define locality, for a moment we choose to look\nat the system from a physicist's perspective, with the distributed system as an experimental\nstand, with processors as black boxes, with input data Gx as part of the experimental set-up,\nand with output y as the data resulting of a single experiment. For each input, the experiment is\nperformed for an ensemble of identical systems, obtaining a probability distribution of outputs\n{(y i , pi )}. Now, given a round-based model with interactions between nearest neighbors only,\nthe physical understanding of locality is as follows: Locality is violated if and only if, based on the\navailable output data, we can conclusively verify that after t rounds some subset\nS of processors\nS\nwas affected by input data initially localized outside its view Vt (Gx , S) := v\u2208S Vt (Gx , v).\n\nUsing the above intuition, we now formalize this notion to obtain what we call the \u03c6-LOCAL\nmodel, i.e., the weakest possible distributed model which still preserves physical locality. Given\nan output distribution {(y i , pi )} acting on V , for any subset of vertices S \u2286 V we define its\nmarginal distribution on set S, {(y i ,P\npi )}[S], as the unique distribution {(y j , pj )} acting on S\ni\ni\nwhich satisfies the condition pj =\n{i : y j =y i [S]} p , where y [S] is the restriction of output\ni\ny : V \u2192 N to nodes from subset S \u2286 V .\nDefinition 4. An outcome Gx 7\u2192 {(y i , pi )} belongs to \u03c6-LOCAL[t] if for all subsets S \u2286 V ,\n(a)\n(b)\n(a)\n(b)\nfor any pair of inputs Gx , Gx such that Vt (Gx , S) = Vt (Gx , S), the output distributions corresponding to these inputs have identical marginal distributions on set S, i.e.,\n{(y i(a) , pi(a) )}[S] = {(y i(b) , pi(b) )}[S].\nQuantum relaxations of the LOCAL model, whether obtained through application of preentanglement, quantum channels, or both, lie in terms of strength \"in between\" the LOCAL\nand \u03c6-LOCAL model. This is expressed by the following theorem, whose proof we defer to\nAppendix B.\n\n9\n\n\fTheorem 5. LOCAL+Q+E \u2286 \u03c6-LOCAL.\nThe theorem captures the property of locality of nearest-neighbor interactions in quantum\nmechanics, and its proof can be seen as a boundary case (for discrete rounds) of the more\nphysical continuous-time setting studied in [BR81]. It does not rely in any way on any other\nphysical concepts, such as causality or speed of information in the theory of relativity.\nAlthough it is not clear whether the containment in the above theorem is strict (we leave\nthis as an open question), the \u03c6-LOCAL model is still sufficiently constrained to preserve many\nimportant lower time bounds known from the LOCAL model, which are based on arguments\nof indistinguishability of local views of a node for different inputs. In particular, by careful\nanalysis, it is easy to prove the following statements for the \u03c6-LOCAL model.\n\u2022 The\nq problem of finding a maximal independent set in the system graph requires\n\u03a9( logloglogn n ) rounds to solve [KMW04].\n\u2022 The problem of finding a locally minimal (greedy) coloring of the system graph requires\n\u03a9( logloglogn n ) rounds to solve [GKKN07, GKK+ 09].\n\u2022 The problem of finding a connected subgraph with O(n1+1/k ) edges requires \u03a9(k) rounds\nto solve [DGPV08, Elk07].\nThe matter is less clear in the case of the (\u2206 + 1)-coloring problem. The proof of the\nfamous lower bound of 12 log\u2217 n \u2212 O(1) rounds [Lin92] (and its extension to randomized algorithms [Nao91]) does not appear to generalize from the LOCAL model to the \u03c6-LOCAL model;\nwe are unaware of any (even constant) bound on the number of rounds required to find a solution\nto (\u2206 + 1)-coloring in \u03c6-LOCAL. Some indication that the technique of coloring neighborhood\ngraphs, used by Linial, may\n\u0004 \u0005not apply in \u03c6-LOCAL, is that this technique can likewise be used\nto show a lower bound of n2 \u2212 1 rounds on the time required for 2-coloring the cycle Cn , where\nn is even. However, in \u03c6-LOCAL the same problem admits a solution in fewer rounds.\nTheorem 6. The problem of 2-coloring the even cycle Cn (given unique node labels x) belongs\nn\u22122\nto \u03c6-LOCAL[\u2308 n\u22122\n4 \u2309], but does not belong to \u03c6-LOCAL[\u2308 4 \u2309 \u2212 1].\nProof (sketch). For the lower bound, consider the local view of two nodes u, v which still have\ndisjoint views after \u2308 n\u22122\n4 \u2309 \u2212 1 rounds. There are at least two nodes which belong to neither the\nview of u nor the view of v; hence, u and v cannot distinguish whether they are at an even or\nat an odd distance from each other in the cycle. This directly leads to the lower bound, since\nthe definition condition of \u03c6-LOCAL can be shown to be violated for S = {u, v}.\nThe upper bound is generated by on outcome O of the 2-coloring problem, given as follows:\neach of the 2 legal 2-colorings of Cn is used as the output with probability 21 . Such an outcome\nO belongs to \u03c6-LOCAL[\u2308 n\u22122\n4 \u2309]. This can be easily verified, since for any subset S \u2286 V we either\nhave that S consists of exactly two antipodal nodes of Cn , or the view V\u2308 n\u22122 \u2309 (Cnx , S) is simply\n4\nan arc of the cycle.\n\nIt would be interesting to find a constructive quantum procedure for finding a 2-coloring of\nCn in \u2308 n\u22122\n4 \u2309 rounds. In particular, we have that 2-coloring of C6 belongs to \u03c6-LOCAL[1], does\nnot belong to LOCAL+S[1], and do not know if it belongs to LOCAL+E[1].\n10\n\n\f5\n\nSimple Problems in a Quantum Setting\n\nIn this section, we have a look at some of the related work on quantum distributed problems, as\noutlined in the survey [DP08]. Whereas the discussion in this section relies on the results and\nnotation from the preceding sections, it can also be translated into the (not always precisely\ndescribed) computational models studied in the considered related work.\nTwo problems which have been used to exhibit the difference between quantum models and\nnon-quantum models are LeaderElection, where the goal is for exactly one node of the system\ngraph to output a value of 1 whereas all other nodes output 0, and a problem which we will call\nBitPicking, where the goal is for all nodes to return the same output value, either 0 or 1.6 These\ndiscussions include the concept of fairness, which in the terminology of this paper means that we\nare asking not about the problems as such, but about obtaining specific (fair) outcomes. More\nprecisely, we will say that FairLeaderElection is the outcome which puts a uniform probability\ndistribution on the n distinct outputs valid for LeaderElection (i.e., on all possible leaders), and\nFairBitPicking is the outcome which puts a uniform probability distribution on the 2 distinct\noutputs valid for BitPicking (i.e., picking 0 or 1).\nThe focus of [PSK03, DP06, Hel08] is to show that FairBitPicking and FairLeaderElection\nbelong to LOCAL+E[0] (even with some additional restrictions on the amount of allowed preentanglement), whereas they do not belong to LOCAL[0]. This statement is correct, however,\nthis effect is due to the modification of initialization of the system, and not to quantum mechanics.\nIn fact, we can make the following obvious statement.\nProposition 7. FairBitPicking and FairLeaderElection belong to the non-quantum class\nLOCAL+S[0]. Moreover, they can be solved with only one bit of helper information per node, at\ninitialization.\nProof. There is no input for the considered outcomes, hence the initialization procedure can be\ndefined so as to encode the appropriate output vector in the helper data h(v), choosing specific\noutputs according to the required probability distribution.\nConsequently, this sort of study should be considered in the context of the LOCAL+S modification, or in other words, the benefits of adding purely classical helper information to the\nLOCAL model (and not what some authors refer to as \"quantum non-locality\"). Whereas in a\nformal sense it is not a mistake to say that such an effect can also be obtained when using a quantum entangled state as the \"helper\", this is technologically difficult to implement, complicates\nthe discussion, and does not save information in any way, since for the considered outcomes,\nthe required helper data can already be encoded using one bit per node within LOCAL+S.\nAs such, this sort of approach can be seen as useless from the perspective of distributed computing.7 In order to capture the benefit coming from the quantum setup, one has to display\nquantum correlations which cannot be described in the classical framework (Theorem 2 and\nProposition 3).\n6\n\nTwo sets of authors [DP06, Hel08] confuse the latter question with that of the DistributedConsensus problem [Lyn97, AW04].\n7\nSome observations can perhaps be of purely physical interest. For example, for a problem with empty input,\nwhenever there exists a one-bit helper function h : V \u2192 {0, 1} leading to the desired output in LOCAL+S[0],\nunique up to negation of 0 and 1, there will also exist an entangled pure n-qubit state spread over the nodes\nleading to the desired output in LOCAL+E[0], unique up to transformation of the local basis {|0i, |1i}. [DP06]\nnote that this is the case for FairBitPicking and FairLeaderElection.\n\n11\n\n\fAs a side note, we mention that a separate question concerns the anonymity of nodes in the\nsystem. Whereas it is impossible to solve leader election with certainty in the classical anonymous setting, [TKM05, KMT08] have considered leader election in the anonymous quantum\nsetting of LOCAL+Q, providing a nice and efficient algorithm, which obtains a valid solution\nwith certainty.\nTheorem 8 ([TKM05, KMT08]). LeaderElection \u2208 LOCAL+Q[n], for anonymous nodes.\nFinally, we relate to the recent claims that the DistributedConsensus can be solved in a\nquantum setting without communication. Whereas these claims result from a misunderstanding\nof the definition [Lyn97, AW04] of DistributedConsensus, we point out that such a result is\nimpossible in any quantum model, since it is even impossible in \u03c6-LOCAL. We recall that in\nDistributedConsensus, given an assignment of input labels (x1 , . . . , xn ) to particular processors,\nthe goal is to obtain an output vector (y, . . . , y), such that y \u2208 {x1 , . . . , xn }.\nProposition 9. DistributedConsensus \u2208\n/ \u03c6-LOCAL[0].\nProof. Consider a system with only two processors, having inputs x1 , x2 \u2208 {0, 1}. Let outcome\nO be a valid solution to DistributedConsensus with certainty. Then, O must be given as the\nfollowing mapping x 7\u2192 {(pi , y i )} for some probability values p, q \u2208 [0, 1]: (0, 0) 7\u2192 {(1, (0, 0))},\n(1, 1) 7\u2192 {(1, (1, 1))}, (0, 1) 7\u2192 {(p, (0, 0)), (1 \u2212 p, (1, 1))}, and (1, 0) 7\u2192 {(q, (0, 0)), (1 \u2212 q, (1, 1))}.\nNow, suppose that O \u2208 \u03c6-LOCAL[0]. Applying the definition of \u03c6-LOCAL to set S consisting\nof processor 1 only, considering inputs xa = (0, 0) and xb = (0, 1), we obtain p = 1. Likewise,\napplying the same definition to set S \u2032 consisting of processor 2 only, considering inputs x\u2032a = (1, 1)\nand x\u2032b = (0, 1), we obtain p = 0, a contradiction.\n\n6\n\nConclusions and Future Work\n\nWe have pointed out that the computational power of quantum variants of the LOCAL model is\nstrictly greater than that of the classical LOCAL model, or that of the LOCAL model equipped\nwith helper information such as a pool of shared random bits. It remains to be seen whether a\ndifference can be observed for any problems of practical significance. It is potentially possible\nthat certain combinatorial optimization problems may benefit from quantum extensions to the\nLOCAL model. However, we can say that the \"view-based\" limitations of the LOCAL model\nstill hold in quantum models. So, one specific question which remains open is whether the\n(\u2206 + 1)-Coloring problem can be solved in a constant number of rounds in any of the relaxed\nvariants of LOCAL.\n\nFinally, we can ask about a characterization of the limitations of quantum computability,\nthe most natural question being to establish whether the containment LOCAL+E \u2286 \u03c6-LOCAL\nis strict. As a matter of fact, further studies of the \u03c6-LOCAL model, which can be seen as the\nweakest distributed local model, capturing verifiability rather than computability of outcomes,\nappear to be of interest in their own right.\nAcknowledgment: We gratefully thank Pierre Fraigniaud and Zvi Lotker for their preliminary discussions on the EPR effect and its applicability to Distributed Computing.

There is a duality between these two concepts: we can also say that the state\nof the system is uniquely described through the distribution of outcomes of measurements on all\npossible observables related to it. Whereas in quantum-informational papers it is often convenient to focus on states, we choose to adopt the approach more usual in mathematical physics,\nwhich focuses on operator algebras (observables are operators satisfying certain mathematical\nconditions). The algebraic approach used as the basis of this model is generally accepted as the\nmost mathematically robust theory, and moreover it naturally encodes concepts of quantummechanical locality, since operator algebras are spatially localised (restricted to each processor),\nunlike the state which is a global property of the system of all processors.\nMost of the considerations in this paper can be without much loss of generality viewed\nas finite-dimensional. Then, a (unital) C \u2217 -algebra can be introduced simply as some set of\nm \u00d7 m matrices over complex numbers, which contains the identity matrix, and is closed with\nrespect to the operations of matrix multiplication, matrix conjugation, and linear combination.\nFurther on we rely only on a few basic concepts which can be understood in accordance with\ntheir standard definition for matrices, such as matrix multiplication, the tensor product \u2297, and\nspectral decomposition. The interested reader is referred to [BR79] for an explanation of more\nadvanced concepts related to C \u2217 -algebras.\n\nA.1\n\nSpecification of the Physical System\n\nThe distributed set-up is given by a recipe which is well defined for each n \u2208 N. For simplicity\nof the description, we assume that all the processors know a value D, which is some arbitrarily\nweak upper bound on the number of neighbours of the node in the system, and that we consider\nproblems for which the input and output values are integers also bounded by D, i.e., x, y : V \u2192\n{0, . . . , D}.\n\u2022 Each processor v is described by its own copy Av of a C \u2217 -algebra A, localised in an area\nassociated with the processor.\n\u2022 The algebra A describing a processor is a complex system composed of the processor's\nseveral modules, given in the form of the following tensor product of C \u2217 -algebras: Av =\nQ \u2297 IO1 \u2297 * * * \u2297 IOD , where:\n\u2013 Q is a non-commutative (quantum) algebra encoding the computational characteristics (\"hardware\") of the processor,\n\u2013 IO1 , . . . , IOD are isomorphic copies of an algebra IO representing a single input/output communication port of the processor (the algebra IO is commutative\nif and only if the channel is classical, and non-commutative if and only if the channel\nis a quantum one).\n\u2022 The multi-processor environment as a whole is described by the tensor product algebra of\nthe algebras of specific processors, A\u2297 = A1 \u2297 * * * \u2297 An .\niv\n\n\f\u2022 The state of the multi-processor system is a positive normalized linear functional acting\non algebra A\u2297 , of the form \u03c9 : A\u2297 \u2192 R+ . The state \u03c9 is defined at the time of the initial\nset-up of the distributed system, and can be used to encode pre-entanglement.\n\u2022 The input data of processors, given by way of a function x : V \u2192 {0, . . . , D}, is fixed\nand for simplicity assumed to be outside the quantum system. The algorithm is defined\nby way of a family of quantum operations (completely positive maps), \u03c6x : A \u2192 A, for\n0 \u2264 x \u2264 D, which encode the local operation of a processor having x as its input value.\n\u2022 The evolution (dynamics) of the system is given through a sequence of discrete rounds.\nThe t-th round is subdivided into a phase in which some local transformations \u03c6v are\napplied within each processor (computation phase), and a phase used for exchanging\nmessages \u03c8e along edges e between adjacent processors (communication phase). For\n\u2297\nan observable A\u2297 , initially we put A\u2297\n(0) = \u03c61 * * * \u03c6n A , and for all subsequent rounds,\n\u2297\nA\u2297\n(t+1) = \u03c61 * * * \u03c6n \u03c81 * * * \u03c8m A(t) . The specific maps \u03c6v and \u03c8e are formally defined as\nfollows.\n\n\u2013 Dynamic maps \u03c6v : A\u2297 \u2192 A\u2297 describe local operations performed during a round t\nat each node. The map \u03c6v acts only on the local algebra of processor v depending on\nits input label x(v), and is given by extension to the tensor product of the following\ntransformation: \u03c6v (A1 \u2297 * * * \u2297 Av \u2297 * * * \u2297 An ) = A1 \u2297 * * * \u2297 \u03c6x(v) (Av ) \u2297 * * * \u2297 An . In\neach round t, all maps \u03c6v corresponding to different processors act on independent\nalgebras and clearly commute (i.e., they can be executed simultaneously or reordered\nwithout changing the result).\n\u2013 Dynamic maps \u03c8e : A\u2297 \u2192 A\u2297 describe communication along edges e of the system\ngraph, and at the same time define the system graph. All the maps are induced\nby extension to the tensor product of the same transmission function for a pair of\ninput/output ports \u03c8 : IO \u00d7 IO \u2192 IO \u00d7 IO, given simply as the exchange operation\n\u03c8(X, Y ) = (Y, X) if edge e exists in the graph, and the identity operation \u03c8(X, Y ) =\n(X, Y ) otherwise (signifying lack of communication). The map \u03c8e acts only on the the\nalgebras corresponding to copies of IO for the input/output ports of the processors\ncommunicating along edge e, leaving all other algebras unchanged. The maps \u03c8e for\ndifferent edges act on independent algebras and clearly commute (i.e., they can be\nexecuted simultaneously or reordered without changing the result).\n\u2022 The local algebra A of a processor contains one distinguished element: observable M \u2208 A,\nwhich is used for purposes of measurement. For P\nsimplicity we assume that M has a\ndiscrete spectral decomposition of the form M = ki=1 \u03bbi P i , with eigenvalues \u03bbi \u2208 R+\nand projectors P i \u2208 A. The observable M \u2297 \u2208 A\u2297 is given through the tensor products of\nparticular processors' copies of observable M , as M \u2297 = M \u2297 * * * \u2297 M .\n\u2022 The evolution of the system is assumed to terminate after T rounds. After T rounds, a\n\u2297\nstandard von Neumann measurement process is applied to observable M(T\n) = [M \u2297 * * * \u2297\n\u2297\nM ](T ) (the evolved observable M after T rounds). This can be described as follows:\nby iterating over all possible tuples of values (i1 , . . . , in ) \u2208 {1, . . . , k}n for all v, with\nprobability p(i1 ,...,in ) = \u03c9([P i1 \u2297 * * * \u2297 P in ](T ) ), the values (\u03bbi1 , . . . , \u03bbin ) are selected as the\nresult of measurement for the respective processors (1, . . . , n). The probabilities p(i1 ,...,in )\nare understood here in the classical sense, and normalized in sum to 1.\nv\n\n\f\u2022 The output of the algorithm is obtained by applying a function f : R+ \u2192 {0, . . . , D}\nto the measurement results. Thus, values (f (\u03bbi1 ), . . . , f (\u03bbin )) are returned by processors\n(1, . . . , n), respectively.\nSuch a set-up is chosen for its simplicity, but obviously, there exist several other definitions\nwhich lead to equivalent models. For example, the input can be represented by enlarging the\nalgebras Q and introducing an additional factored part of the input state. Also, for improved\nclarity of the model, we prefer to consider dynamic maps, deferring other quantum operations\n(such as measurements) to the final stage of the algorithm. This can be achieved without loss\nof generality by sufficiently enlarging the local algebras of the processors (see e.g. [Str07] for a\nhigh-level exposition). When defining algorithms in practice it may of course be convenient to\napply measurements in intermediate steps so as to simplify formulation.\nIn what follows, we introduce some standard notation. A state \u03c9 is called pure if it is\nextremal with respect to convex combination of states (i.e., if \u03c9 = \u03b1\u03c91 + (1 \u2212 \u03b1)\u03c92 for some\nstates \u03c91 6= \u03c92 and 0 \u2264 \u03b1 < 1, then \u03b1 = 0). A pure state \u03c9 is said to be a product state over\nAa \u2297 Ab if for any A \u2208 Aa , B \u2208 Ab we have \u03c9(A \u2297 B) = \u03c9(A \u2297 1)\u03c9(1 \u2297 B) \u2261 \u03c9a (A)\u03c9b (B); for\ncompactness, we simply write \u03c9 = \u03c9a \u03c9b .\n\nA.2\n\nDetails of the Computational Model\n\nFrom a computational perspective, the set-up of the system described in the previous section\ncan be summarized as follows:\n\u2022 The distributed algorithm (\u03c9, {\u03c6x }, Q, IO, M, f ) is defined by setting the initial state \u03c9\nof the system, the maps \u03c6x which shape the local computations in each round, and the\nobservable M and function f responsible for extracting the output from the quantum\nsystem. The algebras Q and IO which define the \"hardware\" of the processors can be\nincluded in the specification of the algorithm, or can be taken as the general operator\nalgebra B(H) over a Hilbert space.\n\u2022 The input is provided by setting the edges of the system graph and the inputs x(v) of\nspecific nodes; these settings directly influence the maps \u03c8e and \u03c6v which are responsible\nfor communication and local computations within the system, respectively.\nDefinition 5. The above described model of a physical system provides a formal characterization of quantum extensions to the LOCAL model.\n\u2022 When no restrictions are made about the state \u03c9, the model is said to be equipped with\nthe +E extension.\nWhen state \u03c9 is restricted\nto be a mixed state separable over the local algebrasPA, i.e., a\nP\nstate of the form i pi (\u03c91i * * * \u03c9ni ), for some values of probabilities pi , pi \u2265 0, i pi = 1,\nand some local pure states \u03c9ni over algebra A, possibly different for each processor, then\nthe model is said to be equipped with the +S extension.\n\nWhen state \u03c9 is restricted to be of the form \u03c9l . . . \u03c9l , for some pure state \u03c9l over algebra\nA, identical for each processor, the system has neither of these extensions.\n\n\u2022 When no restrictions are made about the communication algebra IO, which may be noncommutative, the system is said to be equipped with the +Q extension.\nvi\n\n\fWhen algebra IO is restricted to be commutative, communication is understood in the\nclassical sense and the system has no such extension.\nNote that the above definition also characterizes the LOCAL and LOCAL+S models. The\nfact that such a characterisation is equivalent to the computational definition (Section 2) is\nstraightforward to prove, taking into account that the considered initial states are separable,\nand the proposed evolution cannot create entanglement since only classical algebras are applied\nfor interaction between processors (cf. [Bae87] and [Nie99] for different expositions of related\nconcepts). The evolution on separable states is then easily simulated by a stochastic process, or\nequivalently, a distributed randomized algorithm.\n\nB\n\nProof of Theorem: LOCAL+Q+E \u2286 \u03c6-LOCAL\n\nProof. Consider any quantum distributed algorithm (\u03c9, {\u03c6x }, Q, IO, M, f ). For any subset of\nprocessors S \u2286 V , we will denote by A\u2297S the tensor product of algebras A, taken over processors\nfrom set S, only. Consider the effect of the evolution maps {\u03c6v } and {\u03c8e } on an arbitrary\noperator AS \u2208 A\u2297S . It is clear that AS is not affected by \u03c6v if v \u2208\n/ S, and moreover AS is not\naffected by \u03c8e if e \u2208\n/ V1 (S). Thus, since these maps encode the input graph Gx , after a single\nround of evolution we may write [AS ](1) = \u03c41 (AS , V1 (Gx , S)), where \u03c41 denotes some operation\ndependent only on the algorithm (independent of Gx ). Moreover, since maps \u03c6v are local and\nmaps \u03c8e only act on nearest neighbours, we have [AS ](1) \u2208 A\u2297V1 (S) . By applying the evolution\nprocedure for t rounds, we immediately obtain by induction that [AS ](t) = \u03c4t (AS , Vt (Gx , S)),\nwhere \u03c4t denotes some operation dependent only on the algorithm. Since the above holds for any\noperator AS \u2208 A\u2297S , distributions of results of all measurements restricted to set of processors\nS are independent of the input graph Gx , except for the local view Vt (Gx , S). This immediately\nimplies that all solutions which belong to LOCAL+Q+E[t] also belong to \u03c6-LOCAL[t].\n\nC\nC.1\n\nSupplementary Propositions\nProperties of problem P \u2032 (selecting an edge of Kn \\ {e})\n\nProposition 10. Problem P \u2032 \u2208\n/ LOCAL[0, e\u22121 ].\nProof. Consider an outcome O in LOCAL[0] which solves P \u2032 with some probability \u03a0. Within\nLOCAL[0], the output value yi \u2208 {0, 1} of each node i is dependent only on the input label\nof the node, hence we may assume that with some probability pi node i returns 0, and with\nprobability 1 \u2212 pi returns 1. From now on we will only consider the nodes which return 1 with\nnon-zero probability, i.e. pi < 1; w.l.o.g. let us suppose that this is the set of nodes {1, . . . , k},\nfor some k, 2 \u2264 k \u2264 n. W.l.o.g. we can assume that p1 \u2264 p2 \u2264 . . . \u2264 pk . It is straightforward to\nsee that the worst-case input Gx for such a procedure is a graph with a missing edge between\nnodes 1 and 2. Hence, we can consider a simple application of Bernoulli's formula for a sequence\nof k independent random trials (1, . . . , k) with failure probabilities (p1 , . . . , pk ), in which the\n\"winning event\" is the success of exactly two trials, different from the pair {1, 2}. Denoting\n\nvii\n\n\f8\nqi = p\u22121\ni \u2212 1, we have :\n\n\u03a0 = p1 * * * pk *\n\n\u0010\n\nX\n\n\u0011\nqi qj \u2212 q1 q2 .\n\n(1)\n\n1\u2264i<j\u2264k\n\nIt now suffices to prove that the above expression, treated as a multi-variable function with\nrespect to k and {p1 , . . . , pk }, subject to the constraints k \u2208 {2, . . . , n}, 0 \u2264 p1 \u2264 p2 \u2264 . . . \u2264\npk < 1, does not achieve a value \u03a0 \u2265 e\u22121 . This is a technical step which, for the sake of\ncompleteness, we perform below.\nFirst, by directly solving a multi-variable optimization problem for small values of k, we\nestablish that \u03a0 < e\u22121 \u2248 0.36 for all k \u2264 5. Indeed, when k = 2 we verify that \u03a0 = 0,\n8\n8\n< 0.30 (and \u03a0 = 27\nis attained when p1 = p2 = p3 = 31 ); when\nwhen k = 3, \u03a0 \u2264 27\n5\n5\nk = 4, \u03a0 \u2264 16\n< 0.32 (and \u03a0 = 16\nis attained when p1 = p2 = p3 = p4 = 12 ), when k = 5,\n3 4\n3 4\n\u03a0 \u2264 ( 4 ) < 0.32 (and \u03a0 = ( 4 ) is attained when p1 = 0 and p2 = p3 = p4 = p5 = 34 ).\nNow, let k \u2265 6; we will show that it suffices to consider the case when p2 = p3 = . . . pk\u22121 .\nSuppose, to the contrary, that pk\u22121 > p2 and that \u03a0 \u2265 e\u22121 ; we will construct an outcome O \u2032\ncorresponding to some k\u2032 and some set of probabilities {p\u20321 , . . . , p\u2032k }, such that either |{i : p\u2032i =\np\u20322 }| > |{i : pi = p2 }| or k\u2032 < k, and O \u2032 yields a correct solution with probability \u03a0\u2032 \u2265 \u03a0. To\nachieve this, we put: k\u2032 = k, p\u2032i = pi for all i < k \u2212 1, p\u2032k\u22121 = max{p2 , pk\u22121 pk } < pk\u22121 , and\np\npk\np\u2032k = k\u22121\n> pk (note that either p\u2032k\u22121 = p2 , or else p\u2032k = 1; in the latter case, we set k\u2032 = k \u22121).\np\u2032\nk\u22121\n\nFor convenience of notation we do not sort the values p\u2032i in non-decreasing order with respect\nto i, but note that we still have p\u20321 \u2264 p\u20322 \u2264 p\u20323 , . . . , p\u2032k , so \u03a0\u2032 is given by an expression analogous\nto (1). We now introduce some auxiliary notation. For any subset of nodes S \u2286 {1, . . . , k} with\n|S| \u2265 2, let s0 , s1 , and s2 be the probabilities that exactly 0, 1, and 2 of the nodes from S,\nrespectively, return a value of 1 in O (s\u20320 , s\u20321 , and s\u20322 are likewise definedPfor O \u2032 ; we also extend\nthis notation to letters x for set X, and y for set Y ). Denoting \u03b3(S,w) = i\u2208S qiw , for w \u2208 {1, 2},\nwe recall the following simple relations:\nY\npi\ns0 =\ni\u2208S\n\ns1 =\n\nY\n\npi *\n\nY\n\npi *\n\ni\u2208S\n\ns2 =\n\ni\u2208S\n\nX\n\nqi = s0 \u03b3(S,1)\n\ni\u2208S\n\nX\n\ns2\n1\n2\n\u2212 \u03b3(S,2) ) \u2264 1\nqi qj = s0 (\u03b3(S,1)\n2\n2s0\n\n(2)\n\ni,j\u2208S, i<j\n\ns0 + s1 + s2 \u2264 1\nNow, let X = {1, . . . , k \u2212 2} and Y = {k \u2212 1, k}. By introducing the above relations into\nformula (1), we obtain for outcome O:\n\u03a0 = x0 y2 + x1 y1 + (x2 \u2212 x0 q1 q2 )y0 .\n\n(3)\n\nWhen writing an analogous expression for O \u2032 , we observe that x\u20320 = x0 , x\u20321 = x1 , x\u20322 = x2 ,\ny0\u2032 = y0 , q1\u2032 = q1 , and q2\u2032 = q2 , hence:\n\u03a0\u2032 = x0 y2\u2032 + x1 y1\u2032 + (x2 \u2212 x0 q1 q2 )y0 .\nBy subtracting the above expressions we obtain and noting that y1 \u2212 y1\u2032 = \u2212(y2 \u2212 y2\u2032 ), we obtain:\n\u03a0\u2032 \u2212 \u03a0 = (x1 \u2212 x0 )(y1\u2032 \u2212 y1 ).\n\n8\n\nWhen pi = 0, all subsequent expressions are well defined through their limit values when pi \u2192 0+ .\n\nviii\n\n\fWe have that y1\u2032 \u2212 y1 > 0 (because pk\u22121 pk = p\u2032k\u22121 p\u2032k , p\u2032k\u22121 < pk\u22121 , and p\u2032k > pk ). Consequently,\nif x1 \u2265 x0 , then \u03a0\u2032 \u2265 \u03a0. We will now prove that the opposite case, i.e. x1 < x0 is impossible.\nIndeed, supposing that x1 < x0 , consider the maximum possible value of y0 , subject to the\nfollowing constraints on probabilities x0 , x1 , x2 , y0 , y1 , y2 which are then necessarily fulfilled:\ny0 + y1 + y2 = 1, x0 + x1 + x2 \u2264 1, x1 \u2264 x0 , x2 \u2264 12 x1 (by (2)), x0 y2 + x1 y1 + x2 y0 \u2265 e\u22121 (since\nthe left-hand side is an upper bound on \u03a0 by (3), and moreover \u03a0 \u2265 e\u22121 by assumption). By\nsolving this optimization problem, we obtain y0 \u2264 1\u2212e\u22121 (with equality obtained \u221a\nfor x0 = 1 and\nx1 = x2 = y1 = 0). Hence, since y0 = pk\u22121 pk , and pk\u22121 \u2264 pk , we have pk\u22121 \u2264 1 \u2212 e\u22121 < 54 .\nx1\n1\nConsequently, for all i \u2264 k \u2212 2, pi \u2264 pk\u22121 < 45 , and qi = p\u22121\ni \u2212 1 > 4 . But then: x0 = \u03b3(X,1) =\nq1 + . . . + qk\u22122 > 41 (k \u2212 2) \u2265 1, a contradiction with the assumption x1 < x0 .\n\nThus, it only remains to solve the case when k \u2265 6 and p2 = p3 = . . . pk\u22121 . But then by\ndeveloping expression (1), we have:\n\u0001\n2\n\u03a0 = p2k\u22124 [(1\u2212p1 )(1\u2212pk )p22 +(k\u22123)*(1\u2212p1 )(1\u2212p2 )p2 pk +(k\u22122)*(1\u2212pk )(1\u2212p2 )p1 p2 + k\u22122\n2 (1\u2212p2 ) p1 pk ].\n\nThis expression involves only four variables, subject to the constraints: k \u2208 {6, 7, . . . , n} and\n0 \u2264 p1 \u2264 p2 \u2264 pk \u2264 1, and by solving this problem we indeed verify that always \u03a0 < e\u22121 , which\ncompletes the proof.\n\nWe remark that the optimal assignment of probabilities to nodes is as follows: for n = 3 or\nn = 4, we put the uniform distribution, pi = n\u22122\nn . For n \u2265 5, we always select 1 as the output\nn\u22122\nfor node 1 (p1 = 0), and put pi = n\u22121\nfor 2 \u2264 i \u2264 n. As n tends to infinity, the probability\nthat the obtained output is correct tends to e\u22121 from below. Clearly, in order to obtain such a\nsolution, the nodes must take advantage of their input labels which contain information about\nthe identifiers and n.\nProposition 11. Problem P \u2032 \u2208 LOCAL+S[0, 1 \u2212 O(1/N 2 )], when considering graphs of order\nn \u2265 N.\nProof. It suffices to observe that the helper variable h(v) can simply encode the output, and be\nset in a randomized way so as to select all edges of the complete graph with\n\u0001 equal probability.\nFor any input, the probability that the solution is correct is then 1 \u2212 1/ n2 .\n\nC.2\n\nCharacterization of the LOCAL Model through Feasible Outcomes\n\nFor deterministic algorithms in LOCAL, the output of any processor v after t rounds is a\ndeterministic function of the identifiers of nodes which are located within its view Vt (Gx , v).\nClaim 12. An outcome Gx 7\u2192 {(y i , pi )} can be deterministically obtained in t rounds in the\nLOCAL model if and only if p1 = 1 and there exists a function f such that, for every node v,\ny 1 (v) = f (Vt (Gx , v)).\nAllowing for randomised algorithms slightly increases the power of the model. The usual\nscenario is to allow each node v to flip coins during the execution of the algorithm, which is in\nfact equivalent to picking an arbitrary (possibly large) random positive integer r(v) by each node\nbefore the start of execution [Lin92]. Outcomes in the LOCAL model can thus be described by\ncounting the number of random integer assignments leading to a particular output vector.\nClaim 13. An outcome Gx 7\u2192 {(y i , pi )} belongs to LOCAL[t] if and only if there exists a\nfunction f such that for some integer k we have pi = k1n |{r \u2208 {1, . . . , k}V : \u2200v \u2208 V, y i (v) =\nf (Vt (G(x,r) , v))}|.\nix\n\n\f"}
