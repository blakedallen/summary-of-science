E. Hirsch\n\narXiv:0810.5127v1 [cond-mat.supr-con] 28 Oct 2008\n\nDepartment of Physics, University of California, San Diego\nLa Jolla, CA 92093-0319\nSuperconductivity occurs in systems that have a lot of negative charge: the highly negatively\ncharged (CuO2 )= planes in the cuprates, negatively charged (F eAs)\u2212 planes in the iron arsenides,\nand negatively charged B \u2212 planes in magnesium diboride. And, in the nearly filled (with negative\nelectrons) bands of almost all superconductors, as evidenced by their positive Hall coefficient in the\nnormal state. No explanation for this charge asymmetry is provided by the conventional theory of\nsuperconductivity, within which the sign of electric charge plays no role. Instead, the sign of the\ncharge carriers plays a key role in the theory of hole superconductivity, according to which metals\nbecome superconducting because they are driven to expel negative charge (electrons) from their interior. This is why NIS tunneling spectra are asymmetric, with larger current for negatively biased\nsamples. The theory also offers a compelling explanation of the Meissner effect: as electrons are\nexpelled towards the surface in the presence of a magnetic field, the Lorentz force imparts them with\nazimuthal velocity, thus generating the surface Meissner current that screens the interior magnetic\nfield. In type II superconductors, the Lorentz force acting on expelled electrons that don't reach\nthe surface gives rise to the azimuthal velocity of the vortex currents. In the absence of applied\nmagnetic field, expelled electrons still acquire azimuthal velocity, due to the spin-orbit interaction,\nin opposite direction for spin-up and spin-down electrons: the \"Spin Meissner effect\". This results\nin a macroscopic spin current flowing near the surface of superconductors in the absence of applied\nfields, of magnitude equal to the critical charge current (in appropriate units). Charge expulsion also\ngives rise to an interior outward-pointing electric field and to excess negative charge near the surface. In strongly type II superconductors this physics should give rise to charge inhomogeneity and\nspin currents throughout the interior of the superconductor, to large sensitivity to (non-magnetic)\ndisorder and to a strong tendency to phase separation.\nPACS numbers:\n\nI.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nIn a perfectly conducting fluid, magnetic field lines\nmove with the fluid (Alfven's theorem[1]). Thus it is\nnatural to infer that the expulsion of magnetic field\nlines from the interior of a metal making a transition\nto the superconducting state (Meissner effect[2]) is likely\nto be associated with radially outward motion of electric\ncharge[3]. However, the conventional theory of superconductivity predicts no radial motion of charge in the\ntransition to superconductivity[4]. Rather, BCS-London\ntheory postulates that a spontaneous azimuthal charge\nmotion near the surface is generated (Meissner current)\nto compensate the magnetic field in the interior, without\nhowever explaining what is the driving force for such a\nmotion nor how angular momentum is conserved[5].\nInstead, the theory of hole superconductivity[6] predicts that superconductors expel negative charge from\ntheir interior towards the surface as they enter the superconducting state[7, 8] to lower their kinetic energy[9]\nassociated with quantum confinement[10], whether or\nnot an external magnetic field is present. In the presence of an external magnetic field, the radial charge motion will 'drag' the magnetic field lines with it as in\na classical plasma[1]: the magnetic Lorentz force on a\nradially moving charge acts in the azimuthal direction,\nand the deflected electron motion generates a magnetic\nfield in direction opposite to the applied one. Thus, the\ntheory offers a 'dynamical' explanation of the Meissner\n\neffect[11]. In the absence of applied magnetic field, the\nradial outflow of charge gives rise to a spontaneous spin\ncurrent[12], predicted to exist in the ground state of all\nsuperconductors[13].\nThe hypothesis that the transition to superconductivity is associated with expulsion of negative charge is\nsupported by the observation that high temperature superconductivity appears to be favored in materials with\nsubstructures that have excess negative charge, namely\nthe (CuO2 )= planes in the cuprates, the (F eAs)\u2212 planes\nin the iron arsenides, and the B \u2212 planes in magnesium diboride. The observation that in high Tc materials normal-insulator-superconductor tunneling spectra\nare asymmetric, with larger current for a negatively biased sample[14, 15], is further evidence that superconductors have a tendency to expel negative charge. Finally, superconducting materials almost always exhibit a\npositive Hall coefficient in the normal state[16], which\nindicates electronic bands almost full with negative electrons.\nSuperconductivity arises in our theory when the Fermi\nlevel is close to the top of a band[17], and Tc is enhanced\nwhen the ions are negatively charged[18]. Electronhole asymmetric electronic polaron models describe the\nphysics of pair formation[19], which in the low energy sector reduce to a Hubbard model with correlated\nhopping[20]. The pair (bipolaron) is lighter than the single polaron in these models[21] because the hopping amplitude increases with increasing local hole occupation\n\n\f2\ndue to electron-hole asymmetry[22], and this effect promotes pairing of hole carriers[20]. The models are derived from basic atomic physics considerations of wide\ngenerality[22], and the theory is proposed to apply to all\nsuperconducting materials[23].\nII.\n\nTHE TWO ROUTES TO THE MEISSNER\nEFFECT\n\nThe fact that the Meissner effect is unexplained by\nthe conventional theory is not generally recognized[11].\nThe canonical momentum of an electron with superfluid\nvelocity ~vs is\ne~\np = me~vs + A\n~\nc\n\n(1)\n\n~ the magnetic vector potential. In the BCS ground\nwith A\nstate the expectation value < p~ >= 0, hence the superfluid velocity is given by\n~vs = \u2212\n\ne\u03bbL ~\ne ~\nA=\u2212\nB \u00d7 n\u0302\nme c\nme c\n\n(2)\n\nThe second equality in Eq. (2) applies to a cylindrical\ngeometry, where n\u0302 is the outward pointing normal of the\n~ is the magnetic field\nlateral surface of the cylinder and B\nalong the axis of the cylinder. The London penetration\ndepth \u03bbL is given by[4]\n4\u03c0ns e2\n1\n=\n\u03bb2L\nme c2\n\n(3)\n\nwhere ns is the superfluid density.\nEq. (2) embodies the Meissner effect[4]. However the\nBCS 'explanation' just outlined does not explain how the\nelectrons are driven to acquire this velocity starting from\na normal state where the average velocity is zero in the\npresence of a static magnetic field, nor how the mechanical angular momentum of the carriers of the Meissner\ncurrent is compensated[11].\nA.\n\nMeissner current from orbit expansion\n\nd~v\ne\n~ + F~r\n= ~v \u00d7 B\ndt\nc\n\n(4)\n\nwhere the first term is the magnetic Lorentz force and\nthe second term is a radial force arising from \"quantum\npressure\" that drives the electron outward[10]. From Eq.\n(4),\n~r \u00d7\n\nd~v\ne\n~\n=\n~r \u00d7 (~v \u00d7 B)\ndt\nme c\n\n~ and the acquired azso that ~r \u00d7 ~v = \u2212(e/2me c)r2 B,\nimuthal velocity in moving out a distance r is\ne\nrB\n(7)\nv\u03c6 = \u2212\n2me c\nThus, to acquire the azimuthal speed Eq. (2) needed for\nthe Meissner current requires the action of the Lorentz\nforce over a radially outgoing motion to radius r = 2\u03bbL .\nB.\n\nMeissner current from Faraday induction\n\nFor an electron orbiting in a circular orbit of radius r,\nas an external magnetic field perpendicular to the orbit\nis applied, an azimuthal electric field E = (r/2c)\u2202B/\u2202t\nis generated by Faraday's law, and the velocity of the\nelectron changes as\ndv\ner \u2202B\neE\n=\n=\ndt\nme\n2me c \u2202t\n\n(5)\n\n(8)\n\nso that for a magnetic field increasing from 0 to B the\nextra velocity acquired is\ner\n\u2206v =\nB\n(9)\n2me c\nwhich reduces to Eq. (2) if and only if the orbit has radius\nr = 2\u03bbL . Hence, the hallmark property of superconductors, that the same Meissner current Eq. (2) results when\na magnetic field is applied to an already superconducting\nmetal or when a normal metal becomes superconducting\nin a pre-existent magnetic field, can be understood from\nthe assumption that superconducting electrons reside in\nmesoscopic orbits of radius 2\u03bbL . A parallel reasoning\nleads to the development of a ground state spin current\nin the absence of applied fields[13] (Spin Meissner effect)\nas we discuss in the following section.\nIII.\n\nConsider an electron that moves radially outward from\nthe axis of a cylinder in the presence of a magnetic field\n~ parallel to the cylinder. The equation of motion is\nB\nme\n\nwhere ~r is in the plane perpendicular to the axis of the\n~ = 0 and ~r \u00d7 (~v \u00d7 B)\n~ = \u2212(~r * ~v )B,\n~\ncylinder.

Thus, in a charge-neutral system the superfluid\nmoves in a compensating background of positive charge\ndensity \u03c1 = |e|ns .

(12) as for a magnetic moment orbiting\nat radius 2\u03bbL that is subject to a time-dependent radial\nelectric field that grows from zero to its final value Eq.\n(12).\nNote that the finding that the orbital angular momentum of the electron in the Cooper pair is ~/2 (Eq. (20))\nwas not \"built in\". Rather, it was derived (through two\nequivalent routes) from the hypothesis that the size of\nthe orbit is 2\u03bbL , which in turn was inferred from the existence of the Meissner effect, together with the reasonable\nassumption that the outgoing electron magnetic moment\ninteracts with a positive background of equal charge density as the charge of the superfluid (\u03c1 = |e|ns ).\n\n\f4\nThe magnitude of the magnetic field that will stop the\nspin current velocity of one of the spin orientations (the\n~ satisfies, according\none that is parallel to the applied B)\nto Eqs.

Eq. (29) is essentially the lower critical field of a type II superconductor,\nHc1 , that will drive the system normal[4], and it coincides\nwith B\u03c3 , Eq. (16). The flux of the \"stopping field\" Bs\nthrough the area of the orbit of radius 2\u03bbL is precisely\nthe flux quantum \u03a60 .\nIV.\n\nNEGATIVE CHARGE EXPULSION\n\nWe have shown in the previous sections that expansion\nof the electronic orbits from a microscopic dimension to a\nmesoscopic radius 2\u03bbL describes the Meissner effect and\npredicts the Spin Meissner effect[13]. This expansion also\ngives rise to expulsion of negative charge from the interior\nof the superconductor towards the surface, as we discuss\nin what follows.\nIn the normal state, electronic orbits carry zero orbital\nangular momentum on average, however each electron\nhas an intrinsic (spin) angular momentum ~/2. We can\nthink of the spinning electron as a charge e orbiting at\nspeed c in an orbit of radius given by the \"quantum electron radius\" rq \u2261 ~/(2me c) . We have seen that as the\norbit expands to radius 2\u03bbL the orbital angular momentum acquired is also ~/2 (Eq. 20). Thus the electron\norbiting at radius 2\u03bbL with orbital angular momentum\n~/2 can be regarded as a magnified image of the spinning electron, with 'magnification factor' 2\u03bbL /rq . Hence\nit is natural to conclude that the charge e will be correspondingly reduced by the factor rq /(2\u03bbL ), so that the\nexpelled negative charge density is\n\u03c1\u2212 = ens\n\nrq\nv0\n= ens \u03c3 .\n2\u03bbL\nc\n\n(30)\n\nEq. (30) implies that the spin current can be equivalently\nregarded as being carried by charge densities ens /2 orbiting at speed \u00b1v\u03c30 or by charge densities \u03c1\u2212 /2 orbiting\nat speed \u00b1c (the same charge density orbits in each direction in both cases in the absence of applied magnetic\nfield). A similar result holds for the charge current as we\ndiscuss below.\nIndeed it can be shown[25] that the requirement that\nthe theory be relativistically covariant leads to the conclusion that a negative charge density \u03c1\u2212 of magnitude\ngiven by Eq. (30) exists within a London penetration\n\ndepth of the surface of superconductors. This negative\ncharge was expelled from the interior of the superconductor in the transition to superconductivity[26], resulting in\nan interior positive charge density\n\u03c10 = \u2212\n\n2\u03bbL\n\u03c1\u2212\nR\n\n(31)\n\nfor a cylinder of radius R. The electric field generated\nby this internal positive charge density increases linearly\nwith r, the distance to the cylinder axis, and reaches a\nmaximum value\nEm = 2\u03c0\u03c10 R = \u2212\n\n~c\n4e\u03bb2L\n\n(32)\n\nwithin a London penetration depth of the surface. Note\nthat Eq. (32) is the same (in cgs units) as the \"stopping\"\nmagnetic field Eq. (29) as well as the effective spin-orbit\nfield Eq. (16).\nWe can also understand the result Eq. (32) from the\nfollowing heuristic argument. The expelled charge density \u03c1\u2212 is related to Em by\n\u03c1\u2212 = \u2212\n\nEm\n4\u03c0\u03bbL\n\n(33)\n\ndue to charge neutrality. The Meissner current in an\napplied magnetic field B has magnitude\nj = ns |e|vs =\n\nc\nB\nB = |\u03c1\u2212 |c\n4\u03c0\u03bbL\nEm\n\n(34)\n\nEq. (34) can be interpreted as the current created by the\nexcess negative charge \u03c1\u2212 moving at speed\nv\u03c1\u2212 = c\n\nB\nEm\n\n(35)\n\nand suggests that superconductivity will be destroyed\nwhen v\u03c1\u2212 reaches the speed of light. This will occur\nfor B = Em , thus the value of the magnetic field that\nstops the spin current and destroys superconductivity,\nEq. (29), yields the value of the electric field near the\nsurface Em Eq. (32).\nFrom Eqs. (3), (10) and (32) it follows that the electrostatic energy density due to the electric field Em equals\nthe kinetic energy density of the spin current\n1\nE2\nme (v\u03c30 )2 ns = m .\n2\n8\u03c0\n\n(36)\n\nThe same relation exists, as is well known[4], between the\nkinetic energy of the Meissner current and the magnetic\nenergy density\nB2\n1\nme (vs )2 ns =\n.\n2\n8\u03c0\nas can be seen from Eqs.

When the\napplied magnetic field approaches Bs (Eq.

We conclude from this argument that the condensation energy\nof the pair is me (v\u03c30 )2 and hence that the condensation\nenergy per electron is\n\u01ebc =\n\n1\nme (v\u03c30 )2\n2\n\n(49)\n\nwhich equals the electrostatic energy cost per electron\ndue to the internal electric field, Eq.

From this we conclude that the condensation energy of the superconductor\noriginates in the spin-orbit energy lowering arising from\nthe interaction of the spin current of the condensate (of\ncharge density ens and velocity Eq. (10)) with the compensating positive background charge density |e|ns .\nIt is also interesting to note that \u03bd determines the fraction of the superfluid charge density (ens ) that is expelled\n(as suggested in [7]), through the relations\n\u03c1\u2212 = ens (\n\n\u03bd\n\u03bd 1/2\n) = ens (\n)\n|e|Em \u03bbL\nme c 2\n\n(52)\n\nwhere eEm \u03bbL is the electrostatic energy difference between an electron at the center and at radius 2\u03bbL of a\ncylinder with charge density |\u03c1\u2212 |.

Eq.\n(57) shows that indeed \u03bd is the change in the chemical potential in going from the normal to the superconducting\nstate, as anticipated in the \"correlated hopping\" model\nof hole superconductivity[7, 14, 29].\nFurthermore note that a spin current with speed\nEq.

In our case\nthe shift in the chemical potential, \u03bd, is twice as large\n(Eqs. (50) and (61)), and it is directly related to the\nslope of the gap function and to the existence of a spin\ncurrent and of negative charge expulsion.\n\nVII.\n\nTYPE I VERSUS TYPE II MATERIALS\nAND CHARGE INHOMOGENEITY\n\nThe above energetic considerations apply close to the\ncrossover between type I and type II behavior, where\nHc \u223c Hc1 and \u03bbL \u223c \u03be, where \u03be is the coherence length\nwhich is also the average distance between members of\na Cooper pair[4]. In extreme type I materials, pairs are\nbroken well before the charge speed reaches Eq. (10),\nq0 \u223c 1/\u03be << 1/2\u03bbL in Eq. (55) and Em = Hc rather\nthan Eq. (32). We can understand the crossover between\ntype I and type II behavior geometrically, as shown in\nFig. 2. \u03be is the distance between the centers of the 2\u03bbL\norbits of up and down spin electrons in a Cooper pair. A\nvortex core has diameter \u03be, and this normal region can\nbe enclosed by the orbits of both members of the same\nCooper pair if and only if \u03be < 2\u03bbL .\n\nFIG. 3: Schematic depiction of a superconductor with strong\ndisorder in the absence of applied magnetic field. Defects,\ngrain boundaries, vacancies, etc. will result in patches of\nnormal regions (hatched areas) surrounded by spin currents\n(dashed lines, with arrows pointing in the direction of flow\nof electrons with magnetic moment pointing out of the paper) and excess negative charge density (gray areas). The\nfigure also shows the excess negative charge and spin current\nnear the surface. If the system is cooled in the presence of a\nmagnetic field, magnetic flux will be trapped in the hatched\nregions and a charge current will flow around those regions together with the depicted spin currents. The smallest normal\nregions have diameter of a coherence length.\n\nWhy does the vortex core have to be enclosed by the\norbits of both members of the same Cooper pair? The\nphase change for each electron in going around a loop\nenclosing a vortex is\nI\ne\n~\u2206\u03b8 = me~v * d~l + \u03c6B\n(63)\nc\nwhere \u03c6B is the enclosed magnetic flux. For each member of the Cooper pair this phase change is \u03c0, corresponding to its angular momentum ~/2, and thus \u03c6B =\n(h/2)c/e = \u03c60 (assuming the integration loop is through\na path where ~v = 0), thus providing a new rationale for\nthe factor of 2 in the flux quantum \u03c60 . If only one member of the Cooper pair were to enclose the vortex the\nwave function for the pair would not be single-valued.\nThe superconductor expels negative charge towards\nthe surface and towards any interior normal regions, thus\nin the flux phase there will be excess negative charge in\nand around the vortex cores. Furthermore our model\nhas a large sensitivity to disorder arising from the slope\nof the gap function, as discussed in [36]. In the presence\nof local potential variations due to impurities, vacancies,\netc, the gap can be sharply reduced or vanish altogether\ngiving rise to normal regions. There will be excess negative charge in and around those normal regions expelled\nfrom the superconducting regions, and a spin current will\ncirculate around the interior normal regions as shown\n\n\f8\nschematically in Fig. 2. An applied magnetic field will\nconcentrate in these normal or weakly superconducting\nregions and the spin current around them will acquire a\ncharge current component.\nFinally, the model has a strong tendency to phase separation in the regime where the carrier (hole) concentration is small[37]. This arises from the bandwidth dependence on the hole concentration[38]: the bandwidth increases with increasing hole concentration, favoring segregation into hole-rich and hole-poor regions. This tendency is also enhanced in the presence of disorder.\nVIII.\n\nSUMMARY AND DISCUSSION\n\nThe theory discussed here proposes that superconductivity arises from the fundamental charge asymmetry of\nmatter[39]. It was motivated by the discovery of high\nTc cuprates[20] but it was clear from the outset that if\nvalid it would apply to all superconducting materials[40].\nAs the theory progressed it became increasingly apparent that it led to a radical departure from the conven-\n\n[1]\n[2]\n[3]\n[4]\n[5]\n[6]\n[7]\n[8]\n[9]\n[10]\n[11]\n[12]\n[13]\n[14]\n[15]\n[16]\n\n[17]\n[18]\n[19]\n[20]\n[21]\n\nW.A.

The fact that at the end of this road one is\nled, unexpectedly, to a far more compelling (in our view)\nexplanation[11] of the most fundamental property of superconductors, the Meissner effect, than the conventional\ntheory proposes, is in our view a strong argument for its\nvalidity. Ultimately of course confirmation or refutation\nof the theory discussed here will come from experiment.\nAs the theory advanced we have gained increased understanding of what we knew we didn't know, however\nwe have also become aware of issues that previously had\nbeen 'unknown unknowns'[41]. Perhaps the most important of these issues, that remains to be understood, is the\nproper inclusion of the key role of the Dirac sea[42].\nAcknowledgments\n\nI am grateful to F. Marsiglio for collaboration in the\ninitial development as well as later stages of this theory.\n\n[22] J.E. Hirsch, Phys.Rev.B 65, 184502 (2002).\n[23] J.E. Hirsch, Phys.Lett.
