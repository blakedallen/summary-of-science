The transition from the PSC mode to the\nNSC mode as the magnetic field, pressure and dust properties are varied is demonstrated.\nPACS numbers: 52.80.Sm, 85.10.Jz\n\nI.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nA Particle-in-Cell/Monte-Carlo (PIC/MC) simulation\n(van der Straaten et al. 1994, 1997) and semi-analytic\ntreatment (Cramer, 1997) of the radial structure of a\nlow pressure DC cylindrical magnetron discharge has revealed a potential and electric field structure highly dependent on the pressure and magnetic field. As either\nthe pressure was reduced or the magnetic field was increased, the steady state discharge was found to exhibit\na transition from a positive space charge mode (PSC),\ncharacterised by a strong cathode fall as occurs in an\nunmagnetised glow discharge, to a negative space charge\nmode (NSC) characterised by a broad anode fall. The\nreason for the transition to the NSC mode is the strongly\nreduced (according to classical theory) transport of electrons across the magnetic field in a low pressure, strongly\nmagnetised plasma. These two modes of the magnetised\ndischarge have been discussed by Thornton and Penfold\n(1978).\nThere is little conclusive experimental evidence for\nthe NSC mode. The cathode fall is always observed in\nplanar magnetron experiments, even at very low pressures (Rossnagel and Kaufmann 1986, Gu and Lieberman 1988). Experiments by Yeom et al. (1989) with a\ncylindrical magnetron with pressures and magnetic fields\nsimilar to those considered in this paper and in the PIC\nsimulation study (van der Straaten et al. 1997) showed\na distinct cathode fall and no anode fall over the entire\nrange of discharge parameters. Langmuir probe measurements in a cylindrical magnetron were also reported by\nvan der Straaten et al. (1997) with the same discharge\nparameters as used in the simulation, but the results did\nnot agree with the simulation results in that no anode fall\nwas observed at low pressures and high magnetic fields.\nHowever, Hayakawa and Wasa (1965) reported the exis-\n\ntence of a stable discharge operating in what appeared to\nbe the NSC mode. The discharge featured a broad anode\nfall for a magnetic field strength greater than 4kG, which\nis considerably higher than the field strength predicted\nby the fluid model and the simulations (\u2248 100kG) for\nthe onset of the NSC mode. In order to explain the persistence of the cathode fall in the experimental results it\nwould be necessary for the electron transport across the\nmagnetic field, at low pressures and high magnetic field\nstrengths, to be considerably higher than is predicted by\nthe classical transport coefficients. It has been postulated (eg Sheridan and Goree 1989) that turbulence or\nnonlinear coherent modes induced by instabilities in the\npartially ionized plasma in crossed electric and magnetic\nfields (Simon 1963) may increase the diffusion and drift\nof electrons, thus increasing their effective transport coefficients.\nDust macroparticles in a discharge are negatively\ncharged, but are unmagnetized because of their high\nmass. The electrons are highly magnetized, and the ions\nhave intermediate magnetization. This results in different transport rates of the different species across the\nmagnetic field. Depending on the size of the magnetic\nfield, and the relative charge on the different species, the\ndust grains can be the dominant current carrier. The\nspace charge clouds near the electrodes will then be determined by the relative mobility of the different species.\nThe two modes of the discharge will then be affected\nby the charge on, and the current carried by the dust\ngrains. Features unique to the dust particles can also\nplay a role in the structure of the discharge, such as the\nvariable equilibrium charge on the grains, dependent on\nthe local potential and species temperatures, the effect of\ngravity on the grain dynamics, and the rate of charging\nof the grains. The dust grains can also form an ordered\nstructure, the dust-plasma crystal. A fluid model of the\n\n\f2\ndust. Thus we use Poisson's equation in one dimension,\ni.e.\ndE\n= \u03c1/\u01eb0\ndx\n\n(3)\n\nwhere \u03c1 is the net charge density and \u01eb0 is the permittivity of free space.

The\ntransition from the PSC mode to the NSC mode as the\nmagnetic field, pressure and dust properties are varied is\ndemonstrated.\n\nII.\n\nWe consider a one-dimensional model of a magnetron\ndischarge between two parallel plate electrodes, as shown\nin Figure 1.\nWe assume a one-dimensional steady state distribution\nso that all quantities are a function only of the distance\nx from the cathode surface. The magnetic field B is\nuniform and directed parallel to the cathode surface. The\nions and dust grains are assumed to be unaffected by the\nmagnetic field, i.e. the ion and dust Larmor radii are\nassumed to be much larger than the distance d between\nthe anode and the cathode.\nThe electrons have two components of drift velocity,\nvT e transverse to the magnetic field in the x-direction,\nand v\u22a5e perpendicular to both the electric field E and to\nB, where\nvT e = \u2212\n\ne\n\u03bd\nE\nm \u03bd 2 + \u03c9c2\n\nand\n\nv\u22a5e = \u2212\n\ne\n\u03c9c\n(1)\nE\nm \u03bd 2 + \u03c9c2\n\nwhere E is the x-component of E (negative in this case),\n\u03c9c is the electron-cyclotron frequency and \u03bd is the collision frequency of electrons with background gas atoms.\nThe resultant drift of the electrons is at an angle \u03b8 to the\nx-axis given by\ntan \u03b8 = \u03c9c /\u03bd.\n\nwhere we assume a constant flux of dust particles, with\ninitial density and velocity nd0 and vd0 . The dust charge\nvaries in the discharge due to the varying local potential.\nWriting the total current density as J = Ji + Je + Jd ,\nand assuming |vi | \u226a |vd |, we have\n\u0014\n\u0012\n\u0013 \u0015\ndE\nnd Q d\nvi\nJ\n1\u2212 1+|\n| je +\n=\ndx\n\u01eb0 vi\nvT e\n\u01eb0\n\nTHE BASIC EQUATIONS\n\n(5)\n\n(6)\n\nwhere je is the fraction of the total current density due\nto electrons. A boundary condition that can be applied\nis that the electron current at the cathode is due solely\nto secondary emission of electrons caused by ion impact\non the cathode. The secondary emission coefficient \u03b3 =\nje /ji at the cathode is assumed known.\nThe second basic equation we use is the electron charge\nconservation equation, or ionization avalanche equation.\nThe electrons drift through the background neutral gas\nat the angle \u03b8 to the x-axis and ionize the neutral gas\nmolecules, and electron avalanches are formed. These\navalanches are therefore also inclined at the angle \u03b8 to\nthe x-axis. If the coordinate along this direction is \u03b6, the\nnormalized electron current density in this direction is\nj\u03b6e and the electric field in this direction is E\u03b6 , and the\nionization equation may be written\ndj\u03b6e\n= \u03b1j\u03b6e ,\nd\u03b6\n\n(7)\n\nwhere \u03b1 is Townsend's 1st ionization coefficient\n(Llewellyn-Jones 1966),\n\u03b1 = AP exp(\u2212C(P/|E\u03b6 |)s )\n\n(8)\n\n(2)\n\nThe basic equations used are those of Davies and Evans\n(1980), modified to include the magnetic field and the\n\nwhere A and C are constants depending on the gas, P is\nthe gas pressure and s = 1/2 for a monatomic gas. Since\n\u03b6 = x/ cos \u03b8, j\u03b6e = je / cos \u03b8 and E\u03b6 = E cos \u03b8, 7 becomes\n\n\f3\n\n\u0011\n\u0010\ndje\nAP\n= \u03b1\u2032 je =\nexp \u2212C(P/|E| cos \u03b8)1/2 je .\ndx\ncos \u03b8\n\n(9)\n\nThe only difference in equation (9) to the unmagnetized\ncase is therefore the replacement of the pressure P by the\n\"effective pressure\" P/ cos \u03b8.\nThe ion mobility is assumed unaffected by the magnetic field, so we assume, as do Davies and Evans (1980),\nthat\n|vi | = k(|E|/P )1/2\n\n(10)\n\nwhere k is a constant. This gives a good representation of\nthe experimental ion drift (Ward 1962). However we note\nthat this means that the ion and electron drift velocities\nhave different E dependences, so r is not strictly independent of E as we have assumed so far. A dependence\nof r on E would prevent the application of the analysis\nused here, so we neglect it, noting that it could cause an\nerror in our results at high magnetic fields.\nThe charge of a (negatively charged) dust particle is\ndetermined by the current balance equation\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u0014\n\u0015\np\n2eQd (z)\neQd (z) e\u03c6(z)\n\u03c0/8ni (z)v\u0304i (z) 1 \u2212\n=\nn\nv\nexp\n.\n+\n0 e\nami v\u0304i2 (z)\naTe\nTe\n(11)\n\nIII.\n\nRESULTS\n\nThe equations have been solved for a number of cases,\nusing the above prescription, to illustrate the effect on\nthe discharge of increasing the magnetic field and the\ndensity of dust particles. The parameters used in the\nnumerical examples are those of van der Straaten et al\n(1994), viz. d = 2.2cm, P = 5mTorr and 50mTorr,\nand Argon gas, for which A = 29.22cm\u22121 Torr\u22121 , C =\n26.6V1/2 cm\u22121/2 Torr\u22121/2 , electron mobility for zero magnetic field \u03bce = 3 \u00d7 105 cm2 TorrVs\u22121 and k = 8.25 \u00d7\n103 cm3/2 Torr1/2 V\u22121/2 s\u22121 . The corresponding electron\ncollision frequency is \u03bd = 6 \u00d7 109 P s\u22121 where P is in\nTorr. The ratio of ion and electron mobilities in the unmagnetized gas is r0 = 3.3 \u00d7 10\u22123 (Ward 1962).\nFigure 2 shows the electric field, ion velocity and space\ncharge profiles for a pressure of 5mTorr.

Dust charges positive over most of the discharge.\n\nDISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nA numerical solution of the electron, ion and dust fluid\ntransport equations for a magnetized discharge has been\ndeveloped, building on previous work for an unmagnetized steady-state glow discharge. Understanding the\ntransport of charged particles across the magnetic field is\nimportant for modelling the operation of magnetron devices used in plasma processing for industry. The effects\n\n\f5\n\nFIG. 5: A magnetic field is present, with cos \u03b8 = 0.2, but no\ndust is present.\n\nof charge on the dust particles on the transition from a\npositive space charge mode to a negative space charge\nmode as the magnetic field is increased or the pressure is\nreduced has been demonstrated.\nThe presence of dust can create a negative space charge\nregion near the anode, which enhances or mimics the effect of a magnetic field. If however the field is so strong\nthat the ions are magnetized (future work), the dust\ngrains may carry most of the current, which will enhance\nthe positive space charge region.\nV.\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\nThe work was supported by the Australian Research\nCouncil.\n\nFIG. 6: A magnetic field is present, with cos \u03b8 = 0.2, and\nnd0 = 103 .\n\nReferences\n\nCramer N F 1997 J.
