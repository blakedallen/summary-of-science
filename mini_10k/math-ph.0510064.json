It is in the complexification of this surface\nthat we construct the contour integral representation for B5 . Our methods\nare generalizable in principle to higher dimensions, and therefore should be\nof interest for further study.\n\n1 Introduction\nHistorical Background. In 1968, Gabriele Veneziano [18] noticed that an amazing number of abstract properties required by the relativistic scattering amplitude\nfor four colliding spinless particles were embodied in the classical Euler Beta\nfunction, B(\u03b11 , \u03b12 ), which can be defined by the integral representation\nZ 1\nB(\u03b11 , \u03b12 ) =\nx\u03b11 \u22121 (1 \u2212 x)\u03b12 \u22121 dx , Re \u03b11 > 0, Re \u03b12 > 0 .\n(1)\n0\n\nThis observation served as the implausible origin of modern string theory (see,\ne.g., [13, 14] for more details), which grew from the discovery that the Beta function could be related to the vibration modes of a relativistic string sweeping out a\nsurface in spacetime [4, 11].\nAlmost immediately following Veneziano's discovery, a function with a twodimensional integral representation was found that could be related to the relativistic scattering amplitude of five spinless particles [1, 19]. This function, the\ndual five-point function B5 , can be written in various representations such as the\nfollowing integral over a triangular region\nB5 (\u03b11 , \u03b12 , \u03b13 , \u03b14 , \u03b15 ) =\nZZ\n=\nx\u03b11 \u2212\u03b12 \u2212\u03b15 y \u03b12 \u22121 (1 \u2212 x)\u03b13 \u22121 (x \u2212 y)\u03b15 \u22121 (1 \u2212 y)\u03b14 \u2212\u03b13 \u2212\u03b15 dx dy (2)\n0<y<x<1\n\nfor suitably restricted values of the arguments (\u03b11 , \u03b12 , \u03b13 , \u03b14 , \u03b15 ). The discovery\nof this function indicated that the Euler Beta function was not alone: the Euler\nBeta function, which would now be written as B4 (\u03b11 , \u03b12 ), was henceforth to be\nregarded as the first member of the family of N-point functions BN that might\nbe expected to have interesting properties in analysis as well as in the quantum\ntheory of relativistic elementary particles.\n2\n\n\fCross-Ratio Coordinates. A very rapid series of steps subsequently led to what\nbecame the standard Koba-Nielsen representation [10] for the N-point function\nBN (\u03b113 , . . . , \u03b1N \u22122,N ), which can be written as an (N \u2212 3)-dimensional integral\nZ\nZ Y\n\u03b1 \u22121\nBN (\u03b113 , . . . , \u03b1N \u22122,N ) =\n***\nuij ij d\u03bcN ,\n(3)\n0<t1 <***<tN\u22123 <1 i,j\n\nQN \u22124 QN \u22123\nwhere d\u03bcN = dt1 * * * dtN \u22123 / i=1\nti j=2 (1 \u2212 tj ) and the uij are the N-point\ncross-ratios parameterized by t1 , . . . , tN \u22123 as described in detail in Section 2. The\nformulas (1) and (2) correspond to (3) for the cases N = 4 and N = 5, respectively.\nA variety of methods have been employed to study the properties of the BN\nintegrands as functions of complex variables. For example, Koba and Nielson [10]\nexpressed (3) as an integral in a space that was essentially a product of (N \u2212 3)\ncopies of CP1 . As noted by one of the current authors in [6], one can alternatively\nexpress the complex integrand by employing CPN \u22123 cross-ratios (with a much\nlarger symmetry group) in place of the product of (N \u22123) complex projective lines\nwith the single shared linear fractional transformation symmetry characterizing\nthe Koba-Nielsen framework.\nWe will see in the following that, for B5 , the compactification of the set of\nall five-point cross-ratios can be identified with RP2#4RP2 as an algebraic subvariety in RP5 with a polyhedral structure that has 12 pentagonal faces. This\nembedding of RP2 #4RP2 has a symmetry group of order 120 in PGL(6). The\ndouble covering, which is the surface of genus four embedded in S5 \u2282 R6 , has\na corresponding polyhedral structure with 24 pentagonal faces and a symmetry\ngroup of order 240 in O(6). The integral (2) is taken over one of the 12 pentagonal faces of RP2 #4RP2 . This is the starting point for the contour integral\nrepresentation of B5 .\nThe study of such a tessellation on RP2 #4RP2 , the five crosscap surface,\nand its symmetry group dates back to the 19th century [9] and is treated in detail\nin the work of Brahana and Coble in 1926 [2]. It is interesting to see that our\nspace of five-point cross-ratios leads naturally to the same tessellation, and to the\npresentation of the symmetry group in O(6).\nContour Integral Representations. It is well known that the analytic continuation of the function defined by (1) is a meromorphic function of (\u03b11 , \u03b12 ) on the\nentire complex space C2 . In fact, changing variables in the integral allows the\n3\n\n\fBeta function to be rewritten in terms of the standard integral representation of\nthe Gamma function, leading to the explicit analytic continuation formula\nB(\u03b11 , \u03b12 ) =\n\n\u0393(\u03b11 )\u0393(\u03b12 )\n.\n\u0393(\u03b11 + \u03b12 )\n\n(4)\n\nIn 1890, Pochhammer [12] gave another interesting continuation formula for\nB(\u03b11 , \u03b12 ) in the following form,\nB(\u03b11 , \u03b12 ) =\n\n(1 \u2212\n\n\u01eb(\u03b11 , \u03b12 )\n2\u03c0i\u03b1\ne 1 )(1 \u2212\n\ne2\u03c0i\u03b12 )\n\n,\n\n(5)\n\nwhere \u01eb(\u03b11 , \u03b12 ) is a contour integral of \u03b2(z; \u03b11 , \u03b12 ) = z \u03b11 \u22121 (1 \u2212 z)\u03b12 \u22121 along\na properly immersed loop in C \\ {0, 1}, and hence is a holomorphic function of\n(\u03b11 , \u03b12 ).\nOur observation that the B5 function can be expressed by an integral over one\npentagonal face of RP2 #4RP2 leads to a contour integral representation analogous to Pochhammer's classic representation of B4 . We obtain the following\ntwo-dimensional contour integral representation of B5 :\nB5 (\u03b11 , \u03b12 , \u03b13 , \u03b14 , \u03b15 ) =\n=\n\n\u01eb(\u03b11 , \u03b12 , \u03b13 , \u03b14 , \u03b15 )\n.\n(1 \u2212 e2\u03c0i\u03b11 )(1 \u2212 e2\u03c0i\u03b12 )(1 \u2212 e2\u03c0i\u03b13 )(1 \u2212 e2\u03c0i\u03b14 )(1 \u2212 e2\u03c0i\u03b15 )\n\n(6)\n\nHere \u01eb(\u03b11 , \u03b12 , \u03b13 , \u03b14 , \u03b15 ) is a holomorphic function expressed as an integral of a\nholomorphic 2-form along a closed oriented surface of genus 5 properly immersed\nin CP2 #4CP2 . Note that, unlike the representation (2), where (\u03b11 , \u03b12 , \u03b13 , \u03b14 , \u03b15 )\nmust be properly restricted for the integral to be convergent, the representation (6)\nof B5 is a meromorphic function of (\u03b11 , \u03b12 , \u03b13 , \u03b14 , \u03b15 ) and is defined on the entire\nspace C5 . Hence the formula (6) is an explicit analytic continuation formula for\nthe five-point function B5 originally defined by (2).\nWe point out that, to produce the required contour for B5 , not only is the\ntwo-complex-variable environment supplied by the Koba-Nielson product of two\nprojective lines, CP1 \u00d7 CP1 , inadequate, but the richer alternative CP2 framework of [6] is also inadequate. The contour lies instead in CP2 #4CP2 , which is\nthe complexification of the above-mentioned five-crosscap surface RP2 #4RP2\nin RP5 considered as the real part of CP5 .\nWe begin in Section 2 by introducing the N-point cross-ratio, which gives\nrise to the subvarieties upon which our analysis is based. Section 3 constructs\n4\n\n\fthe 12-pentagon tessellation of the five-crosscap surface as the compactification\nof the set of 5-point cross-ratios; its symmetries and the genus-four double cover\nare given in Section 4. Then, in Section 5, we review Pochhammer's classical\nconstruction for the contour integral representation of the Euler Beta function.\nThe framework for studying B5 is set up in Section 6 where the representation\n(6) is proven. Selected constructions are applied to visualizations and computer\ngraphics representations of the relevant structures in Section 7. Remarks on the\nextension to general N are presented in Section 8.\n\n2 Cross-Ratios\nRecall that the cross-ratio of four distinct ordered numbers {w, x, y, z} \u2282 R\u222a{\u221e}\nis defined as\n,\n(w \u2212 y) (x \u2212 y)\n(w \u2212 y)(x \u2212 z)\nu(w, x, y, z) =\n=\n.\n(7)\n(w \u2212 z) (x \u2212 z)\n(w \u2212 z)(x \u2212 y)\nFor any integer N \u2265 4, we define the N-point cross-ratio of a cyclically-ordered\nset of N distinct numbers {x1 , . . . , xN } \u2282 R \u222a {\u221e} as the ordered set of N(N \u2212\n3)/2 numbers (u13 , u14 , . . . , uN \u22122,N ), where\nuij = u(xi , xi+1 , xj+1 , xj ) =\n\n(xi \u2212 xj+1 )(xi+1 \u2212 xj )\n(xi \u2212 xj )(xi+1 \u2212 xj+1 )\n\n(8)\n\nand 1 \u2264 i < j \u2264 N, 2 \u2264 j \u2212 i \u2264 N \u2212 2.\nThe set of all N-point cross-ratios can be considered as a subset of RN (N \u22123)/2 ,\nwhich we denote by C. From the well-known fact that the cross-ratio is invariant under linear fractional transformations of R \u222a {\u221e}, it is clear that C can be\nparameterized by (N \u2212 3) variables, which we denote as (t1 , . . . , tN \u22123 ). That is,\neach point of C is the N-point cross-ratio of the N cyclically ordered numbers\n{0, \u221e, 1, t1, . . . , tN \u22123 },\n\n(9)\n\nfor a unique (t1 , . . . , tN \u22123 ) \u2208 RN \u22123 , where t1 , . . . , tN \u22123 are distinct and not equal\nto 0 or 1.\nFor example, for N = 4, if we set x1 = 0, x2 = \u221e, x3 = 1, and x4 = t, then,\naccording to (8), the set of 4-point cross-ratios in R2 is given by the following\nparameterized curve:\nu13 = u(x1 , x2 , x4 , x3 ) = u(0, \u221e, t, 1) = t\nu24 = u(x2 , x3 , x1 , x4 ) = u(\u221e, 1, 0, t) = 1 \u2212 t .\n5\n\n\fNotice that there are three connected components for the domain of t, as shown in\nFigure 1.\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\nt=1\n\n8\n\n8\n\nt=0\n\nFigure 1: The 3 connected components of the domain of the parameters for the set\nof 4-point cross-ratios.\nFor N = 5, the set of 5-point cross-ratios is a surface in R5 parameterized by\n(s, t) as\nu13 = u(x1 , x2 , x4 , x3 ) = u(0, \u221e, s, 1) = s\nt\nu14 = u(x1 , x2 , x5 , x4 ) = u(0, \u221e, t, s) =\ns\n1\u2212s\nu24 = u(x2 , x3 , x5 , x4 ) = u(\u221e, 1, t, s) =\n1\u2212t\nu25 = u(x2 , x3 , x1 , x5 ) = u(\u221e, 1, 0, t) = 1 \u2212 t\ns\u2212t\n.\nu35 = u(x3 , x4 , x1 , x5 ) = u(1, s, 0, t) =\ns(1 \u2212 t)\n\n(10)\n\nThe domain of (s, t) has twelve connected components, as shown in Figure 2.\nOne can verify that the cross-ratios uij defined by (8) satisfy\nuij = 1 \u2212\n\nj\u22121\nY\n\ni\u22121\nY\n\numn\n\n(11)\n\nm=i+1 n=j+1\n\nwith the convention that umn = unm and um,n+N = um,N for all 1 \u2264 m, n \u2264 N.\nIn fact, the affine algebraic subvariety in RN (N \u22123)/2 defined by (11), minus a set\nof measure zero, is precisely the set C of N-point cross-ratios.\nIn particular, for N = 4, the constraint (11) becomes\nu13 = 1 \u2212 u24 .\n\n(12)\n\nThe set C is the affine algebraic subvariety in R2 with coordinates (z1 , z2 ) given\nby the linear equation\n1 \u2212 z1 \u2212 z2 = 0 .\n(13)\n6\n\n\fFor N = 5, we have\nu13\nu14\nu24\nu25\nu35\n\n=\n=\n=\n=\n=\n\n1 \u2212 u24 u25\n1 \u2212 u25 u35\n1 \u2212 u35 u13\n1 \u2212 u13 u14\n1 \u2212 u14 u24 ,\n\n(14)\n\nand C is the affine algebraic subvariety in R5 with coordinates (z1 , z2 , z3 , z4 , z5 )\ngiven by\n1 \u2212 z1 \u2212 z3 z4\n1 \u2212 z2 \u2212 z4 z5\n1 \u2212 z3 \u2212 z5 z1\n1 \u2212 z4 \u2212 z1 z2\n1 \u2212 z5 \u2212 z2 z3\n\n=\n=\n=\n=\n=\n\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0.\n\n(15)\n\n8\n\ns\n\n=\n\nt\n\nRemark. It can be verified that the system (15) has rank 3 at the zero locus,\nand therefore does actually define a smooth algebraic subvariety of dimension 2.\n\n11\n\n12\n\n3\nt=1\n\n4\n10\n\n5\n1\nt=0\n\n9\n\n2\n\n7\n\ns\n\n=\n\nt\n\n6\n\ns=1\n\ns=0\n\nFigure 2: The 12 connected components of the domain of parameters for the set\nof 5-point cross-ratios.\n7\n\n\fNow consider the corresponding projective subvarieties. For N = 4, (13)\nbecomes\nz0 \u2212 z1 \u2212 z2 = 0 ,\n(16)\n\nwhich obviously defines a projective line in RP2 with homogeneous coordinates\n[z0 , z1 , z2 ].\nSimilarly, for N = 5, (15) yields the following homogeneous quadratic equations in the homogeneous coordinates [z0 , z1 , z2 , z3 , z4 , z5 ] of RP5 :\nz02 \u2212 z0 z1 \u2212 z3 z4\nz02 \u2212 z0 z2 \u2212 z4 z5\nz02 \u2212 z0 z3 \u2212 z5 z1\nz02 \u2212 z0 z4 \u2212 z1 z2\nz02 \u2212 z0 z5 \u2212 z2 z3\n\n=\n=\n=\n=\n=\n\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0.\n\n(17)\n\nOne can verify that (17) defines a smooth two-dimensional subvariety in RP5 ,\nwhich we will denote by M. To see the topology of M, we examine the parameterization (10). As we will show in detail in Section 3, the image of each of the\ntwelve connected components of the parameter domain has a smooth pentagonal\nclosure tessellating M as shown in Figure 3. Extending (17) to complex variables\ndefines a complex algebraic variety M c that is obviously the complexification of\nthe real manifold M. M c is CP2 with four points blown up and is topologically\nhomeomorphic to CP2 #4CP2 .\nThe tessellation represented in Figure 3 has 12 pentagonal faces, (12 \u00d7 5)/2 =\n30 edges, and (12 \u00d7 5)/4 = 15 vertices; the Euler number of M is thus \u03c7 =\n15 \u2212 30 + 12 = \u22123, and therefore M is the connected sum of five RP2 's, i.e., a\nsphere with five crosscaps. Therefore, viewing the five-crosscap surface as the set\nof cross-ratios yields a natural tessellation with 12 pentagonal faces, which we can\ncall a \"dodecahedron\" even though it does not bound a 3-ball. This tessellation\nwas already described in detail from the point of view of combinatorial topology\nin the 19th century [9]. In 1926, Brahana and Coble [2], also arrived at the same\ntessellation of a sphere with five crosscaps as a map of 12 countries with five sides,\nand studied the symmetry group in detail (see also recent work by Weber [20] for\nadditional historical background). Such tessellations were generalized by Stasheff\nfor use in his study of the homotopy theory of H-spaces [15\u201317], and, in particular, the analogous tiles in higher dimensions are called associahedra. These have\nplayed a prominent role, e.g., in the work of Devadoss [3]. Our discovery of the\nrelation between the five-crosscap dodecahedral tessellation and the 5-point cross8\n\n\fratios, as well as the apparent relation between the higher-dimensional analogs and\nthe N-point cross-ratios, should thus be of further interest.\n\n3 Closure of the 5-Point Cross-Ratio Set in RP5\nWe now present a detailed treatment of the pentagonal tessellation for M. In the\nhomogeneous coordinates of RP5 , we will write the parameterization (10) as\n\u0014\n\u0015\nt 1\u2212s\ns\u2212t\np(s, t) = 1, s, ,\n, (1 \u2212 t),\ns 1\u2212t\ns(1 \u2212 t)\n\u0002\n\u0003\n2\n= s(1 \u2212 t), s (1 \u2212 t), t(1 \u2212 t), s(1 \u2212 s), s(1 \u2212 t)2 , s \u2212 t . (18)\n\nOn the triangular connected component 0 < t < s < 1, as (s, t) \u2192 (0, 0)\nor (s, t) \u2192 (1, 1), the images do not converge to a point. To extend the parameterization to the boundary of the domain, we will replace the parameters (s, t) as\nfollows.\nFirst, let\n\u001a\n(2u \u2212 uv, uv),\nfor 0 < u \u2264 12 , 0 < v < 1\n(19)\n(x, y) =\n(1 \u2212 v + uv, \u22121 + 2u + v \u2212 uv), for 21 \u2264 u < 1, 0 < v < 1.\n14\n\n14\n\n13\n\n6\n8\n\n8\n11\n\n12\n\n2\n\n12\n\n3\n\n4\n\n11\n9\n\n10\n\n1\n\n4\n\n15\n\n8\n\n1\n\n5\n9\n\n10\n15\n\n5\n4\n\n15\n11\n\n2\n\n5\n\n6\n\n3\n7\n\n15\n\n10\n\n3\n\n7\n\n9\n\n2\n\n7\n6\n\n13\n\n14\n\n14\n\nFigure 3: The pentagonal tessellation of the closure of the set of 5-point crossratios.\n9\n\n\fThe formula (19) defines a 1-1 map between the open square (0, 1) \u00d7 (0, 1) in the\nuv-plane and the open triangle 0 < y < x < 1 in the xy-plane, as shown in Figure\n4.\ny\n\nv\n\n(1,1)\n(1,1)\n\n(0,1)\n\n=\u21d2\n\nx\n\nu\n\n(0,0)\n\n(1/2, 0)\n\n(1,0)\n\n(0,0)\n\n(1,0)\n\nFigure 4: The map from the square 0 < u, v < 1 in the uv-plane to the\ntriangular region 0 < y < x < 1 in the xy-plane.\nNext, in Table 1, we present twelve formulas that give 1-1 maps between the\nopen triangular domain 0 < y < x < 1 and each of the twelve connected components shown in Figure 2.\nComposing (18), the entries in Table 1, and (19), we get a parameterization for\neach of the 12 connected components of C on the common domain (0, 1)\u00d7(0, 1) in\nthe uv-plane. We will denote these parameterizations by f1 , . . . , f12 , respectively.\nIt can be verified that each of the f1 , . . . , f12 extends as a 1-1 parameterization\nto the closed square [0, 1] \u00d7 [0, 1]. Each of the twelve images is a smooth, closed,\npentagonal surface patch whose vertices correspond to\n(u, v) = ( 12 , 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (0, 1), (0, 0) .\nExamining the pentagons one by one, we find they are joined together to form\nthe closed surface represented by Figure 3.\nFor future reference, we list below the homogeneous coordinates of the 15\n\n10\n\n\fn The map from the region 0 < y < x < 1 to the connected\ncomponent n in Figure 2.\n1 s = x, t = y\n2 s = (x \u2212 y)/(1 \u2212 y), t = y/(y \u2212 1)\n3 s = 1/(xy), t = x/y\n4 s = y, t = x\n5 s = y/(y \u2212 1), t = (x \u2212 y)/(1 \u2212 y)\n6 s = x/(x \u2212 1), t = (x \u2212 y)/(x \u2212 1)\n7 s = (x \u2212 y)/(x \u2212 1), t = x/(x \u2212 1)\n8 s = x/y, t = 1/(xy)\n9 s = (1 \u2212 y)/(x \u2212 y), t = y/(y \u2212 x)\n10 s = 1/(1 \u2212 y), t = (1 \u2212 x)/(1 \u2212 y)\n11 s = (1 \u2212 x)/(1 \u2212 y), t = 1/(1 \u2212 y)\n12 s = y/(y \u2212 x), t = (1 \u2212 y)/(x \u2212 y)\nTable 1: Transformations from the triangular region 0 < y < x < 1 to the 12\nconnected components in Figure 2.\n\nvertices:\nv1\nv2\nv3\nv4\nv5\nv6\nv7\nv8\n\n=\n=\n=\n=\n=\n=\n=\n=\n\n[1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1]\n[1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1]\n[1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0]\n[1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0]\n[1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1]\n[0, 0, \u22121, 0, 1, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, \u22121, 0, 1]\n[0, 1, 0, 0, \u22121, 0]\n\nv9\nv10\nv11\nv12\nv13\nv14\nv15\n\n=\n=\n=\n=\n=\n=\n=\n\n[0,\n[0,\n[0,\n[0,\n[0,\n[0,\n[0,\n\n0, 1, 0, 0, \u22121]\n\u22121, 0, 1, 0, 0]\n0, 0, 1, 0, 0]\n0, 0, 0, 0, 1]\n0, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n0, 0, 0, 1, 0]\n1, 0, 0, 0, 0] .\n\n(20)\n\n4 Symmetries and the Double-Covering Lift\nOne can see using combinatorial arguments that the tessellation of M shown in\nFigure 3 has many symmetries. We will present the group of symmetries as follows.\nOne of the symmetries, when restricted to face 1 , is a rotation that transforms\nthe vertices 1,2,3,4,5 to 2,3,4,5,1. This symmetry also transforms vertex 12 to\n11\n\n\fvertex 15. Using the coordinates of these vertices from (20), we construct the\nmatrix\nX5 = B * A\u22121\n\nwith A the 6 \u00d7 6 matrix given by A = [v1 v2 v3 v4 v5 v12 ], where v1 , etc., are\nwritten as column vectors whose components are specified by (20). Similarly,\nB = [v2 v3 v4 v5 v1 v15 ], yielding\n\uf8f9\n\uf8ee\n1 0 0 0 0 0\n\uf8ef 0 0 1 0 0 0 \uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8ef\n\uf8ef 0 0 0 1 0 0 \uf8fa\n\uf8fa ,\n\uf8ef\n(21)\nX5 = \uf8ef\n\uf8fa\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n\uf8fa\n\uf8ef\n\uf8f0 0 0 0 0 0 1 \uf8fb\n0 1 0 0 0 0\nAnother symmetry is the reflection along the edge joining v3 and v4 , which\ntransforms vertices 1,2,3,4,5,12 to 12,7,3,4,9,1. As above, one constructs\n\uf8f9\n\uf8ee\n1 0\n0\n0\n0 \u22121\n\uf8ef 2 0 \u22121 0 \u22121 \u22121 \uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8ef\n\uf8fa\n\uf8ef 0 0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n\uf8fa .\n(22)\nX2 = \uf8ef\n\uf8ef 0 0\n1\n0\n0\n0 \uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8ef\n\uf8f0 2 \u22121 0 \u22121 0 \u22121 \uf8fb\n0 0\n0\n0\n0 \u22121\n\nThe following observations are essential: Viewing X5 and X2 as elements of\nPGL(6), one can verify that the zero-locus of (17) is invariant under the corresponding transformations of RP5 . X5 and X2 generate a group of order 120,\nwhich is isomorphic to the group of automorphisms of M mentioned above. In\nother words, we have embedded the automorphism group of M in PGL(6).\nIn fact, X5 and X2 generate a subgroup G of order 120 in GL(6).

This will lead us to the contour integral\nrepresentation for B5 to be presented in Section 6.\nLet\n\u03b2(z; \u03b11 , \u03b12 ) = z \u03b11 \u22121 (1 \u2212 z)\u03b12 \u22121 .\n(29)\nwhere (\u03b11 , \u03b12 ) is a pair of arbitrary complex numbers. Considered as a function\nof z, \u03b2 defines a family of holomorphic functions on a proper Riemann covering\nsheaf S over C \\ {0, 1}. Let C be a closed and oriented curve in S that is the\nlift of the closed and oriented curve in C \\ {0, 1} shown in Figure 6, where we\nlabel the line segments by their relative phases in the lift. This is known as the\nPochhammer contour.\n\u03b11 + \u03b1 2\n1\n\n0\n\n0\n\u03b12\n\nr\n\n\u03b11\n\nFigure 6: The Pochhammer contour C for the Euler Beta function.\nNext, define\n\u01eb(\u03b11 , \u03b12 ) =\n\nZ\n\n\u03b2(z; \u03b11 , \u03b12 ) dz .\n\nC\n\nClearly \u01eb(\u03b11 , \u03b12 ) is a holomorphic function of (\u03b11 , \u03b12 ) and is invariant under continuous deformations of C. Therefore, letting r \u2192 0+ in Figure 6, one easily sees\nthat, if Re \u03b11 > 0 and Re \u03b12 > 0, then\nZ 1\n2\u03c0i\u03b11\n2\u03c0i\u03b12\n\u01eb(\u03b11 , \u03b12 ) = (1 \u2212 e\n)(1 \u2212 e\n)\nx\u03b11 \u22121 (1 \u2212 x)\u03b12 \u22121 dx ,\n0\n\nwhich yields the formula (5).\nIf \u03b11 (or \u03b12 , resp.) is an integer \u2265 1, then the holomorphic 1-form \u03b2(z; \u03b11 , \u03b12 ) dz\non S descends to a holomorphic 1-form on a proper Riemann covering sheaf over\nC \\ {0} (or C \\ {1}, resp.). Since the curve in Figure 6 is contractible in C \\ {0}\n(or C \\ {1}, resp.), \u01eb(\u03b11 , \u03b12 ) = 0.\n15\n\n\fFigure 7: The deformation of the Pochhammer contour to a null contour when\nthe conditions \u03b11 + \u03b12 = 0, \u22121, \u22122, . . . remove the branch point at infinity (open\ncircle).\nNotice that, by letting w = 1/z, we have\nz \u03b11 \u22121 (1 \u2212 z)\u03b12 \u22121 dz = \u2212(w \u2212 1)\u03b12 \u22121 w \u2212\u03b11 \u2212\u03b12 dw .\nThis shows that, if (\u03b11 + \u03b12 ) is a non-positive integer (\u03b11 + \u03b12 = 0, \u22121, \u22122, . . .),\nthe holomorphic 1-form \u03b2(z; \u03b11 , \u03b12 ) dz on S descends to a holomorphic 1-form\non a proper Riemann covering sheaf over CP1 \\ {0, 1}, where as usual we identify\nCP1 with C \u222a {\u221e}. Since the curve in Figure 6 is contractible in CP1 \\ {0, 1}\n(see Figure 7), it therefore follows that \u01eb(\u03b11 , \u03b12 ) = 0 also in this case. Figure 7\nshows how the contractibility of the contour can be made explicit.\nFrom these observations and (5), one concludes in particular that the poles of\nB(\u03b11 , \u03b12 ) can only occur at points where either \u03b11 or \u03b12 is a non-positive integer.\nFurthermore, B(\u03b11 , \u03b12 ) = 0 if neither \u03b11 nor \u03b12 is a non-positive integer, but\n(\u03b11 + \u03b12 ) is a non-positive integer. These properties of course also follow directly\nfrom (4); in fact these are precisely all the poles and zeroes of B(\u03b11 , \u03b12 ).\n\n6 Contour Representation of the Function B5\nWe now view M as the real two-dimensional surface in M c , as defined at the\nend of Section 2. The manifold M c can be visualized by the complexification\nof Figure 3; with the edges of the pentagon taken off, M c is now parameterized\nby two complex parameters that we denote as (z1 , z2 ), replacing (s, t) in (18).\n16\n\n\fFollowing the procedure in Section 5, let\n\u03b25 (z1 , z2 ; \u03b11 , \u03b12 , \u03b13 , \u03b14 , \u03b15 ) =\n= z1\u03b11 \u2212\u03b12 \u2212\u03b15 z2\u03b12 \u22121 (1 \u2212 z1 )\u03b13 \u22121 (z1 \u2212 z2 )\u03b15 \u22121 (1 \u2212 z2 )\u03b14 \u2212\u03b13 \u2212\u03b15 .\n\n(30)\n\nThen (2) can be viewed as the integral of the (locally) holomorphic 2-form \u03b25 dz1 \u2227\ndz2 (with branched singularities) on M c over the domain 1 on M.\nThe function \u03b25 can be viewed as a 5-complex-parameter family of locally\nholomorphic functions on M c with branched singularities at the edges of the pentagons evident in the complexification of Figure 3.\nLet S be the Riemann covering sheaf of \u03b25 over M c \\ {branch lines}. We will\nconstruct an orientable closed surface in S that is the lift of a closed surface in M c\nobtained by wrapping properly around the five (complex) edges of the pentagonal\ndomain 1 . This will then lead to the formula (6).\nA function such as \u03b25 is only defined on M c , away from singularities, up\nto a factor e2\u03c0i\u03b3 , i.e., by a phase \u03b3 which is an integer linear combination of\n\u03b11 , * * * , \u03b15 . To lift a surface wrapping around the branch lines to the covering\nsheaf S, on which \u03b25 is a holomorphic function, we first need to understand how\nthe phase of \u03b25 changes on a piece of surface as it makes a simple fold back around\none branch line (see Figure 8).\n\nBR\n\nAN\n\nCH\n\nLIN\n\nE\n\nFigure 8: A surface sheet folds back around a codimension two branch line.\nIt is obvious that if a surface folds back around the branch line z2 = 0, z1 = 1,\nor z1 \u2212 z2 = 0, then the phase of \u03b25 changes by \u00b1\u03b12 , \u00b1\u03b13 , or \u00b1\u03b15 , respectively,\nwhere the sign + or \u2212 depends on the folding direction, i.e., whether the direction\nis counterclockwise or clockwise.\nTo see how the the phase of \u03b25 changes on a surface folding around the branch\nline A (see Figure 9), let (w1 , w2) be the coordinates around A chosen so that A is\n17\n\n\f14\n\nC\n\n13\n\n6\n\n15\n\nB\n\n3\n\n4\n\n11\n9\n\n10\n15\n5\n\n6\n8\n\nA\n4\n\n2\n\n1\n\n10\n\nA\n5 z =0\n2\n\n9\n\n7\n\n1\n\n6\n\n13\n14\n\n2\n\n4\n\nD\n\n1\n\n2\n\nB\n\n15\n11\n\n15\n\n5\n\n9\n\n7\n\n10\n\n1\n\n4\n\n3\n\n2\n\n5\n\nD\n\n3\n\nz =1\n1\n\n7\n\n12\n\nz\n\n2\n\n1 =\n\n12\n\n3\n\n8\n\n8\n11\n\nz\n\n14\n\nC\n\n14\n\nFigure 9: The pentagonal domains of the B5 integrand, with detailed pentagonal\nbranch structure shown for region 1.\n\n(z = z2)\n1\n\nw =0\n2\n\n(z 2 = 0)\n\nz\n1=\n\nz\n2\n\nw =1\n2\n\nw =0\n1\n(A)\n\n=\u21d2\n\nA\nz =0\n2\n\nFigure 10: The coordinates around the branch line at A.\ngiven by w1 = 0, and away from A, w1 = z1 , w2 = z2 /z1 (cf. [5] and Figure 10).\nWe can then write \u03b25 as\n\u03b25 (z1 , z2 ; \u03b11 , \u03b12 , \u03b13 , \u03b14 , \u03b15 ) =\n= w1\u03b11 \u22122 w2\u03b12 \u22121 (1 \u2212 w1 )\u03b13 \u22121 (1 \u2212 w2 )\u03b15 \u22121 (1 \u2212 w1 w2 )\u03b14 \u2212\u03b13 \u2212\u03b15 .\nIt is now easy to see that as a surface folds back around A, the phase of \u03b25 changes\nby \u00b1\u03b11 . Similarly, one can show that as a surface folds back around B, the phase\nof \u03b25 changes by \u00b1\u03b14 .\nWe now construct an immersed surface in M in three steps as follows:\n18\n\n\f\u03b1\n\u03b1\n\n(z = z )\n5 1 2\n\n4\n\n(B)\n\n\u03b1 (z = 1)\n3 1\n\u03b1 1 (A)\n\u03b1\n\n2\n\n(z = 0)\n2\n\nFigure 11: The pentagonal sheets in region 1 .\nStep 1. Consider a set of 32 copies of the pentagonal sheets stacked over the region\n1 in Figure 9, with a small neighborhood of the five corners taken off\nfor now. From what we have shown above, it is appropriate to label the\nedges of each pentagonal sheet at A, z2 = 0, z1 = 1, B, z1 \u2212 z2 = 0 by\n\u03b11 , \u03b12 , \u03b13 , \u03b14 , \u03b15 , respectively (see Figure 11).\nWe attach to each of these pentagonal sheets a phase label\np 1 \u03b11 + p 2 \u03b12 + p 3 \u03b13 + p 4 \u03b14 + p 5 \u03b15 ,\nwhere pj = 0 or 1 for j = 1, . . . , 5. Each pentagonal sheet is given an\norientation which is same as or opposite\nto the original natural orientation\nP\non region 1 according to whether pj is even or odd.\n\nStep 2. Two pentagonal sheets in Step 1 are joined along the edge \u03b1j by folding\naround the corresponding branch line in the proper direction (see Figure\n8) if and only if their phase numbers differ by \u03b1j . It is easy to see that\nwe end up with an immersed oriented surface in M \\ {branch lines} that\ncan be lifted to S. However, this surface has 40 holes caused by the small\nneighborhoods that we removed around the corners where the branch lines\nintersect. In Figure 12, we show a single instance of one of these holes.\nStep 3. To show that one can fill in these holes, we observe that a small 3-sphere\naround an intersection of two branch lines, with the branch lines taken off,\nis homotopic to a torus and hence its fundamental group is isomorphic to\nthe Abelian group Z \u00d7 Z. It is easy to see that the boundary of a small\nhole at this intersection, which lies in the surrounding 3-sphere, represents\n19\n\n\f0\n\n\u03b1\n\n\u03b11\n\n1\n\n\u03b12\n\n\u03b11+\u03b1 2\n\u03b1\n\n1\n\n\u03b12\n\n0\n\n\u03b1\n\u03b12\n\n\u03b1\n\n\u03b11\n\n\u03b11\n\n2\n\n\u03b11+\u03b1\n\n2\n\n2\n\nIntersection enclosed in S\n\n3\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 12: (a) The hole at a single corner.

This section is motivated by the observation that, since there are\nalgebraic constructions for every geometric concept, we can go one step further\nand show precise images of each construction, helping the reader to develop a\nquantitative as well as a qualitative understanding of the framework we have developed. We establish the basic context with some examples based on the Euler\nBeta function, and then proceed to show some of the remarkable manifolds that\noccur in the B5 analysis.\n\n7.1 B4 Connected Components Embedded in a Veronese Surface\nThe Euler Beta function itself can be analyzed using cross-ratio coordinates. We\nbegin with the two cross-ratio variables, x1 and x2 , obeying the apparently uninteresting constraint\nx1 = 1 \u2212 x2 .\nHowever, when we put this into homogeneous coordinates {x0 , x1 , x2 }, the constraint becomes x0 = x1 + x2 , and we can solve these equations independently in\nthe three component regions, written as three intervals in inhomogeneous coordinates as A = [0, 1], B = [1, \u221e], and C = [\u2212\u221e, 0]. Noting that the space we are\n21\n\n\fnow dealing with is not C or CP1 , but the real part of the CP2 cross-ratio-space,\nwe can parameterize each interval in homogeneous RP2 coordinates as follows:\nA(t) :\nB(t) :\nC(t) :\n\n[1, t, (1 \u2212 t)]\n[(1 \u2212 t), 1, \u2212t]\n[\u2212t, (1 \u2212 t), \u22121] .\n\n(31)\n\n8\n\nWe see that region A solves 1 = x1 + x2 with x1 = t, B solves 1 = x1 + x2\nwith x1 = 1/(1 \u2212 t) when all is multiplied by (1 \u2212 t), and C solves 1 = x1 + x2\nwith x1 = (t \u2212 1)/t when all is multiplied by t. The interpolating functions in the\nthree regions obviously correspond to the three B4 component regions introduced\ninitially in Figure (1), and they interpolate between the points represented in the\nRiemann-sphere depiction of Figure 13:\n= [0,1]\n\n1 = [1, 1]\n\n0 = [1,0]\n\nFigure 13: The full base space of the B4 branched covering, showing the three\nregions corresponding to the three intervals (0, 1), (1, \u221e), and (\u2212\u221e, 0) on the\nreal projective line.\n\np1\np2\np3\n\nRP2 homog\nCP1 (z0 , z1 )\nC inhomog (z1 /z0 )\n= A(0) = [1, 0, 1]\n\u2248 z = [1, 0]\n\u2248 x=0\n= B(0) = [1, 1, 0]\n\u2248 z = [1, 1]\n\u2248 x=1\n= C(0) = [0, 1, \u22121]\n\u2248 z = [0, 1]\n\u2248 x = \u00b1\u221e .\n\nBut there is a small problem: if we follow the coordinate interpolations carefully, they only work projectively; the actual interpolations close on one another\n22\n\n\fonly if we include the negative, projectively-equivalent points p\u0304i = \u2212pi , for a total\nof 6 points and six linear paths, rather than three. Thus, the projective coordinates\nfor the three components A, B, C can be plotted either as a connected hexagon\nin R3 , the embedding space of the homogeneous RP2 coordinates, or as a more\nvisually consistent projection onto a constant-radius S2 , the double-cover of RP2 ,\nas shown in Figure 14(a).\nTo actually achieve the desired end result of a visualization of the B4 crossratio coordinates in a logical embedding, we must find a quadratic map that removes the distinction between the positive and negative versions of the same projective coordinates and maps S2 explicitly to RP2 . This is achieved classically\nby the Veronese surface (see, e.g., the traditional embedding of RP2 given in the\nappendix of Hilbert and Cohn-Vossen, [7]):\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u221a\nw1 = 2x0 x1 w2 = 2x0 x2 w3 = 2x1 x2\n(32)\nw4 = (x0 )2\nw5 = (x1 )2\nw6 = (x2 )2\n2\n2\n2\nwhere the sphericalPconstraint xP\n0 + x1 + x2 = 1 implies the standard Veronese\n2\nsurface constraint (wi )2 = ( (xk )2 ) = 1. In Figures 14(b) and (c), we see\nthe exact paths of the three component integrals of the Euler Beta function as they\nare embedded in alternate projections of RP2 (the real part of CP2 ) to 3D. This\nis equivalent mathematically, and yet a significantly contrasting viewpoint, to the\nconventional CP1 alternative indicated in Figure 13.\n\n7.2 Visualizing the B4 Pochhammer Contour\nWe now illustrate explicitly the geometry of the Pochhammer contour for the Euler Beta function. Starting from (29), we choose a pair of small relatively prime\nrational exponents (\u03b11 , \u03b12 ), and project the 4D plot of w = \u03b2(z; \u03b11 , \u03b12 ) to 3D,\nwith the horizontal plane parameterized by x = Re(z), y = Im(z), and the vertical axis given by Re(w). Figure 15(a) shows a small region of the branched\nRiemann cover of the complex plane punctured at z = 0 and z = 1, and Figure\n15(b) shows the precise path in this branched cover of the Pochhammer \"commutator\" contour sketched in Figure 6, but now as an actual embedding in C2\n(technically R4 projected to R3 ). Figure 15(c) combines the two views to show\nthe Pochhammer contour in its geometric context on the Riemann surface.\n\n23\n\n\f1\n0.5\n0\n-0.5\n-1\n1\n\n0.5\n\n0\n-0.5\n-1\n-1\n-0.5\n0\n0.5\n1\n\n(a)\n-0.5\n\n-0.5\n\n0.5\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n-0.5\n0.5\n\n0.5\n\n1\n0.75\n0.5\n0.25\n0\n\n0\n\n-0.5\n\n0.5\n0\n-0.5\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\nFigure 14: (a) The double cover of B4 branched covering, showing the linear interpolations among the points p1 = (1, 0, 1), p\u03041 = (\u22121, 0, \u22121), p2 = (1, 1, 0), p\u03042 =\n(\u22121, \u22121, 0), p3 = (0, 1, \u22121), p\u03043 = (0, \u22121, 1) and their projections to S2 .

For B5 ,\nthe analog of one of these lines is a pentagonal surface, and the set of four lines\nrepresenting integration domain of B4 with distinct phases is replaced in B5 by\n32 pentagons with distinct phases. Just as the three lines in Figure 13 or Figure\n14 describe the three components of B4 that followed from solving the cross-ratio\nconstraint, the twelve components of B5 can be studied using parametric solutions of its own cross-ratio constraint system: re-indexing for convenience using\n(z1 , z2 , z3 , z4 , x5 ) \u2261 (u12 , u13 , u23 , u24 , u34 ), the B5 cross-ratio system becomes:\nz1\nz2\nz3\nz4\nz5\n\n=\n=\n=\n=\n=\n\n1 \u2212 z3 z4\n1 \u2212 z4 z5\n1 \u2212 z5 z1\n1 \u2212 z1 z2\n1 \u2212 z2 z3 .\n\n(33)\n\nAny pentagon can be represented algebraically by picking two of the five zi 's\nas independent, and plotting any of the dependent variables found by solving the\nconstraints in formula (33) on the third axis. The typical result, shown in Figure\n16, is an algebraic 2-manifold embedded in R5 showing the integration region over\nthe variety given by (33). Projected from a horizontal direction, the pentagon of\nFigure 16(a) becomes a square region, whereas when projected from the vertical\ndirection, it becomes a triangular region, corresponding to formula (2).\nTo create an image of the twelve B5 components, we now use the constraints\n(33) and proceed through the same arguments that we used for B4 : We solve\nthe constraints in a family of homogeneous RP5 coordinates based on choosing\nnon-singular parameterizations of (z0 , z1 , z2 , z3 , z4 , z5 ), and find that the natural\nconnectivity actually gives us initially the 24-pentagon double cover analogous\nto the six B4 curves shown in Figure 14(a). Figure 17 is the schematic analog\nof Figure 13 for B4 , showing the topological diagram of the surface, which we\ncan verify is non-orientable with 15 vertices, 30 edges, and 12 pentagonal faces,\ngiving the advertised Euler characteristic \u03c7 = \u22123, a sphere with five crosscaps.\nHowever, we can also see traced on this surface the family of complex lines that\nform the symmetrized base of the branched cover enabled by the blow-ups: there\nare 10 separate interlocking triangles, each denoting the (circular) real line of a\nCP1 corresponding precisely to the B4 diagram of Figure 13 or 14(b); treating\n26\n\n\f1\n\n0.75\n\n0.5\nu\n0.25\n01\n\n1\n\n0.75\n\n0.75\n0.5\ny\n\n0.5\nx\n0.25\n\n0.25\n0 0\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\nFigure 16: (a) Plotting the B5 variables (x, (1 \u2212 x)/(1 \u2212 xy), y), showing how\nthe \"blown-up\" pentagonal manifold arises naturally in the cross-ratio manifold.\n(b) Completely regular version of the pentagonal, normalized to S5 and projected,\ncorresponding to the variables of Figure 4. (c) Side view of (b).\nthese schematically as filled-in triangles, we get the image in Figure 18, where\nthe boundaries of the 10 triangles taken five at a time bound the 12 pentagons.\nThe corresponding 12-pentagon figure can be thought of as shown in Figure 17,\nwhere the boundaries of the connected components (corresponding to \u2212\u03b11 \u2212 \u03b12\nfor B4 ) are linear combinations of the B5 \u03b1i 's. In particular, the face labeled\n\"12\" corresponds to a B5 function with a set of exponents that is distinct from\nthe values (\u03b11 , \u03b12 , \u03b13 , \u03b14 , \u03b15 ) used in (2), although they are closely related. One\ncan show with suitable variable changes that the exponents corresponding to the\n\n27\n\n\fprimed branch lines (analogous to the exponent at infinity for B4 ) are\n\u03b1\u2032 1\n\u03b1\u2032 2\n\u03b1\u2032 3\n\u03b1\u2032 4\n\u03b1\u2032 5\n\n=\n=\n=\n=\n=\n\n1 + \u03b11 \u2212 \u03b12 \u2212 \u03b15\n1 + \u03b12 \u2212 \u03b13 \u2212 \u03b11\n1 + \u03b13 \u2212 \u03b14 \u2212 \u03b12\n1 + \u03b14 \u2212 \u03b15 \u2212 \u03b13\n1 + \u03b15 \u2212 \u03b11 \u2212 \u03b14 .\n\n(34)\n\nThe solutions of the constraints are continuous only in the double cover, so\nwe will work first in an unnormalized RP5 to produce the analogs of the six end\npoints and six straight interpolating edges that we showed in Figure 14(a) for B4 .\nThis equivalent set of vertices is the set of 10 hexagons representing the double\ncover of the CP1 branch lines denoted by (\u03b11 , . . . , \u03b1\u2032 1 , . . .), as shown in Figure\n19.

If all we were interested in was the descriptive topology of the B5 five-crosscap base manifold, any set of vertices with the\nproper connectivity would be sufficient. However, our dual purpose is to understand not only the topology, but also any unique geometric features or symmetries\nthat might characterize this manifold, leading to embeddings whose graphical depictions might be especially informative.\nWe have therefore pursued the search for special embeddings one step further,\nand computed an orthonormalized set of vertices along with the corresponding\nsurface embedding that allows all pentagons to be expressed as rigid transformations of one another derived from the operations of the discrete symmetry operators of Section 4.\n\n28\n\n\f\u03b12'\n\n\u03b15'\n\n\u03b13'\n\n\u03b14'\n\n13\n12\n\n\u03b13\n\n11\n12\n\n12\n11\n\n13\n\n12\n\n4\n\n\u03b14\n\n10\n\n14\n\n12\n\n12\n\n10\n9\n6\n\n13\n\n11\n15\n\n14\n13\n\n13\n\n\u03b11\n\n10\n\n2\n9\n\n11\n\n12\n\n7\n\n1\n\n5\n\n5\n\n11\n15\n\n1\n\n6\n\n15\n\n12\n\n11\n2\n\n15\n\n13\n\n6\n\n8\n\n3\n\n8\n\n\u03b12\n14\n\n14\n\n8\n\n4\n\n7\n\n14\n\n15\n\n\u03b11'\n\n15\n\n3\n\n7\n\n9\n\n14\n\n12\n\n11\n\n12\n12\n\n\u03b15\nFigure 17: The diagram of how the 12 pentagonal pieces of surface join together\nto form a closed surface in RP5 .

This manifold\ncan be drawn explicitly in various ways by joining together the sets of commutators that eventually return to the same phase, forming the closed surface; Figure\n23 illustrates a single commutator element. Figure 24 shows the schematic diagram of the full set of commutators as they return cyclically to the home phase;\nthis diagram can be unfolded in various ways to show the overall structure, as\nillustrated in Figures 25 and 26.\nFinally, the explicit algebraic form of the Pochhammer can be embedded directly in the Riemann manifold of \u03b25 (x, y; \u03b11, . . . , \u03b15 ), following the fashion of\nFigure 15 to yield the surfaces shown in Figure 27. This image shows one-fifth of\nthe Pochhammer contour covering a set of eight of the 32 total surfaces; sewing\ntogether all the corresponding copies yields the entire surface.\n\n8 Remarks on the General Case\nThe affine variety defined by the N-point cross-ratio constraints (11) is of dimension (N \u22123) and has a natural decomposition into (N \u22121)!/2 smooth components\ndelineated by the varieties uij = 0.

The second\ncolumn gives the dimension of the projective space that implements the blow-up\nin cross-ratio coordinates; this is the same as the number of faces of the polytope\ndefined by the natural uij = 0 boundaries of the integration region for one component using the cross-ratio coordinates; these are not necessarily regular polytopes.\nThe third column is the total number of components, i.e., the number of polytopes\nthat fit together to give the analogs of the 5-crosscap dodecahedron for B5 .\n\nof the (N \u2212 1)!/2 components is an N(N \u2212 3)/2-polytope - its (i, j)-th face is\non the projective hyperplane given by uij = 0; these are not in general regular\npolytopes, but reflect the existence of various poles that correspond to multiparticle combinations in elementary spinless string theory. Table 2 summarizes for\nlow N the number of cross-ratio variables appearing in the standard constraints,\nwhich is also the number of faces of the polytope defining a single component,\nalong with the total number of components. These polytopes have an exact and\npreviously unsuspected correspondence with the Stasheff associahedra [15\u201317],\nin all dimensions. Each of the B6 components, for example, is a nonahedron, as\npictured in Figure 28; this structure is described in detail by Devadoss [3], who\n6\nalso gives, for example, a tessellation of the moduli space M0 (R) tiled by 60 nonN\nahedral associahedra. Our work seems to indicate that the moduli spaces M0 (R)\nstudied by Devadoss can also be viewed as the space of N-point cross-ratios with\nthe tessellations we have described in this paper.\nWe conjecture that the real integral form of BN can always be expressed alternatively by a Pochhammer-like contour integral in the corresponding smooth\ncomplex algebraic variety M c of dimension (N \u2212 3) in CPN (N \u22123)/2 . The contour\nis a real (N \u2212 3)-dimensional submanifold and is obtained by wrapping copies of\nthe N(N \u22123)/2-polytope integral domain properly around the branch hyperplanes\n40\n\n\fFigure 28: This nonahedron is the elementary connected component of the 6-point\ncross-ratios forming the basis for the analysis of B6 ; just as 12 pentagons tessellate\nthe 5-crosscap surface, 60 of these nonahedra tessellate the analogous 3-manifold.\nwhere its faces are located. Notice that it is fairly easy to see, by the description\nabove and (3), that the branch hyperplane at each face \u2013 say, face (i, j) \u2013 is of complex codimension 1 in M c and, when folded around it, the phase of the integrand\nin the lift to the Riemann covering sheaf changes by \u00b1\u03b1ij . By this mechanism,\n(6) should generalize in an obvious way.\n\nAcknowledgments\nThis research was supported in part by NSF grant numbers CCR-0204112 and IIS0430730.
