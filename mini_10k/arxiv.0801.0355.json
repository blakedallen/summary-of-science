It refers to a strong variation\nof the real interaction potential with incident energies\nclose to the Coulomb barrier. It is connected with the increasing strength of the imaginary potential corresponding to the increasing availability of local energy to excite\nreaction channels in the same energy domain. The connection is through a dispersion relation [2,3] that arises\nfrom the causality in heavy ion collision. The dispersion integral involves the real and imaginary components\nthat need to be evaluated at a certain radius value while\ninvestigating the energy dependence of the polarization\npotentials. The general convention is to evaluate these\nquantities at the strong absorption radius. However, the\nquestion is whether the so-called strong absorption radius corroborates with the most sensitive radius or not\nas the bombarding energy decreases? Roubos, et al., [4]\nhave recently studied the scattering of 6 Li and 16 O from\nheavy mass target 208 Pb to investigate the radius of sensitivity for these systems. The authors observed that for\nthe tightly bound systems the appropriate radius of evaluation of dispersion relation is the strong absorption radius but for weakly bound systems that is not the case.\nIt is therefore important to ascertain the radial region\nof sensitivity of the potentials before making use of the\ndispersion relation. Work has also been carried out in\nthis direction in Refs.[5-8]. In this context we present\na systematic study of the elastic data of 6 Li and 16 O\nprojectiles on two different isotopes of medium mass Ni\ntarget to determine the radial region of the potential sensitivity and to identify the difference in observation for\nthe weakly and strongly bound nature of the projectile\nas the target mass decreases.\n\nExper. value\naw=0.485fm\naw=0.585fm\naw=0.635fm\naw=0.685fm\n\n10-1\n\nExper. value\naw=0.695fm\naw=0.745fm\naw=0.795fm\naw=0.845fm\naw=0.895fm\n\n10-1\n\n10-2\n40\n\n\u03c3/\u03c3Ruth\n\narXiv:0801.0355v1 [nucl-ex] 2 Jan 2008\n\nMili Biswas\u2217\n\n80\n\n120\n\n160\n\n40\n\n80\n\n120\n\n160\n\n6Li+64Ni, 17MeV\n\n6Li+64Ni, 13MeV\n\n100\n\n100\nExper. value\naw=0.615fm\naw=0.665fm\naw=0.715fm\naw=0.765fm\naw=0.815fm\n\n10-1\n\n10-2\n40\n\n80\n\n120\n\n\u03b8c.m.

The M3Y nucleon-nucleon interaction in DDM3Y [14,15] convention was used for the\ncalculation that includes an intrinsic energy dependence\nthrough a multiplicative factor of g(E)=(1-0.002E).\nTo obtain the best fit parameters of the potentials analysis was started with the highest energy data for all the\nsystems. At the highest energy with the model potential Umod (r) we performed an initial search over all the\nfour parameters (\u03bbr , W0 , rw , aw ) simultaneously. Subsequently, the imaginary radius parameter obtained from\nthe initial search was kept fixed. The best fit, determined\nby \u03c72 minimization, was found by searching over the\nreal renormalization factor and the imaginary strength\nwhile gridding over the imaginary diffuseness aw .

Coulomb barrier is 13.8MeV in lab frame according\nto Broglia and Winther [17]\n\ngood fit to the elastic scattering angular distributions\nshown in Fig.1 with different diffusivities.\nIt was observed that if we varied the diffusivities beyond the range of values shown, the different sets of potential parameters would not intersect proving that they\nare no good potentials describing the elastic scattering\nangular distributions properly. The same procedure has\nbeen performed for the system 16 O+58,64 Ni. In Fig.2, all\nthe calculated angular distributions with different diffusivities have been shown. Though the \u03c72 /N values of the\nfits vary within the range of 2\u03c72min /N, the corresponding\nfits are quite good. The observed departure at large angles are well within the error limit of the data. For these\nsystems the crossing points are close to the strong absorption radius where the various reactions are expected\nto take place. The search code ECIS94 [16] was used to\nperform the model calculations. The optical model potential parameters obtained following the above search\nprocedure along with the \u03c72 /N (N denotes the number\nof data points) values and the reaction cross sections \u03c3R\nwith different diffusivities have been given in TablesI-II.\nIt is to be noted that with the chosen model potential our search procedure will only provide the crossing\npoint for the imaginary potential. No crossing will be\nobserved in the real potentials as the shapes and fall-off\nof these potentials are pre-fixed.

The variation of crossing point radius\nor sensitive radius with incident energy is not significant.\nTherefore the evaluation of the dispersion integral at the\nstrong absorption radius is quite justified. For the weekly\nbound projectiles, the behavior is different. The crossings\nfor 6 Li+58,64 Ni are located in the vicinity of the strong\nabsorption radius for higher bombarding energies, but\nthe values are larger by \u223c20% than the strong absorption\nradius at lower bombarding energy. Similar observation\nfor light targets has also been reported by Roubos, et\nal.,[4]. Hence care should be taken while evaluating the\ndispersion relation in the investigation of energy dependence of effective potential for loosely bound projectiles.\nThe crossing radii obtained for 6 Li+64 Ni and 16 O+64 Ni\nare compared in TableIII.\nAn interesting aspect of the work in Ref.[4] is the observation of two crossing points at below or top of the\nbarrier energies for 6 Li+208 Pb and 16 O+208 Pb systems.\nThe authors have shown that the one at higher radius\nvalue corresponds to nearside scattering and the other at\nlower radius value corresponds to farside scattering. To\nidentify the crossings associated with nearside and farside scattering we followed the prescriptions of Ref.[4].\nWe have performed our analysis in two steps for all the\nsaid four systems at top of the barrier energies. First we\nhave fitted our elastic angular distributions considering\nthe forward angle data only that is, 15o \u2264 \u03b8c.m. \u2264 125o\n, angles up to the point where the ratio of the angular distribution to Rutherford drops to \u223c0.5. Next we\nhave taken into account only the backward angle data,\nmore specifically, 123o \u2264 \u03b8c.m. \u2264 176o, to obtain the\nfit. We did not observe the \"two crossings\" situation\nfor both 6 Li+58,64 Ni and 16 O+58,64 Ni systems at near\nbarrier energies.

Possibly the said\ndecoupling between the nearside and farside scattering\ndid not occur at this mass region.\nThe energy dependent nature of the crossing point radius for weakly bound 6 Li+58,64 Ni systems has been depicted in Fig.3 where the crossing radii for 6 Li+64 Ni at\n\n[1] G.R.

The same energy dependence has been observed in case of 6 Li+58 Ni system too. Interestingly these\ncrossing radii are closer to the interaction distances at\nwhich the ratio \u03c3/\u03c3Ruth for those energies drops to 98%.\nThis possibly indicates that unlike the strongly bound\nprojectiles where fusion at relatively lower radius dominates the absorption process at near barrier energies, the\nabsorption for loosely bound projectile like 6 Li is dominated by reactions at large separation. Breakup at large\nseparation or single neutron transfer leading to unbound\nejectiles could be possible reaction processes controlling\nthe absorption on approaching the barrier.\nIn summary, we have performed a systematic radial\nsensitivity analysis of 16 O+58,64 Ni and 6 Li+58,64 Ni\nelastic scattering data. Two-crossing effect at the barrier\nhas not been observed for any of the four systems\nstudied. However, as pointed out by Roubos, et al.[4],\nto probe the existence of two crossings requires more\nexperiments emphasizing the backward angle data with\ngood statistics in the light mass targets.\nAcknowledgments\n\nThe author would like to thank Prof. Subinit Roy for\nhis generous help and fruitful discussions to carry out this\nwork.
