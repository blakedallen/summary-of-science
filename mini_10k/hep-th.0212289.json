Generally a comprehensive analysis of their structure is not a simple task. In the Lagrangian\nformulation the problem includes, in particular, finding generators of gauge symmetries\nand their algebra, revealing the hidden structure of the equations of motion and so on. One\nought to say that in the Hamiltonian formulation there exists a relatively well-developed\nscheme of constraint finding (Dirac procedure [1]) and reorganization [1, 2, 3, 4]. The\nconstraint structure can be, in principle, related to the symmetry properties of the initial\ngauge theory in the Lagrangian formulation [5]. However, in the general case, this relation\ncannot be considered as a constructive method to study the Lagrangian symmetries (it is\nindirect and complicated). Moreover, the modern tendency is to avoid the non-covariant\nhamiltonization step and to use the Lagrangian quantization [6] for constructing quantum\ntheory. Such an approach incorporates all the Lagrangian structures (in particular, the\ntotal gauge algebra). That is why it seems important to develop a reduction procedure\n\u2217\nNaturwissenschaftlich-Theoretisches Zentrum und Institut f\u00fcr Theoretische Physik, Universit\u00e4t\nLeipzig, Germany; e-mail: geyer@itp.uni-leipzig.de\n\u2020\nInstitute of Physics, University of Sao Paulo, Brazil; e-mail: gitman@fma.if.usp.br\n\u2021\nLebedev Physics Institute, Moscow, Russia; e-mail: tyutin@lpi.ru\n\n1\n\n\fwithin the Lagrangian formulation \u2013 in a sense similar to the Dirac procedure in the\nHamiltonian formulation \u2013 that may allow one in a constructive manner to reveal the\nhidden structure of the Euler-Lagrange equations (ELE) of motion and to find all the\ngauge identities and therefore the generators of all the gauge transformations. An idea of\nsuch a procedure was first mentioned in publications of the authors (D.G and I.T) [7, 8]\n(see also Appendix C in [2]), but was not appropriately elaborated and some important\npoints where not revealed.\nIn the present paper we return to this idea studying the structure of the ELE for a\ngeneral Lagrangian theory (singular, with higher derivatives, and with external fields). In\nSect. II we introduce some notation and definitions. In Sect. III, we reduce the ELE of\nnonsingular theories to the so called canonical form (in the canonical form the equations\nare solved with respect to highest-order derivatives of nongauge coordinates, whereas,\ngauge coordinates and their derivatives enter in the right hand sides of the equations as\narbitrary functions of time, see below). In Sect. IV we formulate the reduction procedure\nfor the singular case. In a sense, the reduction procedure reveals constraints in the\nLagrangian formulation of singular systems and, in that respect, is similar to the Dirac\nprocedure in the Hamiltonian formulation. In Sect. V we demonstrate how the reduction\nprocedure reveals the gauge identities between the ELE. Thus, a constructive way of\nfinding all the gauge generators within the Lagrangian formulation is presented. At the\nsame time it is proven that for local theories all the gauge generators are local in time\noperators. In the Appendix we collect some Lemmas being useful for our consideration.\n\n2\n\nGeneral ELE\n\n2.1\n\nNotation, definitions, and conventions\n\nWe consider a system with finite degrees of freedom (classical mechanics). These degrees\nof freedom are described by the generalized coordinates q a , a = 1, ..., n, which depend on\nthe time t. The following notation is used:\nq\u0307 a =\n\ndl q a\ndq a a d2 q a\na[l]\n, q\u0308 =\n,\n*\n*\n*\n,\nor\nq\n=\n, l = 0, 1, ...,\ndt\ndt2\ndtl\n\n\u0001\nq a[0] = q a .\n\n(1)\n\nThe coordinates q a = q a[0] are called sometimes velocities of zeroth order; the velocities\nq\u0307 a = q a[1] are called velocities of the first order; the accelerations q\u0308 a = q a[2] are called\nvelocities of second order, and so on. The space of all the velocities is often called the jet\nspace, see [9].\nAs local functions (LF) we call those functions that are defined on the jet space and\ndepend on the velocities q a[l] up to some finite orders Na \u2265 0 (l \u2264 Na ). Further, we call\nNa the order of the coordinate q a in the LF. For the LF we use the following notation1 :\n\u0001\n\u0001\nF (q a , q\u0307 a , q\u0308 a , ...) = F q a[0] , q a[1] , q a[2] , ... = F q [l] , q [l] = (q a[l] , 0 \u2264 l \u2264 Na ),\n\u0001\n\u0001\nor sometimes : F q [l] = F * * * q a[Na ] .\n(2)\nIn the latter form, we indicate only the highest-order derivatives in the arguments of the\nLF.\n1\n\nThe functions F may depend on time explicitly, however, we do not include t in the arguments of\nthe functions.\n\n2\n\n\fThe following notation is often used: [a] is the number of the indices a, namely, if\na = 1, ...n, then [a] = n. Similarly, suppose Fa (\u03b7) , a = 1, ..., n are some functions, then\n[F ] is the number of these functions, [F ] = n, etc. . However differently, writing q a[l] we\ndenote by [l] the order of the time derivatives, see (1).\nOn the jet space, we define local operators (LO) to be matrix operators \u00db of the form\n\u0012 \u0013k\nK\nX\nd\nk\n,\n(3)\nuAa\n\u00dbAa =\ndt\nk=0\nwhere K is a finite number and ukAa are some LF. The LO act on columns of LF fa\nproducing columns of LF FA = \u00dbAa fa as well. We define the transposed operator to \u00db as\n\u0012 \u0013k\u2212l\n\u0013k\nK \u0012\nK\nk \u0012 \u0013\n\u0010 \u0011\nX\nX\nX\nd\nk k[l] d\nk\nT\nk\n\u2212\n\u00db\n=\nuAa\nuAa =\n(\u22121)\n.\n(4)\nl\ndt\ndt\naA\nk=0\nk=0\nl=0\nThen the following relation holds true\nFA \u00dbAa fa =\n\nh\u0010\n\n\u00db T\n\n\u0011\n\ni\nd\nFA fa + Q ,\ndt\naA\n\n(5)\n\nwhere FA , fa , and Q\u0010 are\u0011 LF. The LO \u00dbab is symmetric (+) or skewsymmetric (\u2212)\nwhenever the relation \u00db T\n= \u00b1\u00dbab holds true.\n\u0011\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u0010ab\nA\nA\nSuppose a set of LF FA * * * q a[Na ] , or a set of equations FA * * * q a[Na ] = 0 , be\n\ngiven. In the general case the orders NaA of the coordinates q a in the functions FA (in the\nequations FA = 0) are different, i.e. these orders depend both on a and A. The number\nNa = maxA NaA is called the order of the coordinate q a in the set of the functions FA (in\nthe set of the equations FA = 0).\nWhenever, a subset FA\u2032 = 0, A\u2032 \u2282 A has orders Na\u2032 of the coordinates less than the\ncorresponding orders of the complete set, namely, \u2200a : Na\u2032 < Na , we call this subset the\nconstraint equations.\n\u0001\n\u0001\nGenerally two sets of equations, FA q [l] = 0 and f\u03b1 q [l] = 0 are equivalent whenever\nthey have the same set of solutions. In what follows we denote this fact as: F = 0 \u21d0\u21d2\nf = 0.\n\u0001\n\u0001\nSuppose that two sets of LF FA q [l] and \u03c7A q [l] , [F ] = [\u03c7] , are related by some LO,\nF = \u00db\u03c7 , \u03c7 = V\u0302 F , \u00db V\u0302 = 1 .\n\n(6)\n\nThen we call such functions equivalent and denote this fact as: F \u223c \u03c7 . Obviously,\nF \u223c \u03c7 =\u21d2 F = 0 \u21d0\u21d2 \u03c7 = 0 .\nIf (7) holds true, we will call the equations FA = 0 and f\u03b1 = 0 strong equivalent.\nIn what follows we often meet the case where\n\u0012\n\u0013\nf\u03b1\n\u03c7A =\n, A = (\u03b1, G) ; \u2200G : 0G \u2261 0 .\n0G\n\n(7)\n\n(8)\n\nHere the equivalence F \u223c \u03c7 implies the equivalence of the equations F = 0 and f = 0\nand the existence of the identities V\u0302GA FA \u2261 0. Namely,\n\u001a\nF = 0 \u21d0\u21d2 f = 0\nF \u223c \u03c7 =\u21d2\n.\n(9)\nV\u0302GA FA \u2261 0\n3\n\n\f2.2\n\nELE\n\nBelow we restrict our consideration to the Lagrange functions L that are LF on the jet\nspace, and depend on some external coordinates (fields) u\u03bc (we call the coordinates u\u03bc\nexternal ones in contrast to the coordinates q a , which we call inner coordinates) which\nare some given functions of time. Thus,\n\u0001\nL = L * * * q a[Na ] ; u\u03bc , a = 1, ..., n, Na \u2265 0.\n(10)\n\nThe orders Na of the inner coordinates q a in the Lagrange function will be called further\nthe proper orders of the coordinates. Coordinates q a with the proper orders Na = 0, we\ncall the degenerate coordinates [10].\nEquations of\nR motion of a Lagrangian theory (the ELE) follow from the action principle\n\u03b4S = 0, S = Ldt , and have the form (merely the inner coordinates have to be varied):\n\u0013l\nNa \u0012\nX\n\u03b4S\nd\n\u2202L\n\u2212\n=\n= 0 , a = 1, ..., n .\na\na[l]\n\u03b4q\ndt\n\u2202q\nl=0\n\n(11)\n\nFollowing [10], we classify the Lagrangian theories as nonsingular (M 6= 0) and singular\n(M = 0) ones by the help of the generalized Hessian M = det ||Ma b ||, where\nMa b =\n\n\u22022L\n\u2202q a[Na ] \u2202q b[Nb ]\n\n(12)\n\nis the generalized Hessian matrix.\nIn what follows the ELE of a nonsingular (singular) theory will be called the nonsingular\n(singular) ELE.\nSometimes, it is convenient to enumerate the inner coordinates and organize them\ninto groups such that q a = (q a0 , ..., q aI ) , where ai are groups of indices that enumerate\ncoordinates having the same proper orders, Nak = nk . Besides, we organize these groups\nsuch that nI > nI\u22121 * * * > n0 = 0 (max Na = NaI = nI , and q a0 are the degenerate\ncoordinates, Na0 = n0 = 0 ). Thus,\nX\na = (ak , k = 0, 1, ..., I) , [a] =\n[ai ] , [ai ] \u2265 0 , nI > nI\u22121 * * * > n0 = 0 .\n(13)\ni\n\nTaking into account the notation (13), we may write the Lagrange function and the ELE\nas:\n\u0001\nL = L * * * q ak [nk ] ; u\u03bc , k = 0, 1, ..., I ;\n(14)\n\u0001\n(15)\nFak * * * q b[Nb +nk ] ; * * * u\u03bc[nk ] = 0 ,\n\u0001\n\u001a\nMak b q b[Nb +nk ] + Kak * * * q b[Nb +nk\u0001\u22121] ; * * * u\u03bc[nk ] , k = 1, ..., I\n. (16)\nFak =\nMa0 * * * q b[Nb ] ; u\u03bc = \u2202L/\u2202q a0\nHere Mak b is the generalized Hessian matrix and Kak and Ma0 are some LF of the indicated\narguments.\nConsider the orders of the inner coordinates in the complete set of the ELE. These\norders are Na = Na + nI . One can see that these orders are, in fact, defined by a subset\nof (15) with k = I . In any subset of the equations (15) with k < I the orders of the\n4\n\n\fcoordinates are less than in the complete set. Then according to the above definition, all\nthe ELE with k < I are constraints. The set (15) has the following specific structure: In\neach equation of the complete set the order of a coordinate q a is the sum of the proper\norder Na and of the order nk . The latter is the same for all the coordinates and depends\nonly on the number ak of the equation.\n\n2.3\n\nCanonical form\n\nLet a set of equations\n\u0001\nFA * * * q a[Na ] = 0 ,\n\n(17)\n\nbe given. Suppose that these equations can be transformed to the following equivalent\nform:\n\u0001\nq \u03b1[l\u03b1 ] = \u03c6\u03b1 * * * q \u03b1[l\u03b1 \u22121] ; * * * q g[lg ] , q a = (q \u03b1 , q g ) , a = (\u03b1, g) , la \u2264 Na .\n(18)\n\nThe equation (18) present the canonical form of the initial set (17). In the canonical\nform the equations are solved with respect to the highest-order time derivatives q \u03b1[l\u03b1 ] of\nthe coordinates q \u03b1 . The coordinates q g (if they exist) and their derivatives q g[lg ] enter\ninto the set (18) as arbitrary functions of time. In fact, there are no equations for these\ncoordinates. In what follows we call these coordinates the gauge coordinates whereas q \u03b1\nwe call the nongauge coordinates. The orders of the coordinates in the canonical forms\nmay be less than those in the initial set. In the general case, one and the same set of\nequations can have different canonical forms. Generally there are many canonical form of\nthe same set of equations.\nBelow, we are going to formulate a general procedure of reducing the ELE to the\ncanonical form (in what follows it is called the reduction procedure). Our consideration is\na[l]\nalways local in a vicinity of a given consideration point q0 (in the jet space), which is on\nshell w.r.t. the ELE. We consider theories and coordinates where the consideration point\ncould be selected as zero point. Thus, we suppose that the zero point is on shell. Further\nwe always suppose that the ranks of the encountered Jacobi matrices2 are constant in a\nvicinity of the consideration point. Such suppositions we call \"suppositions of the ranks\".\nSaying that some suppositions hold true in the consideration point, we always suppose that\nthey hold true in a vicinity of the consideration point. In course of the reduction procedure\nwe perform several typical transformations with LF or with the corresponding equations.\nEach of such transformations lead to equivalent sets of equations or to equivalent sets of\nLF (definitions of such equivalences are given above). The proof of these equivalences is\nbased on two Lemmas which are presented in the Appendix. Any statement of the form\n\"the following equivalence holds true\" can be easily justified by these Lemmas.\n\n3\n\nCanonical form of nonsingular ELE\n\n3.1\n\nA particular case\n\nConsider theories without external coordinates and with only two different proper orders\nof the inner coordinates. In such a case all the indices a can be divided into two groups:\n2\n\nA retangular matrix with elements \u2202A\u03b1 /\u2202xi is often denoted as \u2202A/\u2202x and called the Jacobi matrix.\n\n5\n\n\f\u0001\na = (a1 , a2 ) , such that Na2 = n2 > Na1 = n1 , L = L * * * q a2 [n2 ] , * * * q a1 [n1 ] . Consider first\nthe case n1 > 0. Then Eqs. (15) can be written as:\n\u0001\nFa2 = Ma2 a q a[Na +n2 ] + Ka2 * * * q b[Nb +n2 \u22121] = 0 ,\n(19)\n\u0001\na[Na +n1 ]\nb[Nb +n1 \u22121]\nFa1 = Ma1 a q\n+ Ka1 * * * q\n= 0.\n(20)\nThe equations (20) are constraints.

To this end we need to differentiate (31)\nnot more than n2 \u2212 n1 \u2212 1 times. Finally, we obtain the following strong equivalent form\n(the equivalence is justified by the Lemma 1) of the ELE:\n\u0012\nh\ni\nh\ni\u0013\nh\ni\nb|2 Nb|2 +n2 \u22121\nb|1 Nb|1 +n1 \u22121\na|2 Na|2 +n2\na|2\n***q\nq\n=f\n,***q\n,\n\u0012\nh\ni\ni\u0013\nh\nh\ni\nb|2 Nb|2 +n1\nb|1 Nb|1 +n1 \u22121\na|1 Na|1 +n1\na|1\n***q\nq\n=f\n,***q\n.\n(32)\nIt is just the canonical form.

However, the\nprocedure that was used for that purpose did not provide the proof of the equivalence\nbetween the initial ELE and the form (33).\n\n7\n\n\fSuppose now that the Lagrange\u0001 function contains degenerate coordinates q a0 , a =\n(a0 , a1 ) . Thus, L = L q a0 , * * * q a1 [n1 ] and the ELE read:\n\u0001\nFa1 \u2261 Ma1 a q a[Na +n1 ] + Ka1 * * * q b[Nb +n1 \u22121] = 0 ,\n\u0001\n\u2202L\nFa0 \u2261 a0 = Ma0 * * * q b[Nb ] = 0 .\n\u2202q\n\n(34)\n(35)\n\nDespite these equations are formally different from the above case, the whole procedure\nof reductions goes through without any essential change.

Here the Lagrange function may contain some\ndegenerate inner coordinates, higher derivatives of some inner coordinates,\nand, moreover,\n\u0001\na[Na ]\n\u03bc\nmay depend on some external coordinates, L = L * * * q\n; u , Na \u2265 0 . Thus, we are\ngoing to deal with the nonsingular ELE of the form (15). Our aim is to present these\nequations in an equivalent canonical form.\n\nTheorem 1: The nonsingular ELE (15) can be transformed to the\nfollowing equivalent canonical form:\n\u0010\n\u0011\nf ai|k = q ai|k [ni +nk ] \u2212 \u03c6ai|k * * * q bj|k\u2212 [nj +nk\u2212 \u22121] , * * * q bj|k+ [nj +nk ] ; * * * u\u03bc[nk ] = 0 ,\nI \u2265 k+ \u2265 k + 1, k \u2265 k\u2212 \u2265 0, i, j, k = 0, 1, ..., I ,\n\n(38)\n\nwhere the indices of the coordinates are divided into groups as follows: a =\n(ai ) is the division of the indices w.r.t. the proper orders of the coordinates,\nand besides\nai = ai|k , i, k = 0, 1, ..., I\n\n\u0001\n\n,\n\n\u0002\n\nX\u0002 \u0003 X\u0002 \u0003\n\u0002 \u0003\n\u0003\nak|i = [ai ] = a|i .\nai|k =\nai|k \u2265 0,\nk\n\n8\n\nk\n\n\fMoreover, the equivalence F \u223c f between the corresponding LF holds true.\nThat implies\nFa = \u00dbab f b , f b = V\u0302 ba Fa , \u00dbab V\u0302 bc = \u03b4 ca ,\n\nwhere \u00db and V\u0302 are LO. Besides, that implies the strong equivalence between the\nELE and their canonical form (38).\nThe proof of the Theorem 1 may be considered, in fact, as the general reduction\nprocedure to the canonical form for the nonsingular ELE.\nIt is reasonable to divide the reduction procedure into two parts. These parts may be\ncalled conditionally \"the preliminary resolution\", and \"the subordination procedure\".\nP reliminary resolution\nLet us introduce the notation a = (a, aI ) , a = (ak , k = 0, 1, ..., I \u2212 1) , Na < nI ,\nsuch that the ELE read:\n\u0001\n\u0001\nFaI * * * q b[Nb +nI ] ; * * * u\u03bc[nI ] = MaI b q b[Nb +nI ] + KaI * * * q b[Nb +nI \u22121] ; * * * u\u03bc[nI ] = 0 , (39)\n\u0010\n\u0011\nF * * * q b[Nb +Na ] ; * * * u\u03bc[Na ] = 0 .\n(40)\na\n\nRecall that the equations (40) can be considered as constraints.\nThe first step of the procedure is the following: We consider the consistency conditions of the constraints. Namely, we consider the equations that are obtained from the\nconstraints by differentiating them nI \u2212 na times,\n\n(1)\n\n\u0001\n[nI \u2212Na ]\n= Ma b q b[Nb +nI ] + Ka(1) * * * q b[Nb +nI \u22121] ; * * * u\u03bc[nI ] = 0 .\nFa\n\n(41)\n\nHere Ka are some LF of the indicated arguments. Remark that the orders of all the\ncoordinates in the set (41) coincide with the ones in the complete set.

At the same time, the rectangular matrix Ma a has the maximal rank [a].\nTherefore, there exists a division of the indices a such that:\n\u0002 \u0003\n\u0001\na = \u0101, a|I , [\u0101] = [a] , a|I = [aI ] , det Ma\u0101 6= 0 .\n(43)\nThus, the division (13) of the indices a w.r.t. the coordinate proper orders becomes more\ndetailed,\n\u0001\n\u0001 \u0002 \u0003\nai = \u0101i , ai|I , \u0101 = (\u0101i ) , a|I = ai|I , ai|I \u2265 0 ,\nX\u0002 \u0003 \u0002 \u0003\nX\nai|I = a|I = [aI ] ,\n[\u0101i ] = [\u0101] = [a] .\ni\n\ni\n\nDue to (43), the set (41) can be solved with respect to the derivatives q \u0101[N\u0101 +nI ] as:\n\u0014\n\u0015\nh\ni\n\u0001\n\u0001\nb|I Nb|I +nI\n(1)\nb[Nb +nI \u22121]\n\u03bc[nI ]\n\u0101[N\u0101 +nI ]\n\u22121 \u0101a\n(M3 )a b|I q\n+ Ka * * * q\n, (44)\n;***u\nq\n= \u2212 M1\n9\n\n\fwhere\n(M2 )aI b\u0304 (M4 )aI b|I\n(M1 )a b\u0304 (M3 )a b|I\n\nMab =\n\n!\n\n.\n\nExcluding the derivatives q \u0101[N\u0101 +nI ] from Eqs.

Namely, let us denote\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u0011\n1 \u0010\nF a * * * q b\u0304[Nb\u0304 +Na ] ; * * * u\u03bc1 [Na ] = Fa * * * q b[Nb +Na ] ; * * * u\u03bc[Na ] ,\n\u0012\nh\ni\u0013\n\u0001\na|I Na|I\n\u03bc1\n\u03bc\n, \u03bc1 = \u03bc, a|I .\nu = u ,***q\n\nThen the set (48) can be written as:\n\n\u0011\n1 \u0010\nF a * * * q b\u0304[Nb\u0304 +Na ] ; * * * u\u03bc1 [Na ] = 0 , a = (ak , k = 0, 1, ..., I \u2212 1) , Na < NI ,\n\n(49)\n\nwhere\n\n1\n\nF ak\n\n\uf8f1\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\uf8f2 Ma b\u0304 q b\u0304[Nb\u0304 +nk ] + K a * * * q b\u0304[Nb\u0304 +nk \u22121] ; * * * u\u03bc1 [nk ] , k = 1, ..., I \u2212 1\nk\nk\n\u0010\n\u0011\n.\n=\n\uf8f3\nM a0 * * * q b\u0304[Nb\u0304 ] ; u\u03bc1 = \u2202L/\u2202q a0\n\nHere q \u0101 are the inner coordinates, and u\u03bc1 are the external coordinates. The order of the\nset (49) is 2nI\u22121 . Furthermore, by virtue of (43), the matrix\n1 [nI\u22121 \u2212Na ]\n\u2202F a\n\n\u2202q b\u0304[Nb\u0304 +nI\u22121 ]\n10\n\n= Ma b\u0304\n\n(50)\n\n\fis invertible. Thus, the structure (15,16) is repeated completely.\nAt the same time, the number of the inner variables, the number of the equations, and\nthe order of the set (49) are less than those of the initial set of the ELE (15,16).\nNow, we apply the same procedure as in the first step to the reduced set (49). That\nwill be the second step of the reduction procedure. It will produce equations of similar\nstructure with less inner variables and of lower order. After the last (I + 1)-th step the\nELE (15) may be written in the following strong equivalent form:\n\u0010\n\u0011\nbj|k+ [nj +nk ]\nbj|k\u2212 [nj +nk \u22121]\nai|k\nai|k [ni +nk ]\n\u03bc[nk ]\nq\n=\u03c6\n***q\n,***q\n;***u\n, ,\nI \u2265 k+ \u2265 k + 1 , k \u2265 k\u2212 \u2265 0 , I \u2265 i, j \u2265 0 ,\n\n(51)\n\nwhere \u03c6ai|k are some LF of the indicated arguments (the arguments * * * q bj|k+ [nj +nk ] result\nfrom those coordinates that intermediately have been considered as external ones), and\nthe indices ai are divided into the following groups:\nX\u0002 \u0003 X\u0002 \u0003\n\u0001 \u0002 \u0003\nak|i = [ai ] , i, k = 0, 1, ..., I .\nai|k =\nai = ai|k , ai|k \u2265 0,\nk\n\nk\n\nThe set (51) is still not the canonical form of the ELE. The reason is that the right\nhand sides of the set contain derivatives of orders that may exceed the orders ni + nk of\nthe (highest) derivatives q ai|k [ni +nk ] appearing on the left hand side of the set. We recall\nthat by the definition in the canonical form there is a subordination of derivative orders,\nnamely, the orders of all the derivatives in the right hand sides have to be less than the\nones on the left hand side. Explicitly, this subordination would require that the following\ninequalities should hold:\nnj + nk+ > nj + nk ,\nnj + nk\u2212 > nj + nk \u2212 1 ,\nwhich, because of the inequalities nI > nI\u22121 > * * * n1 > n0 , is true for the first line and\nthe case k\u2212 = k of the second line, and it is definitely not true for the cases k\u2212 < k.\nArranging the equations (51) (for fixed value of i) in descending order w.r.t. k, and the\narguments in the functions \u03c6 (for fixed value of j) also in descending order w.r.t. the\nvalue of k+ and k\u2212 , we get, when disregarding the common value nj , a quadratic matrix\nwhose main diagonal (i.e. elements with k = k\u2212 ) contains the entries nk \u2212 1, whereas the\nentries to the left of that diagonal are equal to nk , and to the right of that diagonal are\nequal to nk \u2212 1. Therefore, below the main diagonal occur \"good\" derivatives, and above\nit occur \"bad\" derivatives not obeying the subordination requirement.\nSubordination procedure\n\nOne can see that these \"bad\" derivatives can be excluded from the right hand sides by\nthe help of corresponding \"lower\" equations of the set and their differential consequences\n(compare Eqs. (29) and (31) for the simple case I = 2). In what follows we call such an\nexclusion the subordination procedure.\nIn order to be more definite let us write down two arbitrary lines, l > k, of the right\nhand sides of the set of equations (51) (for the highest derivatives only):\n\u0001\n\u03c6ai|l q bj|I [nj +nl ] , ..., q bj|l+1 [nj +nl ] , q bj|l [nj +nl \u22121] , ..., q bj|k+1 [nj +nl \u22121] , q bj|k [nj +nl \u22121] , ..., q bj|0 [nj +nl \u22121] ,\n..\n.\n\u0001\n\u03c6ai|k q bj|I [nj +nk ] , ..., q bj|l+1 [nj +nk ] , q bj|l [nj +nk ] , ..., q bj|k+1 [nj +nk ] , q bj|k [nj +nk \u22121] , ..., q bj|0 [nj +nk \u22121] .\n11\n\n\fObviously, because nl > nk all the derivatives of the equation for q ai|l [ni +nl ] with\nk \u2265 l\u2212 \u2265 0 are \"bad\" with respect to the derivatives q ai|k [ni +nk ] (remind l \u2265 l\u2212 \u2265 0).\nHowever, these \"bad\" derivatives can be eliminated by the equations for the latter ones,\nq ai|k [ni +nk ] , and their differential consequences up to the order nl \u2212 nk \u2212 1. Thereby, the\nai|l\nfunction \u03c6ai|l changes into some new function \u03c6\u0303 . One can see that doing this we do\nnot change the highest orders of derivatives of the other coordinates, both proper and\nexternal ones, in the right hand side of the equation for q ai|l [ni +nl ] . (Remind, that the\nderivatives of the external coordinates are u\u03bc[nl ] and u\u03bc[nk ] , respectively.)\nThis subordination procedure, starting with l = I may be done for any k < I, thereby\n\"cleaning\" every entry on the right hand side of equations for q ai|I [ni +nI ] . Namely, the\nhighest orders of derivatives on the r.h.s. become q bj|k\u2212 [ni +nk\u2212 \u22121] with I \u2265 k\u2212 \u2265 0 (for\nthe case l = I no k+ appears). Then the procedure will be applied to the equations for\nq ai|I\u22121 [ni +nI\u22121 ] , and so forth, up to q ai|0 [ni +n0 ] , where nothing is to be changed.\nAfter having eliminated all the \"bad\" derivatives, we transformed the set (51), and\ntherefore the initial ELE, to the following strong equivalent (the equivalence is justified\nby the Lemma 1) canonical form\n\u0010\n\u0011\nq ai|k [ni +nk ] = \u03c6ai|k * * * q bj|k+ [nj +nk ] , * * * q bj|k\u2212 [nj +nk\u2212 \u22121] ; * * * u\u03bc[nk ] ,\nI \u2265 k+ \u2265 k + 1, k \u2265 k\u2212 \u2265 0, i, j, k = 0, 1, ..., I ,\n\nwhere \u03c6ai|k are some LF of the indicated arguments. This proves the Theorem 1.\nWe see that there are no gauge coordinates in\nP the nonsingular ELE.\nThe number of the initial data is equal to 2 a Na . Indeed,\n!\n!\nX\u0002 \u0003\nX\nX\nX\u0002 \u0003\nX\nX\u0002 \u0003\nNk\nai|k\n=2\nNa .\nai|k +\nai|k (Ni + Nk ) =\nNi\ni,k\n\ni\n\nk\n\nk\n\ni\n\na\n\nOne ought to remark that in the general case there exist many different canonical forms\nof the nonsingular ELE. This uncertainty is related to the possibility of different choices\nof nonzero minors of a matrix with a given rank (different divisions of the indices ai in\ncourse of the reduction procedure). However, as it was demonstrated above, the number\nof the equations in the canonical form (which is equal to the number of the ELE in the\nnonsingular case) and the number of the initial data is the same for all possible canonical\nforms.\n\n4\n\nCanonical form of singular ELE\n\nStudying the canonical form of nonsingular ELE, we have demonstrated that the equations\nin the canonical form are solved with respect to the highest-order derivatives q ai|k [ni +nk ] ,\nwhere ni are the proper orders of the coordinates q ai . However, considering specific\nexamples, one can see that this is not always true for singular ELE. Namely, in the\ncanonical form of the latter case, the highest orders of the derivatives q ai [l] may take on\nall the values from zero to ni + I . The reduction procedure to the canonical form for the\ngeneral singular ELE is considered below. In the singular case, already after the first step\nof the reduction procedure, the ELE cease to have their initial specific structure (15,16).\nNamely, the simple structure of terms with highest-order derivatives in the equations may\n12\n\n\fbe lost. That is why in the singular case it is more convenient to formulate the reduction\nprocedure for a more general set of ordinary differential equations, which contains the\nELE as a particular case. Namely, further we are going to consider a set of the form3 :\n\u0001\n(52)\nFA\u03bc * * * q ai [i+\u03bc] = 0 ; i = 0, 1, ..., I , \u03bc = 0, ..., J .\n\u0001\nHere FA\u03bc * * * q ai [i+\u03bc] are some LF. Via ai and A\u03bc are denoted sets of indices, [ai ] \u2265\n0, [A\u03bc ] \u2265 0 , and the complete set of the inner coordinates in Eqs. (52) is q a =\n(q a0 , ..., q aI ) , a = (ai , i = 0, 1, ..., I) . The indices A = (A\u03bc ) enumerate the equations.\nIn the general case the number of the indices A (the number of all the equations) is not\nequal to the number of the indices a (the number of the coordinates). The division of the\nindices A into the groups is not related to the division of the indices a into the groups.\nThe orders of the coordinates q ai in the complete set (52) are: Nai = i + J . In fact,\nthese orders are defined by a subset of (52) with \u03bc = J. In all the other equations with\n\u03bc < J the coordinates q ai have the orders less than i + J. Thus, the latter equations are\nconstraints.\nSimilar to the ELE (15), the set (52) has the following specific structure: In each\nequation of the set the order of a coordinate q ai is the sum of the proper order i and of\nthe order \u03bc. The latter is the same for all the coordinates and is related to the number\nof the equation in the set.\nBelow we consider the reduction procedure to the canonical form for the equations\n(52). In fact, this reduction procedure is formulated in the proof of the Theorem 2 given\nbelow. The Theorem 2 holds true under certain suppositions of the structure of the\nfunctions FA\u03bc . These suppositions are formulated as suppositions of the ranks of some\nJacobi matrices involving the functions FA\u03bc . First of all, the complete matrix\n[J\u2212\u03bc]\n\nMA\u03bc ai\n\n\u2202FA\u03bc\n\u2202FA\u03bc\n= a [i+J]\n,\n= a [i+\u03bc]\n\u2202q i\n\u2202q i\n\n(53)\n\nhas to have a constant rank in a vicinity of the consideration point (one can see that the\nmatrix MA\u03bc ai coincides with generalized Hessian matrix if the set (52) is the Lagrangian\none).\n\nTheorem 2:\n\nUnder certain suppositions of the ranks, the equations\n(52) can be transformed to the following equivalent canonical form:\nf\n\nai|\u03c3\n\n=q\n\nai|\u03c3 [i+\u03c3]\n\nai|\u03c3\n\n\u2212\u03c6\n\n\u0010\n\n***q\n\naj|\u03c3 \u2212 [j+\u03c3\u2212 \u22121]\n\n,***q\n\naj|\u03c3 + [j+\u03c3]\n\n\u0011\n\n= 0,\n\ni, j = 0, 1, ..., I , \u03c3 = \u2212I, ..., J , \u2212I \u2264 \u03c3 \u2212 \u2264 \u03c3 , \u03c3 + 1 \u2264 \u03c3 + \u2264 J + 1 ,\n\n(54)\n\nwhere all the indices a are divided into groups as follows:\n\u0001 \u0002 \u0003\nai = ai|\u03c3 , ai|\u03c3 \u2265 0 , \u03c3 = \u2212I, ..., J + 1,\n\n\u0002\n\n\u0003\n\u0001\nai|\u03c3 = 0 if i + \u03c3 < 0 ,\n\n(55)\n\nand it is\u0002thought\nthat negative powers of the time derivatives do not exist,\n\u0003\nthat is: q a[p] = 0 for p < 0.\n3\n\nWe do not indicate here possible external coordinates.\n\n13\n\n\fMoreover, the following equivalence between the corresponding LF holds\ntrue:\n\u0012\n\nf ai|\u03c3\n0G\n\n\u0013\n\n\u0001\n, A = ai|\u03c3 , G , i = 0, 1, ..., I , \u03c3 = \u2212I, ..., J ,\nX\u0002\n\u0003\nai|J+1 .\n0G \u2261 0 \u2200G , [G] = [A] \u2212 [a] +\nFA \u223c F\u0304A =\n\n(56)\n\ni\n\nThat implies\n\nFA = \u00dbAB F\u0304B , F\u0304B = V\u0302BA FA , \u00dbAB V\u0302BC = \u03b4C\nA,\n\n(57)\n\nwhere \u00db and V\u0302 are LO.\nLet us make some comments to the Theorem 2. The canonical form (54) of the singular\nELE differs from that (38) of the nonsingular ELE. As was demonstrated in the previous\nSect., in the latter case the spectrum of the orders of the variables q ai in the canonical\nform extends from i + \u03bcmin to i + J . In the singular case, we have to admit (and one\ncan see this on specific examples) the spectrum extends from 0 to i + J . Under such a\nsupposition we can justify by the induction the structure (54) of the canonical form. One\ncan see from (55) that each group of the indices ai is divided in subgroups ai \u2192 ai|\u03c3 ,\n\u03c3 = \u2212I, ..., J + 1. In the canonical form the singular\u0002 ELE\n\u0003 are solved with respect to the\nai|\u03c3 [i+\u03c3]\nhighest-order derivatives q\n, \u03c3 = \u2212I, ..., J , ( ai|\u03c3 = 0 for i + \u03c3 < 0). There are\nno equations for the coordinates q ai|J +1 . These coordinates enter the set (54) as arbitrary\nfunctions of time. They are gauge coordinates according to the general definition. As in\nthe nonsingular case, it is supposed that no coordinate q ak|\u03c3 in the function \u03c6ai|\u03c3 has an\norder greater than k + \u03c3 (the proper order plus \u03c3). Besides, the order of the coordinates\nq bk|\u03c3\u2212 in the function \u03c6ai|\u03c3 has to be less than k + \u03c3 \u2212 .\nWe are going to prove the Theorem 2 by induction w.r.t. N = I + J. To this end,\nwe consider first equations of lower orders, then we use an induction to prove the general\ncase.\n\n4.1\n\nEquations of lower orders\n\nRemark that the case N = 0 implies I = J = 0 and the set (52) is reduced to form\nFA (q) = 0, q = (q a ) .\n\n(58)\n\nHere the Theorem 2 holds true by virtue of the Lemma 3 from the Appendix.\nLet N = 1. That implies either I = 1, J = 0 or I = 0, J = 1 . Consider, for example,\nthe first case. Here (i = 0, 1, \u03bc = 0) and the set (52) reads\nFA (q a0 , q a1 , q\u0307 a1 ) = 0 , [a1 ] > 0, [a0 ] \u2265 0 .\n\n(59)\n\nIn the case under consideration the supposition (53) reads:\nrank\n\n\u2202FA\n= r.\n\u2202q ai [i]\n\na division of the indices:\n\u0002Then\u0003 there\n\u0002 exists\n\u0003\na0/1 + a0/1 = r, such that\n14\n\n(60)\n\n\u0001\n\u0001 \u0002 \u0003\nA = A/1 , A/2 , ai = ai/1 , ai/2 , A/1 =\n\n\fdet\n\n\u2202FA/1\n\u2202q ai/1 [i]\n\n6= 0 .\n\nThus, we may solve the equations FA/1 = 0 with respect to q ai/1 [i] ,\n\u0001\nFA/1 = 0 \u21d0\u21d2 q ai/1 [i] = \u03c6ai/1 q bi/1 [i\u22121] , q bi/2 [i\u22121] , q bi/2 [i] .\n\n(61)\n\nThen we exclude the arguments q ai/1 [i] from the functions FA/2 by the help of (61),\nF\u0304A/2 = FA/2\n\na\n[i]\na\nq i/1 =\u03c6 i/1\n\n= F\u0304A/2 (q a1 ) .\n\nBy virtue of the Lemma 2 from the Appendix, the functions F\u0304A/2 depend on q a1 only .\nThus, we have the equivalence4\n\u0013\n\u0012\nFA/1 (q a0 , q a1 , q\u0307 a1 )\n.\n(62)\nFA \u223c F\u0304A =\nF\u0304A/2 (q a1 )\nNow we suppose that the matrix \u2202 F\u0304A/2 /\u2202q a1 has a constant rank.

So, we end up\nexactly with Eq. (54) and the\n2 is proved.\n\u0002 Theorem\n\u0003\nIf the rank is less than AJ/1 then the above procedure is applied to the functions\nF\u0304AJ/1 . Doing that we lower the number of the equations that are not yet reduced to the\ncanonical form (the equations of the type F\u0304AJ/1 = 0 ). Remark that such a diminution\n\u0002\n\u0003\ndoes not happen at the first stage if AJ/2 = 0 . At a certain stage the procedure does\nnot lower the number of the above mentioned equations. This can happen when the rank\nof the matrix of the type (76) is maximal, i.e. is equal to the number of the functions of\nthe type F\u0304AJ/1 . In such a case we may reduce them to the canonical form as was said\nabove. This can also happen when we do not obtain the functions of the type F\u0304AJ/1 in the\nreduction procedure. That means that already at the previous step the set is reduced to\nthe case N = K \u2212 1, i.e. the possibility of the reduction to the canonical form is proved.\nFinally we stress that the reduction procedure is formulated for sets of equations of the\ntype (52) (the ELE are a particular case of such sets). The procedure holds true under\ncertain suppositions of ranks. These suppositions demand various Jacobi matrices of the\ntype \u2202Fs /\u2202q a[l] to have constant ranks in the vicinity of the consideration point. Here\nFs = 0 are equations obtained to a given stage of the procedure and q a[l] are highest-order\nderivatives in these equations. It is important to realize that proving the equivalence (56)\nwe prove at the same time the locality of the operators \u00db and V\u0302 from (57). In fact, the\nlatter proof is provided by the applicability of the Lemmas from the Appendix.\n\n18\n\n\f5\n\nGauge identities and action symmetries\n\nIt was demonstrated above that in the general case of singular ELE the number of the\nequations in the canonical form is less than the number of the equations in the initial set\nof the differential equations. This reduction is related to the fact that in the canonical\nform we retain the independent equations only, whereas the initial equations may be\ndependent. The dependence of the equations in the initial set may be treated as the\nexistence of some identities between the initial equations. The identities between the\nELE imply the existence of gauge transformations of the corresponding action. Below we\ndiscuss this interrelationship in detail.\nFirst, we introduce some relevant definitions: The relation of the form\nR\u0302a Fa \u2261 0 ,\n\n(77)\n\n\u0001\n[l]\n\nwhere R\u0302a are some\nare some LF, is called the identity between the\n\u0001 LO, and Fa q\n[l]\nequations Fa q = 0. The identity sign \u2261 means that the left hand side of (77) is zero\nfor any arguments\u0010 q [l]\u0011.\nAny set R\u0302 = R\u0302a of LO that obeys the relation (77) is called the generator of an\nidentity. Whenever R\u0302 is a generator than n\u0302R\u0302 with some LO n\u0302 is a generator as well. Any\nlinear combination n\u0302i R\u0302i of some generators R\u0302i with operator coefficients n\u0302i is a generator.\nA generator R\u0302 will be called nontrivial if the relation5 n\u0302R\u0302 = \u00d4 (F ) can only be provided\nby a LO n\u0302 of the form n\u0302 = \u00d4 (F ) .\nA set of generators R\u0302i will be called independent if the relation n\u0302i R\u0302i = \u00d4 (F ) can only\nbe provided by n\u0302i of the form n\u0302i = \u00d4 (F ) . Identities generated by independent generators\nwill be called independent.\nNote that for any\n\u0010 set\u0011of LF Fa , there always exist trivial generators. Namely, the\na\ngenerators R\u0302triv = R\u0302triv\n= \u00d4 (F ) of the form\na\nR\u0302triv\n=\n\nX\nk,l\n\n[k]\n\nFb ubk|al\n\ndl\n, ubk|al = \u2212ual|bk ,\ndtl\n\n(78)\n\nwith arbitrary antisymmetric LF ubk|al obviously lead to the identities (77). These identities are not, however, connected to the mutual dependence of the functions Fa .\nAn independent set of generators R\u0302g is complete whenever any generator R\u0302 can be\ng\ng\nrepresented in the form R\u0302 = \u03bb\u0302 R\u0302g + R\u0302triv with some LO \u03bb\u0302 . Any two complete sets of\n\u2032\nindependent generators R\u0302g and R\u0302\u2032g are related as R\u0302\u2032g = \u00dbgg R\u0302g\u2032 + R\u0302triv ,where \u00db is an\ninvertible LO.\nSupposing now that Fa in Eq. (77) are functional derivatives of an action, Fa = \u03b4S/\u03b4q a ,\nsuch that Fa = 0 are ELE. Let the functions Fa obey all the necessary suppositions of\nranks such that ELE can be reduced to the canonical form (54). Let us write here this\ncanonical form as follows6 ,\n\u0001\nf \u03b1 = q \u03b1[l\u03b1 ] \u2212 \u03c6\u03b1 * * * q \u03b1[l\u03b1 \u22121] ; * * * q g[lg ] = 0 , a = (\u03b1, g) ,\n(79)\n5\n\nBy \u00d4(F ) we denote LO of the form (3) with all the LF ukAa = O(F ) , where\nO(F )|F =0 = 0 .\n\n6\n\nHere, we do not distinguish possible different proper orders of the coordinates.\n\n19\n\n\fwhere q g are gauge coordinates. Moreover, according to the Theorem 2, there exists the\nequivalence\n\u0012 \u03b1 \u0013\nf\n=\u21d2 Fa = \u00dbab F\u0304b , F\u0304a = V\u0302ab Fb , \u00dbab V\u0302bc = \u03b4 ca ,\n(80)\nFa \u223c F\u0304a =\n0g\nwhere \u00db and V\u0302 are LO. Now we may consider the identity (77) as an equation for finding\nthe general form for the generator R\u0302 . Using (80) we transform this problem to the one\na\nfor finding the operators \u03be\u0302 ,\na\nb\n\u03be\u0302 F\u0304a \u2261 0 , R\u0302a = \u03be\u0302 V\u0302ba .\n(81)\n\u0010\n\u0011\na\n\u03b1\ng\nUsing the explicit form (80) of the functions F\u0304a , we get \u03be\u0302 = \u03be\u0302 \u03be\u0302\n, a = (\u03b1, g) ,\n\u03b1\n\nwhere \u03be\u0302 obey the equation\n\n\u03b1\n\n\u03be\u0302 f \u03b1 \u2261 0 ,\n\n(82)\n\ng\n\nand \u03be\u0302 is a set of arbitrary LO. Since the functions f have the canonical form (80), any\nsolution of the equation (82) is presented by trivial generators of the form\n\u0013\nk\nX \u0012 dl\n\u03b1\n\u03b1\n\u2032\n\u2032\nl\u03b1\u2032 |k\u03b1 d\n\u2032\n\u03be\u0302 = \u03be\u0302 triv =\nf\n, ul\u03b1 |k\u03b1 = \u2212uk\u03b1|l\u03b1 ,\n(83)\nu\n\u03b1\nl\nk\ndt\ndt\nk,l\n\u2032\n\nwhere ul\u03b1 |k\u03b1 are arbitrary\nLF. To demonstrate that we present the genPK antisymmetric\n\u03b1\n\u03b1\n\u03b1k k\n\u03b1k\nk\nare some LF.

Such a variable change is not singular. In terms of\nthe new variables, the equation (82) reads\nK\nX\n\n\u03be \u03b1k f\u03b1[k] = 0 , K < \u221e .\n\nk=0\n\nIts general solution is well known\nX [l] \u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\nf\u03b1\u2032 ul\u03b1 |k\u03b1 , ul\u03b1 |k\u03b1 = \u2212uk\u03b1|l\u03b1 .\n\u03be \u03b1k =\nl\n\nNow we can write the general solution of the equation (81) as:\nk\nX \u0012 dl \u0013\na\ng a\na\na\nlb|ka d\n\u03be\u0302 = \u03be\u0302 \u03b4 g + \u03be\u0302 triv , \u03be\u0302 triv =\nF\u0304\nu\n, ulb|ka = \u2212uka|lb .\nb\ndtl\ndtk\n\n(84)\n\nk,l\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\nLet b = (\u03b1\u2032 , g \u2032) , a = (\u03b1, g) in (84) .

The set of the generators R\u0302g = (R\u0302ga = V\u0302ga ) is\ncomplete and it is presented by LO. Moreover, these generators are independent. Indeed,\nmultiplying the equation n\u0302g R\u0302ga = \u00d4 (F ) from the right by \u00dbab , we get: n\u0302g \u03b4 bg = \u00d4 (F ) =\u21d2\nn\u0302g = \u00d4 (F ).\nThus, there exist the following nontrivial identities between the ELE:\nR\u0302ga\n\n\u03b4S\n\u2261 0 , g = 1, ..., r,\n\u03b4q a\n\n(86)\n\nwith generators R\u0302g that are LO. These identities are called the gauge identities. As is\nwell known (see for example, [2, 3]), the existence of the gauge identities (86) implies the\nexistence of infinitesimal gauge transformations of the form\n\u0010 \u0011a\n(87)\nq a \u2192 q a + \u03b4q a , \u03b4q a = R\u0302T \u01ebg ,\ng\n\nwhere r parameters \u01ebg = \u01ebg (t) are arbitrary functions of time t. Remark that R\u0302T are LO\nas well.\nThus, it was demonstrated that for theories that obey appropriate suppositions of\nthe ranks there exists a constructive procedure of revealing the gauge generators. For\nsuch theories all the generators are LO. The number of the independent generators and,\ntherefore, the number of the independent gauge transformations is equal to the number\nof the gauge coordinates in the ELE.\nAs a simple mechanical example, consider the action of the form7\nZ\n\u0001\na 2\n1\ny \u2212 x2 .\n(88)\nS = Ldt , L = (\u1e8b \u2212 y)2 +\n2\n2\nThe corresponding ELE are:\nF1 = \u1e8d \u2212 \u1e8f + ax = 0, F2 = \u1e8b \u2212 (1 + a) y = 0 ,\n\n(89)\n\nwhere F2 = 0 is a constraint.

In such a nonsingular case the reduction procedure looks as follows:\nBy the help of the consistency condition \u1e1e2 = 0 =\u21d2 \u1e8d = (1 + a) \u1e8f , we eliminate \u1e8d from\nthe first ELE.

The case is singular, M = 0 , and rank of the Hessian matrix is equal to 1 .\nOne can easily see that the equivalence\n\u0013\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0012\n0\n1\nd/dt 1\n\u1e8b \u2212 y\nF1\n\u22121\n, \u00db =\n, \u00db =\n= \u00db\n1 \u2212d/dt\n1\n0\n0\nF2\nholds true. Then the canonical form of the ELE reads \u1e8b = y and there is a gauge identity\nR\u0302a Fa \u2261 0 , R\u03021 = 1 , R\u03022 = \u2212d/dt .\n\u0010 \u0011a \u0012\u0010 \u00111\n\u0010 \u00112\na\nThe operators transposed to R\u0302 are R\u0302T =\nR\u0302T = 1, R\u0302T =\n\nd\ndt\n\n\u0013\n\n. Thus, at a = 0,\n\nthe action (88) is invariant under the gauge transformation x \u2192 x + \u01eb , y \u2192 y + \u01eb\u0307 . In the\ncase under consideration, the ELE have two canonical forms: \u1e8b = y and y = \u1e8b .\n\n6\n\nConcluding remarks\n\nWe have formulated the reduction procedure which allows one to transform the ELE to\nthe canonical form as well as to establish possible gauge identities between the equations.\nThe latter part of the procedure can be considered as a constructive way of finding all\nthe gauge generators within the Lagrangian formulation. At the same time, it is proven\nthat, for local theories, all the gauge generators are local in time operators. The canonical\nform of the ELE reveals their hidden structure, in particular, it presents the spectrum of\npossible initial data, and it allows one to separate coordinates into nongauge and gauge\nones. One ought also to remark that the reduction procedure can be, in particular, treated\nas a procedure of finding constraints in the Lagrangian formulation.\nIn that respect one can compare the reduction procedure with the well-known Dirac\nprocedure in the Hamiltonian formulation of constrained systems [1, 2, 3]. Recall that\nthe Dirac procedure is applicable to the Hamilton equations with primary constraints,\nnamely to equations of the form\n\b\nF (\u03b7, \u03b7\u0307) = \u03b7\u0307 \u2212 \u03b7 , H (1) = 0 , \u03a6(1) (\u03b7) = 0 , H (1) = H (\u03b7) + \u03bb\u03a6(1) (\u03b7) .\n(93)\n\nHere \u03b7 = (q a , pa ) are phase-space variables; \u03a6(1) (\u03b7) = 0 are primary constraints, \u03bb's are\nLagrange multipliers to the primary constraints, and H (1) is the total Hamiltonian . Via\n{*, *} the Poisson bracket is denoted. The aim of the procedure is to eliminate as many as\npossible \u03bb's from the equations, to find all the constraints in the theory. The procedure is\nbased on the consistency conditions \u03a6\u0307(1) = 0. Using the equations F (\u03b7, \u03b7\u0307) = 0, we may\ntransform any consistency condition to the following form:\n\b\n\u03a6\u0307(1) = \u03a6(1) , H (1) = 0 .\nFrom these equations one can define some \u03bb's as functions of \u03b7 and reveal some new\nconstraints. Then the procedure has to be applied to the latter constraints and so on.\nThe equations (93) present a particular case of differential equations considered in\nthe present article (indeed, these equations are ELE for a Hamiltonian action). Thus,\n22\n\n\four reduction procedure may be applied to these equations. Namely, first one has to\nconsider the equations FA = 0, \u03a6\u0307(1) = 0 and select independent w.r.t. \u03b7\u0307 equations. Since\nequations of the primary constraints are independent by construction, we pass to the next\nstep and solve the constraint equations \u03a6(1) = 0 with respect to a part of the variables \u03b7,\nas \u03a6(1) = 0 \u2192 \u03b7 1 \u2212 \u03c61 (\u03b7 2 ) = 0. Then we exclude \u03b71 and \u03b7\u0307 1 from the equations F = 0.\nThus, we get F = 0 \u2192 F\u0304A (\u03b7 2 , \u03b7\u0307 2 ) = 0. Then one has to select independent w.r.t. \u03b7\u0307 2\nfunctions F\u0304A/1 . At the same time one finds new constraints F\u0304A/2 (\u03b7 2 ) = 0 and so on (see\nthe Subsect. \"First order equations\").\nWe see that the Dirac procedure differs from our reduction procedure. Indeed, as was\nmentioned above, in the Dirac procedure one excludes all the derivatives \u03b7\u0307 by the help of\nthe equations F = 0 from the consistency conditions \u03a6\u0307(1) = 0. Thus, one gets equations\nfor the Lagrange multipliers and new constraints. Besides, one of the aim of the Dirac\nprocedure is to maintain the canonical Hamiltonian structure of the equations F = 0. The\npossibility of the Dirac reduction is due to the specific structure of the equations (93).\nNamely, here the consistency conditions never involve \u03bb\u0307 and rank \u2202F/\u2202 \u03b7\u0307 = [F ] = [\u03b7].\nBesides, one ought to mention the work [14] where it was proposed an alternative (to\nthe Dirac procedure)\nR \u0002 way ofA reducing\u0003 the equations of motion for theories with actions\n\u03c6A (\u03b7) \u03b7\u0307 \u2212 V (\u03b7) dt . One can verify that, in fact, the procedure of\nof the form S =\nthat work, in a part (the procedure does not reveal the gauge identities), is similar to our\nreduction procedure in the case of the first order equations (see Sect. IV).\nHowever, the reduction procedure proposed in the present article is formulated for a\nwider class of Lagrangian systems (differential equations). It does not need the introduction of new variables such as momenta and Lagrange multipliers, and it is defined\nin the framework of the initial Lagrangian formulation. Moreover, its aim is twofold: to\nreduce ELE to their canonical form and to reveal the gauge identities between the ELE\nequations.\nThe consideration in the present article is restricted by finite-dimensional systems. Its\napplication to field theories (theories with infinite number degrees of freedom) demands\nadditional study. We hope to present the corresponding formulation in futures publications. However, in simple cases, one can apply the present reduction procedure with\nsome naturalRmodifications in the infinite-dimensional case. Consider the Maxwell action\nS = \u2212 (1/4) F\u03bc\u03bd F \u03bc\u03bd dx , F\u03bc\u03bd = \u2202\u03bc A\u03bd \u2212 \u2202\u03bd A\u03bc as a common example of a singular field\ntheory. The ELE read:\n\u2202S\n= \u2202\u03bd F i\u03bd = \u00c4i + \u2202i \u02260 \u2212 \u25b3Ai + \u2202i \u03c6 = 0 ,\n\u2202Ai\n\u2202S\n= \u2212 0 = \u2202\u03bd F \u03bd0 = \u03c6\u0307 + \u25b3A0 = 0 , \u03c6 = \u2202k Ak .\n\u2202A\n\nFi =\n\n(94)\n\nF0\n\n(95)\n\nThe equation F0 = 0 is a constraint. Following the reduction procedure, we have to\nconsider the set Fi = 0 , \u1e1e0 = 0 . The Jacobi matrix \u2202F \u03bc /\u2202 \u00c4\u03bd has the constant rank\n3. We can, for example, select the equations (94) as independent with respect to the\nderivatives \u00c4i . The equation \u1e1e0 = 0 is their consequence. No more constraints appear.\nNow we exclude A0 and \u02260 from (94) by the help of (95). That creates the equivalence\n\u0012 i \u0013 \u0012 i\n\u0013\u0012 k \u0013\ni \u22020\n\u0001\n\u03b4 k \u2212 \u2202\u25b3\nF\nF\u0304\n=\n, F\u0304 k = F k F 0 =0 = \u0003 Ak + \u2202k \u03c6 .\n(96)\n0\n0\nF\nF\n0\n1\n23\n\n\fNow we discover that the functions F\u0304 k are dependent, \u2202k F\u0304 k \u2261 0. In our terms that reads,\nfor example, as the following equivalence\n\uf8f6\uf8eb 1 \uf8f6\n\uf8eb 1 \uf8f6 \uf8eb\n1\n0\n0\nF\u0304\nF\u0304\n\uf8f8\n\uf8ed\n\uf8ed F\u0304 2 \uf8f8 = \uf8ed\nF\u0304 2 \uf8f8 .\n0\n1\n0\n(97)\n\u22121\n\u22121\n3\n0\nF\u0304\n\u2212\u22023 \u22021 \u2212\u22023 \u22022 1\nThe equations F\u0304 1 = 0, F\u0304 2 = 0, F 0 = 0 present one of the canonical forms of the Maxwell\nequations. The identity that follows from the presence of the zero in the right column of\n(97) reads as \u2202\u03bc F \u03bc = 0 in terms of the initial functions F \u03bc and implies the invariance of\nthe Maxwell action under gradient gauge transformations.\n\nAcknowledgement 1 B.

In this respect it is useful to recall here the relevant\ndefinitions from the Sect. II . Namely:\n\u0001\n\u0001\nTwo sets of equations, FA q [l] = 0 and f\u03b1 q [l] = 0 are equivalent F \u0001= 0 \u21d0\u21d2 f =\u0001 0\nwhenever they have the same set of solutions. If two sets of LF FA q [l] and \u03c7A q [l] ,\n[F ] = [\u03c7] , are related by some LO \u00db and V\u0302 as F = \u00db\u03c7 , \u03c7 = V\u0302 F , \u00db V\u0302 = 1 , then we\ncall such LF equivalent and denote this fact as: F \u223c \u03c7 . In this case the corresponding\nequations are strongly equivalent.\nLemma 1\nLet a set of equations\n\u0001\n\u03a6\u03bc x, y [l] = 0 , Fa (x, y) = 0 , x = (x\u03bc ) , y = (y a ) ,\n\n(98)\n\nbe given, where \u03a6 are some LF. And let det \u2202Fa /\u2202y b x0 ,y0 6= 0, where the consideration\npoint (x0 , y0) is on shell. Then:\na) The equations Fa (x, y) = 0 can be solved w.r.t. y as: y a = \u03c6a (x) , where \u03c6a (x) are\nsome single-valued functions of x in the vicinity of the point x0 . In other words, there is\nthe equivalence\nFa (x, y) \u223c y a \u2212 \u03c6a (x) ,\n(99)\nwhich implies the strong equivalence between the equations Fa (x, y) = 0 and y a = \u03c6a (x) .\nb) The following equivalence between the LF holds true:\n\u0012\n\u0001 \u0013 \u0012\n\u0001 \u0013\n\u03a6\u03bc x, y [l]\n\u03a6\u0304\u03bc x[l]\n(100)\n\u223c\n, \u03a6\u0304\u03bc = \u03a6\u03bc |y[l] =\u03c6[l] .\nFa (x, y)\ny a \u2212 \u03c6a (x)\n\n24\n\n\fThe first statement is, in fact, the well-known implicit function theorem [13]. Taking\ninto account (99), we have: Fa (x, y) = uab (y a \u2212 \u03c6a (x)) , det u|x0 ,y0 6= 0. On the other\nside one can write \u03a6\u03bc = \u03a6\u0304\u03bc + V\u0302\u03bca [y a \u2212 \u03c6a (x)] , where V\u0302Aa is a LO.
