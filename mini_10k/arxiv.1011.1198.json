During these collisions a\nfraction of the gravitational binding\u2013energy of massive Dark\nMatter halos can be channelled into shocks and turbulence\nthat may accelerate relativistic protons and electrons (e.g.\nRyu et al 2003; Cassano & Brunetti 2005; Brunetti & Lazarian 2007; Hoeft & Br\u00fcggen 2007; Pfrommer et al 2008; Skillman et al 2008; Vazza et al 2009), while collisions between\nthe accelerated protons and the thermal protons generate\nsecondary particles (e.g. Blasi & Colafrancesco 1999; Pfrommer & Ensslin 2004). This makes galaxy clusters unique laboratories to study particle acceleration in diluted astrophysical plasma.\nRadio observations of galaxy clusters probe these complex\nprocesses through the study of cluster\u2013scale synchrotron\nemission generated by relativistic electrons that gyrate in\nthe magnetic fields of the IGM. Giant radio halos are the\nmost spectacular, and best studied, examples of cluster\u2013\nc 0000 RAS\n\nscale synchrotron sources. They are steep\u2013spectrum, low\nbrightness diffuse emissions that extend similarly to the hot\nX\u2013ray emitting gas (eg. Ferrari et al 2008 for a review) and\nthat are found in merging clusters (eg. Cassano et al 2010\nand ref therein). The morphological and spectral properties\nof a number of radio halos suggest that the emitting electrons are accelerated by spatially distributed and \"gentle\"\n(i.e. poorly efficient, with acceleration time \u223c 108 yrs) mechanisms (e.g. Brunetti et al 2008).\nA model put forward for the origin of giant radio halos\nassumes that relativistic particles in the IGM are reaccelerated by MHD turbulence that is generated during massive\ncluster\u2013cluster mergers (e.g. Brunetti et al. 2001, 2004; Petrosian 2001; Fujita et al 2003; Cassano & Brunetti 2005).\nThe theory of MHD turbulence seriously advanced in the\nlast decades (see Cho, Lazarain & Vishniac 2003 for a review), affecting our view of particle acceleration in astrophysical plasmas (e.g. Chandran 2000; Yan & Lazarian 2002;\n2004, 2008). Recently (Brunetti & Lazarian 2007, 2010) we\n\n\f2\n\nG. Brunetti, A. Lazarian\n\nconsidered these advances to develop a comprehensive picture of turbulence in the IGM and to study stochastic reacceleration of relativistic particles. We suggested that compressible MHD turbulence (essentially fast modes), generated during energetic cluster\u2013mergers, provides the most\nimportant driver of stochastic particle reacceleration in the\nIGM, and that the interaction between this turbulence and\nthe relativistic electrons may explain the origin of radio halos, provided that a fraction (10-25 %) of the energy dissipated during mergers is channelled into these modes.\nTo what extend these calculations were accurate depends on\nour understanding of the properties of IGM turbulence. The\ninteraction between fast modes and both the thermal IGM\nand the relativistic particles was assumed collisionless, in\nwhich case about 90 percent of the energy of fast modes goes\ninto heating of the thermal plasma, while only 10 percent is\navailable for the reacceleration of relativistic particles (eg.\nBrunetti & Lazarian 2007); in the following we refer to this\nassumption as collisionless IGM.\nOn the other hand one may think about a different picture. Indeed it can be argued that the degree of collisionality of astrophysical plasmas is underestimated when only\nColoumb collisions are taken into account (eg. Lazarian et al\n2010). Instabilities are naturally generated into the IGM (eg.\nSchekochihin et al 2005) and make the fluid more collisional,\nin which case a larger fraction of the energy of compressible\nMHD turbulence may become available for the reacceleration of relativistic particles.\nAt the same time the maximum energy budget available for\ncosmic rays in the IGM can be efficiently constrained from\nthe recent upper limits to the gamma ray emission from\nnearby galaxy clusters (eg. Aharonian et al. 2009; Ackermann et al 2010) and to the Mpc-scale radio emission in\nclusters without radio halos (eg. Brunetti et al 2007), and\nthis provide important information for theoretical models.\nConsequently in this paper we explore the process of\nparticle reacceleration by compressible turbulence in the\nIGM by assuming a picture of turbulence different from\nthat considered in previous studies. According to this picture\nplasma instabilities are naturally generated in the IGM and\ndecrease the effective collisional scale of the thermal IGM\nmaking the interaction between turbulence and the thermal\nplasma more collisional.\nIn Sect. 2 we discuss the properties of MHD turbulence and\nthe effect of reduced mean free path in determining the way\nthe IGM interacts with turbulence. In Sect.3 we discuss consequences of a reduced mean free path in the IGM on turbulence damping and on the reacceleration of relativistic\nparticles; in Sect.4 we report on the case of the reacceleration of relativistic protons and of secondary electrons. In\nSect.5 and 6 we provide a more general discussion and our\nconclusions, respectively.\n\n2\n2.1\n\nTURBULENCE IN GALAXY CLUSTERS\nEffective collisionality of the IGM\n\nIt is well known that the mean free path of thermal protons\ndue to Coulomb collisions in the hot IGM is very large, ten\nto hundred kpc (e.g. Sarazin 1986). Fluids in such a collisionless regime can be very different from their collisional\n\ncounterparts (Schekochihin et al. 2005; 2010). Several instabilities (e.g. firehose, mirror, gyroresonance etc.) can be\ngenerated in the IGM in the presence of turbulence, leading to a transfer of the energy of large-scale compressions to\nperturbations on smaller scales.\nMany instabilities have growth rate which peaks at\nscales near the particle gyroradius, making very large the\nscale separation between the energy injection scale and the\nscale where this energy is being deposited. On one hand\nscatterings induced by instabilities dramatically reduce the\neffective mean free path of thermal ions (e.g. Schekochihin &\nCowley 2006) decreasing the effective viscosity of the IGM,\nat the same time these scatterings may change the effective collisionality of the plasma. Indeed, the usual notion of\ncollisions in plasmas assumes Coulomb collisions. However,\ncharged particles can be randomized if they interact with\nperturbed magnetic field. If this field is a result of plasma\ninstabilities, the process can be viewed as the collective interaction of an individual ion with the rest of the plasma,\nwhich is the process mediated by magnetic field. As a result, the fluid would behave as collisional on scales less that\nthe Coulomb mean free path. This issue has been addressed\nin Lazarian & Beresnyak (2006) for the case of a collisionless\nfluid subject to the gyroresonance instability that is driven\nby the anisotropy of the particle distribution in the momentum space that arises from magnetic field compression;\nthe larger the magnetic field compression, the higher the\nanisotropy induced and the higher is the instability growth\nrate. They found that the turbulent magnetic compressions\non the scale of the mean free path and less are the most effective for inducing the instability? . As the scattering happens\non magnetic perturbations induced by the instability, the\nmean free path of particles decreases as a result of the operation of the instability. This results in the process being\nself-regulating, i.e. the stronger the turbulence at the scale\nof injection, the smaller is the mean free path of plasma particles and the larger is the span of scales over which the fluid\nbehaves as essentially collisional.\nGiven these general considerations, in the following we shall\nassume that the interaction between the turbulent modes\nand the thermal IGM is similar to that of collisional fluids\non scales which are less than the Coulomb mean free path but\nlarger than the mean free path arising from particle scattering by magnetic perturbations driven by instabilities; in the\nfollowing we refer to this assumption as collisional IGM.\n\n2.2\n\nThe turbulent picture in the IGM\n\nAt large scales turbulence in the IGM is likely superAlfvenic, the injection velocity VL being substantially\ngreater that the Alfven velocity vA , in this case turbulence\nin the IGM behaves as hydro\u2013turbulence (see Lazarian 2006,\nBrunetti & Lazarian 2007). In the Kolmogorov cascade the\nturbulent velocity Vl scales as VL (l/Lo )1/3 , and at scales\nless than the transitional scale, lA \u223c Lo (VL /vA )\u22123 , turbulence gets sub-Alfvenic and obeys the MHD turbulence relations (see Goldreich & Srindhar 1995, and also Lazarian &\n? The larger scale compressions do still induce the instability, but\ntheir effect is reduced due to their reduced ability to induce large\nchanges of B over the time scale between scattering.\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n\fParticle reacceleration by compressible turbulence in galaxy clusters: effects of reduced mean free path\nVishniac 1999, Cho & Lazarian 2003)\u2020 down to collisionless\nscales. Note, that for the IGM the scale of the transition is\nlA \u223c 0.1 \u2212 1 kpc (e.g. Brunetti & Lazarian 2007).\nIn the range of scales where the interaction between turbulence and the thermal IGM is collisional the most important\ndamping of turbulent motions is due to relativistic particles.\nThis is particularly important for fast modes (Brunetti &\nLazarian 2007), while it is well known that the damping of\nsolenoidal and slow modes components of the turbulence is\nmuch less efficient, at least at relatively large scales (e.g.\nYan & Lazarian 2004). In the MHD\u2013 regime, l \u2264 lA , MHD\nnumerical simulations have shown that a solenoidal turbulent forcing gets the ratio between the amplitude of Alfv\u00e9n\n\u2248 \u03b4Vs and fast \u2248 \u03b4Vc modes in the form (Cho & Lazarian\n2003) :\n(\u03b4V )2c\n(\u03b4V )s vA\n\u223c 2\n2\n(\u03b4V )2s\ncs + vA\n\n(1)\n\nwhich essentially means that coupling between these two\nmodes is inefficient at the sufficiently small scales where the\nperturbations are sub-Alfvenic. This allows us to talk about\nseparate cascades of fast, slow and Alfven modes in agreement with the simulations which performed mode separation\nand studied those cascades (Cho & Lazarian 2003, Kowal &\nLazarian 2010).\nConsequently we can assume that in the clusters of galaxies the energy transported by the cascade of fast modes is\nmainly channelled into the reacceleration of relativistic particles, while the compressions of magnetic field arising from\nslow modes transports the energy from large to small collisionless scales, sustaining the generation of the same compressible instabilities that increase the effective collisionality of the thermal IGM at scales smaller than the Coulomb\nscale. In this respect, to provide a more quantitative view\nof our picture as an example we adopt the reference case of\nfirehose instability (e.g. Chandrasekhar et al. 1958; Barnes\n1966). The threshold condition for the instability to occur\nwith thermal electrons is \u03b4Tk /T > 1/\u03b2pl so that this instability is expected to naturally develop in high beta plasmas, like\nthe IGM. The cascading slow modes compress the plasma\nalong the field lines generating anisotropies (due to conservation of adiabatic invariant) in the phase\u2013distribution of\nthermal particles and potentially may drive firehose instability in the IGM.

Under these\nconditions fast modes can be assumed isotropic (e.g. Cho &\nLazarian 2003) with quasi\u2013stationary spectrum (Brunetti &\nLazarian 2007, 2010) :\n\n\u0001 12\n\nW f (k) \u2248 cw Iof \u03c1hVph i\n\n3\n\nk\u2212 2\n\n(3)\n\nfor ko < k < kc , where cw is of the order of unity and kc is\nthe cut\u2013off scale where collisionless dampings become more\nefficient than the process of wave\u2013wave cascading.\nUnder the hypothesis discussed in the previous Section, the\nmost important collisionless damping of fast modes is due to\nthe Transit-Time-Damping (TTD) resonance with relativistic particles (eg. Schlickeiser & Miller 1998; Yan & Lazarian\n2004; Brunetti & Lazarian 2007, 2010):\n\u0393CR\n\n\u03c0 2 |Bk |2 sin2 \u03b8 c2s\ni\n\u2248 \u2212 kh\n8\nW f | cos \u03b8| Bo2\n\nZ\n\np4 dp\n\n\u2202f (p)\n\u2202p\n\n(4)\n\nwhere Bo is the background (unperturbed) magnetic field,\ncs is the sound speed and |Bk |2 /W f is the ratio between\nmagnetic field fluctuations and total energy in the mode\n(the quantity h..i indicates average with respect to the angle\nbetween mode wavenumber and the background magnetic\nfield).

The particle\u2013diffusion\ncoefficient in the momentum space due to TTD is obtained\ncombining e.g. Eq. 47 in Brunetti & Lazarian (2007) and\nEq. 5 :\n1/2\n\nDpp ' 2cw ck P\ne,p\n\nR\n\np2 Iof\ndpp2 c \u2202N\n\u2212 2N\n\u2202p\np\n\n(6)\n\nwhere, assuming Iof \u03c6\u03c4 >> \u000foCR (\u000foCR the initial energy density of cosmic rays), it is\u00b6 :\n\nZ\n\ndpp2 c\n\n\u2202N\nN\n\u22122\n\u223c cN \u000fCR \u223c Iof \u03c6cN \u03c4\n\u2202p\np\n\n(7)\n\n\u00a7 provided that kc \u2264 k\ncoll , kcoll being the wavenumber where\nthe IGM becomes collisionless\n\u00b6 we assume that damping is dominated by a single species of\nrelativistic particles\n\n3\n\n\f4\n\nG.

Under these conditions relativistic protons rapidly gain energy\nwith the consequence that the damping of the turbulent\nmodes by these protons increases with time and makes the\nreacceleration process less efficient. After few acceleration\ntimes, as soon as \u000fCR \u223c Iof \u03c4 , we expect that the process\napproaches a \"asymptotic\", universal, regime that does not\ndepend on initial conditions (provided that the injection rate\nof turbulence is constant).

Red lines show a case of intermittent turbulence\nwhere we assume \u000foCR = 0.03\u000fth and, for simplicity, we assume\nthat the turbulent energy varies with time 0.25 \u00d7 (VL /cs )2 and\n(VL /cs )2 (same line\u2013code given above). All calculations assume\na spectral index of cosmic rays \u03b4 = 2.6, a IGM number density\nnth = 7 * 10\u22124 cm\u22123 and temperature T = 108 K.\n\ncN is a numerical factor that depends on the shape of the\nspectrum of the accelerated particlesk . \u03c6 accounts for the\n\"intermittent\" nature of the turbulence\u2013injection process\n(i.e., Iof \u03c6\u03c4 is the energy density injected into fast modes in\nthe period of time \u03c4 ), we indeed expect that many patches\nof large\u2013scale turbulence can be injected at different times\nin a Mpc3 region during a merger.\nFrom Eqs.6 and 7 the process of particle reacceleration is\nself\u2013regulated by the damping of the modes due to the reaccelerated particles.\nThis is a new regime of particle reacceleration by compressible turbulence. Indeed it greatly differs from the case of a\ncollisionless IGM, where the damping of the modes is dominated by the collisionless damping with the thermal electrons in the IGM (e.g. Cassano & Brunetti 2005; Brunetti\n& Lazarian 2007, 2010). On the other hand, a similar effect,\nthe proton\u2013wave boiler, was observed in the case of reacceleration by a hypothetical spectrum of isotropic Alfvenic waves\n(Brunetti et al 2004) where indeed the damping of the modes\nwas dominated by gyro\u2013resonance with relativistic protons.\nAccording to Eqs. 6 and 7 we can identify two asymptotic\nregimes of reacceleration (\u03c6 = 1 for simplicity) : (i) a fast\nregime for Iof \u03c4f \u223c \u03c1VL2 >> \u000foCR , where \u03c4f is the cascading\ntime of fast modes injected at large scales, and (ii) a slow\nregime for Iof \u03c4f << \u000foCR .\nIn the fast regime the damping due to relativistic particles is\nk for instance c = (s + 2) assuming N (p) \u221d p\u2212s\nN\n\ncw ck\n\u03c4 \u22121\ncN \u03c6\n\n(8)\n\ni.e. the reacceleration efficiency approaches a universal behaviour and decreases (linearly) with time.\nOn the other hand, in the slow regime relativistic protons\ndo not increase significantly their energy implying a quasi\u2013\nconstant damping of the modes; in this case Dpp \u221d Iof .\nAll these effects can be seen in Figure 1, where we report the evolution with time of the systematic reacceleration\ntime, \u03c4acc = p2 /(4Dpp ), assuming different initial values of\nIof \u03c4f /\u000foCR (for simplicity the thermal energy density and Iof\nare assumed constant with time). For small \u03c1VL2 /\u000foCR we\nare in the slow regime where the acceleration time does not\nchange significantly with time. On the other hand, for large\n\u03c1VL2 /\u000foCR , we are in the fast regime where initially the acceleration time rapidly increases and then approaches the\n\"asymptotic\" behaviour at later stages. By adopting a more\nrealistic picture where both the thermal energy density of\nthe IGM and Iof may increase with time during a merger,\nor where turbulence is intermittent (Fig. 1) we expect a less\nrapid approach to this \"asymptotic\" behaviour.\nWe believe that the most important consequence of this\nnew regime of particle reacceleration by compressible turbulence is the universal acceleration time\u2013scale, \u223c 108 yrs,\nthat occurs when turbulence and cosmic rays reach approximate equipartition.\n\n4\n\nREACCELERATION OF PROTONS AND\nSECONDARY ELECTRONS\n\nAs an example we calculate the evolution with time of the\nspectrum of relativistic electrons and protons subject to\nreacceleration by fast modes assuming a collisional IGM. As\na simplification we consider only primary protons and the\nsecondary electrons produced by inelastic collisions between\nthese protons and the IGM. In this case the damping of the\nmodes is largely dominated by that with relativistic protons.\nThis also allows for a prompt comparison with similar calculations developed under the assumption of collisionless IGM\n(Brunetti & Lazarian 2010).\nWe model the time evolution of the spectral energy distribution of electrons, Ne , with an isotropic Fokker-Planck equation :\n\u2202Ne (p, t)\n\u2202\ndp\n1 \u2202 2\n=\nNe (p, t)\n\u2212 2\n(p Dpp )\n\u2202t\n\u2202p\ndt r\np \u2202p\n\u0011i\ndp\n\u22022\n+\n+ 2 [Dpp Ne (p, t)]\ndt i\n\u2202p\n\nh\n\n\u0010\n\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n\fParticle reacceleration by compressible turbulence in galaxy clusters: effects of reduced mean free path\n\nFigure 2.

Relativistic protons do not experience relevant\nenergy losses in the IGM and TTD resonance in the IGM\nmay reaccelerate supra-thermal protons up to high energies.\nOn the other hand, the case of electrons is more complex.\nRadiative losses (due to synchrotron and inverse Compton\nemission) experienced by relativistic electrons in the IGM\nare expected to prevent an efficient reacceleration of these\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\nparticles above a maximum energy, \u03b3max . Consequently, at\nhigher energies the evolution of the electron spectrum is basically driven by the process of injection of fresh electrons\ndue to p\u2013p collisions (and on its interplay with radiative\nlosses).\nResults are reported in Figure 2. Calculations are carried\nout considering that cosmic ray protons contribute to a few\npercent of the thermal cluster energy, consistent with the\nrecent limits derived from FERMI observations of nearby\nclusters (Aharonian et al. 2009; Ackermann et al 2010). Under the hypothesis of collisional IGM, the bulk of turbulence\n(fast modes) is channelled into reacceleration of cosmic rays\nand the FERMI limits put corresponding constraints also on\nthe energy density of turbulent motions in the IGM, about\n(VL /cs )2 \u2264 10%. Fig. 2 shows that relativistic (secondary)\nelectrons can be reaccelerated at energies of several GeV\neven by assuming that fast modes contribute to only a few\npercent of the energy density of the IGM. On the other hand\na larger amount of compressible turbulence is typically requested assuming a collisionless IGM (e.g. Brunetti & Lazarian 2010 and ref therein). This however does not imply that\nrelativistic electrons can be reaccelerated for long periods\nat energies much larger than those in the collisionless case.\nIndeed larger injection rates of turbulence do not make the\nreacceleration process substantially more efficient, due to\nthe damping by the relativistic protons that self-regulates\nthe acceleration efficiency in a few acceleration times. The\neffect of damping is also visible in Figure 2 : at later stages\nthe acceleration of cosmic rays starts to saturate.\nIt is important ti stress that self-regulation depends on\nIof \u03c6\u03c4 /\u000fCR , thus the effect of proton back\u2013reaction on the\nacceleration efficiency becomes less important in the (more\n\n5\n\n\f6\n\nG. Brunetti, A. Lazarian\n\nrealistic) case of intermittent (or patchy) turbulence (\u03c6 < 1,\nFig. 2) that implies that less energy in channelled into cosmic ray protons; in this case larger acceleration efficiencies\nare maintained for longer periods of time (see also Fig. 1).\n\nwhere fslow is the ratio of the energy of slow and fast\nmodes.

Consequently the way compressible turbulence is\ndamped and particle are reaccelerated in the IGM depends\non the interplay between several reference scales (wavenumbers): the collisionless scale, kcoll , the Coulomb scale, kC , the\nturbulence cut\u2013off scale due to collisionless damping with\nthermal particles, kcth , and that due to collisionless damping\nwith relativistic particles, kcCR (Figure 3 for a sketch of both\ncollisional and collisionless cases).\nThe cut\u2013off scale due to collisionless damping with thermal particles is (Brunetti & Lazarian 2007) :\nkcth \u223c C th ko\n\n\u0010\n\nVL\ncs\n\n\u00114\n\n(11)\n\n(C th is a constant) while that due to collisionless damping\nwith relativistic particles (from Eqs.4 and 5) is :\nkcCR \u223c C CR ko\n\n\u0010\n\nVL\ncs\n\n\u00114 \u0010\n\n\u000fCR\ncs\n\u000fth\n\n\u0011\u22122\n\n(12)\n\n(C CR is a constant) where kcCR >> kcth in the IGM (Brunetti\n& Lazarian 2007).\nThe typical spatial scale of the collisionless (TTD) thermal\nV 2 /c2\n\n(kpc)\ndamping is fairly large, 1/kcth \u223c 0.1 \u2212 1 \u00d7 Lo300\n( L0.3 s )\u22122\nkpc (Brunetti & Lazarian 2007). Consequently it is reasonable to assume that plasma instabilities driven by compressible turbulence (even considering a modest level of turbulence) may maintain the IGM at least weakly\u2013collisionless,\nwith kcCR > kcoll >> kcth , allowing for an increasing fraction of turbulence to become available for reacceleration of\nrelativistic particles with respect to the case of collisionless\nIGM. In this regime the damping of turbulence is collisional\n(as in Sect. 4) at scales larger than \u223c 1/kcoll , whereas the\ncascade of fast modes is suddenly interrupted by collisionless TTD with thermal electrons as soon as 1/k \u2264 1/kcoll . In\nthis regime the momentum\u2013diffusion coefficient of relativistic particles subject to TTD resonance can be estimated as\n(from Eq.(47) in Brunetti & Lazarian 2007)?? :\n\nDpp\n\n\u03c0 p2 \u03b2pl |Bk |2\nh\ni\n\u2248\n8 c 16\u03c0W f\n\n\u0012\n\n2Iof cs\n7\u03c1\n\n\u0013 12\n\n1\n\nkcoll 2 I\n\n(13)\n\nwhere both I and h...i \u223c a few.\nAs in Sect. 2 we consider the case of firehose instability\nwhere the collisionless scale is (from Eqs.2 and 5):\n3/2\n\nkcoll \u223c 8 ko fslow\n\n\u0010\n\nVL\ncs\n\n\u00113 \u0010\n\ncs\nvA\n\n\u00119\n\n(14)\n\n??

Previous turbulent reacceleration models for the origin of giant radio halos\nwere based on the assumption of a collisionless IGM. In the\ncontext of these models the fact that nowadays giant radio\nhalos are found only in massive (and hot) clusters is interpreted via simple energetics arguments that stem in the\nexpectation that the turbulent injection rate increases with\nthe mass of the merging clusters (e.g. Cassano & Brunetti\n2005).\nAdditional inputs may come from our explorative study. We\nbelieve that the picture may be more complex than previously thought. Assuming that the compressible turbulence\nis generated at large (injection) scales and then cascades to\nsmaller scales, we suggest that the effects of reduced mean\nfree path in a turbulent IGM may allow the fraction of the\nenergy of turbulence that is available to the reacceleration\nof relativistic particles to be larger than that derived for\na collisionless IGM. This readily implies that the damping\nfrom relativistic particles plays a role in regulating the acceleration efficiency and introduces a new physical threshold\nin the mechanism responsible for the reacceleration of the\nrelativistic particles. The threshold is connected with the\nenergy contributed by cosmic rays in the IGM: the level of\ncompressible turbulence in the IGM of hot, merging, clusters may become comparable to (or larger than) that contributed by cosmic rays, while the damping due to these\nparticles may suppress particle reacceleration in less turbulent, relaxed clusters.\nOn the other hand this complex picture does not affect the\nbasic expectations from previous studies. Indeed we show\nthat the scaling of the acceleration efficiency with IGM temperature derived assuming a collisionless IGM may also extend to the case of a weakly\u2013collisionless IGM implying that\nthe conclusion that stochastic acceleration is stronger in the\nhottest clusters holds for a wide range of (micro\u2013)physical\nconditions. By considering the example where the collisionless scale is regulated by the effects of firehose instability,\nboth the acceleration efficiency and the collisional or collisionless nature of the interaction between turbulence and\nthe IGM depend on the beta of the plasma plays, with the\nIGM being more collisional for larger values of \u03b2pl (Eq.14).\nIn this paper we have considered only the case of\nstochastic reacceleration due to compressible turbulence (esc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n\fParticle reacceleration by compressible turbulence in galaxy clusters: effects of reduced mean free path\n\nFigure 3.

However we do not think that the\noverall picture of turbulent reacceleration described in the\npresent paper is complete. Indeed the processes of in situ\nreacceleration of particles in the clusters of galaxies is not\nlimited to the acceleration by fast modes. For instance,\nprocesses of magnetic reconnection in turbulent astrophysical plasmas can induce additional acceleration (see Lazarian & Opher 2009, Drake et al. 2010, Lazarian & Desiati\n2010, Brunetti & Lazarian 2010 and references therein). Also\nAlfv\u00e9n modes were proposed for the reacceleration of relativistic particles in the IGM (e.g. Fujita et al 2003, Brunetti\net al 2004). For instance instabilities in cosmic ray collisionless fluid can induce small-scales Alfven waves with k\nparallel to magnetic fields and those waves can efficiently induce cosmic ray reacceleration (Lazarian & Beresnyak 2006,\nBrunetti & Lazarian 2010, Yan & Lazarian in prep.), a process that requires further investigation. We want to stress\nthat overall, the existence of all these processes in a turbulent IGM is suggestive that even larger share of energy (compared to our present estimates) of turbulence energy can be\ntransferred to relativistic particles in the galaxy clusters.\n\n6\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nIt has been proposed that the observed giant radio halos\nmay be due to turbulent reacceleration of relativistic particles in merging clusters. Calculations of particle acceleration\nby MHD turbulence must account self-consistently for the\nnon\u2013linear interaction between turbulent waves and particles. Previous theoretical works in this context focus on the\ninteraction between compressible turbulence (fast modes)\nand both the thermal IGM and the relativistic particles by\nassuming a collisionless IGM. In this case about 90 percent\nof the energy of fast modes goes into heating of the thermal\nplasma, while only 10 percent is available for the reacceleration of relativistic particles (eg. Brunetti & Lazarian 2007).\nIn this paper we explore a new possibility for the parc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\nticle reacceleration by compressible turbulence where the\ninteraction between turbulent modes and the thermal IGM\nis collisional at scales much smaller than the Coulomb mean\nfree path. We have motivated this guess by observing that\nseveral plasma instabilities can be generated by turbulent\nmotions in the IGM driving perturbations in the magnetic\nfield that induce scattering of charged particles on scales\nmuch smaller than the Coulomb mean free path. This process results in a collective interaction of individual ions with\nthe rest of the plasma and potentially constrains the effective collisionless scale to (about) the scales where instabilities develop.\nUnder these conditions we find that an increasing fraction\nof the energy of fast modes is available to the reacceleration\nof relativistic particles and that the collisionless damping\nof turbulent motions induced by these particles contribute\nto self-regulate the acceleration process. Assuming a collisional IGM, all the energy of fast modes is channeled into\nthe reacceleration of relativistic particles. Interestingly in\nthis case the upper limits to the energy densities of cosmic\nrays in galaxy clusters derived by recent gamma and radio\nobservations provide also constraints to the fraction of the\nthermal energy in the IGM available for fast modes. In a\ncollisional IGM the acceleration efficiency results from the\nbalance between the injection rate of compressible turbulent motions and the rate of turbulent damping due to the\nreaccelerated particles. In this case we find that a universal acceleration regime is established as soon as turbulent\nenergy approaches equipartition with the energy density of\nrelativistic particles, and that in this case typical (systematic) reacceleration times \u223c 108 yrs are provided by TTD\nwith fast modes.\nUnder the assumption of a collisional IGM we calculate the\nreacceleration of relativistic protons and of secondary relativistic electrons. Based on present constraints from FERMI\nobservations of nearby clusters, we consider a situation\nwhere cosmic rays contribute to a few percent of the thermal\n\n7\n\n\f8\n\nG. Brunetti, A. Lazarian\n\nenergy of the IGM and show that relativistic electrons can be\nreaccelerated at energies of several GeV, provided that compressible turbulence, generated at large scales, contributes\nto several percent of the cluster thermal energy. The reaccelerated electrons emit synchrotron radiation at GHz frequencies in typical (several) \u03bcG magnetic fields providing an\nexplanation for the origin of the observed giant radio halos.\nRemarkably, in the case of collisional IGM the amount of\ncluster turbulence necessary to reaccelerate GeV electrons\nis significantly smaller than that in models that assume a\ncollisionless IGM.\nWhether the interaction between turbulence and IGM behaves collisionless or collisional depends on the effect of the\nreduced mean free path. It is reasonable to assume that the\nIGM becomes (at least) weakly\u2013collisionless as soon as a\nsufficient (even modest) level of compressible turbulence is\ngenerated. This has important consequences on the process\nof particle acceleration by compressible turbulence in the\nIGM. All the calculations of turbulent reacceleration developed under the assumptions of a collisionless IGM should be\nretained as conservative approaches. Consequently our explorative study provides further theoretical support to the\nidea that turbulence may play an important role in the the\norigin of non-thermal components (and emission) on cluster\nscales.\nFinally we want to remark that although we believe that\nfast modes may play an important role in the process of in\nsitu reacceleration, additional processes in a turbulent IGM\n(e.g. reconnection, resonance with small scale Alfv\u00e9n waves,\netc) may allow a larger fraction of the energy of cluster\u2013\nturbulence to become available for the reacceleration of relativistic particles. Further research should quantify these\nprocesses.\n\n7\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\nWe thank G.Setti for useful comments.
