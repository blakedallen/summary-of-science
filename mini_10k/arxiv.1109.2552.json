C. Tian, on behalf of the SciNO\u03bdA Study Group\n\narXiv:1109.2552v2 [hep-ex] 13 Sep 2011\n\nDepartment of Physics and Astronomy, University of South Carolina, Columbia, SC, USA\nSciNO\u03bdA is a proposed experiment to deploy a fine-grained scintillator detector in front of the\nNO\u03bdA near detector to collect neutrino-nucleus scattering events in the NuMI, off-axis, narrow-band\nneutrino beam at Fermilab. This detector can make unique contributions to the measurement of\ncharged- and neutral-current quasi-elastic scattering; and neutral-current \u03c0 0 and photon production. These processes are important to understand for fundamental physics and as backgrounds to\nmeasurements of electron neutrino appearance oscillations.\n\nI.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe next generation of long baseline neutrino experiments aims to measure the third mixing angle \u03b813 ,\ndetermine whether CP is violated in the lepton sector, and resolve the neutrino mass hierarchy [1\u20133]. The\nNuMI Off-axis electron-neutrino (\u03bde ) Appearance (NO\u03bdA) experiment is the flagship experiment of the US\ndomestic particle physics program which has the potential to address most of the fundamental questions in\nneutrino physics raised by the Particle Physics Project Prioritization Panel (P5). NO\u03bdA has two detectors,\na 222 ton near detector located underground at Fermilab and a 14 kiloton far detector located in Ash River,\nMinnesota with a baseline of 810 km. The detectors are composed of extruded PVC cells loaded with Titanium\ndioxide to enhance reflectivity. There are 16,416 and 356,352 cells for the near and far detector, respectively.\nEach cell has an size of 3.93 cm transverse to the beam direction and 6.12 cm along the direction. The\ncorresponding radiation length is 0.15 X0 , ideal for the identification of electron-type neutrino events. The\n\"Neutrinos at the Main Injector\" (NuMI) beam will provide a 14 mrad off-axis neutrino beam to reduce neutral\ncurrent backgrounds and which peaks at 2 GeV, corresponding to the first oscillation maximum for this detector\ndistance as shown in Fig. 1. The accelerator and NuMI upgrades will double the protons per year delivered to\nthe detector which is 6 \u00d7 1020 protons per year.\n\nFIG. 1: The NuMI neutrino energy spectrum at different off-axis angles. The NO\u03bdA detectors are located at 14 mrad.\n\nThe interpretation of the oscillation results requires detailed knowledge of the neutrino spectrum, neutrino\ncross-sections, nuclear effects, and final state topologies. SciNO\u03bdA is a proposed fine-grained detector [5]\nplaced directly in front of the NO\u03bdA near detector which can be used to measure neutrino-nucleus scattering.\nComparing with the wide band beams used by the MINER\u03bdA and SciBooNE experiments, the narrow band\nbeam will provide better apriori knowledge of the incident neutrino energy, and has lower background from high\n\n1\n\n\f2\n\nProceedings of the DPF-2011 Conference, Providence, RI, August 8-13, 2011\nenergy feed-down. In the energy region around 2 GeV, the SciNO\u03bdA detector will record about 1 M events per\nyear as shown in Tab. I.\nTABLE I: The event rates per year for elastic, resonant, deep-inelastic (DIS) and coherent neutrino scattering recorded\nby SciNO\u03bdA detector calculated using the GENIE neutrino generator [4].\nCharged-Current (\u00d7103 ) Neutral-Current (\u00d7103 )\nElastic\n220\n86\nResonant\n327\n115\nDIS\n289\n96\nCoherent\n8\n5\nTotal\n845\n302\n\u03bd + A \u2192 \u03c00 + X\n204\n106\n\nII.\n\nSCINO\u03bdA DETECTOR\n\nThe baseline design of the SciNO\u03bdA detector is a copy of the SciBar detector used as the near detector for\nthe K2K experiment [6] in Japan and SciBooNE experiment [17] at Fermilab. The detector is composed of\n14,848 extruded 1.3\u00d72.5\u00d7290 cm3 scintillator strips arranged in 64 layers. Each layer consists of an X and Y\nplane enabling a 3-D reconstruction, each containing 116 strips. The scintillator strips are made of polystyrene\ndoped with PPO and POPOP and are co-extruded with a TiO2 reflection coating 0.25 mm thick to increase\nthe reflectivity. The total active volume of the scintillator is 2.9\u00d72.9\u00d7 1.7 m3 with total mass of 15 tons. Each\nstrip contains an embedded 1.5 mm diameter wavelength-shifting (WLS) fiber used to collect the light from the\nscintillator extrusions. A group of 64 fibers will be gathered into a 64-anode multianode photomultiplier tubes\n(MAPMT) for readout. The Hamamatsu H8804 MAPMTs will be used as the photo detector. It has a bialkali\ncathode yielding a quantum efficiency of \u223c 12% at the WLS fiber emission wavelength around 480 nm. At 800V,\nthe MAPMTs will provide a gain of 6 \u00d7 105 with typical pixel-pixel uniformity of 1:2.5 and cross talk of 4%\nfor adjacent pixels. A 12-PMT prototype readout system has been built and is running at Indiana University\nwhich can be adopted to be used as the SciNO\u03bdA detector readout system for the 232 PMTs. Other technology\noptions, such as the size of the scintillator strips, the photo detector technologies, and corresponding readout\nsystem are under study in order to optimize the performance of the SciNO\u03bdA detector. The steel detector frame\nused by the SciBooNE experiment will be reused as the detector support structure to save cost. The SciNO\u03bdA\ndetector will be placed directly in front of the NO\u03bdA near detector as shown in Fig. 2. There is adequate space\nin front of the NO\u03bdA near detector to accommodate the SciNO\u03bdA detector, so no additional cavern excavation\nwill be needed.\nThe total cost of the proposed SciNO\u03bdA detector is $2.4 M (baseline design), dominated by the detector\nconstruction and assembly ($0.8 M) and new readout electronics ($1.42 M). The expected start time is the\nsummer of 2012 and will be ready when the NO\u03bdA Far Detector is ready in early 2014. The SciNO\u03bdA proposal\nwas presented to the Fermilab Physics Advisory Committee (PAC) in November 2010 and the PAC recommended\nthat NO\u03bdA consider SciNO\u03bdA. The NO\u03bdA collaboration supports the SciNO\u03bdA physics case and is seriously\nevaluating it as a possibility. A study group consisting of NO\u03bdA and non-NO\u03bdA physicists recently formed to\nanswer remaining technical questions. The funding is correctly being sougth.\nIII.\n\nSCINO\u03bdA PHYSICS\n\nThe fine-grained SciNO\u03bdA detector using the narrow band beam will accumulate around 1 M events per year\nas shown in Tab. I which will enable a detailed study of neutrino-nucleus scattering. This not only will provide\na significant cross check of NO\u03bdA oscillation background processes, but also will add important information to\nbetter understand some current mysteries, including the anomalously large charged-current quasi-elastic cross\nsection measured by MiniBooNE [8] and the apparent absence of charged current coherent pion production\nobserved by the K2K [9] and SciBooNE [10] experiments at low neutrino energies. SciNO\u03bdA may also be\nable to shed further light on the excess of electron-like events observed in MiniBooNE [11, 12] and provide a\nmeasurement of the spin structure of the nucleon using neutral current elastic scattering. I will focus on the\nCCQE measurement, for other physics topics, please refer to Ref.

As SciNO\u03bdA will use a narrow band beam, we\nwill have a better prior knowledge about the neutrino flux, and also there will be lower CC\u03c0 + background\ncontamination from the high energy feeddown. Following the error analysis of the recent MiniBooNE CCQE\nanalysis, we estimated the systematic errors that would result from SciNO\u03bdA measurements of the total cross\nsection. In this analysis, the absolute flux error is assigned to be 10%. The CC\u03c0 + background contains two\ncategories: pion absorption as modeled by the NUANCE event generator [18] and pion mis-identification. The\nresults are summarized in Fig. 3. The study shows that the dominant error in the region of the peak neutrino\nenergy around 2 GeV is the neutrino flux, and the CC\u03c0 + background errors dominate at energies below from\nthe flux peak because of the higher energy \"feed down\".

The fine-grained detector enables us to explore the full reconstructed kinematics of two protons, therefore\na search for two correlated protons with a muon in the final state can be performed in the SciNO\u03bdA detector.\nThe signal is a muon plus two protons, and the backgrounds are from \"true\" CCQE events producing an extra\nnucleon via final final state interactions in carbon and CC\u03c0 + events where the pion is absorbed and multiple\nnucleons are produced in the final states. A study has been done using NUANCE MC by choosing events\nwith 0.3 < Q2 < 0.8 GeV2 , corresponding to the bulk of the MiniBooNE measured cross section range. The\nreconstructed protons are required to have a minimum momentum of 450 GeV/c. The missing transverse moT\nmentum Pm1\ncalculated from the muon and leading energetic proton is required to be greater than 220 MeV/c\nT\n(Fermi momentum) and Pm2\ncalculated from the muon and both protons is required to be less than 220 MeV/c.\nT\nT\nFig. 5 shows the missing transverse momentum distribution of Pm1\nversus Pm2\nfor different processes. We also\nrequire the opening angle between two-proton momentum vectors, cos \u03b3, to be less than -0.5 as shown in Fig. 6.\nAfter applying all the cuts, there are about 4,000 signal events with a signal/background ratio of 3 as shown\nin Tab. III. The fine-grained SciNO\u03bdA detector permits us to explore the full reconstructed kinematics which\noffers rich physics content and should provide an understanding of the underlying physics even if 2-nucleon\ncorrelations do not prove to be substantial in the CCQE neutrino process. Therefore, SciNO\u03bdA can make a\nsignificant contribution to the role of 2-nucleons correlations in the CCQE process.\n\n5\n\n\fProceedings of the DPF-2011 Conference, Providence, RI, August 8-13, 2011\n800\na)\n\n600\n400\n200\n0\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\n500\n\n600\n\n700\n\n800\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\n500\n\n600\n\n700\n\n800\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\n500\n\n600\n\n800\nb)\n\n600\n400\n200\n0\npTm2 (MeV/c)\n\n6\n\n800\nc)\n\n600\n400\n200\n0\n\nFigure 5: Missing transverse momenta p\n\n, p\n\n700\n800\npTm1 (MeV/c)\n\n2D distributions for a) 2-nucleon signal, b)\n\nT\nT T m1\nT m2\nFIG. 5: The 2D distribution of Pm1\nin y versus Pm2\nin x passing\nthe selection criteria described in the text.

The electron-neutrino chargedcurrent events selection efficiency is \u223c 35%, while the acceptance probabilities of neutral-current backgrounds\nand muon neutrino charged-current events are 0.4% and 0.1% respectively.\nThe background rejection factors for the experiment 10\nmust not only be large, but they must also be well known\nto avoid having the sensitivity of the experiment degraded by uncertainties on the backgrounds. The fine-grained\nSciNO\u03bdA detector will not only enhance the signal efficiency and background rejection estimation, but also add\na powerful cross-check of the NO\u03bdA detector performance by providing an more efficient signal/background\ndetermination which can be compared to the determination made by the NO\u03bdA detector, similar in concept\nto techniques (\"Double Scan\") used in the analysis of bubble chamber data. The study shows that one would\nexpect this \"double scan\" technique to find any miscalculations of the signal and background efficiencies as large\nas a few percent. This method is a powerful cross-check of the detector capabilities that uses the neutrino data\n\n\fevents/10ton/6E20POT\n\nProceedings of the DPF-2011 Conference, Providence, RI, August 8-13, 2011\n\n1400\n1200\n1000\n800\n600\n400\n200\n0\n\n-1\n\n-0.8\n\n-0.6\n\n-0.4\n\n-0.2\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\ncos\u03b3\n\nFigure 6: Two-proton opening angle, cos \u03b3, distribution for candidate events passing cuts.
