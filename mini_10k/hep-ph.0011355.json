The realization that the chargechanging weak interactions violated P and C maximally was central to their\nformulation in the V \u2212 A theory. The theory was constructed in 1957 to conserve the product CP, but within seven years the discovery of decay of the\nlong-lived neutral kaon to two pions 1 showed that even CP was not conserved.\nNearly twenty years later, Kobayashi and Maskawa (KM) 2 proposed that CP\nviolation in the neutral kaon system could be explained in a model with three\nfamilies of quarks, at a time (1973) when no evidence for the third family\nand not even all evidence for the second had been found. The quarks of the\nthird family, now denoted by b for bottom and t for top, were subsequently\ndiscovered in 1977 3 and 1994, 4 respectively.\nDecays of hadrons containing b quarks now appear to be particularly fruitful ground for testing the KM hypothesis and for displaying evidence for any\nnew physics beyond this \"standard model\" of CP violation. A meson containing a b\u0304 quark will be known generically as a B meson, in the same way as a K\nmeson contains an (anti-) strange quark s\u0304. The present lectures are devoted\nto some tests of CP violation utilizing B meson decays. (Baryons containing\nb quarks also may display CP violation but we will not discuss them here.)\nWe first deal with the spectroscopy and interactions of the b quark. In\nSection 2 we describe the discovery of the charmed quark, the tau lepton, the\nb quark, and B mesons. Section 3 is devoted to the spectroscopy of hadrons\ncontaining the b quark, while Section 4 treats its weak interactions. Neutral\nmesons containing the b quark can mix with their antiparticles (Section 5),\n1\n\n\fproviding important information on the weak interactions of b quarks.\nWe then introduce CP violation in B meson decays. After general remarks\nand a discussion of decays to CP eigenstates (Section 6) we turn to decays to\nCP-noneigenstates (Section 7) and describe various methods of tagging the\nflavor of an initially-produced B meson (Section 8). Some specialized topics\ninclude strange B's (Section 9), decays to pairs of light mesons (Section 10),\nand the roles of penguin diagrams (Section 11), and final-state interactions\n(Section 12).\nTopics not covered in detail in the lectures but worthy of mention in this review are noted briefly in Section 13. The possibility that the Standard Model\nof CP violation might fail at some future time to describe all the observed\nphenomena is discussed in Section 14, while Section 15 concludes. Other contemporary reviews of the subject 5,6 may be consulted.\n2\n2.1\n\nDiscovery of the b quark\nPrelude: The charmed quark\n\nDuring the 1960's and 1970's, when the electromagnetic and weak interactions\nwere being unified by Glashow, Weinberg, and Salam,7 it was realized 8 that a\nconsistent theory of hadrons required a parallel 9 between the then-known two\npairs of weak isodoublets of leptons, (\u03bde , e\u2212 ), (\u03bd\u03bc , \u03bc\u2212 ), and a corresponding\nmultiplet structure for quarks, (u, d), (c, s). The known quarks at that time\nconsisted of one with charge 2/3, the up quark u, and two with charge \u22121/3,\nthe down quark d and the strange quark s. The charmed quark c was a second\nquark with charge 2/3 and a proposed mass of about 1.5 to 2 GeV/c2 .10,11\nThe parallel between leptons and quarks was further motivated by the\ncancellation of anomalies 8,12 in the electroweak theory. These are associated\nwith triangle graphs involving fermion loops and three electroweak currents.\nIt is sufficient to consider the anomaly for the product I3L Q2 , where I3L is the\nthird\nof left-handed isospin and Q is the electric charge. The sum\nP component\n2\ni (I3L )i Qi over all fermions i must vanish. If a family of quarks and leptons\nconsists of one weak isodoublet of quarks and one of leptons, this cancellation\ncan be implemented within a family, as illustrated in Table 1.\nThe first hints of charm arose in nuclear emulsions 13 and were recognized as\nsuch by Kobayashi and Maskawa.2 However, more definitive evidence appeared\nin November, 1974, in the form of the 3 S1 cc\u0304 ground state discovered simultaneously on the East 14 and West 15 Coasts of the U. S. and named, respectively,\nJ and \u03c8. The East Coast experiment utilized the reaction p + Be \u2192 e+ e\u2212 + . . .\nand observed the J as a peak at 3.1 GeV/c2 in the effective e+ e\u2212 mass. The\nWest Coast experiment studied e+ e\u2212 collisions in the SPEAR storage ring and\n2\n\n\fTable 1: Anomaly cancellation in the electroweak theory.\nFamily\nNeutrino\nCharged lepton\nQ = 2/3 quark\nQ = \u22121/3 quark\n\n1\n\u03bde\ne\u2212\nu\nd\n\n2\n\u03bd\u03bc\n\u03bc\u2212\nc\ns\n\n3\n\u03bd\u03c4\n\u03c4\u2212\nt\nb\n\nContribution per family\n(1/2)(0)2 = 0\n(\u22121/2)(\u22121)2 = \u22121/2\n3(1/2)(2/3)2 = 2/3\n3(\u22121/2)(\u22121/3)2 = \u22121/6\n\nsaw a peak in the cross section for production of e+ e\u2212 , \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 , and hadrons at\na center-of-mass energy of 3.1 GeV. Since the discovery of the J/\u03c8 the charmonium level structure has blossomed into a richer set of levels than has been\nobserved for the original \"onium\" system, the e+ e\u2212 positronium bound states.\nThe lowest charmonium levels are narrow because they are kinematically\nunable to decay to pairs of charmed mesons (each containing a single charmed\nquark). The threshold for this decay is at a mass of about 3.73 GeV/c2 . Above\nthis mass, the charmonium levels gradually become broader. The charmed\nmesons, discovered in 1976 and subsequently, include D+ = cd \u0304 (mass 1.869\nGeV/c2 ), D0 = c\u016b (mass 1.865 GeV/c2 ), and Ds = cs\u0304 (mass 1.969 GeV/c2 ).\nThese mesons were initially hard to find because the large variety of their\npossible decays made any one mode elusive. For example, the two-body decay\nD0 \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 + has a branching ratio of only about 3.8%; 16 higher-multiplicity\ndecays are somewhat favored.\n2.2\n\nPrelude: The \u03c4 lepton\n\nAbout the same time as the discovery of charm, another signal was showing\nup in e+ e\u2212 collisions at SPEAR, corresponding to the production of a pair of\nnew leptons: e+ e\u2212 \u2192 \u03b3 \u2217 \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 .17 The \u03c4 signal had a number of features\nopposite to those of charm: lower- rather than higher-multiplicity decays and\nfewer rather than more kaons in its decay products, for example, so separating\nthe two contributions took some time.18\nThe mass of the \u03c4 is 1.777 GeV/c2 . Its favored decay products are a tau\nneutrino, \u03bd\u03c4 , and whatever the charged weak current can produce, including\ne\u03bd\u0304e , \u03bc\u03bd\u0304\u03bc , \u03c0, \u03c1, etc. It thus contributes somewhat less than one unit to\nR\u2261\n\nX\ni\n\nQ2i =\n\n\u03c3(e+ e\u2212 \u2192 hadrons)\n\u03c3(e+ e\u2212 \u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 )\n\n,\n\n(1)\n\nwhich would have risen from the value of 2 for u, d, s quarks below charm\nthreshold to 10/3 above charm threshold if charm alone were being produced,\nbut was seen to rise considerably higher.\n3\n\n\fOne problem with accepting the \u03c4 as a companion of the charmed quark\nwas that the neat anomaly cancellation provided by the charmed quark, mentioned above, was immediately upset. The anomaly contributed by the \u03c4 lepton\nwould have to be cancelled by further particles, such as a pair of new quarks\n(t, b) with charge 2/3 and \u22121/3. Such quarks had indeed already been utilized\ntwo years before the \u03c4 was established, in 1973 by Kobayashi and Maskawa 2\nin their theory of CP violation. The names \"top\" and \"bottom\" were coined\nby Harari in 1975,19 in analogy with \"up\" and \"down.\"\n2.3\n\nDilepton spectroscopy\n\nOne reason for the experiment which discovered the J particle 14 was an earlier\nstudy, also at Brookhaven National Laboratory, by L. Lederman and his collaborators, of \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 pairs produced in proton-uranium collisions.20 The m(\u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 )\nspectrum in this experiment displayed a shoulder around 3.5 GeV/c2 . It was\nnot recognized as a resonant peak and was displaced in mass from the true\nJ/\u03c8 value because of the poor mass resolution of the experiment.\nAfter the discovery of the J/\u03c8, Lederman's group continued to pursue\ndilepton spectroscopy. In 1977 a search with greater sensitivity and better\nmass resolution turned up evidence for peaks at 9.4, 10.0, and possibly 10.35\nGeV/c2 .3 These were candidates for the 1S, 2S, and 3S 3 S1 levels of a new QQ\u0304\nsystem. Several pieces of evidence identified the heavy quark Q as a b quark.\n(1) The \u03a5(1S) and \u03a5\u2032 (2S) were produced in 1978 by the electron-positron\ncollider DORIS at DESY and their partial widths to e+ e\u2212 pairs were measured.21\nIt was shown 22 that if the QQ\u0304 system was bound by the same quantum chromodynamic force as as the cc\u0304 (charmonium) system, one could use the cc\u0304 states\nto gain some idea about the details of the QQ\u0304 binding. Since \u0393(QQ\u0304) \u221d e2Q ,\nwhere eQ is the charge of the quark Q, it was possible to conclude from the\ndata that |eQ | = 1/3 was favored over |eQ | = 2/3.\n(2) The Cornell e+ e\u2212 ring CESR began operating in 1979,23 reaching a\nfourth \u03a5(4S) peak and finding it broader than the first three. This indicated\nthat the meson pair threshold lay below M [\u03a5(4S)]= 10.58 GeV/c2 . Farther\nabove this threshold, wiggles in the total cross section for hadron production\naveraged out to indicate a step in R of 1/3, confirming that |eQ | = 1/3.\n(3) The possibility that Q was an isosinglet quark of charge \u22121/3, and thus\nnot the partner of some quark t with charge 2/3, was ruled out by the absence\nof significant flavor-changing neutral current decays such as b \u2192 s\u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 .24,25\nThe structure of the \u03a5 levels is remarkably similar to that of the charmonium levels except for having more levels below flavor threshold. For example,\nthe fact that the 3S level is below flavor threshold allows it to decay to the\n4\n\n\f2P levels via electric dipole transitions with appreciable branching ratios; the\ntransitions between the S and P levels are well described in potential models which reproduce other aspects of the spectra. Several reviews treat the\nfascinating regularities of the spectroscopy of these levels.26\n2.4\n\nDiscovery of B mesons\n\nThe lightest meson containing a b quark and each flavor of light antiquark is\nexpected to decay weakly. The allowed decays of b are (c or u) + (virtual W \u2212 ),\nwith the c giving rise to lots of strange particles while the u gives few strange\nparticles. The virtual W \u2212 can decay to \u016bd, c\u0304s, e\u2212 \u03bd\u0304e , \u03bc\u2212 \u03bd\u0304\u03bc , and \u03c4 \u2212 \u03bd\u0304\u03c4 .\nIn e+ e\u2212 collisions above B B\u0304 threshold, several signals of B meson production were observed by the CLEO Collaboration starting around 1980: 27\n\u2022 Prompt leptons (signals of semileptonic decay)\n\u2212\n\u2022 An abundance of kaons (a signal that b \u2192 c + Wvirt\nis preferred over\n\u2212\nb \u2192 u + Wvirt )\n\n\u2022 \"Daughter\" (lower-momentum) leptons from c semileptonic decays.\nThese indirect signals were followed by reconstruction of B + and B 0\ndecays,28 e.g.,\n \u0304 \u2192 D\u03040 \u03c0 + ,\nB + = b\u0304u \u2192 c\u0304udu\n\n \u0304 = D\u2212 \u03c0+\nB 0 = b\u0304d \u2192 c\u0304udd\n\n.\n\n(2)\n\nTypical branching ratios for these final states 16 are (5.3 \u00b1 0.5) \u00d7 10\u22123 for\nD\u03040 \u03c0 + and (3.0 \u00b1 0.4) \u00d7 10\u22123 for D\u2212 \u03c0 + . B 0 \u2192 D\u03040 \u03c0 0 is also allowed but\nnot yet observed. These small branching ratios mean that reconstruction of\nexclusive final states is even harder for B mesons than for charmed particles.\n3\n3.1\n\nThe known B hadrons\nB mesons\n\nThe nonstrange ground-state B (pseudoscalar) and B \u2217 (vector) mesons are\ncompared with the corresponding charmed mesons in Table 2. Evidence for the\nBs\u2217 exists in the form of a photon signal for the decay Bs\u2217 \u2192 Bs \u03b3.29 The photon\nenergy, 46 MeV, is expected to be the same as that seen in B \u22170 \u2192 B 0 \u03b3.30\nSince the B \u2217 and B states are separated by only 46 MeV, a B \u2217 should\nalways decay to a B of the same flavor and a photon. This is in contrast to\nthe case of the D\u2217 and D states, whose separation is just about a pion mass.\nThe electromagnetic mass splittings are such that D\u2217+ \u2192 D0 \u03c0 + , D\u2217+ \u2192\n5\n\n\fTable 2: Ground-state heavy-light (Qq\u0304) pseudoscalar mesons and the corresponding vector\nmesons.

The low-momentum \u03c0 + in D\u2217+ \u2192 D0 \u03c0 + acts as a \"tag,\" useful\nboth for signalling the production of a charmed meson 31 and, by its charge,\ndistinguishing the D0 from a D\u03040 . Since B \u2217 decays are not useful for this type of\n\"flavor\" tag, one must resort to the decays of heavier excited bq\u0304 states (Section\n8).\nThe hyperfine splitting of B mesons is smaller than that in charmed mesons\nbecause the chromomagnetic moments of the heavy quarks scale as the inverse\nof their masses:\nmB \u2217 \u2212 mB\n1/mb\nmc\n1\n\u2243\n=\n\u2243\n.\n(3)\n\u2217\nmD \u2212 mD\n1/mc\nmb\n3\n3.2\n\nThe \u039bb baryon\n\nThe lightest baryon containing a b quark is the \u039bb = b[ud]I=0 . Its mass is\n5624 \u00b1 9 MeV/c2 .16 The ud system must be in a color 3\u2217 (antisymmetric)\nstate, since the b is a color triplet and the \u039bb is a color singlet. The spin-zero\nstate of ud is favored over the spin-one state by the chromodynamic hyperfine\ninteraction. By Fermi statistics, the ud pair must then be in an (antisymmetric)\nisospin-zero state. For similar reasons, the I = 0 state of a strange quark and\ntwo nonstrange quarks, the \u039b = s[ud]I=0 with mass 1116 MeV/c2 , is lighter\nthan the \u03a3 = s(uu, ud, dd)I=1 states with average mass 1193 MeV/c2 .\nThe charmed analogue of the \u039bb is the \u039bc = c[ud]I=0 with mass 2284.9\u00b10.6\nMeV/c2 . The difference in mass of the two particles is M (\u039bb ) \u2212 M (\u039bc ) =\n3339 \u00b1 9 MeV/c2 . This provides an estimate of mb \u2212 mc since there are no\nhyperfine terms involving the heavy quark; the light-quark system has zero\n\u22121\nspin in both baryons. There will be a correction of order m\u22121\ndue to\nc \u2212 mb\n6\n\n\fpossible differences in kinetic energies.\nOne can perform a similar estimate for Qq\u0304 mesons by eliminating the\nhyperfine energy, performing a suitable average over vector (3 S1 ) and pseudoscalar (1 S0 ) meson masses. The expectation value of the relevant interaction\nterm is h\u03c3Q *\u03c3q\u0304 i = (1, \u22123) for (3 S1 ,1 S0 ) states. Thus the hyperfine energy is absent in the combination [3M (3 S1 ) + M (1 S0 )]/4. Since (3MD\u2217 + MD )/4 = 1973\nMeV/c2 and (3MB \u2217 + MB )/4 = 5313 MeV/c2 (taking isospin averages), we\nestimate from the mesons that mb \u2212 mc = 3340 MeV/c2 , identical to the estimate from the baryons. (Again, kinetic energies could provide a correction\nto this result.) The spectroscopic assignment of the \u039bb is thus likely to be the\ncorrect one.\n\u2212\nKnown decay modes of the \u039bb include \u039b+\nc l \u03bd\u0304l and J/\u03c8\u039b. The fact that\nthe corresponding quark subprocesses b \u2192 cl\u2212 \u03bd\u0304l and b \u2192 cc\u0304s conserve isospin\nleads to the requirement that the final states have zero isospin in both cases,\nrestricting the number of additional pions that can be produced.\n4\n\nInteractions of the b quark\n\nIn this Section we shall discuss the way in which the interactions of the b\nquark provide information on the pattern of charge-changing weak interactions\nof quarks parametrized by the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix\nV .2,32 More details on determination of the CKM matrix are included in the\nlectures by Buchalla,33 DeGrand,34 Falk,35 , Neubert,36 and Wolfenstein,37\n4.1\n\nThe b lifetime: indication of small |Vcb |\n\nThe long b quark lifetime (> 1 ps) indicated that the CKM element Vcb was\nconsiderably smaller than |Vus | \u2243 |Vcd | \u2243 0.22. One can estimate Vcb using a\nfree-quark method.\nThe subprocess b \u2192 cW \u2217\u2212 \u2192 cl\u2212 \u03bd\u0304l has a rate\n\u0393(b \u2192 cl\u2212 \u03bd\u0304l ) =\n\nG2F\nm5 |Vcb |2 f (mb , mc , ml ) ,\n192\u03c0 3 b\n\n(4)\n\nwhere GF = 1.16637(2) \u00d7 10\u22125 GeV\u22122 is the Fermi coupling constant. In the\nlimit in which the lepton mass can be neglected, f (mb , mc , ml ) = f (m2c /m2b ),\nwith f (x) = 1 \u2212 8x + 8x3 \u2212 x4 \u2212 12x2 ln x. The uncertainty in the prediction\nfor \u0393(b \u2192 cl\u2212 \u03bd\u0304l ) due to that in mb is mitigated by the constraint noted above\non mb \u2212 mc \u2243 3.34 GeV/c2 .\nTaking a nominal range of quark masses around mb = 4.7 GeV/c2 (and\nhence a range around mc = 1.36 GeV/c2 , f (m2c /m2b ) = 0.54), \u03c4b = 1.6 \u00d7 10\u22126\n7\n\n\fs,16 and the branching ratio B(b \u2192 cl\u03bdl ) \u2243 10.2%, one finds\n\u0012\n\u0013\nmb \u2212 4.7 GeV/c2\n|Vcb \u2243 0.0384 \u2212 0.0008\n.\n0.1 GeV/c2\n\n(5)\n\nThus if mb is uncertain by 0.3 GeV/c2 (my guess), |Vcb | is uncertain by \u00b10.0024.\nRecent averages 16,35 give rise to values of |Vcb | somewhat above 0.040 with\nerrors of \u00b10.002 to \u00b10.003.\nA new report by the CLEO Collaboration 38 finds |Vcb | = 0.0462 \u00b1 0.0036\nbased on the exclusive decay process B 0 \u2192 D\u2217\u2212 l+ \u03bdl . This new determination\nbears watching as it would affect many conclusions regarding predictions for\nCP-violating asymmetries in B decays. We shall take |Vcb | = 0.041 \u00b1 0.003 as\nrepresenting a conservative range of present values.\n4.2\n\nCharmless b decays: indication of smaller |Vub |\n\nAlthough the u quark is lighter than the c quark, its production in b decays is\ndisfavored, with \u0393(b \u2192 ul\u03bd)/\u0393(b \u2192 cl\u03bd) only about 2%. Since the phase-space\nfactor f (m2u /m2b ) is very close to 1, while f (m2c /m2b ) \u2243 1/2, this means that\n|Vub /Vcb |2 \u2243 1%, or |Vub /Vcb | \u2243 0.1. The error on this quantity is dominated by\ntheoretical uncertainty 35 ; detailed studies 39 indicate |Vub /Vcb | = 0.090\u00b10.025.\n4.3\n\nPattern of charge-changing weak quark transitions\n\nThe relative strengths of charge-changing weak quark transitions are illustrated\nin Fig. 1. Why the pattern looks like this is a mystery, one of the questions\n(along with the values of the quark masses) to be answered at a deeper level.\nThe interactions in Fig. 1 may be parametrized by a Cabibbo-KobayashiMaskawa (CKM) matrix of the form 40\n\nVCKM\n\n\uf8f9\n2\n1 \u2212 \u03bb2\n\u03bb A\u03bb3 (\u03c1 \u2212 i\u03b7)\n2\n\uf8fb\n=\uf8f0\nA\u03bb2\n\u2212\u03bb\n1 \u2212 \u03bb2\n3\n2\nA\u03bb (1 \u2212 \u03c1 \u2212 i\u03b7) \u2212A\u03bb\n1\n\uf8ee\n\n.\n\n(6)\n\nThe columns refer to d, s, b and the rows to u, c, t.

The\nvalue |Vcb | = 0.041 \u00b1 0.003 indicates A = 0.85 \u00b1 0.06, while |Vub /Vcb | = 0.090 \u00b1\n0.025 implies (\u03c12 + \u03b7 2 )1/2 = 0.41 \u00b1 0.11.\nFurther information may be obtained by assuming that box diagrams involving internal quarks u, c, t with charge 2/3 are responsible for both the\nCP-violating contribution to K 0 \u2013K\u0304 0 mixing and to mixing between neutral B\n8\n\n\fFigure 1: Pattern of charge-changing weak transitions among quarks.

The parameter |\u01ebK | = (2.27 \u00b1 0.02) \u00d7 10\u22123 (see\nBuchalla's lectures 33 ) then implies a constraint 42\n\u03b7(1 \u2212 \u03c1 + 0.39) = 0.35 \u00b1 0.12 ,\n\n(7)\n\nwhere the 1 \u2212 \u03c1 term in parentheses arises from box diagrams with two internal\ntop quarks, while the correction 0.39 is due to diagrams with one charmed and\none top quark. The error on the right-hand side is due primarily to uncertainty\nin the Wolfenstein parameter A = |Vcb |/\u03bb2 , which enters to the fourth power\nin the tt\u0304 contribution to \u01ebK . A lesser source of error is uncertainty in the\nparameter BK describing the quark box diagram's matrix element between a\nK 0 and a K\u0304 0 . We have chosen 43 BK = 0.87 \u00b1 0.13.\n0\nPresent information on B 0 \u2013B mixing, interpreted in terms of box diagrams with two quarks of charge 2/3, leads to a constraint \u221aon |Vtd |2 which\nimplies 42 |1 \u2212 \u03c1 \u2212 i\u03b7| = 0.87 \u00b1 0.21 for the parameter range fB BB = 230 \u00b1 40\nMeV describing the matrix element of the short-distance 4-quark operator\n \u0304 between B 0 and B 0 states.

(Lattice gauge theories 34 estimate this coefficent more precisely,\ngenerally giving values between 1.1 and 1.2.) One finds |Vts /Vtd | \u2265 4.4 or\n|1 \u2212 \u03c1 \u2212 i\u03b7| < 1.01. The constraints may be combined to yield the allowed\nrange in (\u03c1, \u03b7) space illustrated in Fig. 2. Smaller regions are quoted in other\nreviews 46 which view the theoretical sources of error differently.\n4.4\n\nUnitarity triangle\n\nThe unitarity of the CKM matrix implies that to the order we are considering,\n\u2217\nVub\n+ Vtd = A\u03bb3 . If this equation is divided by A\u03bb3 , one obtains a triangle in\nthe (\u03c1, \u03b7) complex plane whose vertices are at (0, 0) (internal angle \u03b3), (\u03c1, \u03b7)\n(internal angle \u03b1), and (1, 0) (internal angle \u03b2).\n10\n\n\fCP-violating asymmetries in certain B decays can measure such quantities\nas sin 2\u03b1 and sin 2\u03b2. The former, measured in B 0 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 with some corrections due to \"penguin\" diagrams, may occupy a wide range, as illustrated in\nFig. 2. The latter, measured in the \"golden mode\" B 0 \u2192 J/\u03c8KS with few\nuncertainties, is more constrained by other observables.\nThe goal of measurements of CP violation and other quantities in B decays\nwill be to test the consistency of this picture and to either restrict the parameter space further, thus providing a reliable target for future theories of these\nparameters, or to expose inconsistencies that will point to new physics. Hence\npart of the program will be to overconstrain the unitarity triangle, measuring\nboth sides and angles in several different types of processes. While we discuss\nsuch measurements based on B mesons, Buchalla 33 describes how, for example, K + \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03bd \u03bd\u0304 constrains the combination |1 \u2212 \u03c1 \u2212 i\u03b7 + 0.44|, where the last\nterm is a charmed quark correction to the dominant top quark contribution,\nand the purely CP-violating process KL \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03bd \u03bd\u0304 constrains \u03b7.\n5\n5.1\n\nMixing of neutral B mesons\nMass matrix formalism\n0\n\nWe shall work in a two-component basis utilizing the states (B 0 , B ).

The intermediate states dominating the\nloop calculation of \u039312 have typical mass scales mb , whereas loop momenta of\norder mt give rise to the main contributions to M12 .\nNeglecting \u2206\u0393 and performing time integrals, one finds\nZ \u221e\nZ \u221e\nx2d\n2 + x2d\n,\n\u0393\ndt|f\u2212 (t)|2 =\n,\n(31)\n\u0393\ndt|f+ (t)|2 =\n2\n2(1 + xd )\n2(1 + x2d )\n0\n0\nwhere xd \u2261 \u2206mBd /\u0393Bd , and Bd is another name for B 0 = b\u0304d to distinguish\nit from Bs = b\u0304s. The sum of the two terms is 1. The first term is 1 for\nxd = 0, approaches 1/2 for xd \u2192 \u221e, and is about 0.82 for the actual value\nxd = 0.754 \u00b1 0.027. The second term is 0 for xd = 0, approaches 1/2 for\nxd \u2192 \u221e, and is about 0.18 in actuality. Thus a neutral non-strange B of a\n0\ngiven flavor (B 0 or B ) has about 18% probability of decaying as the opposite\nflavor.\n6\n6.1\n\nCP violation\nAsymmetry: general remarks\n0\n\n0\nWe wish to compare hf |Bt=0\n(t)i and hf |B t=0 (t)i, where f is a final state and\nf \u2261 (CP )f .

(a) If there is a single\nstrong eigenchannel, final-state strong interaction phases in x or x\u0304 cancel, since\nthe numerator and denominator refer to the same final state. Then x\u0304 = x\u2217 ,\nsince weak phases flip sign under CP. (b) Recall that |q/p| is nearly 1 for B\nmesons. (For non-strange B's, we found q/p \u2243 e\u22122i\u03b2 .) Combining (a) and (b),\nwe find \u03bb\u03040 = \u03bb\u22170 for these cases.\n6.2\n\nTime-dependent asymmetry\n0\n\nAccording to Eq. (33), the rates for a (B 0 , B ) produced at t = 0 to evolve to\nthe respective final states (f, f ) at a time t are\n0\nd\u0393(Bt=0\n\u2192 f )/dt \u223c |f+ (t) + \u03bb0 f\u2212 (t)|2\n\n0\nd\u0393(B t=0\n\n\u2192 f )/dt \u223c |f+ (t) + \u03bb\u03040 f\u2212 (t)|\n\n2\n\n,\n\n(35)\n\n,\n\n(36)\n\nwith the coefficients of proportionality identical if there is a single strong eigenchannel. Now consider the case of a CP-eigenstate f such that f = \u00b1f . Then\nwe have not only x\u0304 = x\u2217 (see above), but also x\u0304 = x\u22121 , so |x| = 1. In that case,\nwhen |q/p| = 1 as is the case for neutral B's, we have |\u03bb0 | = 1 and \u03bb\u03040 = \u03bb\u22170 .\nThen\n|f+ + \u03bb0 f\u2212 |2 = e\u2212\u0393t cos\n\n\u2206mt\n\u2206mt\n+ i\u03bb0 sin\n2\n2\n\n= e\u2212\u0393t [1 \u2212 Im\u03bb0 sin \u2206mt]\n\n\u2192 f )/dt \u223c e\n\n\u2212\u0393t\n\n(37)\n\n,\n\n0\nd\u0393(Bt=0\n\u2192 f )/dt \u223c e\u2212\u0393t [1 \u2212 Im\u03bb0 sin \u2206mt]\n\n0\nd\u0393(B t=0\n\n2\n\n[1 + Im\u03bb0 sin \u2206mt]\n\n(38)\n,\n.\n\n(39)\n\nThe second term in each of these equations consists of an exponential decay\nmodulated by a sinusoidal oscillation. The time-dependent asymmetry is then\n0\n\nAf \u2261\n\n0\nd\u0393(Bt=0\n\u2192 f )/dt \u2212 d\u0393(B t=0 \u2192 f )/dt\n0\n\n0\nd\u0393(Bt=0\n\u2192 f )/dt + d\u0393(B t=0 \u2192 f )/dt\n\n= \u2212Im\u03bb0 sin \u2206mt\n\n.\n\n(40)\n\nWhen \u2206m/\u0393 \u226b 1, the wiggles in Eqs. (39) average out, and not much timeintegrated asymmetry is possible, while when \u2206m/\u0393 \u226a 1, the decay occurs\n15\n\n\fbefore there is time for oscillations. The maximal time-integrated asymmetry\noccurs when \u2206m/\u0393 = 1.\nWhen more than one eigenchannel is present, the condition |\u03bb0 | = 1 need\nnot be satisfied, so that the terms cos2 (\u2206mt/2) and sin2 (\u2206mt/2) in (37) need\nnot have the same coefficients, and a cos \u2206mt term is generated in the rates.\nThis is the signal of \"direct\" CP violation, as will be discussed below. Its\npresence for B \u2192 \u03c0\u03c0 was pointed out by London and Peccei 53 and by Gronau.54\n6.3\n\nTime-integrated asymmetry\n0\n\n0\nIf one integrates the rates for Bt=0\n\u2192 f and B t=0 \u2192 f , one can form the\n55\ntime-integrated asymmetry\n0\n\nCf \u2261\n\n0\n\u0393(Bt=0\n\u2192 f ) \u2212 \u0393(B t=0 \u2192 f )\n0\n\n0\n\u0393(Bt=0\n\u2192 f ) + \u0393(B t=0 \u2192 f )\n\n.\n\n(41)\n0\n\nIf we consider the cases (as above) in which |hf |B 0 i| = |hf |B i|, we just need\nthe integral\nZ \u221e\n1 xd\n,\n(42)\ndt sin(\u2206mt)e\u2212\u0393t =\n\u0393\n1 + x2d\n0\nand we then find\nCf = \u2212\n\nxd\nIm\u03bb0\n1 + x2d\n\n(43)\n\nwhen |x| = 1. This is indeed maximal when xd = 1; the coefficient of \u2212Im\u03bb0\nis 1/2. For the actual value of xd \u2243 0.75, the coefficient is 0.48 instead, very\nclose to its maximal value.\n6.4\n\nSpecific examples in decays to CP eigenstates\n\nWhen f is a CP eigenstate, a CP-violating difference between the rates for\n0\nB 0 \u2192 f and B \u2192 f arises as a result of interference between the direct decays\n0\n0\nand those proceeding via mixing (i.e., B 0 \u2192 B \u2192 f and B \u2192 B 0 \u2192 f ).\nThe second term in Eqs. (39) is the result of this mixing. As mentioned, the\nrate asymmetry goes to zero when xd \u2192 0 or xd \u2192 \u221e. We now illustrate the\ncalculation for two specific examples, B 0 \u2192 J/\u03c8KS and B 0 \u2192 \u03c0\u03c0.\n\nThe \"golden mode\": J/\u03c8KS\nThe quark subprocess governing B 0 \u2192 J/\u03c8KS is b\u0304 \u2192 c\u0304cs\u0304, whose CKM\nfactor is Vcb\u2217 Vcs . The KS is produced through its K 0 component. The cor0\n0\nresponding decay B \u2192 J/\u03c8KS proceeds via b \u2192 cc\u0304s and involves the K\ncomponent of KS .\n16\n\n\f0\n\nFor a CP-eigenstate, we defined x \u2261 hf |B i/hf |B 0 i and \u03bb0 = (q/p)x, but\n0\nf\nf\nwhat we actually calculate is hf |B i/hf |B 0 i where f = \u03b7CP\nf with \u03b7CP\n= \u00b11.\nf\nFor f = J/\u03c8KS , \u03b7CP = \u22121. To show this, note that CP |KS i = |KS i and\nCP |J/\u03c8i = |J/\u03c8i (since J/\u03c8 has odd C and P). The decay of the spin-zero\nB 0 to the spin-one J/\u03c8 and the spin-zero KS produces the final particles in\na state of orbital angular momentum l = 1 and hence odd parity, introducing\nan additional factor of \u22121. Then\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\nhKS |K ihK |B i\nx=\u2212\nhKS |K 0 ihK 0 |B 0 i\n\n.\n\n(44)\n\n(A good discussion of the sign is given by Bigi and Sanda.56 ) Now |KS i =\n0\n0\n\u2217\npK |K 0 i + qK |K i, so that hKS |K i = qK\nand hKS |K 0 i = p\u2217K . These numbers\n\u221a\n0\nare very close to 1/ 2. If the loop calculation of M12 for K 0 \u2013K mixing is\n\u2217\n\u2217\ndominated by the charmed quark, then (qK /pK ) \u2243 (Vcd Vcs\n)/(Vcd\nVcs ), and\n\u03bb0 = \u2212\n\n\u2217\n\u2217\nVcd\nVcs Vcb Vcs\nVtd Vtb\u2217\n\u2217 V \u2217V V \u2217V\nVcd Vcs\ncb cs td tb\n\n.\n\n(45)\n\nWe assumed a specific quark to dominate the calculation of M12 to illustrate\nthe self-consistency of the expression for \u03bb0 with with respect to redefinition of\nquark phases. Note first of all that the denominator is the complex conjugate of\nthe numerator. Then note that each quark is represented by the same number\nof V 's and V \u2217 's in the numerator: 2 for the charmed quark and 1 each for\nd, s, b, and t. Thus any phase rotation of a quark field leaves the expression\ninvariant. (Bjorken and Dunietz have introduced a nice representation of this\ninvariance.57 ) The same cancellation would have occurred if we were to say\n0\nanother quark dominated K 0 \u2013K mixing.\nFor the final state f = J/\u03c8KS we thus find \u03bb0 = \u2212e\u22122i\u03b2 and Im \u03bb0 =\nsin 2\u03b2, leading to the time-integrated rate asymmetry CJ/\u03c8KS = \u2212xd sin 2\u03b2/(1+\nx2d ). In practice the experiments often select events occurring for a proper time\nt \u2265 t0 > 0 in order to enhance the signal/noise ratio, so that analyses are usually based on the time-dependent asymmetry mentioned earlier.\nSome recent results on sin 2\u03b2 58\u221262 are quoted in Table 3, and \u00b11\u03c3 limits\nfrom the average are plotted in Fig. 2. While the central value is somewhat\nbelow that favored by other observables, there is no significant discrepancy.\nThe \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 mode and its complications\nThe main subprocess in B 0 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 is the \"tree\" diagram in which\nb\u0304 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u016b, with the spectator d combining with the \u016b to make a \u03c0 \u2212 .

Both have weak phases \u03b3 = Arg(Vub\nVus ).\n\u2217\nThere is a penguin amplitude\n[as in Fig. 3(b)] with weak phase \u03c0 = Arg(Vtb Vts ).\n\u221a\n \u0304 the colorSince \u03c0 0 = (dd \u0304 \u2212 u\u016b)/ 2 in a phase convention in which \u03c0 + = ud,\n0\nfavored tree and\u221apenguin amplitudes are the same as that in B \u2192 K + \u03c0 \u2212 ,\nbut divided by 2.

This process is expected to be dominated by the penguin\namplitude and thus provides a reference for comparison with other processes\nin which tree amplitudes participate.\nSmall contributions to B + \u2192 K + \u03c0 0 and B + \u2192 K 0 \u03c0 + are possible from\nthe process in which the b\u0304u pair annihilates into a weak current which then\nproduces s\u0304u. A q q\u0304 pair is produced in hadronization, giving K + \u03c0 0 if q = u and\nK 0 \u03c0 + if q = d. These contributions are expected to be suppressed by a factor\n20\n\n\fof fB /mB if the graphs describing them can be taken literally. However, they\ncan also be generated by rescattering from other contributions, e.g., (B + \u2192\nK + \u03c0 0 )tree \u2192 K 0 \u03c0 + . We shall mention tests for such effects in Sec. 12.\n7.2\n\nPocket guide to direct CP asymmetries\n\nWe now indicate a necessary (but not sufficient) condition for the observability\nof direct CP asymmetries based on the interference of two amplitudes, one\nweaker than the other. The result is that one must be able to detect processes\nat the level of the absolute square of the weaker amplitude.66 This guides the\nchoice of processes in which one might hope to see direct CP-violating rate\nasymmetries.\nSuppose the weak phase difference \u2206\u03c6 and the strong phase difference \u2206\u03b4\nare both near \u00b1\u03c0/2 (the most favorable case for detection of an asymmetry).\nThen the asymmetry A in Eq.

Then the significance of the asymmetry (in\nnumber of standard deviations) is\np\nA\n\u223c O(2 N2 ) .\n\u03b4A\n\n(53)\n\nThus (aside from the factor of 2) one must be able to see the square of the\nweaker amplitude at a significant level in order to see a significant asymmetry\ndue to A1 \u2013A2 interference.\n7.3\n\nInteresting levels for charmless B decays\n\nTypical branching ratios for the dominant B decays to pairs of light pseudoscalar mesons are in the range of 1 to 2 parts in 105 .

This conclusion is supported by an estimate of the tree\ncontribution via the decay B \u2192 \u03c0l\u03bd and factorization. One then needs some\nidea of the form factor at m(l\u03bd) = m\u03c0 or mK .

This would correspond to about 100 fb\u22121 at e+ e\u2212\ncolliders, or samples of about 108 identified B's at hadron machines. In other\nwords, one needs to be able to see branching ratios of a few parts in 107 with\ngood statistical significance. This is within the capabilities of experiments just\nnow getting under way.\n8\n8.1\n\nFlavor tagging\nStates of B B\u0304 with definite charge-conjugation\n\nThe process e+ e\u2212 \u2192 B B\u0304 is typically studied at the mass of the \u03a5(4S) resonance, Ec.m. = 10.58 GeV, above the threshold of 2MB = 10.56 GeV for\nB B\u0304 production but below the threshold for production of one or two B \u2217 's:\n22\n\n\fMB + MB \u2217 = 10.605 GeV, 2MB \u2217 = 10.65 GeV. Now, the \u03a5(4S) has C = \u22121.\nIt is produced via a virtual photon \u03b3 \u2217 (which has odd C). It is a 3 S1 bb\u0304 state,\nwhere the superscript 2Sbb\u0304 + 1 denotes the total spin Sbb\u0304 = 1. The bb\u0304 pair has\norbital angular momentum L = 0 and total angular momentum J = 1. A QQ\u0304\nstate 2S+1 LJ in general has C = (\u22121)L+S .\nThe B B\u0304 pair produced at the \u03a5(4S) thus has a definite eigenvalue of\ncharge-conjugation, C(B B\u0304) = \u22121, correlating the flavor flavor of the neutral\nB whose decay (e.g., to J/\u03c8KS ) is being studied with the flavor of the other B\nused to \"tag\" the decay, e.g., via a semileptonic decay b \u2192 cl\u2212 \u03bd\u0304l or b\u0304 \u2192 c\u0304l+ \u03bdl .\n0\nLet B 0 B be in an eigenstate of C with eigenvalue \u03b7C = \u00b11. (To get a state\n\u2217\n\n0\u2217\n\n0\n\nwith \u03b7C = +1 it is sufficient to utilize the reaction e+ e\u2212 \u2192 B 0 B or B 0 B \u2192\n0\n0\nB 0 B \u03b3 just above threshold.)

For \u03b7C = \u22121, write the decay amplitude\nas a function of t and t. It will have two terms, one \u223c e\u2212i(mH t+mL t) and\nthe other \u223c e\u2212i(mL t+mH t) , whose interference in the absolute square of the\namplitude gives rise to the sin \u2206m(t \u2212 t) terms.) These results have some\nnotable properties.\n(1) For either value of \u03b7C , the sum of the l+ and l\u2212 results is as if one\ndidn't tag, and the oscillatory terms cancel one another.\n(2) For \u03b7C = \u22121, note the antisymmetry with respect to t \u2212 t. This is a\nconsequence of the Bose statistics and the C = \u22121 nature of the initial state.\nIf one integrates over all times, the CP-violating asymmetry vanishes. Thus\nin order for the tagging method to work in a C-odd state like \u03a5(4S) one must\nknow whether t or t was earlier. An asymmetric B-factory like PEP-II or\nKEK-B permits this by spreading out the decay using a Lorentz boost.\nExercise: Show for \u03b7C = \u22121 that if one subdivides the t, t integrations\naccording to t < t or t > t, then\nRR\ndtdt(d2 \u0393/dtdt)[(l\u2212 , t > t) \u2212 (l\u2212 , t < t) \u2212 (l+ , t > t) + (l+ , t < t)]\nRR\ndtdt(d2 \u0393/dtdt)[(l\u2212 , t > t) + (l\u2212 , t < t) + (l+ , t > t) + (l+ , t < t)]\n=\u2212\n\nxd\nIm\u03bb\n1 + x2d\n\n.\n\n(63)\n\nIn practice the BaBar and Belle analyses will probably fit the time distributions rather than simply subdividing them, since background rejection and\nsignal/noise ratio are functions of t \u2212 t.\n(3) For \u03b7C = +1 the oscillatory term behaves as \u223c \u2206m(t + t), so it is\nnot necessary to know whether t or t was earlier, and the asymmetric collision\ngeometry is not needed. However, as shown above, in order to produce a\n0\nB 0 B state with \u03b7C = +1 in e+ e\u2212 collisions one must work at or above B B\u0304 \u2217\nthreshold, thereby losing the cross section advantage of the \u03a5(4S) resonance.\n24\n\n\f8.2\n\nUncorrelated B B\u0304 pairs\n\nPairs of B's produced in a hadronic environment are likely to arise from independent fragmentation of b and b\u0304 quarks, so that it is unlikely that they are\nproduced in a state of definite \u03b7C . (The interesting case of partially-correlated\nB-B\u0304 pairs can be attacked by density-matrix methods.73 ) Thus, one must resort to either the fact that a b is always produced in association with a b\u0304 by\nthe strong interactions (\"opposite-side tagging\"), or the fact that the fragmen0\ntation of a b into a B favors one particular sign of charged pion close to the\n0\nB in phase space (\"same-side tagging\").\n\"Opposite-side\" methods\nThe strong interactions q q\u0304 \u2192 bb\u0304 or gg \u2192 bb\u0304 (g = gluon) conserve beauty,\nso that a b can be identified if it is found to be produced in association with a\nb\u0304. The opposite-side b\u0304 can be identified in several ways.\n(1) The jet-charge method makes use of the fact that a jet tends to carry\nthe charge of its leading quark 74 , since the average charge of the fragmentation\nproducts is zero in the flavor-SU(3) limit. (There is some delicacy if strange\nquark production is suppressed, since Q(u) 6= \u2212Q(d).75 )\n(2) The lepton-tag method uses the charge of the lepton in the semileptonic\ndecays b \u2192 cl\u2212 \u03bd\u0304l and b\u0304 \u2192 c\u0304l+ \u03bdl to signify the flavor of the decaying oppositeside b quark. The signal is diluted since semileptonic decays occur after the b\nquark has been incorporated into a meson. Sometimes this meson is a neutral\nB, in which case information on its flavor is nearly completely lost if it is a\nstrange B and partially lost if it is a nonstrange B. An initial B s will decay\n0\nhalf the time as a Bs , while an initial B will decay about 18% of the time as\na B 0 . (See Section 5.2.)\n(3) The kaon-tag method uses the fact that the signs of kaons produced in\nb decays are correlated with the flavor of the decaying b. A b gives rise to c,\nwhose products have more K \u2212 than K + . This method is subject to the same\ndilution as the lepton-tag method.\nIn order to utilize the above methods, one needs the relative probabilities\nof production of B 0 , B + , Bs , and \u039bb , The CDF Collaboration 76 has measured\nthese in high-energy hadron collisions to be in the ratios 0.375:0.375:0.16:0.09,\nwhile LEP Collaborations find 0.40:0.40:0.097:0.104 for Z 0 \u2192 bb\u0304 decays.77 Tak0\ning account of P (B 0 \u2192 B ) \u2243 18% and P (Bs \u2192 B s ) \u2243 1/2, the probability of\na \"wrong\" tag is (3/8)(0.18) + (0.16)(1/2) \u2243 0.15, which dilutes the efficacy of\nthe tag by a factor (right \u2013 wrong)/(right + wrong) \u2243 0.70.\nFor an extensive study of the first two tagging methods, see recent papers\nby the CDF Collaboration.78 These methods were a key ingredient in obtaining\n25\n\n\f(a)\n\n(b)\n\nb\n\nb\n\nB0\n\nB0\n\nd\nd\nu\n\nd\nd\n\n\u03c0+\n\n\u03c0-\n\nu\n0\n\nFigure 5: Fragmentation of a b\u0304 or b quark into a B 0 or B .\n\nthe CP-violating asymmetry in B 0 \u2192 J/\u03c8KS mentioned in Sec. 6.4.\n\"Same-side\" methods: Fragmentation and B \u2217\u2217 resonances\nThe fragmentation of a b quark into a neutral B meson is not chargesymmetric.

This correlation is the\nsame as that found in resonance decays: B 0 resonates with \u03c0 + but not \u03c0 \u2212 ,\n0\nwhile B resonates with \u03c0 \u2212 but not \u03c0 + .\nThe fragmentation of a b\u0304 or b quark is illustrated in Fig. 5. If one cuts the\ndiagrams to the left of the pion emission, one finds either a b\u0304u or a b\u016b state.\nThus, a positively charged resonance can decay to B 0 \u03c0 + , while a negatively\n0\ncharged one can decay to B \u03c0 \u2212 .\nRecall the case of D\u2217+ \u2192 \u03c0 + D0 mentioned in Sec. 3.1. The soft pion in\nthat decay may be used to tag the flavor of the neutral D at the time of its\n0\nproduction, which is useful if one wants to study D0 \u2013D mixing or Cabibbodisfavored decays. The difference between M (D\u2217+ ) and M (\u03c0 + ) + M (D0 ) (the\n\"Q-value\") is only about 5 MeV, so the pion is nearly at rest in the D\u2217+\nc.m.s., and hence kinematically very distinctive. In the case of B's, however,\nthe lowest vector meson B \u2217+ cannot decay to \u03c0 + B 0 since the B \u2217 \u2013B mass\ndifference is only about 46 MeV. One must then utilize the decays of highermass B \u2217 's, collectively known as B \u2217\u2217 's. The lightest such states consist of a b\nquark and a light quark (u, d, s) in a P-wave.\n26\n\n\fTable 5: Quantum numbers of B \u2217\u2217 resonances (P-wave resonances between a b\u0304 quark and a\nlight quark q).\n\njq\n1/2\n1/2\n3/2\n3/2\n\nJ\n0\n1\n1\n2\n\nDecay prods.\nB\u03c0\nB\u2217\u03c0\nB\u2217\u03c0\nB\u03c0, B \u2217 \u03c0\n\nPart. wave\nS wave\nS wave\nD wave\nD wave\n\nWidth\nBroad\nBroad\nNarrow\nNarrow\n\nMany key features of the spectroscopy of a heavy quark and a light one\nwere first pointed out in the case of charm,81,82 and codified using heavy-quark\nsymmetry.83 The heavy quark spin degrees of freedom nearly decouple from the\nlight-quark and gluon dynamics, so it makes sense to first couple the relative\nangular momentum L = 1 and the light-quark spin sq = 1/2 to states of total\nlight-quark angular momentum jq = 1/2 or 3/2 and then to couple jq with the\nheavy quark spin SQ\u0304 = 1/2 to form total angular momentum J. For jq = 1/2\none then gets states with J = 0, 1, while for jq = 3/2 one gets states with\nJ = 1, 2. The jq = 1/2 states decay to B\u03c0 or B \u2217 \u03c0 only via S-waves, while the\njq = 3/2 states decay to B\u03c0 or B \u2217 \u03c0 only via D-waves. These properties are\nsummarized in Table 5.\nThe jq = 3/2 resonances, decaying via D-waves, have been seen, with typical widths of tens of MeV and masses somewhere between 5.7 and 5.8 GeV/c2\nin all analyses.84,85 The jq = 1/2 resonances are expected to be considerably\nbroader. There is no unanimity on their properties, but evidence exists for at\nleast one of their charmed counterparts.86 More information on B \u2217\u2217 's would\nenhance their usefulness in same-side tagging of neutral B mesons.\n9\n9.1\n\nThe strange B\nBs \u2013B s mixing\n\nThe limit 44 \u2206ms > 15 ps\u22121 mentioned in Sec. 4.4 was a significant source of\nconstraint on the (\u03c1, \u03b7) plot.

One estimates the ratios of |\u03a8(0)|2 in D and Ds systems from strong\nhyperfine splittings. Since M (D\u2217+ ) \u2212 M (D+ ) \u2243 M (Ds\u2217+ ) \u2212 M (Ds+ ), one expects |\u03a8(0)|2Qd\u0304 /md \u2243 |\u03a8(0)|2Qs\u0304 /ms for mesons containing a heavy quark Q. In\n\u221a\nconstituent-quark models 88 md /ms \u2243 0.64, so fQd\u0304 /fQs\u0304 \u2243 0.64 = 0.8. An\nupper limit on |Vts /Vtd | (see Sec. 4.3) is then \u2264 [\u03bb(0.66)]\u22121 = 6.9, implying\n\u2206ms /\u2206md \u2264 74 or \u2206ms \u2264 36 ps\u22121 . A recent prediction 89 based on lattice\nestimates for decay constants is \u2206ms = 16.2 \u00b1 2.1 \u00b1 3.4 ps\u22121 ; there is a hint\nof a signal at \u223c 17 ps\u22121 .44\n9.2\n\nBs lifetime\n\nThe mass eigenstates of the strange B are expected to be nearly CP eigenstates.\nTheir mass splitting is expected to be correlated with their mixing; large values\nof \u2206ms imply large values of \u2206\u0393s . (In the calculation of \u2206\u0393/ \u2206m, the values\nof |fM |2 cancel.)\nThe value of \u2206\u0393s is much greater than that of \u2206\u0393d because of the shared\nintermediate states in the transition B s = bs\u0304 \u2192 sc\u0304cs\u0304 \u2192 sb\u0304 = Bs illustrated\nin Fig. 6. Specific calculations 90 imply that this quark subprocess may be\ndominated by CP = + intermediate states, implying a shorter lifetime for the\neven-CP eigenstate of the B s \u2013Bs system by O(10%).\nThe imaginary part of the diagram in Fig. 6 is due to on-shell states, which\ndo not include those involving the top quark. This is the reason for the factor\n2\nof (m2b /m2W )/S(m2t /MW\n) in Eq. (30). The lowest-order ratio, \u2206\u0393s /\u2206ms \u2243\n\u22121/180, implies that if |\u2206ms /\u0393s | = (20 ps\u22121 )(1.6 ps) = 32 (a reasonable\nvalue), then |\u2206\u0393s /\u0393s | \u2243 1/6. Recent calculations predict \u2206\u0393s /\u0393s = (9.3+3.4\n\u22124.6 )%\np\n91\nor (4.7\u00b11.5\u00b11.6)% 92. The latter group 93 also finds fBd BBd = 206(28)(7)\np\np\n\u221a\nMeV, fBs BBs /(fB BB ) = 1.16(7), fBs BBs = 237(18)(8) MeV.\n28\n\n\f9.3\n\nMeasuring \u2206\u0393s /\u0393s\n\nThe average decay rate of the two mass eigenstates BH and BL can be measured by observing a flavor-specific decay, e.g.,\nBs (= b\u0304s) \u2192 Ds\u2212 (= c\u0304s)l+ \u03bdl or Bs \u2192 Ds\u2212 \u03c0 + ,\n\nDs\u2212 \u2192 \u03c6\u03c0 \u2212\n\n.\n\n(65)\n\nThe flavor of Ds labels the flavor of the Bs and then we note that\n1\n|Bs i \u2243 \u221a (|BL i + |BH i)\n2\n\n.\n\n(66)\n\nSuch a flavor-specific decay then gives a rate \u0393\u0304 = (\u0393L + \u0393H )/2.\nOne can also look for a decay in which the CP of the final state can\nbe easily identified.94 Bs \u2192 J/\u03c8\u03c6 is such a final state; one can perform a\nhelicity analysis to learn its CP eigenvalue (or whether it is a mixture). Since\nJ(J/\u03c8) = J(\u03c6) = 1 and J(Bs ) = 0, the final state can have orbital angular\nmomenta l = 0, 1, and 2. Exercise: Show that l = 0, 2 corresponds to even,\nand l = 1 to odd CP.\n9.4\n\nHelicity analyses of Bs \u2192 J/\u03c8\u03c6 and B \u2192 J/\u03c8K \u2217\n\nIt is convenient to re-express the three partial wave amplitudes for decay of\na spin-zero mesons into two massive spin-1 mesons in terms of transversity\namplitudes.95 These are most easily visualized by analogy with the method\noriginally used to determine the parity of the neutral pion through its decay\nto two photons.\nA spinless meson M can decay to two photons with two possible linear polarization states: parallel and perpendicular to each other. If they have parallel\npolarizations, the interaction Lagrangian is Lint \u223c M F\u03bc\u03bd F \u03bc\u03bd \u223c M (E2 \u2212 B2 ),\nwhile if they have perpendicular polarizations, Lint \u223c M F\u03bc\u03bd F\u0303 \u03bc\u03bd \u223c M (E * B).\nNow, E2 \u2212 B is CP-even, while E * B is CP-odd. The observation that the two\nphotons emitted by the \u03c0 0 had perpendicular polarizations then was used to\ninfer that the pion had odd CP and hence (since its C was even as a result of\nits coupling to two photons) odd P.\nOne can then identify two of the decay amplitudes for a spinless meson\ndecaying to two massive vector mesons as Ak (parallel linear polarizations,\neven CP) and A\u22a5 (perpendicular linear polarizations, odd CP). A third decay\namplitude is peculiar to the massive vector meson case: Both vector mesons\ncan have longitudinal polarizations (impossible for photons). Since there must\nbe two independent CP-even decay amplitudes by the partial-wave exercise\ngiven above, this amplitude, which we call A0 , must be CP-even.\n29\n\n\fThere are two recent experimental studies of decays of strange B's to pairs\nof vector mesons. (1) The CDF Collaboration 96 finds the results quoted in\nTable 6. The decays Bs \u2192 J/\u03c8\u03c6 and B 0 \u2192 J/\u03c8K \u22170 are related to one another\nby flavor SU(3) (the interchange s \u2194 d for the spectator quark) and thus should\nhave similar amplitude structure. We have adopted a normalization in which\n|A0 |2 + |Ak |2 + |A\u22a5 |2 = 1. The CDF result says that Bs \u2192 J/\u03c8\u03c6 is dominantly\nCP-even. No significant \u2206\u0393/\u0393 has been detected, but the sensitivity is not\nyet adequate to reach predicted levels. These conclusions are supported by\nresults from CLEO 97 (|A0 |2 = 0.52 \u00b1 0.08, |A\u22a5 |2 = 0.09 \u00b1 0.08) and BaBar 98\n(|A0 |2 = 0.60 \u00b1 0.06 \u00b1 0.04, |A\u22a5 |2 = 0.13 \u00b1 0.06 \u00b1 0.02).\nTable 6: Amplitudes in the decays Bs \u2192 J/\u03c8\u03c6 and B 0 \u2192 J/\u03c8K \u22170 .\n\nAmplitudes\n|A0 |\n|Ak |\nArg(Ak /A0 )\n|A\u22a5 |\nArg(A\u22a5 /A0 )\n\u0393L /\u0393 = |A0 |2\n\u0393\u22a5 /\u0393 = |A\u22a5 |2\n\nBs \u2192 J/\u03c8\u03c6\n0.78 \u00b1 0.09 \u00b1 0.01\n0.41 \u00b1 0.23 \u00b1 0.05\n1.1 \u00b1 1.3 \u00b1 0.2\n0.48 \u00b1 0.20 \u00b1 0.04\n0.61 \u00b1 0.14 \u00b1 0.02\n0.23 \u00b1 0.19 \u00b1 0.04\n\nB 0 \u2192 J/\u03c8K \u22170\n0.77 \u00b1 0.04 \u00b1 0.01\n0.53 \u00b1 0.11 \u00b1 0.04\n2.2 \u00b1 0.5 \u00b1 0.1\n0.36 \u00b1 0.16 \u00b1 0.08\n\u22120.6 \u00b1 0.5 \u00b1 0.1\n0.59 \u00b1 0.06 \u00b1 0.01\n0.13+0.12\n\u22120.09 \u00b1 0.06\n(\u2217)+\n\n(\u2217)\u2212\n\n(2) A recent ALEPH analysis 99 of the decays Bs \u2192 Ds Ds\nfinds\nthat the decay to pairs of vector mesons occurs in mostly even partial waves,\nso that the lifetime in this mode probes that\n\u221a of the CP-even mass eigenstate,\nwhich turns out to be BL \u2243 (Bs + B s )/ 2, giving \u03c4L = 1.27 \u00b1 0.33 \u00b1 0.07\nps. A similar study of the flavor eigenstate finds \u03c4 (Bs ) = 1.54 \u00b1 0.07 ps.\nComparing the two values, one finds \u2206\u0393/\u0393 = (25+21\n\u221214 )%. This is just one facet\nof a combined analysis of results from CDF, LEP, and SLD 100 that concludes\n\u2206\u0393/\u0393 = (16+8\n\u22129 )%, or \u2206\u0393/\u0393 < 31% at 95% c.l.\n10\n\nB decays to pairs of light mesons\n\nWe have already noted in Table 4 some branching ratios for B decays to pairs\nof light pseudoscalar mesons. Here we discuss these and related processes\ninvolving one or two light vector mesons in more detail.\n10.1\n\nDominant processes in B \u2192 \u03c0\u03c0 and B \u2192 K\u03c0\n\nThe decays B \u2192 \u03c0\u03c0 and B \u2192 K\u03c0 are rich in possibilities for determining\nfundamental CKM parameters. The process B 0 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 could yield the angle\n30\n\n\f\u03b1 in the absence of penguin amplitudes, whose contribution must therefore be\ntaken into account. The process B 0 \u2192 K + \u03c0 \u2212 and related decays can provide\ninformation on the weak phase \u03b3.\nIn order to discuss such decays in a unified way, we shall employ a flavorSU(3) description using a graphical representation.101,102 This language is equivalent to tensorial methods.103,104 The graphs are shown in Fig. 7. They constitute an over-complete set; all processes of the form B \u2192 P P , where P is a\nlight pseudoscalar meson belonging to a flavor octet, are described by only 5\nindependent linear combinations of these.\nThe graphical technique allows one to check a result for B \u2192 \u03c0\u03c0 which\ncan be obtained using isospin invariance. The subprocess b\u0304 \u2192 \u016bud \u0304 can change\nisospin by 1/2 or 3/2 units. The J = 0 \u03c0\u03c0 final state, by virtue of Bose\nstatistics, must have even isospin: I = 0, 2. Thus there are only two invariant\namplitudes in the problem, one with \u2206I = 1/2 leading to I\u03c0\u03c0 = 0 and one\nwith \u2206I = 3/2 leading to I\u03c0\u03c0 = 2. Hence the amplitudes for the three decays\nB 0 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 , B + \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 0 , and B 0 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 obey one linear relation. In the\ngraphical representation they are\nA(B 0 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 ) = \u2212(T + P ) ,\n(67)\n\u221a\n+\n+ 0\nA(B \u2192 \u03c0 \u03c0 ) = \u2212(T + C)/ 2 ,\n(68)\n\u221a\n0\n0 0\n(69)\nA(B \u2192 \u03c0 \u03c0 ) = (P \u2212 C)/ 2 ,\n\u221a\n\u221a\nleading to the relation A(B 0 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 ) = 2A(B + \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 0 ) \u2212 2A(B 0 \u2192\n\u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 ). Measurement of the rates for these processes and their charge-conjugates\nallows one to separate the penguin and tree contributions from one another\nand to obtain information on the CKM phase \u03b1. The only potential drawback\nof this method is that the branching ratio for A(B 0 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 ) is expected to be\nsmall: of order 10\u22126 .\nOne can use B \u2192 K\u03c0 and flavor SU(3) to evaluate the penguin contribution to B \u2192 \u03c0\u03c0.105 The decay B \u2192 \u03c0\u03c0 appears to be dominated by the tree\namplitude while B \u2192 K\u03c0 appears to be dominated by the penguin:\n1\nfK Vus\n(Pen)\u03c0\u03c0\nVtd\n(Tree)K\u03c0\n\u2243\n\u2243\n\u2243\n\u2243\n(Tree)\u03c0\u03c0\nf\u03c0 Vud\n(Pen)K\u03c0\nVts\n4\n\n.\n\n(70)\n\nMany other applications of flavor SU(3) to B \u2192 K\u03c0 decays have been made\nsubsequently.106 We shall discuss the results of one relatively recent example.107\n10.2\n\nMeasuring \u03b3 with B \u2192 K\u03c0 decays\n\nThe Fermilab Tevatron and the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC) will produce large numbers of \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 , \u03c0 \u00b1 K \u2213 , and K + K \u2212 pairs from neutral non31\n\n\fT\n\nC\n\nE\n\nA\n\nP\n\nPA\n\nFigure 7: Graphs describing flavor-SU(3) invariant amplitudes for the decays of B mesons to\npairs of light flavor-octet pseudoscalar mesons.

Each set of decays has its own distinguishing\nfeatures.\nThe processes B 0 \u2192 K + K \u2212 and Bs \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 involve only the spectatorquark amplitudes E and P A, and thus should be suppressed.

Time-dependent studies of both processes allow one to\nseparate strong interaction and weak interaction information from one another\nand to measure the angle \u03b3.109 This appears to be a promising method for Run\nII at the Fermilab Tevatron.110\nThe decays of non-strange and strange neutral B mesons to K \u00b1 \u03c0 \u2213 provide\nanother source of information on \u03b3 107 when combined with information on\nB + \u2192 K 0 \u03c0 + .

We can label the corresponding amplitudes by a subscript V or P to denote the type of meson containing the spectator. A recent\nanalysis within the graphical framework uses data to specify amplitudes.70\nAlternatively, one can incorporate models for form factors into calculations\nbased on factorization.117,118 An interesting possibility suggested in both these\napproaches is that the large branching ratio B(B 0 \u2192 K \u2217+ \u03c0 \u2212 ) may suggest\nconstructive tree-penguin interference, implying \u03b3 \u2265 90\u25e6 .\n\u2217\nVus , with weak\nThe tree amplitude in B 0 \u2192 K \u2217+ \u03c0 \u2212 is proportional to Vub\n\u2217\nphase \u03b3, while the penguin amplitude is proportional to Vtb Vts , with weak phase\n\u03c0. The relative weak phase between these two amplitudes is then \u03b3 \u2212 \u03c0, which\nleads to constructive interference if the strong phase difference between the\ntree and penguin amplitudes is small and if \u0393 > \u03c0/2. This could help explain\nwhy B(B 0 \u2192 K \u2217+ \u03c0 \u2212 ) seems to exceed 2\u00d710\u22125 while the pure penguin process\n+2.0+0.7\nB \u2192 \u03c6K corresponds to a branching ratio of only (6.2\u22121.8\u22121.7\n) \u00d7 10\u22126 .69,119\n0\nA similar tree-penguin interference can occur in B \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 .

The relative weak phase is then\n\u03b3 + \u03b2 = \u03c0 \u2212 \u03b1. One expects destructive interference if the final strong phase\ndifference is small and \u03b1 < \u03c0/2.

The existence of three partial waves (S, P, D) for such processes as B 0 \u2192\n\u03c6K \u22170 means that helicity analyses can in principle detect the presence of finalstate interactions (as in the case of B \u2192 J/\u03c8K \u2217 ). It is not clear, however,\nwhether such final-state phases are relevant to the case of greatest interest, in\nwhich two different channels are \"fed\" by different weak processes such as T and\nP amplitudes.

One expects the assumption of flavor SU(3), and in particular the equality of final-state phases\nfor non-strange and strange B final states, to be more valid for B decays than\nfor charm decays, where resonances still are expected to play a major role.\n11\n11.1\n\nThe role of penguins\nEstimates of magnitudes\n\nPerturbative calculations of penguin contributions to processes such as B \u2192\nK\u03c0, where they seem to be dominant, fall short of actual measurements.122\nPhenomenological fits indicate no suppression by a factor of \u03b1s /4\u03c0 despite the\npresence of a loop and a gluon. One possible explanation is the presence of a cc\u0304\nloop with substantial enhancement from on-shell states, equivalent to strong\nrescattering from such states as Ds D\u0304 to charmless meson pairs. If this is indeed\nthe case, penguin amplitudes could have different final-state phases from tree\namplitudes, enhancing the possibility of observing direct CP violation.\n11.2\n\nElectroweak penguins\n\nWhen the gluon in a penguin diagram is replaced by a (real or virtual) photon\nor a virtual Z which couples to a final q q\u0304 pair, the process b\u0304 \u2192 (d \u0304 or s\u0304)q q\u0304 is no\nlonger independent of the flavor (u, d, s) of q. Instead, one has contributions in\nwhich the u\u016b pair is treated differently from the dd \u0304 or ss\u0304 pair. A color-favored\nelectroweak penguin amplitude PEW [Fig. 9(a)] involves the pair appearing in\nc\nthe same neutral meson (e.g., \u03c0 0 ), while a color-suppressed amplitude PEW\n[Fig. 9(b)] involves each member of the pair appearing in a different meson.\n36\n\n\fFigure 9: Electroweak penguin (EWP) diagrams. (a) Color-favored (PEW ); (b) Colorc\nsuppressed (PEW\n).\n\nOne may parametrize electroweak penguin (EWP) amplitudes by contributions proportional to the quark charge, sweeping other terms into the gluonic\npenguin contributions. One then finds that the EWP terms in a flavor-SU(3)\ndescription may be combined as follows with the terms T , C, P , and S (the\n\"singlet\") penguin: 123\n1 c\nc\n,\nT \u2192 t \u2261 T + PEW\n, P \u2192 p \u2261 P \u2212 PEW\n3\n1\nC \u2192 c \u2261 C + PEW , S \u2192 s \u2261 S \u2212 PEW .\n3\n\n(86)\n(87)\n\nThe flavor-SU(3) description holds as before, but weak phases now can differ\nfrom their previous values as a result of the EWP contributions.\nOne early application of flavor SU(3) which turns out to be significantly\naffected by EWP contributions is the attempt to learn the weak phase \u03b3 from\ninformation on the decays B + \u2192 K + \u03c0 0 , B + \u2192 K 0 \u03c0 + , B + \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 0 , and\nthe corresponding charge-conjugate decays.124 The amplitude construction is\nillustrated in Fig. 10.

The corresponding\n\u2206S = 0 amplitudes are unprimed.\nThe amplitudes in Fig. 10 form two triangles, whose sides labeled C \u2032 + T \u2032\nand C\u0304 \u2032 + T\u0304 \u2032 form an angle 2\u03b3 with respect to one another.

The present value for this ratio, based\non the branching ratios in Table 4, is 1.27 \u00b1 0.47, compatible with 1.\nThe triangle construction (with its generalization to include EWP contributions) avoids the need to evaluate strong phases.

Regge poles\nhave proven phenomenologically successful primarily for \"peripheral\" partial\nwaves l \u223c kc.m. \u00d7 (R \u223c 1 fm).132\n13\n13.1\n\nTopics not covered in detail\nMeasurement of \u03b3 using B \u00b1 \u2192 DK decays\n0\n\nThe self-tagging decays B \u00b1 \u2192 D0 K \u00b1 , B\u00b1 \u2192 D K \u00b1 , and B \u00b1 \u2192 DCP K \u00b1 ,\nwhere DCP is a CP eigenstate, permit one to perform a triangle construction very similar to that in Fig. 10 to extract the weak phase \u03b3.133 However,\nthe interference of the Cabibbo-favored decay D0 \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 + and the doublyCabibbo-suppressed decay D0 \u2192 K + \u03c0 \u2212 introduces an important subtlety in\nthis method, which has been addressed.134\n40\n\n\f13.2\n\nDalitz plot analyses\n\nThe likely scarcity of the decay B 0 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 (see Sec. 10) may be an important\nlimitation in the method proposed 135 to extract the weak phase \u03b1 from B \u2192 \u03c0\u03c0\ndecays using an isospin analysis. It has been suggested 136 that one study\ninstead the isospin structure of the decays B \u2192 \u03c1\u03c0, since at least some of\nthese processes occur with greater branching ratios than the corresponding\nB \u2192 \u03c0\u03c0 decays. One must thus measure time-dependences and total rates for\n0\nthe processes (B 0 or B ) \u2192 (\u03c1\u00b1 \u03c0 \u2213 , \u03c1\u03c0 0 ). A good deal of useful information,\nin fact, can be learned just from the time-integrated rates.137\n13.3\n\n0\n\nCP violation in B 0 \u2013B mixing\n\nThe standard model of CP violation predicts that the number of same-sign\n0\ndilepton pairs due to B 0 \u2013B mixing should be nearly the same for l+ l+ and\n\u2212 \u2212\nl l . By studying such pairs it is possible to test not only this prediction, but\nalso the validity of CPT invariance. The OPAL Collaboration 138 parametrizes\nneutral non-strange B mass eigenstates as\n0\n\n|B1 i =\n\n(1 + \u01ebB + \u03b4B )|B 0 i + (1 \u2212 \u01ebB \u2212 \u03b4B )|B i\np\n,\n2(1 + |\u01ebB + \u03b4B |2 )\n\n(90)\n\n0\n\n(1 + \u01ebB \u2212 \u03b4B )|B 0 i \u2212 (1 \u2212 \u01ebB + \u03b4B )|B i\np\n|B2 i =\n2(1 + |\u01ebB \u2212 \u03b4B |2 )\n\n(91)\n\nand finds (allowing for CPT violation) Im(\u03b4B ) = \u22120.020 \u00b1 0.016 \u00b1 0.006,\nRe(\u01ebB ) = \u22120.006\u00b10.010\u00b10.006. Enforcing CPT invariance, they find Re(\u01ebB ) =\n0.002 \u00b1 0.007 \u00b1 0.003. A recent CLEO study 139 finds Re(\u01ebB )/(1 + |\u01ebB |2 ) =\n0.0035 \u00b1 0.0103 \u00b1 0.0015 under similar assumptions. The standard model predicts |p/q| \u2243 1 and hence Re(\u01ebB ) \u2243 0.\n14\n14.1\n\nWhat if the CKM picture doesn't work?\nLikely accuracy of future measurements\n\nIt's useful to anticipate how our knowledge of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa\nmatrix might evolve over the next few years.140,141 With sin(2\u03b2) measured\nin B 0 \u2192 J/\u03c8KS decays to an accuracy of \u00b10.06 (the BaBar goal with 30\nfb\u22121 48 ), errors on |Vub /Vcb | reduced to 10%, strange-B mixing bounded by\nxs = \u2206ms /\u0393s > 20 (the present bound is already better than this!), and\nB(B + \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03bd\u03c4 ) measured to \u00b120% (giving fB |Vub , or |Vub / Vtd | when combined\n0\nwith B 0 \u2013B mixing), one finds the result shown in Fig. 11.\n41\n\n\fFigure 11: Plot in the (\u03c1, \u03b7) plane of anticipated \u00b11\u03c3 constraints on CKM parameters in\nthe year 2003. Solid curves: |Vub /Vcb |; dashed lines: constraint on |Vub /Vtd | by combining\n0\nmeasurement of B(B + \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03bd\u03c4 ) with B 0 \u2013B mixing; dotted lines: constraint due to \u01ebK\n0\n0\n(CP-violating K \u2013K mixing); dash-dotted line: limit due to xs ; solid rays: measurement\nof sin 2\u03b2 to \u00b10.06.\n\nThe anticipated (\u03c1, \u03b7) region is quite restricted, leading to the likelihood\nthat if physics beyond the standard model is present, it will show up in such\na plot as a contradiction among various measurements. What could be some\nsources of new physics?\n14.2\n\nPossible extensions\n\nSome sources of effects beyond the standard model which could show up first\nin studies of B mesons include:\n\u2022 Supersymmetry (nearly everyone's guess) (see Murayama's lectures 142 );\n\u2022 Flavor-changing effects from extended models of dynamical electroweak\nsymmetry breaking (mentioned, e.g., by Chivukula 143 );\n\u2022 Mixing of ordinary quarks with exotic ones, as in certain versions of\ngrand unified theories.144\n0\n\nTypical effects show up most prominently in mixing (particularly K 0 \u2013K\n0\nand B 0 \u2013B ),145 but also could appear in penguin processes such as B \u2192 \u03c6K.146\n42\n\n\f15\n\nSummary\n\nWe are entering an exciting era of precision B physics. With experimental and\ntheoretical advances occurring on many fronts, we have good reason to hope\nfor surprises in the next few years. If, however, the present picture survives\nsuch stringent tests, we should turn our attention to the more fundamental\nquestion of where the CKM matrix (as well as the quark masses themselves!)\nactually originates.\nAcknowledgments\nI would like to thank Prof. K.
