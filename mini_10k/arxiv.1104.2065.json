The structural details established for both cases and supplementary\ncalculations of the adsorbate system allow us to analyze the observed change of the work function.\nPACS numbers: 68.49.Uv, 68.43.Fg, 79.60.Fr\n\nThe adsorption of organic semiconductor molecules has\nbeen in the focus of numerous experimental and theoretical investigations \u2013 many of them addressing the subtle\ninterplay of electronic and structural properties. Early\nstudies [1], which show that the energy levels of organic\nsemiconductor/metal interfaces can exhibit large deviations from the Schottky-Mott relation, conveyed the significance of interface dipoles. Until today and despite the\nubiquity of this concept in the field of organic materials,\nthe origin of the interface dipole often remains vague.\nTo establish a better understanding of the energy level\nalignment at the interface one should not neglect effects\nrelated to the molecular structure of organic adsorbates:\nPlanar molecules such as F16 CuPc [2], PTCDA [3, 4]\nor pentacene derivatives [5], for example, can distort\nupon adsorption due to the interaction with the substrate and therefore exhibit an induced molecular dipole.\nNon-planar molecules such as TiOPc [6], SnPc [7\u20139],\nSubPc [10, 11] and VOPc [12], which may adsorb in\ndifferent orientations, form layers with at least partially\naligned dipole moments. Hence, for this class of systems\nthe orientational order on the surface is a quantity which\nstrongly influences the interface dipole. In particular, it\nhas been shown that depending on the orientation a layer\nof molecular dipoles p with an area density Ndip can shift\nthe vacuum level (VL) in either direction and, therefore,\nincrease or decrease the work function \u03a6 of the sample\naccording to [13]\n\u2206\u03a6dip = \u00b1epNdip/\u01eb0 \u01eb,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u01eb is the effective dielectric constant of the monolayer. An experimentally and theoretically challenging\nmodel system of non-planar organic molecules with a significant dipole moment, for which these effects can be directly studied, is chlorogallium phthalocyanine (GaClPc,\n\nFig. 1) [14].\nIn this letter, we present a detailed study on the bonding and orientational ordering of GaClPc on Cu(111)\nsurfaces using the X-ray standing wave (XSW) technique [15], ultra-violet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS)\nand density functional theory (DFT) based calculations.\nWhile XSW data are taken to determine exact the atomic\npositions along the surface normal and, thereby, also the\norientation of the molecules, the UPS measurements reveal how the adsorbate affects the electronic energy levels. In particular, our results demonstrate that the observed VL shift can be modeled very well if one accounts\nfor the adsorption geometry and the orientation of the\nmolecules.\nThe XSW experiments were carried out at beamline\nID32 of the European Synchrotron Radiation Source\n\nFIG. 1: Structure of the free GaClPc (Pc = C32 N8 H16 \u22122 )\nmolecule as obtained by geometry optimization using the\nGaussian03 program package. The results show that the Ga\n(red) and Cl atoms (orange) are located above the molecular\nplane with a Ga-Cl bond length of 2.21 \u00c5. The Pc group itself is non-planar with the two inequivalent N species (blue)\n0.50 \u00c5 and 0.58 \u00c5 below the Ga atom.\n\n\f2\n(ESRF) in Grenoble. Using the (111)-reflection of the\ncopper substrate we have taken data in back-reflection\ngeometry [2, 4], corresponding to the lattice plane spacing d = 2.08 \u00c5 with photon energies around EBragg =\n2.97 keV. The UPS experiments for different coverages were performed with a photoelectron spectrometer\nequipped with a standard He I light source (photon energy 21.2 eV) in our home laboratory. The Cu(111) crystal with a small mosaicity was prepared under ultra-high\nvacuum conditions by repeated cycles of argon sputtering and annealing (base pressure 4 \u00d7 10\u221210 mbar). The\nGaClPc material was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, purified by gradient sublimation, and thoroughly degassed.\nWith a quartz microbalance typical deposition rates of\n0.2 \u00c5/min were realized. For all experiments reported below the substrate temperature was carefully monitored.\nTo model the electronic structure of the molecules on\nthe Cu(111) surface, we employed slab-type DFT based\nband structure calculations using VASP [16]; more details\non the theoretical methods and the chosen geometry are\ngiven in the supplementary material [17].\nThe core-level spectra of GaClPc on Cu(111) show\nseveral signals that are suitable for XSW experiments\n(Fig. 2). By measuring photoemission spectra related to\nall atomic species in the molecule, namely C(1s), N(1s),\nGa(2p1/2 ), and Cl(2s)/Cl(KLL) Auger, we achieve a detailed electronic and structural characterization of the\nsystem.\n\nFIG. 2: Background corrected core-level spectra measured\nwith a hemispherical electron energy analyzer for a submonolayer of GaClPc on Cu(111). The intensity of the peaks\nrelative to the substrate signal has been used to determine\nthe surface coverage in monolayer equivalent units (ML).\n\nThe bonding distances and orientation of the molecule\nhave been derived from the characteristic variation of the\nphotoelectron yield Yp around the Bragg condition. The\nXSW data, which can be analyzed according to a wellestablished procedure using the experimental reflectivity\nR of the sample, yield two structural parameters: the\ncoherent position PH and coherent fraction fH , both of\nwhich can be determined by a least-square fitting routine [17]. While PH gives the average position of the\natoms relative to the diffraction planes, fH yields the\nspread of positions within the ensemble.\nFigure 3 shows XSW results for two different coverages, which were derived from series of core-level spectra.\n\nUnlike planar organic molecules [2, 4], the data corresponding to the different atoms exhibit pronounced differences. For sub-monolayer coverages (0.8 ML, Fig. 3a)\nour results indicate high orientational order within the\nmolecular ensemble on the surface. To convert the coherent positions given in Fig. 3a, i.e. PH (Ga) = 0.03, PH (C)\n= 0.14, PH (N) = 0.27, and PH (Cl)= 0.90, into the (average) bonding distances dH one must take into account\nthe modulo-d ambiguity of the XSW technique [15]. In\nprinciple, two different configurations can be considered\nfor low GaClPc coverages: Either a scenario 'Cl-up' with\ninteratomic distances which deviate strongly from the gas\nphase structure (e.g. a hypothetical Ga-Cl bond length of\nonly 1.83 \u00b1 0.07 \u00c5 compared to 2.21 \u00c5 in the gas phase),\nor a scenario 'Cl-down' with a corresponding Ga-Cl bond\nlength of 2.33 \u00b1 0.07 \u00c5 and a vertical N-Ga distance of\n0.50 \u00c5, i.e. values that are close to the interatomic distances in the gas phase. DFT calculations for the isolated molecule, which show that large molecular distortions of GaClPc are energetically very unfavorable, can\nbe used to rule out the 'Cl-up' case. The obvious conclusion that the molecules adsorb \u2013 similar to other Pc\nderivatives [10, 11] \u2013 predominantly in a 'Cl-down' configuration implies that the molecular dipoles contribute\nwith \u2206\u03a6dip < 0 to the overall VL shift. Having established the bonding distances for the low coverage (Fig. 3c)\nwith the corresponding error bars (Fig. 3d), we see that\nthe Cu-Cl layer spacing of 1.88 \u00c5 coincides with experimental results for chlorine adsorption on Cu(111) [18].\nThis agreement suggests a covalent bonding of the Cl\natoms to the substrate and, moreover, a hollow adsorption site as reported in Ref. [18].\nComplementing this picture, we find increasing magnitudes of fH for carbon (0.23), nitrogen (0.41), gallium\n(0.51), and chlorine (0.67), which indicate surprisingly\ndifferent spatial spreads. Therefore, we studied the influence of thermally activated librational motions of the\nGaClPc molecules in the 'Cl-down' configuration. Specific model calculations based on a statistical description\nof the ensemble (presented in the supplementary material [17]) were performed to refine the analysis. The\ntime-averaged spread of positions resulting from our simulations gives XSW parameters fH and PH , which \u2013 by\ncomparison with the experimental values \u2013 allow us to\ndetermine the libration amplitude. The analysis shows\nthat the atomic species within the GaClPc molecule are\naffected very differently and that even for small amplitudes there are strong changes of the coherent fractions\nfor C and N. The relative magnitude of the coherent fractions is consistent with a libration amplitude (rms) of\n17 \u00b1 3\u25e6 around the essentially fixed Cl-atom.\nFor higher GaClPc coverages (1.4 ML, Fig. 3b) the situation becomes more complex. The relatively small coverage dependence found for the Cl (and Ga) data contrasts with significant changes for the N (and C) signal.\nIn particular the very different values PH (N)=0.49 and\n\n\f3\n\nb)\n\nGaClPc/Cu(111)\n0.8 ML\n\n6\n\nEBragg = 2.97 keV\n\n5\n\nfH = 0.41\nPH = 0.27\n\nN(1s)\n\n4\n\nfH = 0.23\nPH = 0.14\n\nC(1s)\n\n3\n\nfH = 0.51\nPH = 0.03\n\nGa(2p1/2)\n\n2\n\nfH = 0.67\nPH = 0.90\n\nCl-Auger\n\n1\n\nIntensity (normalized)\n\nIntensity (normalized)\n\nEBragg = 2.97 keV\n\nc)\n\nGaClPc/Cu(111)\n1.4 ML\n\nBonding distance dH (\u00c5)\n\n6\n\n5\n\nfH = 0.13\nPH = 0.49\n\nN(1s)\n\n4\n\nfH = 0.00\nPH undefined\n\nC(1s)\n\n3\n\nfH = 0.25\nPH = 0.10\n\nGa(2p1/2)\n\n2\nCl(2s)\n\n1\nreflectivity\n\nreflectivity\n\n0\n\n0\n-1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\nE - EBragg (eV)\n\n-2\n\n-1\n\n0\n\n1\n\nE - EBragg (eV)\n\n2\n\n5\n4\n\nd = 4.71 (3) \u00c5\nd = 4.44 (7) \u00c5\nd = 4.21 (5) \u00c5\n\nGa\n\nd = 1.88 (3) \u00c5\n\nCl\n\nN\n\n+\nC\n\n3\n2\n\n-\n\n1\n0\n\nd)\n\nfH = 0.54\nPH = 0.92\n\n3\n\nCoherent position PH\n\na)\n\nGaClPc/Cu(111)\n0.3\n0.2\n0.1\n0.0\n0.9\n\n.............................................................................................\n.......... ................ .................................................................................................

The adsorption of GaClPc molecules with opposite orientation in the\nsecond layer \u2013 a phenomenon reported also for other Pc\nderivatives [6, 9] \u2013 could be confirmed also by metastable\natom electron spectroscopy (MAES) measurements [19].\nWithin our coverage series, we verified that a deposition of more than 4 ML results in atomically disordered\nsystems with incoherent XSW signals (fH = 0) for all\nelements.\nIn order to study how the orientational order of the\nmolecules affects the VL shift we measured the work\nfunction of the system for increasing GaClPc coverage\n(Fig. 4a). At first, the results obtained from the photoemission spectra reveal a rapid decrease below 0.2 ML\nas expected for the 'Cl-down' configuration. The continuous, yet slightly retarded VL shift results in a minimum of \u2206\u03a6 = \u22120.34 eV at the monolayer coverage. To\novercome possible kinetic limitations we deposited more\nmaterial (resulting in a gradual increase of \u03a6 for coverages of more than 1 ML due to preferential 'Cl-up' nucle-\n\nation) and applied a short annealing of the multilayer at\n300 \u25e6C. This procedure yields a coverage of slightly less\nthan 1 ML and a shift of \u2206\u03a6 = \u22120.60 eV. Because DFT\ncalculations, which we have performed using the adsorption geometry shown in Fig. 3c, predict a similar decrease\nof \u2206\u03a6 = \u22120.55 eV for a comparable coverage, we may\nrelate the electronic properties of annealed monolayer to\nthe low-coverage XSW data. Due to the orientational\norder we can separate the total change \u2206\u03a6 into two contributions with\n\u2206\u03a6 = \u2206\u03a6dip + \u2206\u03a6bond .\n\n(3)\n\nThus, we distinguish \u2206\u03a6dip , which is related to the\ndipole moment of the molecules according to Eq. (1),\nand \u2206\u03a6bond , which contains the effect of the moleculemetal interaction. To quantify the dipole contribution we have calculated a monolayer of GaClPc without metal substrate. Again using the adsorption geometry shown in Fig. 3c we obtain \u2206\u03a6dip = \u22120.30 eV.\nBecause of the large substrate-Pc distance and the correspondingly small Pauli repulsion the associated value\n\u2206\u03a6bond = \u22120.25 eV essentially reveals the effect of the\ncharge rearrangement within the Ga-Cl group and between the Cl and Cu atoms [17].\nThese conclusion are corroborated by the interpretation of the valence band spectra shown in Fig. 4b. The\ndata obtained for different coverages show that neither\nbefore nor after the annealing procedure prominent interface states \u2013 as they were reported for the adsorption\nof other planar [20] and non-planar [21] Pc molecules directly below the Fermi energy \u2013 can be observed.

(b) Valence band region measured by UPS for\ncoverages labeled correspondingly in the top panel. In these\nspectra peak A belongs to the Cu 3d band, A' is a satellite\nof A due to excitation by parasitic He I\u03b2 radiation, peak B is\nthe Shockley surface state of the clean Cu(111), and peak C\nis the HOMO-derived state of the multilayer film.\n\nabsence of characteristic spectral features in the HOMOLUMO gap [22] illustrates the weak interaction between\nthe substrate and the Pc ring in the 'Cl-down' orientation. We note that due to the photoemission selection\nrules and the orientation of the molecules no HOMOderived states can be seen in the normal emission spectra of both monolayer films shown Fig. 4b \u2013 in contrast to the disordered multilayer film, which exhibits\na pronounced HOMO-related peak centered at \u22121.42 eV.\nMoreover, the spectra illustrate the non-ideal growth of\nGaClPc at 80 \u25e6 C and the significant re-ordering caused\nby the annealing procedure. The strong quenching of\nthe Shockley surface state, which we find for the annealed\nfilm, clearly indicates a more uniform substrate coverage.\nIn summary, the XSW data together with the UPS\nmeasurements and the DFT calculations give a conclusive\npicture of the molecules' orientation and bonding. For\nsub-monolayer coverages at sufficiently high substrate\ntemperature the vast majority of GaClPc molecules adsorb in the 'Cl-down' configuration with a Cl-Cu layer\nspacing of 1.88 \u00c5 that indicates covalent bonding of the\nchlorine atoms. The interaction with the substrate gives\nrise to subtle deviations from the gas phase structure:\nIn agreement with the DFT calculations [17], the Ga-Cl\n\nbond length of 2.33 \u00c5 measured by XSW is slightly larger\nthan in the gas phase, while the average position of the\ncarbon atoms in the experiment and the calculations indicates a certain bending of the molecule [17]. Moreover,\nthe coherent fractions observed in the experiment can be\nrelated to thermal librations of the molecules. Due to\nthe orientational order the molecular dipoles contribute\nsignificantly to the vacuum level shift and the resulting interface dipole. Detailed calculations for the annealed monolayer support this conclusion quantitatively\nwith \u2206\u03a6dip = \u22120.30 eV. The influence of intermolecular\ninteractions is demonstrated by the coexistence of 'Cldown' and 'Cl-up' configurations found for deposition at\n80 \u25e6 C. Interestingly, a subsequent annealing allows a controlled re-ordering of the molecular dipoles and a change\nof the corresponding electronic properties. Furthermore,\nwe believe that the adsorption behavior of GaClPc and\nits impact on the electronic structure represent important characteristics of non-planar organic molecules.\nWe thank N.
