Naively, such theories should be ruled\nout by the catastrophic quantum instability of the vacuum. We derive phenomenological bounds on\nthe Lorentz-violating ultraviolet cutoff \u039b which must apply to low-energy effective theories of ghosts,\nin order to keep the instability at unobservable levels. Assuming only that ghosts interact at least\n< 3 MeV for consistency with the cosmic gamma ray background.\ngravitationally, we show that \u039b \u223c\nWe also show that theories of ghosts with a Lorentz-conserving cutoff are completely excluded.\nPACS numbers: 98.80.Cq, 98.70.Vc\n\nThe present accelerated expansion of the universe\nseems to be an experimental fact, now that data from\ndistant type Ia supernovae [1] have been corroborated\nby those from the cosmic microwave background [2]. Although the simplest explanation is a cosmological constant \u039b of order (10\u22123 eV)4 , this tiny energy scale is so\nfar below the expected \"natural\" size for a cosmological\nconstant, that alternative explanations have been vigorously pursued. A common approach has been to assume\nthat the true value of \u039b is zero, due to an unknown mechanism, and to propose new physics which would explain\nwhy the present-day vacuum energy differs from zero by\nthe small observed amount.\nThe most popular idea has been quintessence, in which\nthe universe is gradually approaching the zero of the vacuum energy by the slow rolling of an extremely weakly\ncoupled scalar field. More recently, some less conventional alternatives have been considered, including\n\"phantom matter,\" which is essentially quintessence with\na wrong-sign kinetic term [3]. These models are motivated by the supernova data, which suggest that the\ndark energy equation of state violates the weak energy\ncondition by having p < \u2212\u03c1 [4].\nA serious problem with phantom matter, which is overlooked in the literature that attempts to apply it to cosmology, is that such theories are not quantum mechanically viable, either because they violate conservation of\nprobability, or they have unboundedly negative energy\ndensity and lead to the absence of a stable vacuum state.\nWhether a ghost carries negative norm and positive energy, or vice versa, is a choice which is made during the\nquantization procedure. This choice exists because the\ni\u01eb prescription for defining the propagator near its poles\nis not unique, and not specified by the Lagrangian itself.\nThe momentum space propagator for a ghost can have\neither of the two forms\n\u2212i\np2 \u2212 m2 + i\u01eb\n\nor\n\n\u2212i\np2 \u2212 m2 \u2212 i\u01eb\n\n(1)\n\nIn the first form in (1), the imaginary part of the propagator has the opposite sign relative to that of a positive\nnorm particle. This will cause the optical theorem to\n\nbe violated, leading to a nonunitary theory. That is, this\nchoice gives a theory with no probabilistic interpretation.\nIt is therefore unphysical and should be dismissed.\nOn the other hand, if the second form in (1) is chosen,\nunitarity is maintained. The price to be paid is that the\npoles in the propagator are shifted in such a way that particles with negative energy are the ones which propagate\nforward in time, so ghosts possess negative energy. This\nmeans, for instance, that a two-body scattering process\ninvolving nonghosts and ghosts can result in an increase\nin the magnitude of the energies of the particles. To illustrate this, suppose that the ghost is massive so that\nwe can consider it to be initially at rest. If the initial\nenergy of a photon is Ei and it gravitationally scatters\nfrom the ghost at angle \u03b8, then its final energy is\nEf = Ei\n\n\u0012\n\nm\nm \u2212 Ei (1 \u2212 cos \u03b8)\n\n\u0013\n\n> Ei\n\n(2)\n\nin contrast to the nonghost case where photons can only\nlose energy in such scatterings. In fact, there exist initial\nenergies Ei = m/(1 \u2212 cos \u03b8) such that the final energy is\ndivergent. The final energy of the ghost is correspondingly large and negative.\nTo avoid this kind of problem, one should consider theories where the interactions between ghosts and normal\nmatter are as weak as possible. However, we must allow the ghosts to interact gravitationally, since it is their\ngravitational interactions which are needed for them to\nhave any cosmological consequences, and this is already\nenough. Gravitational interactions allow the process of\nfigure 1, in which a ghost pair and photon pair are spontaneously created from the vacuum. The phase space\nintegral is divergent, indicating a catastrophic instability. The divergent nature of the instability can only be\navoided if we impose a Lorentz noninvariant momentum\nspace cutoff on the final state phase space (more on this\nlater). Setting such a cutoff at the scale \u039b, the creation\nrate is, on dimensional grounds,\n\u03930\u21922\u03b32\u03c6 \u223c\n\n\u039b8\n.\nMp4\n\n(3)\n\n\f2\nWe have neglected Bose enhancement from final state\noccupancy, an assumption we will verify a posteriori.\nNotice that this pathology exists independently of the\nquestion of classical stability of the ghost-gravity system, which has been considered in [5]. The existence\nof this process is model independent-it requires only\nthe existence of a wrong sign, canonical kinetic term and\ngravitational interaction for the ghosts.\n\ng\n\n\u03c6\n\nwhere E0 = 451 MeV. Demanding that (6) not exceed\n(7) gives the upper limit\n\n\u03c6\n\n< 3 MeV .\n\u039b\u223c\n\n\u03b3\n\u03b3\n\nFigure 1. Graviton-mediated decay of vacuum\ninto two ghosts and two photons.\n\nAn implicit excuse for even considering phantom matter at the classical level is perhaps the idea that, at long\ndistances, the scalar field theory is merely an effective\none, whose ultraviolet completion is well defined and respects unitarity. In this way, it might be possible to have\na physical value for the cutoff in (3) which was small\nenough so that the rate of decay of the vacuum is slow\non cosmological time scales. In this letter, we estimate\njust how low a cutoff \u039b is required for consistency with\nobservational constraints. This question was previously\nconsidered in [6]; but we reach somewhat different conclusions, as we discuss below.\nTo find the density of photons which are spontaneously\nproduced, we evolve the phase space density of ghosts and\nphotons in an expanding universe,\nd 3 \u0001\na n = a3 \u0393 ,\ndt\n\n(4)\n\nwhere a(t) is the scale factor and \u0393 = \u03930\u21922\u03b32\u03c6 . The\nsolution is\n\u001a t\n,\na(t) \u223c tp\nn(t) = \u0393 3p+1\n.\n(5)\n\u22121\n\u22123Ht\nH (1 \u2212 e\n), a(t) \u223c eHt\nThat is, the current number density is approximately\ngiven by the production rate per spacetime volume, \u0393,\ntimes the age of the universe. Most of the photon pairs\nhave been produced since redshift z = 1, both because\nthere has been more time since z = 1 than before then,\nand because the density produced earlier was diluted by\nthe expansion of the universe. This also means that their\nenergy spectrum is not very different from the energy\nspectrum produced today; the spectrum peaks at E \u223c \u039b.\nTherefore we find,\ndn\n\u223c \u039b7 Mp\u22124 t0\ndE\n\nThis spectrum of photons with energy near \u039b is constrained by observations of the diffuse gamma ray background. EGRET [7] has measured the differential photon\nflux to be\n\u0012 \u0013\u22122.1\n\u0001\u22121\nE\ndF\n= 7.3 \u00d7 10\u22129\ncm2 s sr MeV\n, (7)\ndE\nE0\n\n< \u039b.\nfor E \u223c\n\n(6)\n\n(8)\n\nSince the observed gamma ray spectrum involves a mean\nparticle occupancy which is orders of magnitude less than\n1, neglect of Bose stimulation was entirely justified.\nWe emphasize that this bound depends only upon the\nghost having at least a minimal coupling to gravity. The\npossible presence of other couplings can only strengthen\nthe result. Nor does it depend on whether the ghost has a\npotential, so long as its mass is less than \u039b. In models of\nphantom cosmology, the mass is taken to be of order the\npresent Hubble scale, 10\u221233 eV, so this is not restrictive.\nThe process 0 \u2192 2\u03b32\u03c6 is not the only allowed one;\nwe can consider also the production of neutrinos and of\ne+ e\u2212 pairs. The neutrinos are hard to observe, so no\ngood constraint arises there. The e+ e\u2212 constraint may\nbe more fruitful, but the existence of galactic and Earth\nmagnetic fields makes it somewhat more difficult to relate\nan incident e+ flux to the extragalactic density. However,\na sufficiently dense intergalactic e+ e\u2212 plasma would lead\nto excessive rescattering of the cosmic microwave sky.\n< 40 MeV, still weaker\nThis leads to the constraint \u039b \u223c\nthan (8).\nLet us compare our bound (8) to those which were obtained in ref. [6]. There it was argued that one can constrain \u039b < 10\u22123 eV by considering the process \u03c6 \u2192 g \u03c6 \u03c6,\nwhere g is a graviton. This bound is incorrect, however. First of all, it arose by considering the \"decay\"\nrate of a ghost at rest, and insisting that this be longer\nthan the Hubble time to prevent the exponential runaway generation of ghosts. But the produced ghosts\ntypically carry energies \u223c \u039b, so their decay rates are\nstrongly time dilated. Demanding only that the time dilated decay rate be less than 1/t0 gives \u039b < 50 MeV.\nSecond, the constraint arose by considering an interaction Leff = \u03c6g \u03bc\u03bd \u2202\u03bc \u03c6\u2202\u03bd \u03c6. Not only is this interaction\nmodel dependent; it is actually an artifact of a noncanonical normalization of the \u03c6 field kinetic term, and can be\nremoved by a field redefinition. Therefore, the proposed\ndecay mechanism does not actually work. Diagrammatically, this is because the total amplitude is zero, as shown\nin figure 2. The naive contribution from the contact term\nis canceled by the three other diagrams, built from the\n\u03c6\u03b7 \u03bc\u03bd \u2202\u03bc \u03c6\u2202\u03bd \u03c6 vertex contained in the interaction, and the\ng \u03bc\u03bd \u2202\u03bc \u03c6\u2202\u03bd \u03c6 vertex from the standard kinetic term. Thus\nthe rate for \u03c6 \u2192 g\u03c6\u03c6 is zero. Ref. [6] then proceeds to\nobtain the bound \u039b < 100 MeV by requiring the decay\n\u03c6 \u2192 2g 3\u03c6 to be slower than the present Hubble rate. But\n\n\f3\nthis bound is model dependent; it requires higher derivative Lagrangian terms. It also suffers from the same error\nof using at-rest decay rates, so the quoted bound is orders\nof magnitude too stringent.\n\ng\n\u03c6\n\n\u03c6\n\n\u0393\u223c\n\n+\n\n\u03c6\n=0\n+\n\nin addition the Lorentz invariant bound s < \u039b2 on the\ngraviton propagator, the production rate becomes finite.\nDenoting the 4-momentum of the virtual graviton as k,\nthe production rate is\n\n+\n\nFigure 2. Vanishing of the amplitude for a ghost\nto decay into graviton and two ghosts.\n\nRemarks. The stringent limit we have obtained from\n< 3 MeV, implies\nthe diffuse gamma ray background, \u039b \u223c\nthat any theory of low-energy effective ghosts must originate from new physics far below the TeV scale. Therefore we cannot invoke string theory, for example, as a\nplausible source for effective ghosts. Instead, we must\nimagine that they come from a low-energy sector that\nis completely hidden from the standard model, except\nfor gravitational couplings. This makes ghosts look even\nmore unlikely, in our view.\nAnother troubling feature is that, in order to pose this\nproblem at all, we were forced to assume that Lorentz\nsymmetry is broken. By taking the phase space for production of two photons plus two ghosts to be cut off\nat some momentum \u039b, we have singled out a preferred\nframe, namely the rest frame of the cosmic microwave\nbackground radiation. Obviously there exist other frames\nwhere k > \u039b even if k < \u039b in the CMB rest frame. Such\na cutoff might arise if, for example,\nthe ghost dispersion\np\nrelation had the form \u03c9 = \u2212 k 2 \u2212 k 4 /\u039b2 , which would\nresult from the Lorentz-violating Lagrangian \u2212 21 (\u2202\u03c6)2 +\n1 \u22122 ~ 2 2\n(\u2207 \u03c6) . The Lorentz-violating cutoff is necessary\n2\u039b\nbecause, if we try to impose a Lorentz invariant cutoff,\nfor instance on the virtuality of the off-shell graviton,\nthen there is still a divergent integral over the boost,\nwith respect to the microwave background frame, of the\nrest frame of the (timelike) graviton.\nIf we demand Lorentz invariance, but want to be maximally conservative, then we could argue that a process\nwith a formation time longer than the age of the universe should not be considered. This places a bound\non the boost\nbetween graviton and microwave frames,\n\u221a\nof \u03b3 < t0 s, where s is the Mandelstam variable (the 4momentum squared of the off-shell graviton). Imposing\n\nZ\n\nd4 k \u03b8(\u039b2 \u2212 k 2 ) \u03b8(t0 \u2212 k0 /k 2 )\n\n\u039b10 t20\nk4\n\u223c\n, (9)\n4\nMp\nMp4\n\nso that the number density is \u223c \u039b10 t30 Mp\u22124 . The typical\nenergy of a produced photon is k0 \u223c \u039b2 t0 ; even for a cutoff \u039b of order milli-electron volts, the energy is \u223c 1018\nGeV. The dominant mechanism by which gamma rays\nof such an energy scatter on the way to the Earth is\n\u03b3\u03b3 \u2192 4e, with the second \u03b3 a microwave background\nphoton; the free path is about 120 megaparsecs [8], leading to about a twenty-fold reduction in the flux. Arriving at the Earth, such a gamma ray would produce an\nair shower more energetic than any that have ever been\nseen. Using current bounds on the flux of such cosmic\nrays, less than 1 event per km2 per century [9], leads to\n< 1 meV (milli-electron volt). Grava constraint of \u039b \u223c\nity would receive order 1 modifications at a length scale\n> 0.2 millimeters, in contradiction with experiment [10].\nHence, we conclude that even under very conservative assumptions, ghosts within a Lorentz invariant framework\nare experimentally excluded.\nThe requirement of Lorentz violation is worrisome, because it is inconsistent with general covariance. General covariance is the framework for general relativity,\nand it provides the gauge principle which guarantees the\nmasslessness of the graviton. There are also very severe\nconstraints on Lorentz violation within ordinary particle physics [11]; and Lorentz violation in another sector\ntends to be communicated to ordinary particle physics\nvia graviton loops [12]. It is also troubling that, to our\nknowledge, no consistent construction of a low energy\ntheory with ghosts from a ghost-free fundamental theory\nexists.\nThese considerations incline us toward the view that\nghosts should not be feared, not because they are harmless, but because it is very unlikely that they exist. The\ninconveniences of a small cosmological constant seem\nmuch more bearable than those brought on by ghosts.\nWe thank Nima Arkani-Hamed, Ramy Brustein,\nDaniel Chung, Anne M.
