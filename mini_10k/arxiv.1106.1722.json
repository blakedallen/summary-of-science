The transport of heat depends on the interplay between the\nthermal, viscous and integral scales of turbulence, and thus, on both the Prandtl number and the\nReynolds numbers. Depending on their values, a wide variety of possible regimes is found, including\nthe classical 2/7 and 1/3 law, and a new 4/13 = 0.308 law for the Nusselt power law variation with\nthe Rayleigh number.\nPACS numbers: 47.27 -i Turbulent flows, convection and heat transfer - 47.27.Eq Turbulence simulation and\nmodeling - 47.27.Te Convection and heat transfer\n\nUntil the advent of high precision numerical and experimental data, the heat transport in turbulent convection\nwas thought to be governed by the classical 1/3 power\nlaw linking the Nusselt number and the Rayleigh number.\nDeviations from this prediction have now been measured\nat large Rayleigh numbers, revealing a whole zoology of\nscaling exponents. They range from 0.2 to 0.25 in low\nPrandtl number, Mercury experiments [1], to 0.29 \u00b1 0.1\nin Helium experiments [2\u20134], while electro-chemical convection gives the classical 1/3 exponent [5]. A number of\ntheoretical models based on dimensional arguments have\nbeen developed to explain these new regimes [1, 2, 6], including the possibility that no real scaling prevails [7]. In\nthis letter, predictions obtained using a solvable model of\nturbulent convection are presented. This model couples\nlarge scale mean sheared velocity and temperature fields\nU = (U (z), 0, 0) and \u0398(z), with small scale random velocity and temperature fields. This kind of large scale\ngeometry is generally accepted as representative of the\nBoussinesq convection in the boundary layers, due to the\nshearing effect of the large convective cells. The model\nis closed by deriving an equation for the random component from the Boussinesq equation using two simplifying\nassumptions: i) the non-linear interactions of the small\nscale scales between themselves is modeled via a turbulent viscosity; ii) the small scale generation via the breaking of large scale structures is modeled by a random small\nscale forcing with prescribed statistics. This results in a\nlinear stochastic equation for the random small scales,\nwhich can be analytically solved in the shear flow geometry by a decomposition of the small waves into localized\nwave-packets. This model was used to obtain analytical\npredictions of mean velocity and/or temperature profiles\nin neutral boundary layer or channel flows [8] or in the\nPlanetary Surface Layer (PSL) [9]. Here, we adapt and\ngeneralize these results to determine both the structure\nof the boundary layers, and various scaling laws relating\nthe Nusselt number N u and various length scales to the\nRayleigh number Ra. Some of our findings are then compared with results from high resolution direct numerical\nsimulations (DNS) at Ra between 104 and 108 , and at\n\nP r between 0.02 and 7, which are described in [10\u201312].\nWe consider Boussinesq equations, nondimensionalized\nby the thermal diffusivity and the cell height:\n(u)\n\n\u2202t ui + \u2202j (ui uj ) = \u2212\u2202i p + RaP r\u03b8\u03b4i3 + P r\u2206ui + fi ,\n\u2202t \u03b8 + \u2202j (uj \u03b8) = \u2206\u03b8 + f (\u03b8) .\n\n(1)\n\nHere, P r is the Prandtl number, and f (u) and f (\u03b8) are\nsmall scale random forces which are introduced to model\nthe seeding of small scales by turbulent plumes detaching from the wall and penetrating the outer region. For\nsimplicity, this forcing is taken as spatially homogeneous\nand delta correlated in time [13]. These assumptions\nonly influence the magnitude of the Reynolds stresses,\nnot their shape [8] . Averaging (1) over the statistics\nof the forcing and assuming a shear flow geometry, one\nobtains the standard equations for the x-component of\nU =< u >= (U (z), 0, 0) and for \u0398(z) =< \u03b8 >:\n\u2202t U + \u2202z < u\u2032 w\u2032 > = \u2212\u2202x P + P r\u2202z2 U,\n\u2202t \u0398 + \u2202z < w\u2032 \u03b8\u2032 > = \u2202z2 \u0398.\n\n(2)\n\nHere, the primes denote fluctuating (small scale) quantities and <> the averaging. In the stationary case, we\nget from (2) that \u2202x P is a constant, independent of z. In\nthe laminar case where < u\u2032 w\u2032 > and < w\u2032 \u03b8\u2032 > are negligible, we thus obtain the well known parabolic profile\nfor the velocity and the linear profile for the temperature. In the turbulent case, the profiles are linear within\nthe thermal or the viscous layer, while outside this layer,\nthey are given by the condition\n\u2202z < u\u2032 w\u2032 >= \u2212\u2202x P,\n\n\u2202z < w\u2032 \u03b8\u2032 >= 0.\n\n(3)\n\nTo close the system, we need < u\u2032 w\u2032 > and < w\u2032 \u03b8\u2032 >.\nFor this, we now derive an equation for the fluctuating\nquantities, by taking into account the scale separation\nbetween the mean field and the random field l/L = \u03b7 \u226a\n1. For this, we decompose the velocity field into localized\nwave-packets via a Gabor transform (GT):\nZ\n\u2032\n\u00fb(x, k, t) = g(\u03b7 \u2217 |x \u2212 x\u2032 |)eik*(x\u2212x ) u(x\u2032 , t)dx\u2032 , (4)\n\n\f2\nwhere g is a function which decreases rapidly at infinity\nand 1 \u226b \u03b7 \u2217 \u226b \u03b7. Because of this, the GT of any large\nscale field is exponentially small in \u03b7 \u2217 , and the GT of\nUj \u2202j u\u2032 i can be developed into Uj \u2202j \u00fb\u2032 i \u2212 \u2202j (Um km )\u2202kj \u00fb\u2032 i\n(see [8] for details). Using these properties, we obtain\nafter GT of (1) the small scale equation:\n(u)\n\nDt \u00fbi = \u2212iki p\u0302 \u2212 \u0175\u2202z U \u03b4i1 + RaP r\u03b8\u0302\u03b4i3 \u2212 P rt k2 \u00fbi + f\u02c6i\n(5)\nDt \u03b8\u0302 = \u2212\u0175\u2202z \u0398 \u2212 k2 \u03b8\u0302 + f\u02c6(\u03b8) .\nWe have dropped primes on fluctuating quantities for\nconvenient notations and introduced the total derivative\nDt = \u2202t + U \u2202x \u2212 \u2202z (U kx )\u2202kz . In (5), we have furthermore model the GT of the non-linear terms describing\nlocal interactions between fluctuations via the introduction of turbulent viscosity and diffusivity, or equivalently,\nvia a turbulent Prandtl number P rt . The linear part of\n(5) is exact and describes the non-local interactions between the mean and the fluctuating part. We have thus\nobtained a linear, stochastic equation for the fluctuating\nquantities to close our system.\nTo solve the closed system (2) and (5), we introduce\ntwo further simplification: i) we restrict ourselves to the\n2D case. This is justified because numerical work on 2D\nthermal convection showed that 2D geometry is sufficient\nto capture the physical mechanism responsible for the N u\nscaling with Ra [12]. Analytical work on neutral shear\nflow has also proved that 2D geometry is sufficient to capture the correct shape of the equilibrium profile [8]. Note\nthat the vortex stretching, which is theoretically absent\nin 2D geometry, has been implicitly accounted for via the\nturbulent viscosity. In real 2D flows, this turbulent viscosity can be ignored [8]. ii) we take P rt = 1. This is\nbecause our model introduces a turbulent Prandtl number whose exact value is unknown, which implies that the\ncorrect P r scaling cannot be captured within our model.\nGeneral P r effects will be introduced in another manner,\nvia links between length scales. With these approximations, it was shown in [9] that to leading order in the\nReynolds number Re, the solutions of (5) satisfy:\n\u0013\u2212(2+4a+ )/3\n\u0012\n1\n\u2202z U\n\u2032 \u2032\n<wu > =\n2\u2202z U (a+ \u2212 a\u2212 )2\nk\u22172\n\u00132 !\n\u0012\nRaP\nr\nRaP\nr\n\u03bb3 ,\n\u03bb2 +\n4a2\u2212 \u03bb1 +\n\u2202z U\n\u2202z U\n\u0013\u2212(2+4a+ )/3\n\u0012\n1\n\u2202z U\n< w\u2032 \u03b8\u2032 > =\n2\u2202z U (a+ \u2212 a\u2212 )2\nk\u22172\n\nis the Richardson number. In developed convective turbulence, this number is large and negative Ri \u226a \u22121. So\nonly the leading order contribution in Ri in the expression (6) will be further considered. Combining (3) with\nthe large Ri expansion of (6), we find that the turbulent\nprofiles are given by the conditions:\nu2\u2217\n\u221d z,\n\u2202z U\n\u221a\nu2 \u2212Ri\n< w\u2032 \u03b8\u2032 > \u2248 \u2217\n\u221d cte = N u,\nRaP r\n\n< w \u2032 u\u2032 > \u2248\n\n(8)\n\n\u221a\n\nwhere we have introduced u2\u2217 = (\u2202z U/k\u22172 )2 \u2212Ri /3 . Looking for simple solutions where \u2202z U and \u2202z \u0398 are power\nlaws of z, the only solution is:\n\u2202z U \u223c\n\n1\n,\nz\n\n\u2202z \u0398 \u223c\n\n1\n,\nz2\n\n(9)\n\nresulting in a constant (with z) Richardson number. This\nsolution corresponds to the standard logarithmic velocity profile, and a temperature profile decreasing like 1/z.\nSuch a profile had been predicted by Malkus [14] using\na maximum principle. It was found to be in good agreement with experiments of large Ra convection [15] and\nDNS at Ra = 108 and P r = 0.7 [11, 16]. For the velocity\nprofile, the prediction (9) is difficult to check numerically,\nbecause the Reynolds number is too low for the boundary\nlayer to be fully developed [16]. Even in the large Raleigh\nnumber experiments of [17], the extent of the turbulent\nboundary layer is too small (a tenth of the cell) to check\nthis prediction. However, in the PSL, the prediction (9)\nappears compatible with the measurements [9].\nIt is also possible to find the leading order behavior in\nRe and Ri of vertical velocities and temperature fluctuations, using the results of [9]. They are:\n< w\u20322 >\u2248 Ri\n\nu2\u2217\n,\n\u2202z U\n\n< \u03b8\u20322 >\u2248 Ri\n\nu2\u2217 \u2202z U\n.\n(RaP r)2\n\n(10)\n\nThis give a r.m.s. vertical velocity and temperature varying like z 1/2 and z \u22121/2 , like in the free-fall regime. For the\ntemperature fluctuation, the predicted decrease is more\nrapid than the classical z \u22121/3 prediction. This feature\nhas been already observed in high Ra convection [17]. In\nthe PSL, the r.m.s. velocity and temperature are compatible with (10) [9].\nFrom (8) and (9), we may also derive interesting exact\nrelations.\nBy matching the turbulent profiles with the\n!\nviscous\nor\ndiffusive solutions P r\u2202z U = u2\u03c4 and \u2202z \u0398 =\nRaP r\n2 \u2202z U\n\u2212 8a+ a\u2212\n\u03bc1 + 4a+ a\u2212 \u03bc2 \u2212 2a+\n\u03bcN\nu,. where u\u03c4 is the friction velocity and N u the Nusselt\n3(6)\nRaP r\n\u2202z U\nnumber, we get:\nHere, k\u2217 is a characteristic horizontal wavenumber, \u03bbi\n\u0012 \u00132\n\u03bbV\n\u03bbT\nand \u03bci (i = 1, ..3) are some constant which depend\n\u2202z U = u2\u03c4\n,\n(11)\n, \u2202z \u0398 = N u\nzP\nr\nz\non\nthe\nforcing\ncorrelation\nfunctions,\nand\na\n=\n\u2212(1\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\u221a\n1 \u2212 4Ri )/2, where\nHere, we have introduced the thermal length scale \u03bbT =\n\u2202z \u0398\n1/N\nu and the viscous length scale \u03bbV = P r/u\u03c4 . To find\n,\n(7)\nRi = RaP r\nthe prefactor in (8), we use the law of energy dissipation\n(\u2202z U )2\n\n\f3\nin a boundary layer geometry which gives \u01eb \u223c< u\u2032 w\u2032 >\n\u2202z U . We then take into account the exact relation \u01eb =\nRaN u and use (8), to obtain u2\u2217 = RaN u and:\nRa\n< u\u2032 w \u2032 >\nRaP r\n\u221a\n=\n=\n.\n< w\u2032 \u03b8\u2032 >\n\u2202\n\u2202z U \u2212Ri\nzU\n\n(12)\n\nThe first equality comes from (8), while the second comes\nfrom the link between \u01eb and < u\u2032 w >. Condition (12)\nshows that Ri is independent of Ra. This condition is\nactually a necessary condition for stability of the turbulent boundary layer [2]. The definition (7) combined with\n(11) then implies:\nRa = u2\u03c4 N uP r.\n\n(13)\n\nWe may also use (11) and the above estimate\nto define\np\na characteristic vertical velocity\u221awc = < w\u20322 > /z and\ntemperature fluctuation \u2206c = < \u03b8\u20322 > z, which scale\nas:\nr\nr\nRaN u\nu\u03c4 N u\n, \u2206c \u223c\n.\n(14)\nwc \u223c\nu\u03c4\nRa\nThese exact relations derived within our nonlocal model\nwill be the basis of the scaling theory which we now detail.\nFor this, we follow [11] and introduce a third length\nscale, noted \u03bbI , representing the location of the peak\nof the kinetic horizontal energy spectrum. Its expression can again be found within the nonlocal framework\nby noting that this length scale coincides with the location of the maximum of the r.m.s. horizontal velocity.\nIn the non-local model, this horizontal velocity is passively advected by the large scale horizontal velocity and\nobeys U \u2202x u\u2032 = \u2202z2 u\u2032 . The solution to this equation depends on the structure of the velocity boundary layer: if\nthe Reynolds number is too small, the boundary layer is\nmainly laminar, U = u\u03c4 z/\u03bbV and simple dimensional ar1/3\ngument show that u\u2032 is a function of z/(x\u03bbV u\u22121\n. For\n\u03c4 )\na fixed aspect ratio \u0393, this defines a typical vertical scale\n1/3\nof r.m.s. velocity variation \u03bbI = (\u0393\u03bbV u\u22121\n. When the\n\u03c4 )\nReynolds number exceeds a critical value of the order of\nRec \u223c 105 [18], the boundary layer turbulence is well developed, and most of the transport of u\u2032 is provided by\nthe turbulent logarithmic regime U \u223c u\u03c4 (lnz + B). This\nregime is hard to obtain at Prandtl numbers of the order\none or larger and it is likely that only low Prandtl number system (like Mercury experiments) have the ability\nto reach this critical Reynolds number [1]. In this regime,\n1/2\nu\u2032 is a function of z/(xu\u22121\n, thereby defining a typical\n\u03c4 )\n\u22121 1/2\nlength scale \u03bbI \u223c (\u0393u\u03c4 )\n[19]. The two regimes can\nbe lumped into the single formula \u03bbI \u223c \u03bbV (\u0393u\u03c4 P r\u22122 )\u03c8 ,\nwhere \u03c8 = 1/3 for Re < Rec and \u03c8 = 1/2 for Re > Rec .\nUsing these results, the logic of our argumentation is now\nto link u\u03c4 to N u by relating \u03bbV and/or \u03bbI to \u03bbT , and\nthen use the exact relation (13) to obtain N u versus Ra.\n1\u2212\u03b1\nFor this, we set \u03bbT = \u03bb\u03b1\n, where 0 \u2264 \u03b1 \u2264 1 is a\nV \u03bbI\nparameter which enables to single out three remarkable\n\nregimes. In the first one, \u03b1 = 1, \u03bbT = \u03bbV : the viscous\nand thermal layer coincide. This situation might be typical of large aspect ratio cells, or in numerical simulations\nwith stress-free boundary conditions [20]. In our model,\nit corresponds to N u \u223c Ra1/3 P r\u22121 , the classical case.\nIn the second regime, 0 < \u03b1 < 1 and the length-scale\nordering changes to \u03bbV < \u03bbT < \u03bbI . This situation seems\nto be typical for convection at P r \u223c 1 [11]. For illustration purpose, it is interesting to single out two special\nvalue of \u03b1 which are relevant in turbulence: the first one\nis \u03b1 = 2/3. This corresponds to \u03bbT being the Taylor\nmicro-scale, given by the square root of the mean energy\nto the mean enstrophy. The second value is \u03b1 = 2/5. The\ncorresponding scale varies like \u03bbI (\u03bbI Re)\u22123/10 , where Re\nis the Reynolds number based on the cell size and on the\nvelocity at the integral scale UI . It was shown [21] to\ncorrespond to the maximum of the Kolmogorov function\nand represents the location of the middle of the inertial\nrange. At last, the third regime is obtained with \u03b1 = 0,\nmaking \u03bbT = \u03bbI . This situation is typical of low Prandtl\nnumber convection. In our estimate of \u03b1, we have followed standard turbulence phenomenology, and assumed\nthat \u03bbI = \u03bbV (\u03bbI Re)3/4 . Note that for the heat transport, the exact relation in the two regimes (\u03c8 = 1/3 or\n1/2) is:\n1\u2212\u03c8[1\u2212\u03b1]\n\n2\u03c8[1\u2212\u03b1]\n\nN u \u223c Ra 3\u2212\u03c8[1\u2212\u03b1] \u0393\u2212 3\u2212\u03c8[1\u2212\u03b1] P r\n\n5\u03c8[1\u2212\u03b1]\u22123\n3\u2212\u03c8[1\u2212\u03b1]\n\n.\n\n(15)\n\nThe Prandtl dependence obtained in our model is\nstronger than in standard models of turbulent convection. It is not necessarily inconsistent with available data.\nSuch a dependence would for example account for most\nof the difference between the P r = 4 experiment of [26]\nand the P r = 0.8 experiment of [22]. However, we do not\nexpect our model to fully capture the general Prandtl dependence, because of our approximation on the turbulent\nPrandtl number. In the sequel, we thus concentrate on\nthe Rayleigh dependence of the physical quantities. The\nvarious scaling exponents predicted by the combination\nof (13) , (14) and the length scale relation is summarized\nin Table I. For purpose of comparison with the DNS, we\nhave also included the predictions for Re < Rec at three\nspecial values of \u03b1, relevant to the low and order unity\nPrandtl number.\nIn the low Prandtl regime, our model predicts a transition between a N u = Ra1/4 regime up to N u = Ra1/5\nregime at larger Re or Ra. This is in agreement with the\nexperimental findings of [1]. In the regime of P r \u223c 1,\nthe prediction depends on the value of \u03b1. At Re < Rec ,\nwe find \u03b2 = 4/13 (\u03b1 = 2/3) and \u03b2 = 2/7 (\u03b1 = 2/5).\nThe two values are close to the 0.29 value usually observed in experiments or in simulations. The 2/7 value\nis here exactly recovered when the thermal length scale\nmatches the middle of the inertial range, which may help\ngive a novel interpretation of the 2/7 law. The value\n\u03b2 = 4/13 = 0.3077 is in remarkable agreement with the\nexperimental value \u03b2 = 0.309 \u00b1 0.0043 obtained in [4] using an Helium experiment with 0.5 aspect ratio and spanning eleven decades of Rayleigh number.

For wc and \u2206c scaling with Ra, very good\nagreement between the prediction and the experimental\nvalue 0.43 and \u22120.2 [1] is obtained at low Prandtl number. For P r \u223c 1, our estimates of wc L/\u03bd coincides for\n\u03b1 = 2/3 with the value 0.485 \u00b1 0.005 measured in Helium\n[2], while the exponent for \u2206c is slightly larger than the\nexperimental value \u22120.147.\nAnother test of our predictions can also be made by\ncomparison with DNS, where some length scales have\nbeen measured. The results are shown in Table II. They\nare in rather good agreement with the theoretical result,\nexcept for the case P r = 7 of [11] where both the nondimensional vertical velocity and the integral scale exponent deviate substantially from the prediction. It would\ncertainly be interesting to investigate further the meaning of this discrepancy. For instance, it might be due to\na Rayleigh dependence of the turbulent Prandtl number.\nFinally, we note that the aspect ratio is also likely to\nmodify the recirculation pattern within a given cell and\nchange the relative behavior between the length scales,\nName Verzicco and Camussi Werne (2D) Kerr and Herring\nP r = 0.02 P r = 0.7\nPr = 7\nP r = 0.07 P r = 7\nLwc /\u03bd\n0.54\n0.47\n0.56\n0.39\nu\u03c4\n\u03bbT\n\u22120.25\n\u22120.29\n\u22120.26\n\u22120.29\n\u03bbI\n\u22120.18\n\u22120.23\n\u22120.26\n\u22120.11\n\nRe > Rec gives slightly different values.

The first value is so close to the value obtained before the transition, that it would make any transition difficult to detect experimentally. This may explain\nwhy no transition was detected in [4], despite the large\nRayleigh values attained. The second value is sufficiently\nlower than the value before transition, so that it should\nbe detectable in a careful experiment. Finally, in the\nthird regime, we find \u03b2 = 1/3 at all Reynolds number,\nin agreement with the P r = 1 DNS of [12]. Our model\nseems to rule out the \u03b2 = 1/2 which has been predicted\nby Kraichnan [24] at very large Rayleigh number, and\nwhich might have been experimentally detected by Chavanne et al [25]. If this regime is confirmed, it might then\ncorrespond to a situation where the boundary layer grows\nunstable, thereby unvalidating a starting assumption of\n\nTABLE II: Summary of exponents as a function of the\nRayleigh number as measured in various DNS at aspect ratio\n1 for the three first cases, and 4 for the last two.\n\n[1] S.
