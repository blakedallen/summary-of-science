Specifically, analysis was performed over high statistics deep\ninelastic scattering data provided by BCDMS, SLAC, NMC and BFP\ncollaborations. For the coupling constant the following value \u03b1s (MZ2 ) =\n0.1167 \u00b1 0.0022 was found.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nIt goes without saying how it is crucial to know as accurate as possible\nthe parton distribution functions (PDFs) and the value of the strong\ncoupling constant in order to be able to make (relatively) solid predictions for various processes studied in a number of experiments. Within\nthis realm, the deep inelastic scattering (DIS) of leptons off hadrons\nserves to be a cornerstone process to study PDFs which are universal\nand feed them further to other processes.\nNowadays the accuracy of data for DIS structure functions (SFs)\nmakes it possible to study Q2 -dependence of logarithmic QCD-inspired\ncorrections and those of power-like (non-perturbative) nature in a separate way (see for instance [2] and references therein) which is important\nfor the analysis to be performed according to a well defined scheme.\n\n1\n\n\fUntil recently a commonly adopted benchmark tool for the analysis\nhappened to be there at the next-to-leading-order (NLO) level. However\nthere have already appeared papers in which QCD analysis of DIS SFs\nhas been carried out up to the next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO)\n(see [1] and [3]\u2013[10] and references therein).\nIn the present paper we show the results of our recent analysis [1] of\nof DIS SF F2 (x, Q2 ) with SLAC, NMC, BCDMS and BFP experimental\ndata involved [11]\u2013[14] at NNLO of massless perturbative QCD.\nAs in our previous paper the function F2 (x, Q2 ) is represented as a\nsum of the leading twist F2pQCD (x, Q2 ) and the twist four terms:\n2\n\nF2 (x, Q ) =\n\nF2pQCD (x, Q2 )\n\nh\u03034 (x)\n1+\nQ2\n\n!\n\n.\n\n(1)\n\nAs is known there are at least two ways to perform QCD analysis over\nDIS data: the first one (see e.g. [15, 16]) deals with Dokshitzer-GribovLipatov-Altarelli-Parisi (DGLAP) integro-differential equations [17] and\nlet the data be examined directly, whereas the second one involves the\nSF moments and permits performing an analysis in analytic form as\nopposed to the former option. In this work we take on the way inbetween these two latter, i.e. analysis is carried out over the moments\nof SF F2k (x, Q2 ) defined as follows\nMnpQCD/twist2/...(Q2 )\n\n=\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n1\n\npQCD/twist2/...\n\nxn\u22122 F2\n\n(x, Q2 ) dx\n\n(2)\n\nand then reconstruct SF for each Q2 by using Jacobi polynomial expansion method [18]-[20] (for further details see [21]). The theoretical input\ncan be found in the papers [21, 22].\n\n2\n\nA fitting procedure\n\nTo cut short this follows along the lines described in the paper [21].\nHere we just recall some aspects of the so-called polynomial expansion\nmethod. The latter was first proposed in [23] and further developed\nin [24]. In these papers the method was based on the Bernstein polynomials and subsequently used to analyze data at NLO [25, 26] and NNLO\nlevel [7, 6]. The Jacobi polynomials for that purpose were first proposed\nand then subsequently developed in [18, 19, 20] and used in [3]-[6], [27].\nWith the QCD expressions for the Mellin moments Mnk (Q2 ) analytically calculated according to the formulae given above the SF F2k (x, Q2 )\n\n2\n\n\fis reconstructed by using the Jacobi polynomial expansion method:\nF2k (x, Q2 )\n\na\n\nb\n\n= x (1 \u2212 x)\n\nNX\nmax\n\n\u0398a,b\nn (x)\n\nn=0\n\nn\nX\n\n(n)\n\nk\ncj (\u03b1, \u03b2)Mj+2\n(Q2 ) ,\n\nj=0\n\nwhere \u0398a,b\nn are the Jacobi polynomials and a, b are the parameters fitted.\nA condition put on the latter is the requirement of the error minimization while reconstructing the structure functions.\nSince a twist expansion starts to be applicable only above Q2 \u223c 1\nGeV2 the cut Q2 \u2265 1 GeV2 on data is applied throughout.\nMINUIT program [28] is used to minimize two variables\n\u03c72SF =\n\nF2exp \u2212 F2teor\n\u2206F2exp\n\n2\n\n\u03c72slope =\n\n,\n\nD exp \u2212 D teor\n\u2206D exp\n\n2\n\n,\n\nwhere D = d ln F2 /d ln ln Q2 . Quality of the fits is characterized by\n\u03c72 /DOF for the SF F2 . Analysis is also performed for the SF slope D\nthat serves the purpose of checking the properties of fits.\nWe use free normalizations of the data for different experiments. For\na reference set, the most stable deuterium BCDMS data at the value of\nthe beam initial energy E0 = 200 GeV is used.\n\n3\n\nResults\n\nIn the nonsinglet approximation gluons are not taken into account,\nhence the cut on Bjorken variable (x \u2265 0.25) imposed where the gluon\ndensity is believed to be negligible.\nThe starting point of the evolution is taken to be Q20 = 90 GeV2 .\nThis latter value is close to the average value of Q2 spanning the corresponding data. On grounds of previous knowledge the maximal value\nof the number of moments to be accounted for is Nmax = 8 [19, 20]\n(though we check Nmax dependence just like in the NLO analysis) and\nthe cut 0.25 \u2264 x \u2264 0.8 is imposed everywhere.\nAnalogously to what has been done in [21, 1] the cut on the Bjorken\nvariable x is imposed in combination with those placed on the y variable\nas follows:\ny \u2265 0.14\n\nfor\n\n0.3 < x \u2264 0.4\n\ny \u2265 0.16\n\nfor\n\n0.4 < x \u2264 0.5\n\ny \u2265 0.23\n\nfor\n\n0.5 < x \u2264 0.6\n\ny \u2265 0.24\n\nfor\n\n0.6 < x \u2264 0.7\n\ny \u2265 0.25\n\nfor\n\n0.7 < x \u2264 0.8 ,\n\n3\n\n\fwhich are meant to cut out those points suffering large systematic errors.\nThen a full set of data to be analyzed consists of 797 points.\nTo verify a range of applicability of perturbative QCD we start with\nanalyzing the data without a contribution coming from the twist-four\nterms (which means F2 = F2pQCD ) and perform several fits with the cut\nQ2 \u2265 Q2min gradually increased. From Table 1 it is seen that unlike\nthe NLO analysis quality of the fits starts to appear fairly good from\nQ2 = 7 GeV2 onwards. For the purpose of comparison, the twist-four\ncorrections are added and the data with a general cut Q2 \u2265 1 GeV2\nimposed upon is fitted. It is clearly seen that as in the NLO case\nhere the higher twists do sizably improve the quality of the fit, with\ninsignificant discrepancy in the values of the coupling constant to be\nquoted below.\nTable 1. \u03b1s (MZ2 ) and \u03c72 in the case of the combined analysis\n\nQ2min\n1.0\n2.0\n3.0\n4.0\n5.0\n6.0\n7.0\n8.0\n9.0\n10.0\n11.0\n12.0\n13.0\n14.0\n15.0\n1.0\n\nN of\npoints\n797\n772\n745\n723\n703\n677\n650\n632\n613\n602\n588\n574\n570\n562\n550\n797\n\nHTC\n\n\u03c72 (F2 )/DOF\n\nNo\nNo\nNo\nNo\nNo\nNo\nNo\nNo\nNo\nNo\nNo\nNo\nNo\nNo\nNo\nYes\n\n2.20\n1.14\n0.97\n0.92\n0.92\n0.92\n0.92\n0.93\n0.93\n0.92\n0.91\n0.92\n0.92\n0.92\n0.91\n0.98\n\n\u03b1s (90 GeV2 ) \u00b1 stat\n0.1767\n0.1760\n0.1788\n0.1789\n0.1793\n0.1793\n0.1782\n0.1773\n0.1764\n0.1742\n0.1718\n0.1717\n0.1710\n0.1712\n0.1715\n0.1772\n\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\n0.0008\n0.0007\n0.0008\n0.0009\n0.0010\n0.0012\n0.0015\n0.0018\n0.0022\n0.0023\n0.0027\n0.0029\n0.0030\n0.0032\n0.0033\n0.0027\n\n\u03b1s (MZ2 )\n0.1164\n0.1162\n0.1173\n0.1174\n0.1176\n0.1176\n0.1171\n0.1167\n0.1163\n0.1154\n0.1144\n0.1143\n0.1140\n0.1141\n0.1142\n0.1167\n\nThe following values for parameters in the parametrizations of the\nparton distributions for the case corresponding to the last row of the\nabove table are obtained:\n2\nAH\nNS\n\n= 2.54,\n\n2\nAD\nN S = 2.38,\n\nAC\nN S = 3.29,\n\n4\n\nAFNeS = 2.35,\n\n\f2\nbH\nNS\n\n= 4.16,\n\n2\nbD\nN S = 4.22,\n\nbC\nN S = 4.23,\n\nbFNeS = 4.39,\n\n2\ndH\nNS\n\n= 6.08,\n\n2\ndD\nN S = 3.89,\n\ndC\nN S = 2.02,\n\ndFNeS = 3.31.\n\nThe parameter values of the twist-four term are presented in Table 2.\nNote that these for H2 and D2 targets are obtained in separate fits\nby analyzing SLAC, NMC and BCDMS datasets taken together.

Based on the results of fitting the value of\nthe QCD coupling constant at the normalization point was evaluated.\n\n6\n\n\f1.5\n\nLO\nNLO\nNNLO\n\n~\nh4(x)\n\n1\n\n0.5\n\n0\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n0.6\n\n0.7\n\n0.8\n\nx\nFigure 2: Comparison of the HTC parameter h\u03034 (x) obtained at LO, NLO\nand NNLO in the case of hydrogen data within a fixed-flavor-number scheme\n(nf = 4) and with no y cuts imposed on the BCDMS data.\nStarting with the reanalysis of BCDMS data by cutting off points with\nlarge systematic errors it was shown [1] that the values of \u03b1s (MZ2 ) rise\nsharply with the cuts on systematics imposed. The values \u03b1s (MZ2 ) obtained in various fits are in agreement with each other. An outcome is\nthat quite a similar result for \u03b1s (MZ2 ) was obtained [1] in the analysis\nperformed over BCDMS data (with the cuts on systematics) and that\nderived in the analyses done over the data of the rest, thus permitting\nus to fit available data altogether.\nIt turns out that for Q2 \u2265 3 GeV2 the formulae of pure perturbative\nQCD (i.e. twist-two approximation along with the target mass corrections) are enough to achieve good agreement with all the data analyzed.\nThe reference result is then found to be\n\u03b1s (MZ2 ) = 0.1167 \u00b1 0.0008 (stat) \u00b1 0.0018 (syst) \u00b1 0.0007 (norm), (7)\nUpon adding twist-four corrections, fairly good agreement between\nQCD (i.e. first two coefficients of Wilson expansion) and the data starting already at Q2 = 1 GeV2 , where the Wilson expansion begins to be\n\n7\n\n\fapplicable, is observed. This way we obtain for the coupling constant\nat Z mass peak:\n\u03b1s (MZ2 ) = 0.1167 \u00b1 0.0007 (stat) \u00b1 0.0020 (syst) \u00b1 0.0005 (norm) . (8)\nNote that there also is good agreement with the analysis [29] of the\ncombined H1 and BCDMS data, which was published by H1 collaboration. Our result for \u03b1s (MZ2 ) is also compatible with the world average\nvalue for the coupling constant presented in the review [30], 1\n\u03b1s (MZ2 ) = 0.1184 \u00b1 0.0007.\n\n(9)\n\nConcerning the contributions of higher twist corrections in the present\nwork the well-known x-shape of the twist-four corrections while going\nfrom intermediate to large values of the Bjorken variable x is well reproduced.\nAs a next step, we plan to study the DIS experimental data in the\nnon-singlet approximation along with an application of resummationlike Grunberg effective charge method [31] (as it was done in [27] at the\nNLO approximation) and the \"frozen\" [32, 33] and analytic [34] versions\nof the strong coupling constant (see [33, 35, 36] for recent studies in this\ndirection). While our less immediate goal, a singlet analysis combined\nwith a non-singlet one, is intended to be considered, with the effects\nof heavy-quark thresholds taken into account, as a follow-up to the\nprevious study [37] that deals with nonsinglet part only.\nThe work was supported by RFBR grant No.10-02-01259-a.
