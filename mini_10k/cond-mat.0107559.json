INTRODUCTION\n\nRecently there is a growing interest in a new class of lyotropic liquid crystals (LCs), so\ncalled lyotropic chromonic liquid crystals (LCLCs) due to their diverse potential application\nin many areas such as dyes, drugs, nucleic acids, antibiotics and anti-cancer agents [1],.\nDichroic thin films formed from LCLCs can be used both as alignment layers and polarizers\n\n1\n\n\ffor LC cells [2]. These materials are fundamentally different from conventional amphiphilic\nsystems: their molecules are disc-like or plank-like rather than rod-like, rigid rather than\nflexible and aromatic rather than aliphatic. Due to their disc-like molecular shape chromonic\nmolecules stack face to face forming columnar aggregates. Though there is no clear understanding of the nature of forces responsible for this face-to-face stacking, it is generally\nbelieved that the \u03c0-\u03c0 interaction of the aromatic cores is the main mechanism of molecular\nface-to-face stacking [1]. Hydrophilic ionic groups at the periphery of the molecules make\nthem water soluble. The two principal chromonic mesophases are chromonic N and M\nphase. The basic structural unit of both phases is the untilted stack of the molecules. The\nN phase is the nematic phase in which the molecular stacks has orientational order but no\npositional ordering and is formed when the concentration is low. At higher concentration\nthese molecular stacks arrange themselves in a hexagonal pattern forming the M phase.\nIn recent years, many new chromonic phases has been reported [3,4] which are formed by\naqueous cyanine dyes. Some of the liquid-crystalline aggregates formed by the cyanine dyes\nare shown in Figure 1.\nUnlike the conventional amphiphilic system, the chromonic system does not have any\ncritical micellar concentration (CMC). To avoid the unfavorable contact of the hydrophobic part of the molecules with the solvent, the molecules start to stack together forming\ncolumns even in dilute solution. As the column length increases, the fraction of the total\nmolecular surface exposed to the solvent decreases. There is widespread experimental evidence that there is no optimum column length or aggregation number like the conventional\namphiphilic system forming micellar aggregates. The micelle has a optimum size depending\non the packing parameters which in turn depend on the ratio of the size of head and tail\ngroup [5]. The chromonic aggregation behavior is termed as 'isodesmic' in contrast to the\n'non-isodesmic' behavior observed for simple amphiphilic system. For isodesmic behavior,\naddition of each chromonic molecule to the columnar aggregate is accompanied by a constant\nfree energy increment. Therefore, with the increase in column length the free energy gradually decreases, in contrast with the non-isodesmic behavior of simple surfactant system,\n2\n\n\fwhere micelle formation is accompanied by sharp free energy minima. The self-assembly of\nchromonic molecules is governed by many factors such as molecular structure, concentration,\ntemperature, solvent polarity and ionic strength. So far there is no clear understanding of\nthe relationship between molecular structure and the structure of the supramolecular aggregates formed by the LCLC materials. Consequently many different aggregate structures\nhave been proposed based on different experimental results.\nIn this paper, we have developed idealized molecular models of LCLCs which capture\nthe overall shape of the LCLC molecules and the nature of their interactions in an approximate way. To understand the self-assembly of chromonic molecules, we have carried out\nsimulations of binary mixture of LCLC molecules and water, and have studied the effect of\nconcentration, temperature and molecular shape on the nature of the resulting mesophases.\nWe have also computed the free energy associated with the addition of each chromonic\nmolecule to a columnar aggregate. The method gives us the possibility to test the widely\naccepted isodesmic behavior of the chromonic aggregation.\nThe paper is organized as follows: in section 2 we briefly describe our model and the\nsimulation technique. The results on the columnar aggregates, in bulk water, formed by the\nchromonic molecules are reported in section 3. We describe the method of computation of\nfree-energy by umbrella sampling in section 4. Finally, a summary of the main results and\nthe conclusions drawn from these are given in section 5.\n\nII. THE MODEL\n\nWe have modeled chromonic molecules as diamond shaped constituted of 9 (model 1)\ntangent spheres of diameter \u03c3 bonded together (figure 2). We also considered another\nvariant of the model where the chromonic molecules are disk shaped constituted of 7 (model\n2) tangent sphere of diameter \u03c3 bonded together (figure 2). Model 2 is similar to the model\nconsidered by Edwards et. al. [6] with different kind of interactions. In case of model 1 the 7\nspheres forming the disc are hydrophobic and the 2 spheres at the two ends are hydrophilic.\n3\n\n\fIn case of model 2, the 6 outer spheres are hydrophilic and the inner sphere at the center of\neach molecule is treated as hydrophobic. Water molecule is modeled as a sphere.\nAttractive interaction between like particles (water-water, hydrophilic-water, and\nhydrophilic-hydrophilic) is modeled via a Lennard-Jones (LJ) potential:\n\u03c3\n\u03c3\nV (r) = 4\u01eb{( )12 \u2212 ( )6 }\nr\nr\n\n(1)\n\nwhere r is the separating distance between the two interacting particles. The parameter\n\u01eb governs the strength of interaction and \u03c3 defines a length scale. We have assumed that\n\u03c3 = 1 and \u01eb = 1 for all interactions. We have taken a cut-off rc = 2.5\u03c3, large enough to\ninclude excluded volume effects and attractive forces.\nRepulsive hydrophobic-hydrophilic and water-hydrophobic interactions are modeled by\na truncated and shifted LJ potential (WCA potential):\n\u03c3\n\u03c3\nV (r) = 4\u01eb{( )12 \u2212 ( )6 } + \u01eb\nr\nr\n=0\n\notherwise.\n\nr \u2264 rc ,\n(2)\n\nwhere rc = 21/6 \u03c3.\nFor MC studies using LJ potential it is convenient to introduce reduced units. In terms of\nm, \u03c3 and \u01eb, some of the quantities of interest are density \u03c1\u2217 = \u03c1\u03c3 3 , temperature T \u2217 = kB T /\u01eb,\nand pressure P \u2217 = P \u03c3 3 /\u01eb. The simulation has been carried out both in NV T (fixed number\nof particles at constant volume and temperature) and NP T fixed number of particles at constant pressure and temperature) ensemble. During each MC step either chromonic or water\nmolecules were chosen randomly and displaced using Metropolis criteria. The reorientation\nmove was performed using quaternions [7]. We have carried out simulations for different\nconcentrations of the chromonic molecules at different temperatures. The concentration of\nchromonic is defined as\n\u03c6=\n\nxNc\nxNc + Nw\n\n(3)\n\nwhere x is the number of atoms constituting a single chromonic molecules, Nc and Nw are\n4\n\n\fthe number of chromonic and water molecules respectively, x is 9 for model 1 and 7 for\nmodel 2.\n\nIII. RESULTS\n\nIn order to investigate the spontaneous formation of chromonic aggregates and their\nmorphology, various choices of initial conditions were used. Model chromonic and water\nmolecules are initially dispersed randomly in a Lx \u00d7 Ly \u00d7 Lz system with periodic boundary\ncondition. Unless specified all of the results shown below are for model 1. Instantaneous\nsnapshots of the columnar aggregates formed by chromonic molecules are shown in figure 3\nand figure 4. At low concentration the chromonic molecules form short columns and with the\nincrease in concentration the length and the number of the columnar aggregates increases.\nAt higher concentration they form chain like aggregates.\nWe have also calculated various positional and orientational pair correlation functions\nfor the chromonic as well as water molecules to characterize the structure of the columnar\naggregates. g cc (r) is the radial distribution function of the center of mass of the chromonic\nmolecules and is defined as\n*\n\nX\n1\ng (r) =\n\u03b4(r \u2212 rcc\nij )\n\u03c1Nc i6=j\ncc\n\n+\n\n(4)\n\ng ss (r) is the same for solvent molecules (water) and is defined in an analogous way. g1cc (r)\nand g2cc (r) are the orientational correlation functions and are defined as\n*\n\n+\n\nX\n1\ncc\ncc\nP2 (ucc\ng1cc (r) =\ni * uj ) \u03b4(r \u2212 rij ) ,\n\u03c1Ng cc (r) i6=j\n\ng1cc (r)\n\n*\n\n+\n\nX\n1\ncc\ncc\nP2 (pucc\n=\ni * puj ) \u03b4(r \u2212 rij ) ,\n\u03c1Ng cc (r) i6=j\n\n(5)\n\n(6)\n\nwhere rcc\nij is the relative separation of the center of the ith and jth chromonic molecules,\ncc\npucc\ni and ui are a unit vectors lying parallel and perpendicular to the plane of the the ith\n\nchromonic molecule, P2 (x) = 3/2 cos2 (x) \u2212 1/2 is the second Legendre polynomial, and the\nsums range over all pairs of molecules.\n5\n\n\fIn practice, we work either with fully angle-averaged correlation functions, e.g.\n1 Z\ng (r) =\nd\u03a9 g cc (r, \u03a9),\n4\u03c0\ncc\n\n(7)\n\nor with cylindrically-averaged correlation functions, e.g.\n1\ng (rk , r\u22a5 ) =\n2\u03c0\ncc\n\nZ\n\n2\u03c0\n\nd\u03c6 g cc (rk , r\u22a5 , \u03c6).\n\n0\n\n(8)\n\nHere, rk and r\u22a5 denote the components of r parallel and perpendicular to the orientation\nof the disc at the origin of the coordinate frame (see figure 10(a)), i.e. rk = r * ucc and\nr\u22a5 = |r \u2212 (r * ucc )ucc |, and \u03c6 is the azimuthal orientation of r about ucc . g1cc (r) , g2cc (r) and\ng1cc (rk , r\u22a5 ) are defined in an analogous way.\nIn figure 5 we have plotted spherically averaged correlation function g cc(r) for different\nchromonic concentration and the first peak at r = 1.12\u03c3 signify strong positional correlation\nbetween chromonic molecules. Successive small peaks at r = 2.2\u03c3, 3.3\u03c3 etc. indicate that\nthe molecules aggregate in a columnar fashion as in figure 1(a) or (b).\nThe pair correlation between water molecules plotted in figure 6 exhibits the expected\nliquid like behavior with short range positional order.\nMore detailed structural informations for the chromonic aggregate emerges from the twodimensional correlation function g cc (rk , r\u22a5 ) and g1cc (rk , r\u22a5 ), shown in figure 7. With the reference chromonic molecule situated at the origin the three prominent peaks at r\u22a5 \u223c 1.1, 2.2, 3.3\nindicate that the chromonic molecules form columnar aggregates and the molecules within\nthe columns is organized as in figure 1(a). Due to close packing effect the center of mass\nof the chromonic molecules within the columns can be shifted with respect to another by \u03c3\nwhich is reflected in the broadening of the peaks around rk \u00b1 1.0. Examination of g1cc (rk , r\u22a5 )\nreveals a strong intensity (\u223c 1.0) peak around rk \u00b1 1.0 which indicates that the chromonic\nmolecules within the columns are parallel to each other.\nWe also compute average the aggregation number to study its dependence on chromonic\nconcentration. We identify two chromonic molecules belonging to a cluster if the distance\nseparating two monomers belonging to two chromonic molecules is \u2264 2.5\u03c3. From the cluster\n6\n\n\fsize distribution we have calculated the average aggregation number through the following\nequation:\n< L >=\n\nX\n\ns2 N(s)/\n\nX\n\nsN(s)\n\n(9)\n\nwhere N(s) is the number of cluster of size s. In figure 8 we have shown the average aggregate\nsize < L > as a function of chromonic concentration. At low concentration < L >\u223c \u03c60.6 .\nAt higher concentration the dependence of < L > on \u03c6 is stronger than power law. Similar\nbehavior is observed for conventional lyotropic systems [8,9].\nSince in our simulation we do not observe the formation of regular columnar aggregates as\nshown in figure 1, we have simulated pre-assembled single and multiple columnar aggregates\nto test the stability of columnar aggregates. The simulation was done in NV T ensemble.\nThe columnar aggregates remain stable over simulation time, in contrast to model 2 in\nwhich case pre-assembled columnar aggregates break and the system becomes isotropic. In\naddition our simulation with model 2 do not exhibits the spontaneous formation of columnar\naggregates (figure 9). This indicates that we need to make judicious choice of the ratio of\nnumber of hydrophilic and hydrophobic units, an overall hydrophobicity of the chromonic\nmolecules being necessary for the spontaneous self-assembly.\n\nIV. FREE ENERGY COMPUTATION BY UMBRELLA SAMPLING\n\nTo calculate the free energy associated with the formation of columnar aggregates we\nhave calculated the free energy of association in pulling apart two chromonic molecules by\nusing umbrella sampling [10]. The distance rc separating two chromonic molecules were\nconfined (figure 10) by means of a harmonic potential of the form :\n1\nU(r) = k(r \u2212 rc )2\n2\n\n(10)\n\nwhere rc is the equilibrium distance imposed between the center of mass of two chromonic\nmolecules. The equilibrium distance were varied from 1.1\u03c3 to 7\u03c3 in steps of 0.1\u03c3 - 0.2\u03c3.\n7\n\n\fNote that the equilibrium distance between two chromonic molecules can not be less than\n\u03c3. From the individual biased average probabilities, P (r), obtained for each rc , unbiased\nfree energy (F ) can be constructed self-consistently using the weighted histogram analysis\nmethod (WHAM) [11,12]. We have performed MC simulation at constant pressure for 25\nwindows. The value of the spring constant used was k = 200. We have performed some\nsimulation with higher values of spring constant k = 2000 and found qualitatively similar free\nenergy behavior. The probability distribution of the distance r separating two chromonic\nmolecules is ,\nP (r) = h\u03b4(r \u2212 rc )i\n=\n\n1\nZ\n\nZ\n\ndrN \u03b4[r \u2212 rc )] exp[\u2212\u03b2V (rN )],\n\n(11)\n\nfor values of r for which P (r) is exceedingly small. Here, \u03b4 is a Dirac delta function, N is the\nnumber of particles, rN denotes the set of particle coordinates, \u03b2 = 1/(kB T ), where kB is\nBoltzmann's constant and T is the absolute temperature, V (rN ) is the potential energy, and\nZ is a normalization factor (the configurational partition function). However, problem arises\ndue to the fact that to P (r) becomes exceedingly small for values of r which give significant\ncontribution to the free energy. Umbrella sampling makes use of a biasing potential to\nsample the region of phase space for which P (r) is exceedingly small. The distribution of r\nin the presence of a biasing potential is\nP \u2032 (r) =\n\n1\nZ\u2032\n\nZ\n\ndrN \u03b4[r \u2212 rc )]\n\nexp{\u2212\u03b2[V (rN ) + U(r)]}\n=\n\nZ\nexp[\u2212\u03b2U(r)]P (r),\nZ\u2032\n\n(12)\n\nwhere Z \u2032 is the partition function for the biased Hamiltonian. From this it follows that\nP (r) =\n\nZ\u2032\nexp[\u03b2U(r)]P \u2032 (r).\nZ\n\n(13)\n\nThus, the distribution function P (r) can be obtained (to within a multiplicative constant)\nfrom a measurement of the biased distribution P \u2032(r). The Helmholtz free energy F as a\nfunction of r can then be obtained (to within an additive constant) from\n8\n\n\fF (r) = \u2212kB T ln[P (r)].\n\n(14)\n\nBy piecing together the relative free energies measured using a number of biasing potentials,\nit is possible to construct F (r) over any specified range of r.\nWe have computed the potential of mean force of bringing two initially separated\nchromonic molecules on top of each other by the above method and the result is shown\nin figure 11. This case is referred to column 2 (figure 10(a)). From the free energy curve\nwe see that there is strong attraction between chromonic molecules at short distance, leading to face-to-face chromonic aggregation. Both energetic and entropic factors lead to this\nattraction: by stacking on top of each other the unfavorable hydrophobic interaction with\nwater molecules is reduced and this stacking results in a net increase in the volume available\nto the water molecules and thereby increasing their entropy. At intermediate separation\nwater molecules form solvation shells between the two chromonic molecules which results\nin a depletion repulsion between the chromonic molecules and thereby increasing the free\nenergy barrier between them. At larger separation two chromonics do not interact with each\nother and so the potential of mean force levels off. However, at this stage we are unable to\nseparate the entropic and energetic contribution in the free energy.\nWe have also computed different orientational pair correlations g1cc (r) and g2cc(r) between\nthe two chromonic molecules and are shown in figure 12.\nFrom the g1cc(r) we see that at the minimum separation (r = 1.0826\u03c3) the two chromonic\nmolecules are parallel and stacked together. However, their in-plane unit vectors make an\nangle to each other as is evident from g2cc(r). As the separation increases they start loosing\ntheir orientational correlations.\nNext we compute free energy of association of a chromonic molecules onto a columnar aggregates formed by two chromonics (referred to as column 3, figure 10(b)) and three\nchromonic molecules (referred to as column 4, figure 10(c)) respectively. Within the columnar aggregate, the separation and orientation of the two chromonics are kept fixed which\nwas computed at the location of the free energy minima for the column 2 case (see figure\n9\n\n\f11). The computed free energy is shown in figure 13.\nThe free energy curves has the same features as in the case column 2 (figure 11). At large\nseparation chromonic molecules do not see each other and consequently free energy reaches\na plateau at larger separation. At intermediate separation the chromonic molecules start\ninteracting with each other and start expelling the water molecules form the region between\nthem to aggregate on top of each other and this leaves more room for the water molecules.\nThis way water molecules gain entropy and chromonic molecules gain energetically (less contact with water molecules). This depletion effect eventually leads single chromonic molecules\ngoing on top of the existing columnar aggregates of length 2 or 3. Such type of depletion\nattraction and repulsion has been found between macromolecules immersed in a fluid of\nmuch smaller particles [13\u201315]. As in the case of column 2, we have also computed the\norientational pair correlation for column 3 and 4. In case of column 3, the behavior is similar to the case of column 2. However for column 4, now the chromonic molecules remain\nperfectly parallel both within and perpendicular to the chromonic plane. The presence of\nthree chromonic molecules within the aggregate strongly influence the fourth one whcih is\ncoming on top of it.\n\nV. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION\n\nWe have developed a class of idealized model for the chromonic molecules. Simple siteinteraction models represent a useful class of models for the study of the chromonic liquid\ncrystalline self-assembly. For sufficiently hydrophobic molecular models formation of columnar aggregates is observed. Our free energy computation for different length of columnar\naggregates gives valuable insight. However, more effort is required to test the isodesmic\nhypothesis. Future work will focus on improving configurational sampling (via rigid-body\nmolecular dynamics) and on investigations of chemically realistic models of chromonic LCs.\n\n10\n\n\fVI.
