BELLISSARD)\nMOULAY-TAHAR BENAMEUR AND HERV\u00c9 OYONO-OYONO\nAbstract. In the present paper, we summarize a proof of the Bellissard gaplabelling conjecture for quasi-crystals. Our main tools are the measured index\ntheorem for laminations together with the naturality of the longitudinal Chern\ncharacter.\n\n1. Introduction\nLet us consider a Schrodinger operator on Rp\nh2\n\u2206+V ,\n2m\nwhere \u2206 is the Laplacian on Rp and V is a potential. The set of observables\naffiliated to this Schrodinger operator is a C \u2217 \u2212 algebra. It must contain at least the\nC \u2217 \u2212algebra generated by operators (H \u2212 z Id)\u22121 where z belongs to the resolvent\nof H . If H describes a particle in a homogeneous media, the physical properties\nof this media do not depend upon the choice of an origin in Rp . In particular,\nthe algebra of observables must also contain the C \u2217 -algebra C \u2217 (H) generated by\nTa (H \u2212 z Id)\u22121 T\u2212a where Ta is the operator of translation by a \u2208 Rp .\nIn [2], J. Bellissard has attached to this Schrodinger operator H a compact space\n\u03a9H equipped with a minimal action of Rp such that the crossed product algebra\nC(\u03a9H ) \u22ca Rp contains C \u2217 (H) . The space \u03a9H is called the hull of H and is by\ndefinition the strong closure in B(L2 (Rp )) of the family\nH=\u2212\n\n{Ta (H \u2212 z Id)\u22121 T\u2212a ; a \u2208 Rp }\nwhere we have fixed an element z in the resolvent of H . The action of Rp on \u03a9H\nis induced by translations and up to a Rp \u2212equivariant homeomorphism, the space\n\u03a9H is independant on the choice of z in the resolvent of H .\nA typical potential for motion of conduction electrons is given by:\nX\nV (x) =\nv(x \u2212 y) ,\ny\u2208L\n\nwhere L is the point set of equilibrium positions of atoms and v is the effective\npotential for a valence electron near an atom (see [5]). This set L is uniformly\ndiscrete, i.e. there exists a positive number r such that any ball of radius r contains\nat most one point. In [5], J. Bellissard, D. J. L. Hermann and M. Zarrouati had\nattached to this point set L a compact space \u03a9L , called the hull of L equipped with\na minimal action of Rp . The space \u03a9L is called the hull of L and is constructed\nas follow: Let \u03bdL be the measure on Rp defined for every compactly supported\n1\n\n\f2\n\nM. BENAMEUR AND H. OYONO\n\nP\ncontinuous fonction f by \u03bdL (f ) =\ny\u2208L f (y) . Then \u03a9L is by defininition the\nweak-\u2217 closure (with respect to the compactly supported continuous functions on\nRp ) of the family of translations of \u03bdL by the elements of Rp . Note that V = \u03bdL \u2217 v\nand more generally, for \u03bd \u2208 \u03a9L we set:\nh2\n\u2206+\u03bd \u2217v.\n2m\nFor all z in the resolvent of the operator H , the map\nH\u03bd = \u2212\n\n\u03bd \u2208 \u03a9L 7\u2192 (H\u03bd \u2212 z Id)\u22121 \u2208 \u03a9H\nis continuous, equivariant and surjective (see [5]). Thus, the crossed product algebra\nC(\u03a9H ) \u22ca Rp lies in the crossed product algebra C(\u03a9L ) \u22ca Rp and in particular\nC(\u03a9L ) \u22ca Rp contains the algebra C \u2217 (H) . The main advantage of dealing with \u03a9L\nrather than \u03a9H is that \u03a9L only depends on the geometry of L ; For instance, if\nL is given by a rank p lattice R in Rp , then the hull of L is Rp /R . Actually in\nthis case C \u2217 (H) can be computed by using Bloch theory [2]: we can check that\nC \u2217 (H) = C(B)\u2297K , where K is the algebra of compact operator on a separable\nHilbert space and B is the Brillouin zone, defined by B = Rp /R\u2217 , where R\u2217 is the\nreciprocal lattice of R .\nTo the Schrodinger operator H is associated the integrated density of states (see\n[2]) E 7\u2192 N (E) , where N (E) is defined as the number of states by unit of volume\nwith egenvalues less or equal to E . The remarkable result of J. Bellissard, D. J. L.\nHermann and M. Zarrouati in [5] is that the integrated density of states on gaps\nmust take value in a countable subgroup of R that only depends on the point set\nL . This computation goes as follows. If P is a Rp \u2212invariant probability measure\non \u03a9L , then P induces a trace \u03c4 P on C(\u03a9L ) \u22ca Rp and this trace extends to the\nvon-Neumann algebra of C(\u03a9L ) \u22ca Rp . Let us denote by \u03c7]\u2212\u221e,E] the characteristic\nfunction of the set ]\u2212\u221e, E] . Then \u03c7]\u2212\u221e,E] (H) belongs to the von-Neumann algebra\nof C(\u03a9L )\u22ca Rp . For an ergotic probability P , J. Bellissard stated in [2] the so-called\nShubin's formula for H :\nN (E) = \u03c4 P (\u03c7]\u2212\u221e,E] (H)) .\nIn particular, if E is in a spectral gap of H , then \u03c7]\u2212\u221e,E] is a continuous function\non the spectrum of H and thus, \u03c7]\u2212\u221e,E] (H) is an idempotent in C(\u03a9L )\u22ca Rp (recall\nthat H is bounded below). In consequence, according to the Shubin formula, the\nvalue of N on spectral gaps of H belongs to the image of the additive map\n\u03c4\u2217P : K0 (C(\u03a9L ) \u22ca Rp ) \u2192 R ,\nwhere \u03c4\u2217P is the morphism induced by the trace \u03c4 P in K\u2212theory.\nWe now focus on the case where the point set L is a quasicrystal which is obtain\nby the cut-and -project method (see [10] and also [5]). To such a point set, J. Bellissard, E. Contensous and A. Legrand have associated in [3] (see also [5]) a canonical\nminimal dynamical system (TL , Zp ) which is Morita equivalent to (\u03a9L , Rp ) and\nsuch that TL is a Cantor set. Moreover, there is a canonical ergodic invariant\nprobability measure \u03bc on TL such that\n\u03c4\u2217P (K0 (C(\u03a9L ) \u22ca Rp )) = \u03c4\u2217\u03bc (K0 (C(TL ) \u22ca Zp )),\nwhere \u03c4 \u03bc is the trace on C(TL ) \u22ca Zp induced by \u03bc . Eventually, the image\n\u03c4\u2217P (K0 (C(\u03a9L ) \u22ca Rp ))\nis predicted by the following conjecture of J. Bellissard [4]:\n\n\fGAP-LABELLING FOR QUASI-CRYSTALS\n\n3\n\nLet \u03a9 be a Cantor set equipped with an action of Zp and with a Zp -invariant\nmeasure \u03bc . The measure \u03bc induces a trace \u03c4 \u03bc on the crossed product C \u2217 -algebra\nC(\u03a9) \u22ca Zp . Let us denote by Z[\u03bc] the additive subgroup of R generated by \u03bcmeasures of compact-open subsets of \u03a9 . We make the assumption that \u03a9 has no\nnon-trivial compact-open invariant subsets (this is clearly the case if the action of\nZp is minimal).\nConjecture 1. (The Bellissard gap-labelling conjecture)\n\u03c4\u2217\u03bc (K0 (C(\u03a9) \u22ca Zp )) = Z[\u03bc].\nThe goal of the present paper is to give a proof of the Bellissard conjecture. The\nmethod adopted uses the measured index theorem for laminations as proved in [13].\nAcknowledgements. We are indebted to J. Bellissard for explaining the gaplabelling problem to us and for his constant encouragements. We also would like\nto thank E. Contensous, T. Fack, J. Kellendonk, A. Legrand, V. Nistor and C.\nSchochet for several helpful discussions.\n2. The mapping torus\nLet \u03a9 be a Cantor set. Assume that the group Zp acts on \u03a9 by homeomorphisms\nand that there exists a Zp -invariant measure \u03bc on \u03a9. We assume that \u03a9 has no\ncompact-open Zp -invariant subset except \u2205 and \u03a9 . This is the case in particular if\nthe action of Zp on \u03a9 is minimal.\nThe action of Zp on \u03a9 induces an action of Zp on the C \u2217 -algebra C(\u03a9) and\nthus, we can form the crossed product C \u2217 -algebra C(\u03a9) \u22ca Zp . The measure \u03bc\ninduces a trace \u03c4 \u03bc on the C \u2217 -algebra C(\u03a9) \u22ca Zp and we obtain in this way a group\nmorphism \u03c4\u2217\u03bc : K0 (C(\u03a9) \u22ca Zp ) \u2192 R . In what follows, we shall denote by Z[\u03bc] the\nadditive subgroup of R generated by the \u03bc-measures of compact-open subsets of \u03a9\nand by C(\u03a9, Z)Zp the coinvariants of the action of Zp on C(\u03a9, Z) , i.e. the quotient\nof C(\u03a9, Z) by the subgroup generated by elements of the form n(f ) \u2212 f , where\nf \u2208 C(\u03a9, Z) and n \u2208 Zp .\nWe are interested in computing the image of K0 (C(\u03a9) \u22ca Zp ) under \u03c4\u2217\u03bc .\nIn the case p = 1 , E. Contensous proved in [9], using the Pimsner-Voiculescu six\nterm exact sequence, that the inclusion C(\u03a9) \u0592\u2192 C(\u03a9) \u22ca Z induces an isomorphism\nC(\u03a9, Z)Z \u2243 K0 (C(\u03a9) \u22ca Z) and thus,\n\u03c4\u2217\u03bc (K0 (C(\u03a9) \u22ca Z)) = Z[\u03bc] .\nIn the case p = 2 , the computation of K0 (C(\u03a9) \u22ca Z2 ) was carried out by J. Bellissard, E. Contensous and A. Legrand in [3] using the Kasparov spectral sequence.\nThe result is:\nK0 (C(\u03a9) \u22ca Z2 ) \u2243 C(\u03a9, Z)Z2 \u2295 Z.\nMore precisely:\n\u2022 The inclusion Z \u0592\u2192 K0 (C(\u03a9) \u22ca Z2 ) maps the canonical generator of Z to the\nimage, under the morphism induced by the inclusion Cr\u2217 (Z2 ) \u2192 C(\u03a9) \u22ca Z2 ,\nof the Bott generator in the K-theory of the C \u2217 -algebra Cr\u2217 (Z2 ) \u2243 C(T2 ) of\nthe discrete group Z2 .\n\u2022 The inclusion C(\u03a9, Z)Z2 \u0592\u2192 K0 (C(\u03a9)\u22caZ2 ) is induced by the inclusion C(\u03a9) \u0592\u2192\nC(\u03a9) \u22ca Z2 .\n\n\f4\n\nM. BENAMEUR AND H. OYONO\n\nRecall that the Bott generator of K0 (C(T2 )) is the unique element with Chern\ncharacter egal to the volume form of T2 . In particular, it is traceless and therefore,\nthe above computation gives:\n\u03c4\u2217\u03bc (K0 (C(\u03a9) \u22ca Z2 )) = Z[\u03bc].\nIn the case p = 3, the computation of the image of K0 (C(\u03a9)\u22caZ3 ) under the trace\nhas been recently performed by J. Bellissard, J. Kellendonk and A. Legrand [4] and\ngave the same result. These computations lead J. Bellissard to state conjecture 1.\nWe can without loss of generality assume that p is even (see [6]). From now on, p\nwill denote an even integer.\nThe group K0 (C(\u03a9)\u22caZp ) can be computed in term of Kasparov cycles out of the\nmapping torus isomorphism. We recall in the end of this section the construction\nof this isomorphism.\nThe mapping torus is by definition the space\n\u03a9 \u00d7 Rp\n.\nV\u03a9 =\nZp\nThis space is a foliated space with leaves given by the projections of {\u03c9} \u00d7 Rp in\n\u03a9 \u00d7 Rp \u2192 V\u03a9 , where \u03c9 is an element of \u03a9 .\nLet \u2202 : C \u221e (Rp )\u2297S + \u2192 C \u221e (Rp )\u2297S \u2212 be the Dirac operator on Rp where S + and\n\u2212\nS are the two irreducible spin representations of Spin(p) . The Dirac operator \u2202 is\nZp \u2212equivariant. Let e be a projection of Mn (C(V\u03a9 )) and let \u1ebd be the Zp \u2212invariant\nprojection of C(\u03a9\u00d7 Rp )\u2297 Mn (C) corresponding to e under the projection \u03a9\u00d7 Rp \u2192\nV\u03a9 . If we assume \u1ebd smooth in the Rp \u2212direction, then the operator\n\u1ebd \u25e6 (IdC(\u03a9) \u2297 \u2202 \u2297 In ) : \u1ebd(C(\u03a9)\u2297C \u221e (Rp )\u2297S + \u2297 Cn ) \u2192 \u1ebd(C(\u03a9)\u2297C \u221e (Rp )\u2297S \u2212 \u2297 Cn )\nis a Zp \u2212equivariant elliptic differential operator in the Rp \u2212direction. Hence it\ne\ninduces a longitudinal elliptic differential operator \u2202\u03a9,R\np on V\u03a9 . According to [13],\ne\ne\nthe operator \u2202\u03a9,Rp admits a K\u2212theory index IndV\u03a9 \u2202\u03a9,R\np which belongs to the Ktheory group K0 (C(\u03a9) \u22ca Zp ) .\ne\nWe can easily check that the map e 7\u2192 IndV\u03a9 (\u2202\u03a9,R\np ) induces a well defined\np\nmorphism from K0 (C0 (V\u03a9 )) to K0 (C(\u03a9) \u22ca Z ) . The following theorem is due to\nA. Connes (see [8])\ne\nTheorem 1.

The mapping torus is then V\u03a9 = Tp ,\nthe usual p\u2212torus. If e is a smooth projector in Mn (Tp ) , then \u2202{ept},Rp is just the\nDirac operator of the p\u2212torus Tp with coefficients in the vector bundle over Tp\nassociated with e . The Atiyah index formula for coverings (see [1]) asserts then\nthat\n\u03c4\u2217 (Ind \u2202{ept},Rp ) = hch([e]), [Tp ]i\nwhere \u03c4 is the canonical trace on C \u2217 (Zp ) , [Tp ] \u2208 Hp (Tp , R) is the fundamental\nclass of Tp and ch([e]) \u2208 H \u2217 (Tp , R) is the Chern character of [e] \u2208 K0 (C(V\u03a9 )) .\nThe Connes measured longitudinal index theorem (see [7]), or rather its extension\ne\nto foliated spaces (see [13]) provides such a formula for \u2202\u03a9,R\np . To state this formula\nfor V\u03a9 , we need to define suitable characteristic classes and a cycle to integrate these\n\n\fGAP-LABELLING FOR QUASI-CRYSTALS\n\n5\n\nclasses. This will be done in the two following sections. The proof of the Bellissard\nconjecture will then be given in Section 6.\n3. Longitudinal characteristic classes\nThe support for the characteristic classes involved in the measure index theorem\nfor foliation is the longitudinal cohomology of V\u03a9 . We give in this section, first the\ndefinition of this cohomology and then, the construction of the longitudinal Chern\ncharacter on K0 (C(V\u03a9 )) valued in this longitudinal cohomology.\n3.1. The longitudinal de Rham complex. Let \u03a9k (Rp ) be the space of kdifferential forms on the vector space Rp , endowed with its usual Frechet topology.\nDefinition 1. A (real) longitudinal differential k-form on V\u03a9 is a Zp -equivariant\ncontinuous map \u03c6 : \u03a9 \u2192 \u03a9k (Rp ).\nWe denote by \u03a9kl (V\u03a9 , R) the space of longitudinal differential k\u2212forms on V\u03a9 .\nIf \u03c6 is a longitudinal k\u2212form, its longitudinal differential dl (\u03c6) is by definition\nthe longitudinal (k + 1)-differential form which is given by the Zp -equivariant map\n\u03c9 7\u2192 d(\u03c6(\u03c9)) where d is the de Rham differential on Rp . Hence:\n(V\u03a9 , R)\ndl : \u03a9kl (V\u03a9 , R) \u2192 \u03a9k+1\nl\nL k\nprovides a differential structure on the graded vector space \u03a9\u2217l (V\u03a9 , R) =\n\u03a9l (V\u03a9 , R)\nand satisfies dl \u25e6 dl = 0. In what follows the superscripts e and o mean respectively even and odd forms or classes of forms. The cohomology of the complex\n(\u03a9\u2217l (V\u03a9 , R), dl ) will be denoted by\nM\nM\nH\u2217l (V\u03a9 , R) =\nHkl (V\u03a9 , R) = Hel (V\u03a9 , R)\nHol (V\u03a9 , R).\nk\u22650\n\nRemark 1. We can check (see [13]) that H\u2217l (V\u03a9 , R) is the cohomology of the sheaf of\ncontinuous functions which are locally constant in the leaf direction or equivalently\nthe sheaf of continuous and equivariant functions on equivariant open subsets of\n\u03a9 \u00d7 Rp , constant in the Rp \u2212direction. If H\u2217 (V\u03a9 , R) denotes the Cech cohomology\ngroups of V\u03a9 with real coefficients, then we have a well defined morphism:\nH\u2217 (V\u03a9 , R) \u2192 H\u2217l (V\u03a9 , R)\ninduced by the natural morphism of sheaves.\nWe define the support of a longitudinal form \u03c6 as the image of the support of\n(\u03c9, t) 7\u2192 \u03c6(\u03c9, t) under the projection \u03a9 \u00d7 Rp \u2192 V\u03a9 . The support of \u03c6 is thus a\ncompact subset of V\u03a9 . Let now U be an open subset of V\u03a9 and let \u03a9\u2217l,c (U, R) =\nL k\n\u03a9l,c (U, R) be the space of longitudinal differential k\u2212forms with support in U .\nThe restriction of the longitudinal differential dl to \u03a9\u2217l,c (U, R) preserves it and\n(\u03a9\u2217l,c (U, R), dl ) is a subcomplex of the longitudinal complex (\u03a9\u2217l (V\u03a9 , R), dl ). We\ndenote by\nM\nM\nH\u2217l,c (U, R) =\nHkl,c (U, R) = Hel,c (U, R)\nHol,c (U, R)\n\nthe cohomology of this subcomplex. Similarily, we can also define the relative\nlongitudinal cohomology for relative open pairs. A relative open pair (U0 , U1 ) is by\ndefinition given by two open subsets U0 and U1 of V\u03a9 such that U0 \u2282 U1 . From\nsuch a pair (U0 , U1 ) , we can define the differential complex (\u03a9\u2217l,c (U0 , U1 , R), dl ) as\nthe quotient differential complex in the exact sequence:\n\n\f6\n\nM. BENAMEUR AND H.

The following long exact sequence in longitudinal cohomology holds:\n* * * \u2192 Hkl,c (U0 , R) \u2192 Hkl,c (U1 , R) \u2192 Hkl,c (U0 , U1 , R) \u2192 Hk+1\nl,c (U0 , R) \u2192 * * *\n3.2. The longitudinal Chern character. We give in this subsection the definition and main properties of the longitudinal Chern character:\n[\u2217]\n\nchl : K \u2217 (V\u03a9 ) \u2192 Hl (V\u03a9 , R),\n\n\u2217 = 0, 1,\n\n[\u2217]\n\nwhere Hl = \u2295j\u2208Z Hl\u2217+2j (V\u03a9 , R).\nDefinition 2. A continuous function f on V\u03a9 is longitudinally smooth if, viewed\nas a Zp \u2212invariant function on Rp \u00d7 \u03a9 , it is smooth in the Rp \u2212direction (i.e an\nelement of \u03a9l0 (V\u03a9 , R) \u2297 C ). We denote by C \u221e,0 (V\u03a9 ) the algebra of continuous\nlongitudinally smooth functions on V\u03a9 .\nThe algebra C \u221e,0 (V\u03a9 ) is a dense subalgebra of the algebra C(V\u03a9 ) of continuous\nfunctions on V\u03a9 , which is stable under holomorphic functional calculus. Hence the\ninclusion i : C \u221e,0 (V\u03a9 ) \u0592\u2192 C(V\u03a9 ) induces an isomorphism [8]:\n\u2243\n\ni\u2217 : K0 (C \u221e,0 (V\u03a9 )) \u2192 K0 (C(V\u03a9 )) .\nLet e be a projector in Mn (C \u221e,0 (V\u03a9 )) .

The longitudinal\nChern character can also be defined for the odd K\u2212theory of C(V\u03a9 ) . Hence we\nobtain in this way a morphism\nchl : K\u2217 (C(V\u03a9 )) = K0 (C(V\u03a9 )) \u2295 K1 (C(V\u03a9 )) \u2212\u2192\nH\u2217l (V\u03a9 , R) = Hel (V\u03a9 , R) \u2295 Hol (V\u03a9 , R) .\nIf U is an open subset of V\u03a9 , we can in the same way define a longitudinal Chern\ncharacter chl : K\u2217 (C0 (U )) \u2192 H\u2217l,c (U, R) . Moreover, the longitudinal Chern character admits a relative version: for every relative open pair (U0 , U1 ) of V\u03a9 , there is\na map chl : K\u2217 (C0 (U0 \\ U1 )) \u2192 H\u2217l,c (U0 , U1 , R) . The crucial point for the proof of\nthe Bellissard conjecture is that this Chern character is compatible with the long\nexact sequences associated with a relative open pair (U0 , U1 ) of V\u03a9 [6].\nTheorem 2. The longitudinal Chern character intertwines the two following exact\nsequences:\n\u2732 K0 (C \u221e,0 (U1 ))\n0\n\nK0 (C0\u221e,0 (U0 ))\n\n\u2732 K0 (C \u221e,0 (U0 , U1 ))\n0\n\n\u273b\nK1 (C0\u221e,0 (U0 , U1 )) \u271b\nand\nHel,c (U0 , R)\n\n\u2744\nK1 (C0\u221e,0 (U0 ))\n\nK1 (C0\u221e,0 (U1 )) \u271b\n\u2732 Hel,c (U1 , R)\n\n\u2732 Hel,c (U0 , U1 , R)\n\n\u273b\nHol,c (U0 , U1 , R) \u271b\n\nHol,c (U1 , R) \u271b\n\n\u2744\nHol,c (U0 , R))\n\n4. The fundamental cycle\nWe give in this section the definition of the Ruelle-Sullivan cycle associated with\nthe Zp -invariant measure \u03bc on the foliated bundle V\u03a9 .

BENAMEUR AND H. OYONO\n\nWe end this section by identifying the top dimension group of longitudinal cohomology with the coinvariants of the algebra C(\u03a9, R) of real valued continuous\nfonction on \u03a9 . Recall that the coinvariants C(\u03a9, R)Zp of the action of Zp on\nC(\u03a9, R) is the quotient of C(\u03a9, R) by the subgroup generated by elements of the\nform n(f ) \u2212 f , where f \u2208 C(\u03a9, R) and n \u2208 Zp .\nProposition 4.

Proof of the Bellissard conjecture\nWe give in this section a proof of the Bellissard conjecture. We first recall the\nconstruction of the Kasparov spectral sequence associated with the mapping torus\nV\u03a9 (see [12]).\nLet again Tp be the p\u2212torus and let us denote for j \u2265 1 by Dj the unit open disk\nin Rj . Let Y0 \u2282 Y1 \u2282 * * * \u2282 Yp = Tp be a filtration of Tp by the skeletons of some\ntriangulation of Tp , where Yi is the i\u2212skeleton of Tp . We associate to (Yi )0\u2264i\u2264p an\nopen filtration (Zi )0\u2264i\u2264p of Tp in the following way:\n\u2022 Z0 is an open neighbourhood of Y0 which is homeomorphic to Y0 \u00d7 Dp .\n\u2022 Assume that for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 p , the open set Zi\u22121 is already constructed.

Note that the coefficient in the first homology group\ncomes from the identification K0 (C(\u03a9)) \u223c\n= C(\u03a9, Z) for totally disconnected compact spaces and that the existence of the second spectral sequence is a consequence\nof proposition 1.\nProposition 6. [11] The homology group H\u2217 (Zp , C(\u03a9, Z)) = \u2295j Hj (Zp , C(\u03a9, Z))\nis torsion free.\nRecall that there exist a Chern character in Cech cohomology K \u2217 (X) \u2192 H\u2217 (X, R)\nfor every topological space X .

For the E 2 \u2212term, the longitudinal Chern character chl and the Chern character ch both induce the inclusion\n\u2295j Hj (Zp , C(\u03a9, Z)) \u0592\u2192 \u2295j Hj (Zp , C(\u03a9, R)) . In particular, we get:\nProposition 7.

To be more accurate:\nTheorem 5.

[6] Let us denote by chkl the k\u2212component of the longitudinal\nChern character lying in Hkl (V\u03a9 , R). Then \u03c8Zp (chpl (K0 (V\u03a9 )) belongs to C(\u03a9, Z)Zp .\nProof. Let x be an element of K0 (C(V\u03a9 )) . According to theorem 5, there is an\nelement x\u2032 \u2208 K0 (C(V\u03a9 )) such that ch(x) \u2212 ch(x\u2032 ) is an homogeneous element of\ndegre p . Recall that Yp\u22121 is the p \u2212 1 skeleton of Tp . Let us denote by V\u03a9\u2032 the\ninverse image of Yp\u22121 under the fibration projection V\u03a9 \u2192 Tp and by y the image\nof x \u2212 x\u2032 under the map K0 (C(V\u03a9 )) \u2192 K0 (C(V\u03a9\u2032 ) . We can check easily that the\nChern character on V\u03a9\u2032 has no component of degre p or higher. In particular, since\nthe Chern character is natural, ch(y) \u2208 H\u2217l (V\u03a9\u2032 , R) vanishes. By using the same\ntrick as we did for V\u03a9 , we can check that K0 (C(V\u03a9\u2032 )) is torsion-free and that the\nChern character of V\u03a9\u2032 is injective.

Let (\u03a9, Zp ) be a dynamical system with \u03a9 a Cantor set and let \u03bc be a\nZp \u2212invariant measure on \u03a9 . Assume that \u03a9 has no non-trivial invariant compactopen subset. Let \u03c4\u2217\u03bc be the additive map induced by the trace \u03c4 \u03bc , associated with \u03bc,\non the K-theory of the C \u2217 -algebra C(\u03a9) \u22ca Zp . Then we have:\n\u03c4\u2217\u03bc (K0 (C(\u03a9) \u22ca Zp )) = Z[\u03bc].\nProof. As we said before, we can assume that p is even. From Theorem 1 we\ndeduce that:\n\u2032\n\ne\ne\n\u2032\n\u221e,0\n\u03c4\u2217\u03bc (K0 (C(\u03a9) \u22ca Zp )) = {IndZp ,\u03bc (\u2202\u03a9,R\n(V\u03a9 ))}.\np ) \u2212 IndZp ,\u03bc (\u2202\u03a9,Rp ), [e] \u2212 [e ] \u2208 K0 (C\n\nUsing Theorem 3, we obtain:\n\u03c4\u2217\u03bc (K0 (C(\u03a9) \u22ca Zp )) =< chpl (K 0 (V\u03a9 )), [C\u03bc,Zp ] > .\nNow, from the very definition of [C\u03bc,Zp ] and \u03c8Zp , we have:\n< x, [C\u03bc,Zp ] >=< \u03c8Zp (x), \u03bc >,\n\n\u2200x \u2208 Hpl (V\u03a9 , R).\n\nTherefore,\n< chpl (e), [C\u03bc,Zp ] >=< \u03c8Zp (chpl (e)), \u03bc > .\nBut according to Proposition 8, we have:\n\u03c8Zp (chpl (e)) \u2208 C(\u03a9, Z)Zp .\nHence:\n\u03c4\u2217\u03bc (K0 (C(\u03a9) \u22ca Zp )) \u2282 \u03bc(C(\u03a9, Z)Zp ) = Z[\u03bc].\nSince the opposite inclusion is straightforward to check, the proof is complete.\nReferences\n[1] M.F.Atiyah, Elliptic operators, discrete groups, and Von Neuman algebras, Ast\u00e9risque 3233, 1976, 43-72.\n[2] J.Bellissard, Gap labelling theorem's for Schrodinger's operators, in: M.
