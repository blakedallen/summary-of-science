Verbitsky, March 6, 2007\n\nIntroduction\nPrincipal toric bundles were always a source of examples in complex geometry (classical Hopf manifolds and Calabi-Eckmann spaces come to mind), but\nthe recent progress in string theory in interaction with algebraic geometry\nputs a new light on this classical subject. Since a discovery of the hypercomplex structures on compact Lie groups and other homogeneous spaces\nby the physicists Spindel et al ([SSTV]) and then Joyce ([J]), the complex\ngeometry of homogeneous spaces became a focus of much research, being\na target space of supersymmetric string theories with rich supersymmetry.\nHowever, the algebraic geometry of these spaces is not much understood.\nThis paper is an attempt to fill this gap, bringing a number of results about\nsubvarieties of principal toric bundles, in particular - compact homogeneous\ncompex manifolds with abelian fundamental group.\nA principal toric bundle M is a complex manifold equipped with a free\nholomorphic action of a compact complex torus T . Such a manifold is fibered\nover M/T , with fiber T . In the sequel, we discuss positivity in fiber bundles\nand define positive toric bundles, generalizing a notion developed for elliptic\nbundles in [V].\nMany examples of principal toric bundles appear from a theory of complex homogeneous manifolds. It is known since 1960-es that a simply connected compact complex homogeneous manifold is a principal toric fibration\nover a rational projective homogeneous manifold (this is known as the Tits\nfibration). In fact, this result holds for a complex homogeneous manifold\nwith abelian fundamental group (Theorem 2.3).\nA principal toric fibration obtained this way from a general complex\nstructure on a Lie group is always positive (Theorem 2.7).\nWe study complex subvarieties of positive principal toric fibrations. Given\nan irreducible complex subvariety X \u2282 M of a positive principal toric bundle, we show that either X is T -invariant, or it lies in an orbit of T -action\n(Theorem 1.13).\nThis theorem is elementary for dimC T = 1, but for dimC T > 1 the\nproof uses highly non-trivial results on deformation theory and the spaces\nof Fujiki class C, which are due to Fujiki and Demailly-Paun.\n\n2\n\n\fPositive toric fibrations\n\n1\n1.1\n\nM. Verbitsky, March 6, 2007\n\nPositivity in fiber bundles\nPositive elliptic fibrations\n\nFor holomorphic vector bundles and principal elliptic bundles, the subject\nof positivity is well established. These notions are related geometrically, as\nwe shall explain now.\nLet X be a projective manifold, and L a holomorphic line bundle on X.\nPositivity of L manifests itself in the geometric properties of the total space\nTot(L\u2217 ) of the non-zero vectors in the dual bundle, which is a principal\n\u03c0\nC\u2217 -fibration over X. When L is positive, the projection Tot(L\u2217 ) \u2212\u2192 X\nhas no multisections. Indeed, any such multisection, that is, a subvariety\nX \u2032 \u2282 Tot(L\u2217 ) which is surjective and finite over X, gives a holomorphic\nsection \u03b3X \u2032 of (L\u2217 )\u2297N , where N is cardinality of \u03c0 \u22121 (x) \u2229 X \u2032 for general\nx \u2208 X. The section \u03b3X \u2032 is defined as a functional on (L)\u2297N , mapping\nv1 \u2297 v2 \u2297 ... \u2297 vN \u2208 LN\n\nx\n\nto\nY\n\nvi (zi ).\n\nzi \u2208\u03c0 \u22121 (x)\u2229X \u2032\n\u03c0\n\nWhen L is positive, (L\u2217 )N has no sections, hence Tot(L\u2217 ) \u2212\u2192 X has no\nmultisections.\nFor example, when X is CP n and L is O(1), Tot(L\u2217 ) is identified with\nn+1\nC\n\\0. This space is quasi-affine and cannot contain compact subvarieties.\nThis effect is even more striking if we take a quotient M := Tot(L\u2217 )/hqi\nof Tot(L\u2217 ) by the Z-action mapping v to qv, where q \u2208 C\u2217 is a fixed number,\n|q| > 1. This quotient is a principal elliptic bundle over X, with the fiber\nisomorphic to T = C\u2217 /hqi. When L is positive, this manifold is called a\nregular Vaisman manifold (see e.g [DO], [OV2]).\nIt was shown (see e.g. [V]) positive-dimensional complex subvarieties\nof this principal elliptic fibration are T -invariant whenever L is ample. In\nother words, for any closed subvariety Z \u2282 M , Z is a preimage of Z1 \u2282 X,\nfor some complex subvariety of X.\nIf, in addition, dimC X > 1, a similar result is true for all stable holomorphic bundles on M , and even all stable reflexive coherent sheaves on M .\nNamely, given a stable reflexive coherent sheaf F , there exists a line bundle\nL on M such that F \u223c\n= \u03c0 \u2217 F1 \u2297 L, where F1 is a stable coherent sheaf on X\n([V]).\n\n3\n\n\fPositive toric fibrations\n\nM. Verbitsky, March 6, 2007\n\nThis result has a number of far-reaching consequences, even in the most\ntrivial example when X = CP n , L = O(1) and M = Cn+1 \\0/hqi is a classical\nHopf manifold. However, the argument of [V] is much more general, and\ncan be applied to other principal elliptic bundles.\nDefinition 1.1: A principal elliptic fibration, or a principal elliptic\nbundle is a complex manifold M equipped with a free holomorphic action of\na 1-dimensional compact complex torus T . We consider a principal elliptic\n\u03c0\nfibration as a T -fibration M \u2212\u2192 M/T .\nExamples of these include the Hopf manifold and regular Vaisman manifolds defined above, but also such interesting objects as a Calabi-Eckmann\nmanifold, that is, a product of two odd-dimensional spheres S 2n\u22121 \u00d7 S 2m\u22121 ,\nm, n > 1, equipped with an SO(2n) \u00d7 SO(2m)-invariant complex structure\n(see Subsection 2.3). In [V], the positivity of principal elliptic bundles was\ndefined as follows.\n\u03c0\n\nDefinition 1.2: Let M \u2212\u2192 X be a principal elliptic fibration, with X\na K\u00e4hler manifold. We call \u03c0 a positive elliptic fibration, if for some\nK\u00e4hler form \u03c9 on X, \u03c0 \u2217 \u03c9 is exact.\n\u03c0\n\nOf course, all principal elliptic fibrations M \u2212\u2192 X with H 2 (M ) = 0\nand X K\u00e4hler are necessarily positive. This includes all Hopf manifolds\n(which are diffeomorphic to S 1 \u00d7 S 2n\u22121 ) and the Calabi-Eckmann manifolds\nS 2n\u22121 \u00d7 S 2m\u22121 .\nFor a manifold M := Tot(L\u2217 )/hqi considered above, positivity is equivalent to the positivity of the corresponding line bunlde L.\nThe positivity of elliptic fibrations has powerful geometric applications.\n\u03c0\n\nTheorem 1.3: ([V]) Let X be a compact K\u00e4hler manifold, and M \u2212\u2192 X\na positive principal elliptic fibration. Then, for any positive-dimensional,\nirreducible subvariety Z \u2282 M , Z = \u03c0 \u22121 (Z1 ), for some complex subvariety\nZ1 \u2282 X. If, in addition, dimC X > 1, then for any stable reflexive coherent\nsheaf F on M , F = \u03c0 \u2217 F1 \u2297 L, where F1 is a stable coherent sheaf on X and\nL a line bundle.\n\n4\n\n\fPositive toric fibrations\n\n1.2\n\nM. Verbitsky, March 6, 2007\n\nConvexity and positivity\n\nFor the purposes of the present paper, a good notion of positivity in fiber\nbundles would give the same consequences as in Theorem 1.3. All irreducible\n\u03c0\nsubvarieties of a positive fiber bundle M \u2212\u2192 X should lie in the fiber or\nhave the form \u03c0 \u22121 (Z); and all stable bundles must be pullbacks, up to\ntensoring with a line bundle.\nFurther on in this paper, we study principal toric fibrations, that is,\nfibrations with a fiber which is a compact complex torus. They are defined\nin the same way as principal elliptic fibrations.\nDefinition 1.4: Let T be a compact complex torus. A principal toric\nfibration, or a principal toric bundle with a fiber T is a complex manifold\nM equipped with a free holomorphic action of T . We consider a principal\n\u03c0\ntoric fibration as a T -fibration M \u2212\u2192 M/T .\nPrincipal toric fibrations appear in different disguises in all kinds of\nalgebro-geometric research. A classification of these objects is found in [H\u00f6].\nEven for principal toric fibrations, it is not clear what is a good notion\nof positivity. One could require that \u03c0 \u2217 \u03c9 is exact, for some K\u00e4hler form \u03c9\non X. This is clearly not enough. Indeed, one could take a positive elliptic\nfibration, and its product with a torus T1 , as a toric fibration. The pullback\n\u03c0 \u2217 \u03c9 is exact. However, any subvariety of X \u00d7 T1 (and there could be many)\ngives a corresponding subvariety of M .\nStill, this notion has useful geometric consequences.\n\u03c0\n\nDefinition 1.5: Let M \u2212\u2192 X be a fibration of complex manifolds. We\nsay that \u03c0 is convex if for some K\u00e4hler form \u03c9 on X, \u03c0 \u2217 \u03c9 is exact.\n\u03c0\n\nDefinition 1.6: Let M \u2212\u2192 X be a fibration of complex manifolds, and\nX \u2032 \u2282 M a closed subvariety. Assume that the restriction \u03c0 X \u2032 : X \u2032 \u2212\u2192 X is\n\nproper, surjective and generically finite. Then X \u2032 is called a multisection\nof \u03c0.\n\nThe following trivial lemma explains the utility of convexity in fiber\nbundles.\n\u03c0\n\nLemma 1.7: Let M \u2212\u2192 X be a morphism of complex manifolds, X\ncompact and K\u00e4hler, \u03c9 a K\u00e4hler class.

A\ngeneric complex torus is simple; a generic abelian variety is also simple.

These manifolds were\nclassicied by H. C. Wang ([Wa]) and much studied during 1950-ies and the\n1960-ies. H. Samelson ([Sa]) discovered homogeneous complex structures\non even-dimensional semisimple Lie groups. In 1980-es and 1990-ies the\nSamelson manifolds became more and more important in string physics,\ndifferential geometry and algebraic geometry.\nEver since the physicists Spindel et al ([SSTV]) and then Joyce ([J])\nconstructed homogeneous hypercomplex structures on some compact Lie\ngroups, generalizing Samelson's work, these manifolds became a favourite\ntestbed for all kinds of conjectures and constructions in quaternionic geometry and sometimes in physics (see e.g. [OP]). In addition, these manifolds\nare examples of two rather unique (and mysteriously related) geometries,\nwhich arose in string theory. The Joyce's hypercomplex manifolds are the\nonly known in dimension > 4 examples of so-called strong HKT geometry\n([HP], [GP]). In addition, these manifolds are among the few compact examples of generalized K\u00e4hler manifolds (known in physics as manifolds with\n(2,2)-supersymmetry); see [GHR], [Hi]. Combining these two structures,\none obtains an even more mysterious (and rare) geometry, called generalized\nhyperk\u00e4hler geometry, or (4,4)-supersymmetry ([GHR], [Br], [MV]), which\nalso occurs on Joyce's hypercomplex manifolds.\nFrom their construction, which is explained in Subsection 2.3, it is clear\nthat the Samelson manifolds are fibered over a flag space, with fibers being compact tori. It is a special case of a general result due to Borel and\nRemmert ([BR]) and Tits ([T]), and its generalization, proven in this paper\n(Theorem 2.3); see also [GR].\nTheorem 2.1: Let M be a compact, homogeneous, simply connected complex manifold. Then M is a principal toric fibration over a base X, which\nis a homogeneous, rational, projective manifold.\n8\n\n\fPositive toric fibrations\n\nM. Verbitsky, March 6, 2007\n\nProof: Recall that a complex manifold is called parallelizable if its\nholomorphic tangent bundle is trivial. The following lemma is used.\nLemma 2.2: ([T]) Let M , dimC M = n be a compact homogeneous complex\nmanifold with trivial canonical bundle. Then M is parallelizable.\nProof: The holomorphic tangent bundle T M is globally generated.\nChose a set \u03b31 , ..., \u03b3n of holomorphic vector fields which are linearly independent at m \u2208 M . Since the canonical bundle of M is trivial, \u03b31 , ..., \u03b3n\nare linearly independent everywhere.\nReturn to the proof of Theorem 2.1. Since T M is globally generated, the\nanticanonical bundle K \u22121 M is globally generated too, hence base point free.\n\u03c8\n\nThis gives a holomorphic morphism M \u2212\u2192 P(\u0393(K \u22121 M )) from M to the\nprojectivization of the space of sections of K \u22121 M . This map is obviously\nequivariant with respect to the action of the group G = Aut(M ). Therefore,\nthe projective manifold B = \u03c8(M ) is homogeneous, and hence rational. By\nadjunction formula, the fibers F of \u03c8 have trivial canonical class; Lemma 2.2\nimplies that they are parallelizable. Using the homotopy exact sequence for\na fibration\n\u03c02 (B) \u2212\u2192 \u03c01 (F ) \u2212\u2192 \u03c01 (M ) = 0,\nwe obtain that the fundamental group of F is abelian. Therefore, F is a\ncomplex torus (see the proof of Theorem 2.3 below for a detailed argument).\nThe sheaf T\u03c8 M of holomorphic vector fields tangent to the fibers of \u03c8 is a\ntrivial bundle, by the same reasining as used to prove Lemma 2.2. Let\nG0 \u2282 Aut(M ) be a Lie group generated by the sections of T\u03c8 M . Identifying\nG with the group of automorphisms of fibers of \u03c8, we obtain that G is a\ncompact torus, and \u03c8 : M \u2212\u2192 X is a principal toric fibration.\n\n2.2\n\nA generalization of Borel-Remmert-Tits theorem\n\nBorel-Remmert-Tits theorem has a generalization, which is quite useful in\nour work.\nTheorem 2.3: Let M be a compact complex manifold equipped with a\ntransitive holomorphic action of a Lie group G. Assume that M admits\na G-invariant decomposition M = M0 \u00d7 (S 1 )n , where \u03c01 (M0 ) = 0. Let\n\n9\n\n\fPositive toric fibrations\n\nM. Verbitsky, March 6, 2007\n\n\u03c8 : M \u2212\u2192 B \u2282 P(H 0 (K \u22121 )) be the G-equivarant fibration constructed in\nthe proof of Theorem 2.1. Then \u03c8 is a principal toric fibraton.\nProof: As we have shown, the fibers F of \u03c0 are compact, homogeneous\nmanifolds which are holomorphically parallelizable, that is, have trivial tangent bundle. To prove Theorem 2.3 we have to show that these fibers are\ncomplex tori. It is well known (see [Wo]) that such manifolds are always\nof form F = G/\u0393, where G is a complex Lie group, and \u0393 a cocompact\nlattice. To prove that F is a torus, it suffices to show that \u03c01 (F ) is abelian.\nIndeed, \u0393 is a subgroup of \u03c01 (M ), and (being a cocompact lattice), \u0393 is\nZariski dense in G, hence G is also abelian. We reduced Theorem 2.3 to the\nfollowing lemma.\nLemma 2.4: In assumptions of Theorem 2.3, we have a decomposition F =\nF0 \u00d7 (S 1 )n , where \u03c01 (F0 ) = \u03c02 (B)/j(\u03c02 (M )), where j : \u03c02 (M ) \u2212\u2192 \u03c02 (M )\nis the map induced by the projection.\nProof: Since G preserves the decomposition M = M0 \u00d7 (S 1 )n , G contains a torus T n = (S 1 )n acting trivially on M0 and tautologically on (S 1 )n .\nConsider the natural action of T n \u2282 G on B. If any of its orbits has positive\ndimension, it is isomorphic to a quotient T = T n /T0 . This gives a free holomorphic action of a torus T on B. This is impossible, because B is rational,\nand any holomorphic vector field on B vanishes somewhere. We have shown\nthat T n acts trivially on B, and the map \u03c8 : M \u2212\u2192 B factors through the\n\u03c0\nstandard projection M = M0 \u00d7 (S 1 )n \u2212\u2192 M0 . Therefore, F = F0 \u00d7 T n ,\nwith F0 being a fiber of the standard fibration M0 \u2212\u2192 B. To see that the\nfundamental group of F0 is abelian, we use an exact sequence of homotopy\nj\n\n\u03c02 (M0 ) \u2212\u2192 \u03c02 (B) \u2212\u2192 \u03c01 (F0 ) \u2212\u2192 \u03c01 (M0 ) = 0.\nassociated to the fibration M0 \u2212\u2192 B. This gives an isomorphism \u03c01 (F0 ) =\n\u03c02 (B)/j(\u03c02 (M )). Lemma 2.4 is proven. We proved Theorem 2.3.\nRemark 2.5: This theorem has a generalization, also due to J. Tits ([T]).\nLet M be a compact homogeneous manifold, with a Lie group G acting on\nM transitively. Then M is fibered over a projective, rational, homogeneous\nspace with a fiber which is homogeneous and paralellizable. This fibration\nis called the Tits fibration. Tits also proved that it is G-invariant, and\nuniversal.\n\n10\n\n\fPositive toric fibrations\n\nM. Verbitsky, March 6, 2007\n\nQuite often, a compact, homogeneous complex manifold would have\nH 2 (M, Q) = 0. The Calabi-Eckmann manifolds and the Hopf manifolds\nwe mentioned previously clearly satisfy H 2 (M ) = 0. Let G be a compact\nLie group with H 1 (G, Q) = 0. The cohomology algebra of G is a Hopf\nalgebra; by Hopf theorem ([Ho]), H \u2217 (G, Q) is a free exterior algebra, with\ngenerators of odd degree. In particular, H 2 (G, Q) = 0.\nIf G is even-dimensional, G admits a left-invariant complex structure;\nif G is odd-dimensional, G \u00d7 S 1 admits a left-invariant complex structure.\nThese manifolds are called Samelson spaces (see Subsection 2.4). In both\nof these cases, H 2 (M, Q) = 0, and the corresponding principal toric bundle\n(Theorem 2.3) is convex. If the torus T is, in addition, simple, M is Qpositive. Further on in this section, we explain that this happens for generic\ncomplex structures on G and G \u00d7 S 1 .\n\n2.3\n\nThe Calabi-Eckmann construction\n\nThe complex structures on the Lie groups can be constructed explicitly, in\nsuch a way that the principal toric action becomes apparent. To see this we\nfirst review the construction of Calabi-Eckmann manifolds.\nConsider the principal C\u2217 \u00d7 C\u2217 -fibration\nM\u0303 = Cn \\0 \u00d7 Cm \\0 \u2212\u2192 X = CP n\u22121 \u00d7 CP m\u22121 .\nGiven a subgroup G \u2282 C\u2217 \u00d7 C\u2217 , we obtain an associated fiber bundle MG =\nM\u0303 /G \u2212\u2192 X, with a fiber C\u2217 \u00d7 C\u2217 /G. We parametrize C\u2217 \u00d7 C\u2217 by the set\nof pairs et1 \u00d7 et2 , t1 , t2 \u2208 C. Given a number \u03b1 \u2208 C\\R, we observe that the\nsubgroup\nG := {et \u00d7 e\u03b1t \u2282 C\u2217 \u00d7 C\u2217 , t \u2208 C} \u2282 C\u2217 \u00d7 C\u2217\n\nis co-compact, and the quotient C\u2217 \u00d7 C\u2217 /G is an elliptic curve T , isomorphic\nto the quotient\n\u221a\n\u221a\nC/h2\u03c0 \u22121 n + 2\u03c0\u03b1 \u22121 mi, n, m \u2208 Z\nTherefore, the fibration MG \u2212\u2192 X is an elliptic fibration, with fiber T ; it is\neasy to check that MG is actually diffeomorphic to S 2n\u22121 \u00d7 S 2m\u22121 . We have\nconstructed the Calabi-Eckmann manifold.\nA similar construction will work whenever we have a principal (C\u2217 )2n bundle M\u0303 \u2212\u2192 X. We may identify (C\u2217 )2n with a quotient of W = C2n by\na subgroup\n( 2n\n)\nX \u221a\n2\u03c0 \u22121 ki | ki \u2208 Z\n\u0393=\ni=1\n\n11\n\n\fPositive toric fibrations\n\nM.

Choosing an n-dimensional complex subspace V \u2282 W\nnot intersecting R\u0393, we find that the quotient T = W/hV + \u0393i is a compact\ntorus (this is actually a standard construction of compact tori, used in their\nclassification).\nNow consider V as a subgroup of (C\u2217 )2n = C2n /\u0393. Clearly, the quotient\nM\u0303 /V is a principal toric bundle over X, with fiber T .\n\n2.4\n\nSamelson spaces\n\nThe left-invariant complex structures on Lie groups were constructed by H.\nSamelson in 1954 ([Sa]).\nDefinition 2.6: Let G be an even-dimensional, compact, semisimple Lie\ngroup, and I a left-invariant complex structure on G. Then (G, I) is called\na Samelson space. It is a homogeneous complex manifold.\nLet G be an even-dimensional compact Lie group; it is obviously semisimple. Denote by GC its complexification, and let B \u2282 GC be its Borel subgroup, and F = GC /B the corresponding flag space, which is obviously\ncompact. The group G can be considered as a subgroup in GC ; the natural\nprojection G \u2212\u2192 F is surjective, and has the maximal torus of G as its fiber.\nThis is the toric fibration we require; it remains only to produce a complex\nstructure on G which is compatible with this fibration.\nDenote by U the unipotent radical of B. The space M\u0303 := GC /U is fibered\nover F with a fiber TC = (C\u2217 )k , with k = dimR G \u2212 2 dimC F being even.\nWe arrive at the situation described at the end of Subsection 2.3: a (C\u2217 )2n fibration over a compact base. Taking a quotient of M\u0303 with a subgroup\nV \u2282 TC = isomorphic to Cn , as indicated in Subsection 2.3, we obtain\na principal toric fibration M = M\u0303 /V . Embedding G into M\u0303 = GC /U ,\nand projecting to M , we identify G with M , and this identification is by\nconstruction G-invariant.\nClearly, this principal fibration is the one postulated by Borel-RemmertTits theorem (Theorem 2.1).\nNotice that we have a complete freedom of choosing V \u2282 TC . Therefore the left-invariant complex structure on G can be chosen in such a way\nthat any given torus of appropriate dimension becomes a fiber of the Tits\nfibration.\nThere is another construction of Samelson manifolds, which is even\nmore elementary and explicit. Take the Lie algebra g of a compact, evendimensional Lie group G, and let gC be its complexification. Take a positive\n12\n\n\fPositive toric fibrations\n\nM. Verbitsky, March 6, 2007\n\nroot system e1 , ..., en \u2208 gC , and let f1 , ..., fn the corresponding negative\nroots, and hC \u2282 gC be the corresponding Cartan subalgebra, so that\ngC = he1 , ..., en , f1 , ..., fn i \u2295 hC .\nLet h be a Lie algebra of a maximal torus of G such that hC is its complexification. The space g is decomposed as\ng = h \u2295 F,\nwhere F is the space of real vectors in he1 , ..., en , f1 , ..., fn i. Since dim G is\neven, the real vector space h is even-dimensional.\nNow choose a complex structure I on g , in such a way that the decomposition g = h \u2295 F is preserved. To define a complex structure I on F it is\nthe same as to define a decomposition\n\nwith F1,0\ndefine\n\nF \u2297 C = F1,0 \u2295 F0,1 ,\n\u221a\n\u221a\n= F0,1 , and I acting as \u22121 on F1,0 and as \u2212 \u22121 on F0,1 . We\nF1,0 = he1 , ..., en i, F1,0 = hf1 , ..., fn i.\n\nChoose the action of I on h arbitrarily.\nUsing the left action of G on itself, I becomes a left-invariant almost\ncomplex structure I. By Newlander-Nirenberg, I is integrable if and only if\n[T 0,1 G, T 0,1 G] \u2282 T 0,1 G. This is equivalent to\n[g0,1 , g0,1 ] \u2282 g0,1 ,\n\n\u221a\nwhere g0,1 \u2282 gC is a space of all vectors where I acts as \u2212 \u22121 . However,\nfrom the construction of I it is apparent that g0,1 is identified with a subspace of Cartan algebra plus hf1 , ..., fn i, and such a space is closed under\ncommutators.\nIt is not difficult to check that this construction is in fact identical to\nthat we gave earlier. The same argument was used by Samelson to construct\nan invariant complex structure on G/T , where G is a compact Lie group and\nT \u2282 G a compact torus of even codimension in G.\nWe conclude this section with the following theorem, which follows from\nthe constructions we have given.\nTheorem 2.7: Let G be a compact, even-dimensional Lie group, and I\na left-invariant complex structure on G.

Then the fibration \u03c0 is Q-positive.\nProof: Let\nG = G0 \u00d7 S1k ,\n\nwhere G0 is a semisimple group with H 1 (G0 , Q) = 0. Such a decomposition\nfollows from the classification of compact Lie groups. It is easy to see that G\nis a toric fibration over the flag space F associated with G0 ([Sa]). However,\n\u03c0\nH 2 (G0 , Q) = 0 as we have mentioned above. The Tits map G \u2212\u2192 F is\na composition of the projection G \u2212\u2192 G0 and the natural map G0 \u2212\u2192 F .\nTherefore, the pull-back homomorphism\n\u03c0 \u2217 : H 2 (F, R) \u2212\u2192 H 2 (G, R)\nvanishes. We obtain that \u03c0 \u2217 \u03c9 is exact for any K\u00e4hler form \u03c9 on F . This\nimplies that (G, I) is convex. Using Claim 1.18, we obtain that (G, I) is\nQ-positive.\nRemark 2.8: The same argument works to show that for any torus T \u2282 G of\neven codimension in a compact Lie group G, a generic left-invariant complex\nstructure on G/T is Q-positive.

A K\u00e4hler current\nis a closed (1, 1)-current \u03b7 such that there exists a Hermitian form \u03c9 on M\nwith \u03b7 \u2212 \u03c9 is positive.\nThe cohomology classes of non-smooth K\u00e4hler currents can be nonK\u00e4hler. For instance, take a divizor Z \u2282 M . The divizor Z can be considered as a (1,1)-current by taking\nZ\n\u03c8.\nhZ, \u03c8i :=\nZ\n\n15\n\n\fPositive toric fibrations\n\nM. Verbitsky, March 6, 2007\n\nIf Z is an exceptional divizor, and \u03c9 a K\u00e4hler form, \u03bb \u2208 R>0 , the current\n\u03c9 + \u03bbZ is K\u00e4hler, but for \u03bb sufficiently big, its cohomology class is clearly\nnon-K\u00e4hler.\nDemailly and Paun proved the following theorem.\nTheorem 3.5: ([DP, Theorem 3.4]) Let M be a compact complex manifold.\nThen M lies in Fujiki class C if and only if M supports a K\u00e4hler current.\n\nRemark 3.6: Such a K\u00e4hler current is easy to construct. Given a bimeromorphism M \u223c M1 , where M1 is K\u00e4hler, and using Hironaka desingularization theorem, we can construct a resolution M2 which dominates M and M1\nand is obtained by sequence of blow-ups with smooth centers. A blow-up of\na K\u00e4hler manifold is again K\u00e4hler, hence M2 is K\u00e4hler. Consider the map\n\u03c0\nM2 \u2212\u2192 M ; it is bimeromorphic and holomorphic. Let \u03c9 be a K\u00e4hler form\non M2 . We consider \u03c9 as a current \u03c9 on M using the formula\nh\u03c9, \u03c8i := h\u03c9, \u03c0 \u2217 \u03c8i,\nThis current is obviusly positive and K\u00e4hler.\nFurther on, we shall need the following proposition.\nProposition 3.7: Let M be a compact complex variety of Fujiki class C\nand G a compact Lie group acting on M holomorphically. Then M admits\na G-equivariant, smooth K\u00e4hler resolution of singularities, with G-invariant\nK\u00e4hler metric.\nProof: Without restricting the generality, we may assume that M is\nsmooth. In this case, property C is equivalent to existence of a K\u00e4hler\ncurrent. Averaging with G, we may assume that this K\u00e4hler current is Ginvariant. The proof of Theorem 3.5 involves approximating a given K\u00e4hler\ncurrent by K\u00e4hler currents with controlled logarithmic singularities at Zk ,\nand blowing up the corresponding singular sets ([DP, Theorem 3.2]). The\nsets Zk are obtained explicitly as zeroes of multiplier ideal sheaves with\nprescribed weights on M ([D]). These weights can be chosen G-invariant,\nbecause (as seen from the proof) the corresponding weights \u03c8k satisfy |\u03c8k \u2212\ng\u03c8k | < C, for any g \u2208 G. This implies that Zk can be chosen G-invariant.\nTherefore, the K\u00e4hler blow-up of M can be achieved by blowing up the\nG-invariant subvarieties. This implies existence of a G-equivariant K\u00e4hler\n16\n\n\fPositive toric fibrations\n\nM. Verbitsky, March 6, 2007\n\nresolution of M . Averaging the K\u00e4hler form with G, we obtain a G-invariant\nK\u00e4hler metric.\n\n3.2\n\nMultisections of fiber bundles and positivity\n\u03c0\n\nV\nRecall that a multisection of a fiber bundle MV \u2212\u2192\nX is an irreducible\nsubvariety X \u2032 \u0592\u2192 MV which is proper and finite over a general point of X.\nThe main result of this section is the following theorem, which ensures\nthat under appropriate conditions a fiber bundle associated with a principal\ntoric bundle does not admit multisections.\n\n\u03c0\n\nTheorem 3.8: Let M \u2212\u2192 X be a principal toric bundle, with fiber T , and\nV a compact complex variety of Fujiki class C, equipped with a holomorphic\n\u03c0V\nT -action. Consider the associated fiber bundle MV \u2212\u2192\nX, MV = M \u00d7V /T ,\nand let X \u2032 \u0592\u2192 MV be its multisection. Assume that M is compact and\nweakly Q-positive. Then X \u2032 is T -invariant.\nProof:\nStep 1. Without restricting the generality, we may assume that X \u2032\nintersects the smooth part of MV . Indeed, if X \u2032 lies in the singular part Vsing\nof V , we may replace MV with MVsing . If, again, X \u2032 lies in the singular part\nof Vsing , we replace Vsing with its singular part and so on. Using induction\nby dim V , we obtain that at some step we arrive at the situation when X \u2032\nintersects the non-singular part.\nStep 2. Let T0 \u2282 T be a stabilizer St(z) of a generic point z \u2208 X \u2032 .\nIf T = T0 , Theorem 3.8 is proven. Replacing T by T /T0 , and V by its\nsubset fixed by T0 , we arrive at assumptions of Theorem 3.8; however, now\nSt(z) = 0 for generic z \u2208 X \u2032 . It suffices to prove Theorem 3.8 in this\nassumption.\nStep 3. Let V \u2032 be a T -equivariant K\u00e4hler resolution of singularities\nof V , which exists by Proposition 3.7. A proper preimage of X \u2032 under the\n\u03c0V \u2032\nX. Hence it suffices\nnatural map MV \u2032 \u2212\u2192 MV is a multisection of MV \u2032 \u2212\u2192\nto prove Theorem 3.8 assuming that V is K\u00e4hler and smooth.\nStep 4. For any holomorphic action of a torus T on a complex manifold\nZ, denote by St0 (z) \u2282 T the connected component of the stabilizer of z \u2208 Z,\n\n17\n\n\fPositive toric fibrations\n\nM. Verbitsky, March 6, 2007\n\nand by T0 the connected component of the group\n{t \u2208 T | t acts trivially on Z}.\nThen St0 (z) = T0 . Indeed, St0 (z)/T0 acts faithfully on Sym\u2217 (Tz Z), and\nthis gives a holomorphic embedding of St0 (z)/T0 into an algebraic group,\nwhich is affine, and hence Stein. Since St0 (z) is holomorphic and compact,\nsuch an embedding is necessarily trivial.\nIn Steps 1-3, we have reduced Theorem 3.8 to the case when V is K\u00e4hler\nand smooth, and the action of T is free generically. Because of Step 4, it\nremains now to prove Theorem 3.8 assuming that V is K\u00e4hler and smooth,\nand for any v \u2208 V , the stabilizer St(v) is finite.\nNow Theorem 3.8 can be deduced from the following lemma.\n\u03c0\n\nLemma 3.9: Let M \u2212\u2192 X be a principal toric bundle with fiber T , and\nV \u2013 a K\u00e4hler manifold equipped with an action of T . Assume that X is\ncompact, M is weakly convex, and for any v \u2208 V , the stabilizer St(v) is\n\u03c0V\nfinite. Consider the associated fibration MV \u2212\u2192\nX. Then \u03c0V admits no\nmultisections.\nProof: Let \u03c9 be a weakly K\u00e4hler form on X such that\n\u03c0 \u2217 \u03c9 = d\u03b8\n\n(3.1)\n\nis exact. Clearly, to show that \u03c0V admits no multisections, it suffices to\nprove that \u03c0V\u2217 \u03c9 is exact (see Lemma 1.7, Remark 1.10).\nAveraging \u03b8 over T , we may assume that \u03b8 is T -invariant. Denote by t\nthe Lie algebra of T . For all t \u2208 t,\nd(\u03b8 y t) = Liet \u03b8 \u2212 (d\u03b8) y t = 0.\nTherefore, h\u03b8, ti = \u03b8 y t is constant. Denote by \u03b8\u02c7 \u2208 t\u2217 the corresponding\nform on t.\nSince T is a complex Lie group acting holomorphically, the natural em\u03c1\nbedding1 t \u0592\u2192 T V is C-linear. Therefore, the K\u00e4hler form \u03c9V of V is nondegenerate on \u03c1(t). Since \u03c9V is closed and T -invariant, for all t1 , t2 \u2208 t, the\nfunction \u03c9V (t1 , t2 ) \u2208 C \u221e V is constant (the argument is the same as used\nabove to show that \u03b8 y t is constant). This defines a symplectic form \u03c9V \u02c7 on\nt. Let t\u03b8 \u2208 t be defined by the formula\nh\u03b8\u02c7, ti = \u03c9\u02c7(t\u03b8 , t).\n1\n\nThis map is an embedding, because the stabilizer St(v) is finite everywhere. This is\nthe only place we use this assumption in the whole argument.\n\n18\n\n\fPositive toric fibrations\n\nM. Verbitsky, March 6, 2007\n\nDenote by \u03b8V the 1-form \u03c9(t\u03b8 , *) on V . By Cartan's formula, \u03b8V is closed.\nMoreover,\nh\u03b8V , ti = \u03b8\u02c7(t) = h\u03b8, ti\n(3.2)\nfor all t \u2208 t.\nConsider the projection maps\n\nM\nand let \u03a8 :=\n\n\u03c01\u2217 \u03b8\n\n\u2212\n\n\u03c02\u2217 \u03b8V\n\nM \u00d7 ?V\n?\n\n\u007f\n\u007f\u007f\n\u007f\n\u007f\n\u007f\u007f\n\u007f\u007f \u007f\n\u03c01\n\n?? \u03c0\n?? 2\n??\n?\u001f\n\nV\n\n. Since \u03b8V is closed, (3.1) gives\nd\u03a8 = \u03c01\u2217 \u03c0 \u2217 \u03c9.\n\n(3.3)\n\nBy construction, \u03a8 is T -invariant; from (3.2), we obtain that h\u03a8, ti = 0\nfor all t \u2208 t, with T acting on M \u00d7 V diagonally. From T -invariance and\nh\u03a8, ti = 0 it follows that \u03a8 is a pullback of a form \u03c8 on (M \u00d7 V )/T = MV .\nNow, (3.3) implies that \u03c0V\u2217 \u03c9 = d\u03c8. We proved that \u03c0V\u2217 \u03c9 is exact. This\nfinishes the proof of Lemma 3.9 and Theorem 3.8.\n\n4\n\nRelative Douady spaces\n\nUsing Theorem 3.8, we can prove Theorem 1.13 as follows.\n\u03c0\nLet M \u2212\u2192 X be a Q-positive toric fibration, and Z \u2282 M an irreducible\ncomplex subvariety, which does not lie in a fiber of \u03c0. Denote by X1 the reso\u03c01\nlution of singularities of \u03c0(Z), and let M1 := X1 \u00d7\u03c0(Z) \u03c0 \u22121 (\u03c0(Z)) \u2212\u2192\nX1 be\nthe corresponding principal toric fibration, and Z1 be the proper preimage\nof Z in M1 . Clearly, \u03c01 is a weakly Q-positive fibration (see Remark 1.17).\nWe have reduced Theorem 1.13 to the following statement.\n\u03c0\n\nProposition 4.1: Let M \u2212\u2192 X be a principal toric bundle, dim X > 0,\nand Z \u2282 M an irreducible complex subvariety. Assume that \u03c0 is weakly\nQ-positive, and \u03c0(Z) = X. Then Z = M .\nProof: Let X be a complex variety, Y \u2282 X a compact subvariety. In\nthis situation, a space of deformations of Y inside X is defined, called the\nDouady space ([Do], [F2]).1 Denote by DY the component of the Douady\n1\n\nThere are actually two different definitions of the moduli of deformations of subvarieties, the Douady space and the Barlet space, [Ba]. They are bimeromorphically\nequivalent. For our purposes any of these two can serve.\n\n19\n\n\fPositive toric fibrations\n\nM. Verbitsky, March 6, 2007\n\nspace containing Y . In [F3], A. Fujiki proved that if X is a compact manifold\nof Fujiki class C, same is true for DY .\nLet D be a Douady space of subvarieties in T , equpped with a natural T action, and D\u03c0 := MD the associated fiber bundle. We call D\u03c0 the relative\n\u03c0\nDouady space of M \u2212\u2192 X. It is a classifying space of subvarieties of\nthe fibers of \u03c0.\nFor x \u2208 X, let Zx := \u03c0 \u22121 (x) \u2229 Z be the subvariety of a torus \u03c0 \u22121 (x)\ncorresponding to x. This gives a multisection X \u2032 \u2282 D\u03c0 , where D\u03c0 is the\nrelative Douady space. Applying Theorem 3.8, we find that any multisection\nof D\u03c0 is T -invariant. This means that Zx \u2282 \u03c0 \u22121 (x) is T -invariant. However,\nthe only T -invariant subvariety of a torus T is T . Therefore, Z = M .\n\nAcknowledgements: I am grateful to J.-P.
