INTRODUCTION\n\nSpatial confinements of systems undergoing continuous phase transitions perturb the fluctuation spectrum of the\ncorresponding ordering degrees of freedom. This leads to a dependence of the free energy of the systems on the\ndistance between the confining walls which can be expressed in terms of universal scaling function. Their gradient\nrenders the so-called critical Casimir forces which are the analogues of the well known electro-magnetic Casimir or\ndispersion forces.\nRecent developments in the theory of Casimir forces in critical and correlated fluids [1] have provided a strong motivation for testing them experimentally in various systems. Capacity studies of 4 He wetting films near the superfluid\ntransition T\u03bb [2] have confirmed the existence of the critical Casimir effect and for temperatures T > T\u03bb quantitative\nagreement with corresponding theoretical predictions has been found [3\u20135]. Similar effects have been observed for wetting films of binary liquid mixtures near the critical end-point of their demixing transition [6]. Additional evidence for\nthe critical Casimir force and detailed data have been reported for wetting films at solid substrates of 3 He-4 He mixtures\nnear their tricritical point [7,8]. These latter experiments have also raised new interesting challenges for the theory,\nwhich have motivated the present work. Among them is the sign and the amplitude of the Casimir force or, more\ngenerally, the form of its scaling function for different values of the concentration of 3 He atoms. Theory predicts that\nthese features of the Casimir force crucially depend on the type of boundary conditions which the confining surfaces\nimpose on the order parameter [1]. For example, the force should be attractive for symmetric boundary conditions\nand repulsive for nonsymmetric boundary conditions. The distinction between the surface universality classes is also\nrelevant. In the case of pure 4 He films near the \u03bb-point the boundary conditions at the two confining interfaces of the\nwetting layer seem to be very well approximated by symmetric Dirichlet boundary conditions forming the so-called\nordinary surface universality class, because the quantum-mechanical wave function that describes the superfluid state\nvanishes at both interfaces [1,2]. For films of 3 He-4 He mixture the situation is less clear. In these systems a 4 He-rich\nlayer forms near the substrate-fluid interface, which may become superfluid already above the \u03bb-line [9\u201311], whereas\nthere is an enrichment of 3 He near the opposing fluid-vapor interface. Thus the two interfaces impose a nontrivial\nconcentration profile, which in turn couples to the superfluid order parameter. The experiment of Ref. [7] reports\na repulsive Casimir force at the tricritical point but it is not immediately obvious that the concentration profile\ninduces effectively nonsymmetric boundary conditions for the superfluid order parameter, i.e., symmetry-breaking\n1\n\n\fboundary conditions at the substrate-fluid interface (also known as the so-called extraordinary or normal universality\nclass) and Dirichlet boundary conditions at the fluid-vapor interface. The superfluid order parameter possesses a\ncontinuous O(2) symmetry so that if the layer is effectively two-dimensional it is in the Kosterlitz-Thouless phase\nwith the superfluid order-parameter equal to zero [12]. On the other hand, upon approaching the \u03bb-line from the\nhigh temperature side the superfluid layer thickens due to the increase of the correlation length and a dimensional\ncrossover to a three-dimensional superfluid phase with non-zero order-parameter should take place [13]. In order to\nbe able to interpret and to understand the features of the Casimir force and other surface and finite-size effects in\n3\nHe-4 He mixture films near the tricritical point systematic studies of a model system are needed. Due to the universal\ncharacter of the critical Casimir force it is sufficient to choose as a model system one which belongs to the same\nuniversality class as the actual physical system. The prerequisite of such future studies is a detailed analysis of the\nbulk properties of such a suitable model. This is the purpose of the present paper. The model should resemble the\nmain features of the bulk phase diagram of 3 He-4 He mixtures in three dimensions (d = 3) and take into account the\ncontinuous rotational O(2) symmetry of the superfluid degrees of freedom of 4 He.\nThe general features of phase separation and superfluidity in three-dimensional mixtures of liquid 3 He and 4 He\nare well known from experiments [14]. In pure 4 He there is a transition from a normal fluid to a superfluid phase\ncharacterized by a complex order parameter. If 4 He is diluted with 3 He, the superfluid transition temperature is\ndepressed. Simultaneously, the tendency toward phase separation increases and at a critical 3 He concentration the\nmixture undergoes a first-order phase transition into a 4 He-rich and a 3 He-rich phase, of which only the 4 He-rich\nphase is superfluid. In the temperature - 3 He concentration plane (T, x) the line of second-order superfluid transitions\nTs (x) meets the boundary of the two-phase coexistence region at the tricritical point (Tt \u2248 87mK, xt \u2248 0.67);\nx = N3 /(N3 + N4 ), where Ni , i = 3, 4, denotes the number of atoms of 3 He or 4 He, respectively.\nIn this paper we consider a simple lattice model known in the literature as the Vectoralized Blume-Emery-Griffiths\nmodel (VBEG) [15,16]. It is defined in Sec. II. The bulk phase diagram of the VBEG model was investigated\nonly in spatial dimensions d = 2 by means of Migdal-Kadanoff recursion relations [15,16]; no tricritical point was\nfound for any value of the model parameters. Here we study the three-dimensional version of this model within the\nmolecular-field approximation and by Monte Carlo simulations, and we demonstrate that for reasonable values of\ninteraction parameters the resulting phase diagram resembles topologically that observed experimentally for three\ndimensional mixtures, for which the phase separation appears as a consequence of the superfluid ordering. This is\ncarried out in Sec. III and Sec. IV, respectively. In Sec. VI we derive a two-parameter continuous Landau-Ginzburg\n(GL) model describing bulk 3 He-4 He mixtures near a tricritical point starting from the modified VBEG model. The\nGL approach has many advantages and it is worthwhile to have a LG model with coupling constants explicitely related\nto the measured quantities, such like like temperature, superfluid density, concentration of 3 He atoms, or parameters\ndescribing interactions. We close our paper with a summary and conclusions.\nII. THE MODEL.\n\nWe consider a simple lattice model of 3 He-4 He mixtures which takes into account the continuous rotational O(2)\nsymmetry of the superfluid degrees of freedom of 4 He. It is a vectorial generalization of the spin-1 model used by\nBlume, Emery, and Griffiths (BEG) [17] for describing the \u03bb-line and the tricritical point in 3 He-4 He mixtures. In\nthis model each simple cubic lattice site i is associated with an occupation variable ti , taking the values 0 or 1, and a\nphase \u03b8i (0 \u2264 \u03b8i < 2\u03c0) which mimics the phase of the 4 He wave function. A 3 He atom at site i corresponds to ti = 0\nand a 4 He atom to ti = 1. Since the model in this reduced version does not allow for unoccupied sites, the model\ndoes not exhibit a vapor phase. (In future studies the model can be generalized to incorporate the vapor phase; here\nit is left out for reasons of simplicity.) \u03b8i reflects the superfluid degrees of freedom. The model Hamiltonian consists\nof a lattice gas part describing a binary mixture and a term responsible for the \"superfluid\" ordering. Since only 4 He\natoms couple to the superfluid order parameter the Hamiltonian is taken as\nX\nX\nX\nti\n(2.1)\nti tj + \u2206\nti tj cos(\u03b8i \u2212 \u03b8j ) \u2212 K\nH = \u2212J\n<ij>\n\n<ij>\n\ni\n\nwhere the first two sums are over nearest-neighbor pairs < ij >, and the last sum is over all lattice sites. The lattice\nconstant a is taken to be equal to 1.\nIn the lattice gas model of the 3 He-4 He binary mixture the coupling constant K and the field \u2206 are related to the\neffective \u03b1 He-\u03b2 He interactions -K\u03b1\u03b2 [18]\nK = K33 + K44 \u2212 2K34 ,\nand to the chemical potentials \u03bc3 and \u03bc4 of 3 He and 4 He, repectively,\n2\n\n(2.2)\n\n\f\u2206 = \u03bc3 \u2212 \u03bc4 + 2z(K33 \u2212 K34 ),\n\n(2.3)\n\nwhere z is the coordination number of the lattice (z = 2d, where d is the spatial dimension of the system; z = 6 in\nthe present case).\nIn the liquid the effective interactions K\u03b1\u03b2 are different for different \u03b1 and \u03b2 due to the differences of mass and\nstatistics between 3 He and 4 He atoms. The coupling constant J is related [16,21] to a bare, superfluid density \u03c10 (T )\nby\nJ = h\u03042 \u03c10 (T )a(d\u22122) /m2\n\n(2.4)\n\nwhere m is the mass of a 4 He atom. a is the mean interparticle spacing (the lattice parameter in the lattice model).\nThe superfluid density can be measured from the velocity of third sound and from the response of a torsional oscillator\n[19]; it has units of mass per unit volume (or area in two dimensions). Here we are concerned only with the case J > 0\nand K > 0.\nWhen all occupation numbers ti are equal to 1, up to constants the first term in Eq.(2.1) corresponds to the classical\nXY model (the planar rotator model) for pure 4 He. Therefore, in the limit of \u2206 \u2192 \u2212\u221e the partition function of the\nmodel reduces to that of XY model up to a factor eKzN where N is the number of lattice sites.\nThe model as defined above is known in the literature as the Vectoralized Blume-Emery-Griffiths model (VBEG).\nIt was first proposed by Berker and Nelson [16] and, independently, by Cardy and Scalpino [15] to describe thin films\nof 3 He-4 He mixtures, for which the mechanism of the superfluid transition is different from that in d = 3; there is no\nspontaneous breaking of the continuous symmetry in d = 2 [20], i.e., the order parameter does not become nonzero\nbelow the transition temperature. The superfluid transition in films of 3 He-4 He mixtures is of the Kosterlitz-Thouless\ntype [12].\nIn d = 2 the phase diagram of the VBEG model was obtained by means of the Migdal-Kadanoff renormalizationgroup method [15,16]. Its features are qualitatively similar to those observed experimentally for the corresponding\nthree-dimensional mixtures, except that there is no true tricritical point for any value of the model parameters.\nThe line of the superfluid transitions (\u03bb-line) is connected to the phase-separation curve by a critical endpoint at a\ntemperature distinctly lower than the phase-separation critical temperature. Thus upon lowering the temperature\nthe system first phase separates into two normal fluids with different concentrations of 3 He. At lower temperatures,\nthere is phase separation into a superfluid phase with a low 3 He concentration and into a normal fluid with a high\n3\nHe concentration.\nIn this paper we are interested in the corresponding three-dimensional systems. We determine the phase diagram\nof the VBEG model within mean-field approximation and by Monte Carlo simulations.\nIII. MOLECULAR FIELD APPROXIMATION\nA. Free energy\n\nIn this section we determine the phase diagram of the VBEG model whithin the molecular-field approximation. It\nis derived from the variational method based upon approximating the total equilibrium density matrix by a product\nof local site density matrices \u03c1i [21].\nThe variation theorem for the free energy reads:\nF \u2264 F\u03c1 = T r(\u03c1H) + (1/\u03b2)T r(\u03c1 ln \u03c1)\n\n(3.1)\n\nwhere F is the exact free energy and F\u03c1 is an approximate free energy associated with the density matrix \u03c1; \u03b2 = 1/kB T .\nThe minimum of F\u03c1 with respect to the variation of \u03c1 subject to the constraint T r\u03c1 = 1 is attained for the equilibrium\ndensity matrix, \u03c1 = e\u2212\u03b2H /T r(e\u2212\u03b2H ).\nWhithin mean-field theory the density matrix is approximated by\n\u03c1 = \u03c10 =\n\nN\nY\n\n\u03c1i\n\n(3.2)\n\ni=1\n\nwhere in homogeneous bulk systems the local density matrix \u03c1i is independent of the site i. For the Hamiltonian\ngiven by Eq.(2.1) the variational mean-field free energy per site is\n\n3\n\n\f\u0003\nK\u0303\nJ \u0303 \u0002\n\u03a6\nF\u03c10\n\u2261\n= \u2212 (T r(ti \u03c1i ))2 \u2212\n(T r(ti cos \u03b8i \u03c1i ))2 + (T r(ti sin \u03b8i \u03c1i ))2\nN\nN\n2\n2\n+ \u2206T r(ti \u03c1i ) + (1/\u03b2)T r(\u03c1i ln \u03c1i )\n\n(3.3)\n\nwhere K\u0303 = zK and J \u0303 = zJ. To determine variational minima to Eq.(3.3) we treat the local site density \u03c1i as a\nvariational function, and the best functional form in terms of ti and \u03b8i is obtain by minimizing F\u03c10 with respect to\n\u03c1i . In this procedure, however, the connection between F\u03c10 and the Hemholtz free energy functional of the order\nparameters is not straightforward [22]. Minimizing \u03a6/N + \u03b7T r(\u03c1i ) with respect to \u03c1i and with \u03b7 as a Lagrange\nmultiplier one obtains\n\u03c1i = e\u2212\u03b2hi /T r(e\u2212\u03b2hi )\n\n(3.4)\n\nwhere hi is the single-site molecular Hamiltonian given by\nhi = \u2212K\u0303(T r(ti \u03c1i ))ti \u2212 J \u0303 [(T r(ti cos \u03b8i ))ti cos \u03b8i + (T r(ti sin \u03b8i ))ti sin \u03b8i ] + \u2206ti .\n\n(3.5)\n\nWe define the following order parameters:\nQ \u2261 1 \u2212 x =< ti >\n\n(3.6)\n\nand\nMx =< ti cos \u03b8i >\n\nMy =< ti sin \u03b8i > .\n\n(3.7)\n\nQ corresponds to the concentration of 4 He, x to the concentration ofq3 He, and Mx , My are the components of the two-\n\ndimensional superfluid order parameter M = (M1 , M2 ) with M =\n\nMx2 + My2 . Within this approximation Q(\u2206, T )\n\nand M (\u2206, T ) are given by two coupled self-consistent equations:\nQ=\n\nI0 (\u03b2 J \u0303M )\ne\u03b2(\u2212K\u0303Q+\u2206)\n\n+ I0 (\u03b2 J \u0303M )\n\n(3.8)\n\nand\nM=\n\nI1 (\u03b2 J \u0303M )\n+ I0 (\u03b2 J \u0303M )\n\ne\u03b2(\u2212K\u0303Q+\u2206)\n\n(3.9)\n\nwhere I0 (z) and I1 (z) are modified Bessel functions [23].\nThe equilibrium free energy \u03a6(\u2206, T ) is given by\n\u03a6(\u2206, T )/N =\n\nK\u0303\nJ \u0303\n((Q(\u2206, T ))2 + (M (\u2206, T ))2 + (1/\u03b2) ln(1 \u2212 Q(\u2206, T )).\n2\n2\n\n(3.10)\n\nMost parts of the phase diagram can only be determined by solving the equations for Q and M numerically. Some\nregions, however, can be studied analytically.\nB. \u03bb-line and tricritical point\n\nIn order to find the line of critical points on which second-order transitions from the normal (M = 0) to the the\nsuperfluid (M 6= 0) state take place, one needs the thermodynamic potential in terms of the order parameter M ,\nA(M, \u2206, T ) = \u03a6 \u2212 M H,\n\n(3.11)\n\nwhere H is a field conjugate to M :\nH =\u2212\n\n\u2202A\n.\n\u2202M\n\nThe conditions for the critical points are:\n4\n\n(3.12)\n\n\f\u22023H\n> 0,\n\u2202M 3\n\n\u22022H\n\u2202H\n= 0,\n=\n\u2202M\n\u2202M 2\n\n(3.13)\n\nand the tricritical point is determined by\n\u22023H\n\u22024H\n\u2202H\n\u2202 2H\n=\n=\n= 0,\n=\n\u2202M\n\u2202M 2\n\u2202M 3\n\u2202M 4\n\n\u22025H\n> 0.\n\u2202M 5\n\n(3.14)\n\nTo find H as a function of M we use the analogue of Eq.(3.9) for H 6= 0:\nM=\n\nI1 (\u03b2 J \u0303M + \u03b2H)\n.\n \u0303 + \u03b2H)\ne\u03b2(\u2212K\u0303Q+\u2206) + I0 (\u03b2 JM\n\n(3.15)\n\nSince this equation cannot be inverted explicitly, we expand it around H = 0 keeping only terms linear in H, and find\n\u03b2H =\n\n \u0303 ) + M e\u03b2(\u2212K\u0303Q+\u2206)\nI1 (\u03b2 J \u0303M ) \u2212 M I0 (\u03b2 JM\n.\n \u0303 ) \u2212 (1/2)(I0 (\u03b2 JM\n \u0303 ) \u2212 I2 (\u03b2 JM\n \u0303 ))\nM I1 (\u03b2 JM\n\n(3.16)\n\nApplying the conditions formulated in Eq.(3.13)-(3.16) yields the whole line of critical points, i.e., the \u03bb-line Ts (x):\nTs (x) =\n\n \u0303 \u2212 x)\n \u0303\nJ(1\nJQ\n=\n.\n2\n2\n\n(3.17)\n\n \u0303\nIt follows that, as the concentration of 3 He increases from zero, Ts decreases linearly from Ts (0) = J/2.\nThe critical\ncurve \u2206 = \u2206s (T ) in the (\u2206, T ) plane can be obtained by first solving Eq.(3.8) for \u2206 (here and in the following we\ninclude kB into T ) which gives\n \u0303 ),\n\u2206(Q, T ) = T ln(1 \u2212 Q) \u2212 T ln Q + K\u0303Q + T ln I0 (JM\n\n(3.18)\n\nand then evaluate Eq.(3.18) for M = 0 and Q = 2T /J \u0303 (see Eqs.(3.6) and (3.17)).\nThe line of second-order phase transitions ends at the tricritical point (Tt , xt ) where the transition changes to a\nfirst-order one. From Eqs. (3.14) and (3.16) one obtains for the temperature Tt\nTt /Ts (0) =\n\n1 + 2K/J\n2 + 2K/J\n\n(3.19)\n\nand for the concentration xt\nTt /Ts (0) = 1 \u2212 xt ,\n\n(3.20)\n\nprovided \u2202 5 H/\u2202M 5 > 0 holds for the chosen value of K/J. It is possible that not all critical points on this so-called\ncritical line represent equilibrium phase transitions because the latter ones are preempted by first-order demixing\ntransitions. Thus it can be that only a portion of this so-called critical line gives the \u03bb-line, the rest being metastable.\nC. Demixing\n\nFor the disordered phase with M = 0 one can easily find the first-order phase separation line from the 3 He-rich\n'normal' fluid to the 4 He-rich 'normal' fluid. The phase separation is associated with an instability loop including a\nrange of Q values for which \u2202\u2206/\u2202Q > 0 and the critical point is given by \u2202\u2206/\u2202Q = \u2202 2 \u2206/\u2202Q2 = 0. These last two\nrelations together with Eq.(3.18), evaluated at M = 0, are satisfied if Qc = 1/2 and Tc = K\u0303/4. The critical value \u2206c\nof \u2206 is K\u0303/2. Inserting \u2206 = \u2206c and M = 0 into Eq.(3.18) gives\nT ln\n\n1\u2212Q\n\u2212 (1/2)K\u0303(2Q \u2212 1) = 0\nQ\n\n(3.21)\n\nFor T < K\u0303/4 this equation has pairs of solution (Q, 1 \u2212 Q). For M = 0, i.e., above the critical line in the (Q, T )\nplane, these solution form the coexistence curve which is symmetric about Q = 1/2 or x = 0.5. For temperatures\nlower than the intersection temperature TI of the critical line with the curve given by Eq.(3.21) the phase rich in 4 He\nbecomes superfluid and Eq.(3.21) no longer represents the coexistence curve.\n5\n\n\fIn order to find what types of phase diagrams the present model provides we look for the phase-separation instability\non the critical curve as determined in Subsec. III B and how it is located with respect to the intersection point\nPI = (QI , TI ). Depending on the ratio K/J there are three possibilities which give three different types of the phase\ndiagram: (i) the instability point Pt lies below the intersection point PI , (ii) Pt lies above PI , and (iii) the critical\npoint of the transition between 3 He- and 4 He-rich 'normal' fluids falls into the instability range initiated at Pt .\nA sufficient condition for an instability loop leading to phase separation is \u2202\u2206/\u2202Q > 0. Using Eq.(3.18) and the\nrelation Q = M I0 (\u03b2 J \u0303M )/I1 (\u03b2 J \u0303M ) one finds\n\u0012\n\n\u2202\u2206\n\u2202Q\n\n\u0013\n\n=\n\nQ=Q\u2217 +\n\n\u2212J \u0303\n+ K\u0303 + J \u0303\n2(1 \u2212 Q\u2217 )\n\n(3.22)\n\n\u2212J \u0303\n+ K\u0303,\n2(1 \u2212 Q\u2217 )\n\n(3.23)\n\nwhereas\n\u0012\n\n\u2202\u2206\n\u2202Q\n\n\u0013\n\n=\nQ=Q\u2217 \u2212\n\nwhere Q\u2217 is the critical value of Q for superfluid ordering given by Eq. (3.17). Thus (\u2202\u2206/\u2202Q)Q=Q\u2217 \u2212 >\n(\u2202\u2206/\u2202Q)Q=Q\u2217 + and the instability will occur on the ordered side of the critical curve when (\u2202\u2206/\u2202Q)Q=Q\u2217 + = 0.\nFrom Eq. (3.22) the coordinates of the instability point Pt are given by Eq. (3.19), i.e., they are exactly the same as\nas those of the tricritical point. We find numerically that PI and Pt = (Qt , Tt ) coincide for K/J \u2248 2.01681.\nFor K/J > 2.01681 case (i) is realized, i.e., the instability point Pt lies inside the coexistence curve between\nthe 3 He-rich 'normal' fluid and the 4 He-rich 'normal' fluid. We have obtained numerically the phase diagram for\nK/J = 2.4. It is shown in Figs. 1(a) and 1(b) in the (\u2206, T ) and (x, T ) plane, respectively. The dashed line in the\n(\u2206, T ) plane represents the line of equilibrium second-order phase transitions on the critical curve and thus represents\nthe \u03bb-line. This line terminates at the phase separation curve (solid line) at the critical end point E. CE is the line of\nthe first-order phase transitions between the 3 He-rich and the 4 He-rich 'normal' fluids with the critical point C. At the\npoint E the curve CE turns into the line of first-order phase transitions between the 3 He-rich 'normal' fluid and the\n4\nHe-rich superfluid. The phase boundary \u2206(T ) between the 3 He-rich and the 4 He-rich 'normal' fluid or the 4 He-rich\nsuperfluid (represented by a solid line) is expected to exhibit a singular curvature \u223c |T \u2212 TE |\u2212\u03b1 as T approaches the\nend point temperature from above or below [24]. \u03b1 is the critical exponent describing the specific heat singularity\non the critical line below the point E. Since in mean-field theory \u03b1 = 0, there is no nonanalyticity at the end point\nwhithin the present approach. In the (x, T ) plane (see Fig. 1(b)) the coexistence curve is smooth at T = TE on the\n3\nHe-rich side.\nFor K/J < 2.01681 the instability point Pt lies outside the coexistence curve for the 3 He-rich 'normal' fluid and\nthe 4 He-rich 'normal' fluid. Therefore, as T decreases below Tt , the phase separation between the 3 He-rich 'normal'\nfluid and the 4 He-rich superfluid commences at the point Pt on the critical curve; hence Pt \u2261 A is a tricritical point.\nThe phase diagram for K/J = 1.8 is shown in Fig. 2. In the (\u2206, T ) plane (Fig. 2(a)) the first-order transition line\nbetween the 3 He-rich 'normal' fluid and the 4 He-rich superfluid which starts at A terminates at a triple point D where\nit meets the first-order transition lines between the 3 He-rich 'normal' fluid and the 4 He-rich 'normal' fluid (curve CD)\nand between the 3 He-rich 'normal' fluid and the 4 He-rich superfluid.\nFor even smaller value of the ratio K/J there are no longer two distinguishable disordered phases, i.e., the line\nDC in Fig. 2(a) has shrunk to zero. The critical point for coexistence between the 3 He-rich 'normal' fluid and the\n4\nHe-rich 'normal' fluid, which occurs at xc = 1/2 and Tc = K\u0303/4, disappears. In Fig. 3 we present the phase diagram\nfor K/J = 1. In the (\u2206, T ) plane it exhibits a very simple form (Fig. 3(a)). The \u03bb-line meets the first-order transition\nline between the 3 He-rich 'normal' fluid and the 4 He-rich superfluid at the tricritical point A. The lines meet with\na common tangent, a feature characteristic of the mean-field approximation. In the (x, T ) plane (Fig. 3(b)) at the\ntricritical point the critical line Ts (x) has the same slope as the phase-separation curve on the 3 He-rich side. The\nemergence of the type of phase diagram shown in Fig. 3 from the one shown in Fig. 2 takes place at that value\nof K/J for which there is an equilibrium between the phase at the critical point C and an ordered phase yielding\nK/J \u2248 1.4298. For K/J slightly less than this value K/J = 1.4298, the tricritical point is located at Tt \u2248 0.397 and\n<\nxt \u2248 0.206. Whithin mean-field theory the 3 He-rich side of the coexistence curve has a plateau for 0.8 <\n\u223c x \u223c 0.3,\ni.e., right below the tricritical point small changes in temperature lead to pronounced changes in the concentration\nof 3 He. As K/J is reduced further the tricritical point shifts to larger values of x and smaller values of T . Also the\nshape of the coexistence curve changes; the plateau disappears and the concentration of 3 He inceases more uniformly\nwith the temperature.\nA phase diagram like that of Fig. 3 resembles qualitatively the experimental one [14], for which one finds for the\ntricritical point TA /Ts (0) = 0.4 and xA = 0.669. In our model xA is, however, always smaller than 0.5.\n\n6\n\n\fIV. MONTE CARLO SIMULATIONS\n\nFor the Monte Carlo treatment of the model Hamiltonian given by Eq.(2.1) a 4 He atom is represented by the\nnormalized spin vector\nSi \u2261 (cos \u03b8i , sin \u03b8i )\n\n(4.1)\n\nfor each lattice site i in the spirit of the standard XY model. A 3 He atom on lattice site i is represented as Si \u2261 (0, 0).\nConsequently the occupation number ti on lattice site i is given by ti = |Si | and the interaction cos(\u03b8i \u2212 \u03b8j ) between\ntwo 4 He atoms is given by the computationally more favorable scalar product cos(\u03b8i \u2212 \u03b8j ) = Si * Sj . The lattice is\nsimple cubic with periodic boundary conditions and L lattice sites in each direction. The Monte Carlo algorithm is\nbased on various standard procedures which we discuss briefly in the following.\nIn order to explore the phase space of the model, two types of updates are needed: (i) spin flip updates and\n(ii) particle insertion and deletion updates. The spin flip updates are responsible for the creation of long - ranged\nmagnetic order which in our model represents the normal - superfluid transition. This can be of first or second order\ndepending on the concentration x = 1\u2212 < ti > of 3 He (ti = 0) in the system (see Fig. 3). The particle insertion and\ndeletion updates are responsible for the demixing transition (phase separation) in our model. This transition can also\nbe first or second order depending on the coupling constants in the model (see Figs. 1 and 2). In our simulation we\nare primarily interested in that regime of coupling constants, for which the phase diagram resembles that of actual\n3\nHe -4 He mixtures (Fig. 3) and therefore the possibility of a second order (critical) demixing transition is not taken\ninto account for the selection of the Monte Carlo moves. We therefore use the following methods in our Monte Carlo\nsimulation: (i) single particle insertion and deletion and (ii) single spin flip according to the Metropolis algorithm [25],\n(iii) single cluster spin flip according to the Wolff algorithm [26], and (iv) overrelaxation updates of the spin degrees\nof freedom at constant configurational energy [27]. For each particle insertion or single spin flip move the new spin\nstate is randomly selected from the even distribution on the unit circle. The projection vector for the embedding part\nof the Wolff algorithm [26] is also chosen randomly from the even distribution on the unit circle.\nThe above update methods are performed in sweeps over the whole lattice, where each spin flip sweep (ii), (iii), or\n(iv) is preceded by a Metropolis particle insertion and deletion sweep (i). Cluster updates of the particle configuration\naccording to the embedding algorithm of Ref. [26] are disregarded, because the critical demixing transition will not\nbe explored here.\nThe three basic Monte Carlo updates (ii) - (iv) outlined above are combined according to the hybrid Monte Carlo\nidea [28] to ensure efficient configuration space exploration also for second order (critical) transitions to long-ranged\nmagnetic order. One hybrid Monte Carlo step consists of 10 individual steps each of which can be one of the updates\nlisted above. The Metropolis and the Wolff algorithm work the standard way, in which the acceptance probability p\nof a proposed spin flip in the Metropolis algorithm is defined by the local heat bath rule\np(\u2206E) = 1/[exp(\u2206E/kB T ) + 1],\n\n(4.2)\n\nwhere \u2206E is the change in configurational energy of the proposed move. The overrelaxation part of the algorithm\nperforms a microcanonical update of the configuration by sequentially reflecting each spin in the lattice at the direction\nof the local field, i.e., the sum of the nearest neighbor spins, such that its contribution to the energy of the whole\nconfiguration remains constant. The implementation of this update scheme is straightforward, because according to\nEq.(2.1) the energy of a spin with respect to its neighborhood has the functional form of a scalar product. The form\nhybrid Monte Carlo step depends on the region of the phase diagram to be explored. In the vicinity of the first-order\nphase separation line typically six Metropolis (M), one single cluster Wolff (C), and three overrelaxation (O) updates\nare performed. The individual updates are mixed automatically in the program to generate the update sequence M\nM O M O M M O M C for the magnetic degrees of freedom.\nThe random number generator is the shift register generator R1279 defined by the recursion relation Xn = Xn\u2212p \u2295\nXn\u2212q for (p, q) = (1279, 1063). Generators like these are known to cause systematic errors in combination with the\nWolff algorithm [29]. However, for lags (p, q) used here these errors are far smaller than typical statistical errors.\nThey are further reduced by the hybrid nature of the algorithm [28].\nThe hybrid algorithm is well suited to explore second-order phase transitions. However, it is unable to overcome the\nexponential slowing down of the algorithms included in our hybrid scheme in the vicinity of a first-order transition,\ne.g., the first-order magnetic (i.e., superfluid) transition for higher concentrations of 3 He particles, i.e., for occupation\nnumbers ti = 0 in our model. In order to resolve this problem while keeping the benefits of the hybrid scheme we have\nembedded the hybrid Monte Carlo method in a simulated tempering environment [30]. According to the simulated\ntempering idea the temperature is treated as a random variable which performs a random walk inside a predefined\ntemperature interval. In our simulation this temperature interval is represented by a discrete set of temperatures,\n7\n\n\fwhich are spaced closely enough to allow sufficient overlap of the corresponding energy distribution functions. The\nrequired reweighting factors [30] are estimated from short runs, one for each pair of neighboring temperatures, and\nchecked a posteriori by monitoring the probability distribution of the temperatures - which should be essentially flat\n\u2013 during the production run. Deviations of up to 20% from a flat temperature distribution are tolerated.\nThe Monte Carlo scheme described above is employed for lattice sizes L between L = 12 and L = 60. For\neach choice of parameters we have performed at least 12 blocks of 103 hybrid steps for equilibration followed by\nanother 103 hybrid steps to estimate the reweighting factors for each pair of neighboring temperatures and finally\nfollowed by 4 \u00d7 104 hybrid steps for measurements. The measurement block is controlled by an outer loop in which\na new temperature is proposed according to the predetermined weight factors [30] after each hybrid Monte Carlo\nstep. Apart from standard thermodynamic quantities the distribution functions of the total energy, the density,\nand the modulus of the magnetization are monitored using histogram reweighting and extrapolation techniques [31]\nwithin the measurement block. Their statistical errors are estimated following standard procedures resulting from\nthe statistical independence of different measurement blocks. Unless otherwise stated all error bars quoted in the\nfollowing correspond to one standard deviation. They are displayed only when they exceed the symbol sizes. The\nsimulations have been performed on DEC Alpha Workstations and Pentium III PCs.\nV. MONTE CARLO RESULTS\n\nOur primary interest in this study is to use Eq. (2.1) to model 3 He-4 He mixtures in the tricritical region and we\ntherefore restrict the numerical investigation of the statistical model described by Eq. (2.1) to the case J = K for\nwhich the phase diagram corresponding to this model Hamiltonian has the same topology as for the liquid phases of\n3\nHe-4 He mixtures. The tricritical point marks the onset of demixing into a spin (4 He) rich fluid and a vacancy (3 He)\nrich fluid, where the spin rich fluid simultanously exhibits long-ranged magnetic order of the XY type (superfluidity).\nThe phase diagram is most conveniently investigated by the inspection of distribution functions (histograms) for\nvarious thermodynamic quantities [32]. However, the computational expense of the method described in Ref. [32]\nin d = 2 is prohibitive in d = 3 for any appreciable system sizes. We therefore resort to a simpler though less\naccurate approach which allows us to treat larger systems and is accurate enough for our purposes. In the following\nall temperatures are measured in units of the critical temperature Ts (0) of the XY model on a simple cubic lattice in\nd = 3, which is given by Kc \u2261 J/(kB Ts (0)) = 0.45415(5) [33]. The chemical potential \u2206 is measured in units of the\nmagnetic coupling contsant J (see Eq. (2.1)).\nA. Order parameter distribution at tricriticality\n\nThe key feature of the 3 He-4 He phase diagram is the presence of a tricritical point. The task to locate the tricritical\npoint for the model Hamiltonian given by Eq. (2.1) is aided by the observation that d = 3 is the upper critical\ndimension for tricriticality. It is therefore reasonable to assume that the distribution function of the magnetic order\nparameter essentially takes the mean-field (Landau) form. We will give some a posteriori evidence below that this\nassumption is indeed correct, but an accurate numerical proof of it is beyond the scope of this paper.\nThe magnetic order parameter, i.e., the magnetization is defined by\nX\nti Si ,\n(5.1)\nM = (Mx , My ) \u2261 L\u22123\ni\n\nwhere ti = 0, 1 characterizes the presence of 3 He or 4 He at lattice site i and Si = (cos \u03b8i , sin \u03b8i ) is the standard spin\nvariable of the XY model. In terms of the modulus m \u2261 |M| of the order parameter the distribution function P (m)\nis assumed to take the form\nP (m) = P0 m exp(\u2212Am2 \u2212 Bm4 \u2212 Cm6 )\n\n(5.2)\n\naccording to Landau theory in the tricritical region, where the absence of symmetry breaking fields is assumed. The\nparameters A, B, and C essentially play the role of the Landau-Ginzburg model parameters (see Sec. VI below) and\nthey depend on the temperature T and the chemical potential \u2206 (see Eq. (2.1)), where C is manifestly positive, but\nA and B may change sign. For system sizes L = 12, 18, 24, 36, 48 and 60 simulations have been performed along\nvarious paths in the (T, \u2206) plane of the phase diagram and the data recorded for P (m) have been fitted according to\nEq. (5.2) using P0 , A, B, and C as fit parameters. For each system size L a pseudo tricritical point (Tt (L), \u2206t (L)) has\nbeen identified by the requirement A = B = 0 within the corresponding statistical error. It turns out, that Eq. (5.2)\n8\n\n\findeed captures the shape of P (m) rather accurately over several orders of magnitude for P in the pseudo tricritical\nregime (see below). In particular, higher powers of m compatible with the symmetry such as m8 can be safely ignored.\nPossible logarithmic corrections to P (m) [34] could not be identified from the numerical data unambiguously. We will\ncomment on other logarithmic corrections later.\nB. The tricritical point\n\nFrom the procedure outlined above we obtain a sequence of pseudo tricritical points (Tt (L), \u2206t (L)) which can be\nextrapolated to the bulk limit L \u2192 \u221e. In order to do this one has to identify the functional form of the L dependence\nof the pseudo tricritical point. Within our mean-field picture of the tricritical behavior of our model the coefficients\nA and B in Eq. (5.2) are given by the linear combination\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012 \u0013\nT \u2212 Tt\nB\n=M\n(5.3)\n\u2206 \u2212 \u2206t\nA\nin the vicinity of the tricritical point, where M is the coefficient matrix. From Eq. (5.3) and finite-size scaling\narguments one concludes that for sufficiently large L, Tt (L) \u2212 Tt and \u2206t (L) \u2212 \u2206t are governed by a linear combination\nof L\u2212dA and L\u2212dB , where dA and dB are the scaling dimensions of the parameters A and B in Eq. (5.2) given by\ndA = 2 and dB = 1 apart from logarithmic corrections [34]. We therefore arrive at the following functional form of\nTt (L) and \u2206t (L):\nt1\nt2\n+ 2\nL\nL\n\u03b42\n\u03b41\n+ 2,\n\u2206t (L) = \u2206t +\nL\nL\nTt (L) = Tt +\n\n(5.4)\n\nwhere the coefficients t1 , t2 , \u03b41 , and \u03b42 can be obtained from the inverse matrix M\u22121 and the finite-size relations\nA = aL\u22122 and B = bL\u22121\n\n(5.5)\n\nfor A and B evaluated at (T, \u2206) = (Tt (L), \u2206t (L)) for any system size L. The coefficients a and b are nonuniversal\nmetric factors. Eq.(5.4) is used to fit the numerical data for Tt (L) and \u2206t (L) in order to obtain an estimate for the\nlocation of the tricritical point. Logarithmic corrections as given in Ref. [34] can be included in Eq. (5.4), but they\nare omitted here because the quality of fit does not change substantially when they are included. The results are\nshown in Figs. 4 and 5. The finite-size behavior of Tt (L) and \u2206t (L) is accurately captured by Eq. (5.4). Both the\ncoefficients t1 , t2 and \u03b41 , \u03b42 have the same sign and the second coefficient is substantially larger that the first one in\nboth cases. Therefore both coefficients must be kept in order to obtain an acceptable fit. The quality of fit can be\nmeasured in terms of the reduced \u03c72 which is 0.15 in Fig. 4 and 0.42 in Fig. 5. We thus obtain the extrapolated\nvalues\nTt /Ts (0) = 0.7438(4),\n\n\u2206t /J = 3.436(2)\n\n(5.6)\n\nas our estimate for the location of the tricritical point, where the statistical uncertainty affects the last digit by the\namount given in parenthesis. In these units the coefficients in Eq. (5.4) are given by\nt1 /Ts (0) = 0.23 \u00b1 0.02 , t2 /Ts (0) = 1.34 \u00b1 0.24 ,\n\u03b41 /J = \u22121.05 \u00b1 0.11 , \u03b42 /J = \u22128.5 \u00b1 1.4 .\n\n(5.7)\n\nAnother aspect of Eq. (5.4) is field mixing [32], because the finite-size corrections L\u22121 and L\u22122 are uniquely related to\nthe coefficients (scaling fields) B and A in Eq. (5.2), respectively. In the vicinity of the tricritical point one therefore\nobtains from Eqs. (5.3), (5.4), and (5.5) by a matrix inversion\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0012\n\u0013\u0012\n\u0013\n1\nB/b\n\u03b42 \u2212t2\nT \u2212 Tt\n=\n.\n(5.8)\nA/a\n\u2206 \u2212 \u2206t\nt1 \u03b42 \u2212 t2 \u03b41 \u2212\u03b41 t1\nAccording to our mean field picture of tricriticality in d = 3 the coexistence line \u2206 = \u2206(T ) in the vicinity of T = Tt\nshould be associated with the line B = const. = 0 in the vicinity of A = 0. If we linearize the coexistence line near\nthe tricritical point according to\n9\n\n\f\u2206(T ) = \u2206t + \u2206\u2032t (T \u2212 Tt )\n\n(5.9)\n\nwe obtain from Eqs. (5.7) and (5.8) for the slope \u2206\u2032t at the tricritical point\n\u2206\u2032t = \u03b42 /t2 = (6.4 \u00b1 2.2)J/Ts (0).\n\n(5.10)\n\nDespite its large statistical error this result serves as a valuable guideline for the further exploration of the phase\ndiagram.\nThe foundation of the above estimates is the quality of the fits of Eq. (5.2) to the measured order parameter\ndistribution functions. We illustrate the quality of these fits in Fig. 6 for L = 36 at the corresponding pseudo\ntricritical point T = Tt (36) and \u2206 = \u2206t (36). The shape of the distribution function P is essentially captured by Eq.\n(5.2) over more than three orders of magnitude. The parameters A and B vanish within their statistical errors. The\nreduced \u03c72 of the fit is 0.71. If A = B = 0 is enforced, i.e, the fit is performed only with the parameters P0 and C,\nthe reduced \u03c72 increases to 0.92. For all other system sizes investigated the situation is similar. We will return to the\nfinite size behavior of P (m) after the discussion of finite-size scaling.\nC. Finite-size scaling\n\nA naive finite-size scaling ansatz for a thermodynamic quantity X(A, B, L) near a tricritical point in d = 3 is given\nby (compare Eq. (5.2))\nX(A, B, L) = L\u2212dX fX (AL2 , BL),\n\n(5.11)\n\nwhere fX (x, y) is the finite-size scaling function associated with the quantity X and dX is its scaling dimension.\nLogarithmic corrections have been disregarded for simplicity. For the sequence of the pseudo tricritical points (T, \u2206) =\n(Tt (L), \u2206t (L)) one has A = aL\u22122 and B = bL\u22121 (see Eq. (5.5)). In this case one therefore expects X to display the\nscaling behavior\nX(aL\u22122 , bL\u22121 , L) = L\u2212dX fX (a, b) \u2261 X0 L\u2212dX ,\n\n(5.12)\n\nwhich can be conveniently checked numerically. However, near tricritical points in d = 3 one has to consider logarithmic\ncorrections to the naive scaling and these have been examined in Ref. [34]. We therefore only quote the results\ncorresponding to Eq. (5.12) for the average magnetization hmi, the specific heat C and the magnetic susceptibility X .\nOne obtains\n\u00131/4\n\u0012 \u0013\u22121/2 \u0012\nL\nL\nln\n,\nhmi = m0\nl0\nl0\n\u0012\n\u00131/2\nL\nL\nC = C0\nln\n,\n(5.13)\nl0\nl0\n\u0012 \u00132 \u0012\n\u00131/4\nL\nL\nln\nX = X0\n,\nl0\nl0\nwhere the nonuniversal amplitudes m0 , C0 , X0 and the length scale l0 are used as fit parameters. The corresponding\nresults are summarized in Figs. 7 - 9. The data are compatible with the finite-size scaling behavior given by Eq.\n(5.13) (solid lines). The logarithmic corrections turn out to be essential. Disregarding these leads to pure mean field\nbehavior which is not compatible with the data (dashed lines). For the specific heat displayed in Fig. 8 deviations\nfrom the expected behavior occur for larger system sizes L = 48 and L = 60. These may be due to the proximity\nto the first-order demixing transition, which is characterized by a finite latent heat. Including a finite background\ncontribution to the specific heat as an additional fit parameter does not improve the fit. In particular, the attempt\nto fit pure mean field behavior to the data shown in Fig. 8 leads to a negative value for the background specific heat\nwhich is inconsistent with thermodynamics. The susceptibility shown in Fig. 9 appears to agree with the expectation\nfor all system sizes whereas the average magnetization shown in Fig. 7 displays a deviation for L = 60. The values\nof l0 obtained from the fits shown in Figs. 8 and 9 are consistent (l0 = 6.3 \u00b1 0.5 and l0 = 6.2 \u00b1 0.4, respectively)\nwhereas l0 = 1.3 \u00b1 0.3 obtained from hmi according to Fig. 7 deviates strongly from the aforementioned estimates\nfor l0 . One of the reasons may be that hmi depends rather weakly on L and l0 as compared to C and X . Therefore\nthe estimation of l0 from hmi is more susceptible to statistical or systematic errors in the magnetization data. The\nlarge relative error of the actual estimate l0 = 1.3 \u00b1 0.3 seems to indicate this. Corrections to the leading asymptotic\n10\n\n\fbehavior given by Eq. (5.13), which cannot be taken into account on our current data basis, may therefore also play\na role.\nThe scaling behavior of the order parameter distribution function P (m) within the scope of Eq. (5.2) is determined\nby the finite-size behavior of the parameter C. In order to compensate the finite-size effects induced by hmi we define\nthe effective coupling parameter\nCef f \u2261 Chmi6 ,\n\n(5.14)\n\nwhere C is taken from the fit of Eq. (5.2) to the distribution function data along the sequence of the pseudo tricritical\npoints (A = B = 0) and hmi is taken from the fit of Eq. (5.13) to the magnetization data. The numerical result\nfor Cef f according to Eq. (5.14) is displayed in Fig. 10 which shows a slow but systematic decrease of Cef f with\nthe system size. According to the renormalization group theory of tricritical behavior Cef f should play the role of\nthe coupling constant at tricriticality, which is a dangerous irrelevant variable in d = 3 [34]. We therefore expect the\nfinite-size behavior [34]\nCef f (L) =\n\n\u0012\n\u0013\u22121\nL\nc0 + c1 ln\nl0\n\n(5.15)\n\nfor the effective coupling parameter, where l0 = 6.2 is taken from Fig. 9 and c0 and c1 serve as fit parameters to the\ndata. The solid line in Fig. 10 displays this fit with c0 = 9.9 \u00b1 0.2 and c1 = 1.6 \u00b1 0.1 and demonstrates, that the\nexpected behavior according to Eq. (5.15) is consistent with the data.\nThe degree of agreement between the finite-size scaling behavior observed and expected may also be considered\nas an a posteriori confirmation that the sequence of the pseudo tricritical points gives a reasonable estimate for the\nlocation of the tricritical point. However, some confirmation from a different source would still be desirable.\nD. Other distribution functions and the cumulant method\n\nIn order to locate the first-order coexistence line one may inspect the distribution function P (n) of the particle\ndensity\nX\nti .\n(5.16)\nn \u2261 L\u22123\ni\n\nNear a first-order demixing transition P (n) displays two peaks, one at a higher density corresponding to the spin\n(4 He) rich liquid and one at a lower density corresponding to the vacancy (3 He) rich liquid. At the tricritical point\nthe two peaks coalesce and they separate increasingly as one follows the two-phase coexistence line towards lower\ntemperatures. As a criterion to locate the coexistence line one may demand that the ratio of the statistical weights\nof the two liquids, i.e., the ratio of the areas under the respective peaks of P (n), should not depend on temperature.\nHowever, this criterion is only approximate, because a priori it is not clear what the value of the weight ratio should be.\nAn accurate criterion can be obtained from the evaluation of the field mixing [32] (see Eq. (5.8)). From thermodynamic\nconsiderations one may determine a linear combination of particle and energy density such that the corresponding\ndistribution function is symmetric on the coexistence line [32]. The generally unknown value of the weight ratio then\nhas to be unity at coexistence. In principle, one may determine the correct mixing ratio of the densities from Eqs.\n(5.7) and (5.8). However, the statistical uncertainties of the coefficients given by Eq. (5.7) are too large for this\npurpose and their accurate evaluation is beyond the scope of this work.\nFor the vector BEG model the task of locating the first-order coexistence line is aided by the observation that\nthe spin rich fluid displays long-ranged XY type (superfluid) order when the demixing transition occurs. Apart from\nthe particle density distribution (see Eq. (5.16)) we therefore also observe the distribution function of the magnetic\nenergy density \u03b5m defined by\nX\nti tj cos(\u03b8i \u2212 \u03b8j ).\n(5.17)\n\u03b5m \u2261 \u2212JL\u22123\n<ij>\n\nFor our choice J = K the demixing transition will also be indicated by a double peak structure of the distribution\nfunction P (\u03b5m ). Note that this will no longer be the case for sufficiently large K > J, for which the demixing\ntransition precedes the onset of long-ranged magnetic order. By monitoring both distribution functions along various\npaths in the (T, \u2206) plane of the phase diagram and by applying the constant weight ratio criterion to both we have\nredetermined the slope of the coexistence line in the vicinity of (Tt , \u2206t ) (see Eq. (5.6)) and found\n11\n\n\f\u2206\u2032t = (5.0 \u00b1 0.1)J/Ts (0).\n\n(5.18)\n\nNote that the new estimate given by Eq. (5.18) is consistent with the previous one given by Eq. (5.10). We\nfurthermore observe, that the two peaks indeed merge into a single but broader one very close to the estimate of\n(Tt , \u2206t ) given by Eq. (5.6). We illustrate this for P (n) in Fig. 11 for L = 36 along a straight path in the phase\ndiagram according to Eq. (5.9) for the choice Tt /T s(0) = 0.7439, \u2206t /J = 3.438 and \u2206\u2032t = 5.0J/Ts (0) (see Eq. (5.18))\nfor three temperatures. In order to obtain a clear double peak structure in P (n) including the transition from and\nto a single peak along the chosen path a substantial amount of fine tuning for both Tt and \u2206t is required even for\nmoderate system sizes. It is therefore very comforting that the values for Tt and \u2206t required to obtain Fig. 11 are\nalready within the error bars of the extrapolation estimate of the tricritical point given by Eq. (5.6). The structure\nof P (\u03b5m ) essentially looks the same so we do not reproduce it here.\nThe location of the tricritical point along the coexistence line can be identified by a cumulant crossing of a suitably\nchosen density [32]. As we have not evaluated the field mixing here we use the cumulants of the magnetic energy\ndensity defined by Eq. (5.17) in order to investigate the cumulant crossing along the straight path used in Fig. 11.\nWe define the Binder cumulant ratio for \u03b5m by\nU\u03b5m \u2261 1 \u2212\n\nh(\u03b5m \u2212 h\u03b5m i)4 i\n.\n3h(\u03b5m \u2212 h\u03b5m i)2 i2\n\n(5.19)\n\nThe cumulant U\u03b5m as function of temperature for different system sizes is shown in Fig. 12. A unique crossing cannot\nbe identified. However, the various crossings occur roughly where they are expected according to Eq. (5.6). If the\nsmallest system L = 12 is excluded the crossings are located in the temperature interval 0.743 < T /Ts (0) < 0.747\nwhich includes the estimate given by Eq. (5.6) near the lower bound. The crossings for larger systems tend to\noccur at lower temperatures. One of the reasons that a unique crossing does not occur is that both \u03b5m and n contain\ncorrections to the order parameter of the demixing transition which can only be eliminated by a properly chosen linear\ncombination of these quantities [32]. A second reason is insufficient fine tuning for larger systems, which becomes\nvisible in the nonmonotonic behavior of U\u03b5m for L = 36 at lower temperatures which leads to a second intersection\nwith U\u03b5m for L = 24. Despite the quantitative shortcomings of Fig. 12 the investigation of the cumulant crossing\nin combination with the other evidence presented above provides some independent confirmation that our initial\nassertion about the shape of the tricritical order parameter distribution function according to Eq. (5.2) is correct\nwithin the accuracy needed for the purpose of this work.\nConsiderations in the spirit of Landau mean-field theory have played a major role for the analysis of our numerical\ndata in the tricritical region. We therefore now turn to a detailed derivation of the Ginzburg - Landau model in the\ntricritical region of the vector BEG model.\nVI. LANDAU-GINZBURG MODEL FOR 3 HE-4 HE MIXTURES.\n\nIn this section we derive a two-parameter Landau-Ginzburg (LG) model describing bulk 3 He-4 He mixtures near\ntricriticality. This derivation follows the construction of the \u03c64 model for the standard critical phenomena from the\nIsing model.\nA. Derivation of the model\n\nOur starting point is the modified VBEG model for which instead of continuum orientations of the spin vector\n(l)\nSi = (cos \u03b8i , sin \u03b8i ) we consider L discrete orientations \u03b8i = 2\u03c0l/L, l = 1, * * * , L, uniformly distributed over the\n(l)\n(l)\n(l)\nunit circle with L \u2192 \u221e. With each orientation Si = (cos \u03b8i , sin \u03b8i ) at the site i we associate the density ti,l with\ndiscrete values 0 or 1. The total density of 4 He at the site i is\nti =\n\nL\nX\n\nti,l .\n\n(6.1)\n\nl=1\n\nAs in the VBEG model we consider the close-packing case in which a 3 He atom at site i corresponds to ti = 0 and\na 4 He atom to ti = 1. Thus a lattice site i is either occupied by a 3 He atom (ti = 0) or a 4 He atom associated with\nPL\none of the L orientatons (ti,l = 1 for l = l0 , ti,l = 0 otherwise, so that ti = l=1 ti,l = 1). The Hamiltonian of this\neffectively (L + 1)- component mixture has the form\n12\n\n\fH=\u2212\n\nX\n\n{J\n\n<ij>\n(l)\n\n(l\u2032 )\n\n(l)\n\nL X\nL\nX\n\n(l)\n\n(l\u2032 )\n\nti,l tj,l\u2032 Si * Sj\n\n+ Kti tj } + \u2206\n\nX\n\nti ,\n\n(6.2)\n\ni\n\nl=1 l\u2032 =1\n\n(l\u2032 )\n\nwhere Si * Sj = cos(\u03b8i \u2212 \u03b8j ).\nIn the Landau-Ginzburg model the effective Hamiltonian, depending on the local order-parameter fields, is obtained\nas a result of coarse-graining procedures. The procedure which gives an exact functional representation for the\npartition function for the corresponding microscopic Hamiltonian is the Hubbard-Stratonovitch transformation. The\napplication of this method, however, is limited to microscopic Hamiltonians that can be expressed as a quadratic\nform. Here we use another approach [35].\nWithin the standard mean-field treatment of the lattice gas mixture defined by the Hamiltonian in Eq.(6.2) the\nensemble-avaraged occupancy \u03c1i,l =< ti,l > of the site i is obtained by minimizing the grand canonical function\nX\nfid (\u03c1i,l )\n(6.3)\n\u03a9MF (\u03c1i,l ) = H(\u03c1i,l ) +\ni\n\nat fixed T and \u2206. The resulting minimum of \u03a9MF equals the equilibrium grand potential \u03a90 . The ideal or noninteracting free-energy density for a (L + 1) component mixture on the close-packed lattice is [18]\nfid (\u03c1i,l ) = kB T {(1 \u2212 \u03c1i ) ln(1 \u2212 \u03c1i ) +\n\nL\nX\n\n\u03c1i,l ln \u03c1i,l },\n\n(6.4)\n\nl=1\n\nPL\nwith \u03c1i = l=1 \u03c1i,l .\nIn the following we shall treat \u03c1i and \u03c1i,l as coarse-grained order parameter fields and adopt the mean field grand\ncanonical function \u03a9MF form for the free energy of a particular local configuration of the order parameter. In the\nspatially uniform and orientationally disordered phase the equilibrium values of \u03c1i,l are constant and denoted by\n< \u03c1i,l >= Q/L so that < \u03c1i >= Q. The actual values fluctuate around these mean values:\n\u03c1i = Q + \u03c6i\n\n\u03c1i,l =\n\n(6.5)\n\nQ \u03c6i\n\u03c1i\n+\n+ \u2206\u03c1i,l =\n+ \u2206\u03c1i,l ,\nL\nL\nL\n\n(6.6)\n\nP\nwhich implies < \u03c6i >= 0 and l \u2206\u03c1i,l = 0 even without taking the thermal average. The fluctuation of the density\n\u03c1i,l at the site i consists of an orientationally uniform part \u03c6i /L related to the fluctuation \u03c6i of the total 4 He density,\n(l)\nwhich is the same for all orientations, and a contribution \u2206\u03c1i,l as an excess density of 4 He in the orientation Si .\nMF\nAssuming \u2206\u03c1i,l and \u03c6i to be small we expand \u03a9\n(\u03c1i , \u03c1i,l ) in power series of the fluctuation fields \u2206\u03c1i,l and \u03c6i\nabout the equilibrium value \u03a9MF\n(\u03c1i = Q, \u03c1i,l = Q/L). Since we aim for deriving an effective Hamiltonian describing\n0\nbulk 3 He-4 He mixtures near tricriticality, in the expansion we keep terms to the sixth order in \u2206\u03c1i,l and to quadratic\norder in \u03c6i .

To this end we consider spatially uniform order parameter fields.\nMean-field theory amounts to approximating the thermodynamic free energy by the minimum of the effective\nHamiltonian which corresponds to the saddle point path contribution to the partition function:\n\u03b2FMF = min\u03c6,u \u03b2\u03a9ef f [\u03c6, u].\n\n(6.37)\n\nThe mean-field solution for \u03c6(r) is determined by\n\u03b4\u03a9ef f\n= 0.\n\u03b4\u03c6(r)\n\n(6.38)\n\nFor spatially uniform fields the above minimum condition yields the following relation between \u03c6 and |u|:\n\u03c6(a1 + 2a12 |u|2 + 2b12 |u|4 ) + r1 |u|2 + r2 |u|4 = 0.\n\n(6.39)\n\nNear a tricritical point both the fields \u03c6 and |u| are small.

(3.19) and (3.20), i.e., the tricritical\npoint of this LG model is located at the same temperature and concentration of 3 He atoms as the tricritical point in\nthe VBEG model studied in Sec. III within mean field approximation.\nVII. SUMMARY\n\nBy using molecular-field approximations and Monte Carlo simulations we have investigated a three-dimensional\nversion of the generalized spin-1 Blume-Emery-Griffith model (Eq. (2.1)) of 3 He-4 He mixtures with a two-component\nvector order parameter, mimicing the phase of the wavefunction of 4 He atoms. This work is a first step to study the\nCasimir force and other surface and finite-size effects in 3 He-4 He mixtures films near their tricritical point. We have\nobtained the following main results:\n1. The topology of the phase diagram depends on the ratio of the interaction parameters K/J, where K is related\nto the \u03b1 He-\u03b2 He interactions (Eq. (2.2)) and J to the superfluid density (Eq. (2.4)). There are three different\ntypes of the phase diagram, which are similar to those found in the BEG model within the molecular-field\napproximation. For large values of K/J, i.e., for K/J > 2.01681, there exist three different phases: a 3 He-rich\n'normal' fluid, a 4 He-rich 'normal' fluid, and a 4 He-rich superfluid (see Fig. 1). As the temperature is lowered,\nthe mixed normal fluid phase separates into two 'normal' fluids differing by the concentration x of 3 He. This\nphase separation ends at a critical point. At lower temperature, the phase separation is into a superfluid and\na 'normal' fluid. The \u03bb-line Ts (x) of second-order phase transitions between a 4 He-rich 'normal' fluid and a\n4\nHe-rich superfluid terminates at the 4 He-rich branch of the phase-separation curve at the critical end point.\nThis 'critical end-point' type of the phase diagram was the only one found in previous studies [15,16] of the twodimensional version of the model. In three dimensions we find two additional topologies of the phase diagram\nas the ratio K/J is decreased. For 1.4298 < K/J < 2.01681 the phase diagram is the richest (see Fig. 2). As in\nthe previous case, there are three different phases and a critical point of the phase-separation curve between two\n'normal' fluids differing by the concentration of 3 He. In addition, there is a tricritical point at the end of the\n\u03bb-line beyond which a first-order phase transition between a 4 He-rich superfluid and a 4 He-rich 'normal' fluid\ntakes place. There is also a triple point at which three different phases coexist at different concentrations. For\nK/J < 1.4298 the phase diagram simplifies (see Fig. 3). There is no longer a 4 He-rich 'normal' fluid phase and a\ncritical point. The \u03bb-line meets the first-order phase separation line between 4 He-rich superfluid and a 3 He-rich\n'normal' fluid at the tricritical point. The \u03bb-line is given by Ts (x) = zJ(1 \u2212 x)/2, where z is the coordination\nnumber of the lattice. The temperature of the tricritical point is TA /Ts (0) = (1+2K/J)/(2+2K/J) (Eq. (3.19))\nand the concentration xA of 3 He at this point is given by TA /Ts (0) = 1 \u2212 xA (Eq. (3.20)). This type of the\nphase diagram is similar to that observed experimentally, although in our model xA is always smaller than 0.5\nwhereas xexp\nA = 0.669.\n2. The existence of the tricritical point is confirmed by Monte Carlo simulations and in the units (Tt /Ts (0), \u2206t /J) it\ncoincides with the mean-field prediction remarkably well (see Fig. 3). At the tricritical point the order parameter\ndistribution function takes its mean-field form, where the presence of logarithmic corrections could not be\nexcluded within the accuracy of the existing data. On the other hand finite-size scaling of several thermodynamic\nquantities reveals the presence of logarithmic corrections in accordance with theoretical expectations. The twophase coexistence line in the (T, \u2206) plane of the phase diagram has been determined form a constant weight\nratio criterion for energy and density histograms. The location of the tricritical point is also indicated by a\ncrossing of the cumulant ratio of the magnetic portion of the energy density measured along the coexistence line\n(see Fig. 12). We conclude that mean-field theory provides a reliable approach for studying the VBEG model\nin d = 3.\n17\n\n\f3. Starting from the VBEG model and discretizing the orientations of the spin vector we have derived the continuum\nLandau-Ginzburg model for 3 He-4 He mixtures near the tricritical point encompassing the concentration field \u03c6\nand a two-component vector field u corresponding to the orientational order. In the effective Hamiltonian we\nconsider the modulus of u up to its sixth power and the field \u03c6 up to quadratic terms, which is sufficient to\nstudy a tricritical point. The coupling constants appearing in this Landau-Ginzburg theory are given explicitly in\nterms of thermodynamical quantities, the temperature, the mean concentration of 4 He, and the two interaction\nparameters J and K characterizing the VBEG model. Mean-field theory for this LG model yields the same\nequation for the critical \u03bb-line as the molecular-field approximation for the lattice VBEG model. The LG model\nprovides a linear coupling between |u|2 and \u03c6 which yields the same coordinates of the tricritical point as the\nlattice VBEG model.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nA.M. is grateful for the hospitality accorded by the Max-Planck-Institut f\u00fcr Metallforschung in Stuttgart, Germany.\nShe appreciates fruitful discussions with Alina Ciach.

Phase diagram in the (\u2206, T ), (a), and (x, T ), (b), plane for the model given by Eq. (2.1) obtained whithin mean-field\ntheory for K/J = 2.4. x is the 3 He concentration. There are three phases which can be identified as a 3 He-rich normal fluid\n(M = 0, x = 1 \u2212 Q large), a 4 He-rich normal fluid (M = 0, x small), and a 4 He-rich superfluid S (M 6= 0, x small). In (a)\nthe dashed line represents second-order phase transitions and corresponds to the \u03bb-line; full lines are the loci of first-order\nphase transitions. For this value of K/J there is no tricritical point. The \u03bb-line of second-order phase transitions terminates at the phase-separation curve at the critical end point E. The two-phase region in (b) and the line of first-order phase\ntransitions in (a) end at a critical point C.
