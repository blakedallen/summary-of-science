The data show H\u03b1, [NII] 6583,6548,\nand [OIII] 5007 lines at a redshift of z = 2.51. The high nuclear [NII]/H\u03b1 line ratio is consistent with\na LINER or Type-II AGN. The H\u03b1 emission is spatially resolved, suggesting the presence of significant star-forming activity outside the nucleus.

After the correction for\nlensing, N4 is the weakest intrinsic sub-mm selected source with a known redshift and represents the\nfirst redshift for the < 2 mJy 850\u03bcm sources which are responsible for the bulk of the emission from the\nsub-mm population as a whole. We argue that N4 contains either an AGN or LINER nucleus surrounded\nby an extended region of active star-formation.\nSubject headings: galaxies: active - galaxies: evolution - galaxies: formation - galaxies: individual\n(SMM J04431+0210) - galaxies: starburst\nGenzel et al. 1998; Veilleux, Kim, & Sanders 1999). In\norder to understand the nature of the sub-mm population,\nwe have been carrying out multi-wavelength observations\nof individual systems in the SCUBA Cluster Lens Survey\n(Smail et al. 2002). This survey consists of 15 background\nsub-mm sources identified from sensitive sub-mm mapping\nof seven massive, lensing clusters. The advantage of this\nsample is that the amplification of the background sources\nallows for deeper source frame observations.\nIn this paper we report a redshift of z = 2.5092 \u00b1 0.0008\nfor the sub-mm galaxy SMM J04431+0210 (N4), obtained\nfrom near-infrared observations with the NIRSPEC instrument on the Keck II telescope. The galaxy N4 at\n04h 43m07.s 1, +02\u25e6 10\u2032 25\u2032\u2032 (J2000) was previously identified\nas the likely sub-mm counterpart based on its extremely\nred I\u2212K color (Smail et al. 1999). An increasing number\nof sub-mm sources are now believed to be extremely red\nobjects (EROs [R \u2212 K > 6]) due to their high dust content (Smail et al. 1999; Gear et al. 2000; Lutz et al. 2001;\nIvison et al. 2001; Wehner, Barger, & Kneib 2002). Since\nN4 is the brightest K-band (2.2\u03bcm) ERO counterpart in\nthe Cluster Lens Survey, it is an ideal candidate for testing\nwhether redshifts can be obtained for the SCUBA population in the near-infrared. In addition, N4 has a 850\u03bcm flux\ndensity of only 1.6 mJy, after correcting for lensing, making it one of the intrinsically weakest sub-mm sources yet\nidentified. Studies of weak sub-mm sources such as N4 are\ncrucial to our understanding of the population as a whole\nsince the majority of the sub-mm background arises from\nsources with S(850\u03bcm)< 2 mJy (Blain et al. 1999a; Cowie,\n\n1. INTRODUCTION\n\nSince the discovery of the submillimeter population of\ngalaxies (Smail, Ivison, & Blain 1997; Hughes et al. 1998;\nBarger et al. 1998; Eales et al. 1999), extensive follow-up\nobservations across the entire electromagnetic spectrum\nranging from X-ray to radio wavelengths have been obtained (see review by Blain et al. [2002]). Despite these\nobservational efforts, fundamental questions remain about\nthe population as a whole, foremost among these are the\nredshift distribution and dominant energy source heating\nthe dust. Detailed studies of individual sub-mm galaxies\nare crucial in answering these questions, however, progress\nhas been slow since many sub-mm sources are extremely\nfaint in their observed optical bands. Several of the original potential bright optical counterparts are now suspected\nto be mis-identifications based on deep near-infrared observations (Smail et al. 1999; Frayer et al. 2000; Dunlop\net al. 2003) and redshift estimates based on radio data\n(Smail et al. 2000; Webb et al. 2003).\nThe current data show that the sub-mm population has\na mixture of AGN and starburst characteristics with properties which are roughly consistent with those of the local\npopulation of ultraluminous (L > 1012 L\u2299 ) infrared galaxies (ULIRGs). The molecular CO line data for the submm galaxies show the presence of sufficient molecular gas\nto fuel high levels of star-formation activity (Frayer et al.\n1998, 1999). However, the relative importance of AGN\nand starburst activity in powering the high luminosities of\nthe sub-mm population is still open to debate, as is the\ncase with local ULIRGs (e.g., Sanders & Mirabel 1996;\n1 SIRTF\n\nScience Center, California Institute of Technology 220\u201306, Pasadena, CA 91125, USA\nDepartment, California Institute of Technology 105\u201324, Pasadena, CA 91125, USA\n3 Astronomy Technology Centre, Royal Observatory, Blackford Hill, Edinburgh EH9 3HJ, UK\n4 Institute for Computational Cosmology, University of Durham, South Road, Durham, DH1 3LE, UK\n\n2 Astronomy\n\n1\n\n\f2\n\nThe z = 2.51 Submillimeter Galaxy SMM J04431+0210\n\nBarger, & Kneib 2002). We also report on follow-up CO\nobservations with the OVRO Millimeter Array to search\nfor molecular gas, as well as optical spectroscopy with the\nESI instrument on the Keck II telescope to search for additional rest-frame optical and ultraviolet (UV) emission\nlines. The observations presented in this paper are summarized in Table 1.\nA cosmology of Ho = 70 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 , \u03a9M = 0.3, and\n\u03a9\u039b = 0.7 is assumed throughout this paper. We adopt the\nlensing amplification factor of f = 4.4 which was derived\nby Smail et al. (1999) and includes both the amplification due to the foreground cluster potential and the spiral\ngalaxy near the position of N4.\n2. OBSERVATIONS AND DATA REDUCTION\n\n2.1. Spectroscopy\nN4 was observed with NIRSPEC (Near Infrared Spectrograph) on Keck II5 on 2000 December 26. NIRSPEC is\na spectrograph operating over 0.95 to 5.4\u03bcm (McLean et\nal. 1998). Observations were obtained in low-resolution\nmode (R\u223c1500) with a 0.\u2032\u2032 76 (4 pixel) wide slit. The seeing was typically 0.\u2032\u2032 5 during the spectroscopic observations. The 42\u2032\u2032 length slit was placed at a position angle of\n\u221214\u25e6 to contain both N4 and the core of the bright nearby\ngalaxy 3.\u2032\u2032 1 from N4 (Fig. 1). We used the nspec7 filter\nto search the entire K-band and obtained 130 minutes of\nuseful on-source integration. H\u03b1 emission was detected at\nz = 2.51 (Sec. 3.1).\nIn 2002 August we followed up the K-band detection\nof H\u03b1 by searching for the [OIII] 5007, 4959 doublet and\nH\u03b2 line in H-band using NIRSPEC. We used the same slit\nsetup as done previously for K-band. The nspec6 filter was\nused since it is optimized on the redward side of H-band\nat the wavelengths of the redshifted emission lines.\nThe NIRSPEC data were combined in pairs at two different positions along the slit. This provided a zerothorder background subtraction as well as removing the dark\nand bias levels from the data. Pixel-to-pixel gain variations were removed by dividing by a normalized flat produced from halogen lamp images. The spectra were transformed to produce a linear spatial and wavelength scale\nusing standard tasks in the IRAF LONGSLIT package.6\nObservations of a star nodded along the slit provided spatial calibration, while neon and argon arc lamp lines as\nwell as sky lines provided wavelength calibration. A linear\nbackground was subtracted from the frames as a function\nof wavelength to remove time variations in the sky emission. The spectra of bright calibration stars were used to\ncorrect for variations in the detector response as a function\nof wavelength.\nGiven its proximity, residual light from the nearby\ngalaxy is present in the extracted spectrum of N4 after\nstandard data reduction. In order to obtain the true continuum level and spectral slope for N4, the wings of the\ngalaxy light were subtracted from N4 as a function of wavelength. There is a natural trade-off between the signalto-noise (S/N) ratio of the final spectrum and the wave-\n\nlength resolution over which the subtraction is done. We\nsmoothed over two resolution elements in wavelength for\nthe galaxy subtraction, which left a slight residual narrow Paschen-\u03b1 emission line from the foreground galaxy\n(z = 0.18) at 2.1\u03bcm. The resulting continuum level of\nthe K-band spectrum was calibrated by averaging over the\nemission from 2 to 2.4\u03bcm and placed on the K-band magnitude scale derived from the NIRC imaging (Sec. 2.2). The\nabsolute flux level of the H-band spectrum was calculated\nusing the continuum levels of the bright nearby galaxy and\nN4 at 2.0\u03bcm, where the H- and K-band spectra have overlapping wavelength coverage.\nIn 2002 August we also obtained follow-up spectroscopy\nobservations with the ESI (Echellette Spectrograph and\nImager) instrument (Sheinis et al. 2002) on Keck II to\nsearch for additional emission lines in the rest-frame ultraviolet and optical bands. The ESI data were taken in the\nhigh-resolution echelle mode which provided wavelength\ncoverage from 3900\u00c5 to 1100\u00c5 at a resolution of approximately 11 km s\u22121 . A slit with a width of 1.\u2032\u2032 25 was used.\nThe ESI optical spectra were calibrated using the spectrophotometric standard Feige 110 (Massey et al. 1988).\n\n2.2. Near-Infrared Imaging\nWe observed N4 using the Near Infrared Camera (NIRC)\non Keck I in 1999 October in K-band and 2001 August in\nJ and K-band. NIRC employs a 256 \u00d7 256 pixel InSb detector with a pixel scale of 0.\u2032\u2032 15 (Matthews & Soifer 1994).\nThe standard K-band filter was used instead of the bluer\nKs filter since the object is extremely red. We observed\nusing a random dithered pattern with about 10\u2032\u2032 between\nadjacent dither positions. Sixty second integrations were\ntaken at each position. A total of 22 and 74 minutes of onsource data were obtained in the K and J filters, respectively. The seeing-disks of the stars observed throughout\nthe exposures varied from about 0.\u2032\u2032 5 to 0.\u2032\u2032 7 (FWHM).\nSets of dark frames from each night were subtracted\nfrom each exposure to remove the dark current as well\nas the bias level.

A total of 23 hours of usable integration time on source was obtained in two configurations of\nsix 10.4m telescopes. The array configurations yielded a\n6\u2032\u2032 \u00d7 5\u2032\u2032 synthesized beam adopting natural-weighting. We\nused a digital correlator configured with 112\u00d74 MHz channels centered on 98.5174 GHz to search for CO(3\u21922) emission at the corresponding H\u03b1 line redshift of z = 2.510.\nThe spectral-line bandwidth corresponds to 1400 km s\u22121\n(\u2206z = \u00b10.005), which is sufficiently large to observe the\nentire H\u03b1 line width, including the redshift uncertainty\n(Sec. 3.1). In addition to the CO line data, 3mm continuum data were recorded with a bandwidth of 2 GHz. The\nnearby quasar J0433+053 was observed every 25 minutes\nfor gain and phase calibration. Absolute flux calibration\nwas determined from observations of the standard calibrator 3C 273 whose flux history is monitored by observations\nof Uranus and Neptune. The absolute flux calibration uncertainty for the data is approximately 15%. The data\nwere reduced using the OVRO MMA software (Scoville et\nal. 1983) and standard tasks in AIPS.8\n3. RESULTS\n\nThe identification of N4 as the sub-mm counterpart is\nfairly secure based on previous studies. As discussed by\nSmail et al. (1999), the nearby z = 0.18 spiral galaxy\ncan be reliably ruled out based on its radio/sub-mm flux\ndensity ratio and its 450\u03bcm limit. The random probability of finding a bright ERO similarly as red (R \u2212 K > 6)\nas N4 within the 3\u2032\u2032 positional uncertainty of the SCUBA\ndata is less than 0.1%, based on the observed ERO surface\ndensities for K < 20 (Thompson et al. 1999; Smith et al.\n2002). If we relax the sub-mm positional uncertainty and\naccount for lensing, the likelihood of a chance coincidence\nwith an ERO is still less than 1%, and no other candidate red objects are nearby. The identification of N4 as\nthe sub-mm counterpart has recently been confirmed by\nthe detection of CO emission from N4 at the H\u03b1 redshift\nwith the IRAM PdB interferometer (R. Neri et al. 2003,\nin preparation). The OVRO CO upper-limit presented in\nthis paper is consistent with the more sensitive PdB observations.\n3.1. Spectroscopy\nAn emission-line complex is clearly detected in the Kband spectrum of N4 (Fig. 2), which is identified as\nH\u03b1+[NII] at z = 2.51. We also detect evidence for\na weak emission line at 1.756\u03bcm, which corresponds to\n[OIII] 5007\u00c5 at the H\u03b1 redshift (Fig. 3). Fits to the\nlines and continuum were made using the SPECFIT\npackage in IRAF (Table 2). In fitting the H\u03b1+[NII]\nline complex, we have allowed the widths and fluxes\nof the H\u03b1 and [NII]6583\u00c5 lines to be free, while fixing the [NII]6548\u00c5 line to have a flux of 30% that of\n[NII]6583\u00c5. Both [NII] lines were constrained to have the\nsame FWHM. The continuum was fitted with a linear function. Initially the position of the [NII]6583\u00c5 line was\nfixed with respect to H\u03b1, but this requirement was later\nrelaxed to derive the redshift and to confirm the identifi-\n\n3\n\ncation. From the fit to the total K-band spectrum, we derive a redshift of z = 2.5092 \u00b1 0.0008 based on the H\u03b1 and\nNII 6583 lines. The redshift uncertainty includes the error from the fit and the systematic uncertainty associated\nwith the derived wavelength scale. The intrinsic H\u03b1 line\nwidth is 520 \u00b1 40 km s\u22121 , corrected for instrumental resolution, while the [NII] lines are slightly narrower, having\nan intrinsic FWHM of 440\u00b160 km s\u22121 . The [NII] 6583/H\u03b1\nline flux ratio is found to be 0.47 \u00b1 0.06. No broad-line H\u03b1\ncomponent is readily visible in the data. The 1\u03c3 upperlimit on a 5000 km s\u22121 broad H\u03b1 line is about 10% of the\nH\u03b1 narrow-line flux.\nThe H-band data were fitted adopting the same techniques as used for the K-band data. The [OIII] line was fitted to derive the wavelength position, line width, and line\nflux. In deriving the H\u03b2 limit, we assumed the H\u03b1 redshift\nand linewidth. The observed limit on the [OIII]5007/H\u03b2\nflux ratio is greater than 1.5 (3\u03c3).\nThe observed Balmer decrement of H\u03b1/H\u03b2 > 6 (3\u03c3) implies significant extinction. Assuming the standard intrinsic H\u03b1/H\u03b2 value of 2.85 (Case-B Balmer recombination\ndecrement for T= 104 K and Ne = 104 cm\u22123 [Osterbrock\n1989]) and the Galactic reddening function parameterized\nby Lequeux et al. (1979), we derive an extinction at H\u03b1 of\ngreater than 1.6 mag and a color excess of E(B-V) > 0.7\nmag. The high-level of extinction implied by the H\u03b1/H\u03b2\nratio is consistent with the non-detection of Ly\u03b1 emission\nfrom the ESI observations (Table 2).\nFigure 4 shows the two-dimensional image of the K-band\nspectrum. The H\u03b1 emission is spatially resolved, while the\n[NII] emission is consistent with a compact object. The\nsize of H\u03b1 emission region is about 1.1 arcsec, after deconvolution with a Gaussian representing the seeing point\nspread function. Corrected for lensing, the intrinsic diameter of the detected H\u03b1 emission regions is about 2 kpc. If\nthe observed velocity gradient is due to rotation, a rough\nestimate of the dynamical mass can be made based on the\nH\u03b1 line width. The H\u03b1 emission is spread over 750 km s\u22121\n(FWZI), and using a radius of 1.0 kpc we calculate a dynamical mass of 3\u00d71010 sin(i)\u22122 M\u2299 , where the inclination\n(i) is unknown. The estimated dynamical mass of N4 is\ncomparable with masses found in the central regions of\nnormal galaxies in the local universe.\nFigure 5 shows spectra extracted from the different regions of N4. The [NII] 6583/H\u03b1 line flux ratio varies measurably as a function of distance from the nucleus of N4.\nThe off-nuclear data have a [NII] 6583/H\u03b1 line flux ratio of\n0.16 \u00b1 0.06, consistent with star-forming regions, while the\nnuclear region has a much higher ratio of 0.66 \u00b1 0.09, indicative of an AGN or a LINER (Osterbrock 1989). Therefore, the data for N4 are consistent with a narrow-line\nAGN surrounded by an extended region of active starformation (Baldwin, Phillips, & Terlevich 1981; Veilleux &\nOsterbrock 1987) or a powerful starburst with large-scale\nnuclear shocks driven by a nuclear superwind. (Armus,\nHeckman, & Miley 1989; Heckman, Armus, & Miley 1990)\n.\n3.2. Imaging\n\n7 The Owens Valley Millimeter Array is a radio telescope facility operated by the California Institute of Technology and is supported by\nNSF grant AST 9981546.\n8 AIPS is the Astronomical Image Processing System sofware package written and supported by the National Radio Astronomy Observatory.\n\n\f4\n\nThe z = 2.51 Submillimeter Galaxy SMM J04431+0210\n\nThe sensitive HST R-band (F702W filter) and Keck\nLRIS I-band images of N4 have been previously discussed\nby Smail et al. (1999). We compare these optical images\nwith the deep J- and K-band data presented in this paper. In all bands we subtracted the nearby galaxy using\nthe IRAF task ELLIPSE, which enabled source masking\nwhile successfully removing the wings of the galaxy emission. The images were aligned using common sources in\nthe frames. For optimization in K-band, we adopted a 2\u2032\u2032\ndiameter aperture for photometry. Although the S/N ratios from the aperture measurements in the other bands\nare lower than for K-band (Table 3), the emission peak\nwas detected in each of the four bands with a S/N ratio\ngreater than five. The errors on the measurements represent the rms of multiple aperture measurements on the sky\naround N4, avoiding the galaxy residuals from the central\ndisk. We measure the colors of R \u2212 K = 6.34 \u00b1 0.27 mag\nand J \u2212 K = 3.15 \u00b1 0.29 mag for N4. The R \u2212 K measurement presented here is slightly bluer than the original\nR \u2212 K > 6.7 color quoted by Smail et al. (1999), which\nis attributed to the difference in the adopted aperture size\nand methods of galaxy subtraction.\nWe have resolved N4 in both the R and K-band images (Fig. 6). After deconvolution of the 0.\u2032\u2032 6 stellar PSF,\napproximated by a Gaussian, we derive a FWHM size of\n1.\u2032\u2032 1 \u00b1 0.\u2032\u20322 for the K-band emission, consistent with the H\u03b1\nsource size (Sec. 3.1). The K-band image is extended in\nthe north-south direction, along the expected direction of\nlensing amplification, while the R-band image appears extended east-west. The K-band peak is marginally offset\nalong the line of R-band elongation, but its derived position is coincident with the R-band peak within the errors.\nOffsets between the K-band and R-band emission regions\nare not unexpected given the high level of extinction within\nN4 and given previous results for sub-mm galaxies (Ivison\net al. 2001).\n3.3. Dust and Molecular Gas\nThe OVRO CO observations yield a 3\u03c3 upper-limit\nof 4.5 mJy/beam, averaging over the H\u03b1 line-width of\n520 km s\u22121 with a natural-weighted beam size of 6\u2032\u2032 \u00d7 5\u2032\u2032 .\nThe limit on the integrated CO(3\u21922) flux density of\nS(CO) < 2.5 Jy km s\u22121 corresponds to a CO luminosity\nof L\u2032 (CO) < 1.9 \u00d7 1010 K km s\u22121 pc2 , correcting for lensing. The CO to H2 conversion factor is still uncertain\nfor the sub-mm population. Adopting a conversion factor\nof L\u2032 (CO)/M(gas) = 2 K km s\u22121 pc2 ( M\u2299 yr\u22121 )\u22121 , which\nis appropriate for low redshift ULIRGs (Solomon et al.\n1997; Scoville, Yun, & Bryant 1999), the observations imply M(gas)< 4 \u00d7 1010 M\u2299 for N4. The limit on the gas\nmass is comparable to the total dynamical mass estimated\nfrom the H\u03b1 line-width (Sec. 3.1). The CO(3\u21922) luminosity limit is slightly lower than the previous CO detections\nfor sub-mm selected galaxies (Frayer et al. 1998, 1999),\nafter converting to the same cosmology, but is well within\nexpectations given the lower 850\u03bcm flux density for N4.\nWe failed to detect 3mm continuum emission from N4,\nachieving a 3\u03c3 upper-limit of S(100 GHz)< 1.5 mJy. The\n3mm continuum limit is consistent with the previous\nSCUBA measurements of N4 (Smail et al. 1999). The\nspectral energy distribution (SED) for N4 is consistent\nwith those found for previous sub-mm galaxies (Ivison et\n\nal. 2000) and local ULIRGs. Based on its redshift and the\nlimit on its 850\u03bcm/1.4GHz flux ratio, we estimate a dust\ntemperature of T> 40 K from the Carilli & Yun (1999) relationship plotted as a function of temperature by Blain et\nal. (2002). The dust temperature is consistent with both\ncool and warm infrared SEDs found for ULIRGs (Soifer et\nal. 1989).\n4. DISCUSSION\n\nAs mentioned in Section 3, the rest-frame optical\nemission-line flux ratios of N4 imply a composite source.\nThe relatively large nuclear [NII]/H\u03b1 and [OIII]/H\u03b2 ratios are suggestive of a non-thermal ionizing source, although we cannot rule out shock excitation from a wind.\nThe spatially-resolved H\u03b1 line emission and the lower offnuclear [NII]/H\u03b1 ratio suggest a change to hot stars as the\ndominant source of ionizing photons outside the nucleus.\nThe observed [NII] 6583/H\u03b1 and [OIII] 5007/H\u03b2 line ratios for N4 are consistent with the average values found\nin low redshift ULIRGs with Lir > 2 \u00d7 1012 L\u2299 , albeit\nthere is a large range of ratios found for local ULIRGs\n(Veilleux et al. 1999). The limits on the [OI] 6300 and\n[SII] \u03bb\u03bb6716,6731 lines do not provide any additional constraints favoring one classification over another. Unfortunately, the [OI] 6300 line for N4 is redshifted to the wavelength of the Pa\u03b1 from the foreground galaxy. Although\nthere is tentative evidence for [OI] 6300 emission even after\ncareful galaxy subtraction, no robust measurement could\nbe derived for this line. The H\u03b1 equilvalent width (EQW)\nand relatively narrow line width suggest that N4 does not\ncontain a broad-line Type-I AGN, or that the broad-line\nregion is heavily obscured. A higher S/N spectrum would\nbe required to place more stringent limits on the H\u03b1 broadline flux from N4.\nThe only X-ray data that currently exists for N4 are\nfrom ROSAT, and these data are not sensitive enough to\nconstrain the fraction of the bolometric luminosity which\nmay arise from an AGN. Given the unknown contribution\nfrom a possible AGN and the uncertainty in the level of extinction, the star-formation rate (SFR) is fairly uncertain\nfor N4. We can derive upper and lower bounds on the SFR\nbased on the H\u03b1 and sub-mm emission. The off-nuclear\nH\u03b1 line luminosity uncorrected for extinction provides a\nlower-limit on the SFR in N4. At the observed resolution,\napproximately 40% of the total H\u03b1 emission is outside the\nnucleus. This off-nuclear H\u03b1 emission corresponds to a\nline luminosity of L(H\u03b1) = 2 \u00d7 108 L\u2299 , corrected for lensing. Adopting a standard relationship between the H\u03b1\nline luminosity and the SFR (Kennicutt 1983), we find\nthat SFR in N4 is greater than 6 M\u2299 yr\u22121 , uncorrected\nfor extinction. Unfortunately, the H\u03b2 limit is not sensitive enough to provide a useful estimate of the extinction\nlevel outside the nucleus. For comparison, the total H\u03b1\nline luminosity corrected for the extinction found from the\nlimit on the Balmer decrement would imply a total SFR\nof > 70 M\u2299 yr\u22121 .\nA upper-limit to the SFR can be derived by assuming\nthat all the far-infrared (FIR) radiation is due to starformation, neglecting any contribution due to a possible\nAGN. The FIR luminosity for N4 is derived assuming that\nits SED is somewhere between that of the infrared-warm\nULIRG Mrk 231 and the infrared-cool ULIRG Arp 220.\nPlacing these ULIRGs at the redshift of N4 and scaling\n\n\fFrayer et al.\nto the de-lensed 850\u03bcm flux of N4, we estimate an intrinsic FIR luminosity of L(FIR)=2\u20135\u00d71012 L\u2299 for N4.\nThis FIR luminosity corresponds to a SFR of massive\nstars of SFR(M> 5 M\u2299 ) \u2243200\u2013500 M\u2299 yr\u22121 , using the relationship given by Condon (1992). Including the presence\nof lower mass stars with the IMF adopted by Kennicutt\n(1983), we obtain a total SFR\u2243800\u20132000 M\u2299 yr\u22121 . Hence,\nfrom the H\u03b1 and sub-mm emission, the star-formation rate\nof N4 is probably at least 100 M\u2299 yr\u22121 and could be as\nlarge as 2000 M\u2299 yr\u22121 .\nDespite the high level of obscuration inferred for the submm galaxies, the recent Ly\u03b1 detections of radio-selected\nsub-mm sources by Chapman et al. (2003) suggest that\nsignificant rest-frame UV light can escape from the submm sources. For N4 we failed to detect Ly\u03b1 emission. The\nsensitivity of the ESI observations would have been sufficient to detect many of the Ly\u03b1 sources seen by Chapman\net al. (2003). However, given the fact that the Ly\u03b1/H\u03b1\nratio can span three orders of magnitudes for ULIRGs\n(< 0.01 \u2013 10; HST STIS observations by Surace et al. 2003,\nin preparation), the observed limit of Ly\u03b1/H\u03b1 < 0.14 for\nN4 is not particularly constraining.\nN4 has a composite spectrum consisting of a narrow-line\nAGN/LINER nucleus surrounded by a resolved starburst.\nOther well-studied sub-mm galaxies have shown a wide\nrange of characteristics. The system SMM J02399-0126 at\nz = 2.8 shows an AGN spectrum (Ivison et al. 1998) which\nhas been classified as broad absorption line QSO (Vernet &\nCimatti 2001), while SMM J14011+0252 at z = 2.6 shows\nno evidence of an AGN and is thought to be dominated\nby star formation (Barger et al. 1999; Ivison et al. 2000).\nThe most distant know sub-mm galaxy SMM J09431+4700\n(z = 3.3) contains a narrow-line Seyfert-1 AGN (Ledlow\net al. 2002), and the sub-mm galaxy N2 850.4 (z = 2.4)\nis a composite source (AGN+starburst) showing strong\noutflows and P-Cygni profiles indicative of stellar winds\n(Smail et al. 2003). All of these sub-mm galaxies are significantly more luminous than N4 and can be classified\n13\nas hyperluminous sources (L >\n\u223c 10 L\u2299 ). It may not be\nsurprising that most these of the hyperluminous sub-mm\nsources contain AGN given that this is seen at lower redshifts (e.g., Evans et al. 1998). The results for N4 suggest\nthat even the lower luminosity sub-mm sources could also\nbe partially powered by AGN.\nAlthough there is evidence for AGN in many sub-mm\nsources, the bulk of the infrared light for the high-redshift\n\n5\n\nsub-mm population is still thought to be dominated by\nstar-formation (Blain et al. 1999b, 2002). The X-ray data\nsupport this conclusion (Barger et al. 2001; Alexander et\nal. 2003; Almaini et al. 2003). The deepest X-ray data\nfrom Alexander et al. (2003) suggest that even though a\nsignificant faction of the bright sub-mm sources contain an\nAGN, the AGN typically have low luminosities and contribute negligibly to the total bolometric luminosity of the\npopulation.\nIn the local universe, the apparent fraction of AGN\ndominated ULIRGs increases at luminosities above Lir >\n2 \u00d7 1012 L\u2299 (Veilleux et al. 1999). It is unclear if the\nhigh-redshift sub-mm population of galaxies will follow\nthis trend. The relative importance of AGN and starformation activity in the sub-mm population will be constrained with future sensitive X-ray observations, SIRTF\nobservations that will distinguish between infrared warm\n(AGN) versus cool (starburst) sub-mm galaxies, and highresolution mm and CO interferometric observations that\nwill constrain gas masses and source sizes.\n5. CONCLUSIONS\n\nWe report the redshift of z = 2.51 for the counterpart\nof the sub-mm galaxy N4. We have detected the H\u03b1,\n[NII], and [OIII] lines and present upper-limits for Ly\u03b1,\nH\u03b2, and CO(3\u21922) lines. The line ratios and observed\nSED are consistent with the range of properties found in\nlocal ULIRGs. The data show that N4 is comprised of a\nnuclear region showing a LINER/Type-II AGN spectrum\nwith an extended H\u03b1 component, presumably arising from\nan extended starburst. It is still unclear whether N4 is predominately powered by AGN or star-forming activity. Future multi-wavelength observations should provide better\nconstraints on the source of its immense luminosity.\nWe thank the staff at Keck Observatory and the Owens\nValley Millimeter Array who have made these observations\npossible.

The slit location for the NIRSPEC spectroscopic observations is shown by the dotted\nlines. The grey-scale is plotted on a logarithmic scale, and the contour levels are separated by a factor of two in flux density, starting at the\n15\u03c3 level.\n\n\fFrayer et al.\n\nFig. 2.- The observed K-band spectrum of N4. The H\u03b1 and [NII] lines place N4 at a redshift of z = 2.5092. The spectrum has been\ncalibrated based on the K-band continuum level of N4 and has been smoothed by 26\u00c5. A small amount of residual Pa\u03b1 emission from the\nforeground galaxy (z = 0.18) remains after the subtraction of the wings of its continuum from the N4 data.\n\n9\n\n\f10\n\nThe z = 2.51 Submillimeter Galaxy SMM J04431+0210\n\nFig. 3.- The observed H-band spectrum of N4. The [OIII] 5007 line is detected, and only upper-limits can be derived at the location of\nthe redshifted H\u03b2 and [OIII] 4959 lines. The data have been smoothed by 25\u00c5.\n\n\fFrayer et al.\n\n11\n\nFig. 4.- The image of the K-band spectrum of N4. The H\u03b1 emission is spatially extended unlike the spatially unresolved [NII] 6583 line.\nThe extended H\u03b1 emission along with the observed line ratios suggests the association of bright star-forming regions around a central AGN\nand/or LINER nucleus. The contours for N4 start at 5\u03c3 and are incremented by 2\u03c3.\n\n\f12\n\nThe z = 2.51 Submillimeter Galaxy SMM J04431+0210\n\nFig. 5.- The K-band spectra of N4 extracted over different spatial regions smooth over 17\u00c5. The top spectrum shows the total spectrum\nover all emission regions. The middle spectrum shows the central nucleus, while the bottom spectrum represents off-nucleus emission. The\nvariation of the H\u03b1/[NII] ratio suggests that N4 is a composite system with active star formation off-nucleus. The dotted-line in the top\nspectrum shows the best fit model to the unsmoothed data for the H\u03b1+[NII] complex discussed in Sec. (3.1).\n\n\fFrayer et al.\n\n13\n\nFig. 6.- The K- and R-band images of N4 after the subtraction of the wings of the bright foreground galaxy. The cross shows the position\nof the K-band peak, and its size represents the uncertainty in registering the K- and R-band data. The logarithmic grey-scale is plotted from\n\u22123\u03c3 to +10\u03c3, and the contour levels start at 4\u03c3 and are incremented by 2\u03c3. Although the wings of the galaxy were removed, the alternating\nwhite and dark regions in the lower-left of the images are due to the over and under subtraction of the central disk, respectively.\n\n\f"}
