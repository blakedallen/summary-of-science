The hadronic properties at low energy have been successfully described by chiral effective models\nsuch as the linear sigma model [1], the Nambu\u2013Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model [2, 3], the chiral random matrix model\n[4], chiral perturbation theory [5] and so on. The nature of the chiral phase transition at finite temperature can be\nclassified by chiral symmetry according to the universality argument [6] and investigated in these effective models [7].\nIn particular, in the massless two-flavor case, we can expect a chiral phase transition of second-order that belongs to\nthe same universality class as the 3d O(4) spin model. Then, we can anticipate what could occur in the real world\nwith finite but sufficiently small (up and down) quark masses.\nThe deconfinement phase transition is rather obscure and veiled because it is only well-defined in the heavy quark\nlimit, which is too far from the real world. In the heavy quark limit, i.e., in the absence of dynamical quarks,\nthe Polyakov loop serves as an order parameter for deconfinement and the phase transition is characterized by the\nspontaneous breaking of center symmetry [8]. In the presence of dynamical quarks the center symmetry is explicitly\nbroken and no order parameter or criterion has been established for the deconfinement transition [9]. As mentioned\nabove, on the other hand, the chiral phase transition at high temperature or baryon density has been well-understood\nby means of effective models. Those model studies based on chiral symmetry, however, lack any dynamics coming\nfrom the Polyakov loop, except for some efforts to clarify the interplay between chiral dynamics and the Polyakov\nloop [10, 11, 12, 13, 14].\nIt is often argued that the mixing between the Polyakov loop, L, and the chiral order parameter (chiral condensate),\n\u03c7, can account for the lattice QCD observation that deconfinement and chiral restoration occur at the same pseudocritical temperature [15]. The mixing argument is, however, not sufficient to give a satisfactory explanation on the\nlattice QCD data. In the (T, mq ) plane (mq being the current quark mass), as discussed in [16], there appear two\nterminal points of the first-order phase boundary, namely, the critical end-points (CEPs). One is the chiral CEP\ndenoted by (TC , mCq ) and the other is the deconfinement CEP denoted by (TD , mD\nq ). For example, in the two-flavor\nC\nthree-color case, it is known that (TC \u223c 170 MeV, mq = 0) and (TD \u223c 270 MeV, mD\nq \u223c 1 GeV) [13, 17]. It should be\nnoted that the CEP is a true second-order critical point with a divergent susceptibility. Mixing means that L and \u03c7\nshould share the same singularity in their susceptibilities near the CEP; for mq = mCq (and mD\nq ), the susceptibilities\nof L and \u03c7 both diverge at T = TC (and TD respectively). The susceptibility peak is smeared as mq leaves from the\nCEP. The important point is that, with mq fixed at a certain value near the CEP, a smeared bump originating from\nthe other CEP may be observed separately as well as a sharp peak from the closer CEP. Thus the mixing argument\ncannot exclude a double-peak structure. For mq \u2243 mCq for example, the Polyakov loop susceptibility can have a sharp\npeak around TC (coming from the mixing with the diverging chiral susceptibility) as well as a broad bump around\nTD (coming from a remnant of deconfinement). We should be cautious about the mixing argument to understand the\nlattice QCD data in which no double-peak structure has been seen for any mq [15, 16].\nIn fact, the locking between the two crossover phenomena depends on the detailed properties of the interaction.\nThe purpose of this letter is to propose a simple mechanism to exclude the undesirable double-peak structure and to\ncomplement the shortcomings of the mixing argument.\nIdea To make our idea clear in general setting, let us suppose that we have a full effective potential, i.e.,\nVeff [L, \u03c7; mq ]. In principle, the behavior of L and \u03c7 should be completely determined by Veff [L, \u03c7; mq ]. Thus the\nquestion arises; what property of Veff [L, \u03c7; mq ] can give rise to the simultaneous crossovers? Our idea is as follows.\nFirst of all, an important property follows from the theoretical arguments given by Casher [18] and 't Hooft [19].\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\naddress: kenji@lns.mit.edu\n\n\f2\nAccording to their arguments, the confined phase must have a non-vanishing chiral condensate, which suggests that the\nchiral phase transition should occur at higher temperature than deconfinement. This means that Veff [L = 0, \u03c7; mq = 0]\nleads to \u03c7 6= 0 at any temperature if L = 0 is imposed by hand (or approximately chosen as a minimum of the effective\npotential). This property has not been proven in QCD (see also [20]) but is realized in the strong coupling analysis\n[13] and assumed here.\nNext, because L has turned out to behave approximately as an order parameter in lattice simulations [15], we\ncan expect that L is almost zero below the deconfinement crossover temperature, Td , regardless of dynamical quarks.\nThen, together with the above property, \u03c7 must have a non-vanishing value below Td even for mq \u223c 0 (i.e., spontaneous\nchiral symmetry breaking). Thus the chiral restoration temperature, T\u03c7 , is greater than or equal to Td .\nIn contrast, the critical temperatures at the CEPs are TD \u2243 270 MeV (for mq = \u221e) > TC \u2243 170 MeV (for mq = 0),\nwhich implies Td \u2265 T\u03c7 for an intermediate value of mq , unless chiral or center symmetry is overwhelmingly broken.\nOur idea is that Td = T\u03c7 is likely to be realized by T\u03c7 \u2265 Td from the properties of the effective potential and\nTd \u2265 T\u03c7 from, so to speak, the boundary condition. Chiral symmetry is broken by mq 6= 0, while the center symmetry\nbreaking is suppressed by the constituent quark mass even for small mq . Hence, our idea is expected to work especially\nfor mq \u223c 0. This mechanism can complement the mixing argument and lead to a robust single-peak structure in the\nsusceptibilities.\nEffective Model For the purpose of demonstrating our idea, we propose a simple chiral effective model with\nPolyakov loop dynamics. If the Polyakov gauge (A4 is static and diagonal) is employed, the Polyakov loop (or strictly\nspeaking its phase) appears in the quark action as an imaginary quark chemical potential [22, 23]. Thus we can\nuniquely determine the coupling between the Polyakov loop and quark excitations. We shall take this advantage by\nadopting the NJL model which is given in terms of quark degrees of freedom.\nThe conventional Lagrangian density of the NJL model is\n\u0001\nG\b\nLNJL = q\u0304 i\u03b3 \u03bc \u2202\u03bc \u2212 mq q +\n(q\u0304q)2 + (q\u0304i\u03b35~\u03c4 q)2 ,\n2\n\n(1)\n\nwhere mq = 5.5 MeV and G = 2 \u00d7 5.496 GeV\u22122 . The momentum integration is regulated by the cut-off \u039b = 631 MeV.\nThese model parameters are chosen as to reproduce the pion mass and decay constant at zero temperature [3]. In the\nmean field approximation the thermodynamic potential is given by\nZ\n\u0003o\n\u0003\n\u0002\n\u0002\nd3 p n\n1\n\u2212(Ep +\u03bc)/T\n\u2212(Ep \u2212\u03bc)/T\n2\n.\n(2)\n+\nT\nln\n1\n+\ne\nE\n+\nT\nln\n1\n+\ne\n(M \u2212 mq ) \u2212 2Nc Nf\n\u03a9NJL /V =\np\n2G\n(2\u03c0)3\nV is the spatial volume, Nf is the flavor number fixed as Nf = 2 throughout this letter, and \u03bc is the quark\npchemical\npotential. We neglect any \u03bc dependence in G as usual [3]. The energy of quasi-quarks is given by Ep = p2 + M 2\nwith the constituent quark mass M = mq \u2212 Ghq\u0304qi. The cut-off is imposed only on the first term in the curly brackets\n(zero-point energy) in the present analysis. The finite temperature contribution has a natural cut-off in itself specified\nby the temperature. Identifying the imaginary quark chemical potential with the Polyakov loop, we can define our\nmodel by the following thermodynamic potential,\n1\n\u03a9/V = Vglue [L] +\n(M \u2212 mq )2\n2G\nZ\ni\nio\nh\nh\n1\n1\nd3 p n\n\u2212(Ep \u2212\u03bc)/T\n\u2020 \u2212(Ep +\u03bc)/T\nE\n+\nT\n+\nT\n,\nTr\nln\n1\n+\nLe\nTr\nln\n1\n+\nL\ne\n\u2212 2Nc Nf\np\nc\nc\n(2\u03c0)3\nNc\nNc\nwhere the Polyakov loop is an SU(Nc ) matrix in color space explicitly given by\n\u0015\n\u0014 Z \u03b2\ndx4 A4 (x4 , ~x) .\nL(~x) = T exp \u2212i\n\n(3)\n\n(4)\n\n0\n\nThis coupling between the Polyakov loop and the chiral condensate can be derived also in the strong coupling approach\n[11, 13]. The generalization to aQCD (QCD with dynamical quarks in the adjoint representation in color space) is\nreadily available if one replaces the Polyakov loop by the Polyakov loop in the adjoint representation (c.f. [13]). In\nthis letter we will focus only on the case in the fundamental representation.\nSince the four-quark coupling constant, G, contains the information on gluons, G should depend on L. We simply\nneglect this possible L dependence. Nevertheless, this L dependence makes no qualitative difference because G\nincorporates all gluons and would not be much affected by L only, where L is essentially the temporal component of\ngluons. This approximation is acceptable in the same level as neglecting the possible \u03bc dependence in G.\nIt is worth noting that the NJL model with both quarks and the Polyakov loop is not incompatible with confinement\nat low temperature. To make this clear, let us assume that confinement corresponds to the condition, L = 0, though\n\n\f3\n30\n\n1\nPolyakov Loop\n\n4\n\nChiral Susceptibility\n\nOrder Parameters\n\nChiral Condensate\n\n0\n\n20\n\n2\n10\n\n0\n\n100\n\n200\nTemperature [MeV]\n\n300\n\nPolyakov Loop Susceptibility\n\nChiral\nPolyakov Loop\n\n0\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\nTemperature [MeV]\n\nFIG. 1: The left figure is the behavior of the traced Polyakov loop l and the chiral condensate \u03c7/\u03c70 (normalized by the value at\nT = 0) at \u03bc = 0. The dotted curves represent \u03c7/\u03c70 calculated from \u03a9NJL and l from Vglue . The right figure is the susceptibility.\n\nthis is not precise due to the center symmetry breaking. The Taylor expansion of the logarithmic terms generates\na series in powers of L whose power corresponds to the quark excitation number. L, L2 , L4 , . . . terms have nontrivial triality and break the center symmetry, while L3 , L\u2020 L(= 1), . . . terms have zero triality (color-singlet part)\ncorresponding to baryons, mesons, etc. In a more elaborated approximation scheme used in [9, 13], the group\nintegration of L with a vanishing mean-field, L = 0, singles out only the terms with zero triality. [Our notation is\nsloppy as long as no confusion arises. L is used for both the Polyakov loop matrix and its traced expectation value.]\nRoughly speaking, the limit of L = 0 allows only excitations with zero triality such as baryons and mesons. In the\npresent treatment the same argument holds in part (see (6)). Although our model (3) is described in terms of colored\nquarks, the thermal excitation must consist of colorless composites as long as L is small. Once L gets larger at higher\ntemperature, our model would reduce into the standard NJL model allowing thermal quark excitations.\nThe remaining part, Vglue [L], is the effective potential only in terms of the Polyakov loop. Here we shall adopt a\nsimple choice for Vglue [L] at the sacrifice of quantitative accuracy; we employ the leading order result of the strong\ncoupling expansion that is simple and yet reasonable qualitatively as compared with the lattice results [24]. This\npotential has only one parameter a (the lattice spacing). For Nc = 3 we can write it as\nh\ni\n\u00013\n2\n4\n2\nVglue [L] * a3 /T = \u22122(d \u2212 1) e\u2212\u03c3a/T Trc L \u2212 ln \u2212 Trc L + 8Re Trc L \u2212 18 Trc L + 27\n(5)\nwith the string tension \u03c3 = (425 MeV)2 . The first term comes from the kinetic part and the second term is just\nthe logarithm of the Haar measure associated with the SU(3) group integration. Vglue [L] leads to a first order phase\ntransition with the critical coupling 2(d \u2212 1)e\u2212\u03c3a/Td = 0.5153. We can fix the deconfinement transition temperature\nas the empirical value Td = 270 MeV by choosing a\u22121 = 272 MeV.\nApparently, the present model has two cut-offs, i.e., \u039b and a\u22121 . This means that the model has two independent\nscales for chiral symmetry breaking and confinement, or for mesons and the Polyakov loop. Since QCD has only one\nscale, \u039b and a\u22121 should be related to each other in principle. Here we simply fix them as model parameters since we\nare working in the effective model to abstract the essence for each dynamics [21].\nNumerical Results Before we refer numerical calculations in the Nc = 3 case, let us introduce an ansatz\nto simplify the analysis. In the Polyakov gauge we can parametrize the SU(3) Polyakov loop matrix as L =\n\u2032\n\u2032\ndiag(ei\u03c6 , ei\u03c6 , e\u2212i(\u03c6+\u03c6 ) ). The perturbative vacuum has \u03c6 = \u03c6\u2032 = 0 and we can choose the confining vacuum at\n\u03c6 = 2\u03c0/3, \u03c6\u2032 = 0 [22]. Thus we shall fix \u03c6\u2032 = 0 from the beginning for simplicity. Once this ansatz is accepted, we\ncan rewrite the potential (3) only in terms of the traced Polyakov loop, i.e. l = (Trc L)/Nc = (1 + 2 cos \u03c6)/3. After\nstraightforward calculations we can reach the expression;\ni\nh\ni\nh\nTrc ln 1 + Le\u2212(Ep \u2212\u03bc)/T + Trc ln 1 + L\u2020 e\u2212(Ep +\u03bc)/T\ni\ni\nh\nh\n= ln 1 + (3 l \u2212 1)e\u2212(Ep \u2212\u03bc)/T + e\u22122(Ep \u2212\u03bc)/T + ln 1 + (3 l \u2212 1)e\u2212(Ep +\u03bc)/T + e\u22122(Ep +\u03bc)/T\ni\ni h\nh\n(6)\n+ ln 1 + e\u2212(Ep \u2212\u03bc)/T ln 1 + e\u2212(Ep +\u03bc)/T .\n\n\f4\n30\n\n1\n\nPolyakov Loop\n6\n\nChiral\nChiral Susceptibility\n\nOrder Parameters\n\n20\n4\n\n10\n2\n\nPolyakov Loop Susceptibility\n\nChiral Condensate\n\nPolyakov Loop\n\n0\n\n0\n\n100\n\n200\n\n0\n\n300\n\n100\n\nTemperature [MeV]\n\n200\n\n300\n\nTemperature [MeV]\n\nFIG. 2: The order parameter and susceptibility around the chiral critical end-point with \u03bcE = 321 MeV.\n\nWhen l = 1, the model is reduced into the standard two-flavor NJL model having the chiral phase transition at\nT\u03c7 = 175 MeV in the chiral limit. If l is forced to be zero by hand, the temperature effect is so suppressed that\nspontaneous chiral symmetry breaking can sustain until T\u03c7 \u2243 520 MeV, that is much higher than TD . Therefore the\nchiral phase transition cannot occur until the Polyakov loop jumps from nearly zero to a certain finite value. Our\nmodel (3) satisfies the essential assumption in our idea, T\u03c7 \u2265 Td , for mq \u223c 0.\nFigure 1 (left) shows the resulting behavior of order parameters as functions of temperature at \u03bc = 0. To see\nthe simultaneous crossovers clearly the chiral condensate \u03c7 = hq\u0304qi is normalized by the value at T = 0 (denoted by\n\u03c70 ). The results from \u03a9 are represented by the solid (for \u03c7/\u03c70 ) and dashed (for l) curves. The dotted curves are\nthe results from \u03a9NJL and Vglue without any interaction between \u03c7 and l for reference. It should be noted that the\nmixing interaction between \u03c7 and l vanishes at zero temperature in this model. Consequently the normalization \u03c70\nis identical for both the chiral condensates from \u03a9 and \u03a9NJL .\nIn the presence of dynamical quarks, as seen from the figure, the Polyakov loop shows a crossover around the\npseudo-critical temperature Tc \u2243 200 MeV. At the same time the chiral condensate is affected by the Polyakov loop\nsuch that it tends to be almost constant as long as T < Tc . The pseudo-critical temperature can be read from the peak\nposition of each susceptibility. Here we shall define the dimensionless susceptibility of the chiral order parameter and\nthe Polyakov loop by using the curvature inferred from the potential (3). First, we define the dimensionless curvature\nmatrix C by\nCqq =\n\n\u039b2 \u2202 2 \u03b2\u03a9\n,\n\u2202M 2 \u039b3 V\n\nCll =\n\n\u2202 2 \u03b2\u03a9\n,\n\u2202l2 \u039b3 V\n\nCql = Clq =\n\n\u039b\u2202 2 \u03b2\u03a9\n.\n\u2202M \u2202l \u039b3 V\n\n(7)\n\n\u22121\nRoughly speaking, Cqq\n(Cll\u22121 ) corresponds to the chiral (Polyakov loop) fluctuation and Cql is the interaction vertex\nof a quark and the Polyakov loop. Then, the susceptibility is given by the inverse of C;\n\n\u03c7q = C \u22121\n\n\u0001\n\nqq\n\n=\n\nCll\n2 ,\nCqq Cll \u2212 Cql\n\n\u03c7l = C \u22121\n\n\u0001\n\nll\n\n=\n\nCqq\n2 .\nCqq Cll \u2212 Cql\n\n(8)\n\nThe physical meaning of the above equations is transparent if we notice that the fraction can be expanded as \u03c7q =\n\u22121\n\u22121\n\u22121\nCqq\n+ Cqq\nCql Cll\u22121 Clq Cqq\n+ * * * , that is the sum over mixing contributions. The mixing pattern is similar to the\nrelation between the chiral susceptibility and the baryon number susceptibility [25, 26]. As shown in Fig. 1 (right),\nour idea works pretty well so that the peak of the Polyakov loop susceptibility can be found just near the peak of the\nchiral susceptibility, though perfect coincidence is not reached.\nWhen the quark chemical potential, \u03bc, becomes larger, the Polyakov loop shows a crossover with smoother slope\nbecause the density effect itself breaks the center symmetry explicitly. It is widely accepted that the chiral phase\ntransition becomes of first-order at large \u03bc. In the (\u03bc, T ) plane, therefore, we can expect another CEP [27, 28].\nActually we found the CEP at (\u03bcE = 321 MeV, TE = 106 MeV), which is close to the value originally obtained in [27].\nThe order parameter and the susceptibility around this CEP are shown in Fig. 2.\nAt \u03bc = 0, as discussed in Introduction, the deconfinement CEP is important as well as the chiral CEP. [In the present\ntwo-flavor case the chiral CEP trivially lies at mq = 0.] We found the deconfinement CEP at (mD\nq = 788 MeV, TD =\n257 MeV) in our model. This value is consistent with the lattice observation in the two-flavor case [17] and also\n\n\f5\n3\n\n1\nChiral Condensate\n\nChiral Susceptibility\n\nOrder Parameters\n\nPolyakov Loop\n\n2\n\n20\n\n1\n\n0\n\nChiral\n\nPolyakov Loop Susceptibility\n\n40\n\nPolyakov Loop\n0\n\n100\n\n200\nTemperature [MeV]\n\n300\n\n240\n\n260\nTemperature [MeV]\n\nFIG. 3: The order parameter and susceptibility around the deconfinement critical end-point with mD\nq = 788 MeV and \u03bc = 0 MeV.\n\nin good agreement with the Gocksch-Ogilvie model [13]. The order parameter and the susceptibility around the\ndeconfinement CEP are shown in Fig. 3. Since the deconfinement transition is of second-order, the Polyakov loop\nsusceptibility diverges at T = TD . In Figs. 2 and 3 we can see that the chiral susceptibility and the Polyakov loop\nsusceptibility both have a singularity due to the mixing.\nDiscussion We shall briefly summarize characteristic features of our model defined by Eqs. (3) and (6) below.\n1. The coupling between the Polyakov loop and the chiral condensate is determined uniquely and is consistent with\nthe conventional form; in the leading order of the hopping parameter (\u03ba) expansion on the lattice, the coupling\nterm takes the form of (2\u03ba)N\u03c4 l \u223c l e\u2212M/T [10, 29] (see the coupling term of (3)).\n2. Because the coupling term is \u223c l e\u2212M/T , it goes to zero as T \u2192 0. Actually the zero temperature system can\nbe different from the system at infinitesimally small but finite temperature. At zero temperature, the canonical\ndescription with the quark triality fixed at zero is likely to be valid [9].\n3. Contrary to naive expectation, the Polyakov loop behavior hardly reflects the singularity associated with the\nchiral phase transition of second-order. [The gross feature of Fig. 1 is hardly changed when mq = 0 except that\n\u03c7q 's peak becomes divergent.] This is because the coupling Cql (amplitude between the Polyakov loop and the\nchiral condensate) is proportional to the constituent quark mass, M , and vanishes at the chiral phase transition\nof second-order. Nevertheless, our idea leads to the almost simultaneous crossovers in a robust way.\n4. Figure 2 is an interesting prediction from our model at finite density. Our idea would not necessarily give the\nsimultaneous crossovers at high density where TE is too lower than TD and the Polyakov loop has a long tail.\nThis double-peak structure with a sharp peak and a broad bump would be a realistic possibility to be seen in\nthe future lattice simulation at high density.\n5. As discussed in the section \"Idea\", our idea would not work for large mq because of explicit symmetry breaking.\nIn general the pseudo-critical temperature T\u03c7 gets larger with increasing mq . Actually the chiral susceptibility\npeak calculated in the standard NJL model yields T\u03c7 = 270 MeV(\u223c TD ) at mq = 167 MeV. For mq > 167 MeV,\nour model leads to a double-peak structure with Td < T\u03c7 , that is not prohibited by our dynamical mechanism.\nThe chiral susceptibility in Fig. 3 has a second broad bump at much higher temperature than shown in the\nfigure. Although the present model embodies our idea and describes the simultaneous crossovers for small mq ,\nthere must be some further constraints, in particular to impose Td \u2265 T\u03c7 . Such a condition would realize a\nperfect locking for small mq and cure the failure for larger mq .\nSummary We proposed an idea to realize the simultaneous crossovers of deconfinement and chiral restoration,\nwhich turned out to work well for small quark mass. We demonstrated the idea by using a chiral effective model with\nthe Polyakov loop. The model study yields the chiral CEP at (\u03bcE = 321 MeV, TE = 106 MeV) and the deconfinement\nCEP at (mD\nq = 788 MeV, TD = 257 MeV). The Polyakov loop susceptibility and the chiral susceptibility both diverge\nat the CEP due to the mixing effect.\nSince the thermodynamic potential in our model is a function of M 2 (M being the constituent quark mass), the\nmixing effect \u221d M is small at T = TC . Then our idea plays an essential role to attract one crossover to the other.\n\n\f6\nAlso we presented a prediction from our model at finite baryon density. At sufficiently high density we can expect\nthat the Polyakov loop has a double-peak structure with a sharp peak from the mixing and a broad bump from a\nremnant of deconfinement.\nThe present model lacks some mechanism necessary to sustain the locking for mq > 167 MeV. In other words, this\nresult suggests that some dynamical mechanism is further needed in order that the chiral and deconfinement CEPs\nare connected by a single crossover line [16]. The scenario of [16] requires something beyond the mixing argument\nand the present idea to lock two phenomena. Although this is still an open question, we believe that our model can\ncontain correct physics at least for small mq and can be a simple starting point to examine the underlying relation\nbetween deconfinement and chiral restoration not only at finite temperature but at finite baryon density also.\nAcknowledgments The author, who is supported by Research Fellowships of the Japan Society for the Promotion\nof Science for Young Scientists, thanks R.D.
