In this paper, we\nmodel covering and packing problems as games, and we use models from learning theory to describe local\ndecision making by players in these games. As opposed to previous work, we are interested in demonstrating\nconvergence not to arbitrary local equilibria but to states that are low cost relative to the global optimum.\nWe accomplish this by incorporating a globally-informed central authority into natural behavior dynamics.\n\u2217\n\nSchool of Computer Science, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta GA 30332.

Given a universe of elements with associated costs and a collection of sets of these elements, the\nminimum weighted set cover optimization problem is to choose the lowest cost subset of elements such that\neach set is represented by at least one chosen element. While this problem is NP-hard, good approximation\nalgorithms exist. However, such algorithms tend to be centralized in nature and require global knowledge.\nGame. We analyze a setting in which a central authority knows a good approximation, but elements are\nmodeled as only locally aware agents with cost functions representing a natural distributed game interpretation of the core optimization problem. We generalize the problem by not requiring total coverage, rather\nthe importance of covering a given set is determined by its set weight. Each element i that chooses to be\non incurs his own cost ci , and each element i that is off pays the sum of the weights of sets he participates\nin that do not contain any other on element. If the element costs are all smaller than the set weights, then\nthe cost-minimizing set of on elements is also the optimal set cover. If additionally each set is of size two,\nthen this is the special case of a minimum weighted vertex cover problem. By simply redefining the cost\nstructure so that i pays ci if he is off and the sum of weights of fully-covered sets he participates in if he is\non, we can interpret this new game as a packing problem with maximum independent set as a special case.\nSocial and engineering applications. Our motivation for this game theoretic approach is two-fold. The\nfirst setting is a social one in which agents have inherent costs associated with being on or off that correlate\nwith the social objective. As a concrete example, suppose government wishes to set up a network of offices,\nsay homeless shelters, that perform some service to the local community. Society would like the lowest\ncost solution that adequately addresses the needs of most communities, but for political reasons it may not\nbe possible to enforce an optimal solution in a top-down manner. Furthermore, individual counties have\ncompeting interests in that they desire their own area to be served but incur some cost by opening a shelter.\nAnother motivation is the setting in which non-autonomous agents are programmed to make decisions\nbased on their surroundings. The extensive literature on cooperative control has shown that in this setting\nmany optimization problems can be conveniently solved in a distributed fashion by endowing agents with\nartificial individual objective functions and cost-minimizing behavior. Many of these games and dynamics\nmodels result in convergence to a Nash equilibrium, or local optimum. In particular, several papers have\nmodeled sensor networks as a special case of our set cover game. The elements are autonomous sensors,\nand a geographic region is a set consisting of elements corresponding to sensors that could cover that region.\nA sensor that is on is charged some fixed cost, whereas a sensor that is off is charged a cost proportional to\nthe number or importance of its adjacent regions that are uncovered by any other sensor. This application\nis particularly well-suited for cooperative control because sensors can only observe the behavior of other\nsensors in their neighborhoods, and the structure of the network may not be known ahead of time, making it\nimpossible for a central designer to program the sensors with an optimal solution.\nEquilibrium quality and dynamics models. Much of the work on cooperative control and dynamicsbased algorithmic game theory only guarantees that systems converge to some equilibrium. Many games,\nhowever, have a high Price of Anarchy (PoA), where PoA means the worst case ratio between the social\ncost in an equilibrium and that of the global optimal configuration (see Section 2.1 for its formal definition).\nThe following special case illustrates that PoA is \u03a9(n) in our set cover game. Suppose n agents (or players)\nare charged some amount c < 1 when they are on and otherwise penalized 1 for every incident uncovered\nset. Then a star graph in which vertices are agents and edges are sets has a global optimum with only the\ncenter on, yielding social cost c, compared to a low quality Nash Equilibrium in which only the center is off,\nyielding social cost c(n \u2212 1).\nThe more general problem of dynamics for games with high PoA is addressed in [1, 2], in which authors\npropose three models of distributed and semi-selfish social behavior in a general repeated game setting.\n2\n\n\fThe models share the common feature that a central authority has knowledge of some joint strategy profile\nwith low social cost, and this authority broadcasts this strategy in the hopes that players will adopt their\nprescribed strategies. Specifically, the public service advertising model (PSA) of [1] assumes that each\nagent independently has an \u03b1 probability of receiving and temporarily adopting the advertising strategy.\nThose that do not receive and adopt their prescribed strategy behave in a myopic best response manner. This\nmodel is well-suited for an engineering systems setting, where we do not expect all components to receive\nthe central authority's signal. The learning models of [2] assume that each agent uses any of a broad class\nof learning algorithms to continually choose between acting according to their local best response move and\ntheir broadcasted signal. In the learn-then-decide (LTD) model, agents eventually commit to one of these\noptions. These models are better motivated by a social setting where agents that are only locally aware are\ninterested in exploring the advertising strategy with the hopes that it will benefit them personally. These\npapers provide high quality guarantees for particular games, including fair cost-sharing and party affiliation\ngames.\nOur results. The positive theoretical guarantees about social welfare in the outcomes of the games studied\nin the advertising and learning models of [1, 2] serve as motivation to use these models in studying our\ngeneral general classes of set cover and packing games, which apply to engineering systems applications\nsuch as sensor networks as well as more purely game theoretic settings. For the case where costs of agents\nand weights of sets are bounded below and above by constants, we show the following:\nR1. In vertex cover games1 , we show that for any advertising strategy sad ,\nthe dynamics of agents converges to a state of expected cost O(cost(sad )) in PSA and LTD models.\nR2. In set cover games, we show that for any advertising strategy sad ,\n(\nO(\u22062 * cost(sad )2 ) in PSA model\n,\nthe dynamics of agents converges to a state of expected cost\nO(\u220622 * cost(sad )2 ) in LTD model\nwhere \u22062 is the maximum number of sets containing given two agents.\nR3. In set cover games, we show that for a specific advertising strategy sad ,\nthe dynamics of agents converge to a state of cost O(cost(sad )) with high probability in PSA model.\nMoreover, we present a poly-time algorithm to find such a specific sad of low cost, i.e.\ncost(sad ) = O(\u22062 log n * OP T ),\n\nwhere OP T is the optimal (social) cost.\n\nFurthermore, we emphasize that all the above convergence guarantees happen in polynomial number\nof steps in terms of the number of agents. As we mentioned earlier, without such advertising strategies,\nagents can be an inefficient equilibrium state of cost \u03a9(n) * OP T , even restricted to vertex cover games\n(i.e. \u22062 = 1). We also discuss extensions to the case where the costs of agents and weights of sets are not\nbounded below or above by constants.\n1\n\nAs mentioned earlier, a set cover game where each set has size 2 is called a vertex cover game, and in such games equilibria\nhave natural connections to vertex covers in the graph induced by the sets (i.e. edges).\n\n3\n\n\fRelated work. Achieving global coordination in distributed multi-agent systems is a central problem of\ncontrol theory with multiple real-world applications (see [16] and references therein). More specifically,\nseveral papers consider game theoretic formulations of covering problems which are inspired by practical\nsensor network problems [15, 11, 14, 3]. In particular, [3] analyzes a game that is a specific case of the problem addressed in this paper. However, [3] and many other control theory papers guarantee only convergence\nto stable states which are locally optimal. Since these games often have a high Price of Anarchy [10, 13],\nthe results do not translate to global performance guarantees.\nA number of approaches have been explored to circumvent such bad PoA results. In [17] the authors\nassume that the authorities enjoy complete control over some fraction of the agents. Similarly, [6, 7] focus\non the problem of identifying and controlling the influential nodes of a network. While we also use a special\ntype of advertising for improved results in Theorem 4, we do not require particular control over certain\nagents. Rather, the models we use from [1, 2] incorporate strategic behavior for all agents. Another line of\nresearch offers stronger performance guarantees using specific learning algorithms that employ equilibrium\nselection [9, 4, 5] or cyclic behavior [8]. Unfortunately, these techniques do not yield guarantees of fast\nconvergence to good states in our class of games.\nOur analysis builds on the works of [1, 2], in which authors propose game theoretic models of distributed\nand semi-selfish social behavior in a general repeated game setting. The models share the common feature\nthat a central authority has knowledge of some joint strategy profile with low social cost, and this authority\nbroadcasts this strategy in the hopes that players will adopt their prescribed strategies. These papers provide\nquality guarantees for particular games, including fair cost-sharing and party affiliation games. By using\nthese models, we do not have to make the hard choice between enforcing top-down solutions (which may\nbe infeasible in both engineering systems and social settings) and poor performance guarantees. Instead,\nwe show that for a broad class of covering and packing problems, incorporating mild influence from a weak\ncentral authority guides the system into a near-optimal state when agents are only optimizing locally.\n\n2 Preliminaries\n2.1 Background on General Games\nWe represent a general game as a triple G = hN, (Si ), (costi )i, where N is a set of n players, Si is the\nfinite action space of player i \u2208 N , and costi denotes the cost function of player i. The joint action space\nof the players is S = S1 \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 Sn . For a joint action s \u2208 S, we denote by s\u2212i the actions of all players\nj 6= i. Players' cost functions map joint actions to non-negative real numbers, i.e. costi : S \u2192 R+ for\nall i \u2208 N . In this paper, we define a social cost function, cost : S \u2192 R, simply as the summation of\nindividual players' costs. The optimal social cost is denoted by\nOP T = min cost(s).\ns\u2208S\n\nGiven a joint action s, the best response of player i is the set of actions that minimizes player i's cost\nsubject to the other players' fixed actions s\u2212i , i.e.\nBRi (s\u2212i ) = arg mina\u2208Si costi (a, s\u2212i ).\nBest response dynamics is a process in which at each time step, an arbitrary player not already playing best\nresponse updates his action to one in his current best response set. A joint action s \u2208 S is a pure Nash\nequilibrium if no player i \u2208 N can benefit from deviating to another action, namely, si \u2208 BRi (s\u2212i ) for\nevery i \u2208 N .\nA game G is called an exact potential game [12] if there exists a potential function \u03a6 : S \u2192 R such that\ncosti (a\u2032 , s\u2212i ) \u2212 costi (a, s\u2212i ) = \u03a6(a\u2032 , s\u2212i ) \u2212 \u03a6(a, s\u2212i ),\n4\n\n\ffor all i \u2208 N , s\u2212i \u2208 S\u2212i , and a, a\u2032 \u2208 Si . For general potential games, only the signs of both sides of these\nequations must be equal. While general games are not guaranteed to have a pure Nash equilibrium, all finite\npotential games do and furthermore best response dynamics in such games always converges to a pure Nash\nequilibrium [12, 13]. However, the convergence time can be exponentially large in terms of the number of\nplayers in general.\nTwo well known concepts for quantifying the inefficiency of equilibria relative to non-equilibria are\nPrice of Anarchy and Price of Stability. For N (G) the set of pure Nash equilibria of game G, Price of\nAnarchy (PoA) and Price of Stability (PoS) are defined as\ncost(s)\n.\ns\u2208N (G) OP T\n\ncost(s)\ns\u2208N (G) OP T\n\nPoS = min\n\nPoA = max\n\n2.2 Covering Game\nGiven agents [n] = {1, 2, . . . , n}, a collection of sets F \u2286 2[n] , costs ci for i \u2208 [n], and weights w\u03c3 for\n\u03c3 \u2208 F, we describe the covering game G = h[n], (Si ), (costi )i where actions Si = {on, off } and cost\ncosti as defined in (1) for every agent i \u2208 [n]. We let \u2206k be the 'k-th order' maximum degree of the\nhypergraph induced by sets. Namely,\n\u2206k = \u2206k (G) :=\n\nmax\n\ni1 ,...,ik \u2208[n]\n\n|{\u03c3 \u2208 F : {i1 , . . . , ik } \u2282 \u03c3, ii 6= ij , \u2200i 6= j}| .\n\nIn addition, we define\ncmax := max ci\ni\u2208[n]\n\ncmin := min ci\ni\u2208[n]\n\nwmax := max w\u03c3\n\u03c3\u2208F\n\nwmin := min w\u03c3 .\n\u03c3\u2208F\n\nBefore defining the cost functions, we introduce some notation. We say a set \u03c3 \u2208 F is 'covered' in\njoint strategy s if si = on for some i \u2208 \u03c3. Otherwise, \u03c3 is said to be 'uncovered'. Denote the collection\nof sets that include agent i and are uncovered in sSwith Fiu (s), or simply Fiu when s is clear\nP from context.\nThe entire set of uncovered sets is written F u = i\u2208[n] Fiu . For \u03c3 \u2286 [n], define c(\u03c3) := i\u2208\u03c3 ci , and for\nP\nF \u2032 \u2286 F, define w(F \u2032 ) := \u03c3\u2208F \u2032 w\u03c3 . Now define the cost function of agent i is defined with respect to any\njoint strategy s \u2208 S as follows:\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f2 ci\nif si = on\ncosti (s) =\n(1)\n\uf8f3w(Fiu ) if si = off .\n\nObserve that ci expresses how much agent i prefers to cover the sets containing i. For example, if cmax <\nwmin , then each agent prefers to avoid the situation that there exists an uncovered sets containing her. As\nwe explain in Section 5, these covering games can be interpreted as equivalent packing games.\nFor a joint action (or strategy profile) s \u2208 S, let ON(s) and OFF(s) be sets of nodes that are on and off,\nrespectively. It is easy to check that the social cost has the following simple form:\nX\nX\ncost(s) =\ncosti (s) = c(ON(s)) +\n|\u03c3| * w(\u03c3).\n(2)\n\u03c3\u2208F u (s)\n\ni\u2208[n]\n\nBest response convergence. Recall that best response dynamics converge to pure Nash equilibria for\npotential games. Now observe that the covering game is an exact potential game with potential function\n\u03a6(s) = c (ON(s)) + w(F u (s)).\n\n(3)\n\nCombining this observation with the social cost formula implies that for any s \u2208 S we have\n\u03a6(s) \u2264 cost(s) \u2264 Fmax * \u03a6(s),\nwhere we let Fmax be the size of the largest set i.e. Fmax = max\u03c3\u2208F |\u03c3|.\n5\n\n(4)\n\n\fOptimization and equilibrium quality. The star graph example from the introduction reveals that PoA\nin the covering game can be very large. More generally, certain covering game instances exist with PoA\n\u03a9 (n) even restricted to the simple case \u22062 = 1.2 This motivates the need for efficient dynamics with better\nguarantees than convergence to arbitrary equilibria.\nAs a step in that direction, here we provide a centralized LP-rounding-based poly-time algorithm to find\na low-cost configuration sad for the covering game as follows.\n1. Solve the following Linear Programming (LP), and obtain the solution x\u2217 .\nminimize\n\nn\nX\n\nci * xi\n\nsubject to\n\ni=1\n\n(\nsad\ni = on\n2. Set\nsad\ni = off\n\nX\n\nxi \u2265 1 \u2200\u03c3 \u2208 F, xi \u2208 [0, 1]\n\n(5)\n\ni\u2208\u03c3\n\nif x\u2217i \u2265 1/Fmax\n.\notherwise\n\nThe following lemma proves that the algorithm is a Fmax \u2308cmax /wmin \u2309-approximation one for minimizing\nthe social cost (2).\nLemma 1. The configuration sad obtained from the algorithm has\ncost(sad ) \u2264 Fmax \u2308cmax /wmin \u2309 * OP T,\nwhere we recall that OP T = mins cost(s).\nProof. Let s\u2217 be the optimal configuration i.e. cost(s\u2217 ) = OP T . If there exists a uncovered set \u03c3 under the\nconfiguration s\u2217 , choose one element from \u03c3 and force it to be turned on. Repeat this procedure until all sets\nare covered, and say s\u2020 be the resulting configuration. Now observe that cost(s\u2020 ) \u2264 \u2308cmax /wmin \u2309 * OP T .\nTherefore, it follows that\nX\ncost(sad ) \u2264 Fmax *\nci * xi \u2264 Fmax * cost(s\u2020 ) \u2264 Fmax \u2308cmax /wmin \u2309 * OP T.\ni\n\nUnder the assumption (6), this is an O(Fmax )*OP T -approximation algorithm to the optimal social cost.\n\n3 Public Service Advertising\nIn this section and the following one, we show that price of anarchy is avoidable in covering games even\nusing best response-inspired dynamics as long as these dynamics incorporate some form of suggestion from\na weak central authority that is aware of a high quality equilibrium.\nThe first model we study in this paper is the public service advertising (PSA) model in [1] in which a\ncentral authority broadcasts a strategy for each agent, which some agents receive and temporarily follow.\nPlayer behavior is described in two phases:\n2\nFor example, let ci = c for all i \u2208 [n] and let w\u03c3 = 1 for all \u03c3 \u2208 F. Label an arbitrary set of \u2308c\u2309 elements L, and label the\nother elements R. Define F to be all sets with one element in L and one in R. It is straightforward to check that the solution with\nall L on and all R off is a Nash equilibrium with cost c * \u2308c\u2309, while the solution with all L off and all R on is a Nash equilibrium\nwith cost c * (n \u2212 \u2308c\u2309).\n\n6\n\n\f1: Play begins in an arbitrary state, and a central authority advertises joint action sad \u2208 S. Each agent\nreceives the proposed strategy independently with probability \u03b1 \u2208 (0, 1). Agents that receive this\nsignal are called receptive. Receptive agents play their advertising strategies throughout Phase 1,\nand non-receptive agents undergo best response dynamics to settle on a joint strategy that is a Nash\nequilibrium given the fixed behavior of receptive agents. We call this joint strategy s\u2032 .\n2: All agents participate in best response dynamics until convergence to some Nash equilibrium s\u2032\u2032 .\nSince our covering game is a potential game and all potential games eventually converge to a Nash equilibrium under best response dynamics, both phases are guaranteed to terminate. Furthermore, convergence\noccurs in poly-time with respect to parameters {n, c1 , . . . , cn , w(\u03c3) : \u03c3 \u2208 F}.3\n\n3.1 Effect of Advertising in PSA\nIn this section we show that advertising helps significantly in covering games. In particular, we show that\nif the advertising strategy sad has low social cost, then the cost of the resulting equilibrium is low even if\nonly a small constant \u03b1 fraction of the agents receive and respond to the signal. Theorem 2 formalizes the\ngeneral result of this section, and Theorem 4 improves this result for particular advertising strategies. For\nthe convenience, in this section we assume costs and weights are bounded above and below, i.e.\ncmax := max ci = O(1)\ni\u2208[n]\n\ncmin := min ci = \u03c9(1) wmax := max w\u03c3 = O(1)\n\u03c3\u2208F\n\ni\u2208[n]\n\nwmin := min w\u03c3 = \u03c9(1).\n\u03c3\u2208F\n\n(6)\nTheorem 2. For any advertising strategy sad in the PSA model,\n(\nO(1) * cost(sad )\nif Fmax = 2\n.\nE[cost(s\u2032\u2032 )] \u2264\nad 2\nO(\u22062 ) * cost(s ) if Fmax = O(1)\n\n(7)\n\nTheorem 2 implies that if sad is obtained from the O(Fmax )-approximation poly-time algorithm described in Section 2.2, the following corollary holds.\nCorollary 3. There exists a poly-time algorithm to find an advertising strategy sad for the PSA model such\nthat\n(\nO(1) * OP T\nif Fmax = 2\n\u2032\u2032\n.\nE[cost(s )] \u2264\n2\nO(\u22062 ) * OP T\nif Fmax = O(1)\nEffective advertising. We additionally consider advertising strategies particular to our game for improved\nperformance of the model. We say that advertising strategy sad satisfies condition (\u22c6) if\n\u0016\n\u0017\n\u0001x\u2212\u230acmax /wmin \u230b\ncmax\n\u2206\u22171\n1\nfor all x \u2265\n,\n(\u22c6)\n\u2264 2,\nx\u230acmax /wmin \u230b 1 \u2212 \u03b1Fmax\nwmin\nn\n\u22062 (Fmax \u2212 1)\n\nwhere \u2206\u22171 := \u2206\u22171 (sad ) is the smallest number of sets containing a given on element in sad as the unique\non element. We say \u2206\u22171 is the 'core' minimum degree of on elements in sad . Intuitively, the condition (\u22c6)\nmeans that each on element in the advertising strategy sad 'solely' contributes a large number of sets to\ncover. We establish the following stronger theorem which implies that agents will reach a state of social cost\nO(cost(sad )) at the end of Phase 2 if sad satisfied the condition (\u22c6).\n3\n\nThis is because \u03a6 is bounded above and below by functions of these parameters and decreases under best response dynamics.\n\n7\n\n\fTheorem 4. For an advertising strategy sad satisfying the condition (\u22c6) in the PSA model,\ncost(s\u2032\u2032 ) = O(1) * cost(sad )\n\nwith probability 1 \u2212\n\n1\n,\nn\n\nif Fmax = O(1).\n\nThe following corollary implies that it is possible to find such an advertising strategy sad of low cost.\nCorollary 5. There exists a poly-time algorithm to find an advertising strategy sad for the PSA model such\nthat\n1\ncost(s\u2032\u2032 ) = O(\u22062 log n) * OP T\nwith probability 1 \u2212 ,\nif Fmax = O(1).\nn\nProof. Here we explain how to find an advertising strategy sad satisfying the condition (\u22c6) as well as being\nof low cost. Observe that any joint strategy s with \u2206\u22171 = \u2206\u22171 (s) \u2265 B\u22062 log n for a large enough constant\nB (depending on constants cmax /wmin , \u03b1, Fmax ) satisfies the condition (\u22c6). Then starting from the joint\nstrategy with social cost O(1)*OP T obtained from the algorithm in Section 2.2, one can greedily construct a\njoint strategy sad satisfying the condition (\u22c6) with social cost O(\u22062 log n)*OP T (greedily turning off every\nagent that is the unique on element in fewer than B\u22062 log n sets). For the advertising strategy sad satisfying\nthe condition (\u22c6) as constructed above, the conclusion of Corollary 5 follows from Theorem 4.\n\nProof of Theorem 2\nFrom (4) and Fmax = O(1), any sequence of best response moves increases social cost by at most a constant\nfactor. All agents best respond in Phase 2, and hence cost(s\u2032\u2032 ) = O(cost(s\u2032 )). It suffices to bound\ncost(s\u2032 ). At a high level, we do this by providing a bound (i.e. Lemma 6) on the total weight of uncovered\nsets that are not uncovered in sad and then we give a bound (i.e. Lemma 7) on the number of agents that are\noff in sad but on at the end of Phase 1.\nFirst, let us introduce some notation. We say two agents contained in a common set are neighbors. Let\nL and R denote the set of agents that are on and off in sad , respectively. Let Loff (and Ron ) denotes the set of\nagents in L (and R), who are off (and on) in s\u2032 . Let FR denote the collection of sets uncovered in sad , and\nlet Fbad denote the collection of sets not in FR but uncovered in s\u2032 . Then from (2), (6) and Fmax = O(1),\nwe have\nE[cost(s\u2032 )] \u2264 cost(sad ) + E[c(Ron )] + Fmax * E[w(Fbad )]\n= cost(sad ) + O (E[|Ron |]) + O(E[w(Fbad )]),\nwhere we note that\ncost(sad ) \u2265 c(L) + w(FR ) = \u03a9(|L|) + \u03a9(|FR |).\nTherefore, the following two lemmas bounding w(Fbad ) and |Ron | leads to the desired bound on cost(s\u2032 ),\nwhich completes the proof of Theorem 2 from cost(s\u2032\u2032 ) = O(cost(s\u2032 )).\nLemma 6. w(Fbad ) \u2264 c(L).\nProof. Each set in Fbad should contain an off element in Loff that is best responding in s\u2032 . Hence,\n\u0011\n\u0010 [\nX\nX\nw(Fbad ) = w\nw(Flu ) \u2264\nFlu \u2264\ncl \u2264 c(L),\nl\u2208Loff\n\nl\u2208Loff\n\nl\u2208Loff\n\nwhere the second inequality is from the fact that l is best responding (i.e. its cost exceeds the total weight of\nuncovered sets including it since it chooses to be off ). This completes the proof of Lemma 6.\n\n8\n\n\f(\n|FR | + \u22062 * |L|2 + O(\u22062 ) * |L| if Fmax = O(1)\n.\nLemma 7. E[|Ron |] \u2264\n|FR | + O(|L|)\nif Fmax = 2\nProof. Since each element r in Ron plays best response in s\u2032 , r should be contained in a set \u03c3r as the unique\n(1)\n(2)\non element. We define disjoint sets Ron and Ron such that\n(1)\n(2)\nRon = Ron\n\u222a Ron\n(1)\n\n(1)\n\nand r \u2208 Ron if \u03c3r \u2208 FR . By definition of Ron , it easily follows that\n(1)\n| \u2264 |FR |.\n|Ron\n\n(8)\n\n(2)\n\nNow consider Ron . Let Foff be the collection of 'left' uncovered sets, i.e. \u03c3 \u2208 Foff if \u03c3\u222aL is a non-empty\n(2)\n(2)\nsubset of Loff . Hence, by definition of Ron , \u03c3r is in Foff for each r \u2208 Ron . This implies that\n(2)\n|Ron\n| \u2264 |Foff |.\n\n(9)\n\n\u2217 \u2282 F be the collection of sets containing a unique element in L . Then, we have\nWe let Foff\noff\noff\n\n(\n\u22062 * |L|2\n\u2217\n| \u2264\n|Foff \\ Foff\n0\n\nif Fmax = O(1)\n.\nif Fmax = 2\n\n(10)\n\nThis is because the number of sets with more than one element in Loff is bounded by \u22062 * |L|2 (remember\nthat each pair of agents is contained in at most \u22062 common sets). Clearly, there are no such sets when\nFmax = 2.\n\u2217 . It follows that\nWe now bound the expected size of Foff\n\u2217\nE[|Foff\n|] =\n\nX\n\n|Fl\u2217 | * Pr[l is off ],\n\n(11)\n\nl\u2208L\n\nwhere we let Fl\u2217 be the collection of sets including l as the unique element in L. Further, we observe that\nPr[l is off ] \u2264 Pr[|{\u03c1 \u2208 Fl\u2217 : all \u03c1 \u2229 R are off }| \u2264 cmax /wmin ]\n\u2264 Pr[|{\u03c1 \u2208 Fl\u2217 : all \u03c1 \u2229 R are receptive}| \u2264 cmax /wmin ]\n\u2264 Pr[|{\u03c1 \u2208 Fbl\u2217 : all \u03c1 \u2229 R are receptive}| \u2264 cmax /wmin ],\n\nwhere we define Fbl\u2217 \u2286 Fl\u2217 such that no pair of sets in Fbl\u2217 have common elements in R and the size of\nFbl\u2217 is not too small i.e. |Fl\u2217 | \u2264 (Fmax \u2212 1)\u22062 * |Fbl\u2217 |. From definitions of Fmax and \u22062 , the existence of\nsuch set Fbl\u2217 follows. Since no pair of sets in Fbl\u2217 have common elements in R, the events that all \u03c1 \u2229 R are\nreceptive for \u03c1 \u2208 Fbl\u2217 become independent with each other and each happens with probability at least \u03b1Fmax .\nTherefore,\nPr[l is off ] \u2264 Pr[|{\u03c1 \u2208 Fbl\u2217 : all \u03c1 \u2229 R are receptive}| \u2264 cmax /wmin ]\n\u230acmax /wmin \u230b \u0012 \u2217 \u0013\nX\n\u0001|Fb\u2217 |\u2212i Fmax \u0001i\n|Fbl |\n\u2264\n.\n\u03b1\n1 \u2212 \u03b1Fmax l\ni\ni=0\n\n9\n\n(12)\n\n\fCombining (11) and (12) implies that\n\u2217\nE[|Foff\n|]\n\n\u2264\n\nX\n\n|Fl\u2217 | *\n\nl\u2208L\n\n\u230acmax /wmin \u230b \u0012\n\nX\ni=0\n\n\u2264 (Fmax \u2212 1)\u22062\n\n/wmin \u230b\nX \u230acmaxX\nl\u2208L\n\n= O(\u22062 ) * |L|,\n\n\u0013\n\u0001|Fb\u2217 |\u2212i Fmax \u0001i\n|Fbl\u2217 |\n\u03b1\n1 \u2212 \u03b1Fmax l\ni\n\ni=0\n\n\u0012 b\u2217 \u0013\n\u0001|Fb\u2217 |\u2212i Fmax \u0001i\n|Fl |\n\u03b1\n1 \u2212 \u03b1Fmax l\ni\n\n|Fbl\u2217 |\n\n(13)\n\nwhere the last equality is from the following proposition of which proof is presented in Appendix A.\nProposition 8.

As we explain in the proof of\nTheorem 2, it suffices to prove that the social cost at the end of Phase 1 is O(cost(sad )) with probability\n1 \u2212 1/n.\nTo this end, the following lemma establishes the condition (\u22c6) ensures that all agents in L turn on with\nprobability 1 \u2212 1/n at the end of Phase 1. Under the event, only sets in FR are uncovered and the additional\nsocial cost incurred by agents in Ron . The lemma shows that such additional cost is at most cost(sad ).\nHence, this completes the proof of Theorem 4.\nLemma 9. If the advertising strategy sad satisfies the condition (\u22c6), then\nFbad = \u2205 and\n\nc(Ron ) \u2264 w(FR )\n\nwith probability 1 \u2212\n\n1\n.\nn\n\nProof. We will use the same notation in the proof Lemma 7. As in the proof Lemma 7, for any l \u2208 L\nthere is some subset Fbl\u2217 \u2286 Fl\u2217 such that no pair of sets in Fbl\u2217 have common elements in R and |Fbl\u2217 | \u2265\n|Fl\u2217 |\n(Fmax \u22121)\u22062\n\n\u2265\n\n\u2206\u22171\n(Fmax \u22121)\u22062 .Then\n\nPr[l is off ] \u2264\n\nas we derived in in the proof Lemma 7,\n\u230acmax /wmin \u230b \u0012\n\nX\ni=0\n\n\u0013\n\u0001|Fb\u2217 |\u2212i Fmax \u0001i\n|Fbl\u2217 |\n1\n\u2264 2,\n\u03b1\n1 \u2212 \u03b1Fmax l\nn\ni\n\nwhere the last inequality is from the condition (\u22c6). From the union bound, Pr[Loff = \u2205] \u2265 1 \u2212 1/n and\nhence Fbad = \u2205.\nNow assume the event that all nodes in L are on. Observe that for each best responding r \u2208 Ron , cr is\nno greater than the total weight of all sets containing r as the unique on agent. Since we assume all nodes\nin L are on these sets are a subset of FR . Further, since there is no overlap in these sets between different\nagents in Ron , we can sum over all r \u2208 Ron to derive c(Ron ) \u2264 w(FR ). This completes the proof of Lemma\n9.\n\n10\n\n\f3.2 Extension to Unbounded Costs and Weights\nAll the results and proof techniques in this paper naturally extend to general weights and costs. In particular,\none can obtain the following theorem (analogous to Theorem 2) in the PSA model without the assumption\n(6) via calculating explicit quantities in each step in the proof of Theorem 2.\nTheorem 10. For any advertised strategy sad in the PSA model,\n(\nO(\u22062 * \u2308cmax /wmin \u2309 * cmax /c3min ) * cost(sad )2\n\u2032\u2032\nE[cost(s )] \u2264\nO(\u2308cmax /wmin \u2309 * cmax /cmin ) * cost(sad )\n\nif Fmax = O(1)\n.\nif Fmax = 2\n\n(14)\n\n4 Learn-then-decide\nWe now study the set cover game in the learn-then-decide (LTD) model of [2]. In contrast to PSA, agents\nin LTD are neither strictly receptive nor strictly best responders in the initial exploration phase, but they\nchoose one of these options for the final exploitation phase:\n1: Play begins in an arbitrary state, and a central authority advertises joint action sad \u2208 S. Player i is\nassociated with fixed probability pi \u2265 \u03b2 \u2208 (0, 1). Agents are chosen to update uniformly at random\nfor each of T \u2217 time steps. When i updates, he plays sad\ni with probability pi or best response with\nprobability 1 \u2212 pi . The state at time T \u2217 is denoted s\u2032 .\n2: At time T \u2217 , all agents in random order individually commit arbitrarily to sad\ni or best response. Then\nagents take turns in random order playing their chosen strategy until they reach a Nash equilibrium s\u2032\u2032\ngiven the fixed behavior of sad followers.\n\nEffect of Advertising in LTD\nFor the convenience, in this section we again assume costs and weights are bounded above and below, i.e.\nthe assumption (6). The following result in the LTD model is analogous to Theorem 2 in the PSA model.\nTheorem 11. There exists a T \u2217 \u2208 poly(n) such that for any advertising strategy sad in the LTD model,\n(\nO(\u220622 ) * cost(sad )2 if Fmax = O(1)\n.\n(15)\nE[cost(s\u2032\u2032 )] \u2264\nO(1) * cost(sad )\nif Fmax = 2\nTheorem 11 implies that if sad is obtained from the O(Fmax )-approximation poly-time algorithm described in Section 2.2, the following corollary holds.\nCorollary 12. There exists a poly-time algorithm to find an advertising strategy sad for the LTD model such\nthat\n(\nO(\u220622 ) * OP T 2 if Fmax = O(1)\n\u2032\u2032\n.\nE[cost(s )] \u2264\nO(1) * OP T\nif Fmax = 2\n\nProof of Theorem 11\nTo begin with, we note that while LTD differs from PSA in both phases, the proof that cost is low in Phase\n1 of LTD is very similar to the proof of Theorem 2. However, showing that the cost stays low in Phase 2\nimposes new challenges.\n\n11\n\n\fWe will use the same notation as in the proof of Theorem 2. We first define E = E(T \u2032 , T \u2217 ) for 1 < T \u2032 <\nT \u2217 as the event that every element in L updates at least once before time T \u2032 after every element in R has\nupdated at least once, and then every element in R again updates at least once at some time t \u2208 [T \u2032 , T \u2217 ].\nClearly there exist some T \u2032 , T \u2217 \u2208 poly(n) such that E = E(T \u2032 , T \u2217 ) happens with the following high\nprobability, i.e.\n1\nPr[E] \u2265 1 \u2212 Fmax .\nn\nThen, we have\nE[cost(s\u2032\u2032 )] = Pr[E] * E[cost(s\u2032\u2032 ) | E] + Pr[E c ] * E[cost(s\u2032\u2032 ) | E c ]\n\u0001\n1\n\u2264 E[cost(s\u2032\u2032 ) | E] + Fmax * O nFmax\nn\n= E[cost(s\u2032\u2032 ) | E] + O(1),\n\n(16)\n\nwhere for \u0001the inequality we use the fact that the social cost is always bounded above by cmax *n+Fmax *|F| =\nO nFmax from (2) and (6).\nTherefore, it suffice to bound E[cost(s\u2032\u2032 ) | E], where our choice of T \u2217 is primarily for guaranteeing\nthat E happens with such a high probability. We first bound the expected social cost at the end of Phase 1\nunder the event E as below. And later, we will bound the increase in the social cost in Phase 2.\nLemma 13.\n\n(\nO(1) * cost(sad )\nE[cost(s\u2032 ) | E] \u2264\nO(\u22062 ) * cost(sad )2\n\nif Fmax = 2\n.\nif Fmax = O(1)\n\nProof. Similarly as in the proof of Theorem 2, we again note that\ncost(s\u2032 ) = cost(sad ) + O(|Ron |) + O(w(Fbad ))\nad\n\ncost(s ) = \u03a9(|L|) + \u03a9(|FR |).\n\n(17)\n(18)\n\nWe again remind that we will use the same notation as in the proof of Theorem 2.\nHence, it suffices to bound w(Fbad ) and |Ron | in terms of |L| and |FR |. First consider w(Fbad ). We\nseparately analyze the weights of two types of Fbad . First consider a set in Fbad \u2229 2L , i.e. a set consisting\nonly of elements in Loff . Suppose we attribute the weight of such a set to its element l that updated most\nrecently before the end of Phase 1. Because l \u2208 Loff played best response most recently, the weight of all\nsets in Fbad \u2229 2L attributed to l is at most cl . Summing over all l \u2208 Loff \u2286 L gives\nw(Fbad \u2229 2L ) \u2264 c(L) = O(|L|).\n\n(19)\n\nNow consider a set in Fbad \\2L , i.e. a set which has elements in both Loff and R and all of them are off at\nthe end of Phase 1. By definition of Foff , Fbad \\2L \u2282 Foff . Under assuming the event E, the proof arguments\nto bound |Foff | in the proof of Lemma 7 identically work in the LTD model (using \u03b2 instead of \u03b1), i.e. we\nhave\n(\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u22062 * |L|2 + O(\u22062 ) * |L| if Fmax = O(1)\nL\n.\n(20)\nE Fbad \\2 | E \u2264 E |Foff | | E =\nO(|L|)\nif Fmax = 2\n\nFrom (19) and (20), it follows that\n\n(\nO(\u22062 * |L|2 ) + O(\u22062 ) * |L| if Fmax = O(1)\n.\nE [w(Fbad ) | E] =\nO(|L|)\nif Fmax = 2\n\n12\n\n(21)\n\n\fNow under assuming event E, one can observe that the conclusion and proof strategy of Lemma 7 also\nworks for |Ron | in the LTD model, i.e.\n(\n|FR | + O(\u22062 * |L|2 ) + O(\u22062 ) * |L| if Fmax = O(1)\n.\n(22)\nE [|Ron | | E] =\n|FR | + O(|L|)\nif Fmax = 2\nTherefore, combining these bounds (17), (18), (21) and (22) leads to the desired bound of Lemma\n13.\nWe now bound the cost increase in Phase 2 assuming E. From (4) and Fmax = O(1) it suffices to\nprovide a bound on the expected increase in the potential function throughout Phase 2, i.e.\ncost(s\u2032\u2032 ) \u2264 Fmax * \u03a6(s\u2032\u2032 ) + Fmax * (\u2212\u03a6(s\u2032 ) + cost(s\u2032 ))\n= O(\u03a6(s\u2032\u2032 ) \u2212 \u03a6(s\u2032 )) + O(cost(s\u2032 )).\n\n(23)\n\nThe following lemma bounds the expected potential increase \u03a6(s\u2032\u2032 )\u2212\u03a6(s\u2032 ) under assuming event E. Finally,\ncombining (16), (23), Lemma 13 and Lemma 14 lead to the desired conclusion of Theorem 11.\nLemma 14.\nE[\u03a6(s\u2032\u2032 ) \u2212 \u03a6(s\u2032 ) | E] \u2264\n\n(\n\nO(\u220622 ) * cost(sad )2\nO(1) * cost(sad )\n\nif Fmax = O(1)\n.\nif Fmax = 2\n\nProof. Since best response moves do not increase the potential function \u03a6, we only consider updates of\nagents following the advertising strategy sad in Phase 2. Since each 'sad follower' changes strategies at\nmost once in Phase 2, it suffices to consider a single off -on move (following sad ) for each agent in L and a\nsingle on-off move (following sad ) for each agent in Ron . For each l \u2208 L, an off -on movie (i.e. l changes\nhis decision from off to on) increases potential by at most cl . Hence,\nthe total potential increase by on-off moves is at most c(L) = O(|L|).\n\n(24)\n\nNow consider another type of moves, i.e. a single on-off move for each agent in Ron . For each r \u2208 Ron\nthat first turns off at time t \u2265 T \u2217 , let Fr be the collection of sets containing r such that all of their other\nelements are off at time t. Then the potential increases by at most w(Fr ) = O(|Fr |) at time t. Hence,\nP\nthe total potential increase by off -on moves is at most O( r\u2208Ron |Fr |) = O (|\u222ar\u2208Ron Fr |).\n(25)\n\nWe will bound the expectation of | \u222ar\u2208Ron Fr |. To this end, we consider two types of set \u03c3 including an\nelement in Ron : (a) \u03c3 has an element l\u03c3 \u2208 L that was on at the end of Phase 1, and (b) otherwise. Observe\nthat the expected number of sets of type (b) which does not in FR is already bounded in the proof of Lemma\n13 by |Foff | i.e.\n(\n\u22062 * |L|2 + O(\u22062 ) * |L| if Fmax = O(1)\n.\nE[ the number of sets in \u222ar\u2208Ron Fr \\ FR of type (b) | E] =\nO(|L|)\nif Fmax = 2\nTherefore, we have\n(\n|FR | + \u22062 * |L|2 + O(\u22062 ) * |L| if Fmax = O(1)\n.\nE[ the number of sets in \u222ar\u2208Ron Fr of type (b) | E] =\n|FR | + O(|L|)\nif Fmax = 2\n(26)\n13\n\n\fThus, we only focus on set \u03c3 of type (a). Let Fl\u03c3 ,Roff be the sets containing l\u03c3 and all of their elements\nin R being off at the end of Phase 1. Our key observation here is that set \u03c3 of type (a) will only possibly\nbecome uncovered when an r \u2208 \u03c3 \u2229 Ron turns off if all but at most \u2308cmax /wmin \u2309 sets in Fl\u03c3 ,Roff have an\nelement in R that updates before r updates. Otherwise, l\u03c3 have too many uncovered sets to turn off before\nr turns off (hence, it remains on). For an arbitrary updating ordering of agents in R \\ {r}, there are at\nleast |Fl\u03c3 ,Roff |/\u22062 elements that are the first updating agent in some set \u03c1 \u2208 Fl\u03c3 ,Roff . Therefore, for each\nr \u2208 \u03c3 \u2229 Ron ,\n\u2308cmax /wmin \u2309 + 1\n.\nPr[\u03c3 \u2208 Fr | E] \u2264\n|Fl\u03c3 ,Roff |/\u22062 + 1\nUsing the union bound,\nPr[\u03c3 \u2208 \u222ar\u2208Ron Fr | E] \u2264 Fmax *\n\n\u2308cmax /wmin \u2309 + 1\n.\n|Fl\u03c3 ,Roff |/\u22062 + 1\n\nNow let Fl,R \u2286 F be the sets containing l \u2208 L and at least one element of R. Note also that given\nE, random variable Dl := |Fl,Roff | has (first-order) dominance over the binomial random variable X \u223c\n\u0011\n\u0010\n|F |\nFmax .

Since we are simply relabeling actions, all the results from the previous\nsections apply. The packing interpretation of this problem is easiest seen with the simple example where\nsets are of size 2, ci = c < 1 for all i, and w\u03c3 = 1 for all \u03c3. In the original formulation of the problem, the\nsets of on agents in Nash equilibria are minimal vertex covers. In the new formulation, the sets of on agents\nin Nash equilibria are maximal independent sets.\n\n6 Conclusions\nIn recent years, game theoretic frameworks have provided informative models for analyzing the outcomes\nof games among autonomous agents or components programmed as autonomous agents. However, many\n14\n\n\fgames, including those studied in this paper, often suffer from high Price of Anarchy, meaning that without\na central authority it is hard to induce a state with low social cost. In this paper we study how weak\nbroadcasting signals from a central authority are enough to induce states with low social cost in a general\nclass of covering and packing problems. In particular, we show that for any advertising strategy sad , games\nwith constantly bounded costs and weights converge either in the public service advertising model of [1]\nor in the learn-then-decide model of [2] to a state with cost O(cost(sad )2 ). Moreover, in both models\nwe show convergence to a state of cost O(cost(sad )) if all sets are of size 2. Furthermore, for particular\nand poly-time computable sad in the PSA model, we guarantee convergence to a state within a O(log n)\nfactor of optimum for any game with sets of constant size. We believe that the techniques introduced in this\npaper to analyze covering and packing games could be of broader interest for analyzing classic optimization\nproblems in a distributed fashion.\n\nAcknowledgements\nThis work was supported in part by ONR grant N00014-09-1-0751, by AFOSR grant FA9550-09-1-0538,\nby NSF Career grant CCF-0953192.\n\nReferences\n[1] M.-F.
