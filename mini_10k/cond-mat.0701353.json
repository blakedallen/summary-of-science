INTRODUCTION\nThe piezoelectric performance of relaxor single crystals provides excellent opportunities\nfor improvements in medical ultrasonic imaging, sonar applications, active damping and high\nstrain actuation, if the costs can be reduced. PMN(PZN)-PT single crystals exhibit unique\nelectromechanical properties when poled along the non-polar <100> direction. This is related to\nthe fact that single crystal domains easily oriente during poling so that the maximum response is\nobtained. A longitudinal coupling coefficient k33 of 90% and an exceptional piezoelectric\ncoefficient d33 > 2000 pC/N can be obtained (1-2).. While expensive crystal growth techniques\nare advancing, it is of great practical importance to develop an alternative low-cost production\nmethod based on strongly oriented or textured ceramics.\nPb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3-PbTiO3 (PMN(1-x)-PTx) solid solution offers a large set of\nferroelectric/piezoelectric properties. Ceramics elaborated by solid-state sintering (x = 0.35)\nexhibit an electro-mechanical coupling efficiency of k33 = 70%, \u03b5 ~ 4000 and a longitudinal d33\npiezoelectric coefficient of 500 pC/N (3). Due to the random crystallographic orientation of the\nbulk ceramic, engineering of ferroelectric domains cannot be achieved and one gets an average\nof the directionally dependent physical properties.\nCeramic texturing via Templated Grain Growth (TGG) consists in orientating a\ndispersion of large anisotropic template particles in a green state fine particle matrix. During\nsintering, seed growth consumes the surrounding matrix grains and creates a crystallographically\noriented ceramic. TGG process efficiency has been demonstrated in a wide variety of systems,\nincluding A12O3, mullite, Bi4Ti3O12 and Sr2Nb2O7 (4,5). To date, textured Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3PbTiO3 ceramics have been obtained by Reactive Templated Grain Growth (RTGG) using\nBa/SrTiO3 seeds (6). The problem with heterogeneous seeding is the residual presence of\ntemplates (6,7). The strain-electric field hysteresis is then larger than in random ceramics while\nthe electro-mechanical properties measured by low-field resonance are still much smaller than\nobserved in single crystals (8). Un-reacted BaTiO3 templates exhibiting low piezoelectric\nproperties reduce the effective properties of textured samples.\nWe demonstrated recently that textured PMN-PT ceramics could be prepared by homoepitaxy template grain growth using PMN-PT templates (HTGG) (9-10). Alternative method\nusing an initially cracked single crystal seed plate was reported (11,12). Any matrix composition\n\n\f3\ncan be achieved but crystal seed composition must match with the phase diagram and therefore\nare limited in number. In this work we first analysed single crystal seeds and pure ceramics of\ndifferent compositions (0<x<1) by Raman spectroscopy, in order to establish a relationship\nbetween Raman parameters and composition distribution. Our goal is to check the validity of\nSmart Raman Imaging as a control method for textured ceramics. We then studied the grain\ngrowth process and the composition homogenisation for two different seed/matrix couples,\nrepresentative of the first and final growing process. Topological, chemical and crystallographic\ntransformations are discussed in the light of x-ray diffraction, TGA, DTA and Raman imaging\nresults.\n\n2. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE\nSamples\nMatrix Powder\nPMN-PT nanoparticles were synthesized using the columbite method (11) and milled by\ncontinuous attrition milling with micro-beads.\nSeeds\nPMN-PT cubic shaped (x~ 0.25) single crystals were prepared using the flux method (10).\nCrystals with size close to 20-50 \u03bcm were selected by sieving.\nCeramics\nPMN-PT nano-powders and a few weight percent of PMN-PT single crystal templates were\nmixed with an organic binder to obtain a homogenous slurry. Two weight percent of PbO was\nadded. The mixture was tape-cast using a doctor blade. Green tapes of 100-150 \u03bcm thick were\ndried, laminated and cut into disk (diameter = 16 mm, 0.5 to 3 mm thick). Ceramic sintering was\nmade under O2 flow between 1150 and 1200\u00b0C for different durations in a PbO-rich atmosphere\ncontrolled using crucibles packed in a PbO-rich powder mixture..\n\nTechniques\nOptical microscopy\nMicrostructures were observed on as-sintered and polished surfaces using an Olympus\noptical microscope (up to x1000 magnification).\nTGA and DTA\n\n\f4\nMeasurements were recorded on a TA instrument apparatus. All experiments were performed\nby heating/cooling cycles at a rate of 20\u00b0C/mn in a Pt open-crucible under O2 flow. The rather\nhigh heating/cooling rate prevents excessive volatilisation of the PbO.\nDensity was measured using the Archimedes method.\nRaman microspectrometry\nAn \"XY\" spectrograph (Dilor, France) equipped with a double monochromator filter and a\nback-illuminated, liquid nitrogen-cooled, 2000 x 256 pixels CCD detector (Spex, Jobin-Yvon\u2013\nHoriba Company) was used for recording down to ca. 10 cm-1 with a 647.1 nm excitation line\n(slit = 80 \u03bcm). A514.53 nm excitation was also used to obtain a large, one shot, spectral\nwindow. Various objectives from MSPlan, Japan (numerical aperture = 0.50-0.80; magnification\n= 10, 50 and 100) were used; the total magnifications are 100, 500 and 1000 and the confocal\nhole aperture was ~ 100 \u03bcm. Rare spikes (cosmic ray) and some plasma lines were removed\nfrom the spectra. The laser spot waist was 1 \u03bcm with the x100 objective.\nRaman imaging: In order to map the growth seed distribution, 2000 Raman spectra were\nrecorded over a large area (typically: 200x700 \u03bcm2) using a computer-controlled XY table (12).\nDuring the measurement all moving parts are fixed and a mercury lamp emission is used to\ncontrol the grating position. This procedure guaranties a reproducibility of +- one pixel, i.e.\nbetter than +- 1cm-1 for the used excitation wavelengths.\nX-ray diffraction\nPatterns were obtained using a Philips Instrument. The degree of <001> orientation was\nestimated from the XRD patterns using the Lotgering method (13). The Lotgering factor (f) is\ndefined as the fraction of area textured with the crystallographic plane of interest. The degree of\n<001>-texturing for the PMN-PT ceramics was calculated with the Lotgering formula:\n\nf (00\u03bb ) = P(00\u03bb ) P0 / (1 - P0)\nP(00\u03bb ) = \u03a3 I(00\u03bb) / \u03a3(hkl) ; P0 = \u03a3I0(00\u03bb) / \u03a3I0(hkl)\n\n(1)\n(2)\n\n\u03a3I(00\u03bb) is the sum for the textured sampl of all {00l} XRD peaks intensities; \u03a3I(hkl) is calculated\nthe same way with all {hkl} peaks. \u03a3I0(00\u03bb) and \u03a3I0(hkl) are the XRD peak intensities for the\nrandomly oriented sample.\nPeak fitting and data processing\nIn undertaking a curve fit of a single Raman spectrum, the linear baseline was first\nsubtracted using LabSpec\u00ae software (Dilor, France). An Origin peak-fitting module (Microcal\u00ae\nSoftware, Inc., USA) was used to calculate the integral area, the bandwidth and the centre of\n\n\f5\ngravity for each component. The same spectral window was always used. A Gaussian shape was\nassumed for all Raman lines because of the amorphous state of examined materials (a Lorentzian\nshape is used for crystalline phase components).\nThe analysis of multi-spectra sets (images) was performed using in house-produced\n\u00ab PARADIS \u00bb software based on the Levenberg-Marquardt method (12,14). The spectra did not\nreceive any 'manual' treatment since the software automatically sets the baseline (for complex\nbackgrounds we introduced Gaussians). A reference spectrum is decomposed first (shape and\nintensity modelling) and the result is compared with that obtained with Origin\u00ae Software. Very\nsimilar data are obtained. The result serves as a starting point for one of the neighbouring\nspectra. Each spectrum is fitted using the data coming from its neighbour, which minimises the\nstandard deviation when decomposition starts. When the model contains only Gaussians and/or\nLorentzians, the calculation time is short (a few seconds per spectrum for a ~1 MHz clock PC).\nThe images of any pertinent parameters, such as the wavenumber or the peak intensity, are\nfinally treated using Origin\u00ae 5.0 software.\n\n3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\n3.1. Microstructure\nSingle crystal seeds\nOptical (Fig.1a) and SEM (Fig. 1b) photographs show the PMN-PT cubic crystals of\n~50x50x50 \u03bcm3 that were prepared and selected as templates. Typical green (Fig. 1c) and fired\nceramic microstructures (Fig. 2) are shown.\nOriented green tape\nHTGG process requires an ultrafine matrix, large templates and an appropriate liquid\nphase for the development of the microstructure. The higher the surface area of the powder, the\nhigher the driving force for the densification. The PMN-PT perovskite powder used exhibits a\nspecific surface area of ~12-15 m2/g and TEM photograph shows aggregates of about 1 \u03bcm\nconstituted by nano-particles of 10 to 100 nm. Green tapes of 100-150 \u03bcm thickness obtained by\ntape casting exhibit cubic templates oriented with the <001> plane perpendicular to the tape\nsurface (Fig. 1c).\nWe will consider two types of samples, representative of the most different cases\nencountered in the synthesis campaigns:\n\n\f6\n- i)\n\na sample sintered at 1150\u00b0C (here after called #1-sample), with large crystals\n\ndispersed in the ceramic matrix. Apart from large cubic-shaped crystals, many small crystals (in\nwhite on optical micrographs) < 10 \u03bcm in size are observed (Fig. 2a). The matrix grain size is ~2\n\u03bcm (Fig. 2e), much smaller than the size of the pristine crystal seeds. The density is 7.66 (i.e.\n95% of the theoretical density).\n- ii) a sample sintered at 1200\u00b0C (#2-sample), exhibiting a nearly complete pavement of\nlarge sized crystals. The residual matrix is only present along part of the grain boundary\nnetwork.\nThese two samples have been prepared using the same seed and nano-powder batches and\nthey are representative of the microstructures obtained in our numerous syntheses. A comparison\nof corresponding X-ray powder patterns is given in Fig. 3. The density is 7.05 (i.e. 88% of the\ntheoretical density).\nIn both as-sintered samples the growth area around the pristine crystal seed is obvious:\nthe crystal core appears in black and the periphery in white (Fig.2a,b). Laping and polishing #2samples made it possible to analyse their evolution with thermal treatment: at the beginning of\nthe thermal treatment well-faceted crystal are observed. Residual smooth pores then appear\nbetween adjacent crystals (Fig. 2f).\nX-Ray Diffraction spectra of Tape Cast Textured Ceramics (TCTC)\nXRD spectra recorded on as-sintered surfaces (Fig. 3) show the ceramic sintered at\n1100\u00b0C presents a random orientation (highest intensity observed for the (100) peak) as for a\ngreen tape. A strong increase of the (00\u03bb) diffraction peak intensities was observed for samples\nsintered at 1150\u00b0C, indicating an increase in the crystallographic (001) orientation of the TCTC\nsamples. For ceramics sintered at 1200\u00b0C during 10h, the XRD spectrum presents only the\npeaks due to the (00\u03bb) orientation (Fig 2c). TCTC disks (\u03a6~14 mm) exhibiting a texture of 0.7\nand 0.9 (Lotgering factor) were obtained for ceramics sintered for 10h at 1150 and 1200\u00b0C\nrespectively. Examination of the #1-sample microstructure shows crystals with sharp corners and\nstraight edges, regardless of the size, indicating that an equilibrium state similar to the one\nobserved in ref 8 has been reached. On the other hand, #2-samples show smoothed edges and\nspherical pores (Fig. 2d) which are typical features of ceramics densified by liquid phase\nsintering with the high vapour pressure of PbO, as could be expected for the higher sintering\ntemperature. No traces of pyrochlore phases were observed.\nThese results seem to indicate that the texture starts to develop at 1150\u00b0C and grows at\nhigher temperature and/or for long sintering. At room temperature, the doublet observed for the\n\n\f7\n(002) reflection peak reveals the mixture of rhombohedral and tetragonal phases. Above the\nCurie temperature (200\u00b0C), only one peak is observed on the type #2-sample spectra while the\ndoublet remains for the type #1-sample (13). This doublet was thus assigned to two different\ncompositions for the #1 sample in the cubic phase. The most important peak observed at the\nsame position as for the #2-sample (unit-cell parameter a = 4.026 \u00c5) obviously corresponds to\nthe PMN-PT x = 0.35 matrix composition while the second one (4.0185 \u00c5) is related to the x=\n0.25 seed composition.\nPhase diagram and growth mechanisms: Typical DTA/TG results are compared in Fig. 4. The\nDTA diagram of PbTiO3 single crystals shows a strong endothermic peak at 1295\u00b0C, which\ncorresponds to the melting temperature; large hysteresis is observed on cooling with an\nexothermic crystallisation peak at 1225\u00b0C. Note also the pre-transitional asymmetry of the\nmelting endothermic peak. Very similar features are observed for the PMN0.65PT0.35 single\ncrystals and a random ceramic (sintered from already formed PMN-PT perovskite powders).\nHowever, an endothermic jump is observed on heating at ~1180\u00b0C in DTA for the ceramic\nsample while only a smooth pre-transitional effect is observed for the reference single crystals.\nThe strong and narrow endothermic peak observed at 1140\u00b0C for PZN-PT single crystals was\nattributed by Doug and Ye (16) to the partial decomposition of the perovskite phase, leading to\nthe formation of the pyrochlore phase and the segregation of PbO. Non eutectic solidification of\nPMN-PT with no segregated PbO was observed near 830\u00b0C. Very small endothermic events (at\nca. 850\u00b0C) can be observed for #2 samples by zooming in the DTA traces (Fig. 4). We observe\nthe superimposition of a 1225\u00b0C narrow peak on cooling, as for the PT composition. The\nfollowing equation can be proposed:\nPMN1-x-PTx => PMN1-x-PTx-y + y PT\n\n(3)\n\nThe accident near 1180\u00b0C could be due to either i) a strong sintering having the effect of\ndecreasing the contact area between the sample and the crucible or ii) a second order (crystalline\nphase) or Tg (glassy phase) transition or iii) a very broad \"incongruent\" melting endothermic\neffect. Because the phenomenon is reversible, a second order phase transition appears to be a\nreasonable explanation. However, we see a broad exothermic peak on cooling from ~1300 to\n1180\u00b0C, which could correspond to the solidification of a \"glassy\" phase mixing nonstoichiometric B/B' domains. Note the kink observed at ~1000\u00b0C simultaneously with the onset\nof weight loss is certainly due to the sample sintering and subsequent decrease of the samplecrucible contact. The second kink observed on the TG plot corresponds to the melting point and\nthe increase of the PbO evaporation rate. Details of the DTA runs performed successively on the\ntwo types of textured ceramics show marked differences: for the #1-sample first heating cycle, a\n\n\f8\nrather large endothermic anomaly is observed between 1000 and 1100\u00b0C as already observed on\na random ceramic. A plateau is then observed up to ~1240\u00b0C, i.e. up to the onset of melting. On\nthe contrary the #2-textured ceramic shows a small exothermic bump. These different behaviours\nconfirm that growth conditions are different for the two types of samples. It is worth noting that\nno pyrochlore phase was observed in the two textured ceramics either on XRD spectra or on\nRaman spectra. The schematic phase diagram proposed in Fig 5 is different to that proposed for\nthe homologous Zn-solid solution (16). We postulate the existence of two liquid phase regions to\nexplain the observed grain shape and DTA traces. By analogy with the PZNT system (16), a\neutectic composite is expected close to the 75 % PbO composition. #1-samples are prepared at\n1150\u00b0C, i.e. at the temperature of the endothermic anomaly (region I) whereas #2-samples are\nobtained in the region II plateau, just below the melting point. Growth conditions in this later\nregion are very sensitive to the PbO volatility and to any modification of the PMN-PT melting\ntemperature. Any local heterogeneity of the solid solution will modify the liquid (composition,\nviscosity, ...).\n\nThe existence of two different liquid phases appears the most reasonable\n\nexplanation for the observed microstructure: the first one would appear at ~1185\u00b0C, enabling for\nthe initial growth of well-faceted crystals on cubic seeds and the second one would appear above\n1250\u00b0C (see the shape of the strong endothermic events on Fig. 4) concomitant with a stronger\nPbO evaporation and thus a composition shift within the solid solution range.\nSpherical pores at the grain boundary relic appear characteristic of #2-samples (Fig. 2f).\nDifferent mechanisms could be at their origin: i) high PbO partial pressure or ii) the Kirkendal\neffect (17). This second mechanism would imply that vacancies and ions (Mg2+ or Pb2+ ions?)\ndiffuse simultaneously but at different rates. This would be consistent with the modification of\nthe short-range composition, as schematized by equation 3. More data are needed to further\nunderstand this last phenomenon and its relationship with B/B'ordered domains.\n\n3.2. Raman signature and composition dependence\nFig. 6 compares the Raman spectra of different matrices, from pure Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3 (x\n= 0) to pure PbTiO3 (x = 1). The matrix grain size and the grain size far from the seeded regions\nis ~ 0.5 \u03bcm, much smaller than the size of the crystal seeds. This very small grain size makes,\nthat even with high magnification objectives, the spectra recorded are \"powder\" Raman spectra\ntaking the different polarisations into account.\nAccording to the relaxor structure, Raman peaks are very broad. This has already been\nrelated to short-range intrinsic disorder (18-24), i.e. there are zones where the cations are\ndisplaced from their high-symmetry positions giving rise to a local electric dipole. Because\n\n\f9\nRaman spectroscopy is sensitive both to the atomic dynamics (through the wavenumber centre of\ngravity) and the local electric charge transfer (through the intensity), local electric defects disturb\nthe spectrum a lot (25).\nThe Raman spectrum can be separated into three regions, the low-wavenumber region\n(<150 cm-1), the mid-wavenumber region (150-380 cm-1) and the high-wavenumber region (>\n380 cm-1). According to previous literature reports, the low-wavenumber region is attributed to\nvibrations associated with motions of A cations (accordingly, corresponding peaks are very\nnarrow in peroskite-type structures free of any A cation disorder). We chose to compare our\nsamples spectra with the Ba6Nb2O11 compound (26) because it is an \"ordered\" Nb-based\nperovskite free of A cation disorder (very narrow low wavenumber components are observed).\nThe mid-wavenumber region involves bending motions of the BO6 octahedron and the highwavenumber region the stretching modes. These high-wavenumber modes are dominated by\nvibration of O2- anions involving the most rigid cation-oxygen bonds inside the BO6 octahedron\n(breathing modes). As expected, Ba/M substitution (giving fast oxygen/proton diffusion)\nbroadens this region drastically because different short-range order/domains (26). Comparison of\nthe different spectra shows that the 700-900 cm-1 peak is dominated by the Nb-O stretching\ncomponents (Fig. 6). On the other hand, the 500-700 cm-1 region mainly reflects the contribution\nof Ti-O modes, their lower intensity arising from the lower atomic number and, hence, a smaller\nnumber of electrons involved in the bond. The merging of the different well-defined peaks of a\nsingle B site occupied Ti-perovskite into a broad pattern for the mixed one is assigned to the\nspecial short-range disorder of the relaxor structure. Note that the centre of gravity of the band is\nvery similar to that of the Ba6Nb2O11 perovskite, in agreement with a dominant contribution of\nmodes involving Nb-containing vibrational entities. Thus, in a first approximation based on the\nquasi-molecular description, we can say that analysis of the 700-900 cm-1 region will give\ninformation on the local structure of the NbO6 octahedron. The centre of gravity and area in this\nband could be used as a probe to follow compositional changes, if it is assumed that the structure\nremains unchanged or that its changes are averaged by the band broadness. On the other hand,\nthe behaviour of the 200-400 cm-1 region will give information on the short-range arrangement\nof the A cation\u2013BO6 octahedron. Note the ca. 100 cm-1 narrow peak, characteristic of the long\nrange A order, drastically broadens with Nb/Mg substitution as previously observed for parent\nperovskites (26).\nComposition dependence\nAll spectra have been decomposed as shown in Figure 6. Because of the high short-range\ndisorder and non-resonant character of Raman scattering, each component was considered as a\n\n\f10\nGaussian (Table 1). An example of a component area plot as a function of x composition is given\nin Fig. 7. The plot of the centre of gravity of the main component (Fig. 8) shows a slow but\nregular shift with x composition for the 580, 750 and 800 cm-1 peaks.\nThe main changes associated with the PMN/PT solid solution consist in the increase of\nthe splitting of the BO6 stretching modes (750 and 805 cm-1 components, Table 1) and the downshift of the peak at ca. 600 cm-1 (involving Ti-O stretching modes, Fig. 8 and Table 2). Note also\nthat Mg/Nb substitution and PMN/PT phase mixing lead to an increase of the low-wavenumber\nband intensity, as observed on heating ion-conducting perovskites (26). Conversely, this effect is\nreduced under pressure (20,21). We can expect the unit-cell expansion observed on heating or by\ndecreasing pressure to promote stronger dipoles and the intensity of the low-wavenumber region\ncan probably be used as a parameter to measure the relaxor degree.\nSensitivity and experimental error\nSpectroscopic changes are rather small. In order to assess the sensitivity of the\nmeasurement, we performed different line scans across selected (large) single crystals, as shown\nin Fig. 1a. Wavenumber accuracy is determined by comparing the data of about 20 line scans\n(Table 1). The error (~1 cm-1) corresponds to the expected value for our experimental conditions\n(fixed position of the two-stage monochromator with ~1 pixel per cm-1). Reproducibility of the\nmonochromator position is controlled using an Hg lamp and CCl4 reference. The peak area\nappears to be very sensitive to the pristine seed growth process: an example is shown in Fig. 9\nfor the wavenumber of the ca. 750 cm-1 component. Spectra were recorded along a line from the\ncentre of the crystal seed to the periphery. The peak area \u2013 and wavenumber\u2013 is stable up to 20\n\u03bcm from the crystal centre and then drops from there to the periphery. This fact reveals growth\nirregularity assigned to a composition change at the end of the flux growth process.\nTable 2 summarizes the data obtained for the different matrix compositions. Taking Table\n1 data into account and assuming that the observed variation must be at least 3 times larger than\nthe mean dispersion to be considered significant, we can conclude that the components at ca.\n430, 750 and 800 cm-1 are sensitive probes.\nPhase characterisation: Raman spectroscopy has intrinsic selectivity due to that wavenumber\nposition arises mainly from the mechanics of atoms although the peak intensity arises from the\nlocal conductivity. The wavenumber set chiefly depends on the atoms structure (mass and bond\nlength). On the other hand, the local charge transfer and the bond polarisability determine the\nband intensity. Consequently the plot of the wavenumber as a function of x-composition (Fig. 8)\nobviously shows the homogeneous behaviour expected for a solid solution. On the contrary, peak\narea plot versus composition shows different regimes which can be related to the different unit-\n\n\f11\ncell distortions (with different ferroelectric properties) shown by X-ray diffraction (13,27): a\nsingle rhombohedral cell (R) for x<0.25, a mixture of two monoclinic cells (M1 + M2) between\n0.25 and 0.35 and a mixture of monoclinic and tetragonal cells (M2 + T) for x> 0.35. Note the\nlarge electric disorder at the very local scale breaks the periodicity and the Raman spectrum\nreflects the vibrational density-of-state of the entire Brillouin zone. Polarization effects are thus\nsmall and this makes our assumption to consider the crystal spectrum as a \"powder\" spectrum\nreasonable.\n\n3.3. Raman Imaging\nRaman spectra and their direct and \"smart\" images can be used to understand and even\npredict some properties (12). Figure 10 shows a direct Raman image recorded on an as-sintered\n#1-sample. The peak area measured in a given wavenumber window is plotted for each point of\nmeasure (3000 points). High values are observed at the periphery of some grown grains.\nCorresponding spectra show a very large scattering ascribed to fluorescence (Fig. 10). Two types\nof fluorescence can be observed in our ceramics. The first originates from 3d or 4f doping ions\nor impurities (this undesirable doping can be due to rare earth and transition element traces in the\nstarting powders (28,29). The second originates from organic bonds grafted at the pores' surface;\nthis type of fluorescence is encountered in ancient or excavated ceramics or on polished porous\nsamples (polishing agent residues). It is easily eliminated by thermal treatment or by using high\nlaser power illumination and/or blue/violet excitation and can consequently be ruled out for the\nsamples sintered at high temperature and not polished. The PMN-PT matrix powder was doped\nwith Mn, the fluorescence thus being assigned to the presence of specific 3d/4f elements (Mn\nelement and their impurities) concentrated at the periphery of larger crystals. This is consistent\nwith a concentration of doping impurities in the material obtained by final solidification from the\nmother interstitial liquid phase. Wallace et al. (30) claimed that cubic-shaped crystals formation\nis related to a large liquid phase volume fraction (>0.4). The lack or the very small occurrence of\nPbO/eutectic melting events shown byon DTA traces demonstrates that the liquid phase volume\nfraction is not the prominent parameter.\nIn order to distinguish the Raman spectrum from the fluorescence background, we\ndescribe the later phenomena with a broad Gaussian band centered in the analysed window.\nResults are shown in Fig. 11. This example shows a typical spectrum after the fluorescence\ncontribution has been removed, to be compared with the Fig. 12-spectrum whose the data are\nfree of fluorescence).\n#1-Sample:\n\n\f12\nThe images showing the calculated centre of gravity and peak area clearly show three\nregions (Fig. 11): the matrix, the grains' core (i.e. single crystal seeds) and their periphery.\nClear-cut images are obtained for the main (ca. 800 cm-1) component. The difference in the peak\narea of the main matrix and the grain core is straightforward: the highest values reveal the\npristine seed surface (ca. 50 x 50 \u03bcm2, as in Fig. 1). The growth mechanism seems to be limited\nto the interface between the seed and the matrix. The seed surface appears not to be modified.\nMean values calculated for each region are summarized in Table 3. Note the size of the core\nregion corresponds well to the surface of pristine seeds. The very high peak area measured on the\nseed surface indicates that the surface was preserved from any modification. This large contrast\nalso results from the difference in ferroelectric behaviour.\n#2-Sample\nThe images show very good homogeneity (Fig. 12): whereas the wavenumber and peak\narea shifts are ca. 30 cm-1 and 3800 counts-cm-1 in the type #1-sample (Table 4), these shifts are\nonly 6 cm-1 and 200 counts in the type #2-sample. Only very few locations show out-of-range\nvalues. They correspond to the centre of rare relics of pristine crystalline seeds. It is clear that the\nsurface of the pristine seeds has been modified. Typically, the observed crystal size is 150 x 150\n\u03bcm2. Very similar results are obtained for the different components (Table 3). The wavenumber\nand peak area of the contour are very similar to that of the matrix. This indicates that the\ncomposition of the material that grows at the seed-matrix interface is determined by the matrix\ncomposition and that it is therefore not necessary that the seed composition exactly correspond to\nthe desired final composition. Furthermore the low content of the initially dispersed seeds (a few\n% in weight) makes the contribution of the matrix dominant. These data are consistent with Xray diffraction patterns, representative of average structure (and long distance order). This\nreveals only one texture for the #2-sample, the composition of which is close to that of the\nceramic matrix, but two different composition textures for #1-samples.\nThe local composition has been calculated using the correlation established in the first\npart of the work. According to the low dispersion of the data in the type #2 sample, the\ncomposition is rather homogeneous: the grain core x composition lies between 0.25-0.4 as a\nfunction of the seed and the matrix composition is close to 0.3-0.35.\n\n4. CONCLUSION\nTextured ceramics corresponding to Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3-PbTiO3 (PMN(1-x)-PTx) solid\nsolutions have been prepared by homo-epitaxial templated grain growth (HTGG), using PMN-\n\n\f13\nPT cubic templates and nanoparticles and controlled atmosphere sintering. The wavenumber\ncentre of gravity versus x composition relationship enables the x composition to be extracted\nand, hence, for its distribution to be imaged in the pristine seed and between the seeds and the\npristine ceramic matrix. Ceramics displaying medium and high texturing were obtained by\ndifferent growth conditions: at low temperature, sharp cornered and straight edged single crystal\nseeds develop through the liquid phase at the crystal/matrix interface. It is clear that the\ncrystalline material growing from an interstitial liquid phase at the seed-matrix interface\nconcentrates the impurities soluble in the liquid phase and that the composition of the grown\nperovskite is determined by the matrix composition. It is thus not necessary that the composition\nof the pristine seed dispersed in the green matrix has the target composition. The different\ncompositions shown by Raman imaging are consistent with the two textures observed by X-ray\ndiffraction. Two different growth mechanisms have been identified and a schematic pseudobinary phase diagram is proposed. At high temperature, the matrix is consumed and crystals\ndevelop in all the ceramics, with the help of a liquid phase I (< 1185\u00b0C) or a liquid phase II (>\n1200\u00b0C). High temperature processed materials have a secondary closed porosity (bubbles)\nalong grain boundary phantoms. Smart Raman imaging shows that the final composition is very\nclose that of the matrix. The use of an appropriate procedure and software to model the Raman\nfingerprint and extract parameters is mandatory to clear the spectra from undesired contributions\n(for instance the fluorescence, observed in many cases). Useful information can be extracted in\nour case in spite of the broadness of Raman patterns after determination of the method accuracy.\nMain conclusions are summarized in Table 4. The bands' centre of gravity reflects the\nhomogeneous character of the PMN-PT solid solution, while their peak area shows the local\nB/B' heterogeneity and associated unit-cell distortions. This first use of Raman imaging of\ntextured ceramics deserves new analyses in combination with other techniques (EDAX, EPMA,\netc.). The main advantage of the non-destructive Raman technique is its potential to image\ncomposition shift and unit-cell distortion without a complex preparation of the samples.\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nThis work was supported in part by \"PYRAMID\" project under European Fifth\nFramework Programme.
