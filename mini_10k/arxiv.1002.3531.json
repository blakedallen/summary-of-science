We found for this BL Lac object a drastic change in the kinematics of the nuclear jet, i.e, transition from 'typical superluminal' to an unusual 'stationary' state.

Introduction\nThe strong radio source PKS 0735+178 is an optically bright\nclassical BL Lac object, highly variable at radio/optical wavelengths (e.g., Goyal et al. 2009 and references therein). Based\non an absorption feature in the optical spectrum, a lower redshift\nlimit of 0.424 was established (Abraham, et al. 1991; Stickel et\nal. 1993; Scarpa et al. 2000). This is consistent with the non detection of the optical host in the HST snapshot imaging survey\nby Sbarufatti et al. (2005). A companion (possible absorber) has\nbeen detected at a projected separation of 22 kpc (Pursimo et al.\n1999). Extensive monitoring of this blazar in the radio and optical bands revealed variability on different timescales. Periodic\nfeatures of 13.8-14.2 years were found by applying the Jurkevich\nmethod to about a century long optical monitoring data (Fan et\nal. 1997; Qian & Tao 2004). Ciprini et al. (2007) reported possible detection of several shorter time scales. In their search for\nintra-night optical variability on 17 nights between 1998 and\n2008, Goyal et al. (2009) did not detect on any occasion intranight variability with an amplitude \u22653%, though such ampli-\n\ntudes are typical for radio selected BL Lacs (Gopal-Krishna et\nal. 2003). Gupta et al. (2008) claimed detection of optical variability with an amplitude of 4.9% on one night, but since that\nlight curve remains steady, any such variability must be of the\nflicker type and not on hour-like time scale.\nIn the radio band, an unusual property highlighted for this BL\nLac is its remarkably flat radio spectrum, termed as \"cosmic conspiracy\" (Cotton et al. 1980).\n1.1. Radio morphology: kpc- to pc-scale\n\nPKS 0735+178 has been observed with radio interferometers at\nvarious frequencies. The 1.64 GHz VLA (Very Large Array) observations by Murphy et al. (1993) revealed a rather compact\nstructure, slightly elongated at a position angle of \u223c160 deg. The\n5 GHz MERLIN (Multi-Element Radio Linked Interferometer\nNetwork) image taken in 1983 is dominated by a core and also\nshows a very weak component to the southeast (B\u00e5\u00e5th & Zhang\n1991). The core-to-component flux density ratio is 200:1 and the\n\n\f2\n\nS. Britzen et al.: Understanding BL Lac objects\n\nposition angle of the component is \u2243160 deg - in agreement with\nthe VLA observations by Murphy et al. (1993). These observations established a large misalignment between the kpc-scale and\npc-scale structures of this source by \u223c 90-100 deg.\nPKS 0735+178 has been a favorite target of VLBI monitoring\nprograms, and striking changes in its nuclear jet are revealed\nfrom the more than two decades of its VLBI monitoring.\nB\u00e5\u00e5th & Zhang (1991) imaged the source at 5 GHz with global\nVLBI arrays at four epochs between 1979 and 1984. The large\nstructural changes thus found were interpreted by them in terms\nof relativistic (\u03b3 \u223c 8) motion of the radio knots along a curly\npath with a steadily decreasing viewing angle. Particularly instructive are their VLBI images of the inner 5 mas region, taken\nat the epochs 1981.9 and 1983.5, which (despite modest resolution) reveal a clear changeover from a kinky staircase profile in\n1981.9 to a straight mode in 1983.5 (see below). This morphological transition, first noted in the present work, is discussed in\nSect. 3.\nGabuzda et al. (1994) observed the source with the VLBA at the\nepochs 1987.41 (5 GHz), 1990.47 (8.4 GHz), and 1992.44 (5\nGHz). In all these observations, the source revealed a straight jet\nextending to the northeast. G\u00f3mez et al. (2001) present VLBA\nobservations at 8.4 and 43 GHz between August 1996 and May\n1998. Between March 1996 and May 2000 Agudo et al. (2006)\nobserved the source using the VLBA at frequencies between 5\nand 43 GHz. The observations by G\u00f3mez et al. and Agudo et\nal. show a twisted jet with two sharp apparent bends of 90deg\nwithin two milli-arcseconds of the core. Below we call this trajectory staircase mode. Between mid-1992 and mid 1995, the\njet trajectory changed again drastically from straight to staircase (G\u00f3mez et al. 2001). Unfortunately, no VLBI observations\ndocumenting this second transition are available.\nFrom early VLBI observations of this BL Lac object B\u00e5\u00e5th\n& Zhang (1991) estimated bulk Lorentz factors of up to \u223c 8h\u22121 c\nfor the knots in the VLBI jet, moving from the core towards a\nstationary component located \u223c 4 millisecond northeast of the\ncore. A subsequent paper by Gabuzda et al. (1994) reports an\napparent superluminal motion of \u22657.4 h\u22121 c of one knot. After\nmid-1995 the components show a tendency to cluster near several jet positions, remaining stationary in time (Sects. 3 and 4.2).\n1.2. The present work\n\nThe extensive VLBA coverage of this blazar at 15 GHz during\n1995-2009 under the MOJAVE program allowed us to undertake\na detailed probe of structural transitions in the nuclear jet of\nthis BL Lac object (Sect. 3). Thus, in addition to the last\ndocumented mode change in the pc-scale trajectory (G\u00f3mez et\nal. 2001), we found clear evidence for another mode change\nbetween 2000.4 and 2001.8. We find that from the staircase\nmode observed since mid 1995 the jet trajectory has reverted to\na straight morphology during the time interval covered by our\nVLBA data analysis, so that the timing of this morphological\nchange can be pinned down to an uncertainty of merely \u223c 1.6\nyears. In comparison, the uncertainty for the mode change\ninferred from the data of G\u00f3mez et al. was \u223c 3 years. According\nto them, the morphological transitions are most likely caused\nby pressure gradients in the external medium through which the\njet propagates. We discuss this hypothesis with regard to the\nmode transitions found by us. We further examine these mode\ntransitions gleaned from the VLBI data, as mentioned above,\nwith regard to the observed trends in the radio and optical\nlight-curves of this intensively monitored blazar.\n\nThis paper is organized in the following way: we first present\nthe results of our analysis of the archival VLBA data (MOJAVE)\nand point out the newly noticed correlations between the morphological and flux-density variations of this source. We then\ndiscuss our findings in the context of previously reported information about this blazar. In particular, we explore the connection\nbetween the peculiar mode changes and kinematics of its nuclear jet. Apparent transverse velocities (\u03b2app ) in this paper were\ncalculated with the one-year WMAP (Wilkinson Microwave\nAnisotropy Probe) data (Spergel et al., 2003); the values adopted\n2\n+0.008\nare h = 0.71+0.04\n\u22120.03 ; \u03a9m h = 0.135\u22120.009 ; \u03a9tot = 1.02 \u00b1 0.2. The\none-year and three-year WMAP parameters are less than 0.1c\nfor \u03bc = 0.1 mas yr\u22121 out to z = 4; this is small with respect to\nthe formal uncertainties in the apparent velocities.\n\n2. Data analysis\nWe analyzed the VLBA observations for 23 epochs, taken at 15\nGHz under the 2cm/MOJAVE survey between 1995 and 2009.\nThe data were model-fitted with the difmap model-fitting routine. To each epoch's VLBA image we attempted to fit the minimum number of components needed to describe the structure\nadequately to facilitate a least ambiguous component identification from epoch to epoch. For each image the model-fitting process started with a point-like source model. In order to keep the\ncomparison of the images for different epochs simple and credible, we assumed the components to be circular; highly elliptical\ncomponents are not likely anyway.\n\n\fS.

Estimation of the uncertainties\n\nAlthough the use of VLBA data generally ensures a high quality, considerable variation can occur between the epochs in both\nthe amount of data and its quality. The uncertainties were determined individually for each epoch by comparing the modelfit parameters for the sets with different numbers of components\n(\u00b11). For the uncertainties of the flux-density we assumed a minimum error of 5%. The positional uncertainty was determined\nby averaging 1/5th of the beam size and the value determined by\ncomparing several model-fit results. For the size we adopted an\nuncertainty of 10%. The model fit parameters and their uncertainties are given in Tables 3 and 4. We also list there the epoch\nof observation, the flux-density of each fitted component and its\nseparation from the core, the corresponding position angle, and\nthe component size.\n\n3. Results\nFigures 6 and 7 show the images derived by us, with the modelfit components superimposed. It is evident that the jet's morphology undergoes a drastic change during the time span covered by\n\nour observations. In Fig. 6 the jet shows the twice bent structure - the staircase mode, whereas in Fig. 7 the jet structure is\nseen to have become straight. Figure 1 a) shows the variation of\ncore separations between the epochs 1995.27 and 2008.91 for\nthe different components. Striking variations in the jet kinematics are seen during the period 1995 \u2013 2000.4. Four jet components clearly show outward directed motion with apparent superluminal speeds, while one component shows an inward motion\n(directed towards the core) also with an apparent superluminal\nspeed. The apparent speeds derived from linear regressions to\nthe component positions are given in Table 1. From 2001.8 on,\nonly four components can be identified in the VLBI jet, and the\njet components are found to be stationary (Figs. 6 and 7).\nFigure 1 b) presents the position angle (relative to the core) at\ndifferent epochs for each component. Again we find a significant\nchange to have occured between 2000.4 and 2001.8. Between\n1995 and 2000 the position angle distribution is quite broad with\nvalues ranging from \u223c10\u25e6 \u2013100\u25e6, which amounts to a wide spread\nof over \u223c90\u25e6 . After 2000.4, the position angle distribution is seen\nto become much narrower, with a total spread of just about 20\u25e6\naround a mean value of \u223c65\u25e6 .\nIn Fig. 1 c) the relation between the core separation and\nposition angle is plotted for each of the 23 epochs. This plot\nmore clearly depicts the two contrasting trends present in the\nVLBI images. Thus, a different pattern is observed for the\nepochs before 2000.4 and after 2000.4. Prior to 2000.4 all the\njet ridge lines show a similar form, with a clear minimum at\na core separation of \u223c1.5mas, where the position angle drops\nto \u223c 20\u25e6 . After 2000.4, the form of the jet ridge lines becomes\nalmost linear.\nThus, both the jet morphology and kinematics are found to\nchange remarkably between 1995 and 2009, as summarized\nbelow:\n1. In the staircase jet mode five radio knots/components move\nwith apparent superluminal speeds either away from the\ncore (four components), or towards it (one component). The\nposition angle distribution is broad (\u223c 90\u25e6 ). The jet ridge\nlines for all epochs before 2000.4 are similar, with a clear\nminimum in position angle.\n2. In the straight jet mode, separations of all four VLBI\ncomponents from the core remain essentially unchanged;\ntheir apparent speeds are sub-luminal. The position angle\ndistribution is narrow (\u223c 20\u25e6 ).\nIn Fig. 1 d) we present the same information as in Fig. 1 c), but\nfor selected epochs only: the two epochs before the mode change\nand the first three epochs following the mode change (2001.81,\n2001.98 and 2002.90). Here the different jet ridge lines for the\ntwo modes are seen more clearly. Figure 1 e) displays the evolution of flux-densities of the individual components and the core;\nagain significant changes are observed.\n3.1. Morphological transitions and flux-density variability\n\nThe BL Lac 0735+178 is known for its pronounced flux variability in both optical and radio bands (Ciprini et al. 2007; Goyal\net al. 2009). The origin of this variability, however, is still debated. To check for a possible correlation between the optical/radio flux-density variability and the morphological transitions witnessed in the VLBI observations, we show the light\n\n\fS.

Radio flux variability\n\nIn Fig. 1 f) the intergrated flux-densities at 4.8, 8.0, and 14.5\nGHz are plotted, monitored under the University of Michigan\nprogramme (UMRAO). The grey stripes denote the two most recent mode transition events. Based on the VLBI images reported\nhere and in the literature (see above), one can deduce that the first\nof these mode transitions (straight to staircase) occured sometime between mid-1992 and mid-1995, and hence its time-scale\nmust be less than three years. Likewise, the latest mode transition (staircase to straight) we report in this paper took less than\ntwo years. The time interval between the two transitions is \u223c7.5\nyears.\nIn Fig. 2 we show a plot adopted from Goyal et al. (2009)\nand indicate in it all three known mode transitions within pairs of\nvertical black lines. The 2001 transition occured shortly before\na clear radio flare. The 1994 transition occured shortly before\na clear modest radio flare. The 1983 mode transition cannot be\nrelated to a significant radio flare. While the corelation between\nthe times of the transititons and the optical flaring is convincing,\nthe case is not so clear with regard to a possible correlation\nwith radio flares. It seems that for the last two transitions the\nradio flares are delayed with regard to the optical flare, which\ncould be explained by propagation effects within the source.\nUnfortunately only one VLBI observation - the observation by\nGabuzda et al. (1994) from 1990.47 - is available for the time\nof the most prominent radio flaring around 1990. This would\nhelp to understand the relation between the radio flaring and\nthe morphological changes. A simultaneous monitoring of the\nradio and optical flux in combination with multi radio frequency\nVLBI observation is required for a better understanding of the\nemission processes.\n\n3.1.2. Correlation with optical flux variability\n\nIn Fig. 2(a, b) we reproduce the optical light curves from Goyal\net al. (2009), on which we have marked the three known mode\ntransitions mentioned above. Both staircase to straight mode\nchanges clearly take place near the brightness maxima. The optical flares coincident with these two transitions are more prominent compared to the middle flare coincident with the opposite\nmode transition. We thus find that a strong correlation exists between the structural change in the parsec-scale jet and the optical\nlight curve. To our knowledge, such a correlation has not been\n\n5\n\npointed out earlier for any jet, and this underscores the importance of long-term, coordinated VLBI and optical monitoring of\nblazars.\nThe origin of this conspicuous correlation in this source needs\nto be investigated in greater detail. This correlation could be explained by a small change in the direction to the line of sight.\nThis would change the amplification of intrisinc jet bending and\nalso allow for a more direct view into the inner regions of the\nAGN. This \"geometric\" explanation should be explored further.\nWhile more subtle interpretations are possible, a simple possibility to understand this correlated radio-optical behavior is that\nthe optical flare manifests an impulse by which a large amount of\nkinetic power (momentum flux) is injected by the central engine\ninto the nuclear jet, as a result of which the jet gets stretched\ninto a linear shape. This explanation is related to the question\nof higher stability of powerful jets and the collimation process\nof jets in general (e.g., Nakamura & Meier 2009). The observed\ntime lag between the optical flare and the disappearance of the\njet's kink could in fact be quite small (< 1 yr), since the jet flow\nin blazars is directed close to the line-of-sight, which is also the\ndirection of propagation of the optical signal recorded. An alternative scenario is presented in Sect. 4.4. Either of these two\npossible models will also be required to explain the disappearance of superluminal motion following the mode transition to a\nstraight jet.\nThe proposed energetic impulse that straightens the kinky jet\ncould originate from the core. Assuming that 0735+178 is a helical jet, whose components are therefore seen at different viewing\nangles at the times of different mode transitions, then this could\nexplain the connection to the radio flares as well. The radio flare\nwould then not be caused by the ejection of a new component which is usually assumed - but by the Doppler factor changing\nwith the viewing angle.\n\n4. Discussion\n4.1. Morphological mode transitions\n\nPKS 0735+178 showed a kinky jet trajectory in the VLBI\nobservations in December 1981 and a straight jet trajectory\nin June 1983. Therefter, sometime between mid-1992 and\nmid-1995, the morphology changed back to kinky with two\nsharp bends of \u223c 90\u25e6 (staircase mode), within 2 msec of the\ncore. Between 2000.4 and 2001.8 the jet trajectory changed\nonce again to the straight mode, as found in the present work.\nThus, three clear mode changes of the pc-scale trajectory of this\njet were observed. The time gaps between these transitions are\nabout 11.3 years and 7.2 years. A simple scenario for the mode\ntransition from kinky to straight jet was outlined in the previous\nsection, taking a clue from the observed coincidences of the\nmorphological transition events (kinky to straight jet) with the\noptical flares of this blazar. Below we present a kinematic model\nfor the latest mode transition revealed by our analysis of the\nVLBI observations taken at 23 epochs between 1995 to 2009\n(Sect. 4.4).\n\n4.2. Jet kinematics\n\nDuring the staircase mode, outward and inward apparent\nsuperluminal motion is observed. During the straight mode,\nthe separations of various knots/components from the core\nremained essentially unchanged. Whether these components are\nthe same or different, cannot be decided with absolute certainty.\n\n\f6\n\nS. Britzen et al.: Understanding BL Lac objects\n\nHowever, should the mode transition be caused by a changing\nviewing angle - a possibility argued below - the components\ncould be the same.\nA similar phenomenon - rather stationary components relative\nto the core, but moving perpendicular to the jet ridge line - was\nstudied by us in the two prominent BL Lac objects, 1803+784\n(Britzen et al., 2009) and 0716+714 (Britzen et al., 2009).\nOver a time of \u223c 20 years we do find rather slow apparent\nmotion or stationarity for nearly all of the components in the\npc-scale jet of 1803+784. However, the components are seen\nto move significantly in position angle measured from the core.\nThe entire ridge line of the jet thus evolves in the transverse\ndirection, changing from a straight line to an almost sinusoidal\nform and back again to a straight line. These significant jet\nridge-line changes occur on a timescale of \u223c 8 years. A similar\nphenomenon was studied by us in the highly variable BL Lac\n0716+714. Here again we find rather stationary components\nthat do, however, show motion in position angle and, once\nagain, the jet's ridge line evolves. We expect that the stationary\ncomponents can be explained in terms of a geometric origin. In\nthe past, various mechanisms were proposed to explain slow or\nsubluminal apparent motions. Smaller apparent speeds can be\nobtained by a flux-weighted integration of the apparent motions\nover the entire jet width (Gopal-Krishna et al. 2004). For a brief\nreview we refer to Britzen et al. (2008) and references therein.\nDifferent studies have reached opposite conclusions on whether\nBL Lac objects typically have slow or fast jet components\n(e.g., Gabuzda et al. 1994; Wehrle et al. 1992; Ghisellini et\nal. 1993; Jorstad et al. 2001). The CJF (Caltech-Jodrell Bank\nFlat-Spectrum) survey of 293 AGN (Britzen et al. 2008) shows\nsome tendency for smaller apparent velocities of BL Lac objects\ncompared to quasars. However, the small size of the BL Lac\nsample handicaps the comparison.\n\n4.3. A \"hybrid\" between quasars and BL Lac objects?\n\nAs noted in the previous subsection, there has been an ongoing\ndebate in recent years whether BL Lac objects and Quasars reveal similar kinematic properties or whether the apparent speeds\ndiffer significantly. According to the general picture of the AGN\nparadigm, fast apparent speeds with values up to \u223c30c can be\nobserved (e.g., Piner et al. 2006) and in almost all cases the motion is directed away from the assumed stationary core. This is\nin contrast to what we find in a growing number of BL Lac objects. Based on our analysis of 0735+178 presented here and the\ndetailed studies of 1803+784 and 0716+714, it is possible that\nthe kinematic properties are significanlty different. 0735+178 is\na \"hybrid\" with regard to the mode changes and the accompanying kinematics - it shows 'quasar'-like fast apparent motions at\ncertain periods of time and then again 'slow' motion (as we find\nin BL Lac objects) at other times. Thus this source switches between the different states that we tend to associate with quasars\nor BL Lac objects. Due to this atypical behavior, 0735+178 can\nhelp us to understand the difference between these two types of\nAGN. It is often assumed that the basic difference between these\ntwo classes is based on a different line of sight to the object,\nwith the BL Lacs being seen under the smallest angle to the line\nof sight (Unified Schemes). Within this scheme, it is then quite\nconceivable that the mode changes are caused by small changes\nin the angle to the line of sight, e.g., the jet bends slightly towards or away from us. Undoubtedly, 0735+178 is an extreme\nobject since these changes of the angle can not be very considerable in the source frame. Thus, 0735+178 might already be\n\nFig. 3. This figure is reproduced from Gong (2008) and shows\nthe difference between ballistic and non-ballistic motion. The\nmodel of ballistic motion plus precession is represented by the\nsolid spiral connecting the features a, b, and c. Denoted by the\ndashed ellipse through feature b is the non-ballistic model which\nprecesses with a constant distance to the core.\noriented in a critical angle towards us. This would explain why\nthis is the only source so far where these mode fluctutations have\nbeen observed.\n4.4. Helix or pressure gradients in the external medium?\n\nGong (2008) proposed a non-ballistic model (see Fig. 3), in\nwhich a continuous jet produces discrete hotspots via the interaction of the relativistic outflow with the ambient medium.\nThereby significant bulk energy of the jet is transferred to the\nswept up material. The precession of the jet axis results in the\nmotion of hotspots at different directions along the precession\ncone, which resembles a hotspot moving along a ring-like trajectory. Significant bulk energy loss may occur repeatedly for\na continuous jet with a fixed axis, leading to several distinct\nhotspots at different distances from the core. The precession of\nsuch a continuous jet results, on the other hand, in the motion of\nhotspot at different rings and with different precession phases (a\ndetailed analysis is in preparation).\nUnder this scenario, the rectangular structure is just a state\nof the motion of these hotspots in different rings, which can appear and disappear depending on the precession phases of these\nhotspots and their projections on the sky plane. Thus, conceivably, the non-ballistic model of Gong (2008) can provide a fairly\nsimple explanation for the appearance of the staircase mode.\nFigure 4 shows the observation of the BL Lac object\n0735+178 at 8.4 GHZ by G\u00f3mez et al. (2001) as well as the\ncurves fitted to the data. The inner components K8, K6 and K5\n- as defined in G\u00f3mez et al. (2001) - are fitted within the nonballistic model (Gong 2008) by three solid curves (corresponding to ring 1, ring 2 and ring 3, respectively) at different distances\nto the core. The evolution of the three curves is clockwise, all of\nthem start in 1988.47 and end in 2002.97.\nUnder the simplest treatment, the non-ballistic model just\ngives the same opening angle for the precession cone for the\nthree rings, \u03bb1 = \u03bb2 = \u03bb3 . However, in this case the morphology\nof PKS 0735+178 cannot be fitted well.\nThanks to the scenario of the pressure gradients in the external medium through which the jet propagates (G\u00f3mez et al.\n2001), it is reasonable to assume that \u03bb1 , \u03bb2 , \u03bb3 can deviate from\n\n\fS.

Since each component in the staircase mode\ncorresponds to a knot ejected previously, it should not have remained stationary. The staircase mode may induce pressure gradients in the medium through which the jet propagates, triggered by its own interaction with the ambient medium. In this\ncase, gradual changes in the position and curvature of the jet\nbends near K8 and K6 with time can be expected (G\u00f3mez et\nal. 2001). Plausibly, such a scenario could be responsible for\nthe small angle variations of the jet. However, to explain the\ntwo 90 degree bends would require very special conditions in\nthe ambient medium, making it hard to understand why such\nan ambient medium existed only during 1992-2000, but was\nabsent before mid-1992 and again after 2001. As pointed out\nby G\u00f3mez et al. (2001), the moving-component scenario suggests very non-ballistic trajectories for K5 and K6. But there are\nstill unanswered questions concerning the origin of these nonballistic trajectories. Are they caused by continuous or discret\nejection events, and what role, if any, is played by the jet precession? Further detailed investigations and modeling is required to\nanswer these questions.\n4.5. Timescales: Flux-density variability and mode change\n\nTable 2.

Under these circumstances, the evolution of the staircase mode can be well fitted, as shown in Fig. 4.\nThe input parameters to this model are given in Table 2.\nThe precession speed, \u03a9\u0307, is in units of deg/yr, the distance\nof a hotspot to the core, Ri , is in units of mas, and all other parameters are in units of degree. i is the inclination angle between\nthe jet's rotation axis and the line of sight; \u03be is the coordinate\ntransformation angle; \u03bbi is the opening angle of the precession\ncone; \u03b7i is the initial phase.\nAlthough Fig. 5 shows the fit to the 8.4 GHz observations of\nG\u00f3mez et al. (2001), the theoretical trajectory (Fig. 5 h) can be\nextended to up to 2009.63. By doing this, the disappearance of\nthe staircase observed at 15.335 GHz and 15.365 GHz (symbolized by the ellipses) at the end of 2001 can also be explained as\nshown in Fig. 5. This figure shows the evolution of the jet ridge\nline based on the observed morphology (filled filled squares and\nellipses) and the model (open squares). For the time of 2009.637\nthe model prediction is shown in the last panel of this figure.\nThis figure distinctly shows the different morphological phases\nof the jet ridge line as they are observed and how well they can\nbe reproduced within the model.\nConsequently, the staircase mode occurs when the hotspot\nprecesses to certain phases so that the projected appearance is\nrectangular. Likewise, the staircase mode disappears when the\nhotspot precesses to other phases where the projection deviates from the rectangular image. Obviously, the precession of\na hotspot varies the angle of the jet axis from the line of sight.\nThis leads to a varying Doppler boosting, which explains the\nobserved radio flux-density changes. The non-ballistic model,\nas outlined before, can explain the observed phenomena. When\n\nThe three drastic mode changes are clearly correlated with\nmaxima in the optical light-curve. Thus we assume that the\noptical emission (most likely emergent from the core) causes\nthe change in the trajectory. In two cases, a major long-term\nradio flux outburst occurs shortly after a mode change has\nappeared and this can be explained within the non-ballistic\nmotion scenario of hotspots outlined in the previous subsection.\nIn the optical emission, Fan et al. (1997) and Qian & Tao (2004)\nfound periodic features of 13.8-14.2 years. This is roughly twice\nthe time interval we find here between the two mode transitions.\nA physical connection between the morphological changes\n(mode changes) and the flux variability in the radio and the\noptical regime is thus likely.\nAccording to conventional wisdom, radio outbursts are explained as correlated with the ejection of a new radio component\nfrom the core. However, in PKS 0735+178 we found a similar\nnumber of components over a time span of roughly 14 years and\nno new components were unequivocally detected during this\nperiod. In addition, we find a correlation with the morphological\nchanges described as mode changes. Furthermore, we are able\nto explain the flux-density changes within the model by Gong et\nal. (2008) of non-ballistically moving hotspots. Thus, it can be\ninferred that in PKS 0735+178 ejection of VLBI components\nfrom the core is not required to explain the observed (quasiperiodic) radio flaring.\nWe found similar results for the other well-known blazars,\n1803+784 and 0716+714 - the long-term radio variability can\nbe correlated with morphological changes in the nuclear jet and\nis hence also likely to be of geometric origin. We thus find in\nthree BL Lac objects supporting evidence for a correlation between long-term radio variability and morphological changes\nthat are likely to be of geometric origin. Additional contribution\nto morphological changes, particularly the more abrupt ones,\ncould come from short bursts of power injected into the jet by\nthe central engine, manifested by the optical flaring events.\n\n\fS.

The observed morphology of 0735+178 is indicated by filled squares and ellipses, corresponding to the VLBI observations\nat 8.4 GHz (1990-1998) and at 15 GHz (2000-2007). The evolution of the trajectory of hotspots (hollowed square) from 1990 to\n2009 is reproduced in terms of the non-ballistic model.\n\n5. Conclusions\n\u2013 We report a third (and the most clear) event of structural\nmode transition in the nuclear jet of the BL Lac object PKS\n0735+178. In particular, we find that the twice sharply bent\ntrajectory of the nuclear jet transformed into a straight jet\nsometime between 200.4 and 2001.8.\n\u2013 From a literature search we further found that a similar transition from a kinky to a straight jet is present in the VLBI\nobservations of this source performed at 5 GHz in December\n1981 and June 1983.\n\u2013 Contrasting kinematic properties are found associated with\nthe two morphological modes of the nuclear jet: in the staircase mode apparent superluminal motion of the knots in the\njets is observed, either directed away from the core or towards it. In the straight mode, however, the knots remain\nfairly stationary relative to the core. Their position angle distribution is broad in the former case (\u223c 90\u25e6 ) and narrow in\nthe latter (\u223c 20\u25e6 ).\n\u2013 The time interval between the mode changes is \u223c 11.3 years\nbetween the first two mode changes and \u223c 7.2 years between\nthe last two mode changes.\n\n\u2013 Both mode changes, from kinky to straight jet, are found to\ncoincide with individual, well-defined peaks in the optical\nlight-curve. This points to a causal connection between the\noptical flaring and the structural changes in the nuclear jet.\n\u2013 The last two mode changes are seen to occur shortly before\nmajor radio outbursts.\n\u2013 Remarkably, no new radio knot/component was observed\nduring the entire time span (1995.27 to 2008.91) covered by\nthe VLBI images presented in this study - the components\nin the staircase-mode are fairly unambiguously identifiable\nwith the set of components witnessesd in the straight mode.\nA smooth transition was shown in this paper, which could\nbe explained by a (most likely curling) jet with a changing\nviewing angle.\n\u2013 The kinematics of the VLBI knots were modeled within the\nnon-ballistic motion scenario (Gong et al. 2008).\n\u2013 The long-term radio flux variability can be explained by\nDoppler boosting effects arising from the precession of the\nnuclear jet.\n\u2013 The model of non-ballistic motion of hotspots explains the\nvariability of flux-density and morphology, the significant\n\n\fS. Britzen et al.: Understanding BL Lac objects\n\nmorphological changes and the unusual kinematics of the\nnuclear jet in PKS0735+178.\n\u2013 Similar kinematic properties - fairly stationary components\n- and a correlation between periodic ridge line changes and\nthe long-term radio outbursts were found by some of us for\ntwo other well-known blazars: 1803+784 and 0716+714.\nAcknowledgements.
