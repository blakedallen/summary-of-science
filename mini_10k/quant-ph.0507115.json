However, this approach is best known\nin its application to non-relativistic quantum mechanics [1, 2], in which particle paths\nare parametrized by coordinate time. A natural relativistic generalization is to consider\nparametrized paths in four-dimensional spacetime rather than time-parametrized paths in\nthree-dimensional space. Feynman himself developed such an approach, and this conception\nseems to have informed much of Feynman's early view of relativistic quantum mechanics\n[3, 4, 5].\nAt an even earlier date, Stueckelberg presented a detailed formulation of relativistic\nquantum mechanics in terms of parametrized spacetime paths [6, 7]. A number of other\nauthors (notably [8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18]) have also developed related\napproaches involving an invariant \"fifth parameter\" governing the evolution of a quantum\nsystem, though not necessarily identifying this explicitly as a path parameter.\nA key feature of these approaches is that time is treated comparably to the three space\ncoordinates, rather than as an evolution parameter. This is particularly applicable to the\nstudy of quantum gravity and cosmology, in which the fundamental equations (such as the\nWheeler-DeWitt equation) make no explicit distinction for the time coordinate (see, e.g.,\n[19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25]).\nAlso, in the infinite-tension limit, string theory reduces to a worldline formalism for\nrelativistic quantum theory [26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32]. One would therefore expect a path\nformulation of relativistic quantum mechanics to provide a natural bridge to the typically\nfirst-quantized formulation of string theory.\nDespite the promise of the approach, spacetime path formalisms have often been presented in the literature as simply alternative formulations of results obtained from the more\ntraditional quantum field theory formalism. The motivation of the present paper, however, is\nto construct a first-quantized spacetime path formalism that can be considered foundational\nin its own right. This means that many typical tools of field theory, such as Hamiltonian\ndynamics and the Lagrangian stationary action principle for fields, cannot be assumed to\napply a priori.\nInstead, we will begin with the fundamental principles of special-relativistic quantum\n2\n\n\ftheory-the Born probability rule, superposition, and Poincar\u00e9 invariance-and introduce\nsix additional, physically motivated postulates related to spacetime paths. (The perhaps\neven more fundamental question of why quantum probabilities are given via superpositions\nof probability amplitudes will not be addressed here.) Results deduced from these postulates\nthen provide the basis for further physical interpretation.\nSince this formalism is first quantized, particular care is given to properly handling particles and antiparticles and to developing a consistent probabilistic interpretation. The result\nis an approach that fully deals with the usual issues of negative energies and negative probabilities, but without necessitating the introduction of fields as fundamental entities. Rather,\nfields can be considered to be simply a convenient formalism for handling multiparticle\nstates. The present work only discuses massive scalar particles, but the approach can be\nextended to handle non-scalar particles (e.g., [33, 34]).\nSection II first introduces the formalism for free scalar particles, culminating in free\nmultiparticle fields. Section III then extends the formalism to consider interacting states\nand scattering. In order to reduce clutter in the text, certain propositions resulting from\npurely mathematical, but somewhat involved, derivation are cited without proof in the main\nbody of the text, with proofs given in appendices.\nNatural units with ~ = 1 = c are used throughout the following and the metric has a\nsignature of (\u2212 + ++).\n\nII.\n\nFREE PARTICLES\n\nFor any path based approach, it is obviously critical to be clear on what is meant by the\nterm path. In the present case, a path for a particle is an arbitrary curve through spacetime,\nthat is, a continuous (though not necessarily differentiable), one-dimensional subspace of\nspacetime. Note that there is no a priori requirement that such a curve is timelike or\nlightlike. Indeed, the path may cross arbitrarily forwards and backwards in time. Since\nsuch a path is continuous, there is a one-to-one mapping between it and some interval of the\nreal numbers. That is, a path may be given by functions q \u03bc (\u03bb), for \u03bc = 0, 1, 2, 3, of a path\nparameter \u03bb.\nIn this formulation, the path parameter \u03bb serves a purpose similar to that of time in\nthe traditional non-relativistic path integral approach [2]. For the restricted case of an\n3\n\n\feverywhere-timelike path, this parameter is analogous to proper time. For the general case\nof an unrestricted path, there has been some debate as to the physical nature of the path\nparameter (see, for example, [35, 36]). In order not to presuppose any specific interpretation,\nwe will consider, for each path, all possible parameterizations of the path.\nTo do this, choose a fiducial parametrization s, say over the interval [0, 1], and define\nany other parametrization as a monotonically increasing function \u03bb(s). Geometrically, the\nso called lapse multiplier\nw(s) \u2261\n\nd\u03bb\n>0\nds\n\nthen gives an effective length metric d\u03bb = w(s)ds for the path, and the corresponding\nparametrization \u03bb is an intrinsic length measure along the path.\nGiven this basic conception of a particle path, this section will review the fundamental\npostulates required for a path integral approach, derive the scalar free particle propagator\nand carefully consider the corresponding probability interpretation.\n\nA.\n\nThe Free Particle Propagator\n\nThe fundamental postulate of any spacetime path integral approach is that a particle's\ntransition amplitude between two points in spacetime is a superposition of the transition\namplitudes for all possible paths between those points. Let the functional \u2206[q] give the\ntransition amplitude for a path q \u03bc (\u03bb). Then the total transition amplitude \u2206(x, x0 ) must\nbe given by a path integral over \u2206[q], for all paths q from x0 to x.\nPostulate 1. For a free scalar particle, the transition amplitude \u2206(x, x0 ) is given by the\nsuperposition of path transition amplitudes \u2206[q], for all possible 4-dimensional path functions\nq \u03bc (\u03bb) beginning at x0 and ending at x, parametrized by all possible monotonically increasing\nfunctions \u03bb(s). That is,\n\u2206(x, x0 ) =\n\nZ\n\n\u0015\nd\u03bb\nF [\u03bb]\u2206(x, x0 ; [\u03bb]) ,\nD\u03bb \u03b8\nds\n\u0014\n\n(1)\n\nwhere the real-valued functional F [\u03bb] allows for the possibility of different weights for different\nparametrizations, and\n\u2206(x, x0 ; [\u03bb]) \u2261 \u03b7[\u03bb]\n\nZ\n\nD4 q \u03b4 4 (q(\u03bb(1)) \u2212 x)\u03b4 4 (q(\u03bb(0)) \u2212 x0 )\u2206[q] ,\n\n4\n\n(2)\n\n\fwhere \u03b7[\u03bb] is a parametrization-dependent normalization factor as required to keep the path\nintegral finite.\nNote that, in Eqs. (1) and (2), the notation D\u03bb indicates a path integral over the parameterization function \u03bb(s) while D4 q indicates a path integral over the four path functions\nq \u03bc (\u03bb).\nIn the traditional Feynman sum-over-paths approach, the form of \u2206[q] is simply assumed\nto be an exponential of the classical action [2]. This is justified because the resulting transition amplitudes agree with the results of the usual formulation of quantum mechanics.\nHowever, if the path-based formulation is to be considered foundational, one would prefer a\nmore fundamental justification.\nAs a transition amplitude, \u2206[q] strictly only applies to a particle on a specific path q\nfrom the starting position q(\u03bb0 ) to the ending position q(\u03bb1 ) (where the parameter range\nof q is [\u03bb0 , \u03bb1 ]). However, by translational invariance in Minkowski spacetime, the particle\npropagation embodied in \u2206[q] cannot depend on the absolute positions q(\u03bb), but only on\nthe relative positions\n\u2206q(\u03bb) \u2261 q(\u03bb) \u2212 q(\u03bb0 ) .\nThat is, we can take \u2206[q] = \u2206[\u2206q].\nNow, consider a family of parallel paths qx0 , indexed by the starting position x0 , such\nthat\nqx0 (\u03bb) = x0 + \u2206q(\u03bb) ,\nfor a fixed relative position function \u2206q. Since all members of such a family have the\nsame relative position function \u2206q, the amplitude \u2206[qx0 ] = \u2206[\u2206q] must be the same for all\nmembers of the family.\nSuppose that a probability amplitude \u03c8(x0 ) is given for a particle to be at an initial\nposition x0 and that the transition amplitude is known to be \u2206[\u2206q] for a specific relative\nposition function \u2206q. Then, the probability amplitude for the particle to traverse a specific\npath qx0 from the family for relative position \u2206q is just \u2206[qx0 ]\u03c8(x0 ) = \u2206[\u2206q]\u03c8(x0 ).\nHowever, the very meaning of being on the specific path qx0 is that the particle must\npropagate from the starting position at x0 to the ending position at qx0 (\u03bb1 ). Therefore, the\nprobability for reaching the end position qx0 (\u03bb1 ) must be the same as the probability for\n\n5\n\n\fhaving started out at the position x0 . That is,\n|\u2206[\u2206q]\u03c8(x0 )|2 = |\u03c8(x0 )|2 .\nBut, since \u2206[\u2206q] is independent of x0 , we must have |\u2206[q]|2 = 1 in general.\nOf course, this argument is really just a suggestive motivation rather than a proof, so we\ntake the conclusion as a postulate, rather than a proposition.\nPostulate 2. For any path q \u03bc (\u03bb), the transition amplitude \u2206[q] preserves the position probability density for the particle along the path. That is, it satisfies\n|\u2206[q]|2 = 1 .\n\n(3)\n\nIf the configuration space for a path is expanded to be a representation of the full Poincar\u00e9\ngroup-that is, to include a matrix representation of the (homogeneous) Lorentz group as\nwell as the four spacetime coordinates-then members of a family of \"parallel\" paths are\nrelated by Poincar\u00e9 transformations, not just translations. This can be used as the basis\nfor extending the spacetime path formalism to cover non-scalar particles. If, further, the\nassumption of flat spacetime is dropped, then it is not generally possible to construct a\nfamily of parallel paths covering all spacetime. However, one can still consider infinitesimal\nvariations along a path corresponding to arbitrary coordinate transformations. Such further\ngeneralizations of the spacetime path approach will be explored in future papers.\nThe requirements of Eq. (3) and translation invariance mean that \u2206[q] must have the\nform\n\u2206[q] = eiS[\u2206q] ,\nfor some phase functional S. Substituting Eq. (4) into Eq. (2) gives\nZ\n\u2206(x, x0 ; [\u03bb]) = \u03b7[\u03bb] D4 q \u03b4 4 (q(\u03bb(1)) \u2212 x)\u03b4 4 (q(\u03bb(0)) \u2212 x0 )eiS[\u2206q] .\n\n(4)\n\n(5)\n\nSo far, we have made no assumption that the particle path functions q \u03bc (\u03bb) are differentiable. Indeed, paths under a path integral will generally not be differentiable. Nevertheless,\nit is common practice to use (with some care) path derivatives in the integrand of a path\nintegral. This is because a path integral is defined as the limit of discretized approximations\nin which path derivatives are approximated as the mean value \u2206q/\u2206\u03bb, for finite differences\n\u2206q and \u2206\u03bb. The limit \u2206\u03bb \u2192 0 is then taken over the path integral as a whole, not each\n6\n\n\fderivative individually. Thus, even though lim\u2206\u03bb\u21920 \u2206q/\u2206\u03bb may not be defined, the path\nintegral has a well-defined value so long as the overall path integral limit is defined. (For a\ndiscussion of some of the issues involved here, see, for example, Section 7.3 of [2]. See also\nthe explicit example of the derivation in App. B.)\nWe are therefore justified in replacing the difference functions \u2206q \u03bc (\u03bb) used in the phase\nfunctional under the path integral in Eq. (5) with the path derivatives q\u0307 \u03bc (\u03bb) \u2261 dq \u03bc /d\u03bb, such\nthat\n\u03bc\n\n\u2206q (\u03bb) =\n\u03bc\n\nZ\n\n\u03bb\n\nd\u03bb\u2032 q\u0307 \u03bc (\u03bb\u2032 ) ,\n\u03bb0\n\nletting the q (\u03bb) be considered as differentiable. This gives\nZ\n\u2206(x, x0 ; [\u03bb]) = \u03b7[\u03bb] D4 q \u03b4 4 (q(\u03bb(1)) \u2212 x)\u03b4 4 (q(\u03bb(0)) \u2212 x0 )eiS[q\u0307] .\n\n(6)\n\nwhich reflects the typical form of a Feynman sum over paths [2], where each path is weighted\nby a phase determined by the action S. Unlike the usual non-relativistic formulation, however, the path parameter here is \u03bb, rather than time [5, 21].\nNow, by dividing a path q into two paths at some arbitrary parameter value \u03bb and\npropagating over each segment, we can see that\nS[q\u0307; \u03bb1 , \u03bb0 ] = S[q\u0307; \u03bb1 , \u03bb] + S[q\u0307; \u03bb, \u03bb0] ,\n\n(7)\n\nwhere S[q\u0307; \u03bb\u2032 , \u03bb] denotes the value of S[q\u0307] for the parameter range of q\u0307 restricted to [\u03bb, \u03bb\u2032 ].\nUsing this property to build the total value of S[q\u0307] from infinitesimal increments leads to\nthe following result (proved in App. A).\nProposition A (Form of the Phase Functional). The phase functional S must have the\nform\nS[q\u0307] =\n\nZ\n\n\u03bb1\n\nd\u03bb\u2032 L[q\u0307; \u03bb\u2032 ] ,\n\n(8)\n\n\u03bb0\n\nwhere the parametrization domain for q\u0307 is [\u03bb0 , \u03bb1 ] and L[q\u0307; \u03bb] depends only on q\u0307 and its\nhigher derivatives evaluated at \u03bb.\nThe question remains as to what form the function L should take. Traditionally, it is\ntaken to be just the classical Langrangian, but, from a foundational viewpoint, one would\nlike a better justification.\nOf course, the simplest form for L would be a constant, independent of q\u0307. However, this\nwould result in a superficially divergent path integral in Eq. (6) which, when normalized,\n7\n\n\fwould leave to just a trivial phase. This would not give any appropriate particle dynamics.\nThe next simplest form for L would be for it to depend only on q\u0307 and no higher derivatives.\nFurther, since L is a scalar quantity, it must then depend only on the Lorentz-invariant\nscalar function\nq\u0307 2 (\u03bb) \u2261 q\u0307 \u03bc (\u03bb)q\u0307\u03bc (\u03bb) .\nTaking L to further have the tractable form of a linear function of q\u0307 2 gives\nL[q\u0307; \u03bb] = L(q\u0307 2 (\u03bb)) = aq\u0307 2 (\u03bb) + b ,\nfor some a and b. Now, the factor a can be fixed arbitrarily, since any variation is effectively\nequivalent to a reparametrization of the path parameter \u03bb. For a free particle, it is convenient\nto take a = 1/4. If we further assume that b is always negative, we can set b = \u2212m2\nand identifying m with the mass of the particle does, indeed, give a classical relativistic\nLagrangian function.\nAs we will see in the following, evaluating the path integral in Eq. (6) with this Lagrangian\nfunction leads to the usual free-particle Feynman propagator for the particle. If, on the other\nhand, we take b to be positive, then the result is a similar propagator, but with an effective\nimaginary particle mass. Such particles are tachyons, which we will not consider further in\nthis paper.\nPostulate 3. For a free scalar particle of mass m, the Lagrangian function is given by\n1\nL(q\u0307 2 ) = q\u0307 2 \u2212 m2 .\n4\n\n(9)\n\nSubstituting Eq. (8) into Eq. (6) gives\nZ\nZ\n4\n4\n4\n\u2206(x, x0 ; [\u03bb]) = \u03b7[\u03bb] D q \u03b4 (q(\u03bb(1))\u2212x)\u03b4 (q(\u03bb(0))\u2212x0 ) exp i\n\n\u03bb(1)\n\n\u03bb(0)\n\nd\u03bb\u2032 L(q\u0307 2 (\u03bb\u2032 ))\n\n!\n\n. (10)\n\nWith the Lagrangian given by Eq. (9), it is well known that this path integral may be\nevaluated (see, for example, [21]). However, in the present context, some care must be taken\nto mathematically evaluate the integral without making any further assumptions based on\nfield equations or underlying traditional quantum mechanics. In any case, the result (proved\nin App. B) is as follows.\nProposition B (Evaluation of the Path Integral). The path integral in Eq. (10), with the\nLagrangian given by Eq. (9), may be evaluated to get\nZ\n2\n2\n\u22124\nd4 p eip*(x\u2212x0) e\u2212i[\u03bb(1)\u2212\u03bb(0)](p +m ) .\n\u2206(x, x0 ; [\u03bb]) = \u2206(x \u2212 x0 ; \u03bb(1) \u2212 \u03bb(0)) \u2261 (2\u03c0)\n8\n\n(11)\n\n\fNote that the only dependency left of \u2206(x \u2212 x0 ; \u03bb(1) \u2212 \u03bb(0)) on the parametrization \u03bb(s)\nis on the total intrinsic path length\nT = \u03bb(1) \u2212 \u03bb(0) =\n\nZ\n\n1\n\nds w(s) > 0 .\n\n0\n\nIf we were to take F [\u03bb] = 1 in Eq. (1) for all \u03bb(s), there would then be a parametrization\ngauge symmetry: all parametrizations that give the same intrinsic path lengths would be\nequivalent. Therefore, equivalent reparametrizations would be overcounted in the \u03bb path\nintegral of Eq. (1), so the integral would diverge.\nIf, on the other hand, the path integral over \u03bb had not been included at all in Eq. (1),\nthe result would have been to overspecify a specific path parametrization. The possible\nparticle paths would then have been undercounted, missing the need to include paths of\ndifferent intrinsic lengths. It is thus necessary to reduce the \u03bb path integration in Eq. (1)\nto eliminate the overcounting due to the path gauge symmetry, without overspecifying the\npath parametrization.\nIn the usual fashion for a gauge symmetry, we retain the integration, but fix a specific\nguage. This can be easily done by including a gauge fixing delta functional in F [\u03bb]. The\ngauge typically chosen is to require that w(s) = d\u03bb/ds be constant [21], which corresponds\nto setting\n\u0015\nd\u03bb\n\u2212 [\u03bb(1) \u2212 \u03bb(0)] ,\nF [\u03bb] = f (\u03bb(1) \u2212 \u03bb(0))\u03b4\nds\n\u0014\n\nfor some real function f (T ). Using this in Eq. (1) gives\nZ \u221e\n\u2206(x, x0 ) =\ndT f (T )\u2206(x \u2212 x0 ; T ) .\n0\n\nIn the following, we will generally assume equal weighting of all parametrizations, that is\nf (T ) = 1. However, in Sec. III D, we will see that an alternate choice provides a fruitful path\nfor regularizing the infinite integrals that appear in the formalism for interacting particles.\nNevertheless, assuming, for now, that f (T ) = 1, gives\nZ\nZ \u221e\nZ\n4\nip*(x\u2212x0 )\n\u22124\n\u2206(x, x0 ) =\nd pe\ndT \u2206(x \u2212 x0 ; T ) = (2\u03c0)\n0\n\n\u221e\n\ndT e\u2212iT (p\n\n2 +m2 )\n\n.\n\n(12)\n\n0\n\nThis can be evaluated by introducing a convergence factor exp(\u2212T \u03b5), for infinitesimal \u03b5,\nresulting in just the Feynman propagator\n\u2206(x, x0 ) = \u2206(x \u2212 x0 ) \u2261 \u2212i(2\u03c0)\n9\n\n\u22124\n\nZ\n\nd4 p\n\neip*(x\u2212x0 )\n.\np2 + m2 \u2212 i\u03b5\n\n\fThe integration of T from 0 to \u221e in Eq. (12) is similar to the integration carried out by\nNambu [9], based on previous work of Fock [8], in order to obtain the Feynman propagator.\nNote, though, that this integration arises naturally here as the guage-fixed reduction of the\npath parametrization integral in Eq. (1).\nThe relationship between the propagator \u2206(x \u2212 x0 ) and \u2206(x \u2212 x0 ; T ) can be viewed in\nanother way, which will also prove useful in Sec. III D.

(14)\np2 + m\u20322 \u2212 i\u03b5\n\nThis form for \u2206(x\u2212x0 ; T ) is essentially that of the parametrized Green's function derived by\nHorwitz et al. for parametrized quantum field theory [37, 38] as a superposition of propagators for different mass states (see also [39, 40]). Equation (13) differs from those references in\nthe factor exp(\u2212iT m2 ). As a result of this factor, integrating Eq. (13) over T as in Eq. (12)\neffectively acts as a Fourier transform, resulting in a propagator with mass sharply defined\nat m.\n\nB.\n\nFree Particle Position States\n\nThe path integral form for \u2206(x\u2212x0 ; \u03bb\u2212\u03bb0 ) given in Eq. (2) is essentially the same as that\nof the path integral for the non-relativistic kernel [2], except that \u03bb is used as the evolution\nparameter instead of t. Therefore, \u2206(x \u2212 x0 ; \u03bb \u2212 \u03bb0 ) has similar properties as a propagation\nkernel in \u03bb:\nZ\n\nd4 x1 \u2206(x \u2212 x1 ; \u03bb \u2212 \u03bb1 )\u2206(x1 \u2212 x0 ; \u03bb1 \u2212 \u03bb0 ) = \u2206(x \u2212 x0 ; \u03bb \u2212 \u03bb0 )\n\nand\n\u2206(x \u2212 x0 ; \u03bb \u2212 \u03bb0 )\u2217 = \u2206(x0 \u2212 x; \u03bb0 \u2212 \u03bb) .\n\n10\n\n\fGiven these properties, define a family of probability amplitude functions \u03c8(x; \u03bb), for\nwhich\n\u03c8(x; \u03bb) =\n\nZ\n\nd4 x0 \u2206(x \u2212 x0 ; \u03bb \u2212 \u03bb0 )\u03c8(x0 ; \u03bb0 ) ,\n\n(15)\n\nfor any \u03bb and \u03bb0 , normalized such that\nZ\nd4 x |\u03c8(x; \u03bb)|2 = 1 ,\n\n(16)\n\nfor each \u03bb. Formally, these functions are probability amplitudes for the position x, with\n\u03bb serving as an index identifying individual functions in the family. However, they can be\ninterpreted as just the parametrized probability amplitude functions defined by Stueckelberg\n[6]. In this sense, the \u03c8(x; \u03bb) represent the probability amplitude for a particle to reach\nposition x at the point along its path with parameter value \u03bb.\nNote that\n\u2202\ni \u2206(x \u2212 x0 ; \u03bb \u2212 \u03bb0 ) = (2\u03c0)\u22124\n\u2202\u03bb\n\nZ\n\nd4 p eip*(x\u2212x0) (p2 + m2 )e\u2212i(\u03bb\u2212\u03bb0 )(p\n\nThis means that \u03c8(x; \u03bb), as given by Eq. (15), satisfies\n\u0013\n\u0012 2\n\u2202\n\u2202\n2\n\u2212 m \u03c8(x; \u03bb) .\n\u2212 i \u03c8(x; \u03bb) =\n\u2202\u03bb\n\u2202x2\n\n2 +m2 )\n\n.\n\n(17)\n\nEquation (17) is a generalized Schr\u00f6dinger equation, such as proposed by Stueckelberg [7].\nHowever, Stueckelberg and subsequent authors [4, 12, 15] used a Hamiltonian of the form\n(2m)\u22121 \u2202 2 /\u2202x2 , by analogy with non-relativistic mechanics, rather than the form of Eq. (17)\n(though [41] uses a Hamiltonian form similar to Eq. (17)). This difference is the origin of\nthe extra factor exp(\u2212iT m2 ) in Eq. (13) relative to [37, 38].\nThe properties of the kernel \u2206(x \u2212 x0 ; \u03bb \u2212 \u03bb0 ) also allow for the definition of a consistent\nfamily of position state bases |x; \u03bbi, such that\n\u03c8(x; \u03bb) = hx; \u03bb|\u03c8i ,\n\n(18)\n\ngiven a single Hilbert space state vector |\u03c8i. These position states are normalized such that\nhx\u2032 ; \u03bb|x; \u03bbi = \u03b4 4 (x\u2032 \u2212 x) .\nfor each value of \u03bb. Further, it follows from Eqs. (15) and (18) that\n\u2206(x \u2212 x0 ; \u03bb \u2212 \u03bb0 ) = hx; \u03bb|x0 ; \u03bb0 i .\n11\n\n(19)\n\n\fThus, \u2206(x \u2212 x0 ; \u03bb \u2212 \u03bb0 ) effectively defines a unitary transformation between the various\nHilbert space bases |x; \u03bbi, indexed by the parameter \u03bb.\nFinally, the overall state for propagation from x0 to x is given by the superposition of the\nstates for paths of all intrinsic lengths. If we fix q \u03bc (\u03bb0 ) = x\u03bc0 , then |x; \u03bbi already includes all\npaths of length \u03bb \u2212 \u03bb0 . Therefore, the overall state |xi for the particle to arrive at x should\nbe given by the superposition of the states |x; \u03bbi for all \u03bb > \u03bb0 :\nZ \u221e\n|xi \u2261\nd\u03bb |x; \u03bbi .\n\n(20)\n\n\u03bb0\n\nThen, using Eq. (19),\nZ\nhx|x0 ; \u03bb0 i =\n\n\u221e\n\nd\u03bb \u2206(x \u2212 x0 ; \u03bb \u2212 \u03bb0 ) =\n\n\u03bb0\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\nd\u03bb \u2206(x \u2212 x0 ; \u03bb) = \u2206(x \u2212 x0 ) .\n\n(21)\n\n0\n\nNow, the |xi are not actually proper Hilbert space states, since hx|x0 i is infinite (as can\nbe see by integrating Eq. (21) over \u03bb0 ). Nevertheless, via Eq. (12), the corresponding bras\nhx| can be considered to be well-defined functions on proper, normalizable states |\u03c8i such\nthat\nhx|\u03c8i =\n\nZ\n\nd4 x0 \u2206(x \u2212 x0 )\u03c8(x0 ; \u03bb0 )\n\nis the transition amplitude for a particle with known probability amplitude \u03c8(x0 ; \u03bb0 ) at\n\u03bb0 to eventually reach position x at some \u03bb > \u03bb0 . We will thus continue to use |xi as a\nformal quantity, with the understanding that it is really just a shorthand for constructing\npropagators and transition amplitudes.\n\nC.\n\nOn-Shell Particle and Antiparticle States\n\nThe states constructed so far have naturally been off-shell states. That is, they represent what are normally considered to be \"virtual\" particles. However, rather than simply\nimposing the on-shell mass condition to obtain \"physical\" states, on-shell states will be constructed in this subsection as the infinite time limit of off-shell states. That is, particles with\npaths that, in the limit, are unbounded in time will turn out to be naturally on-shell.\nIn order to take a time limit, it is necessary to make some distinction between past and\nfuture that can be used as the basis for taking the limit. For this purpose, divide the set of\nall possible paths q \u03bc that end at some specific q \u03bc (\u03bb) = x\u03bc into two subsets: those that begin\n(at q \u03bc (\u03bb0 ) = x\u03bc0 ) in the past of x and those that begin in the future of x.\n12\n\n\fOutside of the light cone of x, the division into future and past is, of course, not Lorentz\ncovariant and depends on the choice of a specific coordinate system. However, when we take\nthe time limit, the light cone expands to cover all space, and, in this limit, the division into\nparticle and antiparticle becomes fully coordinate system independent. The possibility of\nthe particle/antiparticle distinction being coordinate system dependent in anything other\nthan the infinite time limit is a subject for future exploration.\nNow, particles are normally considered to propagate from the past to the future. On\nthe other hand, antiparticles may be considered to propagate from the future into the past\n[3, 6, 7].\nPostulate 4. Normal particle states |x+ i are such that\nhx+ |x0 ; \u03bb0 i = \u03b8(x0 \u2212 x00 )\u2206(x \u2212 x0 ) .\nAntiparticle states |x\u2212 i are such that\nhx\u2212 |x0 ; \u03bb0 i = \u03b8(x00 \u2212 x0 )\u2206(x \u2212 x0 ) .\nUsing the usual decomposition of the Feynman propagator (see, for example, Section 6.2\nof [42])\n\u2206(x \u2212 x0 ) = \u03b8(x0 \u2212 x00 )\u2206+ (x \u2212 x0 ) + \u03b8(x00 \u2212 x0 )\u2206\u2212 (x \u2212 x0 ) ,\nwhere\n\u2206\u00b1 (x \u2212 x0 ) \u2261 (2\u03c0)\nwith \u03c9p \u2261\n\n\u22123\n\nZ\n\n3\n\ndp\n\np\np2 + m2 , it is clear that\n\nei[\u2213\u03c9p (x\n\n(22)\n\n0 \u2212x0 )+p*(x\u2212x )]\n0\n0\n\n2\u03c9p\n\n,\n\nhx\u00b1 |x0 ; \u03bb0 i = \u03b8(\u00b1(x0 \u2212 x00 ))\u2206(x \u2212 x0 ) = \u03b8(\u00b1(x0 \u2212 x00 ))\u2206\u00b1 (x \u2212 x0 ) .\n\n(23)\n\n(24)\n\nWe would now like to take the time limits for future and past directed particle and\nantiparticle states. In doing this, one cannot expect to hold the 3-position of the path end\npoint constant. However, for a free particle, it is reasonable to take the particle 3-momentum\nas being fixed. Therefore, consider the state of a particle or antiparticle with a 3-momentum\np at a certain time t.

Such on-shell particles are unambiguously normal particles or\nantiparticles, independent of choice of coordinate system. (Note that these states are similar\nto the \"mass representation\" states of [12].)\nNote also that the factor of exp(\u2213i\u03c9pt) in the definition of |t, p\u00b1 i (Eq. (25)) is not arbitrary. Without this, a factor of exp(\u00b1i\u03c9pt) would remain in Eq. (32), making it impossible\nto take the limit t \u2192 \u00b1\u221e.\n\nD.\n\nOn-Shell Probability Interpretation\n\nUnfortunately, the states defined in Eq. (33) are not normalizable using the usual inner\nproduct, since\nhp\u2032\u00b1 |p\u00b1 i = 2\u03c0(2\u03c9p)\u22122 \u03b4(0)\u03b4 3 (p\u2032 \u2212 p)\nis infinite. In [12], this is handled by allowing the mass m to vary, even though the energy\np\nis fixed at p2 + m2 . Here we will take a different approach, noting that, from Eq. (28),\nhp\u2032 ; \u03bb|p; \u03bbi = \u03b4 4 (p\u2032 \u2212 p) .\n\nUsing this and Eq. (33), we clearly have\nhp\u00b1 |p0 ; \u03bb0 i = (2\u03c0)1/2 (2\u03c9p)\u22121 \u03b4(\u00b1\u03c9p \u2212 p00 )\u03b4 3 (p \u2212 p0 ) .\n15\n\n(34)\n\n\fMoreover, from this equation and Eq. (27),\nZ\n0\n\u22121/2 \u2213i\u03c9p t0\ndp00 eip0 t0 (2\u03c0)1/2 (2\u03c9p)\u22121 \u03b4(\u00b1\u03c9p \u2212 p00 )\u03b4 3 (p \u2212 p0 )\nhp\u00b1 |t0 , p0\u00b1 ; \u03bb0 i = (2\u03c0)\ne\n\n(35)\n\n\u22121 3\n\n= (2\u03c9p) \u03b4 (p \u2212 p0 ) ,\nfor any value of t0 . This is essentially the basis for an \"induced\" inner product, in the sense\nof [23, 43].\nLet H be the Hilbert space of the |x; \u03bb0 i and let Ht be the subspaces spanned by the\n|t, x; \u03bb0i, for each t, forming a foliation of H. Now, from Eq. (27), it is clear that the particle\nand antiparticle 3-momentum states |t, p\u00b1 ; \u03bb0 i also each span Ht . In these representations,\nstates in Ht have the form\n|t, \u03c8\u00b1 ; \u03bb0 i =\n\nZ\n\nd3 p \u03c8(p)|t, p\u00b1 ; \u03bb0 i ,\n\n(36)\n\nfor square-integrable functions \u03c8(p). Conversely, it follows from Eq. (35) that a probability\namplitude \u03c8(p) is given by\n\u03c8(p) = (2\u03c9p)hp\u00b1 |t, \u03c8\u00b1 ; \u03bb0 i .\n\n(37)\n\nLet Ht\u2032 be the space of linear functions dual to Ht . Via Eq. (37), the bra states hp\u00b1 | can\n\u2032\nbe considered to be members of Ht\u2032 , for all t. Indeed, they span two common subspaces H\u00b1\n\nof the Ht\u2032 , the states of which have the form\nZ\nh\u03c8\u00b1 | = d3 p \u03c8(p)\u2217 hp\u00b1 | .\nNow, define an inner product on the functions \u03c8(p) such that\nZ 3\nd p\n(\u03c81 , \u03c82 ) \u2261 h\u03c81\u00b1 |t, \u03c82\u00b1 ; \u03bb0 i =\n\u03c81 (p)\u2217 \u03c82 (p) ,\n2\u03c9p\n\n(38)\n\nwhere the second equality follows from Eq. (35). Equipped with this inner product, each\nHt is itself a Hilbert space of the wave functions \u03c8(p). Note that it is the states of the dual\n\u2032\nspaces H\u00b1\nthat naturally satisfy the on-shell constraint h\u03c8\u00b1 |\u0124 = 0 (as suggested by, for\n\nexample, [44]).\nThe operators (2\u03c9p)|t0 , p\u00b1 ; \u03bb0 ihp\u00b1 | are self-adjoint under the inner product given in\nEq. (38), in the sense that the conjugate of\n(2\u03c9p)h\u03c8\u00b1 |t0 , p\u00b1 ; \u03bb0 ihp\u00b1 | = \u03c8(p)\u2217 hp\u00b1 |\n\n16\n\n\fis\n(2\u03c9p)|t0 , p\u00b1 ; \u03bb0 ihp\u00b1 |t, \u03c8\u00b1 ; \u03bb0 i = |t0 , p\u00b1 ; \u03bb0 i\u03c8(p)\nfor that inner product. Further,\nZ\nZ 3\nd p\n3\nd p (2\u03c9p)h\u03c81\u00b1 |t0 , p\u00b1 ; \u03bb0 ihp\u00b1 |t, \u03c82\u00b1 ; \u03bb0 i =\n\u03c81 (p)\u2217 \u03c82 (p) = h\u03c81\u00b1 |t, \u03c82\u00b1 ; \u03bb0 i ,\n2\u03c9p\nwhich gives the effective resolution of the identity\nZ\nd3 p (2\u03c9p)|t0 , p\u00b1 ; \u03bb0 ihp\u00b1 | = 1 .\n\n(39)\n\nIn fact, such a resolution of the identity generally holds for families of conjugate bra and\nket states with a bi-orthonormality relationship such as Eq. (35) (see [45] and App. A.8.1 of\n[46]). We can, therefore, take the operator (2\u03c9p)|t0 , p\u00b1 ; \u03bb0 ihp\u00b1 | to represent the quantum\nproposition that an on-shell particle or antiparticle has the 3-momentum p. Then, with the\nnormalization\n(\u03c8, \u03c8) =\n\nZ\n\nd3 p\n|\u03c8(p)|2 = 1 ,\n2\u03c9p\n\n|\u03c8(p)|2 is the corresponding probability density in 3-momentum space.\nFinally, consider that |t, x; \u03bb0 i is an eigenstate of the 3-position operator X\u0302, representing\na particle localized at the 3-position x at time t. From Eq. (37), and using the inverse\nFourier transform of Eq. (28) with Eq. (33), its 3-momentum wave function in Ht is\n(2\u03c9p)hp\u00b1 |t, x; \u03bb0i = (2\u03c0)\u22123/2 ei(\u00b1\u03c9p t\u2212p*x) .\n\n(40)\n\nThis is just a plane wave, and it is an eigenfunction of the operator\ne\u00b1i\u03c9p t i\n\n\u2202 \u2213i\u03c9p t\ne\n,\n\u2202p\n\nwhich is the traditional momentum representation i\u2202/\u2202p of the 3-position operator X\u0302,\ntranslated to time t.\nThis result contrasts with the well-known result of Newton and Wigner [47], who conclude that a localized particle wave function satisfying the Klein-Gordon equation is an\neigenfunction of\ni\n\n\u0012\n\np\n\u2202\n\u2212 2\n\u2202p 2\u03c9p\n\n\u0013\n\n,\n\nwhich has an extra term over the expected i\u2202/\u2202p. The key reason for this difference is our\nuse of the 3-momentum basis |t, p\u00b1 ; \u03bb0 i. With the dual basis (2\u03c9p)hp\u00b1 | from Eq. (35), this\nleads to the relation given in Eq. (37) and used in Eq. (40).\n17\n\n\fIn contrast, the traditional formalism assumes that both bra and ket states are on-shell.\nInstead of the time-dependent spaces Ht , the spaces H\u00b1 are used, with on-shell ket basis\nstates |p\u00b1 i that are dual to the bra states hp\u00b1 | under an inner product such that, instead\nof Eq. (35), one has\n(2\u03c9p\u2032 )1/2 hp\u2032\u00b1 |p\u00b1 i(2\u03c9p)1/2 = \u03b4 3 (p\u2032 \u2212 p) ,\nwhere the factor of (2\u03c9p)1/2 is introduced symmetrically on dual bra and ket states in order\nprovide an orthonormal basis. If we were to use the traditional dual basis (2\u03c9p)1/2 hp\u00b1 |,\ninstead of (2\u03c9p)hp\u00b1 |, the wave function of |t, x; \u03bb0 i would be\n(2\u03c9p)1/2 hp\u00b1 |t, x; \u03bb0 i = (2\u03c0)\u22123/2 (2\u03c9p)\u22121/2 ei(\u00b1\u03c9p t\u2212p*x) .\n\n(41)\n\nAt t = 0 this is exactly the Newton-Wigner wave function for a localized particle [47].\nNote that Eq. (40) is effectively related to Eq. (41) by a scalar Foldy-Wouthuysen transformation [48, 49]. This makes sense, since the Foldy-Wouthuysen transformation produces\na representation that separates positive and negative energy states (particles and antiparticles) and gives a reasonable non-relativistic limit.\nIndeed, from Eq. (27) we can easily see that the time evolution of the 3-momentum states\n|t, p\u00b1 ; \u03bb0 i is given by\neiP\u0302\n\n0 \u2206t\n\n|t, p\u00b1 ; \u03bb0 i = e\u00b1i\u03c9p \u2206t |t + \u2206t, p\u00b1 ; \u03bb0 i = e\u00b1i\u0124F W \u2206t |t + \u2206t, p\u00b1 ; \u03bb0 i ,\n\nwhere\n\u0124F W = (P\u0302 * P\u0302 + m2 )1/2\nis the scalar Foldy-Wouthuysen Hamiltonian and the P\u0302 \u03bc are the generators of spacetime\ntranslations. Define the operation of time translation on the time-dependent states |t, \u03c8; \u03bb0 i\nso that\n|t + \u2206t, \u03c8\u00b1 ; \u03bb0 i = eiP\u0302\n\n0 \u2206t\n\n|t, \u03c8\u00b1 ; \u03bb0 i .\n\nSubstituting Eq. (36) then gives\n|t + \u2206t, \u03c8\u00b1 ; \u03bb0 i =\n=\n=\n\nZ\n\nZ\n\nZ\n\nd3 p \u03c8(t, p)eiP\u0302\n\n0 \u2206t\n\n|t, p\u00b1 ; \u03bb0 i\n\nd3 p \u03c8(t, p)e\u00b1i\u03c9p \u2206t |t + \u2206t, p\u00b1 ; \u03bb0 i\nd3 p \u03c8(t + \u2206t, p)|t + \u2206t, p\u00b1 ; \u03bb0 i ,\n18\n\n\fwhere the time-dependence of the 3-momentum wave function has been made explicit, with\ntime evolution given by\n\u03c8(t + \u2206t, p) = e\u00b1i\u03c9p \u2206t \u03c8(t, p) .\nIn the non-relativistic limit, for positive-energy particles, \u03c9p \u2248 m + p2 /2m, and this time\nevolution reduces to time evolution according to the usual non-relativistic Hamiltonian (up\nto the momentum-independent phase factor exp(im\u2206t)).\n\nE.\n\nFree Multiparticle States\n\nThe formalism introduced in the previous sections can be extended in a straightforward\nway to a Fock space of non-interacting multiparticle states. In order to allow for multiparticle\nstates with different types of particles, extend the position state of each individual particle\nwith a particle type index n, such that\n\u2032\n\nhx\u2032 , n\u2032 ; \u03bb|x, n; \u03bbi = \u03b4nn \u03b4 4 (x\u2032 \u2212 x) .\nThen, construct a basis for the Fock space of multiparticle states as symmetrized products\nof N single particle states:\n|x1 , n1 , \u03bb1 ; . . . ; xN , nN , \u03bbN i \u2261 (N!)\u22121/2\n\nX\n\n|xP1 , nP1 ; \u03bbP1 i * * * |xPN , nPN ; \u03bbPN i ,\n\n(42)\n\nperms P\n\nwhere the sum is over all permutations P of 1, 2, . . . , N. (Since only scalar particles are\nbeing considered in the present work, only Bose-Einstein statistics need be accounted for.)\nDefine multiparticle states |x1 , n1 ; . . . ; xN , nN i as similarly symmetrized products of |xi\nstates. Then,\nhx\u20321 , n\u20321 ; . . . ; x\u2032N , n\u2032N |x1 , n1 , \u03bb0 ; . . . ; xN , nN , \u03bb0 i\n\n=\n\nN\nX Y\n\nn\u2032\n\n\u03b4niPi \u2206(x\u2032Pi \u2212 xi ; m2i ) ,\n\n(43)\n\nperms P i=1\n\nwhere mi is the mass of particles of type ni . Note that the use of the same parameter value \u03bb0\nfor the starting point of each particle path is simply a matter of convenience, using the path\nparameterization guage freedom to choose this value arbitrarily. The intrinsic lengths of each\nparticle path are still integrated over separately in |x1 , n1 ; . . . ; xN , nN i, which is important\nfor obtaining the proper particle propagator factors in Eq. (43). Nevertheless, by using \u03bb0\n\n19\n\n\fas a common starting parameter value, we can make the small notational simplification of\nnot repeating it multiple times in |x1 , n1 , \u03bb0 ; . . . ; xN , nN , \u03bb0 i, defining, instead,\n|x1 , n1 ; . . . ; xN , nN ; \u03bb0 i \u2261 |x1 , n1 , \u03bb0 ; . . . ; xN , nN , \u03bb0 i .\nFollowing the same procedures as in Sec. II C for each particle in a multiparticle state, it is straightforward to construct the multiparticle three momentum states\n|t1 , p1\u00b1 , n1 ; . . . ; tN , pN \u00b1 , nN i and |t1 , p1\u00b1 , n1 ; . . . ; tN , pN \u00b1 , nN ; \u03bb0 i. Note that each particle\nmay be either a normal particle (+) or an antiparticle (\u2212). Then, to obtain on-shell states\nwe need to take ti \u2192 +\u221e in |t1 , p1\u00b1 , n1 ; . . . ; tN , pN \u00b1 , nN i for particles, but ti \u2192 \u2212\u221e for\nantiparticles. This results in the multiparticle on-shell states |p1\u00b1 , n1 ; . . . ; pN \u00b1 , nN i.\nNow, it can be seen that the |p1\u00b1 , n1 ; . . . ; pN \u00b1 , nN i states may not always be particularly\nconvenient, since they describe normal particles at t = +\u221e and antiparticles at t = \u2212\u221e. For\ndescribing the asymptotic state of outgoing particles from a scattering process, for instance,\nwe would like to take the limit for all particles and antiparticles together as t \u2192 +\u221e.\nTo do this, we can take the viewpoint of considering antiparticles to be positive energy\nparticles traveling forwards in time, rather than negative energy particles traveling backwards in time. Since both particles and their antiparticles will then have positive energy,\nit becomes necessary to explicitly label antiparticles with separate (though related) types\nfrom their corresponding particles. Let n+ denote the type label for a normal particle type\nand n\u2212 denote the corresponding antiparticle type.\nFor normal particles of type n+ , position states are defined as in Eq. (24):\nhx, n+ |x0 , n+ ; \u03bb0 i = \u03b8(x0 \u2212 x00 )\u2206+ (x \u2212 x0 ) .\nFor antiparticles of type n\u2212 , however, position states are now defined such that\nhx, n\u2212 |x0 , n\u2212 ; \u03bb0 i = \u03b8(x0 \u2212 x00 )\u2206\u2212 (x0 \u2212 x) .\n\n(44)\n\nNote the reversal with respect to Eq. (24) of x0 and x on the righthand side of this equation.\nUsing Eq. (23), the Fourier transform of Eq.

Specifically, define the creation field \u03c8\u0302 \u2020 (x, n; \u03bb) by\n\u03c8\u0302 \u2020 (x, n; \u03bb)|x1 , n1 , \u03bb1 ; . . . ; xN , nN , \u03bbN i = |x, n, \u03bb; x1 , n1 , \u03bb1 ; . . . ; xN , nN , \u03bbN i ,\n21\n\n\fwith the corresponding annihilation field \u03c8\u0302(x, n; \u03bb) having the commutation relation\n\u2032\n\n[\u03c8\u0302(x\u2032 , n\u2032 ; \u03bb), \u03c8\u0302 \u2020(x, n; \u03bb0 )] = \u03b4nn \u2206(x\u2032 \u2212 x; \u03bb \u2212 \u03bb0 ) .\nFurther define\n\u03c8\u0302(x, n) \u2261\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\nd\u03bb \u03c8\u0302(x, n; \u03bb) ,\n\n(45)\n\n\u03bb0\n\nso that\n\n\u2032\n\n[\u03c8\u0302(x\u2032 , n\u2032 ), \u03c8\u0302 \u2020 (x, n; \u03bb0 )] = \u03b4nn \u2206(x\u2032 \u2212 x) ,\n\n(46)\n\nwhich is consistent with the multi-particle inner product as given in Eq. (43).\nNote the asymmetry in Eq. (46): \u03c8\u0302 \u2020 (x, n; \u03bb0 ) is at the reference value \u03bb0 of the path\nparameter (at the start of the path), while in \u03c8\u0302(x\u2032 , n\u2032 ) the path parameter (at the end of\nthe path) is integrated over. This results from the fact that it is the integrated position bra\nstate hx\u2032 , n\u2032 |, created by \u03c8\u0302(x\u2032 , n\u2032 ), that generates complete particle transition amplitudes (as\ndiscussed at the end of Sec. II A). It is thus convenient to consider hx, n| to be \"dual\" to\n|x, n; \u03bb0 i, in a similar fashion to the states hp\u00b1 | and |t, p\u00b1 ; \u03bb0 i in Sec. II C, even though, by\nEq. (21), the position states are not orthogonal.\nIn the field operator notation, this duality can be captured by introducing a special adjoint\n\u03c8\u0302 \u2021 defined by\n\u03c8\u0302 \u2021 (x, n) = \u03c8\u0302 \u2020 (x, n; \u03bb0 ) and \u03c8\u0302 \u2021 (x, n; \u03bb0 ) = \u03c8\u0302 \u2020 (x, n) .\n\n(47)\n\nThe commutation relation in Eq. (46) then takes on the more symmetric form\n\u2032\n\n[\u03c8\u0302(x\u2032 , n\u2032 ), \u03c8\u0302 \u2021 (x, n)] = \u03b4nn \u2206(x\u2032 \u2212 x) .\nWe can also define field operators for explicit particle and antiparticle types, as considered\nin Sec.

The very conception of interacting particles and their paths then only arises at all as a result of the\nperturbative expansion of the Hamiltonian. Such an approach is thus not very natural for\na foundational formalism based on spacetime paths.\nNow, the actual traditional motivation for introducing fields in the first place is largely\na heuristic response to the well known difficulties with negative energies and probabilities\nin relativistic quantum mechanics. However, as we have seen in Sec. II, these difficulties\n23\n\n\fcan also be handled in the context of the spacetime path formalism. Further, the spacetime\npath approach can very directly accommodate the creation and destruction of particles, as\nrequired in a relativistic theory. One simply considers particle paths with a finite length: a\nparticle is created at the start of its path and destroyed at the end.\nTaking this path viewpoint, an interaction vertex can then simply be considered as an\nevent at which a set of particle paths all end together and another set of particle paths all\nbegin. An interaction graph is a set of interaction vertices connected by particle paths. For\na collection of interacting particles, it is essentially such graphs that act as the fundamental\nbuilding blocks of the system state, rather than the individual particle paths themselves.\nThe natural spacetime path approach for interactions is therefore first quantized rather\nthan second quantized. As we will see in this section, the first-quantized spacetime path\nformalism can duplicate the basic results of perturbative quantum field theory for Feynman\ndiagrams and scattering. It is also consistent with the typically first-quantized geometric\napproach used in string theory [50].\nOf course, taking a first-quantized formalism as foundational requires that issues of consistency and convergence that appear in traditional perturbation theory be addressed directly,\nwithout recourse to a posited non-perturbative solution. We will return to this point at the\nend of Sec. III D, though a full discussion is beyond the scope of the present paper.\n\nA.\n\nInteractions\n\nSince incoming particles are destroyed at an interaction vertex, and outgoing particles\nare created, the vertex can be represented by an operator constructed as an appropriate\nproduct of the creation and annihilation operator fields introduced in Sec. II F. Note that\n\"incoming\" and \"outgoing\" are used here in the sense of the path evolution parameter \u03bb,\nnot time. That is, we are not separately considering particles and antiparticles at this point.\nPostulate 6. An interaction vertex, possibly occurring at any position in spacetime, with\nsome number a of incoming particles and some number b of outgoing particles, is represented\nby the operator\n\u2212 iV\u0302 \u2261 h\n\nZ\n\n4\n\ndx\n\na\nY\n\n\u03c8\u0302\n\ni=1\n\n24\n\n\u2021\n\n(x, n\u2032i )\n\nb\nY\nj=1\n\n\u03c8\u0302(x, nj ) ,\n\n(51)\n\n\fwhere the coefficient h represents the relative probability amplitude of the interaction and \u03c8\u0302 \u2021\nis the special adjoint defined in Eq. (47).\nThe probability amplitude for a transition from an initial state |x1 , n1 ; . . . ; xN , nN ; \u03bb0 i to\na final state |x\u20321 , n\u20321 ; . . . ; x\u2032N \u2032 , n\u2032N \u2032 i, with a single intermediate interaction, is then\nG1 (x\u20321 , n\u20321 ; . . . ; x\u2032N \u2032 , n\u2032N \u2032 |x1 , n1 ; . . . ; xN , nN )\n= hx\u20321 , n\u20321 ; . . . ; x\u2032N \u2032 , n\u2032N \u2032 |(\u2212i)V\u0302 |x1 , n1 ; . . . ; xN , nN ; \u03bb0 i .\nThis is essentially the amplitude for a first-order Wick diagram [51]. That is, it is equivalent\nto the first-order terms in the Wick expansion of the Dyson series in conventional quantum\nfield theory (including all permutations that may result from crossing symmetries if any of\nthe incoming or outgoing particles in the interaction are of the same type).\nThe probability amplitude corresponding to multiple intermediate interactions can then\nbe obtained by repeated applications of V\u0302 . Thus, the amplitude for m interactions is\nGm (x\u20321 , n\u20321 ; . . . ; x\u2032N \u2032 , n\u2032N \u2032 |x1 , n1 ; . . . ; xN , nN )\n= hx\u20321 , n\u20321 ; . . . ; x\u2032N \u2032 , n\u2032N \u2032 |\n\n(\u2212i)m m\nV\u0302 |x1 , n1 ; . . . ; xN , nN ; \u03bb0 i ,\nm!\n\nwhere the (m!)\u22121 factor accounts for all possible permutations of the m identical factors\nof V\u0302 . The complete interacting transition amplitude, with any number of intermediate\ninteractions, is then\nG(x\u20321 , n\u20321 ; . . . ; x\u2032N \u2032 , n\u2032N \u2032 |x1 , n1 ; . . . ; xN , nN )\n\n=\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nGm (x\u20321 , n\u20321 ; . . . ; x\u2032N , n\u2032N |x1 , n1 ; . . . ; xN , nN )\n\nm=0\n\n= hx\u20321 , n\u20321 ; . . . ; x\u2032N , n\u2032N |\u011c|x1 , n1 ; . . . ; xN , nN ; \u03bb0 i ,\n(52)\nwhere\n\n\u221e\nX\n(\u2212i)m m\n\u011c \u2261\nV\u0302 = e\u2212iV\u0302 .\nm!\nm=0\n\n(53)\n\nExtend the operation of the special adjoint in the natural way to sums and products. Then it\nis clear, at least formally, that \u011c is unitary relative to this adjoint (that is, \u011c\u2021 \u011c = \u011c\u011c\u2021 = 1),\nso long as V\u0302 is self-adjoint relative to it (that is, V\u0302 \u2021 = V\u0302 ).\nFrom Eq. (51), there are two consequences to V\u0302 being self-adjoint. First ih = g must\nbe real. Second, the interaction must involve the same number of incoming and outgoing\n25\n\n\fparticles, of the same types. This second consequence is a result of assuming so far that\nthere is only one possible type of interaction. The formalism can be easily extended to allow\nfor multiple types of interactions by adding additional terms to the definition of V\u0302 . In this\ncase, only the overall operator V\u0302 needs to be self-adjoint, not the individual interaction\nterms.\nFor example,\n\nconsider the case of a three-particle interaction of the form\n\n\u03c8\u0302 \u2021 (x, nA )\u03c8\u0302(x, nB )\u03c8\u0302(x, nA ). Then, for the overall interaction operator V\u0302 to be self-adjoint,\nthere must also be a conjugate interaction term \u03c8\u0302 \u2021 (x, nA )\u03c8\u0302 \u2021 (x, nB )\u03c8\u0302(x, nA ). That is,\nZ\nV\u0302 = g d4 x [\u03c8\u0302 \u2021 (x, nA )\u03c8\u0302(x, nB )\u03c8\u0302(x, nA ) + \u03c8\u0302 \u2021 (x, nA )\u03c8\u0302 \u2021 (x, nB )\u03c8\u0302(x, nA )] .\nThis corresponds to the case of the particle of type B being indistinguishable from its\nantiparticle. Defining the self-adjoint effective field\n\u03c8\u0302 \u2032 (x, nB ) \u2261 \u03c8\u0302(x, nB ) + \u03c8\u0302 \u2021 (x, nB )\nthen allows V\u0302 to be put back into the form of a single type of interaction:\nZ\nV\u0302 = g d4 x \u03c8\u0302 \u2021 (x, nA )\u03c8\u0302 \u2032 (x, nB )\u03c8\u0302(x, nA ) .\n\n(54)\n\nAn alternate interpretation of a self-adjoint interaction vertex is to pair up incoming and\noutgoing particles of the same type and consider them to be the same particle before and\nafter the interaction. For example, an interaction of the form given in Eq. (54) would be\nconsidered to represent a single particle of type A interacting with a self-adjoint particle of\ntype B.\nThis viewpoint can be seen more explicitly by considering a first-order interaction matrix\nelement and using Eq. (12) to expand the A-particle propagators:\nhxA , nA ; xB , nB |V\u0302 |x0 , nA ; \u03bb0 i\nZ\n= g d4 x \u2206A (xA \u2212 x)\u2206B (xB \u2212 x)\u2206A (x \u2212 x0 )\nZ \u221e\nZ\nZ \u221e\n4\nd\u03bb\u2032 \u2206A (xA \u2212 x; \u03bb\u2032 \u2212 \u03bb0 )\u2206A (x \u2212 x0 ; \u03bb \u2212 \u03bb0 )\nd\u03bb\n= g d x \u2206B (xB \u2212 x)\nZ\nZ\u03bb0\u221e\nZ\u03bb0\u221e\n= g d4 x \u2206B (xB \u2212 x)\nd\u03bb\nd\u03bb\u2032 \u2206A (xA \u2212 x; \u03bb\u2032 \u2212 \u03bb)\u2206A (x \u2212 x0 ; \u03bb \u2212 \u03bb0 ) .\n\u03bb0\n\n\u03bb\n\nSubstituting for the A-particle kernels from Eq. (6), the path integral for the first kernel\nends at the same point x as the path integral for the second kernel begins. Therefore, the\n26\n\n\ftwo path integrals can be combined into a single path integral, with the constraint that the\npaths always pass through the intermediate point x:\nhxA , nA ; xB , nB |V\u0302 |x0 , nA ; \u03bb0 i\nZ\nZ\n4\n= g d x \u2206B (xB \u2212 x)\n\n\u221e\n\nd\u03bb\n\n\u03bb0\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\u2032\n\nd\u03bb \u03b7\n\n\u03bb\n\nZ\n\nD4 q \u03b4 4 (q(\u03bb\u2032 ) \u2212 xA )\u03b4 4 (q(\u03bb) \u2212 x)\n\u03b4 4 (q(\u03bb0 ) \u2212 x0 )eiSA [q\u0307]\n\n=g\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\nd\u03bb\n\n\u2032\n\nZ\n\n\u03bb\u2032\n\nd\u03bb \u03b7\n\n\u03bb0\n\n\u03bb0\n\nZ\n\nD4 q \u03b4 4 (q(\u03bb\u2032 ) \u2212 xA )\u03b4 4 (q(\u03bb0 ) \u2212 x0 )eiSA [q\u0307] \u2206B (xB \u2212 q(\u03bb)) .\n\nThis form clearly reflects the viewpoint of a single A-particle interacting with a B-particle\nat the point q(\u03bb) in its path.\nNow consider a second-order interaction in which the incoming and outgoing particles\nare all A-particles:\n1\nhx\u20321 , nA ; x\u20322 , nA | V\u0302 2 |x1 , nA ; x2 , nA ; \u03bb0 i\n2Z\n2 Z\ng\nd4 y1\nd4 y2 [\u2206A (x\u20321 \u2212 y2 )\u2206A (y2 \u2212 y1 )\u2206A (y1 \u2212 x1 )\u2206B (y2 \u2212 y1 )\u2206A (x\u20322 \u2212 x2 )\n=\n2\n\n+ \u2206A (x\u20321 \u2212 y1 )\u2206A (y1 \u2212 x1 )\u2206B (y2 \u2212 y1 )\u2206A (x\u20322 \u2212 y2 )\u2206A (y2 \u2212 x2 ) + * * * ] , (55)\n\nwhere the additional terms not shown are the result of position interchanges from the terms\ngiven.

(52) to a Feynman diagram formulation. To do this, replace the initial and final states\nin Eq. (52) with on-shell multiparticle momentum states |t1 , p1\u00b1 , n1 ; . . . ; tN , pN \u00b1 , nN ; \u03bb0 i\nand |p\u20321 \u00b1 , n\u20321 ; . . . ; p\u2032N \u2032 \u00b1 , n\u2032N \u2032 ; \u03bb0 i (note that these are the on-shell multiparticle states defined\nin Sec. II E, with antiparticles propagating backwards in time, not the single-time states\ndefined at the end of that section):\nG(p\u20321 \u00b1 , n\u20321 ; . . . ; p\u2032N \u2032 \u00b1 , n\u2032N \u2032 |p1\u00b1 , n1 ; . . . ; pN \u00b1 , nN )\n#1/2\n\" N\u2032\nN\nY\nY\n2\u03c9pi\nhp\u20321 \u00b1 , n\u20321 ; . . . ; p\u2032N \u2032 \u00b1 , n\u2032N \u2032 |\u011c|t1 , p1\u00b1 , n1 ; . . . ; tN , pN \u00b1 , nN ; \u03bb0 i .

(57) requires specifically identifying external\nlines as particles and antiparticles. For each initial and final particle, + is chosen if it is a\nnormal particle and \u2212 if it is an antiparticle. The result is a sum of Feynman diagrams,\nincluding all possible permutations of interaction vertices and crossing symmetries. The\ninner products of the on-shell states for individual initial and final particles with the offshell states for interaction vertices give the proper factors for the external lines of a Feynman\ndiagram.\nFor a final particle, the on-shell state hp\u2032+ | is obtained in the limit t\u2032 \u2192 +\u221e. Such a\nparticle is thus an outgoing particle from the scattering process. If the external line for this\nparticle starts at an interaction vertex x, then the line contributes an appropriate factor\n(2\u03c9p\u2032 )1/2 hp\u2032+ |x; \u03bb0 i = (2\u03c0)\u22123/2 (2\u03c9p\u2032 )\u22121/2 ei(+\u03c9p\u2032 x\n\n0 \u2212p\u2032 *x)\n\n.\n\nFor a final antiparticle, however, the on-shell state hp\u2032\u2212 | is obtained in the limit t\u2032 \u2192 \u2212\u221e.\nThis means that the antiparticle is incoming to the scattering process, even though it derives\nfrom a final vertex, reflecting the time-reversal of antiparticle paths. If the external line for\nthis antiparticle starts at an interaction vertex x, then the line contributes the factor\n(2\u03c9p\u2032 )1/2 hp\u2032\u2212 |x; \u03bb0 i = (2\u03c0)\u22123/2 (2\u03c9p\u2032 )\u22121/2 ei(\u2212\u03c9p\u2032 x\n\n0 +p\u2032 *x)\n\n.\n\nNext, consider an initial particle on an external line ending at an interaction vertex x\u2032 ,\nThe factor for this line is (assuming x\u20320 > t)\n(2\u03c9p)1/2 hx\u2032 |t, p+ ; \u03bb0 i = (2\u03c0)\u22123/2 (2\u03c9p)\u22121/2 ei(\u2212\u03c9p x\n\n\u20320 +p*x\u2032 )\n\n.\n\nNote that this expression is independent of t, so we can take t \u2192 \u2212\u221e and treat the particle\nas incoming. For an initial antiparticle, the corresponding factor is (assuming x\u20320 < t)\n(2\u03c9p)1/2 hx\u2032 |t, p\u2212 ; \u03bb0 i = (2\u03c0)\u22123/2 (2\u03c9p)\u22121/2 ei(+\u03c9p x\n\n\u20320 \u2212p*x\u2032 )\n\n.\n\nTaking t \u2192 +\u221e, this represents the factor for an antiparticle that is outgoing.\nIf a particle or antiparticle both starts at an initial vertex x and ends at a final vertex\nx\u2032 , then, by Eq. (35),\n(2\u03c9p\u2032 2\u03c9p)1/2 hp\u2032\u00b1 |t, p\u00b1 ; \u03bb0 i = \u03b4 3 (p\u2032 \u2212 p) .\nFinally, particles that start and end on interaction vertices (i.e., internal edges) are \"virtual\"\nparticles propagating between interactions, retaining the full Feynman propagator factor\n\u2206(x\u2032 \u2212 x).\n29\n\n\fThus, the effect of Eq. (57) is to remove the propagator factors from the external lines\nof the summed Feynman diagrams, retaining them on internal edges. Since, in the position\nrepresentation, G is essentially a sum of Green's functions Gm , this procedure is effectively\nequivalent to the usual LSZ reduction of the Green's functions [42, 51, 54].\n\nC.\n\nScattering\n\nThe formulation of Eq. (57) is still not that of the usual scattering matrix, since the\ninitial state involves incoming particles but outgoing antiparticles, and vice versa for the\nfinal state. To construct the usual scattering matrix, it is necessary to have multiparticle\nstates that involve either all incoming particles and antiparticles (that is, they are composed\nof individual asymptotic particle states that are all consistently for t \u2192 \u2212\u221e) or all outgoing\nparticles and antiparticles (with individual asymptotic states all for t \u2192 +\u221e). These are the\nstates |p1 , n1\u00b1 ; . . . ; pN , nN \u00b1 ; \u03bb0 i and |p1 , n1\u00b1 ; . . . ; pN , nN \u00b1 i defined at the end of Sec. II E.\nReorganizing the scattering amplitude of Eq. (57) in terms of these asymptotic states gives\nthe more usual form using the scattering operator \u015c.

(59), giving the probability of a particular out\nstate for a particular in state.\nNext, use Eqs. (49) and (50) in Eq. (22) to write the propagator as\n\u2206(x \u2212 x0 ) = \u03b8(x0 \u2212 x00 )[\u03c8\u0302(x, n+ ), \u03c8\u0302 \u2021 (x0 , n+ )] + \u03b8(x00 \u2212 x0 )[\u03c8\u0302(x0 , n\u2212 ), \u03c8\u0302 \u2021 (x, n\u2212 )] .\n\n(61)\n\nThen, reversing the usual derivation for Feynman diagrams (see, for example, [42]) gives the\nDyson series expansion\n\u015c = 1 +\n\nZ\n\u221e\nX\n(\u2212i)n\nn=1\n\nn!\n\n\u221e\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\ndt1\n\nZ\n\nt1\n\ndt2 * * *\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nZ\n\ntn\u22121\n\ndtn V\u0302 (t1 )V\u0302 (t2 ) * * * V\u0302 (tn )\n\n(62)\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nin terms of the time-dependent interaction operator\nZ\na\nb\nY\nY\nV\u0302 (t) \u2261 g d3 x\n\u03a8\u0302\u2021 (t, x, n\u2032i )\n\u03a8\u0302(t, x, nj ) ,\ni=1\n\nj=1\n\nwhere\n\u03a8\u0302(x, n) \u2261 \u03c8\u0302(x, n+ ) + \u03c8\u0302 \u2021 (x, n\u2212 ) .\n\n(63)\n\nSince V\u0302 (t) represents an interaction with the same number of incoming and outgoing\nparticles, of the same types, as V\u0302 , the self-adjointness of V\u0302 implies the self-adjointness of\nV\u0302 (t), from which it can be shown that \u015c is unitary. The case of a self-adjoint effective field\n\u03c8\u0302 \u2032 (x, n) in V\u0302 (as discussed at the end of Sec. III A) corresponds to the requirement of selfadjointness for \u03a8\u0302(x, n). As can be seen from Eq. (63), this requirement implies that particles\nof type n are indistinguishable from their (path-reversed) antiparticles (indeed, a working\ndefinition of \"indistinguishable\" in this sense might very well be \"cannot be distinguished\nby any interaction\").\n\nD.\n\nRegularization and Renormalization\n\nOf course, the development given in the previous subsections is actually only formal,\nbecause of the usual problems with divergence of the series in Eq. (52). As in conventional\nfield theory, it is necessary to regularize infinite integrals and renormalize the resulting\namplitudes. For a first-quantized approach, though, these problems seem particularly severe,\nsince Eq. (52) is taken as the fundamental definition for the interacting amplitude, rather\nthan as a perturbation expansion.\n31\n\n\fFortunately, there is a relatively straightforward way to approach regularization within\nthe context of a spacetime path approach, inspired by the work of Frastai and Horwitz [37]\n(see also [55, 56] for a similar approach in the context of off-shell electrodynamics). This\nis to make the interaction coupling dependent on the intrinsic path length. This can be\nnaturally introduced into the spacetime path formalism by making a choice for the weight\nfunction f (T ) introduced in Sec. II A different than f (T ) = 1.\nTo see this, consider that replacing the field operator \u03c8\u0302(x, n) defined in Eq. (45) with\nZ \u221e\n\u03c8\u0302f (x, n) \u2261\nd\u03bb f (\u03bb \u2212 \u03bb0 )\u03c8\u0302(x, n; \u03bb)\n\u03bb0\n\ngives the commutation relation\n\u2032\n\n\u2020\n\n[\u03c8\u0302f (x , n), \u03c8\u0302 (x, n; \u03bb0 )] =\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\ndT f (T )\u2206(x\u2032 \u2212 x; T ) ,\n0\n\nresulting in a propagator including the weight factor f (T ). Using this new field operator\nfor, say, particles of type nA in the interaction vertex operator given in Eq. (54) produces\nthe desired path-length-dependent coupling:\nZ\nZ \u221e\n4\nV\u0302 = g d x\nd\u03bb f (\u03bb \u2212 \u03bb0 )\u03c8\u0302 \u2020 (x, nA ; \u03bb0 )\u03c8\u0302(x, nA ; \u03bb)\u03c8\u0302 \u2032 (x, nB ) .\n\n(64)\n\n\u03bb0\n\nFor the purposes of the present section, an appropriate choice for f (\u03bb \u2212 \u03bb0 ) is the Gaussian\n2 /2\u2206\u03bb2\n\nf (\u03bb \u2212 \u03bb0 ) = e\u2212(\u03bb\u2212\u03bb0 )\n\n,\n\nwhere \u2206\u03bb is a correlation length. For \u2206\u03bb \u2192 \u221e, f (\u03bb \u2212 \u03bb0 ) \u2192 1, and Eq. (64) reduces to\nEq. (54).\nNow, consider again the self-interaction term from Eq. (55). Using the interaction vertex\noperator from Eq. (64), this becomes\nZ \u221e\nZ \u221e\nZ\n4 \u2032\nd\u03bb2 f (\u03bb2 \u2212 \u03bb0 )\u2206A (p\u2032 ; \u03bb2 \u2212 \u03bb0 )f (\u03bb1 \u2212 \u03bb0 )\u2206B (p \u2212 p\u2032 )\u2206A (p; \u03bb1 \u2212 \u03bb0 )\nd\u03bb1\n\u2206A (p) d p\n\u03bb0\n\n\u03bb0\n\nFor simplicity, the momentum representation has been used here, in which\n\u2206A (p; \u03bb \u2212 \u03bb0 ) \u2261 e\u2212i(\u03bb\u2212\u03bb0 )(p\nand\n\u2206A (p) \u2261\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n2 +m2 )\nA\n\n\u221e\n\ndT \u2206A (p; T ) = \u2212i(p2 + m2A \u2212 i\u03b5)\n32\n\n\f(and similarly for \u2206B ). The propagator from \u03bb0 to \u03bb1 is not divergent, so we can let\nf (\u03bb1 \u2212 \u03bb0 ) \u2192 1, giving \u2206A (p)T \u2032(p)\u2206A (p), where\nZ \u221e\nZ\n\u2032\n4 \u2032\nd\u03bb f (\u03bb \u2212 \u03bb0 )\u2206A (p\u2032 ; \u03bb \u2212 \u03bb0 )\u2206B (p \u2212 p\u2032 ) .\nT (p) \u2261 d p\n\n(65)\n\n\u03bb0\n\nInserting Eq.

However, Eq. (66) is exactly the PauliVillars regularization prescription in continuous form [57]. Adjust the Fourier transform of\nthe coefficients F (m2 ) so that\n\nF\u0303 (\u03bb) =\n\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2f (\u03bb)e\u2212i\u03bbm2A , if \u03bb > \u03b4;\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f30,\n\nif \u03bb \u2264 \u03b4.\n\nThis then meets the Pauli-Villars conditions in Fourier space for cancelation of singularities\n[10]: F\u0303 (0) = 0 and F\u0303 \u2032 (0) = 0. For \u2206\u03bb \u2192 \u221e and \u03b4 \u2192 0, T \u2032 (p) reduces to the unregulated quantity T (p; m2A ). (For further discussion, see [37]. In [55, 56], a similar result is\nobtained for a photon mass spectrum cut-off for the renormalization of off-shell quantum\nelectrodynamics.)\nOnce the divergent integrals have been regulated, one can apply the usual techniques of\nmultiplicative renormalization in the context of the Feynman diagram formalism obtained in\nSec. III B. However, further discussion of renormalization is beyond the scope of the present\npaper. An intriguing direction for future exploration is the development of a complete\nregularization and renormalization program based on a physically motivated formulation\nof spacetime interactions. This would be consistent with the first-quantized approach of\n33\n\n\fconsidering the series expansion to be the primary representation of the physical situation\nof the scattering amplitude, rather than a perturbative approximation to a non-perturbative\nLagrangian formulation.\nA potentially more serious issue is whether, even after renormalization, series such as\nthat in Eq. (52) converge at all. However, Dyson's classic argument against convergence [58]\nis based on the conception of traditional quantum electrodynamics, where such series result\nfrom perturbation expansion. In the present first-quantized formalism, Dyson's argument\nmight simply imply that the traditional formalism, and arguments from it, are not always\napplicable.\nActually, it is not the convergence of series for probability amplitudes, such as Eq. (52),\nthat is really important. Rather, the real issue is whether there is a well-defined limit as\nN \u2192 \u221e for physically testable probabilities such as given by\n|h\u03b1out |\u015c (N ) |\u03c8in i|2\nh\u03c8in |\u015c (N )\u2021 \u015c (N ) |\u03c8in i\n\n,\n\nwhere \u015c (N ) is the result of summing Eq. (62) to Nth order, |\u03c8in i is a properly normalized\nmultiparticle in state and |\u03b1out i is a member of a complete basis for multiparticle out states.\nQuantities such as this for, say, QED produce values that agree with experiment for large\nN. If it turns out that they do diverge for very large N, this just means that there is some\nmechanism in the real universe that suppresses the interference effect of interaction graphs\nwith very large N, producing a finite cutoff of the series in Eq. (62).\nIndeed, from this perspective, the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formulations could be\nviewed as the approximations, obtained by assuming the summing of series for N \u2192 \u221e. In\nthe end, the problem of divergences might even be seen as an artifact of the conventional\nsecond-quantized Lagrangian formulation itself, rather than of its perturbation expansion.\nClearly this is an area that bears continued exploration.\n\nIV.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nSpacetime approaches to relativistic quantum mechanics have been developed along a\nnumber of different threads in the literature, from the early work on proper time formalisms\nby Schwinger and others [8, 9, 10], to the equally early work of Stueckelberg [6, 7] and\nthe parametrized relativistic quantum theory it inspired [12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 18, 36], to the\n34\n\n\fpath integral approach introduced by Feynman [4, 11, 17, 52] and its application to quantum\ngravity [19, 21, 25], to the worldline formalism obtained as the infinite-tension limit of string\ntheory [26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32] and its relation to the typically first-quantized approach\nto interaction taken in string theory [50]. The formalism presented in the previous sections\ncan be seen as a foundation underlying all these approaches.\nA particularly significant additional result is the derivation of on-shell particles and antiparticle states as the infinite time limit of free particle states. This provides a connection\nbetween off-shell parametrized spacetime quantum theories [37, 41, 53, 59, 60] and traditional on-shell quantum field theory. It also suggests the intiguing possibility that, while real\nparticles are likely on-shell to a very high degree of approximation, there may be testable\nconsequences to this approximation not being exact.\nThe foundation presented here provides a number of interesting avenues for exploration\nin future publications.\nThe approach can be readily extended to incorporate path integral representations for\nnon-scalar particles [61, 62, 63, 64, 65]. It can also handle massless particles, though it\nis not so straightforward to deal properly with the resulting gauge symmetries [59] and\nnon-Abelian interactions.\nFurther, an important payoff of the spacetime path formalism is the intuitive grounding it\ngives to the theory, as opposed to the somewhat arbitrary mathematical justifications for introducing fields in traditional quantum field theory. Moreover, the formalism for interacting\nspacetime paths provides interesting possibilities for addressing the issues of regularization\nand renormalization (which is all the more important because of the first-quantized nature\nof the formalism).\nFinally, a natural interpretational framework for the formalism is the consistent histories\napproach to quantum theory [66, 67, 68, 69, 70]. Particle paths can be treated as finegrained histories in the sense of this approach, with coarse-grained histories corresponding\nto the superposition of fine-grained states, including cosmological histories of the universe\nas a whole [19, 71, 72, 73].\nFor example, scattering probabilities can be considered to represent the probabilities of\ndecohering alternative coarse-grained spacetime histories for the scattering process. Probabilities can even be given to decohering cosmological histories of the universe [74]. Such\nan interpretation also provides for a natural way to see how the macroscopic classical view\n35\n\n\fof the universe emerges from the more detailed quantum description, rather than viewing\nquantum physics as a \"quantization\" of a classical description (see, for example, [75]), just\nas one would wish from a foundational quantum theory.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nI would like to thank George Baker for his encouragement on an early version of this work\nand express my great appreciation to Philip Johnson and Lawrence Horwitz for extensive\ncomments and discussion on subsequent versions.\n\nAPPENDIX A: FORM OF THE PHASE FUNCTIONAL\n\nProposition. The phase functional S must have the form\nZ \u03bb1\nd\u03bb\u2032 L[q\u0307; \u03bb\u2032 ] ,\nS[q\u0307] =\n\n(A1)\n\n\u03bb0\n\nwhere the parametrization domain for q\u0307 is [\u03bb0 , \u03bb1 ] and L[q\u0307; \u03bb] depends only on q\u0307 and its\nhigher derivatives evaluated at \u03bb.\nProof. In\nS[q\u0307; \u03bb\u2032 , \u03bb0 ] = S[q\u0307; \u03bb\u2032 , \u03bb] + S[q\u0307; \u03bb, \u03bb0] ,\nconsider \u03bb\u2032 = \u03bb + \u03b4\u03bb, for infinitesimal \u03b4\u03bb:\nS[q\u0307; \u03bb + \u03b4\u03bb, \u03bb0 ] = S[q\u0307; \u03bb + \u03b4\u03bb, \u03bb] + S[q\u0307; \u03bb, \u03bb0]\n\u2248 \u03b4\u03bb\nor\n\n\u2202S[q\u0307; \u03bb\u2032 , \u03bb]\n\u2202\u03bb\u2032\n\n+ S[q\u0307; \u03bb, \u03bb0] ,\n\u03bb\u2032 =\u03bb\n\n\u2202S[q\u0307; \u03bb\u2032 , \u03bb]\nS[q\u0307; \u03bb + \u03b4\u03bb, \u03bb0 ] \u2212 S[q\u0307; \u03bb, \u03bb0 ]\n\u2248\n\u03b4\u03bb\n\u2202\u03bb\u2032\n\n.\n\u03bb\u2032 =\u03bb\n\nTaking the limit \u03b4\u03bb \u2192 0 then gives\n\u2202S[q\u0307; \u03bb, \u03bb0]\n= L[q\u0307; \u03bb] ,\n\u2202\u03bb\nwhere\nL[q\u0307; \u03bb] \u2261\n\n\u2202S[q\u0307; \u03bb\u2032 , \u03bb]\n\u2202\u03bb\u2032\n\n36\n\n(A2)\n\n.\n\u03bb\u2032 =\u03bb\n\n\fNow, the functional L depends only on q\u0307 and \u03bb, not \u03bb0 . Therefore, integrate Eq. (A2) over\n\u03bb, with the initial condition S[q\u0307; \u03bb0 , \u03bb0 ] = 0, to get\nZ \u03bb\nd\u03bb\u2032 L[q\u0307; \u03bb\u2032 ] ,\nS[q\u0307; \u03bb, \u03bb0 ] =\n\u03bb0\n\nwhich is just Eq. (A1).\nFurther, by definition S[q\u0307; \u03bb, \u03bb0] only depends on values of q\u0307 \u03bc between \u03bb0 and \u03bb. Therefore,\nS[q\u0307; \u03bb + \u03b4\u03bb, \u03bb] \u2248 L[q\u0307; \u03bb]\u03b4\u03bb should only depend on q\u0307 infinitesimally close to \u03bb. As \u03b4\u03bb \u2192 0,\nthis effectively limits L[q\u0307; \u03bb] to depend only on q\u0307 and its derivatives evaluated at \u03bb.\n\nAPPENDIX B: EVALUATION OF THE PATH INTEGRAL\n\nProposition.
