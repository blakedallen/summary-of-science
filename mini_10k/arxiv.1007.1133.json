We demonstrate\nalso, that there is no relation between the spin current in the bulk, which is zero in the considered\ncase, and the edge spin accumulation.\nPACS numbers: 72.25.-b, 73.23.-b, 73.50.Bk\n\nCurrently there is a great interest, both experimental\nand theoretical, to spin currents and spin accumulation\nin various mesoscopic semiconductor structures [1, 2].\nBoth phenomena are due to spin-orbit coupling and are\nof great importance for future spin electronics. The edge\nspin density accumulation related to the Mott asymmetry in scattering off impurities was recently measured [3].\nMoreover, the edge spin density in the 2D hole system\nwhich is due to the so-called intrinsic mechanism of the\nspin-orbit interaction was also observed [4]. One of the\nquestion of the interest is the relation between the spin\ncurrent in the bulk and the spin density accumulated near\nthe sample boundary. It is well known that in the diffusive regime (when a spin diffusion length is much larger\nthan a mean free path), such a relation indeed exists [2],\nand the spin density appearing near the boundary is entirely determined by the spin flux coming from the bulk.\nFor example, in the diffusive regime and in the case of\nRashba Hamiltonian, when the spin current in the bulk\nis zero, the spin density component perpendicular to the\nplane is zero everywhere down to the sample boundary\n[5].\nHowever, in an opposite case, when the spin precession length is much shorter than the mean free path, the\nsituation is much less clear. An example of such a situation is a mesoscopic ballistic (or quasi-ballistic) structure\nwith spin-orbit-related splitting of the electron spectrum\ncharacterized by the energy \u2206R , when one has the limit\n\u2206R \u03c4p \u226b 1, where \u03c4p is the mean free time. Besides, in\nthe presence of spin-orbit interaction, the boundary scattering itself is the source of generation of the spin density.\nIt is quite clear that the characteristic length near bound-\n\nary where the spin density appears is the spin precession\nlength, Ls = h\u0304vF /\u2206R , with vF being the Fermi velocity. Thus in general there are two sources of the edge\nspin accumulation, the spin generation by the boundary\nscattering itself and the one due to the spin flux coming\nfrom the bulk (as it should be, at least, in the case of\n2D holes with a qubic s-o Hamiltonian). It is a separate problem to find the relative contributions of these\ntwo mechanisms to the edge spin accumulation. Now we\nstudy only the first mechanism when the spin density is\ngenerated upon the boundary scattering.\nFor that we consider a mesoscopic structure described\nby Rashba Hamiltonian in the ballistic limit when a mean\nfree path is much greater than the sample sizes. The ballistic region is attached to the leads, and a voltage V applied between the leads causes a charge current through\nthe structure, as shown in Fig. 1. We stress that the\nelectric field is absent inside an ideal ballistic conductor, therefore the edge spin polarization appears not as\na result of acceleration of electrons by an electric field\nand associated spin precession. Instead, the edge spin\naccumulation is due to the difference in populations of\nleft-moving and right-moving electrons. Combined effect\nof the boundary scattering and spin precession leads to\noscillations of the edge polarization. Thus, there is no relation between the spin current in the bulk, which is zero\nin the case considered, and the edge spin accumulation.\nWe solve the problem by using scattering theory, with\nscattering states coming from different leads of the structure and, therefore, having different occupations. The\nsimplicity of the method allows to gain an insight into\nthe underlaying physics.

Voltage\nV applied to the ideal leads causes a charge current through\nthe ballistic region.\n\nsity accumulation in the ballistic case and for the straight\nboundary was erlier considered in Ref. [6] with the help\nof the Green's functions method (see also Ref. [7]). Surprisingly, in this case all the long-wave oscillations of the\nspin density cancel, and the final result contains only the\nFriedel-like oscillations with the momentum 2kF . Unfortunately, the method used in Ref. [6] does not allow a\nsimple interpretation of the puzzling result.\nHere we show that it is the unitarity of scattering\nthat leads to exact cancellation of the long-wave oscillations of the spin density with the Ls period in case of\na straight boundary. It should be also mentioned that\nthe observed behaviour is closely related to the effective\none-dimensional character of the scattering problem arising from the translational invariance along the boundary.\nThis result may be interpreted as spin-orbit splitting of\nthe Friedel oscillations in the charge density. In other\nwords, two charge oscillations corresponding to spin-up\nand spin-down orientations, which coincided without s-o\ncoupling, get shifted with respect to each other in the\npresence of the s-o interaction. Thus, short-wave length\n\noscillations acquire in addition smooth envelope function\nwith the characteristic length Ls [6]. Therefore, strictly\nspeaking, this phenomenon is different from a spin-orbitrelated accumulation of the spin density upon boundary\nscattering.\nHowever, the case of a straight boundary appears to\nbe a rather exceptional case, while in general the smooth\nspin oscillations with the spin precession length Ls recover, as it happens, for example, for the wiggly boundary, or for scattering off a circular impurity in a 2D electron system [8]. This is a consequence of the fact that in\nhigher dimensions the conditions of the unitarity of scattering take a different form, as explained below. In all\nthese situations the spin density decays as a power law\nof the distance from the scatterer.\nThe straight boundary. The s-o Hamiltonian i\u030an the\nbulk of a ballistic 2D electron system takes the following\nform\n\u0124(p) =\n\np2\n\u03b1\np2\nM\n+ ~n[~\u03c3 \u00d7 p], \u01ebM (p) =\n+\n\u03b1p,\n2m\n2\n2m\n2\n\n(1)\n\nwhere ~n is the normal to the plane, p is the 2D momentum, and M = \u00b1 are the helicity values. The solutions of\nthis Hamiltonian have the form exp(ipr/h\u0304)\u03c7M (p), where\nr = x, y and the explicite form of the spinors is\n1\n\u03c7\u00b1 (\u03c6) = \u221a\n2\n\n\u0012\n\n1\n\u2213iei\u03c6\n\n\u0013\n\nwith \u03c6 being the angle between the momentum p and\nthe positive direction of the x-axis. Now we consider the\nsemi-infinite system and choose the x-axis to be directed\nperpendicular to the boundary (x = 0) of the 2D system,\nsee Fig. 1.

(7), we find that one\nmay distinguish various contributions to < Sz (x) > with\ndifferent oscillation periods, which originate from an interference of different terms in Eqs. (2) and (3). The\npart of < Sz (x) > which involves the interference of the\noutgoing waves (two last terms in Eqs.

Note, that the period of oscillations\nof the exponential factor ei(k\u2212k1 )x in Eq. (8) is of the\norder of the spin precession length. However, the term\n(8) vanishes, because the expression A is exactly equal\nto zero. Indeed, this expression is nothing but a nondiagonal component of the identity matrix \u015c \u015c \u2020 . Thus,\nwe obtain an interesting result that the only reason for\nthe absence of the long-wave oscillations in < Sz (x) > is\nthe unitarity of scattering.\nFinally, by taking into account in Eq. (7) the terms\nresponsible for the interference between incoming and\nthe outgoing waves (for example, between first and second terms in Eq. 2), and adding the contribution from\nthe evanescent modes [10], we reproduce Eq. (16) of\nthe Ref. [6].

Therefore, the total\nR \u221e spin per unit2 length along the boundary scales as\ndxSz (x) \u221d \u03b1 . Note, that the main contribution to\n0\nthis integral comes from small distances from the boundary, x \u2243 \u03bbF , which makes it to depend strongly on the\nboundary quality. In what follows we show that, indeed,\nbreaking the translation invariance along the boundary\ninduces long wave length oscillations of the spin density\nand leads to the total spin that is not small in the parameter \u03b1.\nScattering by the wiggly boundary. We consider here\nscattering off the wiggly boundary, shown in Fig. 2. Because in this case the translational invariance is broken,\nthe condition of the unitarity of scattering takes a different form as compared to the case of the straight boundary, and, as a result, the cancellation of the smooth\nspin density oscillations does not take place. In order\nto demonstrate this effect we consider the mathematically simple case of the abrupt impenetrable boundary\ndescribed by the equation: x = \u03b6(y) \u2261 W sin(2\u03c0y/\u03bb).\nTo the lowest order in W the boundary condition reads:\n\u03a8\u0302(0, y) + \u03b6(y)\n\nd\u03a8\u0302(0, y)\n=0\ndx\n\n(9)\n\nWe are looking for the solution in the perturbative form\n(0)\n(1)\n\u03a8\u0302\u00b1 (x, y) = \u03a8\u0302\u00b1 (x, y) + \u03a8\u0302\u00b1 (x, y), where the first order correction is proportional to W , and the zeroth\norder functions are given by Eqs.(2),(3).

Let us\ndiscuss now the next terms in Eq.15 proportional to\n1/\u03bb. As it is clear from Eq. 15, in general there are\noscillations with three different periods, namely, 2kF oscillations, and the oscillations\nwith two long periods:\nq\n\n2 \u2212 k 2 is the new length\n\u03be and Ls . Here \u03be = 1/ k\u2212\n+\nscale, and under the conditions considered in the paper\nwe have the set of inequalities \u03bbF \u226a \u03be \u226a Ls , where\nLs = 1/(k\u2212 \u2212 k+ ) = h\u0304/m\u03b1 is the spin precession length.\nWhen ky \u2192 k+ (i.e. k \u2192 0), then k1 tends to 1/\u03be, which\nclarifies the physical meaning of \u03be.\nWe calculate now the integrals entering expression Eq.\n15\nZ k+\n(k1 \u2213 k)2\n1\ncos(k \u2213 k1 )x,\ndky ky2\nI1,2 =\nkF 0\nkk1\n\n< Sz (x, y) >=\nI1/\u03be =\nI2kF = 2\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n1\n\n4kF2\n\nZ\n\nwhere the upper (minus) sign corresponds to I1 and the\nlower (plus) sign to I2 .

At even larger disN1 (x/Ls ) \u2212 x1 + 2 cos(x/\u03be)\nx\ns\ntances, x \u226b Ls , one obtains smooth oscillations with\nthe period of the\n\u221a order of Ls and the amplitude being\nproportional to \u03b1.\nIt should be noted that the term \u22121/x in Eq. (18)\nhas its origin in the interference of the incoming and\noutgoing waves, within each mode, with k \u2192 0 and\nk1 \u2192 0. Those waves travel almost parallel to the\nboundary, and have the scattering angle close to zero.\nNote that the total spin per unit length\nR along the\nboundary is proportional to \u221athe integral dxItot (x) \u2243\nR\u221e\nR \u03bb\u03bb\n(\u03c0/2Ls ) \u03be dxN1 (x/Ls ) \u2212 \u03be F dx/x \u2243 \u2212 ln(Ls /\u03be) \u2212\n\u221a\nln( \u03bb\u03bbF /\u03be) \u2243 \u2212(1/2) ln(\u03bb/\u03bbF ), i.e., it is not small in\ns-o coupling (which can be also seen directly from Eqs.\n(13) and (14)), in contrast to the case of the straight\nboundary.\nIn conclusion, we have considered the problem of the\nedge spin accumulation in the ballistic mesoscopic structures with spin-orbit-related splitting of the energy spectrum. In the presence of the charge current the spin polarization oscillates at the edge of the structure, as a result of the spin precession upon scattering off the boundary. The scattering states method, being more transparent compared to the methods used earlier by various\ngroups, has allowed us to clarify the physics associated\nwith this effect. We have found that the boundary conditions play a crucial role, even the shape of the sample\nboundary being important. In particular, in the case of\na straight boundary the absence of spin density oscillations with the long-wave length, found in earlier theoretical works, can be easily explained by the unitarity of\nscattering. On the other hand, the spin density accumulation in the case of a wiggly boundary has qualitatively\ndifferent character as compared to the one for the case of\na straight boundary, namely, the spin density oscillates\nwith a large period of the order of the spin precession\nlength, quite similar to the case of electron scattering\noff antidots in 2D system with the Rashba Hamiltonian\n[9]. Our analysis suggests that a smooth disorder at the\nboundary should induce spin oscillations with the long\nwave length. It also implies that in the ballistic case\nthere is no relation between the spin current in the bulk\nand the spin accumulation at the edge of an electron system.\nWe acknowledge the financial support from the Program \"Spintronics\" of RAS, the Russian Foundation for\nBasic Research (Grant No. 07-02-00164-a) and the Swiss\nNational Science Foundation.

This is no longer the case for 2D systems. Indeed, for a 2D system with the Rashba Hamiltonian the\nscattering problem of electrons off a circular scatterer\n(an antidot) may be solved exactly in the presence of the\ncharge current. Then, the condition of the unitarity of\nscattering has completely different form as compared to\nthe one for the case of scattering off the straight boundary. Therefore, Sz -component of the spin density, oscillating with period Ls , appears around the antidot and\ndecays as a power law of the distance from it [9].\n[9] A. Khaetskii, E.
