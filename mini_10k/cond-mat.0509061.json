In\nfact, their approach performs a mixing of waiting times coming from different spatial areas (or cells), which are characterized by disparate seismic rates. In particular, each area\nwill have a different rm , depending on its background seismicity level.

[4] analyzing diverse seismic catalogs, would imply the universality of seismicity spatial heterogeneities. In consequence, Bak et al.'s\nunified scaling law provides a way to measure these properties and is far from being as trivial as suggested by Lindman\net al.'s approach.\nThe model presented here is still too simple for real seismicity, but provides a clear visualization of its complexity and\nthe fundamentals of the unified scaling law of earthquakes.\n\u00c1lvaro Corral\u2217 and Kim Christensen\u2020\n\u2217 Departament de F\u0131\u0301sica, Universitat Aut\u00f2noma de Barcelona,\nE-08193 Bellaterra, Spain; \u2020 Blackett Laboratory, Imperial\nCollege, Prince Consort Road, London SW7 2BW, UK.\nJuly 22, 2018\nPACS numbers: 91.30.Dk, 05.65.+b, 89.75.Da\n\n[1]\n[2]\n[3]\n[4]\n\nM.
