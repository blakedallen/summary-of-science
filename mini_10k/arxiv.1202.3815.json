From\navailable observational data, we speculate that the ultra-faint dwarf galaxy population,\nor a significant fraction thereof, and the more luminous, classical dwarf spheroidal population were formed in different environments and would thus be distinct in origin.\n\n1.\n\nIntroduction\n\nLittle is known about the star formation process at the earliest cosmic times. Recent\nhydrodynamics simulations suggest that primordial stars might have been formed in\nbinary or small multiple systems (Stacy, Greif, & Bromm 2010). Assuming turbulent\ninitial conditions, Clark et al. (2011) showed that primordial stars could even have\nbeen formed in small, dense clusters. In their simulations, Wise et al. (2012) found\nthat most Pop II clusters below [Z/H] = \u22122 were formed with masses in the range\n5 \u00d7 102 . M\u2217 /M\u2299 . 104 , with a relative frequency resembling that of what is found\ntoday in the Galactic Disk (see their Fig. 6).\nThe most metal-poor star clusters known to date have an iron abundance just below\n[Fe/H] = \u22122. One of the globular clusters (Cluster 1) in the Fornax dwarf spheroidal\n(dSph) currently holds the record with a metallicity [Fe/H] = \u22122.5 (Letarte et al. 2006).\nHowever, not all clusters have survived as gravitationally bound objects to the present\nepoch. Much like the Galactic Halo, dwarf galaxies have stars with metallicities well\nbelow [Fe/H] = \u22123 (Kirby et al. 2008; Starkenburg et al. 2010). The relatively\nsimple environments of the low mass dwarf galaxies raises the prospect of identifying\ndisrupted star clusters at much lower metallicity than has been possible before through\nthe technique of chemical tagging (Bland-Hawthorn et al. 2010a,b). In the extension,\nthis also gives us a unique tool to probe the formation and early evolution of the present\ndwarf galaxy population.\n1\n\n\fTorgny Karlsson and Joss Bland-Hawthorn\n\n[Mg I/Fe I]\n\n\u22120.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.4\n\n0.4\n\n0.2\n0.0\n\n0.2\n0.0\n\n0.2\n0.0\n\n\u22120.2\n\n\u22120.2\n\n\u22121.2\n\n\u22120.4\n\n\u22120.4\n\n\u22120.4\n\n0.8\n\n\u22120.2\n\n0.6\n\n1.0\n\n0.4\n\n\u22120.4\n\n0.4\n\n0.0\n\u22120.4\n\n\u22120.6\n\u22120.8\n\n\u22120.8\n\u22123.6\n\n\u22123.2\n\u22122.8\n[Fe/H]\n\n\u22122.4\n\n\u22121.0\n\u22123.6\n\n[Ba II/Fe I]\n\n\u22120.2\n\n[Cr I/Fe I]\n\n[Ti II/Fe I]\n\n\u22120.8\n\n0.6\n\n0.4\n\n[Ni I/Fe I]\n\n[Na I/Fe I]\n\n0.0\n\n0.6\n\n[Sc II/Fe I]\n\n0.4\n\n[Ca I /Fe I]\n\n2\n\n0.2\n\n0.0\n\n\u22121.0\n\n0.0\n\n\u22123.2\n\u22122.8\n[Fe/H]\n\n\u22122.4\n\n\u22120.2\n\u22123.6\n\n\u22123.2\n\u22122.8\n[Fe/H]\n\n\u22122.4\n\n\u22122.0\n\u22123.6\n\n\u22123.2\n\u22122.8\n[Fe/H]\n\n\u22122.4\n\nFigure 1. Chemical abundance ratios of six very metal-poor stars in the Sextans\ndSph. Abundance data are taken from Aoki et al. (2009). Stars are color coded\naccording to their location in the [Mg/Fe] \u2013 [Fe/H] diagram. The three stars with\nnearly identical [Mg/Fe] (colored in different shades of blue) also have very similar\n[Fe/H]. These stars all clump together in Ti, Cr, and Ba, as well.\n\nIn the following sections, we will demonstrate the possible existence, estimate the\ninitial mass, and discuss the likely nature of a disrupted stellar cluster at [Fe/H] = \u22122.7\nin the Sextans dSph. We end by briefly explore the implications for near-field cosmology and the possibility that the population of ultra-faint dwarfs and the more luminous,\nclassical dSphs have a different origin.\n2.\n\nObservational evidences\n\nBased on high-resolution (R \u2243 40, 000) spectroscopy, Aoki et al. (2009) recently determined the chemical abundances of six very metal-poor stars ([Fe/H] < \u22122.5) in the\nSextans dSph. Their excellent analysis revealed a group of four stars that display a subzero [Mg/Fe] ratio with a small scatter around the weighted mean h[Mg/Fe]i = \u22120.06\n(see Fig. 1). This is in contrast to the Mg-to-Fe enhancements commonly observed in\nGalactic Halo stars of similar metallicity (Cayrel et al. 2004). A closer inspection of\nFig. 1 shows that three (colored in shades of blue) of the four stars more or less tightly\nclump together in Ti, Cr and Ba as well. Two out of three \"blue\" stars also have similar\nNa, Ca and Sc abundances (Sc was not measured in the dark blue star S 10 \u2212 14). As\nAoki et al. (2009) points out, the higher [Ca/Fe] ratio in S 14 \u2212 98 (medium blue) could\nsimply be due to a larger observational uncertainty in Ca for this star. In terms of the\nchemistry, the star S 11 \u2212 37 (color coded green in Fig. 1) may be regarded as a borderline case. However, since it is slightly off (1 \u2212 2\u03c3) in Sc, Ti, and Ba we will not regard\nthis star as a member of the \"blue\" group. We will return to the low Na abundance of\nS 10 \u2212 14 in Sect. 3.\nStarkenburg et al. (2010) determined re-calibrated metallicities for metal-poor\nstars in four classical dSphs, including Sextans. The new data reveal an excess of stars\nin the metallicity distribution function (MDF) of Sextans around [Fe/H] \u2243 \u22122.9. Assuming a typical enhancement of h[Ca/Fe]i = +0.25 in metal-poor stars (Starkenburg\net al. 2010), this \"bump\" should be found at [Ca/H] \u2243 \u22122.65 (see Fig. 2).

The black, solid line denotes\nthe fiducial distribution of [Ca/H], predicted from our stochastic chemical evolution\nmodel while the black, dashed line denotes the corresponding distribution, including\nan M\u22c6 = 2.0 \u00d7 105 M\u2299 star cluster at [Ca/H] = \u22122.65 (arrow). Both MDFs are\nconvolved with a \u03c3 = 0.2 dex gaussian. The light-grey shaded area contains 12.3%\nof the total stellar mass. The red step function (with Poissonian noise) shows the\nobserved distribution of [Ca/H] (Starkenburg et al. 2010).\n\nthis is close to the weighted mean abundance of Ca for the three \"blue\" stars identified\nin the data of Aoki et al. (2009).\nIf real, the \"bump\" could be due to the presence of a relic cluster. In conjunction\nwith our finding above, we will argue that the \"blue\" stars in Fig. 1 once were members\nof a chemically homogeneous star cluster that is now, at least partly, dissolved. This\nconclusion is also in accord with the detection of a kinematically cold substructure in\nthe central region of Sextans, possibly originating from a remnant star cluster (Battaglia\net al. 2011). The substructure has an observed mean metallicity of [Fe/H] \u2243 \u22122.6\n(Battaglia et al. 2011), which is very close to that of the \"blue\" group of stars.\n3.\n\nStellar mass and nature of relic cluster\n\nWe first estimate the initial mass of the potential star cluster by measuring the size of\nthe \"bump\" in the MDF of Sextans (Fig. 2). By comparing the observed MDF with the\nMDF predicted from our stochastic chemical evolution model (for details, see Karlsson\net al. 2012), we determine the initial mass to M\u2217,init = 2.0 (1.6) \u00d7 105 M\u2299 for a Salpeter\n(Kroupa, Kroupa 2001) initial mass function (IMF). At face value, the identification of\nthe three \"blue\" stars in Fig. 1, if they do belong to a dispersed cluster, point towards a\ncluster mass in the range 2.2 \u00d7 105 \u2264 M\u2217,init /M\u2299 \u2264 3.6 \u00d7 105 . Given this conditional\n\n\fTorgny Karlsson and Joss Bland-Hawthorn\n\n4\n\nconstraint, the combined estimate of the most probable mass of the dissolved cluster\n+1.2\n5\n(with asymmetric uncertainties) is determined to M\u2217,init = 1.9+1.5\n\u22120.9 (1.6\u22120.8 ) \u00d7 10 M\u2299 ,\nfor a Salpeter (Kroupa) IMF (Karlsson et al. 2012).\nGlobular clusters show specific elemental abundance correlations, such as the NaO and the Al-Mg anti-correlations. These are not present in open clusters and could\ntherefore be used as discriminators between the two types of clusters. Interestingly, the\nstar S 10 \u2212 14 (dark blue) has a significantly lower Na abundance than the other two\npotential cluster stars (see Fig. 1). This may be suggestive of an Na-O anti-correlation\npresent in the data. The fact that one out of three stars show a low [Na/Fe] is also\nconsistent with the fraction of globular cluster stars exhibiting primordial abundances\n(Carretta et al. 2009). Along with the inferred initial mass, we conclude that the relic\ncluster might have been a globular cluster. Further observations, including O and Al\nabundances are, however, required in order to readily determine the nature of the cluster.\n4.\n\nOn the origin of ultra-faint dwarfs and dSphs\n\nA comparison between models and available metallicity data for dSphs and ultra-faints\nsuggests that the formation of clusters in the ultra-faints differed from that of the dSphs\n(Karlsson et al. 2012). Together with a detected offset between the mean cumulative metallicity functions of the ultra-faints and the dSphs, and a putative offset in the\nh[Mg/Fe]i ratio, we speculate that these two types of galaxies probably were formed\nin different environments and would therefore be distinct in origin. A possible explanation to the apparent absence of clumping in the ultra-faints below [Fe/H] = \u22122.5\nis that these galaxies were formed predominantly before the local Universe was reionized, while the dSphs formed mostly after reionization. However, whether there is a\ndichotomy, as suggested by the current observational data, or a continuous distribution\nof galaxies exhibiting a mix of properties should be investigated further.\nReferences\nAoki, W., Arimoto, N., Sadakane, K., Tolstoy, E., Battaglia, G., Jablonka, P., Shetrone, M.,\nLetarte, B., Irwin, M., Hill, V., et al. 2009, A&A, 502, 569.\nBattaglia, G., Tolstoy, E., Helmi, A., Irwin, M., Parisi, P., Hill, V., & Jablonka, P. 2011, MNRAS, 411, 1013.\nBland-Hawthorn, J., Karlsson, T., Sharma, S., Krumholz, M., & Silk, J. 2010a, ApJ, 721, 582\nBland-Hawthorn, J., Krumholz, M., & Freeman, K. 2010b, ApJ, 713, 166\nCarretta, E., Bragaglia, A., Gratton, R.
