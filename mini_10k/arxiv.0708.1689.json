The Drell-Yan (DY) production of\ndi-leptons [2], which is one of the dominant production processes at hadron colliders, can be used\nto precisely calibrate the experimental detectors. In addition, the DY process provides precise\nmeasurements of various standard model parameters through measurements of the rapidity distributions of Z bosons [3] and charge asymmetries of leptons coming from W boson decays [4].\nPossible excess events in di-lepton invariant mass distributions can point to physics beyond the\nstandard model, such as R-parity violating supersymmetric models, models with Z\u2032 , or with contact interactions [5] and gravity mediated models (see [6] for recent update). The precise measurements of Z and W boson production cross sections, various distributions\n\u221a and asymmetries by both\nthe D0 and CDF collaborations [7] at the Fermilab Tevatron, where S = 1.96 TeV, have already\nprovided stringent tests of the standard model. These have already played an important role in\nbounding the mass of the Higgs boson. Similar measurements\n\u221a at the LHC will provide even more\nstringent tests due to the increase in the number of events at S = 14 TeV.\nThe total cross sections for the Z and W \u00b1 production are known in pQCD up to next-to-nextto-leading order (N2 LO) [8\u201314]. Resummation programs for the threshold corrections to the total\ncross sections for DY production of di-leptons are also known [15, 16] (see also [17]) and one\ncan consult [18, 19] for next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic (N2 LL) resummation results so it is\nstraightforward to study the threshold effects in Z and W \u00b1 production at the cross section level.\nRecent QCD results at the three loop level [20\u201326] have lead to predictions for the resummation up\nto N3 LL [27\u201330]. Notice that the fixed order partial-soft-plus-virtual N3 LO corrections [27, 30] to\nthe Higgs and DY production show the reliability of the perturbation theory results and demonstrate\nstability against the variations of renormalization and mass factorization scales. Exact results up\nto N2 LO are also available for less inclusive observables for di-lepton [31], Z and W \u00b1 [32] (see\n[33\u201335]) production. Recently the dominant QCD threshold corrections to the rapidity distribution\nof di-leptons in the DY process at N3 LO have been obtained in [36]. It was found that these\ncorrections are indeed small and reduce the scale uncertainties significantly making the predictions\nmore reliable. The fixed order results as well as the resummed results reveal very interesting\nstructures in the perturbative QCD series (see, [37\u201342]).\nThe hard scattering cross sections computed using the QCD improved parton model are often\nsensitive to variations in the renormalisation and factorisation scales usually denoted by \u03bcR and \u03bcF\nrespectively. The former originate from ultraviolet renormalisation while the latters originate in the\nmass factorisation of collinear singularities. In addition to the scale uncertainties the fixed order\ncomputations suffer from the presence of various large logarithms which arise in some kinematical\nregions. These regions are often important from the experimental point of view and these large\nlorgarithms, which spoil the standard perturbative predictions, should be resummed in a closed\nform. For instance resummation formulae supplemented with fixed order results can predict the\ndominant higher order threshold corrections to various observables. These threshold corrections\nare large when the fluxes of the incoming partons are large, which occurs at large partonic energies.\n1\n\n\fIn [37] we computed the soft distribution functions that resum the soft gluons coming from\nreal gluon emission processes in DY production and Higgs production and also found that they\nare related by the colour factor CA /CF , see also [43] and [44]. Using the soft distribution functions extracted from DY, and the form factor of the Yukawa coupling of Higgs to bottom quarks,\nwe predicted the soft-plus-virtual (sv) parts of the Higgs production cross section through bottom\nquark annihilation beyond N2 LO with the same accuracy that the DY process and the gluon fusion to Higgs process are known [27, 30]. This approach was then successfully applied in [38]\nto Higgs decay to bottom quarks and hadroproduction in e+ e\u2212 annihilation. Since our results\nin [30, 37, 38] are related to that of the standard threshold resummation, we could determine [37]\nthe threshold exponents DIi up to three loop level for DY and Higgs production using our resummed soft distribution functions and the quantities BIi for deep inelastic scattering, Higgs decay\nand the hadroproduction of Higgs bosons. In [36] we extended this approach to include xF and\nrapidity differential cross sections for di-lepton pairs in DY production and for Higgs bosons in\nHiggs production processes. In this paper we apply these same methods to study the effects of the\ndominant threshold corrections at N3 LO to the rapidity distributions of the Z and W \u00b1 bosons in\nhadron-hadron collisions.\nIn [36] we formulated a framework to resum the dominant soft gluon contributions coming\nfrom the threshold region to the xF and rapidity distributions of DY di-lepton pairs and Higgs\nbosons at hadron colliders in the zi (i = 1, 2) space of the kinematic variables. We recapitulate the\nmain points here to make this paper more understandable. The threshold region corresponds to\nzi \u2192 1 and in this region all the partonic cross sections are symmetric in z1 \u2194 z2 . To obtain the\nresummed result, we used renormalisation group (RG) invariance, mass factorisation and Sudakov\nresummation of QCD amplitudes. Using the resummed results in zi space we predicted the sv parts\n(also called threshold corrections) of the dominant partonic xF and rapidity distributions beyond\nN2 LO. We follow the similar approach here to obtain the dominant threshold corrections at N3 LO\nlevel for the rapidity distributions of Z and W \u00b1 bosons at both the LHC and Tevatron energies.\nSee [45] for an early reference where the resummation for DY differential distributions at rapidity\nY = 0 (or xF = 0) was considered.\nThe differential cross section for producing a vector boson can be expressed as:\nd 2\u03c3 J\nJ\n= \u03c3Born\n(x01 , x02 , q2 )W I (x01 , x02 , q2 ) ,\ndq2 dy\n\n(1)\n\nwhere q is the four-momentum of the vector boson. In our case q2 = MJ2 where J = Z,W \u00b1 but\n2 for most of this paper. Later we will present plots for d 2 \u03c3 J /dqdy,\nfor convenience we use qp\nwhere q now represents q2 = MZ or MW for Z and W \u00b1 respectively. Our normalisation is\nI (x0 , x0 , q2 ) = \u03b4(1 \u2212 x0 )\u03b4(1 \u2212 x0 ). The superscript I represents light-quarks (q), gluons (g)\nWBorn\n1 2\n1\n2\nand heavy quarks (b) but we only need the first case here so I = q for the rest of the paper.

The soft parts\ncome from the soft gluons that appear in real emission as well as in the virtual processes. The\ninfra-red safe contributions from the soft gluons can be obtained by adding the soft parts of the\ndifferential cross sections with the ultraviolet renormalised virtual contributions and performing\nmass factorisation using appropriate counter terms. These combinations are called the \"soft-plusvirtual\" (sv) parts of the differential cross sections. Hence we write\n2 2 2\nsv\n2 2 2\n\u2206Id,ab (z1 , z2 , q2 , \u03bc2F , \u03bc2R ) = \u2206hard\nI,ab (z1 , z2 , q , \u03bcF , \u03bcR ) + \u03b4ab \u2206 d,I (z1 , z2 , q , \u03bcF , \u03bcR ),\n\nI = q.\n\n(5)\n\n2 2 2\nThe hard parts of the differential cross sections \u2206hard\nI,ab (z1 , z2 , q , \u03bcF , \u03bcR ) can be obtained by the\nstandard procedure(see [6, 46]).

The F\u0302 I (\u00e2s, Q2 , \u03bc2 , \u03b5) are the standard form factors coming from the purely\nvirtual parts of the cross sections. In the form factors, we have Q2 = \u2212MJ2 . The partonic cross\nsections depend on two scaling variables z1 and z2 . The functions \u03a6dI (\u00e2s , q2 , \u03bc2 , z1, z2 , \u03b5) are called\nthe soft distribution functions.

The bare coupling constant \u00e2s is related to renormalised one by\nthe following relation:\n\u03bc2\nS\u03b5 \u00e2s = Z(\u03bc2R )as (\u03bc2R ) 2\n\u03bcR\n\u0012\n\n\u0013 \u03b52\n\n,\n\n(11)\n\n\b\nwhere S\u03b5 = exp \u03b52 [\u03b3E \u2212 ln 4\u03c0] is the spherical factor characteristic of n-dimensional regularisation. The renormalisation constant Z(\u03bc2R ) relates the bare coupling constant \u00e2s to the renormalised\none as (\u03bc2R ). They are both expressed in terms of the perturbatively calculable coefficients \u03b2i which\nare known up to four-loop level [47, 48] in terms of the colour factors of SU(N) gauge group:\nCA = N,\n\nCF =\n\nN2 \u2212 1\n,\n2N\n\nTF =\n\n1\n.\n2\n\n(12)\n\nAlso we use n f for the number of active flavours.\nIn dimensional regularisation, the bare form factors F\u0302 I (\u00e2s , Q2 , \u03bc2 , \u03b5) satisfy the following differential equation [49\u201352].\n\u0014 \u0012\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0013\u0015\n\u0001\n\u03bc2R\nQ2 \u03bc2R\n1 I\n2 d\n2 2\nI\n\u02c6\nI\nQ\nK \u00e2s , 2 , \u03b5 + G \u00e2s , 2 , 2 , \u03b5 .\nln F \u00e2s , Q , \u03bc , \u03b5 =\n(13)\ndQ2\n2\n\u03bc\n\u03bcR \u03bc\n4\n\n\fThe fact that the F\u0302 I (\u00e2s, Q2 , \u03bc2 , \u03b5) are renormalisation group invariant and the functions GI are\nfinite implies that the K I terms can be expressed in terms of finite constants AI , the so-called cusp\nanomalous dimensions and the coefficients \u03b2i . The formal solution to the eqn.(13), in dimensional\nregularisation, up to four-loop level is obtained in [22,37]. The finite constants Gi I (\u03b5) (see eqn.(19)\nof [30]) are also known [23] to the required accuracy in \u03b5. These constants Gi I (\u03b5) are expressed\nin terms of the functions BIi and fiI . The BIi are known up to order a3s through the three-loop\nanomalous dimensions (or splitting functions) [20, 21] and are found to be flavour independent,\nq\nthat is Bi = Bbi . The constants fiI are analogous to the cusp anomalous dimensions AIi that enter\nq\nthe form factors with Ai = Abi . It was first noticed in [43] that the single pole terms in \u03b5 in the\nlogarithms of the quark and gluon form factors up to two-loop level (a2s ) can be predicted by the\nCF \u2192 CA substitution. The structure of single pole terms of four-point amplitudes at the two-loop\nlevel can be found in [53, 54]. The UV divergences present in the form factor are removed when\nthe bare coupling constant \u00e2s undergoes renormalisation via the eqn.(11).\nThe collinear singularities that arise due to the presence of massless partons are removed using\nthe mass factorisation kernels \u0393(z j , \u03bc2F , \u03b5) in the MS scheme (see eqn.(7)). We suppress their dependence on \u00e2s and \u03bc2 . The factorisation kernels \u0393(z j , \u03bc2F , \u03b5) satisfy the following renormalisation\ngroup equations:\n\u0001\n\u0001\nd\n1\n\u03bc2F 2 \u0393(z j , \u03bc2F , \u03b5) = P z j , \u03bc2F \u2297 \u0393 z j , \u03bc2F , \u03b5\nj = 1, 2 ,\n(14)\n2\nd\u03bcF\nwhere the P(z j , \u03bc2F ) are the DGLAP matrix-valued splitting functions which are known up to threeloop level [20, 21]:\n\u221e\n\nP(z j , \u03bc2F ) = \u2211 ais (\u03bc2F )P(i\u22121) (z j ) .\n\n(15)\n\ni=1\n\nThe diagonal terms in the splitting functions P(i) (z j ) have the following structure\n\u0014\n\u0015\n(i)\n(i)\nI\nI\nPII (z j ) = 2 Bi+1 \u03b4(1 \u2212 z j ) + Ai+1 D0 (z j ) + Preg,II (z j ) ,\n\n(16)\n\n(i)\n\nwhere Preg,II (z j ) are regular when the argument approaches the kinematic limit (here z j \u2192 1). The\nRG equations can be solved by expanding them in powers of the strong coupling constant. Only\nthe diagonal parts of the kernels contribute to the sv parts of the differential cross sections.

There\nare two panels in this plot and two curves in each panel since we show the scale variations by varying the mass factorization scale \u03bcF in the parton densities and the mass renormalization scale \u03bcR\nin the coefficient functions. Therefore we plot the curves at fixed \u03bc2F = MZ2 but with \u03bc2R = MZ2 /2\nand \u03bc2R = 2MZ2 in the left panel and fixed \u03bc2R = MZ2 but with \u03bc2F = MZ2 /2 and \u03bc2F = 2MZ2 in the right\npanel. Our results in the left panel show that there is only a tiny dependence on the \u03bcR for fixed\n\u03bcF (here the LO result has no variation). In the right panel we see that \u03bcF dependence for fixed \u03bcR\ndecreases as we go from LO to NLO, N2 LO and N3 LO respectively. The N3 LO band lies within\nthe N2 LO band and both are within the bands for the NLO results. We also notice that the lower\ncurves for the N2 LO and N3 LO results fall on top of each other. The actual numbers are different\nbut so close that one cannot see this from the plot. These results demonstrate that the perturbation\nseries for the rapidity distribution converges very nicely at the LHC energy.\n\nIn fig. 2 we plot the rapidity distributions for the W + -boson at the LHC in LO (dotted lines),\nNLO (solid lines), N2 LO(SV only, dot-dashed lines) and N3 LO (pSV only, small-dashed lines).\nWe have only plotted the curves above 200 pb/GeV to magnify the central rapidity region.

In the right panel we see that \u03bcF dependence for fixed\n\u03bcR decreases as we go from LO to NLO, N2 LO and N3 LO respectively. However the N3 LO band\nis slightly below the N2 LO band near y = 0 even though both are within the bands for the NLO\nresults, which is probably caused by the fact that we only have a partial soft-plus-virtual N3 LO\nresult. We notice again that the lower curves for the N2 LO and N3 LO results in the right panel fall\non top of each other. The actual numbers are different but so close that one cannot see this from\nthe plot. Both plots indicate that the perturbation series is rapidly converging at the LHC energy.\nIn figures 3 and 4 we repeat these plots for the Tevatron energy and the same scale choices as\nabove. The left panel in Fig. 3 shows excellent convergence of our results. Note that we only plot\nour results above 5 pb/GeV to magnify the central rapidity region. However the right panel shows\nthat the bands for the N3 LO result are wider than those for the N2 LO result and both are wider than\nthose for the NLO result. This can have two reasons. One is that our results are only sv or partial\nsv. The other is that since the Tevatron is an antiproton-proton collider different combinations of\nparton densities are involved as we increase the order of the perturbation series.

We notice again that the lower curves for the N2 LO and N3 LO results in the right\npanel fall on top of each other. The actual numbers are different but so close that one cannot see\nthis from the plot.\nFigure 4 shows results for W + production above 40 pb/GeV to concentrate on the central\nrapidity region. The curves in the left panel show excellent convergence of the perturbation series.\nThe right panel again shows that the bands for the N3 LO result are wider than those for the N2 LO\nresult and both are wider than those for the NLO result. Again we believe that this is caused by a\ncombination of the reasons above and comment on it below. We notice again that the lower curves\nfor the N2 LO and N3 LO results in the right panel fall on top of each other. The actual numbers are\ndifferent but so close that one cannot see this from the plot.\nNote that the asymmetry about y = 0 in the rapidity plots for W + production at the Tevatron in\nFig.4 has basically disappeared at the LHC energy (see Fig.2).\nWe have checked our results in two ways. First by comparing our curves with similar plots\nfor the rapidity distributions in [12]. Their computer program for the rapidity distributions has\nthe exact LO result, the exact NLO result and a sv approximation for the N2 LO result. We agree\nwith their numbers when we choose their values for the electroweak parameters and their parton\ndensities. Second we have also checked our results against those in [32], where the exact N2 LO\n\n12\n\n\frapidity distributions for the Z and W \u00b1 bosons are calculated. Their paper contains plots for the\nexact LO, the exact NLO and the exact N2 LO results in pQCD. We have run their computer code to\ncompare their results against ours. Our sv approximation agrees very well with their N2 LO results\nin the case when \u03bcF = \u03bcR = MJ /2 for the Z and W \u00b1 bosons. However we get a slightly wider\nband when we vary the scales in the N2 LO case, since we only have a sv approximation. From this\ncomparison we can see that the wider bands we observe in Figures 3 and 4 are basically due to the\nsv and partial sv nature of our higher order results. We can probably reduce the width of the bands\nin the N3 LO case by calculating the missing pieces of the partial sv result. However the central\nvalue of our partial sv N3 LO result is very small when compared with the N2 LO result indicating\nthat the perturbation series continues to converge rather rapidly. Hence this is good news for the\nLHC experimenters who plan to calibrate the Atlas and CMS detectors by measuring the rapidity\nand transverse momentum distributions of Z and W \u00b1 bosons.\nTo summarise, we have systematically studied higher order sv corrections to rapidity differential distributions for Z and W \u00b1 boson production. We have used Sudakov resummation of soft\ngluons to calculate these processes. The resummation of soft gluons has been achieved using renormalisation group invariance and the factorisation property of the observable that is considered here\n(the rapidity). Using the available information on the form factors, the DGLAP kernels and lower\norder results we have obtained compact expressions for the resummation of soft gluons for the\nrapidity distributions of Z and W \u00b1 bosons. Using these we have computed sv rapidity distributions\nexactly at N2 LO and partially at N3 LO. We have presented the numerical impact of these results.\nAcknowledgments: We would like to thank Prof. P. van Baal for hospitality at the Lorentz\nInstitute in Leiden where this paper was completed.
