INTRODUCTION\nRecent advances in communication technology have\ncreated the opportunity for mobile terminals to receive many\nservices that were, until not long ago, only available to\ntethered terminals. This system to support large scale mobility\nwas the advanced mobile phone system. A new digital system,\npersonal Communication System (PCS) provides voice as well\nas data services to wireless users. PCS works in the GSM\n800/1900 MHz spectrum. There are competitive standards for\nanalog, digital, and PCS system throughout the world [1].\nOne of the challenging tasks in a PCS environment is to\nefficiently maintain the location of the PCS subscribers in\nGSM who move around freely with their wireless unit. In\nIndia TRAI (Telephonic Regulatory Authority of India) is\nused for managing location information of the subscribers and\nenabling them to send and receive calls and other services\nsuch as messaging and data service.\n\nSystems Engineer\nAITS\nRajampet\ne-mail: seetharam.p@gmail.com\n\nThe cells are established as we have shown in figure 1,\nusing which mobile subscribers move between them and he\nmake calls for transmitting voice/data.\nThe network reference model of a Personal\nCommunication System in GSM network is shown in figure 2\nwe refined for supporting and understanding of my work .It\nconsists of the following components [2].\nHome Location Register (HLR): Maintains the profiles of\nthe entire subscribers that are registered with the home\nnetwork. When a mobile subscriber roams to another area, it\nhas to register with the Visitor Location Register (VLR) of\nthat area. The HLR maintains a pointer to the VLR which\ncurrently serve the mobile.\nVisitor Location Register (VLR): Supports registration,\nauthentication, and call routing to/from a mobile while it is\naway from its home area. Each MSC has a VLR to holds the\ndata relevant for handling calls from and to the MSs that are\ncurrently located in its area. The relevant data is downloaded\nfrom the home HLR when the mobile subscriber switches on\nthe mobile handset in the area of the visited MSC thereby\ninitiating the process of registration. VLR holds the exact\nlocation of the MS and keeps on updating the location as the\nmobile move across its area.\n\nBase Stations\nMSC\n\nMSC\nHLR\n\nTo other\nMSCs\n\nVLR\n\nHLR\nVLR\n\nPSTN\nFigure 1: Network Reference Model\n\nMobile Switching Center (MSC): Responsible for\nswitching the voice/data connection to the mobile host.

It provides the\nwireless connection to the mobile subscribers within its\ncoverage area (Cell). A set of base stations are connected to\nthe MSC through a Base Station controller.\nAuthenticating Center (AC or AuC): The Authentication\nCenter is a workstation system, which authenticates\nsubscribers. AuC needs to access user information for\nauthentication process so it is co-located with HLR.\nEquipment Identify Register (EIR): It is a database which\nstores information for the identification of mobile units.\nPublic Switched Telephone Network (PSTN): This\ncomponent refers to the regular wired line telecommunication\nnetwork which is commonly accessed by landline calls.\nIntegrated Service Digital Network (ISDN): It is a wired\nline network which provides enhanced digital services to\nsubscribers.\nFor supporting our work, we studied Nellore District\nBSNL office functionality and we find the existing\narchitecture for GSM network as shown in figure 3.\nEvery subscriber is registered with a home network, the\nHLR of which maintains the subscriber's current physical\nlocation. This physical location is the LAI is the ID of the\nMSC currently serving the subscriber. If the subscriber has\nmoved to another region then he/she has to register with the\nVLR that covers the new region. During registration, the VLR\nwill contact the subscriber's HLR, and the HLR will update its\ndatabase to reflect the new location of the subscriber. If the\nmobile has registered with some other VLR before, HLR will\nsend a registration cancellation message to it.\nPresent system is having the disadvantage in call setup and\ncall delivery using the traditional centralized database system.\nOne disadvantage is that since every location request as well\nas location registration are serviced through a HLR, in\naddition to the HLR being over loaded with database lookup\noperations [1] [3] [6]; the traffic on the links leading to the\nHLR is heavy. The other disadvantage is that any HLR to be\nunreachable even though mobiles may be roaming and away.\n\nIn view of above disadvantages, we are proposing\nintelligent location management approaches for to overcome\nall the disadvantages faced by the system. This effort will\nreduce the transition time between the VLR and HLR\ndatabases when the common MS roams to that MSC services\narea\nIn this paper, fuzzy logic concept is used for supporting\nproposed intelligent location management schemes, fuzzy\nlogic deals with vague, doubtful and ambiguous data for\ngiving better results for uncertain data in mobile networks.\nVagueness or doubtfulness means that cannot be defined or\ndetermined data. In general, vagueness is as associated with\nthe difficulty of making sharp or precise distinctions in the\nworld. That is some domain of interest is vague if it cannot be\ndelimited by sharp boundaries [14].\nAmbiguity is associated with one-to-many relations that\nare situations in which the choice between two or three more\nalternatives is left unspecified. In this is paper we are\nproposing the techniques that can work easily to see that the\nconcept of a fuzzy sets provides a base mathematical\nframework for dealing with vagueness. Section 2 describes\nthe existing databases system and approaches, section 3\ndescribes the proposed intelligent system and concluding\nremarks is presented in section 4.\nII.BACKGROUND AND EXISTING SYSTEM\nLocation management includes two major tasks: Location\nregistration and call delivery. Location registration procedures\nupdate the location database (HLR and VLRs) when an MT\nmoves into different location area. Call delivery procedure\nlocate a Mobile Station (MS) based on the information\navailable at HLR and VLRs when a call for the MS is\ninitiated.\nIn GSM network, there are two kinds of databases: HLR\nand VLR are used to store the location information of MSs.\nThe whole network coverage area is divided into cells as\nshown in figure 1. There is a base station installed in each cell\nand an MS within a cell communicates with the network\nthrough a base station. These cells are grouped together to\nfrom a larger area called a registration area (RA)/Location\n\n\fArea (LA). All the base stations belonging to one LA are\nwired to a mobile switching center (MSC) through BTS and\nBSC which serves as the interface between the wireless and\nthe wired networks. In this paper, we assume that one VLR is\nassociated with each MSC as we shown in figure3.\nA Location Area (LA) as shown in figure 3 is defined as a\ngroup of cells. Within the network, a subscriber location is\nknown by the location area which they are in and is controlled\nby a Base Station Controller (BSC). The identification of a\nlocation area in which an MS is currently located is stored in\nthe VLR.\nWhen a MS crosses a boundary from a cell belonging to\none LA into a cell belonging to another LA, it must report its\nnew location to the network. When a MS crosses a cell\nboundary within a location area, it does need to report its new\nlocation to the network. But when a MS leaves the MSC\nservice area, the scenario changes and updating information is\nincreased. The VLR is always integrated with the MSC as\nshown in figure 3 and there is one VLR for each MSC service\narea.\n\nStep1: The VLR checks its database to determine whether\nor not it has a record for the MS. And this checking is based\non the subscribers IMSI.\nStep2: VLR sends a request to the subscribers HLR for a\ncopy of the MS's subscription when it does not find any\nrecord for the corresponding MS\nStep3: the HLR passes the information to the VLR and\nupdates its location information for the subscriber.\nStep4: the HLR instructs the old VLR to delete the\ninformation that was stored in the database.\nStep5: the VLR stores its subscription information for MS,\nincluding the latest location and status (idle). This maintains of\ntwo databases at HLR and VLR gives a flexible mechanism to\nsupport call routing and dialing in a roaming situation.\nTwo major steps are involved in call delivery: determining\nthe serving VLR of called MT, and locating the visiting cell of\ncalled MT. The following step occurs in call delivery shown in\nfigure 5 [5]\n\nThe VLR can be regarded as a distributed HLR as it holds\na copy of the HLR information stored about the subscriber [5].\nThe data stored includes:\n\nHLR\n\n1. Mobile subscriber Roaming number (MSRN)\n2. Service type (services that the subscriber is allowed\nto access)\n\nMSC Mobile Switching Center\nHLR Home Location Register\nVLR Visitor Location Register\n\n(2)\n\n3. Current location\n\n(4)\n\n(5)\n\n(3)\n\n4. HLR address Ciphering keys\n(6)\n\n5. Billing information\n6. International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI)\n\nVLR\n\nMSC\n\nMSC\n\n(1)\n\n7. Subscribers phone number\n\nVLR\n\nCalling MT\n\n8. Access point subscribed (GPRS)\n9. Temporary Mobile Subscriber Identity (TMSI)\nWhen a subscriber roams into a new MSC service area, the\nfollowing steps occur in figure 4 [5]\nHLR\n\nBTS\n\nFigure 5: Call delivery procedure\n\nStep1: Calling MT sends call initiated signal to its serving\nMSC through the base station.\nStep2: MSC of calling MT, calling MSC, sends the\nlocation request message to HLR of called MT.\n\n(6)\n(3)\n(5)\n\nCalling MT\nBTS\n\n(4)\n\nMSC Mobile Switching Center\nHLR Home Location Register\nVLR Visitor Location Register\n\nStep3: HLR of called MT determines the current serving\nVLR of called MT and sends the route request message to the\nassociated MSC, called MSC.\n\nMSC\n\nVLR\n\nMSC\n\nVLR\n\n(2)\n(1)\n\nStep5: HLR forwards TLDN to calling MSC\n\nBS\nLA Boundary\n\nStep4: Called MSC determines the cell location of called\nMT and assigns temporary location directory number (TLDN)\nto called MT. called MT MSC then sends this routing\ninformation (TLDN) to HLR\n\nBS\n\nFigure 4: Call registration procedure\n\nStep6: calling MSC requests a call setup to called MSC\nthrough the SS7 network.\n\n\fIn the existing system, when subscriber is moved from one\nbase station to other base station, subscriber's details are\ntransferred to another base station VLR (data is transferred\nfrom HLR). If call is disconnected the same record stored at\nVLR is deleted automatically. For solving above problem we\nare proposing new approaches and these approaches are\nmotivated from several works which were already done. In\npast studies [6] they proposed a novel mechanism for the\nVLR interaction methods where it has been given the potential\nto be intelligent to find the common users for the MSC service\narea. This effort will reduce traffic load and also improve\nspectrum efficiency. Moreover they concluded that, it reduces\ntransition between VLR and HLR Therefore, it can play a\nsignificant role to support large number of traffic in the\nfuture cellular networks. In work [7] similar to [6] but they\nproposed fVLR, registration procedure of a mobile station\nlocation is described and a call setup procedure. They said to\nstore and manage subscriber visits in fVLR database of which\na mobile user frequently visits location. And then when set up\nthe call path between mobile users, the VLR of the caller\nqueries callee's fVLR for searching the location of callee\ninstead of requesting to HLR of the callee. In this work fVLR\ncan be well applied to the mobile users that live a well\nregulated life. In another study [10] proposed intelligent\napproach by taking the User Profile History (UPH); to reduce\nthe location update cost. They obtained results the efficiency\nof UPH in significantly reducing the costs of both location\nupdates and call delivery. In another study [12] proposed\nfuzzy logic approaches for user location tracking which is\nhighly motivated us to work on these approaches for location\nmanagement. In this study [13] demonstrate the sum of update\nand lookup costs of the location database must be minimized.\nAlong with these\nAs per intelligent database system for location\nmanagement, record will not be removed immediately from\nthe VLR even subscribers is changed his/her MS. Proposed\nsystem will store for few days if any repetitions calls to the\nsame base station occurs. Its means that system will act\nintelligently to take the decision, then removes the record from\nthe VLR.\n3. PROPOSED SYSTEM\nUsually when the Mobile Station leaves one MSC service\narea to another, all the information related to the Mobile\nStation user is deleted (based on the subscribers IMSI or\nTMSI). Here in the proposed method deletion will be done\ndepending on a decision that will be taken after doing some\nanalysis during certain amount of time frame: 1) The VLR will\nhave been observing the mobile station roaming habit for\nsome days , for example 'n' days. 2) The VLR will also\nobserve the time when the Mobile station roams into the MSC\narea. Depending on these data, a query will be done and the\nresult of the query will help to decide that whether the\ninformation of mobile station will be stored inside the VLR or\nbe dropped. The goal of the query is to find those mobile\nusers who used to visit the MSC service area at least once\nregularly during the observation period. The found regularly\nvisiting Mobile station will be termed as common mobile\nstation. Some information like account balance, service\n\nvalidity and service that subscriber is allowed to access, is\nalways needed to be updated.\nA. Proposed Model Scenario\nLet us consider a Mobile Station user travels 115 km daily.\nHe lives at 'Nellore' and goes to his office at 'Rajampet'\nwhich is 115 km apart from his house. Since he is to drop his\nwife and daughter at 'Podalakur' and 'Rapur' respectively, he\nis to travel same path daily. Now the VLR1 will find that the\nperson leaves this area at 8 am and returns at 8 pm. And the\nVLR2 of MSC service area will find that the person enters this\nservice area at 8.30 am and leaves at 8.40 am daily. Similarly\nwe assume, the possible roaming time in different MSC\nservice area (here in this kadapa area is come MSC1/VLR1 and\nRajampet comes in MSC2/VLR2 area). The same information\nis used for call delivery strategy.\nIn this paper, we are proposing intelligent location\nmanagement scheme for finding the frequently visited mobile\nsubscribers in particular location area, as we said above use\nfuzzy logic, the fuzzy sets within the field of decision making\nhave for the most part consisted for extensions or\n\"fuzzifications\" of the classical theories of decision making.\nClassical decision making generally deals with a set of\nalternatives comprising the decision space, a set of states of\nnature comprising the state space, a relation indicating the\nstate or outcome to be expected from each alternative action.\nB. Decision making of intelligent database VLR using Fuzzy\nLogic\nNow we consider during the 'm' days of observation\nperiod, the number of roaming users is 'N' on all (week)\nworking days respectively in Mobile Switching Center service\narea. Then, the observation set for each day can be considered\nas follows. For example, a mobile subscriber roams from LA1\nto LA2 frequently, intelligent system process the following:\nSubscriber moves from LA1 to LA2, subscriber profile\nreads from HLR and sends to existing VLR for subscriber\nidentity to make a call. The subscriber moves from existing\nLA2 to LA3 and then subscriber record will be deleted\nautomatically and subscriber's identity will be send to LA3.\nSuppose, if Subscriber again visits LA2, subscriber profile\nreads from HLR and is send to VLR for identity, which we are\npresented in scenario model. But, here we have to remember\none thing, that how many times the mobile subscriber visits or\nroams in one particular LA, this is called uncertainty. In this\npaper, we are presenting the fuzzy decision making for\nhandling such uncertainties to retrieve subscribers records\nfrom VLR database. The fuzzy model of decision making is\nproposed by Belleman and Zadesh [1970] [11], which we are\nillustrating by a simple example. Suppose we choose different\nLA and their VLR sets which are mentioned below in mobile\nswitching center:\nFuzzy Set= {(LA1, VLR1), (LA2, VLR2)... (LAn, VLRn)}\nThe characteristics function of a crisp set assigns a value of\neither 1 or 0 to each individual in the universal set, thereby\ndiscriminating members and nonmembers of the crisp set\nunder consideration. This function can be generalized such\nthat the value assigned to the elements of the universal set fall\n\n\fwithin a specific range and indicate the membership grade of\nthese elements in the set in question. Larger values denote\nhigher degree of set membership. Such a function is called a\nmembership function and the set defined by it's a fuzzy set\n[11]. The range of values of membership functions is the unit\ninterval [0, 1]. Here each membership function maps elements\nof a given universal set X, which is always a crisp set, into real\nnumbers in [0,1]\nThe membership function of fuzzy set A is defined by a,\nA:\n\nX [0, 1]\n\nOnce a fuzzy decision has been arrived at, it may be\nnecessary to choose the \"best\" single crisp alternative from\nthis fuzzy set. A fuzzy set may be represented by a meaningful\nfuzzy label. A reasonable expression of these concepts by\ntrapezoidal membership S 1, S2, S3 these functions are defined\non the interval [0, 20]. For example, \"Low_visits\",\n\"Medium_Visits\", \"High_Visits\" are linguistic variable for\nfuzzy set frequently visited locations maintained in mobile\nVLR databases. The linguistic representation is as follows:\n1, No_of_visits \u2264 4\nLow_ Visits\n\n=\n\n-paid( =\n\nSubscriber S2 visited to VLR1 12 times\nSubscribers S3 Visited to VLR1 17 times\nMembership degree for subscriber S1 is 8-5/5 = 3/5 =0.6\nMembership degree of subscriber S2 is 14-12/5= 2/5=0.4\nMembership degree of subscriber S3 is 18-17/5=1/5=0.2\nThe intersection for fuzzy set is\n\u03bcA\u2229B (x) = Min [\u03bcA(x), \u03bcB(x)]\nTherefore, to find the frequently visited subscriber is\n= Min [S1/0.6, S2/0.4, S3/0.2] or Min [0.6, 0.4, 0.2]\n= S3 (0.2)\n= Frequently visited Subscriber is S3\nThis fuzziness allows the decision maker to frame the\ngoals and constraints in vague, linguistic terms; which may\nmore accurately reflect the actual state of knowledge. In this\nmodel, we have shown to stored the linguistic values in fuzzy\nVLR in figure 7.\n\n(8-No_of_visits)/5, 4< No_of_visits < 8\n0,\n\nHLR\n\nNo_of_visits \u2265 8\n(6)\n(3)\n\n0, No_of_visits \u2264 8\nMedium_Visits\n\n=\n\n(No_of_visits-12)/5, 9< No_of_visits < 12\n(14-No_of_visits/5, 12\u2264 No_of_visits < 14\n1,\n\n14 < No_of_visits \u2265 15\n\n0,\n\nNo_of_visits <16\n\n(5)\nVLR\nFuzzy\n\nVLR\n\n(4)\n\nMSC\n\nMSC\n\nHigh_ Visits =\n\nVLR\n\n(2)\n\n(18-No_of_visits)/5, 16\u2264 No_of_visits < 18\n1,\n\nMSC Mobile Switching Center\nHLR Home Location Register\nVLR Visitor Location Register\n\nVLR\nFuzzy\n\n(1)\n\nNo_of_visits \u2265 18\n\nBS\n\nFigure 6: Triangular membership functions for Visits\n\nSuppose, if we assume three mobile subscribers they are\nvisiting and registered at VLR1 database.\nMobile-subscribers set = {(S1, 5), (S2, 12), (S3, 17)} as we\nshown in table 1.\nID\nS1\nS2\nS3\n\nCommon\nVisits\n3,5,6\n2,3,4\n3,4,5\n\nCurrent\nvisits\n5\n12\n17\n\nTable 1: Visitors info in VLR database\n\nIn this above table, if we observe S1 has visited 5 times on\nthe days of 3, 5, and 6 in a 7 day format. That means he/she\nhas visited more than one time in day. The decision making\nscenario using fuzzy logic is, so we can calculate maximum\nnumber of times visited to VLR1 in LA1, the membership\ndegree is:\nSubscriber S1 visited to VLR1 5 times\n\nLA Boundary\n\nBS\n\nFigure 7: Proposed Intelligent Call registration\n\nAs we shown in figure 7 VLR database is divided into two\ntiers one is low-tier and second one is high-tier DBs. They are\nrepresented as V (Traditional VLR) and V1 (Fuzzy VLR).\nWhen the subscribers come into LA, MS functions checks in\nV and V will check at V1, if it found that there is no need to\nsearch the subscriber's profiles from the Home Location\nRegister (HLR). i.e. there are two operations are performed in\nthis system. They are VLR traditional (tier1)\nVLR fuzzy (tier2).\nImmediately VLR fuzzy (tier 2)\nVLR traditional (tier1) transfers the\nold record to VLR. In this scheme, VLR fuzzy is stores the\ninformation if subscribers are frequently visited subscribers in\nthat location area. Record will be deleted after specified period\nautomatically from both the VLRs. In this case, the fuzzy\nconstraints may be defined on the set V and fuzzy goals on the\nset V1 such that\n\u03bcC: V\n\n[0, 1] and \u03bcG: V1\n\n[0, 1]\n\nfunction f can then the defined as a mapping from the ser of\nactions V to the set of outcomes V1 f: V V1 such that a fuzzy\ngoal G defined on set V induces a corresponding fuzzy\n\n\f\u03bcD(x) = Min [\u03bcG(x), \u03bcC(x)]\ngoal G' on the set V, thus \u03bcG'(x) = \u03bcC(x) a fuzzy decision D\nmay them be defined as the choice that satisfies both the goals\nG and the Constraints C. if we interpret this as a logical, we\ncan model it with the intersection of the fuzzy sets G and C\nD= G\u2229C the fuzzy decision D is the specified by the\nmembership function\nC. Algorithm for Intelligent VLR\nThe Location management algorithm makes use of the fact\nthat an average mobile user has limited number of frequently\nvisited locations. Usually a type of activity such as work,\nschool, or shopping, occurring at a particular location. As an\nexample, the shopping locations are located at specific sites,\nand for most users, the work, school, and home locations are\nfixed. We are considering 'm' days of observation period for a\nVLR to find its common mobile station and the searching must\nbe based on IMSI of the visited MS during that time frame. A\npossible algorithm is given below:\nInteger get_common_MS ()\n{\n\nInteger i=0; k=0; m=0;\nInterger array AA[m][];\nAA[m] AA[m] = days_IMSI_copy(1,2,3,4,5,6,7);\nb_day = get_busiest_day_user();\nMax=max1=maximum_user_in_busy_day ();\n// comparing to comparing to get common IMSI;\nfor ( ; i<=max; i is incremented by 1)\n{\nfor (; j<=m; j is incremented by 1)\nfor (;k<max1;k is incremented by 1)\n{\nIf AA[j][k]=b_day[i])\n{ d is incremented by 1\nIf (d==m) copy _IMSI (A[i]);\n}\n}}\nFigure 6: Proposed Intelligent VLR algorithms\n\nD. Algorithm for Intelligent call delivery using fuzzy Logic\nFrequently visited locations of a user are not pre-defined in\nlocation management, since this information is not always\ncollected from mobile subscriber. whenever a subscriber want\nto make a call, profile identification is required to check\nwhether the subscriber identity is verified and accepted by\nHLR or not, but in our proposed system, if subscriber is a\nknown visitor of that particular location, call will be registered\nin VLR and will not be deleted immediately by the VLR\nregister after subscriber moves out of VLR, as we shown in\nfigure 7, the visited records are saved in fuzzy VLR, we will\nfix up time to each and every subscriber for keeping his\nprofiles in VLR database, if they do not visit that location with\nin the specified time, the subscriber record then be deleted\nfrom VLR as well as Fuzzy VLR. Therefore, it is the\nresponsibility of the location management algorithm to\nintelligently determine such information.\n\nThe intelligent algorithm determines these frequently\nvisited locations of a user at a given time of day based on the\nindividual user profile.\nE. Proposed call delivery algorithm\nIn this system, VLR maintains two entries for storing the\ndata as we shown in figure 8. One is for the high-tier database\nis called VLR and another is for the low-tier database is called\nFuzzy VLR for storing fuzzy related values.\nMobile\nsubscriber roams in the same area frequently; it not required in\nretrieving the subscriber record from HLR for identity that\nrecord will be there in fuzzy VLR database up to some period.\nIf the subscriber will not visit same location in specified\nperiod of time record then the record will be deleted\nautomatically. Call delivery setup will have two Databases one\nas HLR and another as VLR, in our proposed system the VLR\ndatabase will be divided into two tier architecture database\nwhich will have High tier database as VLR and Low Tier\ndatabase as VLR Fuzzy. Subscribers make a call data transfer\nin the following way:\nVLR\nVLRFuzzy if subscribers profile is available call will\nbe delivering without asking HLR because subscriber is visits\nthe same location frequently. If subscriber is new for that\nlocation that means VLRfuzzy send signal VLR and VLR ask\nsubscriber profile from HLR. (i.e. VLRfuzzy\nVLR). These\ntwo tier system as we shown in figure 8 for call delivery\nprocess.\n\nHL\nR\n\nMSC Mobile Switching\nCenter\nHLR Home Location\nRegister\nVLR Visitor Location\nRegister\n\n(2)\n(4)\n\n(5)\n\n(3)\n\n(6)\nVLR\nFuzzy\n\nVL\nR\n\nMSC\n\nMSC\n\n(1)\n\nVL\nR\n\nVLR\nFuzzy\n\nCalling MT\n\nCalling MT\n\nBTS\n\nBTS\n\nFigure 8: Proposed Intelligent Call delivery\n\nWe present trapezoidal membership for mobile\nsubscribers, who are visiting frequently on the interval\n[0, 7]. For example, \"Low_visits\", \"Medium_visits\",\n\"High_Visits\" are linguistic variable for fuzzy set frequently\nvisited locations maintained in mobile VLR databases. The\nlinguistic representation is as follows for identify the\nsubscribers are visiting the same location area or not.\nBy using fuzzy relations we tested for 7 days and stored it in\nand as we show the proposed fuzzy VLR database values in\ntable 2. Intelligent call delivery algorithm is derived basing on\nthe values shown in the Table 2.\n\n\fWe developed above algorithms by using Raptor, Raptor is\na simple-to-use problem solving tool that enables the user to\ngenerate executable flowcharts and algorithm.\n\n1, No_of_visits <1\n\n=\n\nLow_ Visits\n\n(No_of_visits-1)/3, 1< No_of_visits \u2264 2\n0, No_of_visits > 2\n\n-paid( =\n\nIV.

It is avoided multiple\nregistrations for call delivery.\n\n\uf0fc\n\nAs we said earlier, fuzzy databases are more flexible\nthan traditional database to querying the data from\nthe databases. Hence, the proposed approaches will\nreduce the retrieval cost also.\n\n\uf0fc\n\nMoreover, Fuzzy databases are support multi key file\nstructures to retrieve the records very fast and\naccurately.\n\nNo_of_visits >5\n\n(7-No_of_visits)/3, 5\u2264 No_of_visits < 6\n\nHigh_ Visits =\n\n1,\n\nNo_of_visits < 6\n\nFigure 9: Triangular membership functions for visits in a week\n\nVisits in a week\nD7\n\nNo.\nof\nVisits\n\nFreq.\nVisits\n\nTime\nExpiry\n\n0\n\n1\n\n1\n\nLow\n\nweek\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\nLow\n\nweek\n\n0\n\n1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n4\n\nMedium\n\nweek\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n16\n\nHigh\n\nweek\n\nMob\nID\n\nD1\n\nD2\n\nD3\n\nD4\n\nD5\n\nD6\n\nS1\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\nS2\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\nS3\n\n1\n\n0\n\n1\n\nS4\n\n1\n\n1\n\n0\n\nTable 2: Subscribers visiting statistics\nCall delivery setup and deletion of subscriber profile at\nVLR database will be depended upon the algorithm given\nthrough Fuzzy. For example S1 Subscriber visits are limited to\n1, S2 Subscriber visits are limited 0, in case of S2 Subscriber\nthe VLR database will delete S2 profile immediately after 7\nDays (we have considered 7 days for observation). Likewise\nsubscriber frequency of visits is defined as Low, Medium and\nHigh as fuzzy linguistic variables.

CONCLUSIONS\nMobile subscriber moves any where in mobile networks,\nand then location registration is need always for making calls.\nIn this study, we noticed how these two databases Home\nLocation Register (HLR) and Visitors Location Register\n(VLR) reflects when subscribers make call. When subscriber\nmakes a call two basic operations are performed. In this paper,\nwe proposed intelligent location management schemes; they\ncan reduce the cost of maintaining location of mobile users by\nusing Fuzzy Logic and Fuzzy databases for call registration\nand call delivery procedure of a mobile station for describing\nlocation and a call setup. We demonstrate the how to store and\nmanage fuzzy data crisp values of which a mobile user\nfrequently visits the location. Our proposed fuzzy based VLR\ncan be well applied to the mobile subscribers that live a well\nregulated life. In the future we will further research improved\non mobility management using fuzzy logic and fuzzy\ndatabases.\nREFERENCES\nWilliam C.Y Lee, Mobile cellular Communications:\nAnalog and Digital systems, McGraw-Hill, Inc., 2nd\nedition, 1995\n[2] Jan Thornier, Intelligent Networks, Artech House, Inc.,\n1994\n[3] C.N Lo, R.S.
