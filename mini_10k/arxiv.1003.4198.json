The formation of massive stars is a highly complex process in which it is unclear whether the star-forming gas is in global\n\ngravitational collapse or an equilibrium state supported by turbulence and/or magnetic fields.\nAims. By studying one of the most massive and dense star-forming regions in the Galaxy at a distance of less than 3 kpc, i.e.\nthe filament containing the well-known sources DR21 and DR21(OH), we attempt to obtain observational evidence to help us to\ndiscriminate between these two views.\nMethods. We use molecular line data from our 13 CO 1\u21920, CS 2\u21921, and N2 H+ 1\u21920 survey of the Cygnus X region obtained with\nthe FCRAO and CO, CS, HCO+ , N2 H+ , and H2 CO data obtained with the IRAM 30m telescope.\nResults. We observe a complex velocity field and velocity dispersion in the DR21 filament in which regions of the highest columndensity, i.e., dense cores, have a lower velocity dispersion than the surrounding gas and velocity gradients that are not (only) due to\nrotation. Infall signatures in optically thick line profiles of HCO+ and 12 CO are observed along and across the whole DR21 filament.\nBy modelling the observed spectra, we obtain a typical infall speed of \u223c0.6 km s\u22121 and mass accretion rates of the order of a few\n10\u22123 M yr\u22121 for the two main clumps constituting the filament. These massive clumps (4900 and 3300 M at densities of around\n105 cm\u22123 within 1 pc diameter) are both gravitationally contracting. The more massive of the clumps, DR21(OH), is connected to a\nsub-filament, apparently 'falling' onto the clump. This filament runs parallel to the magnetic field.\nConclusions. All observed kinematic features in the DR21 filament (velocity field, velocity dispersion, and infall), its filamentary\nmorphology, and the existence of (a) sub-filament(s) can be explained if the DR21 filament was formed by the convergence of flows\non large scales and is now in a state of global gravitational collapse. Whether this convergence of flows originated from self-gravity on\nlarger scales or from other processes cannot be determined by the present study. The observed velocity field and velocity dispersion are\nconsistent with results from (magneto)-hydrodynamic simulations where the cores lie at the stagnation points of convergent turbulent\nflows.\nKey words. interstellar medium: clouds \u2013 individual objects: Cygnus X \u2013 molecules \u2013 kinematics and dynamics \u2013 Radio lines: ISM\n\n1. Introduction\nOur goal in this series of papers is to investigate the generic link\nbetween the large-scale (several 10 pc) molecular-cloud spatial\nstructure (Schneider et al. 2010), medium-scale (<10 pc) dynamic fragment properties (this paper), and the occurrence of\nhigh-mass star formation on small (0.1-0.5 pc) scales (Bontemps\net al. 2010, Csengeri et al. 2010). To achieve this, we make use\nof our multiwavelength study in Cygnus X (see below). This region has already been shown to represent an excellent laboratory\nfor studies of high-mass star formation.\nMolecular clouds (MCs) are the birthplaces of low- and highmass stars. Understanding their formation and evolution is essential to understanding in general the star formation (SF) process. There are currently two different scenarios for the evolution\nof MCs and stars, a dynamic and a quasi-static view.\nIn the dynamic context, MCs are transient, rapidly evolving\nentities that are not in equilibrium, and the spatial and velocity\nstructure of the cloud is determined by compressible supersonic\nturbulence (see e.g., Mac Low & Klessen 2004 for an overview).\nSend offprint requests to: N. Schneider\nCorrespondence to: nschneid@cea.fr\n\nThe driving sources of turbulence can be diverse and their relative importance remains a subject of debate. Large-scale mechanisms such as supernovae explosions, should be the most importantXS, based on theoretical arguments extensively discussed by\nMacLow & Klessen (2004).\nTurbulence may also occur during the formation process of\nmolecular clouds (Vazquez-Semandeni et al. 2002, Klessen &\nHennebelle 2010) within large-scale colliding flows of mostly\natomic gas in the galactic disk, generated by dynamic compression in the interstellar medium or other large-scale instabilities\n(see, e.g., Hennebelle & Audit 2007, Vazquez-Semadeni et al.\n2008, Hennebelle et al. 2008, Banerjee et al. 2009). High velocity compressive flows form dense structures at stagnation points\nthat may collapse to form stars/clusters (Ballesteros-Paredes et\nal. 2003, Vazquez-Semadeni et al. 2007, 2009, Heitsch et al.\n2008). In this case, the velocity field and velocity dispersion\nof molecular clumps may contain the signature of the external\nconvergent motion and the compressive, gravitational contraction (this was already proposed by Goldreich & Kwan 1974).\nThe star-forming core is then the dense post-shock region with\na more quiescent velocity dispersion than the turbulent flow\n(Klessen et al. 2005). This scenario is valid for both, low-\n\n\f2\n\nN. Schneider et al.: DR21 filament\n\nand high-mass star formation. However, there is no direct observational confirmation of the existence of convergent flows.\nStudying the dynamics of HI and molecular gas may be a possibility (Brunt 2003), though it is not clear what observational signatures are to be expected. An indirect argument for molecular\ncloud formation out of colliding HI flows was provided by Audit\n& Hennebelle (2009), who showed that their models closely reproduce the observed clump mass spectra and Larson-relations.\nIt has also been noted that the lifetime of the cloud in the gravoturbulent framework is short (one dynamical crossing time, i.e.\n\u223c107 yr for giant molecular clouds) and the star formation process is rapid.\nIn the quasi-static view (see McKee & Ostriker 2007 and references therein), MCs are formed by large-scale self-gravitating\ninstabilities such as spiral density waves. (High-mass) star formation is approached in the 'turbulent core' model (McKee &\nTan 2003) in which the star-forming cores are supersonically\nturbulent. Turbulent magnetic and thermal pressure supports the\nclump against self-gravity. Because of energy injection from\nnewly formed stars, the clumps and most of the cores may maintain their equilibrium, unless they quasistatically evolve to a\ngravitationally unstable state to finally form stars (if the magnetic flux diffuses out of the clump by ambipolar diffusion). In\nthe case of low-mass stars, the collapse of a rotating cloud of\ngas and dust leads to the formation of an accretion disk through\nwhich matter is channeled onto a central protostar. For stars with\nmasses higher than about 8 M this mechanism of star formation is less clear due to the strong radiation field that pushes\nagainst infalling material and may halt accretion. However, theoretical work (Yorke & Sonnhalter 2002; Krumholz, McKee,\nKlein 2005; Peters et al. 2010) has shown that outflows lead to\nanisotropy in the stellar radiation field, which reduce the radiation effects experienced by gas in the infalling envelope. Thus,\nmassive stars may therefore be able to form by a mechanism\nsimilar to that by which low mass stars form. Peters et al. (2010)\neven show that clustered SF is a natural outcome of massive SF\neven in the presence of radiative feedback. However, clustered\nSF is also a natural result of the competitive accretion scenario\n(Bonnell & Bate 2006), in which the fragmentation of a turbulent cloud produces stars with masses of the order of the Jeans\nmass within a common gravitational potential. These stars, located close to the centre of the potential, accrete at much higher\nrates than isolated stars and become massive.\nBoth scenarios have in common that massive (>10 M ) stars\nform only from the coldest, and densest, cores (size scale <0.1\npc) of molecular clouds and that high infall/accretion rates are\nrequired to overcome feedback processes (ionizing radiation,\njets, outflows). In the dynamic framework, stars form as the dynamical evolution of the MC progresses with gas continuously\nbeing accreted. Individual clumps (\u223c0.1\u20130.5 pc) fragment into\nhundreds of protostars, possibly competing for mass in the central regions of the cluster (Bonnell & Bate 2006). Support from\nmagnetic fields (Hennebelle & Teyssier 2008) and/or radiation\n(Krumholz 2006, Bate 2009) could drastically limit the level of\nfragmentation and channel the global infall to fewer, more massive protostars (Bontemps et al. 2010).\nFrom the observational point of view, indications of global\ncollapse have been detected using molecular lines. Spectral profiles of high density tracers, usually combining at least an optically thin and an optically thick line, are good probes of infalling gas (e.g. Myers et al. 1996). Observations in low-mass\nstar-forming regions (e.g. Lee et al. 2003) contain a mixture of\ninfall (blue-shifted emission and/or redshifted self-absorption in\nthe optically thick line) and outflow asymmetry. This sort of line\n\nprofile was also found in the high-mass star-forming region W43\n(Motte et al. 2003). Peretto et al. (2006) proposed that a peculiar velocity discontinuity could be the result of some large-scale\nmotion, originating from self-gravity (Peretto et al. 2007). The\ntheory of turbulent core formation, on the other hand, predicts\nthe existence of massive pre-stellar cores that have not been detected so far, not even in sensitive and extensive dust continuum\nstudies (e.g. Motte et al. 2007).\nIn this paper, we shortly introduce the Cygnus X region and\nthe DR21 filament in Sect. 2 and describe the molecular line\noberservations in Sect. 3 and show maps and spectra in Sect. 4.\nSection 5 presents an analysis of the kinematic structure and the\nphysical properties of the DR21 filament and in Sect. 6 we use\nour findings to test the conditions of the different high-mass star\nformation and turbulence models.

It contains a prominent OB-association, Cyg\nOB2, with \u223c100 O-stars and a total stellar mass of up to 105\nM (Kn\u00f6dlseder 2000). From large-scale 13 CO 2\u21921 (KOSMA1 ,\nSchneider et al. 2006) and 13 CO 1\u21920 (FCRAO2 , Schneider et\nal. 2007, Simon et al., in prep.) surveys, we obtained a mass of\na few 106 M for the whole molecular cloud complex that is divided into two parts \u2013 Cygnus North and South. These studies\nalso showed that the majority of molecular clouds is located at a\ncommon distance of about 1.7 kpc, i.e. the distance of Cyg OB2.\nIts proximity makes Cygnus X one of the rare laboratories\nwhere different phases of massive star formation can be studied\nin detail.

Zeroth moment map of CS 2\u21921 emission (red contours, mapping area indicated by a continuous blue line) in Cygnus X\noverlaid on a moment map of 13 CO 1\u21920 emission (mapping area indicated by a dashed line). Both maps were obtained with the\nFCRAO and have an angular resolution of \u223c5000 . Emission was integrated in the velocity range \u201310 to 20 km s\u22121 and the grey scaling\nranges from 1 to 15 K km s\u22121 . Red contour levels for CS are at 0.5,1,2,4 K km s\u22121 . The DR21 filament is indicated, as well as some\nprominent objects in Cygnus X (S106, AFGL2591, W75N, the most massive stars of the OB2 cluster).\nWolf-Rayet stars, several OB associations, and at least one\nstar of spectral type O4If are known in Cygnus X, reflecting\nits record of high-mass star formation in the past. Ongoing\nmassive star formation is revealed by wide-field (3 deg2 ) 1.2\nmm continuum imaging of the densest regions in the Cygnus\nX molecular clouds (Motte et al. 2007). More than 100 protostellar dense-cores were detected of which 40 are likely to be\nthe precursors of massive OB stars. High-angular resolution\nobservations with the Plateau de Bure Interferometer (Bontemps\net al. 2010) have indeed confirmed that the most massive dense\ncores of this sample are the sites of massive star formation,\nmainly in the form of clusters.\nThe DR21 filament\nFrom our 1.2 mm continuum imaging and the 13 CO surveys, we concluded that the molecular ridge containing DR21\n\nand DR21(OH) (Dickel, Dickel & Wilson 1978, Wilson &\nMauersberger 1990, Jakob et al. 2007) is the most active, dense\n(average density\u223c104 cm\u22123 ), and massive (34 000 M ) cloud in\nCygnus X.\nDR21 (Downes & Rinehart 1966) itself is a group of several compact HII regions (Harris et al. 1973) with an associated,\nvery energetic outflow (e.g. Garden et al. 1991a, Russell et al.\n1992), located in the southern part of the ridge. Three arcminutes further north lies DR21(OH), famous for its maser emission (H2 O, Genzel & Downes 1977; OH, Norris et al. 1982;\nCH3 OH, Batrla & Menten 1988). Even further north lies the\nmassive star-forming region W75N (see Shepherd et al. 2004 for\na review). Very recently, the DR21 filament was again the target\nfor a wealth of studies in various wavelengths. Infrared images\nat 3.6, 4.5, and 8 \u03bcm from the Spitzer satellite (Marston et al.\n2004, Hora et al. 2009) show the complexity of the region with\n\n\f4\n\nN. Schneider et al.: DR21 filament\n\nFig. 2. Zeroth moment maps of CS 2\u21921 (left, contour levels are 0.5, 1, 2, 4 K km s\u22121 ) and N2 H+ 1\u21920 (right, contour levels are\n0.5, 1.5, 3 K km s\u22121 ) emission in Cygnus X North in the velocity range \u201310 to 20 km s\u22121 observed with the FCRAO. Thermal\nHII regions (DR17\u201323) are indicated by red stars, mm-continuum sources from Motte et al. (2007) by green triangles. The latter\ncorrespond very well with peaks of N2 H+ emission.\nmany IR-filaments perpendicular to the ridge that seem to be\nsites of star formation (Kumar et al. 2007). Dust continuum studies (Vall\u00e9e & Fiege 2006, Motte et al. 2007) confirmed the detection of 8 compact, dense cores in the DR21 filament (Chandler et\nal. 1993) and found additional ones. Some of them are high mass\nprotostars and drive outflows detected in SiO (Motte et al. 2007).\nAn H2 1-0 S(1) image at 2.121 \u03bcm (Davis et al. 2007) shows at\nleast 50 individual outflows driven by embedded low-mass stars.\nWe studied this particular filament in high-angular resolution observations with the IRAM3 30 m telescope in different\nmolecular tracers (isotopomeric CO lines, CS, C34 S, HCO+ ,\nH13 CO+ , N2 H+ , H2 CO) to investigate the distribution of the\ndifferent phases of molecular gas (cold dense cores, warm envelopes) and to uncover infall/outflow signatures. The lower angular resolution FCRAO data delineate the large-scale structure\nin which the DR21 filament is embedded. A more detailed analysis of the FCRAO 13 CO data set is presented in Schneider et\nal. (2007, 2010) and the CS and N2 H+ data will be discussed in\na forthcoming paper. All molecular line data we obtained serve\nas a basis for a physical model of the DR21 filament, including\ndetailed non-LTE line modelling.\n\n3. Observations\n3.1. FCRAO\n\nWe used data from a molecular line survey (13 CO and C18 O\nJ=1\u21920, CS J=2\u21921, and N2 H+ J=1\u21920) of the entire Cygnus X\nregion (Simon et al., in prep., Schneider et al. 2007) taken with\n3\n\nInstitut de Radio-Astronomie Millimetrique\n\nthe FCRAO 14m telescope. The data were obtained between\n2003 December and 2006 January using the 32 pixel 'Second\nQuabbin Optical Imaging Array' (SEQUOIA) in an On-the-Fly\n(OTF) observing mode. In this paper, we employ 13 CO 1\u21920,\nCS 2\u21921, and N2 H+ 1\u21920 data that cover an area of 35 square\ndegrees in 13 CO and 12 square degrees in CS/N2 H+ on a 2200 .5\ngrid. The beamwidth of the FCRAO at 93 (110) GHz is 4500 (4800 )\nand the dual channel correlator was configured to obtain a velocity resolution of \u223c0.1 km s\u22121 . The spectra have a mean 1 \u03c3 rms\nnoise level of \u223c0.2 K on a T\u2217A antenna temperature scale, i.e.,\nnot corrected for the main beam efficiency of \u223c0.48. Pointing\nand calibration were checked regularly at the start of the Cygnus\nobserving interval and after transit (no observations were performed at elevations higher than 75\u25e6 ). Pointing sources were SiO\nmasers of evolved stars, i.e., \u03c7-Cyg, R-Leo and T-Cep, depending on LST-time. The calibration was checked regularly on the\nposition of peak emission in DR21 and found to be consistent to\nwithin 10%.\n3.2. IRAM\n\nAll molecular line maps4 obtained with the IRAM 30m telescope in the Sierra Nevada/Spain were performed in June 2007.\nTable 1 gives an overview of all lines and observational parameters. In order to efficiently map an area of \u223c40 \u00d7100 , covering\nthe whole DR21 filament, we observed in the 'on-the-fly' mapping mode. The total area was divided into 7 sub-maps that were\nscanned horizontally. For strong lines (e.g. CO, HCO+ ), only\n4\n\nThe IRAM data are available on request, contact nschneid@cea.fr.\n\n\fN.

Channel maps of 13 CO 1\u21920 emission in Cygnus X North in the velocity range \u20133.2 to \u20130.9 km s\u22121 observed with the FCRAO.\nThe red triangle shows the position of DR21(OH). The three major subfilaments (F1, F2, F3) linked with the large DR21 filament\nare indicated in the plot of velocity \u20132.6 km s\u22121 .\none or two coverages were required while weaker lines were observed more often or with two receivers at once to obtain a sufficient signal-to-noise ratio. The resulting regridded (500 ) maps\nshow slight smearing effects and fluctuations in the intensity calibration only in the lines of 12 CO and H2 CO. The center position of all maps is within 300 of the MM2-position given in\nMangum, Wooten, and Mundy (1991): RA(2000)=20h 39m 00 s\nand DEC(2000)=42\u25e6 220 4400 . As OFF-position, we used a position with offset 000 ,180000 from DR21(OH) where 12 CO 2\u21921\nemission of around 1 K is observed at velocities around \u201342 km\ns\u22121 , separated well from the bulk emission of the DR21 filament.\nAll data were reduced using GILDAS5 .\nThe spectral lines were recorded simultaneously in uniform,\ngood weather conditions (average atmospheric opacity of 0.2 at\n230 GHz) prevailing over several days. We used the IRAM facility receivers and autocorrelator, which were adapted in terms of\nspectral resolution and bandwidth such that all lines have a similar velocity resolution between 0.03 and 0.05 km s\u22121 . Pointing\nand focus were checked every 2 hours. The pointing accuracy\nwas found to be better than 400 and the receivers were aligned to\nwithin 200 .\n\n4. Results\n4.1. The DR21 filament as part of a complex network\n\nFigure 1 shows the zeroth moment map of line integrated (\u201310\nto 20 km s\u22121 ) CS 2\u21921 emission obtained with the FCRAO overlaid on a grey scale map of 13 CO 1\u21920 emission. The moment\n5\n\nhttp:iram.fr/IRAMFR/GILDAS\n\nmaps were constructed following the masked moment procedure\ndescribed in Adler et al. (1992). For CS and N2 H+ , we used\na temperature threshold of 0.1 K, for 13 CO a threshold of 0.2\nK. For the CS mapping, we focussed on the high column density regions seen in 13 CO. We adopt the nomenclature 'CygnusX North, South, and Northwest', established in Schneider et al.\n(2006) for the different cloud regions.\nThe CS emission is more compact than that of 13 CO and\nclearly delineates the high density regions. Interestingly, regions\nof peak emission in 13 CO do not always show up in CS. This\nindicates that, though the column density is high, the average\ndensity in these regions may stay below the critical density (ncr )\nof the CS line (a few 105 cm\u22123 ). Abundance variations caused\nby chemical effects probably also play a role. While in Cygnus\nNorth, and partly in its north-west region, CS clumps form a\nconnected network of filamenatry structures, the emission distribution in Cygnus South is more dispersed with more isolated CS\nclumps.\nIn the following, we concentrate on a discussion of the filaments in Cygnus-North. For that, we display in Fig. 2 maps\nof CS 2\u21921 and N2 H+ 1\u21920 emission where the 'organization'\nof clumps along filaments is clearly visible. Even the N2 H+\nmap \u2013 which traces only dense (ncr =0.5\u201370\u00d7106 cm\u22123 ) and cold\ngas (e.g. Tafalla et al. 2002) \u2013 shows the same arrangement of\nclumps. Most prominent in all maps is the filament containing\nthe HII region DR21 (see below). The moment maps (Fig. 2)\nshow that all evolved star formation sites in Cygnus North (indicated by the HII regions DR17 to DR23) as well as future starforming sites (indicated by the mm-continuum sources tracing\nmassive dense cores, Motte et al. 2007) lie on filamentary structures.\n\n\f6\n\nN. Schneider et al.: DR21 filament\n\n4.2. The DR21 filament\n\nFrom the large-scale, medium-angular-resolution (\u223c10 ) molecular line maps (Sect. 4.1) and previous studies (Sect. 1), the\nDR21 filament clearly appears to be the most prominent starforming region in Cygnus X. The DR21 region in the south contains a very powerful, evolved outflow, while further north, the\nDR21(OH) region contains maser sources, indicative of recent\nstar-formation activities. The mm-contiuum survey of Motte et\nal. (2007) revealed more than 20 protostellar objects, i.e. sites of\nstar formation. The filament is shown in more detail in channel maps of 13 CO 1\u21920 emission (Fig. 3), obtained with the\nFCRAO. It reveals the characteristic N-S oriented ridge known\nfrom other molecular line and continuum surveys (Dickel et al.\n1978, Wilson & Mauersberger 1990, Vall\u00e9e & Fiege 2006, Motte\net al. 2007, Jakob et al. 2007). What is special in these channel maps is the appearance of several E-W oriented subfilaments\n(indicated as F1\u2013F3 at v=\u20132.6 km s\u22121 ) that are connected to the\nmain DR21 filament and extend over several velocity channels.\nThe most prominent one (F3) has a length of around 100 (5 pc)\nand is also visible in the CS map (Fig.2) and in mm-continuum\n(Motte et al. 2007), indicating that gas of high density is present.\n\nFig. 4. Positionally averaged (across the whole observing region\nfor each line) spectra of all lines observed in the DR21 filament\nusing the IRAM 30m telesope. The HCO+ line is multiplied by\na factor 8.5, the C34 S and H13 CO+ lines by 10.\n\n4.2.1. Average spectra\n\nTo study in more detail the physical properties (mass, density,\ntemperature) and kinematics (infall and outflow signatures, velocity gradient) of the filament, we mapped the central part of\nthe filament containing DR21 and DR21(OH) in various molecular line tracers at an angular resolution of between 1200 and 3000\nusing the IRAM 30m telescope.\nTo distinguish the different emission features of the filament,\nwe produced positionally averaged spectra of five of the observed lines (Fig. 4). The averaging was performed across each\nmap extent, i.e. covering the whole filament. The CO lines exhibit two velocity components, one centered on \u20133 km s\u22121 and\none on +9 km s\u22121 . They correspond to the molecular clouds associated with DR21 and W75N, respectively (see also Dickel et\nal. 1978). Though the W75N region itself is not included in the\nmapping region, molecular gas related to this star-forming region northwest of the DR21 filament (see Fig. 2) is still present\nacross the filament. However, the gas is more diffuse and of\n\nlower density since a line at +9 km s\u22121 (Fig. 4) can only be seen\nin the low-density tracers (12 CO and 13 CO). The HCO+ line reveals a narrow absorption feature at +9 km s\u22121 (seen also by\nNyman 1983), while the optically thin lines show no significant\nemission for the W75N component.\nThe bulk emission of the DR21 filament is found at \u20133 km\ns\u22121 (single Gaussian lines in C34 S, H13 CO+ , and 13 CO). The optically thick lines of 12 CO and HCO+ show prominent, extended\nblue and red wing emission. The red wing, however, is blended\nwith the W75N component, seen in emission in 12 CO and absorption in HCO+ . The wings are caused by the powerful outflow\nof DR21 (Garden et al. 1991a) but also other outflow sources discussed in Sect. 4.3. The self-absorption feature at \u20133 km s\u22121 is\nseen in the optically thick lines of 12 CO and HCO+ , while optically thin lines peak at the velocity of the absorption dip. This\nmay be a signature of inflowing gas and is discussed in more\ndetail in Sect. 5.2.\n4.2.2. The DR21 filament in velocity-integrated maps\n\nBased on the average spectrum (Fig. 4) we produced line integrated maps of the bulk emission of the DR21 cloud (Fig. 5).\nThough there are differences in the detailed emission distribution, one can separate three main regions: a southern cloud with\nDR21, a middle emission peak with DR21(OH), and a northern\nextension with two secondary peaks.\nWhile DR21 is most prominent in the HCO+ and 13 CO lines,\nDR21(OH) is more pronounced in all optically thin lines. A\nsmall shift in the position of peak emission of DR21(OH) can\nbe discerned by comparing C34 S/H13 CO+ and N2 H+ . For N2 H+ ,\nwe determined the optical depth using the hyperfine structure\npattern of this line and found that \u03c4 remains below 1 basically\neverywhere in the map. The latter traces cold, dense gas that is\nlocated more south of the warmer central part of the DR21(OH)\nregion. Mauersberger et al. (1986) report a temperature above\n200 K in a small region of size <900 in DR21(OH), and Wilson\n& Mauersberger (1990) determine a rotation temperature of 34\nK from NH3 observations. Mangum et al. (1991,1992) interpreted their observations as a detection of a B-star within the\nDR21(OH) clump. The northern part of the filament is more\nprominent in N2 H+ and H13 CO+ emission and not in C34 S.\nWilson & Mauersberger (1990), and Wienen (2008) derive values around 20 K for this region.\nFigure 6 is a position-velocity cut in 12 CO and 13 CO 2\u21921\nand HCO+ 1\u21920 along the filament in which all data points in RA\nwere averaged. The greyscale image of 12 CO emission shows\nthat the bulk emission of the DR21 filament at \u20133 km s\u22121 and the\nbulk emission of the W75N component at 9 km s\u22121 are apparently connected. The gas linking the two components has a low\ncolumn density since it is only visible in 12 CO and not in 13 CO\n(red contours). A lack of 12 CO emission exists between \u2206\u03b4=000\nand \u201315000 at \u223c8 km s\u22121 , indicating that the (cooler) W75N cloud\nlies in front of the DR21 filament and causes the 12 CO selfabsorption. Dickel et al. (1978) and Bieging et al. (1982) came\nto the same conclusion following their detection of self-absorbed\nline profiles in H2 CO and OH toward DR21. However, the situation is slightly more complicated because the W75N line component is blended in its southern part (<000 ) with emission from the\n'Great Cygnus rift', which is basically not seen in 13 CO emission (Schneider et al. 2007). The rift is an extended, low-density\ngas cloud at a distance of around 600 pc. Its emission can start\nas low as +4 km s\u22121 and makes it thus difficult to disentangle the\ndifferent emission features. It is, however, possible that there is a\nreal physical connection/interaction between the DR21 filament\n\n\fN. Schneider et al.: DR21 filament\n\n7\n\nFig. 5.

The HCO+ 1\u21920 and 13 CO 2\u21921 lines are integrated over a\nvelocity range from \u201311 to 5 km s\u22121 , the H2 CO 3(1,2)\u21922(1,1) line from \u201311 to 2 km s\u22121 , and all other lines from \u20137 to 1 km s\u22121 .\nContour levels follow the notation start/end/step with 15\u03c3=3.8/87.3/7.5 K km s\u22121 (HCO+ ), 6\u03c3=1.3/10.9/3.9 K km s\u22121 (H13 CO+ ),\n30\u03c3=34.1/249.4/23.9 K km s\u22121 (13 CO), 6\u03c3=5.9/14.7/2.9 K km s\u22121 (C34 S), 9\u03c3=6.4/49.1/10.7 K km s\u22121 (H2 CO), 3\u03c3=0.27/1.9/0.27\nK km s\u22121 (N2 H+ ).

They\nsuggested that the 'W75N' cloud is differentially slowed down\nas it passes the edge of the DR21 cloud due to the observed N-S\noriented velocity gradient from +11 km s\u22121 to +9 km s\u22121 (which\nis clearly seen in our CO data as well).\n\nSeveral outflows are identified out of which the DR21 outflow at \u2206\u03b4=\u201320000 is the most pronounced. However, its red flow\nis not clearly defined because (i) it is blended with the 'Great\nRift' emission and (ii) because it runs into an HII region (Garden\net al. 1992).

The red triangles\nindicate the positions of DR21(OH)(north) and DR21 (south), respectively.\n'flow-features' are identified at \u2206\u03b4=000 (DR21OH(M)) and at\n\u223c18000 , both look well-defined at negative velocities and disturbed for positive velocities. The position-velocity diagram for\nHCO+ shows that these outflows are much less obvious than that\ntowards DR21. We come back to outflows in Sect. 4.3 and in\nparticular the one seen at DR21OH(M) in Sects. 4.2.3 and 5.2.\n\nat the DR21(OH) clump while H13 CO+ emits more strongly in\nthe northern part of the filament.\n\nAnother feature visible in Fig. 6 is a region of self-absorption\nin 12 CO (emission regions in 13 CO) at around \u20133 km s\u22121 along\nthe whole filament (indicated by a dashed white line). This central region of self-absorption is even more clearly identified in\nthe HCO+ map. The strongest self-absorption is found at the\ndeclination offsets of DR21 and DR21OH(M). We discuss this\nfinding in more detail in Sect. 5.2.\n\n4.2.3.

The distribution of bulk emission of\nthe cloud between \u20132 and \u20135 km s\u22121 is similar in both tracers and\nfollows the typical NS-ridge of the DR21 filament. Some emission peaks are stronger in H13 CO+ than in C34 S (and vice versa)\ndue to the different density and temperature regimes. An example is seen at velocity \u20134 km s\u22121 where C34 S peaks prominently\n\nFig. 8.

The different emission components are indicated with short dashed lines.\nAt velocities larger than \u20132 km s\u22121 , we identify an extended\nemission component between \u20131 and 0.5 km s\u22121 that appears\n\n\fN. Schneider et al.: DR21 filament\n\n9\n\nprominent in H13 CO+ (and N2 H+ not shown here) but not in\nC34 S (and H2 CO also not shown here) northwest of DR21(OH).\nIn 12 CO and 13 CO 2\u21921, this feature is discernible as well,\nbut largely blended with other emission components. This subfilament is the eastern end of the large-scale filament F3 that was\nobserved in lower-angular resolution 13 CO 1\u21920 channel maps\n(Fig. 3). It was also seen in isotopomeric CO 3\u21922 data (Vall\u00e9e\n& Fiege 2006) and interpreted by the authors as being caused\nby outflow emission from DR21OH(M). An outflow is indeed\ndetected at this position (see Sect. 4.3) but the emission in the\nvelocity range \u223c\u20131 to 1 km s\u22121 is clearly due to an individual\ncloud fragment. Spectra towards a position within this fragment\nare shown in Fig. 8. An individual Gaussian line is seen at 0\nkm s\u22121 for all optically thin lines (at this position rather close to\nDR21OH(M) also for C34 S). It becomes obvious that the 12 CO\n2\u21921 line \u2013 even at an angular resolution of 1100 \u2013 is not useful\nfor separating individual components since it is too sensitive to\nlow-density emission. Figure 9 superimposes N2 H+ and H13 CO+\nemission in the two major velocity ranges, the bulk emission\nbetween \u20136 to \u20133 km s\u22121 in grey scale and the fragment emission between \u20131 and 1 km s\u22121 as overlaying contours. The emission in H13 CO+ for both velocity ranges peaks at the position of\nDR21OH-(M). A secondary weaker peak is found \u223c5000 further\nsouth, close to N48 (or DR21OH-(S))6 , where N2 H+ between \u20136\nand \u20133 km s\u22121 has its peak emission. This supports the 'hot core'\nscenario for DR21-OH(M) because the gas there is warmer and\nchemically richer than in the dense, cold core of DR21OH-(S).\nThis core, however, is embedded in a warmer envelope traced by\nH13 CO+ . Even more interesting is the 0 km s\u22121 component. The\nemission distribution in H13 CO+ and N2 H+ suggests that this\nfragment 'falls' on the densest part of the DR21OH(M) clump.\nThe N2 H+ peak is more distinct and smaller in extent and shifted\nwith respect to H13 CO+ , again indicating that H13 CO+ emission\narises from the warm envelope.\n4.3. Ouflows\n\nFigure 10 shows in more detail the outflow features detected in\nFig. 6. From the position-velocity plot and positionally averaged\n12\nCO spectra, we can clearly define the blue emission range between \u201330 and \u201317 km s\u22121 . The redshifted emission is more difficult to discern because at higher positive velocities, a part of the\nline emission in the southern part of the DR21 filament is due to\nthe 'Great Cygnus rift' (see Sect. 4.2.2). However, the velocity\nrange \u223c17 to \u223c30 km s\u22121 characterizes well the red wing.\nSeveral blue outflow sources are clearly recognized. These\nare all associated with mm-continuum sources, i.e. N53, N44,\nand N45. Source N51 shows broad line wings in 12 CO and\nHCO+ (Fig. 14), which is most likely only the south extention of\nthe N53 outflow. Southeast of N44 and at offsets \u201310000 ,\u201314000\nare clearly defined blue sources that have no red counterparts.\nSources N53, N48, and N44 show outflow emission in SiO 2\u21921\n(Motte et al. 2007) with a prominent red wing for N53 and a blue\nwing for N44. They are classified as massive infrared-quiet protostellar cores (Motte et al. 2007) with masses of 85, 197, and\n446 M , respectively. N45 exhibits no SiO emission but is associated with an H2 jet (source A 3-1 in Davis et al. 2007), which is\nprobably driven by a low- or intermediate-mass YSO (all H2 -jets\nare marked with crosses in the plot). N44 is the known outflow of\n6\nIn this paper, we follow the notation of mm-continuum clumps\ngiven in Motte et al. 2007. This source list is more complete than the\none from Chandler et al. 1993. However, for clarity, we still give the\nformer names DR21OH(Main, South, West) on occasion.\n\nFig. 9.

However, no H2\nemission was detected (Davis et al. 2007).\nThis source is well studied (e.g. Garden et al. 1991a, 1991b,\n1992), so we do not go into details here. In our map, we see also\nthe classical east-west orientation of the flow with some northsouth features (e.g. component 'C' in Garden et al.). Among the\nother sources, only N53 and N44 show red wing emission. It is\nnot clear what the emission feature running east-west at offsets\n\u20136000 in declination is.

Analysis\nThis section is devoted to an analysis of the physical properties of the DR21 filament. We, however, exclude the area around\nDR21 since this region is perturbed by outflow emission and line\nconfusion. We focus instead on the northern part of the DR21 filament, including the region of DR21(OH).\n\nFig. 11. Greyscale map of line integrated N2 H+ 1\u21920 emission\nof the DR21 filament with spectra of HCO+ overlaid in red.\nThe spectra cover a velocity range of \u201310 to 10 km s\u22121 and a\ntemperature range of \u20131 to 12 K. Green triangles indicate mmcontinuum sources from Motte et al. (2007) and are named accordingly. N44, N38, and N48 coincide with the mm-sources\nDR21OH-M(Main),W(West), and S(South), respectively, named\nby Chandler et al. (1993). The 000 ,000 position is DR21OH(M)\n(see Sect. 3). Spectra of the sources in bold (N53, N51, and N48)\nare displayed in Fig. 14.\n\n5.1. Physical properties of the sub-filaments\n\nOur molecular line observations show that the DR21 filament\nis connected to several sub-filaments seen on large and small\nscales. In the 13 CO 1\u21920 channel maps (Fig. 3), it becomes obvious that the most prominent filament F3 covers a velocity range\nof \u223c3 km s\u22121 (between \u20134 km s\u22121 and \u20131 km s\u22121 ) and has a projected length of \u223c7 pc (the width is \u223c1.5 pc). The channel maps\nshow that the top of the column lies at higher velocities, indicating that this part of the filament is tilted away from the observer. Assuming an average angle to the line-of-sight of 57.3\u25e6\n(in the case of a random distribution of orientation angles, the\naverage angle is equal to this value), this implies a dynamic lifetime of \u223c1.5\u00d7106 yr. The mass of the filament (for more details see Appendix A about the mass determination from 13 CO\n\ndata) is 2600 M and the average density is 690 cm\u22123 . This subfilament indeed corresponds to 'clump 7' in the DR21 region,\nidentified in the 13 CO 2\u21921 survey by Schneider et al. (2006).\nThe higher angular resolution IRAM observations resolve\nthe detailed structure and show how this sub-filament connects\nto the DR21(OH) clump within the filament (see Sect. 4.2.3).\nThe mass, determined from the line integrated H13 CO+ intensity (see Appendix A), is 1320 M with an average density of\n8.1\u00d7104 cm\u22123 . This mass estimate, however, is rather uncertain\nbecause of the uncertain [HCO+ ]/[H2 ] abundance ratio. From the\nchannel maps (Fig. 7), we see that the filament extends up to \u223c\n0.5 km s\u22121 and therefore has a total radial velocity range of 4.5\n\n\fN. Schneider et al.: DR21 filament\n\n11\n\nFig. 12. The grey area, divided by the total line-integrated intensity over all velocities (the 'normalized line intensity'), is shown\nin Fig. 13. Note that only spectra with a real infall line profile\n(T(blue)>T(red)) were considered.\n\nFig. 14. Spectra of optically thick (12 CO 2\u21921 and HCO+ 1\u21920)\nand thin (N2 H+ 1\u21920, C34 S 2\u21921,and H13 CO+ ) spectra from selected positions in the DR21 filament. The 12 CO intensity was\nreduced by a factor of 4. To avoid confusion, the lower frequency\nHFS components of the N2 H+ line were suppressed.\n\nFig. 13.

The rectangle indicates the zoom region\ndisplayed in Fig. 9.\n\nlarge and small scales. Assuming a constant velocity of 4.5 km\ns\u22121 (the largest observed range of velocity) along the whole F3\nsub-filament, the angle of the sub-filament to the line-of-sight\nwould be 48\u25e6 before the bend and 90\u25e6 after the bend, close to\nDR21(OH) (i.e. streaming away from the observer along the\nline-of-sight). This 3D view of F3 seems to be corroborated by\nthe largest velocities in the IRAM data being found closest to\nDR21(OH). The total length of the F3 sub-filament would then\nbe at least 9.4 pc (7 pc divided by sin(48\u25e6 )) with no information\nabout the length along the line-of-sight after the bend, leading\nto a total dynamic timescale of \u223c2.1\u00d7106 yr, and an input mass\nrate of \u223c1.9\u00d710\u22123 M yr\u22121 (total mass of F3 on large and small\nscales divided by the timescale).\n5.2. Infall signatures across the filament\n\n\u22121\n\nkm s at a length of \u223c1 pc. If we assume that it connects to the\nlarge filament F3, the lower velocity levels are equally around\n\u20134 km s\u22121 , thus implying a total velocity range of 4.5 km s\u22121 .\nAgain, assuming an average angle to the line-of-sight of 57.3\u25e6 ,\nthis implies a very short dynamic lifetime of \u223c1.4\u00d7105 yr.\nIn addition, we note that in the high spatial resolution IRAM\ndata, this sub-filament shows a position angle of \u223c45\u25e6 in projection to the sky, while on a larger scale F3 is mostly east-west\noriented (PA \u223c 100\u25e6 ). This bend, which could be related to the\ndeep gravitational well of the DR21(OH) clump, may also be\npresent along the line-of-sight, explaining the apparent acceleration from 3 to 4.5 km s\u22121 along the sub-filament between\n\nFigure 11 shows an overlay of HCO+ 1\u21920 spectra (red) on a\ngreyscale plot of line integrated N2 H+ 1\u21920 emission (both at\nan angular resolution of \u223c3000 ). It is obvious that HCO+ displays along the whole filament the 'typical' profile of an optically thick spectral line which is indicative of infalling gas,\ni.e. a blue-shifted line wing that is stronger than the red wing\n(Myers et al. 1996). This self-absorption was already visible in\n12\nCO emission (Fig. 6) but becomes more pronounced using the\nHCO+ line. In order to quantify this infall signature, we determined the normalized integrated intensity (see Fig. 12 between\nthe blue and red line components (with T(blue)>T(red)), i.e. the\n'amount' of self-absorption, and plotted this quantity in Fig. 13.\n\n\f12\n\nN. Schneider et al.: DR21 filament\n\nIt is remarkable that self-absorption is seen everywhere in the\nfilament on a size scale of \u223c100 =5 pc with smooth transitions\nand not only locally at the position of mm-continuum sources.\nHowever, spectra with strongest self-absorption are found at the\nposition of N44 (DR21OH(M)).\nTo exclude the possibility that we observe several line components, we display in Fig. 14 examples of various lines at three\nselected positions (that are modeled in Sect. 5.3). First, the spectra show that 12 CO is not the most reliable infall tracer since it\nis ubiquitous and the infall profile is most clearly seen in HCO+ .\nThe figure also clearly proves that not two different cloud components are observed since all optically thin lines (C34 S, N2 H+ ,\nH13 CO+ ) peak in the emission gap of HCO+ . Apart from the\nknown line components at \u20133 km s\u22121 (bulk emision of the DR21\nfilament) and +9 km s\u22121 (W75N, only visible in 12 CO 2\u21921),\nthe 0 km s\u22121 component (see Sect. 4.2.3) is best traced in N2 H+\nemission.\nSince it is assured that we observe a true infall signature\nacross the DR21 filament, we determined the infall velocity vin\nto first order using the method described in Myers et al. (1996).\nvin =\n\n\u03c32\n1 + e(T BD /T D )\nln\nvred \u2212 vblue 1 + e(T RD /T D )\n\n(1)\n\nHere, \u03c3 is the H13 CO+ velocity dispersion, T RD , vred and\nT BD , vblue the temperature and the velocity of the red and\nblue part of the absorption profile, respectively, e=2.71828\nthe Eulerian number, and TD is the brightness temperature of\nthe dip. In all calculations, we excluded the area containing\nDR21 (\u2206\u03b4 <\u201310000 ). The velocity dispersion is determined\nfrom the FWHM line width\nof the optically thin H13 CO+ line\n\u221a\n(\u03c3=FWHM(H13 CO+ )/ 8 ln(2)). We disentangle the optically\nthin emission of the molecular ridge (\u223c\u20133 km s\u22121 ) from the infalling sub-filament at 0 km s\u22121 with a double Gaussian fit that\nprecisely determines \u03c3 of the bulk emission to be \u20133 km s\u22121 . For\nthe optically thick HCO+ line, we did not perform such a double\nGaussian fit since the \u20133 km s\u22121 component, showing the infall\nsignature, dominates strongly over the single Gaussian 0 km s\u22121\ncomponent (this means that the subfilament does not show an infall signature). We determined the temperature and the velocity\nof the red (T RD , vred ) and blue (T BD , vblue ) part of the absorption\nprofile by fitting a Gaussian to each wing. We only computed\nthe infall speed in a region where the emission of the second\ncomponent does not contribute significantly and confuse the absorption profile. We note that we consider each point in the map\nas a single two-layer model (as outlined in Myers et al. 1996).\nFigure 15 shows the results of this procedure. Supersonic infall velocities, vin >0.2 km s\u22121 for gas of a temperature of 10 K\n(typical value found), are detected within the red contour line,\ni.e. covering a large part of the filament. Interestingly, the highest values of vin (\u223c0.6\u20130.8 km s\u22121 ) are not detected exactly towards the column density maxima (indicated by N2 H+ and mmcontinuum emission in the right panels of Fig. 15), but, instead,\nshow some significant spatial offsets ranging from 2000 to 3000\n(i.e. of the order of 0.2 pc) in projection. In the center region\n(DR21OH(M) and N40) and in the south of the filament (N38\nand N48), high values of vin are mainly due to the increasing\noptical depth \u03c4 of the HCO+ line since the infall velocity is\ndetermined by the ratio T BD /T RD (eq. 1), which increases with\n\u03c4. In the north, higher values of vin are offset by \u223c2000 to the\ndense clump containing N51 to N54 and are mainly related to\nthe larger linewidths of the N2 H+ line (see Fig. 18, showing the\nsame increase in linewidth for H13 CO+ displaced with respect to\nthe dense clump).\n\nPlease note that this behaviour does not involve a gradual\nincrease in infall speed since we only determine the infall velocity at each point of the map assuming local infall at each point.\nFrom this figure, we can not extract the radial profile of the infall speed within the whole filament. For that, we need a more\nrealistic radiative transfer model, by considering the density and\ntemperature structure in the dense clumps of the filament as we\npresent in the next section.\n5.3. Radiative transport modelling with Simline\n\nWe used the 1D non-LTE radiative transfer code Simline\n(Ossenkopf et al. 2001) to simultaneously model the observed\noptically thin H13 CO+ and optically thick HCO+ lines of the two\nclumps indicated on the right panel of Fig. 15. These were extracted from the mm-continuum survey obtained by Motte et al.\n(2007) and characterize well the two major regions of infall. The\nsouthern Clump-14 is associated with DR21(OH) and contains\nthe cores N36, N38, N41, N44, and N48. In the northern part of\nthe filament, Clump-16 contains the cores N37, N43, N51, N53,\nand N54. The advantage of using mm-continuum data is that we\nhave a rather reliable mass estimate than can be used as input to\nthe model. Our ultimate goal is to derive the infall velocity and\nthe level of depletion by constraining a simple physical model\nfor these clumps.\n5.3.1. Input parameters and assumptions\n\nFor both clumps, we used the Gaussian parameters (flux and\nFWHM) determined by Motte et al. (2007) and assumed the\nmore realistic \u03c1(r) \u221d r\u22122 density profile to estimate the 90%\nmass and corresponding radius. We also recalculated the mass\ndown to the level of 10% of the peak contour Clump-16 taking a mass-averaged temperature of 20 K (rather than the median temperature of Cygnus X clumps, 15 K, used by Motte et\nal. 2007), which is in closer agreement with NH3 measurements\nof this clump (Wienen 2008). The model self-consistently takes\nthe mass corresponding to the mass-averaged temperature with\n\u0012 \u0013\u03b2\na profile T (r) = T in rrin , where \u03b2 is between \u20130.2 and \u20130.6 (T in\nand rin are the temperature and radius of the inner layer, see below). We adapted a two-layer geometry for the model since runs\nwith only one layer did not reproduce well the observed line profiles, a result similar to that of Jakob et al. (2007) who equally\napplied a two-layer model for their low-angular resolution mid-J\nCO and atomic CI lines. However, they modeled their observations without considering molecular depletion and no or only\nvery low infall speeds. We applied a subthermal external layer at\nconstant temperature with an average density of n\u223c103 -104 cm\u22123\nbecause the self-absorption dip is very deep.\nFor the determination of the turbulent line-width, we used\nthe optically thin line of H13 CO+ . A single Gaussian fit yielded\nline-widths of \u223c2.5\u00b10.5 km s\u22121 for Clump-14 and \u223c1.5\u00b10.5\nkm s\u22121 for Clump-16, respectively. This line-width is a result\nof thermal width, internal turbulence, and possible infall. Since\nboth turbulence and infall broaden the line, their parameter space\nmust be explored carefully.\nFor the HCO+ abundance, we take a value of X(HCO+ ) 15\u00d710\u22129 (e.g. Marseille et al. 2008) and adopt an isotope ratio 12 C/13 C = 67 (e.g. Lucas & Liszt 1998). However, HCO+\nis known to be depleted in cold environments and at densities\nhigher than \u223c105 cm\u22123 (Tafalla et al. 2002). We expect this happens in Clump-16 but to a lesser extent in Clump-14 since this\n\n\fN. Schneider et al.: DR21 filament\n\n13\n\nFig. 15. Left: Color plot of infall velocity.

We thus introduce a threshold density\nntresh in our model, with a sharp jump in the abundance profile\nif n> ntresh .

Results\n\nFigures 16 and 17 show the observed and modeled spectra of\nHCO+ and H13 CO+ for Clump-14 and Clump-16, respectively.\nFor better orientation, the two cuts are indicated in Fig. 15.\nTable 2 summarizes the explored parameter space and gives the\nresults for the best fitting model. We note that the spectra of\nboth sources have broad wings caused by outflow emission that\nwe did not account for in our modeling.\nClump-14\nFor Clump-14, our best-fit model closely reproduces the spectral\nlines of HCO+ (\u03c4 \u223c 25) and H13 CO+ (\u03c4 \u223c 0.8). It was necessary\nto use a rather large outer layer to reproduce well the absorption\ndip, which extends to R \u223c 0.9 pc increasing by 20% the mass of\nour model. We found that a temperature profile of \u03b2 \u223c \u22120.6 and\na mass-averaged temperature of 20 K provides a closest fit to our\ndata, where the discrepancy in the peak intensity of the lines is\nsmaller than 20%. This also indicates that the inner part of this\nclump tends to be hotter, reaching up to \u223c100 K in the central\npart.\nThe depletion occurs at a radius of 0.25 pc with a depletion\nratio of \u223c 7. This may be due to the temperature because the\ncentral region is a hot molecular core. With this configuration\nof geometry and parameters, we derive an infall speed of \u223c \u20130.6\nkm s\u22121 , which compares well with the values derived from the\n\n\f14\n\nN. Schneider et al.: DR21 filament\n\nFig. 16. Observed (black) and modeled (red) HCO+ and H13 CO+ 1\u21920 spectra of Clump-14 (see Fig 15 for the location of the cut).\n\nFig. 17. The same line Fig. 16 but for Clump-16.\nMyers et al. method (see Sect. 5.2).\nClump-16\nThe best-fit model for Clump-16 (Fig. 17) reproduces very well\nthe H13 CO+ line (\u03c4 \u223c 1) but less well the optically thick HCO+\nline (\u03c4 \u223c 26). Since the densities are lower for this clump, the extended outer layer is smaller than that of Clump-14 and reaches\nout to Rext \u223c0.8 pc reproducing the 103 cm\u22123 density. As we kept\nthe exponent \u03b2 for the temperature profile free, we found that\n\u03b2 = \u22120.5 most closely fits our data. This results in a maximum\nof T\u223c60 K in the central region. The depletion occurs at R\u223c 0.2\npc with a depletion ratio of 28, implying that in the central, very\ndense part of this clump, this molecule is strongly depleted.\nThe fit value of the infall speed is \u223c \u20130.5 km s\u22121 , again within\nthe range obtained from the more simple Myers et al. method.\nThe strongest constraint on the infallvelocity is the ratio of the\nleft-to-right wing intensity ratio, because the position of the plotted spectra is aligned with the optically thin line.\n\nTable 3.

Global infall properties of the DR21 filament\n\nTable 3 summarizes the infall properties of the two main infall\nregions that we defined in the Simline modeling. It is first important to understand that we discuss here the global dynamic\nfeatures of the molecular clumps on a size scale of \u223c0.5 pc, and\nnot the physical properties of individual cores on a size scale of\n\u223c0.1 pc.\nThe large global infall speeds on a \u223c0.5 pc size scale and\nthe high masses of the clumps lead to large global infall rates\nof \u1e40 of 5.8\u00d710\u22123 M yr\u22121 and 2.8\u00d710\u22123 M yr\u22121 for Clump14 and Clump-16, respectively. However, one has to distinguish\nbetween large-scale flow motions and local core collapse. The\nexpression 'infall' , representing material that is falling onto a\nprotostar or \u2013 more generally \u2013 into a gravitational potential\nwell that could form many stars within a core that is gravitationally collapsing has to be used with care. In Fig. 15, we see that\nthe highest values of 'infall' speed do not always correspond to\ndense cores, only source N48 shows a local peak for vin . For\nthe rest of the DR21 filament, the highest 'infall' speeds are\nfound in the less dense western part of the filament and not in\nthe dense post-shock gas. In view of the high mass infall rates,\nthis implies that there is a significant contribution of matter input either by directed flows (as would be the case for large-scale\nconvergent flows) or gravitational collapse of the DR21 filament\nitself on a large scale. Both clumps have a low virial parameter \u03b17 of 0.46 and 0.30 for Clump 14 and Clump 16, respectively, and are thus strongly gravitationally bound. Their freefall lifetimes t f f 8 are 0.9\u00d7105 yr (Clump 14) and 1.3\u00d7105 yr\n(Clump 16), a factor 20\u201330 shorter than the sound crossing time,\nwhich indicates that they are indeed in global collapse (if the\nsimple picture of a collapse onto a single gravitational potential\nThe virial parameter is defined to be \u03b1=Mvir /M where the virial\nmass is Mvir [M ]=699 \u03c32 [km/s]\u22122 R [pc] and the mass M from Table 2.\n\u0012\n\u00130.5\n3 cm\u22123\n8\nt f f [yr]=1.37 106 102n(H\n2)\n7\n\n\fN.

On the other hand, the infall rates are in agreement with the theoretical predictions of both the micro-turbulent\ncore model (McKee & Tan 2003) and the gravo-turbulent fragmentation model (e.g. Klessen et al. 1998, 2000, 2001, Padoan\n& Nordlund 2002, Banerjee & Pudritz 2007).\n5.5. The kinematic structure of the DR21 filament\n\nTo further characterize the kinematic structure of the DR21 filament, we determine the line velocity and velocity dispersion\nusing H13 CO+ and N2 H+ by fitting a Gaussian profile to the \u20133\nkm s\u22121 component as described in Sect. 5.2. For N2 H+ , we additionally fitted the hyperfine structure pattern of the molecule.\n5.5.1. Velocity dispersion\n\nFigure 18 reveals that the H13 CO+ main beam brightness temperature map shows a V-shaped feature in the north of the filament.\nThe western component is a factor 2-3 weaker than the eastern\none, which has a pronounced peak at the position of N51. This\npeak is stronger than that towards N44/DR21OH(M) (the reverse\nis true for the line integrated intensity, see Fig. 5).\nFig. 19. Color scale maps of the results of Gaussian line fitting\n(line integrated intensity and line velocity) to the \u20133 km s\u22121 component of N2 H+ 1\u21920 along the DR21 filament (but excluding\nthe region of DR21). Contours of velocity dispersion of H13 CO+\n(0.75 and 1 km s\u22121 ) are overlaid on the area map. Contour lines\nof the line integrated (\u20131 to 1 km s\u22121 ) emission of the 0 km s\u22121\ncomponent are overlaid on the velocity map (levels 1, 2, 3 K km\ns\u22121 ).\n\nFig. 18. Color scale maps of the results of Gaussian line fitting\n(temperature and velocity dispersion) to the \u20133 km s\u22121 component of H13 CO+ 1\u21920 along the DR21 filament (but excluding\nthe region of DR21). Contours of velocity dispersion (second\npanel) at 0.75 and 1 km s\u22121 are overlaid on both maps.\nMost remarkable, however, is the velocity dispersion \u03c3 (determined from the FWHM of the line with\n\u03c3=FWHM/(8 ln(2))0.5 ) seen in H13 CO+ as well as in N2 H+\n(not shown here). The velocity dispersion increases towards\nthe geometrical center of the filament from sonic levels to\nvalues of \u223c1.3 km s\u22121 . In the northern part of the filament\n(declination offset>000 ), the gradient is stronger than in the\nsouthern part (south of N44/DR21OH-(M)) where we see\na more homogeneous distribution of \u03c3. Interestingly, in the\nnorthern part of the region highest \u03c3-values are found between\nthe two vertical features of H13 CO+ emission (with a decrease\n\nof \u03c3 from \u223c1 km s\u22121 to \u223c0.8 km s\u22121 in the densest region in\nthe east). This becomes even more obvious in Fig. 19 where\nwe plot contours of \u03c3 (from H13 CO+ ) over a map of N2 H+\nline integrated intensity (proportional to the column density).\nThus, there is a clear offset between high \u03c3 and high column\ndensities. This scenario can be explained if it is assumed that\nclumps are produced by turbulent flows because in this case,\nthe densest gas has been shocked and slowed down so that the\nlargest velocity dispersions do not occur in the densest regions\nbut in the outskirts (Klessen et al. 2005, Vazquez-Semadeni\net al. 2008, Federrath et al. 2009). We return to this point in\nthe discussion. The southern part (offset DEC<000 ) seems to\nbehave differently. The N2 H+ column density and H13 CO+ line\ntemperature are highest in the core region (\u223c0.5 pc diameter) of\nN38, while the velocity dispersion remains on a rather constant,\nhigh-level of around 1.2 km s\u22121 in an area of \u223c1 pc diameter.\nHowever, a projection effect could explain the difference.: it is\npossible that a similar offset between velocity dispersion and\nhighest density region is seen face-on.\n5.5.2. Velocity field\n\nFigure 19 shows the complex velocity field of the DR21 filament\ndetermined from N2 H+ (the H13 CO+ map not shown here looks\nvery similar). Three main, basically horizontal, projected velocity gradients are observed. While the northern and southern part\nshow a decrease of velocity from west to east (\u20132.2 and \u20130.8 km\ns\u22121 pc\u22121 ), the middle part has a positive value of +2.3 km s\u22121\npc\u22121 . Interestingly, we observe in this region a 'turnover' in the\n\n\f16\n\nN. Schneider et al.: DR21 filament\n\nvelocity gradient that corresponds to the material of the 0 km s\u22121\ncomponent 'falling' onto the bulk of the filament (see Fig. 19). It\nis clear that the velocity pattern cannot be explained with a single rotation of the filament along a vertical axis. An alternative\nexplanation would again be that at least a part of the observed\nmotion is due to convergent flows (see Sect. 6) and/or rotation of\nthe individual parts of the filament.\n\n6. Discussion\nThe dynamic structure of the DR21 filament exhibits several remarkable features:\n\u2013 Several sub-filaments are connected to the DR21 filament,\nthe most massive one, F3, being clearly linked to the\nDR21(OH) clump.\n\u2013 Global infall signatures are seen all across the filament (on a\nlength scale of a few pc).\n\u2013 The highest values of the velocity dispersion are found in a\nvertical projected region of low column density gas, offset\nfrom the dense clumps seen in N2 H+ .\n\u2013 Three horizontal (west-east) velocity gradients (\u20130.8, +2.2,\n+2.3 km s\u22121 pc\u22121 ) exist in the filament.\nAll of these findings point towards a very dynamic nature\nof the DR21 filament in which motions are not randomly distributed but show clear signs of systematic dynamics. These features all point to local converging flows being the driving source\nof the whole filament, with an increase in density at the stagnation points of the flows (Sect. 6.1). In addition, the large-scale\ninfall signatures observed all over the filament point towards a\nscenario in which gravity is the dominant driving force on the\nscale of the filament (Sects. 6.2 and 6.3). On the other hand, the\norigin of the large-scale flows is difficult to constrain. It is possible that the large-scale dynamics are a remains of the formation\nprocess of the molecular complex, but may also originate either\nfrom self-gravity on larger scales, or large-scale turbulence injection (Sects. 6.4 and 6.5).\n6.1. Organized motions: signposts of convergent flows\n\nThe clouds of the whole Cygnus North region are very similar\nin their physical properties (morphology, density etc.) to clouds\nthat were created by colliding flow scenarios in models (e.g. the\nfinal stage of the Gf2 model from Heitsch & Hartmann 2008).\nThe DR21 filament is part of a complex network of interconnected filamentary structures (Sec. 4.1) and could thus indeed\nbe the result of a convergent, turbulent flow. In particular, the\noffset of the infall speed from the densest regions is consistent\nwith a scenario where supersonic flows shock at their stagnation\npoints are offset from the dense postshock gas on both sides of\nthe filament. In this case, high-density clumps/cores are built up\nat the stagnation points of the colliding flow and would explain\nthe distribution of the dense mm-cores along the DR21 filament.\nIt suggests that the cores are dynamically distributed through the\nregion before they evolve into intermediate or high-mass starforming clusters. From the mm-continuum survey of Motte et\nal. (2007), we determined that approximately 15% of the mass\nof the filament is contained in dense cores, in accordance with\nthe predictions of Heitsch & Hartmann (2008).\nAnother observational results that agrees with supersonic\nisothermal simulations is the velocity field and the distribution\nof the velocity dispersion (\u03c3). We observe different velocity gradients along the filament. Figure 19 shows in the northern and\n\nsouthern part of the filament a negative gradient in the WEdirection whereas at the position of DR21(OH) (where the subfilament falls onto the densest region), this gradient is reversed.\nIt is unlikely that the gradients are only caused by rotation (see,\ne.g. Goodman et al. 1993 for typical observational signatures of\nuniform rotation). Moreover, they can be explained in the turbulent colliding flow view, where clumps are sheared and compressed due to the flow motions and retain the signature of the\nexternal flow that formed them (Ballesteros-Paredes et al. 1999,\nVazquez-Semadeni et al. 2008) so that only parts of the filaments\nare rotating.\nThe shock front created by the colliding flows creates an inner dense post-shock region and an outer lower-density region\nof supersonic inflow. Cores are then formed by 'gravoturbulent fragmentation' (Klessen et al. 2005, Hennebelle & Chabrier\n2008), which characterizes a hierarchy of smaller and smaller\nentities. The local collapse of a core occurs when self-gravity\novercomes the gas pressure (including the turbulent contribution to pressure). The whole process leads to a higher velocity\ndispersion outside the clump/core than in the more quiescent\npost-shocked interior (Klessen et al. 2005, Gomez et al. 2007,\nVazquez-Semadeni et al. 2008), which is precisely what we observe in the DR21 filament. Figure 1 in Klessen et al. (2005) illustrates this scenario in a non-magnetic SPH (smoothed particle\nhydrodynamics) model. Here, we provide evidence of the same\nscenario in Fig. 20, where we show a map of the velocity dispersion obtained in a driven turbulence simulation by Federrath\net al. (2009). The simulation used fully compressive (curl-free)\nforcing to excite turbulent motions, though models with solenodial (divergence-free) forcing (not shown here) produce similar\nresults. In general, compressive forcing produces greater density contrasts with higher density enhancements and larger voids\nthan solenodial forcing (Federrath et al. 2008, 2009). This could\nbe the case for the DR21 filament since it is here where we observe the massive dense cores with densities higher than 105\ncm\u22123 and masses up to 200 M . The velocity field primarily consists of converging flows, which create strong density enhancements. Column density contours are overlaid on the velocity dispersion, showing that \u03c3 and density peaks are offset from one\nanother, as in our observations shown in Fig. 15 (middle panel)\nof the DR21 filament. High density gas is primarily found in\nregions of low \u03c3, while lower density regions have higher \u03c3.\nWe emphasise that the simulation did not include self-gravity.\nNevertheless, the velocity dispersion\u2013density structure is similar\nto what is observed in the DR21 filament, which indicates that\nthe observed structures can be produced by converging supersonic gas flows only, without the necessity of a global gravitational collapse. However, converging gas flows are also created\nby global collapse. If supersonic flows and global collapse act\nsimultaneously, it is difficult to disentangle their individual contribution to the creation of the velocity dispersion\u2013density structure seen in our observations and in the simulations (see Sect. 6.5\nbelow for a general discussion of the origin of converging flows).\n6.2. Self-gravity, the main driving force in the DR21 filament?\n\nObservationally, the ubiquity of the blue-shifted asymmetric line\nprofiles in all optically thick lines indicates inflow motions. This\nis a strong hint that self-gravitation plays a significant role for the\ndense and massive DR21 filament. In addition, the most massive\nsub-filament F3, which is a good candidate to flow towards the\nmain filament, seems to bend towards the center of the largest\ngravitation well of the whole filament, the DR21(OH) clump\n(see Sect. 5.1). This bend may be indicative of a dominant role of\n\n\fN. Schneider et al.: DR21 filament\n\n17\n\nFig. 20. Results of a hydrodynamic turbulence simulation by Federrath et al. (2009), considering only compressive (curl-free) forcing. The Mach numbers reached in this simulation are comparable to the typical Mach numbers observed in the DR21 filament. The\ncolor-coded velocity dispersion is in units of the sound speed, while contours of column density are overlaid on it. The simulation\nwas performed with the grid code FLASH3 and used 10243 computational elements. This figure can be directly compared to Fig. 15\n(middle panel), also showing a prominent offset between the maxima of velocities and column densities.\n\nFig. 21. In the left-hand plot, we show the column density distribution from an MHD code (Hennebelle et al., Teyssier 2002,\nFromang et al. 2006). In the right plot, the projected velocity field is overlaid on the column density distribution.\ngravity as the flowing material approaches the main filament. At\nlarger distances, the effect of large-scale magnetic fields could\nbe the cause that keeps it in an almost east-west direction (see\nSect. 6.3).\nAs shown in Sect. 6.1, we are able to explain the spatial displacement between the maximum of the velocity dispersion and\nthe dense gas and the velocity field of the DR21 filament in the\ncontext of supersonic isothermal simulations that do not include\nself-gravity. However, models of isothermal, non-magnetic, but\nself-gravitating turbulence produce a velocity divergence of typically 0.6 km s\u22121 pc\u22121 for a 1 pc region (Vazquez-Semadeni et al.\n2008). The authors propose that the assumption that the velocity dispersion is produced only by random motion is incomplete\n\nand that even in the presence of driven turbulence a part of the\nobserved velocity dispersion is caused by clump-scale inward\nmotions due to gravitational collapse. In this large-scale inflow\n(LSI) scenario, the velocity field on all scales includes a significant inflow component.\n6.3. Role of magnetic field: MHD with self-gravity modeling\n\nWe observed several sub-filaments that are attached to the DR21\nfilament (Sects. 4.2). The orientation of the sub-filaments is\nnot arbitrary: they follow the magnetic field lines that run orthogonal to the NS-orientated DR21 filament (Vall\u00e9e & Fiege\n2006, Kirby 2009). Magnetohydrodynamic turbulence models\n\n\f18\n\nN. Schneider et al.: DR21 filament\n\nFig. 22. Results from the same MHD turbulence model (Hennebelle et al., Teyssier 2002, Fromang et al. 2006) shown in Fig. 20.\nTop: Velocity dispersion (left) and velocity field (right). Bottom: Magnetic field with field vectors overlaid on it.\nprecisely produce such filamentary structures (Fig. 21) that are\naligned with the magnetic field (Fig. 22). Hennebelle & Audit\n(2008) found that self-gravitating MHD models produce more\nfilamentary structures than purely hydrodynamic models. These\nnumerical simulations were specifically designed for this object\nand the initial conditions resemble those used in Peretto et al.\n(2007). They consist of an elongated clump with an initial aspect\nratio of 2 and\nprofile \u03c1(r, z) = \u03c10 /(1 + (r/r0 )2 + (z/z0 )2 ),\n\u221a a 2density\n2\nwhere r = (x + y ), z0 = 2r0 , r0 = 5 pc and \u03c10 = 500 cm\u22123 .\nThe density at the edge of the cloud is equal to 50 cm\u22123 and is\n10 times lower than the value outside the cloud. Turbulence is\nseeded initially in such a way that the clump is approximately in\nvirial equilibrium. The initial temperature is 10 K and the clump\nis threaded by a magnetic field parallel to the x-axis. Its intensity is proportional to the cloud column density and the peak\nvalue is about 7 \u03bcG making the magnetic energy about 4 times\nlower than the turbulent one and 5 times higher than the thermal\nenergy. This simple initial configuration for the magnetic field\nis suggested by the observations of Vall\u00e9e & Fiege (2006), who\nshow that the magnetic field is indeed perpendicular to the major\naxis of DR21. The simulation was performed with the Ramses\n\ncode (Teyssier 2002, Fromang et al. 2006). Since the cloud occupies a small fraction (about 5 percent) of the computational\ndomain, the following strategy is adopted. Initially a uniform\n1283 computational grid is used (level 7). Then, all the cells of\ndensity above 10 cm\u22123 and 40 cm\u22123 are refined to the level 8 and\n9, respectively. This ensures that initially the clump is described\nwith about 3\u00d7106 computing cells. As the collapse proceeds, the\nresolution is adjusted requiring at least 10 cells per Jeans length\nup to level 14.\nIn the left-hand panel of Fig. 21, the distribution of the column density is shown and in the right-hand figure panel, the\nvelocity field vectors are overlaid on top. The column density is smoothed to a beam of \u223c0.1 pc angular resolution (that\nof the IRAM 30m molecular line observations). The resemblance to the DR21 filament is evident with an elongated vertical main filament and several subfilaments attached to it. Several\nclumps/cores (size scales <0.5 pc) with high H2 column densities (>1024 cm\u22122 ) have formed in the filament, in agreement with\nour observations.\nFigure 22 shows the mean velocity dispersion, the mean velocity field along the line of sight, and the averaged magnetic\n\n\fN. Schneider et al.: DR21 filament\n\nfield. For the velocity dispersion \u03c3, we observe the same offset\nbetween regions of high density and \u03c3 as seen in Fig. 20. The\nmodeled velocity field is as inhomogenous as the observed one,\nthough the gradients have slightly larger values (up to a few km\ns\u22121 pc\u22121 ) and the same direction (no turn in sign as we found for\nthe region around the DR21(OH) clump). The magnetic field is\nparticularly interesting. The total magnetic intensity is displayed\nin Fig. 22 (bottom), the arrows showing the direction of the magnetic field in the xz plane. The sub-filaments are clearly aligned\nalong the magnetic field and even sometimes pinched by it. This\nis in full accordance with our observations and points toward a\nscenario in which the DR21 filament is fed with material along\nEW- orientated magnetic field lines. A full network of these subfilaments was detected in recent JCMT 12 CO 3\u21922 data (Richer\net al., in prep.). A more detailed discussion of these observations\nand MHD modelling will be presented in a forthcoming paper\n(Csengeri, Hennebelle et al., in prep.).\nHowever, the prinicipal driver of these flows remains unclear.\nIs it external, large-scale driven turbulence or the gravitational\nattraction of the gas itself, or both? A possible scenario is that\nfirst, the turbulence creates the density fluctuations (clumps and\nfilaments) by means of locally convergent flows, and then, for\nsome of the more massive fluctuations,gravity takes over, making the inflow stronger and driving the material to higher densities. We probably see both effects in the DR21 filament: turbulent compression and self-gravity. The northern part is probably\nin an earlier stage where the external flow is still important in\nshaping the velocity field (hence the offset of the 1st and 2nd\nvelocity moments from the density map). In the southern part,\nwe see a more advanced stage in which gravity dominates and\ngravitational infall extends all the way to the center (leading to\nthe coincidence of the density and velocity structures).\n\n19\n\n(Klessen et al. 1998, Folini & Walder 2006, Vazquez-Semadeni\net al. 2007, Heitsch et al. 2008, Banerjee et al. 2009, Federrath\net al. 2009). Common for all 'convergent-flow' scenarios is the\nbasic principle that the clouds result from a pileup of material,\ni.e. atomic hydrogen, from large-scale supersonic flows, caused\nby energetic events such as supernovae, expanding HII-regions,\ngalactic spiral density waves. The driving force could be the injection of supersonic turbulence on large scales in a pre-existing\nmolecular complex. Supersonic turbulence necessarily leads to\norganized supersonic motions on smaller scales, and then leads\nto the formation of filaments and clumps, and then stars. Finally,\nthe self-gravity of a pre-existing molecular complex may play a\nrole in driving the flows. Altogether, it is difficult to trace back\nthe origin of the large-scale motions observed here. But at least\non the observed scales, the motions are supersonic and are converging to form dense structures such as the DR21 filament.\nWhether a more quasi-static evolution is possible on smaller\nscales or in other parts of the complex to drive the evolution\ntowards (high-mass) star formation cannot be addressed by the\npresent observations. In Csengeri et al. (2010), we address the\nkinematic state of the small scale, densest structures in the complex, the i.e., massive dense cores, using PdBI data (Csengeri et\nal. in prep).\nTo distinguish the formation scenarios more clarly on large\nscales, it is not clear which other observational signatures can\nbe expected. The DR21 filament itself is already a rather dense\nstructure and in order to detect residues of the formation process, it is neccessary to inspect the distribution of low-density,\nsubsonic gas using atomic hydrogen and low-density tracers\nsuch as 12 CO. We will address this point in a subsequent paper\n(Csengeri, Hennebelle et al., in prep.).\n\n7. Summary and conclusions\n6.4. Are the observed sub-filaments able to maintain the\nformation of the DR21 filament?\n\nWe observed that several sub-filaments are attached to the DR21\nfilament (Sect. 4.2), possibly serving as a reservoir of gas for\nfurther mass growth. These organized flows help to sustain high\naccretion rates for times long enough to build up very massive\nclumps/cores (Vazquez-Semadeni et al. 2009). We note that the\nDR21(OH)-clump has a mass of higher than 5000 M in a radius of \u223c0.5 pc, which makes it one of the most massive clumps\nknown in the Galaxy. The F3-filament (Sect. 5.1) has an average\nmass input rate of 1.9\u00d710\u22123 M yr\u22121 so that it may contribute\nup to \u223c 30 % of the total mass infall rate of 5.8\u00d710\u22123 M yr\u22121\nobserved for the DR21(OH) clump as a whole (Clump 14, see\nTable 3) for the next 2.1\u00d7106 yr. Accounting for the other less\nmassive sub-filaments, which may also contribute, this indicates\nthat the mass flow rates are of the correct order of magnitude to\nexplain the formation of the DR21 filament. On the other hand,\nthey seem insufficient to build the present 5000 M DR21(OH)\nclump, which suggests that the mass flow rate must have been\nhigher in the past and that the process that produced the DR21\nfilament may be declining.\n6.5. Origin of the converging flows that formed the DR21\nfilament\n\nOne physical scenario that intrinsically includes strong dynamics is that of molecular clouds and complexes being formed by\nlarge-scale HI convergent flows, which would then drive the\nwhole dynamics of the complex down to the star-formation scale\n\nWe have presented a detailed molecular line study of the\nmolecular ridge containing the star-forming regions DR21 and\nDR21(OH). This ridge is embedded in a large-scale network of\nfilamentary structures, revealed by our maps of 13 CO 1\u21920, CS\n2\u21921, and N2 H+ 1\u21920 emission obtained with the FCRAO. It\nis the most massive (around 30 000 M ) and dense (average\ndensity \u223c104 cm\u22123 ) filament within the region and is labeled\nby us the 'DR21 filament'. Several sub-filaments are linked to\nthe DR21 filament, the most massive one runs orthogonal to the\nNorth-South oriented ridge and has a mass (determined from\n13\nCO 1\u21920) of 2600 M and an average density of 690 cm\u22123 .\nIts inferred dynamical time is \u223c2\u00d7106 yr.\nHigher angular resolution IRAM molecular line observations in HCO+ , H13 CO+ , 12 CO/13 CO 2\u21921, C34 S, N2 H+ , and\nH2 CO resolve the detailed structure of the DR21 filalment. The\nH13 CO+ 1\u21920 data show how the sub-filament seen in 13 CO connects directly to the DR21(OH) clump. From the 12 CO 2\u21921\nline mapping, we confirmed the known outflow sources DR21\nand DR21(OH) and detected three new ones, correlated with the\nmm-continuum sources N53, N44, and N45 (Motte et al. 2007).\nThe HCO+ 1\u21920 line shows self-absorbed lines across the whole\nfilament. Since optically thin lines peak in the gap and the blue\nwing of HCO+ is more intense than the red one, we conclude\nthat this emission feature is due to infalling gas. The typical infall speed, determined with a simple method described in Myers\net al. (1996), is 0.6\u20130.8 km s\u22121 . A more sophisicated non-LTE\nmodelling of the HCO+ and H13 CO+ lines using the Simline radiative transfer code yields an infall speed of 0.5 and 0.6 km\ns\u22121 for the northern and southern part of the DR21 filament (but\nexcluding the DR21 region itself), respectively.\n\n\f20\n\nN. Schneider et al.: DR21 filament\n\nThe kinematic structure of the DR21 filament is remarkable.\nWe measured, using the N2 H+ , H13 CO+ , and HCO+ maps, the\nhighest values of the velocity dispersion in a vertical column of\nlow column density gas that is offset from the dense clumps seen\nin N2 H+ . These results can be explained if the filament was produced by turbulent flows. In this case, the densest gas has been\nshocked and slowed down so that the largest velocity dispersions\ndo occur not in the densest regions but in the outskirts (Klessen\net al. 2005, Vazquez-Semadeni et al. 2008). We also observe\nthree horizontal (west-east) velocity gradients (\u20130.8, \u20132.2, +2.3\nkm s\u22121 pc\u22121 ) in the filament in which the one with the positive\nvalue marks the location where the filament is 'falling' onto the\nDR21(OH) clump. This velocity pattern cannot be explained by\na single rotation of the filament along a vertical axis. An alternative explanation would be that at least part of the observed\nmotions is due to convergent flows.\nBy comparing our observations of the DR21 filament\nwith a hydrodynamic (Federrath et al. 2009) and a magnetohydrodynamic turbulence model (Hennebelle et al., Teyssier\n2002, Fromang et al. 2006), we infer that a very dynamic and\nfast mode of star formation occurs in the filament, in which gas\nis continuously replenished by subfilaments attached to the main\nfilament. These subfilaments are aligned with the magnetic field\ndirection that is perpendicular to the DR21 filament (Vallee &\nFiege 2006). The DR21 filament is globally collapsing. All our\nobservational findings are incompatible with the view of a quasistatic, pressure-bounded clump scenario.\nAcknowledgements. We thank A. Belloche and D.
