The diversity of applications is reflected in a rather large variety of different\ngraph models considered. Generic random graph and\nnetwork models include the most general Erd\u00f6s-R\u00e9nyi\nmodel of n bonds distributed randomly between pairs\nselected from N vertices, as well as the Barab\u00e1si-Albert\ngraphs constructed with the preferential attachment rule\nor the Watts-Strogatz method of interpolating between\na regular lattice and a random graph via rewiring of\nlinks1 . These constructions result in variable, but uncorrelated vertex degrees with graph ensembles fully defined by the co-ordination number distribution P (q). On\nthe other hand, fixed-degree or k-regular random graphs\nhave also been considered, which are equivalent to the\nnon-planar or \"thin\" \u03c63 , \u03c64 , . . . Feynman diagrams of\na zero-dimensional field theory4 . While none of these\nnetworks feature a well-defined topology allowing for a\nlocal geometrical interpretation, a fattening of the thin\ngraph propagators to ribbons yields orientable faces, enabling an interpretation of the graphs as random surfaces of fixed genus. The resulting dynamical triangulations model has been thoroughly studied with matrix\nmodel and combinatorial methods in the context of Euclidean quantum gravity3. The topological constraint induces spatial correlations in the degree distribution, and\nthe ensemble of graphs is no longer fully determined by\nP (q). Other ensembles of random graphs of well-defined\ntopology have been studied, for instance the Poissonian\nVorono\u0131\u0308-Delaunay tessellations resulting from a generalisation of the crystallographic Wigner-Seitz construction\nto randomly distributed generators5.\nA lot of effort has been invested in understanding the\ngeneric geometrical properties of these graph ensembles.\nIn particular, for the network-type models dynamical\nproperties have been regularly considered, such as the\n\nemergence of a giant component as edges are successively\nadded to the graphs1. For the Delaunay and dynamical\ntessellations with a well-defined topology, genuinely geometrical attributes such as the fractal or Hausdorff dimension and the correlation function of the local degrees\nhave been of most interest3,5 . As an alternative to direct\ninvestigations, these ensembles might be characterised by\nobserving the cooperative behaviour of matter variables\nsuch as classical Ising spins si = \u00b11 with Hamiltonian\nX\nJij si sj ,\n(1)\nH=\u2212\nhi,ji\n\nor more general Potts or O(n) spins placed on the graph\nvertices, assuming ferromagnetic couplings Jij = J0 > 0.\nThis exercise is also of interest from the inverted point-ofview of studying the effect of these various types of connectivity disorder on the spin models, being complementary to the canonical case of weak disorder from randomness of the couplings on regular lattices6 . Graphs without topological constraint are inherently non-local and\nthus effectively infinite-dimensional. Consequently, one\nexpects mean-field phase transitions for the ferromagnetic models. These are indeed found for the Erd\u00f6s-R\u00e9nyi\nand k-regular (or thin) random graphs2,4,7,8,9,10 , transforming them into convenient alternatives to treatments\non the Bethe lattice or the complete graph, not encumbered with boundary effects. More generally, degree distributions with divergent moments can lead to interesting\ndeviations from mean-field behaviour11 . The effects on\nsurface-like graphs are less homogeneous. For (uncorrelated) bond disorder, the celebrated Harris criterion6\npredicts a change of critical behaviour for cases with a\npositive specific-heat exponent \u03b1. An analogous criterion\ncan be formulated for random graphs, taking into account the spatial correlation of the degree distribution12 .\nThe predicted change in universality class for virtually\nall types of matter coupled to dynamical triangulations\nor fat graphs is in agreement with exact results for\npercolation13 and numerical investigations of the Ising\nand Potts models14 . For Vorono\u0131\u0308-Delaunay tessellations,\nhowever, the predicted change of universality class for\n\n\f2\n\nFIG. 1: The link-flip move on two adjacent triangles of a\ndynamical triangulation (dashed lines). The solid lines denote\nthe corresponding dual, three-valent, \"fat\" \u03c63 graphs.\n\nmodels with \u03b1 > 0 such as the two-dimensional q = 3, 4\nPotts and three-dimensional Ising models is not observed\nnumerically15,16 . It is an open problem why, instead,\nthese models behave according to their regular lattice\ncritical exponents.\nIn contrast to this weak-disorder case, the effect of connectivity disorder on models with antiferromagnetic interactions is much more profound. The existence of oddlength loops on many of the graphs discussed leads to\nsevere geometric frustration with the possibility of altogether precluding the onset of a long-range ordered\nphase. Interestingly, however, this problem for random\ngraphs has received very little attention to date8 , such\nthat the behaviour of, e.g., the Ising antiferromagnet for\nthe various cases is unclear. The effect of tuning the\namount of frustration on a regular lattice has been considered in Ref. 17 for the \u00b1J Ising model on the triangular lattice, where it was found that a spin-glass phase appears as the concentration p of antiferromagnetic bonds\nis increased from zero and disappears again as the system comes close to the perfect frustration of the pure\nantiferromagnet. Some use has been made of k-regular\nor thin random graphs as an alternative realisation of\nthe mean-field limit of spin glasses2,7 , and in general one\nexpects the perfect frustration of the effectively infinitedimensional graphs of the non-topological type to lead\nto mean-field spin-glass behaviour for the antiferromagnet. The less extreme case of fixed-topology graphs is\nthe subject of the present study.\nThe rest of the paper is organised as follows. Section II discusses the general problem of frustration exerted by graphs of the dynamical triangulations type on\nantiferromagnets and the annealed and quenched limits\nfor the Ising antiferromagnet coupled to different graph\ntypes. The results of Monte Carlo simulations for the\nannealed case are discussed. In Sec. III, we investigate\nthe quenched limit by means of exact ground-state computations in the framework of a defect-wall calculation,\ncomparing Gaussian and bimodal spin glasses to the antiferromagnet. Finally, Sec. IV contains our conclusions.\n\nII.\n\nFRUSTRATION FROM FAT GRAPHS\n\nDynamical triangulations originate in the discrete approach to Euclidean quantum gravity via a path-integral\nquantisation of the gravitational interaction. The inte-\n\ngral over metrics is regularised by a sum over combinatorial manifolds or simplicial complexes3 . We focus here\non the case of two dimensions, where this amounts to a\nsum over all possible gluings of equilateral triangles to\nclosed, orientable surfaces of a given, for instance planar or toroidal, topology. Graphs of this type are hence\nconstructed by taking a number N2 of equilateral triangles and connecting them together along their edges\nat random, such that the resulting graph represents a\nclosed and orientable surface of well-defined topology. In\na computer simulation, such graphs can be implemented\nby the successive application of the \"link-flip\" move depicted in Fig. 1 to the graph starting, e.g., from a regular hexagonal lattice with periodic boundary conditions.\nThe geometric duals of these triangulations naturally are\ngraphs of fixed degree k = 3, known as planar \u03c63 Feynman diagrams in field theory. The planarity constraint\nnecessitates a \"fattening\" of the usual propagators to ribbons, such that this type of diagrams is often refered to\nas \"fat graphs\"18. Instead of triangles, one can, of course,\nconsider more general elementary polygons, such as the\nquadrangulations constructed from gluings of squares,\nwhose duals are then consequently \"fat\" \u03c64 graphs etc.\nThe resulting combinatorial problem of counting these\ndiscrete surfaces can be solved exactly for various cases\nusing a matrix-model formulation19 or alternative combinatorial approaches20,21 . Geometrically, the most striking result is that of an unusually large internal Hausdorff\ndimension dh = 4 for these topologically two-dimensional\nsurfaces3 , resulting from a structure of \"baby universes\"\nconnected to the main graph body with a minimal number of links (\"bottlenecks\"). This fractal structure is apparent from the example graph embedding shown in Fig.\n2: while the graphs themselves are, by construction, defined in a purely intrinsic manner, without reference to\nan embedding into external space, an approximate embedding to some extent observing the constraint of equal\nedge lengths can be constructed to visualise the internal\ngeometry23 . The distribution P (q) of co-ordination numbers is found to fall off exponentially22,23 and hence does\nnot exhibit the fat tails found in small-world networks.\nHowever, the structure of the graphs is not solely determined by P (q), since the well-defined topology introduces\nlong-range correlations in the co-ordination numbers, declining as r\u22122 at large separations r.12\n\nA.\n\nAnnealed average\n\nWhen coupling matter variables to the graphs, averages have to be performed for the fluctuations of the\ngraphs as well as those of the coupled spins with associated characteristic time scales \u03c4graph and \u03c4matter . The\nannealed case of \u03c4graph = \u03c4matter is the situation considered in the context of matter coupled to quantum gravity.\nSince spin and disorder degrees-of-freedom fluctuate on\nthe same time scales, the total free energy of the system\n\n\f3\nJij = \u2212J0 for all bonds, coupled to the following dynamical graphs:\n\nFIG. 2: Example of a dynamical triangulation of N2 = 5 000\ntriangles embedded into Euclidean space. Note that the equilaterality requirement for the triangles is only approximately\nfulfilled since an exact embedding into R3 is not guaranteed\nto exist.\n\nis given by\nFannealed(\u03b2) = \u2212\u03b2 \u22121 lnhZ(\u03b2, G)iG ,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere Z(\u03b2, G) denotes the partition function for spins\non a fixed graph G and h*iG symbolises the average over\nthe considered graph ensemble. Hence, the effect of geometric randomness on the behaviour of spins is augmented by a back-reaction of matter variables on the underlying graphs. Formulating the combined problem as a\nmulti-matrix model, several cases such as the (ferromagnetic) Ising24,25 , q-state Potts-26,27 and O(n) models28,29\n(where the two latter classes, of course, include the simpler Ising model as the special cases q = 2 resp. n = 1)\ncan be treated analytically (in the regime where they\nshow continuous phase transitions on regular lattices, i.e.,\nfor q \u2264 4 resp. \u22122 \u2264 n \u2264 2). In these cases, the coupling\nto dynamical triangulations results in a shift of universality class. More generally, in the framework of Liouville\ntheory, the dressing of conformal weights \u2206 of critical\nmatter coupled to two-dimensional quantum gravity is\npredicted to be30,31,32\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u2212 c + 24\u2206 \u2212 1 \u2212 c\n \u0303 = 1\u221a\n\u221a\n\u2206\n,\n(3)\n25 \u2212 c \u2212 1 \u2212 c\nwhere c denotes the central charge33 . The resulting critical exponents agree with the exact results discussed\nabove, and the predictions for a number of cases have\nbeen confirmed by numerical simulation studies, see, e.g.,\nRefs. 34,35,36.\nCoupling antiferromagnets to this type of random\ngraphs leads to strong frustration37 due to the presence of loops of odd length. Depending on the exact\ntype of graphs considered, however, the annealed average to some extent allows for the geometry to adapt to\nthe antiferromagnetic interactions. In particular, consider an Ising antiferromagnet according to Eq. (1) with\n\n\u2022 Triangulations: Here, all elementary faces of the\ngraph are frustrated, and the frustration cannot be\nrelieved by a dynamic response of the lattice. As\nhas been shown by Wannier38 , the Ising antiferromagnet on a regular triangular lattice remains\nparamagnetic down to zero temperature where, due\nto frustration, the system has a finite residual entropy. It is clear that for any planar triangulation (whether regular or random) configurations of\nminimal energy have two satisfied and one broken bond in each triangle. A large number of\nsuch states exists already for the triangular lattice,\nwhich is a member of the ensemble of dynamical\ntriangulations considered. The freedom of changing spin configurations without leaving the groundstate manifold is found to be local, offering no energetic reward and thus precluding long-range order.\nIn fact, the residual, zero-temperature entropy of\nthis model has been calculated39 to be S0 \u2248 0.2613,\nto be compared to the value S0 \u2248 0.3383 found for\nthe triangular antiferromagnet38 .\n\u2022 Quadrangulations: Any planar quadrangulation\nis bipartite - it cannot contain any loops of odd\nlength since all loops are composed of the elementary faces of length four. This structure allows\nfor a two-colouring of the lattice vertices in, say,\nblack and white sites. Introducing extra (nonfluctuating) signs \u01ebi = \u00b11 at the vertices and performing a Mattis transformation as40\n\u2032\ns\u2032i = \u01ebi si , Jij\n= Jij \u01ebi \u01ebj ,\n\n(4)\n\nleaves the Hamiltonian (1) and thus the partition\nfunction invariant. Choosing \u01ebW\n= \u22121 for the\ni\nwhite and \u01ebB\n=\n+1\nfor\nthe\nblack\nvertices maps\ni\nthe system identically to the Ising ferromagnet with\nJij = +J0 . Hence, for the random lattice the results of Refs. 24,25 apply, and the system undergoes a third-order phase transition to a N\u00e9el ordered state.\n\u2022 \u03c63 or \u03c64 graphs: While neither of these graph\nclasses is bipartite as a whole, it is clear that, e.g.,\nwith the hexagonal lattice (\u03c63 graphs) resp. the\nsquare lattice (\u03c64 graphs) bipartite graphs occur in\nboth ensembles. Hence the ground states of either\nsystem are perfectly N\u00e9el ordered configurations,\nand it is reasonable to expect long-range order to\npersist for some finite range of temperatures.\nTo investigate this last case of a non-trivial interaction\nbetween geometric frustration and antiferromagnetism,\nwe performed Monte Carlo simulations of the coupled\nsystem for graph sizes of N2 = 162 up to 1282 vertices.\nAs the temperature is lowered, we indeed find the emergence of antiferromagnetic N\u00e9el order with signatures of\n\n\f4\n0.8\n\n60\n2\n\n50\n\nN2 = 64\n\n2\n\nN2 = 48\n\n0.6\n\n2\n\n40\n\nN2 = 32\n\n\u03c7 30\n\nN2 = 24\n\n2\n\n2\n\nN2 = 64\n\nCv 0.4\n\n2\n\nN2 = 16\n\n2\n\nN2 = 48\n\n2\n\nN2 = 32\n\n20\n\n2\n\nN2 = 24\n\n0.2\n\n10\n\n2\n\nN2 = 16\n\n0\n1.0\n\n2.0\n\n\u03b2\n\n3.0\n\nFIG. 3: Magnetic susceptibility \u03c7 = N2 (hm2 i \u2212 h|m|i2 ) of the\nIsing antiferromagnet coupled to annealed fat \u03c63 graphs with\nN2 = 162 up to N2 = 642 vertices.\n\n0\n\n1.0\n\nThe mechanism of the antiferromagnetic transition can\nbe understood from an inspection of the distribution P (q)\nof loop lengths: as the temperature is lowered, the Ising\nantiferromagnet forces all odd-length loops out of the system, leading to surfaces completely composed out of faces\nof even length, i.e., squares, hexagons, octagons etc., cf.\nFig. 5. Thus, the back-reaction of the antiferromagnetic\nmatter on the graphs drives them into a non-frustrating\nphase of bipartite graphs compatible with N\u00e9el order.\nThe resulting strong coupling between graphs and matter throughout the whole low-temperature region could\nplausibly give rise to a critical phase with associated\ninfinite-order phase transition as implied by the simulation results discussed above. This is in contrast to the\nIsing ferromagnet, where strong interaction between matter and geometry is confined to the vicinity of the critical\npoint.\n\n2.0\n\n3.0\n\nFIG. 4: Specific heat Cv = N2 \u03b2 2 (he2 i \u2212 hei2 ) of the Ising antiferromagnet coupled to annealed fat \u03c63 graphs from Monte\nCarlo simulations.\nB.\n\na phase transition at rather low temperatures \u03b2c \u2248 2.5,\ncf. the susceptibility data shown in Fig. 3.

We find the specific heat to be\ncompletely independent of system size with a broad peak\naround \u03b2 \u2248 1.4, cf. Fig. 4, and no crossing of the Binder\nparameter within the temperature range 0.1 \u2264 \u03b2 \u2264 4.0\nconsidered. These findings, together with the apparent\nscaling of the susceptibility on the low-temperature side\nof the peak seen in Fig. 3, hint at the presence of a critical\n(low-temperature) phase with an associated KosterlitzThouless phase transition41 . This conjecture is further\nsupported by the very slow convergence of effective critical temperatures as the system size is increased, compatible with a logarithmic rather than a power-law approach.\nA series of simulations for the ferromagnet on the same\nlattices performed for comparison, on the other hand,\nyields \u03b2c = 0.783(7), dh \u03bd = 3.3(2) and \u03b3/dh \u03bd = 0.68(3),\nperfectly compatible with the exact results24,25 .\n\n\u03b2\n\nQuenched average\n\nThe (graph-)quenched limit \u03c4graph \u226b \u03c4matter of averages describes the case usually encountered in condensed\nmatter physics, where impurities or lattice defects are\nfixed properties of the sample. Consequently, the average\nover disorder should be performed at the level of observable quantities, such as the free energy and its derivatives, leading to\nFquenched(\u03b2) = \u2212\u03b2 \u22121 hln Z(\u03b2, G)iG ,\n\n(5)\n\nThis interchange of logarithm and disorder average as\ncompared to the annealed limit of Eq. (2) often leads\nto dramatically different properties. Unfortunately, no\nexact prediction for ferromagnets in the spirit of (3) is\navailable here. Since it is believed that ferromagnets with\nweak quenched disorder in two dimensions in general are\nrelated to conformal field theories with central charge\nc = 0, an approximation starting from the KPZ/DDK\nframework could be derived from Eq. (3) by setting c = 0\nthere42 , i.e.,\n\u221a\n \u0303 = 1 ( 1 + 24\u2206 \u2212 1).\n\u2206\n4\n\n(6)\n\nThis form can also be more directly motivated by noting that the central charge of n replicas of matter variables is additive, such that the limit n \u2192 0 of the\nreplica trick naturally leads to a central charge c = 0\nin (3)43,44,45 . These predictions cannot be confronted\nwith any exact solutions. Monte Carlo simulations for\nthe Ising and Potts ferromagnets on quenched dynamical\ntriangulations14,46 show a change in universality class,\nin agreement with the adapted relevance criterion for\nconnectivity disorder discussed above12 . The critical exponents, however, although changed from their regularlattice values, in general seem not to be correctly predicted by the form (6).\nFor the antiferromagnets, frustration from quenched,\nfat graphs is potentially stronger than in the annealed\ncase: the frozen-in disorder of the graphs cannot adapt to\n\n\f5\n0.5\n0.4\n\nP(q)\n\nIII.\n\n\u03b2 = 0.1\n\u03b2 = 3.2\n\n0.3\n0.2\n0.1\n0\n0\n\n10\n\nq\n\n20\n\n30\n\nFIG. 5: Distribution P (q) of loop lengths of annealed, fat\n\u03c63 random graphs coupled to an Ising antiferromagnet in the\nhigh-temperature phase at \u03b2 = 0.1 and deep in the ordered\nphase at \u03b2 = 3.2. Data for graphs with N2 = 322 vertices.\n\nalleviate the energy cost of odd-length loops. As before,\nthe degree of frustration exerted on the Ising antiferromagnet depends on the ensemble of graphs considered:\n\u2022 Triangulations: Following the argumentation\npresented above, the system is paramagnetic at\nall temperatures for each fixed random triangulation. Consequently, the quenched average merely\ndescribes the modulation of a completely disordered system.\n\u2022 Quadrangulations: The perfect bipartiteness of\nthe graphs is not affected by the process of the disorder average. Via the described Mattis transformation, the system is identical to the Ising ferromagnet on quenched quadrangulations. By universality, the critical behaviour is expected to be that\nof the Ising ferromagnet on quenched fat \u03c63 graphs\nstudied in Ref. 14.\n\u2022 \u03c63 or \u03c64 graphs: This graph ensemble features\na broad distribution of odd-length loops exerting\nstrong frustration on the coupled antiferromagnet.\nThe lack of a back-reaction of the Ising spins on\nthe underlying graphs prevents the suppression of\nloops of odd length observed in the annealed limit.\nThe bipartite graph configurations selected in the\nlow-temperature phase of the latter only occur with\nvanishing weight in the quenched average. This\nappears to preclude the emergence of long-range\norder at finite temperatures. However, the frozenin frustration might give rise to spin-glass order at\nzero temperature.\nThe rest of this paper is devoted to an investigation\nof the possibility of such spin-glass order for the Ising\nantiferromagnet on quenched fat \u03c63 graphs.\n\nZERO-TEMPERATURE PHASE ON\nQUENCHED FAT GRAPHS\n\nDue to the random distribution of faces of odd (frustrated) and even (unfrustrated) lengths, it is natural to\nsuspect that the Ising antiferromagnet on \u03c63 fat graphs\nbehaves similarly to a \u00b1J Edwards-Anderson spin glass\non the same lattices. It is not a priori clear, however, whether the long-range correlation of co-ordination\nnumbers12 might cause any non-universal differences between these cases. How can the appearance of spin glass\nbe detected and its properties determined? Generalising\nPeierls' argument for the stability of an ordered phase,\na droplet-scaling theory for the spin-glass phase can be\nformulated47 . The role of the droplet surface (free) energy is then taken on by the width J(L) of the distribution of random couplings for a real-space renormalisation group decimation at length scale L. In the course of\nrenormalisation, J(L) scales as J(L) \u223c L\u03b8s , defining the\nspin stiffness exponent \u03b8s . If the system scales to weak\ncoupling, \u03b8s < 0, spin-glass order is unstable at finite\ntemperature and the system is below its lower critical dimension, with \u03b8s describing the properties of the critical\npoint at temperature T = 0. On the other hand, \u03b8s > 0\nindicates stability of a spin-glass phase at finite temperature. Numerically, the domain-wall free energy can be\ndetermined from the energy difference between ground\nstates of systems with different types of boundary conditions (BCs) chosen such as to induce a relative domain\nwall47 .\n\nA.\n\nMethod and droplet length scale\n\nFollowing this programme, one requires the generation of a number of statistically independent graph realisations for performing the quenched average. Subsequently, for each realisation ground states of the Ising\nantiferromagnet should be calculated. An ergodic set of\ngraph updates for dynamical triangulations (and the dual\n\u03c63 graphs) is given by the so-called Pachner moves23,48 ,\nwhich we employ to generate independent realisations of\ntoroidal topology, starting out from a perfect hexagonal lattice with periodic boundary conditions. Such a\ntoroidal shape is needed to induce excited states by a\nchange of boundary conditions as indicated above. The\nMonte Carlo equilibration is done for closed graphs, leaving the task of identifying appropriate loops along which\nto cut them open. Several possibilities come to mind:\n\u2022 In the original hexagonal lattice, the identification\nof boundaries is obvious. If, by construction, no\nlink-flip updates are performed on the links crossing\na boundary, the toroidal cuts are fixed in the equilibrated graphs. This simplicity, however, comes\nat the expense of strong boundary effects: due to\nthe large fractal dimension3 dh = 4, each vertex is\ncomparatively closer to one of the boundaries than\n\n\f6\nhomotopy\nfixed\n\nLmin\n\n20\n\n10\n\n4\n16\n\n2\n\n2\n\n32\n\n64\n\n2\n\n2\n\n128\n\n2\n\n256\n\nN2\nFIG. 6: On a planar graph, two interdigitating spanning trees\non the original and dual lattices touch or cross all links.\n\nwould be expected for a two-dimensional system.\n\u2022 Allowing flips of links crossing a boundary, one\nmight keep track of the induced evolution of the\nboundary loops. This turns out to be rather involved, in particular due to the appearance of selfintersections of the meandering boundary lines.\nConsequently, we have not considered this approach for the final ground-state computations.\n\u2022 Ideally, the graph generation should employ periodic boundary conditions preventing surface effects\nwith the graphs being \"cut open\" once equilibrated.\nThis amounts to the identification of topologically\ninequivalent elementary loops on the surface. It\nis not immediately obvious, however, how such an\noptimal homotopy basis could be computed for an\nintrinsic graph structure.\nAs it turns out, a number of computational problems\nrelated to topologically motivated cuttings of surfaces are\nNP -hard. In particular, identification of the so-called\n\"cut graph\" whose removal renders a surface topologically trivial, i.e., the locus of all points with at least\ntwo shortest paths from a given base point, is a nonpolynomial problem49 . Rather surprisingly, however, a\nhomotopy basis of minimum length in form of a system\nof loops joint in a common base point can be computed in\npolynomial time50 . Such a system consists of 2g simple\nloops (where g is the genus of the surface), whose complement in the manifold is a topological disk. This decomposition proceeds with a variant of the tree-cotree decomposition proposed in Ref. 51: starting from a marked\nbase point on a planar surface, the dual complement of\na spanning tree is a spanning tree as well, cf. Fig. 6. For\nnon-trivial topology, however, by Euler's formula both\ntrees simply do not have enough edges to cover the whole\ngraph, and it is easily seen that the edges not touched\nby either tree are those defining the topologically nontrivial loops with respect to the base point. A set of\nminimal loops can then be found by computing the tree\nT of shortest paths in the graph G and the maximum\nspanning tree T \u2217 in the complement (G \\ T )\u2217 , where the\n\nFIG. 7: Scaling of the average length hLmin i of the domain\nwall in the ferromagnet with antiperiodic boundary condi1/d\u2032\ntions together with fits of the form hLmin i = AN2 h . Note\nthe considerably larger scaling corrections for the graphs with\nfixed boundaries.\n\nweight of each dual edge e\u2217 is chosen to be the length of\nthe shortest loop in G containing the base point as well\nas the edge e. The desired basis is then given50 by the\nminimal loops defined by all edges e neither contained in\nT nor crossed by T \u2217 .\nExact ground states of the Ising system on the resulting graphs are computed in polynomial time via the\nmapping to a so-called minimum-weight perfect matching problem52 . Due to a limitation of this approach only\ntopologically planar graphs can be treated. Hence, after\ncutting the graph one of the resulting boundaries is left\nopen, while either periodic (P) or antiperiodic (AP) conditions are employed along the second boundary. The\ns\nscaling of the energy difference, h|\u2206E|P/AP i \u223c L\u03b8DW\n,\nthen gives access to the spin-stiffness exponent \u03b8s . In\ncontrast to the case of a regular lattice, where the relevant domain-wall length scale is simply equivalent to the\nlength of the boundary, LDW \u223c L, the corresponding\nscale is not immediately obvious for the fractal graphs\nat hand. It can be found, however, from the groundstate problem of the ferromagnet : if AP boundary conditions are applied along one direction, the system responds with a domain wall of minimum length Lmin, corresponding to the length scale of the applied perturbation. The corresponding average length hLmin i is shown\nin Fig. 7 for 5 000 graph replicas with N2 \u2264 2562 . Here,\nh*i denotes an average over disorder. Fits of the form\n1/d\u2032\nhLmin i = AL N2 h yield d\u2032h = 4.0161(91) for the fixed\nboundaries resp. d\u2032h = 4.0513(72) for the homotopy basis, implying that in fact d\u2032h = dh = 4, and the relevant domain-wall length scale is equivalent to the intrin1/d\nsic length Leff \u223c N2 h of the fractal graphs, implying\n\u03b8s /dh\nh|\u2206E|P/AP i \u223c N2\n.

As for the\nhoneycomb lattice, the Gaussian spin glass shows clear\nscaling h|\u2206E|P/AP i \u2192 0, with an estimated \u03b8s /dh =\n\u22120.0684(25), different from the ordered lattice case, but\nalso not quite compatible with the prediction of the\nquenched approximation (6). The \u00b1J spin glass as\nwell as the antiferromagnet show saturation behaviour\nimplying \u03b8s /dh = 0 with E0 = 0.599(23) (\u00b1J) and\nE0 = 0.472(44) (antiferromagnet), in agreement with the\nquenched KPZ prediction. In fact, also the finite-size approach is very similar between these two cases, with essentially only the correction amplitude SE differing, cf.\nFig. 8. This clearly supports the view that, on the planar random graphs considered here, the antiferromagnet\nshows zero-temperature spin-glass behaviour in the universality class of the \u00b1J model, in contrast to regular\nlattices, where the antiferromagnet does not behave like\na spin glass38 .\n\nC.\nB.\n\nSpin-stiffness exponent\n\nTo determine the spin-stiffness exponent \u03b8s , groundstate computations were performed for a series of graph\nsizes, comparing the ground-state energies for P and AP\nboundaries, using 5 000 disorder replica for each size.\nSince previous work has almost exclusively focused on the\nsquare lattice54 , as a benchmark and universality test we\nfirst considered the case of the regular honeycomb lattice,\nperforming fits of the form h|\u2206E|P/AP i = E0 + SE L\u03b8s\nfor L = 16, 24, . . ., 256. For a Gaussian distribution of\nthe couplings Jij of (1), we arrive at E0 = 0.0026(261),\nclearly indicating that asymptotically E0 = 0 as expected. Fixing E0 = 0 then yields \u03b8s = \u22120.2843(44) with\nquality-of-fit Q = 0.29. This is in excellent agreement\nwith results for the square lattice54 , the negative value\nof \u03b8s indicating that spin-glass order is confined to zero\ntemperature in this system. For symmetric, bimodal couplings Jij = \u00b1J, on the other hand, a clear saturation of\ndefect energies is observed, resulting in E0 = 0.991(15),\nleading to a vanishing \u03b8s = 0 of the effective spin-stiffness\nexponent. This is again in agreement with the squarelattice result, showing that the \u00b1J spin glass is marginal\nin two dimensions (but it turns out that, in fact, Tg = 0\nthere)54 , see also Refs. 55,56,57.\nAlthough the quenched approximation (6) to the KPZ\n\nDomain-wall fractal dimension\n\nIt has been known for some time that domain walls\nin spin glasses are fractal curves54,58 . Recently, evidence\nhas been presented that in two dimensions they are in fact\nin agreement with the excursions known as \"stochastic\nLoewner evolution\" (SLE), which are closely related with\nunitary conformal field theories59,60 . It is interesting to\nmeasure the fractal behaviour of domain walls on random\ngraphs which are fractals themselves. Considering the\nP\n(P ) (P ) (AP ) (AP )\nfor P/AP\nsj\nlink overlap ql = N11 hi,ji si sj si\nboundaries, it is clear that for Ising spins bonds crossed\nby a domain wall contribute \u22121 to ql , whereas all other\nbonds contribute +1 (N1 denotes the number of links of\nthe graph).

(Here,\nthe smallest lattice sizes with L \u2264 32 have been omitted from the fit to account for scaling corrections not\nexplicitly taken into account.)

Only\nfor the special case of bipartite random lattices without\nodd-length loops such as dynamical quadrangulations,\ndoes a Mattis transformation identically relate the antiferromagnet to the ferromagnet. The annealed randomgraph average considered in quantum gravity allows the\nlattice to dynamically alleviate frustration, leading, for\ninstance, to the emergence of a N\u00e9el ordered phase for\nthe \u03c63 and \u03c64 antiferromagnet, apparently accompanied\nby a Kosterlitz-Thouless phase transition (although, of\ncourse, it is not proven that this transition survives in the\nthermodynamic limit). Quenching the graphs, such dynamical adaptation is precluded, moving the phase transition to zero temperature, where instead a spin-glass\nphase appears. From an exact defect-wall calculation, it\nappears that this spin glass is in the same universality\nclass as the \u00b1J model on the same lattice. The wealth\nof these observed effects crucially depends on the locality (or finite dimensionality) of the considered surfaces,\nthus avoiding the possibly less interesting mean-field behaviour induced by more generic random graphs.\nAcknowledgements\n\nThis work was partially supported by the EC RTNNetwork 'ENRAGE': Random Geometry and Random\nMatrices: From Quantum Gravity to Econophysics under grant No. MRTN-CT-2004-005616.
