Introduction.\nIn their paper [BB], Babson and Benjamini introduce a parameter CG for an infinite\nCayley graph G in the following way. Let G+ be the set of vertices in G together with the\nset of ends of G. Given a subset Y in V (G) \u222a E(G), let\nC(Y ) =\n\nsup\nY1 \u222aY2 =Y\n\n{dist(Y1 , Y2 )}.\n\nIf C(Y ) \u2264 t, then Y is said to be t-close. Let\nCG = sup C(\u03a0),\nwhere \u03a0 ranges over all minimal cutsets between points x, y \u2208 G+ .\nFor example, it is easy to check that for the square-grid we have CZ2 = 2, while\nCG = 3 for the hexagonal grid G. The so called lamplighter group will turn out to be such\nthat its CG is infinity (see Section 4).\n2000 Mathematics Subject Classification. Primary 05C25. Secondary 20F65.\nKey words and phrases. Cutsets, quasi-isometry.\nResearch partially supported by NSF Grant DMS-0231224 and Hungarian National Foundation for Scientific Research Grants TO34475.\n\n1\n\n\fAn exponential bound on the number of minimal cutsets of size n provides one with a\nnontrivial upper bound on the percolation critical probability pc of G. Moreover, if CG is\nbounded for some one-ended graph G then the critical probability pu for having a unique\ninfinite cluster is smaller than 1, as shown in [BB]. There it is also shown that for finitely\npresented groups G (i.e., groups with finitely many defining relators) CG is finite. We\nshall give a shorter and elementary proof for that in Section 5. This established positively\nQuestion 3 in [BS] for finitely presented groups, showing that a finitely group with one\nend has pu < 1. The original question, whether pu is smaller than 1 in finitely generated\ngroups with one end is still open, so it is natural to ask whether CG is finite for any Cayley\ngraph G.\nAt the end of [BB] there are three questions:\nQuestion 1: Does having some exponential bound on the number of minimal cutsets\nof size n in a Cayley graph depend only on the group and not on the choice of generators?\nQuestion 2: Does the property \"CG is finite\" for a Cayley graph depend only on the\ngroup and not on the choice of generators?\nQuestion 3: Are there finitely generated groups with one end so that CG is not finite?\nIn Section 2 and Section 3 we give positive answers to the first and the second question\nof [BB] respectively. In both cases we prove the invariance not only for different Cayley\ngraphs of the same group, but for any two graphs that have bounded degrees and that are\nquasi-isometric under a bijection. Similar, but lengthier, arguments would show that the\nsame conclusions hold for any two quasi-isometric bounded degree graphs.\nIn Section 4 we show that the lamplighter group is an example of a group with one\nend and infinite CG , hence answering Question 3 negatively.\nBabson and Benjamini conjecture that for any Cayley graph the number of minimal\ncutsets separating a fixed vertex o from infinity is exponentially bounded in the size of the\ncutset. They prove it for finitely presented groups. Problem VI.19 from [dlH] is weaker:\n\"In a finitely-generated group which is not almost cyclic, does the size of spheres tend to\ninfinity?\" (A group is almost cyclic if it is a finite extension of Z.) We give a short proof in\nSection 6 for that the sizes of any sequence of (distinct) cutsets tend to infinity. This have\nalready been shown by Anna Erschler (see the appendix of the second edition of [dlH]),\nusing a result of Coulhon and Saloff-Coste ([CS]).\nFor any set X of vertices of a graph we denote by Nn (X) the n-neighborhood of X,\nthat is, the set of points at distance \u2264 n from X in the graph. Note that although Nn (X)\nwill be used for different graphs, it is the set X that indicates which graph is understood.\nIn what follows, for simpler phrasing, cutset will always mean a set of edges whose\ndeletion disconnects the graph. Everything remains valid if we use cutsets consisting of\n2\n\n\fvertices.\nWe do not always distinguish between vertex sets and subgraphs induced by them.\nA bijective quasi-isometry (or bi-Lipschitz map) with constant m between the graphs\nG = (V, E) and G\u2032 = (V \u2032 , E \u2032 ), is a bijection f from V (G) to V (G\u2032 ) such that the following\nholds:\nFor any x, y \u2208 V (G),\n1/m * distG (x, y) \u2264 distG\u2032 (f (x), f (y)) \u2264 m * distG (x, y)\n.\nIf there is such a map between G and G\u2032 , we shall say that they are bijectively quasiisometric. Note that different Cayley graphs of the same group are always bijectively\nquasi-isometric.\nGiven a subset X of G, \u2202X will denote its external boundary, that is, the set of\nvertices not in X but adjacent to some vertex of X. We use \u2202i X for the inner boundary.\n\n\u00a72. The invariance of exponential bound.\nGiven a graph G and o \u2208 V (G), we say that there is an exponential bound for the\nnumber of minimal cutsets separating o from infinity if there is a constant \u03b1 such that the\nnumber of minimal cutsets of size n separating o from infinity is at most \u03b1n .\nIn this section we prove that having an exponential bound for the number of minimal\ncutsets in o is invariant under bijective quasi-isometries.\nWe shall need the following lemma, which is basically Lemma 6 in [BB]; a stronger\nbound is given in [Ke].\nLemma 2.1. Let G be a graph of degrees at most d and o a fixed vertex of it. The number\nof subsets of vertices of size n that contain o and induce a connected subgraph in G is at\nmost d2n .\nProof. Choose a spanning tree in an induced subgraph as above and define a \"depth-first\nwalk\" in it: a walk that visits every vertex and goes through each edge at most twice. The\nwalk determines the set of vertices, it has length \u2264 2n, and in each step there are at most\nd ways to continue such a walk.\nTheorem 2.2. Let \u03b9 be a bijective quasi-isometry from a graph G to G\u2032 with constant m.\nSuppose that the degrees in G and G\u2032 are bounded by d. Let o be some fixed vertex of G.\nThen there is an exponential bound for the number of minimal cutsets in G separating o\n3\n\n\ffrom infinity if and only if there is an exponential bound in G\u2032 for the number of cutsets\nseparating \u03b9(o) from infinity.\nProof. Denote by Cn and Cn\u2032 the set of minimal cutsets of size n separating o and o\u2032 := \u03b9(o)\nfrom infinity in G and G\u2032 respectively. Let Kn (Kn\u2032 ) be the set of connected subgraphs\nthat arise as the connected component containing o (o\u2032 ) after removing an element of Cn\nSnd2m\n(Cn\u2032 ) from G (G\u2032 ). We shall define a map \u03c6 from Kn to Hn := j=1 Kj\u2032 . The map \u03c6\nwill have the property that for every \u03c7 \u2208 Hn the set {\u03ba \u2208 Kn : \u03c6(\u03ba) = \u03c7} has at most\ncn elements for some constant c independent of n. The existence of \u03c6 shows that if |Kn\u2032 |\n(and hence |Hn |) is at most exponential, then |Kn | \u2264 |Hn |cn is also at most exponential.\nHence the theorem will follow.\nSo, let \u03ba be an element in Kn . Define \u03c6(\u03ba) to be Nm (\u03b9(\u03ba)). If x, y \u2208 V (\u03ba) are adjacent\nin G then there is a path of length \u2264 m in G\u2032 between \u03b9(x) and \u03b9(y). So the vertices of \u03b9(\u03ba)\nare in one component of \u03c6(\u03ba), and since any other vertex in \u03c6(\u03ba) is in the same component\nof \u03c6(\u03ba) as some vertex of \u03b9(\u03ba), we see that \u03c6(\u03ba) is connected. Now \u03c6(\u03ba) contains o\u2032 .\nMoreover, for any (external) boundary vertex y of \u03b9(\u03ba) in G\u2032 , \u03b9\u22121 (y) is at distance at most\nm from a boundary vertex of \u03ba in G. The set of vertices that are at distance \u2264 m from\n\u2202\u03ba in G have cardinality \u2264 dm |\u2202\u03ba|, so we get that |\u2202\u03b9(\u03ba)| \u2264 dm |\u2202\u03ba|. Since \u03c6(\u03ba) is the\nm-neighborhood of \u03b9(\u03ba) in G\u2032 , the boundary of \u03c6(\u03ba) is in the m-neighborhood of \u2202\u03b9(\u03ba) in\nG\u2032 , so |\u2202\u03c6(\u03ba)| \u2264 dm |\u2202\u03b9(\u03ba)|. We get |\u2202\u03c6(\u03ba)| \u2264 d2m |\u2202\u03ba| from these two inequalities. Hence\n\u03c6(\u03ba) is indeed in Hn .\nWhat remains to be shown is that |{\u03ba \u2208 Kn : \u03c6(\u03ba) = \u03c7}| \u2264 cn for any \u03c7 \u2208 Hn .\nFix \u03c7 \u2208 Hn and let \u03c4 := \u03b9\u22121 (\u03c7). If \u03c6(\u03ba) = \u03c7 for some \u03ba \u2208 Kn then \u03ba \u2282 \u03c4 . Furthermore, the m2 -neighborhood of \u03ba in G contains \u03c4 (by Nm (\u03b9(\u03ba)) = \u03c7 and the definition of\n2\n2\nm). Thus \u03c4 \\ \u03ba is contained in Nm2 (\u2202\u03ba). Since Nm2 (\u2202\u03ba) has \u2264 dm |\u2202\u03ba| = dm n elements,\n2\n\n|\u03c4 \\ \u03ba| \u2264 dm n. Now G \\ \u03ba has only infinite connected components by minimality of the\n2\ncutsets. Hence we can get \u03ba from \u03c4 by removing a subgraph S of \u03c4 of size \u2264 dm n and\nsuch that any connected component of S contains some element of \u2202i \u03c4 . It thus suffices to\nshow that there is an exponential bound on the number of such S's.\n2\n\nSo let S be the set of subgraphs of \u03c4 of size \u2264 dm n with the property that each\ncomponent contains a vertex of \u2202i \u03c4 . Any element S of S can be described as follows.\nLet S1 , . . . , Sk be the components of S and fix an element ri of \u2202i \u03c4 in Si for each\ni; let R := {r1 , . . . , rk }. Now, if we first choose R as a subset of \u2202i \u03c4 , then choose the\nsizes of the Si , and finally choose the actual subgraphs Si of \u03c4 of the given sizes and each\nincident to the corresponding element of R, then we obtain any possible S \u2208 S. One can\n2\nm2\nchoose R as a subset of \u2202i \u03c4 (where |\u2202i \u03c4 | \u2264 dm n), in at most 2d n ways. Once we have\n4\n\n\fPk\n2\n{r1 , . . . , rk } = R, we choose |Si | for each i so that i=1 |Si | \u2264 dm n (by the definition of\nm2 \u0001\nm2\nS). This can be done in at most d k n \u2264 2d n ways. Finally, we choose the particular\nm2\n\nSi 's, knowing their sizes. By Lemma 2.1, there are at most d2(|S1 |+...+|Sk |) \u2264 d2d\n\nn\n\nways\n\nto do so.\nm2\nm2\nm2\nm2\nWe got that there are \u2264 2d n * 2d n * d2d n = (4d2 )d n ways to choose S, thus |S|\nis exponentially bounded. This finishes the proof.\n\n\u00a73. The invariance of finiteness of CG .\nIn this section we show that if CG is infinite for a graph G, then CG\u2032 is infinite for any\ngraph G\u2032 that is bijectively quasi-isometric to G. This means that the answer to Question\n2 of [BB] is positive.\nNote that a minimal cutset \u03a0 between two vertices x and y is also a minimal cutset\nbetween one of them and an end. Otherwise there are paths from x and from y to an end\nthat do not intersect \u03a0, and these could be used (by the definition of ends) to find a path\nbetween x and y that does not intersect \u03a0, giving a contradiction. Hence the supremum\nin the definition of CG remains the same with the extra hypothesis that y is in G+ \\ G.\nConsider a minimal cutset that separates a finite subgraph X from infinity, and any\nboundary vertex v of X. There is an infinite path starting from v and going to infinity\nwithout intersecting X in any point other than v, since any component of G \\ X is infinite\nby minimality.\nLemma 3.1. Suppose that a minimal cutset S that separates the connected subgraph X of\nG from \u03be \u2208 G+ \\ G is not l-close. Then the set Sn of edges that separate Nn (X) from \u03be is\na minimal cutset that is not (l \u2212 2n)-close.\nProof. We may assume that l \u2265 2n. Let A and B partition S so that dist(A, B) > l. Then\nwe have Nn (A) \u2229 Nn (B) = \u2205. The set of vertices in Nn (X) that are incident to some edge\nin Sn is in Nn (A) \u222a Nn (B), and it has nonempty intersection with both Nn (A) and Nn (B)\nbecause of our condition about the paths. Hence the partition generated on Sn by Nn (A)\nand Nn (B) shows that it is not (l \u2212 2n)-close.\nTheorem 3.2. Suppose that CG is infinite for the graph G. Then CG\u2032 is infinite for any\ngraph G\u2032 that is bijectively quasi-isometric to G.\nProof. Let \u03b9 : V (G) \u2192 V (G\u2032 ) be a bijective quasi-isometry with constant m. For each k,\nlet Gk be a connected subgraph in G whose boundary is not k-close, and such that from\nany point of \u2202Gk there is a path to infinity not intersecting Gk . Such subgraphs exist\n5\n\n\fby our assumption on G and the remark about the definition of CG . As in the previous\nsection, the m-neighborhood Nm (\u03b9(Gk )) is connected. This implies that the set Sk of\nedges that separate Nm (\u03b9(Gk )) from infinity is a minimal cutset. By Lemma 3.1, Sk is not\n(k/m \u2212 2m)-close. So the Sk 's provide us with a sequence of minimal cutsets where the\ndistances for certain partitions tend to infinity. This shows that CG\u2032 is infinite.\nRemark. The assumption that G and G\u2032 are bijectively quasi-isometric was not necessary\nin the last two sections. Basically similar arguments show that the conclusions remain true\nfor any two quasi-isometric bounded degree graphs.\n\n\u00a74. The lamplighter group has infinite CG .\nIn this section we answer Question 3 in [BB].\nP\nThe lamplighter group is defined as the semidirect product of Z with x\u2208Z Z2 . For\nP\nelements p1 , p2 \u2208 Z and l1 , l2 \u2208 x\u2208Z Z2 , the product is defined as\n(p1 , l1 )(p2 , l2 ) := (p1 + p2 , l1 \u2295 S \u2212m1 l2 ),\nwhere S is the left shift, S(l)(i) = l(i + 1) and \u2295 is componentwise addition mod 2. One\ncan think of the elements of the lamplighter group as configurations where at each integer\nthere is a lamp, either switched on or off, and there is a lamplighter standing at one of the\nintegers. A possible set of generators is {(1, \u03c9), (0, \u03bb)}, where \u03c9 stands for the sequence\nof all zeros, and \u03bb for the sequence of all zeros but a 1 in the 0'th position. The first\ngenerator corresponds to that the lamplighter moves one step to the right, and the second\none to that he switches the lamp in his current position.\nTheorem 4.1. If G is a Cayley graph of the lamplighter group then CG is infinite.\nThe Diestel-Leader graph DL(k, n) is constructed as follows. Let T and T \u2032 be a k + 1regular and an n + 1-regular tree respectively, and suppose that they are rooted at infinity\nso that their vertices are arranged into levels corresponding to the integers. Do it so that\na vertex of T on the i'th level has k children on the i + 1'th level and the parent on the\ni \u2212 1'th level; a vertex of T \u2032 on the i'th level has n children on the i \u2212 1'th level and the\nparent on the i + 1'th level. Let the level of v in T (resp. T \u2032 ) be denoted by lT (v) (resp.\nlT \u2032 (v)). DL(k, n) is defined on the vertex set {(x, x\u2032 ) \u2208 V (T ) \u00d7 V (T \u2032 ) : lT (x) = lT \u2032 (x\u2032 )}.\nThere is an edge between (x, x\u2032 ) and (y, y \u2032) iff x and y are connected in T and x\u2032 and y \u2032\nare connected in T \u2032 .\nIt is well known that DL(2, 2) is isomorphic to a Cayley graph of the lamplighter\ngroup. Briefly, fix a biinfinite path R in T and a biinfinite path R\u2032 in T \u2032 so that these\n6\n\n\fpaths intersect each level in exactly one vertex. For each vertex in T and T \u2032 , call the edge\nthat goes to one of its children a 0-edge, and the other one a 1-edge. Do it so that the\npaths R and R\u2032 contain only 0-edges. Now, the level of a vertex (x, x\u2032 ) in DL(2, 2) is the\nposition of the lamplighter, and what the lamplighter sees on his left (right), is just the\nsequence of 0's and 1's on the edges of the infinite path connecting x (x\u2032 ) to the root in\ninfinity in T (T \u2032 ), meaning the infinite path that always goes towards parents. For more\ndetails, see [Wo2].\nFix a vertex o on the 0'th level of T and a vertex o\u2032 on the k'th level of T \u2032 . Let the\nsubtree Fk (Fk\u2032 ) consist of the offspring of o (o\u2032 ) of distance at most k from it. Let Hk\nbe the subgraph {(x, x\u2032 ) : x \u2208 Fk , x\u2032 \u2208 Fk\u2032 } in DL(2, 2) and Ck be the set of its boundary\nedges. Notice that Ck is a minimal cutset and that it is the disjoint union of edges incident\nto Ak = {(x, x\u2032 ) : degFk (x) = 1} and Bk = {(x, x\u2032 ) : degFk (x\u2032 ) = 1} respectively. The\ndistance of Ak and Bk is obviously k. Hence the sequence Ck shows that CDL(2,2) is\ninfinite.\n\n\u00a75. CG in finitely presented groups.\nThe result in this section is the key in [BB] to proving pu < 1 for finitely presented\ngroups with one end. We present a shorter proof here, using elementary arguments and\nterminology, as opposed to their argument using cohomology groups.\nWe use the obvious correspondence between subsets of E(G) and the elements of\n{0, 1}E(G) regarded as vectors, where mod 2 addition on these later corresponds to symmetric differences in the case of the subsets. Given a set K of cycles in a graph G, we say\nthat a cycle C in G is generated by K if C can be written as a mod 2 sum of cycles from K.\nNote that any cycle in a Cayley graph of a finitely presented group is generated by the set\nof cycles of length at most t, where t is the maximal length of relators in this presentation\nof the group.\nTheorem 5.1. Let G be a graph such that any cycle is generated by a set K of cycles in\nG. Suppose that any cycle in K has length at most t. Let \u03a0 be a minimal cutset separating\na vertex x from y \u2208 V (G) \u222a {\u221e}. Then for any nontrivial partition \u03a01 \u222a \u03a02 of \u03a0 there\nare vertices xi \u2208 \u03a0i (i = 1, 2) such that dist(x1 , x2 ) \u2264 t/2. I.e., CG \u2264 t/2.\nProof. It is enough to show that there is a cycle in K that intersects both \u03a01 and \u03a02 .\nBy minimality of the cutset \u03a0, there are paths Pi between x and y, i = 1, 2, such that\nPi does not intersect \u03a03\u2212i . We may write P1 \u2212 P2 as a mod 2 sum of cycles from K:\nP\nP1 \u2212 P2 = c\u2208K \u2032 c, for a certain K \u2032 \u2282 K. Let K1\u2032 be the set of those cycles in K \u2032 that\n7\n\n\fintersect \u03a01 , and K2\u2032 := K \u2032 \\ K1\u2032 . Define\nX\nX\nc.\nc = P2 +\n\u03b8 := P1 \u2212\nc\u2208K2\u2032\n\nc\u2208K1\u2032\n\nThe right hand side is the sum of cycles and paths that do not intersect \u03a01 , hence \u03b8 does\nnot contain any edge of \u03a01 . On the other hand, since the only odd degrees that \u03b8 has are\nin x and y, these two have to be in the same connected component of \u03b8. Thus, there is a\npath from x to y that intersects \u03a02 . Since P1 does not, we deduce that some cycle in K1\u2032\ndoes. This cycle intersects both \u03a01 and \u03a02 .\n\n\u00a76. Sizes of cutsets tend to infinity.\nBy the growth of a Cayley graph we mean the function that takes in n the size of a\nball of radius n.\nFor a rooted tree T and x \u2208 V (T ) let the subtree Tx be defined as the set of all\ndescendants of x (including x itself) and the edges induced by them.\nA lexicographically minimal spanning tree T of a Cayley graph G is a subtree rooted at\nthe origin and defined in the following way. Fix a linear ordering of the generators of G and\ntheir inverses. For any vertex v of the Cayley graph choose the word representing v that\nis lexicographically minimal among all such words. There is a path in G that represents\nthis word; define T to be the union of all these paths (as v ranges through every vertex).\nThe graph we get is indeed a spanning tree. Moreover, it is subperiodic, that is, for any\nx in V (T ) there is an embedding of Tx into T that maps x to o. The growth rates of T\nand G are the same. These are straightforward corollaries of the definition of T ; for more\ndetails about lexicographically minimal spanning trees, see, for example, [LP].\nLemma 6.1. If a subperiodic tree T has finitely many infinite rays then it has linear growth.\nProof. For x \u2208 V (G) denote by Fx the union of the finite components of T \\ {x} not\ncontaining o. Define S := {x \u2208 V (T ) : |Fx | > |Fy | for every y where dist(o, y) < dist(o, x)}.\nBy subperiodicity of T , for any x \u2208 V (T ) there is an embedding \u03c6 of Tx into T such that\n\u03c6(x) = o. Fix x 6= o and a corresponding \u03c6. If z \u2208 S \u2229 Tx then \u03c6(Fz ) can not be a subset\nof F\u03c6(z) by the definition of S. So \u03c6(Fz ) has the property that some of its vertices are\nmapped into vertices of an infinite ray starting from \u03c6(z) and not intersecting o. This\ninfinite ray contains no other vertices from \u03c6(Tx ) but those few from \u03c6(Fz ). So there are\nat most as many different \"Fz 's\" as pairwise disjoint infinite rays, that is, |S \u2229 Tx | is finite.\nThis can hold for any x 6= o iff |S| is finite. Hence |Fx | is bounded for every x, and T has\nlinear growth.\n8\n\n\fTheorem 6.2. In any Cayley-graph G and for n > 0, there are only finitely many cutsets\nof size n separating a fixed vertex o from infinity, unless G is a finite extension of Z.\nProof. Let Sr stand for the sphere of radius r around o; Br for the ball. By a cutset we\nalways mean a cutset separating o from infinity.\nIf G has infinitely many ends then it is nonamenable and has an exponential bound\nfor the number of minimal cutsets of size n by Lemma 2.1, as shown in [BB]. So we may\nassume that G has one end. Fix n > 0. Choose a lexicographically minimal spanning tree\nT in G. If T has finitely many ends then the group grows linearly by Lemma 6.1. Hence it\nis a finite extension of Z. (For a proof of that groups of linear growth are finite extensions\nof Z, see, for example, Corollary 3.18 in [Wo1].) If T has infinitely many ends then there\nis a ball around o such that any minimal cutset of size n intersects it, namely a ball such\nthat there are at least n + 1 disjoint infinite rays starting from its boundary. Choose X\nto be a set of edges that occurs in infinitely many minimal cutsets of size n (to prove by\ncontradiction), and maximal with this property. (So 0 < |X| < n.) Since X is not a cutset\nand G has one end, there are numbers R and r such that any vertex in Sr is connected to\no by a path in G \\ X and not intersecting SR . But then a cutset that has no edge in BR\nbut those of X cannot be minimal (it is necessarily a cutset without X too). This shows,\nby the choice of X, that there cannot be infinitely many minimal cutsets of size n and\ncontaining X. This contradiction finishes the proof.\nAcknowledgements.
