This is used in semiondu tor superlatti es4,6\u001511 , in whi h the system is a\nheterostru ture with dots, rods or layers of a semi ondu tor material arranged periodi ally in a matrix of another\nmaterial. If the period of the superlatti e ex eeds substantially that of the rystal latti e, the envelope fun tion\napproximation is appli able. In this ase, the paraboli\nondu tion band bottom and valen e band top are assumed to be split into a number of energy minibands.\nIn Ald Ga1\u2212d As, an alloy of zin blende stru ture, the\nvalen e band top is omposed of bands of light and heavy\nholes, in whi h the spin degenera y is lifted for ertain\nnonzero wave ve tors (kz 6= 0). Thus, the stru ture of\nminibands within the valen e band is rather omplex12 .\nSin e the values of e\u001be tive mass of light and heavy holes\nare relatively high ompared to those of ele trons, minibands and minigaps in the valen e band are mu h narrower than the gap between the ondu tion band and the\nvalen e band. The stru ture of minibands in the ondu tion band is more transparent be ause of the o urren e\nof only one ele troni band (in a monolithi material)\nsplit into relatively large minigaps and minibands in the\nsuperlatti e.\nFor typi al values of latti e onstant of the superlatti e\nthe lowest ondu tion miniband, lying below the matrix\nmaterial potential (i.e. in the potential well generated\nby the dots or rods), is well deta hed from the higher\n\nminibands, whi h tend to overlap. In our estimation of\nsolar ell e\u001e ien y the lowest ondu tion miniband is assumed to a t as an intermediate band (IB), while the\nminibands in the ondu tion band (CB) above it, as well\nas the valen e band (VB) as a whole, form ontinuous\nblo ks. The ultimate e\u001e ien y determined in this study\nrefers to this type of band stru ture. The ultimate ef\u001c ien y re\u001de ts how the band stru ture of the solar ell\nmat hes the solar spe trum, with inevitable losses in the\nonversion of light quanta into ele tri ity due to the inomplete absorption of photons (quanta of energy below\nthe width of the narrowest bandgap are not absorbed in\nthe system) and thermalization pro esses (a part of energy of photons above the bandgap width is dissipated in\nthermal onta t with the latti e).\nThe obje tive of this study is to determine the ele troni and hole spe tra for an isolated array of ylindri al\nquantum dots arranged in a hexagonal latti e. We investigate the superlatti e spe trum versus the quantum dot\nlayer thi kness (the height of the ylindri al dots). Next,\nwe al ulate the ultimate e\u001e ien y of a solar ell based\non the onsidered stru ture and examine its dependen e\non the quantum dot layer thi kness.\nThe paper is organized as follows. After this Introdu tion we dis uss the geometry of a 3D superlatti e of ylindri al dot arrays.

The spe tra shown in Fig. 2a\nand b orrespond to systems with relatively thi k spa er\nlayers (2h1 = 100\u00c5), whi h implies the dot layers are isolated from one another. In this ase ele trons are bound\nwithin the layer and only allowed to propagate in the x\u2212y\nplane. Along the paths \u0393 \u2212 A, K \u2212 H and M \u2212 L (propagation in the z dire tion) the relation E(k) is nondispersive due to the restri tion (binding) of the ele tron motion in the layer. Dispersion only o urs when the ele tron energy ex eeds the barrier generated by the spa er\n(the barrier level is represented as a horizontal dashed\n\nFigure 2. The ele troni spe tra of the system presented in\nFig. 1, with GaAs rods (material A) and Al0.35 Ga0.65 As matrix (material B), for \u001clling fra tion f = 0.3 and latti e onstant a = 50 \u00c5 in the quantum dot layers. The spe tra in (a)\nand (b) orrespond to a system with almost isolated layers\n(spa er width 2h1 = 100\u00c5). The dispersive bran hes orresponding to the propagation along the rod axis are \u001dat below\nthe barriers in spa ers (made of AlAs, material C). The higher\nnumber of modes resulting from a denser quantization along\nthe rod axis (for longer rods, (b)) auses minigaps to lose.\nThe limit of in\u001cnite rods ( ) is approa hed by using long rods\nand thin spa ers (2h1 = 0.2\u00c5). The paraboli dispersion relation is seen to fold in the \u001crst BZ for free motion along the\nrod axis. Red dashed line represents the dispersion relation\nin the 2D rod array model (when the motion along z-axis is\nnot in luded.\n\nline in Fig. 2). In a single isolated layer the ele tron motion in the layer plane (the x\u2212y plane) and that in the dire tion perpendi ular to it (the z dire tion) are nearly independent, as a onsequen e of the separability of the effe tive potential15 : EC (x, y, z) = EC,x\u2212y (x, y) + EC,z (z)\n\n\f4\n(a stri t separation of variables in (1) requires the separation of variables also in the inverse e\u001be tive mass16 ).\nHen e, the total ele tron energy is, approximately, the\nsum of the energy Ex\u2212y of the ele tron motion in the 2D\nperiodi potential in the layer and the energy Ez of the\nele tron motion bound in a 1D well of width equal to the\nlayer thi kness. This is illustrated in Fig. 2, in whi h\nindividual minibands are seen to form through a shift of\nminibands (represented as red dashed lines) orresponding to the motion in the 2D potential EC,x\u2212y in the layer\nby the energy levels in the 1D potential well EC,z (z) ( orresponding to the position of non-dispersive minibands\non the path \u0393 \u2212 A, where kz 6= 0 and kx\u2212y = 0). The effe t is illustrated in Fig. 2b, in whi h the shift of the \u001crst\nand the se ond 2D minibands is indi ated by dashed and\ndotted arrows, respe tively; solid arrows indi ate the energy levels Ez orresponding to the non-dispersive minibands on the path \u0393 \u2212 A.\nThe spe tra presented in Fig. 2a and b orrespond to\nstru tures of di\u001berent quantum dot array thi kness. As\nthe height of dots in reases, the number of bound states\nin the system grows as well. This translates into an inreased number of minibands, and their denser overage\nof the same energy range. As a result, for dot arrays thi k\nenough (Fig. 2b) all the ele troni minibands, in luding\nthe lowest one, form a ontinuous blo k. For the onsidered stru ture to provide a basis of a high-e\u001e ien y solar\nell, the dot array thi kness should be limited so that the\nminigaps do not lose.\nFigure 2 shows the superlatti e spe trum for strongly\nintera ting dot arrays. As the spa ers are very thin\n(2h1 = 0.2\u00c5), the system an be regarded, with quite\ngood approximation, as a superlatti e with ylindri al\nrods of in\u001cnite length. In a 2D e\u001be tive potential generated by this type of stru ture the ele tron motion along\nthe z dire tion is free. This is eviden ed by the paraboli\ndispersion relation along paths \u0393 \u2212 A, K \u2212 H and L \u2212 M,\narti\u001c ially folded to the \u001crst BZ. In an unfolded BZ the\nminiband stru ture for kz = 0 will be identi al with that\nof the 2D superlatti e (red dashed line).\nIn order to estimate the ultimate e\u001e ien y of the solar\nell we must know the distan e EI between the bottom\nof the intermediate band (the \u001crst ondu tion miniband)\nand the bottom of the ondu tion band (the ontinuum\nformed by the minibands above the matrix potential), as\nwell as the gap EG between the valen e band and the\nondu tion band (see Fig. 2a). We have determined\nboth by investigating the position of absolute minigaps\nand minibands versus dot array thi kness h2 (see Fig.\n3a). The al ulations were performed for large spa er\nthi kness, 2h1 = 100\u00c5, ensuring a su\u001e ient isolation of\nthe quantum dot arrays. The resulting plot of ultimate\ne\u001e ien y versus dot array thi kness is shown in Fig. 3b.\nAll the minibands are easily seen to shift towards\nhigher energies with de reasing h2 . This is aused by\nan in rease in energy omponent Ez related to the quantization in the z dire tion. The e\u001e ien y of the solar\nell is in this ase mainly limited by the small shift EI\n\nFigure 3. (a) The absolute ele troni energy bands (the gray\narea) and gaps (white area) versus rod length h2 . (b) The\nultimate e\u001e ien y versus h2 , for parameter values adjusted\nso as to apply the isolated layer approximation. The insets in\n(b) present the stru tures in ross se tion along rod axis.\n\nof the intermediate band with respe t to the ondu tion\nband. Thus, hanges in width of the gap between the IB\nand the CB translate dire tly into hanges in ultimate\ne\u001e ien y of the solar ell. The widest gap orresponds\nto dot array thi kness h2 \u2248 50 \u00c5 and implies maximum\nultimate e\u001e ien y of the solar ell based on the stru ture\nunder onsideration. As eviden ed in Fig. 2a, the maximum gap width entails the overlap of the two minibands\noriginating from the \u001crst and the se ond minibands in\nthe 2D dispersion relation. The gap loses, and the IB\nmerges into the CB, for h2 \u2248 72\u00c5, as a result of redu ed\nspa ing between energy levels Ez and the large number\nof minibands in the system.\nV.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nThe thi kness of the dot array has a substantial e\u001be t\non the ele troni spe trum of the stru ture onsidered in\nthis study. With dot arrays thi k enough, the ele troni\nminibands aused by the in-plane periodi ity are seen to\nlose as a result of a large number of overlapping minibands. This is due to the dense quantization along the\ndire tion perpendi ular to the layer. The e\u001e ien y of a\nsolar ell using a quantum dot array, for stru tures based\non AlGaAs, is mainly limited by the narrow minigaps in\nthe ondu tion band. The ultimate e\u001e ien y de reases\nas the minigaps gradually lose as a result of growing\ndot array thi kness. The dot array thi kness optimal\n\n\f5\nfrom this point of view orresponds to the widest minigap; thus, for a hexagonal latti e of GaAs dots embedded\nin Al0.35 Ga0.65 As with \u001clling fra tion f = 0.3, the optimal dot array thi kness is h2 = 50\u00c5, equal to the latti e\nonstant of the 2D heterostru ture.\n\n\u2217\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n\nklos\bamu.edu.pl\nM.
