Introduction\nHigh-data-rate communication systems at millimeter and optical frequencies, remote sensing and\ndetection and the astronomical imaging all require understanding of stochastic pulse propagation.\nAs pulses consist of a typically broad frequency band the complete information about transient\npropagation requires a solution for the statistical moments of the wave field at different frequencies\nand locations [8].\nLet k1 , k2 be two (relative) wavenumbers nondimensionlized by the central wavenumber k0 . Let\nthe wave fields \u03a8j , j = 1, 2, of kj , j = 1, 2, satisfy the paraxial wave equation in the dimensionless\nform [8]\n(1)\n\ni\n\n\u2202\n\u03b3 2\n\u03bckj\nz x\n\u03a8j (z, x) +\n\u2207 \u03a8j (z, x) +\nV ( , )\u03a8j (z, x) = 0,\n\u2202z\n2kj\n\u03b3\n\u03b4 \u03b5\n\nj = 1, 2\n\nwhere \u03b3 is the Fresnel number, V represents the refractive index fluctuation with the correlation\nlengths \u03b4 and \u03b5 in the longitudinal and transverse direction, respectively, and \u03bc is the magnitude.\nBoth \u03b4 and \u03b5 are small parameters related by the anisotropy parameter \u03b1 as \u03b4\u03b1 = \u03b5. When\n\u03b1 \u226a 1 (resp. \u03b1 \u226b 1), the refractive index fluctuates much faster (resp. slower) in the transverse\ndirection(s) than in the longitudinal direction.\nAn important regime for classical wave propagation takes place when the correlation length is\nmuch smaller than the propagation distance but is comparable or much larger than the central\nwavelength which is proportional to the Fresnel number. This is the radiative transfer regime for\nmonochromatic waves described by the following scaling limit\n\u221a\n(2)\n\u03b3 = \u03b8\u03b5, \u03bc = \u03b4, \u03b8 > 0, such that lim \u03b8 < \u221e,\n\u03b5\u21920\n\nDepartment of Mathematics, University of California, Davis, CA 95616 Email: fannjiang@math.ucdavis.edu.

With two different frequencies,\nthe most interesting scaling limit requires another simultaneous limit\n(3)\n\nlim k1 = lim k2 = k,\n\n\u03b5\u21920\n\n\u03b5\u21920\n\nlim \u03b3 \u22121 (k2 \u2212 k1 ) = \u03b2 > 0.\n\n\u03b5\u21920\n\nWe shall refer to the conditions (2) and (3) as the two-frequency radiative transfer scaling limit.\nThe two-frequency mutual coherence function [8]\n\u03b3y\n\u03b3y\n\u039312 (z, x, y) = E[\u03a81 (z, x +\n)\u03a82 (z, x \u2212\n)],\n2\n2\nwhere E stands for the ensemble averaging, plays an important role in analyzing propagation of\nrandom pulses [8]. But in the radiative transfer regime the two-frequency mutual coherence function\nis not as convenient as the two-frequency Wigner distribution, introduced in [5], which is a natural\nextension of the standard Wigner distribution and is self-averaging in the radiative transfer regime.\n1.1. Two-frequency Wigner distribution. The two-frequency Wigner distribution is defined\nas\nZ\n\u03b3y\nx\n\u03b3y\nx\n1\n(4)\ne\u2212ip*y \u03a81 (z, \u221a + \u221a )\u03a8\u22172 (z, \u221a \u2212 \u221a )dy\nW (z, x, p) =\nd\n(2\u03c0)\nk1 2 k1\nk2 2 k2\nwhere, as well as below, we have adopted the easier notation \u03bej = (kj )\u22121/2 . The choice of the\nscaling factors in the definition is crucial.\nThe Wigner distribution has the following properties:\nZ\nx\n\u03b3y\nx\n\u03b3y\nWz (x, p)eip*y dp = \u03a81 (z, \u221a + \u221a )\u03a8\u22172 (z, \u221a \u2212 \u221a )\n(5)\nk1 2 k1\nk2 2 k2\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u0012\u221a\n\u0013d\nZ\n2\nk1 k2 \u03c0\nk1 p\nk1 q b \u2217\nk2 p\nk2 q\n\u2212ix*q\nb\n(6)\n+\n)\u03a82 (z,\n\u2212\n)\n\u03a81 (z,\nWz (x, p)e\ndx =\n\u03b3\n4\u03b3\n2\n4\u03b3\n2\nRd\nand hence contains all the information in the two-point two-frequency function. Furthermore, the\ntwo-frequency Wigner distribution W satisfies the two-frequency Wigner-Moyal equation exactly\n[5]\n1\n\u2202W\n(7)\n+ p * \u2207x W + \u221a V z W = 0\n\u2202z\n\u03b1\u03b5\nwhere the operator Vz is given as\n\u0015\n\u0014\nZ\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u03b1z\n\u03b8q\n\u03b8q\niq*x/( k2 \u03b5)\n\u22121\niq*x/( k1 \u03b5)\nk1 W (x, p + \u221a ) \u2212 e\nk2 W (x, p \u2212 \u221a ) Vb ( , dq).\nVz W = i \u03b8\ne\n\u03b5\n2 k1\n2 k2\n2. Assumptions on the refractive index fluctuation\n\nWe assume that Vz (x) = V (z, x) is a centered, z-stationary, x-homogeneous random field admitting the spectral representation\nZ\nVz (x) = exp (ip * x)V\u0302z (dp)\nwith the z-stationary spectral measure V\u0302z (*) satisfying\n\nE[V\u0302z (dp)V\u0302z (dq)] = \u03b4(p + q)\u03a60 (p)dpdq.\nThe transverse power spectrum density is related to the full power spectrum density \u03a6(\u03be, p) as\nR\n\u03a60 (p) = \u03a6(w, p)dw. The power spectral density \u03a6(~k) satisfies \u03a6(~k) = \u03a6(\u2212~k), \u2200~k = (w, p) \u2208 Rd+1\nbecause the electric susceptibility field is assumed to be real-valued. Hence \u03a6(w, p) = \u03a6(\u2212w, p) =\n\u03a6(w, \u2212p) = \u03a6(\u2212w, \u2212p) which is related to the detailed balance of the limiting scattering operators\ndescribed below.\n2\n\n\fMore specifically we make the following two assumptions.\nAssumption 1. V (z, x) is a Gaussian process with a spectral density \u03a6(~k), ~k = (w, p) \u2208 Rd+1\nwhich is uniformly bounded and decays at |~k| = \u221e with sufficiently high power of |~k|\u22121 .\nWe note that the assumption of Gaussianity is not essential and is made here to simplify the\npresentation.\nLet Fz and Fz+ be the sigma-algebras generated by {Vs : \u2200s \u2264 z} and {Vs : \u2200s \u2265 z}, respectively\nand let L2 (Fz ) and L2 (Fz+ ) denote the square-integrable functions measurable w.r.t. to them\nrespectively. The maximal correlation coefficient r(t) is given by\n(8)\n\nr(t) =\n\nsup\n\nsup\n\nh\u2208L2 (Fz )\nE[h]=0,E[h2 ]=1\n\ng\u2208L2 (F + )\nz+t\nE[g]=0,E[g 2 ]=1\n\nE [hg] .\n\nAssumption 2.

If we now let \u03b1 \u2192 0, then the kernel becomes\nZ\n\u0001\n\u03b8q\nK(p, q) = \u03b4 (p + \u221a ) * q\n\u03a6(w, q)dw.\n2 k\nWe refer to this as the transverse case because the transverse correlation length \u03b5 is much shorter\nthan the longitudinal correlation length \u03b4.\nOn the other hand, in the longitudinal case \u03b1 \u2192 \u221e the limiting\nkernel would vanish. In order to\n\u221a\nmaintain an interesting limit, we increase \u03bc by a factor of \u03b1. Then the kernel for the longitudinal\ncase becomes\n(11)\n\nK(p, q) = \u03a6(0, q).\n\nIn both the longitudinal and transverse cases the fluctuations in the refractive index are extremely\nanisotropic.\nTheorem 2.

(9) and (12) reduce to the standard radiative transfer equations\nderived in [4], [6]. The proof of these results follows exactly the strategy developed in [4] and\noutlined in [6], originally developed for the standard one-frequency Wigner distribution (see [5] for\nthe same strategy applied to the two-frequency Wigner distribution for a different scaling limit).\nAnother notable fact is that eq. (9) with (11) and eq. (12) with (15) are similar to the governing equations for the ensemble-averaged two-frequency Wigner distribution for the z-white-noise\npotential analyzed in [5]. This can be understood by the similar behaviors of the potential more\nrapidly fluctuating in z to the z-white-noise potential and the (less) rapid fluctuation in x gives\nrise to self-averaging which is lacking in the z-white-noise potential.\n4. The longitudinal and transverse case\nTo illustrate the utility of these equations, we proceed to discuss the two special cases in three\ndimensions. For simplicity, we will assume the isotropy of the medium in the transverse coordinates such that \u03a6(w, p) = \u03a6(w, |p|). As a consequence D = DI with a constant scalar D in the\nlongitudinal case whereas in the transverse case D(p) = C|p|\u22121 p\u0302\u22a5 \u2297 p\u0302\u22a5 with the constant C given\nby\nZ Z\n\u03c0\n\u03a6(w, p\u22a5 )dw|p\u22a5 |2 dp\u22a5 .\nC=\n2\n\nHere p\u0302\u22a5 \u2208 R2 is an unit vector normal to p \u2208 R2 .\nFirst of all, the equation (12) by itself gives qualitative information about three important parameters of the stochastic channel: the spatial spread \u03c3\u2217 , the coherence length lc and the coherence\nbandwidth \u03b2c , through the following scaling argument. One seeks the change of variables\n\u221a\n\u03b2\nx\nz\n(16)\nx\u0303 = \u221a , p\u0303 = plc k, z\u0303 = , \u03b2\u0303 =\nL\n\u03b2c\n\u03c3\u2217 k\n\nwhere L is the propagation distance to remove all the physical parameters from (12) and to aim\nfor the form\n!\n!\n\u2202\n\u03b2\u0303\n\u03b2\u0303\nW + p\u0303 * \u2207x\u0303 W = \u2212 \u2212i\u2207p\u0303 + x\u0303 * \u2212i\u2207p\u0303 + x\u0303 W\n(17)\n\u2202 z\u0303\n2\n2\nin the longitudinal case and the form\n(18)\n\n!\np\u0302\u22a5 \u2297 p\u0302\u22a5\n\u03b2\u0303\n\u2202\nW + p\u0303 * \u2207x\u0303 W = \u2212 \u2212i\u2207p\u0303 + x\u0303 *\n*\n\u2202 z\u0303\n2\n|p\u0303|\n\n!\n\u03b2\u0303\n\u2212i\u2207p\u0303 + x\u0303 W\n2\n\nin the transverse case. From the left side of (12) it immediately follows the first duality relation\nlc \u03c3\u2217 \u223c L/k. The balance of terms inside each pair of parentheses leads to the second duality\nrelation \u03b2c \u223c lc k/\u03c3\u2217 . Finally the removal of D or C determines the spatial spread \u03c3\u2217 which\u221ahas a\ndifferent expression in the longitudinal and transverse case. In the longitudinal case, \u03c3\u2217 \u223c DL3\nwhereas in the transverse case \u03c3\u2217 \u223c C 1/3 L4/3 k\u22121/6 .\n4\n\n\fIn the longitudinal case, the inverse Fourier transform in p\u0303 renders eq.

This solution gives asymptotically precise information about the cross-frequency correlation, important for analyzing the information transfer and time reversal with broadband signals\nin the channel described by the random Schr\u00f6dinger equation [7] (see also [3], [2], [1]). It is unclear\nif the transverse case is exactly solvable or not.\nReferences\n[1] P. Blomgren, G. Papanicolaou and H. Zhao, Super-resolution in time-reversal acoustics. J. Acoust. Soc.
