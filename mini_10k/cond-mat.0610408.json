This local probe\nuses a quartz tuning fork ensuring high tunnel junction stability. We performed the spatially-resolved\nspectroscopic study of a superconducting nano-circuit patterned on an insulating substrate. Significant deviations from the theoretical prediction are observed.\nPACS numbers: 07.79.-v, 74.78.Na, 07.20.Mc\n\nScanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM) is a powerful\ntool for imaging surfaces down to the atomic scale. It also\nallows to measure the electronic Local Density Of States\n(LDOS) with an accuracy of 2kB T given by the thermal smearing. This so-called Scanning Tunneling Spectroscopy (STS) technique has been used in many fields\nof condensed matter physics. Cryogenic environment is a\nkey to reach the best spectroscopic energy resolution and\naccess the fundamental electronic properties of quantum\nmechanics-driven nanostructures. Nevertheless, the application of STS in the field of mesoscopic devices and\nnano-circuits is still in its infancy. The main reason is\nthat a STM needs a fully metallic surface to be operated\nsafely, which is not the case of nano-circuits patterned on\ninsulating substrates.\nOn the other hand, the Atomic Force Microscopy\n(AFM) technique [1] is capable of imaging any kind of\nsurface with an excellent resolution, although no information can be gained on the electronic LDOS. A combination of both modes of microscopy in a versatile instrument, namely a cryogenic AFM-STM with the STS\ncapability, is therefore of particular interest. As the same\ntip is used for both microscopy, a metallic nano-circuit\ncan be located with the force microscopy before being\nprobed in the tunneling mode. The local spectroscopy of\nthe nano-structure is then possible like in an usual STS\nexperiment.\nThe STS is a very demanding technique in terms of\njunction stability. The use of a metallized cantilever as\nthe force sensor is therefore prohibited, since its natural flexibility would prevent a sufficient tunnel junction\nstability. An alternative consists in the use of a quartz\ntuning fork (used in watches), which was proposed in the\nframework of Scanning Near-field Acoustic Microscopy\n[2] and since then applied in many kinds of local probes\n[3, 4, 5, 6]. A tuning fork-based AFM probe brings the\nadvantage of its natural stiffness at low frequency, which\nis a prerequisite for the STS. Moreover, the oscillation\nof a tuning fork can be detected with electrical means,\navoiding any optical setup. Finally, a tuning fork dissipates a very small amount of power. This makes the\ntuning fork-based AFM the choice candidate for AFM-\n\nSTM experiments at very low temperature.\nIn this letter, we report on the characteristics and performances of a combined AFM-STM operating at very\nlow temperature down to 60 mK in a dilution refrigerator. We demonstrate its application to the study of the\nlocal electronic properties of a superconducting submicron wire patterned on a sapphire substrate. Significant\ndeviations from the BCS prediction are observed, which\nare related to the very small thickness of the wire.\nOur AFM-STM is an evolution of a home-made very\nlow temperature STM [7, 8]. The microscope is thermalized on the top plate of an upside-down dilution refrigerator with a base temperature of 60 mK. Every electrical\nconnection entering the microscope's hermetic calorimeter is now filtered with radio-frequency filters made of 20\ncm-long high capacitance micro-coaxial wires [9].\nWe are using commercial quartz tuning forks resonating at 32768 Hz. To mount a probe, we first cut the\ntuning fork packaging just above the fork prongs end.\nKeeping the tuning fork box avoids possible damage\nto the tuning fork itself and provides a good electrical\nshield for the electrical measurements. Then we glue\nan electrochemically-etched tungsten tip with a small\namount of conductive epoxy at the end of the top prong,\nsee Fig. 1 inset. The metallic contact between the tip\nand one tuning fork electrode enables us to use the latter\nas the tunnel current collector while the other electrode\nis used for the AFM signal measurement. We chose to\nmount the tip perpendicular to the tuning fork prongs, so\nthat tip-sample interaction forces are probed, not shear\nforces.\nAfter fabrication, the tuning fork probe is fixed on the\nmicroscope scanner tube. It is excited mechanically by\nadding a small a.c. component to the high voltage applied to the tube's inner electrode. Although the tube\nresponse is attenuated by about two decades in amplitude in the relevant frequency range (30-32 kHz), this\nmethod avoids the use of an additional piezo-electric element and enables us to measure simultanously the tunnel\ncurrent and the AFM signal. Compared to a bare tuning\nfork, the resonance frequency shift and the quality factor\nof a tuning-fork probe depend strongly on the amount of\n\n\f2\n\nFIG. 1: (Color online) Plot of the phase (dotted line) and amplitude (full line) of the AFM-STM probe response close to\nits resonance. The measurement is performed at 4 K with a\nmechanical excitation through the scanner tube.

The cylindrical tuning fork packaging (length 8 mm) was cut just above\nthe fork prongs prior to gluing.\n\nglue and on the geometry of the tip gluing. Figure 1 displays a typical frequency response of an AFM-STM probe\nat cryogenic temperature. The resonance frequency is\nshifted down by about 700Hz while the quality factor of\nabout 50000 remains quite good.\nAs the tip approaches the sample surface, the tuning\nfork oscillation is influenced by the tip-sample interaction forces. In the small amplitude limit, the resonance\nfrequency is shifted proportionally to the force gradient\n[1, 10]. Figure 2a shows a typical dependence of the frequency shift \u2206f as a function of the tip-sample distance.\nThe zero distance reference has been defined with an estimated accuracy of 0.3 nm as the position where a tunnel\nresistance of 1G\u03a9 is reached (at a 0.5 Volt bias). The\noscillation amplitude of 0.8 nm is close to the small amplitude limit, so that the resonance frequency shows a\nclear negative shift regime and exceeds - 1 Hz at a distance of about 3 nm. For the sake of operation reliability,\nwe chose to operate in the positive shift region which features a steep evolution of the frequency shift as a function\nof distance of the order of 2 Hz per nanometer.\nAs for AFM imaging, we use a Phase Locked Loop\nelectronics that maintains the excitation frequency precisely at the resonance, while an adjustable gain amplifier\nalso maintains the oscillation amplitude constant. In this\nFrequency Modulation mode (FM-AFM), the measured\nfrequency shift feeds the distance regulation electronics\nthat operate with a setpoint of 0.15 to 0.5 Hz. As for test\nimages, Fig. 2b shows an image of a reference sample\nmade of a silanized silica surface with adsorbed colloidal\nAu nano-particles of 5 nm diameter. Dots appear with\na height of 5 nm and a full width at half maximum of\nabout 35 nm. This apparent size increase shows that our\n\nFIG. 2: (Color online) (a) Frequency shift \u2206f as a function\nof the tip-sample distance on a Nb-Au film at 150 mK.

In the vertical direction, we achieve routinely atomic\nresolution. As an example, the Fig. 2c image of a sapphire R-plane substrate annealed for 1h in air at 1100\u25e6C\ndisplays regular atomic steps (step height of 0.34 nm).\nThe measured corrugation on a given atomic plane is 0.1\nnm, which demonstrates the excellent vertical resolution\nof the set-up.\nWe have achieved very low temperature AFM-STS experiments on submicron Nb wires patterned on such a\nsapphire substrate. An epitaxial Nb layer of 15 nm was\ndeposited in UHV at 500\u25e6 C and covered by a thin Si (5\nnm) capping layer [11]. We used e-beam lithography and\nReactive Ion Etching (RIE) to pattern a Nb meander\nline. Our process provides a clean Nb surface, although\na few small local defects may remain. Figure 3a shows\na 3D representation from an AFM image of a sample at\nT = 100 mK. A Nb wire with a width of about 300 nm\nand a height of 8 nm is imaged, in agreement with expectations. The observed r.m.s. corrugation on the wire's\nsurface is about 0.8 nm. After taking several images, we\nmoved the probe over the wire and switched the microscope to the STM mode. At this moment, the tuning\nfork is no longer excited and the input of the distance\nregulation is fed with the tunnel current signal.\nWe performed local spectroscopy measurements by acquiring direct I-V characteristics that were subsequently\nnumerically differentiated in order to access the LDOS. A\nseries of spectroscopies was acquired along the arrow displayed on Fig. 3b and with a 5 nm displacement between\nevery spectroscopic measurement. In this case, displacement and spectroscopic measurements were made with a\nconstant tip-sample distance corresponding to a 50 M \u03a9\ntunnel barrier. The tunnel resistance could be decreased\n\n\f3\n\nFIG. 3: (Color online) (a) 140 \u00d7 950 nm2 AFM image of a\n300 nm-wide Nb wire patterned on a sapphire substrate at 100\nmK.

(b) Differential conductance\nspectra acquired at 100 mK in units of the high bias conductance equal to 50 M\u03a9. The spectroscopies from bottom to\ntop were acquired along a 25nm-long displacement of the tip\non the Nb wire. The arrow superposed on the AFM image\ngives the position, length and direction of the spectroscopic\nscan.\n\ndown to 10 M \u03a9 while still keeping a good junction stability. The noise level of the I-V characteristics is due\nto both the vibration of the tip-sample distance and the\nmeasurement noise. The exponential dependence of the\ntunnel current I with the distance z gives the formula:\n\u221a\ndI\n2mW\n=\u2212\ndz,\n(1)\nI\n~\nm being the electron mass and W the metal work function of about 4 eV. Neglecting the effect of the measurement noise, the measured current noise level of below\n0.5% gives then an upper limit for the peak-peak tip vibration of 0.5 pm. This demonstrates the high stability\nof the tuning fork-based AFM-STM probe.\nThe Figure 3b spectra display a clear superconducting\ngap with a width of 2\u2206=2.32 meV which is slightly below\nthe gap of bulk Nb (3.0 meV) but consistent with the\n\nmeasured critical temperature of 7.4 K. The expected\nsuperconducting coherence length is 9.8 nm. The third\nspectrum shows slightly smaller coherence peaks than the\nothers. This behavior is presumably related to a local\ndefect that weakens locally the superconductivity. The\nother spectra are very close to each other and show a\nsmearing that cannot be accounted for by the measured\nsample temperature (100 mK).\nAs an energy resolution test, we performed AFMSTM spectroscopy experiments on thick Nb films. We\nobtained spectra that could be fitted by the BardeenCooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory and an effective temperature close to 200 mK, in agreement with our recent STS\nexperiments [8]. We therefore conclude that our measurements are not affected by thermal smearing or noise and\ngive an accurate measure of the LDOS of the Nb surface.\nThe LDOS thus features smeared peaks and a significant\nsub-gap density, in clear deviation from the BCS theory.\nThis behavior appears to be linked to the small thickness of the film as the same behavior was observed on\nunprocessed films of similar thickness. An inverse proximity effect due to the presence of a metallic and nonsuperconducting Nb oxide layer at the sample surface or\nat the sapphire-Nb interface is a possible explanation for\nthe observed behaviour which calls for further investigation.\nIn conclusion, we have developed a very low temperature local probe combining Force Microscopy and Scanning Tunneling Spectroscopy. The high rigidity of the\ntuning fork used as a force sensor enables us to obtain\nhighly stable measurement conditions as demonstrated\nby a first spectroscopy experiment on a submicron superconducting wire. This combined AFM-STM technique opens wide perspectives in the study of quantum\nnano-circuits. This set-up can be used for Scanning Tunneling Potentiometry of a current-biased device. By using a superconductive tip on a metallic sample, out-ofequilibrium effects can be investigated through measurements of the local energy distribution function [12].\nWe thank the CRTBT technical staff, and especially\nA.
