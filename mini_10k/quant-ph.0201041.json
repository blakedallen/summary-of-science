2002\n\nEmbezzling Entangled Quantum States\nWim van Dam\u2217\n\nPatrick Hayden\u2020\n\nJanuary 10, 2002\n\nAbstract\nWe show that in the presence of arbitrary catalysts, any pure bipartite\nentangled state can be converted into any other to unlimited accuracy\nwithout the use of any communication, quantum or classical.\n\nThe interconvertibility of entangled quantum states is an important question in\nquantum information theory, both for its own sake and because of its connections to quantum error correction [2], quantum cryptography [5] and quantum\ncommunication complexity [1]. In 1999, Nielsen and Hardy supplied a powerful tool for studying this problem, in the form of a simple characterization of\nthe bipartite pure states convertible into each other using only local operations\nand classical communication (LOCC) [7, 9]. Building on that work, complete\ncharacterizations of the corresponding probabilistic [10] and approximate [11]\nconversion problems soon followed. In addition, Jonathan and Plenio discovered the existence of catalysts: states that are recovered once a transformation\nis complete but whose presence allows successful LOCC protocols that would\nnot otherwise have been possible [8].\nIn this Letter, we exhibit a family of bipartite catalysts {|\u03bc(n)i}\u221e\nn=1 such\nthat, for any \u03b5 > 0 and any bipartite state |\u03c6AB i, the transformation\n|\u03bc(n)i\n\n7\u2192 |\u03bc(n)i \u2297 |\u03c6AB i\n\n(1)\n\ncan be accomplished with fidelity better than 1 \u2212 \u03b5 for all sufficiently large n\nwithout any communication, quantum or classical. In other words, it is possible\nto embezzle a copy of |\u03c6AB i from |\u03bc(n)i, thereby removing a small amount of\nentanglement from the original state, while causing only an arbitrarily small\ndisturbance \u03b5 to it. This embezzlement protocol only requires the two parties A\nand B to rearrange the coefficients of the \u03bc(n) state such that it resembles the\ndesired \u03bc(n) \u2297 \u03c6AB . (An analogy to this phenomenon is illustrated in Figure 1.)\nBecause the set of states {\u03bc(n)} can be used to embezzle any target state \u03c6 to\n\u2217 Computer\n\nScience Division, Soda Hall, University of California, Berkeley, CA 94720\n(USA).

Email:\npatrick@cs.caltech.edu.\n\n1\n\n\fwithin an arbitrarily high fidelity 1\u2212\u03b5 that depends only on the Schmidt rank of\n\u03c6 and the size n, we call the set a universal embezzling family. It follows trivially\nthat this family can also be used as a catalyst to 'convert' a now superfluous\n\u03c8AB to \u03c6AB with arbitrarily small error.\nThe index n indicates the Schmidt rank of the specific |\u03bc(n)i, and for each\nn the embezzling state is defined by\nn\n\nX 1\n1\np\n\u221a |jiA |jiB ,\nC(n) j=1 j\n\n|\u03bc(n)i :=\n\n(2)\n\nPn\nwhere C(n) := j=1 1j is chosen so that |\u03bc(n)i is normalized. Now suppose\nPm\nwe would like to embezzle the state |\u03c6AB i :=\ni=1 \u03b1i |iiA |iiB from |\u03bc(n)i,\nwhere |\u03c6AB i is written according to its Schmidt decomposition such that all \u03b1i\namplitudes\nare positive reals. This problem is equivalent to creating the state\nPmn\n|\u03c9(n)i = j=1 \u03c9j |jiA |jiB , which is defined as the state with the same Schmidt\nbasis and coefficients as |\u03bc(n)i\u2297 |\u03c6AB i but with the coefficients \u03c9j in decreasing\norder. Thus |\u03c9(n)i can be converted into |\u03bc(n)i\u2297|\u03c6AB i exactly by local unitary\noperations alone. The embezzlement protocol will simply consist of performing\nthese local unitaries because we will show that |h\u03bc(n)|\u03c9(n)i| goes to 1 as n goes\nto infinity.\nThe first step in the proof will be to show that the first n Schmidt coefficients\nof |\u03c9(n)i are smaller than the corresponding ones of |\u03bc(n)i. To see this,pobserve\nthat the first n Schmidt coefficients of |\u03c9(n)i are all of the form \u03b1i / jC(n),\nwhere 1 \u2264 i \u2264 m andp1 \u2264 j \u2264 n. For a fixed t and i, we let Nit be\np the number of\nsuch coefficients \u03b1i / jC(n) that are strictly greater thanP1/ tC(n). By the\nm\nrestriction 1 \u2264P\nj < \u03b12i t, it follows that Nit < \u03b12i t and, since i=1 \u03b12i = 1, we can\nm\nconclude that i=1 Nit < t. This\np upper bound on the number of \u03c9j coefficients\nthat are strictly bigger than 1/ ptC(n) combined with the ordering \u03c91 \u2265 \u03c92 \u2265\n. . . \u2265 \u03c9mn proves that \u03c9j \u2264 1/ jC(n) for all 1 \u2264 j \u2264 n. Consequently, the\nfidelity between |\u03bc(n)i and |\u03c9(n)i can be bounded from below by\n|h\u03bc(n)|\u03c9(n)i|\n\n=\n\nn\nX\nj=1\n\n\u03c9\np j\njC(n)\n\n\u2265\n\nn\nX\n\n\u03c9j2 .\n\n(3)\n\nj=1\n\nOur next task is to show that this sum\nPmis close to 1 for large n. Let |\u03c8(n)i :=\n|\u03bc(n)i \u2297 |\u03a6m i, where |\u03a6m i := \u221a1m i=1 |iiA |iiB is the maximally entangled\nP\nP\nstate of rank m. Then \u03c9(d)A \u227b \u03c8(d)A and it follows that nj=1 \u03c9j2 \u2265 nj=1 \u03b2j2 ,\nwhere (\u03b2j ) is the vector of Schmidt coefficients of |\u03c8(n)i in decreasing order.\nThis last sum is easy to evaluate, however:\nn\nX\nj=1\n\n\u03b2j2\n\n\u2265\n\n\u230an/m\u230b m\nX X\nj=1\n\ni=1\n\n1\njC(n)m\n\n\u2265 1\u2212\n\nlog(m)\n.\nlog(n)\n\n(4)\n\nThus, for any fidelity 1 \u2212 \u03b5 < 1, the requirement n > m(1/\u03b5) on |\u03bc(n)i suffices.\nIf we view the state |\u03c6AB i as a string of log m pairs of qubits then |\u03bc(n)i need\n2\n\n\fonly consist of ( 1\u03b5 ) log m pairs of qubits, which is only linear in the number of\nqubits of |\u03c6AB i.\nThe embezzlement protocol we present here requires absolutely no communication and uses the same set of catalysts for every input. Is it possible that by\ntailoring the catalyst to the target state as well as making use of local operations\nand classical communication that we could find more effective embezzlement\nschemes? Not significantly. Let n be the Schmidt rank of the catalyst |\u03bei and\nconsider the transformation |\u03bei 7\u2192 |\u03bei \u2297 |\u03c6AB i. Suppose the optimal LOCC\nprotocol yields the state \u03c3AB . In Ref. [11] it was shown that this optimal \u03c3AB\nwill be a pure state with Schmidt basis matching that of |\u03bei \u2297 |\u03c6AB i. Since\nthe entanglement cannot be increased by an LOCC protocol, S(\u03c3A ) \u2264 S(\u03beA ).\nTherefore, if Tr|\u03c3A \u2212 \u03beA \u2297 \u03c6A | = \u03b4, the Fannes' inequality [6] implies that, for\n\u03b4 < 1/e,\nS(\u03c6A ) \u2264\n\n|S(\u03beA \u2297 \u03c6A ) \u2212 S(\u03c3A )| < \u03b4(log(m) + log(n)) + \u03b7(\u03b4),\n\n(5)\n\nwhere \u03b7(\u03b4) = \u2212\u03b4 log \u03b4 and m is the rank of \u03c6A , and hence\nS(\u03c6A ) \u2212 \u03b7(\u03b4)\nlog(m) + log(n)\n\n<\n\n\u03b4.\n\n(6)\n\nFor our protocol, however, a straightforward calculation reveals that\n\u03b4 = Tr|\u03c9(n)A \u2212 \u03bc(n)A | =\n\nn\nX\nj=1\n\n(\u03bc2j \u2212 \u03c9j2 ) +\n\nnm\nX\nj=n+1\n\n\u03c9j2 \u2264\n\n2 log(m)\n, (7)\nlog(n)\n\nwhere we used the fact that \u03bcj \u2265 \u03c9j for 1 \u2264 j \u2264 n and \u03bcj = 0 for j > n\ncombined with the bound of Eq. (4). Clearly, for a fixed \u03c6AB this \u03b4 saturates\nEq. (6) to within a constant factor for large n.\nWe have shown that it possible to embezzle entanglement without any communication whatsoever and that the set {|\u03bc(n)i} can be used to embezzle any\nbipartite pure state. Furthermore, we have shown that the universal family\n{|\u03bc(n)i} is nearly optimal, almost saturating the limit on embezzlement imposed by the continuity of the von Neumann entropy.\nThe embezzlement phenomenon has a number of consequences for the study\nof quantum information. For example, it implies that the trumping relation on\nbipartite entangled states [4] is not stable to arbitrarily small perturbations. In\nother words, in the presence of unrestricted catalysts, all states are effectively\nreachable from all others without communication. Similarly, a standard proof\ntechnique in quantum communication complexity reduces distributed function\nevaluations to related state transformations [3]. The amount of communication\nfor the distributed problem is related to the amount of communication required\nto perform the corresponding state transformation. Our results imply that\nthis technique will fail on attempts to study the probabilistic communication\ncomplexity of functions when an unlimited amount of initial entanglement is\nallowed.\n\n3\n\n\fAcknowledgments: We would like to thank Sumit Dixit for helpful conversations.

By a well-chosen rearrangement we can create the suggestion that the six pieces of the rightmost\nfigure, with area size 59, can also be used the cover the triangle on the left\nwith its surface of 60 units. A similar phenomenon is described in this Letter\nfor the entanglement of a distributed quantum state. It is shown how we can\nreorder the amplitudes of an embezzling state \u03bc such that we get a very close\napproximation of an enlarged state \u03bc \u2297 \u03c6, which appears to have significantly\nmore entanglement than the original \u03bc.\n\n5\n\n\f"}
