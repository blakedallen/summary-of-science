Introduction:\nThe conventional quantum field theory calculation of gravity/supergravity\nloops in four dimensions is maligned with ultraviolet divergences and hence it\nis non-renormalizable [1].This is easily realized by naive power counting and\nthe presence of higher derivative terms in the Lagrangian. On the contrary it\nis claimed that N = 4 super-Yang Mills theory is a finite theory [3]. By Kawai,\nLewellen and Tye (KLT)rule the gravity tree amplitudes can be expressed as\nthe Yang-Mills tree amplitudes [4]. By the method of unitarity cutting rules it\nis shown that N = 8 supergravity has the same ultraviolet behaviour as that of\nN = 4 super-Yang Mills theory and hence it is claimed to be finite [2]. This fact\nrenews ample motivation to study off-shell behaviour of N = 8 supergravity\nin the form of closed string field theory. The usual N = 8 supergravity action\nis obtained from compactifying type II string theory on a six torous or d = 11\nand N =1 supergravity M-theory action. On the contrary we study here the\nself-dual supergravity as a N =2 closed string field theory in the Attiyah-Ward\n(AW) space-time. The reason being it is simple and in the linearized level it is\nsame as full non-selfdual theory. The action has the same field content where\nfields with negative helicities are treated as Lagrangian multiplier to the gauge\ncovariant kinetic terms of the positive helicity states. In the pioneering work of\nWitten on twistor string theory [5], all the maximally helicity violating (MHV)\namplitudes of N = 4 super-yang Mills theory are reproduced as D-instanton\ncorrections to the topological B-type string where a Calabi-Yau supermanifold\nCP 3|4 space emerges naturally as the target space of the super-twistor string.\nThe Lagrangian for this B-model is the Open String Field theory Lagrangian of\nsuper-holomorphic Chern-Simons theory, which happened to be anti-self-dual\nSuper Yang-Mills theory. Here the D-instanton correlation function plays the\nvital role in producing the full non- self- dual super Yang-Mills amplitudes.\nHowever Berkovits [6] gives an alternative formulation for the same MHV\namplitudes as the conventional open string amplitudes of the super twistor\nstring. There is a natural generalization of this twistor string proposal of\nN = 4 Super-Yang-Mills theory to that of N = 4 conformal supergravity\n[7]. The conformal supergravity is very nice in the classical level however the\nquantization is not very physically interesting due to the presence of higher\nderivative terms even in the linearized approximation. Due to this Hilbert\nspace is not positive definite and consequently S-matrix violates Unitarity.\nSo a covariant string formulation of N = 8 Einstein Supergravity is more\ndesirable. There are attempts to formulate a super twistor string theory for N\n= 8 supergravity [12]. On the contrary we start from a N = 2 critical closed\nstring theory and write a covariant string field theory lagrangian for self-dual\nN = 8 supergravity. Recently a Lorentz covariant Open string field theory\n3\n\n\fLagrangian for N = 4 self-dual Super-Yang-Mills theory has been proposed\nby Lechtenfeld and Popov [8]. In the same spirit we are trying to formulate\na closed string field theory for the N =8 supergravity. However the problems\nand intricacies are infinitely bigger for this case than the Super-Yang Mills.\nFirst of all to show the local gauge invariance of the super-space one needs to\ngenerate a target super-space from the world sheet variables. Generating super\nspcae from the Neveue-Schwarz variables is extremely complicated may be\npossible. Thus we followed Siegel's [11] approach of putting non-holomorphic\nscalar grassman variables to formulate the super-space.\nThe organization of the paper is as follows. We give adequate review of the\nN =2 critical string theory and basic tools needed for the further construction.\nFirst part of section 3. has basic review of Berkovit's formulation of Closed\nstring and also open string for the Self-dual Yang Mills. In the later part of\nsection 3. we derive our results.\n2. The Preliminaries:\nThe self-dual Yang-Mills and self-dual Gravity theories in 2 + 2 dimensions\nare described by N = 2 critical open and closed strings respectively [9]. The\nperturbative spectrum of N = 2 string has only p2 = 0 as the only ground\nstate. For the four dimensional Euclidean space as the target space there will\nbe each pi zero so that there will be no dynamics and hence this theory is not\nat all interesting. For the non-trivial dynamics of the physical ground state,\nthe target space need to have an SO(2, 2) symmetry so that momenta can\nbe complex. Also only non-vanishing S-matrix amplitude is the three point\nfunction and all higher n-point functions are zero due to the kinematics of\n(2, 2) space. So this massless scalar of the ground state of Open/closed string\ndescribes the dynamics of self-dual Yang-Mills/ Gravity which is topological in\nnature. Before proceeding further it is worthwhile to address the space-time\nsupersymmetry of the N = 2 fermionic string. The three point function is\nonly invariant under the subgroup U(1, 1) of the total Lorentz group SO(2, 2)\nof the target space. This makes the the space-time supersymmetry of N =\n2 critical string theory obscure. However the ground states of the fermionic\nstring with N = 4 world-sheet supersymmetry has larger symmetry and is\ncovariant under SU( 1, 1) \u00d7 SU( 1, 1). Since the highest weight states of\nN = 4 Superconformal algebra are the same as the physical states of N = 2\nalgebra, it has been argued that both the theories are one and the same [10].\nThe four world-sheet fermions with the combinations of both periodic and\nantiperiodic boundary conditions have sixteen bosonic and sixteen fermionic\nstates as the ground states for the closed string and the spectrum is clearly\n4\n\n\fsupersymmetric. To realize explicit Lorentz covariant one needs these extra\nmissing symmetry SO( 2, 2)/SU( 1, 1) which happened to be SL( 2, R) as\ntwistor variables. The Brink and Schwarz [17] action for N = 2 string is:\nZ\n\nS =\n\nd2 \u03c3\n\n\u2194\n\u221a n 1 ab\ng 2 g \u2202a xi \u2202b x\u0304\u012b + 2i \u03c8\u0304 \u012b \u03b3 a D a \u03c8 i + Aa \u03c8\u0304 \u012b \u03b3 a \u03c8 i\n\no\n\n\u2212 a b i\n+ (\u2202a x\u0304\u012b + \u03c8\u0304 \u012b \u03c7+\na )\u03c7b \u03b3 \u03b3 \u03c8 + h.c. \u03b7\u012bi ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere g ab and Aa with a=0, 1, are the (real) worldsheet metric and U(1) gauge\nconnection, respectively and Da is the gravitational covariant derivative for\nthe spinor with spin connection in two dimension and \u03b3a are the worldsheet\ngamma matrices. Here xi and \u03c8 i are complex valued in the target space with\n\u03b7\u012bi metric which has a complex structure. In the N = 2 superconformal gauge\none has both left and right hand sectors of superconformal constraint algebras\ndenoted as T , G+ , G\u2212 and J and T\u0302 , \u011c+ , G\u02c6\u2212 and J\u02c6 respectively. In both the\nsectors one has usual (b,c) ghosts,a pair of (\u03b2\u00b1 , \u03b3\u00b1 )ghosts and a pair of (u,v)\nghosts for U(1) gauge fixing. The cancelation of anomaly dictates the central\ncharge of the matter sector to be 6. It is more convenient for our purpose\nto use SL(2, R) \u00d7 SL(2, R) basis instead of complex coordinate basis for the\ntarget space.

Both the fermions are now integer moded and\nalso fermion of zero weight has zero modes on the sphere. Due to the twisting\nthe curvature singularities of the world sheet are taken care of by these twisted\nfermions rather than the ghosts. In a sense the U(1) anomaly plays the role of\n..\nthe ghost anomaly and \u03c8's play the role of the (b, c) ghosts. Consequently G\u03b1 0\n..\nhas spin one with conformal weight one and G\u03b1 1 has spin two with conformal\n..\nweight two. Hence G\u03b1 0 play the role of BRST- type of currents. Similarly\n....\n....\nJ 0 0 and J 1 1 have conformal weight zero and two respectively. This theory\nhas now N = 4 worldsheet super symmetry and also has SL(2, R) \u00d7 SL(2, R)\u2032\nspace-time symmetry. In order to formulate N = 8 supergravity we keep one\nof the SL(2, R) symmetries rigid and another to extend it to OSP(8 | 2)\nand consequently gauge it.This needs eight fermionic variables to form the\nsuperspace. Infact the ground state closed string spectrum has eight such\nstates. However it is quite obscure to use these as super cordinates. Following\nSiegel [11] we introduce eight fermionic coordinates \u03b8\u03b1i as super partner of\n.\nx\u03b1\u03b1 , which are worldsheet scalars with non-holomorphic corelation function.\nInorder to maintain the conformal invariance a set of bosonic variables (bi , ci )\nare introduced. The operator product expansions of \u03b8's and for (bi , ci ) are\n\u03b8\u03b1i (z, z\u0304) \u03b8\u03b2j (w, w\u0304) \u223c \u01eb\u03b1\u03b2 \u03b4 ij ln |z \u2212 w|2\n\n, bi (z) cj (w) \u223c\n\nThe associated stress tensor is\n.\n. ..\n1\nT = \u2202z x\u03b1\u03b2 \u2202z x . + \u03c8 \u03b1 \u03b2 \u2202z \u03c8 . .. + \u2202z \u03b8\u03b1i \u2202z \u03b8\u03b1i + bi \u2202z ci\n\u03b1\u03b2\n\u03b1\u03b2\n2\nand also similarly its super partners\n..\n. ..\nG\u03b1 1 = \u03c8 \u03b1 1 \u2202z x\u03b1\u03b1. + ci \u2202z \u03b8\u03b1i ,\n\n\u03b4 ij\n.\nz\u2212w\n,\n\n..\n. ..\nG\u03b1 0 = \u03c8 \u03b1 0 \u2202z x\u03b1\u03b1. + ci \u2202z \u03b8\u03b1i\n\n....\n. .. ..\nJ 0 1 = \u03c8 \u03b1 0 \u03c8\u03b1. 1 + ci bi .\n6\n\n(8)\n\n(9)\n\n,\n\n(10)\n(11)\n\n\f....\nindicating a U(1) anomaly\nHowever the OPE of these J 0 1 's are singular as 2+N\n2\n.. z\nwith charge \u2212(2 + N ) which are 2 due to \u03c8\u03b1. 1 and N due to (bi ci ) systems\nrespecively. In the sequel we will show the proper insertions of these \u03c8's and\nci 's for taking the vacuum expectation values of the vertex operators.( For\nthe closed string all the right moving anti-holomorphic fields are described as\nhatted variales.)\n3. Covariant Closed String Field theory:\nThe most conventional approach to covariant String field theory is Witten's\nOpen String Field theory (OSFT) [14], where strings join together at their\nmid point. The gauge invariance of the OSFT demands only a cubic term in\nits interaction. This procedure of joining and splitting of interacting strings\nmaintains the length of the string intact. If one extends this approach to\nclosed string and trys to maintain the length of the intercting string fixed then\nthe required prescription would be to overlap one of the closed strings with\nthe other half of another closed string by that the resulting closed string will\nhave the same length as that of the overlapping strings. The gauge invariance\nof this type of gluing procedure demands the action to be non-polynomial in\nstring field [20]. There is another school of thought for covariant string field\ntheory pursued by Hata et al. [15], who generalized the light-cone string field\ntheory to covariant one by BRST procedure. In this approach the open strings\njoin at their end points and closed string join together at one point only. The\ngauge invariance of the string fields requires that closed string should have\ncubic interaction where as open string should have non-polynomial interaction\nterm. However by this the string length cannot be held fixed hence behave as\na free parameter in the theory. Although this parameter is easily gauged away\nin the on-shell limit, the ambiguity remains for the off-shell theory. Despite\nthis ambiguity we follow this formulation for the simplicity due to the cubic\ninteraction.\n3.1 Preliminaries of closed string field theory action:\nThe basic string field \u03a6 is a functional of the worldsheet string coordinates\n. . .. . ..\n{x\u03b1\u03b2 , \u03c8 \u03b1 \u03b2 \u03c8\u0302 \u03b1 \u03b2 , \u03b8\u03b1i , bi , b\u0302i , ci , \u0109i }. The basic ingredints needed for the gluing and\nsplitting of the closed strings are prescription dependent and these are presented in te appendix. For illustration we present here the Berkovits N = 2\nclosed string theory [16]. For the gluing of string fields, a curvature is created\nat the joining points which is related to the U(1) anomaly as explained in the\nappendix.. The back-ground charge due to the U(1) current which is equiva7\n\n\flent to ghost current of (b, c) system is \u2212 D2 which happens to be -2 in this case.\n. ..\nOne needs insertion of zero modes of \u03c8 \u03b1 0 to compensate this charge in each\nvertex operator. Taking this in to account Berkovits [16] has prposed a closed\nstring field theory action for N = 2 string field theory which kinetic term is\ngiven as:\nZ\n....\n....\n..\n..\n..\n..\nS = < \u03a6(J00 0 + J\u02c600 0 )(G00 0 + \u011c00 0 )(G10 0 + \u011c10 0 )\u03a6 >\n(12)\nHere subscript zero denotes the zero modes of the operators.

To illustrate\n..\nfurther \u2013 the gauge covariant derivative \u2207\u03b1 = G\u03b10 + A\u03b1 and under the\ngauge transformation\n\u2207\u2032\u03b1 = \u03a9\u2207\u03b1 \u03a9\u22121 ,\n\n\u2032\ng\u03b1\u03b2\n= \u03a9g\u03b1\u03b2 \u03a9\u22121 + \u2207\u03b3 K\u03b3\u03b1\u03b2\n\n8\n\n(16)\n\n\fwhere \u03a9 and K\u03b3\u03b1\u03b2 are gauge parameters of the internal symmetry of the YangMills gauge group such that the Lorentz invariant string field theory action\nremains gauge invariant.\nS=\n\nZ\n\n< trg\u03b1\u03b2 f \u03b1\u03b2 > .\n\n(17)\n\nHere is for integral over zero modes of x space and <, > is the expectation value of string field operator products where massive unphysical modes\ncontribute in the off-shell, and\nR\n\n..\n..\nf\u03b1\u03b2 = {\u2207\u03b1 , \u2207\u03b2 } = G\u03b10 A\u03b2 + G\u03b20 A\u03b1 + {A\u03b1 , A\u03b2 }.\n\n(18)\n\nThe {, } denotes the symmetric product of the string fields and each product\nis the Witten's OSFT star product.

More recently Lechtenfeld and Popov [8]\nhave given a covariant cubic string field theory action for the self-dual N = 4\nSupersymmetric Yang-Mills theory in the supertwistor space.\n3.3 Supertwistor space:\nAs mentioned in the section 2. the perturbative string spectrum has only\nmanifest SU( 1, 1) instead of space-time SO( 2, 2) Lorentz symmetry. This\nmissing SO( 2, 2)/SU( 1, 1) symmetry is treated as twistor transformation,\nwhich will be introduced to rotate all the complex structure of the SO(2, 2) and\nfinally integration over this parameter space will ensure the Lorentz covariance.\nThis geometric space H2 = SO( 2, 2)/SU( 1, 1) is a two sheeted hyperboloid.\nFor the Euclidean space R4 the quotient space SO(4)/U(2) parametrizes all the\ncomplex structure happened to be the Rieman sphere CP 1. Atiyah,Hitchin and\nSinger [13] describe the twistor space of R4 as a cmplex manifold PE = R4 \u00d7\nCP 1 ,which is a rank 2 vector bundle over CP 1. similarly the twistor space of\nR2,2 is a complex manifold PH which is R2,2 \u00d7 H2 . This space is covered by\ntwo (acyclic i.e. in one of the patches \u03bb0 is zero and in another patch \u03bb1 is zero\n\n9\n\n\f. \u03b1\n\u03b1\n) coordinate patches U\u00b1 with complex coordinates (\u03c9\u00b1\n, \u03bb\u00b1 ) on each patches\nwhere\n!\n!\n!\n1\n\u2212\u03bb\u00b1\n1\n\u00b1\n\u03b1\n\u03b1\n(\u03bb\u03b1 ) =\n, (\u03bb\u00b1 ) =\n, (\u03bb\u0303\u00b1 ) =\n(21)\n\u03bb\u00b1\n1\n\u2212\u03bb\u0304\u00b1\nwith the normalization\n\n\u03bd+ = (1\u2212, \u03bb+ \u03bb\u0304+ )\u22121 ,\n\n\u03bd\u2212 = \u2212(1 \u2212 \u03bb\u2212 \u03bb\u0304\u2212 )\u22121\n\n(22)\n\n.\n.\n\u03b1\nand \u03c9\u00b1\n= x\u03b1\u03b1 \u03bb\u03b1 \u00b1 . On the overlap U\u2212 \u2229 U+ it is \u03bb+ \u2212 = \u03bb\u2212 . Using the above\n.\n.\n\u03b1\nnormalization the inverse tranformation of x\u03b1\u03b1 in terms of \u03c9\u00b1\nis easly found.\nThis shows the reparamtrization of the twistor space. The ransformations of\nanti-holomorphic vector fields and coordinate vector fields are\n\u2202\n\n\u03b1\n. = \u03bd\u00b1 \u01eb\u03b1. \u03b2. \u03bb\u00b1\n\n\u03b2\n\u2202 w\u0304\u00b1\n\n.\n\u2202\n\u2202\n\u2202\n=\n\u2212 x1\u03b1 \u03bb\u03b1\n. .\n3\u0307\n\u2202 \u03bb\u0304\u00b1\n\u2202 w\u0304\u00b1\n\u2202x\u03b1\u03b1\n\n\u2202\n\n. ,\n\u2202x\u03b1\u03b1\n\n(23)\n\nThus the anti-holomorphic vector fields are\nv\u0304\u03b1\u00b1\n. = \u03bb\u03b1\u00b1\n\n\u2202\n\n. ,\n\u2202x\u03b1\u03b1\n\nv\u03043\u0307\u00b1 =\n\n\u2202\n\u2202 \u03bb\u0304\u00b1\n\n(24)\n\nSimilarly one can construct holomorphic vector fields. Let us extend this ap.\nproach to superspace geometry. For the graded space {x\u03b1\u03b1 , \u03b8\u03b1i }, one has a\ngraded twistor space [18, 8] as PS H which is R(2,2)|N \u00d7 H2 . The local coordi.\nA\nA\nnates on patches US \u00b1 are (\u03c9\u00b1\n, \u03bb\u03b1\u00b1 ) where \u03c9\u00b1\n= [x\u03b1\u03b1 \u03bb\u03b1 \u00b1 \u03bb\u03b1\u00b1 \u03b8\u03b1i ] The anti\nholomorphic vector fields are\nv\u0304\u03b1\u00b1\n. = \u03bb\u03b1\u00b1\n\n\u2202\n\nv\u0304i\u00b1 = \u03bb\u03b1\u00b1\n\n. ,\n\n\u2202x\u03b1\u03b1\n\n\u2202\n\u2202\u03b8\u03b1i\n\n(25)\n\n3.4 BRST formulation in Supertwistor space:\nHere we treat the twistorial parameter \u03bb\u03b1 as a constant complex parameter\nunlike the usual twistor string theory where the super-twistor space is the\ntarget space and also constrained to be a superconformal theory. In this sense\n\u03bb\u03b1 can be treated as a zero mode. (However we can always treat \u03bb\u03b1 and its\ncanonical conjugate as a conformal theory with additional ghosts for conformal\n..\ninvariance.) As mentioned in section 2.

If we assume that the string field also depends on the twistor variable \u03bb, then inorder that the gauge invariance in the entire twistor space\nis maintained we have to add to the Q another antiholomorphic differential\nQ\u03bb\u0304 = d\u03bb\u0304 \u2202\u2202\u03bb\u0304 . One can easily show that Q2 = 0, Q2\u03bb\u0304 = 0 and also the anticommutator of {Q, Q\u03bb\u0304 } = 0 due to the Berezinian nature of \u03c8, \u03b8 and \u03bb\u0304.

Let us define \u03b8\u03b1i = c10 \u03b8\u03b1i\njust to make \u03b8\u03b1i as fermionic coordinates of charge one.( Here any one of the\nzero modes of ci will do. We can work on either of the coordinate patches say\non U\u2212 and drop the - sign from \u03bb\u03b1\u2212 ).

One also get the Prepotential equation\nof Karanas and Ketov [21] once one identifies H\u03b1ald = \u2202\u03b1\u03b1. \u03a6 where \u03a6 is the\nprepotential.\n4. The Conclusion:\n14\n\n\fWe have given here a closed string field theory formulation of N = 8 self-dual\nsupergravity. This is completely off-shell and Lorentz covariant. The field\ntheory limit gives the correct action which was earlier formulated by Karanas\nand Ketov[21] and recently by Mason and Wolf [18] in the super twistor space.\nUnlike the conventional twistor string formulation of recent times [5, ?] and\n[7, 19] where twistor space is the target space we treat here the twistor variable\nas a complex parameter of mixing the world sheet super conformal generators.\nWe will calculate the N point MHV amplitudes using the Witten and Nair's\n[5, 19] principle which enables us to calculate the higher point function in the\ntwistor space although without the twistor space more than 3 point function\nvanishes.\n\nAppendix\nIn this appendix we present very basic properties of Closed string field\ntheories.For any generic string functionals \u03a6i (i = 1, 2, 3), the dot and the star\nproducts have the following properties:\n\u03a61 * \u03a62 = (\u2212)|1||2| \u03a62 * \u03a61 ,\n\n(49)\n\n\u03a61 \u22c6 \u03a62 = \u2212(\u2212)|1||2| \u03a62 \u22c6 \u03a61 ,\n\n(50)\n\n\u03a61 * (\u03a62 \u22c6 \u03a63 ) = (\u2212)|1|(|2|+|3|) \u03a62 * (\u03a63 \u22c6 \u03a61 ) ,\n\u03a61 * QBRS \u03a62 = \u2212(\u2212)|1| (QBRS \u03a61 ) * \u03a62 ,\n\n(51)\n(52)\n\nwhere |i| (i = 1, 2, 3) is 0 (1) if \u03a6i is Grassmann- even or odd.\nA1. The Reflector:\nLet | \u03a6i > is expanded as a basis in a Hilbert space and let < \u03a6i | be its dual\nthen h\u03a6i | \u03a6j i = \u03b4ij . Thus the dot product is defined as\n\u03a8 * \u03a6 = hR(1, 2) | \u03a82 >| \u03a61 i\n\n(53)\n\nThe reflector maps the state | O > to its BPZ conjugate state. More explicitly\nif two string states are described by two punctured speheres with a uniformizing\ncordinate say z. The local coordinate z1 = z = 0 and another with local\ncordinate z2 = z1 = 0 So\nhR(1, 2) | \u03a8i (1) >| \u03a6j (2)i = h\u03a8i (z2 = 0)\u03a6j (z1 = 0)i = Gij\n\n(54)\n\nThis will be non-vaishing of only when the total ghost number of the matrix\nelement vanishes. The closed string vacuum has ghost number - 6. Since any\n15\n\n\fphysical bosonic closed string has ghost number 2, inorder that the dot product\nwill be non-vanishing one defines that\nD\n\n\u03a8 * \u03a6 = R(1, 2)b\u2212\n0\n\n2\n\n| \u03a82 >| \u03a61\n\nE\n\n(55)\n\nwhere b\u2212\n0 = b0 \u2212 b\u03020 .\nA2. The \u22c6 Product:\nThe \u22c6 product is defined as mapping from two string fields to one string field\nsuch as\n| \u03a6 >| \u03a8 >=| \u03a6 \u22c6 \u03a8 >\n(56)\nFor the three point vertex in the language of conformal field theory [22], which\nis written as three conformal mapping of {hr | r = 1, 2, 3} from a unit disk to\nsphere with cordinates z as\nhV123 || \u03c61 >| \u03c62 >| phi3 i = hh1 (\u03c61 )(z1 )h2 (\u03c62 )(z2 )h3 (\u03c63 )(z3 )iS2\n\n(57)\n\nEach map hr is a conformal transformation of the vertex operator at the origin\non the disk to one on the sphere.\n\n16\n\n\fReferences\n[1] G. t Hooft and M.
