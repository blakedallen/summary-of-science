These contradict each other, not only in superdense\nregimes, but also in the vacuum, where the divergent zero-point energy\nwould roll up space to a point. The solution is to build in a regular, but\ntopologically nontrivial distribution of vacuum spinor fields right from the\nstart. This opens up a straight road to quantum gravity, which we map\nout here.\nThe gateway is covariance under the complexified Clifford algebra of\nour space-time manifold M, and its spinor representations, which Sachs\ndubbed the Einstein group, E. The 16 generators of E transformations\nobey both the Lie algebra of Spin c -4, and the Clifford (SUSY) algebra of\nM. We derive Einstein's field equations from the simplest E-invariant Lagrangian density, Lg . Lg contains effective electroweak and gravitostrong\nfield actions, as well as Dirac actions for the matter spinors. On microscales the massive Dirac propagator resolves into a sum over null zigzags. On macroscales, we see the energy-momentum current, \u2217T , and the\nresulting Einstein curvature, G.\nFor massive particles, \u2217T flows in the \"cosmic time\" direction-centrifugally in an expanding universe. Neighboring centrifugal currents of \u2217T\npresent opposite radiotemporal vorticities Gor to the boundaries of each\nothers' worldtubes, so they advect, i.e. attract, as we show here by integrating Lg by parts in the spinfluid regime. This boundary integral not\nonly explains why stress-energy is the source for gravitational curvature,\n\u2217 This paper gives the derivations of the results I reported at the PIMS conference entitled\n\"Brane World and Supersymmetry\" in July, 2002 at Vancouver, B.C. It also contains new\nresults on spin-gravity coupling, on how a topologically-nontrivial distribution of vacuum\nspinors removes singularities and divergences, and how the amplitude of the vacuum spinors\ndetermines the gravitational constant and the rate of cosmic expansion.\n\n1\n\n\fbut also gives a value for the gravitational constant, \u03ba (T ), that couples\nthem. \u03ba turns out to depend on the dilation factor T = y 0 , which enters kinematically as \"imaginary time\": the logradius of our expanding\nFriedmann 3-brane.\nOn the microscopic scale, quantum gravity appears as the statistical\nmechanics of the null zig-zag rays of spinor fields in imaginary time T .\nOur unified field/particle action Lg also contains new couplings of gravitomagnetic fields to strong fields and weak potentials. These predict new\nphysical phenomena: Axial jets of nuclear decay products emitted with\nleft helicity along the axis of a massive, spinning body.\n\n1\n\nOverview: Vacuum Energy and Inertial Mass\n\nQuantum Field Theory (QFT) is incompatible with General Relativity (GR), not\nonly at small scales or high densities, but in the vacuum! The problem is that\nthe divergent QFT vacuum energy would produce enough spacetime curvature\nto roll up our space to a point. The solution is a fundamental theory from which\nboth QFT and GR derive, in different regimes. We show here how quantum\ngravity emerges naturally from such a theory: the Nonlinear Multispinor (NM)\nmodel [1], [2].\nIn this model, the particles emerge [3], [4] through dynamical symmetry\nbreaking of a topologically nontrivial \"vacuum\" solution. Their interactions are\nmediated by the phase perturbations they leave in the residual vacuum around\nthem.\nWe may summarize the role of the vacuum spinors in producing inertial and\ngravitational mass [2] like this:\nNonlinear interaction of opposite-chirality components through the\nvacuum spinor fields creates the inertial mass of a bispinor particle.\nIt also produces the gravitational interaction between particles.\nInertial mass from global interaction-and its corollary, gravitation, are results we derive from the NM model. We thus supply a mechanism that embodies\nMach's principle (inertia from interaction with the \"distant masses\"), and Einstein's principle (inertial mass equals gravitational mass). Let us start with the\n\"big picture\", and then zoom in to the microscopic level.\nThe new \"precision cosmology\" [5] has suddenly given us a clear view of the\nuniverse in which we live. We live on a 3-brane (hypersurface) S3 (a) whose\n(local) radius a (x) is expanding with intrinsic clocktime: Minkowsky time, t \u2261\nx0 ; the arclength travelled by a photon, projected to S3 (a# ) [6]. We take S3 to\nbe a closed hypersurface-a deformed, nonuniformly expanding 3-sphere.\nIf we could rise above our expanding spatial hypersurface S3 and look down\non it from the direction T = y 0 of cosmic expansion, we would see a patchwork\nquilt of matter concentrations connected by the fabric we call \"space\". It is\nbecoming clear that space is not empty. It is filled with \"dark energy\", which\nincludes the quantum mechanical vacuum energy and comprises over 70% of the\n\n2\n\n\fenergy in the universe [7]. On the macroscopic scale, this is what produces the\ncosmological constant term that brings the average energy (almost exactly) to\nthe critical value needed to just close the universe.\nOf what is this vacuum energy made? Before we get a microscopic view of\nthe vacuum, let us first zoom in on some of the matter concentrations that it\nseparates-starting with a single electron. The worldtube, B4 , of an electron (or\nany massive particle at rest) runs in the cosmic time direction, T , orthogonal\nto the 3 spatial directions that span our spatial 3-brane, S3 (T ).\nThe chiral components \u03be \u2212 and \u03b7 \u2212 of e\u2212 are spinors: lightlike waves of\ninternal u (1) \u2295 su (2) phase with definite helicity (spin in the direction of propagation). Since \u03be \u2212 and \u03b7 \u2212 have opposite helicities but the same spins, they\nmust be counterpropagating-radially outward and inward for an electron at\nrest. Since the rest frame of a massive particle drifts slowly outward with cosmic expansion, there must be almost as many inward (\"backward\" in T ) as\noutward (\"forward\") lightlike ray segments within its worldtube [8].\nAt the worldtube boundary \u2202B4 , zigs are scattered into zags and vice versa\nby nonlinear interactions with the vacuum spinors [2]. It is these mass scatterings [9] that keep the lightlike spinors of a massive bispinor particle confined to\na timelike worldtube. Energy-momentum, angular momentum, and all internal\nquantum numbers are conserved at each mass scattering, where 4 Lie-algebra\nphases of incoming and outgoing spinors combine to give a scalar contribution\nto the action.\nMass scatterings, or Spin c -4 resonances, are the multispinor analog of the\nBragg resonances (4-wave mixing) [10] which produce the self-trapping that\nleads to soliton formation in nonlinear optics. The same nonlinearity gives the\nsoliton interactions. These are most easily calculated for conservative fields by\nintegrating the Lagrangian density by parts over the boundary of the worldtube\nof an accelerated particle. Matching the inner form of the boundary integral in\nthe localized soliton fields to the outer form in the vacuum fields, as perturbed\nby source distributions, gives the curvature of the particle's worldtube [11].\nWe derive Einstein's field equations here by integrating a topological Lagrangian by parts. The crucial step is to recognize that Einstein curvature G\nand energy-momentum \u2217T are different expressions for the same flux, the spinfluid current 3 form. Inside the worldtube, B4 , of a particle, this takes the form\nof the stress-energy-momentum tensor [12], \u2217T . This is Noether current under\ndisplacement of the boundary \u2202B 4 of the worldtube. In the outer region, the\nspinfluid current takes the form of the Einstein curvature [13], G. By matching\nthe inner and outer forms on the moving boundary \u2202B4 (t), we obtain Einstein's\nfield equations.\nWe obtain the quantum mechanical form of this boundary integral by focusing on a patch of boundary at a microscopic scale, where the matter current\nis resolved into a sum over null zig-zags [9]; mass-scatterings with the vacuum\nfields, as perturbed by source distributions. Analyticity conditions convert the\nstatistical mechanics of mass scatterings in imaginary time or logradius T \u2261 y 0\nto a quantum theory of the mutual attraction of matter currents: quantum\ngravity.\n3\n\n\f2\n\nSpinfluid Flow: The Dilation-Boost Current\n\nConserved currents spring from invariances under the group of spin isometries of\nour spacetime manifold M: the Einstein (E) group [14]. Passive Einstein (EP )\ntransformations relate the same physical state \u03c8 in different frames of reference.\nActive Einstein (EA ) transformations change \u03c8 in a way that can be undone\nby local, path dependent EP transformations. Spin curvatures, or fields, are the\nobstruction to \"combing\" \u03c8 to covariant constancy by any (path-independent)\nEP transformation.\nCosmic expansion and boost-covariance demand that E be nonunitary-i.e.\nhave Hermitian (H) as well as anti-Hermitian (aH) generators. The energymomentum current, \u2217T , is the Noether current of the spinor fields under spacetime translations [12]. In an expanding universe [6], the net dilation flow is\ncentrifugally outward, in the direction T of cosmic expansion. Cosmic time\nT \u2261 y 0 enters kinematically [6], [9] as the imaginary part of a complex time\nvariable z 0 \u2261 x0 + iy 0 , where x0 \u2261 t is Minkowsky time. y 0 transforms like\nan energy. The imaginary parts y j of z j \u2261 xj + iy j transform like 3-momenta.\nThe dilation current is the energy density, the boost current is the momentum\ndensity. The 4 complex variables z \u03b1 are coordinates on the position-momentum\nphase space [2], [6]:\nM \u2282 T \u2217 M \u2282 C4 ;\nthe base space for the bundle of vacuum \u2295 matter spinors.

Each spinor\nI\n\u03c8\u00b1\nI and cospinor \u03c8 \u2213 is expressed as a linear combination of the two (\"spin-up\"\nand \"spin-down\") basis spinors in its moving spin frame, with coefficients given\nI\nby the column or row spin vectors \u03c8 \u00b1\nI (x) or \u03c8 \u00b1 (x):\n\u0001 \u00b1\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\ni \u03b1\u00b1\n\u03c8\u00b1\nI (x) = exp 2 \u03b6\u0010I (x) \u03c3 \u03b1 \u03c8 I \u0011\u2261 gI (x) \u03c8 I ,\nI\n(1)\n\u03c8 I\u00b1 (x) = \u03c8 I\u00b1 exp 2i \u03b6 I\u03b1\u00b1 (x) \u03c3 \u03b1 \u2261 \u03c8 I\u00b1 g\u00b1\n(x) ;\n\u03b1 = (0, 1, 2, 3) ,\n\nwhere \u03c3 \u03b1 \u223c (\u03c3 0 , \u2212\u03c31 , \u2212\u03c3 2 , \u2212\u03c3 3 ) is the Lie algebra dual to \u03c3 \u03b1 under the Clifford\nproduct\n\u03c3 \u03b1 \u03c3 \u03b2 + \u03c3 \u03b2 \u03c3 \u03b1 = 2\u03b7 \u03b1\u03b2\nfor Minkowsky space. The \u00b1 signs indicate the charge (u (1) phase shift) of\nthe field. (We shall sometimes drop the charge scripts below.) Spinors and\ncospinors must be varied independently in the Lagrangian, which must contain\nboth to be a scalar under EP .\nIn the geometrical-optics (g.o.) regime, each spinor has a complex, nonsingular (but perhaps path-dependent) phase (1) with (perhaps inexact) gl (2, C)\nphase differential d\u03b6 \u03b1\nI (x).

Here, the\nphases of J = 1, 2, 3, or 4 pairs of spinors either become singular, or break away\nfrom P T C-symmetry [3].\nWe call the union \u222aD\u03b1 of all these strata and their incidence relations,\ntogether with the periods of all 1, 2, 3, and 4 forms quantized over embedded\nhomology cycles, the Spin c -4 complex, S.\nEach singular locus DJ \u2282 S carries its own topological charges: integrals of\nJ forms or their dual (4 \u2212 J) forms over J cycles or their transverse (4 \u2212 J)\ncycles [3]. Each charge is quantized in integer units. The spin connections (7)\nderived from the canonical maps (6) of spin space over spacetime correspond to\ncovering number C2 = 1.\nThe topological action ST is a conformal invariant that comes in topologicallyquantized units [3]. Any (local) rescaling of a solution preserves ST ,and so is\nstill a solution. Thus, topological Lagrangian LT cannot be the Lagrangian for\nmassive fields inside their worldtubes, because mass arises from the breaking of\nscale invariance.\nElsewhere [1], [2] we exhibited a \"grandparent\" Lagrangian density for both\nthe outer (regular) region [3], where it reduces to LT , and the inner (singular)\nregion, inside the worldtubes of massive particles:\nLg \u2261 id\u03c8 R\u00b1 \u03c8 L\u2213 \u2227 \u03c8 L\u00b1 d\u03c8 R\u2213 \u2227 d\u03c8 L\u00b1 \u03c8 R\u2213 \u2227 \u03c8 R\u00b1 d\u03c8 L\u2213\n\n(27)\n\n(average over all neutral sign combinations in which each spinor, or its differential, appears exactly once).

Outside the worldtubes DJ\nof massive particles, the action Sg is stationarized by the outer solution. This\nturns out [2], [6] to be both C and P T -symmetric: it preserves the \"inner\"\nproducts \u03c8 R\u00b1 \u03c8 L\u2213 of P T C-conjugate spinors as conformal invariants [2].

The mechanism that breaks\nscale invariance and endows bispinor particles with inertial mass emerges in\na remarkable way [2], [6] when ansatz (28) for the perturbed spinor fields is\ninserted into Lagrangian (27). We summarize below (please see Appendix also).\nMassless fields, like the vacuum spinors in (28), contribute terms with\nconfor\u0001\nmal weight \u03b3 \u22124 to the Lagrangian. These integrate to terms of O \u03b3 0 -constant\nterms-like homogeneous the vacuum action of \u221216\u03c03 W \u0001(26).\nAs the scale factor \u03b3 increases past 1, terms of O \u03b3 \u22123 in Lg localize about\n3 cycles, corresponding to the condensation of bispinor particles (leptons) from\n\"seed\" perturbations\nwrapped about 3 cycles in the perturbed vacuum. It is\n\u0001\nthese O \u03b3 \u22123 terms that give the effective massive Dirac action [2].

Inside B4 ,\nthe light spinors (\u03be \u2212 , \u03b7 \u2212 ) zig zag forward (outward) in cosmic time T , while\nthe heavy spinors (\u03c7+ , \u03b6 + ) zig zag backward (inward), producing a net drift\nthat is only statistically forward in T . At each vertex where a light and heavy\nspinor meet, the photons \u03b3 \u2261 \u03be \u2212 \u2297 \u03b6 + or \u03b3 \b \u2261 \u03b7 \u2212 \u2297 \u03c7+ appear to be created\nor annihilated. It is the statistics of this process-the stochastic interactions of\nfour matter spinors with four vacuum spinors-that yields the massive DiracMaxwell propagator of Q.E.D. exactly [8].\nMeanwhile, it is easy to see why no massive particle can move faster than\nlight-which is \"all zig, and no zag\": because its internal zigs and zags, though\nall lightlike, propagate in opposite directions!\nThe vacuum fields create Dirac mass-the resistance of a bispinor particle\nto acceleration. Qualitatively, when a particle, P , is accelerated by \u25b3v over\none mass scattering time \u25b3t, the vacuum spinors impart a greater momentum\nchange \u25b3p \u2261 p\u2212 \u2212 p+ to the \"trailing surface\" \u2202B4\u2212 of its worldtube boundary than to its \"leading surface\" \u2202B4+ . The frequency of mass scatterings is\n(proportional to) the rest mass of P ; (\u25b3t)\u22121 \u223c m. Thus \u25b3p \u223c m \u25b3 v; the\ndiscrete version of Newtons law for inertial forces. This is Mach's principle in\naction. Quantitatively, all of the relativistic kinematics of massive particles may\nbe derived from mass scatterings with the vacuum spinor fields on the worldtube\nboundary [24].\nReciprocally, massive particles perturb the vacuum fields. On the macroscopic level, gravitation is the spacetime curvature on the boundary of the world\ntube of a test particle caused by perturbations due to sources. We derive Einstein's field equations in the next section by matching the spin curvatures due to\nthe source to the stress-energy on the moving boundary \u2202B4 of a test particle's\nworldtube.\n\n6\n\nMatching Boundary Vorticity to Energy Momentum Flux\n\nThe form of the effective matter Lagrangian 4 form, LM , inside the worldtube\nB4 , and its stress-energy 3 form \u2217T , depends on the particle. But the form\nof the field Lagrangian outside the worldtubes is universal. This gives us just\nenough information to match the integral of the outer, field 3 form G, and the\ninner, energy-momentum flux \u2217T of the matter fields on the moving boundary\n\u2202B4 (\u03c4 ), and thus derive Einstein's field equations. We outline the steps below.\nFor convenience, we work in our fiducial reference frame e\u03b1 \u2208 T \u2217 M# ; then\ntranslate our results to a dilated frame E \u03b1 = \u03b3e\u03b1 \u2208 T \u2217 M.\n1.

Standard coupling\nconstants like \u03ba\u2032 (49) are thus determined by the vacuum-field amplitudes, and\nhence their values depend on the radius of the Friedmann solution.\nWe show below how the field term in action (36) contains not only the standard Palatini action for the gravitational field, but predicts a new interaction\nbetween gravitomagnetic fields and weak potentials.

The net effect of the qKW interaction term is to\ncause weak-decay products to be ejected with left-helicity with respect to the axis\nof rotation, producing axial jets.\nAstronomical observations often show plasma jets ejected along the axes of\nrotating quasars, pulsars, and active galactic nucleii [22]. I don't know if their\nhelicity has been measured. Left-helical polarization of such jets would tend to\nsupport the NM model.\nNow it could be argued that, if observed, the left-helical polarization could\nbe explained by standard electroweak theory. But left-helicity enters there as an\nassumption. The NM model derives the left-helicity preference of weak decays\nfrom dynamical symmetry breaking of the vacuum spin connection \u03a90 in the\n*0\n\nforward timelike direction: y > 0 in (57).

Here, the mass\nscatterings that define the fuzzy boundary \u2202B4 of the particle's world tube are\ndisplaced by nonunitary perturbations of the vacuum spinors sourced in other\nparticles. This is quantum gravity.\nQuantum field theory is statistical mechanics in imaginary time [23], T \u2261 y 0 .\nT is cosmic time, which enters kinematically as the imaginary part of a complex\ntime parameter z 0 \u2261 x0 + iy 0 , whose real part dx0 \u2261 |dx| is arclength increment\nalong a null ray (e.g. the path of a photon).

To make a massive particle with definite spin,\nL- and R-chirality moieties must be counterpropagating, i.e. have opposite momenta, but the same spins, and therefore opposite helicities. The propagator\nfor a massive bispinor particle [8], [9] is thus a sum over null zig-zags: counterpropagating lightlike segments with mass scatterings at each corner.\nThese mass scatterings are vertices in a Riemann sum for the action, Sg ,\nwhich we compute as follows:\ni) Re-express Sg with respect to complex Clifford (internal) and spacetime\n(external) null tetrads on CM# \u2282 T \u2217 M# ,\n\u03c3 \u00b1 \u2261 \u221a12 (\u03c3 1 \u00b1 i\u03c3 2 ) ;\n\u0001\ne\u00b1 \u2261 \u221a12 e1 \u00b1 ie2 ;\n\n\u03c3 \u2191\u2193 \u2261 \u221a12 (\u03c3 0 \u00b1 \u03c3 3 ) ,\n\u0001\ne\u2191\u2193 \u2261 \u221a12 e0 \u00b1 e3 .\n\n(58)\n\nii) Discretize the 8-spinor form (27) for our Lagrangian density Lg , and compute our Riemann sums for Sg over null lattice, N , stepped off by null\ntetrads (58).

The charges \u25b3\u03b80 (p), spins \u25b3\u03b8j (p), and 3\nmomenta \u25b3\u03c6j add to zero at every Spin c -4 scattering, p.\niii) To automatically insure quantization of action [3], we should take the area\nof the elementary 2 cells \u03b3\nb2 in a rectangular null lattice to be \u25b3p \u25b3 q = h2 .\nThis not only assures that \u25b3\u03b6 (\u03b3 2 ) = 2\u03c0in about any phase space cycle\n\u03b3 2 , but also allows all of the spinor wave functions \u03c8 (p) to be single-valued\nat each p \u2208 N .

Then all of the topological charges-J forms DJ \u2208 H J M\nb\nover cycles in M-will\nhave discrete realizations as products of J net phase\ndifferences quantized over discrete cycles in N . We call this complex of\nspinor phase shiftsPquantized over cycles in the null lattice N a singular\nSpin c -4 complex, .\nP\nThe action\nof each\nis the sum of contributions from every Spin c -4\nP\nP scattering in . Particle propagators are sums over all null zig-zag paths in\nthat\nconnect the initial and final state [16].\nNow the bending of the worldtube B4 (P ) of a massive particle P is described\nby a changing 4 momentum \u25b3\u03c6\u03b1 (P ) = \u2212\u25b3\u03c6\u03b1 (V ) imparted by mass scatterings\non \u2202B4 (P ) with the vacuum spinors, V . Anholonomic changes \u25b3\u25b3\u03c6\u03b1 (V ) \u223c G\nin the vacuum spinors due to sources are what impart curvature \u25b3 \u25b3 \u03c6\u03b1 (P )\nat the worldtube boundary \u2202B4 (P )), via the discrete version of the boundary\nintegral in (36).\nMass scatterings at the worldtube boundary account not only for the curvature of the worldtube B4 (P ), but also for the annihilation of P and creation\n23\n\n\fof intermediate particles by recombination of its spinor components with each\nother and with the vacuum spinors.\nEach particle is composed of J chiral pairs of L- and R-chirality spinors:\nleptons of 1, mesons of 2, and hadrons of 3 pairs, respectively [4]. Their reactions are \"crossover\" exchanges of spinors from the ingoing to outgoing sets of\nparticles-and with the (4 \u2212 J) remaining pairs of vacuum spinors that make\nthe spacetime tetrads (17), metric tensor (16), and the effective vector potentials (9) and fields in (36). Particle propagators, like the Dirac propagator [8],\nthus include creation of intermediate particles and their return to the vacuum\n\"sea\". In this sense, the NM model is innately quantum mechanical, and does\nnot need to be \"quantized\".\nBut wait! There are two basically different recipes, representing different\nunderlying physical processes, for computing the \"sum over null zig zags\" in the\nDirac propagator [8]!\nR1) The \"sum over histories\". Create an ensemble \u03a3C of singular Spinc4 complexes h\u03a3C i with the same set of topological charges and particle\ntrajectories, C, as our classical Spin c -4 complexes and with isomorphic\nsingular homologies. Each \u03a3C represents a different microscopic history\nof mass scatterings and intermediate annhialation/creation events compatible with the classical history, C. Now average over the ensemble of all\nsuch \u03a3C to get quantum mechanical expectation values of observables-\njust as we average over all microstates to get expectations values in statistical mechanics. These expectation values, h\u03c8i (p), evolve according to\nthe Dirac propagator.\nR2) The stochastic process. Create a random walk of the (lightlike) rays\nof matter spinors, \u03c8, and their mass-scatterings vertices, p, with the remaining vacuum spinors, treated as random fields, with mean distributions\n(18), and variances |\u25b3\u03c6| |\u25b3\u03b8| = h2 . The resulting probability vector \u03c8 (p)\nfor the matter fields evolves by the Dirac propagator.\nIn R1), there are \"many worlds\" that exist\nP simultaneously. In R2), there\nis only one world-the real Spin c -4 complex -but we cannot know enough\ninformation about the vacuum spinors and their fluctuations to distinguish it\nfrom the other members \u03a3C of its ensemble. Both remain valid interpretations of\nNM model, as they are for standard quantum mechanics, and even for statistical\nmechanics!\nP\nSuffice it to say here that a realistic model, with one real Spin c -4 complex\nis not precluded, because\nis nonlocal. Half of the spinors incident\nP the NM model\non every vertex p \u2208\nin the Spin c -4 complex-the conjugate-analytic spinors\n\u03c8 (z)-propagate backwards in cosmic time, T , i.e. in the opposite direction\nto cosmic expansion. These carry only slightly less energy than the forwardpropagating, analytic spinors \u03c8P\n(z). Macroscopically [18], the net result is that\nour Friedmann 3-simplex \u03a33 \u2282\nexpands much more slowly than the speed of\nlight. Microscopically, the result R of a measurement may propagate backwards\nin T to become one of the phase increments \u25b3\u03b6 R incident on p. R would thus\n24\n\n\fP\n\"bootstrap\" cycles in\nconnecting p and R-self-consistent causal cycles that\nare temporally nonlocal. \"Paradoxical\" cycles (like killing your own grandfather)\nwould simply not boot-strap, and therefore not exist in the real Spin c -4 complex.\nContrapositively, all the existing vertices p and 1, 2, 3, and 4 cycles \u03b3 J must be\nembedded self-consistentlly in the real Spin c -4 complex-our whole world, how\nit was made, and what we make of it.\nP\nAny attempt to isolate a local simplex of , and give a deterministic recipe\nfor its T evolution, necessarily ignores links with other local simplices on its\nboundary, and with the global, but stochastic vacuum spinor fields. The best\nwe can do is to average over the ensemble \u03a3C of simplices with every possible\nconfiguration of boundary fields and vacuum spinors-and so our theory can\nonly predict ensemble averages.\n\n9\n\nConclusion\n\nThe vacuum spinors are what produce the inertial mass of a bispinor particle\nbecause mass scatterings with the vacuum fields are what confine chiral pairs of\nmatter spinors to a timelike worldtube, B4 . Inside B4 , the matter spinors \"zag\"\nbackwards in cosmic time T almost as often as they \"zig\" forward. Macroscopically, the timelike flux of the spinfluid decreases away from the boundary\n\u2202B4 of a source. This creates a \"curl\" K0r in the vacuum flow that causes the\nworldtubes of test particles to curve, i.e to accelerate towards the source.\nSpinfluid models thus give a mechanism for gravitation. Qualitatively,\ni) vorticity arises on the boundary of each energy-momentum current, \u2217T .\nii) rotation R of the spin fluid flow falls with distance from the source current.\nIts moment \u2217G at the boundary of the worldtube of a test current causes\nthis worldtube to bend towards the source. Thus,\niii) neighboring centrifugal currents (masses) present opposite radiotemporal\nvorticities Gor to each other's worldtube boundaries-and therefore attract\n(or advect, like hydrodynamic vortices [11]).\nQuantitatively, the gravitational constant is determined by the same balance\nbetween outward flow and boundary curvature that determines the equilibrium\nradius of the Friedmann universe. The power of spinfluid models to determine\nsome constants of nature also makes them falsifiable. For example, relations\n(29) and (47) give the value\n\u03bam2e =\n\n\u03b3 \u22122\n(T )\n8\n\n(60)\n\nfor the dimensionless constant that measures the ratio of gravitational to electromagnetic forces between electrons on our dilated Friedmann 3-brane, S3 (a).\nThe predicted value of (60) would match the value of 10\u221239 observed today with\n\n25\n\n\fa dilation factor of \u03b3 \u223c 1020 and predicts that this ratio should decrease with\ncosmic expansion!\nAt T = 0, on S3 (a# ), gravitational and electromagnetic forces have the\nsame order of magnitude, because they have not yet separated. It is cosmic\nexpansion-the breaking of T \u2013reflection symmetry-that divides the forces into\nelectroweak (P T -antisymmetric) and gravitostrong (P T -symmetric) sectors [2].\nMicroscopically, the action Sg is a sum over mass scatterings between J\nchiral pairs of matter spinors and (4 \u2212 J) vacuum pairs plus the action of the\nperturbed vacuum spinor fields. Together, these make up a Spin c -4 complex.\nThe statistical mechanics in \"imaginary time\" T \u2261 y 0 of all null Spin c -4 complexes \u03a3C compatible with a given set C of classical particle trajectories, masses,\nand charges is quantum gravity.\nI don't know how our NM model compares with other theories of quantum gravity. There is a crucial experimental test, however. The NM model\npredicts a new effect in supervortical regimes: that Lens-Thirring fields should\npolarize weak decays, producing left-helicity jets about the rotation axis [2],\n[16]. Perhaps such axial jets could be measured in terrestrial laboratories or in\nastronomical observations.\nMore significant than the prediction of new effects of the derivation of fundamental constants and selection rules or are the qualitative features of the class\nof quantum spinfluid models that enable them to reconcile quantum mechanics\nand general relativity. These are\n1. A Lagrangian density with no free parameters that is a natural 4 form-i.e.\ninvariant under the group of passive spin isometries in curved spacetime,\nincluding symplectomorphisms.\n2. An action that includes a bounded vacuum energy which depends on the\nradius a (t) of the Friedmann solution. This breaks dilation invariance\nand sets all length and mass scales. It includes a repulsive term at high\ndensities that prevents collapse to a singularity.\n3. Values for the standard coupling constants that are either \"frozen in\" by\nthe history of dynamical symmetry breaking, or that depend on cosmic\ntime T through the radius a (T ).\n4. Effective electroweak, strong, and gravitational field actions, along with\nminimal coupling through spin connections in the covariant derivatives.\n5. Fields which are sourced in localized currents with topologically quantized\ncharges. These charges parallel the electric charges, masses, spins, and\nlepton or baryon numbers of the observed families of particles.\n6. A mechanism for gravitation derived from the same nonlinear coupling to\nthe vacuum spinors that creates the inertial masses of particles.\n7. Quantum propagators, including intermediate creation and annihilation\noperators, which are derived from the statistical mechanics of null zig26\n\n\fzags of the (lightlike) spinor fields that weave the (timelike) worldtubes of\nmassive particles and the (spacelike) fabric that connects them.\nThe NM model is the minimal model with these features, because:\na) It takes the intersection of 4 null cones to determine a point on M.\nb) Each nullcone is generated, via S \u22121 of (15), by the product (9) of 1\ncospinor and 1 spinor differential. There must be 8 spinor fields in all; 4\nP T C-equivalent pairs.\nc) For symplectic invariance, each term in Lg must contain 4 spinors \u03a8I and 4\ndifferentials d\u03a8I . The symplectic forms are the 4 Maurer-Cartan 1 forms\n\u03a8I d\u03a8I = \u03a9I . Their integrals are quantized over 1-cycles.\nd) Under P T C symmetry, Lg reduces to the Maurer-Cartan (MC) 4 form.\nIts action Sg measures the covering number of the compactified internal\ngroup U (1) \u00d7 SU (2) over the compactified spacetime manifold M# . Sg is\na topological invariant; it comes in integral units.\ne) Since the vacuum energy has a topological upper bound of 16\u03c03 W [3], with\nW an integer that does not change with refinement of the lattice, there\nare no built-in divergences, and we don't have to worry about unbounded\nvacuum energies rolling up our space to a point. There is no need for\nrenormalization.\nf) The NM model admits nonperturbative solutions [3], [6] in the superdense\nregimes inside collapsed objects like neutron stars, black holes, and the\nearly universe. These solutions are regularized by the resistance (26)\nof the topologically nontrivial vacuum to compression to a point [3]-a\n\"pressure\" of the vacuum spinors that contributes no additional energymomentum (see Appendix).\nThe vacuum energy-or dark energy-is\no the energy of the homogen simply\nI\nneous distribution of vacuum spinor fields \u03c8\u0302 I , \u03c8\u0302 , on which the gauge fields\nride like waves on the surface of an ocean. Material particles are the caustics of these vacuum spin waves [3], [4]-topological dislocations with quantized\ncharges.\nWe have found some classical soliton solutions [24] for the unified field action\nLg with topologically quantized charges [3]. These exemplify the inner solutions\nof Section 4. A stratification lemma [4] classifies the varieties of inner solutions\nthat can exist, and their allowed reactions. These seem to parallel the observed\nparticles and reactions, with no exceptions 4 noted so far.\n4 When I presented the NM model at CERN in July of 2000, T.T. Wu asked, \"Can you\naccount for neutral pion decay?\" Wu's question was the gateway for me into spinor exchanges\nwith the vacuum sea. It then became clear how even the simplest reactions and interactions,\nlike photon emission and absorption, recruit spinors from the vacuum and then return them\n[4].\n\n27\n\n\fThe above results all support our picture of the Spin c -4 complex of global\nvacuum spinors, matter spinors, and their mass scatterings as the microscopic\nreality. Spacetime, gauge fields, and the observed varieties of matter fields and\ntheir reactions, including gravitation, emerge from dynamical stratification [4]\nof the Spinc-4 complex as 1, 2, 3, and 4 chiral pairs of spinor fields break away\nfrom the P T C-symmetric vacuum distribution.\n\n10\n\nAcknowledgments and Dedication\n\nThanks go to Jaime Keller [20], who first understood and explained to me the\nadvantages of the chiral gl (2, C) presentation over the twistor presentation of\nthe conformal group for massive bispinor particles.

Like kinks and knots in a hose\nas it is pulled tight, topological defects in the spinfluid localize with cosmic\nexpansion, and they acquire mass.\nLike the residues of complex scalar fields, our action integral has a nested\nset of complex quaternionic (Clifford) residues [3]: integrals over codimensionJ singular loci DJ \u2282 C4 \u2282 T \u2217 M in phase space, where the P T C-symmetric\ngeometrical optics ansatz (1) breaks down.

Altogether, we get terms with conformal weights p = [\u22124, \u22123, \u22121, 0]\nb with its\nin our effective Lagrangian Lbg (\u03c8, d\u03c8) for our Friedmann vacuum M\nembedded topological twists: spacetime, with a \"foam\" of singular loci-the\nmassive particles.

This balance lives in the domain\nof electroweak-gravitostrong unification with a regular, topologically-nontrivial\ndistribution of vacuum spinors; it cannot be captured by ad-hoc cutting and\npasting of quantum field theory and general relativity.\n\nReferences\n[1] M.S.
