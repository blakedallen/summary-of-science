The derivation of effective spin models describing the low\nenergy magnetic properties of undoped CuO2\u2013planes is reinvestigated. Our\nstudy aims at a quantitative determination of the parameters of effective\nspin models from those of a multi\u2013band model and is supposed to be relevant to the analysis of recent improved experimental data on the spin wave\nspectrum of La2 CuO4 . Starting from a conventional three\u2013band model we\ndetermine the exchange couplings for the nearest and next\u2013nearest neighbor Heisenberg exchange as well as for 4\u2013 and 6\u2013spin exchange terms via a\ndirect perturbation expansion up to 12th (14th for the 4\u2013spin term) order\nwith respect to the copper\u2013oxygen hopping tpd .

The relevance of the 4\u2013spin coupling as the leading\ncorrection to the nearest neighbor Heisenberg model is emphasized.\nKeywords: CuO2\u2013planes; three\u2013band model; Heisenberg model; four spin\ninteractions; quantum antiferromagnets.\n\n\f1\n\nIntroduction\n\nAfter the discovery of the high\u2013Tc superconducting oxides [1] it soon became\nclear that a minimum model for describing their electronic properties had to\ncontain at least three bands [2] derived from the copper crystal field state\n3dx2 \u2212y2 and from oxygen 2px and 2py orbitals [3]. In a seminal paper Zhang\nand Rice showed [4] that the low energy physics of the three-band model is\nin fact contained in an effective single\u2013band model, the type of model which\nwas envisaged initially by Anderson [5].\nThe work presented here is concerned with a reinvestigation of the derivation of effective single\u2013band models from three-band models for CuO2\u2013planes.\nThe present paper will be confined to the study of undoped CuO2\u2013planes\nwhere the effective models contain spin degrees of freedom only. Effective\nlow energy models are derived from high energy parent models via perturbative expansions [6]. The focus of this work is placed on how to obtain\nhigh precision coupling constants for the effective spin models and what are\nthe leading corrections to the familiar nearest neighbor Heisenberg model.\nFor the system of strongly correlated electrons considered here the copperoxygen hopping tpd is the expansion parameter of choice. The expansion in\npowers of tpd is, however, not straightforward due to its rather small radius\nof convergence. Therefore, expansions beyond the leading order are required\nfor obtaining reliable results. This is probably the reason why in existing\nderivations of the magnetic Hamiltonian of CuO2\u2013planes the couplings are\nusually off by a factor of up to 2 [7, 8]. The dominant term in the effective\nHamiltonian is the Heisenberg nearest neighbor exchange obtained in fourth\norder which is substantially corrected by higher order contributions which\nwe will present up to twelfth order. In eighth order ring exchange processes\nstart to contribute four\u2013spin terms to the effective Hamiltonian which turn\nout to be not at all small [9]. Our results are consistent with the recent\ninterpretation [10] of improved experimental data on the spin wave spectrum\nof La2 CuO4 in terms of sizable four\u2013spin exchange terms [11]. In comparison\nto these four\u2013spin terms second and third neighbor Heisenberg terms which\nalso first appear in eighth order turn out to be rather tiny. We have calculated all these terms up to twelfth order (four\u2013spin term up to fourteenth\norder). It is evident from the results of these series expansions that physically\nrelevant values of tpd are larger than the radius of convergence. We find, however, that Pad\u00e9 approximants of these series expansions provide consistent\nextrapolations to the range of physically relevant model parameters.\n1\n\n\fThere is an alternative approach to the perturbative treatment of three\nband models which shows a much better behavior of convergence and which\nwe have also applied to obtain an independent check of the significance of\nthe Pad\u00e9 approximants derived from the direct expansion. This approach has\nbeen introduced in the paper of Zhang and Rice on the three band model in\nwhich this model was reformulated in terms of hybridizing oxygen Wannier\norbitals centered at the copper ion sites [4]. In this notation the hopping\nHamiltonian contains a large site\u2013diagonal hybridization t0 which is easily\ntreated exactly for each copper ion site and small intersite hybridizations\nwhich are then treated safely in a perturbative fashion. Along these lines\nZhang and Rice achieved not only a clever rearrangement of the tpd perturbation series, but also a particularly transparent formulation of the physics of\ndoped CuO2\u2013planes in terms of \"spin\" and \"hole\" states the latter of which\nare known as Zhang\u2013Rice singlets. In the effective low energy model (\"t\u2013J\nmodel\") obtained this way neighboring \"spins\" experience an exchange interaction J and \"holes\" interchange their position with neighboring \"spins\"\nvia a hopping parameter t [12]. We will show that the leading contribution\nto the nearest neighbor Heisenberg exchange obtained in second order in the\nintersite hopping is sufficient to reproduce the major features found from the\ndirect expansion up to realistic values of tpd , but is not sufficient for perfect\nagreement. Gided by sum rules for the hopping amplitudes in the Wannier\nrepresentation we will then demonstrate how the agreement is systematically\nimproved by including corrections of third and fourth order in the intersite\nhopping. The four\u2013spin (up to sixth order) and further neighbor Heisenberg\nexchange terms will also be discussed in this context.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In the following section the three band\nmodel used in this work is briefly reviewed together with its transformation\ninto the Wannier representation. Section III describes the principles of the\nperturbative derivation of effective Hamiltonians as we will use it. Section\nIV is devoted to the direct expansion with respect to tpd and section V to\nthe expansion in the Wannier representation. The results are summarized\nand conclusions are drawn in connection with the experimental evidence in\nsection VI.\n\n2\n\n\f2\n\nThe three\u2013band model\n\nIn this section we will briefly present the three\u2013band model [2] from which our\ninvestigation is going to start and fix the notations used. For the purpose of\nthis paper which is focusing on the feasibility of high precision determination\nof the parameters of effective spin models we will use a minimum three-band\nmodel with the Hamiltonian\nH = H\u01eb + HU + Hpd\n\n(1)\n\nwhere the first term\nH\u01eb =\n\nX\n\n[\u01ebd d\u2020l,\u03c3 dl,\u03c3 + \u01ebp (p\u2020x,l+nx /2,\u03c3 px,l+nx /2,\u03c3 + p\u2020y,l+ny /2,\u03c3 py,l+ny /2,\u03c3 )]\n\n(2)\n\nl,\u03c3\n\ndescribes the energies of the 3d\u2013 and 2p\u2013holes involved, the second term\nHU = U\n\nX\n\nd\u2020l,\u2191 dl,\u2191d\u2020l,\u2193dl,\u2193\n\n(3)\n\nl\n\ndescribes the Coulomb repulsion of holes on the Cu3+ ions and the third\nterm\nHpd = tpd\n\nX\nl,\u03c3\n\n[d\u2020l,\u03c3 (px,l+nx /2,\u03c3 + py,l+ny /2,\u03c3 \u2212 px,l\u2212nx /2,\u03c3 \u2212 py,l\u2212ny /2,\u03c3 ) + h.c.]. (4)\n\ndescribes the hopping of holes between 3d\u2013 and neighboring 2p\u2013sites. Copper\n3dx2 \u2212y2 \u2013orbitals are placed on a square lattice in the (x, y)\u2013plane which is\nspanned by unit vectors nx and ny and the vertices of which are labeled by\nthe integer vector l. Oxygen 2px \u2013 and 2py \u2013orbitals are placed at the center\nof x\u2013 and y\u2013bonds, respectively, between neighboring lattice sites.\nTypical parameters for the three-band model (1) being used to model\nCuO2\u2013planes are [13, 14]\n.\n\u2206pd = \u01ebp \u2212 \u01ebd = 3.6 eV,\n\nU = 8 eV,\n\ntpd = 1.3 eV.\n\n(5)\n\nFor a direct expansion with respect to the hopping parameter tpd the Hamiltonian (1) is decomposed into\nH = H0p + V p\n\nwith H0p = H\u01eb + HU\n\nand V p = Hpd.\n\n(6)\n\nAlthough the hopping amplitude tpd is smaller than the charge transfer energy\n\u2206pd and than the Coulomb energy U it turns out that a direct expansion of\n3\n\n\fthe parameters of an effective low energy model with respect to tpd , i.e.\nan expansion in powers of V p , does not work for the parameter set (5).\nWe will demonstrate this later explicitly and we will estimate the radius of\nconvergence of such a direct expansion as tcpd \u2248 U/16 = 0.5 eV. We will\ntherefore work out this expansion to higher orders and will extract useful\ninformation from this expansion via Pad\u00e9 approximants.\nZhang and Rice [4] found an elegant way to reorganize the perturbation\nexpansion by reformulating the three\u2013band model in terms of hybridizing\noxygen Wannier orbitals centered at the copper ion sites. The reformulated\nmodel is obtained after transforming the hopping term into momentum space\nrepresentation using the Fourier transformed operators\n1 X \u2212ikl \u2020\nd\u2020l,\u03c3 = \u221a\ne dk,\u03c3\nL k\u2208BZ\nand\n\n1 X \u2212ik(l+n\u03b1 /2) \u2020\ne\np\u03b1,k,\u03c3\np\u2020\u03b1,l+n\u03b1/2,\u03c3 = \u221a\nL k\u2208BZ\n\n(7)\n\n(\u03b1 = x, y),\n\n(8)\n\nwhere L denotes the number of unit cells.

The\nlocal Hamiltonians hl act independently at each site l. They are easily diagonalized exactly.

The separation of energy scales between H0w and\nV w achieved through the use of the Wannier representation is so substantial\nthat it is hard to understand why a controversy about the scenario proposed\nby Zhang and Rice [4] arose early on [15, 16, 17, 18, 19] which was still quoted\nas unsettled in the review by Dagotto [12]. Leading order perturbative calculations using the Wannier representation were performed by many authors\n(see, e.g., [20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26]).\n\n3\n\nPerturbative derivation of effective Hamiltonians\n\nThe perturbative derivation of effective Hamiltonians for correlated electron\nsystems has a long history the early stages of which were summarized by\n6\n\n\fTakahashi in 1977 [6]. In this paper Takahashi presents a particularly transparent description of the method and gives an explicit solution for the effective Hamiltonian to arbitrary order. We will briefly recall Takahashi's\napproach here, because we are going to perform the perturbation expansions\nin this paper using his formulation and because we wish to avoid controversies\nabout the proper use of the method like in [27, 28].\nIt is assumed that the total Hamiltonian of a system is decomposed into\nH = H0 + V.\n\n(22)\n\nIn the case of interest H0 has a degenerate subspace U0 of ground states with\nenergy E0 . On switching on the perturbation V continuously the subspace\nU0 evolves continuously into the subspace U of the corresponding low energy\neigenspace of H. Takahashi presents an explicit perturbative formula to all\norders in V for an isometric linear transformation \u0393: U0 \u2192 U describing the\nmapping of U0 onto U. In terms of \u0393 the effective Hamiltonian is then given\nby\nHeff = \u0393\u2020 H\u0393.\n(23)\nIt acts in the subspace U0 of unperturbed eigenstates of H0 and has the\nsame spectrum as the perturbed Hamiltonian H. In view of the explicit\nperturbation series of \u0393 it is a pure problem of book\u2013keeping to set up the\nperturbation series for Heff to any required order. In terms of the projection\noperator P0 onto the ground state subspace U0 and the resolvent operator\n1 \u2212 P0\n.\nS=\u2212\nH0 \u2212 E0\n\n(24)\n\nthe full perturbation expansion up to fourth order is given by\nHeff = E0 P0 + P0 VP0 + P0 VSVP0\n1\n1\n+P0 VSVSVP0 \u2212 P0 VP0 VS 2 VP0 \u2212 P0 VS 2 VP0 VP0\n2\n2\n1\n1\n+P0 VSVSVSVP0 \u2212 P0 VS 2 VP0 VSVP0 \u2212 P0 VSVP0 VS 2 VP0\n2\n2\n1\n1\n(25)\n+ P0 VP0 VP0 VS 3 VP0 + P0 VS 3 VP0 VP0 VP0\n2\n2\n1\n1\n\u2212 P0 VP0 VS 2 VSVP0 \u2212 P0 VSVS 2 VP0 VP0\n2\n2\n1\n1\n\u2212 P0 VP0 VSVS 2 VP0 \u2212 P0 VS 2 VSVP0 VP0 .\n2\n2\n7\n\n\fFor the purposes of the calculations in this paper we had to list this expansion\nup to twelfth order. The number of terms in the series grows exponentially\nwith the order. To twelfth order the perturbation series contains 363721\nterms.\nFor useful applications of the formal series of Heff the unperturbed Hamiltonian H0 has to be easily diagonalized such that matrix elements of the\nresolvent (24) can be calculated explicitly. In this paper we will apply the\nperturbation expansion to the two Hamiltonian decompositions (6) and (18)\nwere this condition on H0 is satisfied. We also will confine the analysis to\nundoped systems which implies that all terms in Heff containing P0 V P0 don't\ncontribute. This reduces the number of twelfth order terms in Heff to 12341.\nIn the direct expansion based on (6) ground states can only be connected\nby an even number of hopping processes such that all terms with any odd\nnumber of V between two P0 don't contribute. This reduces the number of\ntwelfth order terms to 3180. For the Wannier decomposition (18) our analysis will be confined to sixth order. In this case, of the terms given in (25)\nonly the second order term, the first third order term and the first three\nfourth order terms will contribute and up to sixth order 30 terms have to\nbe taken into account. Notice that in the Wannier decomposition (18) odd\norder terms do contribute since H0w mixes d\u2013 and w\u2013orbitals.\n\n4\n\nDirect perturbation expansion\n\nIn this section we are going to discuss the direct expansion with respect\nto tpd on the basis of the decomposition (6). In the undoped case that we\nare considering here the subspace of ground states U0 of the unperturbed\nHamiltonian H0p contains all states without any p\u2013holes and with a single\nd\u2013hole on each copper site. The effective Hamiltonian acting on U0 is thus\na pure spin Hamiltonian acting on the spins S = 1/2 of the d\u2013sites. Due to\nthe symmetry properties of the three band model (1) this Hamiltonian has\ngot to be invariant under global spin rotations and under the space group\nof the square lattice. Only terms with an even number of spins are possible\ndue to time reversal symmetry. The excited states of H0p are very simple and\nthe excitation energies contain a Coulomb energy U for each d\u2013site with two\nholes and a charge transfer energy \u2206pd for each p\u2013hole. For a contribution of\norder n to the effective Hamiltonian one has to consider all sets of n hopping\nprocesses each of which defines a certain cluster of sites involved. Due to\n8\n\n\fthe linked cluster theorem (which is bound to hold to keep the effective\nHamiltonian extensive) only connected clusters are known to contribute. It\nis therefore sufficient to evaluate the various orders of Heff on certain finite\nclusters. We have implemented the purely symbolic evaluation of the series\nexpansion with a C++ program.\nFor simplicity we will disregard any constant energy shift in Heff since we\nwant to focus on the effective spin Hamiltonian. The leading term in Heff is\nthen a fourth order nearest neighbor Heisenberg exchange J1 S1 * S2 with the\nwell known exchange coupling (see e.g. [20])\n(4)\n\nJ1,dir =\n\n2 t4pd 4\n4 t4pd (U + \u2206pd )\n2\n(\n.\n+\n)\n=\n\u22062pd 2\u2206pd U\nU \u22063pd\n\n(26)\n\nIn order to determine this coupling it is sufficient to calculate the amplitude\nof a spin flip process on a three\u2013site cluster consisting of two neighboring\nd\u2013sites and the p\u2013site in between. In view of the identity S1 * S2 = S1z S2z +\n1\n(S1+ S2\u2212 + S1\u2212 S2+ ) the coupling is given by twice the spin flip amplitude.\n2\nIn sixth order processes the six additional p\u2013sites adjacent to the two\nd\u2013sites can be visited by a hole. Therefore a nine site cluster would be\n(6)\nsufficient to calculate J1,dir . Since in each individual exchange process at\nmost one of the additional p\u2013sites is visited the actual calculation can be\nconfined to clusters of up to no more than four sites. Each of the six four\u2013\nsite clusters gives the same contribution to the sixth order coupling. In one\nsuch contribution either all four sites or only the three sites of the fourth\norder cluster will be involved in the exchange process. Therefore, the sixth\norder spin flip amplitude is given by six times the spin flip amplitude of\nthe four\u2013site cluster minus 5 times the spin flip amplitude of the three\u2013site\ncluster. This type of reasoning would be dispensable in the sixth order case\nfor which it was examplified here, but it is absolutely essential to make the\nhigher order calculations feasible. It allows to reduce the maximum cluster\nsize for the calculation of the nearest neighbor exchange from 17 to 8 in\neighth order, from 31 to 9 in tenth order and from 43 to 12 in twelfth order.\nIn eighth order ring exchange processes on an eight\u2013site plaquette visiting\nfour d\u2013sites are possible. These processes produce four\u2013spin exchange terms\nin Heff . In cases where multi\u2013spin terms are present the fewer\u2013spin exchange\nterms can be inferred in the following way. Partial traces (i.e. traces over\nsome of the spins) of any multi\u2013spin term vanish. By forming the trace over\nsome of the spins belonging to a cluster all exchange terms containing these\n9\n\n\fspins are therefore projected out. Applying this reasoning to the eight\u2013site\nplaquette one obtains the two\u2013spin exchange of a pair of spins by averaging\nover all configurations of the other spins contained in the plaquette. From\ntime reversal invariance and hermiticity of Heff one can infer that the amplitude of a spin flip process remains unchanged if all unflipped spins of a\ncluster are inverted. This allows to reduce by a factor of 2 the number of\nconfigurations needed for the averaging.\nAlong the lines described above we have calculated the nearest neighbor\nexchange coupling J1,dir up to twelfth order in tpd . The full formula of the\ntwelfth order result is given by Eq. (A.1) in Appendix A. Fig. 1 shows how\n(4)\nthe ratio J1,dir /J1,dir varies with increasing tpd if the sixth, eighth, tenth\nand twelfth order terms are included (see the thick lines in Fig. 1). It is\nobvious from this plot that for the physically relevant values of tpd as given\n1.2\n\nU=8 eV, \u2206pd=3.6 eV\n6 th order\n8 th order\n10 th order\n12 th order\n1\u22121 Pade\n1\u22121 DlogP\n2\u22122 Pade\n\n1\n0.8\n\nJ1,dir\n\n\uf8e7\uf8e7\uf8e7\n(4)\n\nJ1,dir\n\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\n1.2\n\n1.4\n\ntpd [eV]\n(4)\n\nFigure 1: Variation of J1,dir /J1,dir with tpd .\n(4)\n\nin (5) J1 is smaller than simple estimates from J1,dir would suggest, but\nit is also obvious that the radius of convergence of the direct perturbation\n10\n\n\fseries considered here is much smaller than tpd = 1.3 eV. The direct series\ndetermines J1 accurately only up to tpd \u2248 0.5 eV. Extrapolations beyond the\nradius of convergence can be obtained, however, via Pad\u00e9 approximants of\n(4)\nthe series for J1,dir /J1,dir . We denote as m-n Pad\u00e9 the approximant with an\nmth order numerator polynomial and an nth order denominator polynomial in\nthe variable x = t2pd . We have also constructed extrapolations via analogous\n(4)\nPad\u00e9 approximants for the logarithmic derivative of J1,dir /J1,dir which we\ndenote by m-n DlogPad\u00e9. The 1-1 and 2-2 Pad\u00e9s and the 1-1 DlogPad\u00e9\nshown by the thin lines in Fig. 1 demonstrate the excellent convergence of\nthis extrapolation procedure. The 0-1, 1-3 and 1-2 Pad\u00e9s and the 1-2 and\n2-1 DlogPad\u00e9s are not shown because they all differ from the 2-2 Pad\u00e9 by\nless than 3% for tpd \u2264 1.3 eV and less than 4% for tpd \u2264 1.5 eV. From this\nobservation we derive the estimate that they determine the nearest neighbor\nexchange coupling with an accuracy of better than 4%. Note the substantial\n(4)\nreduction of the coupling in the range of physical interest, J1 = 0.33 J1,dir for\ntpd = 1.3 eV, in comparison to the lowest order result.\nThe four\u2013spin exchange terms which first appear in eighth order can be\ninferred from considering processes in which all four spins are flipped. Let\nus label the spins on the four d\u2013sites of a square plaquette in cyclic order by\nnumbers 1 to 4. There are 3 independent four\u2013spin invariants, (S1 *S2 )(S3 *S4 ),\n(S2 * S3 )(S4 * S1 ) and (S1 * S3 )(S2 * S4 ) from which the four\u2013spin exchange\nterms have to be formed. Due to the square point symmetry of our model\nthe first two invariants always get the same exchange coupling in the effective\nHamiltonian. This common coupling is given by twice the amplitude of the\nprocess which flips all spins of the initial state |1 \u2191, 2 \u2193, 3 \u2191, 4 \u2193i, since the\nthird invariant doesn't contribute to this process. The exchange coupling of\nthe third invariant can be inferred from considering an alternative four\u2013spin\nflip process starting from the initial state |1 \u2191, 2 \u2193, 3 \u2193, 4 \u2191i. The sum of the\ncouplings of the first invariant and the third invariant is given by four times\nthe amplitude of this process. It turns out that this amplitude vanishes in\neighth and tenth order. This implies that up to tenth order the four\u2013spin\nexchange term has the form\nh\n\nJ\u2737 (S1 * S2 )(S3 * S4 ) + (S2 * S3 )(S4 * S1 ) \u2212 (S1 * S3 )(S2 * S4 )\n\ni\n\n(27)\n\nin analogy to what is known for the one band Hubbard model in fourth order\n[6].\nThe vanishing of the |1 \u2191, 2 \u2193, 3 \u2193, 4 \u2191i spin flip process up to tenth order can\nbe easily understood as resulting from the linked cluster theorem, because for\n11\n\n\fthese processes the plaquette (1,2,3,4) decomposes into two unlinked clusters,\none of them containing the d\u2013sites 1 and 2, the other containing sites 3 and 4.\nIn twelfth order there are processes linking these two clusters and producing\nanother four\u2013spin term\nJ\u00d7 (S1 * S3 )(S2 * S4 )\n(28)\n\nin addition to (27). It has to be noted that in twelfth order clusters containing 6 d\u2013sites are created which produce six\u2013spin terms in the effective\nHamiltonian. In the calculation of the four\u2013spin terms these six\u2013spin terms\nhave to be properly eliminated by the averaging procedure described above.\nThe eighth order coupling constant of the four\u2013spin term (27) is found to\nbe\n80 t8pd (U + \u2206pd ) (U 2 + U \u2206pd + \u22062pd )\n(8)\nJ\u2737,dir =\n.\n(29)\nU 3 \u22067pd\n\nCorrections up to fourteenth order are shown by Eq. (A.2) in Appendix\nA together with the leading order contribution for J\u00d7 in Eq. (A.3). The\n(8)\nvariation of J\u2737,dir/J\u2737,dir with increasing tpd is shown in Fig. 2. Here, the 03 Pad\u00e9 (not shown) and the 1-2 and the 2-1 Pad\u00e9s as well as the 1-1 DlogPad\u00e9\nseem to provide a rather accurate estimate with an uncertainty of about \u00b16%\nfor tpd = 1.3 eV and an uncertainty of about \u00b115% for tpd = 1.5 eV. For\ntpd = 1.3 eV the coupling J\u2737 is about 10 times smaller than suggested by the\nleading order term. We will consider the 1-1 DlogPad\u00e9 the most probable\n(8)\nestimate of J\u2737,dir/J\u2737,dir.\nThe leading contributions to second neighbor Heisenberg exchange terms\nlike J2 S(0,0) * S(1,1) and to third neighbor Heisenberg exchange terms like\nJ3 S(0,0) * S(0,2) are also obtained in eighth order.

The 1-1 Pad\u00e9 in Fig. 3 might indicate that J2 changes\nsign slightly below tpd = 1 eV, but the scattering of the various approximants\ndoesn't allow definite conclusions on a change of sign. Since the 0-1 DlogPad\u00e9 (not shown in Fig. 3) coincides to high precision with the 0-2 Pad\u00e9 we\nwill consider this approximant as the most probable estimate for J2 .

Altogether, the Pad\u00e9 approximants for J2 and J3 scatter much more than those\nfor J1 and J\u2737 and provide less accurate estimates for J2 and J3 . We do,\nhowever, learn from these extrapolations that for tpd = 1.3 eV both J2 and\nJ3 also are reduced substantially in comparison to the leading order results\n(30) and (31), J2 probably by a factor of as much as 10 and J3 probably by\na factor of 5.

In the range of physically relevant model parameters the\nfour\u2013spin coupling J\u2737 is by far the largest correction to the nearest neighbor\ntwo\u2013spin coupling J1 . The second and third neighbor Heisenberg couplings J2\nand J3 are much smaller and are in fact comparable to the six\u2013spin coupling\nJ\u2741\u2742 . This scenario agrees with what is known from perturbation expansions\nfor the single band Hubbard model [6, 28] and from cluster calculations for\nthe three band model [9].\nA quantitative comparison of the best approximants for the various couplings with J1 (represented by its 2-2 Pad\u00e9) is shown in Fig. 6 where we\nhave denoted the m-n Pad\u00e9 for the coupling Ji by Ji [m, n]. For the model\nparameters (5), J\u2737 is almost one order of magnitude smaller than J1 and\nthe couplings J2 and J3 are almost another order of magnitude smaller.

The\nunperturbed Hamiltonian (20) consists of independent local Hamiltonians hl\nfor each site which are easily diagonalized. In the one hole sector the local\nHamiltonian has two S = 1/2 eigenstates where mutually orthogonal linear\ncombinations of d\u2013hole and w\u2013hole orbitals are occupied. The two hole sector contains a non\u2013hybridized S = 1 triplet and three hybridized singlets the\nlowest one of which is the Zhang\u2013Rice singlet. In the three hole sector again\ntwo S = 1/2 doublets are found. The four hole sector and the zero hole sector\neach contain one trivial S = 0 state. The lower doublet in the one hole sector\nacts as the local ground state doublet of the undoped system.

We have diagonalized the local Hamiltonian numerically. A simple analytic formula cannot\nbe obtained in the general case since for the three singlets in the two hole\nsector a (3\u00d73)\u2013matrix has to be diagonalized. Simple analytic expressions\nfor the solution in this sector would be available only in the symmetric case\n\u2206pd = U/2. The perturbation expansion with respect to (21) was performed\nusing a combination of symbolic and numerical routines.\nIt is instructive to analyse the radius of convergence tcpd of the local Hamiltonian hl which does depend on tpd via (19). This radius of convergence can\nbe determined from studying the branch points of the eigenvalues of the local Hamiltonian in the complex tpd \u2013plane. Without going into any details\nwe wish to summarize this analysis here by stating that tcpd = 0.469 eV for\nthe values of U and \u2206pd given in (5). This value agrees well with the values estimated from the Pad\u00e9 approximants. This is not surprising since the\nexpansion with respect to the small perturbation (21) is expected to converge well and should not much modify tcpd as defined above from the local\n17\n\n\fHamiltonian.\n1.2\n\nU=8 eV, \u2206pd=3.6 eV\n2nd order\n3rd order\n4th order\n2\u22122 Pade\n\n1\n0.8\n\nJ1,w\n\n\uf8e7\uf8e7\uf8e7\n(4)\n\nJ1,dir\n\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\n1.2\n\n1.4\n\ntpd [eV]\n(4)\n\nFigure 7: Variation of J1,w /J1,dir with tpd .\nIn what follows we will plot the variation of the various coupling constants\nwith the hopping tpd in analogy to the presentations in the previous figures\nby measuring all couplings in units of their lowest order term in the direct\nexpansion (if not otherwise stated). Fig. 7 shows our results for the nearest\nneighbor exchange J1,w . In the present context the leading contribution to\nJ1,w is obtained from the simple second order hopping process described by\nthe term P0 VSVP0 of (25). This second order contribution is depicted by the\nthick dotted line in Fig. 7. It is satisfying that this simple second order result\n(4)\nreproduces quite nicely the decrease of J1 /J1,dir with increasing tpd as given\nby the Pad\u00e9 approximants of Fig. 1. On the other hand, there is, however,\na systematic deviation in the overall size of the coupling; even for small tpd\n(2)\nthe coupling J1,w is too large by about 15%. The discrepancy at small tpd\nis largely reduced by taking into account the third order terms derived from\n(4)\nP0 VSVSVP0 and, finally, J1,w is in satisfying agreement with the 2-2 Pad\u00e9\n18\n\n\f1.4\n\nU=8 eV, \u2206pd=3.6 eV\n\n1.2\n\n4 th order\n5 th order\n6 th order\n1\u22121 DlogP\n\n1\n\nJ\u274f ,w 0.8\n\n\uf8e7\uf8e7\uf8e7\n(8)\n\nJ\u274f ,dir 0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n1\n\n0.8\n\n1.2\n\n1.4\n\ntpd [eV]\n(8)\n\nFigure 8: Variation of J\u2737,w /J\u2737,dir with tpd .\n(2)\n\n(4)\n\nof the direct expansion. The deviation of J1,w from J1,dir for small tpd is\n(2)\nexplained quantitatively by re\u2013expanding J1,w to second order with respect\nto t0 . Referring to (19) we obtain\n(2)\n\n(4)\n\nJ1,w \u223c (2T(0,0) T(1,0) )2 J1,dir\n\n(tpd \u2192 0)\n\n(33)\n(4)\n\nwhich explains the 15% deviation because (2T(0,0) T(1,0) )2 = 1.153. Since J1,w\n(4)\ncollects all fourth order terms it has to coincide with J1,dir after re\u2013expanding\nit to t4pd . How this happens becomes particularly clear if one looks at the\nsum rule s(1,0) of (14). This sum rule states that 2T(0,0) T(1,0) + r(1,0) = \u22121 if\nwe denote by r(1,0) the sum of all terms in s(1,0) (infinitely many) which don't\ncontain T(0,0) . Squaring this sum rule we obtain the relation\n2\n(2T(0,0) T(1,0) )2 + 2(2T(0,0) T(1,0) )r(1,0) + r(1,0)\n=1\n\n(34)\n\nfrom which we can read off the contributions of various orders of the Wannier\n(4)\nexpansion to J1,dir in the limit of small tpd . The first term represents the\n19\n\n\f(2)\n\ncontribution of J1,w discussed above. The second term contains only one\nfactor of T(0,0) and results from third order terms in V w which due to r(1,0) =\n2\n0.073775 exhaust the relation (34) to 1 \u2212 r(1,0)\n= 0.994557; this explains\n(3)\n\n(4)\n\nwhy J1,w is slightly smaller than J1,dir in the limit of small tpd (see Fig. 7).\n2\nFinally, the term r(1,0)\ncomes from fourth order terms in V w which contribute\nonly about 0.5% for small tpd but change sign and get more important as tpd\nincreases.\nIn our calculation of third and fourth order contributions to J1,w we have\nmade extensive use of the sum rule s(1,0) . In third order terms the exchange\npath for a spin flip process involves an arbitrary third copper ion site whose\nspin is not flipped. The sum of the spin flip amplitudes over all these third\nsites contains a lattice sum which is simply r(1,0) . The calculation of the\nfourth order is more involved since one has to discriminate between spin flip\nprocesses which don't visit another site and those which visit one or two\nmore sites. The lattice sums appearing in this order cannot be completely\ndetermined from sum rules, but sum rules considerably simplify their calculation. Four\u2013spin terms which here appear in fourth order are eliminated by\naveraging as described in the previous section.\nResults for the four\u2013spin coupling J\u2737,w are shown in Fig. 8. The leading\nfourth order contribution again nicely reproduces qualitatively the decrease\nwith increasing tpd known from Fig. 2. After the above discussion the deviation observed in the small tpd limit is not surprising. In fact, a quantitative\nunderstanding of this deviation follows from looking at the fourth power of\nthe s(1,0) sum rule: (2T(0,0) T(1,0) +r(1,0) )4 = 1. With (2T(0,0) T(1,0) )4 = 1.329 we\n(4)\nunderstand why J\u2737,w\nis about 33% too large for small tpd . The substantial reduction of the deviation by the fifth order contributions are also understood\nquantitatively from the identity (2T(0,0) T(1,0) )4 + 4(2T(0,0) T(1,0) )3 r(1,0) = 0.964\n(see Fig. 8). Including the sixth order terms we find the almost negligible de2\nviation of (2T(0,0) T(1,0) )4 + 4(2T(0,0) T(1,0) )3 r(1,0) + 6(2T(0,0) T(1,0) )2 r(1,0)\n= 1.0017\nand the overall agreement with the 1-1 DlogPad\u00e9 is quite satisfying.\nThe analysis of the second and third neighbor exchange J2 and J3 is\nmore complicated in the Wannier representation since there are low order\ncontributions which have to be cancelled completely by higher order terms\nbefore results of any significance emerge. We therefore show these couplings\nin Figs. 9 and 10 not in units of their eighth order counterparts from the\n(4)\ndirect expansion but in units of J1,dir . It is quite obvious that for any lattice\n(2)\nvector l there is a second order contribution Jl,w to the Heisenberg coupling\n20\n\n\f0.04\n\nU=8 eV, \u2206pd=3.6 eV\n\n0.03\n0.02\n\nJ2,w\n\n0.01\n\n\uf8e7\uf8e7\uf8e7\n(4)\n\n0\n\nJ1,dir\n\u22120.01\n2 nd order\n3 rd order\n4 th order\n0\u22122 Pade\n\n\u22120.02\n\u22120.03\n\u22120.04\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\n1.2\n\n1.4\n\ntpd [eV]\n(4)\n\nFigure 9: Variation of J2,w /J1,dir with tpd .\nbetween two spins separated by l which in analogy to (33) behaves like\n(2)\n\n(4)\n\nJl,w \u223c (2T(0,0) Tl )2 J1,dir\n\n(tpd \u2192 0).\n\n(35)\n\nThe cancellation of this contribution by higher order terms is understood by\ninvoking the sum rule 2T(0,0) Tl + rl = 0 for further neighbors which squared\ngives the relation\n(2T(0,0) Tl )2 + 2(2T(0,0) Tl )rl + rl2 = 0.\n\n(36)\n\nThe numbers (2T(0,0) T(1,1) )2 = 0.0325 and (2T(0,0) T(2,0) )2 = 0.0111 coin(2)\n(2)\ncide perfectly with the behavior of J2,w and J3,w for small tpd as shown in\nFigs. 9 and 10. We also understand from (36) why the inclusion of the third\norder doesn't reduce the deviation from 0 but just changes its sign. In fourth\norder Fig. 9 shows that in agreement with (36) the terms proportional to t4pd\nin J2,w vanish. This is, however, only a partial solution of the cancellation\nproblem since there are still terms proportional to t6pd which according to\n21\n\n\f0.02\n\nU=8 eV, \u2206pd=3.6 eV\n\n0.01\n\nJ3,w\n\n\uf8e7\uf8e7\uf8e7\n(4)\n\n0\n\nJ1,dir\n2 nd order\n3 rd order\n4 th order\n0\u22121 DlogP\n\n\u22120.01\n\n\u22120.02\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\n1.2\n\n1.4\n\ntpd [eV]\n(4)\n\nFigure 10: Variation of J3,w /J1,dir with tpd .\nFig. 9 even have the wrong sign and cancellation of which would only be\nachieved by extending the V w expansion to sixth order. For tpd > 0.8 eV\nthe third and fourth order results shown in Figs. 9 and 10 at least have the\nright sign and the same order of magnitude as the Pad\u00e9 estimates from the\nprevious section. We have to conclude that the accurate determination of the\nfurther neighbor couplings J2 and J3 in the Wannier representation would be\nvery demanding. This points at definite limitations of this approach.\n\n6\n\nConclusions\n\nIn the present paper we have discussed the derivation of high precision effective spin Hamiltonians for the low energy sector of a three band model for\nCuO2\u2013planes. By two methods we have demonstrated that it is possible to\novercome the convergence problems of the tpd perturbation series. Using the\ndirect expansion with respect to tpd we have derived precise values for the\n22\n\n\fmost important couplings via Pad\u00e9 approximants. The direct expansion has\nthe advantage of a particularly simple unperturbed Hamiltonian and a very\nnicely localized perturbative Hamiltonian which makes high order symbolic\nexpansions feasible. Using the Wannier representation we have confirmed\nthe results from the direct expansion by a method with much better convergence properties. The expansion in the Wannier representation is, however,\nrendered more difficult by a more complicated unperturbed Hamiltonian and\na less well localized perturbative Hamiltonian and by the necessity of a non\u2013\nsymbolic (i.e. numerical) series expansion. We have also shown that for\nprecise values of the coupling constants the leading orders of the Wannier\nexpansion are not sufficient.\nThe work in the present paper was confined to the most rudimentary\nthree band model since our main goal was to demonstrate the feasibility of\nthe derivation of accurate effective Hamiltonians. Nevertheless we will use\nour results here for a fit of the couplings J1 = 151.9 meV and J\u2737 /J1 = 0.24 extracted recently from a fit to the experimental dispersion of La2 CuO4 [11] using self consistent spin\u2013wave theory [10]. Assuming the typical (though somewhat arbitrary) model parameters U = 8 eV and \u2206pd = 3.6 eV from (5) we\nobtain from the value J1 = 151.9 meV the estimate 1.422 eV \u2264 tpd \u2264 1.454 eV\nfor the hopping parameter of the minimum model showing an uncertainty in\ntpd of 2% due to the uncertainty of our Pad\u00e9 extrapolations. With tpd in this\nrange our estimate for J\u2737 results in 0.19 \u2264 J\u2737 /J1 \u2264 0.25 which is in good\nagreement with the result from [10].\nFor proper applications to cuprate materials this work will have to be\nextended to more realistic three band models including, in particular, a direct\noxygen\u2013oxygen hopping tpp [13, 14]. The relevance of four\u2013spin exchange has\nbeen stressed also for the two\u2013leg ladder system La6 Ca8 Cu24 O41 [30] to which\nthe analysis presented here can be applied as well.\n\nAcknowledgement\nThe authors gratefully acknowledge useful discussions with Christian Knetter and Kai Schmidt.
