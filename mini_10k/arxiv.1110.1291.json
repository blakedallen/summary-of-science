Whereas in the early\ndays of Doppler mapping, intensity spectra only were used\nto derive abundance maps (see e.g. Rice et al. 1989), the\naddition of spectra in circular polarisation (Stokes V ) soon\nopened up the possibility to simultaneously determine both\nthe magnetic field structure and the abundance distributions of various chemical elements. However, right in the\nfirst days of ZDM Brown et al. (1991) gave a caveat: linear\n\n?\n\nrecondite: dealing with very profound, difficult, or abstruse\nsubject matter; requiring special knowledge to be understood\n(http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/recondite)\n\npolarisation data (Stokes Q and U ) would be needed to derive reliable magnetic maps for Ap stars. Still, even into the\nnew millennium, Doppler maps of magnetic stars have been\npublished, based on Stokes I and V only (Kochukhov et al.\n2002, L\u00fcftinger et al. 2010), although instruments capable\nof determining accurate Q and U profiles have by now been\ndeveloped. Numerous Doppler maps of magnetic stars even\nrely solely on Stokes I (Piskunov et al. 1998, Kuschnig et\nal. 1998, L\u00fcftinger et al. 1998, 2003). The reader of the articles cited will surely note that elemental over-abundances\nresulting from Doppler imaging frequently appear quite unrealistic. Consider for example the results for \u03b9 Cas where according to Kuschnig et al. (1998) in parts of the atmosphere\nlog (NCr /Ntot ) = \u22121.50. Similarly, for \u03ba Psc, Piskunov et\nal. (1998) find that over a considerable part of the surface\nlog (NF e /Ntot ) = \u22121.81, while Cr, according to their figure 1, varies between \u22126.09 and 0.27! For comparison, the\n\n\f2\n\nM.J. Stift, F. Leone and C.R. Cowley\n\nsolar abundance is \u22125.6 (Asplund et al. 2009).The question not only arises how possibly a star can contain more\nchromium than hydrogen in parts of its atmosphere but also\nhow such an enormous over-abundance could build up and\nwhether such an atmosphere could ever remain stable. Note\nthat the modelling of equilibrium stratifications in Ap stars\n(LeBlanc et al. 2009, Alecian & Stift 2007) has not so far\nyielded a single case with such extreme iron or chromium\nabundances. Could these excessive values not rather be due\nto serious shortcomings in the ZDM procedure?\nFortunately, high quality Stokes QU profiles have now\nbecome available and this might be thought to ensure at\nlast uniqueness of the magnetic and abundance maps. Based\non recently obtained Stokes IQU V profiles, a major revision both of the previously published magnetic geometry\nand of the elemental abundance distributions of the famous\nAp star \u03b12 CVn has taken place. The new maps appear to\nvalidate the analysis of Brown et al. (1991). Whereas the\nStokes I and V based analysis by Kochukhov et al. (2002)\n(=K02) yielded a minimum field of \u22126.5 kG and a maximum\nfield of +5.1 kG, these values have now become \u22123.5 kG and\n+3.5 kG respectively (Kochukhov & Wade 2010) (=K10);\nwe see also substantial changes in the structure both of the\nmeridional and the azimuthal field. The respective field distributions from K02 and K10 at phases 0.20 and 0.40 are\nstrikingly different and it is quite surprising to see that a\nsharp maximum in field strength is accompanied by an almost horizontal inclination of the magnetic field.\nThe K10 iron maps bear little resemblance to the K02\nmaps, and there are a few noticeable differences in the\nchromium maps; there is no obvious correlation between\nfield direction or strength and the abundance features. A\n2.3 dex amplitude in the Fe abundances has increased to\na staggering 4.9 dex, a fact that cannot be explained by\nmagnetic intensification (see Stift & Leone 2003). However,\nthere are not only these differences between the old and the\nnew maps that are distressing, but there is also the question of (optimum) regularisation. In an ill-posed problem\nsuch as ZDM, regularisation is necessary to obtain meaningful and hopefully unique maps of elemental abundances\nand of the magnetic field vector; these maps should combine minimum structure (complexity) with a good fit to the\nobserved Stokes IQU V profiles. In the past, maximum entropy regularisation has been used extensively (see e.g. Vogt\net al. 1987), but nowadays it is largely replaced by Tikhonov\nregularisation which minimises the sum of the squared differences between the unknowns (abundances, magnetic field\ncomponents) of any combination of 2 surface elements (see\neq. 5 of K10). Please keep in mind that both Tikhonov and\nmaximum entropy regularisation are purely mathematical\nconstraints which do not necessarily reflect the physical reality: radiatively driven diffusion in magnetic stellar atmospheres might not lead to smooth but rather to patchy surface structure (Alecian & Stift 2010).\nEven with all 4 Stokes parameters used by K10, the\nmagnetic geometry depends in a sensitive way and to an\nuncanny degree on the value of the regularisation parameter.\nObviously, the smaller the latter gets, the more fine structure\nin the magnetic field appears, but in addition, changes in the\nregularisation parameter make field maxima not only change\nappreciably in value but these maxima also appear to travel\nover substantial distances to new locations (compare figures\n\nFigure 1. Variations, as a function of iron abundance, in the run\nof temperature with log \u03c45000 in an Atlas12 model atmosphere\nwith Teff = 12000 K, log g = 4.0 (all other elements have solar\nabundances). The curves pertain to iron abundances ranging from\nA(Fe) = 6.50 to 10.50 and are plotted relative to the temperature\nprofile of the A(Fe) = 7.50 model.\n\n6 and 8 in K10). In that context the reader of the K10 paper,\nhaving access to abundance maps for only 2 values of the\nregularisation parameter, is certainly entitled to ask himself\nwhether this travel proceeds smoothly or rather in erratic\njumps. The reader will also note that Stokes Q and U data\nfor a mere 3 or 4 out of 20 phases are mainly responsible\nfor the complete revision of the surface abundance and field\nstrength maps (this will be discussed in section 7) while\nthere are still a lot of profiles that have not been fitted to\nwithin the estimated observational errors.\nApparently the method used by K10 is not robust, since\nthe results depend too strongly on the value of the regularisation parameter. As K10 have shown themselves in their\nfigures 6 and 8, the value of the regularisation parameter\nnot only determines the resolution of the maps \u2013 as one\nwould ideally expect \u2013 but to an uncomfortable degree also\ntheir large-scale structure. Is this fact due to some numerical instability and/or to weird behaviour of the Tikhonov\nregularisation, or is it rather indicative of something even\nmore disturbing, i.e. do we have to admit that the input\nphysics used so far by K10 are seriously inadequate? Could\nit be that the ZDM code yields a beautiful, but incorrect and\nunphysical solution that also depends on erroneous assumptions as to, for example, the atmospheric structure? This is\nwhat we will explore in the following sections.\n\n2\n\nTHE TOOLS\n\nAny thorough investigation of ZDM and its input physics\nrequires a set of powerful numerical codes. One has to be\nable to calculate highly accurate Stokes profiles for stellar\n\n\fThe recondite intricacies of Zeeman Doppler mapping\natmospheres permeated by strong magnetic fields of various\ngeometries. There is the need for opacity sampled stellar\natmospheres which allow for arbitrary, perhaps even vertically stratified, elemental abundances. The spectra of spotted stars have to be calculated using at least 2 different atmospheric models (for a single spot) but more flexible and\nrealistic abundance patterns may have to make use of many\nmore model atmospheres, up to 10 and even more. Finally\nit is useful to be able to verify how (Zeeman) Doppler maps\nreflect or fail to reflect any spotted structure adopted in the\nsynthesis of Stokes profiles of magnetic stars.\nAll but one of the codes used in our investigation are\nbased on Cossam which stands for \"Codice per la sintesi\nspettrale nelle atmosfere magnetiche\" described herewith.\nParts of Cossam can be traced back to Adrs3 (Chmielewski\n1979) which itself is an evolved version of the Fortran adaptation by Peytremann et al. (1967) of the Algol 60 code\nAnalyse 65 by Baschek et al. (1966). Cossam and all the\nother codes are written in Ada, an object-oriented language\nwhose syntax derives from the Algol family of languages and\nwhich is used mainly for safety-critical applications such as\nflight software but is also eminently suitable for scientific\ncomputing. Ada makes it possible to achieve a remarkably\nhigh degree of portability, its encapsulated software modules (\"packages\") allow extensive verbatim software reuse,\nand there are unique language constructs (\"tasks\") for concurrent processing which can be employed for highly efficient\nparallel computing with very little synchronisation overhead\nthanks to \"protected types\". Finally it should be mentioned\nthat free Ada compilers of the same quality as those provided for EADS or Boeing are provided free of charge and\nare included in every Linux distribution. For more details\nsee Stift (1998, 2000) and Wade et al. (2001).\nCossam is a code that calculates full Stokes IQU V profiles in local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) either for the\nsolar case (at a given point on the solar surface) or for the\nstellar case (integral over the visible hemisphere). Atomic\ntransition data are usually taken from the VALD database\n(Piskunov et al. 1995, Kupka et al. 1999), and often include\nthe constants for radiation damping, Stark broadening and\nvan der Waals broadening. When these constants are unavailable, classical radiation damping and Uns\u00f6ld van der\nWaals broadening are taken, together with Stark broadening\naccording to Gonzalez et al. (1995). For the Voigt and Faraday profiles of the metal lines the complex rational function\ngiven by Hui et al. (1978) is used; the hydrogen line profiles are calculated by means of the approximation found in\nTlusty (Hubeny & Lanz 1995). Zeeman splittings are calculated from the J-values of the lower and upper energy levels respectively and their Land\u00e9 factors; in case these data\nare lacking, a simple Zeeman triplet is assumed. In order\nto establish the line absorption matrix in the polarised radiative transfer equation, full opacity sampling is carried\nout, separately for the \u03c3\u2212 , \u03c3+ and \u03c0 components. The required continuous opacities come from the Atlas12 (Kurucz 2005) routines translated to Ada and encapsulated in\na reusable multi-purpose package. Special care is applied\nto the treatment of the Lyman, Balmer and Paschen discontinuities according to the level dissolution probability\nmethod of Hubeny et al. (1994). The formal solution to the\npolarised RTE is carried out using the Zeeman Feautrier\nmethod (Auer et al. 1977, Alecian & Stift 2004) or the DELO\n\n3\n\nmethod (Rees et al. 1989). Spatial integration of the local\nStokes profiles over the visible hemisphere can take advantage of an optimum grid due to Stift (1985). Opacity sampling, the most time-consuming part of the code, is entirely\nand efficiently parallelised and so allows one to take full advantage of the power of modern symmetric multi-processing\n(SMP) machines of 1-48 cores and more, all of this without\nhaving recourse to MPI or to related software libraries.\nCossamSpot is a code derived from Cossam that calculates full Stokes IQU V profiles for stars doted with as many\nas 10 spots. As we shall show below, atomic transition data\nhave to be accommodated not just for 1 atmosphere but for\nup to 10 atmospheres (or even more). Thanks to the objectorientation of Ada this can be done in a straightforward way\nthrough the use of generic packages which constitute templates (in the C++ diction) that can be instantiated with\nactual parameters. It thus becomes possible to model e.g.\nthe spectrum of a star with a number of spots each of which\nis made up of concentric rings of different abundance and/or\ntemperature. Clearly, spotted stars require a grid that is different from the observer-centred grid used in Cossam: here\nwe have a co-rotating grid where the whole surface of the\nstar is split into elements of about equal area (for a typical\nsuch grid see e.g. figure 1 in Vogt et al. 1987).\nFor the stellar atmosphere models we rely on the\nAtlas12 code (Kurucz 2005), translated to Ada by Bischof\n(2005) and offering a restricted number of Kurucz's original options; the code has subsequently been thoroughly debugged by Stift and now offers most of the original options.\nAtlasAda makes provisions for stratified atmospheres and\nthanks to the parallelisation of the opacity sampling part,\ncan provide excellent frequency resolution. Apart from these\n2 improvements and from better defined interfaces to the\nsubprograms, the input physics are identical to those of the\nofficial Fortran version.\nFinally, the Doppler mapping code by Stift (1996) has\nbeen completely rewritten and is now based on the latest\nversion of Cossam. At the time of writing, CossamDoppler\nderives abundance maps from Stokes I profiles only; the\nmagnetic field geometry is taken into account but has \u2013\nfor our tests \u2013 to be the same as the input geometry to\nCossamSpot. Maximum entropy regularisation is combined\nwith a simple gradient search, ensuring convergence to the\ndesired high-quality fit to the intensity profile within 6-10\niterations in favourable circumstances.\n\n3\n\nTHE PICKET-FENCE MODEL AND\nATLAS12 STELLAR ATMOSPHERES\n\nThe repercussions of line blanketing on the structure of a\nstellar atmosphere were treated in an analytical way by\nChandrasekhar (1935). His so-called picket-fence model is\nbased on the assumptions of a frequency-independent continuum opacity, of lines distributed randomly and uniformly\nover the spectrum, and of a constant opacity ratio between the lines (with square profiles) and the continuum\n\u2013 for a very readable presentation of this method see Mihalas (1970). Chandrasekhar showed that with increasing line\nopacity, the temperature gradient increases, and the temperature at the upper boundary of the atmosphere decreases.\nLater numerical approaches allowed for more realistic spec-\n\n\f4\n\nM.J.

Cowley\neffective temperature in the presence of heavy blanketing.\nNote the nice depression around 5200 \u00c5 which develops for\nA(Fe) > 10.00 and which is probably related to the well\nknown feature used to define a peculiarity index (Maitzen\n1976). Given the large differences in atmospheric structure,\ncan we expect spectral line shapes to be insensitive to metallicity effects?\n\n4\n\nFigure 2. Line blanketed spectra for Atlas12 model atmospheres\nwith Teff = 12000 K, log g = 4.0 and varying iron abundances.\nFor all other elements, solar abundances have been assumed.\nMeans of the specific intensity at the centre of the disk (in\nergs cm\u22122 s\u22121 Hz\u22121 sr\u22121 ) have been calculated over 8 \u00c5 intervals. The curves pertain \u2013 from bottom to top \u2013 to A(Fe) =\n7.50, 8.00, 8.50, 9.00, 9.50, 10.00, 10.25, 10.50.\n\ntral line distributions, starting with 30000 lines for Procyon\n(Strom & Kurucz 1966) and going up to millions of lines\n(Kurucz & Bell 1995); they give a very detailed idea of how\nimportant line blocking and backwarming can become and\nhow these affect the structure of a stellar atmosphere.\nChandrasekhar's picket-fence model is an astrophysical\nclassic but nobody seems to have spent much thought on\nit in the context of ZDM. So let us investigate what fully\nline-blanketed atmospheres calculated with Atlas12 (Kurucz 2005) look like for the extreme abundances, especially\nof iron, claimed by K10 for \u03b12 CVn. For this purpose we have\nestablished a grid of models with Teff = 12000 K, log g = 4.0,\nand with iron abundances that cover a wide range, viz.\nA(Fe) = 6.50, 7.00, 7.50, 8.00, 8.50, 9.00, 9.50, 10.00, 10.25\nand 10.50 (on a scale where the hydrogen abundance is\n12.00). For simplicity's sake we took solar abundances for\nall the other elements, allowing us to single out the effects of\njust 1 parameter. Convergence of the models with large overabundances turned out to be excruciatingly slow at times\nand it also proved necessary to proceed in small steps from\nA(Fe) = 9.00 to A(Fe) = 10.00 and beyond in order to obtain any convergence at all. Thanks to the parallelised Ada\nversion of Atlas12 we could afford satisfactory sampling\nwith 120000 frequency points. Fig. 1 clearly illustrates how\nthe temperature gradient steepens with increasing metallicity, and how at log \u03c45000 = 2.0, the bottom of the atmosphere\ngets hotter whereas the top at log \u03c45000 = \u22125.3 becomes\ncooler, at least up to moderate metallicities. Let us point\nout that the differences between the curves for A(Fe) = 6.50\nand A(Fe) = 8.00 are smaller than the differences between\nthe curves for A(Fe) = 10.00 and A(Fe) = 10.25! In order to illustrate the vast changes in line blocking between\nA(Fe) = 7.50 and A(Fe) = 10.50 over the interval covered\nby the metal lines used in K10 we plot in Fig. 2 Stokes I\nspecific intensity means over 8 \u00c5 intervals. At these wavelengths, the continuum of the A(Fe) = 10.50 atmosphere lies\nconsiderably above the continuum of the A(Fe) = 7.50 atmosphere in order to ensure constant total flux for the given\n\nLINE SHAPES AND SIMPLE ARITHMETICS\n\nNotwithstanding the ground-breaking work of Chandrasekhar (1935), differential line-blanketing \u2013 between spot\nand photosphere \u2013 in stellar atmospheres has never been\ntaken into account by Doppler mapping experts. Especially\nfor recent work this seems a bit strange since Khan &\nShulyak (2007) have shown the non-negligible effects of\nFe and Cr over-abundances on stellar atmospheres and on\nabundance estimates. True, for very small abundance differences over the stellar surface it is absolutely tolerable\nto approximate the \"local atmospheres\" by an atmosphere\ncorresponding to the mean metallicity (but see below for\nthe definition of \"very small\"). However, in the light of the\nfindings of Khan & Shulyak (2007) it is certainly time to\nchallenge this mean atmosphere assumption in those cases\nwhen iron abundances attain and exceed A(Fe) = 9.50, and\nto show that line profiles calculated with the corresponding\nhigh-metallicity atmospheres differ significantly from those\ncalculated for example with a A(Fe) = 7.50 or even a\nA(Fe) = 8.50 atmosphere.\nFor this purpose, Fig. 3 displays, for the \u03bb 4924 iron\nline (plus actual blending lines) at the centre of the\nA\nA\nstellar disk, normalised intensity differences I850\n\u2212 IA\nfor various adopted Fe abundances A(Fe). The subscript\nstands for the iron abundance adopted in the establishment of the stellar atmosphere, the superscript for the\nactual iron abundance assumed for the spectral synthesis. The abundance grid for this test covered A(Fe) =\n7.50, 8.00, 8.50, 9.00, 9.50, 10.00, 10.25, 10.50. In the lower\npanel we plot the non-magnetic intensity differences, in the\nupper panel the differences for a 4400 G field inclined by\n90\u25e6 with respect to the line-of-sight. For A(Fe) = 10.00\nthe differences attain about 5% of the continuum both in\nthe non-magnetic and in the magnetic case, and they get\nsubstantially larger (more than 10%) with increasing iron\nabundance. In view of these results it is difficult to understand how K10 (in section 3) can come to the conclusion\nthat \"the local line profiles are sensitive to model structure\neffects to a much smaller degree than to changes of abundance or magnetic field\". It also emerges from these plots\nthat for ultra-high abundances, it becomes more or less impossible to correctly model the line core. The Atlas12 atmospheres \u2013 for good reasons \u2013 do not go further outward\nthan about log \u03c45000 = 5.0 10\u22126 and this turns out to be\nno longer sufficient for extremely strong lines. While this\nproblem hardly shows up when using a A(Fe) = 8.50 atmosphere, it becomes an object of preoccupation with the\ncorrect atmospheric models.\nThe whole problem with the adoption of a single atmospheric model for the mapping of spotted stars with large\ndifferences in abundances over the surface boils down to the\ninequality\n\n\fThe recondite intricacies of Zeeman Doppler mapping\n\n5\n\n1\n\n0\n\n-1\n\n-2\n\nFigure 3.

Both the non-magnetic\ncase (lower panel) and the magnetic case (upper panel) with field\nstrength 4400 G and 90\u25e6 angle between field vector and line-ofsight are shown. The model atmospheres are the same as presented in Fig. 2.\n\n(S1 IA1 /CA1 + S2 IA2 /CA1 ) 6=\n(S1 IA1 + S2 IA2 )/(S1 CA1 + S2 CA2 )\nwhere I stands for the line intensity, C for the continuum\nintensity. S1 and S2 are the fractions of the visible surface\ntaken by spot and remaining atmosphere respectively, A1\nand A2 are the respective abundances inside and outside\nthe spot. The left-hand side corresponds to the approximation used in all previous ZDM work, whereas the right-hand\nside gives the correct formula for the observed normalised intensity. It comes as no surprise that the consequences of not\ntaking into account the metallicity-dependent line shapes\nand absolute line intensities can be quite serious as we shall\ndemonstrate further in the following sections.\n\n5\n\nABUNDANCES AND MAGNETIC FIELD\nSTRENGTHS\n\nWhat can we learn from the plots given in the section above\nas far as the determination of abundances is concerned? Extreme Fe abundances in localised spots as claimed by K10\nfor \u03b12 CVn \u2013 there would be 3 iron atoms for every 100\nhydrogen atoms \u2013 seem a bit unrealistic but are no obstacle to modelling with Atlas12 and with Cossam. We\nhave calculated the full Stokes parameters of a spotted star\nwith v sin i = 18 km s\u22121 , inclination i = 60\u25e6 , and covered\nby a large spot of 50\u25e6 radius at 40\u25e6 latitude. For the spot\nwe adopted A(Fe) = 10.00, for the remaining part of the\nstar A(Fe) = 8.50. One set of spectra was calculated with a\n\nFigure 4. Differences between the Stokes I and V profiles of\nthe Fe ii line at 4923.927 \u00c5 of a rotating star with a single spot,\ncalculated with the correct (2) model atmospheres for the star\nand its spot on the one hand, with a mean model for star and\nspot on the other hand. The plot shows the normalised differences\nfor 5 phases (\u03c61 = 0.000, \u03c62 = 0.125, \u03c63 = 0.250, \u03c64 = 0.375,\n\u03c65 = 0.500) in the sense mean minus correct. A spot of 50\u25e6\nradius is situated at a latitude of 40\u25e6 and displays a 1.5 dex overabundance of iron with respect to the A(Fe) = 8.50 abundance\nover the rest of the star. The inclination of the star is 60\u25e6 , the\nrespective magnetic field extrema are 1500 G and 5500 G. At \u03c61\nand \u03c65 the spot is near the limb, at \u03c63 it is almost centred.\n\nA(Fe) = 8.50 atmosphere throughout, the other set is based\non the actual value, A(Fe) = 10.00, inside the spot.\nThe lower panel of Fig. 4 displays \u2013 for 5 different rotational phases \u2013 the differences between the normalised\nStokes I spectrum obtained with the same atmosphere all\nover the star (as done by K02/K10 and henceforth denoted\nas the \"usual\" spectrum) and the correct spectrum. These\ndifferences with a maximum of about 7% \u2013 which can by\nno means be considered small or negligible in view of a central line intensity of about 40% of the continuum \u2013 change\ntheir positions with phase due to the rotation. In a ZDM\ncalculation, based on the \"usual\" global atmospheric model,\nthis would translate to appropriately placed spurious overabundances, a problem which we shall discuss later in more\ndetail.\nThe upper panel of Fig. 4 reveals that polarisation is\naffected too. The tilted and eccentric dipole model adopted\nleads to respective minimum and maximum field strengths\nof 1500 and 5500 Gauss. The amount by which Stokes V can\nbe in error reaches some 2% which has to be put in relation\nto the maximum signal of about 10%. Again, the differences\nchange position with phase and simulate spurious magnetic\nfield structure.\n\n\f6\n\nM.J. Stift, F. Leone and C.R. Cowley\n\nFigure 5. Surface abundance distributions and corresponding\nH\u03b2 profiles at 4 different rotational phases of a star with a complex spot structure and 6 different iron abundances A(Fe), viz.\n7.50 (magenta), 8.00 (blue), 8.50 (sky-blue), 9.00 (green), 9.50\n(red), and 10.00 (peach). The star is seen equator-on. The full\nlines pertain to the normalised Stokes I profiles calculated at the\nphases indicated with the correct atmospheres corresponding to\nthe adopted abundances, the dotted lines are based on the \"usual\"\nA(Fe) = 8.50 atmosphere and remain constant.\n\n6\n\nTHE H\u03b2 LINE\n\nThe profile of the H\u03b2 line, together with the profiles of other\nBalmer lines, are used for the determination of the effective\ntemperature and the surface gravity of a star. If, as shown\nabove, the shapes of iron lines change with the metallicity of\nthe stellar atmosphere, what will happen to the Balmer lines\nin a spotted star and to the stellar parameters derived from\nthem? We have tried to figure this out at least partially\nby calculating phase-dependent spectra for a star with 8\nabundance regions representing 6 different iron abundances.\nThe results are shown for 4 phases in Fig. 5, together with\nthe corresponding abundance distributions over the visible\nstellar hemisphere. The dotted curves correspond to the H\u03b2\nline derived with the \"usual\" A(Fe) = 8.50 atmosphere \u2013 it\nmust remain constant irrespective of phase since we do not\nconsider Zeeman splitting of hydrogen lines \u2013 the full lines\nare based on the 6 correct model atmospheres.\nIt is immediately clear that the H\u03b2 line does not remain unaffected by high-metallicity spots, in accord with\nthe findings of Leone & Manfr\u00e9 (1997). In the particular\ncase presented here, the core is deeper by up to 5% of the\ncontinuum and the inner wings larger, something that may\npossibly have repercussions on the determination of stellar\nparameters. The outer wings turn out to change by less than\n1% at wavelengths more than 10 \u00c5 distant from the line centre. It remains to be seen if these profile changes are related\nto the core-wing anomaly discussed by Cowley et al. (2001).\n\nFigure 6.

Units are % of the continuum or %\npolarisation. The panels to the right display profiles relative to\nthose of a star with no field enhancement in the spot, convolved\nto the resolution of the K10 spectra. Note the difference in scale!\n\n7\n\nTHE DETECTABILITY OF MAGNETIC\nFINE STRUCTURE\n\nKochukhov & Wade (2010) claim to have found \"highcontrast surface distributions\" of Fe and Cr together with\n\"small-scale magnetic structures\" and a global field dominated by \"high-contrast magnetic spots\". Looking at their\nfigure 6 we indeed see \"the high-contrast structure of the\nfield strength at smaller spatial scales\" consisting in particular of 2 very intense magnetic spots of surprisingly small\nextension; at the same time their figure 9 does not reveal any\nsimilar small-scale structure in the abundance distributions\nof Fe or Cr. The magnetic spots exhibit diameters which lie\nin the approximate range of 15 \u2212 25\u25e6 , lines of constant field\nstrength are separated by as little as 8\u25e6 (for a difference of\n0.5 kG), and lines of constant abundances by about 6\u25e6 (for\na difference of 0.5 dex in abundances).\nBefore embarking on the numerical modelling of the signal of a high-contrast magnetic spot, let us shortly dwell on\njust 2 appropriate observational considerations. Looking at\nfigure 7 in K10, it appears that a feature as small as 20\u25e6 is\nresolved which in terms of spherical harmonics would corre-\n\n\fThe recondite intricacies of Zeeman Doppler mapping\nspond to m = 18. However, at the same time figure 12 in K10\ngoes no further than l = m = 10 with hardly any power left\nin this moderately high harmonic. This raises first doubts as\nto the actual detectability of small-scale structures, doubts\nwhich are not dispelled when rotational Doppler shifts are\nrelated to the resolution of the MUSICOS spectrograph on\nthe Pic-du-Midi used by K10. The rather moderate resolution of the spectra, viz. R = 35000, translates to 0.14 \u00c5\nFWHM for the iron lines used by K10. If one takes a spot of\n20\u25e6 diameter whose leading edge is exactly on the limb and\nthe trailing edge thus 70\u25e6 from the line of sight, in terms of\nDoppler shift the difference in wavelength between leading\nand trailing edge is a mere 0.018 \u00c5, corresponding to 1/8 of\nthe resolution of the spectrograph.\n7.1\n\nThe signal of a high-contrast magnetic spot\n\nThere can thus be hardly any doubt that the signal of a\nsmall-scale magnetic spot \u2013 even when the contrast to the\nsurroundings is high \u2013 will be exceedingly faint and washed\nout due to the limited resolution of the spectrograph. The\nquestion immediately arises whether such hypothetical spots\nare observable at all - remember that they tend to appear\nand to disappear with the regularisation parameter - given\nthat any error in the assumed atmospheric model translates\nto erroneous synthetic Stokes profiles on which abundance\nand magnetic field estimates are based.\nWe have for simplicity's sake assumed a centred dipole\noblique rotator model with 90\u25e6 obliquity, seen equator-on,\na polar field strength of 4.0 kG, and a spot of 20\u25e6 diameter\n(indeed a small-scale structure) at 10\u25e6 latitude. Based on\nthis geometry, we then established 2 phase-dependent sets\nof Stokes spectra with an iron abundance of A(Fe) = 10.00\nin the spot, and with A(Fe) = 8.50 over the rest of the\nstellar surface. One set uses, in the \"usual\" way, the same\natmospheric model outside and inside the spot, with the\nglobal field strength distribution given by the oblique rotator model, but multiplied by 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0 respectively\ninside the spot. For the second set we adopted the correct\napproach, using the appropriate atmospheric models corresponding to the assumed abundances, i.e. a A(Fe) = 10.00\nAtlas12 model for the spot, and again calculated models\nwith a 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0-fold enhancement of the magnetic\nfield inside the spot.\nIn the right-hand side panels of Fig. 6, we display differential Stokes I and Q profiles at phase 0.15, differential\nStokes V profiles at phase 0.25 (at these phases the respective signals due to the spot are largest), all of them with\na spectral resolution of R = 35000. The differential signal\nin Stokes U is much weaker for the adopted geometry than\nin Q or V , and therefore not plotted. The differences are\ngiven in the sense field enhanced spot minus normal field\nspot. The full lines pertain to the \"usual\" model, the dashdotted lines to the correct model, for an enhancement of 50%\n(green, sky-blue) and 100% (peach, red). Zeeman Doppler\nmapping addicts will find the maximum differential signal in\nStokes Q from a spot in which the magnetic field is increased\nfrom 2 kG to 3 kG disappointingly low, viz. a mere 0.10% for\nthe correct model, barely 0.07% for the \"usual\" model. The\nsituation is almost identical in Stokes V . Even a staggering\nfield increase in the spot from 2 kG to 4 kG is reflected in\nno more than a 0.22% differential signal in Stokes Q and V ,\n\n7\n\n0.15% for the \"usual\" model. Note that these differential\nsignals are not only disturbingly small but that figure 5 of\nK10 shows quite a few Q, U and V profiles which are not\nfitted to that accuracy!\nEven at almost infinite resolution \u2013 left side panels\nof Fig. 6 \u2013 a 50% increase in field strength in the highabundance spot adds at most 0.22% to the Stokes Q signal,\nand 0.18% to the V signal, taking the correct 2 atmospheric\nmodels. Here we have plotted the Stokes profiles relative\nto a reference spectrum calculated for a homogeneous iron\nabundance of A(Fe) = 8.50 over the entire star, in order\nto reveal the following profoundly worrisome fact: adopting the \"usual\" approach to the modelling of spotted stars\nleads to errors in all 4 Stokes parameters. This is particularly well visible in Stokes I, resulting in spurious abundance\nestimates, but Stokes Q and V too turn out to be seriously\naffected, giving magnetic field estimates in error by more\nthan 30%! Looking for example just at the Stokes V signal,\nthe \"usual\" curve for a 4 kG field inside the spot is almost\nindistinguishable from the correct curve for a 3 kG field. Put\nit the other way round, one would considerably overestimate\nboth magnetic field strength and abundance in the spot using the \"usual\" incorrect mean model approach.\nOur results clearly demonstrate that one cannot beat\nthe limited resolution of a spectrograph by using Stokes Q\nand U profiles in order to obtain magnetic maps at ultrahigh resolution It also becomes obvious that any reliable\nabundance and/or magnetic field estimates depend on the\nuse of the correct atmospheric models for the spotted stellar surface. When these prerequisites of sufficient resolution and appropriate atmospheric models are not met, how\nthen can one credibly establish secondary maxima or exceedingly small minima, in particular in places where the\nmagnetic field strength drops from about 1 kG to a few hundred Gauss?\n\n8\n\nMAPPING A SPOTTED STAR\n\nThe observed Stokes I profile of a rotating star is given by\nthe integral over the properly Doppler-shifted local line and\ncontinuum intensities. A spot with enhanced abundances\nnormally shows up as a bump, a dip, or an asymmetry of the\nprofile that varies with rotational phase. In Doppler mapping this intensity information as a function of wavelength\nis used for the reconstruction of the surface abundance distribution, translating each wavelength difference (relative to\nthe line centre) to a velocity swath on the stellar disk. As it\nturns out, this inversion is highly vulnerable to errors in the\nassumed atmospheric model.\nTo illustrate this point, we consider the profile differences presented in Fig. 4. The largest deviation in Stokes I\nis found near 4923.78 \u00c5, about 9 km s\u22121 from the unshifted\nline position. This means that halfway from the disk centre to the limb, we get an estimate of the intensity which is\nincorrect by about 15% when using the \"usual\" model. In\nStokes V the errors can become even larger, up to 30% for\nthe dash-dotted red curve near 4923.65 \u00c5. Of course such\ndifferences cannot be converted directly to abundance or\nfield corrections in some region of the stellar surface because\nDoppler mapping involves global optimisation involving a\nregularisation function. Quite some time ago, Stift (1996)\n\n\f8\n\nM.J. Stift, F. Leone and C.R. Cowley\n\nFigure 7. Iron abundance pattern (lower panel) and absolute\nfield strength (upper panel) adopted for the modelling of phasedependent Stokes spectra of a spotted star used in subsequent\nZDM discussed in section 8.\n\nhas pointed out that \"spurious abundances ... constitute the\nsometimes entirely unphysical response of a particular regularisation function to the spectral signature of the magnetic\nfield\" but it is clear that the same holds true for errors in\nthe atmospheric structure of a spotted star.\nLet us demonstrate the validity of our argument with\nactual Doppler maps. Using the revived and refined Doppler\nmapping code of Stift (1996), we have inverted a series of\nStokes I profiles corresponding in resolution, wavelength\ncoverage and number of phases to the profiles used by\nK10. The star is inclined by 65\u25e6 and covered by 3 spots\nas shown in Fig. 7; it rotates at v sin i = 18 km s\u22121 , and\nthe absolute strength of the dipolar magnetic field ranges\nfrom 2 kG to 4 kG. Inside the spots the abundance can\nbe as high as A(Fe) = 9.00, outside it is A(Fe) = 7.50.\nThe \"usual\" intensity profiles have been calculated with a\nA(Fe) = 8.00 atmosphere, the correct profiles with the appropriate A(Fe) = 7.50, 8.00, 8.50 and 9.00 atmospheres.\nThe inversion of a single line as in Kochukhov et al.\n(2004) leads to the results shown in Fig. 8. The lower panel\nshows an equal-area Hammer projection of the map obtained\nwith the \"usual\" profiles and the \"usual\" Doppler mapping\napproach, viz. under the assumption of a mean atmosphere\ninside and outside the spot, in this case a A(Fe) = 8.00 atmosphere. In the upper panel we have inverted the correct\nprofiles in exactly the same \"usual\" way. Both inversions result in a comparable quality of the fit to the input profiles,\nboth inversions display respective abundance maps that do\nnot look unreasonable at all. It is obvious that the top part\n\nFigure 8.

Synthetic profiles taken for input have been calculated for a star\ncovered by 3 spots as shown in Fig. 7; the iron abundance is up to\nA(Fe) = 9.00 in the spots and A(Fe) = 7.50 in the remaining atmosphere. One set of profiles is based on the correct atmospheric\nmodels, the other set on the \"usual\" approach with a mean model\nof A(Fe) = 8.00. The latter is employed in both inversions which\nlead to the maps shown in the respective lower (\"usual\" profiles)\nand upper (correct profiles) panels.\n\nof Fig. 8 does not resemble the bottom part of Fig. 7, but we\nwon't dwell here on the problem of finding the true extensions of spots, their contrast and number (for this see e.g.\nKhokhlova 1976, Goncharskii et al. 1982). We rather want to\nconcentrate on pointing out the mapping errors introduced\nby the differences between the metallicity assumed for the\n\"usual\" inversion and the actual metallicities in the spotted\nstar. Note the conspicuously different respective extensions\nof the main spot and the spurious structure showing up in\nseveral places.\nTo make it clear how serious the problem facing Doppler\nmapping really is, we plot the difference between the map\nobtained with the correct profiles and the \"usual\" map.\nAs revealed in Fig. 8, the differences between the respective\nabundances go from -0.5 dex to almost +0.7 dex, a remarkably large range given the relatively small error in the assumed abundance of the stellar atmosphere over most of the\nstellar surface. Note the spurious gradients near the borders\nof the actual strong spot.\n\n9\n\nCONCLUSIONS AND OUTLOOK\n\nIt is not easy to assess which of our findings will have the\nmost sobering effect on (Zeeman) Doppler mapping enthusiasts keen on claiming to have found small-scale and high-\n\n\fThe recondite intricacies of Zeeman Doppler mapping\n\nFigure 9.

This singularly strong statement is justified by the following considerations: the far-reaching claims by K10 are not based on tolerable approximations to the atmospheric structure of spotted\nstars since K10 not only neglect well-established physics of\nstellar atmospheres explored decades ago by Chandrasekhar\n(1935), but they also discard among others recent wellfounded findings and recommendations made by Khan &\nShulyak (2007). There can be no doubt that complex Zeeman Doppler maps with high-contrast abundance distributions and small-scale magnetic features can by no means be\ncorrect when local Stokes I profiles are in error by as much\nas 10% of the continuum and when field estimates based on\nlocal Stokes Q and V profiles are in error by 30% and more.\nThe fate of the K10 paper is shared by a number of similar\nanalyses (see e.g. L\u00fcftinger et al. 2010). Having been made\nto believe that full Stokes profiles provide sufficient information not only to map 2-D abundance and magnetic field distributions but also 3-D abundance stratifications (L\u00fcftinger\net al. 2008, but see Stift & Alecian 2009) we were rather surprised to see that excellent ZDM codes like Invers10 used\nby K10 can yield good fits to the observed Stokes IQU V\nprofiles even when the adopted local line profiles are grossly\nin error. The results shown in Fig. 8 were equally surprising since they reveal that the adoption of an atmospheric\nmodel of mean metallicity in the Doppler mapping procedure \u2013 the respective correct models for the star and its\nspots differ by at most \u00b11.00 dex from this mean model \u2013\nleads to local abundance discrepancies of between \u22120.50 dex\nand +0.70 dex. Considering the fact that at A(Fe) = 8.00\nmetallicity effects are still relatively small and that they increase drastically for A(Fe) > 9.50 (see Fig. 1 and Fig. 2), we\nare not overly optimistic as e.g. to the reliability of the iron\ndistribution derived by K10, where the adopted atmosphere\n\n9\n\nwith A(Fe) = 8.50 differs from the \"local\" atmospheres by\nas much as 2 dex.\nLet us also dwell a bit on a previously unnoticed, but\nnot altogether surprising, complication that must be taken\ninto account when applying ZDM. The adoption of a mean\natmosphere for a spotted star will not only lead to erroneous\nsurface abundance patterns but also to incorrect magnetic\ngeometries. In fact, it turns out that the Stokes Q, U and\nV profiles suffer considerably from metallicity related effects; the adoption of a mean atmosphere for a spotted star\ncan induce spurious changes of about 30% and more in the\nmaximum polarisation signal. These wavelength- and phasedependent profile changes will necessarily translate to errors\nin the distribution of magnetic field strength and direction.\nGiven all the systematic errors in the 4 Stokes parameters\nwhich result from the use of a mean atmosphere, it could\nthen prove premature to combine abundance and magnetic\nmaps in an effort to verify how these data match theoretical\npredictions from the diffusion model (Michaud 1970) or to\ncorrelate the radial field field and abundance distributions\nof various elements as done by K02.\nEven less surprisingly, it is shown that the existence\nof \"small-scale magnetic structures\" and of \"high-contrast\nmagnetic spots\" cannot at present be ascertained at any\nacceptable level of confidence. Even apparently moderate\nerrors in the assumed atmosphere model can lead to nonnegligible errors in the inferred magnetic field of a small,\nhigh-contrast spot. Any reliable detection of such a magnetic\nspot would only be possible with a much higher spectral\nresolution than available to K02 or K10, and it would require\na fit to the Stokes Q, U , and V profiles to at least 0.1\u22120.2%.\nOne should therefore consider magnetic fine structure as for\nexample shown in figure 7 of K10 to be largely an artefact\nof regularisation.\nIn view of our results, the outlook for ZDM is a bit bleak\nbut not hopeless. Success in the quest for more reliable maps\nof CP stars depends on the ability to eschew the use of a\nmean atmosphere, replacing it with a whole grid of stellar\natmospheres with different abundances of all the elements\nimportant enough to influence the temperature structure of\nthe atmosphere (see again Khan & Shulyak 2007). As experience with CossamSpot shows this might put serious\nstrain on computing resources but there is no way around\nit. In return, abundance maps based on the correct atmosphere models might exhibit less spectacular amplitudes and\nthe contrast might diminish, reducing the complexity of the\ncomputations. It is clear that ZDM is still in its infancy\nbut multi-core computer architectures in combination with\nmodern object-oriented programming paradigms and powerful compilers will make it possible to enter the next phase.\nKeep however in mind that this approach is still full of (it is\nhoped) acceptable approximations and that more difficulties\nare lurking behind the bend: the influence of magnetic fields\non the atmospheric structure, stratification, 2D and 3D stellar atmospheres for latitude- and longitude-dependent stratifications, etc.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThanks go to AdaCore for providing the GNAT GPL Edition of its Ada2005 compiler.\n\n\f10\n\nM.J.
