Unlike previous attempts,\nwe use noise scaling and a thermal state to obtain an\nabsolute quanti\u001ccation of the measurement noise. The\nresults are con\u001crmed by independent quanti\u001ccation of\nthe QND measurement gain, i.e., the atom-light interaction strength. The new method detects di\u001berent noise\nsources, i.e., atomic and light quantum and technical\nnoise, and the electronic noise \u001door, by their respective\nscaling with atom and photon number. The results indicate that it will be possible to increase the sensitivity of\nmagnetometers with MHz-bandwidth by applying measurement induced squeezing. This can have important\n\n[17]\n[18]\n[19]\n[20]\n[21]\n[22]\n\nimplications for spatially resolved magnetometry, where\ncold atomic systems have demonstrated\n\n\u03bcm-resolution\n\n[23]\n\n[23]. Also in the \u001celd of quantum information processing, projection-noise limited QND measurements play\nan essential role for quantum memory and quantum\ncloning tasks [24].\nWe thank Robert Sewell for careful reading of the\n\n[24]\n\nElectronic address:\nmarco.koschorreck@icfo.es;\nURL: http://icfo.es\nD.
