The latter has the following relevant effects on the galaxy: (i) the evolution of\ngas content, (ii) the chemical enrichment and (iii) the formation of the stellar populations\nwith different properties as the gas from which they form evolves. The star formation\nhistory is therefore fundamental to understand the galaxy evolution process.\nThe color-magnitude diagram (CMD) is the best tool to study and derive the star\nformation history (SFH) of a galaxy. Deep CMDs display stars born all over the life-time\nof the galaxy and are indeed fossil records of the SFH. A qualitative sketch of the stellar\npopulations present in a galaxy can be done from a quick look to a good CMD. The presence\nof stars in characteristic evolutionary phases indicates that star formation took place in\nthe system in different epochs of its history. For example, the presence of RR-Lyre stars is\nindicative of an old, low metallicity stellar population; a substantial amount of red-giant\nbranch (RGB) stars is associated to an intermediate-age to old star formation activity; a\nwell developed red-tail of asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars shows that intermediate-age\nand young stars with relatively high metallicity are present in the system, and even a\nfew blue, bright stars as well as HII regions are evidences of a very recent star formation\nactivity.\nA higher degree of sophistication is provided by isochrone fitting to significant features\nof the CMD. Indeed, this method is simple and powerful enough to determine age and\nmetallicity of single stellar populations as the ones present in star clusters.\nHowever, actually deciphering the information contained in a complex CMD and\nderiving a quantitative, accurate SFH is complicated and requires more sophisticated\ntechniques. The standard procedure involves three main ingredients: (i) good data, from\nwhich a deep, ideally reaching the oldest main-sequence turn-offs, observational CMD can\nbe plotted; (ii) a stellar evolution library complemented by a bolometric correction library\nproviding colors and magnitudes of stars as a function of age, mass and metallicity, and\n(iii) a method to relate the number of stars populating different regions of the observational\nCMD with the density distribution of stars in the CMD as a function of age, mass and\nmetallicity as predicted by the stellar evolution theory. The result of this comparison\nprovides the SFH of the system.\nUsually, item (iii) involves computation of one or several synthetic CMDs from which\nthe star density distribution predicted from theory is deduced. Indeed, the synthetic CMD\ntechnique is the most powerful one available for this kind of analysis and, in general, for the\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\nstudy of the SFH of resolved stellar populations. The first to compute and use a synthetic\nCMD using a monte-carlo technique was Maeder (1974). Chiosi, Bertelli, & Bressan (1988)\npresented the first application of the Padua synthetic CMD code. Tosi et al. (1991) used,\nfor the first time, luminosity functions derived from synthetic CMDs to sketch recent SFHs\nof nearby galaxies. Bertelli et al. (1992) were the first to use the global detailed morphology\ntogether with number counts and ratios of star counts in different areas of the synthetic\nand observed CMDs to derive the SFH of a galaxy (the LMC).\nA more recent version of the Padua code is ZVAR, which distinctive feature is the age\nand metallicity interpolation that is performed for each single star in the Padua grid of\nstellar evolution tracks. This has been a heavily used code in the recent past (e.g., Gallart\net al. 1996; Vallenari et al. 1996a,b; Aparicio, Gallart, & Bertelli 1997a,b; Hurley-Keller,\nMateo, & Nemec 1998; Gallart et al. 1999; Aparicio, Tikhonov, & Karachentsev 2000;\nVallenari, Bertelli & Schmidtobreick 2000; Bertelli & Nasi 2001; Ng et al. 2002; Bertelli et\nal. 2003; see Aparicio et al. 1996 for several examples of synthetic CMDs using ZVAR and\nAparicio 2003, for a review). Other codes have been developed by different groups for the\ncomputation of synthetic CMDs (see Tolstoy & Saha 1996; Dolphin 1997; Holtzman et al.\n1999; Ardeberg et al. 1997; Stappers et al. 1997; Dohm-Palmer et al. 1997; Hern\u00e1ndez,\nValls-Gabaud, & Gilmore 1999; Harris & Zaritsky 2001).\nIn this paper we present a new algorithm for the computation of synthetic CMDs.\nIt is intended to be as general as possible. For this purpose, a variety of inputs for the\ninitial mass function (IMF), SFH, metallicity law and binariety are allowed. Stars with\nage and metallicity following a continuous distribution are computed through interpolation\nin a stellar evolution library, providing synthetic CMDs with smooth, realistic stellar\ndistributions. This significantly improves the accuracy of the comparison with observed\nCMDs as compared to with methods without such interpolation. The Padua stellar\nevolution libraries by Bertelli et al. (1994; Bertelli94 from here on) and Girardi et al. (2000;\nGirardi00; from here on) and Teramo (Pietrinferni et al. 2004) stellar evolution library are\nused in the current version of the program, completed by the Cassisi et al. (2000) models\nfor very low mass stars. Together with the luminosity and temperature of each star, the\ncode provides the absolute magnitudes in Johnson-Cousins UBV RI, HST F 218W , F 336W ,\nF 439W m F 450W , F 555W and F 814 and infrared JHKLL\u2032 M filters. To this purpose the\nbolometric correction libraries by Lejeune, Cuisinier, & Buser (1997), Castelli & Kurukz\n(2002), Girardi et al. (2002) and Origlia & Leitherer (2000) are used, the later for the HST\nfilter system. In summary, in the current version of the code, the user can select among\nthree stellar evolution libraries and four bolometric correction libraries. The code includes\nthe thermally pulsating AGB (TP-AGB) following the prescription of Marigo, Bressan, &\nChiosi (1996).\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\nThe code is made available for free use. It can be executed at the internet site\nhttp://iac-star.iac.es with the only requirement of crediting as mentioned in that\npage. The present paper should be considered as the reference for the code. This paper will\nbe complemented by several others presenting, in particular, a method based on a genetic\nalgorithm to compute the SFH from comparison of an observed and a generic synthetic\nCMD (Aparicio & Hidalgo 2004) and a library of population synthesis based in surface\nbrightness fluctuations (Mar\u0131\u0301n-Franch & Aparicio 2004).\nThis paper is organized as follows. In \u00a72, the fundamentals of synthetic CMD\ncomputation are given, including short descriptions of the stellar evolution and bolometric\ncorrection libraries used. In \u00a73, \u00a74 and \u00a75, the basic stellar evolution, the main features\narising in a real CMD and the main aspects of chemical enrichment laws are summarized.\nThese topics are relevant for a better understanding of the computation process and the\nsynthetic results. Section 6 is devoted to explain how the code works as well as some\nparticularities including the computation of mass loss in advanced evolutionary phases.\nSection 7 is a short outline of the code input and output. A full commented list of input\nchoices and a description of the output file content are available in the internet site from\nwhich the program is run (http://iac-star.iac.es). This will be permanently updated,\nincluding any future change in the input and output. Finally, a summary of the paper is\ngiven in \u00a78.\n\n2.\n\nFundamentals of synthetic CMD\n\nThe distribution of stars in a CMD depends on several aspects on the physics of stars\nand galaxies. Broadly speaking, the density of stars in a given region of the CMD is\ndirectly proportional to the time that stars of any mass and metallicity spend in that region\nduring their evolution. This information is provided primarily by stellar evolution theory,\non which the computation of synthetic CMDs strongly relies, complemented by bolometric\ncorrections. But, since the fraction of stars formed with different masses vary with mass, the\ndistribution of the stellar masses at birth, the so called IMF, provides a second, important\ninput characterizing the star density distribution on the CMD. Stars, on the other hand,\nare not formed at the same rate during the life-time of a galaxy. The function accounting\nfor the star formation rate (SFR) as a function of time is a further important input. Besides\nthis, stars are born with the metallicity of the interstellar medium from which they form.\nSo, the chemical enrichment law (CEL) of the system holding them is another fundamental\ninformation. The last important contribution to the morphology of the CMD comes from\nthe fraction and mass ratio distribution of binary stars. Other physical properties do affect\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\nthat morphology, like the internal, differential reddening or the mass distribution (stellar\npopulation gradients, depth effects, etc) within the system. However, these are properties\nthat can be considered as external to the CMD itself. In most (or all) cases in which we are\ninterested, they can be added later on to the computed synthetic CMD.\nIn summary, the inputs necessary to compute a synthetic CMD are the following:\n\u2022 A stellar evolution library, covering a wide range of stellar evolutionary phases and\nstellar masses and metallicities. It should provide stellar luminosities, temperatures\nand surface gravities as a function of mass, metallicity and age.\n\u2022 A bolometric correction library to transform from stellar luminosities, temperatures\nand surface gravities to magnitudes in a given photometric system.\n\u2022 An IMF, \u03c6(m).\n\u2022 A SFR function, \u03c8(t).\n\u2022 A CEL, Z(t).\n\u2022 A function accounting for the fraction, and secondary to primary mass ratio\ndistribution, of binary stars, \u03b2(f, q).\nIn the following we will shortly comment on the stellar evolution and bolometric\ncorrection libraries used here and on the computation algorithm.\n\n2.1.\n\nThe stellar evolution libraries\n\nComputation of a synthetic CMD relies on a stellar evolutionary library, which should\nbe computed using the most up-to-date physics, well tested against observations, and\ncomplete in terms of ages, metallicities and evolutionary phases. These three characteristics\nare hard to be accomplished and, indeed, many of the accuracy and precision limitations\nof synthetic CMD based techniques originate in this. In its current version, IAC-star uses\nthe Bertelli94, Girardi00 and Teramo (Pietrinferni et al. 2004) stellar evolution libraries,\ncompleted by the Cassisi et al. (2000) models for very low mass stars. Even though the\nBertelli94 library has been basically superseded by the Girardi00 one, we have chosen to\ninclude both libraries since many SFH studies in the past have been performed using the\nBertelli94 one which may be chosen for comparative studies. It is our intention to include\nadditional libraries in the future. In Table 1 the characteristics and main input physics of\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\nthe three libraries are listed. Figure 1 shows several tracks from the Bertelli94 library as\nwell as two very low mass star models computed from Cassisi et al. (2000).\n\n2.2.\n\nThe bolometric correction libraries\n\nComparison of synthetic and observed CMDs require transforming the first from the\ntheoretical plane (the Teff \u2212 L plane) to the observational one (the color-magnitude plane).\nThis is done by adopting a bolometric correction scale and a color - effective temperature\nrelation. It is important to note that, while the stellar evolution library is fundamental\nfor the computation of the synthetic CMD itself, an equally reliable bolometric correction\nlibrary is required if synthetic CMDs are to be compared with observed ones. This also\nimplies that the derivation of accurate SFHs relies on the accuracy of both stellar evolution\nlibrary and the model atmospheres set adopted for computing the bolometric correction\nscale and color - Teff relation.\nIn its current version, IAC-star implements four choices for the bolometric correction\nand color - Teff relation libraries:\n\u2022 The Girardi et al. (2002) library providing bolometric corrections for visual, broad\nband UBV RI and infrared JHK filters.\n\u2022 The Castelli & Kurucz (2002) library for visual, broad band UBV RI and infrared\nJHKL filters, completed with the Flucks et al. (1994) semi-empirical transformations\nfor M giants. Care has been taken that the two sets properly match.\n\u2022 The Lejeune, Cuisinier, & Buser (1997) library for visual, broad band UBV RI filters\nand infrared JHKLL\u2032 M filters.\n\u2022 The Origlia & Leitherer (2000) library for F 218W , F 336W , F 439W , F 450W , F 555W\nand F 814W filters of the HST WFPC2 and ACS.\nThese libraries fulfill the requirements of completeness and wide metallicity ([F e/H]),\ntemperature (Teff ) and gravity (g) coverage and sampling, as well as having been empirically\ncalibrated. It is our intention to include other libraries, as well as transformations for\nadditional photometric bands such as the Stromgren ones, in the future as they become\navailable.\nThe bolometric correction and the color - Teff are functions of the following three\nparameters: BC([F e/H], Teff , g). The used libraries allow obtaining bolometric corrections\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\nfor almost all cases, although they fail to fully cover a few, very low temperature cases.\nLinear extrapolation is used in such cases. Since it is necessary in very few cases, the\ndeviation effects that could arise in the CMD from that extrapolation should be negligible.\nHowever, detailed analysis of color distribution of stars in phases as the extended AGB\nshould be made with caution.\n\n2.3.\n\nComputing a synthetic CMD\n\nIAC-star uses a monte-carlo method to compute synthetic CMDs on a star by star\nbasis. A random number generator (RNG) is used to compute, first the mass, and then the\ntime of birth of the star, according to the distribution functions \u03c6(m) and \u03c8(t), respectively.\nThe value of time is introduced in the function Z(t) to obtain the metallicity. If metallicity\ndispersion is allowed, its exact value is obtained using such a dispersion and a new random\nnumber. The binariety of the star is determined in a similar way, using a RNG and the\nfunction \u03b2(f, q), in which f is the fraction of binaries and q the internal mass rate. If the\nstar turns out to be a binary, it is assumed to be the primary (most massive) star of the\nsystem. The age and metallicity of the secondary are assumed to be the same as for the\nprimary. The mass of the secondary is computed using again the RNG and according to\nthe secondary to primary mass ratio distribution provided by q and an assumed IMF for\nthe secondaries. The lifetime of each star, according to the stellar evolution models, is\nused at this point to decide whether the star is alive (and to calculate then its remaining\nparameters), or dead (and to calculate the properties of the remnant). The case in which\nonly the secondary star is alive is allowed.\nOnce the mass, age and metallicity are known, luminosity, temperature and\nsurface gravity of the star are computed through interpolation within the chosen stellar\nevolutionary library. If the star is a binary, the process is repeated for each component.\nFinally, luminosity, temperature and gravity are interpolated in the chosen bolometric\ncorrection library to obtain magnitudes and colors in the standard photometric system.\nThese are the computation fundamentals. In \u00a77, we provide details about the procedure\nitself. But before, it is clarifying to outline the aspects of the stellar evolution relevant to\nthe morphology of the CMD (\u00a73); to review such morphology (\u00a74), and to discuss the CEL,\nits parameterization and its relation to basic physical properties of the system (\u00a75).\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\n3.\n\nBasic stellar evolution\n\nLuminosity, L, and temperature Teff , as a function of stellar age and metallicity,\nas well as lifetime, are, for our purposes, the main information provided by the stellar\nevolutionary library. If s is a star of mass ms , metallicity Zs and age as , a first estimate\nof its location in the CMD might be obtained just by time interpolation within a single\nevolutionary track of age and metallicity closest to the stellar values. However, if a realistic\nsynthetic CMD is to be computed, interpolation must be done between tracks both in age\nand metallicity. The fact that stars experience different particular physical processes along\ntheir evolution that, like the He-flash, abruptly interrupt their smooth evolutionary paths,\nmakes this interpolation rather cumbersome. In the following, we will sketch the basic\nstellar evolution directly affecting the synthetic CMD computation problem. In this sense,\nit is useful to divide stars in three groups according to their masses: low, intermediate and\nhigh mass stars (see Chiosi et al. 1992 and Chiosi 1998 for a short but clear summary of\nthe basic stellar evolution). The critical masses separating these groups depend on the\nchemical composition and the input physics. But, roughly, the mass separating the low and\nintermediate dominions, mlw , is in the range 1.7 \u2212 2.0 M\u2299 and the mass separating the\nintermediate and high dominions, mup , is in the range 5 \u2212 7 M\u2299 . In Fig. 2 the loci of the\ndifferent features that will be introduced in the following are displayed.\nStars of any mass spend a major fraction of their lives in the core H-burning, main\nsequence (MS) phase. As H is exhausted in the core, the star leaves the MS while the\nH-burning proceeds in a shell. At this point, a star may follow two types of paths in the\nCMD, depending on its mass. In low mass stars, the H-exhausted, He core is not massive,\nhot and dense enough to immediately start the He-burning. The core gravitationally\ncontracts and, as a consequence, degeneracy appears in the electronic gas. This degeneracy\nstops the core collapse. As H-burning proceeds in a shell, the star climbs the RGB and\nmore He is incorporated into the degenerated core. When the mass of this core reaches\nabout 0.45 to 0.50 M\u2299 (the precise mass depends on chemical composition, stellar mass\nand input physics), He-burning starts violently, removing the electron degeneracy. This\nis the so called He-flash. The star abruptly terminates the RGB phase and start the\nhorizontal-branch, in which He-burning and H-burning proceed in the core and a shell,\nrespectively. Since the He-flash is produced at essentially identical core mass, the maximum\nRGB luminosity is almost constant, independently of the stellar metallicity and initial\nmass. The same happens to the luminosity of the horizontal branch (HB). However, the\nstellar surface effective temperature, which determines the position of the star in the HB,\nstrongly depends on several factors, among which the most important are the chemical\ncomposition and total stellar mass. It must be noted that the latter depends not only on\nthe initial stellar mass, but also on the mass loss during the RGB and the He-flash.\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\nIn intermediate and high mass stars, the He-core ignites in non-degenerate conditions\nas soon as the central temperature and density reach some threshold values, approximately\n108 K and 104 g cm\u22123 , respectively. This requires a minimum core mass of 0.33 M\u2299 .\nSince this mass depends on the initial stellar mass, the luminosity of the star during this\nphase increases with stellar mass. In intermediate mass stars (including the lower end of\nhigh mass stars), the core He-burning phase takes place in two regions of the CMD. The\nfirst one is close to the Hayashi line. Subsequently, when the energy produced in the He\ncore, which is increasing, equals the energy produced in the H shell, which is decreasing,\nthe outer envelope rapidly contracts passing from convective to radiative. Temperature\nincreases and the star migrates to a bluer region. This produces the blue-loop (BL) phase.\nIt appears rather red in Fig. 2 as corresponds to the high metallicity of the computed young\npopulation.\nBoth in low and intermediate mass stars, a C-O core is formed as a result of core\nHe-burning. Upon the exhaustion of He in the core, the mass of the C-O core is constant\nfor low mass stars, but increases with stellar mass for all the others. The structure of stars\nis hence formed by a C-O core, a He-burning shell, a H-burning shell and a H-rich envelope.\nIn low and intermediate mass stars, the mass of the C-O core is not high enough to ignite\nand an electron degenerated core again develops. The star expands, produces a convective\nenvelope and evolves upward running almost parallel to the RGB. This is the asymptotic\ngiant branch (AGB) phase. Cooling in the regions external to the C-O core extinguishes\nthe H-burning shell but, eventually, the expansion of the envelope is stopped by its own\ncooling, the envelope contracts and the H-shell re-ignites. This terminates the early-AGB\n(E-AGB). After that, the He-shell becomes thermally unstable. Both, the H and He\nshells alternate as the main sources of energy producing the TP-AGB phase. This process\nresults in efficient mass loss and terminates with the complete ejection of the envelope and\ntemporally producing a planetary nebula. The remnant is a C-O white dwarf of mass lower\nthan the Chandrasekar limit (1.4 M\u2299 ). Intermediate (and low) mass stars fail to ignite the\nC-O core.\nIn high mass stars, the C-O core ignites in non-degenerate conditions. The fraction of\nhigh mass stars formed in a galaxy is small and their life-times short. For these reasons\nthey do not affect significantly the structure of the CMD and we do not go further in the\ndiscussion of their evolution. It is enough to mention that mass loss plays a fundamental\nrole in determining the position in the CMD of core He-burning stars more massive than\nabout 15 M\u2299 , and that, after core C-O ignition, they proceed through a series of nuclear\nburnings and finish theirs lives with a supernova explosion.\n\n\f\u2013 10 \u2013\n4.\n\nMain features of the CMD\n\nThe main features and the distribution of stars produced by stellar evolution in a CMD\ncan be seen in Fig. 2, where a synthetic CMD, computed for constant SFR from 13 Gyr\nago to date, is shown. The CMD is based in the Bertelli94 stellar evolution library and the\nLejeune et al. (1997) bolometric correction library. The IMF obtained by Kroupa, Tout &\nGilmore (1993) and a simple CEL with metallicity Z(t) increasing linearly with time, initial\nvalue Z0 = 0.0001 and final value Zf = 0.02 have been used. Colors are associated to age\nintervals to illustrate the distribution of stars in the CMD according to their age. Labels\nare included to identify the MS, BL, RGB, AGB, HB and red-clump (RC) phases. The RC\nis formed by a mix of the reddest HB stars and the bottom part of the core He-burning\nphase of intermediate mass stars. The remaining features have been introduced in \u00a73.\nThe MS provides the most important and unambiguous age information. But it is\ninteresting to note that, besides it, the BL and the AGB, if well populated, provide useful\nand complementary age information, which is poor, however, on the RGB. But the latter\ngives information on the integrated star formation rate for intermediate and old stellar\npopulations and provides clues to constrain the CEL.\nThe morphology of the CMD is altered by the presence of binary stars. Figure 3\nillustrates the effect, which is most obvious in the lowest MS but affects also the overall\ndistribution of stars in the CMD.\nTo simplify the discussion of stellar populations based on CMD analysis, it is useful\nto introduce some terminology. We will use the terms old, intermediate-age and young to\nspecify three stellar age ranges which are associated to features clearly recognizable in the\nCMD. By old we will refer to populations that are not able to produce bright, extended\nAGBs. This corresponds to ages larger than about 10 Gyr. Good examples of old objects\nare globular clusters. Old populations will always produce a well populated RGB and\nadditionally, they may show a blue extended HB. However, the latter is not a unambiguous\nage indicator, since it depends on metallicity and mass loss on the RGB. Intermediate-age\npopulations are those producing an RGB as well as extended, bright AGBs. They are\nolder than 1 \u2212 2 Gyr. Finally, young populations are those igniting He in the nucleus in\nnon-degenerate conditions, and therefore failing to produce an RGB. The age separating the\nyoung from the intermediate-age ranges is the MS life time of stars of mass equal to mlw ,\nthe mass separating the low and intermediate-mass dominions. A pure young population\nwould not have had time for low-mass stars to evolve from the MS.\n\n\f\u2013 11 \u2013\n5.\n\nThe chemical enrichment law of a stellar system\n\nIn its current version, IAC-star offers two main procedures to compute the CEL, Z(t):\n(i) by linear interpolation in several, arbitrary Z(t) nodes given by the user, and (ii) from\nthe parameters (yield, infall and outflow rates, etc.) used in physical CEL scenarios. For a\nbetter understanding of the second procedure, the CEL fundamentals are outlined in this\nsection. However, it must be noted and kept in mind that IAC-star is not a code to solve for\nchemical enrichment law scenarios. It allows a wide range of choices for them and computes\nstars with the necessary coupling between age, metallicity, SFR and gas fraction provided\nby the input parameters. But it is the user responsibility to decide what kind of chemical\nlaw is to be used. On the other hand, the linear interpolation in Z(t) nodes, which includes\na linear law and a constant one, is a simplistic, perhaps physically unrealistic choice, but it\nmay work well for many users, in particular when details about the actual metallicity law\nare not known. It must be also noted that a simple, linear CEL is not far from the law of a\nmoderate infall model.\nMetallicity laws for a closed box and for infall, outflow of well mixed material and\noutflow of rich material can be found in Peimbert, Col\u0131\u0301n, & Sarmiento (1994). In IAC-star\nthe infall and outflow (of well mixed material) scenarios can be used as well as the close\nbox one, which is but a limit case of any of the former. The unmixed, rich material outflow\ncan be simulated by the well mixed material outflow if the yield is allowed to vary and we\nare not interested on the Helium to Oxygen ratio, which, in any case, is beyond the scope\nof this software.\nAssuming instantaneous recycling, infall and outflow laws are given by (Peimbert et al.\n1994)\ny\n{1 \u2212 [\u03b1 \u2212 (\u03b1 \u2212 1)\u03bc(t)\u22121]\u2212\u03b1/(1\u2212\u03b1) }\n\u03b1\ny\nZ(t) = Z0 +\nln[(\u03bb + 1)\u03bc(t)\u22121 \u2212 \u03bb]\n\u03bb+1\n\nZ(t) = Z0 +\n\n(Infall)\n(Outflow)\n\n(1)\n(2)\n\nThe chemical enrichment theory has been developed elsewhere (see Tinsley 1980;\nPeimbert et al. 1994 and references therein) and it is not our aim to discuss it here in any\ndetail. However, the former equations deserve some comments in order to understand the\nCEL computation in IAC-star. The initial metallicity, Z0 should be 0 for physically realistic\nmodels, but it will be useful to have the possibility of assuming some initial enrichment in\nsome cases. The yield, y is defined as the mass of newly formed metals that a generation\nof stars ejects to the interstellar medium, relative to the mass locked in stars and stellar\nremnants by the same stellar generation. \u03bc is the gas mass fraction relative to the total\n\n\f\u2013 12 \u2013\nmass intervening in the chemical evolution; i.e. including stars, stellar remnants, low mass\nobjects, dust and gas itself but excluding dark matter, which does not intervene in such\nprocess.\nParameters \u03b1 and \u03bb control infall and outflow respectively. They are defined as\nfI = \u03b1(1 \u2212 R)\u03c8 and fO = \u03b1(1 \u2212 R)\u03c8, where fI and fO are the infall and outflow rates,\nrespectively and R is the mass fraction returned to the interstellar medium by a generation\nof stars. In this way, (1 \u2212 R)\u03c8 is the mass locked into stars and stellar remnants and fI and\nfO are given as fractions (\u03b1 and \u03bb) of this mass. A few things must be pointed out. First,\nsince \u03c8 is a function of time, also fI and fO are so. Second, both \u03b1 and \u03bb can take values\n> 1. Finally, the simple closed box model is obtained from any of the former relations if,\nrespectively, \u03b1 = 0 or \u03bb = 0.\nThe mass fraction, \u03bc, appearing in equations 1 and 2 is coupled to the SFR or, rather,\nto its integral, by\n\u03bc(t) = 1 \u2212\n\n(1 \u2212 R)\u03a8(t)\nM0 + (1 \u2212 R)\u03a8(t)(\u03b1 \u2212 \u03bb)\n\n(3)\n\nR\n\nwhere M0 is the initial mass of the system and \u03a8(t) = 0t \u03c8(t\u2032 )dt\u2032 . This relation for \u03bc is\nvalid for equation 1 and 2 just using \u03bb = 0 in the first case and \u03b1 = 0 in the second one.\nLets assume for simplicity, and only in the context of the chemical law computation, that\nthe time unit is the present age of the system, with t = 0 for the initial instant and t = 1\nfor the present day time, and that the integral of the SFR is normalized also for the system\nR\nage ( 01 \u03c8(t\u2032 )dt\u2032 = 1). With this, the initial mass of the system can be written as\nM0 = (1 \u2212 R)(\u03bb \u2212 \u03b1 \u2212\n\n1\n)\n\u03bcf \u2212 1\n\n(4)\n\nwhere \u03bcf is the final gas fraction. The yield, which is assumed here to be constant, can also\nbe expressed as a function of Z0 and Zf (the final metallicity):\ny=\n\n(Zf \u2212 Z0 )\u03b1\n\u2212\u03b1/(1\u2212\u03b1)\n1 \u2212 [\u03b1 \u2212 (\u03b1 \u2212 1)\u03bc\u22121\nf ]\ny=\n\n(Zf \u2212 Z0 )(\u03bb + 1)\nln[(\u03bb + 1)\u03bc\u22121\nf \u2212 \u03bb]\n\n(Infall)\n(Outflow)\n\n(5)\n(6)\n\nIn practice, the most frequent situation is one in which the researcher has observational\ninformation about \u03bcf and Zf and can assume that \u03bc0 = 1 and Z0 = 0 or small. R can be\nderived from the stellar evolution models (it is R \u2243 0.2 for the Padua stellar evolution\n\n\f\u2013 13 \u2013\nmodels, although it depends slightly on the metallicity) and \u03c8(t) is the key function of the\nstellar population model (usually what is sought in the analyzed galaxy). The remaining\nparameters are \u03b1 and \u03bb, for which reasonable guesses need to be made. Of course, in this\nway y is no longer the physical stellar yield, but an effective yield defined just by equations\n5 and 6. If the physical relevance of the chemical evolution model is seeked, the consistency\nof all the parameters must be analyzed. However, for the purposes of computing a synthetic\nCMD, the chemical law is only an ingredient of the code, which can be imposed from\noutside. Users of IAC-star are encouraged to check and decide the required chemical law.\nWe insist that IAC-star only provides the coupling between \u03c8(t), \u03bc(t) and Z(t) for the set\nof input Z0 , Zf , \u03bcf and \u03b1 or \u03bb.\nIn Fig. 4 several examples of CELs for different choices of \u03bcf , \u03b1, \u03bb and \u03c8(t) are given\nfor fixed Z0 and Zf . For \u03c8(t), an exponential law of the form \u03c8(t) = A exp(\u2212t/\u03b2\u03c8 ) is used.\nIn Fig. 5 a law with metallicity dispersion is shown.\n\n6.\n\nIAC-star computation outline\n\nIn this section we will outline how the IAC-star algorithm works paying attention to the\ngeneral interpolation procedure and to how different stellar mass ranges and evolutionary\nphases are handled. Computation of mass loss in advanced evolutionary phases is explained\nin the last paragraph. In Fig. 1 several tracks of different masses from the Bertelli94 library\nare plotted as reference for the following discussion.\n\n6.1.\n\nThe general case\n\nAs discussed in \u00a72, a monte-carlo algorithm and the corresponding probability\ndistribution functions are used to provide the age, as , mass, ms , and metallicity, Zs , of each\nsynthetic star. In the general, simplest case, mass and metallicity are used to compute the\nevolutionary track of the star by bi-logarithmic interpolation within the evolutionary track\nlibrary. It is important to make this simple but important and cumbersome process clear.\nNote that one of the difficulties is that tracks are not functions, but arbitrary curves, time\nbeing the driving parameter. For this, interpolation must be done between homologous\nsections of different tracks.\nLet first introduce some notation. Tracks are identified by mass and metallicity. We\nwill name tracks by Ki,j, the first index denoting the metallicity and the second one, the\nmass. Zs represents a value of metallicity between two values present in the stellar evolution\n\n\f\u2013 14 \u2013\nlibrary. The algorithm input does not allow extrapolation outside the library limits in Z.\nlib\nlib\nLets call Zilib and Zi+1\nthese two values, respectively. So Zilib \u2264 Zs \u2264 Zi+1\n. A search is then\nlib\nlib\nmade within Zi and Zi+1 track subsets to look for the mass values embracing ms . Lets\nlib\nlib\ncall mlib\nsubset and mlib\ni,j and mi,j+1 the track mass values embracing ms for the Zi\ni+1,k and\nlib\nlib\nlib\nlib\nlib\nmi+1,k+1 the same for the Zi+1 subset. So mi,j \u2264 ms \u2264 mi,j+1 and mi+1,k \u2264 ms \u2264 mlib\ni+1,k+1 .\nThe track corresponding to star s can now be obtained by logarithmic interpolation between\ntracks Ki,j , Ki,j+1, Ki+1,k , Ki+1,k+1 . Lets call this interpolated track Ks . Additionally, lets\ncall \u03c4i,j the life time of track Ki,j , i.e., the time at which evolution within that track finish,\nand \u03c4s the corresponding life time for the interpolated track.\nOnce Ks has been obtained, the photometric parameters of the star are obtained\nstraightforwardly by logarithmic interpolation of as within this track. However, before this,\nwhether the star is death or alive must be established. This is done just comparing as with\n\u03c4s . If as \u2264 \u03c4s , logarithmic interpolation is performed and the computation is finished for\nthis star. If not, a new dichotomy arises. If the star is of intermediate or high mass, as > \u03c4s\nmeans that it is death. The mass of the remnant is then computed as explained below and\nadded to the total mass of the system. If the star is of low mass, as > \u03c4s means that it is\nbeyond the He-flash. Computation in the HB track subset must be performed in this case.\nFor this, the mass loss of the star during the RGB is subtracted from ms (see below) and\n\u03c4s is subtracted from as . The resulting mass and age, ms,HB and as,HB , are used in the HB\ntrack subset. Computation is similar to that in the general library. If as,HB is larger than\nthe life time of the new interpolated HB track, the star is considered death and the remnant\nmass is computed and stored as before.\nWe have outlined the general computation. However, a few special cases can occur\nthat need more comments. We will treat them in the following.\n\n6.2.\n\nInterpolation and extrapolation between different mass ranges\n\nIt may occur that the tracks embracing the mass and metallicity of the synthetic star\nbelong to two different mass ranges (see Fig. 1). If some tracks are in the high mass range\nand some in the intermediate mass range, interpolation can be performed as in the general\ncase up to the end of the tracks. After that, high mass stars are considered death while\nintermediate mass stars continue through the TP-AGB, computed as outlined below.\nThe case is somewhat more complicated if some tracks are in the intermediate-mass\nrange and some in the low-mass range. The stellar physical processes are qualitatively\nsimilar for both ranges up to the basis of the RGB: core H-burning (MS) or He-core\n\n\f\u2013 15 \u2013\ngravitationally contracting plus shell H-burning (sub-giant phase). Interpolation can hence\nbe performed up to that point but not afterward, when intermediate mass stars are about\nto start the core He-burning while low mass stars evolve climbing the RGB. In this case, the\nmass separating the intermediate and low mass ranges is firstly determined by logarithmic\ninterpolation between the four tracks embracing the mass and metallicity of the synthetic\nstar. This separating mass is used to determine the range to which the star belongs. After\nthis, interpolation is performed up to the RGB basis. Beyond that point, extrapolation is\nmade from tracks of the mass range to which the star belongs. The CMD related features\ncan be seen in Fig. 1\n\n6.3.\n\nVery high and very low mass stars\n\nThe stellar mass interval is controled by the input IMF. Stars of masses beyond the\ninterval covered by the chosen stellar evolution library are handled in different ways,\ndepending on the mass being larger than the maximum mass of the library or smaller than\nthe minimum one. In the first case the star is simply considered death. The case of very\nlow mass stars is more complex.\nThe smallest mass computed in the used libraries are given in Table 1. Stars less\nmassive than that have MS life times larger than the age of globular clusters and are\ncertainly in the MS for any realistic case. They are normally below the limiting magnitude\nin most CMDs of galaxies. However, they have a quite significant contribution to the total\nmass of the system and, also to the integrated luminosity, magnitudes and colors. Although\nthis contribution can be estimated by integration of the IMF, it may be useful to have\nthe possibility of explicitly computing their colors and magnitudes. To this purpose, the\nlibraries mentioned above have been completed downward in mass using the models by\nCassisi et al. (2000). They present MS L and Teff of stars with masses between \u223c 0.09 M\u2299\nand 0.8 M\u2299 for metallicity values in the range: 0.0002 \u2264 0.002. For present purpose these\nmodels have been completed with a very low mass sequence for solar chemical composition\n(Cassisi 2003, private communication). Since these stars have long evolution times and\nthe analysis of the CMD does not usually rely on their exact distribution in it, the effect\nof age on their L and Teff can be neglected. A polynomic fit has been performed, for each\nmetallicity, to the m \u2212 L and the m \u2212 Teff plots of the model stars. This can be used to\nestimate L and Teff of the synthetic star. The coefficients of the fit for the general equation\ny = a0 + a1 x + a2 x2 + a3 x3 + a4 x4 + a5 x5\n\n(7)\n\n\f\u2013 16 \u2013\nare given in Table 2. Here, x stands for log m and y for log L or log Teff , respectively.\nFigure 1 shows two models computed with these relations for masses 0.4 and 0.6\nM\u2299 and Z = 0.004. A good agreement exists with the Bertelli94 tracks. Consistence is\nalso quite good comparing with the Girardi00 and the Teramo libraries (not shown here).\nHowever the fact that the very low mass stars are computed from a different model set\n(namely the Cassisi et al. 2000 one) and that no age computation is made for them must be\ntaken into account if accurate analysis of CMD is intended in the region around 0.6 M\u2299 for\nthe Bertelli94 and the Teramo libraries and 0.15 M\u2299 for the Girardi00 library; i.e., around\nthe lower mass limits of these libraries.\n\n6.4.\n\nMass loss\n\nMass loss by stellar winds plays an important role in the evolution of massive stars.\nIt is included in the Bertelli94 computation for stars with initial mass larger than 12 M\u2299 .\nThe reader is referred to Bertelli94 for details. Besides massive stars, mass loss during the\nRGB and the AGB has dramatic consequences on the evolution of low and intermediate\nmass stars. In these cases the effects of mass loss are included at the moment of computing\nsynthetic stars in IAC-star. Unfortunately, mass loss during these phases and, in particular,\nduring the AGB depends on poorly known physical parameters that should be fine-tuned.\nIn the modeling of mass loss during these phases we follow the criteria given by Bertelli94\nand Marigo et al. (1996).\nMass loss during the RGB does not affect the internal structure of the star and can be\nneglected in the computation of L and Teff . However, the integrated mass loss during this\nphase determines the mass envelope of the subsequent HB stars and hence its Teff . For this\nreason, mass loss can be integrated during the RGB and introduced in a single step at the\ntip of the RGB (TRGB). To this purpose, the empirical relation by Reimers (1975) is used:\n\u22122\n\u1e41 = 1.27 \u00d7 10\u22125 \u03b7m\u22121 L1.5 Teff\nM\u2299 /yr\n\n(8)\n\nwhere L and m are in solar units and \u03b7 is a scaling parameter. The lowest stellar initial\nmass which evolution time up to the TRGB is smaller than or equal to the globular cluster\nage (about 13 Gyr) is about 0.80 \u2212 0.95 M\u2299 , depending on the metallicity, lower masses\ncorresponding to lower metallicities. From this, the mass loss during the RGB must be\nsubtracted. Since the core mass at the moment of the He-Flash is about 0.55 M\u2299 , the\nenvelope mass of these stars can be very small. As a consequence, the exact value adopted\nfor \u03b7 strongly affects Teff at the zero-age HB. In the current version of IAC-star, \u03b7 has a\n\n\f\u2013 17 \u2013\ndefault value of 0.35, but it can be modified by the user.\nComputing the mass loss during the AGB is more complicated. It can be neglected\nduring the E-AGB, but it is the key parameter controlling the final evolution of the\nstar during the TP-AGB. Stellar evolution models of low and intermediate-mass stars\nare in general computed up to the beginning of the TP-AGB only. From that point on,\ncomputation is performed within IAC-star following the prescriptions by Marigo et al.\n(1996). First, the starting point of the TP-AGB is assumed to be the point in the track\njust before the first significant He-shell flash. Hence, the evolution through the TP-AGB\nis followed using several basic relations: (i) the mass loss rate; (ii) a relation connecting\nthe core mass with the total luminosity of the star; (iii) the rate at which the core mass\nincreases as a result of shell H-burning, and (iv) an L \u2212 Teff relation for the TP-AGB.\nDetails on these relations can be found in Marigo et al. (1996) and references therein. We\nshortly summarize them here for self-consistency.\nThe mass loss rate is taken as the minimum of the two following values:\nlog \u1e41 = \u221211.4 + 0.0123P\n\u22121\n\u1e41 = 6.07023 \u00d7 10\u22123 Lc\u22121 vexp\n\n(9)\n(10)\n\nwhere m and L are the stellar mass and luminosity (in solar units), P is the pulsation\nperiod (in days) c is the light speed (in km s\u22121 ) and vexp is the terminal velocity of the\nstellar wind (in km s\u22121 ). Equations 9 and 10 stand for periods shorter and larger than\nabout 500 days, respectively. The wind expansion velocity is calculated in terms of the\nperiod as (Vassiliadis & Wood 1993):\nvexp = \u221213.5 + 0.056P\n\n(11)\n\nand the period is derived from the period-mass-radius relation by Vassiliadis & Wood\n(1993):\nlog P = \u22122.07 + 1.94 log R\u22c6 \u2212 0.9 log m\n\n(12)\n\nwhere R\u22c6 is the stellar radius in solar units.\nTo connect the core mass with the total luminosity of the star, the following two\nequations are used:\n\n\f\u2013 18 \u2013\n\n0.04\nL = 238000\u03bc3w ZCNO\n(m2c \u2212 0.0305mc \u2212 0.1802)\n\n(13)\n\nfor stars with core mass in the range 0.5 \u2264 mc \u2264 0.66 (Boothroyd & Sackmann 1988), and\nL = 122585\u03bc2w (mc \u2212 0.46)m0.19\n\n(14)\n\nfor stars with 0.95 \u2264 mc (Iben & Truran 1978; Groenewegen & de Jong 1993). For stars in\nthe interval 0.66 < mc < 0.95, linear interpolation is performed. In the former equations,\nZCNO is the total abundance (in mass fraction) of carbon, nitrogen and oxygen in the\nenvelope and \u03bcw = 4/(5X + 3 \u2212 Z) is the average molecular weight for a fully ionized gas,\nwhere X and Z are the hydrogen and metal abundances, respectively.\nThe rate at which the core mass increases as a result of shell H-burning is computed\nusing\n\u2202mc\nLH\n= 9.555 \u00d7 10\u221212\n\u2202t\nX\n\n(15)\n\nwhere X is the hydrogen abundance (in mass fraction) in the envelope and LH is the\nluminosity produced by the H-burning shell (in solar units). In fact, the latter is computed\nby the relation (Iben 1977):\nL = LH + 2000(M/7)0.4 exp[3.45(mc \u2212 0.96)]\n\n(16)\n\nFinally, the L \u2212 Teff relation of the TP-AGB is obtained by extrapolating the slope of\nthe E-AGB. In fact, to minimize random effects and possible inconsistencies, the slope is\ncomputed using the following relation, obtained by bi-logarithmic fit of the slopes of all the\nmodels at the end of the E-AGB:\nlog(\u2212\n\n\u2202L\n) = \u22122.870 + 0.994 log L \u2212 0.110 log Z\n\u2202Teff\n\n(17)\n\nwhere Z is the metallicity.\nUsing the former relations, the TP-AGB is computed for each HB and intermediate\nage evolutionary track with mass m \u2264 5M\u2299 , according to the intermediate mass limit found\nby Marigo et al. (1996). The TP-AGB computation is terminate either when the envelope\nmass is zero or the core mass reaches the Chandrasekhar limit (1.4 M\u2299 ).\n\n\f\u2013 19 \u2013\n7.\n\nRunning IAC-star\n\nIAC-star is made available for free use. It can be executed from the internet site\nhttp://iac-star.iac.es. A number of interactive software facilities are intended to be\nmade available from this site, together with IAC-star itself. In fact, the content and format\nof the page is expected to be up-dated, including new software and taking into account user\nfeed-backs. In the present form, a template is provided in which several input parameters\ncan be entered. For all them, default values as well as a brief option list for quick reference\nare available. Once all the inputs are provided, the user can request the program to be\nexecuted. This is performed by a dedicated computer at the Instituto de Astrof\u0131\u0301sica de\nCanarias (IAC). The resulting data file is stored upon completion in a public access ftp\ndirectory at the IAC. The address of this directory is given to the user by e-mail, to the\naddress provided by him or herself, together with the output file name and information on\nthe used inputs and the output file content. In the following we will describe the input\nparameters and the output file content. Since the specific content of both may change in\nfuture versions of the software, only a general description of them is provided. Detailed,\nupdated information can be found in the IAC-star internet site http://iac-star.iac.es.\n\n7.1.\n\nInput parameters\n\nThe input parameters are introduced as follows (see the IAC-star internet site,\nhttp://iac-star.iac.es, for updated details).\n\u2022 The chosen stellar evolution and bolometric correction libraries.\n\u2022 A seed for the random number generator. The routine used for random number\ngeneration is \"ran2\", obtained from Numerical Recipes in Fortran (Press et al. 1997).\n\u2022 Total number of stars computed or saved into the output file. To prevent too long\nruns, the maximum allowed total computed and saved stars are limited to some big\nnumbers.\n\u2022 The minimum stellar luminosity or maximum magnitude in a given filter. Although\nfainter stars are computed, only those brighter than this value are saved into the\noutput file.\n\u2022 The SFR, \u03c8(t). It is computed by interpolation between several \u03c8(t) nodes, defined\nby the user arbitrarily.\n\n\f\u2013 20 \u2013\n\u2022 The chemical enrichment law. Two alternative approaches are allowed to produce\nthe chemical enrichment law: (i) just an interpolation between several age-metallicity\nnodes, defined by the user and permitting a completely arbitrary metallicity law;\n(ii) computation from usual parameters involved in physical scenarios of chemical\nevolution, even though a self-consistent physical formulation is not intended in this\ncase. Metallicity dispersion is allowed in both cases.\n\u2022 The IMF. It is assumed to be a power law of the mass, but several mass intervals can\nbe defined.\n\u2022 Binary star control. Both the fraction of binary stars and the secondary to primary\nminimum mass ratio can be supplied.\n\u2022 Mass loss parameter. Although the default \u03b7 = 0.35 seems a reasonable choice, the\nuser can modify it here. It must be noted that \u03b7 significantly affects the extension of\nthe HB for low metallicity stars.\n\n7.2.\n\nThe output file content\n\nIn the current version, the content of the output file is organized as follows (see the\nIAC-star internet site, http://iac-star.iac.es, for updated details):\n\u2022 A head containing information about the input parameters. In particular: the libraries\nused, the total number of computed and stored stars; the minimum luminosity or\nmaximum magnitude stored; the current SFR, CEL and IMF laws; the fraction of\nbinaries and minimum secondary to primary mass ratio, and a heading line for the\ncolumn content, including a list of the photometric bands for which magnitudes have\nbeen computed.\n\u2022 Several lines each containing the information for a single or binary star. This\ninformation includes physical parameters (luminosity, temperature, gravity, mass and\nmetallicity), photometric parameters and age.\n\u2022 Closing: Integrated quantities are provided in the file closing lines, including the\ntotal number of ever formed, currently alive and stored stars; the total mass ever\nincorporated into stars (in other words, this is just the time integral of the SFR,\nRT\n0 \u03c8(t)dt); the mass currently locked into alive stars and into stellar remnants, and the\ntotal luminosity and the integrated magnitudes. Besides these integrated quantities,\nP\nthe logarithm of the sum of squared luminosities (log i L2i , where Li is the luminosity\n\n\f\u2013 21 \u2013\nof the i-th star if it is single or the total luminosity of the system, if it is binary) and\nthe magnitudes derived from this are also given. These are the magnitudes associated\nto surface brightness fluctuations (SBF). In this sense, IAC-star can be used as a SBF\npopulation synthesis code (see Mar\u0131\u0301n-Franch & Aparicio 2004).\n\n8.\n\nFinal remarks and conclusions\n\nThe program IAC-star, designed to generate synthetic CMDs is presented in this paper.\nIt calculates full synthetic stellar populations on a star by star basis, by computing the\nluminosity, effective temperature and magnitudes of each star. A variety of stellar evolution\nand bolometric correction libraries, SFR, IMF and CEL are allowed and binary stars can\nbe computed. The program provides also integrated masses, luminosities and magnitudes\nas well as SBF luminosity and magnitudes for the total synthetic stellar population. In this\nway, although it is mainly intended for synthetic CMD computation, it can be also used for\ntraditional and SBF population synthesis research.\nAmong the main characteristics of the program, the following are the most relevant:\n\u2022 Luminosity and effective temperatures of each star are computed by direct bilogarithmic interpolation in the age-metallicity grid of a stellar evolution library. Two\nPadua libraries (Bertelli94 and Girardi00) and the new Teramo library (Pietrinferni\net al. 2004) are used in the current version completed by the Cassisi et al. (2000)\nmodels for very low mass stars. This produces a smooth distribution of stars in the\noutput synthetic CMD which is necessary if accurate studies of SFH are intended.\n\u2022 Mass loss is computed during the RGB and the AGB phases.\n\u2022 The AGB phase is extended to the TP-AGB, covering in this way all the significant\nstellar evolution phases accurately.\n\u2022 Color and luminosities in a variety of visual broad band, infrared and HST filters are\nprovided. Bolometric correction transformations by Girardi et al. (2002); Castelli &\nKurucz (2002); Flucks et al. (1994); Lejeune, Cuisinier, & Buser (1997); and Origlia\n& Leitherer (2000) are used for this purpose.\nThe program is offered for free use and can be executed at the site\nhttp://iac-star.iac.es, with the only requirement of referencing this paper and\nacknowledging the IAC in any derived publication. It is intended to produce further\nimproved versions of the program after feed-back by the user community.\n\n\f\u2013 22 \u2013\nWe are deeply indebted to Cesare Chiosi, Gianpaolo Bertelli and other colleagues\nof the Padua stellar evolution group for a fruitful, long-term collaboration. Building up\nIAC-star would not have been possible without this collaboration. We are also indebted\nto Santi Cassisi for his help in the implementation of the Teramo stellar evolution library\nand corresponding bolometric corrections, and for many useful discussions and advice. The\nComputer Division of the IAC is acknowledged for implementing the hardware and the web\npage interface of the program. Financial support has be provided by the IAC Research\nDivision.

(2000) of age 10 Gyr (starred dots). Colors indicate different mass ranges, as follows.\nRed: high mass tracks; blue: intermediate mass tracks; magenta: low mass stars up to the\nHe-flash; black: low mass stars HB. In all the cases, dashed lines represent the TP-AGB\nextensions of the Padua tracks computed by IAC-star.

The\ncolor code is given in the figure, in Gyr. Labels indicate the evolutionary phase (see text for\nan explanation).\n\n\f\u2013 29 \u2013\n\nFig. 3.- Synthetic CMD computed using constant SFR from 13 Gyr ago to date and\nmetallicity linearly increasing from Z0 = 0.0001 to Zf = 0.001, Salpeter IMF, and a 0.3\nfraction of binary stars with minimum mass ratio 0.7. The Bertelli94 stellar evolution library\nand the Lejeune et al. (1997) bolometric correction library have been used. Colors and\nmagnitudes of binary stars are represented in green.

For \u03c8(t), an exponential law of the form \u03c8(t) = A exp(\u2212t/\u03b2\u03c8 ) has\nbeen used, where A is set to normalyze the integral of \u03c8(t) for the entyre life of the systen.\nTime scale is normalyzed, with the instant t = 0 corresponding to the beginning of the\nstar formation and the instant t = 1 corresponding to its end. In the upper window the\nparameter choices are displayed. Bracketed figures correspond to [\u03b2\u03c8 , \u03bcf , \u03b1, \u03bb]. Closed-box\nmodels are drawn in blue, infall models are drawn in red and outflow models in magenta.\n\n\f\u2013 31 \u2013\n\nFig. 5.- Example of a CEL with metallicity dispersion. A constant SFR has been used\nwith \u03b1 = \u03bb = 0 and \u03bcf = 0.2 in both cases, but Z0 = 0, Zf = 0.01 for the lower law and\nZ0 = 0.004, Zf = 0.02 for the upper one. Time scale is normalyzed, with the instant t = 0\ncorresponding to the beginning of the star formation and the instant t = 1 corresponding to\nits end. For each age, stars would have metallicities comprised within the shaded area.\n\n\f"}
