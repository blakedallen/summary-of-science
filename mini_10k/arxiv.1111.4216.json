INTRODUCTION\n\nThe discovery of one or more pulsars in the inner parsecs around Sgr A*, the massive black hole (MBH) at\nthe center of our Galaxy, would provide an invaluable\ntool for studying the innermost regions of the Galactic\ncenter (GC). Most of the current understanding of the\ninner parsec comes from infrared observations of the nuclear star cluster (for a recent review, see Genzel et al.\n2010). The nuclear star cluster is centered on Sgr A*\nand consists of young massive stars at a projected radius\nof r \u2248 0.5 pc and a dense collection of B-stars (the \"Sstars\") within r \u2264 0.04 pc with the closest orbit passing\njust 6 \u00d7 10\u22124 pc (\u2248100 AU) from Sgr A* (Sch\u00f6del et al.\n2002; Ghez et al. 2003). Two decades of monitoring the\norbits of these S-stars has yielded the mass of the central\nobject to be M = 4 \u00d7 106 M\u2299 , unambiguously classifying\nit as a MBH (Ghez et al. 2008; Gillessen et al. 2009).\nDespite the success of tracking stellar orbits in the infrared, the sensitivity of this method is ultimately limited\nby source confusion. The detection of a radio pulsar at a\nsimilar distance with an orbital period of Porb . 100 yr\nwould provide unparalleled tests of gravity in the strongfield regime. The timing of such a pulsar could allow the\nmeasurement of the spin or quadrupole moment of the\nMBH (Pfahl & Loeb 2004; Laguna & Wolszczan 1997;\nWex & Kopeikin 1999; Liu et al. 2012). Additionally, a\npulsar found anywhere in the inner few parsecs of the\nGalaxy would provide a useful probe of the GC environment. The mere detection of a pulsar would place con1 Department of Astronomy, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY\n14853\n2 Arecibo Observatory, HC3 Box 53995, Arecibo, PR 00612\n3 Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology,\nM/S 138-308, 4800 Oak Grove Dr., Pasadena, CA 91109\n* Email: rwharton@astro.cornell.edu\n\nstraints on the star formation history (SFH) and measurements of the dispersion measure and pulse broadening times would provide information on the electron\ndensity distribution of the region.\nHowever, even with the detection of almost 2000 radio\npulsars in the Galaxy (Manchester et al. 2005) and several directed searches of the GC, only five pulsars have\nbeen found within 15\u2032 of Sgr A* and the closest of these\nis 11\u2032 away (Deneva et al. 2009; Johnston et al. 2006;\nBates et al. 2011). While these few objects indicate the\nexistence of a GC pulsar population, the perceived dearth\nof pulsars near Sgr A* is the result of interstellar scattering from turbulent plasma, which temporally broad\u22124\nens pulses to approximately 2000\u03bdGHz\ns (where \u03bdGHz is\nthe observing frequency in GHz) at the center of the\nGalaxy (Cordes & Lazio 2002). Pulse broadening makes\nit almost impossible to detect even long-period pulsars\nin periodicity searches at commonly used frequencies\n(\u03bd \u223c 1 GHz). To mitigate the deleterious effects of interstellar scattering, periodicity searches of the GC have\nmigrated to higher frequencies (\u03bd \u223c 10 GHz). However, since pulsars have power-law spectra of the form\nS(\u03bd) \u221d \u03bd \u03b1 (with \u03b1 < 0), increasing the observing frequency also decreases the observable flux density. To\ndate, high-frequency searches have produced no new detections using existing 100 m class telescopes (Deneva\n2010; Macquart et al. 2010).\nEven though the absence of pulsar detections in the central parsecs of the GC is well explained by scattering effects, the existence of a GC pulsar population was established by Deneva et al. (2009) based on the five pulsars\non the outskirts of the region that cannot be explained\nas foreground disk objects. Since future surveys can benefit from better knowledge of the pulsar populations in\nthe GC, we use a suite of multiwavelength observations\n\n\f2\nN\n\nE\n\nRadio (8.5 GHz)\nN\n\nE\n\nX-ray (0.5\u22127 keV)\nN\n\nE\n\nIR (1.25 \u03bcm)\nFigure 1.

An illustration of the structure of the GC\non these scales is shown in Figure 1.\nIn this paper, we present observational constraints on the\npulsar populations in the GC. A brief overview of the conventions and notations used in this paper are presented\nin Section 2. In Section 3, population limits are set from\nthe detections of pulsars in the inner 15\u2032 and from nondetections in the vicinity of Sgr A* on parsec scales. In\nSection 4, a catalog of steep-spectrum radio sources in\nthe inner 150 pc is considered. Interferometric measure-\n\nments of the spectrum of Sgr A* are used in Section 5\nto set upper limits on the pulsar population in the GC\nonNarcsecond scales. In Section 6, Fermi observations of\nthe diffuse gamma-ray flux of the inner degree of the GC\nare used to estimate the millisecond pulsar population\nin the GC. In Section 7, infrared observations of young\nmassive stars are used to estimate the number of neutron\nstars produced in the inner parsec of the Galaxy. Chandra X-ray observations of pulsar wind nebulae are used\nto constrain the pulsar population in the inner 20 pc in\nSection 8. In Section 9, limits are set on the intrinsic neutron star population in the GC based on the estimated\nsupernova rate. Finally, in Section 10, the estimates are\nsummarized and discussed.\n2. CONVENTIONS AND NOTATIONS\n\nWe note briefly a few conventions and notations that we\nadopt in this paper. The name \"Sgr A*\" is used to describe both the MBH and the compact radio source at the\ndynamical center of the Galaxy. In the event where a distinction must be made (for example, Section 5), \"Sgr A*\"\nis taken to mean the observed radio source. All distances\nfrom Sgr A* are given as a projected distance unless explicitly stated otherwise. The distance from Earth to\nSgr A* is taken to be d = 8.5 kpc (Ghez et al. 2008;\nGillessen et al. 2009).\nPulse broadening times are taken from the NE2001\nelectron density model of Cordes & Lazio (2002). The\nNE2001 model accounts for the geometry of the scattering region in the GC, and as such, it is preferable over empirical fits to pulsars in the Galactic disk (e.g. Bhat et al.\n2004), which do not consider the particular scattering geometry of the GC. As discussed in Deneva et al. (2009),\nNE2001 tends to overestimate the scattering times for the\nfive pulsars closest to Sgr A* by factors of \u223c102 \u2212 103 .\nHowever, these pulsars likely lie along the edges of the\nGC scattering region where slight (\u223c0.1 kpc) changes to\nthe line of sight distance can cause dramatic (factors of\n\u223c104 ) changes in scattering times with only modest (factor of \u223c2) changes in dispersion measure. Additionally,\nwe note that the scattering times of pulsars deeper in the\nGC will be highly constrained by the measured angular\nscattering of Sgr A* itself.\nPulse broadening times are found at arbitrary observing frequencies by scaling the 1 GHz values given by\nNE2001 as \u221d \u03bd \u22124 (Lambert & Rickett 1999). However,\nsee L\u00f6hmer et al. (2001) for potentially significant deviations from this scaling in highly scattered pulsars.\nAll pulsar population estimates are given as the number of active radio pulsars beamed toward the Earth,\nwhere a beaming fraction of fb = 0.2 is assumed for all\npulsars. The fixed beaming fraction of fb = 0.2 comes\nfrom a simple model in which the magnetic dipole moment is oriented randomly with respect to the rotation\naxis (Emmering & Chevalier 1989). A better empirical fit to the data is provided by the period-dependent\nmodel of Tauris & Manchester (1998), which typically\nfinds fb \u223c 0.1 for isolated pulsars. However, since the\nTauris & Manchester (1998) model does not include millisecond pulsars that may have beaming fractions as high\nas fb \u2248 0.5 \u2212 0.9 (Kramer et al. 1998), we adopt the\nfb = 0.2 value as a population-wide representative value.\nAs this factor only shows up in our analysis as a mul-\n\n\fConstraints on GC Pulsar Populations\ntiplicative constant, it is trivial to scale our results to\ndifferent beaming fractions.\nIn many of the limits presented below, it will be necessary\nto utilize a distribution for pulsar pseudo-luminosities\n(L = Sd2 ). We adopt the power-law distribution of\nLorimer et al. (2006) with a minimum cutoff in preference to distributions that do not require cutoffs like the\nlog-normal model of Faucher-Gigu\u00e8re & Kaspi (2006).\nBoth are two parameter models and the power-law distribution provides a much better empirical fit to the observations (see, e.g., Figure 6 of Lorimer et al. 2006). However, if the log-normal distribution were used instead of\nthe power-law in the calculations below, the total pulsar populations predicted would be larger by factors of\n10\u2013100 owing to the much larger fraction of low luminosity objects. As a result, our adoption of the power-law\npseudo-luminosity distribution is a conservative one in\nthe sense that using another distribution would predict\na larger pulsar population.\nLastly, we note that in some cases our constraints will\ninvolve all types of pulsars, while others involve one of\ntwo subsets of pulsars: the \"canonical\" pulsars (CPs)\nand recycled or \"millisecond\" pulsars (MSPs). CPs have\nperiods of P \u223c 1 s, surface magnetic fields B \u223c 1012 G\nand active radio lifetimes of \u03c4 \u223c 107 years, while MSPs\nhave periods P . 10 ms, low surface magnetic fields B .\n109 G and active radio lifetimes of \u03c4 \u223c 109 \u2212 1010 years.\n3. CONSTRAINTS FROM PULSAR SURVEYS OF THE GC\n\nSeveral pulsar searches have been conducted in the inner\ndegree of the Galaxy. To date, only five pulsars have been\ndetected within 15\u2032 of Sgr A*, with none closer than 11\u2032\n(Manchester et al. 2005). To have any chance of making detections in the inner few arcminutes of the Galaxy,\nhigher observing frequencies must be used to overcome\n\u22124\ns broadening times caused by scatthe roughly 2000\u03bdGHz\ntering. Deep searches have been attempted at frequencies\nfrom 4 to 15 GHz, but have made no detections in the\ninner few parsecs around Sgr A* (Johnston et al. 2006;\nDeneva 2010; Macquart et al. 2010). Both the pulsar detections in \"low-frequency\" (2\u20133 GHz) surveys and the\nabsence of detections in high-frequency (4\u201315 GHz) directed searches can be used to constrain the GC pulsar\npopulation.\n3.1. GC Pulsar Detections in Low-Frequency Surveys\n\nThe five known pulsars within 15\u2032 of Sgr A* currently\nprovide the best direct evidence for an intrinsic GC\npulsar population. Of these five pulsars, two were\ndetected at 3.1 GHz with the Parkes radio telescope\n(Johnston et al. 2006) and three5 were detected at 2 GHz\nwith the Green Bank Telescope (Deneva et al. 2009). In\neach of these surveys, the expected number of detectable\ndisk pulsars in the field of view is \u226a 1. Thus, the detections strongly suggest a pulsar population in the GC\nthat is distinct from that of the disk.\nIn an attempt to constrain the number and spatial distribution of the GC pulsars, Deneva et al. (2009) simulated\nthe pulsar population to determine what would be consistent with the survey detections. A simple two-component\n5 One of these pulsars, J1746\u22122850, was independently discovered by Bates et al. (2011) in a Parkes 6.5 GHz multibeam survey.\n\n3\n\ndensity model of the form\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\nr2\nh2\nexp \u2212 2\nnGC \u221d exp \u2212 2\nHGC\nRGC\n\n(1)\n\nwas adopted with HGC = 26 pc fixed to coincide with\nthe scale height of the scattering screen in the NE2001\nelectron density model of Cordes & Lazio (2002). The\ndensity distribution was normalized so that, for a given\nRGC , there were a total of NGC pulsars (not necessarily\nbeamed toward Earth) associated with the population.\nUsing Monte Carlo methods, Deneva et al. (2009) then\ngenerated 1000 pulsar populations consistent with Equation 1 for each (RGC , NGC ) pair and determined how\nmany of these pulsars would have been detected in their\n2.1 GHz survey. Searching over a grid of values and\nperforming a maximum likelihood analysis, Deneva et al.\n(2009) found lower bounds of NGC & 2000 and RGC &\n0.3 kpc for the parameters. Thus, this analysis provides\nadditional evidence for an intrinsic pulsar population in\nthe GC.\nAlthough Deneva et al. (2009) have set a lower bound on\nNGC , this parameter applies to the entire GC population\nand does not necessarily translate into a lower bound\non the number of pulsars within a particular distance\nfrom Sgr A*. For example, a distribution with NGC =\n2000 and RGC = 0.3 kpc will produce a very different\nnumber of pulsars within 100 pc of Sgr A* than will\na distribution with NGC = 2000 and RGC = 0.6 kpc.\nRegardless, the existence of a pulsar population in the\nGC is firmly established.\nWe note briefly that the primary reason the Deneva et al.\n(2009) analysis does not find upper bounds on the parameters NGC and RGC even after extending the grid\nto NGC = 104 and RGC = 5 kpc is that the only constraints come from the detections in the survey region\n(r . 50 pc). Incorporating survey results from the inner few degrees of the Galaxy would certainly introduce\nupper bounds to the parameters.\nWith this in mind, it is instructive to consider the results\nat a fixed RGC . From Figure 4 of Deneva et al. (2009),\nwe see that a wide range of NGC values with NGC &\n500 are equally likely for RGC = 0.1 kpc. Thus, a very\nconservative lower bound on the number of pulsars in\nthe inner 100 pc of the Galaxy that are beamed toward\nEarth is Npsr & 100 (where we have assumed a beaming\nfraction of 0.2).\n3.2. High-Frequency Pulsar Searches of the Central\n\nParsec\nRecently, searches of the central few parsecs around\nSgr A* have been conducted with the Green Bank Telescope (GBT) at 5 GHz and 9 GHz (Deneva 2010) and at\n15 GHz (Macquart et al. 2010). No pulsars were detected\nin any of these searches. We follow a similar analysis to\nthat of Macquart et al. (2010) to estimate an upper limit\nto the pulsar population based on the absence of detections.\n3.2.1. Observations\n\nThe 5 and 9 GHz observations were carried out by\nDeneva (2010) in 2006. Since no pulsar candidates were\n\n\f4\ndetected, limits on the flux density of periodic signals\nmay be set using the radiometer equation\nSmin,\u03bd =\n\nmTsys\np\n,\n\u03b7G Nh Npol \u2206\u03bdTobs\n\n(2)\n\nwhere Tsys is the system temperature, G is the telescope\ngain, \u03b7 \u2248 0.8 is a correction factor that accounts for\nsystem imperfections and the digitization of the signal,\nNh = 16 is the maximum number of harmonics summed\nin a periodicity search, Npol = 2 is the number of polarization channels summed, \u2206\u03bd = 800 MHz is the receiver bandwidth and Tobs = 6.5 hr is the observation\ntime. The telescope gain is given by G = 1.85 K Jy\u22121\nand G = 1.8 K Jy\u22121 for observing frequencies of 5 and\n9 GHz, respectively. The value of m is determined by the\ndetection significance threshold set at m\u03c3. In this FFT\nsearch the threshold was set to 6\u03c3, so m = 6.\nThe system temperature of the telescope is given by6\nTsys = Trec +Tbg . The receiver temperature of the GBT7\nis 18 K at 5 GHz and 27 K at 9 GHz. The dominant contribution to the background temperature is the bright\nextended Sgr A Complex (comprised of Sgr A East and\nSgr A West), which surrounds Sgr A*. We may set lower\nbounds on this background using data from a multiwavelength survey by Law et al. (2008), which imaged the GC\nat 1.4, 5 and 9 GHz. Only lower bounds may be set since\na non-trivial iterative scheme was used to subtract out\nthe noise contributions from the atmosphere. Law et al.\n(2008) found the flux density of the Sgr A Complex\nto be 85 Jy beam\u22121 at 5 GHz and 39 Jy beam\u22121 at\n9 GHz, which translate to background temperatures of\nTbg = 157 K and Tbg = 70 K, respectively. Thus, the\nsystem temperature is Tsys = 175 K at 5 GHz and\nTsys = 97 K at 9 GHz. From Equation 2, we find that\nSmin,\u03bd = 29 \u03bcJy at 5 GHz and Smin,\u03bd = 17 \u03bcJy at 9 GHz.\nLikewise, Macquart et al. (2010) conducted a search for\npulsars at 14.8 and 14.4 GHz using the GBT in 2006\nand 2008. The Macquart et al. (2010) search used a 10\u03c3\ndetection threshold and combined observations to get an\neffective observation time of Tobs \u2248 9.75 hr. The system\ntemperature was determined to be Tsys \u2248 35 K by firing\na noise diode on a calibrator source. No pulsars were\ndetected and a 10\u03c3 detection threshold flux density of\nSmin,\u03bd \u2248 10 \u03bcJy is set from the 14.4 GHz measurements.\n3.2.2. Upper Limits on Observable Pulsar Population\n\nAssuming that a given pulsar in the GC will be detected\nwith some probability pd , binomial statistics can be used\nto find the maximum number of pulsars consistent with\nzero detections. The simplest way to determine pd is to\nset it equal to the fraction of pulsars bright enough to be\nseen in each survey when placed at Sgr A*. This fraction\ncan be estimated from the 1.4 GHz pseudo-luminosity\nfunction, which is given by dN/d log L \u221d L\u2212\u03b2 taken over\na range of pseudo-luminosities from Lmin = 0.1 mJy kpc2\nto Lmax = 104 mJy kpc2 . We adopt a value of \u03b2 = \u22120.7\n6 We take T\nrec to include all non-astronomical contributions to\nthe system temperature from the receiver, spillover effects, and the\natmosphere.\n7\nAs\nprovided\nin\nthe\nGBT\nProposer's\nGuide:\nhttp://www.gb.nrao.edu/gbtprops/man/GBTpg.pdf\n\nas an average of the two fits found by Lorimer et al.\n(2006) of over 1000 pulsars observed in the Parkes Multibeam Survey. The detection probability is then given by\npd = fL (L > Ldet ), where\n\u0013\u22121.7\n\u0012\n1.4 GHz\nd2gc\n(3)\nLdet = Smin,\u03bd\n\u03bd\nand Smin,\u03bd is the minimum detectable flux density of\nthe search. Using the Smin,\u03bd values found by each search\n(see Table 1) we find that pd = (0.027, 0.020, 0.015) at\n\u03bd = (5, 9, 15) GHz.\nGiven the above detection probabilities and the lack of\nany detections in the surveys, the upper limits to the\nnumber of pulsars (at 99% confidence level) are found to\nbe N = (170, 230, 299) for the 5, 9, and 15 GHz observations, respectively. However, since a pulsar with a spin\nperiod less than the pulse broadening time would have\na greatly reduced chance of being detected, the calculated upper limits are for pulsars with P & \u03c4sc . Using\nthe 1 GHz scattering time from the NE2001 model of\nCordes & Lazio (2002) and scaling (\u221d \u03bd \u22124 ) to the appropriate frequency, the scatter broadening times are found\nto be \u03c4sc = (4.2, 0.44, 0.05) s at observing frequencies of\n\u03bd = (5, 9, 15) GHz.\n3.2.3. Implications for Total GC Pulsar Population\n\nThe upper limits of Section 3.2.2 are only valid for pulsars within certain period ranges. To make an estimate of\nthe total number of pulsars, knowledge of the underlying\npulsar period distribution is needed. Though the period\ndistribution of pulsars in the inner parsecs of the GC\nis entirely unknown, a reasonable approximation would\nbe to assume the same distribution as the local pulsar\npopulation (to reduce observational biases). From the\nATNF pulsar catalog8 (Manchester et al. 2005), we see\nthat there are 88 pulsars within 1 kpc of Earth. Of\nthese, 5 have P > 4.2 s, 38 have P > 0.44 s and 55\nhave P > 50 ms. This gives fP (P > 4.2 s) = 0.06,\nfP (P > 0.44 s) = 0.43 and fP (P > 50 ms) = 0.63 for\nthe fractions of pulsars with periods greater than the\nscatter broadening times.\nAssuming these values are representative of the GC population, we can estimate upper bounds on the total\nnumber of pulsars (regardless of period) to be Nmax =\nN/fP . Applying these corrections to the estimates of\nSection 3.2.2 gives Nmax = (2830, 535, 475) for observing\nfrequencies of \u03bd = (5, 9, 15) GHz.\nThe half-power beam width of the GBT is \u03b8(\u03bd) \u2248\n\u2032\u2032\n150 (\u03bd/5 GHz)\u22121 . At Sgr A*, the projected radii of\nthese beams are r \u2248 (3.0, 1.5, 1.0) pc at 5, 9 and 15 GHz,\nrespectively. Thus, we estimate that there are as many\nas Nmax < 2830 pulsars beamed toward Earth within\nr \u2248 3.0 pc of Sgr A*, Nmax < 535 within r \u2248 1.5 pc and\nNmax < 475 within r \u2248 1 pc.\nThe results of this section are summarized in Table 1. In addition to the surveys of Deneva (2010)\nand Macquart et al. (2010), we also include for reference the less sensitive GC pointings from surveys by\nJohnston et al. (2006) and Bates et al. (2011).\n8\n\nhttp://www.atnf.csiro.au/research/pulsar/psrcat/\n\n\fConstraints on GC Pulsar Populations\n\n5\n\nTable 1\nPulsar Upper Limits of High-Frequency Surveys of the Central Parsecs\n\u03bd\n(GHz)\n(1)\n\nSmin\n(\u03bcJy)\n(2)\n\n\u03c4sc\n(s)\n(3)\n\nfL (L > Ldet )\n\nN (P & \u03c4sc )\n\nfP (P > \u03c4sc )\n\n(4)\n\n(5)\n\n(6)\n\n4.85\n6.6\n8.4\n8.50\n14.4\n\n29\n550\u2020\n200\n17\n10\n\n4.2\n1.28\n0.46\n0.44\n0.05\n\n0.027\n0.002\n0.003\n0.020\n0.015\n\n< 170\n< 2220\n< 1380\n< 230\n< 299\n\n0.06\n0.17\n0.43\n0.43\n0.63\n\nN/fP\n\nRef\n\n(7)\n\nr\n(pc)\n(8)\n\n< 2830\n< 13000\n< 3200\n< 535\n< 475\n\n3.0\n4.0\n3.0\n1.5\n1.0\n\n(1)\n(2)\n(3)\n(1)\n(4)\n\n(9)\n\nNotes.

Caveats\n\nA number of assumptions are made in the upper limit\nestimates of the previous sections, so it is important to\nconsider what happens if the assumptions fail. The first\nassumption is that the probability of detecting a pulsar\n(with period large enough not to be smeared out by interstellar scattering) is equal to the fraction of pulsars\nwith 1.4 GHz pseudo-luminosities large enough to be detected at the GC. Since the detection probability only\nconsiders the best-case sensitivity of the telescope and\nignores any effects of radio-frequency interference at the\ntelescope end or intermittency at the pulsar end, it is\nlikely to be an overestimate. An overestimate of the detection probability would result in an underestimate of\nthe upper bound on the number of pulsars.\nAnother assumption is that the 1.4 GHz pseudoluminosity distribution of pulsars in the GC is the same\nas those in the Galactic field. However, if the GC region\ncontains a larger number of low-luminosity MSPs, then\nthe detection probability will again be overestimated and\nthe upper limit underestimated. One could also imagine the case where enough bright young pulsars exist in\nthe GC as a result of recent star formation to skew the\npseudo-luminosity distribution to higher luminosities. In\nthat case, the detection probability would be an underestimate and the upper limits an overestimate.\nWe have also assumed that the upper limits are for pulsars with P > \u03c4sc . However, as the scattering time gets\nto be a significant fraction of the pulsar period, it will\nstart to smear out the signal and reduce the number of\ndetectable harmonics. Since this is a gradual process,\nit will likely make some pulsars undetectable even with\nP > \u03c4sc . As a result, we would be overestimating the\nminimal detectable period, which would cause the upper\nbound to be an underestimate.\nFinally, we have assumed that the period distribution\nof the pulsars within 1 kpc of Earth is representative of\nthe GC population. This certainly does not have to be\n\nthe case, as the star formation histories of the Galactic field and GC are likely to be different. For example,\nthe GC could potentially have a much higher concentration of young pulsars and old MSPs as compared to\nthe Galactic disk. The increased stellar encounter rate in\nthe GC could favor MSP production and any recent starburst would favor young pulsars. In both cases, the periods would be biased low. Thus, the period distribution\nwould be skewed lower than assumed and the fraction of\npulsars with periods greater than a certain value will be\noverestimated. This will result in the upper bound being\nunderestimated.\nSince most of the assumptions made tend to decrease the\nupper limits, our estimates are best interpreted as the\nmost restrictive upper bounds to the pulsar population\nin the inner few parsecs of the GC.\n4. RADIO POINT SOURCES\n\nMotivated by the study of GC pulsar search methods\nby Cordes & Lazio (1997), Lazio & Cordes (2008) performed a VLA survey of compact radio sources in the\ninner degree of the Galaxy. Though pulsars cannot be\nidentified by their pulsed emission in an imaging survey, promising pulsar candidates may be found by looking for steep-spectrum sources with angular diameters\nconsistent with the angular broadening of point sources\ncaused by scattering at locations near Sgr A* (\u22481\u2032\u2032 at\n1 GHz). Of the 170 compact radio sources cataloged,\nLazio & Cordes (2008) estimate that the number of pulsars included is of order \u223c10. Based on this survey, upper limits to the pulsar population within 1\u25e6 (\u2248150 pc)\nof Sgr A* may be estimated.\n4.1. Observations\n\nThe survey was conducted at observing frequencies of\n1.4 and 5 GHz with the VLA in the A configuration. A\ntotal of 13 fields arranged in a hexagonal grid covered the\nregion of the GC out to roughly 1\u25e6 (150 pc) from Sgr A*\n\n\f6\n(the half-power radius of the VLA primary beam is 15\u2032\nat 1.4 GHz). The typical resolution for the survey was a\nsynthesized beam size of 2.\u2032\u2032 4 \u00d7 1.\u2032\u2032 3.\nSources were identified using a method similar to that\nof Lazio & Cordes (1998). Essentially, a histogram of\nintensities was constructed from the image of the primary\nbeam for each field. If the field just contained noise, the\nintensity histogram would be a Gaussian with a mean of\nzero and a standard deviation equal to the thermal noise\nof 0.05 mJy per synthesized beam. Sources could then\nbe determined by looking for deviations from this noiseonly histogram. In practice, the histogram was found\nto have larger tails than a Gaussian, with zero mean\nand a standard deviation of \u22480.5 mJy beam\u22121 . Since\nthe resolution is comparable to the scattering size of a\npoint source at the distance of Sgr A*, a 10\u03c3 detection\nthreshold of Sdet \u2248 5 mJy was adopted for the survey.\n4.2. Pulsar Population Estimate\n\nGiven that Nobs \u223c 10 pulsars were likely observed, the\ntotal pulsar population in the survey region can be estimated as Npsr \u223c Nobs /fL , where fL is the fraction of\npulsars luminous enough to be detected at the distance\nof Sgr A*. Taking the survey detection threshold to be\nSdet = 5 mJy at 1.4 GHz, a pulsar must have a 1.4 GHz\npseudo-luminosity of at least Ldet = 360 mJy kpc2\nto be detected at the distance of Sgr A*. The fraction of pulsars with L > Ldet can be determined from\nthe 1.4 GHz pulsar luminosity function, which has the\nform dN/d log L \u221d L\u2212\u03b2 . The range of pulsar pseudoluminosities is taken from Lmin = 0.1 mJy kpc2 to\nLmax = 104 mJy kpc2 and the exponent in the distribution function is taken to be \u03b2 = 0.7 (Lorimer et al.\n2006). From this distribution, the fraction of pulsars luminous enough to be detected is fL = 3 \u00d7 10\u22123 . For\nNobs \u223c 10 pulsars detected in the survey, we expect a total population of Npsr \u223c 3000 pulsars within 1\u25e6 (150 pc)\nof Sgr A*.\nThough Npsr \u223c 3000 is the nominal population estimate\nfrom the survey, a broader range results if the assumptions do not exactly hold. For instance, Lazio & Cordes\n(2008) estimate that Nobs \u223c 10 of the unidentified steepspectrum point sources will ultimately turn out to be\nradio pulsars. However, this number could range from\nzero to about 30. If one takes Nobs = 30, repeating the\nabove analysis gives a pulsar population of Npsr \u223c 104 .\nAdditionally, one may consider the case in which no pulsars were detected. Despite a follow-up observation of 15\nof the pulsar candidates in this survey by Deneva (2010)\nwith the GBT, none of the candidates have to date been\nconfirmed. Assuming zero detections, an analysis similar to that in Section 3.2 gives an upper limit to the\npulsar population of Npsr \u2264 1500 at a 99% confidence\nlevel. These two extremes illustrate that although the\nsurvey allows for an estimate of the pulsar population in\nthe inner degree of about 3000, the actual number could\nbe below 1500 or as high as 104 . As a result, we take\nNpsr . 104 as a conservative upper bound.\nFinally, we note that although the survey covers the region within 1\u25e6 (150 pc) of Sgr A*, there will be reduced\nsensitivity in the field centered on Sgr A*. The reduced\nsensitivity is the result of increased background temper-\n\natures and greater sidelobes from the extended structure\nof the inner GC. In addition, since the scatter-broadening\nof point sources in the vicinity of Sgr A* (\u22481\u2032\u2032 ) is comparable to the resolution of the survey, source confusion\nmay become important in the innermost regions of the\nGC. Therefore, this survey would be largely insensitive\nto a fairly compact population of pulsars in the inner\ntens of arcseconds around Sgr A*.\n5. RADIO SPECTRUM OF SGR A*\n\nIn this section, limits are placed on the maximum allowable number of pulsars in the inner parsecs of the GC\nbased on radio interferometer observations of Sgr A* on\narcsecond scales (1\u2032\u2032 \u2248 0.04 pc at 8.5 kpc). Due to the\nfinite resolution of interferometers and the broadening of\nangular diameters as a result of the interstellar scattering of radio waves, the Sgr A* radio source is actually\nextended (\u22481\u2032\u2032 at 1 GHz). Flux measurements of Sgr A*\nwill therefore include a contribution from a collection of\npulsars, if such a population exists. Although these pulsars will be unresolved, upper limits on the total population may be set based on the total flux density of Sgr A*\nin a manner analogous to similar constraints placed on\npulsars in globular clusters (Fruchter & Goss 1990).\nWe consider a model in which the observed flux density\nof Sgr A* is actually the combination of two components.\nThe first component is that due to radio emission from\nthe immediate environment of the MBH itself, which we\nassume is described accurately by high frequency observations where the pulsar component is negligible. The\nsecond component is that due to the population of pulsars near the MBH. This pulsar component becomes important at lower frequencies both because radio pulsars\ntypically have steep spectra and the angular resolution of\nradio telescopes scales with frequency such that a larger\nregion around the MBH is sampled at lower frequencies.\nBy requiring that this model flux be consistent with existing observations, constraints may be set on the maximum number of pulsars allowed in the inner parsec of\nthe Galaxy.\n5.1. Observations\n\nTwo different measurements of the spectrum of Sgr A*\nover a wide range of frequencies are considered (An et al.\n2005; Falcke et al. 1998). An et al. (2005) conducted\nsimultaneous measurements of Sgr A* from 300 MHz\nto 43 GHz using the VLA (A-configuration) and the\nGMRT. Falcke et al. (1998) made simultaneous measurements of Sgr A* using the VLA (A-configuration), the\nBerkeley-Illinois-Maryland Array, the Nobeyama 45 m\ntelescope, and the Institut de Radioastronomie Millimetrique (IRAM) 30 m telescope from 1.4 GHz to\n235 GHz. Both groups observed a broken power-law\nspectrum with a break around 10 GHz. Since the powerlaw spectrum of pulsars decreases with increasing frequency, a population of pulsars contributes significantly\nonly at lower frequencies. As a result, we consider the\nspectrum of Sgr A* only below the break frequency at\n10 GHz.\n5.2. Spectral Model\n\nWe model the measured flux density of the compact radio source Sgr A* as the sum of contributions from a\n\n\fConstraints on GC Pulsar Populations\ncollection of pulsars and a point source associated with\nthe MBH attenuated by free-free absorption according\nto\n\u0012 \u0013\u03b1psr \u0015\n\u0012 \u0013\u03b1bh\n\u0014\n\u03bd\n\u03bd\n+ N (\u03bd)Spsr,\u03bd0\nSSgr (\u03bd) = SBH,\u03bd0\n\u03bd0\n\u03bd0\n\u00d7 exp(\u2212\u03bdf2 /\u03bd 2 ).\n\n(4)\n\nThe emission from the immediate vicinity of the MBH,\nSBH,\u03bd0 , is taken to be a point source with a power-law\nspectrum with spectral index \u03b1bh . N (\u03bd) is the number of\npulsars contained in the solid angle of the effective pointspread function or beam size, which depends strongly on\nfrequency (see Section 5.3). We use a simplified scaling\nfor the free-free absorption that ignores the frequency\ndependence of the Gaunt factor. The free-free absorption factor has a turnover frequency \u03bdf (An et al. 2005).\nThe flux density per pulsar, Spsr,\u03bd0 , is taken to be the\nmean of the 1.4 GHz pulsar pseudo-luminosity distribution given by dN/d log L \u221d L\u22120.7 (Lorimer et al. 2006)\nwith a lower cutoff of Lmin = 0.1 mJy kpc2 and an upper cutoff of Lmax = 104 mJy kpc2 . The mean observed\nflux density at 1.4 GHz is Spsr,1.4 = 99 \u03bcJy. Since pulsar\nradio flux scales with frequency as a simple power-law,\nwe can scale our flux density as S\u03bd \u221d \u03bd \u03b1psr . We fix\n\u03b1psr = \u22121.7 as a nominal value for the pulsar spectral\nindex (Maron et al. 2000; Lorimer et al. 1995), but also\nconsider values of \u22121.0 and \u22122.5 to test any major spectral index dependence.\n5.3. Effective Angular Resolution\n\nThe number of pulsars included in a flux measurement\nof Sgr A* can be written as an integral of the number of\npulsars per unit solid angle,\nZ\ndnp\n.\n(5)\nN (\u03bd) = d\u03a9\nd\u03a9\nThe integral is over the effective solid angle \u03a9eff (\u03bd) =\n2\n(\u03c0/4)\u03b8eff\n(\u03bd), where\n\u00011/2\n\u0002\n\u00031/2\n2\n2\n\u03bd \u22124 (6)\n\u03b8eff (\u03bd) = \u03b8b2 (\u03bd) + \u03b8sc\n(\u03bd)\n= \u03b8b20 \u03bd \u22122 + \u03b8sc\n0\n\nis the effective resolution with the subscript \"0\" representing values at 1 GHz and the frequencies are in GHz\nunits. The effective resolution is the quadrature sum of\nthe resolution of the interferometer and the angular extent of Sgr A* caused by scattering.\n\u0001 The scaling for the\nsynthesized array beam \u03b8b \u221d \u03bd \u22121 assumes a fixed array\u0001\nconfiguration and the scattering diameter \u03b8sc \u221d \u03bd \u22122\nscales in conformance to measurements of Sgr A* and\nOH/IR masers (e.g., Frail et al. 1994). Our treatment\nassumes that scattered images are circular whereas in\nfact some are elliptical, but given that we are making\norder of magnitude estimates of pulsar numbers, the differences are not important.\nThe angular diameter of Sgr A* is dominated by interstellar scattering at low frequencies, with an observed\nmajor axis of \u03b8sc0 = 1.\u2032\u2032 2 (Bower et al. 2006). For the\nVLA in the A configuration and ignoring any effects of\nforeshortening, the half-power beam width is \u03b8b0 = 1.\u2032\u2032 95\n(Bridle 1989).\n\n7\n\nThe effective resolution of the VLA observations is then\n\u00011/2\n.\n(7)\n\u03b8eff (\u03bd) = 1.\u2032\u2032 2 \u03bd \u22122 1 + 2.6 \u03bd 2\n\nThe two contributions are equal at \u03bd = 0.6 GHz, so at\nfrequencies lower than this the resolution is completely\nscattering dominated and the resolution solid angle scales\nsteeply with frequency as \u03bd \u22124 .\nAdditionally, a single data point measured with the\nGMRT will be considered in our analysis, so a similar\neffective resolution must be constructed for this telescope. Roy & Rao (2004) measure the resolution to be\n11.\u2032\u2032 4 \u00d7 7.\u2032\u2032 6 at 620 MHz. Converting this ellipse to a circle of equal area and scaling to 1 GHz gives \u03b8b0 = 5.\u2032\u2032 77\nfor the GMRT. Combining this with scattering as above,\ngives\n\u00011/2\n.\n(8)\n\u03b8eff (\u03bd) = 1.\u2032\u2032 2 \u03bd \u22122 1 + 23.1 \u03bd 2\nFor the GMRT, the two components of the effective resolution are equal at \u03bd = 0.2 GHz.\n5.4. Candidate Pulsar Distributions\n\nWe choose three physically-motivated distributions as\nmodel pulsar populations. The distributions are illustrated below in Figure 2.\nThe first (Model A) assumes a constant number of pulsars per unit solid angle, dnp /d\u03a9 = constant, so the number of pulsars scales as\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u03a9eff (\u03bd)\nNA (\u03bd) = N1\n,\n(9)\n\u03a91\nwhere \u03a91 is the solid angle enclosing N1 pulsars. In\nthe fitting below, \u03a91 is set so that N1 gives the number of pulsars in the inner parsec. Referring to Equation 4, it may be seen that when scattering dominates\nthe effective resolution, the contribution to the unabsorbed spectrum from pulsars increases very rapidly as\nNA (\u03bd)\u03bd \u03b1psr \u221d \u03bd \u22125.7 . Free\u2013free absorption attenuates\nmuch of the flux, thus allowing a significant pulsar population to remain hidden in spectral measurements.\nIn Model B, we assume that dnp /d\u03a9 \u221d \u03a9\u22120.7 , corresponding to the surface density scaling observed for\nWolf-Rayet and O-star populations in the inner parsec\n(Genzel et al. 2010). This yields\n\u0014 0.3\n\u0015\n\u03a9eff (\u03bd)\nNB (\u03bd) = N1\n.\n(10)\n\u03a90.3\n1\nHowever, the observed populations of Wolf-Rayet and Ostars have an inner cutoff at \u03b8 \u2248 1\u2032\u2032 (Bartko et al. 2010).\nThis core may affect the pulsar population in many ways,\nbut we shall just consider two here. In both distributions,\nthe pulsar surface density goes as dnp /d\u03a9 \u221d \u03a9\u22120.7 outside the inner cutoff, as before. Inside the cutoff, one of\nthe distributions (call it Model B-1) has dnp /d\u03a9 = const\nand the other (call it Model B-2) has dnp /d\u03a9 = 0. These\nmodels give\n\u0015\n\uf8f1 \u0014 0.3\n\u03a9eff (\u03bd) \u2212 0.7\u03a90.3\n0\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n, \u03a9eff \u2265 \u03a90\n0.3\n\uf8f4 N1\n\uf8f2\n\u03a90.3\n1 \u2212 0.7\u03a90\n(11)\nNB1 (\u03bd) =\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\uf8f4\n0.7\n\uf8f4\n0.3\u03a9\n\u03a9\n\uf8f4\n0\n\uf8f3 N1\n\u03a9eff < \u03a90\n0.3\n\u03a90.3\n1 \u2212 0.7\u03a90\n\n\f8\nand\nNB2 (\u03bd) =\n\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f2\n\uf8f3\n\nN1\n0\n\n\u0014\n\n\u0015\n0.3\n\n\u03a90.3\neff (\u03bd) \u2212 \u03a90\n0.3\n\u03a90.3\n1 \u2212 \u03a90\n\n,\n\n\u03a9eff \u2265 \u03a90\n\n(12)\n\n\u03a9eff < \u03a90\n\npulsars enclosed within \u03a9eff .\nIn Model C, we consider a compact population of pulsars\ncontained in a solid angle much smaller than any resolution solid angle so that dnp /d\u03a9 is effectively a delta function. A compact distribution close to Sgr A* could conceivably arise as a product of dynamical friction (Morris\n1993; Miralda-Escud\u00e9 & Gould 2000). Here we simply\nhave\nNC (\u03bd) = N1 .\n\n(13)\n\nIn addition to the above three, one may consider other\nmodels for the pulsar distribution. For example, the pulsars could be arranged in a central core with a diffuse\nhalo. However, most of these other distributions can be\nmade as combinations of those we consider. As a result,\nwe do not expect the final answers to change by more\nthan an order of magnitude.\n\nwithin an angular distance of \u03b8 = 25\u2032\u2032 , which corresponds\nto a projected radial distance of r \u2248 1 pc from Sgr A*.\nThe allowed ranges for each parameter were chosen to be\nconsistent with current measurements and are presented\nbelow in Table 2. For reference, the best fit values for\nthe model with no pulsars present are \u03b1bh = 0.15 and\n\u03bdf = 0.26 GHz.\nFor each grid point in the three-dimensional parameter\nspace, we calculate \u03c72 between the measured flux and\nour model and evaluate the likelihood function assuming\nindependent Gaussian statistics for measurement errors,\n\nL(N1 , \u03b1bh , \u03bdf ) =\n\nNp\nY\n\ni=1\n\n\u0001\u2212 1\n2\u03c0\u03c3i2 2\n\n(\n\n[SSgr (\u03bdi ) \u2212 Sobs (\u03bdi )]\nexp \u2212\n2\u03c3i2\n\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1 2\n\u221d exp \u2212 \u03c7 .\n2\n\nTable 2\nSearched Parameters for Each Pulsar Distribution Model\n\nParameter Rangesa\nA\nB\nC\na\n\nN1\n\n\u03b1bh\n\n\u03bdf (GHz)\n\n[ 0, 50000, 100 ] [ 0.05, 0.40, 0.01 ] [ 0.05, 1.00, 0.01 ]\n[ 0, 50000, 100] [ 0.05, 0.40, 0.01 ] [ 0.05, 1.00, 0.01 ]\n[ 0, 5000, 10 ] [ 0.05, 0.40, 0.01 ] [ 0.05, 1.00, 0.01 ]\n\nData given as [ min, max, step size ]\n\nFigure 2. Pulsar number density as a function of angular separation from Sgr A* for each of the three distribution models. The\ndistributions have been normalized in this figure so that each model\nproduces the same number of pulsars enclosed within the inner parsec (\u03b8r \u2248 25\u2032\u2032 ). See Section 5.4 for a description of each model.\n\n5.5. Model Fitting\n\nTo test our distributions, we calculated the \u03c72 values of\nthe model given by Equation 4 with each of the three\ndistributions against the VLA and GMRT data from\nAn et al. (2005) and Falcke et al. (1998). We fix the pulsar spectral index at \u03b1psr = \u22121.7 and the flux density\nper pulsar at Spsr,\u03bd0 = 99 \u03bcJy at 1.4 GHz, as described\nin Section 5.2. The flux from the point source associated\nwith the MBH is normalized such that the total measured\nflux of Sgr A* exactly matches the data at 8.45 GHz. The\nspectral index of the MBH point source (\u03b1bh ), the number of pulsars (N1 ) and the free-free cutoff frequency (\u03bdf )\nare allowed to vary. The number of pulsars, N1 , is taken\n\n)\n\n(14)\n\nThe likelihood function is then marginalized over \u03b1bh\nand \u03bdf to get a distribution for N1 . The marginalized\nlikelihood functions for the number of pulsars within 1\npc of Sgr A* are plotted in Figure 3.\n\nModel\n\n2\n\nFigure 3. Likelihood functions for three pulsar distribution models (see Section 5.4 for a description of each model). The likelihoods\nhave been marginalized\nover the parameters \u03b1bh and \u03bdf and norR\nmalized so that L(N ) = 1. In each case, the pulsar spectral index\nwas taken to be \u03b1psr = \u22121.7.\n\n5.6. Results\n\nThe best-fit parameters for the maximum likelihood\n(ML) number of pulsars within the inner parsec of the\nGC for each model is provided in Table 3 and the resulting spectra are plotted in Figure 4. The number quoted\nin Table 3 is the ML number of pulsars as determined\nfrom the likelihood distribution and the uncertainties denote the most compact 68% confidence interval around\n\n\fConstraints on GC Pulsar Populations\nthe ML value. If the ML value for a distribution is zero,\nthen the upper limits are given at the 68% confidence\nlevel. In addition to the fiducial pulsar spectral index\nof \u03b1psr = \u22121.7, we include spectral indices of \u22121.0 and\n\u22122.5. For comparison, the best fit parameters for the\nmodel with the number of pulsars fixed at zero is also included in Table 3 and odds ratios are calculated against\nthis \"null\" model.\nIt is interesting to note that although Models A and B\ngive only upper limits to the pulsar population (of .103 \u2212\n104 ), Model C provides a non-zero maximum likelihood\nvalue of \u223c103 . Additionally, Model C provides a better\nfit than the model with no pulsars at all (the \"null\" model\nin Table 3).\nIn all of the models considered, an increase in the\nmaximum number of pulsars is accompanied by an increase in the free\u2013free turnover frequency. The increased\nfree-free absorption is required to mask the bright lowfrequency tail of a large pulsar population. Current estimates of free\u2013free absorption in the region near Sgr A*\ngive turnover frequencies around 330 MHz (Pedlar et al.\n1989). Estimates of the free\u2013free absorption of the flux\nfrom Sgr A*, however, assume a power-law flux density\nfor Sgr A* and would likely underestimate the absorption if a pulsar population were present. As a result,\nany independent measurement of the free-free absorption\nalong the line of sight of Sgr A* that does not assume a\nspectrum of the Sgr A* source could place an important\nconstraint on the pulsar population in the inner parsecs\nof the Galaxy.\nFrom current radio measurements of the inner parsec of\nthe GC, total pulsar populations (that is, both CPs and\nMSPs) of up to \u223c103 are consistent with observations,\nregardless of the underlying spatial distribution.\nTable 3\nNumber of Pulsars within 1 pc for Given Model and Spectral Index\n\nModel Parametersa\nModel\n\n\u03b1psr\n\nN1 (\u00d7103 )\n\n\u03b1bh\n\n\u03bdf (GHz)\n\nNdof\n\nA\n\n\u22121.0\n\u22121.7\n\u22122.5\n\n< 16.2\n< 7.4\n< 2.2\n\n0.14\n0.14\n0.14\n\n0.37\n0.38\n0.38\n\n10\n10\n10\n\n1.08 10\u22120.64\n1.16 10\u22121.05\n1.17 10\u22121.35\n\nB-0\n\n\u22121.0\n\u22121.7\n\u22122.5\n\n+2.5\n5.3\u22125.3\n< 4.9\n< 0.9\n\n0.17\n0.15\n0.13\n\n0.45\n0.53\n0.47\n\n10\n10\n10\n\n0.79 10\u22120.55\n1.07 10\u22121.21\n1.27 10\u22121.42\n\nB-1\n\n\u22121.0\n\u22121.7\n\u22122.5\n\n< 3.8\n< 1.5\n< 0.4\n\n0.14\n0.13\n0.14\n\n0.40\n0.41\n0.38\n\n10\n10\n10\n\n1.06 10\u22120.85\n1.14 10\u22121.03\n1.17 10\u22121.22\n\nB-2\n\n\u22121.0\n\u22121.7\n\u22122.5\n\n< 2.4\n< 1.2\n< 0.4\n\n0.14\n0.14\n0.14\n\n0.36\n0.38\n0.38\n\n10\n10\n10\n\n1.07 10\u22121.02\n1.13 10\u22121.00\n1.17 10\u22121.23\n\nC\n\n\u22121.0\n\u22121.7\n\u22122.5\n\n+0.5\n1.4\u22120.7\n1.1 \u00b1 0.4\n+0.4\n1.1\u22120.6\n\n0.25\n0.21\n0.17\n\n0.40\n0.47\n0.58\n\n10\n10\n10\n\n0.55 10+0.28\n0.59 10+0.12\n0.75 10\u22120.46\n\nNullb\n\n...\n\n0\n\n0.15\n\n0.26\n\n11\n\n0.81\n\na\n\nb\n\n\u03c72r\n\nOdds\n\n1.0\n\nBest fit model parameters for maximum likelihood (ML) number of pulsars.\nIf the ML number of pulsars is zero, then the 68% confidence upper limit is\nused and reported with a \"<\".\nThe \"Null\" case fixes the number of pulsars at zero.\n\n9\n\nFigure 4. Top: Fit curves for model pulsar distributions to the\nVLA (squares) and GMRT (diamond) data from An et al. (2005)\nand VLA (filled circles) data from Falcke et al. (1998).

The total unabsorbed flux is also\nshown for comparison.\n\n6. DIFFUSE GAMMA-RAY EMISSION AND MSPS\n\nMSPs are known gamma-ray sources (Abdo et al.\n2009a). As a result, we may set constraints on the MSP\npopulation in the GC by measuring the diffuse gammaray emission from the GC. In a recent analysis of the\nfirst two years of data from the Fermi Gamma-Ray Space\nTelescope, Hooper & Goodenough (2011, herafter, HG)\nobserved an excess of gamma-ray flux toward the inner 1\u25e6\n(150 pc) of the GC, with a significant excess within 0.25\u25e6\n(\u2248 40 pc). HG argued that the signal is consistent with\nthe annihilation of 7\u201310 GeV dark matter particles with\na cusped halo distribution around Sgr A* and difficult\nto explain using known astrophysical sources. Abazajian\n(2011), however, claimed that while the spectrum may be\ninconsistent with the average pulsar spectrum, it is consistent with some pulsar spectra and therefore could be\nexplained by astrophysical sources. HG provide a spec-\n\n\f10\ntrum for the gamma-ray excess in the GC of the form\ndN\u03b3\n\u221d E \u2212\u0393 exp (\u2212E/Ecut )\ndE\n\n(15)\n\n+0.21\nwhere \u0393 = 0.99+0.10\n\u22120.09 and Ecut = 1.92\u22120.17 GeV. These\nparameter values are consistent (to current uncertainties) with the spectra of 16 out of 46 pulsars in the first\nFermi LAT catalog of gamma-ray pulsars (Abdo et al.\n2010b). We proceed assuming that the observed excess\nseen by HG is real (however, see Boyarsky et al. 2011),\nfollows the spectrum fit by HG and is entirely caused by\na collection of MSPs in the GC.\nThe spectrum is normalized so that E 2 dN\u03b3 /dE \u2248\n10\u22127 GeV cm\u22122 s\u22121 at E = 1.0 GeV based on the HG\nplots, giving\n\u0013\u22120.99\n\u0012\nE\ndN\u03b3\n\u22121\n\u22127\n\u22122 \u22121\n= 1.7 \u00d7 10 GeV cm s\ndE\n1 GeV\n\u0013\n\u0012\nE\n.\n(16)\n\u00d7 exp \u2212\n1.92 GeV\n\nCalculating the integrated energy flux from the above\nspectrum over 0.1\u2013100 GeV as\nZ 100 GeV\ndN\u03b3\nS\u03b3 =\nE\ndE\n(17)\ndE\n0.1 GeV\n2\n\nand letting L\u03b3 = 4\u03c0d f\u03a9 S\u03b3 , we find that the gammaray luminosity of a source at the GC is L\u03b3 \u2248 4 \u00d7\n1036 erg s\u22121 f\u03a9 . The correction factor, f\u03a9 , is similar to\nthe beaming fraction in radio pulsars and is generally\ntaken to be unity in most modern models (Watters et al.\n2009).\nFollowing calculations made to estimate the number of\nMSPs in globular clusters (Abdo et al. 2010a), we can\nestimate the MSP population of the GC as\nNMSP =\n\nL\u03b3\nh\u0116ih\u03b7\u03b3 i\n\n(18)\n\nwhere \u0116 is the total spindown luminosity of a MSP,\n\u03b7\u03b3 = L\u03b3 /\u0116 is the \"efficiency\" of converting spin-down\npower into gamma-rays, and angled brackets denote an\naverage over the population. The values of h\u0116i and h\u03b7\u03b3 i\nare taken from the local (d < 1 kpc) MSP population\nto avoid selection effects. The mean spin-down luminosity is taken to be h\u0116i = 1.1 \u00d7 1034 erg s\u22121 from the 27\nMSPs within 1 kpc of Earth listed in the ATNF catalog (Manchester et al. 2005). Since h\u03b7\u03b3 i \u221d L\u03b3 \u221d d2 ,\nthe uncertainties in h\u03b7\u03b3 i are dominated by distance uncertainties and values range from h\u03b7\u03b3 i = 10\u22123 \u2212 1 in\nthe first Fermi gamma-ray pulsar catalog (Abdo et al.\n2010b). To mitigate this distance problem, we take only\nthose seven nearby pulsars in the catalog for which distances could be measured accurately with parallax. For\nthese pulsars, we find h\u03b7\u03b3 i = 0.08 \u00b1 0.04. Using Equation 18, we get an estimate of NMSP \u2248 5000. In order to\ncontribute the observed excess, these pulsars would be\nlocated within 1\u25e6 (150 pc) of Sgr A*, with the highest\nconcentration within 0.25\u25e6 (40 pc).\nOur estimate for the number of MSPs in the GC is\nessentially an upper bound for the population. How-\n\never, modeling the background component of the diffuse\ngamma-ray emission in the GC is still somewhat uncertain (Abdo et al. 2009b) and, as a result of this uncertainty, our estimate can only be taken as an approximate\nupper limit. Additionally, as this is a measure of the\nexcess gamma-ray flux in the region (with the Galactic\nplane and a central point source coincident with Sgr A*\nsubtracted), there exists the possiblity that a signicant\nnumber of MSPs are unaccounted for in this estimate.\nAssuming the HG gamma-ray excess in the GC is real\nand does not suffer from systematic errors in background\nsubtraction, we see that it is not inconsistent with a centrally concentrated population of \u223c103 MSPs in the inner\ntens of parsecs from Sgr A*.\nFinally, we note that similar estimates for the MSP population in the GC have been made in the past. Wang et al.\n(2005) used a model proposed by Zhang & Cheng (1997)\nto predict the emission of gamma-rays from MSPs as a\nfunction of global pulsar parameters like spin period and\npolar magnetic field. They used Monte Carlo methods\nto simulate a population of pulsars and measured the total gamma-ray luminosity. Comparing this luminosity to\nmeasured values from EGRET, Wang et al. (2005) estimated a GC MSP population of NMSP \u2248 6000 in the\nEGRET field (r \u2248 1.5\u25e6 , 220 pc).\n7. MASSIVE STARS IN THE GALACTIC CENTER\n\nThe central parsec of the GC is one of the most active\nmassive star formation regions in the Milky Way and\nis currently known to contain about 200 young massive\nstars (Genzel et al. 2010). As massive stars are the progenitors of neutron stars (NSs), we may use current stellar populations to estimate the number of pulsars in this\nregion.\nThe inner parsec stellar population is divided into three\nfairly distinct regions. The innermost region (R \u2264 1\u2032\u2032 ) is\nthe so-called \"S-star Cluster\" of main sequence B-stars.\nThese stars can be fitted with a standard Salpeter initial\nmass function (IMF) for a single star formation event or\nfor a continuous star-forming population with ages of a\nfew Myr to 60 Myr (Bartko et al. 2010). Outside this region (1\u2032\u2032 \u2264 R \u2264 12\u2032\u2032 ), the stars are largely arranged in at\nleast one disk (possibly two) of mass M \u223c 104 M\u2299 with a\ntop-heavy IMF of dN/dm \u221d m\u22120.45 (Bartko et al. 2010).\nThe early-type stars in this region appear to have been\nformed in a starburst \u223c6 Myr ago. Outside the disk region (R \u2265 12\u2032\u2032 ) the stellar population is again consistent\nwith a Salpeter IMF.\nFollowing similar calculations by Lazio & Cordes (2008)\nand Faucher-Gigu\u00e8re & Loeb (2011), the current stellar\npopulations can be used to estimate the number of radio pulsars harbored in the central parsec. The number\nof active CPs and MSPs beamed toward Earth are estimated to be\nNCP = fpsr fb f\u03c4 fv Nns\n\n(19)\n\nNMSP = fpsr fb f\u03c4 fv fr Nns ,\n\n(20)\n\nand\n\nrespectively, where Nns is the number of NSs in the inner\nparsec, fpsr is the fraction of NSs that form pulsars, fb =\n0.2 is the beaming fraction, f\u03c4 is the fraction of pulsars\n\n\fConstraints on GC Pulsar Populations\nwith ages less than the typical pulsar radio lifetime, fv is\nthe fraction of pulsars with birth velocities small enough\nto be retained in the inner parsec and fr is the fraction\nof NSs that are recycled into MSPs. The fraction of\nNSs that form pulsars is taken to be fpsr \u223c 1, although\nthis factor is still fairly uncertain (Lazio & Cordes 2008).\nThe terms Nns , f\u03c4 , fv and fr are discussed below.\n7.1. Neutron Star Population in the Inner Parsec (Nns )\n\nThe total number of NSs residing in the inner parsec\nmay be estimated from current observations of the massive star population. Velocity measurements of stars allow for the total dynamical mass enclosed within a few\nparsecs of Sgr A* to be determined. Subtracting the\nmass of the MBH gives an extended mass of \u223c106 M\u2299\nin stars within a parsec of Sgr A* (Genzel et al. 1996;\nSch\u00f6del et al. 2009). With the total mass of stars established, the number of NSs can be calculated for a given\ninitial mass function (IMF) and mass range of stars that\nend their lives as NSs.\nA typical NS progenitor mass range is 9M\u2299 < M <\n25M\u2299 (Heger et al. 2003). However, such ranges are theoretically determined for only isolated non-rotating stars\nand rely on mass-loss and stellar wind models that are\npoorly constrained by observations (Heger et al. 2003).\nIf very massive stars have higher mass-loss rates than\nmodeled, then NSs could form from stars with initial\nmasses above & 25M\u2299 . That this may be the case is\nsupported by the limited observational constraints. For\nexample, Muno et al. (2006) detected an X-ray pulsar in\nthe young Galactic cluster Westerlund 1 that requires a\nprogenitor mass of M > 40M\u2299 to have formed in the age\nof the cluster.\nTo calculate the number of NSs produced by the GC\nmassive star population, we consider IMFs of the form\ndN/dm \u221d m\u2212\u03b1 over a range of masses from 0.1M\u2299\nto 100M\u2299. For the case of the standard Salpeter IMF\n(\u03b1 = 2.35) observed in most of the inner parsec and\na progenitor mass range of 9M\u2299 < M < 25M\u2299 , a total of Nns \u2248 4900 NSs are produced. If the top-heavy\nIMF (\u03b1 = 0.45) observed in the young disks is taken to\nhold for the whole central parsec, a total of Nns \u2248 5700\nare produced. If a wider range of progenitor masses is\ntaken, say 9M\u2299 < M < 40M\u2299 to allow the Muno et al.\n(2006) observation, the total NS populations increase to\nNns \u2248 5700 and Nns \u2248 9500 for the Salpeter and topheavy IMFs, respectively. Even given a wide range in\nIMF and progenitor mass, the above results are consistent to an order of magnitude with a NS population of\nNns \u223c 104 . In terms of NSs formed per stellar mass, we\n\u22121\nfind a value of \u03b2ns \u223c 10\u22122 M\u2299\nfor the \u223c106 M\u2299 worth\nof stars within a parsec of Sgr A*.\n\n11\n\nbe f\u03c4 \u223c \u03c4 /tsf , where tsf is the amount of time elapsed\nsince the star formation began.\n7.3. Fraction of Pulsars Retained (fv )\n\nFrom the high observed velocities (\u223c102 \u2212103 km s\u22121 ) of\nsome pulsars, it has been inferred that NSs are given a\nlarge \"kick\" velocity at birth as a result of binary disassociation or an asymmetric supernova explosion (or\nboth). A pulsar created in the inner parsec will be retained in the inner parsec only if its birth velocity does\nnot exceed the local escape velocity of its orbit around\nSgr A*. Assuming only the influence of a MBH of mass\nM \u2248 4 \u00d7 106 M\u2299 , the escape velocity at a distance r\nfrom Sgr A* is given by\n\nve (r) = 185 km s\u22121\n\n\u0012\n\nM\n4 \u00d7 106 M\u2299\n\n\u00131/2 \u0012\n\nr\n1 pc\n\n\u0013\u22121/2\n\n.\n\n(21)\nAssuming a Maxwellian distribution of birth velocities with a mean of hvbirth i = 380 km s\u22121\n(Faucher-Gigu\u00e8re & Kaspi 2006), we find retention fractions of fv \u2248 0.1 and fv \u2248 0.25 for radial distances of\nr = 1 pc and r = 0.5 pc, respectively. However, the actual shape of the pulsar birth velocity distribution is not\nwell constrained and one may worry that the Maxwellian\ndistribution is arbitrary. In an analysis of pulsar velocities, Faucher-Gigu\u00e8re & Kaspi (2006) consider six different pulsar velocity distributions. Repeating our calculation for each distribution, we find retention fractions\nin the ranges of fv \u2248 0.05 \u2212 0.4 and fv \u2248 0.1 \u2212 0.5 for\ndistances of r = 1 pc and r = 0.5 pc, respectively.\nIf no other effects are important, we would expect a retention fraction of fv & 0.1. However, a similar analysis to the one performed above would underestimate the\nretained NS populations in globular clusters by orders\nof magnitude. Observations of pulsars and low-mass Xray binaries (LMXBs) suggest that up to \u223c10% of all\nNSs formed in some globular clusters may be retained\n(Pfahl et al. 2002). However, current models for isolated\npulsars predict that . 1% of NSs will have birth velocities below the . 50 km s\u22121 globular cluster escape\nvelocities. This \"retention problem\" is currently an unsolved problem, but likely has to do with the high stellar\ndensities and binary fractions found in the cores of globular clusters (see Pfahl et al. 2002, and references within).\nSince the GC has even higher stellar densities than cores\nof globular clusters, we expect a similar heightening of\nthe retention fraction and thus adopt as a nominal value\nfv \u223c 1.\n7.4. Fraction of Pulsars Recycled to MSPs (fr )\n\n7.2. Fraction of Still-Active Pulsars (f\u03c4 )\n\nThe typical lifetimes over which pulsars maintain active radio emission are \u03c4 \u223c 107 yr for CPs and \u03c4 \u223c\n109 \u2212 1010 yr for MSPs. As a result, the fraction of\npulsars formed recently enough to still be active must\nbe considered in estimates of the observable population.\nThis factor will depend on the star formation history\n(SFH) of the region. In the case of continuous star formation, the active fraction of pulsars can be estimated to\n\nMSPs are thought to be formed when a NS in a binary\ngains angular momentum through accretion of matter\nin a process known as \"recycling\" (Alpar et al. 1982;\nBhattacharya & van den Heuvel 1991). Thus, the fraction of NSs recycled into MSPs must be determined to estimate the MSP population. Within 3 kpc of the Sun, the\nbirthrate of pulsars with 400 MHz pseudo-luminosities\nabove 1 mJy kpc2 is observed to be \u223c10\u22123 yr\u22121 and\n&10\u22126 yr\u22121 for CPs and MSPs, respectively (Lyne et al.\n\n\f12\n1998). Using these birthrates, we may infer that the recycling fraction is at least fr & 10\u22123 in the Galactic disk.\nThe increased stellar density and stellar encounter rate\nin the GC will very likely increase this fraction. LMXBs,\nthe assumed progenitors of MSPs, have been found to\nbe \u223c100 times more abundant in globular clusters than\nthe general Galactic field (Clark 1975; Katz 1975). As\nthe central parsec of the GC has a higher stellar density\nthan globular clusters, we would expect at least a similar overabundance of LMXBs and their resultant MSPs\nas is seen in globular clusters. As a result, we adopt a\nrecycling fraction of fr \u223c 0.1.\n\nFrom Equation 19, the CP contribution from the disk is\nfound to be\n!\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0013\n\u0012\nMdisk\n\u03b2ns\nfv\ndisk\n. (24)\nNCP \u223c 20\n\u22121\n1.0\n104 M\u2299\n0.01 M\u2299\n\n7.5. Pulsar Estimates for Various Star Formation\n\nThe SFH has also been estimated by comparing simulated populations with the observed cool giant stars in\nthe central parsec. Such simulations allow the average\nstar formation rate to be calculated as a function of\nlook-back time for a few coarse time bins. In two separate analyses, both Blum et al. (2003) and Pfuhl et al.\n(2011) found that &80% of the stellar mass in the central parsec was formed &5 Gyr ago and that there has\nbeen increased star formation in the last \u223c100 Myr. In\ntheir best fit models, Blum et al. (2003) found an average star formation rate of \u223c3 \u00d7 10\u22123M\u2299 yr\u22121 within 2 pc\nof Sgr A* from 10 to 100 Myr ago and Pfuhl et al. (2011)\nfound an average star formation rate of \u223c10\u22123 M\u2299 yr\u22121\nwithin 1 pc of Sgr A* from 50 to 200 Myr ago. Both cases\nare consistent with \u223c105 M\u2299 worth of stars being formed\nin the inner parsec of the GC in the last \u223c100 Myr.\nIf there has been continuous star formation in the last\n\u223c100 Myr, then the fraction of still active CPs would\nbe f\u03c4 \u223c 0.1. Taking all other parameters as before, the\ncontinuous formation of \u223c105 M\u2299 worth of stars over the\nlast \u223c108 yr would produce\n!\n\u0001!\n\u0013\n\u0012\n8\nM\nt\n<\n10\nyr\n\u03b2\nf\nns\nv\ncon\n(25)\n.\nNCP\n\u223c 20\n\u22121\n1.0\n105 M\u2299\n0.01 M\u2299\n\nHistories\nAs the star formation history (SFH) of the central parsec of the GC is still somewhat uncertain, we will consider two general SFHs suggested by current observations. In the first case, we take the massive-star disk(s)\nto have formed in a well-defined starburst \u223c6 Myr ago\n(Paumard et al. 2006; Bartko et al. 2010) and assume\nthat the rest of the central parsec has experienced continuous star formation over the age of the Galaxy. In\nthe second case, we consider SFHs based on spectrophotometry of cool giant stars which indicate that most\nof the stars in the inner parsec were formed & 5 Gyr ago\nbut also show an increased star formation rate in the last\n\u223c100 Myr (Blum et al. 2003; Pfuhl et al. 2011).\n7.5.1. Continuous Star Formation + Disk Starburst\n\nIn the first SFH, pulsars can come from both the general\npopulation of stars in the central parsec and the young\ndisk population. For the general population, we take the\ntotal mass of stars to be M \u223c 106 M\u2299 and assume continuous star formation over the last \u223c1010 yr. From the\nparameters discussed above, the total number\nof NSs is\n\u0001\n.\nTaking\na CP\nfound to be Nns \u223c 104 \u03b2ns /10\u22122M\u22121\n\u2299\nactive radio lifetime of \u03c4 \u223c 107 yr, continuous star formation over \u223c1010 yr will give the fraction of CPs still\nactive to be f\u03c4 \u223c 10\u22123 . From Equation 19, the CP contribution from the continuous star forming region of the\ninner parsec is\n!\u0012\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0013\nfv\n\u03b2ns\nM\ngen\nNCP \u223c 2\n. (22)\n1.0\n106 M\u2299\n0.01 M\u22121\n\u2299\n10\n\nFor MSPs with a radio lifetime of \u223c10 yr, the fraction\nstill active is f\u03c4 \u223c 1. Adopting the recycling fraction\nof fr \u223c 0.1 discussed above, the contribution of MSPs\nfrom the general population of the inner parsec is given\nby Equation 20 as\n!\u0012\n\u0013\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0013\n\u0012\nM\n\u03b2ns\nfr\nfv\ngen\n(23)\n.\nNMSP\u223c200\n1.0\n0.1\n106 M\u2299\n0.01 M\u22121\n\u2299\nAdditionally, the contribution of pulsars from the\nmassive-star disk(s) must be considered. The disk is assumed to have a population of stars formed in a starburst\nevent \u223c6\u00d7106 yr ago with a total stellar mass of \u223c104 M\u2299\n(Paumard et al. 2006; Bartko et al. 2010). Since the age\nof the disk is comparable to the active radio lifetime of a\nCP, the fraction of CPs still active is taken to be f\u03c4 \u223c 1.\n\nThe disk population is not expected to produce any\ncurrently observable MSPs as the short timescale of\n\u223c6\u00d7106 yr provides insufficient time to create and evolve\na NS population into MSPs. As a result, this first SFH\nproduces roughly NCP \u223c 20 CPs and NMSP \u223c 200 MSPs.\n7.5.2. SFH from Observations of Cool Giant Stars\n\nIf the recent star formation all took place in the last\n\u223c107 yr, then the fraction of CPs still active would be\nf\u03c4 \u223c 1. In this case, the number of active CPs would be\n!\n\u0001!\n\u0012 \u0013\nM t < 108 yr\n\u03b2ns\nfv\nburst\nNCP \u223c200\n(26)\n.\n1.0\n105 M\u2299\n0.01 M\u22121\n\u2299\nIn either of the above cases, the majority (&90%) of the\nstar formation took place at look-back times &108 yr\nago. As a result, the number of MSPs produced will\nbe approximately the same as the first SFH considered,\nnamely NMSP \u223c 200.\n7.5.3. Upper Limits to the Pulsar Population\n\nUsing the above estimates of CP and MSP populations\nfor a range of observationally supported SFHs, upper limits may be set on the total allowable number of pulsars in\nthe inner parsec. For CPs, the most favorable formation\nscenarios produce NCP \u223c 200. For MSPs, a variety of\nSFHs consistently produce NMSP \u223c 200 (fr /0.1). Since\nthe recycling fraction is unknown for the extreme conditions of the inner GC, an upper limit of NMSP \u223c 2000\nmay be set by adopting fr \u223c 1. Thus, observations\nof current stellar populations place an upper limit of\n\n\fConstraints on GC Pulsar Populations\na few\u00d7103 on the number of active radio pulsars beamed\ntoward Earth in the inner parsec of the GC.\n8. PULSAR WIND NEBULAE IN INNER 20 PC\n\nUsing a total of 1 Ms of Chandra ACIS\u2013I observations of\nthe inner parsecs of the GC, Muno et al. (2008) compiled\na catalog of 34 diffuse X-ray emitting features. Based on\nthe X-ray luminosities and sizes of the sources in their\ncatalog, Muno et al. (2008) expect \u223c20 pulsar wind nebulae (PWNe) to be present within 20 pc of Sgr A*. Since\nPWNe are powered by pulsars, we may use this inferred\npopulation of PWNe to estimate the pulsar population\nin the inner 20 pc of the GC.\nPulsars can lose their rotational kinetic energy by the\nrelease of relativistic winds of charged particles. The\nwinds exert a pressure upon and deposit energy into\nthe surrounding interstellar medium, producing luminous PWNe that radiate across the electromagnetic spectrum (see, e.g., Gaensler & Slane 2006). As a result, the\nluminosity of the PWN will be directly related to the\nspin-down luminosity of the pulsar given by\n\u0116 = \u2212dErot /dt = 4\u03c0 2 I \u1e56 /P 3 ,\n\n(27)\n\nwhere I and P are the moment of inertia and period,\nrespectively, of the pulsar.\nSince the spin-down luminosity of a pulsar decreases\nwith increasing age, one would expect the most luminous\nPWNe to contain young pulsars (however, older pulsars\nmay be \"recycled\" sufficiently to power PWNe as described by Cheng et al. 2006). Of the 30 confirmed pulsars associated with PWNe, 25 have characteristic ages\n(\u03c4c = P/2\u1e56 ) of \u03c4c . 106 yr and 23 have characteristic ages \u03c4c . 105 yr (Roberts 2004). Thus, we adopt a\nlifetime for a typical PWN of tpwn \u223c 105 yr.\nGiven the observed number of PWNe in the GC (Nobs \u223c\n20) and a typical lifetime of tpwn \u223c 105 yr, we find a\nmean rate of formation of PWNe over the last \u223c105 yr\nto be\n\u0012\n\u0013\u0012\n\u0013\u22121\nNpwn\ntpwn\n\u03b2pwn \u223c 2 \u00d7 10\u22124 yr\u22121\n. (28)\n20\n105 yr\nAssuming that the PWN formation rate has remained\nconstant over the last \u223c107 yr, we may estimate the number of CPs in the inner 20 pc to be\n\u22121\nNCP \u223c \u03b2pwn \u03c4psr fb fv fpwn\n,\n\n(29)\n\nwhere \u03c4psr \u223c 107 yr is the typical radio lifetime of a CP,\nfb = 0.2 is the beaming fraction, fv is the fraction of\npulsars with birth velocities low enough to be retained\nin the inner 20 pc, and fpwn \u223c 1 is the fraction of pulsars\nthat form PWNe.\nTaking the mass of the central 20 pc to be M = 3 \u00d7\n107 M\u2299 (Lindqvist et al. 1992), we find that pulsars must\nhave velocities vbirth < 115 km s\u22121 to remain gravitationally bound to the inner 20 pc. From the birth velocity distributions considered by Faucher-Gigu\u00e8re & Kaspi\n(2006), we find fv \u2248 0.05 \u2212 0.30. However, the distance\ntraveled by a pulsar is given by\n\u0013\n\u0013\u0012\n\u0012\nt\nv\n.\n(30)\nd \u2248 10 pc\n105 yr\n100 km s\u22121\n\n13\n\nThus, pulsars with velocities high enough to become\ngravitationally unbound will also have velocities high\nenough to escape the inner 20 pc on timescales comparable to the PWN lifetime. As a result, the PWNe\nobserved within the inner 20 pc are very likely to remain\nthere and we can take fv \u223c 1.\nFrom Equation 29, we see that if the PWN birth rate has\nbeen constant over the last \u223c107 yr, we would expect\n\u0013\u0012\n\u0013\u22121 \u0012\n\u0013\u22121\n\u0012\ntpwn\nfpwn\nNpwn\n(31)\nNCP \u223c 400\n20\n105 yr\n1.0\nCPs within 20 pc of Sgr A*.\nFinally, we note that of the \u223c20 PWN candidates identified by Muno et al. (2008), 4 fall within a projected radial distance of 1 pc from Sgr A*. Assuming the number\nof pulsars scales accordingly, then Equation 31 predicts\nNCP \u223c 80 CPs within the inner parsec of the GC.\n9. SUPERNOVA RATE IN THE GALACTIC CENTER\n\nNeutron stars are formed as the end products of corecollapse supernovae (CCSN). An estimate of the rate of\nCCSN in the GC would therefore offer a constraint on the\npulsar population. The CCSN rate is estimated below for\nboth r < 150 pc and r < 20 pc.\n9.1. CCSN Rate Within r < 150 pc of Sgr A*\n\nBy measuring the total mass of 26 Al in the Galaxy,\nDiehl et al. (2006) estimate the Galactic CCSN rate to\nbe \u03b2CCSN = 1.9 \u00b1 1.1 century\u22121 . One may, in principle, scale this estimate to smaller regions of the Galaxy\nusing massive star populations. Taking the inner 500\npc to contain 10% of the Galaxy's massive star formation (Figer 2008) we can estimate that the inner \u223c150 pc\ncontains \u223c2% of the massive star formation and therefore\nshould have a CCSN rate of \u03b2CCSN \u2248 0.04 century\u22121 .\nCrocker et al. (2011) estimate a similar rate and show\nthat it is consistent with SN rate estimates from infrared observations, stellar composition, X-ray emission,\ngas turbulence, and high-velocity compact clouds (see\nCrocker et al. 2011, and references within). We may now\nestimate the CP population in the GC to be\nNCP = fpsr fb fv \u03c4psr \u03b2CCSN\n\n(32)\n\nwhere \u03b2CCSN \u2248 4 \u00d7 10\u22124 yr\u22121 is the CCSN rate, \u03c4psr \u223c\n107 yr is the mean canonical pulsar lifetime, fb = 0.2\nis the fraction of pulsars beamed toward Earth, fv is\nthe fraction of pulsars with birth velocities small enough\nto be retained by the GC and fpsr \u223c 1 is the fraction of CCSN that result in active pulsars. Using the\ndistributions from Faucher-Gigu\u00e8re & Kaspi (2006), the\nfraction of pulsars with birth velocities smaller than\nthe escape velocity ve \u2248 200 km s\u22121 at 150 pc ranges\nfrom fv \u2248 0.1 \u2212 0.4. These values give an estimate of\nNCP \u223c 100. Likewise, accounting for the longer ages for\nMSPs (\u03c4psr \u223c 1010 yr), we can estimate the MSP population to be NMSP \u223c 105 fr , where fr is the fraction of\nNSs that get recycled to MSPs (see Section 7.4).\n9.2. CCSN Rate in Inner 20 pc from X-ray\n\nObservations\n\n\f14\nStudies of diffuse X-ray emission can also provide insight into the SN rate in the GC. Using over 600 ks of\nChandra ACIS\u2013I observations, Muno et al. (2004) found\nthat the diffuse X-ray emissions in the GC could be\nexplained by a two-temperature plasma composed of a\n\"soft\" component (kT \u2248 0.8 keV) and a \"hard\" component (kT \u2248 8 keV). Assuming the soft component of\nthe plasma is primarily heated by SNe, an estimate for\nthe SN rate can be made by observing the loss of energy\nfrom the inner 20 pc.\nLet us first consider the case in which the soft component\nof the plasma just cools radiatively. The X-ray luminosity of the soft component of the plasma in the inner 20 pc\nis LX \u2248 3 \u00d7 1036 erg s\u22121 (Muno et al. 2004). If each SN\ntransfers \u223c1% of its total kinetic energy of \u223c1051 erg\nto the plasma, then a SN rate of \u03b2SN \u2248 10\u22125 yr\u22121\nis required to maintain the currently observed temperature. Taking this rate to be constant and fv \u223c 0.1 (see\nSection 8) gives an estimate for the CP population of\nNCP \u223c 2 (fv /0.1).\nIf the plasma is unconfined, it can also cool through adiabatic expansion. Rough estimates put this cooling rate at\nLad \u2248 9 \u00d7 1038 erg s\u22121 (Muno et al. 2004), which would\nrequire a SN rate of \u03b2SN \u2248 3 \u00d7 10\u22123 yr\u22121 . Again assuming this rate is constant and fv \u223c 0.1 as above, the\nestimated CP population is NCP \u223c 600 (fv /0.1).\nThe above estimates assume that the SN rate is constant over the radio lifetime of a CP (\u223c107 yr). However, the SN rate estimates are only required to hold\nover a characteristic cooling time of tc \u223c E/L, where\nE \u223c 5 \u00d7 1050 erg s\u22121 is the total thermal energy stored\nin the plasma and L is the appropriate cooling luminosity (Muno et al. 2004). The cooling timescales for radiative cooling and adiabatic expansion are 5 \u00d7 106 yr and\n2 \u00d7 104 yr, respectively.\nKeeping this caveat in mind, the assumption of a constant SN rate does allow useful bounds to be put on the\npulsar populations in the GC. Taking a constant SN rate\nfrom radiative cooling to be a lower bound and a constant SN rate from adiabatic expansion to be an upper\nbound, we find the CP population in the inner 20 pc to be\n1 . NCP . 103 . Likewise, for MSPs with \u03c4 \u223c 1010 yr,\nwe estimate a population of 103 fr . NMSP . 106 fr ,\nwhere fr is the fraction of NSs recycled into MSPs (see\nSection 7.4).\n10. DISCUSSION\n10.1. Summary of Estimates\n\nWe have used observations over a wide range of wavelengths to make order of magnitude estimates of the number of pulsars allowed within r \u2264 1 pc and r \u2264 150 pc of\nSgr A*. The estimates are summarized in Table 4.\n10.1.1. Pulsar Population Within r \u2264 150 pc\n\nLimits on the pulsar population within 150 pc of Sgr A*\nmay be set using the five known pulsars in the inner 15\u2032 ,\nthe catalog of compact radio sources by Lazio & Cordes\n(2008), measurements of an excess gamma-ray flux\nby Hooper & Goodenough (2011) and estimates of the\nGalactic core-collapse supernova rate.\nThe five known pulsars in the inner 15\u2032 provide the\n\nstrongest current evidence for an intrinsic pulsar population in the GC region. A Monte Carlo population\nanalysis by Deneva et al. (2009) showed that the pulsar\ndetections in the survey by Deneva et al. (2009) indicate\na population of at least N & 100 pulsars within 100 pc\nof Sgr A*.\nThe catalog of compact radio sources compiled by\nLazio & Cordes (2008) allows for upper limits to be\nplaced on the pulsar population in the inner 150 pc.\nThe VLA survey produced a total of 170 compact steepspectrum sources. Although pulsars cannot be unequivocally classified in an imaging survey, Lazio & Cordes\n(2008) estimate that N \u223c 10 of the sources were likely\npulsars. Using this estimate and the survey sensitivities,\na conservative upper bound of N . 104 may be set on\nthe pulsar population in this region. Even if it turns\nout that there are no pulsars in the catalog, an upper\nlimit of N . 103 may be set to 99% confidence level. We\nnote that although these upper limits should hold for the\nentire survey region, the increasing background temperature and sidelobes caused by extended emission toward\nthe inner GC mean that the inner field of the survey\n(half-power radius of 15\u2032 ) likely experienced decreased\nsensitivity and could potentially hide a significant pulsar\npopulation in the immediate vicinity of Sgr A*.\nUsing the first two years of Fermi data,\nHooper & Goodenough (2011) claim to have detected\nan excess diffuse gamma-ray flux in the inner 150 pc\nof the Galaxy, which they attribute to annihilating\ndark matter particles. If we assume the gamma-rays\ncome instead from a collection of MSPs, an upper\nlimit to the number of MSPs in the GC may be set.\nFollowing similar calculations for globular clusters by\nAbdo et al. (2010a), we find that the excess is consistent\nwith a population of \u223c5 \u00d7 103 MSPs. This estimate is\nnominally an upper limit, but considering the systematic\nuncertainties in current GC gamma-ray background\nmodels and difficulties subtracting the point source\nassociated with Sgr A*, we adopt this value as only a\nlower limit on the upper bound of MSPs in the inner\n150 pc.\nAs radio pulsars are formed in core-collapse SNe, the\nSN rate also provides a constraint on the pulsar population in the GC. By scaling down the Galactic SN rate\nbased on massive star populations in a manner similar\nto that of Crocker et al. (2011), we estimate a SN of\n\u03b2CCSN \u2248 0.04 century\u22121 . Such a SN rate indicates a\nCP population of NCP \u223c 100 and an MSP population\nof NMSP \u223c 105 fr , where fr is the recycling fraction discussed in Section 7.2. Since the recycling fraction of field\npulsars is fr & 10\u22123 and potentially as high as fr \u223c 0.1 in\nglobular clusters, we adopt a nominal value of fr \u223c 10\u22122 ,\nso NMSP \u223c 103 (fr /10\u22122 ).\nFinally, we note that all of the upper limits considered for pulsar populations on the large scale of 150 pc\nmay not include contributions from the few inner parsecs as a result of decreased sensitivity or failure to\nincorporate recent starburst activity. As a result, we\nconsider these limits mainly applicable in the region\n1 pc . r . 150 pc. The above estimates are consistent with a total pulsar population (that is, both CPs\nand MSPs) of 102 . Npsr . 104 , a CP population of\n\n\fConstraints on GC Pulsar Populations\n\n15\n\nTable 4\nSummary of Pulsar Population Estimates by Method\nr \u2264 1 pc\nMethod\nPulsar Surveys\nRadio Point Sources\nRadio Spectrum A\nRadio Spectrum B-1\nRadio Spectrum C\nDiffuse Gamma-ray\nMassive Starsa\nPWNe\nSupernovaea,b\n\nr \u2264 150 pc\n\nCP\n\nMSP\n\nTotal\n\nCP\n\nMSP\n\nTotal\n\n.103\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n.102\n102\n.103\n\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n.103\n...\n.104 (fr /10\u22122 )\n\n...\n...\n< 7.4 \u00d7 103\n< 1.5 \u00d7 103\n(1.1 \u00b1 0.4) \u00d7 103\n...\n.103\n...\n.104\n\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n102\n\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n\u223c5 \u00d7 103\n...\n...\n\u0001\n103 fr /10\u22122\n\n&102\n.104\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n\na\n\nTypical values for the \"recycling fraction\" are fr & 10\u22123 in the Galactic field and potentially as\nhigh as fr & 0.1 in the central parsec (see Section 7.4)\nb Supernovae estimate given at r \u2264 20 pc and r \u2264 150 pc\n\nNCP . 102 and an MSP population of NMSP . 104 .\n10.1.2. Pulsar Population Within r \u2264 1 pc\n\nLimits on the pulsar population in the inner parsec of the\nGC have been set using the non-detections of high frequency directed pulsar searches, the spectrum of Sgr A*\non arcsecond scales, the population and star-formation\nhistory of the massive star progenitors of NSs, the observations of \u223c20 PWN candidates in the inner 20 pc, and\nthe limits on the SN rate based on X-ray observations in\nthe inner 20 pc.\nDirected pulsar searches of the inner parsec of the Galaxy\nhave been conducted with the GBT at frequencies of\n5, 9 and 15 GHz (Deneva et al. 2009; Macquart et al.\n2010). Since none of these searches made any detections,\nan upper limit may be set on the total pulsar population that is still consistent with a null result. Using the\nsurvey parameters provided in the Deneva et al. (2009)\nand Macquart et al. (2010) surveys, we find that up to\nNpsr . 103 pulsars (both CPs and MSPs) may be present\nin the inner parsec.\nSince the compact radio source Sgr A* is broadened by\ninterstellar scattering (\u22481\u2032\u2032 at 1 GHz), the observed flux\ndensity may actually be a combination of the emission\nnear the MBH and a diffuse component from a population of unresolved pulsars. By requiring that this twocomponent system reproduce the observed spectrum of\nSgr A*, constraints may be placed on the pulsar population on arcsecond scales. We consider a variety of spatial\ndistributions and find that a total population of \u223c103\npulsars is consistent with flux density measurements, regardless of spatial distribution. The existence of such a\nlarge pulsar population would distort the low-frequency\nmeasurements of the intrinsic spectrum of Sgr A* and\nthe free-free absorption along the line of sight of Sgr A*.\nUpper limits to the total pulsar population can also be\nset by studying the populations of massive stars that end\ntheir lives as NSs. Infrared observations of the present\nday population of massive stars allows for estimates of\nthe star formation history. We consider the case of two\ngeneral SFHs and find that the CP population can get as\nhigh as NCP . 200 only under the most favorable conditions. More typical estimates for the CP population\nare NCP \u223c 20, with most of these being formed in the\n\nyoung disk of massive stars located \u22480.5 pc from Sgr A*.\nThe MSPs are less sensitive to the exact SFH and produce populations of NMSP \u223c 200 with an upper limit of\nNMSP . 2000 for a range of reasonable SFHs.\nUpper limits on the number of CPs in the inner parsecs\nof the GC may be set using the detection of \u223c20 PWNe\nwithin 20 pc of Sgr A*. Using the \u223c20 PWN candidates\ncompiled by Muno et al. (2008) in a catalog of diffuse\nX-ray sources and assuming PWNe are produced at a\nconstant rate, we find that as many as 400 CPs may\nreside in the inner 20 pc. If the CP distribution follows\nthat of the PWN candidates, then as many as 80 CPs\ncould reside in the inner parsec.\nFinally, we consider measurements of the soft (kT \u2248\n0.8 keV) component of the diffuse X-ray plasma in the\ninner 20 pc. Assuming that the plasma was heated by\nthe transfer of kinetic energy from SNe, we may set\nan upper limit on the number of pulsars in this region\n(Muno et al. 2004). By considering two different cooling\nregimes, we find that the most extreme cooling scenario\nwill produce a population of up to \u223c103 CPs and \u223c106 fr\nMSPs. Thus, we can set upper bounds of NCP . 103 and\nNMSP . 104 (fr /10\u22122 ) for CPs and MSPs in the inner\n20 pc.\nOverall, we find that the above estimates are consistent\nwith a CP population of NCP . 100 and an MSP population of NMSP . 103 in the inner parsec of the GC.\n10.2. Conclusions\n\nCurrent observations of the GC are consistent with a\npopulation of up to \u223c103 active pulsars beamed toward\nEarth within the central parsec around Sgr A*. This total population may consist of up to NCP . 100 CPs and\nas many as NMSP . 103 MSPs. Such a population could\ndistort the low-frequency measurements of both the spectrum of Sgr A* and free-free absorption along the line of\nsight of Sgr A*. However, even with a potentially sizeable\ncollection of pulsars, the difficult observing conditions of\nthe inner regions of the GC will make individual detections a challenge. The strong interstellar scattering and\nlarge pulse broadening times mean that typical pulsar periodicity searches at radio wavelengths will be sensitive\nto pulsars only at high observing frequencies and large\nbandwidths (Cordes & Lazio 1997). Even if most of the\n\n\f16\npulsars lie below the detection threshold, \"giant\" pulses\nintrinsic to the pulsar or as the result of an enhancement\nthrough multipath scattering may make a pulsar visible a search for single pulses. Since there may be many\nmore MSPs than CPs, one may search for pulsars using interferometer imaging surveys of compact radio objects similar to that of Lazio & Cordes (2008). Finally,\nsearch methods should be considered at wavelengths less\naffected by the scattering effects of the ISM. Since many\nMSPs produce gamma-ray emission, a directed search\nof the GC region with the Fermi LAT could potentially\ndetect a pulsar in a blind periodicity search.\nDespite the difficulties in finding pulsars in the GC,\nthe detection of a pulsar orbiting Sgr A* with an orbital period of Porb . 100 yr would provide an unparalleled test of gravity in the strong-field regime and\ncould potentially allow the measurement of the spin\nand quadrupole moment of the MBH (Pfahl & Loeb\n2004; Laguna & Wolszczan 1997; Wex & Kopeikin 1999;\nLiu et al. 2012). Additionally, the detection of even one\npulsar in the inner few parsecs would provide an excellent\nprobe of the magneto-ionic material, the gravitational\npotential, and the star formation history in the vicinity\nof Sgr A*. In light of the significant scientific rewards\nand a potentially sizeable target population, we strongly\nrecommend continued pulsar searches in the GC across\na wide range of wavelengths.\nWe thank an anonymous referee for helpful comments\nthat improved the clarity of this paper.
