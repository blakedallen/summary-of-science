INTRODUCTION\nDwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs) are faint galaxies, whose luminosity L is 105 \u2013107 L\u2299 .\nThey are characterized by their low surface brightnesses (Gallagher & Wyse 1994 for a review).\nThe studies of such low-luminosity objects are important for several reasons. For example, since\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\nlower-mass galaxies are considered to have formed earlier in a hierarchical structure formation\nscenario based on the cold dark matter (CDM) model (e.g., Blumenthal et al. 1984), dSphs are\nalso expected to be a key to understand the physical properties of building blocks. Recently,\nthe observational data for the Local Group dSphs have become available with relatively high\nquality and their observed velocity dispersions imply that dSphs generally have high ratios of\nvirial mass to luminosity. Although a physical interpretation of this observational result has long\nbeen a matter of debate because tidal heating by the Galaxy could raise the velocity dispersions\n(Bellazzini, Fusi Pecci & Ferraro 1996; Kroupa 1997; Klessen & Kroupa 1998), now we have\nincreasing evidence that dSphs have a large amount of DM (Aaronson 1983; Mateo et al. 1993;\nHirashita, Kamaya & Takeuchi 1999) as predicted based on the CDM model.\nBased on the observational data, Hirashita, Takeuchi, & Tamura (1998, hereafter HTT98)\nhave discovered an interesting relation between the virial mass, Mvir , and the mass-to-light ratio,\nMvir /L: there exists a prominent discontinuity at Mvir \u223c 108 M\u2299 . Based on the assumption that a\ndSph is embedded in a DM-dominated potential well, HTT98 have given a physical interpretation\nto this queer relation and suggested a scenario for star formation in a dSph by considering an\ninitial starburst and a subsequent feedback of energy from SNe to the ISM. Although their scenario\nsucceeded in explaining the above relation, other kinds of properties of dSphs must be compared\nwith it to confirm the interpretation. In particular, their metallicities should be involved in, since\nthey reflect the star formation history (e.g., Tinsley 1980). Actually, the chemical enrichment\nhistory of dSphs remains to be tested along with the scenario in HTT98. Moreover, since the\nmetallicities of the dSphs are very low ([Fe/H] = \u22122.5 \u223c \u22121.5; Mateo 1998), they provide us\nvaluable opportunities to study the star formation that occurred in a low-metallicity gas cloud and\nto reveal the formation of first luminous objects in the early universe. In this Letter, therefore,\nwe focus on the observed virial mass\u2013metallicity (Mvir \u2013[Fe/H]) relation, and examine whether it\ncan be consistently understood in the same theoretical framework that succeeded in explaining\nthe mass\u2013luminosity (Mvir /L\u2013Mvir ) relation. The luminosity\u2013metallicity relation among dSphs as\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\nwell as dwarf elliptical galaxies (dEs) near the Galaxy and M31 has been investigated (Caldwell\net al. 1992, 1998; Caldwell 1999; Mateo 1998). However, if a dSph has a large amount of DM\nand formed stars in the DM-dominated potential, virial mass should be more fundamental than\nstellar mass in determining the dynamical timescale.\nThe rest of this Letter is organized as follows. In the next section, we show the observed\nmass\u2013metallicity relation for the dSphs after showing the sample and data. In \u00a7 3, the classical\nunderstanding of the relation is presented and the limitations on applying it to the dSphs are\npointed out. In \u00a7 4, we will propose a new scenario for chemical enrichment of the dSphs\nand discuss whether the mass\u2013metallicity and the mass\u2013luminosity relations are understood\nconsistently.\n\n2. THE SAMPLE AND THE MASS\u2013METALLICITY RELATION\nFor the two physical parameters, the virial mass (Mvir ) and the metallicity (here [Fe/H] is\nadopted), of the Local Group dSphs, we use the values and errors compiled by Mateo (1998). We\nadopt the data of Ursa Minor, Draco, Carina, Sextans, Sculptor, Fornax, Leo I, Leo II, NGC 147,\nNGC 185, NGC 205 (i.e., the same sample as that in HTT98). The values are renewed according\nto Mateo (1998), but this renewal does not affect the following discussions. The whole sample\nis divided into two groups at Mvir \u223c 108 M\u2299 : the low-mass group includes Ursa Minor, Draco,\nCarina, Sextans, Sculptor, Leo I, and Leo II; the others belong to the high-mass group. This\nclassification is based on the mass\u2013luminosity relation and is the same as that adopted by HTT98.\nWe show the observational mass\u2013metallicity relation of the dSphs in the present sample\nin Figure 1, where a shaded region is occupied by the low-mass dSphs. As the error bars of\n[Fe/H] in the figure, we adopt the intrinsic dispersions of [Fe/H] among stellar populations of\neach dSph, which are larger than the mean error of [Fe/H] (Mateo 1998). For virial masses,\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\nerrors are calculated by considering those of the central stellar velocity dispersion of a dSph and\nthe distance to it from the Galaxy. Since these two errors are on average \u223c 20% and \u223c 10%,\nrespectively (Mateo 1998), the resulting error of a virial mass is evaluated to be a factor of 1.6,\nwhich is adopted in Figure 1. The vertical line (Mvir = 5 \u00d7 107 M\u2299 ) indicates the boundary of\nthe two groups. To include Fornax in the high-mass group according to HTT98, the separating\nmass is smaller by a factor of 2 than that in HTT98. In the following, this separating virial mass\n(5 \u00d7 107 M\u2299 ) is shown as \u223c 108 M\u2299 by adopting its order of magnitude. We believe this description\nto be reasonable because it has an error as mentioned above.\nThe relation between the initial gas mass MG and [Fe/H] calculated in Yoshii & Arimoto\n(1987, hereafter YA87) is well represented by a single linear law. The solid line in Figure 1 is\nobtained by the least square fitting to the data of Table 1 in YA87, expressed as\n[Fe/H] = 0.745 log(MG /M\u2299 ) \u2212 7.55 ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere MG is the initial mass of the system and the luminosity-weighted [Fe/H] is adopted. In\nFigure 1, we adopt MG as the virial mass for the convenience in presentation. Since YA87 did not\ninclude the dark matter in their model, we may not be able to compare this relation directly with\nour Mvir \u2013[Fe/H] relation. However, it can be used as a reference for understanding the relation.\n\n3.\n\nCLASSICAL PICTURE AND ITS LIMITATION\n3.1. Binding Energy of the dSphs\n\nArimoto & Yoshii (1987) constructed a chemical and photometric evolution model for\nelliptical galaxies (see also Kodama & Arimoto 1997). Their scenario tells us that a more massive\nelliptical galaxy can retain the ISM longer than a less massive one, and will be chemically\nenriched further. Consequently their model predicts the mass\u2013metallicity sequence among\nelliptical galaxies, and it successfully explains a number of the observational properties of nearby\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\nelliptical galaxies (e.g., Davies et al. 1987; Bower, Lucey & Ellis 1992) and provides a reasonable\npicture of their evolutions (e.g., Stanford, Eisenhardt, & Dickinson 1998; Kodama et al. 1998).\nYA87 suggested that the galactic wind model can be extended to the mass range (< 109 M\u2299 ) of dEs\nand dSphs. The fitting to the prediction by YA87 (eq. [1]) is shown in Figure 1 (solid line). It is\nshown that YA87 roughly reproduced the overall trend in the observed mass\u2013metallicity relation.\nHowever, the above consideration overlooks a crucial piece in the physical processes of\nthe galaxy formation, which is the fact that the binding energy of a dSph with Mvir . 108 M\u2299 is\nroughly equal to or smaller than the energy released by several SNe (Saito 1979a). This indicates\nthat once a dSph begins to form stars actively, it can no longer sustain gas and thus it has no time\nto proceed with chemical enrichment efficiently. Therefore, a strongly regulated phase of star\nformation with an extremely low rate is necessary to enrich a low-mass dSph. Nishi & Tashiro\n(2000) have recently shown that a star formation activity in a cloud whose metallicity is less\nthan 1/100 times the solar value can be strongly regulated due to the lack of coolant. Since the\nobserved metallicities of the low-mass dSphs are comparable to 1/100 times the solar value, such\na regulation process is likely to have occurred in their formation epochs.\n\n3.2. Division of the dSphs into Two Groups at Mvir \u223c 108 M\u2299\nAs considered above, a special care should be taken to understand the mass\u2013metallicity\nrelation, especially for the dSphs with Mvir . 108 M\u2299 . Here, we present another piece of evidence\nthat motivates us to consider that a dSph in the low-mass range must be separated from a more\nmassive one.\nHTT98 have shown that there is a clear difference in the relation between Mvir /L and\nMvir for the two groups (the low-mass group with Mvir . 108 M\u2299 and the high-mass group with\nMvir & 108 M\u2299 ) of the Local Group dSphs. The Mvir /Ls of the low-mass dSphs are spread over a\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\nsignificantly wide range. HTT98 interpreted this to be a variation of the star formation efficiency\n(SFE). Here the SFE indicates the total mass of formed stars divided by the initial gas mass. A\nbrief summary of HTT98 will be given in the following.\nFirst, the discontinuity in the Mvir /L\u2013Mvir relation at Mvir \u223c 108 M\u2299 appears at the threshold\nwhere the ISM in the dSphs is blown away efficiently by successive supernovae (SNe). The\nvirial mass threshold of 108 M\u2299 is derived from the blow-away condition calculated by Mac Low\n& Ferrara (1999). A proto-dwarf galaxy in the high-mass group would consume gas relatively\ncompletely in making stars because its large binding potential sustains gas. Its stellar mass is\nresultantly proportional to initial gas mass and leads to an almost constant Mvir /L. Note that the\nratio of initial gas mass and dark mass in a proto-galaxy is assumed to be constant over entire\nmass range of dSphs. For a galaxy in the low-mass group, the ISM is predicted to be blown\naway efficiently by the SN explosions after the initial burst of star formation. It is essential to\nemphasize here that this scenario is built up on the basis of the fact that the binding energy of\na proto-dwarf galaxy is equal to the energy released by ten or less SNe. Therefore, if one OB\nassociation forms in a proto-dwarf galaxy, the galaxy can continue star formation until the heating\nby SNe affects the whole galaxy and cause a blowout of the ISM on a short timescale of \u223c 106\nyr. This implies that the resultant physical parameters of a proto-dwarf galaxy (mass, metallicity,\netc) after a blow-away are determined by the specific conditions of star formation such as the\nspatial distribution of gas, or temperatures of the first OB stars. As a result, we expect some\nkinds of stochastic behavior to appear in a resulting stellar mass and metallicity of the galaxy.\nSuch stochasticity can actually be found in the Mvir /L\u2013Mvir relation of the low-mass dSphs.\nAccording to Figure 1 in HTT98, the mass-to-light ratio (Mvir /L) ranges from \u223c 10 to \u223c 100 with\nan order-of-magnitude scatter.2 As explained in \u00a7 4.2, this is suggested to be caused by a scatter\n2\n\nAlthough HTT98 used a mass-to-light ratio of Leo I of \u223c 1, Mateo (1998) showed that it is\n\n4.6. We use the latter value here.\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\nof SFE with a similar order of magnitude.\nFinally, it is worth mentioning that the high-mass dSphs are also located on the extension\nfrom the sequence of dEs in the mass\u2013luminosity relation as well as the mass\u2013metallicity relation.\nActually, Mac Low & Ferrara (1999) suggested that the ISM in a high-mass dSph is not easily\nblown away by an initial burst, which implies that the classical picture holds for the high-mass\ndSphs. In contrast, it is suggested to be difficult for the low-mass dSphs to maintain star formation\nagainst the stellar feedback to proceed with chemical enrichment to the observed level because of\ntheir too small binding energy. Therefore, in the following, we focus on the dSphs in the low-mass\ngroup as a target to reconsider how their chemical enrichment has proceeded.\n\n4. DISCUSSIONS\n4.1. What Determines the Metallicity Level of the Low-Mass dSphs ?\nIf a formation of a dSph started from a proto-galactic gas cloud, the subsequent star formation\nafter a massive star forms is suggested to be self-regulated as long as the metallicity is . 1/100\ntimes the solar value (Nishi & Tashiro 2000). This is explained as follows. Since the metal-line\ncooling is extremely inefficient in such a low-metallicity environment, the coolant is H2 . However,\nthe UV radiation from a central massive star dissociates the H2 molecules, causing a strong\nregulation of star formation. This process avoids forming stars efficiently in a dSph belonging to\nthe low-mass group and enables a dSph to continue star formation without blowing away the ISM\nand allow chemical enrichment to proceed. Since several SNe release energy comparable to the\nbinding energy of the ISM, a star formation rate of a dSph in this phase should be considerably\nlow and thus chemical enrichment would also proceed gradually. If the metallicity finally reaches\nto [Fe/H] \u223c \u22122, with which the metal cooling becomes effective, a starburst may occur and a\nfollowing galactic wind would blow away the ISM. Nishi & Tashiro (2000) discussed how many\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\nSNe are required for a primordial gas cloud with \u223c 106 M\u2299 to have [Fe/H] \u223c \u22122. If their discussion\nis extended to the mass range for the dSphs in the low-mass group, it is found that about 500\nSNe are necessary, and thus a timescale of \u223c 1 Gyr is required. Here we assumed that SN\nexplosions caused by a massive star whose lifetime is \u223c 106 yr subsequently occurs one-by-one in\na proto-galactic gas cloud with the gas mass of 107 M\u2299 .\nThe mass of stars formed in the regulation phase can be estimated as follows. Adopting\nthe Salpeter's initial mass function (IMF) with the lower and upper cutoffs 0.1M\u2299 and 100M\u2299 ,\nrespectively, it is shown that the averaged mass of SN progenitors (stars whose mass is larger than\n10M\u2299 ) is 20M\u2299 . The total mass of the high-mass stars (i.e., SN progenitors) is 104 M\u2299 . Applying\nthe same IMF, the total stellar mass is calculated to be 8 \u00d7 104 M\u2299 . This is clearly much smaller\nthan the present stellar mass of dSphs. Thus, the majority of stars in the dSphs must be formed\nin the starburst after the regulation becomes ineffective. Consequently, if further significant\nchemical enrichment does not occur because of an instantaneous blow-out after the burst, a dSph\nwith Mvir . 108 M\u2299 would have an [Fe/H] \u223c \u22122 at the present epoch, which is consistent with the\nobserved metallicity as shown in Figure 1.\n\n4.2. Origin of the Scatter in the Mass\u2013Metallicity Relation among the Low-Mass dSphs\nIn the previous subsection, the origin of the observed metallicity levels of the dSphs in the\nlow-mass group was explored. As shown in Figure 1, it should also be emphasized that the\nmass\u2013metallicity relation among the low-mass dSphs is characterized by a significant scatter of\nmetallicity. We are now in a position to consider the origin of this metallicity variation.\nAccording to Pagel (1997, p. 219), the metallicity (Z) of a galaxy as a closed system is\nexpressed as\nZ = peff ln\n\ns+g\ng\n\n,\nt=tgw\n\n(2)\n\n\f\u2013 10 \u2013\nwhere peff is the yield of the chemical enrichment effective in the lifetime of the galaxy, and s and\ng are the masses of the stars and the gas, respectively. The metallicity is evaluated at the galactic\nwind era, tgw , since the chemical enrichment of the interstellar gas can proceed only up to tgw .\nSince dSphs lost a significant fraction of their gas at tgw (Saito 1979b), s \u226a g is adopted. Then we\nobtain\nZ \u2243 peff\n\ns\ng\n\n\u2261 peff SFE ,\n\n(3)\n\nt=tgw\n\nwhere we have defined the star formation efficiency (SFE) as s/g at tgw , that is, the stellar mass\nnormalized by the gas mass at tgw .\nAs stated in \u00a7 3.2, if the initial gas mass is proportional to the virial mass, Mvir /L of a dSph in\nthe low-mass group is approximately proportional to 1/SFE. Following this context, the SFEs of\nthe dSphs in the low-mass group are expected to spread over an order of magnitude because their\nMvir /Ls are distributed over a wide range with the similar magnitude. Since we see from equation\n(3) that the metallicity varies with SFE and, indeed, the [Fe/H] for the low-mass dSphs has about\n1 order of magnitude scatter, it is suggested that the scatter of [Fe/H] in the low-mass dSphs is\nconsistent with the variation of Mvir /L.\nFinally, we discuss the physical origin of the scatter of SFE among the low-mass dSphs.\nAs mentioned in \u00a7 3.2, this is likely to originate from that of initial condition in the formation\nof low-mass dSphs. Mac Low & Ferrara (1999) suggested that a blow-away condition depends\non the ellipticity of initial gas density distribution. This indicates that a star formation in a\nproto-dwarf galaxy also depends on the initial ellipticity, which is presumably determined at\nrandom (e.g. Bardeen et al. 1986). One of the other possibilities for the scatter of SFE is a\nvariation in temperatures of OB stars formed in a starburst. Since their ionizing photons dissociate\na surrounding H I region and suppress star formation, an SFE in a forming dSph is considered to\nbe affected by their temperatures. For a low-mass dSph, this effect can be severe because only a\nsmall number of OB stars form at one time and thus temperatures that he stars have are considered\n\n\f\u2013 11 \u2013\nto be determined stochastically. In order to evaluate quantitatively to what extent the observed\nscatter is reproduced by a reasonable range of variations of initial conditions, further theoretical\nstudies with stochastic processes are needed. It might be found from such studies that some\nexternal factors like environmental effects are required.\nIt may be noticed that in some dSphs (e.g., Draco, Andromeda II), large internal dispersions\nof metallicity among the stars are observed. If we consider the inhomogeneity of the distribution\nof gas density in a proto-galactic cloud, chemical enrichment in the galaxy can also proceed\ninhomogeneously because the outflow efficiency of gas differs from place to place. As a result,\ninternal dispersions of metallicity can be produced. Such an inhomogeneity could affect a\nmeasurement of an average [Fe/H] in a dSph because [Fe/H] of each dSph has been determined\nmainly by examining only a small number of giant stars especially for the Local Group dSphs. It\nmay be hence implied that an intrinsic dispersion of metallicity among the dSphs is difficult to\nfind based on the observed scatter of [Fe/H].\n\nWe are grateful to the anonymous referee for useful comments to improve the paper.
