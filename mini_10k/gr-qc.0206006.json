This fact could have far\u2013\nreaching consequences, for instance, it could imply ultraviolet regularization in field\ntheory [4].\nA second, and also very interesting prediction of these quantum gravity models\ncomprises the so called deformed dispersion relation (which characterizes the propagation of massless particles) [5, 6, 7]. In connection with this last feature it has to\nbe mentioned that if photons propagate with an energy dependent velocity, then this\ncould imply the breakdown of Lorentz invariance [8].\nIn the present work it will be assumed that quantum gravity corrections appear\nas nonconformal stochastic fluctuations of the metric. It will be shown that these\nkind of fluctuations lead to the emergence of a deformed dispersion relation, for the\npropagation of photons, and that they imply the breakdown of Lorentz invariance.\nAdditionally, it will be proved that they also render a modification of Heisenberg\nalgebra. Confronting our model with the so called quantum \u03ba\u2013Poincar\u00e9 group [3] will\nallow us to deduce that the fluctuation\u2013dissipation theorem could be fulfilled without\nneeding a restoring mechanism associated with the intrinsic fluctuations of spacetime\n[9]. We may rephrase this stating that the loss of quantum information is related\nto the fact that the spacetime symmetries are described by the quantum \u03ba\u2013Poincar\u00e9\ngroup, and not by the usual Poincar\u00e9 symmetries. Finally, an upper bound for the\nfree parameters of our model will be obtained.\n\n2\n\n2.1\n\nNonconformal metric fluctuations and propagation of photons\nNonconformal fluctuations and white noise\n\nLet us now suppose that the spacetime metric undergoes nonconformal stochastic\nfluctuations, and that these fluctuations represent white noise. This last condition\nseems to be a reasonable one [10], neverwithstanding, the introduction of color noise\ncould be an interesting issue to analyze. In the context of decoherence effects, the\npossibilities that conformal flutuations offer have already been studied [10], and as will\nbecome clear below, no deformed dispersion relation, or modification to Heisenberg\nalgebra, could emerge in this context. Hence, in order to have a richer spectrum of\npossibilities we introduce now nonconformal fluctuations of the background metric.\n\n2\n\n\fThe nonconformal character implies that, from the outset, the maximal symmetry\nof the vacuum of the classical gravitational field will not be preserved. The loss of\nthis characteristic allows us to introduce the so called quantum \u03ba\u2013Poincar\u00e9 group\n[3] as part of our model, and therefore it will be possible to explain to absence of a\nrestoring mechanism, associated with the fluctuations of spacetime, as a consequence\nof the loss of Lorentz invariance.\nHence, in the case where the average background metric is the Minkowkian one,\nwe may write\nds2 = e\u03c8(x) \u03b700 dt2 + e\u03b6(x) \u03b7ij dxi dxj .\n\n(1)\n\nHere we demand the following properties\n< e\u03c8(x) \u03b700 >= \u03b700 ,\n\n(2)\n\n< e\u03b6(x) \u03b7ij >= \u03b7ij .\n\n(3)\n\nFrom these last two expressions we conclude (assuming |\u03c8(x)| << 1)\n< \u03c8(x) >= 0,\n\n(4)\n\n< \u2202\u03bc \u03c8(x) >= 0.\n\n(5)\n\nThese last conditions are related to the fact that \u03c8(x) is white noise [10]. Of\ncourse, \u03b6(x) fulfills the same conditions. From (5) we find that < \u03c8(x)2 >= cte., and\nif these fluctuations have a gaussian behavior, then\n< \u03c8 2 (x) >= \u03c312 ,\n3\n\n(6)\n\n\f< \u03b6 2 (x) >= \u03c322 ,\n\n(7)\n\n\u03c312 and \u03c322 denote the corresponding square deviations.\n\n2.2\n\nDeformed dispersion relation\n\nLet us now consider a photon moving in this spacetime. Its four\u2013momentum, p\u03bc =\n(E, ~p), satisfies\np\u03bc p\u03bc = e\u03c8(x) \u03b700 (E)2 + e\u03b6(x) \u03b7ij (pi pj ) = 0.\n\n(8)\n\nFrom here on we set c = 1, and also define \u03c6(x) = \u03c8(x) \u2212 \u03b6(x). At this point it\nis noteworthy to mention that the conditions imposed upon the metric fluctuations\nimply that < \u03c8(x)\u03b6(x) >= 0.\nFrom our starting conditions we find that\nh\n\ni\n\np2 = E 2 1 + \u03c6(x) + O(\u03c62(x)) .\n\n(9)\n\nKeeping only \u03c6(x) in (9), and averaging, we obtain\n\n<(\n\np2 \u2212 E 2 2\n) >= \u03c312 + \u03c322 .\nE2\n\n(10)\n\nLet L denote the largest distance between two points, such that they behave in a\ncoherent way under the fluctuations \u03b6(x) (while T is the corresponding time associated\nwith \u03c8(x)). If we accept that: (i) these fluctuations are quantum gravity corrections\nto the Minkowskian metric, and (ii) Planck length might appear together with other\nlength scales in the problem [11]; then we may introduce the following assumption\n\u03c312 = a2 L2p /L2 ,\n4\n\n(11)\n\n\f\u03c322 = e2 Tp2 /T 2 .\n\n(12)\n\nHere TP and Lp denote the Planck length and time, respectively, while a and\ne are real numbers. This kind of relation, between square deviation and Planck\nlength, has already been derived [10, 12]. Of course, this Ansatz requires a deeper\nanalysis, and it does not discard other possibilities [13]. Clearly our model contains\nfour free parameter, i.e., e, a, T , and L, which can not be deduced in the context of\nour assumptions.\n\u221a\nIntroducing the real number \u03b2 = a2 + b2 (here we have defined T = \u03c7L, and\nb = e/\u03c7, with \u03c7 \u2208 Re), we may rewrite (10) as\n\u0010 p2\n\n\u2212 E2 \u0011\n= \u03b2Lp /L.\nE2\n\n(13)\n\nIn other words, we may reduce the number of free paramaters from four to only\ntwo, \u03b2 and L.\n) is,\nAssuming that the Hamiltonian formulation of classical mechanics (v = \u2202E\n\u2202p\napproximately, valid, we find the speed of propagation of the photon, from here on c\nis introduced explicitly\nh\n\nv =c 1\u2212\n\n2.3\n\n\u03b2Lp i\n.\n2L\n\n(14)\n\nGeneralized Uncertainty Principle\n\nLet us now consider a simple experiment, the position of the photon will be now\nmonitored. In this situation (and remembering that expressions (13) and (14) have\nalready a statistical meaning, since they have been deduced by an averaging process)\nwe will have an additional uncertainty source, namely, the speed of the photon has\nan uncertainty given by\n\n5\n\n\f\u2206v = c\n\n\u03b2Lp\n.\n2L\n\n(15)\n\nHence, combining linearly the effects of our two uncertainty sources, the uncertainty in the position becomes\n\n\u2206x = c\u2206t + c\n\n\u03b2Lp\nT\u0302 .\n2L\n\n(16)\n\nHere \u2206t denotes the uncertainty in the emission of the photon, and T\u0302 is the time\nthe experiment lasts. Assuming that \u2206t \u223c h\u0304/\u2206E (this condition could be not very\nstringent, indeed, it is valid not only in the context of quantum mechanics, but even in\nbroader frameworks, for instance, in the quantum deformations of the D = 4 Poincar\u00e9\ngroups [14]) we may cast (16) as\n\n\u2206x = h\u0304/\u2206p + c\n\n\u03b2Lp\nT\u0302 .\n2L\n\n(17)\n\nThe modification of the uncertainty principle is not a new issue [1, 2, 3], and can\nbe derived in the context of quantum geometry [15], black\u2013hole effects [16], quantum\nmeasurements at Planck scale [17], and even in Newtonian gravity theory [18]. In the\npresent work we have derived it without considering a particular quantum gravity\ntheory, as loop quantum gravity [7], or resorting to a relation between mass and the\nradius of a Schwarzschild black\u2013hole [1].\nExpression (17) implies that the corresponding Heisenberg algebra is not the usual\none. Its is readily checked that our uncertainty principle can be obtained from the\nfollowing commutator for the quantum operators x\u0302 and p\u0302\n\u0010\n\n[x\u0302, p\u0302] = ih\u0304 1 + c\n\n\u0011\n\u03b2Lp q\nT\u0302 (p\u0302\u2212 < p\u0302 >)2 .\n2h\u0304L\n\n6\n\n(18)\n\n\f3\n\nConclusions\n\nAssuming that quantum gravity corrections appear as nonconformal stochastic fluctuations of the metric it has been shown that a deformed dispersion relation, and a\nmodification of Heisenberg algebra, unavoidably, emerge.\nConcerning our model it is noteworthy to mention that it establishes a peculiar\nasymmetry. Indeed, it seems to discard the most general case [2], namely, the possibility of having on the right hand side of (18) functions of the position operator, x\u0302.\nExpression (8) also allows us to conclude that conformal fluctuations do not lead to\na modification of Heisenberg algebra (there is also no deformed dispersion relation).\nFrom previous results [10] it seems that nonconformal fluctuations would also imply the presence of decoherence effects, i.e., decoherence between macroscopically different situations would appear as a consequence of the gravitational vacuum (clearly\nthis statement has to be supported with the corresponding calculations, an issue that\nwill be published elsewhere).\nAn interesting claim comprises the possibility that the so called \u03ba\u2013Poincar\u00e9 symmetries could contain some of the physics of the quantum gravity vacuum [3, 14].\nStarting with (17) we may confront our conclusions with the implications of the\nquantum \u03ba\u2013Poincar\u00e9 group (here we bear in mind expression (2.13b) of [14]). In\norder to do this, let us consider a photon with average energy given by the usual\n\u03b2Lp\nexpression, E = h\u0304\u03bd, then \u03bd = c 2\u03b1h\u0304L\nT\u0302 \u2206p (here \u03b1 is the parameter in (2.13b) of [14]).\nImposing energy conservation, we deduce \u2206p \u223c 1/T\u0302 . This last fact means that the\nroot\u2013mean\u2013square deviation, \u03c3, associated with the measurement of distance fulfills\n\u03c3 \u223c T\u0302 , i.e., a behavior already deduced [9], and which matches with the claim [13]\nthat the dynamics, underlying the fundamental nature of spacetime, does not produce\nany dissipation, and, in consequence, the fluctuation\u2013dissipation theorem is fulfilled\nwithout having a restoring mechanism associated with the intrinsic fluctuations of\nspacetime. In other words, the matching of our model and the quantum \u03ba\u2013Poincar\u00e9\ngroup entails the loss of quantum information, though this happens in the present\nwork at a rate faster than in the usual case [9, 13], where this loss grows as T\u0302 1/2 .\nFrom the last remarks we may state that the loss of quantum information is related\nto the fact that the spacetime symmetries are described by the quantum \u03ba\u2013Poincar\u00e9\ngroup, and not by the usual Poincar\u00e9 symmetries. An interesting issue in connection\nwith this statement comprises the formulation of a quantum measurement theory\nemploying as spacetime symmetries those of the quantum \u03ba\u2013Poincar\u00e9 group.\nRecently it has been claimed [8] that if a theory predicts that photons propagate\nwith an energy dependent velocity, then Lorentz invariance breaks down. In our\ncase this should be no surprise, since we have shown that we may incorporate in\n7\n\n\fthe present model the quantum \u03ba\u2013Poincar\u00e9 group. Considering a non trivial boost\ntransformation (and also \u03b2 6= 0) along the direction of propagation of the photon, we\nfind that Lorentz invariance breaks down, namely, \u03b2/L does not behave in the usual\nway.\nWe may now evaluate the possible order of magnitude of the extra term in (13).\nTo set a very rough upper bound on these kind of contributions, let us assume that the\nmeasurements readouts of the speed of light, c[1\u00b1\u01eb], are such that \u01eb (the uncertainty in\nthe experimental results) stems, exclusively, from fluctuations of the metric, namely,\np\n. This is not a realistic assumption, nonetheless, it will allows us to\nwe have \u01eb = |\u03b2|L\n2L\nfind a rough upper bound to these effects. From already known results for the speed\nof light [19] we obtain\nL/|\u03b2| \u2264 10\u221225 cm.\n\n(19)\n\nAcknowledgments.\nThe author would like to thank A. A.
