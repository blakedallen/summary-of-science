INTRODUCTION\n\nThe Anomalous X\u2013ray Pulsars (AXPs; see Mereghetti\n2008, for a recent review) were initially identified as a subclass of accreting X\u2013ray pulsars. Their much softer X\u2013ray\nspectrum and the lack of a bright optical counterpart distinguished them from the vast majority of X\u2013ray pulsars, which\nare neutron stars accreting in high mass X\u2013ray binary systems.\nAXPs have rotation periods of several seconds and show a\nsecular spin-down on timescales of 103 \u2013105 years, but their\nrotational energy loss is smaller than their X\u2013ray luminosity,\nexcluding the possibility that they are rotation-powered, like\nradio pulsars. It is generally believed that the AXPs, as well as\nanother small class of high-energy sources with similar properties, the Soft Gamma-ray Repeaters (SGRs), are magnetars,\ni.e. neutron stars powered by their extremely high magnetic\nfield (\u223c1015 G; Duncan & Thompson 1992; Thompson &\nDuncan 1996).\nThe soft X-ray (1\u201310 keV) spectra of magnetars cannot\nbe adequately fit with single component models whenever\ndata with good count statistics are available. Successful fits\nare instead obtained by a two component model consisting\nof a steep power-law (photon index \u223c3\u20134) and a blackbody\n(kT \u223c 0.5 keV). Some attempts have been done, also based on\nphase-resolved spectroscopy, to attribute the two components\nto physically distinct processes (e.g. Tiengo et al. 2005), but\nno particularly compelling interpretations could be obtained.\nOne problem of this model is that it tends to give best-fit values of the interstellar absorption higher than those independently estimated in other ways (e.g. Durant & van Kerkwijk\n2006). Another problem is that the power-law component\ncannot be extrapolated at lower energies without exceeding\nthe flux of the near infrared (NIR) and optical counterparts\n(e.g. Hulleman et al. 2004). Drastic, and possibly unphysical,\nElectronic address: tiengo@iasf-milano.inaf.it\n1 Based on observations obtained with XMM-Newton, an ESA science\nmission with instruments and contributions directly funded by ESA Member States and NASA.\n2 Universit\u00e0 di Pavia, Dipartimento di Fisica Nucleare e Teorica and INFNPavia, via Agostino Bassi 6, 27100 Pavia, Italy\n\ncut-offs in the power-law component are required to match\nthe low optical/NIR fluxes.\nIn some AXPs good spectral fits are obtained with the sum\nof two blackbody components with different temperatures.\nSince this model does not suffer of the problems described\nabove, it is usually preferred to the power-law plus blackbody\nmodel (e.g. Halpern & Gotthelf 2005). However, also this\nmodel is only phenomenological and it is inadequate to represent the non-thermal phenomena that are expected to occur in\nthe highly magnetized magnetosphere of magnetars (e.g. Lyutikov & Gavriil 2006). More physical models of the X\u2013ray\nspectra, including the effects of the strong magnetic field and\ncharged currents, have recently been developed and successfully applied to a sample of magnetar candidates (Fern\u00e1ndez\n& Thompson 2007; G\u00fcver et al. 2007; Rea et al. 2008).\nFrom a purely observational point of view, it has not been\npossible to discriminate between the different models reproducing the magnetar X\u2013ray spectra. This is mainly due to the\nlow sensitivity of hard X\u2013ray detectors above \u223c10 keV and to\nthe large uncertainties in the fits introduced by the high interstellar absorption, that severely suppresses the flux below \u223c1\nkeV. Being young neutron stars born from massive progenitors, all the Galactic magnetars are located in highly absorbed\nregions of the Galactic plane. All of them have column densities NH ranging from \u223c5 \u00d7 1021 to \u223c1023 cm\u22122 . The two\nknown magnetars in the Magellanic Clouds, being considerably less absorbed, offer the possibility to better constrain the\nspectra in the low energy range. The study of SGR 0526\u201366,\nlocated in the Large Magellanic Cloud, is complicated by the\npresence of the surrounding supernova remnant N49, which\nis particularly bright in soft X\u2013rays (Kulkarni et al. 2003).\nHere we concentrate therefore on the spectral properties of\nCXOU J010043.1\u2013721134 (Lamb et al. 2002, 2003; McGarry\net al. 2005), the only known AXP in the Small Magellanic\nCloud (SMC).\n\n\fPeriod\n(s)\n\nA\nB\nCa\nD\nE\nF\n\n17 Oct 2000\n20 Nov 2001\n27 Mar 2005\n27 Nov 2005\n29 Nov 2005\n11 Dic 2005\n\n14\n22\n***\n14\n13\n9\n\n20\n27\n24\n17\n16\n16\n\n8.019(1)\n8.0193(9)\n8.0215(9)\n8.022(1)\n8.022(1)\n8.022(2)\n\na The PN data were not considered, since the PN instrument was operated with the filter wheel in closed position.\n\n2. OBSERVATIONS AND DATA ANALYSIS\n\nThe field containing CXOU J010043.1\u2013721134 was observed six times3 with the XMM-Newton satellite (see Table\n1). Here we report the analysis of the data collected by the\nEPIC instrument, which is composed by one PN (Str\u00fcder et al.\n2001) and two MOS X\u2013ray cameras (Turner et al. 2001).\nCXOU J010043.1\u2013721134 was not the main target of the\nobservations, but, being at an off-axis angle of \u223c6\u2032 , it was\nalways well inside the field of view of the EPIC instrument\n(\u223c15\u2032 radius). All the observations were performed with\nthe medium optical blocking filter and in Full Frame mode\n(time resolution of 73 ms and 2.6 s for the PN and MOS, respectively), except for the first PN observation, done in Extended Full Frame mode (time resolution of 200 ms). All the\ndata were processed using the XMM-Newton Science Analysis Software (SAS version 7.1.0) and the calibration files released in August 2007. The standard pattern selection criteria\n(patterns 0\u20134 for PN and 0\u201312 for MOS) were adopted.\nSource spectra were extracted for each observation from\ncircular regions with 25\u2032\u2032 radius. The background spectra were extracted from a 94\u2032\u2032 \u00d772\u2032\u2032 box centered at RA =\n01h 00m 56.s 8, Dec. = \u221272\u25e6 11\u2032 33\u2032\u2032 and rotated such that it\nintercepts no CCD gaps in any PN image. Response matrices\nand ancillary files for each spectrum were produced using the\nSAS software.\nThe spectra were fitted to a set of models (power-law, blackbody, blackbody plus power-law, and two blackbodies, all\nmodified by photoelectric absorption) using XSPEC version\n11.3.1. The single component models gave only marginally\nacceptable fits in most observations, while better results were\nobtained with the two component models. The best-fit parameters of the latter models are reported in Table 2.\nIn order to check for flux variability, we have also simultaneously fit the five available PN spectra and the two MOS\nspectra for observation C with a double blackbody model with\nall parameters linked to the same value and a variable normalization factor. From this analysis we can exclude significant\n(>3 \u03c3) flux variations larger than \u223c20% among the different\nXMM-Newton observations.\nSince no significant differences in the spectral parameters\nare detected and the calibration of the PN instrument has\nproven to be very stable throughout the XMM-Newton mission (see, e.g., Kirsch et al. 2005), a cumulative spectrum of\n3\nOnly the data of the two first observations have already been published\n(Lamb et al. 2002; Naz\u00e9 et al. 2004; Majid et al. 2004; McGarry et al. 2005;\nNakagawa et al. 2007); we reanalyzed them using more recent calibration\nfiles, in order to consistently compare the results with those of the new observations.\n\n0.01\n10\u22123\n\nMOS exposure\n(ks)\n\n4\n\nPN exposure\n(ks)\n\n2\n\nDate\n\n\u22124 \u22122 0\n\nObs.\n\nCounts s\u22121 keV\u22121\n\nTABLE 1\nL OG OF THE XMM-Newton O BSERVATIONS OF\nCXOU J010043.1\u2013721134.

The best-fit double blackbody model is also\nshown together with the residuals and the separate contribution of the two\nblackbody components (dotted and dash-dotted lines).\n\nthe PN data of observations B, D, E, and F4 has also been extracted. The resulting net exposure time is 58 ks. Only the\ndouble blackbody model gives an acceptable fit to the cumulative spectrum with kT1 \u223c 0.3 keV and kT2 \u223c 0.7 keV (see\nFig. 1 and Table 2). The hydrogen column density is in good\nagreement with the average value of NH = 5.9 \u00d7 1020 cm\u22122\nexpected towards this region of the SMC (Dickey & Lockman 1990). The observed flux in the 2\u201310 keV energy range\nis 1.4 \u00d7 10\u221213 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 , corresponding to an unabsorbed\nluminosity of 6.1 \u00d7 1034 erg s\u22121 for a distance of 60 kpc. The\ndouble blackbody model gave also the lowest \u03c72 values for\nthe spectra of the single observations, but in those cases it\nwas not the only one compatible with the data. In particular, the power-law plus blackbody model, that is rejected with\nhigh confidence by the fit to the cumulative spectrum, gave\nacceptable fits to all the single spectra.\nIn addition to the phenomenological models described\nabove, we have also fitted the cumulative spectrum with the\nmagnetar spectral model described in Rea et al. (2008). This\nmodel, originally proposed by Lyutikov & Gavriil (2006), is\nbased on cyclotron resonant scattering of blackbody radiation in a twisted magnetosphere (Thompson et al. 2002). Although the resulting \u03c72r (1.20 for 100 degrees of freedom) is\nslightly worse than for the double blackbody model, the fit is\nacceptable. The photoelectric absorption (NH = 5 \u00b1 1 \u00d7 1020\ncm\u22122 ) and blackbody temperature (kT = 0.32 \u00b1 0.08 keV)\nare consistent with the values derived from the double black20\n\u22122\nbody fit (NH = 6.3+2.0\n\u22121.6 \u00d7 10 cm and kT = 0.30 \u00b1 0.02 keV\nfor the cooler blackbody). The best-fit values of the other\nspectral parameters are a resonant scattering optical depth of\n\u03c4res = 1.2 \u00b1 0.2 and a particle velocity of \u03b2T = 0.48 \u00b1 0.12.\nThese parameters are in the same range as the ones observed\nin the other magnetar candidates (Rea et al. 2008). Although\na direct information on the size of the emitting region cannot\nbe derived in the current version of this model, an approximate estimate gives a radius similar to the one of the cooler\ncomponent in the double blackbody model.\nBy inspecting the residuals from the best-fit models, we\nfound no significant absorption or emission narrow-line features.

The results for the high-statistics cumulative PN spectrum are summarized in Fig. 2, where the plotted\ncurves represent the 3 \u03c3 upper limits for \u03c3E = 0 eV.\nWe performed a timing analysis to measure the source pulse\nperiod in each data set. After correcting the photon arrival\ntimes to the Solar system barycenter, we derived the best period values based on a Z22 periodogram analysis (Buccheri\net al. 1983). The resulting values are indicated in Table 1.\nConsidering also the periods measured by Chandra (McGarry\net al. 2005), a linear fit to the ten values yields a period derivative \u1e56 = (1.9 \u00b1 0.1) \u00d7 10\u221211 s s\u22121 (\u03c72r of 1.32 for 8 degrees of\nfreedom).\nSince observation D and E were performed only two days\napart, we tried to better constrain the spin-down rate through a\nphase-coherent timing analysis of the two datasets. However,\nthe periods uncertainties during each observation are too large\n\n3. DISCUSSION\n\nThe new XMM-Newton observations reported here indicate\nthat CXOU J010043.1\u2013721134 continued to spin-dow at a\nrate of \u223c1.9 \u00d7 10\u221211 s s\u22121 , consistent with previous results\n(McGarry et al. 2005). Although the errors on P are quite\nlarge, there is no evidence for major torque changes. Also the\npulse profile, spectral shape and flux are consistent with no\nmajor changes, confirming that this AXP is one of the most\nstable members of its class. This characteristic allows us to\nsum up all the XMM-Newton observations taken with the same\ninstrumental settings.\nThe cumulative PN spectrum of CXOU J010043.1\u2013721134\ncannot be adequately fit by a power-law plus blackbody\nmodel. This is the first magnetar for which such a conclu5 We selected the shifts that maximized the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistics\ncomparing subsequent observations.\n6 The pulsed fraction is defined as (C\nmax \u2212Cmin )/(Cmax +Cmin ), where Cmax\nand Cmin are the background-subtracted count rates at the peak and at the\nminimum.\n\n\f4\n\nA. Tiengo et al.\n\nF IG . 3.- Background subtracted pulse profile of CXOU J010043.1\u2013\n721134 in different energy ranges (as indicated in the panels) and corresponding hardness ratio (PN data of observations B, D, E, F).\n\nsion can be derived based only on the X\u2013ray data, thanks to\nthe very low interstellar absorption.\nA good fit is instead obtained with a double blackbody\nmodel. The known distance of the SMC (60 kpc, Keller &\nWood 2006) allows a precise measure of the size of the emitting region of the two blackbodies. The \u223c2 km radius of the\nregion associated to the hotter component is compatible with\na hot spot on the neutron star surface. The radius of the emitting region of the cooler blackbody, 12.1+2.1\n\u22121.4 km, is consistent\nwith a large fraction of the magnetar surface. However, the\nstrong pulsation below 1 keV (see Fig. 3), where this component dominates (see Fig. 1), indicates that it cannot come\nfrom the whole neutron star surface. A similarly large blackbody radius (\u223c10 km) was also derived from the spectrum of\nthe AXP XTE J1810\u2013197 observed by ROSAT before the onset of its outburst in 2003 (Halpern & Gotthelf 2005) and from\nphase-resolved spectroscopy of XMM-Newton observations of\nthe same object (Israel et al. 2008) and of the AXP 1E 1048.1\u2013\n5937 (Tiengo et al. 2005). However, in these cases, the less\naccurately known distance and the high interstellar absorption\nproduce large uncertainties on the emitting region size.\nAssuming that the thermal photons are produced on the\nneutron star surface (and not, for instance, in the magnetosphere) and considering that the blackbody is the most\nefficient thermal emission process at a given temperature,\nthe radius of the region emitting the colder blackbody in\n\nCXOU J010043.1\u2013721134 is a firm lower limit to the radius\nof the compact object. This limit is not large enough to exclude any of the most popular equations of state for neutron\nstars, but it is the most constraining lower limit ever obtained\nfor a magnetar.\nMagnetar spectra are expected to be more complex than\na double blackbody. In fact most magnetar spectra cannot\nbe fitted by such a simple model, that underestimates their\nemission in the 5\u201310 keV energy range. In all these cases a\npower-law tail in hard X\u2013rays (>20 keV) has been detected\n(see, e.g., Kuiper et al. 2006; G\u00f6tz et al. 2006; Leyder et al.\n2008) and it is likely responsible also for the hard excess below 10 keV (Nakagawa et al. 2007). From a theoretical point\nof view, the emission expected from a magnetar has two components, with a thermal part directly from the surface, and a\nnon-thermal one due to emission reprocessed in the magnetosphere (Lyutikov & Gavriil 2006; Fern\u00e1ndez & Thompson\n2007). We found that also CXOU J010043.1\u2013721134 can be\nfit by a model of this kind (Rea et al. 2008).\nNo compelling detections of spectral features in the persistent X\u2013ray emission of magnetars have been reported so\nfar. XMM-Newton and Chandra observations yielded strong\nupper limits (equivalent width .10 eV) for 4U 0142+61\n(Juett et al. 2002), 1E 1048.1\u22125937 (Tiengo et al. 2005), and\n1E 2259+586 (Woods et al. 2004) in the 0.7\u20135 keV range.\nHowever, the high interstellar absorption towards these objects causes a series of absorption edges in the observed spectrum at low energies, introducing large systematic uncertainties in the search for features in the intrinsic AXP spectrum. A\nhint of a spectral feature at \u223c0.9 keV was noted by Durant &\nvan Kerkwijk (2006) in the spectrum of the AXP 4U 0142+61,\nafter its deconvolution from interstellar absorption using the\nedges directly observed in the high resolution X\u2013ray spectra,\nbut also this measure is affected by the poorly constrained\nabundances of most interstellar elements. As shown in Figure\n2, for CXOU J010043.1\u2013721134 we did not find evidence for\nlines, but, although this source is one of the dimmest AXPs,\nwe could put stringent limits on narrow features in the soft\nX\u2013ray band, which are virtually independent of the photoelectric absorption model. The dipolar magnetic field derived from the spin-down rate of CXOU J010043.1\u2013721134\nis 4 \u00d7 1014 G, corresponding to a proton cyclotron energy of\n\u223c2.5 keV; however, a cyclotron line at lower energies is expected if the cyclotron emission or absorption process occurs\nfar from the neutron star surface, while a feature at higher\nenergies is produced if strong multipolar magnetic field components are present. These effects, in addition to other processes that can suppress the spectral features (see, e.g., Ho\n& Lai 2003), make the lack of proton cyclotron lines in the\nX\u2013ray spectra of magnetars compatible with their magnetic\nfields of (6\u2013250) \u00d7 1013 G (corresponding to proton cyclotron\nenergies of 0.4\u201315 keV) derived from their timing properties.\nWe thank Nanda Rea for fitting the spectrum with the RCS\nmodel and useful discussion.
