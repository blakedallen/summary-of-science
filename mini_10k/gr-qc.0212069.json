The experiment will place into Earth orbit a\nspacecraft containing four gyroscopes and a telescope (for\ndetails of the experiment see [1, 2]). The gyroscopes are\n4 cm diameter fused quartz or single crystal silicon balls,\nmachined to be as spherical as possible (to tolerances\nbetter than one ppm), and coated with a thin film of\nniobium. At the low temperatures provided by a dewar\nof superfluid Helium surrounding the gyroscope assembly, the niobium is superconducting, and each spinning\ngyroscope has a London magnetic moment parallel to its\nspin axis (stray magnetic fields, such as those due to the\nEarth, will have been suppressed by many orders of magnitude before the niobium goes superconducting). The\norientations of the gyros' magnetic moments are measured via changes in the magnetic flux through superconducting current loops that encircle each gyro, and that\nare attached to the gyroscope housing. The four gyros\nwill initially have their spins aligned parallel to the symmetry axis of the spacecraft, which coincides with the\noptical axis of the telescope mounted on the end of the\nspacecraft. In order to average out numerous unwanted\ntorques on the gyros, the spacecraft will rotate about its\nsymmetry axis at a rate of between one and 10 times per\nminute.\nAccording to general relativity, a perfect gyroscope in\norbit about the Earth will precess relative to distant inertial frames because of two effects. The first, and most\nimportant, is the dragging of inertial frames, caused by\nthe rotation of the Earth, also called the Lense-Thirring\neffect. Over a time of one year, for a polar orbit of about\n640 km altitude, this causes the gyroscopes to precess\n\n\u2217 cmw@wuphys.wustl.edu;\n\nwugrav.wustl.edu/People/CLIFF\n\nin an East-West direction by around 42 milliarcseconds\n(mas). The second is the geodetic precession, caused by\nthe curved spacetime around the Earth. This effect results in an annual precession in the North-South direction\nof about 6600 milliarcseconds.\nThe reference direction to the \"distant stars\" is provided by the on-board telescope, which is to be trained\non a star IM Pegasus (HR 8703) in our galaxy. One important feature of this star is that it is also a strong radio\nsource, so that its direction and proper motion relative to\nthe larger system of astronomical reference frames can be\nmeasured accurately using Very Long Baseline Radio Interferometry (VLBI). In order to reduce telescope errors\nand biases, the spacecraft will be \"steered\" by attitude\ncontrol forces to keep the centroid of the stellar image\ncentered on the telescope axis.\nHowever, because the spacecraft orbits the Earth and\nthe Earth orbits the Sun, the apparent direction to the\nstar will vary in a periodic manner because of stellar aberration, which amounts to five arcseconds from the orbital\nmotion, and to 20 arcseconds from the annual motion of\nthe Earth. These are both substantially larger than the\nframe-dragging effect being measured. But, far from being an annoying ancillary effect getting in the way of\ntesting relativity, the aberration of starlight is in fact\ncentral to the success of the experiment [3]. The reason\nis that the SQUID magnetometers that are connected to\nthe current loops surrounding the gyros do not measure\nangle, they measure voltage, induced by the varying magnetic flux threading the loops. They must therefore be\ncalibrated to provide a scale factor that converts voltage\nto angle. Because the orbit of the spacecraft, the location of the star and the speed of light can all be established to high precision, the aberration of starlight can\nbe predicted accurately. It can also be separated from\nthe relativistic precessions because of its unique temporal variability over the 12+ months of the science phase\nof the mission. Through this means, the experiment can\nbe calibrated with an accuracy sufficient to achieve the\ndesired overall accuracy.\nIn such a complex and delicate experiment, there are\n\n\f2\nnumerous sources of error, including anomalous, nonrelativistic torques on the gyros, variations in electronics\nresponses, errors in guide star position and proper motion, effects of accumulated charges on the rotors from\ncosmic rays and other charged particles, and so on. Nevertheless, the team that is mounting this experiment\n\u2013 Stanford University, Lockheed-Martin Space Systems,\nand NASA \u2013 has proposed that a measurement of the relativistic precessions at the level of 0.4 mas/yr is feasible;\nthis would provide a test of relativistic frame dragging\nat the one percent level and of the geodetic effect at the\nlevel of 6 parts in 105 .\nThe precession of gyroscopes according to general relativity was first calculated independently by Pugh and by\nSchiff [4, 5, 6], who calculated the precession relative to\na given inertial coordinate system. Wilkins [7] analysed\nthe precession in more detail, attempting in particular\nto ascertain how much of the geodetic effect could be regarded as Thomas precession and how much was due to\nthe curvature of space. He was also the first to attempt\na more-or-less coordinate-free calculation by comparing\nthe spin directions with the directions of incoming light\nrays from distant sources.\nRecent discussions of gyroscope precession generally\nfall into three groups. One group provides formal calculations of the precession of a gyroscope relative to a local\ntetrad or congruence of geodesics, sometimes with applications to specific spacetimes such as Schwarzschild,\nKerr, or de Sitter [8, 9, 10, 11, 12], but seldom refers\nto specific aspects of Gravity Probe-B. Another group\nmakes coordinate-dependent calculations of specific precession terms (generally in the post-Newtonian approximation), and discusses details of the various terms, frequently with reference to Gravity Probe-B [13, 14, 15,\n16]. This group also includes unpublished calculations\nby the GP-B team in the course of developing the data\nanalysis procedures for the experiment. A third group\nmixes calculations of precessions referred to a formal\ntetrad (sometimes including comparisons with the direction to a distant star) with applications to Gravity\nProbe-B; these include the standard textbook presentations [17, 18, 19, 20, 21], as well as papers designed in\npart to sort out the meaning of the various precession\nterms \u2013 geodetic, frame-dragging and Thomas precession\n[7, 22].\nTo date, we know of no calculation that, on the one\nhand, takes a fully covariant approach, and that on the\nother hand, incorporates critical operational aspects of\nthe GP-B experiment, and performs an end-to-end calculation in terms of observable quantities. Such a covariant calculation is of interest for several reasons. It\nwould verify that this specific spacecraft experiment is\nactually measuring the observable general relativistic effects it claims to be measuring. In addition, the effects of\naberration are of order v/c and are not relativistic (they\ndepend only on the finite propagation velocity of light),\nhowever they are subject to relativistic corrections which\nare of order (v/c)2 , comparable to the two general rel-\n\nativistic effects being measured. They should therefore\nbe accounted for in a manner that does not depend on\ncoordinates.\nWe have carried out such a calculation. In Section II,\nwe set up an orthonormal basis of vectors tied to the\nrolling spacecraft and use them to characterize the measurable components of the gyroscope spins as read by\ncurrent loops and SQUIDs on board. Section III deals\nwith the incoming light from the guide star and incorporates the effects of spacecraft pointing on the spacecraft\nbasis vectors. In Section IV we calculate the aberration\nand relativistic effects on the observed spin components\nusing the parametrized post-Newtonian framework in an\nEarth-fixed reference frame. Section IV discusses the various effects and estimates their magnitudes, and Section\nV gives concluding remarks. We use the conventions of\n[19] and units in which G = c = 1.\nII.\n\nSPACECRAFT BASIS VECTORS AND\nGYROSCOPE SPINS\n\nWe consider a spacecraft with four-velocity u, whose\norientation is described by three spacelike basis vectors\northogonal to u that are rigidly tied to the spacecraft\n[23]. The vector \u03be points along the spacecraft symmetry axis, while \u03c1 and \u03b7 are orthogonal to \u03be and to each\nother. These four vectors e\u03b1 form an orthonormal basis,\nwith e\u03b1 * e\u03b2 = \u03b7\u03b1\u03b2 , where \u03b7\u03b1\u03b2 is the Minkowski metric,\nvalid in the local inertial frame of the orbiting spacecraft. The spacecraft moves on a geodesic (we ignore atmospheric drag and translational attitude control forces),\nwith \u2207u u = 0. Because the spacecraft is rotating about\nits symmetry axis, it acts as a gyroscope, so that its spin\naxis \u03be is parallel transported, except for attitude-control\nforces that keep the telescope pointed toward the guide\nstar, so that \u2207u \u03be = t, where t denotes the effect of those\nforces on \u03be [24]. This, together with the orthonormality\nof the basis and the geodesic equation, are sufficient to\nestablish that\n\u2207u \u03b7 = \u03c9\u03c1 \u2212 (\u03b7 * t)\u03be ,\n\u2207u \u03c1 = \u2212\u03c9\u03b7 \u2212 (\u03c1 * t)\u03be ,\n\n(1)\n\n\u03c9 \u2261 \u03c1 * \u2207u \u03b7 = \u2212\u03b7 * \u2207u \u03c1\n\n(2)\n\nwhere\n\nis the locally measured roll angular frequency Rof the\nspacecraft. Defining the spacecraft roll phase \u03b8 \u2261 \u03c9d\u03c4 ,\nwhere \u03c4 is spacecraft proper time, we define \"fixed\" roll\nreference axes which do not rotate with the spacecraft:\n\u03b7 0 \u2261 \u03b7 cos \u03b8 \u2212 \u03c1 sin \u03b8 ,\n\u03c10 \u2261 \u03b7 sin \u03b8 + \u03c1 cos \u03b8 .\n\n(3)\n\nThe initial phase is chosen so that one of the vectors\n(\u03b7 0 ) points orthogonal to the plane of the polar orbit, or\nin the East-West (EW) direction, while the other (\u03c10 ) lies\n\n\f3\nIII.\n\nGuide star\n\n\u2605\n\n\u03bb\n\nTELESCOPE POINTING\n\nThe spacecraft is oriented so that the optical axis of the\ntelescope is aligned parallel to the direction of an incoming photon from the guide star. Let \u03bb be the null tangent\nvector to the incoming photon satisfying the geodesic\nequation \u2207\u03bb \u03bb = 0 with \u03bb * \u03bb = 0. In the spacecraft\nframe, the direction of the incoming photon is given by\na unit normalized spatial vector which is the projection\nof \u03bb onto the spacecraft basis, namely\n\n\u03c10 (NS)\n\n\u03be\n\u03b70 (EW)\n\n\u03bb\u0302 =\n\n\u03bb\n\u2212 u.\n(\u2212u * \u03bb)\n\n(6)\n\nThen, using Eqs. (4) the equations of motion for the\nroll-fixed components of \u03bb\u0302 are given by\n(d/d\u03c4 )\u03bb\u0302\u03b70 = \u01eb1/2 (\u2207u \u03bb\u0302) * \u03b7 0 \u2212 t\u03b70 \u03bb\u0302\u03be ,\n(d/d\u03c4 )\u03bb\u0302\u03c10 = \u01eb1/2 (\u2207u \u03bb\u0302) * \u03c10 \u2212 t\u03c10 \u03bb\u0302\u03be ,\n(d/d\u03c4 )\u03bb\u0302\u03be = \u01eb1/2 (\u2207u \u03bb\u0302) * \u03be + t\u03b70 \u03bb\u0302\u03b70 + t\u03c10 \u03bb\u0302\u03c10 , (7)\n\nFIG. 1: Basis four-vectors for Gravity Probe-B\n\nin the orbital plane, or the North-South (NS) direction\n(see Fig. 1). The orbital plane is chosen so that the guide\nstar, and hence the vector \u03be, lie in the plane. (The guide\nstar HR 8703 is at declination 16.84o and right ascension\n343.26o.) Then one can show that these roll-fixed vectors\nevolve according to\n\u2207u \u03b7 0 = \u2212(\u03b7 0 * t)\u03be ,\n\u2207u \u03c10 = \u2212(\u03c10 * t)\u03be ,\n\u2207u \u03be = t ,\n\n(4)\n\nwhere we have used the fact that t * u = 0.\nEach gyroscope is characterized by a spin four-vector S\nthat is purely spatial in the spacecraft frame (S * u = 0);\nthis amounts to a specific choice of its center of mass.\nWe assume that gyro torques are sufficiently small that\nwe can treat the gyros as perfect, so that S is parallel\ntransported (\u2207u S = 0). Then the rate of change of\neach component of S on the roll-fixed basis is given by\nd(S * e\u03b1 )/d\u03c4 = S * \u2207u e\u03b1 ; combining with Eqs. (4) we\nobtain the equation of motion for the spin components,\n\u1e60\u03b70 = \u2212t\u03b70 S\u03be ,\n\nt\u03b70 = \u01eb1/2 \u03bb\u0302\u22121\n\u03be (\u2207u \u03bb\u0302) * \u03b7 0 + \u03b4(\u2206t\u03b70 ) ,\nt\u03c10 = \u01eb1/2 \u03bb\u0302\u22121\n\u03be (\u2207u \u03bb\u0302) * \u03c10 + \u03b4(\u2206t\u03c10 ) ,\n\n(8)\n\nwhere \u2206t\u03b70 and \u2206t\u03c10 are the roll-fixed components of the\norder-\u03b4 residual \"pointing error\" and dithering torques.\nSubstituting Eqs. (8) back into Eqs. (7), and using\nthe fact that \u03bb\u0302 is a normalized vector, we find that\n(d/d\u03c4 )\u03bb\u0302\u03b70 = \u2212\u03b4(\u2206t\u03b70 )\u03bb\u0302\u03be , (d/d\u03c4 )\u03bb\u0302\u03c10 = \u2212\u03b4(\u2206t\u03c10 )\u03bb\u0302\u03be , and\n(d/d\u03c4 )\u03bb\u0302\u03be = \u03b4(\u2206t\u03b70 \u03bb\u0302\u03b70 + \u2206t\u03c10 \u03bb\u0302\u03c10 ). From these equations\nwe obtain\n\u03bb\u0302\u03b70 (\u03c4 ) = O(\u03b4) , \u03bb\u0302\u03c10 (\u03c4 ) = O(\u03b4) , \u03bb\u0302\u03be (\u03c4 ) = \u22121+O(\u03b4 2 ) . (9)\n\n\u1e60\u03c10 = \u2212t\u03c10 S\u03be ,\n\u1e60\u03be = t\u03b70 S\u03b70 + t\u03c10 S\u03c10 ,\n\nwhere we have introduced the small parameter \u01eb1/2 \u223c\n(v/c) to characterize the leading effects on \u2207u \u03bb\u0302, namely\naberration.\nIn the operation of the experiment, attitude control\nforces orient the spacecraft so that the telescope always\npoints toward the apparent location of the guide star, i.e.\nso that \u03bb\u0302 = \u2212\u03be, or so that \u03bb\u0302*\u03c10 = \u03bb\u0302*\u03b7 0 = 0. This will be\nonly approximately true because of pointing errors and\noccasional deliberate \"dithering\" of the spacecraft for operational and other reasons; these errors are expected to\nbe on the level of a few to tens of mas. We introduce the\nsmall parameter \u03b4 \u223c 10\u22127 to characterize these pointing\nerrors. Then to drive \u03bb\u0302\u03c10 and \u03bb\u0302\u03b70 and their time derivatives to zero, we require attitude control torques given,\nfrom Eqs. (7), by\n\n(5)\n\nwhere S\u03b70 = S * \u03b70 S\u03c10 = S * \u03c10 , and S\u03be = S * \u03be, with\nparallel definitions for t\u03b70 , etc., and where overdot denotes d/d\u03c4 . In the absence of torques on the spacecraft\n(t = 0), \u1e60\u03b70 = \u1e60\u03c10 = \u1e60\u03be = 0, as expected, since the gyro\nspins and spacecraft basis vectors will undergo identical\ntransports through spacetime.\n\nThen substituting Eqs. (8) into (5), we obtain\n\u1e60\u03b70 = \u2212\u01eb1/2 (S\u03be /\u03bb\u0302\u03be )(\u2207u \u03bb\u0302) * \u03b7 0 \u2212 \u03b4(\u2206t\u03b70 )S\u03be ,\n\u1e60\u03c10 = \u2212\u01eb1/2 (S\u03be /\u03bb\u0302\u03be )(\u2207u \u03bb\u0302) * \u03c10 \u2212 \u03b4(\u2206t\u03c10 )S\u03be ,\n\u1e60\u03be = \u01eb1/2 [S\u03b70 (\u2207u \u03bb\u0302) * \u03b7 0 + S\u03c10 (\u2207u \u03bb\u0302) * \u03c10 ]\u03bb\u0302\u22121\n\u03be\n+\u03b4(\u2206t\u03b70 S\u03b70 + \u2206t\u03c10 S\u03c10 ) .\n\n(10)\n\n\f4\nBut since S\u03b70 \u223c S\u03c10 \u223c \u01eb1/2 + \u03b4, we have \u1e60\u03be \u223c \u01eb + \u01eb1/2 \u03b4 +\n\u03b4 2 +. . ., and so, choosing the vector S to be normalized to\nunity (under parallel transport it has constant norm), we\ncan write S\u03be = 1 + O(\u01eb, \u01eb1/2 \u03b4, \u03b4 2 ). Substituting into Eq.\n(10), we obtain our final equation for the evolution of the\ngyro spin components relative to the roll-fixed spacecraft\naxes,\n\u1e60\u03b70 = \u01eb1/2 (\u2207u \u03bb\u0302) * \u03b7 0 \u2212 \u03b4(\u2206t\u03b70 )\n+O(\u01eb3/2 , \u01eb\u03b4, \u01eb1/2 \u03b4 2 ) ,\n\u1e60\u03c10 = \u01eb1/2 (\u2207u \u03bb\u0302) * \u03c10 \u2212 \u03b4(\u2206t\u03c10 )\n+O(\u01eb3/2 , \u01eb\u03b4, \u01eb1/2 \u03b4 2 ) .\n\n(11)\n\nThese physically measurable components S\u03b70 and S\u03c10\ntranslate directly into outputs of the SQUID magnetometers. The expressions are generally covariant, and thus\nmay be evaluated in any chosen coordinate system.\nInterestingly, in this picture all the relativistic effects\narise mathematically from the covariant derivative of the\nincoming photon world line along the spacecraft fourvelocity, and not in the precessions of the gyroscope spins.\nThis is because we have chosen the rolling spacecraft itself to define our basis; this was a natural choice because\nall the measuring instruments (current loops, SQUIDs)\nare rigidly fixed to the spacecraft. But since a rolling\nspacecraft is itself a gyroscope, it and the superconducting gyros precess together in the spacetime around the\nEarth. Hence, in this basis, the relativistic effects appear to originate elsewhere. The superconducting gyros\nare still crucial, of course, because, by design, they are\ncloser to being perfect gyros, and thus are less affected\nby anomalous torques. Here the spacecraft plays a role\nsimilar to that of an oscillator clock that is slaved to an\nultraprecise atomic standard (such as a hydrogen maser,\nor atom fountain clock); the oscillator may drift or be\ndeliberately steered from time to time, but its phase can\nalways be linked precisely back to the underlying standard. Similarly, while the spacecraft \"gyro\" is steered\nto follow the guide star as the star's apparent location\nvaries because of aberration and relativistic effects, the\nspacecraft axis direction is precisely linked to the superconducting gyros via the output of the SQUIDS.\nWe now turn to the relativistic and aberration effects\nthat are being measured.\nIV. POST-NEWTONIAN CALCULATION OF\nMEASURABLE RELATIVISTIC EFFECTS\n\nWe evaluate the quantity \u2207u \u03bb\u0302 in the post-Newtonian\napproximation using the parametrized post-Newtonian\n(PPN) framework [19]. The metric of spacetime in the\nsolar-system rest-frame is taken to have the form\ng00 = \u22121 + 2U + O(\u01eb2 ) ,\n1\ng0i = \u2212(2 + 2\u03b3 + \u03b11 )Vi + O(\u01eb5/2 ) ,\n2\ngij = (1 + 2\u03b3U )\u03b4ij + O(\u01eb2 ) ,\n\n(12)\n\nwhere \u03b3 and \u03b11 are PPN parameters whose values depend\non the theory of gravity, and where we have restricted attention to theories of gravity with suitable global conservation laws, and have ignored \"preferred-frame\" terms in\nthe metric (see [19], \u00a79.1 for discussion of these effects).\nWe have used a gauge analogous to harmonic gauge, instead of the conventional PPN gauge (see [19] \u00a74.2 for\ndiscussion). For an orbiting, rotating, nearly spherical\nEarth, and a static, spherically symmetric Sun, the potentials U and V have the form\nU = M\u2299 /r + M\u2295 /R ,\n1\nV = M\u2295 v\u2295 /R \u2212 X \u00d7 J\u2295 /R3 ,\n2\n\n(13)\n\nwhere M\u2299 is the mass of the Sun, M\u2295 , v\u2295 and J\u2295 are\nthe mass, velocity and angular momentum of the Earth;\nX = x\u2212x\u2295 and R = |X| denote the satellite-Earth vector\nand distance, while x and r = |x| denote the satellite-Sun\nvector and distance. In fact, the quadrupole moment of\nthe Earth has a measurable effect on the geodetic precession and must be included; as this has been treated\nthoroughly elsewhere [7, 15, 16, 25] we will ignore it here.\nFrom the geodesic equation for photons, d\u03bbi /dt +\n(\u0393i\u03bc\u03bd \u2212 \u03930\u03bc\u03bd \u03bbi )\u03bb\u03bc \u03bb\u03bd = 0, where \u03bb\u03bc = dx\u03bc /dt, we obtain\nthe solution (see [19] \u00a77.1 for details):\n\u03bb0 = 1 ,\n\u03bbi = ni [1 \u2212 (1 + \u03b3)U ] + Di + O(\u01eb3/2 ) ,\n\n(14)\n\nwhere ni is a Cartesian unit vector describing the initial\ndirection of the photon far from the Earth in the global\nPPN coordinate system, and Di represents the deflection\nof the ray, obtained by solving the equation\n\u0012 i\u0013\ndD\n= (1 + \u03b3)[\u2207i U \u2212 ni (n * \u2207U )] .\n(15)\ndt along ni\nThe unit vector n points from the source toward the\nspacecraft, and hence may be written n = n0 + x * \u2207n0 +\n. . ., where n0 is a constant unit vector toward the solarsystem barycenter and where \u2207i nj0 = (\u03b4 ij \u2212 ni0 nj0 )/D,\nwhere D is the distance from the solar-system barycenter to the guide star. The correction term accounts for\nthe parallax of the guide star; for HR 8703 it amounts to\nabout 10 mas \u223c 3 \u00d7 10\u22127 . Because it is so small, we will\ntreat it as effectively a pointing error term, of order \u03b4.\nLetting the spacecraft have ordinary velocity v i =\ni\nu /u0 , where u0 = 1 + v 2 /2 + U + O(\u01eb2 ), we find that the\ncomponents of \u03bb\u0302 are given by\n\u03bb\u03020 = n * v \u2212 [v 2 \u2212 (n * v)2 ] + O(\u01eb3/2 ) ,\n\u03bb\u0302i = ni \u2212 [v i \u2212 ni (n * v)] + ni [(n * v)2 \u2212 v 2 /2 \u2212 \u03b3U ]\n+Di + O(\u01eb3/2 ) .\n\n(16)\n\nTo calculate the covariant quantities (\u2207u \u03bb\u0302) * \u03b7 0 and\n(\u2207u \u03bb\u0302) * \u03c10 in Eqs. (11), it suffices to evaluate them in\nthe PPN coordinate system. We first evaluate (\u2207u \u03bb\u0302)\u03b1 =\n\n\f5\nCalculating the Christoffel symbols from the\nu\u03b2 \u03bb\u0302\u03b1\n;\u03b2 .\nmetric (12) to the needed order, and using the fact\nthat dU/dt = \u2202U/\u2202t + v * \u2207U , and, by virtue of the\nequation of motion dv/dt = \u2207U , that (v * n)\u2207U =\n1/2{d[v(v * n)]/dt + n \u00d7 (\u2207U \u00d7 v)}, we find\n(\u2207u \u03bb\u0302)0 = O(v\u2207U ) ,\n\u0014\nd\ni\n(\u2207u \u03bb\u0302) =\n(x * \u2207)ni0 \u2212 v i + ni (n * v)\ndt\n\u0015\n1 i\n1 2\ni\ni\n2\n+n {(n * v) \u2212 v } \u2212 v (n * v) + D\n2\n2\n1\n+ (2\u03b3 + 1)[n \u00d7 (v \u00d7 \u2207U )]i\n2\n1\n+(1 + \u03b3 + \u03b11 )[n \u00d7 (\u2207 \u00d7 V)]i\n4\n+O(U \u2207U ) ,\n(17)\nwhere, to the order needed, we can convert from spacecraft proper time \u03c4 to PPN coordinate time t.\nWe also need to determine the time dependence of \u03b7 0\nand \u03c10 ; even though they are roll-fixed vectors, they\nwill vary slightly because of pointing of the spacecraft\nto maintain alignment with the guide star. However, because \u2207u \u03bb\u0302 is already of O(\u01eb1/2 ), we only need to evaluate\n\u03b7 0 and \u03c10 to O(\u01eb1/2 ), which means accounting only for\nthe effects of aberration-induced torques. Substituting\nEqs. (8) into (4), and using the fact that \u03be, \u03c10 , \u03b7 0 , and\nu form an orthonormal tetrad, we obtain\n\u2207u \u03b7 0 = \u01eb1/2 \u2207u \u03bb\u0302 * \u03b7 0 \u03be + O(\u03b4) ,\n\u2207u \u03c10 = \u01eb1/2 \u2207u \u03bb\u0302 * \u03c10 \u03be + O(\u03b4) ,\n\u2207u \u03be = \u01eb1/2 (\u2212\u2207u \u03bb\u0302 + \u2207u \u03bb\u0302 * uu + \u2207u \u03bb\u0302 * \u03be\u03be)\n+O(\u03b4) .\n(18)\nWe use the fact that, for each of these three vectors, (\u2207u e(\u03b1) )\u03b2 = de\u03b2(\u03b1) /d\u03c4 + \u0393\u03b2\u03b3\u03b4 e\u03b3(\u03b1) u\u03b4 , substitute the\nChristoffel symbols and Eqs. (17), and integrate, to obtain\n(\u03b70 )0 (t)\n(\u03b70 )i (t)\n(\u03c10 )0 (t)\n(\u03c10 )i (t)\n\u03be 0 (t)\n\u03be i (t)\n\n=\n=\n=\n=\n=\n=\n\nv * \u03b7\u03040 + O(\u01eb, \u03b4) ,\n(\u03b7\u03040 )i \u2212 v * \u03b7\u03040 \u03be\u0304 i + O(\u01eb, \u03b4) ,\nv * \u03c1\u03040 + O(\u01eb, \u03b4) ,\n(\u03c1\u03040 )i \u2212 v * \u03c1\u03040 \u03be \u0304i + O(\u01eb, \u03b4) ,\nv * \u03be\u0304 + O(\u01eb, \u03b4) ,\n\u03be \u0304i + v i \u2212 \u03be\u0304 i v * \u03be \u0304 + O(\u01eb, \u03b4) ,\n\n(19)\n\n\u0012\n\n1\nv * \u03b7\u03040 v * \u03be\u0304 + H * \u03b7\u03040 + D * \u03b7\u03040\n2\n\n\u0013\n\n+\u03b4(D\u22121 x * \u03b7\u03040 \u2212 T\u03b70 )\n+O(\u01eb3/2 , \u01eb\u03b4, \u01eb1/2 \u03b4 2 ) ,\nS\u03c10 = S\u03c10 (0) \u2212 \u01eb1/2 v * \u03c1\u03040\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1\n \u0304\nv * \u03c1\u03040 v * \u03be + H * \u03c1\u03040 + D * \u03c1\u03040\n+\u01eb\n2\n+\u03b4(D\u22121 x * \u03c1\u03040 \u2212 T\u03c10 )\n+O(\u01eb3/2 , \u01eb\u03b4, \u01eb1/2 \u03b4 2 ) .\n\n(20)\n\nThe first term in Eqs. (20) is the initial misalignment of\nthe spin with the spacecraft axis, which is expected to\nbe smaller than one arcsecond. The next term, of order\n\u01eb1/2 , and the first of the O(\u01eb) terms, are the aberration\nterm and its relativistic correction. The term involving\nH is the integrated relativistic\nR t precession projected onto\n\u03b7\u03040 and \u03c1\u03040 , given by H = (dH/dt)dt, where dH/dt is\nthe precession rate given by\ndH\n1\n1\n= \u2212 (2\u03b3 +1)\u03be\u0304\u00d7(v\u00d7\u2207U )\u2212(1+\u03b3 + \u03b11 )\u03be\u0304 \u00d7(\u2207\u00d7V) .\ndt\n2\n4\n(21)\nThe terms D * \u03b7\u03040 and D * \u03c1\u03040 in Eqs. (20) denote the contribution of the deflection of light. The O(\u03b4) terms T\u03b70\nand T\u03c10 denote the integrated angular offset caused by\npointing errors, while the terms D\u22121 x * \u03b7\u03040 and D\u22121 x * \u03c1\u03040\ndenote the effects of parallax. The spatial vectors defined\nin Eqs. (20) are referred to the solar-system-fixed PPN\ncoordinate system. However, to the order needed, we\ncan write v = v\u2295 + vs + O(\u01eb3/2 ), where v\u2295 is the Earth's\norbital velocity relative to the Sun, and vs is the spacecraft's velocity relative to the Earth. Furthermore, the\ncomponents of the various 3-vectors in the solar-system\nbasis are equal to the respective components in a nonrotating Earth-comoving basis, apart from corrections of\norder \u01eb; hence to the order needed in Eqs. (20) we can\ntreat all spatial vectors as defined in the geocentric basis.\n\nV.\n\nwhere \u03b7\u03040 , \u03c1\u03040 and \u03be\u0304 are spatial 3-vectors in the PPN frame\nthat describe the orientation of the spacecraft at a chosen initial moment of time. They are orthonormal in the\nCartesian sense to O(\u01eb). We have used the fact, obtainable from Eq. (9), that n = \u2212\u03be\u0304 + O(\u01eb, \u03b4), n * \u03b7\u03040 = O(\u01eb, \u03b4)\nand n * \u03c1\u03040 = O(\u01eb, \u03b4).\nSubstituting Eqs. (17) and (19) into (11), converting\nfrom d/d\u03c4 to d/dt using the property that \u03c4 = t[1+O(\u01eb)],\nand integrating with respect to t, we obtain, finally\nS\u03b70 = S\u03b70 (0) \u2212 \u01eb1/2 v * \u03b7\u03040\n\n+\u01eb\n\nDISCUSSION OF RELATIVISTIC EFFECTS\n\nThe first non-constant term in Eqs. (20) is the aberration of starlight, consisting of both an annual aberration\nwith amplitude of v\u2295 \u223c 20 arcseconds, and an orbital\naberration with amplitude vs \u223c 5 arcseconds. But because the position of the guide star can be determined\nfrom VLBI and the orbit of the earth and spacecraft can\nbe determined from the ephemeris and GPS to high accuracy, these terms may be predicted to an accuracy better than that needed to measure the relativistic effects.\nFurthermore, their variation with time over a year can\nbe separated from the variation of the relativistic terms,\nhence the aberration can be used to determine the \"scale\nfactor\" that relates the output of the SQUIDs (the actual data) to the desired angles S\u03b70 and S\u03c10 . The second term in Eqs. (20) is the relativistic correction to\n\n\f6\naberration, whose orbital part dominates, with ampli2\ntude 12 v\u2295\nsin \u03b2 \u223c 0.4 mas (\u03b2 is the ecliptic latitude of the\nguide star), which is comparable to the accuracy goal of\nthe experiment; this term must be included in the data\nanalysis [26]. Terms of order v\u2295 vs and vs2 and terms cubic\nin v can be ignored.\nFor the relativistic precession terms, dH/dt can be separated into various contributions using Eqs. (13):\n\u001a\ndH\n1\nM\u2295\nM\u2299\n1\n=\n(2 + \u03b11 ) 3 v\u2295 \u00d7 X \u2212 (2\u03b3 + 1) 3 vs \u00d7 x\ndt\n4\nR\n2\nr\n1\n1\nM\u2299\nM\u2295\n\u2212 (2\u03b3 + 1) 3 v\u2295 \u00d7 x \u2212 (2\u03b3 + 1) 3 vs \u00d7 X\n2\nr\n2\nR\n\u0015\u001b\n\u0014\n1\n1\nJ\u2295 \u2212 3NJ\u2295 * N\n\u00d7 \u03be\u0304 , (22)\n\u2212 (\u03b3 + 1 + \u03b11 )\n2\n4\nR3\nwhere N = X/R. Since H and \u03be\u0304 both refer to the direction of the spins, this equation has the general form\ndS/dt = \u03a9\u00d7 S, so that the quantity in braces in Eq. (22)\ncan be regarded as the precession rate vector.\nThe first two terms produce periodic contributions to\nthe signal at the frequencies \u03c9s \u00b1\u03c9\u2295 , where \u03c9s and \u03c9\u2295 \u226a\n\u03c9s are the orbital angular frequencies of the spacecraft\nand Earth, respectively. Integrated over time, these contribute periodic terms at approximately the orbital frequency with amplitudes of v\u2295 M\u2295 /2R2 \u03c9s \u223c v\u2295 vs /2 \u223c 0.3\n2\nmas and vs M\u2299 /r2 \u03c9s \u223c v\u2295\n(R/r) \u223c 10\u22124 mas, respectively. Averaged over time, these are negligible.\nThe third term may be evaluated to sufficient accuracy\nat the center of the Earth rather than at the satellite;\ntreating the Earth's orbit as circular yields a signal that\n2\n \u0304 \u223c 19\ngrows at the constant rate of (3/2)v\u2295\n\u03c9\u2295 (h \u00d7 \u03be)\nmas/yr in a direction perpendicular to h, the normal to\nthe ecliptic plane [7, 27]. This term is the solar geodetic\neffect (sometimes called the de Sitter precession); it is\nresponsible for an analogous precession in the lunar orbit\nthat has been measured to around 0.7 % using Lunar\nlaser ranging [28].\nThe fourth term is the main geodetic effect, at the\n \u0304 \u223c 6600 mas/yr, in a\nconstant rate of (3/2)vs2 \u03c9s (h\u2032 \u00d7 \u03be)\ndirection perpendicular to h\u2032 , the normal to the orbital\nplane. Note that if \u03b7\u03040 is chosen to be the EW basis vector,\nwhich is perpendicular to the polar orbit, then the main\ngeodetic effect does not appear in the output S\u03b70 , in other\nwords it produces a purely S\u03c10 , or NS signal. There is\nan additional contribution to this precession arising from\nthe Earth's oblateness at about 7 mas/yr, which must be\ntaken into account [7, 15, 16, 25, 29, 30]\nThe final term in Eq. (22) is the Lense-Thirring or\nframe-dragging effect. It has both a constant term and a\nperiodic term at twice the orbital frequency, but for a circular polar orbit, it produces an orbit-averaged constant\n3\n \u0304\nrate of J\u2295 \u00d7 \u03be/2R\n= J\u2295 cos \u03b4/2R3 \u223c 41 cos \u03b4 mas/yr,\nwhere \u03b4 is the declination of the guide star. If the plane\nof the polar orbit is oriented so that the guide star location is in the orbital plane, then the signal is purely S\u03b70 ,\nor EW.\nThe next term in Eqs. (20) is the deflection of light.\n\nFor the ecliptic latitude of the guide star, this gives a\nmaximum deflection caused by the Sun of around 20 mas,\nonce in the one-year mission. This effect can be included\nas a term to be estimated in the data analysis \u2013 studies\nby the GP-B team indicate that it could be measured\nto about one percent \u2013 or it can calculated a priori using general relativity and the known parameters of the\nEarth's orbit and the guide star location. Because the\nguide star will be occulted by the Earth, the Earth will\nalso contribute a once-per-orbit deflection of around 0.5\nmas (which will compete with deflection caused by propagation of the signal through the Earth's atmosphere).\nBecause it averages to zero, this effect can be ignored.\nThese relativistic terms, geodetic precession, frame\ndragging and deflection of light, have been calculated using the specific assumptions and constraints inherent in\nthe PPN framework. An alternative, more phenomenological viewpoint, would be to regard each as an independent effect with a separate phenomenological parameter\nto be measured in the data analysis.\nThe remaining terms in Eqs. (20) are of order \u03b4. The\nparallax term caused by the Earth's motion (around 10\nmas) must be taken into account, while that due to the\nsatellite's orbit is negligible. Finally the pointing error\nterms will be controlled to better than 20 mas (rms), and\nin any event will be measured directly by the telescope;\nall that is needed then is a sufficiently accurate calibration (via deliberate dithering of the spacecraft axis by\nknown amounts) to convert telescope readout signals to\nthe appropriate contributions T\u03b70 and T\u03c10 to S\u03b70 and S\u03c10 .\n\nVI.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nWe have carried out a covariant calculation of the\nmeasurable output of an orbiting gyroscope experiment,\nand shown that the result may be expressed in terms\nof contributions that can be calculated consistently using an Earth-based coordinate frame. The dominant\ncontributions that are detectable within the stated 0.4\nmas/yr accuracy of the GB-P mission are: the aberration of starlight and its special relativistic correction, the\ngeneral relativistic geodetic precession (due both to the\nEarth and to the Sun) and the general relativistic framedragging. The results are in agreement with other, noncovariant calculations, including numerous unpublished\ncalculations and simulations carried out by the GP-B\nteam in the course of developing the data analysis sytem\nfor the mission. Because all measurements are referred to\ninstruments fixed on a rolling spacecraft, the measurable\nrelativistic effects enter mathematically via their effect on\nthe apparent direction of the light from the guide star.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nWe are grateful to Mac Keiser, Francis Everitt and\nAlex Silbergleit for useful discussions, and for important\n\n\f7\ninsights into the nature of the GP-B experiment, and to\nCharles Pellerin for suggesting the calculation.

In practice this is determined using a pair of star-trackers fixed to the spacecraft platform directed roughly perpendicular to the roll\naxis, that continually compare the spacecraft orientation\nto a library of known stellar positions, and provide a\nphase accurate to a few arcseconds. The angle \u03b8 is the ac-\n\n[1] C. W. F. Everitt, in Near Zero: New Frontiers of Physics,\nedited by J. D. Fairbank, B. S. Deaver, Jr., C. W. F.\nEveritt and P. F.

It will record a star when the incoming\nprojected world line of the photon is anti-parallel to \u03b7.\ni.e. when \u03b7 \u2032 = \u2212\u03bb\u0302 = \u2212n + v \u2212 nn * v. In the absence\nof spacecraft motion, we would have \u03b7 = \u2212n. If \u03b8\u2032 is\nthe measured roll phase and \u03b8 is the \"true\" roll-phase\n(without aberration), then\ncos \u03b8\u2032 = \u03b7 \u2032 * \u03b7 0\n= cos \u03b8 + v * \u03c1 sin \u03b8 ,\n\n(A.2)\n\nhence \u2206\u03b8 = v * \u03c1 = v * \u03c10 cos \u03b8 \u2212 v * \u03b70 sin \u03b8. But since\nS\u03b70 = S\u03b70 (0) \u2212 \u01eb1/2 v * \u03b7\u03040 + O(\u01eb, \u03b4), with a parallel expression for S\u03c10 , the product S\u03b70 \u2206\u03b8 is of magnitude at most\n10\u22128 \u223c 2 mas, but most importantly is periodic at the\nroll frequency, and averages to zero.
