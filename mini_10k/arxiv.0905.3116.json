However, the existence of a big bang\nsingularity in the early universe is still an unresolved problem. Some authors have tried\nto address this problem within the framework of quantum gravity and have suggested\nsome models to avoid this singularity, such as the pre-big bang [2, 3] and ekpyrotic/cyclic\nscenarios [4] in string/M-theory, but it still remains unclear as to what process could lead\nto a nonsingular transition from the pre- to post big bang phase.\nRecently, in order to establish a singularity-free inflationary model in the context of\nclassical general relativity, a new scenario, an emergent universe [5, 6], has been proposed.\nIn this model, the space curvature is positive and the universe stays past-eternally in an\nEinstein static state and then evolves into a subsequent inflationary phase. Thus the big\nbang singularity can be avoided. In addition, researches show that the entropy considerations favor the Einstein static state as the initial state of our universe [7]. However\nthe Einstein static universe in the classical general relativity is unstable. Therefore the\nuniverse is extremely difficult to maintain such an initial static state in a long time due\nto the existence of perturbations, such as the quantum fluctuations.\nMore recently, the emergent model within the framework of quantum gravity has been\nstudied extensively. In this regard, Mulryne et al. [8] studied the existence and stability\nof Einstein static state in the context of Loop Quantum Cosmology (LQC) [9, 10] with\nthe inflaton scalar field modified by the inverse volume corrections in Loop Quantum\nGravity (LQG) (see [11] for recent reviews), where LQC is an application to cosmology\nof LQG. The inverse volume is the cube of inverse scale factor and in LQC the correction\nto the inverse volume arises by exploiting the ambiguity in defining the inverse volume\noperator which is required to quantize the Hamiltonian constraint [12]. It was found that\nthere is a center equilibrium point in the semiclassical region besides a saddle point in\nthe classical region. If the potential energy of scalar field is less than a critical value, the\nuniverse can stay past-eternally at a static state and then enter into an oscillating phase\n\n2\n\n\fwith the scalar field being driven up its potential [13]. As a result, once the potential\nreaches this critical value, the center equilibrium point coincides with the saddle one,\nand the oscillating phase is broken and then the universe enters an inflation era. Thus\na successful singularity-free inflation model is obtained. However in Ref. [8], the author\ndid not consider the inverse volume correction to the gravity, which seems to be adhoc. The reason is that the same ambiguity also arises in the gravitational part of the\nHamiltonian constraint. Therefore the inverse volume correction to the gravity should\nbe considered, which may change the dynamics significantly. For the case of the LQC\nwithout the inverse volume modification, although there is also a new stable center if the\ncosmological constant is larger than a critical scale, the universe cannot break the infinite\ncycles around this center point to naturally enter a subsequent inflationary phase [14].\nThus it will be interesting to study the emergent inflation in LQC with the inverse volume\ncorrections both to matter and gravity. In addition Lidsey and Mulryne [15] studied the\ndynamics of a scalar field within the context of branewold scenario proposed by Shtanov\nand Sahni [16, 17] and found that, with the scalar field climbing up its potential, the\ncosmic evolution from the past eternal cycle to inflation can occur naturally as in the\ncase of LQC with the scalar field modification. Later, modified stabilities of the Einstein\nstatic model in some non-Einstein gravities [18] have also been discussed.\nIn this paper, we will discuss an emergent inflation in LQC with the inverse volume\ncorrections to both the matter and gravity. A tachyon scalar field is considered since it\nhas a non-canonical kinetic term and has attracted considerable attention for the cosmic\ninflation at early times and for dark energy and dark matter at late times [19]. In the\nframework of LQC the tachyon inflation has been studied in the cases of the matter with\nor without the inverse volume correction and results showed that the super inflation can\nappear easily in both cases [20, 21].\n\nII.\n\nTACHYON IN LQC\n\nIn a positively curved Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) background, following the\ncalculations in Refs.

Therefore in the following we will only consider the critical point \u03c1\u03c6 =\n\n3S\n.\n\u03baa2\n\nFrom Eq.

Using Eq. (6) at the equilibrium point we\nfind\nd ln S\n2 3 3 d ln q \u2212 1\n\u03c6\u0307 = p |F |\n.\n9\nB\n2\n\nSince\n\nd ln S\nd ln q\n\n(12)\n\nis smaller than 1 as shown in Fig. (1), the reality condition, \u03c6\u03072 > 0, requires\n\nthat the intersections of functions A and B must appear in the range of B < 0.\nIn Fig. (2) we give the curves of functions A and B. The function A reaches its\nat a = a\u2217 , and\nmaximum Amax = 4 at a = 0, decreases to its minimum Amin = \u2212 11\n6\nthen asymptotes to \u22121 at a \u2192 \u221e. The function B is a hyperbola with a single vertical\nasymptote given by solving V =\n\n3S\n.\n\u03baa2\n\nHowever, from the requirement of \u03c6\u03072 > 0, only\n\nthe down-left branch of this hyperbola plays a role in determining the existence of the\nequilibrium points.\n5\n\n\fIf the potential satisfies the conditions 0 < V < Vcrit where Vcrit =\nq\n2 d ln S\n29\n3S\nobtained from the equation Amin = B, there are two intersects\n+ 4a\n|\n\u03baa2\n33\n33 d ln q a=a\u2217\n\nbetween the curve of A and the down left branch of B. As shown in Fig. (2), one equilib-\n\nrium point occurs at the semiclassical region; the other at the classical region. With the\nincreasing of the potential these two intersects become closer and closer. Once V = Vcrit\nthey coincide with each other and there is only an equilibrium point. In addition, we find\nthat, in order to obtain two intersect points of functions A and B, the kinetic term \u03c6\u03072 of\ntachyon field must satisfy the following constraint\nd ln S \u0001\n4\n< \u03c6\u03072 < a6 |F |3 ,\n|F |3a6 1 \u2212 a2\n33\nd ln q\n\n(13)\n\nwhich comes from the requirement 0 < V < Vcrit . In Fig. (3) we give the allowed region\nof \u03c6\u03072 . From this Figure, we can see that aeq cannot be much smaller than a\u2217 and the\nregion of aeq . 0.7a\u2217 is forbidden.\nIf one obtains the equilibrium points, their stabilities are determined by the eigenvalues coming from linearizing the system near these points. By calculation, we get the\neigenvalue \u03bb2 , but the results are very tedious. We will not give them here. If \u03bb2 < 0 the\ncorresponding equilibrium point is a center otherwise it is a saddle. Since \u03bb2 is positive\nfor a > a\u2217 and negative for a < a\u2217 , as shown in Fig. (4), equilibrium points occurring in\nthe classical region are saddles and those in the semiclassical region are centers. Therefore\nfrom Fig. (2) we obtain that in LQC there is a center equilibrium point in the semiclassical\nregion, which originates from the loop quantum effects, and a saddle point in the classical\nregion, which is similar to the classical general relativity.\nIn Fig. (5) we give the phase portraits for demonstrating the center equilibrium point\nand the saddle point. The separatrix is represented by the dashed line. Apparently if the\nvalue of the potential is less than Vcrit the universe can stay at a stable state past-eternally\nand then undergo an infinite oscillation with the tachyon field climbing up its potential.\nOnce the potential reaches the critical value Vcrit , the oscillating phase is broken and then\nthe universe enters into an inflationary era.\n\n6\n\n\fIII.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nIn summary, in LQC with the inverse volume corrections to the tachyon field and the\ngravity, there are two equilibrium points. The one appearing in the classical region is a\nsaddle point as that in general relativity; the other in semiclassical region is a center which\ncomes from the loop quantum effects. If the potential of tachyon field asymptotes to a\npositive constant and is less than Vcrit as t \u2192 \u2212\u221e, the universe can stay past-eternally at\na stable state. With the tachyon field climbing up its potential slowly, the universe will\nundergo non-singular oscillations around the center equilibrium point. Once the potential\nreaches the critical value Vcrit , the saddle point coincides with the center point and then\nthe cycles are broken by the emergence of an inflation. Thus the universe enters into a de\nSitter expansion phase. In addition we find that, in order to obtain a successful emergent\ntachyon inflation, the allowed region of \u03c6\u03072 at the stable state is constrained. For the\nnormal scalar field the emergent inflation will be studied in the future.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nWe appreciate very much the insightful comments and help suggestions by anonymous\nreferee. P.
