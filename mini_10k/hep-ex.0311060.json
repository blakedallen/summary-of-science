INTRODUCTION\nOne of the important experimental methods to get the information on the changes of\nstates of nuclear matter with increasing its baryon density is to study the characteristics\nof hadron-nuclear and nuclear-nuclear interactions depending on the centrality of collisions (Q) at high energies. There are some results obtained in these experiments for the\ninteractions of \u03c0-mesons, protons and nuclei with nuclei at energies less than SPS' energies which demonstrate existence of the regime changes in these dependencies [1]-[5]. It\nis necessary to note that in different experiments the values of Q are defined in different\nways. Therefore it is very difficult to compare the obtaineed results on Q-dependencies\nin different papers .\nQCD predicts that at high energy density, hadronic matter will turn into plasma of\ndeconfined quarks and gluons [6]. It is expected that the temperature of hadron matter T\nwill be T > Tc \u2243 150 \u2212 200MeV and \u03bcB will be \u03bcB > \u03bcBc (\u03bcB increases with the barion\n\u2217\n\nE-mail: mais@sunhe.jinr.ru\n\n\f2\ncharge). It is a new phase of nuclear matter. The Tc could be reached at energies of SPS,\nRICH and LHC.\nTo explain the above mentioned results we consider the possibility of the phase transition at T < Tc in the system with high barion density (at high \u03bcB ). In such systems\nthe neighbouring nucleons could form the cluster and neighbouring quarks could form the\ndiquarks ( for example in the result of percolation). So these systems are a mixed system\n(MS) of compressed nucleons (clusters) and diquarks which could appear at energies of\nGSI, Synchrophasotron (Nuclatron) and AGS.\nExperimental information on the conditions of the MS appearance could give the possibilities to fix the onset of the deconfinement. It is important for further separate on\nof the effects connected with deconfinement of strong interaction matter from the other\nones.\nThe regime changes which were shown above could be a better indication of the MS\nappearance in high energy interactions, but they are not enough to assert it. For further\nconfirmation of the appearance and existence of the MS it is necessary to obtain an\nadditional experimental information because the regime changes under consideration can\nbe explained by some other approaches without the MS.\nLet us discuss experimental possibilities to get a signal on the MS. First of all we\nhave to answer a question, by what experimental observable effects the MS could be\naccompanied. It is clear that the first effect is a cluster formation ( for example in the\nresult of percolation), the second effect could be the appearance of meson condensation\n(which could be formed in the result of hadronisation of diquarks).\nThere are many papers in which the processes of nuclear fragmentation [7] and the\nprocesses of central collisions [8] are considered as critical phenomena and percolation\napproach is suggested to be used to explain these phenomena. We have used some ideas\nfrom these works to experimental search of a signal on a cluster formation. We suppose\nthat in hadron-nucleus and nucleus-nucleus collisions the cluster could appear on some\ncritical values of Q and would decay into fragments and free nucleons. The number of\nclusters and fragments would increase with Q in the interval less than the critical values\nof Q (for MS formation) and then their values would decrease with the increase of Q\nto the boundary of the central collisions region. It could lead to the regime change in\nthe behavior of different characteristics of events depending on Q and the number of\nfragments. We believed that if the cluster exists and if it is a source of fragments then the\ninfluences of nuclear fragments on the behaviour of the events' characteristics depending\non Q could have a critical character.\n1.1. EXPERIMENT\nTo test this idea the behaviors of the events' number depending on Q have been studied\nby us [9]. The values of Q were determined in two variants. In the first variant the values\nof Q were determined as a number of protons emitted in a event and in the second variant\n\u2013 as a number of protons and fragments emitted in the events. We have used 20407 12 CC\nevents at the momentum of 4.2 A GeV/c [10]. The experimental data were compared with\nthe simulation data coming from the quark-gluon string model (QGSM) without nuclear\nfragments [11]. We want to note that the behavior of the events' number depending on Q\ndetermined for both variants have to be similar if there are no cluster and they would differ\n\n\f3\nif the cluster exists as a source of fragments. The distributions of the events' number as a\nfunction of Q are shown in fig. 1a,b . The open symbols correspond to the first variant of\nQ-determination, the black symbols correspond to the second ones( the fragments were\nincluded). It is seen that for the cases when the fragments numbers were included to\ndetermine Q the form of the distributions sharply changes and has two steps structure\n(black symbols in fig. 1a). The Q-dependencies of the events' number coming from the\nQGSM are shown in fig. 1b . The open symbols correspond to the cases without stripping\nprotons and the black symbols correspond to the cases with the stripping protons. It is\nseen that the form of the distribution strongly differs from the experimental one in fig.\n1a. There is no two steps structure in this figure. Therefore we could assure that the\nobserved difference is connected with the fragment influence. This result demonstrates\nthat the influence of nuclear fragmentation processes in the behavior of the events' number\ndepending on Q has a critical character. To explain this result we can suppose that it\ncould be connected with the existence of a cluster. It is possible that with the increase\nof Q the probability of cluster formation grows but further increasing of the Q ( in the\nregion of high Q) leads to a cluster decay on nuclear fragments and then on free nucleons.\nIt could be the reason of the observed two step structure in the distributions. The first\nstep connected with the formation of a cluster and the second one with its decay. The\nobtained results on multifragment production at high energy nucleus-nucleus interaction\ncould give additional confirmations for it (for example see [12]).\n\nFigure 1.
