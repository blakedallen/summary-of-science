K\\G/P\nis in order preserving bijection with the P -maximal elements of K\\G/B in the same way\nthat P \\G/B is in order preserving bijection with the P -maximal elements of B\\G/B.\n\n1. Introduction\nBruhat order is an important tool in many branches of representation theory, in part\nbecause of the importance of studying orbits on the flag variety. Category O and the category\nof Harish-Chandra modules (see [Kna02] p. 375) are two categories for which representations\nare related to orbits on the flag variety. Let G be a complex reductive linear algebraic\ngroup with Lie algebra g, \u03b8 a Cartan involution of G (specifying a real form), K = G\u03b8 ,\nB a \u03b8-stable Borel subgroup, and P a standard parabolic subgroup containing B. Using\nBeilinson-Bernstein's geometric construction, irreducible representations in Category O of\ntrivial infinitesimal character are known to be in correspondence with B-orbits on the flag\nvariety while irreducible Harish-Chandra modules of trivial infinitesimal character are in\nbijection with K-equivariant local systems on K-orbits on the flag variety. The module\nconstructions may be modified suitably to produce modules for other infinitesimal characters.\nMultiplicities of irreducible composition factors in standard modules for each of these\ncategories can be computed using Kazhdan-Lusztig-Vogan polynomials. Finding efficient\nmeans of computing such polynomials is a heavily studied problem. Since the recursion\nformulas for computing Kazhdan-Lusztig-Vogan polynomials are expressed in terms of the\nBruhat order on orbits and on local systems, we hope that the simplifications to Bruhat order\n1991 Mathematics Subject Classification.

Bruhat order\nis ubiquitous in mathematics and is of fundamental importance.\nWe begin this paper by showing that Bruhat order can be described using only simple\nrelations by:\n(1) a simple geometric argument for spherical subgroups, which includes all of the cases\nconsidered, showing that Bruhat order satisfies property Z (see [Deo77] Theorem 1.1\nand [RS90] Property 5.12(d) or definition 3.10)\n(2) using property Z to show that Bruhat order has the subexpression property.\nSimple relations for Bruhat order are examined from the following perspectives for each\nof B\\G/B, P \\G/B, and K\\G/B:\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\ntopological (closure order)\ncross actions and Cayley transforms\nroots and the Weyl group\nroots and pullbacks.\n\nStrong analogies are drawn between the different cases B\\G/B, P \\G/B, and K\\G/B. This\npermits definitions of standard objects and proofs of properties to be simplified for P \\G/B\nand for K\\G/B: it is more efficient to exploit similarities with B\\G/B than it is to introduce\nnew machinery to accommodate the differences. The simplest combinatorial descriptions of\nthe simple Bruhat relations are Theorems 4.6, 5.8, and 8.23.\nThis paper is structured as follows. Section 2 contains notation and the setup which will\nremain fixed for the duration of the paper. In section 3 we show that Bruhat order for\nspherical subgroups can be described using only simple relations. Sections 4 and 5 discuss\nBruhat order for B\\G/B and for P \\G/B, respectively.\nWe discuss reduced expressions and the exchange property in sections 6 and 7 for each of\nB\\G/B and P \\G/B.\nIn section 8, Bruhat order for K\\G/B is simplified and shown to be analogous to Bruhat\norders for B\\G/B and for P \\G/B.\nIn section 9, we give a simple combinatorial parametrization of K\\G/P (Theorem 9.14).\nIn the same way that P \\G/B is in bijection with maximal length coset representatives,\nK\\G/P is in bijection with \"P -maximal\" elements of K\\G/B. We show that if KuB and\nKvB are \"P -maximal\", then KuP \u0016 KvP \u21d0\u21d2 KuB \u0016 KvB. We discuss how the\nmonoidal action descends (or fails to descend) from K\\G/B to K\\G/P .\nThe final section contains a discussion of future work.\n1.1. Acknowledgements.

Spherical Subgroups: Reducing Bruhat Order to its Simple Relations\nIn this section, we prove that Bruhat order on B\\G/B, P \\G/B, and K\\G/B may be\ndescribed using only simple relations; more generally, if H is a spherical subgroup of G, then\nBruhat order on H\\G/B can be described using only simple relations. For readers far more\naccustomed to Bruhat order on the Weyl group than Bruhat order on K\\G/B, it might be\neasier to read this section last.\nOften, one first encounters Bruhat order as a partial order on the Weyl group and on\nquotients of the Weyl group. That definition of Bruhat order does not immediately lend itself\nto generalization. Since our goal is to unify Bruhat order for B\\G/B, P \\G/B, K\\G/B,\n3\n\n\fand for K\\G/P , before we obtain combinatorially analogous definitions of Bruhat order,\nwe focus on orbits on the flag variety G/B and use the equivalent topological definition of\nBruhat order which is common to all of our settings. Our subgroups B, P , and K share the\ncommon property that they are all spherical subgroups of G.\nDefinition 3.1. A closed subgroup H of G is spherical if it has an open orbit in G/B.\nIt is well-known that if H is spherical, then H\\G/B is finite. This will also follow from\nthe subexpression property.\nDefinition 3.2. Let H be a spherical subgroup of G. Then the closure order on H\\G/B is\ndefined by:\nO1 \u0016H O2 if O1 \u2282 O2 .\nBruhat order on H\\G/B is defined to be closure order.\nIt is well-known that under the bijections B\\G/B \u2194 WG and P \\G/B \u2194 WL \\WG , the\ntopological definition of Bruhat order agrees with the usual definition.\nWe will see that this topological definition can easily be used to find a common proof for\nall of our cases that Bruhat order satisfies property Z and hence satisfies the subexpression\nproperty. Thus, Bruhat order for B\\G/B, P \\G/B, and for K\\G/B may be described using\nonly what we will call simple relations.\nNotation 3.3. Given \u03b1 a simple root, we define P\u03b1 = P{\u03b1} (the standard parabolic of type\n\u03b1 containing B). Then we have the canonical projection:\n\u03c0\u03b1 : G/B \u2192 G/P\u03b1 .\nwhich may be viewed as a projection from B to P\u03b1 , the variety of parabolics of type \u03b1.\nThe set of Borel subgroups contained in P\u03b1 is in bijection with P1 . Therefore we see that:\nLemma 3.4. ([Vog83]) \u03c0\u03b1 is a P1 -fibration: \u03c0 \u22121 \u03c0\u03b1 (x) \u223c\n= P1 for all x \u2208 B.\n\u03b1\n\nP\n\n1\n\n\u2192\n\nG/B\n\u2193 \u03c0\u03b1\nG/P\u03b1 .\n\nBecause of the P1 -fibration,\nCorollary 3.5. Let H be a subgroup of G and let O be an H-orbit on G/B. Then\ndim \u03c0\u03b1\u22121 \u03c0\u03b1 (O) = dim O or dim O + 1.\nLemma 3.6. [Kno95] For spherical subgroups H of G and O an H-orbit on G/B, there is\na unique dense orbit O\u2032 \u2282 \u03c0\u03b1\u22121 \u03c0\u03b1 (O). \u03c0\u03b1\u22121 \u03c0\u03b1 (O) is a union of 1, 2, or 3 orbits.\nProof. This is a consequence of the geometry of each P1 -fibre. Here, we outline Knop's work\nfor its relevance to finiteness of H\\G/B.\nGiven a B-variety, the complexity of the variety is defined to be the minimal codimension\nof a B-orbit in the variety ([Kno95], p. 287). Thus, since H is spherical, the complexity of\nG/H is 0. By Theorem 2.2 of [Kno95], any B-stable subvariety of G/H also has complexity\n0. Therefore \u03c0\u03b1\u22121 \u03c0\u03b1 (O) has a codimension 0 H-orbit, O\u2032 .\nLet x \u2208 G be such that Bx \u2208 O\u2032 . Using the notation of this paper, there is a correspondence ([Kno95] p. 290) between H \u2229 (P\u03b1 )x -orbits on (P\u03b1 )x /Bx \u223c\n= P1 and the H-orbits in\n4\n\n\f\u03c0\u03b1\u22121 \u03c0\u03b1 (O\u2032 ) = \u03c0\u03b1\u22121 \u03c0\u03b1 (O) = H\\xP\u03b1 /B via H \u2229 (P\u03b1 )x xpx\u22121 xB 7\u2192 HxpB for p \u2208 P\u03b1 . This map\nis well-defined and surjective. To show injectivity, suppose that Hxp1 B = Hxp2 B for some\npi \u2208 P\u03b1 . Then we may assume that xp1 = hxp2 b for some h \u2208 H and b \u2208 B. Rearranging,\nwe see that h \u2208 H \u2229 (P\u03b1 )x , whence H \u2229 (P\u03b1 )x xp1 B = H \u2229 (P\u03b1 )x xp2 B.\nFocusing on the action of H \u2229 (P\u03b1 )x on (P\u03b1 )x /Bx \u223c\n= P1 , we may instead study the action\nof H\u0304 which denotes the quotient of H \u2229 (P\u03b1 )x by the kernel of the action on P1 . Then H\u0304\nmay be viewed as a subgroup of Aut(P1 ) \u223c\n= P SL2 (C). According to [Kno95] Lemma 3.1,\nsince the complexity of G/H is 0, therefore H\u0304 has positive dimension. It is easy to classify\nthe orbits of positive dimension subgroups of P SL2 (C) on P1 , and thus \u03c0\u03b1\u22121 \u03c0\u03b1 (O) is a union\nof 1, 2, or 3 orbits with O\u2032 the unique dense orbit (see [Kno95] p. 291).\n\u0003\nDefinition 3.7. If in the previous corollary dim O\u2032 = dim O + 1, then write\n\u03b1\n\n\u2032\nO 7\u2192 O\u2032 or O \u0016H\n\u03b1 O.\n\nThis is a simple relation for Bruhat order.\nRemark 3.8.\n(1) For B\\G/B, we will see that for some w \u2208 WG , O = BwB and O\u2032 =\nBws\u03b1 B with l(ws\u03b1 ) = l(w) + 1.\n\u03b1\n(2) Since O is an arbitrary orbit in \u03c0\u03b1\u22121 \u03c0\u03b1 (O\u2032 ) different from O\u2032 , therefore O 7\u2192 O\u2032 for\nany orbit O different from O\u2032 in \u03c0\u03b1\u22121 \u03c0\u03b1 (O\u2032 ).\nLemma 3.9. Let P1 \u2264 P2 \u2264 G be parabolic subgroups. Since parabolic subgroups are closed,\neach G/Pi is equipped with the quotient topology. Then, letting pi : G \u2192 G/Pi and \u03c0 :\nG/P1 \u2192 G/P2 be the natural projections, we have the commutative diagram:\n\nG\np1\n\u2228\nG/P1 .\n\np2\n> G/P2\n>\n\u03c0\n\nThen given Xi \u2282 G/Pi :\n(1) \u03c0(X1 ) = \u03c0(X1 )\n(2) \u03c0 \u22121 (X2 ) = \u03c0 \u22121 (X2 )\n(3) \u03c0 \u22121 \u03c0(X1 ) = \u03c0 \u22121 \u03c0(X1 ).\nProof. Each G/Pi is a projective variety, and hence complete. Then each \u03c0(X1 ) must be\nclosed (see [Spr09], 6.1.2), whence \u03c0(X1 ) \u2283 \u03c0(X1 ). (Note that this containment could also\nfollow from Lemma 2, p. 68, of [Ste74], just as Lemma 4.5 of [RS90] did.)\n5\n\n\fFor the opposite containment, since the topology on G/Pi is the quotient topology, for\nX1 \u2282 G/P1 :\n\u03c0(X1 ) = p2 (p\u22121\n1 (X1 ))\n\\\n\u2283\np2 (V )\nV\n\n=\nV\n\n\u2283\n\n\u2283p\u22121\n1 (X1 )\n\n\\\n\n\u2283p\u22121\n1 (X1 )\n\n\\\n\nby definition of quotient topology\n\nclosed\n\n\u03c0 \u25e6 p1 (V )\nclosed\n\n\u03c0(X)\n\nX\u2283X1 closed\n\n= \u03c0(X1 ).\nGiven X2 \u2282 G/H2 , repeating the above formulas with p1 in place of p2 , p2 in place of p1 ,\nand \u03c0 \u22121 in place of \u03c0 yields \u03c0 \u22121 (X2 ) \u2283 \u03c0 \u22121 (X2 ). We have the opposite containment since \u03c0\nis continuous.\nThe final statement follows from the first two statements.\n\u0003\nDefinition 3.10. ([Deo77], [RS90]) Let H be a spherical subgroup of G and consider Bruhat\n\u03b1\norder on H\\G/B. Let \u03b1 be a simple root and let u1 , u2 , v1 , v2 \u2208 H\\G/B with u1 7\u2192 u2\n\u03b1\nand v1 7\u2192 v2 . We say that Bruhat order satisfies property Z(\u03b1, u1, v1 ) if the following are\nequivalent:\n\u03b1\n(1) u1 \u0016H v1 or there exists x such that x 7\u2192 u2 and x \u0016H v1\n(2) u2 \u0016H v2\n(3) u1 \u0016H v2 .\nBruhat order is said to satisfy property Z if it satisfies every property Z(\u03b1, u1, v1 ).\nTheorem 3.11. If H is a spherical subgroup of G, then Bruhat order on H\\G/B satisfies\nproperty Z.\nProof. We use the notation of the previous definition, replacing u1 with Ou1 , for example,\nto remind us that we are studying H-orbits.\n\u03b1\n(1) \u21d2 (2): Let x \u0016H v1 be such that x 7\u2192 u2 , possibly setting x = u1 . Applying Lemma 3.9\nwith H1 = B, H2 = P\u03b1 ,\n\u03c0\u03b1\u22121 \u03c0\u03b1 (Ox ) \u2282 \u03c0\u03b1\u22121 \u03c0\u03b1 (Ov1 ) = \u03c0\u03b1\u22121 \u03c0\u03b1 (Ov1 )\n\u222a\nk\nOv2\nOu2\nsince Ov2 is dense in \u03c0\u03b1\u22121 \u03c0\u03b1 (Ov1 ).\n(2) \u21d2 (3): It suffices to note that Ou1 \u2282 \u03c0\u03b1\u22121 \u03c0\u03b1 (Ou1 ) = Ou2 since Ou2 is dense in \u03c0\u03b1\u22121 \u03c0\u03b1 (Ou1 ).\n(3) \u21d2 (1): If Ou1 \u2282 Ov2 = \u03c0\u03b1\u22121 \u03c0\u03b1 (Ov1 ) = \u03c0\u03b1\u22121 \u03c0\u03b1 (Ov1 ), then Ou1 \u2282 \u03c0\u03b1\u22121 \u03c0\u03b1 (\u222au\u0016H v1 Ou ).\nTherefore Ou1 \u2282 \u03c0\u03b1\u22121 \u03c0\u03b1 (Ox ) for some x \u0016H v1 . If x = u1 or x = u2 , then u1 \u0016H v1 .\n\u03b1\nOtherwise, since Ou2 is the unique dense orbit in \u03c0\u03b1\u22121 \u03c0\u03b1 (Ox ), x satisfies x 7\u2192 u2 in addition\nto x \u0016H v1 , whence (1) is satisfied.\n\u0003\nDefinition 3.12. ([RS90], 5.7) Let H be a spherical subgroup of G. A pair of sequences\n((v0 , v1 , . . . , vk ), (\u03b11 , . . . , \u03b1k )), where the vi are H-orbits and the \u03b1i are simple roots, is a\n6\n\n\f\u03b1\n\nreduced decomposition of v \u2208 H\\G/B if v0 is a closed orbit, vk = v, and vi\u22121 7\u2192i vi for\ni = 1, . . . , k. The length of the reduced decomposition is k. Note that dim Ov = dim Ov0 + k.\nDefinition 3.13. Given ((v0 , . . . , vk ), (\u03b11 , . . . , \u03b1k )) a reduced decomposition of v \u2208 H\\G/B,\na subexpression of that reduced decomposition is a sequence (u0 , . . . , uk ) such that u0 = v0\nand for i = 1, . . . , k:\n(1) ui = ui\u22121 , or\n\u03b1\n\u03b1\n(2) \u2203 u such that both ui\u22121 7\u2192i u and ui 7\u2192i u, or\n\u03b1\n(3) ui\u22121 7\u2192i ui .\nRemark 3.14. We see by the deletion condition that this generalizes the usual definition for\nsubexpression for elements of the Weyl group.\nTheorem 3.15. Let H be a spherical subgroup of G. Then Bruhat order for H\\G/B has\nthe subexpression property. That is, u \u0016H v if and only if there is a reduced expression\n((v0 , . . . , vk ), (\u03b11 , . . . , \u03b1k )) of v and a subexpression (u0 , . . . , uk ) of the reduced expression\nsuch that uk = u.\nProof. Deodhar's proof that property Z implies the subexpression property from [Deo77]\nworks in this general setting.\n\u21d0: We prove by induction on j that for each 0 \u2264 j \u2264 k, uj \u0016H vj . The statement holds\nfor j = 0. Assume that the statement holds for j = i \u2212 1. In case (1) where ui = ui\u22121 , the\n\u03b1\nstatement clearly holds for j = i. In case (3), property Z implies that since ui\u22121 7\u2192i ui and\n\u03b1\n\u03b1\n\u03b1\nvi\u22121 7\u2192i vi , then ui\u22121 \u0016H vi\u22121 \u21d2 ui \u0016H vi . In case (2), since ui\u22121 7\u2192i u and vi\u22121 7\u2192i vi , thus\nui\u22121 \u0016H vi\u22121 \u21d2 u \u0016H vi . Then by definition of ui , ui \u0016H u \u0016H vi .\n\u21d2: We prove the converse by induction on the length k of the reduced expression. If k = 0,\nv = v0 and the only subexpressions are those which terminate in u0 = v0 . Assume that the\nconverse holds when the reduced expressions have lengths less than k. (Note that due to\nthe relationship between reduced expression length and dimensions, u \u0016H v implies that the\n\u03b1\nlength of a reduced expression for u is less than or equal to the length for v.) Now, vk\u22121 7\u2192k v.\nIf u \u0016H vk\u22121 , then by induction, there is a subexpression for u of a reduced expression for\nvk\u22121 , whence there is a subexpression for u of a reduced expression for v. Otherwise, there is\n\u03b1\nu\u2032 such that u\u2032 7\u2192k u and, by property Z, u\u2032 \u0016H vk\u22121 . By induction, there is a subexpression\nfor u\u2032 of a reduced expression for vk\u22121 . By appending u and v = vk , we see that there is a\nsubexpression for u of a reduced expression for v.\n\u0003\nCorollary 3.16. If H is a spherical subgroup of G, then H\\G/B is finite.\nProof. This was pointed out by Vogan. Since the dimension of an H-orbit is finite, therefore\nthere are finitely many reduced expressions for the unique open orbit in G/B. There are\nfinitely many subexpressions of each reduced expression, and thus by the subexpression\nproperty, H\\G/B is finite.\n\u0003\nCorollary 3.17. Bruhat order for B\\G/B, P \\G/B, and K\\G/B satisfy the subexpression\nproperty, whence Bruhat order can be defined using only simple relations.\nIt is the focus of the subsequent chapters to find elementary means of describing these\nsimple relations and showing how their descriptions are analogous in all of our settings.\n7\n\n\f4. Bruhat Order for B\\G/B\n4.1. Equivalence of Closure Order and Bruhat Order on W . As mentioned, it is\nwell-known that B\\G/B is in bijection with the Weyl group:\nProposition 4.1. Bruhat Decomposition:\nG = \u2210w\u2208W B \u1e87B = \u2210w\u2208W BwB.\nTherefore B\\G/B \u2194 W .\nWe review the definition of Bruhat order on the Weyl group WG arising from viewing it\nas a reflection group.\nt\n\nDefinition 4.2. For u, v \u2208 W , t a (not necessarily simple) reflection, we write u \u2212\n\u2192 v if\nv = ut and l(u) < l(v). Bruhat order on W is defined by u \u2264 v if there exists a sequence of\nelements w0 , w1 , . . . , wk \u2208 W such that u = w0 \u2192 w1 \u2192 * * * \u2192 wk = v.\nTheorem 4.3. Let Ow = BwB for w \u2208 W and let \u03b1 be a simple root. Then\ns\n\n\u03b1\n\n\u03b1\nOw 7\u2192 O if and only if O = Ows\u03b1 and w \u2212\u2192\nws\u03b1 .\n\nProof. This is well-known, but we provide a discussion to illuminate the source of the\nsimilarities between the various double cosets for which we consider Bruhat order. First,\n\u03c0\u03b1\u22121 \u03c0\u03b1 (BwB) = BwP\u03b1 /B = BwB \u222a Bws\u03b1 B by the parabolic Bruhat decomposition (Proposition 5.1) and by Lemma 8.3.7 of [Spr09].\nRecall that l(w) = #{\u03b1 \u2208 \u2206+ : w\u03b1 < 0}. Under the correspondence G/B \u2194 B where\ngB 7\u2192 gBg \u22121 = Bg , we may view B\u1e87 as a point in the orbit Ow and B \u2229 B\u1e87 as the stabilizer\nof that point. If l(ws\u03b1 ) = l(w)+1, then dim B \u2229B\u1e87 = dim B \u2229B\u1e87\u1e61\u03b1 +1. Since the dimension\nof a B-orbit is the dimension of B minus the dimension of the stabilizer of a point in the\norbit, dim BwB + 1 = dim Bws\u03b1 B.\n\u0003\nRemark 4.4. The relationship between the dimension of an orbit and the dimension of the\nstabilizer of a point in the orbit is the source of the similarities between descriptions of simple\nBruhat relations for our various settings in terms of Weyl group elements and positive roots.\nObserving now that the notion of reduced decomposition arising from viewing W as a\nreflection group corresponds with definition 3.12, we conclude:\nCorollary 4.5. Under the correspondence arising from the Bruhat decomposition (Proposition 4.1), Bruhat order for B\\G/B agrees with Bruhat order for W .\nWe now proceed to reformulate simple relations for Bruhat order. We find that our\nreformulations apply not only to simple relations.\n4.2. Weyl Group and Roots. Another means of describing (not necessarily simple) Bruhat\nrelations is:\nTheorem 4.6. Let \u03b1 be a positive root and w \u2208 W . Then:\ns\n\n\u03b1\nw \u2212\u2192\nws\u03b1 if w\u03b1 \u2208 \u2206+ = \u2206(u, t)\n\ns\n\n\u03b1\nw \u2190\u2212\nws\u03b1 if w\u03b1 \u2208 \u2206\u2212 = \u2206(u\u2212 , t).\n\n8\n\n\fProof. This is known if \u03b1 is a simple root ([Hum90], Lemma 1.6). In general, suppose l(w) <\nl(ws\u03b1 ). Let ws\u03b1 = s1 s2 * * * sr be a reduced expression for ws\u03b1 . By the strong exchange condition, w = s1 s2 * * * \u015di * * * sr . Then s\u03b1 = w \u22121 s1 s2 * * * sr = sr sr\u22121 * * * si+1 si si+1 * * * sr\u22121 sr . We\nconclude that \u03b1 = sr sr\u22121 * * * si+1 \u03b1i . (Note that since s1 s2 * * * sr is a reduced expression, \u03b1 =\nsr sr\u22121 * * * si+1 \u03b1i is a positive root, [Hum90] p. 14.) Then w\u03b1 = s1 * * * \u015di * * * sr sr * * * si+1 \u03b1i =\ns1 * * * si\u22121 \u03b1i > 0 since s1 s2 * * * sr is a reduced expression.\nSimilarly, if l(w) > l(ws\u03b1 ), then w\u03b1 < 0.\n\u0003\n4.3. Roots and Pullbacks. Let \u2206 = \u2206(g, t) and \u2206+ = \u2206(b, t). Recall the notation of\nint(g)\n\nAd(g)\n\nsection 2: B = T U 7\u2212\u2192 Bg = Tg Ug . Considering Lie algebras, b = t \u2295 u 7\u2212\u2192 bg = tg \u2295 ug .\nWe have the map between Cartan subalgebras Ad(g \u22121) : tg \u2192 t, while pullback allows us to\nmap between duals of Cartan subalgebras: Ad(g \u22121 )\u2217 : t\u2217 \u2192 t\u2217g :\n(Ad(g \u22121)\u2217 \u03b1)(t) = \u03b1(Ad(g \u22121 )t) for all t \u2208 tg .\nLetting \u03b1g = Ad(g \u22121 )\u2217 \u03b1, it is easy to see that\nM\nM\ng\u03b1g\ng\u03b1 \u2192 ug =\nAd(g) : u =\n\u03b1\u2208\u2206+\n\n\u03b1\u2208\u2206+\n\nAd(g)g\u03b1 = g\u03b1g .\n\nwith\n\nIt is straightforward to prove (use int rather than Ad):\nLemma 4.7. For w \u2208 W and n \u2208 N(T ) any representative of w, w\u03b1 = \u03b1n . In particular,\nw\u03b1 = \u03b1\u1e87 .\nUsing pullbacks, Bruhat order may be reformulated as follows:\nProposition 4.8. Let \u03b1 be a positive root and w \u2208 W . Then:\ns\n\n\u03b1\nw \u2212\u2192\nws\u03b1 if \u03b1\u1e87 \u2208 \u2206(u, t)\n\ns\n\n\u03b1\nw \u2190\u2212\nws\u03b1 if \u03b1\u1e87 \u2208 \u2206(u\u2212 , t).\n\nThis may also be written\n\u03b1\n\nBwB 7\u2192 Bws\u03b1 B if \u03b1\u1e87 \u2208 \u2206(u, t)\n\u03b1\n\nBwB \u2190[ Bws\u03b1 B if \u03b1\u1e87 \u2208 \u2206(u\u2212 , t).\nRemark 4.9. Pullbacks turn out to be particularly useful in studying Bruhat order in more\ngeneral situations: for example, if one of the subgroups with respect to which you take double\ncosets is twisted by conjugation or if that subgroup is a more general spherical subgroup.\nSee [PSY] for details.\n4.4. Cross Actions.\nDefinition 4.10. The cross action of W on B\\G/B is the action generated by\ns\u03b1 \u00d7 B \u1e87B := B \u1e87\u1e61\u22121\n\u03b1 B\nwhere \u03b1 is a simple root.\nUnder the correspondence between B\\G/B and W , cross action corresponds to the natural\nleft action of W on itself by right multiplication by the inverse.\nIt follows immediately:\n9\n\n\fTheorem 4.11. Let \u03b1 be a positive root and w \u2208 W . Then:\n\u03b1\n\nBwB 7\u2192 s\u03b1 \u00d7 BwB = Bws\u22121\n\u03b1 B = Bws\u03b1 B if w\u03b1 \u2208 \u2206(u, t)\n\u03b1\n\n\u2212\nBwB \u2190[ s\u03b1 \u00d7 BwB = Bws\u22121\n\u03b1 B = Bws\u03b1 B if w\u03b1 \u2208 \u2206(u , t).\n\n5. Bruhat Order on P \\G/B\n5.1. Equivalence of Closure Order with Bruhat Order for WL \\WG . It is well-known\nthat:\nProposition 5.1. ([DM91] Proposition 1.6, [Hum75] Lemma 8.3.7) Bruhat Decomposition:\nP = \u2210w\u2208WL B \u1e87B = \u2210w\u2208WL BwB\nand thus P \\G/B \u2194 WL \\WG . Furthermore,\nP wB = \u2210x\u2208WL BxwB.\nThe commonly used definition for Bruhat order on WL \\WG viewed as a reflection group\nquotient is this:\nDefinition 5.2. Bruhat order on WL \\WG is the partial order induced from Bruhat order\non WG . That is, WL u \u2264 WL v if there are coset representatives u0 and v0 , respectively, such\nthat u0 \u2264 v0 .\nThat is, if u, v \u2208 WG are such that u \u2264 v, then WL u \u2264 WL v. The converse holds for\nminimal length coset representatives:\nProposition 5.3. Let u, v \u2208 WG be minimal length coset representatives for WL u and for\nWL v. Then\nWL u \u2264 WL v \u21d0\u21d2 u \u2264 v.\nProof. This is a special case of [Deo77], Lemma 3.5. For a purely topological proof using\nmaximal length coset representatives, adapt the proof of Proposition 9.16.\n\u0003\nBecause closure order for B\\G/B corresponds to Bruhat order for WG , by the Bruhat\ndecomposition applied to P wB, closure order for P \\G/B corresponds to Bruhat order for\nWL \\WG :\nTheorem 5.4.

For\nu, v \u2208 WG minimal length coset representatives of WL u and WL v:\nOu \u0016P Ov \u21d0\u21d2 WL u \u2264 WL v.\nLet w \u2208 WG and let \u03b1 \u2208 \u2206+ (g, t). Using the nomenclature of Casian-Collingwood from\n[CC87] for cases which may be shown to correspond,\nP wB = P ws\u03b1B if w\u03b1 \u2208 \u2206(l, t)\nP wB \u0016P\u03b1 P ws\u03b1B if w\u03b1 \u2208 \u2206(n, t)\nP wB \u0017P\u03b1 P ws\u03b1B if w\u03b1 \u2208 \u2206(n\u2212 , t)\n10\n\ni.e. \u03b1 is Levi type\ni.e. \u03b1 is complex upward\ni.e. \u03b1 is complex downward.\n\n\fProof. First, u \u2264 v implies that B u\u0307B \u0016B B v\u0307B which implies that P u\u0307B \u0016P P v\u0307B.

The rest of the theorem now follows.\n\u0003\nRemark 5.5. This proof does not generalize to K\\G/P since it relies upon the Bruhat\ndecomposition. We could also have proved the theorem using the following more general\nheuristic. Bruhat order and closure order on P \\G/B are the same since:\n(1) Bruhat order is induced by Bruhat order on B\\G/B and closure order and Bruhat\norder for B\\G/B are the same;\n(2) the topology on G/B is the quotient topology.\nThe proof is concise, but rather than record it, we refer the reader to the proof of Theorem\n9.1 where the order induced from Bruhat order on K\\G/B and closure order of K\\G/P are\nshown to be the same. The proofs are similar.\nRecall that Bruhat order for P \\G/B satisfies property Z. We may restate property Z for\nWL \\WG :\nDefinition 5.6. Let u, v \u2208 WG be minimal length coset representatives for WL u and for\nWL v. Let s be a simple reflection. Then property Z(s, WL u, WL v) is satisfied if whenever\nl(us) \u2264 l(u) and l(vs) \u2264 l(v), then\nWL u \u2264 WL v \u21d0\u21d2 WL us \u2264 WL v \u21d0\u21d2 WL us \u2264 WL vs.\nFurthermore, an analogue of Deodhar's description II for Bruhat order on WG from [Deo77]\nholds:\nProposition 5.7. Bruhat order is the unique partial order on WL \\WG such that\n(1) for all WL w \u2208 WL \\WG , WL w \u2264 WL 1 \u21d0\u21d2 WL w = WL 1;\n(2) \u2264 has property Z(s, WL u, WL v).\nAgain, Bruhat order for P \\G/B may be described using only simple relations and we\nfocus on reformulations of those relations. As for B\\G/B, our reformulations apply not just\nto the simple relations.\n5.2. Weyl Group and Roots. Here we describe (not necessarily simple) Bruhat relations\nusing the Weyl group and roots.\nTheorem 5.8. Let w \u2208 WG and let \u03b1 \u2208 \u2206+ . Then\nWL w\n\nWL ws\u03b1\n\nif w\u03b1 \u2208 \u2206(l, t)\n\ns\u03b1\n\n=\n\nWL w \u2212\u2192 WL ws\u03b1\n\nif w\u03b1 \u2208 \u2206(n, t)\n\ns\u03b1\n\nif w\u03b1 \u2208 \u2206(n\u2212 , t)\n\nWL w \u2190\u2212 WL ws\u03b1\n11\n\n\fNote that this is analogous to Bruhat order relations for B\\G/B with l analogous to t,\n\u2206(t, t) = {}.\nRemark 5.9. Compare this characterization to John Stembridge's characterization of parabolic Bruhat order in section 2 of [Ste02] in which WL -cosets are associated with WG -orbits in\nthe dual space of the Cartan subalgebra with stabilizer WL . Bruhat order then corresponds\nto the partial order on the root lattice.\n5.3. Roots and Pullbacks. Since \u03b1\u1e87 = w\u03b1, we may reformulate Bruhat order as follows:\nTheorem 5.10. Let \u03b1 be a positive root and w \u2208 WG . Then\n\u03b1\n\nP wB 7\u2192 P ws\u03b1B if \u03b1\u1e87 \u2208 \u2206(n, t)\n\u03b1\n\nP wB \u2190[ P ws\u03b1B if \u03b1\u1e87 \u2208 \u2206(n\u2212 , t).\n5.4. Cross Actions.\nDefinition 5.11. The cross action of W on P \\G/B is the action generated by\ns\u03b1 \u00d7 P wB := P ws\u22121\n\u03b1 B\nwhere \u03b1 is a positive root.\nIt follows immediately:\nTheorem 5.12. Let \u03b1 be a positive root and w \u2208 W . Then the cross action corresponding\nto \u03b1 satisfies:\nP wB = s\u03b1 \u00d7 P wB = P ws\u22121\n\u03b1 B if w\u03b1 \u2208 \u2206(l, t)\n\u03b1\n\nP wB 7\u2192 s\u03b1 \u00d7 P wB = P ws\u22121\n\u03b1 B if w\u03b1 \u2208 \u2206(n, t)\n\u03b1\n\n\u2212\nP wB \u2190[ s\u03b1 \u00d7 BwB = P ws\u22121\n\u03b1 B if w\u03b1 \u2208 \u2206(n , t).\n\nProof. Again, if w\u03b1 \u2208 \u2206(l, t), then \u1e61w\u03b1 \u2208 L \u2282 P . The remainder of the proof resembles\nprevious arguments.\n\u0003\n6. Reduced Expressions for B\\G/B and P \\G/B\nThroughout this section, wherever w = si1 si2 * * * sik , let wj = si1 si2 * * * sij for 1 \u2264 j \u2264 k.\n6.1. B\\G/B. An important aspect of Bruhat order is understanding decompositions of Weyl\ngroup elements into products of simple reflections.\nDefinition 6.1. Let w \u2208 WG . Then the product of simple reflections w = si1 si2 * * * sik is a\nreduced expression for w (or B-reduced expression) if k is minimal.\nThe following result is standard:\nProposition 6.2. Let w \u2208 WG where w = si1 si2 * * * sik as a product of simple reflections.\nThen w = si1 si2 * * * sik is a reduced expression if and only if wj \u03b1ij+1 > 0 for j = 1, 2, . . . , k\u22121.\nThis is the equivalent definition for reduced expression that generalizes nicely to P \\G/B.\n12\n\n\f6.2. P \\G/B. Again, we wish to simplify the existing literature and limit the introduction\nof complex machinery as much as possible.\nDefinition 6.3. An element w \u2208 WG is P -minimal if it is a minimal length coset representative for WL w. Equivalently, w\u03b1 \u2208 \u2206(n, t) for every \u03b1 \u2208 I.\nRemark 6.4. As discussed, WL \\WG is in bijection with the P -minimal elements of WG .\nDefinition 6.5. Let w \u2208 WG be P -minimal. A P -reduced expression for w is a product of\nsimple reflections w = si1 si2 * * * sik where wj \u03b1ij+1 \u2208 \u2206(n, t) for j = 1, 2, . . . , k \u2212 1. We define\nlP (w) = k, the P -length of w.\nLemma 6.6. If w \u2208 W is P -minimal, then any B-reduced expression for w is also P -reduced.\nProof. The P -minimal element has a B-reduced expression w = si1 * * * sik . Each wj\u22121 \u03b1j is\npositive. Consider the equations\nWL w = WL s\u03b1\n\nif w\u03b1 \u2208 \u2206(l, t)\n\n\u03b1\n\nif w\u03b1 \u2208 \u2206(n, t)\n\n\u03b1\n\nif w\u03b1 \u2208 \u2206(n\u2212 , t).\n\nWL w \u2212\n\u2192 WL s\u03b1\nWL w \u2190\n\u2212 WL s\u03b1\n\nIf the expression is not P -reduced, then for some 1 \u2264 j \u2264 k, we have wj\u22121 \u03b1j \u2208 \u2206+ (l, t). Then\nw = swj\u22121 \u03b1j wj\u22121 sij+1 * * * sk whence WL w = WL si1 * * * \u015dij * * * sik , contradicting minimality of\nw. Thus our expression must be P -reduced.\n\u0003\nProposition 6.7. Every coset in WL \\WG has a unique P -minimal representative and every\nP -minimal representative has a P -reduced expression.\nProof. The first statement follows immediately from the definition of P -minimal element.\nThe second statement follows from the previous lemma.\n\u0003\nRemark 6.8. We can likewise define P -maximal elements: w \u2208 WG is P -maximal if it is a\nmaximal length coset representative for WL w. Equivalently, w\u03b1 \u2208 \u2206(n\u2212 , t) for every \u03b1 \u2208 I.\nWe also have a bijection between WL \\WG and the P -maximal elements of WG . See the\ndiscussion of P -maximal elements in section 9 where we discuss K\\G/P .\n7. Exchange Property for B\\G/B and P \\G/B\n7.1. B\\G/B. The Exchange Property for WG is the following:\nTheorem 7.1. Let w = si1 si2 . . . sik \u2208 WG be a reduced expression and let \u03b1 \u2208 \u03a0. If w\u03b1 < 0,\nthen l(w) > l(ws\u03b1 ). The Exchange Property is the assertion that there exists some j such\nthat ws\u03b1 = si1 si2 * * * \u015dij * * * sik is a reduced expression for ws\u03b1 and hence si1 si2 * * * \u015dij * * * sik s\u03b1\nis a reduced expression for w.\n7.2. P \\G/B. The Exchange Property for WL \\WG may be described similarly:\nTheorem 7.2. Let w = si1 si2 * * * sik \u2208 WG be a P -reduced expression and let \u03b1 \u2208 \u03a0. If\nw\u03b1 \u2208 \u2206(n\u2212 , t), then there exists some j such that ws\u03b1 = si1 si2 * * * \u015dij * * * sik and it is a P reduced expression for ws\u03b1 . It follows that w = si1 si2 * * * \u015dij * * * sik s\u03b1 is a P -reduced expression\nfor w.\n13\n\n\fProof. We know that there exists j such that si1 si2 * * * \u015dij * * * sik is a B-reduced expression\nfor ws\u03b1. Since w\u03b1 \u2208 \u2206(n\u2212 , t), therefore P wB 6= P ws\u03b1B, dim P ws\u03b1B = dim P ws\u03b1 B \u2212 1,\nand l(ws\u03b1) = k \u2212 1. Since, as we analyze each location in any expression, roots in l fix the\ncorresponding orbit, roots in n increase the orbit dimension, while roots in n\u2212 decrease the\norbit dimension, therefore each simple reflection in our expression must increase dimension,\nwhence ws\u03b1 = si1 si2 * * * \u015dij * * * sik must be a P -reduced expression as well. Since w = si1 * * * sik\n\u0003\nis a P -reduced expression for w, considering length, so must w = si1 * * * \u015dij * * * sik s\u03b1 .\n8. Bruhat Order on K\\G/B\nBruhat order for K\\G/B may differ in \"direction\" in the literature due to a preference to\nassociate the minimal length reduced expression with the open dense orbit since the open\norbit is unique while the closed minimal dimension orbits generally are not.\n8.1. Parametrizing K\\G/B. We use the parametrization of K\\G/B as presented in [Spr85],\nwhich is an excellent reference. Recall that K = G\u03b8 and B = T U is a \u03b8-stable Borel subgroup\nand Levi decomposition.\nNotation 8.1. Modifying Springer's parametrization for B\\G/K, we set:\n\u2022 V := {x \u2208 G|x\u22121 \u03b8(x) \u2208 N(T )}\n\u2022 V := K \u00d7 T -orbits on V : (k, t) * x = kxt\u22121\n\u2022 v\u0307 \u2208 V is a representative of v.\nProposition 8.2. [Spr85] V is in bijection with K\\G/B.\n8.2. Real Forms and Root Types. In order to discuss Bruhat order in detail, we must\ndiscuss real forms and root types. A real form of the complex Lie algebra g is a real Lie\nsubalgebra g0 such that g = g0 \u2295 ig0 . A less obvious way to specify a real form is to select a\nCartan involution \u03b8. (Use the Cartan decomposition g = k \u2295 s and the fact that the Killing\nform is positive definite on ik0 \u2295 s0 .)\nWe begin by studying the Cartan subalgebra.\nLemma 8.3. ([Kna02]) Given any \u03b8-stable Cartan subalgebra t and Cartan decomposition\nt0 = tc0 \u2295 tn0 of its real form, it is known that roots \u03b1 \u2208 \u2206(g, t) are real-valued on itc0 \u2295 tn0 .\nThus \u03b8\u03b1 = \u2212\u1fb1.\nRemark 8.4. Recall that \u1fb1(X) = \u03b1(X\u0304).\nDefinition 8.5. Given t a \u03b8-stable CSA, relative to \u03b8, \u03b1 \u2208 \u2206(g, t) is:\n(1) real if \u03b8\u03b1 = \u2212\u03b1\n(2) imaginary if \u03b8\u03b1 = \u03b1\n(3) complex if \u03b8\u03b1 6= \u00b1\u03b1.\nDefinition 8.6. Given g \u2208 G, recall \u03b1g := Ad\u2217g\u22121 \u03b1 : tg = Adg t \u2192 C. Relative to g, \u03b1 is:\n(1) real if \u1fb1g = \u2212\u03b1g\n(2) imaginary if \u1fb1g = \u03b1g\n(3) complex if \u1fb1g 6= \u00b1\u03b1g .\nNotation 8.7. Let v \u2208 V and let n = v\u0307 \u22121 \u03b8(v\u0307), and w = nT . Since v \u2208 V , it follows that\n\u03b8(w) = w \u22121.\n14\n\n\fWe study the particular case where g = v\u0307 \u2208 V .\nLemma 8.8. ([Spr85]) If v \u2208 V , then v\u0307T v\u0307 \u22121 is a \u03b8-stable Cartan subgroup.\nThis allows us to describe root types using \u03b8.\nDefinition 8.9. If v \u2208 V , then relative to v \u03b1 is:\n(1) real if \u03b8\u03b1v = \u2212\u03b1v\n(2) imaginary if \u03b8\u03b1v = \u03b1v\n(3) complex if \u03b8\u03b1v 6= \u00b1\u03b1v .\nsince Tv\u0307 is \u03b8-stable.\nEquivalently,\nDefinition 8.10. ([Spr85]) Relative to v \u2208 V (or w = v\u0307 \u22121 \u03b8(v\u0307)T \u2208 WG ) \u03b1 is:\n(1) real if w\u03b8\u03b1 = \u2212\u03b1\n(2) imaginary if w\u03b8\u03b1 = \u03b1\n(3) complex if w\u03b8\u03b1 6= \u00b1\u03b1.\nProposition 8.11. The previous two definitions for real, complex, and imaginary are consistent.\nProof. Let T1 = vT v \u22121, which is \u03b8-stable because v \u2208 V . Then \u2212\u1fb1v = \u03b8\u03b1v . Given t1 \u2208 T1 ,\n\u03b8\u03b1v (t1 ) = \u03b1v (\u03b8\u22121 (t1 )) = \u03b1(v \u22121 \u03b8\u22121 (t1 )v)\nwhereas for t = v \u22121 t1 v \u2208 T ,\nw\u03b8\u03b1(t) = \u03b8\u03b1(n\u22121 tn) = \u03b1(\u03b8\u22121 (\u03b8(v)\u22121 v)\u03b8\u22121 (t)\u03b8\u22121 (v \u22121 \u03b8(v)))\n= \u03b1(v \u22121 \u03b8\u22121 (vtv \u22121 )v)\n= \u03b1(v \u22121 \u03b8\u22121 (t1 )v).\nSince \u03b1v (t1 ) = \u03b1(t), we see therefore that\n\u03b8\u03b1v (t1 ) = \u03b1v (t1 )\n\u03b8\u03b1v (t1 ) = \u2212\u03b1v (t1 )\n\u03b8\u03b1v (t1 ) 6= \u00b1\u03b1v (t1 )\n\n\u21d0\u21d2\n\u21d0\u21d2\n\u21d0\u21d2\n\nw\u03b8\u03b1(t) = \u03b1(t)\nw\u03b8\u03b1(t) = \u2212\u03b1(t)\nw\u03b8\u03b1(t) 6= \u00b1\u03b1(t).\n\u0003\n\nIt follows from these computations that:\nCorollary 8.12. For \u03b1 \u2208 \u03a0, v \u2208 V , w = v\u0307 \u22121 \u03b8(v\u0307)T \u2208 W ,\nw\u03b8\u03b1 = (\u03b8\u03b1v )v\u22121 .\nWe may further distinguish imaginary roots as compact or noncompact.\nDefinition 8.13. Let \u03b1 be an imaginary root. Normalizing the one-parameter subgroup x\u03b1\nappropriately,\n\u03b8(x\u03b1 (\u03be)) = x\u03b8\u03b1 (c\u03b1 \u03be) = x\u03b1 (c\u03b1 \u03be) where c\u03b1 = \u00b11.\nThe root \u03b1 is said to be compact imaginary if c\u03b1 = 1 and noncompact imaginary if c\u03b1 = \u22121.\n15\n\n\fDefinition 8.14. Suppose the root \u03b1 is imaginary relative to v \u2208 V . Then, normalizing x\u03b1v\nappropriately,\n\u03b8(x\u03b1v (\u03be)) = x\u03b8\u03b1v (c\u03b1v \u03be) = x\u03b1v (c\u03b1v \u03be) where c\u03b1v = \u00b11.\nWe say that \u03b1 is compact relative to v if c\u03b1v = 1 and noncompact if c\u03b1v = \u22121.\nSpringer showed that if v \u2208 V and n \u2208 N(T ), then vn\u22121 \u2208 V , so there is a left WG -action\non V and also on V [Spr85].\nDefinition 8.15. The cross action on K\\G/B corresponds to Springer's WG -action on V .\nThat is,\ns\u03b1 \u00d7 K v\u0307B = K v\u0307\u1e61\u22121\n\u03b1 B.\nSuppose \u03b1 \u2208 \u03a0 is noncompact imaginary relative to v \u2208 V . In section 6.7 of [Spr85],\nSpringer defines the automorphism \u03c8(g) = v\u0307 \u22121 \u03b8(v\u0307)\u03b8(g)\u03b8(v\u0307)\u22121 v\u0307. We observe that this is\nsimply \u03b8n (g) := int(n) \u25e6 \u03b8(g). Since \u03b8(n) = n\u22121 , this is an involutive automorphism. It is\nnow easy to see, as Springer pointed out, that \u03c8 descends to an involutive automorphism of\nG\u03b1 , the subgroup corresponding to \u00b1\u03b1, since \u03b1 is imaginary relative to \u03b8n . Springer shows\nthat \u03c8(x\u03b1 (m)) = x\u03b1 (\u2212m), \u03c8(x\u2212\u03b1 (m)) = x\u2212\u03b1 (m), and \u03c8(\u1e61\u03b1 ) = \u1e61\u22121\n\u03b1 . Springer claims that\nthere is z\u03b1 \u2208 G\u03b1 such that z\u03b1 \u03c8(z\u03b1 )\u22121 = \u1e61\u03b1 .

The reductive subalgebra k plays an analogous role to l in P \\G/B\nand to t in B\\G/B. Furthermore, in the cases B\\G/B and P \\G/B, \u03b8 = Id.\nProof.

Since B is \u03b8-stable, therefore \u03b8\u2206+ = \u2206+ .\nIf w\u03b8\u03b1 > 0, then \u03b8(w\u03b8\u03b1) > 0. Since \u03b8(w) = w \u22121, therefore \u03b8(w\u03b8\u03b1) = w \u22121\u03b1. From w \u22121 \u03b1 > 0,\nwe conclude that l(s\u03b1 w) = l(w)+1. From \u03b8\u2206+ = \u2206+ , we also conclude that \u03b8\u03a0 = \u03a0, whence\n\u03b8\u03b1 is a simple root. Since \u03b1 is complex relative to v so that w\u03b8\u03b1 6= \u00b1\u03b1, therefore s\u03b1 w\u03b8\u03b1 > 0,\nwhence l(s\u03b1 ws\u03b8\u03b1 ) = l(s\u03b1 w) + 1 = l(w) + 2. Similarly, if w\u03b8\u03b1 < 0, then \u03b8(w\u03b8\u03b1) = w \u22121\u03b1 < 0\nas well and l(s\u03b1 ws\u03b8\u03b1) = l(s\u03b1 w) \u2212 1 = l(w) \u2212 2. The complex case now follows from the case\nanalysis in 4.3 of [RS90].\n\u0003\n8.5. Roots and Pullbacks.\nTheorem 8.24. Let v \u2208 V and \u03b1 \u2208 \u03a0.

We review the discussion of monoids in [RS90] and study\nhow we may specify elements of V by the monoidal action using our combinatorial results.\nDefinition 8.25. ([RS90], 3.10) Given the Coxeter group (W, S), the monoid M(W ) has\ngenerators m(s) (s \u2208 S) and the relations:\n(1) m(s)2 = m(s) s \u2208 S;\n(2) braid relations: if s, t \u2208 S are distinct, then\n(a) o(st) = 2k: (m(s)m(t))k = (m(t)m(s))k\n(b) o(st) = 2k + 1: (m(s)m(t))k m(s) = (m(t)m(s))k m(t).\nProposition 8.26. ([RS90], 3.10)\n(1) If w = s1 s2 . . . sl is a reduced decomposition of w, then m(w) := m(s1 )m(s2 ) * * * m(sl ) \u2208\nM(W ) is independent of the reduced decomposition chosen.\n(2) M(W ) = {m(w)\n\u001a : w \u2208 W }.\nm(ws) if ws > w\n(3) m(w)m(s) =\nm(w)\nif ws < w.\nDefinition 8.27. ([RS90], 4.7) There is an action of the monoid M(W ) on V : if Ov\u2032 is the\nunique dense orbit in KvP\u03b1 , then m(s\u03b1 )v = v \u2032 . Thus:\nIf Ov \u0016K\n\u03b1 Ov\u2032 then\nOtherwise,\n\nm(s\u03b1 )v = v \u2032 .\nm(s\u03b1 )v = v.\n\nThe monoidal action should be thought of in the following way. When considering Weyl\ngroup actions, s \u2208 S is self-inverse, so acting twice by s should return the original element.\nThe action of s can both raise and lower dimensions. In contrast, the monoidal action of\ns \u2208 S on v \u2208 V only changes v if a cross action or Cayley transform corresponding to s\nraises the dimension. Thus repeated monoidal actions of s are the same as acting once. This\nagrees with m(s)2 = m(s). Considering a string of simple monoidal actions, we may always\nremove the simple elements which do not raise dimension. As for the Weyl group action on\nB\\G/B and on P \\G/B, any element of V can be obtained by M(W ) acting on the closed\norbits in V .\n19\n\n\fNotation 8.28.

Begin by letting wj = vj\u22121 \u03b8(vj )T \u2208 WG . Since \u03b1k is noncompact imaginary relative\n\u22121\n\u22121\nto vk\u22121 , therefore wk\u22121 \u03b8\u03b1k = \u03b1k . Therefore (vk\u22121 s\u22121\n\u03b1k ) \u03b8(vk\u22121 s\u03b1k )T = s\u03b1k wk\u22121 \u03b8(s\u03b1k ) =\n2\ns\u03b1k swk\u22121 \u03b8\u03b1k wk\u22121 = s\u03b1k wk\u22121 = wk\u22121 . Recall Definition 8.10. Thus if \u03b2 is real, imaginary,\nor complex relative to v and \u03b1 is non-compact relative to v, then \u03b2 is real, imaginary, or\ncomplex, respectively, relative to s\u03b1 \u00d7 v. Our tables before Theorem 8.22 show that if \u03b2 is\ntype I relative to v, then it is type I relative to s\u03b1 \u00d7 v. If \u03b2 is compact relative to v (that is,\nd(\u03b8int(v))X\u03b2 = d int(v)X\u03b2 for X\u03b2 \u2208 g\u03b2 ) and \u03b1 is non-compact type I or type II relative to\nv, then we see that \u03b2 is compact relative to s\u03b1 \u00d7 v:\nd(\u03b8int(v \u1e61\u22121\n\u03b1 ))X\u03b2 =\n=\n=\n=\n=\n\n\u22121\nd(\u03b8(int(v \u1e61\u22121\n\u03b1 v )int(v))X\u03b2\nd(int(\u03b8(\u1e61\u03b1v )\u03b8int(v))X\u03b2\nd(int(\u1e61\u03b1v )int(v))X\u03b2\nd(int(v \u1e61\u03b1 ))X\u03b2\nd(int(v \u1e61\u22121\n\u03b1 ))X\u03b2 .\n\n20\n\n\fWe see that whatever type some simple root \u03b2 is relative to vk\u22121 , it is precisely the same type\nrelative to s\u03b1k \u00d7 vk\u22121 . Recall that c\u03b1k (s\u03b1k \u00d7 vk\u22121 ) = vk as well. Since only noncompact type\nI roots cause ambiguity in taking inverses of cross actions and Cayley transforms, therefore\nby induction, the proposition holds.\n\u0003\nThus using our simple combinatorial descriptions of simple relations in Bruhat order, it is\neasy to understand:\nRemark 8.33. There are two general methods of specifying any element u \u2208 V up to braid\nrelations:\n(1) There is u0 \u2208 V0 and a sequence\ns\n\nu\n\ns\n\n1\n2\nk\nu0 \u2212\n\u2192\nu1 \u2212\nuk = u.\n\u2192\nu2 * * * \u2212\u2192\n\nThis specifies u unambiguously.\n(2) Let the unique open dense orbit in K\\G/B be KvB.

To uniquely identify u, specify a choice for each type I inverse Cayley\ntransform.\nCorollary 8.34.

As we will see, the key to parametrizing K\\G/P is understanding the Bruhat\norder of K\\G/B restricted to the B-orbits in a P -orbit.\nSince P \u2283 B, therefore each P -orbit KvP can be expressed as a union of B-orbits KuB.\nThis is an example of an I-equivalence class, defined in the preprint [PSY] on generalized\nHarish-Chandra modules:\n21\n\n\fDefinition 9.2. Recall the map \u03c0I : G/B \u2192 G/P , the natural projection from the flag\nvariety to the partial flag variety of parabolic subgroups of type I. Two orbits O, O\u2032 in\nK\\G/B are I-equivalent (write O \u223cI O\u2032 ) if they project to the same K-orbit on G/P ; i.e.\n\u03c0I (O) = \u03c0I (O\u2032 ). The I-equivalence class of O is\n[O]\u223cI = K\\\u03c0I\u22121 (\u03c0I (O)).\nIn [PSY], each I-equivalence class Kv0 P = \u222aO\u223cI Ov0 O is shown to be in bijection with\nsome double coset space v0 M\\L/B \u2229 L. The idea of considering such a bijection is due to\nLusztig-Vogan, according to [Mat82], p. 313. Note that these are v0 M-orbits on L/B \u2229 L,\nthe flag variety of L. The bijection permits a generalization of the following commonly used\ntechnique: when computing Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials, often, the first step is to first\nmake use of polynomials arising from smaller root subsystems. For example, to compute type\nA3 polynomials, begin by finding copies of A2 within A3 . Furthermore, the subgroup v0 M is\na spherical subgroup of L and thus there is a unique open dense orbit in v0 M\\L/B \u2229 L. The\nbijection of I-equivalence classes with double coset spaces respects Bruhat order. Therefore,\neach I-equivalence class has a unique maximal element since v0 M\\L/B \u2229 L has a unique\nmaximal element. These maximal elements are easy to specify combinatorially, giving us\na succinct parametrization of K\\G/P . We now proceed to provide more details. Because\nwe study orbits of different subgroups on different flag varieties, we use superscripts to\ndifferentiate the different orbit types by subgroup.\nDefinition 9.3. ([PSY]) Consider a parabolic subgroup and Levi decomposition P = LN\nwhere L carries an involution \u0398 (which may not be defined on G). A mixed subgroup of G\nis a subgroup of the form M = L\u0398 N.\nRemark 9.4.\nMixed subgroups generalize K, B, and P as follows. Select P = G and \u0398 = \u03b8, then M = K.\nSelect P = B and \u0398 = Id, then M = B. Select P = P and \u0398 = Id, then M = P .\nProposition 9.5. ([PSY]) There is a bijection M\\G/B \u2194 L\u0398 \\L/B \u2229 L \u00d7 WL \\WG . More\nspecifically,\nM\\G/B \u2194 L\u0398 \\L/B \u2229 L \u00d7WL WG\nwhere the fibre product is with respect to the cross action of WL on L\u0398 \\L/B \u2229 L.\nRemark 9.6. Our double cosets are in bijection with a smaller K\\G/B cross a Weyl group\nquotient.\nCorollary 9.7. Mixed subgroups are spherical subgroups.\nDefinition 9.8. ([PSY]) Cross actions and Cayley transforms on M\\G/B may be defined by\n\u22121\nmultiplying orbit representatives on the right by \u1e61\u22121\n\u03b1 and by z\u03b1 , respectively, as before.\nAs mentioned, an application of the theory of mixed subgroups is a bijection between\norbits in an I-equivalence class and mixed subgroup orbits on the flag variety for a Levi\nsubgroup.\nTheorem 9.9. ([PSY]) Given an I-equivalence class [OgM ]\u223cI of M-orbits on G/B, there exists\na mixed subgroup g M of L and a bijection\ng\n\n\u03c8\n\nM\\L/B \u2229 L \u2212\n\u2192 M\\gP/B = [OgM ]\u223cI\n22\n\n\fsuch that the following diagram commutes:\nL\n\n> g M\\L/B \u2229 L\n\u03c8\n> \u2228\nM\\gP/B.\n\nThe unlabelled maps are the natural maps arising by choosing orbit representatives from L\nand from gL. Furthermore,\n\u0001\n\u0001\ng\ng\n\u03c8 s\u03b1 \u00d7 Ol M = s\u03b1 \u00d7 \u03c8 Ol M\n\u0001\u0001\n\u0001\u0001\ng\ng\nand\n\u03c8 c\u03b1 Ol M\n= c\u03b1 \u03c8 Ol M .\nIn the case where M = K, we may set:\n\ng = v0 \u2208 V to be a representative for [OvK0 ]\u223cI of minimal dimension\n\u03b8\u0303 = int(v0\u22121 ) \u25e6 \u03b8 \u25e6 int(v0 )\nJ = {\u03b1 \u2208 S : \u03b1v0 is real or imaginary} \u222a {\u03b1 \u2208 S : \u03b1v0 is complex and \u03b8(\u03b1v0 ) \u2208 Sv0 }.\nPJI = LJ NJI the T -stable Levi decomposition of the parabolic subgroup of L corresponding to J\n(5) v0 M = L\u03b8\u0303J NJI .\n\n(1)\n(2)\n(3)\n(4)\n\nRemark 9.10. I-equivalence permits us to decompose any M\\G/B into unions of smaller\nmixed subgroup double coset spaces. In particular, iterating I-equivalence to simplify computations does not introduce any type of subgroup beyond mixed subgroups. For this reason\nand since we may develop a rich theory for mixed subgroups (parametrizing orbits and understanding Bruhat order very explicitly), we choose to use g M in bijections even though\nthere are other subgroups for which bijections with the orbits in an I-equivalence class are\nsimpler to prove.\nRemark 9.11. Compare this theorem and Proposition 9.5 with Brion and Helminck's parametrization of an I-equivalence class in the symmetric case, i.e. the B-orbits in KgP , in Proposition\n4 of section 1.5 of [BH00]. They set Vg to be {x \u2208 L \u2229 \u03b8\u0303(L) : x\u22121 \u03b8\u0303(x) \u2208 NL (T ) \u2229 \u03b8\u0303(L)} and\nNg = {n \u2208 NL (T ) : B \u2229 L \u2229 \u03b8\u0303(L) \u2282 n(B \u2229 L)n\u22121 }. Then\nL\u03b8\u0303 \\Vg /T \u00d7 Ng /T \u2194 [OgK ]\u223cI .\nThe first term in the product is a smaller K\\G/B while Brion-Helminck show the second\nterm to be in bijection with orbits on L/B \u2229 L of the semidirect product of the unipotent\nradical of \u03b8\u0303(P ) \u2229 L with L\u03b8\u0303 . That subgroup is not usually a mixed subgroup nor a parabolic\nsubgroup of L. Brion and Helminck do not impose the condition that OgK is a minimal\ndimension equivalence class representative.\nAgain, we saw that mixed subgroups are spherical subgroups. Thus:\nCorollary 9.12. Each I-equivalence class of orbits has a unique orbit maximal with respect\nto Bruhat order. Thus each P -orbit KvP contains a unique dense B-orbit.\nRemark 9.13. This is equivalent to Proposition 2 of section 1.2 of [BH00].\n23\n\n\f9.3. Parametrizing K\\G/P . There is a simple combinatorial parametrization of the unique\ndense orbits in each I-equivalence class, and hence of K\\G/P .\nTheorem 9.14. Let I \u2282 \u03a0 correspond to the standard parabolic P . Then the double coset\nspace K\\G/P is in bijection with VP where\nVP := {v \u2208 V : for every \u03b1 \u2208 I, w\u03b8\u03b1 < 0 where w = v \u22121 \u03b8(v)T }\n= {v \u2208 V : for every \u03b1 \u2208 I, m(s\u03b1 )v = v}.\nIn other words, K\\G/P is in bijection with the I-maximal elements of V .\nProof. This follows immediately from the proposition and the corollary above and our characterization of Bruhat order for K\\G/B.\n\u0003\nRemark 9.15. In comparison, P \\G/B is in bijection with W I := {w \u2208 WG : w\u03b1 >\n0 for every \u03b1 \u2208 I}, the P -minimal elements of WG . As discussed, P \\G/B is in bijection\nwith the unique maximal length coset representatives as well, giving us a parametrization\nanalogous to our parametrization of K\\G/P . We may think of K\\G/P as the P -maximal\nelements of K\\G/B.\nProposition 9.16. (cf. Proposition 5.3) Let u, v \u2208 VP . Then\nKuP \u0016 KvP \u21d0\u21d2 KuB \u0016 KvB.\nProof. \u21d0: This is clear from Lemma 3.9.\n\u21d2: Since KvB is dense in \u03c0I\u22121 (KvP ), KuB \u2282 \u03c0I\u22121 (KuP ) \u2282 \u03c0I\u22121 KvP \u2282 KvB.\n\n\u0003\n\nRemark 9.17. This short topological proof works for P \\G/B as well.\n9.4. Behaviour of Simple Relations: Descent of the Monoidal Action. Since Bruhat\norder for K\\G/P is induced from Bruhat order on K\\G/B, which can be described using\nsimple relations, one concludes that Bruhat order for K\\G/P can be described using simple\nrelations as well. However, the absence of a Borel subgroup among the two subgroups\nwith respect to which we take double cosets complicates matters somewhat, obstructing the\n\u03b1\npossibility of making a natural definition for \u2212\n\u2192 consistent among all coset representatives.\nProposition 9.18.\n\n(1) If \u03b1 \u2208 I, then \u1e61\u03b1 , z\u03b1 \u2208 L \u2282 P ; thus\n\u03c0I (v) = \u03c0I (m(s\u03b1 )v) for all v \u2208 V.\n\n(2) If \u03b1 \u2208 \u03a0 \\ I,\n\u03c0I (v) 6= \u03c0I (m(s\u03b1 )v) \u21d0\u21d2 v 6= m(s\u03b1 )v.\nProof. This follows immediately from Proposition 9.9.\nThus we may restrict our attention to simple relations in K\\G/B for \u03b1 \u2208 \u03a0 \\ I.\nWe consider defining cross action to be s\u03b1 \u00d7 KvP = Kv \u1e61\u22121\n\u03b1 P . Since for w \u2208 WL ,\ns \u00d7\n\n\u22121\nKv \u1e61\u22121\n\u03b1 B \u2282 Kv \u1e61\u03b1 P\n\ns \u00d7\n\nKvw \u1e61\u22121\n\u03b1 B\n\nKvB\n\n\u03b1\n\u2212\u2212\n\u2192\n\nKvwB\n\n\u03b1\n\u2212\u2212\n\u2192\n\ns\n\n\u00d7\n\nw\n\u03b1\n\u22121\nKvwB \u2212\u2212\n\u2212\u2212\n\u2192 Kv \u1e61\u22121\n\u03b1 wB \u2282 Kv \u1e61\u03b1 P,\n\u22121\n\nwe see that the cross action does not descend naturally from K\\G/B to K\\G/P .\n24\n\n\u0003\n\n\fLemma 9.19. For \u03b1 \u2208 \u03a0 \\ I, L normalizes N, so WL \u03b1 \u2282 \u2206(n, t).\n(1) For any w \u2208 WL , the coefficient of \u03b1 in the expression of w\u03b1 as a linear combination\nof simple roots is 1.\n(2) If \u03b2 \u2208 WL \u03b1 is a simple root, then \u03b2 = \u03b1.\nProposition 9.20. If w \u2208 WL , \u03b1 \u2208 \u03a0 \\ I, and v \u2208 VP , then\nP\nP\nOm(s\n= Om(s\n.\nw\u03b1 )v\n\u03b1 )v\n\nProof. By Lemma 9.19 and Lemma 5.3.3 of [Yee05], there is a reduced expression of sw\u03b1 of\nthe form s1 * * * sk s\u03b1 sk * * * s1 where the si \u2208 WL . Since v is maximal, m(sk * * * s1 )v = v. Then\nm(sw\u03b1 )v = m(s1 * * * sk )m(s\u03b1 )m(sk * * * s1 )v = m(s1 * * * sk )m(s\u03b1 )v. Since the monoidal action\nby WL preserves P -orbits, the proposition follows.\n\u0003\nProposition 9.21. Let v \u2208 VP and u \u2208 V with u \u223cI v. Let w \u2208 WL be of minimal length\nP\nP\nP\nsuch that v = m(w)u.

It is tempting at this point, but incorrect, to conclude that the monoidal\naction of WG on K\\G/B descends naturally to a monoidal action on K\\G/P as follows:\n?\n\n\u2022 m(sw\u03b1 )v = m(ws\u03b1 w \u22121)m(w)u = m(w)m(s\u03b1 )u.\nP\nP\nP\nP\nP\nP\n\u2022 Om(s\n= Om(s\nand Om(w)m(s\nOm(s\nso by Proposition 9.20, Om(s\n= Om(s\n.\nw\u03b1 )v\n\u03b1 )v\n\u03b1 )u\n\u03b1 )u\n\u03b1 )v\n\u03b1 )u\nHowever, we cannot cancel inverses in M(WG ), so the above argument is incorrect.

Assume by contradiction that m(s\u03b1 )v and m(s\u03b2 )v belong to the same P -orbit. Then\nthere exist minimal length elements w\u03b1 , w\u03b2 \u2208 WL such that m(w\u03b1 s\u03b1 )v = m(w\u03b1 )m(s\u03b1 )v =\nm(w\u03b2 )m(s\u03b2 )v = m(w\u03b2 s\u03b2 )v \u2208 V P . Then by Corollary 8.34, w\u03b1 s\u03b1 = w\u03b2 s\u03b2 which implies that\ns\u03b1 s\u03b2 = w\u03b1\u22121w\u03b2 \u2208 WL , giving s\u03b1 = s\u03b2 \u2013contradiction.\n\u0003\n10. Conclusion\nIt would be interesting to apply the simplifications of Bruhat order to the study of\nKazhdan-Lusztig-Vogan polynomials. The theory of parabolic Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials\nappears the most likely to benefit from the simplifications.\nAnother topic for future consideration is to further explore the philosophy of proving\nresults for P \\G/B and for K\\G/B by reducing to B\\G/B using our analogies for simple\nrelations. For example, can it be applied to develop a better understanding of the exchange\nproperty and the deletion condition for K\\G/B?\nCan the theory for K\\G/B be simplified by using the Tits group?\nCan the theories for K\\G/P and P \\G/B be made more similar by recasting results for\nP \\G/B using maximal length representatives rather than minimal length representatives?\nThe reader will find more material on Bruhat order in [PSY]. In particular, it contains a\ndescription of Bruhat order for mixed subgroups (for which parabolic subgroups and symmetric subgroups are a special case) and for situations where one of the subgroups with respect\n25\n\n\fto which we take double cosets is twisted by conjugation. The descriptions of Bruhat order\nthrough pullbacks of roots in particular carries over to the twisted case very naturally.\n\nReferences\n[AD09]\n[Ada]\n[BB05]\n[BH00]\n[CC87]\n[dC]\n[Deo77]\n[DM91]\n[Hum75]\n[Hum90]\n[Hum95]\n[Kna02]\n[Kno95]\n[LV83]\n[Mat82]\n[PSY]\n[RS90]\n[RW10]\n[Spr85]\n\n[Spr09]\n[Ste74]\n[Ste02]\n[Vog83]\n\nJeffrey D.
