Dark energy (DE)\nin form of either cosmological constant or scalar field\nmatter is a candidate answer to the acceleration expansion which could not be explained in the regime of standard big bang cosmology [4]. DE possesses equation of\nstate p = w\u03c1 with w < \u22121/3 enabling it to give repulsive\ngravity and therefore accelerate the universe. Combination of observational data analysis of CMB, Hubble Space\nTelescope, type Ia Supernovae and 2dF datasets allows\nconstant w value between -1.38 and -0.82 at the 95 %\nof confident level [5]. Meanwhile, assuming flat universe,\nthe analysis result, \u22121.06 < w < \u22120.90 has been reported by [6] using WMAP three-year results combined\nwith Supernova Legacy Survey (SNLS) data. Without\nassumption of flat universe, mean value of w is -1.06\n(within a range of -1.14 to -0.93). Most recent data (flat\ngeometry assumption) from ESSENCE Supernova Survey Ia combined with SuperNova Legacy Survey Ia gives\na constraint of w = \u22121.07 \u00b1 0.09 [7]. Observations above\nshow a possibility that a fluid with w < \u22121 could be allowed in the universe [8]. This type of cosmological fluid\nis dubbed phantom. Conventionally Phantom behavior\narises from having negative kinetic energy term.\nDynamical properties of the phantom field in the standard FRW cosmology were studied before. However the\nscenario encounters singularity problems at late time\n[9, 10]. While investigation of phantom in standard\ncosmological model is still ongoing, there is an alternative approach in order to resolve the singularity problem by considering phantom field evolving in Loop Quantum Cosmology (LQC) background instead of standard\ngeneral relativistic background [11, 12]. Loop Quantum\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\naddress: buring@nu.ac.th\n\nGravity-LQG is a non-perturbative type of quantization\nof gravity and is background-independent [13, 14]. LQG\nprovides cosmological background evolution for LQC. An\neffect from loop quantum modification gives an extra correction term \u2212\u03c12 /\u03c1lc into the standard Friedmann equation [15, 16, 17]. Problem for standard cosmology in domination of phantom field is that it leads to singularity, so\ncalled the Big Rip [18]. The \u2212\u03c12 /\u03c1lc term, when dominant at late time, causes bouncing of expansion hence\nsolving Big Rip singularity problem [14, 19, 20]. Recently, a general dynamics of scalar field including phantom scalar field coupled to barotropic fluid has been investigated in standard cosmological background. In this\nscenario, the scaling solution of the coupled phantom\nfield is always unstable and it can not yield the observed\nvalue \u03a9\u03c6 \u223c 0.7 [21]. Indeed there should be other effects\nfrom loop quantum correction to the Friedmann equation. Moreover when including potential term in scalar\nfield density, the quantum modification must be included\n[22]. Although, the Friedmann background is valid only\nin absence of field potential, however, investigation of\na phantom field evolving under a potential could reveal\nsome interesting features of the model. In this letter,\nwe investigate a case of coupled phantom field in LQC\nbackground in alternative to the standard relativistic cosmology case. In Section II, we introduce framework of\ncosmological equations before considering dynamical autonomous equations in Section III. We show some numerical results in Section IV where the coupling strength\nis adjusted and compared. Conclusion and comments are\nin Section V.\n\n\f2\nII.\n\nCOSMOLOGICAL EQUATIONS\nA.\n\nLoop quantum cosmology\n\nThe effective flat universe Friedmann equation from\nLQC is given as [15, 17],\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u03c1\n\u03c1\n1\n\u2212\n,\n(1)\nH2 =\n3MP2\n\u03c1lc\nwhere H is Hubble constant, MP is\u221a\nreduced Planck mass,\n\u03c1 is density of cosmic fluid, \u03c1lc = 3/(16\u03c0\u03b6 3 G2 ~). The\nparameter \u03b6 is Barbero-Immirzi dimensionless parameter\nand G is the Newton's gravitational constant.\nB.\n\nPhantom scalar field\n\nNature of the phantom field can be extracted from action,\n\u0015\n\u0014\nZ\n1 a\n4 \u221a\n(2)\nS = d x \u2212g (\u2202 \u03c6)(\u2202a \u03c6) \u2212 V (\u03c6) .\n2\nEnergy density and pressure are given by\n1\n\u03c1\u03c6 = \u2212 \u03c6\u03072 + V (\u03c6),\n2\n\n(3)\n\n1\np\u03c6 = \u2212 \u03c6\u03072 \u2212 V (\u03c6),\n2\n\n(4)\n\nand\n\n(the phantom scalar field) as in [24]. Eqs. (6) and (7)\ncan also be assumed as conservation equations of fluids\nin the LQC. Total action for matter and phantom scalar\nfield is [23]\n\u0014 2\n\u0015\nZ\nMP\n4 \u221a\nS = d x \u2212g\nR + p(X, \u03c6) + Sm (\u03c6) .\n(8)\n2\nAssuming scaling solution of the dark energy in standard\ncosmology, the pressure Lagrangian density is written as\np(X, \u03c6) = \u2212X \u2212 c exp(\u2212\u03bb\u03c6/MP2 ) ,\n\n(9)\n\nwhere X is the kinetic term, \u2212g ab \u2202a \u03c6\u2202b \u03c6/2 of the Lagrangian density (2) and (9). The second term on\nthe right of Eq. (9) is exponential potential, V (\u03c6) =\nc exp(\u2212\u03bb\u03c6/MP2 ) which gives scaling solution for canonical and phantom ordinary scalar field in standard general\nrelativistic cosmology when steepness of the potential, \u03bb\nis fine tuned as\n\u03bb=Q\n\n1 + wm \u2212 \u03a9\u03c6 (wm \u2212 w\u03c6 )\n.\n\u03a9\u03c6 (wm \u2212 w\u03c6 )\n\n(10)\n\nThe steepness (10) is, in standard cosmological circumstance, constant in the scaling regime due to constancy\nof w\u03c6 and \u03a9\u03c6 [21, 23]. However, in LQC case, there has\nbeen a report recently that the scaling solution does not\nexist for phantom field evolving in LQC [11]. Therefore\nour spirit to consider constant \u03bb is the same as in [25]\nnot a motivation from scaling solution as in [23]. The\nexponential potential is also originated from fundamental physics theories such as higher-order gravity [26] or\nhigher dimensional gravity [27].\n\nwith equation of state,\np\u03c6\n\u03c6\u03072 + 2V (\u03c6)\nw\u03c6 \u2261\n.\n=\n\u03c1\u03c6\n\u03c6\u03072 \u2212 2V (\u03c6)\n\nIII.\n\n(5)\n\nWhen the field is slowly rolling, the approximate value\nof w is -1. As long as the approximation, \u03c6\u03072 \u223c 0 or the\ncondition, \u03c6\u03072 < 2V holds, w is always less than -1. In\nour scenario, the universe contains two fluid components.\nThese are barotropic fluid with equation of state pm =\n\u03c1m wm and phantom scalar field fluid. The total density\nis then \u03c1 = \u03c1m + \u03c1\u03c6 which governs total dynamics of the\nuniverse.\nC.\n\nCoupled phantom scalar field\n\nHere we consider both components coupling to each\nother.

The solutions presented here are physically valid solutions corresponding to Class II solutions\ncharacterized in [11]. For non-minimally coupled scalar\nfield\u221a\nin Einstein frame\n\u221a [30], the coupling Q lies in a range\n\u22121/ 6 < Q < 1/ 6. Here we set Q = \u22120.4, \u22120.1, 0.1\nand 0.4 which lie in the range. Effect of the coupling can\nbe seen from Eqs. (6) and (7). Negative Q enhances decay rate of scalar field to matter while giving higher matter creation rate. On the other hand, positive Q yields\nopposite result. Greater magnitude of Q < 0 gives higher\ndecay rate of the field to matter. Greater magnitude of\nQ > 0 will result in higher production rate of phantom\nfield from matter.\n\nQ = 0.4\n\n4\n\nQ = 0.1\nQ =-0.1\nQ =-0.4\n\n3\n\na\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\n3\n\nNUMERICAL SOLUTIONS\n\n3.5\n\nt\n\nFIG. 2:\nScale factor plotted versus time for Q\n\u22120.4, \u22120.1, 0.1 and 0.4 (from bottom to top).\n\nA.\n=\n\nThe Eqs. (13), (14), (15) and (16) form a closed autonomous set of four equations. The variables here are\n\u03c1m , S, \u03c6 and H. The autonomous set recovers standard\ngeneral relativistic cosmology in the limit \u03c1lc \u2192 \u221e. The\ngeneral relativistic limit affects only the equation involving H. From the above autonomous set, one can do a\nqualitative analysis with numerical integration similar to\nphase plane presented in different situation [28]. Another\napproach of analysis is to consider a quantitative analysis\n[29].\n\nPhase portrait\n\nThe greater Q value results in greater value of the field\nturning point (see \u03c6-intercept in Fig. 1). The kinetic\nterm S(t) turns negative at the turning points corresponding to the field rolling down and then halting before\nrolling up the hill of exponential potential. When Q is\ngreater, the field can fall down further, hence gaining\nmore total energy. The result agrees with the prediction\nof Eqs. (6) and (7).\n\nB.\n\nScale factor\n\nFrom Fig. 2, the bounce in scale factor occurs later for\ngreater Q value of which the phantom field production\nrate is higher. The field has more phantom energy to\n\n\f4\naccelerate the universe in counteracting the effect of loop\nquantum (the bounce). For less positive Q, the phantom\nproduction rate is smaller, and for negative Q, the phantom decays. Therefore it has less energy for accelerating\nthe expansion in counteracting with the loop quantum\neffect. This makes the bounce occurs sooner.\n\n1\n\n0.8\n\n0.6\n\nSm\nC.\n\nEnergy density\n\nQ = -0.4\n\n0.4\n\nQ = -0.1\n\nTime evolutions of energy density of the matter and\nthe phantom field are presented in Figs. 3 and 4. If Q >\n0, the matter decays to phantom. This reduces density\nof matter. While for Q < 0, the matter gains its density\nfrom decaying of phantom field. In Fig. 3 there is a\nbounce of phantom density before undergoing oscillation.\nFor a non-coupled case, it has recently been reported that\nthe phantom density also undergoes oscillation [11]. As\nseen in Figs. 4 and 5, the oscillation in phantom density\nof the phantom decay case (Q < 0) affects in oscillation in\nmatter density while for the case of matter decay (Q > 0),\nthe matter density is reduced for stronger coupling. The\noscillation in the phantom density comes from oscillation\nof the kinetic term \u03c6\u0307, i.e. S(t) as shown in [11].\n\n0.2\n\nFig. 5\n\nQ = 0.1\n\n0\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\n3\n\nQ = 0.4\n\nt\n\nFIG. 4: Matter density plotted versus time for Q =\n\u22120.4, \u22120.1, 0.1 and 0.4 (from top to bottom).\n0.2\n\nQ = -0.4\n\n0.15\n\nV.\n\nCONCLUSION AND COMMENTS\n\nIn this letter, we have derived an autonomous system\nof a loop quantum cosmological equations in presence of\nphantom scalar field coupling to barotropic matter fluid.\nWe choose constant coupling Q between matter and the\nphantom field to positive and negative values and check\nnumerically the effect of Q values on (1) phase portrait,\n(2) scale factor and (3) energy density of phantom field\nand matter. We found that field value tends to roll up\nthe hill of potential due to phantom nature. With greater\nQ, the field can fall down on the potential further. This\nincreases total energy of the field. For canonical scalar\nfield either standard or phantom, LQC yields a bounce.\nThe bounce is useful since it is able to avoid Big Bang\nsingularity in the early universe. Here our numerical result shows a bouncing in scale factor at late time. This is\na Type I singularity avoidance even in presence of phantom energy. The greater coupling results in more and\nmore phantom density. Greater phantom effect therefore\ndelays the bounce, which is LQC effect, to later time. In\nthe case of matter decay to phantom (Q > 0), oscillation in phantom energy density does not affect matter\ndensity. On the other hand, when Q < 0, phantom decays to matter, oscillation in phantom density results in\noscillation in the increasing matter density.\nThis work considers only the effects of sign and magnitude of the coupling constant to qualitative dynamics\nand evolution of the system. Studies of field dependent\neffects of coupling Q(\u03c6) in some scalar-tensor theory of\ngravity and investigation of an evolution of effective equation of state could also yield further interesting features\n\nSm\n0.1\n\n0.05\nQ = -0.1\nQ = 0.1\nQ = 0.4\n\n0\n2.5\n\n2.6\n\n2.7\n\n2.8\n\n2.9\n\n3\n\n3.1\n\nt\n\nFIG. 5: Zoom-in portion of Fig. 4. The phantom field decays\nto matter at highest rate for Q = \u22120.4 (top line). Oscillation in matter density due to oscillation in the phantom field\ndensity is seen clearly here.\n\nof the model. Quantitative dynamical analysis of the\nmodel under different types of potential is also motivated\nfor future work. Frequency function of the oscillation in\nscale factor and phantom density are still unknown in\ncoupled case. It looks like that the oscillation frequency\ntends to increase. This could lead to infinite frequency\nof oscillation which is another new singularity.\nAcknowledgements: B. G. is grateful to Shinji Tsujikawa for discussion.
