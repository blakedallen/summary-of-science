The first is based\non causal structure and defines the black hole region to be the set of all points that\ncannot send signals to future infinity. This region is the causal black hole and its\nboundary is an event horizon[1]. The second characterization is geometric, defining\nthe black hole region to be the union of all trapped surfaces in a spacetime. This\nis the total trapped region or prison\u2021 (alternatively if one works from outer trapped\nsurfaces it is the outer prison). The third is also geometric and tries to characterize the\nboundary rather than the interior of a black hole. Black hole boundaries are identified\nas (outer) marginally trapped surfaces. These boundaries are variously known as\ntrapping [2], isolated or dynamical horizons [3]. Each of these characterizations has its\nown strengths and weaknesses and though they are all equivalent for the Kerr-Newman\nfamily of solutions, for more general spacetimes they are generally not equivalent.\nThe inequivalence of the definitions has been most intensively studied for the\nVaidya spacetimes [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]. Standard theorems governing (outer) trapped\nsurfaces in asymptotically flat spacetimes guarantee that both the prison and outer\nprison are contained within the causal black hole [1]. However, in the aforementioned\npapers it was demonstrated that while the outer prison saturates that region for\nVaidya solutions, the boundary of the prison is not the event horizon. Similarly\n\u2021 A nomenclature suggested by Don Page (private communication).\n\n\fTrapped and marginally trapped surfaces in Weyl-distorted Schwarzschild solutions 2\ndespite the original intent of characterizing dynamical black hole boundaries with\ntrapping [2] or dynamical horizons, these studies demonstrate that the boundary of\nthe (outer) prison is not one of these surfaces. Instead it turns out that horizons\nof these types are generically intersected by trapped surfaces. Further, by general\ngeometric arguments, dynamical marginally (outer) trapped tubes can be shown to\nbe non-rigid and may be continuously deformed [9, 10, 11]. This non-uniqueness can\nbe concretely demonstrated in the Vaidya spacetimes by direct numerical calculations\nwhich locate a variety of (intersecting) dynamical horizons [5]; this is an example of\nthe well-known fact that apparent horizons are foliation dependent.\nThus, at least for dynamical spacetimes, black hole characterization is\ncomplicated. In this paper we take a couple of steps backwards and instead consider\nthe corresponding situation for static spacetimes. One might hope that things will be\nmore straightforward in these cases. To test this hope we study a class of Weyl\nspacetimes [12] that represent distortions of a Schwarzschild black hole (see, for\nexample [13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20]). No matter the strength of the distortion,\nthere is always an isolated horizon in these spacetimes which encloses trapped surfaces\nand a singularity. Thus they are good geometric black hole candidates though in their\npure vacuum form these spacetimes are not asymptotically flat and so do not contain\nan event horizon or causal black hole.\nThe paper is organized in the following manner. Section 2 reviews the\nmathematics of trapped and marginally trapped surfaces along with the definitions\nand properties of the related quasilocal horizons. Section 3 discusses the Weyldistorted Schwarzschild solutions and confirms that they always contain singularities\nand trapped surfaces. Section 4 then identifies the isolated horizon in those spacetimes\nand finds the conditions under which it becomes either a marginally trapped surface or\nfuture outer trapping horizon. The general solution is quite complicated so Section 5\nbegins by examining some specific examples of distortions and foliations to help build\nour understanding. It then proceeds to examine quadrupole distortions in some detail\nand prove that for large distortions the isolated horizon is neither marginally trapped\nnor a future outer trapping horizon. Finally, Section 6 considers the implications of\nour result.\n2. Background\n2.1. Trapped and marginally trapped surfaces\nLet (M, gab ) be a four-dimensional time-orientable spacetime and let S be a twodimensional spacelike surface. We assume that there is a good way to distinguish\nthe inside and outside of S\u00a7. Then we can assign ` and n to respectively be futureoriented outward- and inward-pointing normal vectors. We cross-normalize them so\nthat ` * n = \u22121. These conditions do not fully fix the scaling. Given any function F ,\nif ` and n are properly oriented and cross-normalized then the null vectors\n` \u2192 eF ` and n \u2192 e\u2212F n\n\n(1)\n\nalso satisfy those conditions. The projection operator for this surface is\nq\u0303ab = gab + `a nb + na `b\nand q\u0303\n\nab\n\n(2)\n\nis also the push-forward of the induced two-metric on S.\n\n\u00a7 Any notion of asymptotic infinity is sufficient as in that case the outside can be deemed to be the\nside facing infinity. In our examples the outside will be that facing r \u2192 \u221e.\n\n\fTrapped and marginally trapped surfaces in Weyl-distorted Schwarzschild solutions 3\nFor these normals, the outgoing and ingoing null expansions are\n\u03b8(`) = q\u0303 ab \u2207a `b and \u03b8(n) = q\u0303 ab \u2207a nb .\n\n(3)\n\nEquivalently we may write these in terms of the variation of the two-metric under\ndeformations:\n1\n1\n(`)\n(n)\n(4)\n\u03b4` q\u0303ab = \u03b8(`) q\u0303ab + \u03c3ab and \u03b4n q\u0303ab = \u03b8(n) q\u0303ab + \u03c3ab ,\n2\n2\n(`)\n\n(n)\n\nwhere the trace-free parts of the deformation are the shears: \u03c3ab and \u03c3ab . In\ngeneral, \u03b4X \u03a8 for some vector field X and geometric quantity \u03a8 is calculated by:\n1) infinitesimally deforming S in the direction X, 2) calculating \u03a8 on the deformed\nsurface and then 3) calculating the rate of change of \u03a8 with respect to this deformation.\nSuch variations are standard in differential geometry however a discussion of them\nusing the same language and notation as this paper may be found in [11].\nFor a sphere in Minkowski space, one would expect \u03b8(`) > 0 and \u03b8(n) < 0: that\nis, area increases for outward deformations and decreases for inward ones. Thus there\nis clearly something unusual happening if \u03b8(`) < 0 and in this case we say that S is\nouter trapped. If both \u03b8(`) < 0 and \u03b8(n) < 0 then we say that S is (fully) trapped\n(the variation of area is negative in all normal directions). There are also borderline\ncases. S is a marginally outer trapped surface (MOTS) if \u03b8(`) = 0 and a marginally\ntrapped surface (MTS) if \u03b8(`) = 0 and \u03b8(n) < 0. The signs of the expansions (and so\nthe classification) are not affected by the scaling of the null vectors. Under a rescaling\n(1), \u03b8(`) \u2192 eF \u03b8(`) and \u03b8(n) \u2192 e\u2212F \u03b8(n) .\nThe full extrinsic geometry of a two-surface is fixed by the expansions \u03b8(`) and\n(`)\n\n(n)\n\n\u03b8(n) and shears \u03c3ab and \u03c3ab along with the curvature of the normal bundle\n\u03a9ab = da \u03c9\u0303b \u2212 db \u03c9\u0303a ,\n\n(5)\n\nwhere da is the induced covariant derivative on S and\n\u03c9\u0303a = \u2212q\u0303ab nc \u2207b `c\n\n(6)\n\nis the connection on the normal bundle. The connection is perhaps better known as the\nangular momentum one-form because for an isolated horizon the angular momentum\nassociated with a rotational Killing vector field \u03c6a is\nZ\n1\n\u000f \u0303 (\u03c6a \u03c9\u0303a ) .\n(7)\nJ\u03c6 =\n8\u03c0 S\nIt is not hard to see that if \u03a9ab = 0 then the angular momentum associated with any\nsuch \u03c6a vanishes: the horizon is non-rotating. Note too that under rescalings (1) the\nconnection transforms as\n\u03c9\u0303a \u2192 \u03c9\u0303a + da F\n\n(8)\n\nwhile the curvature is invariant (as of course it should be).\nIn classifying the surfaces, the variations of the expansions are also of interest\n(these are essentially second derivatives of the area-forms). For vacuum spacetimes\nand marginally outer trapped surfaces we find [11]:\n(`)\n\nab\n\u03b4` \u03b8(`) = \u2212\u03c3ab \u03c3(`)\n\n(9)\n\nand\n\u03b4n \u03b8(`) = \u2212\n\nR\u0303\n\u2212 da \u03c9\u0303 a + \u03c9\u0303 a \u03c9\u0303a\n2\n\n(10)\n\n\fTrapped and marginally trapped surfaces in Weyl-distorted Schwarzschild solutions 4\nwhere R\u0303 is the Ricci curvature of S.

By Hayward's classification [2] a MOTS is an\nouter trapping surface if there exists a scaling of the null vectors such that \u03b4n \u03b8(`) < 0k.\nSimilarly if one is considering a MOTS which is contained in a spacelike hypersurface\n\u03a3 (essentially an apparent horizon on \u03a3), then it is said to be strictly stably outermost\nif \u03b4X \u03b8(`) < 0 for some inward-pointing spacelike X which is normal S but parallel to\n\u03a3 [21]. In both cases the extra condition is imposed to ensure that the MOTS may\nbe infinitesimally deformed into an outer trapped surface. That is, the MOTS is the\nlimit of a sequence of outer trapped surfaces. Similarly one may consider marginally\ntrapped surfaces that can be infinitesimally deformed into fully trapped surfaces. Such\nsurfaces have \u03b8(`) = 0, \u03b8(n) < 0 and \u03b4n \u03b8(`) < 0 and by Hayward's classification are\ncalled future outer trapping surfaces.\n2.2. Stationary black hole boundaries\nTurning to black hole boundaries, a three-surface H foliated by two-surfaces (S\u03bb , q\u0303ab )\nis a trapping horizon if the S\u03bb are all marginally outer trapped [2]. In this paper we\nare only interested in stationary horizons in vacuum and so immediately specialize to\nthe case where H is null with normal `a (and tangent `a ): then H is a non-expanding\nhorizon [22]. By (4) and (9) and scaling `a = (d/d\u03bb)a we have\nL` q\u0303ab = \u03b4` q\u0303ab = 0 ;\n\n(13)\n\nthat is, the induced metric on the leaves of the horizon is invariant in time. More\ngenerally, it is not hard to show that if \u03b8(`) = 0 for one foliation S\u03bb of a non-expanding\nhorizon, then it also vanishes for any other foliation S\u03bb0 . In fact, the intrinsic metric\nq\u0303ab is the same for all possible foliations.\nIf there is a scaling of the null vectors such that\n[L` , Da ] = 0 ,\n\n(14)\n\nwhere Da is the induced covariant derivative on H, then a non-expanding horizon\nbecomes an isolated horizon [22]. For such a scaling not only the intrinsic but also the\nextrinsic geometry of H is invariant in time. For example\n\u03b4` \u03b8(n) = 0 and \u03b4` \u03c9\u0303a = 0 .\n\n(15)\n\nIn many cases, the quickest way to show that a particular null surface is an\nisolated horizon is to instead show that it is a Killing horizon: a null surface H that\nis everywhere tangent to a global Killing vector field \u03be a that reduces to `a on H. It\nis not hard to show that all Killing horizons are also isolated horizons ([22] again).\nThough isolated horizons are mathematically more general than Killing horizons the\nbest known examples, including the event horizons in the Kerr-Newman family of\nblack holes, are also Killing horizons.\nk Note that outer is being used in two different ways in these phrases. For a MOTS, the outer refers\nto the direction in which the surface is marginally trapped while for an outer trapping surface the\nouter is used in analogy with the outer versus inner horizon of a Kerr-Newman black hole.\n\n\fTrapped and marginally trapped surfaces in Weyl-distorted Schwarzschild solutions 5\nIsolated horizons obey a zeroth law. For any scaling of ` satisfying (14), one can\nshow that the surface gravity, defined as the proportionality factor \u03ba satisfying\n`a \u2207a `b = \u03ba`b ,\n\n(16)\n\nis constant over the horizon. Note however that its exact value is not fixed. If ` \u2192 c`\nfor any positive constant c, then \u03ba \u2192 c\u03ba. Thus without some method to choose\na preferred scaling, all we can say for sure is that \u03ba is either positive, negative or\nvanishing. For our purposes this will be enough.\nThe boundaries of stationary black holes are isolated horizons, however the\nexistence of an isolated horizon is not, in itself, sufficient to imply the existence of\na black hole; there are examples of spacetimes that are entirely foliated by isolated\nhorizons, but which certainly do not contain any black hole [23]. Thus, extra conditions\nare necessary and the most obvious possibility is to extrapolate from Kerr-Newman\nand only identify an isolated horizon as a black hole boundary if it bounds a total\ntrapped (or at least an outer trapped) region.\nA quasilocal way to (attempt to) enforce this condition is to require that H\nbe foliated by either outer trapping surfaces (if we want it to bound a region of\nouter trapped surfaces) or future outer trapping surfaces (for a region of fully trapped\nsurfaces). Respectively these are outer trapping horizons (OTHs) and future outer\ntrapping horizons (FOTHs). Note however that, while appealing, in general there is\nno guarantee that these conditions are either necessary or sufficient. This is because\nmost trapped and marginally trapped surfaces are \"wild\" [24]: even for spherically\nsymmetric spacetimes most trapped surfaces are highly irregular and do not share the\nspacetime symmetries. Let us consider the (outer) prison in a little more detail to see\nhow the problems arise.\nFirst, in the introduction we noted that for dynamical spacetimes the boundary\nof the prison is not a trapping horizon. That said, in Vaidya a spherically symmetric\ntrapping horizon certainly exists, is foliated by two-surfaces with both \u03b8(n) < 0 and\n\u03b4n \u03b8(`) < 0 and is contained in the prison. Then it is clear that even though this surface\nsatisfies our conditions and is the uniform limit of a sequence of fully trapped surfaces,\nthere must be other trapped surfaces that intersect and cross it. Thus it is contained\nwithin, rather than bounding, the prison and \u2013 at least for dynamical spacetimes \u2013\nthe conditions are not sufficient to ensure the horizon is truly a boundary.\nThe wildness of the trapped surfaces might also negate necessity. To see this,\nnote that it is possible that each point p on S could individually be the limit of a\nsequence of points {pi } on a distinct set of (outer) trapped surfaces {Si }. Thus each\npoint on S would be arbitrarily close to points on a (outer) trapped surface, however\nthere would be no uniform limiting sequence of such surfaces which works for all p \u2208 S\nsimultaneously. Mathematically, such a situation would be much less convenient than\nthe uniform case. However, as we shall see, that doesn't mean that it can't happen.\nAll of that said the \u03b8(`) = 0, \u03b8(n) < 0 and \u03b4n \u03b8(`) < 0 conditions precisely identify\nthe outer black hole horizon for the Kerr-Newman family of spacetimes. Thus, even\nthough they run into problems for dynamical spacetimes, it is worth investigating how\nthey function for other isolated horizons.\n2.3. Isolated (F)OTHs\nIt is encouraging to note that in contrast to dynamical horizons, isolated outer trapping\nhorizons are rigid. To see this, note that rigidity is determined by whether or not\n\n\fTrapped and marginally trapped surfaces in Weyl-distorted Schwarzschild solutions 6\n\u03b4X \u03b8(`) = 0 has multiple solutions. However, if \u03b4` \u03b8(`) = 0, (12) reduces to become\n0 = \u2212d2 B + 2\u03c9\u0303 a da B \u2212 B\u03b4n \u03b8(`) .\n\n(17)\n\nNow, if \u03b4n \u03b8(`) < 0 then a maximum principle argument shows that the only solution\nin this case is B = 0 [11]. Thus at least one of the problems associated with dynamical\nhorizons falls away.\nWe now consider the work that must be done to decide whether or not a\ngiven isolated horizon is either marginally trapped or a full-fledged FOTH. This is\nsignificantly more involved than showing that a null surface is an isolated horizon.\nTo show that a surface is an isolated horizon one only needs to work with its\nnull normal/tangent `. The particular foliation of H into spacelike two-surfaces is\nirrelevant. This is especially obvious for the subset of Killing horizons. The definition\nof a Killing horizon makes no mention of either the foliation or the other null normal\nn.\nIn contrast \u03b8(n) is only defined in the presence of a foliation. Given `a there are\nmany possible auxillary null one-forms. What selects a particular na is the foliation\nS\u03bb and requirement that na be null, normal to the S\u03bb and in the cotangent space of\nthe horizon. However if all we care about is whether or not \u03b8(n) < 0 everywhere, then\nthe particular scaling of the null vectors doesn't matter: we saw earlier that under the\nstandard rescalings \u03b8(n) \u2192 e\u2212F \u03b8(n) (which won't affect its sign). Thus, demanding\nthat an isolated horizon H be marginally trapped is really a restriction that there\nexist a foliation of H with particular properties. There are no restrictions on how the\nnull normals are scaled.\nBy contrast, requiring that \u03b4n \u03b8(`) < 0 everywhere turns out to depend on the\nscaling alone and is independent of the foliation. To see this, return to (10):\nR\u0303\n\u2212 da \u03c9\u0303 a + \u03c9\u0303 a \u03c9\u0303a .\n2\nThe Ricci scalar and induced covariant derivative da are determined entirely by the\ninduced two-metric on S\u03bb and we have seen that metric is same for all possible\nfoliations of an isolated horizon. Thus, the only possible foliation dependence might\ndwell in the angular momentum one-form \u03c9\u0303a . Here though the properties of isolated\nhorizons again come into play: for an isolated horizon \u03c9\u0303a is fixed up to the addition of\na total derivative irrespective of the foliation (see for example [25, 26]). Equivalently,\nit can be shown that for an isolated horizon\n\u03b4n \u03b8(`) = \u2212\n\n\u03b4A` \u03c9\u0303a = da (A\u03ba(`) ) ,\n\n(18)\n\na generalization of the second equation in (15). That is, under deformations of the\nfoliation, the angular momentum one-form only changes by a total derivative. Such\nchanges in \u03c9\u0303a are indistinguishable from those that arise from rescalings (8). Thus,\nallowing for both refoliations and rescalings is equivalent to just considering rescalings.\nAll possible forms of \u03b4n \u03b8(`) are exhausted by considering a free function F in\n2\na\nab\n\u03b4n\u0304 \u03b8(`)\n \u0304 = \u2212d F + 2\u03c9\u0303 da F + q\u0303 (da F )(db F ) + \u03b4n \u03b8(`) .\n\n(19)\n\nIf there exists an F such that this expression is everywhere negative, then a given\nisolated horizon is an outer trapping horizon. However, if it can be proved that no\nsuch F exists, it isn't.\n\n\fTrapped and marginally trapped surfaces in Weyl-distorted Schwarzschild solutions 7\nSomewhat surprisingly, it turns out these two apparently very distinct problems\nare equivalent [27]. For an isolated horizon, it can be shown (see for example [26, 11])\nthat\nR\u0303\n+ da \u03c9\u0303 a + \u03c9\u0303a \u03c9\u0303 a ,\n(20)\n2\nbut of course this vanishes (15). The reappearance of the Ricci scalar and \u03c9\u0303a terms\nfrom \u03b4n \u03b8(`) is immediately striking, but note the change in sign on the divergence\nterm. This can be handled. Via the Hodge decomposition theorem, it can be shown\nthat there is always a scaling of the null vectors (`o , no ) such that da \u03c9\u0303oa = 0 [26]. Then\nassuming rotational symmetry and scalings ` = eF `o and ` \u0304 = e\u2212F `o (where F respects\nthe symmetries) it is straightforward to show that\n\u03b4` \u03b8(n) = \u2212\u03ba(`) \u03b8(n) \u2212\n\n\u2212 da \u03c9\u0303 a + \u03c9\u0303a \u03c9\u0303 a = da \u03c9\u0304 a + \u03c9\u0304a \u03c9\u0304 a\n\n(21)\n\n\u03ba(`) \u03b8(n) = \u03b4n\u0304 \u03b8(`)\n \u0304 .\n\n(22)\n\nand so\n\nNow, the surface gravity is constant and so if it is positive, \u03b8(n) < 0 if and only if\n\u03b4n\u0304 \u03b8(`)\n \u0304 < 0. Thus if we can find a foliation such that \u03b8(n) is everywhere negative we\nwill know that there also necessarily exists a scaling of the null vectors so that \u03b4n \u03b8(`)\nis everywhere negative. Rotationally symmetric isolated horizons are FOTHs if and\nonly if they are OTHs.\n3. Distorted Schwarzschild spacetime\nThe outer horizons of the family of Kerr-Newman (asymptotically flat, deSitter, or\nanti-deSitter) solutions are all isolated FOTHs. Thus, to examine the utility of\nthese horizons we must consider more general spacetimes. An obvious source of\nsuch examples are the Weyl solutions: it is well-known that all static solutions of\nthe Einstein equations may be written in this form. In particular one can use these\ntechniques to smoothly distort standard black hole spacetimes including Schwarzschild\n[13, 14, 15, 16, 19, 20], Reissner-Nortstr\u00f6m [18] and (the stationary but non-static)\nKerr [17]. In this paper we will focus on Schwarzschild though our discussion makes\nuse of ideas developed for the more general cases.\n3.1. Weyl-distorted Schwarzschild spacetimes\nWeyl-distorted Schwarzschid spacetime takes the form\n\u0013\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u0012\ndr2\n2m\n2\n2\ndt2 + e\u22122U +2V\n+\nr\nd\u03b8\n+ e\u22122U r2 sin2 \u03b8 d\u03c62 .\nds2 = \u2212e2U 1 \u2212\nr\n1 \u2212 2m\nr\n\n(23)\n\nwhere U \u2261 U (r, \u03b8) and V \u2261 V (r, \u03b8) are axisymmetric potentials. From a manipulation\nof the vacuum Einstein equations, it can be seen that U is necessarily a solution\nof the Euclidean R3 Laplace equation (see, for example, the nice discussions in\n[16, 18, 19]). Such solutions may be split into two classes: those that diverge at\ninfinity and those that diverge at the origin. On the gravity side, these correspond\nto distortions respectively induced by either a non-asymptotically flat infinity or a\ndistorted singularity. Here we are interested in solutions that are induced by external\n\n\fTrapped and marginally trapped surfaces in Weyl-distorted Schwarzschild solutions 8\nsources and so discard solutions that diverge at the origin. Then one possible expansion\nof U \u00b6 is given by\n\u0012 \u0013i\n\u221e\nX\nR\nU (r, \u03b8) =\nPi\n(24)\n\u03b1i\nm\ni=1\nwhere the \u03b1i are (constant) multipole coefficients, the Pk are Legendre polynomials\n(of a moderately complicated argument):\n\u0013\n\u0012\n(r \u2212 m) cos \u03b8\n(25)\nPk \u2261 Pk\nR\nand\n\u0014\u0012\nR\u2261\n\n1\u2212\n\n2m\nr\n\n\u0013\n\nr2 + m2 cos2 \u03b8\n\n\u00151/2\n.\n\n(26)\n\nAt first glance there might appear to be problems with an ill-defined R for certain\nvalues of \u03b8 if r < 2m. However, this apparent problem is just an artifact of how we\nhave written the solution. In each case, multiplying the (R/m) term by the Legendre\npolynomial will both remove the R from denominators\nand leave only R2 terms in the\n\u0001 2\n2\n2\nnumerator \u2013 thus it won't matter if 1 \u2212 2m\nr\n+\nm\ncos\n\u03b8 is negative or vanishing.\nr\nThough the distorting potential U obeys linear equations and so different solutions\nmay be superposed, things are more complicated for V . Given a choice of U , the\nremaining Einstein equations determine V . However those equations are not linear in\nU ; thus the possible V do not superpose (again see the discussions of [16, 18, 19]).\nThe corresponding V are\n\u0013 \u0012 \u0013i+j\n\u0012\n\u221e X\n\u221e\nX\nR\nij\nV (r, \u03b8) =\n\u03b1i \u03b1j\n(Pi Pj \u2212 Pi\u22121 Pj\u22121 )\n(27)\ni\n+\nj\nm\ni=1 j=1\n\u2212\n\n\u221e\ni\u22121\ni \u0012 R \u0013j\n1 X Xh\n\u03b1i\n(\u22121)i+j (r \u2212 m (1 \u2212 cos \u03b8)) + r \u2212 m (1 + cos \u03b8)\nPj .\nm i=1\nm\nj=0\n\nThat said, as we shall shortly see, we will not actually need to use this form for V ; for\nour purposes a knowledge of U will be sufficient.\nOur interest is in the spacetime in the vicinity of the horizon so we now\nconsider the apparent singularity at r = 2m. Given the similarity between (23) and\nSchwarzschild, it will come as no surprise that it is just a coordinate singularity.

Note that this is not a unique transformation \u2013 for each value of\nro there is a different transformation and so a different v coordinate. In particular\nthese give rise to different v = constant foliations of r = 2m. That said, each of these\ntransformations eliminates the apparent singularity in the dr2 coefficient.\nThe only potential remaining singularities (apart from r = 0) are conical.

In particular they completely eliminate any need to work with the rather\nformidable (27).\n3.2. Do they contain black holes?\nFor U = V = 0 these solutions reduce to Schwarzschild and so certainly contain a black\nhole, while in the next section we will demonstrate that they always contain an isolated\nhorizon at r = 2m. However, we have already noted that isolated horizons are not by\nthemselves sufficient to imply the existence of black holes. Thus before continuing it\nis worth spending a bit of time confirming that these solutions are indeed black holes.\nTo begin, there are certainly difficulties if we require the classical causal definition\nof a black hole. These spacetimes are not asymptotically flat: for non-trivial choices of\nthe distortion coefficients \u03b1i , U diverges as r \u2192 \u221e. The distortion at the horizon may\nintuitively be viewed as reflecting the distortion \"at infinity\" and for such a distorted\n\n\fTrapped and marginally trapped surfaces in Weyl-distorted Schwarzschild solutions 10\ninfinity, the causal definition cannot be applied. Via a second interpretation of these\nsolutions we can (partially) rescue the causal definition. In this view the metric (23) is\nunderstood to only describe the geometry in some neighbourhood of r = 2m. However,\nat a global level, one assumes that farther out there is a matter distribution causing\nthe distortion and beyond that distribution the spacetime is asymptotically flat (see,\nfor example, the discussion in [16]). It is generally assumed that standard spacetime\nsurgery techniques could be used to construct such a spacetime. In that case there\nwould be an event horizon at r = 2m. There is some question as to whether physically\nreasonable matter could generate arbitrary distortions. For example, for general Weyl\nsolutions uo can take any value. However if one regards the distortion as being caused\nby external matter fields the strong energy condition requires that u0 \u2264 0 [16].\nLuckily we have good reason to interpret these solutions as black holes even\nwithout the use of spacetime surgery to insert matter. First the singularity at r = 0 is\nreal. Like the rest of the spacetime it is distorted, but it is certainly still there. This\ncan be seen by checking the Kretschman scalar, however as the resulting expression is\nnot particularly concise, it is probably easier to just read the extensive discussion in\n[19].\nSecond, these solutions contain fully trapped surfaces. It is well beyond the scope\nof this paper to identify the full extent of the prison. However it is straightforward to\nsee that, close to the singularity, trapped surfaces exist. In this regime (away from the\nhorizon) it is most convenient to return to the original metric (23). Then for surfaces\nof constant t and r, a future-pointing unit normal timelike vector is:\nr\n\u0014 \u0015a\n2m\n\u2202\na\nU \u2212V\n\u22121\n(38)\n\u00fb = \u2212e\nr\n\u2202r\nwhile the orthogonal outward-pointing unit normal spacelike vector is:\n\u0014 \u0015a\ne\u2212U\n\u2202\nr\u0302a = \u2212 q\n.\n\u2202t\n2m\n\u2212\n1\nr\n\n(39)\n\nA straightforward calculation shows:\n\u03b8(\u00fb)\n\neU \u2212V\n= q\u0303 \u2207a \u00fbb = \u2212\nr\nab\n\nr\n\n\u0012\n\u0013\n2m\n\u2202V\n\u2202U\n\u22121 2+r\n\u2212 2r\nr\n\u2202r\n\u2202r\n\n\u03b8(r\u0302) = q\u0303 ab \u2207a r\u0302b = 0 ,\n\n(40)\n(41)\n\nand so for ` = \u00fb + r\u0302 and and n = (\u00fb \u2212 r\u0302)/2 we have\n\u03b8(`) = 2\u03b8(n) = \u03b8(\u00fb) .\n\n(42)\n\nThe \u03b8(r\u0302) curvature vanishes because the surfaces of constant t are extrinsically flat\n(just as they are outside the horizon).\nNow, for general U and V and r < 2m, \u03b8(`) and \u03b8(n) do not have constant sign and\nare negative in some places but positive in others. This is most easily seen by direct\ncalculation; for example with a pure quadrupolar distortion with large \u03b12 . However\nclose to the singularity both \u03b8(`) and \u03b8(n) become negative. U and V are everywhere\nwell-defined and in particular neither they nor their derivatives diverge to infinity.\nThen as r \u2192 0:\n\u221a\n2 2m U \u2212V\n.\n(43)\n\u03b8(`) = 2\u03b8(n) \u2192 \u2212 3/2 e\nr\n\n\fTrapped and marginally trapped surfaces in Weyl-distorted Schwarzschild solutions 11\nThus, no matter how large the distortion, if we get close enough to r = 0 both\nexpansions become negative.\nWe will learn more about near-horizon trapped surfaces in the next two sections\nas we study the isolated horizon.\n4. The isolated horizon and its properties\nGiven the similarity in structure between the Schwarzschild metric and (23) one might\nexpect an isolated horizon to exist at r = 2m. This is indeed the case. Rather than\nchecking the definition directly, in this case it is easier to show that r = 2m is a Killing\nhorizon and then recall that all Killing horizons are automatically isolated horizons\nas well. From (30): 1) \u03be = \u2202/\u2202v is a global Killing vector field, 2) r = 2m is a null\nsurface and 3) \u03be is tangent to r = 2m. Then by the discussion surrounding (15), it is\nalso an isolated horizon and it is not surprising that the induced metric (32) on slices\nof the horizon is independent of the choice of foliation.\nFor ` = \u03be the surface gravity is\n1 2u0\ne\n> 0.\n(44)\n\u03ba(`) =\n4m\nThus if we find a foliation of these horizons that satisfies \u03b8(n) < 0 it will also\nautomatically satisfy \u03b4n \u03b8(`) < 0. We will explicitly explore this equivalence in the\nfollowing subsections.\n4.1. An expression for \u03b8(n)\nWe begin by finding an equation for \u03b8(n) . Since our distortions are rotationally\nsymmetric, we restrict our attention to similarly rotationally symmetric foliations\nwith leaves defined by\n\u001b\n\u001a\n(45)\nS\u03bb = (v, 2m, \u03b8, \u03c6) v + 2AS(\u03b8) \u2212 f (2m, \u03b8) = \u03bb ,\nwhere \u03bb is the foliation label, S(\u03b8) is the function defining the foliation and A =\n2me\u22122u0 . The 2A factor and the extra f (2m, \u03b8) are inserted to simplify future\ncalculations. Note however that for S(\u03b8) = 0, this transformation essentially reverses\nthe Eddington-Finkelstein transformation (28) at r = 2m.\nWe take the outward-pointing null normal to be the Killing vector ` = \u2202/\u2202v:\nthis is null vector field that will map leaves of the foliation (45) into each other.

Our investigation of\nhorizons for this entire class of spacetimes reduces to an study of whether or not there\nexist g(theta) that satisfy this inequality. That will be the subject of the next section.\nG[g] =\n\n\fTrapped and marginally trapped surfaces in Weyl-distorted Schwarzschild solutions 13\n5. Analysing the determining equation\n5.1. Examples\nTo build intuition, we begin with a couple of special cases. We adopt the standard\nfoliation (45) with S = 0 and examine the range of values of \u03b1 for which the resulting\nleaves of the horizon foliation can immediately be seen to be FOTS. For the pure\nquadrupole case with \u03b12 = \u03b1:\nG2 [0] = 1 \u2212 4\u03b1 cos2 \u03b8 \u2212 4\u03b12 sin2 \u03b8 cos2 \u03b8 .\n\n(55)\n\nIt is clear that this will not be everywhere positive and this is shown in Figure 1a. For\n\u22122 < \u03b1 < 1/4, G2 [0] is positive but for more extreme distortions it becomes partially\nnegative.\n\n(a) Quadrupole distortion\n\n(b) Dipole-octupole distortion\n\nFigure 1: Values of the distortion parameter for which \u03b8(n) < 0 and \u03b4n \u03b8(`) < 0 when\ng = 0. In the white areas they are negative while in the grey areas they are positive.\nNext consider the pure dipole-octupole case. Then by (34) \u03b11 = \u2212\u03b13 = \u03b1 for\nsome \u03b1 and we have:\nG13 [0] = 1 \u2212 2\u03b1 cos \u03b8(1 \u2212 3 cos2 \u03b8) \u2212 \u03b12 sin2 \u03b8(1 \u2212 3 cos2 \u03b8)2 .\n\n(56)\n\nAgain it is clear that this will not be everywhere positive and this is shown in Figure 1b.\nFor \u22121/4 < \u03b1 < 1/4, G13 [0] is everywhere positive but for more extreme distortions it\nalso takes negative values. In both cases increasing the distortion parameter not only\ndecreases the range of positive values of G[0] but also causes the negative regions to\nbecome increasingly negative.\nThe classification problem for these isolated horizons then amounts to deciding\nwhether or not there exists a function g(\u03b8) such that\nG[g] \u2212 G[0] =\n\ndg\n\u2212 g 2 + g cot \u03b8\nd\u03b8\n\n(57)\n\n\fTrapped and marginally trapped surfaces in Weyl-distorted Schwarzschild solutions 14\n\nFigure 2: The allowed ranges of distortions for g1 (dashed) and g2 (dotted). In\nboth cases the maximum allowed (positive) \u03b1 increases. The allowed range is that\nabove/below the lines.\n\ncan be made to balance off the negative areas arising from G[0] while still keeping the\npositive areas positive. This is a delicate balancing act.\nFor the quadrupole case, it is not too hard to (slightly) improve the upper bound\non \u03b1: large positive contributions can only be obtained from (57) by having g rapidly\ndecrease in the regions of interest. For example choosing\ng1 = \u03b1 sin 2\u03b8 or g2 = \u2212\u03b1 erf(\u03b8 \u2212 \u03c0/2) sin \u03b8 ,\n\n(58)\n\nwill increase the maximum distortion to about \u03b1 \u2248 0.45 as shown in Figure 2. At the\nsame time it decreases the allowed range of values for negative \u03b1. This is okay as we\nwould expect to have to pick different g for different values of \u03b1. Note however that\nthis increase of maximum allowed distortion has come at a cost: the region around\n\u03c0/2 is no longer positive for all \u03b1. In fact, increasing the factor of \u03b1 in g1 and g2 to,\nfor example, 2\u03b1 will actually result in a decrease in the maximum allowed distortion\nas the the curve begins to dip towards zero for \u03c0/2.\nA bit of experience trying to construct functions to increase the allowed range\nof distortions to larger (absolute) values of \u03b1 quickly leads one to suspect that these\nkinds of behaviours are generic: most choices of g do not improve the range and those\nthat do only increase it by fairly small amounts. In particular it seems very unlikely\nthat one could construct a g that would give G[g] > 0 for arbitrarily large values of \u03b1.\n5.2. Large \u03b1 quadrupole distortions\nWe now substantiate this suspicion with the following theorem for quadrupole\ndistortions which demonstrates that in general one cannot always foliate distorted\nisolated horizons so that \u03b8(n) < 0 everywhere. Similarly it is not always possible to\nchoose a scaling of the null vectors so that \u03b4n \u03b8(`) < 0 everywhere.\n\n\fTrapped and marginally trapped surfaces in Weyl-distorted Schwarzschild solutions 15\nTheorem 1 For |\u03b1| \u2265 5, there is no differentiable function g(\u03b8) satisfying\ndg\n> g 2 \u2212 g cot \u03b8 \u2212 1 + 4\u03b1 cos \u03b82 + 4\u03b12 sin2 \u03b8 cos2 \u03b8\nd\u03b8\nover the entire interval 0 \u2264 \u03b8 \u2264 \u03c0.\n\n(59)\n\nNote, that there is no suggestion that |\u03b1| = 5 is tight. As we are about to see, there are\nseveral crude assumptions in the proof and so this bound can certainly be improved\n(for example, it is easy to show that \u03b1 > 3 is sufficient for positive \u03b1). However,\nin this paper we are mostly concerned with the principle and so won't worry about\noptimizing the bounds.\nProof: The basic idea is consider the possible values of g(\u03c0/2). We show that if\ng(\u03c0/2) \u2265 0 then g necessarily diverges somewhere between \u03c0/2 and \u03c0. On the other\nhand if g(\u03c0/2) < 0 then g necessarily diverges between 0 and \u03c0/2. Thus, there is\nno continuous g that will everywhere satisfy (59). The root of the divergence is the\ndg/d\u03b8 > g 2 part of (59). The rest of the proof is just working to ensure that there are\nno strongly negative quantities around which might counter this divergence.\nNow, the details. We start by assuming that g(\u03c0/2) \u2265 0. Then, on completing\nthe square for g in (59), we obtain:\n\u0012\n\u00132\n1\ndg\n> g \u2212 cot \u03b8 + Z ,\n(60)\nd\u03b8\n2\nwhere\n1\ncot2 \u03b8 + 4\u03b1 cos2 \u03b8 + 4\u03b12 sin2 \u03b8 cos2 \u03b8 .\n(61)\n4\nFor purposes of the proof, we wish to work over a range of \u03b8 where we can guarantee\nthat: i) g(\u03b8) > go where go is a reasonably large positive constant and ii) g(\u03b8)\nis increasing. g(\u03c0/2) is not a suitable choice for go ; while g is non-negative by\nassumption, Z(\u03c0/2) = \u22121 < 0 and so the derivative of g could be negative. For\n|\u03b1| \u2265 5 we can only guarantee Z > 0 over the range 0.537\u03c0 < \u03b8 < 0.843\u03c0.\nTo get to a point where our conditions will be satisfied, we note that the first\nterm of (60) is always positive and so we can bound g at any point \u03b8 by:\nZ \u03b8\ng(\u03b8) \u2212 g(\u03c0/2) >\nZd\u03b8 .\n(62)\nZ = \u22121 \u2212\n\n\u03c0/2\n\nChoosing \u03b8 = 3\u03c0/4 we find\n\u0010\u03c0\u0011\n\n\u0011\n3\u03c0 + 4\n\u22121 \u03b1\u2212\n(63)\n8\n2\n16\nor since g(\u03c0/2) \u2265 0 and |\u03b1| \u2265 5, g(3\u03c0/4) > 6.12 (the lower bound is set by the\nnegative \u03b1). For our purpose 6.12 is sufficiently large and with 3\u03c0/4 in the range\n0.537\u03c0 < \u03b8 < 0.843\u03c0 we know that Z(3\u03c0/4) > 0 and so dg/\u03b8 is also positive at that\npoint.\nZ will remain positive until \u03b8 = 0.843\u03c0 so until that point we can drop it from\nthe right-hand side of (59) and still have:\n\u0012\n\u00132\ndg\n1\n> g \u2212 cot \u03b8 > g 2 ,\n(64)\nd\u03b8\n2\ng(3\u03c0/4) > g(\u03c0/2) +\n\n\u03b12 +\n\n\u0010\u03c0\n\n(since cot \u03b8 takes negative values over this range). Now the related differential equation\ndG\n= G2 ,\n(65)\nd\u03b8\n\n\fTrapped and marginally trapped surfaces in Weyl-distorted Schwarzschild solutions 16\nwith initial condition G(3\u03c0/4) = Go has solution\n1\nG(\u03b8) =\n(1/Go ) + (3\u03c0/4 \u2212 \u03b8)\n\n(66)\n\nand so diverges at 3\u03c0/4 + 1/Go . Then if we define \u03b3 by g = G + \u03b3, (64) implies\nd\u03b3\n> 2G\u03b3 + \u03b3 2 ,\n(67)\nd\u03b8\nand with all functions positive, \u03b3 must also diverge by 3\u03c0/4 + 1/Go . Taking Go = 6.12\n(the lower bound we found ealier) this implies that \u03b3 (and so g) will necessarily diverge\nbefore \u03b8 = 0.81\u03c0.\nThus, if |\u03b1| \u2265 5 then there is no function g satisfying both g(\u03c0/2) > 0 and (59)\nover the entire range. Setting \u03b8 = \u03c0 \u2212 \u03b8 and g\u0303 = \u2212g exactly the same reasoning\nwill demonstrate that similarly there is no solution g(\u03c0/2) < 0. If g cannot be either\npositive, negative, or zero at \u03c0/2 then it is clear that there is no g satisfying (59)\neverywhere. This establishes the desired result.\n6. Discussion\nWe have seen that for sufficiently distorted Schwarzschild solutions, the isolated\nhorizon can be foliated with neither marginally trapped nor outer trapping twosurfaces. Equivalently no slice of the horizon can be infinitesimally deformed to\nbecome fully trapped or even just outer trapped. By Hayward's terminology, the\ntrapping horizon is neither future nor outer (or for that matter past or inner!). At\nthe same time we have seen that these horizons bound a region that contains both a\nsingularity and trapped surfaces. Thus, there is good reason to continue to identify\nthe horizon as a black hole boundary even if the exact extent of the prison has not\nbeen determined.\nIn considering these examples, it should be kept in mind that quadrupole\ndistortions of \u03b1 = \u00b15 are very large. For \u03b1 = 5, R\u0303 ranges between \u22122 \u00d7 108 /m2\nand about 1 \u00d7 1010 /m2 while for \u03b1 = \u22125, it is flattened so that its range is from\n\u22121 \u00d7 10\u22125 /m2 to 3 \u00d7 10\u22125 /m2 . Though these are exact solutions their physical\nrelevance is, to say the least, unclear. For \u03b1 > 0 one is stuck with non-standard\ninfinities: it has been shown that inducing such distortions in standard spacetimes\nvia matter fields requires violations of the strong energy condition. For \u03b1 < 0, in\nprinciple it should be possible to induce the distortions with regular matter, however\none suspects that at best extreme stresses would be required and it is quite possible\nthat physical or geometric considerations might prevent the piecing together of the\ndesired solutions. We will consider the feasibility of these constructions in a future\npaper.\nSo, while these solutions appear to provide a counter-example to the idea that\nall static black hole solutions will be FOTHS or OTHs, their extreme nature needs to\nbe kept in mind. It is quite possible that despite the fact that no trapped surfaces\n\"hug\" the isolated horizon, it may still turn out that the horizon bounds the prison:\nit is just that the trapped surfaces approach it point-by-point rather than all at once.\nAlternatively it is conceivable, though we think less likely, that the solutions contain\none or more other isolated horizons (we only examined those of constant r). Then it\nis possible that the prison is bound by such a horizon and that horizon is a FOTH.\nIt would be interesting to determine the true extent of the prison and so properly\nunderstand this final point.\n\n\fTrapped and marginally trapped surfaces in Weyl-distorted Schwarzschild solutions 17\nAcknowledgements\nThe authors acknowledge Jos\u00e9 Senovilla in correcting some erroneous comments that\nwe made in the Introduction of the published version of this paper.
