We study in particular constraints from Bs \u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 and B \u2192 K \u2217 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 , emphasising\non the new LHCb results. We show that these rare transitions provide valuable information\nin the search for new physics and are complementary to the direct searches.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn addition to direct searches for new physics signals, indirect searches play an important and\ncomplementary role in the quest for physics beyond the Standard Model (SM). The most commonly used indirect constraints originate from flavour physics observables, cosmological data\nand dark matter relic density, electroweak precision tests and anomalous magnetic moment of\nthe muon. Precise experimental measurements and theoretical predictions have been achieved\nfor the B meson systems in the past decade and stringent constraints due to sizeable new physics\ncontributions to many observables can be obtained 1 . In the following, we present an overview of\nthe most constraining flavour physics observables for supersymmetry (SUSY), with an emphasis\non the recent LHCb results. The latest limit on BR(Bs \u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 ), being very close to the SM\nprediction, constrains strongly the large tan \u03b2 regime and the various angular observables from\nB \u2192 K \u2217 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 decay can provide complementary information in particular for intermediate\ntan \u03b2 values. We highlight here some of the implications for several SUSY scenarios and show\nthat these indirect constraints can be superior to those which are derived from direct searches\nfor SUSY particles in some regions of the parameter space.\n2\n2.1\n\nFlavour observables\nFramework\n\nThe effective Hamiltonian describing the b \u2192 s transitions has the following generic structure:\n\u0010 X\n\u0001\u0011\n4GF\nHeff = \u2212 \u221a Vtb Vts\u2217\nCi (\u03bc)Oi (\u03bc) + Ci0 (\u03bc)Oi0 (\u03bc) ,\n2\ni=1***10\n\n(1)\n\nwhere Oi (\u03bc) are the relevant operators and Ci (\u03bc) the corresponding Wilson coefficients evaluated\nat the scale \u03bc which encode short-distance physics. The primed operators are chirality flipped\ncompared to the non-primed operators, and they are highly suppressed in the SM. Contributions\n\n\ffrom physics beyond the SM to the observables can be described by the modification of Wilson\ncoefficients or by the addition of new operators. The most relevant operators in rare radiative,\nsemileptonic and leptonic B decays are:\nO1 = (s\u0304\u03b3\u03bc T a PL c)(c\u0304\u03b3 \u03bc T a PL b) ,\nX\n(q\u0304\u03b3 \u03bc q) ,\nO3 = (s\u0304\u03b3\u03bc PL b)\n\nO2 = (s\u0304\u03b3\u03bc PL c)(c\u0304\u03b3 \u03bc PL b) ,\nX\n(q\u0304\u03b3 \u03bc T a q) ,\nO4 = (s\u0304\u03b3\u03bc T a PL b)\nq\n\nq\n\nO5 = (s\u0304\u03b3\u03bc1 \u03b3\u03bc2 \u03b3\u03bc3 PL b)\n\nX\n\nO6 = (s\u0304\u03b3\u03bc1 \u03b3\u03bc2 \u03b3\u03bc3 T a PL b)\n\n\u03bc1 \u03bc2 \u03bc3\n\n(q\u0304\u03b3 \u03b3 \u03b3 q) ,\n\nX\n\n(q\u0304\u03b3 \u03bc1 \u03b3 \u03bc2 \u03b3 \u03bc3 T a q) ,\n\nq\n\nq\n\ne\nO7 =\nmb (s\u03c3 \u03bc\u03bd PR b)F\u03bc\u03bd ,\n(4\u03c0)2\ne2\n \u0304 \u03bc `) ,\nO9 =\n(s\u03b3 \u03bc PL b)(`\u03b3\n(4\u03c0)2\ne2\nQ1 =\n(s\u0304PR b)(` \u0304`) ,\n(4\u03c0)2\n\ng\nO8 =\nmb (s\u0304\u03c3 \u03bc\u03bd T a PR b)Ga\u03bc\u03bd ,\n(4\u03c0)2\ne2\n \u0304 \u03bc \u03b35 `) ,\nO10 =\n(s\u03b3 \u03bc PL b)(`\u03b3\n(4\u03c0)2\ne2\n \u0304 5 `) ,\nQ2 =\n(s\u0304PR b)(`\u03b3\n(4\u03c0)2\n\n(2)\n\nwhere Q1 and Q2 are the scalar and pseudo-scalar operators arising in new physics scenarios.\nThe Wilson coefficients Ci (\u03bc) are calculated at scale \u03bc \u223c O(MW ) by requiring matching\nbetween the effective and full theories. They can be expanded perturbatively:\n(0)\n\nCi (\u03bc) = Ci (\u03bc) +\n\n\u03b1s (\u03bc) (1)\nCi (\u03bc) + * * *\n4\u03c0\n\n(3)\n\nand are subsequently evolved to scale \u03bc \u223c O(mb ) at which they can be used to calculate the\nflavour observables, using the renormalisation group equations:\n\u03bc\n\nd\nCi (\u03bc) = Cj (\u03bc)\u03b3ji (\u03bc)\nd\u03bc\n\n(4)\n\ndriven by the anomalous dimension matrix \u03b3\u0302(\u03bc):\n\u03b3\u0302(\u03bc) =\n\n\u03b1s (\u03bc) (0) \u03b1s2 (\u03bc) (1)\n\u03b3\u0302 +\n\u03b3\u0302 + * * *\n4\u03c0\n(4\u03c0)2\n\n(5)\n\nwhich are known to high accuracy.

For each generated point we calculate the spectrum of SUSY particle masses and couplings using SOFTSUSY 14 or NMSSMTOOLS\n15 and compute flavour observables using SuperIso v3.3 3,16 .\nThe constraints are shown in Fig. 1 in the planes (Mt\u03031 , tan \u03b2) and (MH \u00b1 , tan \u03b2). The region\nmost probed by Bs \u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 is at large tan \u03b2 and small Mt\u03031 / MH \u00b1 as can be seen from the\n\n\fFigure 2: SUSY spread of the averaged BR(B \u2192 K \u2217 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 ) at low q 2 (top left), at high q 2 (top right), AF B (B \u2192\nK \u2217 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 ) at low q 2 (middle left), zero-crossing of AF B (B \u2192 K \u2217 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 ) (middle right), FL (B \u2192 K \u2217 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 ) at low\nq 2 (bottom left) and AI (B \u2192 K \u2217 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 ) at low q 2 (bottom right), as a function of the lightest stop mass, in the\nCMSSM with tan \u03b2=50 and A0 = 0.\n\nfigures. Since there are two additional degrees of freedom in NUHM as compared to CMSSM,\nit is easier for a model point to escape the limits and the constraints are therefore weaker in\nNUHM. In the CNMSSM, the Bs \u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 constraint is similar to the CMSSM case, but slightly\nstronger.\nNext we consider the constraints from B \u2192 K \u2217 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 observables. In order to study the\nmaximal effects we consider tan \u03b2=50 and investigate the SUSY spread as a function of the\nlightest stop mass. The results are displayed in Fig. 2 for the averaged differential branching\nratio at low and high q 2 , the forward-backward asymmetry AF B , the zero-crossing q02 of AF B ,\nthe longitudinal polarisation FL and the isospin asymmetry AI . The solid red lines correspond\nto the LHCb central value, while the dashed and dotted lines represent the 1 and 2\u03c3 bounds\n\n\fFigure 3: Constraints from flavour observables in CMSSM in the plane (m1/2 , m0 ) for tan \u03b2 = 50 and A0 = 0,\nin the left with the 2010 results for BR(Bs \u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 ), and in the right with the 2011 results. The black line\ncorresponds to the CMS exclusion limit with 1.1 fb\u22121 of data 18 and the red line to the CMS exclusion limit with\n4.4 fb\u22121 of data 19 . The colour legend is given below.\n\nFigure 4: Constraints from flavour observables in CMSSM in the plane (m1/2 , m0 ) for tan \u03b2 = 30 and A0 = 0.\n\nrespectively, including both theoretical and experimental errors (added in quadrature). As can\nbe seen from the figure, AF B is the most constraining observable and excludes Mt\u03031 . 800 GeV.\nOn the other hand, with the current experimental accuracy 17 , the isospin asymmetry does not\nprovide any information on the SUSY parameters.\nA comparison between different flavour observables in the plane (m1/2 , m0 ) is given in Fig. 3,\nwhere we can also see the limits from B \u2192 Xs \u03b3, B \u2192 \u03c4 \u03bd, Rl23 (K \u2192 \u03bc\u03bd\u03bc ), B \u2192 D\u03c4 \u03bd\u03c4 ,\nB \u2192 Xs \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 and Ds \u2192 \u03c4 \u03bd\u03c4 . In the left hand side, the combined CMS+LHCb limit from the\n2010 data (1.1 \u00d7 10\u22128 at 95% C.L.) is applied for BR(Bs \u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 ), while this limit is updated\nto the 2011 LHCb result (4.5 \u00d7 10\u22129 at 95% C.L.) in the right hand side. As can be seen, the\nrecent LHCb limit strongly constrains the CMSSM with large tan \u03b2. We also notice that, at large\ntan \u03b2, the flavour constraints and in particular Bs \u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 , are superior to those from direct\nsearches. By lowering the value of tan \u03b2, Bs \u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 significantly loses importance compared\nto direct searches as can be seen in Fig. 4. On the other hand, B \u2192 Xs \u03b3 and B \u2192 K \u2217 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212\nrelated observables and in particular the forward-backward asymmetry lose sensitivity in a less\ndrastic manner and they could play a complementary role in the intermediate tan \u03b2 regime.\nThe study in constrained MSSM scenarios is very illustrative and allows to pin down the\nmost important effects in a rather simple framework. However these scenarios are not representative of the full MSSM and by focussing only on the constrained scenarios one may miss some\n\n\fFigure 5: Distribution of pMSSM points after the Bs \u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 constraint projected on the MA (left) and\n(MA , tan \u03b2) plane (right) for all accepted pMSSM points (medium grey), points not excluded by the combination of\nthe 2010 LHCb and CMS analyses (dark grey) and the projection for the points compatible with the measurement\nof the SM expected branching fractions with a 20% total uncertainty (light grey) 21 .\n\nimportant features. Also the constrained scenarios are already very much squeezed, while this\nis not the case in more general scenarios. To go beyond the constrained scenarios, we consider\nthe phenomenological MSSM (pMSSM) 20 . This model is the most general CP and R\u2013parity\nconserving MSSM, assuming MFV at the weak scale and the absence of FCNCs at the tree level.\nIt contains 19 free parameters: 10 sfermion masses, 3 gaugino masses, 3 trilinear couplings and\n3 Higgs masses. To study the pMSSM, we perform flat scans over the parameters as described\nin 21,22 . The left panel of Fig. 5 shows the density of points in function of MA before and after\napplying the combined 2010 LHCb and CMS limit for Bs \u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 , as well as the projection for\nan SM\u2013like measurement with an overall 20% theoretical and experimental uncertainty. As can\nbe seen the density of the allowed pMSSM points is reduced by a factor of 3, in the case of an\nSM\u2013like measurement. The right panel shows the same distribution in the (MA , tan \u03b2) plane.\nThe region with large tan \u03b2 and small MA is the most affected one.\n4\n\nSuperIso program\n\nSuperIso 3,16 is a public C program dedicated mainly to the calculation of flavour physics observables. The calculations are done in various models, such as SM, 2HDM, MSSM and NMSSM\nwith minimal flavour violation. A broad set of flavour physics observables is implemented in\nSuperIso. This includes the branching ratio of B \u2192 Xs \u03b3, isospin asymmetry of B \u2192 K \u2217 \u03b3,\nbranching ratios of Bs \u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 , Bd \u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 , Bu \u2192 \u03c4 \u03bd\u03c4 , B \u2192 D\u03c4 \u03bd\u03c4 , K \u2192 \u03bc\u03bd\u03bc , D \u2192 \u03bc\u03bd\u03bc ,\nDs \u2192 \u03c4 \u03bd\u03c4 and Ds \u2192 \u03bc\u03bd\u03bc . In addition several observables related to b \u2192 s`+ `\u2212 transitions, such\nas branching ratios of B \u2192 Xs \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 and B \u2192 K \u2217 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 , the forward backward asymmetries,\nthe zero-crossings, polarisation fractions of K \u2217 , isospin asymmetries, transverse amplitudes, the\nCP averaged angular coefficients, etc..., have also been included.\nThe calculation of the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon is also implemented in the\nprogram. SuperIso uses a SUSY Les Houches Accord (SLHA) file 23 as input, which can be\neither generated automatically by the program via a call to a spectrum generator or provided\nby the user. The program is able to perform the calculations automatically for different SUSY\nbreaking scenarios. An extension of SuperIso including the relic density calculation, SuperIso\nRelic, is also available publicly 24 . Finally, in SuperIso we make use of the Flavour Les Houches\nAccord (FLHA) 25 , the newly developed standard for flavour related quantities.\n5\n\nConclusions\n\nIndirect constraints and in particular those from flavour physics are essential to restrict the new\n\n\fphysics parameters as we have seen here. The information obtained from these low energy observables combined with the collider data opens the door to a very rich phenomenology and\nwould help us to step forward toward a deeper understanding of the underlying physics. It is\nclear that with more precise measurements of flavour observables a large part of the supersymmetric parameter space could be disfavoured. In particular large tan \u03b2 region is strongly affected\nby Bs \u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 . Also, a measurement of BR(Bs \u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 ) lower than the Standard Model prediction would rule out a large variety of supersymmetric models. In addition, B \u2192 K \u2217 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212\nobservables play a complementary role specially for smaller tan \u03b2 values. With reduced theoretical and experimental errors, the exclusion bounds in Fig. 2 for example would squeeze leading to\nimportant consequences for SUSY parameters. The B \u2192 K \u2217 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 decay provides many other\nclean observables, not yet measured, which could also bring substantial additional information.\nAcknowledgements\nI would like to thank the organisers of the Moriond QCD 2012 for organising a great conference\nand for inviting me to give this talk.\nReferences\n1.
