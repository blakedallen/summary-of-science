The light elements Li, O, Na, Al, and Mg are known to show star to star variations in the globular clusters 47 Tuc and\nNGC 6752. Such variations are interpreted as due to processing in a previous generation of stars.\nAims. In this paper we investigate the abundances of the \u03b1-element sulphur, for which no previous measurements exist. In fact this\nelement has not been investigated in any Galactic globular cluster so far. The only globular cluster for which such measurements\nare available is Terzan 7, which belongs to the Sgr dSph.\nMethods. We use high resolution spectra of the S i Mult. 1, acquired with the UVES spectrograph at the 8.2m VLT-Kueyen\ntelescope, for turn-off and giant stars in the two globular clusters. The spectra are analysed making use of ATLAS static plane\nparallel model atmospheres and SYNTHE spectrum synthesis. We also compute 3D corrections from CO5 BOLD hydrodynamic\nmodels and apply corrections due to NLTE effects taken from the literature.\nResults. In the cluster NGC 6752 sulphur has been measured only in four subgiant stars. We find no significant star to star scatter\nand a mean h[S/Fe]i = +0.49 \u00b1 0.15, consistent with what observed in field stars of the same metallicity. In the cluster 47 Tuc we\nmeasured S in 4 turn-off and 5 subgiant stars with a mean h[S/Fe]i = +0.18 \u00b1 0.14. While this result is compatible with no star\nto star scatter we notice a statistically significant correlation of the sulphur abundance with the sodium abundance and a tentative\ncorrelation with the silicon abundance.\nConclusions. The sulphur \u2013 sodium correlation is not easily explained in terms of nucleosynthesis. An origin due to atomic\ndiffusion can be easily dismissed. The correlation cannot be easily dismissed either, in view of its statistical significance, until\nbetter data for a larger number of stars is available.\nKey words.

Introduction\nThere is substantial consensus that the so-called \u03b1-elements (O,\nNe, Mg, Si, S, Ar, Ca, and Ti) are synthesized essentially during hydrostatic and explosive burning phases in massive stars,\nand then released in the interstellar medium when such stars\nundergo type II Supernova (SN) explosion (Chieffi & Limongi\n2004). As such, \u03b1-elements provide crucial information to reconstruct the star formation history of stellar populations. O,\nMg, Si, Ca, and Ti are easily measured in stellar spectra and are\nthus the most frequent choice in stellar abundance studies. S on\nthe other hand is the natural choice when abundances are determined in the Interstellar Medium (ISM), Planetary Nebulae\n(PN), or extragalactic absorption systems (e.g. Damped Lyman\nAlpha systems, DLA) due to the ease of measuring it and its\nweak tendency to form dust. The extent to which stellar and\nSend offprint requests to: luca.sbordone@obspm.fr\n\u22c6\nBased on observations made with the ESO VLT-Kueyen telescope\nat the Paranal Observatory, Chile, in the course of the ESO-Large\nProgramme 165.L-0263\n\nISM / PN / DLA \u03b1-element enrichments are comparable is thus\ndependent on wether or not S is supposed to vary in lockstep\nwith the other \u03b1-elements.\nSulphur abundances in Milky Way (MW) stars have been\nobtained by several authors in the latest years (Nissen et al.\n2007; Caffau et al. 2007; Ryde 2006; Caffau et al. 2005b;\nKorn & Ryde 2005; Nissen et al. 2004; Ryde & Lambert 2004,\namong the most recent), but agreement on its behavior at low\nmetallicities is not reached yet. While some of the cited authors (e.g. Nissen et al. 2007) find S to follow the same trend\nas other \u03b1-elements ([S/Fe] showing a plateau at low metallicities), others point towards a steady growth of [S/Fe] with decreasing metallicity (Israelian & Rebolo 2001; Takada-Hidai\net al. 2002), or an increase in the scatter of [S/Fe] at low\n[Fe/H] (Caffau et al. 2005b). The cited debate can in fact be\nextended to the overall behavior of \u03b1-elements: while the standard view of [\u03b1/Fe] evolution with metallicity has for some\ntime now assumed the presence of a plateau below [Fe/H]\u223c\u2013\n1 (McWilliam 1997), observations as well as models suggest\nthe possibility of a continuing rise down to the lowest observed\n\n\f2\n\nSbordone et al.: Sulphur abundance in 47 Tuc and NGC 6752\n\nmetallicities, at least for Mg and O (first pointed out by Abia\n& Rebolo 1989, and more recently by Fran\u00e7ois et al. 2004, and\nGonz\u00e1lez Hern\u00e1ndez et al. 2008).\nIt is perhaps surprising that sulphur has been studied up\nto now almost exclusively in field stars. To our knowledge, the\nonly analysis of the S abundance in globular clusters is also the\nonly one for extragalactic stars (Caffau et al. 2005a, in Terzan 7,\none of the globular clusters of the Sagittarius dwarf Spheroidal\nGalaxy), where it behaves consistently with the rest of the \u03b1elements studied in the cluster, showing a low ratio with iron\ntypical of dwarf spheroidal systems (Tautvai\u0161ien\u0117 et al. 2004;\nSbordone et al. 2007). But on the other hand, S measurements\nare totally missing in MW Globular Clusters (GC). Globular\nClusters are somewhat peculiar environments regarding chemical enrichment, displaying some peculiar abundance anomalies\nand abundance correlations which have never been found elsewhere (for a review see Gratton et al. 2004). Among them the\nmost well known is likely the so-called O-Na anticorrelation,\nwhich appears to be widespread in MW globular cluster stars,\nand the Mg-Al anticorrelation. The nucleosynthetic processes\nresponsible for this are believed to be essentially understood,\nsince the chemical yields match well the ones derived from pcapture processes occurring in (or near) regions where H is being burned via the CNO cycle at sufficiently high temperatures\n(Gratton et al. 2004). On the other hand, such a condition is\nreached during different phases of stellar evolution, so that the\nactual processing site is still debated, as well as the mechanism\nthrough which the enriched gas is dispersed inside the cluster (Ventura et al. 2002; D'Antona et al. 2005; Decressin et\nal. 2007). There is nevertheless some consensus that the yields\nshould be released through slow moving ejecta, thus allowing\nthe GC gravitational potential to retain them more easily.\nWe present here the first sulphur abundances in the GC 47\nTuc and NGC 6752, both of which display evident Na-O and\nMg-Al abundance anticorrelations. They are also the only two\nclusters where a Na-Li anticorrelation has also been observed\n(Pasquini et al. 2005; Bonifacio et al. 2007).\n\n2. Observational Data\nThe spectra analysed in this paper have been acquired\nin the course of the ESO-Large Programme 165.L-0263.\nObservations, atmospheric parameters and abundances for elements other than S have been presented in Gratton et al. (2001),\nCarretta et al. (2004), and Bonifacio et al. (2007). We are\nhere concerned only with the dichroic #2, CD4 cross-disperser\nUVES@VLT (Dekker et al. 2000) spectra (setting centered at\n760 nm). For most observations the slit width was of 1\u2032\u2032 for a\nresolution of R\u223c43000. For the purpose of the sulphur measurement, only upper-red CCD data were used. Typical Signalto-Noise ratios (S/N) in the range were of about 15-20 per\nresolution element. Sulphur abundances were determined for\nnine stars observed in 47 Tuc, four of them being turn off (TO)\nstars, 5 subgiants (SG). Four stars, all subgiants, were considered in NGC 6752. Typical exposure times were 1h per star\nfor NGC 6752 SG stars, 2h per stars for 47 Tuc SG and 4h per\nstars (in both cases performing multiple 1h exposures) for 47\nTuc TO stars. An example of S i mult. 1 region is shown in fig.\n1.\n\nFig. 1. The (normalized) spectrum of 47 Tuc star # 1012\nwith superimposed a synthetic spectrum with T eff 5832 K,\nlog g 4.05, [Fe/H]=-0.5. The three lines of S i mult. 1 are\nlabeled, as well as the most prominent telluric absorptions\n(marked with \u2295 symbol).\n\n3. Analysis\nThe atmospheric parameters have been taken from Gratton et\nal. (2001) for the stars in NGC 6752 and from Carretta et al.\n(2004) and Bonifacio et al. (2007) (for star # 952) for the stars\nin 47 Tuc. 47 Tuc stars have a typical temperature of 5800\nK for the TO stars (log g=4.05) and of 5100 K for the subgiants (log g=3.84), the four NGC 6752 share the same atmosphere parameters, T eff =5347 K log g=3.54. For each star we\ncomputed a model atmosphere using version 9 of the ATLAS\ncode (Kurucz 1993b, 2005a) running under Linux (Sbordone\n2005; Sbordone et al. 2004). We used the updated Opacity\nDistribution Functions of Castelli & Kurucz (2003) with microturbulent velocity of 1 km s\u22121 and enhancement of \u03b1-elements.\nThe synthetic spectra were computed using the SYNTHE suite\n(Kurucz 1993b, 2005a) running under Linux (Sbordone 2005;\nSbordone et al. 2004).\nThe strongest lines of S i in the optical range are the lines\nof Mult. 1 (three lines around 923 nm) and of Mult.6 (two lines\nat 869 nm, see Table 1). We were unable to convincingly detect\nthe lines of Mult. 6 in any of our spectra, we therefore did not\neven search for Mult. 8 ( around 675 nm) which is weaker. Our\nanalysis is therefore based exclusively on the lines of Mult. 1.\nWe adopt the log g f values of the NIST database, which holds\nthe values of Wiese et al. (1969), which are experimental but\nof D quality, corresponding to a possible error up to 50 % (see\nTable 1 for the values). A thorough discussion of the available\nvalues for S i atomic data is avilable Caffau et al. (2005b).\nThe lines are in a spectral range contaminated by telluric\nabsorption, so that they are rarely all free from telluric contamination. Moreover, due to the low metallicity of the two clusters examined and to the low S/N ratio of the spectra, in most\ncases, only one of the S i lines of Mult. 1 is detectable. Due\nto the radial velocity of the clusters, the line which happens to\n\n\fSbordone et al.: Sulphur abundance in 47 Tuc and NGC 6752\n\nTable 1.

The\nmeasurement of the equivalent width (EW) of lines falling on\nthe wings of broad features is not easy, and produces a value\nwhich is usually lower, with respect to the true EW, by about\n5% (Caffau et al. 2005b). To determine the sulphur abundance\na line profile fitting procedure, taking into account the profile\nof the Paschen \u03b6 is to be preferred. The other two lines of Mult.\n1 are far enough from the Paschen \u03b6 not to be affected by it,\nso that for these lines the EW measurement would be a good\nchoice. To keep the analysis as homogeneous as possible we\nnevertheless decided to determine the sulphur abundance using line profile fitting for all the unblended features. Such fitting was performed by means of the code described in Caffau\net al. (2005b). In the fitting procedure, the line broadening\nwas kept fixed at the instrumental level (7 km/s). At this resolution, and with this S/N ratio, typical macroturbulent and/or\nrotational broadening would not affect the measurement significantly. We discarded the lines contaminated by telluric absorption because the telluric line subtraction from a spectrum\ndecreases the S/N that is already low. Also, we did not possess fast rotator spectra taken at the same time as the science\nexposures, which would have imposed to rescale the telluric\nfeatures, an operation which would add further uncertainty to\nthe measurement. Line-by-line S abundances are listed in Table\n1.\nThe S i lines of Mult. 1 are known to suffer from departures\nfrom LTE (Takeda et al. 2005). We therefore applied the NLTE\ncorrections, interpolated in table 2 of Takeda et al. (2005) to\ntake this effect into account. For our programme stars these are\nall negative and range between \u20130.1 and \u20130.3 dex.\n3.1. Estimation of analysis uncertainties\n\nUncertainty in the S abundance determination stems from both\nthe limited S/N ratio of the spectra and the systematics of the\nanalysis. To determine the effect of S/N we followed the same\n\n3\n\nmethod described in Caffau et al. (2005b), namely by performing Monte Carlo simulations. In that paper the error estimates\nare obtained for a sample of dwarf stars with [Fe/H]=\u20131.5. We\nhave performed additional Monte Carlo tests to assess the T eff\nsensitivity of the S lines in the SG stars (T eff being the only parameter showing a significant difference between TO and SG\nstars), and to ascertain that such uncertainties apply to the more\nmetal rich objects of 47 Tuc and came up with values which are\nessentially identical to the ones in Caffau et al. (2005b), which\nwe will then assume from now on.\nConcerning random errors, the result of a 1000-events simulations, for a parameter set compatible with the TO stars set,\nindicates an 1\u03c3 uncertainty (for a single line) of 0.12 dex for\nS/N=30, and 0.22 dex for S/N=15. The same values hold for\nthe SG stars. Given the typical S/N of our spectra, we will assume henceforth a typical uncertainty of 0.2 dex to be due to\nthe S/N.\nFor the TO sample, a change in log g of \u00b10.25 dex causes\na \u00b1 0.08 dex variation in A(S), \u00b1 100 K in temperature cause\na variation of \u22130.06 dex in A(S), while [Fe/H]\u00b10.2 dex induces a \u00b1 0.03 dex variation in A(S). Comparing with table 3 of\nCarretta et al. (2004) one notices that both T eff and log g variations act in opposite senses on [Fe/H] and on A(S). On the one\nhand, log g has a maximum stated error in Carretta et al. (2004)\nof 0.08 dex. Taking into account both the effect on metallicity\nand the one on A(S), this would lead to a variation of 0.03 dex\nin [S/Fe], negligible in the present scope.\nOn the other hand, Carretta et al. (2004) claim a maximum\nT eff error of \u00b1 90 K for TO stars and \u00b160 K for subgiants.\nShifting the whole temperature scale rigidly would not make\nor break the [S/Fe] spread we observe, but one could argue that\nthe Carretta et al. (2004) T eff scale might be excessively \"compressed\". By lowering the TO stars temperature and rising the\none of the subgiants by the maximum amount stated, one would\nreduce significantly the observed [S/Fe] spread. A 90 K lower\ntemperature for the TO stars would lower their [Fe/H] by 0.08\ndex. The effect on S would then be due both to the reduced T eff\nand to the decreased metallicity, the total effect being roughly\n\u2206A(S)=+0.04 dex. A similar calculation for the SG stars leads\nto \u2206A(S)=\u20130.03, which become \u2206[S/Fe]=+0.12 for the TO and\n\u20130.09 for the SG. This would reduce the [S/Fe] spread by 0.21\ndex, eliminating something less than half of it. On the other\nhand, such a change would lead [Fe/H] to differ between TO\nand SG stars. Currently, the two subgroups give precisely the\nsame metallicity (\u20130.67) with a dispersion of 0.02 dex among\nTO stars and 0.01 dex among SG stars. Applying the aforementioned opposite temperature differences would separate the\nTO and SG stars by 0.14 dex in metallicity, roughly five times\nthe quadratic sum of the two group uncertainties. We therefore suggest that any T eff bias is very likely to be a simple\nadditive shift to both TO and SG stars temperature. It is also\nworth noting that some imbalance (\u223c0.13 dex) exists between\nFe i and Fe ii abundances in the giants sample of Carretta et al.\n(2004). According to Carretta and collaborators' error budget,\nthis would be entirely solved by rigidly increasing the T eff in\nsubgiants by 100 K. Again, a rigid shift of the T eff scale would\nnot affect the spread in A(S) nor in [S/Fe], and would also break\nthe ionization equilibrium in the TO sample. Shifting the giant\nsample only would reduce the spread in sulphur abundance, but\n\n\f4\n\nSbordone et al.: Sulphur abundance in 47 Tuc and NGC 6752\n\nTable 2. 3D corrections for the S i 922.8 nm line, computed\nfor a set of stellar parameters compatible with the ones in our\nsample, for an EW of 12 pm.

Such a\ndiscrepancy would be worsened, should the temperature for the\nCarretta et al.

In Table 2 we present the resulting values.\nAssuming an equivalent width of 12 pm (typical for the observed stars), we tabulate the difference between the abundance\nneeded to reproduce the Equivalent Width (EW) in the 3D\nCO5 BOLD model (Freytag et al. 2002; Wedemeyer et al. 2004)\nand the one needed when using the comparison 1DLHD model\n(Caffau et al. 2007). As such, the 3D abundance is obtained by\nadding the correction to our 1D abundances. Table 2 reports\nthe model parameters as well. 3D corrections appear to be on\naverage 0.15 dex and positive, and appear highly homogeneous\nacross the explored parameter space. In particular, the differences in the corrections for TO and SG stars are small. They\nhave not been added to our measurements in the table and in\nthe figures, since comparison elements, in this and other studies do not have 3D corrections applied.\n\n4. Results\nOur results are summarised in Tables 3 and 4. For the reader's\ninformation we report there also some information on our pro-\n\nFig. 2.

(2001) and Carretta et\nal. (2004). The other abundances coming from these papers are\nalways 1D-LTE values, with the exception of Na, which had\nNLTE corrections applied according to Gratton et al. (1999).\nWe adopted a solar sulphur abundance of A(S)=7.21 in the\n[S/Fe] determination.\nIn NGC 6752, due to its low metallicity ([Fe/H]=\u22121.43),\nwe were only able to measure the sulphur abundance in the\nfour subgiant stars. In the fainter TO stars the S/N ratio was\ntoo low to detect the S i lines. From the four subgiants we derive < [S/Fe] >= +0.49 \u00b1 0.15. Our estimated error on the\nsulphur abundances is 0.2 dex, dominated by the noise in the\nobserved spectra. Thus the dispersion around the mean is fully\ncompatible with the errors. Moreover, [S/Fe] in NGC 6752 is\nfully compatible with the value found among field stars at this\nmetallicity (see Caffau et al. 2005b figure 10).\nFor the more metal-rich cluster, 47 Tuc, we have been able\nto measure at least one S i line for all the stars. In star 201075\nall the three lines of Mult. 1 were measurable. The [S/Fe] ratio\nvaries by almost 0.5 dex, with an average value of < [S/Fe] >=\n0.18 \u00b1 0.14. Given that the uncertainty in the S abundance in\neach star is estimated at 0.2 dex, the observed spread can in fact\nsimply reflect the measurement uncertainty. Moreover, as in the\ncase of NGC 6752, the mean [S/Fe] is totally compatible with\nthe value displayed by field stars of abundance comparable to\n47 Tuc (Caffau et al. 2005b).\n\n\fSbordone et al.: Sulphur abundance in 47 Tuc and NGC 6752\n\n5\n\nTable 4.

Stars in our sample belonging to the TO are identified\nby a larger open circle around them.\n\n47 Tuc is believed to display Na-O as well as Mg-Al abundance anti-correlations (Carretta et al. 2004). We thus decided to check for possible correlations between S and some\nof the cited elements. Sulphur has never been measured before in 47 Tuc but interesting insight can be gained regarding\nother elements by comparing Carretta et al. (2004) with the\nones obtained by Brown & Wallerstein (1992), Alves-Brito et\nal. (2005), and Koch & McWilliam (2008). In Fig. 2 [S/Fe] is\nplotted against [Na/Fe].

The typical size for the error is also indicated. Brown\n& Wallerstein (1992), Alves-Brito et al. (2005), and Koch &\nMcWilliam (2008) do not measure sulphur, but for reference\nwe add their values for [Na/Fe]: blue open squares for Koch &\nMcWilliam (2008) red open triangles for Brown & Wallerstein\n(1992), and green open stars for Alves-Brito et al. (2005). The\ncorrelation between Na and S abundance is clearly apparent in\nour data, and a Kendall \u03c4 rank correlation test in fact determines that the likelihood of [Na/Fe] and [S/Fe] to be correlated\nis 97.8%1 . Another interesting thing to notice is how all the\nstudies with the exception of Koch & McWilliam (2008) detect\na significant spread in the Na abundance.\nIn Fig. 3 we instead plot [S/Fe] versus [Si/Fe], all the symbols being the same as in Fig. 2. Again, there is an evident suggestion of a correlation, with the exception of star 433 which,\nwhile having a very high S abundance, presents a less extreme\n[Si/Fe]. Likelihood of the correlation from Kendall \u03c4 test is\nhere about 79%, but grows to 91% if star 433 is removed from\nthe sample. By removing star 433 from the [Na/Fe] vs [S/Fe]\ncorrelation test, one gets on the other hand a slight decrease\nof the correlation likelihood, down to 94%. It is worth noting\nhow star 433 has, according to Carretta et al. (2004), an unusually low [Fe/H] (0.14 dex below the average, way beyond the\nscatter of the Fe i abundances), and an unsatisfactory Fe i-Fe ii\nionization equilibrium (0.21 dex difference). Since no evidence\never emerged of 47 Tuc showing a spread in iron abundance,\none might regard these results as suggestive of some problem in\nthe analysis of star 433. If we tentatively assign the average Fe\nabundance ([Fe/H]=\u20130.66) to star 433, we obtain [S/Fe]=0.32,\nmore in line with the rest of the sample. In fact, star 433 has a\n[S/H] exceeding by just 0.14 dex the average value (h[S/H]i=\u2013\n0.48. [S/H]433 =\u20130.34).\nGiven the fact that most low-S stars (and low-Na stars)\nare TO stars, it is worth investigating whether diffusion in\nthe stellar atmosphere might be responsible for the observed\nabundance spread and its correlation with the Na abundance.\nOne would in this case expect TO stars to be most affected\n1\nThis is equivalent to say that the likelihood of the null hypothesis\nis 2.2 %. This is the likelihood that random errors applied to otherwise\nuncorrelated distributions might produce a level of correlation (\u03c4K )\nequal or superior to the observed one.\n\n\f6\n\nSbordone et al.: Sulphur abundance in 47 Tuc and NGC 6752\n\nby diffusion, while SG stars should not display them anymore\ndue to the deeper reach of their atmospheric convective zone.\nAccording to current models this is not a viable explanation of\nthe observed spreads. According to Korn et al. (2007) (fig. 1),\nby using a model with radiative acceleration and turbulent mixing, an old [Fe/H]=\u20132 TO star shows photospheric depletion of\nabout 0.25 dex in Na, 0.20 dex in S and 0.15 dex in Fe. The\neffect would be then 0.05 dex on [S/Fe] and 0.1 dex in [Na/Fe],\ntoo small to explain the observations.\n\n5. Discussion\nThe sulphur abundance in NGC 6752 agrees with the general\ntrend of \u03b1-elements in the field, and does not present any significant spread. In 47 Tuc the situation is less clear. The presence\nof a significant correlation between the S and Na abundance,\nand the hint of a S/Si correlation, suggest that the S abundance\nspread might indeed be real.\nRecently Koch & McWilliam (2008), in a thorough analysis of 47 Tuc, based on high quality spectra of bright giants,\nfound only a very limited spread in abundances, and were unable to confirm the presence of a significant spread in O, Na,\nAl and Mg. Such discrepancy with the results of Brown &\nWallerstein (1992), Carretta et al. (2004), Alves-Brito et al.\n(2005), and Bonifacio et al. (2007) has not found to date a satisfactory explanation. This is not the venue to reassess in detail\nthe work of the cited authors. Suffice to say that, applying an\nerror analysis similar to the one above sketched for sulphur,\nthe reality of the spreads in 47 Tuc as well as their correlation\nappear difficult to dismiss.\nIn Fig.4 we plot [Si/Fe] versus [Mg/Fe] for our stars (abundances are taken from Carretta et al. 2004), the sample of\nBrown & Wallerstein (1992) and the one of Koch & McWilliam\n(2008). Symbols are the same as in Fig. 2 and 3. The first thing\nthat can be noted here is that, with the exception of star 4822 ,\nour sample and the one of Koch & McWilliam (2008) present\nin fact the same spread in [Mg/Fe], but a very different one\nin [Si/Fe]. A word of caution should be here given regarding\nsilicon: it appears that Si shows a systematic discrepancy between TO and RGB in extremely metal poor stars (McWilliam\n1997; Cohen et al. 2004; Bonifacio et al. 2009). The reasons\nof the discrepancy are not known, NLTE effects being a possibility. The sense and amount of the discrepancy is compatible with the one seen here, so there exists the possibility that\nthe Si spread is not real. On the other hand, such an effect has\nnever been reported on stars as metal rich as the ones in 47 Tuc.\nAnother element for which the various authors do not reach a\nsatisfactory agreement is Ca. Average [Ca/Fe] is 0.34 in Koch\n& McWilliam (2008), 0.18 in Carretta et al. (2004), but solar\naccording to Brown & Wallerstein (1992) and Alves-Brito et\nal. (2005).\nAnother important aspect is of course constituted by the existence of significant correlations among the abundances. One\nmight consider as worrying the fact that all the TO stars of\nthe sample exhibit a low S abundance. On the other hand, star\n201075, which is a subgiant, and the one star where all the three\n2\nstar 482 is indeed suspect in a more general way, presenting the\nlargest Fe i - Fe ii imbalance of the whole Carretta et al. (2004) sample.\n\nFig. 4. [Si/Fe] plotted against [Mg/Fe] for our sample of 47\nTuc stars, plus Brown & Wallerstein (1992) (open red triangles), Alves-Brito et al. (2005) (green stars), and Koch &\nMcWilliam (2008) (open blue squares). Stars in our sample belonging to the TO are identified by a larger open circle around\nthem. A typical error for our sample is also displayed.\n\nlines of Mult. 1 were measured, shows low S as well. By examining Table 1 one might notice that the line at 922.8 nm gives\nthe highest abundance for star 201075. Since this line is the one\nmost frequently measured in the other stars, one might object\nthat, had it been the only one measured, the star would have\nassigned an higher abundance, compatible with the other subgiants. It has although to be noted that in NGC 6752 both this\nline and the one at 923.7 nm are systematically measured, and\nno sign exist of the latter giving a lower abundance. As detailed\nin sect. 3.1, the quoted T eff uncertainty would in principle be\nsufficient to remove the spread between TO and subgiant stars,\nif TO stars temperature was lowered and SGB stars temperature increased. On the other hand, this would make star 201075\neven more discrepant, and induce a Fe abundance spread between TO and SGB stars.\nFurthermore, a Monte Carlo simulation of 1000 events has\nbeen performed to check the likelihood that a significant correlation might emerge in the [S/Fe] vs. [Na/Fe] plot when the\nquoted errors are superimposed to a constant [S/Fe] for all the\nstars. Unsurprisingly, the result (\u223c2% likelihood) confirms the\nresult of the Kendall \u03c4 null-hypothesis probability. It is very\nunlikely that random errors might have produced the observed\nNa / S correlation.\nIn short, we believe that strong hints of a S abundance inhomogeneity in 47 Tuc do exist. It is nevertheless clear that the\ncurrently available data do not allow, due to a combination of\nlow statistics and significant uncertainties, to clarify the mat-\n\n\fSbordone et al.: Sulphur abundance in 47 Tuc and NGC 6752\n\nter. Further study would thus be in order, specifically targeting\na large number of stars from TO to RGB, and focusing on the\nelements that show significant spreads. Still, being unable to\njustify the current observations by means of either random or\nsystematic uncertainties, we feel compelled to look for a nucleosynthetic explanation. The Na-O anticorrelation is usually\nexplained by self pollution within the cluster by slow Na-rich\nwinds, either from AGB stars or from massive rotating stars. In\ngeneral, the stars of pristine cluster composition are expected\nto show low Na abundance, while a higher abundance is indication of \"polluted\" stars. Should Si and S abundance spreads be\nconfirmed, and should they both correlate with the Na spread\n(which is quite uncertain in the Si case), this would pose at least\ntwo problems.\nFirst, since Na-poor stars are Si-poor and S-poor as well,\nthe aforementioned model would indicate them as the \"unpolluted\" stars. 47 Tuc would then have formed with an unusual\nlow abundance of Si and S, at variance e.g. with Mg. Low\n[\u03b1/Fe] ratios are indeed observed in dwarf galaxies, but typically attributed to environmental effects (e.g. Lanfranchi &\nMatteucci 2007), and no evidence exist that they might privilege one explosive product (e.g. Si) over another (e.g. Mg).\nSecond, as just noted, both Si and S are believed to\nbe, almost exclusively, products of SN II explosive burnings.\nElementary models forbid globular clusters to be chemically\nenriched by internal SN explosions, since the total released energy is comparable to the cluster binding energy, and even one\nsingle SN II explosion should remove all the available gas from\nthe cluster potential well, and stop the star formation. This is\nthe reason why \"slow wind\" mechanisms have been invoked to\nproduce e.g. the Na pollution. At the same time, the lack of any\ndetectable spread in Fe abundance in 47 Tuc constitutes an additional problem, since one would expect some amount of Fe\nto be produced by the SN along with \u03b1-elements. On the other\nhand, such simplistic considerations provide likely too crude a\nmodel of the actual phenomenon, since they assume a spherically symmetrical, central explosion which energy is efficiently\ntransferred to the cluster gas. SN II explosion are in fact rarely\nspherically symmetrical (Wang & Wheeler 2008). Instead, they\ntend to release a large part of the energy along more or less\ncollimated jets which are not efficient in transferring the energy to the cluster ISM. Moreover, SN which explode in a nonspherically symmetrical way tend to produce larger fallback,\nwhich would in turn limit their Fe yield, thus eliminating the\n\"missing Fe spread\" problem. It is also suggestive that detailed\nmodels of stellar superclusters foresee a destructive interference among shock waves from different supernovae, within a\ngiven critical radius (W\u00fcnsch et al. 2008). As a result the inner part of the cluster would not only retain the yields, but also\nexperience an accelerated star formation. Whether this might\nbe the case on the smaller scale of normal GC (or whether\nsome/all the GC might form as superclusters) is anyway uncertain. Core collapse SN are a source of Na as well, and we see\nthat the Na abundance correlates well with the S abundance.\nThe applicability of the aforementioned model thus relies on\nthe (yet unexplored) possibility that high Na-yield and high \u03b1yield (or at least high S-yield) happen together.\nAn alternate way to produce S and Si would be through\nproton capture reactions. This is the same source invoked to\n\n7\n\nexplain the Na overabundance, which would be an obvious\nadvantage. On the other hand, S should this way be produced\nthrough the 31 P(p, \u03b3)32 S reaction. The phosphorus abundance\nin 47 Tuc is unknown, and in general, knowledge about P\nproduction channels and abundances in stars are sketchy at\nbest (see Caffau et al. 2007, and references therein). However,\nP in the Sun is roughly 3 dex less abundant than S. If the\nsame abundance ratio holds at lower metallicities, it would be\nimpossible to produce any significant amount of S at expenses\nof P. Phosphorus should then be formed at expenses of Si,\nwhich should then anticorrelate with S, which is not the case.\nThe next abundant enough seed is Mg (Mg \u2192 Al \u2192 Si \u2192 P\n\u2192 S), which indeed might show weak signs of anti-correlation\nwith Si (Fig. 4), although they are below any statistical significance. Given the very scarce knowledge about P abundances\nand production mechanisms, one might even suppose the\n\"original\" 47 Tuc P abundance to be heavily enhanced, thus\nproviding enough seeds to form \u223c0.2 dex of S. P abundance\nhas never been measured in 47 Tuc, but its abundance has\nbeen determined very recently in Horizontal Branch (HB) stars\nin NGC 6397 and NGC6752 (Hubrig et al. 2009), where it\nappears strongly enhanced, by more than 2 dex in NGC 6752,\nand almost 3 dex in NGC 6397. Chemical anomalies in HB\nstars are usually attributed to diffusion effects, but the current\nmodels (Michaud et al. 2008) do not seem to be account for\nmore than \u223c0.7 dex of P enhancement in the photospheres\nof HB stars of similar temperature. We thus think that the\npossibility of an enhancement of P abundance in globular\nclusters cannot be ruled out at the moment.\nAcknowledgements.
