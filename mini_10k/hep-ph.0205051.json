We give an overview over this quickly evolving research field with focus on testing new particle\nphysics.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nOver the last few years, several giant air showers have been detected confirming the arrival of cosmic\nrays (CRs) with energies up to a few hundred EeV (1 EeV \u2261 1018 eV) [1, 2, 3]. The existence of\nsuch ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) pose a serious challenge for conventional theories of CR\norigin based on acceleration of charged particles in powerful astrophysical objects. The question of\nthe origin of these UHECRs is, therefore, currently a subject of much intense debate and discussions\nas well as experimental efforts; see Ref. [4] for recent brief reviews, and Ref. [5] for a detailed review.\nThe problems encountered in trying to explain UHECRs in terms of \"bottom-up\" acceleration\nmechanisms have been well-documented in a number of studies; see, e.g., Refs. [6, 7, 8]. It is hard\nto accelerate protons and heavy nuclei up to such energies even in the most powerful astrophysical\nobjects such as radio galaxies and active galactic nuclei. Also, nucleons above \u2243 70 EeV lose energy\ndrastically due to photo-pion production on the cosmic microwave background (CMB) - the GreisenZatsepin-Kuzmin (GZK) effect [9] - which limits the distance to possible sources to less than \u2243\n100 Mpc [7]. Heavy nuclei are photodisintegrated in the CMB within a few Mpc [10]. There are no\nobvious astronomical sources within \u2243 100 Mpc of the Earth [11, 7].\nThe distance restriction imposed by the GZK effect can be circumvented if the problem of energetics\nis somehow solved separately and if one postulates new particles beyond the Standard Model; this\nwill be discussed in the third section.\nIn contrast, in the \"top-down\" scenarios, which will be discussed in the last section, the problem of\nenergetics is trivially solved. Here, the UHECR particles are the decay products of some supermassive\n\n1\n\n\f\"X\" particles of mass mX \u226b 1020 eV, and have energies all the way up to \u223c mX . Thus, no acceleration\nmechanism is needed. The massive X particles could be metastable relics of the early Universe with\nlifetimes of the order the current age of the Universe or could be released from topological defects that\nwere produced in the early Universe during symmetry-breaking phase transitions envisaged in Grand\nUnified Theories (GUTs). If the X particles themselves or their sources cluster similar to dark matter,\nthe dominant observable UHECR contribution would come from the Galactic Halo and absorption\nwould be negligible.\nThe main problem of non-astrophysical solutions of the UHECR problem in general is that they\nare highly model dependent. On the other hand, they allow to at least test new physics beyond the\nStandard Model of particle physics (such as Grand Unification and new interactions beyond the reach\nof terrestrial accelerators) as well as early Universe cosmology (such as topological defects and/or\nmassive particle production in inflation) at energies often inaccessible to accelerator experiments.\nThe physics and astrophysics of UHECRs are intimately linked with the emerging field of neutrino\nastronomy (for reviews see Refs. [12, 13]) as well as with the already established field of \u03b3\u2212ray\nastronomy (for reviews see, e.g., Ref. [14]). Indeed, all scenarios of UHECR origin, including the\ntop-down models, are severely constrained by neutrino and \u03b3\u2212ray observations and limits. In turn,\nthis linkage has important consequences for theoretical predictions of fluxes of extragalactic neutrinos\nabove a TeV or so whose detection is a major goal of next-generation neutrino telescopes: If these\nneutrinos are produced as secondaries of protons accelerated in astrophysical sources and if these\nprotons are not absorbed in the sources, but rather contribute to the UHECR flux observed, then\nthe energy content in the neutrino flux can not be higher than the one in UHECRs, leading to the\nso called Waxman Bahcall bound for sources with soft acceleration spectra [15, 17]. If one of these\nassumptions does not apply, such as for acceleration sources with injection spectra harder than E \u22122\nand/or opaque to nucleons, or in the top-down scenarios where X particle decays produce much fewer\nnucleons than \u03b3\u2212rays and neutrinos, the Waxman Bahcall bound does not apply, but the neutrino\nflux is still constrained by the observed diffuse \u03b3\u2212ray flux in the GeV range.\n\n2 Propagation of Ultra-High Energy Radiation: Simulations\nBefore discussing specific scenarios for UHECR origin we give a short account of the numerical tools\nused to compute spectra of ultra-high energy cosmic and \u03b3\u2212rays, and neutrinos [18, 19, 20]. In\nthe following we assume a flat Universe with a Hubble constant of H = 70 km sec\u22121 Mpc\u22121 and a\ncosmological constant \u03a9\u039b = 0.7, as favored by current observations.\nThe relevant nucleon interactions implemented are pair production by protons (p\u03b3b \u2192 pe\u2212 e+ ),\nphotoproduction of single or multiple pions (N \u03b3b \u2192 N n\u03c0, n \u2265 1), and neutron decay.\n\u03b3-rays and electrons/positrons initiate electromagnetic (EM) cascades on low energy radiation\nfields such as the CMB. The high energy photons undergo electron-positron pair production (PP;\n\u03b3\u03b3b \u2192 e\u2212 e+ ), and at energies below \u223c 1014 eV they interact mainly with the universal infrared and\noptical (IR/O) backgrounds, while above \u223c 100 EeV they interact mainly with the universal radio\nbackground (URB). In the Klein-Nishina regime, where the CM energy is large compared to the\nelectron mass, one of the outgoing particles usually carries most of the initial energy. This \"leading\"\nelectron (positron) in turn can transfer almost all of its energy to a background photon via inverse\nCompton scattering (ICS; e\u03b3b \u2192 e\u2032 \u03b3). EM cascades are driven by this cycle of PP and ICS. The energy\ndegradation of the \"leading\" particle in this cycle is slow, whereas the total number of particles grows\nexponentially with time. All EM interactions that influence the \u03b3-ray spectrum in the energy range\n\n2\n\n\f108 eV < E < 1025 eV, namely PP, ICS, triplet pair production (TPP; e\u03b3b \u2192 ee\u2212 e+ ), and double\npair production (DPP, \u03b3\u03b3b \u2192 e\u2212 e+ e\u2212 e+ ), as well as synchrotron losses of electrons in the large scale\nextragalactic magnetic field (EGMF), are included.\nSimilarly to photons, UHE neutrinos give rise to neutrino cascades in the primordial neutrino\nbackground via exchange of W and Z bosons [21]. Besides the secondary neutrinos which drive the\nneutrino cascade, the W and Z decay products include charged leptons and quarks which in turn\nfeed into the EM and hadronic channels. Neutrino interactions become especially significant if the\nrelic neutrinos have masses m\u03bd in the eV range and thus constitute hot dark matter, because the Z\nboson resonance then occurs at an UHE neutrino energy Eres = 4 \u00d7 1021 (eV/m\u03bd ) eV. In fact, the\ndecay products of this \"Z-burst\" have been proposed as a significant source of UHECRs [22]. The big\ndrawback of this scenario is the need of enormous primary neutrino fluxes that cannot be produced by\nknown astrophysical acceleration sources [19], and thus most likely requires a more exotic top-down\ntype source such as X particles exclusively decaying into neutrinos [23]. Even this possibility appears\nclose to being ruled out due to a tendency to overproduce the diffuse GeV \u03b3\u2212ray flux observed by\nEGRET [24, 20]\nThe two major uncertainties in the particle transport are the intensity and spectrum of the URB\nfor which there exist no direct measurements in the relevant MHz regime [25, 26], and the average\nvalue of the EGMF. Simulations have been performed for different assumptions on these. A strong\nURB tends to suppress the UHE \u03b3-ray flux by direct absorption whereas a strong EGMF blocks EM\ncascading (which otherwise develops efficiently especially in a low URB) by synchrotron cooling of the\nelectrons. For the IR/O background we used the most recent data [27].\nIn top-down scenarios, the particle injection spectrum is generally dominated by the \"primary\"\n\u03b3-rays and neutrinos over nucleons. These primary \u03b3-rays and neutrinos are produced by the decay\nof the primary pions resulting from the hadronization of quarks that come from the decay of the X\nparticles. In contrast, in acceleration scenarios the primaries are accelerated protons or nuclei, and\n\u03b3-rays, electrons, and neutrinos are produced as secondaries from decaying pions that are in turn\nproduced by the interactions of nucleons with the CMB.\n\n3\n\nNew Primary Particles and Interactions\n\nA possible way around the problem of missing counterparts within acceleration scenarios is to propose\nprimary particles whose range is not limited by interactions with the CMB. Within the Standard\nModel the only candidate is the neutrino, whereas in extensions of the Standard Model one could\nthink of new neutrals such as axions or stable supersymmetric elementary particles. Such options are\nmostly ruled out by the tension between enforcing small EM coupling and large hadronic coupling to\nensure normal air showers [28]. Also suggested have been new neutral hadronic bound states of light\ngluinos with quarks and gluons, so-called R-hadrons that are heavier than nucleons, and therefore\nhave a higher GZK threshold [29]. Since this too seems to be disfavored by accelerator constraints [30]\nwe will here focus on neutrinos.\nIn both the neutrino and new neutral stable particle scenario the particle propagating over extragalactic distances would have to be produced as a secondary in interactions of a primary proton that\nis accelerated in a powerful AGN which can, in contrast to the case of extensive air showers (EAS)\ninduced by nucleons, nuclei, or \u03b3\u2212rays, be located at high redshift. Consequently, these scenarios\npredict a correlation between primary arrival directions and high redshift sources. In fact, possible evidence for a correlation of UHECR arrival directions with compact radio quasars and BL-Lac objects,\nsome of them possibly too far away to be consistent with the GZK effect, was recently reported [31].\nOnly a few more events could confirm or rule out the correlation hypothesis. Note, however, that\n\n3\n\n\fthese scenarios require the primary proton to be accelerated up to at least 1021 eV, demanding a very\npowerful astrophysical accelerator.\n\n3.1\n\nNew Neutrino Interactions\n\nNeutrino primaries have the advantage of being well established particles. However, within the\nStandard Model their interaction cross section with nucleons, whose charged current part can be\nparametrized by [32]\nSM\n\u03c3\u03bdN\n(E) \u2243 2.36 \u00d7 10\u221232 (E/1019 eV)0.363 cm2 ,\n(1)\n21\nfor 1016 eV <\n\u223c E <\n\u223c 10 eV, falls short by about five orders of magnitude to produce ordinary air\nshowers. However, it has been suggested that the neutrino-nucleon cross section, \u03c3\u03bdN , can be enhanced\nby new physics beyond the electroweak scale in the center of mass (CM) frame, or above about a PeV\nin the nucleon rest frame. Neutrino induced air showers may therefore rather directly probe new\nphysics beyond the electroweak scale.\nOne possibility consists of a large increase in the number of degrees of freedom above the electroweak scale [33]. A specific implementation of this idea is given in theories with n additional large\ncompact dimensions and a quantum gravity scale M4+n \u223c TeV that has recently received much attention in the literature [34] because it provides an alternative solution (i.e., without supersymmetry)\nto the hierarchy problem in grand unifications of gauge interactions. It turns out that the largest\ncontribution to the neutrino-nucleon cross section is provided by the production of microscopic black\nholes centered on the brane representing our world, but extending into the extra dimensions. The\ncross sections can be larger than the Standard model one by up to a factor 100 [35]. This is not\nsufficient to explain the observed UHECR events [36].\nHowever, the UHECR data can be used to put constraints on cross sections satisfying \u03c3\u03bdN (E >\n\u223c\n19\n\u221227 cm2 . Particles with such cross sections would give rise to horizontal air showers\n10 eV) <\n\u223c 10\nwhich have not yet been observed. Resulting upper limits on their fluxes assuming the Standard\nModel cross section Eq. (1) are shown in Fig. 1. Comparison with the \"cosmogenic\" neutrino flux\nproduced by UHECRs interacting with the CMB then results in upper limits on the cross section which\nare about a factor 1000 larger than Eq. (1) in the energy range between \u2243 1017 eV and \u2243 1019 eV [42].\nThe projected sensitivity of future experiments shown in Fig. 2 below indicate that these limits could\nbe lowered down to the Standard Model one [43]. In case of a detection of penetrating events the\ndegeneracy of the cross section with the unknown flux could be broken by comparing horizontal air\nshowers with Earth skimming events [44].\n\n4\n\nTop-Down Scenarios\n\nAs mentioned in the introduction, all top-down scenarios involve the decay of X particles of mass\nclose to the GUT scale which can basically be produced in two ways: If they are very short lived, as\nusually expected in many GUTs, they have to be produced continuously. The only way this can be\nachieved is by emission from topological defects left over from cosmological phase transitions that may\nhave occurred in the early Universe at temperatures close to the GUT scale, possibly during reheating\nafter inflation. Topological defects necessarily occur between regions that are causally disconnected,\nsuch that the orientation of the order parameter associated with the phase transition, can not be\ncommunicated between these regions and consequently will adopt different values. Examples are\ncosmic strings, magnetic monopoles, and domain walls. The defect density is consequently given by\nthe particle horizon in the early Universe. The defects are topologically stable, but time dependent\nmotion leads to the emission of particles with a mass comparable to the temperature at which the\n\n4\n\n\fphase transition took place. The associated phase transition can also occur during reheating after\ninflation.\nAlternatively, instead of being released from topological defects, X particles may have been produced directly in the early Universe and, due to some unknown symmetries, have a very long lifetime\ncomparable to the age of the Universe. In contrast to Weakly-Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPS)\nbelow a few hundred TeV which are the usual dark matter candidates motivated by, for example,\nsupersymmetry and can be produced by thermal freeze out, such superheavy X particles have to be\nproduced non-thermally (see Ref. [45] for a review). In all these cases, such particles, also called \"WIMPZILLAs\", would contribute to the dark matter and their decays could still contribute to UHECR\nfluxes today, with an anisotropy pattern that reflects the dark matter distribution in the halo of our\nGalaxy.\nIt is interesting to note that one of the prime motivations of the inflationary paradigm was to\ndilute excessive production of \"dangerous relics\" such as topological defects and superheavy stable\nparticles. However, such objects can be produced right after inflation during reheating in cosmologically interesting abundances, and with a mass scale roughly given by the inflationary scale which in\nturn is fixed by the CMB anisotropies to \u223c 1013 GeV [45]. The reader will realize that this mass scale\nis somewhat above the highest energies observed in CRs, which implies that the decay products of\nthese primordial relics could well have something to do with UHECRs which in turn can probe such\nscenarios!\nFor dimensional reasons the spatially averaged X particle injection rate can only depend on the\nmass scale mX and on cosmic time t in the combination\n\u1e45X (t) = \u03bampX t\u22124+p ,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere \u03ba and p are dimensionless constants whose value depend on the specific top-down scenario [46],\nFor example, the case p = 1 is representative of scenarios involving release of X particles from topological defects, such as ordinary cosmic strings [47], necklaces [48] and magnetic monopoles [49]. This\ncan be easily seen as follows: The energy density \u03c1s in a network of defects has to scale roughly\nas the critical density, \u03c1s \u221d \u03c1crit \u221d t\u22122 , where t is cosmic time, otherwise the defects would either\nstart to overclose the Universe, or end up having a negligible contribution to the total energy density. In order to maintain this scaling, the defect network has to release energy with a rate given\nby \u03c1\u0307s = \u2212a\u03c1s /t \u221d t\u22123 , where a = 1 in the radiation dominated aera, and a = 2/3 during matter\ndomination. If most of this energy goes into emission of X particles, then typically \u03ba \u223c O(1). In\nthe numerical simulations presented below, it was assumed that the X particles are nonrelativistic at\ndecay.\nThe X particles could be gauge bosons, Higgs bosons, superheavy fermions, etc. depending on\nthe specific GUT. They would have a mass mX comparable to the symmetry breaking scale and\nwould decay into leptons and/or quarks of roughly comparable energy. The quarks interact strongly\nand hadronize into nucleons (N s) and pions, the latter decaying in turn into \u03b3-rays, electrons, and\nneutrinos. Given the X particle production rate, dnX /dt, the effective injection spectrum of particle\nspecies a (a = \u03b3, N, e\u00b1 , \u03bd) via the hadronic channel can be written as (dnX /dt)(2/mX )(dNa /dx),\nwhere x \u2261 2E/mX , and dNa /dx is the relevant fragmentation function (FF).\nWe adopt the Local Parton Hadron Duality (LPHD) approximation [50] according to which the\ntotal hadronic FF, dNh /dx, is taken to be proportional to the spectrum of the partons (quarks/gluons)\nin the parton cascade (which is initiated by the quark through perturbative QCD processes) after\nevolving the parton cascade to a stage where the typical transverse momentum transfer in the QCD\ncascading processes has come down to \u223c R\u22121 \u223c few hundred MeV, where R is a typical hadron\nsize. The parton spectrum is obtained from solutions of the standard QCD evolution equations in\n\n5\n\n\fmodified leading logarithmic approximation (MLLA) which provides good fits to accelerator data at\nLEP energies [50]. Within the LPHD hypothesis, the pions and nucleons after hadronization have\nessentially the same spectrum. The LPHD does not, however, fix the relative abundance of pions and\nnucleons after hadronization. Motivated by accelerator data, we assume the nucleon content fN of the\nhadrons to be \u2243 10%, and the rest pions distributed equally among the three charge states. Recent\nwork suggests that the nucleon-to-pion ratio may be significantly higher in certain ranges of x values\nat the extremely high energies of interest here [51], but the situation is not completely settled yet.\n\n4.1\n\nPredicted Fluxes\n\nFig. 2 shows results for the time averaged nucleon, \u03b3\u2212ray, and neutrino fluxes in a typical TD scenario,\nalong with low energy \u03b3\u2212ray flux constraints and neutrino flux sensitivities of future experiments. The\nspectrum was optimally normalized to allow for an explanation of the observed UHECR events, assum19\ning their consistency with a nucleon or \u03b3\u2212ray primary. The flux below <\n\u223c 2\u00d710 eV is presumably due\nto conventional acceleration in astrophysical sources and was not fit. The PP process on the CMB depletes the photon flux above 100 TeV, and the same process on the IR/O background causes depletion\nof the photon flux in the range 100 GeV\u2013100 TeV, recycling the absorbed energies to energies below\n100 GeV through EM cascading. The predicted background is not very sensitive to the specific IR/O\nbackground model, however [52]. The scenario in Fig. 2 obviously obeys all current constraints within\nthe normalization ambiguities and is therefore quite viable. Note that the diffuse \u03b3\u2212ray background\nmeasured by EGRET [24] up to 10 GeV puts a strong constraint on these scenarios, especially if there\nis already a significant contribution to this background from conventional sources such as unresolved\n\u03b3\u2212ray blazars [53]. However, this constraint is much weaker for TDs or decaying long lived X particles\nwith a non-uniform clustered density [54]\nThe energy loss and absorption lengths for UHE nucleons and photons are short (<\n\u223c 100 Mpc).\nThus, their predicted UHE fluxes are independent of cosmological evolution. The \u03b3\u2212ray flux below\n\u2243 1011 eV, however, scales as the total X particle energy release integrated over all redshifts and\nincreases with decreasing p [55]. For mX = 2 \u00d7 1016 GeV, scenarios with p < 1 are therefore ruled out,\nwhereas constant comoving injection models (p = 2) are well within the limits.\nIt is clear from the above discussions that the predicted particle fluxes in the TD scenario are\ncurrently uncertain to a large extent due to particle physics uncertainties (e.g., mass and decay modes\nof the X particles, the quark fragmentation function, the nucleon fraction fN , and so on) as well\nas astrophysical uncertainties (e.g., strengths of the radio and infrared backgrounds, extragalactic\nmagnetic fields, etc.). More details on the dependence of the predicted UHE particle spectra and\ncomposition on these particle physics and astrophysical uncertainties are contained in Ref. [63].\nWe stress here that there are viable TD scenarios which predict nucleon fluxes that are comparable\nto or even higher than the \u03b3\u2212ray flux at all energies, even though \u03b3\u2212rays dominate at production.\nThis occurs, e.g., in the case of high URB and/or for a strong EGMF, and a nucleon fragmentation\nfraction of \u2243 10%. Some of these TD scenarios would therefore remain viable even if UHECR induced\nEAS should be proven inconsistent with photon primaries (see, e.g., Ref. [64]). This is in contrast to\nscenarios with decaying massive dark matter in the Galactic halo which, due to the lack of absorption,\npredict compositions directly given by the fragmentation function, i.e. domination by \u03b3\u2212rays.\nThe normalization procedure to the UHECR flux described above imposes the constraint Q0UHECR <\n\u223c\n\u221222\n10\neV cm\u22123 sec\u22121 within a factor of a few [65, 63, 66] for the total energy release rate Q0 from TDs\nat the current epoch. In most TD models, because of the unknown values of the parameters involved,\nit is currently not possible to calculate the exact value of Q0 from first principles, although it has been\nshown that the required values of Q0 (in order to explain the UHECR flux) mentioned above are quite\npossible for certain kinds of TDs. Some cosmic string simulations and the necklace scenario suggest\n\n6\n\n\fthat defects may lose most of their energy in the form of X particles and estimates of this rate have\nbeen given [67, 48]. If that is the case, the constraint on Q0UHECR translates via Eq. (2) into a limit on\n13\nthe symmetry breaking scale \u03b7 and hence on the mass mX of the X particle: \u03b7 \u223c mX <\n\u223c 10 GeV [68].\nIndependently of whether or not this scenario explains UHECR, the EGRET measurement of the\n\u221223 h(3p \u2212 1) eV cm\u22123 sec\u22121 ,\ndiffuse GeV \u03b3\u2212ray background leads to a similar bound, Q0EM <\n\u223c 2.2 \u00d7 10\nwhich leaves the bound on \u03b7 and mX practically unchanged. Furthermore, constraints from limits on\nCMB distortions and light element abundances from 4 He-photodisintegration are comparable to the\nbound from the directly observed diffuse GeV \u03b3-rays [55]. That these crude normalizations lead to\nvalues of \u03b7 in the right range suggests that defect models require less fine tuning than decay rates in\nscenarios of metastable massive dark matter.\nAs discussed above, in TD scenarios most of the energy is released in the form of EM particles\nand neutrinos. If the X particles decay into a quark and a lepton, the quark hadronizes mostly into\npions and the ratio of energy release into the neutrino versus EM channel is r \u2243 0.3. The energy\nfluence in neutrinos and \u03b3\u2212rays is thus comparable. However, whereas the photons are recycled down\nto the GeV range where their flux is constrained by the EGRET measurement, the neutrino flux is\npractically not changed during propagation and thus reflects the injection spectrum. Its predicted\nlevel is consistent with all existing upper limits (compare Fig. 2 with Fig. 1) but should be detectable\nby several experiments under construction or in the proposal stage (see Fig. 2). This would allow to\ndirectly see the quark fragmentation spectrum.\n\n5\n\nConclusions\n\nUltra-high energy cosmic rays have the potential to open a window to and act as probes of new\nparticle physics beyond the Standard Model as well as processes occuring in the early Universe at\nenergies close to the Grand Unification scale. Even if their origin will turn out to be attributable to\nastrophysical shock acceleration with no new physics involved, they will still be witnesses of one of\nthe most energetic processes in the Universe. The future appears promising and exciting due to the\nanticipated arrival of several large scale experiments.\n\nReferences\n[1] See, e.g., M. A. Lawrence, R. J. O. Reid, and A. A. Watson, J. Phys.

Also shown are existing upper limits on the diffuse\nneutrino fluxes from AMANDA [37] AGASA [38], the Fly's Eye [39] and RICE [40] experiments, and the\nlimit obtained with the Goldstone radio telescope (GLUE) [41].\n\n11\n\n\fj(E) E2 [eV cm-2 s-1 sr-1]\n\n106\n104\n\nMOUNT\nEGRET\n\n102\n\nTA\nOWL\nICECUBE\nAUGER\n\n1\n\n10-2\n108\n\n1010\n\n1012\n\n1014\n\n1016\nE [eV]\n\n1018\n\n1020\n\n1022\n\nFigure 2: (from work in Ref. [20]) Predictions for the differential fluxes of \u03b3\u2212rays (dotted line), nucleons\n(thin solid line), and neutrinos per flavor (thick solid line, assuming maximal mixing among all flavors)\nin a TD model characterized by p = 1, mX = 2 \u00d7 1014 GeV, and the decay mode X \u2192 q + q, assuming\nthe QCD fragmentation function in MLLA approximation [50], with a fraction of 10% nucleons. The\ncalculation used the code described in Ref. [18] and assumed the minimal URB version consistent with\nobservations [26] and an EGMF of 10\u221212 G. Cosmic ray data are as in Fig. 1 and the EGRET data on the\nleft margin represents the diffuse \u03b3\u2212ray flux between 30 MeV and 100 GeV [24]. Also shown are expected\nsensitivities of the Auger project currently in construction to electron/muon and tau-neutrinos [56], and\nthe planned projects telescope array [57], the water-based ANTARES [58], the ice-based ICECUBE [59],\nthe fluorescence/\u010cerenkov detector MOUNT [60], and the space based OWL [61] (we take the latter as\nrepresentative also for EUSO [62]).\n\n12\n\n\f"}
