The probability measure we consider must be shift\nergodic and invariant for the automaton.\n\u2217\n\nE-mail address: pierre.tisseur@ufabc.edu.br\n\n1\n\n\f1\n\nIntroduction\n\nA one-dimensional cellular automaton (CA) is a discrete mathematical idealization of a space-time physical system. The space, called configuration\nspace, is the set of doubly infinite sequences of elements of a finite set A.\nThe discrete time is represented by the action of a cellular automaton F on\nthis space. Since cellular automata are continuous, shift commuting dynamical systems and depend on a local rule, relations between the spacial (shift)\nand temporal (automaton) entropies seems natural. In [6] Shereshevsky establishes a first relation between the entropy of the shift and the entropy of\nthe cellular automaton using some discrete analog of Lyapunov exponents\nfor a CA ergodic measure. The product of the shift entropy by the lyapunov\nexponents give an upper bound of the CA. In [7] Tisseur define average Lyapunov exponents using a CA invariant and shift ergodic measure. Given an\ninfinite configuration, the two Lyapunov exponents (left and right) represent\nthe speed of the faster perturbations moving from the left to the right or\nfrom the right to the left coordinates. Remark that it is possible to define\nthese left and right exponents for each points or to take an average value of\nthese speeds.\nThe Average Lyapunov exponents give the rate of propagation of the\nfaster perturbations and do not take in account the amount of information the\nautomaton carry. This is the reason for which in many cases the inequality\nis not an equality. Nevertheless the average Lyapunov exponents (when they\nare equal to zero) are able to prove that the measurable entropy of the cellular\nautomaton is null for CA with equicontinuous points (see [7]) and for some\nparticular sensitive (without equicontinous point) CA (see [2]).\nHere, we propose to introduce the density flow M\u03bc (v) of the perturbations\nwith respect to a velocity v = (v + , v \u2212 ) where v + is the right to left speed\nand v \u2212 the right to left speed. This average flow depends on a shift-ergodic\nand CA invariant probability measure \u03bc. In section 3.2 (Theorem 2), we\nestablish that h\u03bc (F ) = h\u03bc (\u03c3) \u00d7 M\u03bc (v) \u00d7 (v + + v \u2212 ) where h\u03bc (F ) and h\u03bc (\u03c3)\nare respectively the entropy of the automaton F and the entropy of the shift\n\u03c3 and the speeds v + and v \u2212 are greater than the radius r of the (CA).\nMore generally, Theorem 2 states that h\u03bc (F ) \u2265 h\u03bc (\u03c3) \u00d7 M\u03bc (v) \u00d7 (v + +\nv \u2212 ). These relations can be compared with the inequality that appears in\n[7] : h\u03bc (F ) \u2264 h\u03bc (\u03c3) \u00d7 (I\u03bc+ + I\u03bc\u2212 ) where I\u03bc+ and I\u03bc\u2212 are the left and right\nAverage Lyapunov exponents. Remark that the condition v + , v \u2212 \u2265 r can\nbe substituted by a weaker one (see Theorem 2) in relation with \"maximum\n2\n\n\fLyapunov exponents\".\nOne of our motivations to define the density flow is to understand the dynamic of cellular automata with null measurable entropy. From [7], I\u03bc+ +I\u03bc\u2212 =\n0 and h\u03bc (F ) = 0, if there exist equicontinuous points in the topological support of the shift ergodic and F -invariant measure \u03bc. Having equicontinuous points is equivalent to say that exist some patterns of positive measure,\ncalled blocking words that stop the perturbations.In [2], Bressaud and Tisseur\nshow that there exists a sensitive cellular automaton (without equicontinuous\npoints) such that I\u03bc+ + I\u03bc\u2212 = 0 which implies that h\u03bc (F ) = 0. In section 3.3\nwe give an example of a cellular automaton F , such that the faster perturbations move at positive speed (I\u03bc+ + I\u03bc\u2212 = 1) but the density flow at speed\nv + , v \u2212 := 1 is equal to zero. In that case the density flow is equal to zero\nbecause the weight of the perturbation moving at a positive speed is equal\nto zero and Theorem 2 implies that h\u03bc (F ) = 0.\nFinally we show some relations between some subclasses of CA and the\ndensity of flow. We state that there always exists a positive velocity v such\nthat M\u03bc (v) = 1 when the cellular automaton F has the positive expansiveness\nproperty (\u03bc is a shift ergodic and F -invariant measure). In this case, all\nthe perturbations move with a speed at least equal to v. Furthemore, we\nprove that M\u03bc (v) = 0 for all linear or \"sublinear speed\" v if the cellular\nautomaton F has \u03bc-equicontinuous points, a measurable equivalent to the\nexistence of equicontinuous points introduced by Gilman in [3]. This class\nis the complementary class of the \u03bc-expansive class which is a measurable\nequivalent to the positive expansiveness one. We call sublinear speed v any\ncouple (v + , v \u2212 ) where v + and v \u2212 represent positive integer sequences (vn+ )\n+\n\u2212\nand (vn\u2212 ) that verify limn\u2192\u221e (vn+ + vn\u2212 ) = +\u221e and limn\u2192\u221e ( vnn + vnn ) = 0.\n\n2\n2.1\n\nPreliminary\nSymbolics systems and cellular automata\n\nLet A be a finite set or alphabet. Denote by A\u2217 the set of all concatenations\nof letters in A. These concatenations are called words. The length of a word\nu \u2208 A\u2217 is denoted by |u|. The set of bi-infinite sequences x = (xi )i\u2208Z is\ndenoted by AZ . A point x \u2208 AZ is called a configuration. For i \u2264 j in Z\nwe denote by x(i, j) the word xi . . . xj and by x(p, \u221e) the infinite sequence\n(vi )i\u2208N such that for all i \u2208 N one has vi = xp+i\u22121 . We endow AZ with the\n3\n\n\fproduct topology. The shift \u03c3: AZ \u2192 AZ is defined by : \u03c3(x) = (xi+1 )i\u2208Z .\nFor each integer t and each word u, we call cylinder the set [u]t = {x \u2208\nAZ : xt = u1 . . . ; xt+|u| = u|u| }. For this topology AZ is a compact metric\nspace. A metric compatible with this topology can be defined by the distance\nd(x, y) = 2\u2212i where i = min{|j| such that x(j) 6= y(j)}. The dynamical\nsystem (AZ , \u03c3) is called the full shift. A subshift X is a closed shift-invariant\nsubset X of AZ endowed with the shift \u03c3. It is possible to identify (X, \u03c3) with\nthe set X. If \u03b1 = {A1 , . . . , An } and \u03b2 = {B1 , . . . , Bm } are two partitions\ndenote by \u03b1 \u2228 \u03b2 the partition {Ai \u2229 Aj i = 1 . . . n, j = 1, . . . , m}. Consider a\nprobability measure \u03bc on the Borel sigma-algebra B of AZ . If \u03bc is \u03c3-invariant\nthen the topological support of \u03bc is a subshift denoted by S(\u03bc). The metric\nentropy h\u03bc (T ) of a transformation T is an isomorphism\ninvariant between\nP\ntwo \u03bc-preserving transformations. Put H\u03bc (\u03b1) = A\u2208\u03b1 \u03bc(A) log \u03bc(A). The\nn\u22121 \u2212i\nentropy of the partition \u03b1 is defined as h\u03bc (\u03b1) = limn\u2192\u221e 1/nH\u03bc (\u2228i=0\nT \u03b1)\nand the entropy of (X, T, \u03bc) as sup\u03b1 h\u03bc (\u03b1).\nA cellular automaton (CA) is a continuous self-map F on AZ commuting\nwith the shift. The Curtis-Hedlund-Lyndon theorem states that for every\ncellular automaton F there exist an integer r and a block map f from A2r+1\nto A such that: F (x)i = f (xi\u2212r , . . . , xi , . . . , xi+r ). The integer r is called the\nradius of the cellular automaton. If the block map of a cellular automaton is\nsuch that F (x)i = f (xi , . . . , . . . , xi+r ), the cellular automaton is called onesided and can be extended a map on a two-sided shift AZ or a map on a\none-sided shift AN . If X is a subshift of AZ and one has F (X) \u2282 X, the\nrestriction of F to X determines a dynamical system (X, F ); it is called a\ncellular automaton on X.\n\n2.2\n\nOther definitions and one inequality\n\nTopological and measurable properties:\nFor all x \u2208 AZ and \u01eb > 0 denote by D(x, \u01eb) be the set of all points y such\nthat for all i \u2208 N one has d(F i (x), F i (y)) < \u01eb and for all positive integer n,\nwrite Bn (x) = D(x, 2\u2212n ). For all x \u2208 AZ , the set Cn (x) represents the set of\nall points y such that y(\u2212n, n) = x(\u2212n, n).\nDefinition 1 Equicontinuity\n- A point x is called an equicontinuous point if for all positive integer n,\nthere exists another integer m \u2265 n such that Bn (x) \u2283 Cn (x).\n4\n\n\f- A point x is called a \u03bc-almost equicontinuous point if \u03bc(Bn (x)) > 0 for\nall integer n \u2265 r.\nFrom [3], and [8], if F is a CA of radius r, \u03bc is a shift ergodic measure and\nx a point which verifies \u03bc(Br (x)) > 0 then there exist a set of measure one\nof \u03bc-equicontinuous points. In this case we say that F is a \u03bc-equicontinuous\nCA.\nDefinition 2 Expansiveness\n-A Cellular automaton is positively expansive if there exists a positive\ninteger n such that for all x \u2208 AZ one has Bn (x) = {x}.\n-Let \u03bc be a shift ergodic measure.

Remark that the uniform measure \u03bc\nis shift and F -ergodic and that #p Tn (x) does not depends on x and p. Since\nduring the n first iterations of the automaton F , the coordinates between\np + r + 1 and p + rn in X1 and the coordinates between \u2212p and \u2212p \u2212 rn in\nX does not reach the central coordinates between \u2212p and p, we can write\nthat #Tn,p (x) = 2(r\u22121)n+2rn .

Let \u03bcs2 be the unique\nergodic invariant measure on (X2 , \u03c32 ) where \u03c32 is the shift on X2 . We call\n\u03bc1 , the uniform measure on X1 = {0, 1}Z and we denote by x = x1 \u00d7 x2\nany point in X = X1 \u00d7 X2 . Consider the cellular automaton F = Id1 \u00d7 \u03c32r\nwhere Id1 is the identity map on X1 , r any positive integer and denote by\n\u03bc the measure \u03bc1 \u00d7 \u03bcs2 defined on X. Using well known results, we have\nh\u03bcs2 (\u03c32 ) = 0, h\u03bc1 (Id1 ) = 0 and consequently h\u03bc (F ) = 0. From theorem 2,\nwe have M\u03bc (r) = 0. Clearly the Lyapunov exponents I\u03bc+ + I\u03bc\u2212 = I\u03bc+ = r,\nso in this case there exist perturbations moving at a positive speed but the\naverage flow is equal to 0.\nIf we modify slightly the last example and we replace the identity map on\nX1 by r iterations of the shift \u03c31 on X1 and the shift \u03c32r by the identity, we\nobtain a couple (cellular automaton F2 = \u03c31r \u00d7 Id2 , measure \u03bc) such that the\ninequality of Theorem 1 becomes an equality : h\u03bc (F2 ) = h\u03bc (\u03c3) \u00d7 (I\u03bc+ + I\u03bc\u2212 ) =\nr log(2) and in this case M\u03bc (r, 0) = 1 (the maximum value of M\u03bc (v)).\n\n16\n\n\f3.4\n\nThe density flow and some subclasses of cellular\nautomata\n\nClearly, in some cases like the shifts or more generaly bipermutative cellular\nautomata (see [4]), all the perturbations move at speed r which implies that\nM\u03bc (r) = 1 for all shift ergodic and F -invariant measure \u03bc. Sometimes, like\nin the last example M\u03bc (r) = 1 and almost all perturbation move at speed r.\nThe next Proposition shows that there exists a kind of \"minimum speed\" for\nall the perturbations in the case of the positively expansive CA.\nProposition 1 If F is a positively expansive CA and \u03bc a shift ergodic and\nF -invariant measure, then there exist a real s > 0 such that M\u03bc (s) = 1\nProof\nFrom [2](Proposition 2), all positively expansive CA has positive pointwise Lyapunov exponents for all point in AZ . More precisely there exist a\n+\n\u2212\nreal \u03b7 > 0 such that lim inf n\u2192\u221e Inn(x) > \u03b7 and lim inf n\u2192\u221e Inn(x) > \u03b7 for all\nx \u2208 AZ .\nIf the velocity of the perturbations is (\u03b7, \u03b7), there would exist an integer\n\u2212\n+\nN > 0 such that for all n \u2265 N we have Inn(x) + Inn(x) > 2\u03b7.\nIn this case for all integer n \u2265 N, p > 0, real 0\u0010 < \u03b4 < 1 and\u0011 x \u2208 AZ ,\n(\u03b7n,\u03b7n)\n(\u03b7n,\u03b7n)\nwe obtain #hTn,\u03b4,p (x)i = 1 which implies that log #Tn,\u03b4,p (x) = 0 and\nconsequently M\u03bc ((\u03b7, \u03b7)) = 1.\n\u2737\nQuestions 2 From Theorem 2, the function M\u03bc (s) from [r, +\u221e) \u2192 [0, 1] is\nclearly continuous and decreasing but what happens in the interval [0, 1]?\nSince \u03bc-expansiveness property is a measurable equivalent to positive\nexpansiveness, we can wonder what values can take the density flow in that\ncase. We will see that there is no such strong relation with the density flow\nbut for the complementary class of CA with \u03bc-equicontinuous points, the\ndensity flow is always equal to zero.\nFrom [3] the existence of equicontinuous points is equivalent to the existence of blocking words that stop completly the propagation of the perturbations. From [8], there exist an example of couple (cellular automaton,\ninvariant and shift ergodic measure \u03bc) without equicontinuous points such\nthat there exists \u03bc-equicontinuous points for the cellular automaton action\n17\n\n\frestricted to the topological support of \u03bc. This example shows clearly than\nthe dynamic of CA with \u03bc-equicontinuous points is clearly more general than\nthose with equicontinuous points when \u03bc is an invariant measure. The next\nProposition shows that the density of flows of the perturbations that can\nmove or not move to infinity (strictly \u03bc-equicontinuous or equicontinuous\ncase) is equal to zero taking in consideration a linear or a sublinear speed.\nProposition 2 If F is a \u03bc-equicontinuous CA, then for all couple of sequence Gn = (gn+ , gn\u2212 ) such that limn\u2192\u221e gn+ + gn\u2212 = +\u221e we have M\u03bc (G) = 0.\nProof\nSuppose there exist a couple of sequence Gn = (gn+ , gn\u2212 ) such that M\u03bc (G)\n> 0 with limn\u2192\u221e gn+ + gn\u2212 = +\u221e. It follows that there if we fixe \u03b4 and p,\nthere exist a set S of positive measure and a real 0 < \u03b1 < 1 such that for all\npoint x \u2208 S we have\n\u0002\n\u0001\u0003\nG\nlim log #hTi(n),\u03b4,p\n(x)i < \u03b1 lim \u2212 log \u03bc Gi(n) \u03b1p\u03c3 (x) ,\nn\u2192\u221e\n\nn\u2192\u221e\n\nwhere i(n) is a subsequence that allows the convergence.\nThen, for n large enough, there exist \u03b1\u2032 such that\n\u0001\u0003\n\u0002\nG\nlog #hTi(n),\u03b4,p\n(x)i < \u03b1 \u2212 log \u03bc Gi(n) \u03b1p\u03c3 (x) .\n\nUsing the same argument as in the proof of Lemma 2, we obtain that for\nn large enough, there exist a subset of S: S \u2032 of positive measure such that\nthere exist a positive k > 1 such that\n\u0001\nP\nGn \u03c3\n\u03bc\n\u03b1\n(y)\np\ny\u2208{n} \u03b1F\n(x)\np\n\u0001 \u2264 k.\nP\nGn \u03b1\u03c3 (y)\nG\np\ny\u2208Tn,\u03b4 (x) \u03bc\nP\nSince \u03bc({n} \u03b1pF (x)) \u2264 y\u2208{n} \u03b1Fp (x) \u03bc(Gn \u03b1p\u03c3 (y)) and when n is large enough\n\u0001\n\u0001\nP\n\u03bc Gn \u03b1p\u03c3 (x) \u2248 e|Gn |h\u03bc (\u03c3) , then \u03bc({n} \u03b1pF (x)) \u2264 (k + 1) y\u2208T G (x) \u03bc Gn \u03b1p\u03c3 (y) .\nn,\u03b4\nIt follows that\nG\n\u03bc({n} \u03b1Fp (x)) \u2264 (k + 1)#hTn,\u03b4,p\n(x)i \u00d7 \u03bc\n\n\u2264 (k + 1)\u03bc\n\nGn\n\n\u0001\u2212\u03b1\n\u03bc\n\u03b1\u03c3p (x)\n\nGn\n\nGn \u03c3\n\u03b1p (x)\n\n\u0001\n\u03b1\u03c3p (x)\n\n\u0001\n\n.\n\nThis implies that for a set of positive measure limn\u2192\u221e \u03bc({n} \u03b1pF (x)) = 0 =\n\u03bc(Bp (x)). From [3] and [8], if there exists a \u03bc-equicontinuous point, then\n18\n\n\fthere exist a set of measure 1 of these kind of points. Hence there is no\n\u03bc-equicontinuous point and we can conclude taking the reverse asumption.\n\u2737\nUsing Proposition 3 (only for linear speed) and Theorem 2, it follows that\nCorollary 1 If \u03bc is a shift ergodic and F -invariant measure, with F a cellular automaton with \u03bc-equicontinuous points, then the measurable entropy\nh\u03bc (F ) = 0.\nRemark 4 If F is a \u03bc-expansive CA then clearly for p, \u03b4 fixed and all x in\na set of positive measure we have\n\u2217\n\n\u2217\n\nI\nlim #Tn,p,\u03b4\n(x) \u00d7 \u03bc(In (x) \u03b1p\u03c3 (x)) = 0\n\nn\u2192\u221e\n\nwhere I \u2217 = (In+,\u2217 (x), I = (In\u2212,\u2217(x)). Remark that this condition is weaker to\nthe property M\u03bc (I \u2217 ) > 0.\nQuestions 3 Is it possible that a dynamical system (cellular automaton F ,\ninvariant measure \u03bc), verify that M\u03bc (I \u2217 ) > 0 and I\u03bc+,\u2217 + I\u03bc\u2212,\u2217 = 0? The sum\nof the exponents I\u03bc+,\u2217 and I\u03bc\u2212,\u2217 is defined by\nZ +,\u2217\nIn (x) + I \u2212,\u2217 (x)\n+,\u2217\n\u2212,\u2217\nI\u03bc + I\u03bc = lim sup\nd\u03bc(x) = 0.\nn\nn\u2192\u221e\nFrom Proposition 2, this CA have to be \u03bc-expansive. In [2], there is an\nexample of \u03bc-expansive CA with I\u03bc+ + I\u03bc\u2212 = 0 but M\u03bc (I \u2217 ) and I\u03bc+,\u2217 and I\u03bc\u2212,\u2217\nare not known.\nWe finish with some more general questions.\nQuestions 4 For h\u03bc (F, \u03b1p ), the bound given by Theorem 1 using the Lyapunov exponents I\u03bc+ + I\u03bc\u2212 did not depends on the choice of the finite partition\n\u03b1p . In what cases the value of M\u03bc (v) does not depends on a supremum value\nover all the partition \u03b1p ?\nQuestions 5 For each cellular automaton F , it is possible to defined the\nfunction M\u03bc (v) when \u03bc is shift ergodic and non F -invariant. What is the\nmeaning of M\u03bc (v) in this case?\nQuestions 6 What kind of results can be done in the topological case?\n19\n\n\fReferences\n[1] F. Blanchard, P. Kurka, A.
