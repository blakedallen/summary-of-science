Such perturbations typically appear when one considers\nproblems that display several different time and/or length scales. In particular, the semiclassical analysis of quantum phenomena and the study of evolution equations in the adiabatic\nregime lead to singularly perturbed linear differential equations which are the object of many\nrecent works. See for example the monographs [14], [11], [13], [29], [40]. The description of certain non conservative phenomena with distinct time scales also gives rise to non-autonoumous\nlinear evolution equations, which are more general than those stemming from conservative\nsystems, and whose adiabatic regime is of physical relevance, see e.g. [32], [33], [41], [35], [36],\n[37], [2], [3], [1].\nThe present paper is devoted to the study of general linear evolution equations in the\nadiabatic limit under some mild spectral conditions on the generator. The chosen set up is\n\n1\n\n\fsufficiently general to cover most applications where the time dependent generator is characterized by a gap condition on its spectrum. Let us describe informally our result, the precise\nTheorem being formulated in Section 2 below.\nWe consider a general linear evolution equation in a Banach space B of the form\ni\u03b5\u2202t U (t, s) = H(t)U (t, s),\n\nU (s, s) = I, s \u2264 t \u2208 [0, 1]\n\n(1.1)\n\nin the adiabatic limit \u03b5 \u2192 0+ , for a time-dependent generator H(t). This equation describes\na rescaled non-autonomous evolution generated by a slowly varying linear operator H(t). The\nevolution operator U (t, s) evidently depends on \u03b5, even though this is not emphasized in the\nnotation.\nThe generator H(t) is assumed to depend analytically on time and to have for any fixed t a\nspectrum \u03c3(H(t)) divided into two disjoint parts, \u03c3(H(t)) = \u03c3(t)\u222a\u03c30 (t), where \u03c3(t) consists in\na finite number of complex eigenvalues \u03c3(t) = {\u03bb1 (t), \u03bb2 (t), * * * , \u03bbn (t)} which remain isolated\nfrom one another as t varies in [0, 1]. Moreover, the spectral projector of H(t) associated with\n\u03c3(t), denoted by P (t), is assumed to be finite dimensional. The part of H(t) which corresponds\nto the spectral projector P0 (t) associated with \u03c30 (t) can be unbounded, bounded or zero. In\nthe first case we need to assume H(t) generates a bona fide evolution operator.\nThis spectral assumption, or gap condition, is familiar in the quantum adiabatic context\nwhere B is a Hilbert space on which H(t) is further assumed to be self-adjoint, see [10], [25],\n[30], [7], [1], for example. Note that it is still possible to study the quantum adiabatic limit by\naltering the gap condition in different ways, as shown in [6], [18], [11], [5], [15], [39], [3], [4].\nBy contrast to previous studies of similar general problems [12], [32], [28], [23], [1], we do\nnot assume that the restriction of H(t) to the spectral subspace P (t)B is diagonalizable. Such\nsituations take place in the study of open quantum systems by means of phenomenological\ntime-dependent master equations, [35], [36], [41], [37]. We come back to the approach of [35]\nbelow.\nTherefore, for the part H(t)P (t) of the generator, we have a complete spectral decomposition\nH(t)P (t) =\n\nn\nX\n\n\u03bbj (t)Pj (t) + Dj (t),\n\n(1.2)\n\nj=1\n\nwhere the Pj (t)'s are eigenprojectors and the Dj (t)'s are eigenilpotents associated to the eigenvalue \u03bbj (t) that satisfy\nn\nX\n\nPj (t) = P (t), Pj (t)Pk (t) = \u03b4jk Pj (t), and Dj (t) = Pj (t)Dj (t)Pj (t).\n\n(1.3)\n\nj=1\n\nIn case B is a Hilbert space on which H(t) is self-adjoint or if H(t) is diagonalizable with real\nsimple isolated eigenvalues only, the evolution U (t, s) follows the instantaneous eigenprojectors\nPj (t) in the adiabatic regime in the sense that\nU (t, s)Pj (s) = Pj (t)U (t, s) + O(\u03b5),\n\n\u03b5 \u2192 0,\n\nas\n\n(1.4)\n\nas shown in [10], [25], [30], [7], [1], and [12], [28], [23], for example. In other words, transitions\nbetween different spectral subspaces are suppressed as \u03b5 \u2192 0. This relation remains true\nfor certain eigenprojectors if the eigenvalues are allowed to have negative imaginary parts,\n[32], [1]. This fact is also well-known and crucial in the study of the Stokes phenomenon\nappearing in singularly perturbed differential equations [14]: under analyticity assumptions,\n\n2\n\n\fone considers certain paths in the complex t-plane, called canonical of dissipative paths, along\nwhich an equivalent of (1.4) is true in order to get bounds on, or to compute exponentially\nsmall quantities in 1/\u03b5 stemming from singularities in the complex t-plane. Such methods are\nused in [20], [21], [23] and [19], to bound or to compute exponentially small transitions in the\nadiabatic limit when the relevant eigenvalues are real on the real axis.\nHowever, when eigenilpotent are present in the spectral decomposition (1.2), the relation\n(1.4) cannot hold in general, even for real valued eigenvalues \u03bbj (t). Indeed, the transitions\nbetween spectral subspaces Pj (t)U (t, 0)Pk (0) are typically exponentially increasing as \u03b5 \u2192 0,\nrather than vanishing as \u03b5. An explicit example of this fact is provided at the end of the\nIntroduction. We come back to this mechanism below.\nIn this context, our main result reads as follows. We construct a different set of timeq \u2217 (\u03b5)\ndependent projectors Pj\n(t) which approximates the eigenprojectors Pj (t) in the adiabatic\nregime \u03b5 \u2192 0. And we show that the evolution U (t, s) can be approximated by a simpler\n\u2217\nq \u2217 (\u03b5)\nevolution, V q (\u03b5) (t, s), which exactly follows the constructed approximations Pj\n(t) of the\ninstantaneous eigenprojectors. In other words, we restore the expected adiabatic behaviour\nby trading the instantaneous eigenprojectors for other nearby projectors in the limit \u03b5 \u2192 0.\nNote that since the eigenvalues need not be real in general, weR also have to take into account\nt\nthe contributions stemming from the \"dynamical phases\" e\u2212i s \u03bbj (u) du/\u03b5 which can be exponentially increasing or decreasing as \u03b5 \u2192 0. In case\nH(t) is unbounded, we assume the part\nR\n\u2212i st \u03bb0 (u) du/\u03b5\nH(t)P0 (t) generates a semigroup bounded by |e\n|, for some function \u03bb0 (t).\nMore precisely, for all j = 1, * * * , n and for any 0 \u2264 t \u2264 1, we construct perturbatively a set\nof projectors close to the spectral projectors of H(t), see Section 5,\nq \u22c6 (\u03b5)\nPj\n(t)\n\n= Pj (t) + O(\u03b5), and\n\nq \u22c6 (\u03b5)\nP0\n(t)\n\n\u2261I\u2212\n\nn\nX\n\nq \u22c6 (\u03b5)\n\nPj\n\n(t).\n\n(1.5)\n\nj=1\n\nq \u22c6 (\u03b5)\n\n\u22c6\n\nLet W q (\u03b5) (t) be the intertwining operator naturally associated with the projectors Pk\nk = 0, * * * , n introduced by Kato [25], such that\nWq\n\n\u22c6 (\u03b5)\n\nq \u22c6 (\u03b5)\n\n(t)Pk\n\nq \u22c6 (\u03b5)\n\n(0) = Pk\n\n(t)W q\n\n\u22c6 (\u03b5)\n\nk = 0, * * * , n.\n\n(t),\n\n(t),\n\n(1.6)\n\nThe approximation is then defined by\nVq\n\n\u22c6 (\u03b5)\n\n(t, 0) = W q\n\n\u22c6 (\u03b5)\n\n(t)\u03a6q\n\n\u22c6 (\u03b5)\n\n(t, 0)\n\n(1.7)\nq \u22c6 (\u03b5)\n\n\u22c6\n\n(0), k = 0, * * * , n for any t and satisfies a certain\nwhere \u03a6q (\u03b5) (t, s) commutes with all the Pk\nsingularly perturbed linear differential equation, see (6.17) below, which describes the effective\nq \u22c6 (\u03b5)\n(0)B. Therefore, the following exact intertwining\nevolution within the fixed subspaces Pk\nrelation holds\nVq\n\n\u22c6 (\u03b5)\n\nq \u22c6 (\u03b5)\n\n(t, 0)Pk\n\nq \u22c6 (\u03b5)\n\n(0) = Pk\n\n(t)V q\n\n\u22c6 (\u03b5)\n\nk = 0, * * * , n.\n\n(t, 0),\n\n(1.8)\n\nIntroducing \u03c9(t) = maxk=0,***,n I\u03bbk (t) to control the norm of the \"dynamical phases\", we prove\nthe existence of \u03ba > 0 such that for any 0 \u2264 t \u2264 1\nU (t, 0) = V q\n\u22c6\n\n\u22c6 (\u03b5)\n\nRt\n\n(t, 0) + O(te\u2212\u03ba/\u03b5 e\nRt\n\n0\n\n\u03c9(u) du/\u03b5\n\u03b2\n\n),\n\n(1.9)\n\nwhere kV q (\u03b5) (t, 0)k = O(e 0 \u03c9(u) du/\u03b5 eD/\u03b5 ), for some D \u2265 0 and 0 < \u03b2 < 1. Note that the\nleading term is always meaningful with respect to the exponentially smaller error term.\n\n3\n\n\fIn case B is a Hilbert space and H(t) is self-adjoint, both the evolution and its approximation are unitary and D can be chosen equal to zero. The intertwining identity (1.8) and\nq \u22c6 (\u03b5)\n(1.9) show that the transitions between the different subspaces Pj\n(0)B are exponentially\nsmall in \u03b5, instead of being of order \u03b5 between the spectral subspaces of H. Constructions\n\u22c6\nleading to approximations V q (\u03b5) of this type with exponentially small error term go under\nthe name superadiabtic renormalization, according to the terminology coined by Berry [9], in\nthis quantum adiabatic context. The first general rigorous construction of this type appears\nin [31], but we shall use that of [22]. The statement (1.9) is thus very similar to the Adiabatic\nTheorem of quantum mechanics [25], [30], [7], [1]... and, more precisely, to the subsequent\nexponentially accurate versions in an analytic context provided in [21], [31], [22], [24], [16],\n[17]... or variants therof. However, while the improvement of the error term in (1.9) from O(\u03b5)\nq \u22c6 (\u03b5)\nto O(e\u2212\u03ba/\u03b5 ) by considering Pj\nin place of Pj in the adiabatic context is just that, improvement, in case there are non-zero nilpotents in the decomposition (1.2), it becomes necessary\nq \u22c6 (\u03b5)\nto consider Pj\nand achieve exponential accuracy to get a result.\nq \u22c6 (\u03b5)\n\nThis can be understood as follows.

The growth in e1/\u03b2j of adiabatic\nevolutions generated by certain nilpotents is already present the works [42] and [38]. Hence,\nq \u22c6 (\u03b5)\nto compensate the exponential growth in 1/\u03b5\u03b2j of the \u03a8j (t, 0)'s which induces transitions\nbetween the instantaneous eigenspaces of the same order, see the example below, it is necessary\nq \u22c6 (\u03b5)\nto push the estimates to exponential order, see (1.9), by trading the Pj 's for the Pj\n. This\nrequires analyticity of the data, see Section 5. Analyticity is also essential in Section 4 where\nthe properties of nilpotent generators and the adiabatic evolutions they generate are studied.\nLet us finally comment on the paper [35]. It addresses, at a theoretical physics level, the\nevolution of master equations describing open quantum systems in which the components of\nthe Lindblad generator are slowly varying functions of time. Mathematically, this corresponds\n\n4\n\n\fto a particular case of problem (1.1) with a generator containing nilpotents in its decomposition\n(1.2). The authors argue under certain implicit conditions on the evolution, that it is possible\nto approximate U (t, 0) by some operator V \u03b5 (t, 0) which satisfies the intertwining relation (1.8)\nq \u22c6 (\u03b5)\n(t) =\nwith the instantaneous projectors Pj (t) in place of the approximate projectors Pj\nPj (t) + O(\u03b5). However, as we prove, such a statement cannot be true in general. It does hold,\nhowever, under the hypotheses of [1], that is when the nilpotent part of the generator in the\ncorresponding subspace Pj (t)B is absent, together with an a priori bound on the evolution\n(see also remark iii) at the end of the Section). Or, when the considered spectral subspace\nPj (t)B is always decoupled from the others, otherwise the error term becomes too large due\nto the growth (1.13). An example of this sort is indeed provided in [35].\nThe paper is organized as follows. We close the introduction by the example alluded to\nabove and then provide the precise hypotheses and the mathematical statement corresponding\nto our main result. The rest of the paper is devoted to the proof of it. The main steps\nconsists in Section 4 which studies adiabatic evolutions generated by (perturbations of) analytic\nnilpotents. The iterative scheme providing the adiabatic renormalization of [22] is shortly\nrecalled in Section 5. The approximations and its properties are presented in Section 6.\nAcknowledgement: The author would like to thank C. Ogabi, R.

We show that\nthis nilpotent induces exponentially increasing transitions (in 1/\u03b5\u03b2 , \u03b2 < 1) between the instantaneous eigenspaces, thereby underlying the necessity to use superadiabatic renormalization\nq \u2217 (\u03b5)\nto achieve our result. We also identify the approximated projectors Pj\nthat the evolution\nfollows.\nLet H be a constant 3 \u00d7 3 matrix in canonical basis {e1 , e2 , e3 } defined by\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n0 a 0\nH = \uf8ed0 0 0\uf8f8\n0 0 1\n\nand let L be another\n\uf8eb\n0 0\n\uf8ed\nL = \u2212k 0\n0 0\n\nconstant 3 \u00d7 3 matrix defined by\n\uf8f6\n\u2212k\n0 \uf8f8,\n0\n\n(1.14)\n\n(1.15)\n\nwhere the non-zero scalars a, k will be chosen later on.

Note that\nP\u00b1 (\u03b5) \u2243 \u00b1a/ \u03b5ak as \u03b5 \u2192 0. Whereas the projectors\nP1 (\u03b5) = P1 + O(\u03b5)\n\n(1.23)\n\nP0 (\u03b5) = P+ (\u03b5) + P\u2212 (\u03b5) = P0 + O(\u03b5)\n\n(1.24)\n\nadmit expansions in powers of \u03b5.

Since Pk (t)U (t, 0)Pj (0) =\nS(t)Pk \u03a9(t)Pj , j, k \u2208 {0, 1}, where S(t) is independent of \u03b5, it is enough to compute Pk \u03a9(t)Pj\nto get the behaviour in \u03b5 of the transitions between the corresponding instantaneous subspaces.\nWe get for t > 0 and P1 = e3 he3 |,\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n\u2212 \u03b5k\n2\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\uf8ec 3/2 2 \uf8f7\n(1.27)\nP0 \u03a9(t)P1 = et |ak|/ \u03b5 \uf8ed i\u03b5\u221a k \uf8f8 he3 | + O(\u03b5), as \u03b5 \u2192 0\n2\n\n|ak|\n\n0\n\nP1 \u03a9(t)P0 \u2261 0\n\n(1.28)\n\nThe first formula thus implies that the evolution U (t, 0) does not follow the instantaneous\neigenprojector P1 (t), whereas the second formula simply reflects the non-generic fact that P0\nis invariant under H \u2212 \u03b5L in our example, see the remarks below.\nThe model being explicitly solvable, we can readily identify the approximated projectors\nthe evolution follows. Setting for j = 0, 1\nPj\u2217 (t, \u03b5) := S(t)Pj (\u03b5)S \u22121 (t) = Pj (t) + O(\u03b5),\n\n6\n\n(1.29)\n\n\fwe compute by means of (1.25) and (1.23)\nU (t, 0)Pj\u2217 (0, \u03b5) = Pj\u2217 (t, \u03b5)U (t, 0).\n\n(1.30)\n\nThus the evolution U (t, 0) exactly follows the projectors (1.29) whereas the transition from\n\u221a\nP1 (0) to P0 (t) are exponentially large in 1/ \u03b5.\nRemarks:\ni) If the product ak \u2208 C \\ R+ , a similar result holds. We took ak < 0 for simplicity. If the\nproduct ak is positive, the transition does vanish in the limit \u03b5 \u2192 0. This is due to the fact that\nthe spectral projector P0 corresponding to the unperturbed eigenvalue 0 of H is of dimension\n2. For the natural generalization of this example with dim P0 = d, d > 2, the following holds.\nGenerically, the splitting of the unique eigenvalue zero of the nilpotent P0 H by a perturbation\nof order \u03b5 yields d perturbed eigenvalues \u03bbj (\u03b5) \u2243 \u03b1\u03b51/d ej2i\u03c0/d , j = 0, * * * , d \u2212 1, \u03b1 \u2208 C, see [26].\nHence, one of them has a non vanishing imaginary part that produces exponentially growing\ncontributions as \u03b5 \u2192 0.\nii) As already mentioned, this example is non-generic in the sense that P0 is invariant under\n\u03a9(t), see (1.28). The choice of non-generic L (1.15) was made to keep the formulas simple.\nHowever, as should be clear from the analysis, a generic choice for L implies an exponential\nincrease as \u03b5 \u2192 0 for both P1 \u03a9(t)P0 and P0 \u03a9(t)P1 , when ak \u2208 C \\ R+ .\niii) The real unperturbed eigenvalues 0 and 1 can be replaced by any different complex numbers\n\u03bb0 and \u03bb1 without difficulty. The main consequence is that the exponents in (1.25) have to\nbe changed according to \u03bb\u00b1 (\u03b5) 7\u2192 \u03bb0 + \u03bb\u00b1 (\u03b5) and 1 7\u2192 \u03bb1 . One can assume without loss that\nI\u03bbj \u2264 0, j = 0, 1. Observe that if \u03bb0 is real and I\u03bb1 < 0, conclusions similar to (1.27) can be\ndrawn. In case I\u03bb0 < 0 and \u03bb1 is real, the transition P0 \u03a9(t)P1 is of order \u03b5, \u03b5 \u2192 0. This is a\ncase where the results of [1] apply, since the evolution (1.25) becomes uniformly bounded in \u03b5\ndue to the exponential decay stemming from I\u03bb0 < 0.\n\n2\n\nMain Result\n\nLet us specify here our hypotheses and state our result.\nLet a > 0 and Sa = {z \u2208 C | dist(z, [0, 1]) < a}.\nH1:\nLet {H(z)}z\u2208S\u0304a be a family of closed operators densely defined on a common domain D of a\nBanach space B and for any \u03c6 \u2208 D, the map z 7\u2192 H(z)\u03c6 is analytic in Sa .\nAs a consequence, the resolvent R(z, \u03bb) = (H(z) \u2212 \u03bb)\u22121 is locally analytic in z for \u03bb \u2208\n\u03c1(H(z)), where \u03c1(H(z)) denotes the resolvent set of H(z).\nH2:\nFor t \u2208 [0, 1], the spectrum of H(t) is of the form \u03c3(H(t)) = \u03c3(t) \u222a \u03c30 (t), and there exists\nG > 0 such that\ninf dist(\u03c3(t), \u03c30 (t)) \u2265 G.\nt\u2208[0,1]\n\nMoreover, \u03c3(t) = {\u03bb1 (t), \u03bb2 (t), * * * , \u03bbn (t)} where \u03bbj (t), j = 1, * * * , n, n < \u221e, are eigenvalues of\nconstant multiplicity mj < \u221e such that\ninf dist(\u03bbj (t), \u03bbk (t)) \u2265 G.\n\nt\u2208[0,1]\nj6=k\n\n7\n\n\fLet \u0393j \u2208 \u03c1(H(t)) be a loop encircling \u03bbj (t) only.

It is a classical perturbative fact, see [26],\nthat H2 also holds for the spectrum of H(z) with z \u2208 Sa , provided a is small enough, and\nthat the eigenvalues are analytic functions in Sa . By this we mean that the inf t\u2208[0,1] can be\nreplaced by inf t\u2208Sa in H2. Hence, (2.1) also holds for z \u2208 Sa and z 7\u2192 Pk (z) is analytic in Sa ,\nfor k = 0, . . . , n. Consequently, the eigenilpotents given by Dj (z) = (H(z) \u2212 \u03bbj (z))Pj (z) are\nanalytic in Sa as well.\nWe now state a technical hypothesis needed to deal with evolution operators generated by\nunbounded generators. In case one works with bounded operators only, this hypothesis is not\nnecessary.\nH3:\nLet H0 (t) = P0 (t)H(t)P0 (t). There exists a C 1 complex valued function t 7\u2192 \u03bb0 (t) such that\nfor all t \u2208 [0, 1], H0 (t) + \u03bb0 (t) generates a contraction semigroup and 0 \u2208 \u03c1((H0 (t) + \u03bb0 (t)).\nIn other words, H3 says that the solution T (s) = e\u2212i\u03bb0 (t)s e\u2212iH0 (t)s to the strong equation\non D i\u2202s T (s) = (H0 (t) + \u03bb0 (t))T (s) satisfies kT (s)k \u2264 1, for all s \u2265 0.

Let B(t) be linear, bounded\nand strongly continuous in t \u2208 [0, 1]. Assume there exist two-parameter evolution operators\nT (t, s) and S(t, s) associated with the equations\ni\u2202t T (t, s)\u03c6 = A(t)T (t, s)\u03c6,\n\nT (s, s) = I,\n\ni\u2202t S(t, s)\u03c6 = (A(t) + B(t))S(t, s)\u03c6,\n\nS(s, s) = I,\n\n(3.1)\n(3.2)\n\nfor all \u03c6 \u2208 D and s \u2264 t \u2208 [0, 1]. Then, for any \u03c6 \u2208 D, and any r \u2264 s \u2264 t \u2208 [0, 1],\ni\u2202s (T (t, s)S(s, r)\u03c6) = T (t, s)B(s)S(s, r)\u03c6,\n\n(3.3)\n\nso that by integration on s between r and t,\nZ t\ndsT (t, s)B(s)S(s, r)\u03c6.\nS(t, r)\u03c6 = T (t, r)\u03c6 \u2212 i\n\n(3.4)\n\nr\n\nIterating this formula, we deduce the representation\nZ sn\u22121\nZ s1\nZ t\nX\nn\ndsn\nds2 * * *\nS(t, r) =\n(\u2212i)\nds1\nr\n\nn\u22650\n\n\u00d7\n\nr\n\nr\n\nT (t, s1 )B(s1 )T (s1 , s2 )B(s2 ) * * * B(sn )T (sn , r).\n\n(3.5)\n\nFurther assuming that T (t, s) satisfies the bound\nRt\n\nkT (t, s)k \u2264 M e\n\ns\n\n\u03c9(u)du\n\n,\n\n(3.6)\n\nfor a constant M and a real valued integrable function u 7\u2192 \u03c9(u), we get from (3.5)\nRt\n\nkS(t, s)k \u2264 M e\n\nr (\u03c9(u)+M kB(u)k) du\n\n.\n\n(3.7)\n\nAs a first application of (3.7), we get from (2.5) a first estimate on U (t, s) that we will improve\nlater on\nRt\n\nkU (t, s)k \u2264 e\n\ns\n\n(I\u03bb0 (u)+kP (u)H(u)P (u)k) du/\u03b5\n\n.\n\n10\n\n(3.8)\n\n\f4\n\nNilpotent Generators\n\nFor later purposes, we study here the adiabatic evolution generated by an analytic nilpotent,\nin a finite dimensional space. We assume\nN1:\nFor any z \u2208 Sa , N (z) is an analytic nilpotent valued operator in a linear space B of finite\ndimension such that for a fixed integer d \u2265 0, N (z)d \u2261 0.\nThe detailed analysis of the properties of analytic nilpotent matrices is performed in Section\n5 of the book [8]. It is shown in particular that such operators have the following structure.\nFor any nilpotent N (z) satisfying N1 in Sa , there exists a finite set of points Z0 \u2282 Sa\u2032 , with\na\u2032 < a, and, there exists a family of invertible operators {S(z)}z\u2208Sa\u2032 \\Z0 such that for any\nz \u2208 Sa\u2032 \\ Z0 ,\nN (z) = S \u22121 (z)N S(z)\n\n(4.1)\n\nwith S(z) and S \u22121 (z) meromorphic in Sa\u2032 and regular in Sa\u2032 \\ Z0 . The set Z0 where N (z) is\nnot similar to the constant nilpotent N is called the set of weakly splitting points of N (z). At\nthese points, the range and kernel of N (z) change.\nWe consider Y (t, s), defined as the solution to\n\u03b5\u2202t Y (t, s) = N (t)Y (t, s), Y (s, s) = I, \u2200s, t \u2208 [0, 1],\n\n(4.2)\n\nand estimate the way Y (t, s) depends on \u03b5, as \u03b5 \u2192 0. Note that we don't need to impose s \u2264 t\nsince we deal with bounded generators.\nIn case N is constant, with N d\u22121 6= 0, Y (t, s) = e(t\u2212s)N/\u03b5 behaves polynomially in 1/\u03b5,\ni.e. like ((t \u2212 s)/\u03b5)d\u22121 , as \u03b5 \u2192 0. When N (t) is not constant, one may expect that Y (t, s)\nexplodes less fast than ec/\u03b5 , which is the worst behavious as \u03b5 \u2192 0 for bounded generators. In\nsuch cases, however, Y (t, s) grows typically faster than polynomially in 1/\u03b5, as the following\nexample shows. For N (z) given by\n\u0012\n\u0013\nt \u22121\nN (t) =\n,\n(4.3)\nt2 \u2212t\nwe get that the solution Y (t, 0) to (4.2) reads\nY (t, 0) =\n\n\u2212 \u221a1\u03b5 sinh( \u221at\u03b5 )\ncosh( \u221at\u03b5 )\n\u221a\nt cosh( \u221at\u03b5 ) \u2212 \u03b5 sinh( \u221at\u03b5 ) cosh( \u221at\u03b5 ) \u2212 \u221at\u03b5 sinh( \u221at\u03b5 )\n\n!\n\n,\n\n(4.4)\n\n\u221a\n\nwhich behaves as et/ \u03b5 , when \u03b5 \u2192 0. The growth is nevertheless slower than exponential\nin 1/\u03b5. We show that the characteristic behaviour of Y generated by an analytic nilpotent\noperator is similar. For later purposes, we actually consider generators given by an order \u03b5\nperturbation of a nilpotent.\nProposition 4.1 Suppose the nilpotent N (t) satisfies N1 and let {A(t)}t\u2208[0,1] be a C 0 family\nof operators on B. Then, there exist c > 0 and 0 < \u03b2 < 1 such that the solution Y (t, s) of\n\u03b5\u2202t Y (t, s) = (N (t) + \u03b5A(t))Y (t, s), Y (s, s) = I, \u2200s, t \u2208 [0, 1],\n\n11\n\n(4.5)\n\n\fsatisfies uniformly in t, s \u2208 [0, 1]\n\n\u03b2\n\nkY (t, s)k \u2264 cec/\u03b5 .\n\nRemarks:\ni) Asymptotic expansions as \u03b5 \u2192 0 of solutions to such equations are derived in [42], [38], in\nthe neighbourhood of points which are not weakly splitting points for N (z).\nii) In case both 0 and 1 are not weakly splitting points, it is possible to take \u03b2 = (d \u2212 1)/d,\nwhich is the optimal exponent, see the example. As we shall not need such improvements, we\ndon't give a proof.\niii) The adiabatic evolution generated by an analytic nilpotent does not have to grow exponentially fast in 1/\u03b5\u03b2 , as \u03b5 \u2192 0. Consider for example (4.3) and (4.4) along the imaginary t-axis.\nHowever, such evolutions cannot be uniformly bounded in \u03b5, as the next Lemma shows, under\nslightly stronger conditions.\niv) It is actually enough to assume t 7\u2192 kA(t)k is uniformly bounded on [0, 1].\nLemma 4.1 Assume {N (t)}t\u2208[0,1] is a C 1 family of nilpotents and {A(t)}t\u2208[0,1] is a C 1 family\nof operators on B. Consider Y (t, s) the solution to (4.5). Then\nsup kY (t, s)k < \u221e \u21d0\u21d2 N (u) \u2261 0 \u2200s \u2264 u \u2264 t.\n\u03b5>0\n\nProof of Proposition 4.1: The proof consists in two steps. First we prove the result for\ngenerators with more structure and then, making use of the results of Section 5 in [8] on the\ndetailed structure of analytic nilpotents, we extend it to the general case.\nLemma 4.2 Assume N (t) = S \u22121 (t)N S(t) where N satisfies N d = 0 and where {S(t)}t\u2208[0,1]\nis a C 1 family of invertible operators. Let {A(t)}t\u2208[0,1] be a C 0 family of operators and set\nB(t) = S(t)A(t)S \u22121 (t) + S \u2032 (t)S \u22121 (t). Then, there exists c > 0 such that the solution Y (t, s)\nof (4.5) satisfies\nkY (t, s)k \u2264 kS \u22121 (t)kkS(s)k\n\nc\n\u03b5(d\u22121)/d\n\nRt\n\ne\n\ns\n\n(1+ckB(u)k)du/\u03b5(d\u22121)/d\n\n, \u2200s \u2264 t \u2208 [0, 1].\n\nRemarks:\n0) The constant c depends on N only. R\ns\ni) If s \u2265 t, the same estimate holds with t kB(u)kdu in the exponent.\nii) This Lemma also holds in infinite dimension.\nProof of Lemma 4.2: Let Z(t, s) = S(t)Y (t, s)S \u22121 (s). This operator satisfies by construction\n\u03b5\u2202t Z(t, s) = (N + \u03b5B(t))Z(t, s), Z(s, s) = I, \u2200s, t \u2208 [0, 1].\n\n(4.6)\n\nLet us compare Z(t, s) with\nZ0 (t, s) = eN (t\u2212s)/\u03b5 , s, t \u2208 [0, 1]\nby means of (3.5).
