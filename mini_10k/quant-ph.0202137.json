HYDRODYNAMICAL FORMULATION OF\nQUANTUM MECHANICS\n\nTo establish connections between quantum mechanics\nand fluid dynamics\nwe write the wave function in the form\np\n\u03a8(~r, t) = \u03c1(~r, t) exp(i\u03c7(~r, t)) [2], (where \u03c1(~r, t) stands\nfor density of a probability fluid) and define the velocity\nfield\n~v =\n\nh\u0304 ~\n\u2207\u03c7(~r, t).\nm\n\n(1)\n\nProvided ~v and its partial derivatives are well defined, we\nmay rewrite the Schr\u00f6dinger equation [with a potential\nV (~r, t)] in the form\nI. INTRODUCTION\n\nm\nVortices can be found both in classical and quantum\nphysics. One can encounter vortices, for instance, in water that spins around or in the air as a ring of smoke\n[1]. Quantum mechanics can be formulated in a language\nof hydrodynamics (see e.g. [2,3] and references therein).\nSuch a formulation (very useful also in quantum chemistry [2]) provides a basis for definition of topological defects like vortices [4], whose features are even more striking than those that we find in classical physics. Quantum\nvortices appear not only in systems described by the linear Schr\u00f6dinger equation. Indeed, they were experimentally observed in superfluid HeII [5] and a Bose-Einstein\ncondensate (BEC) of trapped alkali atoms [6,7] which\nare typically described, within the mean-field approximation, by a nonlinear equation [8].\nIn hydrodynamics of ordinary non-viscous fluids, the\ncirculation of the velocity field is conserved in time evolution due to the celebrated Helmholtz-Kelvin theorem\n(HKT) [9]. This theorem is often employed in quantum\nmechanics [3,4,10,11]. However, uncritical usage of the\nHKT, may lead to the incorrect conclusion that stability of vortices and vortex rings in quantum fluids is fully\nguaranteed by the HKT [11]. In the present paper we\ndiscuss the basic assumptions of the HKT and show analytical examples where these assumptions can be easily\nbroken by quantum evolution of the wave function, leading to changes of the topological charge. Difficulties in\nfulfilling the assumptions of the HKT have been already\npointed out in conclusions of Ref. [12].\n\n\u2202~v ~\n+\u2207\n\u2202t\n\n\u0012\n\n\u221a \u0013\nh\u03042 \u22072 \u03c1\n1\nmv 2 + V \u2212\n= 0,\n\u221a\n2\n2m\n\u03c1\n\n(2)\n\n\u2202\u03c1 ~\n+ \u2207 * (~v \u03c1) = 0.\n\u2202t\n\n(3)\n\nEquation (3) is an ordinary continuity equation, while\nEq. (2), in the limit of h\u0304 \u2192 0, becomes similar to the\ndynamical equation of a curl-free non-viscous fluid [9].\nIn quantum mechanics the wave function has to be\nsingle valued. To satisfy this condition one arrives at\nthe Feynman-Onsager quantization condition [13] for the\ncirculation of the velocity field \u0393C around any closed contour C\nI\n2\u03c0h\u0304\n~v * d~l = n\n\u0393C =\n,\n(4)\nm\nC\nwhere n = 0, \u00b11, \u00b12, . . .. Due to the definition (1), we\nmay not expect n 6= 0 unless at a certain point on a sur~ \u00d7 ~v becomes singular\nface encircled by the contour C, \u2207\n(behaves as a Dirac delta function, see for example [5]).\nWe refer to n as a topological charge since any continuous\ndeformation of the contour C, which does not incorporate any other points where curl of the velocity field does\nnot vanish, can not change \u0393C .\nIII. THE HELMHOLTZ-KELVIN THEOREM\n\nOne may ask whether the circulation \u0393C is conserved\nin time evolution of the velocity field. For a fixed contour,\na possibly moving vortex may leave an area bounded by\nthe contour and consequently \u0393C changes its value. Thus,\nthe relevant situation we should consider corresponds to\n\n\fthe case where we let an initially defined contour evolve\nin time according to the velocity field.\nParameterizing the initial contour by \u03be variable, i.e.\nC(t0 ) = {~r(\u03be, t0 )}, and employing the equation of motion\nof a contour\nd\n~r(\u03be, t) = ~v [~r(\u03be, t)],\ndt\n\n(5)\n\nyields\n\n\u03a8(x, y) \u221d (x + i\u03b1y)e\u2212(x\n\nd\n\u0393C(t) =\ndt\n\nC(t)\n\n\u0012\n\n\u2202~v\n~ 2\n~ v + 1 \u2207v\n+ (~v * \u2207)~\n\u2202t\n2\n\n\u0013\n\n* d~l.\n\n(7)\n\nIV. ANALYTICAL EXAMPLES\n\nIn this section we discuss a few possibilities of breaking\nof the HKT. To this end we analyze three different analytically solvable examples where breaking of the HKT\nbecomes evident.\nFirst example shows that changes of the topological\ncharge of a vortex correspond to the appearance of a\nnodal line of the wave function. In Ref. [14] the authors\nshow the instability of a vortex placed in an anisotropic\ntwo-dimensional harmonic trap. We would like to discuss\nthe source of violation of the HKT in such a case. We\nwill calculate the velocity field and analyze changes of its\ncirculation from a point of view of the HKT.\nConsider an anisotropic two-dimensional harmonic oscillator with the potential\n1 2 \u03bb2 2\nx + y ,\n2\n2\n\n(9)\n\n\u03b1 cos(Et)\n(\u2212y~ex + x~ey ),\nx2 + y 2 \u03b12 + 2\u03b1xy sin(Et)\n(10)\n\n(where E = \u03bb \u2212 1 is the energy difference of the two\nlowest excited states) reveals that for Et \u2208 [0, \u03c0/2), \u0393C\ncorresponds to n = 1 while for Et \u2208 (\u03c0/2, \u03c0] to n = \u22121.\nTo discuss applicability of the HKT we have to investigate time evolution of the initially defined contour.\nThe problem requires careful treatment because for Et =\n\u03c0/2 \u2212 \u03b5 (where \u03b5 \u2192 0+ ) the velocity field goes to zero\neverywhere except on the nodal line, x + \u03b1y = 0, where\n1\nit diverges ~v \u2192 \u03b5x\n(~ex + \u03b1~ey ). To demonstrate violation\nof the HKT we have to show that a contour initially encircling the center is not extended to infinity but indeed\nfaces singularity for Et = \u03c0/2.\n\n1.5\n1\n0.5\n\ny\n\nEquation (7) establishes the Helmholtz-Kelvin theorem\noriginally proved for a non-viscous fluid [9]. Applicability of this theorem to a non-linear quantum systems is\npresented in the Appendix.\nThe HKT is fulfilled provided the contour C(t) that\ngoes initially through points where the velocity field is\nwell defined will evolve in time through such points only.\nIn the following we will see how such an assumption may\nbe broken by quantum evolution of the wave function\nleading to a change of the topological charge.\n\nV (x, y) =\n\n,\n\n(6)\n\nIf the contour is drawn through points where the velocity\nfield ~v and its partial derivatives are well defined, apply~ v = 1 \u2207v\n~ 2 \u2212 ~v \u00d7 (\u2207\n~ \u00d7 ~v ), and\ning: Eq. (2), equality (~v * \u2207)~\n2\n~ \u00d7 ~v = 0,\nusing the fact that, at least on the contour \u2207\nwe get\nd\n\u0393C(t) = 0.\ndt\n\n+\u03bby 2 )/2\n\nwith a real parameter \u03b1 > 0. Choosing any contour\nC that encircles the origin of the coordinate frame we\nfind out that the circulation \u0393C corresponds to n = 1\nvortex. However, the circulation around that point is\nnot conserved in time. Indeed, analysis of time evolution\nof the velocity field\n~v (x, y, t) =\n\nI\n\n2\n\n(8)\n\n(where we use the units of the harmonic oscillator corresponding to the x-direction). The initial wave function\nis prepared as a superposition of the two lowest excited\nstates\n\n0\n\n-0.5\n-1\n-1.5\n-1\n\n-0.5\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\nx\nFIG. 1. Plot of the contour encircling the center of the trap\nfor Et \u2192 \u03c0/2 (dashed line). The contour was initially (t = 0)\nchosen to be a circle with the unit radius centered at (0.5, 0)\n(solid line). The thick solid line represents the nodal line\ngiven by the equation x + \u03b1y = 0. Initially, the point of the\ncontour closest to the origin of the coordinates is situated at\nthe distance 0.5. Therefore in course of the evolution none of\nthe points of the contour can get closer to the origin than at\nthe distance 0.5, i.e. can not cross the dotted circle with the\nradius 0.5 that is\u221acentered at (0, 0). For this presentation we\nhave chosen \u03bb = 2, \u03b1 = 1 - see text for details.\n\nSuppose we define a contour, encircling the origin, at\na time t = 0, and look for a time evolution of its arbi-\n\n\ftrary point i, whose position we denote by {xi (t), yi (t)}.\nCombining Eq. (5) and Eq. (10) we get\ndxi\n= \u2212f (xi , yi ) yi ,\ndt\n\ndyi\n= f (xi , yi ) xi ,\ndt\n\nreduces to a point. Consequently, at t = 1, the contour\nmust go through a singularity of the velocity field and\nthe integral (6) and also the HKT become meaningless.\n\n(11)\n\nwith\nf (x, y) =\n\nx2\n\n+\n\ny2\n\n\u03b1 cos(Et)\n.\n\u03b12 + 2\u03b1xy sin(Et)\n\n(12)\n\nFrom Eq. (11) it is apparent that the distance of the point\n{xi (t), yi (t)} from the origin does not change in course\nof the evolution. Indeed the quantity xi (t)2 + yi (t)2 is a\nconstant of motion as long as the function (12) is well defined. Note that it diverges, at Et = \u03c0/2, for points lying\non the nodal line. Therefore, for Et = \u03c0/2 \u2212 \u03b5 with arbitrary small \u03b5 > 0 nothing extraordinary happens with\nthe contour until at Et = \u03c0/2 the contour faces singularity (see Fig. 1 for an example of the contour evolution).\nThus, the HKT can not be applied because quantum evolution of the wave function pushes an evolving contour\nto singular points and the quantities involved in the theorem become undefined.\nWe would like to stress that the presented scenario\nwhere the vortex situated in the harmonic trap reveals\nperiodic changes of the topological charge is possible only\nwhen the initial vortex is placed exactly at the center\nof the potential. Otherwise the vortex changes its position - it escapes to infinity and another vortex with\nthe opposite charge arrives from infinity and the scenario\nrepeats periodically.\nIn the second example we would like to present violation of the HKT due to annihilation of a vortex ring.\nThis example comes from Ref. [4] where creation and\nannihilation of a vortex ring for freely moving particle is\npresented. Even though it is not clearly stated in Ref. [4],\nthe HKT is not fulfilled in that case. The wave function\nof a vortex ring [4] (in dimensionless units) may be written in the form\n\u03a8(x, y, z, t) \u221d [(x \u2212 kt)2 + y 2 + z 2 \u2212 1\n+ i3(z + t)]eikx\u2212ik\n\n2\n\nt/2\n\n,\n\n(13)\n\nwhere the wave vector ~k = (k, 0, 0) is related to a motion\nof the \"center of mass\" of the vortex ring with a constant\nvelocity ~k. The vortex ring corresponds to the nodal line\nof the wave function and is located at the intersection of\nthe plane z + t = 0 and sphere (x \u2212 kt)2 + y 2 + z 2 = 1.\nAt time t = \u22121, the vortex is born at a point (\u2212k, 0, 1)\nand, at time t = 1, it disappears at a point\n\u221a (k, 0, \u22121).\nThe radius of the vortex changes in time as 1 \u2212 t2 .\nSuppose at any time t \u2208 (\u22121, 1), we define a contour\nC so that it encircles the vortex (see Fig. 2) and the\ncirculation of the velocity field corresponds to n = 1. The\nevolving contour can not cross the vortex ring without\nfacing a singularity in the velocity field. However, the\nring at some moment starts shrinking and at t = 1 it\n\nFIG. 2. Schematic plot of the nodal line corresponding to\na vortex ring (solid line) and a contour that encircles the ring\n(dashed line). In last stage of time evolution the ring shrinks\nto a point and the contour faces singularity.\n\nThe last example we would like to comment on shows\ncollision of two vortices leading to the appearance of a\nsingle doubly charged vortex. Consider, for simplicity,\na two-dimensional H atom initially in the first excited\nstate with angular momentum Lz = 1 [i.e. \u03c81 (r, \u03c6) \u221d\nr exp(\u22122r/3) exp(i\u03c6) in atomic units] that is driven resonantly by a circularly polarized electromagnetic field.\nThe field frequency is tuned to the transition between\nthe first and second excited energy eigenstates. It results\nin the familiar Rabi oscillation [15] between the \u03c81 (r, \u03c6)\nstate and the second excited state with angular momentum Lz = 2 [i.e. \u03c82 (r, \u03c6) \u221d r2 exp(\u22122r/5) exp(i2\u03c6)].\nIndeed, the time evolution of the wavefunction reads\n|\u03c8(t)i \u221d cos(Dt)e\u2212iE1 t |\u03c81 i + e\u2212iE2 t sin(Dt) |\u03c82 i , (14)\n\nwhere D is a dipole matrix element [15]; E1 , E2 are energies of |\u03c81 i, |\u03c82 i states.\nFor t = 0 there is a vortex with n = 1 at the center\nof the coordinates as expected for the state with angular\nmomentum Lz = 1. When Dt increases another vortex\nwith n = 1 moves in from infinity, collides with the first\none (situated at the center of the coordinates during the\nwhole time evolution) at Dt = \u03c0/2 and then moves out\nto infinity again and so on. During the collision, i.e. for\nDt = \u03c0/2, a single vortex with n = 2 is formed. In the\nconsidered example, the HKT does not apply: if we define a contour so that it encircles the vortex with n = 1\nsituated at the center of the coordinate, such a contour\nencounters a singularity in the velocity field during the\ncollision with the other vortex. Such a behavior, is expected to hold in an arbitrary collision between two vortices leading to formation of one, doubly charged, vortex.\nThese examples are not the only ones illustrating that\nvortices can disappear or change their charge in the\ncourse of time evolution. They were chosen to illustrate\nthat such processes can happen in different physical systems and results in the violation of the HKT. The theorem is explored in the context of vortices' stability (see\ne.g. [11]) to imply the constancy of a vortex topological\ncharge. As we have clearly illustrated the HKT can not\nassure persistence of vortex currents in the quantum mechanical systems. Therefore we conclude that the vortex\n\n\ftopological charge is not as robust quantity as it is commonly believed (see e. g. [14] and references therein, [16]).\nFinally, we would like to mention that appearance of vortices can happen in a way that does not violate the HKT.\nNamely, they can appear in the form of a closed vortex\nline that springs from a point or as a vortex-antivortex\npair creation from a node of a wave function [4].\nV. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nWe have analyzed the applicability of the HelmholtzKelvin theorem in the hydrodynamical formulation of the\nquantum mechanics. The velocity field of the probability\nfluid is defined as the gradient of the phase of the quantum wave function. This implies that nonzero circulation, along a given contour, may come out in the system\nif the field reveals a singularity at certain points on a\nsurface encircled by the contour. Adopting the HKT to\nthe quantum liquid may suggest that such a topological\ncharge of the system can not change.\nHowever, the HKT may be employed if a given contour\nevolves through points where the velocity field is well defined. It may happen even in classical hydrodynamics\nthat such an assumption is not fulfilled if, e.g., liquid\nencounters obstacles in the flow [9]. In quantum liquids\nthe situation is more complicated because a singularity\nis necessary for a nonzero circulation. Indeed, phase of a\nwave function is undefined at a vortex core, which means\nthat singularities appear in hydrodynamical formulation\nof quantum mechanics whenever vortices show up. This\nproperty makes distinction of hydrodynamical description of quantum system from the classical hydrodynamics. We have presented simple analytical examples where\nthe quantum evolution of a wave function pushes a contour to a singular point. Such a process is accompanied\nby a change of the vortex topological charge.\nWe have illustrated the violation of the HKT choosing examples that correspond to linear quantum systems.\nMacroscopic quantum behavior is present in interacting many particle systems that are usually described in\nthe mean field approximation by a nonlinear Schr\u00f6dinger\nequation. In Appendix we complete the analysis of the\nHKT for a nonlinear Schr\u00f6dinger evolution. Vortices\nmaybe also investigated in propagation of classical light\n[16,17]. Indeed, the evolution equation of the slowly varying envelope of a light beam can have identical form as\nthe Schr\u00f6dinger equation, which allows for exactly the\nsame considerations as we have presented above. The\ndynamics of vortices and escapes of the off-center vortex\nin an analog of the asymmetric harmonic potential have\nbeen experimentally observed in such systems [18].\nWe are grateful to J. Zakrzewski and G. Molina-Terriza\nfor fruitful discussion and to U. Fischer for the critical reading of the manuscript. Support of KBN under\nproject 5 P03B 088 21 is acknowledged.\n\nVI. APPENDIX: HELMHOLTZ-KELVIN\nTHEOREM FOR NONLINEAR SYSTEMS\n\nFor completeness we analyze here the application of the\nHKT in hydrodynamical formulation of nonlinear quantum mechanics. The so-called Gross-Pitaevskii equation is successfully used to describe the properties of a\nBose-Einstein condensate in trapped alkali atoms [8]. In\nparticular this equation exhibits various vortex solutions\n[11]. To make the discussion more general we will also\ninclude the mean field term describing a possible dipolar\ninteractions between condensed atoms [19]. The nonlinear Schr\u00f6dinger equation of interest reads\nih\u0304\n\n\u2202\nh\u03042 ~ 2\n\u2207 \u03a8(~r, t) + V (~r, t)\u03a8(~r, t)\n\u03a8(~r, t) = \u2212\n\u2202t\n2m\n\u0012Z\n\u0013\n3 \u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\n2\n+\nd r Vint (~r \u2212 ~r )|\u03a8(~r , t)| \u03a8(~r, t), (15)\n\nwhere Vint corresponds to two body interactions (e.g.\npoint or p\ndipolar interactions [8,19]).\nSubstitution\n\u03c1(~r, t) exp(i\u03c7(~r, t)) leads to the continuity\n\u03a8(~r, t) =\nequation (3) and the following dynamical equation for\nthe velocity field\n\u0012\nZ\n\u2202~v ~ 1\n+\u2207\nmv 2 + V + d3 r\u2032 Vint (~r \u2212 ~r\u2032 )\u03c1(~r\u2032 , t)\nm\n\u2202t\n2\n\u221a \u0013\n2\nh\u0304 \u22072 \u03c1\n\u2212\n= 0.\n(16)\n\u221a\n2m\n\u03c1\nThe only difference in comparison with Eq. (2) is the appearance of two new terms in the bracket of Eq. (16).\nThese terms, however, do not change the proof of the\nHKT - for example Eq. (6) does not possess any potential like terms. Therefore the Helmholtz-Kelvin theorem\nholds also for systems described by Eq. (15) under the\nsame assumptions as in the case of linear quantum mechanics discussed in Sec. III.\n\n[1] R. P.
