Gutierrez*\n\nTouro College, 27 West 23rd Street, New York, NY 10010\n*Electronic address: waltong@touro.edu\n\nA model is proposed to minimize the total volume of the main distribution networks\nof fluids in organs such as the kidney and the lung. A consequence of the\nminimization analysis is that the optimal overall form of the organs is a modified\nellipsoid. The variational procedure implementing this minimization is similar to the\nPREPRINT, May 2005\ntraditional isoperimetric theorems of geometry.\nNote: An expanded version of this article will be available sometime in Dec. of 2005,\ntaking a closer look at the fractal nature of the network.\n\nAt the allometric level there is similarity between the kidney and lung of mammals, when these\norgans are anatomically described in terms of the dimensions of their organ sites, such as the\nnephrons and alveoli [1-3].\nThe kidney and lung are notable for their capacity to process large amount of fluids in a small\norgan volume, thereby indicating that the distribution networks of fluids of these organs have a\ngeometric design of great efficiency. A basic requirement to achieve this efficiency is the\nminimization of the total volume of the network, so that a larger part of the volume of the organ is\navailable to the nephrons and alveoli where the actual processing of fluids is performed.\nComputer simulations of distribution networks of simplified box-like organs already show the\nlarge effect of the organ form in the total volume of an efficient distribution network [4].\nThe model developed here links geometric characteristics of distribution networks to main\nfeatures of organ anatomy: from the microscopic sites to the macroscopic overall form of the\norgan. The minimization of the network volume is subjected to several other requirements among\nwhich the following biophysical conditions are considered:\n(I). Total bulk volume of the organ, regardless of organ form.\n(II). Inlet and outlet features of the networks of the organ (ureter, main bronchus, etc).\n(III). Sharing of space among the organs within the thorax and abdomen and special anatomic\nfeatures needed to move materials through the organ, such as the diaphragm.\nIt will be shown that conditions (I) and (II), together with some elements of (III), are sufficient to\nderive an approximation to the kidney form and to the overall exterior form of both lungs above\nthe diaphragm. The kidney form is simpler in the sense that it is not as time dependent as the lung\nis during the breathing cycle. Since the total volume of a kidney is small, the kidney is only\npartially conditioned by (III). Therefore the kidney would be the first testing ground for the\nconcepts and techniques of the model. Naturally, a full accounting of condition (III) would\nrequire a very complex set of calculations, a goal that is outside the scope of this paper.\nA common use of variational techniques is found in the following classic isoperimetric theorem:\nfor a given volume value, the geometric form with the least area is the sphere, which is also the\nform containing the maximum volume for a given area. In this model it is similarly discovered\nthat the least network volume for a given organ volume is found in the modified ellipsoid organ\nform, which also corresponds to the maximum organ volume for a given network volume.\nThe model is based on the analysis of distribution networks with fractal characteristics presented\nin [2], where complete details and additional references on related issues are given. The initial\npoint of the model is a formula (Eq. (8) of [2]) for the calculation of the volume of a network of\nfluid distribution,\n\n1 of 5 pages\n\n\fVnet = (C01 FA A0 / V ) \u222b X (r ) dV \u2261 ( P / V ) I X\n\n(1)\n\nwhere: P = C01FAA0; C01 is a constant; FA is a function of other parameters of the network; A0 is\nthe cross section area of the main branch of the network such as the renal artery; V is the organ\nvolume; and IX is the integral over the organ volume region of the circulation distance function\n\u0425(r). This is the distance inside the network between the position r = (rx , ry , rz) of a site of the\norgan, such as a nephron, to the average inlet position of the network. In this model, it is assumed\nthat the most relevant effect of the organ form on the network volume is contributed by I\u0425 , which\nis the quantity to be minimized, while leaving P and V constant in this process.\nTo model circulatory organs such as the kidney and lung, we should consider the three main\nnetworks: the arterial, the venous, and the urine drainage in the kidney and the bronchial in the\nlung. Due to the similarities and geometric parallelism of the venous and arterial networks within\nthese organs, these two networks are summarized into a single network. In this modeling\napproximation, the organ contains two major networks: A and B. In the case of the kidney these\nare the urine drainage network (A) and the combined arterial and venous network (B). In the lung\na similar association is to have the bronchial network (A), and the blood network (B).\nThus by extending Eq. (1) to the total volume of network A and B,\n\nVnetAB = ( PA I XA + PB I XB ) / V\n\n(2)\n\nTo describe further the various network geometric functions a conventional spherical coordinate\nsystem is introduced, (r, \u03b8, \u03c6) = (r, \u03a9). The origin of the coordinate is placed at the origin of\nnetwork A and the origin of network B is placed at a position cB on the +rz axis (Fig. 1). The\ninlet/outlet connections of the organ are in the region of the \u2013rx axis. The circulation distance\nfunction XA(r, \u03b8, \u03c6) is in general given by (Eq. (7) of [2]), XA = fA1ru + fA2rv\u03c7A(\u03b8, \u03c6), where, fA1 >\n1, fA1 >> fA2 and similarly for XB. In [2] it is shown that the first term of XA and XB, with u = 1 (the\n\"Euclidean\" distance) is the dominant contribution, therefore this is the only term under\nconsideration in what follows. Then, XA = fA1r, and XB = fB1rB, where rB is the distance between\n(rx , ry , rz) and (0, 0, cB).\nThe region of integration for rx > 0 is exteriorly delimited by the organ form represented by the\nsurface R(\u03b8, \u03c6), (Fig. 1) which will be determined as a solution of the equation resulting from the\nminimization of the network volume. Going from rx > 0 to rx < 0 the region of integration near the\norigin of the networks (Fig. 1) can include a small region delimited by the Rin(\u03b8, \u03c6) surface\nneeded to provide space to connect the organ to the major (inlet or outlet) vessels of body\ncirculation (such as renal artery, vein and ureter). The function Rin is treated as a given surface\nthat is a boundary condition for R. In this way condition (II) listed in the introduction is\naccounted for. The union of Rin and R surfaces represent the whole organ form, and using them in\nEq. (2) the network volume is\nB\n\nB\n\nB\n\nB\n\nB\n\nB\n\nB\n\nVnetAB = V \u22121\n\nR (\u03a9)\n\n\u222b\u222b\n\n\u03a9 ' Rin ( \u03a9 )\n\n(QA r + QB rB )r 2 drd\u03a9 \u2261 V \u22121I ( R )\n\n(3)\n\nwhere, QA = PAfA1, QB = PBfB1, and d\u03a9 = sin\u03c6d\u03c6d\u03b8. A basic trigonometric application to the\ndistance rB shows that, rB(r, \u03c6) = (r2 + cB2 \u2013 2rcBcos\u03c6)1/2. Also using the same variables and\nfunctions the volume of the organ is\nB\n\nB\n\nV = V ( R) =\n\nB\n\nB\n\n\u222b\u222b\n\nB\n\nR (\u03a9)\n\nr 2 drd\u03a9\n\n\u03a9 ' Rin ( \u03a9 )\n\n(4)\n\n2 of 5 pages\n\n\fTo minimize the networks volume under the variations of the organ form R(\u03a9) the integral I(R)\n(Eq. (3)) is regarded as a functional of R(\u03a9). To incorporate condition (I) of the introduction, the\nminimization is done for a given value of the organ volume, Vo= V(R). A Lagrange multiplier \u03bb is\nintroduced to combine (3) and (4), and determine the extrema in relation to R of the auxiliary\nfunctional Vaux(R)\n\nVaux ( R ) = Vo\u22121 I ( R ) + \u03bb (Vo \u2212 V ( R )) \u2261\n\n\u222b\n\n\u03a9'\n\nFaux ( R )d\u03a9 + \u03bbVo\n\n(5)\n\nwhere Faux(R) is defined by (5). Since Faux(R) contains no derivatives of R, the problem is reduced\nto equating to zero the partial derivative of Faux(R) in relation to R, which determines the\nfollowing equation for R,\n\n\u2202Faux / \u2202R = [(Q A R + QB rB ( R, \u03c6 )) / Vo \u2212 \u03bb ]R 2 = 0\n\n(6)\n\nThe analogy to the isoperimetric theorems is established as follows. If we seek the largest organ\nvolume for a given network volume, VABo = VnetAB, then from Eq. (3), V(R) = I(R)/VABo . This last\nequation is combined with Eq. (4) with the help of a new Lagrange's multiplier \u03bb' in order to\nestablish a new auxiliary functional, V 'aux ( R ) = V ( R ) + \u03bb '[( I ( R ) / VABo ) \u2212 V ( R )] , which has an\nextrema in relation to R determined by the same Eq. (6), with the identification,\nVo \u03bb = VABo(\u03bb' \u2013 1)/\u03bb'.\nEq. (6) is a simple quadratic equation for R. The solution formula with the square root in the\ndenominator is chosen. Rewriting Eq. (6) as, aR2 + 2bR \u2013 2c = 0, then,\nR(\u03c6 ) = 2c /{b \u00b1 [b 2 + 2ac]1 / 2 } , where the extra factors of 2 are introduced to avoid a later\ntedious redefinition of parameters. In this case, a = (QB2 \u2013 QA2)/ \u03bbQAVo = (ec/cB) \u2013 (1/cL); b = 1 \u2013\neccos\u03c6, and c = (cL \u2013 eccB)/2, where the new parameters are, cL = \u03bbVo/QA and ec = cBQB2/\u03bbQAVo.\nNotice that the four original positive parameters QA, QB, Vo, cB, together with \u03bb are reduced to the\nthree effective parameters for R(\u03c6) which are cB, cL, and ec. In terms of dimensional analysis, it\nturns out that cL is a length and ec is dimensionless, because initially, \u03bb is dimensionless, cB is a\nlength and QA, QB have dimension of area. The range of variation of some of these parameters is\nrestricted, as is discussed below. Writing the solution in a more explicit form\nB\n\nB\n\nB\n\nB\n\nB\n\nB\n\nB\n\nB\n\nB\n\nR (\u03c6 ) = 2c /{1 \u2212 ec cos \u03c6 + [(1 \u2212 ec cos \u03c6 ) 2 + g e ]1/ 2 }\n\n(7)\n\nwhere, g e \u2261 2ac = \u2212[ec \u2212 (cL / cB )][ec \u2212 (cB / cL )] . This solution has axial symmetry (rz axis),\nbut the imposition of the boundary condition with the Rin(\u03b8, \u03c6) surface would in general break the\naxial symmetry of the final solution.\nIn Eq. (7) the + root has been chosen, to allow the important particular case, ge = 0 to be well\ndefined, and continuous with ge \u2260 0. When ge = 0 the solution (7) is an ellipsoid with eccentricity\nec, and the main axis on the rz axis. This would require that 0 \u2264 ec < 1, and c > 0 (or cL/cB > ec).\nThe case ge = 0, correspond to two networks with the same volume characteristic, though not\nidentical networks.\nWhen ge \u2260 0, the solution is a modified ellipsoid similar to an egg form (Fig. 2) which is named\nhere as the g-ellipsoid (no previous identification of this surface was found). The g-ellipsoid is\nmade by rotating the g-ellipse around the rz axis. The parameter, ge = 2ac > \u2013(1\u2013 ec)2, makes the\nsquare root of the denominator of Eq. (7) always well defined.\nThe original meaning of ec as the eccentricity is formally lost when ge \u2260 0. In fact for ec > 1, still\nthere is a g-ellipse (ge > 0) that becomes closer to a circle as ec becomes larger, as shown in Fig 2\nB\n\n3 of 5 pages\n\n\fmost exterior curve. However, many g-ellipses are close to a single ellipse, especially when ge is\nsmall (Fig. 2). A much better approximation of the g-ellipse can be obtained with two different\nellipses along the rz axis. In Fig. 2. the most interior ellipse of the illustration follows a g-ellipse\n(ge = \u20130.109) very closely for rz < 1, similarly another half ellipse of larger eccentricity closely\nfollows the other side of this g-ellipse (rz > 1.2). This double ellipse approximation simplifies a\ngreat deal the applications of the g-ellipse discussed below. In this approximation the g-ellipse\nbecomes a \"natural interpolation\" of two half ellipses of similar minor diameter with different\nmajor diameter.\nTo have a model for R(\u03b8, \u03c6) even closer to real organ forms some elements from condition (III)\nmust be included. The first basic element to consider is the asymmetric restrictions on the\navailable space to the organ along the x, y, and z directions. We can incorporate this into the\narguments leading to Eq. (7) by considering only an angular slice, between \u03b8 and \u03b8 + \u0394\u03b8, of the\ntotal organ volume as the region of integration. Then the parameters \u03bb and Vo are replaced by\nfunctions of \u03b8. The new solution for R is still given by Eq. (7), with new parameters c, ec and ge\nwhich are functions of \u03b8, which in turn depend on the way the additional boundary conditions are\nimposed. This last argument shows that a more complete solution for R can be found within a\nlarger family of surfaces generated by g-ellipses. Such solution is constructed by a more general\ng-ellipsoid that has, in the double ellipsoid approximation, different eccentricities along the x, y, z\ndirections. Such surface is here called the g3-ellipsoid.\nThe use of the g3-ellipsoid and ellipsoid in modeling the kidney and the overall exterior form of\nboth lungs is shown in Fig. 3 and 4. The fitness of the g-ellipse can be seen by looking at the\ncross sections and the two-dimensional projections of the organ forms. Other exterior views of\nthe kidney that are not shown, display a similar fitness to the g-ellipse, as shown in Fig. 3. These\nillustrations are not intended as rigorous evaluations, rather as examples of possible applications\nof the model developed so far. No statistical analysis of these results has been attempted, an issue\nthat by itself would require some theoretical development. Choosing from organ images as close\nto reality as possible, a selection was made on the basis of the overall visual clarity of the final\npicture. There is plenty of medical imaging of the lung of normal human subjects, where the type\nof curve fitting shown in Fig. 4 is a very common result, but it is still a better illustration a\ntraditional anatomical drawing, as is shown. Fig. 4 suggests that the exterior form of both lungs\nfollow a single optimal organ design given by a section of an ellipsoid (or g3-ellipsoid). It would\nbe of great interest to elaborate further this description of the lungs at the various stages of the\nbreathing cycle.\nAn important and arduous task is the modeling of the surface Rin(\u03b8, \u03c6) and its detailed relation to\nthe g3-ellipsoid. This is a first step towards a more complete inclusion of condition (III).\nThese, and many other modeling issues about the organs are now available to quantitative\nanalysis through the possible applications and extensions of this model.\nREFERENCES\n[1] J.
