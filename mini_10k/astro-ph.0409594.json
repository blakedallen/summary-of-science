The\nanalysis is conducted both in the synchronous and in the conformally Newtonian gauges.\nThe cosmological plasma is assumed to be composed of cold dark mattter, baryons, photons, neutrinos. The problem of super-horizon initial conditions for the fluid variables\nof the various species and for the coupled system of Boltzmann-Einstein equations is\ndiscussed in the presence of an inhomogeneous magnetic field. The tight coupling approximation for the Boltzmann hierarchy is extended to the case where gravitating\nmagnetic fields are included.\n\n\f1\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe impact of magnetic fields on the anisotropies of the Cosmic Microwave Background\n(CMB) has been a subject of active investigation since the early attempts of Zeldovich\n[1, 2], where it was proposed that all the anisotropy in the CMB could be generated by a\nmagnetic field. Following the development of inflationary cosmology it is now clear that\nthe explanation of the large-scale temperature anisotropies should be attributed to some\nadiabatic (or quasi-adiabatic) mode, which was present outside the horizon prior to the\ndecoupling of radiation from matter.\nThe theory of scalar gravitational fluctuations is a well developed subject and it is an\nessential tool setting the initial conditions for the evolution of CMB anisotropies. When\ninitial conditions are set, usually deep within the radiation era (but after neutrino decoupling taking place around 1 MeV), the dominant component of the plasma are photons and\n(effectively massless) neutrinos. The subdominant component of the plasma is formed by\nbaryons, electrons, cold dark matter (CDM) particles. CDM particles are only coupled to\ngravitational interactions and behave like a perfect relativistic fluid. Also the photons, leptons and baryons, being tightly coupled through Thompson scattering, behave like perfect\nrelativistic fluids. On the contrary, neutrinos are essentially collisionless and, therefore, do\nnot really behave like a perfect fluid. Because of this physical difference, neutrinos should\nbe described through the appropriate Boltzmann hierarchy of their phase-space distribution. If the dark energy is paramertized in terms of a cosmological term, the gravitational\nfluctuations of this sector do not affect the problem of the initial conditions.\nIf primordial fluctuations of the geometry are present outside the horizon before matterradiation equality, they imprint also fluctuations in the density contrasts and peculiar velocities of the different species. The quantitative evolution of the various plasma quantities\nis determined by the fluctuations of the geometry by solving the coupled system of Einstein and fluid equations in the radiation-dominated epoch when the relevant modes are\nstill outside the horizon. Following the classification scheme pioneered by Bardeen [3], the\ninitial conditions may be classified into adiabatic or isocurvature modes. In the adiabatic\ncase the total fluctuations in the entropy density of the CDM\u2013photon\u2013lepton\u2013baryon fluid\nvanish at large distance scales which is compatible with a constant mode of curvature fluctuations outside the horizon. In the case of isocurvature modes, in the usual terminology,\nthe fluctuations in the entropy density do not vanish; according to the linear analysis of\nthe Einstein-fluid system, this is compatible, in some cases, with non-constant modes of\nthe curvature fluctuations. In spite of this simplified classification, the situation may be\nmore complicated since different isocurvature modes may be allowed for the different species\npresent in the plasma. Moreover, it is also quite plausible to have a situation where the initial conditions are, predominantly, of adiabatic nature, but with a subdominant isocurvature\ncomponent.\nAlthough an excellent approximation early on, the tight-coupling assumption breaks\n1\n\n\fdown at later times, when photons and baryons decouple. In spite of this caveat, a systematic use of the tight-coupling expansion allows important analytical estimates of the\nproduced CMB anisotropies [4].\nIn the theory of the CMB anisotropies, the problem of initial conditions is often presented\nin two complementary descriptions, namely the conformally Newtonian and the synchronous\ngauges. Both gauges are quite useful for different reasons (see also [6]). The conformally\nNewtonian gauge (often dubbed longitudinal) is effective in the discussion of the evolution\nof the fluctuations while they are still outside the horizon. However, in such a gauge, the\ndiscussion of the initial conditions for the CMB anisotropies may be rather complicated. For\ninstance, there are physical isocurvature modes that are singular in the longitudinal gauge\nbut not in the synchronous gauge. Furthermore, various codes needed for the numerical\ncalculations of the CMB spectra are formulated within the synchronous coordinate system.\nThere have been, in the past, controversies concerning the use of the synchronous gauge\n[5]. The main caveat was that gauge modes may appear in the synchronous gauge. These\ngauge modes, however, can be precisely disentangled from the physical ones [5], so that a\npragmatic approach envisaged some time ago [6] has been to discuss the problem of initial\nconditions in both gauges in parallel.\nSuppose now that inhomogeneous magnetic fields are present. In this case two major\neffects can be envisaged:\n\u2022 inhomogeneous magnetic fields can gravitate, i.e. they can affect the perturbed Einstein equations, thus becoming sources of the fluctuations of the geometry;\n\u2022 inhomogeneous magnetic fields can impart different velocity gradients to the baryon\u2013\nphoton\u2013lepton fluid, but not to the neutrinos and to the CDM components.\nDeep within the radiation epoch, large-scale magnetic fields can be treated, in first approximation, as interacting with a single globally neutral fluid. In fact the two electrically\ncharged species present in the problem are the electrons and the baryons which are in thermal equlibrium at a common temperature. The typical length scales of interest for the\npresent discussion are the ones much larger than the typical magnetic diffusivity scale (set\nby the finite value of the conductivity) and also much larger than the Silk damping scale\n(set by the finite value of the thermal diffusivity scale). Furthermore, for this range of\nscales we are not interested in the propagation of high frequency electromagnetic waves\nwhose specific analysis would clearly require a two-fluid plasma treatment. The one-fluid\nplasma description if often dubbed as magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). In MHD, the current density, the magnetic field and the electric field are all solenoidal and the Lorentz force\naffecting the baryon peculiar velocity modifies the standard tight-coupling approximation.\nBy looking at the evolution of the brightness of the temperature fluctuations it is rather\nclear that, to zeroth order in the tight-coupling expansion, the monopole and dipole equations are modified. It is known [4] that to zeroth order in the tight coupling expansion\n2\n\n\fthe CMB is not linearly polarized since, to this order, photons and baryons are so strongly\ncoupled that the photon distribution is isotropic in the baryon rest frame. The photon distribution being isotropic, Thompson scattering does not polarize the CMB. To first order in\nthe tight-coupling expansion the polarization of the CMB is proportional to the quadrupole\nof the photon distribution. The quadrupole in the temperature fluctuations is, in turn,\nproduced by the free streaming of the dipole between collisions. If a Lorentz force term is\npresent, the evolution of the monopole acquires a further source term and, as a consequence,\nall the higher orders in the tight coupling expansion are modified.\nVarious analyses of the possible impact of magnetic fields on standard CMB physics1\nhave been proposed up to now (see, for instance, [7] for a short review on this specific\nsubject). In [8] the analysis of scalar fluctuations of the geometry is made under the\nassumption that the Lorentz force vanishes. In MHD this assumption translates into a\nspecific class of magnetic field configurations. However, even in the case of a force-free\nconfiguration the specific initial conditions used by the authors in order to compute the\nCMB anisotropies are not specifically discussed, i.e. no solution for super-horizon sized\nfluctuations including large-scale magnetic fields, is presented. Furthermore, no specific\ninvestigation of the impact of gravitating magnetic fields on the tight-coupling expansion\nhas been attempted. In [9] an interesting analysis of the impact of large-scale magnetic\nfields on CMB anisotropies has been performed, mainly for the vector and tensor modes of\nthe geometry. The scalar fluctuations have not been discussed. In [10] attention is always\npaid to vector and tensor modes and the problem of initial conditions is more accurately\nspecified. It is clear that without a precise specification of the initial conditions for the\nCMB anisotropies the numerical analysis is rather difficult to implement since it is unclear\nwhat should be, for instance, the initial values of the lowest multipoles of the phase-space\ndistribution for the various species. The need of an accurate analysis of the problem of initial\nconditions can be also understood by observing that the system of perturbed equations, even\nif linear, has many unknowns so different solutions, describing different physical situation\nmay be possible.\nThe effect of large-scale magnetic fields on CMB anisotropies may also be discussed in\nthe case when the magnetic field is not completely inhomogeneous. There could be situations\nin which there is an homogeneous component of the magnetic field (for instance along the\n\u1e91 axis. This case is similar to the one originally investigated in [1, 2]. In this framework\nbounds on such a magnetic field can be derived [11]. It could also happen that the uniform\nmagnetic field supports inhomogeneities in the bulk velocity field affecting, consequently,\nthe CMB anisotropies. One example in this direction are the Alfv\u00e9n waves, whose effects\nand implications have been analysed under different approximations by various authors\n[12, 13, 14, 15]. The simplification of having a uniform magnetic field also allowed the\nanalysis of possible Faraday rotation effect of the CMB polarization plane [16, 17, 18, 19].\n1\n\nBy standard CMB physics we mean that a constant mode of adiabatic (or quasi-adiabatic) fluctuations\nis assumed to be present outside the horizon prior to equality.\n\n3\n\n\fThe motivation for including a uniform magnetic field relies on the simplicity of the\nconfiguration. However, the magnetic fields produced in the early Universe, as far as we\nunderstand the problem, are unlikely to be produced in a perfectly uniform configuration.\nThey are most likely to be produced either from the amplification of vacuum fluctuations\nof some primordial gauge field or from some phase transitions. In all these cases magnetic\nfields are expected to be fully inhomogeneous (see, for instance, [21] for a recent review on\nthe r\u00f4le of large-scale magnetic fields in cosmology and astrophysics).\nThe purpose of the present study is to give a systematic analysis of the theory of scalar\ngravitational fluctuations in the presence of a fully inhomogeneous magnetic field and in the\ncontext of the conventional Bardeen formalism. This analysis is mandatory both to derive\naccurate bounds on large-scale magnetic fields from CMB physics and to bring the study\nof magnetized initial conditions to the same standard as in the non-magnetized case. To\nthe best of our knowledge this problem did not receive specific attention in the literature\nconcerning the linearized theory of scalar fluctuations in the presence of magnetic fields. The\nresults reported in the present paper are general in the sense that no specific configuration\nof the magnetic field is assumed. The only assumption, as previously stressed, is that the\nmagnetic field is fully inhomogeneous.\nIt is important to mention that various studies discussing the evolution of large-scale\nmagnetic field exist in the covariant approach which is somehow complementary to the one\nadopted in the present paper. For a full discussion of the problem see [22, 23] and references\ntherein.\nThe plan of the present paper is the following. In Section 2 the evolution equations\nfor gravitating inhomogeneous magnetic fields will be derived in the MHD approximation\nand in the context of the conformally Newtonian gauge. In Section 3 the initial conditions\nfor the CMB anisotropies will be analysed. Solutions for super-horizon-sized fluctuations\nwill be presented in different cases. Section 4 is devoted to the analysis of the synchronous\ngauge description. In Section 5 the tight-coupling expansion will be revisited in the presence\nof inhomogeneous magnetic fields. Section 6 contains some concluding remarks. Various\nuseful technical results have been collected in the appendix even though, in some cases, they\nwere already present in the literature, but within a different set of conventions or within a\ndifferent context.\n\n2\n\nGravitating inhomogeneous magnetic fields\n\nThe treatment of magnetic fields in a globally neutral plasma differs considerably according\nto the specific range of scales relevant for the problem under discussion. For instance, the\nelectromagnetic branch of the spectrum of plasma excitations, in a cold or warm magnetized\nplasma, can only be partially addressed within a two-fluid description [24, 25]. Partially\nmeans, in the present context, that the dispersion relations can be obtained but the typical\n4\n\n\fdamping scales require the solution of the full kinetic system of equations for the different\nspecies (the so-called Vlasov\u2013Landau approach).\nThe phenomena occurring over much smaller frequencies and over large length scales can\nbe described on the basis of our knowledge of terrestrial plasma, by an appropriate one-fluid\ndescription, which is provided by MHD [26]. The main idea behind the MHD approximation\nis, in short, the following. Starting from a two-fluid description (for instance electron and\nbaryon fluids) it is possible to define appropriate one-fluid variables. For instance the bulk\nvelocity of the plasma appearing in the MHD description is, in flat space-time,\n~v =\n\nmb~vb + me~ve\n.\nmb + me\n\n(2.1)\n\nwhich is, in practice, the centre-of-mass velocity of the baryon\u2013electron system. In the specific case touched by the present discussion, both baryons and electrons are non-relativistic\nand in thermal equilibrium Teb .\nThe reduced MHD description [26] has been employed in the analysis of different problems arising in connection with large-scale magnetic fields. For instance, the evolution of\nthese fields in curved space-times is normally discussed within a MHD approach [27, 28, 29]\n(see also for a review [30, 31]). More formal discussions on MHD and on two-fluid descriptions in curved space-times can be found in [32, 33, 34]. Finally, the reduced MHD\ndescription has been used in the analysis of the implications of large-scale magnetic fields\non structure formation [35, 36].\n\n2.1\n\nThe perturbed system of Einstein equations\n\nConsider now the Friedmann\u2013Robertson\u2013Walker (FRW) line element written in the conformally flat case\nds2 = a2 (\u03b7)[d\u03b7 2 \u2212 d~x2 ],\n(2.2)\nwhere \u03b7 is the conformal time coordinate.

This procedure is rather tricky and, in principle other terms\nmay appear in the generalized Ohm law such as the thermoelectric term and the Hall term\n[24, 21]. These will be neglected here. Finally, as pointed out after Eq. (2.1), the bulk\nvelocity field appearing in Eq. (2.24) can be identified with the velocity of the baryons.\nThe evolution for the baryon velocity field can be derived by perturbing the covariant\nconservation equation (including the appropriate electromagnetic contribution), i.e.\n\u03bc\u03b1\n\n\u03bd\n\n\u03b2\u03bd\n\n\u03bc\n\n\u2202\u03bc \u03b4Tb\u03bc\u03bd + \u03b4\u0393\u03bd\u03bc\u03b1 T b + +\u0393\u03bc\u03b1 \u03b4Tb\u03bc\u03b1 + \u03b4\u0393\u03bc\u03b2\u03bc T b + \u0393\u03b2\u03bc \u03b4Tb\u03b2\u03bd \u2212 F \u03bd\u03b1 j\u03b1 = 0,\n\u03bc\u03bd\n\n(2.25)\n\nwhere T b and \u03b4Tb\u03bc\u03bd are, respectively, the energy-momentum of the baryons and its firstorder fluctuation; F \u03bd\u03b1 is the Maxwell field strength and j\u03b1 is the current density. An\n7\n\n\fanalogous notation is used for the Christoffel symbols computed on the background (denoted\n~ vb , the evolution\nby an overline) and for their first-order fluctuations. Thus, defining \u03b8b = \u2207*~\nequation for the peculiar velocity of the baryons and for the density contrast reads:\n\u03b8b\u2032 = \u2212H\u03b8b \u2212 c2s \u22072 \u03b4b \u2212 \u22072 \u03c6 +\n\n~ * [J~ \u00d7 B]\n~\n4 \u03a9\u03b3\n\u2207\nane xe \u03c3T (\u03b8\u03b3 \u2212 \u03b8b ) +\n,\n4\n3 \u03a9b\na \u03c1b\n\n\u03b4b\u2032 = 3\u03c8 \u2032 \u2212 \u03b8b .\n\n(2.26)\n(2.27)\n\nwhere xe is the ionization fraction of the plasma, \u03c3T the Thompson cross section; \u03a9\u03b3 \u03a9b\nare, respectively, the energy densities, in critical units, for photons and baryons. At this\npoint we can also define the differential optical depth for Thompson scattering:\n\u03c4 \u2032 = xe ne \u03c3T a(\u03b7).\n\n(2.28)\n\nEquations (2.20)\u2013(2.23), together with Eqs. (2.24) and (2.26), can be studied in the\nMHD approximation. Since the plasma is globally neutral (\u03c1q \u2243 0), the charge density of\nthe electrons will be exactly compensated by the baryons and, according to Eq. (2.22), the\nelectric field will be solenoidal. Moreover, for sufficiently small frequencies, the displacement\ncurrent can be neglected in Eq. (2.21). This implies that also the Ohmic current will be\nsolenoidal, i.e.\n~ \u00d7 B.\n~\n~ * J~ = 0, J~ = 1 \u2207\n(2.29)\n\u2207\n4\u03c0\nAs a result, the Ohmic electric field vanishes exactly in the limit of vanishing conductivity,\ni.e. since\n~\n~\n~\n~ \u223c J = \u2207\u00d7 B,\n(2.30)\nE\n\u03c3\n\u03c3\nthe electric fields appearing in Eqs. (2.11) and (2.13) lead to a contribution that is suppressed as 1/\u03c3 2 . Similarly, the electric field appearing in Eq. (2.12) leads to a contribution\nthat is suppressed as 1/\u03c3.\nRecalling, as previously defined, that \u03c3 = \u03c3c a, for temperatures T < 1 MeV the conductivity can be expressed as [24, 21]\n\u03c3c \u2243\n\n1 Teb\n\u03b1em me\n\u0012\n\n\u00131/2\n\n,\n\n(2.31)\n\nwhere Teb , as previously defined, is the common temperature of electrons and baryons. The\nfinite value of the conductivity sets a typical diffusion scale for the evolution of the magnetic\nfields which is typically of the order of\nL\u03c3 (T ) =\n\n\u22121/2 1/4 \u0012\nTeb\ng\u2217\n\n\u03c30\n\n72.2\n\nMP\n\n\u00131/2 \u0012\n\nTeb\nme\n\n\u0013\u22121/4\n\nLH (T ),\n\n(2.32)\n\nwhere L\u03c3 is the physical diffusion scale, LH \u2243 H \u22121 is the Hubble radius and g\u2217 the number\nof relativistic degrees of freedom. Since, in our problem eV < Teb < MeV, L\u03c3 \u226a LH which\n8\n\n\fmeans that the finite value of the conductivity only affects scales which are much smaller\nthan the Hubble radius.\nSimilar, but quantitatively different, remarks can be made for the thermal diffusivity\n[21]. For temperature smaller than the temperature of neutrino decoupling, photons are the\nmost efficient source of momentum transfer and the thermal diffusivity scale can be written\nas\n\u0012\n\u00131/4 s\n(\u03b3)\n2 \u0013\u22121/2 \u0012 x \u0013\u22121/2 \u0012 g\nLdiff (T )\nMeV\ne\n\u2217\n\u22125 \u03a9b h0\n\u2243 1.03 \u00d7 10\n,\n(2.33)\nLH (T )\n0.02\n0.5\n10.75\nTeb\nwhere, according to previous definitions (see Eq.

In fact neutrinos at early times after neutrino decoupling (occurring around\n1 MeV) obey the collisionless Boltzmann equation (see the appendix for a more detailed\ndiscussion). To describe neutrinos during and after horizon crossing requires a Boltzmann\nhierarchy for \u03b4\u03bd , \u03b8\u03bd and for the higher multipole moments, i.e. l \u2265 2, of the neutrino phasespace density F\u03bdl . With this caveat in mind, after neutrino decoupling, at temperatures of\nabout 1 MeV, massless neutrinos obey, in Fourier space, the following set of equations (see\nthe appendix for a swift derivation within the metric conventions adopted in Eqs. (2.2) and\n(2.6))\n4\n\u03b4\u03bd\u2032 = \u2212 \u03b8\u03bd + 4\u03c8 \u2032 ,\n3\n2\nk\n\u03b8\u03bd\u2032 = \u03b4\u03bd \u2212 k2 \u03c3\u03bd + k2 \u03c6,\n4\n4\n3\n\u2032\n\u03c3\u03bd =\n\u03b8\u03bd \u2212 kF\u03bd3 ,\n15\n10\n\n(2.36)\n(2.37)\n(2.38)\n\nwhere \u03c3\u03bd = F\u03bd2 /2 is the quadrupole moment of the (perturbed) neutrino phase-space\ndistribution and, as introduced above, F\u03bdl is the l-th multipole.\n9\n\n\fThe photon and neutrino evolution equations differ in the presence of an anisotropic\nstress term \u03c3\u03bd . Because of their frequent scattering by charged leptons and baryons, photons\nare unable, at early times, to develop a quadrupole moment in their velocity distribution.\nAs a consequence, when a mode enters the horizon, the photons behave as a perfect fluid,\nwhile the neutrinos free stream, creating inhomogeneities in the energy density, pressure and\nmomentum density. This is the physical reason why the anisotropic stress term appearing\nin Eq. (2.15) is effectively dominated, at early times, by the neutrino contribution. Also\nfor the photons it is more appropriate to discuss the full Boltzmann hierarchy, especially in\nthe light of the subsequent analysis of the tight-coupling approximation. This analysis will\nbe summarized in the appendix. In the fluid approximation the evolution equations of the\nphotons are given by the covariant conservation of the energy-momentum tensor, i.e.\n4\n\u03b4\u03b3\u2032 = \u2212 \u03b8\u03b3 + 4\u03c8 \u2032 ,\n3\n2\nk\n\u03b8\u03b3\u2032 = \u03b4\u03b3 + k2 \u03c6 + ane \u03c3T (\u03b8b \u2212 \u03b8\u03b3 ).\n4\n\n(2.39)\n(2.40)\n\nAt early times the characteristic time for the synchronization of the photon and baryon\nvelocities is \u03c4b\u03b3 \u223c (ne \u03c3T )\u22121 , which is small with respect to the expansion time and to the\noscillation period. Thus the tight-coupling between photons and baryons means that, in the\nfirst approximation, \u03c3T \u2192 \u221e and \u03b8\u03b3 \u2243 \u03b8b . A more detailed analysis of the tight coupling\nexpansion is postponed to Section 5.\n\n3\n\nLarge-scale solutions\n\nThe full system of scalar fluctuations in the longitudinal gauge will now be consistently\ndiscussed and solved. From Eq. (2.8) we obtain, in Fourier space2 and using Eq. (2.3):\n3\n\u22123H(H\u03c6 + \u03c8 \u2032 ) \u2212 k2 \u03c8 = H2 [(R\u03bd \u03b4\u03bd + (1 \u2212 R\u03bd )\u03b4\u03b3 ) + \u03a9B (k) + \u03a9b \u03b4b + \u03a9c \u03b4c ],\n2\n\n(3.1)\n\nwhere, for N\u03bd species of massless neutrinos,\nR=\n\n4\n7\nN\u03bd\n8\n11\n\u0012\n\n\u00134/3\n\n,\n\nR\u03bd =\n\nR\n,\n1+R\n\nR\u03b3 = 1 \u2212 R\u03bd ,\n\n(3.2)\n\nso that R\u03bd and R\u03b3 represent the fractional contributions of photons and neutrinos to the\ntotal density at early times deep within the radiation-dominated epoch.\nIn Eq. (3.1) the contribution of the magnetic energy density has been parametrized, in\nFourier space, as\n\u03c1B\n1\n\u03a9B (k, \u03b7) =\n=\n\u03c1\n8\u03c0\u03c1a4\n2\n\nZ\n\nd3 p Bi (|~\np \u2212 ~k|) B i (p).\n\n(3.3)\n\nIn order to avoid possible confusions with subscripts referring to the different species of the plasma we\nwill avoid to introducing a further subscript labelling the Fourier mode.\n\n10\n\n\fThe appearance of convolutions in the expressions of the magnetic energy density is a\ndirect consequence of the absence of a uniform component of the magnetic field whose\nbackground contribution, as repeatedly stressed, is vanishing. Notice also that \u03c1 appearing\nin Eq. (3.3) is the energy density of the dominant component of the fluid, so, for instance,\nin the radiation-dominated epoch \u03c1 \u2261 \u03c1r , a4 \u03c1r \u223c constant and \u03a9B \u2243 constant.\nFrom Eq.

This occurrence is not general: it will be shown in a moment that, even in the ideal\nMHD limit, the generalized Lorentz force does contribute both to the baryon evolution\nequation and to the anisotropic stress. In fact the evolution equation for the baryons\nbecomes, in Fourier space and with the conventions used so far\n\u03b8b\u2032 + H\u03b8b = k2 \u03c6 +\n\nFB (k)\n.\n4\u03c0a4 \u03c1b\n\n(3.8)\n\nBy taking the trace of Eq.

Different sorts of initial conditions are,\nin principle, possible. An interesting situation arises when both \u03c8 and \u03c6 are, in the first\napproximation, constant outside the horizon during the radiation-dominated epoch. In this\ncase, and in the absence of magnetic fields, it is known that the system of scalar metric\nperturbations admits an adiabatic mode. Adiabatic means, in the present context, that the\ntotal fluctuations in the entropy density of the CDM\u2013baryon\u2013radiation fluid vanish at large\nlength scales. This condition implies specific relations between the various density contrasts\ndeep within the radiation-dominated epoch, i.e.\n3\n3\n\u03b4c \u2243 \u03b4b \u2243 \u03b4\u03bd \u2243 \u03b4\u03b3 .\n4\n4\n\n(3.15)\n\nIn the following, after reviewing the specific analytic form of the adiabatic solution, new\nsolutions, arising in the presence of an inhomogeneous magnetic field, will be illustrated.\n\n12\n\n\f3.1\n\nThe standard adiabatic scenario\n\nIf the magnetic fields are absent, i.e. FB = \u03a9B = 0 the standard system of equations is\nrecovered and the initial conditions for the various fields can be found by solving, simultaneously, the baryon\u2013photon system (i.e. Eqs.

(3.44).\nSince the adiabaticity condition is only realized to lowest order in k\u03b7 it is legitimate to name\nthe solution presented in Eqs. (3.48)\u2013(3.55) quasi-adiabatic. The corrections to adiabaticity\nare of order \u03a9B k2 \u03b7 2 , so they are suppressed outside the horizon and also, by virtue of Eq.\n(3.7), by \u03a9B . Notice that three regimes emerge naturally. The quasi- adiabatic regime where\n\u03a9B (k) \u2264 \u03c60 (k), the isocurvature regime \u03a9B (k) > \u03c60 (k) and the fully adiabatic regime, i.e.\n\u03a9B (k) \u226a \u03c60 (k).\nThe force-free limit may be (approximately) realized in nature in some specific (but\nrather interesting) cases. For instance, it could happen that magnetic fields are generated\nin a so-called maximally helical configuration. Recall, in fact, that given a magnetic field\nconfiguration, in a MHD description, it is always possible to define the related magnetic\nhelicity [26], which is\nZ\n~ * B.\n~\nd3 xA\n(3.56)\nNow, at finite conductivity, the evolution of the magnetic helicity can be written as\nd\nd\u03b7\n\nZ\n\n~ *B\n~ =\u2212 1\nd xA\n4\u03c0\u03c3\n3\n\nZ\n\n~ *\u2207\n~ \u00d7 B,\n~\nd3 xB\n\n(3.57)\n\nwhere the expression appearing in the right-hand side is called magnetic gyrotropy [26] and\nmeasures the number of contact points in the magnetic field lines. Clearly, if the magnetic\n~ \u00d7B\n~ \u00d7B\n~ ,\ngyrotropy is maximal, the orthogonal combination, namely the Lorentz force \u2207\nwill be minimal or even zero. Maximally helical configurations can be very relevant in the\ndevelopment of MHD turbulence [26] and have been extensively studied in a cosmological\ncontext. (see also [21] for a general discussion and [38] for a recent paper). In particular it\nshould be noticed that helical configurations can be produced at the electroweak time by\ncoupling the hypercharge field to a pseudo-scalar [39] (see also [40]).\n\n17\n\n\f3.3\n\nContribution of the Lorentz force\n\nConsider now the case when the magnetic field is not force-free. The major difference with\nthe force-free case is that the evolution equation for the peculiar velocity of the baryons\nreceives a contribution from the magnetic field gradient. Because of the tightly coupled\ndynamics of baryons and photons, also the photon peculiar velocity will be modified. Since\nphotons are related to neutrinos by the Einstein equations, the whole solution will be\nmodified.\nEquation (2.26) can be written, after multiplying both sides by the scale factor a(\u03b7), as\n(a\u03b8b )\u2032 = k2 \u03c60 a +\n\nFB\n,\n4\u03c0\u03c1b a3\n\n(3.58)\n\nwhere it has been assumed that \u03c6 has, to lowest order, a constant solution denoted, as\nusual, by \u03c60 . The second term in the right-hand side of Eq. (3.58) is then constant and\ndirect integration gives\n\u03c60 2\nFB\n\u03b8b =\nk \u03b7+\n.\n(3.59)\n2\n4\u03c0\u03c1b a3\nFrom Eq. (2.27), using Eq. (3.59), the density contrast can be determined up to a constant,\nwhich is fixed from the adiabaticity condition:\n3\nFB\n3\n\u03b7.\n\u03b4b = \u2212 \u03c60 \u2212 \u03a9B \u2212\n2\n4\n4\u03c0\u03c1b a3\n\n(3.60)\n\nThe Hamiltonian constraint of Eq. (3.1) and the equation for the peculiar velocity of the\nphotons imply\n\u03b4\u03bd \u2243 \u03b4\u03b3 \u2243 \u22122\u03c60 \u2212 \u03a9B ,\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u03c60 \u03a9B 2\n\u03b8\u03b3 =\n\u2212\nk \u03b7.\n2\n4\n\n(3.61)\n(3.62)\n\nThe CDM equations (2.34) and (2.35) will then turn out to be\n\u03b4c \u2243 \u22122\u03c60 , \u03b8c =\n\n\u03c60 2\nk \u03b7.\n2\n\n(3.63)\n\nThe anisotropic stress of the neutrinos can be determined by solving Eq.

As a consequence [41], in the longitudinal gauge the\nmetric fluctuations correspond directly to a particular set of gauge-invariant combinations,\nnamely the Bardeen potentials [3]. Having said this, it is important to appreciate that\nlongitudinal and synchronous descriptions should be regarded as complementary and not as\nopposite. The synchronous description, for instance, is more convenient when modes based\non anisotropic stresses are discussed, as in the case of the present analysis. Furthermore, the\nknown (old) problem of spurious gauge modes is completely settled by now since the work\nof Press and Vishniac [5]. In some specific calculations it turns out to be useful to profit\nfrom the extra gauge freedom inherent in the synchronous description . There are examples\nin the literature of isocurvature modes that are divergent, at early times, in the longitudinal\ngauge, but which are perfectly physical and regular in the synchronous coordinate system\n[37]. Finally, it is important to consider the formulation of the problem of initial conditions\nin the synchronous gauge, since various numerical codes solving the Boltzmann hierarchy\nuse, indeed, the synchronous description.\nIn the synchronous description the line element can be consistently perturbed in the\nform:\nds2 = a2 (\u03b7)d\u03b7 2 \u2212 a2 (\u03b7)(\u03b4ij \u2212 hij )dxi dxj ,\n(4.1)\nwhere the perturbed element of the metric is given by\n\u03b4gij = a2 hij ,\n\n\u03b4g ij = \u2212\n\nhij\n.\na2\n\n(4.2)\n\nSometimes the parametrization \u03b4gij = 2a2 (\u03c8s \u03b4ij + \u2202i \u2202j Es ) is also employed [41]. The\nconnection between the two parametrizations is immediate by separating, in Fourier space,\nthe trace of the perturbation from its traceless part:\nhij (\u03b7, ~x) =\n4\n\nZ\n\n1\n~\nd3 keik*~x k\u0302i k\u0302j h(k, \u03b7) + 6\u03be(k, \u03b7) k\u0302i k\u0302j \u2212 \u03b4ij\n3\n\u0012\n\n\u0014\n\n\u0013\u0015\n\n,\n\n(4.3)\n\nAccording to the usual nomenclature, gauge modes are those modes arising when gauge freedom is not\ncompletely fixed, as in the synchronous gauge.\n\n19\n\n\fwhere k\u0302i = ki /|~k|. Clearly, by performing an infinitesimal gauge transformation the \u03b4g00\nand \u03b4g0i parts of the metric (which are not perturbed in the synchronous parametrization)\nalso transform. The gauge modes can be exactly identified by requiring that \u03b4g00 = 0 and\n\u03b4gij = 0, for gauge transformations that preserve the synchronous nature of the coordinate\nsystem. The first gauge mode corresponds to a spatial reparametrization of the constanttime hypersurfaces. As a consequence, in this mode the metric perturbation is constant\nand the matter density unperturbed. The second gauge mode corresponds to a spatially\ndependent shift in the time direction.\nWith the notation of Eqs. (4.2) and (4.3), the perturbed Einstein equations become\nH \u2032 3 2\nh = H [R\u03bd \u03b4\u03bd + (1 \u2212 R\u03bd )\u03b4\u03b3 + \u03a9B + \u03a9b \u03b4b + \u03a9c \u03b4c ],\n2\n\u0015\n\u00142\n4\n3 2 FB\n2 \u2032\n+ (R\u03bd \u03b8\u03bd + (1 \u2212 R\u03bd )\u03b8\u03b3 ) + \u03a9b \u03b8b + \u03a9c \u03b8c ,\nk \u03be =\u2212 H\n2\n4\u03c0\u03c3\u03c1 3\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u03a9B\n\u2032\u2032\n\u2032\n2\n2 1\nh + 2Hh \u2212 2k \u03be = 9H\n(R\u03bd \u03b4\u03bd + (1 \u2212 R\u03bd )\u03b4\u03b3 ) +\n,\n3\n3\n\u0015\n\u0014\n4\nh\u2032\u2032 + 6\u03be \u2032\u2032 + 2Hh\u2032 + 12H\u03be \u2032 \u2212 2k2 \u03be = 9H2 \u03c3B + R\u03bd \u03c3\u03bd ,\n3\nk2 \u03be \u2212\n\n(4.4)\n(4.5)\n(4.6)\n(4.7)\n\nwhere the background equations (2.3)\u2013(2.5) have already been used to eliminate the energy\nand pressure densities5 . By combining appropriately Eqs.

It is understood that the density contrasts and the peculiar velocity fields are not equal\nin the two gauges and are related by the transformations listed below (see Eqs. (4.26) and (4.28)).\n\n20\n\n\f\u03b8c\u2032 = \u2212H\u03b8c\n3\n2\n4\n4\n\u03c3\u03bd\u2032 = \u03b8\u03bd \u2212 kF\u03bd3 + h\u2032 + \u03be \u2032 .\n15\n10\n15\n5\n\n(4.16)\n(4.17)\n\nAs anticipated the synchronous gauge modes can be made harmless by eliminating the\nconstant solution for h and by fixing, for instance, the CDM velocity field to zero.

By setting \u03a9B = 0 in Eqs.

However, also\nisocurvature solutions can be generalized to include fully inhomogeneous magnetic fields.\nIn order to look for isocurvature solutions it is useful to recall that in looking for perturbative\nsolutions (both in the longitudinal and in the synchronous gauge) there are various small\nparameters. One is certainly k\u03b7, which is small outside the horizon. However, also \u03a9b\nand \u03a9c are small parameters deep within the radiation-dominated epoch. Let us make this\nstatement more precise by considering the scale factor\na(\u03b7) =\n\n\u0014\u0012\n\n\u03b7\n\u03b7\n+\n\u03b71\n\u03b71\n\u0013 \u0012\n\n\u00132 \u0015\n\n,\n\n(4.29)\n\ninterpolating between the radiation-dominated phase for \u03b7 \u226a \u03b71 and the matter dominated\nepoch for \u03b7 \u226b \u03b71 . In this case we can also write\na(\u03b7)\n,\na(\u03b7) + 1\n1\n,\n\u03a9B = \u03a9B\na(\u03b7) + 1\n\n\u03a9b,c = \u03a9b,c\n\n(4.30)\n(4.31)\n\nwhere the subscripts in Eq. (4.30) refer either to baryons or to CDM and where we took,\nfor simplicity, \u03b71 = 1.\nWe can then insert Eqs. (4.29) and (4.30)\u2013(4.31) into the evolution equations for the\nperturbations in the synchronous gauge, regarding \u03a9b,c as small paramters deep within the\nradiation-dominated epoch (\u03b7 \u2192 0). The result of this procedure is summarized by the\nfollowing solutions, which are valid in the case \u03c3B = \u03a9B /3:\nh \u2243 (\u22124\u03a9b \u03b7 + 6\u03a9b \u03b7 2 ),\n2\n\u03be \u2243 \u03a9b \u03b7 \u2212 \u03a9b \u03b7 2 ,\n3\n22\n\n(4.32)\n(4.33)\n\n\ffor the metric perturbations and\n8\n\u03b4\u03b3 \u2243 \u2212 \u03a9b \u03b7 + 4\u03a9b \u03b7 2 , \u2212\u03a9B (1 \u2212 \u03b7 + \u03b7 3 ),\n3\n\u03b4b = (1 \u2212 2\u03a9b + 3\u03a9b \u03b7 2 ),\n\u0013\n\u0012\n8\n\u03b4\u03bd \u2243 \u2212 \u03a9b \u03b7 + 4\u03a9b \u03b7 2 ,\n3\n\u03b4c \u2243 2\u03a9b + 3\u03a9b \u03b7 2 ,\n1\nk2\n\u03b8\u03b3 \u2243 \u2212 \u03a9b k2 \u03b7 2 \u2212 \u03a9B (4\u03b7 \u2212 2\u03b7 2 + \u03b7 4 ),\n3\n16\n2\nk\nR\u03b3\n1\n\u03b8\u03bd \u2243 \u2212 \u03a9b k2 \u03b7 2 \u2212 \u03a9B (4\u03b7 \u2212 2\u03b7 2 + \u03b7 4 ) ,\n3\n16\nR\u03bd\n\u03b8c = 0,\n\u03a9b\n\u03a9B\n2\nk2 \u03b73 \u2212\n(1 \u2212 \u03b7 + \u03b7 3 ),\n\u03c3\u03bd \u2243 \u2212\n3 2R\u03bd + 15\n4R\u03bd\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\n(4.34)\n(4.35)\n(4.36)\n(4.37)\n(4.38)\n(4.39)\n(4.40)\n(4.41)\n\nfor the fluid quantities. Clearly, for this mode, the adiabaticity condition is not satisfied.\nFurthermore, by transforming the solution to the Newtonian gauge, it is easy to check that\nthe longitudinal fluctuations of the metric vanish for \u03b7 \u2192 0. In the limit \u03a9B \u2192 0 this mode\nreduces to the baryon isocurvature mode already discussed in [37]. A similar solution can\nbe obtained by changing \u03a9b \u2192 \u03a9c .\n\n5\n\nTight-coupling expansion in magnetoactive plasmas\n\nOne of the analytical tools often employed in the theory of the CMB anisotropies is the\nso-called tight-coupling expansion [43]. Defining the differential optical depth as done in\nEq. (2.28) the exact tight-coupling limit is realized when \u03c3T \u2192 \u221e and 1/\u03c4 \u2032 \u2192 0. If tight\ncoupling is exact, photons and baryons are synchronized so well that the photon phase-space\ndistribution is isotropic in the baryon rest frame. Since the photon distribution is isotropic,\nthe resulting radiation is not polarized. However, as the decoupling time approaches there\nis a regime where |1/\u03c4 \u2032 | < 1 without being zero. The idea is then to tailor a systematic\nexpansion in powers of |1/\u03c4 \u2032 | and to consider not only the zeroth order but also higher\norders depending upon the accuracy required by the problem. The evolution equations to be\ndiscussed are essentially the radiative transfer equations which are, in turn, the Boltzmann\nequations written in terms of the brightness perturbations. Within the notation employed\nin the present paper, these equations are derived in the equations (B.26)\u2013(B.28) of the\nappendix. The brightness perturbations should be studied for each of the four Stokes\nparameters. The brightness perturbations \u2206I , connected with the first Stokes parameter I,\nare the temperature fluctuations, i.e. fluctuations in the intensity of the radiation field. As\ndiscussed in the appendix, recalling that n\u0302 is the direction of the comoving-three momentum\n\n23\n\n\fof the photon and defining \u03bc = k\u0302 * n\u0302, the evolution of the brightness perturbation is\n\u2206\u2032I\n\n1\n+ ik\u03bc\u2206I = (\u03c8 \u2212 ik\u03bc\u03c6) + \u03c4 \u2212\u2206I + \u2206I0 + \u03bcvb \u2212 P2 (\u03bc)S0 ,\n2\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u0015\n\n\u0014\n\n(5.1)\n\nwhere, in our notation, vb = \u03b8b /(ik) and\nS0 = \u2206I2 + \u2206Q0 + \u2206Q2 ,\n\n(5.2)\n\nwhere, with obvious notation (discussed in detail in the appendix)\n\u2206I (~k, n\u0302, \u03b7) =\n\nX\n\n(\u2212i)l (2l + 1)\u2206Il (~k, \u03b7)Pl (\u03bc),\n\nl\n\n\u2206Q (~k, n\u0302, \u03b7) =\n\nX\n\n(\u2212i)l (2l + 1)\u2206Ql (~k, \u03b7)Pl (\u03bc),\n\n(5.3)\n\nl\n\n\u2206Il and \u2206Ql being the l-th multipole of the brightness function \u2206I and \u2206Q .\nThe function P2 (\u03bc) = (3\u03bc2 \u2212 1)/2 in Eq. (5.2) is the Legendre polynomial of second\norder, which appears in the collision operator of the Boltzmann equation for the photons\ndue to the directional nature of Thompson scattering. The evolution equations for the\nbrightness perturbations connected with the Q and U Stokes parameters are\n1\n\u2206\u2032Q + ik\u03bc\u2206Q = \u03c4 \u2032 [\u2212\u2206Q + (1 \u2212 P2 (\u03bc))S0 ],\n2\n\u2206\u2032U + ik\u03bc\u2206U = \u03c4 \u2032 \u2212 \u2206U .\n\n(5.4)\n(5.5)\n\nFinally, in order to close the system, the baryon evolution equation should be added using\nthe definition vb = \u03b8b /(ik) either in Eq. (2.26) or in (3.8).:\nvb\u2032 + Hvb = \u2212ik\u03c6 \u2212\n\n\u03c4\u2032\n[3i\u2206I1 + vb ] \u2212 iWB (k),\n\u03b1\n\n(5.6)\n\nwhere\nWB (k) =\n\u03b1=\n\nFB\n,\n4\u03c0k\u03c1b a4\n\n3 \u03c1b\n.\n4 \u03c1\u03b3\n\n(5.7)\n(5.8)\n\nIn (5.6) the dipole of the brightness function appears directly. In fact, using the results\nderived in the appendix, the following chain of identities holds:\n3\n\u03b8\u03b3 = kF\u03b31 = 3\u2206I1 .\n4\n\n(5.9)\n\nwhere F\u03b31 is the dipole of the photon phase-space distribution and \u2206I1 is the monopole of\nthe brightness perturbation.\nThe idea is now to expand Eqs. (5.1) and (5.4) in powers of the small parameter\n\u01eb = |1/\u03c4 \u2032 |, i.e. the inverse of the differential optical depth of Thompson scattering. Before\n24\n\n\fdoing the expansion, it is useful to derive the hierarchy for the brightness functions in full\nanalogy with what is discussed in the appendix for the case of the neutrino phase-space\ndistribution. To this aim, each side of Eqs. (5.1)\u2013(5.4) and (5.6) will be multiplied by the\nvarious Legendre polynomials and the integration over \u03bc will be performed. Noticing that,\nfrom the orthonormality relation for Legendre polynomials (Eq.

After expanding the various moments of the\nbrightness function and the velocity field in \u01eb\n\u2206Il = \u2206Il + \u01eb\u03b4Il ,\n\u2206Ql = \u2206Ql + \u01eb\u03b4Ql ,\nvb = v b + \u01eb\u03b4vb ,\n\n(5.22)\n\nthe obtained expressions can be inserted into Eqs. (5.12)\u2013(5.17) and the evolution of the\nvarious moments of the brightness function can be found order by order.\nTo zeroth order in the tight-coupling approximation, the evolution equation for the\nbaryon velocity field, i.e. Eq. (5.14), leads to:\nv b = \u22123i\u2206I1 ,\n\n(5.23)\n\nwhile Eqs. (5.13) and (5.16) lead, respectively, to\n\u2206Q0 = \u2206I2 + \u2206Q2 .\n\u2206Q1 = 0.\n\n(5.24)\n\nFinally Eqs. (5.18) and (5.19) imply\n9\u2206I2 = \u2206Q0 + \u2206Q2 ,\n9\u2206Q2 = \u2206Q0 + \u2206I2 .\n\n(5.25)\n\nTaking together the four conditions expressed by Eqs. (5.24) and (5.25) we have, to zeroth\norder in the tight-coupling approximation:\n\u2206Ql = 0,\n\u2206Il = 0,\n\nl \u2265 0,\n\nl \u2265 2.\n\n(5.26)\n\nHence, to zeroth order in the tight coupling, the relevant equations are\nv b = \u22123i\u2206I1 ,\n\u2032\n\u2206I0\n\n+ k\u2206I1 = \u03c8 \u2032\n\n(5.27)\n(5.28)\n\nThis means, as anticipated, that to zeroth order in the tight-coupling expansion the CMB\nis not polarized since the quadrupole moment of the brightness is vanishing. Summing up\nEqs. (5.15) and (5.17) and using Eq. (5.27) in order to eliminate v b from the obtained\nexpression, we get to the following equation\ni\u03b1\nk\nk\n\u2032\n(\u03b1 + 1)\u2206I1 + H\u03b1\u2206I1 \u2212 \u2206I0 = (\u03b1 + 1)\u03c6 + WB (k).\n3\n3\n3\n26\n\n(5.29)\n\n\fFinally, the dipole term can be eliminated from Eq. (5.29) using Eq. (5.28). By doing so,\nEq. (5.29) leads to the wanted decoupled equation for the monopole:\n\u2032\u2032\n\n\u2206I0 +\n\n\u03b1\u2032\nk2\n\u03b1\u2032\nFB\nk2\n\u03b1\n\u2032\n\u2206I0 +\n\u2206I0 = \u03c8 \u2032\u2032 +\n\u03c8\u2032 \u2212 \u03c6 \u2212\n.\n\u03b1+1\n3(\u03b1 + 1)\n\u03b1+1\n3\n\u03b1 + 1 12\u03c0\u03c1b a4\n\u0014\n\n\u0015\n\n(5.30)\n\nIn the limit FB \u2192 0 the usual decoupled equation for the evolution of the monopole is\nrecovered.\nThe presence of the magnetic field modifies the evolution of the monopole. Hence, also\nthe dipole will be modified since the relation (5.28) stipulates that the monopole is a source\nof the dipole.\nTo first order in the tight-coupling limit, the relevant equations can be obtained by\nkeeping all terms of order \u01eb and by using the first-order relations to simplify the expressions.\nFrom Eq. (5.16) the condition \u03b4Q1 = 0 can be derived; from Eqs. (5.13) and (5.18)\u2013(5.19),\nthe following remaining conditions are obtained respectively:\n\u2212\u03b4Q0 + \u03b4I2 + \u03b4Q2 = 0,\n9\n1\n2\n\u03b4I2 \u2212 [\u03b4Q0 + \u03b4Q2 ] = k\u2206I1 ,\n10\n10\n5\n9\n1\n\u03b4Q2 \u2212 [\u03b4Q0 + \u03b4I2 ] = 0.\n10\n10\n\n(5.31)\n(5.32)\n(5.33)\n\nFinally from Eqs. (5.31)\u2013(5.33) the remaining relations are:\n5\n\u03b4Q0 = \u03b4I2 ,\n4\n1\n\u03b4Q2 = \u03b4I2 ,\n4\n8\n\u03b4I2 = \u2206I1 .\n15\n\n(5.34)\n(5.35)\n(5.36)\n\nCondition (5.36) can be also written\n\u2206I2 = \u01eb\u03b4I2 =\n\n8 k\n\u2206I1 .\n15 \u03c4 \u2032\n\n(5.37)\n\nNow, from Eqs. (5.34) and (5.35), the quadrupole moment of \u2206Q is proportional to the\nquadrupole of \u2206I , which is, in turn, proportional to the dipole evaluated to first order in\n\u01eb. But \u2206Q measures exactly the degree of linear polarization of the radiation field. So, to\nfirst order in the tight-coupling expansion, the CMB is linearly polarized. Furthermore, as\ndiscussed in Eq. (5.30) the presence of the magnetic field modifies the evolution of both\nthe monopole and the dipole. Thus, according to Eq. (5.37), also the polarization will be\nmodified.\nAll the the solutions discussed in the previous sections can be used to determine the\ninitial conditions for the evolution of the brightness using the tight-coupling expansion.\n27\n\n\fConsider, as a possible example, the case when initial conditions are set deep within the\nradiation epoch. In this case, recalling Eq. (5.8), Eq. (5.30) can be written for, \u03b1 \u226a 1, as\n\u2206\u2032\u20320 + \u03c9 2 \u22060 = \u2212\u03c9 2 (\u03c6 + \u03c8) \u2212\n\nFB\n,\n16\u03c0\u03c1\u03b3\n\n(5.38)\n\n\u221a\nwhere \u22060 = \u2206I0 \u2212 \u03c8 and \u03c9 = k/ 3; we also posit a4 \u03c1\u03b3 = \u03c1\u03b3 . The solution of Eq. (5.38) can\nbe easily obtained in terms of arbitrary integration constants. These constants are fixed\nby specifying the initial conditions for the velocity field vb , which determines, according to\nEq. (5.23), the value of the dipole. Suppose, for instance, to be interested in the case of\nquasi-adiabatic initial conditions in the presence of the reduced Lorentz force. Then, from\nEqs. (3.59) and (5.23), recalling that \u03b8b = ikvb ,\n\u2206I1 =\n\nk\u03c60\nFB\n\u03b7+\n.\n6\n12\u03c0\u03c1b a3\n\n(5.39)\n\nFrom Eq. (5.17) the initial condition for \u22060 can be determined to be:\nR\u03bd\n3\n3\n4\n\u03a9 B \u2212 \u03c3B .\n\u22060 \u2243 \u2212 1 + R\u03bd \u03c60 +\n2\n15\n5\n5\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\n(5.40)\n\nThe same strategy can be applied to more specific cases, such as the one where the scale\nfactor interpolates between a radiation-dominated phase and a matter-dominated phase, as\ndiscussed in Eq. (4.29). In this case the solution of Eq. (5.30) will be more complicated\nbut always analytically tractable.\n\n6\n\nConcluding remarks\n\nIn this paper a systematic treatment of scalar perturbations has been discussed in the presence of a fully inhomogeneous magnetic field. No specific configuration has been assumed\nand the results are, in this sense, rather general. Large-scale magnetic fields have been\ndescribed in a fully consistent one-fluid MHD approach in curved space-time, which is particularly suitable for the analysis of the low-frequency part of the plasma spectrum. In this\napproach the charged components of the plasma (baryons and electrons) are in thermal\nequilibrium at a common temperature. The neutral components of the plasma (photons,\nneutrinos and CDM particles) are not affected directly by the presence of the magnetic\nfields. However, since magnetic fields gravitate and appear in the perturbed Einstein equations, also the initial conditions for the evolution of the neutral species are modified in a\nspecific fashion. Since in MHD the Ohmic current is solenoidal, the baryon evolution equation is affected by a reduced Lorentz force term whose characteristic form is well known in\nflat-space MHD. The combination of these different effects leads to a set of initial conditions for the CMB anisotropies, which is rather different from the standard adiabatic (or\nisocurvature) modes.\nThe main new results of the present analysis can be summarized as follows:\n28\n\n\f\u2022 the problem of initial conditions for magnetized CMB anisotropies has been solved\nboth in the conformally Newtonian gauge (more useful for theoretical calculations)\nand in the synchronous gauge (more appropriate for numerical discussions);\n\u2022 if the curvature fluctuations are adiabatic, magnetic fields modify the conventional\nadiabatic mode in a computable way and, as a consequence, the whole system of\ninitial conditions for CMB anisotropies is modified;\n\u2022 for the modified adiabatic mode, deep outside the horizon, the density contrasts still\nsatisfy the adiabaticity condition, however, as the horizon is crossed, a small nonadiabatic component develops;\n\u2022 if the fluctuations are isocurvature from the beginning, magnetic fields modify quantitatively their amplitude, as shown in the case of the baryon isocurvature mode;\n\u2022 the tight-coupling expansion has been revisited in the presence of a fully inhomogeneous magnetic field;\n\u2022 it has been shown that, because of the reduced Lorentz force, both the zeroth and\nfirst order in the tight-coupling expansion are modified and this allows the initial\nconditions for the evolution of the brightness functions to be computed reliably in\nboth the adiabatic and isocurvature cases when fully inhomogeneous magnetic fields\nare present.\nIt is appropriate to conclude with some remarks concerning the interplay between large-scale\nmagnetic fields and CMB physics. In various investigations, limits on the magnetic field\nintensity are obtained on the basis of CMB considerations. Most of the times these limits\nrefer to specific configurations. These discussions are certainly valuable; however, the limits\nobtained should always be associated with a specific set of analytical initial conditions. As\nfar as scalar fluctuations are concerned, this was not done up to now. An example is Ref.\n[8] where no specific analysis of the initial condition problem was presented, but rather\nstringent limits were claimed.\nWe must bear in mind that the analysis of CMB anisotropies requires the determination\nof a sizeable set of parameters. If the magnetic field were the only unknown, the task\nwould be easier. However, this is unfortunately not the case. Hence, even within a specific\nmagnetic field configuration, the limits should always refer to the specific set of initial\nconditions assumed in the analysis, as is normally done in the case when magnetic fields are\nabsent. We do hope that future analyses along these directions may take the results of the\npresent paper as a useful format for the systematic investigation of the effects of large-scale\nmagnetic fields on the CMB anisotropies.\n\n29\n\n\fA\n\nBoltzmann hierarchy\n\nAs discussed in the bulk of the paper neutrinos are collisionless particles. In the following\nwe are going to discuss the collisionless Boltzmann equation following the notation discussed\nin the present paper. The phase-space distribution of massless particles (massless neutrinos\nor photons) is defined to be\nf (xi , Pi , \u03b7)dx1 dx2 dx3 dP1 dP2 dP3 = dN ,\n\n(B.1)\n\ngiving the number of particles in a differential volume of phase space. The function appearing in Eq. (B.1) is scalar under canonical transformations, Pi is the conjugate momentum.\nTo derive and use the Boltzmann equation in curved space-time it is more convenient to\nwork directly with the modulus q and the direction ni of the comoving three-momentum qi\n(where qi = qni with ni ni = 1). Denoting the longitudinal degrees of freedom of the perturbed geometry as in Eq. (2.6) and adopting the metric signature of Eq. (2.2), the relation\nbetween the comoving three-momentum and the components of the conjugate momentum\nare Pi = \u2212qi (1 \u2212 \u03c8) and P0 = q(1 + \u03c6),\nThe total variation of the distribution function can be written as\nDf\n\u2202f\n\u2202xi \u2202f\n\u2202f \u2202ni\n\u2202f \u2202q\n=\n+\n+\n=\n+\nD\u03b7\n\u2202\u03b7\n\u2202\u03b7 \u2202xi\n\u2202q \u2202\u03b7 \u2202ni \u2202\u03b7\n\n\u0012\n\n\u2202f\n\u2202\u03b7\n\n\u0013\n\n,\n\n(B.2)\n\ncoll\n\nwhere the collisional term has been kept for later convenience, but it is zero in the case of\nneutrinos. The collisionless part of Eq. (B.2) can be perturbed around a configuration of\nthermal equilibrium by splitting the phase-space distribution as\nf (xi , Pj , \u03b7) = f0 (q)[1 + f (1) (xi , q, nj , \u03b7)],\n\n(B.3)\n\nwhere f0 (q) is the unperturbed phase-space distribution, which only depends upon the\ncomoving three-momentum.\nInserting Eq. (B.3) into Eq. (B.2), only the terms that are first order will be kept.\nSince the unperturbed phase-space distribution only depends upon the comoving threemomentum, Eq. (B.2) becomes:\n\u2202f (1) \u2202 ln f0 \u2032\n1 \u2202f\n\u2202f (1)\n+ ni\n[\u03c8 \u2212 ni \u2202 i \u03c6] =\n+\ni\n\u2202\u03b7\n\u2202x\n\u2202 ln q\nf0 \u2202\u03b7\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\n,\n\n(B.4)\n\ncoll\n\nwhere the geodesic equation has been used in order to obtain the expression of the time\nderivative of q to first-order in the amplitude of the metric perturbations, i.e.\ndq\n= q\u03c8 \u2032 \u2212 qni \u2202 i \u03c6.\nd\u03b7\nUp to this point the derivation is valid for both photons and massless neutrinos.\n\n30\n\n(B.5)\n\n\fA.1\n\nMassless neutrinos and photons\n\nGoing now to Fourier space and defining the reduced phase-space distribution for massless\nneutrinos as\nR 3\nq dqf0 f (1)\n~\nF\u03bd (k, n\u0302, \u03b7) = R 3\n,\n(B.6)\nq dqf0\nEq.

(B.20)) and of the whole\nEq. (B.22), which couples the quadrupole, the peculiar velocity field, and the octupole F\u03bd3 .\nEquation (B.22) is important. After neutrino decoupling, when initial conditions are set,\nF\u03bd3 = 0.\nEquation (B.4) can also be made explicit in the case of photons. In order to do so the\ncollision term should be specified. Before writing down the Boltzmann equation for the\nphotons it is useful, in order to match with the standard notations, to define the photon\nbrightness perturbation, conventionally denoted by \u2206:\nf (xi , q, nj , \u03b7) = f0\n\n\u0012\n\nq\n,\n1+\u2206\n\u0013\n\n(B.23)\n\nwhere f0 (q), i.e. the unperturbed phase-space distribution, denotes now the Bose-Einstein\ndistribution. Comparing Eq. (B.3) with the expression given in Eq. (B.23) and expanding\nfor \u2206 < 1, the two definitions are connected as\n\u2206 = \u2212f\n\n(1)\n\n\u0012\n\n\u2202 ln f0\n\u2202 ln q\n\n\u0013\u22121\n\n,\n\nR\n\nq 3 dq \u2202\u2202lnlnfq0\n\nF\u03b3 = \u2212\u2206 R\n\n32\n\nq 3 dqf0\n\n= 4\u2206,\n\n(B.24)\n\n\fwhere F\u03b3 is the reduced phase-space distribution for the photons defined in full analogy with\nthe case of the massless neutrinos, i.e. Eq. (B.6). The second identity of Eq. (B.24) follows\nfrom the first and from Eq. (B.8). Using the relation between the brightness perturbation\nand the phase-space distribution, the collisionless part of the Boltzmann equation can be\nwritten as\n\u2206\u2032 + ik\u03bc(\u2206 + \u03c6) = \u03c8 \u2032 .\n(B.25)\nThe brightness perturbation, as defined in Eq. (B.23), corresponds physically to a perturbation in the first Stokes parameter (conventionally denoted by I), i.e. to the sum of the\nsquared amplitudes of the radiation field. By specifying the collision term, the full form of\nthe Boltzmann equation for photons can be written as\n1\n\u2206\u2032I + ik\u03bc\u2206I = (\u03c8 \u2032 \u2212 ik\u03bc\u03c6) + \u03c4 \u2032 \u2212\u2206I + \u2206I0 + \u03bcvb \u2212 P2 (\u03bc)S0 ,\n2\n\u0015\n\u0014\n1\n\u2206\u2032Q + ik\u03bc\u2206Q = \u03c4 \u2032 \u2212\u2206Q + (1 \u2212 P2 (\u03bc))S0 ,\n2\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2206U + ik\u03bc\u2206U = \u2212\u03c4 \u2206U .\n\u0014\n\n\u0015\n\n(B.26)\n(B.27)\n(B.28)\n\nConcerning Eqs. (B.26)\u2013(B.28) a few comments are in order. The brightness functions \u2206Q\nand \u2206U correspond, respectively, to the Stokes parameters Q and U. The parameter Q\nbeing the difference of the squares of the amplitudes of the radiation field, is sensitive to\nthe linearly polarized radiation. Since Q and U (unlike I and V) change under rotations,\nonce Q is included also U must follow. The source term appearing in Eq. (B.26), S0 is,\nwithin our conventions:\nS0 = \u2206I2 + \u2206Q0 + \u2206Q2 ,\n(B.29)\nwhere, with obvious notations, \u2206Il denotes the l-th multipole of \u2206I and similarly for \u2206Q .\nThe peculiar velocity field for the baryons has been written as\nvb =\n\n\u03b8b\n.\nik\n\n(B.30)\n\nThe notation vb is preferred here in view of the application to the tight-coupling expansion of\nthe Boltzmann hierarchy for the photon brightness. Finally, \u03c4 \u2032 = xe ne \u03c3T aa0 is, as previously\nintroduced, the differential optical depth for Thompson scattering. The evolution equation\nfor vb can be easily obtained, for instance by Fourier transforming Eq. (4.26) and by using\nEq. (B.30):\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u03c4\u2032\ni FB (k)\n\u2032\nvb + Hvb + ik\u03c6 +\n,\n(B.31)\n3i\u2206I1 + vb = \u2212\n\u03b1\n4\u03c0k a4 \u03c1b\nhaving defined\n\u03b1=\n\n3 \u03c1b\n.\n4 \u03c1r\n\nEquations (B.26)\u2013(B.28) and (B.31) are discussed in Section 4.\n\n33\n\n(B.32)\n\n\fReferences\n[1] Ya.
