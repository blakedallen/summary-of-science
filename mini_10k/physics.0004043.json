(iii) Travellingwave amplification in a semiconductor gain element with\na tapered waveguide (TA) [5,9,10]. Compared to a BAL\nthis yields higher gain and higher power after spatial filtering. This approach requires much lower input and a\nless complex optical setup than a BAL. However, a TA\ngain element is considerably more expensive.\nIn this work we investigate a TA system that amplifies the narrow-linewidth seed beam of an EGDL and\nprovides up to 200 mW optical output from a singlemode optical fiber. We operate the system on the D2\n(5S1/2 \u2192 5P3/2 ) transition of rubidium, at a wavelength\nof 780 nm. The input facet of the tapered gain element\nelement has the typical width of a low power singletransverse mode diode laser (\u2248 5 \u03bcm). A seed beam\nis amplified in a single pass and expanded laterally by\nthe taper to a width of typically 100 \u2212 200 \u03bcm [9] such\nthat the light intensity at the output facet is kept below\nthe damage threshold and the beam remains diffraction\nlimited. The output power can be much larger than from\na single-mode waveguide.\nIn previous work, TA's have been used as sources for\nfrequency-doubling and pumping solid state lasers [11].\nApart from the achievable output power, frequency tunability of the narrow-linewidth output [12], simultaneous\nmultifrequency generation [13], and spatial mode properties, including coupling to optical fibers [14] have been\naddressed.\nIn this paper we investigated the broadband spectral\nproperties of the TA. The background due to amplified\nspontaneous emission (ASE) [15] in the gain element was\nminimized by adjusting the amplifier's operating conditions, i.e. temperature, injection current and seed input\npower. We also investigated the coupling efficiency of the\nTA output to a single-mode optical fiber, and find that\nthe latter acts both as spatial and spectral filter. The\nproperties of three gain elements of same type are compared.\nAtom optical applications usually require good suppression of spectral background. E.g. in far off-resonance\noptical dipole traps [16], scattering of resonant light from\nthe background causes heating and atom loss. We discuss\nthe consequences of ASE background in such schemes.\n\nWe have characterized a semiconductor amplifier laser system which provides up to 200 mW output after a single-mode\noptical fiber at 780 nm wavelength.

INTRODUCTION\n\nThe techniques of laser cooling and trapping of neutral atoms [1] require stable, narrow linewidth and frequency tunable laser sources. Commonly used systems\nfor the near infrared wavelengths are based on external\ngrating diode lasers (EGDL) [2]. Optical feedback from\na grating narrows the linewidth to less than 1 MHz and\nprovides tunability. High-power single transverse mode\ndiode lasers can provide up to 80 mW optical output\nat wavelengths below 800 nm. In this power range diode\nlasers thus provide a less costly alternative to Ti:Sapphire\nlasers.\nIf more power is required, the output of an EGDL\ncan be amplified. Presently, there are three common\ntechniques based on semiconductor gain elements: (i)\nInjection-locking of a single-mode laser diode [3] by seeding light from an EGDL results typically in 60-80 mW\noptical power at 780 nm wavelength. (ii) Amplification in\na double-pass through a broad-area emitting diode laser\n(BAL) [4\u20137]. This yields an optical output of typically\n150 mW after spatial filtering. A disadvantage is the relatively low gain of 10-15, requiring high seed input power.\n1\n\n\fcollimators in a commercial xy flexure mount to allow\nfor lateral lens adjustment. The axial z adjustment is\ndone by two small translation stages. All adjustments\nexcept the z direction of the output collimator are accessible from outside. This proved to be very convenient for\nmode-matching the seed beam and also for compensating beam displacement of the TA output when changing\ntemperature or current.\nThe narrow spectral line of seed laser and amplifier\noutput was monitored by an optical spectrum analyzer\nof 1 GHz free spectral range with 50 MHz resolution. The\namplifier's broad spectral background was analyzed using\na grating spectrometer with a resolution of 0.27 nm. Also\nthe output of the single-mode fiber was recorded with the\nspectrometer.\n\nII. AMPLIFIER SETUP\n\nOur amplifier system consists of a seed laser, the output beam of which is amplified in a single pass by the\ntapered gain element, as shown in Fig. 1. The TA output\nis coupled into a single-mode optical fiber [17]. The seed\nlaser is an EGDL with a linewidth of less than 1 MHz.\nIt contains a 60 mW single-mode laser diode (Hitachi,\nHL 7851 G98). From the EGDL we have 28 mW of power\navailable to seed the amplifier at 780 nm wavelength.\nCoupling of the seeding beam to the amplifier is done by\nmode-matching the seed laser with the backwards travelling beam emitted by the TA. The divergence angles from\nseed laser emission and backward directed TA emission\nare similar. Hence, sufficient mode-matching is obtained\nusing identical collimation lenses for both (f = 4.5 mm,\nN.A.=0.55). Additional mode shaping, e.g. with anamorphic prism pairs is not necessary. An optical isolator with\n60 dB isolation protects the stabilized seed laser from\nfeedback by the mode-matched beam of the amplifier.\nThe 5 mm aperture of the isolator is sufficiently large\nthat it does not clip the elliptical seed beam.\nThe TA was a SDL 8630 E (ser.no. TD 310 [18]). According to the manufacturer's data sheet the output\npower ranges from 0.5 \u2212 0.55 W within a wavelength tuning range from 787 \u2212 797 nm, at an operating temperature of 21\u25e6 C. The beam quality parameter is specified\nas typically M 2 < 1.4 [18]. The TA should be protected\nfrom any reflected light, because it will be amplified in\nthe backward direction and may destroy the entrance\nfacet. We used an output collimator of large numerical\naperture (f = 3.1 mm, N.A.=0.68) and sent the beam\nthrough a second 60 dB optical isolator. The plane of\nthe tapered gain element is vertically oriented, so that\ndiffraction yields a large horizontal divergence. This is\ncollimated similar to the seed input, but yields a focus in\nthe vertical plane. With a cylindrical lens (f = 100 mm),\nwe compensated for astigmatism of the beam, in order to\ncouple into a single-mode optical fiber. The astigmatism\ncorrection is also shown in Fig. 1.\nThere is a considerable loss in optical power due to the\nisolator transmission. Taking also into account small reflection losses of the lens surfaces, we estimate the useful\noutput power to be 78 % of the optical power emitted by\nthe TA facet. In the remainder of this paper, all quoted\npowers are as measured with a power meter behind the\noptical isolator.\nThe amplifier was provided as an open heatsink device.\nWe mounted it on a water cooled base and stabilized it to\nthe desired operating temperature within a few mK by a\n40 W thermo-electric cooler. Thermal isolation from the\nambient air and electromagnetic shielding were provided\nby a metal housing. When operating the amplifier at\ntemperatures below the dew point, we flushed the containment with dry nitrogen.\nIt is necessary to have a compact, stable mounting\nof the gain element and collimators. We mounted the\n\nFIG. 1. Amplifier setup with seed laser and gain element:\nexternal grating diode laser (EGDL), 60 dB optical isolators (OI), tapered amplifier (TA), single-mode optical fiber\n(OF), optical spectrum analyzer (SA), and grating spectrometer (GS). A top and side view of the gain element is shown\nwith input and output collimators (IC,OC), and a cylindrical\nlens (CL) compensating for astigmatism (not to scale).\n\nIII. UNSEEDED OPERATION OF THE\nAMPLIFIER\n\nWhen the TA receives no seed input, it operates as a\nlaser diode. Thus, when the injection current, IT A , is\nincreased from zero, the optical output power shows the\nlasing threshold (see Fig. 3ab). Generally, both the operating wavelength and the optical power of a laser diode\ndepend on the temperature. This property is shown in\nFig. 2. The emission spectrum of the lasing tapered gain\nelement is almost Gaussian shaped, with an 1/e2 width\nof 4 nm. It appears as a background of ASE also in the\nspectra when operating the gain element as an amplifier\n(see below). The oscillatory structures on the spectra\nare artifacts of the spectrometer. In the fitted spectra,\n2\n\n\fwe evaluated the center wavelength at each temperature\nsetting. It increases with temperature with a slope of\n0.28 nm/K, typical for semiconductor lasers (Fig. 2b).\nThe temperature dependence of the output power is\nshown in Fig. 2c. We operated the TA within the specifications of the manufacturer's data sheet, that recommends to keep the optical power at the output facet below\n550 mW. As the temperature increases, the conversion\nefficiency (mW/A) decreases and the threshold current\nincreases. This can be seen in Fig. 3ab (open symbols)\nwhere we plot the optical output power P vs. current\nIT A for two temperature settings. The threshold current of the unseeded TA increases from 0.78 A (5\u25e6 C) to\n0.86 A (14\u25e6 C). From the slopes above threshold, we find\nthat the conversion efficiency decreases from 0.7 W/A\n(5\u25e6 C) to 0.5 W/A (14\u25e6 C). In order to measure the unperturbed output of the unseeded TA, one has to prevent\nlight emitted from the entrance facet of being reflected.\nEven a very weak reflection would be amplified in the\nforward direction.\nFor the unseeded TA, we also measured the light propagating backwards from the amplifier's entrance facet. It\nreaches typically a power of 10 \u2212 25 mW for injection\ncurrents from 1 \u2212 1.4 A. Hence the necessity of a good\nisolation of the seeding laser.\n\nFIG. 3. Amplifier output vs. injection current IT A and seed\npower Pseed . The lasing thresholds for the unseeded amplifier\nare 0.86 A (14\u25e6 C) and 0.78 A (5\u25e6 C), indicated by vertical\ndotted lines.\n\nWith Pseed \u2248 4 mW the device appears to be saturated for all current settings. For seed powers between 2 \u2212 4 mW, the amplification ranges from 70 \u2212 140,\ne.g. 320 mW output with 4 mW seed.\nWe now discuss the spectral properties of the TA and\nin particular the suppression of ASE background. Fig. 4\nshows the power spectral density of the TA output before an optical fiber for 16\u25e6 C and 5\u25e6 C operating temperature. In both cases the amplifier was saturated with\n28 mW seed input. For comparison also the corresponding spectra of the unseeded amplifier are shown. In saturation, the broad ASE background is distinguished from\na narrow peak of the amplified seed signal. The width of\nthe peak is given by the bandwidth of the spectrometer,\n0.27 nm FWHM. (By means of an optical spectrum analyzer and Doppler-free spectroscopy signals of rubidium,\nwe could verify that the amplified signal has a narrow\nwidth comparable to that of the EGDL.)\nThe influence of the operating temperature is obvious\nfirst by the increased output power at lower temperature: 323 mW (16\u25e6 C) and 410 mW (5\u25e6 C), respectively.\nSecond, both the peak level and total amount of ASE\nbackground are better suppressed at lower temperature.\nWe attribute this to the shift of the gain profile of the TA\ntowards the seed wavelength of 780 nm at lower temperature [15]. The fraction of ASE background in the TA\noutput is obtained by integrating the power spectral densities in Fig. 4, yielding 5.6 % (16\u25e6 C) and 1.4 % (5\u25e6 C),\nrespectively.\nMore than the total ASE fraction, for atom-optical applications the important figure is the fraction of ASE\nwithin the natural linewidth of the atomic transition\nused. We define this ratio \u01eb by comparing the power\nin the peak with the ASE power in a bandwidth given\nby a typical atomic natural linewidth, e.g. \u0393/2\u03c0 =\n6 MHz for rubidium. For 16\u25e6 C (5\u25e6 C), the peak value\n\nFIG. 2. Temperature dependence of the unseeded amplifier\nat 1.2 A injection current: (a) spectra, (b) center wavelengths,\n(c) output power after optical isolator. Solid lines indicate\nlinear fits.\n\nIV. AMPLIFICATION OF A SEED BEAM\n\nAmplification of a seed beam is evident in the output\npower of the TA. In Fig. 3ab, we have plotted the output\npower for distinct seed powers, Pseed , at two temperature settings. For the larger seed inputs of 8.6 mW and\n5.3 mW, respectively, the amplifier was well saturated.\nThe saturation is evident from Fig. 3c where Pseed was\nvaried for injection currents from 0.8 \u2212 1.3 A.\n\n3\n\n\fof +2.5 dBm/nm (\u22122.0 dBm/nm) of ASE is then reexpressed as 22 nW/\u0393 (7.9 nW/\u0393). With 323 mW\n(410 mW) in the narrow line, the suppression ratio \u01eb\nis \u221272 dB (\u221277 dB). We can thus optimize the spectral\nproperties of the TA output by an appropriate choice of\noperating temperature. Even better suppression can be\nachieved by use of an optical fiber as spectral filter, as\ndiscussed in the following section.\n\nV. SPATIAL AND SPECTRAL FILTERING\nUSING AN OPTICAL FIBER\n\nFor many applications, laser beam quality is an important property, e.g. for optical dipole traps. A convenient\nmethod to obtain spatial filtering is to send the light\nthrough a single-mode optical fiber. An additional advantage of the fiber is a decoupling of optical alignment\nbetween different parts of the experimental setup. Here\nthe coupling efficiency is discussed and the spectrum of\nthe transmitted light is compared with the spectrum before the fiber. We observe that spatial filtering by the\nfiber is accompanied by spectral filtering. Evidently, the\ncontribution of ASE in the TA beam is spatially distinguishable from the amplified seed signal.\nWe find that the spatial mode properties of the saturated TA output are slightly different for different injection currents. Fig. 5ab represents the fiber transmission\nvs. current, IT A . The fiber coupling was optimized for a\ncurrent of 1 A and the TA was saturated. A maximum\ntransmission of 46 % is achieved. For comparison, with an\nEGDL, after circularizing the beam using an anamorphic\nprism pair, we typically obtain a fiber transmission of\n75 %. The slope in the transmission curve is probably due\nto a beam displacement caused by the current-dependent\nthermal load of the gain element. Such a displacement\nwas also observed when the operating temperature was\nchanged. With the fiber coupling thus optimized, light\nfrom the unseeded TA has less transmission than the amplified seed signal. Fig. 5cd shows for a fixed current of\n1 A, that the fiber transmission is almost independent\nof the seed input power, i.e. the beam shape does not\nchange.\nAlso the light after the fiber has been analyzed using the grating spectrometer, see Fig. 6a for an operating temperature of 5\u25e6 C. For the saturated amplifier a\nspectral ASE background cannot be distinguished after\nthe fiber, since the peak is identical with the spectrometer response function. (This response function was obtained by recording the spectrum of the narrow-linewidth\nEGDL laser. A similar response was also obtained using a HeNe laser.) Thus we can only give an upper\nlimit for the ASE contribution of 0.2 %. The suppression ratio is \u01eb < \u221282 dB, with an ASE level of less than\n\u221212.5 dBm/nm or 0.7 nW/\u0393, respectively. This should\nbe compared to the value of \u01eb = \u221277 dB before the fiber,\nas seen in Fig. 4b for 5\u25e6 C. For comparison, at 16\u25e6 C, we\nfound an ASE suppression of only \u221276 dBm after the\nfiber.\nThe ASE background depends also on the degree of\namplifier saturation, as shown in Fig. 6b. The ASE fraction is plotted vs. seed power for light before and after\nthe fiber. It decreases quickly as the TA saturates. From\nthe spectra acquired before the fiber (up triangles), it is\nevident that the increase of seed power into the saturated\nregime suppresses the ASE. Whereas mode matching of\nthe seed input beam was not difficult for achieving max-\n\nFIG. 4. Spectrum of the amplifier output (before the fiber).\nThe seed power is 28 mW at 1.2 A injection current. The\ndashed curves are for unseeded operation. P is the total optical power, ASE is the fraction of background power, and \u01eb is\nthe ASE suppression for the power spectral density in units\nof mW/\u0393 (\u0393/2\u03c0 = 6 MHz).\n\nFIG. 5.

The symbols: seeded with 28 mW (solid), unseeded (open), fiber input (up triangles), fiber output (down\ntriangles), fiber transmission (circles).\n\n4\n\n\fferences among the gain elements. TD 430 has similar\nsaturation properties as TD 310. In contrast, TD 387 operates at maximum output power already without seed.\nThis may be due to different antireflection coatings at the\nTA facets. Hence, the TD 387 requires (permanent) monitoring by a spectrometer in order to optimize seed incoupling and ASE suppression. The current of the TD 387\ncannot be tuned continuously, because it shows discrete\n\"locking-ranges\", resembling the injection-locking behavior of single-mode diode lasers.\n\nimum output power, optimal ASE suppression required\na more careful alignment, thus optimizing the TA saturation.\nIt is also obvious from the figure, that larger gain of\nthe TA improves the output spectrum (circles, larger operating current).\nWe can summarize the results of Sec. IV and V as follows: The spectral properties of the TA can be optimized\nby choosing an appropriate operating temperature, spectral filtering with an optical fiber and saturation of the\ngain element.\n\nVII. FAR OFF-RESONANCE DIPOLE\nPOTENTIALS WITH SPECTRAL\nBACKGROUND\n\nIn this section we present an estimate of the consequences of the broad spectral ASE background for light\nscattering in optical dipole traps. A background that covers atomic resonances, leads to extra resonant scattering.\nUsually the detuning \u03b4 for a dipole trap is chosen as large\nas possible, given the available laser intensity I. The reason is that off-resonance scattering scales as \u0393\u2032OR \u221d I/\u03b4 2\nat low saturation and large detuning, whereas the dipole\npotential is only inversely proportional to the detuning,\nU \u221d I/\u03b4 [21].\nIn the presence of a resonant background the total scattering rate of the atoms is \u0393\u2032 = \u0393\u2032OR + \u0393\u2032R , where \u0393\u2032R represents the resonant scattering. For a fixed depth of the\noptical dipole potential this results in a maximum useful\nlaser detuning, \u03b4max , at which the scattering rate of the\natoms, \u0393\u2032 , is minimized.\nWith low atomic saturation by a weak spectral background, we can write \u0393\u2032R \u2248 (\u0393\u03c0/4)\u01ebI/I0 . Here I0 is the\nsaturation intensity, i.e. 1.6 mW/cm2 for the D2 line\nof rubidium. Hence, with the requirement of a fixed\npotential U, the two scattering contributions scale as\n\u0393\u2032OR \u221d 1/\u03b4 and \u0393\u2032R \u221d \u03b4, respectively. This results in\nthe optimum detuning and minimum scattering rate,\n\u221a\n\u03b4max = \u00b1\u0393/ 2\u03c0\u01eb,\n\u221a\n\u0393\u2032 = 2 2\u03c0\u01eb U/h\u0304.\n\nFIG. 6. Spectral filtering by a single-mode optical fiber. (a)\nSaturated with 28 mW seed power at 1.2 A current, 130 mW\npower after the fiber, 410 mW in front of it. ASE background\nis not distinguishable from the spectrometer response function after the fiber. (b) The ASE fraction depends on the\nsaturation: fiber input (up triangles) and output (down triangles) at 1.2 A current. For comparison: fiber input with\n1.45 A current (circles).\n\nVI. VARIATION IN THE PROPERTIES OF\nINDIVIDUAL GAIN ELEMENTS\n\nWe compared the gain element with two other gain\nelements of the same type (8630 E). One gain element\n(ser. no. TD 430, 777 nm) was used in the setup described above. A second (ser. no. TD 387, 790 nm) was\nimplemented in a commercial TA system (TUI Optics\nGmbH, TA 100) and operated on both the D2 and the\nD1 (5S1/2 \u2192 5P1/2 ) transition of rubidium at 780 nm\nand 795 nm, respectively.\nFor the different gain elements, we found considerable\ndifferences in their beam quality and consequently their\nfiber coupling efficiency. Whereas TD 310 and TD 387\nshowed a dominant double-lobed mode structure in the\nfar field and permitted only a fiber transmission of 46 %,\nthe TD 430 beam showed a less pronounced lobe structure [20]. With this gain element, we could couple 59 % to\nthe fiber and obtained 200 mW of optical power after the\nfiber and an ASE suppression of better than \u221284 dBm.\nAlso the amplification properties showed striking dif-\n\nAs an example we consider atoms cooled to a temperature of a few \u03bcK in optical molasses and require an\noptical potential depth of U/h \u2248 1 MHz. If the allowable scattering rate is, e.g. \u0393max < 100 s\u22121 , this yields\na required background suppression \u01eb < \u2212110 dB and\noptimum detuning \u03b4max \u2248 760 GHz. Such a small background contribution is of course beyond the resolution of\nour spectrometric data, with which we observe at best\nan upper limit of IR (\u03b4) < 0.7 nW/\u0393 for a total optical power of 200 mW. This corresponds to a background\nsuppression of \u01eb < \u221284 dB. With a detuning of 760 GHz,\nthe extension of the optical potential is restricted to less\nthan 250 \u03bcm.\n\n5\n\n\f[2] C.E.

CONCLUSIONS\n\nWe have investigated a tapered semiconductor amplifier system, that provides 150-200 mW narrow linewidth\noutput from a single-mode optical fiber, where the fiber\ntransmission is up to 59 %, depending on the actual gain\nelement in use. The system requires less than 5 mW seed\ninput to saturate with an amplification up to 140 at this\nseed level. The output of the amplifier includes a broad\nspectral background of amplified spontaneous emission.\nWe have found three means of reducing this background:\n(i) Choosing the operating temperature such that the\ngain profile of the amplifier is spectrally centered as\nclose as possible to the amplified wavelength, (ii) spectrally filtering the output beam with a single-mode optical fiber, and (iii) saturating the amplifier with sufficient seed input power. With those measures, the ASE\nbackground is below the resolution of our spectrometer.\nThat is, the ASE fraction is less than 0.2 % of the optical power in the beam and the peak level is less than\n0.1 nW/MHz. Relating the power spectral density of the\nbackground to the natural transition linewidth of rubidium (\u0393/2\u03c0 = 6 MHz), the ASE suppression is better than\n-82 dB.\nWe discussed the atom optical application of such an\namplifier system with far off-resonance dipole potentials.\nA broad ASE background implies here an optimum laser\ndetuning with which light scattering by atoms is minimized.\nA tapered amplifier system may be a lower-cost option\nto a Ti:Sapphire laser. The available single-transverse\nmode optical power and spectral properties are similar\nto those of broad-area semiconductor laser amplifiers.\nIX. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\nWe wish to thank K.
