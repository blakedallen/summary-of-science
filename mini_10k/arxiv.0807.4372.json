These limiting symmetries are shown at the\nvertices of the symmetry triangle [2] of the model, shown in Fig. 1.\nAn energy functional can be obtained [4] in the classical limit of the model, through\nthe use of the coherent state formalism [5, 6]. Studying this energy functional in the\nframework of catastrophe theory one can see [7] that a first order phase transition (in the\nEhrenfest classification) is predicted to occur between the limiting symmetries U(5) and\nSU(3), while a second order phase transition is expected between U(5) and O(6). We\nrefer to these transitions as shape/phase transitions. A narrow shape coexistence region\nis then predicted [4] in the symmetry triangle of the IBA, separating the spherical and\ndeformed phases. The shape coexistence region shrinks into the point of second order\nphase transition as the U(5)-O(6) line is approached, as shown in Fig. 1.\n\n\fO(6)\n\nE(5)\nDeformed\n\nSpherical\n\nU(5)\n\nX(5)\n\nSU(3)\n\nFIGURE 1. IBA symmetry triangle with the three dynamical symmetries. The critical point models\nE(5) and X(5) are placed close to the phase transition region (slanted lines). The solid curve indicates the\nAlhassid-Whelan arc of regularity. Adopted from Ref. [3].\n\nShape/phase transitions have been considered recently in the framework of the geometric collective model [8] as well, in which the collective variables \u03b2 and \u03b3 are used.\nThe second order transition between U(5) and O(6) has been described by the E(5) critical point symmetry [9], using in the Bohr Hamiltonian [10] a potential independent of\n\u03b3 and having the shape of an infinite square well potential in \u03b2 , while the first order\ntransition between U(5) and SU(3) has been described by the X(5) critical point symmetry [11], using in the Bohr Hamiltonian a potential of the form u(\u03b2 ) + v(\u03b3 ), with u(\u03b2 )\nhaving again the shape of an infinite square well potential in \u03b2 , and v(\u03b3 ) being a steep\nharmonic oscillator centered around \u03b3 = 0. E(5) and X(5) are shown in Fig. 1, close to\nthe points of the second and first order phase transitions of the IBA, respectively.\nThe IBA model predictions have also been studied using different measures of chaotic\nbehavior. It has been found that chaotic behavior prevails over most of the symmetry\ntriangle, with the noticeable exception of two regions, in which highly regular behavior\nis observed [12]. One of them is located along the U(5)-O(6) line, and its existence is\ndue to the O(5) symmetry known to survive along the whole line [13]. The other regular\nregion is connecting U(5) and SU(3) through a narrow path within the triangle, called the\nAlhassid\u2013Whelan arc of regularity [12] (also shown in Fig. 1), the symmetry implying\nits existence being yet unknown.\nStates with zero angular momentum are of particular interest, since centrifugal effects\nare absent, facilitating the detection of underlying symmetries. In the U(5) limit of\nthe IBA, the energies of 0+ states increase linearly with the number of d bosons,\ncorresponding to their phonon number. In the SU(3) limit, the energies of 0+ bandheads\nare determined by the eigenvalues of the second order Casimir invariant of SU(3), the\nresults shown in Table 1. In the O(6) limit, they are determined by the second order\nCasimir invariant of O(6), the results also shown in Table 1. From Table 1 it is clear\nthat in the limit of large boson numbers NB , the energies of 0+ bandheads in all three\ndynamical symmetries of the IBA grow linearly, E = An.\nIBA numerical calculations have been performed using the recently developed code\n\n\fTABLE 1.

Moreover, they increase as n(n + 3). Similarly, energies of 0+ states\nwithin Z(4) [26] [similar to Z(5), but with \u03b3 fixed to \u03c0 /6] increase as n(n + 2.5). Within\n\n\fTABLE 2.

These results can be easily interpreted [3] by taking into account\nthe order of the Bessel functions appearing as eigenfunctions in these models, given\nin Table 3, as well as the fact that the spectra of the Bessel functions J\u03bd are found\nto increase approximately as n(n + \u03bd + 3/2), this result being exact only for \u03bd = 1/2\n[3]. Consideration of the second order Casimir operator of E(n) [28, 26], the Euclidean\nalgebra in n dimensions, shows [3] that the present situation is a partial dynamical\nsymmetry [29] of Type I [30], in which some of the states (the 0+ states in the present\ncase) preserve all the relevant symmetry. The recent conjecture [31] of a partial SU(3)\ndynamical symmetry underlying the Alhassid\u2013Whelan arc of regularity is also receiving\nattention.\nIt is a nontrivial result [3] that the IBA near the critical point of the first order transition\nalso yields energies of 0+ states increasing as n(n + 3), i.e. in the same way as critical\npoint symmetries based on infinite square well potentials in 5 dimensions (degrees of\nfreedom) predict, as shown in Table 2.\nIn conclusion, 0+ states in the large boson number limit of the IBA exhibit many\ninteresting properties, as well as degeneracies to non-zero angular momentum states,\nwhich invite further investigations into determining of the symmetries underlying these\nregularities.\n\n\fACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWork supported in part U.S. DOE Grant No. DE-FG02-91ER-40609 and under Contract\nDE-AC02-06CH11357.\n\nREFERENCES\n1.
