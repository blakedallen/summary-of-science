In this paper we show that, in particular, the homology at degree\n(n \u2212 1), with n the number of indeterminates of the ring, plays an important role for this algebraic description in terms of Stanley and irreducible\ndecompositions. Keywords: Koszul homology, monomial ideal, irreducible decomposition, Stanley decomposition, Betti numbers\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nKoszul homology of a module over a polynomial ring is a very relevant invariant\nthat describes the structure of such modules [1, 4, 6], we can read from it the\nmain homological informations about the module, namely its Betti numbers,\nminimal free resolutions, Hilbert series, etc. In the case of monomial ideals,\ntheir combinatorial nature is reflected in their Koszul homology [8], we can\nthen speak of combinatorial Koszul homology [12].\nIn this context, combinatorial Koszul homology can also be used to describe\nthe algebraic structure of monomial ideals, in terms of irreducible and Stanley decompositions. The (n \u2212 1)-st Koszul homology modules play here a very\nrelevant role due to the correspondence between the multidegrees in which the\ncorresponding (n \u2212 1)-st Koszul homology is not null and the maximal standard\nmonomials with respect to the ideal. This correspondence allows us not only\nto describe the above named decompositions of a monomial ideal but also to\ncompute them modifying existing algorithms used to compute Koszul homology of monomial ideals. This kind of algorithms show good performance when\ncompared to algorithms specialized in irreducible decompositions.\nThe paper is organized as follows: Section 2 gives the definition and basic\nproperties of the Koszul homology of monomial ideals. We give also here some\nnotations that will be used through the text. Sections 3 and 4 contain the main\nresults and procedures to obtain algebraic descriptions of monomial ideals from\ntheir Koszul homology. Finally, in Section 5 we show the algorithms that we\nhave implemented to obtain irreducible decompositions using their relation to\nKoszul homology, and compare with other approaches.\n\u2217 Universit\n\ndegli Studi Genova (Italy) bigatti@dima.unige.it\nde La Rioja (Spain) eduardo.saenz-de-cabezon@unirioja.es\n\n\u2020 Universidad\n\n1\n\n\f2\n\nKoszul homology of monomial ideals\n\nLet R = k[x1 , . . . , xn ] be the polynomial ring in n indeterminates over a field k\nof caracteristic 0. Let V be an n dimensional k-vector space, and SV, \u2227V the\nsymmetric and exterior algebras over V respectively. Let us take a basis of V\nand denote it {x1 , . . . , xn } so that we can identify SV and R.\nConsider the following complex:\n\u2202\n\n\u2202\n\n\u2202\n\nK : 0 \u2192 R \u2297k \u2227n V \u2192 R \u2297k \u2227n\u22121 V \u2192 * * * R \u2297k \u22271 V \u2192 R \u2297k \u22270 V \u2192 0\nwhere the differential \u2202 is defined by the following rule\n\n\u2202(x\u03bc1 1 . . . x\u03bcnn \u2297xj1 \u2227* * *\u2227xji ) =\n\ni\nX\n\n(\u22121)k+1 xjk *x\u03bc1 1 . . . x\u03bcnn \u2297xj1 \u2227* * *\u2227x\u02c6jk \u2227* * *\u2227xji\n\nk=1\n\nThis differential verifies \u2202 2 = 0 and makes K a complex, which is called the\nKoszul complex. This complex is exact and it is therefore a minimal free\nresolution of the base field k.\nDefinition 2.1 Let M be an R-module. The complex K(M) := M \u2297R K is\ncalled the Koszul complex of M. K(M) is not exact in general, and its homology\nis called the Koszul homology of M; it will be denoted H\u2217 (K(M)) or H\u2217 (M)\nfor short.\nIf the module M is (multi)-graded then K(M) and H\u2217 (M) are also (multi)graded, since \u2202 preserves multidegree. Monomial ideals are a particular case\ni\n\nof multigraded modules with the natural multigrading mdeg(xi ) = (0, . . . , 1\n, . . . , 0). This multigrading induces the following multigrading in K(M): mdeg(x\u03bc \u2297\nj1\n\njk\n\nxj1 \u2227 * * * \u2227 xji )) = \u03bc + (0, . . . , 1 , . . . , 1 , . . . , 0). We denote Hi,\u03bc (K(I)) the multidegree \u03bc component of Hi (K(I)).\nExample 2.2 Let I \u2286 k[x1 . . . , xn ] be a monomial ideal. Let c \u2208 I \u2297 \u2227n\u22121 V\nsuch that mdeg(c) = \u03bc. Then c is of the form:\nc = a1 \u2297 x2 \u2227 * * * \u2227 xn + a2 \u2297 x1 \u2227 x3 \u2227 * * * \u2227 xn + an \u2297 x1 \u2227 * * * \u2227 xn\u22121\n\u03bc\n\n*x\nwhere the ai are monomials. Since mdeg(c) = \u03bc then mdeg(ai ) = mdeg( xx1i***x\n).\nn\nNow, c is a cycle iff \u2202(c) = 0. On the other hand, c is a boundary if there exists\nc\u2032 \u2208 I \u2297 \u2227n V such that \u2202c\u2032 = c. If c\u2032 = b \u2297 x1 \u2227 * * * \u2227 xn then\n\n\u2202(c\u2032 ) = x1 *b\u2297x2 \u2227* * *\u2227xn \u2212x2 *b\u2297x1 \u2227x3 \u2227* * *\u2227xn +(\u22121)n+1 xn *b\u2297x1 \u2227* * *\u2227xn\u22121 .\nSince \u2202 preserves multidegree, we have that mdeg(c\u2032 ) = mdeg(c), hence\nmdeg(b) = mdeg(\n\u03bc\n\nx\u03bc\n).\nx1 * * * xn\n\u03bc\n\ni+1 xi ***x\nTaking now a monomial x\u03bc \u2208 I, if xx1i ***x\n***xn \u2208 I we take ai = (\u22121)\nx1 ***xn , then\nPn\nc = i=1 ai \u2297 x1 \u2227 * * * \u2227 x\u0302i \u2227 * * * \u2227 xn is a cycle in I \u2297 \u2227n\u22121 V which is a boundary\n\n2\n\n\f\u03bc\n\n\u03bc\n\n/ I then c is a generator of Hn\u22121,\u03bc (K(I)).

This equality will be\nunderlying all the work in the following pages:\ndimk (Ki,\u03bc (I)) = dimk (T ori,\u03bc (I, k)) = \u03b2i,\u03bc (I)\n\n(1)\n\nTo finish this section we give some notations that will be used through the\npaper and we also introduce two simplicial complexes that can be associated\nto a monomial ideal I and a multidegree \u03bc the simplicial homology of which is\nequivalent to the Koszul homology of I at multidegree \u03bc. These complexes are a\nprominent example of techniques at the interplay of combinatorics and algebra\nthat are ubiquitous when dealing with monomial ideals.\nNotations:\n\u2022 Given a multidegree \u03bc \u2208 Nn we denote by supp(\u03bc) the nonzero indices of\n\u03bc and call it the support of \u03bc. The support of the monomial x\u03bc is the\nset {xi |i \u2208 supp(\u03bc)}. We say that a multidegree \u03bc (correspondingly a\nmonomial x\u03bc ) has full support if supp(\u03bc) = {1, . . . , n}.\n\u2022 For every monomial ideal I, we denote by Bn\u22121 (I) the set of multidegrees\n\u03bc such that Hn\u22121,\u03bc (I) 6= 0.\nDefinition 2.4 Let \u03bc \u2208 Nn , we say that its lowered multidegree low(\u03bc) is \u03bc\u2032\nwhere \u03bc\u2032i = max(\u03bci \u2212 1, 0) i.e. we substract one from every index in the support\nof \u03bc.\nDefinition 2.5 Let I \u2286 k[x1 , . . . , xn ] a monomial ideal, and \u03bc \u2208 Nn . We define\nthe (upper) Koszul simplicial complex associated to I at \u03bc, denoted \u2206I\u03bc as\n\u2206I\u03bc = {squarefree vectors \u03c4 |x\u03bc\u2212\u03c4 \u2208 I}\nDually, we define the lower Koszul simplicial complex associated to I at \u03bc,\ndenoted \u2206\u03bcI as\n\u2206\u03bcI = {squarefree vectors \u03c4 |xlow(\u03bc)+\u03c4 \u2208\n/ I}\nThe relation between the Koszul homology of I and the simplicial homology\nof these complexes is the following:\nProposition 2.6\nHi,\u03bc (K(I)) \u2243 H\u0303i\u22121 (\u2206I\u03bc ) \u2243 H\u0303 |supp(\u03bc)|\u2212i\u22122 (\u2206\u03bcI )\nin this context H\u0303 i simply means H\u0303\u2212i .\n3\n\n(2)\n\n\fProof:\n\nFor the first equivalence, we use the isomprphism\n\u03c4 7\u2192\n\nx\u03bc\n\u2297 x\u03c41 \u2227 * * * \u2227 x\u03c4n \u2200\u03c4 = (\u03c41 , . . . , \u03c4n ).\nx\u03c4\n\n(3)\n\nThe second equivalence is just the Alexander duality between \u2206I\u03bc and \u2206\u03bcI (see\n[8]).\nExample 2.7 Let I \u2286 k[x1 , . . . , xn ] a monomial ideal. We have that Hn\u22121,\u03bc (K(I)) \u2243\nH\u0303n\u22122 (\u2206I\u03bc ). Since \u2206I\u03bc is a subcomplex of the standard n-simplex \u2206n , we have\nthat the only possibility of \u2206I\u03bc has homology at degree n \u2212 2 is that all (n \u2212 1)faces of \u2206n are in \u2206I\u03bc and the only n-face of \u2206n is not in \u2206I\u03bc , in which case\nHn\u22122 (\u2206I\u03bc ) \u2243 k. Observe that due to (3) the (n \u2212 1)- faces correspond to the\n\u03bc\n*x\u03bc\nmonomials xx1i***x\nand the n-face corresponds to x1x***xn . Therefore:\nn\nHn\u22121,\u03bc (K(I)) = Hn\u22122 (\u2206I\u03bc ) \u2243\n\n\u001a\n\nk\n0\n\nif\n\nxi *x\u03bc\nx1 ***xn\n\n\u03bc\n\n\u2208 I \u2200i and x1x***xn \u2208\n/I\nin any other case\n\nFrom the example 2.7 we can see that the geometric realization of the multidegrees \u03bc \u2208 Bn\u22121 (I) can be called maximal corners. We shall give the same\nname to the corresponding multidegree:\nDefinition 2.8 We say that a monomial x\u03bc is a closed corner if xi *\u03bc\u2032 \u2208 I \u2200xi \u2208\nsupp(\u03bc). We say that a monomial is a maximal corner if it is a closed corner\nwith maximal support.\nIt is clear that x\u03bc is a maximal corner if and only if \u03bc \u2208 Bn\u22121 (I), for\ngeneral closed corners only the direct statement is verified i.e. x\u03bc is a closed\ncorner \u21d2 H|supp(x\u03bc )|\u22121,\u03bc (K(I)) 6= 0. Maximal corners correspond to maximal\n\u2032\nstandard monomials, more precisely x\u03bc is a closed corner iff x\u03bc is a maximal\nstandard monomial, i.e. a monomial that is not in I and is maximal with respect\nto divisibility among the monomials not in I. Figure 1 shows an example of\nmaximal and closed corners.\nWe finish the section with some definitions that will be needed in the rest of\nthe paper.\nDefinition 2.9\n\u2022 Let I be a monomial ideal, its artinian closure I\u02c6 is the\nsmallest artinian ideal such that the set of minimal generators of I is\n\u02c6\nincluded in the set of minimal generators of I.\n\u2022 If I = hm1 , . . . , mr i then \u03bb(I) := lcm(m1 , . . . , mr ) denotes the least common multiple of all the minimal generators of I.\nLet \u03bb = \u03bb(I), observe that I\u02c6 = I + hx\u03bb1 1 +1 , . . . , x\u03bbnn +1 i.

Every monomial ideal has a unique irredundant\nirreducible decomposition [13]. The irredundant irreducible decomposition of\nany monomial ideal can be obtained in terms of its Koszul homology. First we\ngive some preparatory results.\nLemma 3.1 Let x\u03bc a monomial and let C be the complement of supp(x\u03bc ) in\nthe set of all indeterminates. Then, for any monomial x\u03bd we have\n[\nx\u03bd \u2208\n/ m\u03bc \u21d0\u21d2 x\u03bd \u2208\nx\u03c1 * k[C]\nx\u03c1 |xlow(\u03bc)\n\nx\u03bd 6\u2208 m\u03bc .

Let us distinguish two cases:\nProposition 3.3 Let I be an artinian monomial ideal and let Bn\u22121 (I) the set\nof multidegrees in which I has nonzero (n \u2212 1)-st Koszul homology (i.e. the\nmaximal corners of I ). The irredundant irreducible decomposition of I is\n\\\nm\u03bc\nI=\n\u03bc\u2208Bn\u22121 (I)\n\n5\n\n\fProof:\nSince I is artinian R/I is a finite k-vector space, i.e. the set of\nstandard monomials is finite. Every standard monomial divides a maximal\nstandard monomial by definition, and the set of maximal standard monomials\nis given by the monomials xlow(\u03bc) such that \u03bc \u2208 Bn\u22121 (I).\nApplying now Corollary 3.2, we have thatSx\u03bd |xlow(\u03bc) \u21d0\u21d2 x\u03bd \u2208\n/ m\u03bc , therefore x\u03bd \u2208\n/ I \u21d0\u21d2 x\u03bd \u2208 R/I \u21d0\u21d2 x\u03bd \u2208\n/ \u03bc\u2208Bn\u22121 (I) m\u03bc i.e. x\u03bd \u2208 I \u21d0\u21d2\nT\nx\u03bd \u2208 \u03bc\u2208Bn\u22121 (I) m\u03bc and we have an irreducible decomposition of I. Since the\nelements in Bn\u22121 (I) do not divide each other, the decomposition is irredundant.\nProposition 3.4 Let I be a monomial ideal, I\u02c6 its artinian closure and \u03bb =\n\u03bb(I). The irredundant irreducible decomposition of I is given by\n(\n\\\n\u03bci if \u03bci \u2264 \u03bbi\n\u03bc\u0303\nI=\nm\nwhere \u03bc\u0303i =\n0 otherwise\n\u02c6\n\u03bc\u2208Bn\u22121 (I)\n\nProof:\nLet x\u03bc be a maximal corner of I\u02c6 and C\u03bc the set of indeterminates\nsuch that \u03bci \u2265 \u03bbi + 1.\nWe have from Lemma 3.1 that\n\\\n[\nx\u03c1 * k[C\u03bc ]\nx\u03bd \u2208\n/\nm\u03bc\u0303 \u21d0\u21d2 x\u03bd \u2208\n\u02c6\n\u03bc\u2208Bn\u22121 (I)\n\nx\u03c1 |xlow(\u03bc\u0303)\n\n\u02c6\n\u03bc\u2208Bn\u22121 (I)\n\nLet us call J the set on the right hand side of this equivalence.\n\u02c6 then clearly\nConsider now a monomial x\u03bd in J such that x\u03bd is not in I,\n\u03bd\nlow(\u03bc)\nx \u2208\n/ I. Observe that in particular x\n\u2208\n/ I.\n\u02c6 We have that x\u03bd is of the form x\u03c1 * k[C\u03bc ]\nTake then x\u03bd \u2208 J such that x\u03bd \u2208 I.\n\u02c6 Since x\u03bd \u2208 I,\n\u02c6 C\u03bc 6= \u2205, thus \u2203\u03bdi \u2264 \u03bbi + 1.\nwith x\u03c1 |xlow(\u03bc\u0303) for some \u03bc \u2208 Bn\u22121 (I).\n\u03bd\nAssume x \u2208 I, then there is some m \u2208 min(I) such that mi \u2264 \u03bdi for all i.\nIn particular mi \u2264 \u03bdi for all i \u2208\n/ C\u03bc \u21d2 m|xlow(\u03bc) \u21d2 xlow(\u03bc) \u2208 I which is a\ncontradiction.\nTherefore, J \u2286 R/I (the inclusion R/I \u2286 J is trivial), then J = R/I, or\nequivalently\n\\\nI=\nm\u03bc\u0303\n\u02c6\n\u03bc\u2208Bn\u22121 (I)\n\nExample 3.5 Given any monomial ideal I, a procedure is given in [12] to\nobtain the irredundant irreducible decomposition of I directly from its Koszul\nhomology. In this case one needs to know the multidegrees of the generators\nof every homology module (or the full minimal free resolution), not only the\n(n \u2212 1)-st module.\nExample 3.6 Consider the ideal I = hx3 y 5 z, y 5 z 4 , y 3 z 5 , xyz 5 , x2 z 5 , x4 z 3 , x4 y 2 z 2 , x4 y 4 zi.\nThe lcm of its minimal generators is \u03bb(I) = (x4 y 5 z 5 ). The maximal corners of\nI\u02c6 are x4 y 5 z 5 , x5 y 2 z 3 , x5 y 4 z 2 , x3 y 6 z 4 , x2 yz 6 , xy 3 z 6 and x5 y 6 z. Thus, we obtain\nthe irredundant irreducible decomposition:\nI = hx4 , y 5 , z 5 i \u2229 hy 2 , z 3 i \u2229 hy 4 , z 2 i \u2229 hx3 , z 4 i \u2229 hx2 , yi \u2229 hx, y 3 i \u2229 hzi\n\n6\n\n\f4\n\nKoszul homology and Stanley decompositions\n\nGiven an ideal I \u2286 R, the quotient ring R/I is a k-algebra. If I is a monomial\nring, the monomials in R/I can be seen as the complement of the monomials\nin I in the set of all monomials, and they form a k-vector space basis of R/I.\nWe call combinatorial decomposition of R/I to a representation of it as a finite\nsum of k-vector spaces of the form x\u03bc k[x\u03bc ] with x\u03bc \u2286 [x1 , . . . , xn ]. If the sum\nis direct we say it is a Stanley decomposition:\nM\nR/I =\nx\u03bc k[x\u03bc ]\n(4)\n\u03bc\u2208F\n\nn\n\nwhere F is a finite subset of N . Note that Stanley decompositions are not\nunique. Every ideal I \u2286 R has a Stanley decomposition. This type of decompositions provide information on some relevant invariants of R/I:\nProposition 4.1 (S78,SW91) Let (4) be a Stanley decomposition of R/I, and\nlet d be the maximum of the numbers |x\u03bc |, \u03bc \u2208 F . Then\n1. d is the Krull dimension of R/I.\n2. The Hilbert series of R/I is given by\nH(R/I; t) =\n\nX\n\n\u03bc\u2208F\n\nt|\u03bc|\n(1 \u2212 t)|x\u03bc |\n\nTo explain how to obtain Stanley decompositions of monomial ideals from\ntheir Koszul homology, we need some auxiliary concepts:\nDefinition 4.2 We say that a set of indeterminates {xj1 , . . . , xjk } is a cone of\nlocally free directions of the monomial x\u03bc with respect to I if \u03c4 = {j1 , . . . , jk } \u2208\n\u2206\u03bcI . The set of cones of locally free directions of x\u03bc will be denoted LFD(x\u03bc ),\nand is given by the facets of \u2206\u03bcI .\nWe say that a set of indeterminates {xj1 , . . . , xjk } is a cone of globally free\ndirections of the monomial x\u03bc \u2208\n/ I with respect to I if x\u03bc * x\u03c3 \u2208\n/ I for all\n\u03c3\nmonomials x \u2208 k[xj1 , . . . , xjk ]. The set of cones of globally free directions of\nx\u03bc will be denoted GFD(x\u03bc ). For x\u03bc \u2208 I we state GFD(x\u03bc ) := GFD(xlow(\u03bc) ).\nExample 4.3 Consider the ideal I = hx3 , x2 y, xz, y 3 , z 3 i.\nWe have that \u2206xyz\n= {{x}, {y}, {z}, {x, y}, {y, z}} thus, LFD(xyz) = {[x, y], [y, z]}.\nI\nHowever, GFD(xyz) = \u2205 since low(xyz) = 1 and 1 * x3 \u2208 I, 1 * y 3 \u2208 I and\n1 * z 3 \u2208 I.\nNote that if we consider instead I = hx2 y, xz, y 3 , z 3 i then LFD(xyz) remains\nunchanged, but GFD(xyz) = {[x]} since 1 * xp \u2208\n/ I for all p \u2265 0.\nWe can now proceed to describe how to obtain a Stanley decomposition of\na monomial ideal from its Koszul homology. We treat separately the artinian\nand non-artinian cases.\nProposition 4.4 Let I be an artinian monomial ideal. A Stanley decomposition of R/I is given by\nM\nk * x\u03bd\nR/I \u2243\nx\u03bd |xlow(\u03bc)\nx\u03bc \u2208Bn\u22121 (I)\n\n7\n\n\fProof:\nWe just need to remind the first part of the proof of Proposition\n3.3: Since I is artinian R/I is a finite k-vector space, i.e. the set of standard\nmonomials is finite. Every standard monomial divides a maximal standard\nmonomial by definition, and the set of maximal standard monomials is given by\nthe monomials xlow(\u03bc) such that \u03bc \u2208 Bn\u22121 (I).\nProposition 4.5 Let I a monomial ideal and let I\u02c6 its artinian closure. There\nis a procedure to obtain a Stanley decomposition of I form the (n \u2212 1)-st Koszul\n\u02c6\nhomology of I.\nProof:\n\nThe proof consists on a description of such procedure.\n\n1. First we compute the Stanley decomposition of R/I\u02c6 using the previous\nproposition. Since R/I\u02c6 \u2286 R/I, this is part of the Stanley decomposition\nof R/I, we call it the inner part of the decomposition.\n\u02c6 such that \u03bci \u2265 \u03bbi + 1 for some i \u2208 {1, . . . , n},\n2. Take now x\u03bc \u2208 Bn\u22121 (I)\nwhere \u03bb = \u03bb(I). We call points of the skeleton (of the decomposition of\n\u03c4\n*x\u03bc\nR/I) to the monomials xx1 ***x\nsuch that \u03c4 \u2208 \u2206I\u03bd and also to the monomials\nn\n\u03c4\n\u03bc\n*x\nin the nonfree directions of {x1 , . . . , xn } \\ \u03c4\nthat are divisors of xx1 ***x\nn\n3. To obtain the Stanley decomposition we add the cones of the points of the\nskeleton in all their free directions.\nObserve that if a point is a nonfree divisor of several points in the skeleton,\nthen all these point have the same free directions. To prove this, assume x\u03c1\ndivides both x\u03bc and x\u03bd and let GF D(x\u03bc ) be the set of free directions of x\u03bc\nand GF D(x\u03bd ) the set of free directions of x\u03bd . We know that GF D(x\u03bc ) \u2229\nsupp(\u03bc \u2212 \u03c1) = \u2205 and GF D(x\u03bd ) \u2229 supp(\u03bd \u2212 \u03c1) = \u2205. Assume now that there exists\ni \u2208 GF D(x\u03bc ) \u2212 GF D(x\u03bd ), then we must have \u03c1i = \u03bci = \u03bbi + 1 and \u03bdi < \u03bbi + 1\nand we have a contradiction, because in that case x\u03c1 would not be a divisor of\nx\u03bd .\nNow, let x\u03bc \u2208 R/I, then we can have two cases, first, if x\u03bc divides x\u03bb+1\n\u02c6 and from the first considerations above we know\nthen it is in the inner part of I,\nthat we have collected all the inner part of the Stanley decomposition of R/I.\nSecond, if x\u03bc does not divide x\u03bb+1 then exists i such that \u03bci > \u03bbi + 1, for each\nsuch i do \u03bc\u0304 = \u03bc \u2212 (\u03bci \u2212 \u03bbi + 1))i , and then we are back in the first case at a point\nin which all i are free directions, and we know it is in some of the considered\ncones.\n\n5\n\nAlgorithms\n\nWe present in this section an algorithm for computing irreducible decompositions of monomial ideals based on the correspondence between the irreducible\ncomponents of the monomial ideal I and the multidegrees in B(I). The algorithm is a modification of the one used to compute Koszul homology using\nMayer-Vietoris trees presented in [12].\nThe components of the irredundant irreducible decomposition of a monomial\nideal I also correspond to the minimal generators of its Alexander dual [8], to\nthe facets of its Scarf complex [9], and to the maximal standard monomials associated to I [11]. These correspondences have originated different algorithms for\n8\n\n\fthe computation of irredundant irreducible decompositions. The most relevant\nones are those proposed by Milowski [9], based on Alexander duals and Scarf\ncomplexes; and Roune, based on enumeration of maximal standard monomials\n[11]. This last approach is the closest to our approach by (n \u2212 1)-st Koszul\nhomology of I.\n\n5.1\n\nMayer-Vietoris trees\n\nGiven a monomial ideal I minimally generated by {m1 , . . . , mr }, we can construct an analogue of the well known Mayer-Vietoris sequence from topology, in\nthe following way:\nDefinition 5.1 For each 1 \u2264 s \u2264 r denote Is := hm1 , . . . ms i, I \u0303s := Is\u22121 \u2229\nhms i = hm1,s , . . . , ms\u22121,s i, where mi,j denotes lcm(mi , mj ). Then, for each s\nwe have\n\u2206\n\n\u2206\n\n* * * \u2212\u2192 Hi+1 (K(Is )) \u2212\u2192 Hi (K(I \u0303s ) \u2212\u2192 Hi (K(Is\u22121 )\u2295K(hms i)) \u2212\u2192 Hi (K(Is )) \u2212\u2192 * * *\n(5)\nand since the Koszul differential respects multidegrees, we also have a multigraded version of the sequence. The set of these sequences for each s is called\nthe (recursive) Mayer-Vietoris sequence of I.\nUsing recursively these exact sequences for every \u03bc \u2208 Nn we can compute the\nKoszul homology of I = hm1 , . . . , mr i. The involved ideals can be displayed as\na tree, the root of which is I and every node J has as children J \u0303 on the left and\nJ \u2032 on the right (if J is generated by r monomials, J \u0303 denotes J \u0303r and J \u2032 denotes\nJr\u22121 ). This is what we call a Mayer-Vietoris Tree of the monomial ideal I,\nand we will denote it MVT(I). Each node in a Mayer-Vietoris tree is given a\nposition: the root has position 1 and the left and right children of the node in\nposition p have respectively, positions 2p and 2p + 1. The node of MVT(I) in\nposition p is denoted MVTp (I). We assign also dimensions to the nodes: the\nroot has dimension 0, and the left and right children of the node of dimension\ni have respectively, dimensions i + 1 and i.\nExample 5.2 Strictly speaking, the definition of Mayer-Vietoris sequences of\nmonomial ideals is not fully precise, in the sense that the Mayer-Vietoris sequence associated to a given ideal is not uniquely defined, it depends on how\nthe minimal generators are sorted. The choice of the last generator of the ideal\nI to be the one which defines the Mayer-Vietoris sequence is just a matter of\nconvenience in notation. Several selection strategies can be applied to select the\ndistinguished generator.\nThe properties of Mayer-Vietoris trees allow us to perform Koszul homology\ncomputations, see the proofs of the following results in [12].\nProposition 5.3 If Hi,\u03bc (K(I)) 6= 0 for some i, then x\u03bc is a generator of some\nnode J in any Mayer-Vietoris tree MVT(I).\nThus, all the multidegrees of Koszul generators (equivalently Betti numbers)\nof I appear in MVT(I). For a sufficient condition, we need the following notation: among the nodes in MVT(I) we call relevant nodes those in an even\nposition or in position 1.\n9\n\n\fProposition 5.4 If x\u03bc appears only once as a generator of a relevant node\nJ in MVT(I) then there exists exactly one generator in H\u2217 (K(I)) which has\nmultidegree \u03bc.\nThe homological degree to which relevant multidegrees contribute, is just\nthe dimension of the node in which they appear.\nLet I be a monomial ideal and MVT(I) a Mayer-Vietoris tree of I. Let\n\u03bc \u2208 Nn ; let \u03b2 i,\u03bc (I) = 1 if \u03bc is the multidegree of some non repeated generator\nin some relevant node of dimension i in MVT(I) and \u03b2 i,\u03bc (I) = 0 in other\ncase. Let \u03b2bi,\u03bc (I) be the number of times \u03b1 appears as the multidegree of some\ngenerator of dimension i in some relevant node in MVT(I). Then for all \u03bc \u2208 Nn\nwe have\n\n5.2\n\n\u03b2 i,\u03bc (I) \u2264 \u03b2i,\u03bc (I) \u2264 \u03b2bi,\u03bc (I).\n\nMayer-Vietoris computation of Bn\u22121\n\nIf we have a monomial ideal with r minimal generators, we know that projdim(I) \u2264\nr \u2212 1 (to see this just consider the length of the well known Taylor resolution, for\ninstance), therefore to have Hn\u22121 (I) 6= 0 we need at least n generators. Using\nthis simple argument, we can prune the Mayer-Vietoris tree of I in the following\nway: Do not consider all subtrees hanging of nodes with a number of generators\nless than n \u2212 i where i is the dimension of the node. We compute the pruned\ntree and store the generators of all nodes of dimension n \u2212 1. This is what we\ncall pruning by number of generators.\nWhen we reach a node of MVT(I) such that the union of the supports of\nits generators is strictly contained in {1, . . . , n} then it is clear that there is\nno (n \u2212 1)-st Koszul homology in the subtree hanging from this node, for all\nmaximal corners have full support, therefore, we do not consider this subtree.\nThis is what we call prunning by number of indeterminates.\nExample 5.5 Another modification we can apply to the general MVT algorithm\nis the following: Consider that we always sort the generators of the nodes in the\ntree according to the lexicographic term order. Then it is clear that the first\ngenerator will have highest exponent in the first indeterminate, we take this as\npivot monomial. If the first indeterminate is not x1 we can prune the tree by\nnumber of indeterminates. If it is x1 then all generators of the left child of the\nnode will have the same exponent in the first indeterminate, since we take least\ncommon multiples for its construction. Therefore, we can consider the node\nas an ideal in a ring with one fewer indeterminate. Reducing the number of\nindeterminates, we will have that all our nodes will be considered as ideals in\ntwo indeterminates, and here the computation of the (n \u2212 1)-st Koszul homology\nis straightforward.\nAfter performing these prunnings we have a set of multidegrees that are\ncandidates to be in Bn\u22121 (I). For each of them we check whether they have\nhomology or not based on the caracterization given in examples 2.2 and 2.7, i.e.\nwe just check whether\nxi * x\u03bc\n\u2208 I \u2200i\nx1 * * * xn\n\nand\n10\n\nx\u03bc\n\u2208\n/I\nx1 * * * xn\n\n\f|min(I)|\n40\n80\n120\n160\n200\n\nTable 1: Random generic ideals in ten indeterminates\n|irr(I)|\nMacaulay2 Monos(Alex.)

On the other hand, the x indeterminate\nis not present in the generators of MVT3 (I) hence we can prune this branch by\nnumber of indeterminates. Therefore, after one iteration of our algorithm we\nobtain Bn\u22121 (I) = \u2205.\n\n5.3\n\nComparison with other algorithms\n\nWe present here some tables to show the performance of an implementation of\nthe described algorithm using the C++ library CoCoALib[3] which is part of the\ncomputer algebra system CoCoA[2]. The Tables show the timings of several different algorithms computing irreducible decompositions of monomial ideals on\nsome benchmark examples. The examples and timings are taken from [11], except those corresponding to the Mayer-Vietoris algorithm. Although the tested\nimplementation is not fully optimized to achieve time efficiency, the tables illustrate the fact that the algorithm based on Koszul homology computation has\ngood performance when compared with the algorithms existing in the literature.\nThis is remarkable since the algortihm we present is a simple modification of\na more general algorithm, while the others are algorithms specifically designed\nfor the computation of irreducible decomposition. In the Tables |irr(I)| gives\nthe number of minimal generators of I, |irr(I)| and is the number of irreducible\ncomponents of I. The column Macaulay2 shows the timings of the computation\nusing the computer algebra system Macaulay2 [5], the columns Monos correspond to the program Monos by R.A. Milowski [9] either using the Alexander\ndual or the Scarf complex approach, and the column Frobby corresponds to the\nSlice algorithm by B.

In particular we\nhave showed that the (n \u2212 1)-st Koszul homology of a monomial ideal I provides\nthe irredundant irreducible decomposition of I (or equivalently its Alexander\ndual, set of maximal standard monomials,...) and a Stanley decomposition of\nR/I. These facts allow us to produce algorithm to make computations on monomial ideals based on the computation of its Koszul homology. This has been\nillustrated by the computation of the irreducible decomposition of a monomial\nideal using a specialization of the Mayer-Vietoris tree algorithm, showing good\nperformance in practice.\nFuture work includes the exploration of further relations between algebraic\nand homological descriptions and properties of monomial ideals, based on their\ncombinatorial nature. Also the application of this homological approach to other\nalgebraic combinatoric objects is an open line of research already followed by\ndifferent authors, see as good examples [8] and [10]. Finally, the improvement of\nthe algorithms presented in this paper and the implementation of new algorithms\nto perform computations on monomial ideals is another direction for future work\nalready in progress by the authors.\nAknowledgements: The authors want to thank Werner M.
