INTRODUCTION\nTranslocation of biopolymers through a pore embedded in a membrane is a fundamental step in a variety\nof biological processes. Among the examples are the\ntranslocation of some species of m-RNA through the nucleus membrane which is the first stage of gene expression in eucaryotic cells [1], and the attack of cells by\nviruses that occurs by injecting the genetic information\nthrough a hole in the cell membrane [2]. The translocation importance in bio-systems, and the possibility for\ndeveloping fast sequencing methods, have been the motivation for recent experiments, in which a voltage-driven\nssDNA is translocated through \u03b1-hemolysin channel of\na known structure [3]. In these experiments one measures the time it takes a single ssDNA molecule to pass\nthrough a membrane channel [4-7]. Since ssDNA is negatively charged (each monomer has an effective charge of\nzq, where z (0 < z < 1 ) is controlled by the solution\npH and strength), when applying a voltage the polymer\nis subject to a driving force while passing through the\nmembrane from the negative (cis) side to the positive\n(trans) side. Because the presence of the ssDNA in the\ntransmembrane pore part (TPP) blocks the cross-TPP\ncurrent, one can deduce the translocation times pdf from\nthe current blockade duration times [4-7]. It has been\nfound that the shape of the translocation times pdf is\ncontrolled not only by the voltage applied to the system,\nthe temperature and the polymer length but also by the\nnature of the homo-polymer used: poly-dA (A-adenine);\npoly-dC (C-cytosine); poly-Tnu (Tnu -thymine), and the\nsequence of hetro-polymers [4-7].\nThe translocation process can be roughly divided into\ntwo stages. The first stage is the arrival of the polymer\nin the vicinity of the pore and the second stage is the\ntranslocation itself. Several models have been suggested\nfor describing the translocation stage. In [8] an equation\nfor the free energy of the translocation, obtained from\nthe partition functions of the polymer parts outside the\n\nTPP, was derived and used to calculate the mean first\npassage time (MFPT). Other investigators used similar\nideas with improved free energy terms by taking into consideration effects such as the membrane width [9-10], or\nassumed that only the part of the ssDNA inside the TPP\naffects the dynamics of the translocation rather than the\npolymer parts outside the TPP [11-12].\nIn this work we present a new theoretical approach\nthat allows to consider both the polymer parts outside\nthe TPP and within the TPP. Using the ME we are able\nto map the three dimensional translocation onto a discrete space one-dimensional process. Based on the ME\nwe compute the pdf of the first passage times (FPT) of the\ntranslocation, F (t), and the MFPT, as a function of the\nsystem parameters. We relate our theoretical results to\nrecent experimental observations and by analyzing them\nusing our model, we come up with physical understanding of these observations.\n2. THE MODEL\nAn n(= N + d \u2212 1)-state ME is used to describe the\ntranslocation of an N -monomer long ssDNA subject to\nan external voltage V , and temperature T , through a\nTPP of a length that corresponds to d(= 12) monomers.\nA state is defined by the number of monomers on each\nside of the membrane and within the TPP. A change in\nthe state of the system (only nearest states transitions are\nallowed) is assumed to be controlled mainly by the behavior of the polymer within the TPP in the presence of\nthe applied voltage. In addition, it is assumed to be influenced by entropic and interaction factors of the polymer\noutside and within the TPP. Absorbing ends are used\nas boundary conditions, which are the natural choice for\nthis system because the polymer can exit the TPP on\nboth sides. The state j = n represents the arrival of\nthe first monomer into the TPP from the cis side, and\nthe state j = 0 represents the departure of the far end\nmonomer from the trans side of the TPP. Let Pj (t) be\nthe pdf of state j that contains mj nucleotides occupying\n\n\f2\nthe TPP according to:\n\uf8f1\nj,\nj\u2264d\n\uf8f2\nd,\nN > j > d given N \u2265 d,\nmj =\n\uf8f3\nn + 1 \u2212 j,\nj\u2265N\n\n(1.1)\n(1.2)\n(1.3)\n\nand a similar set of equations for a short polymer, N \u2264 d,\nwhich is obtained by exchanging N and d in Eqs.(1.1)\nthrough (1.3). The governing equations of motion are:\n\u2202Pj (t)/\u2202t = aj+1,j Pj+1 (t) + aj\u22121,j Pj\u22121 (t)\n\u2212(aj,j+1 + aj,j\u22121 )Pj (t); j = 2, * * *, n \u2212 1,\n\u2202Py (t)/\u2202t = ay+1,y Py+1 (t)\u03b4y,1 + ay\u22121,y Py\u22121 (t)\u03b4y,n\n\u2212(ay,y\u22121 + ay,y+1 )Py (t); y = 1, n.\n\n(2)\n\nEquations (2) can be written in matrix representation\n\u2192\n\u2212\n\u2192\n\u2212\n\u2202 P /\u2202t = A P . The propagation matrix A, is a tridiagonal matrix that contains information about the transitions between states in term of rate constants. We assume that the rate constants can be decoupled into two\nterms:\naj,j+/\u22121 = kj (T )pj,j+/\u22121 (V, T ).\n\n(3)\n\nThe first term provides the rate to perform a step, while\nthe second term gives the probability to jump from state\nj in a given direction, and obeys: pj,j+1 + pj,j\u22121 = 1. To\nobtain kj , we first consider the bulk relaxation time of a\npolymer [13] \u03c4b \u221d \u03b2\u03beb b2 N \u03bc , where \u03b2 \u22121 = kB T , b is a\nmonomer length, \u03beb is the Stokes bulk friction constant\nper segment, \u03beb = 6\u03c0b\u03b7 (where \u03b7 is the solvent viscosity),\nN is the number of monomers in the polymer and the\ndimensions dependant \u03bc represents the effect of the microscopic repulsion on the average polymer size. In three\ndimensions \u03bc = 3, 9/5, 3/2 for rod-like, self-avoiding and\nGaussian (Zimm model) chains, respectively. To compute the relaxation time inside the TPP, the confined\nvolume of the TPP must be taken into account. For\na rod-like polymer the restricted volume dictates a onedimensional translocation, whereas for a flexible polymer\nthe limitations are less restricted. We implement this by\ntaking \u03bc as a measure of the polymer stiffness inside the\nTPP that obeys: 0 \u2264 \u03bc \u2264 1.5. The expression for the\nrelaxation rate of state j is therefore,\nkj = 1/(\u03b2\u03bep b2 m\u03bcj ) \u2261 R/m\u03bcj .\n\n(4)\n\nFrom Eq.(4) it is clear that as \u03bc becomes smaller the\nrate to preform a step becomes larger, namely kj for a\nrod-like polymer increases. This feature appears, at first\nsight, to be in contradiction to the relaxation time behavior of a bulk polymer, where a rod-like polymer has\na larger relaxation time than that of a flexible polymer.\nThis contradiction is resolved by taking into account the\ndifferent dimensional demand for a rod-like polymer relative to a flexible polymer inside the TPP. Because \u03bc is\na measure of the polymer stiffness inside the TPP, it is\n\ncontrolled by the interaction between the monomers occupying the TPP, e.g base stacking and hydrogen bonds,\nand therefore is affected by the monomer type and the\nsequence of the ssDNA.\nThe friction constant per segment inside the TPP, \u03bep ,\nrepresents the interaction between the ssDNA and the\nTPP. The physical picture is that during translocation\nthere are few or no water molecules between the polymer\nand the TPP. Consequently the water molecules inside\nthe TPP can hardly be viewed as the conventional solvent and the Stokes friction constant is replaced by \u03bep\nrepresenting the ssDNA-TPP interaction.\nTo calculate pj,j\u22121 , the second term on the right hand\nside of Eq.(3), we assume a quasi-equilibrium process and\nuse the detailed balance condition for the ratio of the rate\nconstants between neighboring states: aj,j\u22121 /aj\u22121,j =\ne\u2212\u03b2\u2206Ej , where \u2206Ej = Ej\u22121 \u2212 Ej . We then use the\napproximation aj,j\u22121 /aj\u22121,j \u2248 pj,j\u22121 /(1 \u2212 pj,j\u22121 ), and\ndeduce the jump probabilities by computing \u2206Ej . To\ncompute Ej the contributions from three different sources\nare considered: electrostatic, Ejp , entropic, Ejs , and an\naveraged interaction energy between the ssDNA and the\npore, Eji .\nFor the calculations of the electrostatic energy difference between adjacent states, \u2206Ejp , we assume a linear\ndrop of the voltage along the TPP and write for mj\nmonomers occupying the TPP penetrating from the cis\nside of the membrane for a length of ij b:\nmj +ij \u22121\n\nEjp = zq(V /d)\n\nX\n\nn = zq(V /2d)mj (mj + 2ij \u2212 1).\n\nn=ij\n\n(5)\nThe effective charge per monomer in the TPP is taken\nto be the same as of the bulk. For states that contain\nmonomers at the trans side of the membrane, zqV should\nbe added for \u2206Ejp . This contribution represents the additional effective charge that passed through the potential\nV . Accordingly, the expression for \u2206Ejp is (see Appendix\nA):\n\u2206Ejp = zqV (mj + \u03b1j )/d.\n\n(6)\n\nHere \u03b1j takes the values: \u03b1j = {\u22121; 0; 1} for cases\ndescribed by equations {(1.1); (1.2); (1.3)} respectively\n(\u03b1j = 1 and \u03b1j = \u22121 correspond to the entrance and\nexit states of the translocation, whereas \u03b1j = 0 corresponds to the intermediate states of the translocation).\nFor a short polymer, \u03b1j has the same values as for a large\npolymer.\nThe contribution to \u2206Ej from \u2206Ejs is composed of\ntwo terms. One term is the entropic cost needed to store\nmj monomers inside the TPP, and the second term originates from the reduced number of configurations of a\nGaussian polymer near an impermeable wall. Combining these terms leads to (see Appendix B):\n\u2206Ejs = \u03b3j /\u03b2,\n\n(7)\n\n\f3\n\n\u2206Eji = \u03b6j /\u03b2,\n\np\n\n(9)\n\nFor the system to be voltage driven \u03b2|\u2206Ejp | > \u03b4j must be\nfulfilled, which translate into the condition: V /VC > 1,\nwhere a characteristic voltage is introduced: VC\u22121 \u2261\n(1 + 1/d)\u03b2z|q|. This inequality ensures that there is a\nbias towards the trans side of the membrane. Otherwise\nthe polymer is more likely to exit from the same side it\nentered than to transverse the membrane. Under experimental conditions [6] VC = 46mV , when using z \u2248 1/2.\nIn Figure 1 we show the different contributions to \u2206Ej :\n\u03b2\u2206Ejp (for \u03b2z|q|V =1) and \u03b4j . \u03b2\u2206Ejp decreases for the\nentrance states of the translocation, increases at the exit\nstates of the translocation, and is a negative constant\nfor intermediate states. Clearly \u03b2\u2206Ejp \u2264 0 reflects the\nfield directionality. On the other hand, \u03b4j opposes the\ntranslocation for the entrance and intermediate states.\nFor the entrance states \u03b4j > 0 due to both entropic terms,\nbut approaches zero (from below) for the exit states of the\ntranslocation, due to the cancellation of \u2206Eji against the\nentropic gain of storing less monomers within the TPP.\nAt intermediate states \u03b4j \u2248 1, where its shape near the\ncrossover between the different situations is controlled by\ngj .\n3.

For a short polymer \u03b3j behaves similarly\nbut for intermediate states gj =0.\nFor computing \u2206Eji we focus on the average interaction between the ssDNA and pore (not only its transmembrane part). Due to the asymmetry of the pore\nbetween the cis and the tran sides of the membrane\n[3], the ssDNA interacts with the pore on the cis side\nof the membrane and within the TPP but not on the\ntrans side of the membrane. Assuming an attractive\ninteraction, Eji = \u2212kB T (N \u2212 Nj,trans ) (more properly,\nEji = \u2212\u03b5(N \u2212 Nj,trans ), and we set \u01eb = kB T in the relevant temperature regime) we obtain:\n\n(10)\n\nwhere the survival probability, namely, the probability to\nhave at least one monomer in the TPP, S(t), is the sum\nover all states pdf\n\u2192\n\u2212\n\u2192\n\u2212\n(11)\nS(t) = U CeDt C\u22121 P 0 .\n\u2192\n\u2212\nHere U is the summation row vector of n dimensions,\n\u2192\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\u2192\nP 0 is the initial condition column vector, ( P 0 )j = \u03b4x,j ,\nwhere x is the initial state, and the definite negative real\npart eigenvalue matrix, D, is obtained through the transformation: D = C\u22121 AC.\nSubstituting Eq.(11) into Eq.(10), F (t) is obtained.\nFigure 2 shows the double-peaked F (t) behavior as a\nfunction of V /VC and N (inset), for starting at x =\nN + d/4. The left peak represents the non-translocated\nevents. Its amplitude decreases as V /VC increases but\nremains unchanged (along with the position) with the increase in N , because only the 'head' of the polymer is involved in these events. As x decreases, namely when the\ntranslocation initial state shifts towards the trans side,\nthe non-translocation peak and the translocation peak\nmerge and for x = n/2, namely, for an initial condition\nfor which Nj,cis =Nj,trans , F (t) has one peak (data not\nshown) independent of V /VC .\nFor a convenient comparison to experimental results,\nwe calculate and examine the behavior of the most probable average translocation velocity, v = xb/tm , where tm\nis the time that maximizes the translocation peak.\nF igure 3 shows the v(N ) behavior, for V /VC =\n2.60. v(N ) is a monotoniaclly decreasing function of N\nfor N \u2264 d, but is independent of N for N \u2265 d. This\nagrees with the experimental results [6]. The origin for\nv(N ) behavior, stems from Eqs.(1) and (4), according to\nwhich the minimal kj is a decreasing monotonic function\nof N for N \u2264 d, but is independent of N for N \u2265 d.\nThe velocity, v(V ), depends on x, v(V ) = vx (V ), and\nchanges from a linear to quadratic function of the voltage\nwhen changing x, as shown in the inset of f igure 3, for\nN = 30.\n\n\f4\n\u22123\n\n1.2\n\nx 10\n\n0.4\n\nV/VC=1.3\nV/VC=1.7\nV/VC=2.3\n\nN=30\nN=40\nN=50\n\nF(t)\n\n10\n5\n\n1\n\nv(V) (A\u00b0/\u03bcs)\n\n15\n\n1.5\nF(t)\n\n1\n\nv(N) (A\u00b0/\u03bcs)\n\n2\n\n\u22124\n\nx 10\n\n0.8\n\n0.6\n\n0.3\n0.2\n0.1\n0\n1.5\n\n0\n0\n\n0.5\n\n2000\nt(\u03bcs)\n\n2000\nt(\u03bcs)\n\n3000\n\n2\n\n4000\n\nFIG. 2: F (t), for several values of V /VC , with: N =30, x=N +\nd/4, z \u2248 1/2, T =2o C, VC =46mV , \u03bc=1.14 and R=106 Hz.\nThe left peak represents the non-translocated events, whereas\nthe right peak represents the translocation.

The MFPT\nStarting at x = N + 1, a linear scaling is obtained:\nvN +1 (V ) = b1 (V \u2212 b2 /b1 ). The coefficient b2 /b1 can be\n\u22121\n\u2261\nidentified as an effective characteristic voltage: Vf\nC\n(1 + 1/d)\u03b2e\nz |q| = b1 /b2 . From the last equality ze can be\nextracted.\nStarting at x = N/2, i.e. when initial state is close\nto the exit states, a square dependence is obtained:\nvN/2 (V ) = c1 (V \u2212 c2 )2 + c3 , with c1 = o(10\u22125 ), c2 =\n40mV and c3 = o(10\u22122 ). These coefficients are similar\nto the measured values [6].\nWe note that both linear and square scaling behaviors have been observed experimentally [4,6]. A possible\nexplanation for the different functional behavior of v(V )\nmight originate from different data analysis that can be\ninterpreted as having a different initial condition.\nTo get numerical values for \u03bep and \u03bc, we use\nthe experimental data in refs.\n[6-7], and obtain: \u03bc(C) = 1, \u03bc(A) = 1.14, \u03bc(Tnu ) = 1.28, and\n\u03bep (A) \u2248 10\u22124 meV s/nm2 , \u03bep (C) = \u03bep (Tnu ) = \u03bep (A)/3.\nFrom these values we find the limit in which the relaxation time of the polymer parts outside the TPP can\nbe neglected. We estimate the maximal bulk number\nof monomers, Nmax , for which the bulk relaxation\ntime is much shorter (5%) than of the TPP relaxation time. For a poly-dA bulk Zimm chain we get\nNmax \u2248 271, by taking for the viscosity the value\nfor water at 2o C, \u03b7 \u2248 1.7 * 10\u22123 N s/m2 . Using this\nvalue, \u03beb can be calculated from the Stokes relation\nto be: \u03beb \u2248 10\u22127 meV s/nm2 , which is three order of\nmagnitude smaller than \u03bep .\n\nAdditional information about the translocation can be\nobtained by computing the MFPT, \u03c4 . To compute an\nanalytical expression for \u03c4 , we consider a large polymer,\nN > d, and replace pj,j\u22121 and kj by state independent\nterms: p+ = [1 + e(\u2212V /VC +1) ]\u22121 , valid for x \u2248 N , and\nk = 1/(\u03b2\u03bep b2 d\u03bc ). This leads to a+ = p+ k and a\u2212 =\n(1\u2212p+ )k, which defines a one dimensional state invariant\nrandom walk.\nis obtained by inverting A\nR \u221e The MFPT\u2212\n\u2192\n\u2192\n\u2212\n[14]: \u03c4 = 0 tF (t)dt = \u2212 U A\u22121 P 0 . The calculations\nof the elements of the state independent A\u22121 yields (see\nAppendix C):\n(\u2212A\u22121 )s,x =\n\n\u2206(ps )\u2206(pn+1\u2212x ) px\u2212s\n+\n;\n\u2206(p)\u2206(pn+1 )\nk\n\ns < x, (12)\n\nm\n\u22121\nwhere \u2206(pm ) = pm\n)s,x for s \u2265 x is\n+ \u2212 p\u2212 and (\u2212A\nobtained when exchanging s with x and p+ with p\u2212 in\nEq.(12). Summing the x column elements of (\u2212A\u22121 ) we\nobtain \u03c4 (see Appendix C):\n\n\u03c4=\n\n\u2206(pn+1\u2212x )px+ x \u2212 \u2206(px )pn+1\u2212x\n(n + 1 \u2212 x)\n\u2212\n,\nn+1\nk\u2206(p)\u2206(p\n)\n\n(13)\n\nwhich in the limit of a weak bias, V /VC >\n\u223c 1, can be\nrewritten as (see Appendix C)\n\u03c4\u2248\n\n2x\u03bep b2 d\u03bc\n1\n.\nz|q|(1 + 1/d) V \u2212 VC\n\n(14)\n\nAlthough \u03c4 and tm are different characteristics of F (t)\nand differ significantly when slow translocation events\ndominate, Eq.(14) captures the linear scaling with\n\n\f5\nN and 1/V . The quadratic scaling of tm with 1/V\nis obtained when using Eq.(9) rather than its state\ninvariant version, for starting at, or near, an initial state\nfor which \u03b4j=x \u2264 0.\n3.iii. The sequence effect\nUnder the assumptions that are presented below, we\nnow construct \u03bep and \u03bc for every ssDNA sequence and\nthus examine the sequence effect on tm . For a given ssDNA sequence occupying the TPP in the j state, we write\nan expression for the average friction of that state, \u03bep,j ,\nassuming additive contributions of the monomers inside\nthe TPP:\nmj\n\n\u03bep,j = (1/mj )\n\nX\n\n\u03bep (nus ).\n\n(15)\n\ns=1\n\nHere nus stands for the nucleotide s occupying the\nTPP. To construct a compatible state dependent stiffness parameter, \u03bcj , we first argue that only nearest\nmonomers can interact inside the TPP and thus contributes to the rigidity of the polymer, which in turn\nincreases kj . We then examine the chemical structure\nof the nucleotides and look for 'hydrogen-like' bonds between adjacent bases. The term 'hydrogen-like' bonds\nis used because the actual distance between the atoms\nthat create the interaction may be larger than of a typical hydrogen bond. The pairs AA and CC can interact\nbut not the pairs Tnu Tnu and CA. For the pair CTnu\nthe interaction is orientation dependent; namely, for the\nl pairs sequence, poly-d(CTnu )l , the interaction is within\neach of the pairs but not between the pairs. Accordingly\nwe have: \u03bc(nu nu) = \u03bc(nu), \u03bc(CA) = \u03bc(AC) = \u03bc(Tnu ),\n\u03bc(CTnu ) = \u03bc(C), \u03bc(Tnu C) = \u03bc(Tnu ), which allow the\n3000\n\n2500\n\ntm(\u03bcs)\n\n2000\n\n1500\n\ndC \u2192 dA\ndC \u2192 dT\n\n1000\n\n500\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n60\n%dA,%dT\n\n80\n\n100\n\nFIG. 4: tm as a function of the percentage of equally spaced\nmonomers substitutions C \u2192 A and C \u2192 Tnu , for N = 60,\nx = N , z \u2248 1/2, V /VC = 1.63 and T = 292o K.

Figure 4 shows tm as a function of\nequally spaced substitutions C \u2192 Tnu and C \u2192 A. The\nlinear scaling of tm (C \u2192 Tnu ) is due to the linear scaling\nof \u03bcj (C \u2192 Tnu ). The saturating behavior of tm (C \u2192\nA) is a combination of two opposing factors: the linear\nscaling of \u03bep,j (C \u2192 A) and the nonmonotonic behavior of\n\u03bcj (C \u2192 A). Our model also predicts that for sufficiently\nlarge l\ntm [(CA)l ] > tm (Cl Al ).\n\n(17)\n\nThis feature is explained by noticing that\n2tm [(CA)l ] > tm (C2l ) + tm (A2l ), see figure 4, which follows from the expression for \u03bcj , Eq.(16), and then using\n2tm (Cn An ) \u2248 tm (C2l ) + tm (A2l ), which follows from\nthe linear scaling of tm with N , for N \u2265 d in addition\nto Eq.(15). The above findings regarding the behavior of tm for hetro-ssDNA, fit the experimental results [7].\n4. CONCLUSIONS\nIn the presented model, the translocation of ssDNA\nthrough \u03b1-hemolysin channel is controlled, in addition to\nthe voltage, by the interaction between the polymer and\nthe pore (\u2206Eji and \u03bep ), and between nearest monomers\ninside the TPP (\u03bc), as well as by an entropic factors\noriginate from polymer segments outside and within the\nTPP. Based on the model, we showed that F (t) can be\nmono or double peaked depending on x and V /VC . We\ncalculated the MFPT to be: \u03c4 \u223c N/(V \u2212 VC ), for N > d\nand V /VC >\n\u223c 1, and tm \u223c N/vx (V ) for N \u2265 d, where\nvx (V ) changes from a linear to a quadratic function of\nV with x. In addition we estimated that \u03bep \u2248 103 \u03beb ,\nand by constructing \u03bep and \u03bc for hetro-ssDNA explained\nexperimental results regarding the various behaviors of\ntm for hetro-ssDNA.\nAn extended version of this model that describes\ntranslocation through a fluctuating channel structure,\ncan be used to describe unbiased translocation, which\ndisplays long escape times [16]. Translocation of other\npolymers through proteins channels can be described using the same framework by changing \u03bc, \u03bep and \u2206Ej .\nAcknowledgements: we acknowledge fruitful discussions with Amit Meller and with Ralf Metzler and the\nsupport of the US-Israel Binational Science Foundation and the Tel Aviv University Nanotechnology Center.\nAPPENDIX A\nWe wish to calculate the electrostatic energy difference between sates, \u2206Ejp . There are three cases during translocation, which are described by Eqs.(1.1)-(1.3).\n\n\f6\nFor any polymer length, Eq.(1.1)(exit states) describes a\ncase for which Nj,cis =0 and Eq.(1.3) (entrance states)\ndescribes a case for which Nj,trans =0. For the case\ndescribed by Eq.(1.2) (intermediate states), there are\nmonomers on both sides of the membrane for a large\npolymer, or no monomers on both sides of the membrane\nfor a short polymer. Starting from Eq.(5) we have for the\nentrance states:\n\u2206Ejp =\n\nzqV (mj + 1)\n.\nd\n\n(A1)\n\nFor the exit states \u2206Ejp is composed of two contributions.\nOne contribution stems from the passage of a monomer\nwith an effective charge of zq through the potential V :\np\n\u2206Ej,1\n= zqV.\n\n(A2)\n\nThe second contribution calculated from Eq.(5) is:\np\n\u2206Ej,2\n=\n\n\u2212ij zqV\n.\nd\n\n(A3)\n\nCombining the two contributions we find\n\u2206Ejp =\n\n(d \u2212 ij )zqV\n(mj \u2212 1)zqV\n=\n,\nd\nd\n\n(A4)\n\nwhen using mj = d + 1 \u2212 ij .\nFor the intermediate states and a large polymer, we\nhave only the contribution given by Eq.(A2) (the number\nof monomers within the TPP is constant), which can be\nwritten as:\n\u2206Ejp =\n\nmj zqV\n,\nd\n\ns\n\u2206Ej,1\n\u221d kB T,\n\n(B3)\n\nwhile for the exit states\ns\n\u2206Ej,1\n\u221d \u2212kB T,\n\n(B4)\n\nwith a proportional constant of o(1).\ns\nFor the intermediate states \u2206Ej,1\n= 0 because the\nsame number of monomers occupy the TPP between ads\njacent states. \u2206Ej,1\nfor a short polymer has the same\nvalues as for a large polymer, when adjusting the conditions for the three cases (exchanging N and d in Eqs.(1)).\ns\nComputing \u2206Ej,2\nfrom Eq.(B2) results in 21 kB T gj ,\nwhere\n\uf8f1\nj \u2264 d;\n\uf8f2 ln(1 + 1/(N \u2212 j)),\ngj = ln(1 + 1/(N \u2212 j))(1 \u2212 1/(j \u2212 d)), N > j > d;\n\uf8f3\nln(1 \u2212 1/(j \u2212 d)),\nj \u2265 N.\n(B5)\nFor a short polymer, gj is similar to Eq.(B5) for the\nentrance and exit states, but gj = 0 for the intermediate\nstates because Nj,cis =Nj,trans =0 for these states. Note\nthat |gj | < 1 for all j. Special care is needed when computing gj for states that belong to the crossover between\nthe three situations. For these states a combination of\nEqs.(B2) was used. From the above contributions we\nobtain Eq.(7).\nAPPENDIX C\n\n(A5)\n\nwhen using mj = d which holds for the intermediate\nstates.
