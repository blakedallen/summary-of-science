The\noriginal SW algorithm can be modified to work for spin systems with internal symmetry\nbreaking fields8 . Spin models of this kind include the Ising antiferromagnet in a uniform\nfield, the random field Ising model and lattice gas models of adsorption in porous media9 .\nThe modification proposed in Ref. 8 is to assign Boltzmann weights depending on the net\nfield acting on the cluster to decide whether the cluster should be flipped. Unfortunately, the\nmodified SW algorithm is not efficient. The problem is that large clusters of spins usually\nhave a large net field acting on them and are prevented from flipping by these fields. An\nalgorithm for Ising systems with fields that avoids this problem was introduced by Redner,\nMachta, and Chayes10,11 . In this two-replica cluster algorithm large clusters are constructed\nfrom two replicas of the same system and have no net field acting on them so that they\nmay be freely flipped. The two-replica cluster algorithm has been applied to study the\nphase transition of benzene adsorbed in zeolites9 and is more efficient than the conventional\nMetropolis algorithm for locating and simulating the critical point and the phase coexistence\nline. Combined with the replica exchange method of Swendsen and Wang12 , the two-replica\nmethod has been applied to the random field Ising model13 . The two-replica method is\nclosely related to the geometric cluster Monte Carlo method14,15,16 .\nIn this paper, we report on a detailed investigation of the dynamics of the two-replica\ncluster (TRC) algorithm as applied to the two-dimensional Ising ferromagnetic in a staggered field (equivalently, the Ising antiferromagnet in a uniform field). The TRC algorithm\nintroduced in Ref. 10 has two components that are not required for detailed balance and ergodicity. We studied the contribution to the performance of the algorithm of these optional\ncomponents. We find that the complete TRC algorithm has a very small dynamic exponent z < 0.4. However, we also find that this small value of z requires one of the optional\ncomponents and that this component depends on a special symmetry of Ising model in a\nstaggered field. This observation leads to the question of whether cluster methods exist for\nefficiently simulating more general Ising models with fields. We investigated other optional\ncomponents for the algorithm but these do not lead to acceleration when fields are present.\nThis paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II we introduce the Ising model in a staggered\n2\n\n\ffield and describe the TRC algorithm. In Sec. III we define the quantities to be measured\nand how errors are computed. In Sec. IV we present the results. The paper closes in Sec. V\nwith a discussion.\n\nII.\n\nTHE MODEL AND TWO-REPLICA ALGORITHM\nA.\n\nIsing Model in a Staggered Field\n\nThe Hamiltonian for the Ising model in a staggered field is\n\u03b2H[\u03c3] = \u2212K\n\nX\n\n\u03c3i \u03c3j \u2212\n\nX\n\n<i,j>\n\nHi \u03c3i\n\n(1)\n\ni\n\nwhere the spin variables, \u03c3i take the values \u00b11. K is the coupling strength and Hi is the\nmagnetic field at site i. The summation in the first term of Eq. (1) is over nearest neighbors\non an L \u00d7 L square lattice with periodic boundary conditions and L even. The second\nsummation is over the sites of the lattice. The staggered field is obtained by setting Hi = H\nif i is in the even sublattice and Hi = \u2212H if i is in the odd sublattice. The staggered\nfield breaks the up-down symmetry(\u03c3i \u2190 \u2212\u03c3i ) of the zero field Ising model, however two\nsymmetries remain. The Hamiltonian is invariant under even translations:\n\u03c3i+r0 \u2190 \u03c3i for all i\n\n(2)\n\nwith r0 any vector in the even sublattice. The Hamiltonian is also invariant under odd\ntranslations together with a global flip:\n\u03c3i+r1 \u2190 \u2212\u03c3i for all i\n\n(3)\n\nwith r1 any vector in the odd sublattice.\nFigure 1 shows the line of critical points, Kc (H) for this model. We carried out simulations\nat three points on the critical line taken from the high precision results of Ref. 17,\nKc (0) = 0.4406867952\nKc (2) = 0.7039642053\nKc (4) = 1.1717153065\n3\n\n\fThe basic idea of the two-replica cluster algorithm is to simultaneously simulate two\nindependent Ising systems, \u03c3 and \u03c4 , on the same lattice and in the same field. Clusters of\npairs of spins in this two-replica system are identified and flipped. In order to construct\nclusters, auxilliary bond variables are introduced. The bond variables {\u03b7ij } are defined for\neach bond < i, j > and take values 0 and 1. We say that < i, j > is occupied if \u03b7ij = 1. A\nbond < i, j > is satisfied if \u03c3i = \u03c3j and \u03c4i = \u03c4j . Only satisfied bonds may be occupied.\nThe two-replica algorithm simulates a joint distribution of the Edwards-Sokal18 type for\n{\u03c3i } and {\u03c4i }, and {\u03b7ij }. The statistical weight X[\u03c3, \u03c4, \u03b7] for the joint distribution is\nX[\u03c3, \u03c4, \u03b7] = e\u2212G[\u03c3,\u03c4 ] \u2206[\u03c3, \u03c4, \u03b7]Bp [\u03b7]\nwhere\n\nX\n\nG=K\n\n\u03c3i \u03c4i \u03c3j \u03c4j \u2212\n\nX\n\nHi (\u03c3i + \u03c4i ),\n\n(4)\n\n(5)\n\ni\n\n<i,j>\n\nB is the standard Bernoulli factor,\nBp [\u03b7] = p|\u03b7| (1 \u2212 p)Nb \u2212|\u03b7|\n\n(6)\n\n|\u03b7| = # {< i, j > |\u03b7ij = 1} is the number of occupied bonds and Nb is the total number of\nbonds of the lattice. The \u2206 factor enforces the rule that only satisfied bonds are occupied:\nif for every bond < i, j > such that \u03b7ij = 1 the spins agree in both replicas (\u03c3ij = \u03c3ij\nand \u03c4i = \u03c4j ) then \u2206[\u03c3, \u03c4, \u03b7] = 1; otherwise \u2206[\u03c3, \u03c4, \u03b7] = 0. It is straightforward to show\nthat integrating X[\u03c3, \u03c4, \u03b7] over the bond variables, \u03b7 yields the statistical weight for two\nindependent Ising model in the same field,\ne\u2212\u03b2H[\u03c3]\u2212\u03b2H[\u03c4 ] = const\n\nX\n\nX[\u03c3, \u03c4, \u03b7]\n\n(7)\n\n{\u03b7}\n\nif the identification is made that p = 1 \u2212 e\u22124K .\n\nB.\n\nTwo-Replica Cluster Algorithms\n\nThe idea of the two-replica cluster algorithm is to carry out moves on the spin and bond\nvariables that satisfy detailed balance and are ergodic with respect to the joint distribution\nof Eq. (4). The occupied bonds \u03b7 define connected clusters of sites. We call site i an active\nsite if \u03c3i 6= \u03c4i and clusters are composed either entirely of active or inactive sites. If a cluster\nof active sites is flipped so that \u03c3 \u2190 \u2212\u03c3 and \u03c4 \u2190 \u2212\u03c4 the factor G is unchanged.\n4\n\n\fA single Monte Carlo sweep of the TRC algorithm is composed of the following three\nsteps:\n1. Occupy satisfied bond connecting active sites with probability p = 1 \u2212 e\u22124K . Identify\nclusters of active sites connected by occupied bond (including single active sites). For\neach cluster k, randomly and independently assign a spin value sk = \u00b11. If site i is in\ncluster k then the new spin values are \u03c3i \u2190 sk and \u03c4i \u2190 \u2212sk . In this way all active\nsites are updated.\n2. Update each replica separately with one sweep of the Metropolis algorithm.\n3. Translate the \u03c4 replica by a random amount relative to the \u03c3 replica. If the translation\nis by an odd vector, all \u03c4 spins are flipped.\nStep 1 of the TRC is similar to a sweep of the SW algorithm except that clusters are\ngrown in a two-replica system rather than in a single replica and only active clusters are\nflipped. Note also that the bond occupation probability is p = 1 \u2212 e\u22124K for the TRC\nalgorithm and p = 1 \u2212 e\u22122K for the SW algorithm. It is straightforward to show that Step\n1 of the TRC algorithm satisfies detailed balance with respect to the joint distribution Eq.\n(4). Since only active sites participate in Step 1 of the algorithm, the Metropolis sweep,\nStep 2, is required for ergodicity. Step 3 contains the optional components of the algorithm:\nan even translation or an odd translation plus flip of one replica relative to the other. These\nmoves are justified by the symmetries of the Ising model in a staggered field stated in Eqs.\n(2) and (3). When we refer to the TRC algorithm without further specification, we mean\nthe algorithm described by the Steps 1-3 above. In the foregoing we also study the TRC\nwith only even translations or with only odd translations.\nIn the TRC algorithm we flip only active clusters but it is also possible to flip inactive\nclusters if a weight factor associated with the change in G is used. We call a flip of an active\ncluster to an active cluster (+\u2212 to \u2212+ or \u2212+ to +\u2212) an active flip. The TRC algorithm\nwith inactive flips is obtained by replacing Step 1 with the following:\n1\u2032 . Occupy satisfied bonds with probability p = 1 \u2212 e\u22124K . Identify clusters connected\nby occupied bonds (including single sites). For each cluster k, taken one at a time,\nrandomly propose two new spin values values, sk = \u00b11 and tk = \u00b11 for the \u03c3 and \u03c4\n5\n\n\fspins respectively. Compute \u03b4G, the change in G that would occur if the spins in the\nk th cluster are changed to the proposed values leaving spins in other clusters fixed. If\n\u03b4G \u2264 0 accept the proposed spin values (set \u03c3i \u2190 sk and \u03c4i \u2190 tk for all sites i in\ncluster k), otherwise, if \u03b4G > 0 accept the proposed spin values with probability e\u2212\u03b4G .\nStep 1\u2032 is by itself ergodic however it may be useful to add Metropolis sweeps and translations.\n\nIII.\n\nMETHODS\n\nWe measured three observables using the TRC algorithm: the absolute value of the\nmagnetization of a single replica, m; the energy of a single replica, E; and the absolute value\nof the net staggered magnetization for both replicas, s, where the definition of s is\ns = |(\n\nX\ni\u2208odd\n\nX\n\n\u2212\n\n)(\u03c3i + \u03c4i )|.\n\n(8)\n\ni\u2208even\n\nNote that the staggered magnetization is conserved by all components of the TRC algorithm except Metropolis sweeps and inactive flips. For each of these observables we computed expectation values of the integrated autocorrelation time, \u03c4int and the exponential\nautocorrelation time, \u03c4exp . From \u03c4int , we estimated the dynamic exponent z.\nThe autocorrelation function for \u03c6, \u0393\u03c6\u03c6 (t) is given by,\n\u0393\u03c6\u03c6 (t) = lim\n\nl\u2192\u221e\n\nPl\u2212t\n\n\u2032\n\u2032\nt\u2032 =1 (\u03c6(t ) \u2212 \u03c6\u0302)(\u03c6(t + t)\nPl\n\u2032\n2\nt\u2032 =1 (\u03c6(t ) \u2212 \u03c6\u0302)\n\n\u2212 \u03c6\u0302)\n\n.\n\n(9)\n\nThe integrated autocorrelation time for observable \u03c6 is defined by\nt\nX\n1\n\u03c4 = + \u2217lim\n\u0393\u03c6\u03c6 (t)\n2 t \u2192\u221e t=1\n\u2217\n\n(10)\n\nand the exponential autocorrelation time for an observable \u03c6 is defined by19\n\u03c4exp,\u03c6 = lim\n\nt\u2192\u221e\n\n\u2212|t|\n.\nlog \u0393\u03c6\u03c6 (t)\n\n(11)\n\nIn practice the limits in Eqs. (9), (10) and (11) must be evaluated at finite values. The\nlength of the Monte Carlo runs determine l and are discussed below.

We\nused the least-squares method to fit log \u0393\u03c6\u03c6 (t/\u03c4int,\u03c6 ) as a function of t to obtain the ratio of\n\u03c4int,\u03c6 /\u03c4exp,\u03c6 and chose a cut-off at t/\u03c4int,\u03c6 = 5.\nWe used the blocking method7,19 to estimate errors. The whole sample of n MC measurements was divided into m blocks of equal length l = n/m. For each block i and each\nmeasured quantity A, we computed the mean \u00c2i . Our estimates of \u00c2 and its error \u03b4A are\nobtained from:\n\nm\n1 X\n\u00c2 =\n\u00c2i\nm i=1\n\n\u03b4 \u00c22 =\n\nm\nX\n1\n(\u00c2 \u2212 \u00c2i )2\nm(m \u2212 1) i=1\n\n(13)\n(14)\n\nIn our simulations, we divided the whole sample into m blocks where m is between 10 and\n30.\nFor the data collected using the TRC algorithm, each block has a length l \u2265 103\u03c4int .\nFor the data collected using modifications of the TRC algorithm, each block has a length\nl \u2265 102 \u03c4int . Data were collected for H = 0, 2 and 4 and for size L in the range 16 to 256.\n\nIV.\nA.\n\nRESULTS\nIntegrated Autocorrelation Time\n\nTable I gives the integrated autocorrelation time using the TRC algorithm for the magnetization, energy and staggered magnetization. Table I is comparable to the Table in Ref.\n10 but the present numbers are systematically larger, especially at the larger system sizes.\nThis discrepancy may be due to the sliding cut-off t\u2217 used here instead of a fixed cut-off at\n200 employed in Ref. 10.\nTable II gives the integrated autocorrelation times for magnetization using the TRC\nwith only even or only odd translations. The comparison of TRC algorithm with only even\ntranslations and with only odd translations in Tables II shows that odd translations together\nwith global flips of one replica relative to another are essential to achieve small and slowly\ngrowing autocorrelation times when the staggered field is present.\nTable III shows the magnetization autocorrelation times using different algorithms for\nsystem size L = 80. The Swendsen-Wang (SW) algorithm has the smallest \u03c4int,m in the\n7\n\n\fabsence of fields. However, when fields are present and the SW algorithm is then modified\naccording to the method of Ref. 8 the performance is worse even than that of the Metropolis\nalgorithm. The slow equilibration of the SW algorithm in the presence of the staggered field\nis due to small acceptance probabilities for flipping large clusters. On the other hand, the\npresence of staggered fields does not significantly change the performance the two-replica\nalgorithm so long as odd translations are present. Inactive flips are helpful when there is\nno staggered field but when the staggered field is turned on, the autocorrelation time is not\nsubstantially improved by inactive flips. The explanation for the ineffectiveness of inactive\nflips when the staggered field is present is that the probability of accepting an inactive flip\nis small. For example, this probability is 1.4% for L = 80 and H = 4.\nThe CPU time per spin on a Pentium III 450 MHz machine was also measured for the\nvarious algorithms and is listed in Table III for L = 80 . By considering a range of system\nsizes we found that the CPU time for one MC sweep of the TRC algorithm increases nearly\nlinearly with the number of spins. The TRC algorithm is a factor of 3 slower than the\nMetropolis algorithm but this difference is more than compensated for by system size 80\nby the much faster equilibration of the TRC algorithm. Even without odd translations, the\nTRC algorithm outperforms Metropolis for size 80.\n\nB.\n\nExponential Autocorrelation Time\n\nThe ratio of the integrated to exponential autocorrelation times was found to be nearly\nindependent of system size over the range L = 16 to L = 256. We found that over this size\nrange \u03c4int,m /\u03c4exp,m varied from 0.448 \u00b1 0.008 to 0.425 \u00b1 0.008 for H = 0; from 0.44 \u00b1 0.01\nto 0.43 \u00b1 0.01 for H = 2; and from 0.448 \u00b1 0.009 to 0.409 \u00b1 0.009 for H = 4. The ratio\n\u03c4int,s /\u03c4exp,s is also nearly independent of L and H and is about 0.45. The ratio \u03c4int,E /\u03c4exp,E is\nnearly independent of L but decreases slowly with H ranging from 0.29 to 0.25 as H ranges\nfrom 0 to 4. The almost constant \u03c4int,\u03c6 /\u03c4exp,\u03c6 for different sizes suggests that the integrated\nand exponential autocorrelation times are governed by the same dynamic critical exponent.\n\n8\n\n\fC.\n\nDynamic Exponent\n\nFigures 2 and 3 show the magnetization integrated autocorrelation time for the TRC\nplotted on log-log and log-linear scales, respectively. Figures 4 and 5 show the energy integrated autocorrelation time for the TRC plotted on log-log and log-linear scales, respectively.\nFigures 6 and 7 show the staggered magnetization integrated autocorrelation time for the\nTRC plotted on log-log and log-linear scales, respectively.\nFor the whole range of L, logarithmic growth appears to give a somewhat better fit than\na simple power law, particularly for the magnetization. Therefore, our results are consistent\nwith z = 0 for the TRC algorithm. Under the assumption that the dynamic exponent is not\nzero, we also carried out weighted least-squares fits to the form ALz and varied Lmin , the\nminimum system size included in the fit. Figures 8, 9 and 10 show the dynamic exponent\nz for the magnetization, energy and staggered magnetization, respectively, as a function\nof Lmin using the TRC algorithm. Figures 11 and 12, show the dynamic exponent as a\nfunction of Lmin for the magnetization for the TRC with only even translations and only\nodd translations, respectively. In all cases except zint,m,even , the dynamic exponent is a\ndecreasing function of Lmin . For the magnetization, zint,m appears to extrapolate to a value\nbetween 0.1 and 0.2 as Lmin \u2192 \u221e while for the energy and staggered magnetization, the\ndynamic exponent appears to extrapolate to a value between 0.3 and 0.4. The small value of\nthe dynamic exponent requires that odd translations and flips are included in the algorithm.\nFrom Fig. 11 it is clear that the dynamic exponent is near 2 for the TRC algorithm with\nonly even translations.\nTable IV gives results of the weighted least squares fits for z for the smallest values of Lmin\nfor which there is a reasonable confidence level. Since there is a general downward curvature\nin the log-log graphs, these numbers are likely to be overestimates of the asymptotic values.\nThus, we can conclude that the asymptotic dynamic exponent for the TRC algorithm is\nlikely to be less than 0.4 and is perhaps exactly zero. The dynamic exponent is apparently\nindependent of the strength of the staggered field. For the case of the SW algorithm applied\nto the two-dimensional Ising with no staggered field the best estimate is z = 0.25 \u00b1 0.0120,21\nbut the results are also consistent with logarithmic growth of relaxation times. The numbers\nfor dynamic exponent for the SW appear to be smaller than for the TRC algorithm but this\ndifference may simply reflect larger corrections to scaling in the case of the TRC .\n9\n\n\fV.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nWe studied the dynamics of the two-replica cluster algorithm applied to the twodimensional Ising model in a staggered field. We found that the dynamic exponent of\nthe algorithm is either very small (z \u2264 0.4) or zero ( \u03c4 \u223c log L) and that the dynamic\nexponent does not depend on the strength of the staggered field. A precise value of z could\nnot be determined because of large corrections to scaling. We tested the importance of\nvarious optional components of the algorithm and found that an odd translation and global\nflip of one replica relative to another is essential for achieving rapid equilibration. Without\nthis component, z is near 2 so there is no qualitative improvement over the Metropolis algorithm. An odd translation and global flip of one replica relative to the other allows for a\nlarge change of the total magnetization of the system with an acceptance fraction of 100%.\nLarge changes in the global magnetization may also occur in the Swendsen-Wang algorithm\nin a field or via inactive flips in the TRC algorithm but these flips have a small acceptance\nfraction due to the staggered field. Unfortunately, the odd translation and flip move is\nallowed because of a special symmetry of the Ising model in a staggered field. For more\ngeneral Ising systems with translationally invariant fields, we expect performance similar to\nthe TRC with even translations only. In this case, the autocorrelation time is significantly\nless than for the Metropolis algorithm but the dynamic exponent is about the same. While\nthe two-replica approach is useful for these more general problems of Ising systems with\nfields, it does not constitute a method that overcomes critical slowing down except when\nadditional symmetries are present that allow one replica to be flipped relative to the other.\nDevelopment of general methods for efficiently simulating critical spin systems with fields\nremains an open problem.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThis work was supported in part by NSF grants DMR 9978233.\n\n\u2217\n\nmachta@physics.umass.edu\n\n1\n\nR.
