At each step\nrelaxation of magnetization of an SMM occurs through a\nquantum-tunneling path.4,5 The discovery of this phenomenon,\nalso evidenced by temperature independent relaxation6-11 and\nquantum phase interference12 has led to the idea of using SMMs\nfor quantum computing.13\nMost SMMs are composed of a high-spin polynuclear\ntransition-metal complex with a high axial magnetic anisotropy.\nAnother promising approach to construct SMMs is to use highspin lanthanide ions as the magnetic center.14 Alternating current\n(ac) magnetic susceptibility measurements above 2 K for the six\nheavy lanthanide complexes with phthalocyanines, [(Pc)2Ln]\u2013 (Pc\ndenotes phthalocyaninato, Ln = Tb, Dy, Ho, Er, Tm or Yb)\nshowed that the terbium and dysprosium complexes having large\naxial magnetic anisotropies behave as SMMs.14,15 The magnetic\nanisotropy change from easy-axial to easy-planar type occurs\nbetween the Ho and Er complexes in the series of the above six\nPc double-decker complexes.16,17 It has therefore been of great\ninterest to show whether the Ho complex with an axial anisotropy\ncan show SMM behavior at low temperatures.\nIn this communication, we report the first magnetizationversus-field measurement in the subkelvin range on [(Pc)2Ho]\u2013\ndoped in diamagnetic [(Pc)2Y]\u2013*TBA+ (TBA+ = tetrabutylammonium cation). We show that the Ho complex exhibit not\nonly hysteresis loops, but also resonant quantum tunneling of\nmagnetization (QTM), which is a characteristic feature of SMMs.\n\u2013\n\nScheme 1. [Pc2Ho] .\n\nThe compounds were prepared as reported in literature18,19 with\ncertain modifications.16 The doped single crystalline samples\nwere prepared by recrystallization from an acetone solution of the\ntwo compounds [Pc2Ho]\u2013*TBA+ and [Pc2Y]\u2013*TBA+, the masses of\nwhich were measured by an analytical balance. The crystal\nstructure of the former compound has been reported by Koike,\net.al.20 Because of the strong resemblance between the ionic\nradius of HoIII (1.155 \u00c5) and YIII (1.159 \u00c5),21 the two chemically\nanalogous compounds are highly expected to have isostructural\ncrystal structures. All measurements were performed using the\nmicro-SQUID technique.22 The field was aligned parallel to the\n\neasy axis of magnetization, using the transverse field method,23\nwhich was found to be parallel to the crystallographic c-direction.\nFigure 1 shows magnetization vs. field measurements for a\nsingle crystal with the ratio of [Ho]/[Y]=1/49. Hysteresis is\nobserved below 0.5 K and a step structure emerges. The\nhysteresis loops at 0.04 K (Figure 1-b) show a clear staircase-like\nstructure indicating the occurrence of QTM. The steps are\npositioned equidistantly along the magnetic field axis at \u03bc0Hn = n\n\u00d7 23.5 mT (n = 0, 1, 2, 3...). These steps were strongly\nbroadened for the undiluted sample.\n\nFigure 1. (a) Hysteresis loops at several temperatures for a single crystal\nof [(Pc)2Ho0.02Y0.98]\u2013*TBA+ measured at the field scan rate of 0.28 T/s. (b)\nHysteresis loops at 0.04 K measured at several field scan rates.\n\nThe ligand field (LF) splitting of the [(Pc)2Ln]\u2013 complexes has\nbeen determined previously by \"simultaneous optimization\" of\nstatic magnetic susceptibility and 1H-NMR paramagnetic shift\ndata.16,17 The lowest substate in the 5I8 ground multiplet of\n[(Pc)2Ho]\u2013 was shown to be the Jz = \u00b15 doublet.16 Under the\nmagnetic field of the strength in the present paper, there is no\ncrossing between sublevels of different |Jz| values because of the\nlarge zero-field splitting due to the LF term. This situation\nclearly contrasts with the transition-metal-cluster SMMs, in which\nenergy of substates with different |Sz| values can coincide to give\nrise to a QTM process under an magnetic field below 1T because\nenergy separations between substates are of the order of 1 to 10\ncm\u20131. The QTM observed for [(Pc)2Ho]\u2013 cannot be attributed to\nthe same mechanism as in the transition-metal-cluster SMMs.\nHolmium has a nucleus with I = 7/2 spin in a natural\nabundance of 100 %. Each sublevel of the J = 8 ground multiplet\nis split into an octet by the hyperfine interaction between the\n(4f)10 system and the nucleus. We performed exact numerical\ndiagonalization of a (2J+1)(2I+1)\u00d7(2J+1)(2I+1) matrix including\nthe hyperfine interaction AhfJ*I and the LF terms Ak0\u3008rk\u3009Ok0 (k = 2,\n4 and 6) with the LF parameters Ak0\u3008rk\u3009 determined previously.16\nFigure 2-a shows the Zeeman diagram for the sixteen\n|Jz\u3009|Iz\u3009 states created from the combinations of the Jz = \u00b15 lowest\ndoublet and I = 7/2 octet. The level intersections are seen at 15\n\n\fmagnetic field positions. All observed step positions are\nreproduced with Ahf = 0.0276 cm\u20131.\n\nFigure 3. (a) Enlargement of hysteresis loops in Figure 1-b for a single\ncrystal of [(Pc)2Ho0.02Y0.98]\u2013*TBA+. (b) Hysteresis loops at the same\nconditions for [(Pc)2Ho0.2Y0.8]\u2013*TBA+. The height of the steps indicated by\nthe arrows is increased.\n\nIn conclusion, we have shown QTM in [(Pc)2Ho]\u2013, a new\nlanthanide single-ion SMM. The quantum process is due to\nresonant quantum tunneling between entangled states of the\nelectronic and nuclear spin systems, which is an essentially\ndifferent mechanism from those of the transition-metal-cluster\nSMMs.\n*\n\u2020\n\u2021\n\n(1)\n(2)\n\n(3)\nFigure 2. (a) Zeeman energy diagrams as a function of longitudinal\n\nmagnetic field for the lowest Jz = \u00b15 substates with I = 7/2 nucleus\ncalculated with the LF parameters determined in ref. 16 and Ahf = 0.0276\ncm\u20131. Squares, circles, and asterisks are explained in the text. (b) Plot for\nthe intersection of |+5\u3009|\u20133/2\u3009 and |\u20135\u3009|+1/2\u3009 with several values for A44\u3008r4\u3009.\n(c) The intersection of |+5\u3009|\u20133/2\u3009 and |\u20135\u3009|\u20131/2\u3009 as a function of transverse\nmagnetic field Htrans.\n\nFor QTM to occur at a level intersection, the two states must be\ncoupled leading to an avoided level crossing. Such coupling\nwithin the Jz = \u00b15 manifold is achieved by off-diagonal LF terms,\nsuch as A44\u3008r4\u3009O44 and A64\u3008r6\u3009O64, and the hyperfine-coupling\nterm AhfI*J. The former terms couple |Jz\u3009|Iz\u3009 and |Jz+4\u3009|Iz\u3009, while\nthe latter |Jz\u3009|Iz\u3009 and |Jz+1\u3009|Iz\u20131\u3009.\nThe 64 intersections can be grouped into three types. At the\nintersections indicated by circles, non-zero O44 or O64 terms yield\navoided level crossings as shown in Figure 2-b. At the positions\nmarked by squares, avoided crossings can occur with a non-zero\nO22 term, which is possible when the four-fold symmetry is lost.\nFor the rest of crossing points, which are labeled by asterisks, the\npresence of a transverse magnetic field is required to give avoided\ncrossings as shown in Figure 2-c. Thus the steps marked by\nasterisks in Figure 1-b are assigned to this type.\nSmall steps which cannot be categorized in any of the three\ntypes above are observed at \u03bc0H = \u00b110 mT as shown in Figure 3-a.\nThe height of these steps is significantly increased for higher Ho\nconcentrations (Figure 3-b). They are most probably due to the\ntwo-body tunnel transitions such as the spin-spin cross-relaxation\n(SSCR)24 mediated by magnetic dipolar interactions between Ho\ncomplexes, which have been recently observed for a scheelitestructured compound LiYF4 doped with Ho ions 25 and for Mn4\nSMMs.26\n\n(4)\n(5)\n(6)\n(7)\n(8)\n(9)\n(10)\n(11)\n\n(12)\n(13)\n(14)\n(15)\n(16)\n(17)\n(18)\n(19)\n(20)\n(21)\n(22)\n(23)\n(24)\n(25)\n(26)\n\nTo whom correspondence should be addressed.\nTokyo Institute of Technology, Japan\nLaboratoire Louis N\u00e9el, France\nChristou, G.; Gatteschi, D.; Hendrichson, D.
