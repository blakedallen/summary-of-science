biological scenarios,\nincluding the structure of elementary particles [1, 2, 3], the early universe cosmology [4, 5, 6],\nthe Bose-Einstein condensation [7, 8], the polymer folding [9] and the DNA replication,\ntranscription and recombination [10]. Generally, knotlike configurations are researched by\nusing the Jones polynomial and path integral methods in physics [11, 12, 13]. Meanwhile, it\nis known that for a knot family there are very important characteristic numbers to describe\nits topology [14]. So in the research of the knotlike configurations in physics, one should\nalso pay much attention to the geometric and topological characteristics.\nAs is well known, magnetic helicity has attracted a great deal of attention since it provides\na lower bound for the magnetic energy [15, 16, 17] and is a very robust invariant. Magnetic\nhelicity can be considered as a special case of the cross helicity, which is defined for two\ndistinct magnetic fields B and B \u2032\n\u2032\n\nH(B, B ) =\n\nZ\n\nA \u2227 dA\u2032 .\n\n(1)\n\nM3\n\nSo the question arises whether there exists a generalization to electromagnetic field, especially to the physically interesting four-dimensional case. Principally, the electromagnetic\nfield can be investigated in the frame of a U(1) gauge field theory. In this paper, we intend to study the geometric and topological characteristic of knotlike vortex lines in the\nelectromagnetic field by using the decomposition of U(1) gauge potential theory and the\n\u03c6-mapping theory. The gauge potential decomposition theory [18] establishes a direct relationship between differential geometry and topology, and the \u03c6-mapping topological current\ntheory provides an important method in investigating the inner topological structure of field\nconfigurations [19, 20, 21]. The purpose of the present paper is twofold. First we show that\nthere exist vortex lines in the U(1) gauge field and obtain a knot invariant for knotlike vortex\nlines. The second purpose is to extend to four-dimensional case and give a new topological\ninvariant.\nThis paper is arranged as follows. In Sec. II, using the U(1) gauge potential decomposition theory and the \u03c6-mapping topological current theory, we discuss the inner topological\nstructure of the knotlike vortex lines in the U(1) gauge field and get a knot invariant. In\nSec. III, a new topological invariant is obtained in a four-dimensional case. The conclusion\nof this paper is given in Sec. IV.\n2\n\n\fII.\n\nKNOT INVARIANT IN THE U (1) GAUGE FIELD\n\nWe know that the complex scalar field \u03c6 can be regarded as the complex representation\n~ = (\u03c61 , \u03c62 ) over the base space, i.e. \u03c6 = \u03c61 + i\u03c62 , where\nof a two-dimensional vector field \u03c6\n\u03c6a (a = 1, 2) are real functions. The covariant derivative of \u03c6 is defined as\nD\u03bc \u03c6 = \u2202\u03bc \u03c6 \u2212 iA\u03bc \u03c6, (\u03bc = 1, 2, 3),\n\n(2)\n\nwhere A\u03bc is the U(1) gauge potential. The U(1) gauge field tensor is given by F\u03bc\u03bd =\n\u2202\u03bc A\u03bd \u2212 \u2202\u03bd A\u03bc . In the subsection we will show that in the U(1) gauge field theory there exist\nthe vortex line structures. Defining the unit vector na as\nna =\n\n\u03c6a\n, k\u03c6k2 = \u03c6\u03c6\u2217 ,\nk\u03c6k\n\n(3)\n\none can prove that [20], A\u03bc can be decomposed in terms of na : A\u03bc = \u01ebab na \u2202\u03bc nb \u2212 \u2202\u03bc \u03b8, where\n\u03b8 is a phase factor. Since the term (\u2202\u03bc \u03b8) dose not contribute to the gauge field tensor, A\u03bc\nand F\u03bc\u03bd can be rewritten as\nA\u03bc = \u01ebab na \u2202\u03bc nb , F\u03bc\u03bd = 2\u01ebab \u2202\u03bc na \u2202\u03bd nb .\n\n(4)\n\nIn the following, we will use these above decomposition expressions Eq. (4) to research the\ntopological feature in the U(1) gauge field theory. As an analog of Eq. (1), define a action\nI in terms of two distinct electromagnetic field tensors F i and F j by\nZ\nZ\n1\n1\nj 3\ni\nj\ni\nj\nA \u2227F =\n\u01eb\u03bc\u03bd\u03bb Ai\u03bc F\u03bd\u03bb\nd x.\nI(F , F ) =\n4\u03c0 M\n8\u03c0 M\n\n(5)\n\nSubstituting F i = F j in Eq. (5) returns the expression for Chern-Simon action [3]. To\nsimplify the action, we introduce a topological current\nJ\u03bc =\n\n1 \u03bc\u03bd\u03bb j\n\u01eb F\u03bd\u03bb .\n8\u03c0\n\n(6)\n\nThen Eq. (5) can be expressed as\ni\n\nj\n\nI(F , F ) =\n\nZ\n\nAi\u03bc J \u03bc d3 x.\n\n(7)\n\nM\n\nIn order to explore the inner topological structure of the action I, we should first investigate\nthat of J \u03bc . Then taking account of Eq. (4), using \u2202\u03bc na = \u2202\u03bc \u03c6a /k\u03c6k + \u03c6a \u2202\u03bc (1/k\u03c6k) and the\nGreen's function relation in \u03c6 space [21], one can prove that\n~ \u03bc ( \u03c6 ),\nJ \u03bc = \u03b4 2 (\u03c6)D\nx\n3\n\n(8)\n\n\fwhere\n\u03c6\n1\nD \u03bc ( ) = \u01eb\u03bc\u03bb\u03c1 \u01ebab \u2202\u03bb \u03c6a \u2202\u03c1 \u03c6b\nx\n2\nis the Jacobian vector. The expression Eq. (8) provides an important conclusion:\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f2 = 0 if and only if \u03c6\n~ 6= 0.\nJ\u03bc\n\uf8f3 6= 0 if and only if \u03c6\n~ = 0.\n\n(9)\n\n(10)\n\n~ field to determine the nonzero solutions of\nSo it is necessary to study the zero points of the \u03c6\nJ \u03bc . The implicit function theory [22] shows that under the regular condition D \u03bc (\u03c6/x) 6= 0,\n\nthe general solutions of\n\u03c61 (x1 , x2 , x3 ) = 0, \u03c62 (x1 , x2 , x3 ) = 0\n\n(11)\n\nx1 = x1k (s),\n\n(12)\n\ncan be expressed as\nx2 = x2k (s), x3 = x3k (s)\n\nwhich represent N isolated singular strings Lk with string parameter s (k = 1, 2, ..., N).\nThese singular string solutions are just the vortex lines in the U(1) gauge field.\nIn the \u03b4-function theory [23], one can prove that in three-dimensional space\n~ =\n\u03b4 (\u03c6)\n2\n\nN\nX\n\n\u03b2k\n\nZ\n\nLk\n\nk=1\n\n\u03b4 3 (~x \u2212 ~xk (s))\nds,\n|D( \u03c6u )|\u03a3k\n\n(13)\n\nwhere\n1\nD(\u03c6/u)\u03a3k = \u01eb\u03bc\u03bd \u01ebmn (\u2202\u03c6m /\u2202u\u03bc )(\u2202\u03c6n /\u2202u\u03bd ),\n2\n\n(14)\n\nand \u03a3k is the kth planar element transverse to Lk with local coordinates (u1 , u2). The\npositive integer \u03b2k is the Hopf index of the \u03c6-mapping, which means that when ~x covers the\n~ covers the corresponding region\nneighborhood of the zero point ~xk (s) once, the vector field \u03c6\nin \u03c6 space \u03b2k times. Meanwhile taking notice of Eqs. (9) and (14), the direction vector of\nLk is given [21] by\n\ndx\u03bc\nds\n\n=\n~\nxk\n\nD \u03bc (\u03c6/x)\nD(\u03c6/u)\n\n.\n\n(15)\n\n~\nxk\n\nThen from Eqs. (13) and (15), we obtain the inner structure of J \u03bc\n~ \u03bc( \u03c6 ) =\nJ = \u03b4 (\u03c6)D\nx\n\u03bc\n\n2\n\nN\nX\n\nWk\n\nZ\n\nLk\n\nk=1\n\n4\n\ndx\u03bc 3\n\u03b4 (~x \u2212 ~xk (s))ds,\nds\n\n(16)\n\n\f~ around Lk , with \u03b7k = sgnD(\u03c6/u)~x = \u00b11\nin which Wk = \u03b2k \u03b7k is the winding number of \u03c6\nk\nbeing the Brouwer degree of \u03c6-mapping. It can be seen that when these U(1) vortex lines\nare N closed curves, i.e., a family of N knots \u03b3k (k = 1, ..., N), and taking account of Eqs.\n(7) and (16), the action I(F i , F j ) is reexpressed as\nI\nZ\nN\nX\ni\nj\ni \u03bc\n3\nWk\nAi\u03bc dx\u03bc .\nI(F , F ) =\nA\u03bc J dx =\nM\n\nk=1\n\n(17)\n\n\u03b3k\n\nThis is a very important expression. Consider the U(1) gauge transformation of A\u03bc :\n\u2032\n\nAi \u03bc = Ai\u03bc + \u2202\u03bc \u03b8,\n\n(18)\n\nwhere \u03b8 is a phase factor denoting the U(1) transformation. It can be shown that the (\u2202\u03bc \u03b8)\nterm in Eq. (18) contributes nothing to the integral I, that is, the expression Eq. (17) is\ninvariant under the U(1) gauge transformation. Meanwhile we know that I is independent\nof the metric g\u03bc\u03bd . Therefore one can conclude that the action I(F i , F j ) in Eq. (5) is a\ntopological invariant for the knotlike vortex lines in the U(1) gauge field theory.\n\nIII.\n\nTHE NEW FOUR-DIMENSIONAL TOPOLOGICAL INVARIANT\n\nThe action I(F i , F j ) is of three-dimensional nature due to the integral over M 3 , so the\nquestion arises whether there exists a generalization to higher dimensions, especially to the\nphysically interesting four-dimensional case [24]. In this section, we construct a new action\nin four dimensions, which is based on the so-called Novikov invariant [25] .\nIn the following the field tensor F\u03bc\u03bd = \u2202\u03bc A\u03bd \u2212 \u2202\u03bd A\u03bc is also interpreted as the U(1) gauge\nfield over a simply connected domain M 4 , in which A\u03bc is the U(1) gauge potential.

When these vortex lines are closed curves, i.e. a family of knots \u03b3k , \u03b3l (k, l = 1 * * * N),\nthe new action Eq. (21) can be expressed as\ni\n\nj\n\nk\n\nN(F , F , F ) =\n\nN X\nN\nX\n\nWk Wl\n\nI\n\nAi\u03bc dx\u03bc\n\n\u03b3k\n\nk=1 l=1\n\n\u2227\n\nI\n\nAj\u03bd dx\u03bd .\n\n(31)\n\n\u03b3l\n\nConsidering the U(1) transformation of A\n\u2032\n\nAi \u03bc = Ai\u03bc + \u2202\u03bc \u03b1,\n\n\u2032\n\nAj \u03bd = Aj\u03bd + \u2202\u03bd \u03b8,\n\n(32)\n\none can seen that the \u2202\u03bc \u03b1 and \u2202\u03bd \u03b8 contribute nothing to the action N(F i , F j , F k ). So the\nexpression Eq. (31) is invariant under the gauge transformation. Meanwhile we know that\nN(F i , F j , F k ) is independent of the metric. Therefore one can conclude that N(F i , F j , F k )\nis a topological invariant. Since the invariant N(F i , F j , F k ) is concerned with two families\nof knotlike vortex lines \u03b3k and \u03b3l (k, l = 1, * * *N), we conjecture that it is invariant for\nthe linkage of vortex lines. As follows, we will research the relationship between the new\ninvariant and the linking numbers of the knots family. We should first express A\u03bc in terms\nof the vector field which carries the geometric information of the linkage, namely, we need to\ndecompose Ai\u03bc and Aj\u03bc in terms of another two-dimensional unit vector ~e which is different\nfrom the two-dimensional vector ~n in Sec. II. Define the Gauss mapping m\n~\nm(~\n~ y , ~x) =\n\n~y \u2212 ~x\n,\n||~y \u2212 ~x||\n\n(33)\n\nwhere ~x and ~y are two points, respectively, on the knots \u03b3k and \u03b3l . Denote the twodimensional unit vector ~e = ~e(~x, ~y ) as\nea ea = 1 (a = 1, 2; ~e \u22a5 m).\n~\n\n7\n\n(34)\n\n\fThen according to Ref. [20], A\u03bc can be decomposed in terms of this two-dimensional vector\nea : Ai\u03bc = \u01ebab ea \u2202\u03bc eb \u2212 \u2202\u03bc \u03c6; Aj\u03bc = \u01ebab ea \u2202\u03bc eb \u2212 \u2202\u03bc \u03b8, where \u03c6 and \u03b8 are phase factors. Since\nthe terms \u2202\u03bc \u03c6 and \u2202\u03bc \u03b8 contribute nothing to the integral N(F i , F j , F k ), A\u03bc can in fact be\nexpressed as\nAi\u03bc = \u01ebab ea \u2202\u03bc eb ,\n\nAj\u03bc = \u01ebab ea \u2202\u03bc eb .\n\n(35)\n\nSubstituting Eq. (35) into Eq. (31) and considering ~x and ~y are two points, respectively, on\nthe knots \u03b3k and \u03b3l , we have\ni\n\nj\n\nk\n\nN(F , F , F ) =\n\nN X\nN\nX\n\nWk Wl\n\nI I\n\u03b3k\n\nk=1 l=1\n\n\u01ebab \u2202\u03bc ea (~x, ~y )\u2202\u03bd eb (~x, ~y)dx\u03bc \u2227 dy \u03bd .\n\n(36)\n\n\u03b3l\n\nUsing the relation \u01ebab \u2202\u03bc ea \u2202\u03bd eb = 12 m\n~ * (\u2202\u03bc m\n~ \u00d7 \u2202\u03bd m),\n~ Eq.

Therefore, we\narrive at the important result\nI = 2\u03c0\n\nN X\nN\nX\n\nWk Wl L(\u03b3k , \u03b3l ).\n\n(39)\n\nk=1 l=1\n\nThis precise expression just reveals the relationship between the new invariant and the linking number of the knots family [28, 29]. Since the linking numbers are invariant characteristic\nnumbers of the knotlike closed curves in topology, N(F i , F j , F k ) is an important invariant\nrequired to describe the linkage of knotlike vortex lines in the U(1) gauge field.\n\nIV.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nIn this paper, using the decomposition of U(1) gauge potential theory and the \u03c6-mapping\ntopological current theory, we obtain the topological structure of the knot invariant in the\nthree-dimensional U(1) gauge field and that of the link invariant in four-dimensional case.\n8\n\n\fWe show that the action I(F i , F j ) is a knot invariant for the knotlike vortex lines inhering\nin the U(1) gauge field. Furthermore, by generalizing to four-dimensional case, we construct\na new action N(F i , F j , F k ) and discuss the topological properties of the new action. It is\npointed out that the new action N(F i , F j , F k ) is a topological invariant for the knotlike\n~ field. Finally, by introducing the Gauss mapping, we\nvortex lines existing in the zeros of \u03c6\nfind out the relationship between the new invariant N(F i , F j , F k ) and the Gauss linking\nnumber. Therefore, we reveal that the new action is a link invariant for knotlike vortex lines\nin four dimensions.\n\nV.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\n\nThis work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China and the\nDoctoral Foundation of the People's Republic of China.\n\n[1] E.
