The\nisolation of this single donor-bound exciton complex and its potential homogeneity offer promising prospects\nfor a scalable semiconductor qubit with an optical interface.\nPACS numbers: 78.55.Et, 78.67.-n, 03.67.-a\nSchemes for quantum information processing and\nquantum communications rely on scalable, robust qubits.\nIn particular, there are many proposals that require fast,\nefficient, and homogenous single-photon sources1\u20133 and\nstill others that rely on the interaction between matter qubits and flying photonic qubits4 . The requisites\nfor both types of schemes can be satisfied with semiconductor electron spins, which serve as single photon\nsources5 or long lived quantum memories with an optical interface6\u20138 . However, optical schemes, particularly\nthose based on entanglement, also require large numbers\nof homogenous photon emitters9\u201314 . Electron spins in\nself-assembled QDs, unfortunately, suffer from large inhomogenities due to their natural size distribution.\nImpurity-bound electrons in direct bandgap semiconductors, however, have relatively little inhomogeneous\nbroadening15\u201320 , yet still possess strong optical transitions when binding an additional exciton18\u201321 and long\nground state coherence times7 .\nAn electron bound to a single fluorine donor in ZnSe\n(F:ZnSe) may serve as a physical qubit with many potential advantages over previously researched qubits.\nF:ZnSe is particularly appealing because of its nuclear\nstructure compared to III-V-based bound-exciton or\nquantum dot systems. Unlike III-V systems, isotopic\npurification of the ZnSe-host matrix to a nuclear-spin-0\nbackground is possible, eliminating magnetic noise from\nnuclear spin diffusion22,23 . Further, the F-impurity has\na nuclear spin of 1/2 with 100% abundance. Electronnuclear spin swapping schemes24,25 can be used, which,\nin combination with the spin-0 background of the isotopically purified host matrix, could lead to an extremely\nlong-lived qubit. Additionally, the applicability of standard microfabrication techniques26,27 to ZnSe makes the\nF:ZnSe system particularly scalable.\nThe F:ZnSe system has already shown promise as a\nscalable source of single photons in Ref. 20. However,\n\nthis work did not demonstrate the potential of the donor\nsystem as a future quantum memory. Here, we show\nboth statistics for single photon emission, as well as the\npresence of a three-level optical \u039b-system through magnetospectroscopy experiments. This introduces F:ZnSe\nas a valid candidate for use as a scalable qubit with an\noptical interface.\na)\n\nb)\nZn0.92Mg0.08Se 28 nm\n\nD 0X\n\n5 nm\n\nF:ZnSe QW\nZn0.92Mg0.08Se 28 nm\n15 nm\nZnSe\n\npump\n\nI2\n\n2s-TES\n\nGaAs\n~21 meV\n\n2s,2p\n1s\n\nc)\nFE-HH\nFE-LH\n\nD0\n\nI2\n~ 23 meV\nTES\n\nFIG. 1.

GaAs-(001) substrates were used, with a thin, undoped ZnSe buffer layer defining a clean interface for the\nII-VI/III-V heteropitaxy. The ZnMgSe cladding layers\nprevent carrier diffusion into the lower-bandgap GaAs\nsubstrate and spectrally shift the background ZnMgSe\nemission from the F:ZnSe photoluminescence (PL). The\nareal Fluorine impurity \u03b4-doping density was approximately 8 x 109 cm\u22122 . \u03b4-doping was chosen both to ease\nthe isolation of individual impurities by reducing the total number of dopants in the QW, as well as to locate\nthe dopant impurities in the center of the QW. Spatial\nisolation of individual emitters occurred through mesaetching, where selected parts of the Zn(Mg)Se-sandwich\nlayer were chemically removed in a K2 Cr2 O7 :HBr:H2 O\n(1:130:250) etch mixture28 . The nominal diameter of the\nmesas varied from 50 to 400 nm, and the mesas were\ncapped in SiO2 for chemical stability.\nPL characterization was performed in a cold-finger,\nliquid-He cryostat at 10 K, using a 408 nm laser diode\nacting as above-band pump source, similar to the experiments described in Refs. 29,30. The relevant transitions\nare schematically illustrated in Fig. 1(b). A spectrum is\nshown in Fig. 1(c). Note that several peaks are visible: I2\nand the two-electron satellites (TES)19 are related to the\nbound exciton decay, whereas FE-HH and FE-LH represent a continuum of heavy- and light hole free-exciton\nemission respectively. In contrast to the decay into the\nground state (I2 ), the TES are associated with decay into\nexcited states of the bound electron. From a zeroth-order\nBohr-model, these are expected to be redshifted from\nI2 by about 21 meV, which is close to the experimental\nvalue of 23 meV, hence establishing the origin of the emission peaks as related to donor-bound exciton transitions.\nFrom separate, F-concentration dependent growth studies (not shown), we infer its origin as F-impurity bound\nexciton decay.\nIn order to verify whether a single peak corresponds\nto a single emitter, photon correlation measurements\nof g (2) (\u03c4 ) were performed31 . In these experiments, an\naboveband pulsed laser excites the mesa of interest and\nthe emitted photons are frequency-filtered using a grating and a slit. This filtered light is sent to a beamsplitter\nwith a detector at each output arm. Coincidence clicks\nbetween the detectors are counted as a function of the\ndelay, \u03c4 , between those clicks. After normalization by\nsingle detector clicks, the count rate, g (2) (\u03c4 ) gives insight\nto the nature of the light source via its photon statistics.\nIn such a measurement the correlation function g (2) (\u03c4 )\nfor a perfect single emitter without a background approaches zero at zero delay (\u03c4 = 0)5,32 . A mode-locked\nlaser with repetition rate of 76 MHz was used for aboveband pumping, and silicon avalanche-photodiode-based\nsingle-photon-counting modules were used with a timeinterval analyzer for timing photon detection events.\nThe lowest g (2) (0) measured to date in these samples is\n\n15\n\n0.28\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n\n-39\n\n-26\n\n-13\n\n0\n\n39\n\n52\n\n65\n\nTime (ns)\n\nFIG. 2. Non-normalized g (2) (\u03c4 ) correlation function measurement for a 100 nm mesa. Normalized peak values (1 ns integration window around the peaks) are indicated above the\npeaks . Note the g (2) (0)-dip, denoting antibunching, and the\nrepetition rate of 13 ns or 76 MHz.\n\n0.28, as shown in Fig. 2 for a mesa structure with diameter 100 nm, QW-thickness of 5 nm. This value confirms\nthe presence of an individual emitter, since it is less than\nthe threshold value of 0.5 that excludes two or more photons being emitted32 . The origin of the 0.28 background\nis attributed to the presence of nearby emitters, especially from the tail of the free-exciton emission peak.\nWhile the measurement of g (2) (0) establishes F:ZnSe\nas a viable single-photon source, its use as an optically\ncontrollable qubit requires verification of the presence of\na three-level \u039b-system. For this reason, magnetospectroscopy measurements were performed in a 10 T superconducting magnet at 1.5 K. A room-temperature reentrant bore window allowed for a microscope objective\n(working distance: 38 mm, NA: 0.18) to be used for collection of the photoluminescence. Above-band illumination from a CW, 408 nm GaN laser-diode was chosen for\nthe excitation of the sample, and the photoluminescence\nspectrum was collected through a 750 mm spectrometer\non a liquid-N2 -cooled CCD-camera. Both Faraday and\nVoigt geometry data were obtained through the use of\nsmall mirrors inside the cryostat (We refer to the insets\nof Fig. 3(b) and (d) for the respective orientations).\nThe expected energy spectrum as a function of applied\nmagnetic field is shown in Figs. 3(a) and (c) (See also\nRefs. 18, 21, 33, 34 and 35 for a review on magnetospectroscopy of bound-exciton systems). Note that, due to\nthe QW and compressive strain in the ZnSe-layer, the degeneracy between the heavy and light holes is lifted29,30 .\nIn Faraday geometry, a two-fold split of the photoluminescence is observed. This is consistent with the model\nof an exciton bound to an electron-impurity complex.\nFrom the linesplit, we infer a difference in the out-ofk\nplane heavy-hole and electron g-factors (| 3ghh \u2212 ge |) of\n0.8 (\u00b10.2).\n\n\f3\na)\nD 0X\nz\n\u2212 1/ 2\nz\n3/2\nz\n~3g//hh\n\u2212 3/2\nz\n\u03c3+\n\u03c31/ 2\nz\n~ge\n\u2212 1/ 2\nz\n\nD 0X\nLH\n~10\nmeV\nHH\n\nD0\nB\n\nB\n\nz\n\nB\n0T\n\nd)\n1/ 2\n1/ 2\n\n3/2\n\nH V\n\n\u03c3+\n\n9T\n\nB\n\nc)\n\n\u039b\n\n\u03c3-\n\n1/ 2\n\nLH\n~10\nmeV\nHH\nD0\n\nFaraday geometry\n\nb)\n\nz\n\n\u2212 \u2212 1/ 2\n\nz\n\nz\n\n+ \u2212 1/ 2\n\nz\n\nz\n\n\u2212 \u2212 3/2\n\nz\n\n~3g\u2534hh\n3/2\n\nz\n\n1/ 2\nx\n~ge\n\u2212 1/ 2\n\n+ \u2212 3/2\n\nV\n\nVoigt-geometry\nV\nH H\nz\n\nB\nV H\nB\n\n9T\n\nTokyo Special Coordination Funds for Promoting Science\nand Technology, and by the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) through its Funding Program for\nWorld-Leading Innovative R&D on Science and Technology (FIRST Program).

Magnetospectroscopy data for 200 nm diameter\nmesas. a) Energy spectrum in Faraday geometry (D0 X: bound\nexciton, D0 : bound electron, HH: heavy hole, LH: light hole);\nb) PL as function of magnetic field, in Faraday geometry (inset: sample and field alignment in Faraday geometry); c) Energy spectrum in Voigt geometry; note the two \u039b-systems\nwith distinct polarization selection rules; d) PL as function\nof magnetic field in Voigt geometry. (inset: sample and field\nalignment)\n\nThe Voigt geometry data show a fourfold split, with\nlinear polarization, again consistent with donor-boundexciton emission. From the linesplits, we infer an electron g-factor of 1.2 (\u00b10.2), which can be compared with\nthe value of 1.36 for a donor-impurity bound electron\nas obtained by Wolverson et al. through spin-flip Raman scattering36 . The heavy holes in the bound exciton complex are weakly coupled by the magnetic field,\n\u22a5\n|)\nleading to an in-plane heavy-hole g-factor (| 3ghh\nof 0.2 (\u00b10.2). The Voigt data also establish the presence of two doubly-connected \u039b-systems, as illustrated\nin Fig. 3(c), establishing the F:ZnSe system as a candidate for use in several proposed quantum information\ntechnology schemes9\u201313,37 .\nIn conclusion, we isolated the emission of boundexcitons from a single F:ZnSe complex through mesaetching and spectral filtering. These methods establish\nF:ZnSe as a potentially homogeneous and efficient single photon source. The energy splittings from the Faraday and Voigt magneto-photoluminescence data and the\npresence of TES emission firmly establish the presence\nof optically controllable electron spins bound to neutral\ndonors in ZnSe. The potential for nuclear purification of\nthe ZnSe host matrix and fabrication ease makes F:ZnSe\nan attractive candidate for a long-lived, scalable quantum qubit. Future work includes the incorporation of\na microcavity30 to enhance emission and enable efficient\nquantum networking.\nThis work was supported by NICT, MEXT, NIST\n60NANB9D9170, NSF CCR-08 29694, University of\n\n\f4\n31 R.\n\nHanbury Brown and R.
