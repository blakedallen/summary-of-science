We perform a numerical analysis to solve\nboth the radial and angular parts of the scalar field equation, and derive exact results\nfor the Hawking radiation energy emission rate. We find that, in 5 dimensions, as the\nangular momentum increases, the emission rate is suppressed in the low-energy regime\nbut significantly enhanced in the intermediate and high-energy regimes. For higher values\nof n, the Hawking radiation emission rate on the brane is significantly enhanced, with\nthe angular momentum, over the whole energy regime. We also investigate the energy\namplification due to the effect of super-radiance and demonstrate that, in the presence of\nextra dimensions, this effect is again significantly enhanced.\n\n\fDuring the past few years, great interest has been drawn to the concept of transplanckian collisions which can be realized in the framework of theories with Large Extra\nDimensions [1], under the assumption that the colliding particles have a center-of-mass\nenergy s larger than the (4 + n)-dimensional, fundamental Planck scale M\u2217 . During such\nhigh-energy collisions, it is natural to expect that the products will no longer be ordinary\nparticles but heavy objects, arising in the context of a fundamental theory of interactions\nincluding gravity [2].\nSmall, (4+n)-dimensional black holes are one of the possible products of such collisions\n[2, 3, 4]. As long as their mass MBH is larger than a few times the fundamental Planck\nscale M\u2217 , these black holes can be treated as classical, with all the laws of black hole\nphysics applying to them. One of the most important characteristics would then be their\ndecay in time, through the emission of Hawking radiation [5], a characteristic that will\nalso be the most striking observable effect of their existence. The produced black holes,\nafter shedding any additional quantum numbers inherited from the colliding particles, will\nsettle down to Kerr-like, rotating black holes, and a spin-down phase will commence [3],\nin which the black hole angular momentum will be gradually lost through the emission of\nHawking radiation and super-radiance. A Schwarzschild phase describing a non-rotating\nblack hole will follow next with the emission of Hawking radiation resulting in the decrease\nof the black hole mass.\nThe emission of Hawking radiation during the Schwarzschild phase has been studied\nboth analytically [6, 7] and numerically [8] (see [9], for a review and related works),\nhowever the same is not true for the spin-down phase which has been, apart from a few\nexceptions [10, 11], largely ignored. In this short article, we present, for the first time\nin the literature, exact numerical results for the Hawking radiation energy emission rate\ncoming from a (4 + n)-dimensional, rotating black hole. We focus our attention on the\nemission of scalar field radiation on the brane where, according to the assumptions of\nthe model [1], the observer is situated. After formulating the problem, we numerically\nsolve both the angular and radial scalar field equations to determine the exact angular\neigenvalues and radial wavefunction, respectively, for arbitrarily large black hole angular\nmomentum and energy of the emitted particles. Then, we derive the absorption coefficient\nand subsequently the differential energy emission rate for Hawking radiation and the\nenergy spectrum amplification due to the super-radiance effect.\nThe line-element describing a (4 + n)-dimensional, rotating, uncharged black hole was\nfound by Myers and Perry [12]. A black hole created by the collision of particles moving in\na (4 + n)-dimensional spacetime can have up to (n + 3)/2 angular momentum parameters.\nHowever, in the context of the theory with Large Extra Dimensions [1], the colliding\npartons are restricted to propagate on an infinitely-thin 3-brane and therefore they have\na non-zero impact parameter only on a 2-dimensional plane along our brane; thus, it is\nreasonable to assume that they will acquire only one non-zero angular parameter about\nan axis in the brane. The 4-dimensional induced spacetime on the brane, in which the\n\n1\n\n\femitted particles propagate, takes the form [9]\n\u03a3\n\u03bc \u0011 2 2a\u03bc sin2 \u03b8\ndt +\ndt d\u03c6 \u2212 dr 2\nn\u22121\nn\u22121\n\u03a3r\n\u03a3r\n\u2206\n\u0013\n\u0012\na2 \u03bc sin2 \u03b8\nsin2 \u03b8 d\u03c62 ,\n\u2212 \u03a3 d\u03b82 \u2212 r 2 + a2 +\nn\u22121\n\u03a3r\n\n\u0010\nds = 1 \u2212\n2\n\nwhere\n\u2206 = r 2 + a2 \u2212\n\n\u03bc\nr n\u22121\n\nand\n\n\u03a3 = r 2 + a2 cos2 \u03b8 .\n\n(1)\n\n(2)\n\nThe parameters \u03bc and a are related to the mass and angular momentum, respectively, of\nthe black hole through the definitions [12]\nMBH =\n\n(n + 2)An+2\n\u03bc,\n16\u03c0G\n\nJ=\n\n2\nMBH a .\nn+2\n\n(3)\n\nIn the above, G is the (4 + n)-dimensional Newton's constant, and An+2 the area of a\n(n + 2)-dimensional unit sphere given by: An+2 = 2\u03c0 (n+3)/2 /\u0393[(n + 3)/2]. Note that the\ninduced line-element on the brane has an explicit dependence on the number n of extra\ndimensions.\nThe black hole horizon is given by solving \u2206(r) = 0. Unlike the 4D Kerr black hole\nfor which there is an inner and outer solution for rh , for n \u2265 1 there is only one solution\nof this equation. In addition, in the n = 0 and n = 1 cases, there is a maximum possible\nvalue of a, otherwise there are no solutions of \u2206 = 0 and thus no horizon to shield\nthe singularity at r = 0. On the other hand, for n > 1 there is no fundamental upper\nbound on a and a horizon rh always exists. For general n, the horizon radius is given by\nrhn+1 = \u03bc/(1 + a2\u2217 ), where we have defined a\u2217 = a/rh . An upper bound can nevertheless\nbe imposed on the angular momentum parameter of the black hole by demanding the\ncreation of the black hole itself from the collision of the two particles. The maximum\nvalue of the impact parameter between the two particles that can lead to the creation of\na black hole was found to be [13]\n1\n\"\n\u0012\n\u00132 #\u2212 n+1\n1\nn+2\nbmax = 2 1 +\n(4)\n\u03bc n+1 .\n2\nIf we, then, write J = bMBH /2 [11] for the angular momentum of the black hole, and use\nthe second of Eq. (3), we obtain [13]\namax\n=\n\u2217\n\nn+2\n.\n2\n\n(5)\n\nBy using the Newman-Penrose formalism, the equation for the propagation of a field\nwith spin 0, 1/2 and 1, in the gravitational background induced on the brane, can be found\n[9]. Here, we will focus on the emission of scalar fields leaving the analysis for non-zero\nspin fields for a subsequent work [14]. By using the field factorization\n\u03c6(t, r, \u03b8, \u03c6) = e\u2212i\u03c9t eim\u03c6 R(r) Tlm (\u03b8) ,\n2\n\n(6)\n\n\fwhere Tlm (\u03b8) are the so-called spheroidal harmonics [15], we obtain a set of decoupled\nradial and angular equations,\n\u0012\n\u0013 \u0012 2\n\u0013\ndR\nK\nd\nm\n\u2206\n+\n(7)\n\u2212 \u039bl R = 0 ,\ndr\ndr\n\u2206\n\u0012\n\u0013 \u0012\n\u0013\ndTlm (\u03b8)\nm2\n1 d\n2 2\n2\nm\nsin \u03b8\n+ \u2212 2 + a \u03c9 cos \u03b8 + El Tlm (\u03b8) = 0 ,\n(8)\nsin \u03b8 d\u03b8\nd\u03b8\nsin \u03b8\n\nrespectively, where we have defined\n\nK = (r 2 + a2 ) \u03c9 \u2212 am ,\n\nm\n2 2\n\u039bm\nl = El + a \u03c9 \u2212 2am\u03c9 .\n\n(9)\n\nThe Hawking temperature of the (4 + n)-dimensional, rotating black hole is found to\nbe\nTH =\n\n(n + 1) + (n \u2212 1)a2\u2217\n,\n4\u03c0(1 + a2\u2217 )rh\n\n(10)\n\nand leads to the emission of scalar Hawking radiation on the brane, with the corresponding\ndifferential energy emission rate given by the expression\n\u03c9\nd\u03c9\ndE(\u03c9) X\n|Al,m |2\n=\n.\ndt\nexp\n[(\u03c9\n\u2212\nm\u03a9)/T\nH ] \u2212 1 2\u03c0\nl,m\n\n(11)\n\nIn the above, the rotation velocity \u03a9 is defined as\n\u03a9=\n\na\u2217\n,\n(1 + a2\u2217 ) rh\n\n(12)\n\nwhile |Al,m |2 is the absorption probability for a scalar particle propagating in the background induced on the brane (1). Its presence in the expression for the emission rate\nmodifies the blackbody profile of the spectrum due to its explicit dependence on the energy \u03c9 of the emitted particle, its angular momentum numbers (l, m), and the number of\nextra dimensions n. The exact form of |Al,m |2 can be found by solving the radial equation\n(7), a task which we have performed by using numerical analysis. The numerical solution\nobtained for R(r) interpolates between the asymptotic solutions at the horizon of the\nblack hole and infinity. Near the horizon, Eq. (7) leads to the asymptotic solution\n\u2217\n\n\u2217\n\nRh (r \u2217 ) = A1 eikr + A2 e\u2212ikr ,\n\n(13)\n\nwhere A1,2 are integration constants,\nk=\u03c9\u2212\n\nma\n,\n+ a2\n\nrh2\n\n(14)\n\nand r \u2217 is the tortoise coordinate defined by\ndr \u2217\nr 2 + a2\n=\n.\ndr\n\u2206(r)\n3\n\n(15)\n\n\fA boundary condition must be applied in the near-horizon regime, namely that the solution must contain only incoming modes; this is satisfied if we set A1 = 0. On the other\nhand, for fixed a\u2217 and large r, the solution at infinity takes the form\nR\u221e (r) = B1\n\ne\u2212i\u03c9r\nei\u03c9r\n+ B2\n,\nr\nr\n\n(16)\n\nwhere B1,2 are again integration constants.\nHowever, before the numerical integration of Eq. (7) can take place, the value of\nm\nthe constant \u039bm\nl , or equivalently, the angular eigenvalue El , must be determined. The\neigenvalues of the spheroidal harmonics are functions of a\u03c9, and an analytic form can\nbe found only in the limit of small a\u03c9 [16] \u2013 the only work in the literature on the\nHawking radiation coming from a (4 + n)-dimensional, rotating black hole [11] employs\nthis approximate expression for Elm , and the corresponding analysis is valid only in the\nlimit of low energy and low black-hole angular momentum. The exact value of Elm , for\narbitrarily large values of a\u03c9 can be obtained by using a continuation method [17, 13].\nThis is a generalization of perturbation theory which can be applied for arbitrarily large\nchanges in the initial Hamiltonian for which the eigenvalues are known. Here, we briefly\ndescribe this technique for the case s = 0. Equation (8) can be alternatively written as\n(H0 + H1 ) Tlm (\u03b8, a\u03c9) = \u2212Elm (a\u03c9) Tlm(\u03b8, a\u03c9) ,\n\n(17)\n\nwhere H0 stands for the first two terms of the differential operator in Eq. (8), and H1 =\na2 \u03c9 2 cos2 \u03b8. For a\u03c9 = 0, H1 vanishes, and Tlm (\u03b8, 0) reduce to the usual spherical harmonics\nSlm (\u03b8), with Elm (0) = l(l+1). To employ the continuation method, we write the Tlm (\u03b8, a\u03c9)\nfunctions in the basis of the \u03b8-parts of the spherical harmonics:\nX\nm\nm\nTlm (\u03b8, a\u03c9) =\n(18)\nBll\n\u2032 (a\u03c9) Sl\u2032 (\u03b8) .\nl\u2032\n\nBy differentiating Eq. (17) and applying the same techniques as in perturbation theory,\nwe obtain the equation\nX\nd Elm\nm\nm\nBl\u03b1\nBl\u03b2\nh\u03b1|\u03b2i ,\n(19)\n=\u2212\nd(a\u03c9)\n\u03b1,\u03b2\n\nm\nwhere h\u03b1|\u03b2i \u2261 h\u03b1m|dH1/d(a\u03c9)|\u03b2mi. The coefficients Bla\nsatisfy themselves a similar\ndifferential equation, i.e.\n\nX B\u03b3\u03b1 Bl\u03b2\nd Bll\u2032\nh\u03b1|\u03b2i B\u03b3l\u2032 ,\n=\u2212\nd(a\u03c9)\nElm \u2212 E\u03b3m\n\u03b1,\u03b2,\u03b36=l\n\n(20)\n\nm\nwith initial condition Bll\n\u2032 (0) = \u03b4ll\u2032 . By integrating Eqs. (19) and (20), it is possible to\nobtain the eigenvalues of the spheroidal functions for any l and m and for arbitrarily\nlarge values of a\u03c9. This integration was performed numerically by using a Runge-Kutta\nmethod.

(7) and\nderive the solution for the radial function R(r). The integration starts at the horizon of\nthe black hole and proceeds towards infinity. Comparing our numerical results with the\nasymptotic solution at infinity (16), we determine the integration constants B1 and B2 .\nThe absorption probability for scalar fields can then be derived from the relation\nB1\n|Al,m| = 1 \u2212 |Rl,m | = 1 \u2212\nB2\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n,\n\n(21)\n\nwhere Rl,m is the reflection coefficient given by the ratio of the outgoing and ingoing\namplitudes at infinity.\nThe value of the absorption probability |Al,m|2 is then inserted into Eq. (11) to determine the differential energy emission rate per unit time and frequency by the black\nhole on the brane. This rate is shown in Fig. 2, for the case of a 5-dimensional black\nhole (n = 1). For convenience, we assume that the black hole horizon value remains\nfixed, and set rh = 1. Figure 2 shows the emission spectrum on the brane for various\nvalues of the angular momentum parameter a\u2217 , up to the value amax\n= 1.5 defined by\n\u2217\n1\nthe black-hole-creation constraint (5). The dimensionless parameter \u03c9rh on the horizon\u221a\nIn terms of fixed mass parameter \u03bc, the maximum value of a is 0.83 \u03bc. Had the angular momentum\nparameter been allowed to increase indefinitely, the critical value for the existence of the horizon, i.e.\n\u221a\na = \u03bc, would have been reached. For this value, both the black hole horizon and the temperature\nvanish, the latter leading to the suspension of the emission of Hawking radiation. The non-vanishing\n(4)\nvalue of the area of the black hole induced on the brane, given by AH = 4\u03c0(rh2 + a2 ), as opposed to\n(4+n)\nthe vanishing one of the (4 + n)-dimensional black hole, given by AH\n= \u03a92+n rhn (rh2 + a2 ) [with \u03a92+n\nthe solid angle of the (2 + n)-dimensional space], would lead to a substantial suppression of the emission\nof energy in the bulk compared to the one on the brane during these last stages, in addition to the\nsuppression found in the non-rotating case [8, 18].\n1\n\n5\n\n\f0.01\n\na*=1.5\n\nrh d2 E/dt d\u03c9\n\n0.008\n\nGeometrical optics\n\n0.006\n\na*=0\n\n0.004\n\na*=1.0\n\n0.002\n\nPSfrag replacements\n\na*=0.5\n0\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n\u03c9 rh\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\nFigure 2: Power spectra for scalar emission on the brane from rotating black holes, for\nn = 1 and various values of a\u2217 .\n\ntal axis adequately covers the low, intermediate and high-energy regimes. The different\ncurves in the figure allow us to compare the energy emission rates for black holes with the\nsame horizon radius and different angular momentum. When rh is kept fixed, as in this\ncase, the temperature of the black hole decreases sharply with a\u2217 , leading to the observed\nsuppression of the energy emission rate in the low-energy regime \u2013 this is in agreement\nwith the behaviour found by analytical methods in the low \u03c9 and low a limit [11]. As the\nenergy increases further, however, the absorption probability is significantly enhanced;\nthis enhancement gradually overcomes the decrease in the black hole temperature leading\nto the observed increase in the energy emission rate, as a\u2217 increases, both in the intermediate and high-energy regimes. This in turn leads to a significant enhancement of the\ntotal emissivity of a 5-dimensional rotating black hole (that is, energy emitted per unit\ntime over the whole frequency band) compared to that of a non-rotating black hole of the\nsame dimensionality.\nThe numerical results produced above allowed the statement made in [3], according\nto which the emission of Hawking radiation is dominated by modes with l = m, to be\ntested. We have found that Fig. 2 looks the same at the \u223c 90% level if only the l = m\nmodes are included in the sum of Eq. (11), a result that confirms this statement.\nKeeping the black hole horizon value rh fixed during our analysis was a convenient\nchoice from a calculational point of view. However, as a varies, this leads to the comparison\nof energy emission rates for black holes with different masses. From a phenomenological\npoint of view, fixing the mass parameter \u03bc of the black hole, instead, makes more sense.\nIn Fig. 3, we present the energy emission spectrum on the brane for a 6-dimensional\nblack hole, i.e. for n = 2. The angular momentum parameter now varies from zero to\nthe maximum value \u2013 derived from Eqs. (4)-(5) \u2013 of amax = 1.17 M\u2217\u22121 , where M\u2217 is the\n\n6\n\n\f0.035\n0.030\n\nrh d2 E/dt d\u03c9\n\na=1.17\n\n0.025\na=1.0\n\n0.020\na=0.8\n\n0.015\n\na=0.6\n\n0.010\n\nPSfrag replacements\n\na=0.4\n\n0.005\n\na=0\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n\u03c9\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\n(in units of M\u2217 )\n\n3\n\nFigure 3: Power spectra for scalar emission on the brane from rotating black holes, for\nn = 2 and various values of a in units of M\u2217\u22121 .\n\nfundamental Planck scale. For fixed \u03bc, the black hole temperature again decreases2 , as\na increases; however, the increase in this case is only a mild one, which allows for the\nenhancement of the absorption probability to dominate the spectrum. This leads to a\nsignificant enhancement of the energy emission rate on the brane in all energy regimes,\nand thus to a clear enhancement of the total emissivity of a rotating black hole compared\nto the one of a non-rotating black hole with the same mass.\nAn interesting effect which takes place during the propagation of a bosonic field in\nthe background of a rotating black hole is super-radiance [19], that is, the amplification of\nthe amplitude of the incident wave. This becomes manifest when the reflection probability becomes larger than unity, or equivalently when the absorption probability becomes\nnegative. In the context of a higher-dimensional model, the only studies in the literature\nare an analytic approach [10] which confirmed super-radiance for bulk scalars incident on\nfive-dimensional black holes, and a sole numerical result for n = 6 and l = m = 1 [20]. In\nthe context of our numerical analysis, we have investigated this effect for various values\nof the angular momentum of the black hole and number of extra dimensions. In Fig. 4,\nwe compare the energy amplification due to super-radiant scattering of scalar fields for\na 4-dimensional, maximally-rotating black hole with a\u2217 = 1 (equivalent to a = MBH ),\nand a 6-dimensional black hole with again a\u2217 = 1. The vertical axis is the absorption\nprobability (in fact \u2212|\u00c2l,m|2 ) expressed as a percentage so that it gives the percentage\nenergy amplification of the incident wave. Figure 4(a) shows excellent agreement with the\nresults produced for n = 0 and a\u2217 = 1 in [21]. Comparing the vertical axes of Figs. 4(a)\nand 4(b), we clearly see that, in the presence of extra dimensions, the peak amplification\nis more significant. For small values of a\u2217 , it is found that the l = m = 1 mode provides\n2\n\nTo be exact, the temperature decreases up to the point a = 1.1 M\u2217\u22121 , and then starts increasing up\nto a\n= 1.17 M\u2217\u22121; however, the increase in its value is only 0.5%, which leads to no observable effect.\nmax\n\n7\n\n\f1\n\n10\n\n=1\nl= m\n3\nm=\n=\nl\n=4\nm\nl= PSfrag\nm\n=\n\n5\n\n0.01\n\nreplacements\n\n0.001\n\n0.0001\n\nEnergy amplification (%)\n\n1\n\n=2\nl= m\n\nl=\n\nPSfrag replacements\n\nEnergy amplification (%)\n\n0.1\n\n0.1\n\n0.01\n\n=1\nl= m\n=2\nl= m\n3\nm=\nl= = 4\nm 5\nl= m=\nl=2, m=1\nl=\n\n0.001\n\n0.0001\n\nl=2, m=1\n0.00001\n\n0.00001\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\n0.4\n\n\u03c9/m\u03a9\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\n\u03c9/m\u03a9\n\nFigure 4: (a) Super-radiant scattering of scalars by a maximally rotating (a\u2217 = 1) 4dimensional black hole; (b) Super-radiant scattering of scalars by an induced-on-the-brane\n6-dimensional black hole with a\u2217 = 1.\n\nthe greatest amplification as in the 4-dimensional case. However, for larger values of a\u2217\nor n, the maximum amplification can occur in modes with larger values of l: for n = 6,\nand a\u2217 = 4.0, the maximum energy amplification is found to be around 9% and occurs in\nthe l = m = 7 mode.\nIn summary, in this work we have studied the emission of Hawking radiation in the\nform of scalar fields from a (4 + n)-dimensional, rotating black hole on the brane. We have\nperformed a numerical analysis to solve both the radial and angular parts of the scalar\nfield equation on the brane, and derived exact results for the Hawking radiation energy\nemission rate. We found that in the case of a 5-dimensional black hole, the emission rate is\nsuppressed in the low-energy regime, as the angular momentum increases \u2013 in agreement\nwith previous approximate results \u2013 but is significantly enhanced in the intermediate and\nhigh-energy regimes, that were until now unexplored. We have extended our analysis to\nblack holes of higher-dimensionality and, as an illustrative example, we have presented\nthe spectrum of a 6-dimensional black hole: in this case, the energy emission rate on the\nbrane is enhanced with the angular momentum over the whole energy band, a behaviour\nthat persists for all higher values of n. We have also investigated the amplification of\nthe incident wave due to the effect of superradiance, and showed that this effect is also\nsignificantly enhanced in the presence of extra dimensions.\nAcknowledgments We would like to thank B.
