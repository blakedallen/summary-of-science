INTRODUCTION\n\nThe dark matter distribution at the centers of galaxies has been intensively debated ever since the advent of high-resolution \u039bCDM simulations. The existence of central cusps in dark matter halos was found\nin numerical simulations (Dubinski & Carlberg 1991;\nNavarro, Frenk & White 1996, 1997; Moore et al. 1999;\nGhigna et al. 2000; Klypin et al. 2001; Power et al. 2002;\nStoehr et al. 2003; Navarro et al. 2004; Reed et al. 2005;\nDiemand et al. 2008) but challenged by the observations. The latter support a core-like density distribution at the centers of galaxies (Flores & Primack 1994;\nMoore 1994; de Blok et al. 2001; de Blok & Bosma 2002;\nBolatto et al. 2002; Weldrake et al. 2003; Simon et al.\n2003; Swaters et al. 2003; Gentile et al. 2004; Oh et al.\n2008; Trachternach et al. 2008; de Blok et al. 2008, and\nreferences therein). A detailed observational review\non where the \"cusp/core\" problem stands is given by\nElectronic address: seheon oh@ast.uct.ac.za\nElectronic address: edeblok@ast.uct.ac.za\nElectronic address: E.Brinks@herts.ac.uk\nElectronic address: walter@mpia.de\nElectronic address: robk@ast.cam.ac.uk\n1 Department of Astronomy, University of Cape Town, Private\nBag X3, Rondebosch 7701, South Africa\n2 Centre for Astrophysics Research, University of Hertfordshire,\nCollege Lane, Hatfield, AL10 9AB, United Kingdom\n3 Max-Planck-Institut f\u00fcr Astronomie, K\u00f6nigstuhl 17, 69117\nHeidelberg, Germany\n4 Institute of Astronomy, University of Cambridge, Madingley\nRoad, Cambridge CB3 0HA, United Kingdom\n5 Square Kilometre Array South African Fellow\n\nde Blok (2010).\nOf particular interest has been the assumption that\nthe observations suffer from various systematic uncertainties and that the central cusps can be \"hidden\" this way (Swaters 1999; van den Bosch et al.\n2000; van den Bosch & Swaters 2001; Swaters et al.\n2003; Simon et al. 2003; Rhee et al. 2004). These uncertainties consist of certain observational systematic effects as well as the uncertainty in the stellar mass-tolight ratios (\u03a5\u22c6 ) of the stellar component. The observational systematic effects, such as beam smearing (for\nlow-resolution radio observations), dynamical center offsets (for slit observations) and non-circular motions affect the derived dark matter distribution in galaxies in\nsuch a way that the apparent inner density slopes of dark\nmatter halos are flattened. In addition, the fairly unconstrained \u03a5\u22c6 also affects the derived distribution of dark\nmatter in galaxies (e.g., van Albada & Sancisi 1986).\nThe best way to minimize these uncertainties is to\nuse high-quality data of dark matter-dominated objects.\nHigh-quality data (\u223c7\u2032\u2032 angular; \u2264 5.2 km s\u22121 velocity\nresolution) of dwarf galaxies taken from \"The Hi Nearby\nGalaxy Survey\" (THINGS; Walter et al. 2008) significantly reduce the systematic effects inherent in lowerquality data and thus provide a good opportunity for\naddressing the dark matter distribution near the centers of galaxies. Dwarf galaxies which are dark matterdominated, like low surface brightness (LSB) galaxies\n(de Blok & McGaugh 1997), are ideal objects for the\nstudy of dark matter (e.g., Prada & Burkert 2002) because of the small contribution of baryons to the to-\n\n\f2\n\nOh et al.\nTABLE 1\nProperties of the THINGS dwarf galaxies\nName\n\nIC 2574\nNGC 2366\nHolmberg I\nHolmberg II\nM81 dwB\nDDO 53\nDDO 154\n\nR.A.\n(h m s)\n(1)\n10\n07\n09\n08\n10\n08\n12\n\n28\n28\n40\n19\n05\n34\n54\n\n27.7\n53.4\n32.3\n03.7\n30.9\n06.5\n05.7\n\nDec.\n(\u25e6 \u2032 \u2032\u2032 )\n(2)\n+68\n+69\n+71\n+70\n+70\n+66\n+27\n\n24\n12\n11\n43\n21\n10\n09\n\n59\n51\n08\n24\n51\n48\n10\n\nD\n(Mpc)\n(3)\n\nVsys\n(km s\u22121 )\n(4)\n\nhP.A.i\n(\u25e6 )\n(5)\n\nhiTR i\n(\u25e6 )\n(6)\n\nhiBTF i\n(\u25e6 )\n(7)\n\nz0\n(kpc)\n(8)\n\nMetal.\n(Z\u2299 )\n(9)\n\nMB\n(mag)\n(10)\n\nMdyn\n(109 M\u2299 )\n(11)\n\n4.0\n3.4\n3.8\n3.4\n5.3\n3.6\n4.3\n\n53\n104\n140\n156\n346\n18\n375\n\n53\n39\n45\n175\n311\n131\n229\n\n55\n63\n13\n49\n44\n27\n66\n\n46\n50\n10\n25\n59\n23\n55\n\n0.57\n0.34\n0.55\n0.28\n0.09\n0.14\n0.20\n\n0.20\n0.10\n0.12\n0.17\n0.21\n0.11\n0.05\n\n-18.11\n-17.17\n-14.80\n-16.87\n-14.23\n-13.45\n-14.23\n\n14.62\n4.29\n0.46\n2.07\n0.30\n0.45\n5.40\n\nNote. - (1)(2): Center positions derived from a tilted-ring analysis in Section 3.4.

In particular the high linear resolution of \u223c0.2 kpc (assuming a median distance of 4\nMpc) achieved by THINGS is necessary to resolve the inner slope of the density profile and distinguish between\ncusp- and core-like density profiles near the centers of\ngalaxies. Moreover, \"Spitzer Infrared Nearby Galaxies\nSurvey\" (SINGS; Kennicutt et al. 2003) data are available for our sample galaxies. The SINGS near-IR images\nprovide virtually dust-free pictures of the old stellar populations in galaxies. This allows us to make reliable mass\nmodels for the stellar component of a galaxy.\nWe select 7 dwarf galaxies from THINGS that show\na clear rotation pattern in their velocity fields to derive\ntheir rotation curves. Although some of them have been\nanalyzed before, a more careful kinematic analysis is useful to derive a more accurate dark matter distribution\nin these slowly rotating galaxies. In the previous analysis (e.g., Martimbeau et al. 1994; Hunter et al. 2001;\nBureau & Carignan 2002 etc.), the intensity-weighted\nmean velocity field which is most likely affected by noncircular motions in galaxies was used and the asymmetric\ndrift correction was usually not addressed. Both noncircular motions and pressure support tend to induce a\nlower observed rotation velocity than the true one.\nIn general four different types of non-circular motions\nin galaxies can be distinguished on the basis of velocity\nfields (Bosma 1978): (1) Motions associated with spiral\narms. The streaming motions caused by the arms distort the velocity field in a regular fashion (e.g., M81);\n(2) Large-scale symmetric deviations. The radial change\nof the kinematical major axis' position angle distorts\nthe velocity field, while still having a central symmetry.\nThese velocity distortions are known as \"oval\" distortions\nwhen encountered in the inner region, and as a \"warp\"\nwhen they occur in the outer region, respectively; (3)\nLarge-scale asymmetries. The tidal interaction with a\nneighbouring galaxy causes asymmetries mainly in the\nouter regions of galaxies (e.g., M81; Yun et al. 1994); (4)\nSmall-scale asymmetries. Various sources, such as supernova (SN) explosions and stellar winds from young stars\n(e.g., OB associations), locally stir up the bulk motion\nof gas and give rise to random motions. These are usually visible as \"kinks\" in iso-velocity contours of velocity\nfields.\n\nOf these, small-scale random motions can be classified\nas additional components of the velocity profiles in the\nHi data cube and result in asymmetric profiles. Therefore, a single Gaussian function cannot properly model\nthese (non-Gaussian) velocity profiles. To minimize the\neffect of these random non-circular motions in our sample galaxies, we use the \"bulk\" velocity fields described in\nOh et al. (2008). We compare the bulk rotation curves\nwith those derived from other types of velocity fields,\nsuch as the intensity-weighted mean, peak, single Gaussian fit and hermite h3 . In addition, we correct for the\nasymmetric drift for the galaxies where the pressure support is significant with respect to the circular rotation.\nWe then obtain dark matter mass models of the galaxies\nusing \u03a5\u22c6 as derived in Oh et al. (2008). From this, we\naddress the \"cusp/core\" problem by comparing the derived dark matter distribution of our galaxies with that\nof \u039bCDM simulations.\nThis paper is set out as follows. In Section 2, we give\na general description of the data used. In Section 3, we\npresent the rotation curves of the THINGS dwarf galaxies. The mass models for the baryons are presented in\nSection 4. The measured dark matter fractions of the\ngalaxies are given in Section 5, and their relation to the\ngalaxy properties is discussed. In Section 6, the derived\ndark matter distribution of the galaxies is discussed with\nrespect to the fit quality of the halo models used, the\nrotation curve shape and the inner density slope. Lastly,\nthe main results of this paper are summarized in Section 7. Data and kinematic analysis of individual galaxies are presented in the Appendix.\n\n2. DATA\n\nWe use high-resolution Hi data of 7 nearby (\u223c4\nMpc) dwarf galaxies from THINGS undertaken with the\nNRAO1 Very Large Array (VLA) to derive the dark matter distribution in these systems.

SINGS IRAC 3.6\u03bcm data2 (with a resolution of \u223c 4\u2032\u2032 ) are used to separate the contribution\nof stars from the total kinematics. In addition, ancillary\noptical broadband (B, V and R) images of the sample\ngalaxies taken with the 2.1m telescope at Kitt Peak National Observatory (KPNO) as part of the SINGS survey\nare used. The data used in this paper are presented in\nthe Appendix. IC 2574 and NGC 2366 have already been\npublished in Oh et al. (2008). However, we here make\nfurther use of the plots by extending the analysis. For a\nconsistency with other galaxies presented in this paper,\nwe show the old plots again together with some new results. Some of the galaxies (e.g., Ho I and DDO 53) have\nlow inclinations (< 30 \u25e6 ). The effect of inclination on the\nrotation curves will be discussed in Section 3.4.\n3. ROTATION CURVES\n3.1. Velocity field types\n\nAs a first step towards deriving the rotation curve of\na galaxy, we need to extract the velocity field from the\ndata cube. The velocity field contains the entire 2D distribution of velocities and is therefore less prone to systematic uncertainties in deriving rotation curves, e.g.,\ndue to pointing offset and non-circular motions, than\none-dimensional long-slit spectra (Zackrisson et al. 2006;\nde Blok et al. 2008).\nA velocity field can be derived in many different ways.\nThe most popular ones are the intensity-weighted mean\n(IWM), peak, single Gaussian fit and hermite velocity\nfields (see de Blok et al. 2008). For a highly resolved\ngalaxy that is not affected by non-circular motions, these\nvelocity fields are nearly identical to each other and the\nrotation curves derived are also similar. However, for a\ngalaxy with dynamics severely affected by non-circular\nmotions, the resulting rotation curves from the different types of velocity fields show significant differences.\nTherefore, we have to examine the various types of velocity fields for a galaxy and determine which is the least\naffected by non-circular motions and the most appropriate for deriving an accurate rotation curve. In the following sections, we briefly introduce the velocity fields\nmentioned above, as well as the bulk velocity field first\nproposed by Oh et al. (2008).\n3.1.1. Intensity-weighted mean velocity field (1st\n\nmoment map)\nThe IWM velocity field has been the most widely used\nvelocity field tracing intensity-weighted velocities along\nthe line-of-sight through a galaxy (Warner et al. 1973).\nThe intensity-weighted mean velocity of a profile in a\ndata cube at a given line-of-sight for a galaxy is given as,\nR\u221e\ndvI(x, y, v)v\nVIWM (x, y) = R\u2212\u221e\n,\n(1)\n\u221e\n\u2212\u221e dvI(x, y, v)\nwhere I(x, y, v) is the flux of the profile in the data cube\nat a given sky position (x, y) and is a function of velocity\nv. Mapping the velocities weighted by I(x, y, v) over the\nentire area of a galaxy gives the IWM velocity field. As\nthis method does not depend on profile fitting, it provides a robust estimate of velocity even for asymmetric\n2 NGC 2366 is not targeted in SINGS observations but retrieved\nfrom the Spitzer archive\n\nFig. 1.- Schematic Hi profiles with different asymmetries. The\ngray dashed lines represent the bulk motion and the light-gray\ndotted lines indicate an additional non-circular component. The\nblack solid lines are the resulting profiles combining both the bulk\nand non-circular motions. As the non-circular component increases\nfrom the top to bottom panels the asymmetry of the resulting profile also increases. The long light-gray arrows in all panels indicate\nthe central velocity of the bulk motion profile. The short black arrows in all panels indicate the derived velocity from the IWM, peak,\nsingle Gaussian fit, and hermite h3 polynomial fit. The larger the\nasymmetry of a profile, the larger the velocity deviation from the\nbulk motion. In case the non-circular motion does not dominate\nthe bulk motion (upper two rows), the derived velocity is close to\nthat of the bulk motion and peak and hermite h3 velocities give an\nequally good result. However, if the non-circular motion dominates\nthe bulk motion (lower two rows), the derived velocity deviates\nsignificantly from the bulk velocity even if we use the hermite h3\npolynomial fit.\n\nprofiles with a low S/N. If a profile in the data cube is\nsymmetric with respect to its central velocity, then the\nIWM field properly traces the central velocity at which\nthe peak flux is found. However, it begins to deviate\nfrom the central velocity of a profile, as the asymmetry\nof the profile increases. A schematic example of this is\nshown in Fig. 1.\n3.1.2. Peak velocity fields\n\nTracing the velocities at which the peak fluxes of the\nprofiles in a data cube are found can be an alternative\nway of determining the line-of-sight velocities of a galaxy.\nThis type of velocity field is called a peak-intensity velocity field. Since no fitting procedure is required, this\nmethod is simple and fast. Unlike the IWM method,\nthis method is able to trace the velocities at which the\nhighest fluxes are found, even for profiles showing significant asymmetries. In this respect, the peak velocity is\nthe preferred velocity compared to the ones derived using other methods. However, this method is sensitive to\nthe noise in profiles with low S/N in which case it fails to\nextract proper line-of-sight velocities. See de Blok et al.\n(2008) for more discussions.\n3.1.3. Single Gaussian velocity fields\n\n\f4\n\nOh et al.\n\nIt is possible to fit a single Gaussian function to the\nvelocity profiles. A Gaussian function depends on three\nparameters and is given as follows:\n\u0012\n\u0013\n(v \u2212 v0 )2\nVGauss (v) = A exp \u2212\n,\n(2)\n2\u03c3 2\nwhere v0 and \u03c3 are the central velocity and velocity dispersion of a profile. Due to the assumption on the shape\nof the profiles (i.e., Gaussian function), this is less sensitive to the noise or (modest) asymmetries of profiles. In\naddition, the least squares fit procedure provides robust\nestimates of velocities, even for profiles with low S/N\nvalues. The single Gaussian velocity field is best used in\nprofiles where the FWHM is comparable to the velocity\nresolution (de Blok et al. 2008). However, this method\nstill suffers from significant profile asymmetries induced\nby non-circular motions or projection effects of a galaxy.\nAs shown in Fig. 1, the derived velocities from the single Gaussian fit can deviate from the peak velocities of\nasymmetric profiles, although this method provides better results than the IWM method.\n3.1.4. Hermite h3 polynomials\n\nIt is also possible to use the Gauss-Hermite polynomial\n(van der Marel & Franx 1993) to model the skewness of\na non-Gaussian profile. In addition, the Gauss-Hermite\npolynomial also has a parameter called h4 , which measures the kurtosis of a profile. However, to minimize\nthe number of free parameters, this term is not usually\nused when fitting the function. As the skewness is built\ninto the profile, it is efficiently applicable to profiles with\nsignificant asymmetries. Compared to the peak velocity\nfield, hermite h3 polynomials give more stable results,\neven for profiles with low S/N values. Hermite h3 polynomials have been used to extract the velocity fields of\nthe galaxies from THINGS (de Blok et al. 2008).\n3.1.5. Bulk velocity fields\n\nA velocity profile in a data cube can consist of multiple\ncomponents if there are additional components moving\nat different velocities with respect to the underlying rotation of a galaxy. Until now, we have assumed that\nthe underlying rotation of a galaxy is the dominant motion in a galaxy. This assumption leads us to choose the\npeak-intensity velocity in a fitted or raw velocity profile\nas the most representative velocity. This, however, only\nholds for a case where the majority of the gas moves\nat this velocity. Any additional components present in\na velocity profile are then considered to be non-circular\nmotions that deviate from the bulk rotation. But this is\nnot true for a profile where non-circular motions dominate the kinematics of a galaxy. In this case, even if a\nprofile is decomposed successfully with multiple components, no clues exist as to which component is the bulk\nmotion and which ones are the non-circular motions. We\ntherefore need additional constraints to distinguish the\nbulk motion and non-circular motions among such decomposed components.\nTo this end, Oh et al. (2008) proposed a new method\nto extract circularly rotating velocity components from\nthe Hi data cube and derive a so-called bulk velocity field.\nThis type of velocity field efficiently separates small-scale\nrandom motions from the underlying rotation of a galaxy\n\nand extracts the bulk velocity. See de Blok et al. (2008)\nfor the comparison of the various types of velocity fields.\nThis method has been successfully used for two galaxies\nthat are significantly affected by non-circular motions:\nIC 2574 and NGC 2366 (Oh et al. 2008).\nWe extract the various types of velocity fields (i.e.,\nIWM, single Gaussian, hermite h3 polynomial, and the\npeak and bulk velocity fields) from the Hi data cubes\nof our sample galaxies and use them to derive rotation curves, as described in the following section. The\nnatural-weighted cubes are used for this and no residual scaling, primary beam correction or blanking3 is applied to preserve the noise characteristics. The extracted\nvelocity fields of the 7 THINGS dwarf galaxies are presented in the Appendix.\n3.2. Tilted-ring analysis\n\nUsing rotcur in GIPSY (Begeman 1989), we fit a\ntilted-ring model to the bulk velocity field of the galaxies to derive the ring parameters that best describe the\nobserved velocity fields. We then apply these tilted-ring\nmodels obtained from the bulk velocity field to the other\nvelocity fields to examine the effect of the type of velocity\nfield on the derived rotation curve. We show the rotation curves derived from different types of velocity fields\nof the sample galaxies in the Appendix. We will compare\nand discuss these rotation curves in Section 3.4.\n3.3. Asymmetric drift correction\n\nPressure support plays an important role in galaxies\nwhose velocity dispersions are large enough compared to\ntheir maximum rotation velocities (Bureau & Carignan\n2002). This is the case for the galaxies in our sample\nwhose typical maximum rotation velocities (Vmax ) are\nless than \u223c35 km s\u22121 , except for IC 2574 (\u223c80 km s\u22121 )\nand NGC 2366 (\u223c60 km s\u22121 ). In order to obtain more\nreliable rotation velocities for these galaxies, we need to\ncorrect for the asymmetric drift. Following the method\ndescribed in Bureau & Carignan (2002), we correct for\nthe asymmetric drift as follows,\n2\n2\n2\nVcor\n= Vrot\n+ \u03c3D\n,\n\n(3)\n\nwhere Vrot is the rotation velocity derived from the simple\nfit of a tilted-ring model to the velocity field and Vcor is\nthe asymmetric drift corrected velocity. The asymmetric\ndrift correction \u03c3D is given as,\n\u2202ln(\u03c1\u03c3 2 )\n\u2202R\n2\n2 \u2202ln(\u03a3\u03c3 )\n,\n(4)\n= \u2212R\u03c3\n\u2202R\nwhere \u03c3 and \u03c1 are the velocity dispersion and volume\ndensity of Hi, and R is the radius of a galaxy. In particular, \u03c1 can be converted to the Hi surface density \u03a3 by\nassuming an exponential distribution in the vertical direction and a constant scale height (for a 1st approximation). For the surface density \u03a3 and velocity dispersion\n\u03c3, we use the integrated Hi (0th moment) and velocity\ndispersion (2nd moment) maps, respectively. Using the\ntilted-ring model derived earlier from the bulk velocity\n2\n\u03c3D\n= \u2212R\u03c3 2\n\n3 Except in the determination of the bulk velocity field. See\nOh et al. (2008) for a detailed description.\n\n\fDark and luminous matter in THINGS dwarf galaxies\nfield, we obtain the corrected radial profiles of \u03a3 and \u03c3.\nTo avoid large fluctuations in the derivative in Eq. 4, we\nfit \u03a3\u03c3 2 with an analytical function,\n\u03a3\u03c3 2 (R) =\n\nI0 (R0 + 1)\n,\nR0 + e\u03b1R\n\n(5)\n\nwhere I0 and R0 are the fitted values in units of\nM\u2299 pc\u22122 km2 s\u22122 and arcsec, respectively. \u03b1 is given in\nunit of arcsec\u22121 . The resulting profiles of \u03c3D and \u03a3\u03c3(R)\nfor the galaxies where the asymmetric drift corrections\nare needed are shown in the Appendix.\n3.4. The rotation curves of THINGS dwarf galaxies\nThe resulting rotation curves of the individual galaxies\nderived using different types of velocity fields and their\ncomparison are given in the Appendix. Below we discuss\nthe rotation curves derived using the bulk velocity\nfield and corrected for asymmetric drift, where needed,\nin order to examine the effect of small-scale random\nnon-circular motions.\n\n\u2022 IC 2574: IC 2574 is affected by non-circular motions (Walter & Brinks 1999) and this is clearly seen as\n\"kinks\" in the iso-velocity contours of the velocity fields\nas shown in Fig. A.1. The spatial locations of these smallscale random motions are also found in the non-circular\nmotion velocity field (hereafter NONC velocity field) as\nshown in panel (k) of Fig. A.1. As described in Oh et al.\n(2008), the NONC velocity field only contains the velocities of the primary (i.e., strongest intensity) components\namong the decomposed ones at the positions where these\nprimary components were found to track the non-circular\nmotions.\nFor a quantitative analysis of non-circular motions,\nwe expand the velocity fields into harmonic terms\nup to the 3rd order, cn and sn (n = 1, 2 and 3)\n(Schoenmakers et al. 1997; see also Trachternach et al.\n2008 for an extensive discussion of the method). As\nshown in Fig. A.2, the amplitudes of harmonic terms\n(e.g., c2 , s1 and s2 ; corrected for inclination) decomposed using the hermite h3 velocity field are \u223c10 km s\u22121\nin the inner regions. However, the results from the bulk\nvelocity fields are less than 5 km s\u22121 over all radii.\nIn general, small-scale random motions tend to\nresult in a lower rotation velocity than the true one\nas they make the velocity gradients along the receding\nand approaching sides of a galaxy less steep. This is\nparticularly prominent for the rotation velocity derived\nusing the IWM velocity field which is most affected by\nnon-circular motions. As shown in Fig. 2, the rotation\ncurves derived from the other types of velocity field\nare largely consistent with each other. At \u223c4 kpc\nwhere non-circular motions caused by a super-giant\nshell are significant (see Walter et al. 1998), the velocity\ndifferences between the bulk and both the IWM and\nhermite h3 curves are about \u223c11 km s\u22121 and \u223c7 km s\u22121 ,\nrespectively. For the kinematic analysis of IC 2574, we\ntherefore use the bulk rotation velocity which is less\naffected by these random motions and thus provides\na better description of the underlying kinematics. We\nrefer to Oh et al. (2008) for a complete discussion on\nthe rotation curve analysis.\n\n5\n\n\u2022 NGC 2366: In Fig. A.5, the distorted iso-velocity\ncontours of the velocity fields indicate that most disturbances caused by non-circular motions are present in the\nouter regions (> 5 kpc), especially in the north-western\npart of the galaxy. This is also confirmed by the NONC\nvelocity field in the (l) panel of Fig. A.5, and large amplitudes (\u223c10 km s\u22121 ) of harmonic terms in Fig. A.6.\nHowever, these disturbances are largely removed in the\nbulk velocity field as shown in Fig. A.5.\nIn Fig. A.7, we compare the derived rotation\ncurves with those from the literature (Swaters 1999;\nHunter et al. 2001; van Eymeren et al. 2009).\nThe\nHunter et al. (2001)4 and the THINGS IWM curves are\nsystematically lower than the bulk rotation curve. This\nis not due to different inclination assumption since an\ninclination of \u223c65 \u25e6 which is similar to our value (\u223c63 \u25e6 )\nwas used for the Hunter et al. (2001) curve. Instead,\nthe velocity difference can be due to non-circular\nmotions in the galaxy. This idea is supported by a\nsignificant velocity difference beyond \u223c5 kpc where\nstrong non-circular motions are present as discussed\nabove. In addition we also compare the hermite h3\ncurve with that derived using the same THINGS h3\nvelocity field by van Eymeren et al. (2009). They used\na slightly different center position (\u223c20 \u2032\u2032 in declination)\nand a lower systemic velocity (98 km s\u22121 ) but similar\ninclination (\u223c63 \u25e6) and position angle (\u223c43 \u25e6 ). The\nvan Eymeren et al. (2009) curve agrees well with our\nhermite h3 curve but is systematically lower than the\nbulk rotation curve. As in the case of IC 2574, we\nadopt the bulk rotation curve for the mass modeling of\nNGC 2366. We refer to Oh et al. (2008) for a complete\ndiscussion on the rotation curve analysis.\n\u2022 Ho I: The inclination of Ho I is the lowest among\nour galaxies. Therefore, the projected velocities, V sin i\n(where V and i are the circular rotation velocity and\nthe inclination) of the galaxy are small, and more sensitive to the effect of non-circular motions. As can be\nseen in Fig. A.9, the iso-velocity contours of the velocity\nfields are severely distorted, particularly in the central\nand north-western regions of the galaxy. The NONC\nvelocity field in Fig. A.9 also indicates the presence of\nstrong non-circular motions in these regions as confirmed\nby inspection of position-velocity cuts along the kinematical major and minor axes (Ott et al. 2001). In addition,\nthe harmonic analysis of the bulk velocity field which is\nalready corrected for non-circular motions shows large\namplitudes (\u223c10 km s\u22121 ) of the decomposed harmonic\nterms in Fig. A.10.\nTo minimize the effect of the non-circular motions, we\nderive the rotation curve using the bulk velocity field in\nFig. A.9. The derived ring parameters, such as the kinematic center, the systemic velocity and the position angle are consistent with those found by Ott et al. (2001).\nThe rotation curve keeps increasing out to \u223c1.5 kpc and\ndecreases beyond that. This also agrees well with the result by Ott et al. (2001), converted using the inclination\nof 14 \u25e6 .\nHowever, the small inclination value of 14 \u25e6 implies\nconsiderable uncertainty in the rotation curve. To check\nthis we compare the rotation curves derived using in4\n\nAn IWM velocity field was used.\n\n\f6\n\nOh et al.\n\nFig. 2.- (a): Comparison of the bulk rotation curve of IC 2574 with rotation curves derived using other types of velocity fields as\ndenoted in the panel (i.e., IWM, hermite h3 , single Gaussian and peak velocity fields). The Martimbeau et al. (1994) curve was derived\nusing an IWM velocity field with a lower resolution. They adopted a large value for the inclination (\u223c75\u25e6 ). The IWM rotation curve which\nis most likely affected by random non-circular motions is the lowest among the others. See Section 3.4 for more details. (b)(c): The radial\nmass surface density profiles of the stellar and gas components of IC 2574, respectively. (d)(e): The resulting rotation velocities of the\nstellar and gas components of IC 2574 derived from the surface density profiles given in the panels (b) and (c), respectively. More details\ncan be found in Section 4.\n\nclinations deviating \u00b110 \u25e6 from our adopted value (see\nthe INCL panel of Fig. A.10). In the VROT panel of\nFig. A.10, we find significant differences between them.\nIn particular, the rotation curve derived using the low\ninclination value (\u223c4 \u25e6 ) significantly deviates from our\npreferred curve. However, the value of \u223c4 \u25e6 falls at the\nextreme lower end of the inclinations derived from the\ntilted-ring fits. For reference, we show a fit result with\nonly the INCL left free (indicated by gray dots in the\nINCL panel of Fig. A.10). The values are systematically\nlarger than those (open circles) derived keeping all parameters free. From this we conclude that it is unlikely\nthat Ho I has an inclination as small as \u223c4 \u25e6 and we adopt\na value of 14 \u25e6 for the remainder of this paper. Notwithstanding the low inclination, we will derive the rotation\ncurves, fully keeping in mind the uncertainties due to\ninclination. To avoid our conclusions being skewed by\nthis galaxy, we will present our analysis both with and\nwithout Ho I.\nThe Hi velocity dispersions in Fig. A.9 show high\nvalues of \u223c12 km s\u22121 in the north western part (see\nalso Ott et al. 2001). Compared to the derived rotation velocity of \u223c20 km s\u22121 in the outer region, the\nmagnitude of this velocity dispersion is significant. We\ntherefore correct the rotation curve for asymmetric drift\nas described in Section 3.3. The corrected curve is\npresented in Fig. A.10. We adopt this corrected bulk\nrotation curve for the kinematic analysis of Ho I. We\nagain stress that in all further analysis we consider our\nresults with and without Ho I.\n\nall ring parameters are well determined and are consistent with the results by Bureau & Carignan (2002). The\n2nd moment map shows rather large velocity dispersions\ncompared to the circular rotation velocity. Therefore,\nwe make a correction for pressure support. The asymmetric drift corrected bulk rotation curve is presented in\nFig. A.14; it is rather flat and increases slightly beyond\n4 kpc, compared to the uncorrected one. In Fig. A.14,\nthe amplitudes of the harmonic terms derived from the\nhermite h3 velocity field are less than 5 km s\u22121 over most\nradii, although slightly larger than those from the bulk\nvelocity field.\nIn Fig. A.15, we compare our rotation curve with\nthat from the literature. The \u223c45\u2032\u2032 resolution IWM\nrotation curve by Bureau & Carignan (2002) not only\nfalls below the asymmetric drift corrected bulk rotation\ncurve but also below the THINGS IWM one, despite\nthe correction for asymmetric drift by the authors. The\ndifference between the respective tilted-ring models is\nnot enough to explain this velocity difference. It is likely\nthat the Bureau & Carignan's lower beam resolution\ndata (\u223c45\u2032\u2032 ) and the derived rotation curve with a larger\nring width (\u223c60\u2032\u2032 ) which smooth small-scale \"wiggles\"\ncaused by non-circular motions in the galaxy (e.g., at\n\u223c2 kpc) are the main explanation for the difference. In\nFig. A.15, we find that the THINGS IWM curve with a\nring width of 60\u2032\u2032 is slightly lower than the one with 12\u2032\u2032 .\nWe use the asymmetric drift corrected bulk rotation\ncurve for the mass modeling of Ho II.\n\n\u2022 Ho II: We derive the rotation curve using the bulk\nvelocity field shown in Fig. A.13. As shown in Fig. A.14,\n\n\u2022 DDO 53: As shown in Fig. A.17, DDO 53 shows a\nclear rotation pattern in its velocity field. However, the\ndistorted iso-velocity contours imply the presence of non-\n\n\fDark and luminous matter in THINGS dwarf galaxies\ncircular motions. In particular they are prominent in the\nouter regions as confirmed by the extracted NONC velocity field and the harmonic analysis as shown in Figs. A.17\nand A.18, respectively. To minimize the effect of these\nnon-circular motions, we extract the bulk velocity field\nas shown in Fig. A.17. Compared to other types of velocity fields, the bulk velocity field is noisier but the overall\nrotation pattern is better visible. In addition, as shown\nin Fig. A.18, the amplitudes of the harmonic terms decomposed from the bulk velocity field are close to zero in\ncomparison to those from the hermite h3 velocity field.\nThe derived rotation curves using the bulk velocity field\nare shown in Fig. A.18, and most ring parameters except\ninclination are well determined. The inclination shows\na large scatter as a function of radius, especially in the\ninner regions.\nWe examine the effect of inclination on the rotation\nvelocity by changing it by \u00b110 \u25e6 and performing tiltedring fits while keeping other ring parameters the same.\nAlthough the rotation curve derived using the lower inclination value (\u223c17 \u25e6 ) is higher by up to \u223c10 km s\u22121 ,\nthis low inclination value seems not plausible for DDO\n53. Like the case of Ho I, we show a fit result with only\nthe INCL free as indicated by gray dots in the INCL\npanel of Fig. A.18. They are larger than those (open circles) from the very first run with all ring parameters free.\nThe lower inclination value (\u223c17 \u25e6 ) can be regarded as a\nlower limit.\nThe maximum bulk rotation velocity is \u223c18 km s\u22121\nwhich is comparable to the values found for the velocity\ndispersion in the outer regions of the galaxy (see\nFig. A.17). This demands an asymmetric drift correction, and the corrected curve is shown in Fig. A.18. The\ncorrected curve keeps increasing to \u223c34 km s\u22121 at 2 kpc.\nWe use this rotation velocity for the mass modeling of\nDDO 53.\n\u2022 M81dwB: The extracted velocity fields themselves\nshow little difference with respect to each other as shown\nin Fig A.21. The NONC velocity field shows no significant non-circular motions in the galaxy, except in the\nvery outer regions. Moreover, as shown in Fig. A.22, the\namplitudes of the harmonic terms (corrected for inclination) decomposed from both the IWM and hermite h3\nvelocity fields are less than 5 km s\u22121 over most radii. In\naddition, the difference between the harmonic terms derived from the IWM and hermite h3 velocity fields is also\nnegligible. This implies that the effect of non-circular\nmotions on the velocity fields is not significant. Therefore, we can use the hermite h3 velocity field to derive\nthe rotation curve. As already discussed in Section 3.1,\nthe hermite h3 velocity field gives a robust estimate for\nthe underlying circular rotation of a galaxy in which noncircular motions are insignificant. In Fig. A.22, the derived hermite h3 rotation curve keeps increasing out to\n0.5 kpc and then stays flat to 1 kpc. Beyond that, the\ncurve rapidly declines but this is mainly due to the small\nnumber of pixels that contain signal and the large uncertainties in the velocities of the outer rings.\nThe large velocity dispersions (\u223c15 km s\u22121 ) in the\nouter regions are significant compared to the maximum\nrotation velocity of \u223c28 km s\u22121 . We therefore perform\nthe asymmetric drift correction for the circular rotation\nafter which the corrected curve keeps increasing out to\n\n7\n\n1 kpc as shown in Fig. A.22.\n\u2022 DDO 154: The complete description of the data\nand the mass modeling including the tilted-ring analysis\nis given in detail in de Blok et al. (2008). It shows a\nregular rotation pattern in the hermite h3 velocity field\nin Fig. A.25 (see also Fig. 81 in de Blok et al. 2008). In\naddition, no significant non-circular motions were found\nin the galaxy from a harmonic analysis of the velocity\nfield (Trachternach et al. 2008). We therefore use the\nhermite h3 rotation curve as in the case of M81dwB. As\ndescribed in de Blok et al. (2008), the resulting rotation\ncurve resembles that of a galaxy with solid-body rotation\nbut increases more steeply in the inner regions than\nprevious determinations (e.g., Carignan & Freeman\n1988; Carignan & Purton 1998) for which the IWM\nvelocity fields with lower beam resolutions were used. In\nthis paper, we use the hermite h3 rotation curve derived\nin de Blok et al. (2008) for the mass modeling of DDO\n154, and refer to their paper for a complete discussion.\nIn summary, the rotation velocities derived from the\nbulk velocity fields of the THINGS dwarf galaxies (except\nM81dwB and DDO 154 where a hermite h3 velocity field\nwas used) generally show the most rapid increase compared to those from the other types of velocity fields, such\nas the IWM, peak, single Gaussian fit and hermite h3 .\nThe IWM velocities show the slowest increase, especially\nin the inner region of the galaxy. The rotation velocities\nderived from the peak, single Gaussian fit and hermite\nh3 velocity fields show an increasingly steeper gradient\nthan the IWM velocity, but somewhat less steep than\nthe bulk velocity. This is due to their different abilities\nto take asymmetries of profiles affected by non-circular\nmotions into account. The IWM velocity field is the one\nmost affected by non-circular motions. The random noncircular motions induce a smaller velocity gradient across\nthe IWM velocity field, which results in a rotation velocity that increases more slowly. In contrast, the bulk velocity field minimizes the effect of random motions, and\nproperly extracts the underlying circular rotation.\nWe also examine the sensitivity of the rotation curves\nto the exact value of inclination. Of our galaxies, the\nrotation curves of Ho I and DDO 53 (whose inclination\nvalues are \u223c14 \u25e6 and \u223c27 \u25e6 , respectively) are most sensitive to changes in inclination. However, the adopted\ninclination values from the tilted-ring fits appear to be\nplausible. In addition, they also agree well with those\nderived independently from the Baryonic Tully\u2212Fisher\nrelation as will be discussed in Section 5.2 later.\n4. MASS MODELS OF BARYONS\n\nThe rotation curve reflects the dynamics of the total\nmatter content in a galaxy, including the baryons and\nthe dark matter. We therefore subtract the dynamical\ncontribution of baryons from the total dynamics to determine the dark matter component only. To this end,\nwe first derive radial distributions of the baryons in our\ngalaxies and derive mass models for them.\n4.1. Stellar component\nWe derive the mass models for the stellar components\nof our sample galaxies following the method described in\nOh et al. (2008; see also de Blok et al. 2008). Firstly, we\n\n\f8\n\nOh et al.\n\nderive the luminosity profiles of the galaxies by applying the tilted-ring models derived in Section 3.2 to the\nIRAC 3.6\u03bcm images from SINGS to derive radially averaged surface brightness profiles. These are shown in\nthe Appendix. We then convert the luminosity profiles\nto mass density profiles in units of M\u2299 pc\u22122 using an\nempirical \u03a5\u22c6 relation derived from population synthesis\nmodels, as described in Oh et al. (2008). The empirical\nrelation derives \u03a5\u22c6 in the IRAC 3.6\u03bcm band (\u03a53.6\n\u22c6 ) from\nthe \u03a5\u22c6 in K band (\u03a5K\n)\nwhich\nin\nturn\nis\ndetermined\nus\u22c6\ning optical colors and metallicity of a galaxy, as given in\nBell & de Jong (2001). The optical (B, V and R) surface\nbrightness profiles and colors (B \u2212 V and B \u2212 R) used for\ndetermining \u03a5K\n\u22c6 are shown in the Appendix. Here, we\nuse constant average colors for our galaxies, except for\nIC 2574 where the radial distribution of colors can be derived. We also show the metallicity of the sample galaxies\nin Table 1. From this we compute \u03a53.6\nfor the sample\n\u22c6\ngalaxies, as shown in the Appendix. Leroy et al. (2008)\nuse an empirical K-to-3.6\u03bcm calibration to derive Kband fluxes from the IRAC 3.6\u03bcm images for a number\nof THINGS galaxies. They then derive the stellar disk\nmasses adopting a fixed \u03a5K\n\u22c6 =0.5. de Blok et al. (2008)\nmake a comparison between the stellar disk masses derived using our method and the approach by Leroy et al.\n(2008), and find that they agree well with each other.\nUsing the \u03a53.6\n\u22c6 values, we derive the mass density profiles of stellar components of the sample galaxies (presented in the Appendix). We then calculate the rotation velocities for the stellar components from the mass\ndensity profiles, assuming a vertical sech2 (z) scale height\ndistribution. We use h/z0 =5, the ratio between the vertical scale height z0 and the radial scale length h of disk,\nas determined in van der Kruit & Searle (1981; see also\nKregel et al. 2002). The derived z0 values are given in\nTable 1. The average value is z0 \u2243 0.32 kpc. We construct the final mass models for the stellar components\nof the sample galaxies using the rotmod task in GIPSY,\nthe results of which are shown in the Appendix.\n4.2. Gas component\n\nThe Hi surface density profile in M\u2299 pc\u22122 units can be\ndirectly derived from the observed Hi column density. In\norder to calculate the radial Hi distribution of the sample\ngalaxies, we apply the tilted-ring models derived in Section 3.2 to the integrated Hi maps to derive azimuthally\naveraged radial Hi profiles. We scale the derived Hi surface density profile by a factor of 1.4 (de Blok et al. 2008)\nto account for helium and metals and calculate the rotation velocities for the gas component. For this we assume\nan infinitely thin disk and use the task rotmod implemented in GIPSY. The gas surface density profiles and\nthe gas rotation velocities of our galaxies are presented\nin the Appendix.\n5. DARK MATTER HALO AND LUMINOUS MATTER\n\nIn general, dwarf galaxies are dark matter-dominated\nthroughout due to the small contribution of baryons\nto the total dynamics, as is the case in LSB galaxies (e.g., de Blok & McGaugh 1997; Prada & Burkert\n2002). Therefore, dwarf galaxies have been considered\nto be ideal objects for studying dark matter properties\nin galaxies. Of particular interest is testing the dark\n\nFig. 3.- The dark matter fraction \u03b3dm (as described in Eq. 6)\nof the 7 THINGS dwarf galaxies. Most galaxies are dark matter\ndominated across all radii except the inner region of DDO 53 and\nthe outer region of Ho II, respectively. This is discussed in detail\nin Section 5.1\n\nmatter distribution as predicted from cosmological simulations. In this section, we calculate the dark matter\nfraction of our galaxies and verify if dark matter indeed\ndominates the total dynamics of these systems. Furthermore, we also examine the relationship between the\ndark matter fraction and other galaxy properties, such as\nthe dynamical mass, the absolute B magnitude and the\nBaryonic Tully\u2212Fisher (BTF) relation (Bell & de Jong\n2001; Verheijen 2001; McGaugh 2004; De Rijcke & et al.\n2007).\n5.1. Dark matter fraction and galaxy properties\n\nWe derive the radial dark matter fraction of our galaxies using,\n\u03b3dm =\n\n2\n2\n2\nVtot\n\u2212 Vstar\n\u2212 Vgas\nMDM\n=\n,\n2\nMtot\nVtot\n\n(6)\n\nwhere Vtot is the observed total rotation velocity, and\nVstar and Vgas are the rotation velocities of stars and gas,\nrespectively. For this measurement, we use Vtot , Vstar\nand Vgas of our galaxies as derived in Sections 3.4 and 4\n(see the Appendix).\nIn Fig. 3, we plot \u03b3dm as a function of radius. The\nradii are normalized to the maximum radius (Rmax ) at\nwhich the last data point is measured. Most of our galaxies show large values of \u03b3dm of about 0.7 over the radial\nrange. This implies that they are indeed dark matterdominated over most of their radial range. Ho II and\nDDO 53 show radial gradients. The value of \u03b3dm for Ho\nII is \u223c0.7 within 0.4Rmax , but decreases to \u223c0.3 in the\nouter parts. The \u03b3dm value of DDO 53 is \u223c0.3 in the inner parts (<0.4Rmax ), but increases to \u223c0.7 in the outer\nparts. Note that the contribution of the gas component\nto the total dynamics is larger than that of stars in the\nouter parts of Ho II and the inner parts of DDO 53.\nWe proceed by examining the relationship between the\ndark matter fraction, the absolute B magnitude and the\n\n\fDark and luminous matter in THINGS dwarf galaxies\n\n9\n\nFig. 4.- Left: The relationship between the dark matter fraction and the absolute B magnitude of 19 THINGS dwarf and spiral\ngalaxies. <\u03b3dm > is determined by radially averaging \u03b3dm values of each galaxy. For the spiral galaxies, <\u03b3dm > values are calculated over\nthree regions, splitting a galaxy into three annuli (inner, middle and outer) as indicated by different symbols. Right: The relationship\nbetween the mean dark matter fraction <\u03b3dm > and the dynamical mass of the same galaxies. See Section 5.1 for more discussions.\n\ndynamical mass of 12 spiral galaxies from THINGS and\nthe 7 dwarf galaxies from the current sample. In the left\npanel of Fig. 4, we plot the radial average of \u03b3dm against\nthe absolute B magnitude of individual galaxies. For\nthe spiral galaxies where the inner and outer regions are\ntotally dominated by baryons and dark matter, respectively, we calculate average \u03b3dm values over three regions,\nsplitting a galaxy into three annuli (inner, middle and\nouter). For this, we choose an inner radius at which the\nrotation curve reaches its flat part, and split the region\nbeyond it into two equal-size radial bins for the middle\nand outer annuli. The calculated \u03b3dm values within the\nannuli for each spiral galaxy are indicated by different\nsymbols in Fig. 4. As expected, the outer region of the\nspiral galaxies is more dark matter dominated than the\ninner region. In addition it is likely that the dark matter fraction in the outer region of the spiral galaxies is\nsimilar to that of the dwarf galaxies.\nIn the right panel of Fig. 4, we show the relationship between the dark matter fraction and the dynamical mass of the galaxies. Likewise, for the spiral galaxies\nwe calculate average \u03b3dm values over three regions, splitting a galaxy into three annuli (inner, middle and outer).\nConsidering that more luminous galaxies are in general\nmore massive (e.g., Guo et al. 2010; Dutton et al. 2010),\nthis is largely consistent with the relationship between\n\u03b3dm and absolute B magnitude, as shown above.\n5.2. The baryonic Tully\u2212Fisher relation\nWe also examine whether the THINGS dwarf sample\ngalaxies follow the Baryonic Tully\u2212Fisher (BTF) relation. There have been several efforts to calibrate the\nBTF relation using a sample of gas dominated low mass\nsystems (McGaugh et al. 2000; McGaugh et al. 2005;\nStark et al. 2009). These found that the broken conti-\n\nnuity of the classical Tully\u2212Fisher relation of low-mass\ngalaxies can be restored by using their total baryonic\nmass (i.e., including not only stars but also the gas\ncomponent). As shown in Fig. 5, we plot the baryonic\n(stars + gas) mass of our galaxies derived in Section 4\nagainst the maximum rotation velocity at the last measured point. They are roughly consistent with the BTF\nrelation (indicated as the dashed line) from Stark et al.\n(2009) within the uncertainty but systematically slightly\nhigher than the line except M81dwB. This could be owing to the underestimated maximum rotation velocities of\nthe galaxies. Some of the rotation curves derived in Section 3.4 still keep increasing at the last measured point,\nwhich implies a larger maximum rotation velocity.\nAs already discussed in Section 3.4, the rotation curves\nof some of our sample galaxies are sensitive to the exact\nvalue of inclination (e.g., Ho I and DDO 53). As a sanity\ncheck, we therefore derive inclinations based on the BTF\nrelation. The observed line-of-sight velocity of a galaxy\nat the last measured point Rmax can be expressed by\nthe following equation (if we only consider the azimuthal\nvelocity component),\nTR\nVobs (Rmax ) = Vsys + Vmax\n\u00d7 sin iTR \u00d7 cos \u03b8,\n\n(7)\n\nwhere Vsys is the systemic velocity, \u03b8 is the position angle,\nTR\niTR is the inclination and Vmax\nis the maximum rotation\nvelocity derived from tilted-ring analysis. The BTF relation yields an estimate of maximum rotation velocity\nTR\nBTF\nVmax\nat a given baryonic mass. Therefore, in Eq. 7 Vmax\nBTF\ncan be substituted with Vmax and the corresponding inclination value iBTF which gives the same Vobs (Rmax ) can\nbe calculated using the following formula,\n\u0013\n\u0012 TR\nVmax\nTR\n.\n(8)\n\u00d7\nsin\ni\niBTF = arcsin\nBTF\nVmax\n\n\f10\n\nOh et al.\nwhere the mass density contrast exceeds 200 and x is\ndefined as R/R200 .\nIn addition, we also use an observationally motivated\npseudo-isothermal halo model as an extreme representation of \"core-like\" halo models (e.g., Begeman et al.\n1991). It has the following form,\n\u03c10\n\u03c1ISO (R) =\n,\n(11)\n1 + (R/RC )2\nwhere \u03c10 and RC are the core-density and core-radius of\nthe halo, respectively. This gives rise to a mass distribution with a sizable constant density-core (\u03c1 \u223c R0 ) at the\ncenters of galaxies. The rotation velocity induced by the\nmass distribution is given as,\nv\n\"\n!#\nu\nu\nR\nR\nC\n2 1\u2212\nVISO (R) = t4\u03c0G\u03c10 RC\n. (12)\natan\nR\nRC\n\nUsing these two halo models, we examine which model\nis preferable to describe the observed dark matter distribution of our galaxies.\nFig. 5.- The baryonic Tully\u2212Fisher relation of the THINGS\ndwarf galaxies. The baryonic mass includes the stellar and gas\ncomponents derived in Section 4. The long dashed-line indicates\nthe BTF relation calibrated using a sample of gas dominated galaxies in Stark et al. (2009), and the short dashed-lines indicate the\nuncertainty in the relation. See Section 5.2 for more details.\n\nThe derived iBTF values of the THINGS dwarf galaxies sample are given in Table 1, and they are smaller\nthan those derived from tilted-ring analysis except for\nBTF\nM81dwB. This is because the inferred Vmax\nvalues of\nTR\nour galaxies are larger than the Vmax values as shown\nin Fig. 5. Given the uncertainties in the estimates, the\ninclination values derived from both the BTF relation\nand the tilted-ring analysis are not significantly different from each other except for Ho II. However, as can\nbe seen from not only the tilted-ring analysis (including\nthe position-velocity diagram) but also the comparison\nof rotation velocities in the Appendix it is unlikely that\nHo II has an inclination (\u223c 25\u25e6 ) as low as that inferred\nfrom the BTF relation.\n6. DARK MATTER DISTRIBUTION\n\nIn this section, we compare the derived dark matter\ndistribution of the THINGS dwarf galaxies with that\ninferred from structure formation N-body simulations\nbased on the \u039bCDM paradigm. For this we use an NFW\nhalo model (Navarro et al. 1996, 1997) which is given as,\n\u03c1i\n,\n(9)\n\u03c1NFW (R) =\n(R/Rs )(1 + R/Rs )2\nwhere \u03c1i is the initial density of the Universe at the time\nof the collapse of the halo and Rs is the characteristic radius of the dark matter halo. This gives a \"cusp\" feature\nhaving a power law mass density distribution \u03c1 \u223c R\u22121\ntowards the centers of galaxies. The corresponding rotation velocity induced by this potential has the following\nform,\ns\nln(1 + cx) \u2212 cx/(1 + cx)\nVNFW (R) = V200\n,\n(10)\nx[ln(1 + c) \u2212 c/(1 + c)]\nwhere c is the concentration parameter defined as\nR200 /Rs . V200 is the rotation velocity at radius R200\n\n6.1. Dark matter mass modeling\n\nWe subtract the dynamical contribution of the baryons\nfrom the total kinematics and construct mass models of\nthe dark matter halos of our galaxies. We fit the two halo\nmodels, i.e., the NFW and pseudo-isothermal models (see\ne.g. Oh et al. 2008), to the bulk rotation curves derived\nin Section 3, taking into account the mass models of the\nbaryons. When performing the fits, we use various assumptions for \u03a5\u22c6 , such as \"maximum disk\", \"minimum\ndisk\" and \"minimum+gas disk\" as well as the model \u03a53.6\n\u22c6\nvalue as described in Section 4.1. The maximum disk\nassumes that the observed rotation curve in the inner\nregions of a galaxy is almost entirely due to the stellar component (van Albada & Sancisi 1986). Therefore,\nthe dark matter properties derived using this assumption\nwill provide a lower limit to its mass distribution. In\ncontrast, the minimum disk hypothesis ignores the contribution of baryons and attributes the rotation curve to\nthe dark matter component only (van Albada & Sancisi\n1986). This yields a robust upper limit on the properties of dark matter. The minimum+gas disk ignores the\nstellar component but includes the gas component.\nThe fit results of individual galaxies are presented in\nthe figures (\"Mass modeling results\") and Tables in the\nAppendix. We find that in terms of fit-quality (i.e., \u03c72red )\npseudo-isothermal halo models are mostly preferred over\nNFW halo models in describing the dark matter distribution of our galaxies. In addition the mean value of\nthe logarithmic central halo surface density log(\u03c10 RC ) in\nunits of M\u2299 pc\u22122 of our sample galaxies is \u223c 1.62 \u00b1 0.14.\nThis is smaller than the relation (log \u03c10 R0 = 2.15 \u00b1 0.2)\nfound by Donato et al. (2009) from a sample of galaxies. However, considering that the relation found by\nDonato et al. (2009) was derived assuming the Burkert\nprofile (Burkert 1995), they are not significantly different\nfrom each other.\nIn most galaxies, the NFW halo model fails to fit\nthe rotation curves, irrespective of the assumptions of\n\u03a5\u22c6 (i.e., maximum, minimum, minimum+gas and model\n\u03a53.6\ndisk), giving negative (or close to zero) c val\u22c6\nues. Even if the fits are feasible (e.g., Ho II), pseudo-\n\n\fDark and luminous matter in THINGS dwarf galaxies\nFig. 6.- Left: The shape of the total rotation curves (not corrected for baryons) of the 7 THINGS dwarf galaxies. The rotation curves are scaled with respect to the rotation velocity\nV0.3 at R0.3 where the logarithmic slope of the curve is dlogV /dlogR = 0.3 (Hayashi & Navarro 2006). We overplot the rotation curves of the NFW models with V200 ranging from 10 to\n110 km s\u22121 . The dotted lines indicate the NFW models with V200 less than 110 km s\u22121 . The scaled rotation curves of the best fit pseudo-isothermal halo models (denoted as ISO) are\nalso overplotted. See Section 6.2 for more details. Right: The shape of the dark matter rotation curves of the 7 THINGS dwarf galaxies. These are corrected for baryons and are scaled\nwith respect to the rotation velocity V0.3 at R0.3 . Same legends as in the left panel. Compared to the total rotation curves in the left panel, the dark matter rotation curves increase less\nsteeply but they are similar due to the low baryonic fraction of the galaxies as discussed in Section 5.1. See Section 6.2 for more discussions.\n\n11\n\n\f12\n\nOh et al.\n\nFig. 7.- The dark matter density profiles of the 7 THINGS dwarf galaxies. The profiles are derived using the scaled rotation curves\n(assuming minimum disk) as described in Section 6.2 (see also Fig. 6). The dotted lines represent the mass density profiles of NFW models\n(\u03b1 \u223c\u22121.0) with V200 ranging from 10 to 110 km s\u22121 . The dashed lines indicate the mass density profiles of the best fit pseudo-isothermal\nhalo models (\u03b1 \u223c 0.0). See Section 6.3 for more details.\n\n\fDark and luminous matter in THINGS dwarf galaxies\nisothermal halo models are still slightly better in describing the rotation curves irrespective of the all assumptions on \u03a5\u22c6 . We also fit the NFW model to the\nrotation curves with only V200 as a free parameter after\nfixing c to 9 which is similar to typical values (e.g., 8\u201310;\nMcGaugh et al. 2003) predicted from \u039bCDM cosmology.\nHowever, as shown in the Tables in the Appendix, the\nbest-fit \u03c72red values are even larger than those from the\nfits with both c and V200 as free parameters. Moreover, at\nthe inner regions of the rotation curves, the fitted NFW\nhalo models are too steep. This will be further discussed\nin the following section.\nIt is also interesting how well the \"minimum disk\" assumption on \u03a5\u22c6 provides a good description of the baryonic mass distributions of the galaxies. As shown in\nthe Appendix, the best-fit \u03c72red values are close to the\nones obtained assuming the model \u03a53.6\n\u22c6 . This confirms\nthat the THINGS dwarf galaxies are indeed dark-matterdominated.\n6.2. Rotation curve shape\n\nThe divergent density profiles (e.g., \u223cR\u03b1 where\n\u03b1\u223c\u22120.8 at 120 pc; Stadel et al. 2009; see also\nGraham et al. 2006) found in \u039bCDM simulations are expected towards the centers of galaxies and thus ought to\nbe observed (see also Navarro et al. 2010). Dark matter slopes at smaller radius are often steeper although\nrecent simulations for dwarf galaxies that include the detailed description and effect of baryonic feedback processes show shallower slopes (Governato et al. 2010). A\ncomparison of these simulations with THINGS dwarf\ngalaxies will be discussed in a separate paper (Oh et al.).\nThe cusp-like dark matter distribution in turn forces\na unique shape to the rotation curve. Therefore, a comparison of the shape of the rotation curves between observation and simulations provides an additional test of\n\u039bCDM cosmology. Moreover, the low baryon fraction\nof our galaxies, as found in Section 5.1, allows us to directly compare the rotation curve shapes with those of\n\u039bCDM simulations even if they are partially affected by\nthe baryons.\nFor this comparison, we model CDM halos covering a\nwide range of V200 from 10 to 110 km s\u22121 . The concentration parameter c corresponding to a particular value of\nV200 is determined by the following empirical c \u2212 V200 relation from the WMAP5 observations in McGaugh et al.\n(2007; see also de Blok et al. 2003),\nh\nlog V200 = 2C \u2212 log[g(c)] \u2212 log( ),\n2\nwhere\ng(c) =\n\nc2\n,\nln(1 + c) \u2212 c/(1 + c)\n\n(13)\n\n(14)\n\nh = H0 /100km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 and C = 1.61 for the 3 year\nWMAP parameters (Spergel et al. 2007). We adopt h =\n0.75. We refer the reader to McGaugh et al. (2007) for\nmore details.\nTo be able to compare any discrepancies in shape, we\nscale both the rotation curves of our galaxies and those\nof the adopted CDM halos to the velocity V0.3 at the\n5 The Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (Spergel et al.\n2003; Spergel et al. 2007)\n\n13\n\nradius R0.3 , where R0.3 is the radius where the logarithmic slope of the curve is dlogV /dlogR=0.3. As discussed in Hayashi & Navarro (2006), the NFW curves are\nwell resolved at the scaling radius R0.3 (corresponding\nto \u223c0.4Rs where Rs is given in Eq. 9) as their asymptotic slopes are about dlogV /dlogR=0.5. In addition,\nthis scaling radius is also well determined in observed\nrotation curves since it lies between the inner linear\n(dlogV /dlogR=1) and the outer flat (dlogV /dlogR=0)\nregions of the rotation curves of most disk galaxies\n(Hayashi & Navarro 2006). This also holds for our sample galaxies, except for IC 2574 where the outermost logarithmic slope is still larger than 0.3. In the case of IC\n2574, we scale the rotation curve to the maximum radius Rmax where the last data point is measured, and\ncorresponding maximum rotation velocity.\nWe plot the scaled rotation curves in the left panel\nof Fig. 6. These rotation curves are not corrected for\nbaryons, and assume the minimum disk model as described in Section 6.1. Similarly, in the right panel of\nFig. 6, we plot the scaled rotation curves corrected for\nbaryons derived from Section 4. Although the rotation\ncurves corrected for baryons increase less steeply than\nthe curves assuming a minimum disk, they are very similar. This directly shows that using the minimum disk\nassumption gives a good description of the dark matter distribution in our galaxies. In Fig. 6, the CDM rotation curves with V200 less than 110 km s\u22121 are represented by dotted lines. Of our sample galaxies, IC\n2574 has the largest maximum rotation velocity of about\n80 km s\u22121 . Therefore, the CDM rotation curve with\nV200 =110 km s\u22121 is a hard upper limit for our galaxies\nassuming that Vmax \u223c V200 . We also overplot the best\nfits of pseudo-isothermal models (dashed lines) derived\nusing the minimum disk assumption and derived \u03a53.6\n\u22c6 in\nFig. 6.\nAs can be seen in Fig. 6, the rotation curve shapes\nof the galaxies are similar and consistent with those of\npseudo-isothermal halo models. However, they are inconsistent with those of \u039bCDM simulations. The rotation curves of \u039bCDM simulations rise too steeply to\nmatch the observations. The difference in rotation curve\nshapes between our galaxies and \u039bCDM simulations is\nparticularly prominent in the inner regions of galaxies\ni.e., at radii less than R0.3 . This difference is further enhanced for the CDM rotation curves with V200 less than\n110 km s\u22121 . In conclusion, the solid body-like rotation\ncurves of our galaxies rise too slowly to reflect the cusplike dark matter distribution in CDM halos.\n6.3. Dark matter density profile\n\nDirect conversion of the galaxy rotation curve to the\nmass density profile allows us to examine the radial matter distribution in the galaxy. In particular, the measured inner slope of the density profile is critical for\nresolving the \"cusp/core\" problem at the galaxy center. The Poisson equation (\u22072 \u03a6 = 4\u03c0G\u03c1, where \u03a6 =\n\u2212GM/R) can be used for the conversion under the assumption of a spherical mass distribution. The mass density \u03c1 is directly derived from the rotation curve V (R),\nas follows (see de Blok et al. 2001 for more details),\n\"\n!2 #\nV \u2202V\nV\n1\n2\n.\n(15)\n+\n\u03c1(R) =\n4\u03c0G R \u2202R\nR\n\n\f14\n\nOh et al.\n\nFig. 8.- The inner slope of the dark matter density profile plotted against the radius of the innermost point. The inner density\nslope \u03b1 is measured by a least squares fit to the inner data point as\ndescribed in the small figure. The inner-slopes of the mass density\nprofiles of the 7 THINGS dwarf galaxies are overplotted with earlier\npapers and they are consistent with previous measurements of LSB\ngalaxies. The pseudo-isothermal model is preferred over the NFW\nmodel to explain the observational data. Gray symbols: open circles (de Blok et al. 2001); triangles (de Blok & Bosma 2002); open\nstars (Swaters et al. 2003). See Section 6.3 for more discussions.\n\nUsing Eq. 15, we directly convert the total rotation\ncurves into mass density profiles. Here, we use the minimum disk hypothesis (i.e., ignores baryons). As already\ndiscussed in Section 5.1, our galaxies are mostly dark\nmatter-dominated and this \"minimum disk\" assumption\nis a good approximation in describing their dynamics.\nParticularly useful is the fact that it gives a hard upper\nlimit to the dark matter density.\nIn this way, we derive the mass density profiles of the\n7 THINGS dwarf galaxies and present them in the Appendix. We also derive the mass density profiles using\nthe scaled rotation curves derived assuming minimum\ndisk in Fig. 6, and plot them in Fig. 7. The best fits of\nthe NFW and pseudo-isothermal models are also overplotted. Despite the scatter, the derived mass density\nprofiles are more consistent with the pseudo-isothermal\nmodels as shown in Fig. 7.\nTo quantify the degree of concentration of the dark\nmatter distribution towards the galaxy center, we measure the logarithmic inner slope of the density profile.\nFor this measurement, we first need to determine a\nbreak-radius where the slope changes most rapidly. The\ninner density slope is then measured by performing a\nleast squares fit to the data points within the breakradius. For the uncertainty, we re-measure the slope\ntwice, including the first data point outside the breakradius and excluding the data point at the break radius.\nThe mean difference between these two slopes is adopted\nas the slope uncertainty \u2206\u03b1. The measured slope \u03b1\nand slope uncertainty \u2206\u03b1 of the galaxies are shown in\nthe Appendix. In addition, we overplot the mass density profiles of NFW and pseudo-isothermal halo mod-\n\nels which are best fitted to the rotation curves of the\ngalaxies. From this, we find that the mean value of the\ninner density slopes for the galaxies is \u03b1=\u22120.29 \u00b1 0.07\n(and \u22120.27 \u00b1 0.07 without Ho I which has a low inclination. See Section 3.4 for details). These rather flat\nslopes are in very good agreement with the value of\n\u03b1 = \u22120.2 \u00b1 0.2 found in the earlier work of de Blok et al.\n(2001; see also de Blok & Bosma 2002) for a larger number of LSB galaxies. They are, however, in contrast with\nthe steep slope of \u223c\u22120.8 predicted by \u039bCDM simulations\n(e.g., Stadel et al. 2009; Navarro et al. 2010) as well as\nthose by the classical simulations (e.g., Navarro, Frenk &\nWhite 1996, 1997). This implies that the sample galaxies\nshow slightly increasing or even constant density profiles\ntowards their centers.\nWe also examine how the mass model differs when it\nis based on the hermite h3 rotation curve instead of the\nbulk one. For this, we use IC 2574 which shows strong\nnon-circular motions close to the center. As shown in the\n\"Mass density profile\" panel of Fig. A.3, the mass density profile derived using the hermite h3 rotation curve\nis found to be slightly lower than that from the bulk rotation curve at the central regions. This is mainly due\nto the lower hermite h3 rotation velocity, resulting in\nsmaller velocity gradients \u2202V /\u2202R in Eq. 15 and thus\nsmaller densities. The measured inner density slope is\n\u03b1=0.00 \u00b1 0.19 which is similar, within the error, to that\n(\u03b1=0.13 \u00b1 0.07) based on the bulk rotation curve. This\nsupports earlier studies that suggest that the effect of\nsystematic non-circular motions in dwarf galaxies is not\nenough to hide the central cusps (e.g., Gentile et al. 2004;\nTrachternach et al. 2008; van Eymeren et al. 2009).\nIn Fig. 8, we plot the logarithmic inner density slope\n\u03b1 against resolution of a rotation curve. At high resolutions (Rin < 1 kpc) the slopes of the NFW and pseudoisothermal halo models can be clearly distinguished but\nat low resolutions (Rin \u223c1 kpc) the slopes of the two\nmodels are approximately equal (de Blok et al. 2001).\nBecause of their proximity (\u223c4 Mpc) and their highlyresolved rotation curves, the innermost radius of the rotation curves that can be probed for our galaxies is about\n0.1-0.2 kpc. We also overplot the theoretical \u03b1\u2212Rin relations of NFW and pseudo-isothermal halo models as solid\nand dotted lines, respectively. The highly-resolved rotation curves of our galaxies (i.e., Rin \u223c0.2 kpc) deviate\nsignificantly from the prediction of NFW CDM models.\nIn particular, around Rin \u223c0.1 kpc where the predictions\nof the two halo models are clearly distinct, the \u03b1 \u2212 Rin\ntrend of our galaxies is more consistent with those of\npseudo-isothermal halo models.\n7. CONCLUSIONS\n\nIn this paper we have presented high-resolution mass\nmodels of the 7 dwarf galaxies, IC 2574, NGC 2366,\nHo I, Ho II, DDO 53, DDO 154 and M81dwB from the\nTHINGS survey, and examined their dark matter distribution by comparison with classical \u039bCDM simulations.\nThe THINGS high-resolution data significantly reduce\nobservational systematic effects, such as beam smearing, center offset and non-circular motions. When deriving the rotation curves, we used various types of velocity fields, such as intensity-weighted mean, peak, single\nGaussian, hermite h3 and bulk velocity fields, and compared the results. In particular the bulk velocity field\n\n\fDark and luminous matter in THINGS dwarf galaxies\nwas able to efficiently remove small-scale random motions and allowed us to better determine the total kinematics of the galaxies.\nWe also found that the relation between the total baryonic mass (stars + gas) and the maximum rotation velocity of the galaxies is roughly consistent with the Baryonic\nTully\u2212Fisher (BTF) relation calibrated from a larger\nsample of low mass galaxies. Especially, the inclination\nvalues derived if one takes the BTF relation at face value\nare not significantly different from those derived from a\ntilted-ring analysis. This implies that the BTF relation\ncan be used as an alternative way for deriving inclinations\nof galaxies for which it is difficult to apply a tilted-ring\nanalysis.\nWe derived the mass models of baryons, and subtracted\nthem from the total kinematics. For the stellar component, we used SINGS 3.6\u03bcm and optical data determined\nby the stellar mass\u2013to\u2013light ratio \u03a5\u22c6 for the 3.6\u03bcm band.\nFor the purpose of our study we use the 3.6\u03bcm Spitzer\nimages to estimate the mass of the old stellar population in our target galaxies. Even though this band may\ncontain some dust emission features, we consider it to\nbe the best consistent tracer of the stellar masses (see\ndiscussion in Leroy et al. 2008, de Blok et al. 2008 and\nOh et al. 2008). These therefore allow us to estimate\nthe old stellar population that dominates the stellar continuum emission in the infrared regime. Although our\nsample dwarf galaxies are dark matter dominated as indicated by their low baryonic fraction, the population\nsynthesis \u03a53.6\nvalues gave slightly better or similar fits\n\u22c6\nthan not only the maximum disk but also the minimum\n(+gas) disk assumptions in describing the stellar component.\nWith the help of the well determined total kinematics and the mass models of baryons, we were able to\naccurately constrain the dark matter distribution in the\ngalaxies. From this, we found a significant discrepancy\nin the dark matter distribution between the THINGS\ndwarf galaxies and classical dark-matter-only cosmological simulations both in the rotation curve shape and the\ninner slope \u03b1 of the mass density profiles. The rotation\ncurves of the galaxies rise less steeply to be consistent\nwith the cusp feature at the centers. In addition the\nmean value of the inner slopes of the mass density profiles is \u03b1=\u22120.29 \u00b1 0.07 (and \u22120.27 \u00b1 0.07 without Ho I\nwhich has a low inclination), significantly deviating from\n\n15\n\n\u223c\u22121 inferred from dark-matter-only simulations. Considering the fact that the bulk rotation curves which show\nthe most rapid increase compared to the others (particularly in the inner regions) were used, the results provide\ngood evidence that the central dark matter distribution\nin dwarf galaxies is not cusp-like, as suggested by earlier\nstudies.\nIt is most likely that both the lack of resolution and\nthe absence of baryonic physics in the older simulations\nplay the dominant role for the discrepancy. In order to\ndistinguish the core and cusp-like models clearly, it is indispensable for the simulations to resolve scales smaller\nthan 1 kpc (de Blok et al. 2008). In addition baryons\nare dynamically important in the central regions and\ntheir feedback like gas outflows driven by star formation or supernovae may affect the dark matter distribution indirectly through gravitational interaction on\ngalaxy scales. Therefore improvements on both resolution and description of baryonic feedback processes in\nsimulations will provide a major contribution toward\na solution for the \"cusp/core\" problem. We refer a\ncompanion paper (Oh et al. 2011) where we compare\nthe results from the latest high-resolution cosmological\nN \u2212 body + Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamic (SPH)\nsimulations by Governato et al. (2010), of dwarf galaxies\nthat include effects of baryonic feedback processes which\nresult in shallower slopes of \u03b1.\n\nSHOH acknowledges financial support from the South\nAfrican Square Kilometre Array Project.

DATA AND KINEMATIC ANALYSIS\n\nIn the following we present the data and kinematic analysis of 7 dwarf galaxies from \"The Hi Nearby Galaxy Survey\n(THINGS)\". The kinematic analysis includes (1) the tilted ring model, (2) the harmonic analysis, (3) the mass models\nof baryons and dark matter and (4) the dark matter density profile. The following are general descriptions of the figures.\n\u2022 Data\u2212 We show the total intensity maps in Spitzer IRAC 3.6\u03bcm, optical B, R-bands and Hi 21 cm. The latter\ncan be used to directly derive the Hi surface density. The stellar surface density is based on the Spitzer 3.6\u03bcm map\nand information about the optical colors (see main text for details). The 2nd moment map showing the velocity\ndispersions of the Hi profiles is also given. We then compare the five types of velocity fields extracted from the Hi data\ncube: The intensity-weighted mean (IWM), the Peak-intensity (PEAK), the Single Gaussian profile (SGFIT), the\nhermite h3 (HER3) and the bulk velocity fields (BULK). Additionally, we show the extracted velocity field of strong\nnon-circular motions (NONC). We also show a major-axis position-velocity (P-V) diagram overlayed with the derived\nbulk rotation curve corrected for inclination. For the extraction of the integrated Hi map, the intensity-weighted\nmean velocity field, and the 2nd moment map, the natural-weighted data cube is used. See Walter et al. (2008) for a\ndetailed description of the data cubes.\n\u2022 Rotation curves\u2212 The tilted ring model derived from the bulk (or hermite h3 for M81dwB) velocity field. Note\nthat the black solid lines are not the fits to the gray open circles. The open gray circles indicate the fit made with all\nring parameters \"free\". The final rotation curves (black solid lines) are derived after several iterations.\n\u2022 Asymmetric drift correction\u2212 For galaxies where the velocity dispersion is comparable to the maximum\nrotation velocity, we correct for the asymmetric drift following the method described in Bureau & Carignan (2002).\nSee Section 3.3 for a detailed description.\n\u2022 Harmonic analysis\u2212 Harmonic expansion of the hermite h3 and bulk velocity fields. Gray circles and black\ndots represent the results from the hermite h3 and the bulk velocity fields, respectively. c0 and c1 are the systemic\nand the rotation velocities. c2 , c3 , s1 , s2 , and s3 components quantify non-circular motion components. In the\nbottom-rightmost panel, we show a global elongation of the potential, \u01ebpot sin 2\u03c62 calculated at each radius as\ndescribed in Schoenmakers et al. (1997) and Schoenmakers (1999). This measurement can be used as an additional\ntest for CDM halos (e.g., Trachternach et al. 2008). The black solid and gray dashed lines indicate the average values\nof the potential derived using the bulk and hermite h3 velocity fields, respectively.\n\u2022 Mass models of baryons\u2212 (a): Azimuthally averaged surface brightness profiles in the 3.6\u03bcm, R, V , and B\nbands (top to bottom) derived assuming the tilted-ring parameters derived as above. These are not corrected for\ninclination except for the 3.6\u03bcm. The lines shown are fits to the data which are partly filled. (b)(f ): Derived values\nof \u03a5\u22c6 in the K and 3.6\u03bcm bands from Bruzual & Charlot (2003) population synthesis models. The dotted and dashed\nlines are computed using optical colors (B \u2212 R and B \u2212 V ) in (e) and the mean value (solid line) is adopted as the\nfinal \u03a5\u22c6 . The relationships between \u03a5K\n\u22c6 and optical colors (e.g., B \u2212 R, B \u2212 V ) are adopted from the models of\n3.6\nBell & de Jong (2001). For the conversion of \u03a5K\n\u22c6 to \u03a5\u22c6 , Eq. 6 in Oh et al. (2008) is used. (e): The optical colors\n(B \u2212 R and B \u2212 V ) derived from the surface brightness profiles in (a). Where B \u2212 R was not available, only B \u2212 V\nis given. (c)(d): Mass models for the stellar component. The stellar mass surface density is derived from the 3.6\u03bcm\nsurface brightness (inclination corrected) in (a) using the \u03a53.6\n\u22c6 values shown in (f ). The resulting expected rotation\nvelocity for Hi if it were to move in circular orbits in the potential corresponding to the optical mass density only is\nthen derived from this. (g)(h): The mass model for the gas component. The radial mass surface density distribution\nof neutral gas is scaled by 1.4 to account for He and metals.\n\u2022 Comparison of rotation curves\u2212 Comparison of the rotation velocity derived from the bulk velocity field with\nthose from the other types of velocity fields (i.e., IWM, hermite h3 , single Gaussian fit and peak velocity fields) and\nthe literature in case other measurements are available. For the bulk rotation velocity, we derive rotation velocities for\nreceding and approaching side only, by keeping the ring parameters the same. These are indicated as the gray (inverse)\ntriangles. We also show the bulk rotation velocity corrected with iBTF derived from the Baryonic Tully\u2212Fisher (BTF)\nrelation.\n\u2022 Mass density profile\u2212 The derived mass density profile. The dashed and solid lines show the best fits of the\nNFW halo model and the pseudo-isothermal halo model to the rotation curve, respectively. The measured inner slope\n\u03b1 is shown in the panel.\n\u2022 Mass modeling results\u2212 Disk-halo decomposition of the bulk rotation curve (asymmetric drift corrected where\nneeded) is made under various \u03a5\u22c6 assumptions (\u03a53.6\n\u22c6 , maximum disk, minimum disk + gas and minimum disk). For\nM81dwB, the asymmetric drift corrected hermite h3 rotation curve is used.\n\n\f18\n\nOh et al.\n\nFig. A.1.- Data: Total intensity maps and velocity fields of IC 2574. (a)(b)(c):: Total intensity maps in Spitzer IRAC 3.6 \u03bcm,\noptical R and B bands. (d): Integrated Hi map (moment 0). The gray-scale levels run from 0 to 600 mJy beam\u22121 km s\u22121 . (e): Velocity\ndispersion map (moment 2). Velocity contours run from 0 to 25 km s\u22121 with a spacing of 5 km s\u22121 . (f ): Position-velocity diagram taken\nalong the average position angle of the major axis as listed in Table 1. Contours start at +2\u03c3 in steps of 8\u03c3. The dashed lines indicate\nthe systemic velocity and position of the kinematic center derived in this paper. Overplotted is the bulk rotation curve corrected for the\naverage inclination from the tilted-ring analysis as listed in Table 1. (g)(h)(i)(j)(k)(l): Velocity fields. Contours run from \u221210 km s\u22121 to\n110 km s\u22121 with a spacing of 20 km s\u22121 .\n\n\fDark and luminous matter in THINGS dwarf galaxies\n\n19\n\nFig. A.2.- Rotation curves: The tilted ring model derived from the bulk velocity field of IC 2574.
