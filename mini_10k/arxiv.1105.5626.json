The corresponding magnetization jump increases gradually starting from\nan S-dependent critical value of exchange couplings and takes a maximum in the vicinity of a\nferromagnetic Lifshitz point. The metamagnetism results from resonances in the dilute magnon gas\ncaused by an interplay between quantum fluctuations and frustration.\nI.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nQuantum spin systems at low temperatures share\nmany of the macroscopic quantum behaviors with systems of bosons such as Bose-Einstein condensation, superfluidity (see Ref. 1 and references therein), or macroscopic quantum tunneling,2 and may indeed be viewed\nas quantum simulators of interacting bosons.1 Spin systems with frustration, in particular, realize exotic phases\nof strongly correlated bosons, such as spin liquids3 or\nsupersolids.4 Experimentally, such systems can be studied both in low-dimensional quantum magnets (see, e.g.,\nRef. 3) and in ultra-cold atomic gases.5,6 In the latter\ncase, interest in the many-body physics has been excited\nby the extraordinary control over interactions between\nbosons via Feshbach resonances.7 These can, in particular, be used to tune interactions from repulsive to attractive. In the attractive regime, the collapse of an ultracold gas of bosons was observed in experiments.8 In this\nwork, we discuss a mechanism by which the same can be\nachieved in spin systems.\nIn the large-S limit, spins map onto bosons with a\nfinite but large Hilbert space, justifying a description in\nterms of soft-core bosons. Yet, in many cases, similarities\nbetween spins and soft-core bosons may even exist for\nS = 1/2. In three dimensions (3D), systems of spins\nand bosons resemble each other the more the smaller the\ndensity of bosons is, whereas 1D spin-S antiferromagnets\nclose to saturation behave as spinless fermions, or hardcore bosons. In spin systems, the external magnetic field\nh tunes the density of magnons. The limit of a dilute gas\nof magnons is then realized as the fully polarized state\n(the vacuum of magnons) is approached from below.\nIn this work, we argue that resonances can play a crucial role in frustrated quantum spin systems largely determining their low-energy behavior in an external magnetic\nfield. We consider the frustrated ferromagnetic (FM)\nspin-S chain and show that upon changing system parameters such as the coupling constants or h, one can\n\ntune the effective interaction between magnons from repulsive to attractive by exploiting the existence of resonances. As a main result, we demonstrate that, close\nto resonances, where the scattering length is much larger\nthan the lattice constant, and in the case of attractive\neffective interactions, the intrinsic hard-coreness of spins\ndoes not play a significant role in the limit of a dilute gas\nof magnons. A behavior resembling the collapse of attractively interacting bosons9,10 therefore exists in such spin\nsystems close to their fully polarized state. The thermodynamic instability of collapsed states causes jumps in\nthe magnetization curve just below saturation. This has\nto be contrasted with the scattering length being of the\norder of a few lattice sites. In that case, which is realized for spin 1/2, the formation of mutually repulsive,\nmulti-magnon bound states can be observed (see, e.g.,\nRefs. 11\u201315).\nOur work demonstrates that the mapping of a purely\n1D spin system close to saturation to an effective theory\nof a dilute Bose gas properly accounts for the physics of\nthe model. This is accomplished by connecting the scattering vertices of the microscopic lattice model with the\ncoupling constants of the effective theory. Furthermore,\ndespite the purely 1D nature of our problem, a 1/S expansion is a valuable tool and yields the correct physics.\nConcretely, we study the following system:\nHS =\n\nL h\ni\nX\n~i * S\n~i+1 + J \u2032 S\n~i * S\n~i+2 \u2212 hS z .\nJS\ni\n\n(1)\n\ni=1\n\n~i = (S x , S y , S z ) is a spin-S operator acting on site i\nS\ni\ni\ni\nand L is the number of sites. J < 0 is the FM, nearestneighbor exchange interaction and J \u2032 = 1 is the antiferromagnetic (AFM), next-nearest-neighbor exchange interaction setting the energy scale. In the absence of an\nexternal field h, HS has a FM ground state for J \u2264 \u22124\nfor all S (see Ref. 16). J = \u22124 is a ferromagnetic Lifshitz\npoint where the quadratic term in the dispersion of the\nmagnons vanishes.\n\n\f2\nSystems with competing FM and AFM interactions are\nof timely interest,17 in particular, the spin-1/2 version of\nEq. (1),11\u201314,18\u201320 motivated by the experimental realizations in, e.g., LiCuVO4 (Refs. 21,22) and Li2 ZrCuO4\n(Ref. 23). The 1D case of J < 0 and S > 1/2 is largely\nunexplored (for J > 0 and S > 1/2, see Refs. 19 and 24).\nWe are mainly interested in the regionP\n\u22124 < J < 0\nand magnetization M = S z /(SL) (S z = i hSiz i) close\nto saturation M = 1, for general spin S. We will proceed\nin three steps: First, in Sec. II, we discuss the solution\nof the two-magnon problem and introduce the scattering length. Second, in Sec. III, we map the low-energy\nlimit of Eq. (1), close to saturation, to a dilute 1D gas of\ntwo species of bosons interacting via an effective shortrange interaction.25,26 We then calculate the interaction\nvertices in this effective theory using a 1/S expansion. Finally, in Sec. IV, we compare the analytical results with\nexact numerical ones using the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) method27,28 and exact diagonalization (ED). We put a particular focus on the case of\nS = 1. A summary of our results is presented in Section V, while technical details of the mapping to a dilute gas and of the 1/S expansion are given in Appendix\nA. A comparison of DMRG results for open boundary\nconditions vs. results for periodic boundary conditions is\nshown in Appendix B.\nII.\nA.\n\nWe now solve the interacting two-magnon problem,\nstarting with the thermodynamic limit (for S = 1/2, see\nRef. 29). On a chain of finite length L with periodic\nboundary conditions the total momentum K is a good\nquantum number due to the translational invariance of\nthe Hamiltonian HS in Eq. (1). Thus, it is convenient to\nuse a basis separating momentum subspaces\n\nl=1\n\n\u2212\neiK(l+r/2) Sl\u2212 Sl+r\n|F i ,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere |F i is the fully polarized state, K = 2q\u03c0/L\n(q = 0, 1, * * * , L \u2212 1) and r is the relative distance of\ntwo magnons. The allowed values of r depend on S and\nthe parity of L and q. For instance, in the case of S > 1/2\nand L even, r = 0, 1, .., L/2 \u2212 1, (L/2) for q odd (even).\nWe expand a general two-magnon state with momentum K into the (unnormalized) basis of Eq.

We have solved this problem,\nwith the momenta of the two magnons (which participate in scattering) taken in the vicinity of the same dispersion minimum, k1 = kcl + k and k2 = kcl \u2212 k.

There are\ntwo types of low-energy scattering processes, first when\nmomenta of two magnons are in the vicinity of the same\ndispersion minimum that we have presented above (intraspecies scattering), and second, when the momenta\nk1 and k2 of two magnons are in the vicinity of different\nminima of dispersion, i.e., k1 = kcl + k and k2 = \u2212kcl \u2212 k\n(interspecies scattering). For the latter case we can repeat all steps presented above and extract another coupling constant g\u03030 from the interspecies scattering length,\n\u00e3S in analogy with Eq. (14). We obtain that g\u03030 > 0 (implying that bound states with total momentum K = 0\nare never formed below the scattering continuum), and\ng\u03030 > g0 for any S in the region \u22124 < J < 0. Since\nthe relation g\u03030 > g0 always holds, the relevant scattering length at low energies is the intraspecies scattering\nlength aS .\nThe scattering length, shown in Fig. 1, can be well\ndescribed, for small S > 1/2, by a sum of two terms\n+\n(resonances): aS \u2243 \u03bb\u2212\nS /(4 + J) + \u03bbS /(Jcr (S) \u2212 J) [where\n\u00b1\n\u03bbS are numerical prefactors]. We emphasize that, for\nS \u2265 1, the scattering length is in general much larger\nthan the lattice spacing, as is evident from Fig. 1: For\nS = 1, aS takes a minimum at J \u2243 \u22123.3 with aS \u2243 80a.\nAdditionally, the emergence of bound states manifests\nitself by a diverging scattering length at Jcr (S), where aS\nchanges its sign jumping from \u2212\u221e to +\u221e. Thus, bound\nstates are typically shallow, with a binding energy given\nby Eq. (10). In addition, the minima in their dispersion\noccur at incommensurate momenta K \u2217 .\nFor S = 1/2, any J < 0 induces a two-magnon bound\nstate with total momentum K = \u03c0,18,20 i.e., aS > 0\nand there is no resonance at \u22124 < J < 0 for S = 1/2.\nHence, S = 1/2 is very different from the S > 1/2 case\nwhere bound states with K = \u03c0 are never below the twomagnon scattering continuum, and, as discussed above,\na resonance exists for \u22124 < J < 0 and 1 \u2264 S < Scr .\nIn order to analyze the finite-size effects with respect\nto results in the thermodynamic limit, we have numerically diagonalized HS in the basis given in Eq. (2)\n(see Ref. 12 for details of the procedure).

Table II shows the numerical\ndetermination of Jcr (S) for S = 1 and different system sizes. Although finite-size effects are apparent, a\nquadratic fit in 1/L to numerical data for Jcr (S) extrapolates to Jcr \u2243 \u22122.11 in agreement with the result determined directly in the thermodynamic limit (see the\npreceding discussion and Table I).\n\nIII.\n\nMAPPING OF THE SPIN HAMILTONIAN\nTO A DILUTE GAS OF BOSONS\n\nIn this section, we describe our effective theory in the\nthermodynamic limit, for the case of a finite (though\nvanishingly small) density of magnons. The mapping\nto a dilute gas of bosons is motivated by the following\nobservation: For S > 1/2, we have shown that aS is\nlarge. Hence in the dilute limit, we can safely neglect\nthe hard-core constraint and take the continuum limit.\nFor S = 1/2, on the contrary, the scattering length aS is\ntypically of the order of a few lattice constants and only\nfor \u22124 < J < \u22123.9 does aS become comparable to the\nsmallest value of the scattering length for S = 1.\nFor S \u2265 1, close to saturation, and in the low-energy\nlimit, we therefore map our system onto a dilute twocomponent gas of bosons interacting with effective shortrange interactions. Many-body effects will be incorporated by properly shifting the two-body T matrix offshell as explained in Ref. 32. We show that, while the\ninterspecies interaction is always repulsive and stronger\nthan the intraspecies interaction, the latter undergoes a\nsign change. When the intraspecies interaction becomes\nnegative, the bosons are unstable against a collapse. We\nshow that a 1/S expansion captures this physics correctly\nand, similar to the case of the (unfrustrated) Heisenberg\nchain,33 is applicable to the present problem, albeit its\none-dimensional nature.\n\nA.\n\nEffective Hamiltonian\n\nUsing the Dyson-Maleev transformation34 (the DysonMaleev representation is used here for convenience.

The\nbare interaction vertex \u03930 is given by \u03930 (q; k, k \u2032 ) =\nVq \u2212 12 (Vk + Vk\u2032 ) with Vk = 2J cos k + 2 cos 2k. The\ncl\nchemical potential is \u03bc = hcl\ns \u2212 h, where hs is the clascl\nsical saturation field value hs = S(J + 4)2 /4. We are\ninterested in the dilute regime \u03bc \u2192 0.\nConcentrating on the low-energy behavior we arrive at,\nvia a Bogoliubov procedure,25,26 a two-component Bose\ngas interacting via a \u03b4-potential with Hamiltonian density\nX |\u2207\u03c8\u03b1 |2 g0 (S)\nHeff =\n\u2212\n+\n(n21 +n22 )+g\u03030 (S) n1 n2 .

The bare coupling constants of the effective 1D model of the two-component\nBose gas, g0 (S) and g\u03030 (S), are, in the dilute limit of\nbosons, related to the renormalized vertices of the microscopic model Eq.

(18) follow from a generalization of the\ncorresponding equation for the case of a one-component\nBose gas32,36 to the two-component case using an RG\nanalysis37 (see Appendix A for details of the calculation).\nB.\n\n1/S expansion\n\nNext, we apply a 1/S expansion to calculate the interaction vertices and extract the coupling constants g0 (S)\nand g\u03030 (S). Using a standard ladder approximation the\nBethe-Salpeter equation for the vertices \u0393 reads:\n\u0393(q; k, k \u2032 ) = \u03930 (q; k, k \u2032 )\n(19)\n\u2032\nX\n1\n\u03930 (q \u2212 p; k + p, k \u2212 p)\n\u2212\n\u0393(p; k, k \u2032 ) .\n2SL p\n\u01ebk+p + \u01ebk\u2032 \u2212p\n\n\f5\n\n1 X (V0 \u2212 Vkcl ) [\u0393(p; kcl , kcl ) \u2212 \u0393(0; kcl , kcl )]\n\u2212\n.\n2SL p\n\u01ebkcl +p + \u01ebkcl \u2212p\n\n(20)\n\nNow, in the spirit of the 1/S expansion, we replace the\nrenormalized vertex with the bare vertex on the right\nhand side of Eq. (20), \u0393(p; kcl , kcl ) \u2192 2\u01ebp , which is possible since there are no infrared divergences. Regularizing\nthe left hand side of Eq. (20) as in Refs. 32,36, and using\nEq. (18) we extract the coupling constants of the effective\nmodel. The analytical expression for g0 (S) is\ng0 (S) =\n\nF\n1\u2212\n\nF (J 2 \u22128)\n|J|S(16\u2212J 2 )3/2\n\n(21)\n\n(the derivation of Eq.

In the same way we calculate g\u03030 (S) as\ng\u03030 (S) =\n\nF\u0303\n1+\n\nJ 2 \u22128\n16S\n\n(23)\n\n(the derivation is presented in detail in Appendix A; see\nEq. (A25) for the expression for F\u0303 ).\nFrom Eqs. (21) and (23), we notice that g0 (S) < g\u03030 (S)\nfor \u22124 < J < 0. Thus the state below saturation is\na single-component one. Provided the interactions are\nrepulsive, the ground state is a translationally invariant\nchiral state,19 where bosons prefer to 'condense' at the\nsame minimum of the single-particle dispersion since they\nexperience a minimal repulsion there.38 We also note that\n|g0 |m \u226a 1 for J < 0, hence interactions between bosons\nare generically weak. In particular, even though m \u2192\n\u221e when approaching the ferromagnetic Lifshitz point,\n|g0 |m \u2192 0.\nThe effective bare intraspecies interaction is depicted\nin Fig. 2 and behaves as g0 (S) \u223c [J \u2212 Jcr (S)] for J \u2192\nJcr (S). The scattering length is related to the effective\ncoupling constant by Eq. (14), signaling a resonance at\nJcr (S). Thus, we see that for S < Scr there is a finite\nregion near J \u2243 \u22124 where g0 (S) < 0 and bosons attract\neach other, producing a collapsed state.\n\n-3\n\n10\n\n0\n\ng0(S)\n\n-3\n\n2 10\n\ng0(S)\n\nSetting the transferred momentum q = 0 in \u0393 and the\nincoming momenta to k = k \u2032 = kcl , we get (see Appendix\nA for details):\n#\n\"\nV0 \u2212 Vkcl X\n1\n=\n\u0393(0; kcl , kcl ) 1 +\n2SL\n\u01ebkcl +p + \u01ebkcl \u2212p\np\n\u0015\n\u0014\nVp \u2212 V0\n1 X\n\u0393(p; kcl , kcl )\n1\u2212\nV0 \u2212 Vkcl +\n2SL p\n\u01ebkcl +p + \u01ebkcl \u2212p\n\n0\n\nS=3/2\nS=1\n\n-0.04\n-0.08\n-4\n\n-3.5\nS=3\nS=10\nS=\u221e\n\n-3\n\n-10\n\n-3\nJ\n\n-2.5\n\n-2\n\n-3\n\n-2 10 -4\n\n-3.9\n\n-3.95\nJ\n\nFIG. 2: (Color online) Effective bare intraspecies interaction\ng0 (S), for S = 3 (solid line), representative of the generic\nbehavior for S < Scr , S = 10 (dashed curve), representative\nof S > Scr [dot-dashed line: g0 (S = \u221e)]. Inset: g0 for S = 1\nand 3/2.\n\nTo corroborate this, using ED for Eq. (1) and S = 1\nwith periodic boundary conditions, we have calculated\nthe ground-state momentum of the states with a small,\nbut finite number of magnons, which is incommensurate,\nsupporting the picture of a uniform chiral state in the\nrepulsive case J > Jcr , and a collapsed state in the attractive case J < Jcr at one of the two minima of the\nsingle-particle dispersion.\nIn the attractive case, \u2202 2 E0 /\u2202n2 < 0, where E0 and\nn are the bosons' ground-state energy and density, respectively. In the language of spins, the inverse magnetic\nsusceptibility at saturation becomes negative, and hence,\nfollowing standard arguments,39 we conclude that there\nis a first-order transition at M = 1, i.e., a jump in the\nmagnetization curve just below saturation.\nAs pointed out above, the case of S = 1/2 is special\nsince the scattering length is typically of the order of the\nlattice constant here. The mapping of the S = 1/2 case to\na two-component Bose gas (by the procedure presented\nabove for S > 1/2) can be trusted only for J \u2192 \u22124,\nwhere the scattering length becomes much larger than\nthe lattice constant. In that case we can easily incorporate the exact hard-core constraint into our formalism26\nand again expect that S = 1/2 also shows metamagnetic behavior. This conclusion is in agreement with\nDMRG results for S = 1/2.14 Note that a metamagnetic\njump can also be stabilized for spin 1/2 with suitable\nanisotropic exchange interactions.40,41 However, with our\nprocedure we cannot account for the formation of stable\ntwo-, three-, and four-magnon bound states that is characteristic for most of the region J > \u22124 in the spin-1/2\nfrustrated ferromagnetic Heisenberg chain.12\u201314,20\nGoing back to S > 1/2, at lower M , corresponding to\nhigher densities of magnons, the hard-core nature of spins\neventually prevails as well, resulting in a uniform ground\nstate at a nonzero momentum. However, as already mentioned, from the finite-size analysis of the two-magnon\nproblem, we observe that bound states disappear with decreasing L, suggesting that the attractive effective potential (in the limit of a small magnon density) can become\n\n\f6\n(a) S=1, L=128\n1\n\nz\n\n1-<S i>\n\nM(h)\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n0.4\nJ=-3.5\nJ=-3\nJ=-2.5\n0.6\n0.5\n\n0.2\n0\n0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n(b) S=1, J=-1\n\n0.3\nh\n\n0.4\n\n0.9\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n0.4\n\n0.7\n\n0.2 hc\n\n0.6\n1.5\nh\n\n2\n\n2.5 0.07\n\n0.08\n\n0.09\nh\n\n0.1\n\nM(h)\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\n0.2\n0.1\n0\n0\n\n0.5\n\nFIG. 3: (Color online) (a) Magnetization curves M (h) for\nS = 1 at J = \u22122.5, \u22123, \u22123.5.

For S = 1, we observe the appearance of this jump for \u22124 < J . \u22122, while for S = 3/2\n[an example is shown in Fig. 3(c)] the jump exists in a\nmuch narrower window J . \u22123. This is consistent with\nour analytical results for Jcr , listed in Tab. I. Moreover,\nfor \u22122 . J < 0, we resolve a plateau in M (h) at M = 0,\nwhich is due to the Haldane gap43 in this S = 1 system\n[see Fig. 3(b)].

We have fitted the expression Eq. (25) to our\nnumerical data (shown as solid lines in the figure) and obtain c = 1.0 \u00b1 0.1 in all examples. Therefore, we expect\nthe gapless phase to be a (chiral) one-component liquid.\nNote, though, that at both small M and |J|, where the\nconvergence of DMRG is notoriously difficult, we cannot completely rule out the presence of a c = 2 region,\nwhich, however, is irrelevant for the main conclusions of\nour work.\n\nC.\n\n2 -4\n\nPhase diagram for S = 1\n\nOur results for the S = 1 chain are summarized in the\nh vs. J phase diagram Fig. 6. We identify three phases:\n(i) a gapped M = 0 phase at h < hc (similar to the\nDouble-Haldane phase known for J > 0, see Ref. 46), (ii)\na gapless (chiral) finite-field phase for hc < h < hsat , and\n(iii) the fully polarized state at hsat < h (with hsat = 0\nfor J < \u22124).\n\u2206Mjump is plotted in the inset of Fig. 6: the jump sets\nin at J . \u22122 (close to where the zero-field gap becomes\nsmall rendering it difficult to resolve it numerically), consistent with our theory.\nSince in the limit of J \u2192 0, one has two spin-1\nchains with antiferromagnetic interactions which both\nseparately have a Haldane gap at zero field,43 upon\ncoupling the chains, one obtains the so-called DoubleHaldane phase (in contrast to the regular Haldane phase\nthat is inherited from a single spin-1 chain with antiferromagnetic interactions). Both phases, Double-Haldane\nand Haldane phase, are realized in the frustrated, antiferromagnetic spin-1 chain,46 yet in our case, only the\nDouble-Haldane phase exists.

The comparison of L = 64 (open symbols) and L = 128 (solid symbols)\nas well as finite-size scaling (not shown here) supports that\nboth \u2206Mjump and hc are finite in extended regions of J.\n\ncorresponding spin gap hc is a bit subtle. Namely, a Haldane chain with open boundaries gives rise to spin-1/2\nexcitations at the open ends.47 Since we have two chains\n(for small |J|), we have a total of four spin-1/2 end spins.\nHence, the spin gap in Fig. 6 is determined from\nhc = E(S z = 3) \u2212 E(S z = 2) ,\n\n(26)\n\nwhere E(S z ) is the ground-state energy in a sector with\na given total S z .\nIt is worth emphasizing several differences with the\nphase diagram of the spin-1/2 version of Eq. (1). First,\nfor S = 1, there are no multipolar phases, which occupy a large portion of the corresponding spin-1/2 phase\ndiagram.11\u201314,20 Second, the spin-1/2 system features an\ninstability towards nematic order,11,12,18 which can be\nexcluded on general grounds for integer spin-S chains,19\neven for 0 < M \u226a 1.\nV.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nIn conclusion, we showed that resonances can play a\ncrucial role in determining the low-energy behavior of\nfrustrated quantum spin systems subject to a magnetic\nfield. The proximity of resonances caused by an interplay\nbetween frustration (J > \u22124) and quantum fluctuations\n(1/2 < S < Scr ) results in extremely large values of the\n1D scattering length that allows to develop an effective\ntheory of a weakly interacting two-component Bose gas.\nThe quasi-collapse of the dilute gas of magnons provides\nthe physical origin of the emergent metamagnetism.\nThe preditictions of our analytic theory were verified\nby numerical data. We focused on the case S = 1 since\nthere the jump in the magnetization curve is the most\npronounced. As a by-product, we obtained the phase\ndiagram for the S = 1 J-J \u2032 chain with antiferromagnetic\nJ \u2032 and ferromagnetic J in a magnetic field. This phase\ndiagram is remarkably simple. In particular, there are no\n\n\f8\nmultipolar phases in the case S = 1, in marked contrast\nto the spin-1/2 case.11\u201314,20\nAcknowledgments\n\nWe thank H. Frahm, A. Kolezhuk, R.

We will show below that incorporating\nquantum fluctuations does not modify this relation.\nIn the following we will calculate the effective intraspecies and interspecies interaction constants, to see\nhow 1/S corrections modify g0 (S) and g\u03030 (S). In order to\nobtain g(S) we have to set in \u0393(q, k, k \u2032 ) given by Eq.

(1)\nclose to saturation to an effective, bosonic field theory\nEq. (17). Here we provide the details of generalizing the\nprocedure of obtaining the coupling constants from the\nmany-body T-matrix for an effective single-component\nBose gas model, which is described in Ref. 32, to the\ncase relevant to us here, namely an effective theory of a\ntwo-component Bose gas.\nWe introduce the 'mean-field interaction coefficients',\ng(S) = \u0393(0; kcl , kcl )\n(A1)\ng\u0303(S) = \u0393(0; kcl , \u2212kcl ) + \u0393(\u22122kcl ; kcl , \u2212kcl ) , (A2)\nwhere \u0393(q; k, k \u2032 ) is the full interaction vertex of the\nHamiltonian Eq. (16). They satisfy mean-field like relations for g\u03030 > g0 ,\n\u03bc = g(S)n\n\n(A3)\n\n\u03bc = (g(S) + g\u0303(S))n/2,\n\n(A4)\n\nand for g\u03030 < g0\n\nP\nwhere n = h \u03b1 n\u03b1 i \u2192 0 is the total density of bosons.\nTo get the connection between g(S) and g\u0303(S) on the one\nhand and the bare coupling constants of the effective 1D\nmodel of a two-component Bose gas, g0 (S) and g\u03030 (S) on\nthe other hand, we generalize the corresponding equation\nfor the case of a one-component Bose gas32 to the twocomponent case, consistent with the SU (2) symmetry of\nthe RG fixed point of a dilute, two-component\nBose gas,37\n\u221a \u221a\nlim\u03bc\u21920 g(S) = lim\u03bc\u21920 g\u0303(S) = \u03c0 \u03bc/ 2m,\ng0 (S)\n\u221a\n\u221a ,\n1 + g0 (S) 2m/(\u03c0 \u03bc)\ng\u03030 (S)\n\u221a\ng\u0303(S) =\n\u221a .\n1 + g\u03030 (S) 2m/(\u03c0 \u03bc)\n\ng(S) =\n\n(A5)\n(A6)\n\nTo zeroth order in 1/S, we have\ng(S = \u221e) = V0 \u2212 Vkcl =\n\n(J + 4)2\n4\n\n(A7)\n\n(A8)\n\n\u2212\n\n1 X\n\u0393p\n2SL p\n\n1 X Vp \u2212 V0 + V0 \u2212 Vkcl\n\u0393p , (A9)\n2SL p\n\u01ebkcl +p + \u01ebkcl \u2212p\n\nwhere we have denoted \u0393(p; kcl , kcl ) = \u0393p .

In\npanel (a), we clearly see the metamagnetic jump of height\n\u2206Mjump and in panel (b), the Haldane gap that defines hc\nshows up as a zero-field magnetization plateau.\n\nhere demonstrate that all main features can be seen with\nboth OBC and PBC, namely the existence of the metamagnetic jump and the Haldane gap. Moreover, the\nquantitative results are comparable, except for the expected finite-size effects due to the incommensurability.\n\n1.\n\nMagnetization curves from periodic boundary\nconditions for S = 1\n\nFirst, we discuss some examples of magnetization\ncurves obtained for PBC. We kept up to m = 1600 states\nfor the PBC DMRG computations presented here. In\naddition, we used exact diagonalization for those sectors\nwhich are sufficiently small. Therefore, in particular the\ndata close to the saturation field are free of truncation\nerrors.\nFigure 7 shows the magnetization curves for J = \u22123.5\n[panel (a)] and J = \u22121 [panel (b)] for L = 48 and PBC.\nAs in the results for OBC, we observe the presence of the\nmetamagnetic jump (here in the case of J = \u22123.5) and\nthe Haldane gap (see the J = \u22121 curve), which manifests\nitself as a plateau in the magnetization curve at M = 0.\nThe latter defines the critical field hc that separates the\ngapped Double-Haldane phase from the gapless finite-M\nphase (compare Fig. 5).\nNote that at intermediate M , the PBC data show spurious small steps with \u2206S z > 1.

(26), E(S z ) is the ground-state energy in\na sector with a given total S z . The good agreement between the OBC and PBC results for hc in Fig. 8 confirms\nthat it is indeed appropriate to use Eq. (26) for OBC.\nThe PBC data for \u2206Mjump in Fig. 8 suffer from the\npresence of several peaks, resulting in a non-monotonic\ndependence on J. This is due to the incommensurability in the finite-magnetization region, which is incompatible with the lattice vectors of a system with periodic boundary conditions that is translationally invariant. Therefore, in the main text we focus on the discussion of DMRG data from systems with OBC. The results\nfrom OBC and PBC data for the saturation field hsat ,\nhowever, agree very well with each other.\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n\n32\n\n33\n\n34\n\n35\n36\n\nF.
