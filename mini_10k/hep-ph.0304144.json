A central role for the nonet is played by f0 (980) which\nhas been considered not only as standard qq meson but also as KK-molecule\nor as 4-quark state.\nThe spectroscopic data often have not been precise enough to arrive at\nunique conclusions. New results on D and B decays of high statistics are\nnow providing additional information. In this paper we discuss some recent\nexperimental results and their implications on these problems:\n1. The observation by the BELLE collaboration of charmless decays B \u2192\nKhh with h = \u03c0, K [1,2] which show a significant signal of f0 (980);\nthis has been observed recently also by the BaBar collaboration [3].\n2. In the same channel BELLE has also observed a broad enhancement in\nKK mass spectrum in the range 1000-1700 MeV with spin J = 0 and a\nsmaller effect in \u03c0\u03c0 around 1000 MeV. Preliminary results from BaBar\n[4] confirm this effect but there is no quantitative analysis yet.\n3. A significant signal of f0 (980), larger than expected, has also been observed in a first analysis of the leading system in gluon jets obtained\nby DELPHI at LEP [5].\nThe interest in charmless B-decays with strangeness has been stimulated\nthrough the observation by CLEO [6,7] of large inclusive and exclusive decay\nrates B \u2192 \u03b7 \u2032 X and B \u2192 \u03b7 \u2032 K, which have been confirmed by more recent measurements [8,9,10]. These processes have been related to the decay\nb \u2192 sg of the b-quark which could be a source of mesons with large gluon\naffinity [11,12,13,14]. In consequence, besides \u03b7 \u2032 also other gluonic states, in\nparticular also scalar mesons or glueballs could be produced in a similar way.\nThe total rate b \u2192 sg has been calculated perturbatively in leading [15]\nand next-to-leading order [16]\n(\n(2 \u2212 5) \u00d7 10\u22123 in LO (for \u03bc = mb . . . mb /2)\n(1)\nBr(b \u2192 sg) =\n(5 \u00b1 1) \u00d7 10\u22123 in NLO\nThe energetic massless gluon in this process could turn entirely into gluonic\nmesons by a nonperturbative transition after colour neutralization by a second gluon. Alternatively, colour neutralization through qq pairs is possible as\nwell. This is to be distinguished from the short distance process b \u2192 sqq with\n1\n\n\fvirtual intermediate gluon which has to be added to the CKM-suppressed\ndecays b \u2192 q1 q 2 q2 . These quark processes with s have been calculated and\namount to branching fractions of \u223c 2 \u00d7 10\u22123 each [17,18,16]. The question\nthen arises which hadronic final states correspond to the decay b \u2192 sg.\nHere we discuss how the above new results and further measurements\ncan clarify the low mass spectroscopy of scalar particles and their contribution to the gluonic B decays. In a previous study [19] we have performed\na detailed phenomenological analysis of production and decay of low mass\nscalar mesons, which led us to identify the scalar nonet with the states\na0 (980), f0 (980), K0\u2217 (1430) and f0 (1500) with large flavour mixing, just as\nin the pseudoscalar nonet. The near flavour singlet states are the parity partners \u03b7 \u2032 and f0 (980) whereas near flavour octet states are \u03b7 and f0 (1500). This\nscalar nonet fulfills the Gell Mann-Okubo mass formula and is also consistent with a general QCD potential model. The left over states f0 (400 \u2212 1200)\n(also called \u03c3(600)) and f0 (1370) seen in \u03c0\u03c0 and other channels have been\ninterpreted as signals from a single broad object centered around 1 GeV with\na large width of 500-1000 MeV which we take as the 0++ glueball. In this paper we discuss how this scheme compares with the new data and how further\nmeasurement could clarify the structure of the scalar sector.\nThere are alternative schemes for low mass qq and glueball spectroscopy\nwhich include: light qq nonet like ours, except for a0 (980) but no glueball [20];\nQCD sum rule analysis [21] with f0 (980) and broad \u03c3 around 1000 MeV, both\nmixed in equal parts from glueball and light quark scalar; a broad glueball\nin the range 1000-1600 MeV from overlapping f0 states in K matrix analyses\n(recent results [22]) but with f0 (980) near flavour octet. B decays may clarify\nthese alternatives.\n\n2\n\nCharmless B decays with K and K \u2217(890)\n\nTwo-body decays into pseudoscalar and vector mesons PP and PV\nWe begin by reconsidering the decays B \u2192 K\u03b7 \u2032 , K \u2217 \u03b7 \u2032 together with other\nfinal states related by U(3) symmetry. Subsequently we wish to extend these\nconsiderations to the inclusion of scalar particles. The large branching fraction B \u2192 K\u03b7 \u2032 confirms the special role of \u03b7 \u2032 in these decays and it has been\nrelated [11,12,13,14] to the gluon affinity of \u03b7 \u2032 , especially through the QCD\naxial anomaly which affects only the flavour singlet component. However, it\nappears difficult to explain the K\u03b7 \u2032 rate entirely by quark final states and the\nQCD anomaly within a perturbative framework [23], a factor 2 remains unexplained. An improvement is possible by inclusion of radiative corrections\n[24] but with considerable uncertainties.\n2\n\n\fAlternatively, one may introduce a phenomenological flavour singlet amplitude which allows also for non-perturbative effects [14]. This amplitude is\nadded to the dominant penguin amplitudes, the small tree amplitudes and\nelectroweak penguins. Different decays are related by flavour U(3) symmetry.\nRecent applications [25] of this scheme to 2-body B decays with strange and\nnonstrange pseudoscalar and vector particles yield a good overall agreement\nwith the data in terms of a few phenomenological input amplitudes.\nHere we discuss first the 2-body B decays with K and K \u2217 in this way\n[25] to understand the pattern of the observed rates and then extend the\nanalysis to the scalar sector. For this purpose we restrict ourselves to a\nsimple approximation and at short distances we keep only the dominant\nQCD penguin amplitudes Tq for b \u2192 uus, dds, sss with Tu = Td = Ts .\nThe hadronic penguin amplitude pAB for the 2-body B decay into particles\nfrom U(3) multiplets A and B are then proportional to the superposition of\nshort distance amplitudes Tq corresponding to the quark composition of the\nfinal hadrons; in addition, there is the contribution from the flavour singlet\namplitude which we write as \u03b3AB pAB . \u221a\nThe quark mixing in the pseudoscalar\n\u221a\nsector is taken as \u03b7 = (uu + dd \u2212 ss)/ 3 and \u03b7 \u2032 = (uu + dd + 2ss)/ 6, see\nTable 1.\nIf the two particles belong to two different multiplets then pAB is the\namplitude for the A particle carrying the s quark from b \u2192 sg decay and the\nB particle carrying the spectator quark qs . The amplitude for both particles\ninterchanged, i.e. s \u2192 B, qs \u2192 A, is written as \u03b2AB pAB . In case of B-decays\ninto mesons with ss component (\u03b7, \u03b7 \u2032 , \u03c6 . . .) both amplitudes contribute and\ninterfere with full amplitude pAB (1 + (\u22121)L \u03b2AB ) where the second term with\n\u03b2 \u2032 = (\u22121)L \u03b2 refers to the 2-particle state with reflected momenta (~p \u2192 \u2212~p)\nfor orbital angular momentum L [26]. In particular, for B \u2192 V P decays\nthere is a relative (\u2212) sign for the interchange amplitude.\nConcerning our leading penguin approximation we note the following: the\ndecay rates at the quark level including penguin and tree amplitudes have\nbeen calculated [18,16] and the quark decays of interest to us are found with\nrelative fractions [18] 22% (b \u2192 uus), 18% (b \u2192 dds) and 15% (b \u2192 sss) of\nall charmless B decays. So the nonleading weak decay amplitudes which we\nneglect here modify the leading result from penguins by about \u00b120%.

Then all\nbranching ratios are given in terms of one overall normalization parameter\n(pP P ). The corresponding predictions are given in column 3 (in units of pP P\nand pV P ) and 4 of Table 1. The predictions for B 0 are obtained after multiplying |pAB |2 by the ratio \u03c4B0 /\u03c4B+ = 0.921. We compare with experimental\ndata compiled by the PDG [27] which includes \u03b7 and \u03b7 \u2032 decays [8,9,10].\nOne can see that for P P decays the overall pattern is reproduced, except for K\u03b7 \u2032 which is observed significantly too large by a factor \u223c 3. In\nthis scheme this conclusion is derived from flavour symmetry, the neglect of\nnonleading short distance terms was only about 20%. Agreement with data\ncan be obtained by adding the flavour singlet amplitude with \u03b3 = 0.53 which\npredicts also effects for \u03b7. Too large predictions are found in this approximation for the V P decays \u03c6K, K \u22170 \u03c0 0 , \u03c9K + and \u03c1K 0 . A solution is possible by\nchoosing a different normalization \u03b1 = 0.67 for V P decays keeping \u03b3 \u2032 = \u03b3.\nWith this choice the model can also reproduce the decay pattern of\nB \u2192 K \u2217 (890) + (\u03c0, \u03b7, \u03b7 \u2032) with reversed abundances of \u03b7 and \u03b7 \u2032 . This is a\nconsequence of the different sign of \u03b2 \u2032 in the PP and VP amplitudes [26,25],\na feature also present in other analyses [23,24] for the same reason. One can\nestimate the gluonic part of the \u03b7 \u2032 K + production alone (without interference)\nfrom contributions \u223c |\u03b3|2 to \u03b7K + and \u03b7 \u2032 K + rates and obtains\nBr(B + \u2192 \u03b7 \u2032 K + )|gluonic = (8/3) |\u03b3 pP P |2 \u223c (15 . . . 35) \u00d7 10\u22126\n\n(2)\n\nwhere the smaller number refers to real \u03b3 = 0.53 and the second one to\narbitrary gamma with |\u03b3| = 0.88 (see also [25]), Re\u03b3 < 0 would be in conflict\nwith the K + \u03b7 rate.\nAt this level of approximation, accurate to \u223c 20%, there are no major\ndiscrepencies encountered. We conclude that the main effects are reproduced\nby 3 parameters, the two penguin amplitudes pP P and pV P and the gluonic\namplitude with \u03b3, furthermore we have chosen \u03b2 = 1 and \u03b3 \u2032 = \u03b3 \u2261 \u03b3P .\nDecay B \u2192 f0 (980)K and expectations for scalar particles\nA remarkably strong signal is observed for the scalar meson f0 (980) by the\nBELLE Collaboration [1] in the decay B + \u2192 K + \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 where almost one\nhalf of the total rate above background falls into this sub-channel with\n+2.5+1.5+3.4\nBr (B + \u2192 K + f0 (980); f0 (980) \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 ) = (9.6\u22122.3\u22121.5\u22120.8\n) \u00d7 10\u22126.

To this end we have written\ndown in Table 2 the amplitudes for the decays B \u2192 P S and B \u2192 V S\nin the approximation as above, keeping only the QCD penguin and gluonic\namplitudes pP S , pV S and \u03b3S pP S , \u03b3S pV S (\u03b3S \u2261 \u03b3P S \u2261 \u03b3V S ). We assume the\nscalar nonet with states as in Ref. [19]. Because of the large phase space in\nB decays there is a good chance to identify the scalar particles belonging to\nthe nonet of lowest mass with little background from crossed decay channels.\nIn order to determine the gluonic production amplitude \u03b3S for f0 (980) one\nneeds to identify additional channels, in particular with a(980) and K \u2217 (1430),\nthe suggested partners of pion and kaon, respectively. The latter state has\napparently been observed by BELLE [1] (called KX (1400)) albeit with large\n\u22170 +\n\u22126\nerror (Br(B + \u2192 Ksc\n\u03c0 ) \u223c (21.7+7.6\n\u221211.3 ) \u00d7 10 ). Measurements together with\nK \u2217 (890) can reveal the different effects the gluonic amplitude has on f0 (980)\n6\n\n\fand f0 (1500), the suggested partners of \u03b7 \u2032 and \u03b7. Given several rates for pure\nquark states the scalar mixing angle \u03c6S defined through\nf0 (980) = nn sin \u03c6S + ss cos \u03c6S , f0 (1500) = nn cos \u03c6S \u2212 ss sin \u03c6S\n(5)\n\u221a\nwith nn =\u221a(uu + dd)/ 2 can be determined as well. Our choice [19] is\nsin \u03c6S = 1/ 3 as in the pseudoscalar nonet, i.e. \u03c6P \u2248 \u03c6S .\nThe strong appearence of f0 (980) in the final state with intermediate\ngluons points toward a flavour singlet component. As further test we note\nthat in the approximation of Table 2 the decay B \u2192 Kf0 (1500) should be\nsuppressed in analogy to K\u03b7. Indeed, there is no signal from \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 or K + K \u2212\nat this mass in the BELLE data [1] (assuming f0 (1500) is the partner in the\nsame nonet), however, there is a large branching ratio of f0 (1500) also into 4\u03c0.\nOn the other hand, f0 (1500) should show up together with K \u2217 . Furthermore\nwe note that f0 (980) could interfere destructively with the background which\nwould result in a much larger decay rate. This occurs for the amplitude\nTB + Tf0 e2i\u03c6B in case of background phase \u03c6B \u223c \u03c0/2 (|TB | \u226a |Tf0 | here,\nT = |T |ei\u03c6 ) as we expect for our glueball interpretation below.\nNext we consider a possible mechanism for the B \u2192 f0 (980)K decay\nsimilar to B \u2192 \u03b7 \u2032 K assuming a direct coupling to a two gluon state. Then\nwe expect that the gluonic couplings of \u03b7 \u2032 and f0 are proportional to the\ncorresponding processes with photons. In consequence, the ratios\nR1 =\n\nBr(B \u2192 f0 (980)K)|gluonic\n|\u03b3S pP S |2\n=\n,\nBr(B \u2192 \u03b7 \u2032 K)|gluonic\n|\u03b3P pP P |2\n\nR2 =\n\n\u0393(f0 (980) \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3)\n(6)\n\u0393(\u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3)\n\nshould be of comparable size if indeed the mixing angles \u03c6P \u2248 \u03c6S , then the\nquark charge factors cancel in R2 . Taking \u0393(\u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3) = (4.29 \u00b1 0.15) keV\nand \u0393(f0 (980) \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3) = (0.39+0.10\n\u22120.13 ) keV [27] we obtain R2 \u223c 0.09 \u00b1 0.03.\nWith the assumption R1 \u2248 R2 and together with the decay rate (3) or\n(4) using Table 1 for \u03b7 \u2032 K we can actually determine \u03b3S and pP S taken as real\nparameters. With Br(B + \u2192 f0 (980)K + ) \u223c (14 \u00b1 4) \u00d7 10\u22126 after correction\nfor \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 decay of f0 and neglecting KK we find two solutions\nA: \u03b3S = \u22120.17, p2P S = 15 \u00d7 10\u22126 ;\n\nB: \u03b3S = 0.3, p2P S = 5 \u00d7 10\u22126 (7)\n\n\u22170 \u00b1\nAccording to Table 2 the Ksc\n\u03c0 and Ka\u00b1 rates are of order p2P S . If we\n\u22170 +\ntake the quoted BELLE result on Ksc\n\u03c0 into account, then Solution A is\nfavoured. In this solution the rates for K \u2217 f0 , K \u2217 f0\u2032 are \u223c 7\u03b1S2 \u00d7 10\u22126 and\n\u223c 17\u03b1S2 \u00d7 10\u22126 resp. whereas the same rates in Solution B are \u223c 0.0 \u00d7 10\u22126\nand \u223c 9\u03b1S2 \u00d7 10\u22126 where \u03b1S = pV S /pP S .\nTotal rate for gluonic decays\nNext we compare the rates for f0 and \u03b7 \u2032 production with the total rate b \u2192 sg\n\n7\n\n\fin (1). CLEO [7] has measured the inclusive non-charm decay Br(B \u2192 \u03b7 \u2032 +\n\u22124\nX) = (6.2+2.1\n\u22122.6 ) \u00d7 10 , where the signal refers to the region 2.0 < p\u03b7\u2032 < 2.7\n\u2032\nGeV of the \u03b7 momentum. Identifying the non-charm rate with Xs according\nto the SM and adding the exclusive \u03b7 \u2032 K rate we obtain the inclusive rate\nBr(B \u2192 \u03b7 \u2032 + Xs ) \u223c 7.0 \u00d7 10\u22124 , so the total inclusive \u03b7 \u2032 Xs rate is about 9\ntimes larger than the exclusive \u03b7 \u2032 K rate. We take the gluonic part as in (2)\nand add a gluonic contribution for f0 (980) of fraction R2 \u223c 10%. Then we\nfind for the fully inclusive contribution of these decays\nBr(B \u2192 \u03b7 \u2032 , f0 (980))|gluonic ) \u223c (1.5 . . . 3.5) \u00d7 10\u22124 .\n\n(8)\n\nHence, these decays cannot contribute more than \u223c (3 \u2212 7)% of the expected\nb \u2192 sg rate of 5 \u00d7 10\u22123 [16]. We will argue below that glueball production\ndoes provide the dominant part of the b \u2192 sg decay with \"real\" gluon.\n\n3\n\nGluon jet fragmenting into f0(980)\n\nGluonic mesons should also be found as leading particles in gluon jets [28,12,29,30,31].\nFollowing the proposal in ref. [30] the 3-jet events obtained by DELPHI at\nLEP have been used to isolate the leading component in gluon jets. Events\nhave been selected with a rapidity gap in this jet and first results have been\npresented [5]. The charge of the leading component of the gluon jet beyond\nthe rapidity gap has been compared with the MC simulation. Whereas the\nquark jets showed good agreement with this calculation the gluon jets had an\nexcess of jets with charge Q = 0 as expected for an extra gluonic component.\nThe \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 mass spectrum showed the Q = 0 excess spread over a large mass\nrange with considerable fluctuations, but in the low mass region a significant\npeak is found for f0 (980), absent in quark jets. This is a strong hint at the\ngluonic affinity of f0 (980), i.e. its flavour singlet nature.\nResults are desirable from energetic jets with large gaps and good separation from neighbour jets to minimize background. Such jets with high pT\nare produced also in hadronic or ep collisions.\n\n4\n\nGlueball production in B decays\n\nBesides the observation of the strong f0 (980) signal in charmless B decays,\nthere is another interesting feature in the decays B + \u2192 K + \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 and B + \u2192\nK + K \u2212 K + observed by the BELLE collaboration [1]. The latter channel\nshows a broad enhancement in the K + K \u2212 mass spectrum in the region 1.0 \u2212\n1.7 GeV. The flat distribution in the Dalitz plot of these events suggests\n8\n\n\fthis object to be produced with spin J = 0. Its contribution has been\nparametrized as scalar state fX (1500) with mass M = 1500 MeV and \u0393 = 700\nMeV. There is no sign of a particular narrow resonance such as f0 (1500) with\nwidth of about 100 MeV; this latter state should be seen more clearly in the\n\u03c0\u03c0 spectrum, given the small ratio \u0393(KK)/\u0393(\u03c0\u03c0) = 0.19 \u00b1 0.07 [32] but\nthere is no sign here either in the same experiment.\nIn the \u03c0\u03c0 mass spectrum in B + \u2192 K + \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 there are enhancements\naround f0 (980) in the region 0.7-1.4 GeV. In this case, because of high background and smaller statistics, the spin is not so obvious but at least some\nJ = 0 component is apparently present. The enhancement above 1 GeV has\nbeen related to f0 (1370). Similar results have been reported by BaBar [3].\nIn our earlier study of low mass scalars [19] we interpreted the \u03c0\u03c0 S wave\nas being dominated by a very broad scalar state which interferes destructively\nwith narrow f0 (980) and f0 (1500) (\"red dragon\") and extends in mass up to\nabout 1600 MeV. This broad object, corresponding to f0 (400 \u2212 1200) and\nf0 (1370) listed by the PDG, we classified as scalar glueball gb(1000) after the\nother low mass scalar states have been filled into the qq nonet. We argued\nthat the Breit Wigner phase motion for f0 (1370) has not been demonstrated\nclearly enough to require an extra state.\nWe consider the enhancements in \u03c0\u03c0 and KK observed by BELLE as\na new, very clear manifestation of this broad scalar glueball. Whereas the\ncenter of the peak in \u03c0\u03c0 is closer to 1 GeV, it is shifted to higher mass in the\nKK channel. Because of the large width the branching ratios into different\nchannels vary strongly with mass depending on the respective thresholds.\nThe shape of the mass spectrum is also expected to vary from one reaction\nto another because different kinematic and dynamic factors may apply.\nIn order to relate different channels and to obtain an estimate of the\ntotal glueball production rate we consider the following decay scheme. The\nglueball decays first into qq pairs (possibly glueballs)\ngb \u2192 uu + dd + ss (+gb gb)\n\n(9)\n\nsubsequently, each of these qq pairs recombines with a newly created pair\nuu, dd or ss where ss is produced with amplitude S (|S| < 1). In this way\nthe 2-body channels gb \u2192 qq \u2032 + qq \u2032 are opened, at low energies just pairs of\npseudoscalars. They are produced with probabilities\n\u03c0+\u03c0\u2212 \u03c00\u03c00\n2\n\n1\n\n2\n\n1\n\nK +K \u2212\n\nK 0K\n\n2\n\n2\n\n1\n|1\n2\n\n+ S|2\n\n1\n|1\n2\n\n0\n\n+ S|2\n\n9\n\n1\n|2\n9\n\n\u03b7\u03b7\n\n\u03b7\u2032\u03b7\u2032\n\n1\n\n1\n\n+ S|2\n\n1\n|1\n9\n\n+ 2S|2\n\n(10)\n\n\fTable 3: Observed [1] and corrected/expected branching ratios for B \u2192\nK + gb(0++ ) decays for different 2-body channels (with S = 0.8).\nmass range BrB+ \u2192RK + \u00d7\n[GeV]\n\n1.0 \u2212 1.7\n\n1.0 \u2212 1.3\n\n\u00d7BrR\u2192h+ h\u2212 [10\u22126 ]\n\ncorr./exp.

With increasing glueball mass\nthe qq pairs can decay also into pairs of vector mesons or of other states but\nthe total rates in (10) are assumed to remain unaltered.\nWe study first the mass region 1.0-1.7 GeV. In this region the pseudoscalars alone saturate the KK rate in (10) as K \u2217 K is forbidden by parity\n\u2217\nand K \u2217 K is kinematically suppressed. Another possible decay is \u03b7\u03b7, contributions from higher mass isoscalars (\u03c9\u03c9) are only possible at the upper edge\nof the considered mass interval. The decay \u03b7 \u2032 \u03b7 \u2032 is kinematically forbidden.\nOn the other hand, the \u03c0\u03c0 channel can get contributions from higher states,\nin particular \u03c1\u03c1 which becomes effective in the mass region above 1300 MeV.\nNext we estimate the total glueball rate. In Table 3 we start from the\nobserved KK rate in the mass interval 1.0-1.7 GeV and derive using (10)\nthe rates for \u03b7\u03b7 and \"\u03c0\u03c0\" where the latter includes \u03c1\u03c1. This yields the rate\n(124\u00b137)\u00d710\u22126. We may compare the prediction for \"\u03c0\u03c0\" with the observed\n\u03c0\u03c0 rate in the region around f0 (1370) which we consider as part of the\nglueball. Its decay properties are not well known, but there is a considerable\nfraction into 4\u03c0, in particular \u03c1\u03c1. If the result from the extrapolation of \u03c0\u03c0\nalone (\u223c 64 \u00d7 10\u22126 ) is multiplied by factor 2 in order to account for the\nlarger mass interval of KK, then both results (predicted and extrapolated)\nare consistent within the very large errors (Table 3).\nFinally, from the total rate B + \u2192 K + gb(0++ ) \u223c 132 \u00d7 10\u22126 in Table 3\n10\n\n\fobtained by adding the low mass interval we may estimate the total inclusive\nrate by applying the same factor 9 as in case of \u03b7 \u2032 in the extrapolation\nK + \u2192 Xs and find\nBr(B + \u2192 gb(0++ ) + Xs ) \u223c 1.2 \u00d7 10\u22123\n\n(11)\n\nIf we add the gluonic \u03b7 \u2032 Xs and f0 (980)Xs contributions in (8) then we estimate the total production of observed gluonic mesons as\nBr(B + \u2192 gb(0++ ) + f0 + \u03b7 \u2032 + Xs ) \u223c (1.5 \u00b1 0.5) \u00d7 10\u22123\n\n(12)\n\nwhich is of the same size as the leading order result for the process b \u2192 sg\nin (1) and about 1/3 of the full rate obtained in NLO.\nBesides the scalar glueball other glueballs should be produced as well.\nFor orientation, it is plausible to assume\nBr(B \u2192 gb(0++ ) + Xs )\n\n\u2248\n\nBr(B \u2192 gb(0\u2212+ ) + Xs )\n\n(13)\n\nThis is obtained if one assumes a symmetry under chromoelectric-magnetic\nrotation F \u2192 F\u0303 for the operators F 2 and F F\u0303 and approximately neglects\nthe breaking of this symmetry. In this case the scalar and pseudoscalar\ngluonic mesons would add up to about B \u2192 (J = 0) glue mesons \u223c 3 \u00d7 10\u22123\nwhich is close to the total gluonic decay rate b \u2192 sg. Given the errors in\nthese estimates the counted decays could actually saturate the total rate,\nalternatively, there is room for glueballs with higher spin or hybrid states.\n\n5\n\nConclusions\n\nThe large decay rate B \u2192 f0 (980)K and the excess of f0 (980) in the leading\npart of the gluon jet suggest the gluonic affinity of this meson similar to \u03b7 \u2032 and\ntherefore its flavour singlet nature. The further study of B decays into scalar\nparticles could be of invaluable help in establishing the members of the still\ncontroversial 0++ multiplet and its mixing. We also remark that the large\nexclusive decay rate for f0 (980) makes a 4-quark or molecular hypothesis\nunplausible as formfactors are expected rather to suppress this decay at the\nhigh energy of the B meson. Similarly, measurements of f0 (980) (also \u03b7 \u2032 ) in\ngluon jets with larger rapidity gaps for background suppression are desirable,\npossibly also from pp and ep collisions.\nOur interpretation of B \u2192 KKK decays in terms of glueball production\nshould be tested by observing the predicted missing channels (\u03b7\u03b7 and 4\u03c0)\nwith the rates expected for the flavour singlet (Table 3).\n11\n\n\fThe flavour singlet nature of f0 (980) does not necessarily imply a large\nmixing with a scalar glueball, such a large mixing is absent also in case of\n\u03b7 \u2032 . The near singlet flavour mixing of \u03b7 \u2032 and f0 (980) is intrinsically due to\ntheir gluonic couplings. In fact, taking the results of our glueball analysis\nfor granted with rate 132 \u00d7 10\u22126 then an upper limit for mixing results by\nassuming the full rate of f0 (980) production (14 \u00d7 10\u22126 ) to be due to mixing\n< (14/132) or \u03c6g \u223c\n< 20\u25e6 .\nwith glueball; then the mixing angle would be sin2 \u03c6g \u223c\nUltimately there is the question of how the b \u2192 sg decay is realized by\nhadronic final states. The large rate for the 0++ glueball we obtain suggests\nthe intriguing possibility that it could be saturated by gluonic mesons. In\nthe next step it will be interesting to search for the 0\u2212+ glueball which could\ndecay into \u03b7\u03c0\u03c0 and KK\u03c0. The candidate of lowest mass would be \u03b7(1440)\nwhich is strongly produced in radiative J/\u03c8 decays.\n\nReferences\n[1] A. Garmash et al., Phys. Rev. D 65 (2002) 092005.\n[2] K.
