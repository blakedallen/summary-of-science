INTRODUCTION\n\nNeutron stars, formed in the aftermath of core collapse\nsupernovae, are born rotating with spin periods that can\nbe down in the millisecond range. Coupled to this fast rotation, magnetic flux conservation in the imploding progenitor provides the nascent neutron star with magnetic\nfields in the range 1012 -1015 G, as confirmed by a variety\nof pulsar observations (Lyne & Graham-Smith 1997). A\ncustomary first approximation is to model the pulsar as\na rotating magnetic dipole which loses angular momentum through electromagnetic radiation. Consequently,\nthe star spins down and the decreased centrifugal force\ncauses the core density to rise. As this occurs, baryonic matter can undergo transitions to exotic phases of\nstrongly interacting matter, finally giving way to a phase\nin which quarks are deconfined. Such a deconfined phase\nmight explain the most energetic astrophysical phenomena such as gamma-ray bursts and cosmic rays from\ncompact objects (Ouyed, Ker\u00e4nen & Maalampi 2005a;\nOuyed, Rapp & Vogt 2005b). A phase transition to\nquark matter can result in the formation of a quark star,\nif certain stability criteria are fulfilled (Weber 2005).\nOur main objective in this letter is to obtain accurate\ntimescales for spin-down of a neutron star to the deconfinement density. Ultimately, we would like to know the\nlikelihood of a neutron star to undergo a phase conversion to a quark star. To this end, we explore 4 different EOS to determine plausible bounds on masses and\nspin-periods that are consistent with a phase transition\nto quark matter in the star's spin-down lifetime. Aspects of spin-down by magnetic braking and subsequent\ndeconfinement are outlined in section 2, along with the\napproximations made in this work. In section 3, we elabElectronic address: jstaff@phas.ucalgary.ca\n\norate on our computations and the EOS used (see Fig. 1),\nconnecting them to results displayed in Table 1 and Figure 2. Section 4 gathers our principal conclusions based\nupon an interpretation of results in Table 2 and Figures 3\n& 4.\n2. SPIN-DOWN AND DECONFINEMENT\n\nIt is well-known that the energetics of pulsed emission\nas well as unpulsed nebular radiation from a neutron\nstar can be generally understood as deriving from its\nrotational kinetic energy (Manchester & Taylor 1977).\nWhile the rotational power can be calculated from measurements of the spin-period (P ) and its derivative (\u1e56 ) in\na model-independent way, theoretical calculations linking surface magnetic fields with the spin-down rate (loss\nof rotational kinetic energy) require a model for the magnetic field configuration. In this paper, we assume a dipolar time-independent magnetic field for the sake of simplicity. Although more complicated configurations with\ntoroidal components are likely in reality, these will not\naffect our quantitative results which depend more on the\nabsolute strength of the magnetic field rather than its detailed shape. Further, surface magnetic fields are likely to\ndecay over a million years or so, and we do not consider\nthis complication here since its qualitative impact can\nbe easily inferred from our results. We further assume\nthat gravitational radiation is a negligible contributor to\nspin down, i.e. our neutron stars are born axisymmetric\nand remain as such, so that the spin-down rate of a neutron star is entirely due to dipolar magnetic field braking\nas given by (e.g. Deutsch 1955; Manchester & Taylor\n1977):\n2B 2 R6 \u03a93\nd\u03a9\nsin2 \u03c7\n=\u2212\ndt\n3Ic3\n\n(1)\n\n\fStaff et al.\n\n3. NEUTRON STAR MODELS AND EQUATIONS OF STATE\n\nIn order to explore the increase in central density due\nto spin-down, we create sequences of neutron star models using the RNS code (Stergioulas & Friedman 1995)\ndeveloped specifically to treat rapidly rotating neutron\nstars. Models in a particular sequence have the same\nEOS, constant baryon number, increasing central density and decreasing angular velocity. We assume that\nthe neutron star is born axisymmetric and initially rotates at Keplerian frequencies. For each sequence, the\n\n1036\n\n2\n\nP [dyne/cm ]\n\nwhere B is the equatorial surface magnetic field, I is the\nmoment of inertia, R the equatorial radius of the star,\n\u03a9 = 2\u03c0/P its instantaneous angular velocity and c the\nspeed of light. In equation (1) above, the inclination\nangle of the dipole (\u03c7) has been averaged over a sphere\nrepresenting a population of fixed mass and magnetic\nfield (hsin2 \u03c7i = 2/3). With all quantities expressed in\ncgs units, equation(1) can be integrated to yield the time\nfor a neutron star to spin down to a particular \u03a9. The\nadditional (implicit) input that is required to solve for\nthe spin-down time is the EOS, which determines the R\nand I for a given \u03a9.\nComputing the spin-down time to deconfinement\nrequires precise knowledge of the details of a phase\ntransition to quark matter. Although yet to be determined exactly from first principles, it is expected\nto occur on general grounds at high baryonic density, whose value depends on the EOS employed\n(Heiselberg & Pandharipande\n2000;\nGlendenning\n2000). If the interface tension between the quark\nand nuclear phases is too high, a first order phase\ntransition to a pure quark matter core at very high\ndensity (\u223c 10\u03c10 ) is likely, by which time the star\nmay become gravitationally unstable and collapse to\na black hole. Several other phases, such as mesoncondensed phases or structured nuclear matter can\nintervene at lower densities, softening the EOS. The\nconcomitant rapid contraction of the softer matter\ncan lead to non-monotonic behavior of the angular\nvelocity \u03a9 and cusps in the braking index n = \u03a9\u03a9\u0308/\u03a9\u03072\n(Heiselberg & Hjorth-Jensen 1998). It is also possible\nthat the transition from nuclear to quark matter at high\ndensity is second-order if the interface tension between\nthese phases is small enough. The transition may then\noccur smoothly over a range of densities from (4 \u2212 8)\u03c10\nwith an increasing proportion of quark matter in the\nmixed phase (Glendenning 1992), and a continuous\nvariation of the pressure and angular velocities. Our\nworking assumptions will be in line with the latter,\nand we choose a threshold deconfinement density of\n5\u03c10 . Obviously, our quantitative results depend on\nthis assumed value, but will remain qualitatively true\nirrespective of the transition density one may choose.\nWhen the central baryonic density reaches the critical\ndensity of \u03c1crit = 5\u03c10 , deconfined quark matter will\nappear in the inner regions of the neutron star. If the\nstrange quark matter hypothesis (Itoh 1970) holds true,\nit is possible that the entire star converts to a quark\nstar in a violent phenomenon termed the Quark Nova\n(Ouyed, Dey & Dey 2002; Ker\u00e4nen, Jaikumar & Ouyed\n2004). Aspects and consequences of the Quark Nova\nare discussed in Ouyed et al. (2005a) and Ouyed et al.\n(2005b).\n\n1035\n\nOBJ\nC\n1034\n\nAPR BBB2\n1033\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n\u03c1 [\u03c10]\n\n5\n\nFig. 1.- The EOS used (see \u00a73).\n\nRN S code outputs (among other physical quantities) I,\n\u03a9, and R, which feed into equation(1). We emphasize\nthat since the magnetic field does not appear explicitly in\nthe calculations performed by the RNS code, it does not\naffect the structural evolution of the star or the central\ndensity at which the transition to quark matter occurs.\nIn principle, extremely high magnetic fields exceeding\n1015 G can affect neutron star structure (Bocquet et al.\n1995). In our simplified approach, as per equation(1),\nthe magnetic field only determines the time to reach the\ndeconfinement density.\nWe employ 4 different EOS which are, in increasing order of stiffness:\nBBB2 (Baldo et al.\n1997),\nC\n(Bethe & Johnson\n1974),\nAPR\n(Akmal, Pandharipande & Ravenhall 1998) and OBJ\n(Jaikumar & Ouyed 2006). The pressure versus density\ncurve for each of the above EOS is plotted in Figure 1\nfor densities ranging from \u03c10 to 5\u03c10 . The OBJ EOS is a\nlot stiffer than the rest at high densities, due to strong\nrepulsion from vector mesons at short distances (details\nin Jaikumar & Ouyed 2006).\nThe minimum baryonic mass that is required for a\ngiven EOS to support spin-down to deconfinement is\nfound by the RNS code as the sequence that spins down\n\nSpin frequency [Hz]\n\n2\n\n1600\n1400\n1200\nOBJ\n\nAPR\nBBB2\nC\n\n1000\n800\n600\n400\n200\n0\n2\n\n2.5\n\n3\n\n3.5\n\n4\n\n4.5\n\n5\n\n5.5\n\n\u03c1cent [\u03c10]\nFig. 2.- Frequency vs central density for EOS used. All sequences are with constant baryonic mass and for minimum mass\nconfigurations (see Table 1). The minimum mass configurations\nare those that can reach a critical density of 5\u03c10 due to spin down.\n\n\fQuark deconfinement in Neutron stars\nto \u03c1crit at zero spin. The gravitational mass of such a\nmodel at zero spin is what we call minimum mass. Figure 2 displays the spin frequency of neutron stars with\nminimum mass, as a function of its central density. The\ncurves shown are for a 1.46M\u2299 star with EOS BBB2,\na 1.53M\u2299 star with EOS C, a 1.78M\u2299 star with EOS\nAPR, and a 2.8M\u2299 star with EOS OBJ (all masses are\ngravitational masses at zero spin).\nEquation (1) implies that it takes infinitely long to\nspin-down to zero frequency. In practice, we therefore\ncompute the time to reach within 1% of \u03c1crit , as illustrated in Figure 3. For a minimum mass star, we take\nthis time to be the maximum time for a star with a given\nEOS to reach deconfinement density. Neutron stars with\nmass lower than the minimum mass will not reach deconfinement density due to spin-down, and stars with\nhigher masses will reach the critical density sooner, before they have spun down completely. Conversely, a maximum mass can also be found, such that any mass beyond\nthis would already have central densities exceeding \u03c1crit\nat the Kepler frequency so that it is already in a deconfined state and spin-down causes no further change.\nThe minimum and maximum masses as described\nabove are listed in Table 1 for each EOS. Note that the\nOBJ EOS, on account of its stiffness, predicts a large\nminimum mass in order to spin-down to deconfinement.\nThe minimum density at Keplerian frequency required\nto reach deconfinement density (\u03c1min,K ) is lowest for the\nOBJ EOS and highest for the APR EOS (these are the\ntwo stiffest EOS). This is because the moment of inertia\nis so much larger for the OBJ EOS as compared to the\nothers, that it more than compensates for the increase in\nangular momentum with increasing stiffness of the EOS.\nThis also explains the lower spin frequency at a given\ncentral density for the OBJ EOS.\n4. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nThe maximum time to reach deconfinement via spindown can be read off from Figure 3 for each EOS for\nmagnetic fields in the range 1012 \u2212 1015 G. For any of the\nEOS, it takes up to a few hundred years for the star to\nspin down to 0.99\u03c1crit for a 1012 G magnetic field. This\ntime is drastically reduced to about an hour for a 1015 G\nmagnetic field. It is important to emphasize that the\ncurves in Figure 3 correspond to the minimum mass star\nin each case, i.e. it takes an infinite time for the magnetic\nfield to spin such a star down to \u03c1crit . In Table 2, we\ntherefore list the time it takes the star to increase its\ncentral density to within 1% of the critical density (i.e\n0.99\u03c1crit) due to spin down.\nFigure 4 shows the period as a function of time for\nTABLE 1\nColumnwise: minimum gravitational mass at zero spin,\nmaximum gravitational mass at Kepler rotation and\nminimum density at Kepler rotation that can reach the\ncritical density (\u03c1crit = 5\u03c10 ) due to spindown.\n\n3\n\neach EOS and for different magnetic field strengths.\nJust as before, this is for minimum mass stars and we\nplot the period until the central density is within 1% of\n\u03c1crit . It is noteworthy that the central density does not\nchange much after the rotation period slows to about\nPmax = 3ms (about 6 ms for the OBJ EOS). This is independent of the magnetic field since that only determines\nthe time to deconfinement, not the evolution of period\nwith time. From the above limiting value of the period,\nand the minimum mass results tabulated in Table 1 for\nour fiducial critical density of 5\u03c10 , we conclude that only\nstars with mass greater than about 1.5M\u2299 that have a\nspin period P < Pmax can reach a deconfined phase.\nConversely, if the star has P > Pmax as observed now, it\ncannot change its central density sufficiently to undergo\ndeconfinement due to spin down, and must either remain\na neutron star or have been born as a quark star.\nAlthough the critical density and consequently Pmax is\nnot known precisely, the range of currently observed isolated neutron star masses in conjunction with our study\nimplies that such stars can spin-down to a deconfined\nphase only if the deconfinement density is not too much\nabove 5\u03c10 . If the deconfinement density is much larger\nthan this, neutron stars in the currently observed mass\nrange (Stairs 2004) cannot increase their central densities enough via spin-down to reach the threshold, and\nwill remain neutron stars for their lifetimes. This conclusion can only be avoided by assuming that all neutron\nstars are actually quark stars and are born as such in the\naftermath of supernova explosions. Since most realistic quark matter EOS cannot support a maximum mass\ngreater than 1.6M\u2299 (see e.g. Dey et al. 1998), it is unlikely that this is true. We therefore believe that the\nexistence of quark stars is predicated upon having a low\ndeconfinement threshold (\u2264 5\u03c10 ). Once this threshold\nis pinned down via theoretical studies addressing Quantum Chromodynamics at high baryon density, we will be\nable to make more definitive statements about the existence of quark stars and related phenomena. Until then,\nthe possibility that some isolated neutron stars are really\nquark stars cannot be dismissed.\nWe thank S.
